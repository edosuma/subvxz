00:03.200 --> 00:03.567
- Previously

00:03.567 --> 00:04.200
- Previously
on Vanderpump Rules...

00:05.467 --> 00:06.767
Unfortunately,
James has been let go.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.333
- Tuesday's one of
our best nights.

00:08.367 --> 00:10.100
- It's upsetting that you guys
are thinking

00:10.133 --> 00:11.467
of a "business" point of view
instead of our feelings.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.100
It's really hurtful--
- Can't come to work.

00:13.133 --> 00:14.567
- Brittany.
- It's hurtful. I'm sorry.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.233
I'm, like, getting emotional--
- Out of all people.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.233
- I obviously miss
our friendship a lot,

00:18.266 --> 00:20.100
but I understand that I
----ed up, you know?

00:20.133 --> 00:22.233
- I'm here to support you
in whatever way you need.

00:22.266 --> 00:23.600
- Do you want to get
in the studio again?

00:23.633 --> 00:26.066
- (BLEEP) Yeah.
- Do I look literary chic?

00:26.100 --> 00:27.467
- You look like
Stephen King's daughter.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.100
You just need a knife
and some blood.

00:29.133 --> 00:31.166
- I got a freaking book deal.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.600
- He balances you out,

00:32.633 --> 00:37.233
but you're actually down here,
and he's up here.

00:37.266 --> 00:40.333
- You just contradict yourself
24/7. You just say things.

00:40.367 --> 00:42.333
- Can everybody stop
being selfish

00:42.367 --> 00:44.000
and thinking about themselves?

00:44.033 --> 00:46.166
- I feel like an outsider
for life.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.400
- I know. It's hard.

00:47.433 --> 00:49.367
- I want to go home.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.467

it's our time ♪

00:56.500 --> 01:01.400

01:25.300 --> 01:26.533
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.400
Look at this turnout.
This is great.

01:28.433 --> 01:30.433
- I'm glad this is a success.

01:30.467 --> 01:33.033
Sur never used to be open
for brunch, and now it is.

01:33.066 --> 01:35.333
- I love brunch.
- And then Billie had

01:35.367 --> 01:37.500
a really nice idea
that she wanted to host

01:37.533 --> 01:39.433
something to raise her profile
in West Hollywood.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.533
- Brunch with Billie
is happening. Yeah.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.300
- It's on her
to kind of promote it...

01:43.333 --> 01:44.633
- Hi.
- And have fun with it.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.667
- Hi.
- She's very committed to kind

01:46.700 --> 01:50.400
of raising the profile
of the LGBTQ community.

01:50.433 --> 01:51.567
- How's it going over there?

01:51.600 --> 01:54.400
- Nikolai is in his element.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.433
He's just like,
"Let's put this here," and...

01:56.467 --> 01:58.400
- Hello.
- And I'm so involved

01:58.433 --> 01:59.533
in the whole--hello.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.200
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.567
- Hi.
- What are you...

02:02.600 --> 02:04.266
- I just came to say--
- Doing here exactly?

02:04.300 --> 02:06.166
- I just came to say hi
to Billie.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.600
I'm not drinking
or anything, obviously.

02:07.633 --> 02:10.433
- Did you hear about how Billie
was defending you?

02:10.467 --> 02:11.633
- At the meeting, yeah.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.200
- One last thing
about Kristen, actually.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.500
She's a trigger.
She walks in here,

02:14.533 --> 02:16.333
and she attacks James
every single time.

02:16.367 --> 02:17.667
- When you were insulting
Katie,

02:17.700 --> 02:19.500
I don't know
that Billie was privy to it.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.066
- I think she was.
I think she was.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.600
She's definitely
heard enough of it.

02:22.633 --> 02:25.500
We get along great,
and I came to support her today

02:25.533 --> 02:28.300
on her brunch, and that's that.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.200
- Well, I'm glad to see you
sober,

02:30.233 --> 02:32.600
'cause that's the important
step in the right direction.

02:32.633 --> 02:34.467
- Hey.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.633
- Hey, thanks for having
my back at the staff meeting.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.166
- Yeah.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.400
- I heard you were there
for me.

02:39.433 --> 02:41.333
To an amazing brunch.
- Thank you.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.734
- It's going well.
- Yeah, it's busy.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.600
And it's good vibes.
- Thanks for the drink, hey.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.500
- I'm gonna let you guys chat.
- People love it, yeah.

02:48.533 --> 02:51.233
Thanks,
and I'm grateful for you.

02:51.266 --> 02:52.734
- Happy to support.

02:52.767 --> 02:55.133
Excuse me,
who are you making that for?

02:55.166 --> 02:56.533
- It's called the stay-cation.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.367
- I've got to try
and stay sober,

02:58.400 --> 03:02.166
because I'm going up to
Stassi's--

03:02.200 --> 03:03.500
what's it stand for again?

03:03.533 --> 03:05.100
- OOT--Outfit Of The Day.

03:05.133 --> 03:07.500
She bought a holiday.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.133
- Move the tables around
so that

03:14.166 --> 03:16.133
in front of the flower wall

03:16.166 --> 03:18.200
there's room for people
to take photos,

03:18.233 --> 03:19.633
and the photographer
can be there.

03:19.667 --> 03:23.233
I'll probably be there in,
like, an hour. Thank you.

03:23.266 --> 03:26.333
Outfit Of The Day is something
I talk about on my podcast.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.266
I'm gonna write about it
in my book,

03:28.300 --> 03:30.400
and it's something that
I look forward to every day.

03:30.433 --> 03:35.633
So national OOTD day is now
a holiday that I started.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.367
OOTD.
- No. No!

03:41.400 --> 03:42.767
- Yes.
- No.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.700
- I feel comfortable in this.

03:44.734 --> 03:46.667
- Can you find something that
you're just as comfortable in

03:46.700 --> 03:50.533
that's not that?

03:50.567 --> 03:54.367
National OOTD day
is all about being yourself;

03:54.400 --> 03:57.667
expressing your individuality
and your unique style,

03:57.700 --> 04:00.400
but, like, I have to draw
the line somewhere,

04:00.433 --> 04:02.467
and that line is at overalls.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.367
I just talked to the florist,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.667
and so she's already there
just setting everything up.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.667
It's way much more fun to,
like, sit back

04:09.700 --> 04:13.467
and delegate than actually,
like, do the heavy lifting.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.300
- How many parties
have you done?

04:15.333 --> 04:16.700
- None, Kristina.
This is my first one.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.567
- Lisa's hard to impress.
- Shut up.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.367
- Well, I'm happy that you
actually finally got it going.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.233
- And it was really hard.

04:24.266 --> 04:27.300
I had to find what this, like,
company was that, like,

04:27.333 --> 04:29.333
does all of these national
holidays.

04:29.367 --> 04:30.700
And then they were like,

04:30.734 --> 04:32.300
"Well, you have to,
like, get a website."

04:32.333 --> 04:34.233
And so then once they
approved it,

04:34.266 --> 04:35.633
I'm a ----ing holiday owner.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.266
- Whoop-whoop.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.700
- Lisa doesn't even
own a holiday.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.567
- Shh.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.533
- With Patrick, he thought
that the OOTD thing was

04:43.567 --> 04:45.467
so cringey
that, like, I would have to go

04:45.500 --> 04:47.433
and, like, sneak off
and take my photos.

04:47.467 --> 04:50.600
Like, with Beau, he's
so supportive to the point

04:50.633 --> 04:53.700
where he even made me
this hashtag OOTD sign

04:53.734 --> 04:55.367
above my full-length mirror.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.000
It's the sweetest thing.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.700
- So with everything else,
how are you feeling?

04:58.734 --> 05:00.567
- With my mom?
- Yeah.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.600
- I mean, I feel
really frustrated.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.467
I just feel like
I'm doing everything

05:05.500 --> 05:08.333
I possibly can to be good,
and no matter what,

05:08.367 --> 05:10.700
my mom's constantly telling me
that I'm not good.

05:10.734 --> 05:12.600
- I don't want you to,
you know.

05:12.633 --> 05:13.700
- To what?

05:13.734 --> 05:17.333
- Be yourself and mess it up.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.567
- I just feel like I need

05:18.600 --> 05:20.200
a really long break from her.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.433
Like, I can't deal with it. I--

05:22.467 --> 05:23.667
- All right.
Shake it off, all right?

05:23.700 --> 05:27.600
- I hate this.
- Today's gonna be good.

05:27.633 --> 05:29.567
Don't get in your head
about this stuff, okay?

05:29.600 --> 05:32.500
- I'm not. I'm a holiday owner.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.066
Okay, can we, like,
pick out a new outfit for you?

05:37.100 --> 05:38.467
- Yeah.
- I've been looking forward

05:38.500 --> 05:39.633
to this day
for a really long time...

05:39.667 --> 05:41.266
- I know.
- And I want to have fun.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.333
- All right, I brought options.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.000
- This is great.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.333
Everybody's having a great
time.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.767
It's packed in here.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.300
- You know, I'm just all about
bringing the good vibes,

05:53.333 --> 05:54.567
like, during the day.
- You do.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.066
- That kind of thing. Yes.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.567
- Hi, you.
- Hi.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.433
- You have a res?
- Yes. It's just two of us.

06:00.467 --> 06:03.266
- ----ing really?
Kristen's here?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.033
Like, why are they here?

06:05.066 --> 06:06.500
- Lisa's banned Kristen

06:06.533 --> 06:08.266
from the restaurant,
like, four times.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.633
- Well, you need to re-ban her.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.700
Seeing Kristen at my brunch
is annoying.

06:11.734 --> 06:14.033
She just wants to start sh--,
and that's her thing.

06:14.066 --> 06:17.000
- He needs to learn
how to act like a ----ing man,

06:17.033 --> 06:18.500
like a human.

06:18.533 --> 06:19.567
- Are you gonna go to Sur
ever again?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.533
'Cause he works there.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.000
- No, he doesn't. He's fired.
- No, he doesn't. He got fired.

06:23.033 --> 06:24.367
- Her energy smells
like dogsh--.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.467
- Avocado toast.
- Katie's fave.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.333
- So I think I have
to have that.

06:28.367 --> 06:32.100
- Kristen, be gone with
your negative-ass vibes.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.066
Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.667
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

06:38.700 --> 06:39.667
- Good.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.633
Random to see you here.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.367
- We're just grabbing food
on the way to Stassi's party.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:45.734 --> 06:49.633
I'm gonna go after
I'm off work, but yeah,

06:49.667 --> 06:51.734
last time we, like,
talked it was, like, not good.

06:51.767 --> 06:54.333
You were talking about
James negative the entire time.

06:54.367 --> 06:55.600
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

06:55.633 --> 06:56.734
You really don't.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.433
- James is one
of my close friends.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.367
- Brought you some flowers,

07:00.400 --> 07:01.700
but I brought another type
of flower too,

07:01.734 --> 07:04.433
if you get my vibe,
if you get my vibe.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.033
- Yes.
- I'm not telling you

07:06.066 --> 07:07.567
don't be friends with him.
That's your choice.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.433
- Look, I personally think
you're toxic,

07:09.467 --> 07:11.467
because I think you're holding
on to so much anger with James.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.633
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't (BLEEP) James.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.433
I wasn't intimate
with James, but James...

07:15.467 --> 07:16.633
- I'm glad for you.
- Is one of my close friends.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.033
I just don't like that
you're, like,

07:18.066 --> 07:19.500
campaigning hate towards him.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.433
- Well, you were campaigning
to have her banned

07:21.467 --> 07:22.500
from here, so you're not...
- Yeah, I heard about that too.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.433
- Doing anything different.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.000
There are bottles of tequila
behind the bar that have been

07:26.033 --> 07:27.433
here longer than Billie has.

07:27.467 --> 07:28.567
I don't know why she's
acting like

07:28.600 --> 07:30.367
she owns the ----ing place.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.600
- The point is, you're causing
all kinds of drama

07:31.633 --> 07:34.533
with my friends.
I work here now. Not you.

07:34.567 --> 07:35.767
- Hey, and I'm here as a
customer,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.400
and you're causing drama
at my table,

07:37.433 --> 07:39.000
so that's kind of weird.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.133
- I'm sure I'll see
you guys later.

07:40.166 --> 07:43.667
Great talk.
Enjoy brunch.

07:47.767 --> 07:51.367
- ♪ In high dreams we gonna
make it ♪

07:51.400 --> 07:52.700
♪ On top of the world ♪

07:52.734 --> 07:54.734
♪ This is our empire ♪

07:54.767 --> 07:58.467
- Oh, my gosh. Holy sh--.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.600
Look at that.
That looks so good.

08:00.633 --> 08:03.567
This is, like, the beginning
of my own version

08:03.600 --> 08:06.133
of a Lisa Vanderpump-esque
empire,

08:06.166 --> 08:09.000
except, like, instead of being,
like, classy and elegant,

08:09.033 --> 08:10.734
it's, like, basic bitch.

08:10.767 --> 08:13.533
- Do I look very Nastassia
Schroeder today?

08:13.567 --> 08:16.133
- Yes.
- Happy OOTD?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.400
That is a good outfit.

08:18.433 --> 08:19.734
- You like it?
- I love it.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.400
- Hi.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.066
- Congratulations on
your Outfit of the Day.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.500
- Are you so happy?
- Yes.

08:24.533 --> 08:26.033
Thank you for coming.
- I love this.

08:26.066 --> 08:27.166
- Thank you.
- No, this is so dope.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.567
Hi.
- Hi, this is so cool.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.133
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.700
- Photo booth is over there.

08:32.734 --> 08:34.133
There's a photographer
getting images.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.500
- You hired a photographer?
- Yes.

08:35.533 --> 08:37.100
And hashtag as much
as you can.

08:37.133 --> 08:41.467
- I'm off-duty now,
so I can flex my OOTD.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.600
- By the way, I just got
inspiration for a new holiday.

08:43.633 --> 08:45.200
I'm not gonna upstage you.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.767
National muumuu day.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.100
I'm taking the muumuu off.
- It's a muumuu day.

08:49.133 --> 08:50.667
- I don't even know where
to begin with this thing.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.367
- It's not so bad.
- Not only that, it's pink.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.166
- Oh, my God. I look handsome.
Holy sh--.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.633
- This is really cute.
- I know.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.100
- I'm really proud of it.
- Yeah.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.567
- Lisa doesn't even
have her own day.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.233
I thought about, like,
how the situation

09:01.266 --> 09:04.000
with that meeting--like,
was I a little disrespectful?

09:04.033 --> 09:06.233
- You guys make digs at each
other really bad...

09:06.266 --> 09:08.000
- And I told--
- Like, him and Lisa.

09:08.033 --> 09:09.734
- Yeah.
- This my girlfriend,

09:09.767 --> 09:12.066
my fiancée, my future wife,
so she's sitting here crying.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.533
I'm not gonna sit here
and be like, "Well,

09:13.567 --> 09:14.667
you shouldn't have done that."
- Yeah.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.166
Being in conflict with anybody,

09:16.200 --> 09:18.667
let alone Lisa,
just makes me feel like

09:18.700 --> 09:21.200
I'm going to poop out
my stomach.

09:21.233 --> 09:24.000
I hate it so bad.

09:24.033 --> 09:26.000
- You guys went
to brunch just now?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.533
- So me and Kris are sitting
there

09:27.567 --> 09:29.166
eating our avocado toast,
and Billie comes up.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.133
She goes, "The last time
we spoke it wasn't so good,"

09:32.166 --> 09:34.600
and we're like--and she's like,
"So random to see you here."

09:34.633 --> 09:36.533
I'm like, "I worked here
a decade. And...

09:36.567 --> 09:37.767
- Yeah. ----ing Billie. Ugh.
- "We're just sitting here

09:38.000 --> 09:39.433
as, like,
customers having--and you're

09:39.467 --> 09:40.633
coming up to us
and causing a problem?"

09:40.667 --> 09:42.533
- It's, like, pathetic to me.

09:42.567 --> 09:45.033
Now, can I tell you
I went and met with James,

09:45.066 --> 09:46.467
and he said, "Do you want to
come to the studio?"

09:46.500 --> 09:48.266
I said, "The studio's
a positive environment.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.767
I would love to come hear
what you worked on."

09:51.000 --> 09:53.433
So I'm gonna go there tonight.
- Wait.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.166
Wait, so you can't come over?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.100
'Cause I wanted all the girls
to come over, so we could,

09:57.133 --> 10:00.567
like, make the flyer and start
promoting for Tuesday.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.266
In place of See You
Next Tuesday,

10:02.300 --> 10:04.600
I figure why not have
a girls' night?

10:04.633 --> 10:07.567
I want all us girls to come
together and have, like,

10:07.600 --> 10:10.433
something for Tuesdays
to fill that void.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.233
- Why don't you have fun
this Tuesday?

10:12.266 --> 10:15.633
- It'll be epic.
So I am very confused

10:15.667 --> 10:19.133
as to why Lala would even
want to hang out with James,

10:19.166 --> 10:21.100
especially when we're
all supposed to be planning

10:21.133 --> 10:22.600
this girls' night
for next week.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.200
What are you going
to the studio for?

10:24.233 --> 10:27.266
- I mean, I would rather come
to your apartment.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.066
- Why doesn't Tom Sandoval
go to the studio

10:29.100 --> 10:30.500
with him with his trumpet?

10:30.533 --> 10:32.633
- Here's the thing.
James Kennedy was,

10:32.667 --> 10:35.266
at one point, the only person
that was my friend

10:35.300 --> 10:37.500
and the only person
that was nice to me.

10:37.533 --> 10:42.166
- I appreciate that,
but--I don't know.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.567
I love you no matter what.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.100
- You think it's just a lost
cause.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.500
- I do think it's a ----ing
lost cause,

10:46.533 --> 10:49.033
because there is
no action from him.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.567
- The only way for him
to hit rock bottom

10:50.600 --> 10:53.533
is to, like, 100% lose you.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.600
- After coffee with James,

10:55.633 --> 10:59.200
I honestly had my guard down,
and I felt for the kid.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.100
- Because he thinks, like,

11:01.133 --> 11:04.033
"Oh, I saw Lal yesterday.
She's gonna come to the studio.

11:04.066 --> 11:06.033
It's all good."
That's what he's thinking.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.500
- Yeah.
- I guarantee.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.300
- Now, talking to Katie
and Kristen,

11:09.333 --> 11:11.133
my gut is speaking to me,

11:11.166 --> 11:13.500
and I just feel like
he played me again,

11:13.533 --> 11:15.533
and Lala is no fiddle.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.200
Yeah. For him,
this could very well be

11:18.233 --> 11:20.133
a mixed signal--me going there.
- Yeah.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.033
- Coming up...

11:23.066 --> 11:24.600
- You and Jax, like,
are--you guys,

11:24.633 --> 11:26.000
like, go at each other.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.266
- Why should we go
at each other?

11:27.300 --> 11:28.667
- No, I know--
- He's working for me.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.166
He needs to show some
----ing respect.

11:38.166 --> 11:38.633
- The styles that I like

11:38.633 --> 11:39.233
- The styles that I like
the most are classic,

11:40.734 --> 11:43.000
and feminine, and timeless.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.300
- No shots right now.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.033
I'll do one with you
in about 20 minutes though.

11:53.066 --> 11:54.300
- Hi.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.200
- Well, this is
the outfit of the day.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.567
- You look fantastic.
- I think Stassi's right that

11:57.600 --> 11:59.233
when people get dressed up,

11:59.266 --> 12:02.000
it really does enhance
your self-esteem,

12:02.033 --> 12:05.667
so I'm all for Outfit
of the Day day.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.400
I personally have
365 of them a year.

12:10.266 --> 12:12.266
- You look really
handsome today.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.033
- Thank you.
- You always look handsome.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.033
I told Ariana I want you guys
to make a baby.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.700
- Can we do it in a test tube

12:18.734 --> 12:21.567
and then, like,
grow it in a jar somewhere?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
- Sure.
- You know what I'm dying for?

12:23.633 --> 12:26.600
I'm dying for the day
that men can carry babies.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.400
- At this point,
me being pregnant

12:28.433 --> 12:30.333
might be the only way Ariana

12:30.367 --> 12:33.400
and I will give birth
to a child, so yeah,

12:33.433 --> 12:34.700
knock me the (BLEEP) up.

12:34.734 --> 12:37.166
- Hi, Lisa.
- Lisa!

12:37.200 --> 12:38.767
- You always have an outfit
of the day.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.200
- You always have
an outfit of the day.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.600
- Some of us have been
at Tom Tom.

12:42.633 --> 12:44.333
- Exactly.

12:44.367 --> 12:47.433
Ken and I have been working
tirelessly on this project.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.633
Ugh. I'll do two, yeah.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.066
I remember when I used
to be sitting in London

12:53.100 --> 12:54.734
eating bonbons.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.066
- When is the big reveal?
When do we get to see it?

12:57.100 --> 13:00.033
- In a few days
when I've got things unwrapped

13:00.066 --> 13:01.700
and things in place.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.734
Me telling Tom and Tom
not to be around

13:03.767 --> 13:05.333
is a little bit like, you know,
when Mommy says,

13:05.367 --> 13:07.133
"Keep out of the kitchen,
darling.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.734
I want it to be a surprise."
You know what I mean?

13:11.233 --> 13:13.066
- I want to see, like,

13:13.100 --> 13:16.133
how many people posted
with the national OOTD hashtag.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.367
- Look.
Look at all the stories.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.133
- Oh, sh--.
- Look at that.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.467
One, two, three...
- Oh, my God. I didn't--

13:20.500 --> 13:22.233
- Four, five, six.
Look at that.

13:22.266 --> 13:23.700
It just keeps going.
- Wait. That's so cool.

13:23.734 --> 13:25.467
Twitter's on fire.
That's awesome.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.233
- It's so weird that there are,
like, all of these ----ing

13:27.266 --> 13:29.133
people just out there just
----ing taking photos

13:29.166 --> 13:30.400
of their outfits.
Like, I'm just--

13:30.433 --> 13:33.467
that is--that's cool.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.300
I love it.
So many people are saying,

13:35.333 --> 13:37.767
"I'd never felt confident
enough to post an OOTD before,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.767
but thanks to you, I did,
and I felt amazing."

13:41.000 --> 13:42.333
I love that.

13:42.367 --> 13:44.333
Every year,
more people will know about it,

13:44.367 --> 13:46.300
and more people
will post about it.

13:46.333 --> 13:49.367
And one day, it could become
a federal holiday, and banks

13:49.400 --> 13:52.433
and schools will even close,
so you're welcome.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.233
- Congrats.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.100
- Now we can relax and get
drunk,

13:57.133 --> 13:59.400
and I won't be mean,
'cause I love you so much.

13:59.433 --> 14:00.467
- I swear.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.066
- Oh, do you?
- Really.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.333
I'm gonna try so hard.
- I know.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.166
- I really, for real, am.
- Mm-hmm.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.667
Give me that hamburger.
Give me that hamburger.

14:06.700 --> 14:10.000
Oh, oh.

14:10.033 --> 14:13.266
That's love, baby.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.467
That's really gross.
- That was actually so gross.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.700
- Don't talk to me for,
like, five minutes.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.333
- Do you want to--you do it
or me do it?

14:20.367 --> 14:23.734
- You're better at selfies
with two people.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.433
- Yeah!
- Perfect.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.667
- Gorgeous girls.
- Hi. Thank you.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.500
- You look beautiful,
as always.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.533
I've been--okay, I've been,
like, a nervous wreck,

14:32.567 --> 14:34.700
because I never speak my mind.

14:34.734 --> 14:36.367
Sorry that you're, like--
- No, it's okay.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.166
I'm gonna let you guys talk.
- I just wanted--

14:39.200 --> 14:41.000
I just wanted to say when I
first saw you meet--

14:41.033 --> 14:43.166
'cause, like, at the meeting
and stuff I just--I don't ever

14:43.200 --> 14:45.333
speak my mind,
so whenever I, like, did, it,

14:45.367 --> 14:47.734
like--I have not been able
to think about anything else,

14:47.767 --> 14:49.333
'cause I didn't want you
to be mad at me.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.700
'Cause whenever you came back,

14:50.734 --> 14:52.433
and you were like,
"I'm disappointed..."

14:52.467 --> 14:54.100
- Will you stop pointing...
- "In you for saying that."

14:54.133 --> 14:55.233
- Your fingers in my face?
- I'm sorry.

14:55.266 --> 14:56.500
Well, you pointed at me
and said,

14:56.533 --> 14:58.300
"I am disappointed in you
for saying that."

14:58.333 --> 15:00.166
- I'm just saying, in the past,
I think you've had

15:00.200 --> 15:04.133
a pretty good example
that all the decisions I make

15:04.166 --> 15:06.500
are not necessarily
purely financial.

15:06.533 --> 15:10.467
If I based every decision I
made on business and money,

15:10.500 --> 15:12.300
Jax Taylor wouldn't
still be here.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.000
How about that?

15:14.033 --> 15:16.734
- It just got so crazy
at the meeting, and it's--

15:16.767 --> 15:18.433
- Well, when he's yelling at
me,

15:18.467 --> 15:20.066
"How many times
has he been fired?"

15:20.100 --> 15:22.033
What the hell's it got
to do with him?

15:22.066 --> 15:23.333
- How many times--can I ask how
many times he's been fired?

15:23.367 --> 15:25.000
- Jax.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.200
- I don't need
peanut gallery opinions.

15:26.233 --> 15:27.500
I care less
what any of you say.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.367
I don't give a (BLEEP)
what any of you say.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.767
- But you're lucky to be here
as well, quite frankly.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.200
- Then you don't have
to have me here.

15:32.233 --> 15:33.333
- Not everything is
black and white.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.734
- I know.
- Hey, guys.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.100
You know,
it's not all--hello, Jax.

15:36.133 --> 15:37.333
- Sorry, I didn't mean to
interrupt.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.200
- Yeah. Hi.
- How are you? You okay?

15:39.233 --> 15:41.133
- Yeah. No, I was just telling
Lisa, like, whenever stuff

15:41.166 --> 15:43.300
like that happens I can't
think about anything else,

15:43.333 --> 15:45.266
and, like, from, like,
the meeting and stuff.

15:45.300 --> 15:49.266
- Oh, oh, oh. When I see
my girlfriend crying--fiancée--

15:49.300 --> 15:51.467
fiancée crying, I mean,
I got to side with her.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.567
I got to be on her team.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.467
- A kind of negative attitude

15:54.500 --> 15:56.300
to me
I'm not really ready for again.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.133
- What negative attitude?
I haven't had an attitude.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.100
- Well, you know, you had a
little bit of attitude, and I--

16:00.133 --> 16:02.233
- Because I'm protecting you.
- I know, but...

16:02.266 --> 16:04.000
- And I'm upset,
and I want to make sure.

16:04.033 --> 16:05.433
- It's just like--
- Protecting your partner

16:05.467 --> 16:08.266
and your loved one without
being negative and rude.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.367
I'm sorry. Maybe you haven't
learned that skill.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.066
Maybe I should teach it to you.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.233
- You've got somebody
on the street there

16:13.266 --> 16:14.500
that needs a lot of help.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.467
That's who you should focus on.
James, not me.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.166
- No, I never need your advice
on what I should focus on.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.233
- I know you don't, but I'm...
- Okay, well, thank you.

16:20.266 --> 16:22.166
- I'm just saying.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.467
- I've always thought that
I kind of made him look better,

16:23.500 --> 16:25.100
in other people's eyes,

16:25.133 --> 16:26.767
but now that Jax
and I are engaged,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.133
whenever he acts like this,
it makes me look worse.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.400
- I was actually talking
to Brittany, so...

16:31.433 --> 16:33.600
- I'm just coming over--I was
coming over to apologize.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.200
That's all.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.467
- Oh, you came over
to apologize?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.133
- I was and make sure
she was okay.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.333
- I missed the apology,
by the way.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.200
- What?
- I missed the apology.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.533
- I said I'm sorry. I apologize
for my body language.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.233
- And the way you spoke, maybe?

16:44.266 --> 16:46.266
- And the way
I--maybe the way I spoke.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.000
- Okay, great. Thank you.
That's good.

16:48.033 --> 16:49.633
- All right. I'll see you.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.500
I feel like I can never
really win with Lisa.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.166
I mean, I feel like
she's always gonna treat me

16:53.200 --> 16:54.533
like the old Jax.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.266
James can be literally
setting fire to the

16:56.300 --> 16:58.066
----ing restaurant,
and they would say,

16:58.100 --> 17:00.400
"Well, Jax, you know,
you thought about doing

17:00.433 --> 17:02.266
something like this one time,
didn't you?"

17:02.300 --> 17:04.500
- I don't need to have somebody
talk to me like that.

17:04.533 --> 17:06.433
- You and Jax, like,
are--you guys,

17:06.467 --> 17:08.600
like, go at each other.
It's, like, the craziest thing.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.500
- But why should we go
at each other?

17:10.533 --> 17:13.100
- No, I know--
- He seeks employment from me.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.433
- Yeah.
- He's working for me.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.600
He needs to show some ----ing
respect.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.467
Coming up...

17:20.500 --> 17:22.400
- Yeah, I'm already on the brim
of, like, freaking out,

17:22.433 --> 17:25.433
so, like...
- Why are you freaking out now?

17:25.467 --> 17:28.033
- I don't understand.
- She's, "Raah."

17:28.066 --> 17:31.133
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.400
- Hello.
Hi. Oh, hi.

17:42.433 --> 17:43.467
Are you by yourself?
- Hi. I am.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.300
- So everyone's an hour late.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.600
- I thought I was gonna be
the last person here.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.266
- We came home,

17:51.300 --> 17:53.333
and then Jax was
over here yelling.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.233
He's like,
"Brittany's stressed out."

17:55.266 --> 17:56.600
I'm just like,
"Bro, like, no offense,

17:56.633 --> 17:58.433
but shouldn't you be enjoying,
like the time..."

17:58.467 --> 18:00.100
- Yeah.
- "With your fiancée

18:00.133 --> 18:01.567
before you get married?"
- And I'm not doing this

18:01.600 --> 18:03.233
for the next year.
- I'm not doing this, where...

18:03.266 --> 18:04.433
- This is, like...
- For the next year.

18:04.467 --> 18:05.633
Hell to the no.
- Jax is, like,

18:05.667 --> 18:07.500
making everything about...
- No.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.333
- His ----ing wedding.
- Jax came over to my apartment

18:09.367 --> 18:11.734
screaming about how Lisa
was getting on Brittany's case,

18:11.767 --> 18:15.200
about whether Jax
is really changed,

18:15.233 --> 18:17.233
and he just kept screaming,
like,

18:17.266 --> 18:19.233
"We're getting married.
Everyone deal with it."

18:19.266 --> 18:21.700
Bro, you have 11 months
to your wedding.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.333
Like, chill the (BLEEP) out.

18:23.367 --> 18:24.667
Oh, my God. There--

18:24.700 --> 18:26.166
- Oh, there you are.
- Hi.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.266
- Hi.
- Just called you.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.633
- What's the point of this,
real quick? Like--

18:29.667 --> 18:31.400
- Okay. We got to figure out
Tuesday.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.100
It's like, "What do you want
to do with your gown?"

18:33.133 --> 18:34.333
Do you want to...
- Party, rage...

18:34.367 --> 18:35.734
- Party, rage.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.734
Get a neck rub
and some glitter.

18:37.767 --> 18:41.400
- Can everyone forget about
whoever James Kennedy is?

18:41.433 --> 18:42.767
- Everyone keeps talking about

18:43.000 --> 18:44.667
how they're not gonna make
as much money,

18:44.700 --> 18:47.266
because there's not gonna be
any "See You Next Tuesdays."

18:47.300 --> 18:49.533
Well, guess what. Girls' night
in is about to blow that sh--

18:49.567 --> 18:51.633
out of the water,
and we don't need James.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.767
- Five hot bitches are a way
bigger deal than he is.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.600
- Wait, did Thomas go
to the studio tonight?

18:56.633 --> 18:59.200
- He did, and then James said
to bring his trumpet.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.133
- And I was like,
"Tom, please don't."

19:09.700 --> 19:12.266
- Do you guys like that or no?
- Yes, I love that.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.133
- Why don't you make me
sound like Lala?

19:15.166 --> 19:16.667
I'm kidding.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.166
- I was expecting something
sexy and sultry, you know.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.533
Lala could have pulled
that off for me.

19:20.567 --> 19:21.767
♪ Do-do-do ♪

19:24.600 --> 19:25.767
- Sh--.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.300
- Tom, you got to get that
perfect.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.166
- Sorry.
- I see Lala pulling up

19:29.200 --> 19:31.567
to coffee in her Rolls Royce
and stuff like that,

19:31.600 --> 19:34.533
but I'm paying out of pocket
for my studio sessions,

19:34.567 --> 19:36.166
and if you're telling me
that you're gonna come,

19:36.200 --> 19:38.600
then you may as well ----ing
show up.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.433
That was nice. That was nice.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.433
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, man.

19:42.467 --> 19:44.266
This is gonna sound
really cool.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.734
- Don't make it to where
it sounds synthetic.

19:45.767 --> 19:49.567
- Right. No, I love the organic
sound to it.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.166
- It's just as good as Lala.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.633
- Yeah.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.367
- Lala seemed like she was
really into the idea of

19:55.400 --> 19:57.300
you guys being friends again.

19:57.333 --> 20:00.000
- But you know how she, like,
gets--she gets good with Katie

20:00.033 --> 20:01.433
again and the girls,
and she feels like--

20:01.467 --> 20:02.734
- Are her and Katie
even, like--

20:02.767 --> 20:04.333
I haven't seen them hang out
in a minute.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.333
- All these girls
are followers, okay?

20:06.367 --> 20:07.667
- I love them too, but, like--
- They're all banding together

20:07.700 --> 20:09.400
and following each other
like chicks on a duck.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.467
- Does it have a name?
Have we given our baby

20:11.500 --> 20:13.533
a name yet?
- Well, girls' night. Eh.

20:13.567 --> 20:16.467
- I love it.
- Then we can dress like spa--

20:16.500 --> 20:18.000
- Like a silky--
- Silky robes.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.033
- Oh, my God. I just thought
of the hottest outfit.

20:20.066 --> 20:22.300
- And we can still be like--
- Now it's vibing now.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.667
We're vibing. I love you guys.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.600
- It's just who's the duck?
Who's the duck right now?

20:27.633 --> 20:29.266
Duck, duck, goose.
That's who it is.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.633
That's what this all is.
It's a child game.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.433
- I know it's a slap
in the face

20:32.467 --> 20:35.667
to hear that, you know,
Katie's now doing your Tuesday.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.734
- You know,
it is a gutting feeling.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.700
Ahh!

20:40.734 --> 20:43.767
Katie just won't stop
constantly reminding me

20:44.000 --> 20:45.500
of what a bitch she is.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.300
On Tuesday nights,
it's See You Next Tuesday.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.633
If she wants to come along
and just change the sign,

20:48.667 --> 20:50.667
change the name,
these people in there,

20:50.700 --> 20:51.767
they're
still there for me, babe.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.500
It doesn't work out like that.

20:53.533 --> 20:56.233
Hope it goes well.

20:56.266 --> 20:57.700
Hope it goes well for her.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.567
- So now I think the current
task is the flyer.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.467
- This is so, like, Craigslist.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.700
- They're just tits.

21:03.734 --> 21:06.400
Every single person
has seen my boobs

21:06.433 --> 21:08.233
probably
more than I've seen my own.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.433
Do they look even?
- Yes. No, you look great.

21:10.467 --> 21:12.367
- Yay! That's good.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.000
- Yeah, I think that's good.

21:14.033 --> 21:16.233
- So if you think I'm not gonna
bring the tits out

21:16.266 --> 21:18.333
for a good cause,
you're out of your mind.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.500
- Are we okay your fiancée
is in here like,

21:20.533 --> 21:24.567
"We're getting married."
I'm like, "Sounds like fun."

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
- Yeah, he's fine. Yeah--

21:26.633 --> 21:28.233
- Bro, take a breath.
- He's fine.

21:28.266 --> 21:29.600
That has to do
with other things.

21:29.633 --> 21:30.667
- He needs to chill out.
- I'm not gonna sit here

21:30.700 --> 21:31.767
and do that.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.533
- I know.
He needs to chill out.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.300
- He's sticking up for me.
I'm not gonna sit--no.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.767
I just feel like people
are waiting for me

21:37.000 --> 21:38.767
and Jax to mess up,
or that I'm hiding something,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.667
that we're not as good
as we really are.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.667
- Sandoval and Ariana were
talking about his track record.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.633
- Getting over being betrayed
takes a long time.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.500
- Yeah, it does.
I'm still working on it.

21:48.533 --> 21:51.000
- But you're lucky to be here
as well, quite frankly.

21:51.033 --> 21:54.300
- When are people going to
believe that we are happy?

21:54.333 --> 21:57.000
Oh, I'll go ahead and go home
if it's gonna be...

21:57.033 --> 21:58.667
- No, we're gonna talk about--
- About that.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.433
- No, no. Brittany, sit down.
No, Brittany, sit down.

22:00.467 --> 22:02.066
- No, we're not gonna
talk about that.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.433
- I know, but, like,
I'm already on the brim of,

22:03.467 --> 22:05.066
like, freaking out, so, like...

22:05.100 --> 22:06.767
- Why are you freaking out now?
- For me to...

22:07.000 --> 22:08.567
- Why is she freaking out?
- Freak out--like all of this.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.700
- Like...
- I just can't--

22:09.734 --> 22:11.700
- All of what?
- I can't do it.

22:11.734 --> 22:16.400
It's not gonna be, like, my
relationship is, like, ----ed.

22:16.433 --> 22:17.633
- I don't understand.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.300
- Not my relationship.

22:19.333 --> 22:23.066
I'm not doing this ----ing sh--
anymore.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.300
I'm about to lose it,
seriously.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.600
- What happened?
- Ugh.

22:27.633 --> 22:31.433
- Hey, are you all right?
- Just give me a second!

22:31.467 --> 22:33.500
- What's going on?
- She just--she lets very

22:33.533 --> 22:35.667
little things
affect her in a big way.

22:35.700 --> 22:38.100
- I feel like it was more of
a pile of things.

22:38.133 --> 22:41.333
It wasn't really just one thing
that she was upset about.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.066
- I don't know what to do.
She's going crazy.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.033
- I think just give her
a little bit of time right now.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.133
Give her some time.

22:46.166 --> 22:48.000
- She's, "Raah."
- Yeah.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.734
- She's--just let her freak out
for a sec.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.433
- Do you think you
should stay here--

22:51.467 --> 22:52.533
- I don't know what to do,
and I'm like,

22:52.567 --> 22:54.066
"What do want me to do?"

22:54.100 --> 22:55.467
She's like, "I don't care."
I'm like--

22:55.500 --> 22:56.567
- She said,
"I'm not mad at Katie.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.166
I'm not mad at any of you guys.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.667
I'm just having a really,
really bad, weird day."

22:59.700 --> 23:01.433
- I'll check in with you later.
- Maybe...

23:01.467 --> 23:03.600
- Sounds like it could be
some relationship sh--.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.166
I mean,
I would feel this way

23:05.200 --> 23:08.166
if I was marrying Jax.

23:08.200 --> 23:13.600
- Coming up...
- Oh, oh, oh! Ahh.

23:13.633 --> 23:16.433
Ahh.

23:25.734 --> 23:27.700
- You all right?

23:27.734 --> 23:31.100
Hey.

23:31.133 --> 23:33.033
What the hell's going on?
- Sorry I yelled at you.

23:33.066 --> 23:35.133
I'm just, like,
about to lose it.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.033
These are supposed to be
my best friends,

23:37.066 --> 23:39.033
and Katie says,
"Jax just came over here

23:39.066 --> 23:41.433
talking about the wedding.
Sounds fun."

23:41.467 --> 23:44.033
Like, kind of, like, sarcastic.
Like, I keep hearing about,

23:44.066 --> 23:45.667
like, Ariana and Tom
talking about us.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.700
And then Katie and Stassi asked
me about it the other day,

23:47.734 --> 23:50.533
and then I had this, like,
pit in my freaking stomach

23:50.567 --> 23:52.667
thinking that Lisa,
of all people, was mad at me.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.200
Then I finally get
to talk to her.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.600
Then you guys
start going at it.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.166
I feel like I'm constantly

23:57.200 --> 23:58.533
trying to keep the peace
between you guys, and then--

23:58.567 --> 23:59.767
- I--I was
sticking up for you.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.467
- I know you were, honey.
I know you were.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.166
I'm just saying.
- I'm like I'm damned if I do.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.667
I'm damned if I don't.
- I know that we have to prove,

24:05.700 --> 24:07.667
like,
that we're in a great place,

24:07.700 --> 24:09.500
because of everything
that we were in last year.

24:09.533 --> 24:10.767
- First of all, first of all--
- But--

24:11.000 --> 24:12.033
- No, no, no.
We don't have to prove

24:12.066 --> 24:13.734
to anybody, except ourselves.

24:13.767 --> 24:15.433
- It just breaks my heart
to hear all my friends

24:15.467 --> 24:16.700
trying to pull us back
to that same place.

24:16.734 --> 24:18.600
He is my future husband.

24:18.633 --> 24:20.533
I've made the decision
that I want to marry him,

24:20.567 --> 24:22.500
and I just want everybody
to be happy with us.

24:22.533 --> 24:24.233
- Don't worry about it.
Hey, don't worry about it.

24:24.266 --> 24:27.467
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.100
- Lala!
- Hi, my love.

24:42.133 --> 24:43.667
- Look at--you're so busy.
- Thank you.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.567
- You're so busy.
- Hi. Scheana.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.233
- Hi, Scheana. I'm Shannon.
- Nice to meet you.

24:47.266 --> 24:49.166
- Oh, wow.
- Scheana and Shannon.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.700
- Right?
That's a tongue twister.

24:50.734 --> 24:52.266
- Sit down, girls.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.000
By the way, tongue twisters
are wonderful.

24:54.033 --> 24:55.166
- I know, right?
- I know.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.667
- To get our mouths all warm.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.500
I've been dusting off
my acting chops.

24:58.533 --> 25:00.166
I got back with my old manager.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.066
I'm 33 now,

25:02.100 --> 25:05.567
but I just feel like I still,
like, could play college.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.600
- But then we're also gonna go
for maybe the young mom.

25:08.633 --> 25:12.033
- I haven't been in acting
class in a really long time.

25:12.066 --> 25:14.266
I usually prefer
to do cold reads,

25:14.300 --> 25:16.533
but we're gonna see
what this class is all about.

25:16.567 --> 25:19.100
- Lala, you are Scheana's boss.

25:19.133 --> 25:20.200
- Okay.
- She's been screwing up left,

25:20.233 --> 25:22.066
right, and center.

25:22.100 --> 25:24.033
- I know that a new job
is totally stressful, but--

25:24.066 --> 25:25.567
- I've been doing the best I
can.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.734
- I understand.
- First, I get divorced.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.767
Then I get right
into another relationship,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.633
and then that
just goes to sh--.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.166
- Scheana is just
being herself.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.600
I love acting because
I get to be anybody

25:37.633 --> 25:40.166
in the entire world
that is not Lala.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.000
- And I try and just put
on my happy face

25:42.033 --> 25:43.633
and act
like everything's perfect.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.033
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to waiting tables?

25:47.066 --> 25:49.000
- But Scheana is so damn vain

25:49.033 --> 25:51.667
that she can't imagine
being anybody but Scheana.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.300
- I want to play a little bit

25:53.333 --> 25:54.734
with creating illusions
with you guys.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.600
- Okay.
- Orgasms.

25:56.633 --> 25:59.767
- I never even had a real
orgasm until last year so--

26:00.000 --> 26:03.100
- Ah, well, it's good. Okay.
- Oh, you poor thing.

26:03.133 --> 26:04.734
- Sex was always good.
It always felt good.

26:04.767 --> 26:07.133
It just never--obviously,

26:07.166 --> 26:10.300
I am insanely good at acting,
because I've been acting like

26:10.333 --> 26:12.767
I've been having real orgasms
for the past decade.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.600
Maybe I just needed
to spice things up,

26:15.633 --> 26:18.633
switch up the dude, and boom.
I've had one.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.266
- Okay.

26:20.300 --> 26:24.000
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm gonna ---. I'm gonna ---.

26:24.033 --> 26:29.300
Oh, oh, oh.
Ahh.

26:29.333 --> 26:32.233
Ahh.

26:32.266 --> 26:34.033
I just (BLEEP).

26:35.400 --> 26:36.667
- See? That wasn't so terrible,
was it?

26:36.700 --> 26:39.133
- That was actually really fun.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.633
I feel like I just ----
emotionally kind of.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.734
- You did, so now, the reverse.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.266
- All right. Ready?
- I'm ready.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.000
- Okay.

26:49.033 --> 26:52.266
Oh, oh, oh.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.266
Oh, yeah.
Oh, right there.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.767
Oh, my God. I'm so wet.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh. Ahh.

27:01.033 --> 27:03.367
Ahh.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.633
- Well ----ing done.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.266
Oscar-winning performance

27:09.300 --> 27:12.767
for an orgasm
goes to Scheana Marie.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.266
- All right, ladies.
- That was so fun!

27:15.300 --> 27:17.133
- Thank you. I had no idea

27:17.166 --> 27:20.033
that Scheana could teach me
something in acting class.

27:20.066 --> 27:22.400
The orgasm kind of made
my ass sweat.

27:26.767 --> 27:28.266
- Yep.
- Honey, did you just feel

27:28.300 --> 27:30.700
a cold chill rush
into the apartment?

27:30.734 --> 27:32.166
- No, that would just be
Stassi.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.000
- Oh, okay.
- I'm just steaming out

27:34.033 --> 27:37.033
some robes for tonight.
- Why?

27:37.066 --> 27:39.100
- Because it's girls' night in.
- I love that.

27:39.133 --> 27:40.600
- Wait, wait.
You can wear pajamas?

27:40.633 --> 27:43.066
- I feel like this would make
a good OOTD.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.300
- It is.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.767
I mean the actual hashtag

27:46.000 --> 27:48.200
National OOTD Day
got over 1,000 posts.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.266
- I am so proud of you
and so impressed.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.000
Like, you really turned it out.

27:53.033 --> 27:55.066
- Thanks.
- I'm excited for tonight.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.734
- I'm excited for tonight.

27:56.767 --> 27:58.266
- You guys know I always like
to take the high road,

27:58.300 --> 28:01.000
and I do,
but just between us three,

28:01.033 --> 28:03.233
on some level,
I kind of want it to be more

28:03.266 --> 28:04.633
successful than James' night.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.233
- No sh--.

28:06.266 --> 28:07.700
- I want it to be
more successful,

28:07.734 --> 28:09.266
'cause I want
to make everyone happy.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.200
everyone that works there
and everyone that was,

28:11.233 --> 28:12.700
like, bumming on the fact

28:12.734 --> 28:14.633
that See You Next Tuesdays
were over.

28:14.667 --> 28:18.033
And then yesterday happened.

28:18.066 --> 28:19.433
Here's the deal.

28:19.467 --> 28:22.200
Billie Lee tweeted out,
"When your coworkers

28:22.233 --> 28:24.300
"don't include
the only trans girl

28:24.333 --> 28:27.133
"in girls' night
at your own job!

28:27.166 --> 28:28.300
"On the night you work!

28:28.333 --> 28:30.033
"Hashtag rude AF.

28:30.066 --> 28:32.266
Hashtag TransIsBeautiful."

28:35.200 --> 28:37.767
Billie is trying to insinuate

28:38.000 --> 28:42.166
that we purposefully left her
out because she's trans.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.333
Never for a minute did I think
that Billie wouldn't be there,

28:45.367 --> 28:48.233
and then even on Saturday night
Ariana said, like,

28:48.266 --> 28:49.667
"Hey, is it cool
if I tell Billie?"

28:49.700 --> 28:51.200
I was like, "Oh, my God.
Yes, of course."

28:51.233 --> 28:54.200
- Can we invite Billie,
since she works at Sur?

28:54.233 --> 28:56.367
- Listen, no.
Everyone's invited to the--

28:56.400 --> 28:58.433
I just--I don't need her,
like, help.

28:58.467 --> 29:00.266
- Okay, yeah.
- And I was like,

29:00.300 --> 29:02.066
"Let her know what's going on,"
and then she--now,

29:02.100 --> 29:03.433
like, gone on some kind of,
like, smear campaign

29:03.467 --> 29:05.633
to say that I, like,
purposely left her out.

29:05.667 --> 29:08.400
Like, I don't pretend to know
what kind of adversity

29:08.433 --> 29:10.066
she's had to overcome and face.
- Yeah.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.400
- I do know that since
we've met her,

29:11.433 --> 29:13.233
and she's told me her story,

29:13.266 --> 29:15.266
I've had nothing but compassion
and support for her.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.200
- My name is Billie Lee,
and I am transgender.

29:18.233 --> 29:19.400
- Whoo! Billie.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.066
- Happy Pride, everybody.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.233
- Happy Pride!

29:22.266 --> 29:25.100
all: Whoo!

29:25.133 --> 29:26.266
- And she knows that.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.467
- I don't like all that sh--
I saw

29:27.500 --> 29:29.266
on social media last night.
- Right.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.433
- Billie was like, "Oh,
leaving out the only trans girl

29:31.467 --> 29:33.767
on girls' night," and it was
like, "No, no, no."

29:34.000 --> 29:35.400
First of all, it is not
about you being trans,

29:35.433 --> 29:37.233
so don't get it twisted.

29:37.266 --> 29:39.433
- The fact that someone would
take that to the streets

29:39.467 --> 29:42.133
and put that out there like
that is extremely hurtful.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.400
I really liked Billie
when I first met her,

29:44.433 --> 29:48.233
but the past year, she has been
nothing but rude.

29:48.266 --> 29:50.233
- No phones allowed.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.100
- "No phones allowed."

29:52.133 --> 29:53.400
- She stirs the pot.

29:53.433 --> 29:55.233
- One last thing about Kristen,
actually.

29:55.266 --> 29:57.300
Whenever James is DJ-ing, she's
a trigger.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.767
- And now she's liking posts
that say the girls

30:01.000 --> 30:02.266
at Sur are transphobic.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.767
Yes, it is mainly directed
at Katie,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.033
but we're all clumped
into this too.

30:08.066 --> 30:09.467
It's the craziest thing to me

30:09.500 --> 30:12.200
putting it out there
that we're transphobic

30:12.233 --> 30:14.700
because you weren't tagged
in a ----ing picture.

30:14.734 --> 30:16.367
- It just made it
a way bigger thing.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.467
Now it's a thing.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.300
- If she was upset,
understandable.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.467
Totally relatable.
- Feel left out. Fine.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.266
- She felt left out, but...

30:23.300 --> 30:25.200
- That is totally fine
to feel left out.

30:25.233 --> 30:26.700
- Reach out to you individually
instead of going on Twitter

30:26.734 --> 30:29.300
and hurling insinuations and
sh--.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.166
- It's really simple.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.333
I only tag the people
in the Instagram post

30:33.367 --> 30:35.166
that helped me plan the party.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.433
She was on the schedule.
She was invited. End of story.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.333
- It's just crazy,
because it's the opposite

30:40.367 --> 30:42.000
of what her message is:

30:42.033 --> 30:44.467
namaste, love, acceptance,
hear people out.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.100
- Yeah.
- She never even gave me

30:46.133 --> 30:48.734
the
----ing benefit of the doubt.

30:48.767 --> 30:50.500
- Coming up...

30:50.533 --> 30:52.233
- You obviously don't get it,
'cause you're not coming...

30:52.266 --> 30:53.333
- You don't get it.
- From my experience.

30:53.367 --> 30:54.467
No, it's not my ----ing party.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.734
- Okay, let's
everybody--let's stop.

30:55.767 --> 30:57.100
- Cis privilege, for sure.

30:57.133 --> 30:58.567
- Cis privilege.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.300
Stop it.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.767
- ♪ Don't blame it on me ♪

31:11.000 --> 31:14.300
♪ Ha-oh♪

31:14.333 --> 31:17.533
♪ Don't blame it on me ♪

31:17.567 --> 31:18.600
- Katie.
- Hi.

31:18.633 --> 31:20.333
- How's it going?
- Good.

31:20.367 --> 31:23.133
I'm all ready
for girls' night in.

31:23.166 --> 31:26.100
- So is this like a response
to, like, See You Next Tuesday?

31:26.133 --> 31:28.000
'Cause, like, I mean, like,
James is here Tuesday,

31:28.033 --> 31:30.100
Thursday, Saturday.
I mean--

31:30.133 --> 31:32.300
- Cool, that's great
for him. This isn't about him.

31:32.333 --> 31:34.066
- Okay. All right.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.433
- This is a trial run,
but I think--I think...

31:35.467 --> 31:37.066
- It's a trial run?
- It's gonna be good.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.266
- All right, we'll find out.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.066
- It's a good thing.
- Okay.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.133
- It's a good thing.
- Okay. All right. Good thing.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.300
- It'll be great.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.533
Ha-ha.
- Hi.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.567
- Hi.
- Look at you. I love this.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.233
- There are so many people here
already.

31:48.266 --> 31:50.133
This room is packed.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.066
We've done so much work
to pull this night together.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.633
We've got some masseuse.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.633
We've got a sparkle bar.

31:55.667 --> 31:57.367
- Glitzy.
- We got a new DJ.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.333
DJ Mickey.
Hey!

31:59.367 --> 32:00.567
- Hey.
- Yay, yay.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.166
- Ready for tonight?
- Yes!

32:02.200 --> 32:05.100
DJ James Kennedy
is not the only person

32:05.133 --> 32:08.433
that can bring people into Sur
and make a ton of money.

32:08.467 --> 32:11.533
- Girls' night. I'm worried.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.633
- Excuse me.
Sorry. Thank you.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.467
Hi! I brought surprises and--

32:23.500 --> 32:25.133
- What is it?
- It's a shot.

32:25.166 --> 32:27.500
It's vodka, elderflower,
and lemon.

32:27.533 --> 32:29.266
And look, it looks like
liquid gold.

32:29.300 --> 32:31.300
- Ooh!
Ooh, that smells really good.

32:31.333 --> 32:35.667
What is it called?
- Disco tits.

32:35.700 --> 32:39.200
- Holy sh--.
It is so busy here.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.667
- Hey, guys.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.433
Can you believe how insane this
is?

32:42.467 --> 32:44.233
- There are so many
----ing people.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.600
- This is peak Sur!

32:45.633 --> 32:47.400
- This is like
an insane Saturday.

32:47.433 --> 32:50.400
- It just goes to show
the girls can step in,

32:50.433 --> 32:52.333
make sh-- happen. Boom.

32:52.367 --> 32:55.200
Sur doesn't need James
to be successful.

32:55.233 --> 32:57.200
I'm so proud of them.

32:57.233 --> 32:59.433
- Is every Tuesday
going to be girls' night?

32:59.467 --> 33:01.600
- You know, I really hope not.

33:01.633 --> 33:02.600
- Come in.

33:02.633 --> 33:04.467
- How's it going?

33:04.500 --> 33:08.100
- Welcome to See You
Next Tuesday/girls' night in.

33:08.133 --> 33:09.300
- Yeah. All right.
- Girls' night out.

33:09.333 --> 33:10.567
We got our robes.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.467
I have one for you...
- Oh, you do?

33:12.500 --> 33:14.433
- If you want to wear one.
It's pink though.

33:14.467 --> 33:16.467
- That's my power color.
Don't get me wrong.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.700
I'd like to be at the very
first girls' night in,

33:19.734 --> 33:22.433
but James, Raquel, and I
are gonna have our little

33:22.467 --> 33:25.100
night in with robes and rose.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.500
- Want a glass of rose?
- Sure.

33:26.533 --> 33:28.300
- It's not for me.
- Thanks.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.133
- I'm making a ----ing coffee.

33:30.166 --> 33:31.500
- I just want to make sure
I'm here for him.

33:31.533 --> 33:34.567
That was his night.
That was his identity.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.500
Yeah. Ariana just text me,
and she's like,

33:36.533 --> 33:39.500
"It's already,
like, packed over there."

33:39.533 --> 33:41.633
Schwartz said there's, like,
a line out the door.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.367
- Sh--.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.200
You know, it really
pisses me off

33:45.233 --> 33:46.734
that Katie chooses to have
her night on my ----ing

33:46.767 --> 33:48.433
See You Next Tuesday, okay?

33:48.467 --> 33:51.133
She just decides
to step in here. Make a flyer.

33:51.166 --> 33:53.367
Now Lala's tits are going
to get all the ----ing credit.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.266
Cheers.

34:14.734 --> 34:17.767
all: Whoo!

34:22.567 --> 34:24.467
- I mean, this is
a fabulous night.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.233
The bar's packed.
The girls have done it.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.266
Sure, James Kennedy's
not gonna be thrilled about it,

34:29.300 --> 34:31.200
but I have to give
the girls their due.

34:31.233 --> 34:34.266
I don't know what's happening
out there, but it's crazy.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.467
It's some kind of girl power,
or pussy power, or something.

34:44.467 --> 34:47.533
- Oh, hi. You look so hot.

34:47.567 --> 34:48.533
- I'm here.

34:48.567 --> 34:50.000
- Look at your boobs.

34:50.033 --> 34:51.633
Did they get bigger?
- Yes.

34:51.667 --> 34:52.734
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

34:52.767 --> 34:54.333
- Hi. How are you?

34:57.600 --> 34:59.300
- We need help.
- It's so busy.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.166
- We need help.
We need your help.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.600
- Obviously, I didn't plan
any of this.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.400
I wasn't included,
so here I am.

35:04.433 --> 35:06.333
- You weren't included?
What do you mean?

35:06.367 --> 35:07.700
- I didn't even know about
girls' night

35:07.734 --> 35:11.200
until they posted, and Katie
just, like, left me out.

35:11.233 --> 35:13.500
- Oh, Billie.
- As a child,

35:13.533 --> 35:16.200
I wasn't allowed
to go to girls' things,

35:16.233 --> 35:17.600
because I was born a boy,

35:17.633 --> 35:20.166
and so I would
miss out on things,

35:20.200 --> 35:22.700
and it would just make me feel
like I was wrong,

35:22.734 --> 35:26.567
so I felt just this rush of
shame

35:26.600 --> 35:29.233
when I wasn't included.

35:30.567 --> 35:32.467
- Can I get some service
over here, please?

35:32.500 --> 35:34.333
- It's madness.
- I know.

35:34.367 --> 35:36.333
You should, like, hop over.
Take a break.

35:36.367 --> 35:39.200
Like, I just really want
to talk to Billie.

35:39.233 --> 35:41.333
- I was crying--literally
crying yesterday and today.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.633
It's just a lot.
- One, two, three.

35:43.667 --> 35:47.233
- Woop! Oh.
- You look ----ing sexy.

35:47.266 --> 35:49.333
Her bod.
- Like, I can't get over

35:49.367 --> 35:51.467
the body chain
and the middle of the tits.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.266
- No, you look really,
really good.

35:53.300 --> 35:56.467
- You're looking good.
- How are you feeling, babe?

35:56.500 --> 35:58.033
- I'm really emotional.

35:58.066 --> 35:59.767
- I just don't want you to feel
like anybody

36:00.000 --> 36:02.700
was excluding you
from anything,

36:02.734 --> 36:04.600
because that was never our--
- But I wasn't included.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.400
- Why are you leaving out
the trans woman?

36:06.433 --> 36:08.433
- But she's not leaving you
out.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.667
This is becoming something
that it does not need to be.

36:10.700 --> 36:13.300
- You know, you and Katie
have a personal beef

36:13.333 --> 36:15.367
with each other
that needs to be worked out.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.400
I totally get that, but I also
get why you're feeling so hurt.

36:18.433 --> 36:20.767
I'm stuck in the middle
between two girls

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
that I'm really
good friends with,

36:23.033 --> 36:26.066
and I completely empathize with
where Billie is coming from,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.533
but at the same time,
Katie and Billie

36:28.567 --> 36:30.300
just had an altercation at
brunch.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.633
If I was Katie,
I probably wouldn't have

36:31.667 --> 36:33.333
invited her, either.

36:33.367 --> 36:35.033
- What is this--what
is going on?

36:35.066 --> 36:37.500
- Girl, you did not include me
in any of this.

36:37.533 --> 36:39.367
- This is for everyone.
- I've been rejected my entire

36:39.400 --> 36:41.066
life and not be able to go to
girls' things, and then...

36:41.100 --> 36:42.767
- This is not about that.
- A woman doesn't invite me--

36:43.000 --> 36:44.600
- Stop making this
about something that it's not.

36:44.633 --> 36:46.033
I had four days
to plan this out.

36:46.066 --> 36:47.600
I was like,
"Ariana, make drinks."

36:47.633 --> 36:49.533
Scheana helped me out.
Scheana helped me out.

36:49.567 --> 36:51.300
- Thank you for including me.
Thank you for including me.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.633
- Billie!
- It was just about social

36:52.667 --> 36:54.500
media with the hashtags and
things.

36:54.533 --> 36:56.266
Then people started--
- Hashtag trans is beautiful...

36:56.300 --> 36:57.533
- Because trans is ----ing
beautiful.

36:57.567 --> 36:59.000
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- We agree.

36:59.033 --> 37:00.500
- I didn't say,
"Hashtag transphobia."

37:00.533 --> 37:01.667
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
- Do you understand?

37:01.700 --> 37:03.467
You perpetuating
and insinuating

37:03.500 --> 37:05.734
that I'm any kind of, like,
discriminatory person,

37:05.767 --> 37:08.700
that is the grossest
extrapolation ever that I'm...

37:08.734 --> 37:10.633
- I'm coming from a place...
- Transphobic?

37:10.667 --> 37:12.467
- Where I'm a trans woman, and
you're making a girls' night

37:12.500 --> 37:14.033
and never ----ing included me.
I never once mentioned

37:14.066 --> 37:16.467
the word, so stop putting
words in my ----ing mouth.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.100
Billie, come on.
- Never.

37:18.133 --> 37:21.000
No, I did not call her
transphobic.

37:21.033 --> 37:23.000
I liked a ----ing comment.

37:23.033 --> 37:25.633
I liked 20 comments.
People that were supportive.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.667
People that were talking
about their own experience

37:27.700 --> 37:30.000
being excluded for being trans.

37:30.033 --> 37:32.500
I liked a bunch of comments.

37:32.533 --> 37:34.433
- I wish
I just wouldn't have...

37:34.467 --> 37:36.033
- An apology would have been
great from the start, but no...

37:36.066 --> 37:37.600
- Apologize to me
for perpetuating this sh--.

37:37.633 --> 37:39.567
Are you ----ing with me?
How dare you?

37:39.600 --> 37:40.734
- Then not including me
to the girls' night

37:40.767 --> 37:42.433
when I ----ing work here.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.300
You're not being
sensitive at all, not at all.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.567
- Billie, Billie, stop.
- You obviously don't get it,

37:45.600 --> 37:47.400
'cause you're
not coming from my experience.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.734
Well, enjoy your party, girl.
- It's all of our party.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.667
- No, it's not my ---
-ing party.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.300
- Okay, let's everybody--
- Cis-privilege, for sure.

37:53.333 --> 37:57.500
Cis privilege. Stop it.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.367
Cis--she's like,
"Cis privilege."

37:59.400 --> 38:01.033
- I just want her to be able
to speak about her past...

38:01.066 --> 38:02.667
- No, (BLEEP) this sh--.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.100
- so that everyone can
understand where everyone else

38:04.133 --> 38:05.367
is coming from,

38:05.400 --> 38:07.433
but nobody wants
to listen to me.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.433
- I'm sorry I didn't tag you
in my post, and all of a sudden

38:09.467 --> 38:12.400
I'm transphobic,
or I'm cis-privileged.

38:12.433 --> 38:16.166
- Cis privilege? Cis privilege?
(BLEEP) that bitch.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.066
I don't exactly know
what it means,

38:18.100 --> 38:19.600
but if it came out of
Billie's mouth,

38:19.633 --> 38:21.166
I know it's ----ed up.

38:21.200 --> 38:25.100
Cis privilege?
What the (BLEEP) is that?

38:25.133 --> 38:27.433
- Coming up...
- She pulls the fat card

38:27.467 --> 38:29.033
every day. Like...

38:29.066 --> 38:30.633
- No, no, no.
- When someone's offending her.

38:30.667 --> 38:33.100
Like, she pulls her fat card
I will pull my trans card.

38:43.433 --> 38:45.633
- Oh, my God.
It was crazy out there.

38:45.667 --> 38:48.133
They were all dancing
on the bar.

38:48.166 --> 38:51.033
- It's girls' night.
- Crazy girls night.

38:51.066 --> 38:53.200
All right,
so this night's a success,

38:53.233 --> 38:55.166
so are you going to do it
every Tuesday?

38:55.200 --> 38:56.700
- You want every Tuesday?

38:56.734 --> 38:59.133
- Well, seeing as we've got
a vacancy on Tuesdays

38:59.166 --> 39:00.667
right now, you want to do it
every Tuesday?

39:00.700 --> 39:02.533
- I mean I'll do it--
- It's a lot of work.

39:02.567 --> 39:05.133
- It's crazy. There was a line
down the street earlier.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.433
- Go and make sure it continues
to be a success.

39:07.467 --> 39:10.433
- Girls' night in blew my
expectations out of the water,

39:10.467 --> 39:13.000
and to hear Lisa say
it just confirms it all.

39:13.033 --> 39:15.133
- Hi.
- I just talked to Lisa.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.400
She was very happy
with everything.

39:17.433 --> 39:20.533
Lisa just was like, "So do you
want to do this every Tuesday?"

39:20.567 --> 39:21.667
- Wait. She said that?
- Yes.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.133
- Every Tuesday?
- Ahh!

39:23.166 --> 39:25.200
both: Good job.
- Good job.

39:25.233 --> 39:28.700
- Whoo! Yeah. I won!

39:28.734 --> 39:32.200
James is gone, bitch.
Ooh.

39:32.233 --> 39:35.567
♪ It feels so good ♪

39:37.767 --> 39:40.066
Congratulations.
You guys killed it.

39:44.734 --> 39:47.100
- Give it a little bit more.
- You don't like that?

39:47.133 --> 39:50.200
- No, wait. Here it comes.
- I can point when I...

39:50.233 --> 39:54.734
- Wait.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.433
- Right there.

39:56.467 --> 39:59.100
That one should go.
Oh, that's got to go.

39:59.133 --> 40:02.166
- It's not bad.
- That's great. Yeah.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.467
Just--yeah.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.600
Edit the sh-- out of that.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.266
- Long day.

40:22.300 --> 40:25.066
All I know is out
there is a raving success.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.533
Well, here you are.
Look at you.

40:27.567 --> 40:29.467
Sit, sit.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.600
It looks like a lot of fun
out there. Are you having fun?

40:31.633 --> 40:34.033
- Well, I just--I wasn't
included in the planning.

40:34.066 --> 40:35.700
I didn't even know
about the event,

40:35.734 --> 40:38.700
until Katie posted it,
and I wasn't tagged originally,

40:38.734 --> 40:40.700
and my feelings
are really hurt.

40:40.734 --> 40:42.533
I know I'm coming
from a trans experience...

40:42.567 --> 40:44.066
- Okay--
- Of not being included

40:44.100 --> 40:45.567
to things,
but this is a girls' night

40:45.600 --> 40:47.467
at my job,
and I wasn't included at all.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.300
- But you're here, darling.
You're here, darling.

40:49.333 --> 40:50.767
- I'm trans, and it's
"girls' night."

40:51.000 --> 40:52.734
That's my ----ing pronoun.

40:52.767 --> 40:54.767
I fought for that pronoun,
and you're not gonna invite me

40:55.000 --> 40:56.533
to a girls' night
or include me at all?

40:56.567 --> 40:58.133
She's not being sensitive,
at all.

40:58.166 --> 41:00.066
- Okay. I hear you.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.734
You've been fighting
for so long,

41:01.767 --> 41:04.767
and you've endured
so much bigotry and negativity.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.700
I hear you, but I think there's
a separate issue, darling.

41:07.734 --> 41:09.567
These are girls
that she's known for years.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.533
They just organized it
between themselves,

41:11.567 --> 41:13.667
and maybe there was some kind
of little hiccup with you

41:13.700 --> 41:16.100
that has got nothing to do
with you being transgender.

41:16.133 --> 41:20.066
I have never heard a word
come out of any of their mouths

41:20.100 --> 41:23.300
of any negativity
regarding transgender.

41:23.333 --> 41:26.100
If anything, they've got
the utmost admiration

41:26.133 --> 41:27.667
for what you've been through.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.667
I understand Billie
has had a difficult journey,

41:30.700 --> 41:33.266
but these girls
have been welcoming to her.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.200
They've been supportive of her,

41:35.233 --> 41:37.633
as have I
and all of the restaurant.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.000
- My feelings are hurt...
- Billie?

41:39.033 --> 41:40.333
- Just like her feelings
get hurt.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.033
- All I'm saying--
- She's always crying

41:42.066 --> 41:43.333
about her weight,
and I'm not allowed to talk

41:43.367 --> 41:45.000
about me being trans
and not invited

41:45.033 --> 41:47.367
to a "girls' night?" No.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.533
- They are separate issues,
Billie. Come on.

41:50.567 --> 41:53.100
- I cannot say,
"Oh, I can't be trans."

41:53.133 --> 41:55.200
She can put down the food
and do what she needs to do.

41:55.233 --> 41:57.133
- Is that--no, no.
- Her feelings are hurt,

41:57.166 --> 41:59.667
because someone calls her fat,
but my feelings can't be hurt?

41:59.700 --> 42:03.033
No. When she pulls her fat card
I will pull my trans card.

42:03.066 --> 42:04.266
- For God's sake.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.300
I'm not gonna hear
this absolute nonsense.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.734
Next time on "Vanderpump
Rules"...

42:10.767 --> 42:12.734
- You're not ----ing
better than me, Lala.

42:12.767 --> 42:14.367
You got that? You're not better
than everyone,

42:14.400 --> 42:16.233
just because you have a ----ing
rich boyfriend.

42:16.266 --> 42:18.567
You are constantly talking sh--
about people.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.667
- You're being a
----ing psychopath.

42:22.367 --> 42:27.333
all: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

42:27.367 --> 42:29.166
- Ahh!

42:29.200 --> 42:32.700
- Ariana and Lala have been out
all day drinking,

42:32.734 --> 42:34.266
and Lala goes,

42:34.300 --> 42:36.367
"Ariana, will you climb
in the back seat?

42:36.400 --> 42:37.767
I just want to eat your p----.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.400
- Oh, my God!

42:43.300 --> 42:45.100
- What's wrong?

42:45.133 --> 42:47.033
- Are you ----ing kidding me?

42:47.066 --> 42:49.567
This is my sexuality,
as a person.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.133
I don't talk about that stuff
openly with

42:52.166 --> 42:54.000
the entire ----ing world.

42:54.033 --> 42:56.367
- Today's the big reveal.
Want to see what our legacy is.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.166
- Close my eyes.
Now Open them.

42:58.200 --> 43:02.700
- What the (BLEEP)? Oh, my God.
Lisa!
