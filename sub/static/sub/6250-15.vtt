00:02.600 --> 00:06.030
Lo,the cave where the
princess doth dwell.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.890
Let the light of
Mithryleen guide our path.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.890
Smells like ass in here,yo.

00:12.900 --> 00:16.010
Yo? Who is this Yo of whom you speak?

00:16.020 --> 00:17.310
I know him not.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.800
For real,Trev. Let's go back.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.550
Those other freaks are gonna
beat us to the treasure,anyway.

00:21.590 --> 00:24.350
The name's Blackthorne,and
you'd do well to rember it.

00:24.380 --> 00:28.840
Your name is Trevor Vertuca,and
that is your mom's cell phone.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.010
Now call her to pick us up,or I will.

00:31.060 --> 00:33.280
This is getting old,right,Ezra?

00:35.930 --> 00:37.910
A rat? Come on.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.520
Wait for me! Wait for me!

00:40.530 --> 00:41.930
Look,I'm sorry about this.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.140
We don't usually break character,but...

00:44.160 --> 00:46.820
I mean,you have to dock
points; I understand.

00:52.450 --> 00:53.840
What the...

01:01.640 --> 01:02.920
Open up!

01:02.950 --> 01:07.060
All right,all right,all
right,I'm comin',it's...

01:07.100 --> 01:08.220
Just keep it down.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.510
What's taking so long?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.960
- What's wrong?
- Nothing; come on in.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.680
How about some coffee?

01:20.700 --> 01:21.970
Arabian Bean!

01:22.000 --> 01:23.120
You hurt your back again?

01:23.170 --> 01:25.950
No,no... no.

01:26.860 --> 01:28.460
It's that obvious,huh?

01:28.500 --> 01:33.060
Your gait suggests you re-strained
your anterior longitudinal ligament.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.250
Yeah,well,I blame the couch,all right?

01:35.290 --> 01:37.910
I fell asleep last
night watching the game.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.090
Look,I figured you fixed my
back last time,really well,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.010
and I just thought that
maybe you could fix it again,

01:43.050 --> 01:46.170
so use your little magic knuckles,and
hit it up,and we're good to go.

01:46.210 --> 01:49.180
Booth,if this has become a recurring
problem,you should see a specialist.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.160
Right,I get it-- all
disclaimers apply.

01:51.190 --> 01:53.950
Here we go,hit the back--
chop,chop-- we got a case.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.170
No.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.290
What do you
mean-- no?

01:56.300 --> 01:58.660
Last time I had this,you
were begging to help me.

01:58.690 --> 02:01.240
I probably shouldn't have
touched you the last time.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.710
You need a medical doctor.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.520
I'm not asking you to perform surgery;

02:04.560 --> 02:08.580
just do what you did last time,and
fix it with your magic knuckles...

02:09.060 --> 02:15.910
Look,there's no one I trust more to
get my back and crack it,than you.

02:20.460 --> 02:22.170
You want more?

02:22.180 --> 02:24.520
No,that was effective. Turn around.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.900
Okay,ready?

02:29.170 --> 02:31.470
okay. This is gonna be good.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.560
Believe me,I really am
not going to forget-- ...

02:37.020 --> 02:38.890
this.

02:39.470 --> 02:40.290
How is he?

02:40.330 --> 02:43.740
Dr. Patel suspects a herniated
disc in Booth's lumbar region.

02:43.770 --> 02:46.170
We'll know which vertebrae
when the X-rays get here.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.300
So you didn't actually paralyze him?

02:48.330 --> 02:50.530
No. The Vicodin seems to be working.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.980
He claims it makes the
furniture feel friendly.

02:54.010 --> 02:56.250
But he'll be on bed rest for
the remainder of the week.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.040
Are you okay?

02:58.060 --> 03:00.670
Of course. I wasn't
the one who was injured.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.690
Admittedly,I shouldn't have let
Booth talk me into adjusting him.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.290
- Agent Perotta.
- Dr. Brennan. Nice to see you.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.340
I was honored you requested me
as a substitute for Agent Booth.

03:11.370 --> 03:13.890
The variables involved in
breaking in a new person outweigh

03:13.900 --> 03:17.020
the benefit of possibly
finding a better investigator.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.690
Aw,let's not get gushy about it.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.850
Agent Perotta and I
inspected the dump site,

03:20.860 --> 03:23.210
and I cleared the body to be
transported back to the lab.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.820
We haven't determined identity yet.

03:24.850 --> 03:28.280
Booth usually waits for me to conduct
my own examination of the scene.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.100
Do you want to go back there?

03:30.110 --> 03:31.380
No.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.330
I'll examine the remains here,thank you.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.830
Mr. Fisher,welcome back.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.370
What are your preliminary findings?

03:40.410 --> 03:43.640
Victim is female,25 to 29 years old.

03:43.690 --> 03:47.180
Severe damage to the skull; the
mandible is almost completely severed.

03:47.220 --> 03:51.900
Avulsions to the tissue at the maxillary and
mandibular incisors-- that's very unusual.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.730
It's like her face was
hit by a wrecking ball.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.600
This damage is going to make facial
reconstruction very difficult.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.250
Yeah.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.970
Flesh is all yours,Dr. Saroyan.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.870
Does that mean we're officially
investigating a murder?

04:05.280 --> 04:08.590
She's just upset because she
put Booth in the hospital.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.460
Well,I understand that,but I still
need someone to officially say "murder."

04:12.490 --> 04:13.780
Murder.

04:13.790 --> 04:15.780
Thank you.

04:15.790 --> 04:18.810
So... what do we make of this clothing?

04:18.820 --> 04:22.470
Huh-- like a costume
out ofLord of the Rings.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.830
The porno version.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.750
Fisher,you're into this stuff.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.950
- Porn? - Fantasy.
Sci-Fi. Geek stuff.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.560
A superficial judgment.

04:30.580 --> 04:35.370
Both feet display erythema and
heavy blistering,but no calluses.

04:35.380 --> 04:38.890
My guess is,she was standing in
those princess pumps for hours.

04:38.920 --> 04:44.290
The skin here,on the back of the hand,is
less desiccated than the area surrounding it.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.100
Not sure what that means yet.

04:46.150 --> 04:47.830
May I?

04:53.330 --> 04:55.040
Hello.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.990
It's a spectroline UV stamp.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.230
They're designed to
withstand evaporation.

05:03.260 --> 05:06.660
No match to any local bars or
clubs,but I'm still searching.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.340
Agent Perotta discovered this?

05:08.360 --> 05:11.450
Yes. You should be nicer to her.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.270
Well,I like working with
Booth. I'm nice to him.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.920
Okay,I admit,I'm a geek.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.170
- You're Greek?
- No,geek,sweetie.

05:20.180 --> 05:25.550
I love it all. Star Trek,Star
Wars,Buffy,Xena,Akira.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.540
I even watchFringe.

05:27.570 --> 05:32.100
My girlfriend Jill dumped me
because of it,which is depressing.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.480
Fisher,what doesn't depress you?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.060
Answers.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.340
I know that insignia.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.290
I bet the victim was a
booth babe at ImagiCon.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.370
I don't know what that means.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.520
ImagiCon?

05:43.550 --> 05:49.230
It's a convention for fans of genre
movies,comic books,video games,anime.

05:49.270 --> 05:51.830
And it's at Union Center
till the end of the week.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.760
Click on "gallery" for
Booth Babe Roundup. Yeah.

05:54.770 --> 05:58.220
When Dr. Saroyan talked about the
victim standing on her feet for hours,

05:58.230 --> 06:00.040
sort of started to click for me.

06:00.050 --> 06:01.790
Stop.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.990
That's definitely our dress.

06:04.030 --> 06:08.730
And judging from her zygomatic
arches and facial contours,

06:08.770 --> 06:11.150
there's a good chance
that's our victim wearing it.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.190
Someone should inform Agent Perotta.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.130
That'd be you,sweetie.

06:15.650 --> 06:19.860
Of course. I will inform Agent Perotta.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.320
These people don't look like killers.

06:29.690 --> 06:33.190
I... disagree.

07:09.190 --> 07:13.810
Fascinating. A summit between the
disenfranchised and the commercial franchises.

07:13.820 --> 07:17.590
I'm at a loss for an
anthropological analogue.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.110
So you really did a number
on Booth's lower back,huh?

07:20.140 --> 07:23.820
He had a mechanical problem which
didn't show up on his X-rays.

07:23.850 --> 07:26.690
My adjustment aggravated

07:27.020 --> 07:28.490
So,it was an accident.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.610
Yes. Why? Did Booth tell
you something different?

07:31.210 --> 07:36.500
No,no,no. In fact,"aggravated"
was,um,exactly the word he used.

07:36.780 --> 07:39.370
Oh,there's the Grimoire 3. 0 booth.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:48.670 --> 07:50.800
I'm Special Agent Perotta,FBI.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.340
This is Dr. Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

07:53.370 --> 07:56.000
We need you to answer
a couple of questions.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.080
Yeah,that's Kendra Kim.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.030
- You can call me Shiny.
- Why?

08:01.040 --> 08:03.550
It's my name. Shiny Kopinsky.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.560
Shiny,you didn't find it strange at
all that Kendra didn't show up for work?

08:07.590 --> 08:10.750
I just figured the Grimoire
people fired her,for her attitude.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.470
What are Grimoire people?

08:12.510 --> 08:17.200
Grimoire 3. 0 is the online encyclopedia
fantastica for the mouth breather crowd.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.740
Your job is to sexualize software?

08:19.780 --> 08:21.530
You mentioned Kendra had an attitude.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.750
Kendra thought she was a princess.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.760
She kept bragging about the fact
that this was her last trade show

08:26.810 --> 08:29.780
and she was sitting on some gold
mine,and it was gonna cash in big.

08:29.830 --> 08:30.900
What was the gold mine?

08:30.940 --> 08:32.460
She wouldn't say.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.799
But one day,I followed
her on a lunch break.

08:34.850 --> 08:37.510
I figured I'd catch her
talking to some game developer.

08:37.559 --> 08:41.049
I mean,those guys are loaded,and
some of them even smell normal.

08:41.100 --> 08:45.780
But the only person I saw her talking to
was some loser at the Blacksmith booth.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.440
Are you Kroon the Blacksmith?

08:52.470 --> 08:54.070
Kroon,I am.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.650
And who be ye,fair maiden?

08:55.690 --> 08:59.950
I be a special agent in
search of justice and truth.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.660
Yea,thou art.

09:01.700 --> 09:02.660
How can I assist thee?

09:02.690 --> 09:05.140
By knocking off the medieval
stuff and answering some questions.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.170
That would make me
feel more comfortable.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.180
I assume "Kroon the Blacksmith"
is not on your driver's license.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.480
The name's Peter Kroon.

09:11.520 --> 09:15.470
I don't know what you've heard,but these
weapons are all legal and accounted for.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.000
Do you know this young woman?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.690
I know her first name. Kimba.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.560
- Kendra.
- Whatever.

09:20.570 --> 09:21.850
She's the girl with Excalibur.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.340
You mean the sword from
the King Arthur mythos?

09:24.350 --> 09:28.620
Yes. Though in this case,it's a prop
sword from the filmLe Morte d'Arthur.

09:28.630 --> 09:29.770
Is she in trouble?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.880
No. She's dead.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.890
Do you sell nunchaku?

09:33.920 --> 09:35.450
No. No.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.740
Why do you ask if she's in trouble?

09:37.780 --> 09:40.500
Uh,she stopped by and asked me
how much I'd give her for it.

09:40.530 --> 09:41.930
Excalibur.

09:41.970 --> 09:46.290
I take a look,and go,"Whoa,that
ain't no ordinary cutlery."

09:46.340 --> 09:48.300
I have to wonder if it's hot.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.680
You know,stolen.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.230
Did it have significant value?

09:51.260 --> 09:54.100
It was worth thousands.
Tens of thousands.

09:54.110 --> 09:56.670
You weren't tempted to kill
her,take it for yourself?

09:56.710 --> 10:00.660
Look,I could've told her it was worth two
hundred bucks,ripped her off,but I didn't.

10:00.690 --> 10:03.090
I sent her to Carl Derf
to list it at the auction.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.810
Why was this piece of
cutlery worth so much?

10:05.850 --> 10:11.920
It was the actual prop wielded by Guy
Thivisol in the first fantasy film ever made!

10:11.970 --> 10:17.110
The Excalibur from this film is the
holy grail of fantasy memorabilia.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.090
Here it is. Beautiful.

10:21.510 --> 10:24.590
And you have no idea
where Kendra Kim got it?

10:24.630 --> 10:26.820
She said she got it from her family.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.910
You don't believe her?

10:27.940 --> 10:31.340
That sword hasn't been seen in 20 years.

10:31.370 --> 10:34.970
What I thought was that she
got it from someone else here.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.140
Stole it?

10:36.180 --> 10:38.050
Stole it,maybe.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.240
The girl was hot.

10:40.590 --> 10:43.640
That goes a long way
in a place like this.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.170
Trauma is limited to the skull.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.550
Once I clean the skeleton and get a better
look at the mandibular damage,I'll know more.

10:54.590 --> 10:56.520
Or get fired for incompetence.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.060
Well,I am finished with the soft
tissue,so you can remove the flesh now.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.430
According to our old friends
Diptera and Coleoptera,

11:02.440 --> 11:05.330
I'd place actual time of
death about 72 hours ago.

11:05.370 --> 11:09.600
Also,I discovered soil under her
nails,along with traces of Virginia nailwort.

11:09.630 --> 11:11.580
Neither native to the dump site.

11:13.910 --> 11:16.300
What's with the long
face there,sunshine?

11:16.340 --> 11:19.770
Mr. Fisher just broke up with his
girlfriend,and he's feeling a little down.

11:19.790 --> 11:23.360
What about me? My girlfriend and I broke
up,I gotta see her at work every day.

11:23.370 --> 11:26.950
Well,obviously,it hasn't blackened
your soul like it has mine.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.780
There was some light charring.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.070
I'm dead inside.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.370
Okay,you win. Happy?

11:33.670 --> 11:36.170
Not that I can ever remember.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.560
So,what did your doctor say?

11:42.610 --> 11:49.070
Something about a possible herniation
occurred on my disks L-3,L-4.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.730
Nothing,you know,a
little rest stretching...

11:51.760 --> 11:54.600
Hey,maybe a good massage
will just kick it right out.

11:54.650 --> 11:58.000
Intervertebral disk degeneration
shouldn't be taken lightly.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.340
Are you wearing your
lumbo-sacral support belt?

12:00.380 --> 12:04.240
Yeah,a girdle,you mean.
Yes,it's nice and tight.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.170
Oh,hold on.

12:07.510 --> 12:08.220
It's Booth.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.920
Hey,it's Perotta. How you
doing? Uh,you need anything?

12:11.930 --> 12:14.710
No. I am just dandy.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.150
Well,if you do,um...

12:17.550 --> 12:19.180
Hey,we found the victim's father.

12:19.220 --> 12:21.130
- We did?
- Who's that?

12:21.140 --> 12:23.830
- It's Booth.
- No,no,no,before it was you.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.300
Booth,you pressed "conference."

12:25.340 --> 12:27.110
- Dr. Brennan?
- It's me Booth.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.110
Booth is on painkillers. Is
the victim's father coming in?

12:30.120 --> 12:32.130
- I want to be there.
- No,you can't.He can't

12:33.420 --> 12:35.460
- Why?
- Yes,I can.

12:35.470 --> 12:37.380
What are you still doing on this call?

12:37.410 --> 12:40.050
No,Agent Perotta,his back is very bad.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.650
He can't be there. You can't let him in.

12:43.150 --> 12:45.650
Yes,I can. I am the ranking officer.

12:45.660 --> 12:48.210
But you are incapacitated
by painkillers.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.680
Bones,enough,okay? I'm not
incapacapitated,whatever you said there,all right?

12:51.690 --> 12:54.640
I just... Don't listen
to her,Perotta. Don't.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.770
Did you daughter live
at home with you,Mr. Kim?

13:00.320 --> 13:01.980
No.

13:02.010 --> 13:04.680
Kendra lived in a condo in Logan Circle.

13:04.730 --> 13:07.590
Look,ask him when was the
last time he saw his daughter.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.690
What was that?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.590
- This is Agent,um,Booth.
- Hello?

13:11.600 --> 13:15.350
He's unable to be with us in person.

13:15.370 --> 13:20.520
Kendra and I didn't see each other much,despite
the fact that I put a roof over her head.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.340
According to the modeling
agency that booked your daughter,

13:22.390 --> 13:24.650
all of her checks were
sent to your address.

13:24.690 --> 13:28.230
The money went to pay the mortgage
on the condo,which is also in my name.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.680
It's kind of a weird
arrangement,now isn't it?

13:30.720 --> 13:31.820
So's this.

13:31.850 --> 13:36.540
Well,considering my situation
and my back,just... continue.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.010
Kendra was about as irresponsible
as a person could be.

13:42.060 --> 13:46.870
I told her,after she paid her debt to
me,she could spend her money how she wanted.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.080
Tough love.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.740
Did you give her a sword?

13:51.780 --> 13:52.580
A sword?

13:52.620 --> 13:55.000
It's a knife,but it's only huge.

13:55.030 --> 13:55.770
No.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.190
But did you daughter mention that
she might have something of value?

13:58.230 --> 13:58.790
No.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.450
Probably because you'd
take it away from her.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.700
- Okay,this doesn't work.
- Don't shut me off!

14:06.660 --> 14:10.020
I'd like to take a look at
your daughter's condo,Mr. Kim.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.530
Looks like someone
really wanted that sword.

14:38.330 --> 14:41.380
Precise slashes to the couch and
removal of ventilation screens

14:41.390 --> 14:43.790
suggests purpose
frustrated in the search.

14:43.830 --> 14:46.840
Digital answering machine
behind the bed. It's cracked.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.490
See if Computer Forensics
can get anything off of it.

14:49.530 --> 14:51.270
Found some running shoes in the closet.

14:51.310 --> 14:53.600
Soles contain insects,soil and blood.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.250
You want our lab to
analyze that or yours?

14:55.280 --> 14:58.370
Yeah,I'd like to see you try
and get these away from me now.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.190
Figuratively speaking,of course.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.890
Anything else,Dr. Hodgins?

15:02.930 --> 15:05.590
In some ways,you're just like Booth.

15:05.610 --> 15:07.050
Mean that as a compliment.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.170
I don't think you do.

15:11.380 --> 15:12.260
Now,check this out.

15:12.300 --> 15:15.620
Mandibular trauma
downward,maxillary trauma upward.

15:15.650 --> 15:18.300
Trauma to the molars
extends bilaterally.

15:18.350 --> 15:22.030
The force radiated symmetrically
from the center of her mouth.

15:22.070 --> 15:23.590
It's like her face exploded.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.170
Certainly nothing I've seen before.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.240
Very good,Mr. Fisher.

15:29.270 --> 15:31.070
Really?

15:31.500 --> 15:37.040
Just seems like the truth is further away
than it was before and like laughing at us.

15:37.300 --> 15:41.150
Process of elimination is a key
step to discovering the truth.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.160
I've seen many unusual murder weapons.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.810
So the fact that I don't recognize
this one,rules out all the others.

15:49.930 --> 15:52.330
My kind of silver ling.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.170
It's depressing.

15:59.680 --> 16:03.230
The blood I found on the Booth
babe's running shoes-- not human.

16:03.260 --> 16:06.060
I think our princess kissed a toad.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.480
Bufo Americanus. American toad.

16:09.490 --> 16:10.850
So she stepped on a frog?

16:10.890 --> 16:12.910
A toad. Bufo Americanus.

16:12.920 --> 16:17.390
Which amphibian is down to
one local population right here

16:17.400 --> 16:22.940
near the Potomac in an area which matches the
soil and the flora found beneath her fingernails.

16:22.980 --> 16:26.580
She went for a run,stepped on
a frog,and buried something.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.360
A toad,and yeah,yeah,that's the
picture forming in my mind,too.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.940
We pulled this message off
the victim's answering machine.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.900
I don't know who you think
we're fooling,little princess,

16:36.940 --> 16:39.640
but you're playing with a
woman who gets what she wants.

16:39.670 --> 16:43.590
You've got three days.
I want that sword.

16:44.710 --> 16:47.280
You want me to do a profile from
a voice on an answering machine?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.780
Give it a shot. You're a smarty-pants.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.500
Okay,fine.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.680
"You're playing with a woman."

16:52.730 --> 16:56.290
That suggests that the caller regards
the victim as a child in comparison.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.240
Okay,so,so what,an old woman?

16:58.270 --> 17:00.310
No,no,experientially.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.280
Probably in terms of sexual experience.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.069
So you're looking for
someone fairly promiscuous.

17:05.109 --> 17:07.890
I think that she's already tried
to take the sword from a man,

17:07.930 --> 17:11.579
and now is truly annoyed that
she has to deal with a girl.

17:12.050 --> 17:18.440
The auctioneer is a man,and he evaluated the
sword before Kendra panicked and buried it.

17:21.550 --> 17:24.829
I can assure you that this
is a clean and fair auction.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.490
We've been running this
auction for 15 years.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.700
Please answer the question,Mr. Dorf.

17:28.730 --> 17:29.670
"Derf."

17:29.710 --> 17:32.060
Yes,I certified and registered the item.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.640
I even gave the consigner an option to
store it in our secure room. She declined.

17:35.650 --> 17:38.840
Consigner has to give you
detailed contact information,right?

17:38.870 --> 17:39.790
They want to get paid.

17:39.830 --> 17:44.780
And sometimes you give that information to
certain parties interested in illegal pre-bidding?

17:44.790 --> 17:47.590
What? No,no. Look,I told you before...

17:47.600 --> 17:49.000
Your pupils are constricted,

17:49.010 --> 17:51.240
- suggesting an increase in adrenaline.
- What?

17:51.250 --> 17:56.160
And the change in voice pitch indicates increased
pressure in the neck via the laryngeal prominence.

17:56.170 --> 17:58.540
- What,what are you saying?
- You're lying to us.

17:58.550 --> 18:01.740
Kinesthesia is a clear indicator
of dissembling,Mr. Dorf.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.420
"Derf." But look...

18:04.430 --> 18:05.900
Do you recognize this voice?

18:05.930 --> 18:07.830
I don't know who you think
you're fooling,little princess,

18:07.870 --> 18:10.590
but you're playing with a
woman who gets what she wants.

18:10.620 --> 18:14.160
You've got three days.
I want that sword.

18:14.170 --> 18:16.200
Did that woman contact
you about the sword?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.810
Yes,she did.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.320
Her name is Valerie Daniels.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.300
She's a medieval weapons collector.

18:21.330 --> 18:25.030
And you provided her with Kendra
Kim's address and phone number.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.310
Every auction does private
pre-bids,and no one ever gets...

18:28.320 --> 18:30.840
- Hurt?
- What? Wait a minute.

18:30.850 --> 18:34.230
What about the Excalibur? Did you find
it? Is it still going up for auction?

18:34.240 --> 18:37.910
Booth is right. You're
like a portable polygraph.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.620
He didn't mean that in
a good way,though,did he?

18:45.310 --> 18:49.530
This is quite a collection of medieval
and fantasy weapons,Miss Daniels.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.440
My parents call it a waste of my trust
fund,which is praise enough for me.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.560
Seems like an unlikely
hobby for a young woman.

18:56.590 --> 18:58.130
I like sharp edges.

18:58.170 --> 19:02.000
I like sharp against soft.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.750
- What do you like,Dr. Sweets?
- What?

19:05.020 --> 19:07.180
Can you account for your
whereabouts Wednesday night?

19:07.190 --> 19:09.740
Yeah. I was somewhere
not killing Kendra Kim.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.010
That's what you wanted to know,right?

19:11.050 --> 19:12.130
It's not what I asked.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.610
I was at the Immortal
Comics after-party.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.620
You can ask Dean Noveck,the publisher.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.810
We slept together. The sex was vanilla.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.600
At least I got an alibi out of it,right?

19:21.640 --> 19:24.430
You feel a need to be in
control,don't you,Miss Daniels?

19:24.470 --> 19:26.890
I'd like to control
you if you're up for it.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.710
Oh,I assure you I'm not.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.570
And your attempt to regain
self-esteem through sexual intimidation

19:32.610 --> 19:36.530
will not repair the dysfunctional
relationship you had with your father.

19:36.580 --> 19:40.210
Abandonment,abuse,indifference.

19:40.250 --> 19:46.630
You are far more ripped under those schoolboy
duds than one would think,aren't you,Dr. Sweets?

19:46.940 --> 19:49.790
Yes,but right now,I'm
more interested to hear

19:49.800 --> 19:53.280
why you trashed Kendra's condo
after you didn't kill her.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.090
Her condo was trashed?

19:55.110 --> 19:58.880
They were looking for Excalibur.
That's what you wanted,right?

19:59.210 --> 20:03.410
I travel the world tracking
down rare and beautiful weapons.

20:03.440 --> 20:07.430
I do research,I develop
contacts,I put in serious work.

20:07.460 --> 20:12.290
Along comes this Booth babe with a famous
sword thought to be lost for decades.

20:12.740 --> 20:13.940
She didn't deserve it.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.980
But you deserved it.

20:15.010 --> 20:16.530
I asked her where did she get it.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.780
She said somebody dressed as a black knight
just gave it to her on the first day of ImagiCon.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.900
Just walked up and presented
it to her as a gift.

20:24.930 --> 20:27.530
She expected me to believe that?

20:28.300 --> 20:33.500
I didn't kill the girl.
I just wanted the sword.

20:39.090 --> 20:41.260
- Oh,man,feels good.
- Yeah.

20:41.270 --> 20:42.480
Thanks for coming along.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.390
Yeah,any chance to get some fresh air.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.370
Lone guy with a metal detector in
the bushes-- looks kind of creepy.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.670
It is. And I know you.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.900
Oh,boy! Frog!

20:53.910 --> 20:57.480
Toad,not frog. Bufo Americanus.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.390
And Virginia nailwort.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.230
We're close to where
she buried the sword.

21:02.270 --> 21:04.310
Hold on a second.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.370
I got frequency response.

21:17.330 --> 21:19.670
Excalibur.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.920
I am the
once-and-future king.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.860
Way to not be creepy.

21:36.710 --> 21:39.140
That is not a toy,Dr. Hodgins.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.880
It kind of is. It's a movie prop.

21:40.910 --> 21:42.240
Stainless steel blade.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.220
That was new technology for the time.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.490
Edge is dull,of course.

21:45.530 --> 21:46.960
May I see?

21:49.780 --> 21:52.690
It's badly balanced.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.620
The blade is warped.

21:54.660 --> 21:58.180
All of the prints on the
sword belong to Kendra Kim.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.250
Could this be the murder weapon?

21:59.270 --> 22:01.240
She wasn't stabbed or slashed.

22:01.290 --> 22:02.520
The damage to her jaw is unique.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.510
It wasn't from being
struck with a sword.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.250
Is that the sword?

22:06.300 --> 22:08.010
Can I?

22:11.420 --> 22:14.140
An elegant weapon for
a more civilized age.

22:14.170 --> 22:19.420
Actually,the age in which swords were the primary
infantry weapon were some of the most barbaric in history.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.930
It's a line fromStar Wars.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.090
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

22:22.130 --> 22:23.910
What language is that supposed to be?

22:23.940 --> 22:25.280
Why is he all excited?

22:25.310 --> 22:29.390
Finding this sword has given us
a unique advantage in this case.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.480
We now have what the
killer wants the most.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.750
It only makes sense that the
killer's gonna come after it again.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.690
Dr. Sweets wants to lay a trap.

22:35.710 --> 22:38.390
You said that the auctioneer
is no longer a suspect,correct?

22:38.450 --> 22:40.380
So we lean on him to fake the auction?

22:40.420 --> 22:43.170
We can't auction off evidence.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.730
I never thought of that.

22:44.780 --> 22:50.080
We could insert an undercover asset who outbids
everyone for the item no matter how high the price goes.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.040
The auction's tomorrow.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.870
I don't have time to set
up that kind of operation.

22:52.910 --> 22:53.840
I'll do it.

22:53.880 --> 22:58.510
You and Dr. Brennan have already been seen
walking around ImagiCon asking questions,right?

22:58.550 --> 23:01.870
Whereas I am an unknown quantity.

23:01.910 --> 23:02.910
An enigma.

23:02.940 --> 23:06.790
Who is this man bidding so
aggressively for Excalibur?

23:06.820 --> 23:11.860
I'm confident that if our killer is
there,this will provoke him to reveal himself.

23:11.900 --> 23:17.670
I play the mystery bidder,you observe the unsuspecting
suspects via video feed in a separate room.

23:17.710 --> 23:19.680
Who's gonna run the camera?

23:20.570 --> 23:23.730
We need someone who blends in.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.640
Someone who looks
like they belong there.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.220
I drug your ghost across the country

23:28.240 --> 23:31.270
And we plotted out
my death in every city

23:31.310 --> 23:32.970
Memories would whisper,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.100
"Here is where you rest," ah.

23:37.490 --> 23:39.580
What's wrong now?

23:44.160 --> 23:46.600
Sold to the Rancor princess.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.240
Congratulations,ma'am.

23:48.290 --> 23:51.870
Is there a special reason why
you wanted me here,Agent Perotta?

23:51.910 --> 23:54.870
I- I thought you wanted to be
involved in the investigation.

23:54.890 --> 23:56.260
Uh,um,okay.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.820
Pan around,Fisher.

23:57.860 --> 23:58.900
We have an Imperial...

23:58.940 --> 23:59.900
Good.

23:59.930 --> 24:02.890
There is Peter Kroon.

24:02.910 --> 24:04.530
Bidding starts at...

24:04.570 --> 24:06.470
And there is Valerie Daniels.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.100
Let's hope she doesn't recognize Sweets.

24:09.130 --> 24:10.800
Oh,there's the Black Knight.

24:10.830 --> 24:14.150
Valerie Daniels said that a Black
Knight gave Kendra the sword.

24:14.180 --> 24:16.090
All right,stay on this one,Fisher.

24:16.110 --> 24:18.280
Okay,lot 922.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.810
We have here the Geiger counter,

24:20.830 --> 24:25.200
the actual Geiger counter used by
Ron Berger inThe Day of the Atom.

24:25.220 --> 24:29.100
Who can forget that sound right
before the giant cockroach attack?

24:29.120 --> 24:31.790
Click-click-click-click-click-
click-click-click-click!

24:31.810 --> 24:33.930
Bidding starts at $10,000.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.390
Do I have ten?

24:35.430 --> 24:37.460
Ten to the Elven Warrior!

24:37.480 --> 24:40.210
15 to the Snaarflap in the front row.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.740
Do I have 16?

24:41.770 --> 24:42.930
Sixteen?

24:42.960 --> 24:44.070
$20,000!

24:44.090 --> 24:46.070
Going once,twice.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.990
Sold to the gentleman Molnar!

24:48.020 --> 24:49.440
Uh,sorry,ma'am.

24:49.470 --> 24:51.470
Female Molnar.

24:51.870 --> 24:52.840
Okay,here we go.

24:52.870 --> 24:53.670
Sword is next.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.890
Uh,Fisher,find Sweets.

24:55.930 --> 25:01.480
Sweets,you got to try to keep that giant fuzzy
thing between you and Valerie Daniels,okay?

25:01.510 --> 25:02.670
She won't recognize me.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.830
Where did he get that
disguise on such short notice?

25:04.860 --> 25:07.130
My guess is his closet.

25:07.150 --> 25:09.710
Our last item needs no introduction:

25:09.750 --> 25:15.250
The Excalibur sword from
the filmLe Morte d'Arthur.

25:16.740 --> 25:20.360
As you may have heard,the seller of
this item tragically died this week.

25:20.390 --> 25:24.160
According to her family's wishes,the
proceeds from this lot will go to charity.

25:24.180 --> 25:31.140
Due to the rare nature of this
item,bidding will start at $50,000.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.460
This will separate
the men from the boys.

25:35.510 --> 25:36.880
Or the women!

25:36.920 --> 25:39.090
$50,000 to the lady in black.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.510
Do I hear 55?

25:40.560 --> 25:41.770
Sixty?

25:41.810 --> 25:44.700
60 to the gentleman from
the future with the red lips.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.240
Do I hear 70?

25:46.290 --> 25:48.120
$70,000,yes!

25:48.160 --> 25:49.340
Do I hear 80?

25:49.370 --> 25:50.410
$80,000!

25:50.450 --> 25:51.520
Do I hear 90?

25:51.560 --> 25:52.730
We have 80 on the table.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.640
Do I hear...

25:53.670 --> 25:56.060
One hundred and fifty.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.160
Fisher,let take a look at this guy.

25:59.210 --> 26:01.830
$150,000.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.830
Going once,twice...

26:03.870 --> 26:04.930
One hundred sixty!

26:04.970 --> 26:06.370
One hundred and seventy!

26:06.420 --> 26:07.600
Two?

26:07.650 --> 26:10.920
$200,000!

26:13.690 --> 26:14.680
Who is that guy?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.020
Who is that guy?

26:16.060 --> 26:19.250
This was Johnny Gerard's
first ever fantasy film.

26:19.290 --> 26:21.180
$300,000!

26:21.250 --> 26:23.060
Sir?

26:23.800 --> 26:26.690
$400,000!

26:26.820 --> 26:29.490
$400,000!

26:29.520 --> 26:34.800
In 193 A.D.,the Praetorian Guard took over Rome and
auctioned off the entire empire to the highest bidder.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.420
I don't know why I'm nervous,but I am.

26:36.450 --> 26:38.790
Sweets,it's fake money. Okay?

26:38.820 --> 26:39.530
Just do it.

26:39.570 --> 26:40.240
twice...

26:40.280 --> 26:40.910
Do it!

26:40.950 --> 26:41.780
Five hundred!

26:41.830 --> 26:44.600
$500,000 for the Excalibur sword.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.790
A half a million dollars.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.730
Sir?

26:51.270 --> 26:53.450
Ma'am?

26:54.450 --> 26:57.530
$500,000 going once...

26:58.580 --> 27:00.890
twice...

27:01.620 --> 27:05.870
Sold to the skinny
gentleman dressed as a...

27:05.900 --> 27:07.530
Congratulations,sir.

27:07.550 --> 27:09.680
And thank you,everyone.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.620
Join us at the medieval weapons
demonstration in the exhibit hall.

27:14.270 --> 27:16.040
How you doing?

27:17.210 --> 27:20.570
Just making a documentary.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.920
Well,I am gonna go talk to James Bond.

27:28.290 --> 27:30.110
Nice suit.

27:30.130 --> 27:32.100
Got a minute?

27:34.650 --> 27:36.870
Badgley Mormont?

27:36.910 --> 27:37.850
Is that your real name?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.010
Of course it's my real name.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.470
It's a family name.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.100
Could I possibly get my passport back?

27:42.130 --> 27:43.270
You in a big hurry to get somewhere?

27:43.300 --> 27:45.480
I need to make a flight,yes.

27:45.490 --> 27:46.940
What's your business with the sword?

27:46.970 --> 27:50.610
I represent a group of collectors
known as the Arthurian Consortium.

27:50.640 --> 27:54.660
We house the world's largest collection
of materials relating to Camelot.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.700
They wanted the sword.

27:57.270 --> 27:58.750
That was actually pretty wild.

27:58.790 --> 28:01.250
But I'm pretty sure no one
realized the auction was bogus.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.100
The auction was fixed?

28:03.120 --> 28:06.690
I'm going to sue you,and
I'm going to sue you.

28:14.650 --> 28:19.580
You know,intellectually,I knew the auction
was fixed,but,man,my heart was pumping.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.580
Well,technically,your
adrenal glands were secreting.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.280
Okay,remember last session when
we talked about the correcting

28:25.320 --> 28:27.750
and how it could be read the wrong way?

28:27.790 --> 28:28.920
Right.

28:29.750 --> 28:34.620
So...how did it feel
when you won the sword?

28:34.630 --> 28:35.310
Awesome!

28:35.340 --> 28:36.700
Thank you for asking.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.720
Though I got to say,I'll be
glad to be back behind my desk.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.300
I had enough excitement to last me...

29:08.130 --> 29:10.020
Stop!

29:35.690 --> 29:37.870
Sweets,are you hurt?

29:37.980 --> 29:40.390
I- I don't know. I don't know.

29:42.540 --> 29:43.900
Mad props.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.860
Thanks.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.230
You okay?

29:53.350 --> 29:54.930
Okay,you know what?

29:54.960 --> 29:55.980
I'm coming in. All right?

29:56.010 --> 29:56.930
You could've been killed.

29:56.950 --> 29:58.310
No,you shouldn't move,Booth.

29:58.370 --> 30:02.260
With a herniated disc,the splintered
cartilage can irritate the nerves and...

30:02.290 --> 30:03.070
I'm fine.

30:03.110 --> 30:05.150
So the-the pain is gone?

30:05.190 --> 30:07.050
Don't feel a thing.

30:07.070 --> 30:13.330
I might not be moving as
fast,but,hey,still haven't lost my edge.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.260
So why wasn't Perotta with you?

30:15.280 --> 30:16.770
I was with Sweets.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.040
That's like being protected by a Smurf.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.990
Not the sheriff,the
guy who was in charge.

30:22.020 --> 30:25.530
I don't even know his name,but
he was blue,small guy...

30:25.550 --> 30:27.700
Booth have you taken more Vicodin?

30:27.760 --> 30:30.090
Look,Booth,I'm fine. Sweets is fine.

30:30.130 --> 30:32.620
A little shaken up,but
really,we're both fine.

30:32.650 --> 30:33.950
Please don't come in.

30:33.970 --> 30:35.780
If you think so.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.030
But I'm ready.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.260
That's amazing in your condition.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.170
Well,you know me.

30:42.210 --> 30:45.850
I really think you should just
take your Vicodin and rest.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.940
All right.Okay.

30:47.970 --> 30:49.270
Let me talk to Perotta.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.140
All right.

30:50.170 --> 30:52.250
He wants to talk to you.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.240
How are you,Agent Booth?

30:57.260 --> 31:00.660
The only reason that I'm not coming in
right now is because Bones told me not to.

31:00.700 --> 31:02.550
But she is your responsibility.

31:02.590 --> 31:03.970
Nothing can happen to her,okay?

31:03.990 --> 31:11.820
If anything happens to her,you
know,that silky black hair and...

31:12.150 --> 31:13.950
that soft skin...

31:13.970 --> 31:15.760
I will not let her out of my sight.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.140
You have my word.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.950
Now,uh,we should really get
back to the case,Agent Booth.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.030
Am I stopping you?

31:27.070 --> 31:29.250
Let me in.

31:31.020 --> 31:35.630
All right,I'm gonna go,uh,round up as
many Black Knights as I can at ImagiCon.

31:35.670 --> 31:38.450
In the meantime,please don't
go out in the field without me.

31:38.490 --> 31:39.520
I don't need a sitter.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.560
Booth gets needlessly
protective sometimes.

31:41.590 --> 31:43.470
I have no idea why.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.550
You really don't,do you?

31:45.570 --> 31:46.990
No.

31:47.110 --> 31:49.730
Just call me. Please.

31:53.030 --> 31:55.710
Matched paint chips that
we lifted from Sweets's car.

31:55.750 --> 31:59.000
Copolymer comprised of
ethylenically unsaturated monomers

31:59.040 --> 32:02.320
containg hydroxyl groups
and other vinyl monomers.

32:02.350 --> 32:04.230
You know,they could
have been killed,Hodgins.

32:04.260 --> 32:05.560
Sweets is way too young for this.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.500
He still has to show his ID to drink.

32:07.530 --> 32:08.680
But they weren't.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.160
And Brennan...

32:10.460 --> 32:12.630
she shouldn't be putting
herself in danger like this.

32:12.650 --> 32:16.460
Angela,she cares too much to keep it all in
the lab,and you're never gonna change her.

32:16.480 --> 32:20.330
Why can't she just get her rocks off
through sex like a normal person,right?

32:20.370 --> 32:21.340
I agree.

32:21.390 --> 32:27.020
And in the spirit of
friendship,if,you know,you ever...

32:28.510 --> 32:31.020
Saved by the beep,huh?

32:32.210 --> 32:35.330
The paint is from an
early '90s Ford Explorer.

32:35.370 --> 32:39.450
Now,all Perotta has to do is find
an evil Black Knight that owns one.

32:43.700 --> 32:47.950
There's blood on the blade,so you
landed some hits on the errant Knight.

32:47.980 --> 32:48.980
He Can you pull DNA?

32:49.020 --> 32:50.920
Sure,but we have
nothing to compare it to.

32:50.950 --> 32:52.540
There are some fresh nicks on the blade.

32:52.570 --> 32:55.310
Only metal would damage
the blade like this.

32:55.350 --> 32:56.380
Was he wearing armor?

32:56.420 --> 32:58.640
No. His movement wasn't
constricted at all.

32:58.670 --> 32:59.920
He jangles.

32:59.950 --> 33:00.790
Sweets.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.620
How are you feeling?

33:01.670 --> 33:03.880
Appreciative of the air bag.

33:03.910 --> 33:06.120
Um,doctor says I'm fine,thanks.

33:06.150 --> 33:06.970
Jangled.

33:07.000 --> 33:07.780
Yeah.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.200
A lot of change in his pocket?

33:09.240 --> 33:12.010
I wasn't particularly observant
because during the attack,

33:12.050 --> 33:15.150
I secreted copious
quantities of adrenaline.

33:15.180 --> 33:18.220
An attack is an acceptable
excuse,Dr. Brennan.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.760
I'll have Hodgs examine the
sword,and see what he can find.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.590
Okay.

33:21.620 --> 33:26.020
Uh,hey,I have to thank you,Dr.
Brennan,for saving my life.

33:26.060 --> 33:27.230
I owe you a great deal.

33:27.250 --> 33:33.180
I'm sure you would have done the same for
me,Dr. Sweets,if I had been trapped in the car.

33:33.210 --> 33:37.280
Yeah. Though I have to say,you were
quite impressive with that sword.

33:37.310 --> 33:40.500
Your moves--
very Xena-ish.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.250
Xena-ish?

33:41.290 --> 33:47.570
Xena-- she's a tall warrior
princess who is really...a fantasy.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.940
Okay,thank you,I...think.

33:49.980 --> 33:53.530
Oh,uh,hey,since we shared this
brush with death,Dr. Brennan,

33:53.550 --> 33:57.780
I was wondering if I could also call you
"Bones" in future moments of shared camaraderie?

33:57.790 --> 33:59.380
Don't call me "Bones."

33:59.420 --> 34:01.030
Sure about that,Bones?

34:01.060 --> 34:03.170
Please,don't.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.230
None of them drives a Ford
Explorer,and they all have alibis.

34:06.260 --> 34:08.469
Four that can be
corroborated by their moms.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.290
Any way for you to get blood samples?

34:10.320 --> 34:10.830
No.

34:10.860 --> 34:14.980
Me dressing like a medieval knight isn't
exactly enough to get a warrant to collect DNA.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.060
Maybe you could get the names of a few
more Black Knights from these Black Knights?

34:19.210 --> 34:20.670
Okay.

34:20.699 --> 34:25.570
But I gotta tell
you,being addressed as****

34:27.670 --> 34:30.110
***

34:33.170 --> 34:34.440
Mr. Fisher!

34:34.480 --> 34:36.230
This is the murder weapon.

34:36.270 --> 34:38.540
Not the literal murder
weapon-- I'm not that good--

34:38.570 --> 34:41.400
but it certainly falls
within the genre or type.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.500
What is it?

34:42.550 --> 34:45.600
The Pear of Anguish,a
medieval torture device.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.310
Valerie had it.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.639
Valerie...

34:48.690 --> 34:49.780
Valerie Daniels.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.659
One of the suspects in
the case Valerie Daniels?

34:52.679 --> 34:53.730
How did you get it?

34:53.760 --> 34:56.150
Oh,do we really have to get into that?

34:56.179 --> 34:58.040
Now we do,yeah.

34:58.070 --> 34:59.760
Our eyes met at the auction.

34:59.800 --> 35:03.700
We shared a bleak and
profound hopelessness.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.630
You spent the night with a suspect?

35:05.650 --> 35:07.180
Yes.

35:07.210 --> 35:10.270
Valerie enjoys quite a
collection of torture devices,

35:10.290 --> 35:14.710
and other archaic implements used
for pleasure rather than pain.

35:15.120 --> 35:15.810
May I?

35:15.850 --> 35:16.970
Sure.

35:18.480 --> 35:23.820
This particular Pear of Anguish is to be
inserted in either the vagina or the anus.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.080
There are larger ones for the mouth.

35:26.110 --> 35:30.850
As it is opened,it expands the hard
palate and mandible in equal proportion,

35:30.890 --> 35:33.020
which would give exactly these injuries.

35:33.060 --> 35:35.500
Crushing the maxilla and zygomatic...

35:35.550 --> 35:40.630
thrusting the bones into
the brain,killing the victim.

35:40.740 --> 35:42.720
That is one horrible way to die.

35:42.750 --> 35:46.550
I wish the depravity and cruelty
of human behavior surprised me.

35:46.590 --> 35:48.230
Does that extend to disciplinary action?

35:48.260 --> 35:50.970
'Cause you are in big
trouble,my melancholy friend.

35:51.010 --> 35:52.550
Of course I am.

35:52.580 --> 35:56.170
Who could expect a
night of love to last?

36:06.930 --> 36:09.250
***sword

36:09.290 --> 36:10.590
can ****

36:10.640 --> 36:12.940
*****

36:12.970 --> 36:14.960
"I hereby tender my resignation."

36:14.990 --> 36:18.770
Practically speaking,this sword
is not worth enough to kill for.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.410
If any thing is worth killing for,then
everything is worth killing for.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.850
It's worth so much because
it appeared in the movie.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.320
That's conveyed value.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.880
Intrinsically it can't be worth
more than a few hundred dollars.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.980
You mean if it really was a sword from
100 AD,you'd understand killing for it?

36:34.020 --> 36:34.830
Yes,I would.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.270
I'd like very much to
examine a sword like that.

36:38.310 --> 36:39.830
What about the marks on this sword?

36:39.860 --> 36:40.600
Metal.

36:40.620 --> 36:41.360
You struck metal.

36:41.390 --> 36:42.280
You said he was a knight.

36:42.310 --> 36:43.930
Chain mail.

36:44.740 --> 36:46.770
I'm thinking chain mail.

36:48.700 --> 36:49.270
What?

36:49.300 --> 36:52.340
The knight who attacked me
was authentic in his moves.

36:52.370 --> 36:56.070
He used two attack maneuvers:
the serpent and the arrowhead.

36:56.110 --> 36:57.680
Could've learned them from movies.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.210
Movies never show combatants
holding the sword correctly,

37:01.230 --> 37:04.420
which is one hand on the handle
and the other on the blade.

37:04.470 --> 37:07.170
Our assailant's form was
historically accurate.

37:07.210 --> 37:12.100
So,uh,you believe you were attacked
by an actual Arthurian Knight?

37:12.130 --> 37:13.210
No.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.690
Time travel is
scientifically impossible.

37:15.710 --> 37:20.650
But I was attacked by someone well-trained
in archaic martial arts,wearing chain mail.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.440
oing to need to use your
metal detector again.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.650
Sure.

37:25.290 --> 37:27.600
I think she means that
you should go with her.

37:27.630 --> 37:29.180
Oh,yeah,right.

37:29.220 --> 37:31.660
Hey,field trip.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.090
What's that?

37:43.270 --> 37:44.790
Part of Sweets's car.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.470
Think he wants it back?

37:46.500 --> 37:48.110
I'll ask him.

37:48.230 --> 37:50.670
So what am I looking for exactly?

37:50.700 --> 37:52.880
Maybe the Black Knight
dropped his metal wallet?

37:52.910 --> 37:57.270
No. Historically,that would be a leather
sack held together with flax thread.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.880
It wouldn't register
on your metal detector.

37:59.910 --> 38:00.990
I hit him hard.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.860
Perhaps hard enough to dislodge...

38:03.890 --> 38:08.120
some of his chain mail.

38:12.370 --> 38:15.390
What we're looking at is
flat riveted chain mail.

38:15.430 --> 38:16.450
Is it real?

38:16.490 --> 38:19.520
If by "real," you mean does
it come from medieval times?

38:19.580 --> 38:20.680
No,no.

38:20.730 --> 38:23.150
But it's a very,very good replica.

38:23.180 --> 38:24.760
Made of wrought iron.

38:24.790 --> 38:27.850
It's alternating rows of
solid rings and riveted rings.

38:27.890 --> 38:31.460
Historically accurate,but the smelting
methods for the wrought iron are modern.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.750
Can you trace the manufacturer?

38:32.790 --> 38:34.730
I had Fisher do it.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.270
Hodgins,are you trying to help someone?

38:39.320 --> 38:40.930
Because that's not in your character.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.720
The way I see it,Fisher's
like a deep cover agent.

38:43.770 --> 38:46.370
He infiltrated the
enemy to uncover secrets.

38:46.400 --> 38:51.500
In order to do so,he had to suffer a night of
passion with a beautiful but dangerous enemy.

38:51.550 --> 38:53.900
You have no idea how dangerous.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.970
He's sort of my hero.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.460
All right,what have you got?

38:58.490 --> 38:59.860
I didn't have to go far.

38:59.890 --> 39:04.170
There are only three manufacturers
working at this level with these materials.

39:04.190 --> 39:09.400
Can I please keep my job if I promise
never ever to have sex again with anyone,

39:09.430 --> 39:12.740
which,by the way,suits
me temperamentally?

39:12.760 --> 39:15.570
I happen to be very self-sufficient.

39:15.590 --> 39:19.300
I won't require that,Mr.
Fisher,but I do require discretion.

39:19.340 --> 39:22.990
Nothing will pass these
lips again,Dr. Saroyan.

39:23.020 --> 39:28.960
Even if a scary,hot woman in black
leather uses the Pear of Anguish on me.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.060
Which I'm actually afraid she will.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.840
Kroon the Blacksmith.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.080
You started out as a
serious historian at Yale.

39:45.120 --> 39:49.660
You studied medieval warfare and
Chaucerian literature at Oxford.

39:49.690 --> 39:50.760
You're a published poet.

39:50.780 --> 39:55.420
You're wondering how a man with all my potential
ended up selling artifacts to fantasy geeks?

39:55.450 --> 39:56.690
No,I don't care.

39:56.740 --> 40:00.570
Your car shows you are the person who drove
Dr. Brennan and Dr. Sweets off the road.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.430
Your wound matches the one Dr.
Brennan delivered to her assailant.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.900
It was your blood on the sword,and
we found fragments of your chain mail.

40:06.940 --> 40:07.750
We know you did it.

40:07.780 --> 40:08.720
We just don't know why.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.260
But we really don't care why.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.400
Well,I kind of do.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.060
The motive thing,it's pretty
central to a conviction.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.220
I know why he did it.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.600
Read this to him.

40:18.790 --> 40:21.190
"What is a man without his love?

40:21.210 --> 40:24.550
"What is a man without his love?

40:24.580 --> 40:30.560
"If Love turn its back on thee
"it is as a hearth with no fire."

40:30.590 --> 40:35.740
'Tis best to slay the false heart
"to waken from the dream that is life

40:35.760 --> 40:40.500
than live dark hearted in a dark world."

40:42.220 --> 40:43.410
What's that?

40:43.430 --> 40:44.970
It's mine.

40:45.030 --> 40:46.790
I wrote that.

40:46.810 --> 40:47.800
It's a confession.

40:47.830 --> 40:49.970
It's a confession.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.550
I loved her.

40:52.980 --> 40:55.280
Stupid,but...

40:55.800 --> 40:58.600
love is stupid,you know.

40:58.630 --> 41:02.160
You gave her the sword,your
most valuable possession.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.200
And she tried to sell it for rent.

41:04.220 --> 41:07.540
You killed her because she
wanted to sell a movie prop?

41:07.560 --> 41:10.080
You don't understand.

41:10.670 --> 41:14.450
No one understands true love anymore.

41:24.610 --> 41:27.110
So he killed her because
he loved her so much?

41:27.130 --> 41:30.960
The whole Age of
Chivalry was irrational.

41:30.990 --> 41:38.180
