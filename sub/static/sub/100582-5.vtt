RICHARD LEWIS:
Jonah was adamant about
having a kickass car chase.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.136
I tried in my conservative
logistic sense to pair it down,

59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.806
and every time I did, he went,
"Nope. Jack it back up."

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:04.059
We shoot a grenade
and it comes back

1:00:04.142 --> 1:00:05.227
and blows up a car.

1:00:05.936 --> 1:00:09.231
CG explodes. We did
a practical version of it,

1:00:09.481 --> 1:00:12.150
and we wound up doing
a CG takeover of that.

1:00:12.651 --> 1:00:14.486

Really nice piece that we made.
It was wonderful.

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:30.418
LISA JOY: Episode 305,
it's an idea that Jonah

1:00:30.502 --> 1:00:32.003
had been kicking around
for the longest time.

1:00:32.087 --> 1:00:35.841
He wanted to play with genre,
and we had a way into it

1:00:35.924 --> 1:00:37.217
with the limbic system.

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:40.679
JONATHAN NOLAN: Cognition,
meta‐cognition, human emotion.

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:43.849
We already manipulate them with
different classes of drugs

1:00:43.932 --> 1:00:45.851
that push one chemical up,
push it down.

1:00:45.934 --> 1:00:47.894
You think about
psychopharmacology now,

1:00:48.103 --> 1:00:51.064
the limbic implant
is our all‐purpose idea

1:00:51.147 --> 1:00:54.025
for how you eliminate
and entire branch of medicine

1:00:54.192 --> 1:00:55.193
and replace it digitally.

1:00:55.777 --> 1:00:58.405
You take a piece of digital
medicine that essentially,

1:00:58.488 --> 1:01:00.198
it's a license,
it's not even a chemical.

1:01:00.532 --> 1:01:02.450
What made sense to us about that
was that

1:01:02.534 --> 1:01:05.745
it would be prescribable,
it would be a physical thing.

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:09.749
JOY: Brilliant Aaron Paul
really having fun

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:13.169
with the experimental style
on a Gonzo road trip

1:01:13.253 --> 1:01:16.214
through hell while spinning out
on drugs.

1:01:17.090 --> 1:01:19.175
The craziest drug trip
of your life.

1:01:19.259 --> 1:01:23.179
From horror to suspense
to action to romance.

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:26.558
That was a lot of fun to shoot.

1:01:26.725 --> 1:01:30.353
The whole episode
was just so insane.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:37.777
JOY: Casting Vincent Cassel
was a no brainer.

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:39.237
I actually remember on the phone

1:01:39.321 --> 1:01:41.072
talking to him
about the character.

1:01:41.489 --> 1:01:43.450
He's intelligent,
he's beguiling,

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:44.951
he's charismatic,
and he's powerful.

1:01:45.410 --> 1:01:48.413
And he said, "I can see why
you wanted to cast me."

1:01:49.623 --> 1:01:53.335
He has a magnetism to him
as a performer

1:01:53.418 --> 1:01:57.172
and an intelligence that
you really wanted in this role.

1:01:57.422 --> 1:02:00.342
Almost godlike in his
understanding of the world.

1:02:01.092 --> 1:02:03.720
VINCENT CASSEL:
People will really have a vision
of what could happen

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:06.306
with the world and how they can
make it better.

1:02:06.765 --> 1:02:10.018
I've listened to those people
speaking about their ideas

1:02:10.101 --> 1:02:11.853
and trying to figure out
what kind of character

1:02:11.937 --> 1:02:14.272
because you cannot be too snob

1:02:14.773 --> 1:02:16.316
even though
you're out of society,

1:02:16.399 --> 1:02:18.652
but you still think
for the people.

1:02:19.361 --> 1:02:20.779
Engerraund Serac.

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:23.657
He knows everything about
all the datas of the world,

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.867
and he knows how
to centralize all that.

1:02:25.951 --> 1:02:28.161
That's how he wants to control
the world.

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:32.582
We're going to open their cages.

1:02:33.625 --> 1:02:36.962
EVAN RACHEL WOOD:
When I realized
what Dolores's plan was,

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:40.882
I thought this is the greatest
act of anarchy

1:02:40.966 --> 1:02:43.301
that I think I've ever seen
on television.

1:02:43.802 --> 1:02:47.472
Everyone can see their entire
life is playing out exactly

1:02:47.555 --> 1:02:49.057
the way the system
has set it up.

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:52.143
And it feels like all of
their choices have been a lie.

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:56.648
And I think that's a moment
where we don't know

1:02:56.731 --> 1:02:58.233
exactly how to feel
about Dolores.

1:02:58.316 --> 1:02:59.693
There's a lot of things
that she does

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:00.944
where we're
constantly questioning

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:03.279
is she the good guy
or the bad guy?

1:03:03.488 --> 1:03:06.825
It's that question of well,
"What does a revolution
really look like?"

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.037
And, "What has to happen
for us all to be free?"

1:03:11.121 --> 1:03:12.455
I think these are
all the questions

1:03:12.539 --> 1:03:14.457
that we're gonna be constantly
asking ourselves

1:03:14.541 --> 1:03:15.875
when we watch this season.
