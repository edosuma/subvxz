"The shrieking madness
of char-gar gothakon:

00:05.022 --> 00:07.424
The beast that hath no name"?

00:07.492 --> 00:09.392
You're actually reading this?

00:09.459 --> 00:10.960
The Professor is a great writer.

00:11.027 --> 00:12.961
His stuff is spooky.

00:13.028 --> 00:14.562
Hatecraft is a total fake.

00:14.630 --> 00:15.964
He says he's just writing...

00:16.030 --> 00:17.798
what demons from dark
dimensions tell him.

00:17.866 --> 00:19.032
Please!

00:19.100 --> 00:20.801
How do you know they're not true?

00:20.869 --> 00:22.301
Um, because I have a brain?

00:22.369 --> 00:24.537
Wait until Harlan Ellison
speaks here next week.

00:24.605 --> 00:25.871
He's a real writer.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.306
He'll set you bozos
straight about hatecraft.

00:28.374 --> 00:29.541
Later.

00:29.609 --> 00:33.644
"Char-gar gothakon:
The beast that hath no name."

00:33.712 --> 00:35.645
How can Professor hatecraft
name the creature in the title,

00:35.713 --> 00:37.480
then say it has no name.

00:37.548 --> 00:39.047
Ridiculous.

00:41.551 --> 00:43.985
Ohh! What is that smell?

00:59.532 --> 01:02.466
Uhh! Aah!

01:02.534 --> 01:04.268
Hello!

01:06.003 --> 01:08.204

Now, daph, chin up.

01:55.274 --> 01:57.975
Spending some time away from
your little mystery club...

01:58.043 --> 01:59.944
will do you some good.

02:00.011 --> 02:02.145
Stop by the building we paid for,

02:02.213 --> 02:03.646
and if you see any professors,

02:03.714 --> 02:05.181
remind them your sisters...

02:05.249 --> 02:07.449
all graduated from
darrow university...

02:07.517 --> 02:09.418
by the time they were 13.

02:09.485 --> 02:11.686
I'm only visiting this school
because you want me to, mom.

02:11.753 --> 02:13.721
What if darrow isn't for me?

02:13.789 --> 02:15.889
A college good enough for
the other Blake girls...

02:15.957 --> 02:17.624
isn't good enough for you?

02:17.692 --> 02:19.592
Ha ha ha! Oh, Daphne,

02:19.659 --> 02:22.495
sometimes I wish we
would have had a boy.

02:23.896 --> 02:25.964
Fred, go straight to
my old fraternity...

02:26.031 --> 02:27.332
and drop my name.

02:27.399 --> 02:28.799
They have to let you in,

02:28.867 --> 02:31.101
no matter how much
you talk about traps.

02:31.169 --> 02:33.970
Man, it feels weird being
here without the gang.

02:34.037 --> 02:35.471
Things sure have
been pretty rough...

02:35.539 --> 02:36.905
since shaggy and velma broke up.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.940
By grabthar's hammer, Fred,

02:39.008 --> 02:41.342
the Rogers kid chose
a dog over a girl.

02:41.409 --> 02:44.144
What's he thinking?
This isn't some reality show.

02:44.212 --> 02:45.912
Now, I dreamed of the day...

02:45.980 --> 02:48.615
you'd be humiliated
by my fraternity.

02:48.682 --> 02:49.982
Don't blow this for me.

02:50.049 --> 02:52.818
I can't believe I'm
here the same day...

02:52.886 --> 02:54.085
as my favorite author.

02:54.152 --> 02:55.419
Do you think Harlan Ellison...

02:55.487 --> 02:57.355
will sign all my
copies of his books?

02:57.422 --> 02:59.289
I knew Harlan back in the day.

02:59.357 --> 03:02.392
Just tell him Cape
Cod dinkley sent you.

03:02.460 --> 03:05.127
He'll sign.

03:05.195 --> 03:08.129
But, like, the best thing
about darrow university...

03:08.197 --> 03:10.431
is the burger place on campus.

03:10.499 --> 03:12.633
They're known everywhere
for their burgers.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.102
And the French fries,
onion rings, and shakes.

03:16.436 --> 03:18.337
Try not to embarrass us, please.

03:18.405 --> 03:22.440
Better yet, just don't
tell them your last name.

03:58.169 --> 03:59.102
Mu gamma tau.

03:59.170 --> 04:00.436
Mu are you?

04:00.504 --> 04:02.772
Um, hi. I'm Fred Jones Jr.

04:02.839 --> 04:06.041
My dad was a mu gamma toe...
tau... uh, toe.

04:06.108 --> 04:08.509
Fred! I'm rhino.

04:11.179 --> 04:13.212
Guys, this is Fred Jones Jr.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.915
His dad was mu legend...
Fred Jones.

04:15.983 --> 04:16.915
What?!

04:16.983 --> 04:18.716
I thought Fred Jones was a myth.

04:18.785 --> 04:20.752
I heard he ate a live bear.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.287
So, uh, what do you guys do here,

04:23.355 --> 04:25.689
study? Party? Make traps?

04:25.756 --> 04:27.857
Amateur hour.
When you're in college,

04:27.925 --> 04:31.360
male, and ripped,
there's only one thing to do.

04:31.428 --> 04:32.628
Wrestle!

04:33.863 --> 04:35.897
Go get him, Randy!

04:41.436 --> 04:46.138
The Blake family center
for self-named buildings.

04:46.206 --> 04:48.206
Hmm.

04:52.110 --> 04:55.045
No longer will they
ignore your people!

04:55.113 --> 04:56.646
Are you with me?!

04:56.714 --> 04:58.314
Fight! Fight! Fight!

04:58.382 --> 05:00.315
Are you with me?!

05:00.383 --> 05:02.551
Uh...Yes?

05:02.619 --> 05:05.052
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight...

05:05.120 --> 05:06.487
What are we fighting?

05:08.890 --> 05:10.290
There it is, scoob!

05:10.358 --> 05:12.859
I can already taste the legends.

05:12.927 --> 05:16.962
Burgers, fries, onion rings!

05:17.997 --> 05:20.331
Wow! We're really here.

05:20.399 --> 05:24.801
Ahem. Uh, bring us, like,
your most famous food, please.

05:24.869 --> 05:27.403
It's the way I always dreamed it.

05:28.739 --> 05:31.506
It's the way I've
always smelled it.

05:31.574 --> 05:33.742
Ahh.

05:41.048 --> 05:43.016
Eew!

05:43.083 --> 05:44.683
These aren't burgers.

05:44.751 --> 05:46.218
We changed management last week.

05:46.285 --> 05:47.919
Now we're organic vegan.

05:47.987 --> 05:51.756
Those are pureed sprouts
and wheat gluten.

05:53.157 --> 05:54.324
Yuck!

05:54.392 --> 05:55.759
Ucchh!

05:56.594 --> 05:58.060
And that's why...

05:58.128 --> 06:00.129
there hasn't been
anything good written...

06:00.196 --> 06:02.797
since the 1970s.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.067
Thank you.

06:07.135 --> 06:10.136
Ok, questions.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.271
My name is Howard e. Roberts,

06:12.339 --> 06:14.472
and my favorite writer
is one of our professors,

06:14.540 --> 06:16.808
and I was wondering if you
could compare your work...

06:16.876 --> 06:19.910
to his masterpiece, "the shrieking
madness of char-gar gotha... "...

06:19.978 --> 06:22.479
You mean h.P. Hatecraft?

06:22.547 --> 06:24.514
An intesting scribbler, yes,

06:24.581 --> 06:25.515
no doubt.

06:25.582 --> 06:26.416
But minor.

06:26.483 --> 06:27.983
And that's being kind.

06:28.051 --> 06:29.217
That's not true.

06:29.285 --> 06:30.652
He's a brilliant writer...

06:30.720 --> 06:33.087
who understands the dark
creatures of other dimensions.

06:33.155 --> 06:35.790
I perceive in you, young sir,

06:35.857 --> 06:37.323
one who hears nothing...

06:37.391 --> 06:38.825
but the sound of the win...

06:38.893 --> 06:40.427
blowing across the empty desert...

06:40.494 --> 06:42.394
that lies between your ears.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.532
Hatecraft is, at best,

06:47.599 --> 06:50.067
a literary fraud, a con man.

06:50.134 --> 06:54.537
At worst, a dirt smear in
the diaper of literature.

07:04.979 --> 07:06.413
Mr. Ellison?

07:06.481 --> 07:10.016
Yes, dear. I can only
sign so fast, you know.

07:10.084 --> 07:10.983
Velma dinkley, sir.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.417
I'm a huge fan of your work,

07:12.485 --> 07:13.552
and the themes you explore in...

07:13.619 --> 07:15.686
Dinkley? Not by
any happy chance...

07:15.754 --> 07:18.923
a relation to Cape Cod dinkley,
an old friend of mine?

07:18.990 --> 07:19.923
My mother.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.391
Oh, holy bradbury.

07:21.459 --> 07:24.027
You must give her a kiss for me.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.761
And thank her for the chicken soup.

07:25.829 --> 07:27.262
Jinkies! I will!

07:27.330 --> 07:29.530
It was great meeting you.
Thanks so much.

07:29.598 --> 07:30.698
My pleasure.

07:30.766 --> 07:32.033
Oh, by the way,

07:32.101 --> 07:35.135
jinkies is not actually a word.

07:42.475 --> 07:45.110
Hatecraft this, hatecraft that...

07:45.177 --> 07:48.045
Perhaps someone could ask me
about my own latest work...

07:48.113 --> 07:50.180
once in a while.

07:54.776 --> 07:56.476
Uhh...Uhh!

08:02.767 --> 08:03.667
Aah!

08:04.120 --> 08:06.453
It sounds like
someone's in trouble.

08:06.521 --> 08:08.487
- Help!
- Huh?

08:08.555 --> 08:12.954
Help! Somebody please help me,
already! Help!

08:13.022 --> 08:15.456
Uhh! Uhh! Aah! Aah!

08:15.524 --> 08:16.423
Aah!

08:16.490 --> 08:18.389
I've changed my mind!

08:18.457 --> 08:21.457
Maybe that food's is not so bad!

08:30.994 --> 08:31.959
Mr. Ellison, are you ok?

08:32.027 --> 08:34.394
Ok?! I've been violated...

08:34.462 --> 08:37.693
by a figment of a fantasist's
fabricated falsehood...

08:37.761 --> 08:40.395
for the sole function
of fame and fortune.

08:40.462 --> 08:43.696
Oh, like, that is
a lot of fa..Fa...

08:43.764 --> 08:45.130
Really?

08:45.198 --> 08:47.130
Is it "like" that?

08:47.198 --> 08:48.597
What if, like, like...

08:48.665 --> 08:51.832
were used in, like,
its proper grammatical form...

08:51.900 --> 08:54.399
and not, like,
as a conversational pause,

08:54.467 --> 08:56.633
like every third, like, word?

08:56.700 --> 08:58.801
Boy, what got him so upset?

08:58.868 --> 09:01.401
Maybe he wouldn't be
so mad if he saw this.

09:01.469 --> 09:03.234
A copy of hatecraft's book,

09:03.302 --> 09:06.069
"char-gar gothakon:
The beast that hath no name."

09:06.136 --> 09:07.736
Someone's read this a lot.

09:07.804 --> 09:09.804
There's all kinds of
sentences underlined.

09:10.971 --> 09:13.237
Ucch. And it smells
like old clam chowder...

09:13.305 --> 09:14.971
being gargled by a seal.

09:15.039 --> 09:18.572
But why would a monster carry a
book about himself around with him?

09:18.640 --> 09:22.073
I want to meet this Professor
hatecraft for myself.

09:35.511 --> 09:36.811
Professor hatecraft?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.578
Professor hatecraft?

09:39.645 --> 09:42.578
Hello? Professor hatecraft?

09:42.646 --> 09:44.279
Your door was open.

09:56.850 --> 09:59.249
With all these books,
you'd think this guy...

09:59.317 --> 10:02.484
could, like, afford a maid.

10:05.485 --> 10:08.185
Ohh! Ohh...

10:10.253 --> 10:12.753
It's just a statue, beef brains,

10:12.821 --> 10:16.387
of a character from another
one of hatecraft's books.

10:28.092 --> 10:30.524
Breaking news. This just in.

10:30.592 --> 10:32.025
Campus police say
they have no leads...

10:32.093 --> 10:34.125
on today's theft of the
darrow family archives...

10:34.193 --> 10:35.692
from the university library.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.059
Professor hatecraft?

10:38.127 --> 10:41.060
Ooh! By the tendrils
of shap-shap sumagurath,

10:41.128 --> 10:42.027
you frightened me.

10:42.095 --> 10:43.294
We're sorry, Professor.

10:43.361 --> 10:45.994
We're big fans who
wanted to meet you.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.829
Well, now's not a good time.

10:47.896 --> 10:50.563
It's like the wrath of
fung fard hargenflog...

10:50.630 --> 10:52.097
has descended upon me.

10:52.164 --> 10:55.630
I hope I haven't released
char-gar gothakon on the world.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.198
What do you mean?

10:57.265 --> 11:01.165
My work... translating the
demon-summoning chants...

11:01.233 --> 11:03.100
written in these evil tomes,

11:03.167 --> 11:05.467
which my student assistant
alphabetizes for me.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.534
You think, like,
everything you're writing...

11:07.602 --> 11:09.034
is actually happening?

11:09.102 --> 11:12.335
Dark forces are at
work in this very home,

11:12.403 --> 11:14.869
and I fear I may have
inadvertently opened a portal...

11:14.937 --> 11:16.203
to an alternate dimension.

11:16.270 --> 11:17.870
That's bad, right?

11:17.938 --> 11:21.171
Stop! You might accidentally
unleash another demon.

11:21.238 --> 11:23.405
Oh. That's just fan mail.
Never mind.

11:23.473 --> 11:26.772
A lot of these seem to be
in the same handwriting.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.406
My fans are very dedicated.

11:28.474 --> 11:31.474
Now, if you will excuse me,

11:31.541 --> 11:33.607
I sense messages...

11:33.675 --> 11:37.275
from another universe coming on.

11:38.643 --> 11:40.943
Well, what do you say, gang?

11:41.010 --> 11:44.777
Do we stay together and keep
working to solve this mystery?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.980
Is that a no?

12:10.751 --> 12:12.151
What are you doing here?

12:12.219 --> 12:13.518
This place is vegan.

12:13.586 --> 12:15.285
There's nowhere else to eat...

12:15.353 --> 12:16.586
for, like, miles.

12:16.653 --> 12:20.986
Yeah. We're so hungry,
we'd even eat vegetables.

12:21.054 --> 12:22.420
Whoa...Ooh!

12:23.821 --> 12:26.988
Sorry. My friends were wrestling.

12:30.790 --> 12:33.223
My new brothers are
gonna teach me a move...

12:33.290 --> 12:34.623
called happy tapioca.

12:34.691 --> 12:37.124
I don't know what it is,
but apparently, uh,

12:37.191 --> 12:39.525
I'll be blindfolded and
submerged into pudding.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.092
See ya around.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.126
Ha ha! Yeah!

12:43.193 --> 12:45.292
I can't wait to get
you out of here.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.826
Hey, good job.

12:52.829 --> 12:54.761
Ahem.

13:03.198 --> 13:04.464
Blehh!

13:04.532 --> 13:07.532
You said it, scoob.
Please pass the salt.

13:11.868 --> 13:13.567
Aah!

13:13.634 --> 13:16.068
Char-gar gothakon!

13:16.136 --> 13:17.268
Aah...

13:17.336 --> 13:19.002
Like, run!

13:19.870 --> 13:21.902
Aah!

13:24.004 --> 13:27.138
Aah! Just because I'm
letting you save me...

13:27.204 --> 13:28.438
doesn't mean I forgive you.

13:28.505 --> 13:30.771
Tapioca! Tapioca!

13:30.839 --> 13:32.405
So, what construct of the man...

13:32.473 --> 13:34.272
are we going to go
after next, Ernesto?

13:34.340 --> 13:35.939
Don't worry, comrade Daphne,

13:36.007 --> 13:38.273
our true calling will
present itself soon.

13:38.341 --> 13:41.040
In the meantime, pick something
from the list of protestables.

13:41.108 --> 13:42.107
It's fun.

13:42.175 --> 13:44.675
Rice crackers, schwarma,

13:44.743 --> 13:45.842
old person smell?

13:45.910 --> 13:47.209
Can you even protest that?

13:47.277 --> 13:49.910
I don't know, but someone should.

13:54.879 --> 13:55.911
Ohh!

13:55.979 --> 13:57.912
Professor hatecraft,
you have to run!

13:57.980 --> 14:00.646
Char-gar gothakon is
at the campus burger!

14:00.714 --> 14:02.913
Wait. Were you spying on us?

14:02.981 --> 14:05.213
Yes. I wanted to see if you
were telling the truth,

14:05.281 --> 14:08.081
and by the talons of
feng shui nabiscus,

14:08.149 --> 14:10.415
you were! I have no choice now...

14:10.483 --> 14:12.415
but to reveal the terrible,
dark truth...

14:12.483 --> 14:13.916
about char-gar gothakon.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.651
I know you've heard the rumors...

14:21.719 --> 14:23.485
of a sighting on
campus last night...

14:23.553 --> 14:25.119
of a monster from one of my novels,

14:25.187 --> 14:27.419
but I want to set
the record straight.

14:27.487 --> 14:30.754
My writings, as Mr. Ellison
said the other day,

14:30.821 --> 14:32.420
are a fraud.

14:32.488 --> 14:35.288
There is no char-gar gothakon.

14:35.356 --> 14:37.422
I made the whole thing up.

14:37.490 --> 14:39.089
It can't be true!

14:39.157 --> 14:42.223
Who is forcing you to lie like this,
Professor hatecraft?

14:42.291 --> 14:44.557
This is not a lie.
I am telling the truth.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.591
I perpetuated the
myth to sell books...

14:47.659 --> 14:51.026
and to gain access to the lucrative
world of plushy monster toys.

14:51.094 --> 14:52.360
I am so sorry.

14:52.427 --> 14:53.560
Ignore him!

14:53.628 --> 14:55.193
We are the ones telling the truth!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.027
Monsters deserve equality.

14:57.095 --> 14:59.895
Char-gar gothakon
should not be silenced.

14:59.962 --> 15:02.128
And here's a song to tell you why.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.266
now what do we do? No one's
listening to a word we say.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.333
There's only one tng we can do...

15:19.401 --> 15:21.267
Build a trap.

15:21.334 --> 15:23.434
And I can't do it alone.

15:27.702 --> 15:28.969
what's going on?

15:29.037 --> 15:31.136
Ohh!

15:32.638 --> 15:34.437
Uh, I think we made our point.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.738
The protest is over. Aah!

15:40.139 --> 15:41.839
So what do you say, gang?

15:41.907 --> 15:43.740
Are we gonna solve
this mystery or not?

15:45.651 --> 15:48.186
Aah!

15:50.156 --> 15:52.684
Aah!

15:52.685 --> 15:54.619
Somebody save me!

16:06.523 --> 16:09.021
Professor hatecraft?

16:09.089 --> 16:12.553
Ooh! Help!

16:13.920 --> 16:16.451
We'll never find him
if we don't split up.

16:16.519 --> 16:19.784
Ok. I guess that
means we go... huh?

16:20.785 --> 16:22.416
Oh, come on.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.981
Wow! I can't wait to be an adult.

16:27.049 --> 16:28.647
You can have so much cool stuff...

16:28.715 --> 16:30.980
that has that awesome
old person smell.

16:31.048 --> 16:32.645
Here. You might need
this for the trap.

16:32.713 --> 16:33.846
Great find, daph.

16:33.913 --> 16:35.978
Hey, you know, we make a
pretty good team, don't we?

16:36.046 --> 16:38.477
Uh-huh. It's like we
know each other's thoughts.

16:38.544 --> 16:41.043
Yeah! Hey, guess what
I'm thinking now.

16:41.110 --> 16:44.108
Well, are you thinking about me?

16:44.176 --> 16:47.407
Ha! Gotcha! I'm not
thinking about anything.

16:47.475 --> 16:49.407
My mind is a complete void.

16:49.474 --> 16:51.306
Good try, though.

16:51.373 --> 16:52.972
Thanks.

17:01.436 --> 17:03.468
I thought shaggy was
right behind us.

17:03.535 --> 17:05.067
Huh? You worried?

17:05.135 --> 17:06.433
Oh, who am I kidding?

17:06.501 --> 17:08.400
It's like he's a part of me.

17:08.468 --> 17:12.199
Even though he left me for you.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.230
I'm sorry.

17:15.298 --> 17:18.296
Scooby! Velma! Help!

17:18.363 --> 17:19.862
It's shaggy!

17:25.328 --> 17:27.226
Something jumped off
the shelf at me...

17:27.294 --> 17:29.492
and had, like, a tentacle.

17:31.559 --> 17:32.924
It's not a tentacle.

17:32.991 --> 17:36.823
It's a strap for
someone's book bag.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.189
They look like stories.

17:39.256 --> 17:40.755
Listen to this title.

17:40.823 --> 17:42.687
"The dreaded beast goo-goo gaga."

17:42.755 --> 17:44.686
Eew! Yuck!

17:44.754 --> 17:46.553
They've got that same smell.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.819
It's like a baboon
smoking a cigar...

17:48.886 --> 17:50.451
while bathing in a
bath of moldy tuna...

17:50.518 --> 17:52.017
and curdled ranch dressing.

17:52.084 --> 17:54.616
Hey! Let me out!

18:00.549 --> 18:02.313
Aah!

18:02.381 --> 18:03.580
Thank goodness!

18:03.647 --> 18:06.212
Trapped inside with all of
hatecraft's lousy books,

18:06.280 --> 18:08.777
it's like being in his
version of the underworld.

18:08.845 --> 18:10.277
Who put you in here?

18:10.344 --> 18:11.676
The guy with all the tentacles.

18:11.744 --> 18:12.776
What's his name?

18:12.844 --> 18:14.975
Char-gar gothakon!

18:15.043 --> 18:17.074
Stay away, you demon!

18:17.142 --> 18:18.574
The Professor!

18:26.306 --> 18:28.904
Help! Help me!

18:31.637 --> 18:32.769
Help!

18:35.669 --> 18:37.034
Help me! Aah!

18:37.102 --> 18:38.801
We've got to distract it.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.266
Hatecraft's monsters are
only summoned by chanting.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.266
Follow me.

18:45.399 --> 18:47.097
Whoa! Aah!

18:47.165 --> 18:49.596
Char-gar gothakon...

18:53.363 --> 18:55.227
Char-gar gothakon...

18:55.295 --> 18:57.959
Don't chant at it, hit it!

18:58.027 --> 18:59.026
Uhh!

19:01.626 --> 19:02.858
Ohh!

19:02.926 --> 19:05.924
Aah!

19:08.124 --> 19:10.256
Help!

19:10.323 --> 19:11.888
Aah!

19:17.187 --> 19:20.185
Like, you don't hear many
monsters from other dimensions...

19:20.253 --> 19:22.251
scream for help.

19:23.718 --> 19:25.116
This is no monster.

19:25.184 --> 19:26.450
It's Howard e. Roberts,

19:26.518 --> 19:29.449
hatecraft's student
assistant and biggest fan.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.148
Just as I suspected.

19:31.215 --> 19:32.680
Suspected how?

19:32.748 --> 19:35.346
Think about it. We found a
book written by hatecraft,

19:35.414 --> 19:39.078
with sentences underlined that
smelled like char-gar gothakon.

19:39.146 --> 19:40.477
Of course it was me.

19:40.545 --> 19:43.277
Someone had to defend the
Professor against his critics.

19:43.345 --> 19:46.243
And what better way than to
dress as his greatest creation?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.841
Fortunately, I'd taken a class...

19:47.909 --> 19:49.841
in the military application
of sonic shriek technology...

19:49.909 --> 19:51.307
at the learning annex.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.973
Although, in retrospect,
it might not have been a good idea...

19:54.040 --> 19:56.738
to glue real octopus
legs to my face.

19:56.806 --> 19:59.505
Ah, so that was the smell!

19:59.571 --> 20:02.103
But when hatecraft
admitted he made it up?

20:02.171 --> 20:03.836
That's when he had to fall.

20:03.904 --> 20:05.269
And he would have, too,

20:05.337 --> 20:07.301
if it weren't for the
dark elder forces...

20:07.369 --> 20:11.333
conspiring in the inky
black of time most foul!

20:11.401 --> 20:14.365
Oh. And you meddling kids.

20:20.197 --> 20:22.230
H.P., are you all right?

20:22.297 --> 20:26.161
Harlan. Yes. Just an overeager
fan who got carried away.

20:26.229 --> 20:30.493
Fans. Imbeciles fit only
to be gnawed by rabid rats.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.158
Yes. Someone could write a book.

20:34.226 --> 20:37.657
How about, "a boy and his fans,"...

20:37.724 --> 20:40.156
by Harlan Ellison
and h.P. Hatecraft?

20:40.224 --> 20:42.822
I was thinking something
more along the lines of,

20:42.889 --> 20:44.821
"shavu-ra hatafar,

20:44.889 --> 20:47.420
the fan that had no name."

20:47.488 --> 20:50.285
Except, uh, you just named it.

20:50.353 --> 20:54.284
Don't start with me, Ellison.

20:54.352 --> 20:57.083
You know, I'm glad we don't
have to go to college just yet.

20:57.151 --> 20:59.483
Yeah. It'll be good to get home...

20:59.550 --> 21:01.015
and back to solving mysteries.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.848
As a team?

21:02.915 --> 21:05.447
Absolutely. The way it should be.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.446
Huh?

21:07.514 --> 21:11.145
Darrow university library
darrow family archives?

21:11.213 --> 21:14.844
Wait. Aren't those the archives
the news said were stolen?

21:16.511 --> 21:19.775
Mr. e! Huh. Open it.

21:19.843 --> 21:22.475
Ooh. Carefully.

21:22.541 --> 21:27.072
If the first mystery inc.
Had what's inside this trunk,

21:27.140 --> 21:30.738
maybe they never would have
vanished in the first place.

21:30.805 --> 21:32.304
Wow!

21:33.537 --> 21:37.069
This looks like the entire
history of crystal cove.

21:37.137 --> 21:40.401
Gang, I think one mystery
just turned into two.

21:40.469 --> 21:41.503
Hmm.
