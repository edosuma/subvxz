00:00.918 --> 00:03.086
Previously on rescue me...

00:04.421 --> 00:07.841
For the next 10 years,
I've got you by the balls.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.136
And I asked you to do one,
single, solitary thing,

00:11.220 --> 00:15.682
to not have sex with your wife on the
same day that you're havin' sex with me,

00:15.766 --> 00:17.309
and you can't even manage that.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.519
Yeah, but she ambushed me.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.063
I mean, you can function fully on one
kidney. That's what the doctors say.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.105
It's cancer.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.440
I may go under the knife tonight.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.900
Aw, sean, I'm so sorry.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.401
We're gonna get an I.V. Started,

00:26.485 --> 00:28.070
and then we're gonna shave you for surgery.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.196
Oh, can I do that?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.114
Shut up, terrence!Jesus!

00:31.198 --> 00:32.448
He called me a whore.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.076
Nobody calls my daughter a whore.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.369
I'm gonna take care of this right now.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.289
I said she did some whorish things.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.375
Right. No, no, no!Tommy, stop!

00:41.500 --> 00:43.418
Katy sent us a letter.

00:43.460 --> 00:47.089
Basically she doesn't wanna see us again
unless we can act like grown-ups for a change.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.883
The first sign of trouble,
she's cutting us off for good.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.969
I've got a goddamn firehouse
full of men over there,

00:52.010 --> 00:55.681
my chief included, who keep on asking me what the
hell is up with that crazy bitch across the street

00:55.764 --> 00:58.183
who wants to talk to me, and
i don't have a goddamn answer.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.144
So you wanna talk to me,
leave me your goddamn number.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.896
Please use it. It's important.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.565
Home movies, gavin family.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.816

- Yeah.

01:05.941 --> 01:06.900
I think you're gonna pop this thing right in.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.443
- I might. I migh
- Right in the old dvd player.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.363
You're gonna sit back, pour yourself
a nice big tumbler of whiskey.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.656
Who-who told you?

01:12.698 --> 01:15.284
You did just now.

Hey, guys, can we stop for
chinese on the way back?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.366
We'll see, mike.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.243
Aw, come on, lou. I'm jonesin'
for pork fried dumplings.

04:44.326 --> 04:47.246
Do me a favor. Put these tools back on the
rig before they get ripped off, all right?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.748
And when I mean tools, I
don't mean bobby and niels.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.042
Now I know why I don't have kids.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.919
Yeah? Well, you don't know
what you're missin',lou.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.214
Yeah, you know, sometimes i think it'd
be nice have a little lou runnin' around.

04:58.757 --> 04:59.842
- No.
- Nah. Probably not.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.051
How you guys doin'?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.553
All good, chief. Yeah?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.806
Yeah, it's a great thing you had that ladder
up on the roof,'cause you saved our asses, man.

05:05.931 --> 05:09.977
Yeah. It was so close. His ankle's a little
twisted, but otherwise, everybody's fine.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.480
Listen, I heard that, uh, needle dick caught
you with your pants down the other day.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.815
Say, look, don't worry about it.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.733
I'm not gonna go put
your balls over the fire.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.777
- You had a moment of weakness, huh?
- Yeah.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.613
- You know, women can do that to a man sometimes.
- That's true.

05:21.655 --> 05:26.326
Shouldn't be punished for the occasional
bonehead move motivated by our primal instincts.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.744
That's profound, chief.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.205
So, uh, don't worry about needle.

05:30.330 --> 05:35.711
I think I got, uh, something on him that's gonna
trump that little back-seat bingo session of yours.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.004
Really? What do you got?

05:37.045 --> 05:40.465
All good things come to those who wait.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.969
- Try to keep it in your pants at the firehouse, ok?
- Ok. All right.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.972
I can't believe you got
feinberg in your corner.

05:47.014 --> 05:51.393
It's like the-the jets and the sharks
joining forces and becoming one giant,

05:51.518 --> 05:54.563
gay, dancing, singing street gang.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.190
- Yeah.
- You got a rabbi now in your corner.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.984
Ok, but let's not forget that, you know,
I also used to have a priest in my corner,

05:59.026 --> 06:02.112
and, uh, shortly thereafter,
he became defrocked.

06:02.154 --> 06:05.908
We talkin' 'bout that bingo game you had
with, uh, janet outside the firehouse?

06:05.991 --> 06:07.910
- It was nothin'.
- What do you mean it's nothin'?Somethin' dirty.

06:08.035 --> 06:08.744
Tell me.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.120
Why-why do you go right to dirty?

06:10.245 --> 06:11.705
- 'Cause-'cause
it's you. - Yeah.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.832
Good. Look. We, janet
and I have an arrangement.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.417
- You have an arrangement?
- Yes.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.921
Jesus christ. Tom, you guys have been
gettin' divorced for, like,8 years.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.673
Isn't it time you took that old dog
into the woods and put one in its head?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.218
All good things come to
those who wait, my friend.

06:24.343 --> 06:28.847
Well, you know what? If that's the case, then
your divorce is gonna be a goddamn carnival cruise.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.643
What's that?

06:32.726 --> 06:33.310
It's nothin'.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.020
- Got a text comin' in?
- Yeah.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.439
- From sheila, huh?
- Yeah.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.524
You're bangin' her, too, aren't you?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.108
You know what? What-what
is with the banging, ok?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.277
Cou-could you use something
that's a little more appropriate?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.739
Oh, I-I'm sorry. Y-you're "being
intimate" wi-with janet and sheila again?

06:45.781 --> 06:47.783
- Maybe I am, all right?
- Jesus christ.

06:47.866 --> 06:48.825
- What? What?
- Wait. Let me guess.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.620
This is a-it's a-it's a
no-strings arrangement, right?

06:51.662 --> 06:53.372
- And it was their idea. Am I right?
- Yes.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.790
Can't you even se- jesus christ.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.001
These are women, tom. Women have-they
got more strings than a goddamn baseball.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.294
Ok, y-you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.587
- I do too.
- You don't understand the situation.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.797
I know exactly what I'm talkin' about.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.550
L- let me explain to you, ok, what the
situation-I am takin' care of my kids, ok?

07:04.675 --> 07:06.468
My 3 kids, plus damian, ok?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.971
I'm damian's godfather, but
I'm also his father figure, ok?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.848
So I am manning up. That's what I'm doing.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.079
I'm peyton manning. I'm eli manning.

07:13.114 --> 07:15.269
I'm the entire manning family, ok?

07:15.310 --> 07:18.438
I am taking responsibility, and I am paying
for everything and taking care of all the kids,

07:18.480 --> 07:23.193
and in return, I get basically
free sex with no strings attached.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.279
Bullshit.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.864
- Do-you wanna call my thing bullshit?
- Yeah.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.156
- What about your thing?
- What about my thing?

07:28.198 --> 07:29.366
You're banging, uh, the hooker.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.618
Hey, watch what you're saying
and how you say it, tommy.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.619
I'm not bangin' a hooker.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.372
So-so what is her motivation for hangin'
around? She likes you? Let me guess.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.707
- It could be, tom. Could be.
- She likes you?

07:36.748 --> 07:37.749
- Yeah, could be.
- Oh, ok.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.711
And it wouldn't be that she's just hangin'
around because she's ba-basically casing the joint

07:40.794 --> 07:44.214
so that she can stay with us and become a third
roommate and then eventually just rob us blind?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.215
You think that's what's gonna happen?

07:45.299 --> 07:47.050
Wh-what do you think's gonna happen?
Of course that's what's gonna happen.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.719
You wanna put money on that? You
wanna put money where your mouth is?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.262
- You wanna make a bet about tha-
- Yeah, I'll make a bet with that.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.180
What's your bet?

07:51.221 --> 07:54.892
That your no-strings bullshit relationship thing you
got goin' on with these 2 broads... It's not bullshit.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.768
Completely falls to pieces... Yeah?

07:56.852 --> 07:58.896
Before I cave to candy.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.272
You gotta clean my apartment.

08:00.314 --> 08:05.319
And if the-she ends up robbing you blind and
blah, blah, blah, you clean the apartment.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.113
Yeah. Well, I can always get
a second hooker to do that.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.656
They have those?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.950
Yeah, they got everything on craigslist.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.243
All right, bet.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.703
Unbelievable. Easy money.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.288
Yeah, right.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.289
Chinese?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.749
- Yeah, I'm starvin'.
- Yeah.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.210
All right, dumplin' boy,
suit up. You got your wish.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.794
Let's go. Saddle up, guys.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.886
It's a musical.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.640
Sean loved steven seagal, but
all the hospital had was musicals.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.600
Loves steven seagal, mom. "Loves. "

08:36.683 --> 08:39.019
Right. Present tense.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.730
I keep it on in the background
so he doesn't get lonely.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.691
Better pray he doesn't
wake up a raging queen.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.985
I'm gonna go get some coffee.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.195
Hey, ma, will you get me an orange?

08:48.237 --> 08:50.072
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.990
Damn, sean.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.326
Goddamn. He looks like he's
on death's doorstep, you know?

08:54.409 --> 08:58.789
Doesn't even really look like garrity,
except for that stupid look on his face.

08:58.831 --> 09:02.125
I guess he kinda does look like garrity.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.629
Aw, dude, his eye just twitched.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.298
Jeez, I saw it. slowed I
saw it. It kind of opened.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.467
Nah, his eye isn't open.
He's a goddamn vegetable, man.

09:10.634 --> 09:15.097
Not a vegetable. He's just in a,
you know, semiunconscious state.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.807
Looks like a cauliflower to me.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.308
Aw, buck up, you bunch of pansies.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.895
That's your friend in
that sickly, pale shell.

09:26.191 --> 09:36.827
How lovely to be a vegetable,
so settled, so still,

09:36.910 --> 09:40.455
so serene,

09:41.206 --> 09:53.844
completely vegetative, cucumbive or
potative, noncommunicative and green,

09:54.511 --> 10:01.935
how lovely to be a vegetable,

10:02.102 --> 10:12.529
how noble, immobility,
the one wish that I'd wish,

10:12.654 --> 10:22.456
to end up as an elegant side
dish, a veggie, how lovely to be

11:16.969 --> 11:22.683
how grand to be chosen to wind
up canned or pickled or frozen,

11:22.808 --> 11:38.866
how lovely a vegetable to be
How lovely a vegetable to be

11:43.120 --> 11:44.538
Maybe he can hear us.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.081
Nah, he can't hear shit.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.083
He always was a softie.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.589
I love you, sean.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.465
Mike, what the hell are you doin'?

11:56.300 --> 11:58.260
I'm just-I'm just tellin'
him how-how I feel.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.846
That's what you're supposed to do. You're supposed
to tell him that, and it helps him come back.

12:00.888 --> 12:05.684
You know, if that was me lyin' there, you leaned over,
told me how much you loved me, I'd run into the light.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.897
Doesn't look good.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.983
Aw, what a pussy.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.360
Come on. Let's get out of
here before he dies, huh?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.029
Come on. Come on, mike.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.413
Let me tell you what.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.916
I was not expectin' that.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.792
I know, man. What the
hell? Why didn't he tell us?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.336
Guys, he's gonna be fine. He's gonna be ok.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.755
Just don't think I can lose another
brother, you know, not like this.

12:34.838 --> 12:38.425
This is just- 8:00.8:00.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.844
- What?
- Bogy,8:00.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.471
Don't turn your head.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.014
Damn, man. How'd you see her?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.974
I mean, she's practically
standin' behind you.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.019
Yeah, I know. I didn't see her.
I smelled her. Chanel no. 5.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.730
Oh, my god. What a rack.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.023
What an ass.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.816
Kind of rack you read about.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.361
I'm gonna beat off to her later.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.198
What, I crossed the line?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.200
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.743
"Beat off.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.579
Wonder what kind of nipples she's got.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.497
All right, I'm goin' in.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.541
Easy, cowboy. I spotted her first.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.251
You smelt her. I spotted her, ok?

13:12.334 --> 13:13.710
I spotted her when we first came up.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.548
I was just tryin' to be respectful of our sick buddy
who's layin' in bed there before I made my move. Ok?

13:17.673 --> 13:19.675
I did.

13:20.759 --> 13:21.844
- Oh, jesus.
- Oh, my god.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.471
Don't tell me this asshole's gonna
pull the sensitive, weeping man routine.

13:24.513 --> 13:25.889
I was gonna do that, ok?

13:25.931 --> 13:27.140
- I invented it.
- You invented it?

13:27.266 --> 13:31.728
I was playing the weeping man when you were
an itch in your absentee father's pants.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.605
I'm not fakin',all right? Assholes.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.524
Hey, man, just take it easy.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.025
Don't go to pieces, all right?

13:37.109 --> 13:38.694
I'm really upset about sean.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.529
I know. It's gonna be fine, ok?

13:40.654 --> 13:43.073
That's our friend in there,
and he's hangin' on be a bare-

13:43.156 --> 13:46.243
- Pull your shit together, all right, man?
- Yeah. All right? Come on.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.162
He's fakin'.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.913
Excuse me.

13:50.164 --> 13:51.748
Here you go.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.458
Thank you.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.752
Come and sit. Yeah?

14:05.262 --> 14:08.599
Oh, that son of A... bitch.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.727
I've taught him too much,
and now I must destroy him.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.729
- I'll help you.
- Me, too.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.899
- oh Shit.
- Unbelievable.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.568
- Yeah.
- Hey, you got a sec?

14:19.651 --> 14:21.111
Yeah. What's up?

14:21.153 --> 14:23.572
Katy just called, and she wants to come home.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.823
That's great.

14:25.449 --> 14:29.244
She wants a family dinner, and
she wants colleen to be there.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.788
Family dinner. Ok. What's the problem?

14:32.331 --> 14:34.291
And her boyfriend.

14:37.169 --> 14:40.923
Ok, I'm assuming that, uh,
colleen's got a new boyfriend.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.383
Nope. Katy wants shawn.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.221
Why does katy want shawn?

14:47.262 --> 14:53.435
I
- I guess that I got a little carried away, you know, telling her how happy we were and how happy they were.

14:53.644 --> 14:57.689
You know, and meanwhile, colleen has been
e- mailing her, telling her how great shawn is.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.777
And this is of course before the whole
whore, name-calling, fire-hose thing.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.905
I don't think havin' shawn to dinner
is really an option right now, honey.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.699
What, because you violated his civil rights?

15:08.700 --> 15:11.328
Look, tommy, this is our first test.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.247
She's coming home tomorrow night.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.748
What do you want me to do about it?

15:14.790 --> 15:19.586
Just get him to that dinner,
and I'll work on colleen.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.182
Big, hot, sexy family dinner.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.810
That must get your dick hard.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.771
Don't you have a hooker you have to go see?

15:37.813 --> 15:40.399
Hey, you know what? At least I don't
have to have dinner with her family.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.569
Oh, though, you could probably order
that up on craigslist, couldn't you?

16:01.461 --> 16:06.216
It's like Trade you one mickey mantle
for a michael gavin straight up.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.679
I had my love-in with teddy.

16:11.638 --> 16:16.310
And I know you think that havin' a couple of
belts before you watch these home movies is-

16:16.393 --> 16:21.732
I don't know-gonna give you some kind of emotional
release, free your soul, and ease your burden.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.234
That's just bullshit.

16:24.318 --> 16:29.489
You're still gonna wake up with a head full of
sirens, and your father's still gonna be dead.

16:29.740 --> 16:32.242
Couple of drunken tears ain't
gonna change any of that.

16:33.285 --> 16:37.289
But i guess that's for me to
know and for you to find out, huh?

16:39.249 --> 16:44.338
Oh, and, uh, by the way, you're settin'
some example for your sponsee derek there.

16:45.714 --> 16:50.344
Guys like you, you think
everybody is an alcoholic, ok?

16:50.928 --> 16:54.598
You can't have a couple of drinks, have
a good time, why should anybody else?

16:54.640 --> 16:57.809
You wanna take everybody. You wanna go right into
bars, and if you could, you would, wouldn't you?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.561
You'd go into bars at
night, and you'd grab 'em,

16:59.603 --> 17:07.109
and you'd stick 'em into your little gang of
coffee-swillin',cigarette-suckin' cave dwellers.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.904
But no, no, no.

17:08.987 --> 17:13.032
That's-I have gratitude towards you and A.A.

17:13.200 --> 17:19.289
, Because my year of sobriety has taught
me, really, a-an invaluable lesson.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.459
And you know what that lesson is?

17:22.501 --> 17:24.419
No.

17:24.962 --> 17:28.089
Sobriety sucks.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.426
That's why we invented
booze in the first place, ok?

17:31.510 --> 17:32.719
I saw teddy.

17:32.761 --> 17:33.971
He's happier.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.640
He-he's more in touch with his feelings.

17:36.723 --> 17:43.313
He's-he's full of life again, not sittin' in some
church basement with his head stuck so far up his own ass

17:43.355 --> 17:48.151
that all he can see is the-the
meatball parm he has for lunch that day.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.699
My head's out of my ass.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.247
Do you know one of the things you always
told me as my sponsor was to keep it simple.

18:00.289 --> 18:02.958
It doesn't get much more
simple than this, ok?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.170
I am drinking again.

18:08.172 --> 18:11.967
Why don't you stick that
on a goddamn bumper sticker?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.554
Thanks.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.184
Hey, man. What's goin' on?

18:20.726 --> 18:22.394
Don't even talk to me, man.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.522
Why? Wh-what'S...

18:25.564 --> 18:28.901
Should have your ass written up for
that hose-down you gave me the other day.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.778
Some degradin'- ass shit, tommy.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.948
Degradin'- ass shit?

18:35.032 --> 18:37.284
Now you're gonna play the race card.

18:37.618 --> 18:38.869
I ain't playin' nothin'.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.954
I'm just sayin'.

18:44.333 --> 18:50.339
you know, I really should apologize,

18:50.422 --> 18:52.466
'cause, you know, colleen has
always been able to push my buttons,

18:52.549 --> 18:56.637
man, and I-i have-you know, I got a
temper, and she-she pushed my buttons

18:56.678 --> 18:59.515
a- and I-I overreacted.

18:59.556 --> 19:03.101
S- and I'm sorry about that.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.190
You apologizin' to me?

19:08.273 --> 19:09.775
Yeah.

19:09.900 --> 19:14.821
Ok. You must need me for somethin',tommy.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.406
Yeah, that'll be the day when I need you.

19:16.490 --> 19:17.699
- That-
- Ok.

19:17.741 --> 19:18.784
Listen, where you goin'?What?

19:18.826 --> 19:21.870
H- hang on. Hang- wait.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.330
N- now who's overreacting now?

19:23.372 --> 19:26.458
L- listen. Listen.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.669
I need you a little bit. I got an idea.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.671
I just wanna-ok?

19:30.921 --> 19:32.422
Believe me, I'm tellin' you, man.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.258
We're havin' a family dinner.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.509
Katy's comin' home from school.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.095
Colleen's gonna be there, janet, ok?

19:38.136 --> 19:40.848
You come over, and it's a
perfect opportunity for you, man.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.809
You just-you're there, and you just shine.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.394
Shine?

19:45.477 --> 19:47.729
You mean like greasy shine?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.108
I don't know what greasy
- hey, no, no, no, no, no, man.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.609
That's not a racial thing.

19:52.693 --> 19:53.610
No, no, no, no.

19:53.652 --> 19:54.945
Star. You're the star.

19:54.987 --> 19:58.198
You come in there, man, and
she's like-y-you're actin' right.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.449
You're at dinner.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.243
- You're just

20:01.326 --> 20:02.244
No, it's not acting white.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.370
- You're just-your-
No, no, no.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.372
That's code word for acting white.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.748
No, it's not, man. It's not.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.000
I'm not playin' that, man.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.960
I'm talkin' like you're gentleman.

20:10.002 --> 20:15.299
You're a gentlemanly guy, and so all the bad feelings go
out the window, because she sees you being a gentleman.

20:15.632 --> 20:20.137
All right, so if you want me to come over and be
sidney poitier in guess who's coming to dinner, you-

20:20.220 --> 20:22.097
- Well...

20:22.890 --> 20:27.227
Eh, sidney poitier. I mean, that's-you know,

'Cause you got that, you

20:39.489 --> 20:43.952
You got that face. You got
that, you know, ageless thing.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.788
You know, that black thing that

20:46.830 --> 20:50.626

20:55.297 --> 20:57.883
- What?
- Dress white.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.051
No. Why is that white?

20:59.176 --> 21:00.511
That's a ni-he's dressed nice.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.305
He's, you know, dressed up.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.307
You know? I think he won
an oscar for that shit, man.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.601
- You come over, and you're just sidney-
- Ok, ok. I get it.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.311
- So...
- She'S...

21:09.394 --> 21:11.355
You want me to act white.

21:11.522 --> 21:14.399
You want me to dress white, eat white.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.779
And if you could talk a
little white, that-that-

21:18.820 --> 21:20.239
Listen, man.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.823
You know what I mean?'Cause it's her.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.368
She's impressed by it. It's
sidney. It's not-you know?

21:24.409 --> 21:26.829
It's a white thing, but it's
still kind of a black thing.

21:26.870 --> 21:30.791
Ok, listen. I'm not doin'
it for you, all right?

21:30.833 --> 21:33.544
I'll come over because-I
wanna get back with colleen.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.255
That's the whole idea. That's
what I'm sayin' to you here.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.422
Colleen's impressed.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.133
The ass-whore thing goes out the
window. You're back with colleen.

21:42.511 --> 21:46.139
I'm ready to get my sidney P. On.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.101
What?

21:49.142 --> 21:51.311
That's a black thing.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.314
It's not a black thing, man.
Tha-that's a potato, man.

21:54.356 --> 21:57.276
It's an irish thing, and it's
become a multiracial thing.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.695
Just don'T.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.322
Ok, derek jeter, jason
giambi. That's all I'm sayin'.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.615
Yeah, I get it.

22:03.657 --> 22:04.908
I'll be over.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.744
- All right.
- Sidney. Sidney.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.622
All right. All right.

22:10.664 --> 22:11.665
Dinner.

22:11.707 --> 22:14.168
- Yes.
- All right.

22:16.420 --> 22:20.883
Hey, tom, there's a
archie bunker on 2 for you.

22:20.924 --> 22:24.303
I hate you.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.398
What's with the outfit?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.232
What?

22:37.274 --> 22:39.526
Just get back from your
job interview at kinko's?

22:39.568 --> 22:41.612
Come on. You know I look sharp.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.989
I don't want any of your bullshit tonight.

22:44.031 --> 22:47.117
I don't even wanna see you right now,
but i wanna make my little sister happy,

22:47.159 --> 22:50.579
so if we have to play this
game, let's do it right.

22:50.621 --> 22:51.580
So be cool.

22:51.622 --> 22:53.332
Cool is how I do, baby.

22:53.373 --> 23:00.255
Stop trying to sound like isaac hayes when you're
standing here looking like the lost, retarded huxtable kid.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.927
I don't look like no damn huxtable.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.805
- And here we are...
- Oh, yeah.

23:08.847 --> 23:11.266
- Katy's favorite.
- Nice.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.352
Pot roast.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.646
It looks yummy, mommy.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.856
That rhymes. "Yummy, mummy.

23:17.898 --> 23:22.194
Right, babe. It was-it was a good one.

23:24.363 --> 23:25.989
- Ok, everybody, dig in.
- All right.

23:26.031 --> 23:30.452
Wait. We have to say grace.

23:30.661 --> 23:32.287
- Right.
- Of course we do.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.914
Of cours-of course we do.

23:33.956 --> 23:36.124
- Yeah, wi-will you do the honors, sweetie?
- All right.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.126
I want daddy to do it.

23:38.168 --> 23:42.548
Ok. Um, right.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.801
Joining of the, uh, hands.

23:45.843 --> 23:55.519
Uh, thank you, god, for this wonderful feast we are
about to eat and for all of us getting to be together

23:55.561 --> 24:02.651
and for black shawn, who-it
doesn't matter what color he is,

24:02.693 --> 24:04.862
because we're just really
happy and glad to have him.

24:04.903 --> 24:12.327
And also, for all the stuff that we have
and for brett favre being traded to the jets.

24:12.369 --> 24:14.830
- Amen.
- All right.

24:17.958 --> 24:21.628
I guess we should just dive right in.

24:23.881 --> 24:25.299
What do you want from me?

24:25.340 --> 24:26.633
Just to be with you.

24:26.675 --> 24:28.802
Why? Why me?

24:28.844 --> 24:34.474
You were the only man that never
felt like a trick or a mark to me.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.226
Well, the words every man yearns to hear.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.770
It's the truth.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.272
I discovered that in jail.

24:40.314 --> 24:42.065
As bad as they say?

24:42.107 --> 24:43.817
No. I got clean.

24:43.859 --> 24:50.866
I know now that I would never do anything
that could get me sent back there,

24:50.908 --> 24:58.207
and I would never again
do anything to hurt you.

25:02.961 --> 25:04.296
Aw, shit.

25:04.338 --> 25:05.589
What?

25:05.631 --> 25:09.635
Just realized I'm gonna lose a bet.

25:10.594 --> 25:12.429
Shawn, could you pass me the water, please?

25:12.471 --> 25:13.639
Sure thing.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.933
And dinner was amazing, mrs. Gavin.

25:15.974 --> 25:19.394
Why, thank you, shawn.
And you can call me janet.

25:19.436 --> 25:20.938
Ok. Janet.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.482
And by the way, that's a beautiful
dress you're wearing this evening.

25:23.524 --> 25:25.943
Why, thank you, shawn.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.320
Don't you want wine with your dinner, mommy?

25:28.362 --> 25:31.865
Oh, no, no, no. I-I don't drink anymore.

25:31.907 --> 25:33.283
And neither does your dad.

25:33.325 --> 25:35.494
I can totally vouch for that one.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.663
Is that true, daddy?

25:37.704 --> 25:38.789
Yep.

25:38.831 --> 25:41.834
Makes a great cup of coffee, though.

25:43.502 --> 25:45.254
I have your favorite dessert.

25:45.295 --> 25:46.421
Hot fudge sundaes?

25:46.463 --> 25:48.674
That's right. You wanna help me make them?

25:48.715 --> 25:49.591
Yes.

25:49.633 --> 25:52.219
- How awesome is that?
- You can pour the fudge.

25:52.261 --> 25:53.595
Here we go.

25:54.346 --> 25:57.432
- do you have vanilla?
- That's what we have.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.561
Seriously, calm down.
You're hitting on my mother.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.312
- I-I didn't do anything.
- You did too.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.523
- I didn't do anything.
- Calm down a little bit, ok?

26:04.565 --> 26:05.649
I'm freaking out.

26:05.691 --> 26:08.026
No, and, you, I cannot believe-I
know you've been drinking.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.027
Wha- I know you're drinking.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.028
I'm not drinking again. What's-

26:10.070 --> 26:12.364
Yes. I know. I can tell.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.950
- I swear...
- I didn't say-I didn't do anything.

26:14.992 --> 26:18.912
And you knew. Tell me. Stupid-

26:23.000 --> 26:24.585
Does everyone want hot fudge sundaes?

26:24.626 --> 26:26.920
Yeah!

26:28.463 --> 26:30.507
- Why...
- Put the fork down.

26:30.549 --> 26:32.551
- Dad.
- Why do I always...

26:40.559 --> 26:43.353
Wow, ken.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.981
Well, look. I'm-I'm
sorry, uh, about the mess.

26:46.023 --> 26:48.567
I haven't had a chance
to clean up in a while.

26:48.609 --> 26:52.279
Well, like, ever.

26:52.321 --> 26:57.701
Well, beats my cell in rahway, narrowly.

26:57.743 --> 27:01.705
Thank you, ken, truly.

27:07.002 --> 27:13.509
You should, um, probably have a seat
here, and, uh, make yourself comfortable.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.801
I've been lookin' for that.

27:14.843 --> 27:16.261
And, uh, there you go.

27:16.303 --> 27:20.140
And, um, I'll go, uh, make
the bedroom up for you.

27:20.182 --> 27:21.725
Uh, you mean us?

27:21.767 --> 27:25.896
No. I think, uh, just you f-for now.

27:25.938 --> 27:30.400
We'd better just go a little
slow in that department.

27:30.442 --> 27:34.821
I'm still dealing with the
shock of having you back.

27:34.863 --> 27:39.076
By the way, if you see a tall, drunk, irishman
wandering around, it's just my friend tommy.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.369
He's crashin' here, too.

27:40.410 --> 27:44.498
Just relax. Whatever you
do, don't open the fridge.

27:44.540 --> 27:48.627
And, uh, I'll be back
in, like, a-like an hour.

27:51.755 --> 27:57.344
Ok, probably gonna need, like,
um, like a hour and a half, maybe.

27:57.386 --> 28:01.139
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you, too, sweetheart. Good night.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.432
- We did it.
- I know.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.476
We did it. Did you see how happy she was?

28:04.518 --> 28:06.478
- She loves us again.
- I know. It was great.

28:06.520 --> 28:12.109
Oh, gosh, I was so nervous at first, but the more
that we went on, it kind of just seemed like old times.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.360
Yeah, it was awesome.

28:13.402 --> 28:14.570
Kind of like a normal family.

28:14.611 --> 28:15.988
I know.

28:16.029 --> 28:19.116
Ah, and I finally felt a connection with her.

28:19.158 --> 28:21.076
And colleen.

28:21.118 --> 28:22.369
- Ok, and shawn...
- I know.

28:22.411 --> 28:23.871
Is such a sweet guy.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.289
What are you doing?

28:25.330 --> 28:28.375
I thought-I thought we
were having-gonna have sex.

28:28.417 --> 28:31.420
No, no, no, no. Not with
the baby and katy out there.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.880
No.

28:32.921 --> 28:39.469
Honey, honey, honey I can
- I can definitely be quiet.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.388
No sex.

28:41.430 --> 28:47.603
Yeah, but on the bright side, you have regained
the unconditional love of your youngest daughter.

28:47.644 --> 28:50.314
Right.

28:51.398 --> 28:55.944
Can't have the unconditional
love and the sex at the same time?

28:55.986 --> 28:58.572
No. Ok. Got it.

28:58.614 --> 29:00.365
No, no. Why don't you do what you used to do?

29:00.407 --> 29:05.996
Just go downstairs and watch some tv, and
then when she falls asleep, then you can go.

29:06.038 --> 29:07.706
Ok.

29:07.748 --> 29:11.001
Hey, thank you for tonight.

29:11.043 --> 29:16.423
'Cause I have a newfound respect for you.

29:17.549 --> 29:20.177
Respect.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.096
Yay, respect.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.432
R- e-s-p-e-c-T.

31:07.534 --> 31:10.829
Daddy?.

31:14.082 --> 31:15.083
What's up?

31:15.125 --> 31:16.502
I'm happy I came home.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.671
We are, too, honey. Good night.

31:19.713 --> 31:22.758
You know, mom is smiling again.

31:22.799 --> 31:26.929
She doesn't say nasty things about
you when you're in the other room.

31:26.970 --> 31:30.516
Wa-wait a minute.

31:33.852 --> 31:41.193
She-she's saying nasty things
about-what kind of nasty things?

31:41.235 --> 31:45.906
I like shawn. I hope he
and col work things out.

31:45.948 --> 31:48.158
I, um-why?

31:48.200 --> 31:53.205
You know, I just-I sensed a little
tension, like you and mom used to be.

31:53.247 --> 31:57.960
Well, th-they're in love, honey, and when
you get older, you'll understand that-

31:58.001 --> 31:59.795
I'm glad you're not drinking.

31:59.837 --> 32:03.924
It used to scare me sometimes, you
know, like-like you were somebody else.

32:03.966 --> 32:05.968
I hope you never drink again.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.344
Well, I-you know, I-

32:07.386 --> 32:11.014
Do you promise me you won't drink?

32:11.056 --> 32:15.310
We-it-that's-it's-it's-
that's a complicated-you know.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.895
I don't know if anybody can promise-

32:16.937 --> 32:18.814
Why?

32:18.856 --> 32:22.401
B- because nobody knows what, you
know, the future- what's gonna-

32:22.442 --> 32:23.610
Are you an alcoholic?

32:23.652 --> 32:25.112
No. Wait.

32:25.154 --> 32:26.697
Did mom say that?

32:26.738 --> 32:32.286
Well, no-see, we're studying president grant at
school, and he had to have a drink almost every day.

32:32.327 --> 32:35.330
Do you drink every day?

32:35.372 --> 32:38.375
No. No. Honey, honey, ahem.

32:38.417 --> 32:46.800
I did for a while, because I
was-I-you know, I had some grief issues

32:46.842 --> 32:52.222
and-when I was going through the problems
with your mom and your uncle jimmy was killed.

32:52.264 --> 33:01.440
I was very angry and-but I- I
learned how to deal with that,

33:01.481 --> 33:06.528
and now I don't have that,
you know-I can control it.

33:06.570 --> 33:10.011
I- I can have a little, tiny,
little bit, and it's not a-

33:10.046 --> 33:13.452
you know, it's-it's-that's
why things are goin' so good,

33:13.494 --> 33:16.371
'cause I'm-it's just I'm
different with it, you know.

33:16.413 --> 33:19.082
So you're in denial.

33:19.124 --> 33:22.294
No. No, no. No.

33:22.336 --> 33:27.799
So you can have a little bit to drink now,
and it's not gonna be like it was before,

33:27.841 --> 33:31.887
like we'd always worry
about bad stuff happening,

33:31.929 --> 33:35.933
and then you and mom are
gonna stay together forever?

33:35.974 --> 33:38.393
Yes.

33:39.811 --> 33:41.980
I love you, daddy.

33:42.022 --> 33:44.149
I love you, too, honey.

33:44.483 --> 33:47.110
Now go to sleep, ok?

33:48.737 --> 33:51.323
Have fun at work.

34:00.541 --> 34:01.875
- What's wrong?
- Is damian here?

34:01.917 --> 34:03.794
What? No. He's gonna be home
from probie school any minute.

34:03.836 --> 34:06.088
- Oh, ok. Well- - So you gotta
get in my room and drop the pants.

34:06.129 --> 34:09.091
Ok, but I wanna tell you about...

34:09.132 --> 34:11.342
I wanted to talk you about this whole...

34:11.385 --> 34:13.554
- Yeah. Shoot.
- You know, situation.

34:13.594 --> 34:14.847
Take your pants off.

34:14.888 --> 34:16.098
Um, what situation?

34:16.139 --> 34:18.891
You know, this-this whole thing.

34:18.934 --> 34:21.103
I feel conflicted, you know.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.230
Take your pants off. Ok.

34:23.272 --> 34:24.438
- I-I am.
- Have you been drinking?

34:24.481 --> 34:25.774
- Not yet.
- Oh, boy.

34:25.815 --> 34:28.318
You know, I mean, I know we
- it's sort of working great.

34:28.360 --> 34:33.072
I mean, I just-I guess, you know, there's
no reason, really, to complain about it even,

34:33.114 --> 34:38.954
but, you know, it's just I think the thing with janet
and my kids and then you and damian, I don't know.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.540
I mean, even though it's working good, maybe
we're kind of foolin' ourselves. You know, it's-

34:41.581 --> 34:43.000
Take your pants off now.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.418
Ok. Are you listening to me?

34:44.458 --> 34:47.045
Ok, so what?

34:47.087 --> 34:48.839
What?

34:48.880 --> 34:50.549
You were saying?

34:50.591 --> 34:53.969
I was saying-I was saying- ok, yeah.

34:54.011 --> 34:57.347
So do you think I'm an alcoholic?

34:57.389 --> 34:58.891
What?

34:59.308 --> 35:01.935
You stupid-

35:03.020 --> 35:04.313
Wake up!

35:04.354 --> 35:05.898
Listen to me.

35:05.939 --> 35:11.653
You are not an alcoholic!

35:11.695 --> 35:12.613
That's good.

35:12.654 --> 35:17.493
You are a functioning alcoholic.

35:17.534 --> 35:18.243
That sucks.

35:18.285 --> 35:20.204
No. No, no, no. It doesn't suck.
It's good. It's good. It's like-

35:20.245 --> 35:22.915
- I-it's not- Right.
- No, jim morrison...

35:22.956 --> 35:24.374
Was an alcoholic.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.001
He died.

35:26.043 --> 35:29.254
Miles davis quit everything
when he was, like,64 years old,

35:29.296 --> 35:32.007
and then 6 months later,
pbbbbt, dead as a doorknob.

35:32.049 --> 35:33.884
Right.

35:33.926 --> 35:36.845
You, my dear...

35:36.887 --> 35:39.097
Are like keith richards.

35:39.139 --> 35:44.228
You don't drink, and the
whole band goes down the tubes.

35:44.269 --> 35:49.191
So you have got to keep
your eyes on the prize.

35:49.233 --> 35:51.360
Which in this case, are the kids.

35:51.401 --> 35:52.277
Right.

35:52.319 --> 35:57.908
Colleen, katy, wyatt,
damian, and... oh, yeah.

35:57.950 --> 36:00.244
These.

36:03.288 --> 36:04.748
Hey, ma! I'm home!

36:04.790 --> 36:06.166
What- Oh, shitbox!

36:06.208 --> 36:11.171
- What? I just took 'em off.
- Put your pants back on.

36:12.506 --> 36:17.219
Now, do not quit drinking
until much further notice.

36:17.261 --> 36:19.012
Functioning.

36:19.054 --> 36:20.806
Ok. Come here.

36:20.848 --> 36:22.307
Functioning.

36:22.349 --> 36:24.434
- Say it.
- Say what?

36:24.476 --> 36:26.478
Functioning. Functioning.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.649
Fu-ahh. Functioning.

36:31.441 --> 36:34.319
You're so funny when you wince.

36:34.361 --> 36:37.489
- Hey, ma!
- I'm coming!

38:19.925 --> 38:22.594
All righty.

38:49.746 --> 38:54.042
Oh, my god.

38:54.084 --> 39:02.509
You are such a good man to come here
and stand watch over my poor, sick boy.

39:08.348 --> 39:13.604
It really is a brotherhood,
isn't it, the fire service?

39:13.896 --> 39:19.485
I was just thinkin' about
a lot of stuff, and...

39:19.818 --> 39:24.156
life, you know, important stuff,

39:24.198 --> 39:29.995
and, uh-and it made me think about him.

39:30.579 --> 39:33.081
Yeah. Yeah.

39:33.123 --> 39:37.002
We should say a little prayer.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.851
Is that irish?

39:52.893 --> 39:54.561
Yeah.

39:54.603 --> 39:58.190
Gimme a blast.

39:58.899 --> 40:01.443
Sit down. Ok.

40:03.862 --> 40:06.698
No, son, the bottle. Give me the bottle.

40:06.740 --> 40:08.951
Y- you want the bottle?

40:19.837 --> 40:21.922
That's nice.

40:35.143 --> 40:38.438
What happened to sean's movie?

40:39.064 --> 40:41.358
Oh, I thought it was, uh... Ok.

40:41.400 --> 40:45.571
Come here.

40:48.532 --> 40:52.911
Our father who- take a knee.

40:52.953 --> 40:55.080
O- ok.

41:01.170 --> 41:09.303
Our father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

41:11.346 --> 41:21.064
Thy kingdom... Come, thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

41:21.106 --> 41:31.074
Give us this day our... Daily bread and forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

41:31.116 --> 41:39.124
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

41:39.166 --> 41:47.925
For thine is the kingdom and power
and the glory forever and ever.

41:47.966 --> 41:50.511
- Amen.
- Amen.
