20:45.078 --> 20:46.538
Fact! Every word!

20:46.746 --> 20:50.667
And not only that, I also captured
that shark over there

20:50.750 --> 20:52.877

Well, this show will not resort
to cheap trickery.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.050
Expensive, yes. Cheap, never!

21:40.592 --> 21:43.553
Wait a minute!
Don't I get anything outta this?

21:46.473 --> 21:51.519
On a scale of 1 to 10,
I give this plan a Pistoosa.
