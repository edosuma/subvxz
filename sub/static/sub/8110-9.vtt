WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:03.304
(Daisy)
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:03.337 --> 00:04.472
BETWEEN A SEA LION
AND A SEAL?

00:04.505 --> 00:05.673
(Jack)
WHAT'S THAT, BABY?

00:05.706 --> 00:07.808
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A SEA LION AND A SEAL?

00:07.841 --> 00:11.379
UM, SEALS TELL THE TRUTH,
BUT A SEA LION'S ALWAYS LYIN'?

00:11.412 --> 00:14.315
A SEA LION HAS EARS.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.483
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.218
I FORGOT.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.753
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHEN WE GET TO THE ZOO.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.224
CAN WE HAVE
PIZZA TONIGHT?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.426
I'M NOT GONNA
BE HERE, DAISY. I'M--

00:25.459 --> 00:27.461
I'M GOING BACK
ON THE ROAD, REMEMBER?

00:27.495 --> 00:29.497
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
FOR TWO DAYS.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.366
I'LL BE BACK
IN THREE WEEKS THIS TIME.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.402
(woman)
SOMEBODY HELP HER!

00:34.435 --> 00:35.436
[gasping]

00:35.469 --> 00:36.737
SHE'S HAVING
A SEIZURE!

00:40.308 --> 00:41.342
(man)
ON THE TRACK?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.445
(man #2)
YEAH, THERE'S A LADY
DOWN THERE.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.381
(Daisy)
DADDY, COME BACK!

00:47.415 --> 00:48.549
DADDY!

00:52.453 --> 00:55.456
HEY.
LADY, ARE YOU OKAY?

00:55.489 --> 00:56.724
COME ON, COME ON,
HEY, WAKE UP!

00:56.757 --> 00:58.526
COME ON! GET UP!
HEY!

01:02.163 --> 01:04.265
COME ON.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.766
HELP ME!

01:07.368 --> 01:08.669
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

01:08.702 --> 01:09.737
COME ON!
HURRY UP!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.172
HURRY UP!

01:13.207 --> 01:14.408
AAH!

01:21.782 --> 01:24.218
[alarm sounding]

01:24.252 --> 01:28.489
[sustained tone]

01:28.522 --> 01:30.291
DADDY!

01:33.527 --> 01:35.329
(woman)
MOVE THE TRAIN!
MOVE THE TRAIN!

01:35.363 --> 01:37.465
[fists pounding]

01:47.508 --> 01:49.443
[Jack panting]

01:49.477 --> 01:51.479
[gasps]

01:51.512 --> 01:55.516
[indistinct shouting]

01:55.549 --> 01:57.851
[applause]

01:57.885 --> 02:01.322
(man)
HEY, MAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

02:01.355 --> 02:03.857
YEAH, I THINK SO.

02:03.891 --> 02:07.228
[cheers and applause]

02:09.630 --> 02:10.764
SHE'S EPILEPTIC.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.733
COME ON,
LET'S GET YOU UP.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.603
(Jack)
YOU GOT HER?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.638
YEAH, WE GOT HER.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.174
HEY, SWEETIE, I'M OKAY.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.475
DADDY?

02:26.614 --> 02:29.583
[Massive Attack's Teardrop]

02:29.617 --> 02:37.625
*

02:58.412 --> 03:02.483
I FOUND THIS CASE, UH,
IN THE E.R.--

03:02.516 --> 03:04.318
WHITE MALE, MID 30s,

03:04.352 --> 03:05.753
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS,

03:05.786 --> 03:08.389
ABNORMAL EKG.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.925
AND HE'S THE SUBWAY HERO.
[chuckles]

03:13.727 --> 03:15.863
YOUR ENTHUSIASM
IS IMPRESSIVE.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.265
WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME

03:17.298 --> 03:18.632
ABOUT
YOUR PRESENTATION.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.433
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU LEAD

03:19.467 --> 03:21.402
WITH YOUR MOST
INTERESTING SYMPTOM.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.536
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.239
EKG IS
MORE INTERESTING

03:25.273 --> 03:26.607
THAN LOSS
OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SO--

03:26.640 --> 03:28.909
GOD, SHE'S STILL TALKING.
MAKE IT STOP.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.644
HOUSE'S WORLDVIEW

03:30.678 --> 03:32.613
DOESN'T INCLUDE RANDOM ACTS
OF SELF-SACRIFICE.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.848
HE'S GONNA COUNT HEROISM
AS A SYMPTOM

03:34.882 --> 03:36.584
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.885
THE GUY DID
A WONDERFUL THING.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.453
CAN'T WE JUST TAKE THAT
AT FACE VALUE?

03:39.487 --> 03:41.455
YOU ARE ADORABLE.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.425
HEROISM DOES EXIST.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.225
WHAT ABOUT THE GUY

03:45.259 --> 03:47.027
WHO LANDED THE PLANE
IN THE HUDSON?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.228
NEWS FLASH--THAT GUY
WAS ALREADY ON THE PLANE.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.598
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE WOULD HAVE
KILLED EVERYONE ELSE ON BOARD

03:50.631 --> 03:52.032
IF IT INCREASED
HIS CHANCES.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.435
FACED WITH
ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH,

03:54.468 --> 03:55.869
A NORMAL PERSON
RIDES THE PINE.

03:55.903 --> 03:56.970
WHAT ABOUT FIREFIGHTERS?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.539
THE GUYS WHO UNDERGO
MONTHS OF TRAINING

03:58.572 --> 04:00.874
TO DENY THEIR OWN INSTINCTS
FOR SELF-PRESERVATION?

04:00.908 --> 04:02.543
(Taub)
ISN'T A FIREFIGHTER.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.412
HE PLAYS A BASS IN A BAND.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.548
SO HUMANITY
IS APATHETIC

04:07.581 --> 04:08.716
AND SELF-SERVING?

04:08.749 --> 04:09.883
YEAH.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.319
I WAS MUGGED ONCE.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.020
WHEN I SAW THE GUN,
MY LEGS WENT OUT.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.722
(Chase)
IT WAS FIGHT OR FLIGHT.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.590
DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
FIGHT OR FLIGHT OR FAINT.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.058
(Taub)
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.927
THE OTHER HUNDRED PEOPLE
STAYED ON THAT PLATFORM.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.662
THAT'S A NORMAL RESPONSE
TO DANGER.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.397
THE COWARD HAS SPOKEN.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.733
OUR PATIENT'S PROBLEM
IS NEUROLOGICAL.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.535
SYMPATHETIC STIMULATION--
STRESS TO THE BRAIN

04:27.568 --> 04:28.869
TRIGGERS A RESPONSE
IN THE HEART.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.738
GO FORTH
AND LOOK FOR MASSES

04:30.771 --> 04:32.873
IN CLARK KENT'S
LIMBIC SYSTEM.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.079
(Chase)
A BIT OF ATTENTION.ETTING

04:39.112 --> 04:41.349
EVERYONE KEEPS GOING
OUT OF THEIR WAY

04:41.382 --> 04:43.351
ASKING ME
IF I NEED ANYTHING.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.418
IT'S KIND OF NICE.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.054
SO WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE?

04:47.087 --> 04:49.423
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.924
IT'S JUST IMAGES,
LIKE FLASHES.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.426
I KIND OF WENT
ON AUTOPILOT.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.094
MY MEMORY DOESN'T GO
BACK INTO REAL TIME

04:54.127 --> 04:56.764
UNTIL I WAS
IN THE AMBULANCE.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.065
I READ
THAT'S PRETTY COMMON

04:58.098 --> 04:59.700
FOR PEOPLE
IN LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATIONS.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.068
(Eva)
JACK.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.836
HONEY.
UH, THIS IS MY WIFE, EVA.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.472
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:04.505 --> 05:05.539
YEAH, I'M FINE.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.775
THEY'RE JUST
DOING SOME TESTS.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.477
HOW'S DAISY?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.846
SHE'S NOT SO GOOD,
ACTUALLY.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.516
SHE WATCHED HER FATHER
JUMP IN FRONT OF A TRAIN.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.884
UGH.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.852
SHE'S STILL SHAKING.
SHE CAN'T STOP CRYING.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.521
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
TO HER?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.755
HE SAVED A WOMAN'S LIFE.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.624
HE COULD HAVE DIED.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.361
DID YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

05:27.395 --> 05:29.062
(House)
I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

05:30.631 --> 05:34.602
DINNER WITH YOUR MOM
ON THURSDAY.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.904
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.472
I KNOW.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.007
I'M DEFINITELY COMING,

05:40.040 --> 05:43.477
BUT WILSON'S GOT TICKETS
TO THE HONG KONG FILM FESTIVAL.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.413
EVER SINCE HIS BREAKUP,
HE'S BEEN A MESS.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.481
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TELL HIM
THAT I'M NOT GOING,

05:47.515 --> 05:49.016
SO MAYBE IF YOU
HAPPEN TO SEE HIM,

05:49.049 --> 05:52.586
YOU COULD MENTION
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.391
YOU SHOULD GO.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.126
WHAT? I CAN'T.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.428
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.497
OH, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S FINE.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.499
IT'S SWEET THAT YOU CARE
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND,

06:05.533 --> 06:08.502
AND, FRANKLY, AS YOU WILL
FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.438
MY MOTHER IS A HANDFUL.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.476
GO.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.578
I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.046
THIS FILM FESTIVAL.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.882
I HAVE HAD THESE TICKETS
FOR TWO MONTHS.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.151
YEAH, I KNOW.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.486
I'M DEFINITELY COMING.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.787
OKAY.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.557
BUT THURSDAY
IS CUDDY'S BIRTHDAY,

06:29.590 --> 06:31.492
AND HER MOM'S COMING DOWN--
IT'S A WHOLE DINNER THING.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.762
AND I THOUGHT,
MAYBE IF YOU SEE HER,

06:34.795 --> 06:37.431
YOU COULD MENTION
HOW UPSET YOU'VE BEEN.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.433
YOU HAVE TO GO.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.502
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
BIRTHDAY?

06:41.535 --> 06:44.004
IT'S NOT EVEN
A QUESTION.
SHE HAS ONE EVERY YEAR.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.707
HOW OFTEN DO YOU BREAK UP
WITH THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.809
OKAY, FOR YOU, IT'S MORE OFTEN
THAN MOST, BUT STILL...

06:48.842 --> 06:51.779
I'M A BIG BOY.
I THINK I'LL SURVIVE.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.617
[door opens]

06:56.650 --> 06:59.687
I WILL DEFINITELY
MAKE THIS UP TO YOU.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.790
[door closes]

07:02.823 --> 07:06.827
[sports announcer
speaking indistinctly on radio]

07:20.608 --> 07:23.711
[keys rattle]

07:23.744 --> 07:25.513
HEY.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
AM I IMAGINING THINGS,

07:27.014 --> 07:28.849
OR DID I SEE A BILLBOARD
WITH YOUR FACE ON IT

07:28.882 --> 07:30.551
ON MY WAY HOME TONIGHT?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.920
OH, WAS MY WHOLE FACE THERE?
'CAUSE I JUST SAW THE NOSE.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.788
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY WERE TAKING A PICTURE

07:34.822 --> 07:36.223
OF A BUNCH
OF DOCTORS TOGETHER.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.057
THEY DID.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.627
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IT ENDED UP JUST ME.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.930
WELL, YOU ARE PRETTY CUTE.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.767
YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH ME?

07:49.770 --> 07:52.606
I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE
IN THE ROOM.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.511
WHAT?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.646
I DON'T KNOW.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.649
THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE TENSE AROUND HERE

08:01.682 --> 08:05.586
SINCE THAT WHOLE
ONLINE-BOYFRIEND THING.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.555
PHIL'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.589
I'M NOT THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEM.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.224
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH FEELINGS FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.963
YOU'RE STILL MY HUSBAND.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.200
I STILL LOVE YOU.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.639
AND I WANT THINGS
TO BE OKAY BETWEEN US.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.943
ALSO, YOU'RE
A FAMOUS MODEL NOW.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.545
THAT'S PRETTY COOL...

08:31.579 --> 08:32.846
SEXY, EVEN.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.649
[both chuckle]

08:41.288 --> 08:44.558
[monitor beeping]

08:44.592 --> 08:47.227
SO I ADVANCE THROUGH
THE CAROTID BIFURCATION...

08:47.260 --> 08:48.562
(Chase)
ARE YOU ASKING?

08:48.596 --> 08:50.598
YES, I'M ASKING.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.299
I'VE ONLY READ
HOW TO DO IT.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.635
PRACTICE IS DIFFERENT
THAN THEORY.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.804
JUST TELL ME HOW TO DO IT.
YOU'RE GOING TO INJECT DYE

08:56.837 --> 08:59.773
JUST PAST THE TAKEOFF
FOR THE OPTIC ARTERY.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.609
RIGHT. NOW?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.210
[monitor beeping faster]

09:03.243 --> 09:04.344
HIS B.P.'S GOING UP.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.747
THE PROCEDURE'S
STRESSING HIS BODY.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.148
WELL, WHAT DO I DO?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.283
HOLD ON A MINUTE.
JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE

09:10.317 --> 09:11.819
TO REGAIN EQUILIBRIUM.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.121
B.P.'S UP,
HEART RATE'S 180.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.288
W-WHAT SHOULD I DO?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.858
GIVE ME THE CATHETER.
GET A CRASH CART.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.359
[alarm beeping]

09:19.392 --> 09:20.828
HE'S IN CARDIAC ARREST.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.032
MAYBE YOUR SECOND TIME
WILL GO BETTER.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.237
SO WE FINALLY KNOW
WHAT TAUB WOULD LOOK LIKE

09:30.270 --> 09:32.272
IF HE WERE LIFE-SIZE.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.141
CAN WE GO BACK
TO THE OFFICE NOW?

09:34.174 --> 09:35.175
YOU KIDDING?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.010
WE GOT
A DIFFERENTIAL TO RUN.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.912
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.914
THAT POSTER GOT ME LAID
WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT,

09:40.948 --> 09:42.650
SO DO YOUR WORST.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.685
(Masters)
ARRHYTHMIA PROVES
I WAS RIGHT.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.688
JACK'S PROBLEM IS HIS HEART,
NOT HIS BRAIN.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.822
SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT
ON A BILLBOARD,

09:48.856 --> 09:50.090
YOU SLEEP WITH NURSES.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.759
BUT WHEN YOU ARE,
YOU SLEEP WITH YOUR WIFE.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
I THINK YOU GOT
THAT BACKWARDS.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.795
THAT'S MY ELBOW
IN THE CORNER.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.129
WHAT'S YOUR WIFE
DOING LATER?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.966
HUH. THEY CHOSE YOU
AND CUT OUT CHASE?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.801
APPARENTLY,
MARKETING THINKS MY FACE

10:00.834 --> 10:02.736
IS THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.304
FOR REAL?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.073
(Masters)
BOTH OF OUR PATIENTS'
CARDIAC INCIDENTS

10:06.106 --> 10:07.307
HAPPENED
AFTER PHYSICAL STRESS.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.010
I'M GUESSING
VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.845
BUZZKILL.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.747
(Taub)
VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE WOULD
MANIFEST AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.783
COULD BE DRUGS.
TOX SCREEN WAS CLEAN.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.318
WHAT ABOUT AUTONOMIC
NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.353
IT COULD CAUSE ARRHYTHMIA
AND FAINTING.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.795
INAPPROPRIATE?

10:27.828 --> 10:31.364
I MEAN,
'CAUSE OF THE JEW THING?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.801
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
DYSFUNCTION--

10:33.834 --> 10:34.902
I LIKE IT.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.704
LET'S BIOPSY
HIS PITUITARY GLAND.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.772
ADRENAL VENOUS SAMPLING
MAKES MORE SENSE

10:38.806 --> 10:40.874
AND IS A LESS
INVASIVE PROCEDURE...

10:40.908 --> 10:42.342
WHICH YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT,

10:42.375 --> 10:44.277
BECAUSE YOU JUST WANT
TO CHECK THE PITUITARY,

10:44.311 --> 10:45.879
BECAUSE YOU STILL THINK

10:45.913 --> 10:47.915
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE GUY'S BRAIN?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.382
CAN'T FOOL YOU.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.685
HE HAS NO OTHER SYMPTOMS
FOR PITUITARY DISEASE.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.153
WE CAN'T STICK
A NEEDLE IN HIS BRAIN

10:53.186 --> 10:54.855
BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN HEROISM.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.989
(House)
FINE, DO IT YOUR WAY.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.224
YOU'LL WASTE HALF A DAY,

10:57.257 --> 11:00.794
BUT I'M SURE HE'S IN NO HURRY
TO GET BETTER.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.229
(Chase)
THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

11:02.262 --> 11:04.765
CONTROLS INVOLUNTARY ACTIONS,
LIKE YOUR HEARTBEAT.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.800
IF WE'RE RIGHT,
IT'S MANAGEABLE,

11:06.834 --> 11:07.935
BUT WILL PROGRESS.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.738
DO YOU THINK WE CAN CONSULT
WITH HIM?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.309
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU KNEW DR. TAUB.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.978
(Eva)
I DON'T.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.814
YOU SAW THE ADS.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.716
LOOK, NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU WERE WRONG YESTERDAY.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.184
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE HIM
THE FACE OF THE HOSPITAL

11:24.217 --> 11:25.986
IF HE WEREN'T
REALLY GOOD, RIGHT?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.228
[clears throat]

11:35.262 --> 11:37.931
DR. TAUB...

11:37.965 --> 11:40.267
THE PATIENT
WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.076
HOW CAN I HELP?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.766
[sighs]

12:12.800 --> 12:14.935
I FORGOT.
YOU GUYS TALK.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.905
LOOK, NO OFFENSE
TO EITHER OF YOU,

12:17.938 --> 12:19.773
BUT DINNER WITH YOUR MOM?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.776
COME ON, I-I'D HAVE TO ACT
LIKE A DECENT HUMAN BEING,

12:22.810 --> 12:24.444
AND YOU KNOW WHAT A STRAIN
THAT PUTS ON ME.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.214
AND, YOU, EVER SINCE
YOU BROKE UP WITH SAM,

12:27.247 --> 12:28.916
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT MOPE AND WHINE.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.884
IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE BUMMER.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.953
AND JUST
WHAT IS SO EXCITING

12:32.986 --> 12:36.123
YOU HAVE TO BLOW OFF
BOTH OF US TO DO IT?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.794
I JUST WANT TO SIT
ON MY COUCH IN MY UNDERWEAR,

12:40.828 --> 12:41.862
DRINK SCOTCH,

12:41.895 --> 12:43.931
AND WATCH THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF NEW JERSEY...

12:43.964 --> 12:45.132
BY MYSELF.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.134
I JUST WANT
ONE NIGHT OFF.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.869
IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?

12:48.902 --> 12:51.071
YES.
YES.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.973
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
ONE OF US.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.076
I CHOOSE WILSON.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.345
(Cuddy)
GOOD...

12:58.378 --> 13:01.815
BECAUSE HE'S COMING
TO MY BIRTHDAY DINNER.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.821
I DO NOT WHINE.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.397
JACK'S NOT EXACTLY
THE HERO TYPE.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.033
HE STARTED
THIS BAND IN COLLEGE.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.468
THEY GIG
AROUND THE COUNTRY,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.236
LOOKING
FOR THEIR BIG BREAK.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.305
IT'S BEEN 16 YEARS.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.074
THAT MUST BE HARD
ON YOU AND DAISY.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.010
IT'S LIKE
I'M A SINGLE PARENT.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.350
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.989
BUT I'M AT THE END
OF MY ROPE.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.027
WHAT JACK DID YESTERDAY
WAS SO INCREDIBLE,

13:47.060 --> 13:48.962
OUR BOSS
ASSUMED HIS ILLNESS

13:48.996 --> 13:51.298
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HIS BEHAVIOR.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.267
BUT IF THAT'S
NOT THE CASE,

13:54.301 --> 13:57.971
THERE'S MORE TO HIM
THAN YOU THINK.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.945
(Chase)
YOU THINK TAUB
REALLY COMES ACROSS

14:04.978 --> 14:06.880
AS THE MOST
TRUSTWORTHY DOCTOR HERE?

14:06.914 --> 14:10.283
[chuckles]
I KNEW IT WAS BUGGING YOU.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.353
THEY CUT ME OUT.
YOU'RE A PRETTY BOY.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.156
WORKS WELL WITH THE LADIES,
NOT SO MUCH WITH THE PATIENTS.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.558
NO ONE WANTS AN UNDERWEAR MODEL
PERFORMING THEIR SPLENECTOMY.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.527
WELL, I NOTICE THEY WEREN'T
EXACTLY KNOCKING DOWN YOUR DOOR

14:20.560 --> 14:22.029
LOOKING
FOR DR. TRUSTWORTHY.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.331
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M BLACK.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.234
CORTISOL LEVELS LOOK NORMAL.
WE WERE WRONG.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.102
WHICH HOUSE WILL INTERPRET
AS HIM BEING RIGHT.

14:29.136 --> 14:32.472
HE'S GONNA MAKE US BIOPSY
THE PITUITARY GLAND.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.311
(Chase)
YOU SEEM PRETTY CALM
FOR A GUY

14:38.345 --> 14:40.247
WHO'S SURROUNDED
BY RACISTS.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.083
80% OF THE PRINCETON
POPULATION IS WHITE.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.918
SOME ARE RACIST.
SOME AREN'T.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.186
WHITE WORKS
WITH BOTH DEMOGRAPHICS.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.255
SO RACE IS YOUR EXCUSE,

14:48.288 --> 14:49.556
NOT THE FACT
THAT YOU USUALLY LOOK

14:49.589 --> 14:52.259
LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO PUNCH SOMEONE IN THE FACE?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.262
(Chase)
WE'RE GOOD.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.397
O2 SATs ARE DROPPING.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.400
[alarm beeping]
HE'S NOT BREATHING.
SUCTION.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.236
[pump whirring]

15:03.270 --> 15:07.340
[tube slurping]

15:07.374 --> 15:09.609
SATs ARE COMING BACK.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.111
MUCUS PLUG.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.645
THAT'S WEIRD.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.151
(Foreman)
FLUID IN THE LUNGS.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.987
PNEUMONITIS?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.621
THAT DOESN'T FIT
WITH ANYONE'S THEORY.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.728
OUR TESTS FINALLY
RULE OUT THE BRAIN.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.298
THAT LEAVES THE HEART
AND THE LUNGS.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.033
PNEUMONITIS CAN BE CAUSED
BY BACTERIA,

15:33.066 --> 15:35.368
PARASITE, SOME KIND
OF AN OBSTRUCTION.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.070
WHO WAS THE GIRL
ON THE TRACKS?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.739
NEWS STORY SAID HER NAME
WAS CHLOE JEFFRIES.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.341
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.742
'CAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER REASON
BESIDES BEING SICK

15:42.775 --> 15:44.644
THAT HE'D RISK HIS LIFE
FOR A STRANGER.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.647
SHE'S NOT A STRANGER.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.050
THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS
IS AN EPILEPTIC.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.718
SO WE ASSUMED SHE WAS HAVING
AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE,

15:51.751 --> 15:53.420
BUT WHAT IF SHE WASN'T?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.655
WHAT IF SHE'S SICK TOO?
(Chase)
JACK IS AWAY A LOT

15:55.688 --> 15:57.324
ON TOUR.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.992
WHAT HAPPENS ON THE ROAD
STAYS ON THE ROAD.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.527
THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE
OF PNEUMONITIS IS INFECTION.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.562
SHOULDN'T WE BE GETTING
A SPUTUM CULTURE?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.197
THERE'S NO
SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION

16:04.231 --> 16:05.265
OF WHITE
BLOOD CELL COUNT.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.499
THIS IS MORE
LIKE TOXIC EXPOSURE.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.035
(Foreman)
HE'S GOT A POINT.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.736
WHY IS YOUR ASSUMPTION
OF HIS GUILT MORE VALID

16:09.769 --> 16:12.639
THAN MY ASSUMPTION
OF HIS SELFLESSNESS?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.274
BECAUSE MY ASSUMPTION
IS BACKED UP

16:14.307 --> 16:16.743
BY MILLIONS OF MEN,
AND TAUB,

16:16.776 --> 16:19.512
WHO'VE CHEATED
ON THEIR WIVES.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.149
FIND THE GIRL
AND THE LOVE NEST.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.617
EVERY HERO
HAS HIS KRYPTONITE.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.288
HELLO?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.589
SO WE'RE BREAKING
INTO THIS GIRL'S APARTMENT

16:29.622 --> 16:31.291
BECAUSE HOUSE THINKS
THAT TWO PEOPLE,

16:31.324 --> 16:33.393
STANDING 30 FEET APART
ON A SUBWAY PLATFORM

16:33.426 --> 16:34.594
HAVE TO BE LOVERS.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.696
GOD, YOU'RE A DRAG TODAY.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.132
LET ME GUESS.
BACK TO FIGHTING WITH THE WIFE?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.568
NO. WE HAD SEX
AGAIN LAST NIGHT...

16:41.601 --> 16:42.635
TWICE...

16:42.669 --> 16:44.371
AND AGAIN THIS MORNING.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.106
AW.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.477
RACHEL HASN'T WANTED
THIS MUCH INTIMACY

16:50.510 --> 16:52.545
IN A LONG TIME.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.281
I DON'T THINK IT'S ME
SHE'S HOT FOR.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.316
IT'S THIS INTERNET GUY.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.618
SHE'S JUST HAPPY,

16:58.651 --> 17:00.453
AND THAT'S
TURNING HER ON.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.489
SO SHE'S
NOT CHEATING ON YOU,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.624
AND YOU'RE GETTING
ALL THE ACTION YOU CAN HANDLE.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.194
I DON'T SEE THE DOWNSIDE.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.630
WHAT WAS JACK'S BAND CALLED?

17:10.663 --> 17:13.400
SUICIDE...SOMETHING.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.701
SUICIDE SEASON.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.336
SHE DOES KNOW HIM.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.571
QUESTION IS,
HOW'D THEY GET SICK?

17:18.605 --> 17:21.641
KRYPTONITE.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.547
EKG'S UNREMARKABLE,

17:27.580 --> 17:30.217
THYROID, LIVER, AND
KIDNEY FUNCTION SEEMS FINE.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.118
YOU'RE PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.820
I WISH THAT YOU
WOULD TAKE A SECOND LOOK.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.755
I'M TIRED ALL THE TIME,

17:35.788 --> 17:36.589
AND WHEN IT'S COLD,

17:36.623 --> 17:38.791
I GET THIS WEIRD PAIN
IN MY SHOULDER.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.560
I HAVE A PAIN IN MY LEG.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.429
YOU DON'T HEAR ME
COMPLAINING...

17:42.462 --> 17:44.597
EXCEPT FOR JUST NOW.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.467
HOW DO DOCTORS
GET THIS IDEA

17:47.500 --> 17:49.769
YOU'RE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE?

17:49.802 --> 17:52.372
PROBABLY
ALL THAT PULLING PEOPLE

17:52.405 --> 17:54.374
BACK FROM THE BRINK
OF DEATH.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.376
IT'S JUST A GUESS.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.711
MY OWN DAUGHTER
IS A DOCTOR.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.648
SHE MAKES A HOBBY
OF DISMISSING MY CONCERNS.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.815
SHE SOUNDS SMART.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.618
DID SHE TELL YOU
TO SAY THAT?

18:05.652 --> 18:07.787
[scoffs]
I'VE NEVER MET YOUR DAUGHTER.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.689
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

18:09.722 --> 18:12.759
SINCE YOU'RE CURRENTLY
SHTUPPING HER.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.815
WE HAVE A SITUATION.

18:35.848 --> 18:39.286
ROACH BOMBS, WHERE?
IN CHLOE'S APARTMENT.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.688
WHO'S CHLOE?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.190
UH, LOOK,

18:43.223 --> 18:44.524
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.592
WE'RE NOT GONNA
TELL YOUR WIFE.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.528
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.365
GUESS WHO SHOWED UP
LOOKING FOR JACK.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.700
HEY.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.867
HI.

18:54.901 --> 18:55.835
(Jack)
YOU OKAY?

18:55.868 --> 18:57.737
THE E.M.T. SAID YOU'D GONE
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.872
THEY HELP ME OVERNIGHT
FOR OBSERVATION. I'M FINE.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.841
I HAD TO COME HERE TO...

19:04.677 --> 19:07.280
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU DID IT,

19:07.314 --> 19:09.316
BUT THANK YOU.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.419
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.724
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT FLOWERS
OR SOMETHING.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.459
YOU'RE LIKE
MY GUARDIAN ANGEL.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.861
NO. I'M JUST A GUY
IN A BAND.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.330
(Chase)
MAYBE YOU'VE
HEARD OF THEM?

19:23.363 --> 19:25.232
SUICIDE SEASON?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.267
ONE OF MY NURSES
GAVE ME THE CD.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.968
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO LISTEN TO IT YET,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.837
BUT I HAVE A FEELING

19:30.870 --> 19:32.772
I'M GOING TO BE
YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.576
(Masters)
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO COUGH.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.677
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:37.710 --> 19:38.978
GETTING A SPUTUM CULTURE.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.913
THEY OBVIOUSLY
DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER,

19:40.947 --> 19:42.515
SO IT'S NOT
TOXIC EXPOSURE.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.752
JUST LEAVES MY THEORY--
INFECTION.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.654
IF YOU COULD JUST COUGH
UP A SAMPLE,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.789
WE CAN, UH, TEST
FOR PATHOGENS.

19:49.822 --> 19:50.990
UM...

19:51.023 --> 19:52.859
[coughing]

19:52.892 --> 19:54.427
SORRY, UM...
SORRY, NOTHING--

19:54.461 --> 19:55.728
THERE'S NOTHING
COMING UP.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.896
WELL, MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU.

19:56.929 --> 19:57.997
[tapping back]

19:58.030 --> 19:59.366
AAH!

19:59.399 --> 20:01.234
OHH! IT HURTS!

20:01.268 --> 20:02.569
(Chloe)
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

20:02.602 --> 20:04.771
[groaning]

20:04.804 --> 20:06.906
ROUND, EQUAL,
REACTIVE TO LIGHT.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.441
IT'S NOT A STROKE.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.442
[Jack moans]

20:09.476 --> 20:11.378
NO, IT'S NOT MY HEAD.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.313
IT'S MY EARS.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.389
"WHEN I SAW HER LYING THERE,
I THOUGHT,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.657
"'I CAN'T JUST STAND HERE
AND LET HER DIE.

20:24.691 --> 20:28.261
SHE HAS HER WHOLE LIFE
TO LIVE.'"

20:29.862 --> 20:31.431
(Masters)
HE DIDN'T JUMP
BECAUSE HE WAS SICK

20:31.464 --> 20:32.532
OR BECAUSE
HE KNEW THAT GIRL.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.401
EVEN YOU HAVE
TO ADMIT THAT NOW.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.436
YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM A HERO.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.770
IT MAKES HIM
AN IDIOT.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.306
THE ONLY REASON
THAT HEADLINE DOESN'T SAY

20:39.339 --> 20:41.341
"MORON CRUSHED BY TRAIN"
IS LUCK.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.309
(Taub)
NEXT HEADLINE IS GONNA BE

20:42.342 --> 20:44.043
"MORON GOES UNDIAGNOSED

20:44.076 --> 20:46.313
BECAUSE DOCTORS WON'T TALK
ABOUT HIS EAR PAIN."

20:46.346 --> 20:48.481
(Masters)
EAR PAIN FITS
WITH MY THEORY.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.017
JACK HAS AN INFECTION
THAT'S SPREAD TO HIS MASTOID.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.552
(House)
GREAT. WE'LL CONFIRM THAT
IN A WEEK,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.487
WHEN YOUR SECRET CULTURES
HAVE SPROUTED.

20:54.521 --> 20:55.855
AM I IN TROUBLE?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.324
(House)
I ONLY GET MAD
WHEN YOU WASTE MY TIME.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.058
COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT YOURS.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.460
BUT LET ME KNOW WHEN
THEY COME BACK NEGATIVE,

21:00.493 --> 21:01.461
AND I'LL MOCK YOU.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.662
YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

21:02.695 --> 21:04.664
NOPE, SO I'M GONNA PICK ONE
AT RANDOM.

ACOUSTIC NEUROMA.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.967
(Foreman)
A TUMOR IN THE EAR--
MAKES SENSE.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.135
AND IF IT'S PUTTING PRESSURE

21:09.168 --> 21:11.638
ON THE BREATHING CENTERS IN
HIS BRAIN, EXPLAINS THE LUNGS.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.939
THE LUNGS
EXPLAIN THE HEART.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.312
THIS COUNTS AS MY TIME.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.414
YOU GUYS GOT THIS?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.020
I HAVE BEEN GOING
OUT OF MY WAY

21:28.054 --> 21:30.657
TO BE NICE TO OLD JEWISH LADIES
FOR MONTHS NOW

21:30.690 --> 21:32.992
ON THE OFF CHANCE
ONE OF THEM COULD BE YOUR MOM.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.961
YOU COULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED
SHE'S A SHIKSA?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.598
SHE CONVERTED
WHEN SHE MARRIED MY DAD.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.899
YOU SEE,
NOW IS TOO LATE.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.200
I'M NOT BLAMING
YOU FOR THIS.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.936
SHE'S THE ONE WHO AMBUSHED YOU
TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU WERE LIKE,

21:43.970 --> 21:46.005
BECAUSE I "NEVER
TELL HER ANYTHING."

21:46.038 --> 21:47.840
I'D HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HER ON THAT ONE.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.643
ANYWAY, I OBVIOUSLY
CAN'T COME TO DINNER NOW.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.111
OBVIOUSLY?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.547
WELL, SHE'S CRAZY,
AND SHE HATES ME.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.615
HOUSE...

21:55.648 --> 21:59.486
I NEED YOU TO COME
TO THAT DINNER FOR TWO HOURS,

21:59.519 --> 22:01.954
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT,
AND BEHAVE LIKE AN ADULT.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.524
YES, YOU WILL BE IN HELL,

22:04.557 --> 22:07.460
BUT I WILL FEEL BETTER
HAVING YOU THERE.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.962
THAT IS
WHAT A RELATIONSHIP IS.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.099
WE AVERAGE OUR MISERY.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.405
THAT WAS...

22:18.438 --> 22:20.673
UNEXPECTED.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.575
I'M HAVING A GOOD DAY.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.944
I FINALLY RESOLVED
THAT THING WITH MY SISTER.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.446
WHAT THING?

22:26.479 --> 22:27.514
OH, WE HAD
THE WORST FIGHT

22:27.547 --> 22:29.616
OVER WHETHER IT'S TIME
TO PUT DAD IN THAT FACILITY.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.584
BEEN SICK OVER IT
FOR WEEKS.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.621
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.857
I ACTUALLY TALKED A LOT
ABOUT IT WITH PHIL.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.028
I SHOULD BE GETTING BACK.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.533
IT'S FINE NOW.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.701
I-IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.573
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM?

22:56.042 --> 22:59.111
I'VE NEVER MET HIM.

IT'S BEEN 37 MINUTES,

23:14.661 --> 23:17.163
AND EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.966
HOUSE IS WRONG AGAIN.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A TUMOR.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.501
HOUSE DOESN'T
USUALLY ACCEPT

23:21.534 --> 23:23.135
"WE GAVE UP HALFWAY"
AS AN ANSWER.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.773
[tones continue beeping]

23:26.806 --> 23:29.476
IF I COULD GET FLUID CLOSER
TO THE SOURCES OF INFECTION,

23:29.509 --> 23:31.544
I COULD GET
BETTER CULTURES,

23:31.578 --> 23:33.179
PROVE MY THEORY.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.214
I'M GONNA SET UP
FOR AN EAR DRAINAGE

23:35.247 --> 23:36.649
AND THORACENTESIS.

23:36.683 --> 23:39.752
I'LL ONLY BE WASTING
MY TIME.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.957
SHE'S A STUDENT.

23:44.991 --> 23:48.094
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO GO
WITH HER.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.603
I SAVED THAT GIRL.
I DID THAT.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.540
AND I'M
REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

24:00.573 --> 24:04.911
THIS WHOLE THING
HAS MADE ME WONDER...

24:04.944 --> 24:07.580
IF THINGS
COULD BE DIFFERENT.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.116
I HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME
AWAY FROM YOU.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.519
YEAH, WELL,
YOU LOVE YOUR MUSIC.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.687
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

24:14.721 --> 24:19.091
I THINK
THAT I HAVE BEEN...

24:19.125 --> 24:21.694
AFRAID...

24:21.728 --> 24:25.632
THAT I WOULD SCREW
THINGS UP,

24:25.665 --> 24:27.834
THAT I COULDN'T BE
THE MAN

24:27.867 --> 24:30.670
YOU AND DAISY
NEEDED ME TO BE.

24:30.703 --> 24:34.674
BUT MAYBE
I'M BETTER THAN THAT.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.142
HMM?

24:36.175 --> 24:39.546
[sniffles, clears throat]

24:39.579 --> 24:43.683
I AM GOING
TO QUIT THE BAND.

I THINK WE'D LIKE THAT.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.563
(Jack)
IT'S BETTER WITH THE DRUGS,

24:56.596 --> 24:58.164
BUT IT STILL REALLY HURTS.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.066
(Masters)
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE
SOME FLUID SAMPLES

25:00.099 --> 25:01.300

AND YOUR LUNG.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.935
CAN YOU GET UP?
LEAN FORWARD.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.071

25:06.739 --> 25:08.274

OKAY.

25:12.612 --> 25:16.883
[sighs, chuckles]

25:16.916 --> 25:19.318
THIS IS WEIRD.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.854
WHAT--WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

25:23.690 --> 25:26.225
THE PAIN IN MY EAR IS GONE.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.596
(Chase)
GONE? COMPLETELY?

25:29.629 --> 25:33.032
YEAH, WHEN YOU STUCK ME
IN THE BACK.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.570
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

IS...IS SHE GOING
TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE

25:54.320 --> 25:57.223
OR JUST THE CHEESE
AND CRACKERS?

25:57.256 --> 25:59.759
SHE'S GOING THROUGH A PICKY
PHASE--IT WON'T KILL HER.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.694
YOU'RE HER MOTHER.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.163
ALL I KNOW IS,

26:04.196 --> 26:07.233
WHEN YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE
GROWING UP, YOU ATE WHAT WE ATE.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.601
NO EXCUSES.

[fork loudly clanks

26:16.042 --> 26:17.710
WOULD YOU PASS
THE SALT?

26:23.215 --> 26:25.351
(Cuddy)
SHE HAD EGGS THIS MORNING
AND LOTS OF FRUIT.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.353
AH.
THAT EXPLAINS IT.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.221
EXPLAINS WHAT?

26:29.255 --> 26:30.222
SHE WAS
A LITTLE VILDER CHAIAH

26:30.256 --> 26:31.758
IN THE PARK
THIS AFTERNOON.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.693
SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO ANYTHING I SAID.

26:33.726 --> 26:34.994
MUST HAVE BEEN

ACTUALLY, THE WHOLE

THING IS A MYTH.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.070
IT'S A STUDY.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.172
I'M SURE
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

26:46.205 --> 26:50.209
I DIDN'T READ ANY STUDIES.
I JUST RAISED CHILDREN.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.714
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.182
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO KEEP UP

26:56.215 --> 26:58.184
WITH WHAT SHE EATS ALL DAY?
YOU'RE NEVER HOME.

[cell phone ringing]

27:02.454 --> 27:03.790
I'M SORRY.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.058
I HAVE TO GET THIS.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.897
TELL ME YOU NEED ME.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.098
JACK DOESN'T HAVE CANCER.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.933
GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.267

MASTERS STUCK HIM
IN THE BACK WITH LIDOCAINE,

27:15.301 --> 27:16.736
AND HIS EAR PAIN
WENT AWAY.

27:16.769 --> 27:17.804
(Foreman)
WE DON'T NEED YOU HERE.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.105
WE JUST NEED
TO FIGURE OUT

27:19.138 --> 27:21.140
WHY THIS GUY'S BODY
THINKS HIS EAR IS ON HIS BACK.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.777
BECAUSE HIS EAR
USED TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.879
WHEN YOU'RE A FETUS,
YOUR CELLS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.981
WHEN YOU GROW, THEY SPREAD OUT
AND SPECIALIZE.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.850
SOMETIMES
THE BODY SCREWS UP,

27:30.883 --> 27:32.384
AND THEY KEEP
THE OLD AREA CODES,

27:32.418 --> 27:34.186
REPORT
TO THE SAME PAIN CENTERS.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.321
REFERRED PAIN.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.323
(House)
LOOKS AND BRAINS.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.391
WHEN YOU STUCK HIM IN THE BACK,
YOU CUT OFF COMMUNICATION

27:39.425 --> 27:41.293
WITH THE PAIN CENTERS
IN HIS SPINAL CORD.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.729
SO WE JUST
NEED TO FIGURE OUT

27:42.762 --> 27:43.963
WHERE THE MESSAGE
IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.698
WHAT ABOUT HIS THYROID?

27:45.732 --> 27:48.000
HYPERTHYROIDISM WOULD EXPLAIN
ALL HIS SYMPTOMS.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.235
(House)
OR IT COULD BE HIS LIVER.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.837
(Foreman)
GOOD. WE'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT BOTH.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.339
(Masters)
FOR THE RECORD, REFERRED PAIN
DOES NOT RULE OUT INFECTION--

27:53.372 --> 27:54.340

WHEN YOU WERE WORKING
FOR YOUR MATH DEGREE?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.010
IF EUCLID HAD BEEN
A GUEST LECTURER,

27:58.044 --> 27:59.746
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN THE KID
SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW GOING,

27:59.779 --> 28:01.881
"ACTUALLY, YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN
THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM"?

MOM...

28:10.957 --> 28:13.325
THANK YOU,
SWEETIE.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.931
SO SAY YOU TWO
GOT MARRIED,

28:18.965 --> 28:21.968
WOULD YOU CONVERT
TO JUDAISM?

28:22.001 --> 28:23.770
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THAT FAR, MOM.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.405
THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY
INTERESTING QUESTION.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.243
I'M AN ATHEIST.

28:31.277 --> 28:34.013
(Arlene)
HONEY, HALF THE JEWS
I KNOW ARE ATHEISTS.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.314
IT'S ABOUT COMMUNITY.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.250
HOUSE ISN'T THAT BIG
ON COMMUNITY.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.952
AND WHY DO YOU
CALL HIM "HOUSE"?

28:39.986 --> 28:42.254
THE MAN'S NAME IS GREG.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.990
IT MAKES IT SEEM
LIKE YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

28:44.023 --> 28:47.193
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.195
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A CERTAIN AGE NOW.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.298
THE PARADE OF BOYFRIENDS
CAN'T BE AS AMUSING AS IT WAS.

28:52.331 --> 28:55.334
YOU NEED TO SETTLE DOWN,
LIKE YOUR SISTER.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.369
SETTLING DOWN ISN'T ALL
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.071
NEXT WEEK
IS SAM'S BIRTHDAY.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.340
I WAS GONNA
TAKE HER TO THE POCONOS AND--

29:03.309 --> 29:05.411
THAT'S VERY SAD.

29:05.444 --> 29:09.081
PERHAPS NOT THE BEST CHOICE
OF TOPIC FOR A FESTIVE OCCASION.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.217
I JUST DON'T WANT RACHEL

29:11.250 --> 29:12.985
GROWING UP
THINKING YOU'RE A SLUT.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.788
OKAY, I GOT THIS.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.857
FIRST OF ALL, MOM...

29:23.595 --> 29:25.064
OH, MY GOD.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.505
DID YOU...

29:33.539 --> 29:35.507
SEDATE MY MOTHER?

29:36.976 --> 29:38.978
KICKED IN JUST IN TIME.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.947
SHE'LL WAKE UP
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS,

29:40.980 --> 29:42.114
BE GOOD AS NEW.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.783
THINK OF IT AS
MY BIRTHDAY GIFT TO YOU.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.220
YOU TOLD ME TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.889
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I HAD A CHANCE.

29:49.922 --> 29:53.292
(Wilson)
LEAVING ASIDE THE FACT
THAT HOUSE IS A SOCIOPATH,

29:53.325 --> 29:57.029
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I'M--
I'M HONESTLY RELIEVED.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.366
YOUR MOM IS QUITE A H--
QUITE A HANDFUL.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.501
WHAT?

30:02.534 --> 30:04.136
I FEEL F--

30:04.170 --> 30:06.873
OH, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.
