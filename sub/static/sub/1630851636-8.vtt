04:58.689 --> 05:00.822

05:00.865 --> 05:03.868
if I could make it as an agent,
that I could advocate for them.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.001

05:06.044 --> 05:07.698

05:13.182 --> 05:16.185
And I wasn't about to let Lance
break me.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.447
That's why I stayed.

05:17.491 --> 05:20.102
That's why I did
whatever he told me to do.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.843

08:45.307 --> 08:47.701
In order for Clara to be
convicted of manslaughter,

08:47.744 --> 08:49.703
the A.D.A. has to prove that

08:49.746 --> 08:52.662
giving Dasha the fentanyl-laced
cocaine was reckless.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.534
But it was reckless.
I mean, if you ask me,

08:54.577 --> 08:56.361
Clara should've simply
refused to do it.

08:56.405 --> 08:59.669
Okay, well, remind me not
to put you on the witness list.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.280
We need to paint a picture
that it was impossible

09:02.324 --> 09:03.673
for Clara to say no;

09:03.717 --> 09:07.068
that she wasn't being reckless,
she was coerced.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.983
You're going after Clara's boss?

09:09.026 --> 09:11.855
Yep. Lance Thomas.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.248
Ranked the number one

09:13.291 --> 09:15.380
most powerful sports agent
by Forbes.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.426
And a notorious toxic bully.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.471
Between football and fashion,
I've seen this guy

09:19.515 --> 09:20.777
more times than I can count.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.474
He's only happy
when someone's crying.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.433
There are chatrooms devoted
to this guy.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.609
One user claiming to be
his ex-assistant said

09:26.653 --> 09:29.699
she got fired
for taking time off to do chemo.

09:29.743 --> 09:33.094
Another guy said
he had to sleep at the office

09:33.137 --> 09:34.356
because Lance threatened
to fire him

09:34.399 --> 09:36.140
if he ever beat
the kid into work.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.664
We need more
than Internet rumors.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.666
We need witnesses
that are willing to testify

09:39.709 --> 09:40.884
to his brutality,

09:40.928 --> 09:42.843
so it's not just
Clara's word against his.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.845
I'm on it.
DANNY:
Why aren't we going

09:44.888 --> 09:46.629
after Dasha Markovic's
responsibility?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.544
It's not like Clara
held her down

09:48.588 --> 09:50.024
and forced her
to snort that coke.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.069
Danny, you can testify
all day long.

09:52.113 --> 09:55.203
The woman is dead.
I would tread lightly there.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.683
Understood.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.684
Oh, and Danny...

09:57.727 --> 09:58.902
Yeah?

09:58.946 --> 10:00.251
I need you to track down
that drug dealer.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.644
See if you can get him
to testify

10:01.688 --> 10:04.038
that Lance sent all of
his assistants there

10:04.081 --> 10:05.822
to buy drugs for his clients,

10:05.866 --> 10:07.171
so we can establish the culture.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.347
Get a drug dealer
to rat on his customers

10:09.391 --> 10:11.567
and incriminate himself.
No problem.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.221
Anything else you want to ask
Santa for while he's at it?

10:13.264 --> 10:15.876
An acquittal, maybe.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.884
Yep, yeah. I just sent you
over a proposal.

Take a look at it and
let me know what works for you.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.932
Yeah. Sounds good. Bye.

[gasps] Ah! Damn it.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.639
Oh, shoot. Ah.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.337
Um, I got distracted
by my call.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.601
I guess December wasn't
the best time

10:45.645 --> 10:47.734
to start my consulting business.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.692
You know, I thought I'd have,
like, one client.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.694
All of a sudden,
I have seven businesses

10:51.738 --> 10:52.956
that want to redo
their brands.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.436

Maybe you want to skip
the Christmas cookies this year.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.440

They're gingerbread men.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.660

we were going to decorate them,

11:00.703 --> 11:02.487

on the tree.

Oh, the tree.I just wanted to make

11:04.098 --> 11:05.882
Christmas really special
after the few months we've had.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.450
So, I just got off the phone
with the tree farm guy.

11:08.493 --> 11:09.669
[chuckles]:
It's kind of funny.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.715
He delivered the tree
to my old address,

11:12.759 --> 11:15.109
'cause I didn't update
the tree farm guy.No.

another one?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.547
There's nothing available
till next week.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.244
No. No, no. That's too late.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.724
I'll figure out a time
to go out...No, no, no, no. No tree...

11:21.768 --> 11:23.508

figuring it out,

11:23.552 --> 11:25.075

some jurors

11:47.968 --> 11:49.491
with as much Christmas
spirit as you.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.145
Mm-hmm. We want to
steer clear of rebels

11:51.188 --> 11:53.234
who would never cave
the way Clara did.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.498
What we want are conformists.

If you're showing up
for jury duty,

11:58.065 --> 12:00.197
doesn't that kind of make you
a conformist already?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.851
[elevator bell dings]That's true.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.942
Oh, God.What?

When I read that it was
A.D.A. Robert Jones,

That's funny.

competitive atmosphere,

to make friends.

we just clicked.

the French Open last year.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.941
I thought
my career was over.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.335
I was really depressed, and...

16:28.378 --> 16:29.945
I guess Dasha could tell,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.382
because one day I came home
after physical therapy,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.384

It's a... it's a huge loss.

Miss Williams supplied her with

of fentanyl.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.589
Hey, Marissa,
do you have any connections

26:30.632 --> 26:32.155
in the Christmas tree business?

26:32.199 --> 26:33.853
Forget getting a tree.
You're not even gonna

26:33.896 --> 26:35.376
make it home
for Christmas Eve.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.812
What? Why not?

26:36.856 --> 26:38.422
Find a window.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.035
Oh.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.645
The blizzard just struck
New York City head-on.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.952
Roads are blocked.
Subways are down.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.954
We're snowed in.

26:47.997 --> 26:51.261
Ugh. There goes
my jury's Christmas spirit.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.573
TAHANI: I have some bad news.
Due to the blizzard,

26:58.617 --> 26:59.922
the mayor's office has issued

26:59.966 --> 27:02.316
an emergency declaration
restricting all

27:02.359 --> 27:03.752
non-essential travel.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.102
The roads, the subway,

27:06.146 --> 27:08.235
everything's shut down
until further notice.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.716
I apologize for the trouble

27:10.759 --> 27:12.674
that rushing this trial
has caused,

27:12.718 --> 27:17.287
but since there's nowhere we can
go, we might as well proceed.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.550
Clara, was that you who we saw

27:19.594 --> 27:22.031
using cocaine
on that video?Yes.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.685
Do you use cocaine regularly?

27:23.729 --> 27:27.384
No. That was the first and
only time I've ever tried it.

27:27.428 --> 27:30.213
Were you pressured
into using it?

27:30.257 --> 27:32.738
I was pressured
into doing a lot of things

27:32.781 --> 27:34.130
for my job, but not that.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.784
I wanted
to try cocaine that night.

27:35.828 --> 27:36.916
Why is that?

27:36.959 --> 27:38.004
I guess I just

27:38.047 --> 27:41.485
wanted to cut loose for once.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.227
Growing up, I didn't get
to go to a lot of parties.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.229
My family--
we didn't have a lot.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.231
I mean, my dad--
he worked really hard,

27:48.275 --> 27:50.233
but my mom passed away
when I was really young,

27:50.277 --> 27:55.282
so it was just him, raising five
kids on a bus driver's salary.

27:55.325 --> 27:58.111
And I had a job,
since I was 14, to help out.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.678
And I knew that if I wanted
to go to college,

27:59.721 --> 28:01.680
I was gonna have to work
way harder than everyone else.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.769
So I spent every moment I had

28:03.812 --> 28:05.988
studying or on the track.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.295
Anyway,

28:08.338 --> 28:10.776
that night, when I saw
everyone else doing it,

28:10.819 --> 28:12.603
I thought...

28:12.647 --> 28:15.389
maybe I could finally
have some fun, too.

28:15.432 --> 28:16.477
Was it fun?

28:16.520 --> 28:17.652
Not really.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.393
And now, seeing
what's happened to Dasha,

28:19.436 --> 28:21.264
I realize just how lucky I was
that there was no fentanyl

28:21.308 --> 28:22.701
in the cocaine I tried.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.834
Clara, why did you buy Dasha
that cocaine?

28:25.878 --> 28:27.531
I didn't feel like
I had a choice.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.056
I know that sounds crazy.
Of course I had a choice.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.058
But my boss, Lance Thomas--
he told me

28:32.101 --> 28:33.712
that he would fire me
if I didn't do it.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.715
And were you worried about how
you would support yourself

28:36.758 --> 28:38.325
if you lost your job?

28:38.368 --> 28:42.024
Well, I made minimum wage, and I
live in New York City, so, yeah.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.767
But it wasn't just
about the job for me.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.203
This was my dream.

28:47.247 --> 28:49.553
I wanted to represent athletes
more than anything.

28:49.597 --> 28:52.556
I wanted to be a voice for them,
I wanted to protect them.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.777
I didn't do everything
that I could to protect Dasha.

28:55.821 --> 28:59.041
I never should have gotten her
that cocaine.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.087
I'll regret the part I played
in Dasha's death

29:01.130 --> 29:03.393
for the rest of my life.

29:05.482 --> 29:08.703
No further questions,
Your Honor.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.705
[Jones clears throat]

29:10.749 --> 29:12.968
Before Dasha's death,
were you aware

29:13.012 --> 29:15.754
that people could overdose
from drugs?

29:15.797 --> 29:17.494
Yes.

29:17.538 --> 29:21.324
And have you seen the-the signs
around town-- subways, busses--

29:21.368 --> 29:24.066
that warn of the dangers
of fentanyl-laced drugs?

29:24.110 --> 29:26.068
I have.

29:26.112 --> 29:30.943
So is it fair to say
that you knew the risk,

29:30.986 --> 29:33.206
and yet,
you still supplied Dasha

29:33.249 --> 29:35.338
with the drugs that killed her?

29:37.776 --> 29:38.907
Yes.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.691
Nothing further.

29:42.563 --> 29:46.045
Well, I'm sorry, Bull.
The jury is as red as...

29:46.088 --> 29:48.699
I know I started it, but if you
use another Christmas metaphor,

29:48.743 --> 29:50.310
I'm gonna lose the will to live.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.615
[gasps]

29:51.659 --> 29:54.401
That looks fabulous.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.403
Did you find a bakery?Nope.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.927
Stayed up all night making it,
probably for nothing.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.494
Don't think I'll make it
to the party now.

30:00.537 --> 30:03.976
I'm sorry. At least
you're not snowed in at Rikers.

30:05.673 --> 30:08.110
Listen,
I came all the way out here.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.459
There's a freaking
blizzard outside,

30:09.503 --> 30:11.113
so I couldn't leave
even if I wanted to.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.811
Can you just let me speak
to him for a few minutes?

30:12.854 --> 30:15.814
You should have called ahead.
I would have told ya.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.294
No visitors are allowed
on Christmas Eve.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.730
Well, this isn't a social call.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.732
A young woman's life is
on the line.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.952
Would it kill you
to make an exception?

30:23.996 --> 30:26.128
No. But the paperwork might.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.130
Sorry, no can do.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.697
[sighs][garbled radio transmission]

30:29.740 --> 30:31.307
You see that suitcase
right there?

30:31.351 --> 30:33.179
I'm supposed to be
on a flight

30:33.222 --> 30:34.658
to Aruba right now.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.269
I was supposed
to actually leave last night,

30:36.312 --> 30:38.314
but I postponed my flight
to visit this inmate.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.316
And I get that none of
that is your problem.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.492
But I have had a rough
couple of months.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.886
My mom had a stroke,
and she and I...

30:44.930 --> 30:46.409
Well, it's never been easy.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.368
But I-I took leave from work
to take care of her.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.500
And when she recovered,
I said to myself,

30:50.544 --> 30:53.242
"Let's take care of me.
Let's-let's

30:53.286 --> 30:55.549
treat myself
to Christmas on the beach."

30:55.592 --> 30:59.118
But it seems like I'm gonna be,
uh, spending it here at Rikers.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.207
So if I'm gonna be stuck here,

31:01.250 --> 31:03.949
I would at least
like it to mean something.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.559
You done?

31:07.126 --> 31:09.519
Yes.

31:10.607 --> 31:13.262
My mom was a real piece
of work, too.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.571
Can you make it quick
before the shift change?

31:19.051 --> 31:21.488
Gone before you know it.
Thank you.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.236
Aha.You heard from Danny?

31:30.279 --> 31:32.281
Not yet. Hey, you got any cash?

31:33.935 --> 31:35.719
You hungry?

31:35.763 --> 31:39.158
Yes. So's the jury.
The, uh...Oh.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.377
The cafeteria's closed
for the holiday.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.597
You can't sympathize
on an empty stomach, huh?

31:43.640 --> 31:46.208
No.
Least we can do is feed them.

31:46.252 --> 31:47.557
They're not gonna
make it home tonight.

31:47.601 --> 31:50.212
I don't think that
there's enough junk food

31:50.256 --> 31:52.214
in the world to turn
this jury around.

31:52.258 --> 31:56.392
I know. We need to stall,
give Danny enough time

31:56.436 --> 31:58.742
to figure some stuff out.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.441
I don't think Judge Tahani's
gonna do us any favors.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.835
Why don't you talk

32:04.879 --> 32:08.404
to your old pal Rob and see
if he'll take a plea deal?

32:08.448 --> 32:12.278
You-you want me to float
a plea deal as a stall tactic?

32:12.321 --> 32:15.324
Well, he would do the same
to us, wouldn't he?

32:16.978 --> 32:20.242
You summon me here to tell me
how the jurors ended up

32:20.286 --> 32:22.505
with a stocking
full of snacks?

32:22.549 --> 32:24.507
They don't know
who bought the snacks.[scoffs]

32:24.551 --> 32:26.727
For all they know,
you bought the trail mix

32:26.770 --> 32:28.207
and the cheese puffs.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.296
I was counting on the fact
that no one can sympathize

32:30.339 --> 32:32.080
on an empty stomach.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.430
Eh. Oh, well, I'm still winning.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.954
You don't stop, do you?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.956
Look, I know I come on strong.

32:37.999 --> 32:41.655
I've got a big personality, and
that's not to everyone's liking.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.963
But at my core,

32:45.006 --> 32:48.444
I'm just a kid from the sticks
looking to make good.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.272
You came from the sticks, huh?

32:50.316 --> 32:51.665
I grew up in a mobile home.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.146
I'm the first in my family
to go to college.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.322
I didn't know that.

32:56.365 --> 32:59.542
Yeah, well, clearly,
I overcompensate.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.110
So says my therapist.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.286
Don't quote me on this,

33:04.330 --> 33:07.333
but I can sympathize with Clara.

33:07.376 --> 33:10.640
I mean, when you come
from nothing,

33:10.684 --> 33:14.993
you will do anything
not to return to...

33:15.036 --> 33:16.820
nothing.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.476
I get that.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.697
Cheese puff?

33:23.740 --> 33:26.091
They're the perfect blend
of chemical and crunch.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.354
[chuckles softly]

33:30.356 --> 33:31.661
What are you doing?

33:31.705 --> 33:34.447
You have
a little something there.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.102
The playing
field's only fair

33:37.145 --> 33:39.713
when we both look our best.

33:40.583 --> 33:44.587
So I'm glad that you can
sympathize with Clara

33:44.631 --> 33:47.155
because I actually want to talk
about a plea deal.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.984
See what, if anything,
is on the table.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.768
A plea deal?Mm-hmm.

33:51.812 --> 33:55.511
Well, if you're serious, I'll
run it up the ladder to the D.A.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.993
I'd appreciate that.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.302
Hey, um...

34:04.477 --> 34:06.435
Would you ever be interested

34:06.479 --> 34:08.916
in catching up
over a drink sometime?

34:10.961 --> 34:14.704
I don't mean to imply
any quid pro quo with the plea.

34:14.748 --> 34:17.577
You know what?
Don't answer that

34:17.620 --> 34:20.362
until we're done
with all of this.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.585
[door closes]

34:25.628 --> 34:29.023
As I predicted,
the dealer won't rat out Lance

34:29.067 --> 34:31.417
or his other customers.What an upstanding guy.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.767
But he swears up and down there
was no fentanyl in his supply.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.203
[chuckles]
I bet he does.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.596
JADE: Why did you make me
come here today?

34:36.639 --> 34:37.988
I don't have time for this.
Now I'm stuck here.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.556
JONES:
Excuse me a moment, sir.
I may need you

34:40.600 --> 34:42.341
as a rebuttal witness.I don't feel well.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.343
I need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.388
I'm sorry, I'm on the phone.
Be right back.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.522
Hi. Sir, sorry about
that. So, listen.

34:52.002 --> 34:54.309
[sighs]

34:54.353 --> 34:55.832
DANNY:
Bull? You there?

34:55.876 --> 34:57.225
Yeah.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.140
Well, the dealer claims
that he tests his stuff

34:59.184 --> 35:01.229
because dead customers
aren't return customers.

35:01.273 --> 35:04.406
Well, he's saying that so
he doesn't get prosecuted

35:04.450 --> 35:05.973
for Dasha's death.

35:06.016 --> 35:08.367
Maybe, but I had Taylor pull up
the arrest report.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.804
His house was raided the night
Clara bought drugs from him,

35:10.847 --> 35:14.199
and the coke the police
recovered had no fentanyl.

35:14.242 --> 35:17.463
So the fentanyl was added
afterClara bought it?

35:17.506 --> 35:19.421
Maybe Dasha juiced up
her own coke.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.423
Athletes can get hooked
on fentanyl patches.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.685
After they're injured.

35:22.729 --> 35:25.166
Did Dasha have an injury?

35:25.210 --> 35:26.950
I don't know.

35:26.994 --> 35:30.258
But there was someone else in
that room that night who did.

35:30.302 --> 35:34.828
Danny, you may have just
delivered a Christmas miracle.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.052
Are both parties ready
to give their closing arguments?

35:42.096 --> 35:43.750
Actually, Your Honor, we have
entered into plea negotiations,

35:43.793 --> 35:46.144
and the D.A. has authorized me
to make an offer.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.538
Your Honor, the defense is
no longer interested in a plea.

35:49.582 --> 35:51.758
You're not?We'd like to enter
into evidence

35:51.801 --> 35:53.194
this police report,
and we'd like

35:53.238 --> 35:55.240
to recall one
of the prosecution's witnesses.

35:55.283 --> 35:59.635
Ms. Kiernan, when you were
recovering from your hip injury,

35:59.679 --> 36:01.289
were you prescribed fentanyl?

36:01.333 --> 36:03.248
No. I don't think so.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.598
I would like to remind you
that you're under oath.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.121
I'd also like to inform you

36:07.165 --> 36:08.905
that all fentanyl prescriptions
are registered

36:08.949 --> 36:11.430
with the New York
Prescription Monitoring System.

36:11.473 --> 36:13.562
I wasn't able
to get access to the system.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.564
I'm not sure
Jade's in the database.

36:15.608 --> 36:18.524
Then it's a good thing
Jade doesn't know that.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.569
I was prescribed painkillers.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.658
I guess
they could've been fentanyl.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.660
CHUNK:
And that's how you became
addicted to fentanyl?

36:24.704 --> 36:26.401
Objection. Speculation.

36:26.445 --> 36:29.099
I'll allow it.
Please answer the question.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.101
I'm not addicted to fentanyl.

36:31.145 --> 36:32.755

36:34.192 --> 36:36.411
Feeling okay, Ms. Kiernan?

36:36.455 --> 36:39.109
I think I'm coming down
with something.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.286
CHUNK:Well, you seemed
okay yesterday.

36:41.329 --> 36:45.246
But you have been stuck in court
for quite some time.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.683
Mm, we all have.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.469
CHUNK:Did you know that fentanyl
withdrawal sets in

36:50.512 --> 36:52.427
after about eight hours,
roughly the amount of time

36:52.471 --> 36:53.994
that you've been here?

for the holidays, Chunk.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.134
CHUNK:
Ms. Kiernan,

37:04.178 --> 37:06.224
are you aware the police raided
the home of the dealer

37:06.267 --> 37:10.097
who sold Clara the cocaine
shortly after she purchased it?

37:10.140 --> 37:11.229
No.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.795
Could you read for me

37:12.839 --> 37:14.928
the highlighted line
on this police report?

37:14.971 --> 37:18.148
"Field test fentanyl--
negative."

37:18.192 --> 37:20.325
I can't help wondering.

37:20.368 --> 37:23.893
If there was no fentanyl in the
cocaine that Clara purchased,

37:23.937 --> 37:27.288
how did it get into the cocaine
that Dasha ingested?

37:27.332 --> 37:28.637
I have no idea.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.291
You testified yesterday

37:30.335 --> 37:31.858
that you were with Dasha

37:31.901 --> 37:34.252
when Clara dropped off
the cocaine, isn't that right?

37:34.295 --> 37:35.644
Yes.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.342
Did you cut Dasha's cocaine
with fentanyl

37:37.385 --> 37:39.866
to get a better high?JONES:
Objection!

37:39.909 --> 37:41.694

Overruled.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.696
Please answer the question,
Ms. Kiernan.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.394
No. I wouldn't do that.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.788
Dasha's dead because of you,
isn't she?

37:48.831 --> 37:50.311

Objection!

will believe Jade's responsible?

of misdemeanor possession
of a controlled substance,

38:30.786 --> 38:34.660
find the defendant,
Clara Williams, guilty.

38:36.444 --> 38:38.403
You sent them a son,

38:38.446 --> 38:41.623

You gave us all redemption.

The possession charge carries
about a year in prison,

39:03.819 --> 39:05.908
but we're gonna aim
for probation in sentencing.

39:05.952 --> 39:10.086
No matter what, it's better than
15 years in prison. Thank you.

you stuck your neck out

for a plea deal?
