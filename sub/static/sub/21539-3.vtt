00:05.038 --> 00:06.006
So your buyer,
to take this apartment,

00:06.039 --> 00:07.107
he needs to come in at full ask.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.942

New York City,

I'm the closer

I work harder than anyone else.

I think we should consider
lowering the price.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.068
Oh, I don't think so.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.104
I was thinking about
raising the price.

01:11.137 --> 01:13.873
I just think that if it sits
on the market too long

01:13.907 --> 01:16.076
with no change,
at the same price,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.444
it gets stale.

01:17.477 --> 01:20.480
I just think that it's gonna
create some kind of buzz.

01:20.513 --> 01:22.816
It's the opposite effect.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.984
My current listing

34,975,000 is
a very high price.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.924
Raising the price would be
the death for it right now.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.158
Raise the price?

01:32.192 --> 01:35.095
That's gonna kill
all my momentum.

I'm not gonna agree
with you.

in Jacuzzi tubs.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.500
Okay.

The apartment is huge,

04:28.935 --> 04:30.503
which is perfect for families.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.073
But because this apartment
was combined,

04:33.073 --> 04:34.507
it's got a really odd layout.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.644
So you have two living rooms
on either side

04:37.677 --> 04:39.412
with a kitchen in the middle.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.948
So it's kind of all disjointed
and over the place.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.083
This has a bunch
of little stairs

04:43.083 --> 04:44.117
to get to the living room,

04:44.150 --> 04:45.418
a bunch of little stairs
to get downstairs,

a bunch of little stairs
to get to the kids' room.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.338
Well, because of
the weird layout,

05:38.371 --> 05:41.608
we need to price it at under
$2,000 per square foot,

05:41.641 --> 05:43.443
which is--
I know it--

05:43.476 --> 05:45.078
I'd say five
and a quarter.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.079
No.

Absolutely no.

6 million is
a crazy-high number.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.525
That's $2,200 per square foot.

per square foot

05:59.759 --> 06:01.061
that is sold in this building

06:01.094 --> 06:04.297
is around $1,500.

what's gonna happen.

08:33.313 --> 08:41.321
* *

08:42.689 --> 08:44.624
(Mrs. Jones)
And this is the perfect place

08:44.657 --> 08:46.426
for a Friday night mojito.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.061
Are the neighbors not jealous?

08:48.094 --> 08:49.629
(Mrs. Jones)
The neighbors here are great.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.231
We were all raising
our families together.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.166
There's children that all
come out in the afternoon.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.869
I feel like this is New York's
best kept secret.

08:55.902 --> 08:56.903
And this is where
I come in.

08:56.936 --> 08:57.904
For the right price.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.139
Come on,
let's talk price,

08:59.172 --> 09:00.874
and we'll figure out
what the right price is.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.677
(Mrs. Jones)
We should get you to put your
skills to the test, Luis.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.778
(Luis)
You know what?

09:04.811 --> 09:07.614
I make this one,
I get 10% commission.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.020
Oh.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.789
Nothing.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.691
So tell me, why are you ready
to let this place go?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.359
It's such a beautiful house,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.161
we want to see people in it

09:21.194 --> 09:23.129
and being a part of
the neighborhood.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.298
The problem is,
we're not really

09:25.331 --> 09:27.033
up for negotiating
too much.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.436
Negotiating from
what price?

09:29.469 --> 09:31.905
We would like to get
3,500,000.

09:31.938 --> 09:35.041
That's our number.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.844
3.5 million is too high.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.713
At 3.5 million,
the Joneses are looking

09:39.746 --> 09:42.048
for around $450
per square foot.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.183
In lower Manhattan,

09:43.216 --> 09:45.452
you're looking at about
five or ten times that,

09:45.485 --> 09:47.053
but in Hamilton Heights,

09:47.053 --> 09:49.189
this is sort of the average
price per square foot

09:49.222 --> 09:51.157
that townhouses trade for.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.059
The problem with
this townhouse

09:53.059 --> 09:55.061
is the amount
of square footage.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.764
It's nearly twice as big
as most of the townhouses

09:57.797 --> 09:58.798
in this neighborhood,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.534
which makes this price tag
very expensive.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.802
This is how I see it--

10:02.836 --> 10:05.905
there is no houses of this size,
with this length,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.774
and definitely not with
a backyard like that,

10:07.807 --> 10:10.176
but the location--

10:10.210 --> 10:12.278
The massive perception is

10:12.312 --> 10:14.514
that 147 is too far north.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.450
The epicenter of Harlem
is south of 125th Street

10:17.484 --> 10:19.753
and that block
has really become

10:19.786 --> 10:22.055
a psychological
dividing line.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.824
The further away you're
getting from 125th Street,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.860
the perception is that
it's getting away

10:26.893 --> 10:28.228
from the heart of Manhattan.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.130
You've got the FDR
right here.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.632
You can get downtown in
literally 5, 15 minutes.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.833
(Mrs. Jones)
I just think people

10:33.867 --> 10:35.669
have a total misconception.

10:35.702 --> 10:39.039
It is what it is until they get
to live in the neighborhood

10:39.072 --> 10:40.674
and then find out
that it's otherwise.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.809
What do you think
the house is worth?

10:42.842 --> 10:46.212
I think the right value
for this is...

10:46.246 --> 10:49.482
around 3,310,000.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.985
That's--that's just not
gonna work for me, Luis.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.219
In our eyes,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.588
there still isn't any house
out there

10:55.622 --> 10:57.023
that can compare to this.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.024
We would like to get
3,500,000.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.627
We won't take
a penny less.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.395
Every seller tells you that,
but you don't understand.

11:02.429 --> 11:06.166
With the Joneses,
it's, like...

11:06.199 --> 11:08.068
<i>finito.</i>

11:08.068 --> 11:10.937
I'll do 3,500,000,

11:10.970 --> 11:12.772
but if offers start
coming in low,

11:12.806 --> 11:13.973
I don't want you
to feel insulted.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.809
Let's keep an open mind.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.745
Luis...

11:18.778 --> 11:21.548
3,500,000 with
a half-open mind

11:21.581 --> 11:23.950
if you can sink
this 14 ball.

11:23.983 --> 11:27.087
(Mrs. Jones)
Sounds like a deal to me.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.091
(Mr. Jones)
Oh!

11:31.091 --> 11:32.092
There goes the open mind.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.962
Whaaa!

11:35.995 --> 11:38.631
Call Knight-Frank in Beijing.
I want Shanghai on the phone.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.600
We need to get an offer.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.669
We're not accepting
that price.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.670
I get it.
I get it.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.872
Sounds like bullsh**.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.147
(Fredrik)
Jordan,

11:54.180 --> 11:56.116
we need to get an offer
for Cheryl.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.752
That's my job as a broker,
to just get an offer.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.121
For all I know, Cheryl could be
calling me any day now

12:01.154 --> 12:02.522
and wanting to
raise the price,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.424
although, I would like
to lower it.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.194
So I've already started reaching
out to buyers beyond Asia.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.530
(Jordan)
I can learn.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.598
What about
the Brazilian?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.066
They're coming
in two weeks.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.369
But I'm not gonna abandon
my original strategy.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.272
I very deliberately
targeted Asian buyers,

12:19.305 --> 12:20.807
and there's a reason
for that.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.776
Almost all the big deals that
we do now are on the park.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.778
It's all Chinese money.

12:24.811 --> 12:25.779
Cash!

12:25.812 --> 12:27.781
- Listen to this.
- Okay.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.883
I'm ready the wealth report
about all the wealthy people.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.184
The first example,

12:31.217 --> 12:33.486
anyone with $30 million
or more in wealth.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.288
One person with
$30 million.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.957
Guess how many of those
there are in Asia.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.095
Billionaires in Asia.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.697
488 right now,

12:43.730 --> 12:45.899
but 809 in ten years.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.367
That's a 66% increase.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.136
That is more than any other
continent.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.971
I mean, it's not
really complicated.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.341
When you're trying to sell
a $35 million apartment,

12:54.374 --> 12:55.542
you go where the money is.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.110
Call my Knight-Frank
in Beijing.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.578
I also want Shanghai
on the phone.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.879
You have the email blast.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.349
I want every single top
Chinese broker

13:02.382 --> 13:04.284
to have the list
in Time Warner

13:04.317 --> 13:05.685
when they wake up
and in the office.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.088
Well, it's 3:30 now,
a.m.--

13:08.121 --> 13:09.389
Good. Perfect.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.490
Some people might start
working early, like I do.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.658
Mm-hmm.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.659
Call.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.327
Singapore,

13:14.361 --> 13:19.299
1,724 people with over
$30 million in wealth.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.834
But here's the issue
with that,

13:20.867 --> 13:23.203
is that's an inflated number
based on social capitalism,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.405
which is an unproven
fiscal policy,

13:25.438 --> 13:26.873
and just look at the problems
in Brazil.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.308
So while these people
have money,

13:28.341 --> 13:29.576
we need to get them
over here,

13:29.609 --> 13:31.111
because frankly speaking,
I don't think it will last

13:31.144 --> 13:32.545
until 2023.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.780
That's a whole side issue.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.248
[chuckles]

13:35.281 --> 13:38.551
I have never met a more unique
animal than you.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.086
You make me smart
every day.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.355
But you're gonna make me
really smart

13:42.389 --> 13:43.723
when we sell Time Warner.

13:43.757 --> 13:44.724
[phone beeps]

13:44.758 --> 13:48.094
[woman speaking
foreign language]

13:48.094 --> 13:49.662
(Jordan)
Still don't understand this.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.769
(Luis)
So yesterday I saw 393 Convent--

13:55.802 --> 13:57.904
You don't understand how
beautiful this townhouse is.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.640
You put that house
in the West village,

14:00.674 --> 14:03.376
it's guaranteed
to be worth 35 mil.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.811
(Luis)
Once I get everybody
through that door,

14:04.844 --> 14:06.513
I know for a fact that
they're going to fall in love

14:06.546 --> 14:07.547
with that house.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.516
I know it,
but it's too far north.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.685
Location is always important
in real estate,

14:11.718 --> 14:15.055
but in New York City,
20 blocks is like 20 miles

14:15.088 --> 14:16.289
somewhere else.

14:16.322 --> 14:19.659
How do we make people
understand the neighborhood?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.661
Like, get a feeling of
what would it be like

14:21.695 --> 14:23.630
to spend the next ten years
of your life

14:23.663 --> 14:25.098
in this particular location?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.467
Something real.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.468
The house is so big,

14:28.501 --> 14:31.671
what if we do
a scavenger hunt?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.106
Okay. Continue.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.108
What if we hired
a tour guide

14:35.141 --> 14:38.712
to take people on a tour
of the neighborhood?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.280
If we have a tour guide,

14:40.313 --> 14:43.717
it'll feel like an attraction,
as opposed to a neighborhood.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.718
Let me ask you,

14:44.751 --> 14:45.919
what was your
neighborhood like

14:45.952 --> 14:46.920
when you were growing up?

14:46.953 --> 14:48.588
I lived in a--
I lived in a cul-de-sac.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.223
And everybody
knew each other?

14:50.256 --> 14:51.424
Everybody knew each other.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.625
Everybody knew
the mean lady

14:52.659 --> 14:54.594
whose kid wasn't allowed
to play with us.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.863
Everybody knew my family,
who would always invite people

14:56.896 --> 14:58.198
over for dinner.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.500
If, for example, I was to
move to your neighborhood,

15:00.533 --> 15:02.569
how can you get me
to understand

15:02.602 --> 15:04.270
those 20 houses,

15:04.304 --> 15:06.206
that lady who was mean,
that attorney--

15:06.239 --> 15:08.808
You would have to be
invited to one of

15:08.842 --> 15:13.079
the neighborhood
get-togethers.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.382
Yes.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.383
Exactly.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.717
I love it.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.052
I love it.

15:19.052 --> 15:22.088
Neighborhood block party--
genius!

15:22.122 --> 15:25.325
Boom!
I love it.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.393
Boom.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.794
I'm thinking
cocktail hour,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.696
in the backyard 'cause it
has such a nice garden.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.830
Yes.
That's it.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.132
So first thing's first,

15:32.165 --> 15:36.202
I want 75% of the list
to be real, real neighbors,

15:36.236 --> 15:37.570
and in the middle
of the backyard

15:37.604 --> 15:39.072
we have, like,
hardcore jazz--

15:39.105 --> 15:42.509
Like hardcore Harlem,
upbeat, fire--

15:42.542 --> 15:43.510
Soulful.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.111
Soul jazz.
Yes.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.513
And then people are dancing
in the garden--

15:46.546 --> 15:48.615
And then they'll see all
the neighbors know each other.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.783
All the kids
know each other.

15:49.816 --> 15:50.950
You're looking at a family.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.352
And maybe we can get
more listings.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.386
Maybe we get
more listings.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.488
And maybe I become
the mayor of Harlem.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.489
[chuckles]

15:56.523 --> 15:58.124
Imagine,
Luis for mayor.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.393
[chuckles]
Vote for Pedro.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.329
I'm not Pedro, okay?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.497
[laughter]

16:10.036 --> 16:11.071
Hi.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.072
Hi, Ryan.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.773
Ever since I got the listing
from Regina,

16:13.807 --> 16:15.041
I've been doing a
ton of work.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.376
You still have that family

16:16.409 --> 16:17.944
that's looking for an apartment
on the Upper West Side?

16:18.044 --> 16:19.379
You got to explain to him

16:19.412 --> 16:21.247
that kids like Central Park.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.615
The pre-school is right down
the block.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.151
I'm building a pool of buyers
with families

16:25.185 --> 16:27.153
to attend a big open house
I'm having.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.154
I love your outfit.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.255
Thank you very much.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.357
(Ryan)
But in the meantime,

16:30.390 --> 16:31.658
I've done some private showings

16:31.691 --> 16:33.660
with a few buyers who are
specifically interested

16:33.693 --> 16:35.061
in the Upper West Side.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.162
You know what,
it's probably best

16:36.196 --> 16:37.230
to give you kind of
a breakdown of, like,

16:37.263 --> 16:38.431
how this apartment
is laid out first.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.632
So this is two apartments

16:39.666 --> 16:41.167
that were combined.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.069
One penthouse was here,
one penthouse was here.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.239
This whole floor is kind of
your master suite.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.240
I think the layout's
funky.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.575
I do.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.910
It's one of the oddest layouts
I've ever seen.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.512
(Ryan)
No surprise.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.181
Everybody has a problem
with the layout.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.850
You're walking through
a labyrinth

16:56.883 --> 16:59.285
to get from one room
to the other.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.421
But
lo and behold,

17:01.454 --> 17:03.156
I got an offer.

17:03.189 --> 17:07.027
It's a low offer,
but it's still an offer.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.662
So I have actually
really good news...

17:09.696 --> 17:11.765
sort of.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.467
We have our first offer.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.468
First offer?

17:15.502 --> 17:16.603
Mm-hmm.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.104
The offer is low.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.239
Low?

17:19.272 --> 17:20.540
Pretty low.

17:20.573 --> 17:25.311
It's 3.8.

17:25.345 --> 17:29.482
3.8
is nonsense.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.452
5.5 to 3.8?

17:32.485 --> 17:33.586
I told my boss,

17:33.620 --> 17:36.289
"I'm coming back
with great news for you."

17:36.322 --> 17:40.493
I need to cool down
a little bit.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.962
She took that well.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.964
We're not accepting
that price.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.266
I-I get it.
I get it.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.068
But the reason
I wanted to tell you

17:48.068 --> 17:50.704
wasn't to make you
shocked and angry

17:50.737 --> 17:52.539
and getting all flustered.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.540
I'm--I'm hot.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.541
I know,

17:54.574 --> 17:55.975
but you still look good,
though.

17:56.076 --> 17:56.976
Please.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.078
You're just, like,
glowing.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.212
It's pretty--
I don't know.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.914
What kind of creams
do you use?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.318
What do you mean?

18:05.352 --> 18:07.020
I'm going to,

18:07.053 --> 18:10.724
but I still think we're priced
a little too high.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.025
The feedback
that I'm getting

18:12.058 --> 18:14.728
is that the apartment
is a little bit choppy.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.396
You have one
living room here,

18:16.429 --> 18:18.031
and then you have another
living room over here.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.265
There's a lot of stairs.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.934
Ryan,
excuse my language,

18:21.034 --> 18:25.305
but it sounds like
bullsh**.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.040
My idea is

18:27.073 --> 18:31.044
it's time to find
a new broker, I guess.

18:31.044 --> 18:33.346
(Ryan)
Everyone always blames
the broker.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.749
I can't hold a gun to
someone's head and say,

18:35.782 --> 18:38.752
"Do not tell me that the layout
doesn't work for you."

18:38.785 --> 18:41.154
The market's gonna bear what
the market's going to bear.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.390
Where are the family
with the children

18:43.423 --> 18:46.393
who really are perfect
for this space?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.161
There are so many of them
out there.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.629
I-I get it.
I get it.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.564
(Ryan)
I can promise Regina

18:51.598 --> 18:54.067
no broker is willing to work
harder to sell this

18:54.067 --> 18:55.368
than I am.

18:55.402 --> 18:59.205
I'm gonna throw the most
baby-friendly open house

18:59.239 --> 19:01.341
the Upper West Side
has ever seen.

19:01.374 --> 19:05.712
I actually think that
this was productive...

19:05.745 --> 19:10.016
in a really, really
strange way.

19:10.050 --> 19:11.084
(Luis)
This is a party.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.619
I can feel, it Ronnie.
I can feel it.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.221
Unfortunately...

19:15.255 --> 19:18.024
this is not the kind of party
I was expecting.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.701
- Hello.<i>Ni hao.</i>
- Hi.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.602
- Fredrik.
- Hi. I'm Helen.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.706
Helen is a business consultant
who specializes

19:32.739 --> 19:36.543
in relationships
between east and west.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.078
Always had this theory
that

19:38.111 --> 19:39.312
if you're gonna be good
at something,

19:39.346 --> 19:41.181
you really got to know
what you're talking about.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.682
There is Chinese saying

19:42.716 --> 19:44.784
that you know the other party,
you know yourself

19:44.818 --> 19:46.252
and you always win.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.088
- I like to win.
- Yeah.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.557
It's been six weeks now
and I still don't have a buyer

19:50.590 --> 19:52.058
for my Time Warner listing.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.062
[repeating Helen]

19:56.062 --> 19:57.097
Yes.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.098
- So that's the saying.
- This is good.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.299
Yes.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.834
I'm meeting with her
because I want to understand

20:00.867 --> 20:03.470
some of the cultural
nuances

20:03.503 --> 20:06.239
in dealing
with rich Asians.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.174
I mean, how do you
give me five in Chinese?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.410
There is no such thing.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.911
(Fredrik)
No high fives?

20:11.945 --> 20:13.113
What about high-kicking?

20:13.146 --> 20:15.148
I--that--you can't take
that away from me.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.449
[laughing]

20:16.483 --> 20:19.185
You have to position yourself
and doing the kick.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.288
[laughing]

20:22.322 --> 20:23.323
Wait, do you have a jacket
for me,

20:23.356 --> 20:24.924
maybe, like,
a Chinese jacket?

20:24.958 --> 20:26.159
I do have a girl one.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.627
It doesn't matter.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.296
(Fredrik)
I need to put myself
in the Chinese shoes.

20:30.330 --> 20:34.801
I need to be like
a real estate chameleon.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.202
Let me ask you something.
I'm very tall.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.203
Yeah.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.304
Very blue eyes.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.673
I don't look Chinese.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.108
How can I make the Chinese
buyer feel more welcome,

20:42.142 --> 20:44.444
feel more at home?

20:44.477 --> 20:47.514
You do not need to wear
Chinese clothes

20:47.547 --> 20:49.582
or change your appearance.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.352
(Fredrik)
I think it's really beautiful.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.120
I have some
really big listings.

20:54.154 --> 20:55.722
Well, I have one
specifically

20:55.755 --> 20:57.157
that is very, very
important to me.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.359
It faces northeast.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.061
North is not good.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.063
Why?

21:03.096 --> 21:04.798
North is too cold
in the wintertime.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.099
Too cold?

21:06.132 --> 21:08.068
The Chinese probably won't
like this apartment

21:08.068 --> 21:09.869
if only facing the north.

21:09.903 --> 21:12.072
This kind of information
for a real estate broker

21:12.072 --> 21:14.174
in New York City,
invaluable.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.842
Next time I'm showing
Time Warner,

21:15.875 --> 21:19.245
I'm not gonna focus on the
northern view looking uptown.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.549
I'm gonna focus east
looking across the park.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.085
You know that Chinese
are very good at saving,

21:25.085 --> 21:27.554
but one thing they actually
do not want to talk

21:27.587 --> 21:30.557
is money.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.826
How can you not talk money if
you're buying an apartment?

21:32.859 --> 21:33.960
You have to give an offer.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.729
You have to talk what
the apartment is worth.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.197
You need to do a search

21:37.230 --> 21:39.499
about that specific
Chinese client,

21:39.532 --> 21:41.101
find a way to communicate
with them,

21:41.101 --> 21:43.436
to make friends with them,
to gain their trust.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.637
So not be so aggressive.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.673
So when I walk in,
handshake.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.674
Right?

21:47.707 --> 21:50.577
Talk about the
east-facing windows,

21:50.610 --> 21:52.746
no north-facing windows,

21:52.779 --> 21:55.115
and then,
at the end,

21:55.115 --> 21:57.417
when we're hugging,
I whisper in her ear,

21:57.450 --> 21:59.619
"Can you afford it?"

21:59.652 --> 22:00.687
[laughs]

22:00.720 --> 22:01.855
(Fredrik)
This is amazing.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.156
I have so many ideas now
how I'm gonna act,

22:03.189 --> 22:04.891
what I'm gonna do,
what I'm gonna say

22:04.924 --> 22:06.126
when I'm showing Time Warner.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.062
Actually, all my listings
for the rest of my life.

22:09.062 --> 22:12.332
It's my secret...

22:12.365 --> 22:14.834
[quietly] which I maybe
shouldn't give away.

22:14.868 --> 22:17.537
How do we kiss
when we say good-bye?

22:17.570 --> 22:18.538
Do not do that.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.140
Oh. No kiss?
On the cheek?

22:20.173 --> 22:21.341
'Cause I meet you for
the first time and then--

22:21.374 --> 22:22.709
First we were sitting here
for a long time talking.

22:22.742 --> 22:23.943
[laughs]

22:23.977 --> 22:25.512
We had so much fun together.
Why wouldn't we kiss?

22:25.545 --> 22:26.713
No. We do not do that.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.882
Maybe now is a time for you
to be a little western.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.384
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.719
(Fredrik)
See you later, love.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.259
(Ryan)
My strategy for the open house

22:39.292 --> 22:42.762
today was to invite every
potential mommy-buyer

22:42.796 --> 22:43.930
on the Upper West Side.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.265
Did you have any luck
with those nannies?

22:45.298 --> 22:46.399
You took all those fliers
and you put them in front

22:46.433 --> 22:47.467
of all the nannies.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.702
Yeah.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.936
You know the mommy blog that
you're apart of--

22:49.969 --> 22:51.004
the mommy group?

22:51.104 --> 22:52.839
Could you post an apartment
for me?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.841
(Ryan)
This place is jam-packed

22:54.874 --> 22:58.445
with so much kid stuff
that they won't even notice

22:58.478 --> 23:00.914
the really messed up layout.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.050
Call it the shiny object
approach.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.889
I have kid games,
kid food,

23:09.923 --> 23:12.092
I have a band playing
kid songs,

23:12.125 --> 23:14.728
and a milk bar

23:14.761 --> 23:17.430
with 100% breast milk.

23:18.798 --> 23:19.766
Wow.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.202
Nah. No.
That's not true.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.237
Hi, I'm Ryan.
Thanks for coming.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.438
(Ryan)
Hey, Christopher.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.439
(Christine)
We're gonna have fun today.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.440
Can you say, "choo, choo!"

23:27.474 --> 23:28.775
- Bah!
- Whoo-hoo.

23:28.808 --> 23:29.876
Welcome.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.511
You can park your stroller
right over here.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.712
When you hear the music,
you dance.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.481
When we say the word, "stop,"
you freeze.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.082
I would just like to point out
first before we start

23:36.082 --> 23:37.450
how big this room is.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.652
And there's a lot more house,
so after this song,

23:39.686 --> 23:40.653
I'll give everyone a tour.

23:40.687 --> 23:41.921
One, two, three,
go!

23:41.955 --> 23:44.924
[playing up-tempo music]

23:44.958 --> 23:46.993
* *

23:47.093 --> 23:48.094
(woman)
Freeze.

23:48.128 --> 23:49.829
Everything's basically
brand-new.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.164
* *

23:51.197 --> 23:52.499
Stop!

23:52.532 --> 23:54.901
You have the big skylights
and the 16-foot ceilings.

23:54.934 --> 23:55.902
* *

23:55.935 --> 23:56.903
Stop!

23:56.936 --> 24:00.140
So this would maybe be
your bedroom.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.609
Will you bring me a buyer
if I do that?

24:02.642 --> 24:03.610
Yes.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.712
* *

24:05.745 --> 24:07.047
How do I look?

24:07.047 --> 24:08.748
* *

24:08.782 --> 24:10.583
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.118
Way to go.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.822
So you have three floors
over here,

24:15.855 --> 24:17.090
three floors over here,

24:17.123 --> 24:18.458
all of this space interior.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.794
It's not just an open box.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.600
Exactly.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.337
My strategy is working
perfectly.

24:30.370 --> 24:32.806
Between the ballerinas
and the face-paint

24:32.839 --> 24:34.074
and the balloons,

24:34.107 --> 24:36.710
no one is saying
a single thing

24:36.743 --> 24:38.411
about the layout.

24:38.445 --> 24:41.114
600 square feet
of outdoor space.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.115
That is Central Park.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.383
Oh-huh.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.617
* *

24:44.651 --> 24:46.419
* Hello, Laura *

24:46.453 --> 24:48.088
[all]
* Hello, Laura *

24:48.121 --> 24:49.489
(man)
Yeah, there you go.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.257
* *

24:51.291 --> 24:53.093
* Hello, Jessica *

24:53.126 --> 24:55.128
[all]
* Hello, Jessica *

24:55.161 --> 24:57.163
(Ryan)
Literally,
if you shut the door...

24:57.197 --> 24:58.164
[music stops]

24:58.198 --> 24:59.232
(woman)
Wow.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.500
- You can't hear anything.
- Wow.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.701
- That's impressive.
- Isn't that wild?

25:01.735 --> 25:02.702
Yeah.

25:02.736 --> 25:04.437
What do you think?
You think so?

25:04.471 --> 25:06.139
No.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.441
[laughs]
Do you see what's on my face?

25:08.475 --> 25:10.443
Aww.

25:10.477 --> 25:12.245
What's going on?

25:12.278 --> 25:14.114
I don't think
I'm supposed to move.

25:16.049 --> 25:17.684
(Ryan)
I think she does too.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.227
(Luis)
Ronnie!

25:27.260 --> 25:28.228
(Ronita)
What do you think?

25:28.261 --> 25:29.596
(Luis)
That looks amazing.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.268
My strategy today is to make
sure that every broker

25:35.301 --> 25:37.137
that walks into this open house
feels

25:37.170 --> 25:38.872
that they're walking into
a true and authentic

25:38.905 --> 25:39.873
neighborhood party.

25:39.906 --> 25:40.874
How are you?
Nice to meet you.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.108
Luis Ortiz.
Pleasure. Pleasure.

25:42.142 --> 25:44.277
How are you, sir?
Looking very sharp.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.645
Nice to meet you.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.647
(Ronita)
He went to the restroom.

25:47.681 --> 25:48.948
(Luis)
Okay.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.284
I want this open house not to
feel like an open house.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.353
(Ronita)
Hi. How are you?

25:53.386 --> 25:54.454
Thank you for
bringing that.

25:54.487 --> 25:55.889
I got all the neighbors
to come to the party,

25:55.922 --> 25:56.890
bringing their own food.

25:56.923 --> 25:57.891
(Ronita)
Those look great.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.159
Let's head to the back.

25:59.192 --> 26:01.027
I got the best caterer in town
to bring all the real--

26:01.027 --> 26:03.296
real, like, the most
amazing food ever made.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.099
How can somebody choose
to be vegetarian

26:06.132 --> 26:08.168
when you got this?

26:08.201 --> 26:10.804
I got a live jazz band.
I mean, this is a party.

26:10.837 --> 26:13.807
[playing light piano jazz]

26:13.840 --> 26:15.442
* *

26:15.475 --> 26:18.678
So come on.

26:21.114 --> 26:23.183
Hello.
How are you?

26:23.216 --> 26:25.352
I want to make sure that
everybody comes there,

26:25.385 --> 26:27.287
not to think they're
walking into a store,

26:27.320 --> 26:28.288
they need to buy something,

26:28.321 --> 26:31.658
I want them to
feel welcome.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.426
Today's the day to
eat until you die,

26:33.460 --> 26:35.128
but happily die.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.063
I want them to feel
the actual environment

26:37.063 --> 26:39.799
and it happens that the house
where the event is taking place

26:39.833 --> 26:41.134
is for sale.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.170
[indistinct conversations]

26:48.875 --> 26:50.076
(Luis)
Unfortunately,

26:50.076 --> 26:52.812
this is not the kind of party
I was expecting.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.883
Since the beginning, I knew it
was going to be very difficult

26:56.916 --> 27:01.388
to bring buyers and brokers
to 147th Street at this price.

27:01.421 --> 27:03.023
[wind whistling]

27:06.026 --> 27:08.661
When we woke up an saw that
the weather was not great,

27:08.695 --> 27:10.296
I should have gotten on
the phone and started calling

27:10.330 --> 27:12.365
people and making sure
that everybody was confirmed

27:12.399 --> 27:13.767
and making sure
that people were actually coming

27:13.800 --> 27:14.934
to the open house.

27:15.035 --> 27:17.037
All right, listen.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.071
Obviously,
I'm not happy,

27:18.104 --> 27:20.674
but got to make the best
out of it.

27:20.707 --> 27:21.675
Hello.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.043
- How are you?
- How are you?

27:23.043 --> 27:24.144
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

27:24.177 --> 27:25.845
We have some brokers
and some buyers in the house,

27:25.879 --> 27:28.415
so let's put on a show.

27:28.448 --> 27:30.250
The garden wraps around
the entire house.

27:30.283 --> 27:32.686
Neighbors have been here
for over 25 years.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.621
This is a very special
place.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.856
The idea for this event
was to show people

27:36.890 --> 27:38.391
who do not live
in this neighborhood

27:38.425 --> 27:40.760
how amazing it is
to be apart of it.

27:40.794 --> 27:42.562
But the people who do live
in the neighborhood

27:42.595 --> 27:44.130
were walking by,
they saw the music,

27:44.164 --> 27:45.665
they saw the party, and hey,
of course it's a party,

27:45.699 --> 27:47.667
free food, free drinks,
let's go.

27:47.701 --> 27:50.070
So everybody comes in.

27:50.103 --> 27:54.341
The owners kept all of the great
original detail.

27:54.374 --> 27:55.575
This is just fabulous.

27:55.608 --> 27:56.876
Look at the length
of the townhouse.

27:56.910 --> 27:59.112
You have a whole floor
for entertaining,

27:59.145 --> 28:01.881
and you still have three
more floors with bedrooms.

28:01.915 --> 28:03.016
Bedroom, bedroom,

28:03.016 --> 28:04.851
bedroom, bedroom.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.720
- Look at this.
- Look at this openness.

28:06.753 --> 28:07.921
It's airy.

28:08.021 --> 28:10.023
No townhouse
on the market for sale,

28:10.023 --> 28:11.324
at least for the past
three years,

28:11.358 --> 28:12.325
has been a corner
like this one.

28:12.359 --> 28:14.127
- Ten bathrooms.
- Whoa.

28:15.562 --> 28:16.896
Very nice.

28:16.930 --> 28:18.665
Check this out.

28:18.698 --> 28:21.167
Ah!
I love that.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.036
You know,
I have a client

28:23.036 --> 28:25.472
that I think would be
very interested

28:25.505 --> 28:26.606
in this house.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.375
I want to live here.
I want to live here now.

28:28.408 --> 28:29.709
- You want to move in?
- Now.

28:29.743 --> 28:32.212
In the end, it's not really
about the amount of people,

28:32.245 --> 28:35.648
it's about who's here
who happened to be serious,

28:35.682 --> 28:38.952
interested,
and possibly buyers.

28:40.653 --> 28:43.623
How much room is there
to negotiate?

28:43.656 --> 28:45.892
So you're convincing me
that 3.5 is--

28:45.925 --> 28:47.060
You should convince
yourself.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.328
[laughs]

28:48.361 --> 28:50.063
It's the oldest saying
of the book,

28:50.063 --> 28:51.798
but the reality is
that it's true,

28:51.831 --> 28:53.333
it only takes one buyer.

28:53.366 --> 28:54.567
I can feel it, Ronnie.

28:54.601 --> 28:55.669
I can feel it.

28:55.702 --> 28:57.103
It's gonna sell today.

28:59.673 --> 29:01.307
Ryan,
it's not gonna work.

29:01.341 --> 29:02.709
Well, I got babies
to feed.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.710
Please.

29:03.743 --> 29:07.380
It is a letter from Cheryl.

29:07.414 --> 29:09.516
Oh, my God.

29:15.655 --> 29:17.357
Ryan, did you get the phone call
from Darren?

29:17.390 --> 29:18.591
Yeah,
he'll call me back.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.026
- Okay.
- Thank you.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.728
So Olivia got her
real estate license

29:21.761 --> 29:24.464
and she is now on my team
as an agent.

29:24.497 --> 29:27.300
Now I have a new assistant
who's great,

29:27.334 --> 29:29.269
but he's got one
major flaw.

29:29.302 --> 29:30.270
Hey, Ryan.

29:30.303 --> 29:31.504
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

29:31.538 --> 29:33.173
- "Ryan" Ryan.
- Me.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.507
It is not his fault

29:34.541 --> 29:36.643
that he has the greatest name

29:36.676 --> 29:37.744
in the universe...

29:37.777 --> 29:40.046
Uh, wrong Ryan.
Hold on one second.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.214
But...

29:41.247 --> 29:43.616
in my office,
there is only one Ryan.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.352
This name thing isn't
working for me.

29:45.385 --> 29:47.854
This is gonna drive me
totally insane.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.390
What would make my life really,
really, really easy

29:50.423 --> 29:52.492
is if I could just
keep calling you Olivia.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.827
[laughs]

29:53.860 --> 29:55.428
How about Skip?

29:55.462 --> 29:56.596
You could be Axle.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.198
You could be Arnold.
Zeus?

29:58.231 --> 30:00.066
Serge.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.668
My initials,
R.D.

30:01.701 --> 30:03.436
R.D.
Deal.

30:03.470 --> 30:04.738
- Good. Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

30:04.771 --> 30:05.872
(Ryan)
Yep, thank you, Olivia.

30:05.905 --> 30:06.906
Just kidding!

30:16.016 --> 30:17.550
All right.

30:17.584 --> 30:21.087
After my amazing
baby-tastic open house,

30:21.121 --> 30:23.456
I get an offer,
which is awesome,

30:23.490 --> 30:24.491
but it was low.

30:26.593 --> 30:28.728
Last time I brought Regina
a low offer,

30:28.762 --> 30:30.830
[quietly]
she practically fired me.

30:30.864 --> 30:32.198
Excuse my language,

30:32.232 --> 30:35.068
but it sounds like
bullsh**.

30:35.101 --> 30:38.805
I had to figure out a way
to make her all warm and fuzzy.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.874
- Katherine?
- What's up?

30:40.907 --> 30:44.778
Do you think I could borrow
your baby?

30:44.811 --> 30:45.912
What's that?

30:45.945 --> 30:47.080
Do you think
I could borrow--

30:47.113 --> 30:48.081
Juliana.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.115
Temporarily.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.283
What are you gonna
do with her?

30:50.316 --> 30:53.219
I just need to take her
to a negotiation.

30:53.253 --> 30:55.121
I had a pig once,
a baby pig.

30:55.155 --> 30:56.122
Same thing.

30:56.156 --> 30:57.123
[chuckles]

30:57.157 --> 30:59.192
You think?

31:04.064 --> 31:06.066
(Ryan)
Regina.

31:06.066 --> 31:08.068
This is the niece
I told you about.

31:08.068 --> 31:09.836
Meet baby Juliana.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.605
[laughs]

31:12.639 --> 31:14.140
Do you want me
to take you there?

31:14.174 --> 31:15.375
No, no, hold on.

31:15.408 --> 31:16.843
Oh, I wish I can.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.945
Maybe next time
we go up there.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.116
(Ryan)
So far, so good.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.651
Here we go.

31:24.684 --> 31:26.553
I have good news for you.

31:26.586 --> 31:27.587
What is the good news?

31:27.620 --> 31:29.322
Julia, tell her
the good news.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.291
Exactly.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.292
What she meant
to say was,

31:32.325 --> 31:33.426
we have a new offer.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.261
They're a family.

31:35.295 --> 31:36.896
Higher than our last offer.

31:36.930 --> 31:38.898
I like that.

31:38.932 --> 31:42.302
At $4.2 million.

31:43.303 --> 31:44.504
[sighs]

31:44.537 --> 31:47.774
Ryan, do I have to go over
and over and over with you?

31:47.807 --> 31:51.111
4.2 is not gonna work.

31:53.613 --> 31:57.183
Is she texting?

31:57.217 --> 32:00.620
They just texted me
that...

32:02.555 --> 32:04.624
I-I can call their broker.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.259
I can try to get them up,

32:06.292 --> 32:07.327
but I'm gonna tell you
right now,

32:07.360 --> 32:08.661
they're not gonna come
to 4.9.

32:08.695 --> 32:09.963
Ryan, I don't want to
lose my job.

32:10.063 --> 32:11.264
And I don't want to lose
the deal.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.133
I got babies to feed.

32:13.166 --> 32:16.636
- Please.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

32:16.670 --> 32:18.071
Look, you see the seal?

32:18.104 --> 32:20.774
You see the seal?
Look at it.

32:20.807 --> 32:22.909
Okay, we're calling Dan,
the broker.

32:26.346 --> 32:28.715
Hey, Dan,
it's Ryan Serhan.

32:28.748 --> 32:31.584
It's Ryan Serhan--

32:31.618 --> 32:33.386
I'll just cut to the chase.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.155
There's no way
they're gonna do 4.2.

32:35.188 --> 32:38.091
They've come down to 4.9,
that's under--

32:42.662 --> 32:45.765
You're always a delight
to deal with.

32:45.799 --> 32:47.967
There's--there's a baby
in my arms,

32:48.001 --> 32:52.472
so if you could not swear,
that would be great.

32:52.505 --> 32:54.674
Listen, I don't have
a lot of time here.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.109
If we want to get this deal
done,

32:56.142 --> 32:58.611
you got to tell me how high
your people can come up.

33:01.514 --> 33:03.450
I don't know
if they're gonna do it,

33:03.483 --> 33:05.185
but I will let you know.

33:05.218 --> 33:08.154
4.5 is a great offer.

33:08.188 --> 33:10.056
It's just over $1,600 a foot,

33:10.056 --> 33:12.859
which is exactly where
apartments are trading for

33:12.892 --> 33:17.797
in this building.

33:17.831 --> 33:19.466
Their best and final

33:19.499 --> 33:24.304
is 4.5.

33:24.337 --> 33:26.139
Why don't you try
another 30 days?

33:26.172 --> 33:27.407
These are the perfect buyers.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.075
It's a family who loves
a family apartment.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.276
They are paying cash.

33:30.310 --> 33:31.978
They will close tomorrow,

33:32.078 --> 33:36.850
but at 4.5.

33:36.883 --> 33:39.719
4.5?

33:39.753 --> 33:44.090
Yes?

33:44.124 --> 33:45.091
Quick close?

33:45.125 --> 33:49.195
Yes.

33:49.229 --> 33:51.331
In cash?

33:51.364 --> 33:53.566
Yes?

33:53.600 --> 33:55.001
What--what he say?
What did he say?

33:55.101 --> 33:58.538
What did he say?

33:58.571 --> 34:01.141
Deal.

34:01.174 --> 34:03.043
What?
Really?

34:03.043 --> 34:04.044
Yes.

34:04.044 --> 34:05.078
Oh, did you hear that?

34:05.111 --> 34:06.079
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

34:06.112 --> 34:07.080
Did you hear that?

34:07.113 --> 34:09.049
Oh!
Oh, we love you.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.050
So that means we have a deal.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.184
Yes.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.819
Oh.
God.

34:12.852 --> 34:14.220
Yes!

34:14.254 --> 34:15.221
Finally.

34:15.255 --> 34:16.456
Clap.
Can you clap?

34:16.489 --> 34:18.058
See?
Look how happy she is.

34:18.058 --> 34:21.594
And I am ready for
nappies and a bottle.

34:21.628 --> 34:22.829
Whoo!
Are you happy?

34:22.862 --> 34:23.830
Clap your hands.

34:23.863 --> 34:24.831
[crying]

34:24.864 --> 34:26.533
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Fix it.

34:26.566 --> 34:28.601
[baby crying]

34:28.635 --> 34:31.137
(Ryan)
Oh, no.

34:37.177 --> 34:38.211
Hi.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.913
How are you?

34:39.946 --> 34:41.414
Time Warner,
Time Warner, Time War--

34:41.448 --> 34:43.717
I mean, Time Warner is the only
thing I can think about.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.086
24/7,
Time Warner.

34:46.086 --> 34:48.321
I have Swedish candy
if you want.

34:48.355 --> 34:49.322
Do you like Swedish candy?

34:49.356 --> 34:52.459
Uh, yeah,
it's okay.

34:52.492 --> 34:54.094
Oh!

34:54.094 --> 34:56.396
It's, like, the most
Swedish thing you can have

34:56.429 --> 34:57.697
More than a fish?

34:57.731 --> 35:00.600
Maybe not more than a meatball,
but, like...

35:00.633 --> 35:03.269
So we need to talk.

35:03.303 --> 35:06.573
Hmm?
What's up?

35:06.606 --> 35:11.811
It is a letter drafted by
the attorney for Cheryl.

35:13.580 --> 35:16.049
In said letter,

35:16.049 --> 35:19.185
Cheryl terminates us.

35:19.219 --> 35:21.621
What?

35:27.660 --> 35:28.661
[sighs]

35:30.530 --> 35:32.365
Oh, my God.

35:32.399 --> 35:33.433
Yeah.

35:37.437 --> 35:40.073
(Fredrik)
At my job, you can't always

35:40.073 --> 35:41.574
be in agreement
with all clients,

35:41.608 --> 35:43.943
but when someone sends
that kind of letter

35:43.977 --> 35:46.579
and sign it that way,
with that tone,

35:46.613 --> 35:47.914
there's nothing I can do.

35:47.947 --> 35:50.617
It would be disrespectful
for me to call her

35:50.650 --> 35:53.153
and chase her down
and try to change her mind.

35:53.186 --> 35:54.521
She is done.
She's taken off the market.

35:54.554 --> 35:55.822
It's over.

35:55.855 --> 35:57.590
I was just getting started.
You know what I mean?

35:57.624 --> 35:59.926
I still have 1 1/2 month
of listing agreement.

36:00.026 --> 36:02.228
New York Times, done.
[inaudible] done.

36:02.262 --> 36:05.532
The big broker party
which I promised her, done.

36:05.565 --> 36:08.935
I totally, completely
get it.

36:09.035 --> 36:11.538
I thought I was getting
through to her somehow...

36:11.571 --> 36:13.940
Let's just try raising it
from 35 to 42.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.508
I'm not gonna agree
with you.

36:15.542 --> 36:17.544
I'm trying to think,
like, was I too harsh?

36:17.577 --> 36:20.080
Was I too aggressive?

36:20.113 --> 36:22.115
If I can't communicate,

36:22.148 --> 36:25.318
if I'm not good enough
to explain to her

36:25.352 --> 36:28.054
how I feel and
how I perceive the market,

36:28.088 --> 36:29.656
then it's my fault.

36:29.689 --> 36:32.192
I'm willing to go
28, 29 million.

36:32.225 --> 36:34.094
I thought
I could get 50.

36:34.127 --> 36:35.095
Five zero?

36:35.128 --> 36:36.129
Quite frankly,

36:36.162 --> 36:39.733
I find your number
a little bit insulting.

36:39.766 --> 36:42.769
Take the listing
off the market.

36:42.802 --> 36:44.637
Oh, my God.

36:48.775 --> 36:50.777
(Fredrik)
I can't always win.

36:50.810 --> 36:52.746
It's just,
this particular deal,

36:52.779 --> 36:54.080
this particular building,

36:54.080 --> 36:55.415
this particular client
got to me

36:55.448 --> 36:58.118
because I worked
so hard to get there.

36:58.151 --> 36:59.886
My whole career, basically,
to get into that building

36:59.919 --> 37:03.423
and to do this
big price point.

37:03.456 --> 37:04.591
It's frustrating.

37:07.460 --> 37:10.096
If I can't get it done,

37:10.130 --> 37:13.833
then who am I?

37:13.867 --> 37:15.568
Human?

37:21.207 --> 37:23.443
I'm sorry, Fredrik.

37:23.476 --> 37:25.578
I know how much
it meant to you.

37:31.551 --> 37:33.653
[line ringing]

37:35.488 --> 37:37.223
(Luis)
The turnout to the Jones'
open house

37:37.257 --> 37:39.626
was not what I expected.

37:39.659 --> 37:41.928
But the people that came
loved it.

37:41.961 --> 37:44.831
I have a client
that I think would be

37:44.864 --> 37:47.067
very interested
in this house.

37:47.067 --> 37:48.501
So ever since
the open house,

37:48.535 --> 37:51.304
Ronita and I have been showing
this place left and right.

37:51.338 --> 37:54.274
7,500 square feet.
Six bedrooms, ten bathrooms.

37:54.307 --> 37:55.942
The people that were there
told their friends,

37:55.975 --> 37:57.410
their friends told their
friends.

37:57.444 --> 37:59.145
We got fireplaces
on the entire house.

37:59.179 --> 38:01.081
I have good news
and bad news.

38:01.114 --> 38:03.516
The good news is that
I have two incredible offers.

38:03.550 --> 38:04.651
[phone line ringing]

38:04.684 --> 38:07.053
The bad news is that
I know for a fact

38:07.087 --> 38:09.589
that the Jonses will not
accept anything less than 3.5.

38:09.622 --> 38:11.157
- Hello?
- Kathleen.

38:11.191 --> 38:13.259
- Hi, Luis, how are you?
- I want to give you an update

38:13.293 --> 38:15.161
on 393.

38:15.195 --> 38:17.597
We have two offers--one at
3 million, and one at 3.1.

38:28.775 --> 38:31.378
I personally feel
that even 3 million

38:31.411 --> 38:32.879
is still a good number
for the house

38:32.912 --> 38:35.148
as far as what it's worth
today.

38:41.554 --> 38:43.390
Everybody that has seen it

38:43.423 --> 38:45.558
understands the power
of this asset.

38:45.592 --> 38:47.627
But it's just so far north...

38:53.833 --> 38:55.502
The market has spoken.

38:55.535 --> 38:57.203
The Jones don't wanna hear it.

38:57.237 --> 38:59.305
People just don't wanna
spend that much

38:59.339 --> 39:00.774
on a townhouse
that far north.

39:09.816 --> 39:11.418
I've been thinking
more about it.

39:11.451 --> 39:13.887
It's a big thing.
Having a kid.

39:26.366 --> 39:29.369
My whole career,
there's been so many ups

39:29.402 --> 39:31.237
and a few downs,

39:31.271 --> 39:33.673
but never a down like this.

39:33.707 --> 39:36.343
It was like
I could see the goal...

39:36.376 --> 39:38.044
and then a door
shut in front of me.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.646
That's the worst feeling,
actually.

39:39.679 --> 39:42.482
It's when you feel helpless.

39:54.260 --> 39:56.963
It was a bit
of a tough day.

39:57.063 --> 40:00.633
You look
a bit run down.

40:00.667 --> 40:01.901
I tried really hard.

40:01.935 --> 40:04.571
From the bottom of my heart,
I did everything.

40:04.604 --> 40:07.674
I poured my soul into it
and...

40:07.707 --> 40:10.510
didn't go so well.

40:11.711 --> 40:14.748
What's the big deal?

40:18.885 --> 40:21.187
"What's the big deal?"

40:24.157 --> 40:25.825
It just puts everything
in perspective.

40:25.859 --> 40:27.994
It makes me more relaxed
just listening to him

40:28.028 --> 40:29.662
saying those words.

40:31.364 --> 40:33.366
[baby babbling]
For me?

40:33.400 --> 40:35.735
Babe, grab it
from him.

40:35.769 --> 40:37.637
- Is that for me?
- I lost something today,

40:37.671 --> 40:39.439
so I need a friend
to play with.

40:39.472 --> 40:42.008
[baby babbling]
[both chuckling]

40:42.042 --> 40:44.978
I wanna be like him,
no worries in the world,

40:45.011 --> 40:46.680
just sit on the street.

40:46.713 --> 40:48.882
You wanna be like him
or you wanna have...

40:48.915 --> 40:50.617
a little him?

40:50.650 --> 40:52.018
But don't tease me
with that.

40:52.052 --> 40:54.654
Why do you think
I'm teasing you?

41:04.631 --> 41:06.499
You don't have to
say that to me

41:06.533 --> 41:08.568
because I'm sad
because of business.

41:08.601 --> 41:10.236
- Business is not everything.
- I'm not saying it to you

41:10.270 --> 41:11.571
because you're sad.
You know me.

41:11.604 --> 41:15.275
I wouldn't say that now
just for the sake of it.

41:15.308 --> 41:17.177
I've been thinking
more about it.

41:17.210 --> 41:18.745
It's a big thing...

41:18.778 --> 41:21.081
having a--
having a kid.

41:25.719 --> 41:28.221
I'd like us to take
the next step.

41:28.254 --> 41:29.656
That's what
I'm trying to say.

41:29.689 --> 41:32.425
You're not going to
change your mind again?

41:32.459 --> 41:36.696
No, I'm not, because
I've thought about it.

41:36.730 --> 41:38.965
It's been a big decision.

41:38.998 --> 41:41.768
So we're gonna have
a baby.

41:46.806 --> 41:49.709
I came and sat on this...
on this bench,

41:49.743 --> 41:52.712
and everything was wrong,
and now...

41:52.746 --> 41:55.315
[sniffles]
Everything is right.

41:55.348 --> 41:57.150
It's really funny
how life works.

41:57.183 --> 42:01.054

the lowest of the low,

42:01.054 --> 42:03.156
you...[snaps]

42:03.189 --> 42:05.191
you get the best news.

42:07.694 --> 42:10.697
It just makes you understand
what's important,

42:10.730 --> 42:13.566
just the good news,
not the bad news.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.603
[girl wailing]

42:16.636 --> 42:22.575
You think you'll ever
be ready for that?

42:22.609 --> 42:26.546
That's actually a lot easier
than what I deal with at work.

42:26.579 --> 42:28.348
- This is nothing.
- You see that every day.
