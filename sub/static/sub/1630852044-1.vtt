08:57.169 --> 08:58.403
I haven't seen you for a minute.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.772
- I know, man, it
has been a minute.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.273
It's been about a month.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.207
<i>- The owners of this
property are investors.</i>

09:03.208 --> 09:04.509
They bought it three years ago,

09:04.510 --> 09:07.178
they've been using
it as a rental property,

09:07.179 --> 09:08.446
and now they decided,

09:08.447 --> 09:10.682
because of the market,
where it's at with COVID,

09:10.683 --> 09:12.551
that they want to
sell it for top dollar,

09:12.552 --> 09:13.918
and they want to sell it fast.

09:13.919 --> 09:15.687
- And so we had
some showings today?

09:15.688 --> 09:18.657
- We've had about a little less
than ten showings this month.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.258
- When you say a
little less than ten,

09:20.259 --> 09:21.660
how many is a
little less than ten?

09:21.661 --> 09:22.860
Give me a number.

09:22.861 --> 09:24.897
- Eight, exactly, after.
- Eight?

09:24.898 --> 09:28.599
Eight doesn't seem like a lot
or enough for a place like this.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.369

showings is... is not bad.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.272
It's not a bad thing.

09:32.273 --> 09:35.740
- Yeah, I just feel that
it should be double that.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.343
We've got investors,
so I'm getting pressure,

09:37.344 --> 09:38.911
so I'm going to be a
little bit hard on you.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.712
- I get it. Would we
like to see more?

09:40.713 --> 09:42.715
Yeah, but some of the feedback

09:42.716 --> 09:44.450
has been because of, you know,

09:44.451 --> 09:47.452
the excess of construction
up in the Bird Streets...

09:47.453 --> 09:50.556

cul-de-sac, I see none.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.224
I don't see any
construction, I don't hear any.

09:53.225 --> 09:56.161
We were pretty much thinking
about we could have money back

09:56.162 --> 09:58.730
within 30 days of this
being on the market.

09:58.731 --> 10:03.335
- That's a really fast time for
a house priced at 30 million.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.336
You gotta realize, there's
only so many people

10:05.337 --> 10:08.840

price range in this area.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.341

yesterday for 2 million.

10:10.342 --> 10:15.346
I put it on... 45 minutes later,
three showings and three offers,

10:15.347 --> 10:17.883
like, that's just that
price point, that's not this.

10:17.884 --> 10:21.586
- Yeah, I get it, but if you're
dealing with 2 mil places,

10:21.587 --> 10:24.389

a bit more on this one.

We're in a deal.

1:02:01.186 --> 1:02:03.421
- The seller's asked
us to keep it very quiet.

1:02:03.422 --> 1:02:05.424
He doesn't want
anybody knowing about it,

1:02:05.425 --> 1:02:07.192

running his mouth,

city we're in a deal.

full well, to be fair,

1:02:19.806 --> 1:02:22.774
that you would be upset...
- Oh, 100%.

1:02:22.775 --> 1:02:24.343
- I feel I could argue both
sides of this, to be fair.

1:02:24.344 --> 1:02:25.743

going to stick up for us.

1:02:25.744 --> 1:02:27.446

making a comeback!

1:02:42.394 --> 1:02:44.263

how we're doing and he said,

1:02:44.264 --> 1:02:46.899
"I heard you got an escrow
with Fredrik on Corsica."

1:02:46.900 --> 1:02:48.734

Amazing, right?

1:02:48.735 --> 1:02:52.471

you to not say anything about.

1:02:52.472 --> 1:02:54.172
- Wait, are you
really upset, for real?

1:02:54.173 --> 1:02:56.274
- You've been talking to
other people, developers.

1:02:56.275 --> 1:02:58.109
We've been screamed
at by our client.

1:02:58.110 --> 1:02:59.812
I didn't even want
to bring it up today.

1:02:59.813 --> 1:03:01.312

- Okay, the truth is...
- Wait, wait, no, wait.

1:03:09.521 --> 1:03:11.756

- Okay, but can I talk?

1:03:11.757 --> 1:03:13.258
This is my house.
- Sure.

1:03:13.259 --> 1:03:15.459
- You're standing on my
property, so let me speak, okay?

1:03:18.980 --> 1:03:20.165

I wasn't, like, screaming...

- Just bullsh... I don't
wanna be a part of it.

1:03:29.476 --> 1:03:30.776

our entire relationship.
