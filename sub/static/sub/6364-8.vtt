WEBVTT

00:02.302 --> 00:02.534
.

00:02.536 --> 00:03.919
- Erin lindsay,
how does running

00:03.920 --> 00:05.303
Your own task force
for the feds sound?

00:05.306 --> 00:06.772
- Task force?
- Yeah.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.407
- That's big.
- Hey, dawson.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.242
I heard it went good
with mr. Roslyn last night.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.410
The guy's a piece of work,

00:11.412 --> 00:12.678
But you can handle it.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.280
- This is what i bring you--
the best.

00:16.283 --> 00:19.385
- My husband, asher,
is really something, isn't he?

00:19.387 --> 00:22.788
- Yeah, you know better than me.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.624
Mrs. Roslyn, your hand
is on my leg.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.792
- Call me layla.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.262
- I'm killing myself
working two jobs

00:30.264 --> 00:34.199
To pay for a house that i pray
you and the kids come back to.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.734
There's no way
i'm gonna agree to that.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.603
It ain't gonna happen.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.506
Look, it's over.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.441
I got to accept that,

00:42.443 --> 00:44.176
But, laura, please.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.078
You're treating me
like i'm some part-time dad,

00:46.080 --> 00:47.079
And you know i'm not.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.280
- Asher, just come back inside.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.381
- You don't make a fool of me.
- Ha!

00:49.383 --> 00:51.183
You did that all
on your own, sweetheart.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.352
- I got to go.
Can i--

00:53.354 --> 00:57.389
- Get in the car.
- No. I'm going back inside...

00:57.391 --> 00:58.791
And antonio's coming with me.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.326
- Look, are you
out of your mind?

01:01.328 --> 01:02.828
- What, that's
what you pay him for, right?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.763
To look after me, huh?

01:04.765 --> 01:08.700
You want to come look after me,
antonio.

01:08.702 --> 01:12.304
- Go on back inside, you whore.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.139
Say "hi"
to terry when he shows up.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.675
Isn't that what you want?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.744
Come on, let's leave her ass.

01:25.252 --> 01:29.121
She was a cocktail waitress
at the admiral when i met her.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.327
You married?

01:35.329 --> 01:37.229
- Going through a divorce.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.497
- [chuckling]

01:38.499 --> 01:40.332
Congratulations.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.369
- Home, then?

01:44.371 --> 01:45.871
- That bitch.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.574
She made me want to start
smoking again, you believe that?

01:50.678 --> 01:53.679
There's a gas station coming up.
Pull over.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.114
- You told me
the first night out

01:55.116 --> 01:56.415
Not to buy you smokes
if you asked.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.118
- Look, who are you?
Jiminy cricket?

01:59.120 --> 02:00.987
I'm telling you tonight

02:00.988 --> 02:02.855
To pull over and get me a pack
of smokes, so do it.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.552 --> 02:33.202
- How's it going?

02:33.203 --> 02:34.853
- Good.
- Let me get a pack of reds.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.159
- Those things kill.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.261
- Let's hope so.

02:55.276 --> 02:59.344
I don't know what brand you
smoke, and i really don't care.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.445
So here.

03:04.351 --> 03:08.387
Hey, you pass out on me?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.890
Asher.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.401
Oh, man. Oh, man.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.776
This is detective antonio dawson
of the chicago police department

03:30.778 --> 03:32.277
Requesting an ambulance

03:32.279 --> 03:35.581
And immediate backup
to 1601 north kingsbury.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.951
I have a victim with
a gunshot wound to the head.

03:46.227 --> 03:46.458
.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.961
- When i realized he was shot,
i got out of the car,

03:48.962 --> 03:51.463
Opened his door,
checked his pulse,

03:51.465 --> 03:53.665
And then i saw this.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.300
Our victim's a diamond dealer.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.269
It looks like a robbery
gone sideways.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.238
- How long were you
in the store?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.440
- I walked in, bought
the cigarettes, walked back.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.958
I didn't have a stopwatch.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.475
- You always do the shopping
for this guy?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.978
- Are we on the same team here?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.613
- Just doing my job.

04:07.615 --> 04:11.383
- Yeah? I'm gonna wait
to talk to my sergeant.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.920
- I'm right here.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.922
Sergeant hank voight,
intelligence.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.490
We'll take it from here.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.827
- Dead diamond dealer
and an off-duty cop?

04:21.829 --> 04:24.630
It's all yours.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.665
- I shouldn't have gotten
out of the car.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.933
I screwed up.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.503
- Just call ed glasser,
our f.O.P. Rep.

04:31.505 --> 04:35.040
Tell him to get his ass down
to the squad.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.041
- Yeah.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.576
- We'll figure this out.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.644
- Okay.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.884
- Hey, al.

04:45.886 --> 04:46.985
I hear through the grapevine

04:46.987 --> 04:50.289
You have a living situation.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.523
- That grapevine named ruzek?

04:51.525 --> 04:54.593
- I don't give up my sources.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.961
- Okay, say i do have one.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.328
You looking
for a roommate or something?

04:57.331 --> 04:58.764
- [scoffs]
you wish.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.499
- Do i?

05:02.803 --> 05:04.569
- Officer next door program.

05:04.571 --> 05:05.537
You heard of it?

05:05.539 --> 05:07.606
- Assume i haven't.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.541
- Basically,
you get a really good price

05:09.543 --> 05:11.510
On a nice home
in a run-down neighborhood.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.679
A cop living there is supposed
to make it safer,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.581
So it's a win-win for everyone--

05:15.582 --> 05:17.482
Except we don't say "run-down,"
we say "up-and-coming."

05:17.484 --> 05:18.717
But look at that.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.585
That is the original brick.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.691
- What's your cut?

05:25.693 --> 05:29.961
- I'm a concerned fellow officer
looking out for one of my own.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.964
- What's your cut?
- 2%.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.000
- When roman gets in,
send him upstairs.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.469
- "please" is such a nice word.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.738
- Just send him upstairs.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.655
- Come on in.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.928
Security footage
from the store

06:02.930 --> 06:05.130
Has antonio
inside buying cigarettes,

06:05.132 --> 06:07.366
Plus a cab driver
parked at the station

06:07.368 --> 06:09.935
Saw a male
in a hoodie approach the suv.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.770
- He might be cleared
from the criminal case,

06:11.772 --> 06:16.541
But the internal one
is a bit more complicated.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.077
Asher roslyn had priors
in antwerp and london

06:19.079 --> 06:20.712
For buying stolen diamonds.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.450
- That's news to me.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.919
- You remember bill dietz
out of the 26th district?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.055
He was fired for just
fraternizing with a felon.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.691
You? You were on the clock
working for one.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.892
- Are you helping me, ed?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.427
This doesn't sound like you
helping me.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.495
- Whoa, whoa.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.533
How do we turn this around?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.719
- All right, as your f.O.P. Rep,

06:43.720 --> 06:45.904
I can buy you two days before
this goes up to the ivory tower.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.573
After that,
it's out of my hands.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.143
Only chance you got
is you solve this thing,

06:51.145 --> 06:53.412
And you spin it.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.546
- And if we don't?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.515
- Best case?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.049
Leave without pay.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.951
The other way this goes is,

06:59.953 --> 07:03.188
You could lose your job
and your pension.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.123
I got to go.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.626
- Thanks, ed.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.694
- Good luck.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.169
- Hey, i know you're going
through a lot right now.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.471
Antonio,

07:19.473 --> 07:22.474
If you needed extra money,
i would've given you the ot.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.809
- That's one of
at least ten things

07:23.811 --> 07:25.510
I'd have done different
if i had the chance.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.578
- All right.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.815
- Hey,

07:29.817 --> 07:32.484
How well do you know
this sean roman?

07:32.486 --> 07:35.487
- Not well enough, apparently.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.556
- Hey, man, keep your head up.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.692
- Yeah.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.494
- Hey, al.

07:42.496 --> 07:46.231
Why don't you draw up
some paperwork for antonio.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.500
- Six months sound good?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.502
- Hmm. Make it nine.

07:50.504 --> 07:54.039
Play it safe.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.141
- Hey, antonio?

07:56.143 --> 07:58.643
Your wife's on the phone.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.145
- Tell her i'll call her back.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.213
- Okay.

08:01.215 --> 08:05.250
- Antonio,
i cross-referenced all the spots

08:05.252 --> 08:07.085
You were last night.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.588
Did you, uh, know
you were outside of a sex club?

08:09.590 --> 08:12.757
- Yeah, the red bridge.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.559
- What was it like inside?

08:14.561 --> 08:15.894
- Don't--don't tell him, man.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.228
He'll be useless to us
the rest of the day.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.231
- I'm just asking for the case.
- Uh-huh.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.999
- You okay?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.234
- Hey.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.769
- Got a sec, roman?

08:24.771 --> 08:26.705
- Yeah.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.575
- How long did you know asher?

08:30.577 --> 08:31.860
- Six months.

08:31.861 --> 08:33.144
- Did you run a background check
on him?

08:33.145 --> 08:35.614
- Yeah, of course.
- Internationally?

08:35.616 --> 08:39.116
- No, why would i do that?
- Because he's a felon.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.188
- [sighs]

08:43.190 --> 08:46.024
I knew this job would jump up
and bite me one day.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.792
- You?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.761
- What do you want me
to say?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.596
Look, i'm sorry.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.198
- Yeah, well,
change into plain clothes,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.266
'cause you're on this now.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.934
I want all your driver logs,

08:55.936 --> 08:57.602
Anything
you got that'll generate a lead.

08:57.604 --> 09:00.572
- Yeah, you got it.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.207
- Layla roslyn's on her way up.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.959
- Life's so fragile, you know?

09:22.329 --> 09:24.780
- Outside the club,

09:24.781 --> 09:27.232
You were arguing
about someone named terry.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.200
- Were we?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.336
Oh, yeah.
Terry.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.573
I had sex with him
a couple times.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.141
- Just like that?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.343
- Asher got off on it.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.613
Why do you think we were there?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.148
- I don't know, layla.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.618
I'm not a pervert.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.220
- So this is antonio dawson
the cop, huh?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.659
- So tell me about terry.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.629
- Just did.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.765
He was just some guy
we hooked up with.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.269
One of...Many.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.706
- That's a real nice life.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.040
- Better than some.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.355
- You don't seem too broken up
over asher's death.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.690
- I don't parade my emotions
around in front of strangers

10:25.692 --> 10:29.127
Just to make them feel better.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.329
- Did you have anything to do
with your husband's murder?

10:31.331 --> 10:34.666
- No, i went back
inside the club.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.936
Remember?

10:37.938 --> 10:42.073
- What was in that secret
compartment of the suv?

10:42.075 --> 10:44.943
- Uh, snickers bars.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.980
[chuckles softly]

10:48.982 --> 10:51.683
What do you think?
He was a diamond dealer.

10:51.685 --> 10:56.221
If i had to guess,
maybe $3 million worth?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.189
- If you had to guess?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.659
- [laughs]

11:00.661 --> 11:02.827
It's an expression.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.330
- Yeah.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.867
So's this:

11:08.869 --> 11:12.370
If you had anything to do
with this,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.839
I'm gonna nail you.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.420
- I'd expect nothing less.

11:45.939 --> 11:46.938
- What'd she give you?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.874
- Nothing,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.809
But i like her even more for
being involved somehow.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.110
- Nadia, call platt.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.379
Have her stall layla.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.415
Atwater and roman,
put a tail on her.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.883
- I worked security for layla.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.218
She'll recognize me.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.486
- Fine.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.221
Get burgess
into some plain clothes,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.456
Grab a covert, and head out.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.890
- Copy that.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.357
- The hell is that?

12:22.358 --> 12:24.241
- Hey listen, i need you to go
to organized crime division,

12:24.244 --> 12:27.412
Pick up a new c.I. Pack,
reliability form,

12:27.414 --> 12:30.315
And a stack of intelligence
progress reports.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.666
- You got it.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.016
- Get a pen and paper
and write that down

12:33.019 --> 12:35.887
Before you make
that damn phone call.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.824
- C.I. Pack, reliability forms,
intelligence progress reports.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.259
[recording repeating list]
ta-da.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.494
See, it's more than just
a phone, al.

12:42.496 --> 12:45.063
- Just go get it.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.233
- Not until you tell me
what you're doing right now.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.400
- I'm trying
to bail antonio out.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.169
- Well, specifically.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.274
- There are ways

12:56.276 --> 12:58.910
To rewrite history.

12:58.912 --> 12:59.944
- Cool.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.880
All right.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.014
Be right back.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.830
- That's a nice pickup
you drive.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.466
What'd that run you?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.802
40 grand?

13:23.804 --> 13:26.471
- I'm not sure.
It's a lease.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.475
The side gig has been steady,
last night excepted.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.076
- You know,
there's a reason cops

13:32.078 --> 13:35.346
Who run security companies
are older.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.849
They know how the game
is played.

13:37.851 --> 13:41.419
Who's in and who's not.
That's why--

13:41.421 --> 13:46.324
- Sergeant, all due respect,
i know what i'm doing.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.927
- Clearly.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.062
And you've given antonio
a full account of your--

13:51.064 --> 13:52.597
- Are you asking me
if i had anything

13:52.599 --> 13:54.866
To do with asher getting killed?

13:54.868 --> 13:56.134
No, i did not.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.504
- You ever bang the wife?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.839
- No.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.345
- Okay.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.413
Good.

14:08.415 --> 14:13.351
Just a little tip, roman.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.889
In intelligence,
we know when to talk

14:17.891 --> 14:20.358
And when to listen.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.596
- This is a great unit, and
i fully appreciate what you do,

14:24.598 --> 14:27.332
But i came on this job
in uniform, sergeant,

14:27.334 --> 14:28.967
And that's how i'm going out.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.103
- Son...

14:32.105 --> 14:35.173
You have no idea
how you're going out.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.947
- All right, great. That helps.
Thanks.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.249
- No cameras at the crime scene

14:44.251 --> 14:46.484
Other than
inside the gas station.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.552
- Ballistics?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.888
- No casings, no prints.

14:49.890 --> 14:50.989
- I want everything on layla.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.457
Phone records,
credit card statements.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.126
- William wells.
Jeweler on wabash.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.395
Him and asher were in business
together ten years ago.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.031
Since then, four lawsuits
have been filed,

15:00.033 --> 15:02.400
Two countersuits,
and mutual restraining orders.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.203
Feels like a good place
to start.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.544
- Wells, stop! Police!

15:16.483 --> 15:17.448
Wells!

15:20.453 --> 15:22.387
It's a panic room.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.589
Call s.W.A.T.,
have them blow the door.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.357
- We can wait for s.W.A.T.
To clear the street

15:26.359 --> 15:29.260
And all that, or i got a guy.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.162
- Fine.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.038
- This a stolen tow truck,
or a legit one?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.306
- Does it matter?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.474
- Not really.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.611
[siren wails]

15:46.613 --> 15:48.646
- Owner activated an alarm.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.647
- Yeah, we got it. Thanks.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.317
- Wells, last chance.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.902
Open the door.

15:53.903 --> 15:55.486
We're with the chicago
police department.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.121
- My ass.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.693
- Hit it!

16:15.208 --> 16:15.440
.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.409
Let me see those hands.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.178
- Let me see your badge.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.247
- Want to see my badge, huh?

16:23.249 --> 16:25.183
Here it is. See?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.117
- Bring it closer.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.118
- You want it closer?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.152
- Yeah.
- Come on.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.321
- All right.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.156
- How's this?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.525
- Okay!
Okay, okay, okay.

16:34.527 --> 16:38.429
- Why'd you run?
- I didn't know you were cops!

16:38.431 --> 16:40.098
I heard about this guy
i used to work with--

16:40.100 --> 16:41.132
Got rubbed out last night.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.101
And i saw the gun on your hip,

16:43.103 --> 16:45.203
And, hey,
better safe than sorry.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.322
- Safe than sorry?
- Ah, ow!

16:47.323 --> 16:49.440
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me right now.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.576
The only thing standing
between him and losing his job

16:51.578 --> 16:52.577
Is your face.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.245
You start talking right now,

16:54.247 --> 16:55.246
Or i'm going to go outside

16:55.248 --> 16:58.149
And leave you two alone.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.185
Come on.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.220
- Earlier today, a guy comes in
trying to move some stones.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.021
I didn't know him,
but i'm always up for a deal.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.391
Except he pulls out
a purple crown royal pouch,

17:06.393 --> 17:10.028
So i know
they're asher's diamonds.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.231
Asher kept that pouch so he'd
never forget where he came from.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.098
So immediately i was like,
"uh-uh.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.166
No way. No, thank you."

17:16.169 --> 17:17.402
And i was gonna call the police,

17:17.404 --> 17:20.405
But then you guys walked in.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.073
- Asher's wife, layla.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.742
You know her?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.410
- Oh, yeah. I mean,
i didn't know her that well,

17:25.412 --> 17:27.310
But i saw her around.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.347
She's a real tomato, huh?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.681
- She didn't come by here?

17:30.683 --> 17:32.550
She didn't ask
about moving some diamonds?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.252
- No.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.221
No.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.457
- If i find out
you lied to us in any way...

17:39.459 --> 17:42.193
- I'm not lying.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.202
- This unidentified male

17:51.204 --> 17:52.837
Was the one who tried
to unload asher's stones.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.440
- Maybe it's one of the guys the
wife was banging from the club?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.058
- Maybe.

17:57.059 --> 17:58.675
- So layla arranged
for asher to get killed

17:58.678 --> 18:00.845
And the diamonds to get lifted.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.747
She sends this guy
to asher's known enemy,

18:02.749 --> 18:05.416
Wells, figuring
he'd fence 'em no problem.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.218
But then wells' conscience
kicks in.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.687
Now layla and this guy
are back to square one,

18:09.689 --> 18:10.855
Looking to move those stones.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.590
- Bring layla back in?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.326
- No, i don't want her to know
we're looking at her.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.462
Not until right before
i put the cuffs on her ass.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.163
Anything on layla's phone
or credit cards?

18:19.165 --> 18:20.665
- Slow going.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.867
Once the state's attorney found
out who was representing her,

18:22.869 --> 18:25.103
They've been all over my ass
about motive and probable cause.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.204
I'm gonna get there.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.338
It's just gonna take
another day.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.573
- All right.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.741
Guys, the sex club's a no-go.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.144
Judge kalke refuses to sign
any kind of subpoena

18:33.146 --> 18:34.178
For membership info.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.647
He claims that
it's too intrusive

18:36.649 --> 18:39.350
And too broad to obtain it
for the whole club.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.451
- Screw the warrant.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.288
Let's take it undercover.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.257
- All right.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.127
Any volunteers?
- All right, no.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.262
I've been running and getting
paperwork all morning.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.431
I think i'm due.
- Pssh.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.133
- It's got to be a couple.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.200
Halstead and lindsay.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.869
- [sighs]

19:02.909 --> 19:05.843
- Look,

19:05.844 --> 19:08.778
Whatever we got to do to come
across convincingly in there?

19:08.781 --> 19:09.881
I'm prepared.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.482
- So noble.
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.550
- Get out of here.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.556
- Damn.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.241
Her husband just died.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.925
She already getting her nails
done.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.562
- If you died, i'd wait at least
a week to get a mani-pedi.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.430
- That's cold, burgess.
- [chuckles]

19:26.432 --> 19:29.367
- It's like
we were never partners.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.202
You know, voight's been
using you a lot lately.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.571
He's probably thinking
about moving you up.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.805
- Um, yeah.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.208
I'm not sure i'm interested.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.543
- Roman hasn't been
getting in your ear

19:38.545 --> 19:39.810
About staying in patrol,
has he?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.913
- Leave roman alone.
He's real police.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.714
- He got us in a real mess
is what he did.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.916
- And what was he supposed
to do?

19:44.918 --> 19:46.951
Contact interpol to see if asher

19:46.953 --> 19:50.521
Had any priors
in "kerplakistan"?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.423
No other cop
with a security side business

19:52.425 --> 19:54.425
Has ever done that, ever.

19:54.427 --> 19:58.629
So why are people
jumping down sean's throat?

19:58.631 --> 19:59.931
- Kerplakistan?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.337
- Okay, there she goes.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.752
- Man, this is the assignment
of the year.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.322
We're stuck here
yanking our chains.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.857
- They don't allow single guys
in there anyways.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.260
- What,
you know from experience?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.395
- Asher and his wife
asked me one time.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.531
I made it as far as the doorman,
but he sent me packing,

20:33.533 --> 20:34.999
Thank god.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.235
I just wanted to see
what it would look like inside.

20:38.972 --> 20:42.006
- Whoa!
Oh, my.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.675
- Easy, boys. It's okay.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.310
- It wasn't meant for you.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.979
Wow.
- You done?

20:47.981 --> 20:49.880
Everybody put your tongues
back in your mouths.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.399
- All right, there's,
like, a million things

20:51.400 --> 20:52.917
I could say right now,
but i'm gonna be a gentleman,

20:52.919 --> 20:53.918
And i'm not gonna say them.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.920
- That'd be wise.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.457
- Okay.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.858
I'm kind of tripping right now.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.959
- What?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.527
- This is a sex club.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.929
People have sex inside.

21:04.931 --> 21:05.997
- I'll do the talking.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.881
- Did you see that?

21:23.883 --> 21:26.050
See what was happening there?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.318
- Yep.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.387
- Okay.

21:32.025 --> 21:34.525
- How's your evening
going so far?

21:34.527 --> 21:36.427
- Could be better.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.795
Last time we were here,

21:37.797 --> 21:41.332
There was a really hot
white guy working here?

21:41.334 --> 21:45.002
Like, late 30s, muscular,
long hair.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.972
His name was perry
or something?

21:47.974 --> 21:50.041
- When was it you were in?

21:50.043 --> 21:53.411
- About a month ago,
give or take.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.013
- You're talking about terry,
and i haven't seen him.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.081
Take your pick.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.616
A face like yours,

21:58.618 --> 22:00.685
I'm sure you'll find someone
to play with.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.688
- Well, what about you?

22:03.690 --> 22:05.589
Do you want to play?

22:05.591 --> 22:08.926
- Playtime for my girl.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.798
- Taking a break, dimitra.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.899
- Okay.

22:26.579 --> 22:26.811
.

22:26.813 --> 22:30.681
Seriously, no worries
if you want to tag in.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.850
- So what's your name?
- Brian.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.785
And, look, i only have,
like, ten minutes, so--

22:34.787 --> 22:38.589
- Chicago police.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.524
So you know terry?

22:40.526 --> 22:43.194
- Not really.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.863
- It sure as hell sounded like
you did a couple minutes ago.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.631
- Do you know where you're at?

22:47.633 --> 22:49.266
There's a judge down the hall,

22:49.267 --> 22:50.900
The city's biggest developers
in the room next door.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.036
This place is protected.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.971
- It might be, but you're not.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.673
Is that how you want this to go?
That's fine.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.675
Just give us an i.D.
- Okay, look.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.943
Is there a way
we can avoid that?

22:58.945 --> 23:03.447
- You can tell us,
is this terry?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.616
- Yes.
- What's his last name?

23:05.618 --> 23:08.719
- No one uses last names here.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.754
Out.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.790
Go!

23:12.792 --> 23:14.658
- Married? Single?
- No idea.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.127
- Close with any regulars?
- Not that i saw.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.828
- This guy's jerking us off.
- No, i'm not.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.463
[grunts]

23:19.465 --> 23:22.133
- Do you think that judge
is gonna protect you, huh?

23:22.135 --> 23:23.667
Because you make a good mai tai?

23:23.669 --> 23:24.969
Get the marbles
out of your mouth,

23:24.971 --> 23:26.704
Give us some information
about terry,

23:26.706 --> 23:28.272
Or i promise you, your face

23:28.273 --> 23:29.839
Is gonna be on the front page
of the <i> sun-times.</i>

23:29.842 --> 23:33.177
- Okay, he was in here earlier
asking about a jeweler.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.678
- Which jeweler?
- Any jeweler.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.013
He said his fiancee
gave the ring back,

23:36.015 --> 23:37.681
And he's looking
to sell the diamond.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.016
- And?
- And that's all i heard.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.518
But he was talking
to some couple

23:40.520 --> 23:41.685
At the end of the bar about it.

23:41.687 --> 23:44.688
- Which couple?
- I don't know. They left.

23:44.690 --> 23:45.790
But i can ask around.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.192
- Good. Get up. Go do that.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.661
We'll be waiting at the bar
for that information.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.179
- Do i need to know
what's going on here?

24:08.181 --> 24:12.149
- Better you don't.

24:12.151 --> 24:16.020
You're allergic to shellfish,
right?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.822
- Yeah.

24:19.959 --> 24:24.228
- What's the latest out there?

24:24.230 --> 24:27.164
- The latest is,

24:27.166 --> 24:30.000
Laura's putting me through
the wringer on a divorce.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.774
If i lose this job, i'm cooked.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.812
- Well, we're not gonna
let that happen.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.959
- So you and meredith,

24:54.961 --> 24:56.861
You done?

24:56.863 --> 24:58.562
- Well, not really.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.267
She wants me back.

25:03.269 --> 25:07.972
Lexi's trying to talk me
into it.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.610
Still trying
to figure it all out.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.014
- Yeah.

25:29.562 --> 25:30.861
Al,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.898
Trust me on this one.

25:33.900 --> 25:38.102
I know what it's like
to come home to a family,

25:38.104 --> 25:41.772
And i know what it's like
to come home to an empty house.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.678
First one's better.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.081
- Hey, found something
in asher's will.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.287
- Let me guess,
layla got all his money.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.088
- No, not a penny, man.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.857
Everything went
to his alma mater.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.859
- What about the insurance
on the stolen diamonds?

26:01.861 --> 26:03.594
- No, nothing.
And his prenup?

26:03.596 --> 26:04.662
Rock solid.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.963
He kept all of his property
separate

26:05.965 --> 26:09.800
Because it was earned
before the marriage.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.169
- What does a gold digger do
when she can't get to the gold?

26:12.171 --> 26:15.639
- I'm gonna go with
"kill the husband and steal it."

26:15.641 --> 26:17.908
- Or...

26:17.910 --> 26:21.779
Get somebody else to kill him
so she can walk away clean.

26:21.781 --> 26:22.780
- Yeah.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.882
- Hey, that was halstead.

26:24.884 --> 26:25.983
They just left the sex club.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.651
- Wait, wait, wait.

26:27.653 --> 26:28.986
They've been there
this whole time?

26:28.988 --> 26:32.122
That--that's five hours.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.658
Talk about milking
your assignment, huh?

26:34.660 --> 26:36.727
Unbelievable.
- You were saying?

26:36.729 --> 26:38.863
- They got a name of a jeweler

26:38.864 --> 26:40.998
This terry guy
was referred to, anderson narz.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.233
He owns a store
down in portage park.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.335
Opens at 9:00 a.M.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.874
- I broke my own golden rule:

26:50.876 --> 26:52.810
Never fence a score
for a new guy.

26:52.812 --> 26:57.047
But my moron sexual-deviant
nephew vouched for him,

26:57.049 --> 26:58.916
And like an idiot, i listened.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.284
- This the guy?

27:00.286 --> 27:02.286
- That's him.
- You set up a buyer yet?

27:02.288 --> 27:05.389
- Nope.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.790
- Damn.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.776
- How much we talking
right there?

27:08.777 --> 27:10.761
- You got $20,
i'll give you all of them.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.663
They're fake. Phonies.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.732
Cubic zs.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.800
I knew i needed to loupe 'em
before i held 'em,

27:16.802 --> 27:18.936
But he handed 'em over
and split.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.071
- How long did you tell him
it'd take you to find a buyer?

27:21.073 --> 27:23.874
- Inside a week.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.776
- Okay.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.428
Set up a meet with terry now.

27:27.429 --> 27:29.079
Tell him you worked fast,
you got a fish on the hook,

27:29.081 --> 27:30.247
And you're ready to settle up.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.216
- My nephew gonna get hurt
on this

27:32.218 --> 27:34.418
For referring him?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.286
- Get me this guy,
and i don't know you,

27:36.288 --> 27:38.756
I don't know your nephew,
i don't know nothing.

27:38.758 --> 27:39.923
- Then we have a deal.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.141
[cell phone beeping]

27:57.143 --> 27:58.342
- Burgess.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.044
- You still got eyes
on layla roslyn?

28:00.046 --> 28:02.680
- Yeah, yeah,
i'm looking at her right now.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.298
- Stay on her.

28:04.299 --> 28:05.915
The diamonds are still in play,
and she might have 'em.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.785
- Copy that.

28:35.915 --> 28:36.146
.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.748
[horn honks]
- let's ride.

28:40.219 --> 28:44.388

28:44.390 --> 28:47.257
Get in the left lane.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.326
There she is. I see her.
I see her.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.761
- Yeah, there she is.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.195
- What happened to her car
and driver?

28:52.198 --> 28:53.397
- Damn, i don't know.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.086
- River forest police!
Hands where i can see them.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.355
- Step out of the car.
- River forest police.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.790
Put your hands
where i can see them.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.425
- Step out of the vehicle.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.926
- Walk to the back
of the vehicle.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.795
- Okay, we're police. Hey, hey!
- Hands up.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.396
- We're police.
- I'm chicago pd.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.365
- Show me some id.
- It's on my right hip.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.934
Can i show you that?
- You got it?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.970
- You guys all right?
- We're straight.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.471
- Yeah, we're straight.
Atwater, let's go.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.889
- We got a 911 call.

29:35.890 --> 29:37.306
Some woman said
she was being threatened

29:37.309 --> 29:38.442
By two people with guns.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.144
- Don't worry about it.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.348
- Excuse me. Hi.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.415
Is layla roslyn here?

29:45.417 --> 29:46.784
- I'm sorry, who?

29:46.786 --> 29:48.318
- Layla roslyn.
She just came in.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.853
Red jacket,
lots of shopping bags.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.021
- Oh, uh, yeah.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.523
She said
she had the wrong building.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.391
She went out the back.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.403
- Voight, it's antonio.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.838
Terry just set up a meeting
with narz

30:07.840 --> 30:09.273
Outside the natural history
museum.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.574
- Tell him to make it two hours
from now,

30:10.576 --> 30:12.176
And get
everyone else to mobilize.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.310
- It's going down
in five minutes.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.978
- It's not going down
in five minutes.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.514
- I'm gonna put you on speaker.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.550
- You have to wait
for backup, antonio.

30:19.552 --> 30:22.319
- I would if i could,
but terry jumped the gun.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.988
He called narz
and said he wants to meet now.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.557
My sense is he's ready
to blow out of town.

30:26.559 --> 30:29.126
- All right, who's with you?
- Roman.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.528
He's solid. I trust him.
This could be our only shot.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.831
My only shot.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.532
- All right. Do your thing.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.175
- Target's walking towards narz.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.543
- I got him.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.360
- Let's have it.
- It's not all here.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.461
- What do you mean?

31:04.463 --> 31:07.297
- I could only get some of it
for now.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.334
- Gun!

31:10.336 --> 31:13.403
[gunshots,
people screaming]

31:15.341 --> 31:17.407
- Stop, police!

31:34.960 --> 31:36.226
[gunshots]

31:40.299 --> 31:41.298
[gunshot]

31:41.300 --> 31:43.433
- [grunts]

31:44.904 --> 31:46.069
- [shouts]

31:46.071 --> 31:47.304
[grunting]

32:00.286 --> 32:01.385
- Don't move!

32:01.387 --> 32:03.654
Last warning!

32:03.656 --> 32:05.188
Cuff him.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.759
Terry egan.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.329
Assault in '02, aggravated
battery in '05, robbery in 2011.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.665
Two years in leavenworth.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.301
And now murder, huh, terry?

32:17.303 --> 32:19.469
- That layla must have been
an absolute panther in the sack,

32:19.471 --> 32:21.071
Am i right?

32:24.443 --> 32:27.644
- You two met at the sex club.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.414
She started whispering
in your ear

32:30.416 --> 32:34.351
How much she loved you, wished
you could run away together,

32:34.353 --> 32:38.422
But the only way that could
happen is if asher's bye-bye.

32:38.424 --> 32:41.625
- And you started thinking
to yourself, you know,

32:41.627 --> 32:44.328
"why should this clown
have all the money

32:44.330 --> 32:47.297
And the girl?"

32:47.299 --> 32:50.033
- Here's what you don't know,

32:50.035 --> 32:52.402
Before you killed him,

32:52.404 --> 32:58.275
Your girlfriend switched out
the diamonds for fake ones.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.577
- What the hell
are you talking about?

33:00.579 --> 33:03.747
- I'm talking about two people
who had a plan.

33:03.749 --> 33:08.552
One was smart,
and the other one was you.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.187
- No.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.556
No, you're just saying this
to try to get me to roll.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.362
- It's fake.

33:18.364 --> 33:22.232
- Terry, we have you trying
to fence those.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.601
We have you showing up
at a museum for the money.

33:24.603 --> 33:28.572
We have a cab driver putting you
at asher's murder scene.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.774
I mean...

33:30.776 --> 33:34.011
You're cooked.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.480
- Look at me.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.782
I want you to think straight
for me now,

33:38.784 --> 33:41.385
'cause there's a lot
riding for this in terms of

33:41.387 --> 33:43.420
Whether you take this ride
alone

33:43.422 --> 33:46.123
Or if you can lay some off
on the wife.

33:46.125 --> 33:49.426
Do you have any phone calls
or emails or witnesses?

33:49.428 --> 33:51.561
Anything other
than just your word

33:51.563 --> 33:56.433
That layla was involved
in this murder and theft?

33:58.203 --> 34:01.505
- She didn't like to talk on
the phone or anything like that.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.374
She said asher went through
all of her stuff.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.514
- So the only time you two
talked about pulling this off

34:11.516 --> 34:15.185
Was at the club?

34:15.187 --> 34:17.353
- Yeah.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.121
It was all her idea though.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.525
We were supposed to run off
together, i swear to god.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.396
I swear to god.

34:35.607 --> 34:35.839
.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.841
- So she set him up?

34:37.842 --> 34:39.208
- Like a bowling pin.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.510
- Hey, layla roslyn's out front.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.446
She wants to talk to you.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.135
- I heard you have terry
in custody.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.671
I just realized i don't even
know his last name.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.709
- Yeah, he's in custody.

35:12.711 --> 35:17.581
He had some really interesting
things to say about you, layla.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.884
- You think you know someone,
right?

35:20.886 --> 35:24.154
- Why don't we go upstairs
and talk about it?

35:24.156 --> 35:26.890
- No.

35:26.892 --> 35:30.293
I've rented a house
on marco island.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.563
Flight leaves in three hours,

35:33.565 --> 35:35.432
Unless you have a warrant
for my arrest.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.305
- Not yet.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.377
- Here,
phone records

35:47.379 --> 35:49.913
And credit card statements
you've been asking for.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.415
You'll see that there was
absolutely no contact between me

35:52.417 --> 35:54.918
And this, um,

35:54.920 --> 35:59.489
Terry character
outside of the club.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.192
I included my attorney's
information as well.

36:06.298 --> 36:10.534
Oh, i also had my business
manager cut you a check

36:10.536 --> 36:14.471
For your security services
the other night.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.809
I didn't want that to get lost
in all the hubbub.

36:22.781 --> 36:26.416
So...

36:26.418 --> 36:28.618
I'll be in florida
if you need me.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.191
Chicago winters...

36:37.296 --> 36:39.496
Not for me.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.558
- Hey.
- It's no joke upstairs.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.893
- Yeah.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.227
Still just want to stay
in uniform?

37:11.230 --> 37:13.330
- Yeah, never know.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.532
- Roman!

37:20.939 --> 37:24.007
- Sergeant, my security business
is completely aboveboard.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.775
This thing
that happened was one in a--

37:25.777 --> 37:27.310
- Nice job today.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.382
- Thank you.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.026
- Lindsay.

37:54.006 --> 37:56.273
- I've been trying to think
of the last time i had to ask

37:56.275 --> 37:59.609
Someone twice if they wanted
to help run a task force,

37:59.611 --> 38:01.444
And this is the first.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.446
- We've really been
running and gunning this week.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.883
I had to hit the pause button.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.287
- May i make an observation?

38:10.289 --> 38:12.289
- Sure.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.029
- You're loyal to voight.
That's admirable.

38:19.031 --> 38:22.699
But you're catching a rep
as voight's girl.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.401
The longer you stay here,

38:24.403 --> 38:27.003
The more that perception
takes hold,

38:27.005 --> 38:28.638
And you're just gonna end up
carrying that

38:28.640 --> 38:30.440
For the rest of your career.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.512
- I should be so lucky.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.948
- Erin,
you could be going places.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.850
Or not.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.920
- Steve, i appreciate the offer,

38:43.922 --> 38:47.057
And i am considering it.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.558
- I'll need to know
by next friday.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.626
Then i move on.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.934
- Hey, ed.
- Hey.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.803
Congrats
on solving the robbery-homicide,

38:59.805 --> 39:02.072
But commander kelly's
asked for dawson's badge

39:02.074 --> 39:04.507
Until the internal investigation
is over.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.743
- Yeah, about that.

39:06.745 --> 39:09.446
Antonio's been working
undercover on asher roslyn

39:09.448 --> 39:11.881
For the last nine months.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.351
- That's a pretty big thing
to forget, hank.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.052
- Well, i've been busy.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.454
The whole investigation

39:17.456 --> 39:19.923
Just came apart
when roslyn got gunned down.

39:19.925 --> 39:20.957
It's a real shame.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.125
We were this close.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.399
- This true?

39:29.401 --> 39:31.368
- Yes.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.603
- Yeah?

39:33.605 --> 39:34.904
- Yes.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.112
- Everything matches up,
you know?

39:42.114 --> 39:45.415
Dates, cash payments,
c.I. Receipts.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.584
It's all here.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.152
- Was officer sean roman's
security company

39:49.154 --> 39:50.687
Involved with the investigation?

39:50.689 --> 39:55.792
- Yeah, officer roman's company
was used as a front.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.928
Yeah, it's all here.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.064
- All right. May i?

40:01.066 --> 40:03.133
- Yeah, help yourself.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.784
- Chicago pd.

40:50.615 --> 40:54.083
- Thank you.

40:54.085 --> 40:57.153
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.
