00:32.720 --> 00:33.800
Where are you going?

00:34.920 --> 00:36.200
I'll be at the mill.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.760
It's 12:00, people will be here for lunch soon.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
Look, here's the doctor.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.800
He's early. I won't be long.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.280
Go, hurry.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.760
-Doctor. -Mr Seymour.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.720
The storage barn needed a good clear out.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.320
-I don't know, sir.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.200
-DOCTOR: Miss Kim. -Doctor.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.920
No, no. No excuses. 12:30, prompt.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.440
Why has he summoned everyone?

01:23.760 --> 01:25.760
KIM: He said he has an announcement to make.

01:42.320 --> 01:45.320
We shouldn't arrive together. It's 12:30 now.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.560
-I'll walk up, wait five minutes.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.560
-I don't know if I can do this.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.800
It'll be fine.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.800
Dear God, Louis, are you done with that clanging?!

02:30.840 --> 02:33.160
Yes, miss. Sorry, miss.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.120
Well, we can't wait for Nicole any longer.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.400
Where is she, anyway? It's ten to one.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.680
He's not picking up.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.040
Paul, would you be a dear and go and get Roger?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.360
He'll be in the mill.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.720
-Of course. -Thank you.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.680
At last!

02:58.880 --> 03:00.160
DOCTOR: Mrs Seymour.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.800
Oh! Nice of you to join us, Nicole.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.960
And I see you're off the wagon again, how very you.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.680
Drop dead, bitch.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.640
Someone! Call an ambulance! It's Roger!

03:29.960 --> 03:32.400
Ambulance, please. The Seymour Plantation.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.000
If I strangled my mother do you think you'd catch me?

04:24.840 --> 04:26.080
Almost certainly.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.440
She thinks I'm still 16.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.280
Mothers can be a real hazard. Particularly yours.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.000
-CAMILLE: Erzulie celebrations.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.120
Oh, right. Well, that explains it!

04:41.160 --> 04:43.000
Erzulie is the voodoo goddess of love.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.520
And every year

04:44.560 --> 04:48.280
my mother uses it as an excuse to try and find me a man.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.400
She's just told me I've got a blind date tomorrow evening.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.440
-Well, I hope it's not with a man called Roger Seymour.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.400
I think the conversation may be a little bit stilted.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.000
-Chief. -Sarge.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.920
Roger Seymour, 71 years old.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.680
-FIDEL: Found by his family doctor, around 1 p.m.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.280
Yes, he was at the house for lunch.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.120
The rest of the family are there waiting for you now.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.960
Well, there's no mystery about cause of death.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.720
Yes, and it looks like the handle has been wiped

05:27.000 --> 05:30.720
clean of fingerprints.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.120
Chief.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.800
At least we know where it came from.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.440
Opportunistic, do you think? Or did the killer know there

05:38.480 --> 05:40.080
was a weapon there?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.080
Someone who knows the plantation well?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.560
You seen this?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.920
-Clean, freshly broken.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.640
RICHARD: It's not watch glass, it's too big.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.120
-Could be.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.840
Why would he be using a torch in here

06:03.880 --> 06:07.680
-Hasn't been used

06:03.880 --> 06:07.680
since the '80s.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.440
These days, all the sugar cane goes to a new mill

06:07.720 --> 06:11.440
on the other side of the island.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.120
The Seymours have had a set-up here for 300 years.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.600
RICHARD: You seem to know a lot about it.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.240
I had family who used to work here.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.520
-My grandfather used to tell me stories.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.320
Hard times, mostly.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.280
They didn't treat their workers very well.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.880
It was a hangover from when they used slaves.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.960
Time moved on, they didn't.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.960
Some people thought that the Seymours were devils, you know?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.360
That they could appear out of thin air to catch you

06:36.400 --> 06:37.880
if you wasn't working hard enough.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.160
Interesting concept.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.160
-Wait!

06:41.200 --> 06:46.200
This is where the 50 slaves disappeared.

06:41.200 --> 06:46.200
-1820

06:46.240 --> 06:48.440
-Yes, I've heard about this.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.240
Every slave on the plantation.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.720
They were all locked up for the night

06:51.760 --> 06:54.280
and, the next morning, they'd all vanished.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.840
Never to be seen again.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.440
You know, even if they turned out the lights

07:00.440 --> 07:03.440
and closed the door,

07:03.480 --> 07:04.880
the killer still wouldn't have needed it.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.400
-The torch.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.440
-It's so bright in there. -Oh.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.920
Still, as you say,

07:13.960 --> 07:16.160
means of death should be pretty straightforward.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.120
A machete sticking straight out of his back

07:18.160 --> 07:20.920
should point them in the right direction.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.720
The victim was very rich, by all accounts,

07:22.760 --> 07:25.240
so let's concentrate on who benefits most from his death.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.240
-It's quite a physical murder, though.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.240
-RICHARD: Go on.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.720
Well, I imagine it's difficult

07:29.760 --> 07:32.440
to plunge a machete into someone's back.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.000
It must take passion or anger.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.720
So, perhaps this wasn't about money?

07:39.760 --> 07:43.000
RICHARD: Perhaps he wasn't too popular with his workers?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.480
Right! Well, time to talk to the family, I think.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.400
-Yes. The main house

07:48.880 --> 07:52.400
is up there.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.560
Very impressive.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
Hello, I'm Dr Johnson. It was me who called you.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.960
Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.680
Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey. Hi.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.480
-Yes.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.480
-Yes, we all were.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.760
Roger said he had an announcement to make.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.880
-No.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.320
-Yes.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.360
The mill was something of a passion of his.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.480
He was planning to restore it,

08:32.520 --> 08:35.040
wanted to open it to the public as a museum.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.440
And Mr Seymour was with you here at the house

08:35.080 --> 08:37.440
till what time?

08:37.480 --> 08:39.040
Around noon.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.360
-Yes.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.160
But everyone was already here,

08:44.200 --> 08:47.760
so Kim asked me to go and get him.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.760
And that's when I found him.

08:49.800 --> 08:56.080
-Kim Neville. Roger's...

08:49.800 --> 08:56.080
young lady.

08:56.120 --> 09:01.080
-That's Alex, Roger's nephew.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.360
That's Louis, he works here.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.640
Roger took something of a shine to him, treated him like a son.

09:06.680 --> 09:12.160
-And that's Nicole, Roger's ex-wife.

09:06.680 --> 09:12.160
But, er...

09:12.200 --> 09:15.680
Yes, I can see how that might seem strange to other people,

09:15.720 --> 09:17.760
ex-wife and a new partner at the same lunch.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.040
But it was all very amicable.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.680
KIM: For heaven's sake, have you no shame?!

09:22.720 --> 09:24.760
NICOLE: Oh! You can talk!

09:27.960 --> 09:29.680
-Yes. -So I see.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.760
Can you tell me what time you discovered Mr Seymour's body?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.440
Yes. It was 12:53.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.720
I'm a doctor, it's a force of habit.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.200
So between noon, when he left to go to the mill, and 12:53,

09:41.240 --> 09:44.440
when you discovered his body, everyone was still at the house?

09:44.480 --> 09:46.120
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.400
Hold on, hold on. Wait a minute, wait.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.840
Oh, what now?

10:06.240 --> 10:08.320
His index finger, look.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.680
There's blood on it.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.880
Fidel, the man has a machete in his back.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.360
-There's blood everywhere. -Yes, yes, but not on his hands,

10:16.920 --> 10:20.360
Dwayne. Look.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.040
Just on the tip of the finger.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.160
Could I ask how long you and Mr Seymour have been together?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.920
Almost a year.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.280
We became close when I helped him through his divorce.

10:37.320 --> 10:42.440
Actually, Uncle Roger left Aunt Nicole for her.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.920
Well, their marriage was on the rocks. He confided in me.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.680
I'm sure he did.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.400
-KIM: I know what you're thinking.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.320
A woman dating a rich man twice her age.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.920
But it wasn't like that.

10:56.960 --> 11:03.440
I loved Roger. He was the only man who saw the person inside.

11:04.880 --> 11:10.040
-He respected me. -Where were you between

11:04.880 --> 11:10.040
noon and 1 p.m.?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.400
-KIM: I was here, on the veranda.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.160
I may have gone in the house for a moment, I'm not sure.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.800
But, I was here with everyone else.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.720
I hope you're not suggesting...

11:21.360 --> 11:22.840
It's just procedure.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.440
Between the time that Roger left

11:24.480 --> 11:26.600
and when Dr Johnson discovered his body,

11:26.640 --> 11:29.080
-Yes.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.600
I wasn't at the house, sir.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.680
I was cleaning the storage barn, there.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.080
But I was outside and I could still see everybody.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.960
Wait. Alex wasn't here. He was late.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.920
He didn't arrive until 12:30 and Nicole was even later.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.640
I was at the Harbour gym,

11:44.680 --> 11:47.480
got held up a bit. I don't know about Nicole.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.320
-I took her upstairs.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.360
She was a little emotional.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.800
Emotional as a newt.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.600
-Her husband has just been found dead!

11:54.840 --> 11:57.600
-Ex-husband.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.200
Right, well,

12:01.240 --> 12:05.960
I think we had better leave you alone to grieve.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.760
Actually, one last question.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.160
We understand Mr Seymour was going to make an announcement,

12:11.200 --> 12:12.480
does anyone know what that was?

12:14.080 --> 12:17.120
-He was going to announce our engagement.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.120
!

12:17.160 --> 12:19.000
We'd talked about it. What else could it be?

12:19.040 --> 12:21.760
-He'd never marry you. -We were together, Alex.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.400
He loved me, whether you like it or not.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.400
And I know, Roger,

12:25.440 --> 12:27.960
it's Erzulie week, he would have thought it perfect.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.920
Erzulie is the voodoo goddess of love.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.560
Ah, right. Well, we may need to

12:34.160 --> 12:37.560
speak to you all again later.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.280
Including Mrs Seymour, when she's, you know, fully rested.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.440
ALEX: Inspector?

12:49.800 --> 12:53.120
It's about Nicole.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.480
Kim would like you to think badly of her,

12:55.520 --> 12:57.360
but she is a good person.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.760
We're sure she is.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.640
Yeah, you and your aunt are close, I take it?

13:00.680 --> 13:03.240
Yes, well, when I was 11 I lost my parents.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.640
And Uncle Roger and Aunt Nicole took me in.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.560
They brought me up, we were a family.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.960
Well, until she came along.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.800
And I can tell you

13:15.880 --> 13:17.240
that, Erzulie or not,

13:17.280 --> 13:20.080
there is no way that Uncle Roger would have married her.

13:20.120 --> 13:24.000
Don't worry. We'll talk to your aunt when she's feeling stronger

13:24.040 --> 13:26.240
and we'll make up our own minds. All right?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.280
Sir, there's something you need to see.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.160
What was so important that you had to tell them, Alex?

13:41.040 --> 13:42.320
Was it that you've been trying to get

13:42.360 --> 13:44.360
your grubby, little hands on his money?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.400
You think he tried to write something in his own blood?

14:06.440 --> 14:08.440
I can't think of another reason for there to be blood

14:08.480 --> 14:10.120
on just the tip of one finger like that.

14:10.160 --> 14:14.040
And there's something else. I could be wrong, but a line?

14:17.760 --> 14:19.640
Was any of the area cleaned?

14:19.680 --> 14:21.320
No, no, I secured the scene when I got here.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.720
But the killer could have wiped it clean?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.040
Or he simply didn't have sufficient blood

14:24.080 --> 14:26.000
on his finger to make an impression.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.720
His right arm was outstretched,

14:27.760 --> 14:30.520
away from the main area of blood, like this.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.960
-Yes, sir.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Fidel, what's Liminal?

14:36.040 --> 14:39.120
Luminal, it fixes on the iron cells in the blood,

14:39.160 --> 14:41.200
it makes them fluorescent under black light.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.040
-Thanks. -So, if he did write

14:41.240 --> 14:44.040
something with that finger...

14:46.240 --> 14:48.600
We should be able to see exactly what it was.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.680
J -Yes, it looks like it.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.880
Dr Johnson?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.600
Let's see if Roger Seymour had a will.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.400
And do a background check on the girlfriend.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.480
Yes, check on the girlfriend.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.920
Let's do a check on the business as well,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.360
see what sort of shape it was in.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.520
You know, whether there were any disgruntled employees,

15:30.560 --> 15:32.080
-that sort of thing. -Chief!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.280
The doctor's not up at the house.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.080
Miss Neville said he left just after you did.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.080
-Better go keep track on him. -All right.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.480
And let's talk to the workers.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.360
-CAMILLE:<i> Bonjour.</i> <i>-Bonjour.</i>

15:47.400 --> 15:49.160
<i>Je suis</i> Detective Camille Bordey.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.400
The police have gone.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.760
What did you tell them?

15:58.920 --> 16:00.200
Nothing.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.520
I messed up!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.960
I'm so sorry!

16:16.640 --> 16:18.400
Everything will work out all right.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.200
I promise.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.360
Are you OK

16:28.080 --> 16:29.520
That's right.

16:29.560 --> 16:33.080
Dr Johnson told us that Mr Seymour and you

16:29.560 --> 16:33.080
were very close.

16:33.120 --> 16:37.680
He was a good man. He wasn't like most people I work for.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.920
He did take the time to get to know me,

16:39.960 --> 16:42.280
said he saw something in me.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.800
-About 18 months.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.560
I was doing some travelling,

16:46.600 --> 16:49.120
ran out of money, came to ask for work.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.280
Some of the workers have been saying that

16:51.320 --> 16:53.600
Mr Seymour was very strict.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.320
He was tough, yeah. You have to be,

16:53.640 --> 16:57.320
to run a plantation.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.920
But he was fair. This morning he said

16:57.360 --> 17:00.920
everyone can take time off

17:00.960 --> 17:03.720
at the weekend for the Erzulie celebrations.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.680
So you can't think of anyone who might want to hurt him?

17:07.240 --> 17:09.520
No. No one.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.360
When it happened, you were here, clearing out the storeroom?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.240
Yes, in fact he passed me on the way to the mill.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.880
Did he say anything?

17:20.920 --> 17:22.400
He invited me for lunch.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.240
And all that time, before they found him,

17:29.280 --> 17:32.320
-No.

17:33.600 --> 17:37.040
Well, Alex came later, then Mrs Seymour.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.520
But after that everybody was on the veranda the whole time.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.920
OK. Thank you.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.640
So, if Roger Seymour doesn't have any children,

17:49.680 --> 17:51.640
who inherits the plantation, I wonder?

17:51.680 --> 17:53.720
His nephew?

17:53.760 --> 17:55.240
And, as he can't account for his whereabouts

17:55.280 --> 17:56.680
between 12 and 12:30 p.m.,

17:56.720 --> 17:59.600
when he arrived at the house, he has to be a suspect.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.760
-He said he was at the Harbour gym.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.760
-Let's check it.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.080
I also want to speak to the ex-wife,

18:03.120 --> 18:05.040
-as soon as she sobers up.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.680
Dr Johnson is back at his surgery,

18:06.720 --> 18:08.000
you want me to go and pick him up?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.960
No, call and tell him we're on our way

18:10.000 --> 18:12.120
and not to move till we get there.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.480
Anything on the girlfriend?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.200
Her immigration files say she came to Sainte-Marie

18:15.240 --> 18:18.280
from Antigua just over a year ago, nothing showing since then.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.720
Last year's accounts on your desk,

18:22.760 --> 18:24.280
but they look pretty healthy.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.800
All right, thank you. What about the murder weapon?

18:27.840 --> 18:33.160
Ah, yes, I was right. The weapon had been wiped clean, no prints.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.320
Right, come on, let's start placing people.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.880
Not many of the workers at the plantation

18:36.920 --> 18:38.640
had a good word to say about Roger Seymour,

18:38.680 --> 18:40.480
so let's start cross-checking their statements,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.240
ascertaining their exact whereabouts

18:42.280 --> 18:43.920
between noon and 1 p.m.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.280
-See if we can place any of them near the sugar mill.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.280
-Yes, sir.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.600
Chief, Dr Johnson will see you at his surgery.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.040
It's not far, we can walk.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.640
-This voodoo goddess of love seems very popular.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.640
-Yes, she is.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.760
Particularly with your mother, trying to marry you off?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.920
Yeah, she thinks my biological clock

19:04.800 --> 19:07.920
is ticking.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.600
That if I don't find a husband soon,

19:09.640 --> 19:11.240
she'll never be a grandmother.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.040
-Yes, in England we call it, being left on the shelf.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.360
Yeah, you know, the last one in the shop no one wanted.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.480
A doll with a broken arm perhaps or a wonky eye,

19:20.520 --> 19:21.640
something about it not quite right.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.400
Yeah, OK! I get the picture. Thank you.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.320
I was worried about you.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.720
I doubt that.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.320
I thought perhaps you might feel happier at home.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.800
This was my home...

19:44.880 --> 19:46.600
for 27 years.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.760
And now it's mine.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.840
Don't worry about making the bed,

19:52.880 --> 19:54.200
I'll have one of the staff do it.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.160
Wouldn't you like to know?

20:05.720 --> 20:09.280
You're just a sad old drunk, Nicole.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.360
Do you really think anyone wants to listen

20:09.320 --> 20:12.360
to anything you've got to say?

20:19.080 --> 20:21.240
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.680
Well, it's not difficult, Doctor.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.600
Just before Mr Seymour died,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.440
it looks like he wrote the letters J-O-H

20:27.480 --> 20:29.640
on the floor, in his own blood.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.480
The first three letters of your name.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.400
And you think I killed him?

20:33.440 --> 20:36.000
Well, I think the victim scrawling your name

20:36.040 --> 20:37.800
in his own blood makes you a suspect

20:37.840 --> 20:40.560
-at the very least. -But why would I

20:37.840 --> 20:40.560
want to kill him?

20:40.600 --> 20:43.160
Hmm, I thought you might tell us that.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.800
No, I mean why would I kill him, when he was already dying?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.920
Sorry, what?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.240
He'd been blacking out, suffering from headaches

20:56.280 --> 20:57.440
and so we ran some tests,

20:57.480 --> 21:00.280
they only came back yesterday morning.

21:00.320 --> 21:04.520
DOCTOR: He had a brain tumour. Inoperable.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.080
He had months left to live, six at the most.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.280
-No one.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.600
CAMILLE: You have to admit that knowing someone is dying anyway

21:17.640 --> 21:19.960
makes it less likely you'd murder them.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.360
You think that's what this mysterious announcement was?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.200
"Welcome to lunch, oh, by the way I'm dying"?

21:24.840 --> 21:26.880
Could be.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.040
Sir, I've done a quick cross-reference

21:29.080 --> 21:30.840
of the plantation workers' statements.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.560
Now, they were all together at lunch

21:32.600 --> 21:34.360
the time of the murder, so I can't see

21:34.400 --> 21:37.040
how any of them could have gotten into the mill

21:34.400 --> 21:37.040
without being seen.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.360
Although one of them did say

21:38.400 --> 21:40.680
Mr Seymour was arguing with his nephew yesterday.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.320
Oh

21:45.360 --> 21:47.240
Uncle Roger, let me explain!

21:47.280 --> 21:50.160
I know exactly what you and Nicole are up to.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.280
And you're sure that's exactly what he said?

21:55.320 --> 21:56.960
"I know what you and Nicole are up to."

21:57.000 --> 21:58.560
That's what the statement says, sir.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.480
-And the nephew was very keen to defend Mrs Seymour today.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.480
-Hmm.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.720
So, where are we? Kim Neville has an

22:06.760 --> 22:10.320
alibi for the entire time,

22:10.360 --> 22:13.120
from when Roger Seymour left the house to when he was murdered.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.680
And you don't kill the goose with the golden eggs.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.880
So, as good a suspect as she would normally be,

22:17.920 --> 22:22.640
we have to say she did not murder Roger Seymour.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.160
Then we've got Louis Nelson.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.920
He was working outside, so if he'd left and come back,

22:25.200 --> 22:28.920
someone would've seen him.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.120
Yeah, and he has no motive. The man worshipped Roger Seymour

22:32.160 --> 22:35.880
and he didn't stand to gain anything from his death.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.720
And this Dr Johnson. He was at the main house, too.

22:39.760 --> 22:44.120
But he could have killed him and just pretended to find the body.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.080
-He had a brain tumour. -But the victim wrote

22:49.040 --> 22:52.080
his name, sir.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.440
The truth is, it's only three letters, isn't it?

22:54.480 --> 22:57.440
We can't even be sure it's a name, let alone Johnson.

22:59.120 --> 23:04.320
And then why was the victim carrying a torch?

23:04.360 --> 23:07.760
OK, as far as I can see, the only people

23:07.800 --> 23:11.840
who could have gone to the mill unseen are Nicole Seymour and...

23:13.080 --> 23:14.800
Alex Seymour.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.200
DWAYNE: He said he was late because he was held up

23:14.840 --> 23:17.200
at the gym.

23:17.240 --> 23:21.040
I checked, he signed out at 12:05.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.840
Well, it's very tight but just about possible for him

23:24.880 --> 23:28.800
to get from the harbour to the sugar mill, murder his uncle,

23:28.840 --> 23:32.800
and get back to the house for 12:30.

23:32.840 --> 23:38.600
Yes. Yet Nicole Seymour had plenty of time, didn't she?

23:38.640 --> 23:41.080
She didn't arrive at the main house until ten to one.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.480
And she's the only one we haven't interviewed yet.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.000
Nicole Seymour?

24:03.680 --> 24:04.760
Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.120
-It's the, er... -Police, yes.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.120
Sorry, would you like me to leave?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.240
I just thought Aunt Nicole could use some support.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.960
No, not at all. In fact it may save some time

24:15.000 --> 24:16.120
to have you both here together.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.040
NICOLE: Come this way.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.200
I understand you and your uncle had a disagreement yesterday.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.120
During which he was heard to say,

24:30.160 --> 24:31.800
"I know what you and Nicole are up to."

24:31.840 --> 24:33.040
Ring any bells?

24:38.200 --> 24:42.120
I was trying to persuade Uncle Roger not to marry Kim.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.880
She's a bloody gold digger.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.520
I know her type, and Uncle Roger...

24:46.560 --> 24:50.920
Well, he was getting old and easily manipulated.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.520
We're his family. We were just looking out for him.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.840
I tried to warn him,

24:54.880 --> 24:56.480
but he just thought I was after his inheritance,

24:56.520 --> 24:59.400
that I was afraid he was going to leave the plantation to Kim.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.640
-Of course, you didn't care about the money!

24:59.440 --> 25:02.640
-No, I didn't. I don't!

25:04.480 --> 25:08.800
I just wanted him and Aunt Nicole to get back together.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.000
I just wanted...

25:11.040 --> 25:13.560
I just wanted things to go back to how they were.

25:15.320 --> 25:19.600
Mrs Seymour, you're the only person we can't account for

25:19.640 --> 25:21.680
at the time of your ex-husband's murder.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.440
It's important you tell us the truth.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.560
-She was with me. -But you arrived separately

25:23.480 --> 25:26.560
at the main house.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.200
I met Alex at the harbour gym, at around 12 o'clock.

25:37.240 --> 25:42.200
-We had an appointment, you see, to meet someone.

25:37.240 --> 25:42.200
-Go on.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.120
Alex had hired a private investigator, to follow Kim,

25:45.160 --> 25:47.120
to dig up some dirt on her.

25:47.160 --> 25:49.400
Anything to stop my hu...

25:49.440 --> 25:52.480
Roger from making a horrendous mistake.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.920
I knew it wasn't a real relationship,

25:54.960 --> 25:56.600
she was just stringing him along.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.880
And the only person who couldn't see it was Uncle Roger.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.200
So you thought you'd show him exactly what kind of woman

26:01.240 --> 26:04.160
-Yes, and we were right.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.840
The detective we hired brought these,

26:12.160 --> 26:13.400
just before we went to the house.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.600
She met that man in secret.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.680
But it was in an alley behind one of the bars.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.280
The detective was moving to get a clear shot of his face,

26:21.320 --> 26:23.280
but he disappeared before he could get it.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.960
On its own, it proves nothing.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.240
Why would she meet a man in secret

26:26.280 --> 26:27.920
-I have no idea,

26:27.960 --> 26:29.880
but maybe she has a reasonable explanation.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.120
Oh! She'll lie, just like she always does.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.800
So you took these pictures with you to the house?

26:35.840 --> 26:37.040
-Yes.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.560
NICOLE: We didn't want Kim to suspect anything.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.080
We shouldn't arrive together. I'll walk up.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.960
I don't know if I can do this.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.040
It'll be fine.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.360
So, after collecting these photographs,

26:50.400 --> 26:53.040
you arrived at 12:30.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.200
But you didn't appear on the veranda until sometime later.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.480
Where did you go?

27:00.360 --> 27:04.520
I, um... I have a drinking problem.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.880
I'm afraid I hit rock bottom after Roger left me for Kim.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.720
But Alex pushed me to get sober.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.200
And I did.

27:18.240 --> 27:23.760
Mostly. But today, when I got to the plantation,

27:26.480 --> 27:27.640
I was shaking...

27:28.840 --> 27:32.480
I knew I'd have to face her and...

27:32.520 --> 27:36.040
I stupidly brought a bottle with me for courage.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.000
And then I... I lost track of time.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.160
Did anyone see you

27:46.200 --> 27:49.280
No. I don't think so.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.040
Camille?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.080
Camille?

28:54.760 --> 28:57.520
-I could have sworn

28:54.760 --> 28:57.520
she came in here.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.640
Who?

28:59.680 --> 29:03.800
The little girl, I saw her yesterday too. I don't know.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.240
She must be one of the plantation workers' children.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.920
RICHARD RECOLLECTING: <i>It's not a watch glass.</i>

29:09.720 --> 29:11.920
<i>It's too big.</i>

29:11.960 --> 29:15.160
<i>A torch maybe.</i> <i>What is that, J</i>

29:15.200 --> 29:17.000
<i>Why would he be using</i> <i>a torch in here?</i>

29:18.800 --> 29:20.160
<i>And where is it?</i>

29:30.960 --> 29:33.520
-Hi, Fidel. -FIDEL ON THE PHONE:<i> Yes,</i>

29:30.960 --> 29:33.520
<i>I think I have something.</i>

29:33.560 --> 29:36.840
<i>We contacted</i> <i>Roger Seymour's solicitor</i>

29:33.560 --> 29:36.840
<i>to see if he had a will.</i>

29:36.880 --> 29:39.240
<i>He did and it was changed</i> <i>only four days ago.</i>

29:39.280 --> 29:41.520
But he said now he's contacted the sole beneficiary,

29:41.560 --> 29:43.080
he's happy to discuss its contents.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.440
-FIDEL:<i> Kim Neville.</i>

29:45.480 --> 29:47.920
She gets the plantation. The house. Everything.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.640
I see what you are! You took advantage of him.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.280
He would never have let the plantation leave the family!

29:55.320 --> 29:57.840
-KIM: You're sick because he left you nothing.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.840
-NICOLE: I loved him...

29:57.880 --> 29:59.960
-All right! That's enough! -And he loved me!

30:00.000 --> 30:01.320
-We'll take you to court! -Do your worst!

30:01.360 --> 30:03.160
-Both of you! -You have destroyed this family!

30:03.200 --> 30:07.000
-I'm sorry, but I must insist... -He told you what he wanted

30:03.200 --> 30:07.000
in his will!

30:07.040 --> 30:08.360
I will never believe that!

30:08.400 --> 30:12.200
Thank you!

30:12.240 --> 30:14.280
We'd like to speak to Miss Neville in private.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.520
We knew they were up to something. But this?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.880
Frankly, it's pathetic.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.600
You know who the man in the picture is?

30:32.640 --> 30:33.840
KIM: I have no idea.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.160
-Well, that went well! -She's lying.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.600
Body language. Look at the picture.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.800
-She knows this man. -You really don't like her,

30:41.640 --> 30:44.800
do you?

30:44.840 --> 30:48.120
No, I don't. But that's not clouding my judgement.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.360
I never said it was.

30:51.880 --> 30:55.360
My father left home for a woman just like that.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.960
My mother watched 10 years disappear as he turned

30:58.000 --> 31:00.240
from a husband and father into a babbling schoolboy.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.800
-Sorry. -Don't be.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.800
That was his loss.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.320
But I know how manipulative a woman like that can be.

31:09.840 --> 31:10.920
It's the little girl again!

31:14.440 --> 31:15.480
Where?

31:23.040 --> 31:25.800
Dwayne, talk to Kim Neville's bank,

31:25.840 --> 31:27.480
see if she's got money of her own

31:27.520 --> 31:30.240
or if there are any transfers from Roger Seymour's account.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.800
-I'm on it. -If she's a gold digger,

31:31.840 --> 31:33.160
let's see if we can prove it.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.320
OK, Roger Seymour's will has to be our motive.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.120
RICHARD: Either the killer stood to benefit from it

31:36.360 --> 31:39.120
being changed...

31:39.160 --> 31:40.840
Kim Neville?

31:40.880 --> 31:42.960
...Or he was killed by someone to try

31:40.880 --> 31:42.960
and stop him changing it.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.400
Alex Seymour.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.960
Either way we can't place either of them at the scene.

31:48.320 --> 31:52.000
Nicole Seymour could have had time in theory.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.240
But it's a bit of a stretch to see how

31:54.280 --> 31:56.960
she could have run to the mill, murdered her ex-husband

31:57.000 --> 31:59.840
and then got drunk, all in the space of 25 minutes.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.880
Virtually everyone else on the plantation

31:59.880 --> 32:03.880
has been ruled out too.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.600
Only the doctor seems to have had the opportunity.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.000
He's also the only one who knew he was dying.

32:09.040 --> 32:14.200
Yet why did the victim write part of his name

32:09.040 --> 32:14.200
in his own blood?

32:15.480 --> 32:17.520
Ah!

32:17.560 --> 32:19.680
And then there's the torch glass. Ohhh...

32:21.440 --> 32:23.080
Doesn't makes any sense!

32:23.120 --> 32:25.360
Does anyone have anything?

32:25.400 --> 32:29.160
OK, so I found an insurance claim from 1982.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.920
A worker was killed using a new machine

32:30.960 --> 32:32.720
purchased by Roger Seymour.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.480
-Well, two things really.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.360
The claim was dropped for no reason I can see.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.960
-Well, I know it's a long shot,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.280
but the name of the victim was Johan Peters.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.040
Johan.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.800
-J-O-H! -That's what I thought.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.000
There must be other records. See what you can find.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.240
FIDEL: Yes, sir.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.000
OK, that's a weird one.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.600
-The bank.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.800
There was a standing order of 2,000 a month

32:55.840 --> 32:57.640
from Roger Seymour's account to Kim Neville.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.000
That's quite an allowance!

32:59.040 --> 33:00.520
Yeah, but get this.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.240
Every month she sent virtually the same amount over to Antigua

33:04.280 --> 33:06.760
until last month when it stopped.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.840
Didn't she come from Antigua?

33:08.880 --> 33:10.240
Who was she sending the money to?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.880
It's a business account, I'm trying to track it down now.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.880
A hit man! That's how she did it.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.200
She paid someone to do her dirty work.

33:19.240 --> 33:23.800
See? That's the mystery man in the picture!

33:28.720 --> 33:30.000
Of course!

33:30.040 --> 33:32.320
What, you agree

33:32.360 --> 33:33.920
No, no, no, no.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.280
Not that, the torch!

33:36.320 --> 33:37.960
Please, not the torch again.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.080
It's the only thing that makes any sense. Come on!

33:42.520 --> 33:43.680
Come on!

33:49.480 --> 33:50.840
Where we going?

33:57.840 --> 33:59.240
What are we looking for?

33:59.280 --> 34:01.840
-Um, here!

34:03.560 --> 34:05.440
We can't place any of our main suspects here

34:05.480 --> 34:09.160
at the time of the murder, because...

34:09.200 --> 34:11.800
well, they could all see each other.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.720
Yes...

34:13.760 --> 34:15.240
Maybe not all the time...

34:17.840 --> 34:19.480
But they certainly would have seen someone

34:19.520 --> 34:21.360
walking down the track to the mill.

34:23.560 --> 34:28.160
But what if they didn't walk here in plain sight?

34:28.200 --> 34:32.400
Whoever plunged that machete into Roger Seymour's back...

34:32.440 --> 34:36.720
managed to get in here unseen. And then it struck me.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.920
What if it was the killer who was carrying the torch,

34:38.960 --> 34:40.120
not the victim?

34:42.840 --> 34:46.760
But why would you need a torch in broad daylight?

34:46.800 --> 34:49.760
A secret entrance? Or a tunnel back to the house.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.040
Exactly.

34:53.240 --> 34:57.840
It might also explain how your little girl was able to appear

34:53.240 --> 34:57.840
and disappear at will. Hm?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.480
Children are like rats.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.840
They find every nook and cranny.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.480
Yeah. So any one of them could have got here

35:09.520 --> 35:12.280
-Mm.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.120
Call Fidel. I want this trap door dusted for finger prints.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.160
-OK. -Right. Let's see where

35:15.160 --> 35:19.160
this tunnel leads.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.640
Are you sure you want to do this?

35:21.480 --> 35:22.680
No.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.200
Er, are you OK, sir?

35:31.240 --> 35:33.080
RICHARD: Yep, fine, fine. Yep.

35:35.640 --> 35:38.160
The existence of a tunnel alone doesn't conclusively prove

35:38.200 --> 35:41.360
who used it, regardless of where it runs from or to.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.520
Thank you. We still need hard evidence.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.200
Dwayne, where are Roger Seymour's possessions?

35:45.240 --> 35:46.520
The things found on him.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.320
Box on the evidence table, Chief.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.840
And we found the original files on the Johan Peters case,

35:51.880 --> 35:53.000
on your desk, Chief.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.280
Thank you.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.520
Oh, and, Sarge, I think I found your hit man.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.760
-The person Kim Neville

35:57.560 --> 35:59.760
was paying.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.240
Meet Annie Neville.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.640
She worked as a housekeeper in Antigua, until she was placed

36:04.680 --> 36:06.160
in a first rate medical facility,

36:06.200 --> 36:08.000
after she suffered a stroke.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.480
A facility paid for by her daughter, Kim Neville.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.400
That's what Kim was using her allowance for?

36:14.440 --> 36:16.520
To pay for her mother's medical expenses?

36:16.560 --> 36:18.160
It looks like it, yes.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.640
Why did the payments stop?

36:19.680 --> 36:21.240
Because her mother died last month.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.400
-OK, that's sad. -Hm.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.120
Wait! What was the mother's name again?

36:27.160 --> 36:28.440
Anne Margaret Neville.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.080
NICOLE:<i> He would never have</i> <i>let the plantation</i>

36:44.400 --> 36:47.080
<i>leave the family!</i>

36:47.120 --> 36:49.160
KIM:<i> You're just sick because</i> <i>he left you nothing!</i>

36:49.200 --> 36:51.960
DOCTOR:<i> Why would I kill him</i> <i>when he was already dying?</i>

36:53.400 --> 36:55.880
ROGER:<i> Some people thought that</i> <i>the Seymours were devils.</i>

36:55.920 --> 36:57.520
ALEX:<i> Uncle Roger,</i> <i>let me explain!</i>

36:57.560 --> 36:59.840
ROGER:<i> I know exactly what</i> <i>you and Nicole are up to.</i>

36:59.880 --> 37:01.320
DOCTOR:<i> They were all locked up</i> <i>for the night</i>

37:01.360 --> 37:03.440
<i>and the next morning</i> <i>they'd all vanished.</i>

37:04.400 --> 37:06.160
<i>Call an ambulance! It's Roger!</i>

37:06.200 --> 37:08.160
DWAYNE:<i> The name of the victim</i> <i>was Johan Peters.</i>

37:11.400 --> 37:12.760
Did you find any prints?

37:12.800 --> 37:14.240
Yes, and good quality too.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.680
How long to get a match?

37:15.720 --> 37:17.520
From the exclusion prints taken at the plantation,

37:17.560 --> 37:18.800
about an hour.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.560
If they don't match the people at the house,

37:20.600 --> 37:23.120
-I'll have to send them away. -They'll match.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.120
Do it in 30 minutes!

37:23.160 --> 37:25.040
Yeah! That's it. Of course.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.400
What?

37:27.440 --> 37:29.200
I'd say that was hard evidence, wouldn't you?

37:31.720 --> 37:33.600
And look at this.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.080
Dwayne, I want everyone gathered

37:35.120 --> 37:36.880
-at the mill straight away, please.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.880
-Yes, Chief.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.000
What about me, sir?

37:39.040 --> 37:42.920
I need those prints, Fidel, and when you've done that,

37:42.960 --> 37:45.400
I've got one last job for you.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.360
You're going to need this.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.800
Thank you for all for getting here so promptly.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.520
I'm sorry about the short notice, but I was sure you were

37:55.840 --> 37:59.520
all anxious to hear the truth

37:59.560 --> 38:02.320
about the death of Roger Seymour.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.360
Particularly as his killer is in this mill.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.320
Two things bothered me after I, er,

38:10.360 --> 38:13.040
saw the body of Roger Seymour here.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.440
Firstly, that it would have been quite a feat

38:16.480 --> 38:19.320
for the killer to enter from the door here unseen.

38:19.360 --> 38:26.000
And secondly, we found broken glass here, very near the body.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.720
Glass came from a torch. But there was no torch.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.720
Just the glass. Why?

38:33.240 --> 38:37.280
First, I thought Mr Seymour must have been using the torch,

38:37.320 --> 38:39.920
but then I realised, what if it was the killer?

38:39.960 --> 38:44.400
Who then took the broken torch with him. Or her.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.680
But why would the killer be using a torch in broad daylight?

38:48.720 --> 38:51.200
And then I remembered something that I read last night.

38:51.240 --> 38:55.280
Very much like in prisoner of war camps during the war,

38:55.320 --> 38:59.080
plantation slaves were known to dig tunnels in order to escape.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.040
Indeed this plantation was famous for such an escape

39:02.080 --> 39:03.440
when, in 1820,

39:03.480 --> 39:06.120
fifty slaves mysteriously disappeared in the night.

39:06.160 --> 39:09.000
So in solving the murder of Roger Seymour,

39:09.040 --> 39:13.440
we have also solved a nearly 200-year-old mystery.

39:19.240 --> 39:23.000
We've also solved a nearly 200-year-old mystery.

39:27.320 --> 39:31.040
The slaves escaped through a tunnel that they'd dug whilst

39:31.080 --> 39:33.280
working right here in the mill.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.960
A tunnel discovered by the Seymours

39:35.000 --> 39:37.040
and kept secret down through the generations.

39:38.680 --> 39:42.200
The existence of a tunnel now makes the killer having a torch,

39:42.240 --> 39:43.800
make perfect sense.

39:43.840 --> 39:48.080
It also explains how the killer was able to enter unseen.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.080
The Seymours must have discovered this tunnel.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.160
I believe they then used it to spy on their workers,

39:53.200 --> 39:55.240
earning them a reputation

39:55.280 --> 39:58.000
as demons who could appear out of nowhere.

39:58.040 --> 40:01.160
But returning to the story of the missing slaves.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.400
Legend has it, the slaves were locked into their

40:01.200 --> 40:04.400
sleeping quarters that night,

40:04.440 --> 40:05.800
disappeared by morning.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.320
The storage barn used to be the old slave quarters.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.040
Exactly.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.960
And you used the tunnel to murder Roger Seymour,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.480
didn't you, Louis?

40:19.320 --> 40:22.520
We assumed the tunnel would lead to the house.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.640
When in fact it led us to the old storage barn.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.720
And we can prove you used it.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.040
Louis Nelson's fingerprints were found on the secret door.

40:30.080 --> 40:34.480
This is ridiculous. I loved him! Why would I do that?

40:34.520 --> 40:38.080
Yes, I know about the tunnel, him did tell me about it,

40:38.120 --> 40:40.040
said it was used by his father to spy on the workers.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.200
But I did not kill him. Why would I?

40:43.240 --> 40:45.080
-1982.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.240
-1982

40:47.280 --> 40:50.720
The year a 19 year-old boy died tragically whilst using

40:50.760 --> 40:52.520
one of Roger Seymour's machines.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.840
A boy called Johan Peters.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.120
Johan. That was what Roger Seymour was trying to write

40:57.160 --> 40:58.560
when he died, wasn't it?

41:01.400 --> 41:03.960
The people said the machine was defective,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.600
that the Seymours covered it up,

41:05.640 --> 41:08.360
so they didn't have to pay compensation

41:05.640 --> 41:08.360
to the boy's family.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.680
Well, that's what people said,

41:09.720 --> 41:11.680
but Roger swore to me that wasn't true.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.680
Yes. In a statement to the magistrate,

41:13.720 --> 41:16.280
Roger Seymour claimed that Johan had fallen asleep.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.360
Almost certainly a lie, but no other witnesses came forward

41:19.400 --> 41:22.080
and the machine was removed shortly afterwards,

41:22.120 --> 41:25.240
-to remove the evidence. -What does that have

41:22.120 --> 41:25.240
to do with me?

41:25.280 --> 41:26.840
Johan had a fiance.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.240
After he died, she found out she was pregnant and,

41:30.280 --> 41:31.600
broken-hearted, she left Sainte-Marie.

41:31.640 --> 41:35.160
Her life was a difficult one. She never married.

41:35.200 --> 41:39.200
She simply struggled on alone as a single parent.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.840
That woman was your mother, wasn't she?

41:41.880 --> 41:44.320
Because your last name isn't really Nelson, is it, Louis?

41:44.360 --> 41:45.960
It's Louis Peters.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.880
I'd say that was hard evidence, wouldn't you?

41:53.160 --> 41:57.200
Johan Peters, the boy killed in the so-called accident,

41:53.160 --> 41:57.200
was your father.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.240
As his only son and in remembrance of your father,

41:59.280 --> 42:02.360
your mother gave you his surname.

42:02.400 --> 42:05.440
But there is one final piece of the jigsaw, isn't there?

42:05.480 --> 42:08.000
I understand, revenge is a dish best served cold,

42:08.040 --> 42:11.480
but why on earth would you work here, befriend this man,

42:11.520 --> 42:13.120
and then wait nearly a year to kill him?

42:14.520 --> 42:16.920
Because you had to wait for your sister to play her part,

42:16.960 --> 42:18.320
didn't you?

42:19.760 --> 42:21.560
All those years ago, when Anne Neville left this island,

42:21.600 --> 42:23.320
she was pregnant with twins, wasn't she?

42:23.360 --> 42:25.480
As a girl, you took your mother's name, Neville.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.360
When she became ill, old before her time

42:28.400 --> 42:29.840
and she knew she was dying,

42:29.880 --> 42:31.400
I believe she told you about your father,

42:31.440 --> 42:32.800
told you about the injustice.

42:36.080 --> 42:41.000
This isn't a photograph of Kim Neville and her secret lover.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.800
It's a photograph of a brother and sister conspiring to murder

42:43.840 --> 42:45.360
the man they held to be responsible

42:45.400 --> 42:47.160
for the death of their father

42:47.200 --> 42:48.760
and for destroying their mother's life.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.840
So you tracked down Roger Seymour, you seduced him

42:53.880 --> 42:56.320
and destroyed his marriage.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.720
RICHARD: You turned him against his family,

42:57.760 --> 42:59.880
convinced him they were simply after his money,

42:59.920 --> 43:01.840
that they would sell the plantation.

43:01.880 --> 43:05.200
That only you understood the legacy of the Seymour name.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.560
Little did he know when he signed his will over to you

43:07.600 --> 43:08.840
in preparation for your marriage,

43:08.880 --> 43:11.240
he was actually signing his own death warrant.

43:11.280 --> 43:15.160
All you needed to do now, was to kill Roger Seymour

43:15.200 --> 43:17.280
and make sure that neither you nor your brother Louis

43:17.320 --> 43:19.120
could possibly be suspected of his murder.

43:19.160 --> 43:22.320
And for that, you both needed iron clad alibis.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.960
You made sure everyone noticed your presence.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.880
RICHARD: When Roger Seymour headed off to the mill,

43:36.920 --> 43:39.320
you knew this was your chance.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.680
The chance for you to exact your revenge.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.000
Making sure you weren't seen,

43:47.040 --> 43:48.800
you headed into the hidden escape tunnel...

43:52.720 --> 43:54.760
emerging in the mill shortly afterwards.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.200
You selected your weapon

43:59.240 --> 44:02.200
and then revealed your true intentions to Mr Seymour.

44:23.480 --> 44:26.040
You told him you were Johan's son,

44:26.080 --> 44:30.480
taking revenge for the years of hurt caused to your family.

44:30.520 --> 44:33.960
You wiped the machete clean, grabbed the torch...

44:35.480 --> 44:37.640
then made your way back to the old storage barn

44:37.680 --> 44:42.080
and carried on with your work as if nothing had happened.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.080
Louis, are you done with that clanging?!

44:44.120 --> 44:46.000
Yes, miss. Sorry, miss.

44:46.040 --> 44:50.600
That was your signal, wasn't it?

44:46.040 --> 44:50.600
You weren't talking about noise.

44:50.640 --> 44:53.760
You were asking Louis if he had killed Roger Seymour.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.800
Once you knew it was done, you could play your part.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.560
Well, we can't wait for Nicole any longer.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.240
He's not picking up.

45:05.280 --> 45:08.000
-Of course.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.360
Well, you couldn't go yourself, could you?

45:12.400 --> 45:14.120
You knew if you discovered his body,

45:14.160 --> 45:15.520
you could be suspected of his murder.

45:15.560 --> 45:19.360
So you sent good old Dr Johnson instead.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.920
But you made a very simple and very damning mistake.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.960
Because you knew there was no way he could answer the call,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.360
you didn't even bother making it.

45:29.720 --> 45:33.040
<i>-Look at that.</i> -CAMILLE:<i> There was no missed</i>

45:29.720 --> 45:33.040
<i>call from you on his phone.</i>

45:40.080 --> 45:41.440
FIDEL: Please.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.440
You seduced him and ruined our marriage,

45:45.480 --> 45:48.040
just so you could kill him!

45:48.080 --> 45:51.840
I never slept with him, it was enough to make him want me.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.920
Seymour deserved what he got!

45:53.960 --> 45:57.960
He killed our father and he sent our mother to an early grave.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.760
So yes, we were going to take all this away from him,

46:00.800 --> 46:03.400
just like him did take everything from us.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.680
Easy, son!

46:06.520 --> 46:08.920
And you know what we were going to do with it?

46:08.960 --> 46:14.320
Burn it to the ground! He had it coming, you all did!

46:27.440 --> 46:29.720
Roger Seymour would have died,

46:29.760 --> 46:32.280
with or without you. He was sick.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.080
NICOLE: What?

46:35.800 --> 46:37.600
Doctor?

46:37.640 --> 46:42.120
He had a malignant brain tumour. He had months left to live.

46:42.160 --> 46:45.000
The announcement I believe he was due to make that lunchtime.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.960
If you'd only waited until after that lunch,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.160
you would have seen him die anyway.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.000
The new will isn't worth the paper it's written on

46:51.040 --> 46:53.640
and you'll both go to jail for the rest of your lives.

46:53.680 --> 46:54.840
Oh, Louis...

47:09.160 --> 47:10.360
No!

47:32.000 --> 47:33.680
Most days, I like my job...

47:36.240 --> 47:38.000
But today is not one of those days.

47:40.280 --> 47:41.360
CAMILLE: No.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.600
Well, I need a drink.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.640
I need three. You coming with us, Chief?

48:14.680 --> 48:17.120
You have

48:14.680 --> 48:17.120
another book to read?

48:17.160 --> 48:19.440
Or your lizard needs a bath?

48:19.480 --> 48:22.600
Actually, I was going to say, I thought you had a date.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.960
Oh, my god! I forgot! My mother's going to kill me.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.440
OK, um, goodbye.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.720
-Something her mother set up.

48:31.760 --> 48:33.800
Bordering on the medieval if you ask me,

48:33.840 --> 48:37.280
but, er, who am I to argue with the voodoo goddess of love?

48:54.200 --> 48:56.160
Oh, Michael, sorry.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.440
-You're late. -Five minutes.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.160
It still creates a bad impression.

49:07.680 --> 49:10.320
But you look beautiful, I'm sure he'll forgive you.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.240
OK, is he here?

49:12.280 --> 49:15.720
On the patio. Go and say hello.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.120
<i> <i>-Yes!</i></i>

49:44.360 --> 49:46.320
Camille?

49:46.360 --> 49:50.520
Oh! Good lord, you look stunning.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.840
Thank you.

49:53.880 --> 49:57.560
Um... this is a bit of a surprise.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.840
I, er, I wasn't expecting...

49:59.880 --> 50:01.120
No. Quite. It was your mother's idea.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.160
I don't know if you've noticed,

50:06.200 --> 50:08.520
but she's quite difficult to say no to.

50:09.680 --> 50:10.840
Yes, I have.

50:14.440 --> 50:17.520
Um, I think I'll have a cocktail.

50:17.560 --> 50:19.200
Oh, right!

50:21.600 --> 50:24.000
Only I thought you had a date.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.280
What's going on?

50:30.720 --> 50:33.800
Your mother arranged for me to babysit baby Rosie

50:33.840 --> 50:35.200
for Fidel and Juliet,

50:35.240 --> 50:37.800
so they could go for a romantic meal together and...

50:37.840 --> 50:40.000
I agreed, subject to certain conditions, such as they were

50:40.040 --> 50:42.840
home by 10:00 and she sleeps the whole time that I'm there.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.800
So basically less babysitting,

50:45.840 --> 50:49.040
more reading a book in someone's house.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.720
Haven't you had enough work for one day?

50:51.760 --> 50:54.200
It's rude to keep your date waiting.

50:57.320 --> 51:00.160
Well, er, we'd better be going. I, um, hope you...

51:01.800 --> 51:03.720
-you know, have a nice time. -Yes...

51:05.160 --> 51:08.240
-See you.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.960
I've said a prayer to Erzulie for you.
