WEBVTT

00:07.087 --> 00:09.053
Were you a good mother?

00:09.055 --> 00:12.326
I... I did the best I could. Please...

00:12.328 --> 00:16.352
How does a good mother let
her boy get taken by a maniac?

00:16.925 --> 00:18.954
Let us see James.

00:18.956 --> 00:20.622
Not until you answer my questions.

00:20.624 --> 00:23.924
The scar on the back of James'
head, how did he get that?

00:25.329 --> 00:27.129
I know this is excruciating,
but the longer we keep

00:27.131 --> 00:28.663
the kidnapper talking,
the better chance we have

00:28.665 --> 00:30.165
to find some kind of leverage.

00:36.974 --> 00:38.740
Uh, we were playing baseball.

00:38.742 --> 00:41.233
He took a pitch, turned his head.

00:41.879 --> 00:43.512
It was an accident.

00:43.514 --> 00:45.739
Then why were Child Services called?

00:45.741 --> 00:48.016
He was mad at me, so he called them.

00:48.018 --> 00:52.521
Mad? Anything to do with you
banging the former housekeeper?

00:52.523 --> 00:54.055
You son of a bitch.

00:54.057 --> 00:56.258
That's enough. Give me back my boy.

00:56.260 --> 00:57.325
Hello.

00:57.327 --> 00:58.560
My name's Eric Beaumont.

00:58.562 --> 01:00.195
- I said no police.
- I'm not.

01:00.197 --> 01:01.696
I'm a negotiator.

01:01.698 --> 01:03.064
In exchange for James's life,

01:03.066 --> 01:04.798
I'm willing to get you whatever you want.

01:05.769 --> 01:07.769
First, I need to know
that James is alive.

01:08.218 --> 01:10.105
Alive? Okay.

01:10.107 --> 01:12.874
I'll show you alive.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:26.857 --> 01:28.323
<i>They're rich.</i>

01:28.325 --> 01:31.124
Why not just ask for the money
and be done with it?

01:31.126 --> 01:33.562
Well, the guy's an emotional sadist.

01:33.564 --> 01:36.865
Takes pleasure in their suffering.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.767
Seems to be going around.

01:38.769 --> 01:41.293
Everywhere I look these days,
there's another maniac.

01:45.342 --> 01:49.429
Hey. What's going on? Talk to me.

01:50.219 --> 01:51.813
It's my mom's birthday.

01:53.305 --> 01:54.783
Low tolerance for sociopaths

01:54.785 --> 01:56.117
today, I guess.

01:56.119 --> 01:57.522
I should've remembered. I'm sorry.

01:57.524 --> 01:58.977
It's okay.

02:00.591 --> 02:03.124
- You know what I think?
- What?

02:07.917 --> 02:09.568
I think your mom would've liked me.

02:11.902 --> 02:15.337
Me, too. Come here.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.508
<i>You were right, Eric.</i>

02:19.510 --> 02:22.225
This behavior is way too
specific to be random.

02:22.227 --> 02:24.179
The kidnapper's M.O.

02:24.181 --> 02:26.047
fits a one Vincent Keough.

02:26.049 --> 02:27.115
Wait. The Blue Blood Killer?

02:27.117 --> 02:29.351
You know him? I studied him in school.

02:29.353 --> 02:34.122
Matter of fact, he's
from here, Connecticut.

02:34.124 --> 02:35.285
This side, or the other side?

02:35.287 --> 02:39.094
The other. He grew up poor,
then became rich

02:39.096 --> 02:40.929
and began targeting one percenters.

02:40.931 --> 02:42.994
Killing... abducting...

02:42.996 --> 02:45.047
their firstborn sons.

02:45.049 --> 02:46.668
- Like our James.
- Hey, Zara,

02:46.670 --> 02:47.937
isn't Keough...

02:47.939 --> 02:50.105
Serving five consecutive life sentences

02:50.107 --> 02:51.706
at Osborn Correctional? Yeah.

02:51.708 --> 02:52.974
So this is what?

02:52.976 --> 02:54.541
Some kind of copycat?

02:54.543 --> 02:55.944
What, some random person?

02:55.946 --> 02:57.812
Wh-What the hell do they want with us?

02:57.814 --> 02:59.214
Ben, whoever's behind this isn't looking

02:59.216 --> 03:00.782
to just punish you and your wife.

03:00.784 --> 03:02.284
He's hoping to wear you down.

03:02.286 --> 03:04.152
There's a big demand coming,
I can feel it.

03:04.154 --> 03:05.954
You need to be clear-headed, okay?

03:08.826 --> 03:10.204
Let's talk to Keough.

03:10.674 --> 03:12.193
Might give us some kind of insight

03:12.195 --> 03:13.276
into who we're dealing with.

03:13.278 --> 03:14.709
Yeah, we're wasting time.

03:14.711 --> 03:16.264
Keough's a master manipulator.

03:16.266 --> 03:18.133
This guy loves the attention.

03:18.135 --> 03:19.901
Zara, who put Keough in jail?

03:19.903 --> 03:21.670
Mmm...

03:22.806 --> 03:25.439
A Detective Colton Meyers.

03:25.441 --> 03:27.442
Maybe we should talk to him first,

03:27.444 --> 03:29.911
get a better understanding
of who Vincent Keough was

03:29.913 --> 03:31.313
when he was active.

03:31.315 --> 03:33.582
I'll have him meet you
outside the prison.

03:50.861 --> 03:58.875
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:04.108 --> 04:05.878
Vincent Keough was a financial advisor.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.437
Made some real money for his clients

04:07.437 --> 04:09.637
before he started killing their sons.

04:09.639 --> 04:10.771
How'd you catch him?

04:10.773 --> 04:13.174
Got sloppy, abducted a kid
in broad daylight.

04:13.176 --> 04:15.376
His own girlfriend called it in.

04:18.348 --> 04:20.748
Keough was patient, methodical.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.450
Why'd he suddenly switch up his M.O.?

04:22.452 --> 04:25.248
He thought we were
getting close. Panicked.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.155
Where was James Smith abducted?

04:28.157 --> 04:29.957
Opening of a new wing of a hospital

04:29.959 --> 04:31.659
donated by his parents.

04:31.661 --> 04:34.161
Yeah, your copycat has done his homework.

04:34.163 --> 04:35.765
That's Keough's kind of party.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.118
Any last words?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.534
Keough will see any attempt
to manipulate a mile away,

04:39.536 --> 04:42.169
so try active listening.
Let his ego come to you.

04:42.171 --> 04:44.165
Thank you for your help, Detective.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.973
One last thing...

04:45.975 --> 04:47.975
as I was taking Keough into custody,

04:47.977 --> 04:50.816
he jammed a pen into
that kid's femoral artery.

04:51.648 --> 04:53.860
He was caught, he still did it.

04:54.384 --> 04:58.653
Kid died in my arms. Whatever you need.

05:20.076 --> 05:22.009
Hmm. Eric,

05:22.011 --> 05:24.178
image and sound are up.

05:39.996 --> 05:42.063
Mr. Keough?

05:42.065 --> 05:44.498
My name's Eric Beaumont.
I'm a negotiator.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.204
You mind if we talk?

05:47.236 --> 05:48.669
A negotiator.

05:49.374 --> 05:50.905
How fun.

05:50.907 --> 05:54.175
Usually, they send psychologists
to pick my brain.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.344
Green thumb?

05:56.346 --> 06:00.218
Mm, more like a penchant
for the misunderstood.

06:01.084 --> 06:03.117
<i>Solanum nigrum.</i>

06:03.119 --> 06:05.098
Black nightshade.

06:05.655 --> 06:08.456
But for the likeness of
its cousin, deadly nightshade,

06:08.458 --> 06:11.325
which in large doses can cause
temporary paralysis

06:11.327 --> 06:13.014
and even death,

06:13.016 --> 06:14.929
it's completely harmless.

06:14.931 --> 06:17.062
I think you may have a copycat as well.

06:17.651 --> 06:19.500
A boy has been taken and the kidnapper

06:19.502 --> 06:23.304
borrowed your M.O. Any thoughts?

06:23.306 --> 06:25.006
Tell him to get his own schtick.

06:25.008 --> 06:26.574
Anyone contact you recently?

06:26.576 --> 06:28.876
- Ask you about your crimes?
- Well, as you can guess,

06:28.878 --> 06:32.313
a man of my notoriety gets a lot of mail.

06:32.315 --> 06:33.514
Oh, I understand that, of course.

06:33.516 --> 06:35.249
How exactly can I help you, Mr. Beaumont?

06:35.251 --> 06:36.684
I want you to help us stop him.

06:36.686 --> 06:39.220
Whoever this copycat is, he's not you.

06:39.222 --> 06:41.389
He doesn't have your education, your, uh,

06:41.391 --> 06:42.719
refinement.

06:44.027 --> 06:46.927
My guess is you'll make
short work of this imposter.

06:49.132 --> 06:52.938
I would love nothing more than
to make amends for my past sins.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.393
Training never leaves you, does it?

07:07.395 --> 07:11.485
- Beg pardon?
- Checking your corners. FBI?

07:11.487 --> 07:13.551
And now he's a negotiator.

07:13.553 --> 07:16.724
But why? Why did he leave?

07:16.726 --> 07:18.459
I'm only here about the copycat.

07:18.461 --> 07:19.860
Eric, the kidnapper

07:19.862 --> 07:22.296
called back. He's on the line
with the Smiths.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.350
How would you like
to make amends right now?

07:26.352 --> 07:29.637
Very well. I only have one question.

07:29.639 --> 07:32.707
- Sure, what's that?
- Who'd you lose?

07:39.048 --> 07:40.414
Thank you.

07:42.185 --> 07:44.485
Detective Meyers, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

07:44.487 --> 07:45.653
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:45.655 --> 07:47.221
- How do you do?
- Hey.

07:47.223 --> 07:49.056
The warden let the call go through?

07:49.058 --> 07:51.274
I think our clients may have
something to do with it.

07:51.276 --> 07:52.960
The governor and I go way back.

07:52.962 --> 07:55.096
Yeah, she spoke to the
warden on our behalf.

08:03.339 --> 08:05.267
I have Vincent Keough on the line.

08:05.269 --> 08:07.637
And a good day to you, my friend.

08:10.113 --> 08:11.579
Are you still there?

08:11.581 --> 08:13.748
How do I know it's really you?

08:13.750 --> 08:16.684
Oh, well, from what I hear,

08:16.686 --> 08:19.620
you're the expert
on all things Vincent Keough.

08:19.622 --> 08:21.956
Tell me about your first victim.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.324
Ah, yes, the Radcliffe boy.

08:23.326 --> 08:25.226
No, after your father.

08:25.228 --> 08:27.294
The deer, the French River.

08:27.296 --> 08:29.196
There was mention of it
in the court documents,

08:29.198 --> 08:30.831
but you never finished the story.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.299
There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.

08:32.301 --> 08:33.467
Isn't there something else?

08:33.469 --> 08:34.802
He's agitated, Eric.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.136
He doesn't want us to hear this.

08:36.139 --> 08:38.405
I thought you wanted to make amends.

08:42.505 --> 08:46.168
When I was ten, I came upon a fawn

08:46.170 --> 08:49.817
and its mother trapped in the ice.

08:49.819 --> 08:51.118
Freezing to death.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.487
Drowning. I saved them.

08:54.059 --> 08:56.394
But while they were
still too cold to run away,

08:56.396 --> 08:58.492
I took out my hunting knife

08:58.494 --> 09:00.732
and slit the fawn's throat.

09:01.397 --> 09:03.063
Pushed it back in the ice.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.167
Watched it sink,

09:06.169 --> 09:08.335
watched his mother drown
trying to save her child.

09:13.709 --> 09:17.111
Look, whoever you are,

09:17.113 --> 09:19.574
I beg that you stop this madness now.

09:19.576 --> 09:21.172
They're making you say that.

09:21.174 --> 09:22.616
I assure you they're not.

09:22.618 --> 09:24.030
You need to free that boy.

09:24.032 --> 09:25.737
But your great opus...

09:25.739 --> 09:26.846
Opus?

09:26.848 --> 09:27.888
What opus?

09:27.890 --> 09:29.440
Maybe Keough isn't finished killing.

09:30.056 --> 09:31.125
Maybe there was a sequence,

09:31.127 --> 09:33.360
could be why he got sloppy
with his last victim.

09:33.362 --> 09:35.016
I haven't a clue what you're on about,

09:35.018 --> 09:36.897
but I beg that you listen to reason now.

09:36.899 --> 09:38.700
You must free that boy.

09:38.702 --> 09:40.695
Okay, if that's what you really want.

09:40.697 --> 09:41.741
It is.

09:41.743 --> 09:43.753
I would do anything for you.

09:43.755 --> 09:46.736
James will call as soon as he's free.

09:49.812 --> 09:51.445
There.

09:51.447 --> 09:53.468
I guess happy endings do exist.

09:54.957 --> 09:56.262
The deer.

09:56.775 --> 09:58.031
Your first kill?

10:02.925 --> 10:05.125
Oh, I did what you asked.

10:05.127 --> 10:07.261
My regrettable encounter
with Mother Nature

10:07.263 --> 10:09.088
has nothing to do with your copycat.

10:09.090 --> 10:10.969
I just have one question.

10:12.068 --> 10:13.634
What's that?

10:13.636 --> 10:15.135
Who'd you lose?

10:19.308 --> 10:21.642
- Well, that was too easy.
- Agreed.

10:21.644 --> 10:23.577
It felt a lot like a performance.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.112
I think Keough knows the copycat.

10:25.114 --> 10:26.847
Serial killers need to be in control.

10:26.849 --> 10:28.415
The copycat is likely a subordinate.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.783
If he-he went off script

10:29.785 --> 10:31.852
asking to hear that story about the deer,

10:31.854 --> 10:33.854
it would explain why Keough got so upset.

10:33.856 --> 10:36.056
That event is rooted in some
significant trauma for Keough.

10:36.058 --> 10:38.125
That's why the kidnapper
put James in ice.

10:38.127 --> 10:39.760
It's all connected.

10:39.762 --> 10:41.228
And they mentioned Keough's father.

10:41.230 --> 10:42.296
What do we know?

10:42.298 --> 10:44.460
He was an alcoholic.
Abandoned the family.

10:45.368 --> 10:47.735
- What's this?
- It's a holdback from the press.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.403
It's a letter from Keough.

10:49.405 --> 10:50.938
When he killed those boys,

10:50.940 --> 10:54.208
he wrote that he “freed” them
from the cycle of greed.

10:54.210 --> 10:56.076
He told the copycat to “free” James.

10:56.078 --> 10:59.313
Eric, it's James... he's on the phone.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.227
Okay.

11:01.770 --> 11:03.851
- James, just hold on.
- We're gonna find you, sweetie.

11:03.853 --> 11:06.263
- What's going on?
- It's James.

11:06.265 --> 11:07.554
James?

11:08.164 --> 11:09.375
Where are you?

11:09.377 --> 11:12.159
I'm in a coffin. He buried me.

11:12.161 --> 11:14.261
He buried me alive.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.699
- I've got the flashlight app on.
- That's good,

11:20.724 --> 11:21.741
that's good, sweetie.

11:21.743 --> 11:24.080
You keep that on.
We're gonna find you real soon.

11:24.105 --> 11:25.705
I need to speak with your son.

11:26.574 --> 11:28.241
I love you, sweetie.

11:28.243 --> 11:29.709
We're gonna find you, I promise.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.480
James...

11:33.482 --> 11:36.174
there is only so much air in there.

11:36.176 --> 11:37.394
What?

11:37.396 --> 11:39.349
Oh, my God.

11:39.754 --> 11:42.021
I want you to close your eyes.
Can you do that for me?

11:42.023 --> 11:44.023
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:44.025 --> 11:45.725
Now slow down your breathing.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.130
All right, that's it, James, that's good.

11:51.132 --> 11:54.046
Now, I want you to switch off
the flashlight app,

11:54.048 --> 11:55.334
and when you're ready...

11:55.336 --> 11:57.136
hang up the phone.

11:59.505 --> 12:00.424
We need to make sure

12:00.426 --> 12:01.704
that the phone still has battery.

12:01.706 --> 12:02.994
Y-You promise you'll find me?

12:02.996 --> 12:03.834
I am gonna do

12:03.836 --> 12:06.864
everything I can to find you.

12:08.646 --> 12:10.171
I love you guys.

12:15.358 --> 12:16.423
Kid get an ID?

12:16.425 --> 12:18.310
No, kidnapper was masked. Gloved, even.

12:18.312 --> 12:19.994
James couldn't give us anything.
What about you?

12:19.996 --> 12:22.091
No. Something's bouncing
the cell signal around.

12:22.093 --> 12:23.285
It's impossible to trace.

12:23.287 --> 12:24.899
The coffin could be anywhere.

12:24.901 --> 12:26.805
Keough knows this kidnapper.

12:26.807 --> 12:28.035
Who's he had contact with?

12:28.037 --> 12:29.036
No one.

12:29.038 --> 12:30.271
Well, there's Lydia March.

12:30.273 --> 12:32.206
- Who's that?
- Local botanist.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.979
Volunteers with the inmates.

12:33.981 --> 12:36.076
A while back, she and Keough
started writing letters.

12:36.078 --> 12:38.946
Any chance there were
secret messages? A code, maybe?

12:38.948 --> 12:40.180
No, they were vetted by the guards.

12:40.182 --> 12:42.238
Mostly talk about flowers, plants.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.885
Keough's, uh, obsession with big banks.

12:44.887 --> 12:47.521
Might be worth sending it back
to Cri/Res for analysis.

12:47.523 --> 12:50.024
- Has he had contact with anyone else?
- I've just checked

12:50.026 --> 12:51.058
the visitor log... there's nothing.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.726
Except several requests

12:52.728 --> 12:54.984
- for a Dale, uh...
- McNamara.

12:54.986 --> 12:57.464
Yes, uh, to visit, but the
warden rejected them all.

12:57.466 --> 12:58.499
Who's Dale McNamara?

12:58.501 --> 13:00.697
The son of Keough's ex-girlfriend.

13:01.222 --> 13:02.569
The woman who turned him in.

13:02.571 --> 13:04.038
Why would he want to see her son?

13:04.040 --> 13:05.673
- Keough's his father.
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.675 --> 13:07.241
Does Dale know that his father's

13:07.243 --> 13:08.409
a killer?

13:08.411 --> 13:10.411
His mother married a rich dentist.

13:10.413 --> 13:12.338
He raised Dale as his own,

13:12.340 --> 13:14.381
but we live in a small town,
Mr. Beaumont.

13:14.383 --> 13:16.260
What kind of kid is Dale?

13:16.262 --> 13:18.085
Eric, you're not seriously considering...

13:18.087 --> 13:20.383
- You just said yourself he's a kid.
- I know.

13:20.385 --> 13:22.356
But we have nothing to bargain with.

13:22.358 --> 13:25.392
Right now Dale is the only thing
that we <i> know</i> Keough wants.

13:25.394 --> 13:26.827
Putting Dale in a room with Keough

13:26.829 --> 13:28.729
could cause a great deal
of trauma for him.

13:28.731 --> 13:29.897
It may also rattle Keough enough

13:29.899 --> 13:31.865
for us to poke a hole
in that armor of his.

13:31.867 --> 13:35.010
- But shouldn't we...
- Coffins are airtight, Maxine.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.805
James could have less
than six hours left.

13:37.807 --> 13:39.977
Look, I will talk to Dale first.

13:39.979 --> 13:41.508
I won't send him in unprepared, okay?

13:43.980 --> 13:45.446
Would you mind visiting the botanist?

13:45.448 --> 13:46.880
Yeah. I'll join you.

13:46.882 --> 13:49.049
Thank you.

13:50.853 --> 13:53.754
<i>Vincent and I are friendly,</i>

13:53.756 --> 13:56.757
but I would hardly call us associates.

13:56.759 --> 14:01.095
I just... volunteer once a week.

14:01.097 --> 14:02.930
I use plants

14:02.932 --> 14:06.567
to teach them about how fragile life is.

14:06.569 --> 14:09.303
The inmates seem to enjoy it.

14:09.305 --> 14:10.971
But you've only written to Keough.

14:13.753 --> 14:17.077
Vincent really took to the plant program.

14:17.465 --> 14:20.241
- He's a changed man.
- Men like Vincent Keough

14:20.243 --> 14:21.515
don't change. You know this

14:21.517 --> 14:22.916
from personal experience?

14:22.918 --> 14:24.685
Vincent's not like other men.

14:24.687 --> 14:26.353
He's refined.

14:26.355 --> 14:29.423
His words bring a great deal
of happiness to me.

14:29.425 --> 14:32.159
- He's a serial killer.
- Having been bankrupted

14:32.161 --> 14:34.628
and hounded by the IRS

14:34.630 --> 14:37.297
while Wall Street runs amok,

14:37.878 --> 14:41.503
I am naturally sympathetic
to his political message.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.576
Men like Keough use those ideas
to prey on the weak.

14:44.578 --> 14:47.307
Because the weak refuse to see the world

14:47.309 --> 14:50.044
as the corrupt swamp that it actually is.

14:50.046 --> 14:51.879
One more thing.

14:51.881 --> 14:54.348
Does he look familiar to you?

14:55.128 --> 14:57.363
Vincent is in prison! How the hell

14:57.365 --> 14:59.420
do you expect him
to do something like that?

14:59.422 --> 15:01.622
I would like you to leave.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.359
Well, thank you for your time.

15:11.853 --> 15:13.634
<i>Well?</i>

15:13.636 --> 15:17.004
Did he release the boy?

15:17.006 --> 15:19.027
Don't you mean “free”?

15:19.842 --> 15:22.709
Did he “free” the boy?

15:23.712 --> 15:25.712
I have the letter, Vincent.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.115
The one that was
never released to the public

15:28.117 --> 15:33.253
but somehow the copycat
has intimate knowledge on.

15:34.256 --> 15:37.491
“Free” means “kill,” doesn't it?

15:39.839 --> 15:42.096
- You're grasping.
- Come on, Keough.

15:42.098 --> 15:43.760
You know the copycat.

15:45.094 --> 15:47.267
He knew about the opus, the deer.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.336
End this now.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.143
Is that all you have?

15:56.145 --> 15:57.978
Am I to falter

15:57.980 --> 15:59.813
under your pathetic plea
to save James Smith?

15:59.815 --> 16:02.528
No. Not mine.

16:04.771 --> 16:05.886
His.

16:09.825 --> 16:11.621
Vincent Keough...

16:12.695 --> 16:17.168
this is Dale McNamara.

16:26.143 --> 16:28.863
This son I know who he is.

16:30.927 --> 16:33.420
I wanted to be the one to
tell the truth about me.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.749
Like your heartless
mother build me to it.

16:38.938 --> 16:40.683
My mother didn't tell me anything.

16:40.685 --> 16:42.456
It's a small town...
the other kids couldn't wait

16:42.458 --> 16:43.857
to torment me about my dad

16:43.859 --> 16:45.159
the serial killer.

16:45.161 --> 16:46.426
Before we go any further...

16:46.428 --> 16:48.629
- I am not a killer.
- Dale,

16:48.631 --> 16:50.364
is there something
you'd like to ask your father?

16:50.366 --> 16:52.534
- I am a prophet.
- Dale...

16:52.536 --> 16:53.863
- A revolutionary.
- Dale...

16:53.865 --> 16:56.566
A divining rod pointing
to where the truth

16:56.568 --> 16:58.105
- is buried.
- Dale, please.

16:58.107 --> 17:01.180
- Yes, Dale, please! Please!
- Where is he?!

17:02.411 --> 17:04.377
Where is James Smith?

17:06.582 --> 17:08.749
Haven't you ruined enough lives?

17:08.751 --> 17:10.851
Haven't you caused enough pain?

17:10.853 --> 17:13.878
Does your stepdad treat you
differently than your siblings,

17:13.881 --> 17:15.155
his real children?

17:15.156 --> 17:16.823
- Okay, that's enough.
- Oh, they think that

17:16.825 --> 17:19.292
you're going to turn out
to be like me: a monster.

17:20.565 --> 17:22.438
But deep down, your stepdad knows

17:22.440 --> 17:24.164
your mother is trash.

17:24.734 --> 17:26.098
Tell me, Dale,

17:26.695 --> 17:28.068
who has caused you

17:28.069 --> 17:30.625
the most pain? Hmm?

17:30.627 --> 17:32.076
Stop it.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.709
I am nothing like you.

17:36.414 --> 17:38.412
You should be so lucky.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.415
Your mother was a parasite
when I found her.

17:42.484 --> 17:44.484
Barfly.

17:44.486 --> 17:45.786
A mattress back.

17:45.788 --> 17:48.388
Breeding and feeding off
of anybody that would have her.

17:48.390 --> 17:50.699
Hey, you think you're so great, huh?!

17:50.701 --> 17:52.125
Whoa.

17:52.930 --> 17:54.161
You are nothing

17:54.163 --> 17:55.495
- Hey.
- but a fraud...

17:55.497 --> 17:56.763
...a phony.

17:59.235 --> 18:00.567
Pull him off!

18:00.569 --> 18:02.202
Get him off me!

18:04.340 --> 18:07.074
Okay, okay, okay.

18:14.535 --> 18:17.351
Aren't family reunions delightful?

18:17.353 --> 18:18.452
Tell me where James is.

18:19.822 --> 18:22.462
I am disappointed in you, Mr. Beaumont.

18:22.464 --> 18:24.754
Do most of the people
you usually come up against

18:24.756 --> 18:26.727
- just hand over information?
- The warden refused

18:26.729 --> 18:28.562
every request you made to see your son.

18:28.564 --> 18:29.763
I made that happen.

18:29.765 --> 18:31.098
Mr. Beaumont, please.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.699
I can get you visitations,

18:32.701 --> 18:35.202
make contact with his mother
on your behalf...

18:35.204 --> 18:38.105
Don't lowball me!

18:43.545 --> 18:45.379
You want James Smith.

18:46.275 --> 18:47.874
I can show you where he is,

18:47.876 --> 18:50.117
but I will only do it in person.

18:50.119 --> 18:52.686
I want out of this hellhole.

18:53.756 --> 18:55.522
And there's the big demand.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.591
What?

18:57.593 --> 18:58.692
What are you smiling about?

18:58.694 --> 19:00.994
We're finally negotiating.

19:09.387 --> 19:11.487
<i>Think the botanist is the copycat?</i>

19:11.489 --> 19:12.788
I think she's deluded.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.590
I think she traded her identity

19:14.592 --> 19:16.525
for the kind words of a lunatic.

19:16.527 --> 19:17.848
You okay?

19:18.696 --> 19:20.196
Yeah. Sorry.

19:20.198 --> 19:21.964
She hit a nerve, I guess.

19:21.966 --> 19:24.116
Your mother's birthday
is hard for me, too.

19:24.118 --> 19:25.554
Keough isn't Delaine, you know?

19:25.556 --> 19:27.358
We can't lose focus, okay?

19:27.972 --> 19:30.640
Lydia is antisocial, a loner.

19:30.642 --> 19:32.508
She's completely enamored with Keough.

19:32.510 --> 19:33.976
She fits the profile.

19:33.978 --> 19:35.658
You show her the photo of James?

19:35.660 --> 19:37.647
She acted like she was horrified.

19:37.649 --> 19:39.682
- I didn't buy it.
- Well, if it is her,

19:39.684 --> 19:41.484
she had to be conspiring
with Keough somehow.

19:41.486 --> 19:43.719
We've already sent her letters
to Cri/Res for analysis,

19:43.721 --> 19:46.589
so we should have
something soon. Go ahead.

19:48.591 --> 19:50.459
How did it go with Dale?

19:50.461 --> 19:52.361
Well, you may have been right

19:52.363 --> 19:53.729
about putting him in a room with Keough.

19:53.731 --> 19:55.064
He's pretty upset.

19:55.066 --> 19:57.471
Detective Meyers is
finding him a ride home.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.474
Why don't I do it?

20:01.172 --> 20:03.039
You sure?

20:03.041 --> 20:04.507
Yeah.

20:04.509 --> 20:07.743
We can commiserate about
what a bad person you are.

20:10.568 --> 20:12.403
<i>We can't just rush to conclusions.</i>

20:12.405 --> 20:13.983
<i>Please, you need to take a deep breath...</i>

20:13.985 --> 20:16.552
No. Look, if Vincent Keough needs

20:16.554 --> 20:19.088
to be let out temporarily
in order to find James, then...

20:19.090 --> 20:20.171
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

20:20.173 --> 20:21.411
You're not getting anywhere.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.619
Why do you think Keough chose James?

20:23.621 --> 20:25.585
- How should I know?
- He chose James

20:25.587 --> 20:27.196
because he knew, pushed hard enough,

20:27.198 --> 20:29.231
you would use your influence
to get him out of prison.

20:29.233 --> 20:30.833
Everything we've done was to find out

20:30.835 --> 20:33.302
what the big demand would be,
and now we know it.

20:33.304 --> 20:34.996
Don't... don't give away our leverage.

20:34.998 --> 20:37.039
- You don't understand.
- Early this year,

20:37.041 --> 20:38.828
my daughter Evie
was abducted by a madman.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.183
So what would you have us do?

20:40.185 --> 20:41.585
What I did.

20:41.587 --> 20:44.613
Trust my team.

20:47.719 --> 20:48.784
<i>Tactic?</i>

20:48.786 --> 20:50.027
Keough can be rattled.

20:50.029 --> 20:51.407
Dale proved that.

20:51.409 --> 20:52.746
And he's completing an opus,

20:52.748 --> 20:54.184
so the location where James is buried

20:54.186 --> 20:55.184
should be significant.

20:55.186 --> 20:56.700
Now, we pick the right scab,

20:56.702 --> 20:58.149
and he may reveal where that is.

20:58.151 --> 20:59.739
Distributive negotiation.

20:59.739 --> 21:01.072
Call it what you want.

21:01.074 --> 21:02.707
I'm just gonna piss him off.

21:13.186 --> 21:15.653
Ah.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.022
Good tidings, I hope.

21:18.024 --> 21:19.657
Did you really think
that pathetic routine

21:19.659 --> 21:22.259
was gonna get you out of here, hmm?

21:22.261 --> 21:23.594
You really that stupid?

21:23.596 --> 21:25.363
I strongly advise you to watch your tone,

21:25.365 --> 21:26.697
Mr. Beaumont.

21:26.699 --> 21:29.400
Those things you said
about, um, Dale's mother...

21:29.402 --> 21:31.335
the feeding, the breeding...

21:31.337 --> 21:33.004
you're actually talking about yourself.

21:33.006 --> 21:34.902
You're part of the same hypocrisy.

21:35.408 --> 21:37.408
I'm nothing like her.

21:37.410 --> 21:39.431
Trading in slums
for a Bentley and a house

21:39.433 --> 21:40.791
in the Gold Coast?

21:40.793 --> 21:43.047
Yeah, you're, uh... you're worlds apart.

21:43.049 --> 21:44.281
That was a way in.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.314
Access to the people I needed to punish.

21:47.316 --> 21:49.186
Oh, so you followed rich people around

21:49.188 --> 21:51.919
like a sad little puppy
so you could get your revenge.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.293
I was building up a tolerance.

21:56.295 --> 21:59.196
Ingesting tiny bits of their lives

21:59.198 --> 22:01.732
until I could stomach to be around them.

22:01.734 --> 22:03.701
Except they wouldn't
have you, would they?

22:03.703 --> 22:04.829
They couldn't have me.

22:04.831 --> 22:07.638
Because you will always be
that poor kid from the slums

22:07.640 --> 22:08.864
with a drunk for a dad.

22:08.866 --> 22:10.875
And what about you, Mr. White Knight?

22:10.877 --> 22:13.347
You trying to save James or yourself?

22:13.349 --> 22:14.534
That's not it, is it?

22:14.536 --> 22:16.380
Who did you lose?
Was it a wife or a mother

22:16.382 --> 22:18.163
or a lover or a combination?

22:18.165 --> 22:21.118
- It's not that they didn'twant you...
- See, the thing you'll learn, Eric,

22:21.120 --> 22:22.754
- is that when you align yourself...
- ...you were just never comfortable.

22:22.756 --> 22:24.074
- With the rich...
- Because deep down

22:24.076 --> 22:25.890
- you knew who you were.
- ...they will always let you down.

22:25.892 --> 22:28.192
- You hate yourself.
- You have no idea what I lost

22:28.194 --> 22:29.827
at the hands of the establishment.

22:29.829 --> 22:31.531
You think you should be immune
to a run of bad luck?

22:31.531 --> 22:33.163
What happened to my father

22:33.165 --> 22:35.165
was much more than a run of bad luck!

22:35.167 --> 22:36.600
Your father was a drunk, a deadbeat.

22:36.602 --> 22:37.601
Shut your mouth!

22:37.603 --> 22:38.836
Whatever happened to him was his fault.

22:38.838 --> 22:40.037
They ruined him!

22:40.039 --> 22:41.438
- Really? Really?
- Yes!

22:41.440 --> 22:43.674
What'd you see that day, huh?
Before the deer.

22:43.676 --> 22:44.842
Before you became a killer.

22:44.844 --> 22:46.010
You think that your privilege

22:46.012 --> 22:48.579
- can handle the truth of my life?
- Hell yeah.

22:48.581 --> 22:49.777
What happened?

22:49.779 --> 22:50.692
- You want to know?
- Oh, yeah.

22:50.717 --> 22:51.685
Do you really want to know?

22:51.687 --> 22:53.450
Oh, sure. Why not?

22:55.232 --> 22:56.654
Ah.

22:56.656 --> 22:57.953
Right on time.

22:57.955 --> 22:59.486
I don't like this any more than you do,

22:59.488 --> 23:01.197
but Keough's coming with me.

23:09.769 --> 23:11.602
We just want our son back.

23:11.604 --> 23:13.837
James is the final movement
in Keough's opus.

23:13.839 --> 23:15.306
That's why he wants out.

23:15.308 --> 23:16.812
You're not saving your son.

23:16.814 --> 23:17.980
You're serving him up on an altar.

23:17.982 --> 23:20.411
I'm sorry. We'll send you a check.

23:22.315 --> 23:23.647
Stay on Keough.

23:23.649 --> 23:25.084
Eric, they fired us.

23:25.086 --> 23:27.451
I know. I don't care.

23:27.453 --> 23:30.100
We're missing something
and I'm gonna find it.

23:43.657 --> 23:45.570
That, uh, must've been a lot to process.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.332
You know, my mother was involved
with a man like your father.

23:51.046 --> 23:52.230
He got into her head.

23:52.232 --> 23:53.598
Turned her into a weapon.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.834
Convinced her she was willing to kill.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.379
What happened?

23:59.239 --> 24:02.967
Someone... intervened.

24:04.301 --> 24:07.345
It's not easy growing up knowing
that's where you came from.

24:07.844 --> 24:12.136
I've always just felt like an intruder

24:13.046 --> 24:15.019
in my own life, you know?

24:18.338 --> 24:20.192
Yeah.

24:32.663 --> 24:34.639
Thank you.

24:38.919 --> 24:40.545
We checked the perimeter.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.214
So far no signs of ambush
or a fresh grave.

24:43.216 --> 24:44.649
Lydia March?

24:44.651 --> 24:47.319
She packed a bag and the safe is empty.

24:47.321 --> 24:48.887
Think she left town.

24:50.431 --> 24:52.474
So she was the copycat?

24:55.060 --> 24:57.061
All right, people.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.739
I want an APB on Lydia March, aged 49.

25:00.764 --> 25:02.597
He's running out of air, Colton.

25:02.599 --> 25:04.266
You have less than an hour left.

25:04.268 --> 25:07.035
One false move, you get a bullet
in the back of the head.

25:07.037 --> 25:09.204
Now where is he?

25:11.702 --> 25:13.241
Let's go.

25:23.654 --> 25:25.720
Eric, they're at the greenhouse.

25:25.722 --> 25:27.088
Stay with them.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.757
Got it.

26:05.229 --> 26:07.028
Crisis Resolutions.

26:07.030 --> 26:07.961
Zara, you really shouldn't be working.

26:07.963 --> 26:09.865
Eric, I'm five centimeters dilated

26:09.867 --> 26:11.066
and somebody's kid
is trapped in a coffin.

26:11.068 --> 26:12.033
Do you really want to debate me?

26:12.035 --> 26:13.101
Okay. F-Fine.

26:13.103 --> 26:15.146
Listen, I'm gonna send you a picture.

26:15.148 --> 26:16.845
Get the Natural Language Processor

26:16.847 --> 26:18.974
to apply Alberti's disk
to Keough's letters.

26:18.976 --> 26:20.542
Okay. What's Alberti's disk?

26:20.544 --> 26:23.834
It's like a-a purposely
rearranged alphabet in a circle.

26:23.836 --> 26:26.147
You, uh, you put the regular
alphabet over it

26:26.149 --> 26:27.549
and presto, you have a code.

26:27.551 --> 26:29.918
- On it.
- Okay, great.

26:37.694 --> 26:40.028
Aren't they exquisite?

26:40.030 --> 26:41.496
Quit stalling, Keough.

26:41.498 --> 26:43.265
Where the hell is he?

27:14.450 --> 27:15.630
Yeah?

27:15.632 --> 27:18.641
Eric, NLP found the code.
It applied the Alberti's disk

27:18.643 --> 27:21.136
to the letters
between Lydia March and Keough

27:21.138 --> 27:23.251
and found detailed instructions
on how and when

27:23.253 --> 27:24.761
to kidnap James Smith.

27:24.763 --> 27:25.819
It's all here.

27:25.821 --> 27:26.881
So it was Lydia?

27:26.883 --> 27:29.110
Well, NLP found

27:29.112 --> 27:31.413
a discrepancy in the gender category.

27:31.415 --> 27:33.815
How so? In the earlier letters,

27:33.817 --> 27:37.469
the author used the feminine
pronouns “I, she, we,”

27:37.471 --> 27:40.655
but then about three years ago,
it changed.

27:40.657 --> 27:45.660
The pronouns were replaced with
the articles “the, a, mine, it”

27:46.105 --> 27:47.495
and numbers.

27:47.497 --> 27:51.166
So, the author of the most
recent letters was masculine?

27:51.168 --> 27:54.609
Exactly. Not Lydia.

27:54.611 --> 27:56.523
Really? This job was your dream?

27:56.525 --> 27:58.840
Well, the Spice Girls
already had a redhead.

28:00.310 --> 28:05.914
No. Uh... after my mom died,
the path led me here,

28:05.916 --> 28:07.749
<i>helping people like her.</i>

28:07.751 --> 28:09.505
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:10.153 --> 28:13.091
<i>Yeah, that's pretty cool.</i>

28:14.051 --> 28:16.591
I don't feel that strongly about...

28:16.593 --> 28:17.749
<i>anything.</i>

28:17.751 --> 28:20.829
<i>I mean, my stepdad's a dentist.</i>

28:21.642 --> 28:23.798
<i>My mom...</i>

28:25.502 --> 28:26.768
I don't know.

28:26.770 --> 28:28.403
I don't want to be like either of them.

28:28.405 --> 28:30.238
Well, as long as you don't
end up like Vincent Keough,

28:30.240 --> 28:31.573
I think you'll be fine.

28:33.010 --> 28:37.412
Uh, sorry. What do you mean by that?

28:49.088 --> 28:50.165
Oh.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.659
Eric, hi.

28:51.661 --> 28:53.895
Is Dale with you?
Yeah, I'm just dropping him off.

28:53.897 --> 28:55.196
Don't react.

28:55.198 --> 28:56.431
Dale is the copycat.

28:56.433 --> 28:58.099
Lydia was writing letters
between father and son.

28:58.101 --> 29:00.198
Just a conduit. Don't provoke him.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.391
Just leave.

29:01.393 --> 29:03.938
Yeah. See you soon.

29:04.518 --> 29:05.507
You're good.

29:05.509 --> 29:06.708
You disarmed me.

29:08.063 --> 29:10.045
You got me talking.

29:24.027 --> 29:26.294
You son of bitch.

29:29.878 --> 29:32.133
It's a liquid form of deadly nightshade.

29:32.588 --> 29:35.403
Huh? Why am I not affected?

29:36.174 --> 29:38.073
Well, that's a good question, Meyers.

29:38.687 --> 29:41.303
That's because the plant in my cell

29:42.014 --> 29:44.279
is actually deadly nightshade.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.882
And I've been microdosing

29:47.884 --> 29:50.085
for five years.

29:50.814 --> 29:52.858
Building up an immunity.

29:54.524 --> 29:56.925
Thank you for asking.

30:06.496 --> 30:07.535
Eric.

30:07.537 --> 30:08.570
Oliver, it's a trap.

30:08.572 --> 30:10.271
You've got to warn Meyers.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.908
- Inside.
- Oliver, can you hear me?

30:14.744 --> 30:15.964
Oliver?

30:25.655 --> 30:27.722
Guard!

30:29.593 --> 30:31.192
Hello.

30:31.980 --> 30:33.361
So, who are you?

30:53.193 --> 30:54.972
It's so good to see you on the outside.

30:54.973 --> 30:56.338
It's good to see you, too, son.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.757
Can you put Mr...

30:59.211 --> 31:02.679
Yates in the van with the coffin?

31:02.681 --> 31:04.180
Let's go.

31:05.017 --> 31:06.467
You haven't buried him yet.

31:07.714 --> 31:09.252
It's airtight.

31:09.254 --> 31:11.354
He's dying as we speak.

31:13.225 --> 31:14.690
Let's go.

31:24.304 --> 31:25.470
James.

31:25.472 --> 31:26.971
Yeah.

31:26.973 --> 31:29.313
James, my name is Oliver Yates.
Can you hear me?

31:29.315 --> 31:30.333
Yeah, I can hear you.

31:30.335 --> 31:32.186
- Oh, thank God, okay.
- You gotta get me out of here.

31:32.188 --> 31:33.448
Stay with me, man.

31:33.450 --> 31:34.908
All right? Stay with me.

31:34.910 --> 31:38.549
We're really gonna do this.
We're gonna finish your opus.

31:38.551 --> 31:42.020
“We” is right, but it's
just Dale and I now.

31:42.592 --> 31:43.788
What?

31:43.790 --> 31:47.358
Uh... you said that we were
gonna do this together.

31:47.360 --> 31:51.229
Yes. Then you opened up
your stupid little mouth

31:51.231 --> 31:52.864
about my grand opus.

31:52.866 --> 31:54.813
You risked everything.

31:55.348 --> 31:59.483
And, Lydia, what the hell
was that about the French River?

31:59.508 --> 32:01.381
You kept using our letters
to talk to your son,

32:01.406 --> 32:05.282
but you said you loved me. I need you.

32:05.449 --> 32:08.379
I have all these questions,

32:08.381 --> 32:09.807
and you keep ignoring me.

32:09.809 --> 32:12.417
I just want to know everything about you.

32:14.454 --> 32:15.787
Well, you screwed up.

32:34.140 --> 32:35.707
This better be someone
other than Zara Hallam.

32:35.709 --> 32:37.075
Eric,

32:37.077 --> 32:39.444
seven centimeters dilated,
so I'll make this quick.

32:39.446 --> 32:42.332
I requested satellite imaging
of all of the burial sites

32:42.334 --> 32:44.014
of Keough's previous victims.

32:44.016 --> 32:45.784
Does the shape match
any of the zodiac signs?

32:45.786 --> 32:47.752
Nope. Not even close.

32:47.754 --> 32:49.587
That doesn't make any sense.

32:49.589 --> 32:51.496
Alberti's disk was on the
ceiling, right by the zodiac.

32:51.498 --> 32:53.371
I would've bet a million bucks...

32:53.987 --> 32:55.284
Wait.

32:56.930 --> 33:00.932
Keough hates greed,
people who worship money.

33:00.934 --> 33:04.569
Zara, send me the satellite
image of the burial sites.

33:04.571 --> 33:06.571
Okay.

33:06.573 --> 33:07.905
Sent.

33:07.907 --> 33:10.141
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

33:10.143 --> 33:11.556
What is it?

33:12.779 --> 33:13.778
It's EURion.

33:13.780 --> 33:14.912
What's that?

33:14.914 --> 33:16.180
The EURion constellation.

33:16.182 --> 33:17.648
It's-it's not a real constellation,

33:17.650 --> 33:19.456
it's a symbol on all paper currencies.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.780
It's an anti-counterfeiting measure.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.420
A sequence of five rings.

33:23.422 --> 33:25.133
Four of the victims are buried already.

33:25.135 --> 33:27.233
So we can use the fifth ring

33:27.235 --> 33:29.950
to figure out where James is buried.

33:30.630 --> 33:32.463
It's an old sawmill.

33:32.465 --> 33:33.898
Sending you geo coordinates right now.

33:33.900 --> 33:34.910
Ooh!

33:34.912 --> 33:36.701
- Zara, you okay?
- Yup, yup!

33:36.703 --> 33:39.504
Just... having a baby. Good luck.

33:40.001 --> 33:41.706
Nurse!

33:55.392 --> 33:57.522
Uh...

33:57.524 --> 33:59.223
Oh, God. Okay.

34:13.106 --> 34:14.739
Fill it in, please.

34:16.409 --> 34:17.809
No.

34:26.119 --> 34:27.518
I said no.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.320
Dale, when he has to choose

34:29.322 --> 34:31.054
between your life and his freedom,

34:31.056 --> 34:32.389
which way do you think
he's gonna go, huh?

34:42.742 --> 34:44.242
He said fill it in.

34:47.306 --> 34:49.139
The next one's in his chest!

34:49.141 --> 34:51.375
- Okay, okay.
- Dig! Dig!

35:07.060 --> 35:08.459
<i>Let me tell you</i>

35:08.461 --> 35:10.008
about my father.

35:10.763 --> 35:13.264
Spent years trying to find work,

35:13.266 --> 35:15.166
but those rich bastards in town,

35:15.168 --> 35:18.603
well, they couldn't look down
their nose far enough at him.

35:18.605 --> 35:23.014
This place... Eric was right.

35:23.016 --> 35:25.089
It all started here.
Your father didn't just

35:25.091 --> 35:26.650
run off, did he?

35:27.180 --> 35:28.779
I saw it in his eyes.

35:28.781 --> 35:30.381
He'd had enough.

35:30.383 --> 35:32.906
They'd finally broken him.

35:33.486 --> 35:35.686
That's why I followed him
up here to this very spot.

35:36.660 --> 35:40.424
His shotgun in his hand,
and I begged him to stop.

35:40.426 --> 35:42.059
But he just looked right through me.

35:42.902 --> 35:44.662
He turned the barrel around...

35:48.001 --> 35:49.293
Blew his brains out.

35:49.295 --> 35:50.601
Then you walked out here,

35:50.603 --> 35:52.567
and you saw the fawn at the French River.

35:52.569 --> 35:54.171
Everything I've done,

35:54.173 --> 35:57.475
my grand opus, it's a love letter

35:57.477 --> 36:01.746
from son to father.
And now, from father to son.

36:03.349 --> 36:04.749
James just ran out of air.

36:04.751 --> 36:06.457
Brain damage in seven minutes.

36:06.459 --> 36:10.321
Dead in ten. No saving him now.

36:12.926 --> 36:14.735
You know what, Keough?

36:14.737 --> 36:16.717
You're full of crap.

36:16.719 --> 36:17.818
What about Lydia?

36:17.820 --> 36:19.607
- I'm sorry, who?
- She worshipped you,

36:19.609 --> 36:22.595
- and you threw her away.
- You can't throw trash away,

36:22.597 --> 36:23.634
Mr. Yates.

36:23.636 --> 36:25.369
It's trash!

36:25.371 --> 36:26.404
Was your father trash?

36:27.961 --> 36:29.173
I wonder, could he not find work

36:29.175 --> 36:31.075
or could he just not hold down a job?

36:31.077 --> 36:32.977
- I beg your pardon?
- There's no message here.

36:32.979 --> 36:36.013
You're not a prophet. Your
son is right. You're a fraud.

36:37.317 --> 36:38.449
Good-bye, Mr. Yates.

36:43.990 --> 36:46.533
- Okay! Okay!
- Put it down!

36:46.535 --> 36:47.615
Put it down!

36:47.640 --> 36:49.280
Dale, you don't have to do this.

36:49.282 --> 36:50.761
Your father's not worth it.

36:50.763 --> 36:51.729
What do you know?!

36:51.731 --> 36:53.064
Huh?! Orphan girl,

36:53.066 --> 36:54.732
- you even know your father?!
- You don't have to be

36:54.734 --> 36:56.567
an intruder in your own life.
There are other ways.

36:56.569 --> 36:59.270
- I promise you.
- I tried and they didn't work!

36:59.272 --> 37:02.067
You move that knife one more
inch, I swear to God...

37:02.069 --> 37:03.741
- Yeah?
- You'll what?

37:03.743 --> 37:05.142
Look at your hands.

37:05.144 --> 37:06.844
You won't do anything.

37:06.846 --> 37:07.919
Yes, I will.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.614
- Slit his throat.
- Maxine...

37:09.616 --> 37:11.749
- Oli...
- Oh, my goodness.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.506
You're sweethearts.

37:14.420 --> 37:15.686
Maxine, I love you.

37:17.016 --> 37:17.922
Dale...

37:17.924 --> 37:19.387
Do it! Now!

37:28.701 --> 37:30.301
Not another move, Keough!

37:31.871 --> 37:33.371
Oliver? Are you okay?

37:33.373 --> 37:35.039
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- James? James, James.

37:35.041 --> 37:36.407
- James!
- James!

37:36.409 --> 37:37.508
James!

37:37.510 --> 37:39.110
James!

37:39.112 --> 37:42.346
- James! Please wake up!
- Get in here!

37:43.120 --> 37:44.348
Honey.

37:44.350 --> 37:46.550
Oh... oh.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.068
The past has a strong
hold on us, doesn't it?

38:05.438 --> 38:08.937
Informs our future more
than it has any right to.

38:09.742 --> 38:12.076
I can't feel my fingertips.

38:12.078 --> 38:14.245
You're in shock.

38:17.750 --> 38:20.651
I thought if I...

38:20.653 --> 38:23.654
shared your commitment
to preserving life,

38:23.656 --> 38:26.123
if I worked the job just like you did,

38:26.125 --> 38:28.494
- it would bring me peace.
- Maxine...

38:30.041 --> 38:32.029
All it brought me was more death.

38:34.254 --> 38:36.033
He was just a stupid kid.

38:36.035 --> 38:37.868
Look, I'm not gonna tell you

38:37.870 --> 38:40.037
that you did the right thing,
because it didn't help

38:40.039 --> 38:42.173
when everyone said that to me.

38:42.175 --> 38:44.889
Just remember...

38:46.145 --> 38:49.146
you saved a good man's life tonight.

38:57.457 --> 38:59.056
You're okay.

39:10.670 --> 39:13.710
How is it that I just had a baby
and you look worse than I do?

39:13.712 --> 39:15.906
- Botox.
- Oh, don't make me hurt you, Yates.

39:15.908 --> 39:17.093
Hey, buddy.

39:17.118 --> 39:19.276
So you're the reason I had to
drive myself to work today.

39:19.278 --> 39:21.979
You did some job, Zara. He's perfect.

39:21.981 --> 39:23.614
- Mm.
- You think of a name yet?

39:25.763 --> 39:27.451
Guys, can you give us a second?

39:27.453 --> 39:29.720
- Sure.
- Yeah.

39:34.026 --> 39:35.292
Hey.

39:35.294 --> 39:37.161
Good day?

39:37.163 --> 39:39.567
Yeah. Great day.

39:39.569 --> 39:41.165
Oh.

39:41.167 --> 39:43.376
- Come on. Do you want to hold him?
- Oh, Zara,

39:43.378 --> 39:45.536
- I-I don't know.
- Please.

39:45.538 --> 39:47.705
I would like him to meet his namesake.

39:47.707 --> 39:50.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:50.143 --> 39:53.039
Max, meet Max.

39:53.041 --> 39:55.412
Hi, Max.

39:55.414 --> 39:57.414
Hello, Max.

39:57.416 --> 39:59.216
Yes, hello.

39:59.218 --> 40:00.651
Mike is really upset.

40:00.653 --> 40:02.686
He wanted me to name him Wilf.

40:03.259 --> 40:04.588
- Oh.
- Oh. I know.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.342
- Yeah, you wouldn't like that.
- No.

40:06.344 --> 40:08.159
- You wouldn't like that. No.
- Mm.

40:08.161 --> 40:11.395
Yes. All the faces. Yes.

40:11.397 --> 40:13.964
You're good at this.

40:46.928 --> 40:48.599
<i>Dear Eric,</i>

40:48.601 --> 40:51.735
<i>I'm writing a letter because
if I did this in person,</i>

40:51.737 --> 40:53.938
<i>you'd probably cry.</i>

40:53.940 --> 40:57.274
<i>Joking. We probably both would.</i>

40:57.276 --> 41:00.077
<i>I'm not sure what I expected
joining Cri/Res,</i>

41:00.079 --> 41:02.860
<i>but I know it didn't include
taking a life.</i>

41:05.029 --> 41:07.949
<i>When my mother died, I was alone.</i>

41:09.956 --> 41:11.455
<i>And I felt that way</i>

41:11.457 --> 41:14.914
<i>until I learned you two had been in love.</i>

41:17.930 --> 41:20.837
<i>Delaine turned her into an object...</i>

41:22.301 --> 41:24.090
<i>a device.</i>

41:26.539 --> 41:30.263
<i>But knowing she was capable
of love made her human again.</i>

41:33.446 --> 41:36.113
<i>I want to feel that way again, too.</i>

41:36.115 --> 41:38.813
<i>It just seems so far away right now.</i>

41:41.858 --> 41:44.521
<i>You hired me to bug you, Eric,</i>

41:44.523 --> 41:46.857
<i>and I hope I did my job well.</i>

41:46.859 --> 41:49.324
<i>But not too well.</i>

41:50.074 --> 41:52.859
<i>With love, Maxine.</i>
