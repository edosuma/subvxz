00:07.649 --> 00:08.879
Hello.

00:09.589 --> 00:11.120
I make toasts\Nin the morning.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.320
Do you want a toast?

00:12.320 --> 00:13.320
Yes.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.690
(Pork belly and ham,\NPork belly and cutlet)

00:15.690 --> 00:17.360
(Set menu: free cola)

00:18.090 --> 00:19.159
Please give me number two.

00:25.470 --> 00:26.470
Did you kill...

00:28.069 --> 00:29.299
the old man?

00:37.609 --> 00:38.910
Why did you do it?

00:40.350 --> 00:41.350
What are you...

00:43.090 --> 00:44.689
trying to hide?

00:55.460 --> 00:56.469
Right.

00:57.329 --> 00:58.399
It's strange.

00:59.999 --> 01:00.999
Yoon Mi Joo...

01:02.910 --> 01:04.638
may not be the culprit.

01:07.179 --> 01:09.039
I heard you met\NSeo Hyun Soo.

01:10.009 --> 01:12.410
Yes. She came\Nlooking for Detective Ha.

01:12.410 --> 01:14.119
I remember because...

01:14.119 --> 01:15.179
it really threw him off.

01:15.179 --> 01:17.490
Detective Ha?\NLieutenant Ha Wan Seung?

01:17.850 --> 01:20.419
Yes, he's now working at\NJoongjin Police Station.

01:20.559 --> 01:22.690
Was she really\NSeo Hyun Soo?

01:23.059 --> 01:25.059
Why do you ask?

01:25.360 --> 01:26.660
Because Ms. Seo...

01:27.800 --> 01:30.369
passed away 17 years ago.

01:30.669 --> 01:33.140
- What?\N- Do you know her voice?

01:34.569 --> 01:35.569
Yes.

01:54.589 --> 01:55.759
Mr. Kim.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.860
I heard you've been\Nlooking for me.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.259
Who are you?

02:00.660 --> 02:01.929
It's me, Hyun Soo.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.699
Seo Hyun Soo.

02:03.699 --> 02:05.130
Is that her voice?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.500
No, she sounds\Ncompletely different.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.800
She doesn't even\Nsound similar.

02:11.869 --> 02:12.869
Then...

02:13.679 --> 02:16.110
it means Seo Hyun Soo\Nisn't just one person.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.950
(Joongjin Police Station)

02:21.080 --> 02:22.349
Hello, everyone.

02:22.779 --> 02:23.849
Hello.

02:25.149 --> 02:27.589
Will you get up? Get up.

02:28.290 --> 02:29.629
Unbelievable.

02:29.629 --> 02:31.260
What?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.860
I can't believe you.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.059
You wanted me\Nto wake you up...

02:35.059 --> 02:36.499
when Mr. Gye\Ncomes to work.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.170
No, it wasn't Mr. Gye.

02:38.399 --> 02:39.770
I was talking\Nabout Mr. Hwang.

02:40.339 --> 02:41.869
Oh, Mr. Hwang.

02:42.839 --> 02:45.640
Have you been studying\Nall night to get promoted?

02:45.740 --> 02:47.480
Keep it together,\Nand get to work.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.710
I don't have to do that\Nto catch criminals.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.909
You keep it together,\Nbut you never catch one.

02:52.409 --> 02:54.020
But he's good at\Ngetting promoted.

02:56.990 --> 02:58.390
Wan Seung.

02:58.790 --> 02:59.860
Why don't you transfer\Nto another team?

02:59.860 --> 03:01.059
I don't want to pack up.

03:01.189 --> 03:02.689
If you want to transfer,\Nyou can.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.059
How dare you\Nmake me leave?

03:05.929 --> 03:06.929
I have to go\Nuse the toilet.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.129
What was that?

03:10.700 --> 03:12.670
Does he think\Nhe's my superior?

03:18.339 --> 03:19.339
Look.

03:19.879 --> 03:20.909
Where is he going?

03:22.909 --> 03:24.409
Are you going\Nto the forensics team?

03:24.649 --> 03:25.649
Yes, why?

03:25.980 --> 03:28.679
I heard that's the most\Ndangerous place here.

03:29.219 --> 03:30.290
Dangerous? Why?

03:30.290 --> 03:32.089
Mr. Gong says...

03:32.089 --> 03:33.760
your head will\Ncrumble down in there.

03:34.659 --> 03:36.159
Why are you following me?

03:36.830 --> 03:38.260
Because it's exciting.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.129
I love going into\Nhaunted house and stuff.

03:42.399 --> 03:44.629
Mr. Gye must be tired\Nfrom dealing with you.

03:44.629 --> 03:47.670
I'll take a selfie as\Nsoon as I see Mr. Hwang.

03:48.099 --> 03:49.200
Did you get a new phone?

03:49.469 --> 03:51.170
It just came out.

03:51.170 --> 03:52.170
Do you want to see it?

03:52.740 --> 03:53.779
Who got it for you?

03:53.779 --> 03:54.809
My dad.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
Good for you.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.050
Okay.

04:01.749 --> 04:02.779
Like this.

04:05.689 --> 04:06.689
Take a look.

04:09.490 --> 04:11.490
(Constable Shin)

04:11.490 --> 04:13.330
That's funny.

04:25.609 --> 04:27.109
We don't have much time.

04:27.839 --> 04:29.979
I'm keeping my eyes\Non Lieutenant Ha.

04:30.909 --> 04:33.750
Do you have to\Ndo this so suddenly?

04:42.359 --> 04:43.729
Let's do that.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.159
You've never been there?

04:49.460 --> 04:50.570
It's here.

04:50.570 --> 04:52.000
(Restricted)

04:55.669 --> 04:56.909
What brings you here?

04:56.909 --> 04:57.940
I'd like to know\Nthe autopsy result...

04:57.940 --> 04:59.109
of Noryang-dong case.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.109
- Come in.\N- Thanks.

05:03.310 --> 05:04.380
Wait.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.750
What brings you here?

05:08.649 --> 05:10.149
She likes haunted houses.

05:10.849 --> 05:12.890
Are you\NConstable Shin Na Ra?

05:12.890 --> 05:14.419
Yes. Do you know me?

05:14.419 --> 05:16.330
The one who goes to\Nclubs every night,

05:16.330 --> 05:17.430
shops online all the time,

05:17.430 --> 05:19.430
and takes selfies\Nat crime scenes.

05:19.430 --> 05:20.529
So you're\Nthe attention seeker.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.799
Everyone wonders how you\Npassed the police exam.

05:22.799 --> 05:24.830
You're lucky to have\Nsuch an easy life.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.799
So be good to your dad.

05:30.669 --> 05:32.270
Go play at\Nan amusement park.

05:32.510 --> 05:34.140
Don't waste\Nmy precious time.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.979
Waste people's\Ntax money instead.

05:40.419 --> 05:41.620
Attention...

05:42.580 --> 05:43.620
seeker?

05:45.549 --> 05:46.620
Do you want tea?

05:46.620 --> 05:48.159
Yes, thank you.

05:52.930 --> 05:54.029
Drink it outside\Nthen come back.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.760
What?

05:55.760 --> 05:58.270
Did you expect me\Nto serve you tea?

05:58.270 --> 05:59.870
I'm not that free.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.739
Let's take a look\Nat the autopsy result.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.080
Did you say\NNoryang-dong murder case?

06:09.080 --> 06:10.109
Yes.

06:19.719 --> 06:20.789
Here you go.

06:23.859 --> 06:25.029
What does it say?

06:25.029 --> 06:26.359
(Autopsy Report)

06:26.359 --> 06:27.899
He fell down with\Nthe knife stuck in him,

06:27.899 --> 06:29.830
so he bled quite gently.

06:29.830 --> 06:30.969
He was stabbed only once.

06:30.969 --> 06:32.469
His abdominal artery\Nwas stabbed.

06:32.469 --> 06:35.270
He seems to have died\Nfrom internal bleeding.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.770
What's this scar?

06:38.640 --> 06:39.779
It's from surgery.

06:39.779 --> 06:41.880
The location tells me\Nit was abdominal aneurysm.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.210
Why did the culprit\Nonly stab him once?

06:43.210 --> 06:45.080
I don't know.\NI'm not a profiler.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.750
I don't care about\Nthe culprit's thoughts.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.919
Did the culprit not\Nintend to kill him?

06:56.359 --> 06:57.659
(Chief Kang Bo Gook)

07:05.000 --> 07:06.029
There.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.609
You always give me\Ninstant coffee.

07:09.609 --> 07:11.239
Don't you have Americano?

07:11.969 --> 07:14.180
Americano, my foot.

07:14.539 --> 07:16.080
You should pay\Nfor the coffee.

07:16.609 --> 07:19.750
Don't try to get free\Ninformation from me.

07:19.750 --> 07:20.950
Pay for it.

07:21.479 --> 07:23.649
The real estate isn't\Ndoing well these days.

07:24.049 --> 07:26.149
I don't want to make you\Nfeel uncomfortable.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.120
I'm not like that.

07:28.589 --> 07:30.359
Even if you brought me\Neverything you had,

07:30.359 --> 07:32.060
I wouldn't feel\Nuncomfortable.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.060
So why did you call me?

07:33.060 --> 07:34.930
Did you call me to\Nsettle my coffee bill?

07:35.799 --> 07:38.830
Do you know Woo Sung Ha?

07:38.830 --> 07:39.839
Inspector Woo?

07:39.839 --> 07:42.039
Yes. "Wanted Suspects".

07:42.039 --> 07:44.739
Yes, Inspector Woo\Nfrom the headquarters.

07:44.739 --> 07:47.409
Why is he looking for you?

07:47.409 --> 07:49.710
What? He's looking for me?

07:49.710 --> 07:51.810
Yes, he came to see me.

07:52.279 --> 07:53.950
He asked about you.

07:53.950 --> 07:55.719
It was strange.

07:58.789 --> 08:01.390
So who are you\Nlooking for?

08:01.390 --> 08:03.289
It's someone you know\Nvery well.

08:04.830 --> 08:06.190
Detective Ha Wan Seung.

08:07.729 --> 08:09.630
Why is that profiler\Nlooking for me?

08:14.940 --> 08:15.969
Wait a minute.

08:16.570 --> 08:17.810
Where are they going?

08:18.070 --> 08:19.339
Did he come for me?

08:21.339 --> 08:23.880
Then why was he\Nwith the chief?

08:24.210 --> 08:27.219
Did Inspector Woo\Ngo see the chief?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.149
The chief must've ordered\Nhim to watch me.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.460
I can't believe he even\Nbrought in a profiler.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.690
That's great.

08:37.059 --> 08:39.530
No, it isn't. Enemies are\Neverywhere.

08:40.099 --> 08:42.629
Enemy or not,\Ndon't be so cranky.

08:42.629 --> 08:45.499
Try to be friendly\Nwith Inspector Woo.

08:46.129 --> 08:48.969
He might be\Non the chief's good side.

08:49.170 --> 08:52.239
Also, you can get\Ninformation on Chief Shin.

08:52.509 --> 08:53.509
Okay?

08:53.979 --> 08:57.109
I'll try to be on good\Nterms with Chief Shin.

08:59.109 --> 09:00.519
Gosh,\Nthis coffee's terrible.

09:00.820 --> 09:03.190
You should get\Na coffeemaker.

09:11.530 --> 09:13.099
You should be in the\Ninstitute at this hour.

09:13.099 --> 09:14.660
What are you doing here?

09:14.660 --> 09:16.300
I'll catch\Nthe culprit first.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.469
I knew you couldn't\Nstay there long.

09:19.099 --> 09:21.269
Anyway, I didn't ask you\Nto be here.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.869
Don't blame me\Nif you fail the exam.

09:23.869 --> 09:26.479
I'll study after catching\Nthe culprit.

09:32.849 --> 09:34.119
Hey.

09:34.119 --> 09:36.219
- Hello, detectives.\N- Did you hurt your disc?

09:55.099 --> 09:56.310
Why are you here again?

09:56.710 --> 09:57.839
What do you want?

09:59.509 --> 10:02.040
Mr. Gye. She has a name.

10:02.379 --> 10:04.609
Don't call her like that.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.519
But you call me that too.

10:10.349 --> 10:12.450
But it's not the same\Nwhen I call you lady.

10:12.450 --> 10:13.719
You said\Nwhen I call you lady...

10:13.719 --> 10:15.320
it sounds like your name.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.729
I know you're close.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.060
But let's not mix\Nbusiness with pleasure.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.869
Okay.

10:26.030 --> 10:27.969
She knows Noryang-dong\Npretty well.

10:29.239 --> 10:31.009
You should clean up\Nyour desk.

10:31.070 --> 10:32.310
It's so messy.

10:32.310 --> 10:33.580
Witness.\NYou talk too much.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.479
Clean it yourself\Nif it bothers you.

How is Lee Wang Sik's\Ncase going?

10:40.950 --> 10:42.849
I was going to\Nreport to you.

10:42.889 --> 10:44.290
Why are you\Nhanging out here then?

10:44.389 --> 10:45.489
Let's go\Nto the meeting room.

Look who's here.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.129

10:58.269 --> 11:00.769
You gave up your duty\Nas an honorary officer...

11:00.769 --> 11:02.239

Sir, please let me\Njust this once.

11:29.129 --> 11:30.330
No.

11:30.330 --> 11:31.670
I'll be helpful.

11:31.670 --> 11:34.739
I'm like living in\NNoryang-dong these days.

11:36.609 --> 11:38.440
There are a lot of\Npolice officers here...

who used to live in\NNoryang-dong.

11:41.639 --> 11:42.810

11:43.249 --> 11:45.580
This case is strange.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.550
What if it's strange?

11:47.550 --> 11:49.479
Why are you trying to\Njoin the meeting?

11:49.650 --> 11:52.050
Didn't you say the last\Ncase was strange too?

Oh, that's right.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.839
I caught the culprit\Ntrying to...

12:07.839 --> 12:09.710
put the blame on\NNa Jin Tae.

12:10.339 --> 12:12.839
Manager Jo.\NHave a good meeting.

12:12.839 --> 12:14.310
I feel bad...

12:14.310 --> 12:16.609
about going straight home.

12:16.780 --> 12:20.280
I'll just hang out and\Ntalk with these reporters.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.979
- Let's have some tea.\N- Okay.

12:26.290 --> 12:27.859
I won't bother you at all.

12:29.489 --> 12:31.290
Let's go\Nto the meeting room.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.040
Why are you here again?

12:41.769 --> 12:43.469
It's that lady again.

12:43.839 --> 12:47.109
I am here to help you.

12:48.109 --> 12:49.440
Right, Manager Jo?

12:49.580 --> 12:50.609
What?

12:50.950 --> 12:54.119
Yes, sure. Please go in.

12:54.119 --> 12:55.550
Give her a chair.

12:55.550 --> 12:56.889
Manager Jo.

13:00.089 --> 13:02.930
MCJ or somebody is\Ntransferring here,

13:02.930 --> 13:05.190
so there are reporters\Nswarming outside.

13:05.190 --> 13:06.460
Let's keep things quiet.

13:06.460 --> 13:07.499
Who is MCJ?

13:07.499 --> 13:09.599
Gosh, you heard that?

13:11.999 --> 13:13.839
Since they're initials...

13:14.969 --> 13:16.099
I think it's nepotism.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.940
It could be the head\Nof security officer.

13:18.570 --> 13:19.979
I think it's someone\Nhigher up.

13:20.810 --> 13:22.639
Don't you know MC Jay?

13:22.639 --> 13:24.410
He's a rapper.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.080
Is he really coming here?

13:26.080 --> 13:27.479
I'm a huge fan of his.

13:28.249 --> 13:30.489
After questioning and\Nchecking security videos,

13:30.489 --> 13:31.849
we found that...

13:31.849 --> 13:34.019
suspect Yoon Mi Joo was\Npassing the alley...

13:34.290 --> 13:37.589
at 3:17am where\NLee Wang Sik was murdered.

13:37.830 --> 13:38.960
What about\Nthe autopsy result?

13:39.259 --> 13:41.200
He died from profuse\Ninternal bleeding.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.830
He was stabbed only once.

13:42.830 --> 13:44.869
He was stabbed\Nonly once but he died?

13:44.869 --> 13:46.300
Unfortunately, his aorta\Nhe had surgery on...

13:46.300 --> 13:47.339
was stabbed.

13:48.339 --> 13:49.440
Yoon Mi Joo\Nhas been living...

13:49.440 --> 13:51.910
in a residence referred\Nby Lee Wang Sik.

13:51.910 --> 13:54.280
They had a fight\Nbecause of rent.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.379
Any other suspects?

13:57.379 --> 13:59.050
At the time of the murder,

13:59.050 --> 14:00.820
the person who went\Nthrough the alley was...

14:00.820 --> 14:02.219
According to the videos\Nwe checked,

14:02.219 --> 14:03.249
there was\Nonly Yoon Mi Joo.

14:04.349 --> 14:05.519
What's that?

14:06.290 --> 14:08.489
It says locations\Nof security cameras.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.759
Just stay put.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.269
What is it?

14:20.739 --> 14:23.070
There are many ways...

14:23.509 --> 14:24.639
not to be caught\Non camera.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.420
There are no cameras\Nin this alley.

14:33.719 --> 14:35.019
What if you commit\Nmurder...

14:35.019 --> 14:37.089
and go in through\Nthe backdoor?

14:38.389 --> 14:39.589
There are no cameras...

14:39.589 --> 14:40.889
in the back\Nof the residence building.

14:41.790 --> 14:42.889
Even if the culprit came\Nout from the back door,

14:42.889 --> 14:43.989
stabbed the victim,

14:43.989 --> 14:45.729
and went into\Nthe back door again,

14:46.060 --> 14:47.499
they wouldn't be\Ncaptured in the CCTVs.

14:47.499 --> 14:49.359
Then we shouldn't\Njump to a conclusion...

14:49.530 --> 14:51.200
by looking only at\Nthe CCTV footages.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.700
That's exactly\Nwhat I want to say.

14:53.599 --> 14:55.300
They're both helpless.

14:56.940 --> 14:58.969
I don't think you\Nshould take her side.

14:59.509 --> 15:02.609
The back door is\Nalways locked.

15:02.609 --> 15:05.249
The manager has\Nthe back door key.

15:05.249 --> 15:06.650
It's most crucial...

15:06.650 --> 15:09.019
that we found the victim's\Nblood on her clothes.

15:09.479 --> 15:10.749
The blood stains\Non her clothes...

15:10.749 --> 15:11.820
means that she physically\Ncontacted him,

15:11.820 --> 15:13.460
and it can't be the\Nevidence of murder.

15:14.820 --> 15:15.889
Corporal Gong.

15:16.330 --> 15:19.129
We found the victim's\Nblood on her shoes too.

15:20.859 --> 15:22.259
Are you saying when\Nshe stabbed the victim,

15:22.259 --> 15:23.629
the blood was stained\Non her clothes,

15:23.629 --> 15:25.269
and she stepped\Non the blood...

15:25.269 --> 15:27.040
which ran down\Nfrom his injury?

15:27.739 --> 15:29.940
- That's right.\N- It's strange though.

15:30.540 --> 15:32.570
The upper sides\Nof her shoes were clean.

15:36.180 --> 15:39.210
The blood splatters first\Ninstead of running down...

15:39.310 --> 15:40.379
when someone\Nstabs the other.

15:40.979 --> 15:42.180
I get it.

15:42.619 --> 15:44.749
She didn't stab him, but\Nshe stabbed on the blood.

15:44.749 --> 15:47.320
So the blood wasn't\Nsplattered on her shoes.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.930
Did she step on the blood\Nas she passed by...

15:49.930 --> 15:52.190
after the victim died,\Nby any chance?

15:58.769 --> 16:00.170
I'm surprised.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.300
What's wrong with him?

16:03.739 --> 16:04.869
But...

16:06.139 --> 16:07.639
on the back of her shoe,

16:08.280 --> 16:11.050
we found the victim's\Nbloodstained fingerprints.

16:12.249 --> 16:13.479
In short...

16:15.320 --> 16:16.389
The victim...

16:17.820 --> 16:20.389
grabbed\NYoon Mi Joo's shoe?

16:23.160 --> 16:25.790
It's the evidence\Nthat he was alive.

16:26.599 --> 16:28.999
Then isn't it\N99.9 percent certain...

16:29.160 --> 16:30.969
that she's the culprit?

16:31.499 --> 16:32.769
But it's not 100 percent.

16:33.940 --> 16:34.940
Well,

16:35.400 --> 16:36.410
now,

16:37.109 --> 16:38.509
do you have anything\Nmore to say?

16:50.550 --> 16:52.849
Amateurs like you should\Nnot stick their nose...

16:53.119 --> 16:55.190
in the professionals'\Nbusiness.

16:56.660 --> 16:58.129
Good job though.

16:58.129 --> 17:00.930
We've become surer of\Nthe culprit thanks to you.

17:01.629 --> 17:05.200
99.9 points to\Nmen with wisdom

17:05.329 --> 17:07.969
We are 99.9 percent\Nsure of the culprit too

17:10.210 --> 17:12.839
I guess you really don't\Nget along with Noryang,

17:13.309 --> 17:14.579
seeing how your guess\Nis wrong.

17:15.339 --> 17:17.109
Which part of her clothes\Ndid you say...

17:17.109 --> 17:18.710
had the victim's\Nbloodstain?

17:18.910 --> 17:20.920
- This side of her arm.\N- Only here?

17:21.420 --> 17:22.650
It wasn't too much.

17:35.759 --> 17:36.769
Why?

17:37.029 --> 17:38.170
Do you have regrets?

17:39.170 --> 17:40.900
I need to talk to\NYoon Mi Joo.

17:41.499 --> 17:43.809
Mr. Gye won't let you go\Nin the interrogation room.

17:43.809 --> 17:45.370
He can't stop me\Nfrom visiting her.

17:47.079 --> 17:49.140
What is it? Tell me.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.880
I'm not\N100 percent sure...

17:52.110 --> 17:53.120
that she's the culprit.

17:53.950 --> 17:55.319
(Custody Regulations)

17:55.319 --> 17:57.249
I was a bit late that day,

17:57.719 --> 18:00.219
so I used the shortcut to\Ngo faster and it happened.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.989
Why do you think there was\Nblood on your clothes?

18:03.160 --> 18:05.259
I thought it was\Nmy nosebleed.

18:05.430 --> 18:06.729
I have a nosebleed often.

18:06.729 --> 18:08.460
Didn't you see anything?

18:08.700 --> 18:10.229
Did you not hear a scream?

18:12.130 --> 18:13.469
I really don't know.

18:14.069 --> 18:15.940
I had to take\Na mock test that day,

18:16.200 --> 18:19.170
so I couldn't think of\Nanything other than that.

18:19.809 --> 18:21.309
I didn't get a good score\Non the last mock test,

18:21.309 --> 18:22.710
so I was worried.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.380
You usually wear earphones\Neverywhere, right?

18:26.210 --> 18:27.749
And you close the\Nother ear with your hand.

18:27.749 --> 18:28.920
That's right.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.190
It's to listen to\Nthe important parts.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.690
You bumped\Ninto someone, right?

18:37.829 --> 18:40.600
And it was your right arm\Nwhich you were closing...

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
your ear with, right?

18:42.930 --> 18:43.930
That's right.

18:44.729 --> 18:46.069
How did you know?

18:46.069 --> 18:47.900
If you had stabbed\Nthe old man with a knife,

18:48.069 --> 18:50.269
you would've had blood\Nsomewhere on your clothes.

18:51.210 --> 18:52.610
If it had been\Nyour nosebleed,

18:52.610 --> 18:54.910
you would've had it on the\Nouter side of your arm.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.180
There's only one way\Nto get the blood...

19:02.180 --> 19:03.519
on the inner side\Nof your arm.

19:04.690 --> 19:08.059
Then the man\Nwho bumped into me...

19:08.059 --> 19:09.059
Right.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.029
You witnessed the culprit.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.430
The blood must've stained\Non your clothes then.

19:20.469 --> 19:23.269
Do you remember the face\Nby any chance?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440
Do you remember\Nhis clothes or height?

19:27.610 --> 19:30.410
I usually don't look\Nat people when I walk.

19:31.309 --> 19:33.850
You bumped into him.\NHow can you not remember?

19:34.249 --> 19:36.650
I don't want to waste\Nmy time arguing.

19:37.190 --> 19:38.519
So I just pass by\Nlike nothing happened.

19:42.090 --> 19:44.059
(Ino Residence)

19:54.200 --> 19:55.739
What kind of person...

19:56.170 --> 19:57.469
was the victim?

19:57.469 --> 19:59.779
He's well-known\Nin Noryang.

19:59.779 --> 20:01.009
He came to this town\Nempty-handed...

20:01.009 --> 20:02.239
and built a tall building.

20:02.239 --> 20:04.279
He built\Nthis residence too.

20:04.910 --> 20:07.819
You're investigating\Non the case because...

20:08.079 --> 20:09.719
Am I right?

20:09.719 --> 20:11.650
You think Mi Joo\Nmay not be the culprit.

20:11.650 --> 20:13.160
That's what\Nyou think, right?

20:14.590 --> 20:15.590
That day,

20:15.989 --> 20:18.360
did you see her go out?

20:18.430 --> 20:22.299
Yes, it was\Nprobably past 3am.

20:22.299 --> 20:23.769
She was unusually late.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.620
Why were you awake\Nat that time?

20:41.719 --> 20:42.989
That's...

20:43.319 --> 20:45.049
because of\Nthe car engine sound.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.420
It was a tuned car, so it\Nsounded extremely loud.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.630
- A tuned car?\N- Oh, right.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.130
There's a guy...

20:51.130 --> 20:53.229
who always parks his car\Nnext to the residence.

20:53.430 --> 20:56.200
He had a big argument\Nwith Mr. Chairman before.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.229
It's narrow here,

20:58.229 --> 21:00.969
so you can't park your car\Nin this alley.

21:01.140 --> 21:03.039
I'll call the police.\NNo, no.

21:03.039 --> 21:04.670
Get off.

21:05.009 --> 21:06.069
Is he the culprit\Nby any chance?

21:06.910 --> 21:08.880
Right, right.\NSo I'm right.

21:09.110 --> 21:10.180
He's the culprit.

21:14.850 --> 21:16.650
There are hardly\Nany people...

21:16.650 --> 21:18.120
who drive their cars\Nin this town.

21:18.249 --> 21:19.559
From institutes,\Nresidences,

21:19.559 --> 21:20.960
and study rooms\Nto restaurants,

21:20.960 --> 21:22.460
places are so close\Nto each other.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.460
It's more inconvenient\Nto drive a car.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.759
It's that car over there.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.200
That car.

21:42.809 --> 21:44.009
(Unit 1017)

21:45.579 --> 21:46.819
Where's M Tower?

21:46.819 --> 21:48.219
That's\Nthe biggest building...

21:48.219 --> 21:49.620
right in front of\Nthe intersection.

21:49.620 --> 21:51.150
It's where the sons\Nof rich families live.

21:51.150 --> 21:52.749
It's incomparable\Nto our residence.

21:52.749 --> 21:54.289
He lives in such\Na good place,

21:54.289 --> 21:55.460
so why would he park here?

21:56.360 --> 21:58.559
Wait, what's this?

21:59.729 --> 22:00.729
What?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
Hello?

22:08.299 --> 22:09.400
Yes.

22:10.210 --> 22:11.670
You're already here?

22:12.410 --> 22:13.539
Where are you?

22:17.479 --> 22:18.479
As expected.

22:18.710 --> 22:21.120
He looks much better\Nwithout the glasses.

22:21.279 --> 22:22.350
He does?

22:22.479 --> 22:23.890
Better, my foot.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.989
We've met before, so you\Nshould at least say hello.

22:28.989 --> 22:30.059
Hello.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.930
- Have you been well?\N- Yes.

22:35.900 --> 22:38.670
I argued with him\Nfor parking issues,

22:38.670 --> 22:40.200
but I didn't kill him.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.840
It doesn't make\Nsense at all.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.370
You live in M Tower,

22:44.539 --> 22:46.110
so why did you park here?

22:47.079 --> 22:49.410
I heard a lot of\Ngirls here...

22:49.410 --> 22:51.079
are innocent because\Nthey only study.

22:51.549 --> 22:52.779
So it's easy\Nto pick them up.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.180
What did you do at 3am?

22:55.380 --> 22:57.319
What do you mean?\NI sang at a karaoke.

22:57.489 --> 22:58.819
Then I went home.

23:00.489 --> 23:01.989
You didn't just go home.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.960
Look. It's as if he saw\Na ghost.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.769
Or...

23:12.130 --> 23:13.299
you killed someone.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.739
It's really not me.

23:16.739 --> 23:18.710
You stole\Nthe restroom keys, right?

23:21.079 --> 23:23.210
It's not\Nthat I stole them.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.410
I have them here.

23:24.410 --> 23:25.610
I didn't steal them.

23:25.610 --> 23:26.819
- You stole them.\N- Well...

23:27.979 --> 23:29.019
Actually,

23:29.519 --> 23:31.150
I really had to go to\Na restroom...

23:31.150 --> 23:33.190
when the karaoke\Nwas about to close.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.219
But I couldn't\Ndifferentiate...

23:35.219 --> 23:38.130
which one was\Nfor the men's restroom.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.390
It was urgent,

23:39.600 --> 23:41.729
so I took them all\Nand went to the restroom.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.579
Goodness.

24:35.579 --> 24:36.989
What was that?

24:45.229 --> 24:47.430
I was surprised, so I ran.

24:49.229 --> 24:51.729
Is it that surprising\Nto see someone walk in?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.269
What?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.370
Oh, I am...

24:57.170 --> 24:58.410
a bit timid.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.610
It was the women's\Nrestroom, wasn't it?

25:02.239 --> 25:03.249
How did you know?

25:03.249 --> 25:05.579
If not, why would you\Nrun away?

25:05.979 --> 25:08.079
You idiot. You were trying\Nto film women.

25:08.079 --> 25:09.420
I really wasn't.

25:09.479 --> 25:11.650
I didn't see any toilet\Npaper in the men's.

25:11.650 --> 25:14.460
I just went to the women's\Nto get some toilet paper.

25:14.460 --> 25:15.690
- That makes no sense.\N- See?

25:15.690 --> 25:18.059
You won't believe me even\Nwhen I tell the truth.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.229
Then how can I wipe myself\Nafter I go number two?

25:20.229 --> 25:21.259
Do I do it\Nwith my armpits?

25:21.259 --> 25:22.829
I needed toilet paper.

25:22.829 --> 25:24.569
This is exactly why\NI ran away.

25:24.569 --> 25:26.400
I want to become\Na government official,

25:26.400 --> 25:27.900
so I have to\Nbe careful with this.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.840
Do you even\Nstudy for the exam?

25:29.840 --> 25:32.410
Yes. I really am going to\Nbe a government official.

25:32.769 --> 25:34.680
I like people who are\Nlike government officials.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.950
Government officials\Nhate your type.

25:37.809 --> 25:39.210
Did you catch her face?

25:39.650 --> 25:40.779
Her face?

25:50.360 --> 25:52.059
- Who are you?\N- What?

25:54.259 --> 25:56.769
Isn't that a knife?

25:58.829 --> 26:00.539
Oh, she was\Nholding a knife.

26:03.309 --> 26:04.469
A knife?

26:04.509 --> 26:05.539
Yes.

26:11.710 --> 26:13.249
Why do you think\Nshe ran away?

26:13.249 --> 26:15.380
Because there was a guy\Nin the women's restroom?

26:15.380 --> 26:17.249
Don't people\Nusually scream first?

26:17.319 --> 26:20.090
No, she ran out\Nas soon as she saw me.

26:21.219 --> 26:22.319
That's odd.

26:24.090 --> 26:26.499
There she is.

26:27.729 --> 26:30.499
She quarreled with\Nthat grandpa often...

26:30.499 --> 26:32.170
for doing her business\Nin front of his market.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.340
It was a huge fight.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.340
- Goodness.\N- Move your truck.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.210
Goodness.

26:45.210 --> 26:48.019
Everyone in this town has\Nfought with that old man.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.090
Is that why\Nyou moved to this spot?

26:52.120 --> 26:54.960
He threw a huge fit\Nsaying that I'm ruining...

26:54.960 --> 26:58.090
his business, so what\Ncan I do? I had to move.

26:58.090 --> 27:00.559
I don't even turn to\Nface his direction...

27:00.559 --> 27:01.999
after that happened.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.569
Why did you go\Nto the restroom...

27:04.569 --> 27:06.499
on the day of his death?

27:11.509 --> 27:13.610
I really had to go,

27:13.610 --> 27:16.039
and that's the only\Nrestroom around here.

27:16.039 --> 27:17.410
Then why did you run away?

27:20.950 --> 27:23.450
I was afraid he'd see me\Nusing that restroom.

27:23.749 --> 27:27.190
He might call the police\Nbecause I picked...

27:27.190 --> 27:29.259
the restroom lock\Nwith my knife.

27:30.059 --> 27:32.360
What? A thief?

27:32.360 --> 27:34.559
You don't pay for\Nthe water, cleaning,

27:34.559 --> 27:37.370
or electricity, but\Nstill use this restroom.

27:37.370 --> 27:39.739
That makes you a thief,\Ndon't you think?

27:39.940 --> 27:41.640
He already caught me\Nusing the restroom...

27:41.640 --> 27:44.140
a long time ago with\Nhis security camera.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.309
I paid him 150 dollars\Nas a fine.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.509
For using the restroom?\NWhat a harsh old guy.

27:50.509 --> 27:53.319
He's a cold-blooded\Nand horrible old man.

27:53.579 --> 27:56.079
Everyone who\Nworks for him...

27:56.079 --> 27:58.219
has something to\Ncomplain about him.

27:58.789 --> 28:00.319
When you are\Na few minutes late,

28:00.620 --> 28:02.360
he takes off an entire\Nhour off their paycheck.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.430
And they gather money\Nfor get-togethers too.

28:04.729 --> 28:06.160
My goodness.

28:06.660 --> 28:10.130
I heard he bought his\Ngrandson a fancy car...

28:10.130 --> 28:11.829
and sent him abroad\Nto study.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.069
He went alone?

28:16.200 --> 28:18.239
A rich old man has died.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.340
We should be suspicious\Nof his family first.

28:20.340 --> 28:23.779
But it's really odd how\Nthey stabbed him once.

28:23.779 --> 28:25.009
If it's a family member,\Nhe or she...

28:25.009 --> 28:26.779
could have felt\Nweak hearted.

28:34.860 --> 28:35.860
Mr. Lee In Ho?

28:36.559 --> 28:38.529
- Who are you?\N- We're with the police.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.430
Is the culprit\Nleft-handed?

28:43.930 --> 28:45.100
Right-handed.

28:47.670 --> 28:50.569
When did you\Nhurt your arm?

28:51.870 --> 28:53.440
It's been a week.

29:37.690 --> 29:38.719
What do you think?

29:39.090 --> 29:40.190
Do you have any idea?

29:42.390 --> 29:43.630
I need something sweet.

29:44.930 --> 29:45.960
Sweet?

29:47.999 --> 29:51.069
What's this? The one that\Nlooks like pickled radish.

29:51.829 --> 29:53.039
Mango mousse cake.

29:53.039 --> 29:54.039
Oh, mango.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.210
It's her. That ring.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.110
It looks like\Npickled radish.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.680
But I'm not\N100 percent sure.

30:04.049 --> 30:06.009
I shouldn't have\Nhad that mixed liquor.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.519
I knew I put in\Ntoo much soju into that.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.809
Detective Ha. Are you\Nacquainted with her?

30:30.440 --> 30:32.410
He came here with you\Na few times.

30:32.410 --> 30:33.440
Yes.

30:33.479 --> 30:35.680
Are you a detective?

30:35.739 --> 30:36.880
You didn't know?

30:39.819 --> 30:41.350
She acts like\Nshe doesn't know.

30:41.719 --> 30:42.850
That's even more\Nsuspicious.

30:44.450 --> 30:46.190
Lady, pick your cake.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.590
If you can't pick\Nanything, get this.

30:48.590 --> 30:49.829
Pickled radish cake.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.029
Maybe it's not her.

30:55.499 --> 30:56.969
Maybe it's her.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.100
Right.

31:02.739 --> 31:03.910
Hypnotic investigation.

31:04.370 --> 31:05.509
Hypnotic investigation?

31:05.509 --> 31:07.479
With who? Yoon Mi Joo?

31:08.140 --> 31:09.809
I want to get it\Ndone to myself.

31:09.950 --> 31:11.110
Regarding which case?

31:11.110 --> 31:12.450
It's not any case.

31:13.279 --> 31:16.019
I just want to\Nremember someone.

31:17.190 --> 31:19.660
Hypnosis isn't the answer\Nto your dementia.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.420
You should\Ngo see a doctor.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.190
You've failed the exam\Nso many times,

31:24.190 --> 31:25.789
and now you have dementia.

31:26.190 --> 31:28.200
If you were good at\Ncatching criminals,

31:28.200 --> 31:29.499
I would've made it by now.

31:29.499 --> 31:31.370
You must really\Nhave dementia.

31:31.370 --> 31:33.600
You begged me to\Ntake you to the scenes,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.900
so I let you follow along\Na few times, and now this?

31:35.900 --> 31:38.569
You go around giving\Na ring to women, so I...

31:38.569 --> 31:39.579
A ring?

31:39.579 --> 31:42.340
You're making me very\Nfrustrated with the ring.

31:42.340 --> 31:43.479
I'm glad\Nyou brought it up.

31:43.479 --> 31:45.710
That makes me\Nreally angry again.

31:45.710 --> 31:46.850
- Gosh.\N- Goodness.

31:46.850 --> 31:48.049
You're here.

31:48.249 --> 31:50.620
Macaroons.\NLook, macaroons.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.090
They look so good.

31:54.690 --> 31:56.019
I'm glad you're here.

31:56.019 --> 31:57.630
Can you taste it\Nand tell me how it is?

31:57.630 --> 32:00.259
I can trust your opinion.

32:00.759 --> 32:03.229
Why do I care about\Nthe ring anyway?

32:03.569 --> 32:05.229
It's not like\Nwe're dating.

32:07.739 --> 32:10.370
I'll eat this and\Nbecome a detective soon.

32:10.539 --> 32:12.140
He's being so cheap.

32:16.610 --> 32:17.610
It's good.

32:17.749 --> 32:18.850
Is it?

32:21.779 --> 32:24.249
Of course, do you know\Nhow expensive this is?

32:24.289 --> 32:25.650
I thought you were\Nwell-cared for as a kid.

32:25.650 --> 32:27.759
Weren't you raised on\Nmacaroons, not rice?

32:27.759 --> 32:29.460
I got sick of it back in\Ngrade school.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.690
I had too much back then.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.289
Is that so?

32:32.289 --> 32:34.930
I'm glad to hear that.\NI'll finish these alone.

32:37.029 --> 32:39.170
Lady, we should be\Nsolving this case,

32:39.170 --> 32:41.469
not eating expensive\Ndesserts like this.

32:42.870 --> 32:45.239
I live with such\Na cheap and dirty guy.

32:47.009 --> 32:48.710
Do you two live together?

32:50.079 --> 32:52.180
We live in\Nthe same neighborhood.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.950
I mean, the same area.

32:54.749 --> 32:56.719
You two aren't\Nin the same neighborhood.

32:57.489 --> 32:59.090
Under the same sky.

32:59.989 --> 33:03.390
I live under the same sky\Nwith this cheap guy.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.690
Aren't we going to go?

33:04.690 --> 33:07.100
I'll take this\Npickled radish macaroon.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.969
I liked the chocolate one.\NChocolate macaroon.

33:20.210 --> 33:21.239
Here.

33:21.640 --> 33:22.809
I picked it up\Nfrom the street.

33:22.950 --> 33:24.809
Why are you giving it\Nto me? It's dirty.

33:24.809 --> 33:26.880
This is embezzlement\Nof a lost property.

33:28.380 --> 33:30.190
I saw that\Nyour phone was very old.

33:30.650 --> 33:32.319
So I bought this...

33:32.319 --> 33:33.819
with 24 months\Nof installment payment,

33:33.819 --> 33:36.059
complete with\Nphone insurance,

33:36.059 --> 33:38.059
and got it in your\Nfavorite color, purple.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.289
Maybe I shouldn't have.

33:39.360 --> 33:42.029
Then is this a present?

33:43.069 --> 33:45.170
Forget it then.\NI needed a new phone too.

33:46.569 --> 33:47.769
Thank you.

33:48.269 --> 33:49.440
It's so pretty.

33:51.009 --> 33:53.640
That purple color looks\Ngreat with your outfit.

33:55.739 --> 33:58.180
Detective Ha, wait for me.

34:05.090 --> 34:06.989
Three people didn't get\Non the security footage...

34:06.989 --> 34:09.590
although they passed\Nthis alley by.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.728
Park Gi Beom,\Nthe cup rice lady,

34:12.900 --> 34:14.360
and the culprit.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.030
There may be\Nmore suspects...

34:18.498 --> 34:20.239
if they walked out of\Nthe back door,

34:20.239 --> 34:21.800
stabbed the man,\Nand went back in.

34:22.570 --> 34:24.210
They wouldn't be\Non security footage.

34:25.710 --> 34:27.039
Let's go find them.

34:28.110 --> 34:29.978
Who? The culprit?

34:30.510 --> 34:32.280
Where? And how?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.248
She must be\Nin a good mood.

34:37.989 --> 34:40.719
What? Are you saying\Nthat she's the culprit?

34:41.059 --> 34:42.059
No.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.228
I'm looking for those\Nwho aren't the suspect.

34:46.159 --> 34:47.659
You'll eliminate\None at a time.

34:48.228 --> 34:49.228
Bingo.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.400
Restroom?

34:56.670 --> 34:58.809
When I opened\Nthe restroom door...

34:58.809 --> 35:00.809
Did you see anything?

35:01.909 --> 35:03.380
I didn't see his face,

35:03.979 --> 35:06.479
but I saw something white.

35:09.449 --> 35:12.019
Toilet paper? Something\Nlike toilet paper?

35:12.960 --> 35:15.990
Yes, that's right.\NThat white thing was...

35:15.990 --> 35:17.460
a roll of toilet paper.

35:21.900 --> 35:22.999
Gosh.

35:23.630 --> 35:24.699
What is that knife for?

35:41.679 --> 35:42.749
I see.

35:43.249 --> 35:46.119
She did\Ngo to the restroom.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.220
The knife scratched\Nthe door a few times...

35:49.729 --> 35:50.729
in the same spot.

35:51.990 --> 35:53.429
Put this away.

36:17.420 --> 36:18.519
There's no\Nsecurity camera here.

36:18.519 --> 36:20.889
Even if someone\Nstabbed him in the alley,

36:21.059 --> 36:22.559
nobody would've seen it.

36:22.559 --> 36:23.990
No, believe me.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.360
I'm telling you the truth.\NThe backdoor...

36:26.559 --> 36:27.760
is almost never used.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.300
You got the wrong person.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.099
- Are you sure?\N- Yes.

36:31.099 --> 36:32.429
We have a witness.

36:32.630 --> 36:33.740
We'll ask him.

36:39.679 --> 36:40.880
This is so stressful.

36:48.119 --> 36:49.119
I knew it.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.150
I was right.

36:51.619 --> 36:54.320
Excuse me.\NYou saw that earlier.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.019
Why do you\Nkeep bothering me?

36:56.019 --> 36:57.860
Because memories\Naren't perfect.

36:58.789 --> 36:59.900
Do you know...

36:59.960 --> 37:02.460
Lee In Ho that lives in\NIno Building?

37:02.800 --> 37:03.900
He's the victim's\Ngrandson.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.470
What about him?

37:08.769 --> 37:10.970
I only know his face.

37:10.970 --> 37:13.179
Do you know\Nthat he hurt his arm?

37:13.179 --> 37:15.380
I'm not sure.\NMaybe he did.

37:15.380 --> 37:16.479
I don't know.

37:17.010 --> 37:19.380
Hey. You better\Nanswer her properly.

37:21.650 --> 37:24.690
I really don't remember.

37:28.019 --> 37:29.590
(Video 1)

37:33.329 --> 37:35.630
Wait.\NHe isn't wearing a cast.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.070
Was that a fake cast?

37:38.999 --> 37:39.999
What?

37:40.039 --> 37:41.699
This is from a month ago.

37:41.769 --> 37:43.139
This is the recent one.

37:49.849 --> 37:51.150
He's wearing a cast.

37:52.409 --> 37:53.619
Then...

37:54.579 --> 37:55.720
he's the only suspect.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.249
What are you saying?\NIt's not me, really.

37:58.249 --> 37:59.490
Anyway.

37:59.490 --> 38:02.590
You did have a hidden\Ncamera on the bus.

38:05.490 --> 38:06.659
It's was this guy.

38:09.159 --> 38:10.800
People are looking.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.470
My hidden camera\Nisn't something filthy.

38:13.470 --> 38:16.099
That's why I can walk\Naround freely like this.

38:17.610 --> 38:20.210
I'm filming a documentary\Non Noryang-dong.

38:20.610 --> 38:21.639
Get it?

38:22.710 --> 38:23.979
Sometimes I have clips...

38:23.979 --> 38:27.050
of women's legs\Nor restrooms, but...

38:27.050 --> 38:28.179
Documentary\Non Noryang-dong?

38:28.179 --> 38:29.650
I bought\Nthe spy glasses...

38:29.650 --> 38:33.320
so I could film\Nthe inside of the bus.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.990
Look. I'm a man.

38:34.990 --> 38:37.190
I can look\Nat women's legs.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.490
So they just got filmed\Nby coincidence.

38:39.490 --> 38:40.900
Why are you filming\Na documentary?

38:41.630 --> 38:42.630
What?

38:42.970 --> 38:46.099
Well, this is\Nembarrassing.

38:46.099 --> 38:48.269
I'm planning on becoming\Na director...

38:48.269 --> 38:49.809
if I fail to become\Na government official.

38:49.809 --> 38:51.139
Girls love it...

38:51.139 --> 38:52.979
when I say I'm filming\Na documentary.

38:54.139 --> 38:56.139
Gosh,\Nhe's driving me crazy.

39:34.479 --> 39:36.749
Let's say you were filming\Nan innocent documentary.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.559
But filming a documentary\Ndoesn't prove that...

39:39.860 --> 39:41.820
you aren't the culprit.

39:42.519 --> 39:44.590
That means...

39:45.729 --> 39:46.729
he's the culprit.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.070
I really am not.

39:50.369 --> 39:51.929
I have to see Yoon Mi Joo.

39:51.970 --> 39:54.199
She might remember...

39:54.470 --> 39:55.800
if she sees him.

39:57.809 --> 39:59.070
You're dead.

40:01.139 --> 40:03.979
Why do I have to visit\Nsomeone I don't know?

40:03.979 --> 40:07.119
You're abusing your\Ngovernment authority.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.479
I guess you did\Nattend classes.

40:10.019 --> 40:11.349
You're a suspect.

40:11.690 --> 40:12.690
Should I recite\NMiranda Rights?

40:12.690 --> 40:15.090
Miranda Rights? Come on.

40:18.559 --> 40:19.630
Hello.

40:22.659 --> 40:25.999
Wait, it'd be nice to film\Na police documentary.

40:25.999 --> 40:27.139
Go ahead.

40:27.139 --> 40:28.300
I'd be happy\Nto arrest you...

40:28.300 --> 40:30.240
right here for filming\Nsurreptitiously.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.869
Getting arrested\Nin a police station.

40:31.869 --> 40:34.340
What a lovely suspect\Nthat is.

40:34.710 --> 40:36.809
You're right.\NYou're totally right.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.249
I'll put away\Nmy cellphone.

40:39.150 --> 40:41.179
What is this lady doing\Nanyway?

40:41.179 --> 40:42.320
Don't bother her.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.289
She's trying to figure out\Nwho the culprit is.

40:44.289 --> 40:45.420
The culprit...

40:47.889 --> 40:49.360
How dare you\Ncall her lady?

40:49.519 --> 40:50.659
Don't be rude.

40:51.460 --> 40:52.760
Is she a girl then?

40:53.130 --> 40:54.130
Sorry.

40:57.199 --> 40:59.070
Do you remember...

40:59.940 --> 41:01.199
seeing him?

41:02.070 --> 41:03.210
Look closely.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.409
I heard he bothered you.

41:06.139 --> 41:08.079
Open your eyes.

41:08.539 --> 41:09.749
They are open.

41:10.479 --> 41:12.579
I don't look at\Npeople's faces usually.

41:12.579 --> 41:13.880
Look again.

41:15.780 --> 41:17.289
I remember him.

41:18.789 --> 41:19.990
I remember this smell.

41:20.690 --> 41:21.820
This cologne.

41:22.519 --> 41:24.130
He followed me around\Nat the institute.

41:24.490 --> 41:25.490
Did you...

41:25.659 --> 41:28.329
smell this scent\Non that day?

41:32.999 --> 41:34.070
No.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.579
See? I told you\NI wasn't the culprit.

41:41.409 --> 41:43.650
I remember it now.

41:44.150 --> 41:45.349
The smell was...

41:46.519 --> 41:48.780
really fresh.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.360
Did it smell like mint?

41:58.130 --> 41:59.190
It's similar.

41:59.699 --> 42:01.960
Like toothpaste?\NDid he brush his teeth?

42:03.999 --> 42:05.429
It could be gum.

42:06.570 --> 42:07.670
Fresh scent.

42:17.610 --> 42:19.550
(Mint Toothpaste)

42:28.590 --> 42:30.490
(Mint Detergent)

42:31.289 --> 42:33.800
Did any of the suspects\Nsmell minty?

42:36.900 --> 42:38.070
That was it.

42:39.229 --> 42:40.240
What?

42:41.199 --> 42:42.269
Do you know\Nwho the culprit it?

42:43.769 --> 42:46.210
Tell me\Nwho you think it is.

42:46.740 --> 42:47.740
Not yet.

42:48.210 --> 42:50.079
I can go home, right?

42:50.510 --> 42:52.479
You're still\Nunder suspicion.

42:52.579 --> 42:54.320
Stay put in Noryang-dong.

42:54.550 --> 42:56.720
- Study hard.\N- Okay, got it.

42:59.420 --> 43:01.519
He looks like he'll cause\Ntrouble one day.

43:02.190 --> 43:03.960
Maybe he already has.

43:04.429 --> 43:05.429
What?

43:05.860 --> 43:07.460
Is he still\Non the list of suspects?

43:08.530 --> 43:10.369
Do you have the lab result\Nfrom the scene?

43:11.429 --> 43:14.099
Gosh, I have to\Nask the forensics.

43:14.499 --> 43:16.610
Are you\NConstable Shin Na Ra?

43:16.610 --> 43:18.110
Yes. Do you know me?

43:18.110 --> 43:19.880
The one who goes to\Nclubs every night,

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
shops online all the time,

43:20.880 --> 43:22.780
and takes selfies\Nat crime scenes.

43:22.780 --> 43:24.309
So you're\Nthe attention seeker.

43:24.949 --> 43:26.679
(Restricted)

43:29.280 --> 43:31.749
Lady, do you want to\Ncheck out the lab?

43:31.990 --> 43:33.860
Really? May I go?

43:33.860 --> 43:35.460
You aren't allowed, but...

43:35.690 --> 43:37.630
I'll talk to Mr. Hwang.

43:37.789 --> 43:39.599
Who is Mr. Hwang?

43:39.599 --> 43:41.329
The forensics psychopath.

43:42.429 --> 43:43.499
He's a great guy.

43:44.070 --> 43:45.070
Let's go.

43:45.070 --> 43:46.900
Mr. Hwang.

43:50.610 --> 43:52.909
Hey. What are you doing?

43:53.309 --> 43:54.880
Are you going in or out?

44:01.679 --> 44:03.690
He looks like\Nhe's shocked.

44:04.990 --> 44:08.320
It's the haunted house of\NJoongjin Police Station.

44:11.030 --> 44:12.130
I wonder...

44:12.530 --> 44:14.599
what he'll say about you.

44:14.929 --> 44:17.570
Why do you look\Nso excited?

44:25.110 --> 44:26.710
Who is this lady?

44:27.340 --> 44:30.409
I see. You're that\Nhonorary police officer.

44:30.979 --> 44:33.150
I hear you run around\Nthe crime scene...

44:33.150 --> 44:35.150
and play detective.

44:37.990 --> 44:39.690
Now you see\Nwhy Sergeant Yuk left.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.889
Mr. Hwang Jae Min?

44:45.630 --> 44:48.199
Yes. Do you recognize me?

44:48.630 --> 44:49.630
Yes.

44:49.729 --> 44:52.999
Do you want my autograph\Nor something?

44:53.740 --> 44:55.940
Yes, please.

44:56.099 --> 44:57.440
You're the genius\Nforensic investigator,

44:57.440 --> 44:58.909
Hwang Jae Min, right?

44:59.110 --> 45:00.579
I'm a huge fan of yours.

45:00.579 --> 45:02.280
I would've brought\Nyour book...

45:02.280 --> 45:04.809
if I had known that\NI'd run into you here.

45:09.720 --> 45:10.820
Come in.

45:16.019 --> 45:17.190
This isn't right.

45:17.460 --> 45:18.630
("Forensic Investigation\Nof the Genius")

45:21.030 --> 45:22.699
You meant\Nthis book, right?

45:23.199 --> 45:24.229
Yes.

45:24.229 --> 45:25.800
I'll give it to you\Nas a gift.

45:27.199 --> 45:29.809
But what's the name\Nof this brilliant lady?

45:31.309 --> 45:33.539
Brilliant? Lady?

45:34.280 --> 45:36.880
It's Yoo Seol Ok.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.110
Ms. Yoo Seol Ok.

45:40.479 --> 45:42.050
(Dear Seol Ok)

45:42.050 --> 45:43.690
(I hope you become...)

45:43.690 --> 45:45.889
(a great detective\Nlike Sherlock Holmes.)

45:45.889 --> 45:46.960
(From Hwang Jae Min)

45:50.260 --> 45:52.229
You shouldn't trust\Nthe rumors after all.

45:52.229 --> 45:54.260
Who made the rumor\Nthat you act up?

45:54.260 --> 45:55.900
I'm good\Nat catching culprits...

45:55.900 --> 45:57.429
which detectives can't.

45:57.429 --> 45:59.030
I think that's where\Nthe rumor came from.

45:59.030 --> 46:00.199
You often\Nare misunderstood...

46:00.199 --> 46:01.369
if you're better\Nthan others.

46:01.369 --> 46:02.940
I'm well aware of it.

46:02.940 --> 46:05.210
You can't act like you\Ndon't know what you see.

46:05.210 --> 46:07.110
You try not to\Nuse your brain,

46:07.110 --> 46:08.409
but you always stand out.

46:09.749 --> 46:12.010
You came here to ask about\Nthe case. Hurry and ask.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.679
Ask me anything.

46:13.679 --> 46:15.119
You found the bloodstained\Nfingerprints...

46:15.119 --> 46:17.320
on Yoon Mi Joo's shoe,\Nright?

46:17.490 --> 46:19.420
Which part of\Nher shoe is it?

46:23.429 --> 46:25.059
Looking at the angle\Nof the fingerprints,

46:25.229 --> 46:27.559
he grabbed it as he lay\Nprone on the ground.

46:31.130 --> 46:32.229
Here.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.199
If he had grabbed it\Non a standing position,

46:35.199 --> 46:36.340
It would've been hard\Nfor the fingerprints...

46:36.340 --> 46:37.470
to be horizontal.

46:37.639 --> 46:40.079
So he grabbed it\Nafter getting stabbed.

46:49.720 --> 46:51.349
You're good at saying...

46:51.349 --> 46:53.159
obvious things\Nshamelessly.

46:54.090 --> 46:55.960
Did he grab it\Nto ask for help?

46:56.019 --> 46:57.590
What, you think he grabbed\Nit to ask to kill him?

46:58.360 --> 47:00.460
Did you find any marks\Nother than the victim's?

47:06.440 --> 47:08.369
They're shoes\Nmade of PVC...

47:08.369 --> 47:09.610
produced\Nin Myungdo Factory...

47:09.610 --> 47:11.440
from 2014 to 2016.

47:12.409 --> 47:14.039
Slippers with\Nthree stripes.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.849
They usually cost\Nfrom 3 to 8 dollars.

47:16.849 --> 47:19.880
Those are the most common\Nslippers in Noryang-dong.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.889
Is it an examinee then?

47:23.550 --> 47:26.289
I have things to prepare\Nfor tomorrow's lecture,

47:26.360 --> 47:27.590
so I need to go now.

47:27.990 --> 47:29.690
Was I of help?

47:29.789 --> 47:30.829
Yes.

47:30.990 --> 47:33.159
What's the use\Nin helping civilians?

47:33.159 --> 47:34.800
You need to help\Ndetectives instead.

47:35.199 --> 47:38.070
Isn't it good for you\Nif it helps Seol Ok?

47:38.530 --> 47:40.639
I thought you two\Nwere going out.

47:40.970 --> 47:43.369
What? That's not true.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.470
Forget it.

47:45.809 --> 47:47.780
Where did you hear\Nsuch a rumor?

47:48.409 --> 47:49.849
Just do a good job\Nwith your lecture.

47:51.079 --> 47:52.280
I'll take this mark.

47:59.420 --> 48:00.920
(Restricted)

48:00.920 --> 48:03.329
Gosh, I shouldn't have\Nbrought you here.

48:04.159 --> 48:06.190
Why? I loved it.

48:06.190 --> 48:07.460
I got his autograph too.

48:07.929 --> 48:09.059
Thank you.

48:09.599 --> 48:12.199
What's this rumor about\Nus going out, by the way?

48:12.199 --> 48:14.240
Did you tell others that\Nyou live in my house?

48:14.240 --> 48:16.639
Don't mind it. They say it\Nbecause we're together.

48:16.639 --> 48:17.940
Then let's stay apart\Nfrom each other.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.809
Are you afraid\Nof the rumor?

48:21.039 --> 48:23.050
We're not having an affair\Nor something, you know.

48:24.979 --> 48:26.619
It's because of you.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.619
You're getting delayed\Nwith your promotion.

48:28.619 --> 48:31.019
It's not good to get\Ninvolved in a rumor.

48:32.490 --> 48:34.990
Then again, it'll harm me\Nmore than it does to you.

48:36.990 --> 48:38.429
What will you do?

48:39.389 --> 48:41.159
I'll go to Noryang-dong...

48:41.460 --> 48:43.499
and catch the culprit\Nwho killed Lee Wang Sik.

48:43.499 --> 48:45.300
You think the culprit\Nis in Noryang-dong.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.869
Does it mean Yoon Mi Joo\Nisn't the culprit?

48:48.599 --> 48:50.139
The hidden camera guy\Nwas in here too.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.869
It means he's not\Nthe culprit either.

48:52.610 --> 48:54.909
I didn't say the culprit\Nis in Noryang-dong.

48:54.909 --> 48:56.579
I just said that I'm\Ngoing to Noryang-dong.

48:56.909 --> 48:59.409
Goodness, I'm dying\Nout of curiosity.

48:59.449 --> 49:01.320
Tell me already.\NWho is it?

49:01.320 --> 49:02.849
I'm not 100 percent sure.

49:03.019 --> 49:04.720
Tell me if you're\Nmore than 90 percent sure.

49:04.949 --> 49:06.490
Stay away from me.

49:07.019 --> 49:08.760
Goodness, I'm so curious.

49:13.199 --> 49:14.229
Lady.

49:15.159 --> 49:16.869
Don't wear the apron.

49:18.170 --> 49:20.400
I got this amazing gift,

49:20.400 --> 49:22.199
so I can't\Njust do nothing.

49:22.300 --> 49:24.110
It's not right though.

49:24.970 --> 49:26.510
You've worked hard today,\Nso just rest.

49:26.510 --> 49:28.409
- Let's just rest.\N- No.

49:28.909 --> 49:32.610
Don't even lay a finger\Non my cooking today.

49:36.889 --> 49:38.190
I'll have to eat it.

49:42.860 --> 49:43.990
Are you done cutting it?

49:49.800 --> 49:51.499
I prepared\Na healthy meal...

49:51.499 --> 49:54.039
for you, Detective Ha.

49:56.710 --> 49:58.269
You want me to eat this?

49:58.269 --> 50:00.110
It's natural healthy food.

50:02.949 --> 50:04.110
Is it even edible?

50:04.110 --> 50:05.579
It's good for your health.

50:05.579 --> 50:07.479
Eat the roots too.

50:12.889 --> 50:13.920
What's this?

50:14.320 --> 50:15.320
Broccoli.

50:17.090 --> 50:19.030
You know it has an\Nanti-cancer effect, right?

50:22.760 --> 50:23.900
What's this?

50:24.400 --> 50:25.729
It's green onion kimchi.

50:35.840 --> 50:36.880
Why is the rice so sour?

50:36.880 --> 50:39.510
I cooked the rice with\Nmagnolia berry water.

50:40.019 --> 50:41.650
It's good for\Nfatigue recovery.

50:43.119 --> 50:45.050
You feel uncomfortable,\Ndon't you?

50:45.449 --> 50:48.690
Right, I spent\Nsome money for you.

50:49.090 --> 50:50.760
Especially on\Nthis ginseng.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.429
Is it ginseng sushi?

50:54.460 --> 50:57.400
Well, it's good\Nfor health.

50:57.400 --> 50:58.599
Hold on.

51:01.340 --> 51:02.340
What's this?

51:02.740 --> 51:04.610
It's bitter to eat it raw.

51:18.849 --> 51:20.490
(Joongjin Police Station)

51:25.960 --> 51:28.099
That natural healthy meal\Nalmost killed me.

51:34.070 --> 51:35.099
You look sick.

51:35.999 --> 51:37.210
Why don't you work\Nwith the promotion team...

51:37.210 --> 51:38.670
instead of working\Noutside today?

51:39.210 --> 51:40.340
Where are you going?

51:40.409 --> 51:42.309
Report to your superior\Nbefore you go.

51:42.309 --> 51:43.909
I'm going to Noryang-dong.

51:44.309 --> 51:45.650
What about your partner?

51:45.650 --> 51:48.320
He doesn't even talk to\Nme, so he isn't a partner.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.449
So...

51:50.289 --> 51:52.190
you'll keep investigating\Nwith that civilian?

51:52.190 --> 51:53.820
We need to catch\Nthe culprit.

51:55.260 --> 51:56.990
Will you keep working\Nby yourself like this?

51:56.990 --> 51:59.329
I caught culprits all\Nright like this so far.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.130
Don't you remember?

52:04.769 --> 52:06.570
You acted up to catch\Na robber alone,

52:06.570 --> 52:08.300
and your colleague got\Nhurt because of it.

52:08.470 --> 52:09.470
I got my points deducted,

52:09.470 --> 52:11.610
and the detective in\Ncharge got a warning.

52:12.369 --> 52:13.940
Are you doing this\Nbecause of that?

52:13.940 --> 52:15.340
Because you lost\Npoints then?

52:16.409 --> 52:17.909
- What?\N- Hey.

52:18.150 --> 52:19.479
I heard\Nthat you're known as...

52:19.479 --> 52:21.449
the handsome guy in\NJoongjin Police Station.

52:21.619 --> 52:23.119
Handsome guys like you...

52:23.119 --> 52:25.050
should help out\Nwith public relations.

52:25.590 --> 52:26.920
You should go.

52:31.159 --> 52:32.760
He's my colleague,

52:33.559 --> 52:35.599
so I can't order him\Naround as I wish.

52:35.599 --> 52:38.099
He's so disobedient,\Nand it's driving me crazy.

52:39.400 --> 52:41.269
Where did he hear that\Nhandsome guy thing?

52:52.349 --> 52:54.550
The culprit was the\Ngrandson as expected.

52:54.550 --> 52:56.990
Lee In Ho\Nis wearing a cast.

52:57.349 --> 52:59.920
He can't stab someone\Nin that condition.

53:00.619 --> 53:01.820
Maybe it's a fake.

53:01.820 --> 53:03.630
He seemed very hurt.

53:11.400 --> 53:12.800
When he got\Nout of the car,

53:12.800 --> 53:15.570
he tried so hard not\Nto touch his arm.

53:15.570 --> 53:16.869
Then why are we here?

53:16.869 --> 53:18.170
I have something\Nto ask him.

53:18.809 --> 53:20.639
But he doesn't seem\Nto be at home.

53:21.909 --> 53:23.909
What is it that\Nyou want to ask?

53:23.909 --> 53:25.610
I want to ask him why\Nhe got his arm injured.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.050
I want to know the reason.

53:28.280 --> 53:30.389
In Ho is rarely at home.

53:30.889 --> 53:33.220
He hangs out in Gangnam,\Nnot around here.

53:33.220 --> 53:35.360
May we know\Nwhere he is now?

53:35.360 --> 53:36.829
He must be at a club.

53:36.829 --> 53:38.860
He went out\Nwith his friends.

53:41.300 --> 53:44.229
Are there people who try\Nto steal items by the way?

53:44.999 --> 53:46.840
Sometimes.

53:46.840 --> 53:48.639
Not a case was reported\Nas theft though.

53:48.639 --> 53:51.409
We settle down\Nfor most of the times.

53:54.479 --> 53:57.780
He settled matters\Nwith them in this room.

53:58.679 --> 54:00.050
They must've\Nsettled things quickly...

54:00.050 --> 54:02.380
when they watched\Nthe CCTV footages.

54:15.599 --> 54:16.729
Why is it so expensive?

54:17.829 --> 54:19.030
It's from a luxury brand.

54:19.740 --> 54:21.470
It was a gift from In Ho.

54:21.470 --> 54:23.210
It was Mr. Chairman's\Nbirthday...

54:23.309 --> 54:25.039
a few days before he died.

54:28.240 --> 54:30.010
He bought that gift\Nfrom a luxury brand,

54:30.010 --> 54:32.610
but the cake is from\Na convenience store.

54:34.249 --> 54:35.479
You can see this?

54:36.220 --> 54:37.849
You've got\Nsuch good eyesight.

54:46.929 --> 54:49.159
I received the evaluation\Nof my lecture...

54:49.670 --> 54:50.970
you turned in\Nthe last time.

54:51.999 --> 54:53.639
I said that you can\Nturn it in anonymously,

54:54.099 --> 54:56.170
so it turned out to be\Nquite harsh and honest.

54:57.470 --> 54:58.470
Fine.

54:58.809 --> 55:00.440
Then let's take a look.

55:01.409 --> 55:02.409
Okay.

55:06.619 --> 55:09.249
"Your lectures are\Nboring and old-fashioned."

55:10.849 --> 55:11.849
Ji Dong Chan?

55:14.190 --> 55:15.420
Did you write your name?

55:15.490 --> 55:16.490
No.

55:17.429 --> 55:18.460
Mr. Ji?

55:19.960 --> 55:20.960
Are you surprised?

55:22.059 --> 55:25.070
I compared this with\Nyour previous report.

55:25.599 --> 55:27.970
Your handwriting gets\Nslanted downward.

55:28.039 --> 55:29.400
Goes lower and lower.

55:29.639 --> 55:30.970
You have a tendency\Nto be depressed.

55:31.269 --> 55:32.570
My lecture\Nmust've been boring...

55:32.570 --> 55:34.210
for someone\Nwith that personality.

55:35.479 --> 55:36.479
Am I wrong?

55:40.320 --> 55:41.320
Next.

55:45.990 --> 55:49.320
"The lecture isn't\Nfun or touching."

55:50.329 --> 55:51.329
Kim Soo Jeong?

55:54.860 --> 55:55.929
Are you here\Nto watch a movie?

55:56.570 --> 55:57.570
Look.

55:58.070 --> 55:59.999
Your "G" is rather pointy.

56:00.599 --> 56:03.309
You are opinionated,\Nyet you aren't consistent.

56:04.010 --> 56:05.869
There is no way\Nyou'll be a success.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.809
This is what we call\Na graphology analysis.

56:11.210 --> 56:12.210
Is this...

56:12.780 --> 56:13.979
still not fun?

56:16.619 --> 56:17.619
Next.

56:23.690 --> 56:24.760
Kim Kyung Mi.

56:26.190 --> 56:27.260
Yes?

56:34.400 --> 56:36.099
"A witty lecturer."

56:36.440 --> 56:39.809
"Time flies as I laugh\Naway in his lecture."

56:41.210 --> 56:42.240
Kyung Mi.

56:43.010 --> 56:44.010
Kyung Mi.

56:44.780 --> 56:45.909
Kyung Mi.

56:46.479 --> 56:49.050
Isn't he\NProfessor Kim Jin Woo?

56:49.050 --> 56:51.019
No, he's\NProfessor Hwang Jae Min.

56:52.320 --> 56:53.659
I got them confused.

56:55.990 --> 56:58.159
People who are highly\Ntrained in this field...

56:59.490 --> 57:01.499
can even figure out\Ntheir personality.

57:01.499 --> 57:02.999
But the basis of\Ngraphology is...

57:02.999 --> 57:05.670
to discern if two writings\Nare from the same person.

57:06.269 --> 57:07.269
Do you get it?

57:09.610 --> 57:12.070
Do you know why\NI ask you if you get it?

57:12.539 --> 57:13.780
You have to get it...

57:17.150 --> 57:18.479
because this is a joke.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.059
See? Get it?

57:34.860 --> 57:35.860
Is this funny?

57:35.860 --> 57:38.070
I used to run a shop,\Nso I just laugh first.

57:39.699 --> 57:41.300
Is this still not fun?

57:44.369 --> 57:47.240
Last year, all of\Nthe recruits were idiots.

57:47.240 --> 57:49.749
But I look forward\Nto this year's recruits.

57:50.550 --> 57:51.849
Open your textbooks.

57:52.349 --> 57:54.449
Shoot questions at me\Nif you have any.

57:54.820 --> 57:56.619
But don't\Nthrow them too hard at me.

57:56.920 --> 57:59.090
Because it'll hurt.

58:08.960 --> 58:09.970
That's Kyung Mi.

58:14.470 --> 58:15.570
(Thief)

58:15.570 --> 58:17.470
(1,000, 1,050, 2,000,\N3,500, 4,000 dollars)

58:19.809 --> 58:21.210
Did everyone here...

58:21.210 --> 58:22.479
end up coming to\Nan agreement?

58:22.479 --> 58:23.479
Yes.

58:23.979 --> 58:25.309
It doesn't matter\Nhow long it took.

58:25.409 --> 58:27.249
He always made sure\Nhe gets the money.

58:30.690 --> 58:32.650
They all want to become\Ngovernment officials.

58:32.650 --> 58:34.820
They had no other choice\Nbut to pay the money.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.690
He's stealing a lot.

58:37.690 --> 58:40.059
He definitely looks like\Nan examinee.

58:40.630 --> 58:42.499
His back and neck are\Narched forward.

58:42.829 --> 58:44.269
He's wearing\Nneutral-colored shirt...

58:44.300 --> 58:45.729
with sweatpants.

58:46.740 --> 58:49.099
Why did Mr. Lee In Ho\Nhurt his arm?

58:49.269 --> 58:50.409
Is he really hurt?

58:50.409 --> 58:53.309
Yes, I took him\Nto the hospital.

58:57.210 --> 58:58.210
Goodness.

58:58.449 --> 58:59.479
In Ho.

58:59.780 --> 59:01.280
What's wrong?

59:01.280 --> 59:02.479
Are you okay?

59:03.289 --> 59:05.349
I just slipped and fell\Noff of the stairs.

59:05.550 --> 59:07.559
Goodness, what are we\Ngoing to do?

59:07.559 --> 59:09.789
He said he fell\Noff of the stairs.

59:10.229 --> 59:11.990
He was hurt pretty badly.

59:12.559 --> 59:13.900
I took him\Nto the hospital,

59:13.900 --> 59:15.260
and I paid his bill too.

59:15.999 --> 59:16.999
His hospital bill?

59:17.170 --> 59:19.570
He said he lost his wallet\Nas he slipped.

59:19.900 --> 59:22.099
I got the money back\Nfrom Mr. Chairman.

59:22.240 --> 59:23.869
He slipped on a staircase,

59:24.110 --> 59:25.570
then lost his wallet?

59:27.110 --> 59:29.079
I smell something fishy.

59:33.780 --> 59:36.249
We just need to find a guy\Nwho wore these on the day.

59:37.650 --> 59:39.590
Didn't you hear\Nwhat the store clerk said?

59:39.690 --> 59:41.760
They sell about\N50 of these in a day.

59:42.019 --> 59:43.789
These three-striped\Nslippers are...

59:43.789 --> 59:45.760
the most common shoes\Nin this neighborhood.

59:49.999 --> 59:51.699
Can you please cooperate?

59:52.800 --> 59:53.900
One second, please.

59:59.309 --> 01:00:00.380
Different brand.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.050
Can you tell me\Nwhere batteries are?

01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:08.249
Over there.

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:10.050
There?

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:12.190
Right.

01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:14.490
You're studying for\Nthose exams too. I forgot.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760
You know,

01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:22.860
the other party\Nisn't the only one...

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.630
who gets hurt\Nwhen you stab them.

01:00:35.079 --> 01:00:36.679
The person who stabs\Nwill also get hurt.

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:39.849
That's why professional\Nkillers cut off...

01:00:39.849 --> 01:00:40.979
the back of the knife,\Nor cover it up.

01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:46.889
Do you have\Na Phillips screwdriver?

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.460
Wait here.

01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:02.639
When did you\Nhurt your hand?

01:01:14.079 --> 01:01:16.519
(Suspect 1, Yoon Mi Joo,\Na 3rd time repeater)

01:01:16.519 --> 01:01:19.519
(Suspect 2, Park Gi Beom,\Na spy-cam voyeur)

01:01:19.519 --> 01:01:22.659
(Suspect 3, Go Si Hwan,\Na dorm manager)

01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:25.860
(Suspect 4, Lee In Ho,\Nthe victim's grandson)

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.199
(Suspect 1, Yoon Mi Joo,\NSuspect 2, Park Gi Beom,)

01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:32.199
(Suspect 3, Go Si Hwan,\NSuspect 4, Lee In Ho)
