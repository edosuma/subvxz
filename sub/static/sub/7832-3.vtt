Dad, they aren't birds.

Sure, they are. They came from eggs

Mm-hmm.
It's a vicious ovoraptor.

16:51.243 --> 16:54.235
It feasts on bird eggs
and lays its own eggs in the nest.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.247
The unsuspecting mother bird
cares for them until the babies hatch...

16:57.349 --> 16:59.408

16:59.518 --> 17:01.850
[ Laughs ]
What a chump!

17:01.954 --> 17:05.320
It's already wiped out the dodo,
the cuckoo and the ne-ne...

17:05.424 --> 17:09.588

the titmouse, the woodcock and the titpecker.

How vile.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.230
The one thing that mystifies me is...

Bart, I'm sorry,
but there's nothing we can do.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.190
Your lizards are banned

Everyone thinks they're monsters.

Okay, that's exactly one moment.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.758
Oh, nuts!

19:58.864 --> 20:01.890
Wow. Did you know they had
those webbed flaps for gliding?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.628
Yes. But I was hoping
they didn't know that.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.169
Well, I hope you're happy, Bart.

You have no idea what kind of plague
you've unleashed upon this town.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.251
Our top story:

20:21.353 --> 20:24.584
The population of parasitic
tree lizards has exploded...

20:24.690 --> 20:27.158
and local citizens
couldn't be happier.

20:27.259 --> 20:31.093
It seems the rapacious reptiles have
developed a taste for the common pigeon...

20:31.196 --> 20:34.290
also known as the feathered rat,
or gutterbird.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.300
For the first time, citizens
need not fear harassment...

20:37.402 --> 20:39.962
by flocks of chattering disease-bags.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.143
For decimating
our pigeon population...

20:47.246 --> 20:49.840
and making Springfield
a less oppressive place...

20:49.948 --> 20:52.348
to while away our worthless lives...

20:52.451 --> 20:56.217
I present you
with this scented candle.

20:56.321 --> 21:00.018
- [ All Cheering ]
- Yeah! All right!

21:00.125 --> 21:02.958
Well, I was wrong.
The lizards are a godsend.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.188
But isn't that a bit shortsighted?

21:05.297 --> 21:08.664
- What happens when we're overrun by lizards?
- No problem.

21:08.767 --> 21:12.225
We simply unleash wave after wave
of Chinese needle snakes.

21:12.337 --> 21:15.500
- They'll wipe out the lizards.
- But aren't the snakes even worse?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.507
Yes, but we're prepared for that.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.578
We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla
that thrives on snake meat.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.580
- Then we're stuck with gorillas!
- No, that's the beautiful part.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.879
When wintertime rolls around,
the gorillas simply freeze to death.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.885
Hmm.

21:28.987 --> 21:32.081
I'm proud of you, boy.

Mmm. Loganberry.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.286
I don't get it, Bart.

21:38.397 --> 21:41.298
You got all upset
when you killed one bird...

21:41.400 --> 21:44.665
