WEBVTT

01:29.047 --> 01:30.506
Ridiculous.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.344
Do I gotta do everything around here?

01:38.723 --> 01:41.517
Three hours to go and
the dishes still haven't been washed.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.477
The drink cart hasn't been loaded up.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.646
The kids' gift bags haven't been sorted.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.523
And did we even get ice?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.859
Hello! Did we get ice?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.194
Alison, come on.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.071
Get with the program here,
we need to get moving.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.948
Where did you go
in the middle of the night, Donnie?

01:56.032 --> 01:58.325
Ah... I don't know. Never-never land?

01:58.368 --> 01:59.952
I woke up. You weren't in bed.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.537
Honey, we don't have time for this.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.622
The kids are outside doing God knows what,

02:03.706 --> 02:05.958
we got a million things to do
and you're not helping!

02:06.042 --> 02:07.626
Just make a list of what we need

02:07.710 --> 02:09.586
and I'll do it and when
I'm out getting the damn ice.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.963
I need to know where you went, Donnie.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.215
Look, I know we had a bad day yesterday.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.467
A bad day? Is that what you call it?

02:15.552 --> 02:16.593
Where are you going?

02:16.678 --> 02:19.847
I'm going out to get the stuff
that you were supposed to get yesterday!

02:24.561 --> 02:26.562
I'm trying to
have a conversation with you, Donnie.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.397
And oh, what a joy it is!

02:28.481 --> 02:31.775
But don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll talk about this later.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.901
It's all good.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.695
- Ah!

03:15.695 --> 03:17.988
My problems didn't start
in the military.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.576
They started out of uniform,
as a private contractor.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.288
Understand?

03:27.332 --> 03:29.249
I'm not doing any of this by choice.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.919
All right. So, they forced
you to be Beth's monitor

03:31.961 --> 03:34.129
for two years without even knowing why.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.008
Are you some kind of hustler?

03:38.092 --> 03:40.177
You understand leverage, right?

03:40.511 --> 03:43.722
The difference is you chose
to infiltrate Beth's life,

03:43.806 --> 03:46.558
to screw her boyfriend right on this counter.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.602
And you weren't even you.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.229
And you aren't you either.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.815
I don't think you understand
how serious this is.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.653
We need to try and be
honest with each other, twin sister.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.822
Okay.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.076
Let's see what happens to the results
of the medical test you performed on me.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.119
I wanted to get you away from that.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.955
I'm serious about Rio.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.957
Just tell me what happens to the results.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.377
They go to Olivier. From there I don't know.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.885
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.303
Wash off the filth.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.389
Is that okay with you?

04:28.768 --> 04:31.895
So do you think the results
might tell them I'm not Beth?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.856
I don't know what the tests are for.
I explained that.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.026
This is my world, Sarah.
It is you that I'm worried about.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.446
Yeah? What is it that worries you about me?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.699
Whatever it is you're not telling me.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.454
Sarah?

05:00.883 --> 05:02.426
Hey, Cosima, you were right.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.094
Paul doesn't even know about clones.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.804
See, it's a double blind.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.807
Um, the monitors are
unaware of the purpose of the experiment.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.892
That way they can't skew the results.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.144
Oh, hey.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.646
I just had to get out
of there. I don't even know where I am going.

05:14.731 --> 05:19.067
Right. I may have
a monitor dilemma of my own.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.154
Um, I'm new here, this semester.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.198
I didn't bring
anybody with me, but,

05:25.241 --> 05:27.451
uh, someone wants to be friends.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.037
Just stay away from them, Cos.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.663
--Stick to the science, yeah?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.081
Stick to the science?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.459
What am I, the geek monkey now?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.878
Seriously, Paul's a bad ass okay.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.421
He's ex-military.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.132
If somebody's trying to
get close to you just stay away.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.843
Right. The old "do as I say, not as I do."

05:44.927 --> 05:46.178
- Sorry...

05:46.262 --> 05:47.637
Look, Alison's calling through.

05:47.722 --> 05:48.805
Are we good?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.974
Sure.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.479
--Hey!

05:55.563 --> 05:57.272
- I need you.
- What's going on?

05:57.315 --> 05:59.941
Um... I have a situation.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.443
What kind of situation?

06:01.486 --> 06:04.237
- Just get over here right now.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.449
- Hey that's not fair!
- Oh, then I'll get you again.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.327
Okay, okay. You're gonna
walk your sister to Aynesley's house

06:10.411 --> 06:11.912
- and you're gonna stay there.
- But Mom!

06:11.954 --> 06:13.497
- Yes. it's gonna be fun.
- No!

06:13.581 --> 06:15.624
Go. Tell her I said it's okay.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.666
Where are you off to, Sarah?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.428
Ah!

07:13.850 --> 07:15.058
Alison?

07:17.562 --> 07:20.230
- Why am I tied to the chair?
- Shh!

07:20.481 --> 07:22.441
Tell me what was really in the box, Donnie.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.067
What?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.404
Your special box. What was inside of it?

07:27.572 --> 07:30.866
Are you out of your mind? Untie me.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.868
No. Donnie I have

07:32.910 --> 07:34.953
questions that needs answers.

07:35.037 --> 07:38.165
- Come on, Alison, this is insane!

07:40.042 --> 07:41.251
Don't worry, honey.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.128
It's all good.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.547
Isn't that what you always tell me?

07:50.970 --> 07:55.932
Think about what you
really want to get off your chest.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.394
Or what, you're gonna stick sequins on me?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.230
- You moved the files.
- Files? What files?

08:02.523 --> 08:05.567
Your files that you have on me from your box.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.235
Your special box.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.737
Ahhh!

08:13.117 --> 08:14.576
Have you lost your mind?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.036
I know what you do, Donnie.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.246
- What? What do I do?
- You spy.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.665
You perform
medical examinations on me in my sleep.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.042
- What?
- You turned my whole life

08:22.084 --> 08:24.044
into a big embarrassing lie!

08:24.086 --> 08:25.670
- Oh, no!
- And you switched the files

08:25.755 --> 08:28.006
in your special box for porno DVDs!

08:28.090 --> 08:31.426
- A Big Boob Blowies!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.010
Ahhh!

08:51.113 --> 08:53.073
- Hey, Delphine.
- Hey.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.784
- Bonjour Cosima.
- I'm bored.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.662
Well, you know, there's this lecture today

08:58.746 --> 09:01.289
that I was going to see... Wait, where is it?

09:01.332 --> 09:04.125
Um, I was going to.
If you want to come with me.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.048
Neolutionism. Really?

09:10.132 --> 09:11.466
You've... You've heard of it?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.219
Yeah, it's like kind of fringe, don't you think?

09:14.303 --> 09:18.098
Well, I think that,
as a Darwinist, it would interest you.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.102
And this Dr. Leekie is a really, really,

09:22.144 --> 09:25.272
I saw his TED Talk online and... Whew!

09:26.148 --> 09:27.315
Hmm.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.693
So...

09:31.946 --> 09:34.072
Sure. Why not?

09:41.163 --> 09:45.000
Sarah, I can understand
why you took off this morning, but I need...

09:45.876 --> 09:49.129
We need to know that
the ground beneath us is solid.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.007
So, please.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.677
Let's talk about all this tonight.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.563
Why do you do it, Donnie?

10:06.647 --> 10:09.357
Alison, I don't examine you in your sleep.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.776
Oh, no. No.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.070
Am I sick like the German?

10:14.363 --> 10:16.865
What German? Who's German?

10:17.658 --> 10:20.535
- Oh, no!

10:22.747 --> 10:25.415
- What the hell is going on, Alison?
- Shh!

10:25.833 --> 10:27.250
Please, no.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.044
What are you doing?

10:29.086 --> 10:30.211
Please. Argh!

10:30.296 --> 10:32.088
Alison, no!

10:40.473 --> 10:42.349
Hi. What's the emergency?

10:42.391 --> 10:43.808
Umm...

10:44.560 --> 10:46.728
You might wanna sit down for this.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.980
Uh... I'll stand. Thanks.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.315
Okay.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.901
Alison? Alison?

10:53.444 --> 10:54.903
- Who's that?
- Alison.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.780
- Donnie.
- Who's Donnie?

10:56.864 --> 10:57.906
He's my husband.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.784
- What?
- I think he's my watcher.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.036
- Jesus Christ! Alison, what have you done?

11:03.079 --> 11:05.538
Al? Yoo-who!

11:05.581 --> 11:07.165
- Hello?

11:08.209 --> 11:09.584
Who's that?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.294
- Oh!

11:13.130 --> 11:14.673
I completely forgot.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.595
- Hey.
- Oh, you're not ready for the pot luck.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.097
Oh, yeah. Umm...

11:22.181 --> 11:23.264
You're not even dressed.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.642
Well, I was just thinking,
could we change venues?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.686
Change venues?
Ali, what's wrong?

11:27.770 --> 11:30.355
I... Nothing, I'm just not...
I think I'm coming down with something.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.232
- I think we should...
- Well, it's too late now.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.818
So just take some of your
happy pills and let me help.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.986
Don't worry, we'll get this party started.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.321
Okay.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.615
- What's up, Hendrix?
- Mmm!

11:43.285 --> 11:46.037
Hello, hi. Hi.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.289
- Is this a pajama party?
- Good.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.800
- Ali.
- Hmm.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.052
- Nothing's ready.
- Oh, I know.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.303
Cover for me.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.472
- What's all off limits?
- Hmm.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.100
The basement.
Uh, it's a disaster.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.977
- Donnie's starting renos this week.
- Oh! Mmm-hmm.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.521
Well, the kids are screaming for chips.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.357
I'll go get some from the pantry.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.942
- Sausage rolls, freezer.
- Got it.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.318
Okay.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.117
- A pot luck? Seriously?
- Seriously.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.619
- Okay, you got to kick them out.
- I can't,

12:26.662 --> 12:28.538
back out of the monthly pot luck.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.082
It's my turn.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.210
And I have no gift bags, no ice,

12:34.879 --> 12:37.881
and no bartender because
my husband is tied to a chair.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.924
Alison, you need to take a deep breath.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.010
- I hate yoga.
- Okay.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.263
You need to go up there
and just play hostess like nothing's wrong.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.515
Fine.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.851
You interrogate Donnie.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.897
- What?
- Yes. You are the expert.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.193
Go in there and then get that
lying bastard to confess.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.779
- What... Are you serious?
- Be me. Put this on.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.113
What if he's just your husband?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.990
Sarah, I need you to help me with this.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.701
I impersonated you, in front of your daughter.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.870
Now it's your turn.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.167
With a golf club?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.128
No. No, I can't bartend.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.923
I've got a very handsome guest here.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.383
Please tell me you're not with
the morgue attendant again.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.177
No, but I plan to be.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.054
Hang on.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.556
Teddy, is that all you can handle?

13:33.062 --> 13:36.231
All right.
Looks like my afternoon just opened up.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.483
Okay. How soon can you be here?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.318
- To Scarberia?
- Yeah.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.779
- And dress suburban.
- You've got to be joking.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.906
I know, it sucks to be my sister.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.033
Don't forget the ice.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.911
Well!

13:51.163 --> 13:52.497
Okay.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.749
Kids are looking for the gift bags.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.334
And we're running out of wine glasses.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.585
- Where are your disposables?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.462
They are under the sink. No.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.632
Uh, top shelf, left hand side of the stove.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.884
I don't know. I don't know.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.052
What's going on downstairs?

14:06.929 --> 14:08.847
- Sausage roll?
- No, thanks.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.431
So...

14:12.142 --> 14:13.685
Meera wants to know
the name of your contractor.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.311
Oh!

14:15.813 --> 14:17.730
I will give you his info.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.898
- Perfect.
- Okay.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.441
--Sausage? No, okay.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.318
- That's all right.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.362
She's drunk already?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.573
--Whoopsie-whoo!

14:26.782 --> 14:28.199
Red chili. Did you want one?

14:28.784 --> 14:30.118
And where the hell's Donnie?

14:31.203 --> 14:34.163
Hello, Donnie.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.623
Donnie.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.489
Hello, Donnie.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.116
- Alison.
- Shh!

15:15.748 --> 15:18.124
- Can we stop now, please?
- Yes.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.001
After a few questions.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.588
You told me yesterday she was fine.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.841
She's right back in her dark place, Olivier.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.428
Stopped her from OD-ing on pills last night.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.681
She's quit the force,
dumped her therapist. She has no one else.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.685
She has you
to share in this crisis like any other event.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.272
Don't interfere unless it's critical.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.321
I need to know that
I won't be blamed if she tries it again.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.740
If I can't stop her.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.202
You've done well for us, Paul.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.916
A long as your subject makes her own
choices there are no wrong decisions.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.043
Yes?

16:03.087 --> 16:05.546
Then, so long as you're on.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.140
I know, Donnie. So you can...

16:16.976 --> 16:18.768
Tell me how it works.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.728
How what works?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.063
The double blind.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.898
Monitoring.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.150
Alison, would you listen to yourself?

16:27.403 --> 16:30.405
I got up in the middle of the night
to watch cricket!

16:30.739 --> 16:31.990
Cricket?

16:32.408 --> 16:35.243
The South African games start at 4:00 a.m.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.080
ls there nothing in my life
left unexamined by you?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.749
Now take off the GD blindfold!

16:44.378 --> 16:46.212
The whole neighborhood is here?

16:46.255 --> 16:50.258
What kind of irrational nonsense
is going through that head of yours!

16:50.342 --> 16:52.051
Hey, watch your tone, Donnie.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.930
Alison, get your frazzled
PMS shit together!

16:55.973 --> 16:58.016
Hey! You watch your tone!

16:58.100 --> 17:00.309
Your wife is the rock of this family.

17:00.394 --> 17:03.104
You will no longer speak down to her.
Am I clear?

17:03.689 --> 17:04.771
Yeah.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.608
- Cosima? Hey.
- Hey.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.778
- I am so glad you came.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.113
You won't be disappointed.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.366
Yeah, I can tell.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.536
Yeah. Dr. Leekie attracts diverse thinkers.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.246
- Come.
- Okay.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.459
Oh.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.627
Neolution,

17:28.589 --> 17:31.466
a philosophy of today for tomorrow.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.721
Rooted in our past,
in the evolution of the human organism.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.476
But before we go to the future,
let me take you back

17:41.560 --> 17:43.019
3,000 years,

17:43.103 --> 17:48.191
to the great, Greek philosopher,
Plato, and his twilight years.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.986
Poor old Plato was going blind.

17:53.155 --> 17:57.867
Going lame and
losing his hearing.

17:58.702 --> 18:02.997
Now, imagine if he knew
we could correct his sight,

18:03.082 --> 18:08.711
restore his hearing and replace
his ailing body parts with titanium ones.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.673
Plato would have thought
we were gods. But we're not.

18:12.758 --> 18:17.136
We're just fundamentally
flawed human beings.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.893
Your glasses, for example,

18:23.977 --> 18:27.438
make you somewhat, um... Platonic.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.649
But within the very near future,

18:29.691 --> 18:31.734
I'll be able to offer you the ability

18:31.819 --> 18:36.572
to see into a spectrum
never before seen by the naked eye.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.909
Infrared, X-rays, ultraviolet.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.955
- You interested?
- Maybe I'll just start with basic LASIK.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.710
And so you should.
That's making an evolutionary choice.

18:49.962 --> 18:55.216
Neolution gives us
the opportunity at a self-directed evolution.

18:55.551 --> 19:01.097
And I believe that's not only
a choice but a human right.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.510
Oh, Felix, Felix, Felix.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.933
All right, Felix.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.936
Time to party with the party.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.154
- Hello.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.656
Oh, shit! I totally thought you were Alison.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.286
Have you looked in the mirror?
There's a thing on your head.

20:06.079 --> 20:09.415
Shit, as they say,
it's completely sideways, Fe.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.583
What do you need?

20:13.795 --> 20:15.296
- Crackers.
- Hmm.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.174
- What?
- Do you have any crackers?

20:18.842 --> 20:21.719
How should I know, Charity? Why don't you
go check the cracker cupboard.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.012
Alison.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.891
Meera is talking. Where is Donnie?

20:27.976 --> 20:29.477
Oh, my God.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.312
Why isn't he helping you with this?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.022
He's tied up.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.484
Ali, don't you dare cover for him.
Not again and not to me.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.652
- Hmm.
- You know what I've been

20:37.694 --> 20:38.819
going through with Chad.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.988
Hey, ladies.
- Incoming.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.533
I am all over those sexy stretches.
You've been working your glutes again.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.910
What's your program?

20:45.994 --> 20:48.788
Why is everybody asking me
so many goddamn questions?

20:48.830 --> 20:51.874
Hello, neighbors. Your bartender's here.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.668
I'm just gonna have
a quick word with our hostess

20:53.752 --> 20:56.837
and then I'm gonna be right back to,
uh, top you up.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.339
Yeah?

20:58.382 --> 20:59.674
Let's go.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.846
It's a gay bartender, that's awesome.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.516
Chad, shut your stupid mouth
and feed the kids.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.315
No.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.900
- Oh.
- What the...

21:19.027 --> 21:20.611
I screwed up, didn't I?

21:21.738 --> 21:22.738
It's not Donnie.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.115
He said he didn't...

21:24.199 --> 21:25.199
it's not him.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.201
But I whacked him and it felt so good.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.577
Is he really in there?

21:28.912 --> 21:30.413
Yeah, tied to a chair.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.583
Oh, my God. Okay. I'll go
handle the mess upstairs.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.960
Right.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.045
I tortured my husband.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.381
I messed up my family.

21:41.925 --> 21:45.344
And you're the only person I can talk to
and you're just another version of me.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.305
Come on.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.142
I'm a horrible person.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.395
I'm not even a real person.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.440
Of course you are. Look, you
stood up to all this so far.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.610
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.989
Alison.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.783
Donnie says that he got up
in the middle of the night to watch cricket.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.828
- Cricket?
- Yeah.

22:10.954 --> 22:14.206
Look, Paul's military. He's a professional.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.916
You've known Donnie since what?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.335
High school.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.755
Right. High school.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.007
Yeah. So how could he be your monitor?

22:23.342 --> 22:24.967
So he's just Donnie?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.596
Eating, farting Donnie?

22:32.142 --> 22:34.769
My monitor is probably
one of those bitches upstairs.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.064
Alison, just...

22:39.649 --> 22:40.649
Alison!

23:01.129 --> 23:02.963
- I know. I know.
- Okay.

23:03.006 --> 23:07.301
No. No, no. Neolution is not eugenical.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.470
Okay, so what is it? Is it utopian?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.555
Neotopian maybe?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.724
Cosima. Oh, my God, look.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.602
There he is.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.187
I would just love to meet him.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.689
Come on.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.067
Okay.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.777
Don't worry. Go.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.447
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.490
Uh...

23:43.004 --> 23:44.296
Oui.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.631
You speak French?

23:45.674 --> 23:49.343
Oui. I have a neuro-lingual chip.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.345
Bullshit.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.681
Good. A skeptic.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.308
Neural implants are something
we're exploring however.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.935
At the DIAD institute.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.186
- You've heard of us.
- Yes.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.481
Um, are they from the DIAD institute?

24:02.524 --> 24:05.109
Oh, my "freaky-Leekies"

24:05.193 --> 24:07.319
as they've been dubbed in the media.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.239
It was once asked
what my perfect human would look like.

24:10.365 --> 24:14.785
I offhandedly suggested
silver-gray hair and one white eye.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.037
- Little did I know...

24:17.080 --> 24:18.914
Well, I enjoyed your lecture very much.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.916
Oh, thank you so much, thank you.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.543
You know, I'm in immunology.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.253
Hmm.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.629
And you?

24:25.714 --> 24:27.131
Um, evo-devo.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.718
So whenever somebody talks about
the future I always say, "Show. Don't tell."

24:32.888 --> 24:34.305
I hope you'll give me the chance.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.978
Please, have a look at our work at DIAD.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.731
Adieu.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.694
You are such a brat.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.241
No!

24:54.659 --> 24:56.744
Come on, let's get out of here. Come on.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.216
Hmm. Alison.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.884
Want a pint of Chablis?

25:11.927 --> 25:13.219
It's me, Fe.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.262
Oh, shit, sorry, I'm...

25:15.347 --> 25:18.265
- Code red, Alison just went down in a heap.
- No.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.559
We need to get her life
out of the fire somehow.

25:20.602 --> 25:24.230
Okay, listen. I think that
I may have spotted her real monitor.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.232
- What?
- Yeah.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.153
- There you are.
- Here I am.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.404
What is with you?

25:32.614 --> 25:33.948
- Hendrix!

25:33.990 --> 25:36.033
- Hey!
- Nobody finds that funny, Chad.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.786
Oh, oh, easy. Just bouncing quarters here.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.413
Um, I've seen you before.
Do you work at the plaza?

25:41.456 --> 25:44.208
I don't do plazas.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.001
Oh. How do you two know each other?

25:46.294 --> 25:48.295
Oh, um, because...

25:48.380 --> 25:50.839
- He's, uh...
- I'm... I'm her acting coach.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.299
Felix.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.968
Aynesley, from across the street.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.595
You didn't tell me
you were getting professional training, Ali.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.472
Really? Hmm.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.892
Um, Aynesley, do you want red or white?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.269
So, um, what do you think?

26:04.187 --> 26:05.229
Um...

26:07.983 --> 26:09.316
You run so fast.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.194
- Did we lose them?
- Yes!

26:12.279 --> 26:14.989
Okay, so let's, uh, steal some bikes.

26:15.073 --> 26:18.075
- Oh, no, no, no, that's too much crime for me.
- Oh, come on.

26:18.159 --> 26:19.368
I have a class to TA.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.120
Oh, okay. All right.

26:21.162 --> 26:24.039
You know what's a very French thing to do?

26:24.124 --> 26:27.084
- What?
- After a jogging like this,

26:27.168 --> 26:29.003
we like to smoke a nice little cigarette.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.338
- Did you say, "a jogging"?
- Yes.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.340
You did. Okay, just checking.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.466
Do you smoke? Do you want one?

26:34.509 --> 26:37.177
- Uh, no, just pot for me.
- Mmm. Ooh, really?

26:37.262 --> 26:40.097
- Yes, I'm from San Fran so...
- Ooh.

26:40.181 --> 26:44.018
- I am gonna get you so baked one day.
- Mmm.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.354
Okay. One day.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.649
Okay.

26:50.984 --> 26:55.237
It's, um... it's really nice
to make a friend in the brave new world.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.658
- Yeah.
- I have to go.

26:59.993 --> 27:00.993
Okay, yeah.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.333
- Okay.
- Ciao.

27:07.584 --> 27:08.584
Bye. Ciao.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.525
Donnie. Sweetie.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.527
Um, I'm so sorry about all this.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.413
Please untie me.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.708
I can't until the party's over.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.044
I bought mulled wine.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.462
If I can help...

27:54.798 --> 27:56.298
While you're down here,

27:57.425 --> 27:59.134
I want you to really think about us.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.805
What we've got

28:02.889 --> 28:05.599
with our house and our kids.

28:06.643 --> 28:07.643
You don't wanna lose that.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.104
No.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.789
That is a really good look on you.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.428
- Yeah?
- You need to come upstairs, now.

28:43.638 --> 28:44.638
What's wrong?

28:45.432 --> 28:46.432
Vic is here.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.308
- Vic?
- Yeah.

28:50.603 --> 28:51.603
Hi, Sarah.

28:51.688 --> 28:54.148
If you don't come upstairs
I'm gonna start making friends fast.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.567
Okay, fine, uh...

28:57.318 --> 29:00.529
Not downstairs.
Upstairs bedroom. Two minutes.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.367
Beth.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.663
Mmm.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.290
No scar.

29:53.750 --> 29:54.750
Sarah.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.418
Are you Sarah?

29:56.836 --> 29:57.836
Mmm.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.589
Alison.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.093
You want some of this?

30:05.845 --> 30:08.555
Come to bed with me.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.608
Look at all this shit.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.651
Whoa!

31:04.946 --> 31:07.614
A stroller and a latte,
and you could even fool me.

31:07.657 --> 31:08.949
You have five seconds, Vic.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.243
Oh, yeah, or what?
You gonna call neighborhood watch?

31:11.870 --> 31:13.370
- Neighborhood watch!
- Hey, hey!

31:13.454 --> 31:14.705
Keep your voice down.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.081
You and I have unfinished business.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.292
Sit.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.129
So.

31:22.213 --> 31:26.383
You faked your own death
so you can move on to your new scam, hmm?

31:26.467 --> 31:27.593
Where are you now, Sarah?

31:29.804 --> 31:31.471
Sarah, it must be so confusing.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.556
You have no idea.

31:33.349 --> 31:36.184
You've got your money, Vic. And then some.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.228
Five measly grand
doesn't cover my finger.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.565
Or my "pain and suffering".
Whatever this scam, I want a cut,

31:41.649 --> 31:43.734
or I'm gonna blow
your whole charade wide open.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.695
Let's move this along. Yeah?
What's it gonna take?

31:47.113 --> 31:48.238
Look at them. Hey!

31:49.282 --> 31:50.282
Could've been our kids.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.661
You got the wrong room, pal.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.204
You must be Vic.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.125
- Yeah, and you are?
- Oi, hey, this is none of your business.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.209
Am I talking to you?

32:01.294 --> 32:02.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.213
What's she done this time?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.257
Ah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.343
Hey, she works for me. You talk to me.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.928
Oh, yeah? Is that right?

32:12.096 --> 32:13.096
- Whoa.
- Hey, Vic.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.349
- Whoa, whoa. Okay.
- Right, turn around.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.268
Turn around. Put your hands up.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.687
What do you want, Vic?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.272
Sarah and I have unfinished business.

32:22.857 --> 32:23.982
I want a cut of the play.

32:25.151 --> 32:26.151
I'm the taxman.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.362
Can't you see we're right in the middle of it?

32:28.738 --> 32:29.738
I appreciate that.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.615
Got a whale on the line.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.367
So, can we go somewhere else

32:33.409 --> 32:35.619
before someone walks in?
Talk out in the garage?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.454
Vic.

32:38.957 --> 32:39.957
Okay, after you two.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.550
Uh...

32:51.719 --> 32:52.719
Ali, can we talk?

32:52.845 --> 32:54.680
Excuse us, ma'am, but you can talk inside.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.015
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We got this, Alison.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
Alison.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.022
Who was that?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.359
Which one?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.695
The impossibly handsome one, obviously.

33:09.779 --> 33:13.073
Oh, a friend from university. College.

33:15.451 --> 33:19.162
Oh, God, Ali, I know
you're sick of hearing about Chad.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.083
--Uh, no.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.171
I think the asshole is having another affair.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.308
Slowly. Let's go.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.768
Uh-huh, move.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.520
Sit on the chair.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.815
Let's go, buddy, come on. Go, sit!

33:46.899 --> 33:47.899
Let's stand.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.735
I'm not gonna hurt you...

33:57.785 --> 34:00.078
it's that slut from spinning class.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.664
After he swore he'd never do it again.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.834
Are people talking?
Has he said anything to Donnie?

34:07.336 --> 34:09.420
No. No, not a word.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.467
Um, but every marriage has its little secrets.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.178
We all have them.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.598
I'm sorry. I know you and Donnie
are going through things, too.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.726
Hmm? College friend?

34:23.268 --> 34:25.312
I've... I should get back to the party.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.231
Your shirt.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.315
What?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.360
You've changed your shirt
since the party started.

34:32.862 --> 34:36.031
Oh. One of the
kids must have spilt something on it.

34:37.574 --> 34:38.699
One of the kids.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.952
I should get back to the kitchen.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.498
- You're acting very strange.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.208
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

34:58.679 --> 34:59.805
What do you want, man?

35:00.264 --> 35:03.016
- Huh?
- I want you to tell me everything about her.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.229
About Sarah?

35:10.191 --> 35:11.191
What're you gonna do with that?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.320
Huh? What're you gonna do with that, buddy?

35:17.698 --> 35:18.740
What's her last name?

35:19.325 --> 35:20.534
Manning. Sarah Manning.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.285
She have a twin sister?

35:22.745 --> 35:23.870
What?

35:24.705 --> 35:26.623
No, she doesn't have a twin. She's an orphan.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.001
You know Beth or Alison?

35:30.044 --> 35:31.086
Who?

35:31.712 --> 35:33.713
Listen, buddy, calm down, okay?

35:37.009 --> 35:38.426
I'm not trying to shake you down.

35:38.553 --> 35:39.928
I'm in love with her.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.888
I do crazy things for her...

35:42.390 --> 35:43.807
Calm down, man!

35:44.559 --> 35:45.934
All right, calm down, buddy.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.646
Close the door, Sarah Manning.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.820
Paul,

35:57.822 --> 35:59.406
he doesn't have anything to do with this.

35:59.448 --> 36:01.324
It's true, man, I swear to God, listen to her.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.743
Who's the woman on the couch inside?

36:03.828 --> 36:05.328
Look, he doesn't know anything.

36:05.746 --> 36:06.872
Why is her husband tied to a chair?

36:06.956 --> 36:08.540
Listen, man, I swear to God,
I don't know anything.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.624
Sarah, could you please tell him?

36:09.709 --> 36:12.169
Could you please call him off!
Could you call this guy off!

36:12.253 --> 36:14.296
- Be a man, Vic!
- I don't know.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.131
All right. Okay, I'm a man.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.593
You are putting me in a very
precarious position, Sarah.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.845
Can't have any loose ends with this thing.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.599
This guy seems like a very loose end.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.517
He doesn't know anything, Paul!

36:27.602 --> 36:30.437
Look, man, I don't wanna die, all right?

36:30.521 --> 36:31.980
Just calm down, please, man.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.107
Hey, Paul, I'll explain everything.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.527
Beth, Alison, I'll tell you what's going on.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.820
Just let him go.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.364
I swear to God I'm not gonna say a word,
all right? Not one word.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.283
Sarah, can you please
do something, God damn it?

36:43.326 --> 36:45.535
Look, look, I'll be honest with you, Paul.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.620
Mommy?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.040
- Got you, Mommy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.833
- Gemma, get out.
- Mom!

37:17.443 --> 37:18.610
Quick siesta?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.363
Hmm. I don't feel so good.

37:21.447 --> 37:24.032
Okay. Let's get you to bed. Come on.

37:24.116 --> 37:25.325
Okay.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.619
Oh, that's it.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.080
Okay.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.791
Watch your feet, Ali.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.501
Oh.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.795
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.343
Move.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.720
You and me end here, Vic.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.182
Never come back.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.687
Sarah, wait a minute.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.068
Alison, uh, I just came...

38:00.152 --> 38:01.736
Did you fly down here?

38:02.363 --> 38:05.198
- What?
- I literally just put you to bed.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.701
I... I got up.

38:10.538 --> 38:15.166
Oh. We still haven't met. I'm Aynesley
from across the street. And you're...

38:15.209 --> 38:16.209
Just visiting.

38:18.546 --> 38:24.759
Um, like I said,
every marriage has its little secrets.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.721
This one's between consenting adults.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.223
No one gets hurt.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.642
Um...

38:33.227 --> 38:37.439
Do you know what?
You're right. This is none of my business.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.663
Time to go home.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.358
Donnie.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.402
About my little, um,

39:24.445 --> 39:27.906
- breakdown, um...
- No. No, no, no.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.324
It's my fault.

39:31.827 --> 39:32.827
You're right.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.663
You are the rock of this family.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.085
I'm so sorry.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.670
Of course you knew.

39:43.464 --> 39:47.717
It wasn't just porn in my special box.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.887
You remember Ginny Neusbaum?

39:52.598 --> 39:53.598
From college?

39:55.476 --> 39:56.726
I don't know how to say this...

39:58.896 --> 40:00.647
But she and I had an affair once.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.942
Okay, twice. But you and I were broken up.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.155
We traded letters
for a few years after it ended.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.158
Dirty talk, mostly.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.664
Then she got lupus
and I never heard from her again.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.750
She got lupus?

40:22.837 --> 40:24.212
I don't know what happened to her.

40:27.508 --> 40:31.553
I'm so sorry. I was just
trying to hold on to something personal.

40:31.637 --> 40:32.637
Something...

40:34.390 --> 40:35.515
I'm sorry.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.526
Drink?

40:46.652 --> 40:47.652
Yeah.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.700
Talk.

40:59.623 --> 41:08.506
Clones.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.302
Well, we don't use the C-word.
That's Alison's rule.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.764
But, yeah, we're genetic identicals.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.558
Not triplets?

41:19.977 --> 41:20.977
Genetic identicals?

41:21.645 --> 41:23.271
Yeah, we count nine of us so far.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.362
That's what you do, Paul.

41:31.405 --> 41:32.906
That's why you were watching Beth.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.618
You monitor human clones.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.079
You should have just
told me that in the first place.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.137
Stay away from me.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.139
I have an offer for you.

42:40.432 --> 42:41.975
You have until midnight.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.435
If there was a club here
don't you think I'd know about it?

42:44.478 --> 42:47.063
Beth's paperwork is a mess.
It's like she's never done it before.

42:47.147 --> 42:49.732
So let's get forensics
to pull the hand. Run a fresh set of prints.

42:49.817 --> 42:50.858
All right, you gotta see this.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.987
The subject isn't
who we think she is. She's an impostor.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.155
Help make this right, Afghanistan goes away.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.659
I can tell you have
a very unique perspective, Cosima.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.494
- She's very cheeky.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.662
But that's why I like her.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.205
Detective Mark Bell.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.624
I need to talk to you about Beth Childs.
