00:05.305 --> 00:08.399
Turn around real slow, young fella.
Who are you and what do you want here?

00:11.811 --> 00:15.110
Are you from outer space?

00:15.181 --> 00:17.741
I've come to collect you, earthling.

00:17.817 --> 00:21.275
If we take away their water long enough,
the whole valley will be mine.

00:22.622 --> 00:26.786
- We're too late!
- There's a canyon about a half mile down the road.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.590
We just gotta get there
before the water does.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world...

00:46.880 --> 00:49.940
of a man who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:12.899 --> 02:17.302
Watch it, you jerk!
You wanna blow us all to kingdom come!

02:17.370 --> 02:19.201
I wouldn't do that, Alex.

02:19.272 --> 02:23.675
And we're all here celebrating
because of Miss Wade and Mr. Miles.

02:23.743 --> 02:27.042
Without their help,
we'd be in deep trouble,

02:27.113 --> 02:29.411
dried out by Herb Bremen.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.246
But, boy, I gotta tell ya,
when I saw a lady lawyer...

02:32.318 --> 02:36.846
from the Foundation for Law and Government
was representin' us in our case,

02:36.923 --> 02:39.687
I really got a little nervous there.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.922
But seriously, folks, seriously,
they did a bang-up job.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.523
We've finally beaten Bremen.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.160
Just hurry up.
Let's plant this and get out ofhere.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.137
If Bremen knew that you brought
your brother along, he'd fire us both.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.607
Come on. Come on.

03:02.815 --> 03:07.752
And according to the courts, our water finally
belongs to who it should belong to... us.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.425
Let's just hope you're right.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.518
What's that supposed to mean?

03:15.595 --> 03:19.588
Only that for the last year, Bremen's
been trying to steal our rights legally.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.033
Now that he can't, who knows
what tactics he might resort to.

03:23.102 --> 03:27.505
Gee, Grandpa, what's Mom so
mad about? We won, didn't we?

03:27.574 --> 03:30.441
Well, in court we did.
That's right, Kev.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.978
But, you see, in the real world,
it's not that way.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.986
Miss Wade, Mr. Miles,
we'd all just like to present you...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.284
with a little token
of our appreciation.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.620
Oh.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.621
Thank you.

03:50.697 --> 03:55.634
I'm sure I speak for all of my colleagues at the
Foundation who worked so diligently on this matter.

03:55.702 --> 04:00.298
It has been a privilege
to represent you in this fight.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.671
And it's a special pleasure to win.

04:05.211 --> 04:09.739
Now I'm sure Mr. Miles would like
to thank you all personally. Devon?

04:09.816 --> 04:15.186
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it really has been
a very great pleasure to have been able to help you.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.815
That, after all, is what
the Foundation is about.

04:18.891 --> 04:23.123
And we certainly appreciate
your kind, uh, gift.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.824
It has been my experience
in the past...

04:27.100 --> 04:30.263
What the hell was that?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.672
It looks like it's near
the catchment basin!

04:41.748 --> 04:44.376
It isn't near the catchment basin.
It is the catchment basin!

04:46.019 --> 04:50.649
I warned you all Bremen wouldn't give up so
easily, but you thought I was just paranoid.

04:50.723 --> 04:55.057
Well, Mr. Miles, your legal victory doesn't
mean diddly if they cut off our water.

04:55.128 --> 04:59.189
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, first we better go fix the basin and fast.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.561
Do you think they'll want
their trophy back?

05:08.608 --> 05:13.409
We may have left these people with an even more
serious problem than they had to begin with.

05:13.479 --> 05:18.007
- Do you have any ideas?
- Only one. Michael Knight.

05:18.084 --> 05:22.817
Anyway, as I was saying,
we just won a lawsuit...

05:22.889 --> 05:27.656
that will enable eight small ranches to keep
the water that rightfully belongs to them.

05:27.727 --> 05:31.663
However, the plaintiff, one Herb Bremen,
now seems determined...

05:31.731 --> 05:36.498
to resort to illegal acts
to deprive them of that water.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.538
- And you want me to stop him, right?
- Exactly.

05:39.605 --> 05:42.574
For how long? I mean, I can go up there
and stop him for a month or a week,

05:42.642 --> 05:44.667
but how do we stop him permanently?

05:44.744 --> 05:47.611
That's no problem.
I'm attempting to get a peace bond,

05:47.680 --> 05:50.444
which is an injunction
against this sort of harassment.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.747
- Meaning? - Meaning that if
there is any more hanky-panky,

05:53.820 --> 05:57.051
the courts will hold Herb Bremen
personally responsible.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.853
So you want me to cover you guys
till you get this peace bond?

05:59.926 --> 06:03.362
Okay, how long will that take? It could
take anywhere from a week to 10 days,

06:03.429 --> 06:06.455
depending upon how much
of a stiff the judge is.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.865
All right. That doesn't seem to be
too much of a problem.

06:09.936 --> 06:14.600
All I gotta do is stop this Bremen guy
from messing with the ranchers' water...

06:14.674 --> 06:17.234
for up to, uh, 10 days.

06:17.310 --> 06:21.542
Well, it's slightly more complicated
than that, I'm afraid.

06:21.614 --> 06:25.311
Like how? We can't go into
court with dirty hands.

06:25.385 --> 06:30.618
Which means if the ranchers engage in any
extra-legal activity against Mr. Bremen,

06:30.690 --> 06:33.250
the judge will throw the whole thing out.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.124
All right. I got ya.
Where do I start?

06:36.195 --> 06:39.358
With Francesca Morgan.
She's not only their leader,

06:39.432 --> 06:42.401
she's also almost
as impulsive as you are...

06:42.468 --> 06:46.427
stubborn, rebellious
constantly indignant.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.636
As a matter of fact, I can't think of
two people who deserve each other more.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.975
All right, I got it. Stop him, stop her,
make sure no one gets hurt.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.276
You got it.
See ya.

06:56.349 --> 07:01.082
All finished. What have
you done to the monster now?

07:04.090 --> 07:06.024
Yeah.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.721
I've just increased
his capabilities enormously.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.527
You see, you just push
this button. Uh-huh.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.866
And a grappling hook
shoots out the back. Really?

07:22.175 --> 07:26.509
My! What a remarkable
fisherman KITT would make.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.610
Give him a chance
to cool down, Sam.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.242
We had a good ride.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.656
So?
Piece of cake, boss.

08:11.724 --> 08:15.091
Real clean operation, Mr. B.
It should stop 'em for a while.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.324
I hope you're right, Alex.
I don't like losing.

08:18.397 --> 08:21.764
Like the lawsuit I filed. I should've
made sure of the judge in the first place.

08:31.310 --> 08:35.837
Francesca, my dear.
I see you took the shortcut.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.681
- Just like you do all the time, Herb.
- It's good to see you. Come on in. Have a drink.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.015
I'm here for one reason,
and one reason only...

08:42.087 --> 08:44.022
to serve notice on you.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.115
We beat you in court,
and now you're playin'dirty.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.753
Well, you're not foolin' anybody,
and you're not gettin' away with it!

08:49.829 --> 08:52.457
Back off, Herb.
I'm warnin' ya.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.023
Just back off!

08:59.605 --> 09:01.573
Now there's a pain
we can deal with.

09:01.641 --> 09:04.337
Let me at her.
She thinks she owns the whole world.

09:04.410 --> 09:09.473
Don't underestimate her. She's got more guts than
the rest of 'em, and she's their rallying point.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.279
But I think if we take away
their water long enough,

09:12.351 --> 09:14.751
the whole valley
will be mine by default.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.880
Tell Mr. Bremen that
the Knight Foundation...

09:17.957 --> 09:21.085
is sending out some special hotshot
out to help the ranchers.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.810
Oh, Pop, how's it going?

09:45.885 --> 09:49.912
Oh, it's rough. But with a little luck,
we oughta have it repaired by sundown.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.924
Ma, are we gonna let Bremen
get away with this?

09:52.992 --> 09:56.086
- No, honey, we're not.
- Then what are we gonna do?

09:56.162 --> 09:59.689
I don't know yet,
but I'll think of something.

09:59.765 --> 10:05.169
Kevin, they had a problem just like this
in a place called Lincoln County in 1870.

10:05.237 --> 10:08.070
What'd they do, Grandpa?
Well, it's a long story,

10:08.140 --> 10:12.008
so walk with me over here,
and I'll tell you all about it.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.228
Morning, KITT. I gotta tell you...

10:40.306 --> 10:42.331
you're better than any hotel.

10:42.408 --> 10:46.674
That was a great night's sleep
and a, uh, a terrific dream.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.805
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself,
Michael.

10:54.820 --> 11:00.087
I believe we have a problem. I've picked up
some very large metallic objects directly ahead.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.992
Okay, I'm gonna take over.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.666
That's the car! It says "KNIGHT."

11:20.012 --> 11:22.845
Bremen heard he was comin'
to help the ranchers.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.181
Do you get the feeling they're a little
hostile? Feelings don't enter into it.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.280
I can think of no friendly reason
for their present deployment.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.349
Have we got room to jump?
Of course we can jump.

11:34.427 --> 11:37.021
But I can't guarantee
where or how we'll land.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.106
Easy as squishin' a bug.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.548
He can't get outta here now!

12:16.802 --> 12:19.464
Are they serious?

12:19.538 --> 12:22.336
They don't know you like I do.
Now, KITT!

12:22.408 --> 12:25.639
- Like this, Michael?
- Just like this.

12:44.897 --> 12:49.300
That was a close one.
I wonder how they knew we were coming?

12:49.368 --> 12:52.269
Are you positive it was
a deliberate assault on us?

12:52.338 --> 12:55.273
- No question about it.
- How can you be so sure?

12:55.341 --> 12:58.037
Because earthmovers
don't mate this time of year.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.667
Easy!

13:22.735 --> 13:25.863
Turn around real slow, young fella.
Keep those hands showin;

13:25.938 --> 13:28.805
Now, who are you
and what do you want here?

13:28.874 --> 13:32.537
I'm not looking for a part
in a western, especially the bad guy.

13:32.611 --> 13:36.240
I'm Michael Knight.
Devon Miles asked me to stop by.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.546
Harry, get over here! Come on, Harry!

13:41.620 --> 13:44.589
If you've got some I.D,
I'd like to see it, please.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.023
Yes, sir. Sir, I do.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.834
He's all right, Fran.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.929
That remains to be seen.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.065
Sorry to be so inhospitable, son,

14:03.142 --> 14:06.270
but things have been mighty tense
around these parts.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.439
- Welcome to the Double-M Ranch.
- Thank you.

14:09.515 --> 14:14.179
I'm Josh Morgan, and this is my
daughter-in-law, Fran, and my grandson, Kevin.

14:16.455 --> 14:19.083
Gee, what a neat car!

14:21.293 --> 14:24.228
- You like it, huh?
- Sure beats the cars we got around here.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.264
Well, I've got work to do, Mr. Knight.

14:26.332 --> 14:30.359
If you want to talk,
you'll have to talk in the barn.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.738
You comin', Kevin?
In a minute, Gramp.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.797
Just wanna take another look.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.747
Hey, Mr. Knight,
do you wanna go see my mare?

14:42.815 --> 14:46.114
- Sure. But you gotta call me Michael, okay?
- Okay.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.447
Okay.

14:53.058 --> 14:57.927
Harry, go away.
I am not a tree.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.400
Dog, what do you think you're doing?
I'm not a fire hydrant.

15:05.471 --> 15:09.168
Some days there's just no winning.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.176
This is my horse, Terra.
She's due any day now.

15:12.244 --> 15:16.271
Boy, she's real pretty, Kevin,
like she'd throw a great foal.

15:21.987 --> 15:26.481
The reason I'm here... Devon Miles
suggested I might be of some help.

15:26.558 --> 15:29.425
Just what we need...
Another lawyer.

15:29.495 --> 15:33.090
Listen, I'm not a lawyer. I heard
you've been having some problems.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.827
But if you're not interested in me
helping you, I'll be happy to leave.

15:36.902 --> 15:40.804
Kevin, go change your clothes. We'll be
leaving for the basin in a few minutes.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.205
All right, Mom.

15:43.275 --> 15:48.076
Look, Mr. Knight, if we can't
solve this problem ourselves,

15:48.147 --> 15:51.310
just what the hell good
is one man like you gonna be?

15:51.383 --> 15:53.544
Oh, come on, Fran!

15:53.619 --> 15:57.612
Mr. Knight, in this part of the country,
water is more valuable than land.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.625
We run about 6,000 head of cattle
between eight spreads,

16:00.693 --> 16:03.457
and each head needs 14 gallons a day.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.498
Fourteen gallons a day.
That's 84,000 gallons a day,

16:06.565 --> 16:09.830
each day, 365 days a year.

16:09.902 --> 16:13.565
Even without Herb Bremen's interference,
we're barely managing to survive.

16:13.639 --> 16:18.076
We've had a dry winter two years running,
and our acre feet are down 30 percent.

16:18.143 --> 16:22.307
Now, just how do you propose to help us?

16:22.381 --> 16:27.318
Look, uh, I think I'll be better at
fixing Mr. Bremen's wagon than you are.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.752
Look, Mr. Knight, you do your spying,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.586
or whatever it is you do,
and leave the rest to me.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.593
I've got my own idea how things
should be done. Agreed?

16:35.661 --> 16:38.960
- You got it.
- I'll see you at the basin later.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.761
Oh, by the way,
you can stay in the house.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.361
We've got plenty of room
since our help quit.

16:51.443 --> 16:54.003
Don't mind her, Mr. Knight.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.310
Oh, I don't.
I think she's kinda gutsy.

16:57.383 --> 17:01.547
Well, she's been livin' under a lot
of pressure since my son Billy died.

17:01.620 --> 17:05.112
Seems like she's fightin'
a whole war single-handed.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.954
And she almost is.
Been hard on her.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.223
I'm gettin' too old to be
much help. Kevin's too young.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.890
She's got this whole place
to worry about.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.560
I'd like to do what I can to help.
I bet you would.

17:16.635 --> 17:21.196
Oh, and by the way,
an acre foot is enough water...

17:21.272 --> 17:23.867
to cover an acre of land
with a foot of water.

17:23.942 --> 17:25.967
Oh.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.878
Or to flush 70,000 johns a year.

17:28.947 --> 17:32.212
Or enough to keep every head of cattle
in this valley watered for four days.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.912
Whichever is more important to you.

17:34.987 --> 17:38.753
So you can store your stuff in the house
there, and then I'll show you the ranch.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.917
You got it. Thank you.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.757
Michael, did you see
what that cur did to my tire?

17:49.835 --> 17:52.326
No. But I'm sure
the damage isn't permanent.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.339
It all depends upon whose tire it is.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.626
What are you staring at?

18:23.702 --> 18:27.160
I've just never seen anybody
take a bull for a walk before.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.400
You want some help?
No.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.841
I mean, it's okay.
I'd rather be alone.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.538
Just exactly where
are you taking this bull?

18:34.613 --> 18:37.776
I'm gonna teach Herb Bremen
a lesson he won't forget.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.784
What kind of lesson?

18:39.852 --> 18:43.015
Well, I thought I'd let old Bumper here
have a little fun for a change...

18:43.088 --> 18:46.057
with a real high-class
crowd of Brangus.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.787
Won't that destroy
the value of the herd?

18:48.861 --> 18:51.591
You catch on quickly, Michael.
Doesn't he deserve it?

18:51.663 --> 18:54.291
Probably. But that's not the
point. That's exactly the point.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.766
You're taking a chance
with every ranch in this valley...

18:56.835 --> 18:59.463
just to play a dirty trick on Bremen.
What do you mean?

18:59.538 --> 19:03.838
You pull off this stunt, you're jeopardizing
everybody's chances to get rid of Bremen the right way.

19:03.909 --> 19:07.174
In court, for good. Why?
To get even with him.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.714
That's pure self-indulgence.

19:09.781 --> 19:13.080
Who the hell are you to tell me
how to run my ranch or my life?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.712
You're just here on a pass.
You don't belong.

19:15.787 --> 19:18.051
Where do you get off
being judge and jury?

19:18.123 --> 19:21.991
I don't. I'm just pointing out a few facts
that you're too hotheaded to think about.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.730
And maybe too selfish.

19:26.798 --> 19:30.029
Oh, no! Bumper! Bumper!

19:30.102 --> 19:34.095
Josh, help!
Bumper's gotten loose!

19:34.173 --> 19:37.267
Don't worry.
Just get out of the way.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.578
Do something about that bull,
will you, KITT?

19:40.646 --> 19:44.207
A bull? Really, Michael!
You want me to chase a bull?

19:44.283 --> 19:46.808
I'm not a matador.
KITT!

19:46.885 --> 19:49.445
Very well, Michael.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.399
What's going on?
Who's driving that car?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.479
How's that car doing that?

20:14.546 --> 20:17.014
Toro! Toro! Toro!

20:17.082 --> 20:19.016
Who said that?

20:19.084 --> 20:22.212
I'm afraid it was the car.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.434
KITT, teach him who's boss!

20:45.510 --> 20:47.444
Ole! Ole, ole!

20:56.555 --> 20:59.456
That's the damnedest thing
I ever saw!

20:59.524 --> 21:01.685
You've got old Bumper scared silly.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.695
Michael, you may now take
the bull by the horns, as they say.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.062
Come on. Come on.
Come on there, guy.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.272
Well, uh, here's your bull.

21:17.342 --> 21:20.505
How'd you do that?
How'd that car do that?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.807
I see it,
but I don't believe it.

21:32.457 --> 21:36.917
Well, have you figured out
another kind of accident yet?

21:36.995 --> 21:39.520
It's not gonna be easy, Mr. B.

21:39.598 --> 21:44.399
From what I hear, the ranchers have established
24-hour patrols on the whole water system.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.437
I don't care.

21:46.505 --> 21:50.908
Even if we cut off their water for
a few hours, their herds'll stampede.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.206
Yeah, but what about the patrols?

21:53.278 --> 21:56.975
Well, in that case,
somebody'll have to get hurt.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.548
Keep that bag open!

22:23.842 --> 22:27.437
I was just showin' Mike here
what we gotta deal with.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.538
Well, as long as you're here,
I better fill you in.

22:30.615 --> 22:32.845
You have my full attention.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.682
The water runs down
that waterfall there...

22:35.754 --> 22:38.279
from the main reservoir
into this basin here,

22:38.357 --> 22:42.020
where it's distributed by gravity flow
to all eight of our ranches.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.029
How long can the cattle
go without water?

22:45.097 --> 22:49.056
Three, maybe four days.
But that's not the big problem.

22:49.134 --> 22:52.934
If you cut off their water
for even six hours, they'll panic on you.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.564
Cattle can smell water miles away,

22:55.640 --> 22:59.736
and the herds'll take off for it any way
they can, anywhere their noses lead them.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.904
You mean stampede?
Yep.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.107
And if you've ever seen one,
you'll never forget it.

23:04.182 --> 23:07.379
Well, looks like Bremen's
got you in a pocket, huh?

23:07.452 --> 23:09.386
Well, he's sure trying.

23:09.454 --> 23:12.287
Well, what can I do to help?

23:13.592 --> 23:16.459
For now, why don't you go
play with the cement mixer?

23:18.263 --> 23:20.197
Sure.

23:22.501 --> 23:26.460
You were kinda hard on him, weren't you,
Frannie? I mean, he did come here to help.

23:26.538 --> 23:30.941
Well, what kind of help can he be if he doesn't
know anything about ranchin' or farmin' or water?

23:31.009 --> 23:33.409
Well, that kinda depends
on what he does know about.

23:33.478 --> 23:35.639
Give him a chance.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.911
Unless there's somethin' else
you're not comfortable about.

23:38.984 --> 23:43.250
You know, Dad, sometimes
I think you missed your calling.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.984
You would've been great at quiltin' bees
with all the other gossips.

23:47.058 --> 23:49.652
Now, come on.
We got work to do.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.607
Time for bed, Kevin.
Oh, Mom!

24:07.679 --> 24:10.671
If you want, you can
show me around tomorrow.

24:10.749 --> 24:13.479
- I didn't get a chance to see much of the territory today.
- You'll drive?

24:13.552 --> 24:16.521
- You got it.
- All right!

24:16.588 --> 24:19.716
- Come on, Harry. Come on.
- All right.

24:19.791 --> 24:23.386
You know, Michael,
this is really our war, not yours.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.794
Bremen means business.
He hasn't killed anybody yet,

24:25.864 --> 24:28.594
but I think that's just
'cause he hasn't had to.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.966
Don't worry about it. I've been
in wars before, and I've survived.

24:32.037 --> 24:36.030
I didn't like 'em much, but I don't like
greedy, power-hungry people much either.

24:36.107 --> 24:39.304
So I, uh, think I'll take
a little look around tomorrow.

24:39.377 --> 24:42.107
Good night and thank you.
I gotta go.

24:42.180 --> 24:45.581
Mr. Morrow asked me to do
some guard duty for him tonight.

24:45.650 --> 24:49.051
Thanks for dinner.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.625
It's about time.

24:54.693 --> 24:57.526
You can't be impatient.
That's a human trait.

24:57.596 --> 25:02.056
I just like to know what's going on.
I'm only as good as my input, you know.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.931
I know, I know. I want you to stay
in surveillance mode tonight.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.733
We're doing some guard duty,
and I got a feeling.

25:07.806 --> 25:10.206
By all means,
listen to your instincts.

25:10.275 --> 25:13.073
I do. Believe me, I do.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.017
Good night, Mom.
Love you.

25:20.085 --> 25:22.315
Good night, sweetheart.
I love you too.

25:22.387 --> 25:25.652
Now, you sleep tight and don't
let those bad bedbugs bite.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.851
I think I'm too old
for that, Mom.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.520
Whatever, Kev.
Good night.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.470
He's a nice young fella,
that Michael.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.474
Mm-hmm.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.308
It's about time you started thinkin' about
goin' out and havin' some fun, don't you think?

25:47.379 --> 25:51.076
Papa, I'm your son's wife.

25:51.149 --> 25:55.051
- Widow.
- Michael's just drifting through.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.953
Come on. I haven't seen you
that lit up inside since Billy died.

25:58.023 --> 26:01.823
You are an incorrigible old romantic.

26:03.161 --> 26:06.392
Well, what's wrong with a little
romance once in a while?

26:06.464 --> 26:08.523
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, Papa.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.327
I love you too.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.928
See you later.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.559
Right on time, Mike.
Everything okay?

26:45.637 --> 26:49.539
Yeah, so far. But I don't really
expect any trouble this soon.

26:49.608 --> 26:53.169
Well, let's hope not. See you
later. Get some sleep, huh?

26:53.244 --> 26:55.178
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

26:55.246 --> 26:58.215
I really don't know why you're doin'
this, but we sure do appreciate it.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.615
It's all right. Good night. Okay.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.787
KITT, I'm gonna check around
the perimeter. Stay alert, huh?

27:08.860 --> 27:11.829
That's a redundancy, Michael.
I'm always alert.

27:11.896 --> 27:15.832
I know. I know. I know.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.367
Dewey and me'll take care of him.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.929
Well, what do you want me to do?

27:23.008 --> 27:26.307
Pick up the car.
It'll make a good souvenir.

27:41.526 --> 27:43.460
What is it, KITT?

27:43.528 --> 27:45.928
There are three men
moving about the area.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.158
One is approaching me
on the rear left.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.669
The other two are 20 yards
behind you, moving quietly.

27:51.736 --> 27:53.670
All right.

27:53.738 --> 27:57.936
You take care of your end; I'll
take care of mine. Of course.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.133
I suggest you remove
your hand, buddy.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.270
Who said that?

28:57.001 --> 29:00.266
Alex! Alex!

29:00.338 --> 29:02.738
Alex!

29:02.807 --> 29:05.298
Alex! Alex!

29:11.950 --> 29:13.975
It's alive! It's alive!

29:14.052 --> 29:15.986
Come on!

29:27.465 --> 29:29.695
Aren't we going
after them, Michael?

29:29.768 --> 29:33.465
No, KITT. We gotta stay here
and do some guard duty.

29:33.538 --> 29:36.837
What happened back there, anyway?

29:36.908 --> 29:39.706
You told me to take care
of my end, and I did.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.679
I don't think that person will ever
attempt to approach me again.

29:42.747 --> 29:46.046
The possibility ever occur to you
that you might have scared him off?

29:46.117 --> 29:50.110
Wasn't that the point?
Not exactly, no.

29:50.188 --> 29:54.181
Well, Michael, next time you want
something handled in a specific way,

29:54.259 --> 29:56.193
please be sure
to tell me ahead of time.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.662
I did manage to save us both
from harm, you know.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.700
Right. And you did
very, very good work.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.285
Whew! How's it goin'?

30:26.357 --> 30:28.723
Fine.
All quiet so far.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.785
Well, don't let up. We know Bremen's
gonna make another move.

30:31.863 --> 30:35.526
It's just a matter of where and when.
Come, baby. Let's go. Come on.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.681
Michael, where are we going?
Bremen's ranch, buddy. To investigate.

30:51.749 --> 30:55.708
- To investigate what?
- Well, if I knew that, we wouldn't have to investigate now, would we?

30:55.787 --> 30:58.255
- You call that logic?
- You got a better idea?

30:58.323 --> 31:01.554
How would you like to hear
a little music?

31:03.328 --> 31:06.354
Michael?
Yes, KITT.

31:08.366 --> 31:11.858
That person up ahead is the one
that tried to violate me last night.

31:11.936 --> 31:14.700
He's over the rise, about a hundred
yards ahead. The one who freaked out?

31:14.772 --> 31:18.230
- Exactly.
- We may have something worth investigating after all.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.243
You take over, buddy.

31:20.311 --> 31:24.407
I want you to pretend you're a U.F.O.
With a very unpleasant disposition.

31:24.482 --> 31:27.417
That may require considerable
acting ability on my part.

31:27.485 --> 31:29.612
Not as much as you think.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.598
Hey!

32:26.110 --> 32:30.513
Would you care to tell me why you were
running when all I want to do is talk to you?

32:30.581 --> 32:35.348
Who are you? What do you want to talk
to me about? I wasn't doin' anything.

32:35.420 --> 32:38.548
You were very offensive
last night, earthling.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.888
"Earthling"? Who are you?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.952
I don't really think you want to know
the answer to that.

32:45.029 --> 32:49.363
We have had some unfortunate prior experience
with earthlings who became too inquisitive.

32:49.434 --> 32:51.902
Are you from outer space
or somethin'?

32:51.970 --> 32:53.904
Outer space covers a lot of territory.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.840
Anyway, we're wasting time.
You'd better just get right in.

32:59.177 --> 33:01.771
Get in? What for?

33:01.846 --> 33:03.939
I've come to collect you.

33:04.015 --> 33:07.007
Y-You mean you wanna take me
out there, into space?

33:07.085 --> 33:10.816
That's right. Unless, of course, you have
some information you want to give me.

33:10.888 --> 33:15.416
- Like what?
- Like maybe what this earthling Bremen's next move is.

33:15.493 --> 33:20.192
Our supreme council finds his antics quite
amusing. I could get in big trouble if I told you.

33:20.264 --> 33:23.028
What do you mean, "get"?
You are in big trouble.

33:23.101 --> 33:28.539
I don't know anything, except it's got
something to do with the main water pipes.

33:28.606 --> 33:32.201
That's all I can tell you.
Just please go!

33:32.276 --> 33:36.269
Thank you very much.
I'll be seeing you around.

33:36.347 --> 33:39.544
Not if I can help it.

33:44.455 --> 33:48.551
- How did I do, Michael?
- Aw, KITT, that was beautiful!

33:48.626 --> 33:52.722
That earthling bit
was pure genius.

33:52.797 --> 33:56.198
Yes, I thought so myself at the time.
What's our next move?

33:56.267 --> 33:58.667
The pipes, of course.

34:27.031 --> 34:29.431
Get in position, Frank!

34:29.500 --> 34:32.469
That's an awfully impressive
piece of machinery, Michael.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.732
Are you quite sure
we want to antagonize it?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.502
We don't have any choice, KITT.
With one swipe of that arm,

34:37.574 --> 34:41.237
he can rupture those pipes, wipe out
the ranchers'water supply for days.

34:41.312 --> 34:46.181
Very likely. But I'm thinking of what
one swipe of that arm could do to us.

34:52.156 --> 34:55.784
- What do you intend to do?
- We gotta maneuver him away from those pipes.

34:55.860 --> 34:59.557
Hey, you! Move away from those pipes!

34:59.630 --> 35:03.532
He's gotta be kidding!
Move around, Frank!

35:03.601 --> 35:06.365
Easy pickings.
You bet.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.507
- Now!
- Got him!

35:16.681 --> 35:18.945
Frank, what happened?

35:29.293 --> 35:33.457
So far it's a standoff, KITT. We gotta
get that guy away from that pipeline.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.671
What do you intend to do, Michael?

35:40.738 --> 35:43.070
You know I'm not programmed
to finish off any person.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.110
The people aren't the problem.
It's the backhoe.

35:46.177 --> 35:49.578
Wait a minute. What about that
grappling hook Bonnie just installed?

35:49.647 --> 35:51.547
Good thinking.

35:58.856 --> 36:01.222
I'll get him this time!

36:06.097 --> 36:08.725
The retro-rockets, KITT?

36:08.799 --> 36:11.097
- Very logical, Michael.
- Thank you.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.275
Back up! Back up!

36:19.343 --> 36:24.246
I can't get away! He's towin' us!

36:24.315 --> 36:27.216
- Farm implements!
- Yeah.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.836
Nice horse.

36:46.904 --> 36:48.997
Nice car.
Thank you.

36:49.073 --> 36:52.565
I assume you're Michael Knight
from the Foundation.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.907
You're very well informed,
Mr. Bremen.

36:54.979 --> 36:57.948
Naturally.
What can I do for you?

36:58.015 --> 37:00.813
- It's more like what I can do for you.
- Meaning?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.944
I think we both know
what's going on around here.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.716
I just thought I'd tell you that
whatever you've got in mind,

37:05.790 --> 37:07.724
it isn't gonna happen.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.955
So what do you say we make life
easy on everybody...

37:11.028 --> 37:14.964
and leave the status
as quo as possible?

37:15.032 --> 37:17.592
You're very confident, Mr. Knight.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.831
It's better confident
than overconfident.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.174
These mean something?

37:24.242 --> 37:28.576
Yes, sir. You'll find your men handcuffed
to their machines up at the pipeline.

37:28.646 --> 37:31.308
That play didn't work either.

37:31.382 --> 37:33.316
See ya.

37:43.494 --> 37:46.930
Well, by tomorrow night, you should
have your injunction against Bremen,

37:46.998 --> 37:48.932
and that should be that.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.492
You just don't know him like I do.
He doesn't plan on giving up.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.835
What's the matter with you, Fran?
You worried about it?

37:55.906 --> 37:59.398
Not really about him.
I'm worried about Kevin.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.037
Kevin? Why?

38:02.113 --> 38:05.981
I'm afraid he'll grow up
like Josh or me.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.541
What's wrong with that?

38:08.619 --> 38:11.645
Josh still thinks
we live in the Old West.

38:11.722 --> 38:15.488
I'm not so sure we're the greatest
influence on him sometimes.

38:15.559 --> 38:18.323
You give him a lot of
love, don't you? Mm-hmm.

38:18.396 --> 38:21.263
A lot of discipline?
Mm-hmm.

38:21.332 --> 38:25.268
And a chance to be himself?
Most of the time.

38:25.336 --> 38:28.737
He'll be fine. How do you know
all this? You don't have any kids.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.366
Hey, I was a kid once.
I remember.

38:31.442 --> 38:34.570
I'm not so sure you're still
not a giant kid right now.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.079
You may be right.

38:37.148 --> 38:41.312
Michael, do you think
people can change?

38:41.385 --> 38:43.319
All the time.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.719
I've got this really bad temper.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.987
No kidding. I just wish I was
an easier sort of person...

38:49.060 --> 38:53.292
instead of always flying off
like a rocket first.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.662
I know it's not good
for Kevin or me.

38:55.733 --> 38:59.931
All you gotta do is figure out how to channel
all that energy into something positive.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.905
I think if I let go
of all that anger,

39:02.973 --> 39:05.464
I just won't be able
to cope anymore.

39:05.543 --> 39:07.511
It's the only thing
that keeps me strong.

39:07.578 --> 39:11.446
You can't be strong all the time.
Nobody is.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.211
- Not even you?
- Not even me.

39:14.285 --> 39:17.379
You know, Devon's always telling me
how impulsive I am.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.946
Looking at you,
I think I know what he means.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.551
You're right.
I know you're right.

39:23.627 --> 39:27.461
But now what I think I need
more than anything is a hug.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.624
Come here.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.655
Hi, Mom. Kevin, what are
you doing here this early?

39:51.722 --> 39:54.714
- Spent the night with Terra.
- I thought I told you...

39:57.328 --> 40:00.388
Never mind. I probably would've done
the same thing at your age.

40:00.464 --> 40:03.262
- Where are you going?
- Over to Bremen's.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.768
I can't stand this
cat and mouse game anymore.

40:05.836 --> 40:08.566
- I gotta find out what's going on.
- That could be dangerous, Mom.

40:08.639 --> 40:11.335
Don't you worry.
I'll be careful. Let's go.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.310
Don't tell Michael
I've gone to Bremen's.

40:22.853 --> 40:25.651
Your ineptness has left me no option.

40:25.723 --> 40:29.124
I have no time now.
If we can't drive 'em out,

40:29.193 --> 40:31.991
we're gonna have to
flood them out for good.

40:32.062 --> 40:37.261
I want you to blow the sluice gates
at the main reservoir.

40:59.190 --> 41:02.057
This time we're gonna do it right.
It's not my fault.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.651
It's that car, I'm tellin' ya.
It's a jinx.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.458
Never mind the car. All we gotta do
is make it look like an accident...

41:07.531 --> 41:09.761
opened those sluice gates
at the main reservoir.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.394
That oughta take care of the Double-M
and the rest of'em for good.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.802
Now, let's set those charges.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.843
Shut up and stop screaming.
You won't get hurt.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.151
Let me go!

41:33.224 --> 41:36.125
Let go of me!
I said shut up!

41:36.193 --> 41:38.286
Put me down!
Boy, she's a real fighter!

41:38.362 --> 41:41.354
Put me down!

41:49.206 --> 41:51.640
Come on! Hurry up!

41:59.216 --> 42:01.081
Bremen's got Mom!
Where is she?

42:01.151 --> 42:03.085
She's at his ranch.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.781
Kevin, why'd your mom go to Bremen's?

42:05.856 --> 42:09.292
She said she couldn't stand waiting
anymore and not to tell you.

42:23.607 --> 42:27.703
Okay, KITT, scan the interior.
See if you can locate her.

42:27.778 --> 42:30.576
Of course I can locate her.

42:37.821 --> 42:40.381
There are three people
in the southeast portion of the house.

42:40.457 --> 42:43.790
Several in the back, which
presumably is the kitchen area.

42:43.861 --> 42:48.423
- And one person in the pool house.
- That's gotta be Fran. Let's go.

42:59.877 --> 43:03.973
Mrs. Morgan, would you please
move flat against the south wall?

43:04.048 --> 43:06.573
Hang on!

43:22.600 --> 43:26.434
They're gonna open the sluice gates
and flood out the entire valley.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.494
That's where we're going.

43:44.755 --> 43:47.747
- Are you all right, Mom?
- Yeah.

43:47.825 --> 43:50.953
I'm just embarrassed
that I got caught.

44:52.456 --> 44:55.425
We're too late!
All this and we didn't make it!

44:58.495 --> 45:01.521
Don't be too sure about that.

45:01.598 --> 45:04.089
There's a canyon
about a half mile down the road.

45:04.168 --> 45:07.103
We just gotta get there
before the water does. Let's go!

45:37.401 --> 45:41.565
Michael, blowing the catch basin was
nothing compared to the main reservoir.

45:41.638 --> 45:44.505
Don't worry. We're almost there.

46:04.728 --> 46:07.026
Give me another round, buddy.

46:16.340 --> 46:18.968
Who'd believe it?

46:54.178 --> 46:58.877
Well, Mrs. Morgan, Bremen and his boys
are going to be in jail for quite a long time.

46:58.949 --> 47:02.715
So I guess we didn't do
so badly after all.

47:02.786 --> 47:04.811
No, Mr. Miles,
I guess you didn't.

47:04.888 --> 47:09.018
And thank you. I do hope you'll accept
our invitation to come back soon.

47:09.092 --> 47:12.152
I know Kevin will be very
disappointed if you don't. Just Kevin?

47:13.997 --> 47:15.988
How can he refuse?

47:16.066 --> 47:18.432
I'm awful sorry, Mom!

47:18.502 --> 47:20.436
Awful sorry about what?

47:20.504 --> 47:24.270
Old Bumper got out,
and I can't catch him!

47:24.341 --> 47:28.038
No need to worry, Michael. I've become
quite adept at this sort of thing.

47:30.347 --> 47:32.577
Won't you ever learn?

47:52.002 --> 47:55.267
One man can make a difference, Michael.

47:58.308 --> 48:02.711
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:02.779 --> 48:05.304
the world of the Knight Rider.
