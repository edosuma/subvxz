00:00.600 --> 00:02.300
Previously on "october road"...

00:02.300 --> 00:04.200
I haven't left this house in five years.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.200
Help me understand.

00:05.200 --> 00:05.900
Right now I'm fine.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.300
Now my heart's starting to race.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.600
Chest about to explode.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.500
Okay, that's enough.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.200
I understand.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.000
Miss you, buddy.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
You had sex with my wife!

00:13.000 --> 00:14.800
We will never be friends again.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.500
These your kids?

00:15.500 --> 00:16.800
Thursdays and every other weekend.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.900
Mom's a cobra.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.100
I can't put my life on the fantasy of what we were.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.200
Will you marry me,hannah jane?

00:21.200 --> 00:22.900
Hannah's a great girl and all, nick,

00:22.900 --> 00:24.500
but you two are past tense.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.600
You should get aubrey back.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.200
You should un-break up with her.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.200
You got a girlfriend,ronnie?

00:28.200 --> 00:30.300
Well's been dry for a while now.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.300
Bob, I have to take my vet tech recertification test four minutes ago.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.900
My babysitter fell off a stepladder and sprained her ankle,

01:54.300 --> 01:55.400
it's a beautiful saturday.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.500
unseasonably warm.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.700
Why are you guys indoors?

02:02.700 --> 02:03.400
I'm inside

02:03.500 --> 02:05.000
because the newspaper is.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.400
Ronnie's inside thwarting a martian invasion
because that's best achieved inside.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.200
When was the last time you
actually had a date, ronnie?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.000
I don't know.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.800
He you're a cool,good-looking guy.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.600
You shouldn't be in on saturdays playing video games.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Why are you picking on me?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.500
Leslie calls that "projecting."

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
It's when person "a" accuses person "b" of things
that person "a" is doing.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.800
Tonight... we go out,meet you a girl,

02:32.100 --> 02:33.500

Okay, whatever, man.
Pop, you want a cheese sandwich?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.600
Uh, no, mnh-mnh.
-Cheese sandwich?

02:37.600 --> 02:38.800
I would love a cheese sandwich.

02:43.300 --> 02:43.900
Okay.

02:44.100 --> 02:44.700

02:45.500 --> 02:46.100
Thanks.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.200

02:51.500 --> 02:53.400
I mean, don't you think he needs it?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.700
I know you like someone sitting by your side
when you read the box scores,

02:56.700 --> 02:59.600
-but I mean, dad
-no, no, that's fine.It'S...

02:59.600 --> 03:03.000
I'm just wondering who's the ttle, who's the pot?

03:03.400 --> 03:04.500
What do you mean?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.400
Well, ever since hannah put the lid on things,

03:07.400 --> 03:10.300
you've been moping around here like the dog ate your shoes.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.700
You need to go out,find a girl.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.800
That is the last thing I need.
I need a vacation from girls.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.400
A girl vacation.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.800
Do you know what a girl vacation is, dad?

03:20.800 --> 03:21.600
Prison?

03:21.600 --> 03:26.100
No. It's spending some time with me.Just me.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.200
I need to spend some quality time with me.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
Well, suit yourself.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.900
I'm sure you'll find e company boring.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.100
Adjective.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.600
Adulterous.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.900
We agreed.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.100
No wallowing.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
Adjective.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.700
is "heart-stomper"an adjective?

03:48.700 --> 03:49.700
Phil?

03:50.200 --> 03:51.300
Simian.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.900
-nice one.
-Really?

03:55.000 --> 03:55.900
Hey, guys.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.700
-Hey, eddie!
-Eddie!

03:57.700 --> 04:00.000
Let's see. Phone bill.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.600
No.Cool sports mag for me.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.800
Highly pretentious news mag for you.

04:05.800 --> 04:11.400
And finally...special delivery from... bakersfield.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.100
Oh! Yeah!

04:16.300 --> 04:17.300
That's the last one,right?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.100
Yes. The coil.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.800
It's been a long time,hasn't it?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.500
But klauss has been patient.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.900
Who's klauss?

04:23.900 --> 04:25.700
You haven't told her about klauss?

04:25.700 --> 04:26.400
Not yet.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.500
Who's klauss?

04:29.500 --> 04:33.000
Uh, only our, uh,non-rent-paying roommate who lives in the garage.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.800
Why haven't I met klauss yet?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.300
I'm sorry.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.500
I was waiting until I finished before I showed you.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.100
show the girl.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.600
Show the girl.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.400
Show the girl.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.200
lady and gentlemen,I present...klauss.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.600
Wow

05:05.700 --> 05:07.800
I've only recently rediscovered root beer.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
After a long period of ginger ale and various other colas...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.400
hmm. We're not allowed soft drinks.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.900
Well, sam isn't really, either.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.400
Only on special occasions.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.300
Yeah, like dinner.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.400
uh-oh.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.600
???

05:32.500 --> 05:34.300
I'll take my boys now,if you don't mD.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.000
I thought I was dropping them off after dinner.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.600
You were, until I got a call from my son to tell me
the boys were getting tattoos.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.500
Tattoos?

05:40.500 --> 05:43.800
Yes,jasper's is a red octopus.
I believe his brother got the grim reaper?

05:43.800 --> 05:44.400
What?

05:44.800 --> 05:46.900
No, christine, the boys were not getting tattooed.

05:46.900 --> 05:47.900
They weren't?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.900
Jasper must've called dr. Cataldo while I was getting mine.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.900
Yours?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.700
It's a D.N.A. Strand.Double helix.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.000
Hippy bob says he's never really inked one before.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.600
He really nailed the "t"residues, don't you think?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.400
You left the children with someone named "hippie bob"?

06:05.400 --> 06:07.500
No, hippy bob is an old friend.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.300
My sitter fell off a stepladder.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.100
Just because you are suddenly engaged to their father

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
doesn't mean you get to make
parenting decisions as to who watchethem.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.400
Hippy bob said they'd be temporary--wash right off.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.600
Boys? Put on your coats.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.200
Look, christine, I'm sorry.
I had to get my recertification,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.100
and things just got a little crazy.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.100
I guess our boys wi just have to feel
extra cool for a while, right?

06:26.300 --> 06:27.700
No, not right.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.200
You see, I prefer my children to
consider tattoos an accessory reserved

06:31.200 --> 06:34.800
for decorating convicts or blue-collar ideals of rebellion.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.400
Okay, I think you're overreacting.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.800
And I think it's amazing that despite the rigors of my job,

06:38.800 --> 06:40.900
I always managed to find adequate child care,

06:40.900 --> 06:44.000
whereas, you, who pick up dog poo for a living, cannot.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.800
Tattoos, hannah?

06:47.100 --> 06:48.800
-Tattoos.
-Christine,

06:48.800 --> 06:50.700
they're temporary.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.500
Jasper. Casper...

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
-say thank you and good-bye.
-Thank you.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.700
-Bye, sam.
-By the way,please tell my ex-husband

06:57.700 --> 06:59.200
I would've appreciated a phone call.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.300
It was lovely hearing about
your engagement from red the butcher.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.000
I think we're gonna need more root beer.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.200
now do you see?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.900
This is what I'm talking about.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.900
We got a target-rich environment--

07:38.100 --> 07:40.700
prime staging for a shock and awe campaign.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.800
Yeah, I'm bored already.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.900
I love it! Two garretts for the price of one.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.000
Aubrey.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.600
Fellas,this is taylor.

07:49.800 --> 07:53.600
Or as I like to call her,my only
conduit to sanity in russian lit.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.800
Nice to meet you.

07:55.000 --> 07:55.600
Nick.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.300
This is my brother ronnie.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.200
Hi, ronnie.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
It's good to meet you.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
Hi.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.400
What's wrong with him?

08:06.400 --> 08:08.800
Uh, he's just, uh, just feeling a little guilty

08:08.800 --> 08:10.900
that while he's here trying to enjoy himself,

08:10.900 --> 08:15.400
planet earth is being invaded by space aliens
with orangutan bodies and praying mantis heads?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.900
Is that it?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.400
Shall we cocktail?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
Let'S.

08:26.700 --> 08:32.700
I still love you

08:36.799 --> 08:41.000
doou really need to add a yard
sale to your plate?In january, no less?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.400
Don't think of it as a yard sale.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.900
Consider it... a cleansing.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.100
A purge.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.500
As in, to vomit forth?

08:47.500 --> 08:51.300
Exactly. I am vomiting forth the marginalia,

08:51.300 --> 08:54.000
the clutter that this house has accumulated over the years,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
to make things more comfortable for ray.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.300
What?

09:00.300 --> 09:03.100
I think I know why you have the sudden passion to purge.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.600
A yard sale is not such a radical notion, janet.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.200
These are things that pple do.

09:07.200 --> 09:12.100
Uh, things that people do when intimidated by the aura of their fianc?s ex.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.800
Christine walked out on him, by the way.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.500
So she is on your mind.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.300
Hey, ladies,

09:17.500 --> 09:20.600
what about these two hockey sticks with words on 'em?

09:20.700 --> 09:21.800
Those we keep.

09:24.700 --> 09:25.700
Ah.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.200
You passed the test.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.400
Yes.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.700
Well, congrats.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.900
Thank you.For another two years,
ethe unmentionables of schnauzers everywhere

09:32.900 --> 09:35.500
will continue to be clean and dry.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.600
I told you you could stop working.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.300
No. I want to.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.700
All I said was that I'd prefer if you stayed home.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.100
Just while sam's still young.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.400
Be here when he gets home from school.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.800
I mean, what's the point in making money, janet,

09:47.800 --> 09:50.600
if you can't allow your wife and her 
son to spend some time with each other?

09:51.100 --> 09:52.900
I don't know... ray.

09:52.900 --> 09:56.900
But when I mention this,
I'm suddenly being sexist,

09:56.900 --> 09:58.600
old-fashioned and a thug.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.600
Sexist and old-fashioned,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
yes,but you have been a thug long before this mention.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.200
Mm.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.600
You didn't tell ray about the tavern tattoo tirade?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.100
I can handle christine on my own.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.400
I don't need ray to get involved.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.200
-She's vicious, hannah.
-I know.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
She's also so together.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.400
She's a hand surgeon.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.500
I bet ray didn't mention to her that she could not work.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.300
And I'll go double or nothin'

10:31.500 --> 10:33.800
she doesn't have a bottle opener attached to her key ring.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.000
Then she's a fool.The joke will be on her

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
if she's ever stranded on a desert island

10:38.000 --> 10:41.600
with three cases of grape soda that don't have twist-offs.Ha!

10:41.600 --> 10:43.300
Hmm.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.100
Well, there is that other thing about her.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.200
Which is?

10:46.200 --> 10:48.500
She is someone ray once chose to marry.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.900
do these ac/dc knockoff bands
drive you as nuts as they drive me?

11:01.200 --> 11:03.400
What do you know from ac/dc?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.700
Oh, I know ac/dc.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.100
Can you even name seven ac/dc songs?

11:08.100 --> 11:09.300
Only seven?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.400
"Hells bells,""whole lotta rosie,"

11:11.400 --> 11:13.000
"for those about to rock,""heatseeker,"

11:13.000 --> 11:14.300
"highway to hell,""dirty deeds"

11:14.300 --> 11:17.700
and... "who made who."

11:18.200 --> 11:19.000
Wow.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.000
What?

11:20.500 --> 11:23.700
You didn't even need"you shook me all night long."

11:24.300 --> 11:25.700
hey, ronnie?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.300
Taylor's a big skier.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.700
Why don't you tell her about the time
that I dared you to roof ski.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.500
No, I got a bellyache.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.200
I don't wanna--

11:33.200 --> 11:34.400
what did you have for dinner?

11:34.600 --> 11:35.700
french fries.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.100
That's it?Just french fries?

11:37.100 --> 11:39.000
No, well,they were steak fries,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.200
and there was an abundant
quantity of soft potato meat.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
Okay, ronnie, hey,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.000
why don't you and taylor go hit up the jukebox?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Come on.It'll be an adventure.

11:48.100 --> 11:48.600
Go.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.700
This might be a thing.
He is so taylor's type.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.400
Well, then we should get those two together.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.500
Oh, and since when did you become matchmaker?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.600
I'm just trying to be a big brother, that's all.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.200
The guy's like a heap of unformed
clay when it comes to the ladies.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.900
My friends aren't here just as pick-me-ups, nick.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.700
No. No, no, no.Of course not.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.400
But I'm sensing chemistry.

12:11.000 --> 12:11.900
Aren't you?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.800
thomas edison drove a studebaker--

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
joe louis, ed sullivan and roger ebert,to name a few.

12:22.000 --> 12:22.800
Impressive.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.100
But what really clinched it?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.900
This is the car that kermit the frog and
fozzie bear drove to california in "the muppet movie."

12:30.600 --> 12:35.600
But a guy who doesn't leave the house restoring
a car he doesn't plan on driving?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.900
Isn't that a little...counterintuitive?

12:38.900 --> 12:41.700
I guess I just like the idea of taking something beautiful

12:41.700 --> 12:44.700
and broken and making it work the way it used to.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.700
And now klauss will be ready to go!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.200
Yes.We're gonna take klauss for a ride.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.300
Someday.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.200
Around the block.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.500
Not today.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.600
Someday.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.200
I still don't understand
what you're so worried about.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.600
I mean,we'll be inside the car,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.500
and inside when you're outside
is still inside, right?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.200
Wrong.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.100
Outside when you're inside is still outside.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.100
Okay, here we go.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.900
You ready?

13:28.400 --> 13:29.600
try it again.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.200
oh, no.We failed.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.900
We failed klauss.

13:43.100 --> 13:43.800
No.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.300
No, no, no, no,

13:46.300 --> 13:47.700
no, no, no, no, no.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.800
We haven't failed anything.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.800
We are gonna get klauss started,

13:51.900 --> 13:54.700
and then we're gonna go or a drive.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.700
Stay focused, ronnie.
You got nine cans of chili on the line.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.200
-ooh!
-oh, ho, ho.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.900
I like this.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.400
Our new world order--chums who can hang.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.600
I agree. This is nice.Psychosexual
politics have left the building.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.400
And I agree to that.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.700
Who knows?Maybe we can make it a thing.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.100
What kind of a tng?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.200
Friending.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.100
Friending?

14:25.100 --> 14:27.000
Yeah, you know, being friends without all the...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.300
-entanglements
-Exactly.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.400
Our goal here

14:30.400 --> 14:32.300
is to get those two together

14:32.400 --> 14:34.700
and to keep the friending alive.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.300
Fine.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.200
If you say so.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.800
I need a refill.Are you guys good?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.600
-We're good.
-Yeah.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.900
Hey, I think she likes you.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.200
you got a problem,ronnie garrett.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.000
You're in love with your brother's girlfriend.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.200
First of all,she's not his girlfriend.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.000
And second,
I am not in love with her.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.800
See? Now, if you weren't,

15:18.800 --> 15:21.000
the "she's not his girlfriend"wouldn't be the first part.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.100
Ikey--and this ain't the first time I noticed it.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.500
Every time she burps,
you act like you heard the symphony.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.700
Oh...

15:30.100 --> 15:32.200
whatever you say, dude,but I'm here.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.800
When you need to flap your gums?

15:34.000 --> 15:38.700
'Cause there's one thing I know.Loving the
wrong gal only leads to drinking alone.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.300
Today's guest rer caer month is ms. Daniels, sam's mom.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.100
Thank you, mrs. Burns.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.900
So... how many of you have pets at home?

16:06.300 --> 16:07.000
Great.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.100
And, um, how many of you have taken
them to the veterinarian's office?

16:10.100 --> 16:10.800
Sorry, I'm late.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.500
I had a small joint reconstruction on an
arthritic hand,and there were complications.

16:15.000 --> 16:15.900
Hannah?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.000
Hi, christine.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.100
Dr. Cataldo, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.100
Your presentation is scheduled for this coming monday.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.400
Oh, don't tell me that.I'm so sorry.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.900
One of my assistants must've...

16:30.100 --> 16:31.900
well, this is embarrassing.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.800
Okay, I'm leaving.Pretend I was never here.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.400
Bye, sweethearts. Mwah!

16:36.400 --> 16:39.100
Uh, when did you say?Monday.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.100
Ugh. Worst possible time.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.200
I have surgeries scheduled all week next week.Three on monday.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.800
Oh, I see.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.500
Well, it's fine.We'll--we'll do it next year.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.000
Oh, wait. Maybe we can rearrange things.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.600
Uh, perhaps ms. Daniels might
find her schedule more flexible

16:54.600 --> 16:57.300
that the children may have the benefit of the both of you?

17:07.599 --> 17:09.700
Sure. I can--I can come back another day.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.099
Are you sure?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.099
The floor is yours.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.400
Hi, guys.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.300
I'm dr. Christine cataldo.Now...

17:20.099 --> 17:23.300
how many of you have ever seen... a scalpel?

17:24.099 --> 17:26.099
How many of you would like to see a scalpel?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.600
Wow. What do you think?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
ooh!

17:32.000 --> 17:33.900
Yeah, pretty cool, right?

17:33.900 --> 17:36.900
Now do you know what kind
of doctor uses a scalpel?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.900
Only surgeons,which are very special kinds of doctors,

17:39.900 --> 17:44.100
and I am a very special kind of surgeon.
I work on your hand.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.900
I can make a very strong case
for this being a keeper.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.200
Fourear-old halloween costumes are non-negotiable.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.500
They go in the "out" pile.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.900
This was right after I learned
there's no such thing as santa claus.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.200
Werewolves helped me get over it...

18:02.700 --> 18:05.600
until, of course,I found out
there's no such thing as werewolves.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.100
And what helped you get over that?

18:07.100 --> 18:07.900
Dragons.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.300
Sorry, dude.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.500
Very controversial.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Why do you think dr. Catdo interrupted your presentation?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.600
She made a mistake.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.100
She got the da mixed up.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
She's really busy. I could see how that could happen.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.000
She didn't make a mistake.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
St week when I was over at their house,

18:29.600 --> 18:32.100
I told her you were making your presentation today.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.100
You did?

18:33.100 --> 18:34.200
She knew.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.900
She did it on purpose, ma.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.100
Well, why would she do that?

18:38.800 --> 18:40.600
That's what I asked you.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.300
and it was somewhere between the 21st
and 22nd day of no phones ringing

18:56.300 --> 19:00.400
that the best friend windows'brain trust considered the virtues of advertising.

19:01.200 --> 19:01.900
Hello.

19:01.900 --> 19:02.500
Hey.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.800
Hey, aubrey. What goes on?

19:04.800 --> 19:08.100
You called me.The message was,
"come to the office.I have a plan."

19:08.100 --> 19:10.500
I came right over.Love plans.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
Taylor and ronnie.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.000
Especially ones that involve my girlfriend and your nervous brother.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.400
He's new at this.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.400
So what do you say?Ll you call taylor?

19:19.700 --> 19:20.700
To what end?

19:20.700 --> 19:22.100
Because ronnie won'T.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.800
We'll all go out again.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.300
Like a double date?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.400
Like we'll all go out again.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.500
Okay.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.100
Well, we should go bowling.
Taylor likes to bowl.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.900
She likes to bowl?Really?

19:33.900 --> 19:36.700
Wow.Maybe she's more for my
father than she is for my brother.

19:36.700 --> 19:40.100
Does she also make her own barbecue
sauce using vodka and salt water taffy?

19:40.100 --> 19:43.300
Because if so, then she's definitely for my dad.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.100
I'll set it up...

19:45.100 --> 19:46.500
in the spirit of friending.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.400
Thank you.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.100
This is gonna be great.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.300
Let me just, uh,go on record here.

19:56.300 --> 19:57.700
If it were me,

19:57.900 --> 19:59.200
and i were trying to get over hannah--

19:59.200 --> 20:01.700
aubrey is not rebound material, okay?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.200
She's better than that.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.100
And I'm not in the market
for a girlfriend right now.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.800
Fair enough.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.800
You just better hope that
when you're ready to sta shoppin',

20:10.200 --> 20:11.900
she's still on the shelf.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.300
So what's on your mind,hannah?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.000
You knew it was my day.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.600
I knew it was your day?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.700
At the school.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.200
Oh, yes. I did.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.700
Yet you barged in there pretending
like you made some mistake,

20:42.700 --> 20:44.500
and I just want to know why.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.600
What is it?

20:46.600 --> 20:49.800
Dr. Papetti wanted to know if you looked
at mr. Steeves,the kienbock's patient?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.000
I did.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.300
Tell him it's a severely collapsed lunate,

20:54.300 --> 20:56.400
and I don't see how revascularization is an option.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.800
Ray says you once wanted to be a doctor.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.700
I did.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.500
What field?

21:04.800 --> 21:06.800
I was thinking about family medicine.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.400
Well, it's ironic,I guess, isn't it?

21:11.200 --> 21:12.300
What's that?

21:12.800 --> 21:16.400
Just how getting pregnant prevented
you from practicing family medicine.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.500
And now you work for a vet.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.200
Do you like it?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.400
I do.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.000
Well, it sounds dreamy to me.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.400
I mean, don't get me wrong.I love what I do,

21:26.210 --> 21:29.440
but, well, people have the ability to speak

21:29.440 --> 21:32.320
and complain and call you up at 4:00 in the morning

21:32.320 --> 21:33.580
because they can't make a fist.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.450
I trust basset hounds don't do that.

21:36.070 --> 21:39.110
Nope. Basset hounds only call during office hours.

21:39.110 --> 21:41.540
Dr. Cataldo, your 5:00 wrist fusion is prepped.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.620
I've got to go, hannah.
You didn't answer my question--

21:46.100 --> 21:48.080
why you showed up on my day.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.300
You've come along to take my place, hannah.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.500
Every now and again, just feels good to take yours.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.580
But you left him.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.210
I did, which doesn't mean four years later

21:57.210 --> 21:59.010
that I don't want him back.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.400
Come on, come on, come on.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.900
three gutter balls in a row!
We win again.

22:25.350 --> 22:26.640
(Laughs) let's get a beer.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.280
I think my business is done here.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.870
Aubrey,being lousy at bowling isn't necessarily a bad thing.

22:35.110 --> 22:36.680
you know,I think it's working.

22:36.970 --> 22:38.500
Things are... crackling.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.860
Well,she definitely likes him.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.380
You think he likes her?
He'd better.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.570
It's your arm swing.It's not loose.

22:47.570 --> 22:48.860
My arm swing?

22:50.550 --> 22:51.570
Well, will you show me?

22:51.640 --> 22:52.920
Yeah. Yeah.

22:54.470 --> 22:56.020
Um, grab the ball.
Okay.

22:56.910 --> 22:58.900
The best way to have a loose arm swing

22:58.900 --> 23:02.740
is to have your thumb relaxed,so put it in--in there.
okay

23:03.820 --> 23:05.660
Oh, thanks.
uh-huh

23:06.700 --> 23:09.810
so ronnie's been terrorizing the local lanes since we were kids.

23:09.810 --> 23:13.220
Oh, I'm not surprised.He is so fine.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.980
Now?
Yeah. Keep it loose.

23:22.710 --> 23:25.020
yes!-oh-yes

23:27.700 --> 23:30.020
you're a good teacher,ronnie.
thanks

23:32.150 --> 23:33.720
did you see that?
What happened?

23:34.090 --> 23:35.160
(Aubrey) I have never...

23:36.900 --> 23:39.580
it's good times, ronnie.She's a great girl.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.650
Yeah, she really is.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.630
she really, really is a great girl.

23:49.550 --> 23:51.710
(Janet) a vocational test?
i don't know

23:51.710 --> 23:54.490
I always blame getting pregnant for not going to med school.

23:55.230 --> 23:56.280
Maybe that's just a cop-out.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.840
Maybe I was just scared I wouldn't be able to cut it,

23:59.190 --> 24:01.510
so I used sam as a crutch to not even try.

24:02.030 --> 24:03.180
That's crazy talk.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.750
MaybI should accept ray's offer...

24:05.220 --> 24:08.140
not to stop working, but to stop working at the vet'S.

24:08.970 --> 24:10.350
Pursue something else.

24:10.630 --> 24:11.270
You ready, mom?

24:11.270 --> 24:13.520
Hence, a vocational test.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.050
I'm ready.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.280
Let's see if there's more to life than obtaining

24:18.280 --> 24:20.440
the health histories of calico cats.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.810
First question--

24:23.250 --> 24:26.160
"what is the highest education level you have ever received?"

24:26.200 --> 24:27.240
High school.

24:29.410 --> 24:32.720
"In the next 12 months,your career goal is to..."

24:32.720 --> 24:34.070
figure out a career goal?

24:35.430 --> 24:37.750
"Would you describe yourself as a team player?"

24:37.750 --> 24:40.320
If that team is the red sox, yeah.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.840
I'll put down "no."

24:42.550 --> 24:45.740
"Have you ever milked a cow?"
Really?

24:45.740 --> 24:47.600
It starts to get a little nutty.

24:47.800 --> 24:51.200
Um, yeah, once,at my uncle jim's farm.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.040
"Have you ever played billiards wearing an evening dress?"

24:58.650 --> 25:00.780
You know, she's right, phil.You should take her for a spin.

25:01.540 --> 25:02.880
I just continue to be amazed

25:02.880 --> 25:05.330
by which part of "shut-in"is unclear to you guys.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.460
Is it the "shut"?Or perhaps it's the "in."

25:09.200 --> 25:12.060
Nice!Ooh. Whoo.
You like? Yeah.

25:12.060 --> 25:13.920
So how'd the double date go?

25:13.920 --> 25:18.220
Yeah, how? Was the nick-aubrey sexual tension so ick,

25:18.220 --> 25:20.500
it made bowlers three lanes down blush?

25:20.500 --> 25:22.220
There was definitely some sexual tension,

25:22.220 --> 25:24.230
but not of the nick-aubrey variety.

25:24.230 --> 25:27.060
Really? Baby bro bowl a strike?

25:27.060 --> 25:30.090
Not yet, but taylor invited him to her house tomorrow night,

25:30.090 --> 25:32.240
so it's pretty much on.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.180
Maybe. You know,you never know.

25:34.180 --> 25:36.470
I think ronnie's just a little nervous.

25:36.470 --> 25:37.600
It's been a while.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.850
All right.How long's "a while"?

25:39.500 --> 25:43.450
Last girl that touched me was gina disimone.

25:43.450 --> 25:44.970
Uh,haircuts don't count.

25:44.970 --> 25:50.220
Well, then it's been a year.
A year? Poor guy.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.960
Do I detect a little performance anxiety in our randy young charge?

25:53.960 --> 25:57.600
No. I'm--I'm fine.I am f--I'm fine.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.520
try and start it now, phil.

26:01.660 --> 26:02.530
Uh...yeah.

26:04.430 --> 26:07.770
I, uh... I didn't know that you were down there.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.050
it's alive!
Nice!

26:13.880 --> 26:17.650
oh, um, when in doubt,rub her earlobes.

26:17.650 --> 26:19.140
What do--what do you mean?

26:19.140 --> 26:21.400
Like you were opening combination cks.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.630
Um, I'm not gonna--
trust me. Earlobes.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.550
Combination locks.

26:30.700 --> 26:33.000
Hey, guys, guys,it's coming up.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.580
Well, how'd I do?

26:38.050 --> 26:38.800
What's it say?

26:38.800 --> 26:40.630
I thought u loved animals.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.030
I don't understand.What does that mean?

26:47.870 --> 26:50.320
It means, based on your answers and interests,

26:50.320 --> 26:54.620
the occupation you're most suited for is...

26:55.870 --> 26:58.180
a prizefighter?
What?

26:59.150 --> 27:01.030
Like a boxer? (Chuckles)

27:01.520 --> 27:07.560
yeah. You know,brawler, palooka...pugilist.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.280
That's ridiculous, sam.There must be some mistake.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.400
Sorry, ma.There's no mistake.

27:19.670 --> 27:22.700
Come on! Give it!Jasper, it's mine!

27:27.960 --> 27:29.570
Muppet baby head for your thoughts?

27:30.300 --> 27:32.940
I was advised to pursue a career in prizefighng, janet.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.570
It's only some lousy test, babe.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.040
Maybe I am a product of poor breeding.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.040
Hey, stop.Your breeding is fine.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.280
No, christine's is fine.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.180
Mine is off the rack.

27:43.430 --> 27:44.460
Give you a dollar for this.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.900
No negotiating, matty.Everything is priced to move.

27:52.510 --> 27:54.870
Connor, of course you have to be nice to your sister

27:54.870 --> 27:57.800
when I'm not home,especially 'men i not.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.600
I love you, too, okay?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.150
I'll see you guys on friday.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.480
By baby.

28:07.430 --> 28:08.020
you okay?

28:08.430 --> 28:12.380
It's just tough not tucking 'em in every night, you know?

28:12.380 --> 28:13.110
I bet.

28:16.110 --> 28:18.600
sundays were always rowan family game night.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.220
What do you say we all play ourselves a board game later tonight?

28:22.220 --> 28:23.830
Oh, he's got to be kidding.

28:24.620 --> 28:28.240
How about an old-school game of 4-man risk?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.540
A mellow night of global domination.

28:31.050 --> 28:33.400
Sorry, owen. I... can'T.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.820
That girl, taylor-- she invited me to her place.

28:36.820 --> 28:37.800
Aubrey's friend?

28:38.240 --> 28:41.670
One real date and back to her place?Not bad, ronald.

28:41.670 --> 28:45.670
That's right, owen.He's got the garrett man smoldering brood.

28:45.670 --> 28:47.020
Drives the women crazy.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.200
So ronnie's going to aubrey's friend's house,

28:49.200 --> 28:51.410
but you're staying home to conquer the world with us?

28:51.410 --> 28:53.410
That's an unexpected turn of events.

28:53.410 --> 28:54.920
Yeah, he's on girl vacation.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.080
Girl vacation?

28:56.080 --> 29:00.600
Yeah, he and the, uh,schneid together,spending some time alone.

29:10.470 --> 29:13.550
oh, I'm sorry. That's broken.I meant to pull that from the box.

29:13.550 --> 29:17.000
I thought this place looked familiar.You're onions and eggplant,right?

29:18.450 --> 29:20.430
Ridge pizza. We deliver.

29:21.320 --> 29:25.400
Oh, right.Actually, onions and eggplant is right over there.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.850
It's my son.I'm just plain old cheese,so I do a lot of picking off.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.700
Hey, it's going well, huh?

29:32.700 --> 29:36.660
Oh. Onions and eggplant is romantilly linked sausage and pepper.

29:38.100 --> 29:38.970
I had no idea.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.440
Oh, man.What is she doing here?

29:46.500 --> 29:47.420
Hello, sam.

29:48.350 --> 29:51.110
Casper, jasper, wrap it up.Inside!

29:51.110 --> 29:52.140
Get your things now.

29:52.140 --> 29:53.460
This is just like her.

29:53.550 --> 29:55.130
We agreed the boys could stay all day.

29:55.130 --> 29:58.710
Ray, let me handle this.
Have at it.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.110
Hello, hannah.
hello

30:03.520 --> 30:06.350
Listen, I know that it hasn't been pretty between us lately,

30:06.350 --> 30:11.400
but we need to get along or at least be civil for the sake of the boys.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.060
Hannah,I couldn't agree more.

30:13.800 --> 30:17.520
I may be a doctor,but I'm also a mother and a pragmatist,

30:17.520 --> 30:20.600
and you're right.You're right.We can do better.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.610
Thanks, christine.

30:24.180 --> 30:26.110
Yeah. Honestly, hannah, I had you pegged all wrong.

30:26.870 --> 30:27.600
What do you mean?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.100
We, I thought for certain there'd be a keg.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.320
And what time does the snot-drunk game of horseshoes break out?

30:33.320 --> 30:36.800
And where's the deep fryer?Are we gonna bubble up some ham hocks?

30:37.170 --> 30:38.710
Okay, christine, I get it.

30:38.710 --> 30:40.650
Why don't you just take the twins and go?

30:40.650 --> 30:44.120
You know, but this much I will concede. Your son--

30:45.100 --> 30:47.610
he seems like a very clever boy.

30:47.610 --> 30:50.880
Darling sense of humor.He's a lovely child.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.020
Thank you.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.840
Especially for a bastard.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.460
What did you say?
Oh, you heard me.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.750
That's my ma,the prizefighter.

31:09.210 --> 31:12.780
You know, I have high hopes for tonight.I really do.

31:12.780 --> 31:14.470
Taylor and ronnie?

31:14.470 --> 31:17.200
Or, as I like to refer to it,ronnie and taylor.

31:17.930 --> 31:19.700
Baby brother gets top billing.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.930
It's in his contract.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.860
Got any fancy plans this evening, teach?

31:26.550 --> 31:30.850
I do, indeed.Uh, I'm actually playing risk tonight

31:30.850 --> 31:33.000
with the commander and owen.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.700
Oh, i love that game.

31:35.550 --> 31:36.840
You're more than welcome to join.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.490
Really?

31:40.280 --> 31:43.320
Darts in the afternoon, board games at night--

31:43.400 --> 31:46.130
really taking this friending thing seriously.

31:46.760 --> 31:49.500
I like it.So what do you say?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.000
Games with the garrett gang?

31:52.510 --> 31:53.320
I can'T.

31:54.050 --> 31:55.980
Wouldn't be fair.
Why not?

31:56.570 --> 31:58.770
The thing about risk is that you can't win

31:58.770 --> 32:00.370
unless you're willing to be vulnerable,

32:00.370 --> 32:02.360
put yourself at risk,as it were.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.870
And at that moment,

32:03.870 --> 32:06.400
the board game chat had taken on a whole new meaning.

32:06.940 --> 32:09.030
The whole arrangement looks great on paper,

32:09.030 --> 32:10.080
especially for you,

32:10.970 --> 32:15.580
you, who gets to have his cake and throw darts with it on lazy afternoons, too.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.610
But really, consider it.

32:18.230 --> 32:21.430
You pursued me last fall like I was the last train out of hell,

32:21.430 --> 32:23.750
only to run to hannah when we started to get some footing.

32:23.750 --> 32:26.070
Oh, and, hey, I get it--

32:26.070 --> 32:28.230
lost love and all, back to the egg.

32:29.050 --> 32:32.950
But take five seconds to look at it from the rooftop where I'm perched.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.670
I really liked you.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.900
And at the very moment wh I decided

32:38.900 --> 32:41.800
not to be afraid to come and bite the apple,

32:41.800 --> 32:45.620
well, you decided all you really wanted was a chunk of your past.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.280
And now you come to me,like a beer buddy,

32:48.280 --> 32:50.180
and ask me to forget those few weeks when,

32:50.180 --> 32:52.830
for the first time in a while,

32:53.370 --> 32:55.750
I had felt like I was on to something true.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.740
Aubrey, I--
so no.

33:00.370 --> 33:03.130
No, I don't think that I can play risk with you tonight,

33:03.850 --> 33:07.180
because none of this, none of this at all,

33:07.180 --> 33:10.410
bodes well for my survival on the battlefield.Bull's-eye.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.200
???
I think so, too.

33:20.370 --> 33:21.640
bye, nick.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.350
are we in the mood for bogart and bacall tonight?

33:41.710 --> 33:43.730
Or hepburn and tracy? 
Neither.

33:44.700 --> 33:47.130
Not godzilla and mothra?Not again.

33:47.580 --> 33:50.870
Nope. I think I have a better idea.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.800
What's that?

33:52.970 --> 33:56.430
We're gonna take klauss for a ride.
No way.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.680
Come on.Just once around the block.

34:00.680 --> 34:03.210
Once? Do you know what once leads to?

34:03.210 --> 34:05.240
What?
Twice.

34:06.100 --> 34:10.500
Just the two of us.It'll be like a mini romantic getaway.

34:11.199 --> 34:16.020
Come on.You and me in the car together...

34:16.020 --> 34:18.400
alone under the dome light.

34:22.929 --> 34:25.280
some people still have their christmas decorations up.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.650
I mean, don't you want to get to see that?

34:32.600 --> 34:33.880
What about the mannings?

34:34.520 --> 34:35.800
Are theirs sti up?

34:35.800 --> 34:37.110
The big white house on the corner?

34:37.969 --> 34:41.020
Oh. Oh, they're still up, all right--

34:41.900 --> 34:43.130
three wiseen and all.

34:44.050 --> 34:45.500
I love the mannings' wise men.

34:46.590 --> 34:49.679
They bear an uncan resemblance to moe, larry and curly.

34:56.630 --> 34:59.230
You need anything else,baby?
No, thanks.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.080
Okay.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.860
U were married to a surgeon...

35:05.370 --> 35:06.750
a beautiful surgeon,

35:06.750 --> 35:09.000
and she may want you back.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.850
The only good thing in five years of marriage,

35:11.900 --> 35:13.350
aside from the twins,

35:13.900 --> 35:16.660
that christine ever did for me was up and leave,

35:17.440 --> 35:20.580
because if she didn't, well, then,I wouldn't have been available

35:20.580 --> 35:24.240
when the most amazing woman in the world came walking down the street.

35:25.850 --> 35:28.630
And then that woman turned a corner, and you saw me.

35:28.630 --> 35:29.820
Exactly.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.240
not funny, sam.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.370
How you doing, champ?
My knuckles are killing me.

35:45.330 --> 35:47.600
I know a good hand surgeon.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.930
ha And with that, southern europe is mine.

35:54.930 --> 35:57.400
Sorry, nick.
Fabulous.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.050
Oh, no long faces, son.It's the same in love and war.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.800
So you got driven out of france.

36:02.800 --> 36:05.840
The best way to overcome that is invade belgium.And belgian beer--

36:05.840 --> 36:09.600
oh. Now there's a source of a long and glorious love affair.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.670
I left my home in monterey

36:12.670 --> 36:15.510
just another low prospects man

36:16.640 --> 36:22.280
I'd rather work in the foundry than put fishes in a can

36:23.730 --> 36:28.150
I'm 35 and I haven't traveled far

36:30.380 --> 36:35.370
and I've spent all my money on this misbegotten car

36:38.130 --> 36:39.410
I'm up against...

36:39.410 --> 36:42.200
you know what?I can't do this.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.860
Are you serious?

36:44.600 --> 36:47.180
I have to go see someone.I'm sorry.

36:47.570 --> 36:50.720
Keeps on breaking down again

36:52.130 --> 36:57.770
my studebaker keeps on breaking down again

36:59.660 --> 37:05.080
I thought I'd go to fresno  just to see my friend

37:06.360 --> 37:15.520
but my damn studebaker  keeps on breaking down again

37:17.680 --> 37:19.000
we can't do this.

37:19.800 --> 37:20.600
What?

37:21.500 --> 37:22.860
I don't want to be your friend.

37:23.650 --> 37:26.100
We need to talk. 
Wrong verb, teach.

37:31.110 --> 37:35.180
I'm 35 and I haven't traveled far

37:37.820 --> 37:42.440
and I've spent all my money on this misbegotten car

37:45.500 --> 37:51.400
I'm up against it all like a leaf against the wind

37:51.850 --> 37:57.910
and the studebaker keeps on breaking down again

37:59.470 --> 38:04.970
my studebaker keeps on breaking down again

38:06.500 --> 38:12.270
I thought I'd go to fresno just to see my friend

38:13.560 --> 38:22.400
but my damn studebaker  keeps on  breaking down again

38:37.850 --> 38:44.150
I'm up against it all like a leaf against the wind

38:44.940 --> 38:50.670
and the studebaker keeps on breaking down again

38:51.930 --> 38:57.840
my studebaker keeps on breaking down again

38:59.770 --> 39:05.110
I thought I'd go to fresno just to see my friend

39:06.280 --> 39:15.460
but my damn studebaker keeps on breaking down again

39:23.850 --> 39:30.250
I was speeding south on 99  when the manifold started smoking

39:31.040 --> 39:37.580
I ran her off the shoulder and now the axle's broken

39:38.180 --> 39:42.770
it made a sound  that cracked my heart in half

40:21.800 --> 40:22.800
what are you thinking?

40:24.060 --> 40:27.520
That you just friended my brains out.

40:28.430 --> 40:34.350
I'm up against it all like a leaf against the wind

40:35.400 --> 40:41.100
and the studebaker keeps on breaking down again

40:41.100 --> 40:44.800
okay, you were right.I'm nu about her.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.300
So tell me,what do I have to do?

40:48.300 --> 40:50.750
What do I have to do to get her out of my head?

40:50.800 --> 40:55.240
I thought I'd go to fresno just to see my friend

40:56.220 --> 41:05.530
but this damn studebaker keeps on breaking down again

41:05.530 --> 41:18.190
