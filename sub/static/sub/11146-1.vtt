03:28.157 --> 03:29.658
Hi, Maile.

03:29.659 --> 03:30.659
Hi, Eddie.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.160
I thought maybe
you were mad at me.

03:32.161 --> 03:33.662
I haven't had to
chase you for a week.

03:33.663 --> 03:34.663
Now, Eddie...

03:34.664 --> 03:37.165
Sorry. You're not going
to talk me out of it.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.134
But I'm in a big hurry.
It is important.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.669
How many times
do I have to warn you?

03:40.670 --> 03:42.170
If you fly now,
you'll pay later.

03:42.171 --> 03:44.172
Please, no lectures.
I'm late.

03:44.173 --> 03:45.674
Chad's coming home.

03:45.675 --> 03:47.677
Chad?
Home from Europe?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.678
His plane's probably
landing at the airport

03:49.679 --> 03:50.680
right now.

03:51.180 --> 03:53.181
Follow me.
Let's don't keep the soldier waiting.

03:53.182 --> 03:54.683
Oh, thank you, Eddie.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.724
Thanks, Eddie! Bye!

04:41.731 --> 04:43.231
Hi, Wahilla.

04:43.232 --> 04:45.234
Hello, Maile. You got
passengers coming in?

04:45.735 --> 04:47.235
Just one. Chad's
out of the Army.

04:47.236 --> 04:49.237
Chad? Here,
with my compliments.

04:49.238 --> 04:50.238
Oh, <i>mahalo.</i>

04:50.239 --> 04:53.241
United Airlines flight
now arriving

04:53.242 --> 04:55.244
at United Airlines ramp.

05:17.266 --> 05:19.768
Oh, Wahilla,
I think I'm scared.

05:19.769 --> 05:22.270
He's been gone
for 2 years.

05:22.271 --> 05:23.772
What if he's changed?

05:23.773 --> 05:25.774
Just be patient
with him.

05:25.775 --> 05:27.275
Some boys need time

05:27.276 --> 05:29.778
to get adjusted
to being back home.

05:37.286 --> 05:39.788
Some of them get
the hang of it right away.

05:39.789 --> 05:41.289
Hi, Maile.

05:41.290 --> 05:42.791
Hi, Wahilla.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.293
Hi, Chad.

05:45.294 --> 05:47.796
It worked.
She's jealous.

05:47.797 --> 05:49.297
She should be.

05:49.298 --> 05:51.299
Please, come along.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.301
Get going, will you?
Move along.

05:53.302 --> 05:55.303
He's been in the
service overseas.

05:55.304 --> 05:56.805
For 2 years,
I was there.

05:56.806 --> 05:58.306
I was over 3 years,

05:58.307 --> 05:59.808
but all I got
when I came back

06:00.309 --> 06:01.309
was coffee and donuts.

06:01.310 --> 06:02.310
Excuse me, sir.

06:02.311 --> 06:03.311
Thanks again.

06:03.312 --> 06:04.313
Thank <i>you.</i>

06:05.815 --> 06:06.815
Maile.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.316
I'd welcome you home,

06:08.317 --> 06:09.818
but I'm not speaking
to you.

06:09.819 --> 06:10.820
Hey!

06:15.324 --> 06:16.825
I was only having
some fun.

06:16.826 --> 06:18.326
I saw you.

06:18.327 --> 06:20.328
You knew I'd be
waiting for you.

06:20.329 --> 06:22.330
How could you
kiss that girl?

06:22.331 --> 06:23.332
It was easy.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.335
I mean, you call
that a kiss?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.340
<i>That's</i> a kiss.

06:32.341 --> 06:35.343
My French blood tells me
to argue with you,

06:35.344 --> 06:38.346
and my Hawaiian blood
tells me not to,

06:38.347 --> 06:41.349
and they're really
battling it out inside of me.

06:41.350 --> 06:45.353
I've never seen a more
beautiful battleground.

06:45.354 --> 06:48.357
All right, soldier.
You win.

06:50.359 --> 06:51.359
Yeah.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.861
Welcome home.

06:56.866 --> 07:00.368
I wonder where he took
his basic training.

07:00.369 --> 07:01.870
In Hawaii.

07:09.879 --> 07:11.880
Sure you don't
want to drive?

07:11.881 --> 07:13.381
It's still your car,
you know.

07:13.382 --> 07:15.383
Uh-uh. No.
I'm fine right here.

07:15.384 --> 07:17.886
You sure kept them both
in good shape.

07:17.887 --> 07:18.887
Both?

07:18.888 --> 07:20.889
Mm-hmm. Your body
and my car's.

07:20.890 --> 07:21.890
<i>Pupule.</i>

07:21.891 --> 07:23.892
I'll show you
who's crazy. Hit it!

07:30.783 --> 07:32.401
Hey, what
are you doing?

07:32.568 --> 07:34.903
I'm not going home now.

07:34.904 --> 07:37.405
<i>Wikiwiki...</i>
To the beach.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.426
I missed you, Maile.

07:58.427 --> 07:59.928
I missed you, too.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.930
What were you doing
all that time

08:01.931 --> 08:03.431
while I was
missing you?

08:03.432 --> 08:05.433
Ahem.
Uh, being true to you.

08:05.434 --> 08:06.435
Always?

08:06.936 --> 08:07.936
Almost always.

08:07.937 --> 08:09.437

09:28.517 --> 09:30.519
Hi there!

09:42.531 --> 09:44.032
Well, what are
we waiting for?

09:44.533 --> 09:46.501
- Got your bathing suit?
- Uh-uh.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.036
Don't worry about it.
I brought you one from Paris.

09:48.037 --> 09:49.537
But I've got a job,
remember?

09:49.538 --> 09:51.539
Not today.
It's a Hawaiian holiday.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.041
Didn't your mother
ever tell you about hooky-hooky day?

09:53.042 --> 09:55.043
Hooky-hooky.

09:55.044 --> 09:57.046
Come on.

09:59.048 --> 10:00.048
The old shack.

10:00.049 --> 10:01.549
The boys really kept
it up, didn't they?

10:01.550 --> 10:04.052
I used to think a lot
about this place.

10:04.053 --> 10:06.055
I was afraid
it might change,

10:06.555 --> 10:07.556
but it's still
beautiful.

10:08.057 --> 10:09.058
Now, this is for me.

10:09.558 --> 10:10.558
You're not going
to stay here.

10:10.559 --> 10:12.060
Why not? I got
a roof over my head,

10:12.061 --> 10:13.062
a cot, and a stove...

10:13.562 --> 10:16.564
but you've got a beautiful house
in Kahala and a family.

10:16.565 --> 10:18.566
Look, let's get this
over with.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.068
All the time
I was overseas,

10:20.069 --> 10:22.570
I got a letter from
my folks every week

10:22.571 --> 10:24.572
reminding me
of my beautiful home

10:24.573 --> 10:26.074
and my beautiful future

10:26.075 --> 10:28.076
in my dad's beautiful
pineapple business.

10:28.077 --> 10:29.577
And the more
they reminded me,

10:29.578 --> 10:31.579
the more I knew
I couldn't come back

10:31.580 --> 10:33.581
with the rest of my life
all laid out for me.

10:33.582 --> 10:34.582
No, Maile.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.584
It's too easy to fall
into a ready-made setup.

10:36.585 --> 10:38.586
I got to do this
on my own. I got to do it myself.

10:38.587 --> 10:40.088
Can't you
tell them that?

10:40.089 --> 10:41.589
- I will!
- Good!

10:41.590 --> 10:43.091
When the time
is right.

10:43.092 --> 10:46.094
Please don't
take too much time.

10:46.095 --> 10:48.596
I don't know how long
I can wait for you to grow up.

10:48.597 --> 10:50.098
Oh, you're
a pretty fresh kid.

10:50.099 --> 10:53.101
I think I'll
let you have one.

10:53.102 --> 10:54.602
Why, you little...

10:54.603 --> 10:55.603
so on, so forth,
and so on!

10:55.604 --> 10:56.604
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:56.605 --> 10:58.606
No, Chad, no!

10:58.607 --> 11:00.609
No! Aah!

11:02.111 --> 11:03.112
Aah!

11:05.614 --> 11:06.615
Aah!

11:07.116 --> 11:08.117
Oh!

11:28.637 --> 11:31.139
Ha ha ha!

11:31.640 --> 11:32.641
Ha ha! Ohh...

11:33.142 --> 11:34.142
What's so funny?

11:34.143 --> 11:36.144
I bought this dress
to welcome you home.

11:36.145 --> 11:37.645
It's the first time
I've worn it.

11:37.646 --> 11:38.646
You want to know
something?

11:38.647 --> 11:40.649
On you, wet is
my favorite color.

11:48.157 --> 11:48.657
Hi.

11:49.158 --> 11:50.659
Hello there.
Where'd you come from?

11:51.160 --> 11:53.162
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

11:56.165 --> 11:58.167
Could I play
with you?

11:58.667 --> 12:00.168
I think you're
a little young for this game.

12:00.169 --> 12:03.171
If I get a girl,
can I play with you?

12:03.172 --> 12:05.173
He's not as young
as I thought.

12:05.174 --> 12:06.674
The game's over,
pal.

12:06.675 --> 12:08.176
Maybe some
other time, OK?

12:08.177 --> 12:09.178
Bye.

12:09.678 --> 12:10.178
Bye.

12:10.679 --> 12:12.180
What do you say
we go for a swim?

12:12.181 --> 12:13.182
Might as well.

12:13.682 --> 12:14.683
We can't dance.

12:18.187 --> 12:20.189
The suit's in this bag.

12:28.697 --> 12:30.198
- Ready?
- Almost.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.200
Did you really
buy this in Paris?

12:32.201 --> 12:34.202
The first 3-day pass
I had. How's it fit?

12:34.203 --> 12:36.205
You tell me.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.209
And, uh, wow.

12:41.210 --> 12:43.711
Don't you think the sleeves
are a little long?

12:43.712 --> 12:45.713
I used to dream of you
wearing a muumuu.

12:45.714 --> 12:47.715
Well, if my grandmother
ever saw me in this,

12:47.716 --> 12:50.218
she'd sew me up in
a muumuu... For life.

12:50.219 --> 12:51.719
Don't you like it?

12:51.720 --> 12:53.221
Oh, I love it.

12:53.222 --> 12:55.223
And I thank you
for thinking of me.

12:55.224 --> 12:56.724
Oh, I wasn't
thinking of you.

12:56.725 --> 12:58.693
I was thinking of me.

13:20.172 --> 13:21.172
Now can I play?

13:21.173 --> 13:22.673
Can he play?

13:22.674 --> 13:23.674
Ha ha ha!

13:23.675 --> 13:25.176
Sure, kids. Later.

13:29.181 --> 13:31.182
You said I can play.

13:31.183 --> 13:32.184
Later.

13:52.204 --> 13:56.207
Hey, it's Chad!
Maile!

13:56.208 --> 13:58.709
Hello, Chad! Maile!

13:58.710 --> 14:00.211

15:55.827 --> 15:56.828
Hey, Sarge,

15:57.329 --> 15:59.830
what happened
to all your medals?

15:59.831 --> 16:02.333
This is it.
This is all I got.

16:02.334 --> 16:03.834
Hey, look at Duke!

16:03.835 --> 16:05.336
Duke!

16:05.337 --> 16:06.837
Look at Duke.
He missed you, too!

16:06.838 --> 16:09.340
He looks great.
He looks great.

16:09.341 --> 16:10.841
But he's still
as stupid as ever.

16:10.842 --> 16:11.842
Ah, lay off!

16:11.843 --> 16:13.344
You know Duke's
sensitive.

16:13.345 --> 16:14.845
You'll hurt
his feelings.

16:14.846 --> 16:18.849
Ito, your chest slipped
from here to here!

16:18.850 --> 16:21.352
Hey, Paul,
you still slaphappy?

16:21.353 --> 16:22.353
Yeah!

16:22.354 --> 16:23.354
Slaphappy!

16:23.355 --> 16:24.355
- Hey!
- Ho!

16:24.356 --> 16:25.856

17:12.521 --> 17:14.405

to come in!

17:21.913 --> 17:22.913
Yeah!
Yeah.

17:22.914 --> 17:24.915

Hey, Maile,
come on in, will you?

19:22.033 --> 19:24.535
Not yet!

19:44.556 --> 19:46.558
Hey, dig this
crazy seaweed.

19:47.058 --> 19:48.059
That's no seaweed.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.120
That's the top
of Maile's bathing suit!

19:50.562 --> 19:53.064
H-h-hey, Maile,
just stay right there!

19:58.570 --> 20:00.070
Hey, Maile,
don't come out!

20:00.071 --> 20:01.572
Just stay there!

20:07.579 --> 20:10.081
Hey, he's bringing
a shirt out to her.

20:12.584 --> 20:14.084
See, ito,
I told you.

20:14.085 --> 20:15.586
That dog is just
plain stupid.

20:15.587 --> 20:17.087
Quiet!
He's sensitive.

20:17.088 --> 20:18.589
He can't hear me
way out there...

20:19.090 --> 20:20.091
Can he?

20:21.092 --> 20:22.593
It's all here...

20:22.594 --> 20:24.094
Exactly what time
your plane leaves

20:24.095 --> 20:25.096
and lands in Maui.

20:25.597 --> 20:26.877
Thank you very much,
young lady.

20:27.098 --> 20:27.598
Have a nice time.

20:28.099 --> 20:28.599
Thank you.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.601
Come back
and see us.

20:30.602 --> 20:31.603
Bye.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.105
Hello, Mr. Gates.

20:34.606 --> 20:36.106
Hello, Maile.

20:36.107 --> 20:37.608
I'll come right
to the point.

20:37.609 --> 20:38.609
Is my son here?

20:38.610 --> 20:40.110
Chad? Here?

20:40.111 --> 20:41.612
You know what I mean.

20:41.613 --> 20:43.113
I've heard he's been
home for several days.

20:43.114 --> 20:45.115
If this is true, I know
that you've seen him.

20:45.116 --> 20:47.618
Well?

20:47.619 --> 20:49.119
That's good enough
for me.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.121
Chad's mother doesn't
know about this,

20:51.122 --> 20:54.124
and I want him home
before she finds out.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.626
If he doesn't
consider my feelings,

20:55.627 --> 20:57.628
he does owe some
consideration to his mother.

20:57.629 --> 21:00.130
I leave it to you.

21:00.131 --> 21:01.131
Good-bye, Maile.

21:01.132 --> 21:02.633
Good-bye, Mr. Gates.

21:20.151 --> 21:21.151
Hi, O'Hara.

21:21.152 --> 21:22.152
Hi.

21:22.153 --> 21:23.654
Don't you dig judo?

21:23.655 --> 21:25.656
Man don't live
on muscles alone.

21:25.657 --> 21:27.658
You got any ketchup
in that bag?

21:27.659 --> 21:29.159
No, but I have
some lipstick.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.160
Same color.

21:30.161 --> 21:31.662
Nah. Lipstick,
like, fattening.

21:31.663 --> 21:33.664
<i>I'm</i> on a diet.

21:33.665 --> 21:35.165
Oh, yeah.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.667
Where's Chad?

21:36.668 --> 21:38.168
Back in the briny.

21:38.169 --> 21:40.120
It's just like
he never left.

21:40.121 --> 21:41.672
Even though
there's no surf,

21:41.673 --> 21:43.173
he's right back
in the swim.

21:43.174 --> 21:45.676
Well, he's about
to be beached.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.202
Well, it's about time
you got here.

22:12.203 --> 22:14.705
I sneaked away half an hour
early as it is.

22:14.706 --> 22:16.707
The fellas are playing
for a luau tonight at the outrigger.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.208
I told them
to count us in.

22:18.209 --> 22:20.711
Can't. The whole family's
meeting in Haleiwa tonight.

22:20.712 --> 22:22.212
At your grandmother's?

22:22.213 --> 22:24.214
It's her birthday.
She's 78.

22:24.215 --> 22:25.716
Well, that's something
to celebrate.

22:25.717 --> 22:27.217
Am I invited?

22:27.218 --> 22:28.719
You're hiding out,
remember?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.220
Not from <i>your</i> folks.

22:30.221 --> 22:31.221
Yours, either.

22:31.222 --> 22:32.222
Huh?

22:32.223 --> 22:34.725
Your father came
to see me today.

22:35.727 --> 22:38.729
He knows you're back.

22:38.730 --> 22:41.181
You've got to go
home sometime. Why?

22:41.182 --> 22:43.734
You can't spend
the rest of your life on a surfboard.

22:43.735 --> 22:45.235
Oh, yes, I can.

22:45.236 --> 22:47.237
The G.I. bill
of rights

22:47.238 --> 22:49.239
says I get
my old job back.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.741
This is my old job.

22:50.742 --> 22:54.244
Like I said,
yankee, go home!

22:54.245 --> 22:55.746
Hey, wait a...

22:55.747 --> 22:57.247
Hey, wait!

22:57.248 --> 22:59.250
I'll get you!

23:00.251 --> 23:02.753
It's certainly nice
to have you here.

23:02.754 --> 23:03.754
Thank you, Fred.

23:03.755 --> 23:05.255
Oh, here we are.

23:05.256 --> 23:08.258
Daddy, let's drink
a toast to your boss.

23:08.259 --> 23:09.259
Aloha, Jack.

23:09.260 --> 23:10.260
Aloha.

23:10.261 --> 23:11.261
Aloha, daddy.

23:11.262 --> 23:12.263
Aloha.

23:13.765 --> 23:16.266
You know,
every time I come here,

23:16.267 --> 23:17.768
I feel like
a prize fool.

23:17.769 --> 23:19.770
I've seen the latest
company statement

23:19.771 --> 23:21.271
raising
the dividends.

23:21.272 --> 23:22.272
You're no fool,
boss.

23:22.273 --> 23:24.775
Oh, no? Then how come
I moved you here

23:24.776 --> 23:26.777
and kept myself
on the mainland?

23:26.778 --> 23:28.779
To your glorious
Hawaiian winters.

23:28.780 --> 23:29.780
Aloha, Jack.

23:29.781 --> 23:31.281
Aloha.

23:31.282 --> 23:32.283
Aloha.

23:40.792 --> 23:42.793
Missa Gates! Missa Gates!

23:42.794 --> 23:44.795
Missa Gates! Missa Gates!
Missa Gates!

23:44.796 --> 23:46.747
Missa Gates,
guess who here!

23:46.748 --> 23:47.798
He's home!

23:47.799 --> 23:49.299
Just drive up in car,
all the way from Army!

23:49.300 --> 23:50.300
Who?

23:50.301 --> 23:51.802
Our boy Chadwick!

23:51.803 --> 23:52.803
Chadwick!

23:52.804 --> 23:54.805
Oh, daddy, Jack,
it's Chadwick!

23:54.806 --> 23:56.807
My boy's home
from the war!

23:56.808 --> 23:58.809
Sarah Lee, there
wasn't any war.

23:59.811 --> 24:01.311
Well, don't just
stand there!

24:01.312 --> 24:02.312
Aloha.

24:02.313 --> 24:04.314
Chadwick?

24:04.315 --> 24:05.816
Oh, Chadwick, my boy!

24:05.817 --> 24:06.817
Hiya, Mom!

24:06.818 --> 24:08.318
Welcome home, son.

24:08.319 --> 24:09.319
Hi, Pop. Hey, Jack!

24:09.320 --> 24:10.821
Didn't expect
to see you here.

24:10.822 --> 24:11.822
Arrived yesterday.

24:11.823 --> 24:12.823
Just checking up
on your old man.

24:12.824 --> 24:13.824
You're looking
good, fella.

24:13.825 --> 24:14.825
Thank you.

24:14.826 --> 24:16.326
Ping Pong, will you
shut off that water?

24:16.327 --> 24:17.828
Don't get wet.

24:20.331 --> 24:21.832
Hello, Mr. Chadwick.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.834
You have swinging
time in Europe?

24:23.835 --> 24:26.336
Pingo,
the swingingest, boy.

24:26.337 --> 24:27.337
How are you,
boy?

24:27.338 --> 24:28.339
Hi, Jack. Hi, Pop.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.280
Doesn't he look
marvelous in uniform?

24:30.341 --> 24:31.341
Go get the camera,
daddy.

24:31.342 --> 24:32.843
Later, Sarah Lee.
Later.

24:32.844 --> 24:34.845
Come on in. We got
so much to talk about.

24:34.846 --> 24:36.847
I have to get my bags, Mom.

24:36.848 --> 24:38.849
Don't worry, Mr. Chadwick.
I get bags...

24:41.352 --> 24:42.853
Aloha!

24:45.356 --> 24:47.357
I got it!
I got it!

24:47.358 --> 24:48.859
Ping Pong,

24:48.860 --> 24:51.361
tell cook we'll let her know
when to start serving.

24:51.362 --> 24:52.863
We want to talk
to our boy.

24:52.864 --> 24:54.364
<i>Oui, oui,</i>
missy.

24:54.365 --> 24:57.367
We must give
a welcome-home party for Chadwick, daddy,

24:57.368 --> 24:58.869
and it could be
for Jack, too.

24:58.870 --> 25:00.370
Oh, forget about
me, Sarah Lee.

25:00.371 --> 25:01.872
Just invite
Chad's friends.

25:01.873 --> 25:04.374
You mean those nasty
little beach boys?

25:04.375 --> 25:05.876
Oh, no. Now that
Chadwick's home,

25:05.877 --> 25:07.878
I'm sure he's got
all that foolishness

25:07.879 --> 25:10.380
out of his system...
After the war.

25:10.381 --> 25:11.381
Sarah Lee,

25:11.382 --> 25:13.383
how many times do
I have to tell you,

25:13.384 --> 25:14.885
he was not in a war.

25:14.886 --> 25:16.386
Oh, I know
you're right, daddy,

25:16.387 --> 25:18.889
but if I don't tell
myself there was a war,

25:18.890 --> 25:20.891
I have a most
depressing feeling

25:20.892 --> 25:22.893
Chadwick's
just wasted 2 years.

25:22.894 --> 25:25.897
Chadwick, sweet boy.

25:26.898 --> 25:28.899
Sure feels good to get
back into civvies, Mom.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.901
Oh, why'd you take off
your soldier suit?

25:30.902 --> 25:32.402
You looked
so handsome in it,

25:32.403 --> 25:33.904
just like
Stonewall Jackson.

25:33.905 --> 25:36.406
Hey, you got some sugar
for your mama?

25:36.407 --> 25:38.408
How about a drink
before dinner, civilian?

25:38.409 --> 25:39.910
Why don't you give him

25:39.911 --> 25:41.411
some of your
pineapple juice, Jack?

25:41.412 --> 25:42.913
Missed it, huh, boy?

25:42.914 --> 25:43.914
Yeah.

25:43.915 --> 25:45.916
You should try
the new rum drink.

25:45.917 --> 25:46.917
Jack...

25:46.918 --> 25:48.919
Chadwick's
a growing boy, Fred,

25:48.920 --> 25:51.421
and I don't think it
proper for his daddy

25:51.422 --> 25:52.923
to give him
intoxicating libations.

25:52.924 --> 25:54.875
Mom, I'd like to
tell you about the...

25:54.876 --> 25:56.927
We were just talking
about your party, son.

25:56.928 --> 25:59.429
What party?
Your coming-home party

25:59.430 --> 26:01.932
to celebrate your return
from the war.

26:01.933 --> 26:04.434
We can have the Wilsons
and the pomfrets.

26:04.435 --> 26:05.436
Oh, yes,
they're a must.

26:05.937 --> 26:08.939
They get absolutely
hilarious at parties.

26:08.940 --> 26:11.942
They get
absolutely stoned, is what they get.

26:11.943 --> 26:12.943
Yes.

26:12.944 --> 26:13.945
Uh, Chadwick,

26:14.445 --> 26:15.946
I think it would be
much impressier

26:15.947 --> 26:18.949
if you wore your uniform
with all the medals you won.

26:18.950 --> 26:20.951
I didn't win
any medals, Mom.

26:20.952 --> 26:22.452
Of course
you won medals.

26:22.453 --> 26:23.954
What were all those
on your soldier suit?

26:23.955 --> 26:25.455
Just marksmanship
and good conduct.

26:25.456 --> 26:26.957
Oh, you see, daddy?

26:26.958 --> 26:28.458
Every soldier wins one

26:28.459 --> 26:30.460
if he hits the target
instead of an officer.

26:30.461 --> 26:31.962
Oh, you put me in mind

26:31.963 --> 26:33.463
of my great-grandfather
on my side,

26:33.464 --> 26:34.965
Captain Matthew Polk.

26:34.966 --> 26:36.974
Oh, he was one
o <i>the</i> bravest men

26:36.975 --> 26:38.976
in the war
between the states.

26:38.977 --> 26:40.978
Oh, the daring deeds
that man performed,

26:40.979 --> 26:42.479
his bravery under fire,

26:42.480 --> 26:44.982
his courage
on the field of battle

26:44.983 --> 26:47.484
made us all proud
to be Polks.

26:47.485 --> 26:49.486
Oh, it's such a shame

26:49.487 --> 26:51.989
Captain Polk
was a damn yankee.

26:51.990 --> 26:54.492
Chad, which one
do you want?

26:56.494 --> 26:58.495
Well, let me see.

26:58.496 --> 27:00.498
You need it, boy.
Take your pick.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.500
Whew.
I think I'll stick

27:03.501 --> 27:05.002
to the straight
pineapple juice.

27:05.003 --> 27:07.505
We must decide
on the orchestra for the party.

27:08.006 --> 27:09.246
Oh, well,
if you'll excuse me,

27:09.507 --> 27:11.387
I think I'll freshen up
a little before dinner.

27:11.509 --> 27:12.009
Aloha.

27:12.510 --> 27:13.510
Yeah.

27:13.511 --> 27:15.191
Orchestra? Say, Mom,
how about my friends?

27:15.513 --> 27:16.593
You mean those
native boys?

27:17.015 --> 27:18.455
The swingingest group
in the islands.

27:18.516 --> 27:20.017
Oh, they are not
musicians, Chadwick.

27:20.518 --> 27:21.519
They're just
beach boys.

27:22.020 --> 27:23.340
Mom, they've turned
professional.

27:23.521 --> 27:24.881
They do a lot of work
around town.

27:25.023 --> 27:26.024
How'd you know that?

27:26.524 --> 27:27.525
Uh, why...

27:28.026 --> 27:29.027
he corresponded
with them

27:29.527 --> 27:31.028
while he was
in Europe.

27:31.529 --> 27:33.030
Now, Chadwick,
we might as well

27:33.531 --> 27:35.032
have an understanding
right off.

27:35.533 --> 27:37.034
You've come home
to stay,

27:37.535 --> 27:39.537
and your life's
going to be different.

27:40.038 --> 27:41.398
You're going
to associate yourself

27:41.539 --> 27:43.540
with the finer elements
on this island,

27:43.541 --> 27:46.043
and you're going to have
a responsible position

27:46.044 --> 27:48.045
with the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company,

27:48.046 --> 27:51.048
and you're going to marry
a girl of your own class

27:51.049 --> 27:53.051
and be a gentleman
like your daddy.

27:54.052 --> 27:56.054
Mom, do we have to
discuss this now?

27:56.554 --> 27:59.056
Yes. I don't want you
wasting your precious time

27:59.557 --> 28:01.558
on those beach boys
or that native girl.

28:01.559 --> 28:04.561
Sarah Lee,
the boy just came home.

28:04.562 --> 28:05.904
I think
he should know

28:05.905 --> 28:07.906
exactly what
we expect of him.

28:07.907 --> 28:09.407
I know what
you expect of me.

28:09.408 --> 28:11.409
I thought maybe after
a hitch in the army,

28:11.410 --> 28:13.411
I could come back and
do what you want me to,

28:13.412 --> 28:14.913
but now I know I can't.

28:14.914 --> 28:16.915
Well, how do you know?
You just got back.

28:16.916 --> 28:18.917
I've been back
for 5 days, Mom.

28:18.918 --> 28:19.918
5 days?

28:19.919 --> 28:21.920
Yes, and for 5 days,
I've been at the beach,

28:21.921 --> 28:23.421
living in my shack
and dreading the time

28:23.422 --> 28:25.423
I would have to come
back here and tell you

28:25.424 --> 28:26.925
I'm not going to
go to work

28:26.926 --> 28:28.927
for the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.

28:28.928 --> 28:29.928
Sarah Lee.

28:29.929 --> 28:31.429
Yes, daddy?

28:31.430 --> 28:33.431
Let's talk about it
tomorrow, son.

28:33.432 --> 28:34.432
Home 5 days,

28:34.433 --> 28:36.434
and he didn't even
come to his mother.

28:36.435 --> 28:38.436
Mom, it's time
I started

28:38.437 --> 28:39.938
doing something
for myself,

28:39.939 --> 28:41.440
like making my
own decisions.

28:42.942 --> 28:45.410
Chadwick!

28:45.411 --> 28:46.444
Chadwick!

28:46.445 --> 28:47.946
Your mother
hasn't finished,

28:47.947 --> 28:49.948
and you haven't
had your dinner.

28:49.949 --> 28:51.449
All of a sudden,
I'm not hungry.

28:51.450 --> 28:52.451
Good night.

28:56.956 --> 28:58.957
And he didn't even
give his mama

28:58.958 --> 28:59.959
any good-night sugar.

29:00.459 --> 29:01.960
Sarah Lee,
there are times

29:02.461 --> 29:04.463
when I could wring
your fool neck.

29:21.981 --> 29:24.483
Good evening, sir.
I'll take care of your car.

29:24.984 --> 29:25.984
Thank you.

30:13.499 --> 30:14.532
Grandma!

30:14.533 --> 30:16.534
No! No, no.

30:16.535 --> 30:19.037
No, no, no!

30:37.556 --> 30:39.557
Well, it is a pleasant
surprise, Chad.

30:39.558 --> 30:41.059
Thanks, Mr. Duval.

30:41.060 --> 30:42.560
We were not
expecting you.

30:42.561 --> 30:45.563
I just came by
to pay my respects to Maile's grandmother.

30:45.564 --> 30:47.065
Maile!

30:49.068 --> 30:50.568
We have a visitor.

30:50.569 --> 30:52.070
He says he dropped by

30:52.071 --> 30:54.573
to pay his respects
to your grandmother.

30:55.074 --> 30:56.075
Excuse me.

30:56.575 --> 30:58.076
I thought
you were going home.

30:58.577 --> 31:00.578
I did. I'm out
on good behavior.

31:00.579 --> 31:02.080
Mmm.

31:02.081 --> 31:04.083
Your father said he
was glad to see me.

31:04.583 --> 31:06.585
Well, I'm glad
to see you, too.

31:08.087 --> 31:10.088
Come wish grandmother
a happy birthday.

31:10.089 --> 31:13.092
Grandmother,
you remember Chad.

31:13.592 --> 31:16.094
I am delighted
to see you again, Chad.

31:16.095 --> 31:17.596
Welcome back
from the army.

31:18.097 --> 31:19.657
Aloha, Mrs. manaka,
and happy birthday.

31:20.099 --> 31:22.100
I brought you
a gift from Austria.

31:22.101 --> 31:23.601
Thank you,

31:23.602 --> 31:26.104
but the light you kindle
in my granddaughter's eye

31:26.105 --> 31:27.606
is gift enough.

31:29.108 --> 31:30.608
It's a music box.

31:30.609 --> 31:32.110
It plays a European
love song,

31:32.111 --> 31:34.112
but they're the same
in any language.

31:39.118 --> 31:45.123

And so are you,
grandmother.

33:45.744 --> 33:47.745
Sure beats lunch
in town, doesn't it?

33:47.746 --> 33:49.247
Mmm.

33:49.248 --> 33:51.249
You don't get this view
in town, either.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.253
No, and it was easier
to get a reservation here.

34:13.772 --> 34:15.773
Your grandmother
packs a pretty picnic.

34:15.774 --> 34:18.275
The way
to a man's heart.

34:18.277 --> 34:20.277
She's making sure
I reach yours,

34:20.279 --> 34:22.280
especially after
last night.

34:22.281 --> 34:24.282
She loved the music box.

34:24.283 --> 34:26.784
I'm glad.
She's a wonderful lady.

34:26.784 --> 34:29.286
The difference between
your family and mine.

34:29.288 --> 34:30.788
We're not
our families, Chad.

34:30.789 --> 34:32.790
We're what we make
of ourselves.

34:32.791 --> 34:33.791
You know, you're right.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.793
And if I'm going to make
anything of myself,

34:35.793 --> 34:37.295
it's about time
to get started

34:37.295 --> 34:38.795
and take hold of things.

34:38.797 --> 34:40.799
While you're in the mood
to take hold...

34:44.303 --> 34:46.804
Maile, I've got
to get a job.

34:46.804 --> 34:48.306
And, I gather,

34:48.306 --> 34:50.308
<i>not</i> in your father's
pineapple plant.

34:50.309 --> 34:51.309
No, ma'am.

34:51.310 --> 34:52.310
No red carpet,

34:52.311 --> 34:53.811
where everybody
knows who I am.

34:53.812 --> 34:55.313
"He's the boss' son.
Be nice to him."

34:55.813 --> 34:56.813
that's not for me.

34:56.815 --> 34:58.316
Hawaii has a big future.

34:58.817 --> 35:00.818
I want to become
a part of it.

35:00.819 --> 35:02.820
I'm young and healthy.
I'm not <i>too</i> stupid.

35:02.821 --> 35:03.821
Well, wonderful.

35:03.822 --> 35:05.823
This place is growing
by leaps and bounds.

35:05.824 --> 35:07.144
There are
more tourists come here

35:07.326 --> 35:08.826
than any other state
in the union.

35:08.827 --> 35:09.827
Hey, that's it!

35:09.828 --> 35:11.829
I'm glad you
thought of it.

35:11.830 --> 35:12.831
What did I think of?

35:13.131 --> 35:13.831
Tourist business...
Your business.

35:14.333 --> 35:15.333
It's booming, isn't it?

35:15.334 --> 35:16.834
It's getting bigger
all the time.

35:16.835 --> 35:18.235
I know every inch
of these islands.

35:18.337 --> 35:19.337
I'd make a good
tourist guide.

35:19.338 --> 35:20.658
You'd make a great
tourist guide.

35:20.839 --> 35:21.839
I'll put a word in
with my boss.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.841
No, you don't.
I'll put in my own word.

35:23.842 --> 35:25.843
This mission is
strictly solo, you hear?

35:25.844 --> 35:27.845
You're coming in
loud and proud.

35:27.846 --> 35:29.847
I got to get going.
I got to see your boss!

35:29.848 --> 35:31.849
I've wasted
too much time already.

35:31.850 --> 35:33.851
Chad!

35:33.852 --> 35:36.354
Haven't you
forgotten something?

35:36.355 --> 35:38.357
Oh. Oh, yeah.

35:48.367 --> 35:50.869
Hey! Hey!

35:53.872 --> 35:55.373
What about me?

35:55.374 --> 35:57.376
Oh. Oh, yeah!

36:19.398 --> 36:21.399
These are not
only decorative,

36:21.400 --> 36:23.401
but they keep
my neck warm.

36:23.402 --> 36:26.404
Now, then, let me see.
Where were we?

36:26.405 --> 36:28.406
Uh, we were somewhere,
weren't we?

36:28.407 --> 36:29.907
Oh, yes. I was
telling you about

36:29.908 --> 36:31.409
my having 2 years
at the university

36:31.910 --> 36:33.070
before I went
to the mainland

36:33.412 --> 36:34.912
and joined the army.

36:34.913 --> 36:36.414
The army? Oh.

36:36.415 --> 36:37.415
Well, that's a lovely
organization.

36:37.416 --> 36:38.916
Yes.

36:38.917 --> 36:41.919
And you say you've
lived here for 50 years?

36:41.920 --> 36:44.422
50... No, 15 years,
ever since my father

36:44.423 --> 36:46.424
was transferred from
the Atlanta office.

36:46.425 --> 36:48.926
That's where Chad was born,
Mr. Chapman.

36:48.927 --> 36:50.428
Huh?

36:50.429 --> 36:51.429
Atlanta.

36:51.430 --> 36:54.432
Oh! Oh, he was.
Yes.

36:54.433 --> 36:56.434
Where is
the crouching lion?

36:56.435 --> 36:57.935
That's a rock formation

36:57.936 --> 36:59.937
on a cliff just north
of kaaawa beach.

36:59.938 --> 37:02.440
It used to be
a native fishing shrine.

37:02.441 --> 37:04.942
Well. Say, that's good.
That's very good.

37:04.943 --> 37:08.446
Yes, that's excellent.
I'm testing you, you see.

37:08.447 --> 37:09.947
Have to be on your toes

37:09.948 --> 37:11.449
if you want to work
for a man like me,

37:11.450 --> 37:12.450
eh, Miss Duval?

37:12.451 --> 37:13.451
Yes, sir.

37:13.452 --> 37:15.453
Yes, you do.

37:15.454 --> 37:18.956
Now, then, I am a tourist
from Chillicothe, Ohio,

37:18.957 --> 37:21.459
and I want to see some
night-blooming cereus blossoms.

37:21.460 --> 37:22.960
Where would you
take me?

37:22.961 --> 37:25.463
I would take you
to the Punahou School.

37:25.464 --> 37:27.965
The Punahou... you would?
That is good.

37:27.966 --> 37:30.468
Yes, well...
That's splendid.

37:30.469 --> 37:32.970
This young man knows,
Miss Duval.

37:32.971 --> 37:35.973
I think he might do.
He might.

37:35.974 --> 37:37.975
Well, I'll think it over.

37:37.976 --> 37:39.977
When will you
let me know, sir?

37:39.978 --> 37:41.979
Well, when <i>I</i> know,
of course.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.981
Oh. Yes, sir.

37:43.982 --> 37:45.983
Thank you,
Mr. Chapman.

37:45.984 --> 37:47.986
Thank you,
Mr. Chapman.

37:53.492 --> 37:54.992
Beautiful.

37:54.993 --> 37:56.494
Beautiful!

37:56.495 --> 37:58.497
That's Mr. Chadwick.

37:58.997 --> 38:00.998
Quick, cover it up,
Ping Pong.

38:00.999 --> 38:03.000
I don't want him
to see it.

38:03.001 --> 38:05.002
Oh, everything
looks so festive,

38:05.003 --> 38:06.504
doesn't it, daddy?

38:06.505 --> 38:07.505
Yes.

38:07.506 --> 38:08.506
Where's Chadwick?

38:08.507 --> 38:09.507
He's on the telephone.

38:09.508 --> 38:10.508
Straighten your tie.

38:10.509 --> 38:12.009
Oh, I do hope
he's dressed.

38:12.010 --> 38:13.511
Is he dressed?

38:13.512 --> 38:15.513
He was the last time
I looked.

38:15.514 --> 38:17.515
Fetch me a mai-tai,
Ping Pong.

38:17.516 --> 38:19.016
Oh, we got enough
bar glasses? I'll check.

38:19.017 --> 38:23.021
Oh, do that.
Oh, parties, parties.

38:24.022 --> 38:25.523
Mr. Chapman didn't
promise anything

38:26.024 --> 38:27.024
when I saw him today.

38:27.025 --> 38:29.026
I know, but something
came up unexpectedly,

38:29.027 --> 38:30.528
and he needs you.

38:30.529 --> 38:33.531
It's a new client...
A schoolteacher.

38:33.532 --> 38:34.532
A schoolteacher?

38:34.533 --> 38:36.033
She wants to meet you.

38:36.034 --> 38:37.034
Now?

38:37.035 --> 38:38.536
It won't take long.

38:38.537 --> 38:40.538
Meet me at the
Hawaiian Village Hotel in half an hour.

38:40.539 --> 38:42.039
Suppose she doesn't
like me?

38:42.040 --> 38:43.541
I never had much luck
with schoolteachers.

38:43.542 --> 38:45.042
She'll like you.

38:45.043 --> 38:46.544
Just don't be late.

38:46.545 --> 38:48.045
I'll pick you up.

38:48.046 --> 38:49.547
Pick <i>who</i> up?

38:49.548 --> 38:52.050
10 minutes, OK?
Good-bye.

38:52.551 --> 38:55.052
I have to run out
for about an hour, Mom.

38:55.053 --> 38:57.133
Oh, but you can't.
Our guests will be arriving soon.

38:57.556 --> 38:59.557
We're having
cocktails at 7:00 and dinner at 8:30.

38:59.558 --> 39:01.559
Who was that
on the telephone?

39:01.560 --> 39:02.560
Maile Duval.

39:02.561 --> 39:04.562
I consented to engage
your beach boys

39:04.563 --> 39:07.064
to provide music
for your party, but I will not...

39:07.065 --> 39:09.567
If you want me back in time, let's
not start anything now, please.

39:09.568 --> 39:11.068
Chadwick?
Yes?

39:11.069 --> 39:12.069
Fix your tie.

39:12.070 --> 39:13.071
Ohh...

39:25.584 --> 39:28.085
She's supposed to meet us
right out here.

39:28.086 --> 39:30.087
Have you met her before?

39:30.088 --> 39:31.589
No, I haven't.

39:31.590 --> 39:32.590
We shouldn't
have any difficulty

39:32.591 --> 39:35.092
in finding
a schoolteacher.

39:35.093 --> 39:38.095
I could spot one
a mile away.

39:38.096 --> 39:39.097
Uh-oh.

39:41.099 --> 39:42.600
Mm-hmm.

39:45.103 --> 39:46.604
Good afternoon.

39:46.605 --> 39:47.605
Good afternoon.

39:47.606 --> 39:49.106
I'm Miss Duval

39:49.107 --> 39:50.608
from the Hawaii
tourist guide service,

39:50.609 --> 39:52.109
and this is Mr. Gates.

39:52.110 --> 39:54.111
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ingersol.

39:54.112 --> 39:55.613
And I'm
Abigail Prentace...

39:55.614 --> 39:57.615
How do you do?

39:57.616 --> 39:59.583
The schoolteacher.

39:59.584 --> 40:01.118
Sure...

40:01.119 --> 40:03.621
you can spot them
a mile away.

40:03.622 --> 40:05.122
Won't you join me?

40:05.123 --> 40:06.123
Why, certainly.

40:06.124 --> 40:08.626
We beg your pardon,
ma'am.

40:08.627 --> 40:10.628
I'm terribly sorry.

40:10.629 --> 40:12.630
That's all right,
Miss Duval.

40:12.631 --> 40:14.131
I didn't expect
a tourist guide

40:14.132 --> 40:15.633
dressed
like Mr. Gates.

40:15.634 --> 40:17.134
He <i>is</i> the guide,
isn't he?

40:17.135 --> 40:18.636
Yes, ma'am. These aren't
my working clothes.

40:18.637 --> 40:20.137
My mother's giving
a party tonight.

40:20.138 --> 40:23.140
Mr. Gates comes from one
of our finest families.

40:23.141 --> 40:25.483
Well, that's certainly
in his favor.

40:25.484 --> 40:26.985
I must be
extremely careful

40:26.986 --> 40:28.987
because I'm chaperoning
4 teenage girls.

40:28.988 --> 40:31.489
That's a responsibility
not to be taken lightly.

40:31.490 --> 40:33.491
I get along very well
with teenagers.

40:33.492 --> 40:34.993
I used to be one myself.

40:34.994 --> 40:36.494
And not too long ago.

40:36.495 --> 40:38.497
Frankly, Miss Duval,

40:38.998 --> 40:40.498
I was expecting
an older man.

40:40.499 --> 40:42.500
Miss Prentace,
as part of the service,

40:42.501 --> 40:45.003
I promise to, uh, get a
little older every day.

40:45.004 --> 40:47.505
Of course, if you would
prefer another guide,

40:47.506 --> 40:50.508
I'm sure that the office
could arrange it for you.

40:50.509 --> 40:53.011
We'd like to keep
our customers perfectly satisfied.

40:53.012 --> 40:56.014
Mr. Gates, do you think
you can satisfy

40:56.015 --> 40:58.016
a schoolteacher
and 4 teenage girls?

40:58.017 --> 40:59.517
Oh, I'll sure try,
ma'am.

40:59.518 --> 41:02.020
I-I-I'll do
all I can.

41:02.021 --> 41:03.521
Well, what I mean is,

41:03.522 --> 41:05.523
this is our first trip
to the islands,

41:05.524 --> 41:07.525
and the girls
are naturally curious

41:07.526 --> 41:09.027
about
the local activities,

41:09.028 --> 41:10.528
such as surfboard riding.

41:10.529 --> 41:13.031
Can you arrange
instructions for them?

41:13.032 --> 41:14.032
I'll teach them myself.

41:14.033 --> 41:15.533
You?

41:15.534 --> 41:17.035
I grew up
on a surfboard.

41:17.036 --> 41:19.037
Outriggers, catamarans...
I can handle them all.

41:19.038 --> 41:20.538
How wonderful.

41:20.539 --> 41:23.041
Chad used to be an expert
at all outdoor sports.

41:23.042 --> 41:24.042
Used to be?

41:24.043 --> 41:26.544
Well, before he went
in the army.

41:26.545 --> 41:28.546
He's been gone for 2 years.

41:28.547 --> 41:31.549
He just got back, and I'm
afraid he's a little rusty.

41:31.550 --> 41:34.052
I'm afraid Miss Duval
doesn't realize

41:34.053 --> 41:36.554
how well-oiled
I kept my machinery.

41:36.555 --> 41:40.058
What time do we start
in the morning?

41:40.059 --> 41:41.559
9:00 all right? Here?

41:41.560 --> 41:43.061
We'll be waiting,

41:43.062 --> 41:44.563
and thank you
for coming by.

41:44.847 --> 41:46.564
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

41:46.565 --> 41:48.066
And you.

41:48.067 --> 41:49.068
Thank you.

41:50.569 --> 41:52.070
Maile?

41:59.578 --> 42:01.079
They didn't build
teachers like that when I went to school.

42:01.580 --> 42:05.083
Oh, she's all right,
if you happen to like older women.

42:05.084 --> 42:09.088
If she's older women, the rest of
the group are in big trouble. Ha!

42:10.589 --> 42:12.090
You can drop me off
at my house.

42:12.591 --> 42:14.092
What do you mean
drop you off?

42:14.093 --> 42:15.593
We got to celebrate
my new job.

42:15.594 --> 42:16.595
Aren't you supposed to be
at your mother's party?

42:17.096 --> 42:19.598
Shh. I'm the guide now,
remember?

42:22.134 --> 42:24.102
Oh, do be careful,
daddy.

42:24.103 --> 42:25.603
Those mai-tais can
be mighty powerful.

42:25.604 --> 42:26.604
Yeah!

42:26.605 --> 42:28.106
Oh, thank you,
daddy.

42:28.107 --> 42:29.608
Hello, darlings.

42:30.109 --> 42:31.609
Oh, hello, Mrs. Gates.
This is a lovely party.

42:31.610 --> 42:32.610
Oh, thank you.

42:32.611 --> 42:34.112
I want you to try
some of this dip.

42:34.113 --> 42:35.613
It's an old
Carolina recipe.

42:35.614 --> 42:37.615
My grandmother Polk
brought it all the way

42:37.616 --> 42:39.117
from Charleston
to Savannah.

42:39.118 --> 42:41.119
It's delicious.
Hello, dears.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.120
Good evening.

42:42.121 --> 42:44.623
Oh, isn't it delightful?
It's all so festive.

42:45.124 --> 42:46.624
Oh, Ping Pong,
I want you to be sure

42:46.625 --> 42:48.626
that Mr. karnibad's glass
doesn't get too empty,

42:48.627 --> 42:50.128
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

42:50.129 --> 42:51.129
<i>Oui, oui,</i>
missy.

42:51.130 --> 42:52.130
Oh, that's French.

42:52.131 --> 42:54.133
Ping Pong's learning
to speak it.

42:54.633 --> 42:56.634
So nice of you
to come to my party.

42:56.635 --> 42:59.637
Oh, there you are,
admiral Anthony.

42:59.638 --> 43:02.140
I see you folks have met
admiral Anthony.

43:02.141 --> 43:03.641
General Anthony,
Mrs. Gates.

43:03.642 --> 43:05.643
Oh, you may be
only a general now,

43:05.644 --> 43:07.145
but it's only
a matter of time

43:07.146 --> 43:09.147
before they make you
an admiral.

43:09.148 --> 43:10.149
Hi, Chad.
Hi, Maile.

43:10.649 --> 43:11.650
Hello, everybody.

43:13.652 --> 43:14.652
Daddy?

43:14.653 --> 43:16.654
Excuse me. Yeah?

43:16.655 --> 43:18.156
Look.

43:18.157 --> 43:19.657
Oh, good. Chad's here.

43:19.658 --> 43:21.659
Yeah, but look
who's with him.

43:21.660 --> 43:23.161
It's that girl.

43:23.162 --> 43:24.162
Yes.

43:24.163 --> 43:25.663
She's very attractive.

43:25.664 --> 43:28.666
Daddy, aren't you
forgetting yourself?

43:28.667 --> 43:31.169
I'm trying, mother.
I'm trying.

43:35.174 --> 43:36.674
Well, hello, Maile.

43:36.675 --> 43:38.176
Nice to see
you again.

43:38.677 --> 43:39.677
Thank you.

43:39.678 --> 43:40.678
Maile,
this is my mother.

43:40.679 --> 43:42.180
It's about time
you two met.

43:42.181 --> 43:43.681
Mom, Maile Duval.

43:43.682 --> 43:45.683
Very glad to meet you,
Mrs. Gates.

43:45.684 --> 43:48.186
Chad's talked
so much about you.

43:48.187 --> 43:49.187
He has?

43:49.188 --> 43:51.189
Oh, that's nice,
Chadwick.

43:51.190 --> 43:53.691
Oh, he's talked
about you, too.

43:53.692 --> 43:56.194
Oh, yes. We've both
talked about you.

43:56.195 --> 43:57.196
Ha ha.

43:57.696 --> 43:58.696
Ahem.

43:58.697 --> 44:00.198
Yes.

44:00.199 --> 44:02.700
Hey, men,
looks like Maile's on the rack.

44:02.701 --> 44:05.203
Are you going to stay
for Chadwick's party, Miss Duval?

44:05.204 --> 44:06.704
I'd like to very much.

44:06.705 --> 44:08.206
Well, let's get her off.

46:14.833 --> 46:16.334
Oh.

46:28.847 --> 46:30.348
Good morning,
Miss Prentace.

46:30.349 --> 46:31.849
Good morning,
Miss Duval.

46:31.850 --> 46:33.351
Girls, Miss Duval.

46:33.352 --> 46:34.352
Hello, Miss Duval.

46:34.353 --> 46:35.853
Good morning,
girls.

46:35.854 --> 46:37.355
These are alohas
for you.

46:37.356 --> 46:38.856
How lovely.

46:38.857 --> 46:39.858
Thank you.

46:40.359 --> 46:41.860
Thank you.

46:42.361 --> 46:43.862
Thank you.

46:44.363 --> 46:45.864
Oh, how wonderful.

46:46.365 --> 46:47.866
This is very nice
of you.

46:48.367 --> 46:49.868
Good morning,
Miss Prentace.

46:50.035 --> 46:52.870
Well, I must say,
you look more like a guide this morning.

46:52.871 --> 46:54.873
But you still
don't look like a schoolteacher.

46:55.374 --> 46:56.874
Girls, may I present
our guide?

46:56.875 --> 46:59.877
Shall we start
our tour with the pineapple fields?

46:59.878 --> 47:01.379
I hate
pineapples.

47:01.380 --> 47:02.880
Then let's
go there first

47:02.881 --> 47:04.382
and get it
over with.

47:04.383 --> 47:06.384
Are you going with us?

47:06.385 --> 47:08.386
No, thanks.
I have to get back to my office.

47:08.387 --> 47:10.388
Can we give you
a lift?

47:10.389 --> 47:12.391
Oh, that's not necessary.
It's just a few steps.

47:14.393 --> 47:15.894
Thank you.

47:19.898 --> 47:22.400
I hope you don't mind
being this crowded.

47:22.401 --> 47:23.902
I don't mind at all.

47:26.521 --> 47:28.906
Would you mind
closing the door, please?

47:28.907 --> 47:31.409
Well, have fun.

47:31.410 --> 47:32.911
Aloha.

47:50.929 --> 47:52.931
As you know, girls,
this is the island of Oahu,

47:53.432 --> 47:54.432
and Honolulu,
our capital city,

47:54.433 --> 47:55.933
is the largest
of all the islands.

47:55.934 --> 47:57.435
Anybody know
the population?

47:57.436 --> 47:59.937
Population...
Population...

47:59.938 --> 48:02.440
Last count,
500,409.

48:02.441 --> 48:04.942
Correct.
Give the young lady

48:04.943 --> 48:06.944
a 5-pound box
of broken records.

48:06.945 --> 48:08.446
Call me Beverly.

48:08.447 --> 48:09.947
Right, Bev.

48:09.948 --> 48:10.948
I'm Patsy.

48:10.949 --> 48:13.451
My name's Selena,
but call me Sandy.

48:13.452 --> 48:15.453
And what's
your name?

48:15.454 --> 48:17.955
You may call me
Miss Corbett.

48:17.956 --> 48:19.457
La di da da!

48:19.458 --> 48:21.959
You might be
interested to know that since 1778,

48:21.960 --> 48:24.462
we've been welcoming <i>malihinis</i>
from all over the world.

48:24.463 --> 48:25.463
Welcoming what?

48:25.464 --> 48:27.965
<i>Malihinis</i>.
That's us.

48:27.966 --> 48:29.467
I thought
we were <i>wahines</i>.

48:29.468 --> 48:31.469
You're both.
<i>Malihini</i> means newcomers.

48:31.470 --> 48:32.970
<i>Wahine</i>
means female.

48:32.971 --> 48:34.972
What do you know?
We're <i>wahine malihinis</i>.

48:34.973 --> 48:36.474
Big deal.

48:37.476 --> 48:38.976
Patsy, must you?

48:38.977 --> 48:40.478
I did it!
I'm bored!

48:40.479 --> 48:42.480
That's quite rude, Ellie!
Chad was talking.

48:42.481 --> 48:43.981
That's OK,
Miss Prentace.

48:43.982 --> 48:45.483
Make it louder,
duchess.

All right,
everybody out.

50:30.088 --> 50:33.090
This is one of our
smaller pineapple fields.

50:33.091 --> 50:34.592
What are those
women doing?

50:34.593 --> 50:36.093
They're picking
the ripe fruit.

50:36.094 --> 50:37.694
The conveyor belt
hauls it to the trucks

50:38.096 --> 50:39.096
and then
to the factories.

50:39.097 --> 50:41.599
How come they still
pick them by hand?

50:41.600 --> 50:44.101
Before you pick a pineapple, you
got to be sure it's ripe enough,

50:44.102 --> 50:46.604
and nothing can beat
the human eye in deciding when it's ready.

50:46.605 --> 50:48.105
Well, that's
interesting.

50:48.106 --> 50:50.608
Nobody ever came up
with anything better than the human hand

50:50.609 --> 50:52.729
to reach into
these little leaves and break them off.

50:53.111 --> 50:54.111
That doesn't
look so tough.

50:54.112 --> 50:55.113
Oh, no?
Try it.

50:55.614 --> 50:56.114
Be careful.

50:56.615 --> 50:57.616
Ow! It bites!

50:58.116 --> 51:00.117
See what I mean?
These things are tricky.

51:00.118 --> 51:02.119
They're full of sharp
little edges.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.621
Can you get us
a pineapple, Chad?

51:03.622 --> 51:05.122
Oh, I think that
could be arranged.

51:05.123 --> 51:06.123
Nice, cold slices
of pineapple

51:06.124 --> 51:07.625
at this little stand
right over here.

51:07.626 --> 51:09.126
Pineapples?

51:09.127 --> 51:12.129
What did
you expect? Bananas?

51:12.130 --> 51:14.632
Ellie,
don't you want some?

51:14.633 --> 51:16.634
Hello, Mr. Gates.

51:16.635 --> 51:18.636
Hello. My friends
would like some pineapple.

51:18.637 --> 51:19.637
Certainly.

51:19.638 --> 51:21.138
I bet it's delicious.

51:21.139 --> 51:22.640
I feel like
something cool.

51:22.641 --> 51:24.642
Have you ever
tried it with salt?

51:24.643 --> 51:27.144
Salt?
It's real good.

51:27.145 --> 51:28.646
I'll take this
to Ellie.

51:30.148 --> 51:32.650
Uh, I thought
you might like some.

51:33.151 --> 51:34.151
I don't.

51:34.152 --> 51:36.154
It's good. Why don't
you try it?

51:38.657 --> 51:40.158
Thank you.

51:43.828 --> 51:45.162
That's pretty rude.

51:45.163 --> 51:47.164
Are you always so bored,
or is it me?

51:47.165 --> 51:49.167
Life is a bore,
I always say.

51:49.668 --> 51:50.668
Oh, already?

51:50.669 --> 51:52.169
I've had
17 years of it.

51:52.170 --> 51:55.173
That's the fun part.
Wait till the next 17.

51:55.507 --> 51:58.175
Look, don't you start
that child psychology bit.

51:58.176 --> 51:59.677
I'm no child.

51:59.678 --> 52:01.178
I'm no psychologist.

52:01.179 --> 52:04.682
I believe you're being paid
to show us a good time.

52:04.683 --> 52:06.183
When does it start?

52:06.184 --> 52:08.185
The others seem to be
enjoying themselves.

52:08.186 --> 52:09.687
They're a bunch
of drips.

52:09.688 --> 52:11.689
Then why did you
come over with them?

52:11.690 --> 52:13.190
It wasn't my idea.

52:13.191 --> 52:16.694
I've got 2 mothers
and 3 fathers.

52:16.895 --> 52:19.646
Oh, you must come
from a very rich family.

52:19.647 --> 52:22.199
You're a very funny man.

52:22.200 --> 52:23.201
Now, look, I'm sorry...

52:23.702 --> 52:24.202
Don't be sorry.

52:24.703 --> 52:25.703
Just come up
with some action.

52:25.704 --> 52:26.705
Got a match?

52:27.205 --> 52:28.205
I don't use them.

52:28.206 --> 52:29.206
It figures.

52:29.207 --> 52:31.709
What's your idea
of action?

52:33.712 --> 52:35.212
What's yours?

52:35.213 --> 52:37.715
You're
a very funny girl.

52:37.716 --> 52:39.217
Just wait and see.

53:34.272 --> 53:35.773
Yes, Mr. Chapman?

53:35.774 --> 53:38.275
Miss Duval, come
in here, please.

53:38.276 --> 53:40.277
Yes, sir.

53:40.278 --> 53:42.279
Yes, now, dear, but...

53:42.280 --> 53:44.782
Well, I certainly will,
dear. Of course.

53:44.783 --> 53:47.284
All right.
8:30 sharp, huh?

53:47.285 --> 53:49.286
All right, dear.
Good-bye.

53:49.287 --> 53:50.788
Just talked to my wife.

53:50.789 --> 53:53.290
I promised to take her
to the concert tonight.

53:53.291 --> 53:55.793
Oh, I must remember
that, too. The concert.

53:55.794 --> 53:58.796
Now, then, Miss Duval,
what is it you want?

53:58.797 --> 54:00.799
Uh, Mr. Chapman,
you sent for me.

54:01.299 --> 54:02.299
I did?

54:02.300 --> 54:04.301
Well, what is it
I want?

54:04.302 --> 54:06.304
Has it anything
to do with Chad?

54:06.805 --> 54:07.806
Chad who?

54:08.306 --> 54:10.307
Chad Gates,
remember?

54:10.308 --> 54:11.809
Oh! Oh, yes.

54:11.810 --> 54:13.811
Oh, say,
he's a fine-looking boy.

54:13.812 --> 54:15.813
He's bright, too.
We should hire him.

54:15.814 --> 54:17.815
He's been working
for you for 2 days.

54:17.816 --> 54:20.818
He's the guide
for Miss Prentace and the girls.

54:20.819 --> 54:22.319
Uh, gir... girls?

54:22.320 --> 54:24.321
Wait a minute.
Look here.

54:24.322 --> 54:26.824
I don't want
any of my guides carrying on with girls.

54:26.825 --> 54:28.826
There's no hanky-panky
on this job.

54:28.827 --> 54:30.327
Mr. Chapman,
it's all right.

54:30.328 --> 54:32.329
He's just showing them
the local color.

54:32.330 --> 54:34.832
Tonight, he's taking
them to a <i>hukilau.</i>

54:34.833 --> 54:36.333
Hukilau, eh?

54:36.334 --> 54:38.336
Oh, well,
that sounds like fun.

54:38.837 --> 54:39.837
Oh, my fish.

54:39.838 --> 54:42.339
Well, you should
enjoy that.

54:42.340 --> 54:43.841
I'm not going.

54:43.842 --> 54:46.844
He's taking
Miss Prentace and the girls.

54:46.845 --> 54:48.345
Ah, Miss Prentace.

54:48.346 --> 54:50.848
Oh, she's a lovely woman,
that Miss Prentace.

54:50.849 --> 54:52.349
They make
a handsome couple...

54:52.350 --> 54:53.851
Yes, young Gates
and Miss Prentace.

54:54.352 --> 54:55.352
They do?

54:55.353 --> 54:56.854
Yes.

54:56.855 --> 54:58.856
Miss Prentace is quite
taken with the boy, too.

54:58.857 --> 55:00.357
She's even extended
her tour.

55:00.358 --> 55:04.361
Now, <i>that's</i> hanky-panky
from where I stand.

55:04.362 --> 55:07.364
What? Oh, excuse me.
Well, please sit down.

55:07.365 --> 55:09.366
No, Mr. Chapman,
that's all right.

55:09.367 --> 55:10.868
I don't need a seat.

55:10.869 --> 55:12.369
Oh. Well, I do.

55:12.370 --> 55:14.371
I'll take 2
for the concert.

55:14.372 --> 55:15.873
Oh, that concert.

55:15.874 --> 55:17.875
That's what I wanted
to speak to you about.

55:17.876 --> 55:21.378
I was wondering, would you care to
take my wife to the concert tonight?

55:21.379 --> 55:23.380
I'm afraid I can't.
I've decided

55:23.381 --> 55:25.382
I'd better go
to the <i>hukilau.</i>

55:25.383 --> 55:26.884
The <i>hukilau?</i>

55:26.885 --> 55:28.886
Well, if you
can't make it,

55:28.887 --> 55:31.388
I'll just have to go to
the concert by myself.

55:31.389 --> 55:32.890
Yes, Mr. Chapman.

55:32.891 --> 55:35.392
Huh. <i>Huk... hukilau.</i>

55:35.393 --> 55:37.895
Oh, my fish. I... yeah.

55:37.896 --> 55:42.399
Yeah. Come on, boys.
Come on.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.401
You girls, too. There.

55:44.402 --> 55:45.903
Oh, Chad!
May I help you?

55:45.904 --> 55:47.905
Oh, that's all right.
I'll help him.

55:47.906 --> 55:49.407
No, we're OK.
We'll talk later.

55:49.908 --> 55:50.408
Girls?

55:50.909 --> 55:53.911
Patsy? Beverly? Sandy?
Come on.

55:53.912 --> 55:56.413
Chad, why don't you go get
some firewood for dinner?

55:56.414 --> 55:57.414
Firewood?

55:57.415 --> 55:59.417
Man, you'll eat
anything.

56:01.126 --> 56:02.127
Hey,
watch it, man.

56:02.628 --> 56:03.748
Isn't this
a beautiful spot?

56:04.129 --> 56:05.630
Lovely. Look at
the palm trees.

56:05.631 --> 56:07.633
Come on, ito,
start the fire.

56:13.639 --> 56:15.641
Do you want
some help? What?

56:18.644 --> 56:20.144
What are you trying
to do, Ellie?

56:20.145 --> 56:21.145
I did it.

56:21.146 --> 56:22.146
Well, congratulations.

56:22.147 --> 56:24.148
Didn't you like it?

56:24.149 --> 56:25.650

might like it?

The last few days,

01:03:06.475 --> 01:03:08.977
I don't know what time
that boy's gotten in.

01:03:08.978 --> 01:03:10.979
It must have been
after 1:00 last night.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.481
I woke up when I heard
our dog barking,

01:03:13.482 --> 01:03:15.984
and I thought Chadwick
was coming in then.

01:03:15.985 --> 01:03:17.986
But then I realized
it couldn't be,

01:03:17.987 --> 01:03:19.988
because we
don't have a dog.

01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:21.990
Are you listening
to me, daddy?

01:03:21.991 --> 01:03:23.992
Hmm? Oh, yes!

01:03:23.993 --> 01:03:25.994
Oh, Ping Pong,
my eggs are cold.

01:03:25.995 --> 01:03:28.997
Take them back
and warm them up, <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

01:03:28.998 --> 01:03:30.999
<i>Oui, oui,</i> missy.
Morning, Mr. Chadwick.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.500
Hi, Ping.

01:03:32.501 --> 01:03:34.502
You want some
cold eggs?

01:03:34.503 --> 01:03:36.504
No, thanks.
I'll stick to juice and coffee.

01:03:36.505 --> 01:03:38.897
Thank you.
Good morning, Mom, Pop.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.399
Morning, Chadwick.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.401
You got some sugar
for your mama this morning?

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.403
You're up early
this morning, young man.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.405
Have to, Pop.
I got a job.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.906
A job? Working?

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.408
Sure.
For the last 3 days,

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.909
I've been
a full-fledged employee

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.911
of the Hawaiian
tourist guide service.

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.413
Oh, Chadwick,
how could you?

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.415
I thought you wanted
me to work, Mom.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.917
Oh, not as
a common employee.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.419
Acting as
a messenger boy

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.920
for a group
of tourists

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.922
when you could follow in
your daddy's footsteps,

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.424
wind up
as the vice president

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:06.925
of the Great Southern
Hawaiian fruit?

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.927
I fail to comprehend
you, Chadwick.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.429
I like my job, Mom.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.930
It's fun,
it's interesting,

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:13.432
and I meet a lot
of nice people.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:16.436
Nonsense!
Tourists aren't people.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.437
They're...
They're tourists.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:21.440
Easy, Sarah Lee.
I'm very sensitive.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.441
Hi, Jack.
Morning, Jack.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.444
Good morning.
Tell me, Chad,

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:26.945
where does
another tourist meet

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:28.947
these nice people
you talk about?

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.449
Why don't you
try the island inn?

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.450
They're having
a luau tonight.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.952
Boy, I am late.
I've got a meeting

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.954
with the grievance
committee this morning.

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:36.956
Want to sit in, Jack?

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:38.957
Not me.
I'm on vacation.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:39.958
Could you
drop me off, dad? Sure.

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:40.959
Where's
your car, son?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.962
I don't need it.
I can drive the company car.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:44.963
Bye, Mom, Jack.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.465
Bye, mother.
See you tonight.

It's a disgrace.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:00.479
I don't know.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.981
When you married Fred,
he was just a chauffeur,

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:05.984
driving bananas around
in my old truck.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:09.488

A mai-tai.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:27.125
Here. You finish this one.
I'll order another.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.126
Uh, Miss.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:31.129
Miss, another of these
little tummy-warmers.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.631

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.649
I sure do like
a pretty little French girl.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.651

I thought this tourist
guide idea of yours

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.967
would teach you
some responsibility.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:19.978
But he's just
been released.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.479
Released?
That's not right.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.481
Not at all.
He's a violent boy!

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.484
Just a minute. I happen
to be this boy's father.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.485
Runs in the family,
so watch it.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.987

at any minute.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.488
Oh, Mrs. Garvey!

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.490

how wild he is.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.992

all about it.

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:35.994
Didn't you, Mrs...
Oh, my goodness!

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:38.497
You should
never wear green with that eye.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:39.998
Ow!

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:42.500
Who is this
character, anyway?

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.002
This is my boss, dad.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.004
Your ex-boss.
You're fired, young man!

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.506
Mr. Chapman,
he was only protecting your clients.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.008
You can't fire him.

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.010
Yes, I can.
I'll do it again.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.512
Just watch me.
You're fired! You see?

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:57.015
Why don't you give me
a chance to explain what happened?

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.017
I don't want any
explana... I want the money. $700.

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.518
What for?

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.520
To cover for the damages
your son caused.

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:04.022
What a mess it was.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.523
I haven't got $700.

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.026
You haven't got...
Then your father will have to pay it!

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.527
I will not!

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.529
It's OK. The newspapers
will be on my side.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.031
What do you mean?
What newspapers?

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.532
The newspapers
I give the story to...

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.534
About how a guide from
your tourist service got into a fight

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.036
and everybody
wound up in jail,

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:19.537
including one
of the tourists.

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:20.538
That's good,
isn't it?

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.040
Yeah, that's good.
No, it's bad!

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.541
That's very bad
for business.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:25.543
I'll sue the newspapers.
That's what I'll do.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.045
That's good, isn't it?

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:28.546
Yes.
That's good.

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:31.049
I'll waive the release
and go back to my cell.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.550
No, you won't.
He can't do that!

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.552
He's going to ruin
my business.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:37.055
I demand, Lieutenant,
that you rel... release...

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:38.556
whatever.
Send him home.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.508
Just send him home,
that's all.

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.561
He's free to go.

01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:44.062
Come on, Chad.
Let's go.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:47.065
Miss Duval,
I'll see you back at the office.

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:49.567
No, you won't,
Mr. Chapman. I just quit.

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:51.569
Ah, you think she...
Quit?!

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.071
You can't do that!

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.073
Yes, I can,
and I'll do it again.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:57.576
Watch.
I quit! See?

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:09.088
My baby!

01:15:10.289 --> 01:15:13.091
Oh, my baby!

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.593
Oh, my baby's home
from the big house!

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.596
Oh, Sarah Lee,
will you forget those old movies?

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:21.099
Oh, you are all right,
aren't you, Chadwick?

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.101
They didn't grill you
under a lamp or anything?

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.103
No, Mom.
No grilling, no lamp.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.604
I'm just fine.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:29.107
I do hope this doesn't
get back home.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.609
Daddy, there hasn't
been a Gates in jail

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.612
since the revenuers caught your
moonshining uncle squeezing corn.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:37.115
He was your uncle,
Sarah Lee. He was a Polk.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:40.118
Mom, I'm sorry,
honestly, but it wasn't my fault.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:43.121
Oh, I know that, dear.
It's your friends.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:46.624
Mostly that Duval girl.
She's the one to blame.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.126
Maile had nothing
to do with it.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.628
Well, she was there,
wasn't she?

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.130
You got that job working
in her tourist place.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:54.133
Well, who else
can we blame?

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.134
She's pulling you down
to her level.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.635
I won't listen
to that kind of talk.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.137
Then listen to this.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:01.139
You've tried it your way,
and you've made a mess of it.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.640
Now you'll
try it <i>our</i> way,

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.142
and our way means
no more beach friends

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.643
and no more
harebrained jobs.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.145
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:09.147
Yes. I can't promise
I'll go along with it.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:12.150
If you remain in this house,
you'll go along with it.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.653
I'm sorry. You just made
the decision for me.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:19.157
Chadwick!
Think of who you are.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.160
Remember, you come
from a fine family.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:25.663
You'll do enough remembering
for both of us, Mom.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.665
Oh, daddy!

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:31.169
What did we
do wrong?

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.173
Offhand, I'd say
we got married.

01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:56.694
This is the life,
isn't it?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.196
How do you like
being unemployed? I don't.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:00.698
How would you like
to be married? Are you asking?

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.700
Not till I know
what the answer's going to be.

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:05.203
One more setback,
and I'll establish a new record...

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:07.205
First man ever to lose
a home, a family,

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:09.207
a job, and a girl
all in one day.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.709
You were perfectly right
in what you did. Yeah?

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:15.213
Chad, don't quit.
Bounce right back.

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.215
There's so much
you can do.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:19.217
Yeah. I can be
a tourist guide.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.219
Miss Prentace thought
you were a good guide.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.222
I saw her at the office
when I picked up my things.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:26.724
She really blasted
Mr. Chapman for firing you.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.726
She canceled
the rest of her tour.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:31.229
She seems to think
a lot of you.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.231
I'm sorry
about the tour.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.733
I really think she was
enjoying herself.

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:37.735
I know she was.

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.737
She's not taking
the girls home, is she?

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:42.240
Unless she signs on
with another guide service.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:45.743
But I'm more concerned
about your plans than hers.

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.745
- Maile, you're a wonderful girl!
- I am?

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:48.746
You're pretty, too.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:50.248
Not only wonderful
and pretty, you got a brain.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:53.251
I'm so glad
I was able to help.

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.752
Bye. Take care
of my board, OK?

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:55.753
- Where are you going?
- See Miss Prentace.

01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:57.756
Miss Prentace?

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.260
We just made a deal
to continue the tour.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.261
Now, if you'll
follow through...

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.263
Plane reservations

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:08.766
and hotel accommodations
at Kauai.

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:10.768
I'll do what I can.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:13.271
By the way,
congratulations.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:15.274
Was she hard to convince?

01:18:15.741 --> 01:18:19.615
Uh... Nah. She was
all for the idea.

01:18:21.617 --> 01:18:24.619
That's right.
3 days.

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.121
When I come back,
we'll celebrate.

01:18:27.122 --> 01:18:29.624
Good-bye, honey.

01:19:12.668 --> 01:19:14.169
OK, girls,
let's go inside.

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:15.671
Hello.

01:19:17.172 --> 01:19:18.673
OK, girls.
Follow your luggage.

01:19:18.674 --> 01:19:19.675
Isn't this beautiful?

01:19:20.175 --> 01:19:21.676
Look at
the palm trees!

01:19:21.677 --> 01:19:23.177
And the bridge
over the lagoon.

01:19:23.178 --> 01:19:24.679
Yes, it's nice.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.681
Oh, I'm going
to like it here.

01:19:26.682 --> 01:19:29.684
We'll meet in the
lobby in half an hour, girls.

01:19:29.685 --> 01:19:32.186
Beverly, you come with me.
We're rooming together.

01:19:32.187 --> 01:19:34.189
Put on your riding clothes, girls.

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:36.191
I'll arrange
for the horses.

That's for dinner,
girls.

01:21:23.298 --> 01:21:25.800
Ooh. I'm starved.
I could eat a horse.

01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:27.301
Please,
make it mine.

01:21:27.302 --> 01:21:29.303
Shall we go in
to dinner now?

01:21:29.304 --> 01:21:31.305
We'll have to wait
to be called.

01:21:31.306 --> 01:21:33.307
Oh. Well, uh, who's
going to call us?

01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:43.317
That's the traditional
Hawaiian way

01:21:43.318 --> 01:21:44.819
of announcing
that chow's on.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:45.821
Oh!

01:22:47.382 --> 01:22:48.383
Pretty impressive, huh?

01:22:48.884 --> 01:22:49.884
Beautiful.
Indeed.

01:22:51.386 --> 01:22:52.387
Shall we, ladies?

01:22:52.888 --> 01:22:53.888
Mmm, yes.

01:22:53.889 --> 01:22:54.890
Duchess?

01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:56.891
Dinner is served.

01:23:08.904 --> 01:23:10.405
Oh, this one
and that one.

01:23:10.906 --> 01:23:11.906
Did you tell Chad
you were coming?

01:23:11.907 --> 01:23:14.408
No. I want
to surprise him.

01:23:14.409 --> 01:23:15.910
Are you sure
Miss Prentace

01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:17.411
is staying
at the same hotel?

01:23:17.412 --> 01:23:18.913
I made the
reservations myself.

01:23:18.914 --> 01:23:20.915
You're almost as anxious
to get to the hotel as I am.

01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.416
I have business there.

01:23:22.417 --> 01:23:23.918
So have i.

01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:25.420
Here you are.

01:24:16.922 --> 01:24:19.924
Hi, Chad!
What do you want?

01:24:19.925 --> 01:24:22.426
Shh!
Uh-uh. Off limits. Back to your room.

01:24:22.427 --> 01:24:25.930
I couldn't sleep there.

01:24:25.931 --> 01:24:27.932
Well, you sure can't
sleep here. You...

01:24:27.933 --> 01:24:29.934
Whew! That perfume!

01:24:29.935 --> 01:24:31.936
You ought
to take a bath.

01:24:31.937 --> 01:24:34.438
On second thought,
you ought to take a cold shower.

01:24:34.439 --> 01:24:35.940
Chad, I'm lonesome.

01:24:35.941 --> 01:24:37.441
I want someone
to talk to.

01:24:37.442 --> 01:24:38.482
What about
your roommates?

01:24:38.944 --> 01:24:39.944
They're sleeping.

01:24:39.945 --> 01:24:42.446
Well, that's where
you should be... in bed!

01:24:42.447 --> 01:24:44.949
I am in bed.

01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:47.952
Uh-oh.

01:24:47.953 --> 01:24:49.921
Hello?

01:24:49.922 --> 01:24:52.456
This is Maile.
I just got in.

01:24:52.457 --> 01:24:54.959
Oh, Maile.
You just got in where?

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.460
Here at the hotel.

01:24:56.461 --> 01:24:59.463
I thought it would be
a surprise.

01:24:59.464 --> 01:25:00.965
S-s-surprise?

01:25:00.966 --> 01:25:02.466
It... it is.

01:25:02.467 --> 01:25:04.468
I mean, I'm glad
you're here.

01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:06.470
Are you receiving
visitors?

01:25:06.471 --> 01:25:09.473
Well, I was just
getting ready for bed.

01:25:09.474 --> 01:25:12.477
It's been a rough day,
and I'm tired.

01:25:12.561 --> 01:25:13.978
Am I getting the brush?

01:25:13.979 --> 01:25:17.481
No, no.

01:25:17.482 --> 01:25:18.983
No!

01:25:18.984 --> 01:25:19.984
No.

01:25:19.985 --> 01:25:22.487
I'll meet you in the bar
in 5 minutes.

01:25:22.704 --> 01:25:24.489
Well, then.
That's better.

01:25:25.991 --> 01:25:27.992
Well, at least
we have 5 minutes.

01:25:27.993 --> 01:25:30.494
<i>I</i> have 5 minutes.
Your time is up,

01:25:30.495 --> 01:25:31.996
miss oversexed
and underage.

01:25:31.997 --> 01:25:33.497
I spent
one night in jail on account of you.

01:25:33.498 --> 01:25:35.499
That's when I knew.
Knew what?

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.503
When you fought with Mr. Garvey
at that party, I knew you cared.

01:25:39.504 --> 01:25:41.005
I wasn't fighting
over you.

01:25:41.006 --> 01:25:44.008
No? Don't you think
I'm worth fighting for?

01:25:44.009 --> 01:25:45.509
I think you're
a mixed-up kid

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:47.011
that's too big
for her britches.

01:25:47.012 --> 01:25:49.513
I don't wear britches.

01:25:49.514 --> 01:25:51.515
You're getting out
of here right now,

01:25:51.516 --> 01:25:52.516
miss no-britches
Bardot!

01:25:52.517 --> 01:25:54.518
Chad, do you think
I'm pretty?

01:25:54.519 --> 01:25:56.520
I think
you're pretty forward and pretty stupid.

01:25:56.521 --> 01:25:59.023
Wouldn't you rather
hold me than old Abigail?

01:25:59.024 --> 01:26:01.526
I'd like to hold you
over a barbecue pit.

01:26:03.028 --> 01:26:04.528
Who is it?

01:26:04.529 --> 01:26:06.530
Us! Patsy!
And Sandy!

01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:08.532
What is this,
game night at Coco Palms?

01:26:08.533 --> 01:26:10.534
We've got
to see you. It's important.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.540
What are you
doing here? We're looking for Ellie.

01:26:16.541 --> 01:26:18.543
Has she been here?
This is my room. Out!

01:26:19.044 --> 01:26:21.045
And that's my perfume!
And she's wearing my peignoir!

01:26:21.046 --> 01:26:22.547
You're ruining
my sleep!

01:26:23.048 --> 01:26:24.549
That dirty
little sneak!

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:26.050
Who's a dirty sneak?

01:26:26.051 --> 01:26:27.051
You are!
You stole my perfume!

01:26:27.052 --> 01:26:28.132
You're wearing
my peignoir!

01:26:28.553 --> 01:26:31.055
Shh! Keep quiet, girls!
Ellie was just leaving.

01:26:31.056 --> 01:26:33.057
I don't care what
she's doing, but not in my peignoir.

01:26:33.058 --> 01:26:34.558
Don't you dare!

01:26:34.559 --> 01:26:36.060
You've got
a lot of nerve!

01:26:36.061 --> 01:26:37.061
Go back to your room.
Shh! Shh!

01:26:37.062 --> 01:26:39.063
Go back to your rooms
and settle this.

01:26:39.064 --> 01:26:41.065
I'll depend on you
to explain to them

01:26:41.066 --> 01:26:43.067
what you were doing here
and why you were here.

01:26:43.068 --> 01:26:44.568
Everybody get out,
please.

01:26:46.071 --> 01:26:47.071
Uh, yes?

01:26:47.072 --> 01:26:49.073
Abigail Prentace,
Chad. May I see you?

01:26:49.074 --> 01:26:50.574
Just a second.

01:26:50.575 --> 01:26:53.077
Girls, in the bed...
No, no!

01:26:53.578 --> 01:26:55.580
Come on. Out here.

01:27:00.585 --> 01:27:01.585
Hello.

01:27:01.586 --> 01:27:03.087
I hope I didn't
disturb you.

01:27:03.088 --> 01:27:05.589
I've never been more
disturbed in my life.

01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:10.094
Oh? Well, this is
irregular, I know, but may I come in?

01:27:10.095 --> 01:27:13.097
Sure. Come on in.
We're having open house tonight.

01:27:13.098 --> 01:27:15.099
I was so restless,

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.601
I went out walking
in the moonlight.

01:27:17.602 --> 01:27:20.104
Moonlight in Hawaii can
be rather intoxicating.

01:27:20.105 --> 01:27:23.107
Yeah, I know.
That's why I never touch the stuff.

01:27:23.108 --> 01:27:25.109
I just had to talk
to someone.

01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:27.611
Whatever it is,
this is the night for it.

01:27:27.612 --> 01:27:29.613
Chad? I'm not as young
as you might think I am.

01:27:29.614 --> 01:27:31.115
Oh?

01:27:31.116 --> 01:27:32.116
Not old!

01:27:32.117 --> 01:27:34.118
But a little older
than you...

01:27:34.119 --> 01:27:36.120
not that that should
make a difference.

01:27:36.121 --> 01:27:38.122
No. It doesn't make
any difference.

01:27:38.123 --> 01:27:41.625
You know, I've taken
a vacation every summer,

01:27:41.626 --> 01:27:43.627
looking for...

01:27:43.628 --> 01:27:45.129
well... romance.

01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:46.630
An attractive girl
like you

01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:48.632
shouldn't have any
trouble finding romance.

01:27:48.633 --> 01:27:49.634
Thank you.

01:27:50.018 --> 01:27:52.603
I'll get quickly
to my point.

01:27:52.604 --> 01:27:54.605
When Miss Thackery
first asked me

01:27:54.606 --> 01:27:56.607
to chaperone the girls
on this trip,

01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:58.109
I accepted eagerly.

01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:00.111
I thought it would
insulate me

01:28:00.112 --> 01:28:01.612
against
this frustration.

01:28:01.613 --> 01:28:02.613
Yeah.

01:28:02.614 --> 01:28:04.615
But instead, Chad,
it's happened.

01:28:04.616 --> 01:28:05.617
What's happened?

01:28:06.034 --> 01:28:08.619
I've found romance.

01:28:09.037 --> 01:28:10.571
You have?

01:28:13.575 --> 01:28:15.576
Ellie!

01:28:15.577 --> 01:28:17.545
Ellie!

01:28:19.548 --> 01:28:22.551
Ellie! Ellie!

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.562
Chad...

01:28:35.063 --> 01:28:37.065
I just can't
keep it a secret.

01:28:41.069 --> 01:28:42.570
This is most unexpected.

01:28:42.571 --> 01:28:44.071
To me, too, Chad.

01:28:45.574 --> 01:28:46.574
Excuse me.

01:28:46.575 --> 01:28:48.075
Open up! Chad! Chad!

01:28:48.076 --> 01:28:50.578
Chad, Ellie's gone!
She stole the Jeep! What?

01:28:50.579 --> 01:28:52.079
She drove off
like a maniac!

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.081
Calm down!
Which way did she go?

01:28:54.082 --> 01:28:55.082
The front gate.

01:28:55.083 --> 01:28:56.584
Up the highway!

01:28:56.585 --> 01:28:59.587
That crazy kid.
I'll get a car and see if I can catch her.

01:28:59.588 --> 01:29:02.090
She went so fast,
we couldn't stop her.

01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:05.192
Ellie!

01:30:05.593 --> 01:30:06.694
Ellie!

01:30:11.699 --> 01:30:13.200
Ellie!

01:30:13.201 --> 01:30:15.202
Ellie!

01:30:15.203 --> 01:30:17.704
Oh! Oh!
Leave me alone! Let me go!

01:30:17.705 --> 01:30:19.206
Stop it, Ellie!

01:30:19.207 --> 01:30:21.208
I hate you!
Oh! Let me go!

01:30:21.209 --> 01:30:23.210
I'm trying
to help you!

01:30:23.211 --> 01:30:24.711
Oh! Let go!

01:30:24.712 --> 01:30:26.213
Let go of me!

01:30:26.714 --> 01:30:27.715
Stop it!

01:30:30.718 --> 01:30:32.219
Listen to me.

01:30:34.222 --> 01:30:36.223
Stop this!
Stop it!

01:30:36.224 --> 01:30:38.725
Why did you
have to stop me?

01:30:38.726 --> 01:30:40.727
Nobody cares about me...

01:30:40.728 --> 01:30:42.730
whether I live or die.

01:30:43.231 --> 01:30:46.234
Nobody seems to care because you
don't seem to care about yourself.

01:30:46.734 --> 01:30:47.734
You have to care first.

01:30:47.735 --> 01:30:50.237
If you like yourself,
others will, too.

01:30:50.238 --> 01:30:51.738
There's nothing
to like.

01:30:51.739 --> 01:30:54.741
There's a lot to like if you wouldn't
try to be something you're not.

01:30:54.742 --> 01:30:56.243
It don't work. I know.

01:30:56.744 --> 01:30:58.745
You better find out now

01:30:58.746 --> 01:31:00.747
and save yourself
a lot of grief.

01:31:00.748 --> 01:31:02.249
Everybody hates me.

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:03.750
Nobody hates you.

01:31:03.751 --> 01:31:05.752
No? Then why
do my parents

01:31:05.753 --> 01:31:07.754
always send me away...

01:31:07.755 --> 01:31:11.258
to school all year,
on trips every summer?

01:31:11.259 --> 01:31:13.260
And you...

01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:15.762
you threw me
out of your room.

01:31:15.763 --> 01:31:17.764
You didn't throw
Abigail out.

01:31:17.765 --> 01:31:19.766
You know
what you need?

01:31:19.767 --> 01:31:22.406
A good old-fashioned
spanking.

01:31:22.907 --> 01:31:24.408
M-maybe I do.

01:31:24.409 --> 01:31:27.911
Nobody ever cared enough
about me...

01:31:27.912 --> 01:31:29.413
even for that.

01:31:29.914 --> 01:31:30.914
All right, Eleanor.

01:31:30.915 --> 01:31:33.417
If that will prove that
somebody does care...

01:31:33.418 --> 01:31:34.918
you wouldn't dare!

01:31:34.919 --> 01:31:36.420
Wouldn't I dare?
Wouldn't I?

01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:37.421
Oww! Oww!

01:31:37.422 --> 01:31:39.423
I've got a feeling
this is going to

01:31:39.424 --> 01:31:41.425
make both of us feel
an awful lot better.

01:31:41.426 --> 01:31:42.926
Aah! Aah!

01:31:42.927 --> 01:31:44.428
Mmm, these hot cakes
are good.

01:31:44.429 --> 01:31:45.929
They're delicious.

01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:47.931
Ellie, pass the
guava jelly, please.

01:31:47.932 --> 01:31:48.932
Here, Bev.

01:31:49.934 --> 01:31:51.435
Gesundheit.

01:31:51.436 --> 01:31:53.937
That's a good way to see
how many friends you got...

01:31:53.938 --> 01:31:55.939
Sneeze, and then count
the gesundheits.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.942
Ellie, I hope you
didn't catch a head cold last night.

01:31:58.943 --> 01:32:02.946
No, ma'am.
Just the opposite.

01:32:02.947 --> 01:32:05.449
Maile, you haven't
touched your breakfast. Aren't you hungry?

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:07.951
I don't have much of
an appetite this morning.

01:32:07.952 --> 01:32:09.953
Oh? Are you feeling
all right?

01:32:09.954 --> 01:32:12.456
As a matter of fact,
I'm not, Miss Prentace.

01:32:12.457 --> 01:32:14.958
I didn't sleep
very well last night.

01:32:14.959 --> 01:32:16.960
I had rather
a restless night myself.

01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:18.962
Perhaps you should
get some rest

01:32:18.963 --> 01:32:20.965
instead of going
riding with us today.

01:32:22.467 --> 01:32:23.467
Maile!

01:32:23.468 --> 01:32:26.470
We'll meet out front
in 20 minutes, girls,

01:32:26.471 --> 01:32:27.971
and don't be late.

01:32:27.972 --> 01:32:29.973
Oh, we won't,
Miss Prentace.

01:32:29.974 --> 01:32:31.475
We'll be there.
We promise.

01:32:31.476 --> 01:32:34.478
Chad, I'd like
to talk to you.

01:32:34.479 --> 01:32:35.480
About last night?

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.982
Yes. I didn't get a chance to
finish what I was telling you.

01:32:38.983 --> 01:32:41.485
Miss Prentace,
I'm not the guy you think I am.

01:32:41.486 --> 01:32:42.986
I snore
and everything.

01:32:42.987 --> 01:32:44.988
Aloha!

01:32:44.989 --> 01:32:45.989
Jack!

01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:47.491
Jack!

01:32:48.493 --> 01:32:50.994
Abbie! I've been looking
all over for you.

01:32:50.995 --> 01:32:53.997
Hi, Chad. I didn't want
to disturb you last night.

01:32:53.998 --> 01:32:56.500
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

01:32:56.501 --> 01:32:58.001
You mean
you and Jack?

01:32:58.002 --> 01:32:59.002
Yes!

01:32:59.003 --> 01:33:01.004
Congratulations...
To both of you!

01:33:01.005 --> 01:33:02.005
Well, thanks.

01:33:02.006 --> 01:33:03.507
It's great.
It's just great.

01:33:03.508 --> 01:33:05.008
Look, fella,
I've got my girl.

01:33:05.009 --> 01:33:06.510
What I just saw of yours,

01:33:06.511 --> 01:33:07.512
I'd say you got a few things
to straighten out.

01:33:08.012 --> 01:33:09.012
Where did she go?

01:33:09.013 --> 01:33:12.516
Last time I saw her,
she was headed for her bungalow.

01:33:12.517 --> 01:33:14.017
Oh, I missed you.

01:33:14.018 --> 01:33:16.019
Just great.
You don't know how great it is.

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:17.521
Oh, he's a nice boy.

01:33:17.522 --> 01:33:19.523
I hope things
work out for him.

01:33:19.524 --> 01:33:22.025
He'll have to take care
of his girl himself.

01:33:22.026 --> 01:33:24.066
Maybe I can give him a hand
with his other problem.

01:33:24.529 --> 01:33:25.529
Come on.

01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:27.030
Operator.

01:33:27.031 --> 01:33:28.532
You look wonderful.

01:33:28.533 --> 01:33:31.535
Operator, get me
Mr. Fred Gates on Oahu.

01:33:31.536 --> 01:33:34.038
The Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.

01:33:42.046 --> 01:33:43.047
Hi, honey!

01:33:49.053 --> 01:33:51.555
You're in the wrong room,
lover boy.

01:33:51.556 --> 01:33:53.557
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

01:33:53.558 --> 01:33:55.058
I got tied up
with...

01:33:55.059 --> 01:33:57.060
With Miss Prentace!
I saw you.

01:33:57.061 --> 01:33:59.563
I could try to explain
what happened, Maile,

01:33:59.564 --> 01:34:01.565
but nobody would
believe me, not even me.

01:34:01.566 --> 01:34:03.567
Would you just believe
this? I love you.

01:34:03.568 --> 01:34:04.568
There's nothing between
Miss Prentace and me.

01:34:04.569 --> 01:34:06.570
Of course
you deny it,

01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:08.572
but I know that look,
and she's got it.

01:34:08.573 --> 01:34:11.575
That look is for Jack.
He's got it, too.

01:34:11.576 --> 01:34:14.578
Mr. Kelman
and Miss Prentace?

01:34:14.579 --> 01:34:16.580
Oh, you can do
better than that.

01:34:16.581 --> 01:34:18.582
You must think
I'm a fool!

01:34:18.583 --> 01:34:19.583
Look, Maile...

01:34:19.584 --> 01:34:22.085
Don't touch me!
Get out!

01:34:22.086 --> 01:34:23.587
Men...
You can have them!

01:34:23.588 --> 01:34:26.590
I don't want them!
Get out!

01:34:26.591 --> 01:34:28.092
I want you!

01:34:53.117 --> 01:34:54.618
Lonnie, 3 mai-tais.

01:34:54.619 --> 01:34:55.619
Yes, sir.

01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.121
Dad, what are you
doing here? Hello, son.

01:34:58.122 --> 01:35:01.125
I sent for him.
It's time you two got things settled.

01:35:01.626 --> 01:35:02.126
Settled?

01:35:02.627 --> 01:35:04.127
Sit down.

01:35:04.128 --> 01:35:07.131
Do you mean to say that you dragged
me all the way over here just...

01:35:07.632 --> 01:35:09.132
What are you
doing here anyway?

01:35:09.133 --> 01:35:10.634
I'm here
on business.

01:35:10.635 --> 01:35:12.135
Well, that's
a welcome change.

01:35:12.136 --> 01:35:13.637
What kind
of business?

01:35:13.638 --> 01:35:15.639
Dad, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.641
You and mother wanted me
to work for the company.

01:35:17.642 --> 01:35:19.142
Do you still want it?

01:35:19.143 --> 01:35:21.645
Yes. Your mother and I
both want that very much.

01:35:21.646 --> 01:35:23.146
And you, Jack?

01:35:23.147 --> 01:35:24.648
Nothing would
suit me better.

01:35:24.649 --> 01:35:26.650
That leaves me.
What do I want?

01:35:26.651 --> 01:35:28.151
I want independence,

01:35:28.152 --> 01:35:30.153
a chance to prove
I can stand on my own...

01:35:30.154 --> 01:35:32.656
which seems to rule out
working for the company.

01:35:32.657 --> 01:35:35.159
But I think I figured
a way to do both...

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.662
work for the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company

01:35:38.162 --> 01:35:39.163
and Chad Gates.

01:35:39.664 --> 01:35:41.164
How many salesmen
you have, Jack?

01:35:41.165 --> 01:35:43.166
- Oh, I don't know.
- 317.

01:35:43.167 --> 01:35:45.669
- Scattered all over the states, right?
- And Canada.

01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:48.171
Every year, you have
your annual sales meeting in Atlanta.

01:35:48.172 --> 01:35:49.673
- They all come, don't they?
- Most all.

01:35:50.174 --> 01:35:52.175
Have you ever thought
of how much

01:35:52.176 --> 01:35:53.677
they would look forward
to a trip to Hawaii?

01:35:53.678 --> 01:35:54.958
You could bring them
over here,

01:35:55.179 --> 01:35:57.180
show them how we grow
the fruit, process it,

01:35:57.181 --> 01:35:59.182
let them get a firsthand
taste of Hawaiian sunshine,

01:35:59.183 --> 01:36:00.184
and they'd go back
to their territories

01:36:00.685 --> 01:36:02.185
and sell like
they never sold before.

01:36:02.186 --> 01:36:03.706
Fred, I think the
boy's got something.

01:36:04.188 --> 01:36:05.689
And also special
incentive trips.

01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:07.190
Any salesman
who goes over his quota

01:36:07.191 --> 01:36:09.693
gets a week's holiday here,
all expenses paid.

01:36:09.694 --> 01:36:11.195
Why, that's a
crackerjack notion.

01:36:11.696 --> 01:36:13.196
I'll put you
in charge of the whole program.

01:36:13.197 --> 01:36:14.197
I don't want that, Jack.

01:36:14.198 --> 01:36:16.199
I want to go in business
for myself with Maile.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.201
That's my declaration
of independence.

01:36:18.202 --> 01:36:19.703
I wondered where
I fit into this.

01:36:19.704 --> 01:36:22.205
- Maile, sit down.
- Hello, Maile.

01:36:22.206 --> 01:36:24.207
I'm giving great
Southern this idea.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:26.209
I expect them to give us
the tourist business.

01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:28.211
My partner will
figure out the costs

01:36:28.212 --> 01:36:30.714
and draw up a program
for your approval, ok?

01:36:30.715 --> 01:36:32.215
You've got a deal.

01:36:32.216 --> 01:36:35.185
Chad,
I'm proud of you.

01:36:35.186 --> 01:36:38.221
Lonnie, 4 of those little
tummy-warmers over here.

01:36:38.222 --> 01:36:39.222
Yes, sir.

01:36:39.223 --> 01:36:40.724
How do you feel,
partner?

01:36:40.725 --> 01:36:42.225
Proud and happy.

01:36:42.226 --> 01:36:44.227
"Gates and Duval
Travel Service."

01:36:44.228 --> 01:36:46.229
has a nice ring
to it.

01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:48.732
It's too long. Simple.
"Gates of Hawaii."

01:36:48.733 --> 01:36:50.233
Don't I get
any billing?

01:36:50.234 --> 01:36:51.735
Sure. Gates is plural.

01:36:51.736 --> 01:36:54.738
In case you didn't
recognize it, that's a proposal,

01:36:54.739 --> 01:36:56.239
and that has
a better ring.

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:57.741
You're sure?

01:36:57.742 --> 01:37:00.243
I suppose I could be
romantic about it,

01:37:00.244 --> 01:37:02.245
but you'd say yes
anyway.

01:37:02.246 --> 01:37:03.747
You're pretty sure
of yourself.

01:37:03.748 --> 01:37:05.249
Isn't it about time?

01:37:06.751 --> 01:37:07.752
Missa. Missa Gate.

01:37:08.252 --> 01:37:09.252
Uh, Mr. Gate...

01:37:09.253 --> 01:37:10.754
Mr. Gate on line
for you.

01:37:11.255 --> 01:37:13.257
Oh, <i>merci beaucoup,</i>
<i>Ping Pong.</i>

01:37:14.759 --> 01:37:17.260
Hello? Hello, daddy?

01:37:17.261 --> 01:37:18.762
Sarah Lee,
pack your things.

01:37:18.763 --> 01:37:20.263
You're coming over
to Kauai.

01:37:20.264 --> 01:37:22.766
Kauai?
What on earth for?

01:37:22.767 --> 01:37:24.769
Don't argue with me,
Sarah Lee!

01:37:25.269 --> 01:37:26.770
You better hurry
over here,

01:37:27.271 --> 01:37:29.273
or you'll miss
your son's wedding.

01:37:29.774 --> 01:37:31.275
Hello?

01:37:31.776 --> 01:37:32.777
Hello?

01:37:33.277 --> 01:37:34.278
Hello?

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.281
Everything ok, Mr. Gate.

01:37:38.282 --> 01:37:41.285
Missa Gate just taking nap,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

01:37:45.289 --> 01:37:46.790
And did you know

01:37:46.791 --> 01:37:49.292
that my daughter-in-law
is of royal blood?

01:37:49.293 --> 01:37:50.794
She's the direct
descendant

01:37:50.795 --> 01:37:52.796
of King Kalaniopoopoo
of Hawaii.

01:37:52.797 --> 01:37:53.797
Kalaneaupuhuu.

01:37:53.798 --> 01:37:54.798
Uh, yes.

01:37:54.799 --> 01:37:56.800
Our southernmost
island, you know.

01:37:56.801 --> 01:37:58.802
Yes, I know. I am
her grandmother.

01:37:58.803 --> 01:37:59.803
Uh, yes.

01:37:59.804 --> 01:38:02.305
