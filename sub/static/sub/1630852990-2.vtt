WEBVTT

00:12.303 --> 00:14.514
Andy, don't talk to them.

00:14.597 --> 00:15.557
Who?

00:15.640 --> 00:16.516
The police.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.059
That was something,

00:18.143 --> 00:19.436
<i>what your mom did.</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:23.064
- He doesn't want your money.
- Paula Kunde…

00:24.983 --> 00:26.901
Give me his phone.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.863
<i>His car will be around here.</i>
<i>You're gonna drive to Carrollton.</i>

00:29.946 --> 00:31.448
There's a storage place, Get-Em-Go.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.909
<i>I have a car there. Take it</i>
<i>and head north, all the way to Maine.</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:37.245
<i>Find a motel in Camden</i>
<i>and just stay there.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:59.184
<i>I'm cold.</i>

01:02.979 --> 01:04.189
<i>Is it snowing?</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:13.114
<i>- Oh, he's coming back. He's coming back.</i>

01:23.124 --> 01:24.042
Holy shit!

02:00.870 --> 02:02.080
$17.39.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.127
I only need one of these.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.045
Oh, right.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.638
- Miss, your change.
- Oh.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.901
Fuck.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.914
Excuse me? Uh, you know
how to get to Get-Em-Go?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.249
"Get-Em" what?

04:10.708 --> 04:11.542
Never mind.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.089
<i>Shepard needs</i>
<i>a progressive democrat</i>

04:16.172 --> 04:18.633
<i>that cares about issues</i>
<i>like climate change</i>

04:18.716 --> 04:20.468
<i>without alienating centrist voters</i>

04:20.551 --> 04:22.887
<i>who may be skeptical</i>
<i>about a female candidate</i>

04:22.971 --> 04:25.682
<i>Mm. Are we</i>
<i>still having that conversation?</i>

04:25.765 --> 04:29.769
<i>Shepard doesn't carry</i>
<i>the same baggage Hillary Clinton did.</i>

04:30.270 --> 04:33.606
<i>But her … choice could tip the scales</i>
<i>one way or the other.</i>

04:33.690 --> 04:34.899
<i>And speaking of baggage,</i>

04:34.983 --> 04:37.610
<i>doesn't Jasper Queller</i>
<i>have more than his share?</i>

04:37.694 --> 04:40.613
<i>Maybe, but he does well</i>
<i>with female voters.</i>

06:22.673 --> 06:25.468
- Paula was right about you.
- Paula Koontz--

06:54.956 --> 06:56.958
Thanks for
talking with us, Ms. Oliver.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.376
Oh, no, of course.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.129
We were hoping to speak
with your daughter as well.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.382
Uh, Andy's gone up
to see friends in Atlanta.

07:04.465 --> 07:08.010
- She's a bit, um… overwhelmed by all this.
- Mm.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.431
You had a bit
of a scare yourself last night.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.558
I understand the police
were called to the house?

07:13.641 --> 07:16.436
Yeah, I feel terrible about this.
Um…

07:16.519 --> 07:20.273
I'm pretty keyed up. And, uh,
I woke up in the middle of the night.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.191
Thought I saw someone outside.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.777
By the time the police got here,
no one was there.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.322
- They were very nice about it.
- Your text said that the man was armed.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.324
If you didn't see anyone, how did you…

07:30.408 --> 07:34.537
No, I know. I guess
I'm just seeing guns everywhere.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.832
It's understandable
after what you went through.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.879
Could you walk us through
what happened yesterday?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.298
Sure, it's a little blurry, but, um…

07:45.381 --> 07:47.467
Andrea and I went for lunch.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.970
We were talking

07:51.053 --> 07:55.224
and, um… Betsy and her daughter came over.

07:57.602 --> 08:02.440
And, uh… all of a sudden,
there were, there were gunshots.

08:02.523 --> 08:07.320
And I remember… seeing a lot of blood.

08:07.403 --> 08:11.365
And, uh… that young man.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.658
It's Jonah Helsinger.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.329
He was so focused on Andy.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.496
I remember thinking,

08:18.789 --> 08:20.166
"God, he's gonna kill her."

08:21.083 --> 08:23.419
And I, I just reacted.

08:25.588 --> 08:29.842
I would call it an unusual reaction.
There was a knife lodged in your hand.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.802
Yeah, well, I…

08:31.886 --> 08:33.721
I do have an old injury, which, um…

08:34.764 --> 08:37.433
Which means
there's not much feeling there, but, yeah.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.394
Most of the other people
in the diner

08:40.478 --> 08:42.396
were hiding under tables, but not you.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.446
Do you have children, Detective Wilson?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.115
No, I don't.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.285
If someone threatens your child,

08:57.954 --> 08:59.830
you do anything to protect them.

09:01.832 --> 09:02.792
Something just

09:04.293 --> 09:05.127
kicks in.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.094
I think that's all we need.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.432
You are a very brave woman.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.979
I guess we never really know
what we're capable of.

09:23.062 --> 09:23.938
I guess not.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.535
- Are those your keys?
- Sorry?

09:37.618 --> 09:39.620
Your car is still at the diner, right?

09:39.704 --> 09:40.538
Yeah.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.082
Happy to have
a couple of officers drop it off.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.543
You shouldn't be driving right now.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.670
- That'd be wonderful, thank you.
- All right.

09:49.714 --> 09:54.218
You know, um, I hate to bother
my neighbors with all this commotion.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.221
Do you think you could ask the reporters
to move farther down the block?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.389
No problem.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.682
Hey. Is Andy with you?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.684
- <i>She's fine.</i>
<i>- She</i> never showed up.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.102
Figured she crashed out.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.772
<i>She's, uh… some place safe.</i>

10:49.273 --> 10:50.358
"Some place safe"?

10:50.941 --> 10:52.610
<i>Can you please come over?</i>

10:55.404 --> 10:58.991
- What's going on?
<i>- As soon as you can. Please?</i>

11:00.743 --> 11:01.786
I'm on my way.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.254
Hi. I, uh, sent something to the printer?

11:17.802 --> 11:19.428
That'll be $2, dear.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.139
"The way life should be."

11:22.932 --> 11:23.766
What?

11:23.849 --> 11:26.394
Maine. That's the State slogan.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.897
I've heard it's beautiful
this time of year.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.066
Sure beats this humidity, I'll tell ya.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.668
What the…

16:18.268 --> 16:19.395
Oh, my God.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.261
Is this okay? The water okay?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.470
Mm, it's fine.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.560
Okay.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.276
How'd you get this one, again?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.405
I was bike-riding with my mother.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.993
And… I went downhill too fast,
and the thing went out from under me.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.828
At least I come by it honestly.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.621
What?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.291
My complete lack of physical coordination.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.668
That's not true. You've got volleyball.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.629
Mr. Chapman said
I look like a drunk meerkat.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.425
Don't make me laugh, it hurts.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.607
Thanks for coming.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.904
What's going on?

18:33.987 --> 18:34.988
Where's Andy?

18:36.031 --> 18:39.284
She's, uh… She's on her way to Maine.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.202
Why?

18:40.953 --> 18:41.870
Okay, listen.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.666
Last night a man broke into the house…

18:45.749 --> 18:47.292
- What?
- …and tried to hurt me.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.211
- Laura, what the hell?
- Yeah, I know.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.548
- Andy stopped him. She--
- Wait. Slow down. What happened?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.507
And is she okay?

18:53.590 --> 18:56.301
Yeah, but it's just not safe
for her to be here.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.220
They know where I am now.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.642
- He's here.
- Who?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.313
Laura, who's here?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.292
- I'm calling 911.
- We don't have time.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.251
What do you mean?

19:29.334 --> 19:32.379
He's supposed to meet someone outside
Macon at three o'clock to get paid.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.047
- So, if we take him there--
- No.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.384
We can see who shows up
and get a photo and a license plate,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.887
- then drop him at a hospital--
- I'm not gonna do this.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.933
- Gordon. Gordon, wait. Wait.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.976
What? What?

19:49.229 --> 19:51.565
You knew someone
might come looking for me.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.233
This was always part of the deal.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.444
Okay, listen, Laura. We can call the feds.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.820
- You'll be given immunity!
- No.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.864
By that time,
whoever he's meeting will be long gone.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.826
Do you know how this looks?
Think about it. Me driving him.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.125
Fuck.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.753
It's just, they won't stop.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.090
I mean, they'll go after Andy.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.638
I tried. Oh, my God.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.515
I fucking tried so hard
to keep both of you out of this.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.353
I can't just sit here
and do nothing, you know?

20:30.270 --> 20:33.398
I don't want Andy having to look
over her shoulder the rest of her life.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.447
We're not married anymore.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.887
Can I help you?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.222
I need a room.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.351
Yeah, $39.99 for a standard
and $45.99 for a river view.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.396
I'll take one facing the parking lot.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.399
Sign here.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.152
- Oh, God.
- What's happening?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.987
- What's happening?
- He's having a seizure.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.615
- Jesus. How bad is it?
- I don't know.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.700
- Is he breathing?
- I don't know!

23:30.784 --> 23:32.452
Hey. Hey. Hey.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.205
We need to find a hospital.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.040
Oh, God.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.214
Hey. Hey, listen to me.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.843
I need the number of the man who sent you.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.809
He's gonna kill you.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.073
Oh, no.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.379
Fuck!

25:00.165 --> 25:02.334
Why didn't you ever tell me
how bad it was?

25:05.212 --> 25:06.838
I mean, it never made sense.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.966
That you were still afraid
after all those years. But--

25:10.050 --> 25:11.968
You think it would have made a difference?

25:19.559 --> 25:21.061
Why do they want to hurt you?

25:24.064 --> 25:24.898
Not they.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.026
Just one person.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.448
I have to find a way to reach him.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.449
To make this stop.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.834
We gotta get going, Laura.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.589
I'll drive you to Pembroke.
Catch a cab from there.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.842
You can't help me put him in the ground.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.429
Oh, Gordon.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.639
This never happened.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.205
<i>No one ever stops him.</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:25.166
<i>I'm afraid of him.</i>

26:26.835 --> 26:29.462
<i>He'll take her from me.</i>
<i>He takes everything.</i>

26:54.112 --> 26:56.031
- Oh, Charlie.
- Hi.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.199
- Ms. Oliver, a few questions?
- No comment.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.826
- It won't take long.
- Hey!

26:59.909 --> 27:02.704
Hey. Hey. Back off.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.041
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.672
Let's get you inside.

27:12.756 --> 27:16.009
Oh, I need some air.
You want to sit with me?

27:19.512 --> 27:21.056
How long were you waiting?

27:21.139 --> 27:22.724
About an hour and a half.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.519
I saw your car,
but nobody's answering the door.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.689
Yeah, I had physical therapy.
Gordon drove me.

27:31.107 --> 27:31.941
Gordon.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.945
- You two back together?

27:36.029 --> 27:38.448
No. Nothing like that.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.743
- You'd tell me?
- Of course.

27:45.288 --> 27:49.209
I was down in The Keys.
I came straight back when I saw the news.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.045
I know. It just… happened.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.923
I didn't expect it to become this thing.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.346
You know, I don't like
the idea of losing you.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.602
I'm still here.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.108
Where's Andy?

28:13.650 --> 28:15.068
Visiting friends.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.907
You know, you shouldn't be alone.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.495
If you want to get away
from all of this, we can do that.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.044
Charlie.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.630
I'm okay.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.134
Just tired.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.512
Can we talk tomorrow?

28:45.640 --> 28:46.474
Yeah.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.226
Okay.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.270
I'll call you.

28:51.479 --> 28:52.313
Yeah.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.663
Shit.

29:53.374 --> 29:58.630
<i>You're not seeing things clearly.</i>
<i>And reality's complicated.</i>

29:59.964 --> 30:02.008
<i>We simply have to decide how much--</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:04.385
<i>How much a human life is worth.</i>

31:28.761 --> 31:29.596
No!

31:45.028 --> 31:46.863
You guys ready for another?

32:01.085 --> 32:03.129
- What can I get you?
- Uh, some fries please.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.631
And a double vodka rocks.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.937
- Fries'll be out in a minute.
- Thanks.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.719
You're that girl, huh?

32:51.803 --> 32:53.721
- No.
- So, what was it like?

32:54.430 --> 32:58.059
- Hey, could I get those fries to go?
- How'd your mom even do that, anyway?

32:58.142 --> 32:59.310
She's not my mom.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.482
Tell me I'm crazy.

33:06.734 --> 33:07.985
Same girl, sitting right here.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.028
I don't know.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.656
- Come on, plain as day.
- All right, Captain Morgan.

33:14.033 --> 33:16.494
The girl in the photo's a lot younger,
looks nothing like her.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.704
Yeah. Screw you.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.374
I'll get your change.

33:21.916 --> 33:22.750
Thanks.

33:23.459 --> 33:24.460
For what?

33:24.544 --> 33:26.546
Right.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.217
It'd suck to be that girl.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.137
To be paralyzed with fear
while your mom saves your ass.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.975
You'd drink yourself stupid.

33:45.023 --> 33:45.982
You okay?

33:49.235 --> 33:51.904
You ever have that thing
where you think you know someone,

33:51.988 --> 33:54.991
as well as you could
possibly know anyone, and then,

33:56.159 --> 34:00.163
one day, it's just clear as day,
you were totally fucking wrong?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.834
I felt that same way about Santa Claus.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.802
Uh, sorry, could I have another,
and whatever he's drinking?

34:14.886 --> 34:17.138
No. I'm gonna get going.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.098
- Thank you, though.
- Oh, come on.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.313
Here's to…

34:28.024 --> 34:29.317
Being wrong about people.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.582
I'm Andy.

34:46.876 --> 34:47.877
Jack.

34:48.669 --> 34:49.879
You're from around here?

34:50.671 --> 34:53.382
Up the road a bit. You passing through?

34:53.466 --> 34:54.842
Yeah, headed north.

34:55.802 --> 34:58.137
Might be coming around
to this place, though.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.388
The scenery's not so bad.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.143
Sorry.

35:05.686 --> 35:06.854
Sorry, I, um…

35:06.938 --> 35:09.899
Sometimes, I just say things.
They just come out.

35:15.571 --> 35:18.825
You know, this is the part
where you say, "That's okay, I get it."

35:18.908 --> 35:22.161
"I've had shitty days too." And, I say…

35:22.245 --> 35:25.206
Right. Sure. <i>That's</i> what I say?

35:26.833 --> 35:27.917
Something like that.

35:29.585 --> 35:30.711
Okay.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.381
I've had a shitty day or two.

35:37.677 --> 35:38.511
I need more.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.556
All right.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.894
Buddy and I had a bet going in boot camp,

35:46.978 --> 35:49.522
which one of us would win
the marksman prize.

35:50.523 --> 35:54.068
We used to bike out to the desert
for practice, until one morning,

35:54.152 --> 35:58.573
I hit a rock, spin out,
fuck the bike and my knee.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.201
A month later,
my unit shipped out to Iraq,

36:02.285 --> 36:04.245
and I'm pushing paper in Twentynine Palms.

36:06.539 --> 36:07.373
Hoorah.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.544
So, you know how to handle a gun?

36:13.880 --> 36:14.714
Teach me.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.383
- What?
- I'm serious.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.969
Are you expecting
more trouble or something?

36:21.512 --> 36:22.346
Please?

36:24.056 --> 36:24.891
No way.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.935
Besides, it's not like I got one on me.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.020
Well, I do.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.439
I got it today.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.066
I wanted to feel safe, you know?

36:37.612 --> 36:38.446
Please.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.031
Help me out.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.414
Now you.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.876
Walk me through one?

36:54.670 --> 36:56.547
Square yourself off with your target.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.091
Feet shoulder-width apart.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.594
Just bring that right leg back slightly.

37:03.804 --> 37:04.639
Like this?

37:07.850 --> 37:08.684
Can I?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.772
All right, relax your shoulders.

37:12.855 --> 37:13.689
That's right.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.317
Keep your elbows bent. Grip it tight.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.113
Now, all you wanna see
over your front sights is your target.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.202
And when you're ready,
I want you to squeeze the trigger.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.788
But just do it slowly, okay?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.240
I'm ready to make a statement now.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.493
But I need you to air the whole thing,
whatever I say, no edits.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.120
Okay.

38:51.203 --> 38:54.040
I need it to go national.
I want everyone to see it.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.960
How about an interview
on <i>The Today Show</i> tomorrow morning?

38:59.462 --> 39:00.337
Okay.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.411
You know it was beginner's luck, right?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.080
Come on, I'm a natural.

39:34.163 --> 39:34.997
Mm.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.166
I see some promise.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.837
That's what everyone says.
It's my follow-through that needs work.

39:41.921 --> 39:42.922
Mm.

39:46.884 --> 39:47.718
This is me.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.062
I should head home.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.482
Right. Okay.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.236
Unless, you want a lift.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.530
I'm, uh…

40:08.739 --> 40:10.324
I'm just across the road. So…

40:16.080 --> 40:18.541
Thanks for, um… you know.

40:22.002 --> 40:23.129
No problem.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.383
Just, uh, do me a favor?

40:28.134 --> 40:30.219
Remember not to lock your elbows, huh?

40:30.803 --> 40:32.096
And the knees too.

40:39.353 --> 40:40.521
- Whoa.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.358
You okay?

40:45.109 --> 40:46.068
Yeah.

40:48.195 --> 40:51.115
- I'll walk you back.
- Oh, no, no, no. No, it's fine.

40:51.198 --> 40:52.533
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:57.872 --> 40:58.706
Good night!
