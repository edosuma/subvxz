WEBVTT

01:28.296 --> 01:29.839
Transcription is the process by which?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.300
-DNA is copied to create mRNA.
-MR.Yes.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.345
The measure of one interior angle
of a regular decagon is?

01:35.428 --> 01:37.847
-144 degrees.
-Correct.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.224
Lily, you're on <i>fuego.</i>

01:39.307 --> 01:40.517
MR.Keep it up.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.478
-We are going to crush at regionals.

01:43.561 --> 01:44.479
This is our year.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.148
Hamton High is going down so hard.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.983
We have them beat in... in History,

01:49.067 --> 01:51.027
in Literature, in Math,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.278
it's almost...

01:53.905 --> 01:55.615
not fair.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.145
You ever get tired of it?

02:25.645 --> 02:26.646
Of what?

02:26.729 --> 02:27.730
Winning?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.191
Being a nerd?

02:30.275 --> 02:35.822
Uh, Melinda Gates, RBG, Angela Merkel.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.407
Nerdy girls rule the world.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.952
Yeah, but just once, I want someone
to look at me and think, like,

02:41.035 --> 02:43.246
"Wow, she's so freaking hot."

02:43.329 --> 02:46.249
Instead of,
"Wow, she's so frickin' smart."

02:46.332 --> 02:48.209
You know, like, just once,

02:48.293 --> 02:51.921
I wanna get invited to a party
that's not at a teacher's house.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.175
I want that.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.427
And, of course,
she's talking to Ben.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.972
Didn't you tutor him once?

03:01.556 --> 03:02.682
Eighth-grade algebra.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.684
Best hour of my life.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.477
Not that he remembers.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.314
Why would he when he has Ms. Perfect?

03:09.814 --> 03:11.524
Nobody's perfect, Lil.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.693
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.446
Just... wish I could be, like,
a little closer to it.

03:35.089 --> 03:35.965
Whoa.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.343
Is that our sub?

03:38.927 --> 03:40.261
MS.Put the books away.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.640
We're gonna try a new approach
to art class today.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.434
We're actually gonna paint something.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.561
Crazy, right?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.355
-Excuse me?

03:51.147 --> 03:52.482
What are we gonna paint?

03:54.525 --> 03:55.818
And you are?

03:56.402 --> 03:57.362
Lily.

03:57.445 --> 04:01.741
Well, Lily, the thing about art
is it can be whatever you want.

04:01.824 --> 04:05.912
Haven't you ever heard the phrase,
"beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?

04:06.746 --> 04:08.456
-<i>My house after school?</i>

04:08.539 --> 04:09.374
Pizza and practice?

04:09.457 --> 04:11.292
Okay, but we're getting olives.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.377
No way...

04:12.460 --> 04:13.461
You promised.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.088
No, no. It's Ben.
He's walking towards you.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.339
-What? What?
-Just be cool.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.674
Hey, Tutor Girl.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.925
Ah...

04:19.008 --> 04:20.009
You remember.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.887
Yeah, uh, eighth-grade algebra.
How could I forget?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.555
-So, um...

04:24.639 --> 04:25.932
if you're busy, I totally get it.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.769
But I'm having a party,
and I was wondering...

04:30.979 --> 04:34.899
My dad is gonna make me call it off
if I don't ace this geometry quiz.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.361
So do you think you could, like, tutor me?

04:39.862 --> 04:41.656
I get it, it's... it's last minute.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.992
Yeah, I, I would be happy to.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.661
-Should I come over or...

04:46.744 --> 04:47.954
You don't have to. Uh...

04:48.037 --> 04:49.831
I'll just email you my questions.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.708
You're in the school directory, right?

04:51.791 --> 04:52.750
Uh-huh.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.377
Uh, you're saving my life.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.878
I owe you big time.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.803
Boys are dumb, Lil.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.307
I will see you in study hall, okay?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.939
-Pretty girls have problems too.

05:15.940 --> 05:16.983
Uh...

05:18.109 --> 05:21.195
Yeah, I... well,
I'd kill to have Harper's problems.

05:21.279 --> 05:25.158
Believe it or not, once upon a time,
I was an awkward 15-year-old.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.911
Had a face full of acne
and the unibrow struggle was real.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.790
-No way. You're... you know, you're...

05:32.874 --> 05:35.376
Growing up is tough for everyone.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.587
Give it a few years. You'll blossom.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.672
Few years, right.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.091
Well, see you around, Lily.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.013
Can you keep a secret?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.139
What?

05:48.222 --> 05:50.975
What if I told you
there is a way to skip the years,

05:51.059 --> 05:55.480
transform yourself into something
that will make Harper look basic?

05:55.563 --> 05:58.232
-I mean, I'd say, yes, please.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.862
A beauty app?

06:02.945 --> 06:05.656
Yeah, I've used those.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.325
It's not just any beauty app.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.953
It's strictly invite-only,
and I promise you, it works.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.789
Look at me, I'm living proof.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.165
Give it a try.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.709
But don't tell anyone
or you'll lose your edge.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.669
It'll be our little secret.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.232
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.733
Well, hang on. What's with the mask?

07:22.817 --> 07:26.487
The air quality index said
unhealthy for sensitive groups.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.072
Did you change your hair?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.283
I'm running late, gotta go!

07:57.602 --> 07:59.520
Hey, Carm.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.606
Hey, what happened to you this weekend?

08:01.689 --> 08:03.065
You never return...

08:04.275 --> 08:05.318
Oh...

08:05.401 --> 08:06.569
What?

08:06.652 --> 08:07.987
-Can you believe it?

08:08.070 --> 08:10.490
My parents finally caved
and let me get a nose job.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.992
-And it's healed already?
-Uh.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.621
Yes. Surgical advancements
these days are, like, whoa.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.790
You don't... You don't like it?

08:19.874 --> 08:23.211
No, no. You look amazing.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.546
Beauty and brains, I'm here for it.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.548
-Hey, Mae Jemison.

08:27.632 --> 08:32.011
She's a total babe
and a total brainiac, right?

08:32.094 --> 08:33.846
Yeah. Yeah.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.474
Her song lyrics are, like, so deep.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.434
Song lyrics?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.895
Mae Jemison, the astronaut.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.189
The one you idolize,

08:43.272 --> 08:46.484
and you wrote that brilliant essay
about her last semester?

08:47.276 --> 08:49.362
Oh, you said Mae Jemison.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.655
Mm-hm.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.116
Sorry. It's, like, it's so loud in here.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.826
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.047
Are you coming?

09:10.633 --> 09:11.842
Yeah.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.346
-Let's go.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.765
Okay, easy one.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.643
Pepin the Short was the first member
of which Frankish noble family

09:20.726 --> 09:21.852
to become king?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.440
Uh, you know, Carm,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.902
we don't need to be prepping
for Quiz Bowl every second of the day.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.404
Crazy idea.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.657
How about we talk like humans instead?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.327
Oh, wait. You said like humans.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.870
-Lily!

09:39.954 --> 09:41.247
Lily, wait up.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.626
We were just talking about your brows.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.503
-You were?
-They're beyond.

09:48.087 --> 09:48.963
What's your secret?

09:49.046 --> 09:51.632
I, I don't have a secret.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.219
I just, um, get, like, a vision,

09:55.303 --> 09:58.139
and then, I try to match that vision.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.016
-- And that highlighter.
-- Heaven's Hue, right?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.392
Looks amazing on you.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.185
Thanks.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.438
If you ever wanna trade tips,
we're here for it.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.441
We actually have some time now
if you're not busy.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.487
Uh, well, we act...

10:13.571 --> 10:17.491
We, we actually had a plan
to study for the Quiz Bowl.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.912
It's not the end of the world
if we skip a day.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.415
Yeah.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.250
Yeah, yeah, right.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.127
Okay. You're the best. Love ya.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.586
-MRS.Dinner's ready.
-Busy.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.712
MRS.Lily, come on.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.173
Your dad and I feel like
you've been avoiding us for days.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.676
Yeah, it's because I have, like,
a ton of work to do.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.968
I'll eat later.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.474
So, I'm not supposed to say anything,
but someone stans you.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.184
Really?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.352
He's a total snack.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.020
Level five thirst trap.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.980
And he's on the soccer team.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.859
It's Ryan Moscowitz.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.028
Oh.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.949
It's just that, um...

11:40.700 --> 11:42.326
there's someone else.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.829
Who is it?

11:44.912 --> 11:46.580
-Spill.
-I mean, it doesn't matter.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.624
He's, like, way out of my league.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.501
-Maybe not.
-You look amazing.

11:58.759 --> 11:59.760
Ben?

12:00.594 --> 12:04.348
Yeah, well, the thing is,
him and me, we're kind of...

12:04.432 --> 12:06.767
Oh! I know, I know.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.186
I, I was just kidding.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.232
You just have to keep your expectations...

12:13.315 --> 12:15.443
a little more realistic, Lily.

12:19.864 --> 12:24.201
"You just have to keep your expectations
a little more realistic, Lily."

12:25.578 --> 12:26.620
Okay, Ben.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.290
Say goodbye to Tutor Girl.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.466
MR.Lily?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.593
Where are you off to
so early on a Saturday?

12:40.676 --> 12:43.763
I have some stuff to do.
I'll see you at Quiz Bowl.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.890
Wait, I, I thought
we were all going together?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.518
Lily, can you please look at us
when we're talking to you?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.524
-What in the world?
-Oh, my God.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.734
-MRS.What did you do?
-How did you pay for that?

12:56.817 --> 12:57.693
How did this happen?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.862
Oh, my God. Dramatic much?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.614
-MRS.What...
-It's just a makeover.

13:01.697 --> 13:05.743
If, if you think we're letting you leave
this house looking like that...

13:05.826 --> 13:08.370
Okay, I get good grades.
I'm home by curfew.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.706
I just wanna feel good about myself.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.042
Why can't you let me be happy?

13:13.125 --> 13:15.002
Of course, we want you to be happy but...

13:15.085 --> 13:16.712
-you don't look like you.
-MRS.No.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.755
Exactly.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.882
That girl was a loser.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.635
This girl gets what she wants.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.428
MRS.Lily, wait.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.238
-Lily?
-Like the look?

13:43.447 --> 13:45.783
Welcome to the semi-finals.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.077
We'll begin with the speed round.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.579
Radley High Team Rep, you're up first.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.791
And your 60 seconds begins... now.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.919
"What led to the collapse
of the Han Dynasty?"

13:57.002 --> 13:58.629
Kylo Ren?

13:58.712 --> 13:59.755
-Uh...

13:59.839 --> 14:01.173
That, that is incorrect.

14:01.257 --> 14:05.094
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"
was famously penned by?

14:05.678 --> 14:09.014
A yellow wood... nellow, yellow, yellow,

14:09.098 --> 14:11.433
yellow, yellow brick road, yeah...

14:13.769 --> 14:15.062
Dorothy.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.523
-Incorrect.

14:17.606 --> 14:22.903
"This Italian tower began its slant
in the 12th century."

14:23.612 --> 14:25.739
Uh, the Tower of...

14:30.244 --> 14:31.203
Terror.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.664
-Time-out. Substitution.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.961
Hey, uh, what happened back there?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.629
Chill, we still won.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.172
Barely.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.425
You need to get it together
before the finals tomorrow.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.093
It's not like anybody cares,

14:46.176 --> 14:47.845
it's just Nerd Bowl.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.138
I gotta catch the game.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.723
Uh, we have the team dinner.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.516
And you hate soccer.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.353
Yeah, but Ben and I
are kind of vibing, so...

14:56.437 --> 14:58.856
Oh, is he vibing with you?

14:58.939 --> 15:01.025
Or with whatever that is?

15:01.775 --> 15:05.321
"Whatever that is"
is getting thousands of likes, so...

15:06.155 --> 15:08.449
What is wrong with you, Lily?

15:08.532 --> 15:09.783
Nothing.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.121
You know, Carm,
you could use a glow-up yourself.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.540
No, thanks.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.083
Ever since your glow-up,

15:18.167 --> 15:20.336
all you care about
is sitting with the cool kids

15:20.419 --> 15:21.670
and perfecting your duck face.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.465
Aw, I get it. You're jelly.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.052
You're so basic.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.387
Lily.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.057
Okay, let's just skip the lecture, please.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.308
How about this, then?

15:34.391 --> 15:35.935
You're off the team.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.730
MS.Ugh.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.649
So much for gratitude.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.319
They wouldn't even be
in the finals without you.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.197
Did he really just kick me off the team?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.783
Some people can't stand
the sight of a butterfly.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.993
They'd have you stay
a caterpillar forever.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.704
Don't let anyone make you feel bad
about spreading your wings

15:55.788 --> 15:57.331
and taking what's yours.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.917
Lily, hey.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.503
I passed the quiz, so party's on.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.046
You're coming, right?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.006
Totes.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.217
Cool. See you then.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.429
Take what's yours, Lily.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.776
Lily, you made it.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.030
This is... so lit.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.825
Right, um, here, come on,
I'll show you around.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.521
So... you're, like, a serious baller.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.981
Uh...

17:04.064 --> 17:05.941
I don't know about that but...

17:06.025 --> 17:08.527
it's cool to have, like,
a stress outlet, you know?

17:08.610 --> 17:10.696
Things have been kind of...

17:11.321 --> 17:12.656
hectic since my parents split up.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.451
Oh, my God, parents are the worst.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.787
Yeah, yeah, it's been hard
on my little brother.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.040
I mean, it's been tough
on both of us but...

17:21.790 --> 17:22.666
for a ten-year-old...

17:22.750 --> 17:26.003
Sadie's top is TDF.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.547
I would totally slay in it.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.759
Yeah. Um...

17:32.092 --> 17:33.302
I'm, I'm gonna mingle.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.760
Did she get stung by bees or something?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.763
I don't think there's that
many bees on Earth.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.108
Lily?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.610
Lily, what happened?

18:31.693 --> 18:32.861
I, I glowed up.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.239
Isn't that what you wanted?

18:35.322 --> 18:38.117
What? No, no. I, I thought you were smart.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.202
Someone cool that I could talk to?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.704
Guess I was wrong.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.383
Come on. Come on. Come on.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.308
Hello, is anyone here?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.277
Hello?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.411
What are you doing here?

20:46.954 --> 20:48.205
You shouldn't be here.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.581
What's going on?

20:50.332 --> 20:52.417
There are people in the mirrors.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.627
Not people.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.337
Souls.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.297
Essences.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.509
Who are they?

21:00.592 --> 21:03.929
Girls and boys who believed
their ears were too big,

21:04.012 --> 21:05.889
or their eyes too small.

21:06.515 --> 21:10.185
Who hated the shape of their body,
who wished they had better skin.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.145
People like you...

21:12.604 --> 21:16.984
who were tired of being told
to have more realistic expectations.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.038
No.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.499
No, I want my old life back.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.084
MS.It doesn't work that way.

21:34.167 --> 21:37.838
I give you beauty, and in return,
you give me your essence.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.589
No take-backs.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.050
How could you do this to me?

21:42.134 --> 21:45.095
Funny, I don't recall forcing you.

21:45.178 --> 21:48.724
I simply handed you the brush,
and this is what you painted with it.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.517
Oh, don't beat yourself up.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.353
I've known a lot of humans
through the centuries,

21:53.437 --> 21:55.188
and one thing's never changed.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.443
They'll choose outer beauty
over inner beauty every time.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.414
Don't do that.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.250
Your forehead.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.678
I said, no take-backs.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.894
MS.No. No!

22:43.403 --> 22:44.905
Look what you've done!

22:44.988 --> 22:46.698
I'm hideous.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.408
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.285
MS.No!

23:19.773 --> 23:21.316
-Nubia?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.401
Correct!

23:22.484 --> 23:23.819
Yeah! Go, Carmen!

23:23.902 --> 23:27.531
This final question will determine
which team goes to state.

23:27.614 --> 23:31.827
"The most common texture heard
in Quranic recitation is?"

23:33.495 --> 23:35.163
-Monophonic.
-That is...

23:35.247 --> 23:36.331
correct!

23:37.374 --> 23:38.500
Yes!

23:40.919 --> 23:42.087
Thank you.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.388
Congratulations, champ.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.516
I'm, I'm sorry,
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.351
Please, Carmen, will you just...

23:56.435 --> 23:58.270
Carmen, can you just look at me?

24:00.605 --> 24:02.315
What am I even looking at?

24:02.399 --> 24:04.192
I mean, you look like you again.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.694
Because I am.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.697
I thought being pretty and popular
would make me happy,

24:08.780 --> 24:11.616
but it wasn't worth everything I lost.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.076
You hurt me.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.830
I know, and I wish
I could take it all back.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.416
I understand if you never
wanna speak to me again.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.584
Good.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.877
Glad you understand.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.137
You were incredibly basic.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.223
Beyond basic.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.727
So, are you going to tell me
everything that happened or not?

24:38.810 --> 24:41.354
Carmen, you've no idea.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.106
CARMEN
Tell me about it...

24:43.190 --> 24:44.274
All right.
