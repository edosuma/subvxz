WEBVTT

00:02.378 --> 00:05.040
What attacked Talyn was
a retrieval squad.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.417
Aeryn, my name is Xhalax Sun.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.840
You were conceived in love.

00:09.927 --> 00:14.170
The squad is under the command
of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.846
My mother.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.766
My superior officers knew
I visited you that night.

00:18.853 --> 00:22.846
They gave me a chance to redeem
myself by killing your father.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.226
We let her live, she comes,
she hunts us down again.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.684
Aeryn, you should not be
the one to do this.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.939
We must not let Xhalax live.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.022
Crichton:
You want her dead, you do it.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.196
Crais:
As you wish.

00:33.284 --> 00:35.741
Go! Go now! You must not
witness this.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.238
No!

00:38.915 --> 00:41.406
(gunfire)

00:43.294 --> 00:45.751
What is the matter?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.831
Radiation.

00:49.926 --> 00:51.666
Massive radiation.

00:51.761 --> 00:54.218
I couldn't stop it.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.388
Don't worry about me.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.680
I've never felt better.

01:20.331 --> 01:23.368
And now, on Farscape...

01:24.293 --> 01:26.284
(all mumbling)

01:44.438 --> 01:47.305
| talk to the dead.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.143
I can help find the
dead one you seek.

01:51.237 --> 01:53.102
Pay me. Pay me, and
I can help...

01:53.197 --> 01:55.313
(gasping)

02:00.913 --> 02:02.904
(whispering voice):
Aeryn...

02:10.965 --> 02:13.877
Crais:
It's your fault Aeryn's
down on Valldonl

02:13.968 --> 02:16.254
Not my fault! Trying to help!

02:16.345 --> 02:18.757
Trying to help?!
She's in mourning for Crichton!

02:18.848 --> 02:23.091
How are you helping by filling
her head with crazy tales about
spirit channelers?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.676
It's not crazy.
She wanted to get away from you.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.272
She sees you following her.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.892
l'm following her?
You're the one that's
following her!

02:28.983 --> 02:32.146
Me? Aeryn wants me around.
She wants me to watch over her.

02:32.236 --> 02:35.273
Sh-She wants me to protect her
from people like you!

02:35.364 --> 02:37.605
You stupid, selfish nak-noks!

02:37.700 --> 02:41.067
Aeryn has made it clear she
wants nothing to do
with any of us.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.325
She wants no part of your
plan to find Moya and...

02:44.415 --> 02:46.201
Can't leave her on Valldon.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.532
It's dangerous.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.044
Then it's just like here.

02:52.131 --> 02:56.841
You're a mystic, and we're
criminals, but Aeryn doesn't
want to be here.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.339
You don't understand.
-l...

02:59.430 --> 03:02.092
What is it we don't
understand, slave?

03:02.183 --> 03:03.969
She...

03:05.144 --> 03:07.886
she's going to talk
to Crichton.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.339
Male:
Is it you?

03:41.430 --> 03:45.343
Yes, it's Aeryn Sun.
l have changed my mind.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.263
I want you to raise that man.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.265
Which one do you seek?

03:50.356 --> 03:53.143
Talyn Lyczak, my father.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.857
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:02.952 --> 04:06.661
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:06.747 --> 04:08.328
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:08.416 --> 04:10.327
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:10.418 --> 04:13.125
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.702
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.788
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:16.882 --> 04:19.339
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:19.427 --> 04:24.137
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.305
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:26.392 --> 04:29.099
Not show them...
You exist...

04:29.186 --> 04:32.895
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.389
Do you remember?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.484
Ah...

05:17.568 --> 05:19.524
( snickers )

05:20.863 --> 05:23.275
Who the frell are you?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.447
I remember it all now.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.196
What are you talking about?

05:33.042 --> 05:34.532
Touch me.

05:35.794 --> 05:40.538
Don't be afraid, girl.
I... I ain't going to bite.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.294
Touch me.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.422
Remember it all.

05:49.517 --> 05:54.261
l was a pilot, Aeryn.
Astronaut.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.641
l was what I wanted to be.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.153
It's all there.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.237
( groans )
-You all right?

06:09.328 --> 06:10.363
Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.661
It's just the same old pain.
Same pain.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.363
(gasps )

06:14.458 --> 06:17.291
It's just the same old pain.
Same pain.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.889
Oh, I got it.
I got your locket.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.889
Whose, uh, image you
got in here anyway?

06:35.980 --> 06:37.220
You know who's in there.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.565
( knocking )

06:47.533 --> 06:50.275
Are you Aeryn Sun?

06:55.457 --> 06:59.200
I heard you talking to somebody.
I thought you were alone.

06:59.295 --> 07:00.455
lam.

07:02.214 --> 07:07.129
Now, you knew I came here
searching for someone
else, but...

07:07.219 --> 07:08.755
let's do it.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.711
Do what?

07:10.806 --> 07:15.846
You found me. You told me
that you could contact
my dead father.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.313
So show me.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.935
You don't believe
I can reach him?

07:22.026 --> 07:27.692
Look, you're here, I'm willing
to pay and that is all that
should concern you.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.945
Will you show me your face?

07:45.299 --> 07:51.215
If I may ask, what business
have you with Talyn Lyczak?

07:56.393 --> 07:58.258
l was his daughter.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.352
(grunts)

08:06.153 --> 08:10.021
So, can you contact him?

08:11.325 --> 08:15.318
I can do more than that.

08:15.412 --> 08:19.246
I am Talyn Lyczak.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.796
Man:
The world is full of demons!

08:28.884 --> 08:30.249
Rygel:
Get away! Get back!

08:30.344 --> 08:31.584
Zhaan:
Stark.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.714
Rygel, Rygel!
-Stark.

08:32.805 --> 08:34.386
There...
-What?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.213
Do you see Aeryn?
-Stark.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.468
No.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.470
For a moment, I thought I heard
Zhaan's voice.

08:39.561 --> 08:43.930
Oh, frelling brasma, tell me
you're joking, right?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.187
No. No.
-Stark....

08:47.277 --> 08:49.233
Crais... Crais!

08:49.321 --> 08:51.858
Yes, Rygel. Have you located
Aeryn's signal yet?

08:51.949 --> 08:53.530
No. She's masked it.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.118
We've been all over this
stinking city.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.160
Now we're in some kind of
nakky hotel.

08:58.247 --> 09:01.535
( growling )
Stark's meeting every cousin
and furbot he ever knew.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.162
It's a planet of Starks
down here!

09:04.253 --> 09:05.117
You're exaggerating.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.328
There! There it is again!

09:07.423 --> 09:09.038
Zhaan's voice!

09:09.133 --> 09:11.044
Crais, get down here!

09:11.135 --> 09:12.671
I can't stand it
alone with him.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.877
No, no, no, stay with him
until you find Aeryn.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.337
Zhaan (whispering ):
Stark.

09:16.432 --> 09:18.172
Call me when you do.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.757
Crais? Crais!

09:19.852 --> 09:21.513
(gasps )
-I talk to the dead.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.139
H see...

09:23.230 --> 09:26.267
Oh, stop. Just stop.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.440
That blood's so fake,
it's laughable.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.438
(mocking laughter)

09:30.529 --> 09:33.191
(whispering ):
Kellor. Kellor...

09:33.282 --> 09:35.238
she misses you.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.824
Kellor?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.288
She forgives you.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.660
She knows that you couldn't
go against your parents.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.036
How do you know her name?

09:45.127 --> 09:47.288
She knows that a Dominar
cannot just...

09:47.379 --> 09:49.961
No! Get away from me!
-Wait! But I know more...

09:50.048 --> 09:51.299
No!
-secrets.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.625
Secrets she didn't want
me to tell you.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.551
Pay me, I can tell you.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.503
Did you tell them about me?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.760
Rygel, did you get touched?

10:00.851 --> 10:04.139
l'll touch you if you keep
telling these fekiks about me!

10:04.229 --> 10:07.437
But I didn't. I warned you that
this planet had dark powers.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.230
You're full of yotz!

10:09.318 --> 10:11.229
This whole place is
full of yotz.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.278
Rygel, you must guard your
spirit. Now follow me.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.151
l was told that the owner of
this hotel may know
where Aeryn is.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.527
( people grunting, muttering )

10:18.619 --> 10:20.655
Oh! Back! Back!

10:26.794 --> 10:30.252
Lyczak:
I had my face altered,
so I could hide.

10:37.554 --> 10:41.968
Early Peacekeeper standard
blood spectrometer.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.804
Fairly primitive, yes.

10:44.895 --> 10:50.856
But accurate, to near 100%
certainty. (whirring )

11:02.913 --> 11:05.245
(whirring )

11:06.583 --> 11:09.450
Compare the spectrographs.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.674
Take a hundred of mine,
and they will all match.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.563
Aeryn...

11:39.449 --> 11:43.317
l... I understand.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.653
This is not what you want.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.618
Goodbye, Aeryn.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.337
Wait.

12:00.429 --> 12:03.341
Stark:
Hello? Is anyone here?

12:06.894 --> 12:12.810
Back away slowly. Very slowly.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.143
Lucky I saw you through the
peephole and was quick enough
to deactivate it.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.853
Deactivate what?
There's nothing I can...

12:19.948 --> 12:22.109
(metal whining)

12:22.200 --> 12:25.442
Protection and
mutilation combined.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.700
Much more effective than
an attack animal.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.327
Are you here to buy
dead bodies?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.579
You've gotta outbid him.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.206
He buys all his from me.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.207
Buys 'em fresh.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.289
Rygel:
We are not here for bodies.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.169
We are here to find a Sebacean.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.171
Stark:
Named Aeryn Sun.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.503
She's very beautiful.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.589
Hair as dark as a fellip berry.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.298
Shut up, Stark.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.304
Stark:
She usually wears it
tight, pulled back.

12:50.395 --> 12:54.138
But recently, she's taken
to wearing it out, down
to her shoulders.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.483
We're close, very close.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.148
They're not close at all.

12:57.235 --> 13:01.274
He's some kind of weird
probakto and she can't
stand the smell of...

13:01.365 --> 13:02.980
(groaning)

13:03.075 --> 13:04.235
That's not true.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.282
It's more than true.

13:06.370 --> 13:10.909
But we are trying to find
her so we can get out
of this nak house.

13:10.999 --> 13:14.912
Hmm, no Sebaceans here anymore.

13:15.003 --> 13:18.712
You might try the Stallic Hotel
on the far side of the city.

13:18.799 --> 13:22.041
I hear they stay there.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.126
"Far side of the city"?!

13:24.221 --> 13:25.677
I'm not traveling tonight.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.096
How much for your finest room?
-Zhaan (whispering ):
Stark...

13:28.183 --> 13:29.719
Finest room?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.300
Where do you think you are?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.852
This is a refugee city...
Zhaan (whispering ):
Stark...

13:33.939 --> 13:35.770
and you've got to fight
for tent space.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.643
( rattling )
-Get away!

13:37.734 --> 13:41.272
Look at my foyer.
Infested with kratada.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.194
Frell off!

13:43.281 --> 13:44.316
By the goddess, Rygel...

13:44.408 --> 13:46.990
What is it?
Better not be Zhaan again.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.692
Don't let her see us.
Don't let her see us.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.153
Oh, don't let her see us.
-Banik, let go of me.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.408
Shut up!

13:52.833 --> 13:54.198
It can't be her.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.418
It can't be.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.958
Who? Aeryn?

13:57.045 --> 13:58.251
No, no, no, no, no.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.207
(gasping)

14:00.298 --> 14:02.584
Is that... Aeryn's mother?

14:02.676 --> 14:05.167
I told you to leave them alone.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.798
I did. I did.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.265
You were talking to that slug.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.806
Were you telling them about me?
-No, no, no.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.181
I paid you a lot of money.
I paid all of you a
lot of money.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.809
I would never betray you,
Xhalax. I never would.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.060
Not anymore.

14:20.152 --> 14:20.937
(groaning)

14:21.028 --> 14:22.017
(gasping):
Frell!

14:22.112 --> 14:23.067
( groans )

14:25.407 --> 14:27.238
Xhalax:
Get rid of the body.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.786
By the goddess.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.540
Crichton was right.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.003
You never killed Xhalax!

14:39.087 --> 14:40.702
Get them off me! Let me up.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.335
The only time we're letting
you up is when we flush
you out the airlock.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.882
What happened to Xhalax?
Tell us!

14:45.969 --> 14:47.300
Let me up!

14:49.639 --> 14:52.221
Tell us. You tell us!

14:52.309 --> 14:56.678
When you left me to kill Xhalax,
I saw instantly the end.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.763
For you.
-For all of us.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.143
I knew that if! killed her,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.691
High Command would send another
Retrieval Squad after us.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.816
And if they failed,
another and another.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.489
You made a deal to save us all.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.237
I offered Xhalax her life.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.284
And what did you get in return?

15:13.371 --> 15:15.703
She would inform High Command
that we were all dead.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.952
Do I look like an idiot?
Huh? Huh?

15:18.043 --> 15:20.910
Does he look like an idiot?
Do I look like an idiot?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.790
Yeah. Well, I'm not.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.167
And we're not fooled by you.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.250
If you've got a deity,
you better make your
peace with it now,

15:28.345 --> 15:31.803
because I'm going to lead you
to the other side real quick.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.005
No.

15:33.100 --> 15:33.964
No?

15:34.059 --> 15:35.174
What, no?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.975
Rygel understands our
predicament.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.974
Talyn has part of my psyche.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.976
Can you fly him?

15:42.067 --> 15:44.183
No, but Aeryn can.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.233
And she's not here.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.561
(giggIeS)

15:47.656 --> 15:50.318
Why did you come to
this planet?

15:50.408 --> 15:54.822
You said at first it was
not to contact me.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.620
Who were you seeking?

15:57.707 --> 15:59.447
I lost someone.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.042
He died.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.370
Were you in love with him?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.795
Aeryn, on this planet,

16:08.885 --> 16:12.173
l have seen things I never
dreamed possible.

16:12.264 --> 16:15.631
At the fall of the moon,
I will come back

16:15.725 --> 16:20.765
with a being who might be
able to help contact the
one you loved.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.562
Wait for me, please.

16:22.649 --> 16:26.392
I want to try to do
this for you.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.987
Here. Have you seen him before?

16:37.372 --> 16:40.455
Yes, I've seen him.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.749
Well, do you know who he is?

16:42.836 --> 16:45.999
No one.

16:46.089 --> 16:52.426
Just... I hear he had been
studying with the nelliks
who channel the dead.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.377
Do you know where he's from?

16:54.472 --> 16:56.212
No.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.471
Ugh! Ijust heard he's been
hiding on Valldon for
a few cycles,

16:59.561 --> 17:01.643
but everyone's hiding, so...

17:01.730 --> 17:03.266
Was he a Peacekeeper?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.311
I don't know.

17:04.399 --> 17:08.984
Oh! Someone could use some
fellip nectar.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.935
You know where to get it.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.612
What a good idea.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.200
( laughs )

17:28.757 --> 17:30.122
How can no one have seen Aeryn?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.754
They have.
They're just not talking.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.220
Wait. I've got an idea.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.886
Stark, what are you doing?

17:36.973 --> 17:39.931
Leave her alone and
let her die in peace.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.976
Oh yotz, here we go again.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.311
Get these off me.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.266
( laughs )

17:50.362 --> 17:52.227
You're not a child like he is.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.108
How can I help you
if I'm cuffed?

17:54.199 --> 17:55.405
Oh, you'll help.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.950
If someone starts shooting,
you'll make a very good shield.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.698
( Rygel chuckles )

18:03.333 --> 18:06.245
She thinks Aeryn may be here
on one of the upper levels.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.167
Right. I'll go.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.244
I'll stay calm.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.204
I'll take this fekik with me.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.335
You can tell Aeryn what he did.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.542
You keep an eye out for Xhalax.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.003
Oh, not now.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.133
Get away!

18:19.224 --> 18:20.760
(roaring)

19:00.890 --> 19:03.176
Right here.
-This had better not be
the wrong room.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.883
It won't be.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.346
Aeryn? Are you in there?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.182
Aeryn, are you all right?

19:12.277 --> 19:14.063
You look terrible.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.610
What have you been doing?
Have you...

19:15.697 --> 19:17.233
This is serious.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.155
We need to talk. Can I come in?

19:19.242 --> 19:21.278
No.
-Alright, that does it.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.779
Get down, on your knees,
face the wall.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.031
I am not getting on my knees!

19:24.122 --> 19:26.488
Get down!
-You told Rygel you'd be calm.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.199
I am calm! You get down now!

19:36.384 --> 19:40.047
Aeryn, you must return
to Talyn.

19:40.138 --> 19:44.302
We... We saw Xhalax
here on Valldon.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.551
It's this place.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.260
You should see who I've seen.

19:49.356 --> 19:53.599
No, no, your mother is
really, really here.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.730
I know. Guess who've I've seen?

19:56.821 --> 19:58.357
Crichton.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.905
And guess who else?
My father.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.278
Any microt now, Stark, you're
going to see Zhaan.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.486
You stop. You listen to me.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.287
He... he never killed Xhalax.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.161
He was preparing to betray us.

20:10.251 --> 20:13.163
That is not true.
I made a deal for all of us.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.710
Liar! Liar!

20:14.798 --> 20:17.414
Now, you must come
back with us.

20:17.509 --> 20:21.218
I will look after you.
I want to look after you.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.135
That would be really nice.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.258
Oh.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.180
Please.
-Don't touch me.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.305
Crais:
Aeryn, Xhalax is alive.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.053
( laughs )
Come on.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.105
Come on.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.313
Come on, Crais.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.565
You can tell the truth. Hmm?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.146
You get up. Get away from him.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.027
No, that's all right.
He wants me.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.234
Isn't that right? You always
wanted to take me from Crichton

20:45.328 --> 20:47.364
and now here's your chance.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.993
(whispering ):
I do not want Bialar.

20:52.085 --> 20:58.251
If I squeeze my eyes closed
tightly enough,

20:58.341 --> 21:00.206
you could be someone else.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.290
(grunting)

21:01.386 --> 21:02.546
No, come on. Right here.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.468
Right now. Give it to me.
Give me what you've got.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.137
You're coming with me.
I'm taking now.

21:06.224 --> 21:09.637
Don't you touch me!

21:10.353 --> 21:11.468
Or I swear...

21:11.563 --> 21:14.430
I will spear the last eye
you have left.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.350
Do you know what makes
you so much worse?

21:18.445 --> 21:21.403
Is the fact that you think
you're so much better than him.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.569
Always pressing against me.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.946
Stealing looks.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.745
Get out of here.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.580
Both of you. Get out!

21:42.510 --> 21:49.177
Uh, excuse me, have you seen
a cripple who was bleeding
from the eyes?

21:49.267 --> 21:51.349
He knew about a certain
female I...

21:51.436 --> 21:53.927
Ta-nak-nee! Nee-nak-nak!

21:54.397 --> 21:55.352
Ra!

21:55.440 --> 21:56.805
Well, don't get excited.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.140
Wah!
-| just, uh...

21:58.234 --> 21:59.485
Peasanﬂ

22:00.361 --> 22:01.225
Watch out.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.061
Hmm, watch your step.
-Move.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.317
Pushy, pushy!

22:16.377 --> 22:18.834
Do you know who that was?

22:18.922 --> 22:21.163
That slug was with Aeryn.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.418
He was trying to save her.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.886
How'd it go?

22:25.970 --> 22:29.303
Oh, I think Aeryn's
buying it all.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.381
When she sees this bastard,

22:31.476 --> 22:33.888
she'll suffer the way
you want her to.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.354
(groaning)

22:35.438 --> 22:38.225
Oh, someone's getting restless.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.102
I better get up there.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.433
You're all set?

22:41.528 --> 22:44.486
Under here, solid krank.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.235
Don't miss.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.905
I won't.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.216
First Talyn,

23:07.971 --> 23:10.087
then Xhalax.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.046
What next?

23:22.694 --> 23:24.935
(wind blowing)

23:30.994 --> 23:33.406
( shouting ):
Crichton!

23:35.206 --> 23:38.448
Crichton!

23:40.461 --> 23:45.000
Crichton!

23:49.137 --> 23:51.298
(thunder rumbling)

23:51.389 --> 23:53.846
Crichton:
That's it.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.174
Earth.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.895
Minus the sunshine.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.396
This is my world now.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.897
Think I liked yours better.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.254
(grunting)

25:16.349 --> 25:19.386
Let me guess. You're my
long lost sister.

25:20.228 --> 25:24.312
Look, Aeryn, I know
you're upset.

25:24.399 --> 25:28.062
I, too, had someone
important in my life.

25:28.152 --> 25:31.189
Kellor was her name.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.022
I missed her for a long time.

25:34.117 --> 25:40.488
But I knew, as I'm sure you do,
that self-sacrifice is
not the answer.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.448
Look, I'm not like
Crais or Stark.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.331
I'm not trying to save you
or recreate with you.

25:47.422 --> 25:51.381
You can do whatever you like,
but Crichton loved you, Aeryn.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.755
He wouldn't want his death
to lead you here.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.963
(wind gusts)
Oh, ah! Oh! Oh!

26:00.184 --> 26:02.971
Please, could we go inside?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.177
This height...

26:04.272 --> 26:06.058
You're not going in there.
-Huh?

26:08.276 --> 26:09.857
( knocking )

26:12.905 --> 26:14.520
You have to go now.

26:14.615 --> 26:18.699
I should also tell you,
Crais and Stark weren't lying.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.447
Xhalax is on this planet.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.870
And I wasn't lying, either.
My father's here, too.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.494
Crazy place, Ryg. Now, go.

26:25.585 --> 26:26.449
But, uh...

26:26.544 --> 26:27.579
Go!

26:34.427 --> 26:36.588
I've brought the Seer.

26:42.560 --> 26:50.308
Seer Cresus, the one we seek
is not long dead.

26:50.401 --> 26:58.399
His name is John Crichton and
he's from a race called Human.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.534
Come here.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.861
Closer.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.912
lwon't bite...

27:06.000 --> 27:06.989
much.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.585
( laughs )

27:09.378 --> 27:12.245
Trust him. Don't be afraid.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.331
Seer Cresus:
Touch me.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.168
I must feel you...

27:18.262 --> 27:20.469
to reach him.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.019
(panting)

27:32.109 --> 27:35.943
Soft. Touch me... soft.

27:38.115 --> 27:41.653
Tell me about this Crichton.

27:44.247 --> 27:46.863
Uh... he...

27:47.291 --> 27:49.873
Did he love you?

27:51.420 --> 27:53.331
Hold you?

27:53.422 --> 27:56.664
Touch you... soft?

27:58.094 --> 28:00.085
Yes, he loved me.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.386
He was very...

28:03.808 --> 28:05.469
he made me better.

28:06.936 --> 28:10.895
(gagging )

28:17.029 --> 28:18.769
Aeryn?

28:18.865 --> 28:20.730
Help me.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.281
Bring me back.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.278
(gasps )

28:23.369 --> 28:24.870
(sighs)

28:24.954 --> 28:26.569
(gagging continues)

28:26.664 --> 28:30.407
Cresus, are you all right?

28:30.501 --> 28:37.168
(speaking in alien language)

28:42.263 --> 28:50.352
Cresus says he has rarely had
a vision so powerful

28:50.438 --> 28:53.976
and he wants me to
find the Sintar.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.352
He is a creature who can...

28:56.444 --> 29:00.562
sometimes turn spirits
corporeal.

29:01.824 --> 29:04.156
That's not possible.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.154
Oh, Aeryn!

29:06.245 --> 29:12.457
On this planet, I have
seen things I have not
thought possible.

29:12.543 --> 29:15.626
Wait here.
I will find the Sintar.

29:15.713 --> 29:21.299
If the connection is strong
enough, if he thinks
this can happen...

29:21.385 --> 29:23.501
He can bring Crichton back?

29:24.013 --> 29:25.469
Perhaps.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.847
Don't lose hope.

29:29.894 --> 29:33.307
Not... yet.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.805
Wait here.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.266
I will not be long.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.363
Just believe.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.788
I returned from the dead.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.172
Why can't he?

30:07.515 --> 30:09.346
(sighs)

30:15.356 --> 30:17.392
Crichton:
This is where it hurts.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.723
Yeah.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.399
Right here.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.357
(sighs)

30:30.413 --> 30:32.779
You can't bring me back,
you know.

30:32.873 --> 30:38.709
Mmm, they said that on this
planet there's a...

30:39.547 --> 30:41.162
I've forgotten his name.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.918
No.

30:44.802 --> 30:45.791
No?

30:45.886 --> 30:47.296
No.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.891
(sighs)

30:54.979 --> 30:57.891
Was it easy to be a hero?

30:59.275 --> 31:01.311
Leave me behind?

31:03.529 --> 31:08.023
You never think you're
going to die.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.985
I didn't know.

31:14.248 --> 31:17.206
You... you did.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.251
You did.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.714
No.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.020
(sighs)

31:52.745 --> 31:54.906
Hello, soldier.
What's the matter?

31:54.997 --> 31:57.409
Surprised to see your old mum?

31:58.542 --> 32:03.127
This isn't quite the family
reunion you'd imagined.

32:03.214 --> 32:04.920
Sit down.

32:10.596 --> 32:14.214
Soldier without her weapon.
That's against regulations.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.599
My leg, huh?

32:17.686 --> 32:23.226
After you left me on that
planet, it got infected.

32:24.235 --> 32:27.648
And I had to amputate
it myself.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.979
Now, that...

32:31.826 --> 32:33.862
that hurt.

32:33.953 --> 32:37.070
You thought you could
get it all.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.871
Get away. Be safe.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.199
Xhalax?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.204
Hello, dear.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.331
NolDonﬂ

32:45.422 --> 32:48.960
You've only just met, and
already you're trying to
protect your father.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.131
Xhalax, stop!

32:50.219 --> 32:54.838
Twenty cycles ago, we made
a pact to survive for...

32:54.932 --> 32:56.342
for our daughter.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.140
You couldn't hurt her then.
You couldn't hurt me.

32:59.228 --> 33:02.186
I can hurt you now, old man.
So get ready to die.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.355
Remember when Aeryn was born?

33:04.441 --> 33:06.432
l snuck into the med-chamber.

33:06.527 --> 33:08.859
You had just woken...
-Lie down.

33:08.946 --> 33:11.187
Aeryn:
Listen, he's not the
one that you... -Shut up.

33:11.282 --> 33:12.738
Just leave him alone!
-Shut up!

33:12.825 --> 33:14.907
Oh, go on, shoot me.

33:14.994 --> 33:19.363
I'm not scared of you.
Shoot me and leave Aeryn alone.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.867
You know, I think I've
changed my mind.

33:24.962 --> 33:28.375
You're too ugly to kill.
Looking at that face.

33:29.425 --> 33:30.961
Now, lie down.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.211
Lie down and roll over.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.588
Xhalax, wh-what are you...

33:33.679 --> 33:35.294
Turn around, now.

33:35.389 --> 33:38.222
Xhalax, just stop...
-Shut up! Lie down!

33:38.309 --> 33:39.173
Aeryn:
Just leave him alone!
-Roll over!

33:39.268 --> 33:40.508
No, no.
-Xhalax, don't.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.093
Roll over!

33:43.355 --> 33:45.391
(groans weakly)

33:47.443 --> 33:49.434
So.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.611
So now it's just you and me.

33:59.246 --> 34:03.080
You know, things couldn't
have worked out better.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.533
I'm glad you two got to meet.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.331
Why?

34:09.882 --> 34:11.588
For this.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.291
For you to suffer.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.877
For everything you did.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.803
For everything that went wrong.

34:20.935 --> 34:23.142
we did nothing to you.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.769
You did everything.

34:29.401 --> 34:33.394
After your birth, High Command
said I could redeem myself if...

34:34.865 --> 34:36.446
But they lied.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.154
The damage was done.

34:39.245 --> 34:43.739
And no matter what I did,
I was never truly reinstated.

34:43.832 --> 34:46.244
And now you want my pity?

34:46.335 --> 34:48.701
Oh no, I want your pain.

34:51.215 --> 34:55.333
To know how close
I was to love.

34:56.845 --> 34:59.302
So close...

35:00.391 --> 35:03.303
and then to lose it
all in an instant.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.514
I've heard...

35:09.608 --> 35:15.148
loved ones leave you in pieces.

35:15.239 --> 35:19.482
That little by little, you start
to forget things about them.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.703
But that's not true.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.786
You lose them...

35:25.916 --> 35:28.953
everything, instantly.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.080
And suddenly nothing can
replace them.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.837
Nothing.

35:40.180 --> 35:44.514
And now you have nothing.

35:46.603 --> 35:49.345
How does it feel?

35:49.440 --> 35:52.102
Stark:
You lied to us, said
Aeryn wasn't here!

35:52.192 --> 35:54.103
No, no, I... I didn't lie.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.855
Did Xhalax pay you
to keep us away?

35:55.946 --> 35:57.402
Who? I've never heard of them.

35:57.489 --> 36:01.107
Now, tell me again, how do you
activate this Security Grill?

36:01.201 --> 36:02.577
Do Ijust push this?
-No, no, no, don't touch that!

36:02.661 --> 36:04.697
Why? Will those speary
things shoot up...

36:04.788 --> 36:07.495
Look, look!
I had to lie to you.

36:07.583 --> 36:12.418
If I'd helped you before,
that maniac upstairs
would have killed me.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.539
Rygel:
Go on.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.087
There is a service lift.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.381
Xhalax doesn't know about it.

36:17.468 --> 36:19.333
One of you could go up in that.

36:19.428 --> 36:20.292
Surprise her.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.673
Uh, Stark...

36:22.765 --> 36:24.005
What?

36:24.099 --> 36:25.214
Who are they?

36:25.309 --> 36:27.174
(gunfire)

36:27.269 --> 36:28.019
Down!

36:28.103 --> 36:29.479
Crais:
Uncuff me!

36:30.439 --> 36:32.145
Uncuff me!

36:33.442 --> 36:35.478
Under the circumstances...

36:35.569 --> 36:37.309
uncuff him!

36:41.742 --> 36:44.108
Wasn't killing Talyn
once enough?

36:46.205 --> 36:49.117
But did you have to kill him
in front of me?

36:49.917 --> 36:52.203
Is that what was missing?

36:57.383 --> 37:00.250
When I first met him,
I knew he wasn't my father.

37:00.344 --> 37:03.962
But he knew all these details
about you and me.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.387
You're lying.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.306
You didn't know.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.932
( chuckles )

37:13.023 --> 37:17.813
Of course, I hoped that
he might be Talyn...

37:19.571 --> 37:22.688
Just as I'd hoped that I might
see Crichton again.

37:25.035 --> 37:29.904
But in my heart I knew that
that was not my father.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.494
And then you walked in.

37:35.879 --> 37:44.253
You know, we Peacekeepers think
that we are so remarkable.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.798
Soldiers without equal.

37:48.892 --> 37:52.430
Precise tacticians, pure bloods.

37:54.398 --> 37:58.311
But I've realized that
we're not remarkable.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.358
We do nothing for love.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.229
Not one thing.

38:08.245 --> 38:11.282
You're wrong.

38:11.373 --> 38:16.788
Cycles ago, after your birth,
I was given an order.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.837
They called it a choice.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.301
One of you must die, they said.

38:29.308 --> 38:34.143
I killed your father
so you could live.

38:36.899 --> 38:40.312
I did that for love.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.484
Zhaan (whispering ):
Stark...

38:42.571 --> 38:44.357
It's here again!
-Stark...

38:44.448 --> 38:46.359
It's Zhaan's voice.
Can you hear it?

38:46.450 --> 38:47.360
Not now, Stark.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.737
Stark, get down!
-Save Aeryn!

38:50.412 --> 38:51.743
I'll hold them off here.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.990
Go! Go!

38:54.041 --> 38:55.326
(gunfire)

39:01.924 --> 39:05.758
So, this is it.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.301
Kill me now.

39:08.388 --> 39:11.300
Destroy the last piece
of your life,

39:11.391 --> 39:13.256
and leave nothing.

39:13.352 --> 39:18.392
I wasn't an assassin until
I killed your father.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.142
l was a pilot.

39:23.237 --> 39:26.149
l was bred to be a pilot.

39:27.241 --> 39:30.779
But they made me kill
again and again.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.738
And finally I stopped caring.

39:37.417 --> 39:41.205
But I knew your suffering
would ease my pain.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.880
And it has.

39:45.968 --> 39:48.505
It has.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.007
The battle's over, Xhalax.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.838
You don't want to kill me.

39:52.933 --> 39:54.389
No?

39:59.273 --> 40:01.355
(gunfire)

40:01.441 --> 40:03.181
Why don't you come out
here a bit closer?

40:03.277 --> 40:05.233
It might make it
easier for you.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.739
Here.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.368
You can't miss from here.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.742
Unless you want to.

40:21.837 --> 40:23.373
(gunfire)

40:30.387 --> 40:32.548
Drop the gun, Xhalax.

40:47.404 --> 40:48.610
( crashing )
Aeryn!

40:48.697 --> 40:49.732
No!

40:49.823 --> 40:51.324
( screams )

40:52.242 --> 40:53.402
No!

40:57.831 --> 40:59.787
Let me fall, Aeryn.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.115
No.

41:01.501 --> 41:02.707
Do it.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.580
(gasping)

41:04.671 --> 41:06.536
Let me go.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.374
(grunting)

41:11.595 --> 41:14.211
I died a long time ago.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.020
You live for me.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.700
I know she's trying to reach me
and I must discover

41:44.795 --> 41:47.628
what it is she needs
to communicate.

41:47.714 --> 41:51.047
Please do not waste time
trying to look for me.

41:51.134 --> 41:56.345
It is vital you take what
I have left you to the
Crichton on Moya.

41:56.431 --> 42:01.266
He, and only he, will know
what to do with it.

42:02.354 --> 42:04.219
Goodbye, my friends.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.431
Take care of Aeryn.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.608
I will find you again.

42:20.288 --> 42:23.530
Crais, why would Stark
leave this?

42:23.625 --> 42:26.867
What do you think the other
Crichton wants with it?

42:26.962 --> 42:29.123
I have no idea.

42:30.632 --> 42:34.545
Talyn believes he's
located Moya.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.218
His long-range scans
have detected

42:37.305 --> 42:41.674
Leviathan transmissions from
the Manin Nebula.

42:41.768 --> 42:44.259
Well, let's try to find them.

42:44.354 --> 42:46.891
It'll be good to get
back to Moya.

42:48.150 --> 42:48.855
Perhaps.

42:48.942 --> 42:50.273
(sighs)

42:51.528 --> 42:54.645
As soon as our ships are
reunited and...

42:54.740 --> 42:58.699
Talyn can find someone other
than me to pilot him,
I should leave.

42:58.785 --> 43:02.494
I, uh, hope Moya's done
better than we have.

43:03.373 --> 43:05.455
ls Aeryn on her way up?

43:05.542 --> 43:08.204
She'll be leaving Valldon
within the am.

43:14.801 --> 43:16.632
Maybe...

43:18.013 --> 43:20.675
I could have become
something different.

43:22.267 --> 43:25.725
If you had lived, I could
have truly changed.

43:27.606 --> 43:29.892
But you are gone.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.274
And lam...

43:39.993 --> 43:42.279
what I was bred to be.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.410
Aeryn.

43:55.884 --> 43:57.545
Come here.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.214
No.

44:02.432 --> 44:04.889
You have to go now.

44:23.078 --> 44:24.659
Seer Cresus:
Wait.

44:26.498 --> 44:29.956
Most of the time, Aeryn,

44:30.043 --> 44:35.333
what we do is a distortion,
a hoax.

44:35.423 --> 44:39.257
But with you, Aeryn Sun,

44:39.344 --> 44:42.962
it may have been real.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.260
Shall we try...

44:46.351 --> 44:50.390
one more time?
