16:10.880 --> 16:12.120
for our father's anniversary.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.160
I'm sorry.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.520
Your life isn't your own,
Aine, okay?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.800
It's mine too.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.360
‐ I'm a grown adult, Shona.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.960
‐ Well then, you know,
act like one,

16:20.960 --> 16:22.360
because sometimes it's like
dealing with a baby.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.480
‐ Because you treat me
like a baby.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.160
‐ Because you act like a baby.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.360
‐ Because you treat me
like a baby.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.800
Chicken and fucking egg, Shona.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.080
[loud pop]

16:29.080 --> 16:30.280
‐ Shit!
What the fuck was that?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.640
‐ Waffles.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.480
VISH: Hey.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.760
SHONA: Hey.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.680
VISH: I, uh,
called you an Uber.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.600
He's about four minutes away.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.400
So I just assumed you were
gonna be late, which you are.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.480
So I'll just butter
your waffles.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.280
You can put on some shoes
and...

16:51.280 --> 16:52.840
wear some trousers maybe.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.760
SHONA: Yeah.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.680
AINE: Go on, stay and finish
your eyes, I'll tong your hair.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.240
SHONA: I don't want you
tonging my hair.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.960
‐ I'm tonging your hair
You've only four minutes.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.160
Can I have one of those
waffles, Vish?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.400
SHONA: No, you can't have
one of those waffles,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.440
'cause I've got
two waffles left.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.880
Please don't eat my waffles.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.440
AINE:
Can't I even have a bite?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.440
‐ Oh, my God.
You can have half of one, okay?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.720
‐ Thank you.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.640
[water rushing]

17:31.840 --> 17:33.640
‐ You're so brilliant

17:33.640 --> 17:37.760
and annoyingly good
at all of this stuff.

17:37.760 --> 17:42.600
And your hair
looks really nice.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.600
‐ I'm sorry.
AINE: I'm sorry.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.840
I'm sorry.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.640
SHONA: I just worry about you
all the time.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.840
Like, I worry so much
I can't sleep.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.440
And I see you go out for walks

17:55.440 --> 17:56.960
late at night
on that app thing,

17:56.960 --> 17:59.800
and I just can't trust
that you're not...

18:02.680 --> 18:05.920
Because you did, Aine,
didn't you?

18:05.920 --> 18:09.000
I mean,
you did try and kill yourself.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.880
‐ I don't wanna lie to you,
Shona,

18:14.880 --> 18:16.840
but I don't wanna make you sad.

18:16.840 --> 18:21.000
‐ Oh, Aine.

‐ I promise.
‐ Now you promise?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.840
AINE: Promise.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.160
I will never die.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.240

18:46.240 --> 18:47.440
AINE: [laughs]

18:47.440 --> 18:49.000
Ow.
‐ Don't‐‐ow.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.640
AINE: Oh, I was trying to
lighten the mood.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.960
CHARLOTTE: Hey.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.880
They're half a bottle in.
Let's start.

18:53.880 --> 18:54.880
Hi, Aine.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.480
‐ Hiya.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.560
CHARLOTTE: You okay?

18:57.560 --> 19:00.040
SHONA: Yeah.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.480
Okay, I'm gonna head out.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.960
‐ Right, yeah, you're‐‐
you're so good.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.240
I'll be outside with Vish.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.240
SHONA: I don't think she is
a nice person, by the way.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.040
‐ What? Who?

19:10.040 --> 19:11.640
‐ Lindsay Lohan.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.880

19:13.880 --> 19:18.120
[applause]

19:20.440 --> 19:21.920
Hi.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.800
Um, it's so good to‐‐

19:24.800 --> 19:26.760
to see you all here tonight.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.560
Women, eh?
[audience cheers]

19:28.560 --> 19:30.000
Who knew?

19:30.000 --> 19:35.280
So my partner refuses to be
defined by race.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.960
She, um, Charlotte,

19:38.960 --> 19:40.960
is a‐‐a great inspiration,

19:40.960 --> 19:42.880
and she's gonna be talking
to you in a bit.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.320
But while she has
the insistence

19:45.320 --> 19:49.320
of not being defined
by her outside,

19:49.320 --> 19:51.120
my other partner,

19:51.120 --> 19:53.560
he proudly embraces his race.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.200
For him, it sets him apart
in a good way.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.200
For him, it's power.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.240
Uh, I say partner.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.840
Um,
I should probably say fiancé.
[cheers and applause]

20:02.840 --> 20:04.880
Oh, God, please, no.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.400
I refuse for so many reasons

20:07.400 --> 20:10.040
to accept a round of applause
for getting engaged.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.360
If you want to
applaud me for something,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.600
let me, um, read you out my CV.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.880
[cheers and applause]

20:14.880 --> 20:16.360

20:16.360 --> 20:18.880
[cell phone buzzing]
How to use that power,

20:18.880 --> 20:21.120
the thought Charlotte and I had

20:21.120 --> 20:23.280
when we decided to, um,
set up the...

20:25.920 --> 20:27.880

CHARLOTTE: That was brilliant.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.160
SHONA: Oh, my God. Was it?
CHARLOTTE: That was so great.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.600
SHONA: How was it? Was it okay?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.280
CHARLOTTE: Oh, come on.
You were great.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.560
SHONA: You were great.
CHARLOTTE: You were so great.
