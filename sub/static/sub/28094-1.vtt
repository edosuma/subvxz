- In the name of
TCRS, I order you--

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:10.694
- But did you check article
10 of that same code?

01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:14.297
In the case of donations,
the taxable base

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:17.033
is actually the price
of the given goods

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.168
that are bought and not sold,

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:22.205
and, therefore, since
every bottle of Sokolova

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.708
wholesales for $23
that would be, uh,

01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:26.209
for 4,953 bottles.

You carry the one,

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:33.549
$113,919, and of course if
you add the 7% excise tax

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.186
that would make it, uh,

01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:40.356
$7,974

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:46.963
