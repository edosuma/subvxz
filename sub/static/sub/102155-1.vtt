00:46.313 --> 00:47.916
- How's your mom?
- She's good.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.685
Yeah? Make sure Mrs. C
gets all her change.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.152
Okay. You know she will.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.823
- I know.
- She gets it every time.

00:54.856 --> 00:57.157
Not like your brother
with his sticky fingers.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.860
That's why he's not
allowed in here.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.360
I'll keep Dougal in check.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.197
Please, Seville,
he'll kick your punk ass.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.533
Eh. <i>Mira.</i>
Why are you saying that?

01:06.568 --> 01:08.302
I'm putting empanadas
in here for you.

01:08.335 --> 01:09.970
Thanks. They're so good.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.440
They're the best
in the Heights.

01:12.474 --> 01:13.842
- All right. Thanks, Mel.
- Okay.

01:13.875 --> 01:16.009
- What's up, Seville?
- Hey.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.680
- Where do you get that from?
- Pick it up.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.822
Strike three. You're out.

01:31.426 --> 01:33.293
I'm not betraying you,
Ma.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.697
I just need more space, okay?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.333
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.802
- Hello, Mick.
- Hi.

01:40.835 --> 01:41.936
How are you?

01:43.404 --> 01:45.372
Are they for Yaya, Seamus?

01:45.406 --> 01:47.809
- Yeah.
- You're too sweet.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.376
His name's Mick, Lassie.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.880
Let's go, hard-on.

01:51.913 --> 01:54.081
Got to put this back
before Dad opens the pub.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.251
The pub?
You mean your living room?

01:57.284 --> 01:58.553
Jealous, needle dick?

02:01.255 --> 02:03.357
I made this for you.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.392
It's special.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.762
As long as you wear it,
you'll never forget me.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.432
Ali, let's go.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.235
Dimitri, why do you have to
leave?

02:15.269 --> 02:17.070
I don't understand.
I mean, I...

02:17.104 --> 02:19.139
what is wrong
with this neighborhood?

02:22.410 --> 02:24.746
What the fuck! You asshole!

02:24.779 --> 02:27.281
Yo, dingleberry, you
could have gave him the AIDS.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.019
Later, Seamus.
I'll come visit.

02:31.084 --> 02:31.886
Don't bother, Valley
girl.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.287
I'm sorry. Just space.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.723
- Darby Heights forever!
- Get off me!

02:44.331 --> 02:47.067
- You fucking ass...
- asshole!

02:47.100 --> 02:48.469
- Why?
- Breathe.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.940
- Uhh!
- Breathe.

02:51.973 --> 02:53.875
Ooh. Ah.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.275
Ah.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.277
And please,
don't use that language.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.513
Ohh.

02:59.514 --> 03:00.782
Oh, I can see

03:00.815 --> 03:02.215
that your dormant Kundalini

03:02.249 --> 03:03.885
is coiled around family pain.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.987
It's not.
It's an old bocce injury.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.455
What are you... I just...

03:07.488 --> 03:09.657
I don't have much of a family.
Ow!

03:09.691 --> 03:11.893
I got to get back to work,
actually. Yeah.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.795
Ah. But patience
is waiting, my friend.

03:13.828 --> 03:15.797
What? Uhh.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.297
Mmm.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.467
Patience, by the way......

03:19.500 --> 03:21.469
is disguised laziness.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.237
Oh, no, no, no, no,
not passively waiting.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.808
I mean to keep at it...

03:26.841 --> 03:29.510
when the road is
hard and slow.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.846
That, my friend, is patience.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.947
Oh, great.

03:32.981 --> 03:34.816
For he who is prudent

03:34.849 --> 03:37.518
and lies in wait
for an enemy who is not.

03:37.552 --> 03:39.087
Mm-hmm.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.488
Will be victorious.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.223
- Sun Tzu.
- God bless you.

03:45.026 --> 03:47.327
Ah. Speaking of victorious,

03:47.361 --> 03:48.863
I got deals to close,
all right?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.865
I got a bocce match
with my boss.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.534
I left my card in your shoe.

03:53.568 --> 03:55.503
- Okay. Thank you.
- Come back again

03:55.536 --> 03:57.939
when you're ready
to awaken your chakras.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.710
Today was 225.

04:07.015 --> 04:08.181
That's a lot of money.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.628
We're talking about
balls.

04:20.662 --> 04:21.629
Callahan is calling
McDougal.

04:22.497 --> 04:23.831
Tell him to go to
voicemail.

04:23.865 --> 04:25.867
We got important
business here.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.136
You're wasting your
time with that. Put it away.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.538
Numbers don't lie.
Loser, loser.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.407
Yeah, maybe in bocce,
not where it counts.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.742
I closed two deals
before lunch.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.309
- Just saying.
- That's my ace, bro.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.211
Ha. Thank you, Mr.
Delvecchio.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.014
The old boss man
knows what he's talking about.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.151
I got my balls.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.720
Nothing but balls.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.056
Whoo.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.561
Pa, Wednesdays is for bocce.
You know that.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.696
What's going on?

06:30.792 --> 06:32.426
- Oh, Mick.
- Hey.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.828
Damn good to see you, kid.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.630
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Damn good!

06:35.663 --> 06:37.131
It's like you've been standing
there for 12 years.

06:37.165 --> 06:38.432
You're still a health nut.
I love it.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.934
- Yeah!
- All right.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.836
- Nice talking to you.
- You too, buddy.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.478
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.013
I have been with a loose girl.

06:52.046 --> 06:54.381
Padraig, is that you?

06:55.483 --> 06:58.186
No matter.
Who's this woman you were with?

06:58.219 --> 07:00.688
I'd rather not
ruin a reputation.

07:01.656 --> 07:04.725
Can it possibly have been,
uh, Carla Guatebella?

07:07.662 --> 07:08.729
Brutus ain't cute.

07:08.763 --> 07:11.364
- Father, please.
- Uh

07:11.398 --> 07:13.366
Or Kathy Riley.

07:13.401 --> 07:14.869
I can't say.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.637
Paula Miguele?

07:16.671 --> 07:18.039
My lips are sealed.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.547
Did you get some good
names, huh?

07:27.715 --> 07:28.883
What are you doing?

07:30.350 --> 07:32.086
Yo, look at this guy.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.021
That's a nice outfit.

07:34.055 --> 07:35.523
Men's Wearhouse?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.191
I'm sorry, pal.

07:37.225 --> 07:38.759
Our prodigal son returns.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.731
Hey,
don't pick on him.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.333
He got ambition.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.235
You know why?

07:47.268 --> 07:48.903
He got out.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.972
What the fuck we do
if we got out?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.842
- Good to see you, Coach.
- You too, bud.

07:54.876 --> 07:56.277
- Hey.
- Hmm.

07:57.612 --> 07:59.513
Look at you.
For three fecking days,

07:59.547 --> 08:01.182
trying to get in touch with you.
Three fecking days.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.783
Yeah. I was busy, Pop.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.418
You were busy playing
these Jabroni games,

08:04.452 --> 08:05.853
for Christ's sakes.

08:05.887 --> 08:07.054
You know that if you need
to find me,

08:07.088 --> 08:08.256
just email my assistant.

08:08.289 --> 08:09.557
If I need to f...

08:09.590 --> 08:10.791
I need to find you,

08:10.825 --> 08:11.926
I email your assistant

08:11.959 --> 08:13.227
right up your fancy ass.

08:13.261 --> 08:14.695
- Not today, Pop.
- talk at you.

08:14.729 --> 08:16.097
Not today, okay?

08:16.130 --> 08:17.732
Any other fucking day
but today.

08:19.734 --> 08:20.768
Fair enough.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.178
Come on.

08:32.446 --> 08:33.915
Look at me.
To your mother.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.418
It's good to see you. Hmm?

08:37.451 --> 08:38.753
I'm glad you're here.

08:42.323 --> 08:44.225
- Father, son.
- Mm.

08:44.258 --> 08:46.294
I don't have
that kind of relationship

08:46.327 --> 08:47.328
with my son.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.663
I'm sorry about that.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.065
- He's an asshole.
- I know that.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.367
Now where the hell is that
smack-ass brother of yours?

08:57.872 --> 09:00.441
What the fuck is this?

09:01.609 --> 09:03.311
Whew.

09:22.897 --> 09:24.465
What have we got here.

09:33.207 --> 09:34.208
Schmidt's.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.878
Classy.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.094
Are those for me?

09:54.729 --> 09:55.997
Hey.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.169
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not this time, fucktard.

10:02.203 --> 10:03.738
Doing first driving.
What can you get me for,

10:03.771 --> 10:05.339
idling under the influence?

10:05.373 --> 10:06.674
Yeah. Plus open container

10:06.707 --> 10:08.075
and you're a repeat offender.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.143
How about a weekend
plus points?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.012
No, no, no.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.847
You're looking at some time
in County for this, bitch,

10:12.880 --> 10:14.982
plus court-ordered rehab.

10:15.016 --> 10:16.350
Good times, huh, Dougal?

10:20.855 --> 10:22.390
No, but seriously, though,

10:22.424 --> 10:23.824
the whole point
of this discussion

10:23.858 --> 10:25.059
is that your mother's
a whore.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.260
Come on. Come on.

10:27.962 --> 10:29.296
And speaking of moms

10:30.598 --> 10:32.133
let's go pay yours a visit
at the Bucket.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.337
I'll give you five minutes
to see her out of respect.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.440
You're lucky I'm wearing
these bracelets, pussy pants.

10:38.473 --> 10:39.441
Yeah. Yeah.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.145
You know, Mick, uh

10:47.648 --> 10:48.816
she deserved better.

10:55.556 --> 11:00.361
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let some undertaker

11:00.394 --> 11:02.997
steal two months of my pay.

11:10.405 --> 11:12.373
All right, everyone,

11:12.407 --> 11:13.974
raise a pint.

11:14.008 --> 11:16.777
Let's send my sweet Letitia
off with a toast.

11:18.145 --> 11:22.049
Lying, stealing, cheating,
and drinking.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.485
Hmm?

11:23.518 --> 11:25.653
If you're gonna lie,
lie for a friend.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.288
If you're gonna steal

11:28.823 --> 11:29.857
steal a heart.

11:32.193 --> 11:33.761
If you're gonna cheat,

11:33.794 --> 11:34.962
cheat death.

11:36.465 --> 11:38.467
And if you're gonna drink,

11:38.500 --> 11:41.869
darling, drink with me, hmm?

11:46.807 --> 11:47.875
- Boys.
- Hear, hear.

11:59.887 --> 12:00.988
Five.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.356
Yeah, you weep for my mom,

12:02.389 --> 12:04.493
you curse us Booth hounds

12:04.526 --> 12:07.361
You have that luxury, luxury
of not knowing what I know.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.663
My suspended license,
while tragic,

12:09.697 --> 12:11.098
probably saves lives.

12:11.132 --> 12:12.766
And my existence,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.504
while grotesque
and incomprehensible to you,

12:15.537 --> 12:17.472
saves lives.

12:17.506 --> 12:20.007
I've neither the time
nor inclination

12:20.040 --> 12:23.043
to explain myself
to those pickle smoochers

12:23.077 --> 12:24.479
who sleep under the blanket

12:24.513 --> 12:26.481
of the very inebriation
I provide

12:26.515 --> 12:29.316
and question the manner
in which I provide it.

12:29.350 --> 12:32.153
Come, just say thank you
and be on your fucking way

12:32.186 --> 12:33.888
and buy a round
on your way out!

12:48.035 --> 12:50.037
Oh, hey. Look who showed up.
It's about fucking time.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.906
You don't get
to fucking ruin this.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.707
- You never fucking came.
- She didn't even fucking come!

12:53.741 --> 12:55.376
No, no. It's over. It's over.
You fucking blew it.

12:55.410 --> 12:57.278
You didn't come
while she was alive blew it!

13:01.248 --> 13:03.552
- That was quite the eulogy.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

13:03.585 --> 13:06.353
Welcome back. You gonna
extend your stay a bit little...

13:06.387 --> 13:07.755
Well, I'm out of here ASAP,
all right?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.256
Tell him what he's won, Bob.

13:09.290 --> 13:11.358
Why, it's the keys
to a bankrupt pub.

13:11.392 --> 13:12.527
Bankrupt?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.063
Bankrupt?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.398
What...

13:17.432 --> 13:18.832
What about the hundred large

13:18.866 --> 13:20.834
that I gave Pa to catch you up

13:20.868 --> 13:22.571
'cause you cleaned him out
last time?

13:22.604 --> 13:24.439
What? I went on a bad run.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.273
Don't pretend like you give
a rat's ass about the pub.

13:26.307 --> 13:28.075
It's all about a finder's fee
on that money for you.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.578
I'm not getting caught up
in your shit anymore.

13:29.611 --> 13:31.178
I stayed here long enough.

13:31.212 --> 13:32.614
You got out of here
as soon as you could

13:32.647 --> 13:34.215
with your fancy
Ivy League degree.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.517
Some time back in the Bucket
be good for you,

13:35.550 --> 13:36.884
get some dirt on your dick.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.352
Besides,
who's gonna take care of...

13:38.385 --> 13:40.221
- I already under...
- Hey, hey. Shh.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.489
We can hear you.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.391
You okay?

13:44.426 --> 13:45.826
Yeah. He hits like a girl.

13:51.065 --> 13:52.132
What about her?

13:52.166 --> 13:54.101
Luna? Please.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.438
First off, she's with child,
so show some fucking respect.

13:56.471 --> 13:58.473
Second, she's not exactly
a nurturer.

13:58.506 --> 14:00.307
Well, you thought that one
through, huh?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.388
Still got a thing for her,
huh, Tiny Toon?

14:14.422 --> 14:16.757
You'll be in a pine box like Mom
before you make a move.

14:17.825 --> 14:21.295
Hey, you pissed away
everything that Pop had.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.998
He looks like shit.
We got to put him in a home.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.267
Only if we can collect
his Social Security checks.

14:27.001 --> 14:29.236
Seville, is she rubbing
her belly at me?

14:29.270 --> 14:31.105
Disgusting. Disrespectful.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.675
Stop. Leave her alone.
She's a pregnant woman, Whitey.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.042
What the fuck's wrong
with you?

14:37.512 --> 14:39.046
How do we know
you're pregnant?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.983
Thank God his mom died.

14:43.017 --> 14:44.586
This is gonna save my ass
this month.

14:44.619 --> 14:46.186
- Huh?
- Got my eye

14:46.220 --> 14:47.988
on like three of his clients
already.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.626
His mom's gonna help me
make quota.

14:51.660 --> 14:53.160
Jim, can you show
some respect?

14:53.193 --> 14:55.497
I know it sucks.
When my mom died,

14:55.530 --> 14:57.465
most said the same to me.

14:57.499 --> 14:59.300
Just paying it forward.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.803
Stuffed in there
like a cannoli.

15:02.836 --> 15:05.339
She ain't stuffed in there.
She's comfortable,

15:05.372 --> 15:07.207
like a bed, hmm?

15:07.241 --> 15:09.009
It looks tight.

15:09.043 --> 15:10.844
It looks a little tight,
like he stuffed her in there.

15:10.878 --> 15:12.046
Yeah, I know it is.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.316
Shh.

15:17.519 --> 15:19.621
She caught me
with both her sons.

15:19.654 --> 15:21.355
Never told my mother.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.458
She made the best baked ziti.

15:23.491 --> 15:25.292
Yeah.

15:25.326 --> 15:27.227
If you ever need
a babysitter

15:28.596 --> 15:29.731
I'm good.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.234
Time's up, guys.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.337
You'll get him back
in the morning.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.739
My condolences
about your mother,

15:37.772 --> 15:39.541
and your brother and

15:41.375 --> 15:42.410
condition.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.515
Sorry to jam you up, big bro.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.762
Go, go, go!

16:01.395 --> 16:02.863
That your boy, Saville?

16:02.896 --> 16:05.065
- Uh-huh.
- Good seed you got there.

16:05.099 --> 16:06.300
Look at this.

16:09.937 --> 16:11.905
Not putting up with your shit
no more.

16:11.939 --> 16:13.140
Anymore.

16:14.576 --> 16:16.176
What are you doing?
Get in the car.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.311
Anymore.

16:23.785 --> 16:26.086
- Uh-huh.
- Can you see through the cocks?

16:27.655 --> 16:29.123
Shit.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.058
A cop getting cock-blocked.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.728
Yeah, good shit.

16:33.762 --> 16:36.498
Just back up just directly
through the cocks.

16:37.832 --> 16:38.999
Just play through.

16:54.582 --> 16:56.551
He faked your
illness. And look here.

16:56.584 --> 16:59.554
He faked your signature
on the show-house lease.

16:59.587 --> 17:03.056
There. Another one
of your brother's scams?

17:03.090 --> 17:04.559
Hmm?

17:04.592 --> 17:05.660
Christ.

17:05.693 --> 17:06.795
Hmm.

17:07.796 --> 17:10.063
Pops, slow down.
You know what?

17:10.097 --> 17:12.734
We should talk about
a retirement home.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.670
We should also talk about you
minding your manners.

17:15.703 --> 17:17.304
First you just get here,

17:17.337 --> 17:19.139
and you're just looking
to run me off.

17:19.173 --> 17:20.274
- No, I'm not...
- What the hell's

17:20.307 --> 17:21.341
the matter with you?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.477
There's nothing wrong...

17:22.510 --> 17:23.511
Mr. Delvecchio.

17:23.545 --> 17:24.945
Wasn't expecting you.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.181
Welcome. Good to see you.
Thank you.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.416
My condolences.

17:28.450 --> 17:29.818
- Thank you.
- You know.

17:29.851 --> 17:31.453
This is my father,
by the way.

17:31.486 --> 17:33.987
- My condolences, sir.
- The boss man.

17:34.021 --> 17:36.023
I mean, you're my top gun.
I couldn't just phone it in.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.025
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Come by and say hello.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.461
Uh, sorry.

17:39.494 --> 17:41.094
Yeah.
Can we get you something?

17:41.128 --> 17:43.798
Uh, give me a whiskey.
When in Rome.

17:43.832 --> 17:45.032
All right.

17:47.402 --> 17:48.837
First time here.

17:48.870 --> 17:50.370
Yeah, I got the mortgage
on this place

17:50.405 --> 17:51.338
ever since I gave you
that hundred K.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.274
- Yeah.
- Pretty fucking underwhelming.

17:54.308 --> 17:57.010
Well,
whiskey and water.

17:57.044 --> 17:58.613
There you go.
None of that proddy shit.

17:58.646 --> 18:00.113
There you go.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.381
Hey, what do you know
about yachts?

18:01.416 --> 18:02.550
He knows crab boats.

18:02.584 --> 18:04.351
Yeah. I do know crab boats,

18:04.384 --> 18:06.654
but it's always been
on my to-do list, absolutely.

18:06.688 --> 18:08.890
- What do you got?
- I just purchased a small one.

18:08.923 --> 18:10.525
- 48-footer.
- Oh, yeah?

18:10.558 --> 18:12.527
Don't know what to do
with the other one.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.061
Huh.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.830
- The other one?
- But you know, listen,

18:15.864 --> 18:17.331
I know you got
your family obligations.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.900
I mean,
you just buried her and all.

18:18.933 --> 18:21.301
Buried her and all?
Ya fecking stroker!

18:21.335 --> 18:22.804
Pops, he didn't mean anything.

18:22.837 --> 18:24.204
It's my fucking wife,
you fucking cunt!

18:24.238 --> 18:25.473
Take it easy, Pops.
He didn't...

18:25.507 --> 18:27.341
This is who you're lying with?

18:27.374 --> 18:28.510
No, no.
He didn't mean anything.

18:28.543 --> 18:30.645
No disrespect. All right?

18:30.678 --> 18:31.713
Fucking prick.

18:33.448 --> 18:35.683
Well, that didn't
go over well.

18:37.017 --> 18:38.686
- He's, you know...
- Cunt!

18:42.022 --> 18:43.591
Well, I got good news
for you anyway.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.160
This baby's for you.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.162
Top Performer
four out of six quarters.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.265
And that's
quite an accomplishment.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.600
Thank you.

18:52.634 --> 18:54.201
You're quite welcome.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.670
Water?

18:55.703 --> 18:57.405
You can take the boy
out of Darby,

18:57.438 --> 18:59.507
but you can't take Darby
out of the boy, huh?

18:59.541 --> 19:00.942
Yeah. Darby Heights.

19:00.975 --> 19:03.011
Well, whatever.

19:03.043 --> 19:04.779
You know,
it's a goddamn shame

19:04.812 --> 19:06.781
I'm gonna have to scrap
this casino project.

19:06.814 --> 19:08.248
Why?

19:08.282 --> 19:09.784
'Cause I can't get
the signatures.

19:09.817 --> 19:11.419
I can get signatures.

19:11.452 --> 19:13.253
These Darby rats have a lot
more backbone

19:13.287 --> 19:14.789
than you think.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.891
Look, I know them, all right?

19:16.925 --> 19:18.560
I speak their language.

19:18.593 --> 19:20.360
Speak their language.

19:20.394 --> 19:22.030
They couldn't pour water
out of a boot

19:22.062 --> 19:24.298
if there were instructions
on the heel.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.434
Listen, right now
you're not gonna find

19:26.467 --> 19:29.136
a gaggle of brain surgeons
coming out of Darby Heights.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.572
- I get it.
- Oh, no shit.

19:30.605 --> 19:31.906
But you got to realize

19:31.940 --> 19:33.942
this is a golden opportunity.

19:35.810 --> 19:39.112
You get this done,
no more crab boats.

19:39.146 --> 19:41.081
And I'll make you my partner.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.654
A casino in Darby Heights.

19:46.688 --> 19:48.957
- Win-win.
- Everybody wins.

19:48.990 --> 19:50.324
Sláinte.

20:28.195 --> 20:30.598
Ma! The door!

20:30.632 --> 20:33.801
Go answer it!
What am I, the fucking butler?

20:33.835 --> 20:35.603
Jimmy, don't try to kick
your brother.

20:35.637 --> 20:38.171
For Christ's sakes, Thomas,
put down the scissors.

20:39.373 --> 20:41.876
Who the fuck is at the door?

20:41.909 --> 20:44.512
- Hi.
- What the fuck now, Ali?

20:44.545 --> 20:47.048
Tell your daddy that sending
his daughter to collect the rent

20:47.081 --> 20:49.316
beats the constable,
but not today, hon.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.488
Carla, will you
just talk to me?

20:53.521 --> 20:54.989
- Talk to you?
- Yeah.

20:55.023 --> 20:56.491
What the fuck
we gonna talk about?

20:56.524 --> 20:57.525
Croquet?

21:01.562 --> 21:03.064
Hey, hey!
Hey, come here.

21:03.998 --> 21:05.533
What are you doing?

21:05.566 --> 21:07.367
Think the world is your toilet,
Spanky?

21:07.402 --> 21:08.736
- This yours?
- Yeah.

21:08.770 --> 21:11.005
You know
how to throw a cutter?

21:11.039 --> 21:12.372
No, not really.

21:12.407 --> 21:14.241
It's like a four-seamer,

21:14.274 --> 21:16.243
except you just slightly off
a little bit.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.310
- Got it.
- Go down there.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.513
I'll throw it to you.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.184
Got to remember
to breathe, right?

21:24.217 --> 21:25.352
- Yeah.
- And you want to hide

21:25.385 --> 21:26.821
what you're gonna throw.

21:26.854 --> 21:29.991
So you give it a little kick,
and then

21:30.024 --> 21:30.825
Yeah.

21:30.858 --> 21:34.062
Booyah! Ah. Fuck me.

21:34.095 --> 21:35.997
Aw.

21:36.030 --> 21:39.901
It's okay, Sharona.

21:39.934 --> 21:40.968
Take this.

21:42.570 --> 21:44.237
What the fuck is this?

21:44.271 --> 21:45.606
Look, Ali, you're a doll,

21:45.640 --> 21:48.443
but I don't need your pity
or pita.

21:48.476 --> 21:51.112
It's good, okay?

21:51.145 --> 21:52.279
It's for you.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.715
Sharona?

21:53.748 --> 21:56.084
Yeah. I made her
listen to the Clash.

21:56.117 --> 21:57.785
Calms her down.

21:57.819 --> 21:59.721
I think you're
thinking of the Knack.

22:01.122 --> 22:03.024
Yeah. I don't know about that.

22:03.057 --> 22:05.358
I do.
The Knack song that song.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.562
Uh, uh, okay.

22:07.595 --> 22:11.099
Uh, thank you, but I'm more
of a Sunday gravy gal.

22:12.433 --> 22:14.234
Will you just eat it?

22:14.267 --> 22:15.268
Take it.

22:21.509 --> 22:23.644
- Thank you.
- Bye.

22:23.678 --> 22:25.278
I'll be back soon, okay?

22:27.982 --> 22:30.250
Aw. Look what we got.

22:30.283 --> 22:31.919
Look what we got.

22:31.953 --> 22:33.588
That's right, Sharona.

22:36.124 --> 22:37.558
There you go.

22:37.592 --> 22:40.495
Whoo. Better watch out
for that cutter.

22:40.528 --> 22:43.164
- It's a fickle gal.
- Yeah.

22:43.197 --> 22:44.966
You know that Sam Nahem
discovered that pitch

22:44.999 --> 22:46.801
- on accident?
- Really?

22:46.834 --> 22:49.302
Mm-hmm.
Yep. He couldn't eliminate

22:49.336 --> 22:51.672
the unpredictability
of his fast ball,

22:51.706 --> 22:54.274
so he accepted
his imperfections.

22:54.307 --> 22:56.744
I don't know if I believe
in accidental success.

22:56.778 --> 22:58.946
- Really?
- Sorry. That usually comes

22:58.980 --> 23:00.448
from a lot of hard work
and focus.

23:00.481 --> 23:02.016
- Right.
- And I don't buy that whole

23:02.049 --> 23:03.985
Millennial stumbling into that
bullshit.

23:04.018 --> 23:05.653
Well, good luck with that.

23:05.686 --> 23:07.522
What's so funny?

23:09.322 --> 23:10.758
- Was he
- He's

23:10.792 --> 23:13.094
- Oh, wow.
- Having some accidental success.

23:13.127 --> 23:15.029
Kukla!

23:15.062 --> 23:16.864
Where are those dolmades?

23:16.898 --> 23:18.466
Yes, I...

23:18.499 --> 23:20.635
I'll be right there!

23:22.236 --> 23:24.138
At least she doesn't
have to go shopping

23:24.172 --> 23:25.606
for my ma's funeral.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.141
- What? It's a good...
- She loves black.

23:27.175 --> 23:28.843
I know it's a good
funeral muumuu.

23:28.876 --> 23:30.011
- Stop.
- It's exciting.

23:30.044 --> 23:31.612
I'm all she's got.

23:31.646 --> 23:33.948
You're so mean.

23:33.981 --> 23:35.183
Hey, how are you feeling?

23:35.216 --> 23:36.551
Hope you're feeling better.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.319
No, I'm serious.

23:39.352 --> 23:41.455
I'm really sorry. Okay?

23:41.489 --> 23:42.490
Give me a hug.

23:44.258 --> 23:45.392
- Tighter.
- Mm.

23:45.426 --> 23:47.295
Squeeze me.

23:47.327 --> 23:48.563
All right.
Well, I better get going.

23:48.596 --> 23:49.730
- All right.
- See you soon.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.100
I'm coming.

23:55.703 --> 23:58.005
Hello, Mr. Gerald Murphy.

23:58.039 --> 24:00.340
Yes. This is Dr. Narzikul
calling

24:00.373 --> 24:02.176
about your daughter's
test results.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.478
Uh, in any case,
she was negative

24:04.512 --> 24:08.015
for gonorrhea, chlamydia,
herpes.

24:08.049 --> 24:09.382
<i>I swear to God...</i>

24:09.417 --> 24:10.918
I do not think
you understand.

24:10.952 --> 24:13.187
Negative is good news,
very good news.

24:13.221 --> 24:15.656
She can continue to be
quite active sexually

24:15.690 --> 24:18.391
with no worries,
no worries whatsoever.

24:18.426 --> 24:21.162
Still pulling that Kiddie City
shit, huh, Seven-up?

24:21.195 --> 24:23.331
I thought you'd grow up
by now.

24:23.363 --> 24:25.733
What, like you?
Big shot.

24:25.766 --> 24:27.602
He's the best in the Heights.

24:27.635 --> 24:29.203
Whitey ex-chick cheated.

24:29.237 --> 24:30.705
He's looking
to settle the score.

24:30.738 --> 24:33.574
- Yeah.
- Hey. There's my man.

24:33.608 --> 24:35.576
I thought you pulled
an Irish exit.

24:35.610 --> 24:37.511
Oh, please.

24:37.545 --> 24:39.647
You raised a better lad
than that.

24:41.215 --> 24:42.783
I'm done today, guys.

24:44.652 --> 24:46.854
- See you, Coach.
- And I will be back,

24:46.888 --> 24:49.123
especially to look at you.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.791
- Good night, Pop.
- Look at you.

24:50.825 --> 24:53.294
- Have a good day.
- With your hands clasped

24:53.327 --> 24:55.730
like a little fucking
choir boy.

24:55.763 --> 24:57.465
I just had confession today.

24:57.498 --> 24:59.433
You know, if you leave them
like that,

24:59.467 --> 25:02.904
people might think
you have a shot at a life.

25:02.937 --> 25:05.139
But if you... That a boy.

25:05.172 --> 25:07.642
Now you may look for a life,

25:07.675 --> 25:09.277
but you'll never get one.

25:12.079 --> 25:13.114
Good night, Pop.

25:13.915 --> 25:15.316
He's in a good mood today.

25:15.349 --> 25:18.219
It's good to have you
around, son.

25:18.252 --> 25:21.656
Good to be back with all this
positive reinforcement.

25:21.689 --> 25:23.557
You know what?
I got to get out of here.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.760
What the fuck you got
to get to, bitch? Glenn Wyn?

25:25.793 --> 25:27.395
Why you have to move
so far away?

25:27.428 --> 25:29.563
I live in Rittenhouse Square,
by the way.

25:29.597 --> 25:31.832
- What is this?
- What is that, North Jersey?

25:31.866 --> 25:33.301
No, it's like ten minutes
from here.

25:33.334 --> 25:35.269
It might as well be Georgia,
hot shot.

25:35.303 --> 25:36.971
I forgot. You guys
break out in hives

25:37.004 --> 25:38.472
if you have to leave
the Heights.

25:38.506 --> 25:40.908
No reason to leave except
if you go to...

25:40.942 --> 25:42.143
The shore.

25:42.176 --> 25:43.644
You guys are unbelievable.

25:43.678 --> 25:45.479
You know, the stakes
are much higher

25:45.513 --> 25:46.914
when you're adults,
you know?

25:46.948 --> 25:48.449
You have to pay bills.

25:48.482 --> 25:50.017
- You have to live in reality.
- Oh.

25:50.051 --> 25:51.786
You don't have your dads
wiping your ass for you.

25:51.819 --> 25:53.854
Charlie's out there
directing imaginary traffic,

25:53.888 --> 25:56.190
chomping on a cigar
like a truffle pig.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.792
You're not wearing...
look at you guys.

25:57.825 --> 25:59.260
Fucking... It's like
you've been shellacked

25:59.293 --> 26:01.028
since... in 1997.

26:01.062 --> 26:02.930
You're in a fucking
time capsule.

26:02.964 --> 26:04.665
Come on.
Hang with your boys.

26:04.699 --> 26:06.435
- I don't...
- Hang with your boys tonight.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.002
- Yeah, we'll have a good time.
- I don't... Listen,

26:08.035 --> 26:09.470
I know this is hard
for you guys

26:09.503 --> 26:10.705
- to wrap your mind around...
- Fuck.

26:10.738 --> 26:12.306
but I have a job, all right?

26:12.340 --> 26:13.674
Besides, I don't drink
the way I used to.

26:13.708 --> 26:15.444
Well, neither do we.

26:15.476 --> 26:17.178
Yo, remember that night
we jumped them Hammers?

26:17.211 --> 26:18.679
- Of course.
- Don't you want

26:18.713 --> 26:20.481
to get your fucking
dukes up again?

26:20.514 --> 26:22.316
Come on, man. I bet the only
fighting this guy does

26:22.350 --> 26:24.118
is on the email.

26:24.151 --> 26:25.720
Too cool.

26:25.753 --> 26:27.488
I am a keyboard warrior.

26:27.521 --> 26:29.390
But I can still kick ass.
Don't worry about it.

26:29.424 --> 26:31.125
You do Krav Maga?

26:31.158 --> 26:32.293
The Israeli fighting system?

26:32.326 --> 26:33.462
- Yeah.
- What do you know

26:33.494 --> 26:35.062
about Krav Maga, man bun?

26:35.096 --> 26:36.564
Oh, you're looking
like you do,

26:36.597 --> 26:38.032
so, like, when you left,
I'm wondering...

26:38.065 --> 26:39.533
You working out now?

26:39.567 --> 26:41.403
if you went
a little bagel on it.

26:41.436 --> 26:44.071
You went a little bagel schmear
fighting style, right?

26:44.105 --> 26:45.673
Oh, you guys
are fucking unbelievable.

26:45.706 --> 26:47.708
- Oh, come on.
- Rolls up after bench.

26:47.742 --> 26:50.978
He presses fucking 185.
Has a blueberry smoothie.

26:52.747 --> 26:54.348
Fucking guys...

26:55.783 --> 26:57.318
You're fucking unbelievable,
man.

26:57.351 --> 26:58.886
- Yeah.
- You guys are the grand poobahs

26:58.919 --> 27:01.055
of a tragedy festival.
You really are.

27:01.088 --> 27:02.890
- Ohh.
- It's making me fucking sad.

27:02.923 --> 27:04.692
Why don't you hang out
with my dad

27:04.725 --> 27:06.327
for a little while? You guys
would get along great.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.528
- Any one of your boys.
- Yeah.

27:07.561 --> 27:09.330
Any one of your finance boys.

27:09.363 --> 27:12.333
- We'll get on the ground.
- Don't leave! Don't leave!

27:12.366 --> 27:13.601
- Fucking Iowa.
- There we go.

27:13.634 --> 27:15.202
I don't know what Iowa said.

27:15.236 --> 27:16.937
she said this fucking guy.

27:18.473 --> 27:19.740
- Oh, my God.
- Can you believe...

27:19.774 --> 27:21.242
You went to Catholic school.

27:21.275 --> 27:22.576
So, you know,
same with a preschool.

27:22.610 --> 27:23.778
You looked down,

27:23.811 --> 27:25.079
and you saw the Adam's apple.

27:25.112 --> 27:26.680
- No!
- And then you decided

27:26.714 --> 27:29.250
and you said,
"Finish the job."

27:29.283 --> 27:31.585
- And then...
- I hate you all!

27:31.619 --> 27:33.054
I'm so... I love you guys.

27:33.087 --> 27:34.789
You should take a...

27:34.822 --> 27:36.390
This guy's got
a fucking Porsche.

27:36.425 --> 27:38.559
- No!
- He's fucked up. He's living.

27:38.592 --> 27:39.860
- Yeah.
- That's...

27:39.894 --> 27:41.530
What are you two fucking
driving?

27:41.562 --> 27:43.130
- What are you fucking...
- I got a Pontiac...

27:43.164 --> 27:45.366
Hey!

27:45.399 --> 27:46.901
Hey!

27:54.775 --> 27:55.943
Stop drinking, man.

27:55.976 --> 27:57.778
Ah!

27:57.812 --> 28:00.081
- God bless you.
- You're not gonna put your...

28:00.114 --> 28:01.148
If he put his mouth on the...

28:01.182 --> 28:02.950
He put his mouth on it.

28:02.983 --> 28:04.151
I'll kick the shit
out of you.

28:05.753 --> 28:07.655
I go there for effect.

28:07.688 --> 28:09.323
Gonorrhea?

28:09.356 --> 28:10.425
Fellas, don't worry about it.

28:12.827 --> 28:14.095
Hold on.

28:14.128 --> 28:15.262
- Oh, are you okay?
- Jesus.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.449
Ohh.

28:58.038 --> 28:59.508
<i>To Laurence Sr.</i>

28:59.541 --> 29:01.842
<i>I bequeath all of my jewelry.</i>

29:01.876 --> 29:05.012
<i>Laurence Jr. insisted he be
mentioned in my will,</i>

29:05.045 --> 29:06.881
<i>so hi, Junior.</i>

29:06.914 --> 29:10.151
<i>To Seamus I bequeath
Callahan's Irish Pub,</i>

29:10.184 --> 29:11.886
<i>and please take care
of your father</i>

29:11.919 --> 29:13.622
<i>because we both know
that man's incapable</i>

29:13.687 --> 29:15.189
<i>of looking after himself.</i>

29:15.222 --> 29:16.525
<i>He couldn't even piss
on himself</i>

29:16.558 --> 29:17.992
<i>if he was on fire.</i>

29:37.211 --> 29:39.380
How do you have
a place called Bucky

29:39.414 --> 29:41.516
and have fucking
invitation crap?

29:44.218 --> 29:46.020
You know,
our crab boat's broken.

29:46.053 --> 29:49.190
Yeah, you can fucking
put crabs on anything.

29:54.028 --> 29:55.863
I can't tell you, I can't
wait for Memorial Day weekend

29:55.896 --> 29:57.398
down at the shore.

29:57.432 --> 29:59.266
Youse have no idea
what I got planned,

29:59.300 --> 30:01.235
a little pre-sentencing
celebration.

30:01.268 --> 30:02.903
Let's go, slackers. Come on.

30:02.937 --> 30:05.407
You'll be late for work.
You've got tabs to pay.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.907
Right?

30:06.941 --> 30:08.742
I need your John Hancock
right here,

30:08.776 --> 30:10.512
if you will for me, fellas.

30:10.545 --> 30:12.681
- What?
- It's some petition

30:12.713 --> 30:14.683
for some construction
in the neighborhood.

30:14.715 --> 30:16.717
You're fixing up the hood,
Mickey?

30:16.750 --> 30:18.385
That's right, Paddy.

30:18.420 --> 30:20.387
Where is he?

30:20.422 --> 30:22.156
In his office as always.

30:28.663 --> 30:30.064
He's got a fucking home.

30:36.737 --> 30:38.205
Booyah!

30:57.992 --> 30:59.661
A little early for that,
don't you think, Pops?

30:59.694 --> 31:02.029
Ah.
Never too early.

31:03.665 --> 31:05.332
You get some crab and eggs?

31:05.366 --> 31:10.004
Yeah. It's, uh, lipstick
on a pig, don't you think?

31:16.711 --> 31:18.345
Thanks for the grub, though.

31:19.481 --> 31:20.781
I need a decent boat,

31:20.814 --> 31:22.850
and blue freshies
are out there.

31:22.883 --> 31:24.852
They're just further south.

31:24.885 --> 31:27.021
The crabs are jumping
into the boat down there.

31:27.054 --> 31:29.156
Yeah, you know, I'll help you
this weekend, Pops.

31:29.189 --> 31:31.158
- We'll get ready for this.
- Yeah, sure.

31:31.191 --> 31:33.093
You say that every year,

31:33.127 --> 31:35.963
ah, but you're still working
for that yuppie prick, hmm?

31:35.996 --> 31:37.532
You're gonna help me
with the boat.

31:37.565 --> 31:39.434
You're gonna
help me with the pub

31:39.467 --> 31:41.636
that was good to your family
for all these generations.

31:41.670 --> 31:45.873
My son, my Cain,
can't help himself, hmm?

31:45.906 --> 31:47.975
And then throwing it all
away.

31:48.008 --> 31:49.810
Life's just a big party, huh?

31:49.843 --> 31:51.312
- I'm here.
- Yeah.

31:51.345 --> 31:52.580
You're here now.

31:53.648 --> 31:55.650
The question is why. Hmm?

31:55.684 --> 31:56.817
Why?

31:58.986 --> 32:01.322
You were born with a horseshoe
up your ass.

32:01.355 --> 32:02.856
And don't start that shite

32:02.890 --> 32:04.559
about putting me
into an old age home.

32:04.592 --> 32:06.193
I ain't going nowhere.

32:09.096 --> 32:10.898
Go. I got work to do.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.500
I don't want you to get dirty.

32:38.258 --> 32:39.927
- Ooh!
- Ooh! God damn it!

32:39.960 --> 32:41.830
Strike three! You're out!

32:41.862 --> 32:43.297
Where's my money?

32:44.699 --> 32:45.834
What's this?

32:45.866 --> 32:46.867
Candy.

33:13.495 --> 33:16.897
She's sick.

33:16.930 --> 33:19.601
I just need
one goddamn leprechaun.

33:21.403 --> 33:23.872
Well, well, well,

33:23.904 --> 33:26.373
look what the tide washed in.

33:26.408 --> 33:27.776
- It's unbelievable.
- I know.

33:27.809 --> 33:29.711
It's like a time capsule.

33:29.744 --> 33:31.078
- Hey, Mick.
- Yeah.

33:31.111 --> 33:32.379
If you're looking
for your cream,

33:32.414 --> 33:34.248
you know, for your issues,

33:34.281 --> 33:36.049
got to go down
to the pharmacy.

33:36.083 --> 33:37.619
That's where I get it.

33:37.652 --> 33:38.820
Yeah. That's great, Charlie.
Thank you.

33:38.853 --> 33:40.220
The only issues I have

33:40.254 --> 33:42.256
is with you using
all the cream.

33:42.289 --> 33:43.892
It's a terrible image.
You look amazing, Melanie.

33:43.924 --> 33:45.159
- Yes. Thank you.
- No, but you are.

33:45.192 --> 33:46.927
- And... And...
- You think so?

33:46.960 --> 33:48.763
Well, you could use
some more customers, though.

33:48.797 --> 33:50.063
- Oh?
- I have some suggestions.

33:50.097 --> 33:51.932
Yeah? I'm worried about you.

33:51.965 --> 33:53.435
- You're worried about me?
- Yeah.

33:53.468 --> 33:55.269
Dougal's concerned
about your health.

33:55.302 --> 33:57.070
He's raising money
for your issues.

33:57.104 --> 33:58.673
The only thing
that he's concerned about

33:58.706 --> 34:01.074
is funding his endless summer,
believe me.

34:01.108 --> 34:02.142
- So listen.
- Mm-hmm.

34:02.176 --> 34:03.812
I need your signature

34:03.845 --> 34:05.914
'cause I need to bring
more jobs to the area.

34:05.946 --> 34:08.248
- Wait. The casino?
- Absolutely.

34:08.282 --> 34:10.485
More traffic for the hood
means more patrons for you.

34:10.518 --> 34:12.687
- You're gonna make more money.
- They're gonna shop here?

34:12.720 --> 34:14.622
Are you kidding me?
Listen.

34:14.656 --> 34:16.524
You keep making
those empanadas.

34:16.558 --> 34:17.759
How can they refuse?

34:17.792 --> 34:18.827
Are you kidding me?

34:18.860 --> 34:20.027
You deserve it.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.529
I dreamed... It's comfort food.

34:21.563 --> 34:23.631
- Okay. Just for you.
- Thank you.

34:23.665 --> 34:25.767
- This signature means the most.
- I missed you.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.267
Oh, I missed you.
Take care of yourself.

34:27.301 --> 34:28.937
- Thank you.
- Keep up the good work.

34:28.969 --> 34:30.638
- No empanadas?
- Not now.

34:38.378 --> 34:41.114
Hey, Mrs. Ning,
how are you?

34:41.148 --> 34:44.151
I'm good, sir.
Do we know each other?

34:44.184 --> 34:46.119
Yes, of course we do.
It's Mick.

34:46.153 --> 34:48.055
- Who?
- From Callahan's. Remember?

34:48.088 --> 34:50.123
We have the pub
down the street.

34:50.157 --> 34:52.125
Oh, yes.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.161
The McDagos.

34:54.194 --> 34:56.330
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Oh.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.703
What? What do you got?

35:02.904 --> 35:04.405
Casino? I'm not interested.

35:04.439 --> 35:06.039
Get the fuck out of here.

35:07.274 --> 35:09.343
- How old are you now?
- I'm in my 40s,

35:09.376 --> 35:10.411
you know, just like you.

35:11.913 --> 35:13.848
Always a charmer.

35:15.917 --> 35:18.620
This used to be McDermott's
or Flannigan's house.

35:19.186 --> 35:20.855
Hey. You looking to get in?

35:20.889 --> 35:22.557
Yeah. Are these new condos?

35:22.590 --> 35:24.258
Uh, yeah.
They built them last fall.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.727
The joint is sick, right?

35:25.760 --> 35:27.261
I have no idea
what you just said,

35:27.294 --> 35:29.497
but do you mind signing?

35:29.531 --> 35:30.932
Yeah, I can get the whole
complex to sign those.

35:30.965 --> 35:31.933
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:31.966 --> 35:33.501
I'd love that.

35:33.535 --> 35:35.235
Now you don't have to take
the bus into AC.

35:35.269 --> 35:37.037
Oh, not with those nasty nuns.

35:37.070 --> 35:39.039
Oh, man, I still have
nightmares about those nuns.

35:39.072 --> 35:41.341
They stuck an entire ruler
up my ass.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.276
- Yeah.
- Yeah. They used me

35:42.309 --> 35:43.778
as a hand puppet.

35:43.811 --> 35:46.146
- I hate nuns.
- Oh, I hate them too.

35:53.086 --> 35:54.556
Yo, come here, guy.

36:05.299 --> 36:07.635
The Mick I remember
would never pass by the house

36:07.669 --> 36:08.803
without saying hello.

36:08.836 --> 36:10.405
Hello, Mrs. C.

36:10.438 --> 36:11.906
- How are you, Mick?
- Good. How are you?

36:11.940 --> 36:13.373
Would you care for a cookie?

36:13.408 --> 36:15.309
Oh, sweet of you.
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

36:20.815 --> 36:22.984
Iceberg straight ahead.

36:23.017 --> 36:24.686
So how you feeling?

36:25.753 --> 36:26.888
I'm all right.

36:26.921 --> 36:29.389
I heard you have this, um

36:29.424 --> 36:32.125
uh, elongated illness?

36:32.159 --> 36:33.595
No, no, no. I'm fine, really.

36:33.628 --> 36:35.730
Oh. Your dad?

36:35.763 --> 36:37.065
Brother, they have?

36:37.097 --> 36:38.499
Still shanty Irish.

36:38.533 --> 36:39.701
Oh.

36:40.835 --> 36:43.438
I ever show you a picture
of my Kukla?

36:43.471 --> 36:46.741
Yes. Yes. Many times.
Many times.

36:46.774 --> 36:48.676
- Beautiful, huh?
- Yeah.

36:48.710 --> 36:50.110
- Yeah.
- Bye.

36:54.048 --> 36:56.818
Is that Laurence McDougal Jr.?

37:06.794 --> 37:08.463
You look like a bag of ass.

37:08.496 --> 37:10.297
Still building tomorrow's
ghettos today, champion?

37:10.330 --> 37:12.100
All the way to the bank,
junior.

37:12.132 --> 37:13.935
By the way, guys,

37:13.968 --> 37:16.404
I'm hiring douchebags
who'll do anything for money.

37:18.006 --> 37:19.574
No, no, no, no, no.

37:21.009 --> 37:22.744
Oh, uh, I got something
for you.

37:25.847 --> 37:27.782
Yeah, that's funny.
That's funny.

37:27.815 --> 37:29.784
- Keep it up, junior.
- I will.

37:29.817 --> 37:31.351
Asshole.

37:35.389 --> 37:36.958
- She's a beauty.
- Absolutely.

37:36.991 --> 37:38.358
She has these great
child-bearing hips.

37:38.392 --> 37:39.661
She gets that from me.

37:40.762 --> 37:42.897
Yaya, gosh.

37:42.930 --> 37:44.164
- See you later.
- Bye.

37:44.197 --> 37:45.533
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

37:48.436 --> 37:50.505
Don't do that.

37:50.538 --> 37:52.674
What? What I do now?

37:57.445 --> 38:00.014
Still ain't made your move
on Persephone over there, huh?

38:01.416 --> 38:03.084
Some things never change,
pussy.

38:03.117 --> 38:04.217
I know this look.

38:04.251 --> 38:05.853
Which look?

38:05.887 --> 38:08.589
His look when he looks at you.
I know this.

38:08.623 --> 38:10.257
Yeah, he is pretty cute, huh?

38:10.290 --> 38:12.827
- Mm-hmm.
- But he's so into himself.

38:12.860 --> 38:14.227
He's a waste of time.

38:16.196 --> 38:17.565
He's Mick.

38:17.598 --> 38:20.101
He has.

38:20.134 --> 38:22.170
Not like your father. Uch.

38:22.202 --> 38:23.203
<i>Palaka.</i>

38:24.539 --> 38:26.206
- Ai.
- You're fine.

38:26.239 --> 38:28.042
Come, come. I'll go make
some , huh?

38:28.076 --> 38:29.877
- Ooh. Yes.
- Okay.

38:29.911 --> 38:32.113
- I'll help you.
- Thank you, Kukla. Ai!

38:32.146 --> 38:34.549
How was your day?

38:34.582 --> 38:38.786
It was a day, another day.
Thank God it's over.

38:38.820 --> 38:40.888
Ai. What the fuck.

38:42.457 --> 38:43.958
Hey, no. Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

38:43.991 --> 38:45.426
- Where are we going?
- Hold on a second.

38:45.460 --> 38:47.227
It's Friday!

38:47.260 --> 38:49.362
No, wait a minute. Hold on.
I got to check on Pop.

38:49.396 --> 38:50.965
I already did.
He's holding down the fort.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.500
Time for a day load.

39:09.984 --> 39:11.853
Got one?

39:16.323 --> 39:17.725
Looking sharp, Whitey.

39:17.759 --> 39:19.427
- Oh, look.
- You joining us later?

39:19.460 --> 39:21.562
Ah, come on, man.
Does a priest like little boys?

39:21.596 --> 39:22.663
Mm-hmm.

39:23.865 --> 39:25.166
There he is.

39:25.199 --> 39:26.934
Is it a yard sale
Tommy Bahama?

39:26.968 --> 39:28.970
- Yeah.
- Ehh.

39:29.003 --> 39:31.239
- Hey, easy, easy, easy.
- Come on, Whitey.

39:31.271 --> 39:34.108
Hold on, guys.
It's not a gay bar. All right?

39:34.142 --> 39:35.810
We got enough dudes
in there right now.

39:35.843 --> 39:37.310
Are you serious?

39:37.344 --> 39:39.947
We're trying to get
one female in.

39:39.981 --> 39:41.249
Is anybody here female?

39:41.281 --> 39:42.750
He's talking to you.

39:42.784 --> 39:44.252
Is anybody out here
in transition?

39:46.353 --> 39:47.655
Oh, would you look at you?

39:47.688 --> 39:48.956
For fuck's sake, Dougal,

39:48.990 --> 39:50.191
I thought you were flagged.

39:50.224 --> 39:51.759
And I tawt I taw a putty tat.

39:51.793 --> 39:53.795
Medicate us
with a round of car bombs

39:53.828 --> 39:55.663
before I give you a real reason
to like me.

40:09.744 --> 40:10.878
You're a fucking
Muppet.

40:13.581 --> 40:14.749
Excuse me.

40:15.817 --> 40:17.051
- Hey.
- Yes.

40:17.084 --> 40:18.553
- Hey, Mick.
- There he is.

40:18.586 --> 40:19.954
- Long time.
- Yeah.

40:19.987 --> 40:21.522
Hey, apologies.

40:21.556 --> 40:23.291
I sure hope you beat
that hard-on thing.

40:23.323 --> 40:24.959
Must hurt.

40:24.992 --> 40:27.295
Uh, I'm all right. Thank you.
Thanks, buddy.

40:27.327 --> 40:28.629
We didn't know.

40:28.663 --> 40:30.363
No one knows.

40:30.397 --> 40:32.365
Okay what'll it be, then?

40:32.399 --> 40:34.202
We'll take...
I'll take a tall boy.

40:34.235 --> 40:35.837
- Black and tan.
- Couple of car bombs,

40:35.870 --> 40:37.071
tall boy, half and half.

40:37.104 --> 40:38.306
- Coming up.
- Thanks.

40:38.338 --> 40:39.907
- I'm Seamus.
- Morgan.

40:39.941 --> 40:41.542
Basically single.

40:41.576 --> 40:43.244
All right. There you go.
This is my boy Seven-up.

40:43.277 --> 40:44.278
Oh.

40:45.446 --> 40:47.048
Okay. What are you doing?

40:47.081 --> 40:48.716
Easy, guys, okay? Go.

40:48.749 --> 40:51.652
Come on, Grimace.
Take it easy, all right?

40:51.686 --> 40:54.088
So look at this guy.
He got fucking dressed up.

40:54.121 --> 40:56.057
We have a three stain policy.

40:56.090 --> 40:58.159
If you have more than three
stains on your shirt,

40:58.192 --> 40:59.994
you can't get in.
I see three and a half.

41:00.027 --> 41:01.529
- Come on, man.
- Come on, let's get going.

41:01.562 --> 41:02.830
Do you know you're going out
or what?

41:02.864 --> 41:04.265
I can't get anywhere with you.

41:04.298 --> 41:06.267
Guys, you see this?
It's Bill Blass.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.536
- Been waiting for a...
- Go to Men's Wearhouse.

41:08.569 --> 41:10.071
Get yourself something.

41:10.104 --> 41:12.173
He puts out
a beautiful product, okay?

41:15.443 --> 41:16.911
- So
- What in God's name

41:16.944 --> 41:18.446
are you still doing
in the Heights?

41:18.479 --> 41:19.747
- Me?
- Yeah.

41:19.780 --> 41:21.616
I'm staying at Yaya's.

41:21.649 --> 41:24.085
My dad's trying to build her
a in-law suite.

41:24.118 --> 41:26.721
He's trying, but she's
never gonna leave here.

41:26.754 --> 41:28.356
- Why?
- She really... I don't know.

41:28.422 --> 41:29.924
- She just...
- It's a shithole.

41:29.957 --> 41:31.692
It's not a shithole.

41:31.726 --> 41:34.362
It's so not a shithole.
I like it here.

41:34.394 --> 41:37.431
It's special. It's like,
it's nostalgic,

41:37.465 --> 41:39.399
and I don't know.
I like her house.

41:39.433 --> 41:41.369
It smells good.
It's comfortable.

41:41.401 --> 41:43.404
I wish I had a grandma
like that.

41:43.437 --> 41:46.240
You know, she actually
really talks highly about you.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.644
- Really?
- Yeah. Kind of a lot.

41:49.677 --> 41:52.480
She talks about how your mom
used to come by all the time

41:52.513 --> 41:54.148
and brag about your...
your hours

41:54.181 --> 41:55.416
and your promotions,

41:55.449 --> 41:58.185
and she's so... so proud of you.

42:00.187 --> 42:01.789
Hard work, thanks to her.

42:01.822 --> 42:03.724
She thinks you're <i>embeestos.</i>

42:03.758 --> 42:05.092
- <i>Embeestos?</i>
- Yeah.

42:05.126 --> 42:06.460
- What does that mean?
- Noble.

42:06.494 --> 42:07.762
- Noble?
- Thinks you're noble.

42:07.795 --> 42:09.130
Are you noble?

42:10.498 --> 42:12.900
I thought it meant,
like, manly.

42:12.934 --> 42:14.835
- No?
- No.

42:14.869 --> 42:16.337
Doesn't...

42:16.370 --> 42:18.072
She used to take care
of those kids.

42:18.105 --> 42:20.574
She used to feed us.
We loved going over there.

42:20.608 --> 42:22.310
Desserts. Mm.

42:22.343 --> 42:23.444
Spanakopita.

42:23.477 --> 42:25.146
- Spanakopita.
- Mm-hmm.

42:26.180 --> 42:27.214
She's awesome.

42:28.482 --> 42:29.784
Ah.

42:31.953 --> 42:34.322
Not really
what I was expecting.

42:34.355 --> 42:35.990
What were you expecting?

42:36.023 --> 42:38.492
I don't know. I just heard
that you sold out.

42:39.860 --> 42:42.596
Or that you, like, turned
your back on the neighborhood

42:42.630 --> 42:44.031
to make money.

42:45.132 --> 42:46.834
Maybe there's some hope
left in you.

42:46.867 --> 42:48.769
I see it.

42:48.803 --> 42:50.338
I mean, just a little.

42:50.371 --> 42:51.440
- A little bit?
- Just... Yeah.

42:51.472 --> 42:52.506
Just a little crack.

42:52.540 --> 42:53.708
Don't get carried away.

43:02.049 --> 43:03.684
You remember
my brother Dougal.

43:03.718 --> 43:05.286
How could I forget?

43:05.319 --> 43:07.221
You leave such
a indelible impression.

43:07.254 --> 43:08.856
Watch your mouth.

43:08.889 --> 43:10.591
We don't use that kind
of language around here.

43:11.892 --> 43:13.160
Ali. Remember me?

43:13.194 --> 43:15.663
Zafilopoulos.

43:15.696 --> 43:16.998
Yeah, I seen you down the...
There you go.

43:17.031 --> 43:18.532
Good Irish lass.

43:18.566 --> 43:19.834
Her pop Deech
owns half the township.

43:19.867 --> 43:21.335
Him and her boyfriend Steve.

43:21.369 --> 43:23.137
He's not my boyfriend.

43:23.170 --> 43:24.638
Yeah, well, I got this one.

43:24.672 --> 43:25.740
Oh, and another round
of car bombs.

43:25.773 --> 43:27.375
Coming up.

43:27.409 --> 43:29.043
So your pops is
really from Darby Heights?

43:29.076 --> 43:30.811
Yeah, he's really
from Darby Heights.

43:30.845 --> 43:33.047
- Hey, got a problem?
- Think you're funny, faggot?

43:33.080 --> 43:34.483
- Uh
- Easy, guys.

43:34.515 --> 43:36.917
I know you.

43:36.951 --> 43:38.652
Yeah?

43:38.686 --> 43:40.489
That's right.
I met you at the club.

43:40.521 --> 43:42.757
- Country club?
- Tell your boy to cool out.

43:42.790 --> 43:44.258
Chill. It's all right.

43:44.291 --> 43:46.727
- See you at the club.
- All right.

43:46.761 --> 43:48.662
- Ow!
- Faggot here thinks he's funny.

43:48.696 --> 43:50.998
You gonna let him talk like
that around these lovely ladies?

43:51.032 --> 43:52.501
That's not the Mick
I used to know.

43:52.533 --> 43:53.901
Siding with these rich twats?
Come on.

43:53.934 --> 43:55.536
How about we take it outside

43:55.569 --> 43:57.004
and I embarrass you
in front of your bitches?

43:57.038 --> 43:58.873
See, now why'd you
have to go there?

43:58.906 --> 44:00.541
- Don't.
- No, that's all right.

44:00.574 --> 44:02.209
It's all right.
It's all right.

44:02.243 --> 44:03.911
I've been outside before.
Come on, big man.

44:03.944 --> 44:05.346
- Let's go.
- All right.

44:05.379 --> 44:07.181
He's tougher
than he looks, bro.

44:07.214 --> 44:09.750
Hey, why don't you zeroes
stay here and keep me company,

44:09.784 --> 44:11.685
all right? Otherwise, we can
all go back to jail, right?

44:11.719 --> 44:13.220
Unless you think, uh,

44:13.254 --> 44:14.722
Hulk over there can't
handle him, eh?

44:16.491 --> 44:17.892
Can you give this
to your brother?

44:17.925 --> 44:19.627
Thanks.

44:19.660 --> 44:20.728
Another round.

44:21.762 --> 44:23.230
Hot asbestos? What is
that?

44:23.264 --> 44:25.467
Like... Like a...
Like a dirty gyro?

44:25.500 --> 44:27.568
No, Rambo!
It means noble.

44:27.601 --> 44:28.869
It's a kind of cannoli.

44:45.953 --> 44:48.557
I think your boy's gonna
need some help out there.

44:48.589 --> 44:50.758
Aw, look at them run along

44:50.791 --> 44:52.927
with your old asses and elbows
out of here.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.829
He was hungry. I gave him
a three piece and a soda.

44:54.862 --> 44:56.363
Ah, you still got some fight
in you, huh?

44:58.032 --> 44:59.867
What the fuck was that
all about anyway?

45:01.302 --> 45:02.404
Come on. Grab a beer with me.

45:02.437 --> 45:04.071
Oh, look. Oh. Look.

45:04.105 --> 45:06.140
There's the dude she's
doinking right there.

45:06.173 --> 45:07.808
Hey, tooler, are you still
banging Ali Z?

45:07.842 --> 45:09.511
Not anymore, douchel.

45:09.544 --> 45:11.846
Left a bad taste in her mouth.

45:11.879 --> 45:14.583
You got my sloppy seconds,
so I'll get yours.

45:14.615 --> 45:16.117
- Huh?
- I just picked up

45:16.150 --> 45:17.751
the new Meeta project.

45:17.785 --> 45:20.254
Your boss Delvecchio,
I love that fucking guy.

45:20.287 --> 45:21.789
Those for us?

45:21.822 --> 45:23.525
Say,
aren't you going away again?

45:23.558 --> 45:24.559
Yep.

45:25.292 --> 45:27.294
Well, I can no longer
own a firearm,

45:27.328 --> 45:30.197
but on the bright side,
I got out of jury duty.

45:30.231 --> 45:32.601
I think it might be difficult
landing a job.

45:32.633 --> 45:34.301
Nah, we still got the Bucket.

45:34.335 --> 45:37.138
I suppose. For now.

45:37.171 --> 45:38.706
What the fuck
does that mean?

45:42.076 --> 45:43.077
I'll take his.

45:59.494 --> 46:01.195
- Hey.
- Yeah.

46:01.228 --> 46:02.863
You here to pick up Mick?

46:42.770 --> 46:44.038
There he is.

46:44.071 --> 46:45.873
Ah, the dean of Darby Heights.

46:45.906 --> 46:47.841
- Yeah.
- My little leprechaun.

46:47.875 --> 46:49.411
Ah.

46:49.444 --> 46:51.078
Mm. The good stuff, huh?

46:51.111 --> 46:52.913
Ah, eh, enjoy it.

46:52.947 --> 46:55.550
- The usual. I love it.
- Mm.

46:55.584 --> 46:58.219
Quick question for you,
boss man.

46:58.252 --> 46:59.920
Why'd you hire Steve Kelly?

47:00.955 --> 47:02.389
Have a rough night?

47:02.424 --> 47:03.891
Something like that,
yeah.

47:03.924 --> 47:05.627
- You look like shit.
- I mean, the...

47:05.660 --> 47:07.596
I thought I was lead guy,
you know?

47:07.629 --> 47:09.363
Why do we need a guy like that?
Come on.

47:09.396 --> 47:12.366
Listen, he's a great builder.

47:12.399 --> 47:15.704
Okay? And he has a lot
of political connections.

47:15.736 --> 47:17.371
You got a problem with that?

47:17.405 --> 47:19.708
I don't have a...
I don't have a problem with it.

47:19.740 --> 47:22.376
It's just I don't need to be
kept in the dark.

47:22.410 --> 47:23.978
- Listen.
- You know what I'm saying?

47:24.011 --> 47:26.947
Sometimes the dark
is a great place to be.

47:26.981 --> 47:29.116
You don't have to know
everything.

47:29.149 --> 47:32.086
I got this, okay?
I got this.

47:32.119 --> 47:34.723
There's a saying in Italian:
<i>state zitt'.</i>

47:34.755 --> 47:36.223
It means shut the fuck up.

47:36.257 --> 47:38.058
You just go out
and get signatures.

47:38.092 --> 47:41.463
All right? And stop asking
so many fucking questions.

47:52.339 --> 47:53.642
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

47:53.675 --> 47:54.808
- Good?
- Good, good, good.

47:54.842 --> 47:55.843
I'm collecting signatures...

47:55.876 --> 47:57.311
Ain't you Laurence's son?

47:57.344 --> 47:58.480
- Mick, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

47:58.513 --> 48:00.247
What do you got there?

48:00.281 --> 48:01.982
Well, it's a petition
for the new casino zoning.

48:02.016 --> 48:04.351
- So...
- No disrespect, Mick,

48:04.385 --> 48:06.353
but I don't need
the competition.

48:08.690 --> 48:10.157
Um, uh, competition?

48:10.190 --> 48:12.427
Yeah. I'm a mom-and-pop
operation as is.

48:12.460 --> 48:14.529
I provide credit
for my customers.

48:14.562 --> 48:16.864
Oh, okay. So you're, uh,
so you're a bookie.

48:16.897 --> 48:18.433
Nah. No, no, no, no.

48:18.466 --> 48:20.435
I'm an arbiter
of gaming and chance.

48:20.468 --> 48:22.002
But yeah, okay? I'm a bookie.

48:22.036 --> 48:23.971
I do a lot of business
with your old man.

48:24.004 --> 48:25.939
Oh, that's delightful. Yeah.

48:25.973 --> 48:28.309
I'm just going door to door
trying to get some signatures,

48:28.342 --> 48:29.877
uh, 'cause we're
gonna be building...

48:29.910 --> 48:31.680
- Oh, hi, Mick.
- Hey, how's it going?

48:31.713 --> 48:33.715
C-Call me.

48:33.748 --> 48:34.848
Some-sometime.

48:39.853 --> 48:41.221
- Morning.
- Nope. Nope.

48:41.255 --> 48:42.457
We don't want none, honey.

48:42.490 --> 48:43.625
I-I know that, you know,

48:43.658 --> 48:45.225
your time is very valuable.

48:45.259 --> 48:47.495
I'm just collecting
some signatures, okay?

48:47.529 --> 48:49.330
- Oh, no.
- So that we can get zoning...

48:49.363 --> 48:51.198
No, it's bad enough
Barry is out there

48:51.231 --> 48:53.200
chasing white-tailed deer

48:53.233 --> 48:55.869
and blowing all our cabbage
on his hobby.

48:55.903 --> 48:57.037
Okay. Who's Barry?

48:57.071 --> 48:58.072
My husband.

48:58.105 --> 48:59.708
Okay.

48:59.741 --> 49:02.176
And your brother Dougal.
Whoo, what a mush he is.

49:02.209 --> 49:04.479
He's broke,
so stay away from him. For me?

49:04.512 --> 49:06.581
Listen, casinos are the true
extortionists, Mick.

49:06.614 --> 49:08.349
I'm telling you, their wig
is like double mine.

49:08.382 --> 49:09.818
Really?
'Cause you're the good guy,

49:09.850 --> 49:11.820
- and they're the bad guy.
- There you go.

49:11.852 --> 49:14.154
You sell a little bit of crack,
and you're living the dream.

49:14.188 --> 49:15.557
The guy sells the big crack,
no good.

49:15.590 --> 49:16.924
- Look at you, huh?
- Hey.

49:16.957 --> 49:18.225
- Hi.
- Huh?

49:18.258 --> 49:19.527
Nothing for nothing.

49:19.561 --> 49:21.028
That's one way of putting it.

49:21.061 --> 49:22.497
- I'm gonna go now.
- All right.

49:22.530 --> 49:24.031
Hey, tell your old man

49:24.064 --> 49:25.533
if he wants to get any picks
this week,

49:25.567 --> 49:27.000
got to get them in early.

49:27.034 --> 49:28.636
I'm going on vacation.
Mar-a-Lago.

49:32.574 --> 49:34.843
I don't want him in no casino.
Hell, no.

49:34.875 --> 49:36.276
that man ain't got
no self-control,

49:36.310 --> 49:37.612
and don't even get me
started

49:37.645 --> 49:39.547
- on his porn.
- Okay.

49:39.581 --> 49:41.348
Enjoy Barry.
He sounds like a delight.

49:41.382 --> 49:42.450
An absolute treasure.

49:42.484 --> 49:44.084
Well, ultimately,

49:44.118 --> 49:45.420
we're gonna bring
a lot of foot traffic here.

49:45.453 --> 49:47.087
More jobs for the locals.

49:47.121 --> 49:49.256
- Go fuck yourself.
- Okay. Fair enough.

49:49.289 --> 49:50.725
- I'm gonna go...
- And suck a big bag of dicks.

49:50.759 --> 49:52.292
Thank you.
Suck a big bag of dicks.

49:52.326 --> 49:53.762
- Excellent advice.
- Yeah. Like 20 dicks.

49:53.795 --> 49:54.928
Let me... I'm gonna go

50:12.781 --> 50:15.149
When I tell you to stop,
you stop.

50:15.182 --> 50:17.985
Directing here a long time
over here.

50:18.018 --> 50:20.422
They're my streets, man.

50:20.455 --> 50:21.589
- Yo, cuz.
- Hey.

50:21.623 --> 50:23.257
Slow down. Where's the fire?

50:23.290 --> 50:25.159
Okay, take it easy. All right.
I'm with you.

50:25.192 --> 50:26.895
Do me a favor.
Help me direct traffic today.

50:26.927 --> 50:28.228
- Okay.
- It's a busy day.

50:28.262 --> 50:29.764
Safety first.
I got you, buddy.

50:29.798 --> 50:31.633
- Does it fit?
- It... Of course it fits.

50:31.666 --> 50:33.300
Look at this, huh?

50:33.333 --> 50:35.135
Okay, it's a big day
with traffic.

50:35.169 --> 50:36.136
The parade's coming.

50:36.170 --> 50:38.071
Oh, Mick. Mick.

50:38.105 --> 50:39.507
- Yeah.
- Mick, please,

50:39.541 --> 50:41.409
can you please help me
just one minute?

50:41.443 --> 50:43.377
Just one minute? I just...
I cannot find my beads.

50:45.179 --> 50:46.180
Come on!

50:55.623 --> 50:57.759
Everything all right,
Mrs. C?

50:57.792 --> 51:00.294
I cannot find my <i>Komboloi.</i>

51:00.327 --> 51:01.361
I'm sorry?

51:01.395 --> 51:02.362
My <i>Komboloi.</i>

51:02.396 --> 51:03.832
You know, my, uh

51:03.865 --> 51:05.533
my worry beads, see?

51:05.567 --> 51:07.367
You Catholics,
what you call them?

51:07.401 --> 51:08.470
- Rosary.
- Rosary beads.

51:08.503 --> 51:10.705
- Oh.
- I cannot find...

51:10.738 --> 51:13.875
Don't just stand there
with your <i>putza</i> in your hand.

51:13.908 --> 51:15.877
- Help me find them.
- All right.

51:17.311 --> 51:18.480
Oh!

51:18.513 --> 51:20.147
- Are these...
- Oh, damn!

51:20.180 --> 51:22.049
- What's going on?
- Oi!

51:22.082 --> 51:23.217
My back popped.

51:23.250 --> 51:24.619
Okay.

51:24.652 --> 51:27.154
Ohh. Okay.

51:27.187 --> 51:29.691
You have to pull me
from my hips.

51:29.724 --> 51:31.459
Come on.

51:31.493 --> 51:33.728
- Uh, I don't know...
- Pull me from my hips

51:33.761 --> 51:35.128
to pop my back back in.

51:35.162 --> 51:36.296
I don't know about that,
Mrs. C.

51:36.330 --> 51:37.899
Oi, my animal husband,

51:37.932 --> 51:39.534
he used to deduct my back out
once a week.

51:39.567 --> 51:41.034
Come on, it's the only way
it works.

51:41.068 --> 51:43.571
- You sure?
- Grab me by my hips.

51:43.605 --> 51:44.806
- Okay.
- And pull.

51:44.839 --> 51:46.340
- Okay?
- Yeah.

51:46.373 --> 51:48.543
Again. Ai!

51:48.576 --> 51:49.844
Stop!

51:49.878 --> 51:51.078
Yeah. Ooh!

51:51.111 --> 51:53.414
Aah! What the fuck!

51:53.448 --> 51:54.649
- Mick?
- Aah!

51:54.682 --> 51:57.050
- I found them.
- Oh. Aah!

51:57.084 --> 51:58.686
Oh.
You're wrecking the house.

51:58.720 --> 52:01.054
Aah! God damn it!

52:01.088 --> 52:04.057
Oh, my God. I thought you
were Charlie with that vest on.

52:04.091 --> 52:05.493
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

52:05.527 --> 52:07.261
Ohh. Aah.

52:07.294 --> 52:08.663
Oh, my God, you're blinded.

52:08.696 --> 52:10.030
No. I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:10.063 --> 52:11.365
- Okay?
- Yeah.

52:11.398 --> 52:12.901
How many fingers am I holding?

52:12.934 --> 52:14.435
Uh

52:14.469 --> 52:15.537
Ali.

52:15.570 --> 52:17.204
Hey. Oh, listen,

52:17.237 --> 52:18.907
let me make it up to you
about the other night.

52:18.940 --> 52:20.909
I'll take you out for steaks.
How about that?

52:20.942 --> 52:22.944
- Is that cool? How about that?
- Um

52:24.278 --> 52:26.280
- I like lamb.
- Okay.

52:26.313 --> 52:28.416
Okay, great. Tonight I make
a traditional dinner.

52:28.449 --> 52:30.718
I can't. I'm supposed
to see my dad tonight.

52:30.752 --> 52:33.387
So bring him.
And bring some good wine, too.

52:33.421 --> 52:35.757
None of that shit beer
that you guys drink.

52:35.790 --> 52:38.459
I'll see you guys tonight,
if I can.

52:38.493 --> 52:39.961
- All right.
- That looks better.

52:39.994 --> 52:42.530
Oh, by the way,
thanks for the, uh,

52:42.564 --> 52:45.132
release.
You have very soft hands.

53:16.296 --> 53:17.832
Yo, yo, yo, guy.

53:17.865 --> 53:20.300
Hey, guy, turn it off!

53:20.334 --> 53:22.837
Keep your pants on.
Keep your pants on!

53:22.870 --> 53:24.839
It's almost over!

53:24.872 --> 53:27.341
Turn the fucking game on.

53:27.374 --> 53:29.944
Mexican television soap opera?

53:29.978 --> 53:32.346
Got hooked on this
my last time in the clink.

53:32.379 --> 53:35.148
Damn, those Latinas can act.

53:35.182 --> 53:36.350
All right.

53:36.383 --> 53:37.952
No shower, happy hour.

53:37.986 --> 53:39.152
First round's on the house.

53:39.186 --> 53:40.320
It's about time.

53:40.354 --> 53:42.490
Don't sass the bartender.

53:42.523 --> 53:44.692
And he's a good guy.
You know why?

53:44.726 --> 53:48.663
At six years old,
he kicked my kid's ass,

53:48.696 --> 53:50.698
and I respected him for that.

53:50.732 --> 53:52.700
He only made one mistake.

53:52.734 --> 53:54.435
He let your brother
go to work

53:54.469 --> 53:56.104
for that fat fucking guido.

53:56.136 --> 53:57.772
Yeah, I agree with you there.

53:57.805 --> 53:59.306
You should know a little
something about that.

53:59.339 --> 54:01.542
- I got jobs, Pop.
- Oh, bullshit.

54:01.576 --> 54:03.878
You remember what happened

54:03.911 --> 54:05.680
the last time
this asshole went

54:05.713 --> 54:07.214
and tried to buy clothes?

54:07.247 --> 54:10.150
He stole them
off a one-legged woman's

54:10.183 --> 54:12.386
laundry line.

54:12.420 --> 54:14.055
What the fuck was that?

54:14.088 --> 54:16.390
Coach, you give me the word,

54:16.424 --> 54:17.859
and I'll fuck him up
for funzies.

54:17.892 --> 54:19.661
Fuck off, bean head.

54:19.694 --> 54:21.161
You're never gonna let it go,
will you?

54:21.194 --> 54:22.830
It was a fucking ball.

54:22.864 --> 54:24.832
You got to protect the plate
on two strikes.

54:24.866 --> 54:26.400
It was low and outside.

54:26.434 --> 54:28.136
You don't know
what you're talking about!

54:28.168 --> 54:30.004
You clowns ain't settled
on that pitch in 20 years.

54:30.038 --> 54:32.407
Time to put the controversy
to rest once and for all

54:32.440 --> 54:34.008
with a good old-fashioned
sex bet.

54:34.042 --> 54:35.710
There's a fucking great one.

54:35.743 --> 54:38.046
That's a contest...
the blind leading the blind.

54:38.079 --> 54:39.514
All right.

54:39.547 --> 54:42.050
Grand prize is a trophy.

54:44.018 --> 54:46.054
- And the tape.
- You have the fucking tape?

54:46.087 --> 54:47.387
Champ to be crowned
down the shore

54:47.422 --> 54:48.556
Memorial Day weekend.

54:48.589 --> 54:49.891
What are you talking about?

54:49.924 --> 54:51.559
That's my fucking tape.

54:51.592 --> 54:54.261
I recorded
and videotaped the game.

54:54.294 --> 54:55.663
All due respect, Coach,

54:55.697 --> 54:57.699
your tab's older
than that tape is.

54:57.732 --> 55:00.702
All right, fellas,
some ground rules.

55:00.735 --> 55:02.937
Anything out of the ordinary...

55:02.970 --> 55:04.906
teabag, Cleveland steamer,

55:04.939 --> 55:06.874
free Willies
awarded bonus points

55:06.908 --> 55:08.076
at my discretion.

55:08.109 --> 55:09.677
Okay. Hickeys.

55:09.711 --> 55:11.179
Are you fucking kidding me

55:11.211 --> 55:13.114
with the fucking immature shit?

55:13.147 --> 55:14.782
Come on, leave the baby shit
to the fifth graders,

55:14.816 --> 55:16.050
- all right?
- Yeah, that's out.

55:16.084 --> 55:17.018
In fact, hickeys are minus five.

55:17.051 --> 55:18.285
Plate job.

55:18.318 --> 55:19.754
What kind of job?

55:19.787 --> 55:21.288
Plate job, Coach.

55:21.321 --> 55:23.091
Why don't you get a plate job?

55:23.124 --> 55:24.926
He can't even fucking get...

55:26.060 --> 55:27.695
Wait. What about docking?

55:27.729 --> 55:28.963
- What's docking?
- What the fuck is that?

55:28.996 --> 55:30.297
Yeah, what the fuck is docking?

55:30.330 --> 55:31.398
Rusty trombone.

55:31.432 --> 55:32.967
A rusty trombone?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.036
- Coach...
- Is that what Kenny G plays?

55:35.069 --> 55:36.604
- He does, but that's when...
- Mostly clarinet.

55:36.637 --> 55:38.706
No, clarinet. That's it.

55:38.740 --> 55:40.608
Hey, fellas,
remember we're looking

55:40.641 --> 55:42.242
for consensual
bouncing partners.

55:42.275 --> 55:44.311
- Right.
- Yeah. Amen.

55:45.613 --> 55:47.782
- Run the ball, bitch!
- Whoo!

55:47.815 --> 55:49.150
I'm not here!

55:49.183 --> 55:50.785
Not here.

55:50.818 --> 55:51.953
The Bucket.

55:53.421 --> 55:55.790
Yeah, he's here.
Coach. It's for you.

55:57.191 --> 55:58.459
You cocksucker.

56:03.631 --> 56:06.434
It's the first time
he's eaten vegetables

56:06.467 --> 56:08.335
since 1946.

56:08.368 --> 56:10.671
I'll be shitting for a week.

56:10.705 --> 56:12.573
There you go,
like the Green Giant.

56:12.607 --> 56:14.142
you know, I can't...

56:14.175 --> 56:16.778
I can't remember
the last time you were here.

56:16.811 --> 56:18.813
Letitia,
she used to like my food.

56:18.846 --> 56:21.115
Ah. Yes, she did.

56:21.149 --> 56:24.185
And it sure as shit wasn't
meat and potatoes tonight.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.187
No. Not in this house, no.

56:26.220 --> 56:28.489
So you still seeing
that Steve Kelly guy?

56:28.523 --> 56:30.491
Nope, and I never was.

56:30.525 --> 56:32.693
All I did was
an on-site evaluation

56:32.727 --> 56:34.695
urging him
not to open a casino.

56:34.729 --> 56:36.164
That's all.

56:36.197 --> 56:38.365
You know, I go
to the Senior Center

56:38.398 --> 56:40.434
about two, three times
a week.

56:40.468 --> 56:42.170
- Good.
- And we play bingo.

56:42.203 --> 56:43.938
And you can make
a couple of bucks

56:43.971 --> 56:46.140
every now and then, you know.
That's not so bad.

56:46.174 --> 56:48.476
Look at that. Membership
has its privileges, Pop.

56:48.509 --> 56:50.611
I'm not going
to no old age home.

56:50.645 --> 56:51.979
No offense.

56:52.013 --> 56:54.215
That's what I tell my Kukla.

56:54.248 --> 56:55.983
I'm never leaving my house.

56:56.017 --> 56:57.485
Amen.

56:57.518 --> 57:00.320
Ivy, hand me that beer.

57:00.353 --> 57:01.622
- Ivy?
- Yeah.

57:01.656 --> 57:03.057
- What's that?
- Engineering

57:03.090 --> 57:04.357
- from Cornell.
- Yeah, that's right.

57:04.391 --> 57:05.827
Got me out of the Heights.

57:05.860 --> 57:07.962
Got me a job
with Meeta Construction.

57:07.995 --> 57:09.197
Wait. Hold on.

57:09.230 --> 57:10.998
Did you say Meeta Construction?

57:11.032 --> 57:13.534
- Yeah.
- The casino with... with Steve?

57:13.568 --> 57:15.303
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

57:15.335 --> 57:17.305
Yeah. Listen.

57:17.337 --> 57:19.372
Casinos bring jobs, okay?

57:19.407 --> 57:22.543
People in this area,
they need jobs, all right?

57:22.577 --> 57:24.045
- It's a fact, right?
- Yeah, if you...

57:24.078 --> 57:27.014
People from...
not from the Heights.

57:27.048 --> 57:29.517
But we've been working for years
to restore the Heights.

57:29.550 --> 57:32.420
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's nice you're, you know,

57:32.453 --> 57:34.021
says a girl who's privileged

57:34.055 --> 57:36.023
and got out of here by birth,
you know.

57:36.057 --> 57:37.692
Oh, okay, as opposed to what?

57:37.725 --> 57:39.193
Getting out by effort?

57:39.227 --> 57:40.862
- Yeah.
- Wow.

57:40.895 --> 57:42.730
- Real effort.
- I'm really shocked right now

57:42.763 --> 57:44.498
'cause you're the last
person I thought

57:44.532 --> 57:46.200
that would just hammer
that nail in the coffin.

57:46.234 --> 57:48.069
I'm not the one
hammering anything.

57:48.102 --> 57:49.369
- Really, Seamus?
- No.

57:49.402 --> 57:50.838
Do you realize...
Do you realize

57:50.872 --> 57:52.406
if Steve and Meeta
get their way

57:52.440 --> 57:53.708
with all their back-door
politics

57:53.741 --> 57:55.042
that our neighborhood's...

57:55.076 --> 57:56.177
that's that, gone?

57:56.210 --> 57:57.845
- Ivy...
- It's gone...

57:57.879 --> 57:59.180
Come on, take me home.

57:59.213 --> 58:00.581
I promised your brother

58:00.615 --> 58:02.550
I'd come to that
shore house money thing.

58:02.583 --> 58:04.018
All right. I got to get him
out of here,

58:04.051 --> 58:06.020
and I got some paperwork to do.

58:06.053 --> 58:08.356
So thank you.
That was amazing.

58:08.388 --> 58:10.057
You got it.

58:10.091 --> 58:11.792
Let me ask you question.

58:11.826 --> 58:14.762
Did you pass on the stiff pecker
gene to your son?

58:14.795 --> 58:16.530
My Dougal.

58:16.564 --> 58:19.033
Yeah, he's a regular
hard-on, all right.

58:19.066 --> 58:22.436
Katya, thanks for everything.
It was lovely.

58:50.331 --> 58:51.799
Restore the Heights.

58:51.832 --> 58:53.634
What does she think I'm doing,
you know?

58:53.668 --> 58:55.603
You need to restore balance
in your life,

58:55.636 --> 58:57.171
- starting with your chakras.
- She thinks I'm hammering in

58:57.204 --> 58:58.773
that final nail
into the coffin.

58:58.806 --> 59:00.808
It's been dead and buried
for years.

59:00.841 --> 59:03.177
Hmm. Much like your kundalini,
which we need to activate.

59:03.210 --> 59:06.080
A casino would resurrect
the area, don't you think?

59:06.113 --> 59:07.515
- I mean, come on.
- Mick.

59:07.548 --> 59:09.150
It's got nothing going on.

59:09.183 --> 59:10.785
- Mick, Mick, Mick.
- Yeah.

59:10.818 --> 59:13.020
Close your eyes.

59:13.054 --> 59:15.323
Clear your mind.

59:15.356 --> 59:16.590
- What do you see?
- I... First of all,

59:16.624 --> 59:17.992
I can't clear my mind.

59:18.025 --> 59:19.527
Okay, what do you see?

59:27.401 --> 59:29.303
Destruction.

59:29.337 --> 59:30.905
Quiet the noise.

59:38.846 --> 59:40.648
Quiet the noise.

59:49.991 --> 59:51.892
Didn't that feel good?

59:51.926 --> 59:53.661
Yeah.

59:53.694 --> 59:57.198
Mick, it's okay.

59:57.231 --> 59:58.899
I know that you're scared.

59:58.933 --> 1:00:00.301
- I'm not scared.
- No, you're... Shh.

1:00:00.334 --> 1:00:03.004
You're scared.

1:00:04.238 --> 1:00:06.507
Where is home,
that place you speak of?

1:00:06.540 --> 1:00:08.309
Darby Heights.

1:00:08.342 --> 1:00:11.345
And it was never
an enjoyable place for you?

1:00:11.379 --> 1:00:14.215
It was when I was young,
and it's kind of torturous now.

1:00:14.248 --> 1:00:15.683
- Yeah.
- Kind of a glorious,

1:00:15.716 --> 1:00:17.318
torturous situation.

1:00:17.351 --> 1:00:18.386
Yeah.

1:00:19.954 --> 1:00:22.256
I think you need
to stop judging yourself

1:00:22.289 --> 1:00:24.392
and your family so harshly.

1:00:24.426 --> 1:00:28.362
Mick, the work that you are
doing now in here,

1:00:28.396 --> 1:00:30.831
it will enable you
to see them and yourself

1:00:30.865 --> 1:00:32.533
in such a loving light,

1:00:32.566 --> 1:00:37.805
and that, my friend,
is priceless. Hmm?

1:00:40.908 --> 1:00:43.344
That means that today is 235.

1:00:43.377 --> 1:00:46.415
Okay. I think
you just make up the prices.

1:00:52.787 --> 1:00:54.955
Ooh. Fuck.

1:01:02.431 --> 1:01:03.798
What the fuck?

1:01:05.966 --> 1:01:08.269
What the hell is this?

1:01:08.302 --> 1:01:11.272
I knew I didn't drive.

1:01:11.305 --> 1:01:13.207
Which means you're a thief.

1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:14.708
You stole my car.

1:01:14.742 --> 1:01:16.077
You prick.

1:01:17.078 --> 1:01:18.447
Hey, Pop.

1:01:20.081 --> 1:01:22.417
Want a hand to get out?

1:01:22.451 --> 1:01:23.951
- Mm, yeah.
- Can I see you again?

1:01:23.984 --> 1:01:26.053
I doubt it.

1:01:26.087 --> 1:01:27.188
All right, then.

1:01:28.823 --> 1:01:30.658
- That was a put-down.
- Yeah, I got it.

1:01:30.691 --> 1:01:31.926
You lost.

1:01:36.797 --> 1:01:38.666
Looks like we can get
our vendors paid this week

1:01:38.699 --> 1:01:41.268
if you can keep your grubby
hands out of the till.

1:01:41.302 --> 1:01:42.803
It's a good business move.

1:01:42.837 --> 1:01:44.738
What is,
staying out of the red?

1:01:44.772 --> 1:01:48.142
Red, black, poker, blackjack.

1:01:48.175 --> 1:01:51.446
What, you didn't think I know
about the casino, little man?

1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:53.482
It's always about you, huh?
Grabbing money.

1:01:53.515 --> 1:01:55.616
It's not about the money.
It's about helping out Pops.

1:01:55.649 --> 1:01:58.453
Bullshit.
I don't really give a fuck.

1:01:58.487 --> 1:02:00.254
Gamblers make good bar patrons,

1:02:00.287 --> 1:02:03.257
but, uh, the rest of the Heights
might think otherwise.

1:02:03.290 --> 1:02:05.793
I'm so concerned
about the rest of the Heights.

1:02:05.826 --> 1:02:07.628
- Yeah, and you should be.
- That's my main focus.

1:02:07.661 --> 1:02:09.063
It's where you came from,
motherfucker.

1:02:11.799 --> 1:02:13.502
Hey, Coach, what are you doing
out here

1:02:13.535 --> 1:02:15.970
in your grape smugglers?
Get some pants on, old man.

1:02:16.003 --> 1:02:18.639
What are you,
a fucking clothing critic.

1:02:18.672 --> 1:02:22.109
Ah. Look at that.

1:02:22.143 --> 1:02:23.844
Grown-ass man
still getting hickeys.

1:02:23.878 --> 1:02:25.146
That's minus five, Paddy.

1:02:25.179 --> 1:02:26.780
But I bagged Meghan.

1:02:26.814 --> 1:02:29.016
Still grabbing
that low-hanging fruit, huh?

1:02:29.049 --> 1:02:30.552
Look who's talking,

1:02:30.585 --> 1:02:32.887
Mr. Back In Town
to Build a Fucking Casino.

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:34.188
Really?

1:02:34.221 --> 1:02:35.956
Oh, nice.
You're behind that?

1:02:35.990 --> 1:02:37.324
Cool.

1:02:37.358 --> 1:02:38.893
Cool?

1:02:38.926 --> 1:02:42.296
What the fuck
would he know about cool?

1:02:42.329 --> 1:02:45.032
- And you, sir.
- Ah.

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:47.034
- You came back.
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:47.067 --> 1:02:48.736
Did you forget
where you came from?

1:02:48.769 --> 1:02:50.405
I'm just trying
to do good for the Heights.

1:02:50.438 --> 1:02:51.705
- The Heights?
- Yeah.

1:02:51.739 --> 1:02:52.806
It's good for the Heights?

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:54.241
A casino would be good?

1:02:54.275 --> 1:02:56.310
Look around.
What the fuck do you see?

1:02:56.343 --> 1:02:58.580
Does this place use a casino?

1:02:58.613 --> 1:03:01.248
It would destroy it.
Don't you get that?

1:03:01.282 --> 1:03:05.587
The bodega on the corner,
she's trying to sell to who?

1:03:05.620 --> 1:03:09.156
Your pathetic fucking
guido boss.

1:03:09.190 --> 1:03:10.758
The guy who pays my bills.

1:03:10.791 --> 1:03:12.661
I don't give a shit
if he pays your bills.

1:03:12.693 --> 1:03:14.828
He doesn't have the power
you have the potential to have.

1:03:14.862 --> 1:03:17.666
So if you have it,
then get this thing stopped.

1:03:17.698 --> 1:03:19.366
Come on, Coach.
Pops made breakfast.

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.101
Okay? And you could
help him out too.

1:03:21.135 --> 1:03:22.537
Fucking put some pants on,
Coach.

1:03:22.571 --> 1:03:23.871
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- What the fuck.

1:03:23.904 --> 1:03:25.540
Want to get something to eat?

1:03:25.574 --> 1:03:28.209
I've been eating leftovers
the last 40 years.

1:03:38.786 --> 1:03:40.455
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down.

1:03:40.488 --> 1:03:43.123
Cool your tool there,
pizza boy.

1:03:43.157 --> 1:03:44.291
Calm down.

1:03:55.769 --> 1:03:58.872
I was trying my hand
at crab shakes.

1:03:58.906 --> 1:04:00.442
I'm no good at it,

1:04:00.475 --> 1:04:02.276
but I did leave some
back at the bar for you.

1:04:02.309 --> 1:04:04.546
Oh, no. I'm good. Please.
Come on.

1:04:04.579 --> 1:04:06.615
I'll take some of that, though.

1:04:06.648 --> 1:04:07.948
- There you go.
- Yeah.

1:04:07.982 --> 1:04:10.184
Put that thing away.

1:04:18.092 --> 1:04:19.561
it's good to see you here.

1:04:19.594 --> 1:04:21.028
Yeah.

1:04:22.263 --> 1:04:24.798
got a scuff on your pants.

1:04:24.832 --> 1:04:26.701
Yeah. Don't worry about it,
all right?

1:04:37.845 --> 1:04:39.380
You know, when we was kids

1:04:40.715 --> 1:04:43.685
the old man used to take his
crabbing down at the shore.

1:04:45.286 --> 1:04:49.023
First thing, "Put on
the coffee," he'd say.

1:04:49.056 --> 1:04:52.527
"Put on the coffee
and check the crab buckets."

1:04:54.795 --> 1:04:58.165
And on the way out of port,
we'd stop for fresh rolls

1:04:58.198 --> 1:04:59.800
from Zabar's.

1:04:59.833 --> 1:05:04.773
Ah. Put a smear
of strawberry jam on them.

1:05:04.805 --> 1:05:06.840
Then we'd watch the sun rise.

1:05:08.677 --> 1:05:10.377
It was fucking magic.

1:05:12.913 --> 1:05:18.185
And the crabbing season
got shorter and shorter.

1:05:18.218 --> 1:05:20.555
That didn't bother
your grandfather.

1:05:20.588 --> 1:05:24.224
Everyone else
left the belt.

1:05:24.258 --> 1:05:25.460
We stayed.

1:05:25.493 --> 1:05:27.027
Oh.

1:05:27.061 --> 1:05:29.330
Some years, we didn't have
a pot to piss in.

1:05:32.032 --> 1:05:33.802
but I never seen it this bad,
Mick.

1:05:33.834 --> 1:05:35.235
Ah, it's the Delaware, Pop.

1:05:35.269 --> 1:05:37.405
Ah, Christ, the Delaware.

1:05:37.439 --> 1:05:39.574
They taste just as good
as they do from the Chesapeake.

1:05:39.607 --> 1:05:41.241
From Trenton down,
it's a garbage dump.

1:05:41.275 --> 1:05:42.510
- I don't want to hear that shit.
- Everyone knows

1:05:42.544 --> 1:05:44.078
it's the garbage dump, right?

1:05:44.111 --> 1:05:45.680
No one wants to eat
anything out of it.

1:05:45.714 --> 1:05:47.014
Listen to me.

1:05:47.047 --> 1:05:48.650
Every day
I drink a glass of water

1:05:48.683 --> 1:05:49.983
from the Delaware. It's fine.

1:05:50.017 --> 1:05:52.019
It's not fine. It's not.

1:05:52.052 --> 1:05:54.689
Healthy crabs
need fresh water.

1:05:54.723 --> 1:05:56.990
- You hear me?
- I told you I need a crew.

1:05:57.024 --> 1:05:59.927
I can't do it myself.

1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:01.563
There's money to be made
out there.

1:06:01.596 --> 1:06:03.997
Pop, the boat sat for a while.

1:06:04.031 --> 1:06:07.401
It's... It...
It's falling apart, okay?

1:06:07.435 --> 1:06:09.504
The family's falling apart.

1:06:09.537 --> 1:06:12.206
The pub's sunk.
Dougal's wiped.

1:06:12.239 --> 1:06:13.207
- I know.
- No.

1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:14.241
I know!

1:06:18.912 --> 1:06:20.881
And I know

1:06:20.914 --> 1:06:22.316
she left you the pub.

1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:26.855
Here's what else I know.

1:06:26.887 --> 1:06:29.858
A captain never
abandons his ship.

1:06:29.890 --> 1:06:30.924
Or his crew.

1:06:34.395 --> 1:06:36.731
Come now, hmm?

1:06:37.965 --> 1:06:39.266
I need your help.

1:06:43.137 --> 1:06:45.139
You look good a little dirty.

1:06:56.150 --> 1:06:58.453
Yeah, we're gonna need
more boxes, dude.

1:07:02.256 --> 1:07:04.124
I'm in love.

1:07:05.926 --> 1:07:07.327
Oh, extra points
for sacrilege.

1:07:09.096 --> 1:07:10.598
Yeah.

1:07:10.632 --> 1:07:11.699
What? Love is love.

1:07:13.033 --> 1:07:15.269
Red on the head,
fire in the hole.

1:07:18.506 --> 1:07:20.007
That's the pizza dude.

1:07:21.008 --> 1:07:22.943
What's up, motherfucker?

1:07:22.976 --> 1:07:24.646
We going down the shore?

1:07:29.851 --> 1:07:33.153
What the fuck.
Where is everybody?

1:07:33.187 --> 1:07:37.090
Fuck! That donkey dick
is tearing it up.

1:07:37.124 --> 1:07:39.661
Digits is not
winning this thing.

1:07:39.694 --> 1:07:42.196
He can't fuck like me.

1:07:42.229 --> 1:07:46.133
What to do, what to do,
what to do.

1:07:47.401 --> 1:07:49.938
Carla.

1:07:49.970 --> 1:07:51.639
Sure.

1:07:51.673 --> 1:07:53.207
She's Darby Heights
trash,

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.543
but none of us
have ever banged her.

1:07:55.577 --> 1:07:59.046
That's worth nine points.

1:07:59.079 --> 1:08:02.316
And steal the show
at the buzzer.

1:08:04.586 --> 1:08:06.153
So, coming down the shore
or what?

1:08:06.186 --> 1:08:08.021
Only to dump this boat
in the water.

1:08:08.055 --> 1:08:09.657
- Oh, is that so, huh?
- Yeah.

1:08:09.691 --> 1:08:11.693
Also to, uh,
dip your balls under that?

1:08:15.028 --> 1:08:16.698
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:08:16.731 --> 1:08:18.398
You guys heading
down to the shore?

1:08:18.433 --> 1:08:20.300
These guys get a house
at the shore every year.

1:08:20.334 --> 1:08:22.035
- Really?
- Yeah. They almost made it

1:08:22.069 --> 1:08:24.304
to Sunday last year
without getting thrown out.

1:08:24.338 --> 1:08:26.139
This thing might sink
before you get there.

1:08:26.173 --> 1:08:28.710
Yeah, probably.
You going down?

1:08:28.743 --> 1:08:31.513
Um, I'm gonna stay
at my dad's at Sea Isle.

1:08:31.546 --> 1:08:33.748
- Ooh, Sea Isle's fancy.
- Yeah.

1:08:33.781 --> 1:08:35.817
No reason I can't work
while I'm there.

1:08:35.850 --> 1:08:37.652
- Maybe I'll see you there.
- Maybe.

1:08:37.685 --> 1:08:38.920
- All right.
- Bye.

1:08:38.953 --> 1:08:39.921
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1:08:39.954 --> 1:08:41.355
Bye-bye.

1:08:41.388 --> 1:08:42.690
- Dougal!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1:08:42.724 --> 1:08:43.858
Is that my pretzel?

1:08:43.892 --> 1:08:45.325
Where do you think you're going?

1:08:45.359 --> 1:08:46.828
- Wheels up!
- I need to eat lunch.

1:08:46.861 --> 1:08:48.395
You better get your ass
back inside

1:08:48.429 --> 1:08:50.063
and make me
a fucking sandwich.

1:08:50.097 --> 1:08:51.766
Oh, I got a sandwich
for you right here.

1:08:51.799 --> 1:08:54.401
Oh, you're a piece of shit.

1:08:54.435 --> 1:08:56.336
- Fuck you!
- Oh, missed it.

1:08:56.370 --> 1:08:58.673
Fucking pretzel.
Son of a bitch.

1:08:58.706 --> 1:09:00.875
to the shore!

1:09:07.482 --> 1:09:09.383
Avalon!

1:09:09.417 --> 1:09:11.118
Pull over. Rhonda has to pee.

1:09:11.151 --> 1:09:13.253
By the way,
I know you can't afford Waze.

1:09:13.287 --> 1:09:14.856
Where are we going?
Where are we?

1:09:14.889 --> 1:09:16.424
Come on, man,
that was our exit.

1:09:16.457 --> 1:09:19.027
You didn't score shit,
by the way.

1:09:19.092 --> 1:09:20.695
I promised Rhonda, here,

1:09:20.728 --> 1:09:22.630
a weekend
at the Jersey shore.

1:09:23.665 --> 1:09:25.365
Here we go, boys.

1:09:25.399 --> 1:09:27.267
Did you give me
the right directions?

1:09:27.301 --> 1:09:28.970
- This is it.
- Yeah, this is it.

1:09:29.003 --> 1:09:30.270
Right on the water.

1:09:31.906 --> 1:09:33.875
We're... We're...
That's a river, man.

1:09:33.908 --> 1:09:35.577
That's not a...
We're not at the shore.

1:09:35.610 --> 1:09:37.311
Yeah. We're right on the water,
just like I said.

1:09:37.344 --> 1:09:39.781
- This is it. Okay.
- It's a fucking highway, man.

1:09:39.814 --> 1:09:41.315
Yeah, there's a beach out back.

1:09:41.348 --> 1:09:42.984
Check it out.
Yeah, that's of course.

1:09:43.017 --> 1:09:44.652
It's like the sound
of the ocean.

1:09:44.686 --> 1:09:46.921
Yeah, we can bang
a homeless man in a canoe.

1:09:46.955 --> 1:09:48.423
This is...
What the fuck is...

1:09:48.456 --> 1:09:49.657
- It's an estuary.
- This is what you got

1:09:49.691 --> 1:09:51.059
from my fake dick problem?

1:09:51.091 --> 1:09:52.259
That's the best
your dick can do.

1:09:52.292 --> 1:09:53.728
It's not my problem.

1:09:53.761 --> 1:09:55.630
Don't look like the shore to me.

1:09:57.765 --> 1:09:59.834
- It's kind of nice.
- Where's the boardwalk?

1:09:59.867 --> 1:10:01.469
What do you mean, nice?
Look at that.

1:10:01.502 --> 1:10:02.804
Nice and awful, you know.

1:10:02.837 --> 1:10:04.271
He's got a baby inside.

1:10:04.304 --> 1:10:05.974
The fucking highway's
right there.

1:10:07.207 --> 1:10:09.844
All right, here we go, fellas!

1:10:19.119 --> 1:10:20.788
Here you go.
Watch out for the crabbies.

1:10:20.822 --> 1:10:22.289
They're gonna bite ya.

1:10:22.322 --> 1:10:23.825
Ee!

1:10:23.858 --> 1:10:25.325
I wish I was a pair of claws

1:10:25.359 --> 1:10:26.928
scuttling across the floors...

1:10:26.961 --> 1:10:29.363
Floors of silent seas.

1:10:29.396 --> 1:10:31.298
The afternoons
and the evenings,

1:10:31.331 --> 1:10:32.767
sleeping peacefully,

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:34.702
smoothed by long fingers.

1:10:34.736 --> 1:10:37.505
That was my mom's

1:10:37.538 --> 1:10:38.673
favorite poem.

1:10:38.706 --> 1:10:39.874
- Really?
- That's insane.

1:10:39.907 --> 1:10:42.309
And she could... She used to

1:10:42.342 --> 1:10:44.244
tell it to us
here at the beach.

1:10:49.550 --> 1:10:51.619
You know, I have to say

1:10:51.653 --> 1:10:54.922
I don't know why these guys
resent me so much.

1:10:56.223 --> 1:10:58.325
Maybe it's 'cause I have
a shred of ambition.

1:10:58.358 --> 1:10:59.359
What?

1:10:59.393 --> 1:11:00.662
I mean,

1:11:00.695 --> 1:11:03.031
those fucks are all the same.

1:11:03.064 --> 1:11:05.198
- They are.
- Are you finished yet?

1:11:05.232 --> 1:11:07.135
- Actually I'm not. No.
- Great.

1:11:07.167 --> 1:11:09.336
I wanted to... You know why?
'Cause they're not finished.

1:11:09.369 --> 1:11:11.039
Are you finished
feeling sorry for yourself?

1:11:12.573 --> 1:11:14.207
I mean,
what about their problems?

1:11:15.576 --> 1:11:18.579
The casino's gonna demolish us.

1:11:18.613 --> 1:11:19.981
Demolish.

1:11:20.014 --> 1:11:21.482
It's gonna

1:11:21.516 --> 1:11:23.518
Demolish.

1:11:23.551 --> 1:11:24.519
Remember this?

1:11:24.552 --> 1:11:25.853
Is that my bracelet?

1:11:25.887 --> 1:11:27.187
- Yeah.
- You still have this?

1:11:27.220 --> 1:11:28.489
Yeah. Can you believe that?

1:11:28.523 --> 1:11:30.692
- You know I made this?
- I know.

1:11:30.725 --> 1:11:32.427
Oh, I loved doing these.

1:11:41.602 --> 1:11:44.005
There's no need to rush.

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:46.007
You don't even know how to spell
my last name yet.

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:48.576
- No one does, literally.
- Oh, my God.

1:11:48.609 --> 1:11:51.278
I don't think your parents
know how to spell

1:11:53.246 --> 1:11:55.248
Zu-zu-zu... All right.

1:11:55.282 --> 1:11:57.250
You want to go back?

1:11:57.284 --> 1:11:59.087
Oh, I can't.
My dad's in town

1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.856
and I promised I'd visit,
so

1:12:01.889 --> 1:12:03.390
But I'll see you tomorrow?

1:12:03.424 --> 1:12:04.459
Yeah.

1:12:05.827 --> 1:12:08.763
All right, I'm gonna go.
Look, I'm going. Bye.

1:12:13.468 --> 1:12:15.703
Yeah. Rubber duckie.

1:12:15.737 --> 1:12:18.139
It's the biggest rubber duckie
I've ever seen.

1:12:18.172 --> 1:12:20.041
It's huge.

1:12:20.074 --> 1:12:22.477
Aw, Whitey, hey, man,

1:12:22.510 --> 1:12:24.612
uh, there's not enough legroom,
really.

1:12:24.645 --> 1:12:26.581
I think it's kind of
too crowded in here

1:12:26.614 --> 1:12:28.149
for another person, really,

1:12:28.182 --> 1:12:29.817
'cause, I mean, I'd love
to hang out with you

1:12:29.851 --> 1:12:31.318
and everything, but, you know.

1:12:31.351 --> 1:12:33.386
I don't want to go in there
anyway.

1:12:33.421 --> 1:12:35.757
I seen her eat a burrito
earlier.

1:12:35.790 --> 1:12:38.426
That's fine. I don't like
to share anyway.

1:12:39.427 --> 1:12:41.162
Rubber duckie's having fun.

1:12:41.195 --> 1:12:42.964
Although I don't know
about this guy.

1:12:42.997 --> 1:12:44.932
You got to loosen up, man.

1:12:44.966 --> 1:12:47.502
You know, double your pleasure,
double your fun.

1:12:49.137 --> 1:12:51.038
Why don't we go inside
for a bite to eat?

1:12:54.642 --> 1:12:56.343
Uh, b-bye.

1:13:11.192 --> 1:13:12.560
Brought you something.

1:13:30.244 --> 1:13:31.245
Fuck.

1:13:32.513 --> 1:13:33.548
Here you go.

1:13:35.683 --> 1:13:37.185
Ehh.

1:13:37.218 --> 1:13:39.287
What is this,
Vicodin or Viagra?

1:13:39.319 --> 1:13:41.022
- Wow.
- Take a look at your dick.

1:13:41.055 --> 1:13:42.389
- You'll know.
- Turn off the sun.

1:13:42.423 --> 1:13:43.825
- It's too bright.
- Viagra.

1:13:43.858 --> 1:13:45.358
- Ooh. Sorry.
- You got a hard-on?

1:13:45.392 --> 1:13:48.328
- I got a headache.
- What up, fucktards?

1:13:48.361 --> 1:13:49.864
- Hey. How are you?
- Aw, get off me.

1:13:49.897 --> 1:13:52.033
- Ooh.
- What the fuck is that?

1:13:52.066 --> 1:13:53.467
- Yeah.
- We had a good time

1:13:53.501 --> 1:13:56.070
in the hot tub last night.
Right?

1:13:56.103 --> 1:13:58.139
Yeah. We sure did.

1:13:58.172 --> 1:13:59.574
- That's right. See?
- Huh?

1:13:59.607 --> 1:14:01.843
You know, boys?
I wanted no part

1:14:01.876 --> 1:14:03.376
of your lurid little bet

1:14:03.411 --> 1:14:05.880
till I heard Paddy dog me
in the bathroom.

1:14:05.913 --> 1:14:09.917
I swore to Christ
that vengeance would be mine.

1:14:09.951 --> 1:14:15.656
May I present the first-ever
fully documented

1:14:15.690 --> 1:14:18.860
Alabama hot pocket

1:14:18.893 --> 1:14:20.194
with an oral twist?

1:14:20.228 --> 1:14:21.329
- Oh, my God.
- No!

1:14:21.361 --> 1:14:23.363
- Yeah.
- No.

1:14:23.396 --> 1:14:25.166
What the fuck is he doing?

1:14:25.199 --> 1:14:27.400
Oh, enough. Just...

1:14:27.435 --> 1:14:29.070
Ew!

1:14:29.103 --> 1:14:32.173
Oh, yeah.
I've seen you do worse, Paddy.

1:14:32.206 --> 1:14:34.575
- Carla, you are...
- You're evil.

1:14:35.810 --> 1:14:37.545
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:40.615
And the first-ever

1:14:40.648 --> 1:14:42.516
female winner
of a fook-off contest.

1:14:42.550 --> 1:14:44.952
Congratulations on shattering
that glass ceiling.

1:14:44.986 --> 1:14:47.021
To the victor goes the spoils.

1:14:47.054 --> 1:14:49.156
I don't want that fucking tape.

1:14:50.291 --> 1:14:52.093
Oh, it is mint.
It's amazing.

1:14:53.761 --> 1:14:56.063
Look at that. Cool.

1:14:56.097 --> 1:14:58.532
It's Dougal.

1:14:58.566 --> 1:15:00.434
Answer it.

1:15:01.435 --> 1:15:02.603
<i>Hey.</i>

1:15:02.637 --> 1:15:04.205
<i>Where you at,
little Shaft?</i>

1:15:04.238 --> 1:15:05.773
<i>Don't want to miss
my last hurrah</i>

1:15:05.806 --> 1:15:07.642
<i>before my little vacay
in County.</i>

1:15:07.675 --> 1:15:09.377
I'm going to dinner
with Ali,

1:15:09.410 --> 1:15:11.879
and I promise you,
it is not your last hurrah.

1:15:11.913 --> 1:15:13.481
<i>Unbelievable.
With the baby</i>

1:15:13.514 --> 1:15:15.216
<i>and sentencing
on the way and all.</i>

1:15:15.249 --> 1:15:17.285
- <i>Traitor.</i>
- Ooh.

1:15:17.318 --> 1:15:18.853
He's such an infant.

1:15:20.588 --> 1:15:22.490
Just go. Have fun.

1:15:22.523 --> 1:15:23.991
I am having fun.

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:29.330
Although his pregnant girlfriend
is laying down the law.

1:15:29.363 --> 1:15:31.098
You know what?
maybe we should go together.

1:15:31.132 --> 1:15:34.402
I'm not going.
You know that's not my scene.

1:15:34.435 --> 1:15:36.470
Besides, I can get
a lot of work done.

1:15:38.005 --> 1:15:39.674
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

1:15:41.008 --> 1:15:42.777
Okay.

1:15:42.810 --> 1:15:44.812
Just I'm gonna have to
get you another ice cream

1:15:44.845 --> 1:15:47.014
- 'cause you're so
- So sweet?

1:15:48.282 --> 1:15:49.784
You are sweet.

1:15:55.656 --> 1:15:56.991
- Yeah.
- Vodka.

1:15:57.024 --> 1:15:58.459
Hit it.

1:16:00.227 --> 1:16:03.097
Try it out.

1:16:03.130 --> 1:16:04.765
- Hey.
- Ah!

1:16:04.799 --> 1:16:07.301
- Hello!
- Mick is in the fucking house!

1:16:07.335 --> 1:16:10.237
- That's a goddamn entrance.
- Yeah!

1:16:13.708 --> 1:16:16.210
In honor of my brother
today, I say <i>l'chaim.</i>

1:16:16.243 --> 1:16:18.646
- Ah.
- I'm sorry, Father.

1:16:18.679 --> 1:16:21.148
What did I tell you?
Right on the beach!

1:16:23.351 --> 1:16:25.553
- Caw!
- Hey, guys, I'm a cop.

1:16:29.023 --> 1:16:30.391
Fuck the chauffeur.

1:16:33.361 --> 1:16:35.229
Oh. Yeah.

1:16:37.932 --> 1:16:39.400
What is that, Mexican sharing?

1:16:39.434 --> 1:16:40.968
Don't touch my girl.

1:16:41.002 --> 1:16:42.370
Don't touch my beer.

1:16:44.338 --> 1:16:45.506
Seriously?

1:16:54.181 --> 1:16:56.183
I am

1:16:56.217 --> 1:16:57.452
Yeah!

1:16:59.687 --> 1:17:01.423
- Ow.
- Oh!

1:17:01.456 --> 1:17:04.025
- Listen, I got to hold...
- Hang on, you little fucker.

1:17:04.058 --> 1:17:08.896
Ah. Hang on a second!

1:17:10.531 --> 1:17:12.666
You're not... You're not...

1:17:12.700 --> 1:17:15.036
You see,
you always abandon us.

1:17:15.069 --> 1:17:16.937
You always fucking
abandon us.

1:17:16.971 --> 1:17:18.239
Oh, yeah.

1:17:20.409 --> 1:17:21.776
Yeah.

1:17:21.809 --> 1:17:25.046
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah. Look at this.

1:17:25.079 --> 1:17:26.113
Ooh. Ow!

1:17:26.147 --> 1:17:27.348
Wildcat.

1:17:27.381 --> 1:17:28.783
Which one of you is Tasha?

1:17:28.816 --> 1:17:31.085
It's Tacha.

1:18:03.617 --> 1:18:05.319
Seamus!

1:18:05.352 --> 1:18:07.588
Quick, put Savannah and Mary
in with Mick.

1:18:07.621 --> 1:18:08.923
Ali's coming. Go, go, go, go.

1:18:09.458 --> 1:18:11.460
Miss

1:18:16.263 --> 1:18:17.731
Seamus.

1:18:23.037 --> 1:18:24.772
Oh. Nice work.

1:18:24.805 --> 1:18:26.807
Oh, hey, sugar tits.

1:18:26.841 --> 1:18:28.742
Dougal, where's Seamus?

1:18:28.776 --> 1:18:30.811
To the left, the left.
Your bachelor's on the left.

1:18:30.845 --> 1:18:32.813
Ouch! Aah!

1:18:32.847 --> 1:18:34.048
Wow.

1:18:46.227 --> 1:18:48.195
- Hey, asshole.
- Hey.

1:18:48.229 --> 1:18:49.797
Hi. Having fun?

1:18:49.830 --> 1:18:51.866
- Yeah.
- Whee!

1:18:51.899 --> 1:18:53.701
Well, guess what.

1:18:53.734 --> 1:18:55.803
Steve's about to raze
Callahan's,

1:18:55.836 --> 1:18:57.338
and I don't know why I thought

1:18:57.371 --> 1:18:58.939
someone around here
might give a shit.

1:18:58.973 --> 1:19:00.774
- No, no, no. Hey.
- You deal with it.

1:19:00.808 --> 1:19:02.611
No, no, no. What... Ali!

1:19:02.643 --> 1:19:03.911
Fuck.

1:19:09.584 --> 1:19:11.719
Ali. Hey.

1:19:11.752 --> 1:19:13.354
A... Come here.

1:19:13.387 --> 1:19:15.356
Ali. Ali. Ali, come here.

1:19:15.389 --> 1:19:17.191
Hey, come here.
Hold on a second.

1:19:17.224 --> 1:19:19.160
I don't know
what you thought that was.

1:19:19.193 --> 1:19:20.828
That wasn't... Come on.

1:19:20.861 --> 1:19:22.029
- I wouldn't...
- No?

1:19:23.230 --> 1:19:24.698
You wanted me to come here.

1:19:24.732 --> 1:19:26.200
You know what they did.

1:19:26.233 --> 1:19:28.235
Come on. You really think
that I was

1:19:28.269 --> 1:19:30.204
- What? No?
- I was... No!

1:19:30.237 --> 1:19:32.507
Oh, it looked
pretty clear to me.

1:19:34.074 --> 1:19:37.211
You know, you talk so much shit
about your brother,

1:19:37.244 --> 1:19:39.380
but at least he doesn't
pull any punches, all right?

1:19:39.414 --> 1:19:41.182
What you see is what you get.

1:19:41.215 --> 1:19:42.216
I

1:19:42.249 --> 1:19:43.717
You know the pub is gone?

1:19:43.751 --> 1:19:45.052
- What?
- Your boss took over the pub.

1:19:45.085 --> 1:19:46.854
How is that even possible?

1:19:46.887 --> 1:19:49.023
'Cause your dad defaulted
on the mortgage!

1:19:49.056 --> 1:19:51.526
And all those petitions signed?

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:53.928
Delvecchio, he controls it all.

1:19:53.961 --> 1:19:56.096
Did you guys never
read the fine print,

1:19:56.130 --> 1:19:58.365
neither of you,
on the mortgage

1:19:58.399 --> 1:19:59.700
that you commissioned?

1:19:59.733 --> 1:20:01.368
I know...
I know Steve's a creep,

1:20:01.402 --> 1:20:03.572
but I think
he's right about you.

1:20:03.605 --> 1:20:06.373
I don't think the neighborhood
is the problem.

1:20:06.408 --> 1:20:09.411
I think you're the problem.

1:20:09.444 --> 1:20:11.078
Okay.

1:20:11.111 --> 1:20:13.247
- Ali, no, no, no.
- No. Stop it.

1:20:26.093 --> 1:20:29.296
Hey, crew boy, slow down,
you little shit bags,

1:20:29.330 --> 1:20:31.332
and follow the posted
speed limit!

1:20:40.774 --> 1:20:43.978
Whoo! Guess what.

1:20:44.011 --> 1:20:46.981
Your boy fucking did
the impossible.

1:20:47.014 --> 1:20:49.316
- I fucking got this.
- Got what?

1:20:49.350 --> 1:20:50.585
Crabs, probably.

1:20:50.619 --> 1:20:52.920
I bagged the fucking Yeti.

1:20:52.953 --> 1:20:56.725
Ali knows 'cause she heard
Eddie go.

1:20:56.757 --> 1:20:58.092
But no points for hookers.

1:20:58.125 --> 1:21:00.462
They weren't hookers, asshole.

1:21:00.495 --> 1:21:03.264
They were fucking
the ladies choir

1:21:03.297 --> 1:21:05.667
of fucking Darby Heights,
okay?

1:21:05.700 --> 1:21:08.102
And one of them is
in an early stage divorce,

1:21:08.135 --> 1:21:10.505
and the other one
is transitioning.

1:21:10.538 --> 1:21:12.139
And I'm fine with all of it.

1:21:12.172 --> 1:21:17.077
And I just hope to God
I was like.

1:21:17.111 --> 1:21:19.179
- And her friend...
- Was that you or her?

1:21:19.213 --> 1:21:21.148
tongue-darted my asshole.

1:21:21.181 --> 1:21:23.350
Bullshit. She doesn't exist.

1:21:23.384 --> 1:21:25.286
Yo.

1:21:25.319 --> 1:21:26.787
Dude, come on, man.

1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:28.322
If a tree falls in the woods,

1:21:28.355 --> 1:21:29.758
like this fucker.

1:21:29.790 --> 1:21:31.825
Look at this fucking

1:21:31.859 --> 1:21:33.827
- Sack.
- We signed this petition

1:21:33.861 --> 1:21:36.030
thinking it was helping
you, Mickey.

1:21:36.063 --> 1:21:38.332
It's helping all of us, okay?

1:21:38.365 --> 1:21:39.933
- I did you a favor.
- Oh, come on.

1:21:39.967 --> 1:21:41.935
Oh, yeah, by losing
our fucking houses?

1:21:41.969 --> 1:21:44.506
Fuck we supposed to go?
Our lives in the Heights.

1:21:44.539 --> 1:21:46.441
You should be fucking
thanking me!

1:21:46.474 --> 1:21:47.975
Oh, yeah? Give me
a fucking break.

1:21:48.008 --> 1:21:49.376
Who's gonna buy
a piece of shit house

1:21:49.411 --> 1:21:51.045
in the Heights?
Think about it.

1:21:51.078 --> 1:21:52.480
What makes you think
we want to go anywhere?

1:21:52.514 --> 1:21:53.648
Did you ever think about that?

1:21:53.682 --> 1:21:55.049
What is the fuck wrong with you?

1:21:55.082 --> 1:21:56.685
Do something
with your fucking lives!

1:21:59.421 --> 1:22:01.456
Get the fuck out of here.

1:22:01.489 --> 1:22:04.892
Boot your ass
back to Rittenhouse.

1:22:34.855 --> 1:22:37.224
Fucking people over.

1:22:37.257 --> 1:22:38.727
That's not who I am.

1:22:38.760 --> 1:22:41.061
It's not how I was raised.

1:22:41.095 --> 1:22:42.697
Mm.

1:22:42.731 --> 1:22:45.767
you know, Emerson once said,

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:47.901
"To be yourself in a world

1:22:47.935 --> 1:22:50.237
constantly trying
to make you someone else

1:22:50.270 --> 1:22:52.507
is the greatest achievement."

1:22:52.540 --> 1:22:53.541
Hmm.

1:22:55.376 --> 1:22:57.612
I just want to go crabbing
with my dad.

1:22:59.079 --> 1:23:02.282
- Huh.
- Then go to the boat, Mick,

1:23:02.316 --> 1:23:04.452
and free yourself.
Open yourself up

1:23:04.486 --> 1:23:07.287
to the love that's available
for your now.

1:23:07.321 --> 1:23:10.224
Here. Let us emanate
your destiny

1:23:10.257 --> 1:23:11.892
through vibration, shall we?

1:23:13.728 --> 1:23:16.296
Mm, baba kai.

1:23:16.330 --> 1:23:17.699
Baba kai.

1:23:17.732 --> 1:23:20.968
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>

1:23:21.001 --> 1:23:22.737
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>

1:23:22.771 --> 1:23:24.639
Namaste.

1:23:24.672 --> 1:23:28.909
Namaste.

1:23:28.942 --> 1:23:30.445
Very good.

1:23:30.478 --> 1:23:32.045
- All right.
- Very good.

1:23:32.079 --> 1:23:33.313
- Thank you.
- That'll be 250

1:23:33.347 --> 1:23:34.816
- with the chanting.
- 250.

1:23:34.849 --> 1:23:38.018
Hmm.
Seems like too much.

1:23:59.006 --> 1:24:02.009
Never throw the first punch.
Always throw the last one.

1:24:02.042 --> 1:24:04.244
Make sure they never
see it coming.

1:24:04.278 --> 1:24:07.782
Public vulnerability will
get you punked in the clink.

1:24:07.816 --> 1:24:10.017
Do not cry. Do not show fear.

1:24:10.050 --> 1:24:11.619
Hell, don't even urinate

1:24:11.653 --> 1:24:13.822
any more
than is absolutely necessary.

1:24:30.237 --> 1:24:31.238
Come on.

1:24:53.895 --> 1:24:54.929
What the...

1:24:56.029 --> 1:24:57.765
You fucker. You kids.

1:24:59.868 --> 1:25:01.068
Condoms?

1:25:03.571 --> 1:25:05.473
Jesus!

1:25:05.507 --> 1:25:09.844
Oh, my God, man! Come on!

1:25:09.878 --> 1:25:11.345
Yo, but seriously,
I don't like jail.

1:25:11.378 --> 1:25:13.448
There's the wrong kind
of boys in there.

1:25:15.048 --> 1:25:16.818
Are you...

1:25:16.851 --> 1:25:18.419
fucking condoms?

1:25:18.453 --> 1:25:20.588
It's what I should have used
with your mother.

1:25:27.060 --> 1:25:28.295
Yo, Ali!

1:25:34.736 --> 1:25:35.803
Yo, Ali.

1:25:36.905 --> 1:25:38.773
I just want to apologize
for the other night.

1:25:38.806 --> 1:25:40.542
Look, I'm caught between
the shit and the wind here.

1:25:40.575 --> 1:25:42.209
I want to set
the record straight.

1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:49.651
Look at that. They won't
let each other go.

1:25:53.387 --> 1:25:55.423
You're gonna need a manicure.

1:25:55.456 --> 1:25:57.625
That ain't all, Pops.

1:26:04.264 --> 1:26:06.467
Watch out.
You got clean crabs.

1:26:06.501 --> 1:26:09.136
You couldn't leave it
alone, huh?

1:26:09.169 --> 1:26:11.138
Couldn't take
that I'm fucking happy.

1:26:11.171 --> 1:26:12.740
Ah, you should be
thanking me.

1:26:12.774 --> 1:26:15.543
Thanking you?
Thanking you for what?

1:26:15.577 --> 1:26:17.712
For fucking what,
you degenerate?

1:26:17.745 --> 1:26:19.379
You can't even
take care of yourself.

1:26:19.414 --> 1:26:21.081
I'm supposed to take
advice from you?

1:26:21.114 --> 1:26:23.083
At least I know where I'm from.
Son of no one.

1:26:23.116 --> 1:26:25.720
Why, you fucking... I'll throw
you off this fucking boat.

1:26:25.753 --> 1:26:27.989
Yeah. Do it. Do it.
That's the Mick I miss.

1:26:28.022 --> 1:26:30.558
My last time in the clink,
I hoped like hell

1:26:30.592 --> 1:26:32.225
they would have sold the Bucket
and moved out of the Heights.

1:26:32.259 --> 1:26:34.062
But you know what?
They didn't.

1:26:34.127 --> 1:26:35.964
Pops be in a better spot,
maybe Mom would still be here.

1:26:35.997 --> 1:26:37.899
So what are you gonna do
this time

1:26:37.932 --> 1:26:39.968
- when they lock me up, huh?
- What I always do, all right?

1:26:40.001 --> 1:26:41.569
I'm gonna prop you fuckers up,

1:26:41.603 --> 1:26:43.605
and then I'm gonna
go work for the man.

1:26:43.638 --> 1:26:45.840
You're smarter than that. You
should be working for yourself.

1:26:45.873 --> 1:26:47.575
All right? There's plenty
of things we could do

1:26:47.609 --> 1:26:49.510
if we utilize the skills
of our boys in the Bucket.

1:26:49.544 --> 1:26:52.245
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm done.

1:26:52.279 --> 1:26:55.016
You know, your girl's
got the <i>cojones</i>

1:26:55.049 --> 1:26:57.418
to stand up to Kelly
and your douchebag boss.

1:26:57.452 --> 1:26:59.353
She got more Heights in her
than you do.

1:27:10.965 --> 1:27:13.868
Mick, he's scared. Huh?

1:27:16.403 --> 1:27:17.639
Ahh.

1:27:43.498 --> 1:27:46.233
- I noticed... What's going on?
- I hope you're happy.

1:27:46.266 --> 1:27:47.969
- W-What do you mean?
- I lost my business.

1:27:48.002 --> 1:27:49.737
No, no, no.
Hold on a second. I-I

1:27:49.771 --> 1:27:51.539
The mortgage ballooned.

1:27:51.572 --> 1:27:53.508
Kelly came in and called it,
and now we have to leave.

1:27:53.541 --> 1:27:54.842
I... Hold on a second.

1:27:54.876 --> 1:27:55.977
- No, no, he...
- You promised.

1:27:56.010 --> 1:27:57.412
I know I did.

1:27:57.445 --> 1:27:59.212
We built this place
from scratch.

1:27:59.246 --> 1:28:02.249
I know... I know it's not much,
but it's ours.

1:28:02.282 --> 1:28:03.584
- I...
- It's ours.

1:28:03.618 --> 1:28:05.185
- I want you to know...
- I wanted

1:28:05.218 --> 1:28:07.021
to give this to my kids,

1:28:07.055 --> 1:28:09.757
and now... now it's gone.

1:28:09.791 --> 1:28:11.358
- You promised.
- I know I did.

1:28:11.391 --> 1:28:13.695
I believed you.
Just... Just leave.

1:28:13.728 --> 1:28:15.163
- No, no.
- Don't... Leave!

1:28:15.195 --> 1:28:16.731
I want you to know something.

1:28:16.764 --> 1:28:19.167
That I had nothing
to do with this, okay?

1:28:19.199 --> 1:28:20.468
Just leave!

1:28:40.888 --> 1:28:43.223
You sold out
the whole neighborhood, huh?

1:28:43.256 --> 1:28:44.892
- That was going in.
- No, it wasn't.

1:28:44.926 --> 1:28:46.794
who the fuck did you pay off
at City Hall?

1:28:46.828 --> 1:28:48.463
- What are you talking about?
- You and Delvecchio

1:28:48.496 --> 1:28:50.131
are doing some shady shit
right now.

1:28:50.164 --> 1:28:51.866
It never goes down
this fast.

1:28:51.899 --> 1:28:53.101
I can't help you, Mickey.

1:28:55.636 --> 1:28:57.404
You're not gonna give me
anything, huh?

1:28:57.438 --> 1:28:59.841
Nothing.
You're fucking pathetic.

1:29:01.476 --> 1:29:03.845
That casino was never
being built.

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:07.115
What are you talking about?

1:29:07.148 --> 1:29:08.950
Fraud, basically.

1:29:08.983 --> 1:29:11.284
Those houses were
never in jeopardy,

1:29:11.318 --> 1:29:14.088
but he'll use them
to get another loan,

1:29:14.122 --> 1:29:16.224
fund his lifestyle,
buy a yacht.

1:29:16.256 --> 1:29:18.493
Do your homework.
He does this shit all the time.

1:29:21.429 --> 1:29:24.297
You know, you and I are
the same people, Mickey.

1:29:25.633 --> 1:29:27.735
- No, we're not.
- Sons of immigrants,

1:29:27.769 --> 1:29:30.938
turning a blind eye
as we forge ahead.

1:29:30.972 --> 1:29:32.907
Do you think
I like being the guy

1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:34.274
everyone hates in the hood?

1:29:34.307 --> 1:29:35.576
I'm just trying to make a buck,

1:29:35.610 --> 1:29:36.811
just like you.

1:29:40.014 --> 1:29:41.616
So

1:29:41.649 --> 1:29:43.451
I don't know
what you want from me,

1:29:43.484 --> 1:29:45.686
but

1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:48.856
You could either
just take the money

1:29:48.890 --> 1:29:50.124
and be done with it all,

1:29:50.158 --> 1:29:53.261
or I don't know.

1:29:53.293 --> 1:29:54.829
Take the fall with them.

1:30:46.714 --> 1:30:48.216
Well, it's about fucking time.

1:30:48.249 --> 1:30:50.084
Sorry. I was pouring water
out of my boots.

1:30:50.117 --> 1:30:51.853
You know what?
I found the instructions.

1:30:51.886 --> 1:30:53.554
They were in my heel
the whole time.

1:30:53.588 --> 1:30:55.223
What?

1:30:55.256 --> 1:30:56.691
- The signatures.
- Yeah.

1:30:56.724 --> 1:30:58.659
- Excellent.
- Wire frauds, mostly,

1:30:58.693 --> 1:31:01.429
with some, uh, racketeering
and tax evasion

1:31:01.462 --> 1:31:03.363
sprinkled in for good measure.

1:31:03.396 --> 1:31:05.365
All right, this is bullshit.

1:31:05.398 --> 1:31:07.902
Your boy Kelly... You're right.
He's a good builder,

1:31:07.935 --> 1:31:10.204
but you know what he's
even better at? Singing.

1:31:10.238 --> 1:31:12.406
He can hit
the fucking high notes.

1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:14.374
Stupid bastard.

1:31:14.408 --> 1:31:16.110
Madoff-level crimes, man.

1:31:16.143 --> 1:31:17.678
Federal offenses.

1:31:17.712 --> 1:31:19.547
Let me tell you
something, boyo.

1:31:19.580 --> 1:31:23.351
If I go down, we all go down,
including you.

1:31:23.383 --> 1:31:25.887
Yeah. I already prepared
for that.

1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:28.089
I got friends on the inside,
but, you know, you?

1:31:28.122 --> 1:31:30.424
You're a big fish.

1:31:30.458 --> 1:31:32.460
And the fish stinks
from the head down.

1:31:33.961 --> 1:31:35.930
If you want me,
you know where to find me.

1:31:49.744 --> 1:31:50.978
Damn it.

1:31:53.014 --> 1:31:55.316
Car, car! C-A-R!

1:31:56.684 --> 1:31:58.119
Son of a bitch.

1:32:00.288 --> 1:32:01.622
Yeah, let him get hit.

1:32:04.859 --> 1:32:07.295
And clear.

1:32:07.328 --> 1:32:09.797
They got you yet again, huh?

1:32:09.830 --> 1:32:12.066
Yeah, my kid
and his shitbag buddies.

1:32:12.099 --> 1:32:14.101
That's flattering. I don't know
if you have that type of girth.

1:32:14.135 --> 1:32:16.070
It's... It's close to accurate.

1:32:16.103 --> 1:32:19.507
The future of Darby Heights
is a pathetic mess, isn't it?

1:32:19.540 --> 1:32:21.242
- Tell me about it.
- Yeah.

1:32:21.275 --> 1:32:23.144
Anyway, your brother ever
show up for that warrant?

1:32:23.177 --> 1:32:24.345
Probably not.

1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:29.250
You still friends
with that guy Lombardo?

1:32:29.283 --> 1:32:30.785
Marto Lombardo.

1:32:30.818 --> 1:32:32.153
- Lombardo from Huey Street?
- Yeah.

1:32:32.186 --> 1:32:33.487
Yeah, yeah, I know him.

1:32:33.521 --> 1:32:34.655
I heard he became a fed.

1:32:34.689 --> 1:32:36.123
Yeah, I know him.

1:32:36.157 --> 1:32:37.959
He's some kind
of big bullshit now.

1:32:40.361 --> 1:32:41.495
What's this?

1:32:41.529 --> 1:32:42.964
That, my friend,

1:32:42.997 --> 1:32:45.499
is the biggest collar
you'll ever make.

1:32:45.533 --> 1:32:47.868
Yeah, right.

1:32:47.902 --> 1:32:49.837
Want to be the hero
of Darby Heights?

1:32:59.213 --> 1:33:01.015
Holy shit.

1:33:16.564 --> 1:33:19.066
The great Sun Tzu said,
"The art of war is

1:33:19.100 --> 1:33:20.601
to subdue the enemy

1:33:21.669 --> 1:33:22.837
without fighting."

1:33:22.870 --> 1:33:24.505
- No fighting?
- Pussy.

1:33:24.538 --> 1:33:26.240
- Sun who?
- S... Forget it.

1:33:26.273 --> 1:33:28.142
Fuck you doing here,
traitor?

1:33:28.175 --> 1:33:30.077
Look, I piss and moan
about being back in the Bucket,

1:33:30.111 --> 1:33:31.979
and the reality is

1:33:32.013 --> 1:33:33.180
I had it ass-backwards.

1:33:33.214 --> 1:33:34.416
You been at sea too long.

1:33:34.449 --> 1:33:35.916
No, no, no. Seriously.

1:33:35.950 --> 1:33:37.318
I'm going to save
Darby Heights.

1:33:37.351 --> 1:33:39.020
No shit, genius.

1:33:39.053 --> 1:33:40.921
Operation Save the Hood's
already in motion.

1:33:40.955 --> 1:33:43.190
- Right here.
- Good old-fashioned blackmail.

1:33:45.593 --> 1:33:47.128
I'm gonna save the Heights.

1:33:57.972 --> 1:33:59.240
That was easy, huh?

1:33:59.273 --> 1:34:01.742
Knock down one, put
up ten.

1:34:01.776 --> 1:34:03.412
Mr. Delvecchio.

1:34:03.445 --> 1:34:04.612
Uh

1:34:04.645 --> 1:34:06.013
Special Agent Williams.

1:34:06.047 --> 1:34:07.381
That's Agent Lomardo.

1:34:07.416 --> 1:34:08.849
You're under arrest.

1:34:08.883 --> 1:34:10.017
Arrest? No, no, no, no.

1:34:10.051 --> 1:34:11.118
you got it all wrong.

1:34:11.152 --> 1:34:12.720
For embezzlement, fraud.

1:34:12.753 --> 1:34:14.423
Fraud? I'm going on vacation.

1:34:14.456 --> 1:34:16.257
Oh, yeah. You're going
on vacation, all right.

1:34:16.290 --> 1:34:18.460
Oh, son of a bitch!

1:34:18.493 --> 1:34:20.961
Thought you had Darby Heights
figured out, huh?

1:34:20.995 --> 1:34:22.763
Yeah, figure this out,
you jack-off.

1:34:22.797 --> 1:34:24.365
Fucking get in the car.

1:34:24.398 --> 1:34:25.933
Stick it up your ass,
stupid rent-a-cop.

1:34:25.966 --> 1:34:28.102
Right. Don't drop the soap,
you fat bastard.

1:34:28.135 --> 1:34:29.603
- Get in the car.
- Soap on a rope.

1:34:29.637 --> 1:34:33.040
Yeah, okay.
Good job, Seville.

1:34:33.074 --> 1:34:34.575
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks a lot, Lombardo.

1:34:34.608 --> 1:34:36.243
Call my wife.

1:34:36.277 --> 1:34:38.245
I'm still a prick, though.

1:34:46.821 --> 1:34:48.490
Do you even know
what you're doing?

1:34:48.523 --> 1:34:50.291
I have no idea, or else
I wouldn't be hanging out

1:34:50.324 --> 1:34:51.959
with the likes of you.

1:34:51.992 --> 1:34:53.428
Just put your fucking
screwdriver in there,

1:34:53.462 --> 1:34:55.129
- and I'll turn it over.
- Okay, boys,

1:34:55.162 --> 1:34:57.566
I guess that's last call
on the Delfuckio.

1:34:59.501 --> 1:35:01.168
Mick,
I don't know what to say.

1:35:01.202 --> 1:35:02.736
You have
a thicker skinned dildo

1:35:02.770 --> 1:35:04.338
than I ever gave you
credit for.

1:35:06.207 --> 1:35:07.808
You coming in for a session?

1:35:07.842 --> 1:35:09.977
Give me a minute.

1:35:10.010 --> 1:35:11.779
Trying it.
Put your tool in there

1:35:11.812 --> 1:35:13.415
or whatever the hell
you're using.

1:35:13.448 --> 1:35:15.316
Screwdriver.

1:35:15.349 --> 1:35:18.085
Maybe you want to bring him back
for some baklava?

1:35:18.119 --> 1:35:19.286
Hey, have fun.

1:35:20.555 --> 1:35:22.123
I'm sorry about...

1:35:22.156 --> 1:35:24.391
I am sorry
about that night, seriously.

1:35:26.026 --> 1:35:28.095
Thank you. Same.

1:35:28.129 --> 1:35:30.331
- I talked to Dougal.
- Oh.

1:35:30.364 --> 1:35:32.434
I know a way that we can
earn more bonus points,

1:35:32.467 --> 1:35:33.634
if you're game.

1:35:35.069 --> 1:35:36.170
Madam.

1:35:37.539 --> 1:35:39.106
Beware.

1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:40.307
Oh, my God.

1:35:41.409 --> 1:35:43.210
Oh, God, don't do that
in front of me.

1:35:43.244 --> 1:35:44.678
All right. Copy that, Coach.

1:35:44.712 --> 1:35:46.046
- Never again.
- All right. Fair enough.

1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.115
Never again. It's sick.

1:35:48.149 --> 1:35:50.284
You're sick.
Try this thing again.

1:35:50.317 --> 1:35:51.886
Tried it until my pants...

1:35:51.919 --> 1:35:53.821
When's the last time
anyone tried to kiss you?

1:35:53.854 --> 1:35:55.956
I live on Altoids, bud.

1:35:55.990 --> 1:35:57.526
All right,
then give us a kiss. Come.

1:35:57.559 --> 1:36:00.961
All these Irish are drunks
and a little gay.

1:36:00.995 --> 1:36:02.296
- What's wrong with that?
- Maybe.

1:36:02.329 --> 1:36:03.831
And freckles all
over.

1:36:03.864 --> 1:36:05.634
You know something
I just realized?

1:36:05.666 --> 1:36:08.537
You look like that guy
on <i>The Outback & Under.</i>

1:36:08.570 --> 1:36:09.837
About the dogs

1:36:09.870 --> 1:36:11.405
or whatever it's about.

1:37:36.757 --> 1:37:37.925
Yeah.

1:37:37.958 --> 1:37:40.327
Oh, babies.

1:37:40.361 --> 1:37:42.229
- Peace and quiet.
- Ah.

1:37:42.263 --> 1:37:43.665
All I wanted nine months ago

1:37:43.698 --> 1:37:44.999
was a little peace
and some quiet.

1:37:45.032 --> 1:37:46.400
Whoa. Twins look good on you.

1:37:46.434 --> 1:37:48.168
Ah, fuck off.

1:37:48.202 --> 1:37:49.970
When the doctor said
there was another head up there,

1:37:50.004 --> 1:37:51.640
I was like, "Grabbing
a two-headed kid?"

1:37:51.673 --> 1:37:53.742
'Cause it'll always be a ball.

1:37:53.774 --> 1:37:55.242
It was a strike.

1:37:55.276 --> 1:37:56.511
Can we just watch the tape

1:37:56.544 --> 1:37:57.612
before these kids are old age?

1:37:57.646 --> 1:37:59.079
Yeah.

1:37:59.113 --> 1:38:00.948
Yeah.
I'm working hard over here.

1:38:00.981 --> 1:38:02.850
Always be a fucking ball.

1:38:02.883 --> 1:38:05.286
It was a strike. Watch.

1:38:05.319 --> 1:38:06.987
<i>Way to go, Jim!</i>

1:38:07.021 --> 1:38:08.856
<i>Go, go, go!
Don't swing, don't swing!</i>

1:38:08.889 --> 1:38:10.824
- <i>Don't swing!</i>
- Yo, yo, yo.

1:38:13.662 --> 1:38:16.330
<i>Yes!
Fuck me like a jackhammer!</i>

1:38:16.363 --> 1:38:18.365
- <i>Aah!</i>
- Da!

1:38:18.399 --> 1:38:20.267
<i>Ahh!</i>

1:38:20.301 --> 1:38:23.170
<i>I dropped
my fucking glasses.</i>

1:38:23.203 --> 1:38:24.371
Mom?

1:38:24.405 --> 1:38:26.741
<i>Ah!</i>

1:38:28.643 --> 1:38:30.010
Ugh.

1:38:30.044 --> 1:38:31.546
Oh, that looks like Arby's

1:38:31.579 --> 1:38:34.181
<i>Ah. Ahh.</i>

1:38:34.214 --> 1:38:35.382
<i>Ah, you did it.</i>
