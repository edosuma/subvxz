WEBVTT

00:02.402 --> 00:04.170
(door opens)

00:04.204 --> 00:05.338
(siren blows)

00:10.343 --> 00:11.678
(door opens)

00:15.716 --> 00:19.152
Well, we're here.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.120
(siren blows)

00:20.153 --> 00:21.354
Tomorrow we start.

00:21.387 --> 00:22.789
Are we ready?

00:22.823 --> 00:25.091
As ready as we're
going to get, I think.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.260
The D. A. Offered
murder two this afternoon,

00:27.293 --> 00:28.394
just like we thought
he would.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.395
And you turned it down?

00:29.429 --> 00:30.430
Yes.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.799
(sighs)

00:32.833 --> 00:35.536
Tell me something
good, Rebecca.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.170
I need to hear
something good.

00:38.138 --> 00:38.905
Well, it won't be long

00:38.939 --> 00:40.674
till we know
what's going to happen.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.509
That's good.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.810
My sister came to visit.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.413
She doesn't want
to get up there.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.282
Can they make her?
She doesn't want to.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.585
Well, unfortunately,
siblings can be forced

00:51.618 --> 00:53.453
to testify
against each other.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.588
There's no privilege.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.389
What if she says
she forgets?

00:56.422 --> 00:58.291
That won't do us
any good, Jan.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.326
She has to tell the truth.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.396
Plus, they already have
her statement to the police.

01:03.429 --> 01:07.467
We're not trying
to hide what happened.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.337
We just have
to explain why.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.140
Why I killed my mother.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.678
Yes.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.348
Tell me something good.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.151
I need to hear
something good.

01:30.557 --> 01:34.561
(music playing)

02:17.871 --> 02:19.840
That was the last cup.
Well, we can make more.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.342
I don't have time to wait.
I have to be in court.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.476
What's going on?

02:23.510 --> 02:24.344
She just drank
the last cup of coffee.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.412
Well, you don't seem
to need it, Rebecca.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.748
Oh, funny, Ellenor.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.216
Do I torment you as you're
about to head off for trial?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.585
Torment?
Now I'm tormenting you?

02:31.618 --> 02:32.285
That was the last cup.
BOBBY: All right.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.354
We ready?
No, we're not ready.

02:34.387 --> 02:35.889
I'm going to have
a caffeine headache

02:35.922 --> 02:37.858
because she just swooped in
and chugged the pot.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.626
Okay, so now I chugged it?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.494
Rebecca, come here
for a second.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.465
You're nervous.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.600
It has got
nothing to do--

02:46.633 --> 02:49.536
Rebecca, they sell coffee
on the way to the courthouse,

02:49.570 --> 02:50.771
they sell it
at the courthouse.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.372
You'll get your coffee.

02:52.405 --> 02:53.339
That's not the point.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.608
What's the point?

02:55.341 --> 02:56.342
Never mind.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.478
Ready?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.780
All set.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.848
She just swooped in
and chugged it.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.551
(horn blows)

03:07.721 --> 03:09.756
Jan came in from Yew York.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.892
I picked her up
at the airport.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.894
We drove together
to mom's.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.996
We were going to celebrate
her birthday.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.397
Your sister's?

03:17.430 --> 03:20.466
Yes, and it was
just a normal dinner

03:20.801 --> 03:22.903
until the cake.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.237
That's when--

03:25.939 --> 03:28.008
well, it was German
chocolate cake.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.743
Is that significant?

03:29.776 --> 03:32.412
Jan is allergic
to coconut--

03:32.445 --> 03:34.981
very allergic,
and she got upset,

03:35.015 --> 03:36.717
angry with mom.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.884
(gasps)

03:37.918 --> 03:38.852
And then mom
got defensive.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.820
She said
she just remembered

03:39.853 --> 03:41.688
that there was something
about chocolate cake--

03:41.722 --> 03:42.756
German chocolate cake--

03:42.789 --> 03:46.292
that she thought it might be
Jan's favorite cake.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.829
Well, that just spiraled
into one of their fights.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.897
They started screaming
at each other,

03:51.932 --> 03:56.269
and I couldn't stay
and listen to them.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.403
One of their fights.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.706
What were they
fighting about?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.543
Jan claims that my father
sexually abused her

04:03.009 --> 04:04.778
for years.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.448
She thinks mom knew
and looked the other way.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.283
Was it true?

04:10.316 --> 04:12.318
Did your father
sexually abuse your sister?

04:12.352 --> 04:14.555
Objection-- foundation.
Sustained.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.557
Did you ever see
your father abuse her?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.690
No.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.459
Did Jan ever tell you
she was being abused

04:19.492 --> 04:20.326
by her father?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.796
Not back then.
Only later--

04:24.397 --> 04:27.333
a few years ago
after he had already died.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.434
Did you believe her?

04:28.468 --> 04:31.004
Objection-- relevance.
Sustained.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.339
Did you ever see
any evidence

04:33.373 --> 04:35.341
that supported
your sister's contention

04:35.375 --> 04:37.443
that she had been
sexually abused?

04:37.477 --> 04:38.979
No.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.447
All right,
back to that night.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.616
What did you do

04:42.649 --> 04:44.518
while your mother
and sister were arguing?

04:44.551 --> 04:46.853
I just left.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.955
I told them I wouldn't
be a part of it.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.458
I went out to my car
and just sat there...

04:52.492 --> 04:54.761
crying, actually.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.462
And then what happened?

04:56.496 --> 04:58.464
I heard screaming.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.866
I ran inside,

04:59.900 --> 05:03.637
and I saw the blood
all over the place,

05:05.138 --> 05:07.941
and I found Jan
in the kitchen.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.777
She couldn't move.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.715
She was just sitting there,
like in-- in a haze.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.486
And my mother was lying on
the kitchen floor...

05:21.888 --> 05:23.056
the knife still in her.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.860
(voice cracking)
She'd--

05:26.893 --> 05:28.562
She'd killed mom.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.883
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.051
You like it?

05:51.084 --> 05:55.822
Like it? Lindsay, you're
the most beautiful--

05:55.856 --> 05:56.590
Oh, my God, I'm just--

05:56.623 --> 05:57.924
No, no. No, no, no--
Pins, pins.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.828
Oh, I'm so sorry.
She's just so beautiful.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.630
Helen.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.967
I'm so-- Oh, God,
you look like a princess.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.136
(horn blows)

06:10.170 --> 06:12.472
When you picked
your sister up at the airport

06:12.506 --> 06:13.907
and drove her
to your mother's house,

06:13.940 --> 06:16.743
did she seem different
to you in any way?

06:16.777 --> 06:17.578
No.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.079
And you said the dinner
was uneventful

06:19.112 --> 06:20.881
until your mother brought out
the birthday cake.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.915
Yes.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.183
So, before the cake
was served,

06:23.216 --> 06:24.718
it would have been
unthinkable

06:24.751 --> 06:26.152
for your sister
to attack your mother?

06:26.186 --> 06:28.454
Sustained.
Objection.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.691
Prior to that dinner,
had you any reason

06:30.724 --> 06:32.659
to think your sister
might be a violent person?

06:32.693 --> 06:33.927
No.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.563
Jan's always been
a quiet person,

06:36.597 --> 06:38.699
a gentle person.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.834
And when you found
your sister in the kitchen,

06:40.867 --> 06:43.870
you said
she was "in a haze."

06:43.904 --> 06:45.506
Did you say
anything to her?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.741
Yes, I was screaming at her,
asking what happened.

06:47.774 --> 06:48.875
Did she respond?

06:48.909 --> 06:51.578
No, she--
she just sat there

06:51.612 --> 06:53.113
like a zom-- sh--

06:55.649 --> 06:56.917
Like a zombie?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.418
That's what
you were going to say?

07:01.187 --> 07:02.689
Aloud. If you would.

07:04.691 --> 07:05.759
Yes.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.828
Thank you.

07:07.861 --> 07:08.862
That's all.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.169
(indistinct chatter)

07:16.202 --> 07:17.704
I thought that went well.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.639
You did?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.140
Well, she didn't say
anything that damaging,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.007
at least not--

07:21.041 --> 07:22.609
Bec, that was her sister.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.044
The jury's going to go
back in that room

07:24.077 --> 07:26.713
and say her own sister
testified against her.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.716
Plus, to make insanity,
we got to prove that she was

07:29.750 --> 07:32.052
having a flashback
of some prior abuse

07:32.085 --> 07:33.053
while we can't even
really seem

07:33.086 --> 07:36.222
to prove the abuse happened
in the first place.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.525
Now, are you ready
with the doctor?

07:38.559 --> 07:39.660
I'm ready.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.495
(door opens)

07:42.529 --> 07:45.165
It's bad luck for you
to see me in it first,

07:45.198 --> 07:46.733
but I just wanted
to give you a peek

07:46.767 --> 07:48.935
at the material.
It is so great.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
The material of what?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.772
Isn't it gorgeous?
Touch it.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.174
What's this?

07:54.207 --> 07:55.876
My wedding dress.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.045
You know, the things brides
wear at the ceremony?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.547
Lindsay, I thought you
were going to wear

08:00.581 --> 08:01.782
my mother's wedding dress.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.149
What?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.251
We talked about this.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.621
We talked about me wearing
your mother's wedding dress?

08:07.654 --> 08:10.891
Yes. I mean,
the very night I proposed,

08:10.924 --> 08:12.626
I said you'd walk
down the aisle

08:12.659 --> 08:14.961
wearing my mother's
wedding dress.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.863
I-I've been saving it.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.865
I don't remember you saying
anything about wearing--

08:18.899 --> 08:20.867
I talked
about how beautiful it is...

08:20.901 --> 08:21.668
I don't remember.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.969
And how great you'd
look in it.

08:23.003 --> 08:23.970
Bobby, I don't remember.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.305
How could you not remember?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.073
I'd just been stabbed,
and then you proposed,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.975
and I don't remember you
saying anything about--

08:29.009 --> 08:32.245
Okay, never mind.
This is beautiful.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.116
I'm sure
they'll take it back.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.152
Take it back?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.725
The detective will be quick,

08:44.758 --> 08:46.993
then we'll put up
Dr. Starger,

08:47.027 --> 08:48.729
and then you, Jan.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.696
(gasps)

08:49.730 --> 08:51.598
Okay.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.635
Should we go
over my testimony again?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.336
Well, actually,
I would prefer not to.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.706
I don't want you sounding
too rehearsed,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.275
but, Jan,

09:02.308 --> 09:05.145
you'll have to tell
your story,

09:05.178 --> 09:07.748
no matter
how painful it is.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.784
If you close down
up there,

09:10.817 --> 09:11.818
we're in trouble.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.656
Okay.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.026
It's going well so far,
right?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.262
It's going well?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.601
It's a little
too soon to tell.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.245
His mother?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.815
Yes, he expects me to wear
the dress that she wore.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.316
I've seen a picture
of his mother.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.819
She was built
like a dump truck.
Helen.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.154
You cannot not wear
the dress you had made.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.222
It's a big deal to him.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.891
You know him and his mother.
He gets very emotional.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.158
Have you seen
what she wore?
No.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.928
I'm sure it's hideous.
Let's think about this.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.963
He's been saving it
since she died.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.765
Okay,
here's how you play it.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.834
"Honey, I'd love to wear
your mother's dress."

10:00.867 --> 10:02.803
Then, when you see it,
for whatever reason,

10:02.836 --> 10:04.304
it just won't work.
Lie to him?

10:04.337 --> 10:07.641
Yes. On this, absolutely.
See the dress, love it.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.542
You'd die to wear it,

10:08.575 --> 10:10.076
but since the last one
who did <i>did--</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:12.145
Helen.
You know what I mean.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.280
Make the gesture.
It'll make him happy.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.182
Then wear the gorgeous one
you had made.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.187
Jan came to see me
about two years ago,

10:21.221 --> 10:23.289
just after the death
of her father.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.992
She was feeling sleepy
and sad.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.260
She was having
health problems

10:27.293 --> 10:28.962
that were interfering
with her work,

10:28.995 --> 10:31.031
and she also complained
about not being able

10:31.064 --> 10:33.033
to keep relationships
with men.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.968
Anything else, doctor?

10:35.001 --> 10:35.902
Yes.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.437
There were periods of time

10:37.470 --> 10:39.439
that she couldn't
account for--

10:39.472 --> 10:41.007
sometimes minutes,

10:41.041 --> 10:44.678
but other times,
she lost hours.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.347
I found her to be suffering
from P. T. S. D.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.683
P.T.S.D.?

10:49.716 --> 10:53.119
Post-traumatic stress
disorder.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.055
Could you tell the jury
what that is?

10:55.088 --> 10:57.457
Certainly. Basically,
it's a complex set

10:57.490 --> 10:59.693
of reactions
to a traumatic event.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.027
In this case,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.897
Jan was experiencing
a flashback.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.331
Flashback?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.734
Yes. We see it often
in Vietnam vets,

11:07.768 --> 11:10.070
rape victims,
plane crash survivors.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.039
These flashbacks
are short but intense

11:13.073 --> 11:15.408
and extremely real
to the patient.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.410
You mean like
a hallucination?

11:17.443 --> 11:19.746
Yes, but even more real.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.116
It's as if they are living
inside of the memory,

11:23.149 --> 11:25.719
like it's happening
at that very instant.

11:25.752 --> 11:26.953
And specifically,

11:26.987 --> 11:30.090
what memory are we
talking about with Jan?

11:31.457 --> 11:34.761
Her being sexually abused
by her father.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.497
Did you determine what triggers
these flashbacks with Jan?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.499
It could be
almost anything--

11:39.533 --> 11:41.968
a sound, a smell,

11:42.002 --> 11:43.737
an anniversary
of the event.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.005
What about
a birthday party?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.472
That's certainly possible.

11:46.507 --> 11:48.909
Doctor, did you
interview Ms. Carlson

11:48.942 --> 11:50.811
after she killed
her mother?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.446
Yes. I spent
several hours with her.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.917
Did you form a medical opinion
as to what happened that night?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.418
Yes, I did.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.820
Could you state it?

11:59.853 --> 12:03.023
In my opinion,
Jan Carlson experienced

12:03.056 --> 12:05.391
a post-traumatic stress
flashback,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.394
and while she was living
inside of the memory

12:08.428 --> 12:10.130
of that sexual abuse,

12:10.163 --> 12:13.099
she lashed out
at the one person

12:13.133 --> 12:14.400
that she then considered

12:14.434 --> 12:16.970
to be her most imminent
threat.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.540
But her mother wasn't
the one abusing her.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.241
At that moment,

12:21.274 --> 12:24.778
it could have been anyone
in the room.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.781
Jan Carlson killed her mother
without even knowing it.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.751
(indistinct chatter)

12:34.955 --> 12:37.323
It's beautiful,

12:37.357 --> 12:39.092
but it's--
it's a little short.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.294
I think it's going
to be too short,

12:41.327 --> 12:42.195
and what a shame.

12:42.228 --> 12:45.165
I'm told it can be
lengthened, no problem.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.969
Oh. Oh, great.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.336
Wow.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.838
Is it from the 1800s?

12:51.872 --> 12:52.939
I think it's Edwardian.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.941
Lindsay,
you are going to look

12:54.975 --> 12:56.810
so, so beautiful in it.

12:56.843 --> 13:00.113
I mean, I-I feel like
I'm going to cry

13:00.146 --> 13:02.949
just seeing you
stand next to it.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.185
Me, too. You know,
I wish I could see it on

13:05.218 --> 13:07.487
without having to alter it
'cause it's just so perfect,

13:07.521 --> 13:08.955
I would hate to do
anything to it.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.057
Lucy, would you
try this on?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.826
Over my dead body.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.295
I mean, Bobby,
I wouldn't want to insult

13:15.328 --> 13:16.930
your mother's dead body.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.499
Please, it'll take you
two seconds.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.967
What's wrong?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.204
Nothing.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.271
I'm just so moved.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.480
You say that in one
of these flashbacks,

13:34.515 --> 13:38.051
the person has no control
over his or her actions.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.453
No conscious control,
that's right.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.422
Would they have enough control

13:42.455 --> 13:44.257
to say...
grab a kitchen knife...

13:44.490 --> 13:45.391
...as a weapon?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.060
I think so.

13:47.894 --> 13:48.494
Well, would they have enough
control

13:48.529 --> 13:50.096
to open a cabinet drawer,

13:50.263 --> 13:51.565
to grab that kitchen knife?

13:51.998 --> 13:52.999
I don't know.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.168
Would a person
have enough control

13:55.201 --> 13:56.402
over their actions

13:56.436 --> 13:58.639
to open a cabinet drawer,
search for a knife

13:58.672 --> 14:00.607
from among a dozen
other kitchen tools,

14:00.641 --> 14:02.342
then pursue a victim
throughout the house?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.143
Objection.
Objection.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.911
There's been
no evidence of pursuit.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.513
The objection is sustained.

14:06.547 --> 14:08.214
Dr. Starger.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.053
Can you tell us for a fact

14:13.086 --> 14:16.056
that Jan Carlson experienced
one of these flashbacks

14:16.089 --> 14:17.891
the night she murdered
her mother?

14:17.924 --> 14:19.325
Objection the term "murder."

14:19.359 --> 14:21.494
Murder involves
a culpable state of mind--

14:21.528 --> 14:23.363
Withdrawn. Can you
tell us for a fact

14:23.396 --> 14:26.232
she suffered from a flashback
the night she killed her mother?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.201
That would be impossible
to know.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.137
Have you ever seen the defendant
experience a flashback?

14:31.171 --> 14:32.172
No.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.173
You've never seen it?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.274
Once?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.076
No.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.944
So, for all
you actually know,

14:37.978 --> 14:39.980
Jan Carlson may have
made up these stories

14:40.013 --> 14:41.982
about flashbacks
and sexual abuse.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.316
Look, I have been
treating her

14:43.349 --> 14:45.085
for a very long time--

14:45.118 --> 14:47.320
Has she ever
offered you any proof

14:47.353 --> 14:49.990
that she was sexually abused
by her father?

14:50.023 --> 14:53.560
A diary, a doctor's note,
a police report, anything?

14:53.594 --> 14:56.362
I don't cross-examine
my patients.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.497
You took her
at her word.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.065
I feel that I can
usually tell

14:59.099 --> 15:01.167
when a patient is feigning
their symptoms, and--

15:01.201 --> 15:03.136
You took her
at her word.

15:05.606 --> 15:07.473
Yes, I did.

15:07.508 --> 15:09.175
Thank you, Dr. Starger.

15:10.476 --> 15:14.981
(indistinct chatter)

15:19.085 --> 15:20.220
Don't say a word to me.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.555
I think you look great.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.623
Never mind.

15:22.656 --> 15:23.624
You know, Bobby,

15:23.657 --> 15:25.692
it's a beautiful,
beautiful dress,

15:25.726 --> 15:29.162
but it's really designed to be
worn by a shorter person.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.632
Plus, the pressure of living up
to your mother's memory--

15:31.665 --> 15:34.000
She hates the dress.
I don't hate it.

15:34.034 --> 15:34.668
Why don't you just tell him?

15:34.701 --> 15:35.569
It looks like wallpaper.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.369
Ellenor.
Excuse me?

15:36.402 --> 15:37.604
It looks more like
a doily to me.

15:37.638 --> 15:38.705
Jimmy!
What?

15:38.739 --> 15:39.906
You know, those things you put
on the arm of the chair.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.708
Yeah, I know what a doily is,
but it doesn't look like that.

15:41.742 --> 15:43.544
Bobby, it's beautiful.

15:43.577 --> 15:45.345
Why don't you want
to wear it

15:45.378 --> 15:46.379
if we can have it altered?

15:46.412 --> 15:47.413
She hates it.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.115
I don't hate it.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.316
Lindsay, do you hate it?

15:52.619 --> 15:56.189
Well, I-I would just
rather wear the other one.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.195
No, I want you
to wear this one.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.205
Bobby...

16:13.206 --> 16:15.041
(door slams)

16:15.075 --> 16:16.577
with all due respect
to your mother,

16:16.610 --> 16:18.211
the decision
of what I wear

16:18.244 --> 16:19.312
really should be
my decision.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.383
Lindsay, this is
very personal to me.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.019
I get that.
I really do,

16:26.052 --> 16:27.453
but a wedding dress--

16:27.487 --> 16:30.323
it's-- it's very personal
to the bride, too.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.594
Lindsay, I don't ask
for much. One concession--

16:33.627 --> 16:35.028
You don't ask for much?

16:35.061 --> 16:36.597
You insist on
a Catholic wedding--

16:36.630 --> 16:38.298
I'm Catholic.
Well, I'm not.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.033
You picked out where
we'd have the reception...

16:40.066 --> 16:40.901
It's a place
near the Church.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.335
What we'd eat.
You said you
didn't care.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.070
On the dress,
I do care.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.506
I can't believe
you're doing this.

16:45.539 --> 16:49.075
Bobby, is this a partnership,
or do you dictate everything?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.512
I'm not dictating.
I'm asking for one damn thing.

16:51.545 --> 16:52.746
This is not one thing.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.414
Oh, it's typical
you'd be so stubborn.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.050
You have made every decision
without consulting me.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.218
Now you're telling me
that I have to wear

16:58.251 --> 17:00.220
your dead mother's doily?
Well, I'm not.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.722
I'm wearing the dress
that I picked out.

17:01.755 --> 17:02.789
If I have
to eat communion,

17:02.823 --> 17:04.424
you can swallow this.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.694
(door opens)

17:09.362 --> 17:10.830
(door slams)

17:10.864 --> 17:12.833
Can you describe
these flashbacks

17:12.866 --> 17:14.400
for the court?

17:16.269 --> 17:21.775
Well,
the most common one--

17:21.808 --> 17:26.112
I'm in my bed,
looking up at the ceiling

17:26.146 --> 17:30.751
at where my mother painted
clouds and a blue sky.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.089
and then the door opens
quietly,

17:37.591 --> 17:41.494
and I know it's my father.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.832
I keep staring at the clouds

17:45.866 --> 17:48.569
imagining myself
high above everything.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.372
I don't look down.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.708
I never look at him,

17:57.343 --> 17:59.746
but I feel him.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.383
And then...

18:04.685 --> 18:05.719
he's...

18:06.820 --> 18:11.357
he's inside me,
and it burns.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.530
I tell myself
to think about the clouds,

18:16.563 --> 18:18.765
think about heaven

18:18.799 --> 18:20.466
how much better
it'd be up there.

18:25.639 --> 18:27.473
Then I hear
mother's footsteps

18:27.508 --> 18:29.209
stopping
right outside my door.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.314
I scream,
but nothing comes out.

18:35.649 --> 18:39.152
I try to punch and kick,
but my arms and legs won't move.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.156
There's nothing I can do.

18:46.527 --> 18:50.130
And then the footsteps
fade away.

18:52.733 --> 18:55.902
And I'm there
alone with him again.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.376
Jan?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.479
Did you hate
your mother?

19:06.513 --> 19:07.881
No.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.584
I loved her.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.686
I wanted her
to love me,

19:12.719 --> 19:14.187
to save me.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.656
And when she didn't?

19:15.689 --> 19:18.659
I don't know.

19:18.692 --> 19:20.527
I never wanted
to kill her.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.631
I just wanted her
to love me.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.537
The night your mother
was killed--

19:30.571 --> 19:33.607
do you remember anything?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.843
I remember her
bringing out the cake.

19:36.877 --> 19:39.312
There were candles.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.748
You don't remember
picking up a knife?

19:41.782 --> 19:43.917
No.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.387
One second
there's a cake,

19:47.420 --> 19:51.457
the next, she's dying.

19:51.491 --> 19:55.261
I have no memory
of what happened.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.497
Was there something
about the cake

19:57.531 --> 20:00.601
that could've triggered
these old memories?

20:00.634 --> 20:02.402
I hated my birthdays.

20:03.604 --> 20:05.872
He'd always come in
on my birthdays.

20:09.610 --> 20:11.812
You used to work
as a draftsperson

20:11.845 --> 20:13.747
for a firm called
Madison and Company?

20:13.780 --> 20:14.681
Yes.

20:14.715 --> 20:18.952
And in 1995, you quit.
Could you tell us why?

20:18.985 --> 20:20.954
Their office had
fluorescent lighting

20:20.987 --> 20:22.589
that gave me migraines,

20:22.623 --> 20:24.891
which, ultimately,
became incapacitating.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.259
You spent
the next three months

20:26.292 --> 20:28.261
working for the architect
Dylan Wolf.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.062
Freelance.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.864
And according
to records there,

20:30.897 --> 20:34.400
you left because you feared
developing an ulcer.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.402
I was working
18 hours a day.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.038
It was extremely
stressful.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.806
I was worried
about an ulcer.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.674
And three months ago,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.943
you filed
a workman's compensation claim

20:42.976 --> 20:46.346
against your employer,
Baxter Design Corporation.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.748
You couldn't work

20:47.781 --> 20:49.783
because you hurt
your arm and shoulder.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.585
It's called
thoracic outlet syndrome.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.554
It happens
to architects, too.

20:53.587 --> 20:54.955
But, in fact,
Ms. Carlson,

20:54.988 --> 20:58.491
you were about to be fired
by Baxter Design.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.192
No.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.694
You went
to three specialists,

21:00.727 --> 21:03.630
and none could find
a medical reason for your pain.

21:03.664 --> 21:05.498
Objection.
What's the relevance of this?

21:05.532 --> 21:06.933
It goes to pattern.

21:06.967 --> 21:09.369
Every time the defendant

21:09.402 --> 21:11.404
is held responsible
for her behavior,

21:11.437 --> 21:13.940
she develops a mysterious
medical condition to blame.

21:13.974 --> 21:15.709
Objection.
Move to strike that.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.612
Get fired from the job,
blame thoracic outlet syndrome.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.013
Murder your mother
in cold blood,

21:20.046 --> 21:21.815
it's post-traumatic
stress disorder.

21:21.848 --> 21:22.916
REBECCA AND EUGENE:
Objection!

21:22.949 --> 21:24.050
Sustained.

21:25.752 --> 21:26.720
Ms. Carlson.

21:28.555 --> 21:33.426
Your mother left an estate,
valued at $2.3 million.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.929
Are you a beneficiary
of that inheritance?

21:38.098 --> 21:40.466
I inherit with my sister.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.401
Yes.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.907
(indistinct chatter)

21:48.441 --> 21:50.611
It's all consistent
with abuse survivors--

21:50.644 --> 21:52.345
ulcers, migraines.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.914
I say we recall
Dr. Starger.

21:53.947 --> 21:56.683
It won't matter. It looks
like she's making excuses.

21:56.717 --> 21:57.918
What about
her pediatrician?

21:57.951 --> 21:59.052
Her pediatrician?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.954
We got to show abuse occurred.
We still haven't proved--

22:00.987 --> 22:02.689
But he never
reported anything.

22:02.723 --> 22:04.057
Because they didn't
in those days.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.660
But there's evidence of symptoms
in her medical records.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.362
Look, she has urinary
infections, weight loss--

22:09.395 --> 22:11.031
Those symptoms
don't conclude abuse,

22:11.064 --> 22:12.733
and the pediatrician
will just testify

22:12.766 --> 22:14.367
he didn't see anything
to report.

22:17.838 --> 22:19.973
Excuse me.
Ms. Washington?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.975
My-- My name
is Steven Hatfield.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.910
I'm Brianna's husband.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.445
She's your client's
sister.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.880
Yes, I know.
How can I help you?

22:26.913 --> 22:30.416
Well, I'm not very comfortable
coming to you like this,

22:30.450 --> 22:32.753
but I understand
that Brianna testified

22:32.786 --> 22:35.121
that her father
never abused her.

22:35.155 --> 22:36.422
Yes.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.024
I believe that
to be a lie.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.000
I don't think
it's deliberate.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.536
I think she's been lying
to herself.

22:49.570 --> 22:51.137
About her being abused
as a child?

22:51.171 --> 22:55.408
Yes. I knew her dad.
A nicer guy you couldn't want,

22:55.441 --> 22:59.112
and I didn't want to believe
Jan's accusations about the guy,

22:59.145 --> 23:02.683
but it got me thinking
about some of the problems

23:02.716 --> 23:04.150
Brianna and I had had.

23:04.184 --> 23:06.152
What kind of problems?

23:06.820 --> 23:07.954
In the bedroom.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.591
Every time I would try
to bring the subject up,

23:10.624 --> 23:12.192
she'd shut me down.

23:12.225 --> 23:16.830
Either that or she would accuse
me of being 'over-sexed'.

23:18.565 --> 23:22.202
It got to a point where she
wouldn't even let me touch her.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.839
Then about six months ago,
she filed for divorce.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.808
Mr. Hatfield, there could be
a lot of reasons

23:27.841 --> 23:29.776
why you and your wife
had sexual problems.

23:29.810 --> 23:35.682
Yes, but she had this reflex
to being touched.

23:35.716 --> 23:38.084
Sitting in a chair
or lying in bed next to me,

23:38.118 --> 23:40.987
if she saw that I was about
to touch her,

23:41.021 --> 23:43.489
she'd be okay--

23:43.524 --> 23:46.126
not relaxed, but okay.

23:46.159 --> 23:48.862
But if I ever came up
on her from behind

23:48.895 --> 23:50.731
or touched her when she
didn't see it coming--

23:50.764 --> 23:51.998
even a touch on the arm--

23:53.499 --> 23:56.102
her whole body would contract.

23:56.136 --> 23:57.838
I always thought
it was possible

23:57.871 --> 23:59.906
she might be the victim
of some abuse,

23:59.940 --> 24:02.809
and I tried to get her
to talk to me about it,

24:03.944 --> 24:06.980
but she wouldn't go there.

24:07.013 --> 24:10.083
He's lying. He's trying
to get back at me or something.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.918
What motive would he have
to make this up?

24:11.952 --> 24:15.922
I don't know, but he's lying.
It never happened.

24:15.956 --> 24:19.893
Brianna...did it?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.928
No, Jan, he's lying.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.129
Brianna...

24:23.163 --> 24:26.099
Jan, you know Steven. He's got
to find blame for everything.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.701
This is just his way
of saying

24:27.734 --> 24:30.604
that the marriage failed
because of me.

24:30.637 --> 24:31.805
You know Steven.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.075
I don't believe her.

24:35.108 --> 24:38.044
I believe her, but maybe
she's repressed it.

24:38.078 --> 24:40.146
What if you hypnotized her?
Could that bring out--

24:40.180 --> 24:41.782
It doesn't sound like
she wants to be treated,

24:41.815 --> 24:44.117
and if so, I certainly
can't force her.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.986
But we can force her
to testify.

24:46.019 --> 24:47.688
But what good would that do?
She would just deny--

24:47.721 --> 24:48.889
how convincing
did you just find her?

24:48.922 --> 24:50.991
I don't want you
to be brutalizing my sister.

24:51.024 --> 24:53.560
Jan, her testimony
stands to convict you.

24:53.594 --> 24:55.929
She had to testify.
She was subpoenaed.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.664
It doesn't matter.
What she said was damaging.

24:57.698 --> 24:59.733
Plus, this is no time
to be protecting her.

24:59.766 --> 25:00.801
We got to recall her.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.135
And do what?

25:03.570 --> 25:04.605
Whatever we can.

25:09.142 --> 25:12.212
(horn blows)

25:12.245 --> 25:14.247
You didn't have
to get anti-Catholic.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.916
I wasn't anti-Catholic.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.751
I was referring to the length
of the ceremony,

25:17.784 --> 25:18.819
which I wanted to be short.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.555
Still, you take shots at
his mother and his religion?

25:21.588 --> 25:22.856
Don't you have work
to do?

25:22.889 --> 25:26.026
Why is it no one
ever wants my counsel?

25:26.627 --> 25:28.028
Lindsay, in my office.

25:28.729 --> 25:29.596
No.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.633
Excuse me?

25:32.766 --> 25:34.768
I said no. This is
a personal matter.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.237
You don't order me around
on personal matters.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.139
That's what
you need to get, Bobby.

25:39.172 --> 25:41.107
Well, you want to talk
about a personal matter

25:41.141 --> 25:42.242
in front
of everybody else?

25:42.275 --> 25:44.645
No, but I don't want
to be ordered.

25:44.678 --> 25:45.846
Why don't we pick
a neutral--

25:45.879 --> 25:47.280
Stay out of this.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.315
I'd love to.
Tell me where's a good spot.

25:49.349 --> 25:50.316
Jimmy, shut up.
You think you're funny?

25:50.350 --> 25:51.752
Hey, don't jump on him.

25:51.785 --> 25:52.819
You stay out
of it, too, Ellenor.

25:52.853 --> 25:55.021
We don't want to be in it.
Take this to another room.

25:55.055 --> 25:55.956
I tried to.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.223
Yeah, but you ordered her.

25:57.257 --> 25:58.091
BOBBY AND LINDSAY:
Quiet!

25:58.124 --> 25:59.092
Bite away.

25:59.793 --> 26:01.161
I'm leaving.

26:01.194 --> 26:04.064
Oh, there's
a mature response. Just...

26:04.097 --> 26:05.331
(door slams)

26:05.365 --> 26:06.600
leave.

26:09.670 --> 26:10.771
Do you know
what the expression

26:10.804 --> 26:12.639
"loss of consortium" means?

26:13.073 --> 26:14.074
I suppose.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.777
Your husband
Steven Hatfield claims

26:16.810 --> 26:20.080
your marriage failed because
of loss of consortium.

26:20.113 --> 26:23.216
You wouldn't have sex
with him. Is that true?

26:23.249 --> 26:24.651
No, it isn't.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.822
In the three years
since your father died,

26:28.855 --> 26:31.958
about how often did you
have sex with your husband?

26:31.992 --> 26:34.060
Do I have to answer
these questions?

26:34.094 --> 26:35.295
I'm sorry, you do.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.062
How often?

26:36.096 --> 26:37.764
I don't know.
Every few weeks.

26:37.798 --> 26:38.899
Objection.
What relevance is there--

26:38.932 --> 26:40.967
I'm trying to establish
a history of sexual dysfunction.

26:41.001 --> 26:42.235
It isn't true.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.004
I understand you don't
want to believe it.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.405
I don't want to believe it,
counselor,

26:45.438 --> 26:47.340
because it isn't true.

26:47.373 --> 26:51.144
Do you consider your sister
to be an honest person, Brianna?

26:51.177 --> 26:52.412
Yes.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.815
Ever known her to lie?

26:54.848 --> 26:57.283
No, except for this.

26:57.317 --> 26:58.919
"This" being her claim

26:58.952 --> 27:01.154
that she was sexually abused
by your father?

27:01.187 --> 27:01.922
Yes.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.389
And why would she lie
about this?

27:03.423 --> 27:05.225
I have no idea.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.360
No motive
to your knowledge?

27:07.393 --> 27:10.363
No.
Did you ever think,
well, maybe it happened?

27:10.396 --> 27:13.333
No.
It ever happen to you?

27:13.366 --> 27:14.367
No.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.802
He never opened your door
and came into your room?

27:15.836 --> 27:16.503
No, he didn't.

27:16.537 --> 27:17.838
He never crawled
into your bed?

27:17.871 --> 27:18.805
No.

27:18.839 --> 27:22.275
Because if he did,
and you never said anything,

27:22.308 --> 27:24.410
I guess you'd feel
a little responsible

27:24.444 --> 27:26.046
for him moving on
to your younger sister.

27:26.079 --> 27:26.913
He never did that.

27:26.947 --> 27:28.815
Did what, come into
your room or Jan's?

27:28.849 --> 27:31.051
Either. It never happened.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.919
You know for a fact
it didn't happen with Jan?

27:32.953 --> 27:34.354
Now, how do you know that
for a fact?

27:34.387 --> 27:36.222
I don't believe
that it happened.

27:36.256 --> 27:37.090
So, it's possible?

27:37.123 --> 27:38.358
No, it's not possible.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.126
So, you know
for a fact again?
Objection!

27:40.160 --> 27:41.227
I know for a certainty.

27:41.261 --> 27:42.696
And that's different
than for a fact?

27:42.729 --> 27:45.131
Your honor!
All right, Mr. Young.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.433
Ms. Hatfield,
previously, you testified

27:47.467 --> 27:49.469
that when your mother
and Jan started to argue,

27:49.503 --> 27:51.738
you fled the house. Why?

27:51.772 --> 27:53.840
I just didn't want
to hear them fighting.

27:53.874 --> 27:55.241
So, you didn't want
to stay in the house

27:55.275 --> 27:57.177
and listen to talk
about your father

27:57.210 --> 27:58.378
sexually abusing Jan?

27:58.411 --> 27:59.546
That's right.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.214
You just ran out of the house,
didn't want to deal with it?

28:01.447 --> 28:03.149
No.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.151
Do you love
your sister Jan?

28:05.185 --> 28:06.853
Of course I do.

28:06.887 --> 28:10.023
Somebody you love claims
she was sexually abused,

28:10.056 --> 28:11.491
and you don't even want
to talk about it?

28:11.525 --> 28:13.326
You run
from the discussion?

28:13.359 --> 28:17.798
I don't believe
she was sexually abused.

28:17.831 --> 28:20.000
Well, did you ever
counsel her to get help?

28:20.033 --> 28:22.468
I mean, if she thinks
she was sexually abused

28:22.503 --> 28:24.738
or lies about it--
somebody you love--

28:24.771 --> 28:26.439
did you ever try
to help her

28:26.472 --> 28:28.341
or see that
she got help?

28:33.980 --> 28:35.015
No.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.352
Truth is, you didn't want
to go near this subject,

28:39.385 --> 28:40.453
did you, Brianna?

28:40.486 --> 28:43.023
You had to run out of this room
every time it happened

28:43.056 --> 28:43.790
because he touched you.

28:43.824 --> 28:44.758
Asked and answered.
No, he didn't.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.326
Just like you want
to run out of the room now.

28:46.359 --> 28:47.327
He never touched me!

28:47.360 --> 28:48.494
She's on trial for
murder here, and you're going

28:48.529 --> 28:51.131
to let her go down just like
you let him go into her room--

28:51.164 --> 28:51.865
Stop it!

28:51.898 --> 28:52.866
Why can't you
admit it happened?

28:52.899 --> 28:55.001
Why didn't you
make him stop?
Carlson, sit down.

28:55.035 --> 28:56.136
You could've made
daddy stop!

28:56.169 --> 28:57.538
JUDGE CAMP: Enough!

28:57.571 --> 29:00.440
I didn't have
to feel alone.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.075
You gave your sister
to him, Brianna.

29:02.108 --> 29:02.809
Objection!
No, I didn't!

29:02.843 --> 29:04.377
Mr. Young!
I didn't do anything!

29:04.410 --> 29:05.779
You let him crawl
into your bed

29:05.812 --> 29:06.847
just the way he crawled
into yours.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.881
Get away from me!

29:13.086 --> 29:14.320
You get away!

29:25.866 --> 29:27.467
Look at your sister,
Brianna.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.274
You can't even look
at her.

29:36.309 --> 29:38.311
She needs you
to remember.

29:42.115 --> 29:43.817
Please get away from me.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.267
It's a dress.

30:01.301 --> 30:04.204
Exactly. So, what's the big deal
about me wearing it?

30:04.237 --> 30:05.205
Well, that's my question.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.140
What's the big deal to you
about wearing it

30:07.173 --> 30:08.842
when you know
how important it is to me?

30:08.875 --> 30:10.911
Why the hell
isn't it important to you

30:10.944 --> 30:13.514
how I feel
on my wedding day?

30:13.547 --> 30:15.248
Did you ever stop
to consider, Bobby,

30:15.281 --> 30:17.483
that it's my day, too,
or is it only your day,

30:17.518 --> 30:19.019
like it's only
your marriage?

30:19.052 --> 30:20.153
What's that
supposed to mean?

30:20.186 --> 30:21.888
It means that you don't look
at this like a partnership,

30:21.922 --> 30:24.190
or if you do, you consider
yourself a senior partner.

30:24.224 --> 30:25.258
Well, if it's going
to be that, Bobby--

30:25.291 --> 30:27.160
Lindsay,
what is wrong with you?

30:27.193 --> 30:28.394
What's wrong with me?

30:28.428 --> 30:30.463
Yes, you're acting
like a crazy person.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.032
I mean,
is this just stress?

30:32.065 --> 30:34.535
Don't blame this
on stress or PMS

30:34.568 --> 30:35.736
or whatever other label you
want to hang on to justify--

30:35.769 --> 30:37.403
I'm just trying to talk to you,
and you're screaming at me.

30:37.437 --> 30:39.239
I hate the way
you proposed to me!

30:51.652 --> 30:54.220
It came out of trauma,
and that's--

30:55.388 --> 30:58.224
I-- You're so guarded,

30:58.258 --> 30:59.259
so...

31:01.595 --> 31:05.298
you keep your emotions
in a vault.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.633
It took
some-- some catastrophe

31:06.667 --> 31:08.301
to set them loose
when I got stabbed,

31:08.334 --> 31:10.303
but that was just
a fluke.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.639
Do I have to get on a deathbed
for you to unlock--

31:12.673 --> 31:15.576
Lindsay,
what is going on?

31:20.947 --> 31:22.248
When you lost
your mother--

31:24.384 --> 31:25.952
I don't know. I--

31:28.288 --> 31:30.056
It must've been
some kind of pain.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.263
From what I gather,
you two...

31:42.068 --> 31:43.369
I don't think
you'll ever risk

31:43.403 --> 31:45.071
getting hurt
like that again.

31:45.105 --> 31:46.507
I don't think
you'll ever let somebody

31:46.540 --> 31:49.075
become this center
of your life.

31:50.644 --> 31:53.313
You'll lose too much control
or something.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.182
What are you telling me?

31:58.752 --> 32:00.153
You don't want a partner.

32:00.186 --> 32:03.023
You want an accessory

32:03.056 --> 32:04.558
to compliment your life,
not...

32:11.364 --> 32:12.699
I don't want in
on that.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.969
I don't want to end up

32:17.671 --> 32:19.272
marooned on your island.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.083
Maybe we should
call this off.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.354
You don't want to--

32:34.387 --> 32:37.490
you don't want
to get married?

32:38.659 --> 32:39.693
No.

32:52.246 --> 32:54.107
Imagine you're 9.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.542
It's your birthday,

32:55.576 --> 32:58.178
and your mother brings out
your birthday cake

32:58.211 --> 33:01.748
and tells you to make a wish
before you blow out the candles.

33:01.782 --> 33:07.721
Do you wish for a new bike,
a doll you saw at a toy store?

33:07.754 --> 33:09.756
Jan Carlson
wished her father

33:09.790 --> 33:13.226
would stop forcing her
to have sex with him.

33:13.259 --> 33:16.296
She prayed for someone
to protect her

33:16.329 --> 33:18.198
from this nightmare.

33:18.231 --> 33:21.401
But not long after she blew out
the birthday candles,

33:21.434 --> 33:24.605
her father would creep
into her bedroom

33:24.638 --> 33:29.242
with one last gift
to give her.

33:29.275 --> 33:32.345
So, she picks up a knife

33:32.378 --> 33:34.280
and murders her mother--

33:35.315 --> 33:36.817
not her father,

33:36.850 --> 33:39.686
the one who supposedly committed
these horrific acts--

33:39.720 --> 33:41.387
her mother.

33:41.421 --> 33:42.556
And then trots out,

33:42.589 --> 33:44.625
"Hey, I was abused
as a child."

33:44.658 --> 33:47.493
Post-traumatic
stress disorder,

33:47.528 --> 33:49.295
and that's a good one.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.164
We see all kinds

33:51.197 --> 33:53.433
of imaginative defenses
these days.

33:53.466 --> 33:58.104
We have rape trauma syndrome,
battered wives syndrome,

33:58.138 --> 34:01.274
steroid rage, Prozac defense.

34:01.307 --> 34:05.679
There are as many disorders
as there are crimes these days,

34:05.712 --> 34:09.449
and they all amount
to the same thing--

34:09.482 --> 34:13.353
Escaping responsibility.

34:13.386 --> 34:15.522
This isn't something
she invented.

34:15.556 --> 34:17.791
You heard the expert
medical testimony.

34:17.824 --> 34:21.261
Jan Carlson's mind
was gone that night.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.864
She was suddenly reliving
an awful memory,

34:24.898 --> 34:28.702
a horrible memory
of sexual abuse.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.536
You listened to Jan.

34:30.571 --> 34:33.438
You listened to Dr. Starger,

34:33.473 --> 34:34.440
and you listened

34:34.474 --> 34:37.409
to her sister Brianna,
didn't you?

34:37.443 --> 34:41.181
The power of a mind
to fight off a memory.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.551
For three years,

34:44.585 --> 34:48.121
Bernard Carlson
entered Jan's room.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.891
For three years,
her mother knew

34:50.924 --> 34:52.525
and did nothing.

34:53.594 --> 34:56.496
And on February 9th,

34:56.530 --> 35:00.100
Jan's mind,
caught in that memory,

35:01.167 --> 35:02.468
just snapped.

35:04.337 --> 35:05.539
She snapped.

35:06.540 --> 35:08.642
And after snapping,

35:08.675 --> 35:11.778
she stands to inherit
more than $1 million.

35:11.812 --> 35:13.647
She either did it
for the money,

35:13.680 --> 35:15.616
or she did it
for revenge.

35:15.649 --> 35:17.618
Either way,
it's murder one.

35:21.922 --> 35:23.156
Where's Bobby?

35:23.189 --> 35:23.824
He's in his office.

35:23.857 --> 35:25.258
Tell him I'm here.

35:27.794 --> 35:29.162
What are you
going to do?

35:29.195 --> 35:30.263
Who said
it was your business?

35:30.296 --> 35:32.365
My friend, my business.
What are you going to do?

35:32.398 --> 35:34.500
Helen, she left me.
There's nothing I can do.

35:34.535 --> 35:38.304
Listen to me.
When you and I were dating,

35:38.338 --> 35:42.475
I got this sense that you
had it all figured out--

35:42.509 --> 35:44.578
how life would be,
how it should be.

35:44.611 --> 35:47.581
And when you found somebody
who fit nicely

35:47.614 --> 35:49.883
into your little life plan,
you'd get married.

35:49.916 --> 35:52.385
Now, I knew I would
never be the one

35:52.418 --> 35:53.720
to just fill that slot.

35:53.754 --> 35:55.388
Thank you, Helen.
I'm not interested--

35:55.421 --> 35:56.422
Bobby, would you
listen to me?

35:56.456 --> 35:58.892
I might not have another
chance to interfere, okay?

35:58.925 --> 36:01.662
Lindsay's not going to slide
into any slot, either,

36:01.695 --> 36:03.964
and your life might not
fit her any better

36:03.997 --> 36:06.900
than your mother's dress,
but if you love her--

36:06.933 --> 36:08.034
Helen, if you don't
let go of me--

36:08.068 --> 36:11.237
Bobby, do you want to spend
the rest of your life alone?

36:11.271 --> 36:12.372
As much as I love her,

36:12.405 --> 36:14.508
she's not the one
I'm worried about.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.276
She's the greatest woman
I know.

36:16.309 --> 36:19.312
She'll find somebody,
probably better than you.

36:19.913 --> 36:20.947
Thank you.

36:20.981 --> 36:23.917
But you're not going to find
anybody better than her.

36:23.950 --> 36:26.419
I know it, and you know it.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.489
Let her be
your partner, Bobby,

36:29.523 --> 36:32.258
not just because
it's what she wants--

36:33.694 --> 36:35.195
because it's what you need.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.434
How much longer?

36:44.037 --> 36:45.672
We don't know.

36:45.706 --> 36:47.240
There's no way
of telling.

36:47.641 --> 36:50.010
(sighs)

36:50.043 --> 36:52.478
Tell me something good,
Rebecca.

36:52.513 --> 36:54.380
I need to hear
something good.

36:57.283 --> 36:58.585
(knock on door)

37:11.598 --> 37:12.766
I'm sorry.

37:19.606 --> 37:23.443
I'm sorry I made you
feel so alone.

37:23.476 --> 37:25.979
Do you remember?

37:26.012 --> 37:27.514
I don't know, Jan.

37:30.617 --> 37:33.720
But I think I need
someone to help me.

37:33.754 --> 37:35.255
You remember.

37:38.324 --> 37:41.928
I'm sorry, Janny.

37:41.962 --> 37:42.996
Jury's back.

37:45.832 --> 37:47.500
(sighs)

37:56.442 --> 37:57.978
Will the defendant
please rise?

38:00.847 --> 38:02.783
Mr. Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

38:03.584 --> 38:04.718
We have, Your Honor.

38:04.751 --> 38:06.553
What say you?

38:06.587 --> 38:12.325
On the count 42113,
murder in the first degree,

38:12.358 --> 38:16.663
we the jury find
the defendant Jan Carlson...

38:16.697 --> 38:17.998
not guilty.

38:18.031 --> 38:19.465
(indistinct chatter)

38:19.499 --> 38:24.938
On the count 42114,
murder in the second degree,

38:24.971 --> 38:28.609
we the jury find
the defendant Jan Carlson...

38:29.109 --> 38:30.443
not guilty.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.613
(sobbing)

38:33.847 --> 38:35.481
The defendant is released.

38:35.516 --> 38:37.684
The jury is dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

38:37.718 --> 38:39.620
We are adjourned.
(pounds gavel)

38:54.400 --> 38:57.504
(door opens)

39:13.453 --> 39:17.624
I haven't totally
figured out

39:17.658 --> 39:19.125
how to let people
in my life.

39:21.695 --> 39:23.697
Everything you said--

39:23.730 --> 39:25.131
the things you fear--

39:27.934 --> 39:29.069
probably all true.

39:31.204 --> 39:34.040
But this idea that I, uh,

39:34.074 --> 39:37.410
I don't want to share
my life,

39:37.443 --> 39:39.946
that I don't want
a partner--

39:40.814 --> 39:42.849
that I reject.

39:48.522 --> 39:49.956
I love you, Lindsay.

39:52.092 --> 39:57.163
Whatever I have to do
to convince you of that...

39:59.099 --> 40:03.770
to earn the right
to go on loving you

40:05.038 --> 40:08.942
for the rest of my life...

40:10.511 --> 40:12.979
I'll do it.

40:17.618 --> 40:19.686
Please...

40:22.188 --> 40:24.625
marry me.

40:37.070 --> 40:40.440
I won't wear that dress.

40:43.143 --> 40:44.711
Forget the dress.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.756
You have to let me in.

40:59.793 --> 41:00.927
I will.

41:05.932 --> 41:09.603
Okay. Let's get married.

41:20.180 --> 41:26.019
(siren blows)

41:27.253 --> 41:29.790
(radio chatter)

41:30.957 --> 41:33.827
(siren blows)

41:33.860 --> 41:38.765
(radio chatter)

41:40.834 --> 41:44.170
(radio chatter)

41:47.608 --> 41:48.374
What happened?

41:48.408 --> 41:50.276
They picked up
some food for dinner.

41:50.310 --> 41:51.945
Brianna came out
of the restaurant,

41:51.978 --> 41:53.914
started walking
to the car,

41:53.947 --> 41:56.817
and she says she saw
her father

41:56.850 --> 41:58.619
and just gunned
the accelerator.

41:59.953 --> 42:01.287
10 people witnessed it.

42:03.056 --> 42:04.758
She ran over Brianna.

42:06.159 --> 42:07.794
Congratulations.

42:07.828 --> 42:10.864
She really does
have a disorder.

42:10.897 --> 42:12.966
You got her off.

42:12.999 --> 42:14.300
You couldn't have
got her some help?

42:16.169 --> 42:22.008
(indistinct chatter)

42:35.321 --> 42:37.023
Jan?

42:37.057 --> 42:38.258
I don't remember.

42:40.026 --> 42:42.295
I saw him, and then...

42:43.664 --> 42:44.965
is it really Bri?

42:49.069 --> 42:50.136
Yeah.

42:52.172 --> 42:54.374
Is she going to be okay?

42:54.407 --> 42:56.643
She's going to be okay,
right?

43:00.246 --> 43:02.749
Tell me something good,
Rebecca.

43:02.783 --> 43:05.151
I need to hear
something good.

43:05.251 --> 43:06.787
(gasps)

43:07.954 --> 43:09.656
Tell me something good.

43:11.725 --> 43:14.595
Tell me something good.

43:15.428 --> 43:16.863
Tell me something good.

43:23.436 --> 43:26.707
(music playing)

43:49.996 --> 43:50.997
You stinker!
