been to anything like this.

for a fact she has.

25:03.533 --> 25:06.700
I don't like the way that
Teddi's been acting towards me.

25:06.734 --> 25:08.600
I don't like the way
she's been giving me attitude.

25:08.633 --> 25:12.133
She's just gotten a little big
for her britches.

25:14.667 --> 25:18.166
And then to take jabs at me
saying stuff about, like,

25:18.200 --> 25:20.667
"Why are you wishy-washy
about how I feel,

25:20.700 --> 25:22.233
"whether I'm gonna pick
a side with this thing

25:22.266 --> 25:24.467
with Lisa Vanderpump?"

25:24.500 --> 25:26.066
I've been around
Lisa Vanderpump

25:26.100 --> 25:27.600
and Kyle
and their relationship...

25:27.633 --> 25:29.600
- For years.
- For a very, very long time.

25:29.633 --> 25:31.700
I see Vanderpump's
point of view.

25:31.734 --> 25:33.734
I feel for Kyle.

25:33.767 --> 25:36.767
So I know the dynamic...

25:37.000 --> 25:38.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Of the relationship,

25:38.533 --> 25:40.600
and, you know,
Lisa has been there for me,

25:40.633 --> 25:42.667
and she has been there
for Kyle.

25:42.700 --> 25:46.633
- Just listen to you guys.
- Women, right?

25:46.667 --> 25:49.200
- Complex.
- It is, isn't it?

25:49.233 --> 25:51.600
Isn't it just...
- I mean, unbelievable.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.233
- Do I say anything to Teddi?
I don't know.

25:54.266 --> 25:55.734
- I think you should
address it.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.000
- It just makes me feel
uncomfortable.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.200
It's just one of those things.

25:58.233 --> 26:00.567
Do I bring it up
and have her bark at me?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.533
- Oh, it's such a fine line.
I don't know.

26:02.567 --> 26:05.033
- Can she take criticism?
I'm not sure if she can.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.600
But she's
an accountability coach.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.533
Go figure.

26:11.567 --> 26:14.066
- Well, so is Camille invited

26:14.100 --> 26:17.567
on this trip, or...
- Of course she's invited.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.000
Obviously right now Camille's
not on the best of terms

26:21.033 --> 26:22.600
with everyone,
but I think that if I were to

26:22.633 --> 26:24.600
go out of my way
not to invite Camille,

26:24.633 --> 26:26.600
that's really making
a statement.

26:26.633 --> 26:29.233
- Of course. We're gonna beat
her up in France.

Well, if only hookers
looked like you, see?

a lot of them do,

especially if they're Russian.

I'm not lying.
They're gorgeous.

Not that I'm saying
I'm gorgeous,

are trouble together,"

27:57.767 --> 27:59.133

"No, we had the best time.

What are you talking about?"

so much in common.

Brandi and I
have a mutual friend.

That's how the two of us met.

28:05.033 --> 28:07.100
We went to dinner one night,
hit it off.

28:07.133 --> 28:09.633
I think she's crazy fun,
and I like her.

So I was looking
at your Instagram,

28:37.000 --> 28:38.233
and you were
with Patrick Muldoon.

28:38.266 --> 28:39.400
- Yes.
- But, like,

28:39.433 --> 28:41.033
didn't you guys date?
- Yeah.

28:41.066 --> 28:42.367
- I'm looking at
your Instagram,

28:42.400 --> 28:44.300
and I'm thinking,
"These two used to (BLEEP)."

28:44.333 --> 28:46.233
How the (BLEEP)
is your husband handling that?

28:46.266 --> 28:48.100
- You know what?
You're so funny to say that.

28:48.133 --> 28:49.333
- No. I'm being serious.

28:49.367 --> 28:52.066
- No.
My husband's so supportive.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.734
He seems
so fine with all of that.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.433
- They all seem fine
until they're not fine.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.066
- They're really not?
You know what?

28:58.100 --> 28:59.233
If it was the reverse,
I probably would be

28:59.266 --> 29:00.367
upset with Aaron.
- Absolutely.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.266
- Like, if he did that, I think

29:02.300 --> 29:03.767
I would have been ----ing mad.
- I would kill him.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.367
- Eddie Cibrian said
you slit his tires.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.667
Is that true?
- Yeah.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.500
- Okay. Oh. Okay.

29:08.533 --> 29:12.166
- We need more--we need drinks
upon drinks upon drinks.

At Casamigos, I apparently
punched someone in the face,

29:16.166 --> 29:19.100
which I did not do.

29:21.533 --> 29:25.667
Listen. I admit that
I might have slapped

29:25.700 --> 29:28.500
a pretty English older woman
in the face once.

29:28.533 --> 29:32.400
- Pick on somebody
your own--No.

29:32.433 --> 29:34.200
- But I'm not out
in the streets, like,

29:34.233 --> 29:35.400
punching dudes in the face.

29:35.433 --> 29:38.066
The guy told the cops
the next day

29:38.100 --> 29:39.400
that I had nothing
to do with it,

29:39.433 --> 29:41.333
I didn't witness it,
and I wasn't even there.

29:41.367 --> 29:45.100
- That's awful. This is why
this stuff is so ----ed up.

29:45.133 --> 29:47.066
It's ----ed up.
- It's terrible.

29:47.100 --> 29:50.433
There was some story
that they think Lisa Vanderpump

29:50.467 --> 29:52.367
planted in--I think
it was "Radar Online"

29:52.400 --> 29:54.000
or one of those--"Daily Mail"
or whatever.

29:54.033 --> 29:55.200
- She does have a direct
hotline

29:55.233 --> 29:57.066
to "Radar Online,"
to be honest.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.734
- And I don't know her well
enough to know

29:58.767 --> 30:01.166
if she leaked it or not.
- Well, she did, for sure.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.500
And of course
she's gonna like you,

30:02.533 --> 30:03.700
'cause you're young
and pretty and blunt,

30:03.734 --> 30:04.734
and she likes pretty things.

30:04.767 --> 30:06.066
- Mm-hmm.
- She liked

30:06.100 --> 30:08.033
Dorit, she likes me.

30:08.066 --> 30:10.433
Lisa Vanderpump and I were best
friends for five years.

30:10.467 --> 30:12.133
Let's be clear.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.166
- What is this? "Super Strap"?
- Oh, yes.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.300
- You put it
over your mattress.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.467
- I slip and slide?

30:16.500 --> 30:18.133
- You put it over
your mattress.

30:18.166 --> 30:19.767
- Who am I gonna slip
and slide with?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.300
- After do a shot of tequila.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.200
- [laughing]

30:23.233 --> 30:25.266
Do not put him there.
It's not safe.

30:25.300 --> 30:28.100
- Where's the peanut butter?
- Get him out--

30:28.133 --> 30:30.300
Thank you for being a friend.
No, I mean it.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.467
No, you are
a good friend to me.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.200
Exactly. Thank you. Thank you.

30:34.233 --> 30:37.166
- I love you.
- Thank you. I love you too.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.266
- Whatever she wants out there,
she gets out there.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.734
We were leaving for Palm
Springs, and Lisa was there.

30:42.767 --> 30:45.066
I had the tabloids at my house.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.734
She goes,
"You need to bring this."

30:46.767 --> 30:49.333
And she put it back
in my luggage.

30:49.367 --> 30:52.200
If you cross her in any way...

30:52.233 --> 30:54.133
- Mm-hmm.
- Which I did...

30:54.166 --> 30:56.567
- Well, did you cross her, or
did you stand up for yourself?

30:56.600 --> 30:58.300
- A little bit of both.

30:58.333 --> 30:59.533
- But that's--
- No. I kind of crossed her.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.467
- You did?
- I said,

31:01.500 --> 31:04.200
"You're not telling the truth
in this situation."

31:04.233 --> 31:06.133
- I want to know the truth

31:06.166 --> 31:08.000
about the tabloids
in the suitcase.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.166
- I didn't see the tabloids
until I got back.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.100
- No, that's not true.

31:13.133 --> 31:15.467
Literally,
the past three years

31:15.500 --> 31:19.066
being punished
for crossing her in a way...

31:19.100 --> 31:20.767
- Why would she do that
to her friend, though?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.033
- She really, in her head,
does nothing wrong.

31:23.066 --> 31:24.467
- All right.
I have another round

31:24.500 --> 31:26.000
for you guys.
- Oh, thank you.

31:26.033 --> 31:27.433
- I think we need
food though too.

31:27.467 --> 31:31.033
- I want some carbs
with some oil and salt.

31:31.066 --> 31:32.500
- I think I might
do a salad too.

31:32.533 --> 31:34.367
- Thank you, hon.
- You're welcome.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.233

"hot difficult" at all.

- Okay. Here. Cheers.
- Cheers, bitch.

31:37.567 --> 31:39.266
- I--cheers, bitch.

Maybe you should come
with us on our trip.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.600
We're going to Provence.

31:42.633 --> 31:46.367
- Provence.
- We're going wine tasting.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.233
- Oh, (BLEEP). I'm in.
- Sure. You can come.

31:50.266 --> 31:52.200
- Great.

31:52.233 --> 31:54.500
- I have some carbs
for you guys.

31:54.533 --> 31:57.433
- Thank you.
- Can you give me a double?

31:57.467 --> 32:00.066
- Two glasses?
- In one.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.400
- Two glasses in one?

32:01.433 --> 32:03.400
- If you bring me two glasses,
I will kill you.

32:03.433 --> 32:05.066
- Okay. Okay.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.333
- And do you want another one?

32:06.367 --> 32:07.533
- Yeah.
- I will in a minute.

32:07.567 --> 32:09.400
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:09.433 --> 32:11.233
- Brandi could drink me
under the table for sure.

32:11.266 --> 32:13.400
I sip it.
I don't do shots of tequila.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.600
I ----ing sip that sh--.
I know how much to sip.

32:16.633 --> 32:20.000
- So Kim called me,
and I was like,

32:20.033 --> 32:21.266
"What are you talking about?

32:21.300 --> 32:22.500
She's the sweetest person
ever."

32:22.533 --> 32:24.133
- Oh, about me?
- Yes.

32:24.166 --> 32:25.500
- She told me how much
she liked me,

32:25.533 --> 32:28.200
but probably not anymore.
- I know Lisa so well,

32:28.233 --> 32:31.000
and I know she doesn't have
a mean bone in her body.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.300
- Oh!
- I really do.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.033
No, Kim, she doesn't.

32:34.066 --> 32:36.000
- You don't know what
she's done to me.

32:36.033 --> 32:38.467
- She's like, "That bitch,"
and I'm like, "Oh, my God."

32:38.500 --> 32:41.233
- But why am I a bitch?
I was trying to reassure her

32:41.266 --> 32:43.633
that Lisa Rinna
didn't mean anything by it.

32:43.667 --> 32:46.467
- You know what?
I want to say one thing, Kim.

32:46.500 --> 32:49.500
You giving Lisa Rinna
that bunny was really (BLEEP).

32:49.533 --> 32:53.100
- [gasps]
- Was it bad timing? Probably.

32:53.133 --> 32:55.300
Was it the right thing to say?
Probably not.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.166
