WEBVTT

00:04.660 --> 00:08.646
Okay, salute the sun.

00:10.666 --> 00:12.867
Deep cleansing breath.

00:15.153 --> 00:17.789
Release your
negative energy.

00:17.791 --> 00:20.508
Oh, I'd better not.

00:20.510 --> 00:23.461
The only thing holding me
together is negative energy.

00:23.463 --> 00:25.630
And into downward dog.

00:28.335 --> 00:29.918
Knees straight.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.669
Extend your hips.

00:31.671 --> 00:32.804
I'm trying, I'm trying.

00:32.806 --> 00:34.222
I can't...
I can't straighten my legs.

00:34.224 --> 00:35.706
All right.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.592
Let me just help
you out here.

00:39.378 --> 00:41.062
That's it.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.480
That's it.

00:42.482 --> 00:44.933
Just let it go.

00:44.935 --> 00:47.018
Let it go.

00:47.020 --> 00:50.772
Shall I light some candles
and put on some music?

00:50.774 --> 00:53.775
We're doing yoga.

00:53.777 --> 00:57.112
It's none of my business--
just put a towel down.

00:57.114 --> 00:59.730
Oh, Berta, that's the doorbell.

00:59.732 --> 01:02.500
Heard it--
not getting it.

01:02.502 --> 01:04.251
Yeah, I'll get it.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.837
I need a break anyway.

01:05.839 --> 01:07.405
It's only been five minutes.

01:07.407 --> 01:10.341
Uh, not the first time
I've heard that.

01:10.343 --> 01:11.426
Hey, Al.

01:11.428 --> 01:13.294
Oh, hey, Herb,
what brings you by?

01:13.296 --> 01:15.196
Oh, you, uh, left
your wallet at my house.

01:15.198 --> 01:16.931
I didn't even
notice it was missing.

01:16.933 --> 01:19.350
Really? It's been over a week.

01:21.220 --> 01:24.472
Hard to notice something's
missing when you never use it.

01:25.357 --> 01:26.424
Well, thank you.

01:26.426 --> 01:27.525
Oh, no problem.

01:27.527 --> 01:29.760
Hey, I want to apologize
for my behavior lately.

01:29.762 --> 01:32.697
I've been in a real dark place
since Judith left.

01:32.699 --> 01:33.948
No apologies necessary.

01:33.950 --> 01:35.766
Uh, the important thing is
you're feeling better.

01:35.768 --> 01:37.435
Well, I'm not putting
her nightgown on a pillow

01:37.437 --> 01:39.687
and spooning it
anymore so, uh,

01:39.689 --> 01:41.789
yeah, coming out
of the darkness.

01:41.791 --> 01:44.242
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:45.328 --> 01:47.378
Wh-what is it?
Is it your back?

01:47.380 --> 01:48.997
No, it's my front.

01:48.999 --> 01:51.299
I need a Doctor.
Right here.

01:51.301 --> 01:52.783
No, a real doctor.

01:52.785 --> 01:53.885
Right here, right here.

01:53.887 --> 01:54.836
Where does it hurt?

01:54.838 --> 01:57.055
Uh, it's my balls.
Oh.

01:57.057 --> 01:59.624
I'm gonna have to stick
my hands down your pants.

01:59.626 --> 02:03.061
For once I'm glad I didn't
make it into medical school.

02:03.063 --> 02:05.013
Make it stop, make it stop.

02:05.015 --> 02:07.265
Ooh. A little swampy down here.

02:07.267 --> 02:10.351
I wasn't expecting company.

02:10.353 --> 02:12.187
Oh, oh, I see.

02:12.189 --> 02:13.905
You've got a twist
in your spermatic chord.

02:13.907 --> 02:15.607
I'm gonna have to perform

02:15.609 --> 02:18.276
a manual detorsion
on your testes.

02:18.278 --> 02:19.410
What does that mean?

02:19.412 --> 02:21.079
Your nuts are in a knot--
I need to untie them.

02:21.081 --> 02:23.331
No, no, no.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.200
Look, it's either that or your
blood supply'll be cut off.

02:25.202 --> 02:26.451
You might lose a testicle.

02:26.453 --> 02:28.536
Go, man, go.

02:28.538 --> 02:31.656
Uh, remember, rigthy tighty,
lefty loosey.

02:31.658 --> 02:33.925
This reminds me of the summers
of my youth.

02:33.927 --> 02:35.793
I used to pick peaches on my...

02:35.795 --> 02:37.128
Will you just do it?!

02:39.499 --> 02:41.599
Ah, that feels good.

02:41.601 --> 02:44.652
Ah, I love you, Herb.

02:44.654 --> 02:46.671
We're gonna need a code word

02:46.673 --> 02:50.358
so I stop walking
in on this stuff.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.644

03:03.427 --> 03:05.712
Got the ice.
It's crushed.

03:05.714 --> 03:07.881
Kind of like your balls.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.450
That is the worst pain
I've ever experienced.

03:10.452 --> 03:12.852
Says the only guy in this room
who wasn't married to Judith.

03:18.309 --> 03:19.976
There you go.
Whoa!

03:19.978 --> 03:22.812
And just like that,
I'm a grower, not a shower.

03:22.814 --> 03:25.565
I know it's uncomfortable but
you need to ice the soreness

03:25.567 --> 03:26.950
for 20 minutes
every couple hours

03:26.952 --> 03:28.234
and avoid sudden movements.

03:28.236 --> 03:30.336
How did this happen?

03:30.338 --> 03:32.989
Well, imagine your testicles

03:32.991 --> 03:35.492
hanging like wind chimes.

03:35.494 --> 03:39.045
Most days they sway gently and
you hear a beautiful melody.

03:40.331 --> 03:42.932
Other days the wind kicks up
and, uh, they get twisted

03:42.934 --> 03:46.186
and it sounds like a washing
machine full of cowbells.

03:46.188 --> 03:47.670
Am I gonna be okay?

03:47.672 --> 03:49.389
Oh, yeah, don't worry,
but just to make sure

03:49.391 --> 03:50.623
you should stop by
my office tomorrow.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.008
We'll do an ultrasound.

03:52.010 --> 03:55.011
Why do you need an ultrasound
in a pediatrician's office?

03:55.013 --> 03:57.146
Well, when a kid swallows
a Matchbox car,

03:57.148 --> 03:59.182
you need to know whether it's
gonna drive out on its own

03:59.184 --> 04:00.767
or has to be airlifted.

04:08.943 --> 04:10.693
Well, good news.

04:10.695 --> 04:12.612
Everything looks
completely normal.

04:12.614 --> 04:14.113
And speaking as a medical
professional,

04:14.115 --> 04:16.499
your junk is extraordinary.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.618
Uh, thank you.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.786
I didn't know whether
to examine it

04:19.788 --> 04:21.921
or feed it a peanut.

04:23.791 --> 04:24.874
Okay, I'm gonna...

04:24.876 --> 04:27.126
I'm gonna put my clothes on now.

04:27.128 --> 04:29.045
You should avoid strenuous
activity and I'd, uh,

04:29.047 --> 04:30.880
like to schedule a follow-up
in a couple weeks.

04:30.882 --> 04:32.432
Sounds good.

04:32.434 --> 04:33.800
Hey, while you're here, uh,

04:33.802 --> 04:35.718
can I ask you
a little personal advice?

04:35.720 --> 04:38.471
You had my hands down my pants
on two separate occasions.

04:38.473 --> 04:41.274
If you were a woman, I'd be
meeting your parents now.

04:41.276 --> 04:43.059
Well, you've been dumped
a lot, right?

04:43.061 --> 04:44.143
No.

04:44.145 --> 04:46.112
I mean, what's "a lot"?
I...

04:46.114 --> 04:47.179
Yes, I have.

04:47.181 --> 04:49.499
How did you get over
your wife leaving you?

04:51.986 --> 04:53.736
You know the five stages
of grief?

04:53.738 --> 04:54.871
Sure.

04:54.873 --> 04:56.789
They left out
the three best ones--

04:56.791 --> 05:00.410
pot, one-night stands
and buying a beach house.

05:00.412 --> 05:02.862
I don't know,
I'm not sure that's me.

05:02.864 --> 05:05.031
You can't just sit around
feeling sorry for yourself.

05:05.033 --> 05:07.250
I'm getting so good at it.

05:07.252 --> 05:08.534
Well, it gets better.

05:08.536 --> 05:10.553
You just got to get out there
and meet somebody new.

05:10.555 --> 05:13.423
It's tough-- Judith and I were
together a long time.

05:13.425 --> 05:14.540
I get it.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.225
She was your world.

05:16.227 --> 05:17.810
But trust me.

05:17.812 --> 05:19.545
You will meet
someone else to spend

05:19.547 --> 05:20.713
the rest of your life with.

05:20.715 --> 05:22.398
In my case it was Alan.

05:23.984 --> 05:26.152
Yeah, I'm surrounded
by sick kids all day.

05:26.154 --> 05:27.186
Where am I gonna
meet someone?

05:27.188 --> 05:28.521
You just got
to keep your heart

05:28.523 --> 05:30.690
and your eyes open.

05:32.993 --> 05:34.727
Who are they?

05:34.729 --> 05:36.779
Oh, they're
pharmaceutical reps.

05:36.781 --> 05:38.831
They come by and give
away free drugs.

05:40.334 --> 05:44.287
Yeah, where are you
gonna meet someone?

05:47.958 --> 05:51.577
Okay, I got a good feeling
about this one.

05:55.299 --> 05:57.050
This is my house.

05:58.268 --> 06:00.603
Okay, Mr. Driver,
we're good.

06:00.605 --> 06:02.689
Bye-bye.

06:02.691 --> 06:05.191
Ladies, I must warn you

06:05.193 --> 06:07.393
that once you cross
this threshold

06:07.395 --> 06:09.445
you waive your
right to sobriety,

06:09.447 --> 06:11.280
chastity,

06:11.282 --> 06:13.700
dignity,

06:13.702 --> 06:15.601
and a couple other "ity-ties."

06:15.603 --> 06:17.570
Waived.
Yeah, me, too.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.041
Oh, wow.

06:22.043 --> 06:23.493
This is so cool.

06:23.495 --> 06:25.461
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

06:25.463 --> 06:27.964
Oh, it's happening.
Okay.

06:27.966 --> 06:29.298
What's the plan--
are we, uh,

06:29.300 --> 06:30.333
are we two twosomes?

06:30.335 --> 06:32.418
Or a foursome?

06:32.420 --> 06:33.786
Or do you want
to have a threesome

06:33.788 --> 06:34.754
with them while I watch?

06:34.756 --> 06:36.305
'Cause I'm fine with that.

06:36.307 --> 06:38.141
I'm not.

06:38.143 --> 06:41.344
Oh, okay, I'll just
take the tall one.

06:42.396 --> 06:44.397
Which one's the tall one?

06:45.399 --> 06:47.316
I got this.

06:47.318 --> 06:49.519
Okay, ladies.

06:49.521 --> 06:51.470
Alcohol is this way.

06:51.472 --> 06:54.190
We don't want anyone sobering up
and thinking things through.

06:55.242 --> 06:57.360
Hey, Alan!

06:57.362 --> 07:00.780
Hey, uh, uh,
who are your friends?

07:00.782 --> 07:02.865
Oh, this is Plaxitril

07:02.867 --> 07:04.316
and she sells Kristen.

07:04.318 --> 07:06.285
No, no, no, I'm Kristen.

07:06.287 --> 07:07.870
I sell Plaxitril.

07:07.872 --> 07:10.990
I'm pretty sure it's
the other way around.

07:10.992 --> 07:13.259
It's, uh,

07:13.261 --> 07:15.378
it's nice to meet you, Kristen.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.513
Oh, and this is Morgan.

07:17.515 --> 07:20.717
I sell boner pills
and baby laxatives.

07:22.136 --> 07:23.853
And I'm Herb.
Hi, Herb.

07:23.855 --> 07:25.555
Yes, I am.

07:25.557 --> 07:26.556
Okay.

07:26.558 --> 07:28.307
Salt, check, uh...

07:29.527 --> 07:31.844
Limes, check.

07:31.846 --> 07:33.863
Tequila, check.

07:33.865 --> 07:35.364
Two gorgeous ladies.

07:35.366 --> 07:36.983
Check.
Check.

07:36.985 --> 07:39.986
The doctor's ready
to administer some shots.

07:39.988 --> 07:42.155
Some body shots.

07:54.418 --> 07:55.501
Well...

07:55.503 --> 07:58.504
I guess I am
gonna masturbate tonight.

08:02.467 --> 08:05.535
Hey, did I tell you
that I was a gymnast?

08:05.537 --> 08:07.459
You're kidding.

08:07.460 --> 08:07.983
Nope.

08:07.984 --> 08:10.618
I was an alternate
for the Olympic team.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.337
I can totally put both

08:12.339 --> 08:15.407
of my legs behind
my head. Watch.

08:16.670 --> 08:20.642
U.S.A.!

08:21.492 --> 08:23.703
I can't do that, but I can put

08:23.704 --> 08:25.821
my entire fist in my mouth.

08:25.823 --> 08:28.324
Check it out.

08:28.326 --> 08:30.843
Beautiful and talented.

08:30.845 --> 08:33.078
Thank you.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.467
Yup, definitely masturbating.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.474
Hey, Alan!

08:45.476 --> 08:48.627
Hey, uh, you guys having fun?

08:48.629 --> 08:51.263
Yeah, I was just getting
more tequila.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.765
How are you?

08:52.767 --> 08:56.735
I'm good.
Just watching <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

08:56.737 --> 08:58.187
Big episode.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.773
Someone stole a spoon.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.693
Walden,
get the video camera!

09:04.695 --> 09:06.612
Aw, good idea.

09:06.614 --> 09:10.232
There's gonna be a video.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.788
Hey, Alan?

09:15.790 --> 09:17.206
Do you got any Crisco?

09:19.492 --> 09:20.843
Um...

09:20.845 --> 09:23.546
Uh, there's some olive oil
by the stove.

09:23.548 --> 09:25.798
That'll work.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.607
Have you seen my bra?

09:34.609 --> 09:36.859
Uh, uh, no.

09:36.861 --> 09:39.612
Your son hid it somewhere.

09:39.614 --> 09:41.230
I'm sorry, my son?

09:41.232 --> 09:43.699
Yeah, Walden.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.073
Hey, Alan.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.127
Have you seen Plaxitril?

10:02.085 --> 10:04.420
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

10:09.859 --> 10:10.993
Morning.

10:10.995 --> 10:13.562
Hey, what's that for?

10:13.564 --> 10:17.433
You can't carry a toilet bowl.

10:18.401 --> 10:20.319
Are you drunk or hungover?

10:20.321 --> 10:23.022
Yes.

10:23.024 --> 10:25.991
What happened last night?

10:25.993 --> 10:29.278
A lot of gray areas.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.230
There was tequila.

10:35.585 --> 10:39.004
A walk on the beach.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.572
And then
the coast guard escorted

10:40.574 --> 10:43.042
our boat back to shore.

10:43.044 --> 10:45.844
Wait, your boat?

10:45.846 --> 10:48.246
Well, not technically.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.466
I commandeered it.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.185
Apparently Plaxitril has

10:53.187 --> 10:55.771
a pirate side effect.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.174
Top of the morning to you.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.645
How are you in such a good mood?

11:02.647 --> 11:06.281
Three pills, two pukes
and a poo and I'm good to go.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.852
You know what? You were right.

11:09.854 --> 11:12.154
I can't sit around
feeling sorry for myself.

11:12.156 --> 11:14.123
Last night was a revelation
for me.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.158
I have never felt so alive.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.409
Which is ironic,
because I believe

11:17.411 --> 11:19.828
for a few minutes last night
I was legally dead.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.415
Now who wants a Bloody Mary?

11:24.968 --> 11:27.503
I'll have one.

11:27.505 --> 11:30.055
Don't judge me.
You stole a boat.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.458
Attaboy. How about you, Walden?

11:33.460 --> 11:36.311
I don't think I can have
any more alcohol.

11:36.313 --> 11:39.014
I don't think I can have
any more alcohol.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.101
Man up. I didn't fix those nuts

11:42.103 --> 11:44.153
so you could grow a vagina.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.107
All right, I'll have one.

11:48.109 --> 11:49.408
Attagirl.

came over.

I sent out
a couple tweets.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.816
I posted a couple
pictures on Instagram.

13:03.818 --> 13:05.818
Bing-bang-boom, here we are.

13:05.820 --> 13:09.021
I chat on AOL a lot.

13:10.774 --> 13:13.158
Okay, I think we need
to shut this down.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.661
Yeah, yeah, we're fried.

Are you a pharmaceutical
rep, too?

13:20.417 --> 13:22.317
No. I'm a junior
at Pepperdine.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.572
Pepperdine's
a good school.

13:48.302 --> 13:52.389
Wow. This looks like
Charlie Sheen's house.

Pepperdine is not a good school.

Why am I face down

14:11.048 --> 14:13.998
on the back of the sofa
in my underwear?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.769
Because I was kind enough
to put underwear on you.

14:21.307 --> 14:23.692
How did this happen?

14:25.194 --> 14:27.279
Herb.

14:27.281 --> 14:29.681
Oh, that guy's out of control.

14:29.683 --> 14:32.234
This house is a mess.

14:32.236 --> 14:34.903
Maybe I should I just cut
my losses and sell it.

14:34.905 --> 14:38.089
Don't even joke like that.

14:40.827 --> 14:42.777
Oh, Berta,

Yeah, the last few weeks
have been a blast.

16:02.442 --> 16:03.658
It's been two days.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.443
Oh, good Lord.

16:07.413 --> 16:09.981
I guess what we're saying
is maybe it's time

16:09.983 --> 16:11.633

Yeah. And I haven't thought
about her at all

16:21.628 --> 16:25.563
the last two days. Or weeks.
Whichever we agreed is real.

16:25.565 --> 16:27.232
And-and that's great,
but, you know, we just...

16:27.234 --> 16:30.969

Oh, hey.
I got new trash cans.

17:22.439 --> 17:24.856
They're wicker.

17:24.858 --> 17:26.574
What's the problem?

17:26.576 --> 17:28.410
You can't puke in wicker.

17:29.378 --> 17:32.030
It's like using a mesh condom.

17:32.865 --> 17:35.166
All the important stuff
gets through.

17:35.168 --> 17:38.219
Fine. I'll return them.
Of course, I'll need

17:38.221 --> 17:41.706
to hold onto your credit card
for a few more days.

17:43.642 --> 17:45.143
Of course you will.

Hey, you haven't talked
to Herb lately, have you?

17:47.764 --> 17:49.831
No. I texted him
a couple days ago,

17:49.833 --> 17:51.566
but he never responded.

17:51.568 --> 17:54.019
Hmm. I called him,
invited him over for dinner

17:54.021 --> 17:55.487
and I never heard back.

17:55.489 --> 17:56.721
Hmm.

17:56.723 --> 17:57.956
You think he's okay, right?

17:57.958 --> 17:59.274

17:59.276 --> 18:00.892
Exactly.

18:00.894 --> 18:02.560
I mean, you know,
other than the fact

18:02.562 --> 18:05.113
that his marriage
just fell apart.

18:05.115 --> 18:06.998
And the last time we saw him

18:07.000 --> 18:08.900
he was counteracting
pharmaceutical cocaine

18:08.902 --> 18:12.403
by snorting cat tranquilizers.

18:12.405 --> 18:15.740
And then we go kick him out.

18:15.742 --> 18:17.592
Oh, my God, we killed Herb.

you can track somebody

18:32.859 --> 18:34.759

18:34.761 --> 18:37.529
Yeah. I'd track you
if you ever used one.

doing here?

18:43.487 --> 18:45.603

just about to eat.

You're still partying with
the pharmaceutical reps?

18:54.381 --> 18:58.133
They bailed. These chicks came
with the room.

18:58.135 --> 19:00.802
Okay, Herb, it's time
for the party to end.
