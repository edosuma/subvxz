00:06.699 --> 00:09.538
I see all these girls coming on to
him. I think he might be gay.

00:09.539 --> 00:12.418
We have found a spacious,
rent-free hall.

00:12.419 --> 00:14.618
You mean you're moving
into the community centre?

00:14.619 --> 00:18.378
We're going to be flatmates.

00:18.379 --> 00:21.538
I'm your new probation worker.
You cross me

00:21.539 --> 00:23.178
and I will...

00:23.179 --> 00:25.458
fuck you like you have
never been fucked before.

00:25.549 --> 00:26.948
Who are you?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.959
I'm Lola.
I'm a trainee probation worker.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.919
You're a trainee probation worker?

00:31.920 --> 00:35.919
Is that going to be
a problem for you?

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:50.160 --> 00:54.159
Get your stuff. Time to go.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.719
Where to?

01:41.720 --> 01:45.719
Take me home.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.719
Looks like rain.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.519
Will you behave?

02:03.520 --> 02:06.119
Honestly it's shaping up to be
a beautiful day, this.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.119
It's full of wonder, and endless
possibility. Look at it.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.159
Are you sure you don't need it?

02:58.160 --> 03:02.159
No. Take it. It's yours.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.759
Look at you. All grown up.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.599
I remember
when you used to have nightmares.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.599
You used to get into bed -
my bed - and we'd snuggle up.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.839
You were all... snuggly.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.319
Was I?

03:19.320 --> 03:23.319
Look, just because me and your dad
aren't together any more...

03:23.480 --> 03:25.119
You know I'm still here for you,
right?

03:25.120 --> 03:27.559
Sure.

03:27.560 --> 03:31.559
Great. I think we're good to go.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.399
OK.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.119
So... that was fucking weird, eh?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.039
What?

03:48.040 --> 03:50.399
The thing with your step-mum
coming onto you.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.639
What? She wasn't!

03:52.640 --> 03:54.479
Mmm.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.319
That? That's just how she is.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.439
She's... she's very affectionate.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.679
When she wants to fuck someone.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.119
She used to have sex with me dad.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.519
You know, there are bounds,
whatever they are,

04:07.520 --> 04:09.359
and we - me and her...

04:09.360 --> 04:13.199
I'm out of them and so is she.
Just out of bounds.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.199
So if I'd have had sex with your
dad, you wouldn't sleep with me?

04:17.279 --> 04:18.879
Jesus.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.159
Now I've got an image of you
having sex with me dad.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.159
Uh-huh.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.759
Was it from behind?

04:27.760 --> 04:31.759
It is now!

04:34.200 --> 04:36.239
I fucked your mum.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.399
I didn't.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.399
So, new TV. Big moment. You could
come over later and watch a DVD.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.199
You live in the Community Centre.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.759
I'm not going all the way home
and coming back, again.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.719
You could not go home
and watch a DVD.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.719
All right. Just as long as you're
not one of those man-child wankers

04:58.080 --> 05:01.239
who's obsessed with Star Wars.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.279
It's Harry Potter with me.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.959
You know what really intrigued me
about the whole franchise?

05:05.960 --> 05:09.639
At what point does it become OK
to want to fuck Hermione?

05:09.640 --> 05:12.559
Me? I'm a Goblet Of Fire man.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.119
Yeah? Yeah.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.519
Eh, don't forget to sign on.
How do they expect us to survive

05:19.680 --> 05:21.679
on single benefits when there's
two of us?

05:21.680 --> 05:25.679
I'm not sure the benefit system was
designed for situations like ours.

05:25.880 --> 05:26.959
Go and see Mum and Dad.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.839
See if you can't guilt-trip them
into giving you some money.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.879
Steal if you have to.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.519
Dad usually keeps a couple of quid

05:33.520 --> 05:36.519
under that crappy polar bear
paperweight thing.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.159
Look, I'm not your slave.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.119
Go and get some crisps.
Cheese and onion.

05:42.120 --> 05:45.399
No, fuck it,
let's go exotic - prawn cocktail.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.319
Do you want to be Rudy One,
or do you want to be Rudy Two?

05:49.320 --> 05:53.319
I'll be Rudy Too -
spelled T, double O, because I am.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.519
I get it. Will you...
What's wrong with me toothbrush?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.199
You don't have a toothbrush.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.399
I'm sharing with Finn.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.479
Does he know that?

06:03.480 --> 06:04.879
Does he need to know that?

06:04.880 --> 06:08.599
Look, you take care of your teeth
and I'll take care of mine.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.319
You really are a petty,
selfish little man.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.319
There's no crisps for you.
Just fuck off.

06:17.320 --> 06:21.319
Yeah.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.599
Fuck it.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.759
"I'll be Rudy Too - T, double O,
because I am." You fucking...

06:46.880 --> 06:48.599
What, did you forget something?

06:48.600 --> 06:52.359
Is that a ukulele? What the bloody
hell are you doing with that?

06:52.360 --> 06:56.039
You know them things
remind me of him.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.879
Yeah, well, when you're locked
in a prison cell 23 hours a day,

06:59.880 --> 07:03.879
there's not much else to do than
masturbate and play ukulele.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.319
What? No hug?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.519
What are you doing here?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.079
I came to see you.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.679
I feel at least you owe me
an apology for getting me sent down.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.719
I don't know what you're
talking about, mate.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.719
You two sent me out to get us
some Curly Wurlys.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.279
The police just so happened to know
exactly where I'd be.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.519
You're a fucking psychopath.
You're a liability, mate.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.279
You nearly battered that guy
half to death.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.599
I taught him a valuable lesson.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.879
You bit his frigging ear off.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.119
He should've listened.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.879
What's the point in having ears
if you don't use them?
Yeah, what about his nose?

07:39.880 --> 07:43.159
His nose was just for the comedy.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.839
I've got a present for you.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.839
Have you?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.319
I believe this is yours.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.119
Ah, you're all right.
I've gone off them.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.439
They're... they're very sugary.
You know...

08:01.440 --> 08:05.439
Take it.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.079
Take it.
I don't want to.

08:07.080 --> 08:11.079
Take the fucking candy bar, take it!
Take it, take it.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.399
Fuck it.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.639
What do you say?

08:16.640 --> 08:18.439
Thank you.

08:18.440 --> 08:22.439
That wasn't so bad, was it?

08:28.240 --> 08:32.239
Please, please...

08:40.520 --> 08:44.519
Bye-bye.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.719
Oh, you handsome bastard.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.679
Hello.

09:47.520 --> 09:51.519
Was there something you wanted?

09:53.080 --> 09:56.759
I like watching other people work.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.199
You can take over if you like.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.879
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.919
Now scrub the fucking wall.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.559
Are you allowed to talk to us
like that?

10:06.560 --> 10:09.879
Are you going to report me?

10:09.880 --> 10:11.439
Scrub it.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.439
Fuck you.

10:15.760 --> 10:16.999
Is this some kind of power trip
to you?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.879
Now he's getting it.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.879
You know, maybe I came down here
last night

10:23.880 --> 10:26.439
and graffitied all over the walls

10:26.440 --> 10:30.279
just so I could watch you
scrub it off.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.239
Yeah. Right.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.239
Sure you did.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.639
You intrigue me.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.639
Just to restate the obvious,
me and you is never going to happen.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.319
From what I can see, it isn't
going to happen with anyone.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.559
When was the last time
you even got laid?

11:55.560 --> 11:57.519
Fuck off.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.359
Has it been a while?

11:59.360 --> 12:03.359
What are we talking, like,
a couple of months? Six?

12:03.920 --> 12:07.199
A year?

12:07.200 --> 12:08.439
How do you know it still works?

12:08.440 --> 12:12.439
One thing's for certain.
You'll never find out.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.159
What happened?

12:17.160 --> 12:21.159
Did someone hurt you?

12:22.880 --> 12:26.879
You don't know anything about me,
so don't act like you do.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.959
You act all tough and sassy.
That's an act.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.639
I see right through you.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.919
Take your hand off me.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.759
Or what?

12:37.760 --> 12:39.239
We're just talking.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.679
You stay the fuck away from me.

12:40.680 --> 12:44.679
I can't, I can't do that now.
I'm drawn to you.

12:46.560 --> 12:50.559
You're special.
I enjoyed our little chat.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.119
To be continued, yeah?

12:54.120 --> 12:55.967
You're acting again.

13:14.636 --> 13:18.135
We forgot the remote control
for the TV. There's no remote.

13:18.205 --> 13:20.324
And to a guy,
that's like losing a testicle.

13:20.325 --> 13:22.484
It's like losing three testicles.

13:22.485 --> 13:24.124
We need to go round to
Lisa's to get it.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.244
And by "we", I mean you need to
drive me round there.

13:26.245 --> 13:30.044
And there's no way you can just get
up and walk over to the TV
when you need to change channels?

13:30.045 --> 13:33.044
Is that a joke? This isn't the '70s.

13:33.045 --> 13:37.044
OK. Whatever.

13:48.805 --> 13:52.804
Are you OK?

13:53.045 --> 13:57.044
This whole thing with inviting me
over to watch a DVD.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.844
It's cos you want to
get in my knickers, right?

14:00.845 --> 14:02.964
Is that a trick question?

14:02.965 --> 14:04.524
I just want you to be
straight with me.

14:04.525 --> 14:06.164
It's not a deal breaker.

14:06.165 --> 14:09.484
It's not like I need to be fingering
a girl to enjoy a movie,

14:09.485 --> 14:10.764
you know far from it.

14:10.765 --> 14:13.884
I mean if we're going there,
I'll settle for a kiss,

14:13.885 --> 14:16.404
maybe a feel of your tits.

14:16.405 --> 14:19.324
Are we haggling?
I feel like I'm in a Moroccan souk.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.404
Go and get the remote control.

14:22.405 --> 14:26.404
Right.

14:32.645 --> 14:36.644
I forgot the remote control.

14:44.645 --> 14:45.764
Were you checking me out?

14:45.765 --> 14:49.764
What? No. Who? I, I was...

14:50.845 --> 14:52.564
The remote control. Thank God.

14:52.565 --> 14:54.524
It's like losing three testicles.

14:54.525 --> 14:58.484
Finn, relax. It's not like you
haven't seen my arse before.

14:58.485 --> 15:01.004
At least you think I've got
something worth looking at.

15:01.005 --> 15:05.004
I should probably go.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.284
What?

15:06.285 --> 15:10.284
When I was with your dad,
did you fancy me?

15:10.565 --> 15:14.204
No. Why would you? You're...
No.

15:14.205 --> 15:18.204
Well, I'm closer to your age
than I am your dad's.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.604
I know what teenage boys are like.

15:20.605 --> 15:24.604
Not this one. I'm like exams,
sport, girls me own age.

15:25.885 --> 15:29.884
I know you used to, um, masturbate
over those topless photos of me.

15:32.245 --> 15:34.124
You've got the wrong guy.

15:34.125 --> 15:38.124
Er, I found them
hidden under your mattress.

15:39.045 --> 15:40.844
You know I...

15:40.845 --> 15:44.844
probably
shouldn't say this but... I liked it.

15:48.445 --> 15:52.004
The thought of you...

15:52.005 --> 15:55.284
touching yourself
while you looked at me.

15:55.285 --> 15:56.764
Long time ago. It's all a blur.

15:56.765 --> 15:58.764
Can I please just get
the remote control?

15:58.765 --> 16:02.284
Sure.

16:02.285 --> 16:03.324
Thanks.

16:03.325 --> 16:05.804
I still think of you, looking at me.

16:05.805 --> 16:07.564
That's nice.

16:09.725 --> 16:11.684
Are you out of your fucking mind?

16:11.685 --> 16:14.644
I think about you and me.

16:14.645 --> 16:17.044
You shouldn't be doing that.

16:17.045 --> 16:18.284
Oh, yeah?
No.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.764
What the fuck!?

16:19.765 --> 16:23.044
No, no, no. Don't do, don't do that.

16:23.045 --> 16:25.924
No, no! Yes, yes...

16:44.405 --> 16:48.404
Shall we go to bed?

16:48.885 --> 16:52.884
I just need to use your bathroom.

17:04.125 --> 17:07.884
One remote control.
Mission accomplished.

17:07.885 --> 17:09.964
Let's go.
Are you OK?

17:09.964 --> 17:12.243
I'm good. Remote control in hand.

17:12.244 --> 17:15.684
Start the engine.

17:15.685 --> 17:19.684
You come in my mouth and then you
go running back to your girlfriend!

17:19.765 --> 17:22.644
Good one. She's hilarious.
Mental. Drive the car.

17:22.645 --> 17:25.324
Your boyfriend just
put his cock in my mouth.

17:25.325 --> 17:27.804
In her dreams.

17:29.045 --> 17:31.204
Jess. I'm sorry. It was an accident!

17:31.205 --> 17:34.964
These things happen!

17:34.965 --> 17:38.964
I'm such a mess.
I'm such a fucking mess.

17:46.205 --> 17:49.804
Probably best not to tell me dad
about any of this.

17:49.805 --> 17:51.124
I really don't see it
helping anyone.

17:51.125 --> 17:54.124
You're walking away?

17:54.125 --> 17:58.124
You're just like him,
you're just like your dad.

17:59.325 --> 18:01.044
He's definitely taller.

18:01.045 --> 18:02.724
I thought you liked me?

18:02.725 --> 18:06.124
I do.

18:06.125 --> 18:08.364
I like your hair.

18:08.365 --> 18:11.244
I just...

18:11.245 --> 18:15.244
I have to...
I've left a chicken in the oven.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.884
I went to go and see Mum and Dad.

18:50.885 --> 18:51.924
Mum's not very happy.

18:51.925 --> 18:55.484
She says she caught Dad
staring at some woman's tits
in the Happy Eater.

18:55.485 --> 18:59.484
Dad said he was admiring her blouse,
which seems very unlikely.

19:02.885 --> 19:06.764
I don't know why
he puts up wi' her shit.

19:06.765 --> 19:10.764
He should cave her skull in with
that crappy polar bear paperweight.

19:12.365 --> 19:13.924
What's up with you?

19:13.925 --> 19:15.764
It's more a question
of what's in me.

19:15.765 --> 19:19.764
Have you taken an E?

19:19.925 --> 19:21.764
You're high enough as it is.

19:21.765 --> 19:24.324
I'm, I'm sitting this one out,
thank you very much.

19:24.325 --> 19:28.324
Absolutely ridiculous
idea you stu...

19:30.885 --> 19:32.524
It's you.

19:32.525 --> 19:34.844
Nice to see me, to see me.

19:34.845 --> 19:37.204
What have you done wi' him?

19:37.205 --> 19:38.764
Where's Rudy one?

19:38.765 --> 19:41.404
He's in here. Ain't he?

19:41.405 --> 19:42.964
What d'you want?

19:42.965 --> 19:45.404
If you want to get psychological?

19:45.405 --> 19:49.404
I reckon Freud would probably say
I wanted to fuck me mum.

19:51.605 --> 19:55.204
I'd say, "Freud you haven't seen our
mum lately. Maybe Auntie Barbara."

19:55.205 --> 19:56.924
Auntie Barbara's dead.

19:56.925 --> 19:59.804
Well then, I guess
she's off the menu.

19:59.805 --> 20:03.804
We'll leave town.
We'll do whatever you want.

20:03.925 --> 20:05.204
Just please let him go.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.564
You think he's your friend?

20:07.565 --> 20:11.564
When I pitched up here this morning,
he had your toothbrush up his arse.

20:14.325 --> 20:15.764
It was a joke man!

20:15.765 --> 20:18.564
Get back in there, you.

20:18.565 --> 20:22.564
That's the last we'll hear from you.

20:22.845 --> 20:26.844
Bollocks.

20:34.965 --> 20:38.964
Fuck.

21:44.673 --> 21:46.352
So that was weird, right?

21:46.362 --> 21:49.361
The whole crazy thing with Lisa.
I can explain.

21:49.420 --> 21:51.219
You can explain how you fucked her?

21:51.220 --> 21:52.859
I didn't fuck her. Who's that?

21:52.860 --> 21:56.659
His stepmum.
He's a stepmother-fucker.

21:56.745 --> 21:58.104
Oh, man!

21:58.105 --> 22:01.004
One, she isn't me stepmum
and two, I didn't fuck her.

22:01.613 --> 22:02.932
She just sucked him off.

22:02.933 --> 22:04.032
You're a stepmother-sucker?

22:04.126 --> 22:05.445
One, I didn't suck anything.

22:05.446 --> 22:07.365
Two, she's a woman,
she hasn't got a penis.

22:07.366 --> 22:09.365
Oh, she's the stepmother-sucker.

22:09.366 --> 22:13.365
No! One, she isn't me stepmum. Two...

22:14.206 --> 22:15.685
Can we talk about something else?

22:15.686 --> 22:18.085
So she did suck you off?

22:18.086 --> 22:22.045
Only technically.
It was an accident.

22:22.046 --> 22:24.565
You tripped
and inserted your cock in her mouth?

22:24.566 --> 22:28.245
We're in the kitchen and suddenly
she starts going down on me.

22:28.246 --> 22:32.245
Before I could stop her, she gets me
out and rams it in her...

22:33.206 --> 22:35.205
and I was like, "Whoa!"
And then I was like...

22:35.206 --> 22:37.925
Coming in her mouth.

22:37.926 --> 22:40.765
Thank you. I think everyone got it.

22:40.766 --> 22:44.205
If you really wanted to stop her,
you could have grabbed a fork

22:44.206 --> 22:47.925
and then rammed it in her eye.

22:47.926 --> 22:49.085
Perhaps a little extreme?

22:49.086 --> 22:52.325
Why don't you just tell the truth?

22:52.326 --> 22:54.285
Oh, I'm sure you put up
a huge fight,

22:54.286 --> 22:57.485
but then you felt the tip
of your cock slide into her mouth

22:57.486 --> 23:01.485
and it were all warm, weren't it?
And wet and grabby.

23:01.726 --> 23:05.445
"I am getting my dick sucked!
I am fucking invincible!"

23:05.446 --> 23:09.125
You just had to spray your seed
down the back of her throat,

23:09.126 --> 23:10.765
you couldn't help yourself.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.125
Do you know why?

23:12.126 --> 23:16.125
Cos you're pathetic.

23:19.126 --> 23:23.125
You deserve better.

23:26.166 --> 23:30.165
Prick. Aren't you?

23:35.566 --> 23:37.965
Someone's got his period. Jess.

23:37.966 --> 23:41.965
You're full of shit.

23:43.246 --> 23:46.645
Stepmother-sucker. Sweet.

23:46.646 --> 23:50.645
She isn't my step...

23:52.246 --> 23:54.885
What are you doing?

23:54.886 --> 23:58.885
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

24:00.686 --> 24:04.165
Don't lie to me.

24:04.166 --> 24:08.165
Because if there's one thing I hate
more than paedophiles...

24:09.126 --> 24:13.125
it's liars.

24:14.686 --> 24:18.685
OK. I'll definitely remember that.

24:19.126 --> 24:23.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:24.886 --> 24:28.885
What's the magic word?

24:29.126 --> 24:30.485
Excuse me?

24:30.486 --> 24:34.445
Say the magic word.

24:34.446 --> 24:38.125
Excuse me.

24:38.126 --> 24:42.125
That's two words. Word. Singular.

24:42.686 --> 24:44.205
Try again.

24:44.206 --> 24:47.045
Please?

24:47.046 --> 24:50.765
Please? Please, what?

24:50.766 --> 24:54.765
I...I don't know.

24:55.686 --> 24:59.645
I don't know the magic word.

24:59.646 --> 25:03.645
Were we given a magic word?

25:06.806 --> 25:10.765
The magic word...

25:10.766 --> 25:14.365
is "potato".

25:14.366 --> 25:18.365
Potato.

25:35.246 --> 25:38.325
Hi.

25:38.326 --> 25:39.365
Drink?

25:39.366 --> 25:43.365
Vodka.

25:47.846 --> 25:51.845
Ice?

26:07.686 --> 26:09.085
You going to pay for that?

26:09.086 --> 26:13.085
Are you going to make me pay for it?

26:14.246 --> 26:16.605
You sure you're a trainee
probation worker?

26:16.606 --> 26:18.245
Because you don't act like one.

26:18.246 --> 26:22.245
Maybe I only want to be a probation
worker so I can meet bad boys.

26:24.926 --> 26:27.765
Is that right?

26:27.766 --> 26:31.245
Finn.

26:31.246 --> 26:32.485
What're you doing here?

26:32.486 --> 26:34.805
I wanted to talk to
you about yesterday.

26:34.806 --> 26:37.525
Right. OK. Always good to talk.

26:37.526 --> 26:40.565
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I-I know I came on quite strong.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.165
You probably think I'm insane.

26:42.166 --> 26:44.725
No. You're, you're kooky.
You're definitely kooky.

26:44.726 --> 26:47.965
I don't want you to think of me
as... as your stepmum.

26:47.966 --> 26:50.525
I don't, because you aren't.

26:50.526 --> 26:54.525
You and Dad never married.
Never married.

26:54.846 --> 26:58.725
Right. So there's... there's no
reason that we can't be together.

26:58.726 --> 27:02.725
Except there is. I'm dying.

27:03.286 --> 27:05.165
No, I'm obviously not dying.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.245
I could be.

27:07.246 --> 27:11.245
Finn, I know it's complicated.
I know you have feelings for me

27:12.286 --> 27:15.085
and the last thing that
I want to do is mess it up.

27:15.086 --> 27:19.085
We can... take things slowly.

27:19.166 --> 27:23.005
Slow is good. Slow is very good.

27:23.006 --> 27:25.725
Let's slow things right down,
to a crawl.

27:25.726 --> 27:28.725
Why don't you come round tonight?
We can talk...

27:28.726 --> 27:32.725
Tonight? Is... is that slow?
That seems pretty fast.

27:33.846 --> 27:37.845
Do you like me or not?

27:40.126 --> 27:44.125
Of course I like you. OK?

27:44.246 --> 27:45.365
I like your hair.

27:45.366 --> 27:49.365
So you'll come round tonight?

27:49.446 --> 27:52.565
I'll cook your favourite.

27:52.566 --> 27:56.565
Excellent.

28:06.606 --> 28:09.845
They've been there all night.

28:09.846 --> 28:11.205
I'll leave them to it, then.

28:11.206 --> 28:14.165
Well, do you want a drink?

28:14.166 --> 28:16.285
I was going to have one
before we close up.

28:16.286 --> 28:20.285
OK.

28:25.366 --> 28:27.125
What do you think she's thinking?

28:27.126 --> 28:28.285
I think she's thinking,

28:28.286 --> 28:31.205
"Why is Curtis drinking with
a trainee probation worker?"

28:31.206 --> 28:35.205
Maybe she thinks we're fucking.

28:37.246 --> 28:40.525
Would you like people to think that?

28:40.526 --> 28:41.605
I guess it depends.

28:41.606 --> 28:44.245
On what?

28:44.246 --> 28:48.245
Whether we are.

28:52.246 --> 28:54.645
Good night?

28:54.646 --> 28:58.045
It's work, you know.

28:58.046 --> 29:02.045
So, erm... where's that guy
I always see you with in here?

29:03.966 --> 29:06.725
Careful. That sounds like
you're interested in me

29:06.726 --> 29:10.045
and from what I hear,
you're not interested in girls.

29:10.046 --> 29:13.565
You think I'm gay?
Who told you that?

29:13.566 --> 29:14.605
Curtis.

29:14.606 --> 29:17.685
He said you're always knocking back
girls when they come on to you.

29:17.686 --> 29:18.965
And that makes me gay?

29:18.966 --> 29:20.085
I don't know. Does it?

29:20.086 --> 29:24.085
Having sex with men -
that makes you gay.

29:25.886 --> 29:29.885
So if you're not gay, how comes you
knock all these girls back?

29:30.406 --> 29:34.405
Well... if I was really smooth...

29:37.686 --> 29:39.925
then I would look you in the eye

29:39.926 --> 29:43.405
and I would say,

29:43.406 --> 29:47.405
"Because they're not you."

29:50.846 --> 29:54.685
I could see a girl going for that.
Not me.

29:54.686 --> 29:57.725
Other girls.

29:57.726 --> 30:01.725
I should close up.

30:02.166 --> 30:06.165
D'you want to come back to mine
for a drink?

30:06.966 --> 30:08.045
Forget I asked.

30:08.046 --> 30:12.045
No. It's just, erm...

30:14.486 --> 30:16.845
Sure.

30:16.846 --> 30:20.845
Be right back.

30:35.246 --> 30:37.725
My, er... My neighbour's
just called me.

30:37.726 --> 30:41.725
He said my flat's been broken into.
I have to go.

30:41.846 --> 30:44.765
If you didn't want to come back
to mine, why didn't you just say?

30:44.766 --> 30:46.445
You make up some bullshit story?

30:46.446 --> 30:48.005
It's not like that.
What is it, then?

30:48.006 --> 30:52.005
It's not you.

31:00.406 --> 31:04.405
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid prick!

31:04.486 --> 31:06.285
What are you doing?

31:06.286 --> 31:07.805
Following you.

31:07.806 --> 31:11.045
You know what? I'm really not
in the mood for your creepy shit!

31:11.046 --> 31:12.805
Bad night?

31:12.806 --> 31:16.805
Do you want to talk about it?

31:17.846 --> 31:21.845
What's your problem?
What do you want from me?

31:22.606 --> 31:25.805
Do you want to fuck me?
You know what?

31:25.806 --> 31:29.405
Get it out of your system. Go ahead!
Come on! Fuck me!

31:29.406 --> 31:33.405
Don't talk like that.
That isn't who you are.

31:36.646 --> 31:39.765
You're better than that.

31:39.766 --> 31:42.645
So now you don't want to
have sex with me?

31:42.646 --> 31:46.645
I want to give you something pure
and something honest.

31:48.206 --> 31:51.085
I see them cunts, lying to you.

31:51.086 --> 31:53.165
They don't know how special you are.

31:53.166 --> 31:57.165
They're not fit to lick
the shit off me own boots.

32:00.046 --> 32:02.925
Me? I'd find the dog that
did that shit

32:02.926 --> 32:06.925
and I'll wring its furry
little neck.

32:09.846 --> 32:12.085
That's quite a speech.

32:12.086 --> 32:16.085
Hmm, I'll never lie to you.

32:16.646 --> 32:20.645
See you tomorrow.

32:33.006 --> 32:36.405
Lisa. Hey! I'm really sorry
I couldn't come round last night.

32:36.406 --> 32:40.405
It's a funny story.
Don't do that.

32:40.726 --> 32:44.485
Lisa! Lisa! Listen, listen to me!
Do not tell me Dad!

32:44.486 --> 32:48.485
Lisa? Lisa?!

33:17.166 --> 33:21.165
Dad?

33:23.966 --> 33:27.965
Hi.

33:28.686 --> 33:31.045
I really need to do some exercise.

33:31.046 --> 33:32.725
I just thought I'd swing by.

33:32.726 --> 33:34.685
Why's that?

33:34.686 --> 33:38.685
You know, cos I wanted to let
you know I love you.

33:38.686 --> 33:42.685
I don't say it enough.
I love you, Dad.

33:42.926 --> 33:44.005
Lisa told me.

33:44.006 --> 33:47.925
She's lying. She's a fucking liar!

33:47.926 --> 33:49.805
Well, what did she tell you?

33:49.806 --> 33:51.005
She told me what happened.

33:51.006 --> 33:52.525
Oh, did she?

33:52.526 --> 33:56.205
She says she sucked your cock.

33:56.206 --> 33:59.245
What's she like?
What a crazy thing to say!

33:59.246 --> 34:01.445
Fuck!

34:01.446 --> 34:04.565
I tried to stop her.
She's on her knees,

34:04.566 --> 34:08.565
ramming my cock in her mouth like
a starving African at a food camp.

34:08.806 --> 34:10.284
It sounds worse than it is.

34:10.286 --> 34:12.205
You f...

34:12.206 --> 34:14.925
How could you do that?
Jesus, Finn!

34:14.926 --> 34:16.405
Dad, I'm sorry.

34:16.406 --> 34:18.405
It's fucking sick!
That's your stepmum.

34:18.406 --> 34:22.005
Is it? You two never married so...

34:22.005 --> 34:23.364
Oh, right!

34:23.366 --> 34:27.364
Dad, I am so sorry.

34:29.646 --> 34:33.645
Look, I'm not your dad.

34:33.766 --> 34:36.565
You think I'm fucking joking?
I'm not your dad.

34:36.565 --> 34:39.245
I took you on.

34:39.246 --> 34:41.804
And I raised you, even though
I knew you weren't mine.

34:41.806 --> 34:44.205
You f... You do this to me?

34:44.206 --> 34:48.205
Wh-wh-what are you talking
about? Of course you're me dad.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.645
You have to be. Look at us.

34:51.646 --> 34:54.245
Look how short we are!

34:54.246 --> 34:58.245
You're not mine, Finn.
You never were.

34:59.926 --> 35:02.231
So now you know, you can fuck off.

35:11.915 --> 35:15.914
I am going to tear each
and every one of you a new arsehole.

35:17.399 --> 35:19.998
You! You're down for two.

35:20.049 --> 35:22.168
Is there a problem?
Shut it, Snoop Dogg.

35:22.247 --> 35:23.246
Snoop Dogg?

35:23.247 --> 35:27.166
Which one of you little fuckers
stole the wedding cake?

35:27.167 --> 35:31.166
I think the bride ate it.
I saw her earlier.

35:33.127 --> 35:37.126
She is no stranger
to the dessert trolley.

35:43.207 --> 35:46.526
You're on three.

35:46.527 --> 35:50.526
Three arseholes.

35:53.447 --> 35:57.446
My office, one at a time.

35:58.087 --> 36:00.046
We'll start with you,
my little princess.

36:00.047 --> 36:01.566
Why me? I didn't take anything.

36:03.887 --> 36:07.006
"Why, Mama?"

36:07.007 --> 36:11.006
You all just made my list of people
to fuck up today.

36:11.087 --> 36:15.086
I guarantee you won't shit
right for a week.

36:18.967 --> 36:20.446
So who took the cake?

36:20.447 --> 36:23.566
Odds are it was a fat person.

36:23.567 --> 36:26.406
Cos they're weak,
and they're craven,

36:26.407 --> 36:30.406
and they fuckin' love cake.

36:33.727 --> 36:36.006
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

36:49.367 --> 36:51.846
Where's the probation worker?

36:51.847 --> 36:55.166
I hate to disappoint you...

36:55.167 --> 36:59.126
but the probation worker
won't be joining us.

36:59.127 --> 37:00.246
How come?

37:00.247 --> 37:04.246
Cos somebody's
locked him in the toilets.

37:05.407 --> 37:08.006
He's not a happy man.

37:08.007 --> 37:11.326
Have you thought about what
I said to you?

37:11.327 --> 37:15.326
What's happened to you?

37:15.847 --> 37:16.886
You changed.

37:16.887 --> 37:19.366
I tell you what. I'll show you mine,
if you show me yours.

37:19.367 --> 37:22.326
I'm talking secrets,
rather than genitals.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.166
Why should I tell you anything?

37:24.167 --> 37:28.166
What's the point in talking
if it's just more bullshit?

37:28.847 --> 37:31.766
OK.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.286
You first.

37:33.287 --> 37:35.686
You're different.
What's going on with you?

37:35.687 --> 37:37.006
There's three of me.

37:37.007 --> 37:39.606
There's the two you've met already,
and then there's me.

37:39.607 --> 37:41.406
I'm a whole different person.

37:50.847 --> 37:54.286
It's your go.

37:54.287 --> 37:58.286
Someone hurt you, didn't they?

37:58.727 --> 38:00.286
Who was he?

38:00.287 --> 38:03.006
I thought he was my best friend.

38:03.007 --> 38:04.886
Where are they, the other Rudys?

38:04.887 --> 38:08.886
What's the saying?
You, er, keep your friends close...

38:13.207 --> 38:14.606
and your enemies closer.

38:14.607 --> 38:15.806
They're your enemies?

38:21.367 --> 38:25.286
Now it's my turn.

38:25.287 --> 38:29.166
This bloke. What did he do?

38:29.167 --> 38:33.166
I used to have an eating disorder.

38:34.767 --> 38:38.766
I wasn't, I wasn't very happy.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.526
Danny was there for me.

38:40.527 --> 38:44.086
He was the only person
I could talk to.

38:44.087 --> 38:47.526
I told him stuff.

38:47.527 --> 38:49.326
Things I've never told anyone else.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.126
We started sleeping together.

38:52.127 --> 38:54.446
Just like that,
he stopped calling me.

38:54.447 --> 38:57.486
He moved on to some other
messed-up girl. He befriended her.

38:57.487 --> 39:01.486
And then he fucked her.

39:05.007 --> 39:09.006
I took some pills and washed them
down with a bottle of vodka.

39:10.087 --> 39:14.086
I guess I wanted to die.

39:15.007 --> 39:17.006
Everything he has ever said to me
was a lie.

39:24.167 --> 39:25.286
Where were you before?

39:25.287 --> 39:27.886
I was in prison.

39:27.887 --> 39:31.886
The two other Rudys betrayed me,
set me up.

39:35.207 --> 39:39.206
Betrayed by the two people
I was closest to.

39:40.087 --> 39:44.086
Have you been with anyone else
since him?

39:44.487 --> 39:48.486
I haven't even kissed a guy
in over three years.

39:51.167 --> 39:54.086
Why were you in prison?

39:54.087 --> 39:55.486
I enjoy hurting people.

41:34.407 --> 41:38.406
What do you want from me?

41:38.727 --> 41:41.566
All my life, I've wanted to know
what it would feel like

41:41.567 --> 41:44.486
to kill someone.

41:44.487 --> 41:48.486
From the moment I saw you,
I knew you were the one.

41:49.847 --> 41:52.126
I want to know what it feels like,

41:52.127 --> 41:54.846
to slowly squeeze the life
out of your body.

41:54.847 --> 41:58.566
I want to feel you go limp
in my hands.

41:58.567 --> 42:02.566
I want to share this with you.

42:03.087 --> 42:06.326
Don't struggle. Ssshhh.

42:06.327 --> 42:10.326
You're so beautiful.

42:28.887 --> 42:30.446
You lied to me.

42:30.447 --> 42:32.726
Let the other Rudys go.

42:32.727 --> 42:34.686
It's over. Let them go.

42:34.687 --> 42:35.686
Kiss me.

42:35.687 --> 42:36.846
Let them go.

42:36.847 --> 42:40.566
Kiss me.

42:59.527 --> 43:02.966
That wasn't so bad, was it?

43:02.967 --> 43:05.286
You get out there now.

43:05.287 --> 43:09.286
Get yourself some cock.

43:09.807 --> 43:11.166
Promise me.

43:11.167 --> 43:12.366
I promise.

43:12.367 --> 43:15.086
Yeah.

43:15.087 --> 43:19.086
Let them go. Please. For me.

43:28.727 --> 43:32.246
What does it feel like?

43:32.247 --> 43:34.766
To kill someone?

43:34.767 --> 43:35.926
It's horrible.

43:35.927 --> 43:39.926
Seriously?

43:40.767 --> 43:44.766
Where's the fun in that?

43:58.767 --> 44:02.766
I'll get the shovels.

44:18.487 --> 44:19.846
Your dad isn't your dad?

44:19.847 --> 44:23.326
So wait, who is your dad?

44:23.327 --> 44:25.326
Turns out me mum
was a bit of a slut.

44:25.327 --> 44:26.526
No.

44:26.527 --> 44:27.926
Quite a lot of a slut.

44:27.927 --> 44:31.926
A huge, gigantic... Oh,
I'm trying not to think about it.

44:33.367 --> 44:37.086
No, it just could be anyone.
Could be me, could be him.

44:37.087 --> 44:39.326
Except you would have needed
to travel back in time.

44:39.327 --> 44:42.566
It was him.
He had the power to rewind time.

44:42.567 --> 44:45.246
I didn't travel through time
to fuck his mum.

44:45.247 --> 44:47.846
Yeah, well, I'm gonna side with him,
because of the whole...

44:47.847 --> 44:51.846
skin tone thing.
So, going over here.

44:57.927 --> 45:01.086
I'm sorry.

45:01.087 --> 45:05.086
The whole Lisa thing.
I'm a fucking idiot.

45:06.847 --> 45:09.606
Are we...

45:09.607 --> 45:12.486
Are we OK?

45:12.487 --> 45:15.886
You are a fucking idiot
and a total prick...

45:15.887 --> 45:19.886
just a really big, purple bell-end.

45:23.007 --> 45:25.846
We're fine.

45:25.847 --> 45:27.766
So if you're not doing
anything later,

45:27.767 --> 45:31.766
d'you want to not go home
and watch a DVD with me?

45:33.767 --> 45:37.766
Some other time. Stabbing someone
to death with a pair of scissors.

45:39.327 --> 45:43.326
Not really a popcorn moment.

45:56.967 --> 46:00.966
I got you a present.

46:08.407 --> 46:12.406
So you are a bad boy after all.

46:18.847 --> 46:22.846
That is fucking nice cake.

46:28.487 --> 46:31.246
What needs to be done...
needs to be done.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.366
You're going to bring him
back to life, aren't you?

46:33.367 --> 46:34.526
You used me.

46:34.527 --> 46:36.566
He says he's going to kill me.

46:36.567 --> 46:38.006
I think Curtis is in trouble.

46:38.007 --> 46:39.966
I'm not going to let that happen.

46:39.967 --> 46:41.646
He attacked me.

46:41.647 --> 46:43.686
Have you got any jelly?

46:43.687 --> 46:44.926
What do you need jelly for?

46:44.927 --> 46:47.526
I would've thought that was pretty
friggin' obvious. Check that out.

46:47.527 --> 46:49.726
Where are you,
you little shit? Come on!

46:49.727 --> 46:52.006
Some things were just not
meant to be.

46:52.007 --> 46:54.326
Are you sure we can't...

46:54.327 --> 46:58.326
manufacture some sort of
a happy ending?

46:58.351 --> 47:22.155
