<b>- This guy's just throwing salt</b>
<b>like it's a... it's French fries.</b>

00:35.769 --> 00:37.037
<b>- I think it looks great.</b>

00:37.137 --> 00:40.974

01:06.900 --> 01:08.235
<b>Can't believe he did that to me.</b>

01:11.338 --> 01:12.272
<b>I think it was a smart pick.</b>

01:12.372 --> 01:14.308
<b>- I know I did</b>
<b>a good, solid tattoo.</b>

01:14.408 --> 01:16.276

08:14.661 --> 08:16.663

<b>- Detective Gardner, after your</b>

09:03.243 --> 09:06.747
<b>- This print does have a lot</b>
<b>of detail that is in agreement,</b>

<b>but there is a bifurcation here.</b>

09:09.883 --> 09:11.351
<b>If you were to follow</b>

09:11.451 --> 09:12.753
<b>it meets what we call the delta.</b>

09:12.853 --> 09:16.623
<b>On this print, it's actually</b>
<b>supposed to be inside.</b>

09:16.723 --> 09:18.025
<b> <i>Because he did this,</i> </b>

09:18.091 --> 09:20.894
<b> <i>all the points are</i> </b>
<b> <i>shifted by one ridge.</i> </b>

09:21.028 --> 09:22.896
<b>We could call it an exclusion.</b>

09:23.030 --> 09:25.866
<b>- We do have a discrepancy here,</b>
<b>and we are off by one line,</b>

09:26.033 --> 09:28.802
<b> <i>and that one line is the exact</i> </b>
<b> <i>thing that, basically,</i> </b>

09:28.902 --> 09:31.138
<b>identifies that person</b>
<b>in that mark.</b>

09:31.238 --> 09:34.041
<b>- In terms of detail,</b>
<b>a little bit short.</b>

09:34.141 --> 09:35.542
<b>St. Marq.</b>

09:35.642 --> 09:38.145
<b>How does it feel to have your</b>
<b>fingerprint immortally placed</b>

09:38.245 --> 09:39.146
<b>on your son forever?</b>

09:39.246 --> 09:40.581
<b>- I feel very honored.</b>

09:40.681 --> 09:43.884
<b> <i>- Looking at it very close,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the detail seems very exact.</i> </b>

09:44.051 --> 09:46.253
<b>This is probably about</b>
<b>the exact size, I guessed,</b>

09:46.353 --> 09:47.487
<b>that it would need to be.</b>

09:47.588 --> 09:48.655
<b>- I wondered if a little smaller</b>
<b>would be possible,</b>

09:48.755 --> 09:50.958
<b>but after we got into it,</b>
<b>you were exactly...</b>

09:51.058 --> 09:52.860
<b>- It's a lot of details.</b>
<b>- It really is.</b>

09:52.960 --> 09:54.828
<b>- Detective Gardner,</b>
<b>in terms of detail,</b>

09:54.928 --> 09:57.097
<b>would this be a 100% match?</b>

09:59.233 --> 10:00.868
<b>-</b><b> <i>There is enough detail</i> </b>

10:00.968 --> 10:03.504
<b> <i>in agreement to make</i> </b>
<b> <i>an identification.</i> </b>

10:03.604 --> 10:05.639
<b>I would call it a match.</b>

10:05.739 --> 10:06.874
<b>- Christian.</b>

10:06.974 --> 10:08.976
<b>Obviously, you went with a</b>
<b>sacred heart design.</b>

10:09.076 --> 10:11.278
<b> <i>- I knew that I didn't have</i> </b>
<b> <i>the level of accuracy that</i> </b>

10:11.378 --> 10:13.313
<b>some of the other prints had,</b>
<b>so I started thinking,</b>

10:13.413 --> 10:15.816
<b>you know what, "I'm gonna</b>
<b>give Mike a badass tattoo."</b>

10:15.916 --> 10:18.585
<b> <i>- Just looking at the known</i> </b>
<b> <i>print, you can see this one</i> </b>

10:18.685 --> 10:20.287
<b> <i>is a little bit</i> </b>
<b> <i>more challenging.</i> </b>

10:20.387 --> 10:23.557
<b>- As people age,</b>
<b>the ridges lose elasticity,</b>

10:23.657 --> 10:25.158
<b> <i>and that was the case here.</i> </b>

10:25.259 --> 10:26.793
<b> <i>Doing a side-by-side</i> </b> <b> <i>comparison,</i> </b>

10:26.894 --> 10:29.096
<b> <i>there's not enough detail.</i> </b>

10:29.196 --> 10:32.733
<b>I wouldn't say this isn't hers,</b>
<b>but I wouldn't say it's a match.</b>

10:32.833 --> 10:34.601
<b>- Inconclusive.</b>
<b>- Inconclusive.</b>

10:34.701 --> 10:36.061
<b> <i>- This is not a creative</i> </b>
<b> <i>challenge.</i> </b>

10:36.103 --> 10:37.504
<b> <i>You [bleep] up the fingerprint.</i> </b>

10:37.604 --> 10:39.740
<b>You can't hide it by putting a</b>
<b>heart with flames in there.</b>

10:39.840 --> 10:41.108
<b>That's not what</b>
<b>this challenge is about.</b>

10:41.208 --> 10:43.010
<b>- Sausage.</b>

10:43.110 --> 10:44.470
<b>- It didn't have</b>
<b>any discrepancies.</b>

10:44.511 --> 10:45.546
<b> <i>It's definitely a match.</i> </b>

10:45.646 --> 10:47.648
<b> <i>- You did this thing</i> </b>
<b> <i>meticulously.</i> </b>

10:47.748 --> 10:48.949
<b> <i>You really hit the details</i> </b>
<b> <i>spot-on.</i> </b>

10:49.049 --> 10:52.386
<b> <i>And it was a nice, clean,</i> </b>
<b> <i>good, professional job.</i> </b>

10:52.486 --> 10:53.954
<b>- Cleen.</b>

10:54.054 --> 10:56.757
<b>- It looks very clean; There's</b>
<b>a lot of very small details.</b>

10:56.857 --> 10:58.959
<b>There's actually</b>
<b>the texture of the waves...</b>

10:59.059 --> 11:01.562
<b> <i>gives it a real, authentic</i> </b>
<b> <i>fingerprint look.</i> </b>

11:01.662 --> 11:04.831
<b>- Detective Gardner,</b>
<b>your analysis concluded?</b>

11:04.932 --> 11:06.567
<b> <i>- This print was definitely</i> </b>
<b> <i>a match.</i> </b>

11:06.667 --> 11:10.337
<b> <i>He got all the points</i> </b> <b> <i>dead-on.</i> </b>

11:10.437 --> 11:11.437
<b>- Anthony.</b>

11:11.471 --> 11:13.106
<b> <i>- Every ridge was</i> </b>
<b> <i>right on point.</i> </b>

11:13.207 --> 11:15.843
<b>This print was</b>
<b>definitely a match.</b>

11:15.943 --> 11:17.503
<b>- Definitely looks like</b>
<b>a strong tattoo.</b>

11:17.578 --> 11:18.712
<b> <i>It looks very crisp,</i> </b>

11:18.812 --> 11:19.947
<b> <i>especially for the smaller size</i> </b>
<b> <i>you went with.</i> </b>

11:20.080 --> 11:22.349
<b>- It seems like you had</b>
<b>a little time to spare,</b>

11:22.449 --> 11:24.384
<b> <i>so you went ahead and gave</i> </b>
<b> <i>this man a present,</i> </b>

11:24.484 --> 11:25.686
<b> <i>aside from the fingerprint.</i> </b>

11:25.786 --> 11:28.088
<b>Great craftsmanship</b>
<b>and a real keen eye.</b>

11:28.155 --> 11:31.091
<b>- As much as I want to talk bad</b>
<b>about Anthony, I freaking can't.</b>

11:31.158 --> 11:33.794
<b> <i>He makes me nervous</i> </b>
<b> <i>in this competition because</i> </b>

11:33.894 --> 11:34.795
<b> <i>he has not been tattooing</i> </b>
<b> <i>very long,</i> </b>

11:34.895 --> 11:38.098
<b>and he is swinging</b>
<b>for the fences.</b>

11:38.131 --> 11:40.167
<b> <i>This kid has come to play.</i> </b>

11:40.267 --> 11:41.101
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

11:41.134 --> 11:43.103
<b>- All the points in this print</b>

11:43.170 --> 11:45.272
<b>were 100% in sequence</b>
<b>with each other.</b>

11:45.372 --> 11:47.474
<b>No discrepancies at all.</b>

11:47.574 --> 11:49.814
<b>- Just using clean lines instead</b>
<b>of showing the textures:</b>

11:49.843 --> 11:51.011
<b>Smart move.</b>

11:51.111 --> 11:52.679
<b> <i>- It makes for an interesting</i> </b>
<b> <i>art piece,</i> </b>

11:52.779 --> 11:55.115
<b>and the</b>
<b>legibility on this is great.</b>

11:55.215 --> 11:55.916
<b>- Picasso.</b>

11:56.016 --> 11:58.118
<b>- It is a lot of line work</b>

11:58.218 --> 12:00.687
<b>very close together that,</b>
<b>down the road, would be</b>

12:00.787 --> 12:03.557
<b>more likely for some of the</b>
<b>lines to start to butt together</b>

12:03.657 --> 12:04.691
<b>and to darken up.</b>

12:04.791 --> 12:07.194
<b>- There was a little bit</b>
<b>of a discrepancy.</b>

12:07.294 --> 12:10.531
<b>There's a big void here,</b>
<b>but, in the known print,</b>

12:10.631 --> 12:13.734
<b>there's actually</b>
<b>a little island.</b>

12:13.834 --> 12:17.738
<b>Also, here we have a ridge that</b>
<b>was supposed to continue to go,</b>

12:17.838 --> 12:18.705
<b>and he ended it.</b>

12:18.805 --> 12:20.841
<b> <i>- Damn it!</i> </b> <b> <i>I'm disappointed.</i> </b>

12:20.941 --> 12:23.076
<b>I really wanted to be</b>
<b>on top this time.</b>

12:23.110 --> 12:25.779
<b>If this next challenge doesn't</b>
<b>play to my strength,</b>

12:25.879 --> 12:27.214
<b> <i>I could be [bleep].</i> </b>

12:28.916 --> 12:30.083
<b>- Tables are about to turn.</b>

12:30.184 --> 12:31.952
<b>- In this house,</b>
<b>you're either prey</b>

12:32.085 --> 12:33.554
<b>or you're a [bleep] predator.</b>

12:33.654 --> 12:34.855
<b>- You better do a good job.</b>

12:34.955 --> 12:36.190
<b> <i>This is do or die.</i> </b>

12:36.290 --> 12:37.391
<b> <i>Don't care who leaves</i> </b>
<b> <i>or how they leave,</i> </b>

12:37.491 --> 12:38.625
<b>just as long as they leave.</b>

12:38.725 --> 12:39.725
<b>- Stressful.</b>

12:47.141 --> 12:50.344
<b>- Today we're testing detail</b>
<b>with fingerprint tattoos.</b>

12:50.444 --> 12:52.580
<b>- So many people really</b>
<b>rose to the challenge</b>

12:52.680 --> 12:54.248
<b>and did some immensely</b>
<b>detailed tattoos.</b>

12:54.348 --> 12:57.518
<b>- What I like about Cleen's</b>
<b>tattoo is that he was able to</b>

12:57.618 --> 13:00.721
<b> <i>pull out textures in the actual</i> </b>
<b> <i>fingerprint, and he did it</i> </b>

13:00.821 --> 13:02.323
<b>in a technical way where that</b>
<b>tattoo will hold up</b>

13:02.423 --> 13:04.525
<b>and stand the test of time.</b>

13:04.625 --> 13:06.327
<b>It won't turn into a black blob.</b>

13:06.427 --> 13:08.729
<b>- Anthony's was definitely one</b>
<b>of my favorites of the day.</b>

13:08.829 --> 13:10.798
<b> <i>The lettering he put in there</i> </b>
<b> <i>was super slick.</i> </b>

13:10.898 --> 13:11.632
<b> <i>And he did some</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the best detail</i> </b>

13:11.732 --> 13:13.701
<b>at some of the smallest size.</b>

13:13.801 --> 13:17.037
<b>-</b><b> <i>Megan Jean, I liked the fact</i> </b>
<b> <i>that on her client she decided</i> </b>

13:17.138 --> 13:19.673
<b> <i>to go really bold and open</i> </b>
<b> <i>and airy; It's smart.</i> </b>

13:19.774 --> 13:22.143
<b>That tattoo, also,</b>
<b>I feel is gonna hold up.</b>

13:22.243 --> 13:24.745
<b>- We have several</b>
<b>very accurate matches.</b>

13:24.845 --> 13:26.881
<b>The one who did the most</b>
<b>aesthetically pleasing</b>

13:26.981 --> 13:30.351
<b>tattoo out of the accurate</b>
<b>matches should get the nod.</b>

13:30.451 --> 13:31.352
<b>Want to let them know?</b>

13:31.452 --> 13:34.021
<b>- Yep.</b>
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

13:34.121 --> 13:38.225
<b>Today you're being tested on</b>
<b>detail with fingerprint tattoos.</b>

13:38.325 --> 13:40.027
<b>The judges have decided.</b>

13:40.127 --> 13:41.929
<b>The winner of</b>
<b>the flash challenge...</b>

13:44.598 --> 13:45.499
<b>Is Cleen Rock One.</b>

13:45.599 --> 13:47.468
<b>all: Whoa.</b>

13:47.568 --> 13:50.004
<b>- The way you showed the texture</b>
<b>in the finger but still have</b>

13:50.104 --> 13:53.040
<b>the legibility and breathability</b>
<b>gives you the nod.</b>

13:53.140 --> 13:56.877
<b>- Cleen, you'll have the power</b>
<b>to assign all human canvases</b>

13:56.977 --> 13:59.580
<b>for the elimination tattoo</b>
<b>on your own.</b>

13:59.680 --> 14:00.381
<b>- This is the first time</b>
<b>a veteran artist</b>

14:00.481 --> 14:02.316
<b> <i>got the skull pick.</i> </b>

14:02.383 --> 14:04.418
<b>And you know what,</b>
<b>I came back for revenge.</b>

14:04.518 --> 14:05.486
<b> <i>These new guys, they need</i> </b>
<b> <i>to get out of here.</i> </b>

14:05.586 --> 14:07.421
<b> <i>And I'm gonna make it happen.</i> </b>

14:07.521 --> 14:08.789
<b>- Head back to the loft</b>
<b>and prepare to find out</b>

14:08.889 --> 14:13.627
<b>which veteran artist</b>
<b>you must face next.</b>

14:13.727 --> 14:14.895
<b>- Yeah.</b>

14:17.331 --> 14:19.033
<b>- The veterans think</b>
<b>they've already won</b>

14:19.133 --> 14:20.868
<b>and that we're gonna</b>
<b>take ourselves out.</b>

14:20.968 --> 14:22.803
<b>- I think the tables</b>
<b>are about to turn.</b>

14:22.903 --> 14:24.472
<b>I haven't really done</b>
<b>the best tattoos</b>

14:24.572 --> 14:26.073
<b>I could possibly do here,</b>

14:26.173 --> 14:28.075
<b>and you haven't either.</b>

14:28.175 --> 14:31.612
<b>Does that put us at</b>
<b>an advantage?</b>

14:31.712 --> 14:33.614
<b>- They're not really</b>
<b>gonna focus on us.</b>

14:33.714 --> 14:35.483
<b>They're gonna focus</b>
<b>on the bigger dogs,</b>

14:35.583 --> 14:37.351
<b>but they're gonna look around</b>

14:37.418 --> 14:39.153
<b>and all of a sudden go,</b>
<b>"Where'd you come from?"</b>

14:39.253 --> 14:40.921
<b>- They're gonna</b>
<b>wonder why they're...</b>

14:41.021 --> 14:42.189
<b>- Yeah, I'm not worried anymore.</b>

14:42.289 --> 14:44.158
<b>- I think they're</b>
<b>definitely going to give</b>

14:44.291 --> 14:45.893
<b>the harder skull picks</b>
<b>to the people that</b>

14:45.993 --> 14:46.961
<b>have been winning</b>
<b>these challenges.</b>

14:47.061 --> 14:49.196
<b>- I think they're gonna</b>
<b>go after Anthony.</b>

14:49.296 --> 14:51.198
<b>- He's kind of</b>
<b>sliding under the radar.</b>

14:51.298 --> 14:53.534
<b>- Yeah, he's smooth,</b>
<b>smooth brother.</b>

14:53.634 --> 14:56.670
<b>I've noticed that in this house,</b>
<b>you're either prey</b>

14:56.771 --> 14:58.572
<b>or you're a [bleep] predator.</b>

14:58.672 --> 15:01.442
<b>From this point on,</b>
<b>I'm a predator.</b>

15:04.712 --> 15:06.847
<b> <i>[industrial rock music]</i> </b>

15:12.319 --> 15:15.923
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

15:16.023 --> 15:18.426
<b>- Welcome to the next</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

15:18.526 --> 15:21.896
<b>Another "Ink Master" veteran</b>
<b>is back for revenge.</b>

15:21.996 --> 15:24.565
<b>To make it to the end,</b>
<b>you must defeat him.</b>

15:24.665 --> 15:25.666
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

15:25.766 --> 15:27.501
<b>- Our next veteran</b>
<b>was a dark horse</b>

15:27.601 --> 15:30.905
<b>whose consistency and fine</b>
<b>detail earned him a spot</b>

15:31.005 --> 15:32.139
<b>in the finale.</b>

15:34.475 --> 15:36.510
<b>- Who's that?</b>

15:40.414 --> 15:42.049
<b>- Matti Hixson.</b>

15:44.919 --> 15:45.986
<b>- Oh.</b>

15:46.087 --> 15:47.955
<b>- Suspender game on point.</b>

15:48.055 --> 15:50.791
<b>- I thought I smelled sausage.</b>

15:50.891 --> 15:52.326
<b>- The votes are tallied.</b>

15:52.426 --> 15:56.063
<b>The artist who you think</b>
<b>deserves to be in the final two</b>

15:56.163 --> 16:00.668
<b>and one step closer to the title</b>
<b>of Ink Master is Sausage.</b>

16:00.768 --> 16:02.002
<b>[cheers and applause]</b>

16:02.103 --> 16:06.607
<b>Matti, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

16:06.707 --> 16:08.943
<b>- Matti Hixson feels that</b>
<b>he should have been up there</b>

16:09.043 --> 16:11.312
<b>neck and neck with Scott,</b>
<b>but America had my back.</b>

16:11.412 --> 16:13.547
<b>I beat him once.</b>
<b>Now I'll beat him again.</b>

16:13.647 --> 16:15.816
<b> <i>- That slippery little wiener</i> </b>
<b> <i>made it back.</i> </b>

16:15.916 --> 16:17.118
<b>I'm coming back,</b>
<b>and I'm ready to</b>

16:17.218 --> 16:18.819
<b>compete with these assholes</b>
<b>and win it.</b>

16:18.919 --> 16:19.920
<b>There's no way I'm going</b>

16:20.020 --> 16:21.889
<b>back home without</b>
<b>the title of Ink Master.</b>

16:21.989 --> 16:24.091
<b>- Every detail in the actual</b>
<b>choice of the way</b>

16:24.191 --> 16:27.561
<b>that the design was put together</b>
<b>has a great look to it.</b>

16:27.661 --> 16:28.963
<b>It's just very dynamic.</b>

16:29.063 --> 16:30.598
<b>You just livened it up</b>
<b>with really bright colors</b>

16:30.698 --> 16:32.233
<b>that make this thing vibrant.</b>

16:32.333 --> 16:34.068
<b>- Thank you.</b>

16:34.168 --> 16:35.536
<b>- Hey, I know this guy.</b>

16:35.636 --> 16:37.671
<b>Matti: He's one of those guys</b>
<b>who wants to fly under the radar</b>

16:37.772 --> 16:39.473
<b>and then stick you in the back</b>
<b>when you're not looking.</b>

16:39.573 --> 16:41.675
<b>Definitely somebody to keep your</b>
<b>eyes open with.</b>

16:41.776 --> 16:44.278
<b>- As a veteran, you fought</b>
<b>through this competition once,</b>

16:44.345 --> 16:47.448
<b>so now you are</b>
<b>calling the shots.</b>

16:47.548 --> 16:51.285
<b>Matti, what is the next</b>
<b>elimination tattoo?</b>

16:51.385 --> 16:52.153
<b>- Bring it.</b>

16:52.286 --> 16:53.687
<b>- We're gonna do Venetian masks.</b>

16:53.788 --> 16:55.856
<b>- I don't even know</b>
<b>what that is.</b>

16:55.956 --> 16:57.558
<b>- Why Venetian masks?</b>

16:57.658 --> 16:58.993
<b>- Venetian masks have</b>
<b>a lot of detail...</b>

16:59.093 --> 17:00.528
<b>- For sure.</b>

17:00.628 --> 17:02.830
<b>- So it's something that's</b>
<b>really gonna test everybody.</b>

17:02.930 --> 17:03.764
<b>- Bad choice.</b>

17:03.864 --> 17:06.800
<b>- Matti, go ahead</b>
<b>and take a seat.</b>

17:06.901 --> 17:08.135
<b>You heard Matti.</b>

17:08.301 --> 17:11.672
<b>Today you must show detail</b>
<b>by tattooing Venetian masks.</b>

17:11.771 --> 17:13.707
<b> <i>Wearing masks</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a centuries-old tradition</i> </b>

17:13.808 --> 17:14.608
<b> <i>in Venice, Italy.</i> </b>

17:14.708 --> 17:17.211
<b> <i>It started during Carnevale,</i> </b>

17:17.310 --> 17:19.547
<b>when people would</b>
<b>eat, drink, and party.</b>

17:19.646 --> 17:22.049
<b> <i>They wore masks to hide</i> </b>
<b> <i>their identities so that</i> </b>

17:22.148 --> 17:24.718
<b> <i>they could be whatever</i> </b>
<b> <i>and be whoever they wanted</i> </b>

17:24.819 --> 17:25.920
<b>without anybody knowing.</b>

17:26.020 --> 17:29.890
<b>Remember, you are being judged</b>
<b>on detail.</b>

17:29.990 --> 17:31.525
<b>Let's meet your canvases.</b>

17:36.831 --> 17:38.332
<b>Cleen, you won</b>
<b>the flash challenge.</b>

17:38.432 --> 17:42.369
<b>You now have the power</b>
<b>to assign the human canvases.</b>

17:42.470 --> 17:45.072
<b>And this competition</b>
<b>is always changing,</b>

17:45.172 --> 17:48.075
<b>so seize this opportunity</b>
<b>for control.</b>

17:48.175 --> 17:49.375
<b>- Got to take control of this.</b>

17:49.410 --> 17:50.711
<b> <i>I'm gunning for the newbies.</i> </b>

17:50.811 --> 17:53.013
<b>They've been trying to screw me</b>
<b>over since I got here.</b>

17:53.114 --> 17:54.148
<b> <i>Now it's payback.</i> </b>

17:54.281 --> 17:55.516
<b>So what are we doing?</b>

17:55.616 --> 17:57.118
<b>- I want a Venetian mask</b>
<b>that's nature inspired,</b>

17:57.284 --> 17:59.386
<b>that has butterflies and flowers</b>
<b>all around it.</b>

17:59.487 --> 18:00.521
<b>- What are you looking to get?</b>

18:00.621 --> 18:02.456
<b>- A horror-themed</b>
<b>Venetian mask tattoo,</b>

18:02.556 --> 18:06.861
<b>with barbwire incorporated,</b>
<b>flames, and demonic eyes.</b>

18:06.961 --> 18:09.964
<b>- Wackiest idea I've heard</b>
<b>in my life.</b>

18:10.064 --> 18:11.632
<b> <i>Makes no sense at all.</i> </b>

18:11.732 --> 18:12.800
<b>- Good luck with that.</b>

18:12.900 --> 18:14.802
<b>- I would like a Venetian mask</b>

18:14.902 --> 18:18.005
<b>with roses incorporated</b>
<b>in dedication to my aunts.</b>

18:18.105 --> 18:19.306
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:19.373 --> 18:21.409
<b>- I want three roses</b>
<b>because I have three aunts</b>

18:21.509 --> 18:23.310
<b>who have cancer.</b>

18:23.377 --> 18:24.945
<b>- Black-and-gray, color?</b>
<b>- Color.</b>

18:25.045 --> 18:26.680
<b> <i>- This is a tough canvas,</i> </b>

18:26.781 --> 18:29.150
<b>and she's too emotionally</b>
<b>attached to her concept.</b>

18:29.316 --> 18:31.385
<b> <i>She's not gonna be easy</i> </b>
<b> <i>to work with.</i> </b>

18:35.823 --> 18:37.625
<b>- You guys, let's switch.</b>

18:38.926 --> 18:40.661
<b>Let me see which one you got</b>
<b>again.</b>

18:40.761 --> 18:43.931
<b>Okay.</b> <b>All right.</b>

18:44.031 --> 18:47.101
<b>- Okay, canvases, one by one,</b>
<b>please read the artist's name</b>

18:47.268 --> 18:48.803
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

18:48.903 --> 18:51.338
<b>- Alex.</b>
<b>- Hello.</b>

18:51.439 --> 18:53.407
<b>- Cleen Rock One.</b>
<b>- Ooh, that's me.</b>

18:53.507 --> 18:55.576
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

18:59.713 --> 19:00.948
<b>- Matti.</b>

19:01.048 --> 19:02.316
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- [bleep] yeah, dude.</b>

19:02.416 --> 19:04.819
<b>Barbwire all day, bro.</b>
<b>- Oh, just wait, buddy.</b>

19:04.919 --> 19:06.187
<b>Obviously I'm gonna get the</b>

19:06.287 --> 19:09.056
<b>barbwire, flame, skin-ripped</b>
<b>zombie mask.</b>

19:09.156 --> 19:10.591
<b> <i>This is the only one</i> </b>
<b> <i>that I was afraid of.</i> </b>

19:10.691 --> 19:12.726
<b>- You picked it, bro.</b>

19:12.827 --> 19:14.295
<b>Matti has an advantage</b>
<b>because he's probably the</b>

19:14.328 --> 19:16.397
<b>only one who's ever done</b>
<b>a Venetian mask, ever.</b>

19:16.497 --> 19:18.999
<b> <i>So I'm gonna make sure that</i> </b>
<b> <i>I stump him right off the gate.</i> </b>

19:19.100 --> 19:20.401
<b>- Picasso.</b>

19:20.501 --> 19:22.803
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

19:22.903 --> 19:25.506
<b>- Sausage.</b>
<b>- You and I.</b>

19:28.809 --> 19:30.211
<b>- Anthony.</b>

19:30.311 --> 19:31.345
<b>- Mm.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:31.445 --> 19:32.847
<b> <i>- This canvas wants full color.</i> </b>

19:32.947 --> 19:34.749
<b>With her complexion</b>
<b>and the challenge being detail,</b>

19:34.849 --> 19:37.318
<b> <i>it's gonna be a muddy mess.</i> </b>

19:37.384 --> 19:38.719
<b> <i>Aw, Cleen, you're smarter</i> </b>
<b> <i>than you look.</i> </b>

19:38.819 --> 19:41.088
<b>You got a little bit</b>
<b>of strategy; Good job.</b>

19:41.255 --> 19:42.490
<b>- Christian.</b>

19:42.590 --> 19:43.758
<b>- Yes.</b>

19:43.858 --> 19:45.426
<b>- Remember, guys,</b>
<b>after the elimination tattoo,</b>

19:45.526 --> 19:49.430
<b>the human canvas jury will vote</b>
<b>on the tattoo that they think</b>

19:49.530 --> 19:51.632
<b>is the worst and put one artist</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

19:51.732 --> 19:53.901
<b>- Dun dun dun.</b>

19:54.001 --> 19:58.539
<b>- You will have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo a Venetian mask.</b>

19:58.639 --> 20:03.110
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

20:03.277 --> 20:04.345
<b>Good luck.</b>

20:04.445 --> 20:07.548
<b>- Venetian mask is very</b>
<b>detail-oriented design.</b>

20:07.648 --> 20:10.651
<b>- You want the actual mask</b>
<b>to look like wood?</b>

20:10.751 --> 20:13.287
<b> <i>- There's a lot of</i> </b>
<b> <i>different styles and a lot of</i> </b>

20:13.354 --> 20:15.289
<b>very explicit details that you</b>
<b>can put into these masks.</b>

20:15.322 --> 20:18.292
<b> <i>So the artist can</i> </b>
<b> <i>really be creative.</i> </b>

20:20.661 --> 20:22.430
<b>- Three roses</b>
<b>for your aunts, right?</b>

20:22.530 --> 20:24.298
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>And their initials in each rose.</b>

20:24.398 --> 20:27.668
<b>- It's gonna be busy, and</b>
<b>then I'm thinking about time.</b>

20:27.768 --> 20:30.004
<b>- Just so I know that</b>
<b>each rose represents...</b>

20:30.104 --> 20:31.305
<b>- You can separate them.</b>
<b>- For each aunt.</b>

20:31.338 --> 20:33.574
<b>I understand that it's a</b>
<b>memorial tattoo,</b>

20:33.674 --> 20:36.143
<b> <i>but I need to change her mind</i> </b>
<b> <i>because it's a competition.</i> </b>

20:36.310 --> 20:38.579
<b>This [bleep] will get me sent</b>
<b>home.</b>

20:38.679 --> 20:41.115
<b>- I'd like to incorporate</b>
<b>barbwire kind of, like, around,</b>

20:41.248 --> 20:42.483
<b>like, maybe, like,</b>
<b>the eye area or something.</b>

20:42.583 --> 20:45.686
<b>- I'm not sure about barbwire</b>
<b>mixing in with this too well.</b>

20:45.786 --> 20:47.254
<b>- I think flames</b>
<b>would look cool in a mask.</b>

20:47.321 --> 20:49.857
<b>- I don't think there's</b>
<b>one person in 6 billion</b>

20:49.957 --> 20:51.258
<b>on the planet that's ever done</b>

20:51.292 --> 20:53.260
<b> <i>a Venetian mask</i> </b>
<b> <i>with barbwire and flames.</i> </b>

20:53.294 --> 20:55.262
<b>- Halloween's my favorite</b>
<b>holiday of the year,</b>

20:55.296 --> 20:57.431
<b>so I was thinking, like,</b>
<b>a horror element,</b>

20:57.531 --> 20:58.833
<b>so when someone sees it,</b>
<b>they're like, "Oh," like,</b>

20:58.933 --> 21:02.436
<b>they can tell, like, this guy's</b>
<b>into, like, horror stuff.</b>

21:02.536 --> 21:04.972
<b>- I just got here,</b>
<b>and I'm screwed already.</b>

21:08.621 --> 21:11.491
<b> <i>[tense rock music]</i> </b>

21:11.591 --> 21:12.692
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

21:12.792 --> 21:14.060
<b>- Tell me about this Matti guy.</b>

21:14.160 --> 21:16.196
<b>- I was so bummed when</b>
<b>I saw him come in the door.</b>

21:16.296 --> 21:17.296
<b>- Really?</b>

21:17.363 --> 21:18.298
<b>- He put me through</b>
<b>a lot of turmoil.</b>

21:18.398 --> 21:20.033
<b>Him and Scott Marshall</b>
<b>joined forces.</b>

21:20.133 --> 21:21.568
<b>They were always trying</b>
<b>to figure out a way</b>

21:21.668 --> 21:22.669
<b>to just knock me out.</b>

21:22.769 --> 21:23.903
<b>- He's almost kind of</b>
<b>like your rival.</b>

21:24.003 --> 21:25.271
<b>- I can't say that</b>
<b>if I get the skull pick</b>

21:25.371 --> 21:28.341
<b>that I wouldn't be handing out</b>
<b>a little bit of vengeance.</b>

21:28.441 --> 21:31.478
<b>- I don't know the Matti guy,</b>
<b>but I'm not gonna take sides.</b>

21:31.578 --> 21:33.313
<b>- So if Jason Clay Dunn</b>
<b>came back to this season,</b>

21:33.413 --> 21:35.482
<b>how do you think</b>
<b>that you would feel?</b>

21:35.582 --> 21:38.184
<b>- Yeah, I can see</b>
<b>where you're coming from.</b>

21:38.284 --> 21:40.453
<b>- As much as I want the veterans</b>
<b>to make it to the end,</b>

21:40.553 --> 21:42.555
<b>I can't say that I wouldn't</b>
<b>want to make Matti's trip</b>

21:42.655 --> 21:44.657
<b>a little bit tougher.</b>

21:44.758 --> 21:46.092
<b>- I get it.</b>

21:47.460 --> 21:48.962
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>Matti called the shot.</b>

21:49.062 --> 21:51.965
<b>You have six hours to tattoo</b>
<b>a Venetian mask.</b>

21:52.065 --> 21:53.533
<b>And your time...</b>

21:53.633 --> 21:53.967
<b>starts...</b>

21:54.067 --> 21:54.868
<b>now.</b>

21:54.968 --> 21:56.870
<b>- Awesome.</b>

21:56.970 --> 21:58.104
<b>- Just look straight ahead</b>
<b>for me.</b>

21:58.204 --> 22:01.374
<b>- This week we're testing</b>
<b>the artists on detail.</b>

22:01.474 --> 22:03.943
<b>There's basically endless</b>
<b>amounts of different styles</b>

22:04.043 --> 22:05.345
<b> <i>of Venetian masks</i> </b>
<b> <i>and different details</i> </b>

22:05.445 --> 22:07.147
<b> <i>they can put into these tattoos.</i> </b>

22:08.448 --> 22:09.749
<b>- Yes, I am.</b>

22:09.849 --> 22:12.452
<b> <i>- Each week this competition</i> </b>
<b> <i>gets tighter and tighter.</i> </b>

22:12.552 --> 22:13.620
<b>It's anyone's game.</b>

22:13.720 --> 22:14.720
<b>- Relax, okay?</b>

22:17.624 --> 22:18.291
<b>- I know it's a competition</b>
<b>for you, but I just want</b>

22:18.358 --> 22:20.427
<b>an awesome-ass design.</b>

22:20.527 --> 22:23.730
<b>- My canvas wants barbwire,</b>
<b>flames, and zombies.</b>

22:23.830 --> 22:27.300
<b>I talk him into a Venetian mask</b>
<b>with one of those long noses</b>

22:27.400 --> 22:29.803
<b>that's a little bit more</b>
<b>fantastical and creepy.</b>

22:29.903 --> 22:32.705
<b>- As long as they have a cool,</b>
<b>like, dark-theme look to it,</b>

22:32.806 --> 22:33.806
<b>I'm satisfied.</b>

22:33.840 --> 22:34.840
<b>- No problem.</b>

22:36.976 --> 22:38.178
<b>Cleen is a moron.</b>

22:38.311 --> 22:39.379
<b>Why the hell would you give me</b>

22:39.479 --> 22:41.314
<b> <i>the worst canvas</i> </b>
<b> <i>when I come in here?</i> </b>

22:41.381 --> 22:42.782
<b>If Cleen was smart, he'd be</b>
<b>gunning for Sausage right now.</b>

22:42.882 --> 22:46.953
<b>He is a rule-abiding,</b>
<b>manipulative, little shyster.</b>

22:47.053 --> 22:48.188
<b>- Go big or go home.</b>

22:48.321 --> 22:50.957
<b>- Go big and stay here.</b>
<b>- Go big and stay here.</b>

22:51.057 --> 22:52.692
<b>Matti's after me,</b>
<b>but I'm not worried.</b>

22:52.792 --> 22:55.032
<b>This will be one that you'll</b>
<b>definitely want to show off.</b>

22:55.095 --> 22:57.964
<b>I'm in the top of my game,</b>
<b>and I'm here to win.</b>

22:58.064 --> 22:59.065
<b>I don't mess around.</b>

22:59.165 --> 23:01.501
<b>- Tell you what,</b>
<b>you better do a good job.</b>

23:01.601 --> 23:04.037
<b> <i>We haven't been able to</i> </b>
<b> <i>take out a single veteran yet.</i> </b>

23:04.137 --> 23:05.672
<b>It's starting</b>
<b>to look bad for us,</b>

23:05.772 --> 23:07.307
<b>and we need to break this trend.</b>

23:07.407 --> 23:08.174
<b>See what this</b>
<b>crazy bastard's doing.</b>

23:08.274 --> 23:11.111
<b>- We are killing the detail.</b>

23:11.277 --> 23:13.046
<b>- Yeah, not too bad,</b>
<b>for a beginner.</b>

23:13.146 --> 23:14.180
<b> <i>This is do-or-die.</i> </b>

23:14.280 --> 23:15.882
<b>Don't care who leaves</b>
<b>or how they leave,</b>

23:15.982 --> 23:17.450
<b>just as long as they leave.</b>

23:17.550 --> 23:20.120
<b>- Four hours remaining, guys.</b>
<b>Four more hours.</b>

23:26.926 --> 23:28.294
<b>This is stressful.</b>

23:28.328 --> 23:30.864
<b>As each new veteran comes in,</b>
<b>I'm not really able</b>

23:30.964 --> 23:32.031
<b>to find my footing.</b>

23:32.132 --> 23:34.033
<b>They're coming in</b>
<b>with all the advantage.</b>

23:34.134 --> 23:37.203
<b>They're finalists.</b>
<b>These people aren't jokes.</b>

23:37.303 --> 23:39.339
<b> <i>They've tasted a win;</i> </b>
<b> <i>they want it;</i> </b>

23:39.439 --> 23:42.142
<b> <i>And they know</i> </b>
<b> <i>how to play the game.</i> </b>

23:42.308 --> 23:43.388
<b>What's happening over here?</b>

23:43.476 --> 23:44.476
<b>- Oh, boy.</b>

23:44.544 --> 23:46.479
<b>- Came over to make fun of you.</b>

23:46.579 --> 23:49.649
<b>Cleen and I have actually</b>
<b>kind of found each other.</b>

23:49.749 --> 23:51.651
<b>- Thank God we stayed up late</b>
<b>practicing our traditional...</b>

23:51.751 --> 23:52.886
<b>- I know.</b>

23:52.986 --> 23:54.854
<b>I didn't get to do</b>
<b>that cool snake, though.</b>

23:54.954 --> 23:56.322
<b>- That would have been awesome.</b>

23:56.389 --> 23:57.490
<b> <i>- If Cleen wants to flirt</i> </b>
<b> <i>with me</i> </b>

23:57.590 --> 23:58.224
<b> <i>and lighten the mood sometimes,</i> </b>

23:58.324 --> 24:00.894
<b>that's fine with me.</b>

24:00.994 --> 24:03.163
<b>Have fun.</b> <b>- I'm going to.</b>

24:03.329 --> 24:05.565
<b>- Cleen seems pretty rad</b>
<b>at this point.</b>

24:07.167 --> 24:09.436
<b>- What up, buddy?</b>

24:09.536 --> 24:11.905
<b>Not only do I have to defeat</b>
<b>everybody here, but I also</b>

24:12.005 --> 24:14.307
<b>have to battle</b>
<b>the demons in my head.</b>

24:14.407 --> 24:15.508
<b>- Are you loving it?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:15.608 --> 24:18.111
<b>Today it just has to be</b>
<b>another tattoo to me.</b>

24:18.278 --> 24:20.413
<b>Can't get caught up</b>
<b>on the fact that I've never</b>

24:20.513 --> 24:22.182
<b>done of Venetian mask</b>
<b>or that there's a lot of detail.</b>

24:22.282 --> 24:25.285
<b>I just have to nail it.</b>

24:25.385 --> 24:28.388
<b>- Two more hours.</b>
<b>Two more hours.</b>

24:32.125 --> 24:33.765
<b>- How was the artist</b>
<b>that was next to you?</b>

24:35.495 --> 24:36.763
<b>Some of these guys they start</b>
<b>out, and they only want to</b>

24:36.863 --> 24:39.599
<b>tattoo their style;</b>
<b>but, I mean, that's the thing.</b>

24:39.699 --> 24:41.835
<b>I'm not shocked by anything</b>
<b>that's thrown at me.</b>

24:41.935 --> 24:43.136
<b>I won the flash challenge.</b>

24:43.303 --> 24:45.138
<b>Now I'm gonna win</b>
<b>the elimination tattoo.</b>

24:45.305 --> 24:46.339

24:51.578 --> 24:53.413
<b>Give me any style,</b>
<b>I'm gonna rock it.</b>

24:53.513 --> 24:55.348

<b>I hope they all drop the ball.</b>

25:03.323 --> 25:04.791
<b>Turn that thing up, Anthony.</b>

25:04.891 --> 25:05.891

<b> <i>Cleen's definitely out</i> </b>

25:11.264 --> 25:12.432
<b>Come around and take a look.</b>

25:12.532 --> 25:15.335
<b>She wanted initials in the</b>
<b>petals for the three aunts,</b>

25:15.435 --> 25:16.536
<b>but we didn't want to, like,</b>
<b>explode them on</b>

25:16.636 --> 25:19.906
<b>and then just some bulb initial</b>
<b>on the petals.</b>

25:20.006 --> 25:22.275
<b>- I only have six hours to do</b>
<b>this, and I'm not trying</b>

25:22.308 --> 25:23.543
<b>to shoot myself in the foot.</b>

25:23.643 --> 25:25.412
<b> <i>So we're simplifying</i> </b>
<b> <i>this completely.</i> </b>

25:25.512 --> 25:27.280
<b>I'm gonna finish the mask on</b>
<b>this side</b>

25:27.347 --> 25:28.181
<b>before I start the other</b>
<b>two rows and background.</b>

25:28.281 --> 25:30.183
<b>- Very good.</b>

25:33.019 --> 25:35.955
<b>- I might do this shadow a</b>
<b>little bit more on the flower</b>

25:36.056 --> 25:37.524
<b>because it is kind of settled.</b>

25:37.624 --> 25:40.360
<b> <i>This tattoo has to be awesome,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but I got the guy</i> </b>

25:40.460 --> 25:43.430
<b>who wanted the redwood tree,</b>
<b>a mask, and a flower.</b>

25:43.530 --> 25:44.764
<b>[sighs]</b>
<b>- What kind of flower is that?</b>

25:44.864 --> 25:46.433
<b>- A Phoebe flower.</b>

25:46.533 --> 25:48.902
<b>It's a hard canvas;</b>
<b>it doesn't make any sense;</b>

25:49.002 --> 25:50.042

25:56.476 --> 25:58.645
<b>I can't take it anymore.</b>

25:58.745 --> 26:00.814
<b>I just want this little dick</b>

<b>- Awesome job, man.</b> <b>I love it.</b>

26:17.697 --> 26:19.733

<b>actually, really choppy</b>

30:50.660 --> 30:52.195
<b> <i>when you get up close,</i> </b>

31:09.145 --> 31:11.147
<b> <i>There's nothing really</i> </b>

<b> <i>Looking at the details,</i> </b>

31:13.549 --> 31:14.484
<b> <i>there's still a lot of problems</i> </b>
<b> <i>with your outline.</i> </b>

31:14.584 --> 31:17.520
<b> <i>You're not cleanly</i> </b>
<b> <i>pulling lines.</i> </b>

31:17.620 --> 31:19.822
<b>Reason that everything looks</b>
<b>scribbled and sketched in</b>

31:19.922 --> 31:21.023
<b>is because it is...</b>

31:21.124 --> 31:22.458
<b>- I didn't scribble</b>
<b>anything in there.</b>

31:22.558 --> 31:24.060
<b>- Scribbled and sketched in.</b>
<b>- I pulled my lines.</b>

31:24.160 --> 31:25.880
<b> <i>- See that left hook of the</i> </b>
<b> <i>horn on the top?</i> </b>

31:25.962 --> 31:27.096
<b> <i>See that line?</i> </b>

31:27.196 --> 31:28.631
<b> <i>There's, like, a thousand</i> </b>
<b> <i>pickups.</i> </b>

31:28.731 --> 31:32.168

<b>- Feel like this is</b>
<b>the best one I've done.</b>

31:33.469 --> 31:35.738
<b>- If you're competing for</b>
<b>your life in this thing,</b>

31:35.838 --> 31:37.974
<b>then you just don't want</b>
<b>to leave anything suspect</b>

31:38.074 --> 31:39.074
<b>or to question.</b>

31:41.878 --> 31:42.878
<b>- Alex.</b>

31:45.348 --> 31:47.183
<b>Talk to me about what</b>
<b>your canvas asked for.</b>

31:47.316 --> 31:48.836

<b>a Venetian mask with</b>

31:48.918 --> 31:50.586
<b> <i>a redwood tree, and then</i> </b>
<b> <i>he wanted a Phoebe flower,</i> </b>

31:50.686 --> 31:53.322
<b>'cause his daughter's name</b>
<b>is Phoebe.</b>

31:53.389 --> 31:54.390
<b>- The way these three elements</b>

31:54.490 --> 31:56.826
<b>were put together</b>
<b>was just very strange.</b>

31:56.926 --> 31:59.162
<b> <i>- I feel like there's a way</i> </b>
<b> <i>to portray a redwood tree</i> </b>

31:59.328 --> 32:00.630
<b> <i>that's not one curved stick</i> </b>

32:00.730 --> 32:02.865
<b> <i>coming out a mask</i> </b>
<b> <i>and going to nowhere.</i> </b>

32:02.965 --> 32:05.601
<b>- He thought it perfectly</b>
<b>represented a redwood, so I was</b>

32:05.701 --> 32:07.336
<b>like, "Let me just do it; I'll</b>
<b>probably get [bleep] on for it."</b>

32:07.403 --> 32:09.672
<b>- You are correct, sir.</b>

32:09.772 --> 32:11.541
<b> <i>- This being a redwood tree,</i> </b>
<b> <i>which is supposed to be</i> </b>

32:11.641 --> 32:13.976
<b> <i>the largest type of tree</i> </b>
<b> <i>that we know,</i> </b>

32:14.076 --> 32:15.511
<b>you're not pulling it off.</b>

32:17.847 --> 32:19.148
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

32:20.116 --> 32:22.585
<b>- Not a lot of great examples</b>
<b>of detail.</b>

32:22.685 --> 32:24.353
<b> <i>The edges of the mask where it</i> </b>
<b> <i>swirls up and bends around</i> </b>

32:24.387 --> 32:26.389
<b> <i>is just pretty weak.</i> </b>

32:26.489 --> 32:28.524
<b> <i>Details in the little</i> </b>
<b> <i>leaves inside,</i> </b>

32:28.624 --> 32:30.359
<b> <i>lot of weak little</i> </b>
<b> <i>scratchy outlines.</i> </b>

32:30.426 --> 32:33.095
<b>Honestly, man, nothing about</b>
<b>this tattoo is really impressive</b>

32:33.196 --> 32:34.430
<b> <i>or screaming that you're</i> </b>
<b> <i>competing with</i> </b>

32:34.530 --> 32:36.732
<b>the top people</b>
<b>in the room today.</b>

32:36.833 --> 32:37.873
<b>- I thought that the roots</b>

32:37.934 --> 32:40.303
<b>gave me opportunity</b>
<b>for a lot of detail.</b>

32:40.336 --> 32:41.437
<b> <i>- You can say whatever you want.</i> </b>

32:41.537 --> 32:43.137
<b> <i>This thing is one of the</i> </b>
<b> <i>weakest drawings</i> </b>

32:43.172 --> 32:44.407
<b> <i>of the day, by far.</i> </b>

32:44.507 --> 32:47.677
<b>You have to overcome bad ideas</b>
<b>with good art.</b>

32:49.712 --> 32:51.647
<b>- All right, guys, it is time</b>
<b>to determine</b>

32:51.747 --> 32:53.716
<b>who had the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

32:53.816 --> 32:55.885
<b>- Hitting the challenge,</b>
<b>hitting a Venetian mask,</b>

32:55.985 --> 32:59.322
<b>also hitting the detail...</b>
<b>obviously Cleen has one of</b>

32:59.388 --> 33:01.090
<b> <i>the strongest tattoos</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the day.</i> </b>

33:01.190 --> 33:02.825
<b>- Runaway train.</b>

33:02.925 --> 33:04.193
<b>Going with Cleen.</b>

33:04.327 --> 33:07.530
<b>- The judges have decided that</b>
<b>the best tattoo of the day</b>

33:07.630 --> 33:09.232
<b>goes to Cleen.</b>

33:10.833 --> 33:13.436
<b>The human canvas jury</b>
<b>is deliberating right now.</b>

33:13.536 --> 33:16.506
<b>Their vote will put one artist</b>
<b>up for elimination,</b>

33:16.606 --> 33:19.976
<b>and the canvas will be here</b>
<b>to tell us why.</b>

33:20.076 --> 33:21.611
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

33:21.711 --> 33:24.714
<b>One of you is about to pack</b>
<b>your machines.</b>

33:29.585 --> 33:31.354
<b>- Feel like I'm being forced</b>
<b>into doing tattoos</b>

33:31.420 --> 33:33.456
<b>that don't look like</b>
<b>St. Marq did them.</b>

33:33.556 --> 33:34.824
<b>I didn't even try</b>
<b>to break the rules!</b>

33:34.924 --> 33:36.058
<b>I'm a rule-breaker.</b>

33:36.159 --> 33:36.692
<b>What the [bleep] am I doing</b>
<b>following the rules?</b>

33:36.793 --> 33:38.928
<b>- I don't know.</b>

33:39.028 --> 33:40.196
<b>- Yeah, I don't want to go home</b>
<b>on that piece of [bleep].</b>

33:40.296 --> 33:41.831
<b>- So you think that you would</b>
<b>have the same attitude</b>

33:41.931 --> 33:43.833
<b>going down there if you got</b>
<b>Alex's critique?</b>

33:43.933 --> 33:44.933
<b>- What do you mean?</b>

33:45.001 --> 33:46.302
<b>- Would you act the same way?</b>
<b>Would you...</b>

33:46.369 --> 33:47.649
<b>- Oh, towards the judges?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

33:47.737 --> 33:48.471
<b>- No [bleep] way.</b>

33:48.571 --> 33:49.839
<b>- The less you respect them,</b>

33:49.939 --> 33:51.841
<b>the more you've punched</b>
<b>your ticket to go home.</b>

33:51.941 --> 33:52.942
<b>- I agree with you.</b>

33:53.042 --> 33:54.310
<b>- I mean, you guys</b>
<b>are building my critique</b>

33:54.377 --> 33:55.611
<b>like I strung them up.</b>

33:55.711 --> 33:57.013
<b>- You just disassociate</b>
<b>with the whole thing.</b>

33:57.113 --> 33:59.482
<b>- I [bleep] up; I get it.</b>

33:59.582 --> 34:01.584
<b>- If you can just go down there</b>
<b>and just listen...</b>

34:01.684 --> 34:03.619
<b>- Shut the [bleep] up,</b>
<b>you douchebag.</b>

34:03.719 --> 34:04.654
<b>- You're not even respecting</b>
<b>him right now.</b>

34:04.754 --> 34:06.322
<b>We're talking about a level...</b>
<b>a lack...</b>

34:06.355 --> 34:07.824
<b>- [mocking] I'm not even</b>
<b>respecting him, right now?</b>

34:07.924 --> 34:09.025
<b>Is that not what I'm doing?</b>

34:09.125 --> 34:10.326
<b>- A lack of disrespect.</b>
<b>- A lack, a lack of...</b>

34:10.393 --> 34:12.462
<b>Get the [bleep] out</b>
<b>of my face, you [bleep].</b>

34:12.562 --> 34:14.664
<b>I'll [bleep] knock</b>
<b>your fat ass out, bitch!</b>

34:14.764 --> 34:16.933
<b>- Lack of disrespect!</b>
<b>- What's up mother[bleep]?</b>

34:20.636 --> 34:24.639
<b>- If I sneeze, you're gonna</b>
<b>[bleep] fly across the room.</b>

34:24.739 --> 34:26.976
<b>- You're tough; You're tough.</b>
<b>I got you.</b>

34:28.811 --> 34:30.246
<b>- [bleep] pussy!</b>

34:30.346 --> 34:30.980
<b>- Love you, too...</b>
<b>- Why don't you bring it, bitch?</b>

34:31.080 --> 34:32.748
<b>- Love you too, sweetie.</b>

34:32.849 --> 34:33.516
<b>- I stood up first,</b>
<b>mother[bleep]!</b>

34:33.616 --> 34:35.518
<b>I'm ready when you are!</b>

34:42.362 --> 34:45.031
<b>- Today we're testing details</b>
<b>with Venetian masks.</b>

34:45.130 --> 34:46.731
<b>Let's talk about</b>
<b>the bottom of the field.</b>

34:46.766 --> 34:49.502
<b>- I made no bones about it.</b>
<b>I want to see Megan down here.</b>

34:49.601 --> 34:51.938
<b> <i>- It takes a lot to try to</i> </b>
<b> <i>figure out what's going on.</i> </b>

34:52.038 --> 34:53.606
<b> <i>And from any amount of distance,</i> </b>

34:53.706 --> 34:55.742
<b> <i>none of this detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>separates itself.</i> </b>

34:55.842 --> 34:59.445
<b>- And I'm thinking I can't get</b>
<b>past Alex's design.</b>

34:59.546 --> 35:02.882
<b> <i>It is the most uncomfortably</i> </b>
<b> <i>placed collection of elements</i> </b>

35:02.982 --> 35:05.385
<b>put together in a very</b>
<b>strange way.</b>

35:05.485 --> 35:07.053
<b> <i>- Nobody is gonna look at</i> </b>
<b> <i>that and be like,</i> </b>

35:07.153 --> 35:09.088
<b>"Oh, yeah, redwood tree."</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

35:09.189 --> 35:11.157
<b>- Alex has a challenged</b>
<b>artistic eye,</b>

35:11.257 --> 35:15.028
<b>but he's more technically</b>
<b>skilled than Picasso.</b>

35:15.128 --> 35:16.529
<b> <i>- It's scratchy.</i> </b> <b> <i>It's messy.</i> </b>

35:16.629 --> 35:18.189
<b> <i>They're areas of it</i> </b>
<b> <i>that are reminiscent</i> </b>

35:18.231 --> 35:19.766
<b>of his other</b>
<b>weak, muddy tattoos.</b>

35:19.866 --> 35:21.501
<b>- It's a big letdown.</b>

35:21.601 --> 35:23.636
<b>- The human canvas jury is gonna</b>
<b>vote on an artist, too,</b>

35:23.736 --> 35:25.696
<b>and their vote's gonna</b>
<b>send someone to the bottom.</b>

35:28.441 --> 35:31.110
<b>- We are here to determine who</b>
<b>has the worst tattoo of the day.</b>

35:31.211 --> 35:34.547
<b>- That's my tattoo,</b>
<b>and my artist is Anthony.</b>

35:34.647 --> 35:35.949
<b> <i>- The detail just isn't</i> </b>
<b> <i>quite there...</i> </b>

35:36.049 --> 35:38.084
<b>- It's a detail challenge, and</b>
<b>there's not a lot of detail.</b>

35:38.184 --> 35:40.024
<b>- It's like he put more detail</b>
<b>into the flowers</b>

35:40.053 --> 35:41.254
<b> <i>than he did the actual mask.</i> </b>

35:41.354 --> 35:43.123
<b>- I'd like for the mask</b>
<b>to pop out more.</b>

35:43.223 --> 35:44.691
<b> <i>Doesn't really, like, stand out.</i> </b>

35:46.693 --> 35:48.962
<b>- That's my tattoo.</b>
<b>My artist was St. Marq.</b>

35:49.062 --> 35:50.363
<b> <i>- It almost looks like scales.</i> </b>

35:50.430 --> 35:51.698
<b> <i>- Supposed to be like</i> </b>
<b> <i>cracked porcelain.</i> </b>

35:51.798 --> 35:52.932
<b> <i>- Like, it almost looks like</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's a lizard</i> </b>

35:53.032 --> 35:54.200
<b>instead of cracks.</b>

35:54.367 --> 35:56.369
<b>- Proportion to the tree</b>
<b>doesn't really fit.</b>

35:56.402 --> 35:59.038
<b> <i>It kind of looks like one big</i> </b>
<b> <i>bush on top of a mask.</i> </b>

35:59.139 --> 36:02.175
<b>- That's my tattoo.</b>
<b>My artist was Alex.</b>

36:02.275 --> 36:03.376
<b>-</b><b> <i>There's too many little,</i> </b>
<b> <i>random things.</i> </b>

36:03.443 --> 36:06.412
<b> <i>The flowers randomly</i> </b>
<b> <i>coming out of the...</i> </b>

36:06.513 --> 36:08.648
<b> <i>it looks like</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's coming out of the tree?</i> </b>

36:08.748 --> 36:11.751
<b>- I did want more flowers, but</b>
<b>he talked me into just one,</b>

36:11.851 --> 36:12.952
<b> <i>which I thought was fine.</i> </b>

36:13.052 --> 36:14.521
<b>- It kills me because</b>
<b>it looks like it's just</b>

36:14.621 --> 36:17.490
<b>coming right out of the tree,</b>
<b>which doesn't make much sense.</b>

36:17.590 --> 36:18.725
<b>- Which is the detail,</b>
<b>which is the whole idea of what</b>

36:18.825 --> 36:22.095
<b>we're supposed to be doing.</b>

36:22.195 --> 36:23.263
<b>- Who's nervous?</b>

36:23.396 --> 36:24.864
<b>- Well, I know</b>
<b>I'm going down there.</b>

36:24.964 --> 36:26.599
<b>Chris promised me a date.</b>

36:26.699 --> 36:28.234
<b>- That's the first time I've</b>
<b>ever heard him say,</b>

36:28.401 --> 36:30.203
<b>"We'll see you down here later."</b>

36:30.303 --> 36:32.405
<b>- I have a feeling</b>
<b>that I'm going home.</b>

36:35.275 --> 36:36.376
<b>- Here we go.</b>

36:38.645 --> 36:40.513
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>the judges want to see...</b>

36:41.614 --> 36:43.483
<b>Megan,</b>

36:43.583 --> 36:44.583
<b>Alex,</b>

36:44.651 --> 36:47.120
<b>Picasso...</b>

36:48.788 --> 36:51.391
<b>And Anthony.</b>

36:51.491 --> 36:53.159
<b>- [bleep].</b>

36:53.259 --> 36:54.594
<b>- See y'all downstairs.</b>

36:54.694 --> 36:56.396
<b>- Taking four?</b>

36:56.496 --> 36:59.632
<b>- Let's go; Get down there</b>
<b>and get this [bleep] over with.</b>

36:59.732 --> 37:00.834
<b>- Good luck, everybody.</b>

37:00.934 --> 37:01.934
<b>- Yeah, good luck.</b>

37:10.376 --> 37:11.377
<b>- Today you had to show detail</b>

37:11.444 --> 37:15.381
<b>by tattooing an intricate</b>
<b>Venetian mask.</b>

37:15.415 --> 37:19.686
<b>Based on your work, one of you</b>
<b>will be packing your machines.</b>

37:19.786 --> 37:23.189
<b>It's time to find out who</b>
<b>the human canvas jury chose.</b>

37:27.393 --> 37:29.562
<b>Anthony, you're here</b>
<b>because the human canvas jury</b>

37:29.662 --> 37:31.965
<b>determined that you had</b>
<b>the worst tattoo of the day.</b>

37:32.065 --> 37:33.433
<b>- I can't comprehend that.</b>

37:33.533 --> 37:36.236
<b>- Ebony, why did the jury vote</b>
<b>Anthony to the bottom?</b>

37:36.336 --> 37:38.838
<b>- They said</b>
<b>there was lack of detail</b>

37:38.938 --> 37:41.374
<b>because there was no color,</b>
<b>and they felt like there wasn't</b>

37:41.474 --> 37:44.777
<b>enough symbols within</b>
<b>the mask itself.</b>

37:44.878 --> 37:45.878
<b>- I don't agree.</b>

37:45.912 --> 37:47.447
<b>I put everything I had</b>
<b>into that tattoo</b>

37:47.547 --> 37:48.948
<b>to give you what you wanted.</b>

37:49.048 --> 37:52.185
<b>- I appreciate what you did.</b>
<b>And I am totally satisfied.</b>

37:52.352 --> 37:54.487
<b>- Thank you so much, Ebony.</b>

37:54.587 --> 37:56.823
<b>- They know that this</b>
<b>is the detail challenge.</b>

37:56.923 --> 37:59.025
<b> <i>Realistically, your tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>is one of the ones</i> </b>

37:59.125 --> 38:00.794
<b>that has the least</b>
<b>amount of detail.</b>

38:00.894 --> 38:03.429
<b>- Considering her complexion,</b>
<b>I didn't want it to be</b>

38:03.530 --> 38:04.931
<b>too busy to where you can't even</b>
<b>tell what it is.</b>

38:05.031 --> 38:06.099
<b>Thought I made a good choice.</b>

38:06.199 --> 38:08.568
<b>- I don't agree with you</b>
<b>being down here.</b>

38:08.668 --> 38:12.539
<b>The tattooing is clean,</b>
<b>and your craftsmanship shows.</b>

38:12.639 --> 38:13.373
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

38:13.406 --> 38:14.841
<b>- I told you I'd see you.</b>

38:14.941 --> 38:15.975
<b>Your tattoo, it's hard to read.</b>

38:16.075 --> 38:17.195
<b> <i>- I do want to give you guys</i> </b>

38:17.277 --> 38:19.379
<b> <i>really clean, beautiful tattoos,</i> </b>

38:19.445 --> 38:21.881
<b> <i>but I needed to give</i> </b>
<b> <i>you guys a lot of detail.</i> </b>

38:21.981 --> 38:23.917
<b> <i>- You got to think about</i> </b>
<b> <i>the overall aesthetic</i> </b>

38:24.017 --> 38:26.119
<b> <i>of the tattoo, 'cause</i> </b>
<b> <i>if it's an unpleasing image,</i> </b>

38:26.219 --> 38:28.021
<b>it's definitely going home.</b>

38:28.121 --> 38:29.389
<b>- Alex.</b>

38:29.455 --> 38:31.615
<b>- You know, Alex, I really</b>
<b>wouldn't have been surprised</b>

38:31.658 --> 38:34.178
<b>if the human canvas jury picked</b>
<b>yours just because the fact that</b>

38:34.260 --> 38:35.962
<b> <i>the tree disappears</i> </b>
<b> <i>into the top.</i> </b>

38:36.062 --> 38:37.163
<b>- I'll do things that</b>
<b>don't make a whole lot of sense</b>

38:37.330 --> 38:40.700
<b>proportion-wise,</b>
<b>but there was texture in it,</b>

38:40.800 --> 38:41.968
<b>smooth shading</b>
<b>and the saturated color.</b>

38:42.068 --> 38:45.405
<b>- What this lacks</b>
<b>is artistic flow.</b>

38:45.505 --> 38:47.674
<b>- I could spend a little bit</b>
<b>more time with my composition.</b>

38:47.774 --> 38:49.843
<b>I could spend a little bit more</b>
<b>time just working on things,</b>

38:49.943 --> 38:51.344
<b>letting it flow!</b>

38:51.377 --> 38:52.679
<b>I can do some solid tattoos,</b>

38:52.779 --> 38:54.781
<b>and I can make them look</b>
<b>astoundingly awesome.</b>

38:54.881 --> 38:57.650
<b>I really can.</b>

38:57.750 --> 39:00.353
<b>- Picasso, whether we like</b>
<b>the artwork or we don't,</b>

39:00.420 --> 39:03.022
<b>it's got to have that</b>
<b>smooth execution.</b>

39:03.123 --> 39:05.358
<b>- From the last challenge,</b>
<b>I did make some improvements.</b>

39:05.425 --> 39:07.360
<b>The next one,</b>
<b>you'll see even better.</b>

39:07.460 --> 39:09.362
<b>- From a distance,</b>
<b>people are gonna not know</b>

39:09.395 --> 39:10.463
<b> <i>that this is a mask.</i> </b>

39:10.563 --> 39:12.065
<b> <i>If your details were</i> </b>
<b> <i>super crisp,</i> </b>

39:12.165 --> 39:13.366
<b> <i>and your outline looked</i> </b>
<b> <i>bulletproof,</i> </b>

39:13.433 --> 39:14.473
<b>it'd be a different story.</b>

39:14.534 --> 39:15.774
<b>- I know it was a weird design.</b>

39:15.869 --> 39:17.871
<b>Tried to do something different,</b>
<b>as always.</b>

39:17.971 --> 39:20.840
<b>- So now we have stronger</b>
<b>tattooing from Alex,</b>

39:20.940 --> 39:23.409
<b> <i>but then we have stronger</i> </b>
<b> <i>drawing from Picasso.</i> </b>

39:23.510 --> 39:25.945
<b>It makes for a really tough</b>
<b>decision here.</b>

39:27.447 --> 39:29.482
<b>- Time to make a decision, guys.</b>
<b>Who's going home?</b>

39:31.618 --> 39:34.254
<b>- Just going upon</b>
<b>the quality of the tattoo,</b>

39:34.387 --> 39:36.322
<b>I got to vote for Picasso.</b>

39:36.389 --> 39:38.992
<b>- Artistically, I'm more in line</b>
<b>with Picasso.</b>

39:39.092 --> 39:41.494
<b>My final vote is for Alex.</b>

39:45.865 --> 39:47.534
<b>- With a heavy heart,</b>

39:47.634 --> 39:49.169
<b>my final vote's for Picasso.</b>

39:49.335 --> 39:50.503
<b>- Judges have decided.</b>

39:50.603 --> 39:53.807
<b>Picasso, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:53.907 --> 39:56.342
<b>- We see your artistic ability,</b>
<b>and it's amazing.</b>

39:56.442 --> 39:57.844
<b>You had a really rough start,</b>

39:57.944 --> 40:00.713
<b>and the ball just really didn't</b>
<b>get rolling for you, man.</b>

40:00.814 --> 40:03.550
<b>- Please pack your machines,</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>

40:07.520 --> 40:10.924
<b>- Tattooing, to me,</b>
<b>is like a [bleep] dance.</b>

40:11.024 --> 40:13.726
<b>I'm not wondering what three</b>
<b>people are gonna think</b>

40:13.827 --> 40:15.161
<b>of what I'm doing.</b>

40:15.261 --> 40:18.431
<b>I guess I just can't tattoo</b>
<b>under these kind of conditions.</b>

40:23.503 --> 40:26.773
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</b>
<b>of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:26.873 --> 40:28.174
<b>- It's the badasses</b>
<b>versus the nonbadasses.</b>

40:28.274 --> 40:30.376
<b>- I'm really bummed</b>
<b>that there are</b>

40:30.443 --> 40:31.811
<b>more veterans than us right now.</b>

40:31.911 --> 40:32.946
<b> <i>I'm starting to see</i> </b>

40:33.046 --> 40:33.947
<b>Megan as more of a liability</b>
<b>than an asset.</b>

40:34.047 --> 40:35.248
<b>- Well, obviously...</b>

40:35.381 --> 40:36.549
<b>- I'm not the only one thought</b>
<b>it was a little whack.</b>

40:36.649 --> 40:37.851
<b>- Well, can you listen to me,</b>
<b>dude?</b>

40:37.951 --> 40:38.685
<b>- Now it's just time</b>
<b>for a strategy change.</b>

40:38.785 --> 40:40.753
<b>- [groans]</b>

40:40.854 --> 40:43.123
<b>- This guy will not sit through</b>
<b>what I have to give him.</b>

40:43.223 --> 40:45.024
<b>This is bull[bleep], yet again.</b>

40:45.125 --> 40:47.327
<b>- You're letting down</b>
<b>the veteran artists right now.</b>

40:47.393 --> 40:48.995
<b>- If you can't produce</b>
<b>a more dynamic drawing,</b>

40:49.095 --> 40:50.730
<b>you don't have a hope</b>
<b>of winning this thing.</b>

40:50.830 --> 40:52.732
<b>- This is it, man.</b>
<b>I... I want to be here.</b>

40:52.832 --> 40:54.672
<b>- It's not about surviving.</b>
<b>It's about winning.</b>

40:54.701 --> 40:56.803
<b>- It's a game, and that's</b>
<b>the way it crumbles, man.</b>
