06:55.284 --> 06:58.082
-Good luck tonight, Miss Mars.
-Thank you, Tommy.

06:59.844 --> 07:01.596
You are perfect.

07:02.244 --> 07:05.202
-How is it in there?
-Too early to tell.

07:05.444 --> 07:07.321
-We're about to be clotheslined.
-By whom?

07:07.564 --> 07:08.519
Sheila Weissman.

07:08.764 --> 07:10.641
Miss Mars, I'm Sheila Weissman.

07:10.884 --> 07:12.203
I remember you. How are you?

07:12.444 --> 07:15.516
We agreed that interviews
would be done inside the gallery.

07:15.764 --> 07:19.598
I want to ask her if she knows
how offensive her work is to women.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.564
-Cute.
-Let's go.

07:23.284 --> 07:25.718
Photography is becoming
a high-priced commodity.

07:25.924 --> 07:29.997
And there is suspicion
in some circles in the art world...

07:30.204 --> 07:32.764
...a feeling that we're running
out of salable paintings...

07:32.964 --> 07:35.239
...and photography
is being pumped up.

07:35.444 --> 07:37.639
That an artificial market
is being created...

07:37.884 --> 07:40.239
...and photography is just a hype.

07:40.484 --> 07:42.440
These are not easy
questions to answer...

07:42.684 --> 07:44.402
...but here in this gallery...

07:44.604 --> 07:48.119
...there is a fabulous exhibit
of violent and sexy photographs.

07:54.284 --> 07:55.763
Aren't you doing
a fashion hustle?

07:55.964 --> 07:57.522
Recycled photographs, really.

07:57.764 --> 08:00.232
Does anyone have
anything positive to ask?

08:00.484 --> 08:02.839
Do you consider yourself
a serious artist?

08:03.044 --> 08:06.434
-I'm very serious about my work.
-Serious by what standards?

08:06.644 --> 08:10.193
-By my own standards.
-lsn't that an elitist position?

08:10.484 --> 08:13.044
Honestly, I think
I'd better take the Fifth.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.401
You can do better than that,
Ms. Mars. Really.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.398
Fellas, come on.
Give us a break here, huh?

08:20.564 --> 08:23.442
She'll see you later, I promise.
I loved your questions.

08:23.684 --> 08:26.517
We have to mix
with the real people now.

08:39.164 --> 08:41.803
-ls there a back door?
-You are a sensation.

08:42.004 --> 08:43.642
You're the right
number of minutes late.

08:43.844 --> 08:45.402
Traffic was terrible.

08:45.604 --> 08:47.993
We are going to sell
pictures like crazy.

08:48.244 --> 08:49.882
Now, who shall we work on first?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.832
The art world is
being asked to consider...

08:53.084 --> 08:55.644
...these provocative pictures
as salable art.

08:55.884 --> 08:58.603
We'll be examining
these questions tonight...

08:58.844 --> 09:01.039
...and meeting people on all sides...

09:01.244 --> 09:03.917
...of what is rapidly
becoming a major controversy.

09:04.164 --> 09:06.632
I don't know when I've seen
more hostile reporters.

09:06.884 --> 09:10.001
If they don't stop drinking,
I'm gonna throw their asses out.

09:10.364 --> 09:13.162
-Have you seen Doris Spenser yet?
-No.

09:13.444 --> 09:15.639
What I think Laura is saying
with her work...

09:15.884 --> 09:20.799
...is "Okay, America.
Okay, world. You are violent.

09:21.004 --> 09:23.199
You are pushing all this murder on us.

09:23.404 --> 09:26.043
So here it comes right back at you.

09:26.284 --> 09:28.718
And we'll use murder
to sell deodorant...

09:28.964 --> 09:33.082
...so that you'll just get bored
with murder." Right?

09:40.484 --> 09:44.193
Oh, my God, I don't believe this.
Just a minute. Let me think.

09:44.444 --> 09:45.638
Do you have to do it now?

09:45.884 --> 09:50.241
-We want to question certain people.
-I understand.

09:50.484 --> 09:53.999
This will spread like wildfire.
It'll wreck the opening.

09:54.244 --> 09:57.395
-Can't you give us an hour?
-A half-hour.

09:58.244 --> 10:00.883
Really, that's so gross.

10:09.884 --> 10:11.442
I hear you did some work in Negev.

10:11.684 --> 10:14.801
I didn't have a chance
to take enough pictures...

10:15.004 --> 10:18.041
...so I'm going back in two weeks
to shoot the border war.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.242
-And if she goes, I'm going with her.
-She will too.

10:21.444 --> 10:23.400
Like hell you will.

10:26.084 --> 10:30.600
-Whatever happened to beautif ul?
-Well, it certainly isn't here.

10:32.764 --> 10:36.040
That is tragic. Absolutely tragic.

10:36.284 --> 10:37.763
You really think so?

10:38.244 --> 10:41.714
Yes, I think it's really tragic
that this is the kind of junk...

10:41.964 --> 10:44.194
...that's passing for art these days.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.038
That's a completely
different conversation.

10:48.244 --> 10:50.917
-Don't you think it's a hype?
-I don't understand...

10:51.284 --> 10:53.434
Hype, hustle, rip-off.

10:54.164 --> 10:55.597
Are you a critic?

10:59.484 --> 11:01.202
Do you know the artist?

11:01.604 --> 11:03.003
What's her name?

11:03.844 --> 11:05.402
Laura Mars.

11:06.204 --> 11:08.638
I know her fairly well.

11:09.764 --> 11:12.995
Well, if you see her,
will you point her out to me?

11:14.164 --> 11:15.756
I'd be interested to find out...

11:15.964 --> 11:19.001
...what kind of f rustrated
voyeur type this chick is.

11:21.044 --> 11:24.753
She's nothing like that at all.
She's very old-fashioned.

11:24.964 --> 11:27.000
Sort of like Grandma Moses.

11:29.364 --> 11:30.433
Laura.

11:31.084 --> 11:33.644
Ex cuse me. Could I
steal you away for a moment?

11:33.884 --> 11:35.203
Are you her?

11:38.684 --> 11:41.403
Her stuff is really disgracef ul,
don't you think?

11:42.284 --> 11:44.639
Doris Spenser's
been horribly murdered.

11:44.884 --> 11:48.593
There's a detective here,
and he's asking people questions.

11:49.004 --> 11:50.596
Oh, shit!

11:50.884 --> 11:52.476
Everything happens to me.

11:55.044 --> 11:56.318
Murdered.

11:59.404 --> 12:01.599
Something about her eyes.

12:03.364 --> 12:05.832
What did you say about her eyes?

12:06.044 --> 12:07.796
Something sharp.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.396
Let's get you a drink.

12:15.004 --> 12:16.119
Laura?

12:16.964 --> 12:18.556
Come on, darling.

12:20.244 --> 12:21.836
It's all right, Billy.

12:35.764 --> 12:37.914
Tonight at the
Elaine Cassell Gallery in Soho...

12:38.164 --> 12:40.200
...fans awaited
the famous and wealthy...

12:40.444 --> 12:42.799
...for the opening
of Laura Mars' Photo Exhibit.

12:43.044 --> 12:44.796
But the glamour was disrupted...

12:45.044 --> 12:47.604
...by news of the brutal murder
of Doris Spenser...

12:47.844 --> 12:51.200
...editor of the soon-to-be-published
book The Eyes of Mars.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.235
Miss Mars left
the gathering immediately.

12:53.484 --> 12:55.600
But as word
of the murder circulated...

12:55.804 --> 12:59.240
...it had the effect of increasing
sales of the photographs.

12:59.484 --> 13:01.395
More after this message.

13:08.484 --> 13:09.758
Elaine.

13:11.484 --> 13:13.759
I'm all right. Are you?

13:14.044 --> 13:18.322
We're all over the goddamn news.
The gallery, the murder, you, me.

13:19.444 --> 13:21.275
I don't think I'll be able to shoot.

13:21.484 --> 13:24.794
Of course you're going to shoot.
Life has to go on.

13:26.044 --> 13:27.318
Elaine...

13:30.804 --> 13:32.601
...do you believe in...

13:34.084 --> 13:34.880
...psychic...

13:35.764 --> 13:37.834
...psychic experience?

13:38.044 --> 13:39.602
I believe in a good night's sleep.

13:39.844 --> 13:43.041
I'm gonna take something
that'll knock me out for hours.

13:43.284 --> 13:44.763
I suggest you do the same.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.597
All right.

13:50.044 --> 13:52.114
The opening was beautif ul.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.236
That's very sweet of you.

13:55.444 --> 13:57.002
Sleep tight.

14:00.084 --> 14:01.995
She's still beautif ul, isn't she?

14:03.684 --> 14:05.595
That's the problem.

14:07.204 --> 14:09.638
-Come on.
-Let go of me!

14:09.884 --> 14:12.000
Let go of me, you pig!

14:21.564 --> 14:23.600
Don't push me!

14:34.284 --> 14:35.603
Morning, Wendy.

14:41.484 --> 14:42.803
You like?

14:44.844 --> 14:46.596
Good. Michele.

14:50.364 --> 14:53.037
For Lulu.
I think she'd like it, right?

15:01.004 --> 15:02.403
Good morning.

15:07.164 --> 15:10.315
Robert, the fan
will be on the left...

15:10.564 --> 15:12.441
...so let's get the hair on the right.

15:12.684 --> 15:16.597
Fine, there's plenty of volume here.
It's very nice hair.

15:20.684 --> 15:23.482
-Mighty tired eyes.
-I'll be all right.

15:23.684 --> 15:25.561
Everything under control?
Who wants coffee?

15:25.764 --> 15:28.597
-Tea, tea!
-Forget it. Fifteen minutes.

15:31.244 --> 15:34.395
Joey, the same colour on the nails.

15:37.764 --> 15:38.594
Joey.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.396
I'd like her mouth more f uchsia,
her eyes more intense.

15:46.644 --> 15:47.838
I'd like them to pop.

15:48.084 --> 15:51.201
I want to see the mouth
and the eyes f rom a mile away.

15:57.484 --> 16:00.760
-Bert, how's this look?
-lt's good. They're all good.

16:00.964 --> 16:03.603
-Which one are we gonna use?
-So choose.

16:03.804 --> 16:06.079
Now this one.
This one is really beautif ul.

16:06.284 --> 16:08.844
-lt's beautif ul. We'll just...
-Crop it there.

16:09.084 --> 16:11.314
That's right. I'm very pleased.

16:11.564 --> 16:14.920
These are really wonderf ul.
What are we gonna start with?

16:15.124 --> 16:17.035
Coats and lingerie.

16:17.284 --> 16:20.003
Okay, but on this one
I gotta see lace, right?

16:20.284 --> 16:21.239
Don't worry.

16:21.444 --> 16:25.437
You can do anything you want to do,
just show me the lace.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.642
-Here, check the layout.
-I don't need to, Bert.

16:28.884 --> 16:31.239
Every photographer's
got to look at layouts.

16:31.484 --> 16:33.361
She doesn't have to look at layouts.

16:33.564 --> 16:34.599
Nickey.

16:35.084 --> 16:38.394
-Move the main light lower.
-This is your idea, Laura.

16:38.644 --> 16:41.204
Don't forget why
we're shooting it this way.

16:41.444 --> 16:42.320
You want lace?

16:42.564 --> 16:45.636
Today is lace day here.
We'll have lace on Columbus.

16:45.884 --> 16:50.002
We'll have lace on the cherub.
Bert, enjoy yourself. Relax.

16:50.204 --> 16:52.195
You hired this woman,
let her do her work.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.400
She's beautif ul. Watch.

17:46.884 --> 17:50.513
God, Lulu!
You don't have to pull that hard.

17:50.844 --> 17:54.803
Girls, I love it!
Michele, Lulu, look more this way.

17:55.004 --> 17:57.393
Broader action.
Michele, see the lens.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.319
Ready?

18:43.204 --> 18:44.796
Check that.

18:55.204 --> 18:58.162
-Hey, we gonna work or what?
-What's going on?

18:58.364 --> 18:59.683
She was out late last night.

19:01.044 --> 19:02.397
You all right?

19:02.644 --> 19:06.000
Yeah. I'm just a little dizzy.
I'll be fine.

19:06.564 --> 19:08.043
All right, kill the fire.

19:08.244 --> 19:10.804
Turn off the fans.
Girls, don't mess yourselves up.

19:11.204 --> 19:14.037
Hold it together.
And just stand by, please.

19:15.484 --> 19:18.794
-What's the problem?
-I'm just trying to help!

19:19.204 --> 19:20.796
Did you have breakfast?

19:21.084 --> 19:22.403
I'm fine.

19:23.484 --> 19:24.997
Here we go. Start the fire.

19:25.204 --> 19:27.672
Everybody get in your places now.
Here we go.

19:56.284 --> 19:58.798
I have an appointment.
I'll get out here.

19:59.084 --> 20:01.393
I got nothing to do, right?
I just sit here.

20:05.804 --> 20:10.400
-Hey, come on! I ain't got all day.
-Yeah, stuff it.

21:46.564 --> 21:47.838
Let me through.

21:48.044 --> 21:50.922
-Please, let me through.
-Hey, lady, you can't go...

21:52.004 --> 21:54.802
Come on, let's go.
You gotta keep this area clear.

21:58.284 --> 22:01.003
No! I saw it! I saw it!

22:02.284 --> 22:04.798
Sal, I think we got a witness here.

22:09.844 --> 22:13.200
I'm Detective Sergeant Volpe.
You saw this happen?

22:13.484 --> 22:14.678
Yes.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.598
Did you see the perpetrator?
What'd he look like?

22:18.684 --> 22:20.834
His size, his colour?
Can you describe him?

22:21.044 --> 22:23.000
No, no. I didn't see who.

22:23.204 --> 22:24.796
What the hell did you see?

22:25.044 --> 22:27.319
I saw it happen. But I...

22:27.564 --> 22:29.202
Where were you standing?

22:30.084 --> 22:33.394
-Where were you when it happened?
-I was a few blocks away.

22:33.684 --> 22:35.197
You were a few blocks away?

22:35.404 --> 22:37.634
What did you see it with,
a telescope?

22:41.484 --> 22:42.599
Go get her.

22:44.204 --> 22:45.603
Hey, lady!

22:46.004 --> 22:47.039
Hey, lady.

22:47.244 --> 22:49.394
Hey, hold it a minute!

23:06.444 --> 23:08.400
Okay, who's next?

23:11.564 --> 23:14.237
-I feel like a hooker.
-Really.

23:26.084 --> 23:27.597
I'm bored.

23:31.044 --> 23:32.443
Tommy Ludlow?

23:32.644 --> 23:33.759
That's me.

23:36.644 --> 23:41.195
How long do we have to sit around
this pigsty before we talk to someone?

23:41.484 --> 23:42.997
Ex cuse me.

23:43.244 --> 23:45.599
I represent Laura Mars.
She called me an hour ago.

23:45.844 --> 23:47.402
-Who are you?
-Donald Phelps. I'd...

23:47.604 --> 23:50.402
Okay, Donald Phelps, sit down
and behave yourself.

23:51.084 --> 23:52.483
Pigsty.

23:55.484 --> 23:57.793
You're a pretty
important guy around here.

24:24.644 --> 24:27.841
Is this an accurate statement
of your experience?

24:29.164 --> 24:30.597
Why were you at my opening?

24:31.404 --> 24:32.996
Just getting to know you.

24:34.404 --> 24:35.803
Why am I here?

24:37.044 --> 24:39.000
I've given you a statement.

24:40.484 --> 24:42.395
You certainly have.

24:42.964 --> 24:46.195
Look, what's on those pages
is what I saw.

24:47.004 --> 24:50.440
You can see that we might be having
difficulty absorbing it...

24:50.644 --> 24:53.397
...even though
it is what you saw.

24:57.804 --> 25:01.399
I'm going to call my lawyer.
I think it's the time to do that.

25:01.684 --> 25:04.323
Or do you have
to read my rights first?

25:04.844 --> 25:07.802
Hell, no.
I didn't even f risk you yet.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.203
What about this?

25:14.804 --> 25:15.998
That's legal.

25:16.244 --> 25:18.041
Yeah, I know it's legal.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.002
Why do you carry it?

25:21.564 --> 25:23.395
Cut rope and shit.

25:24.604 --> 25:28.563
Yeah, I know.
You probably just carry it...

25:28.844 --> 25:32.200
...to protect Miss Mars'
fancy, expensive camera equipment.

25:32.804 --> 25:35.398
And maybe protect her
f rom some creeps, right?

25:35.844 --> 25:36.754
You're the man.

25:37.684 --> 25:40.596
This whole city's f ull of creeps.
Right?

25:41.684 --> 25:45.802
Guess which creep's arrest record
I have here.

25:47.484 --> 25:49.998
What I'm trying to do is give...

25:50.444 --> 25:52.912
...an account of the times
in which I'm living.

25:53.164 --> 25:55.359
I've seen all kinds of murder.

25:55.564 --> 25:59.000
Physical, yes. But moral,
spiritual, emotional murder!

25:59.444 --> 26:02.561
I can't stop it, but I can show it.

26:02.764 --> 26:05.198
I can make people look at it.

26:08.164 --> 26:10.041
That's a very moral point of view.

26:11.244 --> 26:12.518
Thank you.

26:13.764 --> 26:15.800
I've got something
I want to show you.

26:29.764 --> 26:31.197
Where did you get that?

26:31.804 --> 26:34.272
This is you on the f ront
here, isn't it?

26:37.964 --> 26:39.443
Have you ever seen...

26:39.684 --> 26:43.074
...this particular copy
of this book before?

26:49.764 --> 26:51.083
Yes. I saw it happen.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.837
With your own eyes?

26:55.244 --> 26:56.802
In a nightmare.

26:57.004 --> 26:59.598
Were you f riends with Doris Spenser?

26:59.844 --> 27:01.197
I knew her.

27:01.484 --> 27:03.202
Business acquaintances.

27:03.684 --> 27:06.198
And Miss Elaine Cassell?

27:07.284 --> 27:09.002
I knew her...

27:09.204 --> 27:10.193
...well.

27:11.884 --> 27:14.444
I am sick and tired
of waiting back there!

27:14.684 --> 27:17.403
Now I want to know
where my girlf riend is!

27:17.764 --> 27:20.801
-My father is a very...
-My father can whip your father's ass!

27:21.004 --> 27:22.403
Get him out of here.

27:26.164 --> 27:29.156
If you want real suspects,
take a look at that number...

27:29.364 --> 27:30.638
...you just dragged out.

27:30.884 --> 27:33.796
That's right.
You can tell me anything you want.

27:34.044 --> 27:36.877
Why don't you give me
a bit of that Rona Barrett?

27:38.764 --> 27:41.836
Frankly, I don't do Rona Barrett.

27:42.084 --> 27:44.234
How'd you like to see
my Barbara Walters?

27:44.484 --> 27:46.918
Hey, I do a terrific Lloyd Bridges.

27:52.484 --> 27:57.000
These are classified police
photographs of unsolved murders.

27:57.404 --> 28:00.999
They've never been
published anywhere at all.

28:02.804 --> 28:07.195
Now, what I would like you to do
is compare your photograph to ours...

28:07.804 --> 28:09.396
...in this case...

28:14.484 --> 28:16.202
...and in this case.

28:31.364 --> 28:34.834
-My question is simple...
-Why are my photos so much like yours?

28:35.084 --> 28:36.597
That's right.

28:36.884 --> 28:38.158
When were these taken?

28:38.444 --> 28:40.799
About two years ago.
This one, about 14 months.

28:43.164 --> 28:45.632
-lt's disturbing.
-Extremely.

28:45.844 --> 28:49.234
-No, the timing is disturbing.
-ln what way?

28:49.484 --> 28:52.396
You go through definite periods
in your work.

28:53.044 --> 28:55.604
About two years ago,
I began to see...

28:55.804 --> 28:58.443
...images of murder, violence.

28:58.684 --> 29:01.835
And it started to become
a part of my work.

29:02.084 --> 29:04.598
By "see, " do you mean...

29:05.644 --> 29:08.397
..."see" as you see
in your statement?

29:09.404 --> 29:12.635
No, I would just be in
the middle of doing something...

29:12.844 --> 29:15.836
...and suddenly,
images would come to me...

29:16.044 --> 29:17.796
...well, like those.

29:22.084 --> 29:24.917
You think I was in
those actual situations...

29:25.164 --> 29:29.476
...committed the murders and
then re-created them in photographs?

29:29.844 --> 29:31.800
I don't buy it.

29:56.284 --> 29:58.002
Keep it moving, please.

29:59.764 --> 30:02.278
-Get rid of him.
-I already told you once.

30:02.484 --> 30:03.280
Let's go.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.639
-How you doing, lieutenant?
-How you doing, Murph?

30:33.084 --> 30:37.794
Just send it up. Elaine Cassell
apartment. That's right. Third floor.

30:44.964 --> 30:48.400
I'd like to know if you recognize
any of these clothes.

31:08.364 --> 31:09.399
I think...

31:12.684 --> 31:14.276
...they're my husband's.

31:15.644 --> 31:16.838
Husband?

31:17.684 --> 31:20.244
Ex-husband.
We've been divorced over a year.

31:20.484 --> 31:23.396
The last I heard, he was
living in San Francisco.

31:23.604 --> 31:25.003
Well, he's back.

31:26.204 --> 31:27.398
Obviously.

31:28.404 --> 31:30.793
Was this going on
when you were married?

31:33.964 --> 31:36.956
-What's his name?
-Michael.

31:37.164 --> 31:38.597
Michael Reisler.

31:47.964 --> 31:49.363
Is this him?

31:50.604 --> 31:52.993
Is this a picture of your ex-husband?

31:55.644 --> 31:57.600
Those are very nice clothes.

31:57.964 --> 32:00.683
What does he do?
Did you buy those clothes?

32:01.084 --> 32:02.802
Michael couldn't kill anyone.

32:03.044 --> 32:05.353
Do you have any idea where he is?

32:07.284 --> 32:08.239
No idea.

32:08.884 --> 32:11.000
Are you still in love with him?

32:11.884 --> 32:13.522
-May I go home now?
-Of course.

32:13.764 --> 32:14.719
Thank you.

32:22.644 --> 32:23.918
Good evening.

32:26.644 --> 32:27.679
Good night.

32:29.644 --> 32:30.554
Good night.

32:44.444 --> 32:48.801
In case you need me, this is my number.
Call me anytime, day or night.

32:49.084 --> 32:50.403
John Neville.

32:52.564 --> 32:53.599
Thank you.

32:56.804 --> 32:58.203
Lt. Neville...

32:59.644 --> 33:01.999
Should I hire a bodyguard?

33:02.284 --> 33:03.876
You already have one.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.081
Quiet! Quiet now!

33:43.204 --> 33:44.114
Michael!

33:45.844 --> 33:48.563
What are you doing here?

33:58.884 --> 34:00.363
How did you get in?

34:01.084 --> 34:03.040
I still have a set of keys.

34:11.043 --> 34:14.480
Don't look at me like that.
I did not kill Elaine.

34:14.764 --> 34:18.040
Why would I? She was the best
meal ticket I ever had.

34:18.284 --> 34:20.672
Second best. I was the best.

34:26.643 --> 34:29.795
I was in San Francisco,
working on my novel...

34:30.404 --> 34:32.201
...and I ran into her.

34:32.563 --> 34:35.795
She convinced me to come back,
said she'd be good for me...

34:36.004 --> 34:38.279
...make it easier for me to write.

34:41.284 --> 34:42.717
I've missed you.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.312
Oh, come on.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.840
You know I only came back
to be near you.

34:51.083 --> 34:55.043
I would have called you sooner or later.
I still love you, Laura!

35:00.884 --> 35:02.397
Michael, stop it!

35:04.404 --> 35:05.962
Oh, poor Elaine.

35:07.284 --> 35:09.434
What good, good f riends.

35:09.844 --> 35:12.802
I was your husband.
I was never your f riend.

35:13.204 --> 35:14.762
But Elaine was.

35:15.644 --> 35:16.997
Why Elaine?

35:17.284 --> 35:19.639
Do you have to destroy
everything you touch?

35:19.884 --> 35:22.603
This whole thing
is pointing towards me...

35:22.844 --> 35:25.074
...and I did not do it!

35:25.284 --> 35:28.913
Everything I have is in Elaine's
apartment. I have no money, no clothes.

35:29.164 --> 35:32.554
The police are after me,
and now you provoke me!

35:33.084 --> 35:35.644
You deliberately provoke me!

35:35.844 --> 35:37.914
You may have these other
people fooled...

35:38.164 --> 35:42.999
...but I know what a killer you can
be at 3:00 in the morning.

35:44.084 --> 35:46.439
-A killer at 3:00...
-Where were you? Where?

35:46.684 --> 35:49.881
When I needed some comfort,
where were you?

35:50.084 --> 35:51.722
In your darkroom.

35:51.964 --> 35:53.602
Where else could I find peace?

35:53.844 --> 35:57.200
-You were drunk!
-You made it impossible for me to write!

35:57.404 --> 35:58.598
That's not true!

35:59.044 --> 36:01.842
You've been drunk
for the last six years!

36:02.044 --> 36:02.840
But you!

36:03.084 --> 36:06.872
Instant star of the world of chic!

36:09.764 --> 36:12.153
Will $50 be enough?

36:40.484 --> 36:45.274
I don't give a damn if everybody else
in Manhattan talks to the reporters.

36:45.484 --> 36:47.236
I don't want you talking.

36:47.444 --> 36:51.232
That guy's bullshit just won't quit.
I'd like to see him hit the streets.

36:51.484 --> 36:54.237
-I don't think he could hack it.
-I know.

36:54.484 --> 36:56.839
Hey, John, how come in that meeting...

36:57.084 --> 37:00.440
...you didn't mention anything
about that Mars chick...

37:00.684 --> 37:02.879
...seeing those things
and having dreams?

37:03.084 --> 37:04.961
You don't believe her, Sal?

37:05.164 --> 37:05.960
No.

37:19.604 --> 37:22.562
You're playing with the big boys now!
Big boys!

37:22.924 --> 37:23.720
Jesus!

37:25.604 --> 37:26.798
-Hi, darling.
-Morning.

37:27.044 --> 37:29.478
Sleep well?
What'd you find out?

37:30.084 --> 37:32.393
There's a very interesting case
of a woman...

37:32.644 --> 37:34.794
...in France who had
something similar.

37:35.004 --> 37:35.993
What happened?

37:36.244 --> 37:37.836
She died in an insane asylum.

37:38.084 --> 37:40.803
-Good morning, Miss Mars.
-Good morning, Tommy.

37:42.244 --> 37:45.236
Maybe you shouldn't talk
to anybody about this.

37:45.444 --> 37:46.763
It might just go away.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.437
Big boys!

38:03.084 --> 38:05.234
Look at that.
Is that fabulous?

38:05.964 --> 38:09.593
That's the fourth I've seen today.
They're all over the city.

38:10.364 --> 38:13.800
They'll be so famous we won't
be able to afford them anymore.

38:14.004 --> 38:15.323
You'll find a way.

38:18.204 --> 38:21.640
Miss Mars, I don't know if the cops
told you any of this...

38:21.884 --> 38:24.444
Let's talk about this some other time.

38:24.684 --> 38:28.074
Mr. Phelps here has things
he'd like to tell you about me...

38:28.284 --> 38:30.639
...but I'd rather tell you them myself.

38:30.844 --> 38:32.800
-What things?
-This isn't the time.

38:33.084 --> 38:36.713
I'm trying very hard to keep
my cards on the table...

38:38.084 --> 38:40.314
-...and myself on the street.
-Bad timing.

38:40.564 --> 38:42.282
I did a bit.

38:43.684 --> 38:46.357
I mean I've been in prison.

38:49.884 --> 38:51.033
What did you do?

38:51.884 --> 38:56.116
I was in for armed robbery
and assault with a deadly weapon.

38:56.604 --> 38:59.994
-And I have some prior arrests.
-Jesus! Spare us the soap opera.

39:00.364 --> 39:02.878
You knew that when you
hired me for Miss Mars.

39:03.124 --> 39:06.275
But what kind of deadly...
You did? You knew that?

39:06.484 --> 39:10.682
Why is that so amazing? You can't
just talk about rehabilitation.

39:10.884 --> 39:12.920
I believe in giving people a chance.

39:13.164 --> 39:16.201
You believe in spit.
And I'm not putting up with...

39:16.404 --> 39:18.315
-I'm not putting up with this...
-Wait!

39:18.644 --> 39:22.432
Five minutes ago, you sat in
this car and tried to railroad me!

39:22.884 --> 39:25.193
-Are you going to let him...
-Wait a minute!

39:25.404 --> 39:27.395
I don't want to hear anymore.

39:30.764 --> 39:33.073
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

39:33.284 --> 39:36.082
That's it.
Both of you leave me alone!

39:36.604 --> 39:37.673
" Both of you"?

39:39.244 --> 39:40.040
" Both of you."

39:40.284 --> 39:41.763
Me and your driver.

40:04.084 --> 40:07.793
I'll do some straightening up down here.
Be up in a minute.

40:12.004 --> 40:14.598
Don't forget the flowers.
They're at the regular place.

40:14.804 --> 40:16.522
-The Greek's?
-Yes.

41:02.644 --> 41:06.398
-I'm sorry if I caused you problems...
-No, Tommy, I'm sorry.

41:08.204 --> 41:11.355
It's a difficult time
for all of us...

41:11.564 --> 41:13.600
...so could we just keep
working together?

41:13.804 --> 41:17.717
-You can count on me for that.
-I can always count on you.

41:18.484 --> 41:19.883
You don't need that.

41:21.484 --> 41:22.633
Thanks, Tommy.

42:53.884 --> 42:55.033
Donald!

43:26.444 --> 43:27.479
Laura!

43:28.284 --> 43:29.239
What is it?

43:29.444 --> 43:31.435
-He's up there.
-What?

43:31.684 --> 43:33.993
-He's up there.
-Who?

43:34.204 --> 43:35.876
I saw him looking at me.

44:10.284 --> 44:13.640
Darling, I know what you're
going through. I feel for you.

44:13.884 --> 44:16.000
But there's a lot of money involved.

44:16.204 --> 44:18.513
I don't care about the money.

44:19.684 --> 44:22.994
And there is the ad agency.
They've got print dates to meet.

44:23.204 --> 44:26.674
Bert is depending on you.
Forget about the clients!

44:27.564 --> 44:31.000
Okay, you're right.
What are we, monsters?

44:31.364 --> 44:35.960
Let's wrap this thing, go home
and wait for the killer to strike again.

44:36.684 --> 44:38.003
Really, you're right.

44:38.204 --> 44:39.683
I'm sorry.

44:39.884 --> 44:41.602
I thought if you kept busy...

44:41.804 --> 44:44.921
You really know how to
manipulate me, don't you?

44:45.684 --> 44:47.197
Manipulate.

44:47.844 --> 44:50.517
" Manipulate" is just
a little bit paranoid.

44:50.764 --> 44:53.403
And to be f rank, I'm beginning
to get the message...

44:53.604 --> 44:56.198
...that you don't really
trust me anymore.

44:59.884 --> 45:02.523
Look, get them ready.
Let's shoot.

45:46.084 --> 45:48.200
Put them in the sink
and wet them down.

45:49.084 --> 45:50.517
Don't disappear.

45:52.044 --> 45:53.796
-Rita?
-Good morning.

45:55.284 --> 45:58.993
The eyes are perfect.
Keep them soft. Don't change.

45:59.844 --> 46:01.880
-Morning.
-Good morning.

46:03.844 --> 46:04.913
Anna.

46:07.684 --> 46:10.437
Cover her shoulder.
Cover it completely.

46:11.644 --> 46:12.520
John...

46:12.764 --> 46:15.198
...will I get enough height
on Anna's tail?

46:15.404 --> 46:18.999
Sure, definitely. Once I brush it,
it'll be completely f ull.

46:20.244 --> 46:22.200
Michele's eye. Cover it.

46:22.404 --> 46:24.634
Okay, I saw that. I'll do it.

46:44.644 --> 46:46.635
Perfect. Much better.

46:48.804 --> 46:50.203
I don't like the pink.

46:50.444 --> 46:52.162
Lulu, it likes you.

46:52.764 --> 46:54.038
-lt's perfect.
-Really?

46:54.284 --> 46:55.080
Really.

47:00.404 --> 47:02.918
I got this for you, man.

47:06.564 --> 47:07.917
A stolen flower.

47:09.884 --> 47:10.919
How nice.

47:52.164 --> 47:53.517
Here I am, girls.

48:10.484 --> 48:12.202
-Hi, Laura.
-Hi, Jim.

48:12.404 --> 48:14.554
You're in the pool, dead.

48:14.884 --> 48:16.795
For a hundred bucks an hour...

48:19.804 --> 48:20.600
There.

48:22.884 --> 48:25.000
You want the eyes opened or closed?

48:25.244 --> 48:26.518
Your head over.

48:27.764 --> 48:29.402
Eyes open. Wide.

48:29.644 --> 48:31.600
-Where do you want the blood?
-There.

48:35.684 --> 48:36.594
That's enough.

48:37.084 --> 48:38.233
That's enough!

48:40.364 --> 48:41.399
Here's your gun.

48:46.964 --> 48:48.158
Give it to Lulu.

48:50.444 --> 48:52.196
Here you go. Be caref ul.

49:26.644 --> 49:29.556
All right, kill the shoot.
Wrap it up. That's it.

49:29.764 --> 49:31.800
Try and pick it up tomorrow.

49:56.284 --> 49:59.435
Do you ever have any warning
when this happens to you?

49:59.684 --> 50:01.834
It terrifies me.
It could happen at any time.

50:02.084 --> 50:04.120
I find myself waiting
for it to happen.

50:04.404 --> 50:06.281
Maybe that's what does it.

50:06.484 --> 50:09.442
People who are af raid of
having an anxiety attack...

50:09.684 --> 50:11.914
...can bring one on just
by being af raid of it.

50:12.164 --> 50:13.677
It's not an anx...

50:16.044 --> 50:19.116
-You don't believe me.
-I'm trying to believe you.

50:19.364 --> 50:23.277
I've been talking to your associates.
They say you're overworked.

50:24.164 --> 50:25.392
-Overworked?
-Yeah.

50:25.604 --> 50:27.196
Overworked?

50:28.964 --> 50:31.762
Am I hallucinating all of this?

50:32.044 --> 50:35.514
Tell me it's all a dream.
Tell me that Doris is still alive.

50:35.764 --> 50:38.517
Tell me Elaine is still
happily involved with Michael.

50:39.364 --> 50:40.797
Overworked!

50:42.684 --> 50:44.402
I'm leaving now with Bert.

50:44.964 --> 50:46.283
Lock up, will you?

50:47.444 --> 50:50.038
-Tommy'll wait for you.
-That's not necessary.

50:50.244 --> 50:51.643
I'll take a taxi.

50:54.804 --> 50:55.919
I'm sorry.

50:57.764 --> 50:58.753
I'll call you.

51:10.164 --> 51:13.361
I think I can show you what I mean.

51:14.164 --> 51:15.119
About what?

51:16.044 --> 51:17.443
About what I'm seeing.

51:26.604 --> 51:27.957
Look through that.

51:28.524 --> 51:30.833
Now if you...

51:31.764 --> 51:33.959
...think of that camera...

51:34.364 --> 51:35.877
...as the eyes of the killer...

51:36.644 --> 51:41.559
...what you're seeing through that lens
is what the killer sees.

51:42.964 --> 51:45.239
It's on the monitor there.

51:46.684 --> 51:48.754
When it happens to me...

51:50.444 --> 51:52.435
...I can't see...

51:53.364 --> 51:54.797
...what's in f ront of me.

51:55.884 --> 51:57.237
What I see...

51:58.204 --> 51:59.398
...is that.

52:05.724 --> 52:07.396
Do you understand?

52:11.284 --> 52:13.115
Let me try.
It looks like f un.

52:13.364 --> 52:14.433
What?

52:16.284 --> 52:18.195
Is that how I look?
Like that?

52:18.404 --> 52:20.395
I think that's how you look.

52:21.044 --> 52:24.514
I look like a damn cop,
is what I look like.

52:26.484 --> 52:27.473
No, it's...

52:28.284 --> 52:31.833
May I ask you a few questions
about what's been happening?

52:32.084 --> 52:33.597
It makes me nervous.

52:35.644 --> 52:37.521
Why is he killing my f riends?

52:37.764 --> 52:39.880
Why is he after me? Why me?

52:40.284 --> 52:44.641
A variety of things might attract
him to you and to your associates.

52:44.884 --> 52:47.637
It could be a person
who's jealous of your success.

52:49.044 --> 52:51.842
It could be a person who,
in his own loony way...

52:52.084 --> 52:54.996
...feels your work is promoting
porno and decadence...

52:55.204 --> 52:57.798
...and he has a mission
to clean up the world.

52:58.004 --> 53:01.679
It could be a person who is outraged
about being seen in your book.

53:05.364 --> 53:06.877
Whoever it was...

53:08.004 --> 53:09.722
...was here this afternoon...

53:11.484 --> 53:13.600
...and he was looking for me.

53:16.684 --> 53:19.278
You know, I find all of this...

53:20.284 --> 53:21.797
...very interesting...

53:27.604 --> 53:30.038
I'm gonna double
the security around you.

53:30.244 --> 53:32.917
I'd advise you to stay
indoors as much as possible.

53:34.804 --> 53:35.998
Goodbye.

53:43.084 --> 53:45.598
Hey, John, you need
a little help with anything?

53:45.804 --> 53:49.513
No thank you, Officer Feeney.
I can handle these subjects alone.

53:49.724 --> 53:50.679
Thank you.

53:50.884 --> 53:53.193
Feeney, get the hell out of here!

53:55.284 --> 53:56.603
What a creep.

53:57.564 --> 54:01.398
Did either of you ever receive
a threatening or obscene phone call...

54:02.164 --> 54:04.200
...in relation to your work
with Miss Mars?

54:04.404 --> 54:05.962
I got a few letters.

54:06.204 --> 54:08.434
Did you get more than one
f rom anyone?

54:08.684 --> 54:09.514
I don't think so.

54:09.764 --> 54:12.119
Do you remember things they said?

54:12.364 --> 54:13.240
The tone?

54:13.444 --> 54:14.513
Oh, yeah.

54:14.764 --> 54:18.200
Or anything specific?
Any specific quotations?

54:20.284 --> 54:24.596
" Even though I'm so ugly
and I have pimples...

54:24.844 --> 54:29.201
I'm so ugly that you would spit at me
if I ever talked to you..."

54:29.444 --> 54:31.480
-Do I have to go on?
-I get the picture.

54:32.564 --> 54:34.077
-I kept mine.
-What?

54:34.564 --> 54:36.202
Can you bring them
so I can read them?

54:36.404 --> 54:38.122
And I can read them too?

54:38.964 --> 54:40.636
Sure. Yeah.

54:43.084 --> 54:44.119
All right.

54:44.804 --> 54:48.922
-Any more questions, officer?
-No, ma'am. This is very fine.

54:49.284 --> 54:51.195
Either one of you need a ride home?

54:51.804 --> 54:53.795
Hey, Feeney, get back in here.

54:57.164 --> 54:57.960
Taxi.

55:10.284 --> 55:13.037
-Anything doing?
-She's still up there working.

55:13.284 --> 55:15.195
-Hey, thanks.
-See you.

57:07.444 --> 57:08.433
Lulu!

57:58.284 --> 57:59.956
-This is Lulu...
-And Michele.

58:00.164 --> 58:01.961
We're not home, so go to hell!

58:02.164 --> 58:06.282
But if you're not a horny creep,
leave a message at the beep!

58:08.084 --> 58:09.642
That was so dumb!

58:19.164 --> 58:23.680
Senseless violence,
unrelenting, inex cusable...

58:23.884 --> 58:25.920
...hatef ul violence,
is once more unleashed.

58:28.684 --> 58:31.994
Each one of us has some purpose
on this earth...

58:32.204 --> 58:34.320
...some role to play...

58:34.564 --> 58:37.078
...and in the case
of Michele and Lulu...

58:37.284 --> 58:41.880
...the role that they had chosen to play
was the role of model.

58:42.884 --> 58:47.036
Now, not having met either
of these lovely young women...

58:47.284 --> 58:50.401
...but knowing that I did want
to say something...

58:50.604 --> 58:53.482
...meaningf ul about them today...

58:53.684 --> 58:58.599
...I went to my Webster's Dictionary
and I looked up the word "model."

58:59.444 --> 59:04.199
" Model: A person that serves
as an artist's pattern...

59:04.404 --> 59:08.602
...specifically a person
who poses for an artist."

59:09.004 --> 59:12.201
But beyond that, it says...

59:13.044 --> 59:16.673
..."An example for imitation."

59:18.484 --> 59:21.601
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

59:21.804 --> 59:24.841
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

59:25.084 --> 59:27.757
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

59:28.084 --> 59:29.597
He restoreth my soul.

59:30.244 --> 59:34.840
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His namesake.

59:35.164 --> 59:38.839
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

59:39.044 --> 59:43.276
...I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

59:43.484 --> 59:46.237
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

59:46.844 --> 59:51.156
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

59:51.364 --> 59:54.322
Thou anointest mine head with oil.

59:55.004 --> 59:57.199
My cup runneth over.

59:57.604 --> 01:00:02.473
Surely, goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life...

01:00:02.684 --> 01:00:05.642
...and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord...

01:00:06.204 --> 01:00:07.034
...forever.

01:00:24.404 --> 01:00:28.522
Do you intend to go on with
the violence theme in your work?

01:00:29.724 --> 01:00:30.713
I blame you.

01:00:30.964 --> 01:00:34.115
No matter who did the killing,
you're to blame.

01:00:35.364 --> 01:00:37.719
Don't walk away f rom me!

01:00:37.924 --> 01:00:39.357
You're the murderer!

01:00:39.564 --> 01:00:42.761
Because of you, she's dead.
You're gonna pay for this!

01:00:42.964 --> 01:00:45.603
You're gonna pay for this!

01:00:49.404 --> 01:00:51.713
-Where would you like to go?
-Home.

01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:54.916
Clear out of here, fellas.
Tommy, come over here.

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:58.919
I'm gonna take the lady home.
I'm dismissing the car, okay?

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:00.524
Do we have to go
right back to the city?

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:24.115
There he is. Look.

01:02:25.084 --> 01:02:26.153
It's a finch.

01:02:26.364 --> 01:02:28.320
Do you think Robert is right?

01:02:29.164 --> 01:02:31.120
Should I take this all on myself?

01:02:31.364 --> 01:02:33.161
-But I am guilty.
-No, you're not.

01:02:33.404 --> 01:02:35.235
Please listen to me very caref ully.

01:02:35.484 --> 01:02:38.317
I want you to understand
something very important.

01:02:40.564 --> 01:02:44.716
I feel that everything
I thought about you...

01:02:46.124 --> 01:02:48.240
...before I really knew you...

01:02:50.364 --> 01:02:52.514
...is not what I feel anymore.

01:03:10.964 --> 01:03:13.524
This is incredible.

01:03:14.004 --> 01:03:17.280
In the midst of all this,
I can't stop thinking of you.

01:03:17.484 --> 01:03:19.156
-I know.
-What is going on?

01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:20.553
I don't know.

01:03:20.804 --> 01:03:23.682
It's unprofessional of me
to be walking with you...

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.000
-...in the woods.
-I don't have time for this!

01:03:26.204 --> 01:03:27.842
I'm supposed to catch a killer.

01:03:28.564 --> 01:03:31.317
-I'm completely out of control!
-I know. Me too.

01:03:31.524 --> 01:03:34.322
But I can't stand being so...

01:04:10.604 --> 01:04:14.836
I can't understand
how it's possible...

01:04:21.964 --> 01:04:24.114
...to live your whole life...

01:04:25.284 --> 01:04:27.115
...without someone...

01:04:28.804 --> 01:04:31.113
...and be doing more or less okay.

01:04:36.404 --> 01:04:38.713
And then, suddenly, you find them.

01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:40.916
You recognize them.

01:04:50.684 --> 01:04:52.515
You recognize them...

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.481
...and you know without them...

01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:01.676
It's terrifying.

01:05:10.924 --> 01:05:12.323
It's beautif ul.

01:05:41.524 --> 01:05:42.923
Thank you, ma'am.

01:05:54.364 --> 01:05:56.514
There's something I want you to have.

01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:03.117
-No, I don't want that.
-Please.

01:06:04.684 --> 01:06:08.313
You've got me so well protected
that I'm a prisoner in my own house.

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:09.679
I don't need it.

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:12.523
Michele and Lulu
had police protection.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.964
-I don't know how to use it.
-I'll show you.

01:06:18.204 --> 01:06:21.162
Just put your hand on the...
That's right.

01:06:21.404 --> 01:06:25.522
Put your finger through there and
use the left hand to support the right.

01:06:25.764 --> 01:06:28.915
Push it as far away
f rom your face as you can.

01:06:29.284 --> 01:06:31.320
Look right down the barrel.

01:06:31.524 --> 01:06:34.118
And when he comes at you,
squeeze that trigger.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.916
He'll go away.

01:06:40.604 --> 01:06:41.957
I'll keep it.

01:06:42.204 --> 01:06:44.513
If you have to, use it.

01:06:45.924 --> 01:06:47.323
Promise me that.

01:06:48.484 --> 01:06:50.918
You'll be doing
the son of a bitch a favour.

01:07:24.404 --> 01:07:26.122
What's going on up there?

01:07:27.004 --> 01:07:29.723
-Her agent. It's his birthday.
-Her agent?

01:07:30.684 --> 01:07:32.117
Party time.

01:07:33.604 --> 01:07:35.117
It'll be a long night.

01:07:38.124 --> 01:07:39.523
Refill!

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.921
There she is.

01:07:50.524 --> 01:07:53.277
-I didn't know if you'd come.
-I know. Same here.

01:07:53.484 --> 01:07:54.633
Happy birthday.

01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:56.556
Come on in. Take this off.

01:07:56.764 --> 01:07:59.961
Tonight, we forget everything.
Everything, all right?

01:08:00.164 --> 01:08:02.314
-All right.
-This is great.

01:08:04.924 --> 01:08:06.243
-For you.
-Can I open it?

01:08:06.484 --> 01:08:08.395
Aunt Caroline!

01:08:09.564 --> 01:08:12.761
What's going on with you,
apart f rom this horrible business?

01:08:13.004 --> 01:08:14.722
I think I'm in love.

01:08:15.924 --> 01:08:17.562
Oh, I can't wait!

01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:20.358
Wait a minute. What is this?

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:29.560
-Look at this! When was this taken?
-When you weren't looking.

01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:32.318
I hate it! I love it.

01:08:35.363 --> 01:08:39.152
I'm sorry. Tommy, would you
come back in an hour for me?

01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:43.955
Yeah. It's just hard to figure out
what to do in just an hour.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.921
Could you work it out?

01:08:49.804 --> 01:08:52.602
-We'll save you a piece of cake.
-You're a piece of cake.

01:09:06.124 --> 01:09:08.684
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:09:08.884 --> 01:09:11.523
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:09:15.283 --> 01:09:17.559
Which nobody can deny

01:09:17.764 --> 01:09:20.517
Which nobody can deny

01:09:23.203 --> 01:09:25.513
It looks like the burning of Atlanta.

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:30.323
Don't catch that wig on fire!

01:09:37.804 --> 01:09:40.113
Happy birthday, Donald.

01:09:48.203 --> 01:09:49.523
A man.

01:09:54.604 --> 01:09:55.753
Michael?

01:09:59.684 --> 01:10:01.037
Michael, where are you?

01:10:05.364 --> 01:10:06.160
Birthday boy!

01:10:06.404 --> 01:10:09.157
You take over.
This is for the musician.

01:10:09.364 --> 01:10:11.559
Now you have 15 seconds
to gallop this up...

01:10:11.804 --> 01:10:14.762
"Gallop this up"?
Then we all play bridge.

01:10:15.564 --> 01:10:20.240
For I'm a jolly good fellow
For I'm a jolly good fellow

01:10:20.604 --> 01:10:22.481
Don't take your fingers off the keys.

01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:24.322
You gotta play too, Laura.

01:10:27.964 --> 01:10:29.716
Now who's been murdered?

01:10:30.804 --> 01:10:32.920
It's Michael.
He's...

01:10:33.284 --> 01:10:34.558
I have to go to him.

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:37.119
What do you mean,
you have to go to him?

01:10:38.404 --> 01:10:41.441
He's in a laundromat in Brooklyn.
He's drunk.

01:10:41.684 --> 01:10:43.720
He just woke up there.

01:10:44.404 --> 01:10:46.440
-He may kill himself.
-What if he kills you?

01:10:46.684 --> 01:10:48.959
He won't.
Michael will only kill Michael.

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.922
I don't agree.

01:10:52.324 --> 01:10:56.237
The night Elaine was murdered,
he came to me, terrified.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:59.157
He came to you,
he took money and he left.

01:10:59.404 --> 01:11:03.113
Yes, he took money, but he was
terrified and he needed help.

01:11:03.364 --> 01:11:05.514
I could have been kinder.

01:11:10.164 --> 01:11:11.756
Get the men downstairs
to drive you.

01:11:12.004 --> 01:11:13.722
I won't lead the police to him.

01:11:13.964 --> 01:11:15.556
It's time for bridge.

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:19.922
-Just a second, just go back...
-You keep saying that.

01:11:21.084 --> 01:11:24.520
Donald, I don't know
how to get past them. Please.

01:11:25.724 --> 01:11:26.918
Who is?

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:29.320
The lieutenant.

01:11:30.004 --> 01:11:31.915
Now he's getting into her?

01:11:32.324 --> 01:11:34.918
-That's what I hear.
-You make me laugh.

01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:39.117
Hey, it's her.

01:11:39.604 --> 01:11:41.720
Why is she going away f rom her car?

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.317
Come on, let's go.

01:12:12.764 --> 01:12:14.516
Miss Mars, wait up.

01:12:15.804 --> 01:12:18.557
Where you going?
Let us take you where you're going.

01:12:18.804 --> 01:12:21.364
What are you...?
Listen. Come on.

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.753
You're not Miss Mars!

01:12:23.004 --> 01:12:25.677
So? You're not Kojak.
What does that prove?

01:12:25.884 --> 01:12:27.283
Hey, it's him!

01:12:27.484 --> 01:12:31.159
-Why are you all dressed up like this?
-lt's my birthday.

01:12:31.404 --> 01:12:34.316
Wait a minute, you son of a bitch.
Where is she?

01:12:34.564 --> 01:12:36.316
What are you, nuts?

01:12:36.524 --> 01:12:39.118
I'm sick of this name-calling crap!

01:13:57.884 --> 01:14:00.842
The doctor asked you
to stay in the hospital.

01:14:01.084 --> 01:14:03.757
You could have at least
stayed overnight.

01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:07.553
-I'm sorry.
-You could be hurt and not even know.

01:14:07.804 --> 01:14:09.157
Please, don't.

01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:12.043
I'm fine! I'm fine.

01:14:24.804 --> 01:14:27.637
All right, I'm sorry.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:32.322
I just don't think
I could stand to lose you now.

01:14:32.524 --> 01:14:34.515
I can't stand to lose you.

01:14:41.204 --> 01:14:42.762
Time for one of these bombs.

01:14:42.964 --> 01:14:44.716
It's doctor's orders.

01:14:44.924 --> 01:14:46.994
It'll make you feel
better than worse.

01:14:47.204 --> 01:14:49.354
-I'll take one with you.
-You will not.

01:14:49.564 --> 01:14:51.122
We'll get high.

01:14:51.764 --> 01:14:54.119
-Where's your kitchen?
-There.

01:15:08.924 --> 01:15:12.121
Now take your medicine for me
like a good girl, please.

01:15:15.804 --> 01:15:16.919
Come on.

01:15:30.804 --> 01:15:32.317
Thank you.

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:41.122
I can't cry.

01:15:44.724 --> 01:15:47.113
I haven't been able
to cry for Donald.

01:15:49.204 --> 01:15:51.115
I can't cry anymore.

01:15:54.924 --> 01:15:57.154
I want to get you away f rom here.

01:15:59.964 --> 01:16:00.874
Not without you.

01:16:18.404 --> 01:16:19.723
I'll get it.

01:16:37.404 --> 01:16:39.474
I hate bothering you, John...

01:16:40.284 --> 01:16:43.321
...but I think we finally
got a break. We found...

01:16:45.964 --> 01:16:48.114
That's good.
Be right with you, Sal.

01:16:57.204 --> 01:17:00.514
-I think we have some evidence.
-What? What is it?

01:17:01.004 --> 01:17:02.960
-Still have that gun?
-ln the bedroom.

01:17:03.204 --> 01:17:04.319
Good.

01:17:04.884 --> 01:17:05.873
Why?

01:17:06.924 --> 01:17:08.516
Hang on, Laura.

01:17:09.164 --> 01:17:11.314
I think we got the son of a bitch.

01:17:12.524 --> 01:17:14.515
-Be caref ul.
-All right.

01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:25.321
Junk, junk, more junk.
Oh, God.

01:17:30.404 --> 01:17:33.316
-Look at this!
-Sorry, I'm late. Traffic.

01:17:33.564 --> 01:17:35.759
It smells like a gorilla cage in here.

01:17:36.004 --> 01:17:38.962
It started f rom the f ront door.
What's in these box es?

01:17:39.204 --> 01:17:42.958
I see nothing but pictures
and pictures and crap.

01:17:43.204 --> 01:17:45.354
-What's under the mattress?
-I looked there.

01:17:45.564 --> 01:17:47.555
Bunch of pictures.

01:17:50.484 --> 01:17:52.122
No letters, no weapons.

01:17:52.324 --> 01:17:55.316
You haven't seen anything
that looks like an ice pick?

01:18:10.204 --> 01:18:11.717
Who is this?

01:18:15.204 --> 01:18:16.523
It's for you.

01:18:22.004 --> 01:18:24.120
I wanna talk to you, man.

01:18:25.964 --> 01:18:29.593
It doesn't matter where the f uck I am.
I just wanna talk to you.

01:18:29.884 --> 01:18:32.114
You're in a lot of trouble.
You gonna come in?

01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:36.523
I know that.
I just want to talk first.

01:18:39.564 --> 01:18:43.113
Right where you are,
but I don't want any cops there.

01:18:43.604 --> 01:18:47.119
They're on their way out.
You come and see me.

01:18:50.404 --> 01:18:52.360
Okay, get everybody off the street.

01:18:52.604 --> 01:18:55.277
Find something to do for a while.
Take a hike.

01:18:55.484 --> 01:18:57.315
The man's going to come in.

01:18:57.804 --> 01:18:59.203
Okay, boss.

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:03.923
Let's go.

01:20:52.604 --> 01:20:54.720
What, you gonna arrest me now?

01:20:56.524 --> 01:20:58.196
Let's talk for a while.

01:20:58.404 --> 01:20:59.723
All right.

01:21:00.804 --> 01:21:04.922
Look, man, I mean, I was just
killing time in the basement.

01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:07.120
And it came time for me
to get Miss Mars...

01:21:07.324 --> 01:21:11.442
Wait. Start at the beginning.
Tell me what happened last night.

01:21:12.684 --> 01:21:16.120
I was down in the basement
killing time, right?

01:21:16.324 --> 01:21:19.760
And when it came time for me
to go get Miss Mars upstairs...

01:21:19.964 --> 01:21:21.955
...I went to the elevator.

01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:25.121
And then I saw...

01:21:30.404 --> 01:21:33.874
And then I remembered
that I was sneaking out...

01:21:34.084 --> 01:21:35.915
...the back door of the bar.

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.955
So I said to myself...

01:21:38.204 --> 01:21:40.115
..."What the f uck are you doing?

01:21:40.324 --> 01:21:44.317
Sneaking out the back door,
running away, f rom what?

01:21:44.564 --> 01:21:46.520
I mean, you didn't do nothing.

01:21:46.724 --> 01:21:51.275
Nobody can prove that you did nothing
because you did not do nothing."

01:21:51.884 --> 01:21:53.920
We have a problem.

01:21:56.604 --> 01:21:59.323
We found something that
we think belongs to you.

01:22:00.404 --> 01:22:02.520
It's a playing card.

01:22:03.764 --> 01:22:05.834
It's f rom your deck, I believe.

01:22:06.124 --> 01:22:08.718
And it was in the elevator
with Donald's body.

01:22:08.964 --> 01:22:10.192
It was underneath him.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.522
Do you know how it got there?

01:22:16.004 --> 01:22:20.316
Do you think whoever killed Donald
caught him in the elevator...

01:22:20.564 --> 01:22:23.522
...after you had already
gotten off in the basement?

01:22:26.564 --> 01:22:29.032
It must have been that way, man.
I don't know.

01:22:29.284 --> 01:22:32.481
All right, you're in the basement,
the elevator door opens...

01:22:32.764 --> 01:22:35.437
...there was the body.
So you took off.

01:22:36.004 --> 01:22:39.314
The next thing you know you're
sneaking out the back of a bar.

01:22:39.524 --> 01:22:40.513
What bar?

01:22:40.724 --> 01:22:42.521
Do you know what you had to drink?

01:22:43.684 --> 01:22:45.117
Do you drink a lot?

01:22:45.724 --> 01:22:47.316
Are you drunk now?

01:22:47.604 --> 01:22:50.038
-Do you know the bartender's name?
-Wait a minute!

01:22:52.404 --> 01:22:55.362
If there's any kind
of lapse in your memory...

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:59.119
...or if there's any period
of time in your life...

01:22:59.404 --> 01:23:01.440
...that you just can't remember...

01:23:02.684 --> 01:23:04.914
If there's anything
you can't remember...

01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:09.163
...it's very important
that we discover together...

01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:10.922
...what it is.

01:23:19.204 --> 01:23:22.913
You're trying to put me
in f ucking Bellevue.

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:30.234
What's going on here?
Did you arrest him yet?

01:23:30.484 --> 01:23:34.113
No, I didn't arrest him.
Take him down for observation, please.

01:23:34.364 --> 01:23:36.116
Come on, let's go.

01:23:37.364 --> 01:23:40.674
I'd rather go to the f ucking tombs
than a f ucking psych ward.

01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:42.683
Get out of here!

01:23:44.764 --> 01:23:46.720
Stop!

01:23:51.204 --> 01:23:52.637
He pulled a knife on me.

01:24:03.764 --> 01:24:05.516
Tommy, don't run!

01:24:05.764 --> 01:24:07.243
Come on, let's go.

01:24:43.404 --> 01:24:44.359
Stop!

01:24:59.004 --> 01:24:59.834
There he is!

01:25:01.444 --> 01:25:02.433
Down 49th!

01:25:07.884 --> 01:25:09.715
Pull up ahead of him.

01:25:14.124 --> 01:25:15.273
Stop!

01:25:24.764 --> 01:25:26.243
Hey, nice work!

01:25:28.284 --> 01:25:31.037
-He didn't know what he was doing.
-I saved the state 200, 000.

01:25:31.284 --> 01:25:33.115
Call a supervisor.

01:25:38.404 --> 01:25:40.122
He was sick, Sally.

01:25:44.804 --> 01:25:45.919
Sick!

01:25:50.884 --> 01:25:53.717
We got him. It's all over.
Pack your bags.

01:25:56.604 --> 01:25:59.516
It's over. Pack your bags.
I'm taking you away.

01:25:59.724 --> 01:26:01.157
All right, all right.

01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:02.717
I love you.

01:26:04.964 --> 01:26:06.522
I love you.

01:26:14.604 --> 01:26:18.313
We're being sent home now.
Anything you need before we go?

01:26:18.844 --> 01:26:19.674
No.

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:22.920
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

01:27:30.804 --> 01:27:32.123
Ex cuse me.

01:28:43.604 --> 01:28:47.119
Go away! Go away!

01:29:15.964 --> 01:29:18.159
He's in here? Who's here?

01:29:18.364 --> 01:29:20.753
He's in the elevator.
I saw him kill someone.

01:29:21.004 --> 01:29:24.155
-I saw him in the elevator.
-There's nobody in the elevator.

01:29:24.364 --> 01:29:25.513
No, I saw it.

01:29:25.724 --> 01:29:28.033
-I just got out of the elevator.
-I saw it.

01:29:28.284 --> 01:29:30.240
It's over. Tommy's dead.

01:29:30.484 --> 01:29:32.714
He's dead. Tommy's dead.

01:29:33.924 --> 01:29:35.516
Tommy's dead?

01:29:37.764 --> 01:29:39.516
I don't understand.

01:29:40.324 --> 01:29:42.633
-Why'd he kill those people?
-He hated you.

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:44.522
He hated you.

01:29:45.804 --> 01:29:47.556
-He had the idea...
-He didn't...

01:29:47.764 --> 01:29:52.360
He had an idea that your work
was glorifying violence.

01:29:52.604 --> 01:29:55.516
He had the idea that
death shouldn't be used...

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.715
...to sell things.

01:29:58.964 --> 01:30:00.238
Death...

01:30:01.204 --> 01:30:02.922
...is a sacred thing.

01:30:04.684 --> 01:30:06.515
What are you talking about?

01:30:07.284 --> 01:30:08.717
His mother.

01:30:10.604 --> 01:30:11.923
I don't understand.

01:30:12.284 --> 01:30:13.922
Tommy's mother.

01:30:14.204 --> 01:30:17.116
Hysterical woman.
She was a hooker, you know.

01:30:17.364 --> 01:30:22.119
Leave him sitting three, four days
at a time in a little one-room...

01:30:24.804 --> 01:30:26.283
...in the same pair of diapers...

01:30:26.604 --> 01:30:30.643
...while she sold her ass on the
streets of the nation's capital.

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:33.114
It wasn't very pretty.

01:30:34.364 --> 01:30:37.117
No. That's not Tommy's story.

01:30:37.364 --> 01:30:39.639
One day, the father comes home.

01:30:41.604 --> 01:30:43.515
I think it was the father.

01:30:44.284 --> 01:30:46.923
It might have been a john,
you know, a trick.

01:30:49.804 --> 01:30:53.353
Outraged about the condition of
the child, he slashes her throat...

01:30:53.564 --> 01:30:55.714
...right there on the spot.

01:30:59.804 --> 01:31:02.193
I watched the blood dry
on her face...

01:31:03.604 --> 01:31:06.516
...until it was just about
the colour of your hair.

01:31:12.284 --> 01:31:13.603
You said " I."

01:31:15.364 --> 01:31:17.958
I don't know what you see
in that son of a bitch.

01:31:18.404 --> 01:31:21.237
Can't even pay his bills.
They turned off his electricity.

01:31:21.484 --> 01:31:25.272
He cannot finish his dissertation.
He's been working on it for three years.

01:31:26.164 --> 01:31:29.122
I'm the one that keeps him in shape.
See this body?

01:31:29.364 --> 01:31:32.754
That's my work. If it was up to him,
I'd weigh 98 pounds.

01:31:33.004 --> 01:31:36.519
I'm the one that feeds him.
I pay the bills.

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:39.313
I answer the Christmas cards.

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:44.914
I'm the one you want.

01:32:27.604 --> 01:32:30.402
I love you! I love you.

01:33:42.764 --> 01:33:44.516
If you love me...

01:33:45.524 --> 01:33:46.923
...kill him.

01:33:50.164 --> 01:33:50.960
Now.

01:33:53.284 --> 01:33:54.558
Please.

01:33:58.804 --> 01:34:01.557
If you love me, you'll kill him.

01:34:07.164 --> 01:34:08.722
I love you.

01:34:16.964 --> 01:34:19.114
Please, kill him.

01:34:41.404 --> 01:34:45.522
Police operator 834.
Where is the emergency, please?

01:34:45.804 --> 01:34:47.635
I want to report a death.

01:34:47.884 --> 01:34:51.513
Ma'am, please give me
your name and address.

01:34:53.804 --> 01:34:56.113
Give me your address, please.

01:34:56.604 --> 01:34:58.640
He came here to kill me.

01:34:58.884 --> 01:35:02.433
Be calm. I'll have someone
there to help you in a moment.

01:35:02.684 --> 01:35:04.322
He couldn't do it.

01:35:05.484 --> 01:35:06.712
Ma'am?

01:35:07.084 --> 01:35:08.722
Because he...

01:35:10.084 --> 01:35:14.714
In order to help you, I have to
have your name and your address.

01:35:15.684 --> 01:35:18.198
He really did love me.

01:35:21.204 --> 01:35:23.115
Just give me your name.

01:35:23.964 --> 01:35:25.158
What?

01:35:25.964 --> 01:35:27.317
Your name.

01:35:37.924 --> 01:35:40.119
I'm Laura Mars.

01:39:04.324 --> 01:39:05.313
