00:24.125 --> 00:28.785
I.O.C. event Presentation Shanghai, China

00:41.675 --> 00:44.005
Wushu, the chinese form of martial art,

00:44.245 --> 00:46.205
should be an olympic event.

00:46.775 --> 00:48.766
It isn't about killing and vengeance,

00:48.946 --> 00:50.506
hatred and anger.

00:50.746 --> 00:51.836
Then what is wushu?

00:52.086 --> 00:55.536
In chinese, wushu means "The way of combat".

00:58.286 --> 01:00.916
Avert. Conflict.

01:01.756 --> 01:05.696
The true definition of wushu is the way to avert conflict.

01:05.996 --> 01:06.966
It's about continually

01:07.196 --> 01:08.716
seeking to better oneself.

01:08.966 --> 01:11.056
Still, it begs the question, why?

01:11.296 --> 01:12.196
Why allow wushu

01:12.596 --> 01:14.066
as an olympic event?

01:14.566 --> 01:17.466
The olympic creed stresses that the most important thing

01:17.706 --> 01:19.496
is not to win, but to take part.

01:19.736 --> 01:22.006
Just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph

01:22.246 --> 01:23.006
but the struggle.

01:23.246 --> 01:27.576
You believe this ideal embodies the spirit of wushu?

01:28.646 --> 01:33.246
Yes. The answer lies over one hundred years in the past...

01:33.646 --> 01:35.087
beginning with one man...

01:43.627 --> 01:50.187
come here.

01:56.107 --> 02:00.037
Get off if you have no money.

02:12.047 --> 02:13.747
Set off.

03:27.349 --> 03:30.149
30 years ago, Huo clan, Tianjin

04:57.761 --> 05:00.421
Young master, we must leave!

05:19.941 --> 05:20.841
Stop!

05:22.951 --> 05:24.041
How dare you!

05:24.351 --> 05:25.751
Who gave you permission to come in?

05:26.051 --> 05:28.021
I was bringing you tea.

05:28.251 --> 05:30.841
How many times have I said, you are not allowed in here!

05:35.062 --> 05:36.222
Go practice your calligraphy!

05:43.232 --> 05:44.222
Go on!

06:03.782 --> 06:06.252
I do your homework everyday.

06:06.312 --> 06:08.752
You'd be in trouble, if your father knew.

06:15.092 --> 06:16.852
Don't say anything and no one will know.

06:17.092 --> 06:19.183
I want to show you something.

06:26.573 --> 06:28.973
Jinsun! Come on!

06:29.303 --> 06:31.003
I'm coming!

06:33.003 --> 06:34.733
- Come on! - I'm coming!

06:39.313 --> 06:40.743
I'm coming!

06:53.593 --> 06:55.053
Why do you take me here?

06:55.293 --> 06:56.523
No one of other clan is allowed here.

06:56.923 --> 06:58.323
Don't worry, I'm here.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.363
Follow me

07:04.433 --> 07:06.304
Declaration of Life and Death.

07:06.534 --> 07:09.804
Every time my dad wins, he gets one of these.

07:10.044 --> 07:12.164
You see how many dad has won!

07:12.544 --> 07:15.474
But your dad is not number one in Tianjin.

07:15.874 --> 07:17.974
My father will be tomorrow.

07:18.214 --> 07:18.574
Why?

07:18.984 --> 07:21.274
Don t ask. You come with me tomorrow

07:31.124 --> 07:32.184
Today's match is between...

07:33.054 --> 07:36.424
Huo Engdi of the Huo clan...

07:37.164 --> 07:39.594
and zhao zhongqiang...

07:40.194 --> 07:43.924
of the zhao clan.

07:51.544 --> 07:53.835
Why are you two here? Looking for trouble?

07:54.075 --> 07:55.375
Your father will lose today.

07:55.615 --> 07:58.275
Our Huo wushu will beat your zhao wushu.

07:58.385 --> 07:59.365
You wait and see.

08:00.345 --> 08:02.845
My dad will let your dad have a taste of zhao's blow.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.315
The Death waiver has been signed.

08:06.885 --> 08:08.375
Win or lose, it's up to you.

08:08.995 --> 08:10.855
Live or die, it's up to god.

08:11.395 --> 08:15.525
Gentlemen, let the contest... begin!

08:39.085 --> 08:40.576
Zhaojian, now your father has tasted...

08:40.986 --> 08:42.416
the Huo wushu!

09:15.346 --> 09:17.146
The winner is...

09:17.416 --> 09:21.316
- zhao zhongqiang! - Thank you!

09:31.027 --> 09:34.397
Yuanjia...

09:35.527 --> 09:45.097
Yuanjia...

09:51.247 --> 09:52.407
Yuanjia, let's go home.

09:53.547 --> 09:57.307
Yuanjia, let's go home.

09:57.647 --> 09:59.947
Look who's here?

10:00.287 --> 10:01.247
Has the cat got your tongue?

10:01.417 --> 10:04.077
Act like a man. Don't be a wuss.

10:04.387 --> 10:05.247
Get up!

10:05.517 --> 10:06.987
Zhao, you've gone too far!

10:07.357 --> 10:08.517
You shut up!

10:09.697 --> 10:13.027
You're won'thless. Your Huo wushu is more won'thless.

10:13.297 --> 10:14.558
Fight me if you dare.

10:15.028 --> 10:17.228
Then you'll know the zhao wushu...

10:21.138 --> 10:22.038
Get up there!

10:37.748 --> 10:39.278
Yuanjia, stop!

10:43.088 --> 10:43.948
Stop!

10:57.538 --> 10:59.558
Now that you've tasted my wushu

10:59.998 --> 11:01.989
you can shut up about yours.

11:02.439 --> 11:05.569
I won, I won!

11:06.709 --> 11:09.009
Yuanjia. Get up, Yuanjia.

11:13.409 --> 11:14.279
Yuanjia, let's get out of here.

11:16.079 --> 11:17.019
I, Huo Yuanjia...

11:17.319 --> 11:19.049
swear never to be...

11:19.289 --> 11:20.449
defeated again!

11:21.589 --> 11:24.679
Jinsun, if you are my friend, please help me.

11:27.289 --> 11:29.189
Hurry up, hurry!

11:33.669 --> 11:34.629
How much longer it is going to take you?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.029
Look!

11:46.179 --> 11:46.699
Get out of here!

11:47.179 --> 11:47.799
Please help me copy it.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.270
Let's go.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.440
Oh, yes, you copy it here

11:52.510 --> 11:53.780
and take the copy home when you finish.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.010
My dad will beat me

11:55.250 --> 11:57.620
if he sees it.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.820
- Come back as soon as you can! - I will!

12:04.560 --> 12:06.290
Be very careful when you copy the last page

12:06.530 --> 12:08.550
on the Exterminating Blow, would you?

12:13.260 --> 12:15.250
Young master, why are you in the master's library?

12:16.070 --> 12:17.560
Are you beaten?

12:17.700 --> 12:21.230
Hurry, the master wants you. Come on.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.160
Are you ok?

12:31.110 --> 12:31.700
Kneel down!

12:35.380 --> 12:37.281
You are fighting again!

12:38.421 --> 12:41.681
I ask you to study, but all you do is make trouble outside.

12:42.721 --> 12:43.521
Laifu,

12:44.791 --> 12:47.261
- bring the rod! - Yes.

12:53.231 --> 12:57.631
Look how he is bruised. There is no rush to punish him.

12:59.871 --> 13:00.771
Master.

13:03.541 --> 13:04.631
- Laifu, - Yes, Madam.

13:04.711 --> 13:05.731
Take the young master back to his room.

13:07.381 --> 13:10.541
Copy confucius' The Analects ten times and give it to me before dinner.

13:10.751 --> 13:12.581
- Do you understand? - Yes.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.452
Let me put some medicine on it.

13:25.132 --> 13:27.592
Lai. You may leave.

13:28.232 --> 13:28.822
Yes.

13:36.302 --> 13:38.562
Why are you upset?

13:38.802 --> 13:40.862
Mother, why doesn't father teach me wushu?

13:42.742 --> 13:44.572
Because he cares about you.

13:45.512 --> 13:46.772
You have asthma.

13:47.182 --> 13:49.512
The training is too much for you.

13:49.812 --> 13:51.902
But it can make me strong.

13:53.852 --> 13:57.182
You want to learn just to be strong?

13:57.892 --> 13:59.582
When I'm good enough, I'll take revenge.

13:59.652 --> 14:02.322
I want zhao to fear our Huo wushu.

14:08.532 --> 14:09.462
My child,

14:10.433 --> 14:13.923
wu Shu is not about winning.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.873
It's about discipline and self-restraint.

14:17.503 --> 14:21.343
One practices wushu...

14:21.943 --> 14:24.463
for...

14:24.743 --> 14:25.733
inner strength...

14:26.313 --> 14:27.673
and to help...

14:27.743 --> 14:29.803
the weak.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.413
Wushu...

14:33.683 --> 14:37.213
is not for revenge.

14:37.523 --> 14:39.653
Respect must be earned.

14:39.723 --> 14:41.883
If I'm really good, everyone will fear me.

14:43.493 --> 14:44.483
Fear and respect...

14:44.793 --> 14:47.453
are not the same.

14:49.463 --> 14:52.293
Now do your penance.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.503
Don't make your father angry.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.384
Have you finished your calligraphy?

15:14.624 --> 15:15.604
Soon.

15:16.224 --> 15:17.914
- How come you do it so slow? - Don't bother.

15:18.324 --> 15:19.254
I'm not going to do it if you keep bothering me.

15:19.494 --> 15:21.924
Ok, I'm going to bother you. Hurry up.

16:10.865 --> 16:11.765
You dare to sign?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.565
Thank you for preparing all this.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.235
This is also what I want to do.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.305
After you, sir!

16:36.426 --> 16:38.286
You win...

16:40.526 --> 16:40.996
Now you have your revenge

16:41.396 --> 16:43.366
and can study well, right?

16:49.396 --> 16:50.666
Your zhao's kung fu is nothing but bungling oafishness.

16:50.906 --> 16:53.806
Today you have a taste of our Huo's kung fu.

16:53.876 --> 16:56.736
Remember, never brag about zhao's kung fu again.

16:59.046 --> 17:00.376
Let me help you, zhaojian.

17:00.606 --> 17:01.666
Get away!

17:01.916 --> 17:08.316
I won!

17:17.756 --> 17:19.527
I won!

17:19.857 --> 17:21.587
Fly... fly... fly...

17:22.896 --> 17:25.416
- You're falling down, falling... - I'm not falling.

17:25.797 --> 17:28.927
- You're falling down, falling... - I'm not falling.

17:29.337 --> 17:30.827
Then father knocks you down...

17:32.537 --> 17:37.307
I'm not falling down.

17:46.347 --> 17:47.547
Be careful with her.

17:52.417 --> 17:53.357
Good morning, Mother.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.597
You didn't take your medicine again.

17:58.897 --> 18:01.727
Mother, since I began training,

18:01.967 --> 18:03.687
my asthma has gone.

18:06.437 --> 18:07.598
Look at your daughter.

18:07.868 --> 18:10.898
You've spoiled her since her mother died.

18:11.938 --> 18:13.838
Your daughter needs a mother.

18:13.908 --> 18:16.638
You should marry again.

18:17.978 --> 18:21.848
Mother, I'm too busy building up the family reputation.

18:22.078 --> 18:24.878
Soon everyone in Tianjin will respect the Huo name.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.048
There's no time for marriage.

18:28.848 --> 18:30.078
Father, I want to go see you fight.

18:30.488 --> 18:33.818
All these years, you haven't lost.

18:34.688 --> 18:37.418
Your most formidable enemy...

18:38.028 --> 18:39.828
lies...

18:40.398 --> 18:42.518
within you.

18:42.968 --> 18:44.398
Oh, I get it.

18:50.838 --> 18:51.738
Young master...

18:53.208 --> 18:54.569
oh, yes.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.509
Mother, why not go take a rest?

19:05.849 --> 19:06.649
Father,

19:07.089 --> 19:09.019
your fist wasrt fast enough...

19:09.659 --> 19:10.879
and your heart wasrt hard enough.

19:11.459 --> 19:13.519
Rest assured, as long as I live,

19:14.029 --> 19:16.959
the Huo family will never lose again.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.929
I'll be the champion of Tianjin.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.139
Father!

19:35.909 --> 19:36.879
Jade!

19:40.009 --> 19:41.640
- For me? - No.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.510
- Please! - No.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.180
When do I get it?

19:46.750 --> 19:48.980
When you win.

19:49.190 --> 19:50.620
- Really! - Yes.

19:51.020 --> 19:51.890
Promise?

19:55.660 --> 19:58.630
Tianjin 1900

20:05.940 --> 20:07.600
Master, you always win.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.170
Master Huo. When you will be the champion of the world?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.000
I don't know. What do you think?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.780
Today! It'll be today!

20:40.861 --> 20:41.961
Hi, zhao!

20:42.231 --> 20:43.961
Where have you been hiding all these years?

20:44.171 --> 20:47.801
I've fought in 38 cities in 17 provinces.

20:48.011 --> 20:49.561
My skills are so good...

20:49.811 --> 20:51.171
that I remain undefeated.

20:53.011 --> 20:53.841
Bullshit!

20:54.081 --> 20:55.101
You're bullshit!

20:55.981 --> 20:57.771
The Death waiver has been signed.

20:58.011 --> 21:00.711
Let the contest begins!

21:10.191 --> 21:11.951
Come! Come on up!

21:21.072 --> 21:24.092
What's the matter? Scared?

21:24.332 --> 21:26.032
Afraid you'll fall and hurt yourself?

21:26.272 --> 21:27.102
In your dreams!

21:39.052 --> 21:40.312
Great! Master!

22:45.873 --> 22:48.743
I am unyielding like a mountain. My legs - the firm bedrock.

22:48.973 --> 22:50.914
Today, Huo wushu becomes history.

22:51.174 --> 22:53.164
Fine! You'll have your chance...

22:53.814 --> 22:54.614
to lose!

23:26.374 --> 23:28.174
- Cat's paw? - Tiger's claw!

23:45.695 --> 23:46.245
Give up!

23:51.925 --> 23:53.125
Great!

23:54.995 --> 23:56.125
You think you'd win so easily?

23:56.365 --> 23:58.335
- Cat's paw! - Tiger's claw!

24:18.315 --> 24:19.285
You've lost!

24:30.726 --> 24:31.756
Be careful!

24:40.076 --> 24:41.126
Master!

24:41.876 --> 24:43.306
- Are you oK? - I'm fine!

24:44.306 --> 24:45.736
So, you're still alive!

24:49.716 --> 24:50.806
- Don't touch me! - Master!

24:51.046 --> 24:52.066
The winner is...

24:52.316 --> 24:53.286
Huo Yuanjia!

24:56.046 --> 24:59.676
Thank you. Thank you.

25:02.226 --> 25:03.316
Thank you. Thank you.

25:31.117 --> 25:32.167
Master,

25:32.377 --> 25:33.977
Thank you.

25:34.217 --> 25:36.807
Congratulations!

25:37.357 --> 25:38.287
Thank you.

25:40.087 --> 25:41.217
This way please, Master Huo.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.817
Thank you.

25:43.057 --> 25:45.187
- Yuanjia! - Hey, Jinsun!

25:47.397 --> 25:48.457
You've just arrived?

25:49.167 --> 25:50.187
Your usual table is ready.

25:51.427 --> 25:57.527
Congratulations!

25:58.407 --> 26:01.238
Thanks, thanks.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.728
Come on! Drink up!

26:07.048 --> 26:08.978
Jinsun, your restaurant is...

26:09.278 --> 26:10.868
more popular than ever.

26:11.118 --> 26:13.478
Thanks to all my friends, it's getting by.

26:14.248 --> 26:15.338
When we were young...

26:16.088 --> 26:17.378
you were such a nerd!

26:17.788 --> 26:20.118
Who could imagine you'd become such a great business man?

26:20.388 --> 26:23.358
No one will pay me to read books all day.

26:23.588 --> 26:24.248
But being a businessman?

26:24.488 --> 26:26.288
It's a living.

26:27.428 --> 26:29.228
Yuanjia, you must try these.

26:29.498 --> 26:32.468
I've recruited the best chefs... from across the country.

26:32.868 --> 26:34.228
Have a taste. Tell me what you think.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.128
Come, come, eat!

26:36.468 --> 26:38.558
Master, after you.

26:44.038 --> 26:45.838
- I'm xia xiang. - I'm xu DaShan.

26:46.149 --> 26:48.409
Please take us as your disciples we want to learn Huo wushu...

26:48.819 --> 26:50.779
and we'll devote ourselves to you!

26:51.889 --> 26:53.879
Good! You look tough enough.

26:54.189 --> 26:55.079
Give them drinks!

26:57.419 --> 26:59.009
Bottoms up and we'll all be brothers.

26:59.259 --> 27:00.249
Cheers!

27:01.329 --> 27:03.119
Master Huo, congratulations!

27:03.359 --> 27:04.259
Thanks, master.

27:07.099 --> 27:08.159
Today is ajoyous occasion.

27:08.399 --> 27:10.369
Everything's on me!

27:11.569 --> 27:12.429
Enjoy!

27:13.099 --> 27:14.399
Have a seat!

27:15.369 --> 27:17.269
Come, come, eat!

27:21.109 --> 27:22.129
Jade!

27:22.539 --> 27:25.479
It's time for bed.

27:25.879 --> 27:27.969
Go tuck her in.

27:33.049 --> 27:35.080
Miss, it's time for bed.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.380
Be a good girl, come on.

27:37.460 --> 27:40.420
It's bed time. Come on...

27:57.970 --> 27:59.300
what's this? It tastes horrible!

27:59.570 --> 28:01.060
It's called "coffee."

28:01.440 --> 28:03.430
A western thing. Not used to it, are you?

28:04.380 --> 28:06.940
These are turbulent times.

28:07.350 --> 28:08.510
Our country has grown weak.

28:08.910 --> 28:11.350
The west is dominating us.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.110
People like me must not...

28:13.350 --> 28:14.610
be concerned only with money.

28:15.290 --> 28:16.350
People like you should not...

28:16.920 --> 28:18.650
be concerned only with fighting.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.351
Our country deserves better.

28:21.191 --> 28:24.181
Politics is for intellectuals.

28:24.631 --> 28:27.261
I'm just a fighter. To be the champion of Tianjin is all I care about.

28:28.001 --> 28:30.121
It's that important to you?

28:32.031 --> 28:34.301
Come, let me show you something.

28:34.701 --> 28:35.671
Jinsun,

28:36.271 --> 28:38.431
you've only... watched a fight from below.

28:38.671 --> 28:41.541
Now you're standing up right here. Do you feel the difference?

28:42.581 --> 28:43.981
What difference?

28:46.951 --> 28:48.311
When you are down there...

28:49.221 --> 28:51.111
life and death up here has nothing to do with you.

28:51.581 --> 28:53.311
It's all entertainment.

28:53.951 --> 28:55.211
But when you are up here...

28:55.521 --> 28:57.391
you must not lose. You have to win!

28:58.291 --> 29:00.261
But you can choose not to be here.

29:04.401 --> 29:05.921
Jinsun, listen!

29:09.332 --> 29:10.392
To what?

29:11.432 --> 29:12.902
I don't hear anything.

29:17.472 --> 29:18.632
I can hear you...

29:19.942 --> 29:22.032
Master Huo, you're our hero!

29:24.612 --> 29:28.512
Great! That's great!

29:28.582 --> 29:30.342
Master is the champion of the world.

29:56.343 --> 29:58.033
Iron head kungfu!

30:26.233 --> 30:27.163
Thanks a lot.

30:29.103 --> 30:31.573
That's great!

30:31.733 --> 30:33.173
Hey! This is taking too long.

30:33.473 --> 30:35.663
Get everyone who has signed a waiver to come up all at once.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.273
All you challengers,

30:38.513 --> 30:39.603
get up there!

31:31.125 --> 31:32.085
Huo Yuanjia,

31:32.325 --> 31:34.585
when will you be the champion of Tianjin?

31:34.825 --> 31:36.055
What do you think?

31:36.595 --> 31:39.495
Today! It'll be today!

31:56.815 --> 31:58.645
Let's eat.

31:59.075 --> 31:59.635
Yes, Madam.

32:02.115 --> 32:03.085
You must be hungry.

32:04.685 --> 32:07.555
Here, eat some of this.

32:16.365 --> 32:19.226
What's the matter?

32:22.236 --> 32:24.796
We seek to be your disciples...

32:25.206 --> 32:26.366
and devote ourselves to you.

32:27.506 --> 32:29.496
Fine! You may join.

32:29.576 --> 32:30.766
Come on. Give them drinks! A round for everyone.

32:36.446 --> 32:39.346
Bottoms up and we'll all be brothers!

32:39.846 --> 32:41.546
Come on, come on.

32:42.146 --> 32:43.586
- Come on, come on. - Master Huo...

32:43.816 --> 32:46.576
Master Huo, congratulations! You're the true champion of Tianjin!

32:49.356 --> 32:50.586
See you. Have a good day.

32:50.656 --> 32:54.216
Come on, you're not drinking?

32:54.796 --> 32:57.486
Master Huo's bills are long overdue.

33:00.266 --> 33:01.326
Alright. Alright.

33:03.466 --> 33:05.627
A toast!

33:09.807 --> 33:10.567
Bring a biggerjug!

33:10.807 --> 33:12.607
Hey, you're not drinking? Now You must drink two more!

33:13.377 --> 33:15.307
You have not fought my godfather Master chin.

33:19.647 --> 33:21.137
Come on...

33:22.247 --> 33:22.777
Yuanjia...

33:23.187 --> 33:24.647
You've won 38 contests in a row,

33:24.887 --> 33:26.247
and defeated every fighter in Tianjin.

33:26.487 --> 33:27.887
There's no one left.

33:30.687 --> 33:31.747
No, you're wrong.

33:32.857 --> 33:34.227
There is still one left to beat.

33:35.767 --> 33:37.487
So you are not going to stop?

33:41.637 --> 33:44.727
I want to be the true champion of Tianjin. I must fight.

33:45.737 --> 33:47.297
What about elsewhere?

33:47.637 --> 33:50.667
Beijing, Guangdong, Hunan?

33:51.708 --> 33:53.738
When will you stop?

33:55.318 --> 33:57.748
I know what you're saying.

33:58.378 --> 33:59.348
But I cannot stop now.

33:59.578 --> 34:00.738
I need to prove that

34:01.348 --> 34:03.648
I am the best... the strongest.

34:03.888 --> 34:06.718
For what? You will always be you.

34:06.958 --> 34:08.748
You'll never become someone else!

34:09.358 --> 34:10.447
Yuanjia

34:10.788 --> 34:13.558
I think you should take a break and reconsider.

34:13.757 --> 34:14.748
What's this?

34:18.328 --> 34:20.598
These...

34:20.668 --> 34:22.467
are your bills.

34:23.808 --> 34:24.967
I'll take care of it.

34:26.668 --> 34:28.898
All your so-called disciples, only come

34:29.578 --> 34:31.628
for the free drinks and food.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.648
You don't understand our circle.

34:34.878 --> 34:36.368
Our circle...

34:37.777 --> 34:38.879
Fine.

34:39.389 --> 34:41.748
I will settle the bills tomorrow.

34:42.489 --> 34:43.579
Yuanjia,

34:43.688 --> 34:45.679
I am not here for your money

34:45.958 --> 34:47.789
I only want to remind you

34:48.429 --> 34:49.819
Please be careful with the people...

34:50.228 --> 34:52.688
in your inner circle.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.349
Judge them by their integrity, not their drinking.

35:11.409 --> 35:11.969
Good morning,

35:12.379 --> 35:13.709
Good morning, Master Huo!

35:13.779 --> 35:16.309
Good morning, Master Huo!

35:16.549 --> 35:19.519
- Good morning, Master chin! - Good morning

35:28.060 --> 35:29.790
what a coincidence

35:29.860 --> 35:31.720
to run into the...

35:32.260 --> 35:33.520
self-proclaimed champion of Tianjin!

35:33.800 --> 35:36.420
Master chin, it's been a long time.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.870
At your age...

35:39.270 --> 35:40.530
I thought you'd retired.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.000
Too many disciples.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.770
I cannot retire even if I wanted to.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.310
Oh! Is that so?

35:49.740 --> 35:51.540
Then this big coffin is a gift to yourself?

35:51.840 --> 35:52.780
Enjoy it soon!

35:54.850 --> 35:55.810
You're too kind.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.510
Actually, this is my gift to you!

36:03.590 --> 36:06.780
Your master needs help!

36:08.860 --> 36:11.330
Master chin, this way please!

36:28.741 --> 36:29.771
Stop!

36:31.711 --> 36:34.871
If you want to learn wushu, you need to work hard at it.

36:37.351 --> 36:39.871
Work hard?

36:43.461 --> 36:47.481
The perfecting of skills needs time and determination.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.721
Tell me... Stand off!

36:49.791 --> 36:50.591
Stand off!

36:50.831 --> 36:51.821
Stand off!

36:53.431 --> 36:55.521
Give it two or three years, and you will only have some superficial knowledge.

36:59.702 --> 37:01.292
Well, this is twenty year's practice.

37:01.602 --> 37:02.762
Can you handle this?

37:03.772 --> 37:04.802
Go on!

37:10.342 --> 37:11.332
Young master,

37:11.912 --> 37:13.402
the income of the wushu school...

37:13.652 --> 37:15.112
barely covers the household overhead.

37:15.682 --> 37:18.452
Your disciples have incurred

37:18.682 --> 37:20.052
a large expense.

37:22.922 --> 37:24.412
What about the household reserve?

37:24.962 --> 37:27.792
It's been depleted three months ago.

37:28.632 --> 37:31.792
Depleted? Depleted.

37:33.862 --> 37:36.132
Master! Master!

37:38.632 --> 37:41.362
How many times have I told you to hone your skills.

37:41.642 --> 37:42.572
No one listens.

37:44.972 --> 37:45.842
Who did this?

37:47.043 --> 37:48.343
Master chin!

37:53.383 --> 37:54.543
Master.

38:02.453 --> 38:03.513
Master.

38:08.633 --> 38:13.823
We celebrate Master chirs birthday.

38:14.103 --> 38:17.863
Wishing him good fortune.

38:17.933 --> 38:18.873
Terrific!

38:20.703 --> 38:21.503
Godfather!

38:21.943 --> 38:23.903
We wish you good fortune...

38:24.413 --> 38:25.773
and great health.

38:36.854 --> 38:39.684
Wish you a prolong life.

38:39.924 --> 38:41.114
Great! Great!

38:46.564 --> 38:47.154
Master Huo,

38:47.824 --> 38:49.194
today's my godfather's birthday.

38:49.934 --> 38:51.024
These tables are reserved.

38:51.834 --> 38:54.194
As a favor to me, please drink somewhere else.

38:56.104 --> 38:57.164
Master Huo, please do me a favor...

38:59.104 --> 39:00.504
You don't qualify to speak to me.

39:04.774 --> 39:05.744
Hey!

39:06.174 --> 39:07.974
I'm not in the mood to fight...

39:08.584 --> 39:09.944
on my birthday.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.674
Maybe some other time.

39:16.124 --> 39:18.884
You injured my disciple.

39:19.224 --> 39:20.884
You should be ashamed of yourself.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.995
I'm here to settle the score.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.455
What do you want?

39:29.195 --> 39:31.865
It's signed. Do you have the guts to sign it too?

39:31.935 --> 39:34.955
Otherwise, get on your knees and apologize.

39:36.535 --> 39:37.905
Yuanjia!

39:40.645 --> 39:41.605
You've crossed the line. Don't be...

39:41.845 --> 39:42.505
so rude in front of his guests.

39:42.745 --> 39:44.765
If you've got a problem, let's talk tomorrow.

39:44.975 --> 39:47.915
My disciple's hurt. I must do something.

39:48.545 --> 39:49.535
I don't care what happened,

39:49.785 --> 39:52.545
But you mustrt spoil their celebration.

39:56.255 --> 39:57.915
I'm not here to spoil anything.

39:57.985 --> 39:58.785
Yuanjia!

39:59.025 --> 40:00.785
You think I might trash your place.

40:01.025 --> 40:03.215
I'll pay all damages to the last penny!

40:08.035 --> 40:11.226
How can you talk like this?

40:12.636 --> 40:13.866
You should go.

40:14.106 --> 40:16.266
Forget that we've ever been friends!

40:19.076 --> 40:20.836
You're asking me to leave?

40:23.246 --> 40:25.036
You're willing to throw away...

40:25.916 --> 40:27.576
our friendship?

40:29.786 --> 40:31.216
Everybody out!

40:32.286 --> 40:34.046
My sword seeks vengeance!

40:37.726 --> 40:39.056
Stay at your own peril!

45:38.212 --> 45:39.273
Master! Master!

45:39.513 --> 45:43.213
The Master has won!

45:43.453 --> 45:46.973
Let's drink!

47:08.454 --> 47:09.354
Master Huo.

47:12.494 --> 47:13.965
Congratulations!

47:14.965 --> 47:15.955
You got your wish.

47:16.195 --> 47:17.855
You're finally the champion of Tianjin.

47:18.865 --> 47:20.195
You might like to know...

47:20.935 --> 47:23.965
Master chin died two hours ago.

47:40.455 --> 47:41.855
Huo Yuanjia!

47:44.155 --> 47:47.245
When will you be the champion?

47:50.355 --> 47:52.025
It'll be today!

47:52.265 --> 47:54.095
It'll be today!

47:54.965 --> 47:56.085
Huo Yuanjia!

47:56.465 --> 47:58.195
It'll be today!

47:59.235 --> 48:01.066
It'll be today!

48:01.966 --> 48:03.026
Huo Yuanjia!

48:03.276 --> 48:06.366
Champion of Tianjin! Today is the day!

50:26.459 --> 50:27.449
Yes, I killed your family!

50:28.659 --> 50:30.259
I am responsible.

50:32.169 --> 50:34.069
Godmother, take good care.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.540
Tell the Master the truth.

51:25.610 --> 51:26.630
Master,

51:27.680 --> 51:28.650
it's all my fault.

51:29.410 --> 51:30.510
I'm very sorry.

51:31.580 --> 51:33.240
I was drunk...

51:33.620 --> 51:36.610
I insulted Master chirs wife.

51:37.890 --> 51:40.250
He was teaching me a lesson.

51:44.830 --> 51:47.490
All the brothers knew,

51:47.560 --> 51:50.190
but nobody told you.

51:51.400 --> 51:55.700
Master... Master!

51:57.301 --> 52:00.531
Master.

54:38.604 --> 54:43.404
Come along, Yuenjia.

54:57.724 --> 54:59.714
He is burning up.

55:00.264 --> 55:01.024
Let me make some herbal medicine.

55:01.424 --> 55:03.984
He'll feel better.

55:35.495 --> 55:38.555
Drink, my dear. You'll feel better afterwards.

56:45.947 --> 56:47.047
You woke up.

56:49.687 --> 56:51.017
I will bring you some warm congee.

57:14.777 --> 57:16.337
He's awake, Grandma.

57:16.577 --> 57:17.507
That's good.

57:24.517 --> 57:28.458
Leave it. He's going to sleep. Let's go

57:29.118 --> 57:32.058
Go.

57:32.458 --> 57:34.688
He's going to sleep. Go.

58:40.949 --> 58:41.939
It's time for lunch.

58:54.259 --> 58:55.989
When I was 13...

58:56.259 --> 58:57.919
my eyesight began to fail.

58:58.999 --> 59:01.930
Everything turned blurry.

59:02.700 --> 59:04.030
I cried a lot.

59:05.740 --> 59:06.970
My Grandma told me...

59:08.010 --> 59:10.440
cry if you are sad.

59:10.910 --> 59:12.900
When there are no more tears, life will go on.

59:15.180 --> 59:17.940
I can see everything in my heart.

59:18.050 --> 59:19.140
Do you believe me?

59:38.970 --> 59:40.660
I'll wash your hair.

01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:28.031
Your hair will get knotted...

01:00:28.711 --> 01:00:30.231
if you don't wash it often.

01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:36.882
Grandma always says...

01:00:37.752 --> 01:00:39.812
cleanliness brings purity to life.

01:00:41.082 --> 01:00:42.912
Every knot can be untangled.

01:00:59.672 --> 01:01:01.292
Huang, you've been through It's not easy, is it?

01:01:01.932 --> 01:01:04.162
So many years with us.

01:01:06.302 --> 01:01:10.142
Grandma, Huang doesn't seem to be alright

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:14.242
Everyone has this day.

01:01:14.982 --> 01:01:18.072
It's time for Huang to rest.

01:01:20.382 --> 01:01:23.222
What about him? He also needs to rest?

01:01:24.153 --> 01:01:27.993
He needs a long sleep.

01:01:28.193 --> 01:01:32.653
When he wakes up, he will know what to do.

01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:39.103
I found this in your clothes.

01:01:46.043 --> 01:01:47.943
Let's go and let Huang rest.

01:02:56.264 --> 01:02:57.164
Ox!

01:02:58.135 --> 01:02:59.335
You sleep a lot!

01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:01.725
You slept as much as our ox...

01:03:01.975 --> 01:03:03.305
that's why we call you ox.

01:03:03.775 --> 01:03:05.365
Come this way.

01:03:11.745 --> 01:03:13.845
Ox, you've waken up?

01:03:15.955 --> 01:03:17.915
Let's catch some dragonflies. Let's go!

01:03:20.185 --> 01:03:22.155
Let's catch some dragonflies.

01:05:02.377 --> 01:05:03.937
Let's go, Huang.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.377
Huang, let's go home.

01:05:12.547 --> 01:05:13.887
Come on, Grandma here

01:05:15.257 --> 01:05:18.117
Huang, no need to come to the field today. You can rest.

01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:21.118
Grandma knows you have tried your best.

01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:25.558
Come, come with Grandma.

01:05:27.198 --> 01:05:28.188
Ok.

01:05:31.538 --> 01:05:33.128
Huang, come with me.

01:05:36.138 --> 01:05:37.328
Huang is used to coming

01:05:37.838 --> 01:05:39.868
to the field everyday to work.

01:05:40.108 --> 01:05:41.268
It's so endurant and hard-working

01:05:43.908 --> 01:05:45.348
Now it knows that it wouldn't live very long

01:05:46.018 --> 01:05:49.278
and yet it still wants to help.

01:05:50.448 --> 01:05:52.178
It has done so much for us

01:05:53.118 --> 01:05:55.048
and never asked anything in return.

01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:54.370
Eat something, my dear. Everything will pass. Eat something.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.540
The men in the city go to the exam.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:11.980
They will grow if they succeed in the exam.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.350
Eat something.

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:15.480
Eat more.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:21.250
Tomorrow, you should take him...

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.860
to work in the fields.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.030
He'll feel better.

01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:23.171
Ox...

01:08:52.772 --> 01:08:56.072
ox... ox... come...

01:08:56.482 --> 01:08:59.171
come, quick.

01:09:00.982 --> 01:09:03.312
Look! Moon told me not to say anything.

01:09:03.582 --> 01:09:05.212
You did a bad job.

01:09:05.452 --> 01:09:07.182
She is re-planting for you.

01:09:26.633 --> 01:09:28.193
Seedlings are alive.

01:09:28.573 --> 01:09:30.433
If you plant them too close together...

01:09:31.203 --> 01:09:32.533
they will not grow.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:34.563
Just like people...

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.042
they need to respect each other...

01:09:37.513 --> 01:09:39.412
in order to live together peacefully.

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:43.513
I'll always remember.

01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:42.834
I want my Huang...

01:10:43.074 --> 01:10:45.594
I want my Huang... I won't let it go.

01:10:45.844 --> 01:10:47.834
I want my Huang...

01:10:48.074 --> 01:10:51.775
I want my Huang... I won't let it go.

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:56.105
Gui...

01:11:00.185 --> 01:11:04.785
Gui, you are too young to understand.

01:11:05.195 --> 01:11:07.385
Huang leaves this world in peace,

01:11:08.025 --> 01:11:10.965
since he had done what he needed to do.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.955
Everyone dies,

01:11:14.155 --> 01:11:15.775
So does Huang.

01:11:16.025 --> 01:11:19.925
But one only leaves in peace

01:11:20.225 --> 01:11:23.665
when there is no regret in one's life.

01:11:23.895 --> 01:11:26.155
Don't cry, my boy.

01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:05.836
Gui has a problem!

01:12:08.076 --> 01:12:09.066
What happened to him?

01:12:10.346 --> 01:12:11.606
He missed his bull so much

01:12:11.876 --> 01:12:14.106
that he stole one from the Siam clan.

01:12:14.186 --> 01:12:15.586
He got caught over there

01:12:17.086 --> 01:12:20.176
and they are about to punish him according to their law.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:24.887
Let's go to save Gui!

01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:37.667
Help me...

01:12:39.207 --> 01:12:40.077
Help me...

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:41.167
Beat him.

01:12:46.147 --> 01:12:48.017
Help me...

01:12:49.687 --> 01:12:51.047
help me...

01:12:53.627 --> 01:12:55.817
Help me...

01:12:56.697 --> 01:12:58.927
Are you coming for a fight?

01:12:59.197 --> 01:13:02.657
Gui made a mistake and should be punished.

01:13:03.067 --> 01:13:05.127
You have already punished him enough.

01:13:05.367 --> 01:13:10.107
I'm here to make a formal apology.

01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:14.848
The boy doesn't know any better.

01:13:15.118 --> 01:13:17.948
Let us take him back.

01:13:18.118 --> 01:13:21.988
Indeed he is a child.

01:13:22.188 --> 01:13:23.378
But even for children in our village,

01:13:23.788 --> 01:13:26.918
we beat them for the burning time of an incense

01:13:27.928 --> 01:13:30.288
so they will remember the lesson.

01:13:30.728 --> 01:13:31.788
Go on. Beat him.

01:13:36.338 --> 01:13:37.328
Help me!

01:13:37.738 --> 01:13:40.258
The child can't take it. Let me take the beating for him!

01:13:41.938 --> 01:13:43.028
Stop!

01:13:53.418 --> 01:13:55.118
Let me take the beatings for Gui.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.089
Well, this punishment is for children.

01:14:05.699 --> 01:14:09.189
Adults should be punished in another way.

01:14:09.269 --> 01:14:10.639
How?

01:14:14.739 --> 01:14:16.899
Take on my iron fist.

01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:23.809
If I am still standing when this incense burns out,

01:14:24.049 --> 01:14:26.679
you will have to release the child.

01:14:29.389 --> 01:14:32.449
Sure! No argument about life and death?

01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:36.389
No argument!

01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:39.429
It's settled then?

01:14:40.139 --> 01:14:41.259
Yes.

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.090
Grandma, what's wrong with him?

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:35.311
Ox, ox!

01:15:38.231 --> 01:15:40.131
You don't want to hurt others,

01:15:40.901 --> 01:15:43.331
but you should let others hurt you,

01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:44.531
son!

01:15:47.371 --> 01:15:50.171
How can we stand this! Let's help him.

01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:52.501
Stop!

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.011
Stop!

01:15:58.951 --> 01:16:00.281
The incense is still burning.

01:16:32.122 --> 01:16:35.882
Stand up, stand up...

01:16:36.122 --> 01:16:38.282
Keep beating... beat him.

01:16:38.362 --> 01:16:42.162
The incense has burnt out. You lose, you lose...

01:16:48.102 --> 01:16:49.032
Let him go!

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:54.472
Let's go home, Gui. Go.

01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:39.353
Time to go home.

01:17:39.623 --> 01:17:42.613
I want to stay a little longer with ox.

01:17:43.023 --> 01:17:43.583
I don't go home.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.183
Gui, aren't you hungry?

01:17:45.433 --> 01:17:46.863
Are you not hungry? Ox might be hungry.

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:48.353
No, I am not hungry.

01:17:48.503 --> 01:17:49.893
I can stay here a little longer with Gui.

01:17:51.303 --> 01:17:52.323
Ox, you are the best.

01:17:52.973 --> 01:17:54.593
So what does that make me?

01:17:57.444 --> 01:17:59.034
Aunt Moon,

01:17:59.414 --> 01:18:02.244
can you ask ox a favor for me?

01:18:02.614 --> 01:18:03.944
You and ox are so close,

01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.374
why do you need my help?

01:18:05.454 --> 01:18:08.244
Because, you are the dearest to ox.

01:18:10.254 --> 01:18:13.554
Don't talk nonsense.

01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:17.994
Gui, you can ask me yourself.

01:18:18.464 --> 01:18:20.324
You keep refusing to teach me martial arts, but I really want to learn.

01:18:20.394 --> 01:18:21.594
I also want to learn!

01:18:22.434 --> 01:18:22.994
Gui, why do you want

01:18:23.234 --> 01:18:24.564
to learn martial arts?

01:18:24.974 --> 01:18:26.524
So the others won't bully me.

01:18:27.304 --> 01:18:28.174
What about you?

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:29.664
I want everyone to be afraid of me.

01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:31.964
What if Ning bullies you, what will you do?

01:18:32.214 --> 01:18:33.434
I will hit him back

01:18:34.484 --> 01:18:36.244
what about you, will you fight Gui back?

01:18:36.484 --> 01:18:38.474
For sure. I will fight Gui until he's scared of me.

01:18:38.554 --> 01:18:39.414
What if you can't beat him?

01:18:39.654 --> 01:18:41.274
Then, I will learn from a master

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:43.425
Then what will you do?

01:18:43.525 --> 01:18:45.615
I will learn from a master

01:18:46.025 --> 01:18:47.495
and then fight him again.

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.395
You beat him up, and he beats you up.

01:18:51.495 --> 01:18:53.625
When will this end?

01:18:58.975 --> 01:19:01.205
It's not that I don't want to teach you.

01:19:02.545 --> 01:19:04.445
I also need to think about

01:19:04.675 --> 01:19:06.235
why we learn martial arts.

01:19:08.115 --> 01:19:10.645
Let's go and catch the dragonflies!

01:19:59.206 --> 01:19:59.636
Grandma, let's eat.

01:20:00.036 --> 01:20:01.296
Ok.

01:20:08.176 --> 01:20:09.146
Grandma

01:20:09.516 --> 01:20:11.776
- Moon... - Yes, Grandma.

01:20:13.046 --> 01:20:15.606
In a few days,

01:20:15.856 --> 01:20:19.587
we should visit your parents' graves.

01:20:20.227 --> 01:20:21.127
Ok.

01:20:29.667 --> 01:20:30.467
I am going to...

01:20:30.537 --> 01:20:32.597
visit my parents' graves.

01:20:45.087 --> 01:20:46.247
Hey, ox.

01:21:57.389 --> 01:21:58.329
Have a drink of water.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.189
Can we talk?

01:22:09.969 --> 01:22:11.129
You are leaving...

01:22:16.779 --> 01:22:17.909
I was thinking...

01:22:18.549 --> 01:22:20.179
maybe I should visit my parents' graves.

01:22:22.289 --> 01:22:24.649
You should go. Family is important.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.560
I'll come back soon.

01:23:18.710 --> 01:23:20.270
You've been here for many years.

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:24.540
Yet I've always known one day you will leave.

01:23:25.821 --> 01:23:26.811
The truth is, I...

01:23:37.731 --> 01:23:41.431
Take these clean clothes for your trip.

01:23:45.971 --> 01:23:47.911
You don't even know my real name.

01:23:50.311 --> 01:23:51.541
You don't have to tell me.

01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:54.911
I don't need to know where you're from...

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:56.981
or where you're going.

01:23:58.381 --> 01:24:00.321
You will always be "ox" to me.

01:24:06.461 --> 01:24:08.051
My name is Huo Yuanjia.

01:24:50.442 --> 01:24:51.772
I'll always remember.

01:26:23.974 --> 01:26:27.534
Late Qing Dynasty

01:26:28.444 --> 01:26:31.774
Various strong countries invaded china

01:26:32.884 --> 01:26:36.145
Tianjin became partly colonized

01:27:02.115 --> 01:27:03.135
Believe in God, and you'll have everlasting life.

01:27:03.545 --> 01:27:05.915
...his words are written here.

01:27:05.985 --> 01:27:07.975
God's words...

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.476
Huo Yuanjia!

01:27:37.046 --> 01:27:39.576
Champion of Tianjin!

01:27:39.816 --> 01:27:40.976
Huo Yuanjia!

01:27:42.286 --> 01:27:45.016
Champion of Tianjin! Huo Yuanjia!

01:27:47.026 --> 01:27:49.896
Huo Yuanjia has returned to the ring.

01:27:52.126 --> 01:27:54.526
Huo Yuanjia has returned to the ring.

01:28:39.877 --> 01:28:41.677
- Young master! - Lai!

01:28:41.917 --> 01:28:42.937
You've finally returned!

01:28:43.187 --> 01:28:44.017
Good, good...

01:28:44.087 --> 01:28:45.307
Let me take your bag.

01:29:17.048 --> 01:29:19.918
Please forgive me...

01:29:20.258 --> 01:29:22.778
it was not easy maintaining this house.

01:29:45.449 --> 01:29:49.219
I did my best...

01:29:50.019 --> 01:29:51.109
trying to keep everything...

01:29:51.359 --> 01:29:52.979
the way it was.

01:29:55.789 --> 01:29:57.159
It must have been very hard for you.

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.359
I'm sorry for not doing better.

01:30:00.059 --> 01:30:01.119
Young Master.

01:30:01.199 --> 01:30:02.669
After you left...

01:30:03.099 --> 01:30:05.929
the creditors came... to collect money.

01:30:06.339 --> 01:30:07.829
Tearing this place...

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:10.799
apart.

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:15.179
The house was almost foreclosed.

01:30:17.249 --> 01:30:19.649
We would have lost...

01:30:19.979 --> 01:30:21.379
everything...

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:25.179
but someone sent money.

01:30:26.219 --> 01:30:28.089
I later figured...

01:30:28.459 --> 01:30:32.400
it was your good friend Mr. Nong Jinsun.

01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:48.240
I don't need these anymore.

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:51.880
Neither do...

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.740
my parents.

01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:58.220
Father...

01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:01.150
I...

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:05.160
finally realized...

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.230
why you held back the last blow.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:13.000
You are the true champion.

01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:15.810
Mother,

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:19.171
you taught me how to be a good person.

01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:23.281
I was too arrogant to understand.

01:31:27.221 --> 01:31:28.151
Rest assured

01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:31.081
I will not disappoint you again.

01:31:38.101 --> 01:31:39.071
My dear Jade,

01:31:40.301 --> 01:31:43.391
I was not a good father.

01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:47.331
And because of me, you suffered a horrible death.

01:31:50.811 --> 01:31:52.741
I was never good enough for you.

01:32:29.022 --> 01:32:30.112
Let's have tea.

01:32:47.942 --> 01:32:49.372
Sir, I am sorry.

01:32:49.642 --> 01:32:51.042
My boss does not want to see you,

01:32:51.272 --> 01:32:52.933
but he wants you to have this.

01:33:18.233 --> 01:33:21.203
Watch your way.

01:33:23.213 --> 01:33:26.113
Leave a way. Excuse me...

01:33:47.364 --> 01:33:51.304
Mrs. Chin, I am very sorry for what I have done.

01:33:52.504 --> 01:33:55.444
Please allow me to pay my respects.

01:34:13.124 --> 01:34:15.284
Mother. Mother.

01:34:42.425 --> 01:34:43.725
Get out and kneel down.

01:34:47.165 --> 01:34:49.095
You'll gonna have a hard time if you come again

01:34:49.365 --> 01:34:50.265
You dare to come with no money?

01:34:50.495 --> 01:34:51.125
Get away?

01:34:51.365 --> 01:34:52.295
Don't come again or you'll have a hard time.

01:34:52.565 --> 01:34:54.435
Get away...

01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:01.465
Master...

01:35:02.715 --> 01:35:03.445
Master...

01:35:03.985 --> 01:35:04.535
Master...

01:35:04.615 --> 01:35:06.245
- Master, we are sorry! - We are sorry!

01:35:08.215 --> 01:35:09.415
Master, I learned kung fu with you since I was a child.

01:35:10.225 --> 01:35:13.015
I don't know another

01:35:13.355 --> 01:35:15.756
way to making a living.

01:35:16.596 --> 01:35:18.756
Now you are back, and...

01:35:20.296 --> 01:35:21.556
Master, please forgive us!

01:35:22.466 --> 01:35:23.486
Stand up...

01:35:33.346 --> 01:35:37.406
Fresh pork, reasonable price!

01:35:41.816 --> 01:35:42.586
Fresh pork...

01:35:42.826 --> 01:35:45.556
Madam,

01:35:45.626 --> 01:35:48.146
come here, madam... It's great for making soup.

01:35:48.396 --> 01:35:50.226
It is really cheap today.

01:35:53.566 --> 01:35:54.556
Two catty (or one Kilogram) Of pork please!

01:35:58.536 --> 01:35:59.566
No business with you!

01:36:26.597 --> 01:36:27.627
Extra release!

01:36:27.697 --> 01:36:30.757
Hercules o'Brien...

01:36:31.167 --> 01:36:32.537
32 plays without losing one

01:36:32.607 --> 01:36:35.307
25 fighters seriuosly injured.

01:36:35.547 --> 01:36:37.407
Challenges all chinese fighters.

01:36:37.647 --> 01:36:38.837
Vows to defeat every...

01:36:39.247 --> 01:36:40.717
"Sick Man of Asia."

01:36:41.117 --> 01:36:42.847
No one dare to callenge him.

01:36:46.487 --> 01:36:47.577
Jinsun.

01:36:50.358 --> 01:36:51.588
I'm so sorry for what I've done.

01:36:52.758 --> 01:36:54.818
I realized my mistakes...

01:36:56.298 --> 01:36:57.558
only too late!

01:36:59.138 --> 01:37:00.598
It hurts to think about it.

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:04.398
Let's forget about the past.

01:37:05.438 --> 01:37:06.708
That chapter is over.

01:37:14.288 --> 01:37:15.448
Jinsun...

01:37:15.748 --> 01:37:17.308
I don't know how to begin,

01:37:17.558 --> 01:37:18.848
but you're the only one I can turn to.

01:37:19.788 --> 01:37:21.418
I need to borrow some money.

01:37:21.588 --> 01:37:23.718
What? You still want to fight?

01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:25.888
Yes.

01:37:27.728 --> 01:37:29.498
You cannot go down that path again.

01:37:30.168 --> 01:37:31.788
I will not give you any money.

01:38:20.789 --> 01:38:21.719
Young Master.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.750
Master Huo,

01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.790
my master wants you to have this.

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.590
Who's your master?

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:34.700
His name is Nong, Nong Jinsun.

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.380
The Shanghai Race club 1909

01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:58.220
Ladies and Gentlemen...

01:38:58.690 --> 01:39:02.220
Brace yourself... for a man who

01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:05.500
can move a train with one hand...

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.560
and punch through the Great wall.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.931
He can kill a chinese fighter...

01:39:11.371 --> 01:39:14.271
with his little finger.

01:39:15.641 --> 01:39:16.801
Now. Welcome the 9th wonder of the world...

01:39:17.041 --> 01:39:19.741
the strongest man in history...

01:39:19.981 --> 01:39:22.681
o'Brien!

01:39:47.711 --> 01:39:49.641
Today's challenger is...

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:53.281
Huo Yuanjia of Tianjin!

01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:00.512
Good!

01:40:16.042 --> 01:40:17.662
Sign the Death waiver.

01:40:19.482 --> 01:40:20.502
Please inform him,

01:40:21.042 --> 01:40:23.312
that taking a life in a competition...

01:40:23.552 --> 01:40:25.042
is a cruel and backward tradition.

01:40:25.752 --> 01:40:27.612
May I suggest that we compete

01:40:27.852 --> 01:40:29.282
with honor and civility.

01:40:39.502 --> 01:40:41.792
He wants to kick your butt.

01:40:47.703 --> 01:40:48.033
Come on

01:40:48.473 --> 01:40:50.373
Let the match begin!

01:41:01.123 --> 01:41:02.053
Come on

01:41:07.763 --> 01:41:08.693
come on

01:41:32.884 --> 01:41:33.984
Good!

01:43:46.656 --> 01:43:48.996
Good! Good!

01:43:54.967 --> 01:43:56.097
It'an honor.

01:44:26.867 --> 01:44:28.067
Thank you.

01:44:32.037 --> 01:44:34.137
Good!

01:44:44.888 --> 01:44:46.748
Chinese Martial Artist Defeats US champion o'Brien

01:44:46.988 --> 01:44:49.788
chinese Fighter Defeats western Boxer.

01:44:50.028 --> 01:44:51.118
Victory Shocks Shanghai!

01:44:51.358 --> 01:44:55.358
Huo Yuanjia Says wushu Schools Must Unite

01:44:56.668 --> 01:44:58.228
Fighter Founds Jingwu Sports Federation.

01:44:58.638 --> 01:44:59.628
Recruits country's Best

01:45:01.138 --> 01:45:04.108
Shanghai Foreign correspondents club

01:45:06.148 --> 01:45:07.198
Thank you.

01:45:08.148 --> 01:45:09.008
Master!

01:45:09.248 --> 01:45:10.768
You've received a dinner invitation.

01:45:20.928 --> 01:45:22.358
I never dreamed it would be you.

01:45:23.128 --> 01:45:26.388
I've been waiting for this day, Yuanjia.

01:45:29.099 --> 01:45:30.259
Am I still your friend?

01:45:31.269 --> 01:45:33.099
Your friendship... is very important to me.

01:45:34.069 --> 01:45:35.129
How can I not?

01:45:35.939 --> 01:45:39.339
I always knew that you would not disappoint me.

01:45:41.819 --> 01:45:43.749
But I did, for a long time.

01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:47.779
Let's not talk about the past.

01:45:48.659 --> 01:45:50.279
Come, have a seat.

01:45:52.389 --> 01:45:54.719
Here, your favorite wine.

01:45:56.429 --> 01:45:57.259
Come on.

01:45:59.269 --> 01:46:00.159
What's the matter?

01:46:00.329 --> 01:46:02.769
I stopped drinking. A long time ago.

01:46:03.339 --> 01:46:05.269
Why?

01:46:05.769 --> 01:46:07.709
But you loved to drink.

01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:10.239
I've learned from my mistakes.

01:46:12.849 --> 01:46:13.939
That's wonderful.

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:17.180
Let's have tea instead.

01:46:26.290 --> 01:46:27.090
Yuanjia.

01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:32.700
Your victory gained respect for all chinese people.

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.330
The foreigners have bullied us for too long.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.830
Someone should stand up.

01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:40.070
If that hadrt happened, they would have continued to see us

01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:41.780
as the sick man of East Asia!

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:43.870
My friend...

01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:46.140
I'm really proud of you.

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:47.970
Enjoy!

01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:52.180
Chinese must get strengthened.

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.910
The westerners despised us partially

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.210
because we've been busy

01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:59.860
fighting among ourselves.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:03.731
That becomes a laughing stock for others.

01:47:07.301 --> 01:47:09.861
Foreigners see us as the sick man of East Asia!

01:47:10.411 --> 01:47:11.871
What they call us is irrelevant.

01:47:12.811 --> 01:47:13.211
What matters is

01:47:13.441 --> 01:47:16.411
if we are really sick,

01:47:18.851 --> 01:47:20.821
or, if we are not attempting to cure

01:47:21.121 --> 01:47:22.281
the disease even

01:47:22.521 --> 01:47:24.211
when we know it is there.

01:47:25.151 --> 01:47:26.981
They still flaut their superiority.

01:47:33.231 --> 01:47:37.791
I didn't expect you to be so insightful.

01:47:39.301 --> 01:47:44.801
Compared to you, I am kind of bookish.

01:47:53.082 --> 01:47:54.012
Jinsun,

01:47:54.382 --> 01:47:55.512
when do you return to Tianjin?

01:47:56.352 --> 01:47:58.792
I'm going to stay in Shanghai.

01:48:00.122 --> 01:48:01.562
Who about your restaurant?

01:48:03.362 --> 01:48:04.192
I sold it.

01:48:04.262 --> 01:48:05.452
What?

01:48:06.162 --> 01:48:07.492
But it was so profitable.

01:48:08.262 --> 01:48:10.132
The Jingwu Sports Federation needs...

01:48:10.502 --> 01:48:12.232
start-up funds.

01:48:15.412 --> 01:48:18.532
But the restaurant has been your life!

01:48:19.312 --> 01:48:20.972
My restaurant means little...

01:48:21.252 --> 01:48:22.372
compared to...

01:48:22.612 --> 01:48:24.272
your vision.

01:48:25.222 --> 01:48:26.182
Yuanjia.

01:48:26.422 --> 01:48:28.252
I do not know wushu.

01:48:29.852 --> 01:48:33.312
But I do know how to help.

01:48:35.432 --> 01:48:36.453
I hope it will enough.

01:48:39.303 --> 01:48:40.263
Jinsun!

01:48:41.073 --> 01:48:42.933
I was gone for quite a few years.

01:48:43.933 --> 01:48:46.373
Everyday I asked myself

01:48:46.973 --> 01:48:49.303
why I learned kung fu,

01:48:50.173 --> 01:48:53.613
and whether or not it was only for fighting.

01:48:54.583 --> 01:48:56.143
Have you had an answer?

01:48:58.623 --> 01:49:00.023
Only the weak

01:49:00.653 --> 01:49:03.523
need to prove their power through force,

01:49:05.593 --> 01:49:08.353
but what force leads to

01:49:08.433 --> 01:49:10.193
is endless hatred.

01:49:11.363 --> 01:49:12.963
I want to change kung fu

01:49:13.233 --> 01:49:15.393
into a sport,

01:49:16.373 --> 01:49:19.833
with which one can shape oneself both physically and spiritually.

01:49:20.173 --> 01:49:21.303
That's a good idea.

01:49:22.373 --> 01:49:24.314
You should let more know about it.

01:49:26.244 --> 01:49:28.544
I don't know how much I can achieve,

01:49:30.024 --> 01:49:31.354
but I will try my best.

01:49:36.594 --> 01:49:37.924
Did you hear that?

01:49:38.924 --> 01:49:39.894
Yes,

01:49:41.234 --> 01:49:44.224
I heard a voice calling.

01:49:46.574 --> 01:49:48.164
Now what we hear

01:49:48.434 --> 01:49:49.964
is the same voice!

01:49:53.374 --> 01:49:56.604
Jingwu Sports Federation

01:50:00.514 --> 01:50:01.344
Yuanjia!

01:50:03.354 --> 01:50:04.014
Zhaojian

01:50:04.254 --> 01:50:05.184
I was wrong to disrespect you,

01:50:06.124 --> 01:50:07.384
Master Huo. I hope that...

01:50:08.354 --> 01:50:09.154
I am so glad that you are here.

01:50:09.394 --> 01:50:10.654
I was going to pick you up.

01:50:11.465 --> 01:50:12.425
Laifu,

01:50:12.495 --> 01:50:13.325
Master

01:50:13.395 --> 01:50:15.055
would you please show Mr. Zhao around?

01:50:19.305 --> 01:50:20.205
Yuanjia!

01:50:22.475 --> 01:50:25.235
As we've discussed, the Jingwu Manifesto.

01:50:25.475 --> 01:50:26.445
Take a look.

01:50:29.415 --> 01:50:32.385
Our motto:

01:50:33.055 --> 01:50:35.545
"Body, Mind and Soul".

01:50:36.985 --> 01:50:39.385
Wushu is a way to cultivate one's body, mind and soul.

01:50:40.055 --> 01:50:41.385
All wushu disciplines are respected equally.

01:50:41.725 --> 01:50:44.285
By working together...

01:50:46.265 --> 01:50:49.025
we can better ourselves...

01:50:49.505 --> 01:50:52.125
and stand strong as one nation

01:50:52.435 --> 01:50:55.735
we influence others through...

01:50:56.175 --> 01:50:59.546
cooperation, not intimidation.

01:50:59.616 --> 01:51:00.946
Through this ideal, we will always...

01:51:01.186 --> 01:51:02.406
Stand Strong!

01:51:03.616 --> 01:51:05.746
Jingwu Sports Federation 1910

01:51:10.796 --> 01:51:11.956
Shanghai Foreign chamber of commerce

01:51:12.226 --> 01:51:13.656
well, gentlemen, it's too rich for me,

01:51:14.066 --> 01:51:15.996
I only bet on sure things.

01:51:18.496 --> 01:51:19.556
Then perhaps you'll be interested...

01:51:19.796 --> 01:51:22.526
in joining our little wager against this...

01:51:22.766 --> 01:51:24.736
Huo Yuanjia fellow?

01:51:25.536 --> 01:51:26.636
He'd better lose this time.

01:51:27.036 --> 01:51:30.206
It cost me 6,000 francs when he beat this o' Brien.

01:51:30.576 --> 01:51:32.166
Mr. Mita here...

01:51:32.446 --> 01:51:35.436
will ensure that you win back everything that you lost...

01:51:35.546 --> 01:51:37.076
plus a little bit more.

01:51:37.416 --> 01:51:40.386
I've suggested a competition of four matches...

01:51:40.486 --> 01:51:42.976
between our countries' best against him.

01:51:43.326 --> 01:51:46.727
We beat him and leave the chinese with nothing to brag about.

01:51:47.127 --> 01:51:48.327
Four against one?

01:51:48.627 --> 01:51:51.397
What makes you so sure he is going to accept that?

01:51:51.497 --> 01:51:53.367
Pride? Honor?

01:51:53.607 --> 01:51:55.197
The prestige of his school?

01:51:55.437 --> 01:51:56.567
It's of no importance.

01:51:57.177 --> 01:51:59.107
He has already accepted the challenge.

01:51:59.507 --> 01:52:01.997
Then, gentlemen, I'll take you up on your wager.

01:52:02.277 --> 01:52:04.037
And to make it a little more interesting...

01:52:04.647 --> 01:52:06.617
I'm going to back the chinese.

01:52:08.187 --> 01:52:11.377
Mita... you are certain Huo Yuanjia will lose?

01:52:11.617 --> 01:52:13.487
With what I have in mind...

01:52:13.857 --> 01:52:15.717
our victory is guaranteed.

01:52:35.618 --> 01:52:36.448
Yuanjia

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:39.508
one of the contestants

01:52:39.748 --> 01:52:42.348
Tanaka, the Japanese fighter...

01:52:42.618 --> 01:52:43.748
wishes to meet you.

01:52:44.358 --> 01:52:47.618
I heard he remains undefeated. He is one of the best.

01:52:50.598 --> 01:52:53.068
Good, one can always learn from the best.

01:52:53.628 --> 01:52:56.798
I suspect that the Foreign chamber of commerce...

01:52:57.238 --> 01:52:58.528
might have a hidden agenda.

01:52:58.868 --> 01:52:59.568
How can they set up...

01:52:59.808 --> 01:53:02.368
a 'one against four' contest?

01:53:02.808 --> 01:53:03.778
It is...

01:53:04.208 --> 01:53:06.768
an attempt to humiliate us,

01:53:07.178 --> 01:53:10.478
and undermine our position.

01:53:11.748 --> 01:53:12.738
You're right.

01:53:13.688 --> 01:53:16.448
One against four is unfair...

01:53:16.688 --> 01:53:18.208
plus I have to win each match.

01:53:20.359 --> 01:53:21.729
But not everything in life...

01:53:22.599 --> 01:53:25.689
is fair.

01:53:28.739 --> 01:53:30.399
For the sake of the Federation,

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:33.559
I have no other choice.

01:53:34.409 --> 01:53:35.599
What if?

01:53:36.739 --> 01:53:40.269
Jinsun, I want to ask you to do something...

01:53:40.509 --> 01:53:41.449
what is it?

01:53:42.619 --> 01:53:45.749
After this fight, you should head the Sports Federation.

01:53:46.549 --> 01:53:47.489
Why?

01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:52.659
I want to visit Moon and Grandma.

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:54.489
I made a promise.

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:10.240
Do you know anything...

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.840
about teas?

01:54:14.850 --> 01:54:17.650
I don't really want to know...

01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:21.140
because I don't like categories.

01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:22.720
Tea is tea.

01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:24.690
Each has its own characteristics

01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:26.520
hence different grades.

01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:31.900
What's the purpose of grading?

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.930
All teas are grown in nature...

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.830
with little discernable differences

01:54:38.710 --> 01:54:39.900
So you really don't know teas.

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.680
Once you learn you can tell the differences.

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.940
Maybe you're right.

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.310
The way I see it...

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.410
the tea does not...

01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:51.750
judge itself.

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:53.920
People...

01:54:54.391 --> 01:54:56.291
judge the tea.

01:54:56.931 --> 01:54:58.861
As for me, I don't want to do that.

01:54:59.301 --> 01:55:01.461
Why not?

01:55:01.931 --> 01:55:03.901
When you are in a good mood,

01:55:04.401 --> 01:55:05.701
the grade of the tea...

01:55:06.801 --> 01:55:09.401
does not matter.

01:55:09.911 --> 01:55:12.431
I've never seen it that way.

01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:16.411
In your opinion, is one style of wushu superior...

01:55:16.981 --> 01:55:20.681
to another?

01:55:21.021 --> 01:55:22.491
I don't think so.

01:55:23.891 --> 01:55:26.791
If no particular style is superior...

01:55:27.791 --> 01:55:29.731
why have...

01:55:30.461 --> 01:55:32.021
so many competitions?

01:55:32.761 --> 01:55:34.731
I believe...

01:55:35.001 --> 01:55:37.401
no single style is superior.

01:55:37.831 --> 01:55:40.431
Only different skill levels.

01:55:41.372 --> 01:55:42.812
It is through training that...

01:55:42.872 --> 01:55:44.772
one discovers one's strength.

01:55:45.942 --> 01:55:47.882
Perhaps, the most formidable...

01:55:48.412 --> 01:55:49.812
enemy lies within onself.

01:55:50.482 --> 01:55:54.042
Competitions can lead us to a path of self-discovery?

01:55:54.852 --> 01:55:55.722
You mean...

01:55:55.792 --> 01:55:56.852
our most important battle...

01:55:57.292 --> 01:55:58.652
is actually fought within?

01:56:09.572 --> 01:56:10.832
Your words

01:56:11.072 --> 01:56:13.942
are poignant.

01:56:16.912 --> 01:56:18.902
Let's...

01:56:19.312 --> 01:56:21.942
enjoy the tea.

01:56:22.582 --> 01:56:25.572
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

01:57:54.014 --> 01:57:57.914
Shanghai 1910

01:58:00.584 --> 01:58:03.785
French concession Pierre Theatre

01:58:06.125 --> 01:58:08.055
The Fight Arena

01:58:39.925 --> 01:58:42.485
Today's battle

01:58:42.725 --> 01:58:45.565
is between four fighters from the Foreign chamber of commerce

01:58:45.795 --> 01:58:48.765
and Huo Yuanjia of the Jingwu Sports Federation.

01:58:58.846 --> 01:59:00.606
Whichever side falls first

01:59:00.846 --> 01:59:02.506
or signals to admit defeat

01:59:02.756 --> 01:59:05.776
will be considered to have lost the match.

01:59:07.656 --> 01:59:09.026
This is unusual.

01:59:10.926 --> 01:59:12.686
Four against one?

01:59:14.226 --> 01:59:15.956
You never told me.

01:59:16.236 --> 01:59:17.786
Both the chamber of commerce...

01:59:18.036 --> 01:59:19.966
and the Federation agreed.

01:59:20.066 --> 01:59:21.266
Don't be concerned.

01:59:21.736 --> 01:59:23.866
This is not a competition.

01:59:25.206 --> 01:59:26.676
This is murder.

01:59:26.906 --> 01:59:28.936
Tanaka, you're overreacting.

01:59:29.546 --> 01:59:31.706
Huo Yuanjia fought the best fighters... from around the world.

01:59:31.946 --> 01:59:32.916
And won each time.

01:59:33.016 --> 01:59:35.536
The rules... he set them up.

01:59:35.786 --> 01:59:37.086
Mita,

01:59:38.917 --> 01:59:40.547
what's your deal?

01:59:41.687 --> 01:59:43.287
Is this really for the pride of Japan?

01:59:43.697 --> 01:59:45.027
Or did you place a large bet?

01:59:47.067 --> 01:59:48.627
The spirit of wushu...

01:59:49.097 --> 01:59:50.757
is the most important thing.

01:59:54.107 --> 01:59:55.897
To compete is to win.

01:59:56.777 --> 01:59:59.537
Now the first round! Huo Yuanjia against the British boxer!

02:00:03.877 --> 02:00:06.577
British Boxer, Peter Smith

02:00:11.657 --> 02:00:12.087
Start!

02:00:47.658 --> 02:00:50.648
Belgium Royal Riding coach, Hanks Herzog

02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:47.179
Great job, master!

02:01:57.069 --> 02:02:00.090
Fencing champion of Europe, Antony Kasia

02:03:07.341 --> 02:03:09.271
This is our embarrassment. We can't let him win.

02:03:19.751 --> 02:03:21.311
The fourth and final contest will now begin.

02:03:21.551 --> 02:03:24.321
The competitor to represent the Foreign chamber of commerce...

02:03:24.561 --> 02:03:27.391
is Tanaka from Japan.

02:03:31.201 --> 02:03:31.991
Begin!

02:03:32.801 --> 02:03:33.962
Yuanjia.

02:03:34.302 --> 02:03:36.932
This is an unfair contest.

02:03:37.802 --> 02:03:40.532
If you wish to re-schedule...

02:03:41.042 --> 02:03:42.942
that's fine with me.

02:03:43.512 --> 02:03:45.312
You're very kind.

02:03:46.012 --> 02:03:47.882
We started the fight...

02:03:48.452 --> 02:03:49.852
we must finish.

02:03:51.052 --> 02:03:51.812
Please!

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:10.432
Begin!

02:05:20.384 --> 02:05:21.344
Master, that's great!

02:06:08.495 --> 02:06:10.325
This round is a draw.

02:06:10.965 --> 02:06:13.025
Please set down your weapons, gentlemen...

02:06:13.405 --> 02:06:15.305
and prepare for hand-to-hand combat.

02:06:19.035 --> 02:06:20.375
Mita, where have you been?

02:06:20.745 --> 02:06:22.265
This is embarrassing. He's going to lose.

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:25.715
Don't worry, gentlemen. I have it under control.

02:07:21.106 --> 02:07:21.666
Yuanjia!

02:07:34.817 --> 02:07:35.977
Time out!

02:07:36.687 --> 02:07:39.587
- What's going on? - What is he doing?

02:07:43.827 --> 02:07:44.387
Yuanjia!

02:07:44.627 --> 02:07:47.097
- Tanaka! - Go now! Go! Go!

02:07:52.307 --> 02:07:53.767
What happened? What happened?

02:07:55.077 --> 02:07:55.737
What happened?

02:07:56.137 --> 02:07:57.037
Poisoned!

02:07:57.277 --> 02:08:00.077
Poison? What poison?

02:08:00.517 --> 02:08:01.637
How did this happen?

02:08:03.117 --> 02:08:04.547
- What do you need? - Tea...

02:08:04.617 --> 02:08:06.047
Tea!

02:08:06.447 --> 02:08:07.477
Where's the teapot?

02:08:08.317 --> 02:08:11.517
The tea is laced. But it's gone!

02:08:11.757 --> 02:08:14.287
We're going straight to the hospital.

02:08:15.597 --> 02:08:19.468
Too late. The toxin is...

02:08:19.528 --> 02:08:20.358
in my blood!

02:08:20.598 --> 02:08:22.468
Let me take revenge.

02:08:25.408 --> 02:08:26.568
Sheng,

02:08:28.578 --> 02:08:30.238
we...

02:08:31.108 --> 02:08:32.378
must not.

02:08:35.618 --> 02:08:36.678
Revenge only...

02:08:37.618 --> 02:08:39.588
brings more bloodshed.

02:08:41.458 --> 02:08:42.818
No more revenge.

02:08:45.658 --> 02:08:49.098
We must strive to better ourselves.

02:08:49.328 --> 02:08:52.498
Forget the competition.

02:08:52.568 --> 02:08:54.728
We're going to hospital.

02:08:58.568 --> 02:08:59.558
Jinsun.

02:09:01.108 --> 02:09:02.868
It took me years to understand...

02:09:04.849 --> 02:09:08.579
the true meaning of wushu,

02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:12.519
and its purpose.

02:09:13.819 --> 02:09:15.689
The competition must continue.

02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:18.629
One cannot choose...

02:09:18.859 --> 02:09:20.589
how one's life begins.

02:09:23.229 --> 02:09:26.669
But one can choose... to face the end with courage.

02:09:32.679 --> 02:09:33.729
Master.

02:09:34.409 --> 02:09:36.609
What are you doing? Finish him off in the next round!

02:09:36.849 --> 02:09:37.909
Why do you say that?

02:09:38.949 --> 02:09:40.349
It's not for you to decide.

02:09:40.579 --> 02:09:41.639
I must win this fight!

02:09:41.889 --> 02:09:43.679
Whatever it takes. Just win!

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:54.290
We... Stand strong!

02:09:54.530 --> 02:10:04.130
Stand strong! Stand strong!

02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:05.340
You really want to win?

02:10:26.530 --> 02:10:27.560
Let's stop.

02:10:28.230 --> 02:10:30.720
Treasure your life.

02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:34.340
Listen to them...

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:37.780
it's not just about me.

02:10:43.821 --> 02:10:44.711
If you wish to continue,

02:10:45.521 --> 02:10:47.881
I won't hold back.

02:10:50.361 --> 02:10:51.651
It is my honor.

02:12:54.423 --> 02:12:55.783
Young Master...

02:12:57.523 --> 02:12:59.423
He's down! He's down! Huo Yuanjia's down!

02:12:59.723 --> 02:13:02.884
Go! Go! Go!

02:13:02.964 --> 02:13:04.524
Make the announcement!

02:13:11.074 --> 02:13:12.634
Wait!

02:13:35.194 --> 02:13:36.124
Huo...

02:13:36.764 --> 02:13:38.954
Yuan... Jia!

02:13:39.164 --> 02:13:40.934
Yuanjia!

02:13:41.064 --> 02:13:54.505
Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia!

02:14:01.955 --> 02:14:02.945
Tanaka, you son-of-a bitch.

02:14:03.195 --> 02:14:04.855
What is this?

02:14:04.965 --> 02:14:05.945
I lost!

02:14:06.025 --> 02:14:07.925
Who said you lost?

02:14:08.165 --> 02:14:09.995
I know it in my heart.

02:14:10.435 --> 02:14:11.425
I lost. Fair and square.

02:14:12.035 --> 02:14:13.395
Who do you think you are?

02:14:13.635 --> 02:14:14.795
You have no right to decide.

02:14:14.905 --> 02:14:16.835
You can't be Japanese.

02:14:25.985 --> 02:14:29.745
You are a disgrace to Japan!

02:14:31.725 --> 02:14:41.426
Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia!

02:16:35.948 --> 02:16:40.788
Huo Yuanjia died from poisoning at the age of 42.

02:16:42.157 --> 02:16:44.058
"The spirit of wushu" as espoused by Huo Yuanjia continues to

02:16:44.128 --> 02:16:46.147
spread and thrive long after he passed away...

02:16:46.227 --> 02:16:48.258
today, the Jingwu Sports Federation flourishes around the world,

02:16:48.698 --> 02:16:49.628
with branches in over 50 countries.

02:16:50.897 --> 02:16:52.698
To commemorate Huo Yuenjia's spirit.

02:16:52.938 --> 02:16:54.098
Inscribed by Sun zhongshan, Father of the nation

02:16:55.608 --> 02:16:58.369
To uphold the spirit of wushu by Sunwen

02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:02.830
Excuse me! Miss. Yang?

02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:04.299
What are your chances?

02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:06.680
I did my best. That's what's important.

02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:08.110
Is it enough?

02:18:09.305 --> 02:18:15.342
