other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.990
(LAUGHING)

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.750
Yeah.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.220
- That's a good laugh, right?
- I'm sorry.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.180
- No, listen... I get it.
- I'm sorry.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.348
I know I made enemies.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.141
I'm conducting a little, though.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.500
They brought back
the JVC Fest this year.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.749
They got me opening in a couple
of weeks with a pro band.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.509
That's great.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.500
Yeah. It's all right.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.941
Truth is,
I don't think people understood

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.831
what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.664
I wasn't there to conduct.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.420
Any fucking moron can wave his arms
and keep people in tempo.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.182
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.029
I believe that is...

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.946
an absolute necessity.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.869
Otherwise, we're depriving the world
of the next Louis Armstrong.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.625
The next Charlie Parker.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.460
I told you about how Charlie Parker
became Charlie Parker, right?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.460
- Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
- Exactly.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.780
Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.622
Gets up to play at a cutting session,
and he fucks it up.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.630
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.466
And he's laughed off-stage.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.420
Cries himself to sleep that night,
but the next morning, what does he do?

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.588
He practices.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.740
And he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind,

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.546
never to be laughed at again.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.700
And a year later, he goes back to the
Reno and he steps up on that stage,

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.427
and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.580
So imagine if Jones had just said:

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:22.866
"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job."

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.109
And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.140
End of story.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.024
No Bird.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.507
That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.865
But that's just
what the world wants now.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.229
People wonder why jazz is dying.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:52.620
I tell you, man,
and every Starbucks "jazz" album

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.266
just proves my point, really.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.780
There are no two words in the
English language more harmful

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.823
than "good job."

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.302
But is there a line?

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.020
You know, maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next Charlie Parker

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.260
- from ever becoming Charlie Parker.
- No, man, no.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.862
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.670
Yeah.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.740
The truth is, Andrew...

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.111
I never really had a Charlie Parker.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.829
But I tried.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.380
I actually fucking tried.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.500
And that's more than
most people ever do.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.945
And I will never apologize
for how I tried.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.102
(SIGHS)

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.540
ANDREW: I'll see you later.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.901
FLETCHER: Yeah.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.500
Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this,

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:19.867
but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.468
You understand what I'm saying?

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.540
No.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.020
I'm using the Studio Band playlist.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.588
You know, "Caravan," "Whiplash."

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.502
I need somebody who really
knows those charts.

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.064
What about Ryan Connolly?

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.780
All Connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.867
- Tanner?
- Tanner switched to premed.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.430
I guess he got discouraged.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.544
Hey. Uh...

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.307
Take the weekend. Think about it.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.065
- NICOLE (OVER PHONE): Hello?
- ANDREW: Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.545
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:35.620
It's been a while
since I talked to you. Um...

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.700
Look, I...

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.220
I'm really sorry about everything.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:47.985
I know that's not, you know, enough,
but I'm just really sorry. Um...

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.500
But anyway, I got...
I actually have this show this weekend.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.380
It's a, uh...

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.900
Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't
know if maybe you'd wanna go,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.740
and we, you know,
maybe get some, like, pizza afterwards,

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.700
and, like, complain
about our schools again.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.980
What is...? You said Jayvees?

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.184
No, it's, heh, JVC.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.550
It's like a... It's a jazz thing.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.500
Yeah.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.384
Oh, okay.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:33.461
Well, I don't know if I can come.
I... I'll have to check with my boyfriend.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.745
Okay.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.505
Yeah.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.340
Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.820
I don't really think
he likes jazz music.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.785
Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.584
Okay. Well, I guess
maybe I'll see you guys there.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.020
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.665

I'm Terence Fletcher, these are some
of the best musicians in New York,

which means they're some of
the best musicians in the world.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.540
We're gonna do some old standards,
but we're gonna start with a new tune
