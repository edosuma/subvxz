I have the misfortune

00:03.919 --> 00:05.020
of speaking to my mother.

00:05.021 --> 00:06.530
I have come to heal our family.

00:06.531 --> 00:09.157
I will undo everything
that has been done,

00:09.158 --> 00:10.999
thereby giving you a new life.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.337
You should get out of here.

00:12.338 --> 00:14.147
My brother is not
the forgiving kind.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.354
I'm not afraid of him.

00:15.355 --> 00:17.832
I'm about to get even with Klaus,
and you're gonna help me.

00:32.390 --> 00:33.897
You are my son.

00:33.898 --> 00:36.977
I brought him here to be
the father you never had.

00:36.978 --> 00:39.278
You said you wanted Elijah.
He's sleeping.

00:39.279 --> 00:42.355
When he wakes, he'll
make his own decision.

00:43.842 --> 00:45.773
You cannot catch me, Elijah.

00:45.774 --> 00:48.611
You're getting faster, Klaus,
but you're not yet fast enough.

01:38.539 --> 01:41.625
Our mother thinks she will win
because she has left you alone,

she has forced upon you.

02:15.284 --> 02:18.975
Is this rash a side effect

02:18.976 --> 02:21.180
of the witchy acid trip he's on?

02:25.211 --> 02:28.664
I haven't seen this

home from battle

02:30.368 --> 02:32.238
more blindly
temperamental than usual,

02:32.239 --> 02:34.479
and our mother
would use the petals

02:34.480 --> 02:37.264
of a rare Marelok orchid
to put him to sleep.

02:37.265 --> 02:39.850
She would mend his mind
with a spell

02:39.851 --> 02:43.931
and then wake him with
the roots of the same plant.

02:43.932 --> 02:47.001
If she has access to it now,

02:47.002 --> 02:49.484
then maybe it also
grows in the bayou.

02:49.485 --> 02:51.411
You stay here with your wolves

02:51.412 --> 02:53.193

your mother's head off.

Elijah were to wake

03:03.202 --> 03:04.805

of her madness?

and rip Vincent's head off.

13:16.403 --> 13:17.820
Nah. He'll body jump.

13:17.821 --> 13:19.405
His head stays on.

13:19.406 --> 13:21.617
He'll have a hard time
answering our questions

13:21.618 --> 13:23.659

13:23.660 --> 13:28.414
Sweet. It's a big box
of dusty, old junk. We're saved.

13:28.415 --> 13:30.560
They're dark objects
my uncle left for me.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.596
I've been cataloging them
according to Kieran's notes.

13:32.597 --> 13:34.297
As far as I can tell,
these can be used

13:34.298 --> 13:36.399
against witches specifically.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.424
Kinky.

13:38.425 --> 13:40.305
I remember these.
What?

13:40.306 --> 13:42.303
100 years ago, the human faction

13:42.304 --> 13:44.138
waged a war
against the voodoo queens.

13:44.139 --> 13:45.809
They had a trader
spell these manacles.

13:45.810 --> 13:47.780
You slap them on a witch,

13:47.781 --> 13:49.818

as long as they're on.

13:49.819 --> 13:51.421
All right.

Well, we're not gonna get
the handcuffs of doom on him

13:52.891 --> 13:54.391
while he's surrounded
by a werewolf entourage.

13:54.392 --> 13:56.818
We just lure him away.
I can do that.

13:56.819 --> 13:59.767
Cami, if we do this,
you're the bait.

13:59.768 --> 14:03.277
Are you sure you're
ok with that?

questions for me.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.441
Just one.

14:22.442 --> 14:23.842

14:23.843 --> 14:24.876
without having to listen
to the pointless

14:24.877 --> 14:27.813

14:27.814 --> 14:30.476
I'm afraid the price
of my expertise

14:30.477 --> 14:33.354
is conversation.

14:33.355 --> 14:35.059
You know, I used
to tell myself that

14:35.060 --> 14:38.192
my real father must have
had no idea I existed.

14:38.193 --> 14:41.130
Otherwise, he'd never leave
me to suffer under Mikael.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.001
Esther forbade me
from seeing you.

14:43.002 --> 14:44.737
So I waited, knowing
that one day,

14:46.074 --> 14:49.031

Mikael found me first.

Yes.

is just a few years too late.

15:00.553 --> 15:02.688

beyond for centuries.

15:04.624 --> 15:06.624

corners of the world,

15:06.625 --> 15:08.426

feasted on the blood

15:08.427 --> 15:10.363

extraordinary men,

15:10.364 --> 15:12.930
but you've never
found true peace.

15:15.765 --> 15:17.432
The only moments of joy
in your life,

15:17.433 --> 15:22.000
however fleeting, have
been simple pleasures...

15:22.001 --> 15:24.906
As you climbed the Himalayas,

15:24.907 --> 15:27.308
as you tended to your horses,

15:27.309 --> 15:29.144

that boy Shakespeare.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.280

I watched you paint.

15:31.281 --> 15:33.548
I watched you feel your
unborn daughter's kick.

15:34.082 --> 15:36.751
I said stop.

15:36.752 --> 15:39.757
A millennium of observing me,

15:39.758 --> 15:42.715

I slaughtered whole villages,

thousands of innocents?

18:16.386 --> 18:18.751
out of your bag, give it to her

About 100 years ago,

18:44.353 --> 18:47.149
this tomb used to be
my playhouse.

18:47.150 --> 18:48.759
The witches I used to run with,

18:48.760 --> 18:51.697
they used to make all
kinds of magic in here,

18:51.698 --> 18:54.430
that is, until I pissed
the prettiest one off,

18:54.431 --> 18:57.576
as I tend to do, and,
well, she locked me out.

18:57.577 --> 18:59.370
So why do you need my blood?

18:59.371 --> 19:03.499
Her name was Mary-Alice Claire.

19:03.500 --> 19:08.053
Only a Claire witch
can open this tomb.

19:23.472 --> 19:26.409
Where'd you get all this stuff?

19:26.410 --> 19:28.411
Well, I was a vampire.

19:28.412 --> 19:31.193
I could get anything I wanted,

19:31.194 --> 19:33.154
but I couldn't
practice witchcraft.

19:33.155 --> 19:35.456
So I charmed some witches,
and I taught them

19:35.457 --> 19:37.762
a new kind of magic that
I learned in Arabia

19:37.763 --> 19:40.563
called Kemiya.

19:40.564 --> 19:43.898
We made items that
allowed me to use magic

19:43.899 --> 19:46.250
without doing magic.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.438
You taught them how
to make dark objects.

19:48.439 --> 19:50.908
Yeah, and for a time,

19:51.426 --> 19:53.110
they were scattered
all around the city.

of me find out

19:54.411 --> 19:57.094

because you don't have
enough power on your own.

26:08.091 --> 26:11.268
Oh, Kemiya is about chemistry.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.340
It's about connection,
and after what happened

26:13.341 --> 26:14.774
with the white oak stake,

26:14.775 --> 26:16.909
I don't think you could
deny what we have.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.745
So, here, hold my hand.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.048
That's a giant diamond.

26:22.049 --> 26:23.684
It's a paragon diamond.

26:24.186 --> 26:27.220
They use them to conduct power.

26:27.221 --> 26:29.319
Is the hand holding
really necessary?

26:29.320 --> 26:31.057
I mean, we could make out,

26:31.058 --> 26:34.324
but would that not be
entirely distracting?

26:34.325 --> 26:36.099
[Sighs]

26:36.100 --> 26:38.865
All right.
Follow my lead.

26:43.209 --> 26:44.496
Close your eyes.

26:47.714 --> 26:49.881
[Chanting]

26:49.882 --> 26:52.087
[Both chanting]

27:01.436 --> 27:02.639
Heh.

27:14.324 --> 27:16.017
[Gasps]

27:34.175 --> 27:37.137
To replace the one I broke.

27:37.138 --> 27:39.640
We changed it.

27:39.641 --> 27:41.883
Oh, Davina Claire,

27:41.884 --> 27:43.930
we're gonna change everything.

27:52.528 --> 27:55.530
This will help Elijah.

27:55.531 --> 27:58.158
Ansel...

27:58.159 --> 28:01.576
I'd be lying if I said
your offer wasn't appealing.

28:01.577 --> 28:05.713
I've never known a parent
to be a benevolent force.

28:08.117 --> 28:12.122
I think I would have liked
to have been your son,

28:12.123 --> 28:14.671
but a different path
was chosen for me,

28:14.672 --> 28:17.964
and I have for
the past 1,000 years

28:17.965 --> 28:23.303
been son of Mikael...
Paranoid, vengeful...

28:25.204 --> 28:28.909
And powerful enough
to protect my daughter.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.604
I want to help you defend her.

28:30.605 --> 28:32.818
I believe you,

28:32.819 --> 28:35.646
but love is what Esther twists.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.482
She will take the best
of your intentions,

28:37.483 --> 28:41.196
and she will use them
to get to my little girl.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.097
You waited too long

28:51.098 --> 28:54.459
before you came to rescue me.

28:59.400 --> 29:03.927
I won't make the same
mistake with hope.

29:10.231 --> 29:12.060
No.

29:14.318 --> 29:16.081
No, Klaus.

29:17.418 --> 29:19.317
I know you.

29:22.034 --> 29:25.574
You are not capable of this.

29:27.295 --> 29:29.786
That's the first lie
you've told me.

29:32.378 --> 29:33.665
Uh!

29:51.022 --> 29:53.622
Oh...

30:05.995 --> 30:09.618
It's late.
I should get going.

30:10.554 --> 30:12.089
Suppose you'll be wanting

30:12.090 --> 30:13.457
to get back to Marcel's.

30:13.458 --> 30:14.891
I lied to him about you.

30:14.892 --> 30:16.293
Probably go back to the attic.

30:16.294 --> 30:18.295
Voluntarily returning
to the jail cell

30:18.296 --> 30:20.998
where they locked you up.

30:20.999 --> 30:26.306
You must have been
lonely all that time.

30:26.307 --> 30:30.140
A witch needs a coven,
even if it is just two.

30:30.141 --> 30:32.813
When can we work on the dagger?

30:32.814 --> 30:35.143
Soon. We got some
more work to do

30:35.144 --> 30:38.772
with each other first.

30:41.976 --> 30:45.659
You're gonna like me,
Davina Claire,

30:45.660 --> 30:49.034
and I'm gonna let you
pretend a while

30:49.035 --> 30:51.868
that you don't already.

30:55.024 --> 30:56.992
Well, I staked it out.

30:56.993 --> 30:58.694
Looks like a couple
of Oliver's friends

30:58.695 --> 31:00.674
wanting to avenge his death.

31:00.675 --> 31:02.217
Where's Cami?

31:02.218 --> 31:03.904
She's tied up near the altar.

31:03.970 --> 31:06.096
Hey, you know what?
You beeline for her.

31:06.097 --> 31:08.141
I'll handle the rest
of them, all right?

31:08.142 --> 31:10.639
Aiden, your brother

31:10.640 --> 31:13.180
was among the recruits
that Oliver rescued.

31:13.181 --> 31:16.248
Was he not?

31:29.662 --> 31:32.098
[Thunder]

31:35.293 --> 31:37.571
Oh, no.

31:37.572 --> 31:39.207
[Crack]

31:40.464 --> 31:43.943
Camile! Camile!

31:46.716 --> 31:48.384
First, I'm gonna kick your ass,

31:48.385 --> 31:49.825
and then I'm gonna
take my pack back.

31:50.311 --> 31:51.151
Your pack?

31:51.152 --> 31:52.653
Last I checked, your pack

31:52.654 --> 31:54.223
was blindly following me.

31:54.224 --> 31:56.021
Want to talk about following?

31:56.022 --> 31:58.232
How do your mother's
boots taste, huh?

31:59.401 --> 32:03.269
Ha! What have you
done with Cami?

32:03.270 --> 32:04.870
Oh!

32:04.871 --> 32:07.237
Hybrids die by losing their head

32:07.238 --> 32:09.039
or their heart.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.877
Given the choice,
I'm gonna take the organ

32:10.878 --> 32:13.380
that got you into this
mess in the first place.

32:13.381 --> 32:17.125
[Chanting]

32:17.126 --> 32:20.332
[Gagging]

32:24.008 --> 32:27.225
Aagh!
Huh!

32:33.059 --> 32:36.014
Aagh!

32:40.406 --> 32:43.104
[Clank clank]

32:46.614 --> 32:48.915
[Sobs]

32:48.916 --> 32:51.740
You would've done the
same thing to me, Finn.

32:51.741 --> 32:54.655
[Chains rattle]

32:54.656 --> 32:57.123
Hey, are you ok?

32:57.124 --> 32:59.459
I'm so sorry I made you wait.

32:59.460 --> 33:03.380
Your timing was
pretty awesome, actually.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.698
Ha ha!

33:09.938 --> 33:12.209
[Elijah panting]

33:25.069 --> 33:27.278
We were innocent once, Elijah.

33:27.279 --> 33:29.529
We were innocent once, Elijah.

33:29.530 --> 33:32.575
[Panting]

33:32.576 --> 33:35.031
[Thunder]

33:36.539 --> 33:38.999
This bloodlust was
forced upon us

33:39.000 --> 33:40.974
by our parents,

33:40.975 --> 33:43.714
turning us from prey
to predator.

33:43.715 --> 33:47.168
[Thunder]

33:54.348 --> 33:57.600
We are the demons
lurking in shadow.

33:57.601 --> 34:00.270
We are the savage villains

34:00.271 --> 34:03.563
in fairy tales told to children,

34:03.564 --> 34:08.817
but not for my child,
not for hope.

34:08.818 --> 34:10.487
In her story,

34:10.489 --> 34:14.907
we are the knights
in shining armor.

34:14.908 --> 34:18.679
Without you by my side,
I don't think I can

34:18.679 --> 34:22.333
survive my own love
for my daughter.

34:22.333 --> 34:26.838
I need you.

34:26.839 --> 34:30.657
I need you, brother.

34:31.222 --> 34:33.096
The monster in me
can only be checked

34:33.097 --> 34:35.054
by the monster in you,

34:35.054 --> 34:37.348
by the monster in you.

34:37.349 --> 34:39.972
Only together can we
defeat our demons

34:40.478 --> 34:42.806
and save our family.

34:47.246 --> 34:50.414
[Thunder]

35:02.458 --> 35:05.580
Hraagh!

35:10.758 --> 35:13.088
[Panting]

35:21.541 --> 35:25.271
[Door opens and closes]

35:25.272 --> 35:27.350
We put Vincent in
the back of Josh's car.

35:27.858 --> 35:29.288
Is Aiden all right?

35:29.289 --> 35:32.792
Mm, some ice and
bourbon, he'll be fine.

35:32.793 --> 35:35.590
How'd you know where to find us?

35:36.158 --> 35:38.829
I spent a lot of time
tracking you when I was a wolf.

35:38.830 --> 35:42.742
Call it animal instinct.

35:43.905 --> 35:46.203
What do you mean?

35:49.208 --> 35:51.947
Oh, Ollie used to
give me so much hell

35:51.948 --> 35:54.347
for waiting on you.

35:54.348 --> 35:56.948
Oh, girls came and went,
but I always knew

35:56.949 --> 35:58.930
someday you'd come.

35:58.931 --> 36:02.058
See, our parents
had been so sure

36:02.059 --> 36:05.770
that you and I could
change things for the better.

36:05.771 --> 36:10.182
Jack, I think the girl
that you were waiting on

36:10.183 --> 36:16.132
was Andrea Labonair,
mythic revolutionary.

36:16.773 --> 36:18.783
You got Hayley Marshall,

36:18.784 --> 36:23.814
a knocked-up tomboy
with a bad attitude.

36:23.815 --> 36:26.350
You got dealt a crappy hand.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.001
[Chuckles]

36:28.002 --> 36:30.155
No. You're right.

36:30.156 --> 36:32.691
You're not the girl
I waited for.

36:35.997 --> 36:38.214
You're better.

36:57.725 --> 37:00.326
What is it?

37:02.028 --> 37:05.121
I spent the day with my father,

37:05.122 --> 37:07.827
my real father.

37:09.137 --> 37:11.673
Esther brought him
back from the dead

37:11.674 --> 37:13.308
believing he could convince me

37:13.309 --> 37:17.943
to renounce vampirism,

37:17.944 --> 37:20.816
and the thought
of what I could be

37:20.817 --> 37:24.224
had I been raised by him...

37:24.225 --> 37:28.811
I'd have been nurtured.

37:28.812 --> 37:32.560
This was his.

37:51.502 --> 37:53.623
He knew about hope...

37:54.429 --> 37:57.545
And I wanted to trust him.

37:57.546 --> 38:02.220
More than anything in
the world, I wanted to,

38:02.221 --> 38:04.074
but...

38:06.543 --> 38:10.603
Uh... I couldn't be sure,

38:10.604 --> 38:12.730
and I would never forgive myself

38:12.731 --> 38:14.186
if something happened to her

38:14.187 --> 38:17.105
because of my selfish
desire for a father.

38:19.460 --> 38:23.365
So I killed him.

38:23.366 --> 38:27.469
Without hesitation,
I killed him.

38:27.470 --> 38:30.575
[Music playing]

38:33.836 --> 38:37.125
You killed him for hope.

38:45.597 --> 38:48.595
Whatever innocence remains

38:48.596 --> 38:53.016
we must protect at any cost.

39:03.198 --> 39:04.777
[Sobs]

39:07.077 --> 39:08.573
[Sobbing]

39:50.207 --> 39:52.533
Yaah! Oh...

40:33.055 --> 40:36.528
Sorry.
We're closed.

40:36.529 --> 40:40.168
That's too bad.

40:40.169 --> 40:44.382
I hear you serve the best
Sazerac in town.

40:44.383 --> 40:47.042
Camile, isn't it?

40:47.553 --> 40:52.557
My sons have taken
quite the liking to you.

40:52.558 --> 40:55.430
[Chanting]

41:00.524 --> 41:03.484
How do you feel?

41:03.485 --> 41:05.960
The worst has passed...

41:07.063 --> 41:09.449
Though I suspect the nightmares

41:09.450 --> 41:11.134
are far from over.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.569
Well, gather your strength.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.071
After the message
I sent mother tonight,

41:14.072 --> 41:17.143
I expect hellfire to rain
down upon us imminently.

41:17.144 --> 41:19.079
We need to make a move
before she strikes.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.982
Marcel: Actually, moves were
made while you were sleeping.

41:21.983 --> 41:23.626
It's good to see you vertical.

41:23.627 --> 41:28.880
Marcel and I each left
a gift for you in the ballroom.

41:30.925 --> 41:33.468
You're welcome.

41:43.908 --> 41:46.569
Kaleb: Kidnapping.

41:46.570 --> 41:50.156
It's a rather unpleasant way
to begin a family reunion.

41:50.157 --> 41:53.905
Well, wait until you see
how we end it.
