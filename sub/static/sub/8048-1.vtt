00:58.000 --> 00:59.920
All right! Let's do it!

01:20.123 --> 01:22.883
- Hey, what's going on, man?
- I got that stuff, man.

01:23.363 --> 01:26.082
Here, kitty, kitty. Hey, you guys.

01:26.164 --> 01:29.683
Hey, Buford. Hey, Milady.
Come on. Come on.

01:29.764 --> 01:33.243
I've got breakfast for you. Come over here.
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:33.324 --> 01:35.204
Come on. Here, kitty, kitty.

01:35.285 --> 01:37.924
Agnes! Agnes, come on.

01:50.885 --> 01:54.444
Hey, Buford. Buford, look, look.
Look what I've got you for breakfast.

02:08.167 --> 02:09.727
Help! Help me!

02:11.049 --> 02:12.487
Get over here.

02:16.329 --> 02:18.247
Nothing personal, buddy.

02:26.371 --> 02:29.609
You've got to be sick of those
tired, two-month relationships.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.849
Problem is, you're not meeting
the right kind of woman.

02:32.050 --> 02:34.530
A woman who'll run with the wolves,

02:34.612 --> 02:37.049
somebody who'll at least
keep you interested.

02:37.131 --> 02:39.250
- Run with the wolves?
- Yeah.

02:39.331 --> 02:41.649
Man, I've told you about watching
too much of that Oprah shit.

02:42.812 --> 02:45.330
Come on, Pete.
A little excitement is not gonna kill you.

02:45.412 --> 02:49.212
Terry, I like the women nice, quiet and dull.

02:49.292 --> 02:51.132
You know what I'm saying?
Not like that Mongolian feminist

02:51.213 --> 02:53.091
that you set me up with.

02:54.013 --> 02:57.933
Okay, wait a minute. All right, who is it?

02:59.373 --> 03:01.212
- Who is who?
- Who is she?

03:01.293 --> 03:02.533
- What?
- Come on, come on, you know.

03:02.614 --> 03:04.254
Every time we start talking about
my sex life,

03:04.334 --> 03:06.813
it comes down to your wife trying
to set me up with somebody.

03:06.894 --> 03:08.894
- So, who is she?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...

03:08.975 --> 03:11.413
- This is your brother talking, G.
- Who is she, man?

03:11.494 --> 03:14.053
What? She, like, cook breakfast
with her toes or something?

03:14.133 --> 03:16.854
- What? I got to wheel her around or...
- All right, all right, all right.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.615
- Her name is Shanandra.
- Gesundheit.

03:19.696 --> 03:22.413
No, no, come on, dude.
Her name is Shanandra, G.

03:23.255 --> 03:24.935
What the hell is a Shanandra?

03:25.016 --> 03:27.135
I don't know, but she's bad, I'll tell you that.

03:27.216 --> 03:30.455
I am too old to be dating a Shanandra.
Something like...

03:30.937 --> 03:32.416
Something that comes out your nose
or something.

03:32.498 --> 03:33.936
Trust me on this one, G.

03:40.256 --> 03:41.616
Keep it up.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.818
Got a job to do here.

03:46.658 --> 03:48.897
Hey, Terry and Pete Nessip,
United States Marshals.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.977
May I have your ID, please?

03:51.738 --> 03:53.858
Okay, sir. Sign right here, please.

03:56.019 --> 03:58.539
Shanandra, sounds like a nightclub.

03:58.619 --> 04:00.258
Gordon Maples,
United States Attorney's Office.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.178
- Pete Nessip. This is my brother Terry.
- Pete, Terry.

04:03.258 --> 04:06.659
Remember when the DEA started
electronically confiscating drug money

04:06.740 --> 04:08.979
- from all the banks?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

04:09.060 --> 04:12.579
Dealers started to wake up in the morning
to find all their money gone.

04:12.661 --> 04:16.019
So, this guy Leedy was the big
computer wonk for the Chang Triad.

04:16.101 --> 04:18.500
He figured out how to hide their money
so we couldn't find it.

04:18.581 --> 04:21.579
You mean that guy in there,
coughing up furballs, is a genius?

04:21.661 --> 04:24.903
He breaks codes that can't be broken.
It's like he lived inside the computers.

04:24.982 --> 04:28.741
- How did he get caught?
- His ego. He felt unappreciated,

04:28.823 --> 04:32.222
so I cut him a deal to testify and kept him
out of sight for the last year and a half.

04:32.304 --> 04:34.542
Now, two weeks from trial, they found him.

04:34.623 --> 04:37.183
I need you guys to move Mr. Leedy
up to the pen in Atlanta

04:37.264 --> 04:39.542
so I can keep him alive
long enough to testify.

04:39.623 --> 04:42.903
What about the cats?
We don't have to take the cats, too, do we?

04:46.624 --> 04:49.144
welcome to Pac-Atlantic flight 611
to Atlanta

04:49.225 --> 04:51.423
with continuing service to Seattle.

04:51.505 --> 04:54.265
Please make sure that all carry-on baggage
is securely stowed...

04:54.346 --> 04:55.344
Whoops!

04:55.425 --> 04:58.625
It's okay.
That's what I'm here for, cat protection.

04:59.346 --> 05:02.264
Cat protection. Smooth, real smooth.

05:02.346 --> 05:05.824
Okay, tight enough.
Are you sure you've fed the cats enough?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.545
Agnes, she's got a little bit of a problem
with low blood sugar.

05:08.627 --> 05:11.226
Leedy, the cats will be better fed
than we will on this plane.

05:11.307 --> 05:13.066
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better, are you?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.746
- Now, why would I do that?
- What about the... How can we make sure

05:15.827 --> 05:17.948
they can maintain the temperature
in the baggage compartment?

05:18.027 --> 05:21.586
What if they freeze?
I gotta get down and see the cats. I want...

05:21.668 --> 05:22.987
- Chill, man.
- What if they freeze?

05:23.068 --> 05:24.068
Hey, excuse me.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.187
- Would you like an aisle seat?
- That would be great.

05:26.267 --> 05:28.868
Why are we not in first class?
We should be in first class.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.467
The pleasure's all mine.

05:31.227 --> 05:35.110
43 A and B. This is going to be great.

05:38.909 --> 05:41.468
I'm warning you. If anything happens
to those cats, I'm gonna sue you.

05:41.551 --> 05:42.828
You owe me, G.

05:42.909 --> 05:47.150
You've ever heard of punitive damages,
Mr. US Marshal?

05:47.230 --> 05:49.790
We should be in first class, anyway.

05:49.869 --> 05:51.390
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

05:51.470 --> 05:55.510
I'm afraid to fly. I need some water
to take a sedative.

05:55.590 --> 05:59.071
- Okay, no problem. I'll be right with you.
- Doctor... Okay, thanks.

06:32.836 --> 06:34.355
we're getting some heavy weather, folks.

06:34.435 --> 06:38.595
So I've got permission to climb to 38,000,
see if we can get above it.

06:39.036 --> 06:40.796
Bob, I think you'd better listen to this.

06:40.876 --> 06:46.076
Pac-Air 611 Bravo, this is Miami Approach.
we just received a code-red transmission.

06:48.757 --> 06:50.837
Would you care for some wine?

06:50.918 --> 06:54.357
Thanks, but I only drink wine
by candlelight.

06:54.436 --> 06:58.757
Well, I might be able to help you with that.
Would you like to follow me?

07:06.999 --> 07:08.518
Give me a break.

07:11.758 --> 07:14.398
The captain needs to see you
on the flight deck, right away.

07:14.479 --> 07:15.718
Yeah.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.439
- Gentlemen
- We just received this.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.840
Flight 611, you are about to be taken over
by Posse Comitus.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.120
- Stay on your flight plan.
- Oh, brother.

07:29.201 --> 07:30.359
No one will be hurt.

07:30.441 --> 07:33.160
You'll receive further instructions
in five minutes. Over.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.363
Hands up!

07:50.683 --> 07:53.801
Okay! Turn around, keep your head down.

07:54.483 --> 07:56.562
I said keep your heads down!

08:00.563 --> 08:01.523
Sit down.

08:07.804 --> 08:10.963
Nobody move, God damn it. If you do,
I'll blow this plane to hell. You understand?

08:11.044 --> 08:12.684
Get off the phone.

08:13.325 --> 08:15.003
You, too, God damn it.

08:15.445 --> 08:16.444
Get down!

08:16.526 --> 08:20.165
Get your heads down. Feet on the floor.
Hands out of pockets.

08:20.607 --> 08:22.286
You're not listening.

08:23.406 --> 08:24.685
Both of you!

08:25.207 --> 08:29.045
- Leedy, come with me.
- No, no, no! No, don't do this. No, please!

08:29.968 --> 08:31.126
Please don't.

08:33.006 --> 08:34.246
- How much time?
- Ten seconds.

08:34.327 --> 08:35.726
Wait for now.

08:43.448 --> 08:46.168
No, leave my hand. No, that's my finger!

08:49.089 --> 08:50.047
Jesus!

08:50.128 --> 08:54.770
Be good now. Be good boys and girls.
If you're not, I'll blow the plane up.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.969
- what happened?
- Number 1 is down!

09:00.330 --> 09:02.769
Talk to me! Talk to me, Number 1.

09:08.451 --> 09:11.570
I'm bulletproof. what are you? Hey!

09:12.850 --> 09:14.971
Help! Now!

09:24.732 --> 09:28.092
- What the hell?
- Shit! We're losing cabin pressure.

09:29.173 --> 09:33.213
Mayday! Mayday! This is Flight 611.
611 Heavy. Declaring an emergency.

09:33.293 --> 09:35.613
- We have emergency decompression.
...two and four.

09:35.693 --> 09:37.452
We're over Ocala, in Florida. We're...

09:59.376 --> 10:01.456
Go! Go!

10:19.419 --> 10:24.338
I've got you. Hang on. Okay, hold on to me.
Hold on. Okay.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.579
Okay, hold on. I've got you.

10:28.501 --> 10:30.058
Grab her. Hold her.

10:30.140 --> 10:34.138
- Lena, hold on. Hold on! I've got her.
- Okay. Okay.

10:42.061 --> 10:44.141
Terry, hang on. Hold on!

10:44.380 --> 10:46.181
Help me!

10:46.821 --> 10:48.259
Hang on, Terry.

10:48.620 --> 10:49.821
- Help!
- Hold on.

10:49.901 --> 10:51.661
I've got you. Hold on.

10:51.741 --> 10:53.981
Terry, you've gotta hold on!

10:54.742 --> 10:55.820
I'm slipping!

10:55.902 --> 10:58.022
- Terry!
- I won't let go of you!

11:00.183 --> 11:02.022
- Hang on to me!
- No! Don't...

11:02.103 --> 11:07.302
Terry! No!

11:07.383 --> 11:09.622
No, Terry! No.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.226
- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, FBI.
- Bob Covington.

11:52.308 --> 11:56.628
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.

11:56.708 --> 11:59.108
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.

12:03.149 --> 12:06.548
Pete. Pete, did you see anything?

12:10.869 --> 12:13.988
Two, three, maybe more.

12:16.230 --> 12:19.149
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?

12:22.870 --> 12:26.190
The little girl, I reached for her
and I grabbed her.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.231
And...

12:32.392 --> 12:36.192
They shot Terry. Motherfuckers.

12:38.632 --> 12:42.392
He was bad. He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...

12:42.473 --> 12:45.311
He was falling. I grabbed him and I had him.

12:46.313 --> 12:48.033
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.

12:50.034 --> 12:51.753
I couldn't hold him.

12:54.835 --> 12:56.753
Bring up the passenger list
and seating assignment.

12:59.955 --> 13:03.754
Okay, break down the ticket purchase
into cash and credit card.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.794
Cross-check that with advance purchase
and same-day purchase.

13:16.715 --> 13:18.436
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

13:18.517 --> 13:21.436
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.

13:21.516 --> 13:24.517
I'm trying,
but the whole system's going down.

13:33.038 --> 13:34.757
- It's Leedy...
- What?

13:34.838 --> 13:36.438
- It was a setup.
- A what?

13:36.519 --> 13:38.237
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?

13:38.319 --> 13:40.958
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?

13:41.039 --> 13:43.318
So, what did they do? Come down
and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?

13:43.400 --> 13:46.118
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.

13:46.198 --> 13:47.919
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- What about Leedy, now?

13:47.999 --> 13:50.719
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella
and floats down like Mary Poppins?

13:50.801 --> 13:53.120
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.920
Their heads were down
and the plane was filled with smoke.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.200
What 32 people did see was they saw your
brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.

13:59.281 --> 14:03.281
That's a lie! Wait a minute, what is this?
The FBI get brownie points for speed?

14:03.361 --> 14:06.161
We're talking about my brother here, man.

14:06.242 --> 14:08.120
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?

14:08.201 --> 14:09.920
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!

14:10.002 --> 14:12.322
Two hours after the explosion,
an airline maintenance man

14:12.401 --> 14:15.001
was gunned down at Miami airport
running away from MPD detention.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.122
And in his apartment they found
Posse Comitus literature

14:17.202 --> 14:18.602
and homemade C-4 explosives.

14:18.681 --> 14:20.441
The maintenance man
put the explosives on board?

14:20.523 --> 14:23.043
That's right. Detective Fox, Miami PD,
recognized the man

14:23.124 --> 14:24.281
from the pre-flight inspection.

14:24.362 --> 14:25.762
I'm telling you...

14:26.403 --> 14:30.321
Look, we all feel bad
about what happened to your brother,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.203
and don't nobody want to paint him
the fall guy. But the fact of the matter is

14:33.285 --> 14:36.682
your brother opened fire on that plane
and panicked, and 14 people are dead.

14:36.763 --> 14:38.244
My brother didn't panic.

14:38.324 --> 14:42.884
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID
on one of the remains found on the plane.

14:43.245 --> 14:44.964
Your prisoner, Leedy.

14:47.605 --> 14:48.725
Damn!

14:56.847 --> 14:59.565
Through the coordinated investigation
of federal, state

14:59.646 --> 15:01.526
and local law enforcement officials,

15:01.606 --> 15:04.327
the FBI believes that it has answered
most of the questions

15:04.408 --> 15:08.246
concerning the attempted hijack
of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.

15:09.648 --> 15:13.447
It was the Marshal on board
who set off the explosion. Is that true?

15:13.528 --> 15:16.808
That question has been raised
and is under investigation...

15:25.569 --> 15:27.050
Hey, guys!

15:27.850 --> 15:29.369
Guys, check it out!

15:30.050 --> 15:33.609
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.

15:33.689 --> 15:35.169
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.769
We went out that fucking door, that
wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.

15:37.850 --> 15:39.210
I'm dragging away from the jet,

15:39.292 --> 15:43.211
I come face to face with this woman, and
I swear, she was still holding a magazine.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.371
Has Leedy finished throwing up?

15:44.451 --> 15:45.692
- Yes.
- Good.

15:47.571 --> 15:51.372
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't! No! Don't touch my hand!

15:51.453 --> 15:53.211
- Watch out! Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!

15:53.292 --> 15:55.051
Don't touch my hand!

15:55.132 --> 15:56.933
Shut up and say thank you.

15:57.012 --> 15:58.052
- Thank you?
- Yes!

15:58.131 --> 16:01.093
You threw me out of an airplane
and you bit off my finger.

16:01.173 --> 16:04.971
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?

16:05.053 --> 16:08.534
You crashed the entire airline computer
system with one hand, didn't you?

16:08.615 --> 16:10.372
The information we have is
sketchy right now,

16:10.453 --> 16:13.614
but what we're hearing is that the Marshal
allegedly fired at a hijacker,

16:13.694 --> 16:15.495
and according to passengers,
set off the explosion

16:15.574 --> 16:18.532
which killed 14 people,
including the hijackers.

16:21.934 --> 16:24.494
Yes! Unload the boat. Unload the boat.

16:24.575 --> 16:27.015
...and a federal prisoner
by the name of Earl Leedy.

16:27.096 --> 16:32.216
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?

16:32.297 --> 16:36.056
You're not free. Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.

16:36.137 --> 16:37.776
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.

16:37.857 --> 16:39.135
What about the other Marshal
that was on the plane?

16:39.217 --> 16:40.256
He's dead. He's dead. I shot him.

16:40.338 --> 16:41.657
I don't think so. He was in the bathroom.

16:41.737 --> 16:44.056
Listen to me! All he saw was smoke.

16:44.138 --> 16:47.335
We got out clean, except for that bitch
that grabbed you, Jagger.

16:47.418 --> 16:50.417
Next time, you just get her
and throw her out the door.

16:50.498 --> 16:52.658
I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go. Breakfast.

16:52.739 --> 16:56.219
- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.

17:20.820 --> 17:23.060
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you. It's important.

17:23.141 --> 17:24.462
So is this.

17:24.862 --> 17:26.421
Wait till you see what I found.

17:26.502 --> 17:29.102
I got it nailed down
to a two-square-mile radius

17:29.182 --> 17:30.902
where the hijackers could've landed.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.341
We've got our bodies, Pete.

17:32.423 --> 17:35.063
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got
that are burned beyond recognition

17:35.143 --> 17:37.302
are those of the terrorists
and that prick Leedy.

17:37.385 --> 17:38.622
Does that make any sense?

17:38.703 --> 17:44.062
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747
at that altitude and speed and lives.

17:44.143 --> 17:46.303
- Period. You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.

17:46.384 --> 17:50.303
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.

17:50.384 --> 17:52.664
I'm telling you, it's a setup.

17:52.745 --> 17:56.463
Now all I have to do is figure out
how Leedy fits into all this.

17:57.025 --> 17:58.104
What?

17:58.626 --> 18:00.584
The Board of Review is looking at this
in two weeks...

18:00.666 --> 18:02.025
The Board of Review!

18:02.105 --> 18:04.785
...to determine yours and Terry's
responsibility for the accident.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.024
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.

18:07.106 --> 18:10.745
The FAA and the airline's in the middle
of a goddamn firestorm with the media,

18:10.827 --> 18:12.905
the insurance companies,
relatives of dead passengers...

18:12.986 --> 18:17.906
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!

18:18.746 --> 18:20.385
They're looking to point fingers
at somebody,

18:20.466 --> 18:23.627
and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?

18:26.348 --> 18:30.388
You know the SOP on this. I have
to ask you for your badge and your gun.

18:30.469 --> 18:33.188
- What? You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.

18:33.269 --> 18:35.949
Give me your badge and your gun, please.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.949
I don't care. I'm not quitting on this.

18:58.231 --> 19:00.150
I took a team out in a commercial jet.

19:00.230 --> 19:02.670
Delta Squad deployment,
hostage-drill scenario.

19:02.751 --> 19:07.551
- So it can be done?
- We did it. But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.

19:07.632 --> 19:09.871
And it was a drill, no explosions.

19:09.952 --> 19:12.831
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.

19:12.912 --> 19:13.991
Plus, you got another problem.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.953
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.

19:16.713 --> 19:20.431
You see this? You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.

19:20.513 --> 19:22.192
Now, your terrorists may have had

19:22.274 --> 19:24.033
somebody stash a few guns behind a seat,

19:24.114 --> 19:26.233
but not five parachute rigs.

19:26.314 --> 19:28.474
Five rigs going through X-ray
and metal detectors

19:28.554 --> 19:30.993
would raise holy hell with airport security.

19:31.075 --> 19:32.394
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.794
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.874
Mister, to even think about jumping
from a 747

19:37.956 --> 19:40.194
you've either got to be very skilled
or dick-brained.

19:40.276 --> 19:42.634
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?

19:42.716 --> 19:46.515
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.

19:47.196 --> 19:50.115
Dick-brained is his old partner,
Jess Crossman.

19:50.197 --> 19:51.236
Where can I find them?

19:51.317 --> 19:55.357
I don't think they jump together anymore,
but Crossman lives real close to here.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.318
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.319
- Do you know where I can find him?
- You must be with the class.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.440
Check upstairs.

20:30.519 --> 20:32.640
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem, dude.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.441
Be right out.

21:27.446 --> 21:28.606
Damn!

21:28.847 --> 21:31.326
- What was that?
- Can you believe that?

21:33.086 --> 21:34.367
Now you listen here to me.

21:34.446 --> 21:36.047
I hope you're good at fixing toilets,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.126
because you're never, ever gonna fix
another plane of mine.

21:38.207 --> 21:40.045
I got my new chute in.
You want to take me up later?

21:40.127 --> 21:43.729
I'll take your face off
if you don't come and fix this plane right.

21:43.809 --> 21:47.088
Where did you learn how to fix planes?
Mr. Goodwrench?

21:49.289 --> 21:51.727
This isn't a waiting room,
and the next load is booked.

21:51.809 --> 21:54.848
Damn. And I really wanted
to get on that plane.

21:54.930 --> 21:58.008
DEA, FBI or local?

21:59.771 --> 22:00.769
Jess Crossman.

22:00.851 --> 22:04.289
If you want to talk to me,
you're either a skydiver or a cop.

22:04.370 --> 22:09.010
And, well, you definitely don't look
like any skydiver I have ever seen.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.809
You know, cops, I don't like them.

22:14.730 --> 22:18.570
Every time you've met one
has been right after you've broken the law.

22:18.652 --> 22:19.770
Yeah.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.652
Did I go out of state
without calling my parole officer?

22:27.733 --> 22:30.412
Yes, I admit it. But it was an emergency.

22:30.812 --> 22:32.412
You're not here about a parole violation?

22:32.492 --> 22:34.772
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.972
Yeah. Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!

22:38.053 --> 22:40.053
What if it wasn't a screwup?

22:40.134 --> 22:42.134
What if someone just wanted
to make it look that way?

22:42.214 --> 22:44.894
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.

22:45.414 --> 22:46.574
A jump.

22:47.216 --> 22:51.013
A jailbreak from a 747? That's a cool idea.

22:51.895 --> 22:52.975
No offense.

22:53.056 --> 22:55.414
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?

22:55.496 --> 22:56.935
Why do you ask?

22:57.736 --> 23:00.655
Well, because people probably told you

23:00.735 --> 23:04.255
that Jessie Crossman was the only person
skilled enough to jump from a 747.

23:04.337 --> 23:07.336
Well, the actual phrase used
was "dick-brained."

23:08.297 --> 23:11.097
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.

23:11.177 --> 23:14.456
Look, some yahoo pulled
a John Wayne on that flight

23:14.536 --> 23:16.056
and got a lot of people killed, all right?

23:16.138 --> 23:19.697
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.

23:19.778 --> 23:21.897
Well, God. I'm sorry about that.

23:22.698 --> 23:26.538
But if I'm not a suspect,
then I don't have to talk to you, do I?

23:28.099 --> 23:30.018
You still haven't answered the question
about the jump.

23:30.098 --> 23:32.978
See, the longer I stand here,
the broker I get. So...

23:33.059 --> 23:34.058
You want to talk to me about jumping,

23:34.140 --> 23:37.738
you can pay like everyone else,
right, Mr. Cop?

23:38.300 --> 23:39.339
We'll see.

23:44.261 --> 23:47.219
What do I need this getup for
if I don't have a chute?

23:47.301 --> 23:49.620
It's my drop zone, it's my rules.

23:49.701 --> 23:52.421
Wait a minute, now.
You're not scared, are you?

23:53.422 --> 23:54.499
No.

23:59.421 --> 24:03.022
Hey, wait! Hold on! Wait for me!

24:22.065 --> 24:25.264
All right, give me a controlled exit
and a good arch.

24:26.385 --> 24:27.865
Ready, set, go!

24:33.585 --> 24:35.183
I don't get the attraction.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.385
You know, haven't you ever watched
a bird gliding on the wind

24:37.467 --> 24:40.225
- and wished you could do it?
- Yeah, for about 20 seconds.

24:40.305 --> 24:41.505
You know, you just don't get it, do you?

24:41.587 --> 24:43.986
What could be so difficult
about jumping out of an airplane?

24:44.067 --> 24:46.785
You count to 20,
you pull the damn string and that's it.

24:46.866 --> 24:49.026
Let the air sculpt your body position,
all right?

24:49.107 --> 24:50.507
Ready, set, go!

24:53.107 --> 24:54.667
- Yes!
- Jesus...

24:54.747 --> 24:56.867
Can you see the way the wind forces the...

24:56.948 --> 25:01.188
Come here. Can you see the way
the wind forces their bodies open?

25:01.267 --> 25:02.788
We're only at 80 knots.

25:02.869 --> 25:06.308
A 747 at 500 knots would
rip a jumper clean apart.

25:06.389 --> 25:09.348
And that, my friend,
is where the skill comes in.

25:09.428 --> 25:10.828
No big deal.

25:12.229 --> 25:15.349
You are way out of your league
up here, cowboy. Way out.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.229
I hear you talking all this stuff about skill.

25:17.310 --> 25:20.270
If you're so good, how come you're still
working in this shithole?

25:20.350 --> 25:21.349
What?

25:21.430 --> 25:24.750
What, you need to be hooked on phonics?
Shit hole. Shithole.

25:24.831 --> 25:25.869
Hey!

25:32.312 --> 25:33.910
He paid for one jump,
I might as well give him one.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.751
For Christ's sake,
just go get him, okay?

25:35.831 --> 25:36.991
All right.

25:49.794 --> 26:01.274
Help!

26:17.676 --> 26:20.595
Get off of me! Get off of me. You kicked me.

26:20.676 --> 26:24.556
Wait! Come back! Come back! Come back!

26:30.197 --> 26:31.916
- Help me!
- I've got you.

26:39.278 --> 26:40.558
You're crazy!

26:57.480 --> 27:00.081
- Hold still.
- Get me out of this.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.720
I thought you did okay.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.960
Welcome to the sky!
You fell, you lived, good start.

27:08.001 --> 27:12.081
Now you fell, you lived, I'm gone.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.521
You're out of your damn mind.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.761
There are things in here.

27:25.962 --> 27:27.003
Hey!

27:27.643 --> 27:30.642
Hey, I didn't know she was going
to do that, okay?

27:30.723 --> 27:32.243
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
I bet it was a whole lot safer

27:32.324 --> 27:35.442
than landing with you
in that damn plane of yours.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.882
Where can I find Don Jagger?

27:37.964 --> 27:39.723
There's a big jump this weekend
at Ocean Reef.

27:39.805 --> 27:41.763
All the hot ones will be there.
That's your best bet, man.

27:41.845 --> 27:43.003
Thank you.

27:43.083 --> 27:45.004
Skydivers are a real tight group.

27:45.085 --> 27:47.044
You're gonna have a tough time
breaking in by yourself.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.404
Well, I'll take my chances,
thank you very much.

27:49.485 --> 27:51.884
Hey, you know,
Jess didn't mean anything by that.

27:51.966 --> 27:54.924
Ever since Jagger went south on her
she's been a little touchy.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.805
What happened to Jagger?

27:56.886 --> 27:59.645
He says he got conned
into making some drug jumps.

27:59.726 --> 28:01.525
He did a little time. She did a little time, too.

28:01.605 --> 28:03.966
- They never patched things up.
- Why would she want to?

28:04.047 --> 28:07.446
She's loyal. I'd give her that much.
What do you think?

28:07.527 --> 28:09.846
I think it's time for you to zip it.

28:09.928 --> 28:14.086
And let's go on and get that rammerjammy
fixed on the tail, all right?

28:14.608 --> 28:16.568
- Nice jump, man.
- Yeah, right!

28:22.728 --> 28:27.688
Shit!

28:29.609 --> 28:31.049
I'll kill you.

28:38.370 --> 28:39.851
Please, don't push me.

28:42.290 --> 28:45.131
Don't let me... Wait. No, wait. No!

29:23.615 --> 29:25.215
- Nice landing.
- Good. Good.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.013
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

29:28.815 --> 29:31.214
Come on, come on, come on...

29:31.296 --> 29:33.134
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

29:33.935 --> 29:37.175
- I can't. I can't.
- Hit it, brother. Hit it, brother. Hit it.

29:37.256 --> 29:40.175
- I can't, I'm sorry...
- Leedy, do your job.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.976
I need a minute to steady myself.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.856
When we break in, we don't have minutes,
we have seconds.

29:45.937 --> 29:48.335
- It's the jump. Don't... It's the jump.
- Now, do it.

29:48.418 --> 29:50.218
- I can't think.
- Jump him until he can.

29:50.298 --> 29:53.017
Maybe he's had enough
for one day, all right?

29:53.098 --> 29:55.177
I haven't had enough for one day.
Jump him till he can, come on.

29:55.259 --> 29:57.256
- Please. I can't think.
- Come on. Up and at 'em.

29:57.338 --> 29:59.697
- Go! Come on! Let's go.
- Let's go. Up and at 'em.

29:59.779 --> 30:00.738
Come on, let's go.

30:00.818 --> 30:03.337
- I don't want to jump anymore!
- Come on, go!

30:12.020 --> 30:13.900
This is going to be a snap.

30:17.341 --> 30:18.940
God, this is easy.

30:20.980 --> 30:23.061
They're not going to know what hit them.

30:38.823 --> 30:40.902
- Hi, Joy Willins.
- I'm Pete.

30:40.983 --> 30:42.743
- Pete. Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.

30:43.342 --> 30:47.383
Miami Police. They've been really great.
Come on, Lena's around back.

30:47.704 --> 30:50.382
Look what I've got for you.

30:51.384 --> 30:52.423
Thank you.

30:52.504 --> 30:54.104
That's to replace the one
that you lost on the plane.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.584
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better.

30:57.145 --> 30:59.144
Lena, do you remember me?

30:59.746 --> 31:01.823
Remember that your tiger bumped me
upside the head

31:01.904 --> 31:03.905
when we were on the plane?

31:04.426 --> 31:06.064
Do you remember anything
about your plane trip?

31:06.145 --> 31:08.424
Maybe that there was something
strange happening,

31:08.506 --> 31:11.705
there was noise, yelling?

31:12.587 --> 31:17.466
No, I fell asleep and when I woke up
we were already landed.

31:17.787 --> 31:22.586
I'm going to show you some pictures and
I want you to look at them very carefully.

31:22.827 --> 31:25.146
This is the plane that we were on.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.627
Remember? Remember the plane?

31:28.948 --> 31:30.947
And then something went wrong.
Something happened.

31:31.028 --> 31:34.627
There was a loud noise.
There was a lot of smoke.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.748
- A big noise?
- A big noise.

31:37.828 --> 31:40.949
There was a lot of wind and
people were yelling and screaming.

31:41.949 --> 31:44.028
Do you remember if you saw anyone?

31:45.190 --> 31:48.509
Help me!

31:48.989 --> 31:51.270
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember anything about

31:51.351 --> 31:54.430
what he may have been wearing or... What?

31:56.151 --> 31:57.750
He wore glasses?

31:58.312 --> 31:59.551
He...

32:02.071 --> 32:04.912
The scar. He had a scar?

32:06.792 --> 32:08.472
Lena, was this the man
that you saw on the plane?

32:08.552 --> 32:10.311
You can tell me, nobody's gonna hurt you.

32:10.392 --> 32:11.950
Look, see, he has a scar.

32:13.831 --> 32:14.912
Is this the man?

32:14.993 --> 32:17.072
All right, okay. Look, look.
That's enough, okay?

32:17.152 --> 32:18.832
- That's enough. Could you please go now?
- See, he has a scar.

32:18.912 --> 32:21.111
- Was this the man you saw?
- Let's end it. I'm gonna get the detectives.

32:21.193 --> 32:24.152
- You can answer, it's okay.
- Detective Wallace!

32:25.193 --> 32:27.312
- That's all right. Thank you. Thank you.
- Please.

32:27.393 --> 32:30.633
- Thank you, Lena. I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's all right. That's all right.

32:30.712 --> 32:31.994
Yes!

32:36.836 --> 32:38.915
Detective Fox, Miami Metro.

32:38.994 --> 32:41.954
Concerning that plane accident
you're investigating.

32:42.035 --> 32:45.394
The other US Marshal on the plane
has acquired some information.

32:45.476 --> 32:47.594
- The other Marshal?
- That's correct.

32:47.675 --> 32:52.275
The young lady on the plane, she gave him
a partial ID of one of the hijackers.

32:52.636 --> 32:55.075
A scar under his right eye.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.715
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

32:58.798 --> 33:01.477
Not with you, with the other Marshal.

33:02.758 --> 33:04.996
Hang on, I wanna come with you.

33:29.319 --> 33:31.359
- Hey, Don.
- Hey.

33:34.239 --> 33:37.321
You're mine now. Where I go, you go.

33:37.402 --> 33:39.600
Let me go or lose me forever.

33:40.161 --> 33:41.679
I'm serious.

33:42.283 --> 33:45.120
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

33:48.042 --> 33:50.960
Hey. Ty, what are you doing?

33:51.762 --> 33:54.921
Hey, hey, let me go.

33:55.724 --> 33:57.442
What are you doing? Let me go!

33:57.522 --> 33:59.682
Hey! Hey! Damn it!

34:01.163 --> 34:05.162
Hey, God damn it! Let me go! Let me go!

34:07.804 --> 34:09.563
You son of a bitch!

34:10.284 --> 34:12.123
It's all over. Bye-bye.

34:12.204 --> 34:14.085
No!

34:33.446 --> 34:34.446
Cool move, papa.

34:34.527 --> 34:36.406
You see that?
9-1-1 is not gonna work for him.

34:36.487 --> 34:38.646
What you just saw there
can happen to any one of you.

34:38.726 --> 34:42.647
Our skydiving team is now four strong.
No problems with that.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.331
Oh, God.
Did you ever jump those round chutes?

35:10.410 --> 35:11.771
You can't steer the damn things

35:11.851 --> 35:14.049
and you never know
where they're gonna come down.

35:14.131 --> 35:18.291
I got enough branches up my ass
to start a pulpwood mill.

35:22.171 --> 35:26.091
Hi. I'd like... I don't know, maybe...

35:26.172 --> 35:28.852
A minute to wait for you to come back.

35:29.171 --> 35:30.971
- Look at this guy.
- What's he doing at our table?

35:31.053 --> 35:33.853
I don't think he gets it.
Let's explain it to him.

35:33.933 --> 35:35.293
Yeah.

35:35.373 --> 35:36.731
Here it goes.

35:37.692 --> 35:39.694
This is going to get messy.

35:42.934 --> 35:46.373
Hey, guys, I'm sitting in your seats?
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:46.454 --> 35:48.492
- Can I offer you a beer?
- Sure.

35:48.574 --> 35:49.933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:51.974 --> 35:53.214
Hey, hey, come on, man.

35:53.295 --> 35:56.495
If you wanted me to move,
you just should have asked.

36:03.055 --> 36:05.215
Jesus! Take it.

36:09.016 --> 36:12.375
Get these guys a beer. Get him a pillow.

36:14.498 --> 36:16.736
- Nessip.
- Bob.

36:17.337 --> 36:21.137
Nice to meet you, Bob. See you up there.

36:23.418 --> 36:25.737
Well, I see you've met some skydivers.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.178
You're not much of a cop,
but you sure do make friends easy.

36:28.259 --> 36:30.337
If you blow my cover, I'm gonna bust
your ass right back to prison.

36:30.418 --> 36:31.737
Do you understand me?

36:31.819 --> 36:34.819
Looks like you're doing a good job
of blowing your own cover.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.178
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Last time I did that, I got into a fight.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.779
Look, buddy, at the moment
we're the only cover you've got.

36:40.861 --> 36:42.258
Have a seat.

36:45.741 --> 36:49.259
Look, all I want to do
is talk to your friend Jagger.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.461
Okay, then here's what I want.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.179
There's a big exhibition jump
in DC next weekend.

36:54.261 --> 36:56.460
I want to go,
but my parole officer won't let me.

36:56.541 --> 36:59.501
- Keep talking.
- Well, see, you got a big problem here.

36:59.581 --> 37:02.140
The only way you're gonna learn
anything is if you hang out with the best.

37:02.221 --> 37:06.621
And right now, you're kind of sticking out
like a Cub Scout in a whorehouse.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.903
Bad news, man,
you're not gonna believe what happened.

37:10.983 --> 37:14.342
I reach your parole officer
and you work me in with these guys, right?

37:14.823 --> 37:16.541
And another thing...

37:18.783 --> 37:20.623
Burn in. Drinks up!

37:21.585 --> 37:22.582
Blue skies!

37:22.664 --> 37:24.624
- Black death!
- Black death!

37:26.785 --> 37:27.783
What the hell is that?

37:27.865 --> 37:30.904
It means some skydiver somewhere
burned in today.

37:31.585 --> 37:35.864
- What does that mean?
- As in, crash landed. Dead.

37:37.107 --> 37:41.105
They're gonna ring that bell and
raise a toast every hour till midnight.

37:41.186 --> 37:43.745
- Great tradition.
- Who hammered in?

37:44.826 --> 37:45.945
Jagger.

37:47.427 --> 37:48.426
Damn!

37:48.507 --> 37:50.747
The cops found him with a fat sack
of cocaine on him.

37:50.828 --> 37:53.347
He was stuck up in some power lines.

37:54.426 --> 37:55.747
Power lines?

37:57.146 --> 37:59.506
What, he just floated
into the power lines, Sel?

37:59.588 --> 38:01.987
It's just what I heard. I'm sorry.

38:05.349 --> 38:09.547
- No, that's not possible.
- Jessie, I'm sorry. Where are you going?

38:10.868 --> 38:14.349
If you want my help,
you pay for me and the airplane.

38:14.429 --> 38:15.868
- Okay, how much?
- $15,000.

38:15.948 --> 38:17.948
- $15,000?
- That's what it costs.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.989
What do you care, anyway?
It's the government's money.

38:20.070 --> 38:22.709
I don't work for the government anymore.

38:23.831 --> 38:25.630
I'll talk to you later.

38:28.071 --> 38:29.508
What's up, man?

38:56.194 --> 38:59.673
- Good news. Good news, Mr. Moncrief.
- What's that?

38:59.754 --> 39:02.674
Our client has found your offer
quite interesting.

39:02.754 --> 39:04.793
We're all just a little concerned
about the fact

39:04.875 --> 39:06.874
that you used to be an agent for the DEA.

39:06.954 --> 39:09.874
Used to be. Used to be is why
I'm worth something to you.

39:09.956 --> 39:14.233
Right, right, well your past
leaves a bad taste in our client's mouth.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.714
You have to do better than that.

39:16.796 --> 39:20.114
If the taste was bad, gentlemen,
you wouldn't be here.

39:20.876 --> 39:23.836
What I'm offering you,
no one else in the world can provide.

39:23.917 --> 39:25.274
No one else.

39:25.355 --> 39:28.556
I'm willing to prove it
by doing it one time for free.

39:29.036 --> 39:32.116
Then when we meet again,
you tell your boss to bring his wallet.

39:32.196 --> 39:33.756
Payment in full.

39:34.198 --> 39:35.797
Simple as that.

39:36.078 --> 39:39.076
Then we have a deal.
Thanks for lunch. Let's go.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.838
Go! You're up.

39:50.758 --> 39:54.039
I'm not ready. I'm not ready.
I'm not ready. I'm not ready!

40:49.684 --> 40:51.684
Torski, these are computers.

40:51.926 --> 40:54.004
- Silent movies for 400, please.
- Answer there...

40:59.566 --> 41:00.805
Who is Jackie Cooper?

41:00.887 --> 41:03.485
Coogan. Jackie Coogan, stupid...

41:11.168 --> 41:13.808
- We gotta go.
- Damn it. Give me some space!

41:18.009 --> 41:21.448
Hey, how are you doing?
I've got a surprise for you here.

41:31.369 --> 41:34.727
My God. Look at this.
Too bad we're not in the drug business.

41:37.049 --> 41:39.210
- Come on, Leedy.
- I've almost got it.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.529
- There.
- Where are you...

41:58.012 --> 41:59.291
Can I help with anything?

41:59.372 --> 42:01.532
You're making me nervous.
Would you just get away?

42:01.612 --> 42:03.611
You got two minutes, Earl.

42:11.094 --> 42:13.533
- What can I do to help you?
- I've got access.

42:13.614 --> 42:14.934
Good. Good.

42:16.253 --> 42:17.453
- I'm into the system.
- Yes.

42:20.974 --> 42:24.574
- Wanna run this up to the evidence locker?
- You got it, babe.

42:36.736 --> 42:38.174
Hey, Judy, Judy, wait up.

42:38.497 --> 42:40.815
Baby, don't come down here.

42:42.496 --> 42:44.257
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

42:45.377 --> 42:46.496
Hey.

42:50.977 --> 42:53.177
- The elevator's coming up.
- Roger that.

42:54.178 --> 42:57.937
- Earl, we have to close that now.
- Okay! Okay! All right, okay.

43:01.979 --> 43:03.137
Here they come.

43:04.740 --> 43:05.738
Look at him.

43:05.979 --> 43:09.138
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

43:09.539 --> 43:13.939
- We've got to go. Close it down.
- Don't rush me. They'll know we were here.

43:16.179 --> 43:18.859
You did good. Move it.

43:21.741 --> 43:23.381
Stay. Go! Go!

43:23.461 --> 43:25.619
- we're moving, Torski.
- Got you.

43:34.982 --> 43:35.941
Oh, yeah.

44:18.187 --> 44:21.146
God damn it!
Fucking Leedy threw up all over me.

44:23.147 --> 44:24.986
The daring late-night theft netted criminals

44:25.067 --> 44:29.267
over $50,000 worth of drugs
stolen from this protective enclosure.

44:29.348 --> 44:31.786
The thieves hid out
in the building's maintenance area

44:31.868 --> 44:33.748
until everyone had gone home.

44:33.828 --> 44:36.347
An intensive Internal Affairs review
is underway,

44:36.428 --> 44:40.268
since access to these areas is strictly
limited to station personnel.

44:40.350 --> 44:44.188
Reporting from Miami headquarters,
I'm Diana Morales. Back to you.

44:44.669 --> 44:47.909
I have to admit it, you're good, but so am I.

44:53.749 --> 44:55.908
Here come your Miami undercover agents.

44:55.990 --> 44:57.230
Finally.

45:04.431 --> 45:08.230
These narcs are walking around somewhere
thinking they're alive.

45:15.232 --> 45:17.431
Excellent. Thank you, carry on.

45:20.274 --> 45:22.871
So, is that it?

45:23.433 --> 45:26.152
- Am I done?
- No, a little while longer.

45:26.233 --> 45:28.633
Is this the Marshal, the other Marshal?
The one on the plane?

45:28.713 --> 45:30.633
- You told me you took care of him.
- Don't worry about him.

45:30.713 --> 45:33.073
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
The guy you killed is his brother.

45:33.154 --> 45:35.753
Leedy! I said don't worry about him.
I'll take care of my end of it, okay?

45:44.034 --> 45:46.833
- Radical.
- All right, man, right behind you.

45:47.835 --> 45:49.275
Yeah, I'm ready, man.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.318
- Where's your car?
- Don't ask.

46:17.398 --> 46:21.039
- Well, very, very cool bike.
- Air time.

46:23.358 --> 46:24.958
Where's my team?

46:25.039 --> 46:27.080
All right, all right, they're upstairs.

46:27.161 --> 46:28.519
- All right.
- Come on.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.120
Looking good, guys. Good formation.
That's great.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.440
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Jess.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.440
- How you doing?
- How you doing, baby?

46:37.521 --> 46:40.039
I'm getting together a team for the DC jump.
What about it?

46:40.120 --> 46:43.000
- Hell, yes. Are you kidding me?
- Cool. Have you seen Swoop around?

46:43.082 --> 46:46.601
No, not for a while. I heard that crazy
bastard was living on the street, though.

46:46.682 --> 46:50.160
Yeah, right. What else is new?
I think I know where he's at.

46:50.242 --> 46:52.121
We'll find him and Hockridge
and we've got ourselves a team.

46:52.202 --> 46:54.961
- I'm in. Good to see you.
- All right. Good to see you.

46:55.042 --> 46:58.362
Jess, come here.
Hockridge is out, he busted his ankle.

46:58.442 --> 47:00.042
- What?
- It wasn't even on a jump.

47:00.123 --> 47:02.002
He slipped getting out of the bathtub.

47:02.083 --> 47:03.921
But, you see, I figure I could take his place,
no problem.

47:04.003 --> 47:06.243
What have you logged, sweet pea,
a whole 20 jumps?

47:06.324 --> 47:08.363
Come on, Jess, when was the last time
you actually saw me jump?

47:08.444 --> 47:11.683
No, he is looking a lot better, Jess.
I've been giving him some extra air time.

47:11.765 --> 47:13.164
- He's good.
- You give me half the chance,

47:13.244 --> 47:16.523
- I'll slice the sky to pieces.
- Look, Selly, I don't need an Indiana Jones.

47:16.604 --> 47:18.485
I need somebody who's good
and who takes orders, period.

47:18.565 --> 47:21.484
Well, I like the kid's attitude.
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.

47:21.565 --> 47:25.005
I think he does, too, but enthusiasm can
get you killed up there. Thank you, Pete.

47:25.087 --> 47:29.166
- I can get Burt, he'll be here next week.
- No, I can't deal with Burt.

47:31.127 --> 47:32.644
Can I have your attention, please?

47:33.246 --> 47:35.285
All right, Selly, you're in.
But here's the drill.

47:35.368 --> 47:38.485
First of all, you're our mechanic,
so please keep the plane flying.

47:38.566 --> 47:40.966
Second of all,
if you hotdog on me, you're gone.

47:41.047 --> 47:44.926
And third, Winona,
keep a watch on the extra air time.

47:45.728 --> 47:47.326
Come on, let's go.

47:47.808 --> 47:49.887
I'm taking Pete, we're gonna go find Swoop.

47:50.447 --> 47:53.968
- Swoop? He's a nutcase.
- Swoop is cool. Swoop! Swoop!

47:54.049 --> 47:55.008
Swoop you.

47:55.089 --> 47:57.087
- I'm jumping, right?
- Jumping out of a plane?

47:57.168 --> 47:59.649
No, I need you alive
to deal with my probation officer.

47:59.728 --> 48:02.168
- Come on, Jess, I'm serious.
- So am I. I'm a good teacher,

48:02.249 --> 48:05.208
but nobody's good enough
to get you up to exhibition level in a week.

48:05.289 --> 48:06.929
Jess, here's the deal.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.569
Something tells me I'm not going to find
who I'm looking for down here, right?

48:09.650 --> 48:11.250
So, I gotta go up there.

48:11.331 --> 48:13.849
If I don't jump, we've got no deal.

48:14.970 --> 48:17.569
All right, you're an alternate, you train,
but you don't jump the exhibition.

48:17.651 --> 48:19.129
Way to go, kid.

48:24.571 --> 48:26.850
- Swoop.
- Why are we up here, again?

48:28.612 --> 48:34.532
Swoop!

48:36.932 --> 48:38.972
What the hell would he be doing
over there?

48:41.092 --> 48:42.332
Swoop!

48:43.613 --> 48:44.894
Over here.

48:48.134 --> 48:49.612
- Hey, Swoop.
- Hey!

48:49.694 --> 48:51.734
- What are you doing?
- Jeez.

48:52.014 --> 48:54.533
How about this, huh?
The fine folks of this building

48:54.615 --> 48:58.695
asked if I'd just come out here
and do a few windows, this and that.

49:00.136 --> 49:02.254
- I need you for a team, Swoop.
- Really?

49:02.335 --> 49:04.775
- Yeah.
- Yeah? How much does it pay?

49:04.856 --> 49:06.775
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

49:07.975 --> 49:09.815
All your jumps are paid for.

49:09.896 --> 49:12.375
So, how about those jumps, there, Jess,
are they paid for?

49:12.456 --> 49:14.735
- Yeah, they are.
- Didn't I just say that to him?

49:14.817 --> 49:19.176
Yeah, but if he hasn't jumped with you,
he won't talk to you. He won't.

49:19.257 --> 49:22.817
Well, I am going to have to require
a free T-shirt, Jess.

49:22.899 --> 49:26.776
- What? Can we get him a free T-shirt?
- Yes. Tell him he can have a T-shirt.

49:26.858 --> 49:29.336
- Okay. Free T, Swoop. Whatever you want.
- Yeah!

49:29.417 --> 49:31.577
- Swoop. Yeah.
- My lucky day.

49:31.658 --> 49:33.258
Here, give me a hand.

49:49.500 --> 49:52.139
All right! It opened.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.359
That ain't funny. That ain't funny, man.
Did you know about this?

51:01.916 --> 51:03.996
Find what you're looking for?

51:06.077 --> 51:10.595
- How long have you been following me?
- Ever since you decided to be my friend.

51:12.117 --> 51:13.916
What's this all about?

51:14.317 --> 51:18.676
When a skydiver burns in, the cops bring
the rig to a safety officer for inspection.

51:18.757 --> 51:20.714
- And this is Jagger's.
- And... What?

51:20.795 --> 51:22.877
There's nothing wrong with this rig.

51:22.956 --> 51:24.395
Which means
he would have had to screw up big time

51:24.476 --> 51:25.755
in order to float into those power lines.

51:25.835 --> 51:29.074
And there's no way that happened.
He had help.

51:33.554 --> 51:36.434
- Aren't these supposed to be metal?
- Yeah, it's a smuggler's rig.

51:36.515 --> 51:38.874
- A what?
- It's a smuggler's rig.

51:38.954 --> 51:41.833
Drug runners custom-make them
out of high-density fabric to escape radar.

51:41.914 --> 51:44.754
- There's no metal in them.
- Would these pass through airport security?

51:44.835 --> 51:47.633
- Yeah, probably.
- Damn!

51:49.754 --> 51:52.793
What? Pete!

51:57.795 --> 51:59.913
Put this back right where you found it,
all right?

51:59.994 --> 52:03.112
You listen to me, these people are killers.
You leave the cop stuff to me.

52:03.194 --> 52:04.553
All right.

52:12.393 --> 52:15.150
- Milton.
- Mike. wake up, Mike. This is Nessip.

52:15.231 --> 52:16.232
Pete. What?

52:16.313 --> 52:18.833
I got an envelope that I'm delivering to you
with a piece of nylon in it.

52:18.913 --> 52:20.631
I want you to examine it for explosives,
all right?

52:20.713 --> 52:25.111
Explosives? Nylons? Are you dating
that Mongolian feminist again?

52:26.193 --> 52:27.912
Look, I need your help on this, Mike.

52:27.992 --> 52:31.111
I thought you were on suspension...
Vacation.

52:31.193 --> 52:32.192
Suspension. You can say it.

52:32.271 --> 52:34.431
Yeah, I am.
That's why I need you to do this for me.

52:34.512 --> 52:38.950
Just examine it for explosives, alloys,
powder, whatever you can find. Anything.

52:39.031 --> 52:41.430
This is the Justice Department.
We don't have time for that.

52:41.511 --> 52:43.910
Mike, just do it, okay?

52:43.991 --> 52:47.509
All right. And don't tell them it's for me,
or else they'll fire your ass.

52:47.591 --> 52:50.709
Why can't you just be calling
to borrow money like usual, Pete?

53:14.869 --> 53:15.828
Hey.

53:17.149 --> 53:18.748
- Let's go.
- Go in.

53:22.349 --> 53:24.147
Come on! Get in there.

53:31.509 --> 53:33.147
Yeah, watch this.

53:43.868 --> 53:46.866
- He isn't balancing at all.
- Yeah.

53:59.586 --> 54:00.946
See?

54:49.904 --> 54:51.143
Beautiful!

55:08.422 --> 55:12.221
- Watch it coming down.
- I love it. Oh, yeah!

55:15.263 --> 55:16.781
Crash and burn.

55:22.221 --> 55:23.661
Oh, yeah!

55:24.542 --> 55:27.060
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

55:27.142 --> 55:30.661
I love it! I love it! What a ride! What a ride!

55:30.741 --> 55:32.221
Need for speed.

55:34.300 --> 55:36.860
That was great! That was great!
It was incredible!

55:36.941 --> 55:38.460
How did I do?

55:39.661 --> 55:42.619
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him. What's the deal?

55:42.700 --> 55:44.859
I don't think he counts
what you just did as a jump.

55:44.940 --> 55:46.859
He's kind of funny that way.

55:46.939 --> 55:48.419
Well, what kind of other jump is there?

55:48.500 --> 55:52.018
There's only one kind ofjump
and I did a sweet one, if I must say.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.775
My buddy, Luxem,
ran the lab on your nylon.

55:54.857 --> 55:56.254
This is serious guacamole.

55:56.335 --> 56:00.688
Look at this. He found C-4 explosive,
flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.

56:00.770 --> 56:03.045
I mean, you ain't dealing
with a cat burglar, Pete.

56:03.127 --> 56:07.159
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.

56:07.241 --> 56:10.716
No need, I promised him
you'd paint his house this summer.

56:44.235 --> 56:45.713
The chopper's aboard.

56:55.102 --> 56:56.339
Good to see you.

56:56.420 --> 56:57.816
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.

56:57.899 --> 56:59.096
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

56:59.177 --> 57:01.533
- Welcome. Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

57:01.613 --> 57:03.932
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample

57:04.009 --> 57:05.366
and decided we want more.

57:05.449 --> 57:07.486
There's only one way
you're gonna get more.

57:07.566 --> 57:10.520
Your price is rather large.

57:10.602 --> 57:12.200
So are the results.

57:12.759 --> 57:15.276
Good evening, everyone. Welcome aboard.

57:16.395 --> 57:19.151
I'm only interested
in long-term investments.

57:19.231 --> 57:23.703
What happens when the DEA
replaces their dead agents? And they will.

57:23.786 --> 57:27.140
You're buying a very sophisticated
data service.

57:27.221 --> 57:31.773
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in,
and we'll update you whenever they do.

57:34.292 --> 57:40.443
And the charge for this update?

57:42.403 --> 57:44.357
$2 million a month

57:44.440 --> 57:48.672
for the operations and names
of every undercover DEA agent in the world.

57:50.593 --> 57:52.148
What can I say?

57:53.629 --> 57:54.946
When do we see the list?

57:55.028 --> 58:00.139
The day after Thomas Jefferson died,
July 5th. God bless America.

58:05.252 --> 58:07.610
All right, settle down,
everybody, settle down.

58:07.691 --> 58:09.606
And welcome to DC.

58:09.688 --> 58:11.204
Yeah!

58:16.520 --> 58:20.793
The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna
tell your grandchildren about.

58:20.874 --> 58:23.389
We're jumping
into the city's fireworks display

58:23.471 --> 58:25.228
and coming right down in Potomac Park.

58:27.185 --> 58:28.585
That's right.

58:30.222 --> 58:31.739
Everybody settle down.

58:31.820 --> 58:34.454
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.

58:34.536 --> 58:37.731
Got Jack in the center
surrounded by a nine-way star,

58:37.812 --> 58:39.929
outside of that, a 24-way star.

58:40.010 --> 58:42.925
The judges today determine who gets
to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.

58:43.004 --> 58:45.922
You wanna be in a big fireworks show,
you'd better fly your butts off.

58:46.001 --> 58:47.799
You need 10 points or better to qualify.

58:47.880 --> 58:50.676
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!

58:52.593 --> 58:55.389
- Four hundred, 450. Something like that.
- No.

58:55.471 --> 58:56.947
- What kind of competition is that?
- A vicious competition, man.

58:57.029 --> 58:58.145
Ten points I gotta get?

58:58.227 --> 59:00.263
Hey, Swoop,
how did you fix in with this group, man?

59:00.344 --> 59:02.660
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right. It's all right.

59:02.742 --> 59:05.057
What are you, a comedian?
Why don't you fuck off?

59:10.450 --> 59:11.968
Nice landing, man!

59:15.285 --> 59:17.282
- You are bad!
- That's my man.

59:17.363 --> 59:19.120
My chute!

59:19.200 --> 59:22.276
- All right. All right. Okay.
- All right.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.632
Okay, that's 10 points for Moncrief's team.

01:00:11.959 --> 01:00:14.505
- That's 10 points for Crossman's team.
- Both teams qualify.

01:00:20.398 --> 01:00:24.379
Hey, Torski, watch your butt!

01:00:29.239 --> 01:00:30.791
Hey! Hey!

01:00:30.871 --> 01:00:32.820
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:00:35.687 --> 01:00:37.998
Hey, get the hell out of my face, man.

01:00:38.674 --> 01:00:42.376
- Hey! Hey, you, you son of a bitch.
- Merry Christmas, asshole.

01:00:45.803 --> 01:00:48.946
- Holy shit. What's that guy doing?
- It looks like a gift wrap.

01:00:50.858 --> 01:00:53.165
Rock and roll!

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.978
God damn it!

01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:11.482
Get away from me. Get away from me.

01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:15.383
Son of a bitch!

01:01:15.902 --> 01:01:18.528
Get away. No, get the hell away from me!

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.280
Bunch of assholes!

01:01:21.398 --> 01:01:22.908
High five.

01:01:22.989 --> 01:01:26.810
- Swoop! Swoop! Swoop! Swoop!
- Swoop! Swoop! Swoop! Swoop!

01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:46.001
Thank you.

01:01:54.842 --> 01:01:57.706
- Who's the guy with Torski?
- Ty Moncrief.

01:01:59.898 --> 01:02:03.201
He's military or something.
He shows up now and then for big jumps.

01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:14.987
I got to go strangle the weasel.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:16.460
You do that, Pete.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.490
- That guy was right.
- We'll mess things up.

01:02:21.837 --> 01:02:24.463
- Look who's here, Deucie.
- Knock yourself out, man.

01:02:24.544 --> 01:02:27.767
- Mr. Comedian.
- We're just jumpers, here.

01:02:27.848 --> 01:02:30.277
- What do you think you're doing, sport?
- Can't we all just...

01:02:30.357 --> 01:02:33.780
You think it's funny?
You wanna play with me?

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.891
You son of a bitch.

01:02:39.117 --> 01:02:40.788
How are you doing now, sport?

01:02:40.867 --> 01:02:43.495
You wanna do this?
You want to play with me, son?

01:02:43.576 --> 01:02:45.287
How do you like that?

01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:48.870
Shit!

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:51.100
- Yeah, the toilet's stopped up, man.
- Yeah?

01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:52.891
- Why don't you go use a tree?
- A tree?

01:02:52.972 --> 01:02:55.559
- Yeah, right there, see?
- Okay.

01:02:56.793 --> 01:03:00.299
That's okay. I'm sorry.
I'm environmentally conscious.

01:03:00.379 --> 01:03:02.806
Why don't you try this on for a while?

01:03:02.887 --> 01:03:04.039
Hey, man, none of this is
any of your business,

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.269
unless you want me to make it such,
so why don't you get out of here?

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.862
You fuck with my team, you fuck with me.

01:03:07.943 --> 01:03:10.093
Hey, fuck you and fuck your team.

01:03:18.652 --> 01:03:20.682
I look out for everyone.

01:03:31.832 --> 01:03:33.543
Come on. Come on.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:53.530
Swoop. Swoop. Watch your head. Come on.

01:03:54.726 --> 01:03:56.000
What?

01:04:00.977 --> 01:04:02.728
So, what about this Ty Moncrief?

01:04:02.808 --> 01:04:05.912
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them
three years ago. Thanks.

01:04:05.994 --> 01:04:08.103
Is he good enough to be
one of the people I'm looking for?

01:04:08.184 --> 01:04:12.204
If I find out that he killed Jagger,
it won't matter how good he is.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.185
Well, why would he risk showing his face
around here?

01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:19.370
I mean, what's so special
about this DC jump?

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:23.790
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete,
it's the biggest thing in the world.

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:25.582
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.

01:04:25.663 --> 01:04:28.569
Any other day,
it's the most restricted air space.

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:32.550
That's why every skydiver worth his ass
wants in on this load.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:36.412
- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.

01:04:37.447 --> 01:04:39.676
Please. Thank you.

01:04:42.106 --> 01:04:44.136
It's right there,
right by the Washington Monument.

01:04:44.217 --> 01:04:46.206
You mean a jumper could put down
anyplace he wanted to?

01:04:46.286 --> 01:04:49.910
I myself am going to make a landing
right in Abe Lincoln's lap.

01:04:51.344 --> 01:04:54.010
Jess, you tell the new guy, "Thanks."

01:04:56.281 --> 01:04:57.674
Thanks.

01:04:57.754 --> 01:05:00.541
Yeah, tell him, "Anytime."
I enjoyed it.

01:05:01.575 --> 01:05:03.486
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:04.684
All right, see you, guys.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.502
That's him. That's what
I've been trying to tell you all along.

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:18.894
- I know. I know.
- And I'm telling you,

01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:20.287
we'd better take this son of a bitch out

01:05:20.369 --> 01:05:21.801
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:05:21.882 --> 01:05:25.744
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.

01:05:26.461 --> 01:05:29.049
We keep their team on the ground,
they'll never touch us.

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:33.188
- I see. So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.

01:05:34.704 --> 01:05:35.895
Crossman.

01:05:39.482 --> 01:05:41.510
This is Jessie's trailer.

01:05:57.198 --> 01:05:59.586
Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.

01:06:06.794 --> 01:06:07.750
Have a nice trip.

01:06:13.284 --> 01:06:17.264
Patrick, get this off to Chicago
and wait for the fax. It's number six.

01:06:17.344 --> 01:06:18.617
Tom.

01:06:18.698 --> 01:06:21.406
- Holy shit. What the hell happened to you?
- I've got to talk to you.

01:06:21.487 --> 01:06:24.431
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.

01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:27.975
Working undercover while on suspension
violates your sworn oath.

01:06:28.056 --> 01:06:29.728
Not to mention 20 different laws.

01:06:30.525 --> 01:06:33.309
- Me accessing his file makes it 21.
- I'm in the middle of them.

01:06:33.391 --> 01:06:35.658
As a matter of fact,
I found one of the chutes from the 747.

01:06:35.739 --> 01:06:38.048
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:40.079
If you've got evidence,
make your case to the FBI.

01:06:40.159 --> 01:06:44.060
You're going to have to do better than this
Ty Moncrief fellow. He's DEA. See that?

01:06:44.697 --> 01:06:47.763
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.

01:06:49.435 --> 01:06:52.542
I'll bring his service record up
so you can see it.

01:06:53.896 --> 01:06:56.085
What the hell's going on
with this computer?

01:06:57.757 --> 01:06:58.912
Leedy.

01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:01.659
Peter. Pete!

01:07:08.189 --> 01:07:10.259
Okay, folks, check it out. Demo jumpers,

01:07:10.339 --> 01:07:13.921
we've got about a 12-minute call
to dress rehearsal. Twelve-minute call.

01:07:14.001 --> 01:07:16.469
Let's nail this one, puppies.
we've gotta nail this one.

01:07:18.582 --> 01:07:21.448
- Guys, has anyone seen Nessip?
- Who? No.

01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:22.920
Pete. No.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.219
What's your problem, ace?

01:07:28.337 --> 01:07:29.849
What's the matter, sweet pea?

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:31.600
Nothing, I mean, I'm not the pro here,

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.874
I don't want to be the one
to screw things up.

01:07:32.955 --> 01:07:35.701
Sel, you're not going to screw anything up.

01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:41.832
Listen to me. This rig, it logged two world
titles for Jagger and one for me, all right?

01:07:41.913 --> 01:07:42.987
You wanna wear this?

01:07:43.068 --> 01:07:44.381
This mean I don't have to wear
that stupid helmet?

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:48.679
Sel, no, you don't gotta wear
the stupid helmet. How's that, all right?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.464
- Yeah! Let's jump!
- The star!

01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:05.275
- I'm ready.
- Hold on, hotdog.

01:08:15.301 --> 01:08:17.064
- Time to go.
- Come on, let's go.

01:08:17.145 --> 01:08:18.988
- Let's get out there.
- Do it!

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.173
Shit. Somebody didn't open.

01:09:18.219 --> 01:09:20.421
Selkirk, cut away. Damn it.

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:22.227
Cut away.

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:24.511
I can't get it.

01:09:30.568 --> 01:09:31.970
Cut away.

01:09:41.194 --> 01:09:42.598
4,000 feet.

01:09:54.268 --> 01:09:56.311
Swoop, get him. God damn.

01:10:00.925 --> 01:10:02.768
- Two grand. Pull it!
- Pull it!

01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:05.295
- Pull it.
- Pull it.

01:10:18.328 --> 01:10:19.848
Come on, pull. Come on.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.040
Paramedics to the water area now!

01:11:00.007 --> 01:11:01.886
We need a medic over here.

01:11:06.768 --> 01:11:09.087
- God, what happened to him?
- It's not good.

01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:13.450
Sel, can you hear us? Please.
God damn it, get this off him.

01:11:13.529 --> 01:11:16.288
- Stay with us, Selly.
- Oh, Bobby, he's not breathing.

01:11:16.368 --> 01:11:19.049
- He's not breathing.
- He tried to pull it, it just wouldn't work.

01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:21.570
- God. Get up!
- Here we go.

01:11:23.811 --> 01:11:27.652
Get us a medic, God damn it.
Stay with us, Selly.

01:11:30.174 --> 01:11:32.573
- I hear it. I hear it.
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:35.414
Selkirk, buddy.

01:11:35.654 --> 01:11:37.534
- He's breathing. He's breathing.
- There you go.

01:11:37.616 --> 01:11:39.616
- He's breathing.
- Look out, let me in here.

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.217
- Look out. You all right?
- He's breathing.

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:43.575
Okay. Good job. Good job.

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.301
- You're going to be okay.
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.701
- Can you hear me?
- It's okay.

01:12:22.707 --> 01:12:24.146
- Sel.
- Take it easy.

01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:26.585
- We're right here, buddy.
- Sorry, guys, but you can't stay in here.

01:12:26.666 --> 01:12:28.348
We're going to stay right here with you,
buddy, all right?

01:12:28.429 --> 01:12:30.466
You can meet us at the hospital,
but nobody rides in the van.

01:12:30.548 --> 01:12:31.907
- Bullshit, we're family.
- Nobody.

01:12:31.988 --> 01:12:35.308
Hey, guys, don't worry about it, right?
You guys have gotta jump anyway.

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:38.949
Get the hell out of here.
Just tell Jess her rig's broken.

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.230
All right, man, we'll see you at the hospital.

01:13:06.879 --> 01:13:08.757
Where the hell is Jessie?

01:13:11.318 --> 01:13:13.638
Winona, let's get this plane in the air.
We're going after Ty's plane.

01:13:13.719 --> 01:13:15.358
- Who's this?
- I'm a US Marshal.

01:13:15.439 --> 01:13:16.557
Now, you can read about it later.

01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:19.879
No way, later. We're going.
Come on. Crank it up.

01:14:01.092 --> 01:14:04.970
- I want to jump!
- Okay, let's go.

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:08.370
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go!

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:20.734
Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!

01:14:20.816 --> 01:14:22.414
Bye-bye.

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:26.016
Let's go. Chutes on. Let's go.

01:14:26.096 --> 01:14:27.618
Here we go.

01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:12.467
We're so close to pulling this off.
All you have to do...

01:15:12.669 --> 01:15:14.068
Hey, surprise!

01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:19.229
Only one of you really has to die.
So tell me, who killed Jagger?

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:20.549
How about me? You wanna try me?

01:15:20.632 --> 01:15:22.630
You come here, I'll shoot you
right in between the fucking eyes!

01:15:22.711 --> 01:15:24.031
Jesus, Jessie, bad idea...

01:15:24.111 --> 01:15:26.272
You look like a little boy
without a chute, Jessie.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:31.074
- I knew it was you, Ty.
- Stay there.

01:15:31.154 --> 01:15:32.112
You don't know what you're doing.

01:15:32.193 --> 01:15:33.793
No.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.

01:15:33.874 --> 01:15:35.633
Let me tell you about Jagger.
He betrayed you.

01:15:35.714 --> 01:15:38.513
He left you in prison to rot like jailbait.
This is his girlfriend.

01:15:38.593 --> 01:15:40.636
You meant nothing to him. He's dead.
You're on the wrong...

01:15:40.716 --> 01:15:41.915
Sit down.

01:15:43.395 --> 01:15:45.316
Get off of me.

01:15:45.396 --> 01:15:48.394
- Get off.
- Throw her out.

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.156
Throw her out.

01:15:50.959 --> 01:15:53.398
Jump. Jump, Jessie, I dare you.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.799
- Oh, shit.
- Jess.

01:15:57.439 --> 01:16:01.520
- She's got a lot ofjuice.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no wings, man.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.601
Let's go, get our chutes on.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:14.946
We've lost them.

01:16:16.107 --> 01:16:18.233
They sure as hell weren't tracking
for the fireworks.

01:16:18.312 --> 01:16:20.037
I know where Ty's headed.

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:22.964
He's going to the DEA building.
Right near the drop zone.

01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:25.331
- Should I radio for backup?
- Yeah, right.

01:16:25.412 --> 01:16:27.778
First they'll laugh at you,
then they'll throw your ass in jail.

01:16:51.642 --> 01:16:53.325
Jesus, Mary, priest!

01:16:56.814 --> 01:16:58.138
Jessie.

01:16:59.543 --> 01:17:02.991
She's hanging on the footrail.
What the hell is she doing?

01:17:04.677 --> 01:17:08.205
I know exactly what she's doing.
It's the only trick I know.

01:17:30.382 --> 01:17:33.390
- Swoop, what are you doing?
- I'm not going to miss this.

01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:01.106
...reveals nothing.

01:18:01.187 --> 01:18:05.555
I suggest his mind has been so conditioned
as part of a preconceived plan.

01:18:05.638 --> 01:18:07.803
God damn, look at this dweeb.

01:18:08.485 --> 01:18:12.014
You think by the 23rd century
they'd have better toupees than that.

01:18:12.095 --> 01:18:15.503
- They all wear wigs on that show.
- Not Spock.

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:19.834
- He got the ears.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.427
All clear up here.
I'm going to the 19th floor.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.141
Little power hit.

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.380
Probably burning down the kitchen again.

01:18:52.463 --> 01:18:54.783
Joanne, are you cooking again?

01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:56.265
we've had a couple power spikes.

01:18:56.345 --> 01:18:59.386
No, you guys want to order a pizza?
I'm starving.

01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:04.792
All right, we're in.

01:19:07.835 --> 01:19:09.275
- Radio check.
- One.

01:19:09.356 --> 01:19:11.035
- Two.
- Three.

01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:44.661
Clear.

01:19:58.993 --> 01:20:00.394
Not now.

01:20:00.474 --> 01:20:04.516
There is no logic in Thelev's attack
upon the Captain. There is no logic...

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.720
Okay.

01:20:21.972 --> 01:20:23.852
- Is it going to work?
- It's going to work.

01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:24.930
Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:27.894 --> 01:20:29.616
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:20:32.418 --> 01:20:35.422
- Leedy. Earl. Earl!
- Leedy, quickly.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.981
Where are you? Come on.

01:21:08.688 --> 01:21:10.766
- We're all clear.
- Good.

01:21:15.452 --> 01:21:17.452
Okay, we're into the game.

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:27.459
Come on.

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:40.629
How smart can one man be?

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:46.033
Jimmy Sansome, Jesus Christ,
that guy used to hit on me.

01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:47.075
This guy's a Fed?

01:21:47.156 --> 01:21:51.997
- Deuce, run code blue. Are you ready?
- Yeah, copy, Ty. I'm ready to rock and roll.

01:21:55.081 --> 01:21:56.641
It's cool up here. The chutes are ready.

01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:06.888
- What the...
- Look out!

01:22:16.175 --> 01:22:18.499
What's the matter, you can't fly?

01:22:23.663 --> 01:22:26.503
Swoop, get away from the door. Follow me.

01:22:26.586 --> 01:22:28.346
Come on, get him up.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.960
You're dead, dead.

01:23:07.133 --> 01:23:08.414
Thank God!

01:23:10.536 --> 01:23:14.894
Listen up. Stage 1 is completed.
Stay focused, we're right on schedule.

01:23:15.896 --> 01:23:17.818
Yeah. Well, the schedule's gonna change.

01:23:18.498 --> 01:23:20.817
- Come on. Are you okay?
- There you go.

01:23:20.899 --> 01:23:23.420
- Swoop, stay here. Don't rob him, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:25.781
- I'm going for help.
- Okay, easy, take it easy. Easy.

01:23:25.861 --> 01:23:27.622
She's going for help.

01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:50.310
What the hell?

01:23:51.553 --> 01:23:53.153
Joanne, come back to me.

01:23:53.234 --> 01:23:54.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you.

01:23:55.074 --> 01:23:57.396
Joanne, we've got a circuit trip,
says a washer trolley is moving.

01:23:57.474 --> 01:23:58.915
Check it out, will you?

01:23:58.995 --> 01:24:01.917
Hi, we might be under attack from Klingons.

01:24:01.998 --> 01:24:04.678
Maybe they got food. Okay, I'm on my way.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.439
I'll be back.

01:24:15.582 --> 01:24:17.778
Ty, the elevator's moving.

01:24:18.459 --> 01:24:20.497
Stop it on this floor.
I'm coming to meet you.

01:24:20.576 --> 01:24:22.132
Stay with Leedy.

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:39.431
Hey!

01:24:39.514 --> 01:24:41.908
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Give him the gun, give him the gun.

01:24:41.991 --> 01:24:45.025
It's okay, don't panic. Why don't you
radio down and tell them everything's fine,

01:24:45.107 --> 01:24:47.541
you're okay? Tell them you're fine.

01:24:49.262 --> 01:24:51.181
Nothing going on up here.

01:24:51.499 --> 01:24:53.657
We're still getting
a washer-trolley signal, though.

01:24:53.738 --> 01:24:56.850
- Probably just a short.
- Roger. Yeah, thank you.

01:24:56.931 --> 01:24:58.490
You're dismissed.

01:25:00.687 --> 01:25:02.125
You take care of her. I'm letting them know.

01:25:09.197 --> 01:25:10.554
Oh, my God!

01:25:20.024 --> 01:25:22.382
- Fuck!
- What? Whoa!

01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:27.455
God damn it! You go up on the roof.

01:25:27.534 --> 01:25:31.609
Kara, check the floor. I'm coming
with Leedy. I'm with the magician.

01:25:31.689 --> 01:25:34.208
You're on the roof. I need you.
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:25:34.289 --> 01:25:38.481
- All right, Leedy, I'm right outside.
- What? Where are you going? Hey!

01:26:13.865 --> 01:26:15.302
I'm calling for backup.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.035
Call the fire department, too.
We got smoke on the 20th floor.

01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:18.144
Right.

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:24.083
Close it out. Close it out. Now!

01:27:07.835 --> 01:27:09.865
- Ty...
- You little... God damn it.

01:27:10.419 --> 01:27:11.489
Kara.

01:27:13.517 --> 01:27:16.871
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Ty, get off me.

01:27:18.718 --> 01:27:20.746
Come on. Come on, go, go.

01:27:30.782 --> 01:27:33.142
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay, I'll be right nearby.

01:27:33.218 --> 01:27:35.763
- Right nearby, okay?
- All right. All right.

01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:40.816
Jessie?

01:27:43.068 --> 01:27:45.204
Jessie, what do you want me to do?

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:36.130
- Leedy, don't you move.
- What?

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.410
Wait, wait. No, wait, wait.

01:28:37.492 --> 01:28:38.772
- Don't move.
- You got them. You got them.

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:42.739
You've got them on hijacking, murder,
smuggling, kidnapping, cruelty to animals.

01:28:42.819 --> 01:28:45.583
Look what they did to me.
They took my finger...

01:28:45.664 --> 01:28:48.146
Thought you'd get away from me, huh?

01:28:48.225 --> 01:28:52.272
Earl. Earl, you disappoint me.
They're going to put you away if you go in.

01:28:52.352 --> 01:28:53.432
Who's your friend?

01:28:53.513 --> 01:28:55.318
Look, I was just trying to stall them for you.

01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:57.639
You're the reason your little brother's dead,
you idiot.

01:28:57.721 --> 01:28:59.000
Families shouldn't fly together.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.125
That's all right, you'll meet him again.
I guarantee that.

01:29:01.206 --> 01:29:02.446
And when you do,
he's gonna bust your ass.

01:29:02.526 --> 01:29:04.729
You try and stop me, or bring me
somewhere, you're fucked!

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:08.012
He's bluffing, Jessie.
He needs this little bastard.

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.455
Don't you think about it!

01:29:09.536 --> 01:29:10.735
Shoot him, shoot him dead!

01:29:10.817 --> 01:29:13.218
Freeze! Drop your weapons.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.982
I said drop them!

01:29:29.561 --> 01:29:32.283
Leedy? Leedy!

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.623
Shit!

01:31:29.836 --> 01:31:33.720
Oh, Jesus. Look, guys,
is this really necessary? I'm not that hurt.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:36.930
You know, I've been through worse
than this before.

01:31:37.168 --> 01:31:38.555
I will personally write the President

01:31:38.636 --> 01:31:40.973
and recommend that you receive
commendation for your actions.

01:31:41.053 --> 01:31:43.551
Now, if you'll just maintain your stations
here, and secure this location,

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:44.819
I'll be checking the rest of the area.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.444
- Jerry.
- Dupont, Ted.

01:31:46.523 --> 01:31:48.585
- Yes, very good work.
- With a "J."

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:58.929
Leedy. Leedy.
Leedy, you come back here. Leedy.

01:31:59.009 --> 01:32:01.904
Leedy. Stop that guy. Stop.
The one with the bozo hairdo.

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:03.805
Leedy. Jesus, listen to me. Listen to me.

01:32:03.884 --> 01:32:05.511
He's wearing a DEA jacket. Stop...

01:32:05.591 --> 01:32:08.482
Leedy, you come... Leedy!
Leedy! Stop that guy.

01:32:09.118 --> 01:32:10.305
No way.

01:32:10.624 --> 01:32:13.438
Don't make me roll after you.
You better not make me roll after you.

01:32:13.518 --> 01:32:14.903
Yeah, that guy right there.
He's one of the bad guys.

01:32:30.722 --> 01:32:32.464
Fucking awesome, man.

01:32:34.249 --> 01:32:35.835
Way to go, Swoop!

01:32:40.273 --> 01:32:41.978
Hey, man, it's the other leg, man.

01:32:42.058 --> 01:32:43.921
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.

01:32:44.001 --> 01:32:47.486
Pete! Hi, Pete, are you all right?

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:48.954
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:53.473
Well, you jumped, you lived.
That's a good start.

01:32:54.226 --> 01:32:58.109
Yeah. Maybe in another 40 or 50 years
I'll try it again.

01:32:59.498 --> 01:33:01.718
Pete! Pete, Pete, Pete.

01:33:03.146 --> 01:33:05.643
- Swoop!
- Hey, Pete, Pete.

01:33:05.722 --> 01:33:08.418
- Listen, talk to these guys, okay?
- We want to help you.

01:33:08.496 --> 01:33:11.469
Okay? Tell them that my leg is broke, okay?

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.710
Anything you want, Swoop.
Anything you want, brother.
