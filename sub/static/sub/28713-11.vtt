00:43.627 --> 00:45.368
Yeah, but where are you?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.534
Strand?

01:27.963 --> 01:31.172
Strand? Strand?

01:37.180 --> 01:40.264
Strand!

02:09.253 --> 02:10.253
You all right?

02:15.302 --> 02:16.543
I'm sorry.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.215
I'm sorry.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.139
Don't be. I should've been closer.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.379
You ever get the feeling the universe
is trying to tell you something?

03:47.644 --> 03:50.512
Hey, we're running low on fuel.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.097
We'll need to circle back
with the rest of the convoy.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.691
You don't think we'll find them.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.105
Even if we do, I'm not sure that Picasso's
gonna be able to do for you what you hope.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.696
And further, I'm not sure it's good
for you to be out here.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.453
I know.

04:10.542 --> 04:14.502
So, what is it you think this person's
gonna do for you that we can't?

04:16.380 --> 04:17.916
I'm not sure.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.084
I just know how I feel
when I see those trees.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.633
<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

04:29.853 --> 04:32.436
<i>I repeat, is anybody there?</i>

04:32.522 --> 04:34.309
Don't tell him where we are.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.481
We copy.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.810
<i>Who is this?</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:41.396
You go first.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.445
<i>Alicia?</i>

04:44.534 --> 04:45.820
He saw the tapes.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.736
You saw the tapes?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.497
<i>Mitch? Is that you?</i>

04:51.583 --> 04:53.620
It's Victor.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.576
What's your name?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.081
How may we assist you?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.665
Name's Wes.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.171
You owe me a ride.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.603
What happened to your bike?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.184
I don't know.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.862
All these little holes just
spontaneously erupted.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.991
Some assholes did it.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.285
Thought I was with you people.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.350
Right after I saw your movie,
I wound up in the movie,

05:32.374 --> 05:33.455
so thanks for that.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.246
Logan.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.755
Friendly guy. Big fan of yours.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.682
Which is why
we can't stick around here jawing.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.592
He may have heard us on the radio.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.302
- Why didn't you call us sooner?
- I didn't think that tape was real.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.133
We can assure you it is.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.096
People who make a show
of all the good shit they do

05:56.189 --> 05:57.851
are usually full of the other kind.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.307
We're here, aren't we?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.394
I thought I could push my bike home.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.605
I can't. My brother's waiting for me.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.861
Probably thinks I turned
into an eater by now.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.201
Ah. Like this one.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.248
Right.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.501
Get in.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.757
I got him.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.349
I got them.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.613
Might be time for a new stick.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.366
No, I'm good.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.711
Over there.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.766
Now, how do you know the combination?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.764
Interviewed one of the managers
a while back.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.795
Hell of a place to hole up.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.798
Hell of a way to go.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.097
You don't think this might be overkill?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.143
Foot thick, steel-reinforced concrete?

08:00.689 --> 08:05.104
Fireproof, waterproof,
passive air-filtration system.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.111
It's not overkill. It's smart.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.656
Something happens to us, these'll survive.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.367
Anything happens to us,

08:15.453 --> 08:18.696
I'm not sure there'd be anybody left
to watch any of them.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.865
There will be.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.205
If Logan and his dick squad
keep trashing our truck stops,

08:27.298 --> 08:30.132
we're gonna need as many backups
as we can get.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.418
I'll get the decks.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.753
Hey.

08:35.557 --> 08:39.015
Showed up on a run
I don't really need help on.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.842
Rest of the convoy's bursting
at the seams.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.269
How come?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.854
Just didn't think it was smart
for you to be out here on your own.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.195
You're really gonna make
me work for it, huh?

08:53.158 --> 08:54.899
Really nothing to work for, Al.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.700
Gonna get those tape decks now.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.756
How long have you been looking
for those painted trees?

09:13.011 --> 09:16.049
Well, you saw the tape. Since then.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.971
How has that been going?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.800
It's... still going.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.138
Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but...

09:26.107 --> 09:27.848
don't you guys have bigger fish to fry?

09:27.942 --> 09:32.778
There's no shortage of fish frying for us,
I can assure you.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.151
We're still trying to help whoever we can.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.733
This is different.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.620
I want to meet them. I need to.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.743
What do you think is gonna happen
if you do?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.998
- I want to know how they do it.
- Do what?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.454
- The...
- The trees?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.457
- Yeah.
- It's...

09:53.551 --> 09:54.962
It's just paint.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.967
Yeah, but they see the world in a way...
I don't know, I want to see it.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.970
- I think...
- Well,

10:02.060 --> 10:04.894
if you find them,
let me know how that goes.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.764
Little hard to see it ending well.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.689
Nothing ever does.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.027
I'm sorry about what happened.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.154
With Logan.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.742
People are people.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.407
Home, sweet home.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.044
Keep it. You never know.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.920
I do appreciate the lift.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.672
No, thank you.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.429
For what?

11:20.513 --> 11:23.631
We needed a reminder
of why we're out here.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.101
No problem.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.804
I'm gonna run in,
tell my brother what's up.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.560
We'll unload your bike.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.185
We'll leave you some gas.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.067
No, no! No, no, wait!

11:40.158 --> 11:41.158
Wes!

11:41.242 --> 11:42.242
No, no!

11:49.000 --> 11:50.116
Wes, no, no!

11:50.210 --> 11:51.496
Strand, the truck!

12:10.521 --> 12:11.602
Shit.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.485
I take it that wasn't your brother.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.155
Come on.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.411
Mitch.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.135
What the hell?

12:45.974 --> 12:47.636
It's riot gear!

12:50.770 --> 12:51.770
Shit.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.849
Shit.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.020
Tear gas.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.736
We have more company.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.154
Get inside!

13:04.492 --> 13:06.279
- You coming?
- Go!

13:13.543 --> 13:14.543
Strand!

13:14.627 --> 13:17.119
Ah! Get inside!

13:39.360 --> 13:40.646
I'm sorry.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.447
Can you see?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.160
Oh, my God.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.540
Oh.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.883
Oh!

14:12.101 --> 14:14.138
Here, hold this over your eyes.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.728
What the hell was that?

14:24.822 --> 14:27.280
I told you. People are people.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.403
What does that mean?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.234
That man?

14:30.328 --> 14:32.945
He pulled a gun on me a while back.
Took my shit.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.701
- So you came here to kill him?
- No.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.532
You brought us here so you could kill him.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.787
No.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.164
I came here to get what he took from me.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.371
That? That was a bonus.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.672
And your brother?

14:43.758 --> 14:46.626
Don't have one. Haven't for a while.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.759
Alicia, we need to go find that guy.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.714
We can't let him die.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.068
There is still time.
We have a first-aid kit in the truck.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.771
Maybe one of those cruisers
has gas in it that hasn't turned.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.778
Man, you gotta be kiddin' me.
He shot at me first.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.868
Doesn't sound like we're leaving
any time soon.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.700
Good.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.381
- How many people have you killed?
- What?

15:26.968 --> 15:28.960
How many people have you killed?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.882
You have no idea
what it's gonna do to you.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.936
You can't kill one of those eaters,
let alone a herd.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.981
He can't help you, and I won't,
so it looks like I'm gonna find out.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.526
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

15:50.616 --> 15:52.949
<i>I repeat, does anybody copy?</i>

15:53.035 --> 15:55.072
We copy. You okay, Alicia?

15:55.163 --> 15:57.826
Yeah. I know we're not supposed
to broadcast our location,

15:57.915 --> 15:59.451
but I'm not sure what else to do.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.706
Someone out there needs our help,
and we don't have a lot of time.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.586
Can you see anything?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.167
Uh...

16:10.928 --> 16:12.510
not yet.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.717
Well, Morgan and Al
are trying to find him.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.764
They will.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.221
They will.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.562
You're right.
Maybe I shouldn't be out here.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.400
I'm the one who can't see
two feet in front of him.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.366
Exactly.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.422
You've been doing what I can't
for a while now so I don't have to do it.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.426
I don't want to kill the dead,
but I do want to help.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.722
I just don't know how both
those things are possible.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.140
Hmm.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.724
Maybe they're not.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.901
But... I'm willing to keep on trying

17:12.990 --> 17:16.108
until the universe
definitively tells us otherwise.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.716
There's a junction a couple of miles south
from here.

17:39.809 --> 17:43.769
If we take it, we'll end up
on the same road the guy took off on.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.854
Oh, great.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.392
Let's stop.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.624
Morgan.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.126
Hey, Logan.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.169
Mind moving your rig?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.963
Well, hmm...

18:14.135 --> 18:19.426
I'd love to oblige, but, uh...
we seem to have run out of gas.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.303
Hey. Somebody's life is in danger.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.225
Yeah. We heard.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.937
You're really doing this?

18:27.023 --> 18:31.893
You folks don't seem to give a damn
putting your own lives at risk.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.312
But I know you care about everyone else's.

18:36.073 --> 18:39.237
Least that's what you've been advertising
to the world since we first spoke.

18:39.327 --> 18:42.536
So you want to keep that poor fellow
from bleeding out

18:42.622 --> 18:43.622
on the side of the road?

18:43.706 --> 18:46.414
You want to make good
on the promises you've been making

18:46.500 --> 18:49.117
at every gas station from here to El Paso?

18:49.211 --> 18:51.248
Tell me where the damn oil fields are.

18:57.219 --> 19:02.010
Okay. We got all day. And then some.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.933
And I know we both wish
we could say the same

19:05.019 --> 19:08.512
for that poor bastard Alicia let get away.

19:09.273 --> 19:14.064
His time's running out.
And let's face it, yours is, too.

19:15.029 --> 19:19.524
I mean, we can play this one out,
but you guys know where this is going.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.528
And that sucks.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.872
'Cause I... I've really grown
quite fond of you guys.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.585
Tick.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.630
Tick.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.506
Tick.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.805
What about the service road
we passed a couple miles back?

19:50.898 --> 19:52.764
Take us too far north.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.646
We're already burning time.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.278
If we had the MRAP...

19:59.240 --> 20:01.653
Then the tanker wouldn't be protected,

20:01.742 --> 20:03.449
and that roadblock
would be someplace else,

20:03.536 --> 20:05.323
stopping them instead of us.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.993
We don't have time for this.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.428
Okay.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.598
Where is it?

20:27.017 --> 20:30.681
- Why do you need gas?
- Does it matter?

20:30.771 --> 20:33.104
Well, whatever you need
the gasoline for...

20:34.483 --> 20:36.270
we might be able to help you.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.022
You think that "Take what you need,
leave what you don't"

20:42.116 --> 20:44.529
kumbaya horseshit's gonna work on me?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.860
I'm the one that came up with that phrase!

20:46.954 --> 20:49.742
I may have bought into it back then,
but I sure as shit don't now.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.620
But... we do.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.874
And this could work out for you.
You just got to let it.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.461
What I'm doing is bigger than you.

21:05.014 --> 21:08.382
It's bigger than Polar Bear,
and that takes some doing.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.217
It's bigger than your little caravan.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.268
But it is gonna help people.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.729
Just not in a way you're gonna like.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.857
This is big girl, big boy stuff.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.652
And I'm tired of waiting for you to...

21:20.738 --> 21:22.024
grow up or die.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.278
Morgan, we're running out of time.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.367
She's right.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.236
I want to know where the oil fields are.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.533
Hell, I'll even settle
for a quick read of Clayton's journals.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.750
We can't do that.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.881
You're really gonna let that sad sack die
on the side of a road.

21:40.966 --> 21:46.758
See, that's the kind of pragmatism
and realism

21:46.847 --> 21:49.555
and non-stupidism

21:49.642 --> 21:51.679
that makes us more alike than you'd think.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.011
We can't travel if we don't have the gas.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.854
And if you get the oil fields,

21:57.483 --> 21:59.475
that'll put even more people's lives
at risk.

22:00.277 --> 22:04.692
Well... little from column A,
little from column B...

22:08.118 --> 22:11.282
We'll find another way to get to him.
Come on.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.372
Let me give you a piece
of friendly advice, Morgan.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.458
Yeah?

22:15.459 --> 22:19.169
Helping other people
isn't gonna make you feel better

22:19.255 --> 22:21.212
about not being able to help them.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.340
Helping who?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.046
Your wife and son.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.015
What did you just say?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.639
I said that helping other people
isn't gonna...

22:35.729 --> 22:37.391
Ah!

22:37.481 --> 22:38.938
Morgan! Morgan!

22:44.530 --> 22:45.987
Morgan...

22:56.876 --> 22:59.209
If you don't want
people in your business...

23:00.629 --> 23:02.336
then don't put it on a TV.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.504
Let's go.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.569
Must have been something important.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.029
What?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.830
You said he took something from you.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.203
It must have been important.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.417
It was.

23:41.503 --> 23:45.338
And... I think the prick took it
with him when he left.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.310
What?

23:57.353 --> 23:58.969
- I'm waiting.
- For what?

23:59.063 --> 24:00.895
For you to ask me what
it was that he stole.

24:01.857 --> 24:02.857
Why would I...

24:02.942 --> 24:04.558
So you can tell me your story.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.235
Relate it to yourself.

24:06.320 --> 24:10.280
Something you did in your past, maybe.
A lesson to impart.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.366
We're out here because

24:11.408 --> 24:13.491
- we're trying to help people.
- "Trying to help."

24:13.577 --> 24:15.614
Yeah, I know. I saw the movie.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.366
I hate to burst your bubble,

24:17.456 --> 24:20.415
but I'm not like the woman
in the minefield.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.290
I don't need you people
to heal my wounded soul,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.337
or set me on the right path.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.841
That guy was an asshole, plain and simple.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.010
I just... want what he took from me.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.215
What if you don't find it?

24:37.935 --> 24:39.392
What if you don't get it back?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.346
Then you shot that guy for nothing.
He could die for nothing.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.725
He wouldn't be the first.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.432
He'd be your first.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.694
Somebody's gotta be.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.556
Does it have anything
to do with what happened to your brother?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.287
Jesus Christ. Are you serious?

25:00.374 --> 25:01.706
I lost a brother, too.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.624
Wow. We're so alike.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.877
Two peas in a pod.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.377
I'm gonna find another way out of here.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.717
He died.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.307
At the beginning.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.022
Nothing melodramatic, no great story.

25:26.108 --> 25:30.102
Just went out to get some
condensed milk one day...

25:31.405 --> 25:32.987
didn't see an eater coming, and...

25:34.074 --> 25:35.485
that was that.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.359
I'm sorry.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.533
- The motorcycle...
- Was his.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.783
Yeah.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.165
Nicely done.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.750
Look,
I know what you're trying to do here.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.005
You look at me, you see a guy
who's taken a bit of a beating.

25:55.137 --> 25:59.381
You think maybe if I can appeal
to that part of him

25:59.475 --> 26:02.468
from when his brother was still around,
maybe I can change him.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.720
Maybe I can "bring out the light."

26:08.025 --> 26:11.234
That's got nothing to do with why
I'm here, or why I shot that scumbag.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.440
Then, why did you do it?

26:14.364 --> 26:17.323
Because this is the way things are now.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.119
We shoot.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.487
We kill.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.825
If it's not him, it'd be someone else.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.126
<i>Alicia, we're still far out.</i>

26:29.213 --> 26:31.626
<i>Logan put up a roadblock to stall us.</i>

26:32.549 --> 26:33.710
See what I mean?

26:37.971 --> 26:39.712
It doesn't have to be like that.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.259
You haven't killed anyone yet.
He's still out there.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.353
You can help him.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.882
- Alicia...
- It's okay.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.118
I think I can get one
of the squad cars running

27:23.142 --> 27:26.681
with the fuel we were gonna leave him.
I saw the keys in the armoury.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.017
But, uh, I...

27:30.107 --> 27:34.522
I know. I know.
You just stay here.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.731
Are you sure about this?

27:39.825 --> 27:42.693
You haven't killed any of the dead
since before the plane.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.785
Someone out there needs our help.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.580
If this is what it takes,
then this is what it takes.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.459
Wait.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.052
I'll clear them. I'll help you.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.138
Better hope these hold.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.311
'Cause it's gonna get loud.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.618
Let's get those keys.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.003
There's more eaters in back.
Heading that way now.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.257
Come on, come on.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.461
These are all for the building.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.176
Got 'em.

29:37.818 --> 29:38.899
Alicia.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.064
Shit.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.122
Okay. Okay.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.391
How many more?

30:16.481 --> 30:17.972
- What?
- How many?

30:18.066 --> 30:19.227
Two. But you can't...

30:19.318 --> 30:21.118
I can and I will.
I just need you to guide me.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.901
You guys okay?

30:30.996 --> 30:31.996
Yes.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.423
If we cut through that farm road...

30:53.935 --> 30:56.393
we can probably make it
the rest of the way on foot.

31:03.904 --> 31:04.985
I'm sorry.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.360
For what?

31:12.079 --> 31:16.540
I shouldn't have put what you said
about your family on the documentary.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.161
I knew it was there.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.544
I was okay with it.

31:30.430 --> 31:33.093
Didn't seem like it back there.

31:35.143 --> 31:38.432
We made that documentary
to show people who we are.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.186
To get them to trust us.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.977
So we had to say who we are.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.944
It's just who I am.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.369
Bullshit.

31:54.830 --> 31:59.416
That's not "just" who we are.
We're not ghosts.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.209
What we lost doesn't define us.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.295
Maybe what we do.

32:14.683 --> 32:15.890
Maybe.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.388
Or maybe what we're running from.
I don't know.

32:28.572 --> 32:29.688
That's the turn.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.363
<i>Morgan, Al, do you copy?</i>

32:34.119 --> 32:35.985
Hey, Alicia. Did you find him?

32:37.247 --> 32:38.988
Yeah, but not how we hoped.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.330
<i>Sorry to hear that. We're on our way.</i>

32:43.420 --> 32:44.831
Copy that.

32:59.728 --> 33:00.889
Sorry.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.397
Why?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.270
I'm getting it back.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.542
Hey.

33:35.639 --> 33:36.880
Wes!

34:00.121 --> 34:01.328
Where is it?

34:01.998 --> 34:04.206
- What?
- My manuscript.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.622
- You wrote that?
- Where is it?

34:07.712 --> 34:09.168
My bag.

34:09.255 --> 34:13.420
Oh, God... I just wanted to finish it.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.100
It's good stuff.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.568
It's really good stuff.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.295
You killed him because he stole your book?

34:58.179 --> 34:59.795
God, you made me care.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.095
I never should have radioed you.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.645
But you were right.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.357
But I don't need "right" right now.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.360
'Cause at the end of the day...

35:17.949 --> 35:19.440
people are people.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.611
And they're just gonna leave you
wanting more.

35:33.882 --> 35:34.998
Your book.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.798
He died for it.

35:46.686 --> 35:47.847
He can keep it.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.413
How is it?

36:14.881 --> 36:16.668
I think he wrote it for his brother.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.716
- Ah.
- That's why he wanted it back.

36:19.803 --> 36:20.919
Ah.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.061
I think Wes does more
than just write books.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.987
The trees... Wes painted them.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.665
I'm sorry.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.048
I know that's not
who you were hoping to find.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.554
You're right.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.348
I'm not gonna find
what I'm looking for from anybody else.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.187
Beautiful.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.860
You made it your own.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.369
- I got it.
- No.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.005
Alicia?

39:14.269 --> 39:16.261
- You good?
- Yeah.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.355
I'm good.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.612
Ready to head out?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.823
Well, you were wrong, Al.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.783
And, um...

40:17.874 --> 40:19.081
And you were right.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.452
I'm not running away from anything.

40:24.839 --> 40:25.875
But, yeah, I'm...

40:25.965 --> 40:29.834
I am not a ghost,
and I am not just what I've lost.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.921
And I hold on to it because
it is connected, you know? And it's...

40:35.266 --> 40:37.178
connected to everything.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.927
- The good stuff, too.
- Uh-huh.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.647
I've been seeing a little bit
of it lately.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.524
Jenny and...

40:48.029 --> 40:50.021
Duane and how we used to be.

40:54.410 --> 40:58.279
Any time I try and get past it,
I-I try and put it behind me.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.199
I get worried I'm gonna lose some
of the good, too.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.412
So I hold on to it all.

41:08.508 --> 41:11.421
We can make sure you don't lose
anything you don't want to.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.425
How?

41:17.976 --> 41:20.468
You can tell me about your wife and son.

41:30.738 --> 41:31.774
Okay.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.377
We're in.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.335
I'm on it.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.276
How'd you know this was here?

42:58.284 --> 43:02.949
Like I told them...
this is a lot bigger than you think.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.248
The journals aren't here.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.833
Start watching these.

43:10.296 --> 43:13.664
Someone must have slipped up
while they were shooting that damn thing.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.051
Adios, yesterday.

43:19.472 --> 43:20.929
Hello, tomorrow.
