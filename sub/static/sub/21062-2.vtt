00:02.130 --> 00:04.166
- Charley: Previously
on "Queen Sugar"...
- ( siren wails)

00:04.200 --> 00:05.565
Get out of the car now!

00:05.600 --> 00:07.636
They won't give me
the loan for the mill.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.730
- What are you talking about?
- Charley: Unless Davis
signs off on it.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.476
I think it's best
for both of us

00:12.510 --> 00:14.398
if we just keep things
professional.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.773
- Things didn't end right.
I wanna see you.
- Me, too, baby.

00:17.810 --> 00:20.278
Charley:
You have my son in custody.
This is your fault!

00:20.320 --> 00:22.049
- Davis: These things happen.
- These things?

00:22.090 --> 00:23.409
You know what _
your damn problem Is?

00:23.450 --> 00:26.317
For once you don't have
the answers.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.249
It just feels like all of this
has been moving really fast.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.689
You're breaking up with me?

00:34.100 --> 00:35.453
- Do you want a receipt?
- No.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.626
Thank you.

00:38.170 --> 00:41.162
( music playing
on car stereo )

00:42.710 --> 00:44.701
What's going on, Darla?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.268
What are you doing here?

00:48.310 --> 00:50.574
Oh, you know,
I just wanted to
see you, that's all.

00:50.610 --> 00:52.419

00:52.450 --> 00:54.771
Hey!

00:54.820 --> 00:56.287
Hi.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.618
Pop's taking me out
on an errand, Mama.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.551
What?
That sounds
like a special day.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.285
Wanna come with us?

01:03.330 --> 01:05.548
Can't. Wish I could.
Working.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.319
I got you something.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.419
Beignets

01:09.470 --> 01:12.166
- That's the thing
you like, right?
- Yes.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.135
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.138
( clears throat )

01:17.170 --> 01:19.707
So, I wanted to know
about us, uh...

01:19.740 --> 01:22.402
taking it slow and all.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.441
But I was hoping I could
take you out tonight.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.447
( laughs )

01:25.480 --> 01:26.777
- On a date.
' ( gasps )

01:26.820 --> 01:28.708
A real date.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.242
A proper date.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.111
( horn honks )

01:34.160 --> 01:35.582
You better
get gomg.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.826
No.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.499
Not till I get my answer.

01:41.230 --> 01:44.165
Is that a yes?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.394
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.739
- You heard that, Blue?
- Yep.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.761
- Bye, my loves.
- Bye.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.737
( theme music playing )

01:54.780 --> 01:58.739
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

01:58.780 --> 02:02.489
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the world
turns *

02:02.520 --> 02:05.318
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

02:07.190 --> 02:08.680
* Dreams never die

02:14.460 --> 02:18.396
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

02:18.430 --> 02:22.264
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight. *

02:35.450 --> 02:37.918
- Morning, y'all!
- Men: Morning.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.282
How is everybody?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.527
Looking like a queen
as always, Nova.

02:44.260 --> 02:46.194
Got some heads up in here
this morning, D.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.891
No doubt.
Business been good.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.227
( chuckles )

02:49.270 --> 02:50.897
Thank you.

02:50.930 --> 02:53.433
- ( scoffs )
- ( change rattles )

02:53.470 --> 02:57.236
This can's
a little light, y'all.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.567
Psst, psst.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.546
Take this to the lady.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.419
Thank you, honey.
You're a sweetie.

03:08.780 --> 03:11.283
If you come back through
a little later,

03:11.320 --> 03:14.312
I promise you
it'll be straight.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.227
Tips today-- I want 'em
in this here can, fellas.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.750
Y'all feel me?

03:18.790 --> 03:21.725
Every one of y'all
know somebody sitting
up in the OPP now

03:21.760 --> 03:23.625
or did _some time there
In the past

03:23.670 --> 03:26.662
'cause they couldn't raise
300, $400 to post bail.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.839
A community bail fund
could change that.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.305
I'm not here
to call anybody out.

03:33.340 --> 03:36.446
I appreciate y'all
giving what you can,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.471
but do this for me.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.445
Come out to the community
fundraiser tonight

03:41.480 --> 03:44.278
and show your love
with your presence, too?

03:44.320 --> 03:46.311
- Yeah?
- Man: Yes, ma'am.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.351
And you, too?

03:48.390 --> 03:50.278
I'll see y'all later.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.820
- ( door opens )
- Man: All right, girl.

03:51.860 --> 03:52.895
Man #2:
Take care, now.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.792
( news radio playing
in background )

03:56.830 --> 03:58.866
- Hey.
- Violet: Hey!

03:58.900 --> 04:02.609
Dang! You got it
going on in here,
Aunt Vi!

04:02.640 --> 04:05.609
Yeah, and the last batch
will be out in a few minutes.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.608
( grunts )

04:07.640 --> 04:09.801
( sniffs )
I don't know how I'm gonna
repay you for all the time

04:09.850 --> 04:12.842
- and energy you're
putting into this.
- Repay me?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.768
I'm grateful, Aunt Vi.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.449
And I know
our volunteers will be, too,
once they get a taste.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.552
- Charley here?
- Yeah.

04:21.590 --> 04:24.479
She fixing to take Micah
to summer school.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.498
He went back already?

04:26.530 --> 04:28.998
Back?
He's been for three days.

04:29.030 --> 04:30.429
How's he doing?

04:30.470 --> 04:33.769
Well, he ain't eating
much of anything

04:33.800 --> 04:37.463
and acting like
nothing's happened,
so I don't know.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.004
Nephew!

04:47.080 --> 04:50.049
( knocking )

04:55.420 --> 04:57.752
Hey, nephew.

04:57.790 --> 04:58.722
Hey.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.528
How's school?

05:11.570 --> 05:12.901
It's all right.

05:19.550 --> 05:22.940
Anything you wanna...

05:22.990 --> 05:24.639
talk about?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.008
No. Ijust...

05:29.760 --> 05:30.988
I'm fine.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.925
I don't know what
those police said to you...

05:39.940 --> 05:41.532
or what they did...

05:43.710 --> 05:45.837
but we can talk
about it.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.740
We can talk
about anything.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.881
I'm fine...
Aunt Nova, really.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.630
Mill loan come through?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.137
Yeah, should close
the next day or so.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.647
At least it better.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.648
You've got this,
Charley.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.942
Harvest is right around
the corner,

06:26.980 --> 06:28.868
and I've gotta get
these renovations going.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.912
So it's back to NoLa
for another dog and pony show?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.751
I'm meeting with Davis
this morning.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.929
Divorce_mediation.
It's our final sessnon.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.827
- Why didn't you say something?
- Violet: Say something
about what?

06:44.970 --> 06:47.438
What?

06:47.470 --> 06:49.836
My final divorce mediation
with Davis

06:49.870 --> 06:51.565
is scheduled
for this morning.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.736
- Oh, Charley, baby--
- I'm coming with you.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.429
No, no one
is coming with me.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.038
This is why
I didn't say anything.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.901
- I know how y'all are.
- That's right! We're family.

06:58.950 --> 07:02.943
Look, I am perfectly capable
of dealing with this by myself.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.480
And what about Micah?

07:04.520 --> 07:05.782
How's he dealing
with this?

07:05.820 --> 07:09.119
I know it's hard,
but he's resilient.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.718
It's a process.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.649
Well, that boy has a lot
to process right about now

07:13.700 --> 07:15.850
between this
and being stopped
by the police.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.869
I'm here for him.
He knows that.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.539
Hi. You ready?

07:21.570 --> 07:23.800
Violet: Hey, baby.
Let me fix you some breakfast.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.707
- No, thank you.
- Micah, you need
to eat something.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.071
We'll stop on the way.

07:34.550 --> 07:35.744
Bye.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.979
Man:
Well, smce you're
going in late,

07:44.030 --> 07:47.898
I'm thinking hybrid soybean
be your best bet, MG V.

07:47.930 --> 07:50.160
Now, it's gonna cost you
a little more up front,

07:50.200 --> 07:51.792
but it grows
to canopy faster

07:51.830 --> 07:54.697
so you'll save
on weed control later.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.958
( chicks chirping )

07:57.010 --> 07:58.568
How much more?

07:58.610 --> 08:00.737
( music playing
on stereo )

08:05.910 --> 08:07.639
Blue. Hey!

08:07.680 --> 08:09.648
You can't just go
in people's stuff
like that.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.112
I'm feeding
the chicks.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.584
I think
they're hungry.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.588
You know the drill,
don't you, Blue?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.588
Ernest used
to bring him here.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.983
Come on, Pop,
I'll show you.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.691
Just go ahead
while I work you up
a price.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.197
- All right.
- ( chuckles )

08:26.200 --> 08:27.758
( chirping )

08:27.800 --> 08:30.007
- You can pet it.
- I could pet it?

08:30.040 --> 08:31.769
It's really soft.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.668
What's up, buddy?

08:35.710 --> 08:37.143
( chuckles )

08:40.180 --> 08:42.614
You know, your working

08:42.650 --> 08:44.880

08:44.920 --> 08:48.287

like a real farmer.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.027
I appreciate that,
Mr. Cyrus.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.698
Ernest is smiling.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.721
( chuckles )

08:57.230 --> 08:59.266
( scoffs )

08:59.300 --> 09:00.699
3,200?

09:00.740 --> 09:02.298
Come on, Blue.

09:02.340 --> 09:06.709
- ( piano music playing )
_ ( keyboard clicking,
printer whirs )

09:06.740 --> 09:10.141
- The seeds are
for Blue's Corner?
- That's right, Blue's Corner.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.317
I'm sorry,
but your account is--

09:14.350 --> 09:16.614
- What? Not enough money?
- Oh, no, it's not that.

09:16.650 --> 09:18.845
The signatory requirements
have changed.

09:18.890 --> 09:22.053
It now requires another
signature for withdrawals--

09:22.090 --> 09:24.024
Charley Bordelon-West.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.894
Can you let this slide now,
and I'll talk to her?

09:31.630 --> 09:33.939
I can't.
Bank policy.

09:33.970 --> 09:37.133
Bank policy.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.660
Come on,
let's go, buddy.

09:38.710 --> 09:41.838
Oh, uh,
can he have this?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.905
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.839
- You want one, Pop?
- I'm good, Blue.
Come on.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.016
( music playing )

09:52.050 --> 09:53.915
- Roberta.
- Yes, ma'am?

09:53.960 --> 09:55.882
Excuse me, miss.
Come on.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.820
What's going on,
fellas?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.691
We're a little backed up,
but I'm gonna take care of you.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.357
Okay?
All right.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.164
- Aunt Vi!
- Wai-- hey.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.839
I'm glad to see you.
What you been doing?

10:06.870 --> 10:08.792
- Helping Pop.
- Well, that's good.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.229
- He needs help, huh?
- Back taking orders?

10:11.270 --> 10:14.034
- I thought you was managing.
- Don't mess with me.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.106
I am down two waitresses,
I got a leak in the kitchen,

10:17.150 --> 10:18.276
and the freezer broke.

10:18.310 --> 10:20.119
Can't serve any bacon
or sausage

10:20.150 --> 10:21.811
on account
of the health department.

10:21.850 --> 10:24.011
These folks was ready to fight
up in here this morning.

10:24.050 --> 10:26.985
- Damn, that's rough.
- So, if y'all want
something to eat,

10:27.020 --> 10:28.351
you're gonna have
to be patient.

10:28.390 --> 10:32.258
Matter of fact,
I was hoping for
a favor, Aunt Vi.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.723
Well, what's that?

10:33.760 --> 10:37.025
I was wondering
if you could watch
Blue for me.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.732
- Where's Darla?
- She working.

10:39.770 --> 10:43.069
I got some business I need
to handle on the farm.

10:43.110 --> 10:48.070
Well, you know
Blue_ is welcome
here With me anytime.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.442
- Thanks, Aunt Vi.
- Mm-hmm.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.914
Can we have spaghetti
for dinner?

10:52.950 --> 10:54.815
Dinner, baby?
What are you talking about?

10:54.850 --> 10:56.818
Pop is taking Mama
on a date.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.887
- Ralph Angel: Ain't nobody
ask you all that--
- ( smooching )

10:59.920 --> 11:02.309
All right, baby.
Listen, I'm working.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.749
Go behind the counter
and get the sugar packets

11:04.790 --> 11:06.280
and restock the tables.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.059
- Okay.
- Go.

11:10.730 --> 11:13.130
I wanna do something
special for Darla.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.029
So?

11:17.070 --> 11:19.334
Well, yeah,
you know I'm not gonna
turn down a chance

11:19.370 --> 11:21.429
to spend time
with that boy.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.072
Thank you.

11:23.110 --> 11:25.078
You sure you know
what you're doing?

11:25.110 --> 11:28.079
Ahem, look, you talk
to Charley today?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.418
Not since this morning.
Why?

11:30.450 --> 11:32.008
I need to talk to her,
that's all.

11:32.050 --> 11:35.713
Well, today is
Charley's divorce mediation.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.785
I didn't know.

11:37.830 --> 11:41.152
I don't know what's going on
between the two of you
at the moment,

11:41.200 --> 11:45.159
but I need you to give her
some grace today.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.002
- Remy: Farm account?
- Roberta: Y'all good?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.802
Yeah, baby, thanks.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.772
Why would she have said
anything to me about it?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.947
Y'all been working
on the mill loan together.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.844
You was organizing
the farmers for it.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.448
- I figured you probably--
- You figured wrong.

12:08.090 --> 12:10.058
I didn't mean
no disrespect.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.794
Oh...

12:13.830 --> 12:15.252
your sister and me...

12:17.000 --> 12:19.161
Look, it's just
about that mill.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.192
It's about the mill
and getting through
the harvest, and that's all.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.208
And if there's something
on that farm that needs fixing,

12:24.240 --> 12:26.367
I'm sure Charley
will spend money on it.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.199
I'm planting
a soybean crop.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.118
Got it.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.015
And you need
to buy seed?

12:42.830 --> 12:46.084
I'm tired of going to Charley
every time I need something.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.551
This is about
the future, right, man?

12:49.600 --> 12:52.125
Pops wanted me
to keep farming.

12:52.170 --> 12:55.162
He held on long as he did
so we could build a business,

12:55.200 --> 12:57.202
and that's what I wanna do.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.172
Look here.

13:04.210 --> 13:07.179
I can see you wanna make
your own moves, all right?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.573
Why don't you try
to get a microloan

13:08.620 --> 13:10.087
from the Farm Services
Agency?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.338
Ain't nobody gonna
give me money, Remy.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.858
Not on parole.
Shit, no credit, too?

13:14.890 --> 13:17.552
- Come on.
- Don't be so quick to say
what somebody gonna do.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.228
_ Look at--
listen to me, man.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.423
I believe in you,
and I believe in that farm.

13:22.460 --> 13:25.497
And whatever's happening
or not happening between me
and your sister,

13:25.530 --> 13:27.896
that's not gonna change
the love I got for your daddy,

13:27.940 --> 13:31.307
for your family,
and that land,
you hear me?

13:31.340 --> 13:35.174
That microloan program
is for young farmers
like yourself

13:35.210 --> 13:38.577
with no capital, little credit,
but who are actually farming

13:38.610 --> 13:41.443
and have small needs
here and there.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.085
So long as you got a job,
a farm to work,

13:44.120 --> 13:45.587
and you never been
convicted of growing

13:45.620 --> 13:49.386
or distributing drugs--
which you haven't been, right?

13:49.420 --> 13:51.888
( laughs )
Right?

13:51.930 --> 13:53.352
That means
you're eligible.

13:54.630 --> 13:58.293
S-so maybe
I could, like...

13:58.330 --> 14:00.059
do it by myself?

14:00.100 --> 14:03.501
Yeah, maybe you could
do it by yourself.

14:12.980 --> 14:14.470
Ralph Angel:
I'll see y'all.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.442
- Hey.
- What's going on?

14:16.480 --> 14:19.916
- Aunt Vi here?
- Yeah, she with Blue.
They in the back office.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.920
I got stuff to do, Nova.
Farm don't just run itself.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.655
I know it don't!

14:25.690 --> 14:28.295
I know
you working hard, bro.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.195
Like I said,
they in the back there.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.095
Listen, I got a bunch of food
and stuff that I'm hauling

14:32.130 --> 14:33.631
to this fundraiser tonight.

14:33.670 --> 14:36.662
- I was wondering-- maybe--
- I can't. I got errands.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.999
- Maybe I could use your truck.
- Plus my truck's already
loaded up.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.928
You oughta come
and check it out.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.073
Raising money
for a bail fund.

14:45.410 --> 14:48.049
Could always use more brothers
supporting the cause.

14:50.150 --> 14:54.189
Nova, I ain't got time
for this right now. Bye.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.955
Excuse me, brother,
how you doing?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.399
You wanna _come_out
to the community bail fund?

15:02.430 --> 15:03.692
Yeah, all right.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.493
You, too.
Wanna come?
Check it out.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.363
We'll just take
a few deep breaths
before we go in.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.038
We should have you out
in plenty of time

15:10.070 --> 15:11.503
for you to do
what you need to do.

15:11.540 --> 15:15.408
And remember, they have
agreed in principle
to everything.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.408
You're in great shape.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.509
( sighs )
I just want this
to be over.

15:19.550 --> 15:23.088
Eyes on the prize, Charley.
You're almost there.

15:30.690 --> 15:33.454
Woman:
Charley, Davis,

15:33.500 --> 15:37.061
this is the last
of our scheduled
mediation seSSIons.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.465
I know it hasn't always
been easy,

15:38.500 --> 15:40.536
but I want to commend you both
on your willingness

15:40.570 --> 15:44.062
to seek out common ground
during this process.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.032
It's an emotional time
In your lives--

15:46.070 --> 15:47.469
Davis:
Excuse me.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.705
I'd like a moment alone
with Charley.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.018
Davis, so far this
has been an open process

15:57.050 --> 15:58.449
with open communication.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.708
I know that.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.456
I'm asking for a moment.

16:03.490 --> 16:04.752
Just the two of us.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.189
Davis, what are you doing?

16:06.230 --> 16:08.494
Charley, please.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.532
( door opens )

16:22.780 --> 16:24.407
( door closes )

16:33.160 --> 16:34.752
We're paying them all
by the hour.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.485
You know that, right?

16:36.520 --> 16:38.454
( chuckles )

16:38.490 --> 16:40.094
I don't care
about the money,
Charley.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.759
- You've never had to.
- Well, neither of us has.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.461
And not for a long time.

16:50.540 --> 16:55.330
Look, Charley, we built
something incredible,
you know that?

16:55.380 --> 16:57.143
And we did it together.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.655
Our assets are all
accounted for in there.

17:07.690 --> 17:10.579
So, this is
what our 18 years
comes down to.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.155
Hmm?
Just ink and paper.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.452
Okay, so what is it
you want, Davis?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.695
We've already agreed on how
we're dividing everything up,

17:17.730 --> 17:20.267
but clearly you've had
second thoughts.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.063
So, what is it?

17:22.100 --> 17:25.809
Is it the house in LA,
Aspen property, what?

17:25.840 --> 17:28.274
The property?

17:28.310 --> 17:31.199
That's what you think
this is all about?

17:31.250 --> 17:33.411
Well, here.
Here you go, Charley.

17:33.450 --> 17:36.772
Take your first pick.
Doesn't really matter to me.

17:36.820 --> 17:40.278
Fine. Let's call everyone
in here and wrap this up.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.788
- I want to talk about Micah.
- What about Micah?

17:42.820 --> 17:45.323
I want to revisit
the arrangement.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.295
I want joint custody.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.838
No.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.792
Charley, the reason
I signed with the Stingers

17:55.840 --> 17:57.535
is so that I can spend
more time with Micah.

17:57.570 --> 18:01.233
You don't need joint custody
to spend time with your son.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.145
You simply need
to make it a priority.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.304
I want my attorney
back in here.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.274
And I don't want
to just see him, Charley.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.141
I want to raise him.
He deserves that.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.112
Charley,
after what happened
with the police,

18:14.160 --> 18:15.718
it's important
that I'm in his life,
his father.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.728
You ain't shit, Davis,
you know that?

18:17.760 --> 18:19.421
You're the last thing
Micah needs.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.724
Okay. Well, look,
I've already spoken
with him about it.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.297
You what?! _
You are a damn liar!

18:24.330 --> 18:27.197
No, no, no.
Charley, we talked
about it, all right?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.435
He's in favor of me
having joint custody.

18:39.250 --> 18:44.483
* The thin line
between love and hate *

18:45.620 --> 18:48.885
* Battle with myself

18:48.920 --> 18:52.549
* And war on my own...

18:52.590 --> 18:57.618
- ( line ringing )
- * How much of this
can I take? *

18:57.670 --> 19:00.434
- ( cell phone buzzing )
- Hello?

19:00.470 --> 19:02.495
Micah?

19:02.540 --> 19:03.768
Where are you, baby?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.563
- I'm... with friends.
- Who?

19:06.610 --> 19:07.736
Kiki?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.839
Uh, no, I'm just--

19:09.880 --> 19:11.370
I'm just checking out
the city, Mom.

19:11.410 --> 19:14.413
Micah, I'm here
at your school.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.312
Baby, you just left?

19:19.350 --> 19:20.556
Mom, I'm okay.

19:20.590 --> 19:23.684
I know you keep saying that,
sweetheart, but--

19:23.730 --> 19:25.925
but it's okay
if you're not.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.293
- Just tell me where you are
and I'll come to you.
- Mom, I'm okay.

19:29.330 --> 19:32.891
I just-- I just couldn't
be there today.

19:32.930 --> 19:35.637
I just need you
to give me some space.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.239
Okay.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.487
But you have to call me.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.817
Later.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.385
- Promise me, okay?
- I will, I will.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.625
Bye.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.493
*

20:10.370 --> 20:12.634
(crying )

20:37.370 --> 20:39.861
Like you said, they was
up in the shop this morning.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.959
( both laugh )

20:43.770 --> 20:45.533
You want me
to walk you to your car?

20:45.570 --> 20:46.730
Come on, now, D.

20:46.770 --> 20:49.534
Folks know me
around here.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.707
Listen, you've done enough,
brother, really.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.048
Nova, Nova...

20:54.080 --> 20:55.342
anything for you.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.848
D'Andre,
about the other night,

20:57.890 --> 20:59.448
what happened
between us--

20:59.490 --> 21:03.358
Yeah, I can't stop
thinking about it,
about you.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.449
Listen...

21:05.490 --> 21:06.855
it was cool.

21:06.890 --> 21:10.963
But, uh, let's--
let's just leave it
at that.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.539
You can't_blame a brother
for trying, can you?

21:16.840 --> 21:19.308
All I'm saying
is that you can call me.

21:19.340 --> 21:21.501
Don't matter
what time of day.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.507
You hear me?

21:24.710 --> 21:27.042
I hear you.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.945
- Can I have the can?
- Mm-hmm.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.380
Can I go?
Can...

21:31.420 --> 21:32.717
Bye.

21:33.990 --> 21:36.550
( music playing )

21:36.590 --> 21:39.286
Bertie, you look like
you done seen a ghost.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.726
- What is it?
- I'm not even sure
I heard it right.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.635
Heard what?

21:48.670 --> 21:52.060
You know
the name of that rig
Hollywood's on?

21:52.110 --> 21:55.568
The Octo Oleum?
Out in Vermilion Bay?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.806
I need you
to start talking.
What?

21:59.850 --> 22:01.943
Mona and Jack
just left out of here.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.948
Did something happen
to their son Leon?

22:03.990 --> 22:07.585
They were talking about
an electrical problem
on that rig.

22:07.620 --> 22:10.521
Electrical?

22:10.560 --> 22:12.687
Was there a fire?

22:12.730 --> 22:15.654
You need _
to spit It out, girl.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.759
What did they say,
Roberta?

22:17.800 --> 22:20.769
They were saying that rig
just had an explosion.

22:28.140 --> 22:31.473
( touch tones beeping )

22:37.180 --> 22:40.388
Hollywood, pick up.

22:41.690 --> 22:42.918
This is Hollywood.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.120
Can't get to the phone
right now,

22:44.160 --> 22:45.354
but you know what to do.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.721
( bus hissing )

22:56.940 --> 22:58.464
Transfer?

22:58.510 --> 23:00.159
Uh, um,
I'm not sure.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.873
- Can I just--
- You need a Jazzy Pass.

23:03.910 --> 23:08.119
- I don't know
what that is.
- Or cash. $1.25.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.584
Sir, you need
to step aside.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.097
Let this other lady
get on the bus, please.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.018
Sorry, sorry.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.028
Excuse me.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.538
( bell tolling )

23:30.070 --> 23:32.538
( bus door closes )

23:37.080 --> 23:39.048
( sighs )

23:39.080 --> 23:41.776
- ( music playing )
- ( man vocalizing )

23:44.520 --> 23:47.683
( police radio chatter)

23:52.090 --> 23:56.129
* Magnetic light
in the blue-high haze *

23:59.570 --> 24:03.438
* A magnifying glass
upon my face *

24:05.670 --> 24:09.709
* It's so hot,
I've been melting out here *

24:09.740 --> 24:13.176
* I'm made out of plastic
out here *

24:13.210 --> 24:17.112
_ * You touched down
In the base of my fears *

24:17.150 --> 24:19.744
* Houston,
can-can-can you hear? *

24:19.790 --> 24:24.557
- ( men chattering )
- * And we both had
to harness our pain *

24:24.590 --> 24:27.696
* Close it
and hope it decays *

24:27.730 --> 24:30.893
* Oh, inhale
and I'm up and away *

24:32.800 --> 24:35.689
* I'm up and away

24:35.740 --> 24:39.733
* You dare know
what the scarecrow hears... *

24:46.280 --> 24:48.976
- ( music playing )
- How's your food?

24:49.020 --> 24:50.715
- It's really good.
- ( chuckles )

24:52.020 --> 24:54.511
- How's yours?
- Good.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.694
I kind of forgot
how to do this.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.561
I know.

25:06.670 --> 25:09.230
I didn't think
I'd be so nervous.

25:09.270 --> 25:11.067
It's been a minute.

25:11.110 --> 25:16.002
I think my last
official date was...

25:16.040 --> 25:17.905
definitely before Blue.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.646
Don't act like you forgot.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.216
They let us stay up
in the Apple Barrel

25:22.250 --> 25:24.081
- till 5:00 AM.
- ( Blue squealing )

25:24.120 --> 25:26.714
I remember _
how you was dancmg.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.957
Can you play a little softer
with Kenya, please?

25:28.990 --> 25:30.855
And you have to eat,
too, Blue.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.569
( whispers )
We have to play
quiet now.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.637
So, um,
how was your day?

25:40.670 --> 25:42.092
It was big.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.938
Yeah.
I'm getting a loan.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.939
- What?
- At least I hope
it comes through, mm-hmm.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.699
- ( Blue humming )
- That's amazing.
How is that even--

25:50.750 --> 25:53.674
Making moves.
Make more money on the farm.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.847
Without Charley having
her hands all in it.

25:55.880 --> 25:59.589
- ( Blue playing )
- Went down to the FSA today,
filled out the paperwork.

25:59.620 --> 26:03.010
- What about your parole?
- They said it doesn't matter.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.221
They wanna help
farmers like me.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.120
I'm happy for you.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.664
- ( mutters )
- ( Blue humming tune)

26:11.700 --> 26:14.692
- Blue, sit down.
- He just playing.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.935
- They're trying to have dinner.
- Darla, they don't mind.

26:16.970 --> 26:20.007
That's not how I want him
to act when we're out.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.238
Hey.

26:25.110 --> 26:27.613
It's just new for you,
right, buddy?

26:27.650 --> 26:31.586
It's okay.
It's new for us, too.

26:33.390 --> 26:35.813
- I like that.
- Thank you.

27:31.910 --> 27:34.049
( line ringing )

27:40.990 --> 27:42.685
Female voice:
Your call IS being forwarded

27:42.720 --> 27:44.881
_ to an automated
v0Ice messaging system.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.921
At the tone,
please record your message.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.894
When you're
finished recording,
you may hang up

27:48.930 --> 27:51.262
or press 5
for more options.

27:51.300 --> 27:54.133
- ( beeps )
- Hi, Mom.

27:54.170 --> 27:55.694
It's me.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.799
I thought...

28:00.740 --> 28:02.332
I was hoping
you'd pick up.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.345
I was thinking about
when I was a little girl.

28:09.150 --> 28:13.883
You always knew what to say
when the days didn't go my way.

28:17.420 --> 28:18.956
Okay, then.

28:20.930 --> 28:22.329
Look, I miss you.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.362
Uh...

28:24.400 --> 28:26.391
just call
when you have a chance.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.980
-(mu§cpbwng)
-(laughs)

28:47.020 --> 28:49.079
- Would you like
anything else?
- Oh, we good.

28:49.120 --> 28:53.227
- Dessert menu?
- Me and Kenya want dessert!

28:53.260 --> 28:54.989
- That's your doll?
- Uh-huh!

28:55.030 --> 28:56.497
You know, you should
get Transformers.

28:56.530 --> 28:57.997
Those are really cool.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.967
Ralph Angel: Ahem.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.107
Uh, we're gonna get
two ice cream sundaes,

29:07.140 --> 29:09.472
all the toppings
y'all got,

29:09.510 --> 29:12.946
one for my son
and one for his doll.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.415
You got me?

29:17.450 --> 29:20.112
- Not a problem.
- All right.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.891
Hi.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.805
Everything okay?

29:43.140 --> 29:45.847
Tough day?

29:45.880 --> 29:48.019
Yeah, things didn't go
exactly as I planned.

29:48.050 --> 29:50.848
Thought I'd be
divorced by now.

29:55.560 --> 29:59.326
I don't normally receive
visitors today

29:59.360 --> 30:02.557
_on account_ of it
beIng the anniversary
of Shauna's death.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.569
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry, Remy.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.898
- It's okay.
- I-I should go.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.158
- No.
- I don't even know
why I'm here.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.269
You're here now.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.304
You may as well
keep me company.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.898
Please.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.549
This is
a beautiful place.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.082
Yeah.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.989
It belonged
to Shauna's grandmother.

30:36.030 --> 30:37.224
( chuckles )

30:39.230 --> 30:41.039
We worked on it
together.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.938
- Is that hers?
- Yeah.

30:50.010 --> 30:53.878
Shauna was in
the, uh, Army Reserves.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.309
She genuinely loved
serving her country.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.485
She was assigned
to a transportation unit

31:03.520 --> 31:07.251
and stationed in Afghanistan
near Kandahar, and...

31:11.270 --> 31:13.932
We talked most nights
and...

31:17.140 --> 31:20.200
it was late here.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.902
( music playing )

31:22.940 --> 31:26.603
Remy:
She said it was sunny
that morning there.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.139
She sounded really...

31:34.290 --> 31:35.882
at peace.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.267
Remy:
The truck she was in...

31:50.370 --> 31:52.031
ran over an--

31:58.310 --> 32:00.073
ran over an IED.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.143
And that was
four years ago today.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.011
- I'm so sorry, Remy.
- It's okay.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.084
It's okay.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.021
Your daddy, he, um...

32:15.730 --> 32:17.595
I wouldn't have got through it
if it wasn't for him.

32:17.630 --> 32:21.396
* ...covered in shame

32:21.440 --> 32:24.000
* Your subtle weight...

32:25.110 --> 32:26.429
(crying )

32:28.410 --> 32:32.403
* Oh, as trouble lands...

32:32.450 --> 32:33.974
Oh, God, I miss her.

32:34.020 --> 32:37.945
’3‘ ...face first
In our bed *

32:42.390 --> 32:47.225
* I hide it all away
at the sound of your face *

32:49.060 --> 32:55.192
* I am safe,
here and now. *

32:58.410 --> 33:01.106
Didn't think
I'd be here today.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.607
Butthen
I never thought
I'd end up

33:02.640 --> 33:04.540
in Orleans _Parish Prison
neIther.

33:04.580 --> 33:07.105
( chatter)

33:07.150 --> 33:09.243
_ Iwent in for
a misdemeanor charge.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.009
Didn't have the $800
to post bail,

33:11.050 --> 33:13.211
so that's where I stayed.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.753
Long enough
to lose my job.

33:15.790 --> 33:19.351
My lady and my baby boy
got put out of our apartment.

33:19.390 --> 33:21.221
Like I said...

33:21.260 --> 33:24.127
didn't think
I'd be here today.

33:24.170 --> 33:27.094
But when I saw
Nova Bordelon this morning
over at the barbershop...

33:27.130 --> 33:30.463
- ( siren approaching )
- something put it in my heart
to come and tell my story,

33:30.500 --> 33:32.309
to let folks know
this bail fund is important...

33:32.340 --> 33:34.103
- ( crowd agrees )
- ...and that we have a voice.

33:34.140 --> 33:36.108
- ( light applause )
- And we should speak up.

33:36.140 --> 33:39.507
And I guess just--
that's why I'm here today.

33:39.550 --> 33:42.747
( crowd cheering
and applauding )

33:42.780 --> 33:44.680
Nova:
Thank you, Trevor.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.585
- That's why we're here.
- Man: Hell, yeah!

33:46.620 --> 33:51.080
We're here for those
whose voices cannot
be heard tonight,

33:51.130 --> 33:54.588
men and women locked up
for no other reason

33:54.630 --> 33:57.349
than because
they're poor and black.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.665
These brothers and sisters
find themselves

34:00.700 --> 34:04.306
caught up in a system
meant to destroy them,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.661
falling into an abyss
that has swallowed up

34:06.710 --> 34:09.804
too many of our people
for too long.

34:12.180 --> 34:17.743
These police officers,
they're trying to intimidate us.

34:17.780 --> 34:20.180
They want us
to fear them.

34:20.220 --> 34:22.814
- But we're not afraid.
- Man: They don't scare us!

34:22.860 --> 34:27.229
They want us to fade away,
but we won't.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.558
They want to erase
our humanity,

34:29.600 --> 34:33.559
to act as if
we don't exist,

34:33.600 --> 34:38.333
but these black bodies
are real!

34:38.370 --> 34:40.065
Precious!

34:40.910 --> 34:43.231
We cannot allow
black bodies

34:43.280 --> 34:45.874
to simply be
disposed of like trash!

34:45.910 --> 34:48.674
( scattered cheering,
clapping )

34:48.720 --> 34:51.314
( music playing )

34:51.350 --> 34:52.681
(thuds)

34:52.720 --> 34:53.846
Mmm...

35:04.630 --> 35:06.791
You leave enough?

35:06.830 --> 35:08.798
I got it.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.348
The tip, though.

35:19.380 --> 35:22.611
He don't deserve no tip
after what he said to Blue.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.709
He luclq he getting paid.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.787
We have to leave him
a lIttle something,

35:27.820 --> 35:29.515
show him we're not
on hIs level.

35:33.530 --> 35:35.828
Don't you want to set
an example for Blue?

35:39.800 --> 35:43.691
Look, I only brought
a certain amount of money
for tonight.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.765
I wasn't planning
on that extra dessert,

35:45.810 --> 35:48.404
but the waiter got me.

35:51.510 --> 35:53.398
What you doing? No.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.577
- I want to. I want to.
- You can't do that. No.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.679
You're not supposed to.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.779
This is me
taking you out.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.253
I'm trying
to do this right.

36:01.290 --> 36:02.848
You are
doing this right.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.422
Ralph Angel...

36:09.430 --> 36:11.921
you don't have to play
a role for me.

36:11.970 --> 36:16.339
We are so beyond that,
right?

36:20.710 --> 36:23.338
Let's just be us.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.677
Who we are.

36:24.710 --> 36:27.304
Honest with each other.

36:29.780 --> 36:30.872
Okay?

36:32.720 --> 36:34.312
All right.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.750
Me and Kenya
wanna go now.

36:37.790 --> 36:40.327
All right, we--
we getting outta here.

36:42.430 --> 36:44.364
This is
Ralph Angel Bordelon.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.425
I got your message
about my application.

36:46.470 --> 36:49.769
Sounds like it's looking
real good.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.837
Did my best with projections
and budgets.

36:52.870 --> 36:54.701
Mr. Newell helped me out
with it.

36:56.940 --> 37:00.740
Um, I'm leaving this message,
let y'all know

37:00.780 --> 37:04.284
that I'ma get that letter
from my employer

37:04.320 --> 37:07.585
and the title
as soon as I can.

37:07.620 --> 37:09.656
All right,
I appreciate it.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.894
( sighs )

37:28.540 --> 37:29.973
Charley:
You made this?

37:31.380 --> 37:32.972
What?

37:33.010 --> 37:35.274
It's good, that's what.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.947
You think Violet's
the only person

37:36.980 --> 37:39.016
- can make pie in St. Jo?
- Mm.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.848
She'd cut you
if she heard different.

37:41.890 --> 37:44.256
You're right about that.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.699
I owe you an apology.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.597
Remy, stop.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.359
I'm the one
who showed up at your door
unannounced tonight.

37:57.400 --> 38:01.029
I-- I should be the one
sayIng I'm sorry.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.402
I just meant
I was in a hurry.

38:04.510 --> 38:06.375
Trying to make up
for what feels like

38:06.410 --> 38:08.674
four years of lost time,
you know?

38:11.550 --> 38:14.587
Pushing you to make a choice
before you were ready...

38:17.960 --> 38:19.518
while you were
trying to figure out

38:19.560 --> 38:23.394
if what you had with Davis
was worth fighting for.

38:23.430 --> 38:24.567
It wasn't.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.707
I know that now.

38:33.740 --> 38:35.605
Maybe so.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.528
But it doesn't change
my part in it.

38:37.580 --> 38:40.549
You've got nothing
to apologize for, Remy.

38:40.580 --> 38:44.539
I appreciate that,
but I've been there.

38:44.590 --> 38:47.809
Hell, it feels like
I'm still there sometimes.

38:47.850 --> 38:51.354
So angry
about what I lost,

38:51.390 --> 38:53.051
about what was taken
from me.

38:53.090 --> 38:57.823
It just clouds everything
some days, you know?

38:59.770 --> 39:00.896
Yeah.

39:00.930 --> 39:02.830
( sighs )

39:15.020 --> 39:17.818
You are the first woman
that I wanted to know

39:17.850 --> 39:20.739
since my wife, Charley.

39:20.790 --> 39:23.850
And I want to know
everything.

39:23.890 --> 39:26.586
But before that can happen,

39:26.630 --> 39:29.599
you need to mourn
the loss of your marriage.

39:29.630 --> 39:33.361
You need to push past the anger
and allow yourself to grieve.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.571
* We share a story...

39:43.610 --> 39:44.975
Nova, faint:
We're here to advocate...

39:45.010 --> 39:48.377
* You are

39:49.650 --> 39:52.744
* We are

39:52.790 --> 39:56.112
*Iamyou

39:59.190 --> 40:01.727
*Iamyou

40:01.760 --> 40:08.495
* We share a story

40:08.540 --> 40:10.633
* We share a story

40:11.710 --> 40:14.577
* You are

40:16.040 --> 40:17.769
* We are...

40:17.810 --> 40:20.108
You're here.

40:20.150 --> 40:22.414
I just couldn't go
to school today.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.910
And I didn't know where to go
or what to do, so I just--

40:27.950 --> 40:30.453
It's okay, Micah.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.657
It's gonna be okay.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.193
( music continues )

40:45.840 --> 40:48.729
* You are

40:50.110 --> 40:53.045
* We are

40:53.080 --> 40:56.516
*Iamyou

40:57.680 --> 41:00.808
*Iamyou

41:03.260 --> 41:06.457
* You are

41:07.930 --> 41:10.899

41:12.730 --> 41:15.938
* I am you.
