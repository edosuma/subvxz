02:01.454 --> 02:02.580
Movement.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.949
Two men.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.993
Approximately

02:10.463 --> 02:12.226
40 goats.

02:12.332 --> 02:16.063
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

02:17.036 --> 02:18.162
Egress?

02:18.938 --> 02:23.739
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

02:25.111 --> 02:28.239
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

02:38.124 --> 02:41.093
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

02:42.061 --> 02:43.653
She sewed that herself.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.125
It's beautiful.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.565
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.068
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.067
This shit's awful calm.

03:09.589 --> 03:10.749
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.017
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.319
Yes, sir.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.754
Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.491
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.092
Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.104
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.538
I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.077
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

03:32.178 --> 03:34.009
Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

03:34.113 --> 03:37.480
possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.777
Call them out.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.219
Target.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.715
Sector Bravo, deep.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.086
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

03:45.191 --> 03:46.158
Range it.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.459
870 yards and closing.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.867
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

03:56.869 --> 04:00.066
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

04:01.608 --> 04:02.802
On target.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.240
Hold scope.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.675
Fire when ready.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.306
Hit.

04:16.122 --> 04:19.148
Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.659
Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.372
Call it in. It's time to go.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.375
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.501
- Packing up.
- Shit!

04:38.611 --> 04:41.978
Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.413
Weren't supposed to be
hostiles that close!

04:51.524 --> 04:55.824
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.861
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.302
Fire when ready.

05:10.710 --> 05:14.407
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.606
- I see it, Donnie. I see it.
- Fire when ready.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.792
- They don't know where we are.
- But they might get lucky!

05:31.197 --> 05:33.256
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.630
Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.465
Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.

05:38.571 --> 05:42.473
We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.644
Command Post, do you read me?

05:46.746 --> 05:47.974
Shut it down.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.214
They're highly-trained men,

05:49.315 --> 05:52.079
eight kilometers inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.517
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.087
Radio check. Do you read me?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.248
- Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
- Do you read me?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.020
- Pull out those tracks.
- Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

06:12.939 --> 06:14.998
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

06:15.108 --> 06:16.234
Call it in!

06:19.445 --> 06:22.380
Shit! The channel's down!

06:22.482 --> 06:23.506
That's impossible!

06:23.616 --> 06:25.015
The comm link's dead!

06:25.118 --> 06:27.951
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

07:09.629 --> 07:10.789
Donnie?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.627
Donnie!

08:43.256 --> 08:44.689
Come on, boy!

08:46.459 --> 08:47.721
Come on, Sam!

08:49.529 --> 08:51.656
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

08:51.764 --> 08:52.788
Come on.

08:52.899 --> 08:53.991
What? I got nothing.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.167
What?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.362
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.105
That's a good boy.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.778
Good boy.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.395
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.359
Here, boy.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.999
Good boy.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.045
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.644
USMC, retired.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.119
He is the best there is.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.818
His last assignment went wrong.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.226
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.767
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.700
His best friend and spotter was killed.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.066
No official report.

10:06.172 --> 10:10.404
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.602
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

10:12.712 --> 10:15.875
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.882
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.747
He retired a week later.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.946
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.390
Grows and shoots his own food.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.696
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.933
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.738
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

10:45.845 --> 10:49.246
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.678
Bob Lee is one of those.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.055
You sure, boy?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.834
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

11:19.945 --> 11:23.642
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.917
Bob Lee Swagger?

11:27.019 --> 11:29.044
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

11:29.455 --> 11:30.717
You're a hard man to find.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.085
But not hard enough.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.715
Come a long way to see you.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.028
We have some business
needs your attention.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.686
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

11:37.797 --> 11:38.889
or your brakes'll go.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.865
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.368
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.963
That's a slow draw you got there.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.508
Sure you want to do that?

11:50.943 --> 11:52.433
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

11:52.545 --> 11:54.877
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.106
He understands.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.141
Take your hand off your weapon.

11:59.251 --> 12:00.377
Slowly.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.622
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.587
I don't carry a gun.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.090
You know what that is?

12:13.199 --> 12:15.133
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.225
They don't hand those out easy.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.370
Yours?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.070
Yeah.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.163
Your father had one, didn't he?

12:22.274 --> 12:23.798
What did you do?

12:23.909 --> 12:27.640
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.510
Will you give me five minutes?

12:31.984 --> 12:33.713
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.547
Come on, boy. Get in there.

12:37.957 --> 12:42.189
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.318
Whose president?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.453
Ours.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.463
I didn't say "execute".

12:48.234 --> 12:49.201
Plan.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.061
So it can be stopped.

12:52.171 --> 12:55.800
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

12:55.908 --> 12:59.241
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.910
It was internal.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.381
We can't go to the usual agencies.

13:05.484 --> 13:08.317
The government itself
has been penetrated.

13:08.420 --> 13:13.881
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

13:13.993 --> 13:18.487
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

13:18.597 --> 13:21.430
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

13:21.734 --> 13:24.362
is out to 880 yards.

13:24.470 --> 13:29.134
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

13:29.241 --> 13:32.233
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

13:32.611 --> 13:34.101
so we could stop it.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.608
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.115
But let's not take the chance.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.551
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.559
That's because long shots
generally go places

13:48.661 --> 13:51.494
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.191
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.298
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

13:57.403 --> 13:58.927
Everything comes into play that far.

13:59.038 --> 14:02.132
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.572
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

14:03.676 --> 14:05.769
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.972
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.311
President'll be wearing body amour.
That means a headshot,

14:11.417 --> 14:12.577
at over a mile.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.949
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

14:15.054 --> 14:16.282
Yes.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.754
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.227
That's being worked on
from another direction.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.088
We need you to do this.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.163
Don't really like the President much.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.164
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.131
You like the idea of the President?

14:29.501 --> 14:30.968
Living in a free country?

14:31.070 --> 14:33.504
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

14:33.606 --> 14:35.369
Sure, some years we do.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.476
I believe you stood before a flag

14:39.979 --> 14:41.241
and solemnly swore

14:42.147 --> 14:46.015
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

14:46.118 --> 14:47.779
against all enemies,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.514
foreign and domestic.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.556
I think your five minutes is up.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.557
Listen to me, son.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.764
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

15:07.973 --> 15:10.271
and see the President dead,

15:10.376 --> 15:13.038
and know you could've done
something about it.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.904
Don't do that to yourself.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.499
Is that the new one?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.866
The truck.

15:41.373 --> 15:42.840
You got the big engine in there?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.503
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.309
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.974
You mind if I take a picture?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.310
This is beautiful.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.555
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.361
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.767
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.395
He's trained in counterintel.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.838
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.432
This is our guy.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.943
I thought he turned you down.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.479
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.416
1,760's a mile.

17:40.292 --> 17:43.887
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

18:15.727 --> 18:17.319
Yeah, I think he better worry.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.806
Yeah, he'll be fine.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.939
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.313
Yep. I'm out.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.554
Come here, buddy.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.483
Okay.

18:46.191 --> 18:49.649
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

18:50.496 --> 18:51.463
Yeah.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.777
This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.717
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

20:22.821 --> 20:25.619
Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.

20:38.604 --> 20:43.371
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

20:43.475 --> 20:46.376
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.609
Built in 1732...

20:48.714 --> 20:50.841
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

20:50.949 --> 20:53.247
...both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

20:53.352 --> 20:55.513
were debated and signed here.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.085
Out of the three cities,

21:05.197 --> 21:08.132
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.028
There was no room in Baltimore.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.568
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

21:11.670 --> 21:13.433
buildings are in the way.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.062
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

21:15.173 --> 21:17.299
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

21:17.409 --> 21:18.433
waiting for him in the afterlife,

21:18.543 --> 21:20.067
I'd rule that out.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.304
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.014
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.583
It's one of six possible locations,

21:25.684 --> 21:28.619
approximately five stories
above the President's location.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.849
Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.185
They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,

21:33.292 --> 21:34.816
several lines into his speech.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.724
That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.763
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.629
Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.031
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

21:44.136 --> 21:45.160
touch more slippery.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.760
Least that's what I'd do.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.204
You can kill him from that far away?

21:51.209 --> 21:53.177
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

21:53.278 --> 21:54.472
than a .44 Magnum point blank.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.274
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.144
The challenge is the wind.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.115
Lightest breeze uncorrected
at that distance

22:00.218 --> 22:01.515
is enough to ruin the shot.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.817
He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.

22:04.923 --> 22:06.413
Velocity corrections are easy,

22:06.525 --> 22:08.322
but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.395
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.464
Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.625
Impressive recon and report, son.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.760
Move too soon, we lose him.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.167
We want to take him alive.

22:20.806 --> 22:23.798
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

22:25.110 --> 22:29.376
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.073
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

22:32.184 --> 22:33.310
A moment?

22:35.487 --> 22:37.955
You've done your country
a great service, son.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.045
- On the day...
- Look...

22:39.157 --> 22:40.215
Listen.

22:41.293 --> 22:44.626
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.462
I could use a spotter.

23:54.332 --> 23:56.266
Thank you, Philadelphia.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.461
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.197
...before you on this stage...

24:00.305 --> 24:02.967
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

24:03.074 --> 24:06.168
...patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.041
the Declaration of Independence...

24:08.146 --> 24:09.272
Sir?

24:09.381 --> 24:11.008
...and a country,
the United States of America,

24:11.116 --> 24:12.549
that changed the world.

24:12.651 --> 24:14.983
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

24:15.086 --> 24:16.883
Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.752
Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.350
All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.

24:24.262 --> 24:26.856
- Stand by.
- Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.229
Copy that.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.706
Post 18 clear, over.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.437
Post 19, please report.
What's your status?

24:41.246 --> 24:43.874
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.417
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

24:46.518 --> 24:49.009
The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

24:49.120 --> 24:51.782
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

24:51.890 --> 24:54.450
There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop

24:54.559 --> 24:57.722
as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.195
He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony

25:00.298 --> 25:01.629
to discuss these matters.

25:01.733 --> 25:04.031
These are great times.

25:05.036 --> 25:07.266
These are historic times.

25:07.372 --> 25:10.671
And these are troubled times, as well.

25:11.977 --> 25:14.810
This medal that your country...

25:14.913 --> 25:16.141
Yellow ribbons.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.808
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

25:18.917 --> 25:21.147
No, they tie those low around trees.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.420
These are windage flags.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.087
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

25:25.190 --> 25:26.680
for a shot from the steeple.

25:26.825 --> 25:29.055
Yeah. Maybe.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.219
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.263
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.198
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

25:36.301 --> 25:39.964
...raises its head
and confronts freedom,

25:40.071 --> 25:45.407
but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.

25:45.510 --> 25:49.207
And it is our responsibility

25:49.314 --> 25:51.544
to find these dark weeds.

25:52.217 --> 25:56.313
Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.386
- If you just joined us...
- Hi.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.120
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

26:04.429 --> 26:05.726
Bob Lee Swagger.

26:07.465 --> 26:10.593
It is a real honor to meet you.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.397
You're unsnapped, officer.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.863
Shit. Oh, fuck.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.238
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

26:18.343 --> 26:20.834
Again, it's an honor.

26:23.748 --> 26:28.811
...of our stewardship of this great...

26:28.920 --> 26:32.447
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.821
He's getting a medal. Know it?

26:34.926 --> 26:37.019
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

26:37.128 --> 26:39.096
You know I worked there?

26:39.197 --> 26:40.994
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

26:41.099 --> 26:43.033
when you shoot a civilian, right?

26:43.134 --> 26:45.432
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.004
That's very original.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.374
Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.966
The President speaks next.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.340
All teams stand by.

26:55.814 --> 26:59.773
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.545
Agent James, all clear.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.678
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

27:03.788 --> 27:05.722
- Got wind at three, full value.
- ...to introduce to you

27:05.857 --> 27:07.791
the President of the United States.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.985
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.954
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.216
He's loaded.

27:38.323 --> 27:42.259
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.961
In the city that was the capital of...

27:46.064 --> 27:47.531
We got to take him.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.099
Ten seconds.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.862
Wind matches his setup.
Take him! Take him now!

27:51.970 --> 27:53.369
Send in the ERT team. Take out the...

27:55.974 --> 27:57.464
Shots fired! Shots fired!

28:12.824 --> 28:15.054
Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.253
- What? Flashlight down?
- I say again. Flashlight is down.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.388
- The President has been shot.
- There's mass confusion...

28:20.665 --> 28:22.633
Has the President been shot?

28:25.303 --> 28:26.497
Right at the church steeple.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.301
How could you miss?

28:32.177 --> 28:33.872
How could you fucking miss?

28:33.978 --> 28:37.141
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

28:37.248 --> 28:38.840
He's bleeding. Kill him.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.882
Command Post to Condor Two,
load up, over.

28:42.987 --> 28:44.454
Condor Two loading up.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.117
Go, go, go, go, go!

28:55.500 --> 28:57.400
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

29:09.314 --> 29:12.215
Condor Two, this is Command Post.
Stand by for update, over.

29:12.317 --> 29:13.682
Standing by, over.

29:15.453 --> 29:16.750
Command Post!

29:18.490 --> 29:20.185
Command Post!
Command Post, this is Post 19.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.315
You guys read me?

29:21.426 --> 29:22.484
- Should I hold post?
- Please.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.858
Please help me. Please. They shot me.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.227
- FBI. Put your hands up!
- Please. Hey.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.434
Save me.

29:31.569 --> 29:32.536
What?

29:40.745 --> 29:42.110
Give me the keys.

29:42.213 --> 29:44.875
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

29:46.484 --> 29:47.610
Help!

29:49.154 --> 29:51.452
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.

29:56.394 --> 29:59.056
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

29:59.164 --> 30:02.998
CP, 17, can you repeat
possible suspect description?

30:03.101 --> 30:05.126
Negative, no further at this time.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.761
CP, this is 15.
No activity at my location.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.931
I am available to move if necessary.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.372
Copy that.

30:15.246 --> 30:17.510
This is Officer Timmons
requesting backup.

30:17.615 --> 30:19.549
Pursuing suspect in assassination.

30:19.651 --> 30:23.781
Now fleeing in stolen FBI vehicle,
moving south on Front from Diamond.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.514
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
I repeat,

30:26.191 --> 30:27.749
suspect is armed and dangerous.

30:27.859 --> 30:30.225
All Philly PD units be advised,

30:30.328 --> 30:33.229
assassination suspect is fleeing
in a stolen FBI vehicle.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.027
He is going south
on Front from Diamond.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.103
This is Condor 2. We are transitioning
from roadhouse to Front Street.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.399
Please advise for further description
of suspect vehicle.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.805
Dispatch, 419,
I'm heading south on Thompson.

30:44.909 --> 30:46.968
Do we have a color,
anything on the vehicle?

30:52.617 --> 30:55.245
Assassination suspect's vehicle

30:55.353 --> 30:59.187
is one government-issue
black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.

30:59.290 --> 31:04.956
Pennsylvania license number
7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.190
What was suspect's
last known location? Over.

31:08.299 --> 31:10.494
Last known is south on Front.

31:16.808 --> 31:20.335
This is Agent James. Do we have
multiple suspects or a single suspect?

31:21.279 --> 31:24.942
Agent James, negative.
No further information...

31:25.049 --> 31:28.678
This is Agent Pittman.
Car seen going high speed on Castor.

31:28.786 --> 31:30.845
High speed on Castor. Be advised.

31:37.629 --> 31:38.823
Timmons called it in?

31:38.930 --> 31:41.160
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.995
- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

31:43.101 --> 31:45.831
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

31:45.937 --> 31:47.063
it doesn't really matter.

31:47.171 --> 31:51.130
They're going to find him lying dead
by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.

31:51.309 --> 31:52.276
What is your location?

32:03.488 --> 32:06.719
Suspect vehicle a black sedan,
four-door...

32:22.674 --> 32:23.698
All units be advised,

32:23.808 --> 32:27.244
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle
entering High-Tech Car Wash

32:27.345 --> 32:30.178
on the northwest corner
of Girard and 9th, over.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.248
Command Post be advised,

32:31.349 --> 32:33.783
this is Condor Two en route
to suspect location, over.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.376
Command Post, Condor Three copies.
All en route.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.854
- Yo, man!
- Watch it, man!

33:03.181 --> 33:04.239
Shit!

33:20.832 --> 33:23.892
Command Post, Condors Two
and Three moving to intercept, over.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.261
Suspect vehicle collided with a truck
under the 95.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.167
He's at Market and Columbus.

34:03.174 --> 34:06.507
Looks good. Vehicle is disabled.
Repeat, vehicle disabled.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.512
Take him down! Fire!

34:43.614 --> 34:46.879
I got a Crown Vic. Black.
Government plates.

34:46.984 --> 34:49.077
Dead guy in the front seat?

34:52.590 --> 34:56.686
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.862
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.211
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.886
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

37:06.591 --> 37:09.025
The would-be assassin,
tentatively identified

37:09.126 --> 37:12.618
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

37:12.730 --> 37:17.292
is being pursued by thousands of State
and Federal law enforcement personnel

37:17.401 --> 37:18.595
as we speak.

37:18.703 --> 37:22.434
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.838
Nothing but an abandoned car
has been found

37:24.942 --> 37:26.807
at the bottom of the Delaware River.

37:26.911 --> 37:30.540
Seven-year veteran Philadelphia
police officer Stanley Timmons,

37:30.648 --> 37:32.138
first to respond to the scene,

37:32.250 --> 37:35.242
is believed to have shot
and injured Swagger.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.514
Early reports indicate that the assailant

37:37.622 --> 37:40.614
may have been hit
as many as two times.

37:40.725 --> 37:43.455
Meanwhile, the FBI has been
unwilling to comment

37:43.561 --> 37:45.859
on information that an agent of theirs

37:45.963 --> 37:50.093
was assaulted and disarmed
by Swagger as he fled the scene,

37:50.201 --> 37:52.669
possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.

37:52.770 --> 37:56.297
At this time, no sign of Swagger
has been found.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.466
You have embarrassed this office.

37:58.576 --> 38:02.979
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.069
Sir...

38:05.583 --> 38:07.380
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.419
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

38:09.520 --> 38:12.421
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

38:12.523 --> 38:15.686
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

38:23.234 --> 38:25.634
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

38:25.736 --> 38:27.101
Because he didn't.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.842
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

38:33.944 --> 38:35.275
He never said that.

38:35.379 --> 38:37.506
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

38:37.615 --> 38:39.105
You got your ass kicked.

38:39.216 --> 38:40.615
You're misremembering.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.450
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.355
Have you given
your official statement yet?

38:46.457 --> 38:49.449
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

38:49.560 --> 38:53.724
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.999
Can you believe this fucking guy?

38:58.436 --> 38:59.596
There you go.

39:00.471 --> 39:01.460
- Yes?
- The raw feeds are in

39:01.572 --> 39:02.470
from the networks.

39:20.825 --> 39:24.420
...development, security camera footage
from Washington, D.C.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.496
and several locations in Philadelphia

39:26.597 --> 39:29.828
shows the suspect,
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,

39:29.934 --> 39:33.893
scouting shooting locations,
traveling and taking wind readings.

39:34.105 --> 39:38.872
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

40:08.506 --> 40:09.666
Excuse me.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.868
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

40:12.977 --> 40:15.207
Please. I got cash,
and you can keep the change.

40:15.312 --> 40:17.041
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.616
Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

40:19.717 --> 40:21.184
couple bottles of water.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.108
How many?

41:09.166 --> 41:12.192
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.794
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

41:14.905 --> 41:17.738
but we don't take care
of those things here.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.901
- Yeah. Okay, well...
- The FBI released a video letter...

41:20.010 --> 41:22.035
- ...see a counselor.
- ...threatening the life of the President...

41:22.146 --> 41:23.170
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.544
...signed and dated
by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.243
Federal agents today
executed a search warrant

41:28.352 --> 41:30.547
in the Wind River range of Wyoming

41:30.654 --> 41:33.555
where Swagger had been living
for several years.

41:33.657 --> 41:37.058
In the meantime, the FBI
has been unwilling to comment,

41:37.161 --> 41:39.493
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

41:40.531 --> 41:42.795
- Get anything?
- No.

42:44.528 --> 42:46.257
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

42:58.776 --> 42:59.800
And? Yes?

42:59.910 --> 43:03.073
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.511
- What'd he buy?
- Gotta be.

43:04.615 --> 43:07.607
Salt, sugar, water,
and a marinade injector.

43:07.718 --> 43:09.083
Guy going to a barbecue.

43:09.186 --> 43:11.780
Salt, water, an injector could be used
for an IV,

43:11.922 --> 43:12.946
but what's with the sugar?

43:13.057 --> 43:14.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

43:14.425 --> 43:16.017
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

43:16.126 --> 43:17.093
for hundreds of years.

43:17.194 --> 43:19.424
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.964
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

43:22.066 --> 43:24.534
You go into Howard's office
with the Napoleonic War,

43:24.635 --> 43:25.829
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.166
Go back to your desk.
I'm saving your life.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.094
One thing is...

43:57.434 --> 43:59.061
...1790 to 1800.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.371
One thing is...

45:17.781 --> 45:18.975
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.516
I know who you are.

45:20.617 --> 45:23.484
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

45:23.587 --> 45:26.215
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

45:26.323 --> 45:27.415
I know.

45:27.524 --> 45:28.513
You do?

45:28.625 --> 45:32.152
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.758
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

45:37.501 --> 45:38.627
Look, you're a nurse, right?

45:38.736 --> 45:43.332
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.634
I teach the third grade.

45:45.342 --> 45:46.934
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

45:47.044 --> 45:48.136
Please.

45:48.345 --> 45:49.403
Please?

45:49.747 --> 45:51.738
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

45:52.349 --> 45:53.316
I swear.

45:53.817 --> 45:56.047
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

45:56.153 --> 45:58.678
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

46:02.159 --> 46:04.855
You still figuring on shooting me?

46:04.962 --> 46:07.760
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

46:07.865 --> 46:10.993
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.069
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

46:16.306 --> 46:20.037
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

46:20.144 --> 46:21.668
You'd best call me Sarah.

46:21.779 --> 46:22.973
All right.

46:38.295 --> 46:40.456
911, what's your emergency?

47:09.159 --> 47:10.183
Hello?

47:10.294 --> 47:12.125
This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.

47:12.229 --> 47:14.754
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over
the trash cans

47:14.865 --> 47:17.356
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

47:17.467 --> 47:18.434
Okay, then.

47:24.541 --> 47:27.704
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

47:27.811 --> 47:29.870
they call you back right away.

47:36.119 --> 47:38.485
I should've come
and seen you in person.

47:41.558 --> 47:43.890
Before. I mean, then.

47:43.994 --> 47:45.359
Yeah, I read the letter.

47:47.431 --> 47:48.728
It was okay.

47:50.801 --> 47:52.996
And once a year I got the flowers.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.029
You don't look real good.

47:58.475 --> 48:02.343
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

48:02.446 --> 48:04.414
Why aren't you?

48:04.514 --> 48:06.880
Well, the U.S. government spent
a lot of time and money

48:06.984 --> 48:08.781
teaching me how not to die

48:08.886 --> 48:11.377
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

48:12.756 --> 48:15.088
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

48:16.360 --> 48:20.558
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

48:20.664 --> 48:21.631
Yeah.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.566
You got to try to spread it out.

48:33.677 --> 48:36.043
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

48:44.153 --> 48:46.986
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

48:50.893 --> 48:52.520
Mileage can be rough.

49:03.906 --> 49:05.669
No one ever beats me in.

49:13.048 --> 49:14.310
You never left.

49:15.217 --> 49:17.344
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

49:17.453 --> 49:20.581
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

49:21.657 --> 49:24.125
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

49:25.494 --> 49:27.621
Where did all this stuff come from?

49:28.364 --> 49:31.424
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

49:31.534 --> 49:35.436
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

49:35.538 --> 49:39.941
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

49:40.042 --> 49:42.840
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

49:43.445 --> 49:44.571
You need to get some sleep.

49:44.680 --> 49:47.444
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

49:47.550 --> 49:49.381
22 minutes after the shooting.

49:49.485 --> 49:50.509
We're good at our jobs.

49:50.619 --> 49:53.087
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

49:53.189 --> 49:54.315
The scene was locked down.

49:55.658 --> 49:58.923
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

49:59.028 --> 50:00.120
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

50:00.229 --> 50:01.560
We're not that good at our jobs.

50:02.431 --> 50:04.023
- You want to see something?
- Probably not.

50:04.133 --> 50:05.498
I downloaded this.

50:05.601 --> 50:06.727
This is a full-scale printout

50:06.835 --> 50:09.827
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

50:09.939 --> 50:13.204
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

50:13.309 --> 50:18.042
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

50:18.147 --> 50:19.341
Five shots,

50:19.682 --> 50:20.910
at 1,000 yards,

50:21.150 --> 50:23.414
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

50:25.788 --> 50:27.278
It was the capital of the United States...

50:27.389 --> 50:30.916
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

50:31.026 --> 50:32.459
This is the wind speed and direction

50:32.561 --> 50:33.823
according to the
National Weather Service

50:33.929 --> 50:36.227
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

50:36.332 --> 50:38.960
Now, how does a man who can do that

50:39.802 --> 50:43.033
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

50:43.706 --> 50:44.832
I don't get it.

50:44.940 --> 50:47.773
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

50:47.876 --> 50:50.003
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

50:50.112 --> 50:52.342
He said he was walking foot patrol,

50:52.448 --> 50:55.042
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

50:55.150 --> 50:57.983
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

50:58.087 --> 50:59.987
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

51:00.089 --> 51:02.853
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

51:03.225 --> 51:05.159
It doesn't make any sense.

51:07.396 --> 51:09.057
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

51:09.164 --> 51:11.257
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

51:12.167 --> 51:14.863
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

51:18.974 --> 51:21.033
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

51:21.677 --> 51:23.542
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

51:23.646 --> 51:25.637
Bad things happen to good people.

51:25.748 --> 51:26.772
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

51:32.821 --> 51:35.221
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

51:36.158 --> 51:38.388
But it'll cut loose again.

51:38.494 --> 51:41.793
I held off the worst of the infection,
but you're gonna have to open it up,

51:41.897 --> 51:44.695
cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

51:44.800 --> 51:47.667
working your way out,
sewing it together

51:47.770 --> 51:50.568
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

51:53.008 --> 51:54.441
You ready for this?

51:56.779 --> 51:59.475
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s
and pass out.

52:02.651 --> 52:03.982
Good luck, okay?

53:17.960 --> 53:21.361
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

53:21.463 --> 53:22.896
That our guy in the collar?

53:22.998 --> 53:24.226
Whose president?

53:24.333 --> 53:25.732
I didn't say "execute".

53:25.834 --> 53:28.735
He's getting a medal. Know it?

53:28.837 --> 53:31.067
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

53:35.477 --> 53:36.967
You need to find the shooter.

53:40.315 --> 53:41.282
No.

55:34.630 --> 55:37.258
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

55:37.366 --> 55:38.765
Find me something.

55:38.867 --> 55:41.028
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

55:42.237 --> 55:43.898
He's not dead.

55:45.741 --> 55:47.140
Tear apart his life.

55:47.242 --> 55:48.573
Again.

55:53.782 --> 55:54.840
Go okay?

56:00.188 --> 56:01.553
I've been hallucinating.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.494
Something I need to tell you.

56:09.731 --> 56:11.562
Ralphie's dead.

56:11.667 --> 56:12.895
Who's Ralphie?

56:14.002 --> 56:15.469
Well, they said you shot your dog

56:15.571 --> 56:17.471
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

56:17.573 --> 56:19.040
They said that, huh?

56:23.445 --> 56:24.878
Name was Sam.

56:25.981 --> 56:28.449
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

56:32.521 --> 56:33.715
You okay?

56:35.691 --> 56:36.658
No.

56:37.826 --> 56:39.521
What are you gonna do?

56:40.996 --> 56:42.657
I'll get better.

56:44.533 --> 56:47.024
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

57:22.904 --> 57:23.996
Can I help you?

57:53.001 --> 57:54.127
Hold still.

58:05.747 --> 58:07.612
I been meaning to ask you.

58:08.350 --> 58:10.011
You have a boyfriend?

58:12.054 --> 58:13.078
Why?

58:14.289 --> 58:16.883
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

58:16.992 --> 58:18.653
It's been three years.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.727
No.

58:20.295 --> 58:21.728
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

58:21.830 --> 58:22.990
walks through that door
without knocking,

58:23.098 --> 58:25.032
wondering where you've been.

58:27.302 --> 58:28.894
Well, no.

58:29.004 --> 58:31.234
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

58:55.731 --> 58:57.028
Not bad.

58:58.300 --> 58:59.961
A little stiff, but...

59:01.770 --> 59:02.737
Hey.

59:03.972 --> 59:06.668
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

59:07.909 --> 59:09.774
That was really brave, what you did.

59:10.145 --> 59:11.305
You saved my life.

59:15.446 --> 59:18.108
I'm better. I better get to it.

59:18.216 --> 59:20.548
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

59:21.652 --> 59:22.744
Never.

59:24.021 --> 59:26.182
They're never gonna stop looking.

59:28.059 --> 59:31.324
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

59:31.429 --> 59:32.919
I'm going to give them him.

59:33.030 --> 59:34.497
Excuse me?

59:35.666 --> 59:38.760
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

59:47.278 --> 59:49.143
- Swagger?
- Hey.

59:58.956 --> 01:00:01.686
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:06.863
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

01:00:06.964 --> 01:00:09.398
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.558
You sure?

01:00:11.802 --> 01:00:12.769
Yeah.

01:00:17.108 --> 01:00:18.473
Why'd you go?

01:00:19.243 --> 01:00:21.006
When they came to see you.

01:00:23.414 --> 01:00:25.575
They know which buttons to press.

01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:28.476
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

01:00:28.586 --> 01:00:32.181
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
"Which way you want me to go, boss?"

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:35.919
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

01:00:37.295 --> 01:00:38.660
You know, I got a plan,

01:00:40.097 --> 01:00:42.361
but I think I'm going to need your help.

01:00:42.533 --> 01:00:44.467
Okay. I'll do it.

01:00:45.169 --> 01:00:47.501
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

01:00:48.072 --> 01:00:49.198
I know.

01:00:57.081 --> 01:00:58.173
Look.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.484
It was my fault.

01:01:03.287 --> 01:01:04.254
What?

01:01:07.825 --> 01:01:09.986
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

01:01:17.068 --> 01:01:18.057
What?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.867
Don't you dare.

01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:29.971
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

01:01:31.015 --> 01:01:34.746
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

01:01:34.852 --> 01:01:35.944
He knew exactly what he was doing

01:01:36.053 --> 01:01:38.817
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

01:01:40.558 --> 01:01:42.492
He loved what he did.

01:01:42.593 --> 01:01:44.561
No one made him do it.

01:01:46.998 --> 01:01:49.125
That ain't yours to carry.

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.664
You're right.

01:01:55.272 --> 01:01:56.705
I'm sorry I tried.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.862
It's okay.

01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:32.138
I need you to meet with this FBI agent.

01:02:32.243 --> 01:02:35.007
Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.

01:02:35.112 --> 01:02:39.105
Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.

01:02:39.216 --> 01:02:41.684
You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.

01:02:41.986 --> 01:02:43.578
You get caught, I get caught.

01:02:43.687 --> 01:02:45.245
You know what that is?

01:02:47.024 --> 01:02:49.754
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.157
Well, he's been staying with me.

01:02:51.262 --> 01:02:53.321
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:06.032
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

01:03:06.143 --> 01:03:07.735
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

01:03:07.845 --> 01:03:11.076
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

01:03:12.316 --> 01:03:15.217
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

01:03:46.851 --> 01:03:48.045
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

01:04:13.744 --> 01:04:15.644
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

01:04:22.887 --> 01:04:25.219
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

01:04:25.322 --> 01:04:26.482
and show me some ID.

01:04:30.594 --> 01:04:32.186
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:04:33.597 --> 01:04:35.360
Take your hat off, asshole!

01:04:44.475 --> 01:04:47.308
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

01:05:20.644 --> 01:05:21.872
Hey, how's it going?

01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:24.875
Hey, John.

01:05:48.405 --> 01:05:49.599
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

01:05:49.707 --> 01:05:51.641
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

01:05:54.111 --> 01:05:57.274
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

01:05:57.615 --> 01:06:03.315
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.411
in 45 minutes for a review.

01:06:05.522 --> 01:06:08.548
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.728
What do you think?

01:06:12.429 --> 01:06:14.863
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

01:06:14.965 --> 01:06:17.297
already edited together
to show the angles.

01:06:17.401 --> 01:06:18.493
Who delivered them?

01:06:18.602 --> 01:06:22.003
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

01:06:22.106 --> 01:06:24.074
They denied, which is a...

01:06:26.677 --> 01:06:29.840
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

01:06:29.947 --> 01:06:31.778
Of what?

01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:35.409
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

01:06:35.519 --> 01:06:36.645
Oh, come on, just tell me.

01:06:36.754 --> 01:06:38.244
You don't want to be here
for that review.

01:06:38.355 --> 01:06:41.916
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

01:06:50.768 --> 01:06:54.499
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:58.838
- Thank you.
- Go.

01:07:06.016 --> 01:07:08.007
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

01:07:08.118 --> 01:07:11.212
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

01:07:11.322 --> 01:07:13.790
We just traced it to a donut shop
with free WiFi.

01:07:13.891 --> 01:07:16.655
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.558
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

01:07:19.663 --> 01:07:22.257
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the donut shop

01:07:22.366 --> 01:07:24.891
only three blocks away
from the field office.

01:07:25.002 --> 01:07:28.062
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

01:07:28.172 --> 01:07:29.366
He lives in Philly.

01:07:29.606 --> 01:07:31.039
And he works for the FBI.

01:07:32.343 --> 01:07:33.674
Nicholas Memphis.

01:07:34.111 --> 01:07:37.569
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

01:07:37.681 --> 01:07:40.514
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

01:07:40.617 --> 01:07:42.414
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:43.508
They're definitely not government,

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.350
but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.

01:07:46.457 --> 01:07:47.651
These are contractors.

01:07:47.758 --> 01:07:50.249
I can't tell
what this company does, but...

01:07:52.129 --> 01:07:53.118
Hey.

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:54.197
Hey, hey, hey!

01:07:59.203 --> 01:08:00.363
Memphis?

01:08:00.471 --> 01:08:01.438
Memphis!

01:08:08.679 --> 01:08:10.544
For a man who didn't know much,

01:08:10.647 --> 01:08:13.946
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

01:08:14.051 --> 01:08:15.643
Get him some water.

01:08:24.795 --> 01:08:25.853
Good.

01:08:36.407 --> 01:08:37.635
Got to pee yet?

01:08:37.741 --> 01:08:39.606
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.008
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

01:08:42.112 --> 01:08:44.376
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:46.415
I'm not going to shoot myself.

01:08:47.251 --> 01:08:48.343
Sure you will.

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.819
Take him out. Get him ready.

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:51.888
No!

01:08:57.627 --> 01:08:58.754
That's my gun.

01:08:58.862 --> 01:08:59.886
Yeah.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.865
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:05.298
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

01:09:12.376 --> 01:09:13.899
Quit your struggling.

01:09:17.514 --> 01:09:21.314
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:27.518
Russo. Russo!

01:09:27.624 --> 01:09:29.251
Davis, get out here!

01:09:34.096 --> 01:09:36.224
What is the goddamn hold-up?

01:10:13.804 --> 01:10:17.035
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.232
Kill you?

01:10:18.342 --> 01:10:20.970
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

01:10:22.212 --> 01:10:25.010
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

01:10:33.257 --> 01:10:36.488
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

01:10:37.794 --> 01:10:39.921
Help me toss these boys in the water?

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:42.328
You set me up and you used me as bait!

01:10:42.432 --> 01:10:45.265
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

01:10:45.369 --> 01:10:46.393
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.596
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

01:10:48.705 --> 01:10:50.935
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:52.975
They can work out some kind of deal.

01:10:53.944 --> 01:10:56.811
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

01:10:56.914 --> 01:10:58.040
I don't think you understand.

01:10:58.148 --> 01:10:59.342
These boys killed my dog.

01:11:02.252 --> 01:11:05.187
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

01:11:05.289 --> 01:11:06.847
In the end, the law is all...

01:11:06.957 --> 01:11:09.653
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.057
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

01:11:11.161 --> 01:11:13.686
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

01:11:13.931 --> 01:11:15.091
And I'll be dead.

01:11:15.198 --> 01:11:17.132
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

01:11:17.234 --> 01:11:19.327
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

01:11:19.436 --> 01:11:22.667
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

01:11:22.773 --> 01:11:25.264
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:29.910
You know, I missed a meeting today

01:11:30.013 --> 01:11:33.471
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

01:11:33.584 --> 01:11:36.576
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

01:11:41.224 --> 01:11:42.623
I'll take his legs.

01:11:42.726 --> 01:11:44.387
It's a good call, Pork.

01:11:44.962 --> 01:11:47.760
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBI agent

01:11:47.864 --> 01:11:49.661
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

01:11:49.766 --> 01:11:50.733
No.

01:11:51.468 --> 01:11:55.370
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.502
With a .22.

01:12:00.477 --> 01:12:02.707
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

01:12:02.813 --> 01:12:04.246
And that young kid,

01:12:04.548 --> 01:12:06.072
FBI Agent

01:12:08.552 --> 01:12:09.746
Nick Memphis,

01:12:09.853 --> 01:12:13.653
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

01:12:13.757 --> 01:12:17.488
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

01:12:19.663 --> 01:12:20.630
What?

01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:22.892
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

01:12:23.367 --> 01:12:27.030
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:29.637
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.903
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:34.204
She went back to using
her maiden name,

01:12:34.311 --> 01:12:36.541
which is why we missed it the first time.

01:12:37.714 --> 01:12:39.477
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:41.642
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

01:12:41.752 --> 01:12:45.153
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

01:12:45.255 --> 01:12:46.916
It's just within driving range.

01:12:47.891 --> 01:12:50.587
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

01:12:58.368 --> 01:13:00.063
We've given Swagger a new war,

01:13:00.504 --> 01:13:01.971
he's found a new spotter.

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.967
This is about to get worse.

01:13:34.071 --> 01:13:35.698
I think we're here.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.068
Hey. Swagger.

01:13:42.479 --> 01:13:43.912
I think we're here.

01:13:47.017 --> 01:13:49.144
Welcome to Tennessee.

01:13:49.252 --> 01:13:51.379
Patron state of shooting stuff.

01:13:53.657 --> 01:13:55.090
Hey, who is this guy?

01:13:55.192 --> 01:13:58.719
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

01:13:58.829 --> 01:14:00.888
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

01:14:00.997 --> 01:14:02.055
than Smith And Wesson.

01:14:02.165 --> 01:14:04.656
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

01:14:04.768 --> 01:14:05.928
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

01:14:06.036 --> 01:14:09.631
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.032
Wisdom.

01:14:13.076 --> 01:14:14.703
You come to the wrong place.

01:14:14.811 --> 01:14:16.073
Maybe.

01:14:16.179 --> 01:14:17.771
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

01:14:17.881 --> 01:14:19.542
and have it match exactly to another.

01:14:19.649 --> 01:14:21.014
Could that be done?

01:14:21.118 --> 01:14:22.142
Take a seat.

01:14:23.019 --> 01:14:24.247
Have a chair, son.

01:14:28.525 --> 01:14:32.484
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

01:14:32.596 --> 01:14:34.086
could make the grooves match.

01:14:34.197 --> 01:14:36.529
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

01:14:36.633 --> 01:14:38.157
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:39.826
was completely mangled on impact.

01:14:39.936 --> 01:14:42.166
FBI match was metallurgical.

01:14:42.272 --> 01:14:43.432
Thank you, Mother.

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.940
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:48.533
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

01:14:51.481 --> 01:14:53.039
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

01:14:55.051 --> 01:14:58.214
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

01:14:59.122 --> 01:15:01.317
Red leather spine.

01:15:01.525 --> 01:15:04.392
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:09.463
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

01:15:29.152 --> 01:15:31.382
Yeah. Paper patching.

01:15:31.488 --> 01:15:34.651
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

01:15:34.758 --> 01:15:35.986
Paper-wrapped bullet.

01:15:36.092 --> 01:15:38.617
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

01:15:38.728 --> 01:15:41.754
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

01:15:41.865 --> 01:15:43.890
Leaves no traces when it hits.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.629
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

01:15:47.737 --> 01:15:49.034
I got another one.

01:15:49.773 --> 01:15:50.797
I thought you might.

01:15:50.907 --> 01:15:53.899
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:55.705
Who's alive that could do that?

01:15:56.279 --> 01:16:00.409
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

01:16:00.517 --> 01:16:03.645
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

01:16:03.753 --> 01:16:05.981
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

01:16:06.089 --> 01:16:07.556
Yeah, they said that, all right.

01:16:07.657 --> 01:16:11.354
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

01:16:12.362 --> 01:16:14.887
and WMDs were in Iraq,

01:16:14.998 --> 01:16:17.660
and Anna Nicole married for love!

01:16:19.636 --> 01:16:21.501
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

01:16:21.605 --> 01:16:22.663
How come?

01:16:22.772 --> 01:16:25.332
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:27.342
That's how a conspiracy works.

01:16:27.444 --> 01:16:31.073
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:35.117
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

01:16:35.218 --> 01:16:36.651
And you know this for a fact?

01:16:36.753 --> 01:16:38.550
Still got the shovel.

01:16:40.724 --> 01:16:42.555
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:44.183
There was a guy in Russia.

01:16:44.294 --> 01:16:46.057
They locked his ass up.

01:16:46.763 --> 01:16:49.425
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:52.198
There was one guy,

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:54.566
but he don't shoot no more.

01:16:54.938 --> 01:16:57.702
A brutal son of a bitch.

01:16:57.807 --> 01:17:00.935
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

01:17:01.678 --> 01:17:03.373
wait till his friends come to help,

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.940
kill them too.

01:17:05.048 --> 01:17:07.209
Turned one target into four.

01:17:07.984 --> 01:17:11.715
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

01:17:11.821 --> 01:17:14.085
The other side wanted him. Bad.

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:19.492
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-story building.

01:17:20.697 --> 01:17:22.631
They quit the subtle tactics.

01:17:22.732 --> 01:17:25.360
They called in an artillery strike.

01:17:25.468 --> 01:17:27.368
Leveled a square block.

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:29.631
Brought the building down on his ass.

01:17:29.739 --> 01:17:32.173
Some say he crawled out of there.

01:17:32.275 --> 01:17:34.004
Some say he died.

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:36.044
Never heard from him no more.

01:17:36.746 --> 01:17:38.304
Fuck me.

01:17:38.415 --> 01:17:39.404
What?

01:17:39.516 --> 01:17:40.949
I met the son of a bitch.

01:17:45.422 --> 01:17:48.448
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

01:17:49.426 --> 01:17:50.552
No, sir.

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.252
You keep that in mind.

01:17:52.362 --> 01:17:54.125
The moment you think you got it figured,

01:17:54.297 --> 01:17:55.264
you're wrong.

01:17:59.336 --> 01:18:00.394
He got a name?

01:18:05.909 --> 01:18:07.342
Hey, it's me, Nick.

01:18:07.444 --> 01:18:10.379
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

01:18:11.114 --> 01:18:13.105
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

01:18:13.216 --> 01:18:14.444
It's better I don't tell you.

01:18:15.285 --> 01:18:17.651
Look, do you have a pen?

01:18:17.754 --> 01:18:20.222
I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

01:18:20.323 --> 01:18:21.290
- Yeah.
- You got it?

01:18:21.391 --> 01:18:22.380
I got it.

01:18:22.525 --> 01:18:24.356
Man, this is hard to spell.

01:18:30.567 --> 01:18:33.730
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

01:18:33.837 --> 01:18:36.101
He'll try to track the shooter.

01:18:36.206 --> 01:18:37.730
He won't get far that way.

01:18:37.841 --> 01:18:39.331
Yes, he will.

01:18:39.442 --> 01:18:41.535
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

01:18:41.644 --> 01:18:44.704
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

01:18:51.855 --> 01:18:53.550
And what happens to the bait?

01:18:55.091 --> 01:18:56.456
Hard to say.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.122
But that's the nature of being the bait.

01:19:13.176 --> 01:19:15.542
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?
- He's in Virginia.

01:19:16.613 --> 01:19:18.706
An end we thought was tied up

01:19:18.915 --> 01:19:20.007
came untied.

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:22.611
Meaning, Colonel?

01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:24.550
Swagger is still alive.

01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:29.356
Oh, my.

01:19:29.993 --> 01:19:34.623
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

01:19:36.299 --> 01:19:39.894
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

01:19:41.704 --> 01:19:43.467
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

01:19:43.573 --> 01:19:46.565
Twenty-four good, hard men.

01:19:46.676 --> 01:19:48.837
Weapons and gear.

01:19:48.945 --> 01:19:50.469
Only 24?

01:19:51.915 --> 01:19:53.314
Do kill him.

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:56.985
No loose ends this time.

01:19:57.887 --> 01:19:59.286
Night, Colonel.

01:20:00.957 --> 01:20:01.946
Good night, Senator.

01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:21.868
Hello?

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.479
Someone there?

01:21:01.751 --> 01:21:02.877
Now look.

01:21:03.586 --> 01:21:05.383
Look what you've done now.

01:21:08.658 --> 01:21:10.091
Give me that.

01:21:10.193 --> 01:21:13.185
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:23.535
Where's your boyfriend?

01:21:25.775 --> 01:21:27.367
What if it's a trap?

01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:29.175
Oh, it's a trap.

01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:31.611
Guaranteed. Every time.

01:21:33.483 --> 01:21:35.178
Question is, for whom?

01:21:36.686 --> 01:21:38.517
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

01:21:38.621 --> 01:21:40.851
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

01:22:08.918 --> 01:22:09.885
Let's go.

01:22:15.425 --> 01:22:17.450
Okay, so what are these for again?

01:22:18.161 --> 01:22:19.856
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

01:22:19.963 --> 01:22:21.521
Right.

01:22:21.631 --> 01:22:25.863
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

01:22:25.969 --> 01:22:29.996
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

01:22:30.106 --> 01:22:32.267
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:33.808
For as much as we can be.

01:22:46.956 --> 01:22:49.186
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

01:22:49.292 --> 01:22:51.021
Take them one by one.

01:22:51.127 --> 01:22:53.061
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

01:23:01.671 --> 01:23:02.729
Fuck!

01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:07.475
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

01:23:07.577 --> 01:23:10.102
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

01:23:26.195 --> 01:23:27.719
No. No.

01:23:28.264 --> 01:23:30.095
It's just you and me, baby.

01:23:30.199 --> 01:23:31.257
No!

01:23:34.337 --> 01:23:35.804
You got three guards.

01:23:36.706 --> 01:23:38.139
One at your 2:00,

01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:40.634
12:00

01:23:42.011 --> 01:23:43.137
and 10:00.

01:23:51.754 --> 01:23:52.778
Danger close. 2:00,

01:23:52.889 --> 01:23:53.856
fifty yards.

01:24:57.487 --> 01:24:58.545
You got one right on you.

01:24:58.988 --> 01:24:59.955
20 yards and closing.

01:25:50.673 --> 01:25:52.072
Go check the perimeter.

01:25:52.508 --> 01:25:54.032
And tell the others to stay alert.

01:25:54.143 --> 01:25:55.872
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:31.536
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

01:26:50.266 --> 01:26:51.563
You killed all three?

01:26:52.502 --> 01:26:53.833
There were four.

01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:58.228
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

01:26:58.341 --> 01:27:00.206
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

01:27:00.309 --> 01:27:01.742
to kill the Archbishop.

01:27:02.678 --> 01:27:04.168
Aren't you the one that shot him?

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.339
And if I don't know any of those things?

01:27:06.449 --> 01:27:07.541
Then you're of no worth to me

01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:09.811
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

01:27:14.023 --> 01:27:16.423
Johnson's had a lot of names.

01:27:16.526 --> 01:27:20.292
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

01:27:20.396 --> 01:27:22.125
Knowing would only be dangerous.

01:27:23.799 --> 01:27:25.323
He's ex-army.

01:27:25.434 --> 01:27:27.868
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

01:27:31.173 --> 01:27:32.265
Go on.

01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:36.874
They came for me,
like they came for you.

01:27:38.047 --> 01:27:40.447
Recruitment for a single job.

01:27:42.151 --> 01:27:43.584
They like the wounded.

01:27:44.687 --> 01:27:46.348
Easier to use

01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:49.358
and then throw away
when you are done.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.751
Timmons, you, me...

01:27:55.398 --> 01:28:00.335
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

01:28:01.437 --> 01:28:06.204
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

01:28:07.276 --> 01:28:08.607
And the Archbishop?

01:28:10.246 --> 01:28:14.080
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:16.750
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

01:28:18.187 --> 01:28:19.620
What was he going to say?

01:28:20.656 --> 01:28:21.987
The truth.

01:28:22.091 --> 01:28:25.652
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:29.253
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

01:28:29.365 --> 01:28:31.356
Over there, and here.

01:28:33.469 --> 01:28:35.266
The problem isn't the doing.

01:28:36.772 --> 01:28:38.865
It's the people in power having to admit

01:28:39.342 --> 01:28:40.434
that they knew.

01:28:42.211 --> 01:28:45.009
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

01:28:45.114 --> 01:28:47.275
and only the underlings go to jail.

01:28:48.017 --> 01:28:49.609
Their bosses knew.

01:28:49.719 --> 01:28:51.846
We know their bosses knew.

01:28:51.954 --> 01:28:53.182
But you don't say it.

01:28:53.289 --> 01:28:55.018
What exactly happened in Africa?

01:28:55.124 --> 01:28:57.615
Somehow the villagers didn't think

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.760
that an oil pipeline

01:29:00.363 --> 01:29:03.127
was a good enough reason
to move their village

01:29:03.232 --> 01:29:06.668
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

01:29:06.769 --> 01:29:07.736
Drink?

01:29:07.837 --> 01:29:08.895
So they asked them all nicely to move

01:29:09.005 --> 01:29:10.370
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

01:29:10.473 --> 01:29:11.440
No.

01:29:11.674 --> 01:29:12.902
They didn't ask.

01:29:13.275 --> 01:29:14.640
They just killed them.

01:29:14.744 --> 01:29:15.711
All.

01:29:15.978 --> 01:29:18.947
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

01:29:19.048 --> 01:29:20.379
They'll just go.

01:29:32.194 --> 01:29:36.426
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

01:29:36.532 --> 01:29:40.229
men, women, children,

01:29:40.336 --> 01:29:44.966
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

01:29:46.742 --> 01:29:48.175
You should know.

01:29:48.277 --> 01:29:52.304
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

01:29:53.683 --> 01:29:56.447
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

01:30:05.594 --> 01:30:06.754
Who runs Johnson?

01:30:06.862 --> 01:30:09.255
A senator. From Montana, I think.

01:30:10.833 --> 01:30:12.460
You don't get it.

01:30:12.902 --> 01:30:14.995
There is no head to cut off.

01:30:16.172 --> 01:30:17.969
It's a conglomerate.

01:30:18.607 --> 01:30:21.371
If one of them betrays the principles

01:30:22.878 --> 01:30:25.108
of the accrual of money and power,

01:30:26.215 --> 01:30:27.910
the others betray him.

01:30:29.018 --> 01:30:30.542
What it is

01:30:32.822 --> 01:30:35.120
is human weakness.

01:30:36.492 --> 01:30:39.393
You can't kill that with a gun.

01:30:47.303 --> 01:30:48.270
Swagger.

01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:49.359
Swagger.

01:30:49.472 --> 01:30:52.270
You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.

01:30:53.075 --> 01:30:56.169
Had to keep you till they got here.

01:30:57.646 --> 01:31:00.945
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

01:31:01.717 --> 01:31:03.275
You would have known.

01:31:08.257 --> 01:31:11.556
By the way, they've got your woman.

01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:15.688
Swagger.

01:31:15.798 --> 01:31:19.256
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

01:31:21.036 --> 01:31:22.936
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
- Roger that.

01:31:55.004 --> 01:31:56.665
Swagger, I'm in position two.

01:31:57.573 --> 01:31:58.699
You got to get out of there.

01:31:58.808 --> 01:32:00.275
- They're all over the place.
- Hey!

01:32:00.876 --> 01:32:02.275
Calm down.

01:32:02.378 --> 01:32:04.869
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

01:32:05.181 --> 01:32:06.978
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

01:32:14.557 --> 01:32:15.524
Listen very carefully.

01:32:15.691 --> 01:32:17.318
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

01:32:17.426 --> 01:32:18.393
then the gas.

01:32:19.428 --> 01:32:21.191
Three, two, one...

01:32:51.093 --> 01:32:52.219
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

01:33:47.349 --> 01:33:48.338
Swagger!

01:33:55.591 --> 01:33:56.888
You got it.

01:34:08.237 --> 01:34:09.397
Swagger!

01:34:11.807 --> 01:34:13.365
Swagger!

01:34:14.076 --> 01:34:15.407
Swagger!

01:34:22.017 --> 01:34:23.882
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

01:34:23.986 --> 01:34:24.953
Okay.

01:34:25.054 --> 01:34:26.112
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:34:26.221 --> 01:34:27.245
Go!

01:34:30.726 --> 01:34:31.693
Come on!

01:35:00.122 --> 01:35:01.384
You got to gun it to that tree line.

01:35:01.690 --> 01:35:02.657
What?

01:35:02.825 --> 01:35:04.690
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

01:35:04.793 --> 01:35:06.124
Okay. Okay.

01:35:06.228 --> 01:35:08.093
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

01:35:09.865 --> 01:35:10.854
All right, go!

01:35:24.279 --> 01:35:25.769
Pull up! Pull up!

01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:42.819
Time to go!

01:36:00.716 --> 01:36:01.648
Let me take a look.

01:36:02.084 --> 01:36:03.051
Not right now.

01:36:03.652 --> 01:36:04.949
Morning, beautiful.

01:36:05.054 --> 01:36:07.284
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

01:36:07.389 --> 01:36:11.723
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

01:36:11.827 --> 01:36:15.456
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

01:36:15.564 --> 01:36:18.795
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

01:36:20.602 --> 01:36:24.038
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

01:36:24.506 --> 01:36:25.905
of the FBI.

01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:27.732
What? That's gotta be wrong.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.538
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

01:36:36.919 --> 01:36:38.147
what the fuck is going on?

01:36:44.159 --> 01:36:45.490
Great shot!

01:36:49.031 --> 01:36:51.556
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

01:36:51.667 --> 01:36:54.932
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

01:36:56.538 --> 01:36:58.005
Think what you want.

01:37:00.542 --> 01:37:04.501
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

01:37:06.315 --> 01:37:08.306
There's always a confused soul

01:37:08.417 --> 01:37:11.011
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

01:37:12.187 --> 01:37:15.315
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

01:37:17.659 --> 01:37:19.628
That's the hassle with democracy.

01:37:20.129 --> 01:37:21.153
Pull!

01:37:35.511 --> 01:37:37.445
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

01:37:37.546 --> 01:37:39.104
We need those results now.

01:37:39.214 --> 01:37:41.546
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna!... to the roadhouse.

01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:44.244
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

01:37:44.353 --> 01:37:47.516
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

01:37:47.623 --> 01:37:48.851
Start a trace.

01:37:49.758 --> 01:37:51.350
Got it. I'm on it.

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:53.690
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

01:37:53.962 --> 01:37:57.090
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.134
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

01:38:00.235 --> 01:38:02.829
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

01:38:03.572 --> 01:38:04.800
Got him.

01:38:04.907 --> 01:38:06.534
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

01:38:06.642 --> 01:38:09.440
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

01:38:09.545 --> 01:38:13.914
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

01:38:14.016 --> 01:38:15.916
Oh, no. I can't do that.

01:38:16.018 --> 01:38:17.007
Why?

01:38:17.119 --> 01:38:19.110
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

01:38:20.022 --> 01:38:22.388
- But we're the FBI, son.
- Yeah, I know.

01:38:22.791 --> 01:38:23.917
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

01:38:24.226 --> 01:38:25.318
Oh, Nick, wait...

01:38:25.427 --> 01:38:27.327
Son of a bitch.

01:38:27.429 --> 01:38:28.453
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

01:38:28.564 --> 01:38:29.656
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

01:38:29.765 --> 01:38:31.995
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

01:38:37.773 --> 01:38:38.740
This is Swagger.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.535
- Colonel Johnson here.
- Figured you'd be listening.

01:38:40.642 --> 01:38:43.042
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
- Colonel?

01:38:43.579 --> 01:38:44.546
If it is "Colonel"?

01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:46.106
It is.

01:38:47.616 --> 01:38:50.642
- I have something you want.
- Well, it seems so do I.

01:38:53.722 --> 01:38:58.489
Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

01:38:58.594 --> 01:39:01.290
Men, women, children.

01:39:02.464 --> 01:39:04.398
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

01:39:04.499 --> 01:39:05.966
I just want someone there I can trust.

01:39:06.068 --> 01:39:08.662
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:10.670
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

01:39:10.772 --> 01:39:13.172
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

01:39:13.275 --> 01:39:15.266
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

01:39:15.377 --> 01:39:18.710
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

01:39:18.814 --> 01:39:22.306
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

01:39:23.285 --> 01:39:25.082
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

01:39:25.387 --> 01:39:26.615
from Montana?

01:39:26.722 --> 01:39:29.555
Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?

01:39:31.326 --> 01:39:32.588
I don't think so.

01:39:32.694 --> 01:39:35.561
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

01:39:35.664 --> 01:39:38.292
Point 732. Point 648.

01:39:38.834 --> 01:39:40.028
And what the hell is that?

01:39:40.135 --> 01:39:43.298
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few meters of latitude and longitude,

01:39:43.405 --> 01:39:45.396
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

01:39:45.507 --> 01:39:46.838
with 400 bodies underneath.

01:39:47.542 --> 01:39:48.736
Where are we meeting?

01:39:50.412 --> 01:39:52.505
Somewhere I can see you,

01:39:53.582 --> 01:39:56.346
coming from a goddamn long way off.

01:41:04.853 --> 01:41:06.184
Where's your boy?

01:41:20.569 --> 01:41:22.196
Well, I'm here.

01:41:31.012 --> 01:41:32.036
He's here.

01:41:32.147 --> 01:41:33.444
Look, look, look.

01:41:34.282 --> 01:41:36.307
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

01:41:44.993 --> 01:41:47.086
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

01:41:57.372 --> 01:41:58.669
Okay.

01:42:42.217 --> 01:42:43.844
I think I broke a rib!

01:42:45.487 --> 01:42:46.681
Don't move!

01:42:47.122 --> 01:42:48.555
Is there anybody else?

01:42:49.157 --> 01:42:50.124
No.

01:43:17.052 --> 01:43:19.680
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

01:43:20.989 --> 01:43:22.980
You got no shot!

01:43:23.091 --> 01:43:26.492
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

01:43:29.264 --> 01:43:30.959
You got no shot!

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.398
What are you gonna do? Come on!

01:43:43.378 --> 01:43:45.039
It's over for you, buddy!

01:43:50.085 --> 01:43:52.713
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

01:44:06.735 --> 01:44:08.259
Not bad!

01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:10.565
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

01:44:13.008 --> 01:44:14.134
Christ.

01:44:31.993 --> 01:44:33.085
How can we help you?

01:44:33.194 --> 01:44:35.355
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

01:44:35.463 --> 01:44:37.260
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.

01:44:41.136 --> 01:44:42.125
Let's move!

01:45:11.032 --> 01:45:12.021
You all right?

01:45:12.834 --> 01:45:13.801
Yeah.

01:45:24.179 --> 01:45:25.146
Search him.

01:45:25.246 --> 01:45:26.804
I don't carry a weapon,

01:45:29.818 --> 01:45:31.046
ordinarily.

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.747
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

01:45:41.763 --> 01:45:43.060
Pull the pilot.

01:45:44.666 --> 01:45:46.759
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

01:45:46.868 --> 01:45:48.028
Put your gun down!

01:45:48.136 --> 01:45:49.262
Easy. Easy.

01:45:59.714 --> 01:46:00.772
Sarah.

01:46:01.816 --> 01:46:03.443
Give me the gun.

01:46:04.152 --> 01:46:05.915
It's okay. Give me the gun.

01:46:15.263 --> 01:46:16.457
You okay?

01:46:16.631 --> 01:46:19.225
Put them up. Keep them up.

01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:20.892
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:24.564
Yeah, you got what you came for.

01:46:24.673 --> 01:46:26.937
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

01:46:27.042 --> 01:46:28.009
You do, huh?

01:46:28.143 --> 01:46:31.135
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

01:46:31.813 --> 01:46:34.805
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

01:46:34.916 --> 01:46:36.679
just as a preamble?

01:46:36.785 --> 01:46:38.650
You got any plans after this?

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.757
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

01:46:43.858 --> 01:46:46.053
Work? For you?

01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:49.927
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

01:46:50.031 --> 01:46:53.592
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

01:46:53.702 --> 01:46:55.761
And what side are you on?

01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:58.737
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.000
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

01:47:00.108 --> 01:47:02.406
There's only haves and have-nots.

01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:05.502
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

01:47:05.914 --> 01:47:09.111
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

01:47:09.217 --> 01:47:11.048
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

01:47:11.152 --> 01:47:12.141
so a pipeline could go through.

01:47:12.253 --> 01:47:13.845
One village!

01:47:13.955 --> 01:47:15.980
And it brought stability to the region.

01:47:16.091 --> 01:47:19.254
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.157
because their
grandmother's grandfather

01:47:21.262 --> 01:47:22.854
belonged to a different tribe.

01:47:23.865 --> 01:47:25.355
They like us down there, boy.

01:47:32.407 --> 01:47:34.500
This is a country

01:47:35.243 --> 01:47:37.438
where the Secretary of Defense

01:47:39.614 --> 01:47:41.206
can go on TV

01:47:41.583 --> 01:47:43.710
and tell the American public,

01:47:43.918 --> 01:47:47.547
oh, that "This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!"

01:47:48.356 --> 01:47:50.290
And nobody questions him,

01:47:50.391 --> 01:47:51.824
because they don't want to hear
the answer

01:47:51.926 --> 01:47:53.257
because it's a lie!

01:47:55.697 --> 01:47:59.929
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

01:48:00.335 --> 01:48:01.996
Now are you on the inside,

01:48:02.337 --> 01:48:03.634
or are you on the out?

01:48:10.712 --> 01:48:12.043
It's the FBI!

01:48:12.881 --> 01:48:14.473
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

01:48:17.218 --> 01:48:20.585
If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...

01:48:20.688 --> 01:48:22.349
I don't think so, Senator.

01:48:26.594 --> 01:48:28.528
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

01:48:28.963 --> 01:48:31.090
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

01:48:31.199 --> 01:48:35.033
This stuff's plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

01:48:35.136 --> 01:48:38.594
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

01:48:38.706 --> 01:48:41.698
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:43.334
I'm out, old man!

01:48:43.444 --> 01:48:46.242
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

01:48:46.347 --> 01:48:47.644
You happy?

01:48:51.953 --> 01:48:53.716
Where do you think you're going?

01:48:53.822 --> 01:48:55.255
Washington!

01:48:55.356 --> 01:48:59.793
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. senator in the back?

01:48:59.894 --> 01:49:01.452
Lord knows I want to.

01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:03.763
I didn't think so.

01:49:05.033 --> 01:49:06.227
Let him go.

01:49:07.268 --> 01:49:08.895
They've got your rifle.

01:49:10.505 --> 01:49:12.939
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

01:49:13.041 --> 01:49:14.702
Recovered at the site.

01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:24.712
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

01:49:25.186 --> 01:49:27.677
you're going to die by lethal injection,

01:49:27.789 --> 01:49:30.280
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

01:49:35.496 --> 01:49:36.622
I won.

01:49:37.665 --> 01:49:39.030
You lost.

01:49:39.834 --> 01:49:41.995
Get used to the idea, son.

01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:43.903
I'm not your son.

01:49:58.553 --> 01:50:00.817
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

01:50:00.922 --> 01:50:04.483
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI!
Don't shoot!

01:50:04.592 --> 01:50:06.753
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

01:50:07.362 --> 01:50:08.386
I said get down!

01:50:27.749 --> 01:50:30.377
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

01:50:30.485 --> 01:50:32.112
Thank you, sir.

01:50:33.588 --> 01:50:35.249
Thanks for bringing her.

01:50:40.795 --> 01:50:43.423
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

01:50:43.531 --> 01:50:45.829
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:52.198
This is Attorney General Russert.

01:50:53.207 --> 01:50:55.801
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:58.242
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

01:50:58.346 --> 01:51:00.507
I'm sure we can manage without him.

01:51:00.615 --> 01:51:02.844
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

01:51:03.918 --> 01:51:07.149
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.

01:51:07.255 --> 01:51:08.722
What the hell am I doing here?

01:51:08.957 --> 01:51:11.050
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

01:51:11.526 --> 01:51:12.925
Call the Joint Chief.

01:51:14.562 --> 01:51:15.859
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

01:51:15.964 --> 01:51:18.330
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

01:51:18.433 --> 01:51:20.901
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

01:51:21.002 --> 01:51:22.492
telling me to let you go.

01:51:22.603 --> 01:51:25.697
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

01:51:26.641 --> 01:51:28.108
and am, indeed, required by law,

01:51:28.242 --> 01:51:30.437
to tell them to fuck off.

01:51:30.545 --> 01:51:32.206
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

01:51:32.313 --> 01:51:34.247
so you sit there and be quiet.

01:51:37.885 --> 01:51:39.876
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

01:51:39.988 --> 01:51:41.114
Thank you.

01:51:43.324 --> 01:51:45.053
This is my weapon.

01:51:45.159 --> 01:51:47.491
No question about it, don't deny it.

01:51:47.595 --> 01:51:49.961
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

01:51:50.064 --> 01:51:51.031
We agree?

01:51:51.766 --> 01:51:53.290
It's been in the FBI's possession
ever since,

01:51:53.401 --> 01:51:54.800
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

01:51:54.902 --> 01:51:56.426
No. Absolutely not.

01:51:56.537 --> 01:51:58.664
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

01:51:58.773 --> 01:52:00.934
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

01:52:01.042 --> 01:52:03.943
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

01:52:04.045 --> 01:52:06.411
Right. Definitely my bullets.

01:52:07.548 --> 01:52:09.209
Definitely my gun.

01:52:09.317 --> 01:52:11.785
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

01:52:11.886 --> 01:52:13.410
Nope. No, I don't.

01:52:13.521 --> 01:52:16.046
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

01:52:16.157 --> 01:52:17.590
- Trust me?
- Yep.

01:52:17.692 --> 01:52:18.852
Really trust me?

01:52:19.227 --> 01:52:20.194
Yeah.

01:52:21.262 --> 01:52:22.456
With your life?

01:52:23.064 --> 01:52:24.463
- Yep.
- Good.

01:52:26.034 --> 01:52:28.400
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

01:52:28.503 --> 01:52:31.336
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

01:52:31.439 --> 01:52:32.929
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

01:52:33.041 --> 01:52:34.167
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

01:52:34.275 --> 01:52:35.799
is whether I'm crazy or not.

01:52:42.216 --> 01:52:43.979
I could keep doing this all day,

01:52:44.719 --> 01:52:46.311
with every weapon in my house.

01:52:46.821 --> 01:52:49.881
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

01:52:49.991 --> 01:52:52.016
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

01:52:52.493 --> 01:52:53.858
But the gun don't shoot.

01:52:54.262 --> 01:52:56.253
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

01:52:56.364 --> 01:52:58.127
but a week before, at a can of stew.

01:52:58.232 --> 01:53:01.463
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

01:53:01.569 --> 01:53:03.867
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

01:53:03.971 --> 01:53:05.734
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:08.400
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:10.836
Whatever.

01:53:11.612 --> 01:53:13.079
Who gives a shit?

01:53:14.415 --> 01:53:15.882
Nice presentation.

01:53:15.983 --> 01:53:17.780
But none of it sticks to me.

01:53:18.986 --> 01:53:22.183
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:23.552
Done.

01:53:23.658 --> 01:53:24.989
I'll be seeing you.

01:53:25.093 --> 01:53:28.290
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

01:53:28.396 --> 01:53:29.590
Yeah, in this country.

01:53:29.697 --> 01:53:32.325
Sir, you should take a look at these.

01:53:37.738 --> 01:53:43.199
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:46.007
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

01:53:46.114 --> 01:53:47.081
My God.

01:53:47.281 --> 01:53:48.475
Look around you.

01:53:49.050 --> 01:53:51.177
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

01:53:51.285 --> 01:53:52.843
That's all hearsay.

01:53:52.954 --> 01:53:55.582
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

01:53:55.690 --> 01:53:57.123
And I'm free to go.

01:53:57.758 --> 01:53:59.555
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:03.596
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

01:54:03.698 --> 01:54:05.825
Regardless of how I feel about this,

01:54:06.868 --> 01:54:08.358
these events occurred
in another country,

01:54:08.469 --> 01:54:09.766
outside of our laws.

01:54:09.871 --> 01:54:12.396
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

01:54:12.507 --> 01:54:14.532
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

01:54:15.409 --> 01:54:17.707
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

01:54:17.812 --> 01:54:20.474
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

01:54:20.581 --> 01:54:24.108
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

01:54:27.588 --> 01:54:29.215
I win.

01:54:29.323 --> 01:54:30.551
You lose.

01:54:31.292 --> 01:54:32.259
Again.

01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:36.187
This is ridiculous.

01:54:58.486 --> 01:55:02.047
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

01:55:02.757 --> 01:55:04.657
But this is the world we live in.

01:55:04.759 --> 01:55:07.694
And justice does not always prevail.

01:55:07.795 --> 01:55:08.762
It's not the Wild West,

01:55:08.863 --> 01:55:11.161
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:15.333
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

01:55:19.974 --> 01:55:22.504
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

01:55:26.647 --> 01:55:28.444
Unshackle the sergeant.

01:55:31.786 --> 01:55:34.016
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

01:55:34.121 --> 01:55:35.383
In the face.

01:55:36.791 --> 01:55:39.021
You heard that expression,

01:55:39.126 --> 01:55:41.424
"You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind"?

01:55:45.399 --> 01:55:48.630
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

01:55:49.737 --> 01:55:54.037
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

01:55:54.141 --> 01:55:57.542
"This is about evidence and the truth!"

01:55:57.645 --> 01:56:00.170
And then you just said to him,

01:56:00.281 --> 01:56:01.578
"Fuck you!"

01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:05.050
"Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G."

01:56:07.321 --> 01:56:08.618
"Fuck you!

01:56:10.391 --> 01:56:12.825
"The truth is what I say it is!"

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:22.232
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

01:56:22.336 --> 01:56:24.099
You're going to Ecuador.

01:56:27.575 --> 01:56:31.170
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

01:56:31.279 --> 01:56:34.840
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralize the problem, but...

01:56:35.116 --> 01:56:36.811
Well, they've requested you.

01:56:38.586 --> 01:56:39.951
It's solvable.

01:56:42.623 --> 01:56:43.817
They requested you...

01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.184
Swagger.

01:56:52.066 --> 01:56:53.124
Turn off the lights!

01:57:00.708 --> 01:57:01.732
Get my car.

01:57:01.909 --> 01:57:03.035
Get my car.

01:57:22.897 --> 01:57:23.864
Do something.

01:57:24.665 --> 01:57:25.893
Do something!

01:57:34.208 --> 01:57:35.334
Where is he?

01:57:48.022 --> 01:57:49.148
He's under the floor!

01:58:19.954 --> 01:58:21.546
You don't need to kill me.

01:58:22.890 --> 01:58:24.517
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

01:58:24.959 --> 01:58:25.926
It was them.

01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:31.493
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

01:58:33.701 --> 01:58:36.101
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

01:58:38.439 --> 01:58:41.840
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

01:58:41.942 --> 01:58:44.775
I am a United States senator!

01:58:44.979 --> 01:58:45.947
Exactly.
