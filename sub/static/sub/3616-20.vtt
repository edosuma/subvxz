WEBVTT

00:03.544 --> 00:06.112
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:06.212 --> 00:07.208
RUPTURED PLACENTA.
POSSIBLE PROLAPSED CORD.

00:07.218 --> 00:09.030
SHE'S FIVE CENTIMETERS DILATED.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.781
LET'S TELL O.R. TO GET SET UP
FOR A CRASH C-SECTION.

00:10.881 --> 00:12.949
NO, WAIT. I'M ONLY
TWO MONTHS PREGNANT.

00:13.049 --> 00:15.075
SHE'S FULL TERM.

00:15.175 --> 00:16.075
NO, YOU'RE WRONG!

00:16.175 --> 00:17.285
WHERE ARE MY SISTERS?
I NEED MY SISTERS.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.077
DID YOU CALL THEM?

00:20.177 --> 00:21.203
THERE WAS NO TIME.

00:21.303 --> 00:22.454
WE'RE LESS THAN A MINUTE
FROM SKIN TO BABY.

00:22.554 --> 00:23.870
SCALPEL.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.787
AND UTERINE INCISION.

00:25.887 --> 00:27.581
I NEED ANOTHER STRETCH.

00:27.681 --> 00:28.749
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

00:28.849 --> 00:30.542
I'M AFRAID
OF WHAT'S INSIDE ME.

00:30.642 --> 00:32.791
I CAN SEE THE BABY.

00:32.891 --> 00:34.876
OH, GOD, PLEASE
LET IT BE NORMAL.

00:34.976 --> 00:37.461
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
LET HIM BE NORMAL.

00:37.561 --> 00:39.963
OK, SHOULDERS
AND...HE IS OUT.

00:40.063 --> 00:43.339
[BABY CRYING]

00:43.439 --> 00:45.090
CUT THE CORD.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.383
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE YOUR NEW BOY?

00:46.483 --> 00:49.009
THERE YOU ARE.

00:49.109 --> 00:51.385
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.319
OH, HE IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.279
OK, HERE YOU GO.

00:59.281 --> 01:00.824
NO. THE SEER.

01:02.658 --> 01:04.808
DON'T LET HER TAKE MY BABY!

01:04.908 --> 01:06.518
DON'T LET HER TAKE MY BABY!

01:06.618 --> 01:08.728
DON'T LET HER TAKE MY BABY!

01:08.828 --> 01:10.787
HEY.

02:57.966 --> 03:01.619
SO HE ASKED ME OUT
AGAIN LAST NIGHT,

03:01.719 --> 03:02.952
BUT HE WAS SO QUIET
DURING DINNER THAT...

03:03.052 --> 03:06.372
UGH, I SWEAR I COULD HEAR
HIS STOMACH DIGESTING.

03:06.472 --> 03:08.955
I ALWAYS PREFERRED
QUIET MEN.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.624
THEY MAKE
GOOD LISTENERS.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.308
WHAT'S THAT, DEAR?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.225
Piper: HI, SWEETIE.
COME SIT, EAT.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.103
OH, NO. I CAN'T.
THAT SMELL.

03:20.812 --> 03:23.880
IT SMELLS GOOD.

03:23.980 --> 03:25.507
MORNING SICKNESS, LEO.

03:25.607 --> 03:26.923
MORNING, NOON, AND NIGHT.

03:27.023 --> 03:29.550
IT'S MORE LIKE
AROUND-THE-CLOCK SICKNESS. WELL, DID YOU AT LEAST
GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP?

03:29.650 --> 03:31.967
THE NIGHTMARE CAME BACK.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.511
Paige: WITH THE SEER?

03:33.611 --> 03:34.985
SHE WANTS MY BABY.
I KNOW IT.

03:36.069 --> 03:38.429
I'M AFRAID THAT
SHE'S GONNA SUMMON ME
TO HER AT ANY MOMENT.

03:38.529 --> 03:41.515
SHE COULD ONLY GET TO YOU
WHEN YOU CHOSE EVIL.

03:41.615 --> 03:43.949
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

03:44.617 --> 03:46.517
I SWEAR TO YOU,
THE SEER WILL NEVER LAY A FINGER ON YOUR BABY.

03:46.618 --> 03:48.434
YEAH. SHE'LL HAVE
TO GET THROUGH FIRST.

03:48.535 --> 03:50.603
THANKS, GUYS.

03:50.703 --> 03:52.894
ARE YOU OK?

03:52.994 --> 03:53.895
YEAH. YOU KNOW...

03:53.995 --> 03:55.895
PAIN COMES IN WAVES.

03:55.995 --> 03:57.896
HONEY, YOU LOST
YOUR HUSBAND.

03:57.996 --> 03:59.399
IT'S OK TO BE VERY UPSET.

03:59.499 --> 04:01.024
NO, I CAN'T.

04:01.124 --> 04:02.818
I HAVE TO STAY STRONG
FOR THE BABY.

04:02.918 --> 04:05.000
HE'S ALL
I HAVE LEFT OF COLE.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.487
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS.</i>

04:08.587 --> 04:10.696
THERE MIGHT BE SOME MAGICAL
PROTECTION AGAINST THE SEER.

04:10.796 --> 04:12.947
UH, MISSY PAIGE,
YOU NEED TO GO TO WORK.

04:13.047 --> 04:16.116
WELL, I'LL BE LATE.

04:16.216 --> 04:18.257
PHOEBE DOESN'T NEED TO BE
STRESSED WHILE SHE'S PREGNANT.

04:23.009 --> 04:26.095
PAIGE, WAIT.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.722
GO AHEAD,
SAY IT.

04:30.932 --> 04:33.708
SAY WHAT?

04:33.808 --> 04:35.584
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW
ON SOME LEVEL

04:35.684 --> 04:37.252
YOU'VE BEEN
DYING TO SAY TO ME.

04:37.352 --> 04:39.017
THERE'S NOTHING.

04:40.561 --> 04:41.796
COME ON. YOU KNEW
COLE WAS EVIL

04:41.896 --> 04:45.005
THE WHOLE TIME WHEN EVERYONE
THOUGHT YOU WERE CRAZY.

04:45.105 --> 04:47.006
AND THANKS TO YOU,
WE VANQUISHED THE SOURCE

04:47.106 --> 04:48.923
AND GAVE COLE PEACE.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.716
SO GO AHEAD, SAY IT.

04:50.817 --> 04:52.551
SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO."

04:52.651 --> 04:54.510
I WILL NOT.
THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.

04:54.610 --> 04:57.320
I WAS SO UNFAIR TO YOU
FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS
WHEN YOU WERE RIGHT,

04:58.403 --> 05:02.097
AND I JUST--I WANNA
CLEAR THE AIR RIGHT NOW.

05:02.197 --> 05:04.306
YOU'RE REALLY SWEET,
AND I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,

05:04.407 --> 05:07.408
BUT EVERYTHING
IS TOTALLY FINE.

05:14.035 --> 05:17.021
OH, WHOA.

05:17.121 --> 05:19.857
ANOTHER HOT FLASH?

05:19.958 --> 05:20.939
UH-HUH. IT'S WHEN
I MOVE TOO FAST.

05:21.039 --> 05:23.625
PHOEBE, THAT'S NOT REALLY
A TYPICAL PREGNANCY SYMPTOM,

05:23.876 --> 05:26.942
I DON'T THINK.

05:27.042 --> 05:28.194
MAYBE IT'S TIME WE GET
THAT BABY CHECKED OUT.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.361
I JUST HAVEN'T
HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE...

05:29.461 --> 05:32.071
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT?

05:32.171 --> 05:33.447
WELL, I HAVE ONE.
IT'S YOURS.

05:33.547 --> 05:36.615
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO FIND OUT ABOUT
THE FERTILITY TEST?

05:36.715 --> 05:39.074
YEAH, BUT, UH,
PHOEBE NEEDS THAT APPOINTMENT

05:39.174 --> 05:41.117
MORE THAN WE DO RIGHT NOW.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.660
HOW CAN I GO
TO THE DOCTOR

05:42.760 --> 05:43.951
WHEN I HAVE
A DEMONICALLY
CHALLENGED BABY?

05:44.051 --> 05:45.495
WHO KNOW WHAT EFFECTS

05:45.595 --> 05:46.829
THE SEER'S TONICS
HAD ON THE LITTLE GUY?

05:46.929 --> 05:48.830
THIS IS MY POINT EXACTLY.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.372
AND IF IT WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER, I'LL GO WITH YOU

05:50.472 --> 05:52.373
SO I CAN PUT THE FREEZE ON
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.

05:52.473 --> 05:55.041
YOU'RE GOING.

05:55.141 --> 05:56.834
INTO THE STIRRUPS FOR YOU.

05:56.935 --> 05:58.851
UGH.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.421
DANE, SON OF GOATH,

06:04.521 --> 06:07.063
MAY THE WORLD'S EVIL FLOW
THROUGH YOUR SOUL TONIGHT

06:07.648 --> 06:11.191
AND GRANT YOU
ETERNAL DARKNESS.

06:16.027 --> 06:19.762
ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE
THE POWER AND POSITION

06:19.862 --> 06:22.180
OF THE SOURCE BEFORE THESE
LEADERS OF THE UNDERWORLD?

06:22.281 --> 06:25.073
I AM.

06:27.073 --> 06:30.310
STOP THE CORONATION!

06:30.410 --> 06:32.769
SEER!

06:32.869 --> 06:33.977
I DIDN'T SEE
YOUR NAME ON
THE GUEST LIST.

06:34.077 --> 06:36.563
ALWAYS A RARE PRIVILEGE,

06:36.663 --> 06:38.022
BUT NOT THE BEST TIMING.

06:38.122 --> 06:39.815
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

06:39.915 --> 06:40.980
A VISION.

06:41.080 --> 06:41.981
I SAW THE SOURCE'S
TRUE HEIR

06:42.081 --> 06:44.982
LEADING
THE UNDERWORLD.

06:45.082 --> 06:46.776
IF THAT WAS YOUR VISION,
YOU NEED GLASSES.

06:46.876 --> 06:49.985
THE SOURCE'S HEIR LIVES
IN THE BELLY OF A WITCH.

06:50.085 --> 06:53.112
HE'S RIGHT.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.322
THE UNDERWORLD
CANNOT WAIT MONTHS

06:54.422 --> 06:55.988
FOR A BABY TO BE BORN,
THEN YEARS FOR IT TO GROW UP.

06:56.088 --> 06:59.241
IT NEEDS LEADERSHIP NOW.

06:59.341 --> 07:01.117
IN MY VISION, I SAW
THE SOURCE'S SON

07:01.217 --> 07:03.160
TAKING
IMMEDIATE POWER.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.993
[LAUGHS]

07:05.094 --> 07:06.912
HOW CAN AN UNBORN CHILD
LEAD THE UNDERWORLD?

07:07.013 --> 07:09.555
WITH MY HELP, HE CAN.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.057
WHAT DO YOU NEED
FROM THIS COUNCIL?

07:14.432 --> 07:16.600
A CHANCE TO PROVE
MY VISION TRUE.

07:17.059 --> 07:20.418
SHE HAS NO RIGHT
TO ASK THIS.

07:20.518 --> 07:23.128
I WAS CHOSEN
BY THESE LEADERS!

07:23.228 --> 07:25.463
BUT YOU HAVE NO DIRECT
LINEAGE TO THE SOURCE

07:25.563 --> 07:27.480
BY BLOOD OR BY MAGIC.

07:29.148 --> 07:32.258
YOU HAVE UNTIL TONIGHT

07:32.358 --> 07:33.592
TO BRING US
THE SOURCE'S HEIR

07:33.692 --> 07:35.401
OR THE THRONE
BELONGS TO DANE.

07:37.694 --> 07:41.346
YOUR HORMONE LEVELS
ARE UNUSUALLY HIGH

07:41.446 --> 07:43.430
FOR A MOTHER
IN HER EIGHTH WEEK.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.891
HAVE YOU SEEN A DOCTOR

07:45.991 --> 07:47.224
SINCE YOU FOUND OUT
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

07:47.324 --> 07:48.450
I WAS UNDER
THE CARE OF A SEER.

07:49.116 --> 07:52.268
[LAUGHS]

07:52.368 --> 07:53.393
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A NEW-AGE DOCTOR.

07:53.493 --> 07:56.119
WELL, YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE
SEEN A DOCTOR BEFORE TODAY.

07:56.454 --> 07:59.731
A REAL DOCTOR.

07:59.831 --> 08:00.981
DO YOU THINK THAT
THERE COULD POSSIBLY

08:01.081 --> 08:02.774
BE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MY BABY?

08:02.874 --> 08:04.650
WELL, LET'S JUST
TAKE A PEEK, SHALL WE?

08:04.750 --> 08:05.901
WHY DON'T YOU LIE BACK,

08:06.001 --> 08:07.652
AND I'M GOING
TO DO AN ULTRASOUND.

08:07.752 --> 08:10.026
[SIGHS]

08:10.126 --> 08:11.295
NOW THIS GEL'S
A LITTLE BIT COLD.

08:14.212 --> 08:14.546
UHH!

08:17.381 --> 08:18.966
UHH.

08:19.924 --> 08:20.992
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

08:21.092 --> 08:22.242
HOT FLASH.

08:22.342 --> 08:24.034
A VERY, VERY
HOT, HOT, HOT FLASH.

08:24.134 --> 08:27.035
NOT A GOOD SIGN.

08:27.135 --> 08:28.788
WELL, UH, YEAH.

08:28.888 --> 08:30.079
SHE'S BEEN GETTING
THOSE A LOT LATELY.

08:30.179 --> 08:31.872
NO, NOT LIKE THIS ONE!

08:31.972 --> 08:33.414
I MEAN, IT FELT LIKE
MY HEAD WAS ON FIRE...

08:33.514 --> 08:36.667
FOR REAL.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.958
LET'S--LET'S
JUST HAVE A LOOK, OK?

08:38.058 --> 08:40.001
ALL RIGHT.

08:40.101 --> 08:41.602
WELL, THERE. SEE?

08:42.519 --> 08:44.062
OOH.

08:44.186 --> 08:45.145
THERE'S THE LITTLE--

08:47.688 --> 08:48.981
UHH!

08:50.066 --> 08:53.008
HUH...HI...

08:53.108 --> 08:54.592
HERE YOU GO.

08:54.692 --> 08:56.050
WHAT...

08:56.150 --> 08:57.093
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:57.193 --> 08:58.970
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

08:59.070 --> 09:01.428
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:01.528 --> 09:03.221
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

09:03.321 --> 09:04.931
MY HEAD WAS ON FIRE
LIKE A TIKI TORCH
A FEW SECONDS AGO.

09:05.031 --> 09:07.766
DO NOT CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

09:07.866 --> 09:09.194
DID YOUR BABY
JUST ELECTROCUTE
THE NICE DOCTOR MAN?

09:09.204 --> 09:12.351
YEAH.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.269
I THINK SO, BUT HE WAS
JUST PROTECTING HIMSELF,

09:14.369 --> 09:16.895
'CAUSE THAT GEL
WAS REALLY COLD.

09:16.995 --> 09:18.271
PROTECTING HIMSELF?

09:18.371 --> 09:19.939
UNBORN BABIES DON'T
PERFORM MAGIC TRICKS

09:20.039 --> 09:22.106
IN THE FIRST
TRIMESTER, PHOEBE.

09:22.206 --> 09:23.816
WHAT IS GOING ON?

09:23.916 --> 09:25.064
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT DON'T PANIC, OK?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.942
WE'LL WRAP UP HERE,
AND WE'LL GO HOME
AND PANIC.

09:27.043 --> 09:29.377
IT SAYS HERE THE SEER
HAS SERVED MULTIPLE SOURCES.

09:30.752 --> 09:34.069
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S BEEN AROUND
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

09:34.169 --> 09:36.446
Piper: HEY.

09:36.546 --> 09:37.447
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:37.547 --> 09:39.072
MY BABY DID MAGIC.

09:39.172 --> 09:40.658
AND ALMOST
KILLED MY DOCTOR.

09:40.758 --> 09:43.074
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

09:43.174 --> 09:44.367
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

09:44.467 --> 09:46.075
WHEN YOU BREED
WITH THE SOURCE
OF ALL EVIL.

09:46.175 --> 09:48.076
OK, CAN WE
NOT SAY "BREED"?

09:48.176 --> 09:50.413
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT A HORSE.

09:50.513 --> 09:52.078
AND COLE
WASN'T ALL EVIL,

09:52.178 --> 09:53.455
HE WAS PART GOOD,
AND I'M ALL GOOD,

09:53.555 --> 09:55.331
SO THIS BABY HAS
A LOT OF GOOD IN HIM.

09:55.431 --> 09:58.081
WHAT IF THERE'S NOT?

09:58.182 --> 09:59.500
THEN THERE WILL BE.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.919
MY LOVE WAS ABLE
TO SAVE COLE.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.085
IT'LL SAVE
OUR SON, TOO.

10:05.185 --> 10:06.604
LET'S HOPE SO.

10:08.106 --> 10:09.380
NO, WE'LL MAKE IT SO.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.381
OK?

10:11.481 --> 10:12.882
SO WHAT DID YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT THE SEER?

10:12.982 --> 10:14.466
WELL, SHE'S IMMUNE
TO SPELLS AND CHARMS,

10:14.566 --> 10:16.301
BUT THE BOOK
DOES CLASSIFY HER
AS AN UPPER-LEVEL DEMON.

10:16.401 --> 10:19.218
SO WE CAN MAKE
A VANQUISHING POTION.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.012
MM-MMM.

10:21.112 --> 10:22.013
NOT WITHOUT
A TISSUE SAMPLE.

10:22.113 --> 10:23.680
ACTUALLY...

10:23.780 --> 10:25.096
THE SEER
MIXED HER OWN BLOOD

10:25.196 --> 10:27.599
INTO MY
PRENATAL TONIC.

10:27.699 --> 10:29.097
Piper: NASTY.

10:29.197 --> 10:30.099
YEAH.

10:30.199 --> 10:31.141
AND COLE KEPT
SOME EXTRA BOTTLES

10:31.242 --> 10:32.642
IN THE SAFE
AT THE PENTHOUSE.

10:32.742 --> 10:33.977
YOU THINK YOU'RE READY
TO GO TO THE PENTHOUSE?

10:34.077 --> 10:36.102
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE,
YOU KNOW, SINCE--

10:36.202 --> 10:38.520
SINCE HE DIED.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.730
I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER BE READY,

10:40.830 --> 10:43.105
BUT I CAN'T KEEP
BORROWING YOUR CLOTHES.

10:43.205 --> 10:44.941
[LAUGHS]

10:45.041 --> 10:46.106
Piper:
OK, LET'S GO.

10:46.206 --> 10:47.358
WAIT, DON'T
YOU HAVE TO WORK?

10:47.458 --> 10:49.443
AH, I'LL TAKE
THE AFTERNOON OFF.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.193
WHO NEEDS
VACATION TIME?

10:51.293 --> 10:53.029
PAIGE, YOU CAN'T KEEP--

10:53.129 --> 10:54.029
YES, I CAN.

10:54.129 --> 10:55.529
THANK YOU.

10:55.629 --> 10:57.131
BITCH!

10:58.089 --> 10:59.132
OW!

11:02.591 --> 11:05.826
[GASPS]

11:05.926 --> 11:07.635
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT FOR?

11:09.261 --> 11:11.162
UH...

11:11.262 --> 11:12.163
I DON'T KNOW.

11:12.263 --> 11:14.121
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM.

11:14.221 --> 11:15.664
OK.

11:15.764 --> 11:16.999
WHY DID YOUR MOMMY PUSH
PAIGE OUT THE WINDOW?

11:17.099 --> 11:19.374
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:19.474 --> 11:20.876
IT'S JUST...

11:20.976 --> 11:22.263
HE TOOK OVER
FOR A SPLIT SECOND.
I HAD NO CONTROL.

11:22.273 --> 11:24.669
BUT WHY ME?

11:24.769 --> 11:26.295
I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST THAT
LITTLE FU--

11:26.395 --> 11:28.005
FETUS.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.129
I'M SURE HE'S SORRY.

11:30.229 --> 11:32.298
AREN'T YOU SORRY?

11:32.398 --> 11:35.091
KIDS AT THIS AGE,

11:35.191 --> 11:36.425
THEY DON'T KNOW
ANY BETTER, YOU KNOW?

11:36.525 --> 11:38.926
OK, I THINK I BETTER
GO CHECK WITH THE ELDERS

11:39.026 --> 11:40.344
TO SEE WHAT THEY KNOW
ABOUT THIS BABY.

11:40.444 --> 11:42.235
WHATEVER IT IS,

11:43.236 --> 11:44.387
I'M SURE IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE SEER.

11:44.487 --> 11:46.488
LET'S GO
GET THAT BLOOD.

11:48.322 --> 11:51.850
WHAT WAS
THAT OUT THERE?

11:51.950 --> 11:53.601
FLYING PRACTICE?

11:53.701 --> 11:54.894
A BABY SHOVED ME
OUT THE WINDOW.

11:54.994 --> 11:56.268
Piper: UHH.

11:56.368 --> 11:57.645
WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND.
I LEFT 4 MESSAGES HERE.

11:57.745 --> 11:59.479
HAS ANYBODY IN
THIS HOUSE LEARNED THE
MAGIC OF A TELEPHONE?

11:59.579 --> 12:02.105
DARRYL, IT'S BEEN
A VERY ROUGH WEEK.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.774
Darryl:
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

12:04.874 --> 12:06.315
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT PART OF THE DAY
YOU ASK ME.

12:06.415 --> 12:09.149
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A LOT TO DEAL WITH ALREADY,

12:09.249 --> 12:12.569
BUT THERE'S SOME BUSINESS
I DON'T THINK CAN BE
PUT OFF ANY LONGER.

12:12.669 --> 12:15.195
I'M SURE
IT'S PRESSING,

12:15.295 --> 12:16.780
BUT NOT AS PRESSING
AS THE DEMON
THAT'S AFTER PHOEBE.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.073
DON'T COUNT ON IT.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.448
COLE WORKED AT
A HIGH-PROFILE LAW FIRM.

12:20.548 --> 12:22.449
RIGHT NOW, YOU THREE
ARE THE ONLY ONES
WHO KNOW HE'S DEAD.

12:22.549 --> 12:25.367
CAN THIS WAIT?
WE REALLY NEED TO
GET TO THE PENTHOUSE.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.552
GOOD, 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHERE I NEED YOU
TO HANDLE THIS BUSINESS.

12:33.221 --> 12:36.873
IT HAS TO LOOK LIKE
COLE LEFT IN A HURRY.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.999
THAT MEANS PACKING UP
ALL OF HIS STUFF

12:39.099 --> 12:40.892
AND PERSONAL
BELONGINGS.

12:43.602 --> 12:46.753
YOU OK?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.169
YEAH, I'M FINE.

12:48.269 --> 12:51.171
I'M SORRY, SO WHY DO YOU
WANT ME TO PACK UP HIS STUFF?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.171
I, UH, MADE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH YOU AT
MISSING PERSONS TODAY.

12:53.272 --> 12:57.174
WAIT. YOU WANT PHOEBE
TO REPORT COLE AS MISSING?

12:57.274 --> 12:59.927
SHE HAS TO. OTHERWISE,
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL

13:00.027 --> 13:01.844
AND SHE'LL BECOME
THE PRIME SUSPECT
IN HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

13:01.944 --> 13:03.804
SO YOU WANT ME
TO PACK UP HIS STUFF

13:03.904 --> 13:06.178
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
HE LEFT ME?

13:06.278 --> 13:07.597
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:07.697 --> 13:09.275
WE CANNOT GIVE
THE POLICE ANY REASON
TO SUSPECT FOUL PLAY.

13:09.285 --> 13:11.908
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY,
YOU THREE DID KILL HIM.

13:15.659 --> 13:18.937
WHAT IS THAT?

13:19.037 --> 13:20.078
WELL, THAT'S WHERE
WE--YOU KNOW.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.872
THIS PLACE LOOKS
LIKE A CRIME SCENE.

13:25.288 --> 13:28.441
IS THERE
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.609
LET THE OBJECT OF OBJECTION
BECOME BUT A DREAM,

13:30.709 --> 13:34.293
AS I CAUSE
THE SEEN TO BE UNSEEN.

13:41.296 --> 13:44.199
THANKS.

13:44.299 --> 13:46.009
I JUST WISH I COULD MAKE
THE REST OF YOUR PAIN

13:47.634 --> 13:49.535
GO AWAY THAT EASILY.

13:49.635 --> 13:51.327
SO DO I.

13:51.427 --> 13:54.122
YOU MURDERING WITCH!

13:54.222 --> 13:55.747
OHH!

13:55.847 --> 13:57.081
PHOEB!

13:57.181 --> 13:59.205
THE BABY MADE ME DO IT.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.374
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOW WE SPLIT UP.

14:00.474 --> 14:02.207
YOU TWO, GO PACK,

14:02.307 --> 14:04.626
WE'LL FIND
THE SEER'S TONIC.

14:04.726 --> 14:06.210
OK, WHERE IS THIS BABY

14:06.310 --> 14:08.210
THAT EVERYBODY
KEEPS TALKING ABOUT?

14:08.310 --> 14:10.063
IS IT AN INVISIBLE BABY?
AM I GOING TO STEP ON IT?

14:14.065 --> 14:17.508
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S WORRIED

14:17.608 --> 14:19.217
ABOUT THAT <i>THING
</i> GROWING INSIDE OF HER?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.510
NO, BUT RIGHT NOW,

14:21.610 --> 14:24.386
THE SEER IS
OUR FIRST PRIORITY.

14:24.486 --> 14:27.320
I THINK SHE SAID
IT'S BEHIND THIS PAINTING
OVER HERE.

14:33.658 --> 14:36.977
OK, SO NOW WHAT?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.394
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THE COMBINATION.

14:38.494 --> 14:39.936
WE DON'T NEED IT.

14:40.036 --> 14:41.537
SAFE DOOR!

14:42.871 --> 14:45.897
UHH.

14:45.997 --> 14:47.398
IF FINANCIAL DISASTER
EVER STRIKES,

14:47.498 --> 14:49.231
YOU'LL FIND
I COME IN HANDY.

14:49.331 --> 14:51.775
UHH.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.126
UH, THERE'S,
UH, NOTHING IN HERE.

14:53.334 --> 14:56.653
NO TONIC?
NO.

14:56.753 --> 14:58.336
BUT THERE'S THIS.

15:00.297 --> 15:02.298
IT'S COLE'S HANDWRITING.

15:03.632 --> 15:04.949
COLE THE HUMAN
OR COLE THE SOURCE?

15:05.049 --> 15:06.616
I DON'T KNOW.

15:06.716 --> 15:07.617
THAT'S FOR PHOEBE
TO FIND OUT.

15:07.717 --> 15:09.969
COLE GAVE ME THIS THE DAY
HE FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.972
LOOK, I'LL START PACKING
HIS STUFF UP, OK?

15:16.222 --> 15:19.890
AND YOU PULL YOUR
OWN THINGS TOGETHER.

15:28.186 --> 15:31.253
PIPER! PAIGE!

15:31.353 --> 15:33.022
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

15:34.857 --> 15:37.256
GET AWAY FROM ME!
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM!

15:37.356 --> 15:39.550
I ONLY WANT WHAT'S MINE!

15:39.650 --> 15:42.218
UHH.

15:42.318 --> 15:43.359
I'M LOSING HER!

15:45.820 --> 15:49.097
LET GO OF ME!

15:49.197 --> 15:50.263
AAH!

15:50.364 --> 15:51.347
AAH!
AAH!

15:51.447 --> 15:52.532
[PANTING]

15:59.786 --> 16:00.745
HERE'S
YOUR TISSUE SAMPLE.

16:09.332 --> 16:12.900
OK, I'M GOING
TO BRING THIS TO PHOEBE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.776
YOU STAY HERE.

16:14.876 --> 16:16.152
I DON'T WANT YOU
PROVOKING HER BABY
ANYMORE.

16:16.252 --> 16:18.777
PROVOKING HIM?
LIKE IT'S MY FAULT?

16:18.877 --> 16:20.962
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

16:25.508 --> 16:28.782
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:28.882 --> 16:29.867
SHH!

16:29.967 --> 16:30.867
I'M PLAYING MOZART
FOR THE BABY

16:30.967 --> 16:32.784
TO BRING OUT
HIS PEACEFUL NATURE.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.885
STUDIES SHOW THAT BABIES
CAN HEAR AND REMEMBER
SONGS FROM THE WOMB.

16:35.262 --> 16:38.664
MMM. THAT'S LOVELY.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.581
HOW ABOUT
YOU EAT SOMETHING

16:40.681 --> 16:41.999
SINCE YOU HAVEN'T HAD
ANYTHING TO EAT ALL DAY?

16:42.099 --> 16:44.625
I'VE BEEN NAUSEOUS ALL DAY.

16:44.725 --> 16:45.751
YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE FRESH ALL DAY.

16:45.851 --> 16:46.793
[SIGHS]

16:46.893 --> 16:49.793
I'M THINKING ABOUT
TRYING ACUPUNCTURE.

16:49.893 --> 16:51.212
I HEAR THAT HELPS.

16:51.312 --> 16:52.795
PHOEBE, DON'T!

16:52.895 --> 16:54.548
UGH, UGH.

16:54.648 --> 16:56.465
I'M GOING TO PUKE.

16:56.565 --> 16:58.357
MAYBE YOUR BABY
WOULD PREFER
TO LISTEN TO OZZY.

17:00.899 --> 17:02.610
THE ELDERS BELIEVE
THE SEER'S MAKING

17:04.569 --> 17:06.051
A SUDDEN PLAY
FOR THE SOURCE'S THRONE,

17:06.152 --> 17:07.801
BUT SHE NEEDS
PHOEBE'S BABY TO DO IT.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.305
THE SEER WANTS
TO BE THE SOURCE?

17:09.405 --> 17:11.556
WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY
HAVE TO DO WITH MY BABY?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.806
HE'S NOT DUE
FOR ANOTHER 7 MONTHS.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.641
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER,

17:15.741 --> 17:16.902
BECAUSE NEXT TIME WE
WILL BE READY FOR HER.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.768
NEXT TIME?

17:18.867 --> 17:20.352
YES, THE SEER
TRIED TO STEAL PHOEBE
FROM THE PENTHOUSE.

17:20.452 --> 17:22.810
HOW'S THAT POTION
COMING?

17:22.910 --> 17:25.604
IT'S DONE. IT JUST NEEDS
TO COOL A LITTLE BIT.

17:25.704 --> 17:27.497
AAH!

17:30.833 --> 17:34.359
THAT BABY NEEDS
A SERIOUS TIME-OUT.

17:34.459 --> 17:36.752
Piper: GO, GO,
GO INTO THE KITCHEN.

17:37.961 --> 17:41.447
SO MUCH FOR
THE VANQUISHING POTION.

17:41.547 --> 17:43.156
HOW COME YOUR BABY
ONLY ATTACKS ME?

17:43.256 --> 17:45.240
I DON'T KNOW, PAIGE,
HE MUST RESENT YOU.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.366
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER
REALLY LIKED HIS FATHER.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.367
WITH GOOD REASON.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.824
HEY, MAYBE
YOU RESENT ME,

17:50.925 --> 17:51.956
AND THE BABY'S
JUST MODELING AFTER MOM.

17:52.056 --> 17:53.994
PAIGE,
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

17:54.094 --> 17:55.370
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!

17:55.470 --> 17:56.662
THE TWO OF YOU WILL NOT
ADDRESS EACH OTHER,

17:56.763 --> 17:58.263
YOU WILL NOT SET FOOT
INTO THE SAME ROOM
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.790
YOU GOT IT?!

18:01.890 --> 18:03.207
YOU, YOU GOT
ENOUGH EAR LEFT TO MAKE

18:03.307 --> 18:04.832
ANOTHER BATCH
OF THAT POTION?

18:04.932 --> 18:06.250
YES.

18:06.350 --> 18:07.335
THEN DO IT. YOU...

18:07.435 --> 18:09.085
YOU'RE GOING TO
HIT THE <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS,</i>

18:09.185 --> 18:10.795
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO CONTROL CHUCKY THERE.

18:10.895 --> 18:13.837
I CAN'T. I TOLD MORRIS
I'D MEET HIM AT MISSING
PERSONS IN HALF AN HOUR.

18:13.937 --> 18:17.715
I WOULD STRONGLY
ADVISE AGAINST THAT.

18:17.815 --> 18:19.674
YOUR BABY...

18:19.774 --> 18:20.935
IS FINE, JUST AS LONG
HE DOESN'T FEEL THREATENED

18:20.945 --> 18:23.176
AND DOESN'T MEET ANYONE
WITH UNRESOLVED ISSUES
WITH HIS FATHER!

18:23.276 --> 18:26.636
Paige: I HEARD THAT.

18:26.736 --> 18:29.220
PHOEBE,
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

18:29.320 --> 18:30.845
HOW CAN YOU RISK GOING
OUT IN PUBLIC WITH--

18:30.945 --> 18:33.181
IN YOUR CONDITION?

18:33.281 --> 18:34.724
BECAUSE IF I DON'T
REPORT COLE MISSING,
SOMEONE WILL,

18:34.824 --> 18:37.224
AND THE POLICE WILL
BE KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.769
BESIDES, MORRIS
PUT HIMSELF ON THE LINE.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.561
I CAN'T LET HIM DOWN.

18:42.661 --> 18:44.328
ALL RIGHT, BUT
LEO IS GOING WITH YOU
IN CASE OF ANY TROUBLE.

18:45.996 --> 18:47.581
AND I WILL HIT THE BOOK
AND FIGURE OUT

18:49.915 --> 18:51.833
HOW TO DEAL
WITH DEMONIC FETUSES.

19:09.508 --> 19:12.967
I HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU.

19:14.968 --> 19:18.471
NOBODY COMES DOWN
TO THE SOURCE'S DUNGEON,

19:18.638 --> 19:22.432
UNLESS THEY ARE DEAD,
DAMNED, OR DESPERATE.

19:23.849 --> 19:26.875
WHICH ARE YOU?

19:26.975 --> 19:28.768
DESPERATE.
I NEED YOUR POWER.

19:28.975 --> 19:32.128
I HAVE A POWER?

19:32.228 --> 19:34.396
YES, I ALMOST FORGOT.

19:35.771 --> 19:38.840
I HAVEN'T USED IT
IN CENTURIES.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.524
I HAVE BEEN SENTENCED
TO SPEND ETERNITY
ALONE IN THIS CAGE.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.135
IT'S A FINE CAGE.

19:47.235 --> 19:51.029
THE SOURCE HAD IT FORGED
FROM UNBREAKABLE MAGIC.

19:51.279 --> 19:54.723
NOTHING CAN ESCAPE IT.

19:54.823 --> 19:56.557
YES, I KNOW.

19:56.657 --> 19:57.890
IT WAS SOME
OF MY BEST WORK.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.559
THAT'S RIGHT.
I BUILT YOUR PRISON.

19:59.659 --> 20:02.477
AND MY MAGIC ALONE
HAS THE POWER TO FREE YOU.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.813
THE SOURCE
WOULD NEVER ALLOW IT.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.772
THE SOURCE ID DEAD.

20:07.872 --> 20:08.979
I CAN GIVE YOU FREEDOM
AND A CHANCE

20:09.080 --> 20:11.897
TO EARN FAVOR
WITH THE NEW SOURCE

20:11.997 --> 20:14.066
IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR HELP.

20:14.166 --> 20:16.567
WHAT KIND OF HELP?

20:16.667 --> 20:18.210
I NEED YOU TO DO
WHAT EVERY DEMON
BEFORE YOU

20:20.001 --> 20:23.363
HAS FAILED TO DO,
EVEN ME--

20:23.463 --> 20:25.239
CAPTURE AND CONTAIN
A CHARMED ONE.

20:25.339 --> 20:28.240
A CHARMED WHAT?

20:28.340 --> 20:29.907
A POWERFUL WITCH.

20:30.007 --> 20:31.826
I NEED YOU TO BRING HER
DOWN TO THE UNDERWORLD.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.243
IT IS THE ONLY WAY
THAT MY MAGIC CAN WORK.

20:34.343 --> 20:36.453
THAT SHOULDN'T
BE HARD FOR YOU,

20:36.553 --> 20:38.995
A DEMON WHO HAS
SWALLOWED WORLDS.

20:39.095 --> 20:41.912
INTERESTED?

20:42.012 --> 20:43.097
GET ME OUT.

20:44.974 --> 20:47.934
REMEMBER, MY MAGIC
PUT YOU IN THIS CAGE.

20:48.434 --> 20:52.061
BETRAY ME,
AND YOU'LL GO RIGHT BACK.

20:55.980 --> 20:59.172
PLEASE BE GOOD,
AND I PROMISE

20:59.272 --> 21:01.106
I'LL EAT A HUGE
TRI-TIP TONIGHT.

21:01.942 --> 21:04.359
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET
INSPECTOR MILES.

21:05.568 --> 21:06.925
HE'S TRAINED
TO SPOT A LIAR,

21:07.025 --> 21:08.736
SO JUST ANSWER HIS
QUESTIONS AS HONESTLY
AS YOU CAN, OK?

21:20.492 --> 21:24.686
MORRIS TELLS ME
THAT YOU THINK YOUR HUSBAND
MIGHT HAVE LEFT TOWN.

21:24.786 --> 21:27.813
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.938
LAST WEDNESDAY,
WE...

21:30.038 --> 21:31.815
HAD A HUGE...

21:31.915 --> 21:33.732
BATTLE,
AND HE JUST
NEVER CAME BACK.

21:33.832 --> 21:36.776
HMM. DID HE
LEAVE ANYTHING?

21:36.876 --> 21:38.109
UH, NOTHING.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.402
I CHECKED
THE PENTHOUSE MYSELF.

21:39.502 --> 21:40.943
CLOTHING, PERSONAL
BELONGINGS...GONE.

21:41.043 --> 21:43.779
WHAT WAS THE FIGHT ABOUT?

21:43.879 --> 21:44.945
MY SISTERS.

21:45.045 --> 21:45.946
I HAVE 2 SISTERS,

21:46.046 --> 21:47.406
AND THEY DIDN'T APPROVE
OF ME MARRYING COLE.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.198
WHY NOT?

21:49.298 --> 21:50.283
THEY'RE
JUST DIFFERENT.

21:50.383 --> 21:51.867
OIL AND WATER,
YOU KNOW?

21:51.967 --> 21:53.701
FIRE AND ICE,
HEAVEN AND--

21:53.801 --> 21:54.950
HELL?

21:55.050 --> 21:55.950
BINGO.

21:56.050 --> 21:57.970
SO YOU'D SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND
HAS A DARK SIDE, THEN?

21:59.052 --> 22:01.954
YES.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.597
HAS HE EVER HURT YOU?

22:04.306 --> 22:05.723
MILES!

22:07.599 --> 22:08.684
YOU--YOU OK?

22:09.768 --> 22:11.042
HERE, LET ME HELP.

22:11.142 --> 22:12.836
YOU STOP THAT
RIGHT NOW!

22:12.936 --> 22:15.420
UM, INSPECTOR,
I KNOW IT DOESN'T SEEM

22:15.521 --> 22:17.962
LIKE MY HUSBAND'S
A GREAT GUY,
BUT I WOULD ADVISE YOU

22:18.062 --> 22:20.214
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING
NEGATIVE ABOUT HIM
RIGHT NOW.

22:20.314 --> 22:22.340
LISTEN, MA'AM, I GOT
TO CALL 'EM AS I SEE 'EM.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.425
YOU TURN UP PREGNANT,
AND HE TAKES OFF.

22:24.525 --> 22:27.066
YOUR HUSBAND FITS
THE CLASSIC PROFILE
OF A DEADBEAT DAD.

22:28.777 --> 22:31.068
[WHISPERING]
Make it go out!

22:32.237 --> 22:33.363
I can't make it go out!

22:39.533 --> 22:42.975
PHOEBE--I MEAN, FIRE!

22:43.075 --> 22:44.226
MOVE AWAY.

22:44.326 --> 22:46.019
MOVE AWAY.
MOVE AWAY. MOVE AWAY.

22:46.119 --> 22:47.870
[WHISPERING]
Why are you
doing this to me?

22:49.078 --> 22:50.271
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

22:50.371 --> 22:51.564
IT'S JUST THAT
THE BABY DOESN'T LIKE IT

22:51.664 --> 22:52.648
WHEN ANYBODY
TALKS BAD ABOUT COLE.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.040
OW!

22:55.624 --> 22:56.942
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:57.042 --> 22:57.982
MY STOMACH.

22:58.082 --> 23:00.026
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S
TEAR--TEARING.

23:00.126 --> 23:02.985
COME ON, LET'S
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

23:03.085 --> 23:04.085
UHH.

23:04.754 --> 23:05.086
YEAH, I'M OK.

23:08.088 --> 23:10.491
YEAH, I'M SURE.

23:10.591 --> 23:12.466
UM, I'LL CALL BACK
LATER TO SCHEDULE
THAT APPOINTMENT.

23:14.091 --> 23:17.343
OK, THANKS.

23:27.975 --> 23:31.167
YOU ARE JUST IN TIME.

23:31.267 --> 23:33.043
ONE BOTTLE OF
SEER VANQUISHING POTION.

23:33.143 --> 23:35.378
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ANYTHING IN THE BOOK

23:35.478 --> 23:36.879
ABOUT HOW TO CONTROL
DEMON SPAWN?

23:36.979 --> 23:38.505
UH, I THOUGHT ABOUT
BINDING HIS POWERS,

23:38.605 --> 23:41.004
BUT, UH, THEN THAT WOULD
LEAVE PHOEBE WITHOUT HERS.

23:41.104 --> 23:44.299
YEAH, WELL,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP
THAT OPTION OPEN.

23:44.399 --> 23:46.007
THERE'S SOMETHING
SERIOUSLY WRONG
WITH THAT BABY.

23:46.107 --> 23:48.969
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:49.069 --> 23:51.820
HE'S PART OF US.
PART OF OUR FAMILY.

23:52.695 --> 23:54.362
AND WHO KNOWS,

23:56.072 --> 23:57.197
HE MAY BE THE ONLY BABY
IN THE HALLIWELL FAMILY.

23:59.490 --> 24:00.240
OK.

24:02.659 --> 24:04.451
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SPILL.

24:05.117 --> 24:06.661
THAT WAS DR. HARRIS
ON THE PHONE.

24:08.954 --> 24:12.914
I GOT THE, UH, RESULTS
FROM MY FERTILITY TEST.

24:14.582 --> 24:16.750
AND?

24:17.750 --> 24:18.834
THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.277
UM...

24:22.377 --> 24:24.237
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT SCARRING

24:24.337 --> 24:27.655
OR SCAR TISSUE.

24:27.755 --> 24:30.365
SOMETHING ABOUT
BLUNT TRAUMA INJURY.

24:30.465 --> 24:33.031
OH, HONEY.

24:33.131 --> 24:34.283
HE ASKED ME
IF I'D SUFFERED

24:34.383 --> 24:36.743
ANY SERIOUS BLOWS
TO THE ABDOMEN.

24:36.843 --> 24:40.135
HE SEEMS TO THINK, UM,
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT...

24:41.303 --> 24:45.137
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE,
FOR ME TO CONCEIVE.

24:46.139 --> 24:49.416
I'M SO SORRY.

24:49.516 --> 24:51.209
THIS IS--IT'S WEIRD.

24:51.309 --> 24:55.186
'CAUSE WHEN
I WENT TO THE FUTURE,
I MET THAT LITTLE GIRL.

24:55.811 --> 24:59.146
I SAW...MY LITTLE GIRL.

25:00.145 --> 25:02.189
AND I SAW WHAT SHE...

25:03.649 --> 25:06.801
LOOKED LIKE
AND WHAT SHE SOUNDED LIKE

25:06.901 --> 25:09.885
AND, UH...

25:09.985 --> 25:12.151
THE SOUND OF HER LAUGH.

25:13.153 --> 25:16.346
I JUST...

25:16.446 --> 25:18.490
I CAN'T IMAGINE
NOT KNOWING HER.

25:20.155 --> 25:22.075
YOU STILL MIGHT.

25:23.450 --> 25:25.077
I MIGHT NOT.

25:26.535 --> 25:28.119
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL LEO.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.706
HE'S SO EXCITED
ABOUT HAVING A BABY.

25:36.164 --> 25:39.650
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN...

25:39.750 --> 25:42.002
AAH!

25:42.752 --> 25:43.920
SHE'S GETTING WORSE.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.071
WELL, CAN'T YOU
DO SOMETHING?

25:48.171 --> 25:49.363
I TRIED TO HEAL HER.
I CAN'T.

25:49.463 --> 25:50.589
STAND BACK.
STAND BACK.

25:50.964 --> 25:52.340
ALL RIGHT, YOU STAY
OUT OF HER SIGHT

25:54.591 --> 25:56.074
FOR YOUR
OWN SAFETY. GO.

25:56.174 --> 25:57.618
OH, MAKE IT STOP!
MAKE IT STOP!

25:57.718 --> 26:00.176
LEO, GO GET
SOME ICE WATER
OR SOMETHING.

26:01.176 --> 26:02.553
ALL RIGHT. IT'S OK.
IT'S OK.

26:04.638 --> 26:06.455
JUST TRY TO
BREATHE THROUGH IT.

26:06.555 --> 26:08.080
BREATHE.

26:08.180 --> 26:10.041
BREATHE. PEACE.

26:10.141 --> 26:12.392
PIPER, LOOK OUT!

26:13.393 --> 26:14.267
UH-OH.
HEY!

26:18.395 --> 26:21.338
GET UP. GET UP.
COME ON.

26:21.438 --> 26:23.088
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

26:23.188 --> 26:24.649
YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME.
I'LL ALWAYS FIND YOU.

26:26.817 --> 26:30.191
PHOEBE,
I'LL ORB YOU!

26:32.069 --> 26:35.137
THAT WASN'T ME.

26:35.237 --> 26:37.530
IT WAS THE BABY.
I COULDN'T CONTROL HIM.

26:47.911 --> 26:51.102
DID YOU SENSE HER?

26:51.202 --> 26:52.354
NO. IF SHE'S
IN THE UNDERWORLD,

26:52.454 --> 26:54.104
I CAN'T GET A READ ON HER.

26:54.204 --> 26:55.355
IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO PAIGE,

26:55.455 --> 26:57.565
I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE MYSELF.

26:57.666 --> 26:59.107
ANYTHING ON
THAT DEMON?

26:59.207 --> 27:01.584
I THINK SO.
COME LOOK.

27:03.961 --> 27:07.487
"ORAL TRADITION
TELLS OF A GIANT

27:07.587 --> 27:10.112
"WHOSE BODY
SERVED AS A PORTAL
TO OTHER DIMENSIONS.

27:10.212 --> 27:13.699
BECAUSE HE WAS
IMPRISONED CENTURIES AGO,

27:13.799 --> 27:16.158
NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT THIS DEMON'S NAME IS

27:16.258 --> 27:18.868
OR IF HE EVEN EXISTS."

27:18.968 --> 27:20.243
IT GETS WORSE.
THERE'S NO KNOWN
VANQUISH FOR HIM.

27:20.343 --> 27:23.119
THE SOURCE
WAS SO THREATENED,

27:23.219 --> 27:24.465
HE CONDEMNED THE GIANT
TO SPEND ETERNITY
IN A CAGE.

27:24.475 --> 27:27.121
THE SEER MUST HAVE SET HIM
FREE TO CAPTURE PHOEBE.

27:27.221 --> 27:30.082
BUT HE GOT
PAIGE INSTEAD,
THANKS TO ME.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.416
NO. THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

27:32.516 --> 27:34.417
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

27:34.517 --> 27:36.126
UH, BETTER. I THINK
THE BABY'S RESTING.

27:36.226 --> 27:38.169
IT'S WHEN
HE'S ACTIVE
AND USING MAGIC

27:38.269 --> 27:40.127
THAT IT HURTS
THE MOST.

27:40.227 --> 27:42.128
MM-HMM.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.130
WELL, HERE.
HAVE SOME ICED TEA.

27:43.230 --> 27:44.940
IT WILL COOL YOU OFF.

27:47.858 --> 27:51.676
WHAT THE HELL?
I CAN'T EVEN ENJOY
SOME ICED TEA?!

27:51.776 --> 27:54.987
UH, IT
WASN'T ICED TEA.

27:56.029 --> 27:58.237
IT WAS
A BINDING POTION.

27:59.405 --> 28:01.138
PAIGE SUGGESTED IT
TO HELP CONTROL THE BABY,

28:01.238 --> 28:04.725
AND I COULDN'T TELL YOU,
BECAUSE IF I DID,

28:04.825 --> 28:06.225
HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED YOU--

28:06.325 --> 28:07.351
HE STOPPED ME ANYWAY.

28:07.451 --> 28:09.185
HE KNOWS THINGS
THAT I DON'T KNOW.

28:09.285 --> 28:11.687
HE'S TRYING
TO TAKE CONTROL OF ME.

28:11.787 --> 28:14.105
YOU CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

28:14.205 --> 28:15.229
IF HE TAKES CONTROL,
HE'LL NEVER LET GO.

28:15.329 --> 28:16.831
I KNOW.

28:18.247 --> 28:19.708
IT'S NOT ME,
AND IT'S NOT COLE.

28:23.585 --> 28:25.377
IT'S THE SOURCE.

28:38.257 --> 28:41.577
SO, WHAT, ARE YOU

28:41.677 --> 28:43.161
INTO SOME KIND
OF DOMINATRIX
THING NOW?

28:43.261 --> 28:44.746
YOU'RE NOT
THE SISTER I EXPECTED,

28:44.846 --> 28:47.413
BUT YOU'LL DO.

28:47.513 --> 28:49.163
SORRY I CAN'T
STICK AROUND,

28:49.263 --> 28:51.849
BUT YOU'RE CREEPING
ME OUT ANYWAY.

28:53.142 --> 28:55.059
[LAUGHING]

28:59.603 --> 29:03.230
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

29:09.273 --> 29:12.551
SO, WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

29:12.651 --> 29:14.095
TRAP PHOEBE
IN THIS CAGE

29:14.195 --> 29:15.271
AND FATTEN HER UP
TILL SHE GIVES BIRTH?

29:15.281 --> 29:16.720
EVEN I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF PATIENCE.

29:16.820 --> 29:20.056
WELL, WHATEVER
YOUR PLAN WAS,

29:20.156 --> 29:22.057
I'M HAPPY
TO SPOIL IT.

29:22.157 --> 29:23.515
YOU DIDN'T SPOIL ANYTHING.

29:23.616 --> 29:25.407
PHOEBE WILL COME TO ME

29:26.617 --> 29:28.393
AS SOON AS
SHE GETS MY MESSAGE.

29:28.493 --> 29:31.745
WHAT MESSAGE?

29:34.913 --> 29:38.065
[GASPS]

29:38.165 --> 29:39.582
AAH!

29:41.750 --> 29:43.459
I SAW THE SEER.
SHE WAS KILLING PAIGE.

29:45.418 --> 29:48.611
HOW CAN YOU
GET A PREMONITION

29:48.711 --> 29:49.696
WITHOUT
TOUCHING ANYTHING?

29:49.796 --> 29:51.030
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THE SEER
SENT IT TO ME.

29:51.130 --> 29:52.379
THAT IS NOT
ALL SHE SENT.

29:53.839 --> 29:55.448
COME WITH ME NOW
OR YOUR SISTER DIES.

29:55.548 --> 29:58.742
YOU'VE
ALREADY SEEN HOW.

29:58.842 --> 30:00.910
NO, PHOEBE, DON'T.

30:01.010 --> 30:02.200
IT'S A TRAP.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.494
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I HAVE TO SAVE PAIGE.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.537
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE LEFT.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.663
NO.

30:06.763 --> 30:07.846
YOU'RE
LETTING THE BABY
CONTROL YOU, PHOEBE.

30:10.139 --> 30:11.415
THAT WASN'T THE BABY!
THAT WAS ME.

30:11.515 --> 30:14.291
I GOT PAIGE INTO THIS MESS.
I'M GONNA GET HER OUT OF IT.

30:14.391 --> 30:16.518
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.939
DAMN IT!

30:25.064 --> 30:25.522
DID THAT
COME FROM YOU?

30:28.398 --> 30:29.632
I'M SORRY, PIPER.
I CAN'T LET YOU

30:29.733 --> 30:30.967
TAKE THE FALL FOR ME.

30:31.067 --> 30:31.968
WELL, WHY NOT?

30:32.068 --> 30:33.777
YOU CAN'T USE
THE BABY'S POWERS LIKE THAT.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.821
COME HERE, WITCH!

30:40.488 --> 30:40.905
PHOEBE, DON'T!

30:50.325 --> 30:54.327
PHOEBE, NOBODY'S
EVER BEEN ABLE TO
VANQUISH THAT DEMON.

30:54.996 --> 30:58.539
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

30:59.330 --> 31:00.207
STAY AWAY.

31:02.457 --> 31:03.875
THAT'S NOT
PHOEBE ANYMORE.

31:09.545 --> 31:12.905
COME TO ME, CHILD.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.157
PHOEBE,
SNAP OUT OF IT.

31:15.257 --> 31:17.240
PLEASE.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.159
LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN
COME TO ME,

31:19.259 --> 31:21.659
FOR THE KINGDOM BELONGS
TO SUCH AS THESE.

31:21.759 --> 31:24.469
THE ROSE CIRCLED
REPRESENTS NATURE,

31:25.303 --> 31:28.513
DESIRE, FERTILITY.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.557
KNEEL.

31:34.724 --> 31:37.877
PHOEBE, IT'S YOUR BODY.
TAKE CONTROL. FIGHT IT.

31:37.977 --> 31:41.251
GIVE ME STRENGTH
AND GIVE ME MIGHT

31:41.351 --> 31:44.421
TO STEAL A CHILD
IN STILL OF NIGHT.

31:44.521 --> 31:48.274
DARKEST FORCES,
LET IT BE.

31:49.107 --> 31:52.650
HEAR MY PLEA!
BRING LIFE TO ME!

32:00.071 --> 32:03.323
MY BABY.

32:04.073 --> 32:05.365
HE WAS NEVER YOURS
OR COLE'S.

32:07.616 --> 32:10.367
FROM THE MOMENT OF CONCEPTION,
THIS BABY WAS MINE.

32:37.840 --> 32:41.408
THE DEADLINE'S PASSED.
SHE'S NOT HERE.

32:41.508 --> 32:44.368
THE THRONE BELONGS TO ME.

32:44.468 --> 32:46.369
WE CAN WAIT ONE MORE--

32:46.469 --> 32:47.553
GIVE ME THE OATH!
I WANT MY POWER!

32:51.388 --> 32:55.249
YOU PROMISED TO BRING
THE SOURCE'S HEIR.

32:55.349 --> 32:58.334
SO...WHERE IS HE?

32:58.434 --> 33:01.392
INSIDE ME.

33:14.984 --> 33:18.301
THE COUNCIL HAS CHOSEN.

33:18.401 --> 33:20.302
THE SEER WILL
BE OUR NEW SOURCE.

33:20.402 --> 33:22.303
NO. IT'S A TRICK.

33:22.403 --> 33:24.404
I BROUGHT
THE COUNCIL A GIFT.

33:33.994 --> 33:37.271
CHARMED ONES.

33:37.371 --> 33:39.522
HOW DARE YOU BRING THEM
INTO OUR SANCTUARY!

33:39.622 --> 33:42.106
THE WITCHES
ARE LOCKED IN A CAGE

33:42.206 --> 33:44.149
FROM WHICH
NO MAGIC CAN ESCAPE.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.316
YOU CAN'T
BE SURE OF THAT.

33:46.416 --> 33:47.500
SO MUCH
NEGATIVE ENERGY.

33:51.418 --> 33:54.421
AAH!

33:58.422 --> 34:02.324
AM I TO PRESUME
THESE WITCHES ARE
THE HUMAN SACRIFICE

34:02.424 --> 34:05.368
REQUIRED TO SEAL
YOUR CORONATION?

34:05.468 --> 34:07.887
HUMAN SACRIFICE?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS
PART OF THE PLAN, DID YOU?

34:08.346 --> 34:11.454
TO BE YOUR SOURCE.

34:11.554 --> 34:14.915
TO START
A NEW EVIL ORDER.

34:15.014 --> 34:17.792
TO KILL
THE CHARMED ONES.

34:17.891 --> 34:20.751
THIS WAS MY VISION
FROM THE BEGINNING.

34:20.851 --> 34:24.228
EVERY COUNCIL LEADER
HERE WILL REAP
THE REWARDS--

34:25.771 --> 34:27.563
WHAT IS IT?

34:29.106 --> 34:30.714
JUST START THE CEREMONY.

34:30.813 --> 34:32.674
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S HAVING ANY MORE LUCK

34:32.774 --> 34:34.300
WITH THAT THING
INSIDE OF HER THAN YOU WERE.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.926
MAY THE WORLD'S EVIL FLOW
THROUGH YOUR SOUL TONIGHT...

34:36.025 --> 34:38.302
UH, SORRY.
THAT WAS INSENSITIVE.

34:38.402 --> 34:40.762
IT'S OK.
THE BABY
WASN'T MINE.

34:40.862 --> 34:42.344
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:42.444 --> 34:45.098
THE BABY WAS NEVER MINE.

34:45.197 --> 34:46.639
FROM THE MOMENT
IT TOOK OVER,

34:46.739 --> 34:48.014
IT JUST FELT LIKE
THIS BLACK HOLE OF EVIL.

34:48.114 --> 34:50.283
TOTALLY SOULLESS.

34:50.909 --> 34:52.449
PHOEBE?
YEAH?

34:54.328 --> 34:55.911
I TOLD YA SO.

34:58.079 --> 35:01.354
I'M REALLY SORRY.

35:01.454 --> 35:02.898
I KNOW YOU ARE, HONEY.
I KNOW YOU ARE.

35:02.998 --> 35:04.607
SEER, ARE YOU PREPARED
TO ACCEPT THE POWER

35:04.707 --> 35:07.692
AND POSITION
OF THE SOURCE

35:07.792 --> 35:09.359
BEFORE ALL THESE LEADERS
OF THE UNDERWORLD?

35:09.459 --> 35:11.359
I AM.

35:11.459 --> 35:12.528
OK, SO NOW WHAT?

35:12.628 --> 35:14.196
WE MIGHT HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE
IF WE HAD THE POWER OF THREE,

35:14.296 --> 35:15.905
BUT WE CAN'T GET TO PIPER.
THIS CAGE IS MAGIC-PROOF.

35:16.005 --> 35:19.282
OK, SO THE CAGE
WAS BUILT TO MAKE SURE
MAGIC WOULDN'T GET OUT,

35:19.382 --> 35:22.365
BUT IN
THE PREMONITION I HAD,

35:22.465 --> 35:23.993
I SAW THE SEER
KILL YOU WITH A POWER.

35:24.093 --> 35:26.367
SO THE CAGE LETS MAGIC IN.

35:26.467 --> 35:28.368
DO YOU REMEMBER THE SPELL
"TO CALL A LOST WITCH"?

35:28.468 --> 35:29.912
PIPER AND I
JUST USED IT
TO TRY TO FIND YOU.

35:30.012 --> 35:32.163
UH, POWERS OF
THE WITCHES RISE,

35:32.263 --> 35:35.207
COURSE UNSEEN
ACROSS THE SKIES...

35:35.307 --> 35:37.373
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

35:37.473 --> 35:39.959
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING MISSING.

35:40.059 --> 35:41.375
SOMETHING WE
HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.376
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IF WE SUMMON A DEMON,

35:43.476 --> 35:45.920
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE
WAY TO THE SEER'S LAIR,

35:46.020 --> 35:48.897
HE CAN LEAD US
TO...PHOEBE AND PAIGE.

35:50.479 --> 35:52.480
OH.

35:53.565 --> 35:54.507
OH, THANK GOD
IT WORKED.

35:54.608 --> 35:56.259
OH, MY.
WHERE ARE WE?

35:56.359 --> 35:58.552
UH, TRAPPED
IN A CAGE.

35:58.652 --> 36:00.987
MM-HMM. OK.
SO LET'S BUST OUT.

36:02.405 --> 36:03.637
NO. YOU CAN'T USE
YOUR MAGIC IN HERE.

36:03.737 --> 36:05.597
IT'LL JUST BOUNCE OFF
AND PROBABLY KILL US.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.599
Dark Priest:
REPEAT THE OATH AFTER ME.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.766
UH, WHAT'S
GOIN' ON OUT THERE?

36:10.866 --> 36:13.018
THE SEER IS
BEING CORONATED
AS THE NEW SOURCE.

36:13.118 --> 36:15.392
MM-HMM.

36:15.492 --> 36:16.489
YEAH. AND THEN
SHE'S GONNA SACRIFICE US.

36:16.499 --> 36:18.896
<i>OCCIDIT UNA DOMUS.</i>

36:18.996 --> 36:20.897
<i>OCCIDIT UNA DOMUS.</i>

36:20.997 --> 36:23.106
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU GUYS SUMMONED ME
INTO A CAGE

36:23.206 --> 36:25.274
WHERE MY POWERS DON'T WORK

36:25.374 --> 36:27.482
SO WE COULD ALL
DIE TOGETHER?!

36:27.582 --> 36:29.109
WELL, THE PLAN HAS
SOME FLAWS, ADMITTEDLY.

36:29.209 --> 36:32.527
<i>OMNES QUAS MERUERE
PATI POENAS.</i>

36:32.627 --> 36:35.402
LOOK, WE HAVE
TO STAY POSITIVE.

36:35.503 --> 36:36.403
WE HAVE THE POWER
OF THREE HERE.

36:36.503 --> 36:37.780
THERE IS
NOTHING STRONGER
THAN THAT, RIGHT?

36:37.880 --> 36:39.505
<i>OMNES QUAS MERUERE
PATI POENAS.</i>

37:00.225 --> 37:04.436
ARE YA SURE THERE'S
NOTHING STRONGER THAN
THE POWER OF THREE?

37:23.527 --> 37:26.931
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE.

37:27.031 --> 37:29.906
YOU'VE JUST MADE MY--

37:33.658 --> 37:36.936
IT'S THE BABY.

37:37.036 --> 37:38.478
HE HAS TOO MUCH
POWER FOR HER.

37:38.578 --> 37:40.079
THAT'S HOW I FELT.
I FELT LIKE
I WAS GONNA EXPLODE.

37:40.536 --> 37:42.747
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

37:43.831 --> 37:44.731
WE NEED TO MAKE HER

37:44.831 --> 37:45.899
TAP INTO THE BABY'S
POWER, ALL OF IT.

37:45.999 --> 37:48.333
HOW THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

37:49.959 --> 37:54.070
I COMMAND ALL IN ATTENDANCE
TO WITNESS THE POWER
OF THE SOURCE

37:54.170 --> 37:57.571
AND THE DEATH OF
THE CHARMED ONES.

37:57.671 --> 37:58.655
POWER OF THREE SPELL?

37:58.755 --> 38:00.446
FOLLOW
ALONG, OK?

38:00.546 --> 38:02.115
Sisters: THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:02.215 --> 38:03.950
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:04.050 --> 38:05.784
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE...

38:05.884 --> 38:08.451
WHAT'S WRONG?

38:08.551 --> 38:09.452
NOTHING'S WRONG!

38:09.552 --> 38:12.137
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:13.430 --> 38:15.206
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:15.306 --> 38:17.498
IT'S WORKING!
KEEP GOING.

38:17.598 --> 38:19.456
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:19.556 --> 38:21.209
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:21.309 --> 38:23.458
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:23.558 --> 38:25.919
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:26.019 --> 38:28.504
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:28.604 --> 38:30.562
THE POWER OF THREE
WILL SET US FREE.

38:38.193 --> 38:41.567
WHERE'D
EVERYBODY GO?

38:45.529 --> 38:48.889
THE BLAST TOOK
EVERYONE OUT.

38:48.989 --> 38:51.472
THE SEER, THE
COUNCIL LEADERS.

38:51.572 --> 38:54.034
WELL, I'D SAY
THAT THE SCALES
OF GOOD AND EVIL

38:55.575 --> 38:58.894
JUST DRAMATICALLY TIPPED
IN OUR FAVOR.

38:58.994 --> 39:01.479
OH, LOOK, THE <i>GRIMOIRE,
</i> STILL UNTOUCHED.

39:01.579 --> 39:04.897
IT'S TIME
TO GET RID
OF THAT BOOK

39:04.997 --> 39:06.580
ONCE
AND FOR ALL.

39:22.507 --> 39:26.117
WELL, THE <i>GRIMOIRE
</i> HAS A NEW HOME

39:26.217 --> 39:28.201
IN A MOUNTAIN OF ROCK
IN THE WEST ANDES.

39:28.301 --> 39:30.995
THANKS, HONEY.

39:31.095 --> 39:32.494
SURE.

39:32.594 --> 39:33.595
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE WE VANQUISHED
THE SOURCE NOW?

39:34.971 --> 39:37.497
THREE, BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

39:37.597 --> 39:39.873
DID WE GET HIM?

39:39.973 --> 39:41.498
I THINK THAT
WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY,

39:41.598 --> 39:43.126
BASED ON HOW
THE ELDERS ARE REACTING.

39:43.226 --> 39:44.960
IT'S LIKE A HOLIDAY
UP THERE.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.961
THEY STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU DID IT.

39:47.061 --> 39:48.645
YEAH, WELL, LET'S
NOT FORGET THE COST.

39:50.146 --> 39:52.730
WELL, I GOTTA SAY,
AFTER ALL THIS,

39:53.730 --> 39:56.191
I'M STILL LOOKING FORWARD
TO HAVING A GOOD BABY
IN THIS HOUSE.

40:00.026 --> 40:03.386
YEAH, I HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT YET.

40:03.486 --> 40:06.304
I HEARD FROM
DR. HARRIS TODAY.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.638
AND?

40:08.738 --> 40:09.764
AND WE'RE IN
FOR A ROUGH ROAD.

40:09.864 --> 40:12.514
A ROUGH ROAD?

40:12.614 --> 40:14.515
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

40:14.615 --> 40:15.892
SHH. IT'S OK.

40:15.992 --> 40:18.144
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE'RE GIVING IN
OR GIVING UP.

40:18.244 --> 40:21.078
THERE ARE
A LOT OF OPTIONS
IN THE WORLD.

40:21.412 --> 40:24.520
DON'T WORRY.

40:24.620 --> 40:25.689
DON'T WORRY, LEO.
I'M SURE THE CHARMED LINE

40:25.789 --> 40:28.522
ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO END WITH US.

40:28.622 --> 40:30.333
UM, PHOEBE.

40:33.001 --> 40:34.544
I FOUND THIS
IN, UH, COLE'S SAFE.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.754
IT'S FOR YOU.

40:54.679 --> 40:58.639
"IF I'M DEAD RIGHT NOW,
I KNOW IT WAS AT YOUR HAND.

40:59.098 --> 41:02.958
NO ONE ELSE IN HEAVEN
OR HELL HAD POWER OVER ME.

41:03.058 --> 41:06.643
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I WAS DEAD BEFORE I MET YOU.

41:07.352 --> 41:10.879
I WAS BORN THE DAY
YOU LOVED ME,

41:10.979 --> 41:12.980
AND MY LOVE FOR YOU
WILL KEEP ME ALIVE FOREVER."

41:24.236 --> 41:27.488
HELP ME.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.556
PHOEBE.

41:31.656 --> 41:32.823
COLE?
