Our sources tracked her

09:20.851 --> 09:23.604
No, they are the right skill set
for this op,

09:23.688 --> 09:26.983

it will force Riley and Desi

Patching into
their system now.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.686

your electronics

10:03.769 --> 10:05.688

with the outside world.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.606

low-tech tablets

11:22.431 --> 11:24.433
I figured.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.436
I have ten million
reasons why you're gonna

11:27.520 --> 11:29.313
tell us.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.065
What is your dad's problem?

11:31.148 --> 11:32.066
What?

11:32.149 --> 11:35.361
Dad? I'm not his dad, all right?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.572
Now talk.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.410
All right. The Grand employs

11:42.493 --> 11:44.412
the best plastic surgeons
in Europe.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.913
Patients get a new face

11:45.996 --> 11:48.916
and a new identity
to go right along with it.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.418
They only keep
paper records. That way,

11:50.501 --> 11:51.585
there's no digital trail.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.171
You know, ensure
complete secrecy.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.965
So they can't connect the old
identity with the new one.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.300
Yeah, exactly.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.140
So, Paula
doesn't look like Paula.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.183
Great.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.144
If you can find out what
work Paula had done,

12:08.227 --> 12:09.812
I can input it into
a prosthetics software program.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.147
It can construct

12:11.230 --> 12:13.315
an image of what
Paula looks like now.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.610
Unfortunately, I can't
hack paper records.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.154
Which means
we're gonna have to steal them.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.114
Okay, get the hospital specs

12:20.197 --> 12:22.158
so I can find a way to sneak in
without anybody notic...

12:22.241 --> 12:23.993
Yes, hi. Um,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.829
when's your next
available appointment?

12:29.039 --> 12:31.292
Oh. You can take me now.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.794
That's great.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.297
Got us in at the spa.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.551
What?

12:38.757 --> 12:40.551
Your bullet wound is fake.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.011
Yeah, I know. Okay, relax.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.929
I got this.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.309
Trust me.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.435

12:51.270 --> 12:54.356
Hello, my dears. I am Susie.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.150

13:00.613 --> 13:02.990
Thank you.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.990

13:03.073 --> 13:04.492
what's bothering you.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.492
Yeah, sure.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.285

DESI:
Bozer's pneumatic

13:13.959 --> 13:16.045
tube lipstick thingamajiggy

13:16.128 --> 13:17.713
was supposed to
be a last resort.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.257

13:20.341 --> 13:23.385

are meant to be played with.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.724
(grunts)

13:27.306 --> 13:28.724
SUSIE: Ah.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.018
Looks like a bullet
bounced off a rib.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.521
(gasps)

13:33.604 --> 13:36.607
(grunts)

13:33.604 --> 13:36.607
It's subcutaneous.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.901
Ah, close range,

13:38.984 --> 13:40.569
gunpowder residue.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.695
You're very lucky.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.782
I'll page the doctor,
and she will

13:44.865 --> 13:47.284
get that removed
and stitched up right away.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.579
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.505
Okay.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.924
Canceling the doctor's page.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.301
Calling the nurse to an
emergency on the 14th floor.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.304
Should buy us enough time
to find Paula's records.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.722
Huh?

14:07.388 --> 14:08.722
Let's go.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.267
(scoffs)

14:15.229 --> 14:16.230
Okay.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.107
MATTY: Hey, you need to
compare patient records

14:18.190 --> 14:19.733
with medical prescriptions.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.611
There's blood thinners used
both pre and post facial surgery

14:22.695 --> 14:24.780
that will link
Paula's two identities.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.865
We're looking for files
dated three weeks ago.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.499
Here.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.168
Perfect.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.800
So, are we good?

14:44.883 --> 14:47.469
Uh-huh.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.469
Really?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.805
'Cause you've been extra
monosyllabic, even for you.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.807
Huh?

14:51.890 --> 14:54.435
See what I'm talking about?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.606
Look. Patient 247.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.318
That's got to be Paula.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.945
Uploading this to Bozer now.

resort security.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.418
We need to hide.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.837
I have an idea.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.214
Follow my lead.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.844
Gentlemen.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.596

They're two of Salazar's men.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.285
Clearly trying
to find Paula.

don't report back.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.998
MATTY: Mac,

17:21.081 --> 17:22.791
Taylor, you got to get in there
and watch their backs.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.334
MacGYVER:
Okay.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.628
Vincent, how would you like
your freedom, your money,

17:26.712 --> 17:28.255
and your dad to be
none the wiser?

17:28.338 --> 17:29.631
And what about my caviar?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.759
Oh, I'll throw in the caviar,
for sure.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.302
Okay. Well, now you're talking.
What do you need?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.137
We need you to check us
into the Zurich Grand

17:35.220 --> 17:36.472
as your new business partners.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.973
Once you're in, you
withdraw your cash,

17:38.057 --> 17:39.767
you split it with us,
and then we let you go.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
Mac.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
All of this goes away.

Just trust me.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.569
(chuckles softly)

17:50.652 --> 17:52.821
What?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.821
I have reason,
given your track record

17:52.905 --> 17:55.657
of becoming overly involved
with previous Phoenix targets.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.118
The Merchant.
Your aunt.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.579
And you have a track record
of becoming overly involved

18:00.662 --> 18:02.206
due to your
personal vendettas.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.665
Leland killing your
Spearhead team.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.917
For all I know, Salazar

18:05.000 --> 18:06.293
killed your mom.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.293
Come on. Salazar?

18:06.376 --> 18:07.836
This is totally different.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.214
Vincent is totally different.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.214
You bought him

18:10.297 --> 18:12.341
caviar.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.341
Really, Mr. Psyops? Let me
educate you for a second.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.343
Establishing trust with
a hostage is far better

18:14.426 --> 18:15.385
than threats of violence.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.678
Oh, yes, because
that worked a treat

18:16.762 --> 18:18.388
when your Auntie Gwen
used it on you.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.973
And she helped us beat Codex.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.351
So I say we use this guy
right here to get Salazar,

18:22.434 --> 18:24.311
unless you would rather drop
a bomb on the Zurich Grand

18:24.394 --> 18:25.395

Pick five you
don't need, or act.

21:56.815 --> 21:57.774
Okay.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.276
(low grunting)

22:00.777 --> 22:02.571
♪ ♪

22:09.286 --> 22:11.079
SALAZAR:
Buenas noches.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.622
I am worried.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.916
I was supposed to meet
my friends here,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.127
and I can't seem to find them.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.128
Sorry, toots.
You know,

22:18.211 --> 22:20.255
not allowed to discuss

22:20.338 --> 22:21.590
anything about
the other guests.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.633
You know how they
are about the rules.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.802
Ah, Vincent.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.262
Take a seat,
you handsome devil.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.973
I'll be right with you.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.268
VINCENT: Take your time,
my love, take your time.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.268
Oh...

22:33.351 --> 22:35.270
I suppose it's okay
if I take a look for myself?

22:35.353 --> 22:36.605
Oh, no, it would not be,
cupcake.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.690
MacGYVER:
Diluted in small doses,

22:38.774 --> 22:41.276
tea tree oil has healing
properties.

22:41.359 --> 22:44.196
But in high quantities, heat
will bind it to the ammonia

22:44.279 --> 22:46.239
in the window cleaner,
and you have yourself

22:46.323 --> 22:47.908
an effective deterrent.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.994
(quietly):
Wait for my signal.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.246
RILEY: Copy that.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.246
I'd cover your noses
if I were you.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.959
(all coughing)

22:58.043 --> 22:59.336
SALAZAR:
What the hell is that?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.505
Dez, Riles, go.
We're gonna follow Salazar.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.798
Please follow me.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.300
Headed to Paula's room.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.469
(coughing)

23:05.384 --> 23:07.469
There they are. Let's go.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.558
Ever at your service, Vincent.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.185
Huh?

23:15.268 --> 23:17.312
Now, who are these two?

23:17.395 --> 23:19.648
I honestly have no idea.

23:19.731 --> 23:22.984
But granddad over here
is very rude.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.694
Vincent, what the hell?

23:24.778 --> 23:26.822
My dad's perfectly fine, guys.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.198
"Under the weather"
is hotel code for

23:28.281 --> 23:30.826
being with undesirables.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.162
You are making
such a big mistake.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.164
Am I?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.457
When our associates
don't hear from us,

23:37.541 --> 23:38.834
they will call your daddy.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.919
By the time they realize,
I'll be long gone.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.379
Egor has everything
that I need

23:42.462 --> 23:44.423
here at the Grand for me to
get my paper and disappear.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.261
Hey, I'm really sorry to have to
do you like this, though, man.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.304
Bye.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.392
(British accent):
Room service.

24:11.491 --> 24:12.868
Get back!

24:11.491 --> 24:12.868
Whoa. Whoa. Hey.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.035
Hands up. Hands up!

24:12.951 --> 24:14.035
Hey.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.872
Who the hell are you?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.291
Is that ceramic?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.336
How'd you get that
past security?

24:23.420 --> 24:24.546
Ew. Don't want to know.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.131
I'm not going
to ask you again.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.382
Who are you?

24:26.214 --> 24:27.382
Long story short,

24:27.465 --> 24:29.134
Salazar's checked in,

24:29.217 --> 24:31.052
he wants to kill you,

24:31.136 --> 24:33.054
and we're here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.224
Lots of people want
to kill me.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.684
How do I know
you aren't one of them?

24:37.767 --> 24:40.395
'Cause we're the good guys?

24:40.478 --> 24:42.063
Speak for yourself.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.740
I'm here because death
is far too good

24:51.823 --> 24:53.783
for a bastard like Salazar.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.285
I need to see him
rotting in a cell,

24:55.368 --> 24:58.413
like a caged rat.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.248
Abandoned by his family,

25:00.332 --> 25:03.043
forgotten by the world.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.671
Go on.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.134
I trusted Salazar.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.431
Opened up.

25:16.514 --> 25:17.766
Thought I'd found my family.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.267
But I was a fool
to trust anyone.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.395
He double-crossed me.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.772
Left me for dead.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.277
I'm here because
I need you to testify.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.948
Put him away.
For me, for your son.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.575
For the countless
other lives he's ruined.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.870
Make him pay, Paula.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.627
I can't testify.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.629
But I have something better.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.798
All the evidence
on a hard drive.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.134
The books.
Where the bodies are buried.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.303
I checked it in with Egor
for safekeeping.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.097
It's in a vault
in the basement.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.640
If you get me
out of here alive,

25:58.723 --> 25:59.599
it's yours.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.272
All right, you got yourself
a deal.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.690
But you need to leave
that gun here.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.858
There might be metal
detectors on the way.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.735
Resort rules.

26:12.696 --> 26:16.574
Okay... now she wants
to follow the rules.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.623
Welcome to our RHT rooms.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.709
Radiant heat temperature?

26:25.792 --> 26:27.794
Ransom, hostage
and troublemakers.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.296
The Grand must accommodate
the unique needs

26:29.379 --> 26:30.672
of all our guests.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.674
Please, make
yourselves at home.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.889
Matty, do you copy?

26:39.973 --> 26:41.516
Matty?

26:41.599 --> 26:42.851
They only left one guard.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.353
'Cause the room's really secure.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.314
Reinforced walls, I'm guessing,

26:47.397 --> 26:49.858
to keep our comms
from getting through.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.527
Bars on the windows,
and I don't see any vents

26:52.610 --> 26:53.903
big enough to crawl through.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.740
Well, you could just
call your friend Vincent.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.992
Offer him some ice cream
if he lets us out.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.869
You know, I told you
he couldn't be trusted.

27:00.952 --> 27:01.786
I never claimed that
we could trust him.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.499
The real question is,

27:06.583 --> 27:08.835
do you trust me enough
to get us out of here?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.176
I guess I could really
leave you cuffed.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.761
(chuckles)

27:19.763 --> 27:22.766
Angus...

27:22.849 --> 27:25.560
I trust you to
get us out of here.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.355
Honestly, how hard was that?

27:31.608 --> 27:34.194
All right, so here's the deal.

27:34.277 --> 27:36.071
Walls in bathrooms are
plumbed next to each other,

27:36.154 --> 27:37.655
so there's a chance...

27:36.154 --> 27:37.655
Don't hurt me.

27:41.659 --> 27:44.871
Yeah, we're not here
to hurt you.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.709
No, we got into a bit
of a pickle at the resort,

27:49.793 --> 27:50.919
and we're locked up, too.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.420
They didn't lock me up.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.631
Well, then, why are you here?

27:54.714 --> 27:56.966
My boss tracked me here.
I figured

27:57.050 --> 28:00.428
an RHT room would be
the last place he'd look.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.931
You're Paula.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.307
Paula Matos.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.979
So much for the Grand's
famed anonymity!

28:10.063 --> 28:12.565
New face, new life.
Don't ask any questions.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.984
(mutters in Portuguese)

28:15.068 --> 28:17.612
Lying sons of bitches!

28:15.068 --> 28:17.612
MacGYVER: Look, you're
the reason we're here.

28:17.695 --> 28:18.696
We're trying to get you out.

28:17.695 --> 28:18.696
If you're Paula...

28:20.865 --> 28:23.451
...then who the dickens are
Desi and Riley with?

28:36.464 --> 28:37.924
(beeping)

28:55.066 --> 28:57.694
Good job back there...

28:57.777 --> 28:59.362
getting her to come with us.

29:01.739 --> 29:04.909
But that speech about
opening up... and family?

29:07.537 --> 29:09.497
Come on, Dez, talk to me.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.000
When Mac gassed me and Taylor,
and went to join Codex,

29:12.083 --> 29:14.669
you charged after him-- why?

29:14.752 --> 29:17.464
Because I trust Mac.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.591
The question is,
why didn't you?

29:21.217 --> 29:24.179
Maybe I would have
if you'd asked me.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.347
Ah.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.347
But you didn't
let me in on the plan,

29:26.431 --> 29:28.224
and you just bailed.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.224
Maybe because you were too busy

29:28.308 --> 29:29.851
planning to drop a bomb
on Mac's head...

29:29.934 --> 29:32.854
That wasn't my plan.
And I stopped the bomb.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.022
We stopped Codex.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.698
Let's get Paula
the hell out of here.

29:46.117 --> 29:50.330
Why don't you hold on
to this for safekeeping.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.334
Now she trusts me.

29:57.462 --> 30:01.216
I'll take that hard drive now.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.592
(chuckles)

30:02.675 --> 30:05.970
I swear I saw you leave that.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.473
Got lots of tricks up my sleeve.

30:08.556 --> 30:11.392
It's amazing what a little
hair dye and makeup will do.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.855
Who the hell are you?

30:14.103 --> 30:15.855
Call me Jane.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.566
See, when Salazar put out
a hit on Paula Matos,

30:18.650 --> 30:19.859
I blew it off.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.903
But then he added
a bonus for some

30:21.986 --> 30:23.530
hard drive of evidence
that she had.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.031
And I figured while
all the no-necks

30:25.114 --> 30:26.616
are going after
the blood price,

30:26.699 --> 30:30.745
I'll grab his financials and
sell them to the highest bidder.

30:30.828 --> 30:31.579
So what'd you do
with the real Paula?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.081
She's around here somewhere.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.250
I tracked her here, same as you.
Hung out at the spa

30:35.333 --> 30:38.211
until I saw one face stop
coming, and another face start.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.880
That was in case somebody
caught you searching her room.

30:40.964 --> 30:41.756
The hard drive, now,

30:41.839 --> 30:44.759
or your friend dies.

30:44.842 --> 30:48.388
I'm supposed to believe
you two are super spies

30:48.471 --> 30:50.473
who are gonna save me from
the most murder-y gangster

30:50.557 --> 30:53.268
in the western hemisphere?

30:50.557 --> 30:53.268
Yes. Look, I promise...

30:53.351 --> 30:55.603
PAULA: These rooms are built for
hostages and kidnap victims.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.605
We're not getting out.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.605
My colleague has a talent

30:57.689 --> 30:59.107
for looking at anything--

30:59.190 --> 31:01.734
problems, objects, people--

31:01.818 --> 31:04.112
and seeing what others don't.

31:04.195 --> 31:08.157
His methods are unorthodox.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.494
He doesn't always do
what I think he should do,

31:11.578 --> 31:14.998
but his gift is

31:15.081 --> 31:16.791
what makes him the best.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.798
Despite my colleague's
dubious past,

31:23.881 --> 31:27.093
and tendency to withhold
personal vendettas,

31:27.176 --> 31:30.179
in the end, he always does
the right thing.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.856
Am I supposed to say something?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.856
Right. Ready?

31:39.939 --> 31:42.317
MacGYVER:
Okay, here's how to
get out of a locked room.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.986
The magnetic field
of the motor's induction coil

31:45.069 --> 31:46.821
moves the critical components
within the lock's chamber,

31:46.904 --> 31:48.239
allowing a dead bolt
to be withdrawn,

31:48.323 --> 31:50.950
transforming a common
household item

31:51.034 --> 31:52.910
into a powerful lockpick.

31:56.914 --> 31:58.958
The hard drive.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.669
Just give her
the hard drive, Dez.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.547
If I give it to her, she's just
gonna shoot you anyway.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.133
Relax. Okay?

32:07.216 --> 32:09.344
I got this.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.224
You... did not just
tell me to relax.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.517
Okay? Out of

32:16.601 --> 32:19.312
everyone here,
you need to relax the most.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.064
Oh, that's rich.
I need to relax?

32:21.147 --> 32:22.899
Yes.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.899
Look at you. You're all
high-strung, walking around here

32:22.982 --> 32:24.567
with an attitude
all the time.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.567
Attitude?

32:24.651 --> 32:25.777
I don't know why you're upset.
You're blowing the mission!

32:25.860 --> 32:27.320
I...

32:25.860 --> 32:27.320
Shut up, both of you!

32:27.403 --> 32:28.988
And give me
the damn drive.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.157
Fine.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.160
Like we said, just relax!

32:35.620 --> 32:36.996
(grunts)

32:37.080 --> 32:38.956
Go. Up! Up! Up!

32:42.126 --> 32:43.378
There they are!

32:43.461 --> 32:45.546
Down, down, down!

32:58.267 --> 32:59.852
It's locked.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.356
Buy me two minutes?

33:03.439 --> 33:04.357
You got it.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.528
(grunting)

33:11.489 --> 33:13.533
(yelling)

33:15.284 --> 33:16.577
(grunting)

33:29.632 --> 33:32.051
Two minutes may have been
optimistic.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.763
(grunting)

33:37.932 --> 33:39.100
(yells)

33:39.183 --> 33:41.102
(yells)

33:39.183 --> 33:41.102
(beeping)

33:41.185 --> 33:43.896
(groans)

33:43.980 --> 33:45.857
(yells)

33:43.980 --> 33:45.857
(grunts)

33:48.317 --> 33:50.236
We're in. Let's go.

33:52.655 --> 33:53.781
Headed south
on the second floor.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.491
Salazar is in pursuit.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.243
All right. We're headed your way
with the real Paula.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.786
Unfortunately, the concierge's
guards aren't far behind.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.457
Hey.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.457
Any idea on how
to get out of here?

34:02.540 --> 34:03.958
You're the idea guy.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.127
I know a way out.
Follow me.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.879
How do we know you're not
leading us into a trap?

34:07.962 --> 34:10.465
'Cause I want to get out of this
damn hotel more than you do.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.302
All right, let's
follow her. Come on.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.971
The resort converted
the old servants' hallways

34:17.054 --> 34:19.140
into secret passages
so that the resort staff

34:19.223 --> 34:20.767
and security can get around.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.894
Just like Disneyland.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.898
Whoa.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.483
Once Riley hacks the elevator,

34:28.566 --> 34:30.193
we'll be able to escape
from the lobby.

34:30.276 --> 34:32.695
I'm locked out.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.363
EGOR:
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:34.447 --> 34:36.949
we have discovered
unwanted guests in the hotel.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.494
We kindly request
that you remain in your room,

34:39.577 --> 34:42.663
under lockdown,
until the matter is resolved.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.874
And once again,
have a pleasant stay

34:44.957 --> 34:47.835
at the Zurich Grand Resort
and Spa.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.927
I knew I should have stayed
in the bathroom.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.303
We will get you out of here.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.013
I can get us out of here
if I build us a pulley.

34:59.096 --> 35:00.556
I just need an initial burst
of lift.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.517
You thinking what I'm thinking?

35:02.600 --> 35:04.894
Yeah. Mac, follow us
to the surgical suite.

35:04.977 --> 35:07.021
Can you barricade the door?

35:08.064 --> 35:09.524
(phone vibrates)

35:09.607 --> 35:11.526
Our friends are in the spa.

35:13.694 --> 35:17.031
Tell all housekeeping personnel
to meet me in the spa.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.533
With the guns.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.034
All the guns.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.251
Dez, can you wrap
the surgical tubing

35:28.334 --> 35:29.919
around the support beams?

35:30.002 --> 35:31.629
And can you
help me get these?

35:31.712 --> 35:33.506
(grunting)

35:50.982 --> 35:52.316
Use your feet.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.944
(banging on door)

35:55.027 --> 35:56.404
(men grunting)

35:56.487 --> 35:58.114
Okay, everybody grab
one of these,

35:58.197 --> 35:59.740
loop 'em around your wrist.
Paula?

35:59.824 --> 36:03.578
On the count of three,
you two smash the valves.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.289
It'll boost 'em
across the floor, pulling us up.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.623
PAULA:
Wait.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.625
You trust
that this thing will hold us?

36:09.709 --> 36:11.502
(banging on door)

36:16.632 --> 36:18.634
ALL:
Yes.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.387
(grunting)

36:18.718 --> 36:21.387
Use your weapons!

36:21.470 --> 36:22.930
MacGYVER:
One.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.015
Two. Three!

36:25.975 --> 36:29.061
(all yelling)

36:29.145 --> 36:30.938
(glass shatters)

36:31.022 --> 36:33.733
MacGYVER:
Pressure is often only seen

36:33.816 --> 36:35.276
as something negative,
but all it takes

36:35.359 --> 36:37.945
is a small change in direction--
in this case,

36:38.029 --> 36:39.906
surgical tubing looped
over a beam

36:39.989 --> 36:41.949
and the team's renewed
commitment to trust--

36:42.033 --> 36:44.452
to change pressure from
something that shatters

36:44.535 --> 36:46.537
to something that uplifts.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.917
PAULA:
I-I still can't believe

36:51.000 --> 36:54.420
the whole flying tank things
actually worked.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.130
He pulls it off, every time.

36:56.213 --> 36:58.424
Well, it's really
all in the physics,

36:58.507 --> 37:00.343
'cause if you change the
direction of an applied motion,

37:00.426 --> 37:02.637
you can lift anything,
including this airplane.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.472
I'm sorry to interrupt
this science lesson.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.140
That was Matilda.
Everything's been arranged

37:06.223 --> 37:09.310
for you to testify
in exchange for your immunity.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.853
RILEY:
And...

37:10.937 --> 37:13.856
I have a little something
to ensure Salazar

37:13.940 --> 37:15.775
never sees the light
of day again.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.235
Am I supposed
to know what that is?

37:19.403 --> 37:21.280
That is all the data

37:19.403 --> 37:21.280
from the hard drive

37:21.364 --> 37:22.531
you checked in
with the concierge.

37:23.449 --> 37:25.201
PAULA:
How'd you get it?

37:31.165 --> 37:33.042
Thank you.

37:33.125 --> 37:36.295
I backed everything up just in
case Salazar went after my son.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.673
Speaking of your son Luis,
we sent a team to pick him up,

37:38.756 --> 37:41.133
so he should be waiting for you
when you arrive.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.468
Thank you.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.512
All of you. Thank you so much.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.681
You're all...

37:46.764 --> 37:48.474
unorthodox, aren't you?

37:48.557 --> 37:50.685
TAYLOR:
That is

37:50.768 --> 37:52.228
an understatement.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.605
(clears throat)

38:06.617 --> 38:08.577
Let me ask you something.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.204
Mm-hmm.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.999
If you had the data, why did you
give me the hard drive to carry?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.712
It was a misdirect.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.548
I knew something was off
about our Paula.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.720
That why you didn't let me in
on the plan... again?

38:25.803 --> 38:28.222
No.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.061
Ever since Codex,
there's been this...

38:34.145 --> 38:36.230
wall up between us.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.608
So...

38:40.818 --> 38:42.903
Well, that's my fault.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.364
I'm still angry at you
for going after Mac.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.076
I did it to protect him.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.911
I know.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.247
But you're right. I...

38:53.330 --> 38:56.709
I didn't let you in
on the plan, and I'm sorry.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.756
Truth is...

39:01.839 --> 39:03.591
I was angry at myself
for believing

39:03.674 --> 39:06.177
you'd both gone over to Codex.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.639
I regret not
trusting you.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.560
I was hoping
you could forgive me.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.774
We're cool, Riles.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.774
Good.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.400
'Cause I have
a confession to make.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.902
I hate my new place.

39:22.985 --> 39:26.906
My next-door neighbor--
he blasts Macklemore 24/7.

39:26.989 --> 39:29.617
I also have a
confession to make.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.078
I've never been to a spa.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.412
Really?

39:33.496 --> 39:34.622
Yeah.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.415
How do you relax?

39:36.499 --> 39:38.626
I hit things.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.294
That explains so much about you.

39:40.377 --> 39:41.921
(both laugh)

39:42.004 --> 39:44.131
LUIS:
Mama!

39:44.215 --> 39:46.175
Luis!

39:49.678 --> 39:53.432
Um, for what
it's worth,

39:53.516 --> 39:54.809
I think we all assumed

39:54.892 --> 39:56.894
that everything would go back
to normal after Codex.

39:56.977 --> 40:00.981
Well, it did... mostly.

40:01.065 --> 40:04.652
I became so focused
on your past mistakes

40:04.735 --> 40:07.613
that I... I was
blind to my own.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.281
And I'm sorry.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.660
Fresh start?

40:14.745 --> 40:15.704
To making new mistakes.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.791
To think that he, uh...

40:18.874 --> 40:20.793
(laughs) He thought
I was your father?

40:20.876 --> 40:22.461
Yeah, ridiculous,
isn't it?

40:20.876 --> 40:22.461
Yeah.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.005
Dashing older brother,
perhaps, but...

40:25.089 --> 40:26.799
BOZER:
Congrats, guys.

40:26.882 --> 40:27.883
After reviewing
Paula's hard drive

40:27.967 --> 40:29.844
and with the promise
of her testimony,

40:29.927 --> 40:31.470
Swiss authorities were
able to issue a warrant

40:31.554 --> 40:33.013
for Salazar's arrest.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.348
MATTY:
And the Zurich Grand was

40:34.431 --> 40:35.975
all too happy to turn him over,

40:36.058 --> 40:38.310
given he was persona non grata

40:38.394 --> 40:39.895
after he broke
every house rule.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.772
TAYLOR:
Yeah, I'm a
bit curious

40:41.856 --> 40:44.775
as to what happened
to our-our friend Vincent.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.152
MATTY:
After you escaped,

40:46.235 --> 40:48.028
Egor turned on Vincent.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.197
He was furious with Vincent
for bringing the Phoenix

40:50.281 --> 40:52.533
into the hotel and refused
to help him disappear.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.993
MacGYVER:
How do we know all that?

40:54.076 --> 40:57.746
Because Vincent left and ran
straight to the authorities.

40:57.830 --> 40:58.706
(laughs)

40:57.830 --> 40:58.706
MATTY:
I guess jail time

40:58.789 --> 41:00.207
was a better prospect

41:00.291 --> 41:02.293
than facing
Vincent Senior's wrath.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.211
Right.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.422
So where are
Riley and Desi?

41:06.505 --> 41:09.216
Oh. I've given them the Phoenix
jet for a special assignment.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.551
Hang on.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.219
(laughs softly)

41:12.303 --> 41:15.264
I... I own that jet.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.057
Right. Bye-bye.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.226
Yes, Matilda,
you don't seem to understand.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.604
Listen, I don't know how many
times I have to say this.

41:21.687 --> 41:24.940
I literally own the--
this op-- Matilda?

41:25.024 --> 41:26.400
