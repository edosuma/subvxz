00:01.767 --> 00:03.564
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis :</i>

00:03.727 --> 00:05.718
<i>Gonna need a name.
How does mike sound ?</i>

00:06.807 --> 00:08.843
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.

00:09.047 --> 00:13.996
<i>- l’m returning to what l am.
- Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.</i>

00:14.207 --> 00:16.596
He’s taken the knowledge
that Atlantis still exists.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.156
We’ve detected a hive ship heading
towards Atlantis.

00:19.327 --> 00:21.158
l think we can assume it’s Michael.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.961
Your retrovirus will allow us
to feed off enemy Wraith.

00:25.727 --> 00:27.797
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly ?

00:28.007 --> 00:30.726
Everything you’ve wanted to know
about Wraith technology.

00:30.927 --> 00:34.556
Once we get in range, we beam
a canister into the CO2 chamber and :

00:34.767 --> 00:36.325
One hive ship de-Wraithified.

00:36.527 --> 00:39.041
There’s been a change in plans.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.364
Two hive ships on our position.
One of them is the friendly.

00:42.527 --> 00:45.405
The queen wants you to witness
the fruits of your labor.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.286
Within the ship’s schematics
was a worm-like computer virus.

00:48.447 --> 00:49.436
What did they get ?

00:49.607 --> 00:51.882
The location of every world
in our database.

00:59.207 --> 01:02.119
With 302s, we might take out
the hyperdrive, save us some time.

01:02.287 --> 01:03.481
Do it.

01:04.607 --> 01:05.881
Shields are at 60 percent.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.919
<i>- I’ve got incoming.
- Daggers 3 and 4...</i>

01:13.087 --> 01:16.079
- ... try to keep these Darts off our six.
- Roger that.

01:33.207 --> 01:35.243
Half the bogeys are pursuing
Daggers 3 and 4.

01:35.407 --> 01:38.046
We got the other half hot on our tail.

01:39.487 --> 01:41.523
l’m taking fire. l’ve lost a generator.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.003
Stand by to break left on my mark.

01:44.167 --> 01:45.725
Mark.

01:48.287 --> 01:49.436
Fox 4.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.998
We’re in the clear. Continue to target.

02:04.847 --> 02:06.246
Shields are under 20 percent.

02:06.447 --> 02:09.519
Get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here.

02:09.687 --> 02:12.645
<i>Two minutes and I can shut down
their hyperdrives.</i>

02:12.847 --> 02:15.919
Unless you can shut down their weapons
it’s not gonna do much good.

02:17.007 --> 02:18.235
Damn it.

02:18.407 --> 02:21.479
Dagger 2, l could use some cover
on my attack run of the target.

02:21.647 --> 02:24.081
<i>Roger that, leader. I’m on my way.</i>

02:32.087 --> 02:34.123
The Darts are returning to the hives.

02:34.327 --> 02:35.760
Can you go to max thrust ?

02:36.407 --> 02:37.601
Negative.

02:38.087 --> 02:40.885
<i>- Head back to the Daedalus.
- Roger that.</i>

02:41.087 --> 02:43.043
The hives are opening
hyperspace windows.

02:57.687 --> 02:59.598
Why the hell did they do that ?

02:59.767 --> 03:01.997
<i>Three of our 302s are returning
to Daedalus, sir.</i>

03:02.167 --> 03:04.158
- Sheppard ?
- His fighter isn’t one of them.

03:04.367 --> 03:07.484
The only contacts l have on-screen
are wreckage.

03:08.007 --> 03:10.840
- What about his locator beacon ?
- Nothing, sir.

03:11.847 --> 03:12.836
He’s just gone.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.125
Understood.

03:32.087 --> 03:36.205
Okay, this is new.

04:55.607 --> 04:58.758
Colonel Caldwell,
what’s the status of the repairs ?

04:59.527 --> 05:01.085
Ongoing.

05:01.247 --> 05:03.556
We lost a few key personnel
in the attack.

05:05.687 --> 05:06.756
Yes, we did.

05:08.327 --> 05:09.999
l’m sorry.

05:10.647 --> 05:14.242
So am l, but this isn’t the time
to mourn them.

05:14.407 --> 05:18.241
l’ve just briefed General Landry. We’re to
check in and advise him of our response.

05:18.407 --> 05:21.843
l’ve got a broken ship and casualties.
l don’t know what you have in mind--

05:22.007 --> 05:24.567
- l want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me ?

05:24.727 --> 05:27.560
As long as they’re still
in striking distance we have to try.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.883
You know we can’t intercept them
in hyperspace.

05:30.047 --> 05:32.277
- Radek ?
- Well, obviously they’ve upgraded...

05:32.487 --> 05:35.206
... their FTL drives using the information
from our database.

05:35.367 --> 05:36.800
<i>- The Aurora mission.
- Obviously.</i>

05:36.967 --> 05:39.322
However, their ships are organic
in nature.

05:39.487 --> 05:42.843
They will need to make brief pauses
to recover from hyperspace radiation.

05:43.047 --> 05:46.005
- Where and when ?
- It will take some time to calculate.

05:46.567 --> 05:48.922
- Go.
- Okay.

05:51.407 --> 05:54.285
Dr. Weir, l wanna go after
these bastards as much as you do...

05:54.447 --> 05:57.041
<i>... but the Daedalus is in no position
to fight right now.</i>

05:57.487 --> 06:00.126
Our shields are depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.

06:00.327 --> 06:03.205
Even if we could catch up,
l don’t know how long we’d last.

06:03.407 --> 06:05.477
<i>Which is why l’m committing
the Orion as well.</i>

06:05.647 --> 06:08.036
It was recalled the moment
the virus was revealed.

06:08.247 --> 06:10.920
<i>- It’s in no better shape than Daedalus.
- It will fly.</i>

06:11.087 --> 06:14.443
And by the time you reach the hive ships
it should also be able to fight.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.996
- And if it isn’t ?
- Currently, Stargate Command...

06:17.167 --> 06:22.002
... has no vessels capable of engaging
the hive ships before they reach Earth.

06:23.647 --> 06:26.684
They cannot be allowed
to get that far, Steven.

06:31.527 --> 06:33.802
You know what
you’re asking me to do ?

06:34.247 --> 06:36.203
l do.

06:41.887 --> 06:43.798
There’s still repairs
that need to be made.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.046
Do what you have to do.

07:09.687 --> 07:11.405
They couldn’t have.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.398
If they deduced
the location of Earth...

07:13.567 --> 07:16.001
... they wouldn’t be able to get there,
unless they...

07:17.287 --> 07:20.006
They downloaded something
along with the hive-ship plans.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.202
Something like spyware.

07:21.367 --> 07:23.597
It’s like when l stupidly
downloaded por--

07:23.767 --> 07:25.837
Music, when l downloaded music.

07:28.327 --> 07:29.965
l asked them to do it.

07:30.127 --> 07:33.119
l did this. l’m responsible
for the destruction of my own planet.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.084
Anybody was gonna do it,
it’d be you.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.203
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for that.

07:37.367 --> 07:38.800
Stop worrying now. Just focus.

07:38.967 --> 07:41.720
On what ? What is there to focus on ?
l’m stuck in a cocoon.

07:41.887 --> 07:43.684
- Getting out of here.
- Right. Of course.

07:43.847 --> 07:46.407
Why didn’t l think of that ?
Of course. Here goes.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.639
Nope, still can’t move.

07:51.327 --> 07:54.160
l’m pretty sure
they’re struggle-proof there, big guy.

08:05.167 --> 08:08.318
Okay, can’t sit here forever.

08:10.927 --> 08:14.363
Hit them while they’re in hyperspace,
they’Il never know what happened.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.956
Is that even possible ?

08:17.167 --> 08:20.159
<i>There’s no reason to believe
their hyperspace field is different...</i>

08:20.327 --> 08:22.318
... and we can’t launch 302s
while in hyperspace.

08:22.487 --> 08:25.718
l’m talking about maneuvering
within the field, not passing through it.

08:25.887 --> 08:27.445
What do you think ?

08:28.647 --> 08:31.764
- Colonel ?
- What ? Yes.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.441
He’s not listening.

08:35.886 --> 08:38.162
l gotta pay more attention
to those guys.

08:54.327 --> 08:56.557
Yes, Michael ?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.482
You should have told me...

09:00.447 --> 09:02.756
... that we were going to betray
the Atlanteans.

09:02.967 --> 09:06.198
- Are you feeling sympathy for them ?
- No.

09:06.407 --> 09:08.796
But l don’t understand
why l wasn’t told.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.840
l told you their plan
because l believe it was a viable way--

09:12.007 --> 09:15.522
You are only alive because
you still may prove to be useful.

09:16.327 --> 09:18.522
But l fear, Michael...

09:18.727 --> 09:22.686
... that the lingering stench
of what they’ve transformed you into...

09:22.847 --> 09:24.997
... will never fade.

09:35.127 --> 09:39.484
<i>In approximately one hour,
the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace...</i>

09:39.647 --> 09:41.239
<i>... here.</i>

09:42.447 --> 09:45.325
<i>It’s just outside
of the Pegasus galaxy.</i>

09:45.767 --> 09:48.918
There they will pause for 15 hours.

09:49.127 --> 09:51.846
<i>If Daedalus and Orion break orbit
on our current schedule...</i>

09:52.007 --> 09:53.679
... they should reach
those coordinates...

09:53.847 --> 09:56.680
... in just under 14 hours,
best possible speed.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.724
<i>Narrow window.</i>

09:58.887 --> 10:00.366
It’s the only window, sir.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.795
Understood.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.958
Now, the International
Oversight Advisory...

10:04.127 --> 10:06.118
... wants you to brief them
on this matter.

10:06.287 --> 10:09.085
<i>- When would you like me to dial again ?
- You misunderstand me.</i>

10:09.247 --> 10:11.442
l mean in person,
and l mean right now.

10:11.607 --> 10:14.917
<i>- The president himself is--
- l can’t just leave. Not now.</i>

10:15.127 --> 10:16.719
l’m afraid that’s not up to you.

10:16.927 --> 10:19.043
<i>- There is far too much going on here.
- Doctor.</i>

10:19.247 --> 10:21.636
You’ve done all
you’re going to do for now.

10:21.807 --> 10:24.367
l need you to step through that gate.

10:24.567 --> 10:26.717
<i>They’re waiting for you
in my briefing room.</i>

10:28.767 --> 10:30.678
Dr. Weir ?

10:33.527 --> 10:35.165
l see.

10:40.127 --> 10:44.917
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams
to return from their missions.

10:45.087 --> 10:48.284
Once that happens, l’d like to suspend
gate travel till this is over.

10:48.447 --> 10:49.846
Of course.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.556
<i>l’Il need you to dial in
once the Daedalus is ready.</i>

10:53.727 --> 10:55.365
l know what to do, Élizabeth.

10:55.527 --> 10:57.085
Of course you do.

10:57.247 --> 11:00.319
- l will see you when you return.
- Thank you.

11:31.687 --> 11:33.166
Welcome back to Earth.

11:33.327 --> 11:35.636
Thank you, general.
It’s wonderful to be here.

11:35.807 --> 11:37.240
l can see that.

11:37.407 --> 11:40.205
You know, l considered
disobeying your order.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.483
There wouldn’t have been too much
you could do.

11:42.647 --> 11:44.797
You made the right decision
in coming.

11:44.967 --> 11:47.527
We’re in the middle of a crisis.
This is absolutely--

11:47.687 --> 11:51.043
Don’t bite my head off, Élizabeth.
The recall order didn’t come from me.

11:51.207 --> 11:52.765
Who it came from doesn’t matter.

11:52.927 --> 11:55.282
What if l told you it came
from the president ?

11:55.447 --> 11:56.766
l wouldn’t believe you.

11:56.927 --> 11:58.758
And you’d be right.

11:59.327 --> 12:03.002
But in a couple of weeks,
there could be aliens on our doorstep...

12:03.167 --> 12:05.840
... determined to feed
on the human race.

12:06.007 --> 12:09.079
The president had no choice
but to accede to the l. O.A.’s demand...

12:09.247 --> 12:11.044
... that you be brought back to explain.

12:15.247 --> 12:16.600
So, what do they really want ?

12:16.807 --> 12:19.605
To point fingers, cover their asses.

12:20.567 --> 12:23.320
l am honestly not sure
how l will respond to that, sir.

12:23.527 --> 12:26.041
They’re bureaucrats, Élizabeth.

12:26.207 --> 12:28.675
You’Il have them for breakfast.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.361
There is work l must attend to.

12:50.447 --> 12:52.677
Stand aside !

12:54.527 --> 12:58.042
Am l to sit quietly in my quarters ?

13:09.607 --> 13:11.723
You know, these are actually
quite comfortable.

13:11.887 --> 13:14.640
Surprisingly warm,
take all the pressure off the spine.

13:14.807 --> 13:17.799
They’re as good a place as any
to witness the end of humanity.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.719
You’re wasting your energy talking.

13:19.887 --> 13:22.606
Okay, let’s say a magic fairy
comes down...

13:22.767 --> 13:25.964
... and grants you one wish,
and we break out ? Then what, huh ?

13:26.167 --> 13:28.362
We’re in a hive,
traveling through hyperspace...

13:28.527 --> 13:31.246
... probably in the massive void
between our two galaxies...

13:31.407 --> 13:34.717
... where there aren’t even planets,
let alone stargates. What then, huh ?

13:34.927 --> 13:36.724
We fly home on the wings
of imagination ?

13:36.887 --> 13:39.447
- Is that what we do, Ronon ?
- You can sit here and die...

13:39.607 --> 13:40.835
... but l’m not giving up.

13:41.047 --> 13:44.005
- Oh, fine. l will.
- Fine !

13:50.567 --> 13:54.082
Okay, time to do some damage.

13:57.607 --> 13:59.677
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me ?

14:01.007 --> 14:05.956
<i>Rodney ? I know this is a long shot,
but if you can hear me, please respond.</i>

14:10.087 --> 14:12.157
<i>If you’re near a radio,
I need you to come in.</i>

14:12.327 --> 14:15.637
<i>I need to know your location.
Guys ?</i>

14:15.807 --> 14:17.286
Colonel Sheppard.

14:18.287 --> 14:20.357
<i>- Is that you ?
- Who’s this ?</i>

14:20.567 --> 14:25.357
- You know me as Michael.
- Sorry, got the wrong number.

14:25.527 --> 14:28.360
<i>Ronon and Dr. mcKay are still alive.</i>

14:29.447 --> 14:33.440
- What are you gonna do with them ?
- If you want them to live, listen to me.

14:38.247 --> 14:42.160
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to
disable these ships for them to reach us.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.801
If you really wanna help,
why don’t you just do that ?

14:45.007 --> 14:48.317
- They would know.
- Aren’t you « they« ou » ??

14:48.527 --> 14:51.325
Please believe me when l say
l was as deceived as you were.

14:51.527 --> 14:53.643
Oh, l don’t know.
l was pretty deceived.

14:53.807 --> 14:56.037
<i>It seems that because of what
you did to me...</i>

14:56.687 --> 14:59.679
... the Wraith no longer see me
as one of their own.

15:00.087 --> 15:03.602
That’s why you wanna help,
because you don’t feel welcome.

15:03.807 --> 15:06.958
<i>- We don’t have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do. I’ve got...</i>

15:07.167 --> 15:08.805
... a good three hours of air left.

15:10.927 --> 15:13.680
- Where are you ?
- Wouldn’t you like to know ?

15:13.887 --> 15:17.402
l need to know what level you’re on
so l can guide you from there.

15:17.567 --> 15:20.161
<i>You mean trust you ?</i>

15:20.847 --> 15:22.439
Are you in a position not to ?

15:24.887 --> 15:26.843
l’ve got you right where l want you.

15:27.007 --> 15:29.567
<i>I doubt I will be allowed to live
much longer...</i>

15:29.767 --> 15:32.759
... and yet l very much
want to continue living.

15:33.007 --> 15:35.043
If you want to survive as l do...

15:35.207 --> 15:37.357
... then l suggest you tell me
where you are.

15:38.647 --> 15:43.562
l’m outside the hive in a 302
about to blast your ship.

15:44.047 --> 15:45.685
<i>You still wanna help ?</i>

15:45.847 --> 15:48.486
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive
would be most effective.

15:48.687 --> 15:51.520
Yeah, that’s what l was thinking.

15:51.687 --> 15:55.123
<i>Then I suggest you act now
before you are discovered.</i>

15:57.927 --> 15:59.997
The leader of the hive
presented a scenario...

16:00.167 --> 16:03.557
... which made it seem
we were under a time constraint.

16:03.727 --> 16:06.525
To speed up the problem solving,
we distributed the file.

16:06.687 --> 16:09.679
And played right into their hands.

16:10.607 --> 16:11.960
Yes.

16:12.127 --> 16:16.757
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed
of every action they took along the way.

16:16.927 --> 16:19.441
And we supported
her recommendations, l know.

16:19.607 --> 16:23.361
But clearly, we were not in possession
of all of the facts.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.320
Obviously, neither were we,
ambassador.

16:28.647 --> 16:32.003
What measures have you taken to
prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth ?

16:32.167 --> 16:34.761
l was coordinating a strike
when you recalled me.

16:34.967 --> 16:36.366
With what ?

16:36.887 --> 16:40.084
- With everything we’ve got.
- Is that wise ?

16:42.487 --> 16:44.000
General Landry has informed me...

16:44.167 --> 16:47.637
... that in light of fleet resources
committed to fighting the Ori...

16:47.847 --> 16:49.758
... the weapons platform
in Antarctica...

16:49.927 --> 16:54.000
... powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators
would be Earth’s only defense.

16:55.047 --> 16:59.359
l believe it would be better to stop them
while they’re within reach of Atlantis.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.285
Wouldn’t it have been more prudent...

17:01.447 --> 17:03.915
<i>... to send the ZPM back to Earth
on the Daedalus...</i>

17:04.087 --> 17:05.679
... ensuring successful operation...

17:05.847 --> 17:08.281
... of the weapons platform
when the Wraith arrive ?

17:08.487 --> 17:11.319
<i>The Daedalus suffered severe damage
during the first battle.</i>

17:11.527 --> 17:13.961
A long journey at full power
was out of the question.

17:15.807 --> 17:19.117
There is no way of knowing how much
faster the Wraith ships have become.

17:19.287 --> 17:21.755
You’d risk the lives
of everyone aboard those ships...

17:21.967 --> 17:23.605
... in order to undo your mistake ?

17:28.687 --> 17:32.316
<i>Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis,
performing emergency repairs.</i>

17:32.487 --> 17:34.876
There is still time to beam
the ZPM aboard.

17:35.527 --> 17:39.645
<i>But either plan will require Daedalus
to break orbit within the next hour.</i>

17:40.087 --> 17:44.126
Then if you’Il excuse us, we need
some time to discuss our options.

17:44.687 --> 17:46.882
l have instructed Atlantis
to contact the SGC...

17:47.047 --> 17:49.641
<i>... when both Daedalus and Orion
are ready to leave.</i>

17:49.807 --> 17:52.924
If you’d like to overturn my
standing orders at that time, go ahead.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.767
But you will have to fire me first.

18:05.807 --> 18:08.480
Wonder what they’Il do to us.
Feed on us probably.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.399
l mean, that’s...
That’s what they do.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.205
It’s not gonna come to that.

18:12.367 --> 18:13.880
Maybe.

18:14.047 --> 18:16.481
Earth will probably mount
some kind of defense.

18:17.127 --> 18:19.357
In which case,
death would be instantaneous.

18:20.487 --> 18:23.240
Unless we’re trapped on a deck
with a fire or something.

18:23.407 --> 18:25.602
Then we’d be burned alive.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.645
Well, burned alive or suffocate.

18:29.687 --> 18:31.086
l wonder which would be worse :

18:31.247 --> 18:33.477
Being life-sucked by the Wraith,
or burned alive.

18:33.647 --> 18:35.399
l couldn’t consider two worse options.

18:35.567 --> 18:38.877
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what ? Make me.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.725
What are you doing ?

18:46.447 --> 18:47.596
Where did you get that ?

18:51.887 --> 18:54.196
l was trying to get my hand free
so l could get it.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.959
Would it have killed you
to tell me ?

19:00.767 --> 19:03.725
Maybe l would have if you’d shut up
for more than a minute.

19:03.887 --> 19:05.798
What ? Don’t just stand there.
Cut me loose.

19:06.807 --> 19:10.277
Only if you put an end to all this
« we’re gonna die, there’s no hope « talk.

19:10.447 --> 19:11.482
Well, now there’s hope.

19:14.047 --> 19:15.719
Get ready.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.597
A little help with this ?

19:29.207 --> 19:31.801
- It’s freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in ?

19:31.967 --> 19:34.640
- No.
- So now what ?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.320
- What ?
- How do we get out of here ?

19:36.487 --> 19:38.876
- Well, l don’t--
- What ?

19:39.047 --> 19:41.003
- You said no more death talk.
- Okay.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.759
We’re out of the cocoons. So what ?

19:42.927 --> 19:45.043
We’re still on the ship.
There’s no way off it.

19:45.207 --> 19:47.767
- Well, any survivable way.
- You’Il think of something.

19:47.927 --> 19:50.725
- It’s not a question of thinking.
- You’Il think of something.

19:50.887 --> 19:52.684
Fine. Can we at least
go somewhere else ?

19:52.847 --> 19:56.078
Can you get this off me ?
It’s down my back. It’s down my back.

19:56.247 --> 19:57.805
Just...

20:05.767 --> 20:07.564
So, what do they wanna do ?

20:07.727 --> 20:09.797
They’re still arguing about it.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.435
- Of course they are.
- Incoming wormhole.

20:17.087 --> 20:20.204
<i>This is Atlantis. We have
a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.</i>

20:20.367 --> 20:21.959
Stand by, Atlantis.

20:22.127 --> 20:24.083
They haven’t reached a decision.

20:24.287 --> 20:26.198
And they don’t want to, Mr. Woolsey.

20:26.407 --> 20:30.002
If they agree or disagree with me, then
they have to take some responsibility.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.120
They’d rather have someone to blame.
l give this order...

20:34.287 --> 20:36.278
... either way, they have a scapegoat.

20:36.447 --> 20:38.961
It’s all part of the game.

20:39.527 --> 20:40.562
Ma’am ?

20:45.167 --> 20:46.600
Teyla.

20:46.807 --> 20:47.922
Yes, Élizabeth.

20:48.087 --> 20:51.796
<i>Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed
with the mission as planned...</i>

20:53.287 --> 20:56.518
<i>- ... and Godspeed.
- I will tell him.</i>

21:01.807 --> 21:03.286
Hermiod, what’s our status ?

21:03.487 --> 21:06.524
Shields are at full strength.
l’ve rerouted nonessential power...

21:06.727 --> 21:09.241
<i>... in order to ensure power levels
for a longer period.</i>

21:09.407 --> 21:12.319
l want all missile tubes loaded
with Mark-lll tactical warheads.

21:12.487 --> 21:14.523
- That would be every one.
- l’m aware of that.

21:14.687 --> 21:17.724
Disable all firing safeties
to launch every one of our missiles...

21:17.887 --> 21:20.879
- ... the moment we exit hyperspace.
- l’m not sure that’s possible.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.924
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.764
<i>major Lorne, we’re approaching
our T-zero.</i>

21:27.327 --> 21:30.956
Zelenka says she’Il fly, sir, but as of
right now that’s about all she can do.

21:31.167 --> 21:33.886
You’Il have 13 hours to get
your weapons and shields online.

21:34.047 --> 21:37.039
We need to leave now to make
this window. Are you go or no-go ?

21:37.247 --> 21:38.726
We’re a go, sir.

21:38.927 --> 21:40.076
Very well. On my mark :

21:40.247 --> 21:43.205
Three, two, one, mark.

21:51.807 --> 21:55.163
You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere
near the area l’m about to light up ?

21:56.367 --> 21:58.039
l’m certain.

21:58.367 --> 21:59.516
Good luck.

21:59.727 --> 22:02.560
Thanks. It’Il be a walk in the park.

22:02.727 --> 22:04.922
A very scary park...

22:05.087 --> 22:08.636
... filled with monsters
who are trying to kill me.

22:08.807 --> 22:11.924
<i>- I don’t understand.
- Never mind.</i>

22:19.407 --> 22:22.285
Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly
is a go.

22:39.607 --> 22:41.040
<i>Target is destroyed.</i>

22:41.207 --> 22:44.802
Disable the second hive quickly.
Their fighters will be headed your way.

22:52.727 --> 22:54.638
How about this help
you were talking about ?

22:54.807 --> 22:58.004
<i>- I told you, target the hyperdrive.
- l already knew that.</i>

22:58.207 --> 23:01.438
- There’s nothing l can do.
- Like hell there isn’t. Call off the Darts.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.558
They won’t listen to me.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.327
This is not helpful, Michael.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.639
Dr. Weir ?

23:27.887 --> 23:29.684
What can l do for you, Mr. Woolsey ?

23:29.847 --> 23:31.644
The ambassadors
have finished convening.

23:31.807 --> 23:32.922
Oh, good timing.

23:33.087 --> 23:36.079
Yes. They’d like to continue
debriefing you now.

23:36.247 --> 23:39.523
- Yeah, l bet they would.
- Excuse me ?

23:39.687 --> 23:42.997
No. l’m not gonna sit there
and have them rake me over the coals...

23:43.167 --> 23:46.876
... about every decision l’ve made
that they don’t agree with in hindsight.

23:47.047 --> 23:50.562
l have the greatest respect for you
but as far as the l. O.A. is concerned...

23:50.727 --> 23:52.922
... you’re not exactly
the employee of the month.

23:53.087 --> 23:57.399
If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping
my job will be the least of my concerns.

23:57.567 --> 24:02.436
- And if your plan succeeds ?
- Then l expect to keep my job, yes.

24:02.847 --> 24:06.886
Because l did what they apparently are
incapable of doing. l made a decision.

24:07.807 --> 24:10.196
The fact is, at this point,
there is nothing more...

24:10.367 --> 24:12.642
... we can do but wait and see
what happens.

24:13.367 --> 24:15.244
But give them my best.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.642
We have been walking around here for
a day and l haven’t seen one exit sign.

24:44.807 --> 24:46.798
Sooner or later,
l’Il have to eat something.

24:46.967 --> 24:49.356
- l think l have a plan.
- You ? Really ?

24:49.527 --> 24:51.961
- You know a lot about these ships, right ?
- Maybe. Why ?

24:52.127 --> 24:54.561
If l get you to a panel,
how much damage could you do ?

24:54.727 --> 24:56.843
- What ?
- Overload the engines and blow the ship ?

24:57.007 --> 24:59.282
- How is that an escape plan ?
- l never said it was.

24:59.447 --> 25:01.278
- That’s a plan ?
- You said there’s no way out.

25:01.447 --> 25:04.644
- If we’re dead, let’s take them with us.
- l’d rather die a hero than a meal.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.320
- You can do it ?
- Yeah, probably.

25:06.527 --> 25:07.676
Now you’re talking.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.797
You should not be here.

25:17.527 --> 25:19.324
She asked me to question
the prisoner.

25:22.327 --> 25:25.160
If you’d prefer
to discuss it with her...

25:27.487 --> 25:28.920
Release him.

25:31.167 --> 25:32.725
l will take him from here.

25:42.487 --> 25:43.602
You had me worried there.

25:43.767 --> 25:46.918
You’ve slowed them down,
at least for a little while.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.476
We need to get to a ship,
hope your friends find us.

25:49.647 --> 25:51.399
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.

25:51.567 --> 25:53.717
We’re headed toward them now.

25:54.167 --> 25:56.886
Now, that’s what l call help.

25:59.527 --> 26:01.324
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.916
Launch the moment
the target’s acquired. Don’t wait.

26:04.087 --> 26:06.555
Five, four, three--

26:17.167 --> 26:18.759
- Missiles are away.
- Dart activity ?

26:18.927 --> 26:21.919
Quite a number of them.
They’re moving to intercept our missiles.

26:22.407 --> 26:24.204
<i>Now would be a good time, Orion.</i>

26:36.927 --> 26:38.485
What the hell ?

26:40.807 --> 26:42.638
One of your ships
has launched an attack.

26:42.807 --> 26:44.718
Their strike inflicted damage
on this hive.

26:44.887 --> 26:45.876
Good.

26:46.047 --> 26:48.766
The other was undamaged.
Your vessel’s continuing to engage.

26:48.927 --> 26:51.839
Are you gonna go through
the play-by-play or get out of here ?

26:52.407 --> 26:53.886
This way.

27:01.007 --> 27:02.645
- Ship’s engaged in battle.
- With who ?

27:02.807 --> 27:04.240
- Doesn’t matter.
- Matters to us.

27:04.407 --> 27:05.522
- Why ?
- If it’s our guys...

27:05.687 --> 27:07.917
... our chance went back above zero,
fractionally.

27:08.087 --> 27:11.796
If it’s our guys, all the more reason to
damage this ship and help them. Move it.

27:12.007 --> 27:13.326
One missile got through, sir.

27:13.487 --> 27:16.206
One of the Wraith ships suffered damage
but the other one--

27:16.367 --> 27:18.927
<i>The Orion has arrived.
The hive is moving to intercept.</i>

27:19.087 --> 27:21.123
- They launched their weapons ?
- Negative, sir.

27:21.287 --> 27:22.800
Open a secure channel.

27:25.127 --> 27:27.482
<i>major Lorne, now would be a good time
to open fire.</i>

27:27.687 --> 27:29.040
Yes, l was thinking the same.

27:29.207 --> 27:31.402
l gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka ?

27:31.567 --> 27:32.841
l’m trying !

27:33.047 --> 27:36.244
We’re having difficulty transferring
power from shields to weapons.

27:36.447 --> 27:39.245
<i>- There’s a hive bearing on your position.
- Yes, sir. I see.</i>

27:39.447 --> 27:42.041
- Stand by. Doc, you’re killing us.
- Okay. l have it.

27:42.207 --> 27:43.401
Firing drones.

28:05.687 --> 28:08.076
<i>The remaining hive
is shifting their attack to Orion.</i>

28:08.247 --> 28:09.362
Move to intercept.

28:09.527 --> 28:13.076
<i>Orion has no shields. We’re not gonna
make it there in time, sir.</i>

28:26.087 --> 28:27.361
Where are they ?

28:27.527 --> 28:30.200
l’m sorry. They must have
been taken for feeding.

28:30.367 --> 28:33.882
No, no. These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.607
They could be anywhere on this ship.

28:36.767 --> 28:38.120
Well, that’s a start.

28:38.287 --> 28:40.960
Why ? What could their objective
possibly be ?

28:41.127 --> 28:43.846
If l know Ronon, they’re somewhere
they can do much damage.

28:44.007 --> 28:46.885
And McKay would know where
and how to do that, so...

28:47.207 --> 28:49.721
There’s a control station this way.

28:57.127 --> 28:58.845
One more shot, that’s all l’m asking.

28:59.007 --> 29:01.601
l just cannot give you
what l don’t have.

29:03.887 --> 29:06.606
There’s too much damage.
We need to abandon ship.

29:06.767 --> 29:09.201
- Listen to me.
- We sacrificed our shield capability...

29:09.367 --> 29:12.962
... for that first salvo. This ship
is going to blow any moment, major.

29:15.207 --> 29:18.165
Caldwell, l’m afraid we’ve done
everything we can on our end.

29:18.327 --> 29:20.238
<i>Request immediate beam out
to Daedalus.</i>

29:21.447 --> 29:23.517
Get them over here.

29:29.807 --> 29:32.116
Their operating system is a mess.

29:32.287 --> 29:34.755
Thank goodness l remember DOS.

29:35.727 --> 29:38.685
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet ?

29:38.847 --> 29:41.407
Look, this ship has been
seriously damaged.

29:41.567 --> 29:43.683
It’s hard for me to find something
to overload.

29:43.847 --> 29:45.246
Let Mikey try.

29:48.887 --> 29:51.003
- He’s helping us.
- Where did you come from ?

29:51.167 --> 29:54.045
l latched onto the hull
before it went into hyperspace.

29:54.247 --> 29:57.319
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.

29:58.287 --> 30:00.676
<i>- We gotta get to the Daedalus.
- The Daedalus is here ?</i>

30:00.847 --> 30:03.645
- We need to get to the transport.
- Why should l trust you ?

30:06.527 --> 30:08.995
Because l’m trusting you.

30:15.607 --> 30:18.246
Because l said so.

30:30.367 --> 30:32.323
- l don’t like this.
- You got a better idea ?

30:32.487 --> 30:34.603
We take the ship on our own
and leave him here.

30:34.767 --> 30:36.280
He’s the reason l’m alive now.

30:36.447 --> 30:39.757
l don’t think that’s possible. It took
days to crack the Dart interface.

30:39.927 --> 30:41.679
- This ship is bigger.
- l don’t like it.

30:41.847 --> 30:45.476
- Yeah, l get it. You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.

30:46.647 --> 30:48.285
Is there anything to boost a signal ?

30:48.447 --> 30:50.563
<i>l wanna reach the Daedalus
as soon as possible.</i>

30:50.727 --> 30:52.365
- Well, l could try.
- Hang on.

30:52.527 --> 30:55.041
They’Il open fire on us
the second we leave the bay.

30:55.207 --> 30:58.404
Oh, great. The day just gets
better and better.

31:09.967 --> 31:12.527
- Sorry, sir. We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.

31:12.687 --> 31:15.406
Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays.
Hold fire till l order.

31:15.567 --> 31:18.684
Channel every ounce of power
to the forward shield until then.

31:18.887 --> 31:21.606
l have a contact.
Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.

31:21.767 --> 31:23.883
Just left the hive
and is on a course for us.

31:24.087 --> 31:26.999
- It’s broadcasting on our frequencies.
- What do they want ?

31:27.207 --> 31:29.960
- Maybe they want to surrender ?
- Not likely. Let’s hear it.

31:30.127 --> 31:33.278
<i>This is Sheppard, authentication code
Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three.</i>

31:33.447 --> 31:34.562
<i>Please respond.</i>

31:34.727 --> 31:35.716
Open a channel.

31:38.047 --> 31:39.799
Colonel Sheppard,
we’d written you off.

31:39.967 --> 31:41.559
<i>Don’t get all emotional on me now.</i>

31:41.727 --> 31:44.685
<i>I’ve got mcKay, Ronon and michael
aboard a Wraith transport.</i>

31:44.887 --> 31:46.002
<i>- Michael ?
- Yes, sir.</i>

31:46.167 --> 31:47.566
<i>He’s got a plan you’Il like.</i>

31:48.047 --> 31:50.481
<i>It won’t be long before they start
shooting at us.</i>

31:50.647 --> 31:54.037
- The hive opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.

31:56.807 --> 31:59.037
- Colonel.
- You said something about a plan ?

31:59.207 --> 32:02.722
l’ve disabled their jamming code.
It’s a matter of time before they realize.

32:02.927 --> 32:05.964
- All you have to do is send a nuke.
- We deployed all our warheads.

32:06.127 --> 32:09.244
- The hive is launching Darts.
- Open up on those bays, all batteries.

32:33.047 --> 32:34.036
Shut that off !

32:41.807 --> 32:43.877
- Report.
- The plan worked, sir.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.965
The concentrated fire on the bays
created secondary explosions.

32:47.127 --> 32:49.357
- They’ve stopped firing.
- Nice work, colonel.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.523
A draw is a win for our side.
Ship status ?

32:52.087 --> 32:54.647
Shields completely depleted.
We’re venting atmosphere.

32:55.287 --> 32:56.800
Seal off all affected decks.

32:56.967 --> 33:00.164
That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren’t responding.

33:00.327 --> 33:01.919
Right now, we’re shallow-breathing.

33:02.407 --> 33:05.080
- Meaning ?
- Meaning that in under nine hours...

33:05.247 --> 33:07.522
... we’re all gonna suffocate.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.635
As long as we don’t worry
about shields and weapons...

33:19.807 --> 33:22.526
... we may be able to cannibalize parts
from other systems...

33:22.687 --> 33:25.076
... in order to create
a CO2 filtration system.

33:25.247 --> 33:27.078
By the time we got that
up and running...

33:27.247 --> 33:30.557
... the CO2 levels will overwhelm
any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.

33:30.727 --> 33:32.797
- But it’s worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless...

33:32.967 --> 33:36.562
... we need more electricians and welders
than are certified on this ship.

33:36.727 --> 33:39.605
Anyone, and l mean anyone,
who took shop needs to report to us.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.962
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.

33:42.127 --> 33:45.278
Now we’re talking. How many more
of these do we have ?

33:45.447 --> 33:47.358
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard ?

33:47.527 --> 33:48.755
In and around the 200 mark.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.441
Buddy-breathing our way through
is out of the question.

33:51.607 --> 33:53.404
- l’m afraid so, sir. Yes.
- Okay, fine.

33:53.607 --> 33:55.518
They’re for people
working on life support.

33:55.687 --> 33:58.281
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By « those people« ou » ?-- ?

33:58.447 --> 34:00.438
- l’Il be one.
- How many levels inaccessible ?

34:00.607 --> 34:02.006
- Seven.
- We need to find out...

34:02.167 --> 34:05.239
... if there’s pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour...

34:05.407 --> 34:08.284
- ... from the regions sealed off.
- We can’t transfer the O2...

34:08.447 --> 34:09.800
- ... where we need.
- We could--

34:09.967 --> 34:12.958
We’Il be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.

34:13.127 --> 34:15.925
He can eyeball it from the outside.
l’Il take this.

34:23.367 --> 34:25.880
These sections are completely open
to space, Rodney.

34:26.047 --> 34:28.481
There aren’t even pockets
you could beam into.

34:28.647 --> 34:30.284
What about an EVA ?

34:30.927 --> 34:33.121
Space suits were stored
in those sections.

34:33.286 --> 34:36.677
<i>- All right, I’m heading back.
- Copy that.</i>

34:36.847 --> 34:38.757
Have you tried routing
from the inertial-- ?

34:38.927 --> 34:41.440
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.

34:41.607 --> 34:42.722
Subspace communications ?

34:42.887 --> 34:46.038
We are floating
between two galaxies, Radek.

34:46.206 --> 34:47.799
Atlantis has no ship to send.

34:47.967 --> 34:51.562
Even if we were able to repair the array
and get a message back to Earth...

34:51.766 --> 34:54.360
... it would still take them weeks
to get a rescue here.

34:54.567 --> 34:56.284
l wasn’t thinking of rescue.

34:56.447 --> 34:59.325
l was thinking of telling them
that we’ve stopped the Wraith.

34:59.487 --> 35:01.557
Letting someone know
the sacrifice we’ve done.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.440
Well, a noble sentiment,
but l would prefer to dedicate...

35:04.607 --> 35:08.077
... my last breath of air
to getting more air.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.164
Wait a second.

35:11.367 --> 35:13.835
The only air within light years
is on the Wraith ship.

35:14.007 --> 35:17.124
There’s also Wraith aboard
that Wraith ship, doctor.

35:17.287 --> 35:20.006
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.080
You would be far outnumbered.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.482
Well, we’re dead here.
l’Il take my chances.

35:25.807 --> 35:30.437
l admire your courage, colonel, but you
would be dead there as surely as here.

35:34.207 --> 35:36.118
Unless we send over the gas.

35:37.967 --> 35:40.242
Yes, yes, yes. That could work.

35:40.447 --> 35:43.280
The retrovirus gas would make them
virtually harmless.

35:43.487 --> 35:46.604
- Do we still have it onboard ?
- Yes, we do.

35:46.967 --> 35:48.878
Michael’s disabled
their jamming codes--

35:49.087 --> 35:52.318
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.916
We wait long enough,
they won’t wanna put up a fight.

35:55.087 --> 35:58.238
They’Il be humans with no memories.
l might actually survive this.

35:58.407 --> 36:02.320
We’re almost out of air. The retrovirus
takes 10 hours to run its course.

36:02.527 --> 36:05.360
Yeah, well, we’Il rotate the crew
in and out of the 302s.

36:07.927 --> 36:09.758
If this works,
can you fly the hive ship ?

36:11.687 --> 36:13.245
l could.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.156
What do you say, colonel ?

36:17.607 --> 36:20.440
Weaps, get us within beaming range
of the hive.

36:20.847 --> 36:22.565
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

36:30.127 --> 36:32.004
- Anything ?
- No.

36:32.207 --> 36:34.084
No contacts yet.

36:34.247 --> 36:38.684
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator
and the chair in Antarctica are promising.

36:38.847 --> 36:41.441
« Promising. » That doesn’t sound
very promising.

36:41.607 --> 36:45.316
We’re fairly confident the Ancient
weapon will take care of the hive ships...

36:45.487 --> 36:48.479
... but doing so will probably require
the last of our drones...

36:48.647 --> 36:51.207
... and there goes our secret weapon.

36:51.367 --> 36:54.165
We’d really rather not have to do that.

36:55.287 --> 36:57.323
How’d it go with the l. O. A ?

36:57.487 --> 36:58.476
Oh, you know.

36:58.647 --> 37:02.322
l mean, does anyone ever come out
of an l. O.A. deposition saying :

37:02.487 --> 37:03.476
« That went well« ou » ??

37:03.647 --> 37:05.683
No, l don’t suppose they do.

37:06.567 --> 37:08.125
It was what it was.

37:08.327 --> 37:11.558
At least most of the time
you’re a galaxy away.

37:11.727 --> 37:15.436
That Woolsey guy is here
almost every other week.

37:19.167 --> 37:21.397
l think they’re gonna ask me
to step down.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.644
Well, if they’re just gonna ask,
you can always say no.

37:28.087 --> 37:30.043
l messed this one up, general.

37:30.767 --> 37:32.325
Yeah, you did.

37:33.567 --> 37:35.159
l lost some of the best people--

37:35.327 --> 37:37.443
You proceeded with the blessing
of the l. O.A.

37:37.927 --> 37:40.680
And Stargate Command, as l recall.

37:40.847 --> 37:42.644
Somehow, that doesn’t seem
to help much.

37:42.847 --> 37:45.077
Success is not final.

37:45.247 --> 37:47.556
Failure is not fatal.

37:47.727 --> 37:51.720
It’s the courage to continue
that counts.

37:52.087 --> 37:54.555
And l think you’ve got that in spades.

37:56.927 --> 37:59.521
- Churchill ?
- Yeah.

37:59.687 --> 38:02.281
Except for that last part about you.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.597
That was all me.

38:07.247 --> 38:10.205
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.

38:45.927 --> 38:49.397
Our CO2 levels
are getting dangerous, sir.

38:50.087 --> 38:52.999
The gas has barely had a chance
to run its course.

38:53.167 --> 38:55.681
We don’t have much of a choice.

38:55.847 --> 38:57.758
We gotta go now.

39:32.807 --> 39:33.956
Some of them are dead.

39:35.887 --> 39:38.355
Looks like they killed each other.

39:39.447 --> 39:41.119
What’s happened ?

39:44.287 --> 39:45.640
All right.

39:45.807 --> 39:47.001
It’s all right.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.682
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.

39:51.447 --> 39:53.756
The queen’s chamber
should be that way.

40:12.767 --> 40:14.359
Hello ?

40:18.367 --> 40:19.925
You all right ?

40:20.967 --> 40:23.276
It’s okay.
You’re gonna be all right now.

40:38.847 --> 40:39.996
Didn’t work on her.

40:41.527 --> 40:43.757
Beckett wondered if the females
would be immune.

40:43.927 --> 40:46.760
Something you might’ve mentioned
before she almost killed me.

40:46.927 --> 40:49.043
<i>- l only thought of it now.
- Colonel Sheppard.</i>

40:49.207 --> 40:51.880
<i>So far we haven’t run into
a single Wraith, sir.</i>

40:52.047 --> 40:55.596
<i>Understood. Sheppard to Daedalus.</i>

40:55.807 --> 40:57.877
<i>- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over.</i>

40:58.047 --> 41:01.244
They’re all human and the air is good.
l think we’re out of the woods.
