WEBVTT

00:02.652 --> 00:05.085
<i>Oh, that's fresh, dude.
Yeah, that's real nice.</i>

00:05.121 --> 00:07.054
<i>Seriously, you're gonna bring
that up again? Jerry, Jerry,</i>

00:07.089 --> 00:08.856
Jerry... I'm so sick of hearing
about Jerry, man.

00:08.891 --> 00:11.091
- Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.
- Hey, hey, hey, uh,

00:11.127 --> 00:12.146
Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.

00:12.147 --> 00:13.147
- This one's tapped, buddy.
- Yeah, give me a second.

00:13.162 --> 00:15.763
Like, if Jerry jumped off a
bridge would you jump off it, too?

00:15.798 --> 00:17.297
- Which bridge?
- Guys, guys...

00:17.333 --> 00:18.699
- Which bridge, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:18.734 --> 00:20.401
Guys, guys, please stop arguing, okay?
Can you just...

00:20.436 --> 00:22.609
can you do your jobs today?
We got a bunch of customers in here.

00:22.644 --> 00:23.604
I want to take advantage of it.

00:23.639 --> 00:25.572
Look, can you just tell him
to get rid of Jerry first?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.007
I'm sorry,
I don't even know who that is.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.976
- My tapeworm.
- You have a tapeworm?

00:29.011 --> 00:29.977
- Yeah, he got a worm.
- Yeah. Got a tapeworm.

00:30.012 --> 00:30.878
And you named it?

00:30.913 --> 00:32.079
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

00:32.113 --> 00:33.347
Yeah, okay, great. Look, guys,
can we not do this?

00:33.382 --> 00:35.783
Can we not talk about worms
or sewers or rats today, with all these

00:35.818 --> 00:37.718
people in here?
We got a good thing going.

00:37.753 --> 00:39.920
- Charlie, new keg.
- Well, I just think maybe I'm a little sensitive

00:39.955 --> 00:42.029
because it's Valentine's
Day and I don't really

00:42.064 --> 00:43.652
want to hear about Jerry all day long.

00:43.687 --> 00:44.425
But, yeah, fine, what do you want...

00:44.460 --> 00:45.926
you want me to put pink ink in
the beer or something,

00:45.961 --> 00:47.561
- make it all inky and pink?
- I... No, no, no, no.

00:47.596 --> 00:49.396
I don't want to do
Valentine's Day shit, okay?

00:49.432 --> 00:51.298
I don't want to do that.
All right, look, all these people

00:51.333 --> 00:53.300
are in here today because they
don't have people who love them

00:53.335 --> 00:55.269
and get them shit on Valentine's Day.
All right?

00:55.304 --> 00:57.504
So, can we not remind them
of that with inky beer?

00:57.540 --> 00:59.239
All right, fine. Can you just
tell him to get lost, then?

00:59.275 --> 01:00.741
And then we'll go back
to the way things were.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.042
- Who?
- Jerry.

01:02.078 --> 01:03.644
- The worm?
- Yeah.

01:03.679 --> 01:06.287
It's an intestinal parasite,
incapable of complex thought.

01:06.322 --> 01:08.515
You just described my ex-husband.

01:08.551 --> 01:10.651
- Oh...
- Oh...

01:10.686 --> 01:11.856
- Yeah, he's a...
- He can't think, yeah.

01:11.857 --> 01:12.657
That's pretty funny.

01:12.722 --> 01:14.888
- Hey, Dee! Yeah!
- All right, Dee!

01:14.924 --> 01:18.058
Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!

01:18.094 --> 01:19.693
Dee is in the house, uh,
Dee is in the house,

01:19.729 --> 01:21.662
- uh, Dee is in the house.
- Oh... - Oh...

01:21.697 --> 01:23.497
- Thanks for the chant, guys. What's up?
- Yeah, no,

01:23.532 --> 01:25.733
we were talking about the new Dee,
the funny one.

01:25.768 --> 01:26.635
- Her?
- Yeah.

01:26.667 --> 01:27.736
- Yeah.
- Why are you calling her Dee?

01:27.770 --> 01:30.070
Oh, well, she's like a new regular.
She's been coming in here.

01:30.105 --> 01:31.271
You know, trying
to make her feel more at home.

01:31.307 --> 01:34.074
- It's a nickname, short for Dottie.
- Then call her Dot.

01:34.110 --> 01:36.443
Nah, we already started calling
her Dee and it kind of stuck.

01:36.479 --> 01:38.312
You know, can't really change it now.
It's locked in.

01:38.347 --> 01:39.680
That's my nickname, bitch.
Don't you take my nickname.

01:39.715 --> 01:41.081
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

01:41.117 --> 01:42.883
- You bitch! Get out of here!
- What are you...

01:42.918 --> 01:44.251
Don't-don't yell at the customers, okay?

01:44.286 --> 01:45.886
Look, we got a good thing
going here, all right?

01:45.921 --> 01:47.421
We got a bunch of new customers in here.

01:47.456 --> 01:49.123
We got a regular,
we might get more regulars.

01:49.158 --> 01:50.691
- Let's not screw this up.
- Guys, guys.

01:50.726 --> 01:52.960
- I've got news, I've got glorious news.
- Oh!

01:52.995 --> 01:55.028
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

01:55.064 --> 01:56.730
Mac is in the house,
Mac is in the house.

01:56.766 --> 01:58.732
Thanks for the chant, guys.
Listen, I need everybody

01:58.768 --> 02:00.734
to drop everything and
come out to the back alley.

02:00.770 --> 02:03.036
There is an unopened crate out there.

02:03.072 --> 02:04.938
- An un... an unopened crate?
- Crate? Oh! - Crate?

02:04.974 --> 02:07.040
- Hey, there's a crate!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:07.076 --> 02:07.858
- We got a crate.
- Let's go!

02:07.859 --> 02:08.758
- We have a crate.
- No.

02:09.011 --> 02:10.077
- What, what?
- Stop, hey, stop!

02:10.112 --> 02:11.378
- What? What?
- Stop! Stop.

02:11.413 --> 02:13.247
We got a bar full of customers here.

02:13.282 --> 02:15.349
So what? Oh! Oh, shit, okay,
okay, you know what I'll do?

02:15.384 --> 02:17.284
Um, I can put a fan
next to the yuck puddle,

02:17.319 --> 02:19.186
- and the smell's gonna clear everybody out.
- Oh!

02:19.221 --> 02:20.788
I don't want to clear everybody out.
I'm saying

02:20.823 --> 02:22.456
why are we running out
of the bar to-to look

02:22.491 --> 02:24.992
- in some dumb crate?
- Well, it's not about the crate.

02:25.027 --> 02:26.326
It's about the mystery of
what's inside the crate

02:26.362 --> 02:27.728
- that gets us.
- Yeah, the straw.

02:27.763 --> 02:29.573
- Yeah. Well, not the straw, though.
- No.

02:29.573 --> 02:30.544
- Not the straw?
- No, not the straw.

02:30.545 --> 02:31.845
- Whatever's in the crate, like...
- Oh.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.375
- Yeah, it's worth a look.
- It's not worth a look.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.102
It's trash. There's nothing in there.
There never is.

02:35.137 --> 02:36.303
This is what I'm saying. Why...

02:36.338 --> 02:37.805
We're always running outside,

02:37.840 --> 02:39.706
out into the world,
looking for riches and treasures

02:39.742 --> 02:42.009
when we've got everything
we need right here.

02:42.044 --> 02:45.078
Oh, you're saying we do, like,
a booze for money type scheme.

02:45.114 --> 02:46.964
That's good. Who came up with that?

02:46.965 --> 02:47.665
- Oh. Was it me?
- Who came up with that?

02:47.750 --> 02:49.416
Whoever invented the idea of a bar.

02:49.451 --> 02:51.084
Which is what we decided to do years ago

02:51.120 --> 02:53.420
when we bought this goddamn place.
So, can we please,

02:53.455 --> 02:55.222
for once in our lives,
not go chasing after crates?

02:55.257 --> 02:57.324
You know, and talk about worms?

02:57.359 --> 02:59.159
Right?
Yelling at the customers and shit?

02:59.195 --> 03:02.095
Can we just do the one
thing we've never tried?

03:02.131 --> 03:04.631
Can we just do our jobs?

Damn drunks.

03:37.857 --> 03:39.857
Rum and Coke, tequila soda.

03:39.892 --> 03:41.325
Pay me.

03:42.728 --> 03:45.262
All right, that's gonna be five.

03:45.298 --> 03:46.730
Out of 20.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.030
Yup.

03:53.065 --> 03:54.631
Aw, she wants another mojito.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.366
Looks like our regular's
got herself a usual.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.701
You bet.

03:58.214 --> 04:00.304
Yo. I am all done with my work.

04:00.339 --> 04:02.072
Can we go check out that crate now?

04:02.108 --> 04:03.507
What? You're not done.

04:03.542 --> 04:04.842
Shit, how'd you know?

04:04.877 --> 04:06.110
Because the bar's still open.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.845
You're not done till we close.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.546
Hey, what do you say you
and me go out the back

04:09.582 --> 04:11.148
and check out that crate.
Just the two of us...

04:11.183 --> 04:13.383
No one else has to know.
Just to get it off our minds.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.519
It's not on my mind, okay?
Let it go. Christ, five people

04:15.554 --> 04:17.353
have walked in here since we
started this conversation.

04:17.389 --> 04:19.423
Can you go check their IDs
so we don't get another

04:19.458 --> 04:21.291
underage drinking
situation on our hands?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.926
- Just got my mind on that crate.
- Right, well,

04:22.962 --> 04:24.394
- get your mind on your job.
- Done, done, done.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.474
- Done with my work.
- Oh, Christ, they're like dominoes.

04:26.509 --> 04:27.431
Frank, you're not done

04:27.466 --> 04:29.733
- until the end of the day.
- I already cooked the books.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.835
How about you don't cook the
books so we can actually tell

04:31.871 --> 04:33.303
- how the business is doing?
- Oh, well...

04:33.339 --> 04:34.905
It's crazy. How are we ever gonna...

04:34.940 --> 04:36.240
Oh, the soda gun's clogged.

04:36.275 --> 04:37.708
Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?

04:37.743 --> 04:39.343
Trick Charlie into doing it.

04:39.378 --> 04:40.878
Well, I want you to do it.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.045
I can't trick Charlie.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.715
Charlie's pretending to ignore me
because he's jealous of Jerry.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.383
I-I don't want you to trick Charlie.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.718
- I want you to clear the lines.
- Speaking of Jerry...

04:47.753 --> 04:48.886
- Break time.
- What do you mean?

04:48.921 --> 04:50.087
Lunch.

04:50.122 --> 04:51.255
I'm craving salty,

04:51.290 --> 04:52.523
but Jerry likes sweet.

04:52.558 --> 04:55.225
What are you doing? Don't-don't
reach your hands directly in the...

04:55.261 --> 04:57.060
- This is sweet.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, get out of here,

04:57.096 --> 04:58.328
Frank, you're an animal.

04:58.364 --> 04:59.830
He won't stop eating,

04:59.865 --> 05:01.098
- yet he's just wasting away.
- Yeah.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.900
I mean, can you believe them?

05:02.935 --> 05:04.468
You know, I can't even play
Night Crawlers with him anymore

05:04.503 --> 05:05.903
'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.271
I'm gonna stop you there,
Charlie, because

05:07.306 --> 05:09.714
I've exhausted my daily quota
of worm talk and worm-related issues.

05:09.749 --> 05:10.607
- What are you doing?
- Yeah.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.842
- Don't reach your hands in there!
- Why not?

05:11.877 --> 05:13.343
Jesus Christ... Oh, God. Look,

05:13.379 --> 05:15.979
can you just... can you please
go clear the lines for me?

05:16.015 --> 05:16.980
Are they clogged?

05:17.101 --> 05:17.937
Yeah.

05:18.037 --> 05:20.271
- Just trick Dee into it.
- It's not a tri...

05:20.306 --> 05:21.939
See, this is the problem.
You guys all think that work

05:21.974 --> 05:24.429
is tricking people. It's not.
It's just your job.

05:24.464 --> 05:25.676
So, can you please go do it?
In all the time

05:25.712 --> 05:27.511
that we've talked about tricking
each other into doing our jobs

05:27.547 --> 05:28.979
we could've made 1,000 drinks.

05:29.015 --> 05:30.247
Yeah, maybe.

05:30.283 --> 05:31.849
All right, let me see if I can
trick Mac into it first.

05:31.884 --> 05:34.303
Don't trick anybody, just do it...
Oh, goddamn.

05:34.338 --> 05:36.087
I need two shots of whiskey.

05:36.122 --> 05:38.289
Two shots of whiskey. Okay, yes, nice.

05:38.734 --> 05:40.267
Finally, somebody's actually working.

05:40.302 --> 05:41.835
You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.

05:41.871 --> 05:44.238
- I appreciate you.
- All right, what are you doing?

05:44.273 --> 05:45.906
No, no, no, no, no.

05:45.941 --> 05:47.407
- That was a big one. Thank you.
- The other one, too.

05:47.443 --> 05:48.942
Yeah, that's what this is. Okay, so,

05:48.978 --> 05:50.577
clearly, you're not busy,
so, I need somebody

05:50.613 --> 05:52.246
to clear the lines.
The soda gun's clogged.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.615
Did Charlie ask you to trick me?

05:54.650 --> 05:56.383
Trick you? No, the... It's not a trick.

05:56.418 --> 05:58.352
The soda gun is clogged,
I cannot make drinks.

05:58.387 --> 05:59.787
I don't know.
I don't trust Charlie today.

05:59.822 --> 06:01.221
You know, I made him a valentine...

06:01.257 --> 06:03.190
He hasn't given me shit yet in return.

06:03.225 --> 06:05.959
Why the hell did you do that?
We don't do valentines anymore.

06:05.995 --> 06:08.923
I know, but we used to, and it was fun,
you know? It was a goof.

06:08.948 --> 06:10.648
It wasn't a goof. You guys were
supposed to give valentine's

06:10.683 --> 06:12.783
cards to each other, but instead
you were just sticking hate mail

06:12.818 --> 06:14.785
in a suggestion box covered in hearts.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.787
I'll give it to you, though...
it got a little nasty at the end.

06:16.822 --> 06:18.022
A-A little bit nasty?

06:18.057 --> 06:19.657
One of you put anthrax in the box.

06:19.692 --> 06:21.425
Or do you not remember
the anthrax scare?

06:21.460 --> 06:23.627
Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.

06:23.663 --> 06:26.797
To many,
9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.

06:27.592 --> 06:28.832
That's a good point.
No, I'm talking about

06:28.868 --> 06:30.601
a different anthrax scare,
but it shouldn't concern you.

06:30.636 --> 06:32.770
- Stop it!
- She just talks too much.

06:33.419 --> 06:34.939
- Hey-oh!
- Oh!

06:34.974 --> 06:36.473
- Cricket!
- Cricket!

06:36.509 --> 06:38.008
- Cricket!
- Hey, you guys mind

06:38.044 --> 06:40.210
if I go in the bathroom
and smoke some PCP?

06:40.246 --> 06:41.579
- No, dude, you do you!
- Go for it.

06:41.614 --> 06:42.680
You do you!

06:42.715 --> 06:44.181
- You do you!
- You do you!

06:44.216 --> 06:45.816
We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.

06:45.851 --> 06:49.148
What are you doing? Guys, guys, guys,
what in the hell are you doing?

06:49.148 --> 06:50.100
- Cricket.
- Cricket.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.022
Yeah, Cricket. This has got to stop,
you guys. This is nuts.

06:52.058 --> 06:53.991
We can't go around
encouraging homeless men

06:54.026 --> 06:55.659
to smoke PCP in our restrooms,

06:55.695 --> 06:57.628
you know, trying to trick
each other into doing our jobs

06:57.663 --> 07:00.397
and getting fired up at the-the
mere mention of a crate.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.299
- Oh, but it's just such a mystery, isn't it?
- Yeah.

07:02.335 --> 07:03.801
- Cool crate.
- It's a big box.

07:03.836 --> 07:05.402
Yeah, yeah, it really isn't though.
It's just trash.

07:05.438 --> 07:07.404
It's trash that somebody left behind.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.073
Hey, but if it's mystery you want,

07:09.108 --> 07:11.108
you know, what about the
mystery of the yuck puddle?

07:11.143 --> 07:13.410
What the hell is that thing, you know?
Why won't it dry up?

07:13.446 --> 07:14.778
Why won't it harden?

07:14.814 --> 07:16.580
It shifts. I've seen it shift.

07:16.616 --> 07:18.749
He's seen it shift.
You see, we shouldn't have

07:18.784 --> 07:20.684
an amorphous shifting blob
in the bar, you know?

07:20.720 --> 07:22.853
So why don't you and Mac go solve

07:22.888 --> 07:24.888
that goddamn mystery
by cleaning it up, you know?

07:24.924 --> 07:26.991
And, oh, what about the mystery
of the clogged soda gun,

07:27.026 --> 07:28.592
you know? Dee, why don't
you and Frank go solve

07:28.628 --> 07:30.828
that mystery by clearing the lines?

07:30.863 --> 07:33.030
Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.

07:33.065 --> 07:34.460
And we could probably trick
Cricket into doing it.

07:34.461 --> 07:35.261
Oh, why don't we just trick...

07:35.334 --> 07:36.667
Cricket doesn't work here though.

07:36.702 --> 07:38.002
- But that's free labor.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:38.037 --> 07:39.336
- That's kind of better.
- Get him for free.

07:39.372 --> 07:40.404
You're not... you're not getting...

07:40.439 --> 07:41.739
Hey, just do your jobs!

07:41.774 --> 07:43.507
Just do your jobs.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.078
Why isn't it getting any smaller?

07:54.221 --> 07:56.431
Can I be honest, dude?
I think this thing's alive.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.145
Oh, that must be what
all the bubbling's about,

07:58.146 --> 07:59.646
'cause it's, like,
trying to communicate.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.561
It definitely feeds.
I-I've found bones in it, man.

08:02.596 --> 08:04.596
- So it wants to live.
- Yeah, dude, I don't know

08:04.632 --> 08:06.013
what I'm gonna do during
the next inspection,

08:06.014 --> 08:07.502
'cause I-I can't get rid of this thing.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.669
So Dennis has sent us
in here to do the impossible.

08:10.704 --> 08:13.038
Absolutely. Dude, what is
going on with him, right?

08:13.074 --> 08:15.674
Like, there's got to be something
in this whole "do your job" angle.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.047
'Cause that doesn't
sound like Dennis to me,

08:17.048 --> 08:17.848
- you know what I mean?
- I know, dude.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.045
He's acting, like, so weird,
especially towards me.

08:20.081 --> 08:21.923
I think it's because I'm gay
and he's, like,

08:21.924 --> 08:22.924
- totally uncomfortable with it.
- Y...

08:22.984 --> 08:25.517
Well, no, 'cause he's known that
forever, so it's, you know...

08:25.553 --> 08:27.565
Well, he may have suspected it before,
but there's no way

08:27.565 --> 08:30.037
he could have known for sure.
'Cause I show no outward signs

08:30.037 --> 08:31.780
of being gay, and that's just
the end of the story, all right?

08:31.780 --> 08:34.572
But, look, either way, he's been acting
very distant towards me,

08:34.572 --> 08:37.203
and I feel like he sent me in
here to punish me or something,

08:37.203 --> 08:39.972
because, I agree, the whole,
like, "do your job" angle

08:39.972 --> 08:42.634
- just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like...
- It's, like, a bullshit thing, right?

08:42.669 --> 08:45.257
- Like...
- Unless... Oh, my God.

08:45.313 --> 08:46.040
What?

08:46.222 --> 08:49.248
Charlie, he doesn't want us
to work <i> at all.</i>

08:50.414 --> 08:51.751
- He doesn't?
- No.

08:51.786 --> 08:53.986
He doesn't want us to
mop up the yuck puddle.

08:54.022 --> 08:57.957
- He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."
- Oh!

08:57.992 --> 08:59.091
Of emotions.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.493
Of what?

09:00.528 --> 09:02.528
- It's a metaphor.
- For what?

09:02.563 --> 09:05.464
He wants us to talk through our
personal issues and be more open

09:05.500 --> 09:08.000
with our feelings because
it's Valentine's Day.

09:08.036 --> 09:11.570
Oh! Weird. That doesn't
sound like Dennis, but, uh...

09:11.606 --> 09:12.767
- Go with me here, dude.
- Okay.

09:12.768 --> 09:15.136
Valentine's Day is an entire
day dedicated to feelings,

09:15.171 --> 09:18.110
- something that Dennis doesn't have.
- Right, that's true.

09:18.146 --> 09:20.513
And so that's why he hates
Valentine's Day so much.

09:20.548 --> 09:23.182
But he's entrusted me,
because I'm a gay man

09:23.217 --> 09:25.551
- and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,
- Well, no,

09:25.586 --> 09:27.653
- to break down those walls.
- but okay. All right.

09:27.689 --> 09:29.455
- All right, cool. Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, okay, so I'll share first.

09:29.490 --> 09:31.824
- Okay.
- Okay. I have a huge surprise

09:31.859 --> 09:34.226
for Dennis, but I feel like he's
not emotionally available to...

09:34.262 --> 09:36.696
Uh, uh, Frank's gonna
leave me for Jerry, man.

09:36.731 --> 09:39.265
Oh, uh, I was talking. But, uh,

09:39.300 --> 09:41.867
I guess we'll, um...
we'll do your thing first.

09:41.903 --> 09:44.070
You know he's only doing this
to get a rise out of you, right?

09:44.105 --> 09:46.338
- Oh, that's so Jerry.
- No,

09:46.374 --> 09:47.740
not Jerry. Not the worm. Never the worm.

09:47.775 --> 09:49.108
We're talking about Frank, okay?

09:49.143 --> 09:51.043
If you just pretend to like the worm,

09:51.079 --> 09:52.712
then he'll probably just get rid of it.

09:52.747 --> 09:53.979
Oh, shit. You think so?

09:54.015 --> 09:55.681
I know so, buddy.

09:55.717 --> 09:57.928
- Nice, man. All right.
- Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.

09:57.963 --> 09:59.096
- Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.
- If I just give...

09:59.096 --> 10:00.532
- Thanks, Mac.
- Charlie, if you just...

10:00.533 --> 10:01.733
You're not gonna let me talk?!

10:02.623 --> 10:05.558
So, uh, you're gay, huh?

10:05.593 --> 10:07.727
For pay or for free?

10:07.762 --> 10:10.296
Uh, for free, I guess.

10:10.331 --> 10:12.531
Chump.

10:16.404 --> 10:17.903
It's taking forever.

10:17.939 --> 10:20.181
- Ugh.
- Try sucking on the other end, maybe.

10:20.216 --> 10:21.941
I'm not sucking on the other end.
Get that shit in my mouth?

10:21.976 --> 10:24.577
No, thanks. And what the hell's
going on with Dennis?

10:24.977 --> 10:26.746
Since when does he
care how the bar does?

10:27.658 --> 10:29.215
I don't know. It doesn't add up.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.351
I can't get a read on him these days.
He's just always cranky and irritated.

10:32.386 --> 10:34.253
- Rage-filled, rape-y.
- It's like,

10:34.288 --> 10:36.188
as the years go by,
he just gets more and more irrational.

10:36.224 --> 10:39.125
- Yeah, yeah.
- Especially with this whole "work the bar" angle.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.458
I mean, what is that?

10:42.816 --> 10:44.063
Unless...

10:44.689 --> 10:46.132
Oh, my God.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.034
Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.

10:49.070 --> 10:50.511
- He doesn't?
- No!

10:50.512 --> 10:53.215
He wants us to <i>work</i> on ourselves.

10:53.641 --> 10:55.341
What the shit are you talking about?

10:55.376 --> 10:57.109
Just go with me here.
It's Valentine's Day, right,

10:57.145 --> 10:59.145
a day we all used to love
and enjoy until we turned

10:59.180 --> 11:00.980
on each other with the hate mail.

11:01.015 --> 11:03.082
Dennis wants us to work
through our personal issues

11:03.117 --> 11:05.117
so we can enjoy Valentine's Day again.

11:05.153 --> 11:07.486
- I got it.
- Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna go first.

11:07.522 --> 11:10.656
I'm so mad at Charlie,
because I made him a valentine,

11:10.691 --> 11:12.691
and, you know what,
he didn't even really...

11:12.727 --> 11:14.260
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.

11:14.295 --> 11:17.563
Well, I was right in the middle
of a sentence, but... what?

11:17.598 --> 11:19.064
I gave myself the tapeworm.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.933
- Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've...
- How, you're wondering.

11:20.968 --> 11:22.401
No, I don't. No, thanks.

11:22.436 --> 11:23.602
I bought poop on the dark Web

11:23.638 --> 11:25.304
and stuffed it up my
butt to lose weight.

11:25.339 --> 11:26.872
- Jesus Christ. Uh, that's enough.
- Yeah.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.507
- Well, it took about four ounces of it.
- I-I...

11:28.543 --> 11:29.475
That's enough! I don't want to know!

11:29.510 --> 11:30.409
With the tip of a teaspoon.

11:30.444 --> 11:31.911
- Okay... Frank!
- How else?

11:31.946 --> 11:34.346
Stop answering questions
I'm not asking, okay?

11:34.382 --> 11:35.524
- I'm done, I'm done.
- I had to hold my knees

11:35.525 --> 11:36.725
above my head for a half hour

11:36.918 --> 11:38.184
- and clench my sphincter.
- Stop! Stop!

11:47.297 --> 11:48.163
Charlie, I'm mad,

11:48.164 --> 11:49.664
- and I think we need to clear the lines.
- Huh?

11:49.768 --> 11:53.002
- Uh, just-just trick somebody else into it.
- No, that's not what I'm...

11:53.037 --> 11:54.704
Wh-What are you doing?

11:55.545 --> 11:57.840
I'm trying to write a valentine.
I just...

11:57.876 --> 12:00.543
Oh. Okay.

12:00.578 --> 12:03.279
Uh, okay.
Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish.

12:03.314 --> 12:04.747
- Didn't mean to interrupt.
- Okay.

12:04.782 --> 12:06.916
I also got you
a box of chocolates, so...

12:07.575 --> 12:08.584
Right.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.852
Oh, oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Dee, Dee, Dee.

12:09.888 --> 12:11.754
- Yeah.
- Um, c-can you think

12:11.789 --> 12:14.056
of a word that rhymes with "Jerry"?

12:15.059 --> 12:16.959
- What?
- I can't think of one.

12:16.995 --> 12:19.462
Are you making a valentine
for Frank's tapeworm?

12:19.497 --> 12:22.031
Well, not if I can't think of a
word that rhymes with "Jerry."

12:22.066 --> 12:23.900
- You son of a bitch.
- What?

12:23.935 --> 12:26.135
- I can't believe you don't know!
- I have no idea!

12:26.170 --> 12:28.671
Oh, and literally everything
rhymes with "Jerry," okay?

12:28.706 --> 12:31.630
Scary, hairy, Mother Mary,
quite contrary.

12:31.976 --> 12:34.544
Woozy, woozy. Woozy from sucking lines.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.661
- Ho.
- All right, Frank, Frank, Frank,

12:36.662 --> 12:38.262
before you do another thing,

12:38.349 --> 12:40.950
- I wanted to give you a valentine.
- Unbelievable!

12:40.985 --> 12:42.170
Right in front of me?

12:42.171 --> 12:43.471
- You did?
- Yeah-huh.

12:43.521 --> 12:46.122
- Charlie. Well...
- Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,

12:46.157 --> 12:49.135
- these are just for Jerry.
- No.

12:49.170 --> 12:50.960
- Charlie. Oh.
- Yeah.

12:50.995 --> 12:53.070
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Look at that.

12:53.071 --> 12:53.871
- Thank...
- You dick.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.299
- You shouldn't have. Mmm.
- No! No, he didn't.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.833
Listen to me, I got these
for him, all right?

12:57.834 --> 12:58.534
- So no.
- Mmm?

12:58.536 --> 12:59.869
- I got these.
- Our blood sugar's low. Mmm.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.672
- Oh, guess what, I bought these for him.
- Mmm...

13:04.175 --> 13:05.875
You fool!

13:05.910 --> 13:07.977
- It's so good, Charlie.
- Those chocolates

13:08.012 --> 13:10.313
that you're so gleefully devouring

13:10.348 --> 13:14.216
are chock-full of Bye-Bye Jerry pills.

13:16.054 --> 13:17.620
You wouldn't.

13:17.655 --> 13:19.322
Oh, but I would, Frank.

13:19.357 --> 13:21.857
You see, I knew you'd never
take the pills willingly.

13:21.893 --> 13:23.292
But Jerry...

13:23.328 --> 13:25.394
Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?

13:26.021 --> 13:27.126
You poisoned me.

13:27.165 --> 13:28.865
No. No, he poisoned me.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.199
At worst, you're properly medicated.

13:31.302 --> 13:32.268
You son of a bitch.

13:32.303 --> 13:34.305
- Charlie.
- Bye-bye... Jerry!

13:34.647 --> 13:35.789
I'm poisoned.

13:35.824 --> 13:37.090
Poisoned! I'm poisoned.

13:37.125 --> 13:37.991
What are you doing?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.526
- We've been poisoned.
- No, No.

13:39.561 --> 13:40.694
No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned.

13:40.729 --> 13:41.995
- They're just...
- Plenty more poison

13:42.030 --> 13:43.096
where that came from!

13:43.131 --> 13:44.531
- Uh, there is no...
- So, don't even think

13:44.566 --> 13:45.832
about trying to get another worm, Frank.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.000
And there are no-no worms.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.536
- Nobody has worms.
- Well, not anymore they don't.

13:49.571 --> 13:51.137
Don't leave. Please, don't leave.

13:51.173 --> 13:52.372
Guys, what are you doing?

13:52.407 --> 13:53.640
Take this discussion someplace else.

13:53.675 --> 13:56.109
No, I'm good because I've
had a great Valentine's Day.

13:56.144 --> 13:57.143
Bye-bye, Jerry.

13:57.179 --> 13:58.211
Are you serious?!

13:58.246 --> 14:00.714
You son of a bitch, Charlie.
You screwed me, okay?!

14:00.749 --> 14:01.781
- What are you talking about?
- You know what...

14:01.817 --> 14:03.383
screw you, Charlie!

14:03.418 --> 14:05.618
I'm not gonna let some worm
beat me on Valentine's Day.

14:05.654 --> 14:06.853
- Don't talk about...
- Why are you going on and on about it?

14:06.888 --> 14:08.688
I... I did this for you, Charlie.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.756
What?

14:09.791 --> 14:11.558
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.

14:11.593 --> 14:12.892
Why would you do that?

14:12.928 --> 14:14.594
To slim down for you.

14:14.629 --> 14:17.063
Why would you...
why would you slim down for me? What?

14:17.099 --> 14:18.898
Because I overheard you
on the phone saying,

14:18.934 --> 14:20.633
"He got flabby."

14:20.669 --> 14:22.736
No, no, no, buddy.
I never said that.

14:22.771 --> 14:26.373
I sa... I-I-I said you were crabby
because you smelled crabby...

14:27.008 --> 14:29.676
'cause you've been eating
all those sewer crabs, man, but..

14:29.711 --> 14:31.311
- Take it outside.
- It was a compliment. I love when you

14:31.346 --> 14:34.381
- smell like crab, Frank.
- Take the conversation someplace else.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.882
Okay? Don't do it here.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.150
You-you didn't think I was too fat?

14:37.185 --> 14:40.920
Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal,
but I loved you that way, Frank.

14:41.323 --> 14:42.322
Fat and crabby.

14:42.357 --> 14:44.824
So, you want to try and get
this dead worm out of me?

14:44.860 --> 14:45.925
I would love to pull
that dead worm out of you.

14:45.961 --> 14:47.694
Yeah?! Come on.
Come on, now oh...

14:47.729 --> 14:49.866
Stop, stop! Goddamn it, stop.
What are you guys doing?

14:49.901 --> 14:50.744
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

14:50.779 --> 14:52.165
- Getting the worm.
- You-you're gonna talk

14:52.200 --> 14:53.700
about pulling a dead
worm out of his ass?

14:53.735 --> 14:55.301
Don't do that. Please,
don't talk about these things.

14:55.337 --> 14:57.871
Now, by the grace of God,
we somehow still have Dottie here

14:57.906 --> 14:59.272
so, please, don't scare her away.

14:59.307 --> 15:00.273
Sorry, Dottie.

15:00.308 --> 15:02.308
- Who's ready to die, bitches?!
- Dee...

15:02.344 --> 15:03.168
- Whoa!
- No.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.169
What are you doing
with the Valentine's box?

15:04.246 --> 15:06.112
- Put that down.
- All right, just think

15:06.148 --> 15:07.280
about what you're doing, Dee.

15:07.315 --> 15:08.581
I know exactly what I'm doing.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.816
Okay, okay, fine.
Dee, just don't mention...

15:09.851 --> 15:11.751
- I am busting out the anthrax.
- No!

15:11.787 --> 15:13.586
- And I'm out.
- Dottie, no.

15:13.622 --> 15:14.521
No, you don't have to go.

15:14.556 --> 15:15.688
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Charlie.

15:15.724 --> 15:19.492
I'm getting a goddamn valentine
right goddamn now, or so help me God...

15:19.528 --> 15:20.860
I will end us all.

15:20.896 --> 15:22.228
No, don't.
Give the bitch what she wants.

15:22.264 --> 15:23.730
- I will...
- I'm so frustrated right now.

15:23.765 --> 15:24.798
Okay, fine, Dee.
You know what I'm gonna do?

15:24.833 --> 15:25.932
I'm gonna sing you a song.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.434
Okay? A Valentine's Day song?

15:27.469 --> 15:28.401
All right? Is that... will that work?

15:28.437 --> 15:30.336
- Fine. Sing a song.
- Okay.

15:30.372 --> 15:32.639
Uh... a Dee song.

15:34.176 --> 15:36.389
- Nothing rhymes with Dee.
- Every...!

15:36.872 --> 15:38.244
Everything rhymes with Dee.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.579
- I mean, literally, everything rhymes...
- Okay.

15:39.614 --> 15:40.747
Okay, fine. I'll-I'll think of things.

15:40.782 --> 15:42.682
Okay, j-j-just relax. Uh, uh...

16:32.734 --> 16:34.434
That was...

16:34.469 --> 16:36.336
that was really...

16:37.025 --> 16:38.238
really pathetic.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.468
What?

16:41.943 --> 16:44.377
I wrote a couple words
on a construction paper,

16:44.412 --> 16:47.447
pink and red, and you sing
a heart song for me?!

16:48.583 --> 16:49.716
You made me do it!

16:49.751 --> 16:51.818
Yeah! And you said you loved me!

16:51.853 --> 16:54.020
- Ew!
- You bitch!

16:54.055 --> 16:55.388
Look, that song was
derivative of a song I wrote

16:55.423 --> 16:56.723
- for the waitress, anyway, then.
- Yeah, but guess what?

16:56.758 --> 16:57.790
Frank, grab that anthrax!

16:57.826 --> 16:59.025
Grab it! Grab it!

16:59.060 --> 17:00.026
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:00.061 --> 17:01.761
Stop! Stop! Stop.

17:01.796 --> 17:03.897
What are you...
what are you guys doing?!

17:03.932 --> 17:05.698
All right, this is nuts! This is crazy!

17:05.733 --> 17:08.601
I mean, I-I-I can't believe
we blew another opportunity

17:08.637 --> 17:10.036
to have a working bar.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.438
To have a successful business together!

17:12.473 --> 17:15.040
Because you assholes get so
worked up over Valentine's Day,

17:15.076 --> 17:17.076
the dumbest holiday that ever existed!

17:17.112 --> 17:19.112
But I thought you were
trying to get us to focus

17:19.146 --> 17:20.547
on ourselves and focus
on Valentine's Day.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.714
What?!

17:21.750 --> 17:23.383
Are-are you insane?!

17:23.417 --> 17:27.186
I... All I've been saying is
to please focus on the bar!

17:27.222 --> 17:28.688
But you just couldn't do it!

17:28.723 --> 17:30.390
Dennis, I got to say,
I feel like this is

17:30.425 --> 17:31.324
just about something else.

17:31.359 --> 17:33.993
It's... It's not about
something else, it's...

17:34.029 --> 17:35.628
- The bar is fine.
- Yup.

17:35.664 --> 17:36.930
- This is... something else is up.
- It's always fine, yeah.

17:36.965 --> 17:38.498
You know what it is?

17:38.533 --> 17:40.400
- This is 'cause you hate Valentine's Day.
- It's not because

17:40.435 --> 17:41.601
I hate Valentine's Day.

17:41.636 --> 17:42.902
- It's because I-I just want...
- No, that's what it is.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.771
- He's trying to distract us from Valentine's Day.
- Mm-hmm.

17:44.806 --> 17:47.006
- That's it.
- I'm not trying to distract anybody from Valen...

17:47.042 --> 17:48.641
- Yeah, you know why, though, you guys?
- That's the thing, yeah.

17:48.677 --> 17:50.410
It's because he doesn't
have any feelings and we do.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.911
Yeah, because we have feelings
and you don't,

17:51.947 --> 17:53.713
and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.

17:53.748 --> 17:55.715
Oh, stop! Goddamn it!

17:55.750 --> 18:00.053
I hate Valentine's Day because
you assholes never got me anything!

18:01.323 --> 18:03.289
Okay, and I have feelings!

18:03.325 --> 18:04.457
Of course I have feelings!

18:04.492 --> 18:06.226
I have big feelings, okay?!

18:06.261 --> 18:07.860
A-and it hurts.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.029
Okay, so...

18:10.065 --> 18:12.432
so... that's why I hate Valentine's Day,

18:12.467 --> 18:15.335
and that's why I put anthrax in the box.

18:15.370 --> 18:16.736
That was you?

18:16.771 --> 18:18.404
Yes, it was me.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.427
I just...

18:19.441 --> 18:20.840
I just wanted it to stop.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.773
Okay? And it's powdered sugar,
by the way.

18:22.808 --> 18:25.011
- Oh, he's already eating it.
- I knew that.

18:26.014 --> 18:27.213
Dennis.

18:27.249 --> 18:28.414
What?!

18:28.450 --> 18:29.482
I got the crate.

18:29.517 --> 18:30.550
So what?!

18:30.585 --> 18:31.517
Open it.

18:31.553 --> 18:33.720
I'm not gonna open a goddamn crate, Mac!

18:33.755 --> 18:34.887
There's nothing in it!

18:34.923 --> 18:36.122
Just open it.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.690
You want me to open the crate?
I'll open the goddamn crate.

18:37.726 --> 18:39.325
If it'll get you to stop
focusing on it and get you

18:39.361 --> 18:41.628
to stop focusing on this goddamn
Valentine's Day bullshit.

18:42.532 --> 18:44.564
I don't know why you're so excited
about this goddamn thing.

18:44.599 --> 18:46.532
There's never anything insi...

18:51.239 --> 18:52.438
What is this?

18:52.474 --> 18:53.473
It's a gift.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.174
I got it for you.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.409
For me?

18:56.444 --> 18:57.644
Yeah.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.712
You, uh...

19:03.585 --> 19:05.818
You got this for me?

19:05.854 --> 19:07.820
I ordered it off the dark Web.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.522
I wanted it to be a surprise.

19:10.392 --> 19:12.859
Yeah.

19:13.828 --> 19:15.623
And how did you, um...

19:16.298 --> 19:19.499
How did you know that I wanted an RPG?

19:19.534 --> 19:21.034
'Cause I know you, man.

19:21.069 --> 19:24.737
Also, you casually mention RPGs,
like, a weird amount.

19:25.778 --> 19:26.906
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

19:26.941 --> 19:28.541
- You were talking about rocket launchers today,
- Yeah, you talk about them.

19:28.576 --> 19:30.243
- I think, yeah.
- That was today.

19:32.981 --> 19:34.947
This is, uh...

19:34.983 --> 19:37.283
this is cool.

19:37.319 --> 19:40.787
I still think Valentine's Day is
a bullshit holiday, but, um...

19:42.757 --> 19:44.023
...this is nice.

19:45.493 --> 19:46.859
Want to shoot it?

19:47.865 --> 19:49.060
Yes.

19:50.332 --> 19:51.431
Where's the rocket?

19:51.466 --> 19:52.999
Yeah, that should be,

19:53.034 --> 19:55.768
uh... shit, I... there's no rocket.

19:55.804 --> 19:57.136
- No rocket in there?
- There's no rocket?

19:57.172 --> 19:58.438
Ah, there's no rocket!

19:58.473 --> 19:59.639
They forgot to put the rocket in there!

19:59.674 --> 20:00.940
Dude, I'm so sorry!

20:00.975 --> 20:03.309
Mac, I don't care.

20:03.345 --> 20:04.577
I love it.

20:06.014 --> 20:08.381
You figured out the one thing
I wanted more than anything else

20:08.416 --> 20:09.415
in the entire world
and you got it for me.

20:09.451 --> 20:11.184
And...

20:12.087 --> 20:14.287
...it's perfect.

20:14.322 --> 20:16.022
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:16.057 --> 20:18.758
Yeah.

20:20.562 --> 20:22.428
Charlie, let's go get
this worm out of my ass.

20:22.464 --> 20:24.230
- Let's do it, man. All right.
- Okay.
