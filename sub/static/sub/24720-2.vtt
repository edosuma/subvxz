So, believe me, no one
here wanted him dead.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.686
Not even if he was
gonna fail you?

09:59.729 --> 10:01.949
Failed inspection still
would've been progress.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.690
Would've told us
what to fix.

10:07.998 --> 10:11.175
Meet Sparky, the wonder cannon.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.656
So, I take it you
put it in a truck

10:13.700 --> 10:15.876
so you could take it
somewhere for testing.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.791
That implies it's
fully operational?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.836
Yeah.
We're scheduled for

10:19.880 --> 10:20.881
a test firing at
Brookhaven National Laboratory

10:20.924 --> 10:21.882
later this week.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.492
We loaded Sparky up
three days ago

10:23.535 --> 10:24.885
and no one's
moved him since.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.975
He isn't
your murder weapon.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.934
Hmm, look at these
dust patterns.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.634
Scattered showers last night.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.244
This van was recently
dotted with rain,

10:36.287 --> 10:40.117
despite being parked
in a garage with a covered roof.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.032
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Mr. Kwan,

10:42.076 --> 10:43.991
but the only way
it could have gotten wet

10:44.034 --> 10:46.558
is if someone was driving it
around in the rain.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.691
Well, that's
not possible.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
I'll check
the onboard logs.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.913
They'll show if
the cannon was fired.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.751
There's nothing.

11:04.794 --> 11:08.145
You're saying the logs don't
show the cannon was fired?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.147
I'm saying the logs are blank.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.672
They're set to record
a charge level every 30 minutes,

11:12.715 --> 11:15.022
but there's no record
for this morning at 5:00 a.m.

11:15.065 --> 11:18.112
Someone wiped the logs.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.591
I need to check
the security tapes,

11:19.635 --> 11:20.984
see who's been messing
with Sparky.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.464
They've probably
been wiped as well.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.248
This is almost certainly
an inside job,

11:24.292 --> 11:26.120
judging by the position
of the seat and the mirrors,

11:26.163 --> 11:28.165
perpetrated by someone
who's about six-foot-three.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.646
Any of your employees
match that description?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.735
No, none of our employees
are that tall.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.216
But the guy
who's financing us is.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.174
BELL: When we found out you
matched the description

11:37.218 --> 11:38.828
of our killer, Mr. Amberlin,

11:38.872 --> 11:40.351
we tried to speak
with you right away,

11:40.395 --> 11:41.918
but you weren't in.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.790
HOLMES: Committing murder
can be rather unsettling,

11:43.833 --> 11:45.661
so small wonder you
didn't feel like

11:45.705 --> 11:46.967
going to work today.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.838
I had a stomach bug.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.666
You do look
rather queasy.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.755
Nausea can have many causes:

11:52.799 --> 11:56.759
food-borne viruses,
shock, guilt.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.630
Radiation poisoning.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.722
BELL: Have you been
exposed to any

12:02.765 --> 12:03.940
radioactive materials lately?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.769
No. That's crazy.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.858
We don't think it is.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.121
When your head engineer
brought us to your office,

12:11.165 --> 12:14.516
he spotted this
behind your desk.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.344
Said it's a dosimeter.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.912
Lets you know if you've been
exposed to radiation.

12:18.955 --> 12:22.611
Prior to that, he told us
that your lab required plutonium

12:22.654 --> 12:25.614
to perfect your electrolaser,
but you hadn't been able

12:25.657 --> 12:28.312
to procure any yet--
at least not legally.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.054
So we're wondering, why
do you have a dosimeter?

12:31.098 --> 12:34.971
Your secretary told us
you recently went to Japan.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.973
So?

12:37.017 --> 12:40.150
So Japan had to scale down
their nuclear power program

12:40.194 --> 12:42.065
after the Fukushima disaster.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.851
As a result, they've got
a lot of plutonium lying around.

12:44.894 --> 12:47.157
We think you took some
off their hands.

12:48.985 --> 12:53.076
Mr. Giri's visit was of the
surprise variety, wasn't it?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.949
He saw something
he wasn't supposed to.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.907
Perhaps it was
the dosimeter,

12:57.951 --> 12:59.430
perhaps it was something else.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.824
In any event, he realized
that you were in possession

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
of black market plutonium,

13:03.870 --> 13:06.829
he confronted you about it,
and you killed him.

13:06.873 --> 13:11.007
This is you driving through
toll booths last night

13:11.051 --> 13:12.400
in the truck that
houses Sparky.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.402
You took your lightning cannon
into Manhattan

13:14.445 --> 13:16.012
so you could kill Rohan Giri,

13:16.056 --> 13:19.450
then you drove it back
and wiped its logs.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.018
Look, you don't want
to cop to it, fine.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.934
But we're pretty sure
a jury is gonna see it

13:24.978 --> 13:26.283
just like we do.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.766
I didn't mean to kill him, okay?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.420
I just thought
it would knock him out,

13:32.463 --> 13:34.552
maybe put him in the hospital
for a few days.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.293
I was just trying
to buy myself time.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.469
To do what?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.517
To find my plutonium.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.866
You were right,

13:43.910 --> 13:45.085
about everything.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.217
I went to Japan,
I bought plutonium illegally

13:47.261 --> 13:49.089
and had it smuggled
back into the States.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.917
About a week ago,

13:50.960 --> 13:52.744
it was stolen.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.746
It could be it was just
a little corporate espionage--

13:54.790 --> 13:57.097
some other lab working on
an LIPC, trying to set us back--

13:57.140 --> 13:59.099
but I don't think
I'm that lucky.

13:59.142 --> 14:02.450
If it was terrorists,
then we're all in trouble.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.321
'Cause they made off
with enough plutonium

14:04.365 --> 14:06.454
to kill hundreds
of thousands of people.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.375
GREGSON:
This is Agent Kohler, NNSA.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.898
KOHLER:
Hello, everyone.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.465
He'll be taking over
the investigation

14:17.508 --> 14:18.814
into the missing
plutonium.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.903
NNSA?

14:20.947 --> 14:23.166
National Nuclear
Security Administration.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.907
We're part of the DoE,
like Inspector Giri,

14:24.951 --> 14:28.868
but we're the guys who show up
when things get ugly.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.434
Actual plutonium missing

14:30.478 --> 14:31.871
in the greater New York area,

14:31.914 --> 14:33.829
possibly in the hands
of terrorists,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.004
that's our
worst-case scenario.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.614
Whoa, what are we
talking about here,

14:36.658 --> 14:37.789
a nuclear bomb?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.269
HOLMES: According
to Mr. Amberlin,

14:39.313 --> 14:40.575
he didn't have enough
plutonium on hand

14:40.618 --> 14:42.229
for a full-scale nuclear weapon.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.796
Agent Kohler fears a dirty bomb.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.886
Yeah.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.237
Take a conventional explosive,
you coat it with plutonium,

14:50.280 --> 14:51.934
and then you set it off.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.719
It would spread the
plutonium far and wide,

14:54.763 --> 14:56.199
poison thousands of people.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.506
It would contaminate
the blast area for decades.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.377
GREGSON: If there is
a bomb out there,

15:00.421 --> 15:01.901
it could be
headed anywhere.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.946
But let's face it,
this is New York.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.600
Show me a terrorist who
doesn't want to bomb us.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.906
We got to assume
we're the target.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.951
KOHLER: My people have
sophisticated equipment.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.953
It might be able
to detect the plutonium.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.129
So, uh, we'll spearhead
the search.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.915
GREGSON: We'll look into
the robbery, see if we can

15:15.958 --> 15:17.307
find out
who stole the plutonium,

15:17.351 --> 15:19.701
and maybe figure out
where it went.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.746
Excuse me a moment.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.539
You okay?
Yeah. The, um,

15:31.582 --> 15:34.977
the light in there
was just bothering my eyes.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.545
It's possible
I overdid it today.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.982
Let's get you home.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.897
Perhaps you missed the part
about the potential

15:41.941 --> 15:44.117
weapon of mass destruction
needing to be found.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.640
No, I didn't.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.381
But the next step
would be to look

15:47.424 --> 15:49.905
at the traffic camera footage
from the area around the lab

15:49.949 --> 15:51.385
where the plutonium was stolen.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.387
We can look at that
from home.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.997
You're not doing anyone
any good like this.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.566
WATSON:
You feeling any better?

15:58.609 --> 16:01.134
Sadly, I am not.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.179
The pain is quite remarkable.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.007
[sighs]

16:05.051 --> 16:06.835
The captain just
sent over the footage

16:06.878 --> 16:08.228
from the night
of the robbery.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.838
I can go through it
myself.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.883
Just let me know
if you need anything.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.625
What I could use, given that
opiates are out of the question,

16:14.669 --> 16:15.844
is a distraction

16:15.887 --> 16:17.324
from my condition.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.326
The work generally
provides that,

16:19.369 --> 16:21.241
but as scrutinizing traffic
patterns around the scene

16:21.284 --> 16:24.244
of a robbery is not an option...

16:24.287 --> 16:26.507
How was your lunch with Lin?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.770
Actually, lunch didn't happen.
Lin had to work.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.685
But before she left,
she gave me a...

16:30.728 --> 16:32.252
a letter that my father wrote.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.905
To whom?
To me.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.038
What did it say?

16:36.082 --> 16:37.692
No clue.
I threw it away.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.650
Your long-lost father,

16:39.694 --> 16:42.566
who is a virtual stranger
to you, wrote you a missive,

16:42.610 --> 16:44.307
and you threw it away?

16:44.351 --> 16:47.441
The last time I got a letter
from my father was in college.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.530
It was a dozen pages long
and in Chinese.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.880
I spent hours trying
to read it, and then I realized

16:51.923 --> 16:53.664
it didn't make sense
in any language.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.927
His schizophrenia?

16:55.971 --> 16:58.930
Yeah, it was sad and disturbing.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.889
I didn't want
to put myself through it again.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.891
But you know what?
I felt bad for Lin.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.935
I mean, she had
so many good years with him.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.589
He stayed on his meds back then.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.375
And then, seeing that letter,
and realizing

17:08.417 --> 17:10.159
that he remembered me,
but not her...

17:12.509 --> 17:14.468
You know, I could see
that it hurt her.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.686
Spotted something?

17:16.731 --> 17:18.602
What?Spotted something
in the footage?

17:18.646 --> 17:20.039
How did...?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.561
I'm blind. I'm not deaf.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.172
Your breathing changed.
What did you see?

17:23.215 --> 17:24.694
Do you remember that article

17:24.739 --> 17:26.219
about the express delivery
companies

17:26.262 --> 17:28.089
using software to optimize
their drivers' routes?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.222
Yes.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.050
Well, there's
a whole section about

17:31.093 --> 17:33.356
how they avoid making left turns
to save time and fuel.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.010
I just saw an express

17:35.054 --> 17:37.056
delivery van making a left turn

17:37.099 --> 17:40.276
at 127th Street and 20th
at 3:00 a.m.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.799
on the night of the robbery.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.279
The late hour

17:43.323 --> 17:45.629
and the inefficient left
are suspicious.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.068
Can you make out the van's
serial number?

17:49.111 --> 17:50.243
[keyboard keys clicking]

17:50.286 --> 17:52.071
BELL:
Hey.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.420
Kohler said we should
keep our distance

17:53.463 --> 17:55.030
till he gives
the all-clear.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.902
HOLMES: You said the van was
stolen and then recovered.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.296
Here's the company report.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.993
Stolen out
on Long Island,

18:02.037 --> 18:04.953
and found looted and abandoned
two days later in New Jersey.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.303
HOLMES: Well, if our
suspicions are correct,

18:07.347 --> 18:10.350
the looting was a cover, and the
van was the actual objective.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.396
Well, the point is, the company
didn't think much of it.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.963
When something
like this happens,

18:15.006 --> 18:16.617
they just reclaim the truck,

18:16.660 --> 18:18.967
put it back in service
soon as they can.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.708
If this one was used
to transport the plutonium,

18:20.751 --> 18:22.927
then it's a good thing
you spotted it when you did,

18:22.971 --> 18:25.191
'cause they were gonna wash it
and get it back out there today.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.149
I'm detecting radiation.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.629
Beg your pardon?

18:28.672 --> 18:30.021
She downloaded
an app last night

18:30.065 --> 18:32.154
that turns her phone
into a Geiger counter.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.373
For real?

18:33.416 --> 18:34.722
It works through the camera.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.115
You have to cover
the lens with foil.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.029
I'm not sure
if I'm reading it right.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.771
You are.
May I?

18:40.815 --> 18:42.164
This indicates
alpha particles.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.600
My guys got

18:43.644 --> 18:45.994
a lot stronger readings
around the back of the truck.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.736
It's a sure sign that
there wassome plutonium inside.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.999
Is it safe to approach?Not enough radiation

18:51.042 --> 18:52.957
to be dangerous
with a short exposure.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.524
Shall we?

18:54.568 --> 18:57.005
Well, I want
to have kids some day.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.050
But you go,
tell us what you find.

19:01.618 --> 19:04.055
The report includes
mileage logs,

19:04.099 --> 19:06.232
so we know exactly
how far the van went

19:06.275 --> 19:08.147
after it was stolen.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.714
It's enough distance
to account for

19:10.758 --> 19:13.064
driving from the point
of its theft to

19:13.108 --> 19:15.632
Amberlin's lab, and then to the
place where it was abandoned,

19:15.676 --> 19:17.939
about 16 miles to spare.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.289
Yeah, obviously,
they must have taken a detour

19:20.333 --> 19:23.074
to drop off the plutonium
along the way.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.251
There's a good amount of gravel
stuck in the tire treads,

19:25.294 --> 19:26.904
but the route
from where the van was stolen

19:26.948 --> 19:29.168
to where it was found
is entirely paved.

19:30.386 --> 19:33.433
So, you think it picked up
the gravel during the detour?

19:33.476 --> 19:34.999
HOLMES:
Yeah, the composition of

19:35.043 --> 19:37.088
this gravel is, I believe,
consistent with that

19:37.132 --> 19:40.266
used by the Department of Public
Works in Somerset County.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.964
If you want to find
your missing plutonium,

19:43.007 --> 19:45.575
I suggest you check properties
along the gravel roads

19:45.619 --> 19:47.708
near Bedminster, New Jersey.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.539
[Geiger counters clicking]

19:52.582 --> 19:55.716
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

19:55.759 --> 19:57.108
House belongs to
Hayden Wischer.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.762
He's on parole.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.460
Served seven years for
making homemade bombs

20:00.503 --> 20:02.375
and land mines
for local pot farms.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.116
Might be a coincidence that
a known bomb-maker lives in

20:05.160 --> 20:07.031
the same area where someone
may have stashed a supply

20:07.075 --> 20:09.947
of stolen plutonium,
but I tend to doubt it.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.297
Any sign of this Wischer guy?

20:11.340 --> 20:14.169
Not yet. No one's
seen him for a few days.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.388
There's no radiation
in the house,

20:15.431 --> 20:17.128
but my guys got a hit
in the driveway.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.565
Could be naturally-occurring,

20:18.608 --> 20:19.957
but I think we're
in the right place.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.394
Where's your
other consultant?

20:21.437 --> 20:22.960
I asked everyone to stay put

20:23.004 --> 20:24.353
till we cleared the area.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.267
She was trying to call
Wischer's parole officer.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.094
Couldn't get
a signal, so...

20:26.137 --> 20:29.228
Guys, you got to see this.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.753
So I was trying to
get a clear signal

20:32.796 --> 20:34.320
when my Geiger app went off.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.800
Gets stronger the deeper
you go into the woods.

[clicking]

20:38.149 --> 20:41.283
May I?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.242
Alpha particles.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.156
Still within safety margins,
but barely.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.202
I need a team to my location.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.638
The plutonium may be
in the woods.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.031
HOLMES:
Not in the woods.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.033
Under them.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.998
GREGSON:
Looks like some kind

21:01.042 --> 21:03.305
of a bunker.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.917
[Geiger counters clicking]

21:10.399 --> 21:12.358
You were right about Wischer.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.185
He was using the bunker
as his workshop.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.884
No sign of the plutonium,
but it's pretty damn obvious

21:16.927 --> 21:18.494
he built an explosive device

21:18.538 --> 21:20.191
sometime within
the last week or so.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.584
Unfortunately, it's gone.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.151
GREGSON:
Well, we got to find Wischer.

21:23.194 --> 21:24.674
Get him to tell us who he built
it for and where it went.

21:24.718 --> 21:25.849
That's not gonna happen.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.895
Wischer's dead.
Shot through the eye.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.463
I guess whoever
he was working for

21:30.506 --> 21:31.768
didn't want
any loose ends.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.117
May I?

21:33.161 --> 21:35.163
Yeah.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.473
Look at the tattoo.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.911
BELL:
"88" is prison gang code.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.042
"H" is the eighth letter

21:45.086 --> 21:46.435
of the alphabet.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.263
So two eights stands for "H.H."

21:48.307 --> 21:49.830
As in "Heil, Hitler."

21:49.873 --> 21:51.266
GREGSON:
That's great.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.876
Our guy wasn't
just a bomb-maker,

21:52.920 --> 21:55.270
he was in a white power gang.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.750
HOLMES:
Watson, does your phone

21:56.793 --> 21:58.926
also have an app
for locating white supremacists?

21:58.969 --> 22:00.623
Because a group of them
may now be in possession

22:00.667 --> 22:02.364
of a dirty bomb, and our
best hope of finding them

22:02.408 --> 22:04.758
has a bullet in his brain.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.376
According to prison officials,
while he was inside,

22:14.420 --> 22:17.031
Wischer was a member of the
Pure Aryan Independent Nation,

22:17.074 --> 22:18.728
A.K.A. PAIN.

22:18.772 --> 22:21.949
Now, he told the parole board he
only joined PAIN for protection,

22:21.992 --> 22:24.212
and that he would be done
with them once he was out.

22:24.255 --> 22:27.171
No one's ever done
with a prison gang.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.217
They promise you protection
while you're locked up,

22:29.260 --> 22:31.785
and then force you to work for
them for the rest of your life.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.178
This gang--
how extremist are they?

22:34.222 --> 22:36.442
Well, they're part
of the so-called

22:36.485 --> 22:40.359
Christian Identity movement.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.447
They preach
that all non-whites

22:41.490 --> 22:43.797
need to be exterminated
to usher in

22:43.840 --> 22:45.059
a new heavenly kingdom

22:45.102 --> 22:46.756
on Earth.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.150
So, basically, the American
equivalent of the Taliban.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.021
Now they have a weapon
of mass destruction.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.283
GREGSON:
Or...

22:52.327 --> 22:53.850
they rented out their bomb-maker

22:53.894 --> 22:56.375
to build the thing
for someone else.

22:56.418 --> 23:00.640
Either way, prison gangs like
PAIN have a strict hierarchy.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.293
Something like
a terrorist attack

23:02.337 --> 23:04.644
would have to be approved
by senior leadership.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.516
Think you're talking
about this guy.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.519
Colm Frick is PAIN's
top shot-caller.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.478
Unlike a lot
of prison gang leaders,

23:12.521 --> 23:13.740
he's on the outside.

23:13.783 --> 23:16.133
Served 20 years
for manslaughter,

23:16.177 --> 23:17.439
got paroled about
two years ago.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.310
Unfortunately,
he's in the wind.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.964
Absconded as soon as he got out.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.662
There's been a warrant
out for his arrest ever since.

23:22.705 --> 23:25.621
Safe bet he's either planning
to use the bomb himself,

23:25.665 --> 23:28.189
or he knows who is.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.496
Much as I'd like to help you
find this guy,

23:30.539 --> 23:32.759
I have a meeting at
the Joint Operations Center,

23:32.802 --> 23:34.674
to start preparing for
large-scale evacuations,

23:34.717 --> 23:36.197
potential mass casualties.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.069
All the nightmare possibilities.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.507
We'll take care of Frick.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.987
Hopefully, we can grab him
before the bomb goes off.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.641
Hope for the best.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.948
Prepare for the worst.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.603

23:51.604 --> 23:53.388
That's the rest of it.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.566
Portrait of a
hate-filled idiot.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.655
I don't know how this guy
ended up in charge of anything.

23:59.699 --> 24:00.917
He's a high school dropout

24:00.961 --> 24:02.658
and his whole life
is a rap sheet.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.486
Well, you only have to be
the brightest bulb of a dim lot.

24:04.530 --> 24:07.620
Racist ideology
mostly attracts

24:07.663 --> 24:09.491
failures and reprobates.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.884
Gives them a sense
of elevation

24:10.927 --> 24:12.668
that they cannot
otherwise justify.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.888
Any luck, we'll find something
which sets him apart

24:14.931 --> 24:16.672
from his fellow dullards.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.501
The better to track him by.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.502
Something like this,

24:20.546 --> 24:23.331
for example.

24:23.374 --> 24:27.117
A list of confiscated items
from... Frick's cell.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.902
Most notably,

24:28.945 --> 24:30.904
several dozen
15-millimeter figurines

24:30.947 --> 24:32.471
of Napoleonic-era soldiers,

24:32.514 --> 24:34.473
along with various paints
and brushes.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.301
He paints toy soldiers?

24:37.345 --> 24:38.868
More than paints, I suspect.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.131
Miniatures of that type
are painted for a purpose.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.569
I think Frick
is a tabletop wargamer.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.530
HOLMES: In this particular brand
of wargaming,

24:48.574 --> 24:50.445
enthusiasts use painted
miniatures to refight

24:50.489 --> 24:51.881
historical battles.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.535
Frick went to great lengths
to maintain his hobby

24:53.579 --> 24:55.537
while he was in prison,
despite the fact

24:55.581 --> 24:58.366
that his figurines, paints
and glue were all contraband.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.673
I doubt he would abandon it
now he's in hiding.

25:00.716 --> 25:01.717
[tapping keys]

25:02.979 --> 25:06.200
Well, these figurines
seem pretty specialized.

25:06.243 --> 25:09.159
I mean, there can't be that
many places you can buy them.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.031
In the morning, we will contact
the relevant hobby shops,

25:11.074 --> 25:12.989
and see if they have
any customers matching

25:13.033 --> 25:14.643
Frick's description.
Meanwhile,

25:14.687 --> 25:15.601
I think we should check
wargaming websites,

25:15.644 --> 25:17.167
message boards.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.691
It's possible he appears
in photographs

25:18.734 --> 25:20.519
taken at tournaments.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.609
I don't think you should be
working on the computer.

25:23.652 --> 25:24.523
You don't want to trigger
another headache.

25:24.566 --> 25:25.698
So far, all is well.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.569
That's the blessing
and the curse

25:27.613 --> 25:29.571
of a condition
with intermittent symptoms.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.530
There are good days
and there are bad days.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.534
So far, today has been
a good day.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.752
Which reminds me...

25:36.796 --> 25:39.146
[drawer opens]

25:40.364 --> 25:41.583
Your father's letter.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.151
I think he wrote it
on one of his good days.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.545
I threw that away for a reason.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.807
You did.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.765
But if you were resolved
not to read it,

25:49.809 --> 25:52.376
why not put it in your shredder
instead of the trash?

25:52.420 --> 25:55.118
Alternately, there are several
fireplaces in this house.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.120
You could easily have
turned it to ash.

25:57.164 --> 25:59.601
Maybe I'm just lazy.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.603
You most assuredly are not.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.344
In this case,

26:03.387 --> 26:06.434
I suspect you were leaving
yourself room to reconsider.

26:06.477 --> 26:10.133
It was a good instinct;
I advise you to follow it.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.278
Watson.

26:24.321 --> 26:27.150
You said that you thought
that my father wrote that letter

26:27.194 --> 26:28.935
on a good day. Why?

26:28.978 --> 26:31.546
While I did not open it,

26:31.590 --> 26:35.289
it was clear
that it is a brief missive.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.725
Just a few hundred
Chinese characters

26:36.769 --> 26:39.336
neatly printed
on a single sheet of paper.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.730
And given my current
difficulties,

26:41.774 --> 26:43.297
I can appreciate
how much self-discipline

26:43.340 --> 26:46.082
it would take a man
in your father's condition

26:46.126 --> 26:48.302
to write something so succinct.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.872
Okay, so he worked hard on it.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.482
I mean, it could be
more craziness.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.353
Unlikely.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.574
The envelope was resting beneath
the letter as he wrote it.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.142
From the impressions thereon,
it's clear

27:02.185 --> 27:03.926
that he penned
several drafts.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.362
So?

27:05.406 --> 27:07.321
So, from my experience,

27:07.364 --> 27:10.019
one rarely edits
when in the throes of madness.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.194
The madman perceives

27:11.238 --> 27:13.370
his every written word
to be vital.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.285
That letter was written
by someone

27:15.329 --> 27:18.419
in control of their faculties,
at least temporarily.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.988
But you already knew that.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.946
I did?

27:23.990 --> 27:26.557
You're too fine a detective
to have missed it.

27:26.601 --> 27:29.473
Then why did I throw
the letter away?

27:29.517 --> 27:31.867
If I had to guess,
I'd say that you were worried

27:31.911 --> 27:33.216
it was an attempt
at rapprochement

27:33.260 --> 27:35.392
from a man that
you had already dismissed.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.481
You were afraid
to reopen old wounds.

27:37.525 --> 27:40.441
And what's wrong with that?

27:40.484 --> 27:42.225
Nothing.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.314
But you are a detective.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.491
And that letter
is the final clue

27:47.535 --> 27:49.842
in your lifelong
personal mystery.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.234
It might confirm

27:51.278 --> 27:52.975
your theories about your father,

27:53.019 --> 27:54.498
it might force you
to reevaluate.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.065
But it is evidence,
nonetheless,

27:56.109 --> 28:00.374
and... a good detective

28:00.417 --> 28:04.334
must never ignore the evidence.

28:11.777 --> 28:12.995
Well...

28:15.389 --> 28:18.131
We have a bomb to find.

28:18.174 --> 28:20.176
The letter can wait.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.970
I guess playing in that
tournament was a bad idea.

In hindsight.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.712
HOLMES:
So was holding back

28:33.755 --> 28:35.452

far too late in the battle.

28:35.496 --> 28:36.323

gotten rid of

28:39.805 --> 28:41.458

tattoos, too.

you're Colm Frick,

yourself these days.

28:46.812 --> 28:51.207
This seems like a-a lot of fuss
over a parole violation.

This is about a hell of
a lot more than that.

[scoffs]

29:02.653 --> 29:04.438
Well it wasn't me.
I can tell you that.

Nobody I know, either.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.703
Just supposed to take
your word on that?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.226
Or use some
damn sense.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.489
I would never kill Wischer.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.709
He made me and my friends
too much money.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.145
Building bombs?

29:16.189 --> 29:17.538
Selling phones.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.541
He was smart. He knew how to...

29:20.584 --> 29:23.065
to take things apart,
and put them back together.

29:23.109 --> 29:24.327
Things like cell phones.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.895
Precious commodity in prison.

29:26.939 --> 29:31.160
Wischer could break them down
into smaller parts

29:31.204 --> 29:34.642
and modify them so they'd snap
back together without any tools.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.775
We got them inside
one piece at a time,

29:36.818 --> 29:38.298
and snap, snap, snap.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.735
Presto. Profit.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.564
So why the hell would I put
a bullet in his head, huh?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.479
Maybe because
you didn't want

29:45.522 --> 29:47.960

he'd built you a dirty bomb.

To keep all
the foot soldiers in line.

30:11.374 --> 30:13.376
To get the white prison guards
on our side.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.378
So, you honestly
expect us to believe

30:15.422 --> 30:17.380
that you are not a racist?

30:17.424 --> 30:20.122
The only color me

30:20.166 --> 30:22.777
really care about is green.

Money from drugs,

30:24.213 --> 30:25.824

protection.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.608
Mostly, we get
away with it.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.392
Now, we set off a dirty bomb,

30:29.436 --> 30:31.394
we'd be public enemy
number one.

30:31.438 --> 30:34.397
The feds would tear us apart.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.225
If no one in PAIN
had Wischer build a bomb,

30:36.269 --> 30:37.574

30:37.618 --> 30:39.576
Could be anybody.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.101
Those pot farmers
he used to hang out with,

30:42.144 --> 30:44.581
they were a bunch of nutjobs.

And there's
the Euros.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.368

30:48.411 --> 30:50.413
A few weeks back, um,
lieutenant of mine,

30:50.457 --> 30:51.980
he gets approached
by a couple of Europeans.

30:52.024 --> 30:55.592
He said they were slick, tall,
expensive suits.

30:55.636 --> 30:56.550
They wanted a bomb.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.508
Nothing nuclear,

30:58.552 --> 31:00.597
just something to blow up
a car, you know.

31:00.641 --> 31:03.600
My boys set up a meeting
with Wischer,

31:03.644 --> 31:04.993
the Europeans, they didn't show.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.213
We figured
they must've...

31:07.256 --> 31:09.432
got cold feet.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.695
Or maybe they already got
what they wanted:

31:11.739 --> 31:13.262
the name of your bomb-maker.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.881
You think he was lying?

31:22.924 --> 31:25.231
Prison gangs come in
every size and color,

31:25.274 --> 31:26.623
but they all preach
some version

31:26.667 --> 31:28.582
of "lie or die."

31:28.625 --> 31:30.671
You get interrogated,
you don't tell the truth.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.542
Sounds like PAIN
has two sets of rules,

31:32.586 --> 31:34.675
one for rank and file
and another for leadership.

31:34.718 --> 31:37.852
Frick is despicable,
but I'm inclined to believe him.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.246
Because of his story about
some European bomb shoppers?

31:40.289 --> 31:41.682
Because earlier today,

31:41.725 --> 31:43.597
I reviewed the footage
that we found

31:43.640 --> 31:45.468
of his wargaming play.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.340
He never goes for the big,
splashy victory.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.645
Instead, he carefully preserves

31:48.689 --> 31:49.951
his units,

31:49.995 --> 31:52.040
often sacrificing
important game objectives

31:52.084 --> 31:53.433
to avoid casualties.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.522
It's the exact opposite
of a terrorist mentality.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.306
I think his claim
regarding the Europeans

31:57.350 --> 31:58.307
is-is worth looking into.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.962

to figure that out.

something actionable,
I need you in the bullpen.

a New York City mosque.

they hid it in a taxi cab

The thieves' plan
relied on creating

38:33.223 --> 38:35.356
a credible dirty bomb threat.
That's why they stole

38:35.400 --> 38:37.358
the plutonium
from Dave Amberlin.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.142
But how did they find out
about the plutonium

38:39.186 --> 38:40.187
in the first place?

38:40.230 --> 38:42.494
Maybe somebody
at the lab talked.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.104
I can look into it.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.888
BELL:
No. No need.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.499
Mr. Amberlin is cooperating.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.979
He told us how he smuggled
the plutonium into the country.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.112
It's a funny thing.
On the day it came into port,

38:52.155 --> 38:53.722
records show

38:53.766 --> 38:55.942
that one of the port's
radiation alarms went off.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.901
Your agency is in charge
of investigating those alarms.

38:58.945 --> 39:02.122
Right? In fact, you personally
cleared that particular alarm.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.168
You intentionally let
the plutonium through.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.474
Then you told the Dutchmen
about it

39:06.518 --> 39:08.258
so they could use it
in their heist.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.912
That's the craziest damn thing
I've ever heard.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.393
We get false alarms
all the time.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.612
Well, we thought
there could be

39:13.655 --> 39:15.396
an honest mistake,
so we looked into you.

39:15.440 --> 39:19.879
Turns out that you have a
new girlfriend from Amsterdam

39:19.922 --> 39:23.317
named Natalie Van Rijn.

39:25.493 --> 39:28.322
Her cousin is one
of the jewel thieves.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.458
Whether you were honey-trapped
or whether the whole thing

39:33.501 --> 39:35.198
was your idea, we're
not quite certain.

39:35.242 --> 39:38.288
But, at this point,
it doesn't much matter.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.594
BELL: We paid
Natalie a visit.

39:39.638 --> 39:43.337
She admitted to hooking you up
with the thieves.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.861
She's the one who called in
the tip about the bomb.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.429
She told us the plutonium
is in a storage unit

39:48.473 --> 39:50.692
in Long Island City.

39:51.693 --> 39:54.130
You arrested her.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.132
Hours ago.

39:56.176 --> 39:58.091
Now it's your turn.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.312
[footsteps approaching]

40:02.356 --> 40:04.184
You're up early.

40:04.227 --> 40:07.448
Yes, and just look
how productive I've been.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.364
Ah, you're trying
the puzzles.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.888
I recognize that,
like any potent adversary,

40:12.932 --> 40:14.412
PCS is best attacked
from different angles.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.717
Yesterday,
I helped foil

40:15.761 --> 40:17.066
an international ring
of jewel thieves.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.721
And, today,
I'm assembling Unicorn Utopia,

40:19.765 --> 40:20.940
ages eight and up.

40:20.983 --> 40:22.376
And?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.465
I prefer the jewel thieves.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.080
How long are you going to be
at the cemetery?

40:32.081 --> 40:33.518
It's customary
in Chinese culture

40:33.561 --> 40:35.520
to leave food at the grave
of a loved one, and oranges

40:35.563 --> 40:37.609
are the most
common offering, so...

40:37.652 --> 40:39.698
May I take it that you read
your father's letter?

40:43.005 --> 40:46.095
When you're done with that one,
I have three more downstairs.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.489
If you like
Unicorn Utopia,

40:48.533 --> 40:51.013
you are gonna love
Pretty Princess Party.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.544
♪

40:59.587 --> 41:02.503
WATSON: They took
the flowers away already?

41:02.547 --> 41:06.594
They clear the graves
every other Thursday.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.988
You wanted to talk?

41:09.031 --> 41:11.991
I read the letter last night.

41:12.034 --> 41:14.559
It wasn't what I expected.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.604
What do you mean?

41:16.648 --> 41:19.433
I guess I thought that he wrote
the letter when he wasn't well.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.435
But I was wrong.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.829
The things he said were special.

41:23.872 --> 41:27.223
I'm happy for you.

41:27.267 --> 41:32.881
He might have addressed
the letter to me...

41:32.925 --> 41:35.623
but it was about you.

41:35.667 --> 41:39.105
I don't know exactly
when he wrote it,

41:39.148 --> 41:42.195
but he could tell
that his health was failing.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.937
He didn't want to die
without telling me about you.

41:47.026 --> 41:50.246
He said that you were...

41:50.290 --> 41:52.466
amazing.

41:52.510 --> 41:56.078
And beautiful. And that
he loved you very much.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.649
He wanted you to find me.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.869
He wanted us to be sisters.

42:03.912 --> 42:06.654
Obviously, that happened
without him.

42:06.698 --> 42:11.659
But... the time that you had
together, he remembered it.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.794
He remembered you.
