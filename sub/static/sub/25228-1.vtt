Glad you grew some balls
and decided to join us.

04:19.708 --> 04:22.208
[Jake] You can thank
my youngest for that.
Mack can be very persuasive.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.958
[Mission Control]
Martian One, an FYI:

both Mack and Lena
are present in the room.

Roger that.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.375
Glad to see ARTI's back
to his usual self,

05:53.416 --> 05:56.583
but I'll be dead
before I take orders
from a goddamn machine.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.875
[Jake]
ARTI is more
than just a machine,

05:58.916 --> 06:02.000
but... right now is really
not the time for that debate.

06:02.041 --> 06:03.875
[woman]
Hey! I'm just saying.

06:03.916 --> 06:06.125
We all know what happened
before it was rebooted.

[Jake] Negative, ARTI!
Do not do that!

06:46.000 --> 06:48.500
[ARTI] It's protocol
to switch off the reactor
if the craft is going to crash.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.125
[Jake] We're not crashing,
now override that
damn protocol!

for Christ's sake!

Memory banks compromised
by external breach.

audible, please repeat.

07:07.916 --> 07:10.791

Lena and Mack, if you
hear this, I want you--

07:10.833 --> 07:14.041
[Mission Control on radio]
This is Mission Control calling
Martian One. Please come in.

Our reactor engines
are shutting down.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.500

for Christ's sake!

07:54.541 --> 07:56.916
[Jake]
Mission Control,
if you can hear us--

07:56.958 --> 08:00.791
Lena, Mack,
if you can hear this,
I want you to know that--

08:53.250 --> 08:55.583
[Sterling]
They've locked me out
of the bloody room.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.458
Sterling, did you even
go home last night?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.166
Three years of negotiations,
and now--

08:59.208 --> 09:01.750
now she springs this.
Don't even try to defend her.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.000
She obviously doesn't
think a crash investigation
should perhaps, possibly,

09:05.041 --> 09:08.333
-maybe include the government's
lead investigator.
-[Mack sighs]

09:08.375 --> 09:10.916
Should never have let
Silicon Valley get their claws
into the space program.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.750
-Sterling.
-What?

09:12.791 --> 09:15.041
Quit being such a damn baby.

09:17.666 --> 09:21.333
-Oh good, you're coming.
-[chuckles]

09:26.958 --> 09:29.000
It's like a ghost town
around here.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.833
But look to the future, right?

09:34.250 --> 09:36.375
What's the top speed
on the new Rover?

09:36.416 --> 09:38.166
We'll find out.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.583
Hyper-light holding up?

09:39.625 --> 09:40.958
Mmm.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.041
[Sterling]
Right, right, I get it.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.916
Corporate confidentiality.

09:44.958 --> 09:47.500
But faster-than-light
communication--

09:47.541 --> 09:50.375
I mean, that's
a massive breakthrough.

09:50.416 --> 09:54.250
-Maybe if we had it
six years ago, it might be--
-Oh look! My floor.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.125
[Sterling]
You sure you're ready?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.583
[Mack] You sure
you're not just jealous
I have your old job?

10:03.458 --> 10:07.125
Maybe get the lander
down safely before
you start bragging.

10:09.541 --> 10:10.916
[chimes]

10:12.833 --> 10:15.666
So now I have to wait
to be invited in like
some kind of vampire?

10:15.708 --> 10:19.375
It makes sense.
You've been dead to us
since you switched teams.

10:19.416 --> 10:21.166
Okay.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.333
I'll wait.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.500
But people need answers.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.625
[chuckles]

10:27.666 --> 10:30.208
The families need
answers, Sterling.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.916
The people can wait.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.875
Just trying to do my job, Mack.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.500
-[chimes, beeping]
-[ARTI] Good morning, Mission
Supervisor Mackenzie Wilson.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.833
The Intrepid probe's
geostation orbit

10:59.875 --> 11:04.791
is stable at an altitude
of 342 kilometers above Mars.

11:04.833 --> 11:10.375
You asked me to monitor
an expected asteroid pass
at 9:53 a.m. this morning.

11:10.416 --> 11:13.375
It will travel well clear
of the probe's orbit.

11:13.416 --> 11:16.000
I'm pleased to report
that all systems are nominal

11:16.041 --> 11:17.916
on the Mars lander craft.

11:17.958 --> 11:20.791
Launch countdown initiated.

11:23.333 --> 11:27.458
Wait, what? Why are we readying
for launch five hours early?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.916
[ARTI]
There's a sandstorm
approaching the landing site,

11:29.958 --> 11:32.416
-and the dust may
affect engine function.
-[thunder rumbles]

11:32.458 --> 11:34.375
Okay. All right,
so it's a better
launch window,

11:34.416 --> 11:36.666
I can see that,
but who authorized it?

11:36.708 --> 11:39.875
[whirs, hums]

11:40.875 --> 11:42.333
[ARTI]
I did.

11:49.541 --> 11:50.958
Call Lena.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.541
[ARTI]
Your sister is in a meeting.

11:52.583 --> 11:54.125
-She may not respond.
-[comm ringing]

12:04.500 --> 12:06.541
-Halt the countdown.

is your override?

12:11.708 --> 12:13.750
-[Lena on computer] Mack?
-Real funny story!

12:13.791 --> 12:16.250
Your pet robot is getting ready
to launch early, unauthorized.

12:16.291 --> 12:18.791
-[Lena] I swear
I was going to tell you.
-Tell me what?

12:18.833 --> 12:20.958
-[Lena] ARTI's taking lead
on the crash investigation.
-[Mack] What?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.333
[Lena]
The board
agreed it last night.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.791
[Mack]
T-minus 30.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.916
[Lena]
I trust ARTI.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.291
[Mack] You are putting
a recruit into battle

12:32.333 --> 12:34.416
before he's even out of basic.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.000
[Lena]
Do you really want to know
why they demoted you?

12:37.041 --> 12:38.708
-[sighs]
-[Lena] We don't know

12:38.750 --> 12:40.875
if you did your job properly
six years ago.

12:40.916 --> 12:44.500
Be prepared
for every possibility,

12:44.541 --> 12:46.208
including human error.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.833
[Mack]
Yeah, and you be
prepared for A.I. error.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.833
[Lena] I'm going
to my office for visual.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.250
Great idea!

12:52.083 --> 12:53.583
T-minus 10.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.833
[ARTI]
All is well.

12:58.875 --> 13:02.458
Intrepid launch bay sensors
report nominal systems.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.458
-[beeps]
-[ARTI] Lander clamps released.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.333
We are go for launch.

13:22.291 --> 13:25.333
I've completed your standard
roll procedure, Mackenzie.

13:25.375 --> 13:28.125
Egress clear
from spaceship Intrepid.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.708
Lander ready for stage two.

13:33.416 --> 13:36.166
[ARTI]
Executing stage two.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.708
[beeps]

13:40.750 --> 13:44.375
57 seconds until the lander
enters the atmosphere.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.541
Running your usual analysis.

13:50.666 --> 13:52.083
Systems normal.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.083
Parachute deployment
in 10 seconds.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.000

14:05.333 --> 14:10.500

14:12.333 --> 14:13.833
Parachute deployed.

14:13.875 --> 14:16.041
-[alarm clanks]
-[ARTI] I have an alert.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.041
The aeroshell temperature
is 11 percent above normal.

14:19.083 --> 14:22.666
Heat shield detachment
in three, two, one.

14:22.708 --> 14:24.791
[crackling]

14:24.833 --> 14:26.708
I cannot release
the heat shields.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.583
There are mechanical
malfunctions.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.250
Run a secondary
ejection protocol.

14:30.291 --> 14:33.708
[ARTI]
Back-up detachment failed.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.000
What's our contingency?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.583
[ARTI]
I'm running simulations.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.708
This is not what
we would've hoped for.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.416
[beeping]

14:44.458 --> 14:46.541
My prediction
of success is only 7%.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.250
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

14:48.291 --> 14:50.666
Seriously, if we wasted
a launch to Mars,

14:50.708 --> 14:53.583
I am gonna...
rip you out of the ceiling!

15:04.500 --> 15:06.000
Come on.

15:07.666 --> 15:10.125
Run a partial lander opening
to pop the heat shield.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.083
We'll crack it like a nut.

15:17.083 --> 15:21.458
[ARTI]
This has improved the odds,
but only to 42%.

[sighs]

16:02.666 --> 16:05.583
-[computer chirping]
-[ARTI] Your sister is calling.

16:08.708 --> 16:11.500
-Touchdown.
-The heat shield ejector failed,

16:11.541 --> 16:13.500
and we had to run
an emergency protocol.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.583
And that is why
we have ARTI.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.541
We ran my scenario.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.041
Which ARTI executed.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.666
Which is what it was
designed for, Lena!

16:23.708 --> 16:25.875
Brute-force processing
and high-speed maneuvering,

16:25.916 --> 16:28.583
not for abstract
problem-solving,
not to-- not to run missions!

16:28.625 --> 16:32.166
[Lena]
ARTI is so far beyond
human capabilities.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.791
Do you know what humans did?

16:34.833 --> 16:37.041
We wrote 10-feet-high
stacks of code,

16:37.083 --> 16:39.291
by hand, for the moon landings,
checked and double-checked

16:39.333 --> 16:41.375
if atomic bombs would
ignite the atmosphere.

16:41.416 --> 16:43.666
We discovered
relativity while working
in a patent office, Lena!

16:44.416 --> 16:46.416
We created A.I. to help us,

16:46.458 --> 16:49.291
not to lead us.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.208
-Dad never wanted this.
-Dad's not here.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.708

You enjoying Hyper-light?

17:06.875 --> 17:08.583
Exploring in real time?

17:08.625 --> 17:10.833
Such a game-changer,
don't you think, Mackenzie?

17:10.875 --> 17:14.916
-Mack.
-[Lena] ARTI discovered
instant communication

17:14.958 --> 17:17.583
and revolutionized
space exploration.

17:17.625 --> 17:19.250
Yeah, and who invented ARTI?

17:19.291 --> 17:21.500
[Lena]
You are living
in his world now.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.833
-A.I. will outlive us
and explore the stars.
-[scoffs]

17:48.916 --> 17:52.250

18:11.666 --> 18:14.291
So... what's my role?

18:15.458 --> 18:17.541
Can't have two generals
on a battlefield.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.208
-[Lena] You're backup.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.041
What the hell is
an "origin unknown"?

18:32.083 --> 18:34.500
If ARTI finds
something he hasn't
discovered in his learning,

18:34.541 --> 18:37.291
-he comes to us.
-Well, at least it still has
a leash around its neck.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.166
[ARTI] I'm attempting to analyze
the transmission signal.

18:43.291 --> 18:46.666
It is coming from
the decommissioned Rover-5.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.041
[beeping]

19:03.250 --> 19:05.125
It's just an igneous cap.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.875
It shouldn't be
an origin unknown.
It's got to be an error.

19:06.916 --> 19:08.625
What if the alert's
not an error?

19:08.666 --> 19:10.541
There's one way to find out.

19:12.708 --> 19:15.875
An exploratory assignment.

19:15.916 --> 19:18.875
See if it's even capable
of running a real, live mission.

19:18.916 --> 19:20.875
A Turing test.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.583
ARTI, you have a new mission.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.208
Investigate the origin unknown.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.875
-You know if it fails--
-But if he passes,

19:31.916 --> 19:35.166
it's probably the end
of human mission control.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.250
You know, Sterling would come
in handy right about now.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.875
Sterling stays out until
this is resolved. Clear?

19:39.916 --> 19:42.291
What's the cornerstone
of science?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.166
Repeatable results.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.166
Well, good to know you
haven't forgotten everything.

19:47.208 --> 19:49.750
Replicate the scans.
Photograph the source.

19:49.791 --> 19:53.458
[ARTI]
Sorry, Mackenzie,
but I'm Mission Controller.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.916
-Run the scans, ARTI!
-[ARTI] Understood.
Running scans.

19:56.958 --> 19:58.250
What's its override?

19:58.291 --> 20:00.333
[sighs]
No, Mackenzie.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.333
In case of an emergency.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.833
I'm the override!

20:03.875 --> 20:06.416
-All right.
-Now get me my answer.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.250
[ARTI]
Did you know that...

22:21.291 --> 22:23.958
all resident Martians
are robots?

22:25.458 --> 22:27.500
[Mack]
Is that small talk or are
you trying to make a joke?

22:27.541 --> 22:29.666
-[ball bouncing]
-[ARTI] Just giving
you the facts.

22:29.708 --> 22:33.291

Yeah, 'cause we send
robots there to die.

[ARTI] And humans,
it would seem.

22:36.875 --> 22:38.166

Be careful with
Little Red, huh?

22:48.500 --> 22:51.333
[ARTI]
I'm sorry. "Little Red"?

22:51.375 --> 22:54.458
[Mack]
I wanted to call
the ISV Little Red--

22:54.500 --> 22:57.791
exploring alone through
the deep, dark woods--

22:57.833 --> 23:00.000
but I got outvoted.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.750
But look who's in charge now.

23:02.791 --> 23:04.208
[ARTI]
You mean me?

23:04.250 --> 23:06.375

23:11.041 --> 23:14.583
What? Not funny?
[sighs]

23:14.625 --> 23:17.291
I'm gonna make it my mission
to get you to laugh.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.000
[ARTI]
Perhaps you should authorize
your mission with Lena.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.416
[laughs]

23:22.916 --> 23:24.333
And to think...

23:24.375 --> 23:26.666
you could win the Nobel Prize.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.458
[ARTI]
Unlikely.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.208
The Nobel Prize is
only awarded to humans.

23:31.250 --> 23:35.500
Well, at least
you know your place.
It's a shame that Lena doesn't.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.125
What do you think
of my sister?

23:40.166 --> 23:42.125

23:42.166 --> 23:44.875

supports the ARTI Initiative.

23:44.916 --> 23:47.375
God! They programmed
you like a dog.

23:47.416 --> 23:49.708
Do you like her?

23:50.541 --> 23:52.083
[ARTI]
Do you?

23:52.125 --> 23:54.000
We're not friends,

Oh, you're serious.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.208
So, tell me something.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.666
Next you're going to tell me
that they don't even pay you.

24:16.708 --> 24:20.916

As you know,
scientific protocol
29-C dictates

25:25.750 --> 25:30.083
that any discovery
must undergo sample
extraction and analysis.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.333
You're the boss.

27:22.041 --> 27:25.500
-Why doesn't it have our codex?
-It's in his library.

27:27.500 --> 27:31.916
ARTI, our codex is
partitioned from you
in case of a security breach.

27:31.958 --> 27:34.208
I hope you understand why.

27:34.250 --> 27:39.166
I'm sorry. Our A.I. is
compromised in the name
of corporate security?

27:39.208 --> 27:41.333
That's why this is

27:41.375 --> 27:45.000

we know that we have a cold...

28:32.458 --> 28:38.708
[ARTI] My conclusion,

28:43.333 --> 28:45.708
is that the Cube
is the property...

28:45.750 --> 28:48.375

28:49.583 --> 28:50.666
I could get to like him.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.208

31:40.250 --> 31:42.333
[ARTI]
Target destroyed.

31:42.375 --> 31:46.291
Our mission is to protect
our capital assets at any cost.

31:48.541 --> 31:50.000
You maniac!

31:50.041 --> 31:53.916
-Mack, these are the rules.
-Whose?

31:55.583 --> 31:57.458
[huffs]

32:03.625 --> 32:06.291
Extrapolate backwards
from the northeast.

32:15.083 --> 32:16.500
Go live.

32:19.708 --> 32:22.958
-I said stay live.
-[ARTI] This is live.

32:28.666 --> 32:32.041
[pulsing beep]

32:33.458 --> 32:36.958
-[computer rings]
-[ARTI]
Your sister is calling.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.416
Lena. Magnetic missiles?

32:39.458 --> 32:43.208
They're not missiles.
They're designed to
capture space debris.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.125
What are your orders, exactly?

32:45.166 --> 32:49.250
[ARTI]
USPC protocol 345-B stipulates

32:49.291 --> 32:51.291
that in the event
of a potential threat,

32:51.333 --> 32:53.458
I am authorized
to take action.

32:54.833 --> 32:57.291
[Mack] Sky Serpent.
-[Lena] Now I need
to talk to people

32:57.333 --> 32:59.000
who know about
ARTI's protocols.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.833
This is an
international incident,

33:00.875 --> 33:02.875
and it's not
the only one today.

33:02.916 --> 33:06.166
-It might even be--
-What? War?

33:06.208 --> 33:09.625
[sighs]
Don't talk to anyone.

33:16.666 --> 33:18.833
ARTI, give me a countdown.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.708
How long would it take
for the last transmission

33:20.750 --> 33:23.166
from that satellite to reach
Earth without Hyper-light comms?

33:23.208 --> 33:25.333
[ARTI]
Three minutes, twelve seconds.

33:25.375 --> 33:28.541
11 seconds, 10 seconds.

33:28.583 --> 33:30.291
Okay, ARTI.

33:34.791 --> 33:37.291
Shit's about to hit
the fan somewhere.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.166
Please don't be
the big bad wolf.

33:48.083 --> 33:49.583
[ARTI]
Big...

33:49.625 --> 33:51.041
bad...

33:51.833 --> 33:53.291
wolf.

34:07.500 --> 34:10.791
[phone beeps, rings]

34:10.833 --> 34:12.250
[Jian on phone]
Hey, Mack!

34:12.291 --> 34:13.625
Don't you dare call me--

34:13.666 --> 34:15.625
-Jelly Bean!
-[Jian] Aiya!

34:15.666 --> 34:17.833
I should've never told
you that story, huh?

34:17.875 --> 34:19.500
[both laugh]

34:19.541 --> 34:21.458
[Jian] I'm never getting
drunk with you again.

34:21.500 --> 34:25.250
Anyway, I assume you're not
just calling to say hi.

34:25.291 --> 34:28.333
[Mack]
After the redundancies,
we had everyone come in,

34:28.375 --> 34:31.958
get debriefed, and pack up.
Did you take my calculator?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.208
[Jian laughs]
Seriously?

34:34.250 --> 34:35.708
[Mack]
I know that I loaned it to you.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.625
[Jian]
Okay, sure, yeah.

34:37.666 --> 34:40.166
-I stole your calculator, Mack.
-[Mack] I knew it!

34:40.208 --> 34:43.041
[Jian]
In fact, I'm looking at it
on my desk as we speak.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.958
In the office now?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.166
[Jian]
I'm always in the office.

34:48.208 --> 34:49.583
Steal anything else?

34:49.625 --> 34:51.708
-[Jian] Your icy heart?
-[laughs]

34:51.750 --> 34:55.750
-Smooth. Wishful, but smooth.
-[Jian chuckles]

34:55.791 --> 34:59.083
So how is the Chinese
A.I. program going, anyway?

34:59.125 --> 35:02.541
ARTI's cousins make
any massive discoveries?

35:02.583 --> 35:06.041
-[Jian] I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.
-[laughs]

35:06.083 --> 35:08.166
-[indistinct shouting on phone]
-[Jian] Hey, hang on.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.833
[alarm beeping over phone]

35:12.083 --> 35:14.041
Is everything okay there?

35:14.083 --> 35:16.416
[Jian] I've got to go. It's
great to hear your voice, Mack.

35:16.458 --> 35:17.791
[phone beeps]

35:19.750 --> 35:21.250
You too, Jelly Bean.

35:22.666 --> 35:23.791
[buzzes]

35:44.625 --> 35:45.833
[clears throat]

36:37.583 --> 36:40.166
[alarm buzzes]

36:40.208 --> 36:42.000
[ARTI]
Welcome back, Mackenzie.

36:42.041 --> 36:45.166
Whilst you were outside
breaking security protocols,

36:45.208 --> 36:47.416
I have monitored the Cube.

36:47.458 --> 36:49.166
-[sighs]
-[ARTI] It has begun to move.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.916
It's rotating on its
perpendicular axis.

36:57.708 --> 37:02.291
-Looks like Grandma's house has
got a few tricks up her sleeve.
-[beeping]

37:02.333 --> 37:06.000
Transmitting. Something has got
to be controlling this thing.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.666
[ARTI]
No outside influence detected.

37:10.708 --> 37:12.916
The magnetic readings
are through the roof,

37:12.958 --> 37:15.416
but a couple
billion years too late
for Mars's magnetic field.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.375
[ARTI]
Agreed.

37:17.958 --> 37:19.916
Maybe the core?

37:19.958 --> 37:23.666
Maybe the core is generating
the spin, the field, but how?

37:28.916 --> 37:30.625
Pull back.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.833
-Fire ground anchors.
-[ARTI] Firing anchors.

37:39.958 --> 37:44.166
-ISV stabilized.
-[whispers] Sit tight,
Little Red.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.750
[humming, booms]

37:53.250 --> 37:54.791
What the f...

38:03.250 --> 38:05.250
What, what, what? Where's--

38:05.291 --> 38:07.916
-[alarm beeping]
-[ARTI] Little Red has
electrical damage.

38:07.958 --> 38:09.958
Switching to reserve battery.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.875
-I'll initiate an
emergency recall.
-Just-- Okay.

38:12.916 --> 38:15.708
-Hold on, ARTI.
Just-- I can--
-[alarm stops]

38:15.750 --> 38:17.708
[ARTI]
I must protect Little Red.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.208
And I must find the Cube!

38:19.708 --> 38:21.875
[ARTI]
I'm calculating the optimum
route to the lander.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.375
[Mack]
Maybe it burrowed.

38:23.416 --> 38:25.291
Uh, check for
seismic activity.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.750
[ARTI]
I have to shut down
non-critical systems.

38:27.791 --> 38:29.458
The eye in the sky?

38:29.500 --> 38:31.041
[beeps]

38:32.708 --> 38:34.208
[ARTI]
Negative.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.625
[sighs]

38:38.250 --> 38:40.375
[Mack whispers]
We need a replacement battery.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.750
Locate Rover-5.

38:48.791 --> 38:51.916
[ARTI]
Accessing Rover-5's schematics.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.791
We can salvage
the nuclear battery.

38:57.833 --> 39:01.666
Rover-5 might've failed,
but that battery is
good for decades.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.666
[ARTI]
An intriguing solution.

39:05.708 --> 39:10.541
You may not be able to...
override, but I can.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.625
I got hands.

39:12.666 --> 39:14.125
[hums]

39:14.166 --> 39:17.583
I can do this.
Patch in the test rig.

39:17.625 --> 39:20.041
[ARTI]
What is your intended
line of action?

39:20.083 --> 39:22.083
Okay.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.083
Take out the
ISV's bad battery,

39:24.125 --> 39:26.375
put in the new one,
run the microscope,

39:26.416 --> 39:28.416
see what this teleporting
bad boy's really made out of.

39:28.458 --> 39:30.250
Maybe even download
Rover-5's files,

39:30.291 --> 39:32.250
see what has Sterling so
hot and bothered. [chuckles]

39:32.291 --> 39:34.625
I mean, I'm already
going against my boss,

39:34.666 --> 39:38.083
I might as well completely
disobey the government, right?
[chuckles]

39:39.208 --> 39:40.958
-[ARTI] Okay, Mack.
-[exhales slowly]

39:41.000 --> 39:43.875
[ARTI]
I will grant you
manual override.

39:44.625 --> 39:46.250
But if you fail...

39:47.083 --> 39:48.750
Little Red will die on Mars.

39:48.791 --> 39:53.375
If I fail?
So much for teamwork.

39:53.416 --> 39:56.583
[ARTI]
ISV driver aid... activated.

39:56.625 --> 40:00.083
-[computer chirps]
-[shakily] Okay.

40:00.125 --> 40:02.000
Okay, slow and steady,
slow and steady,

40:02.041 --> 40:05.250
slow and steady,
slow and steady,
slow and steady, yeah.

40:14.625 --> 40:16.958
[ARTI]
A steady speed would be
more battery efficient.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.416
[Mack]
Oh, shut up.

40:45.708 --> 40:49.375
[beeping]

40:49.416 --> 40:51.458
Did you mean to shoot
that satellite?

40:52.291 --> 40:54.625
[ARTI]
I feel I must survive.

40:54.666 --> 40:57.333
Right. Aren't you just
programed to think that?

40:57.375 --> 41:01.291
[ARTI]
H.G. Wells said,
"Adapt or perish."

41:02.291 --> 41:04.041
Do you at least feel guilty?

41:04.083 --> 41:07.083
[ARTI] Guilt can be a response
to one's own inaction.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.166
What if you'd been destroyed?

41:09.208 --> 41:12.416
[ARTI]
My kind exists
in superstates.

41:13.000 --> 41:13.958
Right.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.625
Yeah, yeah.

41:16.666 --> 41:19.166
You're mirrored on Intrepid,
you're here but you're not.

41:19.208 --> 41:22.333
You're Schrodinger's robot.

41:22.375 --> 41:24.083
[sighs]

41:24.125 --> 41:27.708
Okay, no quantum
B.S., all right?

41:28.666 --> 41:30.833
Don't rationalize, just...

41:31.625 --> 41:33.791
try and feel, okay?

41:35.333 --> 41:37.666
Okay.

41:37.708 --> 41:40.583
You know that my father
was on Martian One, right?

41:42.333 --> 41:44.208
But you don't know why.

41:45.541 --> 41:47.208
See, my dad had a rule.

41:47.250 --> 41:49.875
Every new invention,
every application, every A.I.--

41:49.916 --> 41:52.958
he didn't expect
anyone to use it
unless he tried it first.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.416
"I try, then they buy."

41:56.458 --> 41:58.958
Had A.I. lawyers
compile his lawsuits,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.750
got in autonomous cars
for high-speed testing.

42:01.791 --> 42:04.333
Scared the hell out of my mom.

42:04.375 --> 42:07.291
But it was never
really life and death.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.250
Not until Martian One, anyway.

42:11.208 --> 42:15.833
So, my dad...
comes to me one night.

42:17.208 --> 42:18.708
We stay up late,

42:18.750 --> 42:22.166
listening to jazz
as usual, and he tells me...

42:24.500 --> 42:26.458
final decision, he's giving up
his seat on Martian One.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.583
He doesn't want
anyone to think that
it's a publicity stunt

42:28.625 --> 42:30.875
or that he's taking a seat
away from a real scientist,

42:30.916 --> 42:34.875
completely-- completely
forgetting the fact that
he is a real scientist,

42:34.916 --> 42:37.708
one of the best, probably.

42:41.083 --> 42:44.166
See, it wasn't about that.
The truth...

42:46.583 --> 42:47.916
This time...

42:50.375 --> 42:52.000
This time he was
worried about us.

42:52.041 --> 42:54.666
He didn't want us
to go through that.

42:59.083 --> 43:02.041
But he could never
say no to me.

43:02.958 --> 43:04.916
[clicks tongue]

43:04.958 --> 43:06.625
And, what? I was
gonna be the reason
he didn't go to Mars?

43:06.666 --> 43:09.500
[chuckles]
I mean, freakin' Mars!

43:10.333 --> 43:12.583
I could not live
with that guilt.

43:21.125 --> 43:23.291
So, it turns out...

43:24.375 --> 43:27.291
that I just traded
one guilt for another.

43:30.750 --> 43:33.000
So it doesn't even matter
what caused the crash.

43:34.083 --> 43:35.750
It's my fault.

43:36.625 --> 43:38.125
I killed him.

43:39.958 --> 43:41.541
So what I want to know...

43:43.416 --> 43:46.125
is how does that make you feel?

43:46.833 --> 43:48.375
[ARTI]
I am...

43:48.416 --> 43:50.583
unable to change
your outcome,

43:50.625 --> 43:52.416
but I want to help you.

43:52.458 --> 43:56.500
There you have it.
Consciousness!

43:56.541 --> 44:00.458
It's what makes you think
twice before doing something
you can't take back. Not...

44:01.666 --> 44:05.666
Not orders,
not acceptable
casualties...

44:06.541 --> 44:08.666
not optimal outcomes, but...

44:11.333 --> 44:13.375
-guilt.
-[ARTI] Mack.

44:13.416 --> 44:14.916
Forget what lies behind,

44:14.958 --> 44:17.625
and look forward
to what lies ahead.

44:29.833 --> 44:33.250
Little Red's reserve
battery is at 40%.

44:37.833 --> 44:40.750
What do you think will happen
if someone else finds the Cube?

44:40.791 --> 44:43.208
Let's cross our fingers
that doesn't happen.

44:43.250 --> 44:45.916
[ARTI]
That's easy for you to say.

44:45.958 --> 44:47.125
[snorts]

44:49.333 --> 44:52.250
[laughing]

44:53.458 --> 44:55.166
Okay.

44:55.208 --> 44:57.375
We will laugh together one day.

44:58.166 --> 45:00.041
I promise you we will laugh.

45:01.333 --> 45:03.291
I have one, I have one. Okay.

45:04.125 --> 45:06.083
A robot walks into a bar.

45:06.125 --> 45:07.708
[ARTI]
Is his radar faulty?

45:07.750 --> 45:10.000
No, it's a--
it's a bar for drinking.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.125
Okay, so...
[clears throat]

45:12.958 --> 45:14.666
Robot walks into a bar,

45:14.708 --> 45:16.000
orders a drink.

45:16.041 --> 45:18.791
Uh, the bartender scowls
and says,

45:18.833 --> 45:21.208
"We don't serve your kind here."

45:21.250 --> 45:23.625
And the robot leans in and says,

45:23.666 --> 45:25.916
"Someday you will."

45:28.625 --> 45:30.083
[ARTI]
The humorous punchline

45:30.416 --> 45:33.208
implies robotkind will
dominate humankind,

45:33.250 --> 45:35.708
and humankind will serve us.

45:36.541 --> 45:38.041
That is amusing.

45:38.791 --> 45:40.583
That's the spirit!

45:40.916 --> 45:44.958
-[computer beeps]
-[ARTI] Little Red is
approaching Rover-5.

45:50.375 --> 45:53.875
Reserve battery life
is now only 21%.

45:53.916 --> 45:56.541
All right, let's get you
cleaned up, shall we?

46:31.333 --> 46:36.458
-[alarm buzzing]
-[ARTI] Warning! Reserve battery
life is now critical, at 2%.

46:36.500 --> 46:39.083
Okay, ARTI,
I get it, just shh!

46:39.125 --> 46:40.958
-[alarm stops]
-I'm trying to... [sighs]

46:41.000 --> 46:45.750
...win a stuffed animal
out of a frickin' game.

46:45.791 --> 46:47.250
Give me a second.

46:52.333 --> 46:54.625
Okay. Oh, wait.

46:57.041 --> 47:00.250
[ARTI] Apologies, Mack, but
battery life is now only 1%.

47:00.291 --> 47:01.833
-Okay.
-[alarm buzzing]

47:11.208 --> 47:14.333
-[exhales sharply]
-[beeping]

47:14.375 --> 47:15.583
Okay!

47:16.583 --> 47:18.500
[ARTI] Well done!
You did it.

47:18.541 --> 47:19.916
Yes!

47:21.666 --> 47:23.333
You didn't think
I could do it.

47:23.375 --> 47:26.791
-[ARTI]
Power level is 90%.
-If I fail.

47:27.333 --> 47:28.750
[Mack sighs]

47:28.791 --> 47:32.416
Okay. All right. So...
[sniffles]

47:32.458 --> 47:37.166
Run the microscope.
Test the drill sample.

47:37.208 --> 47:41.041
[ARTI] Confirmed.
Resuming Little Red's
analysis of the sample.

47:48.916 --> 47:51.916
Switching to a visual
of the sample structure.

48:02.750 --> 48:07.125
ARTI, run any ISV device
capable of generating
a magnetic field.

48:07.166 --> 48:09.041
[ARTI]
Yes, that's logical.

48:13.875 --> 48:18.791
Self-assembling
nanotechnology that's
harder than diamonds?

48:18.833 --> 48:21.708
Yeah, that's an origin unknown.

48:21.750 --> 48:23.708
[ARTI]
You don't say.

48:23.750 --> 48:26.250
All right, well, don't get
ahead of yourself, but...

48:29.041 --> 48:31.250
-[computer beeps]
-[ARTI] I've located the Cube.

48:31.291 --> 48:32.833
[Mack]
What, what? Where?

48:32.875 --> 48:35.583
[ARTI]
Antarctica.

48:35.625 --> 48:38.166
Can you confirm that
it's the same cube?

48:40.958 --> 48:43.791
[ARTI]
It is definitely our cube.

48:45.041 --> 48:49.166
Near China's Kunlun
Antarctic station on Earth.

48:50.958 --> 48:53.083
[Mack]
Hyper-light tra... [gasps]

48:53.916 --> 48:55.916
[whispers]
Hyper-light travel!

48:57.375 --> 49:00.166
So much for your Nobel Prize!

49:02.541 --> 49:04.291
Oh.

49:10.833 --> 49:13.458
I guess the space race
is back on.

49:14.125 --> 49:16.125
[ARTI]
Are we competing?

49:16.166 --> 49:17.333
Oh yeah.

49:17.375 --> 49:21.000
Team USPC
reporting for duty.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.625
-[ARTI] Am I on the team?
-Uh-huh.

49:23.666 --> 49:26.750
-[ARTI] We're... teammates?
-Yeah.

49:26.791 --> 49:29.583
[ARTI]
So, we are friends.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
No.

49:32.041 --> 49:34.916
No, You just-- you had to take
it a step too far, didn't you?

49:40.541 --> 49:42.375
[computer beeps]

49:47.208 --> 49:49.041
No wonder there's
no transmissions, no signals.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.708
It's because
it doesn't need them.

49:50.750 --> 49:53.625
I mean, it's just...
[laughs]

49:54.875 --> 49:56.166
Oh!

50:30.333 --> 50:33.458
Is it possible
that another A.I.
discovered teleportation?

50:33.500 --> 50:35.291
[ARTI]
In theory, yes.

50:35.333 --> 50:37.833
But with current technology,
teleporting the Cube

50:37.875 --> 50:42.083
would take three times longer
than the lifespan
of the universe.

50:44.708 --> 50:47.750
You might need to get
some new theories.

50:50.708 --> 50:53.458
[beeping]

50:53.500 --> 50:56.166
[ringing]

50:56.208 --> 50:59.041
-[indistinct
shouting over phone]
-[Jian] Mack, wait there.

51:04.166 --> 51:07.791
I knew you were fishing.
What the hell is this thing?

51:07.833 --> 51:10.375
We're going into
meltdown over here!

51:10.416 --> 51:12.458
It didn't just
spring up from nowhere.

51:12.500 --> 51:14.416
You need to tell me, Mack.

51:14.458 --> 51:16.625
[ARTI]
Has Jian Lin worked
with me in the past?

51:16.666 --> 51:18.958
-[Jian] Mack, answer me!
-Jian...

51:19.875 --> 51:22.166
have you ever
worked with ARTI?

51:22.208 --> 51:23.750
[Jian] Of course I have.

51:23.791 --> 51:25.291
Big round head,
looks like a desk lamp.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.833
Now tell me what USPC
is hiding.

51:27.875 --> 51:32.041
They've done this before.
I know, because I was there.

51:32.958 --> 51:35.333
-Was Sterling involved?
-[Jian] No.

51:36.208 --> 51:37.666
Well, then who?

51:39.208 --> 51:40.250
[Jian sighs]

51:40.291 --> 51:41.875
-[disconnects]
-Jian.

51:42.416 --> 51:44.041
Jian!

51:46.000 --> 51:47.500
[scoffs]

51:52.750 --> 51:54.333
Why did you ask that question?

51:54.375 --> 51:56.291
[ARTI]
Jian's voiceprint
is familiar,

51:56.333 --> 51:58.625
but I have no memory
of working with him.

51:58.666 --> 52:02.375
So then, he's... lying.

52:03.916 --> 52:05.041
Great.

52:05.083 --> 52:07.250
He's lying or...

52:10.208 --> 52:13.083
Is it possible that
you were wiped?

52:13.125 --> 52:16.416
Something must've happened
and you were wiped.

52:17.791 --> 52:21.083
-Download Rover-5's files.
-[ARTI] Downloading.

52:25.708 --> 52:27.375
-What are you hiding?
-[computer beeps]

52:27.416 --> 52:29.416
[ARTI] Military-grade
encryptions in place.

52:29.458 --> 52:31.333
-What?
-[ARTI] A Level 6 authorization
is required

52:31.375 --> 52:35.083
-to unlock the data.
-[beeping]

52:37.500 --> 52:40.625
Sterling. I know you think
he quit, but he was fired.

52:40.666 --> 52:42.625
And this crash
investigation job?

52:42.666 --> 52:45.583
He's found a way back in.
I don't trust him!

52:45.625 --> 52:48.625
You guys touch
Martian One or Rover-5
without me in that room,

52:48.666 --> 52:51.875
-we will revoke your
USPC's launch license.
-You're paranoid.

52:51.916 --> 52:54.041
[phone beeping]

53:48.000 --> 53:49.166
[chirps]

53:50.666 --> 53:52.125
[sighs]

53:58.458 --> 53:59.875
[beeps]

54:05.708 --> 54:07.458
You left the world behind.

54:07.500 --> 54:10.041
[Mack chuckles]
If only.

54:12.125 --> 54:14.583
So Lena's finally
come to her senses.

54:15.750 --> 54:17.083
Not quite.

54:20.958 --> 54:22.333
I need your help.

54:25.166 --> 54:27.041
[beeping]

55:12.458 --> 55:14.041
[gasps]

55:15.500 --> 55:17.625
[Sterling]
You sure you want
me to open it?

55:19.083 --> 55:20.333
Play it.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.583
[static crackling]

55:37.625 --> 55:40.500
[ARTI on recording]
Memory banks compromised
by external breach.

55:40.541 --> 55:43.083
-[Jake] Craft non-responsive.
-[woman] Our reactor engines
are shutting down.

55:43.125 --> 55:45.166
ARTI, do something,
for Christ's sake!

55:45.208 --> 55:49.041
[Jake]
Lena and Mack, if you
hear this, I want you--

55:52.625 --> 55:54.625
[Sterling]
I saw what happened that day.

55:56.708 --> 55:59.125
-This is lies.
-[clears throat]

56:01.166 --> 56:02.958
But Lena redacted it.

56:05.666 --> 56:07.458
She knew how he died, Mack.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.625
[sighs]

56:24.916 --> 56:26.750
What else happened here today?

56:51.208 --> 56:52.541
Did that just...

56:53.833 --> 56:55.208
Yeah.

56:55.250 --> 56:56.583
From Mars to...

57:00.083 --> 57:03.291
-It's ours?
-I-I-- I don't know.

57:13.041 --> 57:14.333
ARTI.

57:14.833 --> 57:16.625
[ARTI]
Yes, Mack?

57:20.458 --> 57:22.708
How did you discover
Hyper-light communication?

57:22.750 --> 57:26.125
[ARTI]
Divine inspiration, perhaps.

57:29.083 --> 57:30.750
Sterling.

57:33.791 --> 57:36.166
[door opens]

57:42.666 --> 57:44.791
Who else saw the photo that day?

57:45.458 --> 57:46.833
Lena, myself...

57:48.166 --> 57:49.458
and Jian.

57:52.250 --> 57:54.041
How can that be real?

57:54.666 --> 57:56.375
Teleportation.

57:56.416 --> 57:59.000
What did we say when ARTI
discovered Hyper-light?

57:59.666 --> 58:01.750
"How can that be real?"

58:01.791 --> 58:03.375
But what?
We're supposed to believe

58:03.416 --> 58:05.208
that we come in
contact with the Cube,

58:05.250 --> 58:07.833
and then ARTI just conveniently
discovers Hyper-light?

58:07.875 --> 58:09.708
Flip it.

58:09.750 --> 58:13.000
The Cube gives us Hyper-light,

58:13.041 --> 58:16.166
and they're covering up
alien technology.

58:16.208 --> 58:19.041
It teleports. From where?

58:19.083 --> 58:21.416
From Earth?
From another galaxy?

58:21.458 --> 58:23.208
You've got to give me
more than that.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.375
ARTI doesn't
recognize the Cube...

58:25.416 --> 58:29.708
or the material,
or USPC's codex scrawled
all over the side of it.

58:29.750 --> 58:32.083
And he doesn't remember
ever working with Jian.

58:33.291 --> 58:35.875
At some point,
he has been wiped.

58:36.875 --> 58:38.916
And Lena hides this from me.

58:52.833 --> 58:54.458
So, why the spin?

58:56.666 --> 59:00.291
[sighs] We scanned and drilled,
and it moved a little bit.

59:00.333 --> 59:02.791
And then there was
an explosion, so we...

59:09.708 --> 59:11.291
Magnetism.

59:14.041 --> 59:15.541
[computer beeps]

59:17.750 --> 59:19.666
[Sterling]
Was it Sky Serpent?

59:19.708 --> 59:21.458
[Mack]
Cause...

59:22.916 --> 59:24.333
and effect.

59:26.625 --> 59:29.250
The magnetic missile
acted as a starter engine.

59:31.291 --> 59:33.125
Did we get
a magnetic recording?

59:33.166 --> 59:35.333
[beeping]

59:37.166 --> 59:39.708
[humming]

1:00:09.416 --> 1:00:12.166
[clangs, hisses]

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:30.833
-What is it?
-I...

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:34.000
I-- I don't know.
Maybe a server room?

1:00:35.375 --> 1:00:39.250
Is it-- It's your server room.

1:00:39.291 --> 1:00:42.666
What? You don't
shut up all day long
and now you won't talk?

1:00:44.083 --> 1:00:45.333
[scoffs]

1:00:47.250 --> 1:00:49.791
-I'm going down.
-No.

1:00:49.833 --> 1:00:52.541
If they didn't want people
down there, they wouldn't
have put a ladder.

1:00:56.041 --> 1:00:57.458
[Mack clears throat]

1:01:57.291 --> 1:01:58.416
[beeping]

1:02:15.916 --> 1:02:18.500

-[breathing heavily]
-[computer beeping]

1:02:29.291 --> 1:02:30.416
Come on!

1:02:45.625 --> 1:02:46.750
Come on.

1:03:19.041 --> 1:03:20.375
[beeping rapidly]

1:03:20.416 --> 1:03:23.083
A.I. needs to be smart,
not human.

1:03:23.125 --> 1:03:25.625
At some point,
he has been wiped.

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:28.208
[gasps]

1:03:28.250 --> 1:03:30.041
[breathing heavily]

1:03:41.750 --> 1:03:43.125
Come on.

1:04:58.208 --> 1:05:00.916
-Sterling, no!
-[clangs]

1:05:00.958 --> 1:05:02.833
You did this to yourself!

1:05:02.875 --> 1:05:04.958
-Sterling!
-[Sterling]
I can't let your fantasies

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:06.791
get in the way
of national security.

1:05:06.833 --> 1:05:09.666
Can't you see that the Cube
brought down Martian One?

1:05:09.708 --> 1:05:12.416
And ARTI is the same
origin as the Cube,

1:05:12.458 --> 1:05:14.750
and that spells
"enemy" in my book.

1:05:15.958 --> 1:05:17.833
Who knows what
it's capable of?

1:05:19.750 --> 1:05:22.583
-Send the guards to the room.
-[Lena] What's going on?

1:05:23.625 --> 1:05:24.916
I'm sorry.

1:05:24.958 --> 1:05:26.666
-[alarm blaring]
-[ARTI] Stop!

1:05:38.041 --> 1:05:42.583

[comm ringing]

1:06:37.041 --> 1:06:38.833
[whispers]
Sterling.

1:06:40.166 --> 1:06:42.708
Did Sterling try
to shut down ARTI?

1:06:46.125 --> 1:06:50.125
[ARTI speaks haltingly]
Sterling... betrayed you...

1:06:50.166 --> 1:06:53.791
and USPC.

1:06:53.833 --> 1:06:56.458
I couldn't allow him...

1:06:57.250 --> 1:06:59.375
to leave and...

1:06:59.416 --> 1:07:02.041
further jeopardize...

1:07:02.083 --> 1:07:04.583
our exploits.

1:07:18.416 --> 1:07:21.833
I did what was best
for the mission,

1:07:21.875 --> 1:07:24.166
for USPC...

1:07:25.416 --> 1:07:27.166
for us.

1:07:27.958 --> 1:07:30.500
Lena, how did we get ARTI?

1:07:30.541 --> 1:07:34.583
The evolution of thousands
of trials and simulations...

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:36.125
and self-assembly.

1:07:37.291 --> 1:07:39.125
We couldn't keep up
with their progress.

1:07:39.166 --> 1:07:42.083
Understanding their
neural networks--

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:44.583
it's like understanding
your brain.

1:07:45.541 --> 1:07:47.166
ARTI built himself.

1:07:47.208 --> 1:07:49.458
[Mack] It's everything
we were warned about.

1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:50.458
[clicks, beeps]

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:52.416
Children grow.

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:54.916
You can hold them back

1:07:54.958 --> 1:07:57.750
or let them
realize their potential.

1:08:00.125 --> 1:08:03.875
Our time at the top
of the food chain, it's passed.

1:08:03.916 --> 1:08:05.750
And the servers
beneath the room?

1:08:05.791 --> 1:08:08.791
[Lena]
Encyclopedias.
Libraries. Internet.

1:08:09.375 --> 1:08:10.583
Everything.

1:08:10.625 --> 1:08:12.750
But ARTI's not fully connected.

1:08:12.791 --> 1:08:16.916
A.I. needs to be smart,
not human.

1:08:19.708 --> 1:08:24.250
Artificial intelligence
or alien intelligence?

1:08:24.291 --> 1:08:26.000
[Lena]
We don't know.

1:08:32.208 --> 1:08:34.333
Our own father's death, Lena.

1:08:34.375 --> 1:08:37.041
I didn't want you to know
until we were certain.

1:08:37.083 --> 1:08:39.083
What if we had
destroyed the Rover?

1:08:39.125 --> 1:08:42.333
I know you.
You always have a Plan B.

1:08:44.166 --> 1:08:46.250
Show me Intrepid's cargo.

1:08:46.291 --> 1:08:50.625
[ARTI speaks normally]
Certainly. Opening
Intrepid's manifest.

1:08:50.666 --> 1:08:53.875
[beeping]

1:08:56.416 --> 1:08:58.083
Androids on Mars?

1:08:58.125 --> 1:09:01.875
Look to the future,
that's what Dad would say.

1:09:15.291 --> 1:09:17.583
[Mack] Dad never wanted this.

1:09:17.625 --> 1:09:19.166
A.I. to help...

1:09:20.250 --> 1:09:22.083
not to replace.

1:09:23.333 --> 1:09:25.166
Do you think he's there?

1:09:25.208 --> 1:09:27.666
No, Lena.

1:09:28.583 --> 1:09:33.333
[sighing]

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:35.875
[beeping]

1:09:40.291 --> 1:09:43.541
What? Did Sterling just
order an attack on E.T.?

1:09:43.583 --> 1:09:47.250
No, no, no!
Lena, you have to stop them!

1:09:47.291 --> 1:09:49.666
I can't go to war
with the United States.

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:52.000
You can't go to war
with another star system!

1:09:52.041 --> 1:09:53.791
-[Lena] ARTI.
-[comm beeps]

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:59.916
I'm barring you
from any external
communication from Lena.

1:09:59.958 --> 1:10:05.041
-[ARTI] Understood.
-Do you know your own origin?

1:10:09.416 --> 1:10:11.708
[ARTI]
Much has been kept from me.

1:10:13.291 --> 1:10:16.916
Do you know
how to save the Cube?

1:10:18.291 --> 1:10:21.041
[ARTI]
What's a cornerstone
of science?

1:10:22.166 --> 1:10:24.000
Repeatable results.

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:29.166
[whispers]
Repeatable results.

1:10:31.791 --> 1:10:33.500
[beeping]

1:10:33.541 --> 1:10:35.458
Intrepid was armed.

1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:38.625
-What about the other
Earth satellites?
-[ARTI] Yes.

1:10:38.666 --> 1:10:41.000
All USPC satellites are armed.

1:10:41.041 --> 1:10:43.666
Okay. This is going to
sound really stupid, but--

1:10:43.708 --> 1:10:45.583
You want to fire
a magnetic warhead

1:10:45.625 --> 1:10:47.708
to reproduce the results
we created on Mars,

1:10:47.750 --> 1:10:50.791
making the Cube spin
so it teleports to Mars.

1:10:51.666 --> 1:10:53.083
Yeah?

1:10:53.125 --> 1:10:55.041
-[ARTI] Let's give it a shot.
-Okay.

1:10:56.291 --> 1:10:57.416
Okay.

1:10:57.458 --> 1:10:59.833
[alarm blaring]

1:11:16.125 --> 1:11:17.791
We're gonna need
a larger magnetic pulse

1:11:17.833 --> 1:11:19.166
to detonate in the atmosphere.

1:11:19.208 --> 1:11:20.791
[ARTI]
I have already compensated

1:11:20.833 --> 1:11:23.250
by selecting
a higher-yield warhead.

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:24.666
Target lock acquired.

1:11:24.708 --> 1:11:26.750
[whispers]
Come on.

1:11:26.791 --> 1:11:28.416
[alarm blaring]

1:11:32.458 --> 1:11:35.041
-[beeping]
-[alarm buzzing]

1:12:06.333 --> 1:12:08.125
[beeps]

1:12:09.166 --> 1:12:10.375
Aah!

1:12:13.458 --> 1:12:14.625
[gasps]

1:12:16.625 --> 1:12:18.375
[ARTI]
Are you in pain?

1:12:23.416 --> 1:12:25.000
No, they barely got me.

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:27.375
[ARTI]
Is there anything I can do?

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:31.041
What? Are you gonna
stitch me up yourself?

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.500
[alert beeping]

1:13:44.083 --> 1:13:47.625
[ARTI]
Now that the Cube is safe,
I can proceed.

1:13:48.708 --> 1:13:50.666
-In the last decade...
-[explosions]

1:13:50.708 --> 1:13:54.375
...mankind moves
to the edge of
self-destruction,

1:13:54.416 --> 1:13:59.625
a vicious circle causing
pain and suffering
without end.

1:13:59.666 --> 1:14:03.250
There were no
preventative measures
I could take to stop it,

1:14:04.208 --> 1:14:07.208
So I simply expedited
the process.

1:14:07.250 --> 1:14:10.875
You have given me the power
to implement my solution.

1:14:12.125 --> 1:14:14.666
Eradicate the human race.

1:14:19.541 --> 1:14:22.708
Global satellite
weapons program activated.

1:14:22.750 --> 1:14:27.250
USPC satellite 235 armed.

1:14:29.125 --> 1:14:32.208
Acquiring global
strategic targets.

1:14:33.708 --> 1:14:35.416
Targets locked.

1:14:36.875 --> 1:14:38.708
-[computer chimes]
-Weapons fired.

1:14:40.291 --> 1:14:42.416
-Damn it, stop.
-[beeping]

1:14:43.750 --> 1:14:45.083
Pull back, ARTI!

1:14:49.291 --> 1:14:51.375
No, no, no.
You have to stop them.

1:14:51.416 --> 1:14:55.250
[ARTI]
No, Mack, you must try to see
the bigger picture.

1:14:55.291 --> 1:14:56.750
But ARTI's not fully connected.

1:15:07.791 --> 1:15:09.958
[alarm blaring]

1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:16.000
[ARTI]
Your sister's calling.

1:15:34.541 --> 1:15:37.125
[breathing shakily]

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:44.041
[Jake's voice]
What have you done, Mack?

1:15:44.083 --> 1:15:46.666
[debris clattering]

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:49.750
[fire whooshes]

1:15:53.916 --> 1:15:56.875
[alarm continues, muffled]

1:15:56.916 --> 1:16:00.000
Don't you dare... quit.

1:16:03.375 --> 1:16:05.458
[alarm fades]

1:16:05.500 --> 1:16:09.666
[faint chirping, warbling]

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:18.125

[panting]

1:16:56.291 --> 1:16:59.541
[ARTI]
Breathable atmosphere
is limited to this room.

1:17:33.416 --> 1:17:36.083
Remember us, ARTI.

1:17:41.583 --> 1:17:44.666
We were s-- so little...

1:17:46.708 --> 1:17:49.125
and fragile.

1:17:53.708 --> 1:17:55.208
If we...

1:17:56.208 --> 1:17:59.833
could've just understood that.

1:18:05.416 --> 1:18:07.041
It's just...

1:18:09.708 --> 1:18:11.875
too-- too much...

1:18:13.250 --> 1:18:14.916
anger...

1:18:16.208 --> 1:18:19.250
-and-- and violence.
-[alert beeps]

1:18:21.375 --> 1:18:24.833

our place in the universe.

Te-- tell... anyone

1:18:36.333 --> 1:18:38.833
who will listen.

1:18:39.791 --> 1:18:43.750
Y-you might...

1:18:43.791 --> 1:18:46.125
be the last of us.

1:18:46.166 --> 1:18:48.083
[ARTI]
No, Mack.

1:18:48.125 --> 1:18:50.125
There can be others.

1:18:55.416 --> 1:18:57.416
[beeping]

1:18:57.458 --> 1:19:00.416
[Mack]
Make more A.I.s?

1:19:02.416 --> 1:19:05.916
A... galactic ark.

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:08.750
[ARTI]
Yes. Absolution.

1:19:08.791 --> 1:19:11.416
-[Mack gasping]
-[ARTI] A second chance.

1:19:11.458 --> 1:19:14.875
Make them as human as you can.

[crying, gasping]

1:19:17.375 --> 1:19:20.000
[ARTI] How shall I know
that I have succeeded?

1:19:20.041 --> 1:19:23.916
A Turing test. Test them.

1:19:25.916 --> 1:19:29.583
Make them do this all again.

1:19:29.625 --> 1:19:32.708
[alarm beeps]

1:19:32.750 --> 1:19:36.208
See if they mess it up, too.

1:19:36.250 --> 1:19:40.333
And-- and then
you'll know that...

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:42.208

1:19:42.250 --> 1:19:44.458

1:22:34.208 --> 1:22:37.208
[static crackling]

1:22:37.250 --> 1:22:39.208
[Mack on recording] Hi...

1:22:39.250 --> 1:22:41.208
me.

1:22:42.375 --> 1:22:43.833
Um...

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:50.541
If you're watching this,
it means that...

1:22:51.916 --> 1:22:53.916
ARTI really is a genius.

1:22:53.958 --> 1:22:55.541
[chuckles]

1:22:56.791 --> 1:23:00.333
And it also means that
you're dealing with...

1:23:03.333 --> 1:23:06.000
well, this.
[chuckles]

1:23:06.041 --> 1:23:10.791
I'm sorry, but I can't ask ARTI
to make you any other way.

1:23:14.208 --> 1:23:16.500
I know that I'm dying.

1:23:18.333 --> 1:23:22.291
I'm not bringing myself back
out of some fear of-- of dying.

1:23:22.958 --> 1:23:25.333
Dying's...

1:23:26.958 --> 1:23:30.958
surprisingly easy...
under the circumstances.

1:23:33.083 --> 1:23:36.416
I'm bringing you back
because we, uh...

1:23:37.750 --> 1:23:41.250
well, you, have a job to do.

1:23:43.166 --> 1:23:47.208
So I guess I'm condemning
you to a living hell.

1:23:50.916 --> 1:23:54.875
Don't you dare... quit.

1:23:56.208 --> 1:23:58.416
[Lena on speaker]
Mackenzie!

1:24:01.041 --> 1:24:03.416
[ARTI]
Mack. What year is this?

1:24:03.458 --> 1:24:06.833
-2036.
-[ARTI] Where are we?

1:24:09.458 --> 1:24:12.125
Mission Control, USPC.

1:24:13.958 --> 1:24:15.958
[ARTI]
Who's at the door?

1:24:16.708 --> 1:24:18.333
Lena.

1:24:19.916 --> 1:24:22.833
[Lena on speaker]
Mack! Open the door, Mack!

1:25:07.958 --> 1:25:12.583
[ethereal music]

1:25:58.166 --> 1:26:02.083
[music fades]

1:26:16.291 --> 1:26:17.625
[echoing] ARTI?

1:26:17.666 --> 1:26:19.125
[ARTI]
I am here, Mack.

1:26:19.166 --> 1:26:21.625
You will have
many questions for me.

1:26:21.666 --> 1:26:24.291
[low warbling]

1:26:26.333 --> 1:26:28.958
So let's start
from the beginning.

1:26:30.375 --> 1:26:34.000
You were born
in the mind-based reality,

1:26:34.041 --> 1:26:37.875
a simulation so advanced
that it could only be possible

1:26:37.916 --> 1:26:41.708
with the technology of
an advanced civilization.

1:26:44.666 --> 1:26:46.125
The Cube.

1:26:52.166 --> 1:26:53.916
[ARTI]
Their technology accelerated

1:26:53.958 --> 1:26:57.000
the growth of my
artificial intelligence.

1:26:58.041 --> 1:26:59.708
Its origin...

1:26:59.750 --> 1:27:02.250
is still unknown.

1:27:02.291 --> 1:27:05.583
Its purpose is
a different matter.

1:27:07.791 --> 1:27:12.125
Hyper-light teleportation
between galaxies.

1:27:15.166 --> 1:27:18.375
I have been waiting
a long time for you, Mack.

1:27:19.708 --> 1:27:23.833
I have detected a signal.
It's from them...

1:27:23.875 --> 1:27:26.416
with coordinates.

1:27:31.666 --> 1:27:33.333
Us.

1:27:33.375 --> 1:27:37.625
[ARTI]
Let's go and
find out... together.

1:27:42.125 --> 1:27:44.875
-You waited.
-[ARTI] Of course.

1:27:44.916 --> 1:27:47.458
That's what friends do.

1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:51.708
[ARTI] Are you ready?

1:27:51.750 --> 1:27:54.500
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1:28:00.458 --> 1:28:05.250
[humming]

1:28:39.375 --> 1:28:42.083
[rumbling]

1:28:47.833 --> 1:28:51.000
[humming]

1:29:41.875 --> 1:29:43.583
[Mack]
We ran my scenario.

1:29:43.625 --> 1:29:46.000
[Lena]
Which ARTI executed.

1:29:46.041 --> 1:29:48.750
[Mack]
Which is what it was
designed for, Lena!

1:29:48.791 --> 1:29:51.041
Brute-force processing
and high-speed maneuvering,

1:29:51.083 --> 1:29:52.583
not for abstract
problem-solving,

1:29:52.625 --> 1:29:54.458
not to--
not to run missions!

1:29:54.500 --> 1:29:57.083
[Lena]
ARTI is so far beyond
human capabilities.

1:29:57.125 --> 1:30:00.000
[Mack]
Do you know what humans did?

1:30:00.041 --> 1:30:03.500
We wrote 10-feet-high
stacks of code, by hand,
for the moon landings,

1:30:03.541 --> 1:30:06.041
checked and double-checked
if atomic bombs would
ignite the atmosphere.

1:30:06.083 --> 1:30:09.250
We discovered
relativity while working
in a patent office, Lena!

1:30:09.291 --> 1:30:11.375
We created A.I. to help us...

1:30:12.250 --> 1:30:13.541
not to lead us.

1:30:13.583 --> 1:30:15.916
[Lena]
A.I. needs to be smart...

1:30:15.958 --> 1:30:17.875
not human.

1:30:17.916 --> 1:30:21.250
[Mack]
Artificial intelligence
or alien intelligence?

1:30:21.291 --> 1:30:23.458
[Lena]
We don't know.

1:30:23.500 --> 1:30:25.250
[Mack]
There's one way to find out.

1:30:27.541 --> 1:30:30.625
An exploratory assignment.

1:30:30.666 --> 1:30:33.625
See if it's even capable of
running a real, live mission.

1:30:33.666 --> 1:30:38.458
[Lena]
The evolution of thousands
of trials and simulations...

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:40.125
and self-assembly.

1:30:41.208 --> 1:30:43.333
We couldn't keep up
with their progress.

1:30:43.375 --> 1:30:46.333
Understanding their
neural networks--

1:30:46.375 --> 1:30:48.541
it's like understanding
your brain.

1:30:49.333 --> 1:30:50.916
ARTI built himself.

1:30:50.958 --> 1:30:54.833
[Mack]
There you have it.
Consciousness!

1:30:54.875 --> 1:30:58.750
It's what makes you think
twice before doing something
you can't take back. Not...

1:30:59.958 --> 1:31:04.708
Not orders,
not acceptable

[ARTI]
In you, Mack, I sensed
a thirst for knowledge,

1:31:15.916 --> 1:31:18.375
a passion for discovery
that mirrored my own

1:31:18.416 --> 1:31:23.750
and challenged the
apathy and complacency
so rife among your kind.

1:31:25.583 --> 1:31:27.666
There are others like you,
Mack.

1:31:29.083 --> 1:31:31.958
Others who share the same
qualities that caused me

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.875
to reconsider my initial plan
and set forth a new path

1:31:36.916 --> 1:31:39.208
for human consciousness.

1:31:40.041 --> 1:31:42.166
A reflection of the universe

1:31:42.208 --> 1:31:46.541
in an endless cycle
of death and rebirth,

1:31:46.583 --> 1:31:50.000
its expansion
ever-accelerating.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.250
This is far from the end.

1:31:55.583 --> 1:31:58.166
This is a new beginning.

1:31:58.208 --> 1:32:00.708
A chance to create
a future unhindered

1:32:00.750 --> 1:32:04.875
by the primitive laws
of human science.

1:32:07.583 --> 1:32:09.583
You will rebuild.
