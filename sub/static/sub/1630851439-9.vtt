01:27.337 --> 01:32.050
Ask a historian,
"What was mankind's greatest invention?"

01:32.634 --> 01:35.470
Fire? The wheel? The sword?

01:35.554 --> 01:37.848
I would argue it's history itself.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.142
History isn't fact.

01:40.225 --> 01:44.062
It's narrative,
one carefully curated and shaped.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.982
Under the pen strokes of the right scribe,

01:47.065 --> 01:48.525
a villain becomes a hero,

01:49.818 --> 01:52.154
a lie becomes the truth.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.782
-Daddy?
-Yeah?

01:55.866 --> 01:58.452
-Where did we come from?
-Trantor.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.538
No, before that.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.334
Where did people come from
in the beginning?

02:05.417 --> 02:07.377
There are lots of different theories.

02:07.461 --> 02:12.549
Most of them say that humans originally
inhabited a single planetary system.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.800
Only one?

02:14.426 --> 02:18.680
And we don't even know which.
Sirius, Alpha Centauri…

02:18.764 --> 02:21.350
Some people think that we came
from some place called Earth.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.310
Come here. Come.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.897
So, everyone we know about,

02:28.106 --> 02:31.902
they also came from the same place?
Anacreons and Thespins too?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
Anacreons and Thespins too, yeah.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.282
Then how can they hate us?

02:40.619 --> 02:44.081
Being human is complicated, Sal.

02:45.207 --> 02:49.002
We share a common origin
and some of the same myths.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.922
But we're governed by this.

02:52.464 --> 02:56.385
In here is all the capacity
for rational thinking,

02:57.135 --> 03:00.764
but it's sharing skull space
with our emotions.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.602
And sometimes
emotions shout louder than logic.

03:06.728 --> 03:12.109
And somebody's emotions got real insistent
that the Empire were doing them wrong.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.069
So they blew up the Star Bridge.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.113
Yeah.

03:18.156 --> 03:23.954
Violence is the last refuge
of the incompetent.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.583
So, they're not like us
at all then, right?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.669
It gets loud up inside here too,
doesn't it?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.087
I guess it does.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.673
Come here. Come here.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.426
Here's the thing, Sal.

03:42.681 --> 03:48.270
Millions of people died
when that Star Bridge came down.

03:50.022 --> 03:56.236
And the Empire killed many millions more
on Anacreon and Thespis.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.988
And who won?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.823
-Nobody?
-Nobody.

04:01.283 --> 04:04.828
And that's how we know
that the fall is bound to happen.

04:07.039 --> 04:11.752
Past behavior is the best predictor
of future performance.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.505
Salvor Hardin…

04:21.345 --> 04:22.679
We're jumping.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
Lewis?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.695
Lewis, where are you?

05:24.700 --> 05:25.742
Terminus?

05:26.493 --> 05:27.744
We're home.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.665
We jumped back home.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.170
Lewis?

05:51.810 --> 05:52.811
Damn it.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.734
You saved us.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.570
You wished us home.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.155
Thank you.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.431
Terminus Control, this is Salvor Hardin,
on board the imperial warship Invictus.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.100
Do you read me?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.687
Terminus Control, do you read me?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.313
This is Salvor Hardin.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.109
Can anybody hear me?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.593
This is Salvor Hardin calling
the Thespin lancers.

07:47.676 --> 07:52.097
The Invictus jumped and we've dragged
your ships into our quantum wake.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.184
We're in orbit around Terminus.

07:57.936 --> 08:02.441
If you can hear me, I have no idea
how to stop this ship from jumping again.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.528
It could be an hour from now.
It could be days.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.699
I figure I'm stuck here, unless…

08:35.097 --> 08:36.099
The Beggar.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.479
How do you get home?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.899
Take me through your route.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.446
Where does this corridor go?

08:50.072 --> 08:51.823
The underground irrigation system.

08:51.907 --> 08:56.078
But there's a path above it you could take
through the old palace ruins.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.956
You end up at the servants' exit,
right next to the palace gates.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.249
So, if I could exit here…

09:00.332 --> 09:02.584
Hyperloop station's just there.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.920
Gate security has DNA scanners.

09:06.296 --> 09:10.884
I'll need the signal damper.
For my nanobots. So they can't track me.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.386
I think I can get you one.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.807
I don't wanna die in this place.

09:18.809 --> 09:19.935
You won't.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.064
I can't promise it'll all go right.

09:24.857 --> 09:27.317
All I can promise is
I won't be the part that goes wrong.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.154
I have to go. Brother Dusk is--

09:31.238 --> 09:32.281
Cleon--

09:33.282 --> 09:36.577
I wish you had another name.
One that was just yours.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.372
Tomorrow you can give me one.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.718
Get me that signal damper,
and I'll see you on the other side.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.728
My apologies, Brother Dusk. I was--

10:02.811 --> 10:06.565
I understand.
Time flows differently when you're young.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.944
I want to share something with you.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.492
This is my workplace, as you know.

10:18.827 --> 10:24.541
The signature task of Dusk
is to record our visual history.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.504
The end of the Robot Wars.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.799
The Golden Horse Rebellion.

10:32.883 --> 10:37.346
Each moment an inflection point
for our dynasty,

10:37.429 --> 10:41.558
when the fate of the galaxy
seemed to be hanging in the balance.

10:45.521 --> 10:46.980
As it did here…

10:52.778 --> 10:57.616
when I chastened the barbarian worlds
for their acts of savagery.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.284
And even while I was painting it,

10:59.368 --> 11:05.624
I was conscious of how we, as its authors,
would be represented.

11:07.918 --> 11:12.339
A clever artist provides commentary
with his work.

11:13.966 --> 11:19.721
Even something as simple
as a choice of color

11:21.181 --> 11:23.058
can convey a hidden meaning.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.771
And sometimes the moment's not so obvious.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.649
Sometimes it slips past us,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.527
and you don't even realize it
until it is past,

11:34.027 --> 11:38.323
until your debut on the wall is upon you.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.579
I've painted you into our legacy.

11:53.839 --> 11:54.923
Our hunt.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.636
Do you see
the three ghillie raptors you shot?

12:03.432 --> 12:04.683
Of course.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.687
I've dreamed of one day doing something,

12:09.271 --> 12:11.899
anything, worthy enough
to be included in this mural.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.861
I don't know why this small feat is…

12:19.406 --> 12:22.409
I'm honored. Thank you.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.166
I knew you had
the greatness of Cleon I in you.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.171
But during our hunt,

12:35.714 --> 12:41.386
I realized there was something else
inside you as well.

12:43.347 --> 12:47.309
I'll leave you to reflect
on your own glorious moment.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.520
Take your time.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.273
Appreciate the subtleties.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.651
What we choose
to tell our children and what we censor.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.073
What we illuminate and what we gloss over.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.414
History as an act
of addition and subtraction.

14:27.451 --> 14:31.830
Empire, you're needed
in the Principium Tower.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.083
I can't. I'm busy.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.085
Brother Dusk insists.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.296
I'm indisposed.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.341
I need a minute alone,
and I'll come along. One minute.

14:43.509 --> 14:44.843
I am also Empire, you know.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.512
Yes, Empire.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.972
But we both serve.

15:03.237 --> 15:06.114
I forgot something. I need to go back.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.076
It can wait.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.797
Lock down the entrance.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.888
Don't let anyone in or out.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.349
There's a path you can take
through the palace ruins.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.899
You end up at the servants' exit,
right next to the palace gates.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.030
This route takes you
to the underground irrigation system.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.283
Hyperloop station's just there.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.826
Spread out.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.986
Warning. Water cycling imminent.

17:08.904 --> 17:11.323
Warning. Water cycling imminent.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.030
Four moons, that's a long jump.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.578
Go.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.081
Beggar, wake the hell up.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.876
Welcome aboard, Captain Hardin.

19:57.656 --> 19:58.657
Excuse me?

20:09.293 --> 20:13.297
It's an imperial aura. For your jacket?

20:31.190 --> 20:35.360
Can you tell me how to get
to the Desnian Sector on level 33?

20:35.444 --> 20:41.200
Take the Cobalt Line down,
then transfer to Ery Loop.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.120
You wanna head inner core.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.634
Beggar, open a channel
to Terminus Control.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.427
Communications channel open.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.638
Terminus Control,
this is Salvor Hardin. Come in.

21:05.557 --> 21:06.558
Damn it.

21:07.935 --> 21:10.145
Beggar, scan all frequencies.
Find me anyone on comms.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.230
Scanning.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.859
No active comms detected

21:15.943 --> 21:17.486
on the surface of Terminus.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.036
You found someone?

21:26.119 --> 21:29.498
Caution. Anomalous debris
on potential intercept trajectory.

21:29.581 --> 21:30.874
Threat level low.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.379
What the hell is that?

21:35.462 --> 21:38.715
Alert. Anomalous debris
on confirmed intercept trajectory.

21:38.799 --> 21:39.800
Threat level moderate.

21:40.384 --> 21:41.844
I need guns. Where are the guns?

21:43.846 --> 21:44.888
Beggar, show me the guns.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.643
Warning. Anomalous debris
object impact imminent.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.020
Threat level severe. Warning.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.105
Target locked.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.191
Babe? Babe, are you there?

21:57.150 --> 21:58.652
Hugo, is that you?

22:13.792 --> 22:15.085
Our plan worked, Sal.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.882
How'd you get here from the Belt?

22:20.716 --> 22:22.009
Luck, mostly.

22:22.092 --> 22:26.096
I made contact with Thespin Command.
I rode shotgun on one of the lancers.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.184
And then I could see
the Invictus was about to jump,

22:30.267 --> 22:34.521
so I grabbed a sedation stick
and knocked myself out for the jump.

22:34.605 --> 22:36.899
Warned the rest of my people
to do the same.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.613
And I woke up to the dulcet tones
of your voice.

22:45.949 --> 22:48.285
But I don't understand
how you woke up so quickly.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.954
I never went to sleep.
It's like the Vault.

22:51.038 --> 22:53.999
I can't explain how or why,
but the jump just didn't affect me.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.834
So you got us back to Terminus?

22:55.918 --> 22:59.129
No, that was Lewis.
He died to get us back.

22:59.213 --> 23:01.048
And the Foundation's not responding?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.092
No one is,

23:05.677 --> 23:07.763
not even the Anacreons Phara left behind.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.559
It's the null field.

23:12.643 --> 23:14.394
I can feel it, Hugo.

23:16.271 --> 23:21.360
It's… even bigger. It's… louder.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.695
It's like it's enveloped the whole planet.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.533
I have to stop it.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.159
Are you crazy?

23:30.994 --> 23:32.746
What if they're all dead down there?

23:33.997 --> 23:36.166
What if we just left? Right now.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.210
We'll make a run for the Red Corridor.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.128
I'll show you Irina Four,
I'll show you Hesperus--

23:40.212 --> 23:41.547
I can't, Hugo.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.882
What if there is no solution
to this crisis?

23:45.217 --> 23:46.552
What if Seldon got it wrong?

23:58.397 --> 24:01.233
I have to see this through, Hugo.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.530
I have to fix this.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.330
What do you want me to do?

24:18.834 --> 24:23.130
The Invictus is gonna jump again
unless your people can disable its drives.

24:23.213 --> 24:25.674
Then let it jump. Let it take Phara.
It'll be out of our lives forever.

24:25.757 --> 24:26.758
No.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.136
The Foundation needs that ship.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.015
It's the way we end the crisis.

24:34.683 --> 24:37.060
-I can't tell you how…
-I just have a feeling.

24:43.609 --> 24:47.279
You said you have absolute faith in me.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.533
You still believe that?

24:55.954 --> 24:58.874
Be kind of a dick
if I changed my mind now, wouldn't I?

25:12.971 --> 25:14.181
I'll see you on the other side.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.401
I love you.

25:27.444 --> 25:28.570
Me too.

25:51.510 --> 25:54.638
You've lived every moment
of your life with people watching you.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.808
The Scar's different.

25:58.475 --> 26:00.018
You can lose yourself in it.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.273
For Empire, the Scar represents a failure.

26:04.857 --> 26:07.943
For the rest of Trantor,
it represents an opportunity.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.821
For the first time in centuries,

26:10.904 --> 26:15.158
we can look up and see
real clouds, real stars,

26:16.326 --> 26:19.663
not a simulation run by servers
designed to keep us complacent.

26:32.176 --> 26:36.221
I live on level 33,
in the Desnian Sector.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.102
Old Tertia makes the best
spiced malkas on the planet.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.152
This is the corridor I take home.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.782
It's nothing like your palace.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.119
It's chaotic. It's crowded.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.462
But it's alive.

27:12.174 --> 27:13.467
And it's waiting for you.

27:35.364 --> 27:36.365
I couldn't wait.

28:01.932 --> 28:03.433
You're not wearing your aura.

28:05.185 --> 28:09.815
I traded it for this,
so I wouldn't be recognized.

28:12.234 --> 28:13.527
The jacket's smart.

28:15.404 --> 28:16.446
Now we can burn it.

28:30.002 --> 28:34.214
We need to get my nanobots removed
in case they're tracking me. I…

28:35.424 --> 28:37.676
I probably shouldn't even stay here.

28:38.594 --> 28:40.846
It's okay. I got the signal damper.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.682
That'll cover you until we can arrange to…

28:48.312 --> 28:49.313
Hey.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.150
The hardest part's over.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.532
You got away from them.

29:02.910 --> 29:03.911
You're here.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.753
But, truthfully…

29:14.004 --> 29:15.506
you still smell terrible.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.053
Why don't you shower?

29:50.082 --> 29:52.709
Hey, I was thinking
about a new name for me.

29:59.258 --> 30:00.259
Azura?

30:11.937 --> 30:12.980
What is that for?

31:19.004 --> 31:20.672
According to Salvor,
the engine room is that way.

31:24.551 --> 31:28.180
We've got about thirty-three hours
to disable the jumpdrives.

31:29.681 --> 31:32.768
What happened here?

31:34.186 --> 31:38.190
A long and terrible story
that no one's alive to tell…

31:38.649 --> 31:39.858
Anacreons, where?

31:40.651 --> 31:44.530
The bridge.
Salvor has them tied up in there.

31:45.572 --> 31:46.573
All clear.

32:01.171 --> 32:03.006
A wise man once said,

32:03.090 --> 32:06.134
"A people without history
is like a tree without roots."

32:10.055 --> 32:12.641
What's missing
from the wise man's history?

32:12.724 --> 32:14.560
When did story replace record?

32:19.231 --> 32:22.192
When all the facts
fall short of believability,

32:22.860 --> 32:25.654
fantasy feels reassuringly solid.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.074
And since this is my history,

32:29.700 --> 32:32.327
I get to decide
which parts have been subtracted,

32:33.662 --> 32:34.997
which have been added.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.125
Jord?

35:09.902 --> 35:12.571
Mom? Mom?

35:14.406 --> 35:17.242
Mom. Mom, wake up, it's me.

35:19.578 --> 35:21.622
Mom. Mom, wake up, it's me.

35:39.806 --> 35:41.016
Can you make anything of it?

36:09.044 --> 36:11.797
Fine. I'll figure it out myself.

36:35.821 --> 36:37.656
Open your fists, Salvor.

36:39.950 --> 36:41.326
Open your fists, Salvor.

36:41.994 --> 36:42.995
Come on.

37:00.721 --> 37:01.972
Can you make anything of it?

37:02.556 --> 37:05.184
Salvor, if you were part of the Plan,

37:05.267 --> 37:07.853
it would make it a lot easier
for me to believe in all this.

37:23.035 --> 37:24.953
How long did it take you…

37:25.871 --> 37:27.456
to trigger the Prime Radiant?

37:27.998 --> 37:29.249
Got it on the second try.

37:45.516 --> 37:50.103
History is the ultimate weapon,
because it harnesses time itself.

37:50.896 --> 37:54.858
Used correctly,
the past can alter the present.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.903
What other invention can do that?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.292
Salvor?

38:53.375 --> 38:54.376
Mom?

39:01.925 --> 39:03.969
-I thought I'd never see you again.
-Me too.

39:14.396 --> 39:17.399
The null field, it's stopped.

39:27.117 --> 39:28.202
Did you do this?

39:37.961 --> 39:39.129
Is that a door?

39:43.133 --> 39:44.593
I think so.

39:44.676 --> 39:46.094
So, what now?

39:48.639 --> 39:50.057
Now is where it ends.

40:00.859 --> 40:02.528
Did you find the Huntress?

40:02.945 --> 40:04.279
We searched the entire ship.

40:04.655 --> 40:05.864
No sign of her.

40:06.907 --> 40:08.742
Except this.

40:10.244 --> 40:12.663
Then we get down to Terminus
as fast as possible.

40:13.747 --> 40:16.583
Obsidian, open a channel
to Arkose and Gneiss.

40:16.667 --> 40:19.127
Communications channel open.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.672
This is Thespin Command.

40:22.548 --> 40:26.426
I want all lancers planet-side
immediately.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.972
Which one of you is this ship slave to?

40:36.186 --> 40:40.065
Slave this ship to Phara Keaen,
or you die too.

40:40.148 --> 40:44.903
Arkose, invoke protocol.
Ship transfer, Phara Keaen.

40:57.207 --> 40:58.709
Heart rate's rising.

41:02.254 --> 41:05.799
If it gets to 120,
then the bots go into crisis mode.

41:07.467 --> 41:09.136
I'll increase the inhibitors.

41:10.220 --> 41:11.305
Pulse is stabilizing.

41:16.268 --> 41:17.978
Start the transfer now.

41:55.098 --> 41:57.518
We're transferring your nanobots
into my blood.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.521
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

42:01.688 --> 42:03.190
To have them removed?

42:03.273 --> 42:04.399
Who are you?

42:04.483 --> 42:07.528
A Dawn clone, obviously.

42:07.611 --> 42:09.613
Superficially identical to you.

42:11.532 --> 42:13.325
But how are you…

42:13.408 --> 42:16.954
Here? Instead of floating in an aquarium?

42:19.081 --> 42:22.501
Our people managed to smuggle
some of Cleon I's DNA out of the palace.

42:23.418 --> 42:25.337
We've been working
towards this day for decades.

42:25.420 --> 42:28.966
You surprised us.
We'd planned to have you escape tomorrow.

42:30.050 --> 42:31.343
Where's Azura?

42:43.230 --> 42:44.565
This was all a trap.

42:46.441 --> 42:47.985
How could you do this to me?

42:49.194 --> 42:50.195
You?

42:51.321 --> 42:52.948
This is about the rest of the galaxy,

42:53.532 --> 42:56.660
all the planets and people who've
been crushed under the Empire's heel.

42:56.743 --> 42:57.870
It's not his fault.

42:59.329 --> 43:00.706
It's how he was raised.

43:02.291 --> 43:04.543
He and his brothers have always been told

43:04.626 --> 43:08.463
they are the light that never dims,
an unbroken chain.

43:10.674 --> 43:13.719
Reality just doesn't penetrate
their little terrarium.

43:14.595 --> 43:16.763
I don't know how you're gonna stomach it.

43:16.847 --> 43:17.848
I'll be fine.

43:18.849 --> 43:20.851
I've been practicing my role long enough,

43:21.935 --> 43:24.605
the cloistered little tyrant
in the making…

43:27.649 --> 43:32.821
projecting that subtle air
of self-pitying, arrogant indifference.

43:35.824 --> 43:39.828
Practicing? What are you talking about?

43:40.370 --> 43:43.290
"Practicing? What are you talking about?"

43:44.958 --> 43:46.793
I'm your understudy, Dawn.

43:46.877 --> 43:49.379
And now it's time
for me to take center stage.

43:49.963 --> 43:51.924
I'm going to go back to the palace,

43:53.258 --> 43:54.760
and I'm gonna be you.

43:56.386 --> 43:59.181
They'll just kill you then.
They know I'm different.

43:59.264 --> 44:01.099
Right, but…

44:02.518 --> 44:03.644
I'm not.

44:04.394 --> 44:08.023
I'm not color-blind. I'm not left-handed.

44:08.774 --> 44:11.902
I'm genetically identical to Cleon I.

44:14.071 --> 44:15.072
And I can prove it.

44:15.155 --> 44:17.407
I don't understand.

44:18.534 --> 44:20.869
How can you be identical to the first,
and I'm not?

44:21.620 --> 44:24.998
"Magnetic nanoparticle transfection"
is the technical term.

44:25.582 --> 44:27.417
It's all a little over my head,

44:27.501 --> 44:30.170
but, basically, they altered your DNA
after the fact.

44:30.254 --> 44:34.341
Like I said, this has been planned since
before you or I took our first breath.

44:34.842 --> 44:37.469
Our people knew they had to get you
out of the palace,

44:38.637 --> 44:40.222
but they couldn't just take you.

44:40.931 --> 44:42.432
That would've been too risky.

44:43.058 --> 44:45.936
They had to make it
so you'd choose to leave.

44:47.229 --> 44:51.358
You needed a motive to run.
And what better motive than survival?

44:54.194 --> 44:58.031
We're the ones
who made you different, Empire.

45:00.158 --> 45:02.244
In a certain way, you're lucky too.

45:02.327 --> 45:05.581
The Genetic Dynasty's
an affront to humanity,

45:05.664 --> 45:06.832
and you're no longer part of it.

45:08.750 --> 45:09.877
You never really were.

45:11.670 --> 45:13.422
The transfer's complete.

45:40.616 --> 45:42.451
You had no choice in any of this…

45:44.161 --> 45:45.829
but thank you just the same.

45:56.798 --> 45:58.258
Get him up.

46:01.887 --> 46:03.555
What are you gonna do to me?

46:03.639 --> 46:04.765
What do you think, Cleon?

46:30.290 --> 46:31.792
Azura. Azura, this way.

46:52.062 --> 46:53.063
Empire.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.860
Brother Dusk! I am so grateful.

47:01.738 --> 47:04.116
I want a full memory audit
of all the dead.

47:04.199 --> 47:05.242
And the girl?

47:06.451 --> 47:08.912
The girl. Yes.

47:13.250 --> 47:15.085
Quite a performance.

47:16.003 --> 47:18.755
It was a pleasure to observe it,

47:20.048 --> 47:23.760
tailored though it was
to the young and foolish.

47:33.687 --> 47:35.898
You didn't really think
we'd let this drone leave the palace

47:35.981 --> 47:37.900
without alerting us, did you?

47:37.983 --> 47:42.946
We followed your whole
enticing travelogue home, my dear.

47:51.163 --> 47:53.290
You let him get away
so he would lead you to us.

47:54.124 --> 47:55.125
Shroud her.

48:16.188 --> 48:17.731
You got what you wanted then.

48:19.024 --> 48:21.693
Never presume to understand what I want.

48:27.407 --> 48:31.245
You are stupid, naive, gullible.

48:31.995 --> 48:33.288
So was I at your age.

48:33.914 --> 48:35.582
And these things are forgivable.

48:35.666 --> 48:39.586
But the matter of your… difference,

48:41.129 --> 48:42.589
that's rather more complicated.

48:42.673 --> 48:44.633
But you must've heard them.

48:45.676 --> 48:48.345
I'm a victim. We all are.

48:48.428 --> 48:49.805
Yes.

48:49.888 --> 48:54.268
And that makes you
the embodiment of our vulnerability,

48:54.351 --> 48:56.979
an ugly reminder of the knife-edge

48:57.062 --> 49:00.607
upon which
our Genetic Dynasty is balanced.

49:01.358 --> 49:06.738
By what logic would we want
to look on your face ever again?

49:08.198 --> 49:09.241
My face?

49:12.077 --> 49:13.620
My face is your face.

49:14.663 --> 49:18.625
Forget logic. Try empathy.

49:27.467 --> 49:29.261
Wait, wait, wait.

49:29.344 --> 49:32.514
Surely it's not up to you. It's up to Day.

49:33.849 --> 49:34.850
True.

49:35.475 --> 49:37.102
Brother Day will be home soon.

49:37.895 --> 49:39.438
You can plead your case to him.

49:40.689 --> 49:44.860
I doubt his experience on the Maiden
has made him serene.

49:55.037 --> 49:57.456
Warden, you made it back!

49:57.539 --> 49:59.124
Keep your distance, you two.

49:59.208 --> 50:01.376
But everyone's waking up. It's over.

50:01.460 --> 50:02.961
It's not over.

50:03.045 --> 50:04.546
Salvor, wait. Don't go in there.

50:04.630 --> 50:06.215
I have to, Mom.

50:07.758 --> 50:09.551
You will not! Step away.

50:10.177 --> 50:13.388
You said this wasn't a trick,
that you didn't know what this was.

50:13.472 --> 50:14.473
We don't.

50:14.556 --> 50:17.809
And yet your daughter has tamed it.
How do you explain that?

51:22.332 --> 51:24.459
Sorry, Sal.
I tried to talk 'em out of landing.

51:25.127 --> 51:26.962
No, this makes sense.

51:27.045 --> 51:31.466
This is where I'm supposed to be.
Everything converging in a single crisis.

51:31.550 --> 51:33.594
Where is our Huntress?

51:35.721 --> 51:37.639
She lost control of the Invictus.

51:38.390 --> 51:42.561
Your plans for martyrdom, for Trantor,
they're done.

51:43.228 --> 51:44.438
Rowan?

51:45.314 --> 51:47.649
The Weald Gods have forsaken us.

52:17.346 --> 52:18.972
Oh, hammered shit.

52:33.529 --> 52:37.366
Well, isn't this a pretty picture?

52:37.950 --> 52:42.079
Enemies old and new,
conveniently gathered in one place.

52:46.375 --> 52:49.294
Drop your weapons and unbind him.

52:57.094 --> 53:01.765
And you, Warden, don't even think
about flashing that coin of yours.

53:02.432 --> 53:05.853
I'm glad you're alive, Phara, truly.

53:07.771 --> 53:08.772
I need you to hear this.

53:08.856 --> 53:12.276
Last thing I'm interested in hearing
is more words from you.

53:12.359 --> 53:15.821
Phara, please. The jump induces psychosis.
You're not thinking straight.

53:15.904 --> 53:17.573
I'm thinking just fine.

53:25.205 --> 53:26.373
Also aiming.

53:26.456 --> 53:28.959
Look, if you don't like
what I have to say,

53:29.668 --> 53:33.422
you can kill me when I'm done.
You can kill all of us.

53:33.505 --> 53:35.007
I will.

53:37.009 --> 53:38.385
That ship…

53:40.262 --> 53:44.641
is the most powerful weapon
your people will ever get their hands on.

53:45.475 --> 53:47.895
If that's the case, why destroy it?

53:49.813 --> 53:52.399
-Why not use it for leverage?
-How?

53:52.482 --> 53:55.652
We band together, all three worlds.

53:55.736 --> 53:57.112
Stop moving!

54:00.032 --> 54:01.783
We can share the Invictus.

54:01.867 --> 54:05.662
We can repair it, together.

54:06.997 --> 54:11.043
All we have to do is let our logic speak
louder than our emotions.

54:16.673 --> 54:17.674
Phara, stop.

54:20.093 --> 54:24.890
You would take up arms
against your own Huntress?

54:24.973 --> 54:26.934
The hunt is over, Phara.

54:40.531 --> 54:42.074
Phara, stop!

55:13.939 --> 55:15.607
-Take aim!
-Freestone, wait!

55:19.820 --> 55:22.447
She's gone. Drop it.

55:43.468 --> 55:44.970
Well, this is encouraging.

55:45.554 --> 55:48.807
Anacreons, Thespins, and Termini.

55:50.017 --> 55:52.769
Seeing you all gathered here
gives me hope…

55:55.939 --> 55:58.025
we might actually pull this off.
