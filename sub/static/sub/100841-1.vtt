WEBVTT

01:43.413 --> 01:46.281
Take this slip, go to
room number three, please.

01:46.315 --> 01:49.385
Amina Mergessa
and Ahmed Mergessa.

01:59.796 --> 02:00.763
Welcome to the UK.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.668
Is there a Miss Abdal?

02:07.737 --> 02:08.538
Miss Abdal?

02:11.841 --> 02:13.041
You're Lilly Abdal?

02:13.776 --> 02:14.577
Follow me.

02:25.388 --> 02:26.422
This is your father?

02:27.356 --> 02:28.190
Yes.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.529
You've come from Ethiopia.

02:35.431 --> 02:36.566
Where were you before that?

02:37.700 --> 02:38.501
Morocco.

02:39.435 --> 02:40.570
How long were you there?

02:41.571 --> 02:42.371
12 years.

02:44.172 --> 02:45.173
Where were you born?

02:47.142 --> 02:49.846
My father told me I was born
on a Mongolian fishing boat

02:49.879 --> 02:51.179
off the coast of Botswana.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.549
But they're...

02:52.582 --> 02:53.449
Yes.

02:54.817 --> 02:56.184
Two landlocked countries.

02:57.119 --> 02:57.720
I know that now.

03:05.728 --> 03:08.398
And your mother, did she have

03:08.431 --> 03:10.867
a different version
of your birth?

03:10.900 --> 03:12.635
She said they found me
under a leaf.

03:14.571 --> 03:15.505
Right.

03:18.373 --> 03:19.676
Someone from Ethiopia...

03:21.444 --> 03:23.178
if they were to come to
England, how would I know?

03:23.211 --> 03:25.347
With the sheer
volume of refugees,

03:25.381 --> 03:27.249
and the fact that
not everyone ends up

03:27.282 --> 03:29.586
in the United Kingdom,
I'm afraid there's no way.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.854
Now, if you'll follow me.

03:33.790 --> 03:34.724
I need to go back.

03:39.294 --> 03:42.398
That's impossible,
the country's in chaos.

03:50.372 --> 03:51.708
Yes,
if you step this way please.

03:55.578 --> 03:56.913
Take a seat here.

04:00.817 --> 04:02.150
Just wait here.

04:09.892 --> 04:11.461

Well done, Lilly.

05:20.930 --> 05:22.665
<i>When I was
seven years old,</i>

05:22.699 --> 05:24.801
<i>my parents took me
to a Sufi shrine.</i>

05:26.368 --> 05:28.336
Why are we here?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.739
To see The Great Abdal.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.274
<i>They took me
there to be blessed</i>

05:32.307 --> 05:33.810
<i>by a revered Sufi master.</i>

05:37.013 --> 05:37.814
<i>The Great Abdal.</i>

05:51.694 --> 05:53.396
<i>At least that's
what they told me.</i>

06:04.339 --> 06:04.941
Mom!

06:09.045 --> 06:11.481
Mom! Mom.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.452
Where are you going?

06:16.486 --> 06:18.721
We're just, uh,
going for a ride.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.591
Why aren't you taking me?

06:24.460 --> 06:26.294
Why don't you go back and play
with the other children?

06:26.328 --> 06:27.362
No, but, Mom.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.332
Sorry, Lilly.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.402
We'll be back
before you know it.

06:36.773 --> 06:38.407
We'll see you soon, Lilly.

07:47.610 --> 07:49.545
It took some doing,

07:49.579 --> 07:52.849
but we were able to find
a record of a daughter

07:52.882 --> 07:56.686
born to a Philip
and Alice Mitchel named Lilly.

07:57.587 --> 07:59.455
Seems they applied for
a passport for you

07:59.488 --> 08:01.457
at the British
consulate in Istanbul.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.126
They never returned
to pick it up.

08:08.164 --> 08:11.901
This card identifies
you as a British citizen

08:11.934 --> 08:14.871
and permits you to return
home with all due rights

08:14.904 --> 08:18.140
and privileges, something
you will come to appreciate

08:18.174 --> 08:19.709
if you have any sense at all.

08:25.147 --> 08:26.816
But that's not my name.

08:26.849 --> 08:27.817
It is now.

08:55.144 --> 08:57.013
Attention, please!

08:57.046 --> 08:58.681
I have a short announcement!

08:59.749 --> 09:01.684
Is there someone who
can translate for me?

09:04.587 --> 09:05.955
Is the English girl here?

09:09.125 --> 09:09.926
I'll do it!

09:18.668 --> 09:21.570
Do you want me to translate into
Amharic, Harari or Oromigna?

09:21.604 --> 09:22.905
Whatever you think best.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.208
Very well, you may proceed.

09:26.242 --> 09:30.546
The Refugee Referral Agency
will arrange for long-term

09:30.579 --> 09:33.549
housing at several
different council estates

09:33.582 --> 09:35.685
as they become available.

09:35.718 --> 09:39.822
The name of anyone eligible
for immediate consideration

09:39.855 --> 09:43.859
will be posted on a bulletin
board in the dining area.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.696
But what happens to us
if we're not chosen?

09:46.729 --> 09:48.164
Until your name
appears on that list,

09:48.197 --> 09:49.966
you can assume that most of you

09:49.999 --> 09:51.667
will be here for
the foreseeable future.

10:05.581 --> 10:07.016
Now, if there are
no further questions.

10:07.049 --> 10:08.184
I have a question.

10:16.025 --> 10:17.660
When will she be back?

10:17.693 --> 10:19.195
She won't.

10:19.228 --> 10:20.629
When a person in authority says,

10:20.663 --> 10:22.064
"And if there are no
further questions,"

10:22.098 --> 10:23.532
it means they had no intention

10:23.566 --> 10:24.767
of answering them
in the first place.

10:26.769 --> 10:28.270
I didn't know that.

10:28.304 --> 10:29.605
Then you have a lot to learn.

10:56.665 --> 10:57.767
Nouria!

12:30.126 --> 12:31.595
What did we expect?

13:43.265 --> 13:44.266
Excuse me.

13:46.302 --> 13:49.338
I'm supposed to go to
the Pelham Garden Estate.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.474
Pelham is what we say.

13:51.508 --> 13:53.175
Pelham.

13:53.209 --> 13:54.444
That's it, right there.

13:54.477 --> 13:56.178
Straight ahead and turn left.

13:56.212 --> 13:57.012
You'll see it.

13:58.481 --> 13:59.949
And there's no garden.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.084
Thank you.

14:18.468 --> 14:19.436
All right.

16:00.336 --> 16:01.904
She's been circumcised.

16:26.596 --> 16:27.963
I told her...

16:27.996 --> 16:29.432
I know what you told her.

16:34.504 --> 16:35.605
You would make a good nurse.

16:49.051 --> 16:49.952
You are right.

17:05.402 --> 17:08.069
Now I must ask you
some questions.

17:13.576 --> 17:16.579
I don't really know anything.
You should really ask Nouria.

17:16.613 --> 17:18.946
My questions are not
about the child.

17:20.214 --> 17:21.049
Oh.

17:22.217 --> 17:23.553
Who are you?

17:24.721 --> 17:26.656
And what in the world
are you doing in Harar?

17:29.392 --> 17:31.193
Is this information
required by the hospital?

17:33.730 --> 17:35.565
By me.

17:35.598 --> 17:36.399
I'm curious.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.537
You may have noticed, you do
not look like anyone else here.

17:42.472 --> 17:43.272
Yes, I did.

18:15.204 --> 18:17.139
But there was supposed
to be a teacher here.

18:27.617 --> 18:28.984
I lived in Harar.

18:30.118 --> 18:32.087
A Muslim like you.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.122
I studied Qur'an with the
Great Abdal at the shrine

18:34.156 --> 18:35.391
to the blessed Bilal al Habeshi.

18:43.098 --> 18:44.801
Wait!

18:44.834 --> 18:46.101
- Wait!
- We're not interested!

18:46.134 --> 18:48.070
I know, I know,
a question please.

18:48.103 --> 18:49.137
Just one moment.

18:53.810 --> 18:55.143
Do you know this man?

18:56.479 --> 18:58.347
Here in London?
Or is he still in Harar?

18:58.381 --> 18:59.449
I'm not sure.

19:02.819 --> 19:03.620
Sorry.

19:04.654 --> 19:06.656
Who is this doctor to you?

19:06.689 --> 19:08.725
And when did that
become our business?

19:08.758 --> 19:10.359
Just look again, please.

19:15.097 --> 19:17.232
No, my dear,
we don't know this man.

19:56.839 --> 19:58.340
I've come to check
on the patient.

20:16.526 --> 20:17.794
Oh, Lilly.

20:29.505 --> 20:30.406
May I speak to you?

20:35.378 --> 20:38.715
I would like to speak
to you in English,

20:38.748 --> 20:40.850
but I feel your friends
would not approve.

20:43.386 --> 20:46.288
Why would they consider it wrong
to speak in more than one language?

20:46.321 --> 20:48.658
Because it would appear
as if you and I were alone.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.461
Surely my reaction to your words

20:51.494 --> 20:53.295
would tell them everything
they need to know.

20:54.329 --> 20:55.565
And what reaction is that?

20:58.401 --> 20:59.267
I don't have one.

21:01.638 --> 21:03.439
Or perhaps I haven't
decided yet.

21:06.776 --> 21:09.277
If you do decide,

21:09.311 --> 21:12.382
and would consider sharing
that information with me...

21:15.551 --> 21:18.655
you might meet me at
the hospital at noon

21:18.688 --> 21:20.355
three days from now.

21:20.390 --> 21:22.257
That is when Nouria will
run out of the bandages

21:22.290 --> 21:23.191
I'm about to give her.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.628
And then what?

21:25.662 --> 21:27.463
That would be up to you.

21:34.236 --> 21:35.638
I would like to go somewhere
where I can see water.

21:39.942 --> 21:41.711
You don't make things easy,
do you?

21:42.945 --> 21:44.414
I don't make them
any way at all.

21:50.318 --> 21:52.354
Get something green,
like the sea.

23:14.070 --> 23:16.072
You might be eligible for
a position as a cleaner,

23:16.105 --> 23:16.939
but that's all.

23:19.408 --> 23:20.977
For 12 years I was taught
Qur'an by the greatest

23:21.010 --> 23:23.311
Sufi master in Morocco.

23:23.345 --> 23:26.048
As well as mathematics, astronomy,
and classical Persian poetry.

23:26.082 --> 23:28.017
I'm sorry, but nothing
you've told me

23:28.050 --> 23:31.554
suggests you qualify for
the auxiliary nursing program.

23:31.587 --> 23:34.490
You're saying I'm not
capable of emptying a bedpan?

23:34.524 --> 23:37.693
I'm sure you are, but there are
people with actual experience

23:37.727 --> 23:38.728
just as eager to do so.

23:40.096 --> 23:41.798
If you'll follow me.

23:41.831 --> 23:44.366
I speak Arabic,
some Amharic and enough Harari

23:44.400 --> 23:46.502
and Oromigna to translate
the patients.

23:46.536 --> 23:48.571
Surely with the countless
refugees arriving every day,

23:48.604 --> 23:49.505
that would be helpful.

23:53.609 --> 23:56.078
Be here tomorrow at eight
to meet with the supervisor

23:56.112 --> 23:57.847
of the auxiliary
nursing program.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.049
Now, don't misunderstand,

24:00.082 --> 24:01.884
you'll primarily be
emptying those bedpans.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.886
Which we've already
established I can do.

24:10.092 --> 24:13.429
How come I always lose
when I play with you, huh?

24:13.462 --> 24:14.430
He cheats.

24:28.878 --> 24:30.980
I know you.

24:31.013 --> 24:33.049
Just keep going!

24:33.082 --> 24:35.084
A few more stairs
and we'll get you into bed!

24:36.018 --> 24:38.788
She's having a baby!
Don't just stand there, help me!

24:38.821 --> 24:40.690
- Where's my son?
- He's there.

24:40.723 --> 24:42.525
- Where's my son?
- He's there. He's there, he's right there.

24:42.558 --> 24:44.160
Hold my hand!

24:44.193 --> 24:46.495
- Breathe, breathe.
- Hold my hand!

24:46.529 --> 24:48.030
Come and sit up.

24:48.064 --> 24:50.066
Oh, God.

24:50.099 --> 24:51.901
Don't resist!

24:57.874 --> 24:58.875
Come, come.

25:00.710 --> 25:01.944
Come on.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.630
- Now!
- w start pushing, yes, that's it.

25:20.663 --> 25:23.132
- It's coming!
- Push now. A bit harder.

25:23.165 --> 25:24.166
Come on.

25:29.171 --> 25:30.473
Come on!

25:33.976 --> 25:36.145
Nearly there.

25:39.849 --> 25:40.783
Is he okay?

25:42.151 --> 25:44.153
He is a she.

25:46.522 --> 25:47.723
Hello.

25:52.261 --> 25:54.630
Ahmed, come and see your sister.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.567
My son.

26:06.509 --> 26:08.778
Is there someone
we should call for you?

26:08.811 --> 26:11.847
- Someone at home?
- I found her in the building one over,

26:11.881 --> 26:13.849
- she was looking for a woman called Daisy.
- Daisy?

26:15.718 --> 26:17.954
They said when I was
in the shelter there

26:17.987 --> 26:20.056
that she may be
able to take us in.

26:20.089 --> 26:21.791
Daisy Obasi.

26:21.824 --> 26:23.259
Ah, okay.

26:23.292 --> 26:26.629
The rich boyfriend in
Manchester, he finally proposed.

26:26.662 --> 26:29.532
She's gone, I'm afraid.

26:29.565 --> 26:30.833
Is there somewhere
else you can stay?

26:32.902 --> 26:34.136
She can stay with me.

27:09.705 --> 27:11.540
She'll need these, it gets
cold in here at night.

27:20.883 --> 27:23.185
It must be nice to have
this place all to yourself.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.088
I didn't ask for it.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.289
You didn't have to.

27:32.294 --> 27:33.796
I just need a few hours...

27:36.165 --> 27:37.767
get a little sleep.

27:39.235 --> 27:41.670
There's fruit in the kitchen and
biscuits in the cupboard by the sink.

27:41.704 --> 27:42.872
Oh, thank you, Lilly.

28:16.272 --> 28:18.808
Haile Selassie
claims he's modernizing,

28:18.841 --> 28:20.609
creating a cash-crop economy.

28:20.643 --> 28:22.178
Isn't that a good thing?

28:22.211 --> 28:23.979
The farmers don't grow food
for their families anymore,

28:24.013 --> 28:26.082
they grow it for
the rich landlords.

28:26.115 --> 28:29.285
And what do they do?
Sell it around the world

28:29.318 --> 28:31.153
while their own people starve,

28:32.054 --> 28:35.758
and as the emperor's dogs
eat off golden plates.

28:35.791 --> 28:36.826
I had no idea.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.069
As you requested.

28:53.142 --> 28:55.845
I imagine this isn't
what you expected.

28:57.046 --> 28:58.147
I didn't know what to expect.

29:32.948 --> 29:34.917
Right now,
in this nearly perfect moment...

29:38.254 --> 29:40.356
it is easy to imagine
that anything is possible.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.363
That I won't see injustice
and despair everywhere I turn.

29:49.399 --> 29:51.767
When a thief looks at a saint,
all he sees are pockets.

29:53.503 --> 29:54.870
So I'm a thief, am I?

29:56.372 --> 29:57.706
It's a Sufi saying.

29:59.742 --> 30:01.010
It means what
we perceive in the world

30:01.043 --> 30:02.044
tells us who we are.

30:03.480 --> 30:04.747
Tell me what do you perceive.

30:05.881 --> 30:06.449
In the world?

30:08.918 --> 30:10.252
That's too much to ask.

30:11.253 --> 30:12.721
Then tell me what you
see when you look at me.

30:28.270 --> 30:30.072
You want to know what
I see when I look at you?

30:42.952 --> 30:44.019
I shouldn't be here.

30:47.424 --> 30:48.425
Then we'll go.

32:12.941 --> 32:14.243
Uh-oh, discovered.

32:16.211 --> 32:18.147
N... No. I'm...

32:18.180 --> 32:19.516
I'm not doing what
you think I'm doing.

32:21.183 --> 32:23.952
I mean I am,
but for someone in need.

32:23.986 --> 32:25.388
No, I meant me.

32:25.422 --> 32:26.922
You've discovered
my hiding place.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.459
It's hard to read around doctors

32:29.492 --> 32:32.094
when they're talking about
what it is they talk about

32:32.127 --> 32:33.797
when they aren't
doing any doctoring.

32:36.965 --> 32:37.600
That was humor.

32:42.472 --> 32:44.106
Or an attempt at
something like it.

32:46.609 --> 32:47.510
Then I'm leaving now.

32:48.411 --> 32:49.345
Oh, before you go.

32:56.185 --> 32:57.152
Zinc oxide.

33:02.459 --> 33:03.626
Nappy cream.

33:53.443 --> 33:55.210
I'm Fatima, you may
go downstairs.

33:58.381 --> 34:00.483
Don't you worry, I've got
everything under control.

34:16.666 --> 34:18.668
You're in for it now.

34:18.701 --> 34:20.670
They won't let me
leave for 40 days.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.473
But of course,
I won't stay that long.

34:23.505 --> 34:25.274
No.

34:25.306 --> 34:26.308
That's how it must be done.

34:29.277 --> 34:30.713
It will be a good thing.

34:30.746 --> 34:31.648
For both of us.

34:33.616 --> 34:34.451
Really?

34:45.060 --> 34:48.330
You are full of surprises,
English girl.

35:47.857 --> 35:49.124
My Papa's dead.

35:57.266 --> 35:58.066
Mine too.

36:48.918 --> 36:51.588
It has to look
especially nice today.

36:53.255 --> 36:54.757
Make sure you fluff it.

36:54.791 --> 36:56.258
I'm fluffing, Mrs. Peele.

36:58.193 --> 37:00.329
There, you look lovely.

37:00.362 --> 37:03.231
She's right,
you do look lovely.

37:05.835 --> 37:08.103
My son is coming
to visit me today.

37:08.938 --> 37:11.441
Perhaps a touch of lipstick?

37:11.474 --> 37:14.109
- Why don't we let the doctor take a look at you first.
- Oh, of course.

37:14.811 --> 37:17.380
This won't take long,
I promise.

37:21.918 --> 37:23.386
No sign of infection.

37:24.353 --> 37:25.388
I'm very pleased.

37:26.589 --> 37:27.590
Miss...

37:28.825 --> 37:31.159
- Abdal.
- Right, right.

37:31.193 --> 37:33.563
Yes, I must make note,
given that we're old friends.

37:45.541 --> 37:49.277
So, tell me, who's been
attending to the surgical site?

37:49.311 --> 37:51.213
I have.

37:51.246 --> 37:53.683
For someone with no training
you're doing excellent work.

37:53.716 --> 37:56.486
Which I'm saying because
there's no sign of infection.

37:56.519 --> 37:58.855
The training comment
was not relevant at all.

38:00.590 --> 38:01.624
Yes.

38:02.625 --> 38:03.826
That was meant
to be a compliment.

38:07.397 --> 38:09.699
Though it likely didn't sound
like one, that's what it was.

38:09.732 --> 38:11.834
I was acknowledging your skill.

38:14.537 --> 38:16.639
Yes, of course.
Thank you, doctor.

38:16.673 --> 38:18.741
Please, don't,
just don't make it worse.

38:18.775 --> 38:19.642
Just...

38:21.711 --> 38:22.845
good.

38:22.879 --> 38:24.847
Excellent. Carry on.

38:43.933 --> 38:44.734
Aziz!

39:10.927 --> 39:11.894
I'm so glad you came.

39:13.529 --> 39:14.797
I didn't know if it
was the right building.

39:28.544 --> 39:30.680
This is what we do here.

39:31.914 --> 39:35.283
We watch exactly what
the emperor wants us to see.

39:35.317 --> 39:38.521
We complain, we criticize,

39:38.554 --> 39:40.990
we imagine resisting,
but we still watch.

39:47.430 --> 39:49.632
You see this pale color?

39:49.665 --> 39:51.834
These are the best leaves.

39:51.868 --> 39:52.702
The sweetest.

40:24.433 --> 40:26.502
The army
is with us, Munir.

40:26.536 --> 40:29.071
Soldiers are turning their guns
on their own corrupt officers.

40:29.105 --> 40:31.707
Because they are
planning to take power.

40:31.741 --> 40:33.843
Good, it can't be
worse than Haile Selassie.

40:33.876 --> 40:36.344
It can always be worse.

40:36.379 --> 40:37.613
They'll get rid of
Haile Selassie,

40:37.647 --> 40:38.948
but they'll never
let the power go.

40:38.981 --> 40:41.651
You don't know what's in
the minds of the soldiers.

40:41.684 --> 40:43.920
They want to feed their
family just like us.

40:43.953 --> 40:46.989
The same soldiers who are
setting fields on fire

40:47.023 --> 40:47.957
to keep the crops
from their enemies?

40:49.792 --> 40:52.327
Destroying food while
their own people starve?

41:00.469 --> 41:01.671
Sadia.

41:03.673 --> 41:06.075
You are right, Sadia.

41:06.108 --> 41:09.145
The soldiers mutiny in
Asmara and we sit and talk.

41:09.178 --> 41:12.582
The unions call for a general
strike and we sit and talk.

41:12.615 --> 41:17.520
The army arrests government
officials, civilians,

41:17.553 --> 41:18.454
and guess what we do?

41:23.426 --> 41:25.728
Lilly, please,
do you mind if we go?

41:25.761 --> 41:27.096
- Aziz...
- Aah.

41:31.467 --> 41:32.668
Where are we going?

41:53.089 --> 41:54.423
Mr. Djimon.

42:09.472 --> 42:10.406
I am so sorry.

42:12.675 --> 42:13.442
What's wrong?

42:14.977 --> 42:16.078
He won't say anything,
I promise.

42:20.116 --> 42:21.550
I should feel nothing but shame.

42:23.519 --> 42:25.454
And no doubt I will, but...

42:27.723 --> 42:28.925
in this moment, I'm happy.

42:40.202 --> 42:41.137
I should get back.

42:42.738 --> 42:43.940
Nouria will be worried.

43:13.169 --> 43:15.237
Today I thought I saw someone
I knew at the hospital.

43:19.208 --> 43:20.676
Chased him down the hall.

43:24.613 --> 43:25.781
It wasn't him.

43:37.059 --> 43:37.893
Hmm.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.730
There is a man.

43:41.864 --> 43:42.898
I knew it.

43:48.037 --> 43:49.705
Such eyes.

43:51.707 --> 43:53.542
I can see why you'd
want to chase him.

43:54.877 --> 43:55.811
It wasn't like that.

43:58.114 --> 43:59.081
It wasn't?

44:02.051 --> 44:03.152
Not just that.

44:09.158 --> 44:10.192
What?

44:24.673 --> 44:25.741
So many people.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.181
She looks like Nouria.

44:33.916 --> 44:34.884
Might she be here?

44:35.951 --> 44:37.053
I can't imagine it.

44:38.388 --> 44:39.722
She would have gone
to the shrine.

44:42.024 --> 44:43.259
And your doctor?

44:49.131 --> 44:51.267
Anyone he met from home
would have sent him here

44:51.300 --> 44:52.601
to put up a message.

44:58.974 --> 45:00.810
He said he'd do
whatever it took.

45:03.646 --> 45:04.914
No matter what.

45:05.981 --> 45:07.983
Then make it as easy
for him as you can.

45:19.396 --> 45:21.997
I see you've found
my favorite seat.

45:23.999 --> 45:26.035
I always come out here
early to get this bench.

45:27.169 --> 45:29.605
It's, uh... it's quiet.

45:31.974 --> 45:33.709
Even when it's not.
You know what I mean.

45:35.378 --> 45:36.178
How can I?

45:37.380 --> 45:38.681
It doesn't make any sense.

45:42.852 --> 45:44.653
I didn't know
it actually had to.

45:45.888 --> 45:47.723
Here, please. It's yours.

45:50.693 --> 45:52.027
We could have shared it,
you know.

45:52.061 --> 45:53.229
People do that all the time!

46:00.369 --> 46:02.271
I know, I know, I know.

46:02.304 --> 46:04.441
But I prayed all night
that Sitta would sleep

46:04.474 --> 46:06.008
so that makes up for it.

46:08.077 --> 46:09.412
That's not how it works.

46:10.746 --> 46:14.717
And when I wasn't praying,
I was thinking about food.

46:14.750 --> 46:15.951
Now which one should I have?

46:15.985 --> 46:16.819
Cabbage curry?

46:20.890 --> 46:22.324
Or carrot curry?

46:27.062 --> 46:28.898
They both taste
exactly the same.

46:30.032 --> 46:32.301
My father would say curry
requires an education.

46:33.302 --> 46:34.069
Interesting.

46:35.804 --> 46:36.672
Tell me more.

46:37.806 --> 46:38.807
There's not much to tell.

46:40.410 --> 46:42.011
My parents died
when I was seven.

46:43.746 --> 46:46.749
A child alone is...
is a terrible thing.

46:47.850 --> 46:48.918
I wasn't alone.

46:50.487 --> 46:53.289
The shrine to Bilal al
Habeshi in Morocco took me in.

46:54.424 --> 46:57.092
The Great Abdal became
my teacher and my father.

46:58.327 --> 47:00.162
And that's the whole story?

47:00.196 --> 47:01.864
Until my journey to Harar.

47:02.831 --> 47:05.768
Lilly,
you are hopeless.

47:06.802 --> 47:08.237
What do you mean?

47:08.270 --> 47:10.306
Nobody knows anything,
so they fill in

47:10.339 --> 47:12.174
the facts where they can.

47:14.043 --> 47:17.780
Vertise, she swears that your
father was a big game hunter,

47:17.813 --> 47:19.949
and your mother owned
a coffee plantation.

47:21.116 --> 47:22.351
Why would she say that?

47:22.385 --> 47:23.420
For fun.

47:24.387 --> 47:25.354
It's in a book.

47:26.855 --> 47:28.090
The thing I don't
understand is why anyone

47:28.123 --> 47:29.158
cares about these things.

47:30.926 --> 47:33.829
Because that's what people
do when we come together.

47:35.364 --> 47:36.932
We tell each other our stories.

47:38.468 --> 47:41.136
And if you can't share your
story, then who are you?

47:43.440 --> 47:47.276
I spoke to Mrs. Jahangir
yesterday at the market.

47:47.309 --> 47:49.812
She said I can work there
three days a week to start.

47:50.946 --> 47:51.914
It's not much, but...

47:53.249 --> 47:54.917
if I get another job...

47:54.950 --> 47:56.819
You should teach.

47:56.852 --> 47:58.988
Of course I should
teach.

47:59.021 --> 48:02.191
Now, if only my degree,
my references,

48:02.224 --> 48:05.428
my experience would be
able to convince someone

48:05.462 --> 48:07.930
other than you that
I am qualified.

48:09.865 --> 48:13.403
But that's not the point,
my point is,

48:13.436 --> 48:15.904
if I get another job then
we can get our own place.

48:17.940 --> 48:18.941
Is that what you want?

48:21.277 --> 48:22.412
No.

48:23.513 --> 48:25.014
But surely you need me to go?

48:30.219 --> 48:31.320
Ahmed, be careful!

48:34.857 --> 48:35.891
What about your story?

48:38.027 --> 48:38.927
With their father?

48:43.566 --> 48:45.801
We knew what was
happening in the country.

48:48.337 --> 48:50.205
But for us everything was...

48:51.574 --> 48:53.576
it was good.

48:53.610 --> 48:56.912
Yusuf started going to
these political meetings,

48:56.945 --> 48:58.548
then he took part in strikes

48:58.581 --> 49:00.249
and protests against
the emperor.

49:02.284 --> 49:06.255
And I, I said,
"Silly man, what...

49:08.123 --> 49:09.592
What are you playing at?

49:10.926 --> 49:12.995
You're an agronomist.

49:13.028 --> 49:14.431
What do you know
of such things?"

49:17.032 --> 49:18.435
When Haile Selassie's
soldiers...

49:20.503 --> 49:24.940
beat him... until he was broken

49:24.973 --> 49:29.878
and bleeding and lying at the
feet of his wife and his son...

49:32.281 --> 49:33.616
he was so surprised.

49:38.187 --> 49:40.055
Don't do it!

49:42.191 --> 49:43.192
Those are new shoes!

49:45.260 --> 49:46.261
Ahmed!

49:48.263 --> 49:49.264
Ahmed!

50:53.362 --> 50:54.497
There is no meeting today.

50:56.064 --> 50:56.699
Where is Aziz?

51:16.686 --> 51:17.720
What are you doing here?

51:21.691 --> 51:24.427
I, I wanted to be with you.
I thought there would be a meeting.

51:24.461 --> 51:26.328
Djimon has heard
the house is being watched.

51:27.630 --> 51:28.997
We cannot meet here again.

51:29.699 --> 51:31.401
Then when will I be
able to see you?

51:35.805 --> 51:38.106
Come away with me. One night.

51:38.140 --> 51:39.341
No, I can't.

51:41.176 --> 51:42.344
What would I tell Nouria?

51:43.513 --> 51:47.182
Uh, tell her you are shopping

51:48.585 --> 51:50.820
- for Sadia's wedding.
- It's another lie.

51:54.691 --> 51:56.258
Everything is changing, Lilly.

51:58.495 --> 51:59.429
Everything.

52:01.296 --> 52:03.098
What does that have to do
with the nature of my sins?

52:08.671 --> 52:09.572
Just say yes.

52:22.519 --> 52:23.486
Say yes.

52:26.623 --> 52:27.423
Yes.

52:41.270 --> 52:42.204
Be careful.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.442
Promise me.

53:07.362 --> 53:10.299
My goal is to bring
Lilly into the 20th century

53:10.332 --> 53:12.334
whether she likes it or not!

53:14.369 --> 53:16.171
That was my sofa.

53:16.204 --> 53:18.541
Ah, well, this is your sofa now.

53:18.575 --> 53:20.710
I bought it from Vertise.
She got a new one

53:20.743 --> 53:23.145
with blue and pink flowers
on a cream background.

53:23.178 --> 53:25.715
Which looks terrible with her
green carpet, if you ask me.

53:25.748 --> 53:27.650
Deh? Nobody is.

53:27.684 --> 53:29.217
So what do you think?

53:29.251 --> 53:30.620
It's very plaid.

53:31.921 --> 53:33.756
Excellent observation.

53:33.790 --> 53:36.492
But it also does
something very special.

53:36.526 --> 53:39.361
Ahmed, come and show
Auntie her surprise.

53:49.472 --> 53:51.507
This is wonderful!

53:51.541 --> 53:54.544
- I've never seen anything like it!
- You see what I mean?

53:54.577 --> 53:57.312
Every day with Lilly I get
to experience the world anew.

54:41.991 --> 54:43.258
Amina?

54:49.264 --> 54:50.298
Are you all right?

55:05.648 --> 55:08.384
- We should go to hospital.
- No.

55:08.418 --> 55:09.585
Amina,
it could be something serious.

55:10.620 --> 55:11.587
I know what it is.

55:19.929 --> 55:21.196
In the refugee camp...

55:26.636 --> 55:29.605
I had to do whatever
I could to protect Ahmed.

55:29.639 --> 55:30.940
Of course.

55:31.874 --> 55:35.545
The guards... when they
saw I wasn't circumcised...

55:37.547 --> 55:38.514
they turned me over...

55:40.282 --> 55:41.417
and did it the other way.

55:44.687 --> 55:46.422
Sometimes there is pain.

55:49.291 --> 55:50.693
Sometimes there's blood.

55:56.699 --> 55:57.633
It's over now.

56:01.704 --> 56:02.939
It will never be over.

56:16.519 --> 56:17.687
The water's cold.

56:24.961 --> 56:25.995
I'll check on Sitta.

56:59.796 --> 57:01.296
How long were you in the camp?

57:05.835 --> 57:06.702
Eight months.

57:15.077 --> 57:16.311
You figured it out.

57:18.614 --> 57:19.715
You could have told me.

57:28.558 --> 57:29.492
Which part?

57:32.695 --> 57:35.498
The shame that my Yusuf
isn't her father?

57:38.568 --> 57:39.735
Or the relief...

57:41.737 --> 57:42.905
that he didn't have to live

57:42.939 --> 57:44.807
knowing what they
did to his wife?

58:03.593 --> 58:04.694
<i>allahu akbar.</i>

58:30.887 --> 58:34.156
You must make a truly
light meringue, Mrs. Peele.

58:34.190 --> 58:37.627
I have never been able to make a
floating island actually float.

58:40.029 --> 58:40.997
Let me see.

58:53.809 --> 58:56.178
- Good afternoon, Mr. Jahangir.
- Afternoon.

58:56.212 --> 58:58.214
Come and see what
I'm doing in the storeroom.

58:58.247 --> 59:00.716
Oh, yes, she has big plans.

59:00.750 --> 59:02.818
Wants to do everything
but sell my groceries.

59:09.158 --> 59:11.594
So, what do you think?

59:13.562 --> 59:14.196
About what?

59:15.097 --> 59:16.465
Our new office.

59:17.500 --> 59:19.535
Why do we need an office?

59:19.568 --> 59:23.973
For the Ethiopian Family
Reunification Association.

59:24.006 --> 59:26.642
- But there's no such thing.
- Well, there is now.

59:28.144 --> 59:30.813
See, after Djibouti,
I had to go through

59:30.846 --> 59:33.516
the central refugee
office in Rome.

59:33.549 --> 59:35.751
There were thousands
of us just waiting...

59:35.785 --> 59:38.888
I know, I was there for
I don't know how many weeks.

59:38.921 --> 59:43.592
We were there for months. And we just waited
while they did their endless paperwork.

59:43.626 --> 59:46.128
Now, if the office in
Rome could send a list

59:46.162 --> 59:47.863
of new arrivals from Ethiopia,

59:47.897 --> 59:49.932
it could be matched with
a list of people here

59:49.966 --> 59:51.834
searching for their relatives.

59:51.867 --> 59:53.569
Where would that list come from?

59:53.602 --> 59:55.838
How many
Ethiopian refugees

59:55.871 --> 59:58.541
are in our community
center alone?

59:58.574 --> 01:00:02.278
And almost every one of
them is just like you.

01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:03.913
Like me?

01:00:03.946 --> 01:00:06.148
They want to know if the
loved ones they left behind

01:00:06.182 --> 01:00:07.783
got out of the country alive.

01:00:09.285 --> 01:00:12.188
Look, my husband is gone.

01:00:12.221 --> 01:00:14.156
You don't know that for sure.

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:15.791
You only saw them take him away.

01:00:15.825 --> 01:00:16.826
He's gone.

01:00:19.028 --> 01:00:22.631
We will do this together,
but for our own reasons.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.769
Now, I believe your
exact words were.

01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:37.179
See?

01:00:37.213 --> 01:00:39.181
You really have no choice.

01:00:40.816 --> 01:00:43.085
Amina! Customer!

01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:09.045
Do you believe Miss Nairobi
won wearing that dress?

01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:16.085
Lilly, are you going to do
that until we get to Dire Dawa?

01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:17.286
Sadia, we lied!

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.889
We're not going to shop
for your wedding.

01:01:19.922 --> 01:01:21.557
So what? We harm no one.

01:01:22.892 --> 01:01:24.894
But what if you and I...

01:01:24.927 --> 01:01:27.096
- If we both...
- Have sex?

01:01:29.298 --> 01:01:30.599
Me and Munir have done it.

01:01:31.901 --> 01:01:33.235
Twice.

01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:34.804
Aren't you worried?

01:01:34.837 --> 01:01:36.238
About my parents finding out?

01:01:36.272 --> 01:01:37.339
About your soul.

01:01:37.373 --> 01:01:38.674
Ah, Lilly.

01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:40.743
You're so naive.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:55.191
I see Munir.

01:02:32.895 --> 01:02:33.796
Thank you.

01:02:41.237 --> 01:02:42.371
You're a very practical Muslim.

01:02:44.206 --> 01:02:47.243
I like to decide
things for myself.

01:02:47.276 --> 01:02:51.947
Surely you have considered the Qur'an
is not meant to be... taken literally.

01:02:51.981 --> 01:02:57.987
That it is a... a story to be
interpreted by each, in his own way.

01:03:02.858 --> 01:03:03.426
I am sorry.

01:03:04.994 --> 01:03:05.761
I am sorry.

01:03:07.397 --> 01:03:09.131
It has been pointed out
to me more than once

01:03:09.165 --> 01:03:10.400
that I tend to state
the obvious.

01:03:11.901 --> 01:03:13.135
Clarity is not a sin.

01:03:14.471 --> 01:03:15.704
But boring people is.

01:03:17.407 --> 01:03:19.409
I've actually tasted
liquor before.

01:03:19.442 --> 01:03:20.410
Truly?

01:03:21.478 --> 01:03:23.279
When was this?

01:03:23.312 --> 01:03:26.115
When I was five-years-old,
maybe six.

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:28.684
You are teasing me.

01:03:29.752 --> 01:03:30.387
I'm not.

01:03:32.121 --> 01:03:34.056
My parents had very
unusual ideas.

01:03:35.224 --> 01:03:36.158
They were not Muslim?

01:03:36.192 --> 01:03:38.928
No. No.

01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:40.329
I have wondered
why you never spoke

01:03:40.362 --> 01:03:41.398
of your father and mother.

01:03:43.132 --> 01:03:44.867
The Great Abdal
taught me to look forward.

01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:47.102
And so here you are.

01:03:48.103 --> 01:03:49.838
With a Muslim who
believes his faith is

01:03:50.906 --> 01:03:52.074
open to interpretation.

01:03:54.176 --> 01:03:54.977
Yeah.

01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:56.779
Here I am.

01:03:59.081 --> 01:04:00.182
A free spirit after all.

01:04:01.283 --> 01:04:02.084
No.

01:04:04.053 --> 01:04:05.854
Free spirits do
not fear judgment.

01:04:07.323 --> 01:04:08.290
And so what are you?

01:04:10.226 --> 01:04:12.429
Someone who's risking
the chance for paradise

01:04:12.462 --> 01:04:14.263
in the next life to be
with you in this one.

01:04:26.308 --> 01:04:29.412
The office in Rome sends
a new list every month.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.947
And if your husband's
name is on it,

01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:33.450
I promise I will call you.

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:40.856
You have a daughter?

01:04:46.128 --> 01:04:47.162
God has been good to you.

01:05:08.884 --> 01:05:11.421
Enough for today.

01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:14.056
- Let's go home.
- What about the post?

01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:17.860
It can wait.

01:05:24.933 --> 01:05:26.201
I'll get the chips,
you get the curry?

01:05:36.045 --> 01:05:38.047
Hello.
Two specials, please.

01:05:51.226 --> 01:05:52.194
Thank you.

01:05:54.963 --> 01:05:55.864
Lilly.

01:05:57.132 --> 01:05:58.033
Lilly!

01:05:59.536 --> 01:06:01.337
Hi.

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.105
I was just having dinner.

01:06:03.138 --> 01:06:03.972
Right.

01:06:05.408 --> 01:06:06.875
Would you like to join me?

01:06:06.909 --> 01:06:08.977
We have to go,
it's getting cold.

01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.513
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:06:10.547 --> 01:06:12.582
Amina Mergessa,
Lilly's best friend.

01:06:12.615 --> 01:06:15.317
Robin Sathi, I work with
Lilly at the hospital.

01:06:15.351 --> 01:06:16.251
Ah.

01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:21.290
Please, we won't keep
you from your dinner.

01:06:21.323 --> 01:06:23.560
- Yes, it's waiting right there for you.
- Lilly!

01:06:23.593 --> 01:06:27.363
Amina, it's...
it's fine.

01:06:27.397 --> 01:06:30.999
And Lilly, you're right.
A chicken dhansak as fine as Ananda's

01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:33.068
should not be
allowed to get cold.

01:06:33.102 --> 01:06:35.438
Amina, I truly hope
we meet again soon.

01:06:35.472 --> 01:06:36.506
As do I.

01:06:41.977 --> 01:06:43.178
What is wrong with you?

01:06:44.246 --> 01:06:46.315
How could you be so rude to him?

01:06:46.348 --> 01:06:49.284
I don't know, there's something
about him I find very irritating.

01:06:49.318 --> 01:06:51.554
I thought he was a lovely man,
perfect gentleman.

01:06:51.588 --> 01:06:53.155
Yes, too perfect.

01:06:53.188 --> 01:06:54.557
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Stop!

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:57.394
There is no one for me but Aziz.

01:07:03.298 --> 01:07:05.934
Ahmed,
bring me my glasses.

01:07:05.968 --> 01:07:08.237
- I don't know where they are.
- Look for them!

01:07:09.706 --> 01:07:11.173
They're
probably in her bag!

01:07:16.345 --> 01:07:17.179
Ahmed!

01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:29.992
When I tell you
to do something...

01:07:36.566 --> 01:07:37.366
Ahmed...

01:07:39.034 --> 01:07:40.637
you're going
back to Mrs. Chilolo's.

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:42.004
But she doesn't have TV.

01:07:42.772 --> 01:07:43.939
Now, Ahmed!

01:07:46.074 --> 01:07:47.242
Do what your Auntie says.

01:08:24.246 --> 01:08:26.247
Your husband is alive, Amina.

01:08:29.452 --> 01:08:30.986
He won't be able to look at me.

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.188
You don't understand.

01:08:34.756 --> 01:08:36.526
Yusuf is a scholarly man.

01:08:36.559 --> 01:08:38.359
- So?
- He knows the Qur'an.

01:08:38.394 --> 01:08:40.028
And so do you.

01:08:40.062 --> 01:08:42.296
It says that if someone
is forced to do something,

01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:44.366
like you were,
they're not guilty if a sin.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.435
Forced!

01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:48.770
When Yusuf hears what
happened he'll understand.

01:08:48.805 --> 01:08:51.006
I didn't fight, Lilly.

01:08:52.774 --> 01:08:54.109
I didn't fight.

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:59.214
I walked into their barracks
and I offered myself to them.

01:08:59.247 --> 01:09:01.751
- You did it to protect your son.
- Stop.

01:09:01.783 --> 01:09:03.553
What would you say to any
other woman in that camp?

01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:06.321
If she had done
what she could do

01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:08.558
to survive because
she knew her life was sacred.

01:09:09.792 --> 01:09:11.326
That it was a gift from Allah.

01:09:13.462 --> 01:09:15.296
She would never leave
her child all alone.

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:17.934
What would you say to her?

01:09:21.804 --> 01:09:22.705
I would say...

01:09:24.807 --> 01:09:26.341
I would tell her she was right.

01:09:27.676 --> 01:09:28.645
That she did the right.

01:09:29.812 --> 01:09:31.113
The right thing.

01:09:34.484 --> 01:09:36.151
What if he doesn't want Sitta?

01:09:38.153 --> 01:09:40.221
You said that Yusuf believed
he must always strive

01:09:40.255 --> 01:09:41.624
to do better in the eyes of God.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.060
Isn't that right?

01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:48.865
Yes.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.301
Then give him
the chance to do that.

01:09:55.538 --> 01:09:56.606
He's alive.

01:10:01.477 --> 01:10:04.480
- <i>Alhamdulillah.</i>
- <i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

01:10:49.324 --> 01:10:50.493
I don't have the words.

01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:54.897
If you only had a minute to tell
him everything you needed to...

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.868
what would you tell him?

01:11:01.838 --> 01:11:02.839
About Sitta?

01:11:03.973 --> 01:11:06.274
Yes, about Sitta.

01:11:06.308 --> 01:11:08.745
And about learning
that he's alive.

01:11:18.253 --> 01:11:19.389
I would tell him...

01:11:29.399 --> 01:11:31.401
now that I know
that he survived...

01:11:33.403 --> 01:11:36.706
I can let myself remember just
how much we loved each other.

01:11:40.275 --> 01:11:42.845
How he taught me
about photosynthesis.

01:11:45.848 --> 01:11:47.617
How I taught him how to dance.

01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:44.272
Are you sure?

01:13:30.653 --> 01:13:31.921
Move against me.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.467
Are we in love?

01:14:22.638 --> 01:14:23.573
I am.

01:14:25.608 --> 01:14:26.609
How do you know?

01:14:29.745 --> 01:14:31.080
It is a feeling.

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:34.784
Right here.

01:15:56.699 --> 01:15:57.667
What is it?

01:16:06.943 --> 01:16:09.578
Munir and I are not
returning to Harar.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.183
Things are happening in the north,
we can't just watch from afar anymore.

01:16:14.216 --> 01:16:16.686
- What about the hospital?
- This is more important.

01:16:18.087 --> 01:16:21.223
We're going to fight for people
who can't fight for themselves.

01:16:23.659 --> 01:16:25.561
Lilly, as soon as you get back,

01:16:25.594 --> 01:16:28.898
Munir's uncle will put
you on a bus to Djibouti.

01:16:28.931 --> 01:16:32.201
Refugees are flocking there because
they have a British consulate,

01:16:32.234 --> 01:16:35.104
but you shouldn't be there
more than a few weeks.

01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:37.707
The color of your skin will put
you at the head of the line.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:38.774
Why?

01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:41.610
Lilly, why do you think?

01:16:42.578 --> 01:16:43.646
You are white!

01:16:44.814 --> 01:16:46.716
You can go to England
and be anything you want to be.

01:16:46.749 --> 01:16:49.085
You don't have...
you don't have to be Ethiopian.

01:16:49.118 --> 01:16:50.252
You don't even
have to be Muslim.

01:16:50.286 --> 01:16:52.588
How can I be anything else?

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.695
- I'm not leaving.
- Lilly...

01:16:59.729 --> 01:17:01.030
I'm going back to
Nouria's to wait for you...

01:17:01.063 --> 01:17:03.065
You have been seen
at the meetings!

01:17:03.099 --> 01:17:05.501
If I'm taken,
they might come for you next.

01:17:06.335 --> 01:17:08.304
And if they find you with
Nouria, you'll be putting her

01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:09.805
and Bourtoucan in danger, too.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.941
Last night in Addis...

01:17:14.176 --> 01:17:17.546
the army executed
60 political prisoners.

01:17:18.881 --> 01:17:19.749
60!

01:17:20.983 --> 01:17:22.952
Over 50 of them were
their own generals.

01:17:24.286 --> 01:17:26.088
I need to know you're
somewhere safe.

01:17:29.992 --> 01:17:33.729
Did you know you were
leaving me... before?

01:17:37.767 --> 01:17:40.636
Everything is changing
so fast, Lilly.

01:17:41.937 --> 01:17:43.105
Does that really matter?

01:17:44.273 --> 01:17:45.174
Of course it does.

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:03.025
It's not enough.

01:18:06.996 --> 01:18:08.230
But it's all I have
to give for now.

01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:15.571
So you won't forget me.

01:18:16.906 --> 01:18:19.108
This won't last long.

01:18:19.141 --> 01:18:21.110
There are too many
of us for them to fight.

01:18:22.211 --> 01:18:25.147
I promise, as soon as I can,
I'll come find you.

01:18:30.052 --> 01:18:30.986
We have to go.

01:18:32.788 --> 01:18:33.889
Lilly, now!

01:18:35.157 --> 01:18:37.626
<i>...100,000
people died of starvation</i>

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.694
<i>in northern Ethiopia.</i>

01:18:40.696 --> 01:18:42.731
<i>Not long after, civil unrest</i>

01:18:42.765 --> 01:18:44.767
<i>resulting from
economic pressures,</i>

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.203
<i>brought an end to Emperor
Haile Selassie's regime</i>

01:18:47.236 --> 01:18:48.637
<i>and the military took over.</i>

01:18:50.372 --> 01:18:53.209
<i>Now the same civilians who
helped bring about change</i>

01:18:53.242 --> 01:18:57.012
<i>are being imprisoned without
charge, tortured, and executed.</i>

01:18:58.214 --> 01:19:01.317
<i>And the ruling military party
has virtually closed off</i>

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:03.285
<i>the country from
the outside world</i>

01:19:03.319 --> 01:19:05.821
<i>as they continue
to jostle for power.</i>

01:19:15.364 --> 01:19:16.832
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:16.866 --> 01:19:18.267
Hello, I'm calling
to check on a potential

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.035
arrival from Ethiopia.

01:19:20.069 --> 01:19:22.104
Dr. Aziz Abdulnassar.

01:19:22.138 --> 01:19:24.106
<i>Is he
on the latest list?</i>

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.442
No, he's not on
the most recent list,

01:19:25.475 --> 01:19:27.143
but I know there have been
several flights since...

01:19:27.176 --> 01:19:29.812
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Please, if you'll just check...

01:19:29.845 --> 01:19:31.381
- <i>You hold, please.</i>
- I've been on hold.

01:19:31.414 --> 01:19:33.082
<i>You must hold.</i>

01:19:33.115 --> 01:19:34.016
All right.

01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:50.467
<i>♪ Just bring it on up ♪</i>

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.101
<i>♪ Bring it on up ♪</i>

01:19:53.836 --> 01:19:55.704
<i>♪ Just bring it on up ♪</i>

01:19:57.806 --> 01:19:58.841
What's going on?

01:20:01.243 --> 01:20:03.879
One of Vertise's
boy's birthdays.

01:20:03.913 --> 01:20:05.915
Don't ask me which one.

01:20:05.948 --> 01:20:06.815
I need to sit.

01:20:47.056 --> 01:20:47.657
Yusuf?

01:20:50.826 --> 01:20:52.429
What have they done to you?

01:20:53.496 --> 01:20:56.165
Yusuf! What have they done?

01:20:56.198 --> 01:20:57.400
It's all right.

01:21:02.104 --> 01:21:03.172
My love.

01:21:06.842 --> 01:21:10.045
You didn't write back.
Why didn't you write to me?

01:21:10.079 --> 01:21:13.015
All I could think about
was seeing your face.

01:21:14.517 --> 01:21:17.554
- My love.
- Why didn't you write?

01:21:17.587 --> 01:21:20.490
I'm sorry, I wanted
to surprise you.

01:21:24.893 --> 01:21:25.794
Is that Sitta?

01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:29.466
Is that our daughter?

01:21:39.275 --> 01:21:40.342
Oh, Sitta!

01:21:45.214 --> 01:21:46.015
Sitta.

01:21:48.485 --> 01:21:49.351
It's your Papa.

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:02.931
I've come to take you
to your new home.

01:22:06.969 --> 01:22:09.204
Sitta, you'll love Alberta.

01:22:30.259 --> 01:22:32.094
When the Great Abdal told me

01:22:32.127 --> 01:22:33.530
he was going to give me a home,

01:22:35.097 --> 01:22:36.499
I demanded to know why.

01:22:39.602 --> 01:22:41.303
I was just
a little thing, but...

01:22:43.305 --> 01:22:45.908
I told him he couldn't
tell me it was God's will,

01:22:47.009 --> 01:22:49.144
because my mother had told me
there wasn't any god.

01:22:50.079 --> 01:22:50.913
Was he angry?

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.582
What did he say?

01:22:55.184 --> 01:22:57.252
He said that
all I needed to know...

01:22:58.488 --> 01:23:03.292
was that his heart and my
heart were very old friends.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.028
Like yours and mine.

01:23:49.539 --> 01:23:51.541
Plenty of time, plenty of time.

01:23:56.646 --> 01:23:57.580
My darling.

01:23:59.114 --> 01:24:01.049
- How are you?
- Good morning.

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:02.017
Hello, you.

01:24:07.457 --> 01:24:08.991
- Watch the basket.
- Okay.

01:24:15.665 --> 01:24:18.601
Cookies for my precious
Ahmed, and for Sitta.

01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:21.937
Shh.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.341
You have been so good to us.

01:24:27.577 --> 01:24:28.411
So good.

01:24:37.787 --> 01:24:39.622
Amazing, yes?

01:24:39.656 --> 01:24:41.123
What the body can endure.

01:24:43.393 --> 01:24:44.159
And the spirit.

01:24:47.764 --> 01:24:49.566
Amina told me about
your young man.

01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:53.168
I know nothing.

01:24:55.237 --> 01:24:57.674
He could be in a prison
like you were, I don't know.

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:01.343
Let's hope so.

01:25:15.391 --> 01:25:17.359
I'm going in front.

01:25:17.393 --> 01:25:20.630
You will sit in the back
with me and your sister.

01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:22.297
Your mother must
ride in comfort.

01:25:27.403 --> 01:25:29.338
I can't even look at you.

01:25:41.718 --> 01:25:43.051
It's time.

01:26:00.403 --> 01:26:03.506
<i>Inshallah</i> we shall
see each other again my sister.

01:26:04.641 --> 01:26:06.108
<i>Inshallah.</i>

01:28:15.872 --> 01:28:17.172
Aziz!

01:28:41.263 --> 01:28:43.966
There he is. Uncle Djimon is
here to get you out of the country.

01:28:45.702 --> 01:28:46.301
Lilly?

01:28:49.639 --> 01:28:50.540
I can't just leave.

01:29:08.658 --> 01:29:10.393
Nouria! Nouria!

01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:55.438
May I?

01:29:57.006 --> 01:29:58.775
There isn't one other seat.

01:30:00.576 --> 01:30:01.444
See for yourself.

01:30:08.084 --> 01:30:09.752
This may be the first
time I've seen you in here

01:30:09.786 --> 01:30:11.654
when you haven't had
a book right in your face.

01:30:13.422 --> 01:30:15.825
You must really like them?

01:30:18.861 --> 01:30:21.329
Books, I, I assume.

01:30:23.566 --> 01:30:25.635
- You're right.
- I like books, too.

01:30:27.403 --> 01:30:31.073
Well, I'm in a bit of a,
a science fiction rut,

01:30:31.107 --> 01:30:33.910
you know, Bradbury,
Asimov, Le Guin.

01:30:33.943 --> 01:30:35.378
Perhaps you could
recommend a change of...

01:30:35.411 --> 01:30:36.445
No, I can't.

01:30:38.981 --> 01:30:39.816
That's too bad.

01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:44.120
I thought perhaps literature

01:30:44.153 --> 01:30:46.022
might just be
the conversational ticket.

01:30:51.561 --> 01:30:52.428
I'm sorry.

01:30:54.831 --> 01:30:55.731
I don't mean to bother you.

01:30:59.836 --> 01:31:02.538
It was, it was
a pleasure almost having

01:31:02.572 --> 01:31:04.040
a conversation with you,
Miss Abdal.

01:31:38.474 --> 01:31:40.042
I'm sorry.

01:31:40.076 --> 01:31:41.377
I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

01:31:42.712 --> 01:31:43.913
I have no appointment.

01:31:44.847 --> 01:31:46.148
Please, come in.

01:31:56.726 --> 01:31:57.960
Please, have a seat Mr...

01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:00.129
My name is Tariq.

01:32:01.764 --> 01:32:03.532
This is the right place?

01:32:03.566 --> 01:32:04.734
You are Lilly Abdal?

01:32:04.767 --> 01:32:06.736
Yes, please come in.

01:32:07.670 --> 01:32:08.571
Thank you.

01:32:17.046 --> 01:32:19.148
What can I help you with?

01:32:19.181 --> 01:32:20.650
Are you trying to find someone?

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.821
I'll make you some coffee.

01:32:31.494 --> 01:32:35.498
I was held in a prison
near the Somali border.

01:32:36.766 --> 01:32:38.601
I was not there long before...

01:32:40.503 --> 01:32:41.938
A guard beat me in such a way...

01:32:43.739 --> 01:32:45.007
that when he finished...

01:32:46.842 --> 01:32:48.911
there was only darkness.

01:32:52.281 --> 01:32:53.616
I could no longer see.

01:32:56.118 --> 01:32:57.553
Then the doctor came.

01:33:01.157 --> 01:33:05.094
He had been part of the resistance
to the military takeover.

01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:08.764
He too was a prisoner.

01:33:09.732 --> 01:33:10.766
He was tortured.

01:33:12.001 --> 01:33:12.969
But even so...

01:33:14.804 --> 01:33:16.105
he cared for all of us.

01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:24.113
He promised... my blindness
would not last.

01:33:37.326 --> 01:33:38.227
You see?

01:33:40.262 --> 01:33:41.097
He did not lie.

01:33:43.799 --> 01:33:45.001
He was the best man.

01:33:47.269 --> 01:33:48.537
Because of him...

01:33:50.806 --> 01:33:54.577
many of us were
spared further pain.

01:33:58.114 --> 01:33:59.949
Do you know what
happened to him?

01:34:06.589 --> 01:34:07.590
A day came...

01:34:09.625 --> 01:34:11.060
when a guard

01:34:11.093 --> 01:34:14.196
took many of us
into a courtyard.

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:16.932
They told us we would
have a good show.

01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:36.952
"Counter-revolutionary."

01:34:36.986 --> 01:34:38.087
That's what they called us.

01:34:43.659 --> 01:34:44.560
But then...

01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:47.863
they brought him out.

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:51.734
The doctor.

01:34:55.037 --> 01:34:57.139
He would not die on his knees.

01:36:09.479 --> 01:36:11.680
Lilly, I'm going to get Zema!

01:36:40.377 --> 01:36:41.411
What are you doing here?

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.416
First, drink.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:53.756
You managed to get
quite dehydrated

01:36:53.789 --> 01:36:56.225
with a doctor in the next room.

01:36:56.258 --> 01:36:58.428
I might have to reconsider
my career choice.

01:37:03.766 --> 01:37:05.134
Mm-mm, keep going.

01:37:11.307 --> 01:37:12.241
There you go.

01:37:20.883 --> 01:37:22.284
Now tell me.

01:37:22.318 --> 01:37:23.252
Please.

01:37:24.353 --> 01:37:26.222
Right.

01:37:28.257 --> 01:37:30.359
Someone named Senit

01:37:31.293 --> 01:37:33.295
found you on the floor
outside your flat.

01:37:35.398 --> 01:37:39.768
She got your spare key
from someone named Vertise,

01:37:39.802 --> 01:37:42.938
who then called Mrs. Jahangir,

01:37:42.972 --> 01:37:46.476
who then called Amina in Canada,

01:37:46.509 --> 01:37:49.979
and she called the hospital
and tracked down...

01:37:51.448 --> 01:37:52.281
me.

01:37:55.284 --> 01:37:56.852
That means I must
have told Senit.

01:38:00.089 --> 01:38:01.257
I believe you did, Lilly.

01:38:03.892 --> 01:38:05.027
So everyone knows?

01:38:07.464 --> 01:38:08.398
Everyone knows.

01:39:29.978 --> 01:39:32.214
I see you've found some
new reading material.

01:39:38.655 --> 01:39:39.622
I never thanked you.

01:39:41.624 --> 01:39:42.958
Not properly.

01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:44.594
For recommending
science fiction?

01:39:45.961 --> 01:39:46.995
For taking care of me.

01:39:49.632 --> 01:39:51.166
There's no need.

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.000
Of course there is.

01:39:54.169 --> 01:39:57.306
Well then I believe
I should thank you, as well,

01:39:57.339 --> 01:40:01.276
for inspiring me to expand
my literary horizons.

01:40:02.445 --> 01:40:03.912
Sufi poetry.

01:40:05.981 --> 01:40:07.916
So you see,

01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:10.453
it's a,
it's a good deal all around.

01:40:33.710 --> 01:40:34.943
When I was seven years old,

01:40:36.446 --> 01:40:38.080
my parents took me to Morocco.

01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:43.453
We went to a Sufi shrine
at the edge of the Sahara.

01:40:47.356 --> 01:40:50.025
They left me there,
and they never came back.

01:40:56.666 --> 01:40:58.033
It wasn't until years later

01:40:58.066 --> 01:40:59.334
that I found out what
happened to them.

01:41:02.037 --> 01:41:04.507
And even then, all I was told

01:41:04.541 --> 01:41:07.610
was that drugs were involved,
and that they died together.

01:41:13.115 --> 01:41:14.451
I don't, I don't
know what to say.

01:41:15.385 --> 01:41:16.351
It's all right.

01:41:18.187 --> 01:41:20.289
I was happy there.

01:41:26.094 --> 01:41:27.329
And I was loved.

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.067
I would have stayed
there forever if I could.

01:41:46.716 --> 01:41:49.586
Of course I can call back,

01:41:49.619 --> 01:41:51.521
but it will be to speak
with your supervisor.

01:41:56.392 --> 01:42:00.563
<i>Lilly, how much there is
to tell you about Alberta.</i>

01:42:00.597 --> 01:42:03.198
<i>Today, I met
a woman in the market,</i>

01:42:03.232 --> 01:42:04.567
<i>we reached for
the same melon.</i>

01:42:06.703 --> 01:42:08.638
<i>She came here alone from Chile</i>

01:42:08.671 --> 01:42:11.373
<i>after her family was killed
during the military coup.</i>

01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:15.612
<i>She said she has put
down roots here,</i>

01:42:15.645 --> 01:42:19.281
<i>and in that moment,
I knew I could do that too.</i>

01:42:20.249 --> 01:42:23.285
<i>And not just because I ended
up with the melon!</i>

01:42:28.357 --> 01:42:31.326
<i>We are branches from
the same tree, my sister.</i>

01:42:32.395 --> 01:42:36.566
<i>We must plant ourselves
where we are,</i>

01:42:36.599 --> 01:42:40.068
<i>and know in our hearts
that we are home.</i>
