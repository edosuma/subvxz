[logo music]

00:03.871 --> 00:06.774
[music playing]

00:11.379 --> 00:20.621
Two-- three.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.491
[laughter]

00:26.360 --> 00:27.228
Hi.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.497
Shh!

00:29.530 --> 00:30.898
Choppers radar?

00:30.931 --> 00:31.799
Good.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.234
It's quiet.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.835
I've been driving Andy
around in the car.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.405
Took me 45 minutes to
finally get him to nap.

00:37.438 --> 00:40.241
The motion of the car
lulls him to sleep.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.410
Yeah, we used to go for drives
when our kids couldn't sleep,

00:42.443 --> 00:43.744
too.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.547
Of course, we never wrecked
it by bringing them with us.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.015
Just trying to
make your babysitting

00:48.048 --> 00:50.451
job a little easier, Roseanne.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.854
OK, a couple things--

00:53.887 --> 00:55.055
Oh, great.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.056
A list.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.458
Well, at least
I'll have something

00:57.491 --> 01:01.962
to look out while I'm on hold
with the poison control center.

01:01.995 --> 01:05.065
Uh, you can see, I've divided
things into three categories--

01:05.099 --> 01:06.734
food, sleep, and recreation.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.503
Jackie, food and
sleep are recreation.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.406
OK, first-- under food, Andy
is not allowed to have cheese,

01:12.440 --> 01:14.342
preservatives, fat, or sugar.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.111
Well, I wasn't planning
on cooking for the kid.

01:17.145 --> 01:20.548
So I've got celery sticks,
carrot sticks, and rice cakes.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.715
And if you just
stick to this diet,

01:21.749 --> 01:23.784
then he's not going to fuss.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.786
He doesn't need all
this fiber, Jackie.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.022
He's barely got a colon.

01:29.056 --> 01:29.990
Aw, sweetie.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.459
Bye bye, sweetie.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.860
I'd better go.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.196
Uh, if he wakes up early and you
want to get him back to sleep,

01:35.229 --> 01:38.499
then you can either say,
um, Moomy wuvs Boo-boo,

01:38.532 --> 01:41.369
or you say, um, Boo-boo,
ticky ticky ticky.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.105
Well, she's gone.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.574
You can quit faking it.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.442
ANDY: Ha hey!

01:48.476 --> 01:50.511
I thought so.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.979
Mm, ticky ticky.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.046
That's all you're getting, kid.

01:56.350 --> 02:00.654
Here, I know what you want.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.056
No, no, no, wait a minute.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.759
Yeah!

02:05.793 --> 02:06.827
Here you go.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.766
[laughter]

02:15.369 --> 02:18.739
[theme song]

02:55.543 --> 02:57.010
[laughing]

02:58.011 --> 03:00.881
[music playing]

03:03.951 --> 03:06.019
Hi.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.221
Jeez, Deej.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.522
Whatever it is you
got in your jacket,

03:08.556 --> 03:10.824
I hope it's not that
virus-infected monkey

03:10.858 --> 03:12.260
the whole town's
been looking for.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.327
Leave me alone!

03:13.361 --> 03:15.529
Yeah, what's under there, huh?

03:15.563 --> 03:18.799
Mom doesn't have you defrosting
a roast again, does she?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.601
I'm not going to
show you what is.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.102
You're just going
to make fun of me.

03:22.135 --> 03:25.973
Son, they're already
making fun of ya.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.041
OK!

03:28.075 --> 03:29.777
Hey, it's your pictures
from photography club.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.678
Look at this.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.012
We're all in here.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.981
Yeah, we're supposed to
capture the true essence

03:34.014 --> 03:35.649
of our subjects.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.584
Hey, what's this one?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.586
Oh, that's Darlene's fist.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.254
Oh, yeah!

03:40.288 --> 03:41.955
You can see the scabs
were the knuckles

03:41.989 --> 03:45.993
have dragged on the ground.
- Jeez, DJ.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.796
It's really rude to take a
picture of someone's butt.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.598
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's Becky's face.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.403
And here's a good
shot to you, Mr. Conner,

03:55.436 --> 03:56.937
sitting in your chair
in front of the TV

03:56.970 --> 04:00.374
with a cold beer in your hand.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.210
[laughter]

04:04.278 --> 04:06.380
No empties on the floor.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.215
Must have just started.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.017
[laughter]

04:11.018 --> 04:12.586
Hey, Roseanne!

04:12.620 --> 04:14.355
Come on in and look
at DJ's photo album.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.289
It's really good.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.590
ROSEANNE: Bring
it in the kitchen.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.125
Nah, you come in here.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.026
ROSEANNE: Come on, Dan.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.295
Just this once, do it my way.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.195
Come on.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.964
I had a long shift today.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.198
ROSEANNE: I'm pregnant!

04:25.232 --> 04:26.834
I'm tired!

04:26.867 --> 04:28.936
ROSEANNE: Do you really
want me to come in there?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.809
[laughter]

04:40.848 --> 04:45.018
[belches] Good thing
I needed another beer.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.520
[laughter]

04:46.554 --> 04:47.488
Here.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.558
Check it out.

04:50.591 --> 04:54.528
Oh-- I've always wanted
pictures of the family.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.829
Hand me a pen there.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.532
Mustache time.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.000
There I am.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.235
Pretty nice shot, hah?

05:02.269 --> 05:04.538
Yeah, well, you're just
kind of sitting like a lump

05:04.572 --> 05:07.074
in your chair with a beer.
- Yep.

05:07.107 --> 05:10.177
Just like in high
school yearbook.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.447
Let's see what other action
poses he's got me in.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.649
No, looks like that's it.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.185
Guess you haven't given him
much opportunity for a photo

05:18.218 --> 05:19.987
shoot ever since your
synchronized swimming

05:20.020 --> 05:20.821
group broke up.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.426
Well, I'm sure there
must be some others.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.796
He was supposed to capture
the essence of his subject.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.164
Well, now, here you are
in your chair with a beer.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.934
I think that about covers it.

05:33.967 --> 05:34.902
I don't get it.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.604
Is this all he thinks of me?

05:36.637 --> 05:40.007
He's got two pictures
of the mailman in here.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.108
Well, yeah.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.411
Well, the mailman has
two sides, you know?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.112
Here he is delivering
the mail and then

05:45.145 --> 05:47.848
here he is picking up the mail.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.216
Not funny.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.485
DJ thinks I'm a lump.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.654
Well, then do
something about it.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.955
Like what?

05:54.988 --> 05:57.858
Do I have to put on a Harry
Chapin album for you, Dan?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.460
Spend time with him.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.360
Yeah.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.495
Maybe.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.797
Couldn't hurt to spend
some time with the boy.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.866
Show him I'm every bit as
complex as the mailman.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.436
DJ, get in here!

06:08.469 --> 06:10.103
I mean, what boy
wouldn't want to learn

06:10.137 --> 06:11.639
what his dad's all about?

06:11.672 --> 06:12.540
I don't know.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.207
Little Skippy Hitler?

06:14.241 --> 06:16.376
[laughter]

06:16.410 --> 06:19.112
Buddy, you and I are
going to have some fun.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.047
Ow!

06:20.080 --> 06:22.850
How many of those has he had?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.217
[laughter]

06:24.251 --> 06:25.252
Guess what?

06:25.285 --> 06:26.620
We're spending the
afternoon together.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.521
Why?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.489
What did I do wrong?

06:28.522 --> 06:29.890
What are you guys up to?

06:29.923 --> 06:32.025
Well, we're going to throw the
old ball around a little bit.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.361
Thought I'd show DJ
what made the old man

06:34.394 --> 06:36.964
third team all-state.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.065
Help me.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.434
Yeah, so grab the ball
there, bottom shelf.

06:40.468 --> 06:43.303
I'll show you how to
throw a perfect spiral.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.773
[laughter]

06:45.806 --> 06:48.709
Aaand-- you're ready to go!

06:48.742 --> 06:50.143
Are we through?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.211
No, we're going to the store.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.613
We're going to buy a ball.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.881
Do we have to?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.315
- Yes, it'll be fun.
- But I don't wanna go--

06:55.348 --> 06:56.249
Get in the car!

06:56.283 --> 06:57.150
All right!

06:57.184 --> 06:58.619
Just don't hit me again!

06:58.652 --> 07:00.521
[laughter]

07:00.554 --> 07:02.389
How is my little Andy?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.759
How my baby-- you
been goody good?

07:05.793 --> 07:06.860
[giggles]

07:06.894 --> 07:08.128
Yes.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.597
All except for that one little
incident with the matchy

07:09.630 --> 07:11.431
matches.
- Oh!

07:11.465 --> 07:13.333
Baby!

07:13.366 --> 07:14.735
[sniffs]

07:14.768 --> 07:15.669
Oh my god.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.205
[sniffs] Honey--

07:18.238 --> 07:20.608
Roseanne--

07:20.641 --> 07:22.843
My child has Oreo breath.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.078
[laughter]

07:25.112 --> 07:26.079
Well, relax.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.581
That's just 'cause
we were drinking

07:27.615 --> 07:28.949
an Oreo-flavored liqueur.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.453
You gave him Oreos?

07:33.487 --> 07:35.489
Roseanne, what about my list?

07:35.523 --> 07:38.826
I specifically asked you not
to feed him any junk food.

07:38.859 --> 07:39.760
Hey!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.629
You could spit and
you could swear

07:41.662 --> 07:43.897
and you can even take
the Lord's name in vain,

07:43.931 --> 07:45.398
but you will not
come in my house

07:45.432 --> 07:48.235
and refer to Oreos as junk food.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.970
[laughter]

07:50.971 --> 07:52.540
I am serious, Roseanne.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.108
How would you feel if
you left instructions

07:55.142 --> 07:58.546
for the care of your child and
somebody just ignored them?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.781
Well, if I had
never raised a kid

08:00.814 --> 08:02.616
and I left him with somebody
who had raised three,

08:02.650 --> 08:03.817
I'd feel pretty
damn good about it.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.919
Well, somehow I don't!

08:05.953 --> 08:07.621
Hey, you're getting
him back alive,

08:07.655 --> 08:10.190
and that wasn't
even on your list.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.425
[laughter]

08:12.459 --> 08:16.564
I don't care about
Andy being alive!

08:16.597 --> 08:18.832
[laughter]

08:18.866 --> 08:20.133
Calm down, Jackie.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.468
I used to do stuff
like that and give

08:21.501 --> 08:22.670
my kids cookies all the time.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.404
Well, maybe that's
the reason your kids

08:24.437 --> 08:26.039
turned out the way they did.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.608
What the hell's
wrong with my kids?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.209
Nothing-- if you're
trying to reverse

08:29.242 --> 08:30.978
the process of evolution.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.746
[laughter]

08:33.947 --> 08:35.583
Well, if that's the
way you feel about it,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.785
maybe you just shouldn't bring
your kid around here anymore.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.119
Well, maybe that
is fine with me.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.088
Maybe I don't want my kid
turning out the way yours did.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.091
It's like-- smart-ass
high school drop out,

08:44.124 --> 08:48.395
trailer trash, dark
clothes wearing,

08:48.428 --> 08:52.365
boyfriends in the basement,
too soon sex doing,

08:52.399 --> 08:54.935
four-letter wording,
hoodlum Oreo

08:54.968 --> 08:56.303
eaters-- that's what you are!

08:56.336 --> 08:57.270
The whole family!

08:57.304 --> 08:58.706
The whole lot of ya!

08:58.739 --> 08:59.607
Oreo eaters.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.374
And you!

09:01.408 --> 09:02.976
You are the Oree--

09:03.010 --> 09:04.612
oiest!

09:04.645 --> 09:07.080
[laughter]

09:07.114 --> 09:09.449
[applause]

09:12.019 --> 09:14.888
[music playing]

09:18.692 --> 09:19.960
Hi, guys.

09:19.993 --> 09:20.794
How's it goin'?

09:23.697 --> 09:26.466
Hey, thanks for the ride.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.868
How are things at home?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.537
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.504
How's Mom doing?

09:31.538 --> 09:32.572
She OK?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.842
Because, you know, I
was just wondering.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.876
Hey 7:00's great.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.811
Maybe we can catch a movie.
- OK!

09:37.845 --> 09:38.712
OK.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.680
I see your point.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.014
I see exactly what's
going on here.

09:41.048 --> 09:45.552
[laughs] OK, what's
going on here?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.055
We heard what you said
to Mom about us yesterday.

09:48.088 --> 09:53.126
Oh god, I've got this
voice that carries!

09:53.160 --> 09:54.995
What's wrong with Andy
turning out like us?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.363
Come on, guys.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.831
You gotta know-- I
didn't mean that.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.732
Right?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.567
Guys!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.736
You really hurt us, OK?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.772
I didn't mean to hurt you.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.507
I meant to hurt your Mom.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.642
Well, yeah.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.943
But you've taken something
really beautiful,

10:09.977 --> 10:13.113
like hurting our mom, and
turned it into something ugly.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.049
[laughs nervously]

10:16.083 --> 10:17.450
Good one, Darlene!

10:17.484 --> 10:19.352
So I can see that you're not
really that upset with me

10:19.386 --> 10:20.788
because you're still
joking with me.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.090
Right?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.926
Actually, I'm-- I'm
still a little upset.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.060
I mean, I don't
know how I'm going

10:27.094 --> 10:28.829
to be at waiting on customers.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.664
Becky, you say no
more, because I am

10:30.698 --> 10:31.932
going to take over your shift.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.803
Now you two get on out of
here and go have some fun.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.305
[sighs] I was kind of
counting on that money.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.273
Fine, uh, you
can have my tips!

10:40.307 --> 10:41.474
Well, gee.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.311
I mean, that'll make Becky
feel better, I guess.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.213
[laughter]

10:47.815 --> 10:50.217
That's, uh-- $26.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.284
It's all I got.
- Cool, bye.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.185
See ya.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.553
OK, OK.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.222
I love you guys.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.456
I love you two.

10:56.489 --> 11:00.694
Oh my god, I hope Andy
doesn't turn out like them.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.030
[music playing]

11:05.065 --> 11:07.968
This is where it
all happens, DJ.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.838
This is the hub of the Lanford
Transportation Department.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.706
If you see me sitting
in that chair at home,

11:12.740 --> 11:15.675
it's because I've spent a long
day here working diligently.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.145
Hey, that lady on
that calendar's naked!

11:18.178 --> 11:21.514
Well-- can't blame her, DJ.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.785
August is the hottest month.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.854
DJ, where'd you
get the shiner?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.221
Dad threw a ball at me.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.122
To you!

11:29.156 --> 11:30.023
To you.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.158
[laughs nervously]

11:32.692 --> 11:34.561
Hey, how 'bout it, Deej?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.930
Why don't you climb up on
an official city vehicle.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.399
Dad, I ride in one
of these every day.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.300
You're kidding.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.635
Where do you go?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.905
[laughter]

11:44.938 --> 11:47.640
Hey, I bet you never seen
this part of the bus!

11:47.674 --> 11:48.541
Whoa!

11:48.575 --> 11:49.609
This stuff is huge!

11:49.642 --> 11:50.811
You fix this?

11:50.844 --> 11:51.711
Oh, better yet--

11:51.745 --> 11:53.346
I'm the supervisor.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.948
I got seven guys under me.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.050
And they'd better do
what I say or else.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.618
I'll write 'em up and--

11:58.651 --> 12:02.389
18 infractions later,
there will be a hearing.

12:02.422 --> 12:06.426
So you just sit in a chair
and watch guys fix stuff.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.761
Well, yeah.

12:07.795 --> 12:11.431
The way a king sits on a throne
and watches his knights--

12:11.464 --> 12:14.167
fix stuff.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.169
[laughter]

12:16.203 --> 12:17.504
Mark, what are you doing?

12:17.537 --> 12:19.940
Oh, I'm making a sugar
trail for the ants.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.576
And they're going for
it, the stupid bastards.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.512
Don't you have
something better to do?

12:25.545 --> 12:28.015
Well, I guess I could go
shoot staples in the spider web.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.182
Oh, I'm comin' with!

12:29.216 --> 12:30.183
No, hold on, boy.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.019
You're here with me.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.155
And you haven't seen how we
get around those EPA rules

12:35.188 --> 12:37.690
on the disposal of
toxic materials.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.859
Do I have to?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
Yeah.
Come on.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.094
It'll be great.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.495
Go on outside.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.199
The water out there is all
the colors of the rainbow.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.535
I want to go back to school.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.436
Do you want a root beer?

12:49.469 --> 12:50.737
How 'bout a root beer?

12:50.770 --> 12:54.641
Yeah, I guess so.

12:54.674 --> 12:55.775
Heads up!

12:55.809 --> 12:56.676
[thump]

12:56.709 --> 12:58.879
DJ: Ow!

12:58.912 --> 13:01.581
That was your
good eye, wasn't it?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.884
[music playing]

13:05.385 --> 13:07.154
I couldn't help myself.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.958
I just fell in love with
these jolly, jolly clowns.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.560
They're so antic, like
they just came tumbling

13:13.593 --> 13:15.528
out of a little tiny car.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.231
It's something the baby
can remember me by.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.667
She'll remember you every
Saturday when the whole family

13:20.700 --> 13:22.970
goes dancing on your grave.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.305
[laughter]

13:25.338 --> 13:27.474
That doesn't bother me, dear.

13:27.507 --> 13:32.479
I know those are just your
pregnancy hormones talking.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.948
My hormones actually
want to kill you, Mom.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.383
And they're out in the
front yard right now

13:36.416 --> 13:38.285
looking for a big stick.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.719
Water off the duck's back!

13:39.752 --> 13:42.789
Quack, quack, quack!

13:42.822 --> 13:43.690
Coast clear?

13:43.723 --> 13:44.958
Is she gone?

13:44.992 --> 13:46.293
When did you come in?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.794
Oh, about, uh, 40 minutes ago.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.529
I was just waiting
till Mom left.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.664
Well, if you're
looking for my kids,

13:51.698 --> 13:54.902
uh, the girls are turning
tricks at the trailer court--

13:54.935 --> 13:56.369
[laughter]

13:56.403 --> 14:00.874
--and DJ's out back
skinning rabbits.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.509
Roseanne, wait.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.245
I came over here to apologize.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.214
I was way over the
line about your kids.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.883
I think they're terrific.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.786
And I also think that
you're a really good mom.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.122
Really?

14:15.155 --> 14:17.357
Well--

14:17.390 --> 14:20.760
Well, maybe my kids are
a little screwed up.

14:20.793 --> 14:24.431
I mean-- I'll admit that.

14:24.464 --> 14:28.168
But if they are, it's all
Dan's fault, you know.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.239
Did you know he
hit DJ with a ball?

14:32.272 --> 14:35.976
So I just wanted you to
know that-- that I was sorry.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.211
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.680
I, uh-- really should
have followed your list.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.115
Oh, thanks for
saying that, Roseanne.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.984
See, that makes me
feel so much better.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.186
It's like you
respect my mothering.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.087
Yeah.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.421
I mean, it's your kid.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.558
If you tell me to put him in
a pink dress and tap shoes,

14:51.591 --> 14:52.892
I should do it.

14:52.926 --> 14:53.893
Well, no.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.028
I mean, that would
be a silly thing.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.930
The things on my
list aren't silly.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.632
Those are serious parenting
issues that I've researched

14:59.666 --> 15:02.402
and feel strongly about.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.537
Whatever.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.474
It's on the list,
I oughta do it.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.143
Uh, no-- 'cause
there's this odd

15:10.177 --> 15:11.811
tone in your voice
there that seems

15:11.844 --> 15:13.646
to be belittling the list.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.449
Like there's something-- keeps
getting caught in your throat

15:16.483 --> 15:18.818
that is most likely
holding back laughter

15:18.851 --> 15:20.487
inside the rest of you.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.855
No, that's not laughter
back there, Jackie.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.058
That's a little piece of Oreo.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.559
[laughter]

15:27.560 --> 15:30.830
I was right about the Oreo!

15:30.863 --> 15:32.065
No, you weren't.

15:32.099 --> 15:35.068
You are totally, totally
going overboard about this.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.137
It's one crummy
cookie, and I already

15:37.170 --> 15:38.871
had ate the middle out of it!

15:38.905 --> 15:40.073
Ugh!

15:40.107 --> 15:43.110
It-- It is symptomatic of
something more serious,

15:43.143 --> 15:44.311
Roseanne.

15:44.344 --> 15:48.181
You substitute cookies and
candy and junk for love.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.082
Oh, please.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.483
You do!

15:50.517 --> 15:52.952
I am willing to admit, I have
got a lot to learn about being

15:52.986 --> 15:54.854
a mother, but so do you.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.590
I had-- a lot to learn.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.593
And I learned it,
and now I'm done!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.595
[laughter]

16:02.629 --> 16:06.099
That is such a--

16:06.133 --> 16:08.101
[angry laugh]

16:08.135 --> 16:11.038
That's what that is!

16:11.071 --> 16:12.505
Jackie, stop it!

16:12.539 --> 16:13.773
Stop this instant!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.508
Stay out of it, old woman!

16:15.542 --> 16:17.010
[laughter]

16:18.211 --> 16:20.447
I will not have you
upsetting Roseanne when

16:20.480 --> 16:23.116
she's in this fragile state!

16:23.150 --> 16:24.384
You tell her, Mom.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.488
And she keeps
looking at me, too.

16:28.521 --> 16:32.459
Just get out of here, Jackie,
with all your hatred and anger.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.593
Shoo, shoo!

16:33.626 --> 16:34.627
Don't touch me, Mom!

16:38.231 --> 16:40.200
Accidents happen.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.035
[laughter]

16:42.069 --> 16:46.506
I can't understand
why she's doing that.

16:46.539 --> 16:53.480
Now, you just get all comfy and
Mother will make it all better.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.981
She's not one of us, Mom.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.849
She never was.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.051
Are we done?

16:58.085 --> 17:01.054
Or is there a bag of nails
you'd like you show me?

17:01.088 --> 17:02.589
[laughter]
- No, son.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.490
You're free.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.393
Go run with the ants.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.760
He hates me.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.196
I couldn't be duller.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.631
You could golf.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.401
Going to the garage
was a huge disaster.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.136
So I tried taking
him to other places

17:16.169 --> 17:18.605
that might capture my essence--

17:18.638 --> 17:21.074
the bowling alley, the Lobo.

17:21.108 --> 17:24.511
I even took him to the quarry
where I used to go swimming.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.214
You never used to
swim at the quarry.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.749
At that point, I
was making stuff up.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.050
[laughter]

17:32.051 --> 17:33.586
It's a lost cause.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.555
I'm giving up.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.690
I'm just going to
relax and grab a beer--

17:37.724 --> 17:38.591
BEVERLY: Ding, ding, ding!

17:38.625 --> 17:40.793
It's the Good Humor woman!

17:40.827 --> 17:42.429
--in Canada.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.363
Ice cream!

17:43.396 --> 17:44.331
Yay!

17:44.364 --> 17:45.532
I have to admit it.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.201
I kind of like it when you
and Jackie have a tiff.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.903
It gives me a chance to do
some mothering of my own.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.004
Ah!

17:52.038 --> 17:57.677
I almost forgot-- a
crumbled cookie on top.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.614
When you were a little girl,
this would always comfort you

18:01.648 --> 18:02.449
when you were upset.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.825
Um-- So tell me, Mom.

18:12.859 --> 18:18.431
Did you ever try any
other ways to comfort me?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.700
Well, you know
how it is with kids.

18:20.733 --> 18:24.204
When you find something that
works, you stick with it.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.104
Yeah.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.739
So why try anything else.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.574
Right, Ma?

18:33.012 --> 18:37.517
If I'm cooking dinner,
I'd better go to the store.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.019
Ta-ta!

18:40.052 --> 18:40.920
[door shutting]

18:43.022 --> 18:43.890
[sighs]

18:58.638 --> 18:59.506
Hello, Jackie.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.374
I know you're not home, yet.

19:01.408 --> 19:05.212
I just wanted to say, I'm
sorry about the Oreo stuff.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.846
I was wrong.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.816
Um-- Maybe I'm not
a perfect mother.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.753
Um, maybe I still have a
whole bunch of stuff to learn.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.587
Bye.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.534
[sighs]
