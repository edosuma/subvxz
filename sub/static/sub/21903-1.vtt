I hate to say I told you so,
but if we'd stayed home

01:52.113 --> 01:54.738
we would be in our pajamas
with some ice cream

01:54.865 --> 01:56.824
watching a Nicholas Sparks
movie right now, girl.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.700
I'm just saying that
if we did that

01:58.828 --> 01:59.785

the blond beauty.

Did you tell him that, TJ?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.847
Uh, you're gonna wanna hold on

02:19.974 --> 02:21.390
walking in those shoes.
We got a ways to go.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.226

sure Minnie gets there alright.

Yeah, and I'm pretty sure
you have some idea why.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.078
Actually, I have zero idea

03:25.206 --> 03:26.246
why you get to be
the one who's angry

03:26.373 --> 03:27.998

03:32.922 --> 03:34.046
You wanna talk?

03:34.173 --> 03:37.090
Did you know...that we were
gonna be here

03:37.218 --> 03:39.176
because honestly, if I'd known
you were gonna be here

03:39.303 --> 03:41.053
I just wouldn't have..

03:41.180 --> 03:43.096

someone was a gentleman.

we're in the right place?

to find the booze.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.856

that his daddy bought for him.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.571
- You go to Mariner?
- 'What?'

where he goes to school?

from her dad earlier.

Her mom's allergic to bees.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.113
She carries one of those
things everywhere.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.198
Yeah, but there's no bees here.

business. It was a mistake.'

- It happens, okay?
- Yeah.

09:56.305 --> 09:59.097
Don't listen to anything
that they're saying.

- Just..
- Yeah, I..

I don't know why I'm here.
That's all.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.399
Just forget it, okay?
Let's just watch TV.

- 'Meg, I already checked.'
- What's that?

might help you relax.

So, I decided I'd, uh,
get a little help.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.948
You cheated?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.909
Uh, no, Vivian.
Don't worry. I didn't cheat.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.286
Okay, you remember that,
uh, that girl

11:45.414 --> 11:47.247
she used to follow me
around campus?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.331
(Ben)
'Always quiet.
Didn't talk much.'

11:48.458 --> 11:51.501
Right. So, she had the midterm

11:51.628 --> 11:53.795
before lunch
and I had it after lunch.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.382
So, all I had to do was pretend
to date her for two weeks.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.719
And then she gave me
the answers.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.595
'Problem solved. Right?'

12:02.723 --> 12:04.431
Dude, that's not cool
at all, man.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.975
You're a class act.
You know that?

12:07.102 --> 12:08.476
What? I.. What?

12:08.603 --> 12:10.562
I mean, I mean, she got-she got
something out of it too.

12:10.689 --> 12:11.604
I-I gave her a night
to remember.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.524
- You okay, Teej?
- Yeah, I'm good.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.318
I'm just trying to find a movie
to shut this guy up.

12:18.697 --> 12:19.571
Hey, what's your problem, man?

12:19.698 --> 12:20.697
Look, nobody wants to hear you

12:20.824 --> 12:22.198
talk about how you used
some chick.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.826
- 'No, obviously I--'
- TJ! Look, you found a DVD?

12:24.953 --> 12:26.494
Nice job, Teej.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.330
You guys both come
sit with me on the couch.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.542
(Lori)
'What's the movie?'

12:32.669 --> 12:34.335
Doesn't look like it's marked.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.129
Could be porn.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.465
It's probably a bootlegged copy.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.466
And showtime.

Lori, you okay?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.239
Who did this?

13:45.242 --> 13:46.324
'It's not..'

13:47.786 --> 13:49.285
You don't think
I know what that means?

13:49.412 --> 13:50.703
Whoa, calm down.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.580
Don't tell me
to calm down, Nathan.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.672

14:00.799 --> 14:03.675

sold your own soul

winning that competition.

I'm leaving. I don't want
to be anywhere near you liars.

Uh..

14:22.070 --> 14:23.653
...it's been a weird night.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.864
Let's call it. Alright?

14:25.991 --> 14:27.782
Everyone get some rest, okay?

14:46.845 --> 14:50.096
I, uh, saved this room for you.

14:50.223 --> 14:50.597
Of course you did.

14:54.269 --> 14:54.601
Yeah, thanks.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.769
Welcome.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.776
Mins, you should take your meds.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.236
Yeah.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.451
You always think of everything.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.290
So, Ben's pretty cute, right?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.416
'Hmm.'

15:19.085 --> 15:21.085
I guess. I mean,
he definitely dyes his hair

15:21.212 --> 15:23.296
by the look of those eyebrows.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.590
I'm just sayin'. You guys
would make a really cute couple.

15:27.135 --> 15:27.842
Um, Ben's..

15:27.969 --> 15:29.594
Ben's not important, Meg.

TJ.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.548
Oh. Yeah. Me neither.

It's a lie with Ben.

you just didn't like

might not be coming.

prove anything.

for a signal?

to go to the other house.

a working phone there.

come too because I know

25:19.268 --> 25:21.810
<i>that I'm better than she is.</i>

25:21.938 --> 25:23.395
<i>But that bitch was jealous.</i>

25:23.523 --> 25:26.815
<i>She must've seen the way</i>
<i>the boy looked at me.</i>

25:26.943 --> 25:28.484
<i>She wanted him for herself.</i>

25:28.611 --> 25:31.278
<i>She threatened to make</i>
<i>my life at school a living hell</i>

25:31.405 --> 25:32.863
<i>if I didn't quit.</i>

25:32.990 --> 25:35.199
<i>She called me a weak link</i>

25:35.326 --> 25:36.951
<i>but she knew that</i>
<i>I was better than her.</i>

25:37.078 --> 25:39.078
<i>Who isn't?</i>

25:39.205 --> 25:41.455
<i>She said she didn't want</i>
<i>to wait for me to slip</i>

25:41.582 --> 25:43.874
<i>but I never slip.</i>

25:44.001 --> 25:46.585
<i>She will.</i>
<i>And everyone will laugh.</i>

25:55.137 --> 25:55.427
(TJ)
'Meg.'

26:04.689 --> 26:06.146
- You ready?
- Yeah.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.691
Guys, um, if you find a radio,
you just need to let--

26:08.818 --> 26:09.275
I'll let you know.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.653
I'll let you know.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.868
(Meg)
So, how do you know
where we're going?

26:19.996 --> 26:22.162
(TJ)
I've been here before.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.081
Right. With Jessica?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.543
(TJ)
With a group.
With a group of us.

26:28.462 --> 26:29.420
(Meg)
Right.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.925
While I was getting changed,
I was thinking about

26:35.052 --> 26:36.427
how Minnie and I met
for the first time.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.431
Really? I don't think
I've heard that story before.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.808
Well, I was put on the PE team

26:42.935 --> 26:44.435
with Minnie
and Jessica Lawrence.

26:44.562 --> 26:47.605
It didn't take
more than 20 minutes

26:47.732 --> 26:48.439
for Jessica to decide
I was lame

26:48.566 --> 26:51.525
so she made Minnie choose.

26:52.486 --> 26:53.402
Her. Or me.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.365
(TJ)
She made the right choice.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.076
(Meg)
Well, thank you,
but I'm shocked she chose me.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.411
A day doesn't go by where
I don't think about that moment

27:02.538 --> 27:05.080
and how different
my life would be

27:05.207 --> 27:08.125
if she'd just made the choice
that 99 out of a 100 other kids

27:08.252 --> 27:09.501
would choose every single time.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.836
Watch out.

27:12.006 --> 27:12.963
You're wrong.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.381
Yeah,
that's easy for you to say.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.718
When have you ever had
to try to fit in?

27:17.845 --> 27:19.011
Find something to belong to

27:19.138 --> 27:19.970
or struggle
to get someone's attention?

27:20.097 --> 27:22.973
Hey, that's not fair, alright?

27:23.100 --> 27:24.099
You don't think I know
what it's like to have to work

27:24.226 --> 27:25.351
to get someone's attention?

27:25.478 --> 27:26.852
No, I think you know
exactly what it's like

27:26.979 --> 27:28.729
to work to get
someone's attention.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.564
And then, an hour later,
you're on to another.

27:30.691 --> 27:33.692
Another. Then another.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.736
You know, I think
you find it very convenient

27:35.863 --> 27:37.780
to hide behind the story
about you and Minnie

27:37.907 --> 27:39.698
every time she treats you
like crap

27:39.825 --> 27:41.408
so that you can avoid
dealing with the truth.

27:41.535 --> 27:44.870
Okay. And what's the truth?

27:44.997 --> 27:47.706
No matter how much
you want to fight it, Meg

27:47.833 --> 27:49.083
you are your own person
with unique thoughts

27:49.210 --> 27:52.670
and individuality that somebody
might actually like.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.297
And believe me, that somebody
doesn't like you for some

27:55.424 --> 27:56.799
middle school transfer story

27:56.926 --> 28:00.427
or any loyal act
you've done for them.

28:00.554 --> 28:01.679
They like you for you.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.681
Don't analyze me, okay?

28:05.518 --> 28:08.352
I don't need you
to always try and save me, TJ.

28:08.479 --> 28:09.937
In fact,
I don't need anyone to save me.

28:10.064 --> 28:10.938
[dramatic music]

28:11.065 --> 28:12.106
[both grunt]

28:13.734 --> 28:14.817
Hang on!

28:15.528 --> 28:16.985
[grunting]

28:18.864 --> 28:20.197
You okay?

28:22.785 --> 28:24.993
- Damn it.
- 'What?'

28:25.746 --> 28:27.162
Flashlights.

28:27.289 --> 28:28.455
Near the patio door.
We'll need them.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.624
I gotta go back. Stay here.

28:30.751 --> 28:31.375
No. Hell no, I'm not stay..

28:39.051 --> 28:40.592
[chuckles]

28:45.933 --> 28:47.766
[instrumental music]

28:50.813 --> 28:53.772
- You okay?
- Huh! Yeah.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.618
[instrumental music]

29:25.055 --> 29:26.346
Ah!

29:40.321 --> 29:42.154
I'm good. I'm good.

30:02.802 --> 30:06.178
Well, hey,
at least there's plenty of gas.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.763
If we have to drive
this thing outta here

30:07.890 --> 30:10.182
at least we'll have the fuel.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.433
It's beautiful.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.811
Yeah.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.814
This is a Bruno Whitney.
Late '50s, at least.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.608
I mean, wooden hull,
Portuguese bridge.

30:19.735 --> 30:20.776
'I mean, this entire thing
is a collector's item.'

30:21.821 --> 30:24.154
'Come on.'

30:24.281 --> 30:26.114
Didn't know you knew
so much about boats.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.200
I don't know, I..

30:28.327 --> 30:31.495
I guess I don't share
much about it.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.997
I can see why.
It's kinda nerdy. He-he.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.376
Alright.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.503
- Oh, no, TJ, I didn't..
- Mm-hmm.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.004
No, come on. I'm a writer.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.799
I'm way nerdier than you
for Christ sake.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.343
Like, you-you don't even want to
see my comic book collections.

30:47.304 --> 30:50.430
Well, I don't think you're
a nerd. Not even a little.

30:53.060 --> 30:57.437
I, uh, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

30:57.565 --> 31:00.816
How we haven't talked much
since...homecoming, but I'm--

31:00.943 --> 31:04.403
Um, I honestly haven't wanted
to hear about homecoming.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.488
Wait. Wait, so, you don't
even know what happened?

31:08.993 --> 31:10.033
'I mean, I guess I was pissed.'

31:10.160 --> 31:12.494
'That's why I avoided you
at first, but..'

31:14.206 --> 31:14.746
...I missed you.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.082
'So much.'

31:18.294 --> 31:19.376
Since Gunner and Minnie broke up

31:19.503 --> 31:21.253
I never get to see you anymore.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.464
I guess what
I'm trying to say is--

31:24.592 --> 31:27.968
TJ, we need
to find the radio, okay?

31:28.095 --> 31:29.720
And then...get back
to the house.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.972
Right.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.937
That's, uh, that's weird.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.982
- What?
- It's just, uh, radio's gone.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.234
Been removed.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.944
Actually,
been removed rather recently.

31:48.198 --> 31:49.448
[sighs]
Okay. Well, what about the boat?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.824
Can we just, I don't know,
drive it out of here?

31:50.951 --> 31:53.535
No keys.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.078
Well, maybe the keys
are somewhere.

31:55.205 --> 31:55.913
You know, honestly,
I doubt it, Meg.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.789
TJ, we should still look.

31:59.084 --> 31:59.958
Fine.

32:01.587 --> 32:02.544
Hey!

32:05.174 --> 32:07.758
(TJ)
'I'll bet that's the same paint
from the wall up at the house.'

32:07.885 --> 32:09.801
TJ, the radio, the paint.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.224
- What do we do now?
- We go back.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.903
Hey, TJ. Wait.

32:30.324 --> 32:31.657
I'm sorry.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.453
Listen, you've always
been a great friend.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.039
Friend? That's what I am?

32:41.251 --> 32:44.336
Uh, that's what
I'd like to think, yeah.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.758
You know,
I'm starting to think that..

32:49.885 --> 32:51.093
...I'm never going to get you.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.345
Well, maybe I'm just ungettable.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.932
And maybe
you're not used to that.

32:57.059 --> 32:58.266
What's that supposed to mean?

32:58.394 --> 33:01.061
I'm just saying maybe
Mr. All-State Football Star

33:01.188 --> 33:03.939
isn't used to not being
worshipped. You know?

33:04.066 --> 33:05.899
Again, not fair.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.986
For who? You or me?

33:09.530 --> 33:11.196
Look, you have no idea
what it's like being me.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.950
And you have no idea
what it's like to be me.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.577
You're right. But I'd like to.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.210
[dramatic music]

33:35.514 --> 33:37.597
[panting]

33:37.725 --> 33:39.057
- You don't want to see this.
- 'Oh, my gosh! No.'

33:49.653 --> 33:51.069
This could've been you.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.282
Yeah, maybe.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.661
TJ, I don't think
this was an accident.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.165
Meg..

34:03.292 --> 34:04.958
...she slipped and fell.

34:05.085 --> 34:05.959
It was slippery, alright?
You know this for yourself.

34:14.803 --> 34:15.427
Something must have cut it.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.344
Something or someone?

34:19.141 --> 34:21.016
- What?
- I don't know.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.185
Maybe you're being paranoid.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.895
If it had been cut by a stone

34:25.022 --> 34:27.022
it wouldn't have been
cut so cleanly, TJ.

34:27.149 --> 34:28.774
So, what are you saying?

34:28.900 --> 34:29.940
Huh? Someone purposely
followed Vivian

34:30.069 --> 34:31.150
who was following us,
to cut the rope?

34:31.277 --> 34:33.779
No, I'm just..

34:33.906 --> 34:34.654
I'm just saying
it's a possibility

34:34.782 --> 34:35.989
that this wasn't an accident.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.286
Should we tell everyone?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.663
We have enough
to deal with right now.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.373
Let's just get
the hell off this island.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.293
We should be
alright from here.

35:00.516 --> 35:04.434

<i>It literally sucks</i>
<i>the air from my lungs.</i>

35:04.561 --> 35:06.978

35:43.642 --> 35:44.474
Yo.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.185
You find anything?

35:54.820 --> 35:55.110
You do that?

35:58.532 --> 35:59.573
What the hell?
You think this is funny?

35:59.700 --> 36:01.700
- Huh? Answer me!
- Get off her, man!

36:01.827 --> 36:03.201
- Hey! Don't, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.661
- Touch her again, you die!
- Enough!

36:04.788 --> 36:05.245
Stop it! Stop! The both of you.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.289
Where's TJ, huh?

36:07.416 --> 36:09.624
She did it. She did it.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.501
I caught her.

36:11.628 --> 36:12.252
[exhales]
I didn't do anything.

36:12.379 --> 36:15.338
Nah. No, she was here.

36:15.465 --> 36:18.216
And that mark
wasn't there before.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.844
No, it's not possible.
She's trailing mud.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.387
Nothing even close to the wall.

36:24.433 --> 36:25.932
Don't touch me again.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.062
What's going on in here?

36:33.901 --> 36:34.191
[dramatic music]

36:42.534 --> 36:44.492
Alright..

36:44.620 --> 36:45.493
...we need to come together

36:45.621 --> 36:47.245
and think
about this collectively.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.874
The way I see it,
it's every man for himself.

36:51.001 --> 36:53.960
Dude, we're talking
about accidents.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.213
Those marks on the wall
didn't get there by accident.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.926
What are you saying?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.260
I wanna see the body, okay?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.556
I need to see Vivian.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.317
[instrumental music]

37:26.495 --> 37:29.204
Alright, storm's over.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.539
I'm going to the other house.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.334
Don't be daft. The footbridge
is out. You won't make it.

37:34.461 --> 37:37.337
Great. You don't have to come.
In fact, you shouldn't.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.798
I'm just saying there's
already been two deaths--

37:39.925 --> 37:41.132
Accidents.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.634
Okay, accidents

37:42.761 --> 37:44.761
and I'm not gonna
stick around for another one.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.138
Hey, don't loop me in with them.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.890
Minnie.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.101
Listen, I-I don't know
what you guys think is actually

37:51.228 --> 37:54.187
going on here,
but two people have died

37:54.314 --> 37:56.189
and she has been there
for both of them. I mean..

37:56.316 --> 37:58.692
- How can you not see that?
- Excuse me, I found them both.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.193
(Nathan)
'You know what?'

38:00.320 --> 38:02.070
Some might say
that's the same thing, Meg.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.490
Meg, where were you when Lori..

38:07.536 --> 38:10.745
I was upstairs, sleeping.

38:10.872 --> 38:11.579
Isn't that right, Minnie?

38:11.707 --> 38:13.873
How am I supposed to know?

38:14.001 --> 38:16.042
You're supposed to know
because you were there.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.544
I was sleeping, Meg.

38:17.671 --> 38:20.755
I don't know what you're doing
or thinking in the dark.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.300
There you go.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.930
[dramatic music]

38:36.523 --> 38:38.231
Why didn't you defend me?

38:39.568 --> 38:41.318
I'm always defending you.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.322
You do realize they accused me
of killing them, right?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.159
'Minnie.'

38:50.871 --> 38:53.371
- You don't think--
- No...I don't think.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.583
That's your job. Right?

38:57.336 --> 38:58.209
[sighs]

39:03.675 --> 39:04.632
[sighs]

39:04.760 --> 39:06.634
[dramatic music]

39:32.537 --> 39:35.121
I mean, I-I can't just sit
here and wait.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.334
Well, technically,
you're standing. Yeah.

39:44.466 --> 39:46.925
What the hell is this?

39:52.432 --> 39:54.140
<i>(Claire)</i>
<i>He didn't just</i>
<i>smile at me this time.</i>

39:54.267 --> 39:55.725
<i>He saw me.</i>

39:55.852 --> 39:57.852
<i>Not a singer. Not a debater.</i>

39:57.979 --> 40:00.021
<i>Me. The real me.</i>

40:00.816 --> 40:04.234
<i>He doesn't seem like it,</i>
<i>but my boy is shy.</i>

40:04.361 --> 40:05.652
<i>His friend approached me</i>
<i>after class</i>

40:05.779 --> 40:07.445
<i>and asked if I wanted</i>
<i>to meet him for coffee.</i>

40:07.572 --> 40:10.073
<i>He's showing me</i>
<i>sides of himself</i>

40:10.200 --> 40:12.075
<i>that no one else gets to see.</i>

40:12.202 --> 40:14.744
<i>Finally,</i>
<i>someone sees the real me.</i>

40:14.871 --> 40:17.622
<i>Finally,</i>
<i>I belong to something.</i>

40:17.749 --> 40:20.417
<i>All of life comes down</i>
<i>to simple choices.</i>

40:20.544 --> 40:21.835
<i>He asked me</i>
<i>to do something that</i>

40:21.962 --> 40:24.045
<i>anyone else would</i>
<i>think is wrong.</i>

40:24.172 --> 40:26.381
<i>But I'm not everyone else.</i>

40:26.508 --> 40:27.382
<i>I already made my choice.</i>

40:28.510 --> 40:30.343
<i>It's the right one.</i>

40:32.848 --> 40:33.513
<i>I don't understand.</i>

40:33.640 --> 40:35.557
<i>I gave him his answers.</i>

40:35.684 --> 40:36.975
<i>I helped him with his test.</i>

40:37.102 --> 40:38.476
<i>Why is this happening</i>
<i>to me again?</i>

40:38.603 --> 40:42.021
<i>Why is it that every time</i>
<i>I do something right</i>

40:42.149 --> 40:43.440
<i>everything goes to ...?</i>

40:43.567 --> 40:45.775
<i>He stopped returning my texts.</i>

40:45.902 --> 40:46.693
<i>I saw his friend</i>
<i>and told him that</i>

40:46.820 --> 40:49.571
<i>I needed to speak to my boy.</i>

40:49.698 --> 40:51.322
<i>He must not have told him.</i>

40:51.450 --> 40:52.740
<i>He didn't have</i>
<i>a girlfriend of his own.</i>

40:52.868 --> 40:54.909
<i>He must've been jealous too.</i>

40:55.036 --> 40:58.246
<i>Can anyone ever be anything</i>
<i>but jealous?</i>

40:58.373 --> 40:58.872
<i>I should have hit him.</i>

40:58.999 --> 41:00.498
<i>Someone will.</i>

41:02.210 --> 41:04.502
<i>Now, I understand.</i>

41:04.629 --> 41:06.504
<i>All the pain</i>
<i>of never getting anything</i>

41:06.631 --> 41:09.174
<i>was nothing</i>
<i>compared to the pain</i>

41:09.301 --> 41:11.134
<i>of getting something</i>
<i>and losing it.</i>

41:11.261 --> 41:13.428
<i>There's no remedy</i>
<i>for being burned.</i>

41:13.555 --> 41:15.305
<i>Except for being shot</i>
<i>through the heart.</i>

41:15.432 --> 41:17.182
<i>At least that's quicker.</i>

41:18.560 --> 41:20.477
What is that?

41:28.028 --> 41:29.777
[instrumental music]

41:31.573 --> 41:32.447
Okay.

41:43.502 --> 41:44.709
[sighs]

41:59.976 --> 42:01.726
[music continues]

42:19.371 --> 42:19.536
Where were you?

42:22.207 --> 42:23.456
- I just went to my room.
- Stop.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.584
- What?
- Please.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.670
Look, you wanna be angry
at me for what happened?

42:28.797 --> 42:32.131
There wasn't a lot that I could
control about homecoming night.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.759
But if you want
to hold it against me

42:34.886 --> 42:37.929
for the rest of my life,
you know what? Fine.

42:38.056 --> 42:41.432
Listen, TJ, I-I can't
do this right now, okay?

42:41.560 --> 42:42.559
I don't even know what happened
homecoming night.

42:42.686 --> 42:45.395
I only know what I heard.

42:45.522 --> 42:46.563
I never wanted to know
and I never asked, okay?

42:46.690 --> 42:48.565
'Well, hear me out then.'

42:48.692 --> 42:50.441
Please just go talk to Minnie.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.151
Minnie? Minnie.

42:52.279 --> 42:54.320
What does Minnie
have to do with any of this?

42:54.447 --> 42:54.654
[Minnie screaming]

42:57.576 --> 42:59.075
[gasping]

43:01.413 --> 43:02.620
Who's missing?

43:05.083 --> 43:06.082
(Minnie)
'Ben, where are you?'

43:06.209 --> 43:07.333
- Ben?
- Ben?

43:07.460 --> 43:08.668
Meg. Maybe you should
check the bedrooms.

43:08.795 --> 43:10.503
I'll check his room.

43:10.630 --> 43:13.464
[dramatic music]

43:18.597 --> 43:21.055
[sobbing]

43:21.182 --> 43:24.100
Minnie. Minnie, back away.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.311
(Minnie)
'Three people are dead.'

43:26.438 --> 43:28.605
Listen, Minnie, you haven't
been taking your meds.

43:28.732 --> 43:31.399
'You just need to breathe,
okay?'

43:31.526 --> 43:34.193
- We'll get you away from him.
- Is that what I need to do?

43:34.321 --> 43:35.945
You always know what's best,
don't you, Meg?

43:37.824 --> 43:40.783
You think that I don't know
what's been going on here?

43:40.910 --> 43:41.909
We have a better chance
of figuring this out together--

43:42.037 --> 43:44.787
No, I'm not talking
about that, Meg.

43:44.914 --> 43:47.332
You wanted to go off to college

43:47.459 --> 43:51.002
and dump me
into someone else's hands.

43:51.129 --> 43:53.338
- Wait, what?
- Tried to pawn me off on Ben.

43:53.465 --> 43:57.550
You wanted me to be his problem
now, instead of yours.

43:57.677 --> 44:00.011
- You wanted to abandon me.
- That's-that's not true.

44:00.138 --> 44:03.973
Now, he's gone,
and I know who to blame.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.686
Meg. Hey, Meg,
you gotta see this.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.192
Taste it.

44:19.616 --> 44:21.407
- It tastes like--
- Pecans.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.291
Come on.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.293
[indistinct chatter]

44:40.470 --> 44:44.555
Hey!
This wasn't an accident, was it?

44:44.683 --> 44:47.141
It wasn't.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.811
We're starting to run a little
low on suspects, aren't we?

44:49.938 --> 44:52.480
Okay, what,
what are you implying?

44:52.607 --> 44:55.358
Those other ... left.

44:55.485 --> 44:57.318
There's only five people
in this house

44:57.445 --> 44:58.611
who could have done this.

44:58.738 --> 44:59.862
- This is crazy.
- Well, where were you both?

44:59.989 --> 45:02.323
(Gunner)
'K, that's not cool.'

45:02.450 --> 45:04.033
TJ is my best friend, okay?

45:04.160 --> 45:06.369
He wouldn't do
something like this.

45:06.496 --> 45:07.453
I'm not saying he did anything.

45:07.580 --> 45:08.538
I'm just asking.

45:08.665 --> 45:10.039
I could ask you
the same question.

45:10.166 --> 45:13.793
Okay. We were together.
In my room.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.920
You were both together
when you found Vivian too.

45:16.047 --> 45:18.256
That's enough.
We don't have to listen to this.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.383
Yeah, because I know
we didn't do anything.

45:20.510 --> 45:23.177
And I know
neither did Gunner or me.

45:23.304 --> 45:25.012
So, that just leaves one person.

45:25.890 --> 45:29.767
Did you see her? She's grieving.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.687
What I saw was someone
who is off her meds.

45:32.814 --> 45:34.147
Well, she's my friend.

45:34.274 --> 45:35.940
Oh, she's got a funny way
of showing it.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.192
- You know what..
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

45:38.319 --> 45:38.943
Okay?

45:39.070 --> 45:41.988
All I'm saying is that

45:42.115 --> 45:44.699
nobody has been together
for the entire time.

45:44.826 --> 45:46.576
'So, nobody can be certain.'

45:46.703 --> 45:48.453
'Why don't you just
remember that?'

45:49.956 --> 45:51.664
What's wrong with you?
Why didn't you back me up?

46:00.842 --> 46:04.469
You know, Kumiko wasn't wrong.

46:04.596 --> 46:05.720
She's wrong.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.019
Our best option?

46:13.146 --> 46:14.729
We go to that other house
before we lose sunlight.

46:14.856 --> 46:17.148
TJ, Nathan and Kenny
already went--

46:17.275 --> 46:18.775
If Nathan and Kenny
would've found something

46:18.902 --> 46:19.776
they would have
come back by now.

46:23.031 --> 46:26.199
Which means they could be the
ones responsible for all this.

46:28.036 --> 46:29.744
There's only one way
to find out the truth.

46:40.173 --> 46:41.506
[instrumental music]

46:41.633 --> 46:43.216
We don't want to lose
the light, my dear.

46:46.262 --> 46:48.638
TJ, have you ever
doubted something

46:48.765 --> 46:50.223
but deep down
still wondered if it's true?

46:53.019 --> 46:55.561
Yeah, all the time.

46:55.688 --> 46:59.106
Okay, well, I think Minnie
was right, back at the house.

46:59.234 --> 47:00.650
You're a good friend to her.

47:00.777 --> 47:01.359
Am I?

47:01.486 --> 47:03.319
Because the truth is

47:03.446 --> 47:06.697
I could've gone to school here.

47:06.825 --> 47:08.199
I mean, there are plenty
of writing programs

47:08.326 --> 47:11.244
that would have taken me,
but I didn't even consider 'em.

47:12.831 --> 47:15.665
Why, if I'm such
a good friend to her?

47:15.792 --> 47:18.125
Look, there's nothing
wrong with wanting

47:18.253 --> 47:21.087
to forge your own identity,
you know?

47:21.214 --> 47:23.714
You can do that from LA.

47:23.842 --> 47:26.425
I've just been Minnie's friend,
Meg, for so long.

47:26.553 --> 47:29.554
I don't know if there's
anything else I can offer.

47:32.976 --> 47:35.977
Wait, how'd you know
I was going to UCLA?

47:37.480 --> 47:38.479
Um..

47:38.606 --> 47:42.108
Just, uh, heard around, I guess.

47:42.235 --> 47:45.111
Hmm. Well, you must be
excited about Washington.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.197
Uh, not exactly.
I'm going to USC.

47:50.451 --> 47:53.119
We're going to be
neighbors in SoCal.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.455
I've been wanting
to tell you all weekend.

47:56.583 --> 47:57.206
I just, I don't know.

47:59.586 --> 48:01.335
Why'd you change your mind?

48:01.462 --> 48:03.629
I don't know.

48:03.756 --> 48:05.631
[chuckles]
TJ, tell me why.

48:07.343 --> 48:08.885
Same reason you want
to go to LA.

48:09.012 --> 48:11.137
So I can make my own way.

48:11.264 --> 48:12.555
Plus, you know,
USC said they might

48:12.682 --> 48:14.807
let me start at wide receiver.

48:14.934 --> 48:16.642
Doesn't hurt that
I'll know somebody nearby too.

48:20.356 --> 48:22.189
Hey. Slow down.

48:22.317 --> 48:24.317
[laughs]
Slow down.

48:24.444 --> 48:25.484
You gotta keep up, girl.

48:25.612 --> 48:26.444
[wings fluttering]

48:27.447 --> 48:30.364
[dramatic music]

48:30.491 --> 48:34.035
Come on. Come on. We gotta..

48:34.162 --> 48:35.828
The house is just up this way.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.502
[knocking]

48:43.630 --> 48:45.504
(Meg)
'Hello!'

48:49.761 --> 48:50.301
TJ.

48:56.392 --> 48:57.600
Where?

48:58.895 --> 49:01.562
- Wait. Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

49:01.689 --> 49:02.313
[upbeat music]

49:02.440 --> 49:04.357
(TJ)
What the..

49:06.527 --> 49:08.361
It's exactly 4:30.

49:08.488 --> 49:11.072
TJ, it's on a timer.

49:11.199 --> 49:13.157
That means, there's no one here.

49:18.581 --> 49:20.373
Which means
that whoever did this--

49:20.500 --> 49:21.457
Killed Lori, Vivian and Ben.

49:36.015 --> 49:38.808
[sighs]
It's charged. No phone line.

49:40.019 --> 49:40.977
'Wait a minute.'

49:41.104 --> 49:43.062
What are Jessica's
parent's names?

49:43.189 --> 49:44.480
Uh, her dad's name is John.

49:44.607 --> 49:46.691
- Mom's name is something like--
- Jean?

49:46.818 --> 49:48.067
Yeah, Jean.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.782
This...this looks like
the number to White Rock House.

49:54.909 --> 49:56.909
I mean..

49:57.036 --> 49:58.828
...it looks like they called
yesterday afternoon.

49:58.955 --> 50:01.080
Oh, my God. TJ,
that means that someone's here.

50:01.207 --> 50:02.665
Wait. Meg! Wait!

50:07.672 --> 50:08.713
What the..

50:09.590 --> 50:12.800
[dramatic music]

50:21.519 --> 50:25.062
I'm sorry.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.605
I'm sorry.
I saw the phone and I thought..

50:26.733 --> 50:29.942
I know, but, Meg

50:30.069 --> 50:32.236
that was a call that I got.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.362
The one that was supposed
to be Mr. Lawrence.

50:42.415 --> 50:42.455
What?

50:48.421 --> 50:51.005
Caller ID marks the exact time
I got the call

50:51.132 --> 50:52.173
from Jessica's dad.

50:52.300 --> 50:55.259
Or someone pretending
to be Jessica's dad.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.012
I don't know.
The connection was pretty bad.

50:58.139 --> 51:00.389
TJ, it was the killer.

51:00.516 --> 51:01.932
One by one,
killing off everyone

51:02.060 --> 51:02.558
who went to Mariner.

51:06.606 --> 51:08.856
Oh, my God.

51:08.983 --> 51:10.441
TJ, TJ, Nathan's the killer.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.446
He's the killer and he could
still be in the house.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.698
Alright.

51:17.825 --> 51:19.617
[dramatic music]

51:21.537 --> 51:22.536
[gasps]

51:32.548 --> 51:34.423
[sobbing]

51:37.804 --> 51:38.719
It's okay. It's okay.

51:38.846 --> 51:39.929
Look at me. Look at me.

51:40.056 --> 51:43.057
- Look at me.
- Something's very wrong.

51:43.184 --> 51:46.769
No, TJ,
you're the only one I trust.

51:50.191 --> 51:53.275
But we need to figure out
what's going on before..

51:53.402 --> 51:55.194
One of us is next.

51:56.739 --> 51:58.781
Let's go.

52:02.662 --> 52:04.620
That's weird.

52:04.747 --> 52:07.623
You see where this arrow is?

52:07.750 --> 52:10.292
TJ..

52:10.419 --> 52:12.628
...look, he was shot twice.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.630
And judging by that wound

52:14.757 --> 52:17.633
he was shot through
the back first.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.426
The killer was behind him,
right?

52:19.554 --> 52:21.637
He brained Kenny

52:21.764 --> 52:23.055
followed Nathan
into the bathroom

52:23.182 --> 52:24.348
shot him in the back.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.392
I mean, that first shot
must've killed him.

52:26.519 --> 52:27.685
Then he was hung here.

52:27.812 --> 52:30.604
Shot again with the same arrow
through the heart.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.523
[dramatic music]

52:42.368 --> 52:43.450
What's wrong?

52:43.578 --> 52:45.327
I know who the killer is.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.879
They were all murdered.

52:55.006 --> 52:57.298
I know, but by who?

52:57.425 --> 52:59.008
By whoever wrote these.

52:59.135 --> 53:00.426
- What is that?
- They're journal pages.

53:00.553 --> 53:03.137
I've been finding them
since we got here.

53:03.264 --> 53:05.472
Wait. You-you didn't tell me?

53:05.600 --> 53:08.017
I tried to tell you
what I was thinking, TJ. Okay?

53:08.144 --> 53:10.227
About Vivian and the rope.

53:10.354 --> 53:12.229
You tried to make me think
I was crazy.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.565
No, I tried to talk some sense
into you, alright?

53:14.692 --> 53:16.483
Intuition and proof are two
completely different things.

53:16.611 --> 53:17.568
This is all the proof we need.

53:20.698 --> 53:22.114
Lori hung herself.

53:22.241 --> 53:23.407
Exactly.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.701
A singer who made her
not want to sing anymore.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.328
Just like it said
in the journal.

53:27.455 --> 53:29.163
Her vocal chords
were crushed by the noose.

53:32.335 --> 53:33.959
Vivian slipped and fell,
alright?

53:34.086 --> 53:35.419
It was an accident.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.796
On a rope
that was clearly cut by a tool.

53:39.342 --> 53:40.799
Just like it said
in the journal.

53:44.639 --> 53:47.348
<i>(Claire)</i>
<i>My third school in two years.</i>

53:48.726 --> 53:51.894
<i>This time,</i>
<i>there isn't a fresh start.</i>

53:52.021 --> 53:55.481
<i>I know this time</i>

<i>How can I have a future</i>

53:58.861 --> 54:00.694
<i>That girl from sophomore year</i>
<i>followed me here.</i>

54:00.821 --> 54:04.406
<i>Two schools later,</i>
<i>I'm still wondering how she was</i>

54:04.533 --> 54:05.824
<i>dumb enough to think</i>
<i>that the electrical circuits</i>

54:05.952 --> 54:08.577
<i>on our partnered lab final exam</i>
<i>wouldn't backfire.</i>

54:08.704 --> 54:11.914
<i>I warned her.</i>
<i>She didn't listen.</i>

54:12.041 --> 54:13.624
<i>She blamed me.</i>

54:13.751 --> 54:15.709
<i>Now, that suck-up</i>
<i>got to retake the test.</i>

54:15.836 --> 54:17.461
<i>I failed. Shocking.</i>

54:19.048 --> 54:21.173
<i>That blond animal</i>
<i>scares me too.</i>

54:21.300 --> 54:23.384
<i>Is everyone following me?</i>

54:23.511 --> 54:24.760
<i>He's always yelling "Burn!"</i>

54:24.887 --> 54:27.846
<i>I hope his insides</i>
<i>burn one day.</i>

54:27.974 --> 54:29.598
<i>Doesn't either of them</i>
<i>have people to torture</i>

54:29.725 --> 54:32.476

54:32.603 --> 54:33.894
Blond boy?

54:35.606 --> 54:37.022
Ben.

54:37.149 --> 54:40.442
'His insides burned from his
allergic reaction to the nuts.'

54:44.865 --> 54:47.491
<i>(TJ)</i>
<i>Shot through the heart.</i>

54:47.618 --> 54:49.952
<i>Hit over the head.</i>
<i>Nathan and Kenny.</i>

54:54.250 --> 54:55.582
Whoever wrote this
is killing us off

54:55.710 --> 54:56.583
like she mentions
in the journal.

54:57.712 --> 55:00.754
Like a copycat.

55:00.881 --> 55:02.589
Yeah, but who wrote it?

55:02.717 --> 55:05.509
It could still be
a coincidence, Meg.

55:05.636 --> 55:06.593
Okay, you believe whatever
you want to believe.

55:06.721 --> 55:09.305
The weakest point
of a debate is one

55:09.432 --> 55:10.764
that can't tolerate
a discussion.

55:10.891 --> 55:12.599
Who should be the writer now?

55:14.812 --> 55:15.853
I'm serious.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.563
And I'm not crazy.

55:21.319 --> 55:22.651
- 'I'm not doing this now.'
- 'Okay.'

55:22.778 --> 55:24.194
(Gunner)
'We've done this too long.'

55:24.322 --> 55:26.947
The whole state and everything
has gone to ...

55:27.074 --> 55:27.740
I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

55:27.867 --> 55:29.033
So, I..

55:32.413 --> 55:32.494
Welcome home.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.083
Guessing you guys found these.

55:38.210 --> 55:39.668
[dramatic music]

55:39.795 --> 55:44.381
Like I said before,
no more working alibis.

55:44.508 --> 55:47.634
He's not a killer, Kumiko.
I've told you this.

55:47.762 --> 55:48.761
And you're my boyfriend.

55:48.888 --> 55:49.762
It doesn't mean I can prove

55:49.889 --> 55:52.181
that you didn't kill anyone.

55:52.308 --> 55:53.682
Nathan and Kenny
were both murdered.

55:56.354 --> 55:56.602
By?

55:59.398 --> 56:00.481
I don't know.

56:02.068 --> 56:02.900
[sighs]

56:07.323 --> 56:08.614
Been there since
we found the numbers.

56:08.741 --> 56:11.867
To be honest..

56:11.994 --> 56:13.911
...I was afraid
that they were for you guys.

56:14.038 --> 56:17.456
We didn't touch them.
Figured what's the point?

56:17.583 --> 56:18.582
And Minnie?

56:24.048 --> 56:26.340
<i>(Claire)</i>
<i>But there's one bright spot</i>

56:26.467 --> 56:29.635
<i>one shining beacon of hope</i>
<i>in a darkened world</i>

56:29.762 --> 56:31.220
<i>and he's special.</i>

56:31.347 --> 56:33.180
<i>I saw him look at me.</i>

56:33.307 --> 56:36.141
<i>I could tell he wanted to talk.</i>
<i>I can be so unapproachable.</i>

56:36.268 --> 56:37.768
<i>He's probably intimidated</i>

56:37.895 --> 56:39.645
<i>so I'll wait for him</i>
<i>in the copy room</i>

56:39.772 --> 56:42.481
<i>every fourth period.</i>

56:42.608 --> 56:44.650
<i>After we speak, he'll never</i>
<i>have to be alone again.</i>

56:44.777 --> 56:47.903
<i>Neither will I.</i>

56:48.030 --> 56:49.613
<i>But his friend is always around</i>

56:49.740 --> 56:51.949
<i>stalking him like everyone</i>
<i>is stalking me.</i>

56:52.076 --> 56:54.827
<i>He keeps asking him</i>
<i>about his date to the dance.</i>

56:54.954 --> 56:59.081
<i>Well, he's too polite,</i>
<i>but his friend's not.</i>

56:59.208 --> 57:01.083
<i>I heard what he said about me.</i>

57:01.210 --> 57:02.042
<i>I heard his friend laugh at me</i>

57:02.169 --> 57:04.378
<i>when he tried to shoot me down.</i>

57:04.505 --> 57:05.838
<i>But I know he wants to ask me.</i>

57:05.965 --> 57:07.840
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>a world worth living</i>

57:07.967 --> 57:11.051
<i>where we're not together.</i>

57:11.178 --> 57:14.555
<i>Tom doesn't know it,</i>
<i>but he and I belong together.</i>

57:18.018 --> 57:19.768
Does this mean anything
to anyone?

57:19.895 --> 57:22.688
(TJ)
'Yeah.'

57:22.815 --> 57:24.523
Yeah, it does to me.

57:27.194 --> 57:28.735
I know who wrote those pages.

57:31.866 --> 57:33.824
Claire Hicks.

57:34.994 --> 57:36.994
Wait. How do you know that?

57:37.121 --> 57:38.662
(TJ)
'I'm the guy in the copy room.'

57:38.789 --> 57:41.707
Thursday, after fourth period,
I went there.

57:41.834 --> 57:43.250
Every week.

57:43.377 --> 57:44.376
So, that was..

57:44.503 --> 57:45.711
Yeah. It was you and I

57:45.838 --> 57:47.379
in the copy room,
talking about homecoming.

57:47.506 --> 57:49.381
No. No, no, no.

57:49.508 --> 57:50.549
It couldn't be Claire Hicks

57:50.676 --> 57:51.758
because she can't
be here now, she's dead.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.680
(TJ)
'Hey, did you know her?'

57:59.977 --> 58:03.061
[sighs]
She was my lab partner

58:03.189 --> 58:05.355
before she transferred
out of Roosevelt.

58:06.692 --> 58:09.902
She made me fail
my electricity midterm.

58:10.029 --> 58:11.778
I had to retake it.

58:11.906 --> 58:12.821
(Meg)
'Don't you guys get it?'

58:14.867 --> 58:16.200
But what you said is

58:16.327 --> 58:17.993
whoever wrote those pages
had to be the killer.

58:18.120 --> 58:18.911
Yeah, but maybe she didn't die.

58:19.038 --> 58:21.538
There was a funeral.

58:21.665 --> 58:23.707
Did you go?
Did you see the body?

58:24.919 --> 58:27.503
I heard she committed suicide.

58:27.630 --> 58:28.921
I'm saying maybe
she faked her death.

58:29.048 --> 58:31.006
Or maybe she's dead

58:31.133 --> 58:32.299
and somebody else is
hunting us down.

58:32.426 --> 58:35.969
Guys, one problem.
I don't know Claire Hicks.

58:36.096 --> 58:37.513
I don't, and neither does Minnie

58:37.640 --> 58:39.306
so, why would she want us dead?

58:41.852 --> 58:43.810
TJ..

58:45.898 --> 58:47.105
...homecoming, man.

58:50.903 --> 58:53.862
That day, in the copy room

58:53.989 --> 58:57.157
I was telling Gunner
how I asked you

58:57.284 --> 58:58.659
to homecoming.

59:00.287 --> 59:01.495
(Minnie)
'I knew it.'

59:01.622 --> 59:03.413
[dramatic music]

59:21.100 --> 59:23.725
Minnie. Minnie.

59:26.355 --> 59:28.230
You've always
thought of yourself.

59:28.357 --> 59:30.357
That's-that's not true.

59:30.484 --> 59:32.568
I've given up so much for you.

59:32.695 --> 59:34.361
No, that's not true.

59:34.488 --> 59:35.862
You think you're the smart one

59:35.990 --> 59:37.155
and you think that I'm dumb.

59:37.283 --> 59:38.657
I never said that.

59:38.784 --> 59:40.158
You didn't have to.

59:40.286 --> 59:41.535
You wrote it.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.955
Minnie,
you didn't read my journal?

59:45.082 --> 59:46.373
The password wasn't hard
to figure out, Meg.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.792
So, you stole my laptop?

59:48.919 --> 59:50.210
You left it on my bed, okay?

59:50.337 --> 59:51.962
I'm not the thief here.

59:52.089 --> 59:55.257
- I've never stolen anything--
- You're right!

59:55.384 --> 59:57.759
What's worse is that you tried.

59:57.886 --> 59:59.177
Get off.

59:59.305 --> 01:00:01.847
She tried to take you
away from me, TJ.

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:03.890
I was never yours.

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:05.225
He never wanted you, Meg.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:08.520
'He must've felt sorry for you.'

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:12.190
You have to psych yourself up
just to talk to people.

01:00:12.318 --> 01:00:15.193
'Sing yourself songs
before you go to dances.'

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.737
You're pathetic.

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:17.154
That's enough, Minnie.

01:00:19.575 --> 01:00:21.366
TJ and I were meant to be.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:23.577
- 'You are crazy.'
- Don't call her that.

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:26.079
Are you serious?

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.873
You're the one
who chose her, TJ.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.958
Chose her? I asked you.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:31.710
I'm not talking
about what you asked me.

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:35.047
I'm talking about what you did.

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:36.381
What I did?

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:39.509
Minnie,
what did you tell her I did?

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:40.719
'You know nothing happened
between us.'

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:42.179
That's not true.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.431
I refused you, Minnie,
at homecoming, I told you no.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.350
You're lying!

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.393
Look at me. Is this why
you've been avoiding me?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.271
Been turning me down?
I swear, I didn't do it.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:55.359
Liar! You were there.

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:57.736
Okay? You know what happened.
Tell him.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.446
I don't remember anything.

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:04.159
We drank at the bonfire
and you told me that

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.577
you always knew that it was me.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.954
It never happened.

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:11.333
Look, Meg, it should've been you
with me at homecoming, right?

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.503
- But you turned me down.
- I had to!

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.589
Minnie is my best friend
and she's in love with you.

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:22.010
She didn't even think of me.
She cried that entire night.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:22.969
You weren't supposed to know.

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:25.347
What? That you're a bad friend?

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.307
That you're a liar?

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.352
All you've ever done
is keep me down.

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:32.896
Remind me to take my meds.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:36.441
What? Before he met you,
I didn't need meds, okay?

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:39.403
You did this to me.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.906
(TJ)
'Nothing happened
between us, Minnie.'

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.409
'Look at me, Meg,
you gotta believe me, okay?'

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.704
You gotta believe me.

01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:51.623
And you..
You don't know what love is.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:52.666
The only thing you
love is yourself.

01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:53.875
Now, calm your ass down!

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:56.628
This is calm,
Thomas Jefferson Fletcher.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.213
This is calm.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.423
(Gunner)
'Stop, guys!'

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.758
This is not
helping us right now.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.097
Before
"The Bold And The Beautiful"

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.142

from its commercial break

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:12.477
we have to figure out
if one of us is the killer

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.439
or if we're being haunted
by the specter of a girl

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:17.315
who committed suicide
four months ago.

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:21.403
You're right.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.655
Let's search the house.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.575
Can we all please stay
on the second floor together?

01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:28.410
I'll take
the hallway upstairs.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.456
Rollercoaster and I
will go search that room.

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.960
We'll search the bedroom.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.503
Come on.

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:41.840
[instrumental music]

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:56.688
Is she always like that?

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:59.149
You know, Gunner mentioned
to me before, when they dated

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:00.734
that she can be
a little unbalanced.

01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:02.986
She can't help herself, okay?

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.696
Must you always defend her?

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:07.073
You have to understand that
she never does that for you.

01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.742
What does it matter?

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.411
It matters when someone I care
about is treated like crap.

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:21.755
TJ, I need to know exactly
what happened at homecoming.

01:03:21.882 --> 01:03:23.173
Thought you didn't
want to know.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.050
Well, I'd say
the circumstances have changed.

01:03:25.177 --> 01:03:26.343
Wouldn't you?

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.762
[exhales]

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:32.557
It was.. I don't know, I guess
it really wasn't Minnie's fault.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:35.101
'What do you mean?'

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:37.145
[instrumental music]

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.022
<i>I was really upset about you.</i>

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.274
<i>I was drinking a lot.</i>
<i>We all were.</i>

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:45.612
<i>Claire just marched</i>
<i>in front of me</i>

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.031
<i>and yelled how she loved me.</i>

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:48.490
<i>That she thought</i>
<i>I loved her too.</i>

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:51.409
TJ..

01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:52.619
...I love you.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.746
I-I know you love me too

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.541
and that's why I'm going
to the dance with you.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.668
You don't have to take Meg.

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:02.420
<i>(TJ)</i>
<i>I was frozen. That's why Minnie</i>
<i>went to work on her.</i>

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:10.679
I feel so sorry for you.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:13.390
Not because,
not because you came here today

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:16.518
but because you are actually
under the illusion

01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:18.478
that anyone could see anything
besides the fact that

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:22.482
your...entire existence

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.776
is just one giant mistake.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:28.905
You're gonna die,
miserable and alone.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.409
No one will ever love you.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.287
[laughing]

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:36.496
No one will ever love you!

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:40.458
Where are you going, you coward?

01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:43.128
Why'd you come if you're just
gonna walk away?

01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:45.463
You came here. You must've
wanted something out of it.

01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:48.133
'Well, what'd you get?'

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.467
'Nothing,
because that is what you are.'

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:52.387
'You are nothing!'

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:53.930
'You must really
hate the person'

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.600
that you wake up and you have
to look at in the morning.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:59.644
No one here hates you.
You are insignificant.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:03.064
You don't matter to us.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:06.026
And to me,
that is a whole lot worse.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.155
You're nothing!

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:13.533
What? What..

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.534
<i>(TJ)</i>
<i>But I didn't do anything.</i>

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:18.204
<i>I was frozen, hurt, drunk.</i>

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:20.665
<i>She ran away</i>
<i>and was dead the next day.</i>

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.752
[sighs]

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:26.504
TJ, I didn't know
I meant that much to you.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:30.926
Yeah, well, you never asked me.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:37.223
Well, in that case

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:39.517
Claire was hurt by many.

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:40.560
And me too.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.771
But you turned me down.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.400
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
Claire didn't see it that way.

No. No. No.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:39.661
No.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:57.554
I'm leaving.
You'll all be staying.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.305
Kumiko.

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:00.765
That's exactly what they want.

Don't you get it?

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:06.312
There is no they.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.523
- One of you killed Gunner.
- You mean one of us?

01:07:10.402 --> 01:07:12.110
You're right.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:15.822
Except I know
that I didn't do it.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:18.867
You won't get away with it.

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.953
You're insane.
This is all insane.

01:07:23.123 --> 01:07:24.789
Don't follow me!

(Meg)
'Is she..'

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.165
Gunner was shot

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:09.209
just like he'd done
to Claire's chances

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:13.046
and Kumiko was electrocuted
just like in the lab midterm.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:15.048
What are you talking about?

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.804
<i>(Claire)</i>
<i>What Meg Pritchard</i>
<i>needed to understand</i>

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.013
<i>was that I went</i>
<i>to the bonfire to stake</i>

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.017
<i>my claim on him,</i>
<i>but she hid from me.</i>

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:27.852
<i>Sent her blond pitbull</i>
<i>to attack me.</i>

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:31.939
<i>Wanna know what it's like</i>
<i>to be alone and drowning?</i>

01:08:32.067 --> 01:08:34.901
<i>It's when you realize that</i>
<i>everyone, everywhere is nasty</i>

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:38.154
<i>horrible, and none of them</i>
<i>will give you a hand.</i>

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.657
<i>Instead, they will just</i>
<i>push you further</i>

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.243
<i>and further</i>
<i>down into the water.</i>

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.747
<i>He found me later</i>

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.667

<i>to be alone anymore.</i>

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:54.837
<i>Told me it wasn't</i>
<i>Meg or Minnie. It was me.</i>

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:57.881
<i>This is the end.</i>
<i>Now, they'll know.</i>

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.844
<i>I'll make them see</i>
<i>all those imperfect people</i>

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.886
<i>caught up</i>
<i>in their perfect lies.</i>

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.265
<i>They'll see what they failed</i>
<i>to notice before.</i>

01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:06.850
<i>They'll see me.</i>

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.852
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>I swear they will all pay.</i>

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.572
Are those keys to the boat?

'Meg, you just saved us.'

'You just saved us all.'

- 'Well..'
- Thomas Jefferson Fletcher.

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:32.667
Tom. That's his full name.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.795
No one's called me Tom
since I was six.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:39.924
Whoa.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.011
Minnie, get away from him.

Meg..

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:51.935
You lied to me.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.729
About homecoming.

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:55.940
- No, I didn't.
- You met Claire after.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.609
Claire-Claire Hicks?

01:09:57.736 --> 01:09:59.194
And you told her that
you were going to get revenge

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:00.445
on all of us, didn't you?

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.197

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:05.783
Alright. You need to tell her
what happened right now.

01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:07.952
I-I don't-I don't..

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:09.329
I don't remember.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:09.954
It's been you all along.

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:14.876
I have no connection
with Claire.

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.962
None.
You gotta tell her, Minnie.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:21.090
- 'Tell her the truth!'
- No. I don't remember!

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:22.967
- Alright. Okay, okay.
- Take my hand, okay?

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.261
- Take my hand, we're leaving.
- Meg, no.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.013
- Keep up.
- You, you have to listen to me.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.598
No. You have.. Back up.

He said that
you killed everybody.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:25.321
Meg, he said that
you were jealous of me.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.823
Not now, okay?

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.200
That's why you were pretending
to be my friend.

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:33.538
That's why you were
leaving me to go to LA.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:37.709
He said that you'd try
and kill me.

01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:40.169
Then he made me read
your diary on your computer.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:42.922
- And I saw.
- 'I know.'

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:43.840
You saw TJ and me.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.174
I should've told you, I'm sorry.

01:11:46.428 --> 01:11:49.095
I just didn't want to hurt you.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:50.555
I don't want to hurt you.

Yes.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.352
You shot him.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.358
Yes.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.783
This is all my fault.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:14.996
I never should have made
you guys come here.

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:16.581
I never should
have listened to--

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.374

TJ had us all fooled--

'to be alone and drowning.'

Well, not quite alone.

than I gave you credit for.

a couple of times.'

01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:04.962
to be upstairs with Minnie,
or in my room.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.130
Still, I won.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:09.926
[Meg screams]

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:11.344
[dramatic music]

01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:13.971
'You know, I was really
hoping for, like, uh'

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.932
'like a murder-suicide
type of thing, you know.'

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.226
Minnie offing you
and then killing herself

01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:20.144
but you can't win them all.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:24.023
(Meg)
So, you stole her meds?

01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:29.112
(Ben)
'I mean, I did that
over a week ago.'

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:30.822
I snuck into her house
and I replaced them.

01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:31.989
I mean,
the stealing of the bottle

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.783
from the luggage
was just for effect.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.869
I gotta say,
watching her downward spiral

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:39.705
into oblivion
was one of my favorite things

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.290
about this week, he-he.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:43.459
That, and you killing
your boyfriend back there..

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:44.669
God!

01:13:44.796 --> 01:13:45.211
God, it was epic.

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.213
It was epic.

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:49.132
Ah!

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:54.429
It brings me back
to my point though.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:57.056
I'm so glad you're number nine.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:58.516
(Meg)
'Why?'

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.309
Why us?

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:03.020
Well, ideally, in my fantasies..

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.983
...it was you and Minnie
as number eight and nine

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.818
you having figured out
what was going on

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.028
based on all the clues
that I left you.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:13.614
The journal?

01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:16.451
Yeah. Yeah, Claire's diary.

01:14:16.578 --> 01:14:18.369
So, you planted it
with my stuff?

01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:21.497
Then, you forged the last page,
so I would think..

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.292
You'd think the boyfriend
was the killer.

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.461
It's genius, right?

01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:29.464
- 'You're saying--'
- Yeah, and, uh..

01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:31.591
I mean,
it makes you more comfortable

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:32.758
to think so, doesn't it?

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:34.677
It's not true.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.804
I'm saner than all
of your dead friends

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:37.889
and I'm smarter than you.

01:14:38.016 --> 01:14:39.348
Well,
I figured out everyone here

01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.726
was connected to Claire Hicks.

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:43.603
'And that you were killing
us off in the same ways'

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.646
'you thought we wronged her.'

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:49.025
She thought,
thought you wronged her?

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.818
The nine of you killed her.

01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:52.612
You're all murderers.

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:53.738
Well, look who's talking.

01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:56.073
I am not a murderer.

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:57.492
I'm a, I'm a vigilante

01:14:57.619 --> 01:15:00.328
and I'm bringing justice
to all those

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:01.412
who wronged my sister.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:07.919
Sister?

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.254
Oh, my God.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:12.840
You're Tom.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:16.594
And you're Claire's brother.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.888
You know,
I bet that night at homecoming

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.432
you...and Minnie

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:22.767
and your
intellectually challenged dates

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:24.143
you barely registered
what you did to Claire

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.521
but you drove an arrow
through my sister's heart.

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:27.730
Well, killing us idiots

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:28.314
shouldn't have been
that hard then.

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:30.816
Not hard, no.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:33.986
It was brilliant.

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:35.404
<i>This was months of planning.</i>

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:37.573
<i>I started the day she jumped</i>

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.660
<i>because that was the day</i>
<i>she sent me her journal.</i>

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:42.870
<i>Do you have any idea the</i>
<i>details that went into this?</i>

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:44.455
<i>Preparing the house</i>

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.582
<i>luring you all here</i>
<i>and dealing with the Taylors</i>

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:47.500
<i>learning about the social</i>
<i>hierarchy at Mariner</i>

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:49.794
<i>so I could fit in.</i>

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:51.629
<i>Uh, pretending</i>
<i>to be Mr. Lawrence</i>

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:52.755
<i>inviting Jessica</i>
<i>and all her friends</i>

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.258
<i>to a different party</i>
<i>this weekend</i>

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:56.968
hacking into her
Facebook account..

01:15:57.512 --> 01:15:59.595
...killing that sap, Ben

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.264
and burning him
beyond recognition

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:03.474
and stuffing him in his locker
and taking his place.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.601
'You only missed
one thing, genius.'

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:08.312
I wasn't even there
homecoming night.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.358
Huh.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:15.152
Guilt by association, you know?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.737
See, the truth is

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:18.990
you're all
the originators of this.

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.493
'You started it.
You planned it.'

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.121
Everything that you
made Claire feel

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:26.831
I just enacted it upon you
in kind.

01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:32.169
I mean, you know, she was never
burned alive in a boat

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.380
but history was written
by the victor, huh?

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.757
[exhales deeply]

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.843
After all, Meg,
nobody likes a bully.

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.389
- Oh, my God.
- Get away from her!

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:45.474
[grunting]

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.655
- Guess you're alive, huh?
- Yeah, I played dead.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:02.074
I wanted to see who's
still alive in the house.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.659
Okay. Alright.
