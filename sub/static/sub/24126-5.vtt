WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.750 --> 00:28.208
we're so adventurous

00:28.208 --> 00:31.583
and again

00:31.583 --> 00:35.083
and there's nobody home

00:35.083 --> 00:38.500
to count on a friend

00:38.500 --> 00:42.083
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:44.000 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.958
I gotta be there

00:50.708 --> 00:54.958
Winnie the Pooh

01:18.750 --> 01:20.750
Christopher Robin:
See it? There's a whale.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.458
And that one looks like a...

01:28.458 --> 01:31.000
Pooh: It is,
if I'm not mistaken,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.416
a honey pot.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.291
Silly old bear.

01:35.291 --> 01:37.958
You think all the clouds
look like honey pots.

01:37.958 --> 01:39.458
Not that one.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.750
It looks like a bee.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.416
Christopher Robin,

01:47.416 --> 01:50.875
where exactly do all
these clouds come from?

01:50.875 --> 01:55.125
Well, they come from
a cloud machine, of course.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.625
Oh, yes.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.000
I should have known.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.458
The cloud machine
can make anything.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.583
See?
There's a pirate ship.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.000
And that one
looks like a dragon.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.291
Doesn't it, Pooh?

02:13.625 --> 02:15.958
The one carrying
the honey pot?

02:22.708 --> 02:24.958
It seems all this
cloud watching

02:24.958 --> 02:26.833
has made me rather hungry.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.583
Perhaps we should stop

02:28.583 --> 02:31.333
for a small smackerel
of something sweet.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.708
-

02:44.625 --> 02:46.166
Oh, bother.

02:56.375 --> 02:59.125
This, I think, is not honey.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.875
Indeed, it's nothing
in the least bit like honey.

03:01.875 --> 03:06.208
Oh, but as for what it is,
I don't know.

03:06.208 --> 03:08.250
Hiya, buddy bear!

03:08.250 --> 03:09.833
Hello, Tigger.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.500
Seen any good
muddy puddles lately?

03:11.500 --> 03:13.458
The kind that need
bouncing in?

03:15.583 --> 03:19.375
I'm afraid I've
only seen, uh, this.

03:19.375 --> 03:23.208
Say, where'd you get
that nice-looking
handful of blueness?

03:23.208 --> 03:24.500
Hmm?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.583
It came from up there,
somewhere,

03:26.583 --> 03:27.750
I should imagine,

03:27.750 --> 03:30.708
though I was hoping
for honey instead.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.250
Gasp!

03:32.250 --> 03:34.583
You knocked that down
from up there?

03:37.125 --> 03:39.375
Do you know what you done,
buddy bear?

03:39.375 --> 03:42.083
For one thing,
I haven't gotten any honey.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.625
You broke the sky

03:43.625 --> 03:44.875
with your stick!

03:44.875 --> 03:46.875
Ohh! I did?

03:46.875 --> 03:49.375
Do you know
what this means?

03:49.375 --> 03:51.958
Why, no, Tigger, I don't.

03:51.958 --> 03:53.291
Uh, do you?

03:53.291 --> 03:56.416
You remember
that crazy old story

03:56.416 --> 03:58.291
about the cat
who played out of tune?

03:58.291 --> 04:02.250
He fiddled so bad,
a moo-cow got mad

04:03.875 --> 04:06.833
Moo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:09.291 --> 04:10.875
Tigger: And k-nocked him
clear to the moon.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.708
Yaah!

04:15.583 --> 04:16.833
Pooh: Oh, my.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.833
Tigger:
The whole sky was bare

04:18.833 --> 04:20.458
when the kitty got there.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.583
And he fell

04:22.583 --> 04:24.708
to what looked like his doom.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.333
Meanwhile, down on the ground,

04:28.333 --> 04:29.583
all cuddly and round,

04:29.583 --> 04:32.583
Humphrey Dumphrey
sat on his wall.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.458
Then he heard a strange noise.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.958
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:35.958 --> 04:38.291
And he gazed up on high.

04:38.291 --> 04:41.750
And that kitty came falling
right out of the sky.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.458
He sent Humphrey flying
like a chubby old bird.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.500
But where the guy landed
I won't say a word.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.833
You won't?

04:55.708 --> 04:59.000
Aw, hoo hoo, you talked
me into it. Hoo!

04:59.000 --> 05:02.500
It was Jack Horner's pie
which was big as the sky.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.583
And when Humphrey hit it--
I don't want to quibble--

05:05.583 --> 05:09.833
the splash was so big,
it was-- -- horribibble

05:09.833 --> 05:11.958
What are we
standing here for?

05:13.208 --> 05:15.333
We got to warn everybody.

05:18.458 --> 05:22.416
Pooh! You--
You broke the sky?

05:22.416 --> 05:25.708
Oh, Pooh, how could you?

05:25.708 --> 05:30.208
Well, I was using this stick
to gather honey when--

05:36.708 --> 05:40.000
...when, uh, that happened.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.333
Uhh. Only a bear
of very little brain

05:43.333 --> 05:45.625
could break an entire sky.

05:45.625 --> 05:48.458
I'm sure Pooh didn't
mean to break it.

05:48.458 --> 05:51.708
Don't want to rain
on anybody's parade,

05:51.708 --> 05:55.583
but it seems to me,
with one piece gone,

05:55.583 --> 05:58.500
the rest of the sky
could fall, too.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.583
Why--
Why, Eeyore's right.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.583
Oh, dear.

06:09.583 --> 06:13.000
The whole sky is going
to fall down on our heads.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.625
The most important thing

06:32.625 --> 06:34.875
is to remain calm.

06:41.458 --> 06:44.958
Not surprised
the sky's coming down.

06:44.958 --> 06:49.083
Only surprised it didn't
happen yesterday.

06:49.083 --> 06:53.166
There. Quality construction.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.583
Meets all
the modern standards.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.458
Should hold up against
fallen skies.

07:03.458 --> 07:07.458
Of course, butterflies are
another matter altogether.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.125
I got to be ready
for that fallen sky

07:11.125 --> 07:12.875
because no sky
means no rain,

07:12.875 --> 07:16.250
and no rain means no muddy
puddles to splash in.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.708
That ought to hold me till
Tuesday. Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

07:21.958 --> 07:25.208
Oh, dear.
No sky means no sun.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.375
And no sun
means no light.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.458
And very small animals
who are afraid of the dark

07:30.458 --> 07:31.958
simply must be prepared.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.583
Oh, dear.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.125
If there was no sky,

07:40.125 --> 07:42.625
there will be nothing
for the bees to fly in,

07:42.625 --> 07:44.625
and that means
no honey for me.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.708
So I must gather
as much as possible.

07:47.708 --> 07:51.500
Ohh. Still not nearly enough.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.750
If the sky is going to fall,

07:54.750 --> 07:57.500
it's going to fall
all over my vegetables.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.708
I must protect them.

07:59.708 --> 08:03.000
With pieces of sky
dropping everywhere,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.500
nothing's going to be--

08:05.500 --> 08:07.291
safe.

08:07.291 --> 08:10.625
I don't know why I didn't
think of it sooner.

08:10.625 --> 08:15.708
It's simply too
dangerous up-- here!

08:20.875 --> 08:23.708
At least the falling sky
can't hurt us now.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.000
Ohh...

08:27.083 --> 08:28.208
dear.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.708
Hawmp!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.291
Bother.

08:35.291 --> 08:37.625
Down here we'll be perfectly,

08:37.625 --> 08:40.875
absolutely, 100% safe.

08:43.583 --> 08:45.250
Uh, more or less.

08:46.625 --> 08:51.083
Yes, sir, I've earned
myself some shuteye

08:51.083 --> 08:52.416
after all that tunneling.

08:52.416 --> 08:53.875
Morning, Tigger.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.375
Tigger? Piglet?

08:57.375 --> 09:00.375
Pooh? Eeyore?
Rabbit?

09:00.375 --> 09:03.875
Say, what's going on here?

09:03.875 --> 09:06.208
We're moving in with you.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.500
But-- But--

09:07.500 --> 09:10.125
Couldn't very well
stay where we were.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.875
Not with the sky falling
down on our noggins.

09:12.875 --> 09:13.875
Sky?

09:16.458 --> 09:17.875
Falling?

09:17.875 --> 09:19.750
So we thought we'd
come live with you.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.000
Forever.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.166
Forever?

09:23.166 --> 09:26.000
I can't have
houseguests forever!

09:26.000 --> 09:28.625
Mm. Hmm. No way no how

09:28.625 --> 09:32.875
can I have these squatters here
for the whole rest of time.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.875
Uh, there's only one
thing to do.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.333
If the sky's busted,

09:38.333 --> 09:39.958
I'll have to fix it.

09:39.958 --> 09:42.166
Hmm. It can't be done,
Gopher.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.000
It's impossibibble.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.125
Impossibibble?

09:46.125 --> 09:48.750
Why, I don't even know
the meaning of the word.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.458
Neither do I.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.583
If a thing's broken,

09:54.583 --> 09:57.833
I'm just the gopher
to unbreak it.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.000
Screwdriver.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.708
Ratchet.

10:00.708 --> 10:04.333
Yes, sir. Just about done.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.708
Not much more.
Almost there now.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.458
Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.333
Considered all the angles--

10:10.333 --> 10:12.875
patching, sewing,
new paint job.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.583
Figured there's only one
good way to fix it:

10:15.583 --> 10:17.583
going up and rebuilding it.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.583
No slapdash patchwork
for me, no, sir.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.000
Gopher, it will never work.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.708
Come along. We must finish
moving into the tunnel.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.291
Aren't you coming, Pooh?

10:29.291 --> 10:31.208
I believe, Piglet,

10:31.208 --> 10:33.625
since the broken sky
is my fault,

10:33.625 --> 10:36.000
- I should help Gopher.
-

10:36.000 --> 10:39.333
Well, the sun's gone out.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.708
First thing to happen
when a sky falls.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.583
Quickly, back to the tunnel.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.333
Come on, little Piglet,

10:46.333 --> 10:49.250
before some sky falls down
on your very small head.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.750
Yep, time's running out.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.125
Let's get cracking, Pooh Bear.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.208
Oh, my.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.708
On top of all the trouble

10:58.708 --> 11:01.250
I've caused
for everyone down there,

11:01.250 --> 11:04.375
I'm sure I've also made
things very difficult

11:04.375 --> 11:07.000
for Christopher Robin's
friends up here.

11:16.250 --> 11:20.291
Can't fix a thing
till I find out
where it's broke.

11:20.291 --> 11:24.583
Hmm. Mm. Got to be
around here somewhere.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.708
I don't see any sign of--

11:30.000 --> 11:32.708
Gopher? Oh, bother.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.583
And another bother.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.333
Yikes!

12:04.333 --> 12:06.333
W-W-What was that?

12:06.333 --> 12:09.000
Eeyore: Could have been
the sky falling.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.583
Not that I've ever
heard one fall before.

12:15.458 --> 12:19.250
Hmm. Looks like it's still up
there where it ought to be.

12:19.250 --> 12:23.458
So I was wrong.
Big surprise.

12:23.458 --> 12:24.750
Look!

12:24.750 --> 12:27.000
Piglet: Oh, it's
Pooh's honey pot.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.291
But where are Pooh
and Gopher?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.750
Hate to even bring up
the possibility,

12:32.750 --> 12:37.000
but they might be up there.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.875
That Pooh Bear always did
have his head in the clouds.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.166
Oh, dear.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.875
Never fear, Pigalet.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.166
We'll get him down,

12:46.166 --> 12:49.166
or my name isn't
T-I-double Guh-Er:

12:49.166 --> 12:50.208
Tigger.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.291
Which, by the way, it is.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.375
Oh, my.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.291
Gopher!

13:06.291 --> 13:09.333
Gopher!

13:09.333 --> 13:11.375
Gopher!

13:11.375 --> 13:13.458
Well, since he isn't here,

13:13.458 --> 13:16.583
he must be...somewhere else.

13:16.583 --> 13:17.958
So I shall look there.

13:17.958 --> 13:21.625
Oh, bother!

13:30.208 --> 13:32.958
No. He's not here, either.

13:32.958 --> 13:35.000
Good news, Pooh boy.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.250
While you were
sitting around,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.000
I found the trouble.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.708
When you busted the sky,

13:41.708 --> 13:43.833
it sprung a leak.

13:45.208 --> 13:48.375
Why, this must be
the cloud machine

13:48.375 --> 13:50.458
Christopher Robin
told me about.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.000
And there is where

13:53.000 --> 13:55.375
your cloud soup's coming from.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.875
Well, we're gonna have to
tighten that handle

13:57.875 --> 14:00.166
so the leak will stop.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.333
Yes. That's exactly
what we must do.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.208
Uh, can we do that?

14:06.208 --> 14:09.500
Mm. First thing
we're going to need

14:09.500 --> 14:12.458
is a larger-than-usual wrench.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.125
Tigger, watch your foot.

14:17.125 --> 14:21.208
Can you...reach it, Eeyore?

14:21.208 --> 14:24.208
Need to be a little higher--

14:24.208 --> 14:27.500
say, a mile or three.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.000
I don't think
this is going to--

14:31.458 --> 14:32.708
- Hawmp!

14:32.708 --> 14:34.291
...work.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.125
This ought to do it.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.291
Heave.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.416
Ho.

14:47.416 --> 14:49.458
Heave.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.333
Uh-oh.

14:51.333 --> 14:54.000
Unless we get
that thing stopped,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.583
the whole place is going
to be neck-deep in clouds.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.583
Gopher!

15:00.583 --> 15:02.583
I got you-- Aah!

15:04.875 --> 15:10.083
- Yaah!
- Bother!

15:14.583 --> 15:16.333
Almost had it.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.958
This time,
give it all you got.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.416
This won't do.

15:24.416 --> 15:28.125
We're just going to have
to think of something else.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.708
You're right, bunny boy,

15:32.708 --> 15:35.208
and I'm just the tigger
to think of it.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.458
Oh, Christopher Robin's
pirate ship is sinking,

15:51.458 --> 15:53.458
and it's all my fault.

15:53.458 --> 15:57.000
We got to get back
to the busted pipe

15:57.000 --> 15:59.333
so we can stop that leak.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.458
Yaah!

16:07.458 --> 16:09.750
Whoa!

16:12.416 --> 16:17.083
I came. I sawed. I hammered.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.000
Rabbit: This will
get us up there.

16:20.208 --> 16:23.000
But how do we get it
up there?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.875
Why, we'll simply--

16:24.875 --> 16:26.875
we'll just-- or we could--

16:26.875 --> 16:30.000
Well, this was your idea.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.708
Things are getting
so weighed down,

16:37.708 --> 16:40.416
looks like the whole
shebang's gonna go.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.875
Uh, Gopher, does it
seem to be getting

16:44.875 --> 16:47.166
just the least bit stormy?

16:47.166 --> 16:51.208
Yep. Sure sign
it's fixing to fall.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.416
Better get an idea
quick, Pooh boy.

16:53.416 --> 16:56.458
Dag nabbit! Why didn't I
think of it before?

16:56.458 --> 16:59.750
If you got too much of a
thing, you drain it off.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.875
That's the solution
to any plumbing problem.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.708
I think we'd better get
Pooh and Gopher down

17:06.708 --> 17:08.583
very, very soon.

17:09.708 --> 17:11.708
Rabbit: Heave.

17:11.708 --> 17:12.875
Ho!

17:12.875 --> 17:14.750
Heave!

17:14.750 --> 17:16.416
Ho!

17:16.416 --> 17:17.958
Oh, dear.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.416
My nose itches.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.583
I'll get it for you,
little Pigalet.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.708
Better not let go.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.708
How's that,
donkey boy?

17:25.708 --> 17:28.708
Said you better not
let go.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.125
Heave--

17:30.125 --> 17:33.458
ho-ho-ho-whoa!

17:36.083 --> 17:37.708
Well, back to
the ironing board.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.000
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

17:45.875 --> 17:48.958
Got to work fast.
Not much time left.

17:51.250 --> 17:54.125
Now to get the clouds
into the drain.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.875
Heave!

18:00.958 --> 18:04.083
Timber!

18:05.083 --> 18:06.958
By dinghy! Ha ha ha!

18:06.958 --> 18:09.166
It's working!

18:09.166 --> 18:11.625
Now to get
back to that leak.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.875
Oh, my!

18:16.875 --> 18:19.500
The sky's falling!

18:19.500 --> 18:21.375
Oh, dear!

18:22.375 --> 18:25.458
1, 2, 3.

18:25.458 --> 18:28.583
Success.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.291
Gopher, look.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.750
Christopher Robin's
cloud friends are safe.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.458
Wish I could say
the same for us.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.208
Fixing that leak
put us in a fix.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.458
Oh, bother.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.583
Head the high ground!

19:04.583 --> 19:06.875
If you can find any.

19:13.583 --> 19:16.000
Don't go anywhere, Pooh boy!

19:16.000 --> 19:18.375
Yes, I wasn't.

19:18.375 --> 19:19.833
Come on!

19:24.000 --> 19:27.458
uh, we seem to have run
out of places to run.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.375
Don't have much choice
in the matter.

19:31.625 --> 19:35.416
- Yaah!
- Ohh!

19:35.416 --> 19:37.250
Is it falling?

19:37.250 --> 19:39.250
Oh, my. It is!

19:39.250 --> 19:40.458
It's falling!

19:40.458 --> 19:44.208
Say, those piece
of falling sky

19:44.208 --> 19:45.750
look awful familiar.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.083
One of them bears a
remarkabibble resemblance

19:48.083 --> 19:49.416
to a bear I know.

19:49.416 --> 19:52.625
Other one looks
kind of like Gopher.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.250
It-- It is Pooh and Gopher!

19:55.250 --> 19:56.583
Quickly, the net!

19:57.708 --> 19:59.125
Over this-a-way!

19:59.125 --> 20:01.583
- No. Over here.
- Oh, dear.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.708
Pooh. Gopher.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.708
You're all right.

20:12.708 --> 20:16.125
Why, look. It's the sun.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.375
Gopher:
Pooh boy, we did it!

20:18.375 --> 20:20.458
We fixed the sky!

20:20.458 --> 20:22.875
You got it
looking good as new.

20:22.875 --> 20:26.000
Can't even tell it was busted.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.708
Oh, yes, it looks
very beautiful indeed.

20:29.708 --> 20:33.375
I believe an occasion
as wonderful as this

20:33.375 --> 20:34.750
calls for...

20:35.833 --> 20:37.875
a celebration

20:37.875 --> 20:42.833
in honor of Pooh and Gopher
who fixed the broken sky.

20:42.833 --> 20:43.833
Hip hip!

20:43.833 --> 20:45.708
Hooray.

20:45.708 --> 20:48.625
Thanks to their
heroic efforts,

20:48.625 --> 20:51.625
my vegetables will be safe.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.833
And it won't be dark forever.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.625
And I won't need a new house

20:56.625 --> 20:59.291
till it falls down again.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.833
And there will be
muddy puddles to spare.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.958
And the bees--
--

21:03.958 --> 21:05.875
can still make honey.

21:05.875 --> 21:09.458
And everybody can move
out of my tunnels.

21:09.458 --> 21:13.583
Because the sky
at long last is fixed.

21:18.833 --> 21:24.208
And we have nothing more
to worry about ever-- again?

21:24.208 --> 21:26.375
Why, bunny boy,

21:26.375 --> 21:29.166
do you realize
what you've done?

21:29.166 --> 21:30.583
Oh, my.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.833
And then the sky
was fixed.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.875
Here, you see,
are a few of the
pieces which broke.

21:38.875 --> 21:43.125
But, Pooh,
this isn't the sky.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.750
These are just eggshells.

21:44.750 --> 21:46.708
The sky isn't going to fall.

21:47.875 --> 21:50.708
Yes.
Not since we fixed it.

21:55.708 --> 21:58.750
Silly old bear.
