WEBVTT

00:13.680 --> 00:16.850
<i>You'd think with all we've lost,</i>
<i>that defeat would break us.</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:20.979
<i>But the only reason we're here</i>
<i>is we refused to die in the first place.</i>

00:22.605 --> 00:27.485
<i>We're as persistent as the cold,</i>
<i>forever trapped beneath the ice.</i>

00:28.486 --> 00:33.950
<i>We keep our eyes on the floor,</i>
<i>dig our nails in and prepare to brace.</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:40.373
Do you think I want to be here? Eh?

00:41.666 --> 00:44.753
That Mr. Wilford
wants me to be doing this?

00:48.131 --> 00:52.677
<i>Snowpiercer </i>is all that's left
of the world.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.595
- No, please!
- Mommy!

00:53.678 --> 00:58.266
Each of us has a personal
responsibility to the Engine Eternal.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.061
You Tailies barely have to do anything.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.732
Yeah. Just sit around and don't rebel!

01:06.524 --> 01:08.318
- This is your fault.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.614
Right, let's get it over with.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.532
Please don't! Please.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.869
Do it to me instead.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.664
Where's the logic in that?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.833
She's just a little girl.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.712
Yeah, a little girl
who helped to kill six men.

01:29.172 --> 01:34.761
I'm her mother. It's my fault.
I let her help the rebellion.

01:42.185 --> 01:48.775
Finally, someone with the moral fortitude
to take responsibility for their actions.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.110
All right.

01:52.362 --> 01:56.491
Baby! Come here, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:57.117 --> 02:02.789
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
You're so brave.

02:02.872 --> 02:06.876
It's gonna be okay.
Look at me. Look at me.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.213
Go to your brother.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.522
Be strong, Winnipeg.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.109
-I love you.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.585
- Unticketed passengers...

02:48.668 --> 02:51.421
...Mr. Wilford has found you
guilty of insurrection, murder

02:51.504 --> 02:53.590
and disturbing the order of the train.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.594
As stowaways, you have no right to trial
or the established appeals process.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.138
Layton, keep your promise. You hear me?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.140
It is only by
the largess and mercy

03:02.223 --> 03:04.976
of our Engine Eternal that you
have been allowed to live thus far.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.486
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.866
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.966
So, by the authority
of Wilford Industries,

03:37.050 --> 03:40.345
you are hereby sentenced
to indefinite suspension in the Drawers.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.849
May God have mercy on your spark.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.527
<i>They can take our limbs...</i>

03:57.612 --> 03:58.780
<i>our children...</i>

04:00.198 --> 04:01.199
<i>our leaders...</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:04.619
<i>They keep trying to take our dignity.</i>

04:05.703 --> 04:08.998
<i>But any survivor will tell you they</i>
<i>checked their dignity at death's door.</i>

04:10.416 --> 04:13.795
<i>The more they steal from us,</i>
<i>the more human we become.</i>

04:14.504 --> 04:17.131
<i>Humanity will fill our bellies one day.</i>

04:20.134 --> 04:25.848
<i>When we eat the rich of </i>Snowpiercer,
<i>1,001 cars long.</i>

04:50.873 --> 04:52.083
Easy, girl.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.321
We're facing
class-four track debris, Ben.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.905
That's why
I reconfigured the plow.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
- But I can't see conditions ahead.
- Good morning, Engineers.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.745
Good morning.
Our speed keeps triggering avalanches.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.330
Second one in an hour.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.624
This stretch gets rougher
every revolution.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.667
With a storm like this, Mel,

05:34.751 --> 05:37.253
it doesn't matter how many
old Russian satellites I hack.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.047
We're basically running blind right now.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.384
Keep the speed up.
I'm going to be busy downtrain today.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.095
It's gonna get hairy.
How's your murder in Third?

05:46.179 --> 05:50.308
It's two murders in Third,
an uprising in the Tail,

05:50.391 --> 05:53.644
and drama in First, where they're acting
like there's a mob at their door.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.273
Guys, back to the Engine, please.
Do not highball this terrain.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.609
I recommend we throttle back 12%.

05:59.692 --> 06:04.489
Javi, I can't announce blackouts.
Not today.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.659
Well, you can slow for safety,
or you can have electricity.

06:10.995 --> 06:11.996
Maintain speed.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.624
She'll hold the track.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.255
How long do you think
she can keep this up?

06:22.381 --> 06:25.510
Well, Javi, we're going on seven years
and counting.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.222
- <i>Attention, all passengers,</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:32.850
<i>Wilford Industries</i>
<i>wishes you good morning.</i>

06:34.185 --> 06:35.520
<i>-The temperature outside...</i>
- Get up.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.314
<i>-...is minus 119 degrees...</i>
-How you feeling this morning, Brakeman?

06:40.274 --> 06:41.275
Sit down.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.572
Don't get used to it.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.992
Yeah. She might be experiencing
some PTSD symptoms

06:50.076 --> 06:50.952
'cause I saved her life.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.330
You were in it to save your buddies.
I don't owe you a thing.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.708
You two are gonna have a great day.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.212
-Sanitation!
- All right, back it up!

07:01.295 --> 07:03.965
You know the drill. Sanitation detail.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.759
<i>Uptrain, you will keep your eyes down.</i>

07:07.718 --> 07:10.096
<i>You will not interact</i>
<i>with ticketed passengers.</i>

07:15.017 --> 07:17.520
- Watch it, Tailie.
-You could just ask nicely.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.813
Your people killed their friends.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.940
I don't think you realize
how unpopular you are.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.609
Yeah, well, they killed 14 of mine.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.454
Layton, come on.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.876
It was a good, clean arm.
It shattered very nicely.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.796
But, no, that's not enough
for the Folgers. They're with Sharma.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.383
She's worked up
a nice head of steam. I'll handle her.

07:47.967 --> 07:48.843
Oh! Wait a minute.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.430
-Oopsie!
-There you go.

07:53.431 --> 07:57.351
You're the First Class Committee chair.
Table it, or I will.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.606
How are everyone's train legs?
Did we miss our Gravol this morning?

08:01.689 --> 08:04.525
Actually, Melanie,
we don't think that Gravol

08:04.609 --> 08:07.278
is the best prescription
for a rebellion in the Tail.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.780
I think "rebellion" is overstating it.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.407
Commander Grey had it
contained in minutes.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.118
Six dead. Security forces
don't grow on trees, Melanie.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.578
And we have a second concern.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.787
The murder in Third.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.705
The one you tried to keep quiet

08:17.788 --> 08:19.999
because you pulled up a Tailie
to assist the investigation.

08:20.082 --> 08:23.169
Mr. Wilford picked
the best person for the job.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.712
He's a former homicide detective.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.255
There's a policeman in the Tail?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.592
There's a bit of everything back there.
Don't worry, Ms. Folger.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.053
The point is, upgrading this man
in the middle of a rebellion,

08:32.136 --> 08:33.137
it sends the wrong message.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.266
If Mr. Wilford needs help,
I was a lawyer for 25 years.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.270
I'd be happy to share insights
if you share details of the investigation.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.690
Well, as a lawyer, you understand
that information is privileged.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.777
And I didn't know that Finkelstein,
Branxom and Folger did murders, Mom.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.614
Go ahead and laugh.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.826
My family may not think
I'm capable, Melanie,

08:55.910 --> 08:58.871
but the Freeze taught us all
we have the capacity to kill.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.167
Which is why everyone is a suspect.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.835
Even you.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.422
Do you want more coffee, Lilah?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.216
Enjoy your breakfast,

09:10.299 --> 09:13.928
and it's a good day to stay seated
and ready to brace.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.805
Thank you.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.432
Good morning. How's your breakfast?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.309
Wonderful. Thank you.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.406
Tailie cop coming through!

09:34.532 --> 09:35.992
Rat eater, keep moving.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.084
You ready to detect, Detective?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.049
Tunnelman Jakes Carter.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.968
-Come on.
-He's the guy who found the body.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.636
I'm working a double.
This is my lunch break.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.140
Great. I'll join you.
Hey, small for me. He's good.

09:59.849 --> 10:04.478
I know you. You're that Tailie detective.
Look, I already told what happened once.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.314
I'm the train detective,

10:06.397 --> 10:09.942
and Mr. Wilford asked me
to come hear it from you directly.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.694
Do you have a problem with that?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.031
No.

10:15.906 --> 10:16.907
No problem.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.079
Look, I was doing routine maintenance
under Ag-Sec.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.458
Just another day.
Round and round we go, right?

10:25.541 --> 10:30.671
I pop a floor panel, there he is.
No arms, no legs and no dick.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.090
Who has access to the subtrain?

10:33.174 --> 10:35.259
Hundreds of people
go through every day.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.220
Workers, passengers, all classes.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.889
What are the checkpoints like
between classes?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.098
- There's--
-Don't answer that.

10:41.974 --> 10:46.145
I... I am trying to assess
how far you could move a body.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.901
All right.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.654
That's it?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.199
Nah, one more thing.
What's that you're eating?

10:58.282 --> 11:01.786
Mmm. This is the best beef noodles
on the train right here.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.998
Hey, if we need you again,
don't be an asshole.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.924
Okay. Stay on point.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.176
We got two hours till the autopsy,

11:17.259 --> 11:20.012
and Nikki Genêt is still unconscious,
restricted access.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.599
Well, when you're done with your beef,

11:23.682 --> 11:26.060
we'll take a trip to the Nightcar,
where she used to work.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.771
Scene of the first crime. Good.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.697
Is the issue with
the suspension formula or the duration?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.699
That's a complicated interplay.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.201
I've taken very good care of her. Her--

11:42.284 --> 11:44.370
I'm just trying to figure out
if she's gonna come out of it.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.330
Slowly, I hope.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.209
Maybe you should recommend Mr. Wilford
put the entire program on hold.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.544
No.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.465
Tell Mr. Wilford
I'll get to the bottom of it.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.550
Please.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.181
Then we better go look at your data.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.768
Night... Nightcar...
Night... Nightcar.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.439
Night... Nightcar.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.589

14:27.533 --> 14:31.203
I found Nikki in the room with Edward,
her regular.

14:31.912 --> 14:36.876
She had no idea what was happening.
Drugged, I was sure, by the real killer.

14:36.959 --> 14:41.088
But Mr. Wilford needed a quick resolution,
a body in a drawer.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.506
This time will be different.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.011
Just for context,
what was Melanie Cavill's role back then?

14:47.678 --> 14:51.807
That's a good question.
It's her lips to God's ear, isn't it?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.184
On the house.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.314
Old-world spirits.

14:59.189 --> 15:03.193
A little something special
for your service.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.404
What service is that?

15:05.487 --> 15:08.157
You could reverse a Wilford injustice.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.493
That hope is in short supply in Third.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.981
I've been wondering for a long time

15:41.065 --> 15:43.609
what exactly it is you do
up here in the Nightcar.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.987
We offer epiphanies, darling.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.075
Let him go see for himself.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.285
I can't let him out of my sight.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.663
If you want this
to be different than Nikki,

15:55.746 --> 15:57.748
he needs to understand what she did.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.383
You can have 20 minutes.
I'll be waiting right here.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.975
All right. What is it about this case you
couldn't tell me in front of a Brakeman?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.393
Patience, Mr. Layton.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.020
You wanted to know what we do here.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.147
You gonna give me the good stuff?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.693
The Nightcar's never actually
been a brothel, Andre.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.320
When the world ended,
most people needed something else.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.616
To grieve. To connect
with everything we've lost.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.744
I've developed the Nightcar experience
so we can heal,

16:35.828 --> 16:38.038
individually and collectively.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.748
You a therapist?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.961
Relax, Andre. Clear your mind.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.839
Remember how we used
to meditate in the Tail?

16:46.922 --> 16:49.049
Yeah, I gave that up when you left.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.509
You're in good hands.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.303
I'm sure we'll meet again soon.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.604
Close your eyes.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.917
Do you remember the water, Andre?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.673
I remember.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.260
Falling.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.305
Free-flowing.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.101
An element still awake.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.064
Hear the wind.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.735
The Earth is still alive.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.783
The birds. The leaves.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.205
Remember the trees.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.416
The grass.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.002
<i>The sun.</i>

18:09.880 --> 18:11.131
I can feel it.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.302
<i>Where are you?</i>

18:23.435 --> 18:24.645
I'm home.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.858
I see you.

18:32.736 --> 18:33.737
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

18:35.739 --> 18:38.200
-Yes?
-I'll need to see some identification.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.202
Oh, I...

18:41.245 --> 18:42.621
Whoa, whoa.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.206
No reason to be nervous.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.835
-Don't let the badge intimidate you.
-Oh, don't worry.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.130
It doesn't.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.552
<i>I missed you.</i>

18:57.386 --> 18:58.887
Where are you?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.430
I'm hungry.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.600
-I'm starving.
- I got you.

19:03.684 --> 19:07.479
-Ooh! Donuts!
-Mmm-hmm. Old-school. Weber's.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.857
Your favorite.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.733
-I love you, Andre.
-Mmm.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.404
What?

19:17.990 --> 19:18.991
Zarah Fahrami...

19:23.537 --> 19:27.416
You wanna do this thing?
Get married, you know? Make it real.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.128
-We are real.
-I know. Yes, but real-er. Say the words.

19:32.421 --> 19:37.259
Hold. Cherish. Sickness, health, all that.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.969
I'm not worried about us, Andre.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.930
I'm worried about the world.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.808
I got you, Zarah.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.896
-In good times and bad.
-I know, Andre.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.274
I do.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.245
I just wanted to hold you forever.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.091
To be clear,
this is not how it usually goes.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.726
What did you wanna tell me?

21:13.981 --> 21:16.483
Wilford's people aren't telling you
everything about Sean.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.152
I think he was a snitch.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.280
'Cause he was lucky, like he got perks.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.448
-What kind of perks?
-We won the baby lottery.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.159
That kinda luck usually means
you have a friend uptrain.

21:27.202 --> 21:30.747
I was gonna do it.
I was gonna have a baby with Sean.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.500
Did you love him?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.044
It's <i>Snowpiercer,</i> Andre.

21:37.963 --> 21:41.758
Look, I'm not gonna let them
pin this murder on you, Zarah,

21:41.842 --> 21:45.846
but while I'm up here,
I have a responsibility to the Tail.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.892
Would it be so terrible
if you stayed up here...

21:52.102 --> 21:53.061
with me?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.525
Time's up.

22:00.652 --> 22:01.486
Uh-huh.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.614
Not what my Nightcar trip looked like.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.409
Unfortunately.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.747
You were supposed to be
getting context on Nikki.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.624
That's called taking a mile.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.170
Sometimes detective work
requires a personal touch.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.883
Just to be clear,
I've never done an autopsy before.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.677
But I'm ex-navy medical corps,

22:25.761 --> 22:30.057
so I do know how to look for trauma
and diagnose PTSD.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.477
I guess we've all got all that now,
don't we?

22:33.560 --> 22:36.229
I formed out of Afghanistan
for a one-year gig

22:36.313 --> 22:38.565
on Wilford's Dreamliner as a medic.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.152
Who knew the world would freeze
and the job would last forever?

22:42.235 --> 22:44.237
This lividity here, that's pooled blood.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.990
It means he lay face down
for a while postmortem.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.075
They moved him later.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.952
What else did you see yesterday
and not share?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.246
You tell me.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.498
Okay.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.209
Multiple ligature marks?

22:57.292 --> 22:59.211
Yeah. Choked in and out.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.214
They wanted to drag out
chopping his dick off.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.508
Stumps look sawn off.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.010
Looks like this way. Down.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.512
Hacksaw, maybe?

23:08.595 --> 23:11.014
So the limbs were removed after.
He was face up.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.850
Um... Looks like with a...
with a different tool.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.436
Machete?

23:17.479 --> 23:18.396
Cleaver?

23:22.025 --> 23:23.443
You guys really don't go there?

23:25.278 --> 23:26.113
What?

23:26.696 --> 23:29.658
Okay. Who has the tools for this?

23:33.328 --> 23:35.330
Those noodles you had earlier,

23:35.413 --> 23:37.874
there were meat scraps in 'em.
From where?

23:37.958 --> 23:39.209
The butchers.

23:42.921 --> 23:47.217
-You're not saying this is cannibalism?
-No. We don't do that up here.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.302
We all know the rumors
about the Tail, but we--

23:49.386 --> 23:50.887
Oh, those aren't rumors.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.683
First couple of years,
there were kill cults.

23:56.726 --> 23:59.187
One gang in particular,
they would kill anyone.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.523
Eat anyone.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.234
Had no choice.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.279
The rest of us, we ambushed their leader.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.698
Each of us ate a piece of his heart,

24:10.866 --> 24:13.118
so that no one could say
they were innocent.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.875
Anyway, your lunch was good?

24:41.229 --> 24:42.230
Silva.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.908
- What do you want?
-Open up, please.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.576
We need to look in your freezer.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.120
-It's a restricted area.
-Brakemen's business.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.539
I don't give a shit.
It's a restricted area.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.708
If you want in, get the notary.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.044
Nice knife.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.421
Bet you could cut my leg off with that.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.174
We're butchering today.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.635
-Come back with the notary.
-Come on.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.431
...I assume it's due
to how long she was under.

25:16.514 --> 25:19.809
I agree, but pinpointing
the complex metrics of titration,

25:19.893 --> 25:22.020
duration, isolation is gonna take--

25:22.103 --> 25:24.314
-More research. Yeah.
-More subjects.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.650
That's the catch-22 if we want more data.

25:27.525 --> 25:31.780
This is bad. She may have suffered
permanent neurological damage.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.992
We can't justify
harming these people.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.705
No, but we have to make progress.
You know how important this program is.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.477
I've got a seismic alarm.
How bad is it?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.317
The whole slope
is coming down.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.988
Oh, shit!

26:55.071 --> 26:56.239
It's a class three.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.657
We're not gonna get through the debris.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.451
Hold on!

27:00.243 --> 27:01.786
-Brace!

27:01.870 --> 27:03.163
<i>Brace for impact.</i>

27:26.144 --> 27:28.396
We've got a breach! Ag-Sec! Cattle car!

27:28.480 --> 27:31.274
We have a breach. Ag-Sec. Cattle car.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.151
Javi, take over.

27:34.986 --> 27:35.820
Got it.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.957
- You okay?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.759
Keep moving back.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.328
Let us back in there.
We gotta search the freezer.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.205
-It's an Engineering emergency.
-Gotta search the freezer.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.748
-We're working for Mr. Wilford!
-Out of the way.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.959
-Jackboot!
-Breachman!

28:31.584 --> 28:33.086
All right, two minutes.

28:36.798 --> 28:37.841
Close the door.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.572
Check this out.

29:03.783 --> 29:04.784
I got it.

29:23.052 --> 29:26.014
-Hey, hey! Relax. Relax.
-Yeah, sure.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.350
Yeah...

29:33.938 --> 29:36.608
-Oh, God.
-Here's your beef.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.276
How about this one, huh?

30:20.360 --> 30:23.404
Seven years she work Hospitality
for Mr. Wilford,

30:23.488 --> 30:26.199
and now she comes downtrain
to be Engineer.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.701
Wilford asked her
to check it personally.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.578
Okay.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.791
Breachman Bojan Boscovic at his service.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.796
It's an extinction event.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.007
I'm sorry.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.134
Window job first.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.428
We need to know
if it's structurally sound.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.682
I've been given the okay
to reduce speed 10%.

30:50.765 --> 30:51.599
No, no.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.352
That is too fast for mountain work.
You give me 25.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.645
Battery banks.

30:55.728 --> 30:57.730
We don't have the terrain ahead
to make it up.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.108
I can probably get you 12.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.734
Mmm.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.112
No Jacuzzis in First.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.407
Okay.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.369
So we're on rolling blackouts,
starting with the Tail.

31:11.452 --> 31:14.289
What's 20 plus...

31:15.415 --> 31:18.084
-five, for our little ones in the group?
-Twenty-five.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.753
We gotta give
everyone a chance.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.338
You've got 26.

31:31.431 --> 31:34.392
Hurry up. They'll send more Jacks
with this blackout.

31:35.518 --> 31:36.561
Someone's coming!

31:38.354 --> 31:40.106
Hang on! Hang on.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.525
The medicine.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.361
But no painkillers, just Kronole.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.405
I'm... I'm not giving that crap to my mom.

31:48.656 --> 31:51.492
Okay. But it kills the pain...

31:53.202 --> 31:54.329
of everything.

32:15.683 --> 32:16.726
Patterson, how...

32:33.660 --> 32:38.122
Here you go. Open up. Open up. Good girl.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.084
Okay, Suzanne.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.712
There. That'll stop now.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.973
We can't ration any more power to Ag-Sec
unless we start canceling crops.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.265
We're not breaking rotation.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.810
Water won't flow
for a couple days at least.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.687
Not until the crack in the hull is sealed.

33:00.770 --> 33:04.023
Then we only have what's in the reservoir
for Third, Ag-Sec and Tail.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.452
We ration the people, not the crops.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.580
Third and Second will get
15 minutes of running water a day,

33:19.664 --> 33:22.542
and the Tail will have to survive
on what they've hoarded.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.295
Is this what the start
of a resource crash feels like?

33:26.379 --> 33:28.006
Starving the train from the Tail up?

33:28.089 --> 33:30.591
It's not just the beef.
It's manure for fertilizer.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.177
It's bovine cultures.
We use their methane.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.637
I know. It's bad.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.391
But how bad stays between us.

33:38.474 --> 33:41.853
In the meantime, we press ahead
with selecting the new apprentices,

33:41.936 --> 33:44.397
and we bolster faith in Wilford
to get them through.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.009
-Mmm.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.932
Despite your violence yesterday

34:20.850 --> 34:24.729
and the grave hand of fate
hanging over our heads this very second,

34:26.439 --> 34:29.567
Mr. Wilford believes
that children deserve an education

34:30.735 --> 34:33.237
in skilled or unskilled labor.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.909
And so, we are proceeding
with apprenticeship selection.

34:41.537 --> 34:43.831
The names are as follows.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.000
Mikala Mwanza.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.298
Mia Kai-Sheck.

34:57.303 --> 35:00.056
And the boy they call Miles and Miles.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.069
Should your families
choose to accept these invitations,

35:13.152 --> 35:18.157
you have one hour to get ready
for your new lives uptrain.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.547
Two legs and one arm.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.384
Uh... Left arm.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.844
-Can you hang up?
-What?

35:38.719 --> 35:40.263
No, all the butchers are dead, Roche.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.265
Hey, look, the butcher didn't kill Sean.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.934
-Think it through for a second.
-Okay.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.603
If you're gonna retail him for meat,
then why the torture?

35:47.687 --> 35:49.272
Okay. Uh...

35:50.398 --> 35:52.275
Whoever did it got off on castrating him.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.695
With the arms and legs,
it was the exact opposite.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.155
No emotion at all.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.531
So the butchers come second.

35:58.614 --> 36:01.159
Yeah, but he put arms and legs
in my frickin' noodles.

36:02.702 --> 36:03.828
Tailie.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.583
- Hey, easy!
-Back off, douche.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.212
Tail fucker.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.133
There is no use
getting us both shitkicked.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.134
What do you care?

36:18.217 --> 36:20.469
Just blame the butchers
and claim your Third Class cabin.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.556
First off, I don't want Third Class.
I want to go back to the Tail.

36:23.639 --> 36:24.682
And second...

36:27.852 --> 36:29.562
I guess I'm still a cop after all.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.531
I was assigned to the first murder, too.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.660
They had Nikki guilty out of the gate.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.747
Fast tribunal, took all of three hours.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.708
Nothing they could have done for her.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.797
You still care about
getting the right guy?

37:03.095 --> 37:05.765
Finally got into the freezer
and recovered your limbs.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.059
-Pretty good day.
-Thanks.

37:09.393 --> 37:13.356
She's good at this part, by the way.
Patting down the boys on the corner.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.525
Good night, Detective.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.992
Keep it moving.
Eyes down till you're back in the Tail.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.599
Come on.

39:14.810 --> 39:15.811
Eyes down!

39:18.898 --> 39:19.940
Keep moving.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.119
Come and get me, asshole!

39:32.203 --> 39:33.537
-Down! Get down!

39:35.331 --> 39:36.332
Stay down!

39:37.249 --> 39:39.043
- Hey, get up! Hey! Hey!
-Get off!

39:43.172 --> 39:44.423
Layton!

40:05.403 --> 40:06.904
Do you remember your mum, Miles?

40:09.615 --> 40:10.616
Uh...

40:11.826 --> 40:13.160
I remember...

40:16.914 --> 40:18.290
she smelled good.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.335
That's all?

40:22.878 --> 40:24.213
I only remember the train.

40:24.964 --> 40:25.923
You're my Tail mom.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.720
Miles and Miles.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.558
And Miles and Miles and Miles and Miles...

40:43.315 --> 40:45.359
You were so little when we started.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.779
Not anymore.

40:53.159 --> 40:58.164
Well, then, you'd better decide
for yourself, hadn't you?

41:02.501 --> 41:04.462
Layton says we need our people uptrain.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.300
He's right.

41:09.383 --> 41:12.052
We need every department.
We need friends high and low.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.220
See?

41:14.430 --> 41:15.723
You're a good listener.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.103
Miles,

41:23.856 --> 41:27.526
I swear to you,
I will not stop fighting from the back.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.447
But you're going uptrain.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.035
And that means
we might never see each other--

41:36.118 --> 41:37.536
Yes, we will.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.206
After the revolution. Like Layton said.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.208
All right?

41:48.756 --> 41:49.882
I love you.

42:30.130 --> 42:34.969
What do you see...
when you look at this train?

42:40.432 --> 42:42.643
I see a fortress to class.

42:44.687 --> 42:45.771
Is that all?

42:50.234 --> 42:52.528
Well, I see 3,000 souls surviving

42:53.654 --> 42:56.657
on a planet that's determined
to freeze all life in place.

42:57.491 --> 43:00.578
We're still in motion...
alive and kicking.

43:01.453 --> 43:06.125
And it's not thanks to chance
or fate or God.

43:06.208 --> 43:10.754
It is thanks to order,
meticulously maintained by Mr. Wilford.

43:10.838 --> 43:15.175
A balance of need and greed and speed.

43:15.259 --> 43:18.429
And you Tailies,
who seem to have forgotten

43:18.512 --> 43:23.601
that it is 117 degrees below zero
outside of this metal tube

43:23.684 --> 43:27.730
and Mr. Wilford is awake 21 hours a day
just to keep the goddamn heat on.

43:40.743 --> 43:43.829
Guess that's why he needs
informants like Sean Wise.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.793
Wise was a Wilford rat.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.173
He got paid in perks.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.552
Like the rigged baby lottery.

43:59.762 --> 44:03.432
Why else would you care so much
about a Thirdie's murder?

44:07.186 --> 44:10.856
So, what you really want to know is...

44:11.815 --> 44:13.400
when he was tortured,

44:13.984 --> 44:16.570
what Wilford secrets did he spill?

44:22.159 --> 44:28.874
Y'all got killers and cannibals
and God knows what else up here.

44:32.294 --> 44:36.131
So don't you lecture me about balance.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.638
My people found ours years ago.

44:47.726 --> 44:51.271
Okay. You're very perceptive.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.484
No wonder Mr. Wilford
wants you as train detective.

45:00.989 --> 45:03.409
But that's the only reason
you're still here now.
