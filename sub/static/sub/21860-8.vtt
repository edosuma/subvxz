Max!

00:21.021 --> 00:24.758
The dog is eating
your pussy blood again.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.394
Use the kitchen garbage!

00:27.628 --> 00:30.098
(sighs)

00:30.131 --> 00:31.932
* Mother

00:31.965 --> 00:35.369
* You had me

00:35.403 --> 00:38.106
* But I never had you

00:40.241 --> 00:42.042
*

00:44.278 --> 00:48.149
* I wanted you

00:49.817 --> 00:52.886
* You didn't want me.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.990

SAM:
Duke,

00:59.327 --> 01:02.596
let's close that
for a while, okay?

01:02.630 --> 01:05.032
Come on, honey,
let's do some homework.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.800
No.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.035
NEWSCASTER: It is almost
the weekend, and maybe

01:08.068 --> 01:09.137
you're looking for something

01:09.170 --> 01:10.138
to do this weekend.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.639
Let's check in with Trisha.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.607
Ooh, let's check in
with Asian reporter

01:13.641 --> 01:15.543
Tricia Takanawa.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.610
* She's gonna tell us all

01:16.644 --> 01:18.379
* About the rain.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.447
TRISHA:
...this weekend in Los Angeles.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.648
I mean, Cirque du Soleil

01:20.681 --> 01:21.882
is at the Santa Monica Pier.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.117
NEWSCASTER:
That'd be great.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.418
Dukey, you want to help
me with the layers?

01:24.452 --> 01:25.919
TRISHA:
If you like classical music...

01:25.953 --> 01:27.788
Hello.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.822
Hello...

01:29.923 --> 01:30.891
Hello...

01:30.924 --> 01:32.926
(beeps)

01:34.295 --> 01:36.730
Hey, the Internet stopped.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.400
NEWSCASTER: ...the London
Philharmonic, headed up

01:39.433 --> 01:42.102
by famed composer
and conductor Arnold Hall.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.404
Oh, my God, it's Grandpa.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.839
...to celebrate
the tenth anniversary

01:45.873 --> 01:47.575
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.942
(phone vibrating)
Mom, the Internet.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.211
What, honey?

01:52.180 --> 01:53.647
Hello?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.316
Hello, Sam.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.117
(quietly):
Arnold?

01:57.151 --> 01:59.287
Yes, it is.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.521
I'm coming to town.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.955
We are having the jubilee

02:01.989 --> 02:03.291
for Ludwig's Ninth,

02:03.324 --> 02:05.659
and the girls will be there

02:05.693 --> 02:10.498
to celebrate with me at the
second performance on Saturday.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.433
Yeah. You can do this?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.867
Um, Saturday?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.769
It's the 100th anniversary,

02:15.803 --> 02:19.273
and the girls will be there
to give me flowers.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.309
(applause, cheering)

02:31.519 --> 02:33.387
SAM:
You know, Arnold,

02:33.421 --> 02:35.022
the girls have lives.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.990
They have
plans and stuff and...

02:37.024 --> 02:38.526
they want to...
Mom.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.228
Mom, I don't... I can't
get any Internet.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.230
Oh, I don't know
how to do that, honey.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.031
You have to do
the reset button.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.033
(sighs)
Remember?

02:46.066 --> 02:48.802
Can you just put the iPad away
and do some homework now?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.037
I don't have any.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.406
Yes, I think you have homework.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.907
I'm taking-I'm taking iPad.
No, no, no!

02:53.941 --> 02:55.243
I love you.
No, Mom, no!

02:55.276 --> 02:57.211
(Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
playing)

03:17.365 --> 03:19.967
*

03:47.295 --> 03:48.796
(music stops)

03:48.829 --> 03:50.030
ARNOLD: Wait, wait, wait.
(cheering, applause)

03:50.063 --> 03:51.265
Please...
SAM:
Cool!

03:51.299 --> 03:52.800
(whooping, laughter)

03:52.833 --> 03:54.835
Who's there?

03:57.738 --> 03:58.906
Sam.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.308
Hi, Arnold.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.475
Hi, Grandpa!

04:01.509 --> 04:02.610
Hi, Grandpa Arnold.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.944
I wasn't expecting you.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.212
The performance is tomorrow.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.114
SAM:
Yeah, right, well,

04:07.147 --> 04:09.483
they can't come tomorrow,
so I thought I'd swing by today

04:09.517 --> 04:11.419
so they can spend
a little time with you.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.621
But I've told everybody...

04:13.654 --> 04:16.724
to expect them for the ceremony.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.293
Right, well, as I said,

04:19.327 --> 04:21.228
they have other commitments.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.229
Commitments?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.231
Yeah. Well, Frankie and I

04:24.264 --> 04:26.099
have her friend
Push's bar mitzvah,

04:26.133 --> 04:27.901
and Duke has stuff.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.803
Hey, that sounded
so good.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.572
You guys are really good.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.441
Good job! I always forget

04:33.474 --> 04:35.676
how much I like
this kind of music.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.247
Maybe you could take them
for a little lunch today?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.516
They would love
to spend some time with you.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.319
Where's Max?
Don't know.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.987
Did you ask her to be here?

04:47.020 --> 04:47.988
Yup.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.823
And she had a commitment?

04:49.857 --> 04:53.193
No, actually,
I think they're just dating.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.463
(laughs softly)

04:56.397 --> 04:57.831
You should have insisted,

04:57.865 --> 04:58.999
uh, that she be here.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.167
Arnold.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.702
She's 17.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.338
You needed to have
put time in on her long ago.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.206
I mean, she's grown up.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.775
These two, however,

05:07.808 --> 05:10.277
would love to have
a little lunch

05:10.310 --> 05:12.045
with their grandpa.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.381
(chuckles softly)

05:13.414 --> 05:15.182
Okay, my daisies.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.984
What about some ice cream?

05:17.017 --> 05:19.520
Sure.
Yeah.
Come, come.

05:19.553 --> 05:23.156
Take ten, everybody.

05:23.190 --> 05:26.727
Hey. Why don't you two
run off backstage,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.362
and I will meet you there?

05:28.396 --> 05:30.664
Give me just a minute
with your mother.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.701
Bye, sweetie. See you.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.307
You know, Arnold,
I'm-I'm not trying to cockblock

05:40.340 --> 05:43.677
your fantasies here; it's just
that they're growing up.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.513
I mean, they don't
even go to my events

05:45.546 --> 05:46.880
when I have something anymore.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.082
It's all right.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.350
I understood.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.021
So... what's up?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.523
(chuckles)

05:57.124 --> 06:00.093
I would like to talk
about Xander.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.395
Oh, really?

06:01.429 --> 06:02.830
I'd rather not.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.665
I mean, that's why
I divorced him.

06:04.698 --> 06:09.169
I understand, though, that,
uh, at the end of next year,

06:09.202 --> 06:13.206
your financial support
of him, uh, expires.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.108
Uh-huh.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.511
Which is why I thought
you and I

06:17.545 --> 06:19.346
ought to discuss it.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.081
Oh, boy.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.550
Ugh.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.785
(exhales):
Oof...

06:24.818 --> 06:27.020
This is really just...

06:27.054 --> 06:28.889
Oof...
Don't you think,

06:28.922 --> 06:31.024
for the good of the children,

06:31.058 --> 06:33.627
the father
should be provided for?

06:33.661 --> 06:36.029
He's not even in their lives;
he's a ghost.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.731
This is not my problem.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.400
I see. Well...

06:40.434 --> 06:42.636
Listen, Arnold,
I don't think

06:42.670 --> 06:44.705
this conversation's
gonna go anywhere good.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.441
I mean, what do you
want me to say here?

06:47.475 --> 06:50.277
I'm just worried about Xander.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.213
I've been taking care of your
son since the day I met him,

06:53.246 --> 06:56.216
which is Max's age
plus nine months ago.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.986
And I did it.
I did my time.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.153
I paid.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.590
I paid what I was told to pay.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.126
And if you think, now,
that I'm gonna volunteer

07:06.159 --> 07:09.429
to help this guy, who takes
no part in his children's care,

07:09.463 --> 07:11.164
you're high.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.333
Why don't you
take care of him?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.769
(chuckling):
Oh, well...

07:15.803 --> 07:17.237
Seriously.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.440
Write him a check;
you're doing fine.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.242
But money's money.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.277
Yes, and I'm keeping mine.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.179
You should give him yours.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.582
When he turned 18, I told him,

07:28.616 --> 07:30.684
as my father told me,

07:30.718 --> 07:34.154
a boy of leisure has two ways
to provide for himself

07:34.187 --> 07:36.189
when the strings are cut:

07:36.223 --> 07:37.925
find a skill...

07:37.958 --> 07:41.228
or find a woman
who can provide.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.264
He chose the latter.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, but that's
why we're divorced now.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.136
Why am I having
this conversation?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.971
Is this really happening?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.673
This is like a bad dream.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.674
Sam...

07:53.707 --> 07:55.275
(exhales)

07:55.308 --> 07:58.278
He can't take care
of himself.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.015
I sometimes think,
uh, the boy might do...

08:02.049 --> 08:03.884
himself in.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.218
(whispers):
Yes.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.388
Yes! Yes, please!

08:11.091 --> 08:12.726
Okay, then.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.730
At least I tell
to his mother

08:16.764 --> 08:19.099
that I tried.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.339
Thank you for bringing my girls.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.344
(sighs)
And, uh...

08:31.378 --> 08:33.947
Sam, uh...

08:35.015 --> 08:36.684
(chuckles softly)

08:41.889 --> 08:43.423
(Sam sighs heavily)

08:45.593 --> 08:47.728
(groans):
Oh...

08:47.761 --> 08:49.630
boy.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.569
This place is so cool.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.206
It's really cool.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
(groans, exhales)

09:02.576 --> 09:04.444
SAM:
Oh, I got a good one.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.379
My ex-husband's father...

09:06.413 --> 09:07.781
We divorced in whatever.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.683
Anyway, I've been
paying him support

09:09.717 --> 09:11.719
while I take care
of the kids.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.854
Oh, I know this
story, believe me.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.756
It's like the same
for everybody.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.859
And I get to stop
paying him next year,

09:18.892 --> 09:22.062
and his father just
asked me to keep paying

09:22.095 --> 09:23.931
because, oh, poor him.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.899
You know what
the worst part is?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.067
You're gonna do it.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.568
You're gonna
take care of him

09:28.602 --> 09:30.070
for the rest of his life.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.539
No, I'm not.
My ex-husband,

09:32.572 --> 09:33.907
I took care of him.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.909
Then, when the kids moved out,

09:35.943 --> 09:37.645
he started sniffin' around.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.546
He lives in
my basement.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.314
I would never do that.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.415
You're gonna.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.251
I said exactly the same thing.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.819
You're gonna do it.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.455
You're gonna do it.
I don't have a basement.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.890
Do you have a garage?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.324
Yes.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.227
But I don't think
he could live in there.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.464
You should see
my basement.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.743
(groans)

10:09.777 --> 10:11.544
Nope.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.615
This is not only

10:15.649 --> 10:18.285
a celebration of Push

10:18.318 --> 10:19.586
and his manhood...

10:19.619 --> 10:21.088
FRANKIE: Sam?
(both chuckle)

10:21.121 --> 10:24.792
(whispering): Listen,
I'm really concerned.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.994
Look, you're going
to have to face this.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.328
It's reality.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.430
Your career could end
any minute.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.932
I mean, think about it.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.434
Actresses have a shelf life,

10:34.467 --> 10:38.105
and I got to hand it to you,
it is astonishing

10:38.138 --> 10:40.173
how long you've been
able to stretch it out.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.609
You're working well beyond
your expiration date, Sam.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.544
I mean, what are
you, fifty...

10:44.577 --> 10:46.546
seven, fifty-eight?

10:46.579 --> 10:49.282
You have to start thinking
about your future.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.518
You need an exit strategy.
There's no way

10:51.551 --> 10:54.354
Hollywood is gonna keep you
around for much longer.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.656
And the end is not
going to come easy.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.959
Just... one day
you're gonna go to work,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.894
and work won't be there.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.630
Then what happens to me
and my sisters?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.800
(sighs)

11:06.834 --> 11:09.202
You're gonna have to start
wearing a yarmulke, Sam.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.204
Because I don't know
if you realize this,

11:11.238 --> 11:12.840
but your hair
is falling out.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.407
Seriously,
you're developing a bald spot.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.043
I'm saying this
because I love you.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.878
Everyone is talking
about it.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.580
When was the last time
you saw the back of your head?

11:20.613 --> 11:22.415
(clears throat)

11:22.449 --> 11:24.417
Mom, look at Mr. Cohen.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.186
Mom, that's you in...

11:26.219 --> 11:27.888
two years, maybe one.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.057
Mom, I love you--
no offense,

11:30.090 --> 11:33.226
but you have a massive bald spot
on the back of your head.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.862
Hi, Sam. How are you?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.263
(awkward chuckle):
Oh, hi, Dayle.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.731
Oh, you look so beautiful.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.867
Oh, thank you. Oh, my God,
Frankie got so big.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.534
Hi, Mrs. Lunchen.
Hi.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.703
RABBI: Now, all kidding aside
there, I want to talk

11:43.737 --> 11:46.039
about this ancient tradition--
the bar mitzvah.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.776
Now, you know,
when I was growing up,

11:48.809 --> 11:50.677
girls didn't have bat mitzvahs.
(clears throat)

11:50.710 --> 11:53.213
Listen, I have some ideas
for jobs you can maybe look for

11:53.246 --> 11:55.082
when your career
ends horribly.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.284
Like you could work at
McDonald's as a vomit cleaner.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.920
Or, or... you know those places
where they take everybody's shit

11:59.953 --> 12:01.789
in the whole city
and they chemically separate it

12:01.822 --> 12:04.624
into fertilizer and drinking
water? Yeah.
Hmm. Hmm.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.626
You could work at one of those.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.262
You could be a shit-sorter.
That would be

12:09.296 --> 12:12.399
a great job
for an old bald lady.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.137
RABBI: And now,
Push's parents have asked
(sighs)

12:17.170 --> 12:19.706
a very close family friend
to say a few words.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.809
So I would like to invite

12:21.842 --> 12:25.913
Sam Fox to come
to the stage. Sam?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.723
Lady Rabbi!

12:36.756 --> 12:39.292
Ah.
Okay. High five.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.828
Push!

12:40.861 --> 12:42.729
What a night, what
an incredible night.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.433
What a night for you--
you're a man now.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.135
You're a man.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.938
Well, except your penis part--
that's probably...

12:50.971 --> 12:53.740
(laughter)
still a boy.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.143
The rabbi knows,
'cause she was there

12:56.176 --> 12:59.446
when the mohel cut it
in half. Snip, snip.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.680
Wait a second.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.182
So was I.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.117
I had the fish.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.486
At least I hope it was the fish.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.155
(laughter)

13:08.188 --> 13:09.990
But, anyway,

13:10.023 --> 13:12.459
you are totally a man now, Push,

13:12.492 --> 13:13.927
in every other sense.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.096
Even though
you live with your mom

13:16.129 --> 13:18.698
and you probably will
until you're about 23,

13:18.731 --> 13:21.168
and then she'll hand you over
to some poor woman

13:21.201 --> 13:24.204
who will raise
your kids for you

13:24.237 --> 13:26.706
while you watch sports.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.176
And the mother.
Sunny,

13:29.209 --> 13:32.212
do you remember when
Frankie and Push

13:32.245 --> 13:35.382
were in kindergarten,
and we used to cry and cry

13:35.415 --> 13:37.150
'cause we were so tired?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.685
(sniffles)

13:38.718 --> 13:40.387
(voice breaking):
And they're 13 now?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.422
And it's easier, right?

13:43.423 --> 13:44.824
No?

13:44.858 --> 13:46.793
(sniffles)
But, seriously,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.029
Push, you did a great job today,

13:49.062 --> 13:51.164
reading in Hebrew
and Jewing it up

13:51.198 --> 13:53.700
so good.
And your grandmas.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.703
You still have
two whole living

13:56.736 --> 13:59.306
bubbies!
Treasure that.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.541
Look at them--
all the nachas

14:01.574 --> 14:04.377
they're feeling,
right? Bertie?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.679
Barb? And somehow,

14:06.713 --> 14:10.317
your father looks older
than both of them.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.519
(laughter)

14:12.552 --> 14:15.255
(sniffles)
But seriously,

14:15.288 --> 14:19.259
I look out at all of you,
and what I see is love.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.028
As silly as these things are,

14:21.061 --> 14:24.064
we come together

14:24.097 --> 14:25.665
in love.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.500
And so, I want
to thank you, Push,

14:27.534 --> 14:29.702
for bringing us
all together...

14:29.736 --> 14:31.104
in love.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.073
And to your family,

14:33.106 --> 14:35.842
I wish you
the very best of lives

14:35.875 --> 14:37.911
and the very best year.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.514
Good night!
Thank you, Detroit!

14:41.548 --> 14:44.084
(Sunny whoops, applause)

14:44.117 --> 14:47.220
(speaking Hebrew)

14:47.254 --> 14:48.721
(laughing):
Oh, my God, I'm dying.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.390
I love you so much.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.293
Oh, dude, I love you.
Was it okay?
You killed me.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.262
Are you kidding me?
It was amazing.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.965
I will never forget it
as long as I live.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.766
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.234
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.903
Hi, Bertie!
How are you feeling?

15:03.937 --> 15:07.207
Today was my grandson's
bar mitzvah.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.608
Yes. Yes, I know.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.944
Push. He's 13!

15:10.978 --> 15:12.812
Yes! Yes, he is!

15:12.845 --> 15:14.214
Thank you.
Thank you.
(laughs)

15:14.247 --> 15:16.049
Oh, I got to go to the can.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.450
(Sam laughs)

15:17.484 --> 15:20.787
You remember
my sister Felicia.
Hi.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.123
I think it's really
inappropriate what you said.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.724
Well, I'm sorry...

15:24.757 --> 15:26.893
Felicia, shut the fuck up.
Get away from her.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.228
There are children
here, Sunny.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.997
Get away... now.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.931
Ooh!
Go.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.434
Ooh! I'm sorry
I made a trouble.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.969
No. Screw her.
She never changes.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.737
I'm the one who
should be sorry.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.639
Ooh!
I had to invite her,
'cause of the bar mitzvah

15:39.672 --> 15:41.441
and the freaking
family and...
That was intense.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.842
Ah... we need drinks.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.311
Yeah.
We need drinks.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.745
Sunny, congratulations!
Oh, thank you, Dayle.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.614
Are you going to go...?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.282
Are you going to go
to St. Barts in April?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.683
(clears throat)

15:50.717 --> 15:51.985
Oh, hi, Frankie.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.520
Hi!
(gasps)

15:53.553 --> 15:55.922
Oh, my goodness gracious.
What happened to you there?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.357
Oh, nothing.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.791
The dress came that way.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.460
Did it?
Yeah, it's fine.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.129
That's good.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.165
It's weird, though,
because it kind of looks like

16:05.198 --> 16:08.168
you had bloody diarrhea
out of your belly button.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.837
Oh, no, it's fine.
Good. Glad to hear it.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.806
Well, I got to
get back to it.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.942
Back to what?
Oh, you know.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.111
Me and the other girls
are giving presents

16:18.145 --> 16:20.013
to the Bar Mitzvah boy
in the stairwell.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.714
You're giving him
another present?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.483
We're giving him money,
honey.
No.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.952
Mom, I'm giving
him a present.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.720
All the girls are.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.223
Oh. Is that right?
Yeah.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.791
I already went.
I'm going again.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
Good for you.
Hmm, good for him.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.662
Well, sure.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.497
Hey, Mom, when
you were my age,

16:37.530 --> 16:40.967
did you ever give boys
presents at their bar mitzvah?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.070
Oh, my God.
I was kidding.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.637
(muffled groan)
But you did.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.540
Oh, my God, Mom,
you were such a whore. Gross!

16:47.574 --> 16:50.077
Oh, Drew.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.578
Oh, hi.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.346
Oh.
Oh, yeah,
that's nothing. It's fine.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.814
DREW:
Y-You're not coming
to class anymore.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.249
What's up?
FRANKIE:
Oh, yeah.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.017
I switched
Spanish classes.
DREW: Huh.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.819
FRANKIE:
Did they not
tell him that?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.189
DREW:
No. It seems like you
were just avoiding me.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.524
Oh, yeah, definitely
would never do that.

17:04.557 --> 17:08.095
This is why I... told them
they should have fired him

17:08.128 --> 17:11.064
a long time ago.
Yeah? I don't know, man.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.533
So, I feel like I never
see you anymore. What's up?

17:13.566 --> 17:15.568
Oh, yeah.
You know, just...

17:15.602 --> 17:17.170
Stuff?
Yeah.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.806
We should hang
out soon.
Definitely, yeah.

with the cans?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.432
Sure.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.900
Thank you.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.060
Do you want me
to get the last one?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.562
No, I got it.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.563
Okay.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.399
Here. Take the keys.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.000
Okay.
