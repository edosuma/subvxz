01:26.461 --> 01:30.006
Ms. Jefferson, your presence
has been requested

01:30.090 --> 01:31.883
in the attorney visitation room.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.803
Come on, let's go.

01:34.886 --> 01:38.431
<i>♪ I wish somebody ♪</i>

02:12.298 --> 02:15.468
Yo, Professor T. Today's the big GED day.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.096
Check this out. My power pose.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.306
Gonna make me feel confident
even if I'm not feeling it.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.100
It works on a deeper level.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.311
Okay, let's keep it moving.
Can't.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.981
Read you gotta hold the pose for
two minutes for the confidence to sink in.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.484
You should try too, for something
you wanna feel more brave on.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.320
<i>♪ Oh, yes, I do ♪</i>

02:56.926 --> 02:58.636
I apologize. Um...

02:59.554 --> 03:02.140
I am scheduled for a hearing in Albany
this afternoon,

03:02.223 --> 03:03.975
so I'm a little bit scattered.

03:05.101 --> 03:08.229
I'm truly sorry that it's taken this long
to sit down with you,

03:08.313 --> 03:12.734
but we wanted to make sure that we were
being as thorough as possible.

03:12.817 --> 03:16.070
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's the first steps, right?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.573
I read in the law library

03:18.656 --> 03:22.160
that <i>habeas</i> petitions
usually take a while, so...

03:26.247 --> 03:30.001
I reviewed your friend's notebook,
and to be 100% honest...

03:30.919 --> 03:33.087
I don't think
it meets the evidentiary burden

03:33.171 --> 03:34.339
for a <i>habeas</i> proceeding.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.053
You're welcome to file one <i>pro se,</i>
but our organization--

03:40.136 --> 03:43.431
Nah, that ain't possible.
Did you read it?

03:43.514 --> 03:46.017
I read it, Tasha. It's not enough.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.685
Okay, then read it again.

03:50.021 --> 03:54.776
Look, I know
Suzanne ain't the best witness,

03:55.485 --> 03:57.946
but one thing about her, she don't lie.

03:59.030 --> 04:03.201
Those CERT officers are the ones
who killed Piscatella, not me.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.370
You have to believe me.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.747
I do believe you, but that's not enough.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.584
Suzanne was having a psychotic episode
when she gave her original statement.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.254
-She's not a credible witness.
-Okay, um...

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
Then what about Cindy Hayes?

04:16.422 --> 04:20.593
We can maybe get her to retract
if we show her the book?

04:20.677 --> 04:21.678
We can't locate her.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.347
We reached out to her family,
and they've lost contact.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.724
There's no evidence, Tasha.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.353
We've spent an enormous amount
of our resources scouring,

04:30.436 --> 04:32.814
but there's nothing. I'm sorry.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.361
"Sorry"?

04:41.739 --> 04:43.324
You know I'm innocent.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.786
And you know...

04:49.580 --> 04:52.041
I'mma spend the rest of my life in here,

04:53.751 --> 04:57.255
and all you got for me is "I'm sorry"?

04:57.922 --> 05:02.385
Man, if that's all you got,
get the fuck out of my face.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.482
I'll come by and check on you
once you've calmed down.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.443
Nah.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.363
I ain't never seeing you again.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.785
Don't give up.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.666
-Ah, come on, Tuck, you know this. The--

05:33.750 --> 05:40.673
-Listen. The Declaration of Independence.
Fuck. I knew it.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.010
Fuck me.
Can't believe this test is in an hour.

05:44.093 --> 05:48.181
I'm so gonna fail this. Thanks,
Travis Kimball, you were right.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.932
Who's Travis Kimball?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.976
He was this fucking guy in tenth grade

05:52.060 --> 05:55.229
that always said,
"You're dumb as a Dog-gett."

05:55.313 --> 05:58.483
You're not dumb.
You just got a special brain, like me.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.944
I know that this might be
hard for you to believe,

06:02.028 --> 06:05.823
but when I was in school,
people used to call me names, too.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.242
-Yeah. I know.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.913
But Mommy said I can't listen
to the people

06:11.996 --> 06:13.915
who know the least about me.

06:13.998 --> 06:17.710
I gotta listen to the people
who know me the most.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.672
-Yeah.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.424
Better than anyone in this prison?

06:25.093 --> 06:28.137
Yeah, and better
than the whole world, maybe?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.222
Yeah.

06:29.305 --> 06:33.643
Then, as the world
Tiffany Doggett expert...

06:33.726 --> 06:38.439
-Mmm.
-...I say, Travis Kimball doesn't know

06:38.523 --> 06:42.902
what the fucking fuck he is talking about.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.281
Yeah. Fucking married his aunt.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.410
I think you're smart.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.204
And I think you're gonna pass this test.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.459
When I had a big test, Mommy would say

06:58.543 --> 07:02.797
I could have all the pineapple juice
that I wanted after.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.509
Why? Pineapple juice tastes like farts.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.011
Disagree.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.931
What was the reward you liked
when you were a kid?

07:12.014 --> 07:15.726
If I was really calm, and I was quiet,
and my mom had a man friend over,

07:15.810 --> 07:17.228
I would get breakfast for dinner.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.397
-Mmm-hmm.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.816
It's done.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.026
-How are we gonna get--
-No.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.238
It's done.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.449
Now...

07:30.032 --> 07:33.953
"Where was..."
Shit.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.540
"...the first of the 13 colonies located?"

07:37.623 --> 07:41.919
Um, Virginia. Because America was a virgin
before the British entered.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.591
-And the crowd goes wild!

07:54.432 --> 07:56.392
Here she comes. Let me do the talking.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.643
-Good morning, Warden.
Mmm-hmm.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.021
You look very interesting today.

08:00.104 --> 08:03.232
Those are very interesting clothes
that you're wearing.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.320
You have one minute to say whatever
you're stalling to say. Talk fast.

08:07.403 --> 08:11.574
We were hoping for clarification
as to whether it's standard protocol

08:11.657 --> 08:14.285
to search or not search
the kitchen crew inmates--

08:14.368 --> 08:16.704
One of our kitchen workers
smuggled a phone

08:16.787 --> 08:18.873
into the immigration detention center
last night,

08:19.248 --> 08:21.209
and ICE is not happy about it.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.088
I will reach out
and try and smooth it over

08:26.172 --> 08:27.882
so they don't involve corporate.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.428
Send the inmate to me.
We're gonna have to pursue formal charges.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.515
We don't know which inmate is responsible.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.142
Then find out.

08:38.226 --> 08:42.313
Are you giving us authorization
to interrogate inmates?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.232
Do whatever you have to do.

08:47.652 --> 08:51.197
Good morning, I was hoping
to speak with Danny Pearson please.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.326
Ah, yes, I've been calling to discuss
a microloan project

08:55.409 --> 08:59.622
that I'm working on
with a very bright Litchfield inmate.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.127
Uh, Joe Caputo.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.839
Oh, is he?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.343
When exactly do you expect him
to free up?

09:12.426 --> 09:15.721
Because he's been in meetings
the last four times I called, too.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.432
No, I'm not taking a tone with you.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.519
-I just wish he'd stop avoiding me.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.229
Oh, yes, he is. He--

09:23.854 --> 09:26.774
Yes, he is. Yes, he is. I'm not stupid.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.192
He hung up.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.070
How are those calls coming?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.115
No one will even take my call.

09:34.198 --> 09:37.326
They hear my name,
and suddenly, they're busy.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.538
You should try giving up.
It's working for me.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.998
You're not going in to work?

09:42.081 --> 09:47.420
I'm calling in sick because, technically,
I'm sick of their shit.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.673
Why are you so dressed up, Mr. Belvedere?

09:50.756 --> 09:56.846
Oh, well, Tamika's throwing
an end-of-semester party for the programs.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.223
Thought I might go.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.892
You know, hand out the certificates
for restorative justice.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.811
You really think that's a good idea?

10:03.894 --> 10:05.980
Everyone probably knows
you're a sex offender by now.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.524
I am not a sex offender.

10:09.483 --> 10:14.071
I'm a sexual harasser,
and you know the difference.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.241
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Hide in a cave the rest of my life?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.535
I-- I can't make calls, I can't teach.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.249
And-- And Tamika said I can come.
A last visit to say goodbye.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.126
I owe those girls at least that.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.878
Women. They're women.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.507
Those women
do not deserve to be penalized for my--

10:33.591 --> 10:37.803
You can't say "penalized"
anymore. It's a microaggression.

10:38.387 --> 10:42.350
You're also not allowed to invite anyone
out to cocktails

10:42.433 --> 10:44.644
or ask them to take dictation.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.479
You are like a 12-year-old.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.315
Oh, you definitely
can't say "12-year-old."

10:49.398 --> 10:50.483
Ah!

10:54.278 --> 10:56.864
-This is a good fucking sandwich.
-Mmm.

11:05.873 --> 11:06.874
Thanks for coming.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.838
I'm here because I know you're in pain.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.052
I'm sorry that I'm responsible, I just...
I haven't changed my mind.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.556
I know you think
we shouldn't be seeing each other anymore,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.185
but it's because you won't
let yourself be happy.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.314
You know, you actually
make me look forward

11:30.398 --> 11:32.233
to coming to this horrible place.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.488
And I know you feel something, too.
I've seen how you look at me.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.657
I have a wife.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.578
Why do you keep punishing yourself
over and over again,

11:44.662 --> 11:46.664
when you know
you're never gonna be enough for her?

11:46.747 --> 11:49.875
-I can't listen to this. I'm leaving.
-She's gonna leave you.

11:51.293 --> 11:54.296
She was always going to, you know that.
You know it in your heart.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.050
She's seeing someone else.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.347
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.685
I saw them at her apartment last night.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.480
I wasn't planning to confront her,
but when I saw what she was doing...

12:16.485 --> 12:19.196
You stay away from my wife.

13:47.618 --> 13:53.874
<i>♪ And your baby's hanging on</i>

14:20.985 --> 14:22.111
Thank you.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.284
This view...

14:29.618 --> 14:31.412
Yeah.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.331
Sometimes, I forget to enjoy it.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.130
-Oh, shit. Shit.
-Oh. Oh.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.591
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-No, it's okay.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.718
I'll pay for dry cleaning.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.012
Actually, how much does that cost?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.471
Don't worry about it.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.891
Um...

14:56.353 --> 14:57.354
Shit.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.943
-Excuse me. I'm gonna have to take this.
-Yeah.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.072
Hello?

15:09.241 --> 15:10.326
Why didn't you pick up?

15:11.577 --> 15:14.246
Is that really how
you would like to start this conversation?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.919
Look, I'm sorry
that CO showed up at your place.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.254
If I'd known she was gonna do
something like that, I never would've--

15:22.338 --> 15:24.131
You never would've what?
You never would've fucked her?

15:25.132 --> 15:29.345
You sat in front of my face
and you lied to me.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.057
Told me she was forcing you
to sell fucking phone chargers?

15:33.140 --> 15:34.850
What a crock of shit.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.603
What about you

15:38.187 --> 15:39.021
What?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.190
She told me that you're seeing someone.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.401
-Do...
<i></i>

15:46.028 --> 15:47.821
Is that why you didn't answer your phone?

15:50.324 --> 15:51.408
Is it Zelda?

15:52.576 --> 15:54.370
-This is ridiculous.
<i></i> If you're not with her,
just tell me right now.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.249
Say, "No, I am not with Zelda."

16:02.294 --> 16:04.755
Wow, Pipes, even for you.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.424
What is that supposed to mean

16:09.551 --> 16:12.012
We are not doing this over the phone.
You need to come here.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.098
What?

16:34.410 --> 16:37.830
Diaz. Congratulations,
you got a new work assignment.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.499
-I didn't ask for no work assignment.
I ain't askin' if you asked.

16:41.625 --> 16:46.088
Says here you're on the cleaning crew,
and you're assigned to SHU.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.090
The fuck I gotta clean SHU for?

16:48.173 --> 16:51.510
The roaches been complaining?
That shit's closed down.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.762
Head guard makes the assignments.
I just hand them out.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.765
I'm a cog in the prison machine.
Don't shoot the cog.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.392
I don't know what you're bitching about.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.353
You just hit the jackpot.
SHU's a fucking easy one.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.986
No good bastard.
If I ever see Vinnie again,

17:09.069 --> 17:13.032
I'm gonna squeeze his nuts so hard
that his nuts come popping out.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.535
Then he's not gonna have no nuts no more,
just empty sacks.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.872
Lorna, please. I mean, he's just...
You can't keep blaming Vinnie.

17:19.955 --> 17:23.625
Why not? He can't get away with this.
He took my baby away.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.045
-No, he didn't.
-Yes, he did.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.171
No, he didn't.

17:27.921 --> 17:32.634
Look, kid, I understand why
you wouldn't wanna accept what happened,

17:32.718 --> 17:34.344
because that makes it real.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.472
And losing your child...

17:36.555 --> 17:41.560
I mean, that's the kind of pain
that a lot people never recover from.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.772
I-- I almost admire you
for fighting it so hard,

17:44.855 --> 17:47.483
but wh-- when I look at you,
I mean, really look at you,

17:47.566 --> 17:49.860
I can see that a part of you knows.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.571
Sterling is gone.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.739
Yeah.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.533
He died in the hospital.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.287
And pretending that he's still alive
isn't gonna bring him back.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.957
You just--
You gotta let him go so you can grieve.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.716
What's wrong with you?

18:14.468 --> 18:18.013
Why would you say something like that
to me? That's horrible.

18:18.847 --> 18:23.685
Because it's the truth, all right?
You have to start accepting the truth.

18:24.520 --> 18:31.110
You... You are just mad with me
because I never wanted to be with you!

18:32.111 --> 18:35.239
All right. Lorna, you gotta calm down
or they're gonna send you to Florida.

18:35.322 --> 18:39.118
You always hated that I was happy
with Christopher and Vinnie.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.036
And now, you wanna make this stuff up

18:41.120 --> 18:45.082
so I can be miserable and alone forever,
just like you!

18:45.165 --> 18:47.543
-Hey.
Lorna, you have to calm down.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.419
I understand you are mad at me right now,

18:49.503 --> 18:51.922
but, please, bring it down.
I want you here.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.969
You having another episode, Morello?

18:57.678 --> 18:58.512
Uh...

19:00.305 --> 19:02.808
I'm angry, too. You know, I...

19:02.891 --> 19:08.272
I mean, I think it's insane that there's
three starches in this meal, all right?

19:09.356 --> 19:14.236
It's really not recommended for someone
who is pre-pre-diabetic.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.406
-Take it up with the concierge, Nichols.
Yeah.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.201
-And keep it down.
-Aye, aye, captain.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.128
-Remind me.
-Hmm.

19:32.045 --> 19:35.841
How does someone as smart
and gorgeous as you...

19:35.924 --> 19:39.469
-Mmm-hmm.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.140
Oh. I don't really work here.
I just wandered in off the street.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.854
Found this uniform in a hamper
and just never left.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.606
-Mmm-hmm.

19:50.689 --> 19:54.026
So, what drew you in, the stench of death?

19:55.027 --> 19:57.112
Come on, it's gotta be a long way from...

19:58.030 --> 20:00.949
What part of town
did you say you lived in?

20:01.867 --> 20:02.993
I never said.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.205
You

20:06.747 --> 20:13.295
Uh, my sexy black ass, and the fact
that I sneak you extra rice pudding.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.215
Besides those two excellent qualities.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.634
Every other goddamn person in here

20:18.717 --> 20:22.804
wants to ask you about your life
or tell you about theirs.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.017
You keep things light, you know?
I like that.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.063
Thanks, Sid. Uh...

20:33.398 --> 20:35.859
You better watch your sugars, mister.

20:36.610 --> 20:40.989
Yeah, that's what they tell me,
but you only die once.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.452
That's true. That's true.
All right, here we are.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.453
Mmm.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.084
Uh...

20:52.751 --> 20:54.461
-Yeah.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.256
-I'm gonna need your help.
-Mmm. Okay.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.216
Come on.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.843
-Okay. Here we go.
-Uh-huh.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.429
Easy. Okay.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.017
Hang on. Okay. Yeah.
-All right.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.811
Okay.
-Yeah.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.565
-Uh, you okay with...

21:15.899 --> 21:17.442
Ah, what are you gonna do?

21:22.030 --> 21:24.866
Uh, you like Sam Cooke?

21:24.950 --> 21:28.078
Do I like the greatest soul singer
of all time?

21:28.161 --> 21:31.456
-That's what I'm talking about. Here.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.416
Oh.

21:39.381 --> 21:43.844
<i>♪ Whoa, it's all right ♪</i>

21:45.095 --> 21:46.096
Yeah?

21:46.179 --> 21:48.598

21:48.682 --> 21:51.184

Taystee?

22:28.930 --> 22:29.848
What's up?

22:30.474 --> 22:32.726
You gonna tell me or do I have to ask?

22:39.066 --> 22:42.152
Were you just gonna not tell me? Come on.
Girl, you're-- you're killing me here.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.114
There's not much to tell.

22:46.198 --> 22:51.203
I mean, the lawyer
wants to talk to a few more experts

22:51.286 --> 22:52.788
before moving forward, so...

22:52.871 --> 22:54.081
But it's moving forward.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.961
All right. Tha-- Tha--
That's the direction we wanna go then.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.299
Keep hope alive, huh?
We could celebrate at the party tonight.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.135
Yeah. Uh, I'm not going to the party.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.223
I wasn't really
a part of the program, so...

23:11.306 --> 23:14.476
What are you talking about?
Your tutoring was the program.

23:15.894 --> 23:21.566
Look, I was trying to keep it a surprise,
but I'm bringing in a bunch of donuts.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.402
So, you gotta come. Come on.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.531
I'm not going away till you promise.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.991
All right, yeah. All right.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.703
I promise.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.334
-Yo, Tamika.
-Yo.

23:43.880 --> 23:48.135
What if you got Storky's instead?
Instead of donuts.

23:48.718 --> 23:49.719
Storky's.

23:50.429 --> 23:55.392
Such a good idea.
I'm-- I'm-- I'mma make it happen. Got it.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.036
Good afternoon. My name is Mr. Bibby.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.956
I'll be administering
your high school equivalency exam.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.749
Uh, what happened to Luschek?

24:19.833 --> 24:21.668
Your teacher will not be present
for the exam,

24:22.043 --> 24:23.753
and in the future,
if you have any questions,

24:23.837 --> 24:26.339
-please raise your hand.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.050
Okay, damn, you don't have
to come at me like that.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.428
The test is composed of five sections.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.222
When there's a minute left
in each section,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.141
I will give you a one-minute warning.

24:36.224 --> 24:41.980
When your time is up, I will say "time"
and you will put your pencil down,

24:42.063 --> 24:46.193
or your test will be invalid, and you will
be escorted from the exam room.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.571
Yes?

24:49.654 --> 24:53.366
Hi. Uh, what about for people
that get, uh, extra time?

24:53.950 --> 24:55.327
No one's getting extra time.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.622
No, that's not true. I get extra time.
I have a learning disability.

24:58.705 --> 25:02.250
No, I don't have anyone approved
for extended testing time on this roster.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.086
But I--
But I can't take the test without it.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.672
You can-- You can ask Luschek.
He'll tell you.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.218
It's too late. Your teacher should've
made the official request weeks ago.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.594
He did.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.598
My brain is different, all right?
This takes me longer!

25:17.182 --> 25:19.100
I'm sorry. We have to move on.

25:20.852 --> 25:25.774
You're not to open your exam booklet
until I have instructed you to do so.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.492
Officer Alvarez, she's all yours.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.441
I forgot what I was gonna say.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.903
Tell us who smuggled in the phone

26:11.987 --> 26:14.406
or all three of you
are getting five extra years.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.324
Yeah, I think it was something
about a boiled frog.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.368
I really don't know whose phone it is.

26:19.661 --> 26:23.123
I'm sorry. I know it's not mine.
That's all I know.

26:23.498 --> 26:27.419
You better hope your two friends' memories
aren't better than yours.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.381
I can't get more time.

26:33.717 --> 26:37.262
Gloria, please, you have to confess.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.350
Look, I know you ain't never
gonna forgive me.

26:42.434 --> 26:46.479
I'm okay with that, but don't
punish my daughter for my mistakes.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.988
You know Pepa was sick last week?

26:56.531 --> 27:01.286
She had this real bad cough
that kept her up all night crying.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.499
And all I wanted was to be there

27:08.126 --> 27:10.462
to rub <i>alcoholado</i> on her chest

27:11.921 --> 27:14.507
and to read to her the book
that <i>mi mamá</i> used to read to me.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.593
You know, the one about the sick donkey?

27:18.553 --> 27:21.723
You had that book in Puerto Rico,
the one with the song?

27:53.254 --> 27:55.090
I respect what you did.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.720
You put yourself out there
for somebody else's kid.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.516
I'm not gonna snitch.

28:07.268 --> 28:12.148
But, please, don't keep me from mine.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.445
Give her the chance to know me
while she's still a child.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.124
The fuck is happening to this place?

28:35.964 --> 28:38.591
This is a maximum security prison.

28:39.300 --> 28:42.387
It's like a unicorn diarrhea-blasted
the whole fucking room.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.640
I don't know.
I find it kind of invigorating.

28:47.475 --> 28:51.146
I'm sorry, what--
what the fuck word did you say to me?

28:51.229 --> 28:53.398
"Invigorating"

28:53.481 --> 28:55.108
Yup.
-Mr. Hopper.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.317
It makes you feel good. From Aleida.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.863
Are you trying to say something with that?

28:59.946 --> 29:00.947
You need to have a heart -to understand what I mean.
It's a cute word.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.199
-No, I know what it means.
Oh, do you?

29:03.283 --> 29:04.659
It's a little cutesy word.
Tell me what it means.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.035
I know what it means.
What does it mean?

29:06.119 --> 29:08.830
What are you hiding?
-I'm not hiding anything.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.373
-Gentlemen, I got some paperwork to do.
Mr. Invigorating.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.958
-I'll catch you later.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.252
-Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.880
-Mmm-hmm. Oof.
-Makes my butthole tingle. Killjoy.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.556
Hello?

29:36.816 --> 29:37.859
Hello?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.907
Please don't be anthrax or shit.

29:56.377 --> 30:00.298
Okay. Okay, you know--
Can you wait one second?

30:00.381 --> 30:03.051
Stop pushing me forward.
This place is fucking disgusting.

30:03.134 --> 30:06.012
I don't wanna touch anything. You...
Okay, you know what?

30:06.638 --> 30:07.472
Ow.

30:08.556 --> 30:11.100
-Okay, this is better.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.436
-No, I meant the position.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.439
I'm not... Shit. Yeah, now I'm in.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.900
Okay. Yeah, you don't have to narrate it.
I can tell.

30:19.484 --> 30:23.112
Oh, God. Yeah, I'm in. I'm in, in, in.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.658
Oh, God. This is exactly what I needed.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.661
Thank you, honey. This was a great idea.

30:29.744 --> 30:32.956
This is actually not that bad.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.208
-God.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.377
Oh, no, no, no. SHU was all you.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.504
Yeah, no. You're the one that told me
to come down here.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.798
Oh, I get it. You want me
to be the big, bad guard

30:41.881 --> 30:44.175
taking you down to SHU
for a little extra punishment, huh?

30:44.259 --> 30:46.386
-All right. Well, you're gonna get a shot.
-Okay.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.179
-And another shot. And another.

30:48.263 --> 30:52.475
And another. And another shot.
Another shot. Another shot. Another shot.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.645
-Step away from the inmate, CO.
No, no, no.

30:55.728 --> 31:00.275
No, no, no.
This is a misunderstanding.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.193
I literally caught you
with your pants down.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.987
How exactly am I misunderstanding that?

31:05.280 --> 31:08.157
We're in a relationship.
Her kids live with me.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.244
We're-- We're basically married. Tell her.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.996
Yeah. He takes care of my kids.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.039
That doesn't change anything.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.500
-CO Hopper...
-Please. He's all my kids got.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.585
Inmate.

31:19.294 --> 31:23.798
-Warden. Warden, please. I need this job.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.426
Finally learned how to call me
by my title.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.263
-You're fired, Mr. Hopper.
-No, no, no.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.265
Either that,
or I can file charges with the court,

31:32.348 --> 31:33.683
see what they think of this arrangement?

31:35.935 --> 31:39.314
CO Blake, please escort Ms. Diaz
back to her cell.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.026
CO Young, please escort Mr. Hopper
off the premises.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.913
Damn, Hopper, you got set up.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.050
-Yeah.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.801
They must still be down there.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.726
Shit, shit, shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.188
I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.566
Yes! Yo, Tylenol. Thank you.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.530
Hmm. Let's go.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.701
Yes.

32:44.921 --> 32:45.755
Shit.

32:49.842 --> 32:53.763
-Well, I won't deny that it's unusual.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.810
Chickens are social creatures.
They need chicken-on-chicken contact.

32:58.893 --> 33:02.313
No. We need to stop
the chicken-on-chicken violence.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.024
What if this isolation
is just making them more violent?

33:05.108 --> 33:09.153
Ugh.
-You got them literally cooped up.

33:09.237 --> 33:14.492
What if the solution
is more social interaction, not less?

33:14.575 --> 33:15.535
No.

33:16.536 --> 33:20.081
These chickens are bloodthirsty predators.
Superpredators.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.083
Look, I can see it in their eyes.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.251
-No.
-Yes.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.921
Now, I know it is not ideal,

33:27.005 --> 33:29.841
but it is the only solution
that we've got.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.305
Look, an egg!

33:41.144 --> 33:43.271
Now, I can make breakfast for dinner.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.232
How lucky is that?

34:05.209 --> 34:08.713
You have one minute left
in the math section.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.049
-Time.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.718
Put your pencils down.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.222
Pencils down.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.811
This will conclude
your high school equivalency exam.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.688
Please remain seated
as I collect your Scantron sheets.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.206
"Yeah, this big house is a fixer-upper.

35:25.998 --> 35:30.795
360 views of gray walls,
and the plumbing is a motherfucker."

35:32.630 --> 35:36.259
"Don't you pay no never mind
to that soot falling from the ceiling.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.928
That's from all the prayers
that turned to ash before they left the building.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.182
Guess that means it got character, right

35:44.934 --> 35:46.477
Mmm. I dig it.

35:49.272 --> 35:52.525
Do you feel that, huh? Those vibrations.

35:52.608 --> 35:53.901
Take your shirt off!

35:57.029 --> 35:58.781
Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm starving.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.326
Okay, everyone, calm down.
The burgers are coming.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.872
We'll be back with more vibrations
after a brief intermission.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.874
Mr. Caputo.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.752
These look like you just wrote our names
in Magic Marker.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.421
That's what I did.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.716
Then I guess you're the one
that really needs forgiveness, huh?

36:16.799 --> 36:18.718
For giving us janky certificates.

36:19.093 --> 36:21.596
Thank you for your feedback, Mx. Tawney.

36:36.402 --> 36:40.531
Mr. Caputo, I wanted
to tell you something, if that's okay?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.950
Of course, Beth. What

36:44.410 --> 36:49.207
When I found out I was coming here,
I-- I knew it would be difficult.

36:49.290 --> 36:53.586
And I expected I wouldn't have
any friends, which is true.

36:53.669 --> 36:57.423
I don't have a single friend in here,
but I'm okay with that.

36:58.341 --> 37:02.470
But what I couldn't prepare for was how
hard it would be for people to look at me.

37:10.853 --> 37:12.063
I'm sorry.

37:13.147 --> 37:14.148
That's awful.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.401
I-- I try
when some of the new girls arrive,

37:17.485 --> 37:20.947
but as soon as they find out what I did,
they stop, too.

37:21.697 --> 37:25.284
And I-- I understand why.
I wouldn't wanna look at me, either.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.746
-Oh, Beth, don't--
-You don't have to do that, Mr. Caputo.

37:28.829 --> 37:34.043
I-- I know what I did. I know what my face
makes them think about.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.463
I have to live with that.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.634
But, uh, that's not what I-- I came over
to tell you.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.219
I wanted to thank you,

37:43.803 --> 37:46.013
because since your program,

37:46.097 --> 37:47.723
some of the other
restorative justice girls

37:47.807 --> 37:49.475
started to look at me again,

37:49.558 --> 37:52.270
and some of them even smile at me
when they do.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.855
That's real nice to hear. Thank you.

37:55.606 --> 37:56.983
I guess what I'm...

37:57.733 --> 38:00.695
What I'm trying to say is
it doesn't last forever.

38:01.279 --> 38:05.032
If it ever seems like people
are turning away from you.

38:10.871 --> 38:11.872
You heard?

38:13.582 --> 38:16.836
I'm pretty sure
some of the other girls know, too.

38:17.586 --> 38:19.880
I'm sorry to let you guys down like that.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.470
Uh, I guess you understand now
why I have to go away.

38:27.722 --> 38:31.017
Mr. Caputo, if-- if anyone has taught us

38:31.100 --> 38:33.769
that people deserve a path to redemption,
it's you.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.358
Besides, who are we to judge?

38:43.029 --> 38:46.073
-Hey, good-for-nothing asshole.
-Hey.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.616
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?

38:48.284 --> 38:50.411
I don't know. Too many drugs
before my brain fully developed?

38:50.494 --> 38:51.746
You made me fail my test.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.122
Hey, calm it down, kid.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.583
Wait a minute. That's not really my fault.
I can only give you the tools--

38:55.666 --> 38:59.545
Oh, really? You were supposed to request
more time for my dyslexia!

38:59.628 --> 39:02.548
Do you remember that

39:03.174 --> 39:04.675
Do you know how hard I studied
for that test?

39:04.759 --> 39:06.969
I studied my fucking ass off!
Do you know what you've done to me?

39:07.053 --> 39:08.262
Okay, Doggett.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.264
-Let's calm down over here.
-No, 'cause I've known some real

39:10.348 --> 39:13.684
fucking pieces of shit in my life,
but you, you're fucking garbage!

39:13.768 --> 39:15.102
Pure fucking shit!

39:15.186 --> 39:16.437
All right. All right. Let's go.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.077
Would you look at that?

39:45.383 --> 39:49.804
You look like shit, Nicky.
I almost didn't recognize you.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.641
Well, I got a lot on my plate right now.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.654
Don't get me started on Morello.

40:06.737 --> 40:10.157
I've been chasing her around all day,
trying to keep her out of trouble.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.868
Thank fucking Christ,
she finally went down for a nap.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.704
You've always loved her, haven't you?

40:18.290 --> 40:24.672
I might have a soft spot for her,
but it's platonic.

40:30.344 --> 40:31.720
Yeah, could've been.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.349
And what happened to her?

40:36.642 --> 40:42.064
She's gone. You know what?
Uh, let's not talk about me.

40:43.399 --> 40:49.363
How did you get to be so good
at being a prison mom?

40:52.199 --> 40:55.119
-I had a good teacher.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.789
Beautiful, striking woman.

41:00.499 --> 41:05.796
Her name is Galina,
but some people call her Red.

41:07.298 --> 41:12.094
Come on. It's a-- It's a serious question.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.597
And I gave you serious answer.

41:15.723 --> 41:20.060
I didn't know what I was doing.
I figured it out.

41:20.144 --> 41:23.105
All right, but you ran a whole kitchen.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.859
I mean, you watched over
a bunch of degenerate knuckleheads,

41:26.942 --> 41:29.945
not to mention
how you got a big-mouthed junkie

41:30.029 --> 41:32.031
from the Upper East clean, you know?

41:32.114 --> 41:34.575
That is some crazy multitasking
right there.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.619
Well...

41:38.996 --> 41:44.001
I raised three boys,
I ran a business and I just...

41:45.753 --> 41:46.754
did.

41:48.964 --> 41:50.966
I think sometimes you get so busy,

41:51.050 --> 41:53.594
you don't have time to wonder
how you're doing it all.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.138
You do it.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.518
And then sometimes you hit a wall,
and you say...

42:02.102 --> 42:05.940
"Okay, that's all I can handle."

42:09.944 --> 42:13.781
And you back off
and try not to get near the wall again.

42:16.492 --> 42:22.831
Okay, but what if you-- you really
don't wanna give up on something?

42:24.333 --> 42:29.588
Even though, I mean, you know that it just
might be too much for you to handle,

42:29.672 --> 42:34.051
like, even if you've just slammed
into that wall?

42:36.720 --> 42:41.433
There's strength in admitting
what you can't do.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.273
Nobody likes it...

42:48.857 --> 42:51.068
but it's self-preservation.

42:56.699 --> 43:00.869
It's getting late. Can you get Norma,
Gina and Tricia for me?

43:01.495 --> 43:04.373
It's time to start preparing dinner soon.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.465
Uh...

43:14.425 --> 43:16.510
Can we just stay here a little longer?

43:20.347 --> 43:24.435
-Okay, <i>dochenka,</i> a little longer.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.628
All right. One at a time.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.969
Hey, you know if Suzanne is coming?

43:59.053 --> 44:00.095
Mmm.

44:02.765 --> 44:05.517
Listen, I really wish I could stay
and kick it,

44:05.601 --> 44:08.270
but today has
been straight bullshit, so...

44:08.604 --> 44:10.397
I wanted to tell you that--

44:11.607 --> 44:13.108
Uh, yeah. What's up?

44:14.693 --> 44:15.986
Nothing...

44:16.779 --> 44:20.991
I just wanted to say
that I appreciate you trying...

44:22.451 --> 44:24.036
with the programs.

44:25.996 --> 44:30.834
Look, I hope... I hope you keep it up.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.587
Damn straight, we're gonna keep it up.

44:34.588 --> 44:37.341
Now, what are you waiting for, woman?

44:37.424 --> 44:40.094
Hurry up, get in line. This is your idea.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.355
Taystee.

44:52.314 --> 44:53.273
Oh.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.443
-I'm glad I caught you.
-Hi, Mr. Caputo.

44:57.736 --> 45:00.280
I wanted to apologize in person

45:00.364 --> 45:03.659
for not making any progress
on the loans for ex-felons thing.

45:03.742 --> 45:06.829
-Nah, it's all right.
-Uh...

45:07.705 --> 45:11.917
Truth is, I'm probably doing more harm
than good just being associated with it.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.836
But you should reach out to people
on your own.

45:13.919 --> 45:16.714
It might be good for them to hear
from somebody who's been there.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.800
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.305
I really am sorry, Taystee,
I couldn't do more.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.435
Nah. You did everything you could.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.773
I won't be around the prison much
'cause I'm not doing

45:34.857 --> 45:37.067
restorative justice anymore. So, I might not see you for a while.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.908
I'd give you a big hug goodbye, but...

45:50.956 --> 45:52.666
I'll see you, Taystee.

45:55.794 --> 45:57.838
You're a good man, Mr. Caputo.

46:01.258 --> 46:02.468
You take care.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.475
Look, we know you didn't do it.

46:09.558 --> 46:13.520
You've been working all this time
with zero incidents.

46:14.146 --> 46:15.856
Just tell us it was Ruiz.

46:17.691 --> 46:21.195
If you don't tell us,
then you're all getting added time.

46:25.574 --> 46:28.452
Officer Alvarez,
can you tell me what that file says?

46:31.163 --> 46:35.793
I'm sorry, I don't...
What am I supposed to be referencing?

46:36.418 --> 46:40.380
The release date. Obviously,
I'm asking about her release date.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.301
My release date is nine days away.

46:51.475 --> 46:54.812
Officer Alvarez, tell her what happens
to that release date

46:54.895 --> 46:58.941
if she gets another five years added
to her sentence.

47:04.738 --> 47:05.989
Seriously

47:18.544 --> 47:21.171
I apologize, okay?
I shouldn't have yelled.

47:21.922 --> 47:24.466
You couldn't have known
I was asking about the release date,

47:24.550 --> 47:26.677
because I didn't ask
for that specifically.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.305
-I'm sorry.
Thank you.

47:39.147 --> 47:41.233
If you get another five years,

47:41.775 --> 47:44.152
that's five more years
away from your kids.

47:47.281 --> 47:50.367
Can you live with yourself
keeping children from their mother?

47:51.743 --> 47:53.245
I love my kids.

47:55.581 --> 47:56.874
We know.

47:58.125 --> 48:02.254
So, you gonna tell us
who smuggled the phone?

48:06.633 --> 48:08.135
I'm so sorry.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.105
I did.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.825
Hey, any of y'all seen Suzanne?

48:36.371 --> 48:37.831
Professor T!

48:40.792 --> 48:44.630
Yo, this Storky's is bomb as fuck.

48:44.713 --> 48:47.424
I'm gonna pretend that they use
sustainable farmers and ranches and shit.

48:47.507 --> 48:49.801
-I hope I'm right.
-Yeah, man.

48:49.885 --> 48:52.846
Respect to whoever made this shit happen.

48:52.930 --> 48:53.972
Yeah.

48:55.015 --> 48:57.809
The gravy bundle
really brings it together.

48:57.893 --> 49:02.981
Yo, teach, I killed my test today.
Finished early and everything.

49:03.065 --> 49:07.194
With the rise of automation,
a GED is little more than symbolic.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.696
A damp newspaper to shield you
from the coming monsoon. Damn right. Fuck the GED.

49:14.117 --> 49:18.080
Ladies, I think it's time
we take this party up a notch, right?

49:19.331 --> 49:20.332
Come on.

49:22.751 --> 49:23.585
Yo.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.130
-I'll catch up with you in the laundry.
-All right.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.304
Finally got your last meal, huh?

49:35.263 --> 49:37.766
Guess I shouldn't say
"I'll see you later" then.

49:40.102 --> 49:43.814
Well, at least you found your way
out this place.

49:54.324 --> 49:55.659
What happened to you?

49:57.577 --> 49:58.745
I fuckin' failed.

49:59.162 --> 50:01.164
They didn't give her her extra time.

50:01.248 --> 50:04.167
Well, then you can just take it again
in a few months.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.379
Why

50:08.463 --> 50:11.591
I don't need some fuckin' test
to tell me how stupid I am.

50:41.663 --> 50:45.333
I'm so sorry that I'm late. The bus...
This is a disaster.

50:45.417 --> 50:48.253
The bus I usually catch
wasn't running on time and it...

50:49.129 --> 50:50.255
How much time do we have?

50:50.338 --> 50:51.840
They're gonna cut these off
any minute now.

50:54.509 --> 50:56.136
How many times did you fuck her?

50:58.096 --> 51:01.349
Just once. After I found out
about you and the guard.

51:02.642 --> 51:04.686
How many times did you and her...

51:05.270 --> 51:07.564
You know what? Don't answer that.
I don't wanna know.

51:09.316 --> 51:11.359
Was any of the stuff
about the phone chargers true?

51:11.443 --> 51:15.447
Yes. She made me sell them.
But we stopped after...

51:15.530 --> 51:18.784
Don't even... don't. No more lies.

51:19.576 --> 51:24.873
I can't handle any more lies.
We have to be honest with each other.

51:26.666 --> 51:30.462
Okay, ask me anything you want,
and I'll tell you the truth.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.050
Do you have feelings for her?

51:41.056 --> 51:43.058
Then why did you do it?

51:44.518 --> 51:47.979
I think I was trying to protect myself,

51:49.564 --> 51:54.569
because your life is out there now,
and I was scared that you would leave me.

51:55.821 --> 51:58.198
Why would you think that?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.992
A part of me always knew
it was a possibility,

52:01.952 --> 52:05.705
because when things get hard,
it's easier for you to leave.

52:06.623 --> 52:09.835
-That's not fair.
-It wouldn't be the first time, Pipes.

52:11.002 --> 52:12.754
I don't believe that about myself.

52:16.007 --> 52:17.467
So, how do we solve it?

52:19.219 --> 52:21.680
I can't spend
the next three years like this.

52:26.476 --> 52:29.146
How do I show you
you don't need to be afraid?

52:31.022 --> 52:33.400
You tell me
you don't have feelings for Zelda.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.033
I can't lie to you.

52:50.125 --> 52:52.460
So, what are we supposed to do now?

52:54.171 --> 52:55.755
Is this something that...

52:58.633 --> 53:01.219
is this something that we can survive?

53:03.346 --> 53:04.556
I don't know.

53:06.641 --> 53:10.645
No matter what happens,
Alex, I want you--

53:13.481 --> 53:15.400
Okay, it's time to go, ladies.

53:30.498 --> 53:33.710
I could never stop loving you.

53:47.682 --> 53:49.935
-Door's open!

53:50.477 --> 53:52.020
Unless you want something.

53:53.772 --> 53:56.233
Door's open even if you want something.

54:01.863 --> 54:05.700
You gonna sit down?
I'm up to date on all my cootie shots.

54:09.079 --> 54:13.458
That's funny.
I thought you might be at your party.

54:13.541 --> 54:17.379
Well, not with all this riveting
corporate paperwork calling me.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.006
I take it you heard about Hopper?

54:20.632 --> 54:24.761
Hmm. If it wasn't another incident
for PolyCon to hold against me,

54:24.844 --> 54:28.765
I would be jumping for joy
for sending his potato-white butt packing.

54:30.016 --> 54:32.269
That's kind of what I came here
to talk about.

54:33.061 --> 54:35.230
You wanna talk about Hopper's white butt?

54:36.189 --> 54:39.859
Sorry, no. I have a favor to ask.

54:41.820 --> 54:43.113
What's goin' on?

54:45.532 --> 54:49.327
Remember how you said you wanted me
to be your girl on the inside?

54:51.037 --> 54:55.292
I was hoping to help you avoid
another potential incident, because...

54:58.003 --> 54:59.587
I'm in love with an inmate.

55:09.222 --> 55:11.099
What the hell is wrong with you?

55:13.727 --> 55:17.314
-I could fire you just for saying that!
-I haven't acted on it.

55:17.397 --> 55:18.773
And you're not going to.

55:18.857 --> 55:22.652
I don't want to,
but it's getting harder to manage.

55:22.736 --> 55:26.698
Then take an exercise class.
Make a dating profile.

55:26.781 --> 55:28.241
What do you expect me to do about it?

55:28.325 --> 55:30.535
I want you to transfer her
out of the prison.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.538
I can't take seeing her face every day.

55:35.832 --> 55:38.585
And that way,
you can guarantee there's no incident.

55:38.668 --> 55:39.502
Hmm.

55:40.670 --> 55:44.883
You know, another way to guarantee
there's no incident is to fire your ass.

55:45.717 --> 55:48.261
Yeah, you could fire me.

55:48.970 --> 55:52.140
But you can't really afford to lose
another guard right now, can you?

56:05.362 --> 56:10.325
Oh, he is so handsome
with his two cute little eyes,

56:10.867 --> 56:12.911
and his cute little eyeballs,

56:13.453 --> 56:17.624
and his cute little black things
in the middle of his eyes.

56:17.707 --> 56:19.667
Morello, could you shut
your fucking mouth?

56:19.751 --> 56:22.837
His cute little eye color,
and his cute little lashes.

56:22.921 --> 56:25.090
Didn't you hear me?
I said shut the fuck up.

56:25.173 --> 56:28.301
Hey. Don't get mad at Morello
just 'cause you picked a shitty time

56:28.385 --> 56:32.639
to drop out of your program, huh?
Why don't you eat your pot

56:32.722 --> 56:35.725
First, it's not pie,
because it doesn't have a crust. Second, if I have to hear another thing
about her baby's little--

56:38.895 --> 56:43.817
-Teeny-tiny, itty-bitty wiener.
Hey. Morello.

56:44.651 --> 56:49.364
Listen closely to what I'm gonna say next
because it's very important.

56:50.198 --> 56:51.741
Fuck your baby.

56:52.492 --> 56:55.703
Lorna, calm down, yeah?

56:55.787 --> 56:59.958
What did you just say to me?

57:01.126 --> 57:04.045
I said, "Fuck your baby."

57:05.213 --> 57:07.382
Right on that soft spot on his head.

57:07.924 --> 57:12.262
Stick a dick right in there
and brain-fuck your baby.

57:20.186 --> 57:26.359
Lorna. Hey, I love you, kid.
I'm gonna miss you like hell.

57:28.611 --> 57:30.321
All right, you.

57:30.405 --> 57:35.410
When I look at you, I see a piece of shit,
disgusting, horrible person.

57:35.493 --> 57:36.911
Officer, I need some help.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.581
And I am gonna fuck up your face.

57:44.919 --> 57:47.422
What are you doing? She is the sick one!

57:47.505 --> 57:51.634
Did you hear what she said to me?
She should die. You should die!

57:51.718 --> 57:55.263
Somebody should fuck you
right in the fontanel, you fucking bitch!

57:55.638 --> 57:58.349
-You're lucky Psych's closed down.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.980
Fuck you, you prison bitch!

58:21.915 --> 58:26.377
I told you to leave me alone.
I thought I was pretty clear about that.

58:27.378 --> 58:30.965
Yeah, you were. So, I did you a favor.

58:32.592 --> 58:35.011
You're being transferred
to another prison.

58:35.094 --> 58:36.346
You can't do that.

58:39.140 --> 58:41.851
Are you crazy? You can't do that!

58:41.935 --> 58:44.437
I have to stay in New York.
I have to be near my wife.

58:45.396 --> 58:46.898
Back in your bunk!

58:48.816 --> 58:51.444
I think you might've forgotten
where you are, inmate.

59:35.238 --> 59:38.783
Hey, you all right?

59:44.414 --> 59:47.792
You lost

59:54.549 --> 59:59.679
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'll be okay.

1:00:29.584 --> 1:00:32.295
-Hey.
Hey.

1:00:33.755 --> 1:00:34.756
How'd it go?

1:00:37.133 --> 1:00:38.259
Ah...

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:42.055
It was okay.

1:00:43.139 --> 1:00:44.766
I made dinner.

1:00:51.981 --> 1:00:55.610
One of the women said a few things
that really touched me.

1:00:55.943 --> 1:00:57.278
I hope you didn't touch her back.

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:00.490
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

1:01:02.909 --> 1:01:04.243
Who was it?

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.830
Um, Beth.

1:01:09.791 --> 1:01:13.878
-I don't know, Hoefler, or...

1:01:15.922 --> 1:01:20.885
Beth Hoefler. She new?
It's not ringing a bell for some reason.

1:01:20.968 --> 1:01:23.971
Not new. Brown hair, yea high.

1:01:26.265 --> 1:01:27.809
Still nothing.

1:01:29.352 --> 1:01:31.729
-She killed her kids.
-Oh. Beth the Baby Killer.

1:01:32.397 --> 1:01:33.981
Hmm. What'd she say?

1:01:35.358 --> 1:01:38.653
She said she thought
I deserved a path to redemption.

1:01:40.655 --> 1:01:44.826
Hmm. Not a great source,
but solid sentiment.

1:01:48.621 --> 1:01:51.040
I decided I'm gonna
go back to work tomorrow.

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:53.584
-Fight the good fight and all that.
-Good for you.

1:01:53.668 --> 1:01:57.130
-At least one of us should be employed.
You think?

1:01:58.423 --> 1:02:01.008
I guess we should have some income, huh?

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:07.265
I hope there's a path to redemption
for me.

1:02:09.517 --> 1:02:10.852
Me, too.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:17.400
Me, too.

1:02:22.697 --> 1:02:25.408
-Me...
-I get it. You're such a bitch.

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:12.914
Fuck you!

1:03:12.997 --> 1:03:15.166
Fuck you, man!
I'm tired of you giving me shit.

-Just seeing what you gals are doin'.
-Nah, she's just a tryhard.

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:54.181
You think she's a tryhard now,
you should've seen her at camp.

1:04:54.265 --> 1:04:55.308
She smoked her teeth off.

1:04:57.685 --> 1:04:59.020
I'm not a tryhard, okay?

1:04:59.103 --> 1:05:04.191
I just was sick of this fucking party
and sick of these fucking programs.

1:05:05.109 --> 1:05:08.070
Everyone just sittin' around
pretending that they ain't in prison.

1:05:08.154 --> 1:05:11.282

about that dumbass test.

"This is Your Brain on Drugs."
Any questions?

1:05:26.797 --> 1:05:29.216
-I don't get it.
-Of course you don't.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:31.802
You fucking millennials
don't respect history, yo.

1:05:35.139 --> 1:05:39.310
Yo, you know what
I'm in the mood for? A soda from Storky's.

1:05:39.393 --> 1:05:40.519
-Oh!
Yeah.

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:43.773
Yo, let's do it. You in, Tali?

1:05:43.856 --> 1:05:44.857
You know I would,

1:05:44.941 --> 1:05:48.945
but I'd really like to see this project
through to the end, boss.

1:05:50.321 --> 1:05:52.448
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1:05:52.782 --> 1:05:54.992

-Nothing.

1:06:23.437 --> 1:06:30.361

is gonna handle that big bag alone.

Doreen, you know this ain't right.

We did everything you asked us to do.

1:08:27.770 --> 1:08:30.147
You can't do this!
Where are we supposed to go?

1:08:30.231 --> 1:08:33.484
That ain't my problem, Laniece.
Now, you need to pack up.

1:08:33.567 --> 1:08:35.194
This is some bullshit!

1:08:35.277 --> 1:08:37.363
Girl, bye.
Just get your stuff and go.

1:08:37.446 --> 1:08:39.240
What happened?
-Yo.

1:08:39.323 --> 1:08:42.243
Building super found out
she got people sleepin' here.

1:08:42.326 --> 1:08:44.829
Say she evicted if everybody
not out by tonight.

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:47.832
Girl, you got somewhere you can go?

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:53.712
Antoine got a cousin in East New York
say he can take us in.

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:55.548
But we gotta earn our keep.

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:59.969
I ain't selling drugs no more.
If I get popped, they gonna send me back.

1:09:00.052 --> 1:09:01.345
It's that or the street.

1:09:07.351 --> 1:09:08.352
Shit. Hello?

1:09:10.312 --> 1:09:12.898
<i>Hello, an inmate</i>
<i>from Litchfield Correctional Facility</i>

1:09:12.982 --> 1:09:16.861
<i></i>
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I accept.

1:09:16.944 --> 1:09:18.654
You got your mansion yet?

1:09:18.737 --> 1:09:20.906
<i>Girl, you know that's</i>
<i>the first thing I did.</i>

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:23.450
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Yo, how many rooms it got?

1:09:23.534 --> 1:09:26.370
-Twenty-seven.
<i></i>

1:09:26.453 --> 1:09:28.873
Yeah, I wanna make sure
there's enough space for everybody.

1:09:28.956 --> 1:09:33.043
You know, you, Cindy, Suzanne, Janae.

1:09:33.127 --> 1:09:35.754
Shit, even Miss Claudette can stay
if she act right.

1:09:35.838 --> 1:09:39.425
Look at you, gettin' all soft
and shit now that you out.

1:09:39.508 --> 1:09:41.927
But, look,
how

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:47.099
I'm all right, you know.
I got a job offer.

1:09:47.183 --> 1:09:50.561
<i>-Yeah...</i>

1:09:51.145 --> 1:09:54.315
I'm just, uh, tired, P.

1:09:55.274 --> 1:09:57.776
Tired of fuckin' struggling.

1:09:57.860 --> 1:10:02.323
This world ain't built for people like me.
Maybe I should go back to where you at.

1:10:02.406 --> 1:10:04.575
At least that way, we can be together.

1:10:05.284 --> 1:10:08.370
<i>-You don't know the future, T.</i>
I gotta go.

1:10:09.079 --> 1:10:10.873
<i>Hey, no.</i>
<i>Hey, hold up. Hold up, T.</i>

1:10:11.665 --> 1:10:14.376
Look, I know I told you
about when my moms passed, right?

1:10:14.752 --> 1:10:15.836
Yeah.

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:18.756
I know I told you it hurt,
but I never told you how much.

1:10:19.465 --> 1:10:20.841
It was like this...

1:10:20.925 --> 1:10:24.094
It was like this sharp pain
in my chest that wouldn't go away.

1:10:24.678 --> 1:10:27.431
I didn't wanna live without her.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

1:10:28.307 --> 1:10:29.725
I think so.

1:10:30.517 --> 1:10:31.810
<i>Look, I was tired, too.</i>

1:10:31.894 --> 1:10:34.730
But that sharp pain,
it didn't last forever.

1:10:34.813 --> 1:10:37.358
It got dull, and... and then it went away.

1:10:37.441 --> 1:10:41.195
Or-- Or it was still there,
but I-- I couldn't feel it as much,

1:10:41.278 --> 1:10:43.030
'cause I had these other feelings.

1:10:43.572 --> 1:10:45.407
'Cause of all the good things
I never expected.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:49.954
What good things? You in prison, P.
What are you talking about?

1:10:50.037 --> 1:10:51.914
I'm talkin' about you.

1:10:53.290 --> 1:10:56.126
You know, wh-- what kinda life
would that've been if I never met you?

1:10:57.628 --> 1:11:01.048
<i>You just-- You gotta hold on</i>
<i>a little longer than you think you can,</i>

1:11:01.131 --> 1:11:06.262
'cause there's good shit working its way
to you that you don't even know about.

1:11:09.390 --> 1:11:14.144
Yeah. There's good stuff headed my way.

1:11:14.228 --> 1:11:17.940
-Look, I gotta go.
-Yeah, all right, girl. Stay up.

1:11:19.441 --> 1:11:22.403
And, um... Look, when I get out,

1:11:22.486 --> 1:11:24.989
we gonna throw
a big-ass party in your mansion.

1:11:25.072 --> 1:11:28.325
Different DJs in all 27 rooms.

1:11:30.619 --> 1:11:31.829
I love you, T.

1:11:33.539 --> 1:11:34.832
I love you too, P.

1:11:59.648 --> 1:12:01.817
You goin' with them or us?

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:06.071
I'm goin' with y'all.
