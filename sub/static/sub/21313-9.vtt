Attention, Superstore shoppers.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.881
Stock up on cold weather gear,

00:20.970 --> 00:25.430
now ten percent off
with our September Super Savings Sale.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.357
Hey, sport. How can I help?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.746
Wanna handle her first,
or you ready to buy?

00:42.830 --> 00:44.036
I'm ready.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.826
You got a photo ID?

00:48.420 --> 00:51.332
All right. Just gonna need you
to ﬁll this out here.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.468
Pen there. There you go.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.677
You want a scope
and a sling for that, too?

00:55.760 --> 00:56.966
Yes, please.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.132
Does make for a nicer profile.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.847
Now this sling might give you
a little trouble.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.760
These little spring clips...

01:10.110 --> 01:12.817
If you need any assistance,
just let me know.

01:14.150 --> 01:16.277
There you go. Let's see this.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.822
Think you made a mistake here. This one.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.661
if you're acquiring it
on behalf of someone else.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.910
Think you meant to check that box?

01:36.510 --> 01:37.829
That's the one.

01:38.550 --> 01:42.384
All right. You want
a high-capacity magazine with that?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.347
-Okay.
-Good call.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.261
Okay, you're all set.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.726
Have a Superstore day!

01:56.240 --> 01:57.389
I got it.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.446
Thanks, man.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.656
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.947
You promise you'll keep that safety on?

02:05.040 --> 02:06.109
I promise.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.610
-See ya.
-See ya.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.616
You kids ready?
We're gonna be late.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.861
I can't find my Chucks.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.782
Well, pick some different shoes,
'cause we're leaving, okay?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.128
Jonah, do you hear me?
We gotta go, pal. Come on.

03:03.390 --> 03:04.459
I poured you a cup.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.186
Thank you.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.601
Do you want me to go
to the church with you today?

03:21.030 --> 03:24.522
Uh, no, it's okay.
I can deal with Nix myself.

03:29.790 --> 03:32.782
-You didn't need to sleep on the couch.
-I felt like I should.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.416
Charlotte, Jonah, get a move on.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.560
He just sits there.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.526
Who is he?

04:05.280 --> 04:06.816
Is he dangerous?

04:06.910 --> 04:08.901
Uh, no. He's not dangerous.
He's a colleague.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.821
- Why don't you wave to him?

04:49.200 --> 04:50.235
What, Buddy?

04:50.830 --> 04:52.195
Oh, nothing.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.570
I was just thinking...

04:55.750 --> 05:00.039
if my ex-wife and I had
had it out like that...

05:00.800 --> 05:04.292
...we might still be together.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.006
Anyway. . .

05:09.550 --> 05:14.010
the two of you are up to your ballsacks
in drama, tell you that.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.893
Burn patterns point
to this spot right here.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.437
Used an accelerant, probably gasoline.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.101
What my fire guy says, anyway.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.481
You know anyone
might want to burn this place down?

05:34.040 --> 05:35.155
Mr. Byrde?

05:36.330 --> 05:39.072
Uh, can't think of anyone, no.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.956
And you intend to collect insurance
on this property?

05:43.590 --> 05:47.219
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I got a, uh,
builder's risk policy,

05:47.300 --> 05:49.006
but we weren't that far into construction,

05:49.090 --> 05:52.548
so I doubt it's even gonna cover
the cost to clear the site.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.473
Yeah, well, you won't be clearing the site
anytime soon, anyway.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.597
This arson investigation,
it'll take a while.

05:59.270 --> 06:01.431
I've got a... I got a crew coming in

06:01.520 --> 06:03.932
to haul all this stuff away
this afternoon.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.850
Well, sorry. No can do.

06:10.070 --> 06:14.154
Sheriff, you don't understand. I've got
a contract to clear this property.

06:14.790 --> 06:17.657
Well, and you don't understand,
I have an active crime scene.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.207
Which means
your work IS gonna have to wait.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.876
End of story.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.376
Excuse me.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.511
And change to you.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.806
Thank you.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.857
I convinced the pastor
to go back out onto the water.

06:43.940 --> 06:46.147
You didn't have to burn
that goddamn place down.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.027
Plus, I could have bulldozed it, you know.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.395
I could have used the expenses.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.276
That's what that place is about,
the expenses.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.611
Without expenses, I can't launder.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.282
And ifI can't launder,
my boss gets pissed off. Understand?

06:56.910 --> 07:00.243
Now the whole fucking site's on lockdown
for an arson investigation.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.571
We didn't burn down your church.
Mason did.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.206
- Thanks again, Jacob.
- Pleasure, Tim.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.949
Mason burned it down?

07:08.670 --> 07:10.626
It was a gesture, Martin.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.099
Some people understand
the importance of gestures.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.677
You didn't convince Mason of shit. We did.

07:19.390 --> 07:22.439
Fact, all you did was tell him
about our operation.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.069
A fact which, quite frankly,
makes us question your intelligence.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.654
You gave us distribution,
but you stole our anonymity.

07:33.740 --> 07:37.528
So you wanna know what we did?
We stole yours.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.655
Told Mason all about you.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.109
And by the looks of those ashes,

07:42.210 --> 07:46.203
the good pastor wants nothing to do
with your dirty money.

07:48.210 --> 07:51.759
Be grateful it was only your church
that went up in flames.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.981
Why is there a Mexican
sitting on your house?

08:18.370 --> 08:19.325
Agent Evans.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.189
I remember.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.956
Last chance for witness protection.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.070
Excuse me?

08:26.170 --> 08:27.990
We're moving on your husband, Wendy.

08:28.460 --> 08:29.870
With or without you.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.757
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.001
The wave's about to crash on him.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.637
I'm throwing you a life raft.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.419
Take it.

08:42.770 --> 08:46.012
Maybe I'll go introduce myself
to that Mexican man.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.728
Oh, you know, I really don't think
that'd be in your best interest.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.930
-Mine?
-'Cause you see,

08:51.030 --> 08:56.229
if we are who you say we are,
and that man is who you suspect he is,

08:56.320 --> 08:58.868
then you alerting him to your identity
as an FBI agent

08:58.950 --> 09:01.487
only serves to have my family killed.

09:01.580 --> 09:02.945
You'd lose your alleged witnesses,

09:03.040 --> 09:05.452
who you so desperately need
for whatever it is you're after.

09:05.540 --> 09:09.124
And, you know, I bet that's why
you tracked me down here at work...

09:09.670 --> 09:11.956
instead of approaching me at home,
within his view.

09:15.090 --> 09:16.546
You have a very good day.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.236
Looks good, right?

09:37.320 --> 09:38.230
Morning.

09:40.410 --> 09:41.946
You know, I been thinking.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.704
There's a lot of good fishing spots
in this country.

09:47.870 --> 09:50.589
Towns a lot better than this one.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.955
Rivers that really run.

09:54.050 --> 09:56.416
-Cleaner lakes, in places that are--
-Hey, Russ.

09:56.510 --> 09:59.547
Places that... me and you could...

09:59.640 --> 10:02.757
That we could be.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.306
There's this spot in Oregon.

10:06.390 --> 10:08.130
I'm sure we could get an investor and--

10:08.230 --> 10:09.845
Russ, stop.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.350
I need you to hear something.

10:15.570 --> 10:19.483
Promise me that you won't try
to kill Martin Byrde again.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.691
--I need the words.

10:24.410 --> 10:26.651
-Why is--
-Just listen.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.321
I won't try to kill
Marty Byrde again.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.875
What is that?

10:38.720 --> 10:40.426
Well, it amounts to a confession.

10:43.850 --> 10:45.169
No, but why do you have it?

10:52.900 --> 10:54.356
I'm an FBI agent.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.391
And I have you
on conspiracy to commit murder.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.936
What the fuck?

11:39.030 --> 11:41.396
Class B felony in Missouri
is five to 15 years--

11:41.490 --> 11:42.809
Fuck you talking about?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.446
I don't want you to serve that.

11:44.530 --> 11:47.829
I've got a way you don't have to.
I need Martin Byrde.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.159
What?

11:54.880 --> 11:58.293
You help me get him,
and they will cut you a deal.

12:02.170 --> 12:04.889
You understand what's happening right now?

12:15.020 --> 12:16.226
Russ.

12:18.690 --> 12:21.102
-I don't know shit about Byrde.
-Ruth does.

12:21.900 --> 12:25.358
Get something on Ruth that'll force her
to turn State's against him.

12:25.450 --> 12:27.111
You've already got her for the dock.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.906
-I didn't see her rig it.
-You saw it rigged.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.446
-It's not the same.
-But she did it.

12:30.540 --> 12:33.327
- She told me she did it.
- That's hearsay.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.911
Without real evidence,
I need a confession.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.831
I can't breathe.

12:41.590 --> 12:43.581
-Here. Here, here, here.
-I can't fucking breathe.

12:44.470 --> 12:45.505
Just drink some water.

12:46.470 --> 12:48.210
Fuck you, you faggot fuck!

12:50.560 --> 12:52.380
-You fucking turned me!
-I...

12:52.470 --> 12:54.051
You fucking turned me!

13:00.980 --> 13:03.107
Get the fuck off me!

13:03.530 --> 13:05.066
- Stay down!

13:05.570 --> 13:08.562
You think I just happened to be
right next to you

13:08.660 --> 13:11.037
when I needed somebody who knew the lake?
Huh?

13:11.910 --> 13:12.990
I found you.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.611
'07, Jeff City.

13:15.710 --> 13:19.089
You were arrested for picking up
a 19-year-old male prostitute.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.240
So, no. No, I did not fucking turn you.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.870
Now you work with me...

13:25.470 --> 13:27.210
or everyone's gonna know about it.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.597
Now I'm gonna get up.

13:33.810 --> 13:37.302
And when I do, I advise you to remember
you're dealing with a federal agent.

13:58.330 --> 13:59.376
Sign them.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.666
Permission to bug your trailer.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.011
A garbage truck?

14:17.060 --> 14:21.053
Yeah. She was taking the open house sign
to the front of the yard.

14:21.150 --> 14:22.435
Oh, my God.

14:24.110 --> 14:26.522
-It's my fault. I picked a fight.
-No.

14:26.610 --> 14:28.066
Well, I did.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.197
It is, 'cause I was telling her
about you and Marty,

14:32.280 --> 14:35.033
and how you two are married, and...

14:35.120 --> 14:37.190
just to mess with her and...

14:37.290 --> 14:38.575
...she was being mean.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.576
And childish. It was...

14:42.250 --> 14:44.548
-so stupid.
-Oh, Sam.

14:46.340 --> 14:47.830
And I fired her.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.257
-You ﬁred...
-Yeah.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.920
Do not blame yourself.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.013
I'm never gonna be able to take out
the garbage without thinking about her.

15:10.490 --> 15:12.697
Sam, should you go home?

15:12.780 --> 15:15.192
I mean, I can...
I can cover things here.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.319
Yeah.

15:18.870 --> 15:19.859
Yeah, okay.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.609
Are you hungry? Have you eaten today?

15:21.710 --> 15:24.338
I can... I can go pick something.
I can bring it by.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.162
Those cheese hash browns
from the Pancake House.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.877
-You love those.
-Uh...

15:29.550 --> 15:33.134
No, there actually...
There's something, though, you could do.

15:33.220 --> 15:34.289
Anything.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.807
I'm gonna need
some of that money back from Marty.

15:40.270 --> 15:43.728
Oh, I'm... I'm not sure that's advisable.
Just financially, it's...

15:44.520 --> 15:50.026
I mean, well, my mom
had a lot of requests for her funeral.

15:51.070 --> 15:52.560
Those are gonna add up.

15:55.370 --> 15:58.407
Of course. _
I'll... I'll talk to Marty tonight.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.707
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.537
You just let me back in
until the end of the week.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.757
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.924
Look, true or false? You have no idea
what it is that I do or who I do it for.

16:14.010 --> 16:15.079
-That is not the point.
-Right?

16:15.180 --> 16:17.842
You've never helped me and I will
make sure you never would help me.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.637
You never signed anything.
You never even handed me a goddamn pen.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.051
Which means there will be nothing

16:22.140 --> 16:25.439
to implicate you
in whatever it is that I do, okay?

16:25.520 --> 16:27.181
- Jesus, Marty.
- Even so,

16:27.270 --> 16:30.478
I know that if the authorities caught me,
if they busted me,

16:30.570 --> 16:32.697
they would try everything
to link you to me, right?

16:32.780 --> 16:35.522
And it would be difficult for you
to prove that you didn't conspire.

16:35.610 --> 16:39.535
Unless, of course, I made it very easy
for you to prove your innocence.

16:39.620 --> 16:40.735
-What are you doing?
-Your iPhone?

16:40.830 --> 16:43.287
-Give me my phone.
-Hold on. One second. This is almost over.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.205
Rachel...

16:46.170 --> 16:48.491
you let me back into the Blue Cat
to ﬁnish my business,

16:48.590 --> 16:49.625
or I'm gonna come for you.

16:51.420 --> 16:54.082
You understand what I'm saying?
I will kill you.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.080
I will throw your body in the lake

16:56.180 --> 16:58.967
and no one will find you.
No one will know.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.227
Okay. I get caught,
that's all you'll need.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.310
Come on.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.481
I miss this deadline,
the whole family dies.

17:19.490 --> 17:20.900
Just till the end of the week.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.207
-And that's it?
-Yeah.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.249
Hey.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.250
Bury the hatchet?

18:13.750 --> 18:16.218
Thanks for not telling your dad
about the other day.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.507
Guess I was jealous.

18:20.890 --> 18:21.879
Why?

18:24.180 --> 18:26.091
You've been getting so close
to Byrde lately,

18:26.180 --> 18:29.229
it seems like you're more interested
in laundering for the Mexicans

18:29.310 --> 18:30.720
than helping your kin.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.522
I told you that wasn't the case.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.356
You still want to kill him?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.412
Jesus, Russ.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.208
-Can't you talk about anything else?
-I'm... I'm just saying.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.871
You tried once. It didn't work.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.336
You gonna try again?

18:59.430 --> 19:00.966
I have shit to fold.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.271
You fucking happy?
I did what you asked.

19:21.780 --> 19:22.769
Who the fuck is this?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.731
Russ, this is Agent Evans, your handler.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.151
He'll be taking over all FBI interaction
from here on out.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.911
-Handler?
-You can reach me at this number.

19:32.710 --> 19:34.666
What the fuck you talking about?

19:34.750 --> 19:37.298
I'm done. I did it.
You heard Ruth. She admitted it.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.336
Actually, you talked
and she pretty much listened.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.923
Nothing she said today
was explicitly incriminating.

19:43.890 --> 19:47.553
We need specifics. Her plan to kill Marty,
her role in the laundering process.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.709
I'm not talking to you.

19:48.810 --> 19:50.550
You're only talking to him from now on.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.130
Man, fuck you!

19:55.690 --> 19:56.975
Go back.

19:57.860 --> 19:58.929
Do it again.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.373
Jesus, fuck. You idiot.

20:18.710 --> 20:19.540
What?

20:20.300 --> 20:21.710
Tell me you didn't.

20:23.470 --> 20:24.676
I got it done.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.215
You're a fucking animal.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.902
I don't trust her. I don't trust Rachel.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.649
We're gonna have to.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.992
If Evans gets to her, she'll fold.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.117
Look, if I don't transfer the last
of the $8 million today,

20:56.210 --> 20:58.622
we're all gonna be swinging
from a bridge, all right?

20:58.710 --> 21:00.587
And that's including the money

21:00.670 --> 21:03.252
that I already cleaned out
of Eugenia's account.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.581
God knows what happens
if Sam keeps asking for it.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.716
-Jus_t roll it forward.
-I got It. I know. I got it.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.849
So, once the crew finishes
with the air ducts,

21:10.930 --> 21:13.637
they're gonna lay the new carpet,
they'll replace the kitchenettes,

21:13.730 --> 21:16.346
then we'll be out of Rachel's hair.
Don't have to worry about it.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.476
No, we're gonna need this place
when Del sends more.

21:20.270 --> 21:21.726
We'll find new businesses.

21:21.820 --> 21:24.448
Jesus fucking Christ. It just never ends.

21:27.860 --> 21:29.111
Don't know what you want me to say.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.940
I'm worried about the $8 million today.

21:31.030 --> 21:33.612
I haven't gone on to worry
about the fact that

21:33.700 --> 21:35.952
the prize for saving our fucking lives

21:36.040 --> 21:38.201
is just to do it all over again,
only ten times bigger.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.336
Do you wanna talk about our fight?

21:41.630 --> 21:43.621
Nope. You do, though, huh?

21:44.260 --> 21:45.079
No.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.968
I said everything I need to say.
I just wonder if you heard me.

21:49.050 --> 21:50.347
I heard you.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.767
-Did you hear me?
-Yes, actually.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.549
Good.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.471
If we weren't stuck,
would we still be together?

22:15.540 --> 22:16.575
I don't know.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.416
Thank you for not taking that FBI deal.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.587
Honestly... Please.

22:27.670 --> 22:28.671
Hey, Wendy?

22:28.760 --> 22:31.081
-I mean, what the fuck do they have on us?
-Oh, shit.

22:32.430 --> 22:33.715
Sam.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.130
Well, that's all we need.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.686
Hey, Wendy?

22:43.980 --> 22:45.971
-Sam, hi.
-Hey.

22:47.030 --> 22:49.351
-So, I just-- Hey, Marty.
-Hey, Sam. Hi, buddy.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.315
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry to bother you but, uh,

22:51.410 --> 22:55.323
I did a little more thinking last night
about my mother's funeral request

22:55.410 --> 22:58.288
and I definitely think
I'm gonna need that money.

22:58.370 --> 23:01.624
Buddy, I'm really, really sorry
to hear about Eugenia.

23:01.710 --> 23:04.122
-Your mother was a real fine woman.
-Thank you.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.746
Yeah. Listen, uh...

23:06.760 --> 23:08.296
we understand that you...

23:08.380 --> 23:10.678
...you want to give her
the kind of send-off she deserves,

23:10.760 --> 23:13.502
but, you know,
as your new financial planner,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.170
I got... I gotta advise you that...

23:15.260 --> 23:19.344
that oftentimes there are penalties
for early withdrawal of funds

23:19.440 --> 23:21.305
and it can get very, very expensive.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.763
Right, but I've got to do it,
though, so, I mean...

23:25.860 --> 23:28.101
You know, and also the market took
a big dip last week.

23:28.190 --> 23:29.396
I don't know if you knew that.

23:29.490 --> 23:30.855
-Um, Ijust...
-Okay.

23:30.950 --> 23:33.236
Any way you can pay for the funeral
with other savings?

23:34.240 --> 23:37.732
Well, it's really not any of your business
how I pay for the funeral, Marty.

23:37.830 --> 23:40.151
No, no, I know. I know. Um...

23:40.250 --> 23:41.490
I mean, my mother's gone.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.320
Yeah. No, I get it.
I just think it's not--

23:43.420 --> 23:46.958
Okay, so just give me my fucking money.
Please.

23:47.550 --> 23:50.007
Oh, Sam. Sam, we're just trying to help.

23:50.090 --> 23:51.967
Look, do I... Do I have to get a lawyer?

23:52.050 --> 23:54.757
- No, no, no. Listen. Let's... Sorry.
- Let's back up here.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.250
-I mean, it's my mother. So, I don't...
-I understand.

23:57.350 --> 23:58.465
So, I mean, I don't...

23:58.560 --> 24:01.131
I don't care if the penalties
are gonna be 50 fucking percent.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.265
I got an idea.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.767
How about we cover the cost
of the funeral?

24:07.270 --> 24:08.646
No interest loan.

24:08.730 --> 24:11.608
You can pay us back out of the fund
after we're done with the penalty phase.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.770
That way you don't lose
any additional money.

24:13.860 --> 24:15.771
-It's a great idea.
-Yeah.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.077
-So... So, you'll pay for it?
-Absolutely.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.287
This is an awful time for you.
I can't imagine.

24:20.370 --> 24:23.498
I don't want to make it worse
by you losrng money and...

24:23.580 --> 24:24.660
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.240
Let us do this. We want to help.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.872
Wow, that's, uh... Look, I'm...

24:29.960 --> 24:32.963
- I'm sorry for showing up like...
- Oh, please.

24:35.590 --> 24:38.388
Wendy can go with you to the funeral home
and help with the billing.

24:38.470 --> 24:41.132
-What do you think? I got this.
-Yeah, sure.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.804
I need to go clean up
a little bit, but, uh, I'll go.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.721
-Okay. Yeah, sure.
-This is better.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.977
-Cool. Well, I'll be in the car.
-Okay.

24:52.070 --> 24:54.140
-Thanks. Really appreciate it.
-Yep.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.577
-How we gonna pay for this?
-I'll call the bank.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.912
I'll get a credit increase.
Funerals are what? Ten grand?

25:15.970 --> 25:19.098
I'm... I'm sorry,
what is it she wants?

25:19.180 --> 25:22.638
It's extreme embalming.
Uh, it started in Puerto Rico.

25:23.270 --> 25:27.479
It's a celebration of their life,
a way to show them at their best.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.437
Mom saw it on Good Morning America.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.187
-$12,000?
-Yeah.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.850
I understand she staged homes
for a living.

25:38.410 --> 25:39.445
Loved it.

25:39.950 --> 25:41.941
Well, if you would like her
hanging a piece of art,

25:42.040 --> 25:44.076
that would be quite beautiful, I think.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.537
- Oh.
- There would be an extra charge, though.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.621
-And why is that?
-Oh.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.667
My engineers would have to figure out

25:51.750 --> 25:55.334
how to suspend the painting in a way
that won't topple the corpse.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.047
Probably a ceiling mount.

25:58.470 --> 25:59.960
Oh, yeah. That'll do it.

26:00.970 --> 26:03.382
I also worked up a rough estimate
of the other items

26:03.470 --> 26:05.222
we spoke about on the phone.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.058
The full buffet.
Did you decide on a head count?

26:09.770 --> 26:12.568
-Between 100 and 150.
-That many?

26:13.230 --> 26:16.643
Yacht club, bridge club, Rotary.

26:16.740 --> 26:19.197
Hundred and ﬁfty, to be safe.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.157
Sam, this is a lot.

26:21.870 --> 26:25.249
Well, she always swore that she'd throw
a funeral better than her wedding.

26:25.790 --> 26:27.701
Stick it to my father.

26:28.330 --> 26:29.490
So Mom, isn't it?

26:31.460 --> 26:38.218
Our compression services for the carat
she requested runs $19,900, pre-tax.

26:38.300 --> 26:41.383
And I brought some of these diamonds here
to show you.

26:41.470 --> 26:45.554
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm a little behind here. What are these?

26:46.680 --> 26:50.093
Compression preserves our loved ones
and keeps them with us.

26:50.190 --> 26:51.680
We cremate the body,

26:51.770 --> 26:56.389
then use heat compression to convert
the ashes into a diamond like these.

26:56.990 --> 27:01.154
Yeah, Mom wanted me to have it in case
I met somebody and decide to propose.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.650
Hmm.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.366
-Hey, Sam?
-Yeah?

27:04.450 --> 27:08.363
Will you excuse us for a minute and just
let me talk to Harry here about pricing?

27:10.330 --> 27:12.571
-Yeah, sure. Okay.
-Okay.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.290
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

27:21.050 --> 27:22.711
--Harry...

27:23.890 --> 27:26.802
it_ seems to_me _that
some of this prlcmg just Isn't accurate.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.208
It is.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.393
Well, but surely there's some room
for negotiation?

27:32.480 --> 27:33.515
Not really.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.145
What's the total?

27:38.740 --> 27:44.019
Pre-tax, it's $49,950 with the headstone.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.327
What do you need a headstone for?
She's a ring.

27:47.660 --> 27:48.820
Visitation.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.990
Visitation.

27:52.710 --> 27:53.916
Of course.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.330
Of course.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.296
Hey, Harry?

28:02.470 --> 28:05.428
-Do you have a business partner?
-Just me.

28:05.510 --> 28:07.216
God, that's gotta be hard.

28:08.510 --> 28:12.094
'Cause I was noticing that your...
your roof needs to be replaced.

28:12.190 --> 28:15.808
And the... the floor in the lobby
and the wooden banister need reﬁnishing.

28:15.900 --> 28:19.643
And you know, it was amazing
how, when we called,

28:19.740 --> 28:21.605
you were able to see us immediately.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.601
You didn't have any appointments
to reschedule.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.520
You don't even have a receptionist.

28:26.070 --> 28:27.822
Now, maybe that's because
you don't need one,

28:27.910 --> 28:29.741
but I suspect it's because...

28:32.870 --> 28:34.531
you can't afford one.

28:36.670 --> 28:38.331
You're struggling.

28:39.630 --> 28:43.373
And it seems to me...
you're trying to solve that problem

28:43.470 --> 28:46.712
by upselling and overcharging
a man in grief...

28:48.220 --> 28:49.676
who is my friend.

28:54.730 --> 28:55.719
So...

28:58.820 --> 29:00.606
what ifI had an alternate solution?

29:04.530 --> 29:07.693
- Yes! I told you.
- Come on!

29:12.580 --> 29:15.572
Hey. There's no hit man out front.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.451
I transferred the last of the eight.

29:22.550 --> 29:24.871
-We're done?
-For now.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.580
- Yeah.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.501
- We did it.

29:32.890 --> 29:34.346
I want one of those.

29:34.980 --> 29:36.186
Wendy.

29:51.580 --> 29:52.786
Cheers.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.700
How'd that Sam thing go?

30:03.800 --> 30:05.836
We own a funeral home now.

30:13.510 --> 30:14.920
Of course we do.

30:16.730 --> 30:17.799
Gotta kill those fuckers.

30:17.890 --> 30:19.437
- I know. _
- What are you dorng?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.226
-This controller's shit.
-You're shit.

30:21.310 --> 30:23.016
- You're shit.
- 'Sup?

30:23.110 --> 30:25.317
So embarrassing.

30:25.860 --> 30:27.896
My go. Ruth, you and me?

30:27.990 --> 30:31.403
- Wyatt, you guys and Boyd go...

30:31.490 --> 30:33.401
...down to the Steak 'n Shake
and get some dinner.

30:33.490 --> 30:34.900
- All right.
- Whoo!

30:36.250 --> 30:38.787
-You want a triple?
-Uh, yeah. I'll take a triple.

30:39.580 --> 30:41.320
Chili cheese fries.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.832
You know that Dumpster in the back...

30:43.920 --> 30:47.469
Ruth... wait a second.

30:51.970 --> 30:54.052
Look, I need to know
what the plan is with Byrde.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.595
Dude, what's your deal?

30:55.680 --> 30:59.389
My deal is I wanna stop wiping
other people's asses, finally.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.517
And Wyatt, Wy's smart, you know.
He could go to college.

31:03.610 --> 31:05.350
You want him saddled with that debt?

31:05.440 --> 31:07.817
You know, you barely care
if he goes to high school.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.152
He can miss a few days
with that brain of his.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.198
If you want that cash so bad, you do it.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.363
But you... you were the one
who learned to clean it.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.031
That was the whole plan.

31:20.370 --> 31:21.871
-Get outta my way.
-No.

31:24.420 --> 31:26.957
Just say you'll try it again.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.199
You're acting fucking weird.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.757
Just want_ to make sure
you're holding up your end.

31:31.430 --> 31:33.546
Kill Marty Byrde and get his money.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.317
I never wanted to kill Marty Byrde.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.770
That was your idea.

31:58.870 --> 32:03.364
And, frankly, I don't know
why you want to kill him so badly.

32:03.460 --> 32:07.954
He's a good guy and a great businessman.

32:08.750 --> 32:11.833
And since I'd very much like
to keep my job,

32:11.930 --> 32:14.831
how about you kindly
get the fuck out of my way?

32:44.870 --> 32:46.622
- What?
- She's onto you.

32:46.710 --> 32:49.873
No, she's not. She's just a...
She's just a bitch.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.337
Fucking plays head games
with everyone about everything.

32:52.970 --> 32:56.007
Doesn't mean shit. I... I can do this.

33:04.850 --> 33:08.058
Try again, but don't push so damn hard.
You'll blow it.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.026
Can I talk to you, Boyd?

33:15.110 --> 33:16.987
-Thought you wanted food.
-They can go alone.

33:17.070 --> 33:19.322
Wyatt, take my truck. Keys are in it.

33:19.410 --> 33:20.729
Get over here, Boyd.

33:21.540 --> 33:24.361
-Where the fuck we going?
-Shut up and get over here.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.201
Oh, God...

33:36.880 --> 33:38.290
I'm killing him tomorrow.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.755
What?

33:40.850 --> 33:42.590
Marty. Gonna get his money.

33:43.970 --> 33:46.188
-The fuck you talking about?
-I'm leaving town.

33:46.270 --> 33:47.589
I'll get you your half, okay?

33:47.690 --> 33:50.432
Leaving? Wait, I thought
Ruth was taking care of him.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.318
No, Ruth ain't doing shit.
She's fucking stalling.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.230
Russ, what's going on?

34:00.030 --> 34:03.193
Why are we standing out here
in the woods right now?

34:07.370 --> 34:08.701
I fucked up.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.911
There's feds. They're in town.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.706
-Feds?
-FBI.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.542
-Somehow been watching me. They got me.
-What are you talking about?

34:17.630 --> 34:20.042
They got me on conspiracy to...
to murder Byrde.

34:20.140 --> 34:21.789
-What the... How the fuck?
-Yeah. Yeah.

34:21.890 --> 34:24.962
They had somebody...
They had somebody undercover.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.220
That fisherman?

34:36.610 --> 34:39.352
They'd cut me loose
ifI could help them get Ruth.

34:39.450 --> 34:41.111
-Ruth?
-Yeah.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.191
I mean, they really want Byrde, but...

34:43.280 --> 34:46.443
Or Byrde's boss,
or his boss' boss...

34:46.540 --> 34:48.076
I don't fucking know.

34:48.870 --> 34:50.417
But first, Ruth.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.240
And then they get her to do

34:52.340 --> 34:54.240
what they're doing with me,
except with Marty.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.332
-They'd cut her a deal?
-If she helped 'em.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.171
-Well, then do it.
-No. It--

35:00.260 --> 35:03.673
-You gotta do it, Russ. Yes!
-It... No. No, I can't-- No, she knows.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.091
She fucking knows.

35:06.770 --> 35:09.386
I tried to get her to incriminate
and she figured it out.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.472
You remember that shit
Cade would do

35:12.560 --> 35:14.357
when he knew
you was lying about something?

35:16.070 --> 35:18.026
Stone cold and then all smiles and shit?

35:21.860 --> 35:25.535
She just did that. She knows.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.029
Shit.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.748
I can't get the feds what they want,
they're gonna put me away.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.206
Fifteen years.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.050
I'm gonna kidnap Marty...

35:48.310 --> 35:51.017
get his money and kill him.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.436
With feds in town?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.774
The boys and I will be in Canada
before they know what happened.

36:04.410 --> 36:05.445
I'm coming with you.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.361
-Boyd--
-You're my brother.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.742
What the fuck have I got here, anyway?

36:13.040 --> 36:16.624
Do we really gotta kill him, though?
Can't we just take the money and get?

36:18.210 --> 36:19.256
We can't.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.211
He could tell the Mexicans about us.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.092
Besides, they're gonna kill him anyway.
And worse.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.004
It's mercy to murder him.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.179
Okay.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.269
You got that?

36:44.860 --> 36:48.523
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, Jackie Blue

36:49.740 --> 36:53.198
Lives her life
from inside of her room...

36:54.040 --> 36:56.702
- Delivery for Marty Byrde.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.701
Okay, yeah.
We'll just tie that up in a sec.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.713
-Uh, we're not expecting any delivery.
-He is.

37:04.630 --> 37:05.631
'Course he is.

37:06.550 --> 37:07.596
Is that a problem?

37:07.680 --> 37:09.216
No. I'll just go ahead and sign for it.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.346
No, can't. It's gotta be him.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.301
All right. I will give him a call.
Hey, Jonah?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.607
What time is your dad getting back
from the funeral?

37:19.190 --> 37:21.397
I don't know.
How... How long are funerals, usually?

37:23.650 --> 37:24.480
I'll wait.

37:28.490 --> 37:32.494
I need you to get down here.
There is a delivery for you.

37:52.010 --> 37:52.965
Tuck.

37:53.470 --> 37:54.346
You okay?

37:54.810 --> 37:56.050
I need a favor.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.309
Heading out.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.229
Get over here.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.400
Thought you had
the afternoon shift.

38:13.490 --> 38:16.709
Gotta go to the store first.
Come on over here a sec.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.825
Need to talk to you.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.371
-Something wrong?
-Just get over here.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.580
What's up?

38:27.220 --> 38:28.255
Listen.

38:30.470 --> 38:34.759
_Your uncle and me... _
come Into a busmess opportunity.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.550
Requires us to relocate.

38:38.390 --> 38:41.018
-Business?
-Yes, busmess.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.185
Good business.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.391
It'll pay for your college, you wanna go.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.448
-Get you a four-wheeler, Three.
-Oh, shit.

38:49.530 --> 38:51.942
But you gotta do what I say, okay?

38:52.910 --> 38:54.866
To the letter, so listen.

38:57.290 --> 39:00.168
You put a movie on in the trailer
when you go back in there.

39:01.250 --> 39:04.799
Put it on loud. And you start packing.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.674
Just a few things,
shit you can't live without.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.460
Leave the fucking Xbox.
We'll get you another one.

39:13.350 --> 39:17.389
And do not open your mouths
when you're in there.

39:17.810 --> 39:20.017
-That's important.
-But what's going on, though?

39:20.100 --> 39:21.977
Is someone listening or something?

39:23.190 --> 39:27.069
After this conversation,
you do not talk about this.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.179
Not with anyone.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.770
Well, what about Ruth?

39:31.860 --> 39:34.021
-Especially not Ruth.
-Why not?

39:34.120 --> 39:35.781
'Cause I said so, Three.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.189
She's coming with us though, right?

39:37.290 --> 39:38.860
Keep your fucking voice down.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.666
-Is she coming with us?
-No!

39:42.540 --> 39:43.746
Well, what the fuck?

39:43.830 --> 39:45.240
She ain't invited, Wy.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.047
-But she's Ruth. Why not?
-'Cause there's shit in this world

39:48.130 --> 39:50.872
-you don't fucking understand!
-Hey, Dad, come on! Calm down.

39:56.510 --> 39:57.807
I'm your father.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.644
We're leaving tonight,
and you're gonna do what I fuckin' say.

40:04.610 --> 40:05.679
Please?

40:28.750 --> 40:29.956
I love these.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.634
Okay, there.
You're set. Have a Superstore day.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.886
$67.93.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.126
What are you doing?

43:12.960 --> 43:14.587
-We can't talk in there.
-Why the hell not?

43:14.670 --> 43:16.752
-Dad said.
-Said what?

43:17.380 --> 43:19.007
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.711
Wyatt, what the fuck's going on?

43:23.550 --> 43:27.179
Dad and Boyd got into some business thing
and we're leaving town.

43:27.270 --> 43:28.476
What thing?

43:29.350 --> 43:32.513
I don't know. I'm guessing
not actual business. They took the guns.

43:37.570 --> 43:38.776
When are they splitting?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.235
Tonight.

43:43.740 --> 43:45.150
And you're going with them?

43:46.950 --> 43:48.941
He's my dad.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.918
I'll let you know where we are
when we settle.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.239
I gotta get back inside.

44:02.760 --> 44:05.172
- You're finally getting out, huh?

44:59.690 --> 45:00.896
Oh, my God.

45:02.740 --> 45:05.356
-How much?
-Fifty mil.

45:24.340 --> 45:25.921
How'd it get here so fast?

45:26.590 --> 45:28.546
Roller skates. What the fuck do you think?

45:29.140 --> 45:30.755
Just drove it down from Chicago.

45:31.310 --> 45:34.052
-It's not wrapped.
-So wrap it.

45:34.940 --> 45:35.929
Fifty million?

45:36.480 --> 45:38.471
You're a smart man, Marty.
You'll figure it out.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.608
But I'm gonna stick around,
make sure it's safe.

45:44.690 --> 45:47.523
Um, okay. Well, we can't do it
dressed like this.

45:47.610 --> 45:52.070
We'll be back in an hour, okay?
Can you pull this up to that corner cabin?

45:52.160 --> 45:53.366
See you in a bit.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.990
You're gonna hide it here?

45:58.080 --> 46:00.878
Well, I can't use the storage facility.
The Snells know about it.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.120
But what about Rachel?

46:02.210 --> 46:03.837
I don't have time to fuck around, Wendy.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.626
Not with feds in town. _
We already have to wrap It.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.881
Skip wrapping it.
Just get it out of sight.

46:07.970 --> 46:10.962
No, I can't just stack bills in a wall
and call it a day.

46:11.060 --> 46:13.676
There's rot, and there's termites,
there's rats.

46:13.770 --> 46:16.887
First year I did this,
Bruce lost 300K in two days to squirrels.

46:18.100 --> 46:21.149
But it's gonna take us days
with just the two of us.

46:21.230 --> 46:22.811
That's why we're gonna need more hands.

46:28.070 --> 46:29.150
No.

46:35.870 --> 46:38.361
Couldn't spare a couple bucks
for psoriasis, huh?

46:38.460 --> 46:41.497
- It's not our money.
- Yeah. And it's not a disease.

46:41.590 --> 46:45.082
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. One more box to go.

46:46.300 --> 46:47.415
I'm starving.

46:48.010 --> 46:51.594
Yeah, you know, you two are breaking,
like, ten child labor laws right now.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.307
All right. Let me hammer this piece in.

46:53.390 --> 46:55.802
I'll go see what Rachel's
got in the kitchen, okay?

46:55.890 --> 46:57.016
All right.

49:02.770 --> 49:04.010
Russ?

49:05.690 --> 49:06.645
Russ!

49:18.280 --> 49:19.941
What the fuck was that?

49:20.490 --> 49:22.242
It's probably the transformer.

49:23.500 --> 49:26.572
Okay, good. The generators came on.
Honey, I'm gonna go check it out.

49:26.670 --> 49:27.705
Okay.

49:36.050 --> 49:37.881
Hey, are you all right?
What the hell was that?

49:37.970 --> 49:40.382
Something must have chewed
through that wire.

49:40.470 --> 49:42.461
- You smell that?

49:45.560 --> 49:47.016
What the fuck is that?

50:09.080 --> 50:10.240
Oh, my God.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.336
Oh, fuck!

50:13.000 --> 50:14.160
You know them?

50:15.670 --> 50:18.047
That's Russ and Boyd Langmore.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.387
Why the fuck they got guns
and a grab bag, Marty?

50:23.600 --> 50:25.921
- Did you do this?
- What?

50:26.940 --> 50:28.760
Somebody fucked with all the wiring.

50:29.650 --> 50:32.938
- What are you talking about?
- It's been rigged.

50:34.190 --> 50:37.523
- Rigged?
- Yeah, right there. It's rigged.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.033
Did you do this? You knew that they were
coming after you.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.532
'Cause somebody fucking did this
on purpose, Marty.

51:04.220 --> 51:07.553
Okay. Get out of here, both of y'all.
I'm calling the cops.

51:08.140 --> 51:09.971
Hey, put the phone away.

51:10.060 --> 51:11.049
You hear me?

51:11.150 --> 51:12.435
-Put the fucking phone away!
-Whoa!

51:12.520 --> 51:14.067
-Take it easy.
-Marty, is this one a problem?

51:14.150 --> 51:17.483
She's only a problem if you kill her.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

51:17.570 --> 51:19.231
She should call the cops.

51:19.320 --> 51:22.369
She would, okay? Electrocutions happen
on this lake all the time, okay?

51:22.450 --> 51:25.578
It's, like, four already this year.
This is not a problem.

51:25.660 --> 51:27.787
We just get rid of the grab bag
and the guns,

51:27.870 --> 51:29.861
and you call the police.
You say it was an accident.

51:29.960 --> 51:32.747
A boat came in a little bit too hot
and cut the wires.

51:32.830 --> 51:35.663
They fell in the water.
It's very, very easily explained, right?

51:35.750 --> 51:38.583
You kill her, and she disappears,
you can't explain that.

51:39.670 --> 51:41.001
Okay? And don't worry about her.

51:41.090 --> 51:42.967
She knows how to mind her business, right?

51:43.720 --> 51:45.039
-Rig ht?
-Yeah.

51:47.680 --> 51:51.309
Get the fuck out of here, Marty.
You weren't here tonight.

51:52.350 --> 51:54.261
Let's see if you do know
how to mind your own business.

51:54.860 --> 51:56.771
I'm gonna play witness
when you talk to the cops.

51:56.860 --> 51:58.145
Make sure you get the facts right.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.480
She'll be fine.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.151
-You'll be okay. Right?
-Yeah.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.650
-Go.
-Yeah.

52:10.710 --> 52:12.029
Yeah, Del.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.626
There's been some drama.

52:17.630 --> 52:19.837
I will call you
when I get more information.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.717
Okay. Bye.

52:25.390 --> 52:27.881
Yeah, I'd like to report
an accident, please.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.010
Okay.
You guys go brush your teeth.

52:36.110 --> 52:38.396
-Get right to bed, please.
-We'll be right in.

52:45.570 --> 52:46.776
They almost...

52:47.700 --> 52:49.907
-They could have...
-But they didn't.

52:49.990 --> 52:52.072
-The kids were with us.
-I know.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.819
Who could have rigged that dock?

53:16.190 --> 53:17.600
Did it work?

53:22.740 --> 53:23.855
Yeah.

53:27.780 --> 53:30.783
What if Rachel had gone for a boat ride?

53:33.620 --> 53:35.201
The boats are in storage.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.292
What if Charlotte had gone for a swim?

53:44.720 --> 53:46.210
It's too cold to swim.

53:55.850 --> 53:57.590
Those are your uncles.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.480
I couldn't have them kill you.

54:31.720 --> 54:33.631
What'd the sheriff say?

54:33.720 --> 54:35.517
He's ruling it an accident.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.477
She did this. You know that.

54:37.560 --> 54:38.970
Can you take your call outside?

54:39.060 --> 54:41.551
-It's exactly how she went after Marty.
-The game's on.

54:41.650 --> 54:43.140
Man, fuck your game.

54:43.230 --> 54:45.027
- Excuse me?
- Rob.

54:45.690 --> 54:47.317
Hey, calm down.

54:48.660 --> 54:52.528
-Pick her up.
-On what? It was an accident.

54:52.620 --> 54:54.440
Hmm. Bullshit.

54:54.540 --> 54:56.952
You know what?
You better hope it was, Roy.

54:58.250 --> 55:01.037
Because if she did do this, that's on you.

55:04.800 --> 55:07.121
She was onto Russ the other day,
and you know that,

55:07.220 --> 55:10.838
and you gave him another shot
because your dick wanted it that way.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.680
Finally.

55:26.940 --> 55:28.237
That's a bad idea.

55:37.950 --> 55:42.319
Hold the line
I have heard it once before

55:46.050 --> 55:49.918
Please, please, woman
I'll be home at 2:00

55:54.550 --> 55:59.305
I drip, drip bourbon
On top of your chest, ah

56:03.270 --> 56:07.889
Itiptoe, honey
On the top of the roof, ah

56:11.410 --> 56:15.369
When we make love
You know I'm leaving

56:15.870 --> 56:19.362
When we make love
I know you're hurting

56:21.080 --> 56:24.789
Now, I'm craving

56:25.290 --> 56:30.159
Everything I see

56:30.260 --> 56:34.082
- I've waited years for you
- Count lucky stars

56:34.180 --> 56:36.557
Never really hurts me

56:37.260 --> 56:38.466
Count lucky stars

56:38.560 --> 56:42.803
I tiptoe in the world I'm searching

56:42.890 --> 56:46.849
I'll breathe fire into your mind

56:46.940 --> 56:50.728
Dope fiends, that's what we are

56:51.530 --> 56:55.739
Dope fiends, count lucky stars

56:55.820 --> 56:58.869
Oh, and she did it

57:00.240 --> 57:03.459
Oh, and she did it

57:13.380 --> 57:17.544
Now, you're escaping

57:17.930 --> 57:22.845
There's no use for me
