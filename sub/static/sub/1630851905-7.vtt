<i>We're starving.
There's nothing to hunt.</i>

02:50.628 --> 02:52.922
<i>The animals might be migrating.</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:55.508
<i>That's probably why the only

02:55.592 --> 02:57.302

That's not up to you.</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:29.751
<i>Well, you can't just send her
out there with nothing.</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:32.587
This is insane.
We don't know where we are,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.839

<i>Fine.</i>

15:24.840 --> 15:27.343
<i>I took it from Jeff's,
like, "special keeps."</i>

15:27.384 --> 15:30.179
<i>You're not as sentimental
as your hubby?</i>

15:32.389 --> 15:35.017
<i>I'm trying to help you guys.</i>

15:37.227 --> 15:38.938
<i>Is that good?</i>

15:40.105 --> 15:43.317
<i>It's like a needle
in a goddamn haystack.</i>

15:43.359 --> 15:46.153
<i>Can we go now?
I can't wait to meet Fuckface.</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:48.322
<i>Give me the keys.</i>

15:48.405 --> 15:50.366
<i>What? Why?</i>

15:50.407 --> 15:53.911
<i>I got the money.
I'm gonna make the drop.</i>

15:57.623 --> 15:58.874
<i>Nah, it's cool, it's cool.</i>

15:58.958 --> 16:00.542
<i>She's my baby.</i>

16:00.584 --> 16:03.587
<i>All right, meet me one block
east of Carlyle and DeWalt,</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:06.173
<i>-and don't fuck around.</i>

16:12.680 --> 16:15.683
<i>Wait, how do you
fucking start this thing?</i>

16:16.350 --> 16:18.435
<i>[Shauna]</i> <i>Hey. Uh, everyone's
heading down to the lake.</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:20.521
<i>-I'm just gonna go change.
- Nope.</i>

16:20.562 --> 16:23.816
<i>You are finally gonna tell me
what the hell is going on.</i>

16:24.483 --> 16:27.486
<i>What? What are you
talking about?</i>

16:29.113 --> 16:31.407
<i>Jackie, nothing's going on.</i>

16:32.908 --> 16:34.660
<i>Okay.</i>

16:34.743 --> 16:36.036
<i>Liar.</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:37.830
<i>No, no.</i>

16:37.871 --> 16:39.915
<i>You do not get to...</i>

16:39.957 --> 16:43.168
<i>Oh, my God.
Why are these so heavy?</i>

16:43.210 --> 16:46.422
<i>-Are you done?
- No, I'm not done!</i>

16:46.505 --> 16:48.090
<i>You're obviously
hiding something from me,</i>

16:48.173 --> 16:50.843
<i>and it's making me feel crazy.</i>

16:52.094 --> 16:53.846
<i>Remember when your parents
first separated</i>

16:53.887 --> 16:56.306
<i>and you told me the reason
your dad wasn't around as much</i>

16:56.348 --> 16:59.685
<i>was because he got a new job
as the president at Hello Kitty?</i>

16:59.727 --> 17:02.229
<i>That was more convincing
than you're being right now.</i>

17:02.271 --> 17:04.023
<i>Shauna,</i>

17:04.106 --> 17:06.608
<i>I've seen you sneaking around
and whispering with Taissa.</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:08.235
<i>Not to mention you acting all</i>

17:08.318 --> 17:12.197
<i>distant and weird
for weeks, so...</i>

17:12.281 --> 17:14.158
<i>spill.</i>

17:16.160 --> 17:19.204
<i>Are you really gonna keep
something from me out here?</i>

17:20.539 --> 17:22.791
<i>What did I do?</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:26.962
<i>When did you stop wanting me
to be your best friend?</i>

17:34.094 --> 17:35.846
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

17:37.848 --> 17:38.932
<i>What?</i>

17:39.016 --> 17:43.437
<i>Taissa figured it out when
she caught me faking my period.</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:44.980
<i>I mean...</i>

17:46.440 --> 17:49.234
<i>How-how did this happen?</i>

17:51.570 --> 17:53.197
<i>Well, when a man and a woman...</i>

17:53.280 --> 17:56.241
<i>No. I mean...</i>

17:57.743 --> 18:01.830
<i>You lost your virginity
without telling me.</i>

18:01.872 --> 18:03.916
<i>W-With who?</i>

18:06.043 --> 18:08.087
<i>Uh, Randy.</i>

18:09.421 --> 18:11.423
<i>Randy?</i>

18:12.841 --> 18:13.759
<i>Wow.</i>

18:13.801 --> 18:16.804
<i>Uh... Okay.</i>

18:16.887 --> 18:18.889
<i>Virginity.</i>

18:20.724 --> 18:24.103
<i>Randy. Baby.
I have so many questions.</i>

18:24.186 --> 18:26.105
<i>-I mean, how...</i>

18:32.236 --> 18:33.904
<i>Don't worry.</i>

18:33.987 --> 18:37.116
<i>We're gonna get
through this together.</i>

18:42.663 --> 18:45.290
<i>slow, tense music</i>

19:12.943 --> 19:14.611
<i>She tells us
not to take forever.</i>

19:14.653 --> 19:16.488
<i>How long does it take
to drive a block?</i>

19:16.572 --> 19:18.282
<i>Maybe she stopped
to score drugs.</i>

19:18.323 --> 19:20.993
Oh, God. I hope not.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.620
<i>Ah, the pay cut I took
to run for Senate</i>

19:23.662 --> 19:26.206
<i>isn't gonna fund
another stint in rehab.</i>

19:26.290 --> 19:29.501
<i>Fuck, Tai, did you really?</i>

19:29.585 --> 19:30.711
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:30.752 --> 19:32.963
<i>Why?</i>

19:33.005 --> 19:36.967
<i>You're just enabling her
to repeat the same pattern.</i>

19:37.009 --> 19:40.345
<i>She has to learn
to handle her own shit.</i>

19:41.221 --> 19:43.891
<i>And if she never does?</i>

19:45.434 --> 19:47.853
<i>Shauna.</i>

19:47.936 --> 19:50.647
<i>Don't you think about it?</i>

19:50.689 --> 19:53.108
<i>I got Simone, Sammy.</i>

19:53.150 --> 19:56.737
<i>You've got Jeff and-and Callie.</i>

19:56.778 --> 20:00.282
<i>Did we do something
to deserve that?</i>

20:00.324 --> 20:03.994
<i>It's just fate
that gave us that, right?</i>

20:06.246 --> 20:08.916
<i>Who does Natalie have?</i>

20:08.999 --> 20:10.375
<i>Other than Travis,</i>

20:10.417 --> 20:14.004
<i>which we both know
was a fucking train wreck,</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:16.423
<i>who does she really have?</i>

20:17.799 --> 20:20.469
<i>No one.</i>

20:20.552 --> 20:23.555
<i>And now she has less.</i>

20:25.098 --> 20:28.352
<i>We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for her.</i>

20:28.435 --> 20:31.897
<i>So I do what I can.
Not just for her, for me.</i>

20:37.778 --> 20:40.155
<i>What the fuck took you so long?</i>

20:41.281 --> 20:43.492
<i>-I stopped at a gas station.
- Oh.</i>

20:43.575 --> 20:45.869
<i>But I couldn't find any cups.</i>

20:45.953 --> 20:47.454
<i>-What?</i>

20:48.080 --> 20:50.874
<i>Where did you find
a gas station in Jersey</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:52.793
<i>that sells liquor at 2 a.m.?</i>

20:52.876 --> 20:54.628
<i>I bought it off the clerk.</i>

20:54.711 --> 20:57.714
<i>How else do you think they
get through the night shift?</i>

20:57.756 --> 21:00.425
<i>-Did you see anyone at the drop?
- If I saw somebody,</i>

21:00.509 --> 21:02.844
<i>I would've told you, Tai.</i>

21:02.886 --> 21:05.097
<i>Pass that to me.</i>

21:08.225 --> 21:10.644
<i>Come on, Fuckface,
take the money.</i>

21:11.853 --> 21:14.773
<i></i>

21:17.985 --> 21:20.112
<i>Actually, Girl Scouts...</i>

21:20.195 --> 21:22.572
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

21:23.782 --> 21:25.701
<i>Lottie gave it to me.</i>

21:25.784 --> 21:27.911
<i>-Seriously?
- What?</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:29.204
<i>I'm just saying, you know,</i>

21:29.246 --> 21:31.581
<i>if this was a horror movie,
she'd be the villain, right?</i>

21:31.665 --> 21:35.085
<i>If this was a horror movie,
you would be the first to die.</i>

21:35.127 --> 21:36.253
<i>Why, because I'm Black?</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:37.879
<i>No, 'cause you're
the skeptical one.</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:39.089
<i>They always go first,</i>

21:39.172 --> 21:41.466
<i>leaving the rest of us
to keep doing dumb shit and die</i>

21:41.550 --> 21:42.926
<i>in unnecessarily brutal ways.</i>

21:42.968 --> 21:44.511
<i>Mm-hmm.
Wait. Hang on.</i>

21:44.594 --> 21:48.765
<i>Why does the Black character
always die first?</i>

21:49.766 --> 21:51.476
<i>Anyway, for the record,</i>

21:51.560 --> 21:53.854
<i>Lottie predicted prom queen
last year</i>

21:53.937 --> 21:56.898
<i>and the whole
Mr. Jenkins scandal.</i>

21:58.233 --> 22:00.402
<i>What? She did.</i>

22:00.485 --> 22:01.653
<i>Chill out. Oh, my God.</i>

22:01.737 --> 22:04.031
<i>You get so serious
about this shit.</i>

22:06.241 --> 22:10.329
<i>Music of the night...</i>

22:10.370 --> 22:11.955
<i>Misty!</i>

22:11.997 --> 22:14.416
<i>God fucking damn it, Misty!</i>

22:14.458 --> 22:16.585
<i>Surrender to your
darkest dreams...</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:18.837
<i>Hello, Kevyn Tan.</i>

22:20.547 --> 22:23.050
<i>I know you can fucking hear me!</i>

22:23.133 --> 22:25.469
<i>Unfortunately.</i>

22:26.636 --> 22:29.639
<i>Close your eyes,
let your spirit</i>

22:29.723 --> 22:31.641
<i>Start to</i>

22:31.725 --> 22:34.978
<i>Soar</i>

22:36.229 --> 22:37.689
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

22:37.731 --> 22:40.817
<i>Blackmail us, fine,</i>

22:40.901 --> 22:43.403
<i>but it's 3:34.</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:46.073
<i>Like, why have us
show up at 2:00</i>

22:46.114 --> 22:48.700
<i>and then just keep us waiting?
It's, like...</i>

22:50.952 --> 22:54.539
<i>Maybe they're scouring the area,
making sure we're not waiting.</i>

22:54.581 --> 22:56.792
<i>Okay. Then find us already.</i>

22:56.875 --> 22:58.335
<i>I'm not impressed.</i>

22:58.377 --> 22:59.669
<i>Maybe slow down?</i>

22:59.753 --> 23:02.130
<i>Mm. What for?</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:03.465
<i>This is a train wreck already.</i>

23:03.507 --> 23:05.509
<i>Yeah, no, it will be,
at this rate.</i>

23:05.550 --> 23:07.511
<i>All right, you're right.</i>

23:07.594 --> 23:11.098
<i>We should make the most
of this quality time.</i>

23:11.181 --> 23:13.683
<i>Tai, how are the wife and kid?</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:16.478
<i>Fine.</i>

23:16.561 --> 23:19.106
<i>And the campaign?</i>

23:19.147 --> 23:20.607
<i>Hmm.</i>

23:20.649 --> 23:22.359
<i>-It's also fine?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

23:22.401 --> 23:25.112
<i>-It's just fine.
- It's fine.</i>

23:25.153 --> 23:28.990
<i>And what's the, um,
what happened to your hand?</i>

23:29.032 --> 23:29.825
<i>Oh.</i>

23:29.908 --> 23:32.994
<i>Um, nothing. It's just, uh...</i>

23:33.078 --> 23:34.913
<i>It's nothing.</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:37.332
<i>Okay. Okay. Great talk.</i>

23:37.374 --> 23:39.835
<i>Well, if anyone
wants to know about me,</i>

23:39.876 --> 23:42.712
<i>I've been...</i>

23:42.796 --> 23:45.048
<i>fucking Kevyn Tan.</i>

23:45.132 --> 23:46.967
<i>Kevyn Tan?</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:48.802
<i>The goth kid?</i>

23:48.885 --> 23:51.012
<i>Well, he's a cop now.</i>

23:51.096 --> 23:53.223
<i>-Are you're kidding me?
- Uh, yeah.</i>

23:53.265 --> 23:55.600
<i>And he has two kids, and...</i>

23:55.684 --> 23:56.935
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

23:57.018 --> 23:59.438
<i>That sounds a bit complicated.</i>

24:00.480 --> 24:03.191
<i>Not to me. He's, uh...</i>

24:03.233 --> 24:05.569
<i>I mean, he's actually kind of...</i>

24:07.112 --> 24:08.613
<i>...nice.</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:14.661
<i>-I like it. I think it's great.
Yeah.</i>

24:14.744 --> 24:16.913
<i>-Yeah. Wait.</i>

24:16.997 --> 24:18.832
<i>-He's moving. Okay. All right.
- Oh.</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:20.041
<i>-Oh.
- Oh, no, no. no.</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:22.085
<i>Actually, I probably shouldn't
drive 'cause if we die,</i>

24:22.127 --> 24:23.462
<i>we will never find out
who's doing this.</i>

24:23.545 --> 24:25.005
<i>Okay. Get out.</i>

24:25.046 --> 24:25.964
<i>-Switch.
- I'll drive.</i>

24:26.006 --> 24:28.216
<i>No.
No, no.</i>

24:38.268 --> 24:39.644
<i>You hear that?</i>

24:39.728 --> 24:41.938
<i>-I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.</i>

25:00.457 --> 25:02.834
<i>I'm so glad you stayed.</i>

25:07.464 --> 25:09.424
<i>Um... wait.</i>

25:09.508 --> 25:11.301
<i>What if someone, um...</i>

25:11.343 --> 25:13.595
<i>They all went down to the lake.</i>

25:13.678 --> 25:14.721
<i>Except for Coach,</i>

25:14.804 --> 25:17.307
<i>who's outside enjoying
his new life without Misty.</i>

25:17.349 --> 25:20.810
<i>And it's not like we wouldn't
hear him anyway, so...</i>

25:20.852 --> 25:23.146
<i>I think we're good.</i>

25:36.785 --> 25:38.078
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

25:38.161 --> 25:39.329
<i>-Nat, Nat, hey.
- Hmm?</i>

25:39.412 --> 25:42.249
<i>-Did you not like what I was--
- No, no, no.</i>

25:42.332 --> 25:44.834
<i>It's-it's not that.</i>

25:44.876 --> 25:46.878
<i>We should, um...</i>

25:48.672 --> 25:51.007
<i>Wait.</i>

25:59.724 --> 26:02.561
<i>Do you want me to help with...</i>

26:02.644 --> 26:05.355
<i>No, no, uh, it's fine.</i>

26:06.439 --> 26:08.233
<i>You know,
they're kind of tricky.</i>

26:08.316 --> 26:10.193
<i>I got it.</i>

26:33.675 --> 26:36.219
<i>I want you so bad.</i>

26:38.972 --> 26:40.223
<i>Uh...</i>

26:40.265 --> 26:43.393
<i>You-you don't have to...
talk like that.</i>

26:45.729 --> 26:47.731
<i>I'm sorry, I just...</i>

26:48.898 --> 26:50.859
<i>You ready?</i>

27:07.751 --> 27:09.461
<i>Shit.</i>

27:10.837 --> 27:12.672
<i>Should I...</i>

27:12.756 --> 27:14.924
<i>No. It's fine.</i>

27:19.429 --> 27:21.473
<i>Shit.</i>

27:21.514 --> 27:23.475
<i>-Hey, it's okay, Travis.
- I'm sorry.</i>

27:23.558 --> 27:25.060
<i>It's okay.</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:35.028
<i>-Where are you going?
- I-I don't know.</i>

27:35.111 --> 27:37.364
<i>Okay? I...</i>

27:37.447 --> 27:38.573
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

27:38.657 --> 27:40.200
<i>I just...</i>

27:40.241 --> 27:43.495
<i>I got to go. I'm sorry.</i>

27:55.590 --> 27:57.926
<i>So...</i>

27:57.967 --> 28:00.512
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

28:01.429 --> 28:05.308
<i>Was it... good?</i>

28:07.644 --> 28:09.312
<i>I don't know, uh...</i>

28:09.396 --> 28:12.357
<i>It was just this one time.</i>

28:12.440 --> 28:15.110
<i>It hurt a little.</i>

28:15.151 --> 28:17.153
<i>It only lasted,
like, three minutes.</i>

28:17.195 --> 28:19.864
Oh, Randy.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.451
<i>Oh, God, I can picture it now.</i>

28:23.493 --> 28:26.413
<i>-Just... Like, his little butt.</i>

28:26.454 --> 28:28.873
<i>Just, like, right...
just right here.</i>

28:28.915 --> 28:30.542
<i>-Jackie, stop.
- Just moving.</i>

28:30.625 --> 28:32.627
<i>Stop.</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:34.379
<i>When did this happen?</i>

28:34.421 --> 28:36.172
<i>How could I possibly
have missed it?</i>

28:36.214 --> 28:39.134
<i>I have a life
outside of you, you know?</i>

28:43.054 --> 28:46.182
<i>Uh, it was the night
of Mari's birthday party.</i>

28:46.224 --> 28:49.352
<i>You and Jeff
bailed early, remember?</i>

28:49.436 --> 28:51.563
<i>And then I had too much
Malibu and milk...</i>

28:51.604 --> 28:53.565
<i>Oh, I told you
to stop drinking that.</i>

28:53.648 --> 28:55.108
<i>And mostly because
it's disgusting,</i>

28:55.150 --> 28:57.235
<i>not 'cause I thought
it would lead to the conception</i>

28:57.277 --> 28:59.571
<i>of you and Randy Walsh's
love child.</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:02.741
<i>Duly noted.</i>

29:09.205 --> 29:13.418
<i>Are you sure it was the night
of Mari's birthday party?</i>

29:13.501 --> 29:16.004
<i>Uh, 'cause I could've sworn
that was the night</i>

29:16.087 --> 29:18.047
<i>I had to go back
and give Randy a ride home</i>

29:18.089 --> 29:20.717
<i>'cause he puked in the pool.</i>

29:20.800 --> 29:22.469
<i>Uh...</i>

29:22.552 --> 29:23.887
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:23.970 --> 29:26.431
<i>We were both
pretty drunk, I guess.</i>

29:27.557 --> 29:29.601
<i>So much for making it
special, right?</i>

29:32.020 --> 29:34.230
<i>Right.</i>

29:34.272 --> 29:36.357
<i>slow, somber music</i>

29:51.372 --> 29:53.958
<i>Shauna, what are you gonna do?</i>

29:57.212 --> 29:59.130
<i>Honestly?</i>

30:01.549 --> 30:03.635
<i>I have no fucking clue.</i>

30:07.430 --> 30:08.848
<i>So, get this,</i>

30:08.890 --> 30:12.811
<i>after Bill Pullman
falls in love with Sandra,</i>

30:12.894 --> 30:15.814
<i>his fucking brother wakes up.</i>

30:15.855 --> 30:18.399
<i>It's a whole-ass mess. I mean,
this dude actually thinks</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:20.276
<i>that Sandy is his fiancée,</i>

30:20.360 --> 30:22.445
<i>but she's not, so just...</i>

30:33.373 --> 30:36.125
<i>We'll be fine.
Wolves are scared of humans.</i>

30:36.209 --> 30:39.462
<i>Besides, it doesn't sound
like they're very close.</i>

30:43.800 --> 30:46.302
<i>We can take turns keeping watch,
just to be extra safe,</i>

30:46.344 --> 30:49.013
<i>but I really don't think
we have anything to worry about.</i>

30:53.643 --> 30:56.187
<i>You know who does need to worry?</i>

30:56.229 --> 30:58.356
<i>-Our girl Sandy.</i>

30:58.398 --> 31:00.316
<i>Because she does not know
this man,</i>

31:00.358 --> 31:01.734
<i>and he's never seen her before.</i>

31:01.818 --> 31:03.111
<i>He's like, "Who is this girl?"</i>

31:03.152 --> 31:05.196
<i>And his doctor is like,
"Well, you must have amnesia</i>

31:05.238 --> 31:08.032
<i>because you don't remember
your wife-to-be."</i>

31:09.617 --> 31:11.244
<i>Ooh. Be careful.</i>

31:11.327 --> 31:15.039
<i>Uh, maybe we should, uh,
angle it a little bit.</i>

31:15.123 --> 31:16.708
<i>Um...</i>

31:16.749 --> 31:17.959
<i>I think it's wedged.</i>

31:18.001 --> 31:19.502
<i>[Jack]</i> <i>Why don't you step back
for a little bit.</i>

31:19.544 --> 31:20.461
<i>I'm gonna try an old trick.</i>

31:20.503 --> 31:22.046
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

31:22.130 --> 31:24.090
<i>What's-what's the trick?</i>

31:25.884 --> 31:27.051
<i>Well...</i>

31:27.093 --> 31:30.930
<i>I want you to tell me the truth.</i>

31:32.307 --> 31:34.017
<i>Okay.</i>

31:34.726 --> 31:37.270
<i>Your haircut is unflattering.</i>

31:38.646 --> 31:40.398
<i>Hmm...</i>

31:40.481 --> 31:43.067
<i>If the easy way
isn't gonna work,</i>

31:43.151 --> 31:45.695
<i>is there something else
I should try?</i>

31:47.614 --> 31:50.074
<i>The reason you're here
is simple.</i>

31:50.158 --> 31:52.869
<i>I'm protecting my friends.</i>

31:52.952 --> 31:55.038
<i>You see, I put
all the pieces together,</i>

31:55.121 --> 31:57.540
<i>and all roads lead to you.</i>

31:57.582 --> 32:00.376
<i>You've been blackmailing us</i>

32:00.418 --> 32:01.836
<i>and stalking us.</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:04.255
<i>And I know you killed Travis.</i>

32:04.297 --> 32:06.341
<i>Wow. This is insane.</i>

32:06.424 --> 32:09.093
Blackmail?

32:10.386 --> 32:12.555
<i>What are you even thinking?</i>

32:12.597 --> 32:15.808
<i>-I did not kill any--
- Don't bother.</i>

32:15.892 --> 32:17.894
<i>We both know what you did.</i>

32:17.936 --> 32:21.105
<i>No, you think it was me.</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:23.399
<i>If you really knew,</i>

32:23.441 --> 32:26.152
<i>I wouldn't be here.</i>

32:26.945 --> 32:29.280
<i>You seem surprisingly calm,
by the way.</i>

32:29.364 --> 32:32.033
<i>Not the first time
I've been held hostage.</i>

32:32.116 --> 32:33.743
<i>Cool.</i>

32:35.119 --> 32:37.997
<i>How did you know
about the symbol?</i>

32:38.998 --> 32:40.959
<i>What symbol?</i>

32:43.086 --> 32:46.047
<i>All I know</i>

32:46.089 --> 32:48.883
<i>is Taissa Turner hired me
to look into everyone</i>

32:48.925 --> 32:51.010
<i>who made it back
from the wilderness,</i>

32:51.094 --> 32:55.139
<i>to find out if anyone would talk
and mess up her campaign.</i>

32:56.808 --> 33:00.979
<i>By the way, Travis was murdered.</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:05.316
<i>You might not be sure
about that, but I am.</i>

33:06.234 --> 33:07.443
<i>How come?</i>

33:09.112 --> 33:13.116
<i>No, no, no. You see,
that is what we call leverage</i>

33:13.157 --> 33:14.951
<i>in my line of work.</i>

33:17.996 --> 33:20.957
<i>Let me go, and I'll tell you
everything I know.</i>

33:21.874 --> 33:25.169
<i>We're actually
on the same side, Misty.</i>

33:25.253 --> 33:28.214
<i>We should be partners on this.</i>

33:28.256 --> 33:31.175
<i>Find out who killed
Travis together.</i>

33:31.259 --> 33:33.553
<i>Right?</i>

33:36.639 --> 33:40.810
<i>What happened to the last person
who held you hostage?</i>

33:40.893 --> 33:43.354
<i>They lived happily ever after.</i>

33:47.316 --> 33:49.027
<i>This is fun.</i>

33:50.778 --> 33:52.447
But you're wrong.

33:52.530 --> 33:55.158
<i>You only have leverage if I am</i>

33:55.241 --> 33:58.703
<i>not willing to make you talk,</i>

33:58.745 --> 34:01.831
<i>which, in this case,</i>

34:01.873 --> 34:04.542
<i>means that you have
no leverage at all.</i>

34:04.584 --> 34:07.211
<i>suspenseful music</i>

34:25.104 --> 34:27.273
<i>Um, hi.</i>

34:27.356 --> 34:29.817
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

34:29.859 --> 34:31.652
<i>Sorry, I just...</i>

34:31.736 --> 34:33.237
<i>wanted to borrow
the hunting knife.</i>

34:33.321 --> 34:34.280
<i>You're not supposed to</i>

34:34.322 --> 34:37.366
<i>go through people's
private stuff, you know?</i>

34:38.451 --> 34:40.244
<i>What do you want it for?</i>

34:41.871 --> 34:43.623
<i>It's kind of, like,
this art project.</i>

34:43.664 --> 34:45.958
<i>It's probably dumb.</i>

34:54.133 --> 34:56.385
<i>Just be careful, okay?</i>

35:23.746 --> 35:26.082
<i>Go, go.</i>

35:26.165 --> 35:28.042
<i>Around the corner.</i>

35:29.168 --> 35:32.171
Is this what's supposed
to happen? What's going on?

35:32.255 --> 35:33.297
<i>Uh...</i>

35:33.381 --> 35:36.300
<i>-The driver must be in on it.</i>

35:44.267 --> 35:47.186
<i>Okay, so, what do we do now?</i>

35:47.270 --> 35:49.147
<i>-Natalie.</i>

35:49.188 --> 35:50.857
<i>-Okay. I guess we're going.
- No, no, no.</i>

35:50.940 --> 35:53.985
<i>It's a go. Let's go.
Ugh. Shit.</i>

35:54.777 --> 35:55.778
<i>What the hell?</i>

35:55.862 --> 35:58.614
<i>You've been blackmailing us,
or you know who has been.</i>

35:58.656 --> 36:00.658
<i>-Which one is it?
- No, I-I-I just work here.</i>

36:00.741 --> 36:03.619
<i>-Don't lie to me!
- Natalie, stop.</i>

36:03.703 --> 36:04.620
<i>Natalie, please
put the gun down.</i>

36:04.704 --> 36:05.872
<i>Please don't shoot me.</i>

36:05.955 --> 36:07.915

36:10.001 --> 36:11.294

- Hey!</i>

<i>There he is, there he is!

36:12.753 --> 36:14.005

<i>He wouldn't kill himself!

39:50.388 --> 39:53.224
<i>And I know you think I'm crazy,</i>

<i>but you know what I see?</i>

40:35.099 --> 40:37.309
What did Lottie say
was in her dream?

40:37.393 --> 40:39.687
<i>A river of blood?</i>

40:39.728 --> 40:41.897
<i>And a cloud of red smoke.</i>

40:41.939 --> 40:44.859
Yeah. And last night,
I dreamed I went water-skiing

40:44.942 --> 40:46.485
<i>with Princess Diana, so...</i>

40:46.569 --> 40:48.195
<i>I think that mineral deposits</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:49.947
<i>can change the water's color.</i>

40:50.030 --> 40:51.574
<i>Like iron, maybe?</i>

40:51.615 --> 40:54.285
<i>I'm sure
that's what it is, then.</i>

40:55.411 --> 40:57.079
<i>Come on,
this has been a fun detour,</i>

40:57.163 --> 40:59.123
<i>but we should keep moving.</i>

41:01.625 --> 41:03.919
<i>Um, guys?</i>

41:14.680 --> 41:18.309
<i>The iron must be messing
with the compass, right?</i>

41:18.350 --> 41:20.519
<i>I don't know. Maybe?</i>

41:20.603 --> 41:23.063
It'll probably
work again when we

41:23.147 --> 41:25.065
<i>get away from this water.</i>

41:31.197 --> 41:34.283
<i>Seriously? What?</i>

41:34.325 --> 41:36.869
<i>Should we...</i>

41:36.911 --> 41:40.372
<i>I don't know,
maybe think about going back?</i>

41:40.456 --> 41:43.667
<i>We just need
to get away from here.</i>

41:44.418 --> 41:46.462
<i>Wait, let's think about this.</i>

41:47.254 --> 41:49.715
<i>Think about what?</i>

41:50.466 --> 41:52.676
<i>I don't know. This stream?</i>

41:52.718 --> 41:56.013
<i>It is a pretty big coincidence
that Lottie dreamed about it.</i>

41:56.055 --> 41:58.140
<i>And now the compass
is acting weird.</i>

41:58.182 --> 42:00.142
<i>What did Lottie say
when we found the plane?</i>

42:03.312 --> 42:05.648
<i>It didn't want him to leave.</i>

42:06.273 --> 42:07.942
<i>You have to be
fucking kidding me.</i>

42:07.983 --> 42:10.486
<i>-I'm just saying that--
What? What are you</i>

42:10.569 --> 42:12.363
<i>just saying?
That the fucking woods</i>

42:12.404 --> 42:13.739
<i>don't want us to leave?</i>

42:13.781 --> 42:15.533
<i>Do you know
how insane that sounds?</i>

42:15.574 --> 42:17.368
<i>The woods don't give a shit.</i>

42:17.409 --> 42:20.037
<i>And all of this nonsense
with Lottie's dreams</i>

42:20.079 --> 42:23.666
<i>and omens
and whatever the fuck that is.</i>

42:25.459 --> 42:27.545
<i>We can survive
without a compass.</i>

42:27.628 --> 42:29.421
<i>We'll use the sun
to travel south,</i>

42:29.463 --> 42:32.925
<i>and we can place cairn stones
or something under trees.</i>

42:32.967 --> 42:35.928
<i>There is a solution
for everything.</i>

42:36.011 --> 42:38.264
<i>An explanation for everything.</i>

42:38.347 --> 42:41.141
<i>Now, that said, nobody
forced you to come with me.</i>

42:41.225 --> 42:42.935
<i>Anybody that wants to go back,</i>

42:43.018 --> 42:47.231
<i>by all means,
but I'm losing daylight.</i>

42:47.273 --> 42:49.316
<i>somber, dramatic music</i>

43:16.802 --> 43:20.889
<i>What the fuck is he doing?</i>

43:35.404 --> 43:36.530
<i>You're out late.</i>

43:36.572 --> 43:38.324
<i>What are you doing?</i>

43:38.365 --> 43:40.909
<i>Waiting for you.</i>

43:40.993 --> 43:42.953
<i>It's 4:00 in the morning.</i>

43:43.037 --> 43:45.080
<i>How long have you been
in my driveway?</i>

43:45.122 --> 43:47.082
<i>I guess long enough
to be out of my mind</i>

43:47.124 --> 43:49.460
<i>but not long enough
to be full stalker.</i>

43:49.543 --> 43:52.880
<i>What if my husband was here
or-or my daughter?</i>

43:52.963 --> 43:55.924
<i>I didn't see any cars,
so I made a calculation.</i>

43:55.966 --> 43:57.426
<i>And that makes it okay?</i>

43:57.509 --> 43:59.094
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

43:59.178 --> 44:00.804
<i>Go home, okay?</i>

44:00.888 --> 44:02.431
<i>What are we doing, Shauna?</i>

44:07.019 --> 44:10.022
<i>"What are we doing?"
Are you serious?</i>

44:10.648 --> 44:12.608
<i>What happened
to "go with the flow"?</i>

44:12.691 --> 44:15.527
<i>"See where life takes me"?</i>

44:15.611 --> 44:18.656
<i>I'm up at night. I don't know.
I'm wondering, like,</i>

44:18.739 --> 44:20.282
<i>maybe we could...</i>

44:20.324 --> 44:22.326
<i>Maybe we could be something.</i>

44:22.368 --> 44:25.663
<i>You are so full of shit.</i>

44:25.746 --> 44:28.248
<i>"I'm an artist.
I'm open to the universe.</i>

44:28.290 --> 44:30.668
<i>Look at me."</i>

44:30.709 --> 44:34.088
<i>That is all just a fucking act.</i>

44:35.547 --> 44:37.216
<i>All that is happening</i>

44:37.257 --> 44:41.345
<i>is that you're not in control,
and you're not used to it.</i>

44:41.428 --> 44:43.055
<i>Just fucking--</i>

44:43.097 --> 44:45.307
<i>-Just get the fuck out.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

44:45.391 --> 44:47.434
<i>That's a nice try,</i>

44:47.518 --> 44:50.187
<i>but you feel
exactly what I'm talking about</i>

44:50.229 --> 44:52.356
<i>running between us.</i>

44:54.483 --> 44:56.151
<i>Every single cell in your body</i>

44:56.235 --> 45:00.072
<i>wants to blow things up
and see what happens.</i>

45:00.114 --> 45:02.533
<i>That's who you are.</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:07.287
<i>tense, pulsing music</i>

45:48.454 --> 45:50.539
<i>slow, somber music</i>

46:00.007 --> 46:01.800
<i>I know it doesn't feel like it,</i>

46:01.884 --> 46:03.886
<i>but we're one step closer
to home.</i>

46:03.969 --> 46:05.846
<i>I promise
this will all be over soon.</i>

46:05.888 --> 46:09.057
<i>We don't need another speech,
Taissa. We need to sleep.</i>

46:17.191 --> 46:19.568
<i>I'll take
the first watch tonight.</i>

46:23.071 --> 46:26.450
<i>Let me do it.
You should all rest.</i>

46:46.261 --> 46:48.222
<i>You know what I love
about fentanyl?</i>

46:49.765 --> 46:52.434
<i>It's legal</i>

46:52.476 --> 46:54.561
<i>but deadly.</i>

46:54.645 --> 46:56.688
<i>And when someone dies from it,</i>

46:56.730 --> 46:58.816
<i>they just assume</i>

46:58.899 --> 47:01.652
<i>that it's an overdose.</i>

47:01.735 --> 47:03.320
<i>Want one?</i>

47:04.029 --> 47:05.656
<i>I don't like chocolate.</i>

47:05.697 --> 47:08.283
<i>Everyone loves chocolate.</i>

47:08.325 --> 47:10.452
<i>Especially your dad.</i>

47:10.536 --> 47:12.329
<i>Eddie, right?</i>

47:12.371 --> 47:17.292
<i>He lives at The Cliffs Dwelling
retirement home in Florida?</i>

47:17.376 --> 47:21.672
<i>Is this the correct address?
1022 Pine Street.</i>

47:22.381 --> 47:24.383
<i>I'm pretty sure it is.</i>

47:24.424 --> 47:28.095
<i>I spoke to your father's nurse,
Delores.</i>

47:28.136 --> 47:30.848
<i>Very pleasant.</i>

47:31.598 --> 47:34.059
<i>Kind of dim but nice.</i>

47:34.142 --> 47:36.436
<i>Anyway, we got to talking.</i>

47:36.520 --> 47:39.439
<i>I used a fake name, obviously.</i>

47:39.481 --> 47:43.777
<i>And she promised
to personally see to it</i>

47:43.819 --> 47:46.780
<i>that your dad
gets his favorite dessert</i>

47:46.822 --> 47:49.783
<i>from his favorite daughter.</i>

47:49.825 --> 47:51.827
<i>Okay.</i>

47:51.910 --> 47:56.832
<i>I was at Travis's house
before he was killed,</i>

47:56.874 --> 47:59.501
<i>but he wouldn't talk to me.</i>

47:59.585 --> 48:02.504
<i>I even bought him
a nice bottle of whiskey</i>

48:02.546 --> 48:04.965
<i>to loosen him up, but...</i>

48:05.007 --> 48:07.134
<i>didn't work.</i>

48:07.175 --> 48:09.386
<i>I went home after that.</i>

48:12.556 --> 48:14.641
<i>But like you,</i>

48:14.683 --> 48:18.353
<i>after I heard about his death,
I was suspicious.</i>

48:18.437 --> 48:21.273
<i>I wanted to know more.</i>

48:23.400 --> 48:25.527
<i>Well, tell me or don't.</i>

48:25.611 --> 48:28.238
<i>Post office opens at 8:30.</i>

48:30.657 --> 48:35.245
<i>Travis's bank account was closed
right after he died.</i>

48:37.331 --> 48:40.042
<i>Meaning someone other than him</i>

48:40.083 --> 48:41.919
<i>emptied his account.</i>

48:43.462 --> 48:47.382
<i>Whoever has that money
probably killed Travis.</i>

48:57.684 --> 48:59.394
<i>Fuck. Fuck.</i>

48:59.436 --> 49:00.896
<i>-Adam. Wake up. Wake up.
- Mm.</i>

49:00.979 --> 49:02.356
<i>We fell asleep. Fuck.</i>

49:02.397 --> 49:04.441
<i>I think... I think Jeff is home.</i>

49:04.524 --> 49:06.568
<i>-Um...</i>

49:13.283 --> 49:14.701
<i>Uh, the window.</i>

49:14.743 --> 49:16.828
<i>You got to go out the window.
Oh, no, fuck.</i>

49:16.912 --> 49:18.956
<i>The-the screen is rusted shut.</i>

49:18.997 --> 49:21.041
<i>Um, the-the closet.</i>

49:21.124 --> 49:23.460
<i>-Really?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.</i>

49:28.173 --> 49:29.466
<i>Okay.</i>

49:38.266 --> 49:39.726
<i>Hey. Sorry, babe.</i>

49:39.768 --> 49:42.062
<i>I did not mean to wake you.</i>

49:42.145 --> 49:44.147
<i>Oh, it's okay.</i>

49:48.110 --> 49:51.321
<i>You're just getting back
from the store now?</i>

49:51.363 --> 49:54.491
<i>Yeah. We had a delivery
coming really early,</i>

49:54.574 --> 49:56.535
<i>so I just figured,</i>

49:56.576 --> 49:59.538
<i>you know, the smartest thing
to do was just stay.</i>

49:59.621 --> 50:01.123
<i>Sure.</i>

50:04.793 --> 50:07.462
<i>Yeah, um, don't worry about it.
Just leave it on the bed.</i>

50:07.546 --> 50:10.757
<i>The hamper
is in the laundry room.</i>

50:10.841 --> 50:12.384
<i>All right.</i>

50:14.720 --> 50:16.388
<i>How was your night?</i>

50:18.974 --> 50:19.933
<i>Boring.</i>

50:19.975 --> 50:23.103
<i>Um, Callie slept at Ilana's,</i>

50:23.186 --> 50:24.855
<i>and I, um,</i>

50:24.896 --> 50:27.107
<i>just made myself...</i>

50:27.190 --> 50:29.234
<i>some soup.</i>

50:29.276 --> 50:31.570
<i>Okay. Good.</i>

50:32.195 --> 50:36.408
<i>Uh, you know what,
I'm just gonna take a shower</i>

50:36.491 --> 50:38.952
<i>and wake up a little bit here.</i>

50:39.036 --> 50:41.621
<i>-Uh, do you want some breakfast?</i>

50:41.663 --> 50:44.041
<i>I could...
I could make us some eggs.</i>

50:45.876 --> 50:47.711
<i>That sounds good.</i>

50:47.794 --> 50:49.880
<i>Thanks, babe.</i>

51:07.272 --> 51:10.275
<i>Wow. I've never been
in a French farce before.</i>

51:11.818 --> 51:15.363
<i>Okay. Wait till you hear
the sound of running water,</i>

51:15.447 --> 51:18.575
<i>count to ten,
and then get out, okay?</i>

51:50.732 --> 51:53.235
<i>Did you fuck around with my gun?</i>

51:55.195 --> 51:57.656
<i>Jesus fucking Christ.</i>

51:57.739 --> 52:00.617
<i>Natalie, what did you do?</i>

52:00.659 --> 52:03.411
<i>I robbed a liquor store.</i>

52:03.495 --> 52:05.539
<i>-What the fuck?
- Just kidding.</i>

52:05.622 --> 52:07.499
<i>I went out to get some smokes.</i>

52:07.582 --> 52:11.461
<i>I took it with me
for protection.</i>

52:11.503 --> 52:13.338
<i>And then I sat in this park,</i>

52:13.421 --> 52:16.967
<i>and I was just...
fucking around with it,</i>

52:17.050 --> 52:19.386
<i>and then
it accidentally just went off.</i>

52:19.427 --> 52:21.346
<i>But don't worry,
nobody got hurt.</i>

52:21.388 --> 52:23.014
<i>It went in the dirt.</i>

52:23.098 --> 52:25.058
<i>Every round,
I have to account for.</i>

52:25.142 --> 52:27.561
<i>-Do you realize that?
- No.</i>

52:27.602 --> 52:30.355
<i>No, course you don't. Fuck.</i>

52:30.981 --> 52:33.733
<i>Where in the park did it go off?
You're gonna have to show me.</i>

52:33.817 --> 52:35.527
<i>I don't remember.</i>

52:35.569 --> 52:38.488
<i>Well, you were on a bench,
right?</i>

52:39.906 --> 52:41.992
<i>You don't remember which?</i>

52:42.033 --> 52:43.952
<i>No.</i>

52:44.035 --> 52:45.370
<i>Were you high?</i>

52:45.453 --> 52:47.497
<i>No, I actually wasn't.</i>

52:47.581 --> 52:49.666
<i>Well, then why can't you
fucking remember?</i>

52:50.500 --> 52:51.543
<i>You know what?</i>

52:51.626 --> 52:53.879
<i>No. Okay?
I'm not sure I believe you.</i>

52:53.920 --> 52:57.048
<i>I'm not sure it even matters.
Just please, tell me honestly.</i>

52:57.090 --> 52:58.842
<i>Did you commit a crime?</i>

52:59.676 --> 53:01.428
<i>No.</i>

53:02.262 --> 53:04.723
<i>Fuck.</i>

53:04.806 --> 53:07.017
<i>You know what?</i>

53:07.100 --> 53:09.561
<i>I really thought
that we had something.</i>

53:09.644 --> 53:11.646
<i>Okay? And I thought this was--</i>

53:11.688 --> 53:13.815
<i>-Real?
- Yes. I thought it was</i>

53:13.899 --> 53:15.108
<i>fucking real.
What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

53:15.192 --> 53:18.653
<i>Well, I hate to break it to you,
but we were just fucking.</i>

53:18.737 --> 53:23.283
<i>And your whole high school crush
on me was really cute,</i>

53:23.325 --> 53:25.702
<i>but now it's just pathetic.</i>

53:29.456 --> 53:31.208
<i>Fuck you.</i>

53:51.436 --> 53:53.521
<i>tense, dramatic music</i>

55:07.262 --> 55:09.055
<i>Help!</i>

55:09.639 --> 55:13.226
<i>-Please help! Please!</i>

55:23.111 --> 55:26.489
<i>-Where's Van?!
- Taissa, she's over there! Go!</i>

55:49.346 --> 55:52.015
<i></i>

56:53.326 --> 56:55.370
<i>intense, rhythmic music</i>
