WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
ANNOUNCER: We now return to

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
"Thugnificent: Rags to Bitches."

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
y'all know what a nigga moment is.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
A nigga moment is when the mind

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
The story of Thugnificent begins here...

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
of a perfectly logical black man

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
is overwhelmed by some stupid nigga shit.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I love you, Mommy.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
in the projects of Terra-Belle, Georgia,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Like when a nigga steps up on your sneaker

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
one of the poorest and toughest towns in the country.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
and fucks up your kicks, or hits your car or some shit.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Terra-Belle leads Georgia in homicides, infant mortality,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
MAN: This is our target --
the nuclear power plant.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
And the nigga get mad

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
like it's your fault, like you fucked up.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
If we capture the plane
at precisely the right moment,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
So his ignorance makes you act crazy.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
AIDS, and everything else bad.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yo.
What up?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, you know, in Latin they say

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
they will not have time
to shoot down the aircraft.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Yo, can you hear me?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And the next thing you know, niggas is beefing,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
"terra belle" means "beautiful earth."

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Yeah, I see you, too.
What you want, nigga?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
shooting, fighting, and somebody ends up dead.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
But in Georgia, Terra-Belle means,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Oh, man, same shit.
What's up with you?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
"fucked-up place to live."

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
MAN:
If they hit that power plant

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
with that aircraft,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
The fuck you mean,
"What's up with me?"

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Terrible Terra-Belle.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, sir. That's our name for it.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
the casualties could be
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm sittin' right here
next to you.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Your voice sounds
real sexy right now.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
But yo, not even death can stop a nigga moment.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
God help us all.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Now, this right here is where I grew up.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Say what?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
I seen everything, man. Everything.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay. Ready?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
You wanna talk to me
later on?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
No, I don't wanna talk
later on, motherfucker.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I seen a nigga get killed right over there, you know?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
ANNOUNCER:  ...except...

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
They beat him up, stomped him,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
What the fuck's so sexy
about my voice?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
shot the dude, stomped the nigga again,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
What? What is this CPT?

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
DEVIL: He was the baddest motherfucker

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
that hell had ever seen.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Aw, man, my bad.
I was on the phone.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
and then I seen 'em take a dump on the dude.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
None for me,
thanks.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
WOMAN:
That means the plane is gonna

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
get here when it gets here.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Tom, I think you can have

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, great. You got one of those
ridiculous fuckin' headsets.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I swear to God, man, they actually, like,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
a second glass
on your anniversary.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Colonel motherfucking
Stinkmeaner,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm driving, sweetie-pooh.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Man, I don't know
what you be talking about.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
ANNOUNCER: They picked the wrong airline.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Heh. I don't think
one more glass

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
You know what I'm saying? They shat on the nigga, man.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Bitches like this shit, man.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
And don't come up here
complaining and shit.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
of wine will kill you.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
And I started thinking to myself: "Man...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
They be thinkin' I'm one
of them Mens in Black

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
He trained like a beast.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
You motherfuckers wanna
come on here

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
No, but driving under
the influence of alcohol

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
or somethin' like that,
you know?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and act a goddamn fool?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000

or somebody's baby.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
They think I got big things
goin' on, you know?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Y'all gonna have
to kick me out of this bitch.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm about to go on break.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
what did he do to make them niggas that mad?"

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You motherfucking terrorists
kill me.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Worse yet,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
They be wondering where
the black limo is at

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm having the time of my life.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'd spend the next 20 years
in jail being--

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
when they see --
All they see is the headpiece,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
He was so bad, he even called me,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
BOTH:
Anally raped.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Now, right over here,

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, let's talk more

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
they assume it's a black limo.
Know what I'm sayin'?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
that's where the police station used to be.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
the devil himself, a--

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
ANNOUNCER:  Come see why black incompetence...

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Hey, hey, shorty!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, they must not have liked that location much,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh, I find it
so romantic.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Bitch-ass nigga!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
TOM: Hey, I'm just saying--

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Uh, h-hold up, hold up, hold up.
This the house right here.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Whoo, whoo!

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
This is how you break your foot
off in a motherfucker's ass.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Goddamn, that bitch
phat as a motherfucker.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, okay, check it out.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
So where's the new police station?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
So...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
What? Nigga, there was no more police station after that.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
...is our funniest weapon in the war on terror.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
n-no wine, then?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Last week, right,
I was in the strip club, right.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Hyah! Hyah!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No, thank you.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Pigs got the fuck up outta here.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I had titties in one hand,
titties in the other hand.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
That's when they put

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Ah! You baldheaded
devil monks

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
We can't let you through,
homey.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
this big-ass fence up around the city.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, this is Osama bin Laden
nephew, nigga.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I had two hands
full of titties.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I-- I'm --
I'm once removed. I-I--

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That's bigger
than two scoops of raisins.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
No --
I just fucking with you, dawg.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
You just got a two-piece combo
and biscuit, ho.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
So, what was it like

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm still talkin' to my
accountant at the same time.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
growing up in a place like this?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Go ahead, nigga.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
It was hard, you know? A lot of people don't know

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
ANNOUNCER: Starring Gary Anthony Williams.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, oh--
Oh, my gosh.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
What's not to like
about  that?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But you know what they say --
when it's your time to go,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
that places like this even exist in America.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Okay. First of all, I don't know
when you talkin' to me

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
or when you're talkin'
on the goddamn phone.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
They don't know how dirty the South really gets.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What if it's the motherfucker
next to me time to go? Huh?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Second, when people
wear those things,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Gotcha, nigga.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Mm-hm.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
GIRL:  Hey! That's a damn shame.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Mo'Nique.
It's very important

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
they appear to be
talkin' to theyselves.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
TOM:
Ah. Now, that's what

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I like to see.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
There's a name for people
who talk to theyselves, Ed.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I feel it.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
But that's real shit, though, nigga.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
this plane leave on time.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000

You got naked kids.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Damn. Now, are you yelling
at me or shitting at me?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
They're called the homeless.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You got parents gotta choose between food and clothes

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
has earned you a trip back.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Snoop Dogg.
Hijacked?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Man, bitches love this
Bluetooth shit. Changed my life.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
for their kids, shorty.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Them niggas ain't getting
my wizzie fo' shizzle, nigga.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, my. No, honey,
don't sing. Not again.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
You have my blessings
to exact vengeance

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know what to do
with my hands now.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
You know what I'm saying? And 50 Cent

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
A while for me?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Be that as it may, no technology
is worth my dignity.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
on the Freeman family

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
and to spread
ignorance and chaos

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
as Air Marshal 50 Cent.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
SARAH: Um, Tom. Tom...

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Or for themselves.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
If talking on a wireless headset
mean I gotta look

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
in the black community.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
...people are looking.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's real out here, nigga.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'll stop
those terrorists...

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
They will be no match
for you.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Tom, please.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
like Buck Rogers,
then I'm not interested.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
or die trying.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Besides, there's a reason

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Honey. Honey, maybe this isn't
the best place to be singing--

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
why people hold the phone
to their head, Ed.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
STINKMEANER:
Ah! Hell ain't shit.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Get ready. This time, it's going down.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
You can't go on

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
It lets people around you know
you're talkin' on the phone.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm gonna get you, Freeman!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So those people know not
to waste time talkin' to you

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
This is a hijacking.
Remain in your seats --

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
until you're finished,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yay. All done.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
No, this nigga
didn't.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
which you indicate by
puttin' that motherfucker away.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
We have a bomb on the aircraft.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Every time we come in.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Everyone remain --

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Good.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
SARAH:
Yay.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
ED: You know, I like
the way your booty looks

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Ah! Oh, my God.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
when you bend over.
I like that a lot.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
What is it, honey?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Very sexy.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Wait. Is that Usher?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Mm-hm. I can make it
over there later.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm about to go
get dressed.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yes! Oh, my God.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, I'm  real  ready.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I hate these
fucking headsets.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
He's coming over.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
We gonna fly on the
Soul Plane!

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I can't believe this.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
TOM:
Oh, sweetie,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
you hit the table.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Hey, how you doin', babe?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
GIRL 1:
I think he's in there.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Hi, uh, uh, Mr. Usher.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
GIRL 2: There's probably
gonna be a lot of orgies.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
-I can't believe it.
-It's not true.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I-- I can't believe
it's you.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
This is, like,
the greatest thing

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
that ever happened
in our neighborhood.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm Sarah.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
...where you can, like, track,
like, if someone, like,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You have a beautiful smile,
Sarah.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Mm-hm.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
does anything weird.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Mm! Wow, so she's
on my friends list?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
What in the hell?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
What's going on?
What's going on?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yup, she your very first
cyber friend

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
A while for me?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and you're her 3 millionth.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, he's moving in.
Who?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
SARAH:
I love this song.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You really should come
to more of

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah, boy! I love technology.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
the community council
meetings, Robert.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I ain't worried about
no damn council meeting.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
HUEY: My granddad recently

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
discovered online dating.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, wonderful.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Tell me who's moving in.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
You should post more pics.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
GIRL 1:
He's coming, you guys!

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Thank you very much.
Oh. Oh, God.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Ho's love pictures,
Granddad.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Everybody get ready!
GIRL 2: Oh, my gosh.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Uh--

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm starting to feel
like Shemar Moore up in here.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Totally, you know.
Like, oh, my gosh.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That was beautiful.
It's just what I do.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Oh, um, this is,
uh...Tom.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Hoo! Boy, let's get
some music on.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Get ready, you guys.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Turn on the My-pod
and let's get on the I-space.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
GIRL 1:
You guys, he's coming.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, I'm Tom. Just Tom.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
HUEY:  It was the third house to get robbed

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
RILEY: Wait, wait, wait.
I know that song.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
GRANDDAD:
Riley, hurry up.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
in Woodcrest in less than a week.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
USHER:
Hey, how

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
you doin'?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
The police were talking

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Thugnificent!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
to everyone on our street for clues.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
RILEY:
Hey, which outfit

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
you want next, Granddad?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
SARAH:
You are so interesting.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
...came from that area
over there, uh, running...

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
booty-butt cheeks

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
We gonna fly on
the  Soul Plane!

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
USHER: You're interesting.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The leather vest.
The one with the rhinestones.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
booty-butt cheeks

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Well,  almost  everyone.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
B-B-B-Booty-Butt cheeks

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
If you don't
mind me asking,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
...do they gallop still?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
And make sure you pee
before we leave.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
He had a gallopy gait
to him.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Granddad, I--

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I ain't gonna miss my movie

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
where did you learn
to dance like that?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
going to the bathroom
with you.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I've never seen anyone dance
like Michael Jackson before.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
GIRL: Thugnificent!
Thugnificent, wait!

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Officer, I'm not finished.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I can come back.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm gonna let you go in there
by yourself

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Boy, get over here
and take this picture.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
and get molested
by a nasty white man.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, I've been dancing
for as long as I remember.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Hello, sir,
I'm Officer Calloway.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
booty-butt cheeks

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
It's not just the music.
I have seen all of your movies.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm here to --
I didn't see nothin',

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Now, what's wrong with you?
Why the long face?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Oh, man!

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What's wrong with you?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't know nothin'.
Cheers.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't wanna go to the movie.
Why not?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I had a bad dream
about--

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Thugnificent and the Lethal
Interjections living  here.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't ever wanna go
to the movies with you again.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Really? Even  Light It Up?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Uh...cheers.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I loved  Light It Up.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Granddad really didn't know

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Talk and shoot
at the same time, boy.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Not after
what happened last time.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
anything about the break-ins.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Thug who?
Thugnificent.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I named my dog Light It Up.
Girl, please.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
RILEY:
Granddad, you want

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
"Beat It" or "Thriller"?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What happened last time?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But his unwillingness to talk with the police

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I can't believe it.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We got arrested. And  shot at.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
My mama wouldn't
even see  Light It Up.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
is a common trait with black people.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Mmm, that's a tough one.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
So funny.
She's my manager.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
GIRL:
Wait up. Wait up.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Ah. Racism.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm gonna talk to your mom.
She on MySpace.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Take 'em back
and go get my purple Speedo.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Daddy said I can go
to the movies,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I'll call her.
Hee-hee-hee.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's no secret that black people

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
RILEY:
Purple Speedo?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
That's gay.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
but he said I'm not allowed
to see  Soul Plane.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Are you a natural blond?
Oh. Oh, you are so funny.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
are culturally inclined against snitching.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
All right, boy,
so you had a bad dream.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Good. You don't wanna go
to the movies with him.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, one more.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Hey, I ain't seen nothin'.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It was a really bad dream
about--

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
He's crazy.
Hush.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
RILEY:
I don't see the purple one.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Please, we gotta get one more.
Look at that one.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Hell, nah!

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Did you check
the Speedo drawer?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Can't see  Soul Plane?
Why, little baby?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Man, fuck yo' mama!

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Go ahead, boy.
Bad dream and...?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Because of the types
of stereos or something.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's go get
some fresh air.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It'd be good
for my vocals.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
But recently, what was once

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It was about
Stinkmeaner.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Types of stereos?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Sorry, man.
SARAH: I'm ticklish.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
an unwritten rule about snitching

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Leopard print's
all I could find.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh. No, no, no,
little baby doll.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
USHER:
I'm gonna

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
tickle you again.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
has become a full-blown "stop snitching" movement,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Oh, man.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Wouldn't let that shit
happen to me though.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
This is a good theater.
They have THX.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
USHER:
You rollin' with Ush.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
complete with merchandising.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Damn, these things are tight.
What about Stinkmeaner?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Take the murder of 19-year-old Jermaine "Lojack" Walker,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Alright, Thugnificent!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
He was in hell, and he was
coming back to get us.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
She means stereotypes.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
And this is where I put
the rabbit ears behind his head.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
That's right, y'all.
Put your hands up, white folks!

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Stereotypes? In  Soul Plane?
That's nonsense.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
who was shot during a street-basketball tournament

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Stinkmeaner? Don't be crazy.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
That old man that Granddad
killed for no reason?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
in the middle of a summer afternoon

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
'Cause Thugnificent's
in the motherfucking...

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Say, how about we tell
your daddy

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Ha-ha. See, honey?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No reason?
That man was a psycho.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yes, yes,
I see the ears.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
in front of at least 300 eyewitnesses.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
we saw something else, hm?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
He almost killed
your granddaddy.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Man, I wanna go
over there,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Nobody even called the cops. They all just went home.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
You mean...lie?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Don't you think
your behavior might have been

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
He was blind.
You killed a blind old man.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
but I don't wanna
dick ride, you know?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
the slightest bit
inappropriate?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Colonel Stinkmeaner
was a menace.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Would that be dick riding?
You think? To go over there?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That really doesn't seem to be
a good idea.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
But despite the cultural stigma against it,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hush, boy.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, stop being insecure.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And I sent him to hell
where he belongs.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You know,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
a whopping one in 12 black men in poor neighborhoods

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
it's okay to break
the rules

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
You were flirting.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
What it do, Woodcrest?
Ha-ha!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
He asked me
to send him the pictures.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
is an active informant.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, Granddad,
real tough with the handicapped.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
every once
in a while.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
What's 'hood in the Wood,
white folks?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I won't tell
if you won't.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Tom, you know
I'm a big Usher fan.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
You damn right, Mr. Policeman!
I saw the whole thing!

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
He probably gonna beat up
some retarded kids next.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I just wanna say
we happy to be out here

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay. Hee-hee.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So is Jazmine,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
which make sense,
because she's 10.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
This retarded man
gonna whup your ass,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
in our new crib
in Woodcrest...

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
HUEY:  Sometimes I think Granddad may be a bad influence.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What's that supposed to mean?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
HUEY: That means every party...

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
that's what he's gonna do.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
A'ight. What if I just
go over there

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It means you're
a bit old to be acting

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Wait-- You know what I meant!
What were we talking about?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
and give him a pound and be
like, "What up, Thugnificent?"

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Hey, Riley. Don't forget
the camcorder.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
like some screaming TRL  groupie.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
...every cookout...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Like, not really all on
his sac or nothing? Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Oh, yeah, your dream.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, the first  Soul Plane
was funny.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Stop the car.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I'm here for everybody.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Look, boy,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Pfft. About as funny
as a lynching.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Now, now, we won't have
any of that. Just calm down.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
...every wedding...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Stinkmeaner ain't coming back.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Get back here, Riley.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, hush, boy.
You ain't even see it.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
-Aw, come on, Granddad.
-Oh, no.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Stop the car!

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
probably has someone secretly working as an informant.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
He can't hurt you or me
or any of us, okay?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I never seen
a lynching, either,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I'll be right --

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
but I know
they not funny.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
THUGNIFICENT: My house is
your house. All is yours.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Where I live,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
See? Shows what you know.
I've seen funny lynchings.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
snitchin' is more like a recreational hobby.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Now, let's get one more picture.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I don't want either of you going
near that house. You hear me?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
No, you haven't.
I have so.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
They even have a club for snitches.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Roscoe Patterson's lynching
was funny.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I might buy everything.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
It's called the neighborhood watch.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Know what? Uh,
I don't wanna dick ride.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, so them
niggas was like,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
HUEY: Some people are scared

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
of zombies or vampires,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So I'm gonna just, uh,
go back to the house.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
"Roscoe, you better
leaves town

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
No snitchin'!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Hold it right there, boy!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
but the thing that scare black people the most

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
"before Mr. Charlie
and them crackers

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Uh, are you mad?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
THUGNIFICENT:
...our new crib in Woodcrest,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Woodcrest
neighborhood watch.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
are niggas and nigga moments.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
gonna come for you."

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
with all these trees
and white bitches and lemonade

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Now, where was you at 11:00
last night, huh? Huh?!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm like, "Man,
fuck them crackers, man.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Tom DuBois was as far from a nigga

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
and bagels and shit.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This is Roscoe Patterson."
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
RILEY:
Usher?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Come on, now!
Don't lie to me, nigga!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
But you know how we do.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Nigga, I was in bed.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
as a black man could be.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
We bring the 'hood with us,
right here.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I just don't
give a fuck.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That nigga's my age.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
No, you wasn't.
I seen you with my own eye.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
But Stinkmeaner knew that every black man's spirit

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Now let's make it rain.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Know what I'm saying?
White man can eat a dick.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So you guys don't think
I'm overreacting?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
You was robbing white people's
houses, wasn't you?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
GIRL:
Yeah. This is fantastic.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Eat my balls,
nigga.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
is weakened during a nigga moment.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Ha-ha. Whoo.
That's right, nigga.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't think so.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
MAN: There he is!
Get that nigger.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And--
Oh, look at them wheels!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
You're a bigtime lawyer,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
What the--?!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm about to do it big
in Woodcrest, nigga.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Uh-oh.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and Sarah's acting all crazy
over an usher?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
The law say
when the bicycle stop,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Right across the street,
I'm gonna put a club.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh, come on, you n--
Nincompoop.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Come on,
let's go!

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Not an usher. Usher.
He's a singer.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
the wheels
supposed to stop.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Uh, next door is gonna be
my detail shop.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
MAN: Oh, shoot, he's fast!
Watch out!

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
You need a special permit
for wheels like that.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
You can't do that!
Hey, come on.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Nigga, I'm about to clear
all this shit out. Ha-ha!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It, uh, wasn't really
funny after that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Ushers ain't supposed
to sing.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You can't hear
the movie.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, come back here!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Mm-mm.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Nigga moments can happen to any black man at any time.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
GIRL:
Welcome to

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
the neighborhood.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I finished cleaning
the storm drain for you, Robert.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm calling the police.
Stop!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Huh? That's right, y'all.
Thugnificent bringing the 'hood

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This  is going to be...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh. What's wrong?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
OLD MAN:
Can we bring in the Army?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Hey, I-- That was my space.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
...the worst day
of your life.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Tom's wife is cheating on him
with a singing usher.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
How long will we wait
on the police to protect us?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
to this very street.
Heh-heh.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I had my blinker on
and everything.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The ghetto is here,
y'all. Heh.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, I didn't say
she was cheating.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Fuck you, punk-ass,
bougie-ass, hook-ass nigga!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Ain't this a bitch?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm bringing nunchucks.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Lord, Lord, Lord.
How did you end up

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Can we bring in
the Army?!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'll beat
your motherfucking ass, nigga!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Who in the hell
left the gate open?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Huh?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
with that white woman
anyway?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
This is a tragedy.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
...'cause I love it. Heh.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
The white man ain't never
done nothin' to nobody,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Don't never in your life
ever try to holler at me.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I say toss her groupie ass
out the window

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
What up, old nigga?!

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Fuck with me, nigga,
and I'll be popping a trunk

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and let that ho stargaze
from outside.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
and he don't deserve this.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
on your bitch ass, nigga.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
You got some words
of welcome

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Now, Riley,
there's never a place

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
TOM: Wait, everyone.
Please, order.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Get my motherfucking Uzi.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
for all this
Thugnificence?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
for violence
in a relationship.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Come on over here.
Do it big, man.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
People, calm down.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
There sure seemed to be a place
at the restaurant last night.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
This is our fault.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Thug out with the homey.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
We've let the predators
think we're weak.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
What did you say, nigga?!

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Mm-mm.
Nappy-headed hos.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Here, put these coats on.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
She made you look like a bitch
in front of Usher.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Has the Department
of Homeland security

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
You know what, motherfucker?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Huh?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Boy, watch
your mouth.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Eat a dick, nigga.
I'm tired of this mo--

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Probably
started out charitable.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
ruled out terrorism?!

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh, yeah? Well, fuck you,
old-ass nigga!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
GRANDDAD:
Here you go.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
She took you in, was probably
teachin' you how to read.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It was them Freeman boys.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Stop hating and get money,
my nigga.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What is it?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's pinto beans
and neck bones.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm telling you, you can't
trust them new niggas.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
You just mad at
all this Thugnificence.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
But, Granddad, she did make
Mr. DuBois look like a bitch.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, yeah, look at ya.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Now put this meat loaf
and gravy under your shirt.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah, I said it.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
You was popping all that
good shit a second ago.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Respect it, man!

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Why don't we just get treats
from the concession stand?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah. We know she made Tom
look like a bitch,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
-Now, Ruckus, that's crazy.
-If they're so innocent,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
breathe it in, nigga.
Bask in it.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
but find a different way
to say it.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Then you got kicked
in your chest.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Next thing you know,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
why won't they talk
to the police?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
you rubbin' against
that silky white skin. Oh.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
You eat a dick, nigga,
you eat a dick!

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You think I'm paying $20
for some popcorn?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
-What did he say?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Now, where were we?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
RUCKUS: Yeah.
Why wouldn't they?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
But I don't know
the non-curse way

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Uh, I don't know. I -- I think it's pretty cool, I guess,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
You must be out
of your damn mind.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Doesn't sound like
innocent behavior to me.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
to say he got bitched.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Humiliated,
castrated, emasc--

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Why wouldn't they
wanna talk to the police?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh-- Oh, my God.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
having a big celebrity move in.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Are we allowed
to bring in food?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Sir, are you okay?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Of course we're allowed to.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, all right, all right.
I get the point.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, I don't really know much about him,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I  love  talking
to the police.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Who did this to you?
What--? What did he look like?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
but my two teenage kids are very excited.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's my food, isn't it?
I paid for it.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I mean, I can see
if it was a real nigga.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We're gonna go check 'em out.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That means I can eat it
when and where I want.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
If the cops won't make 'em talk,
I'll make 'em talk.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Did-- Did anyone see
who accosted this man?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You know, they love him.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
If you lost
your ho to T.I.,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I'd be like,
"Hey, that's T.I."

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
They have the CD diskettes and the video games

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Boy, put this pot roast in
your pants or you ain't eating.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Mrs. von Hausen,
the neighborhood watch

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I got a date?
I can't believe it.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, this is nothing.
He's just getting started.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
But Usher?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
and the dungarees with his name on the, um, pocket.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
is not
a law-enforcement agency.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Of course you got
a date, Granddad.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
You better check that ho,
Mr. DuBois.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Everything on your page
is a lie.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You know what?
You guys are right.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I don't want them damn niggas

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
No interrogations!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
No, it is not.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
living across the street from me. Shoot.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
HUEY: Robert Jebediah Freeman

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm gonna go back there
and put her in check.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Granddad, you don't skydive,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
had sworn a lifetime intifada

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Now, if you visit
the Freemans

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Paid too much money for my house. Funny-ass music.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and ask them to join
the neighborhood watch,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
you're not Brazilian,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
against the movie theater industry

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
For example,
how many white women

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
for exorbitant prices and poor customer service,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
that would be great.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and you never was
a member of G-Unit.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
want to go to a basketball game
just to see the game,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
And let's all of us reach out
to all our other neighbors

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Mind your damn business.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
which, interestingly enough,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
And she probably a man.
Shut up.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Get 'em outta here.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
come back with one of them
NBA niggas out of sympathy?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
did not stop him from going to see movies.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
to help us keep an eye out.
Okay?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
MAN: Thugnificent and his cohorts,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Macktastic and Flonominal,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, gang.
Keep your eyes open.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
She came to
see the game.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
MAN:
So, Mrs. Wong,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
She wanted to be
entertained.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
MAN:
Well, that's sensible.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Open for what?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
there you were not carjacking Mr. Teskinelli,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
formed the Lethal Interjection Crew

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We're sneaking in.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
MAN 2: The black one's right.
Really, he is.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, the white woman's
got a big heart.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
and tasted success early with the smash club anthem

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's not true,
little baby.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, we're gonna
reach out, all right.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
beating him senseless with a nine iron,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I bought my tickets online.
Scout's honor.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Lord, she's got a big heart.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
"Booty-Butt Cheeks."

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
stealing his wallet and driving his car

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Look. Granddad.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Now Thugnificent has a new

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I got some money saved.
The movie will be on me.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
into the hosiery section of the JCPenney?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
multimillion-dollar major-label deal,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Correct.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Now, you put that away,
boy.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
a new house in the suburbs,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
These movie devils
ain't getting

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I have no further
questions.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and a new album, "Rags to Bitches."

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
any more of our money.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
What the hell do y'all want?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Mm-mm.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We'll ask the questions
around here, Robert.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Now, Mrs. Wong,
let me ask you a question.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You see, "Rags to Bitches" is more than a album.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Uh...Mr. Freeman?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Ask the question,
Miss von Hausen.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
You know what I'm sayin'? I consider it as a movement.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
The way I'm looking at it, I'm picking up where

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It says, "No outside food,"
little girl.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I don't have time
for this crap!

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Is your granddad home?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Get out the way,
old white woman.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
What's good, nigga?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Malcolm X left off, nigga. It's that big.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's why we keep it
inside our clothes.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
VON HAUSEN:
Mr. Freeman,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Ahhh!

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Are you sure
this is legal?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
we are from the Woodcrest
neighborhood watch.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
This is the movement that says, you know --

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad.
Mr. DuBois' at the door.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh, my God.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Now, as you know, we've had
some home invasions recently.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Excuse me,
Mr. DuBois?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
"Don't grow up and act like a fucking fool all the time,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay, everybody, look alive now.
Here's our chance.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
You's a bitch.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
-Mm-hm.
-We were concerned to hear

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Ahem. Well, I-I said, um...

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
and you can still make it up out the 'hood

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
and enjoy everything that life has to offer."

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I understand
you need your job,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, Tom, I'm sorry
to hear about the split.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
that you refused
to talk to the police.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
but you're still
a human being with dignity.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
What's really good?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I would love to
let you crash,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
-I didn't see nothin'!
-You tell 'em, granddad.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, I mean,
look at this uniform, man.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
but I just don't know
where you would stay.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
No snitchin'.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I look like
a fucking dork.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
JUDGE:
Is there something really good

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Why would they make me dress
like this?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Maybe the guest room.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
You've also refused
our previous invitations

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
you'd like to share
with the court, Mr. DuBois?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What did I do
to them, huh?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You should take action.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Who told him about
the guest room?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
to join
the neighborhood watch,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and we could use
your support.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Fuck your court, nigga!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Ah. What can  I  do?

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
Our motto is:
Neighbors watching neighbors.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Mr. DuBois!
Fuck your court, nigga!

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Thank you so much,
Robert.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
See, boys? See why

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Have you ever thought about
forming a union?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I tell you marriage is bad?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Fuck your court!

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh, I'm watchin', all right.
I'm watchin' this neighborhood

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What's a "union"?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't care
what nobody say.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
RUCKUS: It's like somebody threw
a million dollars

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I ain't never
gettin' married.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
become a bunch
of damn tattletales.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
into the monkey cage at the zoo.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I paid.
I got my ticket.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Lady Liberty's got balls!

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Good one, granddad.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It breaks my heart
to watch

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, yeah. I got
a ticket for you.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You killin' 'em.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
the "negridation"
of this decent place.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
A one-way ticket
to "Get the hell

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Statistically speakin',
it was bound to fail anyway.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Property was stolen,
Mr. Freeman.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, no.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Well, we can't live
next to their kind.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
out of here, negro"
land.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Go on! Move it!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
RUCKUS: Stolen.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
The sanctity of our
community was violated.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
We have kids.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I ain't gonna
stand for it.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Tough titty.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
What's good, nigga?!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
We were here first.
Right.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
GRANDDAD:
What we gonna do?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
TOM: Well, I'd sell my house
if I thought

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Nigga, you gay.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Boy, I'll be back tonight.
Move the hell out of my way.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
it was still
worth anything.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
How about that?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
See it's burnin' me
to hold onto this.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Robert, did you just
touch a white woman?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Why don't you just
invite them over for dinner

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Another victory
of the common man

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
HUEY: Meanwhile, I couldn't

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
shake the feeling

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
and get to know
one another?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
over corporate greed.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You're not advancing
any struggle

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I know this is something
I gotta do.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
RUCKUS: Sorry he touched you,
Miss von Hausen.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
that an evil force was gathering.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I guess I could do that.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
by being cheap,
Granddad.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
We'll make sure
you get sterilized.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
MACKTASTIC:
What's happening, nigga?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I'll advance my belt
on your behind

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
if you don't shut
your ass.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Whoa, whoa! Look out!

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Where the chicken wings
and the doughnuts at?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, my God.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Sarah--

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
You almost touched
Miss von Hausen!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I must be crazy.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
What the fuck you got to eat
in this bitch, nigga?!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I didn't pay
to get in the movie.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Stop snitchin'!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
MAN: Nah, you ain't crazy.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I love you

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Uh, yes, we did. I --
I ordered my tickets online.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Stinkmeaner's coming back.
But Stinkmeaner died.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It's just, I feel like this

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Who got the neck bones?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Mm-mm. That shit
ain't happening.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
No, you didn't.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
What you gonna tell me, ghosts don't exist?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
is coming to an end.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
We snuck in.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Then what the fuck do I look like?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Ghostface Killah
isn't even dead.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
We stole a movie.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Now, who makes the rules?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Now, you say what you want,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
that goofy-looking motherfucker is coming back.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Grownups, right?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Hey, boy.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Your granddad's nigga moment ain't dead yet.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And I'm grown up,
and I say it's okay.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But what am I
supposed to do?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Go to bed soon.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Good night, Granddad.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
If death can't stop Stinkmeaner,
what can?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I should call my daddy
and turn myself in.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Think about it. Peace.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, yeah?
You gonna tell him

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
To say this

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
-Shh-shh-Shh.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
what you came to see,  huh?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
From my heart

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I bet he'd like
to know that.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What the hell going on
out here?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Maybe  I  should make
a phone call.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But we did fell apart

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
RUCKUS: Oh...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
No. Please, no.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Good. Now just
calm down.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Hey! Shut up
all that damn noise!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
RUCKUS: Mm-hm.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Try some mashed potatoes.
Who got the popcorn?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
ED: If you had
a headset like mine,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm a old man. Y'all need to
listen to some Nat King Cole

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I do, Granddad.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
you could be on the phone
right now.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and some Johnny Mathis.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Nah, baby, I'm still here.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Look, Granddad,
I'm really worried about--

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Ow! Hey.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
What the hell is wrong
with you?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Watch it, boy,
don't step on my roses.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What am I gonna do
with raw popcorn?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Oh, shit!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
No.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
VON HAUSEN:
What was that?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Then why you putting them
on the floor?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
You're gonna ruin my dentures.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
-Uh...
-Come on!

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Whew. Damn, can't watch
a movie without popcorn.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But, anyway, I know
this is gonna sound crazy,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Heh. Word down at the gym
is that he done wore

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
but I really think
Stinkmeaner's--

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Now I gotta spend
all my damn money

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I gotta deal with

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh, hush, boy,
I ain't got time for that.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
on a bucket
of popcorn.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
the same pair of drawers
for the last three days.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Now, it's date night
and you know the rules.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Hear that?
Sounds like niggas.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You get in that room.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Told you.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
-Shh!
-Then he go and lift weights.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't care
if you hear scream

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
USHER:

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
and feel the house shake
like a earthquake.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
RUCKUS: What you see,
Miss von Hausen?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
When your feeling

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You don't leave.
Now, git!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Shit, he -- he just hatin'

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You gotta let it go

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I ain't even tell Janet
anything about what you told me.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
WOMAN:
Why don't you call her, then?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Jumpin' like it used to

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Would you get off
that fucking phone?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, shit!

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
MAN: That's what I'm
talkin' about here.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Honey, I'm home.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
RUCKUS: Buck 'em down,
Miss von Hausen!

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Let it burn

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Hey, honey.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
We're takin' fire! Run!

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh, yeah!

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
-RUCKUS: Get them negroes!
-ED: They shootin'!

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I think I wanna have
sexual relations.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
It's best

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Hey, hey, hey. Little homey.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
No, no, no, I'm still here.
Yo, can I still come over?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Tom, what's gotten into you?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Hulk up, my nigga.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Of her being with someone--

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You ain't got no drink?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Come on. You want
some of this? Come on.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Same thing
that's about to get into you.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh. Help me.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Get some of this
Incredible Hulk, little nigga.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
MAN:
Car!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
RUCKUS: Feel the power
of the white folk.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh, Tom!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Get 'em,
Miss von Hausen!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Thanks, man.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
That's the way!
Wait, Miss von Hausen.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
STINKMEANER:
Oh, yeah!

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm gonna make it do
what it do.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Hey, my name
is Riley,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I'll give you anything. Ah!

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Wait! Let me have
a piece of that.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
and I live
across the street.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
SARAH:
Oh, Tom!

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Come on, now!
Buck 'em down!

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, with
the mean old man?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah,
that's my granddad.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
RUMMY: Riley!
Hey, Riley, look, man,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
ANNOUNCER: Don't steal movies.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Don't mind him.
He a hater.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I need somewhere to hide.
Niggas are shootin', man.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Look, I don't wanna be
dick riding

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Niggas are shootin'?
ED: Hey!

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
or nothing, you know.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This the car that got
pimped out by Xzibit.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I just wanna say that
I like your music.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Say, motherfucker, you on the
phone or you talking to me?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And, uh, you know,
this is my turf over here,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Hello?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm talkin' to Riley.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and I'm holding it down
for all the young G's.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
SARAH: It's Sarah.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
GRANDDAD: Damn.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
How are you, baby?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Hey, y'all see the new rims
I got on my bike?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
So, you know,
holler at your man

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Large freshly popped popcorn,
please. And lots of butter.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You're still taking Jazmine

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
This thing has a push-button
starter like a racecar.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
if you need anything.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I ain't on your nuts,
though.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
to her recital practice at 3, right?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Anything else?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yes.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
So you wouldn't
even need a key.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I asked
for butter on it.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
What--? What is that in the background?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh, man.
Respect, little partner.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Butter's over there.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
RILEY: I know y'all niggas
not tryin' to jack Dorothy.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, I'm in the studio
with Snoop Doggy Dogg

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Hey, this little nigga's
all right, y'all.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Are you doing the music video thing again?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't wanna put the butter
on it. Why can't you do it?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Hey! Nigga,
get your motherfucking feet

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Whoa, whoa!
What y'all doin'?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
and Tha Pound tonight.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
off the table.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Gotta go, honey. Bye.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
We're just gonna borrow
the car for a little while,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You're supposed to
put the butter on it.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
So many hours

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You know your mama
taught you better than that,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't wanna
put the butter on it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Don't worry about it.
W-We bring it right back.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
ghetto-ass nigga.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm already paying $20
for this bullshit popcorn.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
We bring it right back, bro.
Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Hold up.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm still burnin'

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Get your mother--
hey!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
But how about, uh,
tomorrow, cutie pie?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Who put the motherfucking
Kool-Aid...

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I will not demean myself

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
When your feelin'

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Y'all can't take
my granddad's car.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
by putting butter
on popcorn.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Semicolon,
right parenthesis. Mm.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
...in the Jacuzzi?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Stop, Ed.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Why? It's really easy.
Why?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Don't want to

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
You can't take the car.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
STINKMEANER: Ha!

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Because I don't work at
the movie theater, that's why.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
What the--?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
WOMAN #2: Whoo!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You're supposed to put
the butter on it.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Whoa. This is nice.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Who's out there?
Boys! Boys, help me.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
If I go to Burger King
and order a cheeseburger,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Bruise you

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm back, nigga!
Oh, what the--?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they don't make me put
the cheese on it, do

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they, Goddamn it!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Let it burn

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I see, I see. Just 'cause
your skin is light, bright,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, my Lord!

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Let it burn

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
RILEY: Hell, no!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So then I say
to R. Kelly,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Gotta let it burn

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
and two shades
from being white,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
GRANDDAD: Was that a bomb?! Bin
Laden ain't mad at me, is he?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
"Did you wash
your hands?"

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
you think you too good
to butter your own popcorn.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
-Man, they got the car.
-Huh?!

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Hey, for real?
On the real?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Yo, this little nigga funny,
man.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Come on.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, you wrong,
Lando Calrissian.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Let it burn

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
This little
nigga like

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Charlie Murphy
or some shit, man.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, sweet Jesus!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Tom, just don't try
to hurt me!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Hey, man.
This your brother?

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Damn it, Ruckus. Y'all gonna
put some butter on this popcorn.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's burning.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They stole Dorothy, Lordy!

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, Lordy Lord.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Hello. Goodbye.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Yo, nigga.
Your brother told us

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
VON HAUSEN: He saw it!
He saw everything.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
What the hell?!
Tom, what's going on?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
how you be all
into reading and shit.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Hey, Tom.
Shut the fuck up.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Tom, go away!
I'm gonna call the police.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Hey, that's some real
good shit, my nigga, for real.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy, watch your mouth.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Riley, who did this?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Did you hear that?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Congratulations, nigga.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
We put our lives on the line
every day to make movies,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Tom, shut
the fuck up.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Man, I can't hear nothing
over Granddad's gay-ass music.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Damn it. Hurry up, boy.
Tell us who did it.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Did you just
congratulate me for reading?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and then people come along
and steal all that hard work.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry. I'm so cold.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Now, you're gonna tell me
who stole my car

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Look out, new message.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Word. Oh, yeah,
man, you know,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
or I'm gonna get my belt or a
2x4 and go upside your head!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who would do something
like that?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
good shit, homey.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Word. You know what I mean?
You know, that reading shit,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
A terrible, awful human being
that no one will ever love.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Ah, man. It's an old dude
with his shirt off.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
you know what I mean,
it's hard, son.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Could be worse.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Wait, that's Granddad.
Ooh, he in the bathroom.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's who.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
GRANDDAD: Tell me who stole
my car. Nobody steals my car.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Word. You know
what I mean? Word.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Stuntman.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Could have been
Omarion.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
You know what I mean?
Especially when them books be

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I pays for my car!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Probably just ran out
of toiler paper again.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
you know what I mean,
you know,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
really thick and heavy-like,
you know what I mean?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Thank you for that
perspective, Huey.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But what would my niggas
think of me if I snitched?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I ain't getting it
for him neither. Nope.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Word. You know
what I mean?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Hey. Get to the flick.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Wait a minute.
What niggas?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
No problem.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Hey, I got niggas.
HUEY: Where?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Why would he send
a message from--?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Uh, we're gonna take off.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
What happened
to the movies?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Hey!

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
This doesn't seem to be
a place for kids.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Y'all should be
ashamed.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
So I said, "I ain't paying
for dinner and a movie, woman.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
In the street.
What streets?

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
What the hell?
Tom, what's going on?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
The fuck you talking
about, man?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Why is it
when I order a soda pop,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
GRANDDAD: I ain't asking
no more. Come here!

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
We got PlayStation
and Xbox, nigga.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I get a empty cup?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
"You must have lost
your damn mind.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I didn't order
a empty cup.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Shoot, I don't care
if you  are  Eva Mendes."

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Mm-mm. I can't do it, Granddad.
I can't talk to the po-po.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And we got Incredible Hulks,
nigga.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I ordered a soda pop.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And what asshole started putting
commercials in movies?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Wait. What was
the question?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Tell Granddad.
He's not the police.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, my goodness,
the man is crazy.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
All the kids is
welcome, motherfucker.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I can see commercials
at home on TV.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
That's right.
You can tell me.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
STINKMEANER:
Oh, you running?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
WOMAN #3:
Who called me a bitch?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
So this is the message
you want to send

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And the bathroom stink.
Clean the fucking bathroom!

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
What's going on?
Oh, help me, son.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
You promise not to tell?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Help me, help me.
Come on.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
to the young youth
out here like myself

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
I promise.
I swear on your life.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Oh, my goodness,
some black people are crazy.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Huh?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm not gonna
take it anymore!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
just tryin' to
do the right thing

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I pay too much damn money
for these movie tickets

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh, yeah!
Here comes the pain.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Get your drunk ass
outta here.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
and not love
these ho's, huh?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
W-w-w-what's all this?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
You lyin'.
That's messed up, Granddad.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Oh! Ahhh!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Ahh!

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
to butter my own
motherfucking popcorn!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Is this what's hot
right now in the streets?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Damn it, boy!
Tell me who stole my car!

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Goodness gracious to life.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's only popcorn.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
That's what's
really hood, huh?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
How am I gonna get
my butter beans?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
What the fuck? My yard.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Tom, what's wrong with you?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
All for some white girl who
left you for an R&B dancing-ass,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Give me a little more time.
I'll get it out of him.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You on that stuff?
Snap out of it, Tom.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
sexy-flexy-
ass nigga?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
The officers have orders

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
When did you
get here?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
to take you both in
for questioning.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Cocaine's a hell of a drug.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Huh?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
You don't remember me?
You don't remember my name?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
911 emergency. I'll hold.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm sorry.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, I been at
the ticket window all day long,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
TOM:
And so, sweetie,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
that's why Daddy is

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Both of us?
I'm afraid so.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Uh, okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and I don't remember you
buying no ticket,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
staying over at
the Freemans' house.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Don't snitch, Granddad.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
So that's complaint
number 34457-dash-2,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Robert Freeman.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So Mommy can have
her space.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
They don't know nothin'
unless you tell 'em.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
What's my name, nigga?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Uh, I-I-I got my tickets
online.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Aha! A damn lie.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So you're not
getting a divorce?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
GRANDDAD: Damn it!
Damn it. Come here.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
regarding
excessive noise,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
"Ahhh" ain't my name.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I ain't never
met a nigga

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Oh, no, sweetie.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
MAN: Sir, please
release the child.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
My mama didn't name "Ahhh."

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
people walking around

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
smart enough to use
a personal computer.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
So Usher won't be
my new daddy?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Release the child.
TOM: You're choking him out!

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
What's my name, nigga?
What's my name?!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
where they don't
want them to be,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Not even a Macintosh.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
HUEY:  Ironically, despite the hip-hop community

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
eating outside

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
HUEY:
Stinkmeaner.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Uh...

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
What? No.
Th-- That's ridiculous.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
being the driving force

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
when they think they
should be inside at a table.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
behind the "stop snitching" movement,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
That's right, nigga.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You'll never take me alive,
you punk-asses.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. DuBois?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh. Are you sure?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
rappers tend to snitch on themselves a lot.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
RUCKUS:
Stop him!

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't know how
you got here, Stinkmeaner,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Come on, come on.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Uh-oh.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
He went this-a way.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Maybe just for
a little while?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
In 2000, rapper Gangstalicious reportedly assaulted

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
but you're going
back to hell.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You filed a complaint
against me, old man?!

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I mean, you like it here,
don't you, Daddy?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Oh, yeah!
I'm going back.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
You filed a complaint
against Thugnificent?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
This is a...

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
record executive Johnny Guinness

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And I'm taking y'all
with me

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
with a tennis racket

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Mm-hmm.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
pretty-good-sized room.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
in the first-class cabin
on the ass-whupping express.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
and a bottle of Hennessy on the set of a music video.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Fine.
It's on now.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't know what we're
gonna do, but we gotta do--

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
All aboard. Whoo-whoo!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Rap beef, nigga.
Punk-ass motherfucker.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Whew.
Did I miss anything?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Mr. Freeman...

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Shh.
Here he comes.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Guinness refused to cooperate with authorities.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Geritol nigga.
Bitch-ass nigga.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I don't wanna steal the movie.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Do something, nigga.
Man, fuck that.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Guys. I just
wanted to thank you

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I wanna go home!

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
But the next day,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Shh!

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Gangstalicious made an appearance on MTV's "TRL."

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
for letting me stay here.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
You ain't too nigga to get
that ass whupped. Uh-huh.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
What's wrong with you?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I know it's been
an inconvenience.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I wanna go home.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Hold up, hold up. Ugh, ugh.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Not at all, Tom.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You wasn't saying that
back at the house, was you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You take as much time
as you need.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Drop the beat,
drop the beat, ugh.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Was you? Because you wanted
to see  Soul Plane 2.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
my rhymes are too vicious

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Bring it on, Huey.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
mmm, delicious

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, this is how
we see  Soul Plane 2.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We gotta do
whatever it takes

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Thugnificent's rags-to-bitches story

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I repeat, the terrorist said
his name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
to get him the hell
up out of here.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
no doubt we gonna win this

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
took an unexpected turn recently

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Ooh. I got an idea.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
I smacked Johnny Guinness

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
when he moved into his first home

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
and he's demanding
that we --

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
GRANDDAD:
Hey, Tom.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
in the super-elite suburb of Woodcrest.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Tom. Get
down here.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I don't care what they say

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Hell, no, I ain't fitting to ask him

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
for his motherfucking autograph.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I hit 'em with the Hennessy

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
STINKMEANER:
Whoo, come on.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Come on, braids.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Several of the neighborhood's black residents

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
filed a complaint

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
HUEY: An hour into the movie,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Uh...what's goin' on, guys?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I wasn't sure how much more I could take.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
to have Thugnificent forced out of the neighborhood.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
MAN: We out of food, but we got

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
one bag of 'tato chips.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Let me ask you something.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
How did it make you feel

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yo. Look out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Pass this bag of potato chips around.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
HUEY:  Back at the neighborhood watch,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
knowing that this neighborhood's  black  residents

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Tom was facing an all-out revolt.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Please take one. Pass it...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Uh, Mr. DuBois,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
didn't want you here?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
TOM: Please, people!
Riley Freeman will talk.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Man, that hurt more than anything, you know?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
He's in here.
I know Robert.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
my name is
A Pimp Named Slickback.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
To be stabbed in the back by your own people?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
He don't miss a coon flick.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I assure you.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And this, sir,
is an intervention.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And for no reason? Man, we been good neighbors.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
What is it?
What's happening?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I say it's time

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
An intervention?
Your friends have

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
we officially militarize
the neighborhood watch!

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Superb, homey. Exemplary.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Shh. Don't make a sound.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
reason to believe
you are suffering

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I feel sorry for 'em, though,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
from chronic bitch
dependency, Mr. DuBois.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
MAN:
Yeah, that makes sense!

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
STINKMEANER:
All right, here we go.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
'cause they must have forgot

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
May I call you Tom?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
No! Everyone calm down!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
where they came from.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Is this some kind
of joke?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I promise you,
Riley will talk soon.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Is that all you got?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You don't know where I came from.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Tom...bitch dependency

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
:  Ooh.
Damn.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Do you even have a permit
for that gun?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm from a small town called

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
is no laughing matter.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Get a bar.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Let's go check Madea's Bat Mitzvah.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
whip a rapper's little narrow country ass. And you --

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Addiction to a bitch
can fuck with your friends,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Maybe I don't.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Get your bars up, nigga.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
MAN:  Attention, please, passengers.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Come and pry it from
my cold, dead hands...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Hey. Put that camera back over here.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
your health, and scary enough,
even your money.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
If you left the toilet seat up in the restroom...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I ain't finished my damn line.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
...faggot boy.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's a disease,
Tom.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And y'all are making me homesick.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
MAN: Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about!

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Wait. What was your name again?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
There, now stick that up your ass.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, thank you for asking.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Police knew granddad wasn't robbin' the houses.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Eat a dick, old man.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Officer,
I'm sorry.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
My name is
A Pimp Named Slickback.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
STINKMEANER: Whoa!
Yeah, I got you now.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
You fucking-ass, punk, old pussy-ass man.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I didn't mean to steal
from the stuntman.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Get off me, you bitch ass,
you faggot ass!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Wait. "A pimp"?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
What they didn't know was if he, like Riley,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
MACKTASTIC: Eat a sack of baby dicks,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
motherfucker.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Named Slickback.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
was withholding information.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes. Please say the whole
thing if you would.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Yo, welcome back, welcome back. It's your boy, T.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
GRANDDAD:
Not the lamp. No.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
What were you about to do?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes, that includes
the "A Pimp Named" part.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You were about to rat on us,
weren't you?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Damn it, boy. You know
how much that lamp cost?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Alright, let's get into something brand new,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
This is what the movie theater
industry wants, Jazmine.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
the club banger, "Eff Granddad" by my man --

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes, Tom.
Every time.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
STINKMEANER:
I'm a-kill you.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Us fighting against
each other.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Look, Mr. A Pimp Named
Slickback--

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
that's my boy, my friend, Thugnificent.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
You beat me
in the parking lot.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh-ho-ho-ho, no.
There's no turning back now.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
No need for the "mister."

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Now, you listen here,
you little bitch.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Not the vase. No!

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I-I don't think
I need any help

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
You know what it is. Fatman
scoop on the radio right here.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm gonna ask you
some real simple questions,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You're in it
all the way.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
from someone like you.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
STINKMEANER:
I want my parking space.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and I want some
real simple answers.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
New Thugnificent,
"Eff Granddad,"

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Now you're gonna get your little
narrow, high-yellow ass

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Boy, not the geisha. It's--
It's a collectable.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And by

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
the first dis record against
somebody's family member.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
back into the theater
and enjoy  Soul Plane 2.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
"someone like me,"

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Now, you pulled into the garage
and went into the house at 9:15?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
you mean a pimp?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
And it's got my main man,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I...wanna...go...home!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
A bad guy?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Nate "Doggity" Dogg, on the hook.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Uh, look, I'm not
trying to insult you.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yes, I believe.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
If I'm not mistaken,
it was 9:15.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
RILEY:
That's what you get,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
motherfucker.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Check it out.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Shut up.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I just don't approve of
what you people do to women.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You're ruining
my innocence!

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Shut up.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Ohh.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
So you pulled into the garage

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Punching me
in my stomach.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
MAN: I expected to fly first-class.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So I'm wrong.
So I'm messed up.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
and went into the house
at 9:15?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I wanna go home.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, which one of us is
the one missin' a bitch, Tom?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
MAN 2: Well, you ain't in first class.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
You don't see me running around
lookin' for a bitch.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah. N-Nine, yes.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Why we gotta put
the nigga in my bed?

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
I looked at my watch, and --
and, yes, mm-hm, mm, 9:15.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
GRANDDAD:
What the hell got into Tom?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I know where all
my bitches are,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Look at this.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
thank you very much.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
He's possessed
by the ghost of Stinkmeaner.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Granddad. What's wrong
with Jazmine?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Bitch, where you at?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
So you're telling me,
definitely,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Remember
the dream I had?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
that you pulled
into the garage

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
: I'm out here

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
gettin' your money.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Boy, don't nobody
listen to you.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Eat a dick, nigga!

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
and went into the house
at 8:15?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
My bed ain't
the only bed up in here.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
She's fine.
Watch the movie.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That's what the hell
I thought.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Should we take him
to the doctor?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Thank you, Grandma.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Y-Yes, that's --

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
What if he pees in the bed
or vomit, or shoots a deuce?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Now look at you: bitchless.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I believe it was 8:15.
Definitely.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Look at this.
I...wanna...go...home.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
"Sans bitch," as the French
in France would say.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Now, you see something. You know
you done fucked up, right?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh, Lordy Lord, my date.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
HUEY: Granddad had to be stopped.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I've had enough.
I'm going back upstairs.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
HUEY:
Granddad,

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Tom is possessed
by an evil spirit

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm gonna put an end
to this...

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Tom.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
GRANDDAD:
No! I said, no.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Tom, when we first
let you stay here,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
or die trying.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
and just tried to kill us.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I said I pulled
into the garage at --

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Lives are at stake.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
HUEY: And so did this movie.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
we thought it was only
gonna be temporary. But damn.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Fortunately, I thought of a way to do both.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Tom, I just don't see
any end in sight.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
You know you done
fucked up, right?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
It's only been
two days.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
No, I said-- Wait a minute.
I told you I pulled into...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Coming.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Nigga, hush. You're living
under my roof now.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Move, nigga.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Where you going?
They're looking for us.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
You're gonna get
some help.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
But without Riley talking, the cops had nothing,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You know what?
I know a great therapist.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Huey, come back.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I'll make an appointment
today.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
and Riley wasn't talking.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
That...

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, this is crazy.
Colored folks are something.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
also would have been
a good idea, but...

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
RILEY: I know y'all seen niggas
with spinning rims, right?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Well, hello, cutie pie.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
But check it,
check it, check it.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Snitch.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
we've already paid
Mr. A Pimp Named Slickback

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm sayin',
on a bike, though.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, hello.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
a retainer of $2500.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And then, like, when I pop a
wheelie. Know what I mean?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
HUEY:  My plan was to get to the projector room

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Robert, you shouldn't have.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And that front wheel
be up off the ground,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and destroy the print of  Soul Plane.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
With your credit card.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
it keeps spinnin'.
Ooh, boy!

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Uh, sorry
about earlier.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Man, niggas...
Somebody get me out of here.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
A PIMP NAMED SLICKBACK:
Did you know

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
that scientists now believe

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I was rushing, and--

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh, I think men who are
comfortable with their bodies

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Heh-heh.
They just mad...

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
First, I had to go to the bathroom.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
that some people
are actually born

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
with a genetic
predisposition

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Before I shoot
this fucking kid.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
are very sexy,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
RILEY:
I be like, ugh! Ugh!

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
to bitch
dependency, Tom?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
especially men
with big round bellies.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
One problem black people have with snitching

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah. Soul, nigga. Uh.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And exactly when did you become
a relationship counselor?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Jazmine, you're missing
all the best parts.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
is that the police don't necessarily protect

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, sharing
this pimp knowledge

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Really?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm not watching
a stolen movie.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
those that come forward.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
And I like to cook,
mostly pork.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
for an exorbitant fee
is my way of giving

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Take the case of Bernard Jefferson,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, well.
If you don't wanna laugh.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
something back
to the community, Tom.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
who helped the police shut down a local crack house.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I like to clean too.
Wow.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I want to help you,
Tom. I do.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
-Hey, you did the right thing.
-So, um, do you think

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.
What's so funny?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
You're not a man, are you?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
But I need you to
help me...

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, nothing. Hilarity
just ensued, that's all.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I might need some protection
or something?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
It did?

14:21.000 --> 14:21.000
help you.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, that's more
the feds' thing.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Huh.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
"Help me help you."
Yeah, okay.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Uh, you'll be fine.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You see anything weird,
you just give us a call,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh. Oh. Oh!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Now...tell me, if you would,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Robert Freeman!

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
all right, buddy?
Heh. Okay.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That was funny.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
about this bitch you have
an unhealthy dependency on.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Darling, all the women
of my cultu--

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
MAN: Hey, Bernard!
You snitch-ass motherfucker!

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Hm? Ah.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Could we please
not call her a bi-- Bi--?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
STINKMEANER:
Come here and fight like a man,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
you bad nigga!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Say it. "Bitch." Yeah.
Bitch.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Who is that?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Uh, yes, we've gotta
call her that, Tom.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
MAN: Shut the fuck up!
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I don't hear anything.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yo, that was crazy.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
RUCKUS:
It's about impossible

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
to find his black ass

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm sorry.
After what she's done,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Bernard lived, but when he refused

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
STINKMEANER:
I know you hear me, Robert!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
What in the hell was that?
Was that about me?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
in this dark theater.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
not callin' her a bitch
would be disrespectful to you.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I know you hear me!
Ain't this a bitch.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Man, tell me you didn't
think that was hot.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yo. I think we need
to shake the spizzot.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
to identify the men who shot him,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I will not be ignored!
Got a possessed nigga here,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Huh? What?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
And I'm not able
to do that.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
he was charged with conspiracy

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh, wait, wait.
Let me guess.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Now please continue,
Tom.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
and Granddad's
worried about a date.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
You gonna hate on it

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
and sentenced to a month in jail.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, my wife, Sarah--

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
just 'cause they was
talkin' about you.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
GRANDDAD: Can't believe
these little, young kids

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Get off me!
You got a date, Robert?!

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
You need to stop with
the hate crimes, granddad.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I mean-- She's the best
woman in the world.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Forget Jazmine. Let's go.
But we couldn't.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
out their damn mind.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Did you tell her that you got
two sets of genitals?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
That wasn't even me.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
She the weak link.
She'll slow us down.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Boy, get upstairs
and go to your room.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
That was that nigga
from  Friday,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We've had a great life
together until now.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
dressed like me.
I'll sue.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, how could we?
Look, she a little girl.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I'm gonna take me a nap,

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
A vagina and a coochie.
Oh, that's a conjunction.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You might wanna go over there
and talk to them

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
gonna drink me a Red Bull,
then I'm gonna wake up

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
before this gets outta hand.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
They're not gonna give her
no real time.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and beat you till
you decide to talk!

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You know what? Fuck them.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
She do what?
A couple months, tops.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I did everything I could,
but if Riley doesn't talk,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
What is going on?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
They can make all the silly
little videos they want.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
But we both got priors.
We gots to go.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh-- Oh, that?
That's just the television.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
When the council vote
on my complaint,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
they're both
gonna be charged tomorrow.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Come on, Granddad.
We running out of time.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Boys, turn
the television down!

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
they'll be out of
the neighborhood.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sometimes,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
STINKMEANER:
This ain't no TV show, nigga.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
This is real talk, nigga.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Dang, granddad. Heh.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
in order to save the day,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I always knew
you was a hater,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
people have to sacrifice
themselves,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
What the hell is wrong with you?
This ain't a movie, Riley.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
but I never thought
you'd be famous for it.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
you know what
I'm saying?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
My friends warned me that there
were weirdoes on MySpace.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You and Granddad
about to go to jail.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I can't snitch.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
GRANDDAD:
Wait, no. That's just the TV.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You're so brave

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
This person stole
from your family!

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
It's not the fact
that you obviously have a man

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
TOM:
Goodbye, Thugnificent.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
to sacrifice yourself
to save us.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I tried to stop 'em!

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
possessed by an evil spirit
strapped to a bed upstairs.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Tom.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Not me, bitch. You.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah. Hey.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh! Wait! Oh. Oh.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It's not?
No.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Oh, uh-- heh-heh.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
It's the fact
that you lied about it.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Hey, Robert.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
M-May I sit down
over there next to Riley?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
A PIMP NAMED SLICKBACK:
It sounds to me, Tom,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But, Tom, you filed
the complaint with me.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Huh?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
like some of
the passion

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah. Then I thought
about it,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
has gone out of
your marriage.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
What are you guys
talking about?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
STINKMEANER:
You better leave.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and I just went over there
and met the guys.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Hey. Hold this.
We be right back.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And perhaps you're not providing
enough excitement for her.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
: You've reached

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
the national headquarters

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And turns out
they're not so bad.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Okay.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Are you talking about
who's doing the break-ins?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
It's a normal thing
in long-term relationships.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
A little country,
maybe, you know.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
of the Catholic Church.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
If you know, you can tell  me.
I won't tell anybody.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
No one is available to take your call.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Exactly. See,
what Marx is saying

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And you can
help me fix it?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
If you would like to report sexual abuse--

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
They use the word "thar"
instead of "there."

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
is that the oppression
of the proletariat

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Hell no. I'm gonna help you
make that bitch behave.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
But, Tom. I thought
we were in this together.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Damn, there's got to be somebody
we can call for an exorcism.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
is an essential facet
of the exploitation

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
She wants excitement, she can
take her ass to the movies.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Jazmine, are you
wearing a wire?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
STINKMEANER:
You is a bitch!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
inherent in the system.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I know.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
So therefore,
due to the class --

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
JAZMINE:
Code blue, code blue!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Me, too.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
What the hell is this,
a snitch-athon?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Man, there's snitches
everywhere.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You little
half-and-half.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
They under the bed, too?
How about the closet?

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
This is...
really uncomfortable,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
so I'm just gonna
mosey.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Did you know that at least
75 percent of bitches

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Hey there, boys.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
May white God bless you,
Robert.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
suffer from some kind
of hearing loss?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Mm-hm.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I came as fast as I could.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
This alarming statistic
means that more likely than not,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Ooh, this is
uncomfortable.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So this is the plan...
Uncle Ruckus.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
HUEY: Oh, man.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
talking isn't
the most effective way

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
RUCKUS:
Let's get this party started.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
to communicate
with a bitch.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
ED: See, I'm what
they call "techno-savvy."

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Hello?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
He's in there.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That's when you
have to hit her.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
STINKMEANER:

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yo, this X.
Who's this?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You got bad credit, Robert!

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Uh, hey, there.
This is, uh, Granddad.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Whoa. What?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I fucks with the future.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What--? What happened
to my--?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You tell her what
you want her to do.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
RUCKUS:
Removing an evil-nigga spirit

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
from a Negro is

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, the problem is,
we don't live in the future, Ed.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Uh, you did some work
on my car?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
If she say, "No,"
hit the bitch. Simple.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
We live in the present.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
as hard as removing the stank
from a hunk of shit.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
You talking about the granddad
from the Thugnificent song?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
But I-- I couldn't
hit Sarah.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And in the present,
that shit looks ridiculous.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Damn.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I couldn't hit
any woman.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
It's not a cybernetic ear. It's
a fuckin' cellphone headset.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
We must use these tools
that the great God

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh-ho, shit.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Has not hittin' a bitch
been working?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Man, that's my shit right there.
Man, I love that song.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
He's right there!

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
The only thing you gonna do
with it is call a bitch.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
has given us
to fight niggas.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean,
scientifically speaking,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And unless the bitch
is a Martian,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
A whip, a noose,
a nightstick, a branding iron.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
has not hittin' the bitch
achieved the desired results?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
They roasted you.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Hey!

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
there ain't no explanation for
the shit to look that high-tech.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Man, how'd it go?
How'd that go?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
'cause your ass is old

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
No way. I just--

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Have you seen that shit
in the mirror?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
These things strike fear
into a nigga's heart.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I-- I-I can't. I-- I couldn't.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Man, they killed you.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You look like you're going to
a fuckin' comic-book convention.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, see, that's
actually why I'm calling.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Tom.
I won't.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
A job application.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Tom, Take a deep breath.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
-This the house?
-Yeah, man, this the house.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It's okay. People have phobias.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Avoid conversation
with the nigga.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
See, I'm gonna make
my own rap

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
STINKMEANER:
You ain't right, Robert.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
about Thugnificent
and embarrass him.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
GUARD: Yeah.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Some niggas can't
cross bridges,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
RUCKUS:
The nigga will lie.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
The nigga will make excuses.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Hey, yo. You never gonna
guess who on the phone.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Hold up, hold up.
I'm getting a call.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
you can't go upside
a bitch's head.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.
What's good, baby?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
He will use words
he don't really know.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And did you know that fool
parked cars on my yard?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Okay. We can beat this.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm gonna rap
about that, too.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Tom, this is
my bottom bitch,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Ed, ain't that one of your
grandfather's alarm systems?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
If he gets really desperate,
he may start to rap or dance.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
So, uh, XYZ, uh, whatever
your name is,

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Sweetest Taboo.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
-ED: Nah.
-Nigga, you sure?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
I was wondering
if you would be interested

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Now, she's gonna
help you learn how to

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It says, "Wuncler Security."

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
STINKMEANER:
You all, uh, testicles

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
and no shaft.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
in rapping with me
on this song?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
reestablish dominance
at home.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
See, I'll rap first, and you can
come in and rap second.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I ain't seen
no naked pictures, girl.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Send them to my Sidekick.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Ah, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But no curse words.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Hello. Heh.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
What happened
to your shaft?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Taboo will be playing
the role of your wife.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Damn it, Ed, get off
that fucking phone!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
And none of them crazy metaphors --

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
There's powerful niggadry
at work here.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
"Your breasts look like two mountains."

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Now, approach
Taboo,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I think we in the wr...

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
None of that garbage. Just stick to the point.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
grab her arm
firmly

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
RUCKUS: Ah...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and command her
to leave with you.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Who's there, huh?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Who in the hell are you?!

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
...wrong house.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Can you turn me up
in the headphones?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Nigga, my name is Reverend
Father Uncle Ruckus.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Sarah,
get your behind--

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Granddad, you're only
making things much, much worse.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I been waiting
on this day

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Stop, stop. Say "bitch."

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.
Motherfucker done shot me.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
No relation.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh, hush, boy. I can rap.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
since your little uppity ass
came into town.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
In the name
of white Jesus

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Do I have to call her
a bitch, really?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and all great white men
who have come thereafter,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Big Tank, please
make it hot, player.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Yes, Tom. You have to
call her a bitch.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
GRANDDAD: I don't get it.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
I command thy black nigga soul
back to the depths of hell.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, this rap go out
to Punknificent

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Trust me
on this one.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
You guys got elephant dollars.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I've done the research.
Now, try again.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Why your dumbass
robbing people?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and all his fans.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
'Cause I'm an American.
Shit.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It's the American way, man.
Shit.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Bitch, get
your behind--

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
never went to high school

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
You won't kill me, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Where the fuck was you raised?
A third-world country?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Is that all you got, nigga?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Ass.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, no, nigger.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
See, as I broke it down
to Ed, pops,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
That's just the tip
of this iceberg.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
mother fool

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You'll only die trying.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Bitch. Get your ass
in the car.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
if people don't have a need,
then there won't be no demand,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Read, nigga, read!

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Kiss my ass, you little-dick,
faggot motherfucker.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
so we out here creating the
demand, know what I'm sayin'?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
No!

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Or, uh, I'm, uh--

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
like Thugnificent

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Or...

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
If you was any kind of real man,
I wouldn't be here

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Turns out Ed and Rummy were breaking into homes

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Or I'm gonna die...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Whoa!

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
with Usher
in the first place!

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
as a way to stimulate sales for Wuncler's security service,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
trying.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Now, Robert, now.
Just hit him with anything.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This motherfucker
went YouTube?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What? What?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
You thought you was the only one

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Wait, hold on. I don't think
that's what Sarah would say.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
which was owned by Ed's grandfather.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
No, this nigga
didn't.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
who mastered the ancient
and deadly art of the nunchaku?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Come on, everybody join in.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's now tragically
obvious

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's really on now.
Oh, hell no.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The irony is, Granddad had already signed up

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Use your powerful hands.
This is gonna be funny.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that reasoning
with the bitch

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
This little fucking
bitch-ass, old-ass nigga.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
for Wuncler Security.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
is not
gonna work, Tom.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Let's whup
this nigga's ass.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Hey, yo,
word to mother--

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You have to
hit her.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And to add insult to injury, it didn't even work.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Repeat after me
the holy phrase:

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Hello?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I am an assistant district
attorney, for chrissake.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
nigga, get your black ass
outta here.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh, hey, hey,
Mom.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Heh. Well, now, y'all
get it right next time.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
What's --
What's going on, ma?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Tom...

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
you have to
get past this.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You know, the cost of
bullets are going up.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Nigga, get your black ass
outta here.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Ma...I ain't threaten
no old people.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
It's okay,
faggot...really.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
RUMMY: Sure, you're right.
Heh-heh-Heh.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
RUCKUS:
Yeah, take that

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
you black cricket.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
See, faggot? She just
gave you permission.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Come on, Ma. That ain't
even my style, Ma.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Hey, thanks for being
so cool about this, pops.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
outta here.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
This little old
dude, Ma. Just one.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Ah. My chin--
You see that?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
You all right with me.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Anyway, Granddad got his car back, and that was that.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Nigga, get your black ass
outta here.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Bitch is hittin' you.
All right, lady.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Ma, I really need to
call you back, please.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Okay-- Ow!

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
STINKMEANER:
I'm a-join in too.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
'Cause I do. Mom,
I'm in a meeting.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You're definitely allowed
by law to hit her now, Tom.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
It was a misunderstanding.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
out of here.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's self-defense.
I didn't do anything.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Mommy. Can I call you
back, please, Ma?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Okay?
Sweetest Taboo,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
you are in rare form.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Hey, Ed, give
your granddaddy my best.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Keep going!

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
outta here.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Oh, okay,
okay, cool.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I will. I'm gonna
call you back, Mommy.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
This isn't an exorcism,
it's a beating.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I love you, too.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
This is my state-of-the-art
surveillance center.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
They did it.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
There's very little difference.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Why does a pimp need
a surveillance center?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Cheers.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
outta here.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Hey, are we gonna fuck
this old-ass nigga up?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Here's 50.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Included in
your retainer fee

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah...

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah, you niggas ain't shit!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Now, you know, I don't hate old people.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is state-of-the-art
bitch surveillance.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah. There's no way.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Your mothers ain't shit.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It's just sometimes, you gotta let 'em know

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Come,  negro-san.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Quiet Storm here
has been monitoring

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Them ain't no negroes!
It couldn't be them.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
not to get it twisted.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
your wife's
conversations and e-mails.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
What the fuck
y'all looking at?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Just 'cause you lived a long life,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
don't mean it can't come to a short end, nigga.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Daddy, I've got transcripts
of all her conversations today.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
No charges were filed.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
HUEY: Several hours later,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
the exorcism of Tom DuBois

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
WOMAN: No way.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
No mention of Usher.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
had made no recognizable progress.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm hacking
into her e-mail now,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
ED: Nah, baby.
I-I'm not talking to you.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
What's up, world? This is Sway.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That was great, Granddad.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
but, tsk, this computer
is running a bit slow.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Is the nigga still in him?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Law-enforcement sources have confirmed

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Boy, I wish we could've seen
the end of that movie.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
As long as he's black
and breathing,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
that two Cleveland teens have been arrested

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't know.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Perhaps if we didn't
have dial-up.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
he's got nigga in him.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I feel bad for leaving Huey
and what's-her-name.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
for assaulting this man while reciting the lyrics

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Bitch, don't start
with that

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
They knew the risks.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So they might do
a little time.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
"we need another
computer" shit.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Ow!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
to Thugnificent's hit, "Eff Granddad."

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
You say that shit every time
a new iMac comes out.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
My bike!

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
GHOSTFACE: What the fuck is wrong

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
with you, Huey?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
We see 'em when they get out.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Uh...it doesn't seem right.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
You retarded? You gonna beat the man's brains in

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
One of the teens reportedly told police,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You ain't slick.
You better

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm going back
and turning myself in.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
make that G4 work,
bitch,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and what you gonna say to the cops?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
"I beat up old people because Thugnificent does it,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and stop playin'
with me.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Turn yourself--?
Man--

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
"Sorry, officer, we killed the nigga

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yes, Daddy.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
'cause he had a evil spirit"?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
and that makes it cool."

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Granddad, look, come on.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Ghost, it's late.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It wasn't the last incident.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I mean, I love Huey.
Almost like a brother.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Nothing in the e-mail.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Someone stole my bike.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Does she have
a MySpace page?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
RUMMY: Yo, Riley!

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Can you just tell me what to do,
so I can go to bed?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Recently, a rash of elderly assaults

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But what's done is done.
We got to let go of the past.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
MySpace?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Spinning, baby!

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I can't believe you haven't figured this shit out yet.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
attributed to the beef have broke out,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't think Sarah
would have a--

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Found it.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
including two in Lithuania and one in Tokyo.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If he don't come back,
can I have his side of the room?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Peace.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Huh.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Ed and Rummy
done stole my bike!

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Uh, since when did
she have a MySpace page?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
STINKMEANER:
You got imaginary friends?

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
The AARP announced a boycott of Thugnificent's record label.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Ah, come on, Granddad.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Man, niggas,
I can't stand them.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Peace? Peace? Peace.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
You know what her password
might be?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You supposed to be setting
a better example.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Um. Gosh-golly, we--
We usually use

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Stinkmeaner, you hate
black people, don't you?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
It's feared that the protest

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You just wait till
the manager gets here.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Stole my damn bike.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
could soon explode into more violence.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
each other's middle names
as passwords,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Hey, come back
and bring me back my bike.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I sure do.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He gonna throw the book
at both of y'all.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
so mine would be
Lancaster.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Man, Thugnificent ain't telling nobody

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That's L-A-N--
Got it.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
GRANDDAD:
What's that, boy?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I mean, I hate
everyone in general,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This  is
the worst day...

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
to beat up no old people.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Password is "Usher."
Here we go.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
but black people
especially.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't even really see how someone could even

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Nothin'.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
of my entire life.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Message to Usher.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Where's your bike?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And-- And, Ruckus,
you hate black people too.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
get something like that outta that song.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They're getting together
at 3:00

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Thugnificent is talking about

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I wouldn't exactly call them
people, but yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Told you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
at the Woodcrest
Chateau Hotel.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
what he's going through,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That's in an hour.
We have to go.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
so maybe a young person listening

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, I have a deep distaste
for Negroids.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I hope you got some insurance
on those spinners.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
won't have to go through the same shit.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Here's the guardian
for the kids.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
You have to take me!

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
You smell me? You know,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
people always wanna --

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's right,
Ruckus.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Tom, if you're not ready
to take control,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Right, right. And, Stinkmeaner,
I bet you hate rap music.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
We snuck
into the movie, too.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
RUMMY: Wheee!

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
then going there won't help.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
If you can call that old

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We?  You said you was gonna
turn  yourself  in.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I say let the bitch go.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Thank you
for not snitching!

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
stanky-booty
gorilla noise "music."

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
You know what I mean?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I paid you $2000,
and $500 as well.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Please. Let the kids go.
I'll take responsibility.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
ED: You stupid motherfucker!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Heh-heh. "Stanky-booty."

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
HUEY:

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
what started as a simple
disagreement between neighbors

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
I must say that's a brilliant
observation, 'Meaner.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Now, Tom, I hope
you can appreciate

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Look like y'all
all going down.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
has devolved into senseless,
ignorant, self-destructive

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
our no-refunds policy.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
HUEY: I had forgotten,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
a nigga moment

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
How about a complimentary date
with Sweetest Taboo?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
The manager's
not coming.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
cannot be resolved through violence.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
generational tribalism.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Cinema's closed
indefinitely.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
No, no, no.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But where there's harmony and peace--

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Fortunately, a robust exchange
of ideas has taken place,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Looks like everyone walked out.
Something about a union.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
You're still
on retainer,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and we're
going now.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
What? What's happening?!

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
and we are hopeful to having
a resolution shortly.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
What?
The manager ain't coming?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Ohh...

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
No! You tricked me.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Thank you.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, call the police.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Now the nigga can get
some bass in his voice.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
The FBI.
Homeland Security.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
--a nigga moment cannot exist.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, bitch. Let's go.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You mean,
we gonna let

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
He lets me whup him,
we can call it even.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
this African hooliganism
go unpunished?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
STINKMEANER:
No! You tricked me!

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
What's a nigga want?
Try to whup me.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Whup your ass,
nigga.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You have problems, Mr. Freeman,
and you need help.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm gonna get you eventually,
Robert.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You know who
you messin' with, nigga?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Thanks for coming back...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You hear me, nigga?!

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Would somebody here
please be an adult?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
eventually.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Yo, you need to stop
snitching, Granddad.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
You're neighbors.
You have to live together.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
THUGNIFICENT: Hey, man,
you know what?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Ah. Ow. Hey.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Somebody here
needs to be an adult.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Why don't you call
social services

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and turn yourself in
for child abuse?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
TOM:
There they are.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
We're neighbors.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
We have to learn
to live together.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah.
Exactly.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Exactly. That's
what I'm talking about.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Remember to hit the bitch.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
That's a really
grown-up way

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hey, man.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Right.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
:
Hey, guys.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
to look at it,
Thugnificent.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Thank you so much for
doing that. I mean, you guys

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
What are you doing here?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Not that I'm pole-jocking
or nothing.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
You guys unionized and staged
a walkout that quickly?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
just went above and beyond.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
RUCKUS:
Well, another nigga

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Hey, everybody good
in here? Beverages?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I mean, really--

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's amazing.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
successfully exorcised
and/or beaten.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, yeah.
We unionized.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Sarah.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I mean, bitch...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Then someone called
the corporate headquarters,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I'll send you
an invoice, Robert.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
What about you,
big guy? You good?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
and they shut down
the whole place.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
get your ass in the car.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Possessed or not,
you gonna fix my damn house.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Fired everybody.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Excuse me, Dolemite.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
You gonna have
another demon,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Well, um...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
it's gonna be my foot
up your ass.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Hey.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
power to the people?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
You heard me, beyotch.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Let me get that
for you, homey.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Fuck you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Why am I in Riley's bed?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Any of y'all
need a coaster?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Tom, please calm down

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
RILEY:
You know, that's

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
a real good question.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Let me go get y'all
these coasters right quick.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and let me go.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Why are you in my bed?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Now, old man,
we feel like

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
All the beds in this house

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, that's that.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
we been very courteous
neighbors.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
and I got the possessed nigga
in my bed.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Courteous. What about
the loud party?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
about stealing movies.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Ain't this a bitch?
Some old bullshit.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Nigga, you gave us permission
to have that party.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Buy the bootleg.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Hey, look, man,
I think you should calm down.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Or just download it
from the Internet

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
like everybody else.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Ah!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
That's not my signature.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The hell--?
TOM: You can't have my wife!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Hey, uh, I think
I'm gonna go

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Tom!

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
whip y'all up a little snack
or something.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Daddy. What did you do
to Usher?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Hey. Can you guys wait
here a sec?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Who's up
for guacamole?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I make some mean
guacamole --

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
There's something
I need to take care of.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Jazmine?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Well, what about parking
all those damn cars

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Daddy. Leave Usher alone.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
on my yard and
ruining my lawn?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
What are you doing?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Why are you trying
to kill Usher?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Man, how was we to know valet
was parking cars on your yard?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Niggas was
passed out by then.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Yes, Super Fly.
What did Usher ever do to you?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
We was fixing to
come over and apologize.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Jazmine wanted
to meet Usher.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
But then you had to go off
and start filing complaints

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
You're an animal.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and doing all that
old gay shit.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Is Usher okay?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
THUGNIFICENT:
And you know what hurts me

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
So you're not--?
No.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Is that you didn't respect us
enough as homeowners

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
GUARD: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Easy, boys.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
to just talk things out
in a neighborly fashion.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
That's a really
powerful sentiment

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Ow!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, nigga.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
TOM:
Oh, okay. I see what this is.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
you just expressed
right there, Thugnificent.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
SARAH:
Stop! Don't hurt him.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, what about all that stuff
in the video, huh?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Oh, nigga, that was
just entertainment.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You being real sensitive
right now, man.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, man. Anybody could see

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
He didn't
mean it.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
He was trying to hit me.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
that that was
a satirical ass-beating.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Tom!
TOM:

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I've never felt so much pain!

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Granddad, if you apologize
to Thugnificent

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm sorry, Usher!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
for filing
the complaint,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
then I'm sure,
Thugnificent,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
you will be willing to
apologize for the video.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
USHER:
Shut the fuck up,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Tom.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Hell, no, I ain't
apologizing, punk-ass nigga.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Kiss my ass,
old-ass nigga.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Please.
Stupid-ass--

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Can we at least agree,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
for the sake of
old people everywhere,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
that there will be
no more dis records?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Fine, whatever.
I spits hot fire.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'll eat your ass up
on the M-I-C,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
if you keep messing
with me.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
You gonna pay for
my lawn, boy.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Eat a dick, old nigga.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, you know, what  Rags to Bitches  means

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
is that there's more to life than what you're born into.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
There's also bitches.
