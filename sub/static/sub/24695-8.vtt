solely responsible

a new perspective.

My parents can't
afford it.

Desperate

03:48.170 --> 03:49.470

03:49.538 --> 03:52.939
- He's too drunk
to drive home.

03:53.007 --> 03:56.374

What do we got?

06:32.922 --> 06:34.723

06:34.757 --> 06:36.224
A body with multiple
contusions

06:36.292 --> 06:38.560
And lacerations on his face
consistent with

06:38.628 --> 06:40.359
A recent altercation.

06:40.427 --> 06:41.960
- Not from a fall
on these rocks?

06:42.027 --> 06:44.760
- No, most are diffuse
without any dermal tearing.

06:44.828 --> 06:46.794
I'm betting
he w killed up there

06:46.862 --> 06:49.630
Or somewhere else
and then tossed down here.

06:49.697 --> 06:51.831
- Right, and look at the bruises
on his knuckles.

06:51.899 --> 06:53.533
- Yeah, so he landed a few.

06:53.600 --> 06:58.170
Maybe get some dna
on the nail clippings.

06:58.238 --> 06:59.972
- Poor killer.

07:00.039 --> 07:01.773
- Poor killer?

07:01.841 --> 07:04.408
- His nickname,
killer o'doyle.

07:04.476 --> 07:05.776
He made the majors.

07:05.844 --> 07:08.047
Hit 48 home runs
his third season,

07:08.115 --> 07:09.515
Came to chicago on a trade,

07:09.582 --> 07:11.850
And they traded him down
to some canadian team.

07:11.918 --> 07:15.721
Then he was gone.

07:15.788 --> 07:19.223
- Let's go see
the widow o'doyle.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.358
[door shuts]

07:20.425 --> 07:21.459
Did he say where he was going?

07:21.527 --> 07:23.761
- Out.
- Did he say where?

07:23.829 --> 07:25.295
- He just said out.
- Uh-huh.

07:25.363 --> 07:27.499
Was he anxious or tense
or distraught?

07:27.566 --> 07:28.667
- No.

07:28.734 --> 07:30.401
- Whdidn't you
report him missing?

07:30.469 --> 07:32.503
- He disappeared for
a day or two before.

07:32.570 --> 07:34.137
He wasn't missing,
he just wasn't home.

07:34.205 --> 07:35.238
- Did he have any enemies?

07:35.305 --> 07:37.073
- None who would
want to killim.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.240
As far as I know.

07:38.308 --> 07:39.941
- Any affairs?

07:40.009 --> 07:42.076
- Uh, who knows?

07:42.144 --> 07:43.778
We haven been--

07:43.845 --> 07:46.246
Hadn't been real close
for a couple of years.

07:46.314 --> 07:47.581
- Did he owe money
to anybody?

07:47.648 --> 07:49.617
- Uh, everyone

07:49.685 --> 07:52.753
He was sucking wind,
officers.

07:52.821 --> 07:55.055
- So these are from his,
uh, biggest games, right?

07:55.122 --> 07:57.690
- He was very proud
of those bats.

07:57.758 --> 08:01.026
Probably the last thing
of any valuen this house.

08:01.094 --> 08:04.128
- Where were you last night,
mrs. O'doyle?

08:04.195 --> 08:05.696
- Me?

08:05.763 --> 08:07.698
[chuckles]

08:07.765 --> 08:09.032
Right. Of course, me.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.469
I'm not distraught enough
or overcome with grief.

08:12.536 --> 08:16.406
- We'll ask that of everyone
who saw him recently.

08:16.473 --> 08:19.074
- I was here.

08:19.142 --> 08:22.744
I did an hour on the treadmill
while I watched some tv.

08:22.812 --> 08:24.247
<i>Project runway</i>

08:24.314 --> 08:25.982
I used to be a model.

08:26.050 --> 08:28.285
That's me.

08:28.353 --> 08:29.987
- Can anybody verify
that you were home?

08:30.055 --> 08:32.256
- No. Yes.

08:32.323 --> 08:35.325
I spoke to my mother
on the phone.

08:35.393 --> 08:39.294
Look, detectives,
I'm bitter, okay?

08:39.363 --> 08:42.198
Bailey left us
in terrible financial straits.

08:42.265 --> 08:45.435
But he had no insurance
and no money.

08:45.502 --> 08:49.172
What I get from his death
is more grief.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.041
- Any idea where his car
might be?

08:57.080 --> 08:59.081
Mitenal inhe

09:01.118 --> 09:02.785
Nt
- I thought we were gonna meet
at the luncheon.

09:02.852 --> 09:06.355
- Bailey o'doyle is dead.

09:06.423 --> 09:09.558
I--I just heard it
on the car radio.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.893
I-I knew you'd wanna know.

09:11.961 --> 09:13.928
- No, I--

09:13.996 --> 09:16.229
What happened?
He didn't kill himself, did he?

09:16.297 --> 09:20.633
- No, he was found beaten
in promontory park.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.001
- Beaten?

09:23.069 --> 09:25.103
So it was a robbery?

09:25.170 --> 09:28.973
- The news didn't say much.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.041
It's been how many years
since we've seen bailey,

09:32.109 --> 09:35.078
Two years?

09:35.145 --> 09:37.847
- A while.

09:37.915 --> 09:39.915
Poor guy.

09:46.822 --> 09:48.024
Well, we have to go.

09:48.091 --> 09:49.959
Your father won't be happy
if we're late.

09:50.027 --> 09:53.062
- Of course.

09:53.130 --> 09:54.931
- So the search went out
on his car?

09:54.999 --> 09:56.199
- Mm-hmm.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.834
- And you checked
the unhappy wife's alibi.

09:57.901 --> 09:58.968
- The luds confirm
the calls

09:59.036 --> 10:00.736
And her mother veries
the conversations

10:00.804 --> 10:02.304
Within the apparent
time frame.

10:02.372 --> 10:04.339
I say we never count on moms.
- [chuckles]

10:04.407 --> 10:06.141
- Now I'm gonna go with
the statistics and say

10:06.208 --> 10:09.110
If this wasn't a robbery,
it was probably family.

10:09.178 --> 10:10.344
- Well,
I doubt it was the wife.

10:10.412 --> 10:12.546
The guy topped 200 pounds.
He was an athlete.

10:12.614 --> 10:13.981
And he had facial bruises

10:14.049 --> 10:15.551
Consistent with
an actual brawl.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.686
- Yeah, also there seems to be
no way that she gained, uh,

10:17.754 --> 10:19.088
From his death financially.

10:19.155 --> 10:20.255
- It's a marriage.

10:20.323 --> 10:22.124
Maybe she just got
sick of him.

10:22.192 --> 10:24.025
- [chuckles]

10:24.093 --> 10:26.560
What goes on in her hoe?

10:26.628 --> 10:28.529
- Whether suicide or homicide,

10:28.596 --> 10:30.864
The sport and the city
lost aell-loved

10:30.932 --> 10:32.365
And once-revered hero.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.133
- Ever go to his steak house?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.534
Whatever happened
to that place?

10:35.602 --> 10:36.702
I mean, there was always

10:36.769 --> 10:38.337
Some celebrity
hanging out there.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.173
It was great.

10:40.241 --> 10:41.675
- A real shame.

10:41.743 --> 10:43.978
And now for this
weekend's football--

10:44.047 --> 10:45.447
- [chuckles]

10:45.515 --> 10:48.383
Everybody seems to be making
a nice recovery from grief.

10:48.450 --> 10:49.650
- He did have a friend.

10:49.718 --> 10:52.186
This guy ron robbins,
who stayed in the minors.

10:52.253 --> 10:53.620
- Where did he end up?

10:53.688 --> 10:56.189
- He's, uh, an assistant coach
on a minor league team

10:56.257 --> 10:57.690
In staten island.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.960
- Mm-hmm.
Staten island?

11:01.028 --> 11:04.262
- Enemies?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.463
No.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.532
Um, everybody loved bailey.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.700
I mean, come on.

11:08.768 --> 11:09.834
I mean, he started
e bailey's fund

11:09.902 --> 11:11.269
For the homeless b

11:11.337 --> 11:13.237
He was--

11:13.305 --> 11:15.006
He was a gem.

11:15.073 --> 11:16.340
- Did he mess around?

11:16.408 --> 11:17.475
- Ye, sure.

11:17.543 --> 11:20.011
I mean,
women were all over him.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.146
For a while, anyway.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.748
I mean, but once he hooked up
with lani,

11:22.816 --> 11:24.316
He w pretty solid.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.818
- When was the last time
you were in contact with him?

11:25.885 --> 11:29.087
- Up until last year,
when everything went sour.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.290
Investors pulled out,
he lost the steak house.

11:31.357 --> 11:35.260
- How come you guys
lost touch?

11:35.328 --> 11:38.096
- Honestly?

11:38.164 --> 11:41.400
He started hitting me up
for money.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.269
Seemed pretty desperate.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.507
- You think
denardi killed him?

11:48.574 --> 11:50.508
- Chris said he was fine
when he dropped him off.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.243
- Well, who then?

11:52.311 --> 11:54.111
I'm not saying it was
a bad thing.

11:54.179 --> 11:57.347
- Yeah, it was a bad thing,
but it had to stop.

11:57.415 --> 11:58.615
- If chris didn't do it,

11:58.683 --> 12:00.150
And I know I didn't do it--

12:00.217 --> 12:03.053
- Hey, I wasn't with him.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.655
- Greg, listen to me.

12:05.723 --> 12:07.857
No one is angry.

12:07.925 --> 12:10.159
We'll be your alibi.

12:10.227 --> 12:12.295
But we have to know.

12:12.362 --> 12:16.432
- Look, back off.
I didn't kill him.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.069
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

12:22.105 --> 12:24.840
- Okay, look.

12:24.908 --> 12:26.708
We're all upset.

12:26.776 --> 12:29.411
But we stick together
on this.

12:29.479 --> 12:32.413
They may arrest someone
before it even gets to us.

12:32.481 --> 12:35.683
But if they do come to us,

12:35.751 --> 12:38.619
We need to have
the same story.

12:38.687 --> 12:40.087
Come on.

12:40.155 --> 12:42.289
We've done this before.

12:42.357 --> 12:43.957
Right?

12:44.024 --> 12:47.659
Gotten our story straight.

12:50.057 --> 12:51.123
- Time of death,

12:51.191 --> 12:52.457
Sometime between midnight
and 3:00 a.M.

12:52.525 --> 12:54.489
B.A.C. Was twice the limit.

12:54.557 --> 12:57.656
Stomach contents include
nuts, pretzels.

12:57.723 --> 12:59.023
Bar mix.

12:59.091 --> 13:00.892
- Well, maybe death
was the aftermath

13:00.959 --> 13:02.226
Of a bar fight.

13:02.294 --> 13:04.528
- Maybe a loan shark?
We know he owed money.

13:04.596 --> 13:07.565
- Well, they only kill
as a last resort.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.567
I'm, uh--

13:09.634 --> 13:12.735
I'm sticking with
something personal.

13:12.803 --> 13:14.970
- Well, here's
the coup de grace.

13:15.038 --> 13:17.005
Massive skull fracture
and cerebral hemorrhage

13:17.073 --> 13:18.573
From a blunt object.

13:18.641 --> 13:20.675
Something with a smooth,
convex edge.

13:20.742 --> 13:23.077
- You're describing
a baseball bat.

13:23.145 --> 13:28.081
- A poetic ending to a life
writ large with a bat.

13:28.149 --> 13:29.382
- Personal.

13:29.449 --> 13:31.888
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's my take on it too.

13:31.955 --> 13:33.992
Jealous husband or boyfriend?

13:34.060 --> 13:35.661
Ballplayers,
they're infamous for--

13:35.729 --> 13:38.597
- But no letters or emails
to indicate romance.

13:38.664 --> 13:41.699
His hard drive is loaded with
visits to online poker sites.

13:41.767 --> 13:43.734
- A degenerate gambler.

13:43.801 --> 13:45.835
- Also, he had unpaid
business loans.

13:45.903 --> 13:48.337
Remember, uh,
bailey o'doyle's steak house?

13:48.404 --> 13:49.538
- Yeah.

13:49.605 --> 13:51.372
My brother-in-law
had a big birthday there.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.574
At one time,
that was the spot.

13:54.642 --> 13:56.576
Maybe there's mob money
in there.

13:56.643 --> 13:58.143
They favor baseball bats.

13:58.211 --> 13:59.878
- I'm checking with
the accountant for investors.

13:59.946 --> 14:00.979
- Okay.

14:01.046 --> 14:02.447
Oh, and I got
the requisite letter

14:02.515 --> 14:04.584
From the chief of ds,

14:04.652 --> 14:05.686
Who happens to be
a baseball fan.

14:05.753 --> 14:08.457
- Oh, suddenly everybody cares,
huh?

14:08.524 --> 14:09.625
- Well, when you're down,

14:09.692 --> 14:12.426
There's nothing like death
for a comeback.

14:12.494 --> 14:14.294
- Here you go.

14:14.362 --> 14:18.130
A list of investors
in bailey o'doyle's steak house.

14:18.198 --> 14:20.664
Three of them invested
$300,000.

14:20.732 --> 14:23.199
Two of those have surnames
of italian origin,

14:23.267 --> 14:25.435
But I don't think there's
a mob connection.

14:25.502 --> 14:27.369
None of the names
are in the oc database.

14:27.437 --> 14:29.805
But all three of them
are all linked to bailey

14:29.872 --> 14:31.039
In another way.

14:31.107 --> 14:32.240
- How is that?

14:32.308 --> 14:34.441
- They all went
to a private school with him,

14:34.509 --> 14:36.443
The silesian brothers
academy.

14:36.510 --> 14:37.977
One of them is now
dean of students

14:38.045 --> 14:40.080
At st. Victor's
in far rockaway.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.882
- And this guy denardi,

14:41.950 --> 14:43.751
He's a doctor
at webster general?

14:43.818 --> 14:44.918
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.986 --> 14:46.853
Head of cardiovascular
surgery.

14:46.921 --> 14:49.256
And--and greg foster
is someone called

14:49.324 --> 14:52.093
The staten island car king.

14:52.161 --> 14:53.962
- Oh. Right, right.

14:54.030 --> 14:55.364
The foster home

14:55.432 --> 14:56.667
âª for all your auto needs âª

14:56.734 --> 14:58.604
[phone rings]

14:58.671 --> 15:01.076
Just amazingly bad
tv commercials.

15:01.143 --> 15:02.714
Nichols.

15:02.781 --> 15:04.216
Uh-huh.

15:04.283 --> 15:06.084
Thank you.

15:06.152 --> 15:08.752
Uh, they found his car.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.091
- Ye
,I milytuw thy.

15:14.159 --> 15:16.293
T bu
last night.

15:16.361 --> 15:18.129
- That's so strange
'cause his, uh,

15:18.197 --> 15:19.998
Blood alcohol
was twice the limit.

15:20.066 --> 15:21.233
- I never saw the guy.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.400
And the way he parked,

15:22.468 --> 15:23.967
He probably was drunk
when he arrived.

15:24.034 --> 15:26.635
- Can we look at
the charge slips?

15:26.703 --> 15:28.603
- Yeah, sure.

15:28.671 --> 15:29.771
- At 11:00 p.M.,

15:29.838 --> 15:31.572
You pretty much just have
your regulars.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.742
There were some guys
I didn't know.

15:33.809 --> 15:37.581
A couple at the bar,
some at that back table.

15:37.648 --> 15:38.881
- Can you describe them?

15:38.949 --> 15:41.415
- The guys at the bar
were in work clothes.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.917
Dirty like, uh,
cement workers.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.619
The guys at the table,
just guys.

15:46.687 --> 15:48.954
- Any other patrons
who seemed to know him?

15:49.021 --> 15:50.755
- I didn't seen anything
like that.

15:50.823 --> 15:52.423
- So that's it.

15:52.491 --> 15:54.659
- There's these.

15:54.726 --> 15:57.895
Bailey's bills.
Ious.

15:57.962 --> 16:01.365
But I never hounded him,
I just let him drink.

16:01.433 --> 16:05.502
- You were
a hell of a friend.

16:05.570 --> 16:08.371
Well...

16:08.439 --> 16:11.639
You know,
bailey could have...

16:11.707 --> 16:13.173
Could've had the feeling
that this meeting was trouble

16:13.241 --> 16:14.407
Before he got here,

16:14.475 --> 16:18.274
So to muster his courage,
he--he drank.

16:18.342 --> 16:20.342
First he shows up drunk,

16:20.410 --> 16:21.976
Can't even park.

16:22.044 --> 16:23.544
Then he's met out here.

16:23.611 --> 16:25.044
You know,
never gets inside.

16:25.112 --> 16:26.712
What do you think?

16:26.780 --> 16:29.014
Nina, let's,
let's do tire tracks out here.

16:29.082 --> 16:31.650
- There's been
a lot of traffic.

16:31.718 --> 16:33.918
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

16:33.986 --> 16:35.586
Just do it.

16:35.654 --> 16:36.654
- Why would he leave
with someone

16:36.721 --> 16:38.455
He knows is gonna muscle him?

16:38.523 --> 16:41.092
- Yeah.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.731
Oh.

16:43.799 --> 16:47.173
Unless it's somebody
he knows and trusts,

16:47.241 --> 16:49.508
Like the staten island
car king.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.376
âª for all your auto needs âª

16:51.444 --> 16:53.445
- It's a shock.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.844
Although we hadn't
been close lately,

16:54.911 --> 16:56.510
We were very tight
in high school.

16:56.578 --> 16:59.846
He and I played
varsity baseball.

16:59.914 --> 17:02.048
- Oh, yeah?
Pretty handy with a bat?

17:02.115 --> 17:03.382
Are ya?

17:03.450 --> 17:05.250
- Who, me? No.

17:05.318 --> 17:06.617
I walked a lot.

17:06.685 --> 17:08.118
Small strike zone.

17:08.186 --> 17:09.820
Bailey was a slugger.

17:09.888 --> 17:12.690
I was so happy
when he made the majors.

17:12.758 --> 17:14.525
We went to every game.

17:14.592 --> 17:16.160
He spotted us club seats.

17:16.227 --> 17:17.560
- Club seats.

17:17.628 --> 17:19.762
Hey, no, uh, hot dog girls
and warm beer

17:19.829 --> 17:21.564
For bailey's friends.

17:21.632 --> 17:22.798
- Nope.

17:22.866 --> 17:24.599
And when his career tanked,
it hurt all of us.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.903
So we staked him
in his eating place.

17:27.970 --> 17:30.105
It was good at first.

17:30.172 --> 17:33.774
Then it was clear
we were gonna lose our shirts.

17:33.842 --> 17:35.042
We loved the guy,

17:35.110 --> 17:36.443
But he sucked
as a businessman.

17:36.511 --> 17:39.412
- So there was a falling out.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.814
- No. Not at all.

17:44.217 --> 17:48.253
- How did you hurt your hand,
mr. Foster?

17:48.321 --> 17:52.023
- My hand?
- Mm-hmm.

17:52.091 --> 17:53.758
- Ah.

17:53.826 --> 17:56.194
Pt cruiser with
a faulty hood latch.

18:00.999 --> 18:02.100
- We were supposed
to discuss a new venture

18:02.167 --> 18:03.935
He wanted us to invest in.

18:04.002 --> 18:06.037
He kept us waiting
45 minutes

18:06.104 --> 18:07.471
And showed up drunk.

18:07.539 --> 18:09.340
- What was his new venture?

18:09.407 --> 18:13.777
- Autographs.

18:13.845 --> 18:14.979
- Autographs?

18:15.046 --> 18:16.847
- A web thing.
Selling autographs online.

18:16.915 --> 18:19.717
I-chat with a player
or celebrity

18:19.785 --> 18:23.254
As they autograph
a picture, a jersey, a ball.

18:23.322 --> 18:24.589
Not a bad idea, actually,

18:24.656 --> 18:28.125
But bailey was not the guy
to pull it off.

18:28.193 --> 18:30.761
- Well,
these are not autographed.

18:30.829 --> 18:33.397
All these boys.

18:33.465 --> 18:34.799
Couldn't all be your children.

18:34.866 --> 18:36.667
- My wife and I were unable
to have children,

18:36.735 --> 18:40.571
And so, in a way,
I suppose they are ours.

18:40.639 --> 18:42.106
They're past winners
of the silesian brothers

18:42.173 --> 18:44.374
Academy thomas reynolds prize.

18:44.442 --> 18:48.979
Established by
my wife's father.

18:49.047 --> 18:53.383
- All good-looking boys.

18:55.086 --> 18:58.155
- I think so too.

19:03.693 --> 19:06.762
- Yep. I was in surgery.
What's going on?

19:06.830 --> 19:08.898
- Got it.
- Go. Let's go.

19:08.966 --> 19:10.866
- Next they'll be
at my house talking to my wife,

19:10.934 --> 19:12.335
And they'll talk
to you after that.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.103
- Well, before that happens,
I'm gonna speak to a lawyer.

19:14.171 --> 19:16.038
- No. We can't do that.

19:16.106 --> 19:17.339
None of us can.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.940
A lawyer will encourage
the one who hires him

19:19.008 --> 19:21.844
To cut a deal and give up
the other two.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.146
- Look,
I know I didn't kill him.

19:23.214 --> 19:24.815
- I know I didn't.

19:24.883 --> 19:26.384
But any of us
could be accused.

19:26.451 --> 19:29.588
We must stick together.

19:29.656 --> 19:32.958
Now I told them bailey
wanted us to...

19:33.026 --> 19:35.594
Invest in online autographs.

19:35.662 --> 19:37.395
Got it?
Online autographs.

19:37.463 --> 19:38.562
- Online autographs,
got it.

19:38.630 --> 19:39.830
- You sure?

19:39.897 --> 19:42.498
- Yes. It sounds legit.
Online autographs.

19:42.565 --> 19:43.798
I got it.

19:43.865 --> 19:45.266
- Hang in there.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.301
These are not
rocket scientists.

19:47.368 --> 19:51.938
You are far smarter
than they are.

19:52.005 --> 19:55.707
- It's a risk when you invest
in any restaurant or bar,

19:55.775 --> 19:58.509
But we went in
eyes wide open.

19:58.577 --> 20:01.744
- Did bailey still
owe you money?

20:01.812 --> 20:03.712
- To misquote
our former president, uh,

20:03.780 --> 20:07.515
"depends on what the definition
of the word 'owe' is."

20:07.583 --> 20:10.218
All the stuff that was sold,

20:10.285 --> 20:13.388
Uh, glasses, dishes,

20:13.456 --> 20:17.427
Liquor taps, stools,
et cetera.

20:17.495 --> 20:20.463
What he told us it was sold
for seemed less than

20:20.531 --> 20:22.998
What we believed
it was sold for.

20:23.066 --> 20:24.566
He was pissed
when we questioned him.

20:24.634 --> 20:26.801
- And so how did you leave it?

20:26.869 --> 20:29.936
- We got in our cars
and went home.

20:32.539 --> 20:34.439
What?

20:34.507 --> 20:36.508
- So you saw bailey
drive off?

20:39.110 --> 20:41.610
- No, actually.
I, uh...

20:41.678 --> 20:43.512
I left before he did.

20:43.580 --> 20:46.047
For all I know,
he went back in for a drink.

20:48.116 --> 20:51.654
- You've never been married,
have you, doctor?

20:51.722 --> 20:53.090
- No, why?

20:53.158 --> 20:55.599
- Those are the kinds of details
a married man gets straight

20:55.667 --> 20:58.435
Before he goes home
and lies to his wife.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.447
- Look at that--he's putting
a ball in the grave.

21:21.515 --> 21:23.183
- One player's homage
to another.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.018
- Check 'em out.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.286
These guys do everything
as a group.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.422
- Check out the wife.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.489
- Which one, the widow?

21:30.557 --> 21:33.225
- No, silvestri's.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.560
She seems more upset
than anyone.

21:34.628 --> 21:35.861
- That's interesting.

21:35.929 --> 21:37.229
You know, uh,

21:37.297 --> 21:41.233
That could have been
bailey's type. Huh.

21:42.969 --> 21:47.072
[chatting quietly]

21:47.140 --> 21:50.342
- That thing you did
with the ball,

21:50.409 --> 21:52.310
You know,
that was a nice touch.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.013
- Yeah, that was his first ball
he ever hit over the fence.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.348
Seems only a few of us
really cared about those things.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.219
You know lani,
she almost buried him

22:01.286 --> 22:03.120
Without his number 48 bat

22:03.188 --> 22:04.822
That he made his homer with.

22:04.889 --> 22:06.924
- Good thing
you reminded her.

22:06.991 --> 22:08.726
- At the funeral home,
she had him in this cheap suit.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.428
And I told her, "you know what,
you dress him right.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.163
Cap and everything."

22:12.231 --> 22:13.731
Then I checked to make sure
she did it.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.668
- That's what friends
are for.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.736
- Yeah.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.039
You take care now.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.241
- Hmm.

22:23.309 --> 22:26.311
You see
how mrs. Silvestri's grieving?

22:26.379 --> 22:29.915
You know what
that tells me?

22:29.982 --> 22:32.984
That she might
want to share.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.054
I'll buttonhole the dean.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.994
- So you were close
to bailey.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.963
- Yeah, thank you,
years ago.

22:44.031 --> 22:49.034
In fact, all of us
were once very close.

22:49.102 --> 22:52.905
So it was a lot like
a funeral we all attended

22:52.973 --> 22:55.274
22 years ago;
it's kind of gotten to me.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.876
- How did you all meet?

22:57.944 --> 22:59.211
- In high school.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.748
Uh, my brother
was friends with john,

23:02.816 --> 23:06.985
Greg, chris, and of course
poor bailey.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.054
They had this--
this silly club,

23:09.122 --> 23:10.555
The hard guys, and--

23:10.623 --> 23:12.024
- Excuse me,
but we should be going.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.025
This has been
a very emotional day for us.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.961
- That's why
I'd like to talk with your wife.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.496
- This is a tragedy.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.231
You have a murder to solve.

23:19.299 --> 23:22.401
Go solve it.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.805
- That went well.
- Mm.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.407
- Did you get anything?

23:28.474 --> 23:29.808
- They all belonged
to the same club

23:29.876 --> 23:31.609
And this was like a funeral
they all attended

23:31.677 --> 23:32.944
22 years ago.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.712
- Whose funeral?

23:34.780 --> 23:37.815
- That's when mr. Congeniality
came to the rescue.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.086
- 22 years ago.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.287
They would have been, what,
15?

23:43.355 --> 23:45.891
- 16, 17.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.659
- High school.

23:47.727 --> 23:51.462
A funeral,
high school buddies.

23:51.530 --> 23:55.132
I wonder who died.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.370
- I hated high school.

23:59.437 --> 24:00.704
- Yeah, not me.

24:00.772 --> 24:05.075
Upper west side,
the park, movies.

24:05.142 --> 24:08.778
At that time,
life was good.

24:11.148 --> 24:13.182
- Well, I went to
four different schools

24:13.250 --> 24:14.717
In three separate countries.

24:14.785 --> 24:16.352
I was always the new kid
in class.

24:16.419 --> 24:19.988
Ah, here's john silvestri.

24:20.056 --> 24:22.057
- Drama class.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.759
Who's that kid on the end?

24:23.827 --> 24:26.862
Looks like
a young tom cruise.

24:26.930 --> 24:29.598
- "thomas reynolds
and his sister anne,

24:29.665 --> 24:31.499
"and john silvestri
sailed the seas

24:31.567 --> 24:35.036
<i>In h.M.S. Pinafore."</i>

24:35.104 --> 24:37.972
- Tom reynolds.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.707
Tom reynolds prize.

24:39.775 --> 24:44.078
I was just reading
this yearbook,

24:44.146 --> 24:47.514
Which is for the year
following that one.

24:47.582 --> 24:51.418
Yeah. Look to whom
it's dedicated.

24:51.486 --> 24:54.187
- "in memoriam,
thomas reynolds."

24:54.255 --> 24:56.656
I'm guessing his was the funeral
anne silvestri mentioned

24:56.724 --> 24:59.726
That they all attended;
her brother.

25:03.063 --> 25:06.098
- Tom reynolds dies,

25:06.165 --> 25:10.435
Then silvestri marries
the sister.

25:10.503 --> 25:13.505
Let me see that book again.

25:25.952 --> 25:28.519
Looks like thomas reynolds
and john silvestri

25:28.587 --> 25:31.589
Were inseparable buddies.

25:36.261 --> 25:37.529
- Well,
since we have the date,

25:37.596 --> 25:40.665
Let's find out how he died.

25:40.733 --> 25:41.833
[typing on keyboard]

25:41.900 --> 25:43.901
- Tom reynolds drowns
in a lake,

25:43.969 --> 25:45.336
And a local newspaper
calls his death

25:45.404 --> 25:47.806
"a tragedy emblematic
of the destructive force

25:47.874 --> 25:50.742
Of alcohol on today's youth."

25:50.810 --> 25:52.878
- Yeah, his tox screen
had him over the legal limit.

25:52.946 --> 25:54.980
But...

25:55.048 --> 25:57.783
The real story is probably
in his witness statements.

25:57.851 --> 25:59.818
- Statements from greg foster,

25:59.886 --> 26:02.521
Chris denardi,
john silvestri,

26:02.589 --> 26:06.291
And the recently murdered
bailey o'doyle.

26:06.359 --> 26:10.395
- I imagine a tragedy like that
can have a bonding effect.

26:10.463 --> 26:11.797
- Yeah.

26:11.865 --> 26:14.866
And it's a major problem
if the bond ever falls apart.

26:16.936 --> 26:18.537
- So you think
they might have drowned this kid

26:18.604 --> 26:19.771
And lied about it.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.172
- How often do we see
three witness statements

26:21.240 --> 26:23.074
So neatly in sync?

26:23.142 --> 26:24.609
- Like these same guys
describing that last night

26:24.677 --> 26:26.044
With bailey o'doyle.

26:26.111 --> 26:28.146
- They're lying now.
They probably lied back then.

26:28.214 --> 26:30.815
- I wanna bring them in.
Together.

26:30.883 --> 26:32.317
- Well, how's that gonna work?

26:32.384 --> 26:34.786
They've already locked down
their story.

26:34.853 --> 26:35.853
What are you gonna do,
mix them up

26:35.921 --> 26:37.021
And see who cracks?

26:37.089 --> 26:38.423
- That's right.

26:38.490 --> 26:39.724
Every group has a dynamic,
there's always the leader.

26:39.792 --> 26:41.159
He's gonna be
the least remorseful,

26:41.226 --> 26:42.359
Have less guilt
than the others.

26:42.427 --> 26:43.894
- Whoever that figure was
in high school

26:43.962 --> 26:45.395
Is probably
in the same position now.

26:45.463 --> 26:46.763
- It's gotta be silvestri.

26:46.831 --> 26:51.168
And the weakest is whoever feels
the most remorse and fear.

26:59.611 --> 27:01.711
- What?

27:01.779 --> 27:02.879
- Greg, I don't know
what to do.

27:02.947 --> 27:05.115
- What do you mean?

27:05.182 --> 27:07.450
- At the funeral,
they were harassing anne.

27:07.518 --> 27:10.553
- But you never told her
anything about this

27:10.621 --> 27:12.322
Or about--
- of course not.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.723
But the gist is
they're definitely

27:13.791 --> 27:16.393
Building a case
against you.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.627
Somehow they've got you
with bailey

27:17.695 --> 27:18.762
At the time of the murder.

27:18.829 --> 27:20.063
- How could they have that?

27:20.131 --> 27:22.365
- I don't know,
but it's what they told anne.

27:24.134 --> 27:25.968
The cuts on your hands
from fighting with him,

27:26.036 --> 27:30.806
That must be how
they got your dna.

27:30.874 --> 27:33.643
- Look, I may need
a top attorney.

27:33.710 --> 27:36.178
I don't have the money
for that.

27:36.246 --> 27:37.980
- But I can't help you.
- But you're not going broke.

27:38.048 --> 27:39.982
You married money.

27:40.050 --> 27:43.318
Tom's death worked out
for you.

27:43.386 --> 27:44.786
- I'm just stating
a simple fact.

27:44.854 --> 27:46.822
To get through this,
we can't be involved--

27:46.890 --> 27:48.791
- Wait, when you said
we're in this together,

27:48.858 --> 27:50.893
That we'd stick together--

27:50.961 --> 27:52.161
- Greg, we know you did it.

27:52.229 --> 27:54.897
- Like hell.
Nobody's said that.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.799
- The others won't be
as frank as I'm being.

27:56.866 --> 27:59.802
But you know you did it.

27:59.869 --> 28:00.903
Just like with tom.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.504
- Reynolds?

28:02.572 --> 28:03.639
- You pushed him.

28:03.706 --> 28:05.040
You pushed him in the river.

28:05.108 --> 28:06.775
- That's crazy.
We all pushed him.

28:06.843 --> 28:08.644
- That's not how
I remember it.

28:08.711 --> 28:12.247
Or how denardi remembers it.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.149
You beat bailey and then
followed him home.

28:14.217 --> 28:17.486
- So you and denardi decided
that I go under the bus.

28:17.553 --> 28:19.087
- We would have to testify

28:19.155 --> 28:20.322
That you've always
had anger issues.

28:20.389 --> 28:24.626
- I'm not going down for this,
you bastard.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.838
[sniffling]

28:35.906 --> 28:37.473
Deirdre.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.875
Hold my calls.

28:38.943 --> 28:40.176
- Yes, sir.

29:13.964 --> 29:15.198
- No sign of struggle.

29:15.265 --> 29:17.334
No reason to believe
it wasn't self-inflicted.

29:17.401 --> 29:18.670
- Who found him?

29:18.738 --> 29:19.804
Secretary.

29:19.872 --> 29:22.040
Heard the shot, ran in,
and passed out.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.843
- And no one went
in or out before the shooting.

29:24.911 --> 29:26.144
- From the secretary's desk,

29:26.212 --> 29:27.645
No one could enter
without being seen.

29:27.712 --> 29:29.113
- I'd still like
the remaining members

29:29.181 --> 29:30.714
Of the hard guys brought in.

29:30.782 --> 29:33.517
We'd start with denardi,
thweakest remaining link.

29:33.585 --> 29:35.018
With the right push
he'll fold,

29:35.086 --> 29:36.419
Or at least look like
he's folded.

29:36.486 --> 29:38.119
- And then silvestri comes in
and sees him

29:38.187 --> 29:40.155
D doesn't know
what's been said.

29:40.223 --> 29:41.991
Good.

29:46.129 --> 29:49.864
- And then there were two.

29:49.931 --> 29:51.031
- I don't follow.

29:51.099 --> 29:53.032
- 22 years ago,
there were five of you.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.600
Three days ago,
there were four,

29:54.668 --> 29:55.768
Yesterday three.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.740
I'd be a little nervous.

29:58.808 --> 30:00.678
- Poor greg was clearly
your man

30:00.746 --> 30:02.780
For the death
of bailey o'doyle.

30:02.847 --> 30:06.116
In the interest of decency,
the case should be closed.

30:06.183 --> 30:07.651
- But wouldn't something
that might have driven greg

30:07.718 --> 30:10.490
To murder equally
compel you to murder?

30:10.557 --> 30:13.592
- I think the ghost
of tom reynolds

30:13.660 --> 30:17.028
Is haunting all of you.

30:17.096 --> 30:21.932
Long-simmering...Guilt.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.067
- We all got drunk,
tom got drunker.

30:24.134 --> 30:26.602
He did something stupid,
we couldn't stop him.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.136
- You didn't
encourage him to swim

30:28.204 --> 30:29.304
In a freezing-cold river?

30:29.372 --> 30:31.372
- All right, look.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.942
We should have jumped on him,
held him down.

30:35.010 --> 30:36.510
It broke our hearts,
but you can't say

30:36.578 --> 30:39.579
We were responsible.

30:42.615 --> 30:44.716
- What's this?

30:44.783 --> 30:45.850
I agreed to be interviewed.

30:45.918 --> 30:47.651
No one ever said
dr. Denardi was here.

30:47.719 --> 30:50.054
- Does it make a difference?

30:50.121 --> 30:52.222
- No, it's fine.

30:52.290 --> 30:54.991
We'll get this over with.

30:55.059 --> 30:57.627
[door shuts]

30:57.695 --> 30:59.629
- We were just talking
about tom reynolds.

30:59.696 --> 31:01.063
- Tom?

31:01.131 --> 31:04.066
- Yeah, and the tragedy
of his death.

31:04.133 --> 31:06.868
Look at that picture.

31:06.936 --> 31:11.339
He looks sensitive
and sweet, gentle.

31:11.406 --> 31:13.073
What was he doing
mixing it up with the--

31:13.141 --> 31:14.241
What did you call yourselves?

31:14.309 --> 31:16.710
- Hard guys.

31:16.777 --> 31:17.911
- I don't see where
any of this is relevant

31:17.978 --> 31:18.911
To bailey's death.

31:18.979 --> 31:20.579
- Hard guys.

31:20.647 --> 31:22.981
I mean,
I know you were just kids,

31:23.049 --> 31:24.915
But you didn't catch
the double entendre?

31:24.983 --> 31:26.584
Hard guys.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.785
- Yes.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.220
We knew the double entendre
and we liked it.

31:29.287 --> 31:30.921
What of it?

31:30.989 --> 31:34.525
- Acting tough sometimes
is a reaction

31:34.593 --> 31:39.530
To feeling the tug
in the opposite direction.

31:39.598 --> 31:43.000
The feelings
that you felt for tom,

31:43.068 --> 31:45.903
Did they ever frighten you,
john?

31:45.971 --> 31:48.573
- Where this is headed,
I don't need to hear this.

31:48.641 --> 31:49.808
I'm out of here.

31:49.876 --> 31:51.310
- You'd really wanna leave us
with dr. Denardi

31:51.378 --> 31:53.312
And continue without y?

31:53.380 --> 31:55.448
- I warned you,
this is how they wk.

31:55.516 --> 31:56.615
We're under no oigation.

31:56.683 --> 31:57.850
We can just leave.

31:57.918 --> 32:01.020
- You and tom,
they've figured it out.

32:01.088 --> 32:03.056
- John's a control freak,
isn't he?

32:03.123 --> 32:05.457
Hasn't he always been?

32:05.525 --> 32:09.661
- Yeah, always wanted to be.

32:09.729 --> 32:11.295
- So tom reynolds dies
in some--

32:11.363 --> 32:12.931
- It was an accident.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.499
- But there's no reason
to fear openness

32:14.567 --> 32:15.901
About an accident.

32:15.969 --> 32:17.769
Unless if tom's death
were something else,

32:17.837 --> 32:21.239
Something very personal
between you and tom.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.508
Then it would weigh
especially heavily on you.

32:23.576 --> 32:24.676
- He married tom's sister.

32:24.744 --> 32:27.380
Was that maybe
an attempt to possess

32:27.448 --> 32:29.382
The last piece
of tom reynolds?

32:29.450 --> 32:31.117
- Or maybe simply
to love him

32:31.185 --> 32:35.487
The female form.

32:35.555 --> 32:38.758
I think that
you all trd to atone

32:38.825 --> 32:41.628
For that night.

32:41.696 --> 32:43.597
You, doctor,
you fix hearts.

32:43.665 --> 32:47.467
T isn't yours
still broken?

32:47.535 --> 32:52.005
We've udied
that old case.

32:52.073 --> 32:55.009
We know it wasn't ke
you told it.

33:05.252 --> 33:08.255
[all talking at once]

33:10.729 --> 33:14.098
- Maybe it's time, john.

33:14.165 --> 33:15.296
We have this ritual,
this--

33:15.364 --> 33:16.629
- Chris.

33:16.697 --> 33:19.330
- This initiation we did
if you wanted to ba hard guy.

33:19.398 --> 33:20.865
- All the way, reynolds.

33:20.932 --> 33:22.332
- Unh!

33:22.400 --> 33:23.700
- Move!

33:23.768 --> 33:26.101
- We all did it.

33:26.169 --> 33:28.401
We stripped and swam
the river and back.

33:28.469 --> 33:31.036
- In October, john.

33:31.104 --> 33:33.804
Not in February when we,
when we made tom do it.

33:33.871 --> 33:35.705
- Come on.
- Move, man.

33:35.773 --> 33:36.940
- Let's go over here.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

33:40.511 --> 33:42.645
- So, guys...

33:42.713 --> 33:44.514
I might not make it.

33:44.581 --> 33:46.082
- We all did it.
You'll do it.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.551
- Come on.
- What's going on?

33:47.619 --> 33:48.686
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

33:48.753 --> 33:51.155
- Come on.
- Go!

33:51.223 --> 33:53.858
- Whoo!
- Come on, let's move!

33:53.926 --> 33:55.259
[laughter]

33:55.327 --> 33:56.561
- We did it, all right,
detective?

33:56.628 --> 33:58.830
Uh...

33:58.897 --> 34:01.199
We killed tom reynolds.

34:01.266 --> 34:03.067
- Why are you doing this?

34:03.134 --> 34:07.003
- Because I am tired, john.

34:11.309 --> 34:14.444
He told us tom raped him

34:14.512 --> 34:17.112
While he was passed out
drunk.

34:17.181 --> 34:21.217
We got drunk,
we chased tom,

34:21.284 --> 34:23.119
We made him swim for it.

34:23.187 --> 34:26.188
- Two choices, reynolds!
- Oh, yeah!

34:26.255 --> 34:28.190
- Come on, let's go!
Come on!

34:28.257 --> 34:32.594
Man up, you wuss, man up!
- Come on, come on!

34:32.663 --> 34:35.899
- Help!
- Yeah, keep going, keep going!

34:35.933 --> 34:36.132
Or
- ai-I gott c
bac  comei gok, ple

34:36.132 --> 34:38.502
Co

34:38.570 --> 34:40.237
He
- ai-I gott c
bac  coplease!, ple

35:00.488 --> 35:02.789
- He wants to know,
john.

35:02.857 --> 35:05.292
Was it rape?

35:05.360 --> 35:08.829
Or was it consensual?

35:08.896 --> 35:11.298
- Under the law,
we committed no offense.

35:11.365 --> 35:13.233
- Get real.

35:13.300 --> 35:15.301
Bailey was about
to reveal the truth

35:15.369 --> 35:17.837
About tom reynolds,

35:17.905 --> 35:19.506
And it threatened
everything you are.

35:19.574 --> 35:22.142
- We all got emails
threatening that, but I swear,

35:22.210 --> 35:26.848
I did not kill bailey.

35:26.915 --> 35:29.484
We met in the parking lot.

35:29.552 --> 35:33.722
Bailey shows up drunk,
we had words.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.524
Foster starts beating him up,
but I stopped it.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.159
It wasn't right.
He was our buddy.

35:37.227 --> 35:38.460
Bailey was in no condition
to drive,

35:38.528 --> 35:40.429
So I drove him home.

35:40.497 --> 35:42.731
I told him,

35:42.799 --> 35:45.667
"don't screw with us,
bailey."

35:47.535 --> 35:52.369
He looked at me
so sadly.

35:52.437 --> 35:56.938
The last time I saw him,
he was there alone.

35:57.006 --> 35:58.805
- I'm done.

35:58.873 --> 36:00.604
I'm done.

36:00.672 --> 36:02.673
There's nothing
you can prove.

36:07.044 --> 36:10.380
Anne.

36:10.448 --> 36:12.882
Oh, god. Anne.

36:16.952 --> 36:18.486
I'm so sorry
they brought you here.

36:18.553 --> 36:20.187
I just wanted to spare you.

36:20.255 --> 36:24.857
- Spare me from knowing
what I have always felt?

36:24.925 --> 36:29.727
That you never desired me.

36:29.795 --> 36:32.596
Or from knowing what you did
to tom?

36:40.803 --> 36:42.237
- What happened in there
might bring closure

36:42.304 --> 36:44.638
To a 20-year-old tragedy,
but it doesn't solve our case.

36:44.706 --> 36:46.707
- Well, if one of them
had killed bailey,

36:46.774 --> 36:48.141
It would have surfaced
in that room.

36:48.209 --> 36:50.544
- Tom reynolds' death
still drives this.

36:50.611 --> 36:52.212
- But how?

36:52.279 --> 36:54.981
Who's blackmailing whom?

36:55.048 --> 36:57.250
- I'm wanna go
to staten island,

36:57.319 --> 37:01.187
Retrace bailey's
last movements.

37:05.425 --> 37:07.560
[ferry horn blows]

37:10.063 --> 37:12.532
- So you have a hunch that
you're not willing to share.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.070
- Well, it's still in
the formative phase.

37:15.138 --> 37:16.507
- Come on,
I promise not to laugh

37:16.575 --> 37:18.778
Even if it sounds dumb.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.480
- Okay.

37:20.548 --> 37:23.117
For guys bailey's age,

37:23.184 --> 37:27.558
Having a wife who doesn't care
puts him in a big club.

37:27.626 --> 37:29.027
Our captain said that.

37:29.095 --> 37:31.999
- Yes, she did.
I was there. And?

37:32.066 --> 37:34.169
- Her woman's intuition
might border

37:34.236 --> 37:38.707
On the preternatural.

37:38.775 --> 37:41.511
- Still in the formative phase,
right.

37:41.578 --> 37:43.513
So what's the deal
with staten island?

37:43.581 --> 37:45.648
- Manhattan has
the empire state building,

37:45.716 --> 37:47.650
The bronx has yankee stadium,

37:47.718 --> 37:50.586
Brooklyn, the bridge,
queens has the u.S. Open,

37:50.654 --> 37:53.890
Staten island has
a gigantic landfill.

37:53.958 --> 37:55.258
Can't you smell it yet?

37:55.326 --> 37:59.463
- I wondered what that was.

37:59.531 --> 38:03.402
So staten island's
known for its dump?

38:09.209 --> 38:11.076
- So let's see.

38:11.144 --> 38:14.146
I'm bailey.
Why don't I go into the home?

38:14.214 --> 38:18.384
- Your marriage is not
a place of refuge.

38:18.452 --> 38:21.321
- It's night.
She's up there.

38:21.389 --> 38:23.089
Hello, mrs. O'doyle.

38:23.157 --> 38:26.659
<i>Project runway,
I presume?</i>

38:26.727 --> 38:27.893
Yeah, he saw her up there,

38:27.961 --> 38:30.429
But he's down here
in a pool of light.

38:30.497 --> 38:33.498
Why does she say
she didn't see him?

38:38.638 --> 38:41.073
[doorbell rings]

38:41.141 --> 38:42.841
Hello, mrs. O'doyle.

38:42.909 --> 38:44.009
Uh, detective stevens,
detec--

38:44.077 --> 38:45.911
- I remember.
- Yeah.

38:45.978 --> 38:47.746
Uh, mrs. O'doyle.

38:47.813 --> 38:50.382
We were just, uh,
spitballing out here.

38:50.450 --> 38:52.618
Um, if you've been
on your treadmill,

38:52.686 --> 38:53.920
Where you seem
to spend a whole,

38:53.987 --> 38:55.621
Whole lot of time,

38:55.689 --> 38:58.724
That night when
your husband arrived,

38:58.791 --> 39:00.325
You would have seen him
out your window.

39:00.393 --> 39:03.160
- I guess I took a break.

39:03.228 --> 39:05.462
- Oh.

39:05.529 --> 39:10.165
Mind if we, uh,
took a quick look around?

39:10.233 --> 39:12.934
- Why not?

39:13.002 --> 39:15.903
[door closes]

39:15.971 --> 39:20.472
I got some of my old
layouts out of storage.

39:20.540 --> 39:23.106
- Yep, one's missing.

39:23.173 --> 39:25.704
- Got buried with bailey.
His favorite.

39:25.772 --> 39:28.070
- Which one was that?

39:28.138 --> 39:29.533
- Number 48, I think.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.033
- Yes.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.397
- And you looked out
and saw bailey

39:32.465 --> 39:33.630
All defeated and beaten up.

39:33.698 --> 39:37.266
What'd that
make you think, lani?

39:37.334 --> 39:40.536
- If I had seen him,
I might have thought

39:40.603 --> 39:43.138
How I was supposed to be living
in a brownstone

39:43.206 --> 39:45.206
On the upper west side, uh,

39:45.274 --> 39:47.075
How I couldn't stand
one more day

39:47.143 --> 39:48.710
Rotting in this stinking dump.

39:48.778 --> 39:50.513
- Wasn't he supposed to
get money from them?

39:50.580 --> 39:52.782
That was the plan.

39:52.850 --> 39:54.785
- He had no plan.

39:54.853 --> 39:57.689
- He must have told you
about tom reynolds' drowning.

39:57.757 --> 40:00.461
We know about the blackmail.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.129
- Uh, hey, whatever he did,

40:02.196 --> 40:04.430
I never saw
a nickel from it.

40:04.498 --> 40:06.132
- It's gotta be tough
when you marry a winner

40:06.200 --> 40:08.334
And things go sour.

40:08.401 --> 40:09.668
- Yeah.

40:09.736 --> 40:12.370
I was pissed about him
losing again and again.

40:12.438 --> 40:14.405
It's my right to be pissed
about that.

40:14.473 --> 40:16.274
- You saw him,
you knew he'd lost again.

40:16.341 --> 40:18.309
So you followed him
to the park,

40:18.377 --> 40:19.644
And swung for the fences.

40:19.712 --> 40:22.046
- You're crazy.

40:22.114 --> 40:23.280
You can't prove that.

40:23.348 --> 40:24.915
- I think I can.

40:24.983 --> 40:27.717
- He means we can exhume
the bat.

40:27.785 --> 40:29.352
His favorite is still
in the case,

40:29.420 --> 40:31.921
The one he hit
home run number 48 with.

40:31.989 --> 40:33.423
You picked the wrong bat.

40:33.491 --> 40:37.092
- I'm thinking that
when his teammate

40:37.160 --> 40:38.627
Got on you
for ignoring his wish,

40:38.695 --> 40:40.428
You picked the one
that you'd hit him with

40:40.496 --> 40:43.030
And buried him
with the evidence.

40:48.603 --> 40:51.071
- [sobs]

40:51.139 --> 40:54.207
Tom reynolds.

40:54.275 --> 40:57.377
Oh, why did I have to pay
for what happened to him?

40:57.445 --> 40:59.045
- Tom's death
was bailey's baggage.

40:59.113 --> 41:00.346
Made him hard to live with,
right?

41:00.414 --> 41:02.681
- It was why he kept failing.

41:02.749 --> 41:04.216
Guilt.

41:04.284 --> 41:06.618
He thought he deserved
to fail.

41:06.686 --> 41:09.086
I told him, I said,
"just prove you're a man.

41:09.154 --> 41:10.988
Get something back
for all the grief."

41:11.056 --> 41:13.389
- Threaten to go public,
ruin their lives.

41:13.457 --> 41:17.523
- With all they had,
they could have paid us easy.

41:19.891 --> 41:21.387
But no.

41:21.454 --> 41:24.884
Bailey just didn't have
the balls.

41:24.952 --> 41:28.720
And then I saw him
sitting out there, broken,

41:28.788 --> 41:32.756
And I knew he failed again,
and I just--

41:32.824 --> 41:35.825
I just lost it.

41:38.494 --> 41:41.495
[sniffling]

41:52.936 --> 41:54.370
- You gotta wonder,

41:54.437 --> 41:57.239
Without the ghost of
tom reynolds,

41:57.306 --> 41:58.406
Would they have made it?

41:58.474 --> 41:59.940
- I don't know.

42:00.008 --> 42:01.141
Picture a girl
in a ballpark,

42:01.209 --> 42:02.976
On her feet
in a cheering crowd,

42:03.044 --> 42:04.844
Thrilled when he puts one
over the fence.

42:04.912 --> 42:08.815
A hero, her hero.

42:08.883 --> 42:10.583
Then one day
he's just a guy on the couch

42:10.651 --> 42:11.718
Holding a can of beer

42:11.786 --> 42:13.887
While she sorts
his dirty laundry.

42:13.954 --> 42:18.191
- Moral:
Don't marry a sports hero?

42:18.258 --> 42:21.661
- Or a woman who will kill
to get off staten island.
