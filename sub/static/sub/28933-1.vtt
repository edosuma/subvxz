00:01.436 --> 00:03.264
Previously onInstinct...My name is

00:03.307 --> 00:06.919
Professor Dylan Reinhart.
Welcome to Intro to Psychopaths.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.878
Detective Elizabeth
Needham, NYPD.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.140
We're hoping your expertise

00:10.184 --> 00:11.837
can help us find out
who the killer is.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.103
You're not just some
boring old professor.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.148
You're CIA? Retired.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.237
Welcome to the team,
Mr. Reinhart.

00:20.281 --> 00:23.023
DYLAN: What, you can't
access sealed documents?That's why they're sealed.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.460
That's why I have friends.Don't tell me you need intel,

00:25.503 --> 00:26.983
and the NYPD
is slowing you down.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.724
LIZZIE: You're gonna be a great father.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.161
And child would be lucky
to have you and Andy

00:31.205 --> 00:32.728
as their dads.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.904
Just in case.If I were to call,
what would I call you?

00:34.947 --> 00:36.166
Julian.

00:36.210 --> 00:39.691
Was the evidence
in that live-streaming case

00:39.735 --> 00:40.997
properly obtained?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.955
You should not punish
Lizzie for my mistake.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.392
You should fire me.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.136
FUCCI:
Jogger found her.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.789
LIZZIE:
Whoever did this

00:50.833 --> 00:52.965
took the time
to make her look comfortable.

00:53.009 --> 00:55.185
FUCCI: Right after
he bashed her head in.

00:55.229 --> 00:58.058
Maybe he staged it this way
to throw us off.

00:58.101 --> 01:01.496
Or maybe they murdered her
and felt guilty after.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.063
Killer's remorse.

01:03.106 --> 01:06.762
Killer's remorse?
Don't get all intellecty on me.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.068
"Intellecty"?

01:08.111 --> 01:09.939
What are you,
Dr. Dylan Reinhart?

01:09.982 --> 01:12.724
While there are five major
psychiatric disorders,

01:12.768 --> 01:16.772
I think there should be
a sixth: happiness.

01:16.815 --> 01:19.253
Happiness
is statistically abnormal.

01:19.296 --> 01:22.473
Think about it, do you know
more happy people or unhappy?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.693
And what the hell
is happiness anyway?

01:24.736 --> 01:27.565
What makes me happy
may not make you happy.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.159
[beeps]

01:56.203 --> 01:58.509
[timer beeping]

02:14.221 --> 02:16.875
JUSTINE:
Hello? Hello? Who's there?

02:16.919 --> 02:18.486
Who's out there?

02:18.529 --> 02:21.141
I-I can't open this.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.490
Help me!

02:22.533 --> 02:25.449
Please, someone.

02:25.493 --> 02:28.191
It won't open.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.194
Help me! Please!

02:31.238 --> 02:33.327
[beeping rapidly]

02:38.767 --> 02:41.813
Dear old Epicurus may have
defined happiness

02:41.857 --> 02:45.295
as the supreme good, but he also
cautioned his followers

02:45.339 --> 02:47.950
that being happy ain't easy.

02:47.993 --> 02:52.302
Spoiler alert, life often sucks.

02:52.346 --> 02:55.697
Like you getting suspended
from the police department?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.525
Happens to the best of us.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.049
[camera clicks]

03:00.092 --> 03:01.137
You know, we
have people

03:01.181 --> 03:03.835
to take
crime scene photos.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.011
[sighs]

03:06.055 --> 03:08.884
FUCCI:
What are you thinking?

03:12.888 --> 03:14.150
Hey!

03:14.194 --> 03:16.500
Stop!

03:16.544 --> 03:18.807
[woman screams]

03:20.939 --> 03:21.897
LIZZIE:
Look out!

03:27.772 --> 03:29.861
Watch it!

03:30.949 --> 03:33.300
[tires screech]

03:35.867 --> 03:39.131
This would've been so much
easier if you'd just stayed put.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.267
Happiness means different things
to different people.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.270
Take narcissists.
Go ahead, take them. Ha ha.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.358
[laughter]

03:48.402 --> 03:49.664
Narcissists' self-esteem

03:49.707 --> 03:51.709
is based on being
better than you.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.016
So if you fail, they're happy.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.148
Do we have any narcissists
in this room?

03:56.192 --> 03:58.934
Oh, come on. I know
you're out there.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.762
More than six percent
of the population

04:00.805 --> 04:02.807
have Narcissistic
Personality Disorder.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.549
Jenny. Stand up.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.943
If you promise to speak honestly
with me,

04:07.986 --> 04:11.251
I will let you choose your grade
for this semester. Sound good?

04:11.294 --> 04:12.339
Deal.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.079
DYLAN: Okay. So
you can either

04:14.123 --> 04:18.780
have a B-plus
and everybody else gets an A,

04:18.823 --> 04:20.216
or you can have a B-minus,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.392
and everybody else gets a C.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.960
If I take the B-plus, I'll have
the lowest grade in the class?

04:25.003 --> 04:27.005
Uh-huh. But it's still a B-plus.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.355
Or you could have a B-minus,

04:28.398 --> 04:29.965
and all these slackers get a C.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.880
MAN:
Take the B-plus!

04:31.923 --> 04:33.229
B-minus, all the way.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.578
[students booing]Ha ha.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.058
Congratulations, Jenny,

04:36.101 --> 04:37.799
you are now top of the class,

04:37.842 --> 04:39.496
and subjectively happy.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.019
See you Thursday.
Thank you all very much.

04:41.063 --> 04:44.632
[applause]

04:46.286 --> 04:47.548
[indistinct chatter]

04:56.252 --> 04:58.341
FUCCI:
There you are.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.821
Way to go, Needham.
I'll take it from here.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.824
Couldn't have done
it without you.Sergeant Harris.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.478
Sarge, what's going on?

05:04.521 --> 05:07.132
Another body. Up there.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.570
FUCCI: And across the street
from our first victim.

05:09.613 --> 05:13.313
Looks like we've caught
a not-so-remorseful
spree killer.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.967
Come on. You're going to jail.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.712
[elevator bell dings][indistinct chatter]

05:21.756 --> 05:24.541
Oh, I'm here
to see Detective Needham.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.977
Thank you.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.808
No way, Reinhart.
You know the rules.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.071
Lieutenant Gooden forbade you
from all crime scenes.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.551
I know.
Nice to see you, too.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.248
LIZZIE:
Professor Psychopath.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.338
You can't be here, Lou's orders.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.208
HARRIS:
That's what I told him.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.383
He doesn't listen very well.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.559
I'll get rid of him.Here you go, Sarge.

05:47.825 --> 05:48.870
You coming?

05:48.913 --> 05:51.742
You're gonna get me
into trouble.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.658
Vic is Justine Crowley, 32,
a Steve Jobs-level genius

05:54.702 --> 05:57.313
who believed human immortality
is achievable.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.403
Perhaps motivated by
death anxiety, a fear of death,

06:00.447 --> 06:02.231
sometimes called
thanatophobia,

06:02.274 --> 06:04.189
not to be confused
with necrophobia,

06:04.233 --> 06:06.409
which is a fear of others
who are dead or dying.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.498
What do you call a fear
of dying from boredom?

06:08.542 --> 06:10.892
Um, thaasophobia.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.764
The vic started this business
to help people live longer.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.375
Uh, media called her Robo Boss.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.159
Apparently she remained
emotionally disconnected

06:17.202 --> 06:19.422
from her employees
and pretty much everyone.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.381
Oh, so you two have
something in common.

06:21.424 --> 06:25.254
Her husband saw the machine was
on when he arrived this morning,

06:25.297 --> 06:26.995
with a meditation stick
locking her in.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.518
He opened it
and found the vic inside.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.302
A cryotherapy chamber.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.043
Some believe it's
the fountain of youth.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.523
Ugh, a fountain that spits out

06:33.567 --> 06:36.613
nitrogen vapor at 200 degrees
below Fahrenheit,

06:36.657 --> 06:38.180
engulfing whoever's inside.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.487
On the plus side,
you'll look super.[chuckles]

06:40.530 --> 06:43.533
Maximum time is three minutes.

06:43.577 --> 06:44.578
We don't know
yet how long

06:44.621 --> 06:46.841
she was in there.
Possibly hours.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.799
Hey, hey.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.845
You don't have gloves on.

06:57.112 --> 07:01.072
We're processing the entire
staff, including her husband.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.466
Good, because whoever did this
clearly knew her.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.076
I'd say an inside job.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.469
LIZZIE:
Right.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.775
You follow your theories,

07:07.818 --> 07:08.863
and I'll stick to the facts.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.778
This was not a quick,
painless death.

07:10.821 --> 07:13.302
Her heart rate increased,

07:13.345 --> 07:16.610
violent shivering,
disorientation, frostbite.

07:16.653 --> 07:21.484
Whoever did this was angry
at her. Very angry.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.966
While she looks like that,

07:25.009 --> 07:26.924
the other victim
in the photograph you sent me

07:26.968 --> 07:28.404
was carefully laid out.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.972
The same mind could not have
executed both killings.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.974
Their proximity is a
coincidence, which means

07:33.017 --> 07:35.019
there is no spree killer,
and the Upper East Side is safe.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.368
So, lunch?

07:36.412 --> 07:38.849
This gentleman set up
Vim's security system.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.503
What is Reinhart
still doing here?

07:40.547 --> 07:41.896
Oh. He won't leave.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.985
Sergeant Harris, aren't
you just a little happy

07:44.028 --> 07:45.116
to see me?LIZZIE:
Detective Needham.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.988
Ian Bridgecroft,
Bridgecroft Security.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.511
Uh, you set up
the system here?

07:48.555 --> 07:51.253
Yeah. I don't know
how this could happen.

07:51.296 --> 07:54.082
My system is airtight,
with triple redundancies.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.954
Uh-huh. Uh, aside from
the Crowleys, your staff

07:56.998 --> 07:58.652
and the employees here at Vim,

07:58.695 --> 08:00.958
is there anyone else who would
know how to bypass your system?

08:01.002 --> 08:03.308
I created the system
so that couldn't happen.

08:03.352 --> 08:07.399
Everyone who has access is given
their own personal code.

08:07.443 --> 08:10.490
Okay.But I have my staff
double-checking everything.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.187
Okay. We'll be in touch.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.928
Okay.Thanks.

08:13.971 --> 08:17.061
Looks like an inside job.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.063
This is where you say
you were right,

08:19.107 --> 08:20.151
because you're always right,

08:20.195 --> 08:23.851
because you're
Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.417
Hello?

08:25.461 --> 08:28.333
Only a sadistic killer
would trap a woman

08:28.377 --> 08:30.684
in her own cryo chamber
so she freezes to death.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.776
But sadistic killers
like to watch

08:35.819 --> 08:38.256
their terrified
victim's reactions.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.563
It arouses them,
makes them feel godlike.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.739
This murderer
couldn't see her die.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.655
So what does that tell you?

08:45.699 --> 08:46.743
I'm not sure.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.484
But one killing
is never enough

08:48.528 --> 08:50.268
for a sadistic murderer.

08:50.312 --> 08:53.707
Whoever did this
will kill again.

♪

from each other,
on the same morning.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.336
And you're telling me
they're not connected?

09:14.379 --> 09:15.859
I don't believe so, no.

Road Runner's alibi checked out.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.124
He took off
because he broke parole,

09:20.168 --> 09:22.344
was afraid that
you might arrest him.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.737
See, that's why
I didn't sprint.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.566
'Cause I felt he was clean,
in here.

09:26.609 --> 09:27.741
I'm surprised you can
feel anything in there

with all that fried food
you eat.

On it. Gonna call the vic
Rip Van Winkle.

No, you're not.

to the frozen vic.Mm-hmm.

who had access to...

who had access
to Justine's office,

09:47.804 --> 09:49.980
and I'm speaking
with her husband soon.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.852
There's no kids,
but take a look at this.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.118
Throughout human existence,
religions have focused

09:57.161 --> 09:59.642
on what happens after we die.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.036
The afterlife.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.562
We have the ability
to extend human life

10:06.606 --> 10:08.303
for hundreds of years.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.435
But why stop there?

10:10.479 --> 10:12.263
There is no off button
on our phones,

10:12.307 --> 10:15.615
so why should we accept one
on our bodies?

10:15.658 --> 10:17.617
LIZZIE:
Ugh, is there

10:17.660 --> 10:19.619
an off button on our Internet?
It's worse than dialup.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.795
ZACK: Yeah, a Trojan horse
virus infected the network,

to slow down and crash.

Well, just get that tech wiz
with the ponytail

10:25.712 --> 10:27.714

10:35.983 --> 10:37.767
The wedding planning
is driving me nuts.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.030
I want to get married
before I kill him.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.945
The vic's husband
left the morgue.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.773
He's headed back

12:04.898 --> 12:06.290
I'm ready.
Speaking of ready,

12:06.334 --> 12:07.814
did you practice
what we went over?

12:07.857 --> 12:09.511
Of course I did.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.079
Well, it's only your job
on the line, right?

12:12.122 --> 12:14.298
And don't forget
to apologize.I did apologize.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.474
Your apologies aren't
really apologies.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.824
When you say "sorry," you try
and make the other person

12:17.867 --> 12:19.347
feel as if they should be
apologizing to you.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.088
Well, after all the crimes
I helped solve,

12:21.131 --> 12:22.132
Lieutenant Gooden should
be apologiz...

You should handle this

12:29.836 --> 12:31.838
Hard pass.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.404
Nice to finally
meet you, Andy.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.145
When I saw you walk in
I thought Dylan had

12:35.189 --> 12:36.581
brought his lawyer,
not his husband.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.801
Yeah, well, I'm, uh...
I'm both.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.281
I thought it might
be helpful

12:40.324 --> 12:41.761
to clarify some
of the finer points

12:41.804 --> 12:43.632
of Dylan's consultancy
contract,

12:43.675 --> 12:45.634
which you may not
even be aware of.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.331
But, uh, first...

12:50.813 --> 12:52.336
Um...

12:52.380 --> 12:54.686
I, um...

12:54.730 --> 12:56.427
I'm-I'm-I'm...

12:56.471 --> 12:58.429
I'm very-- I'm-I'm sorry.

12:58.473 --> 13:01.868
Give me a minute,
I'm all choked up.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.653
Dylan acknowledges
that he broke protocol

13:04.696 --> 13:07.264
on the Steampunk case,
and he completely understands

13:07.308 --> 13:08.788
that you cannot ignore
such a breach.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.833
I'm not about to let
a case fall apart

13:10.877 --> 13:12.748
because someone,
who's not even a cop,

13:12.792 --> 13:16.883
made some... let's
call them missteps.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.362
Or we could call them...

13:18.406 --> 13:21.844
The good news is that Dylan's...
missteps fall clearly

13:21.888 --> 13:24.194
under the legal safeguard
of inevitable discovery.

13:24.238 --> 13:27.023
His actions merely sped up
an investigative process

13:27.067 --> 13:28.851
while a gruesome murder
was unfolding.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.635
Dylan's expediency would
hold up in any court,

13:30.679 --> 13:32.855
and in no way endangers
a guilty verdict.

13:32.899 --> 13:36.163
Still, it's my team.
My responsibility.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.382
True, but Dylan's contract
isn't with you,

13:38.426 --> 13:39.557
or even with the NYPD.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.864
It's with the City
of New York.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.257
Dylan was the mayor's
hire, not yours,

13:43.300 --> 13:44.562
so the onus falls on her,

13:44.606 --> 13:47.696
not you.
[sighs]

13:49.089 --> 13:51.047
What's to say he won't
do this again?

13:57.097 --> 13:58.620
[Andy clears throat]

13:58.663 --> 13:59.664
Sorry.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.278
[clears throat]

14:04.321 --> 14:08.238
I will operate within
the NYPD rules.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.154
Dylan... I like you.

14:11.198 --> 14:14.331
And I respect how
stupid-smart you are.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
And I know how hard
your job is,

14:16.812 --> 14:18.292
and I respect how well
you do it.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.251
But, if I were
to let you return,

14:21.295 --> 14:23.340
you would fall
under my command,

14:23.384 --> 14:25.386
and you will follow
my rules.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.260
Justine was the most
incredible woman.

14:30.304 --> 14:33.002
She wanted to make a difference
in people's lives.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.352
She was my best friend.I'm so sorry.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.834
If I could ask you some
questions, it may help.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.923
Was it unusual
for Justine to get here

14:40.967 --> 14:42.142
so early in the morning?

14:42.185 --> 14:44.318
Justine's passion drove her.

14:44.361 --> 14:47.016
She felt like the idea of her
helping people live longer

14:47.060 --> 14:48.800
was why she was
put on Earth.

14:48.844 --> 14:49.801
You two worked together?

14:49.845 --> 14:51.542
I run our charitable
foundation.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.893
People say never work
with your spouse,

14:53.936 --> 14:56.460
but it made us closer.[door opens]

15:01.596 --> 15:03.511
Mr. Crowley,
this is Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

15:03.554 --> 15:04.947
He's, uh...

15:04.991 --> 15:06.514
Her partner.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.647
Your wife had a reputation

15:09.691 --> 15:12.868
of being emotionally
disconnected from her staff.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.001
Could that have led someone
to want to hurt her?

15:15.044 --> 15:16.176
Maybe in the past.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.221
What changed?
Justine did.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.962
Around a year ago,
she wasn't happy.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.661
She-she wanted people
to know her, not fear her.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.099
She wanted to have friends.
And she did it.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.623
That kind of change
doesn't come easily.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.842
Justine worked her
butt off to open up.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.801
Of all her accomplishments,

15:32.844 --> 15:35.760
that's what she was
most proud of.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.942
Thank God I told her every day
how much I loved her.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.948
Did he seem a little
too perfect?

15:48.991 --> 15:50.950
Why, because he
understood his wife?

15:50.993 --> 15:53.082
I think you're
identifying with Justine,

15:53.126 --> 15:55.302
someone who puts work
before everything else.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.913
He turned her from Robo
Boss to Mother Teresa.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.959
That's quite a gift.
And don't analyze me.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.221
You make it so easy.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.396
I'm not that transparent.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.006
Only because you don't
want anyone to see

16:04.050 --> 16:07.009
what's going on inside.Please stop making
me miss Fucci.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.969

it's Justine Crowley.

You can't be that driven,
that successful

16:12.275 --> 16:14.538
and change that quickly
without leaving a few

16:14.582 --> 16:17.367

in immortality dying so young?

if there was a struggle

16:29.118 --> 16:30.163
before she froze?

16:30.206 --> 16:31.425
Nope. The quick freezing

16:31.468 --> 16:32.426
would have prevented bruising.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.775
What about time of death?

She's glacial.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.647
I can't tell time of death.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.171
You can't hurry this along?

16:38.214 --> 16:39.781
Like, put her in a microwave?

16:39.824 --> 16:41.609
A "corpsicle" must be thawed

16:41.652 --> 16:43.741
under strictly
controlled conditions.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.352
A corpsicle?Otherwise,

16:45.395 --> 16:46.788
the surface areas
will decompose

16:46.831 --> 16:48.050
while the core is still ice.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.921
So you're just not
gonna do anything?

16:49.965 --> 16:52.576
What do you want me to do?
Oh, fun fact:

16:52.620 --> 16:54.404
the human body takes
five to seven days to thaw.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.450
Wow, that's really fun.

16:56.493 --> 16:59.496
How about hair or fiber
on her clothes, DNA, trace...

16:59.540 --> 17:01.846
You guys are really struggling
with the notion of frozen.

17:01.890 --> 17:04.327
Let it go. Let it go.

17:04.371 --> 17:07.113
Once the runoff starts,
I'll let you know.

The woman laid out
in the park, you know?

17:14.468 --> 17:16.513
The contorted position
she was found in

17:16.557 --> 17:19.429
may be due to burrowing,
uh, a protective posture

17:19.473 --> 17:21.431
she assumed before she died.She wasn't burrowing.

17:21.475 --> 17:22.693
Justine was a fighter.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.695
A female CEO.
If someone attacked her,

17:24.739 --> 17:26.610
she'd go at 'em

Look at that.
Just fell off.

Uh, let me pull up
her contacts.

20:34.494 --> 20:39.499
Oh, this NYPD network
keeps slowing to a crawl.

20:39.542 --> 20:42.763
Must be that Trojan glitch.
Ugh. Hang on.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.939
Uh, okay.

20:44.982 --> 20:48.595
Lots of B's.
No AB's yet.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.597
Is there a Dr. B?

20:50.640 --> 20:54.296
Uh, yes.
Dr. Alexandra Becker.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.255
Psychiatrist. Park Avenue.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.608
LIZZIE:
She sees patients

21:01.651 --> 21:03.392
at 11:00 p.m.?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.176
New York City, baby.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.614
24-hour restaurants,
drug stores. Why not shrinks?

21:07.657 --> 21:10.312
MAN:
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about, idiot.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.574
I don't even know
why I come here.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.011
You call yourself a doctor?
You're a moron!

21:22.672 --> 21:24.761
[door slams]

21:26.285 --> 21:27.677
Hi, come on in.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.291
It's late to be seeing patients.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.728
I work around
my patients' schedules.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.860
I was so sorry to hear
about Justine.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.906
She was an incredible woman.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.342
She was really
changing the world.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.126
She had a big chunk of her
calendar blocked off

21:42.170 --> 21:45.347
to see you earlier this week,
almost an entire day.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.089
With the type of clients I see,
all-day sessions do happen.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.220
What type of clients do you see?

21:49.264 --> 21:50.700
Psychiatric disorders.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.963
Anxiety, depression,
narcissism, trauma.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.314
I'm still not understanding

21:55.357 --> 21:57.968
why they would require
all-day sessions.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.188
I see a lot of CEOs, CFOs,

22:00.231 --> 22:01.842
leaders in their
respective fields.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.235
If they need me to clear
my schedule, I do it.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.629
Justine was making
real progress.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.631
Is that why she didn't have
any more appointments

22:08.675 --> 22:11.286
with you in her book
after that long day?

22:11.330 --> 22:14.202
I don't think that's why
Justine terminated treatment.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.116
DYLAN: Why do you think
she stopped?

22:16.596 --> 22:18.815
I believe her husband objected.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.818
Oh. Why?
He's not my
patient to diagnose.

22:21.862 --> 22:26.649
But I know that he was angry
at her for seeking help.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.608
I know he hated
her coming here.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.871
And they fought about it, a lot.

22:30.914 --> 22:34.396
Seems like he won that fight.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.535
Justine's history is clean.
Nothing to suggest

22:42.578 --> 22:44.537
that whoever killed her
was nursing an old wound.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.582
Which lines up
with Dr. Becker

22:46.626 --> 22:50.020
suggesting it could be
Justine's husband.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.719
Oh, sorry if my, uh,
trying to solve this case

22:52.762 --> 22:54.329
is interrupting
your texting.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.245
That's okay.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.334
You know, I was thinking, maybe
you should see Dr. Becker,

22:59.378 --> 23:00.988
being a narcissist yourself.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.511
I'm a narcissist?Oh, let's see,

23:02.555 --> 23:03.947
you think you're
smarter than everyone,

23:03.991 --> 23:05.427
you like telling
people what to do,

23:05.471 --> 23:07.124
you always have to dress
better than everybody...

23:07.168 --> 23:09.344
Wait, did you
stay up memorizing

23:09.388 --> 23:11.390
the top ten traits
of a narcissist?

23:11.433 --> 23:14.436
And you always have
to have the last word.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.181
No, I don't.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.791
Yeah, we fought about it.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.054
Do you know how much we paid
Becker in the last six months?

23:24.098 --> 23:26.056
Quarter million dollars.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.841
Therapy's a racket.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.712
That racket has helped
a lot of people.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.453
Maybe your wife was one of them.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.933
It was just the two of us.
Then all of a sudden,

23:32.976 --> 23:34.587
Justine's becoming dependent
on Dr. Becker?

23:34.630 --> 23:36.197
That's what shrinks do.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.633
Make you feel like
the only way to get happy

23:37.677 --> 23:39.069
is to keep lying on their couch.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.810
I thought you wanted her
to change.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.029
With my help.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.423
Becker controls her,
I'm on the outside,

23:44.466 --> 23:46.468
all for the low, low price
of 1,500 bucks an hour.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.470
Last question.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.081
Does Justine's estate
go to the foundation?

23:51.125 --> 23:55.085
No. It goes to me.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.478
LIZZIE:
Nothing was tampered with,

23:56.522 --> 23:58.262
and all of your staff
checked out.

23:58.306 --> 24:01.222
Glad to hear. I run deep
background before I hire anyone.

24:01.265 --> 24:04.791
I'm just curious, was it Mr.
or Mrs. Crowley who hired you?

24:04.834 --> 24:06.488
He didn't let her make any
decisions about the business.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.011
He said she needed
every ounce of her energy

24:08.055 --> 24:09.578
for being a genius.

24:09.622 --> 24:12.842
Guess they just did their own
thing, as far as I could tell.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.496
Thank you, Mr. Bridgecroft.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.498
HARRIS:
Hey, Needham.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.979
Every employee at Vim
Biotechnology Labs checks out.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.720
We're running out of suspects.

24:20.763 --> 24:21.982
Other than Mr. Crowley.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.462
Oh, and the computers
are back up.
Oh.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.377
ZACK: Fantasy baseball
draft is back on.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.771
Yay. Dude...

24:28.815 --> 24:30.817
I thought Travis was
on vacation.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.340
Who's the hero who fixed it?

24:32.383 --> 24:34.603
That guy.

24:34.647 --> 24:38.215
Lizzie, Dylan, meet Jules,
our new computer associate.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.869
Jules, this is
Detective Elizabeth Needham

24:39.913 --> 24:41.480
and Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.004
[Australian accent]:
Nice to meet you both.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.747
Oh, is this your desk?

24:47.790 --> 24:49.966
It is. If you don't mind, Jules.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.665
Not at all. Good as new.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.884
Great. Then I guess
you'll be on your way.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.625
Unfortunately, no.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.019
While the computer system is
up and running,

24:59.062 --> 25:01.238
the breach is much worse
than I initially thought.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.545
Not only did the spyware
infect the network,

25:03.589 --> 25:05.591
it's infiltrated
the entire server.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.331
How long will it take to fix it?

25:07.375 --> 25:10.509
Hard to say. A couple of weeks.
Maybe longer.

25:10.552 --> 25:13.076
I need to completely clean
the system's registry files

25:13.120 --> 25:15.035
and scan the network archive
so I can...I'm lost.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.558
Just fix it, please.Yes, miss.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.564
What's all this, Lieutenant?

25:22.608 --> 25:24.914
The DD-5s you'll
need to fill out.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.960
Part of our
"follow my rules" deal.

25:27.003 --> 25:30.572
What, I have to fill out
one of these every day?

25:30.616 --> 25:31.834
LIZZIE:
No. You got to fill out

25:31.878 --> 25:33.314
one of those
each thing you do, every day.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.663
Hard pass.

25:34.707 --> 25:37.231
Grandiose sense of
self-importance, entitlement...

25:39.233 --> 25:41.409
[quietly]: What the hell
are you doing here?

25:41.452 --> 25:42.758
[regular voice]: Coming
out of the shadows,

25:42.802 --> 25:44.543
and getting your
computers working.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.849
You do realize
you are putting me,

25:46.893 --> 25:48.851
a person who hates to lie,

25:48.895 --> 25:51.419
in the position
of having to lie every day.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.595
FUCCI: Man, I am really spinning
my wheels on this

25:53.639 --> 25:55.597
Ms. Van Winkle case.JASMINE: Still no.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.772
Who's this guy?

25:56.816 --> 25:58.034
Get out of my chair.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.427
ZACK: He's fixing
the computers.
Oh.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.777
Make yourself comfortable.
Come on, Doc. Some sicko

26:01.821 --> 26:03.518
crushes a woman's skull,

26:03.562 --> 26:05.346
then makes her look
all tucked-in cozy.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.739
I mean, that kind
of crazy is right

26:06.782 --> 26:08.915
in your psychopath sweet spot.
What do you think?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.482
I'd start with killer's remorse.Huh.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.310
This just came in
from the lab.

26:13.354 --> 26:16.139
DNA from Justine's husband was
found under her fingernails.

26:16.183 --> 26:19.621
Motive and evidence
of a fight. Let's go.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.624
Don't get too comfortable.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.539
FUCCI:
Computer guy.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.976
Can you help me
install Fortnite?

26:27.020 --> 26:30.763
What is Julian up to?
Was this your idea?

26:30.806 --> 26:33.113
Oh, sure, I was hoping
to spend more of my life

26:33.156 --> 26:34.375
watching you two flirt.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.203
It's not a big deal.Not a big deal?

26:36.246 --> 26:37.900
A former spy,

26:37.944 --> 26:40.337
who works off the
grid in some warlord,

26:40.381 --> 26:42.209
Masters of the Universe
dark web,

26:42.252 --> 26:44.733
just created a false backstory
to get himself hired,

26:44.777 --> 26:48.171
under an alias, by the NYPD,
as our homicide techie.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.695
Oh, and we're dating.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.653
Yes, okay, it is a big deal.
But it's his big deal

26:51.697 --> 26:53.307
and your big deal. That's why
I'm staying out of it.

26:53.350 --> 26:56.136
I don't like pretending.Oh, sure you do.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.312
It lets you two continue
without having to be vulnerable.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.096
Just keep keeping on
in your bubble.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.837
This should be
bothering you, too.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.970
You promised Jasmine that
you'd operate within the NYPD.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.755
Yes, but now that Julian
is working for the NYPD,

27:06.799 --> 27:09.584
he can be an asset
and I can still be a good boy.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.064
[clicks tongue]

27:13.066 --> 27:15.024
Hurt Justine?

27:15.068 --> 27:17.113
What the hell is wrong with you?DYLAN: Oh, well,

27:17.157 --> 27:19.333
it's a very long list,
but she has a thing

27:19.376 --> 27:20.595
about men who kill
their wives.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.336
LIZZIE: How do you
explain your blood

27:22.379 --> 27:23.946
under your wife's nails?

27:23.990 --> 27:25.339
I don't know.Really?

27:25.382 --> 27:27.471
You can't think of why
your blood would be there?

27:32.215 --> 27:35.349
Okay, look, this is gonna
sound crazy.

27:35.392 --> 27:39.788
Justine tested a new face cream
she was developing on me.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.355
It-it regenerates
a person's own blood

27:41.398 --> 27:44.010
to promote healthy activity
of skin cells.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.534
You rub your own blood
on your face?

27:46.577 --> 27:47.927
Where do you do this,
Transylvania?

27:47.970 --> 27:50.364
I know. I told you,
it sounds crazy,

27:50.407 --> 27:52.845
but it works, it-it fights aging
by replenishing the skin

27:52.888 --> 27:54.411
without the need of-of surgery,

27:54.455 --> 27:55.761
or needles.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.588
[sighs]
I will get you a sample.

27:57.632 --> 28:01.027
You will see
I'm telling the truth.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.377
If he is telling the truth,
there should only be blood

28:03.420 --> 28:04.726
under her fingernails,
no tissue.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.119
I'll call the M.E.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.207
[phone vibrating]

28:08.338 --> 28:10.079
Needham.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.082
We'll be right there.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.083
We got to go.What's up?

28:14.127 --> 28:15.737
There's another body,

28:15.781 --> 28:19.219
and you won't
believe who found it.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.834
Okay, take him.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.184
I got him.

28:31.622 --> 28:34.147
Oh, God, oh...LIZZIE: What happened?

28:34.190 --> 28:36.236
I arrived for a session,
I couldn't find him, and then,

28:36.279 --> 28:38.760
I-I tried to pull him out,
but it was too late.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.240
DYLAN: This is the same man
who was berating you

28:40.283 --> 28:42.068
in your office last night,
isn't it?

28:42.111 --> 28:43.547
BECKER: I know this
doesn't look good.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.636
Two people dead.
Both were your patients.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.726
You're right.
This does not look good.

28:54.907 --> 28:58.171
His name is Jonathan James.The Olympic swimmer?

28:58.214 --> 29:00.434
Now a coach. Jonathan needed
an emergency appointment.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.349
He was facedown in the pool
when I got here.

29:02.392 --> 29:05.439
An Olympic swimmer drowns
in his own pool. Wow.

29:05.482 --> 29:06.875
This has nothing to do with me.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.095
Oh, so the fact that he was
yelling at you yesterday

29:09.138 --> 29:10.270
is a mere coincidence?

29:10.313 --> 29:12.054
Jonathan was a perfectionist.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.795
It's why he was
such a successful swimmer

29:13.839 --> 29:15.579
and sought-after coach.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.451
He was also
short-tempered.

29:17.494 --> 29:18.626
We were
working on that.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.149
Why were you meeting him here?

29:20.193 --> 29:21.803
I make house calls
to VIP clients.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.892
You're a concierge psychiatrist?

29:23.936 --> 29:26.590
For clients who pay a retainer.
I go to them if they need me.

29:26.634 --> 29:27.940
I'd like to see
your session notes.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.550
I want
to help you, I do.

29:29.593 --> 29:30.769
But even in death,
that would be a breach

29:30.812 --> 29:32.335
of the physician-patient
privilege.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.728
Only a subpoena
would compel me

29:33.772 --> 29:35.599
to share my medical records.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.036
Then I'll go get one.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.605
I can't believe I didn't
recognize Jonathan James.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.172
I had a huge crush on him

29:43.216 --> 29:44.826
in the 2004 Olympics.Me, too.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.568
The only connection between him
and Justine is Dr. Becker.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.483
But I can't find a motive.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.485
And if it's not her,
why would Justine's husband

29:51.528 --> 29:54.096
kill the swim coach,
to frame Becker?

29:54.140 --> 29:56.055
Heard there was a second body.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.187
Are you engaging
in homicide gossip?

29:58.231 --> 30:00.842
Just water cooler chat.
This is a water cooler.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.278
Why are you here?

30:02.322 --> 30:04.106
To refill my water
at the water cooler.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.412
And to get some sunshine.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.066
Sun's bad for you.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.764
I've got some real work to do.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.336
[sniffs]

30:16.379 --> 30:18.425
Sesame or poppy.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.036
This is not Sophie's choice.

30:25.911 --> 30:29.305
You did not tell Lizzie about
the bang and burn, Jules?

30:29.349 --> 30:30.829
I don't want to put her at risk.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.308
The way she's looking at you,
just being here

30:32.352 --> 30:33.570
could put you at risk.

30:33.614 --> 30:34.658
Any idea who broke in?

30:34.702 --> 30:36.747
No. It was a professional.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.315
Want me to do
some counterintelligence?

30:39.359 --> 30:40.882
At least they won't
find you here.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.188
Well, I needed
a safe place to work,

30:42.231 --> 30:43.972
until I find a secure space.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.714
And I'm hoping the NYPD system
can help me get a lead,

30:46.757 --> 30:48.585
see who burned me.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.937
Dylan, I'll be careful.
And while I'm here,

30:51.980 --> 30:53.764
I can upgrade
your computer system.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.419
In fact, I must, since
I'm reduced to using it myself.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.465
It's a win-win.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.597
Almost like
we're partners again.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.904
Speaking of which,
I've done some digging,

31:02.948 --> 31:06.690
and that psychiatrist
is an upstanding citizen,

31:06.734 --> 31:08.344
with an impeccable record.I did not ask you to dig.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.911
You didn't have to.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.348
One of the perks of consulting
in the 11th Precinct.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.656
That, and free bagels.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.701
I've got to go and hack
into a Turkish strongman's

31:17.745 --> 31:20.139
Swiss bank account,
for my other job.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.837
M.E. called,
confirmed no epithelials

31:22.881 --> 31:24.360
were found
under Justine's nails.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.709
So if it's not the husband,

31:25.753 --> 31:27.537
and it's not the doctor...DYLAN: Then we are,

31:27.581 --> 31:28.756
as Detective Fucci would say,

31:28.799 --> 31:30.671
[imitates Fucci]:
chasing our tails around.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.107
Chase them to Laduree.
We have our double date
in less than an hour.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.587
LIZZIE:
Oh, I'm gonna be late.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.981
I have to wait for Dr. Becker's
records to be delivered.

31:36.024 --> 31:37.765
I've got some work to finish.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.810
I'll bring the records
to dinner.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.901
Great.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.163
[sighs]

31:44.206 --> 31:46.426
It's the least I can do.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.645
Since you're lying to her
about every reason you're here.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.910
You know the drill:
need to know.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.916
LIZZIE: Dylan tells me
you put on quite a show

31:57.959 --> 31:59.830
to get him back at work.Yes.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.311
I'm sorry that means you might
have to partner with him again.[laughs]

32:02.355 --> 32:05.227
DYLAN: Made him remember how
much he loves lawyering.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.621
It wasn't being a lawyer
that turned me off.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.928
It was doing it for a giant,
bloodsucking firm.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.625
Maybe you should do it again
without the bloodsucking.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.409
I was kind of thinking
the same thing.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.672
JULIAN:
Sorry I'm late, Dylan.

32:15.716 --> 32:19.676
Andy. Great to see you.
Lizzie.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.722
Thank you.The information you wanted
from Dr. Becker.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.465
To Dylan back at the NYPD.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.684
To Julian leaving
the NYPD.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.208
To Andy practicing
his kind of law.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.862
Show up ten minutes late
and you miss everything.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.344
DYLAN:
Let me help.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.694
MAN:
A reservation for 7:00 p.m.

32:37.738 --> 32:38.739
means 7:00 p.m.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.350
Not 7:05 or 7:15.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.873
You think I have time
to just wait around here?

32:42.917 --> 32:44.353
It's now my table.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.528
ANDY:
His table?

32:45.572 --> 32:47.095
God, I hate narcissists.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.141
Clearly, his time is more
important than the rest of us.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.707
Why kill two patients

32:50.751 --> 32:52.274
of the same doctor?

32:52.318 --> 32:54.407
What if Becker did help get
both our victims killed?

32:54.450 --> 32:56.278
She just didn't know it.Wine, anyone?

32:56.322 --> 32:59.281
Becker said one of her
specialties was narcissism.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.066
What if the person
we're looking for

33:01.109 --> 33:03.024
was enraged because
he had to wait,

33:03.068 --> 33:05.984
only he didn't just make a scene
in a restaurant, he killed?

33:06.027 --> 33:07.333
So you're thinking
the killer is a patient

33:07.376 --> 33:08.769
who's also a narcissist?

33:08.812 --> 33:10.379
Well, but
on a different level.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.772
A malignant narcissist.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.034
Someone with no empathy,

33:13.078 --> 33:15.036
the desire to
commit crimes

33:15.080 --> 33:17.865
and the grandiosity to think
he's entitled to do so

33:17.908 --> 33:19.998
with impunity.So, if our killer had
his times canceled

33:20.041 --> 33:21.129
because of another patient's
appointment...?

33:21.173 --> 33:23.131
Oh, for a malignant
narcissist,

33:23.175 --> 33:25.046
that would be a deep
injury to his self-esteem

33:25.090 --> 33:26.352
and could very well

33:26.395 --> 33:28.571
justify murder.But why kill the patients?

33:28.615 --> 33:30.704
Shouldn't he be angry
at the doctor?

33:30.747 --> 33:32.010
She canceled the sessions.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.707
Maybe he's trying
to frame her?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.535
If they feel wronged,
a malignant narcissist

33:35.578 --> 33:38.364
will scorch the earth
to get revenge.

33:38.407 --> 33:41.541
The victims infringed on the
killer's appointment times.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.282
They die first.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.719
Which means Becker
would be next.

33:45.762 --> 33:48.983
If both victims recently
had all-day sessions...

33:49.027 --> 33:51.551
That means other patients had
their appointments canceled.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.596
We need to see
who they were. Here.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.511
DYLAN: Oh, this is the diagnosis
code you're looking for.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.991
LIZZIE:
Here's one.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.558
And another.

33:58.601 --> 33:59.863
Another.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.083
I have four. That is seven
narcissistic patients.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.607
But only one name I recognize.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.611
And he's got
an appointment now

34:08.655 --> 34:10.309
at Dr. Becker's office.

34:10.352 --> 34:13.529
Sorry. See you later.See you later.

34:13.573 --> 34:16.054
We'll have to record
his confession.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.495
How is the sea bass?

34:33.114 --> 34:34.159
Let me talk to him.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.421
I think I can
get him to confess.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.597
You have two minutes,
then I'm coming in.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.576
What do you want?

35:00.620 --> 35:01.838
I have an appointment.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.579
This is my time.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.451
Tell Dr. Becker
Dylan Reinhart is here.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.366
She'll see me.
She knows who I am.

35:07.409 --> 35:11.718
You install her
security system, too?

35:13.937 --> 35:14.938
IAN:
Come on in, Dylan.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.288
Give me your gun.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.550
I'm here for therapy.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.595
Yeah. So am I.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.859
Cop thinks he's important.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.470
Why? 'Cause you got

35:24.513 --> 35:26.254
these fancy clothes?

35:26.298 --> 35:27.429
[whispering]:
I'm gonna help you.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.563
I killed two
of her patients.

35:30.606 --> 35:31.955
And that's just this week.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.435
She doesn't know about the rest.

35:33.479 --> 35:36.134
I see Dr. Becker

35:36.177 --> 35:37.961
because I suffer
from a condition

35:38.005 --> 35:40.660
called malignant narcissism.
It's something...

35:40.703 --> 35:41.878
I know what it is.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.272
Those patients were
taking my sessions.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.056
How selfish.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.885
Now, if you could just leave
so Dr. Becker and I can...

35:48.929 --> 35:50.104
You didn't kill those patients.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.540
Sure I did.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.194
Those murders were
expertly staged.

35:53.238 --> 35:55.370
No witnesses, no evidence.
Who else could have done that?

35:55.414 --> 35:58.199
You do know who I am?

35:58.243 --> 36:01.333
An idiot cop
who thinks he's some

36:01.376 --> 36:02.421
mastermind criminal.

36:02.464 --> 36:03.465
Actually, I am not a cop.

36:03.509 --> 36:06.294
I'm a consultant
for the NYPD.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.383
They hired me because
I wrote a book

36:08.427 --> 36:10.907
about abnormal behavior
and criminals which stayed

36:10.951 --> 36:12.779
at the top of The New York Times
Best Sellers List

36:12.822 --> 36:13.780
for over a year.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.085
Dr. Becker said

36:15.129 --> 36:16.696
that in all her
years of practice

36:16.739 --> 36:18.045
she had never met anyone

36:18.088 --> 36:20.787
as remotely
fascinating as me.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.136
What do you do again?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.878
I'm responsible
for maintaining the safety

36:24.921 --> 36:26.271
of thousands of people.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.273
A glorified security guard.
I'm sure Dr. Becker

36:28.316 --> 36:29.317
will be able to find
you another...

36:29.361 --> 36:30.971
Stay where you are.Then let her go.

36:31.014 --> 36:33.713
Those appointments of yours
that were canceled, I took them

36:33.756 --> 36:36.324
and I am gonna take credit
for everything you have done.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.804
You trapped Justine

36:37.847 --> 36:39.240
in her own cryo chamber,

36:39.284 --> 36:40.633
killing her with what
made her famous.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.244
Same with Jonathan James,
drowning in a pool.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.463
Not bad, right?

36:44.506 --> 36:45.768
DYLAN: Well, it's a
little on the nose,

36:45.812 --> 36:46.943
but I guess not bad.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.207
What are you gonna
do with Dr. Becker?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.469
Bury her in her couch?

36:50.512 --> 36:54.124
Or have you stuffed
her full of sedatives?

36:54.168 --> 36:56.953
You are smarter than
I gave you credit for.

36:56.997 --> 37:00.043
You'll die protecting
your victim.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.263
Too bad. Would've been a really
nice ending to your next book.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.917
Say good-bye.
Good-bye.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.135
[gunshot]

37:07.181 --> 37:08.530
Dr. Becker, Dr. Becker.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.619
EMTs are on their way. She okay?

37:10.663 --> 37:12.882
She's losing consciousness,
but still breathing.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.281
JUSTINE:
Practice tape, day one.

37:20.325 --> 37:24.981
Dr. Becker suggested I practice
vulnerable moments out loud

37:25.025 --> 37:29.377
to get more comfortable
expressing my feelings.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.379
It feels weird.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.381
I hope it works.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.950
Honey, I'm so sorry
that I argued with you

37:36.993 --> 37:40.170
about going away
for our anniversary.

37:40.214 --> 37:44.044
I want to spend time with you.

37:44.087 --> 37:47.613
I know I need
to balance things more.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.832
That's what this work
is all about.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.009
But I'm thinking
about what you said.

37:53.053 --> 37:56.970
Extending our lives won't be
worth much of anything

37:57.013 --> 38:00.887
if we don't take the time
to enjoy the things

38:00.930 --> 38:04.282
and the people that we love.

38:06.371 --> 38:09.330
JOEL: I thought she
left me behind,

38:09.374 --> 38:12.333
but she was doing it for me,

38:12.377 --> 38:14.335
for us.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.163
I'm sorry.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.773
Do you mind if I
watch this some more?

38:17.817 --> 38:19.949
Oh, of course not.Thank you.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.309
Hacking into China's network?

38:31.352 --> 38:33.311
Shopping for socks.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.576
You okay?

38:44.800 --> 38:49.544
Lizzie, I went to the precinct
because I wanted to be near you,

38:49.588 --> 38:53.461
but I realize now
that was foolish.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.376
I'll leave as soon as
I restore the system.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.813
When I said I wanted
more of you,

38:57.857 --> 39:00.033
I didn't mean
in the form of pretending

39:00.076 --> 39:01.817
to be someone else.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.950
For this to work,

39:03.993 --> 39:07.867
we both have
to take some risks.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.696
I need to know you.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.045
Simple things.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.656
Stories from your childhood,

39:14.700 --> 39:17.485
why we never go
to your place.

39:17.529 --> 39:20.793
Keeping secrets is
what keeps me alive

39:20.836 --> 39:24.318
and... I don't know,
interesting.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.189
No, it's not interesting.

39:26.233 --> 39:30.411
It's... it keeps you
from being known.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.458
[sighs]

39:33.501 --> 39:35.111
Reuben.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.418
What?

39:37.462 --> 39:40.029
My real name. Reuben.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.336
My second name is Julian.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.425
But who in their right mind

39:44.469 --> 39:46.035
wants to be known
as a deli sandwich?

39:46.079 --> 39:48.603
[chuckles]

39:51.998 --> 39:54.957
And I'm not at the precinct
just to be with you.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.655
I can't tell you why now,

39:56.698 --> 40:00.049
but I will soon. I promise.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.886
Thank you.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.154
[doorbell rings]

40:18.198 --> 40:19.634
Expecting someone?

40:19.678 --> 40:22.071
No.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.812
[Lizzie sighs heavily]

40:25.771 --> 40:27.468
Hey.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.775
I ended it with David.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.080
Oh.

40:31.124 --> 40:34.214
What happened?
I'm so sorry.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.477
I'm not. As it turns out, it
wasn't the wedding planning

40:36.521 --> 40:37.783
that was the issue.

40:37.826 --> 40:39.741
He cheated on me.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.526
You think I could stay
here for a while?

40:41.569 --> 40:43.745
Of course.
Any-Anything you need.

40:45.051 --> 40:47.009
You can just put
that down here.

40:47.053 --> 40:50.535
Uh... let's have some wine.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.980
Uh, uh, I need to...

41:01.023 --> 41:02.372
I'll be right back.

41:02.416 --> 41:04.331
I'm just...

41:11.164 --> 41:12.557
[whispering]:
Julian.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.173
Reuben?

41:31.227 --> 41:33.534
"And then I suggested
to Detective Needham...

41:33.578 --> 41:37.582
"I cleverly suggested...

41:37.625 --> 41:40.933
"I brilliantly suggested
to Detective Needham

41:40.976 --> 41:42.543
who the suspect might be."

41:42.587 --> 41:45.328
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.547
Uh, I'm looking for
Lieutenant Jasmine Gooden.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.810
Oh, she's gone
for the night.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.725
Are you here
to report a crime?

41:50.769 --> 41:53.162
Uh, actually no.
Uh, I'm here to investigate one.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.382
Detective Ryan Stock,
Garfield County PD.

41:57.079 --> 41:58.951
Nice to meet you.

41:58.994 --> 42:01.214
Dylan Reinhart.

42:01.257 --> 42:02.781
Nebraska.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.478
Yeah, how'd you know?

42:04.522 --> 42:05.697
Midwestern
speech pattern.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.047
Of the six Garfield Counties
in the U.S.,

42:08.090 --> 42:09.570
only one is in Nebraska.

42:09.614 --> 42:12.355
There's also a faint smell
of almonds emanating, I think,

42:12.399 --> 42:16.490
from the chokecherry stain
on your T-shirt.
[chuckles]

42:16.534 --> 42:19.624
And it says Nebraska
on your file.

42:19.667 --> 42:22.670
Right. Yeah, I haven't had much
time to shower or change.

42:22.714 --> 42:25.107
When I heard about the woman
you guys found in the park,

42:25.151 --> 42:26.848
I jumped in my car and
I drove straight here.

42:26.892 --> 42:29.590
I think your case
may be related

42:29.634 --> 42:31.679
to a murder I'm
investigating in Garfield.

42:31.723 --> 42:33.072
Why is that?

42:34.595 --> 42:35.727
Because of this.

42:38.643 --> 42:41.210
The "Sleeping Beauties" case.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.298
I'm gonna catch
whoever did this.
