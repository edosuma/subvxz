00:02.836 --> 00:05.045
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

00:05.213 --> 00:07.673
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

00:07.841 --> 00:11.593
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.513
Still, it's just such reckless spending.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.598
When somebody steals your credit card...

00:16.766 --> 00:19.810
...they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

00:23.064 --> 00:28.068
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.155
That's me.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.117
Oh! Oh, the yuck.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.786
He's doing it again!

00:37.954 --> 00:40.247
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

00:40.415 --> 00:42.791
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

00:42.959 --> 00:44.126
Come here, Marcel!

00:44.294 --> 00:46.503
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'll get him.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.673
You've got to do something
about the humping.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.092
What? It's just a phase.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.095
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

00:57.265 --> 01:00.684
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.228
Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

01:03.396 --> 01:04.688
- What?
- Ugh!

01:05.230 --> 01:08.650
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

02:00.036 --> 02:03.705
Ugh, Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.708
- This woman's living my life.
- What?

02:07.168 --> 02:10.838
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.257
Look at this. Look.

02:13.424 --> 02:16.093
She buys tickets to plays I want to see.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.596
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

02:19.764 --> 02:22.349
She spent $300 on art supplies.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.892
You're not an artist.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.062
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

02:27.814 --> 02:32.192
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.112
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.447
Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?

02:37.615 --> 02:41.118
Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"

02:41.744 --> 02:44.121
Do I go horseback riding
in the park, hmm?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.331
Do I take classes at The New School?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.500
- No.
- No.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.377
This is so unfair.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.964
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.558
How about Joey Paponi?

03:04.726 --> 03:08.937
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks
I should have a name that's more neutral.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.939
Joey Switzerland?

03:15.820 --> 03:20.199
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm...

03:20.366 --> 03:21.617
...this big.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.993
Which I'm not!

03:25.538 --> 03:28.874
Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.294
Stalin.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.714
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.426
- Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
- Huh.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.804
Joe Stalin.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.850
You know, that's pretty good.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.561
- You might want to try Joseph.
- Ah!

03:55.985 --> 03:58.528
Joseph Stalin!

03:59.030 --> 04:01.323
- I think you'd remember that!
- Oh, yes!

04:03.076 --> 04:05.702
Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.581
Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.091
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.591
Hi.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.846
Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

04:25.014 --> 04:29.351
Um, I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.146
What are you doing?

04:33.314 --> 04:34.648
All right, great.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.817
Great. Thanks a lot.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.819
I'm going to tap class.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.239
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.825
She's got my life.
I want to see who she is.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.369
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

04:49.289 --> 04:51.248
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.251
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.253
This is madness, I tell you.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.547
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!

05:02.176 --> 05:04.136
Thank you.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.103
What do you think?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.272
Lots of things.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.108
Which one do you think she is?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.943
- May I help you?
- Oh, no, thanks.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.862
We're just here to observe.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.907
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

05:26.075 --> 05:27.409
Spare shoes are over there.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.039
What does she mean?

05:32.248 --> 05:34.082
I think she means, "You dance...

05:34.250 --> 05:35.917
...a dance class!"

05:36.127 --> 05:37.919
Come on, come on, come on!

05:38.129 --> 05:39.671
Really?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.799
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

05:42.967 --> 05:47.596
People, last time there were yogurt containers
lying around after class.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.598
Let's not have that happen again!

05:50.350 --> 05:52.142
She could be you.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.065
Let's get started.

05:58.649 --> 06:02.694
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.242
Okay, I'm not getting this!

06:09.452 --> 06:12.537
I'm totally getting it!

06:16.626 --> 06:20.420
Do you ever just feel like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

06:28.262 --> 06:30.430
What? You just click when they click.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.810
All right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.478
Oh! Oh.

06:36.646 --> 06:41.608
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.736
Great, it's gym class all over again.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.405
Aww.

06:46.989 --> 06:50.784
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.996
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

07:00.253 --> 07:04.965
It's okay, it's okay!
I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.383
Okay, here I am.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.052
So who's the new tense girl?

07:09.554 --> 07:10.762
She's your partner.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.681
- Hi, I'm Monica.
- Hi.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.392
Oh, ha.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.686
Monica.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.855
Hi, I'm Mon...

07:20.022 --> 07:21.064
Nana.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.567
- Monana?
- Yeah.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.610
It's Dutch.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.363
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.162
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.622
And we're dancing!

07:37.790 --> 07:40.542
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.925
Hi.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.765
- Where have you been?
- I just got back from the vet.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.603
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

08:02.648 --> 08:05.650
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.070
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.157
Hey, he beat you!

08:15.912 --> 08:20.916
She says, as time goes on,
he'll start getting aggressive and violent.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.584
What does this mean?

08:24.962 --> 08:26.421
I have to give him up.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.650
I can't believe it. This sucks!

08:46.817 --> 08:50.320
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

08:50.488 --> 08:53.782
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing...

08:53.950 --> 08:56.451
...and before you know it,
he's this little thing...

08:56.619 --> 08:59.246
...I can't get off my leg.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.457
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

09:02.625 --> 09:03.667
No. No.

09:03.834 --> 09:07.671
The vet said that unless he's in a place
where he has regular access...

09:07.838 --> 09:12.092
...to some monkey loving...

09:13.177 --> 09:15.136
...he's just gonna get vicious.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.181
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.852
- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
- I know that one!

09:27.358 --> 09:30.277
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

09:31.862 --> 09:36.241
We're applying to a lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.035
You know, like, uh, San Diego.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.371
Right?

09:41.539 --> 09:45.875
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

09:48.170 --> 09:52.507
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.177
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.017
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.977
- Hi.
- We found the girl!

10:04.145 --> 10:05.770
- What?
- Did you call the cops?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.522
Nope. We took her to lunch.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.400
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.738
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

10:14.905 --> 10:17.490
She stole! She's a stealer!

10:18.242 --> 10:21.369
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.874
I mean, she's this astounding person...

10:26.042 --> 10:28.251
...with this amazing spirit!

10:28.419 --> 10:31.546
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

10:33.883 --> 10:36.217
- Take off their hats.
- Popes in a Volkswagen!

10:36.385 --> 10:37.677
Mm-hm.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.681
I love that joke.

10:44.810 --> 10:50.190
- No way! No way did you do this!
- Monana was very brave.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.941
It was so wild.

10:52.109 --> 10:55.070
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 615...

10:55.237 --> 10:59.115
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

10:59.283 --> 11:02.786
So when they caught on to the fact
that we're short and have breasts...

11:03.287 --> 11:06.998
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

11:07.166 --> 11:09.167
Go, Monana!

11:11.295 --> 11:14.964
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones living the dream.

11:15.132 --> 11:20.011
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.348
Oh, by the way...

11:23.516 --> 11:26.810
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.312
Excuse me?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.189
There's an open call for Cats.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.192
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing "Memories"...

11:34.360 --> 11:37.445
...and make complete fools of ourselves.
What do you say?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.490
No, no, no.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.326
Remember who
you're dealing with here. Ha.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.663
I'm not like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.832
That's because of
your Amish background.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.920
- What?
- Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.171
Right.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.842
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.095
I was just like you.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.224
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my life.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.310
- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
- Uh-huh.

12:09.478 --> 12:13.148
I thought that movie was so incredibly...

12:13.315 --> 12:14.357
...boring!

12:14.900 --> 12:17.068
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid...

12:17.236 --> 12:19.821
...kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

12:20.656 --> 12:21.990
What was that?

12:22.158 --> 12:26.786
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater!"

12:28.956 --> 12:30.790
I walked out of there, and I thought:

12:30.958 --> 12:35.378
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

12:35.588 --> 12:39.257
And that scared me more than
all the other crap I was afraid to do.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.092
Wow.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.470
Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.521
Oh, God.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.192
We didn't get into Scranton.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.946
That was our safety zoo.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.825
They take, like, dogs and cows.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.245
See?

13:09.413 --> 13:12.874
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.628
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.590
Marcel. Marcel.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.050
Marcel, no.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.261
Good boy!

13:25.429 --> 13:27.514
See? How can nobody want him?

13:27.681 --> 13:29.599
Somebody will.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.271
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.653
You're kidding!

13:42.905 --> 13:47.158
Apparently, he was this Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

13:48.994 --> 13:52.455
- You'd think you would've known that!
- You'd think I would've.

13:55.042 --> 13:59.212
Phoebe, what do you think
a good stage name for me would be?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.507
Flame Boy!

14:10.182 --> 14:11.891
Where exactly is your zoo?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.811
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.730
It's, uh, more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.317
Let me ask you some questions about...
Is it, uh, Marcel?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.069
- Yes.
- Yes. Uh...

14:23.237 --> 14:25.238
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.324
No, no. He's very docile.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.744
Hmm. Even if he were cornered?

14:34.790 --> 14:37.250
Well, I don't know. Why?

14:37.418 --> 14:40.461
Um, how is he at handling small objects?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.340
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.469
What about a hammer or a small blade?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.934
Why would he need a blade?

14:55.102 --> 14:58.187
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns...

14:58.355 --> 15:00.440
...you got to give
the little guy something.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.901
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

15:05.654 --> 15:08.072
He got into San Diego!

15:08.240 --> 15:09.407
- What?
- Yeah.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.827
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing...

15:12.995 --> 15:14.621
- He's in!
- He's in? Ah!

15:14.788 --> 15:16.623
Did you hear that, Marcel?

15:16.790 --> 15:19.584
San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!

15:19.752 --> 15:22.879
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good...

15:23.047 --> 15:26.382
...but if you give him to me,
I'll start him against a blind rabbit...

15:26.550 --> 15:28.551
...and give you 20 percent of the gate.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.571
Yo-ho!

15:49.865 --> 15:51.115
Where have you been?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.243
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.621
Are you drunk?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.248
No!

16:03.003 --> 16:04.379
I'm lying.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.756
I am so drunk!

16:06.924 --> 16:08.257
Oh, God!

16:08.425 --> 16:11.094
Ugh. Great. You know what?
You could have called.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.179
I've been up here. I've been worried...

16:13.347 --> 16:14.722
Monica.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.766
Monica?

16:19.895 --> 16:22.522
Water rules!

16:25.109 --> 16:27.110
Yes. Yes, it does.

16:27.277 --> 16:31.531
The restaurant called.
They want to know if you're showing up.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.241
Nope!

16:33.409 --> 16:35.785
I'm going to the Big Apple Circus today.

16:35.953 --> 16:39.998
What are you doing?
You're gonna lose your job. This is not you!

16:40.165 --> 16:41.916
No, it is me!

16:42.084 --> 16:45.294
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows...

16:45.546 --> 16:47.755
...and pay the bills as soon as they come in!

16:47.965 --> 16:52.677
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.512
I'm...

16:55.472 --> 16:58.307
I'm Monana!

17:03.439 --> 17:05.565
Ahem, hello?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.817
Yes, she is. Hold on a second, please.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.819
Ahem, Monana, it's for you.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.989
The credit card people.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.450
Hello?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.661
Yes?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.040
Oh, my God!

17:22.915 --> 17:24.416
Thanks.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.919
What?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.547
They've arrested Monica.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.351
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.187
How are you?

17:44.354 --> 17:47.023
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.776
How did you know I was here?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.404
Because...

17:54.323 --> 17:55.490
...I'm Monica Geller.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.702
It was my credit card you were using.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.246
That I was not expecting.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.041
I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.834
Oh.

18:07.002 --> 18:10.088
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.590
You have given me so much.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.926
If it wasn't for you,
I'd never have gotten...

18:15.094 --> 18:17.762
...to sing "Memories"
at the Winter Garden Theater.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.056
Actually, you only got to sing "Memo..."

18:22.476 --> 18:26.395
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

18:26.563 --> 18:29.107
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.526
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

18:32.152 --> 18:36.572
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women...

18:36.740 --> 18:41.077
...and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

18:42.204 --> 18:45.915
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.584
There's nothing to wonder about.

18:48.752 --> 18:52.547
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.424
- Not necessarily.
- Yes, necessarily.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.469
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.600
Um, I'm not actually Amish.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.311
Really? Then why are you like that?

19:23.453 --> 19:25.037
You by the door, in or out?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.332
In!

19:33.797 --> 19:35.840
You in the back, you're getting it wrong!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.842
At least I'm doing it!

19:52.566 --> 19:56.485
This is the final
boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego...

19:56.653 --> 19:58.988
...boarding at Gate 42A.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.532
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.994
- I wrote you this poem.
- Aw.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.872
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.917
- Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
- Aww.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.380
Okay, bye, champ.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.425
There's gonna be a lot of babes
in San Diego...

20:19.593 --> 20:23.137
...but remember, there's also a lot to learn.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.563
I don't know what to say, Ross.
Uh, it's a monkey.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.025
Just say what you feel, Joey.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.819
Marcel, I'm hungry.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.863
That was good.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.452
- Marcel, this is for you.
- Oh.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.498
It's, uh, just, you know,
something to, um...

20:51.250 --> 20:53.376
...do on the plane.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.215
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment, just me and him.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.385
- Sure.
- Of course. Absolutely.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.263
Oh.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.976
Marcel, come here. Come here.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.852
Come here.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.646
Well, buddy...

21:15.649 --> 21:17.066
...this is it.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.361
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.365
I'm really gonna miss you.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.451
You know? And I'm never gonna
forget about you.

21:27.619 --> 21:32.498
You've been more than just a pet to me.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.292
You've been more like a...

21:34.459 --> 21:36.585
Okay. Marcel, would you...?

21:37.379 --> 21:39.630
Marcel, would you leave my leg alone?

21:39.798 --> 21:43.426
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds? Marc... Would you...?

21:43.593 --> 21:47.430
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

22:09.369 --> 22:13.164
O! That I were a glove
upon that hand...

22:13.332 --> 22:17.043
...that I might touch thy cheek.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.879
That's fine. Thank you.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.839
Next.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.346
Hi. Uh, I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.474
- Name?
- Holden McGroin.
