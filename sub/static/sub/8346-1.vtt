<i>Oh, Skank!</i>

02:26.325 --> 02:28.243
Fuck me!

02:28.410 --> 02:30.704
Hey.
What did you say?

02:34.165 --> 02:36.000
You teach him that?

02:36.167 --> 02:38.210
He heard it
in the locker room, Dad.

02:38.294 --> 02:40.504
<i>- From who?
- Everyone.</i>

02:40.588 --> 02:42.756
<i>You know what it's like
in there.</i>

02:50.722 --> 02:52.682
He shoots.
He scores!

02:52.807 --> 02:55.810
<i>Wouldn't start again?</i>

02:55.935 --> 02:58.562
- Was it the gas line?
- I don't know. I'll ask Tinker.

02:58.688 --> 03:00.022
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

03:00.189 --> 03:02.107
Take the sled, will ya?
I wanna wait for the mail.

03:02.232 --> 03:04.026
- The magazine's supposed to be here, express.
- Okay. Better be good.

03:04.193 --> 03:06.570
Of course it's gonna be good.
That's the whole point.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.114
I don't exactly trust
Chuckie boy.

03:32.969 --> 03:35.054
Come on.
Pass it off.

03:35.179 --> 03:37.974
<i>All right.
Let's go again.</i>

03:41.393 --> 03:43.812
Bailey!

03:43.937 --> 03:45.814
Hi, Bailey.

03:48.066 --> 03:50.193
Fat men don't shovel,
Bailey.

03:50.318 --> 03:52.529
No, it's dry.
It's dry.

03:56.073 --> 03:58.576
- Ew! Fuck me!
- That's a lung biscuit.

03:58.743 --> 04:00.536
<i>Joey!</i>

04:00.744 --> 04:02.663
That's it. Neither of you guys
are coming to the locker room again.

04:07.584 --> 04:09.461
<i>John?</i>

04:10.920 --> 04:12.755
Have a good game today.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.066
<i>- God, it's cold!
- The taters are hot.</i>

04:33.233 --> 04:36.569
Right here, Connor.
Thanks. Hot, hot, hot!

04:39.447 --> 04:43.409
<i>- What the hell kind of bird is that?
- Bobby, throw some tape.</i>

04:43.617 --> 04:47.496
<i>- It's gonna be a hot one today.
- Hey, tape!</i>

04:47.621 --> 04:49.998
- Hey, is the magazine out yet?
- Monday.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.167
- Johnny's supposed to get a copy expressed.
- Maybe we made the cover.

04:53.293 --> 04:58.339
- We ain't on the cover.
- He said it would be a big story with pictures.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.132
<i>Yeah, Chuck exaggerates.</i>

05:02.301 --> 05:05.012
Hey, guys, you are
not gonna believe this.

05:06.596 --> 05:09.641
Sarah Heinz.

05:09.808 --> 05:13.144
I know!
She's supposed to be this shy girl.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.771
<i>I figure, what the hell.
I ain't that attractive.</i>

05:15.897 --> 05:19.650
I'll vaccinate her quick, get home for an
early sack, beat what's left of the bishop.

05:19.817 --> 05:21.652
Like this?

05:21.819 --> 05:24.696
- She's much fatter naked. Yeah!
- No.

05:24.863 --> 05:28.533
I'm telling you, she got her February
fat now in the second week in December.

05:28.617 --> 05:30.827
She's riding me
like a wet walrus,

05:31.035 --> 05:34.038
<i>making these fat sounds.</i>

05:34.205 --> 05:39.043
<i>- Thwap, thwap, thwap.
- The boy's got no shame.</i>

05:39.126 --> 05:41.045
<i>You're a sick man, Skank.</i>

05:41.170 --> 05:43.047
<i>- Hey, you got the magazine? Damn.
- The mail didn't come yet.</i>

05:43.213 --> 05:45.173
- Hey.
- What?

05:45.340 --> 05:47.926
- You kill one more wolf...
- Ain't no sheriffin' in here.

05:48.051 --> 05:49.886
I ain't sheriffin'. I'm just
a teammate concerned for his freedom.

05:50.053 --> 05:51.930
<i>Come on, boys.
Let's move it.</i>

05:52.055 --> 05:54.682
It's two tenths below zero.
The committee won't be happy.

05:54.807 --> 05:59.353
- The committee.
- You seen Weeks lately? He's been skating the river.

05:59.478 --> 06:03.273
<i>I don't care. I'm about to be on
the cover of Sports Illustrated.</i>

06:05.400 --> 06:08.945
<i>That photographer said I have
one of those expressive faces.</i>

06:09.112 --> 06:13.074
- A face that tells a story.
- Too bad it's a tragedy.

06:13.157 --> 06:15.827
- A comedy.
- A horror story.

06:15.952 --> 06:18.662
Come on, guys.
Let's start gettin' our heads into it.

06:20.664 --> 06:23.667
Like Connor says,
that Weeks kid, he's got jump.

06:25.043 --> 06:26.962
I'm tellin' you, Tree,
there's rumors.

06:27.045 --> 06:29.256
One of us is going down.

06:35.553 --> 06:38.472
Let's go! Let's move!

06:48.982 --> 06:50.817
Let's go!

07:06.039 --> 07:07.958
Good game!
Good game!

07:08.083 --> 07:10.877
Stretch 'em out.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.256
- Let's do it, Sheriff.
- Sticks!

07:15.381 --> 07:18.551
<i>- Line 'em up, Michael!
- Don't give me Tree. I wanna win this week.</i>

07:18.676 --> 07:21.303
- I win no matter what side, huh?
- Win this, Tree.

07:27.309 --> 07:29.519
- Maybe it's you and me, huh?
- Winetka.

07:29.644 --> 07:31.104
Here.

07:31.229 --> 07:33.231
- Paul.
- Brown's the winner.

07:33.439 --> 07:36.442
- Dad!
- Thanks, Mikey.

07:36.609 --> 07:39.445
<i>Tree!</i>

08:11.349 --> 08:15.144
- You see Stevie Weeks yesterday?
- Chump.

08:15.311 --> 08:17.188
You think
we gotta do it?

08:23.152 --> 08:25.529
- Birdie!
- Try and pass me!

08:25.654 --> 08:28.240
- Give it to me!
- Try it! Try it!

08:28.365 --> 08:30.784
<i>Pass! Damn!</i>

08:42.169 --> 08:44.504
Whoo!
All right!

08:47.757 --> 08:50.135
Soon, it'll be you
out there.

08:50.260 --> 08:53.388
- Oh, I don't know.
- It will, Stevie.

09:00.394 --> 09:02.896
- Ow!
- Daddy!

09:03.063 --> 09:06.858
There are things you do in public...
and things you don't.

09:06.983 --> 09:09.069
We're just kissing.

09:09.194 --> 09:11.488
For God's sakes.

09:13.698 --> 09:15.199
Geez.

09:15.324 --> 09:17.576
Very effective, Walter.

09:17.702 --> 09:19.995
Nipped in the bud.

09:20.246 --> 09:22.581
- MaryJane.
- You got it?

09:22.664 --> 09:26.668
I got it. Look. It's three pages
with pictures and profiles.

09:26.835 --> 09:29.671
<i>- There's John.
- A mix between Bobby Bond and Moose DuPark.</i>

09:29.796 --> 09:31.714
Yeah,
he won't like that.

09:31.798 --> 09:33.967
"Clears the crease like a snowplow. "
Well, he can't not like that.

09:34.092 --> 09:35.927
Come on.

09:36.135 --> 09:38.304
- Honey. Look at this.
- Hey.

09:38.429 --> 09:41.390
- The mayor should get first look. Not bad, right?
- Wow.

09:41.473 --> 09:45.310
<i>Son of a piss whore.
Our town in Sports Illustrated.</i>

09:45.435 --> 09:47.354
<i>Listen to this.</i>

09:47.437 --> 09:51.733
<i>"The legendary hockey players of
Mystery, Alaska, were born on skates...</i>

09:51.900 --> 09:55.236
<i>in a world perpetually covered
with ice and snow.</i>

<i>Isolated by rugged mountains
and vast glaciers,</i>

09:57.655 --> 10:00.950
<i>they hone their skills

10:01.116 --> 10:03.619
<i>Saturday after Saturday,

10:06.955 --> 10:10.917
<i>The citizens attend with
religious devotion in sub-zero weather.</i>

10:11.000 --> 10:15.171
<i>A committee of town fathers
decides who plays and by what rules.</i>

10:15.296 --> 10:17.840
<i>The game has become
more than a sport.</i>

10:17.965 --> 10:21.176
<i>It's a weekly
ritual celebration. "</i>

10:23.220 --> 10:26.431
<i>"The Winetka brothers
forecheck like gophers.</i>

10:26.515 --> 10:29.225
When a puck goes into a corner,
a Winetka comes out with it.

10:29.351 --> 10:32.061
- Yeah!
- Read. Read!

10:32.228 --> 10:34.022
And then there's
Connor Banks.

10:34.188 --> 10:36.941
- Connor!
- What about Connor Banks?

10:37.066 --> 10:40.361
Montreal had its rocket.
Mystery has its cruise missile!"

10:42.529 --> 10:44.740
<i>The only rocket you got
is your meat whistle.</i>

10:44.865 --> 10:47.742
Hang on. Hang on. " Perfecting the art
of the pass is John Biebe,

10:47.868 --> 10:53.414
<i>whose precision and accuracy more
than compensate for slowness of foot.</i>

10:55.500 --> 10:58.753

- Every team needs its thumper.

10:58.878 --> 11:02.047
<i>Fuck 'em, Johnny. Fuck 'em.</i>

11:02.172 --> 11:04.883
On pure skating ability,

the National Hockey League!"

11:08.386 --> 11:10.930
That's us!
That's us!

11:11.139 --> 11:11.598
And isn't it exciting
for Charlie...

11:11.639 --> 11:14.434
And isn't it exciting
for Charlie...

11:14.600 --> 11:17.478
<i>getting his article published
in Sports Illustrated?</i>

11:17.687 --> 11:19.980
I bet this is a big
accomplishment for him.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.191
He kind of embellished
a little.

11:22.316 --> 11:25.527
He's always been so smart, that Charlie.
I knew when he left he'd make it big.

11:25.652 --> 11:30.448
Well, actually, I heard he left
'cause he skated like a homosexual.

11:30.532 --> 11:34.410
You think because you scored two goals
today, you played a good game?

11:34.535 --> 11:37.246
<i>We don't talk about hockey at the table.</i>

11:37.371 --> 11:39.331
We've been talking about it
for 20 minutes.

11:39.457 --> 11:41.542
We've been talking
about the magazine.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.378
Which is about hockey.

11:44.545 --> 11:46.922
Can't we just enjoy
the attention tonight?

11:47.089 --> 11:49.633
<i>Sports Illustrated,
for God's sakes.</i>

11:49.799 --> 11:53.886
Hockey is played
at both ends of the ice.

11:54.012 --> 11:57.473
<i>You, you coast in your own zone.</i>

11:57.640 --> 12:01.685
<i>You skate like a figure skater.</i>

12:01.810 --> 12:04.897
<i>And when you get the puck,
you don't pass.</i>

12:07.274 --> 12:09.150
More potatoes?

12:14.697 --> 12:16.782
<i>No.</i>

12:16.908 --> 12:19.243
I've lost my appetite.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.955
Oh...

12:27.084 --> 12:29.753
<i>He never made the Saturday game.</i>

12:29.878 --> 12:32.255
That's what's bothering him.
Why should he tell me how to play?

12:32.380 --> 12:35.341
- He played college 2-A, Birdie.
- 2-A isn't the Saturday game.

12:35.466 --> 12:38.969
- That's enough.
- Well, he started it!

12:41.096 --> 12:44.057
Margie has relatives
in Waterville, Maine.

12:44.224 --> 12:47.310
She said as soon
as Price World moved in,

12:47.477 --> 12:50.313
all the local shops
went right out of business.

12:50.438 --> 12:53.858
Price World's not gonna come, Mom.
We're not big enough, for God's sakes.

12:53.983 --> 12:56.444
Well, they've been sniffin'.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.913
Oh, Skank.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.219
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

13:24.428 --> 13:27.347
<i>"On the left side,</i>

13:27.472 --> 13:30.183

13:30.308 --> 13:32.143
No, no, Shawnette.

13:32.268 --> 13:34.979
Um, remember, you want
to sound out the words.

13:35.104 --> 13:36.981
- Okay.
- Let's try again.

13:37.106 --> 13:40.818
"Skank Marden,
a master of the stick,

13:40.985 --> 13:43.695
scores on demand. "

13:43.862 --> 13:47.240
<i>That's right. Good. Excellent.</i>

13:47.407 --> 13:50.535
Tommy! What?

13:50.660 --> 13:53.955
Word is Biebe is out
and Weeks is going up.

13:54.038 --> 13:55.706
Really?

14:00.419 --> 14:02.296
- Don't get too far.
- Yeah, Dad.

14:04.506 --> 14:07.342
<i>- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.</i>

14:09.803 --> 14:11.805
Thanks for coming, Johnny.

14:16.934 --> 14:20.771
Well, we can't hold
Stevie Weeks back any longer.

14:20.980 --> 14:23.732
You'll be first alternate,
of course.

14:26.943 --> 14:28.904
That's...

14:32.198 --> 14:36.410
There's more to the game than speed,
Scott. Experience counts.

14:36.536 --> 14:39.705
Which Stevie Weeks can't get
till we call him up.

14:39.830 --> 14:43.167
You've been in the Saturday game
13 years, Johnny.

14:43.292 --> 14:48.046
- That's a record!
- I can still play.

14:48.171 --> 14:51.674
When was the last time
you scored a goal?

14:54.927 --> 14:57.555
Look, it's not fair to the Weeks boy
to keep him back.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.767
<i>And it's not fair
to the Saturday game.</i>

15:15.238 --> 15:17.365
Shit!

15:44.431 --> 15:46.141
<i>I gotta go.</i>

16:02.156 --> 16:04.032
Donna's inside, Johnny.

16:07.536 --> 16:10.413
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.883
I'm fine, Donna.

16:29.306 --> 16:31.558
We talked about this.

16:31.724 --> 16:36.771
We knew one day eventually...
I'm fine.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.814
Don't tell me you're fine.

16:52.827 --> 16:54.704
I better check on Mike.

17:20.644 --> 17:23.646
<i>- You could've told me.
- I can't give you that kind of information.</i>

17:23.771 --> 17:26.608
We're sleeping together,
for God's sakes.

17:26.733 --> 17:30.320
Skank, we're committing adultery. It's
not like I threw in trust as a perk.

17:30.445 --> 17:32.614
<i>Honey.</i>

17:32.697 --> 17:36.659
- Hi.
- Look, you, uh... you may have heard.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.786
- We just did it.
- I heard.

17:38.911 --> 17:41.330
And so did I,
and it's a big mistake.

17:41.497 --> 17:44.917
John Biebe is the anchor,
for God's sakes!

17:47.085 --> 17:48.878
Geez.

17:52.757 --> 17:55.843
<i>Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!</i>

17:55.968 --> 17:59.263
Guys, it ain't my birthday.

17:59.430 --> 18:01.473
It's better.
You're in the Saturday game!

18:01.640 --> 18:04.726
L- I could go down
as fast as I come up.

18:04.893 --> 18:08.730
- There's no way.
- Hey, I'm next. They'll be callin' me next.

18:16.404 --> 18:18.280
Hey, Mike.

18:18.447 --> 18:21.742
- Hey.
- Why don't you get yourself that milkshake?

18:33.253 --> 18:35.671
Better not hear
your grades are dropping off.

18:37.673 --> 18:39.508
They-They won't, sir.

18:39.675 --> 18:44.012
You skate like you can
and you'll be fine.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.851
- Boys.
- Sheriff.

18:51.436 --> 18:53.730
<i>- I ordered one for you too, Dad.
- Thanks, Mike.</i>

18:53.813 --> 18:55.773
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

18:55.898 --> 19:00.236
You gotta get out to Gagney Grocers.
Connor Banks just shot a guy.

19:04.198 --> 19:07.117
Ow! Jesus!
What, did you put your finger in it?

19:07.242 --> 19:09.369
<i>- Try and hold still.
- Could you jam the oxygen tank...</i>

19:09.452 --> 19:11.371
<i>a little further up my ass, please?</i>

19:11.454 --> 19:14.123
<i>Have you done this before?</i>

19:14.290 --> 19:18.252
- Who is he?
- A rep from Price World.

19:18.419 --> 19:20.337
<i>Good. Twist it! Yeah, that helps.</i>

19:20.504 --> 19:23.841
<i>Think about trimming
those nails too, Tarzan.</i>

19:23.966 --> 19:26.760
<i>- Just try to hold it there.
- Are you trying to hurt me?</i>

19:26.968 --> 19:28.845
Huh?

19:28.970 --> 19:31.389
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

19:31.514 --> 19:34.559
Do I look like I'm okay?
The fucker shot me!

19:34.726 --> 19:38.437
What the fuck-ass fuck of a bum-fuck,
shithole town is this?

19:38.604 --> 19:41.106
<i>I make a business call.
I give him my card.</i>

19:41.231 --> 19:45.360
And the hick-ass fucker shoots
my foot off! Cock-fucking shit!

19:48.488 --> 19:51.825
- John, it was an accident.
- You read him his rights?

19:51.950 --> 19:54.911
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, come on, John!

19:55.078 --> 19:57.371
- I didn't mean to shoot him.
- Call Bailey Pruitt. Talk to him.

19:57.455 --> 19:59.331
Don't be saying
anything to me.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.458
<i>Johnny, I heard.</i>

20:01.583 --> 20:06.421
- I'm sorry.
- Connor, you just shot a guy.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.340
- Take him.
- Read him his rights.

20:08.506 --> 20:11.759
<i>Cock-fucking suck-ass fucker!</i>

20:11.885 --> 20:13.970
<i>Have fun in jail, asshole!</i>

20:14.137 --> 20:16.222
They, uh,
got into a beef.

20:16.347 --> 20:19.892
<i>- Connor pulled a pistol.
Happened over in feed.</i>

20:20.017 --> 20:24.021
Says he was aiming at a sack
of Puppy Chow, trying to scare him.

20:24.188 --> 20:26.148
He hit a wheelbarrow.
It ricocheted.

20:26.314 --> 20:29.317
<i>- Ow! Ow, ow!
- Johnny?</i>

20:29.442 --> 20:33.738
- Yeah?
- There's a helicopter hovering over town hall. Looks Russian.

20:58.803 --> 21:01.055
Whoa!

21:01.180 --> 21:03.849
I'm slow in the feet?

21:04.016 --> 21:06.435
That's it?
That's all you got for me?

21:06.560 --> 21:11.356
<i>No, "Wow, nice helicopter"? No, " Hey,
great article in Sports Illustrated"?</i>

21:11.523 --> 21:13.483
How's Donna doing?
Does she miss me?

21:15.151 --> 21:17.611
Twice in one year, Charlie.
What do you want this time?

21:19.822 --> 21:22.199
I come bearing
the New York Rangers.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.536
The New York Rangers?

21:26.661 --> 21:29.289
Yeah, I was pretty blown away myself.

21:29.456 --> 21:32.292
But the article sparked some kind
of brainstorm at the NHL.

21:32.458 --> 21:36.379
<i>- Good writing, I guess.
- The New York Rangers.</i>

21:36.504 --> 21:38.422
The New York Rangers.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.966
- In Mystery, Alaska?
- Right here.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.926
To play against our boys?

21:43.051 --> 21:45.012
The NHL feels it'll be
great publicity,

21:45.178 --> 21:49.266
and the network figures
a 14 share, minimum.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.851
All right.

21:52.018 --> 21:54.270
What's in it for you,
Charlie?

21:54.395 --> 21:56.397
Community pride.

21:56.564 --> 21:58.566
A sense of giving back to
the place where I grew up.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.196
Money.

22:10.368 --> 22:15.706
If you all settle down, we'll, uh,
we'll try to answer all your questions.

22:15.873 --> 22:18.000
Now, nothing is definite.

22:18.125 --> 22:21.795
There's still some dealing to be done
with the players' unions and things.

22:21.962 --> 22:25.299
But what needs to be decided first is,
do we want this game?

22:25.465 --> 22:29.594
<i>- I won't kid ya, it would be
a goose to the economy.</i>

22:29.719 --> 22:31.888
<i>What economy?</i>

22:33.139 --> 22:35.308
We can be serious
about this,

22:35.475 --> 22:39.103
or we can simply leave the decision to
the committee, which I'm quite happy to do.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.355
Yes, Miram?

22:41.480 --> 22:45.776
The question is,
do we really stand a chance?

22:45.901 --> 22:48.778
<i>'Cause if all that's gonna happen
is we'll get laughed at,</i>

22:48.945 --> 22:51.322
I'm not for it
at any price.

22:51.448 --> 22:53.741
That's fair. That's fair.
And to answer that,

22:53.825 --> 22:57.244
I'd like to call up here
someone we all know and...

22:57.453 --> 23:01.457
Well, we all know.
Charles Danner.

23:07.921 --> 23:11.549
Thanks. Um... Well, first of all,
it's really great to be back.

23:11.674 --> 23:15.052
<i>Bullshit!</i>

23:15.178 --> 23:17.763
<i>Uh... Um, here's the thing.</i>

23:17.847 --> 23:20.933
On a standard ice rink,
no, we don't come close.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.560
But... our boys on a pond?

23:23.602 --> 23:26.521
<i>Now, hold on
just one second.</i>

23:26.646 --> 23:31.192
You're using words
like "we" and "our boys. "

23:31.317 --> 23:33.361
You left this town,
Charlie Danner.

23:35.488 --> 23:37.323
You can't even skate.

23:39.158 --> 23:42.536
Plus, this may be
an old lady talking,

23:42.619 --> 23:45.539
but I've always thought
you were a bit of a prick.

23:47.666 --> 23:50.877
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is a town meeting.</i>

23:51.002 --> 23:54.922
Let's have some order,
for God's sakes! John.

23:55.089 --> 23:57.174
<i>Could we make a game of it?</i>

23:57.383 --> 23:59.218
<i>Yeah, John.</i>

24:06.600 --> 24:08.727
Depends on rules.

24:08.852 --> 24:10.770
We play four on four.
They play five on five.

24:10.895 --> 24:12.772
<i>Boards, offsides,
two-line passing.</i>

24:12.939 --> 24:15.983
Rules that keep everything bunched.
It's a different kind of game.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.903
<i>John, excuse me, but this game
is gonna be played on a pond.</i>

24:19.069 --> 24:20.946
- Hey, Chuck...
- One second.

24:21.071 --> 24:24.449
Everybody here always says on a pond,
nobody beats us, right? Nobody.

24:24.616 --> 24:27.911
Okay, well, you got a chance
to prove it now.

24:28.078 --> 24:30.789
John, can we win?

24:32.999 --> 24:37.545
Shooting, passing, stick handling...
The truth?

24:39.255 --> 24:40.923
Except for Connor,
nobody here comes close.

24:41.006 --> 24:42.758
Except for Connor,
nobody here comes close.

24:42.841 --> 24:44.718
<i>But on the pond,</i>

24:44.885 --> 24:48.597
black ice, wide open surface,
it's all about skating.

24:48.763 --> 24:50.890
And we can skate.

24:51.015 --> 24:54.852
Yeah, we can.
All right, man.

25:03.277 --> 25:05.904
The New York Rangers
are professionals.

25:08.073 --> 25:10.241
<i>Two things we've always had
in Mystery:</i>

25:12.410 --> 25:17.581
Our dignity
and our illusions.

25:17.707 --> 25:20.292
I suggest we cling to both.

25:35.181 --> 25:36.974
Where's the dignity
in not trying?

25:40.603 --> 25:42.604
I'll play those Rangers.

25:45.982 --> 25:49.277
- I'm in.
- I'll play.

25:49.402 --> 25:53.281
I'll beat 'em.

26:01.163 --> 26:03.832
<i>As mayor of Mystery, Alaska,</i>

26:03.957 --> 26:07.210
I'm gonna extend a little invitation
to the New York Rangers!

26:32.775 --> 26:34.944
Hey, Johnny!

26:35.111 --> 26:39.115
- This can't wait till tomorrow?
- No, no, we gotta be on the ice at sunup.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.909
If this game happens,
it's only 32 days away.

26:42.076 --> 26:44.286
<i>We gotta get goin'.</i>

26:44.453 --> 26:47.581
- I bet you're back on the team now, right?
- Maybe.

26:47.706 --> 26:50.083
Well, they're not gonna play the Rangers
with just ten guys.

26:50.208 --> 26:53.127
Here he comes.

26:53.252 --> 26:55.171
- John. Hey, Donna.
- Hey, Scott.

26:55.296 --> 26:57.590
- Witch-tit cold, huh?
- Yeah.

26:57.673 --> 27:00.509
Look, John,
these are the developments.

27:00.634 --> 27:03.554
Things have changed.
We want you to coach.

27:04.846 --> 27:06.681
Judge turn you down?

27:06.848 --> 27:09.934
Yeah.
He's got some bug up his colon.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.729
But next toJudge Fuck Nut,
you know most about hockey.

27:12.895 --> 27:15.398
Scott, you'll need him
to play, right?

27:15.565 --> 27:17.483
Oh, uh...

27:17.608 --> 27:21.570
Well, the committee feels you can best
help the team by, you know, coaching.

27:21.737 --> 27:24.156
You're the guy.
They all look up to you.

27:24.281 --> 27:27.200
Scott, I don't coach.

27:27.325 --> 27:30.870
John, I'm asking you
as mayor of the town.

27:30.954 --> 27:32.789
Will you coach?

27:35.917 --> 27:37.752
<i>Look, think about it.</i>

27:37.918 --> 27:39.837
Let me know, huh?

27:41.255 --> 27:44.132
You know,

27:44.258 --> 27:48.762
every ex-player turned coach says
they prefer coaching to playing.

27:48.887 --> 27:51.181
Why would they
all say that?

27:51.264 --> 27:54.058
Because they can't play.

27:59.647 --> 28:02.983
So why'd you wanna come?
You never wanna come when I plough.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.402
- Well, um, could you pull over?
- Sure.

28:13.326 --> 28:17.621
What...
What are you doing?

28:17.788 --> 28:19.665
Um...

28:19.790 --> 28:23.377
I thought, um...

28:23.544 --> 28:26.421
I think we should celebrate
you making the team.

28:26.588 --> 28:30.550
N- Now? Here?

28:30.675 --> 28:33.136
I don't know where else
to do it.

28:33.219 --> 28:35.263
I got a condom too.

28:36.597 --> 28:38.599
- So...
- Marla.

28:38.682 --> 28:42.311
With you on the team, Stevie,
a lot of girls are gonna be,

28:42.519 --> 28:45.355
you know, after you.

28:51.653 --> 28:54.739
I don't wanna lose you toJody Lange
just 'cause she gives.

28:56.657 --> 28:59.535
Marla.

28:59.702 --> 29:03.330
I'm not gonna leave you
on account of not having sex.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.251
I love you.

29:20.596 --> 29:24.057
Are you sure?

29:24.183 --> 29:27.060
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.264
Oh!

30:10.350 --> 30:13.269
Oh, I'm-I'm...
I'm sorry.

30:13.436 --> 30:17.565
That's okay. That's...
That's okay.

30:17.648 --> 30:21.193
L...
Does this mean we're done?

30:21.360 --> 30:24.279
I'm-I'm sorry.
I must have...

30:24.446 --> 30:26.365
That's okay.

30:30.744 --> 30:32.829
It's okay, Stevie.

31:01.146 --> 31:05.442
Hey, Sarah, sorry to be calling on you
so late, but have you heard?

31:05.609 --> 31:09.571
- The Rangers?
- Yeah.

31:09.738 --> 31:13.366
Yeah, good news makes
the compass point north.

31:13.491 --> 31:15.576
How about a quick rattle?

31:17.161 --> 31:18.954
After you, Skank.

31:28.713 --> 31:31.925
"Mother walrus going
thwap, thwap, thwap"?

31:32.050 --> 31:35.011
- What?
- You wanna hear a thwap?

31:54.153 --> 31:57.031
Women don't like being referred to
as fat mammals, Skank.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.702
I never would've said that
to her face.

32:01.785 --> 32:05.622
- Are you gonna arrest me?
- Do you want me to?

32:05.706 --> 32:09.250
Well, if it's all over what he said, I'd
just as soon it'd be all over that I hit him.

32:11.002 --> 32:12.879
It will be.

32:20.344 --> 32:22.221
<i>You gonna let the kids keep the school?</i>

32:22.346 --> 32:24.223
<i>We gotta have a new rink, Donna.</i>

32:24.348 --> 32:27.601
You want one of those goddamn
TV trucks to fall through the ice?

32:27.726 --> 32:32.105
Plus we need new boards, lights,
and they're sending us a Zamboni.

32:32.230 --> 32:35.900
Oh, a Zamboni.
Gettin' wet just thinking about it.

32:36.025 --> 32:37.902
Jesus!

32:44.449 --> 32:46.535
- Donna. Hey.
- Hey.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.620
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hi. Good.

32:48.787 --> 32:50.663
- How are you?
- I'm good.

32:50.789 --> 32:53.207
- You ran out before I could say hi last night.
- I know. Hi.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.418
Hi.
God, you look good.

32:55.543 --> 32:58.087
How can you look this good? What do
you have, like nine children now?

32:58.212 --> 33:00.381
All right, well,
we're not the Partridge Family.

33:00.547 --> 33:03.509
- Three kids.
- I know how many kids you have.

33:03.675 --> 33:06.803
So, you're a producer, huh?

33:06.928 --> 33:08.930
Yeah, well,
associate producer.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.224
What's a producer do?

33:11.349 --> 33:13.393
Uh, well,
I'm-I'm doing it.

33:13.518 --> 33:16.771
- Really?
- Yes, I'm liaising with the locals.

33:16.896 --> 33:19.023
I see.

33:19.148 --> 33:21.442
And the helicopter was...

33:21.567 --> 33:25.737
Well, you know, it's the kind of news
you wanna deliver in person, you know,

33:25.821 --> 33:29.407
and I can't help it if it impressed
the hell out of you.

33:31.201 --> 33:35.079
So, uh...
Well, so did it?

33:36.247 --> 33:38.249
Do I look impressed?

33:39.750 --> 33:41.919
You look good.

33:48.133 --> 33:49.968
Your Honor,

33:50.135 --> 33:54.055
at this time I'd be asking the court
to dismiss the charges...

33:54.138 --> 33:57.308
<i>on the grounds of patriotism.</i>

33:57.391 --> 33:59.602
I'm not in the mood,
Mr. Pruitt.

34:01.729 --> 34:05.399
If Price World
did come here...

34:05.565 --> 34:08.235
with the one-stop shopping
and the low, low prices,

34:08.360 --> 34:12.405
it would threaten to put every merchant
in this town out of business,

34:12.530 --> 34:14.072
<i>as it has in so many communities
across this country.</i>

34:14.239 --> 34:16.617
- Trial date?
- This Tuesday.

34:16.742 --> 34:19.203
Tuesday?

34:19.328 --> 34:22.706
- Fine by me.
- All right, next Tuesday.

34:22.915 --> 34:24.750
And impanel Monday.

34:26.960 --> 34:31.840
I don't want a trial now. Suppose I
lose? I get jail, I miss the game.

34:32.005 --> 34:34.425
Connor, trust me. They're not gonna
lock up our leading scorer.

34:37.678 --> 34:41.556
As the puck comes off the ice,
the left wing will always drop back.

34:41.724 --> 34:45.560
These four swing around here,
try and force the puck this way.

34:45.726 --> 34:49.313
So the puck carrier is
always facing three defensemen.

34:49.438 --> 34:51.524
<i>- Are we gonna play it?
- No.</i>

34:51.690 --> 34:53.484
We're gonna learn it
so we can beat it.

34:53.609 --> 34:56.279
It's five-man, not four.
It's complicated.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.781
Before we get into that,

35:00.491 --> 35:04.286
There's one rule we got we live by.

35:04.411 --> 35:06.872
What happens in this room,

35:07.038 --> 35:09.499
what's said in this room,
stays in this room.

35:11.459 --> 35:13.670
Now, last night Skank
took a shovel to the temple...

35:13.836 --> 35:15.880
<i>because somebody repeated what
was said in the locker room.</i>

35:16.005 --> 35:18.841
<i>Somebody repeated
to Silvie Walker,</i>

35:18.966 --> 35:22.011
<i>and Silvie Walker
repeated it to Sarah Heinz.</i>

35:28.058 --> 35:31.394
- I told her confidentially.
- Aw, Jesus.

35:31.519 --> 35:34.522
What you say in the room
stay in the room.

35:34.689 --> 35:36.482
I didn't think she
was gonna say anything.

35:38.651 --> 35:41.070
Skank, I'm sorry.

35:41.153 --> 35:45.240
She just smoked the hog, man.
I wasn't myself.

35:48.076 --> 35:51.371
- It's your call, Skank.
- Oh, I want it.

35:51.496 --> 35:53.373
Fuck!

35:55.124 --> 35:57.251
<i>Fuckin' wind-chill. This ain't right.</i>

35:57.335 --> 36:00.337
It's not that easy!

36:00.462 --> 36:04.383
<i>- One slip of the tongue. All right, that's it.
- Rules are rules!</i>

36:06.635 --> 36:08.428
Come on, guys!

36:08.637 --> 36:11.389
- Do it!
- Come on!

36:11.514 --> 36:13.224
Aw, shit!

36:32.283 --> 36:34.452
Oh, shit!
Mother...

36:36.704 --> 36:40.249
<i>I hate you bastards!
I hate you all!</i>

36:40.374 --> 36:44.127
All I did was suggest we meet,
and then he pulled out a gun.

36:44.253 --> 36:46.129
Did he say anything,
Mr. Walsh?

36:46.254 --> 36:48.798
Objection!
Now, that question...

36:52.302 --> 36:54.846
Fuck it.

36:56.681 --> 36:58.682
What did he say?

36:58.808 --> 37:02.102
Well, he conveyed his anger at the idea
of Price World moving into the community.

37:02.269 --> 37:06.148
<i>He threatened to shoot me if I didn't
leave the premises, and then he shot me.</i>

37:06.231 --> 37:08.984
Thank you, Mr. Walsh.
Reserve the right to recall, Your Honor.

37:11.694 --> 37:14.947
Big doings we've got going here
in Mystery these days, huh?

37:15.072 --> 37:18.325
<i>Price World wants to come here,</i>

37:18.451 --> 37:21.078
and now the New York Rangers
want to come.

37:21.245 --> 37:25.832
Mr. Pruitt, I don't want to hear
anything about Price World.

37:25.999 --> 37:29.919
I don't wanna hear another word about
a hockey game. We talked about this.

37:30.045 --> 37:32.755
Yeah, well, forgive me, Your Honor.
I'm fat.

37:38.135 --> 37:40.679
Mr. Walsh, that bullet
that struck you,

37:40.846 --> 37:43.974
did it appear to ricochet
off a wheelbarrow?

37:44.141 --> 37:46.351
It... Maybe.
So what?

37:46.476 --> 37:51.481
Is it legal to shoot in the vicinity
of people in this town?

37:51.648 --> 37:54.275
You don't care very much for
our community, do you, Mr. Walsh?

37:54.442 --> 37:57.987
<i>- I have nothing against
your community, Mr. Pruitt.</i>

37:58.154 --> 37:59.947
Did you say,

38:00.072 --> 38:04.326
"What the fuck-ass fuck
of a bum-fuck shithole town is this?"

38:04.409 --> 38:07.996
Did you say that, Mr. Walsh?

38:10.040 --> 38:13.084
The game is tentatively
scheduled forJanuary 16.

38:13.167 --> 38:16.796
<i>- Hey, this is it!
- Sounds like fun, Barry, but evidently not for everyone.</i>

38:16.963 --> 38:18.839
<i>No, I don't think so, Steve.
No one thought...</i>

38:18.964 --> 38:21.050
to check with the New York Ranger
players about this.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.385
<i>The bottom line is, you only get
a few days off during this long season.</i>

38:23.552 --> 38:26.555
<i>Now, instead of spending these days off
at home with their families,</i>

38:26.680 --> 38:29.724
they're told they gotta go to Alaska
and play a game of pond hockey.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.894
<i>- This is a joke.
- Turning now to real hockey news,</i>

38:33.019 --> 38:36.063
<i>the NHL named Wayne Gretzky
as its player of the month.</i>

38:36.230 --> 38:38.691
<i>The superstar scored 17 goals
with 22 assists...</i>

38:45.113 --> 38:48.658
Yeah, wait till we beat 'em.
Then we'll see who's a joke.

38:51.911 --> 38:54.622
You guys know what you're made of.
You know what you've got inside.

38:58.501 --> 39:00.919
Nervous?

39:04.673 --> 39:07.425
- Come on, let's work it around.
- Don't leave him alone!

39:15.892 --> 39:19.645
- Whoa. That guy can shoot, huh?
- Yeah.

39:19.812 --> 39:23.232
- Get on him! Get on him!
- Okay, guys, come on, now!

39:33.408 --> 39:35.910
- Fighting the puck a little.
- Oh, let him find his legs.

39:36.035 --> 39:37.953
Yeah, his first game.
He'll be fine.

39:46.002 --> 39:47.754
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

39:50.465 --> 39:52.884
Look out!

39:56.554 --> 39:58.472
<i>Get away! Get away!</i>

39:58.639 --> 40:02.142
<i>- Stevie? Stevie!
- Give him some air.</i>

40:02.267 --> 40:05.645
<i>- Biebe.
Good work, Tree. You killed him.</i>

40:05.729 --> 40:08.023
- Head was down.
- I know. I know.

40:09.691 --> 40:11.609
I brought the salts, Dad.

40:15.363 --> 40:17.698
- Stevie?
- Huh?

40:17.782 --> 40:20.784
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Hello.

40:22.911 --> 40:25.956
Stevie, how many fingers
have I got? Hmm?

40:26.123 --> 40:28.458
I'm a premature ejaculator.

40:32.212 --> 40:36.465
<i>Let's go, guys.
Three on three.</i>

40:37.967 --> 40:40.552
- So?
- So?

40:40.719 --> 40:44.264
- Anyone special in New York?
- Uh, no.

40:44.431 --> 40:47.309
I don't... I don't want you
to feel bad about that either,

40:47.434 --> 40:50.061
just 'cause I haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than six weeks...

40:50.228 --> 40:52.480
since we broke up
in the 12th grade.

40:52.605 --> 40:54.774
- That's... The important thing is that you're happy.
- Right.

40:54.941 --> 40:58.402
You are...
You are happy, I take it?

40:58.527 --> 41:01.280
Yeah.
I'm happy.

41:01.447 --> 41:03.532
Good. Good.

41:03.699 --> 41:06.159
How is your husband,
anyway?

41:06.243 --> 41:08.703
Appears to be, uh,
well fed.

41:08.870 --> 41:10.872
Of course he is.

41:10.997 --> 41:13.499
I mean, what else
do I have to do, really,

41:13.666 --> 41:18.295
besides slave over a hot stove,
rub my fat husband's feet,

41:18.421 --> 41:22.633
dig splinters out of my ass that I get
while sitting around pining for you?

41:22.758 --> 41:26.053
Well, you said it,
I didn't.

41:26.178 --> 41:28.221
Seriously, though.
I mean, forget about me.

41:28.346 --> 41:30.807
Don't you ever wish you lived
in a town that had a museum...

41:30.932 --> 41:36.395
or someplace where brothers and sisters
were off-limits to each other sexually?

41:46.780 --> 41:49.199
All right,
just follow the light.

41:49.324 --> 41:52.744
No, just over here. There you go.
Over here. Come on.

41:52.869 --> 41:54.996
<i>Still sleepin'?</i>

41:55.121 --> 41:57.873
- How's he doin'?
- He's a little happy.

41:57.998 --> 42:00.251
<i>No, no, no.
Easy, son.</i>

42:00.417 --> 42:04.838
<i>- I'm okay. Birdie, I'm sorry.
- All right.</i>

42:05.005 --> 42:06.798
I didn't even get
the condom on.

42:06.965 --> 42:10.510
It was 'cause of your sister's breasts.
They're perky.

42:16.224 --> 42:18.601
Well, he's out again.

42:24.940 --> 42:27.359
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

42:29.486 --> 42:32.989
- Sweetheart...
- I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

42:33.114 --> 42:36.534
Well, if you can't talk
to your own mother...

42:40.287 --> 42:42.456
Stevie doesn't wanna
sleep with me.

42:43.916 --> 42:46.460
Oh. Oh.

42:47.836 --> 42:49.713
Oh.

42:49.838 --> 42:52.423
<i>Hmm.</i>

42:52.548 --> 42:55.218
So, uh, you two
have already,

42:55.343 --> 42:59.138
uh, you know,
had relations?

42:59.263 --> 43:01.598
No, he came in the condom.

43:01.724 --> 43:03.851
<i>Oh!</i>

43:04.017 --> 43:06.269
Where, uh,
was the condom...

43:06.436 --> 43:09.773
when he, uh,
you know...

43:09.898 --> 43:11.733
<i>Um...</i>

43:11.900 --> 43:15.278
On-On his, uh, serpent.

43:17.530 --> 43:20.741
Hi.

43:22.951 --> 43:24.911
What's wrong?

43:24.995 --> 43:28.248
Uh, Walter, get out.
This is private.

43:28.415 --> 43:30.625
I'm entitled to know
what's going on under this roof.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.543
After all, I am
the father of this child.

43:32.710 --> 43:35.755
Walter, if you don't leave,
I swear I'll tell you.

43:37.590 --> 43:39.383
Right.

43:52.353 --> 43:55.565
<i>The defendant will please rise.</i>

43:55.690 --> 43:58.484
What say you, Karen?

43:58.609 --> 44:01.570
The State of Alaska
versus Connor Banks.

44:01.695 --> 44:03.614
<i>Second-degree assault.</i>

44:03.739 --> 44:08.201
<i>We find the defendant
not guilty.</i>

44:12.872 --> 44:15.958
That's a not guilty verdict on Connor.
Betty?

44:16.042 --> 44:20.963
And we further order Price World
to pay damages...

44:21.130 --> 44:23.048
in the amount of $42,000.

44:23.215 --> 44:27.177
- What?
- 42,000 bucks?

44:27.302 --> 44:30.221
They can't do that.

44:33.016 --> 44:35.726
This is a criminal trial.

44:35.893 --> 44:39.355
We don't award damages
to criminal defendants.

44:39.522 --> 44:41.690
The damage award is vacated.

44:41.774 --> 44:44.901
What's that, "vacated"?

44:52.492 --> 44:55.119
Look around.
Look at yourselves.

44:56.829 --> 45:00.416
<i>You have exalted this game
above what is right,</i>

45:00.541 --> 45:02.709
but you have
your star center back.

45:04.544 --> 45:06.880
<i>The defendant is free to go.</i>

45:08.673 --> 45:11.217
You have embarrassed
my courtroom.

45:23.270 --> 45:25.605
Thanks a lot.

45:25.772 --> 45:27.607
Fuckin' moron.

45:44.581 --> 45:46.833
It's me that embarrasses you,
isn't it?

45:49.961 --> 45:54.257
- Did I say that, Brian?
- I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

45:54.424 --> 45:57.802
I'm sorry I don't feel like goin'
to college and getting some degree.

45:57.885 --> 46:01.013
<i>I'm sorry for only wanting to play hockey,
and I'm sorry that you never played...</i>

46:01.180 --> 46:05.058
in the Saturday game, but I would think
there are bigger tragedies in life!

46:05.225 --> 46:08.228
<i>Brian!</i>

46:18.904 --> 46:21.323
Scotty. Hey.

46:21.448 --> 46:23.784
I want you to meet
the folks from the network.

46:23.909 --> 46:26.995
- That's Jonathan Slaven. Scott Pitcher.
- Hi.

46:27.120 --> 46:30.457
- And, uh, this is Janice Pettibone.
- My nostrils just froze.

46:30.582 --> 46:33.334
It's a pleasure to welcome
a famous TV personality.

46:33.459 --> 46:36.128
- Uh, hi.
- Janice, see how everybody skates here?

46:36.254 --> 46:38.631
- Yeah.
- Even on the sidewalks. We should get some shots...

46:38.756 --> 46:41.842
- I can't feel my nose.
- All right, then.

46:45.262 --> 46:47.889
- She's cold.
- She's weird.

46:49.974 --> 46:52.060
"Eskimos On Ice. "

46:52.185 --> 46:55.188
In fact, that's what we're calling
the team: The Mystery Eskimos.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.108
Well, we're not Eskimos.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.735
Well, I don't think it refers
so much to your ethnicity.

47:01.944 --> 47:06.573
And the Native Americans who do live
here call themselves Inuit, shark meat.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.117
<i>The deal here is we're selling
this as a human interest story.</i>

47:09.284 --> 47:12.829
The strange snowmen who play
on a lake... the Mystery boys.

47:12.954 --> 47:15.373
<i>We don't know who they are
or what they are.</i>

47:15.498 --> 47:19.668
All we know is they have poor dental
health and can skate like the wind.

47:21.211 --> 47:23.589
It's a hockey game.

47:23.755 --> 47:26.341
- How does she know what kind of dental health we have?
- Guys!

47:26.508 --> 47:29.094
Guys!
It's just a name, you know?

47:29.260 --> 47:31.888
Nobody thinks the Dallas Cowboys
are actually cowboys.

47:32.013 --> 47:33.848
- If this ends up making fun of us...
- Scott, it won't.

47:34.015 --> 47:37.143
<i>- You think I'd let that happen?
- For business, who knows?</i>

47:37.268 --> 47:39.103
- Excuse me?
- He's right.

47:39.228 --> 47:41.105
- You'd bite off your own jimmy if the price were right.
- Really, Scott?

47:41.271 --> 47:43.982
My own jimmy? You know what?
Why don't you go plan a rummage sale...

47:44.024 --> 47:46.485
- or renew a fishing licence?
- If you try pulling something, I'll be so far up your ass...

47:46.610 --> 47:50.155
- Gentlemen.
- You sorry piece of tit meat!

47:56.160 --> 47:58.537
- Just talkin' about the game.
- Yeah.

47:58.662 --> 48:01.332
If nothing else,
it's good for morale.

48:04.835 --> 48:07.254
Good night.

48:07.337 --> 48:10.590
No blood.
Judge!

48:10.757 --> 48:13.217
- He started it.
- Don't!

48:13.343 --> 48:15.678
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

48:15.761 --> 48:17.805
I don't know how to coach.

48:17.972 --> 48:21.266
You taught half the kids in this town
how to skate. You played 2-A college.

48:21.392 --> 48:23.936
You understand
North American hockey.

48:24.061 --> 48:27.230
Shit, they used to call you
the Bear.

48:27.397 --> 48:29.482
That was then.

48:31.734 --> 48:33.820
Okay, Judge.

48:33.903 --> 48:36.781
If we're gonna make a game of it,
it should be you.

48:36.906 --> 48:39.700
It won't be, John.

48:43.704 --> 48:45.706
Come on! Pull it off!

48:45.872 --> 48:49.334
People of Mystery,
I give you...

48:49.459 --> 48:52.879
your very own Zamboni.

48:53.004 --> 48:56.841
<i>- Now, don't be alarmed.
- It looks 100 years old.</i>

48:57.008 --> 48:59.135
<i>Well, it works just like new,</i>

48:59.260 --> 49:02.513
and it's kind of in keeping with
the whole idea, don't you think?

49:02.596 --> 49:04.723
What whole idea?

49:04.848 --> 49:08.518
Scott, you got a Zamboni here
in Mystery, Alaska.

49:08.685 --> 49:11.938
Yeah.
The original.

49:37.628 --> 49:39.421
Why'd you say yes to boards?
Sponsors?

49:41.840 --> 49:44.676
You guys have never played with boards.
Won't that be a huge advantage to the Rangers?

49:49.139 --> 49:52.016
John?

49:52.100 --> 49:54.936
You've been smiling
a lot lately.

49:55.019 --> 49:57.688
<i>- Excuse me?
- Ever since he came back.</i>

49:57.855 --> 50:02.526
Charlie.
You've been smiling a little more.

50:03.902 --> 50:06.571
John, that was high school.

50:12.952 --> 50:14.745
This is not a pond.

50:19.416 --> 50:21.710
<i>The fans are into it.</i>

50:21.835 --> 50:23.712
Let's play hockey.

50:23.837 --> 50:26.256
- Oh, there we go.
- Oh, Domi and Langdon.

50:26.381 --> 50:31.344
Well, eight seconds in. Domi leads
the league in penalty minutes.

50:31.511 --> 50:34.972
<i>A couple of short rights knocks the helmet
off. Another one. Are they gonna get tired?</i>

50:35.097 --> 50:37.808
<i>- I don't know.
- We're playing these guys?</i>

50:37.892 --> 50:40.227
Oh, he's landing a couple of big ones,
and so is Domi.

50:40.394 --> 50:42.479
He's got the fans
into this one early, Sam.

50:42.563 --> 50:44.731
Yo, maybe we should fast-forward
to the hockey part.

50:44.856 --> 50:47.275
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

50:47.317 --> 50:49.694
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

50:52.405 --> 50:55.241
- Come on.

50:55.366 --> 50:58.411
<i>- Come on!</i>

50:58.536 --> 51:02.081
- Caboose, holding on back there?
- Yeah.

51:02.289 --> 51:04.374
<i>- Toot, toot!
- Uh-oh! Uh-oh, we're gonna crash!</i>

51:04.458 --> 51:06.501
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

51:06.626 --> 51:08.878
<i>- What happened down here?</i>

51:09.045 --> 51:11.589
Are you okay? Let me see.
Are you all right?

51:15.009 --> 51:17.094
It's a Rockewellian Christmas
up here...

51:17.219 --> 51:19.597
<i>skating, barbecues, snow.</i>

51:19.763 --> 51:22.516
<i>We're here with defenseman
Matt Marden and...</i>

51:22.683 --> 51:24.726
<i>- Cut.
- What?</i>

51:24.893 --> 51:27.646
<i>I can't feel my fingers.</i>

51:27.729 --> 51:31.149
You need to rub 'em on
a nice warm Yuletide log.

51:34.277 --> 51:36.612
I beg your pardon?

51:36.737 --> 51:41.241
Look. Christmas is a lonely day
for a guy to be choking his own chicken.

51:41.367 --> 51:45.579
And, as women reporters go,
I find you supple.

51:47.789 --> 51:50.708
Oh, that was lovely. It's a shame
we weren't rolling for that.

51:50.875 --> 51:53.252
I'm sure he'd be happy
to repeat it.

51:54.754 --> 51:56.839
- You need to relax.
- Charles!

51:56.922 --> 51:58.799
Do you like massages?

52:10.060 --> 52:13.271
- Tree, take the man up front!
- Defense!

52:13.438 --> 52:15.523
Tree, you've got to take
the man!

52:15.648 --> 52:18.234
<i>- Jesus!
- All right, all right, all right, all right.</i>

52:18.442 --> 52:20.361
Sorry, Johnny.

52:20.527 --> 52:24.781
- Don't say you're sorry.
- Okay.

52:24.948 --> 52:26.950
Sorry.

52:27.075 --> 52:28.910
Tree, am I a big guy?

52:30.078 --> 52:32.580
Yeah, Johnny.

52:34.916 --> 52:37.752
No. Look.

52:37.918 --> 52:40.212
See? You're the big guy.

52:40.337 --> 52:44.258
And we need you to start
playing like a big guy.

52:44.424 --> 52:47.302
Okay?
Are you a big guy?

52:47.469 --> 52:50.013
- Yes, Johnny.
- Come on. Say it.

52:50.138 --> 52:51.973
Say it!

52:54.725 --> 52:56.644
- I'm a big guy!
- Okay!

52:56.769 --> 52:59.021
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

52:59.188 --> 53:00.981
Okay, hit me.

53:01.148 --> 53:03.817
I don't want
to hit you, Johnny.

53:03.942 --> 53:06.987
- Come on, Tree. Hit me!
- Johnny...

53:07.112 --> 53:10.031
I'm notJohnny!
I'm a New York Ranger!

53:10.156 --> 53:12.825
- Hit me!
- Stop it!

53:12.992 --> 53:14.994
You look like the back end
of a moose, Sasquatch.

53:18.873 --> 53:21.750
<i>You all right?</i>

53:21.875 --> 53:23.752
Just like that, Tree.

53:23.919 --> 53:27.130
<i>- You hit me like that,
I'll kick your ass.</i>

53:27.255 --> 53:29.049
<i>Eskimo soup.</i>

53:29.257 --> 53:32.594
I'm beginning to have
second thoughts about this.

53:32.802 --> 53:36.222
And having Chuck Fuck as our liaison
with the network doesn't help.

53:36.305 --> 53:38.182
If they're gonna be pouring
a lot of money into it,

53:38.349 --> 53:41.435
I suppose you have to let them sell it.
I suppose.

53:41.560 --> 53:43.645
Besides, if they're going to
be doing a profile on the town,

53:43.729 --> 53:45.564
it's as good
as a commercial.

53:45.689 --> 53:47.732
<i>Our tourism might grow.</i>

53:47.899 --> 53:50.193
You know, this is the kind
of opportunity that...

53:50.318 --> 53:52.153
What?

53:56.324 --> 53:58.617
What's that?

53:58.784 --> 54:01.829
Skank Marden's
been in this bed.

54:29.938 --> 54:31.814
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

54:31.940 --> 54:33.733
Well, that's just great.

54:33.941 --> 54:35.818
Shit!

54:40.739 --> 54:43.408
- What?
- Uh, we got a problem.

54:43.534 --> 54:46.953
- What problem?
- Uh...

54:47.078 --> 54:49.664
They're not coming.

54:51.249 --> 54:53.126
What do you mean,
not coming?

54:53.251 --> 54:55.127
Evidently,
the Ranger players...

54:55.294 --> 54:58.547
filed some kind of grievance
with the players' union,

54:58.714 --> 55:02.759
<i>- and, uh...
- We tapped ourselves on the construction.</i>

55:02.885 --> 55:07.180
- Are you saying that we're not
going to get that money now?

55:07.305 --> 55:11.142
Uh, I don't think so, no.

55:14.771 --> 55:18.107
I'm really sorry, Scott.
I don't... I don't even...

55:20.276 --> 55:23.570
<i>Jesus Christ, Scott!
Ow!</i>

55:23.695 --> 55:26.281
Jesus! Oh, man!

55:35.706 --> 55:37.541
Hey, hey.
That's enough.

55:37.708 --> 55:39.793
It's keeping the kids awake.
Come on.

55:41.295 --> 55:43.589
I should arrest him.
That's what I should do.

55:43.714 --> 55:46.758
Arrest him for what?

55:46.925 --> 55:48.760
Fraud.

55:56.559 --> 55:59.353
Hey, he promised something
that he couldn't deliver.

55:59.478 --> 56:01.355
This town spent money,

56:01.522 --> 56:03.315
relying on
Charlie Danner's word.

56:03.482 --> 56:05.400
Flying in here
on a helicopter,

56:05.484 --> 56:07.319
- swinging the New York Rangers from his belt.
- Come on, John.

56:07.444 --> 56:09.362
- You can't blame Charlie for that.
- Who else is there to blame?

56:09.487 --> 56:11.614
You want to sympathize
with the guy, fine.

56:11.823 --> 56:14.033
<i>But I really do not
need you taking his side.</i>

56:14.117 --> 56:18.079
- Okay. What is going on?
- You tell me.

56:18.162 --> 56:20.080
Okay, I think I've been pretty patient
with this little jealousy thing.

56:20.164 --> 56:23.333
The truth is, I've been a little bit
flattered. Now I'm getting insulted.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.794
<i>- You're insulted?
- Yes, John.</i>

56:25.877 --> 56:28.755
When you read my smiling at him
as a threat, that insults me.

56:34.343 --> 56:37.346
It is not just
a random smile, Donna.

56:38.889 --> 56:40.933
Ever since he came back...

56:41.058 --> 56:43.185
you've been walking around with
a big "what if" on your face.

56:43.310 --> 56:45.687
We've been married 12 years.
Three kids.

56:45.812 --> 56:48.106
Sweetheart,
I know your smiles.

56:49.566 --> 56:51.401
And that smile is not for me.

56:51.568 --> 56:56.405
John, everyone in this goddamn town
peeks over the snowbank and wonders.

56:56.572 --> 56:58.741
Except you wonder what
it would be like with him...

56:58.908 --> 57:00.743
Charlie fuckin' Danner!

57:05.706 --> 57:08.375
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

57:08.541 --> 57:12.086
You became half dead the minute you were
bumped from that team. You disappeared.

57:12.253 --> 57:16.882
<i>This is not an easy place
for a woman, John.</i>

57:17.049 --> 57:19.969
I thank God every day
I gave birth to boys.

57:23.263 --> 57:27.726
I never chose to stay.
I chose you.

57:27.893 --> 57:30.186
<i>Give me that,
at least.</i>

57:45.659 --> 57:49.329
Move that puck, fellas!
He's opening up!

57:49.371 --> 57:52.040
Move that puck, fellas!
He's opening up!

57:52.040 --> 57:53.833
Pass it out
to the wing!

57:53.958 --> 57:57.336
<i>Pass the puck! Pass that puck!
That a boy!</i>

57:57.503 --> 58:01.006
Over here!
Whoo!

58:01.173 --> 58:04.718
<i>Hi.</i>

58:04.885 --> 58:08.346
<i>Young man,
lift your elbows.</i>

58:08.471 --> 58:11.391
<i>And that'll keep the blade
flat on the ice.</i>

58:11.516 --> 58:13.351
I mean, you paid
for the whole stick.

58:13.518 --> 58:15.436
You might as well use it all, huh?
Try it.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.396
<i>- Good! Good, McGowan!
- Good.</i>

58:21.066 --> 58:23.819
Hey. I'm goin' on a piss later.
You wanna join me?

58:25.946 --> 58:27.739
No.

58:27.948 --> 58:30.325
The league is taking
the players' union...

58:30.450 --> 58:33.494
to federal court
in New York on Tuesday.

58:33.703 --> 58:36.414
It might help if Mystery
had a face there.

58:36.497 --> 58:40.209
There's an estoppel argument
you could make.

58:40.334 --> 58:43.003
Implied third-party contract too.

58:43.170 --> 58:45.213
Hmm.

59:19.745 --> 59:23.582
Well, now we really have something
to talk about, don't we?

59:25.042 --> 59:27.878
You slept with another man.

59:28.003 --> 59:30.630
What's to talk about,
MaryJane?

59:42.891 --> 59:45.727
All I've got...

59:45.852 --> 59:50.523
is the notion that being
adored by your husband...

59:50.648 --> 59:53.067
is enough in life.

59:56.279 --> 59:58.155
<i>You never touch me.</i>

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.632
Go ahead.

01:00:26.598 --> 01:00:29.809
<i>Nothing in the basic agreement
allows them...</i>

01:00:29.976 --> 01:00:31.769
to schedule
exhibition games.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.814
- Of course we can schedule exhibition
games. - Pre-season exhibition, but...

01:00:34.981 --> 01:00:39.568
Your Honor, nothing has ever limited
this to pre-season. You know this, Harold.

01:00:39.693 --> 01:00:42.780
<i>It's a cheap stunt,
Your Honor, and everybody knows that.</i>

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:47.576
<i>They want the Ranger players to go up to
the North Pole and play pond hockey...</i>

01:00:47.742 --> 01:00:49.619
with a bunch of Eskimos.

01:00:49.744 --> 01:00:53.122
It's a big gimmick.
I mean, Mr. Pruitt himself...

01:00:53.247 --> 01:00:56.542
has brought one of his
lumberjack players with him...

01:00:56.709 --> 01:00:58.627
<i>to help him further
the exploitation.</i>

01:00:58.711 --> 01:01:00.546
Objection, Your Honor.

01:01:00.671 --> 01:01:03.715
That's-That's not
a very nice thing to say.

01:01:06.134 --> 01:01:09.137
Your Honor, we've already
spent a lot of money on this game.

01:01:09.304 --> 01:01:11.931
You can sue the league
for restitution.

01:01:12.056 --> 01:01:14.517
That's assuming that money
damages could make us whole.

01:01:14.642 --> 01:01:17.186
But our reputation
has been hurt.

01:01:17.353 --> 01:01:20.689
Reputation? Price World tried
to move up there, you opened fire.

01:01:20.856 --> 01:01:22.608
What reputation?

01:01:22.733 --> 01:01:27.028
- Could I be heard?
- Go ahead.

01:01:34.243 --> 01:01:36.912
We do have our pride.

01:01:37.038 --> 01:01:38.914
And...

01:01:44.628 --> 01:01:49.924
And, uh, maybe sometimes it's a little
too connected to how well we play hockey,

01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:52.510
but we do have our pride.

01:01:52.677 --> 01:01:56.514
And all of you,
and all the TV commentators...

01:01:56.681 --> 01:01:59.141
have been going around
saying that this is a farce...

01:01:59.308 --> 01:02:01.518
that this
is all a big joke.

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:04.563
Our town is a big joke.

01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:06.648
- Is there a legal argument coming?
- It's estoppel.

01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:08.942
It's-It's in my brief.

01:02:09.067 --> 01:02:11.694
What-What did you call...
You called my friend something before.

01:02:11.819 --> 01:02:15.198
- What did you call him?
- A lumberjack.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:19.910
<i>That boy has a heart bigger
than this whole courtroom.</i>

01:02:20.035 --> 01:02:22.121
He plays to play.

01:02:22.246 --> 01:02:24.915
He skates to skate!

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.334
He don't make
a million bucks a year!

01:02:27.459 --> 01:02:30.336
He loves the game of hockey!

01:02:30.462 --> 01:02:32.422
<i>He loves it.</i>

01:02:35.716 --> 01:02:37.510
Judge,

01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:41.972
you can't take this game
away from us.

01:02:42.097 --> 01:02:45.058
You can't.
It's not about money.

01:02:45.225 --> 01:02:47.102
It's about our...

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.855
Mr. Pruitt?
Are you all right?

01:02:53.191 --> 01:02:56.319
<i>- Bailey?
- Mr. Pruitt?</i>

01:03:00.823 --> 01:03:04.534
<i>- Bailey? Bailey? Bailey?
Somebody get this man some help!</i>

01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:08.580
He's having a heart attack!
Somebody help him!

01:03:08.883 --> 01:03:11.135
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- Bailiff, call 911.</i>

01:03:11.261 --> 01:03:13.221
<i>- Bailey!
- Give him some air!</i>

01:03:13.346 --> 01:03:16.474
<i>Get somebody in here now!</i>

01:03:16.599 --> 01:03:18.434
He's not breathing!

01:03:20.644 --> 01:03:23.105
Bailey! Bailey!

01:04:12.191 --> 01:04:14.068
My, uh...

01:04:16.988 --> 01:04:20.032
My boy Mike once asked Bailey
how he got to be so fat.

01:04:25.203 --> 01:04:27.122
He said it was...

01:04:27.247 --> 01:04:29.666
because every time
he met somebody he liked,

01:04:31.417 --> 01:04:33.669
his heart would grow
a little.

01:04:35.296 --> 01:04:37.089
There were just so many
good people in Mystery...

01:04:37.256 --> 01:04:40.092
that eventually his body
had to expand to accommodate.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:49.976
He could have left if he wanted,
but he stayed.

01:04:50.101 --> 01:04:52.937
<i>Not because other worlds
weren't available to him.</i>

01:04:54.564 --> 01:04:56.315
<i>Because he loved
this place.</i>

01:04:59.777 --> 01:05:02.070
"This is a hockey town,"
he'd say.

01:05:05.782 --> 01:05:09.619
And he never said it like it was
something we should have to apologize for.

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:20.045
We're a hockey town.

01:05:45.986 --> 01:05:48.029
I love this town, too, John.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.264
You sent him,
didn't you?

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.225
To New York.

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.942
He won.

01:06:38.159 --> 01:06:40.035
Game's back on?

01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:43.288
You're in this now,
old bear.

01:06:43.372 --> 01:06:45.957
You have to coach.

01:06:51.045 --> 01:06:53.089
If I'm coaching,

01:06:53.172 --> 01:06:56.842
I need a captain
on the ice.

01:07:07.686 --> 01:07:11.231
Move it!

01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:15.735
<i>Move it, Stevie!</i>

01:07:15.902 --> 01:07:19.697
<i>Come on, Birdie!</i>

01:07:21.448 --> 01:07:23.825
<i>Move it!</i>

01:07:29.372 --> 01:07:32.208
<i>- Move it, Birdie!
- I'm moving!</i>

01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:34.252
<i>Let's go, guys! Let's do this!</i>

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:36.504
Pick up your feet!

01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.672
<i>Push over!</i>

01:07:46.388 --> 01:07:48.848
Oh, man, I'm dying.

01:07:48.973 --> 01:07:50.850
You lose a puck
over there in the bank,

01:07:51.017 --> 01:07:53.144
you give it
to the other team.

01:07:53.227 --> 01:07:55.438
If you lose a puck...

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:58.357
along the boards,
you gotta fight for it!

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.317
Do you understand me?

01:08:00.442 --> 01:08:02.361
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!</i>

01:08:07.657 --> 01:08:10.660
<i>Come on, you guys!
Pick 'em up!</i>

01:08:10.785 --> 01:08:13.287
Whoo!

01:08:24.214 --> 01:08:26.424
<i>So, who are you gonna get?</i>

01:08:26.633 --> 01:08:28.676
Oh, some celebrity.

01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:30.886
- To sing the National Anthem?
- Uh-huh.

01:08:30.929 --> 01:08:33.639
<i>That's great.</i>

01:08:33.765 --> 01:08:35.640
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.979
<i>Coming!</i>

01:08:41.647 --> 01:08:45.734
Don't worry.
I didn't come here to sleep with you.

01:08:45.901 --> 01:08:48.528
I came to see your husband.

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:56.493
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:09:05.085 --> 01:09:07.045
Uh...

01:09:08.129 --> 01:09:10.423
I, uh,

01:09:10.548 --> 01:09:13.216
I just wanted to say,

01:09:13.384 --> 01:09:16.929
you know,
that I'm sorry.

01:09:17.054 --> 01:09:22.350
Uh, the truth is,
I don't really think about anything.

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.853
I play hockey
and I fornicate...

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:28.398
because they're the two
most fun things in cold weather.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.024
And...

01:09:31.192 --> 01:09:32.984
when I get too old
to play in the game,

01:09:33.152 --> 01:09:35.404
I'll probably just end up a drunk,
like my dad.

01:09:37.198 --> 01:09:39.116
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:45.663
And, uh,

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:48.166
I know that your
being mayor and all,

01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:53.129
this game is a real
positive reflection on you.

01:09:54.922 --> 01:09:59.260
Anyway, I'm gonna do everything
I can to win this game...

01:09:59.385 --> 01:10:01.261
for Mystery,

01:10:01.428 --> 01:10:03.847
for dead Bailey,

01:10:03.972 --> 01:10:05.974
for you.

01:10:08.184 --> 01:10:10.103
That's all
I came to say.

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:42.591
- Oh, my God!
- Is the whole team in there?

01:11:15.329 --> 01:11:19.416
- How are you? Welcome to Mystery.
- Oh, my God!

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:26.256
- Steroids?
- Yeah.

01:11:28.967 --> 01:11:32.220
- Big. -
Uh-huh. - Yeah.

01:11:32.345 --> 01:11:35.640
Not that big.

01:11:38.476 --> 01:11:40.853
- Go for it!
- Hey, what's your name?

01:11:40.978 --> 01:11:43.063
- Make it out to Stevie.
- Stevie.

01:11:44.314 --> 01:11:46.149
- Here you go, Stevie.
- Wow.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.403
Uh, a little problem,
Johnny.

01:12:04.207 --> 01:12:07.794
- Aah!

01:12:36.237 --> 01:12:40.115
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I'm leaving town.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.826
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Get down.

01:12:44.786 --> 01:12:49.499
Why? It's my Zamboni, right?
I brought it here.

01:12:49.624 --> 01:12:54.045
- You want me to take you in?
- What, are you gonna arrest me for reckless Zamboni dri...

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.797
Fine. Take me in, John.
I don't care.

01:12:56.964 --> 01:13:00.009
Why don't you impound
my helicopter?

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:04.471
Whoa. Why don't you break
my goddamn nose too, huh?

01:13:04.596 --> 01:13:07.474
They'd probably elect you mayor.

01:13:07.599 --> 01:13:12.270
- You wanna get some coffee?
- L... Where's my parade? Huh?

01:13:12.395 --> 01:13:15.273
<i>I brought 'em here.
Why don't I get a parade?</i>

01:13:15.356 --> 01:13:18.776
You know what I'd settle for
is a thank you.

01:13:18.817 --> 01:13:21.111
This fuckin' town.

01:13:22.613 --> 01:13:26.324
You know, when I left,
this town rejected me.

01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:28.285
<i>Huh?</i>

01:13:28.451 --> 01:13:30.829
The day I checked out of here,
all I could think about...

01:13:30.954 --> 01:13:33.790
was the day I would chug back in
with a Pulitzer in my hand.

01:13:33.915 --> 01:13:35.708
<i>And I would step off
that train and say,</i>

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:37.835
"Why don't you
skate on this, you... "

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.505
I'm sick.
Oh, God, I'm sick. Oh, God.

01:13:49.888 --> 01:13:51.848
So that's what this
is all about, Charlie?

01:13:51.973 --> 01:13:54.016
You saying fuck you
to all of us?

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:56.018
No, it's not.

01:13:56.143 --> 01:13:59.230
Goddamn, John,
what do I gotta do?

01:13:59.313 --> 01:14:02.399
Huh? This town is hockey,
hockey, hockey, right?

01:14:02.524 --> 01:14:04.526
So I bring back
the New York Rangers.

01:14:04.651 --> 01:14:08.029
<i>- The New York Rangers!
- You don't get it, do you?</i>

01:14:08.154 --> 01:14:10.532
Oh, I...
Clearly not.

01:14:10.657 --> 01:14:14.410
Well, leaving out the fact that you
set all this up for your own benefit,

01:14:14.577 --> 01:14:17.246
<i>we agreed to a game
of pond hockey,</i>

01:14:17.371 --> 01:14:19.206
on open ice.

01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:21.250
Now we're playing on a rink
in a box...

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:24.252
boards, blue lines,
referees.

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:26.713
What if we lose this game
25-zip, Charlie?

01:14:26.838 --> 01:14:28.840
<i>You brought back
the one thing...</i>

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.134
<i>that could tear the heart
out of this place.</i>

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:35.846
Now, either you
thought about that,

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.765
or you didn't.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:55.156
- Finally got them down.
- Uh-huh.

01:15:16.926 --> 01:15:18.677
<i>Dear Abby.</i>

01:15:20.346 --> 01:15:22.931
All the words
are crossed out.

01:15:24.349 --> 01:15:26.518
Not the important ones.

01:15:32.315 --> 01:15:34.400
Just read it.

01:15:38.779 --> 01:15:40.656
"Radiant.

01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:43.325
<i>Maximum.</i>

01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:46.244
Madly.

01:15:46.369 --> 01:15:48.621
Fancy.

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:52.667
Simple.

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:54.669
Stamina.

01:15:56.337 --> 01:15:58.172
Wedding. "
John.

01:15:58.297 --> 01:15:59.965
Keep reading.

01:16:03.719 --> 01:16:05.554
"Body.

01:16:07.347 --> 01:16:09.808
Baby son.

Bedroom. Morning.
Expressive. Tender.

01:16:15.563 --> 01:16:17.481
Take care.

01:16:18.983 --> 01:16:20.818
Love. Patience.

01:16:22.986 --> 01:16:24.821
Amends.

Human. "

01:16:30.952 --> 01:16:32.787
It's beautiful, honey.

01:16:34.539 --> 01:16:37.249
<i>John?</i>

01:17:58.365 --> 01:18:00.492
Hey!

01:18:00.659 --> 01:18:03.787
<i>Yeah.
Heard you lost a little.</i>

01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:11.419
Ah! Whoo!
You can't catch me!

01:18:14.714 --> 01:18:16.716
Okay. All right.
Okay.

01:18:29.144 --> 01:18:31.062
Hmm.

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.967
Mmm!

01:19:30.575 --> 01:19:34.328
Inuit, Eskimo... whatever.
Just zero in on faces that look local.

01:19:34.495 --> 01:19:36.330
<i>Okay, ready, five?
Take five.</i>

01:19:36.497 --> 01:19:38.249
<i>Welcome back.
I'm Jim Fox.</i>

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:40.209
And joining me right now is
hockey legend Donnie Shulzhoffer...

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.252
in from Flin Flon,
Manitoba.

01:19:42.336 --> 01:19:44.171
Donnie,
let's get right to it.

01:19:44.338 --> 01:19:46.381
I've had a chance to see the
Mystery team practice. They skate fast,

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.675
and a couple of guys
can really shoot the puck.

01:19:48.758 --> 01:19:52.595
Look, the Alaskans have never taken on a
team of this size and skill before, okay?

01:19:52.762 --> 01:19:56.932
And don't kid yourself. The New York
Rangers are taking this game personal.

01:19:57.099 --> 01:20:00.019
<i>All right?
It isn't exactly rocket surgery.</i>

01:20:00.144 --> 01:20:01.979
Now send the kids
out of the room.

01:20:02.104 --> 01:20:04.773
I don't care how fast a skater you are,
if you don't play this game...

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.025
with a big heart and a big
bag of knuckles...

01:20:07.192 --> 01:20:10.195
in front of the net,
you don't got dinky-do.

01:20:39.013 --> 01:20:41.849
- He'll see you now.
- Oh!

01:20:43.016 --> 01:20:44.810
Oh, wow.

01:20:44.976 --> 01:20:48.188
Uh, th...
Thank you for seeing me, Mister...

01:20:48.313 --> 01:20:50.190
Little Richard.

01:20:50.356 --> 01:20:52.233
This is an honor.

01:20:52.358 --> 01:20:54.861
May I?

01:21:01.366 --> 01:21:04.453
Little Richard,
I'm from Mystery.

01:21:04.536 --> 01:21:06.413
Now, this is a little town
that derives...

01:21:06.538 --> 01:21:09.165
much of its esteem
from hockey.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:11.251
<i>I was wondering.</i>

01:21:11.376 --> 01:21:15.588
When you're singing
the National Anthem...

01:21:15.713 --> 01:21:18.757
<i>- Well...
- I'm cold.</i>

01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:21.009
Yes.

01:21:21.135 --> 01:21:23.387
Which makes what I'm
about to ask...

01:21:23.553 --> 01:21:26.056
seem like
a monumental request.

01:21:26.223 --> 01:21:29.434
- Can I get one?
- Okay, everybody, get your newspapers here.

01:21:29.559 --> 01:21:33.187
- One newspaper apiece. Hi.
- Enjoy the game.

01:21:33.354 --> 01:21:35.982
Hello. I'm Doug McLeod,
and with me is NHL Hall of Famer...

01:21:36.148 --> 01:21:39.485
and two-time Stanley Cup winner,
Phil Esposito.

01:21:39.652 --> 01:21:41.612
<i>It's the Great Alaskan
Hockey Rush...</i>

01:21:41.737 --> 01:21:44.197
<i>brought to you live
by the National Hockey League...</i>

01:21:44.323 --> 01:21:46.408
<i>and the Sports Broadcasting
Corporation,</i>

01:21:46.575 --> 01:21:49.077
<i>pitting the New York Rangers...</i>

01:21:49.202 --> 01:21:54.040
<i>against a Cinderella team from
the tiny town of Mystery, Alaska.</i>

01:21:54.207 --> 01:21:56.083
And here come
the red, white and blue.

01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:12.015
- Look at this! Wow. No respect. I love it.

01:22:26.653 --> 01:22:28.697
And here come
the boys of winter.

01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:37.872
All right!

01:22:40.791 --> 01:22:44.378
<i>Well, there are
only 11 skaters to the Rangers' 18,</i>

01:22:44.544 --> 01:22:46.338
<i>but also,
it's minus ten outside.</i>

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:48.673
<i>That kind of cold
can be rough on the New Yorkers.</i>

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.176
<i>There's no doubt about it. But Mystery's
going to need more than the cold on their side.</i>

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:55.221
<i>- Yeah, Stevie!
- The town's grocer is their best scorer,</i>

01:22:55.346 --> 01:22:57.723
<i>their fastest guy
is a high school kid...</i>

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.808
<i>and the captain
is the town sheriff.</i>

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:03.103
<i>Like we said,
folks, this is a small town.</i>

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.148
And the size of this ice surface could
be an equalizer for the Mystery team.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.776
- It'll definitely help.
I've never seen ice this big.

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:12.070
<i>It's even bigger
than the Olympic rinks.</i>

01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:15.364
<i>And now,
to sing the National Anthem, the one,</i>

01:23:15.489 --> 01:23:18.450
<i>the only,
Little Richard!</i>

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:29.586
<i>"Tutti Frutti"!</i>

01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:32.171
This is great, huh?

01:23:57.903 --> 01:23:59.822
Camera three, stay off the Rangers.
They look miserable.

01:23:59.947 --> 01:24:03.659
They're freezing already. Why the hell
is he singing so goddamn slow?

01:24:16.545 --> 01:24:20.174
- Yeah!

01:24:22.426 --> 01:24:25.804
- Wow! Maybe the cold slowed him down.
- Beautiful.

01:24:25.929 --> 01:24:28.807
<i>- All right, the starting lineups...</i>

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:31.851
- Uh-oh. - Great!

01:24:31.935 --> 01:24:33.895
Starting to piss me off.

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:36.439
Where does it say
Canadian National Anthem?

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:44.571
- You all right?

01:24:46.531 --> 01:24:48.575
The Mystery team
has a shot, right?

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.827
- A shot at what?

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.831
Hey, listen, buddy.

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:58.584
Do you know where a guy can get
a rub and a tug around here?

01:25:00.294 --> 01:25:02.087
What?

01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:04.923
<i>Here we go. Let's play hockey.</i>

01:25:05.006 --> 01:25:07.175
All the hoopla is over.

01:25:07.259 --> 01:25:09.177
The puck drops here.

01:25:18.185 --> 01:25:21.688
<i>Jackson dumps Banks and gets the draw.</i>

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:24.816
<i>Back to Billy Wasson.
He moves up and gives back toJackson.</i>

01:25:24.941 --> 01:25:27.193
<i>He takes it wide
and gains the Mystery zone.</i>

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.779
<i>Down the borders with Lane
checkingJackson around the net.</i>

01:25:29.946 --> 01:25:33.199
<i>Back to Wasson, wide open.
Shoots... What a save by Holt!</i>

01:25:33.324 --> 01:25:35.993
<i>Get it out, guys!
Get it out!</i>

01:25:36.077 --> 01:25:38.704
<i>Mystery is rattled. They're
running around like a house league.</i>

01:25:38.871 --> 01:25:41.874
- Don't chase! Don't chase!
- Get it!

01:25:43.584 --> 01:25:46.378
<i>Jackson controls again.
Over to King.</i>

01:25:46.503 --> 01:25:49.047
<i>He moves it to Wasson,
over to Robertson.</i>

01:25:49.172 --> 01:25:51.841
<i>Nifty toe drag around Banks.
Shoots! And a save by Holt.</i>

01:25:51.924 --> 01:25:55.094
<i>- Shit.
- Rangers in control. Holt with another save!</i>

01:25:55.261 --> 01:25:57.138
<i>It's a shooting gallery out there!</i>

01:25:57.263 --> 01:26:00.349
<i>Wasson, a shot. Jackson shooting.</i>

01:26:00.516 --> 01:26:02.392
<i>Finally, Holt controls
the rebound.</i>

01:26:02.559 --> 01:26:04.770
<i>He dishes it around
behind the net forJohn Biebe.</i>

01:26:04.895 --> 01:26:07.188
<i>Take your time! Take your time!
- And the captain holds it there.</i>

01:26:07.355 --> 01:26:09.524
<i>Rangers press
as Mystery breaks out.</i>

01:26:09.607 --> 01:26:11.317
<i>- Biebe on over to Banks in the corner.
- Go to Connor!</i>

01:26:11.484 --> 01:26:14.028
<i>And there's the pass.</i>

01:26:14.153 --> 01:26:16.655
<i>Here comes Weeks.
He is behind the advance.</i>

01:26:16.822 --> 01:26:18.866
<i>It is one on one
with Sam Gainer.</i>

01:26:18.991 --> 01:26:21.618
<i>It is a two-man hockey game
right here!</i>

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:24.538
<i>He leads left, goes right,
shoots... Scores!</i>

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:30.210
<i>Weeks scores on the breakaway,
and Mystery leads, one to nothing.</i>

01:26:30.376 --> 01:26:32.962
<i>- That's cool!
- Unbelievable.</i>

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:35.923
One step and he was gone.

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.842
That kid can actually fly.

01:26:37.883 --> 01:26:39.802
<i>Two minutes
into the first period,</i>

01:26:39.927 --> 01:26:41.762
<i>Mystery gets
on the board first,</i>

01:26:41.887 --> 01:26:44.723
<i>- and this home crowd is going crazy.
- Whoo!</i>

01:26:52.105 --> 01:26:53.981
<i>Here we go at center ice.</i>

01:26:54.106 --> 01:26:57.443
<i>Rangers win again.
Duffin chased into the Mystery zone.</i>

01:26:57.610 --> 01:27:00.863
<i>Biebe back to get it.
Neskorami on the porch.</i>

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:03.073
<i>And hard! He stamps the captain
into the screen!</i>

01:27:03.156 --> 01:27:05.575
High sticking, fuck shit!

01:27:05.742 --> 01:27:08.495
<i>- No!
- So much for a friendly exhibition game.</i>

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:11.706
<i>- Play the man!
- Mystery has settled a bit,</i>

01:27:11.831 --> 01:27:14.500
<i>but the Rangers
continue to control.</i>

01:27:14.667 --> 01:27:16.711
<i>This is Ranger hockey.</i>

01:27:16.836 --> 01:27:19.922
<i>Wasson's back for a shot...
and Winetka steals!</i>

01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:23.300
<i>Here comes the odd-man rush.
It is Ben and Galin.</i>

01:27:23.467 --> 01:27:26.094
<i>Look at the passing here!</i>

01:27:26.219 --> 01:27:28.930
<i>Connolly trailing. Drop, pass, shot.</i>

01:27:29.055 --> 01:27:31.975
<i>- Saved by Gainer!
- Shit!</i>

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:35.394
<i>He moves it around to Yeaton.
Swings a pass on the take to Lovulette.</i>

01:27:37.021 --> 01:27:40.607
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, yes, indeed!</i>

01:27:40.733 --> 01:27:43.819
<i>- Great hit.
- Did you see that? That's my Tree!</i>

01:27:43.902 --> 01:27:47.739
<i>- And some Rangers
take exception to that hit.</i>

01:27:47.906 --> 01:27:50.033
Okay, that's it!
You're gone!

01:27:50.158 --> 01:27:52.744
<i>Outta here. Get out.</i>

01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.538
Hey, that one is too small, eh?

01:27:55.663 --> 01:27:57.540
Next time send me
a bigger one.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:28:01.877
The biggest one you got.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.380
Knock it off.
That'll be enough.

01:28:07.299 --> 01:28:09.717
<i>Come on, this is your puck!</i>

01:28:09.843 --> 01:28:12.178
<i>Banks wins the draw.
Over to Marden, up toward Burns.</i>

01:28:12.345 --> 01:28:14.847
<i>And here they come,
five on four!</i>

01:28:15.014 --> 01:28:17.892
<i>Burns lays it
behind the net to Weeks.</i>

01:28:18.058 --> 01:28:21.228
<i>Now Mystery sets off on the power play
in the Ranger zone.</i>

01:28:21.353 --> 01:28:24.439
<i>They're looking to find Connor Banks.
He is the sniper.</i>

01:28:24.606 --> 01:28:28.568
<i>Biebe. Banks.
One-timer! Scores!</i>

01:28:28.735 --> 01:28:30.695
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:34.991
<i>Connor Banks and a one-timer
from Biebe! Wow!</i>

01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:40.412
Great pass!
Great pass!

01:28:42.456 --> 01:28:44.666
<i>And it's Mystery two
and the Rangers zero.</i>

01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:47.502
<i>This kid Connor
has got a shot like a bullet.</i>

01:28:47.586 --> 01:28:50.046
I mean, he's a grocery clerk,
for crying out loud.

01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:51.965
The Rangers look stunned, Doug.

01:28:52.173 --> 01:28:54.050
<i>We're bringing
them down, guys!</i>

01:28:54.217 --> 01:28:56.093
Two-nothing.
Let's keep it up!

01:28:56.218 --> 01:28:59.221
- Whoo!
- They act like lumberjacks!

01:29:10.398 --> 01:29:13.234
Donnie, the Mystery boys... two
unanswered goals in the first period.

01:29:13.359 --> 01:29:16.821
Jimmy, you gotta love these kids.
God knows I do.

01:29:16.904 --> 01:29:19.615
<i>What is going on?
Somebody lit a fire under their ass.</i>

01:29:19.698 --> 01:29:21.700
<i>This is A-number one,
first-class hockey.</i>

01:29:21.909 --> 01:29:23.785
You know I'm not a fan
of that tippy-tappy,

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:26.204
tic-tac-toe,
wide-open skating.

01:29:26.329 --> 01:29:28.748
<i>But I'm telling you, some pretty
good goals. I'm loving these kids.</i>

01:29:28.915 --> 01:29:30.833
I want to adopt them.
How's that?

01:29:30.917 --> 01:29:32.794
I want to clean them up
and raise them as my own.

01:29:32.877 --> 01:29:34.754
Someone who's
not surprised, Brian.

01:29:34.879 --> 01:29:37.715
Donna Biebe,
wife of captain John Biebe.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.009
- Well, what a period.
- Yes, it was.

01:29:40.175 --> 01:29:43.053
What's it like seeing your husband
out there with the New York Rangers?

01:29:43.178 --> 01:29:46.556
It's great.
It's something, actually.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:49.017
Did you see
your daddy out there?

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.979
I have a toy pony.
He takes big shits.

01:29:53.104 --> 01:29:56.232
Excellent.
Back to you.

01:29:56.315 --> 01:29:58.192
Defensemen...

01:29:58.317 --> 01:30:00.944
use each other as outlets.

01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:03.113
<i>- Yes, Coach!
- Hunt in corners!</i>

01:30:03.322 --> 01:30:05.782
<i>They're not that good.
We can beat these guys.</i>

01:30:05.907 --> 01:30:08.743
<i>- They're not that good!
- You're damn right we can!</i>

01:30:08.952 --> 01:30:11.204
Yeah!

01:30:11.329 --> 01:30:12.747
Come on, let's go!

01:30:12.914 --> 01:30:14.415
<i>Ready four? Take four.</i>

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.542
<i>- Come on, Stevie!
- Steven Weeks, on the move.</i>

01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:19.128
<i>Carries out
of his own zone.</i>

01:30:19.253 --> 01:30:21.797
<i>Look out!
Yeaton rips the head off him!</i>

01:30:21.964 --> 01:30:26.176
<i>Weeks over the boards and into
the Ranger bench! Wow!</i>

01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:32.432
<i>- Come on!
- And now they help Weeks back onto the ice...</i>

01:30:32.598 --> 01:30:35.893
<i>- in that New York way.
- Give me my stick!</i>

01:30:36.018 --> 01:30:37.853
<i>Man, he's lucky
to get out of there alive.</i>

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:39.897
<i>Well, the Rangers
have stepped it up, Phil.</i>

01:30:40.022 --> 01:30:42.191
Coach Higgins must have had
one of his screaming fits...

01:30:42.316 --> 01:30:44.192
- between periods.
- Now, look at this.

01:30:44.359 --> 01:30:46.319
<i>The Rangers are platooning
back and forth...</i>

01:30:46.486 --> 01:30:48.488
<i>between the warm
dressing room.</i>

01:30:48.655 --> 01:30:50.532
<i>Well, that's something I've never seen.
- That's not legal.</i>

01:30:50.657 --> 01:30:52.825
Is that legal?
That's not legal.

01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:55.036
<i>The Rangers continue the pressure.</i>

01:30:55.161 --> 01:30:57.496
Pick up the man in front!
Pick him up!

01:30:57.621 --> 01:31:00.040
<i>Scores!</i>

01:31:00.207 --> 01:31:02.709
<i>And the Rangers
are finally on the board.</i>

01:31:02.793 --> 01:31:05.378
Let's go, guys.
Let's go!

01:31:05.545 --> 01:31:09.424
<i>Rangers on another rush.
Three on two, wide across the ice.</i>

01:31:09.549 --> 01:31:11.676
<i>Back into the slot,
shot, scores!</i>

01:31:11.801 --> 01:31:14.679
<i>The slap shot beats Holt
on the stick side,</i>

01:31:14.804 --> 01:31:17.348
<i>and that ties it up
at two.</i>

01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:19.975
<i>Put a body in front of him!</i>

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:23.478
<i>Rangers go back to work now.
Robertson to Wasson.</i>

01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.480
<i>There's a move
behind the net to Rourke.</i>

01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:27.482
<i>Apuck shot to...
Shoots and he scores!</i>

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:33.571
- Yeah!
- That's hockey!

01:31:33.696 --> 01:31:35.656
<i>It's really
starting to unravel for Mystery.</i>

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.617
<i>They just lost their composure,
and now they are paying for it.</i>

01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:41.161
Rangers take their first lead
of the game, three to two,

01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:44.081
with 12½ minutes left
in the period.

01:31:44.206 --> 01:31:47.334
<i>And back comes Mystery.
Birdie Burns with Biebe.</i>

01:31:47.459 --> 01:31:49.836
<i>Burns shooting!</i>

01:31:50.003 --> 01:31:52.213
<i>- What the fuck was that?
- Biebe torpedoed into the net!</i>

01:31:52.296 --> 01:31:54.507
<i>That sets off
another scuffle.</i>

01:31:54.674 --> 01:31:57.051
<i>Hey, fuck you!</i>

01:31:57.176 --> 01:32:01.472
<i>He's back up
and rejoins the play.</i>

01:32:01.597 --> 01:32:03.599
<i>- Burns carries through centre ice.
- Pass it!</i>

01:32:03.724 --> 01:32:05.809
<i>He's got Banks on the wing. Pass to
the middle. Robertson catches it.</i>

01:32:05.934 --> 01:32:08.895
<i>Oh! What a hit!</i>

01:32:09.062 --> 01:32:11.564
<i>Birdie Burns is caught
trying to do it all by himself...</i>

01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:14.567
<i>and he got his wings trimmed
right there, man.</i>

01:32:14.692 --> 01:32:18.362
Birdie.
You don't pass, you sit.

01:32:18.529 --> 01:32:20.823
<i>Now Skank Marden carries out.</i>

01:32:20.906 --> 01:32:23.283
<i>Hooked by Neskorami,
Marden goes down.</i>

01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:25.911
<i>- Rangers score!
- What the hell was that?</i>

01:32:26.036 --> 01:32:28.413
<i>- Marden was hooked.
- Are you crazy?</i>

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.458
- How many times are you gonna
let him hook me?

01:32:32.542 --> 01:32:36.087
Back off!
Back off!

01:32:36.295 --> 01:32:41.008
<i>And another Ranger line comes
back warm from the locker room.</i>

01:32:41.175 --> 01:32:43.343
<i>Holt comes out
and sheriff's deputy...</i>

01:32:43.468 --> 01:32:46.012
<i>Bobby Michan goes in at goal.</i>

01:32:46.221 --> 01:32:47.973
<i>Saved!
Michan stacks the pads!</i>

01:32:48.098 --> 01:32:50.225
<i>And Mystery comes
streaking back the other way.</i>

01:32:50.266 --> 01:32:52.643
<i>The Winetkas lead the way.
They gain the zone.</i>

01:32:52.769 --> 01:32:55.104
<i>Back over the blue line.
And it's intercepted!</i>

01:32:55.187 --> 01:32:57.648
<i>- Jackson's on a breakaway!
- On center ice.</i>

01:32:57.815 --> 01:33:00.317
<i>- No way.
- And Lane chases.</i>

01:33:00.401 --> 01:33:02.861
<i>He... scores!</i>

01:33:02.986 --> 01:33:07.616
<i>Five unanswered goals,
and the Rangers are steamrolling.</i>

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:11.160
<i>- Come on, Mystery!
- Damn!</i>

01:33:11.286 --> 01:33:14.789
<i>We'll be right back
with the third period.</i>

01:33:34.891 --> 01:33:36.684
Different story
in the second period.

01:33:36.851 --> 01:33:39.520
The Rangers have all the momentum now.
Five straight goals.

01:33:39.687 --> 01:33:43.106
I feel really bad for these boys, Jimmy.
I really do.

01:33:43.273 --> 01:33:46.151
Nobody told them
it was just a show.

01:33:46.318 --> 01:33:49.028
<i>There's still a period to go.
Twenty minutes. Any hope?</i>

01:33:49.195 --> 01:33:54.158
- I hate to say it. They're done like dinner.
- Aw, bullshit.

01:33:54.325 --> 01:33:56.660
Hey, we're on the air.

01:34:07.879 --> 01:34:09.547
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

01:34:09.672 --> 01:34:12.717
We'll get our shots.
We're not out.

01:34:12.842 --> 01:34:15.219
Balls to the walls, huh?

01:34:17.304 --> 01:34:19.348
- You're gonna need some stitches, John.
- After.

01:34:19.473 --> 01:34:22.226
Oh, Jesus. Can't hold a stick.

01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:32.944
It might be broken.

01:34:33.069 --> 01:34:36.113
Well, tape it,
'cause I'm not coming out.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.743
- Tape it.
- We'll look at it after the game, all right?

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:49.959
- You all right, John?
- Yeah.

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:53.546
Here's what I want.
One man in, wings on wings.

01:34:53.713 --> 01:34:57.550
- Nobody pinches. Trap the neutral zone.
- Why? We're down.

01:34:57.675 --> 01:35:01.345
I want to keep the score close. As long
as it's not a rout, we go home winners.

01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:05.599
Now, if we gain the zone,
you get across the blue line, you dump.

01:35:05.724 --> 01:35:07.684
- Send in only the first guy.
- What are you talking about?

01:35:07.767 --> 01:35:10.770
- I'm talking about we're beaten.
- We're not beaten.

01:35:10.895 --> 01:35:12.730
I'm not beaten!

01:35:13.981 --> 01:35:17.693
We're in this game!

01:35:17.818 --> 01:35:20.779
- Anybody here
tired? - No. - No.

01:35:20.904 --> 01:35:24.408
- Anybody fuckin' tired?
- No!

01:35:24.574 --> 01:35:26.576
- Holt?
- I'm just warming up, Sheriff.

01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:28.370
- Connor?
- I'm ready, John.

01:35:28.495 --> 01:35:30.205
- Birdie, you with us?
- Yup.

01:35:30.413 --> 01:35:33.499
Good. The Rangers are starting
to breathe through their mouths.

01:35:33.583 --> 01:35:35.293
<i>Their strides
are getting shorter.</i>

01:35:35.418 --> 01:35:37.670
Do not give these guys
too much respect.

01:35:37.837 --> 01:35:40.714
<i>- They didn't pull a dog sled, did they?
- No.</i>

01:35:40.839 --> 01:35:43.008
- They didn't skate the river, did they?
- No.

01:35:43.133 --> 01:35:45.760
Forget about that fucking
circus out there.

01:35:45.886 --> 01:35:49.222
That's still black ice.
This is our pond.

01:35:49.347 --> 01:35:51.266
- You're goddamn right.
- That's right.

01:35:51.432 --> 01:35:56.645
- Biebe's right.
We gotta take it to these guys.

01:35:56.771 --> 01:35:58.689
Heads up!

01:36:04.361 --> 01:36:06.321
This is our pond.

01:36:10.909 --> 01:36:12.744
Nice assist.

01:36:14.245 --> 01:36:17.206
<i>- I will. I will.
- We gotta do it together, man.</i>

01:36:26.173 --> 01:36:28.883
<i>Mystery is hoping the cold
of night will stem this Ranger tide.</i>

01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:31.636
<i>- Get it, John!
- But the Rangers are right back on the attack.</i>

01:36:33.179 --> 01:36:35.848
<i>Oh!
And a huge hit by Biebe!</i>

01:36:35.973 --> 01:36:40.561
<i>It's payback time,
and that one's for Stevie Weeks.</i>

01:36:40.686 --> 01:36:43.313
<i>Face-off on the Rangers'end.
Rangers get the draw.</i>

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.608
<i>Cangrapoole along the boards.
Lane pitches, and the puck squirts free.</i>

01:36:46.691 --> 01:36:49.486
<i>- Jackson's got it!
- Eleven, pick him up!</i>

01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:51.654
Come on, boys.
Cover it!

01:36:51.779 --> 01:36:54.657
<i>He's gone on the breakaway.
This could really put Mystery away.</i>

01:36:54.824 --> 01:36:57.243
<i>They're chasing,
butJackson's all alone.</i>

01:36:57.451 --> 01:37:02.039
<i>- Come on!
- Jackson fakes and shoots!</i>

01:37:02.122 --> 01:37:04.458
<i>A huge save by Holt!</i>

01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:08.003
<i>Holt stood on his head.
I've never seen a save like that!</i>

01:37:08.169 --> 01:37:11.589
Great save, Holt.
Come on, guys.

01:37:11.714 --> 01:37:13.674
Come on, Tree. Let's go, baby.
Come on, Galin. Let's go now.

01:37:13.883 --> 01:37:16.177
<i>Face-off at the Mystery
blue line.</i>

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.512
<i>Rangers win the draw.
Back to Rory.</i>

01:37:18.637 --> 01:37:21.098
<i>- And both Winetkas forecheck.
- Take it in!</i>

01:37:21.223 --> 01:37:23.141
<i>Galin knocks the puck to brother Ben
and carries it into the zone.</i>

01:37:23.267 --> 01:37:25.143
<i>Connolly trails.
He has it in his sights.</i>

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:27.979
<i>He shoots...
Scores!</i>

01:37:28.146 --> 01:37:32.775
<i>And he rips the shot
over Gainer's glove!</i>

01:37:32.817 --> 01:37:36.362
Yeah! Ha!
Yeah!

01:37:36.529 --> 01:37:39.281
<i>- Goal by 29.
- All right, we're back in it, boys!</i>

01:37:44.369 --> 01:37:46.163
Wow, Johnny!

01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:49.999
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Let's go!

01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:54.462
<i>That makes it five to three,
and Mystery has a pulse again.</i>

01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:57.673
<i>But the Rangers
control the puck.</i>

01:37:57.798 --> 01:38:01.385
<i>Back to Wasson. He winds for the shot.
Marden drops to block.</i>

01:38:01.593 --> 01:38:04.304
<i>- Oh, my god.
Oh, man! Does that gotta hurt!</i>

01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:09.100
<i>- Oh, Mommy.
- He really took one in the siege for the team.</i>

01:38:09.225 --> 01:38:11.311
<i>Mystery gets the loose puck
and heads the other way.</i>

01:38:11.519 --> 01:38:13.563
<i>Now Marden is slow to get up.</i>

01:38:13.688 --> 01:38:16.232
<i>And Phil, you don't see a guy just
lie down in front of a Billy Wasson...</i>

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:19.318
<i>90-mile-an-hour slap shot
very often.</i>

01:38:19.443 --> 01:38:21.445
<i>Mystery is giving everything
they've got. This is great hockey.</i>

01:38:23.905 --> 01:38:25.824
Everybody in!

01:38:25.907 --> 01:38:27.867
As soon as you cross
the blue line,

01:38:27.993 --> 01:38:30.995
- Holt, you come, Skank, you go.
- Yeah.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.831
Three men on the puck.
Defense, you gotta pinch!

01:38:33.998 --> 01:38:35.625
Throw it at the net.
Everybody's gotta crash.

01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:37.877
- Come on, let's go!
- Right with you, sir.

01:38:38.002 --> 01:38:40.713
- Hang if you have to, Connor.
- Got it.

01:38:40.838 --> 01:38:43.215
Blow it out your ass.

01:38:43.382 --> 01:38:45.175
- Plenty of time. Plenty of time. Let's go!
- Come on, guys!

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:48.970
<i>1:26.
Two goals down.</i>

01:38:49.054 --> 01:38:51.681
- And time is running out for Mystery.
- Desperation time, Doug.

01:38:51.848 --> 01:38:53.724
Look for Burns
to pull their goalie.

01:38:53.808 --> 01:38:56.185
They want to get that extra attacker
into the play.

01:38:56.352 --> 01:39:01.482
Come on! It's not over!
Mystery! Mystery!

01:39:01.607 --> 01:39:04.359
<i>- Mystery! Mystery!
- Mystery! Mystery!</i>

01:39:04.568 --> 01:39:06.778
Let's rock, boys.
Let's get it going!

01:39:06.945 --> 01:39:10.865
<i>Mystery! Mystery!</i>

01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:13.117
<i>And Banks wins it.
Biebe carries.</i>

01:39:13.242 --> 01:39:15.745
<i>- And there goes Holt.
Six attackers. The net's empty.</i>

01:39:17.872 --> 01:39:20.290
<i>On the wing to Weeks. He gains the zone.</i>

01:39:20.374 --> 01:39:23.460
<i>And here comes Mystery.
Let's see how they work the puck.</i>

01:39:23.627 --> 01:39:27.130
<i>From right wing to right point,
down low to Birdie Burns.</i>

01:39:27.213 --> 01:39:30.383
<i>Here comes Burns, working for a shot.
He's gonna shoot.</i>

01:39:30.466 --> 01:39:32.552
<i>No, he passes the puck
to Biebe! Shoots!</i>

01:39:32.677 --> 01:39:35.388
- Scores!
- Yea!

01:39:35.554 --> 01:39:38.557
<i>Biebe scores off a great pass
from Birdie Burns.</i>

01:39:38.766 --> 01:39:42.686
<i>- Yeah!
- Five to four, Mystery down by one,</i>

01:39:42.769 --> 01:39:46.356
<i>and now, 43 seconds to play.</i>

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:50.777
<i>- It's not over yet!
- Who would have ever guessed it would get to this?</i>

01:39:50.944 --> 01:39:56.115
<i>- Did you see that?
- Mystery, Alaska, one goal away from tying the New York Rangers.</i>

01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:09.711
Come on!
One more! One more!

01:40:09.878 --> 01:40:12.171
Don't rush the shot.
Three men across the blue line.

01:40:12.338 --> 01:40:14.257
Skank, you in the middle.

01:40:14.382 --> 01:40:17.927
- Yeah.
- Work it down low, look for Connor. Don't rush it.

01:40:17.968 --> 01:40:20.346
Forty-three seconds,

01:40:20.471 --> 01:40:22.556
and then the rest
of your lives.

01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:25.559
Forty-three seconds.
You own that time.

01:40:25.684 --> 01:40:28.061
It's your time.
Am I right?

01:40:28.186 --> 01:40:30.063
- Right on!
- Take it! Take it!

01:40:30.146 --> 01:40:32.523
<i>Mystery's gonna keep
their goalie on the bench.</i>

01:40:32.648 --> 01:40:34.692
<i>Six on five,
with the empty net behind.</i>

01:40:34.817 --> 01:40:37.778
<i>They're going for it.
Everything's on the line!</i>

01:40:37.903 --> 01:40:39.905
<i>This is what this game's
all about.</i>

01:40:40.114 --> 01:40:44.159
<i>Rangers win the draw.
Robertson for the empty net!</i>

01:40:44.326 --> 01:40:46.661
<i>And he just missed it!</i>

01:40:52.208 --> 01:40:54.710
Plenty of time!
Plenty of time!

01:40:54.877 --> 01:40:57.004
<i>Biebe slowing it down
behind the net.</i>

01:40:57.088 --> 01:40:59.673
Stay high.
All the way in, Stevie.

01:40:59.757 --> 01:41:01.592
<i>Now Weeks takes it
and carries it on down the wing.</i>

01:41:01.717 --> 01:41:04.970
<i>This kid still has got the jets.
- Yes! Yes!</i>

01:41:05.095 --> 01:41:07.013
<i>They'll be working
to free up Connor Banks in the slot.</i>

01:41:07.138 --> 01:41:11.184
<i>Here comes Mystery.
Banks trying to get free.</i>

01:41:11.309 --> 01:41:13.644
<i>Biebe's got it!
Here comes Connor Banks!</i>

01:41:13.769 --> 01:41:15.813
<i>He's got a shot!</i>

01:43:13.421 --> 01:43:15.256
Wow.

01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:08.722
<i>Mystery! Mystery!</i>

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.854
- Good game.
- Good game.

01:44:17.021 --> 01:44:20.065
- Good game.
- Good game.

01:44:20.232 --> 01:44:23.068
Nice game.

01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:04.189
Great game, son.

01:45:12.905 --> 01:45:14.782
Great game, Judge.

01:45:33.925 --> 01:45:36.093
- Stevie!
- Hey.

01:45:36.218 --> 01:45:38.429
- I can't believe you're leaving.
- I know.

01:45:42.349 --> 01:45:44.184
We never even had sex.

01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:48.396
I'll be back
in a couple of months.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:50.773
You better.

01:45:55.278 --> 01:45:57.780
- For real?
- Can you believe it?

01:46:01.575 --> 01:46:03.619
- Oh, man!
- Yeah, I know.

01:46:03.744 --> 01:46:05.787
Your little garden
is gonna have fun.

01:46:05.912 --> 01:46:08.415
There's some serious turnip to hoe
in New York City.

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:11.000
I'm not going to the New York Rangers
right away.

01:46:11.167 --> 01:46:14.420
They're sending me to Binghamton,
which is like the AHL.

01:46:14.503 --> 01:46:17.131
Yeah!

01:46:17.339 --> 01:46:19.425
- Stevie Weeks too?
- Yeah.

01:46:19.591 --> 01:46:21.635
Both to Binghamton, huh?
Two-way contracts.

01:46:21.718 --> 01:46:23.637
To start with.
They'll make it.

01:46:23.762 --> 01:46:26.223
They won't be coming back.

01:46:26.348 --> 01:46:29.017
Shame they couldn't take
Skank with them, huh?

01:46:29.184 --> 01:46:31.436
Well, good for you, John. You'll be
back in the Saturday game then.

01:46:31.519 --> 01:46:34.355
Uh-huh. Yeah. Until you can
find a way to bump me again.

01:46:38.734 --> 01:46:40.819
All right, folks.
Gotta go.

01:46:40.944 --> 01:46:43.196
Love to stay,
but, uh, gotta go.

01:46:43.322 --> 01:46:45.198
- You're not going on the helicopter?
- No.

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:48.952
There's no room on that thing. I got
a car waiting to take me to Fairbanks.

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:52.288
- Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

01:46:52.413 --> 01:46:54.248
Thank you.

01:47:00.838 --> 01:47:03.674
Yeah.

01:47:03.799 --> 01:47:05.801
I'm gonna say goodbye
to Connor.

01:47:11.973 --> 01:47:13.933
He's a...

01:47:14.058 --> 01:47:15.935
You got a great
family there.

01:47:17.353 --> 01:47:20.439
- I do.
- Yeah.

01:47:20.564 --> 01:47:24.026
Well, we don't have to say goodbye,
really. I hope to be back in June.

01:47:24.151 --> 01:47:26.236
Don't bring the Yankees.

01:47:45.378 --> 01:47:47.380
I love you.

01:47:47.505 --> 01:47:49.382
Bye.

01:47:49.549 --> 01:47:51.342
Bye.

01:47:54.512 --> 01:47:56.389
John.

01:48:18.784 --> 01:48:22.204
<i>Bye.</i>

01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:07.412
So that blocked shot
must have really hurt, huh?

01:49:08.913 --> 01:49:11.207
Not too bad.

01:49:11.332 --> 01:49:15.002
'Cause I have three hours
till my crew's ready to leave.
