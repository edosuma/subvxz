00:01.293 --> 00:05.161
CARTER: It was Launch Day
in Eureka. Black holes started
popping up all over town.

00:05.714 --> 00:06.874
WOMAN: No!
That sucks.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.673
CARTER: But as soon as
we solved that problem,
things got worse.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.220
Someone else is controlling
this launch.

00:13.597 --> 00:16.339
CARTER: Beverly Barlowe and
the Consortium had kidnapped
the crew of the Astraeus

00:16.517 --> 00:20.556
and put them in
a computer matrix Eureka
to steal their genius ideas.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.471
Like creating
a particle netting gun
to slay a fake dragon.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.936
The crew believed that
four years had passed
and a lot had changed.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.441
Carter stole my girlfriend.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.775
The computer versions of Jo
and me were raising
Allison's kids together.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.564
And all the virtual characters
were programmed

00:33.742 --> 00:35.733
to hide the truth
from the kidnapped crew.

00:35.911 --> 00:39.449
I don't think
that this relationship
is going to work out.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.113
CARTER: No matter
what the cost.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.667
I'm so sorry
you said that.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.413
BEVERLY: You're killing her.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.753
CARTER:
Senator Wen was behind it all.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.165
What?
So, I wasjacked in
to get the crew out.

00:51.343 --> 00:56.087
Which got a little awkward
with fake Jo and me.
But we took the program down.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.797
We broke the matrix.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.135
And we got everyone out.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.725
But adjusting to reality
won't be so easy.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.476
Holly must be worried sick.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.480
And for some,
life will never
be the same.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.022
You could at least
let me help.

Well, I...

KEVIN: He knows I have school
today, right?

01:24.543 --> 01:28.206
Actually, you don't. I talked
to your teachers and told them
you weren't coming in today.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.545
Another ditch day? Sweet!

01:30.716 --> 01:32.832
I thought we could hang out
as a family.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.716
Hey, can we go
to Copernicus Park, please?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.423
Yes.
But you are not getting me on
that skateboard again.

to the park today.
You coming?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.485
Oh, I, you...

01:55.407 --> 01:57.523
You know what? I can't.
I've got to head over to G.D.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.032
There's some stuff
that I've got to take care of.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.817

SARAH: My apologies, Sheriff.
l'm experiencing some
minor RF interference.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.551
I'll run diagnostics.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.802
Something wrong with my girl?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.964
No,

this morning.

that we don't
want you there.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.424
Nothing.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.354
This is so not okay.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.267
Finally!

09:30.445 --> 09:34.313
Would you please tell
Mr. Donovan that
this is a research facility,

09:34.491 --> 09:35.776
not a storage locker?

09:35.950 --> 09:36.905
We're cataloging all the
recovered equipment

09:37.077 --> 09:38.032
from the neural
networking lab.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.739
I've got orders signed
by the director himself.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.744
Oh, please.
The director
just lost his girlfriend.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.577
He would sign anything
you put in front of him.
Even a self-destruct order.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.616
Hey, that's enough.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.671
Oh, wow. This is cool.
What is it?

09:51.841 --> 09:55.254
It's a particle netting gun.
I designed that
in virtual Eureka.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.216
Wen used the blueprints
and a 3D printer, I guess,
to make a functional model.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.301
You actually slayed
a dragon with that.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.261
Hmm.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.892
Well, the other you did.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.474
Okay, seriously.

not telling me?

going with that?

are back to normal.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.651
I don't know
what just happened.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.483
You're an idiot.
That's what just happened.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.397
What was that thing?
It's iFire.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.066
It's an advanced
fire-fighting technology.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.407
It seeks out the energy
from heat sources and
then dissipates it in seconds.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.947
So, fight fire with fire?
Except it's not fire.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.367
It's actually a series of
programmable nanobots that
operate on a unique frequency

11:10.545 --> 11:12.160
that I can control
with this remote.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.750
Okay. But it's a fire stopper,
not a fire starter.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.301
Well, I've actually
been playing around
with the programming

11:17.468 --> 11:19.959
to see if it can produce
heat as well as absorb it.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.299
You know,
like for controlled burns.
Which means...

11:22.473 --> 11:24.759
Fire starter.
Oh, awesome.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.311
Hey, come on!
I mean, it worked fine
until today.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.140
Well, what would make
it go haywire?
I don't know.

11:31.107 --> 11:35.646
Frequency interference, maybe?
I mean, it doesn't act
without instruction.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.027
So, it must have
gotten a signal
from somewhere.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.029
We can track it
with G.D.'s internal sensors.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.363
No, that won't work.
It generates a negligible
amount of heat on its own.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.616
It won't show up
on any sensors.

11:44.787 --> 11:49.702
So, we have a fireball
on the loose and no way
to track it, that's great.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.367
Actually,
I prefer the term firefly.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.044
lts mobility is its
defining characteristic.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.049

12:06.643 --> 12:08.429

12:11.606 --> 12:13.312
This is the best idea
you've ever had.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.849
Aside from all the times
you saved the town
from annihilation.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.647

12:18.821 --> 12:20.402
Piece of cake.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.403
How do you know this stuff?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.325
My nephew
skates competitively.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.532
Well, at least, he used to
until he broke his ankle.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.118
Great, that's very comforting.
Thank you. Thank you.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.498
Sorry.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.371
Hey, Kevin! Can you come
take Jenna on the swing
for a sec?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.961
Carter told me
I could find you here.
I hope you don't mind.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.387
Oh, of course not.
What's going on?

12:45.682 --> 12:47.343
Hi.
Thanks.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.723
Henry?

12:49.185 --> 12:52.677
Yeah. You know,
it's notjust him.
I mean, it's everything.

12:52.855 --> 12:57.394
I guess I'm having
a little bit of a harder time
readjusting than I expected.

12:57.568 --> 13:01.857
(SIGHS) I know what you mean.
I feel we've been gone a year.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.150
Or four.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.564
(CHUCKLES)

13:04.742 --> 13:06.733
You really need
to talk to him.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.151
And tell him what?

13:08.329 --> 13:12.368
| sort of killed you? But
you were trying to kill me,
so you totally had it coming?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.373
That wasn't your Henry.
I know.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.160
And logically, I understand.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.297
But we didn't just witness
this alternate reality.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.128
We lived it.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.589
Emotionally, I'm having a hard
time telling them apart.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.880
Try living with your
boyfriend's matrix girlfriend.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.594
That has got to be weird.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.178
Yeah, weird doesn't
quite cut it.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.265
But you have nothing to worry
about because Jack never
looked at Jo that way.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.853
Well, maybe not before.
But now, after he's seen
what we've seen?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.392
How could he not?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.935
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

13:42.905 --> 13:45.282
They're recalling

13:45.450 --> 13:47.406
Some sort of fireball
on the loose.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.780
Welcome home.
No kidding.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.452
Kevin. Come on.
We've got to go.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.002
Here, fireball.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.048
Here, fireball, fireball.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.297
Where are you?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.178
See anything?

14:17.732 --> 14:19.017
Sorry about that.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.398
Is it gone?

14:21.569 --> 14:24.481
Uh... We think so.
Yeah, what happened?

14:24.655 --> 14:27.317
Everyone ran.
That's what happened.
Totally abandoned me.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.447
Left me to die.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.199
With the fire?
What happened with the fire?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.112
lt extinguished the flames
in our Bunsen burners.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.780
And it took out
the electrical panel
controlling the lights.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.573
Well, maybe it's
not so dangerous.

(ALARM BLARING)

14:40.129 --> 14:42.336
You had to say it.
I know. I know!

14:47.595 --> 14:48.801
Hey, guys.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.055
Oh! Get it! Hey! Hey!

14:52.225 --> 14:54.181
JO: Fargo, is anyone else
on fire?
FARGO: Nope.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.305
You okay?

14:57.897 --> 15:02.266
Yeah, fantastic. How are you?
You guys
look like Ghostbusters.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.062
They do, don't they?
What?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.569
Hey, wait!
You know, that was
Holly's favorite movie.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.606
Which, by the way, I have been
looking for her everywhere.
Have you guys seen her?

15:09.784 --> 15:11.615
Have we seen Holly?
Yeah.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.118
Fargo, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:14.288 --> 15:18.748
What? Oh, you mean this?
No, no. It's cool.
It was hot, but didn't hurt.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.701
It was actually
kind of exciting.

15:21.879 --> 15:22.629
Is it still in there?
No,

15:22.797 --> 15:24.753
it left after
it blew the place up.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.755
Okay. We've got to head
this thing off at the pass.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.632
Yeah, it seems to
be going down level by level.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.134
Parrish said that
it's attracted
to heat sources.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.886
What's the bottom level?
The fusion reactor.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.014
Hey! Who you going to call?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.684
All right, here we go.
Almost there.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.108
Almost there. Almost there.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.693
In the jar.

15:57.957 --> 15:58.946
Got you!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.207

Outside.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.921
Perfect.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.425
Okay, G.D. is safe.
But we need to alert the town.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.588
If these things are looking
for energy sources,
we need to minimize outputs.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.178
Already done, Andy's
coordinating the shutdown
of all heat sources.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.930
Well, how do we track
the fireflies if they
don't register on sensors?

17:02.104 --> 17:05.596
We may not be able to
see them, but we can guess
where they're going.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.766
We can trace
heat signatures via infrared.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.981
Yeah, they'll go after
the most powerful
sources first.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.109
I don't think
everyone got the memo,
Shenﬁ.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.024
Seriously, is that a joke?

17:19.789 --> 17:21.029
What's your problem?
You!

17:21.207 --> 17:25.041
You're my problem.
You're everyone's problem.
This is all your fault.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.953
If it wasn't for your
incompetence, none of this
would have happened.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.337
I mean, the big surprise.
Right, guys?

17:30.508 --> 17:33.250
Another lsaac Parrish
experiment failed.
Must be Tuesday.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.337
Fargo.
What?

17:34.512 --> 17:38.096
What's with you? An hour ago,
you're making jokes.
Now, you're a raving lunatic.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.631
Oh, you want to see a luna...

17:39.809 --> 17:40.798
Mmm-mmm.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.726
What did you do? Fargo!

17:49.610 --> 17:51.566
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't, you idiot.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.443
It's a trauma patch.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.650
I got it from the guys
in the bereavement lab.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.486
lt's helping me cope
with my grief.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.651
Oh, yeah.
You are coping, all right.

17:59.829 --> 18:00.818
Anger!

18:00.997 --> 18:04.581
You're in the anger phase.
Before, you were in,
what? Denial?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.251
Cheating the stages of grief?

18:06.419 --> 18:10.128
Oh. Congratulations!
One step behind Carter,
as always.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.913
Hey.
It is not worth it.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.336
You're right.
Fireball on the loose.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.547
Actually, it's not a fireball.
It's a...

18:17.722 --> 18:20.509
BOTH: We know!
Yes. We know.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.854
So, how do we trap
these things?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.512
I'm thinking high voltage
plasma generators.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.227
We can use them
to lure the fireballs...

18:30.401 --> 18:32.892
Fireflies away from town.
Okay.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.277
I will rig up a second remote
and we can use it
to control them

18:35.448 --> 18:36.403
when they get within range.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.360
How do we know
the remote will work?
It didn't last time.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.274
That's because
there was signal interference.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.613
From what?
Look.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.951
All I know is everything was
working fine until he started
trucking all his junk in here.

18:46.125 --> 18:50.710
It's possible that
the equipment was radiating
some sort of energy signature.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.541
I haven't even had time
to examine it, yet.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.127
But the remotes will work
when we get them outside
of G.D. right?

18:55.301 --> 18:56.632
Yeah. Theoretically.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.178
I hate that word.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.011
All right, let's pair up.
Get this thing done.
Do you...

19:04.185 --> 19:06.471
I mean, I didn't mean,
like, pair up...

19:06.646 --> 19:09.058
I mean, I wasn't
necessarily putting you...
There's more...

19:09.231 --> 19:11.517
Safety in numbers.
Yeah. Yeah. For...

19:13.235 --> 19:15.226
So, this is weird.
Yep.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.021
I'm going to call
in Henry for backup.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.442
Come on.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.941
You haven't told her,
have you?

19:22.703 --> 19:24.409
It's not important.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.157
No, you're right.
Staring at her
and acting all creepy?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.370
Much better plan.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.121
Hey, Carter...
I mean Jack. Sorry.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.755
Still getting used
to it again.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.167
Okay. Where are you?
Just dropped the kids off
and I'm heading your way.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.505
Turn around.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.097
What? Why?

19:42.264 --> 19:45.051
We have two fireballs headed
into town. They're going
after heat sources.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.090

19:47.687 --> 19:49.678
Yeah, I think
ljust found one.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.275
lt's following me.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.785
It's going
after the combustion engine.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.954
What's it going to do
when it finds it?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.665
I don't know.
Well, I'm not waiting
to find out.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.336
Allie, what's happening?

20:23.806 --> 20:25.342
It's okay. I'm okay.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.639
It's on the move.
Oh. I'm coming to get you.

20:30.813 --> 20:34.726
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'll call Andy, he'll give
me a ride to the Smart House.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.312
You just need to stop this
thing before it gets
out of hand.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.397
ANDY: All of Eureka
is powering down.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.312
I am not canceling the party.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.482
We're not asking you to.
We just need you to
turn off the ovens.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.321
Then, what am
I supposed to serve?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.907

Excuse me for a minute.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.045
Go for Andy.

Hmm.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.940
Mind if I ask you something?

21:24.867 --> 21:27.028
I don't know any more than you
about what happened
in the matrix.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.784
So, I'm not the only one.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.366
Been feeling like you're
on the outside looking in?

21:31.540 --> 21:34.703
Yeah. Why won't they just
tell us whatever it is?

21:36.504 --> 21:38.460

that Carter won't look me
in the eye,

at him for something,

21:41.133 --> 21:44.125
and Allison wants me
out of the house.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.466
Every time I try asking Grace,
she just won't let me get
close enough.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.677
Yeah, I heard that
we were bad in the matrix,
but...

21:52.520 --> 21:54.556
How bad were we, really?

21:58.526 --> 21:59.561

until it gets closer.

just a little too easy?

22:24.426 --> 22:25.415
(GRUNTING)

22:30.057 --> 22:31.422
I got it.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.181
Oh, enough.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.268
Stop acting like
I stole your girlfriend.

Well, you did. Sort of.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.142
No, I didn't, actually.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.933
So, you didn't kiss her?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.026
l was playing a part.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.356
You didn't see her naked?

22:45.531 --> 22:47.522
Oh, what are you, six?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.736
Zane, I'm in love
with Allison.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.821
Well, the other Carter was
with Allison, too.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.237
But as soon as she was out
of the picture...
None of that is real.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.576
Beverly didn't
just make the stuff up.
Yes, she did.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.957
I looked at the neural
network's operating system.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.585
She used
a probability algorithm
based on who we are

given a certain set
of circumstances.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.051
You realize I have no idea
what that means, right?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.212
It means if you'd never
rescued us, you'd end up
with Jo, is what it means.

No, I'm not. It's actually...

Give me that. Give me.

23:31.702 --> 23:32.862
No. Here.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.397
I'm thinking no.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.571
We're not going to make it.

24:15.746 --> 24:19.489
We're going to be fine.
We just need to figure out
more reliable way to trap it.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.827
What's the point?

24:21.460 --> 24:24.668
If this doesn't destroy us,
some other disaster will.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.457
lt's inevitable.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.795
What's with Fargo?
Depression stage.
I'll explain later.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.507
lt's fate.
All these crazy experiments.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.675
It was bound to end
at some point.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.841
I think we make
our own fate, Fargo.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.721
You're adorable.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.012
But wrong.

24:43.190 --> 24:46.227
Everything is predetermined.
Just like you and Jo.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.851
What's he talking about?
Nothing.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.406
You and Carter were doing it
in the matrix.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.858
What?

24:53.033 --> 24:56.116
Yes. But let's talk
about that later. Huh?

24:56.286 --> 24:58.447
Huh? Yeah. Uh-huh.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.495
It's going to be okay, buddy.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.827
You promise?
Yeah, I promise.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.374
Would somebody tell me
what's going on?
Our trap failed.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.254
That's what's going on.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.042
Okay. I don't understand why
ours worked and theirs didn't.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.257
We were using
the secondary remote.
Now, if Parrish is right,

25:16.432 --> 25:20.095
that the signal interference
was coming from the neural
networking equipment,

25:20.269 --> 25:22.931
then the primary remote
must be permanently damaged.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.096
I'll need to test both
to be sure.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.230
I don't get it.
Half the time
it puts out fires,

25:27.401 --> 25:28.607
and the other half,
it blows stuff up.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.688
It's like
it can't make up its mind.

25:30.863 --> 25:34.731
All right. If I was a
schizophrenic fireball,
where would I be?

25:36.452 --> 25:37.282
Whoa.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.197
Everything should be
powered down by now.

shut off the reactor?

to the neural network.

of biphasic delta waves,
also known as zeta waves.

33:48.401 --> 33:52.019

we're emitting radio signals?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.900
In a way, connecting
to the neural network,

somehow disrupted
our brains'
normal electrical activity.

33:58.245 --> 33:58.984

the iFire's programming
went haywire.

from heat sources,
it ignited them.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.573
I'm thinking ice cream.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.280
Very funny.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.987
Surprise me.
Okay.

39:38.626 --> 39:39.832
Look...

39:40.003 --> 39:42.085
If I've been a jerk
the last few days...

39:42.255 --> 39:44.871
Hey. Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to him.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.677
Yeah.
That's not going to happen.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.596
You know, this
little jealousy thing is...

39:54.767 --> 39:57.179
Oh, I'm not...
It's quite cute.

39:58.104 --> 40:02.017
All right, fine. I'm jealous.
What do you want from me?

40:02.609 --> 40:04.474
I'm just not sure, yet.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.059
Really?

40:07.572 --> 40:09.984
Because you seemed
pretty happy when I got back.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.318
Zane.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.778
You know,
I feel like there's some stuff
that I've got to figure out.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.695
You know, maybe ljust,
maybe I need a little bit
more time.

40:16.873 --> 40:18.329
Well, too bad.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.287
We either figure this thing
out together,
or we end it right now.

40:22.462 --> 40:26.250
But all this back and
forth is killing me.
I can't do it anymore.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.938
So is that goodbye then, or...

40:44.817 --> 40:46.478
VINCENT: Excuse me.

40:47.612 --> 40:48.522
Enjoy.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.060
Cheaters never win.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.443
That's probably why
I am stuck down
in non-lethal weapons

41:30.613 --> 41:34.572
and you are up here
in this big, stupid,
ugly office.

41:50.717 --> 41:53.709
She told me that
she wasn't into role-playing.

41:57.098 --> 42:01.057
Well, in her defense,
you were playing the part
of an ass-hat.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.219
Touche.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.232
Do you want to play?

42:24.333 --> 42:26.460
Only if I get to be an elf.

42:27.754 --> 42:30.587
Well, that's fine with me.
I'm not a girl.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.250
Subtitling : C.M.C.
