02:27.897 --> 02:32.818
Manhattan Island derives its name
from its earliest enhabitants...

02:33.069 --> 02:35.404
...the Manhattan Indians.

02:35.738 --> 02:40.534
They were a peaceful tribe,
setting traps, fishing, hunting.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.245
There was a custom among them:

02:43.538 --> 02:47.166
Every July, when the heat
became unbearable...

02:47.375 --> 02:51.086
...they would send their wives
and children away.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.422
Up the river to the highlands...

02:53.715 --> 02:57.759
...or, if they could afford it,
to the seashore.

02:58.052 --> 03:02.598
The husbands remained behind
to attend to business:

03:02.849 --> 03:07.269
Setting traps, fishing and hunting.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.529
Our story has nothing whatsoever
to do with Indians.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.241
It plays 500 years later.

03:21.451 --> 03:26.622
Portland Rockland
Plymouth and Bar Harbor.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.749
Departing at 6:30....

03:28.958 --> 03:33.253
We brought up the subject
to show how nothing has changed.

03:33.463 --> 03:37.299
Manhattan wives and children
are still sent away in the summer.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.761
Husbands remain behind
to attend to business:

03:40.970 --> 03:43.972
Setting traps, fishing and hunting.

03:44.265 --> 03:48.727
We want you to meet a typical
Manhattan husband.

03:48.978 --> 03:54.816
This is Mr. Richard Sherman,
his wife, Helen, and son, Ricky.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.986
Ricky, what are you doing?

03:58.238 --> 04:02.157
He's an interplanetary spy.
I blasted him into dust.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.828
Cut it out. You're going to Maine,
not to Mars. Goodbye, Helen.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.791
-Goodbye, Richard.
-Why can't Daddy come up with us?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.921
-Daddy has to stay and make money.
-Don't worry. I'll be fine.

04:16.172 --> 04:20.300
-How will I get my allowance?
-I'll mail it to you.

04:20.510 --> 04:24.304
You promised to eat properly
and not smoke.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.849
And you promised not to drink.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.353
-I'll call you tonight at 10.
-Goodbye, Helen.

04:31.604 --> 04:35.691
Goodbye, Ricky. Let me kiss you.

04:35.858 --> 04:39.444
-Take that thing off.
-He's shutting off my oxygen!

04:39.696 --> 04:42.114
Come on, we'll miss the train.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.871
Helen, Ricky, the paddle!
You forgot the paddle!

04:50.123 --> 04:53.875
-Ticket, mister?
-My son forgot the paddle.

04:54.127 --> 04:59.548
Sorry, only those holding tickets
admitted through the gates.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.063
Oh, no, not me.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.733
And I'm not gonna smoke either.

05:18.026 --> 05:23.238
Look at them. Awful. The train
isn't even out of the station.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.993
Gotta get back to the office.
Man, is this hot!

05:29.245 --> 05:32.414
A few more facts
about Mr. Sherman:

05:32.707 --> 05:35.584
He works for a publishing firm,
Brady & Company.

05:35.835 --> 05:40.547
They publish those pocket editions,
two bits in any drugstore.

05:40.757 --> 05:45.719
Old Mr. Brady is the boss,
but Mr. Sherman is the key man.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.597
He keeps the whole operation together.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.933
In the 25-cent book business,
you can sell anything.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.936
Even the old, dreary classics.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.856
The trick is to soup up the title...

05:58.107 --> 06:01.276
...and get an interesting cover.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.780
It's all a question of imagination...

06:04.947 --> 06:08.450
...and Mr. Sherman has a lot
of imagination.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.289
That'll be all, Miss Morris.

06:16.959 --> 06:21.129
Oh, no, not me. Not me.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.300
And I'm not gonna smoke either.

06:26.135 --> 06:30.138
Some husbands run wild
because their wives are away.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.474
Do anything they want.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.894
Like Charlie Lederer.
Annie was gone two days...

06:36.145 --> 06:38.647
...when Charlie got himself
tattooed.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.567
Green dragon on his chest,
butterfly on the shoulders.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.405
Not me. Oh, no, work, work--

06:47.115 --> 06:51.159
I'll work till 6,
then have dinner at the saloon--

06:51.411 --> 06:55.497
No! No saloon, no drinking
like Dr. Summers said.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.626
I know, I'll try
that vegetarian restaurant.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.254
Health food, that's the stuff.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.174
The human body
is a very delicate machine.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.261
You can't run it on martinis
and goulash.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.847
Especially in this hot weather.

07:13.015 --> 07:17.185
-Miss, may I have the check, please?
-Yes, sir.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.857
Let's see. We had the special,
the soybean hamburger...

07:22.150 --> 07:23.859
...with French-fried soybeans.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.862
Soybean sherbet and peppermint tea.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.197
I had a cocktail to start.

07:29.490 --> 07:33.034
Yes, we had the sauerkraut juice
on the rocks.

07:33.327 --> 07:37.956
You'll be proud to know that the meal
was only 260 calories.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.708
I am proud.

07:40.042 --> 07:43.462
That'll be $1.27.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.215
-Keep the change.
-We don't permit tipping.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.135
I can put it in our nudist camp fund.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.554
-You do that.
-Oh, thank you, sir.

07:52.805 --> 07:57.350
It's a worthy cause. We must
bring the message to the people.

07:57.560 --> 08:02.564
To unmask our suffocating bodies
and let them breathe again.

08:02.899 --> 08:07.402
Without clothes
there'd be no sickness and no war.

08:07.695 --> 08:11.573
Can you imagine two armies
on the battlefield...

08:11.824 --> 08:14.075
...no uniforms, completely nude?

08:14.368 --> 08:19.080
No way of telling friend from foe,
all brothers together.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.376
Just a moment, sir.
You forgot your paddle.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.254
Thank you.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.852
I like this house.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.357
Why does Helen want to move
into one of those...

08:45.608 --> 08:48.443
...buildings out of
Riot in Cellblock 11?

08:48.611 --> 08:51.613
So much nicer here.
Just three apartments.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.782
Ours, Kaufmans upstairs...

08:54.033 --> 08:59.037
...and two guys on the top,
interior decorators or something.

09:10.967 --> 09:15.303
It's peaceful with everybody gone.
Sure is peaceful.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.140
No Howdy Doody. No Captain Video.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.603
No smell of cooking.
No "What happened at the office?"

09:23.813 --> 09:28.650
I shot Mr. Brady in the head,
made violent love to Miss Morris...

09:28.901 --> 09:34.906
...and set fire to 300,000 copies of
Little Women. That's what happened.

09:36.242 --> 09:41.413
What can happen at the office?
It sure is peaceful.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.422
"Use the opener, Richard."

10:04.437 --> 10:07.647
"Carbonated water,
citric acid, corn syrup...

10:07.898 --> 10:10.358
...artificial raspberry flavoring...

10:10.610 --> 10:13.570
...vegetable colors and preservative."

10:13.821 --> 10:17.324
Why is this stuff better for you...

10:17.575 --> 10:20.577
...than a little scotch
and a twist of lemon?

10:20.828 --> 10:22.704
I'd really like to know.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.875
Helen's gonna call at 10.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.545
I guess I better do a little reading.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.507
I brought Dr. Brubaker's
manuscript home with me--

10:41.140 --> 10:43.183
Ricky!

10:43.434 --> 10:48.438
Okay, where is it?
Where is the other one?

10:48.689 --> 10:52.108
I know it's lurking here somewhere
to get me.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.528
Where is Captain Video's
other roller skate?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.076
Now, who's that?

11:16.550 --> 11:19.678
-Yes, what is it?
-I'm sorry to bother you.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.473
I forgot my key,
so I had to ring your bell.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.726
It's perfectly all right.

11:28.145 --> 11:32.148
Anytime. Anything else
I can do for you?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.776
Would you mind pressing it again?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.445
My fan's caught in the door.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.699
Oh, of course.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.327
-Thanks.
-Do you live in our building?

11:44.578 --> 11:48.331
In the Kaufmans' apartment.
They're in Europe.

11:48.624 --> 11:53.128
I know you'll be happy here.
It's a very quiet building.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.881
No dogs, no children,
just two interior decorators.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.259
And you, and of course, me.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.639
-You all right?
-Oh, sure, fine.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.349
Well, good night.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.477
Good night.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.487
Well, now.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.493
Maybe I should have
asked her in for a drink.

12:25.745 --> 12:30.290
Make her feel at home.
After all, we're one big family here.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.754
Oh, no, no.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.821
I've got to get to work
on the Brubaker book.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.700
I'm gonna talk to him
about it tomorrow, so I better.

13:05.951 --> 13:10.205
Of Man and the Unconscious,
by Dr. Ludwig Brubaker.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.581
Some title.

13:11.874 --> 13:16.044
We'll have to soup this one up,
that's for sure.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.594
Ten o'clock.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.348
Helen's not gonna call till 10:00.

13:28.682 --> 13:32.936
I hope this thing
keeps me awake till 10:00.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.065
Chapter three:

13:37.316 --> 13:40.443
"The Repressed Urge
in the Middle-Aged Male.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.363
Its Roots and Its Consequences."

13:44.907 --> 13:47.867
Helen has a lot of nerve
calling me at 10:00.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.204
It shows a definite lack of trust.

13:51.497 --> 13:56.209
What does she think I'm gonna do?
Start smoking? Get drunk?

13:56.502 --> 14:01.297
Or tattooed? Charlie....
Big, green dragon.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.510
I bet she thinks I'll have
girls up here.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.345
That's terrible.

14:07.596 --> 14:12.517
Seven years we've been married.
I've never done anything like that.

14:12.768 --> 14:18.022
Don't think I couldn't have either.
Because I could have, plenty.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.317
Plenty.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.906
Don't laugh, Helen.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.618
I happen to be very attractive
to women.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.247
You're attractive to me,
but I'm used to you.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.876
This isn't a thing one likes
to tell his wife...

14:38.127 --> 14:43.464
...but women have been throwing
themselves at me for years.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.635
That's right, beautiful ones,
plenty of them.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.347
-Acres and acres of them.
-Name one.

14:51.599 --> 14:56.352
It's hard just offhand,
but there have been plenty of them.

14:56.770 --> 15:00.565
You asked for it.
Take my secretary, for instance.

15:00.816 --> 15:05.653
To you, she's just Miss Morris,
a piece of office furniture.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.072
Ten fingers to type my letters.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.950
Well, let me tell you.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.454
-Did you type this letter?
-Yes, Mr. Sherman.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.166
There are six errors
in the first paragraph.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.543
What is the matter with you?

15:20.794 --> 15:25.381
-What's the matter with you?
-I'll tell you what's the matter.

15:25.633 --> 15:30.428
I'm in love with you.
I have been since the day I came here.

15:30.679 --> 15:34.390
Deeply, madly, desperately,
all-consumingly.

15:34.683 --> 15:38.144
And to you I'm nothing,
just a piece of furniture.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.147
Ten fingers to type your letters with.

15:41.398 --> 15:46.277
Mr. Sherman, take a look at me.
I'm a woman, do you hear?

15:46.528 --> 15:49.489
With flesh and blood
and nerves and feelings!

15:49.740 --> 15:55.119
I'm in love with you.
I need you, I want you. I want you....

16:00.834 --> 16:03.294
That will be all, Miss Morris.

16:15.849 --> 16:20.979
You remember that torn shirt, Helen?
Now you know how it happened.

16:22.439 --> 16:27.777
It got torn at the laundry, that's
how it happened. What an imagination!

16:28.404 --> 16:31.239
You don't realize this
about women and me:

16:31.490 --> 16:34.200
I walk into a room
and they sense it.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.912
I arouse something in them,
I bother them.

16:38.205 --> 16:42.709
It's a kind of animal thing I've got.
It's quite extraordinary.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.254
The only extraordinary thing
is your imagination.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.757
Last winter when I had
my appendix out...

16:49.925 --> 16:52.218
...do you remember the nurse?

16:52.469 --> 16:56.556
That sweet, little old lady
with the gray hair?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.058
That was the day nurse.

16:59.268 --> 17:04.355
You never saw the night nurse,
a certain Miss Finch.

17:04.565 --> 17:09.027
Poor Miss Finch.
She fought it as long as she could.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.613
-But then one night....
-Richard!

17:12.865 --> 17:16.492
Miss Finch, please, not again tonight.

17:18.494 --> 17:20.621
We have so little time.

17:20.914 --> 17:26.127
Soon they'll take out your stitches
and I'll have lost you forever.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.466
Please, Miss Finch.
There is such a thing as ethics.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.594
Remember, you are a registered nurse.

17:34.845 --> 17:40.183
Ethics? Once I had ethics.
Once I was young.

17:40.476 --> 17:45.313
Once I had ideals. I was registered!
And then you happened.

17:45.564 --> 17:50.276
Miss Finch, for five nights now
you've been taking my pulse.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.530
Have you never noticed
this simple band of gold?

17:54.782 --> 18:00.161
You've bothered me since they wheeled
you into the operating room.

18:00.370 --> 18:05.249
I can't understand it.
There's this animal thing about you.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.587
Please, Miss Finch, my adhesions.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.591
Let's crash out of here.
Let's steal an ambulance.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.720
You're not fit to wear that uniform.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.223
You're rotten to the core.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.436
Beat me till your arms ache.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.815
I'll only come crawling back for more.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.735
You're forcing me to take measures...

18:32.945 --> 18:35.029
...to protect you from yourself.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.162
No, no!

18:43.413 --> 18:47.166
Put me down! Put me down!

18:54.633 --> 18:57.718
The moth and the flame,
that's what it was.

18:57.970 --> 19:02.598
Poor Miss Finch. I hope I didn't
singe her wings too badly.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.686
You read too many books
and see too many movies.

19:08.689 --> 19:14.026
For instance, take Elaine.
Your best friend, your bridesmaid.

19:14.278 --> 19:18.406
Let me tell you about that weekend
in Westport last summer.

19:18.657 --> 19:22.368
You were playing canasta,
suspecting nothing.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.872
Elaine and I went for a walk. Walk!

19:26.081 --> 19:30.084
We went swimming, moonlight swimming.

19:41.054 --> 19:46.309
What is this strange animal thing
you have? It bothers me.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.021
It's bothered me
since the first time I saw you.

19:50.272 --> 19:54.692
And it'll bother me always,
from here to eternity.

20:01.241 --> 20:06.037
You must fight it, Elaine.
Remember, I belong to another.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.496
Richard!

20:07.706 --> 20:13.044
This can never be. I have a devoted,
trusting wife at home.

20:13.295 --> 20:17.256
And a freckle-faced
little space cadet.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.967
Richard!

20:37.778 --> 20:41.405
So, Helen, in light
of the circumstances...

20:41.657 --> 20:44.867
...I resent your calling
to check up on me.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.911
Don't worry about me.

20:47.162 --> 20:51.415
Although I have tremendous
personal magnetism...

20:51.708 --> 20:54.418
...I also have strength of character.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.088
And tremendous imagination.

20:57.339 --> 21:02.760
You've begun to imagine it
Cinemascope, with stereophonic sound.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.722
Well...

21:08.016 --> 21:09.433
...back to work.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.396
Chapter three:

21:14.273 --> 21:20.152
"The Repressed Urge in the Middle-Aged
Male. Its Roots and Its Consequences."

21:22.990 --> 21:26.617
Helen is worried. I just know she is.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.537
She plays it cool,
but she can't fool me.

21:29.788 --> 21:33.749
Why else would she call
in the middle of the night?

21:34.001 --> 21:38.754
She probably figures she isn't
as young as she was. She's 31.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.842
One day she'll wake up
and find her looks are gone.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.136
No wonder she's worried.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.764
I don't look different
than I did when I was 28.

21:49.057 --> 21:53.060
It's not my fault, it's just
a simple biological fact.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.688
Women age quicker than men.

21:55.939 --> 22:01.027
I won't look different when I'm 60.
I have that kind of a face.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.530
Everybody'll think she's my mother.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.541
Hello, Mother?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.960
Oh, Helen!

22:18.128 --> 22:22.465
I wasn't expecting you to call
till 10. Everything all right?

22:22.758 --> 22:27.428
Everything's fine here. Seems pretty
empty without you, though.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.598
Just sitting out on the terrace...

22:30.766 --> 22:34.727
...drinking, getting fractured
on raspberry soda.

22:36.104 --> 22:39.607
Little Ricky okay? Oh, he did?

22:39.900 --> 22:43.611
He hasn't done that for a long time.
It's the excitement.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.781
That's nice.

22:49.743 --> 22:53.621
Who did you meet on the train?
Tom MacKenzie?

22:54.122 --> 22:56.123
What's he doing up there?

22:57.334 --> 23:00.461
My advice is to avoid Tom
like the plague.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.964
I don't want him
carrying Ricky's kayak.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.718
lf anybody carries Ricky's kayak,
it's gonna be you.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.804
How's the weather? Cool?

23:10.722 --> 23:14.683
It's steaming here, like an oven.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.978
Yeah, I'm pretty tired myself.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.232
Night. Good night, darling.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.990
Chapter three:

23:30.158 --> 23:33.160
"The Repressed Urge
in the Middle-Aged Male.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.206
Its Roots and its Consequences."

23:38.333 --> 23:42.920
Maybe a twist of lemon would help
this, or a shot of Worcestershire.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.731
Hey, what's the big idea?!
You wanna kill somebody?

24:03.358 --> 24:07.528
-What's the matter?
-This great cast-iron pot...

24:07.737 --> 24:09.780
...practically killed me.

24:10.031 --> 24:13.784
Oh, it's you. Well, hello again.

24:14.035 --> 24:17.371
What happened?
Oh, the tomato plant fell over!

24:17.706 --> 24:18.873
It sure did.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.917
-I'm terribly sorry.
-It's nothing.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.378
Look at that poor chair!

24:24.629 --> 24:28.549
I'll pay for it. I hope it's not
some priceless antique.

24:28.884 --> 24:33.929
-It's just early Sears, Roebuck.
-lf there's anything I can do....

24:34.222 --> 24:37.766
Do what? There's nothing
to worry about.

24:38.059 --> 24:42.313
I'm certainly glad you're not mad.
Now don't touch it.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.065
I'll have the janitor come down...

24:45.317 --> 24:48.235
...and take care of it. Good night.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.738
-Hey there! Wait a minute.
-Yes?

24:50.989 --> 24:53.782
I'll tell you one thing you could do.

24:54.075 --> 24:57.453
lf you're not doing anything else
more important.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.414
Would you have a drink with me?

25:00.790 --> 25:03.626
-Thanks, I'd love it.
-You would?

25:03.835 --> 25:05.169
Sure, it'd be fun.

25:05.420 --> 25:10.758
Let me just go and put something on.
I get dressed in the kitchen.

25:11.009 --> 25:15.930
When it's hot like this,
I keep my undies in the icebox.

25:17.015 --> 25:20.100
-In the icebox?
-See you in a minute.

25:22.812 --> 25:26.190
In the icebox!

26:00.684 --> 26:04.311
I really need it, Dr. Murphy.
Honest I do.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.985
Don't worry, Dr. Murphy.
Just one, that's all.

26:24.165 --> 26:28.210
All those lovely
injurious tars and resins.

26:28.503 --> 26:31.880
And now a small concession
from Dr. Summers?

26:44.227 --> 26:48.897
Doctor, let's be reasonable.
Can't fly on one wing.

26:49.190 --> 26:52.192
Okay, I'll put some soda in it.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.039
"Do you want to come in for a drink?"
"I'd love it."

27:05.248 --> 27:06.874
Just like that.

27:08.710 --> 27:13.756
A beautiful girl too.
Must be a model or actress.

27:33.109 --> 27:36.612
Atmosphere.
I need a little atmosphere.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.576
Tomato plant.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.579
Fan caught in the door.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.336
What am I doing?
This is absolutely ridiculous.

27:52.629 --> 27:56.965
The first night Helen leaves,
I'm bringing dames in here.

28:06.768 --> 28:07.768
Take it easy.

28:07.977 --> 28:13.440
There's nothing wrong with asking
a neighbor down for a drink.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.777
I hope she doesn't get the wrong idea.

28:16.945 --> 28:21.949
lf this dame thinks she's in for
a big time, she's in for a surprise.

28:22.158 --> 28:25.661
One drink and out!
I'm a happily married man.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.580
Maybe a little soft music.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.459
She's probably getting all fixed up.

28:32.794 --> 28:36.797
She'll probably wear
some ice-cold evening dress.

28:37.006 --> 28:42.344
Let's see. Debussy, Ravel.

28:42.637 --> 28:46.765
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky'd only scare her.

28:47.767 --> 28:51.770
Here's the baby, Rachmaninoff.
Give her the full treatment.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.273
Come in like gangbusters.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.157
Good old Rachmaninoff.

29:03.491 --> 29:07.661
The Second Piano Concerto.
Never misses.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.820
You came. I'm so glad.

29:45.575 --> 29:50.329
-Rachmaninoff.
-The Second Piano Concerto.

29:50.663 --> 29:54.500
-It isn't fair.
-Not fair? Why?

29:55.210 --> 29:58.921
-Every time I hear it, I go to pieces.
-Oh?

30:02.217 --> 30:04.510
May I sit next to you?

30:06.262 --> 30:08.055
Please do.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.122
It shakes me, it quakes me.

30:34.374 --> 30:37.084
It makes me goose-pimply all over.

30:37.293 --> 30:42.297
I don't know where I am,
or who I am, or what I'm doing.

30:42.590 --> 30:47.553
Don't stop, don't stop.
Don't ever stop.

30:49.222 --> 30:53.600
-Why did you stop?
-You know why I stopped.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.937
-Why?
-Because.

30:57.146 --> 31:00.566
Because now I'm going to kiss you...

31:00.775 --> 31:03.569
...very quickly and very hard.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.509
One moment, my dear.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.349
You came.

31:35.184 --> 31:37.978
Yeah, I came for the rugs.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.814
The rugs? What is it you want?

31:41.107 --> 31:43.942
The bedroom rugs.
I promised Mrs. Sherman.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.277
Mr. Kruhulik--

31:45.361 --> 31:48.947
-It's on account of the moths.
-Forget the rugs.

31:49.157 --> 31:53.619
Your wife is gonna find them
full of big, gaping holes.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.330
Who'll get blamed? The janitor.

31:56.539 --> 32:00.208
Pick them up tomorrow
while I'm at the office.

32:00.501 --> 32:05.547
I can't. I'm taking the missus
and the kids to the train.

32:05.840 --> 32:10.844
-They're going to the country.
-All right, in the afternoon then.

32:11.054 --> 32:16.475
I can't do it then. I'm going
to the barber in the afternoon.

32:16.684 --> 32:21.855
I'm gonna take a shave,
haircut, manicure, the whole works.

32:22.023 --> 32:26.526
I couldn't care less.
Come tomorrow evening, just not now.

32:26.736 --> 32:31.865
Tomorrow evening?
Do you know the maid from 531 Park?

32:32.075 --> 32:37.245
You must've seen her walking
down the street with her fat poodle.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.538
What?

32:38.706 --> 32:43.543
Come now, we're both summer bachelors.
Don't let's be naive.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.712
Good night, Mr. Kruhulik!

32:46.714 --> 32:50.384
Big, fat poodle! He's got four kids.

32:50.593 --> 32:55.222
Something happens to people
in the summer. It's disgraceful.

32:55.556 --> 33:00.394
It's late. Where is she?
This is ridiculous.

33:00.561 --> 33:04.898
She could've been here,
had her drink and gone home already.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.109
Ice, we'll need ice.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.407
Coming!

33:25.920 --> 33:27.379
Coming, coming!

33:32.635 --> 33:34.052
Hi!

33:34.554 --> 33:36.763
It's me. Don't you remember?

33:37.056 --> 33:39.099
The tomato from upstairs.

33:39.308 --> 33:42.602
Of course, the tomato.
Come in, please.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.480
Honestly, I don't know
how it happened.

33:45.773 --> 33:49.818
I was watering the plants.
I promised the Kaufmans I would.

33:50.111 --> 33:54.406
I was using the cocktail shaker.
It's the only thing I found.

33:54.615 --> 33:59.411
A little silver one.
Then there was this terrible crash.

33:59.662 --> 34:04.499
You could've been killed.
It's probably criminal negligence.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.961
You could've sued somebody.
Me, probably.

34:08.254 --> 34:12.841
Well, not you. You'd have been dead.
Your lawyers could have.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.469
Case dismissed.
What would you like to drink?

34:16.637 --> 34:21.349
I don't know. Anything.
You have a nice place here.

34:21.641 --> 34:25.978
-You live here alone?
-Yes, I live here alone. All alone.

34:28.190 --> 34:32.194
-It's a roller skate. Mine, you know.
-Yours?

34:32.487 --> 34:37.532
It's adjustable. I skate a lot.
What would you like to drink?

34:37.824 --> 34:41.119
-You do drink?
-Sure, I drink like a fish.

34:41.329 --> 34:45.456
-Do you have gin?
-Of course. You mean straight gin?

34:45.708 --> 34:49.335
No, gin and soda, I guess.

34:49.545 --> 34:54.549
-Gin and soda?
-That's wrong. How do you drink gin?

34:54.842 --> 34:59.971
There's gin and tonic, and gin
and vermouth, that's a martini.

35:00.181 --> 35:05.185
That sounds cool. I'll have a glass
of that. A big, tall one.

35:07.021 --> 35:09.523
Big, tall martini.

35:22.745 --> 35:26.164
This is a nicer apartment
than the Kaufmans'.

35:26.415 --> 35:29.376
For instance,
the Kaufmans have no stairs.

35:30.086 --> 35:33.839
-Hey, where do they lead to?
-No place.

35:34.048 --> 35:38.927
No place? A stairway to nowhere.
That's elegant.

35:39.220 --> 35:43.890
I wouldn't say elegant.
You see, this used to be a duplex.

35:44.183 --> 35:49.521
The landlord made two apartments
out of it by boarding up your floor.

35:50.356 --> 35:54.025
Oh, yes, I remember that patch
in the floor.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.070
I dropped my cuticle pusher
down the crack.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.573
Cuticle pusher. Yeah.

35:59.866 --> 36:03.743
Well, here you are. Big, tall martini.

36:04.036 --> 36:07.247
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.751
Very good.
Maybe it needs a bit more sugar.

36:11.961 --> 36:15.755
I'd strongly advise against
putting sugar in a martini.

36:16.048 --> 36:19.217
-You would? Why?
-Well....

36:19.635 --> 36:23.263
Take my word for it.
No sugar in a martini.

36:23.472 --> 36:26.725
Back home they put sugar in martinis.

36:26.934 --> 36:31.104
-Back home? Where?
-Denver, Colorado.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.274
Hey, you've got air conditioning!

36:35.276 --> 36:38.320
-How does it work? Put it on.
-Sure!

36:38.654 --> 36:43.241
I got air conditioning in every room.
Don't the Kaufmans?

36:43.451 --> 36:48.955
No, it's just terrible up there.
That's why I bought the electric fan.

36:49.916 --> 36:54.669
This feels just elegant.
I'm just not made for the heat.

36:54.962 --> 36:58.632
It's my first summer in New York,
and it's killing me.

36:58.841 --> 37:02.636
Yesterday,
I tried to sleep in the bathtub.

37:02.845 --> 37:05.597
Just lying up to my neck
in cold water.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.349
Good idea.

37:07.642 --> 37:12.270
But the faucet kept dripping.
It was keeping me awake.

37:12.521 --> 37:17.317
You know what I did?
I pushed my big toe up the faucet.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.153
They call that American know-how.

37:20.446 --> 37:24.449
Then my toe got stuck
and I couldn't get it out again.

37:24.659 --> 37:25.825
You couldn't?

37:26.118 --> 37:31.039
But there's a phone in the bathroom.
I was able to call the plumber.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.457
You called him?

37:32.667 --> 37:36.628
He was very nice,
even though it was Sunday.

37:36.837 --> 37:39.965
He rushed right over.

37:41.008 --> 37:42.550
Everything come out okay?

37:42.843 --> 37:47.681
-Sure. But it was embarrassing.
-I can see how it might've been.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.183
Honestly, I almost died.

37:50.393 --> 37:53.311
There I was with a strange plumber...

37:53.521 --> 37:56.189
...and no polish on my toenails.

38:03.072 --> 38:07.200
-You got a cigarette around?
-A cigarette? Sure.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.077
Coming up.

38:26.429 --> 38:30.223
-Here you are.
-Are you afraid of burglars?

38:30.433 --> 38:33.727
I'm just trying not to smoke.
The theory is:

38:34.061 --> 38:38.732
lf you don't see them,
you don't think about them.

38:40.735 --> 38:44.571
It's not 100% foolproof.
It's only a theory.

38:44.864 --> 38:49.784
All you do is spend half your life
dragging ladders back and forth.

38:50.077 --> 38:53.538
You could break a leg.
It's just ridiculous.

38:53.748 --> 38:57.250
At the club we had this girl
who only smoked cigars.

38:57.460 --> 39:01.254
She only did it
to make herself look older.

39:04.091 --> 39:07.594
-What club was that?
-This club I lived at.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.805
I hated it.
You had to be in by 1 a.m.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.767
Now I can stay out all night.

39:13.934 --> 39:18.438
I was glad when they
practically asked me to leave.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.108
-Why did they ask you to leave?
-It was so silly.

39:22.318 --> 39:27.572
I posed for a picture in
U.S. Camera and they got all upset.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.824
What was wrong with the picture?

39:30.117 --> 39:34.996
I was-- It was one of these
artistic pictures.

39:36.832 --> 39:39.125
On the beach, with driftwood.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.962
-It got honorable mention.
-In U.S. Camera?

39:43.130 --> 39:47.425
It was called "Textures."
You'd see three different kinds.

39:47.635 --> 39:51.679
The driftwood, the sand and me.
I got $25 an hour.

39:51.972 --> 39:56.518
-It took hours and hours.
-Very interesting line of work.

39:56.811 --> 40:01.981
I don't do modeling anymore.
Now I'm on TV every other week.

40:02.274 --> 40:05.318
-The Dazzledent Toothpaste Hour.
-You're an actress?

40:05.611 --> 40:08.154
Sort of. I do the commercial part.

40:08.364 --> 40:12.200
It's a good part.
They put gray makeup on my teeth...

40:12.493 --> 40:15.161
...to show ordinary toothpaste.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.998
Then they wipe it off
to show how Dazzledent works.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.836
I sit like this
for about 14 seconds...

40:23.045 --> 40:25.630
...and I get to speak lines too.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.676
"I had onions at lunch,
I had garlic dressing at dinner.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.721
But he'll never know.
I stay kissing-sweet...

40:34.014 --> 40:37.016
...the new Dazzledent way."

40:39.311 --> 40:42.147
-You do that beautifully.
-Thank you.

40:42.356 --> 40:46.317
People don't realize,
but when I show my teeth on TV...

40:46.527 --> 40:48.736
...I appear before more people...

40:48.988 --> 40:53.241
...than Sarah Bernhardt ever did.
Something to think about.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.535
It certainly is.

40:56.036 --> 41:00.540
Wish I were old enough to have
seen her. Was she magnificent?

41:02.877 --> 41:06.004
I wouldn't know.
I'm not that old myself.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.089
I guess you're not really.

41:08.382 --> 41:11.843
I'm 39. I will be in August.
At the moment I'm 38.

41:12.094 --> 41:15.763
Thirty-eight? I was 22,
day before yesterday.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.517
I didn't do anything about it.
I didn't tell anyone.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.520
I did buy a bottle of champagne.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.773
I thought I'd sit there,
drink it by myself.

41:26.066 --> 41:29.194
-That sounds absolutely sad.
-Oh, no!

41:29.403 --> 41:34.199
It would've been just elegant,
lying in a bath, drinking champagne.

41:34.408 --> 41:39.787
-But I couldn't get the bottle open.
-You couldn't? There's nothing to it.

41:40.289 --> 41:42.790
You think you could get it open?

41:43.042 --> 41:45.293
I'm pretty sure I could.

41:45.544 --> 41:48.463
I've got an idea.
I'll go up and get it.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.382
It's in the icebox with the potato
chips and my underwear.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.219
-Do you have champagne glasses?
-Yes.

41:54.428 --> 41:57.096
Good! We'll have a wonderful time.

41:57.306 --> 42:00.433
The man says it's very good champagne.

42:02.895 --> 42:08.107
-Shall I bring the potato chips too?
-Sure, let's shoot the works.

42:11.654 --> 42:15.490
Honorable mention in U.S. Camera.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.957
U.S. Camera.

42:30.589 --> 42:35.301
"News Events. Children and Animals.
The Human Body."

42:54.947 --> 42:58.783
Champagne glasses. Champagne glasses.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.851
Phone, phone. Where's the phone?

43:28.731 --> 43:31.024
Hello? Who is it?

43:31.317 --> 43:34.569
Oh, Helen. Well, this is a surprise!

43:34.862 --> 43:38.364
And a pleasant one. How are you?

43:38.657 --> 43:42.160
Sure, I'm all right.
Why shouldn't I be all right?

43:42.369 --> 43:46.497
In what way do I sound funny?
Everything is just fine.

43:46.707 --> 43:50.835
What's your problem?
Did I know Ricky forgot his paddle?

43:51.086 --> 43:55.381
I've been dragging that thing
all over New York. Sure, I will.

43:55.674 --> 43:59.385
I'll send it off first thing.
Good night.

43:59.678 --> 44:04.182
Who? Who dropped in after dinner?
Tom MacKenzie?

44:04.433 --> 44:07.185
Good old Tom. How is he?

44:07.603 --> 44:12.231
Drinking? Who, me?
Whatever gave you that idea?

44:12.524 --> 44:16.569
I was sitting here reading
a book about driftwood.

44:16.862 --> 44:21.449
We may publish it. It's interesting.
Some of the formations are--

44:23.369 --> 44:27.747
I'd better hang up.
The bathtub is running over.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.750
Good night. Night!

44:34.380 --> 44:39.717
Sorry, I was on the phone.
A friend of mine in the country--

44:39.927 --> 44:42.762
Oh, say!

44:43.097 --> 44:45.765
It isn't right to drink champagne
in pants.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.643
Would you mind fastening my straps?

44:48.977 --> 44:52.230
Oh, sure. Sure.

44:53.232 --> 44:58.277
Potato chips, champagne.
You really think you can get it open?

44:58.821 --> 45:04.117
Oh, yeah. I've opened one or two
before in my life.

45:04.284 --> 45:08.454
It's simply a matter of pressure
and counter-pressure.

45:08.747 --> 45:12.166
-There she goes.
-You've sure got powerful thumbs.

45:12.459 --> 45:16.462
I used to play a lot of badminton.
Get the glasses.

45:17.631 --> 45:19.298
Quick, quick! The glasses!

45:22.261 --> 45:24.762
-Pour it.
-Seems to be stuck.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.682
That's silly. Give it a good yank.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.352
This never happened before.

45:31.645 --> 45:35.273
It must be the vacuum.
The bubbles create a vacuum.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.483
Let me see if I can do it.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.280
I'll try to twist it.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.619
-You're married!
-I am? Yes, I am.

45:48.829 --> 45:52.665
I knew it. I could tell.
You look married.

45:54.543 --> 45:57.962
Actually, my wife and I are separated.

45:58.338 --> 46:02.216
Separated in the sense
that she went away for the summer.

46:02.509 --> 46:06.846
-Any children?
-No. Well, just one very little one.

46:07.139 --> 46:09.640
It's cold in there.
Finger's getting numb.

46:09.850 --> 46:12.852
I could call the plumber.
He's very good at this.

46:13.145 --> 46:15.855
No, let's keep the plumber out of it.

46:16.064 --> 46:18.399
Grab hold of the piano.

46:19.193 --> 46:22.069
Careful, I had my appendix out
last year.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.868
-Are you all right?
-Fine.

46:31.205 --> 46:34.916
Do you wanna waste it
now that you know I'm married?

46:35.209 --> 46:39.879
I think it's wonderful
that you're married. Just elegant.

46:40.088 --> 46:41.672
-You do?
-Of course.

46:41.924 --> 46:47.261
I wouldn't be lying on the floor
with some man if he wasn't married.

46:47.513 --> 46:50.056
That's an interesting
line of reasoning.

46:50.349 --> 46:53.059
With a married man it's so simple.

46:53.352 --> 46:56.771
I mean, it can't possibly
ever get drastic.

47:02.945 --> 47:08.407
-Have a potato chip.
-In what sense can't it get drastic?

47:08.617 --> 47:13.079
-People keep falling in love with me.
-I can believe it.

47:13.372 --> 47:18.376
-They get this strange idea.
-I believe that too.

47:18.627 --> 47:20.628
They ask me to marry them.

47:20.879 --> 47:24.257
All the time.
I don't know why they do it.

47:24.550 --> 47:28.636
-Maybe it's a kind of nervousness.
-Maybe.

47:28.929 --> 47:32.306
I don't wanna get married.
Not yet, anyway.

47:33.267 --> 47:36.602
That'd be worse than living
at the club.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.938
I'd have to get in by 1 again.

47:39.273 --> 47:42.400
Very true, you would.
At least occasionally.

47:42.609 --> 47:45.736
That's what's wonderful
about a married man.

47:45.988 --> 47:49.115
No matter what,
he can't ask you to marry him.

47:49.324 --> 47:52.618
-He's married already. Right?
-Right.

47:56.415 --> 48:01.961
You certainly don't have to worry
about me. Am I ever a married man!

48:02.254 --> 48:06.674
I'm the most married man
you'll ever know. And I promise...

48:06.925 --> 48:12.305
...I will never ask you to marry me,
come what may.

48:13.432 --> 48:16.350
-Well, how about some music?
-Fine.

48:16.643 --> 48:20.479
Let's see what we've got here.

48:20.772 --> 48:25.026
Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.153
Hey, how about this one?

48:27.446 --> 48:30.698
Rachmaninoff,
the Second Piano Concerto.

48:30.991 --> 48:34.660
You look to me
like a big Rachmaninoff girl.

48:34.870 --> 48:38.789
I do? Funny, I don't know
anything about music.

48:38.999 --> 48:44.170
You don't have to.
Just listen to it, that's all.

48:53.055 --> 48:58.184
This is classical music, isn't it?
I can tell. There's no vocal.

49:01.813 --> 49:03.314
Don't talk.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.025
Don't fight it.

49:06.193 --> 49:09.528
Relax. Go limp.

49:10.405 --> 49:13.157
-Like this?
-Yes.

49:13.367 --> 49:16.035
Let it sweep over you.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.757
I got the biggest thing
for Eddie Fisher.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.848
Frequently, people go to pieces
listening to this.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.518
-No kidding?
-Yes.

49:40.936 --> 49:45.064
It quakes them. It shakes them.

49:45.357 --> 49:49.402
Makes them goose-pimply all over.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.738
Did you ever dunk a potato chip
in champagne?

49:52.948 --> 49:57.410
It's real crazy. Here.

49:57.703 --> 50:02.289
-Isn't that crazy?
-Yeah, pretty crazy.

50:02.541 --> 50:07.586
We'd better send Rachmaninoff off.
This wasn't such a good idea.

50:07.879 --> 50:10.923
Don't worry, everything's fine.

50:11.216 --> 50:14.051
A married man, air conditioning...

50:14.261 --> 50:18.889
...champagne and potato chips.
It's a wonderful party.

50:19.099 --> 50:23.310
Hey! Look, you've got U.S. Camera!

50:23.603 --> 50:26.731
I do? How about that!

50:27.274 --> 50:28.983
I've got U.S. Camera.

50:29.276 --> 50:34.613
I bought a dozen copies of this
but people kept stealing them.

50:34.823 --> 50:36.949
Why would they do that?

50:37.784 --> 50:40.745
That's me, right there on the beach.

50:41.455 --> 50:45.249
My hair was a little longer then.
Did you notice?

50:45.459 --> 50:49.170
No, I didn't.
Let me ask you something.

50:49.463 --> 50:53.424
When they took this,
there must've been some passersby.

50:53.633 --> 50:57.470
Other people around.
How did they keep the crowd back?

50:57.637 --> 51:01.807
It was taken early in the morning.
Nobody was up.

51:01.975 --> 51:06.979
-Except-- You see that shadow?
-Is it a sea gull?

51:07.272 --> 51:11.442
No, a coast guard helicopter.
He kept buzzing the beach.

51:11.651 --> 51:15.321
Maybe you'd like me to autograph
this before I leave.

51:15.614 --> 51:18.157
You're not leaving yet,
are you?

51:18.450 --> 51:21.619
-How about more champagne?
-Love some.

51:24.206 --> 51:26.165
Just freshen it.

51:28.877 --> 51:30.795
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

51:31.004 --> 51:32.463
Here.

51:35.717 --> 51:39.345
We should have some music.
Do you play the piano?

51:39.638 --> 51:44.350
Not really. Not anymore. I used to.
Just a little as a child.

51:44.518 --> 51:48.687
-Go ahead, play something.
-Well, all right.

51:52.317 --> 51:56.320
Let's see if I remember this.
It's a little tricky.

52:16.383 --> 52:20.553
"Chopsticks"! I can play that too.
Shove over.

52:42.868 --> 52:47.621
I don't know about that Rachmaninoff,
but this really gets me.

52:47.914 --> 52:50.249
-It does?
-And how.

52:59.259 --> 53:03.387
-I can feel the goose pimples.
-Goose pimples?

53:08.602 --> 53:12.479
Don't stop.

53:13.732 --> 53:17.151
-Why do you stop?
-You know why.

53:17.402 --> 53:22.656
Because now I'm going to take you
in my arms and kiss you...

53:22.949 --> 53:25.743
...very quickly and very hard.

53:25.952 --> 53:27.953
Hey, wait a minute!

53:33.960 --> 53:38.172
-What happened? I lost track.
-I don't know.

53:38.465 --> 53:41.634
This is terrible.
There's nothing I can say.

53:41.927 --> 53:45.137
Except that I'm terribly sorry.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.973
Nothing like this ever happened
to me before.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.685
This happens to me all the time.

53:52.145 --> 53:53.604
This is unforgivable.

53:53.813 --> 53:58.025
The only possible excuse is
that I'm not quite myself tonight.

53:58.318 --> 54:01.862
Maybe it'd be better
if you would just go.

54:02.155 --> 54:07.493
-Why? You're being silly.
-Please go. I must insist.

54:10.288 --> 54:12.790
Take your potato chips and go.

54:14.960 --> 54:18.170
All right, if you really want me to.

54:22.342 --> 54:24.468
-Good night.
-Good night.

54:27.138 --> 54:29.306
I think you're very nice.

54:34.813 --> 54:39.024
Nice! You're not nice. You're crazy,
that's what you are.

54:39.317 --> 54:43.654
Helen's gone for one day
and you're running amuck.

54:43.863 --> 54:49.368
Smoking, drinking, picking up girls,
playing "Chopsticks."

54:51.329 --> 54:56.041
You're not gonna live through
this summer. Not like this.

55:01.047 --> 55:02.923
Look at those bloodshot eyes.

55:03.216 --> 55:06.844
Look at that face, ravaged,
dissipated, evil.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.514
One morning you'll look in the mirror
and that's all.

55:10.724 --> 55:13.225
The Portrait of Dorian Gray.

55:35.415 --> 55:39.752
-Good morning, Mr. Sherman.
-Good morning, Miss Morris.

55:41.338 --> 55:44.840
-Mr. Brady get in yet?
-Yes, he came in early.

55:45.091 --> 55:49.261
-I wanna see him. Put this on my desk.
-Of course.

55:49.429 --> 55:52.598
Would you like me to get
coffee and a doughnut?

55:52.891 --> 55:53.932
No, thank you.

55:54.184 --> 55:57.436
Have you had breakfast,
with the family away?

55:57.729 --> 56:00.856
I'm capable of fixing
my own breakfast.

56:01.107 --> 56:05.778
I had a peanut butter sandwich
and two whiskey sours.

56:11.117 --> 56:14.453
-Mr. Brady.
-Oh, Sherman, come in.

56:16.539 --> 56:17.790
Well, what is it?

56:18.083 --> 56:23.462
I've been with this company for years,
and I've never asked for a favor.

56:23.797 --> 56:27.466
-You had a raise in February.
-I'm not talking about that.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.802
This is more important than money.

56:30.095 --> 56:34.973
I want two weeks off to join
my wife and son in the country.

56:35.225 --> 56:39.895
This is our busy season.
We're preparing our fall list.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.814
I'm very tense and upset.

56:42.107 --> 56:46.944
I'm on the verge of a breakdown.
lf I could get back with my wife--

56:47.153 --> 56:50.155
-How long have you been married?
-Seven years.

56:50.448 --> 56:54.993
In a few years, you'll be delighted
to get rid of them for the summer.

56:55.245 --> 56:59.665
Shipped them to Nantucket
yesterday afternoon...

56:59.916 --> 57:02.626
...and I haven't been to bed since.

57:05.130 --> 57:10.342
Drank bourbon, smoked cigars,
played poker till this morning.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.846
Came to the office.
Never felt better in my life.

57:14.139 --> 57:20.185
I may not go to bed at all till
the family gets back in September.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.479
lf I stay in New York alone...

57:22.689 --> 57:26.608
...there's a chance I may not live
to see September.

57:26.860 --> 57:31.196
That's ridiculous, Sherman.
You're just a little lonely.

57:31.531 --> 57:35.826
What about us teaming up tonight,
seeing if we can get lucky?

57:36.035 --> 57:38.537
It doesn't have to be just poker.

57:38.872 --> 57:42.374
We'll cut loose
and have us a real hootenanny.

57:42.709 --> 57:47.880
It's very kind of you, but
I don't think-- No hootenannies.

57:48.173 --> 57:53.385
Suit yourself, but I've been
thinking about that fall list.

57:53.636 --> 57:57.473
What would you think
of a 25-cent reprint...

57:57.724 --> 58:01.894
-...of The Portrait of Dorian Gray?
-Dorian Gray?

58:02.145 --> 58:06.398
Look what we'll be giving them
for a quarter!

58:06.649 --> 58:10.527
Vice, lust and corruption.
The story of a young man:

58:10.737 --> 58:14.573
On the surface, clear-eyed
and healthy, just like you.

58:14.866 --> 58:17.659
But underneath, dry rot.

58:17.911 --> 58:23.207
The termites of sin and depravity,
gnawing at his soul.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.751
How does that strike you?

58:26.252 --> 58:29.546
No, no. No.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.174
Chapter six:

58:32.383 --> 58:36.595
"The Infidelity Pattern
in the Married Male...

58:36.888 --> 58:38.555
...or the 'seven-year itch.'

58:38.765 --> 58:43.435
A study of18,000 marriages
conducted by myself...

58:43.686 --> 58:47.773
...leads us to believe that
the 'urge curve' in the husband...

58:48.024 --> 58:51.026
...rises sharply during
the seventh year.

58:51.277 --> 58:54.446
This phenomenon is humorously...

58:54.781 --> 58:57.783
...referred to
as the seven-year itch.

58:58.243 --> 59:01.578
Far from humorous,
this unfortunate urge...

59:01.788 --> 59:06.291
...strikes 84.6%
of the married male population...

59:06.543 --> 59:11.380
...rising to an alarming 91.8%
during the summer months."

59:20.974 --> 59:22.808
Changed my mind.

59:32.569 --> 59:37.656
"Case history A: Gustaf Meyerheim,
the mad lover of Leipzig.

59:40.493 --> 59:45.163
An extreme, but not unusual
case of the seven-year itch...

59:45.331 --> 59:48.500
...occurred in Leipzig,
Germany in 1912.

59:48.668 --> 59:52.838
Gustaf Meyerheim, happily married
for seven years...

59:53.089 --> 59:56.008
...suddenly--" Seven years!

01:00:01.806 --> 01:00:06.476
-Dr. Brubaker to see Mr. Sherman.
-Doctor, you're early.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:10.689
Yes, my 3:00 patient
jumped out of the window.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.817
So I'm ahead of schedule.
Which door?

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.902
This one.

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:22.826
-Good afternoon, Mr. Sherman.
-Dr. Brubaker.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:26.204
I see you've been working on my book.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:29.708
It's a wonderful book.
Very important.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.252
-It has something for everyone.
-Yes.

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:37.215
You'll be happy to know
that we're giving it a big promotion.

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:41.678
You'll be seeing this
in every drugstore in America.

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:46.058
-"Of Sex and Violence"?
-We had to soup up the title.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.727
What does this represent?

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.731
Gustaf Meyerheim,
the mad lover of Leipzig...

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.401
...terrorizing one of his victims.
Isn't that sensational?

01:00:56.694 --> 01:01:01.448
May I remind you that Meyerheim
was small, with a red beard?

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.408
Nobody knows that.

01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:05.410
They know it in Leipzig.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.289
And all his victims
were middle-aged women.

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:12.959
Don't you think it'd be
more effective...

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:16.880
...to show a man terrorizing
a young girl, sales-wise?

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:21.593
I'm not a salesman. I'm a doctor.
I heal sick minds.

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:27.265
I find ways to root out insecurities,
neuroses, inner tensions....

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:32.270
-What is it? What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:39.444
-Does that mean something, doctor?
-No, nothing serious.

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:44.241
-Dark clouds on the psychic horizon.
-That's preposterous.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.953
A twitch in a thumb,
a nerve or a muscle.

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:53.417
You psychiatrists make a case
out of it. Of all the ridiculous....

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:56.336
-Are you very expensive?
-Very.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.339
-I'm sure you make exceptions.
-Never.

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:02.300
lf a case really interests you?

01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:05.470
At $50 an hour,
all my cases interest me.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:10.434
lf you run into something spectacular,
another Gustaf Meyerheim--

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:14.020
You wouldn't believe this,
but last night...

01:02:14.313 --> 01:02:19.484
...I found myself terrorizing
a young lady.

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:22.529
That could account for the thumb.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:27.367
Actually, it wasn't that bad.
I just made a little boo-boo.

01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:31.163
Psychoanalysis doesn't recognize
the boo-boo as such.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:33.707
Everything is unconscious.

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.001
I was completely conscious.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.713
I told her to take
her potato chips and go.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:43.967
-Potato chips. lf you please....
-All right, doctor.

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:50.307
I'm in serious trouble. I'm married.

01:02:50.975 --> 01:02:54.853
"Serious trouble. Married."
So far, normal.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.355
I've been married for seven years.

01:02:57.648 --> 01:03:01.693
I'm coming down with what you call
the seven-year itch.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:06.656
-What am I going to do?
-lf something itches, scratch.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:11.119
I scratched. There was this lady.
Everything went black.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.873
I terrorized her,
I attempted to terrorize her.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.542
The attempt was unsuccessful?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:22.964
Definitely. All I did was knock
us both off the piano bench.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:26.343
Let me understand.
You attempted to terrorize...

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:29.513
...a young lady on a piano bench?

01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:31.723
Yes.

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:36.520
And on whose person
was this attempt committed?

01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:40.690
Here, doctor. I brought this with me.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.444
I didn't wanna leave it
lying around the house.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.863
That's her.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.950
Her hair was a little longer then.

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:59.709
It's called "Textures" because
you can see three different textures.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.378
It got honorable mention.

01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:05.549
Splendid. I congratulate you
on your good taste.

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:08.885
Interesting driftwood formation too.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:13.265
I'll give you my advice.
Do not attempt it again.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.977
But if you should,
give yourself room to work in.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:21.106
Do not attempt it balanced
on a piano bench.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.108
Such an attempt is doomed.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:26.736
-I love my wife.
-Don't we all? Your time is up.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:32.158
lf you find yourself in need
of further analysis, phone my office.

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:37.122
As for my book, we'll resume
discussion as your...has subsided.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:42.669
lf she tells anybody about this,
I'll kill her with my bare hands.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.462
A possible solution.

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:48.925
But murder is the most difficult
crime to commit.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:52.304
Until you can commit
a simple act of terror...

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:57.309
...I strongly advise you
to avoid anything so complex.

01:04:57.643 --> 01:05:01.771
One must learn to walk
before one can run. Goodbye.

01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:10.947
I'm in big trouble.

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:14.868
Girls like this can't keep
their mouths shut.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.787
This'll be all over New York.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:22.667
I bet right this minute
she's telling someone about it.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:28.173
He lured me in his apartment.
He made me sit on his piano bench.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:32.344
He made me play "Chopsticks."
Then he turned on me.

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:35.180
He was frothing at the mouth...

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:40.060
...just like the creature from
the Black Lagoon!

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:43.521
I knew it. I knew it!

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:48.526
That's how these stories get started.
Big blabbermouth.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.529
Then he lured her
into his apartment...

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:56.743
...pretended he wasn't married.
He forced her onto the piano bench.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:06:01.665
I know him very well. He was in
here for dinner, 260 calories.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:05.043
He forced her to sit
on the piano bench...

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:09.005
...and then he
made her play "Chopsticks."

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:16.054
The word is spreading. It's spreading.
It's like jungle drums.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:20.392
Everybody knows about it.
Everybody's talking about it.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.230
Television!
I forgot she's on television.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:28.066
50 million TV sets in America.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:31.277
And now with the coaxial cable...!

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:36.741
I had onions at lunch.
I had garlic dressing at dinner.

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:38.994
But he'll never know...

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:45.291
...because I stay kissing-sweet
the new Dazzledent way.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:52.882
Now that I have your attention,
I want to warn all you girls...

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:56.553
...about an evil, dangerous,
married man...

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:59.097
...living downstairs in my building.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.434
His name is Richard Sherman.

01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:06.146
S-H-E-R-M-A-N.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:09.274
While his wife and son are in Maine...

01:07:09.483 --> 01:07:13.278
...this monster is terrorizing
the girls of New York.

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:17.157
Mommy, come quick!
They're talking about Daddy.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.577
He makes them sit
on the piano bench...

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.329
...and makes them play "Chopsticks."

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:26.499
Then suddenly he turns on them...

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:30.462
...just like the creature from
the Black Lagoon!

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:35.967
Well, I might as well face it.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:41.139
She knows everything.
She knows, she knows, she knows.

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:46.686
But maybe she doesn't.
Maybe there isn't any TV up in Maine.

01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:51.149
I can't go on like this.
Why don't I just call Helen?

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:56.196
The minute I heard her voice,
I could tell if she knew anything.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:58.656
All right, call her.

01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:06.623
Hello, long distance?
I want Ogunquit, Maine.

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:11.628
Ogunquit-42831 J. Yeah, thanks.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:18.009
What's taking so long? Maybe she's
talking to the lawyers already.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:23.389
Hello, hello? Helen? Bad connection.

01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:26.850
Who? Who is this?

01:08:27.144 --> 01:08:29.813
I wanna talk to Mrs. Sherman.

01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:34.859
Who is this? Oh, the babysitter.

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:39.238
Look, this is Mr. Sherman.
Where is Mrs. Sherman?

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:42.742
What do you mean she's on a hayride?

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:45.912
With whom is she on a hayride?

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:48.872
Mr. MacKenzie and some people?

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.751
What people?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:58.049
She did leave a message?
What was the message?

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:04.889
Ricky's paddle. No, I forgot.
Something came up.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.977
I'll send it first thing
in the morning. Goodbye!

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.313
-Mr. Sherman?
-What is it, Miss Morris?

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:15.817
It's after 6.
Do you need me anymore tonight?

01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:19.737
No. We've come to the end
of a perfect day.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:23.448
Let's go home and enjoy
the simple things.

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:28.746
The good things, the real things.
The laughter of a child.

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:33.001
A flight of swallows winging
their way back home.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.087
Life can be beautiful, Miss Morris.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.479
Hey!

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:55.815
Good evening.

01:09:56.775 --> 01:09:58.651
I just washed my hair.

01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:03.198
That's nice. Goodbye.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:12.123
Oh, no, not tonight.
This girl's a pistol.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:15.627
Got away with it once.
Why press my luck?

01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:24.969
It's gonna be quiet around here
tonight. I promise you that.

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:31.017
Take a shower, poach an egg,
rinse a shirt, hit the sack...

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.977
...and that's all.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:58.503
lf she was washing her hair
for me, is she kidding?

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:04.926
Helen, what a wife!
How lucky can you get?

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.553
I'm glad she's having a good time.

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:12.183
People to go out with,
take her on hayrides.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:19.023
One thing, though. What's she doing
on a hayride with MacKenzie?

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:22.694
I wish she wouldn't hang around
people like that.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.071
He's capable
of making a pass at her.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:28.700
She'll probably like it.
She's getting older.

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:33.121
I'm probably very dull.
And MacKenzie is a writer.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:37.625
A lousy writer.
That last book of his!

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:41.129
All that downwardly pulsating...

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.299
...and hair spilled across the pillow.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:49.470
No woman is safe around a guy
who writes stuff like that.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:08.406
No, Tom, please. The other people!

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:12.410
I have a confession to make.
Look around.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:19.292
-There are no other people.
-Don't be angry.

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:21.336
I should be.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:25.006
No, Tom. What about the driver?

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:29.260
-There is no driver.
-No driver?

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:33.598
I thought of everything.
Even the horses are wearing blinkers.

01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:38.478
-Tom, I'm afraid.
-Afraid? Of me?

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:41.773
No, of me.

01:12:42.941 --> 01:12:46.944
Oh, darling!
Downwardly, pulsating, striving.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:50.448
Now together, ending and unending.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:54.494
Now, now, now!

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:59.332
What a cornball. Okay, good luck.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:04.504
If that's the way you wanna play it,
I can play it that way too!

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.142
Kaufman. Kaufman. Kaufman.

01:13:31.865 --> 01:13:37.245
Hi! Did you know you left your
tomato plant down here last night?

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:41.666
I'd be glad to bring it up.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:46.671
Maybe you'd like to have dinner.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:52.260
Then maybe we could
go to an air-conditioned movie.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.737
Didn't you love the picture? I did.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:16.367
But I just felt so sorry
for the creature at the end.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:20.705
Sorry? What, did you want him
to marry the girl?

01:14:20.914 --> 01:14:25.460
He was scary-looking,
but he wasn't really all bad.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:28.463
He just craved a little affection.

01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:32.717
A sense of being loved
and needed and wanted.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.720
That's an interesting point of view.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.723
Do you feel the breeze
from the subway?

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:41.058
Isn't it delicious?

01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:51.235
Sort of cools the ankles.
What would be fun to do now?

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.447
-It's getting pretty late.
-Not that late.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:58.242
I have this big day tomorrow.
I have to get to sleep.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:14:59.660
What's the big day?

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:04.749
Tomorrow I'm on TV.
I told you, The Dazzledent Hour.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.960
Oh, here comes another one.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:17.929
Tell me, Dazzledent toothpaste,
I don't think I ever tried it.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:22.475
You should. It's excellent.
Oh, yes, I use it myself.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:26.437
-Then you do recommend it?
-Definitely.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:31.943
It costs a little more,
but 8 out of 10 oral hygienists--

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:36.113
You sound like a commercial.
lf I believed commercials....

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:40.034
-You can believe this one.
-What's that you say?

01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:45.456
"He'll never know. I stay kissing-
sweet the new Dazzledent way"?

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:50.294
-Now really.
-It's true! I'll prove it to you.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.299
Well?

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:59.303
My faith in the integrity
of advertising is restored.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:05.226
However, before I switch brands,
I wanna make absolutely certain.

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:14.318
A successful businessman
like Kaufman...

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.320
...probably makes 15,000 a year.

01:16:16.488 --> 01:16:21.659
Spends a fortune on sculptures
but will not put in air conditioning.

01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:25.246
I bet it was 95
in the bedroom last night.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.665
Poor kid, it's awful.

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:31.168
Good night.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.880
lf you wanted to drop by my place
to cool off...

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:38.509
...before you face that Turkish bath
up there....

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.431
I left the air conditioning
on full blast. It's cold in there.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:48.728
-Maybe for a few minutes.
-To bring the body temperature down.

01:16:49.521 --> 01:16:52.565
I feel no matter how much it costs...

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:56.068
...if you've got to sell
the kids' bonds...

01:16:56.361 --> 01:16:59.196
...I say in the summertime
in New York...

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:02.366
...you've got to have
air conditioning.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.369
Just feel that.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:15.463
I didn't tell you, but I have
air conditioning in every room.

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.758
The kitchen, the bathroom,
the bedroom.

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:22.053
-Heaven!
-You just relax.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:27.099
I'll fix two drinks,
and we'll have a nice, quiet talk.

01:17:38.945 --> 01:17:41.280
This is really the most!

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:45.910
Well, what shall we talk about?

01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:48.996
How about psychoanalysis?

01:17:49.414 --> 01:17:54.585
I don't know how much you know
about it, but it's a hobby of mine.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:59.090
I like to wander through the labyrinth
of the human mind.

01:17:59.299 --> 01:18:03.636
What gets me is spending $3.95
for that miserable fan.

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:05.805
It's absolutely useless.

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:09.684
I'll take it back to the store
to get my money back.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:13.437
Just hope I didn't
lose the sales slip.

01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:16.440
Two days ago we were strangers...

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:19.819
...and now you're here alone with me.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.280
How did it happen? Why did we meet?

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.617
The answer lies in the unconscious.

01:18:27.285 --> 01:18:32.123
lf they won't take back the fan,
the larger size is only $3 more.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:37.878
But what about tonight?
I've just got to get some sleep.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:43.384
You think that plant fell by itself
There are no accidents.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:46.512
Nothing happens by itself.
We make it happen.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:51.016
You didn't accidentally brush
the plant, you pushed it.

01:18:51.309 --> 01:18:56.355
Maybe if I took the fan,
put it in the icebox...

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.649
...and left the door open...

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:04.572
...then left the bedroom door open
and soaked the sheets in ice water....

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.533
No, that's too icky.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.161
Your behavior is obvious.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:13.330
You pushed the plant down to kill me.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.083
And why do you suppose you wanted to?

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:21.172
Could it be, could it possibly be
because you love me?

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.097
Of course I could simply ask him if--
I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:33.684
He's such a nice man.

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:39.231
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Under this veneer we're all savages.

01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:42.860
Man, woman, hopelessly enmeshed.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:47.406
We're on a toboggan, we can't stop.
It's too late to run.

01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:49.950
The beguine has begun.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.078
What are we going to do?

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:58.918
I've been thinking about it and l....

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:00.878
Yes?

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.298
I'd like to stay here
with you tonight.

01:20:05.091 --> 01:20:07.218
I'd like to sleep here.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:15.226
-Are you sure?
-That is, if you don't mind.

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:20.940
It's not a question of minding.
We don't wanna rush into this.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:25.903
There are savages, and savages.
This may be too savage.

01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:28.280
lf you want to stay--

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:31.909
Don't make me go
to that hot apartment.

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:37.289
I haven't slept in three nights.
I'd like to look good tomorrow.

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:40.835
I could sleep right here
in this chair.

01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:45.756
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
You won't know I'm around. Please?

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:53.264
Well, that's different.
Of course you can sleep here.

01:20:53.473 --> 01:20:56.600
We're not savages.
We're civilized people.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:21:01.105
-Thank you. What time do you get up?
-About 8, I guess.

01:21:01.314 --> 01:21:06.151
-I'll fix you breakfast.
-Fix my breakfast-- Wait a minute.

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:10.823
Suppose someone sees
you leaving the apartment at 8.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.617
Just one person sees you,
and we're dead.

01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:18.873
All right then, I could get up
at 6 and sneak upstairs.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:21.625
Get up at 6 and sneak-- Sneak!

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:25.963
Even worse. Suppose someone sees you
sneaking out?

01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:28.382
We're not doing anything wrong.

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:33.304
Certainly, but there's such
a thing as society, laws, rules.

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:36.682
But after all, no man is an island.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:47.568
-Who is it?
-It's me, Mr. Kruhulik.

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:04.919
-What is it?
-I was just coming home.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:09.506
Went out with a lady,
the one with the big, fat poodle.

01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:14.845
I saw your light. I thought it might
be a good time to pick up the rugs.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:18.223
At 1:30 in the morning?
Are you out of your mind?

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.351
I promised your wife.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:25.606
Those moths are probably right now
chewing away big, gaping holes.

01:22:25.857 --> 01:22:28.567
Stop worrying.
I give you my word...

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:31.362
...the moths are not eating anything.

01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:35.532
Come tomorrow, early,
before they have their breakfast.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:38.744
You can't trust a moth, Mr. Sherman.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.788
They get hungry at night...

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:44.875
...so they start looking around
for a snack and--

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:55.052
-Oh, I wish I was dead.
-What's the matter?

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:59.431
I'm sorry. I didn't quite
understand the situation.

01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:03.310
In a situation like this,
who cares about moths?

01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:06.563
Situation, Mr. Kruhulik?
What situation?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.654
Moths? Let them eat the rugs.

01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:16.782
Let them eat the curtains. Who cares?

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.910
Go, man, go.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:25.416
I'd like to explain this.
This may seem unusual.

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:29.420
-But it's the most natural thing.
-I'll say.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:34.842
"Summertime, and the living is easy.
Fish are jumping, cotton is high."

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:39.430
That's enough! The young lady
lives in this building.

01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:42.599
-There's been a terrible accident.
-Hi.

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:46.186
Well, hello!

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:50.816
Isn't she a living doll?

01:23:51.317 --> 01:23:54.194
This lady's tomato plant fell down.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:58.032
Sorry to disappoint,
but that's all there is to it.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.993
In fact, I'm glad you dropped in.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:05.497
You can help her take
the plant upstairs. It's here.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.709
I watered the garden
with a cocktail shaker.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.627
A little silver shaker.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:14.173
You can see your insinuations
are preposterous.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:17.384
A natural mistake, Mr. Sherman.

01:24:17.635 --> 01:24:22.473
And my apologies to you, dear lady.
What a doll!

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:26.560
-Right out here, Mr. Kruhulik.
-What a shambles.

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:31.065
It's all right.
We're covered. I have a policy.

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:36.195
Thank you, Mr. Kruhulik,
and good night.

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:40.074
Good night, Miss--
Whatever your name is.

01:24:40.366 --> 01:24:43.202
Be careful, it's heavy.
Don't strain anything.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.037
I'm strained already...

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:50.667
...from carrying that big,
fat poodle around. I wish I was dead!

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.672
-Well, good night.
-Good night.

01:24:56.841 --> 01:25:00.511
I'm sorry.
But you can see how it is.

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:04.181
I understand. No man is an island.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:14.858
Normal.

01:25:17.403 --> 01:25:20.114
Everything is absolutely normal.

01:25:20.406 --> 01:25:22.699
Sleep. Go to sleep.

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:25.244
How can I possibly sleep?

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.746
What'll I do?

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:34.461
Helen. Write to Helen.
Write a long letter to Helen.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.716
Paddle, that's it.
I've got to send the paddle.

01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:44.138
Little Ricky out there on the lake
without a paddle.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:48.976
Wrap the paddle and send it off
in the morning. Ricky needs it.

01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:54.606
Going to get his paddle.
How do you wrap a paddle, anyway?

01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:57.401
Paper and string, what else?

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:01.947
I need a piece of paper the shape
of a paddle.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:14.251
All right, nothing.

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:20.132
Hey, there's some gauze
in the bathroom.

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:24.344
I can bandage the whole thing,
put some tape on it and--

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:28.265
And what, send it up in an ambulance?

01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:33.103
This is ridiculous.

01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:37.274
People send paddles every day.
The mails are full of them.

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.693
How do they do it?

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:45.490
That's it, old newspapers!

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.285
Big deal, old newspapers.

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:52.289
Get a lot of string,
slap it together....

01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:12.476
Hi.

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:20.984
Forgot about the stairs. It was
so easy. I pulled out the nails.

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:26.865
You know what?
We can do this all summer.

01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:20.544
Miss. Young lady.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:25.549
I've got to take a shower.
Got to get to the office.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.887
Please, lady, get up, go home
so I can get to the office.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.433
Please, lady? No?

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:30.489
Poor kid, working in New York
in this heat.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:35.452
And on television! Standing there
under those hot lights.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.541
She must need money real bad.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:46.838
Lives in an expensive apartment.
I know what clothes cost.

01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:49.716
Buys imported champagne.

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:53.136
How can she possibly afford--?

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:55.806
She must have
other sources of income.

01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:01.728
Plenty of ways a girl can get money
if she's unscrupulous enough.

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:07.192
She could get herself some foolish,
well-to-do married man.

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.986
Trap him into some situation.

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:15.158
Bleed him till he's white,
squeeze him till he's dry--

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:21.832
They have a word for this.
They call it "blackmail."

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:35.762
Where is she? She's with Kruhulik.

01:30:36.013 --> 01:30:40.183
They're down at the bank
going through my safe-deposit box.

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:49.943
Hello, are you in there?

01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:55.198
Hi, good morning! Just taking
a shower. Be out in a minute.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:04.458
Taking a shower, she'll be out
in a minute, that's all.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:09.129
I should get one of the new towels
and take it to her.

01:31:11.382 --> 01:31:15.218
That would very definitely
be another boo-boo.

01:31:17.388 --> 01:31:21.892
lf anyone were to walk in,
would they ever get the wrong idea.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:27.397
Cinnamon toast for two, strange blond
in the shower. Explain that.

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:31.443
Tell them you spent the night
wrapping a paddle.

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.073
Anybody walk in here!

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:42.496
Who's gonna walk in here?
J. Edgar Hoover? Arthur Godfrey?

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.498
Helen, maybe?

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:54.758
She's in Maine.
How could she get here?

01:31:56.761 --> 01:32:01.681
On the train, that's how.
On the early morning train.

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:06.561
Why would she be coming to New York?
Because she knows something.

01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:10.690
Because someone tipped her off.
Who could've tipped--?

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:13.985
Kruhulik!
He saw the girl here last night...

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:18.490
...called Helen long distance
and told her everything.

01:32:18.741 --> 01:32:23.870
She's on the train, I know it.
Early morning train's in already.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.167
She's in a cab. She's on her way here.
She'll be here any second!

01:32:37.426 --> 01:32:41.096
There's a woman in this apartment.
I know there is.

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:45.892
-No, Helen, it's not true.
-Don't lie to me, Richard.

01:32:46.143 --> 01:32:49.479
Who told you? Was it Kruhulik?

01:32:49.772 --> 01:32:54.359
That's right.
I've had him watching you for months.

01:32:54.986 --> 01:33:00.407
His name's not Kruhulik. He's
a private eye named Johnny Dollar.

01:33:00.616 --> 01:33:04.035
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to shoot you.

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:08.164
I can explain everything.
The cinnamon toast, the shower.

01:33:08.457 --> 01:33:09.916
This girl's from Denver.

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:15.213
The Kaufmans have no air conditioning.
Spend a fortune on sculpture.

01:33:15.464 --> 01:33:19.926
The drugstore wouldn't
take back her fan, she lost the slip.

01:33:20.177 --> 01:33:25.473
So I let her sleep in our bed.
I was just wrapping the paddle.

01:33:26.475 --> 01:33:30.854
At least have the decency to keep
the paddle of a child...

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.814
...out of this sordid mess.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:37.694
You're mad.
You'll never get away with this.

01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:42.407
Yes, I will. There's such a thing
as the unwritten law.

01:33:42.658 --> 01:33:44.367
Goodbye, Richard.

01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:51.583
-Give me another chance!
-They'll give me a medal.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:55.211
The wives of America
will give me a medal!

01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:12.395
Helen, I'm going fast.
Give me a cigarette.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:18.026
A cigarette! You know what
Dr. Murphy told you about smoking.

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:23.365
A cigarette.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.745
Just one more cigarette, Dr. Murphy.

01:34:29.705 --> 01:34:31.956
One more for the road.

01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:34.626
For the long, long road.

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:38.129
Hi.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.468
-What are you doing?
-I need a cigarette.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:46.721
They're right there on the table.

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:51.685
-What's the matter with you?
-I'm all shot.

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:56.106
It's because I took your bed
and you slept on the couch.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:59.150
I knew I should've taken the couch.

01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:01.695
It's not the couch, it's my wife.

01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:05.657
-She found out about us and shot me.
-She what?

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:09.828
Five times in the back
and twice in the belly.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:12.789
You're just having a bad dream.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:16.501
Yeah, I guess so.

01:35:17.753 --> 01:35:21.172
Come on now. Everything's fine.

01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:26.761
It's just my imagination.
Some people have flat feet.

01:35:27.012 --> 01:35:31.891
-I have this appalling imagination.
-I think it's just elegant.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:37.188
I just have no imagination at all.
I have lots of other things.

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:41.317
I was standing in the kitchen.
Then it occurred to me.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:46.614
lf my wife walked in with you in the
shower, she'd probably shoot me.

01:35:46.866 --> 01:35:49.617
Of course. lf I was married...

01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:55.290
...and came in on my husband making
toast for a blond, I'd shoot him.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:58.418
-You would?
-Bang, bang, bang!

01:35:58.669 --> 01:36:00.503
Right in the head.

01:36:01.505 --> 01:36:03.548
Come on now, relax.

01:36:03.799 --> 01:36:07.761
-You're just making this all up.
-That's right.

01:36:08.012 --> 01:36:12.307
I don't suppose if she had come in
she'd shoot me.

01:36:12.516 --> 01:36:16.186
She'd be mad, maybe throw an ashtray.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:19.814
-Just that?
-She probably wouldn't even do that.

01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:22.442
lf she found you in the shower...

01:36:22.693 --> 01:36:25.695
...she'd probably think
you were the plumber.

01:36:26.697 --> 01:36:30.950
-A blond plumber?
-Absolutely. She trusts me implicitly.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:34.496
-Doesn't she love you?
-Oh, she loves me.

01:36:34.747 --> 01:36:36.247
She worries about me.

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:40.585
I had a cough,
and she made me stop smoking.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:43.713
-She loves me, all right.
-Isn't she jealous?

01:36:43.923 --> 01:36:50.220
Not really. How can anybody be jealous
of somebody with a briefcase...

01:36:50.429 --> 01:36:55.266
...who's getting a little pot
and can't keep his eyes open past 9?

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:58.853
She trusts me.
It'd never occur to her that I --

01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:03.149
Last Christmas, I came home
with lipstick on my collar.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.987
Helen said, "What's that
on your collar, cranberry sauce?"

01:37:09.406 --> 01:37:14.160
-That's bad.
-You know who kissed me? Mrs. Brady.

01:37:14.411 --> 01:37:18.623
Face it, no pretty girl wants me,
she wants Gregory Peck.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:22.710
Is that so? How do you know
what a pretty girl wants?

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:25.088
I don't know, but I imagine--

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:29.175
Your imagination!
You think every girl's a dope.

01:37:29.426 --> 01:37:33.638
You think a girl goes to a party
and there's some guy...

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:37.559
...in a fancy striped vest
strutting around...

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:42.438
...giving you that I'm-so-handsome-
you-can't-resist-me look.

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:46.109
From this she's supposed
to fall flat on her face.

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.237
Well, she doesn't fall on her face.

01:37:50.447 --> 01:37:54.701
But there's another guy in the room,
over in the corner.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:58.663
Maybe he's nervous and shy
and perspiring a little.

01:37:58.914 --> 01:38:00.957
First, you look past him.

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:05.962
But then you sense that
he's gentle and kind and worried.

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:11.050
That he'll be tender with you,
nice and sweet.

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:14.304
That's what's really exciting.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.811
lf I were your wife,
I'd be very jealous of you.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:25.565
I'd be very, very jealous.

01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:34.115
I think you're just elegant.

01:38:36.285 --> 01:38:37.827
Thank you.

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:40.997
Aren't you going to answer it?

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:44.083
-Answer what?
-The doorbell.

01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:48.463
Go ahead, I'll put the cinnamon
on the toast.

01:39:01.852 --> 01:39:04.395
Tom MacKenzie!

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:07.774
-Morning, Dickie-boy.
-What are you doing here?

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:11.986
-Don't call me "Dickie-boy."
-Got a date with my agent.

01:39:12.237 --> 01:39:14.489
-Is that coffee I smell?
-No.

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:19.786
I'm glad I caught you. We've got
important family business to discuss.

01:39:20.037 --> 01:39:23.831
-Are you sure that's not coffee?
-Positive. My family?

01:39:24.083 --> 01:39:28.628
I was driving down and Helen
asked me to stop by and ask you--

01:39:28.879 --> 01:39:32.006
She did? I'm glad she did...

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.550
...because I wanna talk to you.

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:37.762
What's the matter, Dickie-boy?

01:39:37.972 --> 01:39:42.558
You think you're pretty fancy
with the blinkers on the horses.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:45.228
What blinkers? What horses?

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:48.815
And no driver and no other people.

01:39:49.108 --> 01:39:52.402
-You drunk or something?
-No, I'm not drunk.

01:39:52.611 --> 01:39:57.156
-You took Helen on a hayride.
-No, in fact, I didn't.

01:39:57.408 --> 01:40:01.285
She went with the other people.
And it was like a bus.

01:40:01.537 --> 01:40:05.164
-That's your story.
-I have terrible hay fever.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:08.084
I've had it ever since the Army.

01:40:08.293 --> 01:40:13.089
This doctor took a wad of cotton.
He went in and down--

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:17.885
In and down. "Inwardly,
downwardly pulsating!

01:40:18.137 --> 01:40:23.433
Now together, ending and unending!
Now, now!" I know all about it.

01:40:23.726 --> 01:40:25.351
-You're drunk.
-Get out!

01:40:25.602 --> 01:40:28.896
-lf Helen sent you to get a divorce--
-Divorce?

01:40:29.148 --> 01:40:31.482
I absolutely refuse!

01:40:31.775 --> 01:40:35.987
-She sent me for the paddle.
-I'll fight it in every court!

01:40:36.238 --> 01:40:40.283
I can explain the stairs,
the blond in the kitchen.

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:45.705
-Wait, what blond in the kitchen?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

01:40:45.914 --> 01:40:48.166
Maybe it's Marilyn Monroe!

01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:52.378
Blind, stinking drunk
at 8:30 in the morning!

01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:57.175
I'll get six lawyers,
I'll bribe judges, but no divorce!

01:40:57.384 --> 01:41:01.054
Listen to me.
Helen does not want a divorce!

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:05.058
All she wants is Ricky's paddle!

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:10.271
-Ricky's paddle?
-The other kids are out on the lake.

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:15.485
But Ricky has to stay on the dock.
You wouldn't send his paddle!

01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:20.281
If anybody is gonna take
Ricky's paddle back...

01:41:20.532 --> 01:41:22.325
...I'm gonna take it back.

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:25.578
And I've got a good mind
to punch you.

01:41:25.829 --> 01:41:28.998
-Why?
-Because you're a big lunk.

01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:33.795
Strutting around in your vest
with that I'm-so-handsome look.

01:41:34.046 --> 01:41:38.549
-Let me tell you, Helen loves me.
-Sure, she loves you!

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:43.304
She loves me because I'm sweet
and gentle and worried...

01:41:43.555 --> 01:41:46.724
...and nervous and shy and tender!

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.443
Breakfast is ready.

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:03.116
-Anybody you know?
-Meet Tom MacKenzie.

01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:06.702
-How do you do?
-He came for Ricky's paddle.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:11.499
-I'm taking it to him.
-Is this a good time to pick up the--?

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:15.253
-I wish I was dead.
-Wait a minute, Kruhulik.

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:19.048
If you wanna pick up something,
pick up this.

01:42:19.341 --> 01:42:22.135
What do you want me to do with him?

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:27.265
I don't care. Put him in mothballs.
Just get him out of here.

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:30.893
Boy, I'm telling you,
lug the fat poodle...

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:34.313
...lug the tomato plant, now lug this.

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:39.152
I'll be glad when the wives get home
and things settle down.

01:42:40.362 --> 01:42:43.948
The 8:47, I can still make the 8:47.

01:42:44.199 --> 01:42:46.659
I can't stay for breakfast, I'm sorry.

01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:48.870
Don't ever be sorry.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.873
Do me a favor. Call Brady & Company.

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:57.753
Tell Mr. Brady I'm taking two weeks
off, whether he likes it or not.

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:02.717
Why don't you stay here?
You've got your own duplex.

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:06.137
Big, tall martinis, air conditioning.

01:43:06.388 --> 01:43:10.641
-Thank you.
-Well, I guess that's all.

01:43:11.268 --> 01:43:13.311
-Just one more thing.
-What?

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.355
I have a message for your wife.

01:43:24.573 --> 01:43:26.365
Don't wipe it off.

01:43:26.575 --> 01:43:28.784
lf she thinks it's cranberries...

01:43:28.994 --> 01:43:32.580
...tell her she's got cherry pits
in her head.

01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:35.833
Wait!

01:43:42.716 --> 01:43:44.175
Hey!
