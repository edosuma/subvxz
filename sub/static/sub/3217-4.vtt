00:02.127 --> 00:04.795
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off, saving people...

00:05.005 --> 00:07.256
...hunting things, the family business.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.635
Today's your lucky day, kid.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.764
- You watch out for Sammy, okay?
- Dad, you know I will.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.474
Dad?

00:18.476 --> 00:20.602
Time of death, 10:41 a.m.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.856
I miss him, man. And I'm not all right.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.775
- Neither are you.
- I'm dealing with Dad's death.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.487
Dad's dead.
It hurts so bad you can't take it.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.115
I'm okay.
The next person who asks me if I'm okay...

00:33.283 --> 00:35.701
...I'm gonna start throwing punches.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.209
Okay, we've got booze.

00:44.377 --> 00:48.630
We've got chocolate.
And-- Wait for it.

00:48.798 --> 00:52.509
-- tortured emo rock, a guaranteed cure
for any broken heart.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.970
You didn't have to do all this.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.514
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.145
Thanks, Neil.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.315
You're a good friend.

01:06.941 --> 01:07.983
Yeah.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.613
Oh, God, it's probably him.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.157
I'll take care of it.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.372
- Where is she?
- Chill out. Think about this for a second.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.917
- I need to talk to her.
- Some other time.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.711
You get out of my face, Neil.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.097
Angela?

01:55.198 --> 01:57.616
Leave me alone.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.243
Angela, I'm sorry.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.869
You're sorry?

02:02.455 --> 02:05.290
- You're sorry. Oh, that's great.
- Angela, listen to me.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.668
I don't wanna listen to you.
I'm done listening.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.794
- Listen to me.
- No...

02:10.003 --> 02:12.172
I loved you.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.819
Angela?

02:35.738 --> 02:37.447
Angela?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.922
Come on, Sam, I'm begging you.
This is stupid.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.675
- Why?
- Going to visit Mom's grave?

02:56.843 --> 03:00.095
She doesn't have a grave.
There was no body left after the fire.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.390
- She has a headstone.
- Yeah, put up by a man we've never met.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.102
So you wanna go pay your respects
to a slab of granite put up by a stranger?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.646
- That's not the point.
- Well, then, enlighten me.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.566
It's not about a body or a casket.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.818
It's about her memory, okay?

03:15.069 --> 03:18.280
And after Dad,
it just feels like the right thing to do.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.992
- It's irrational, is what it is.
- Look, man, no one asked you to come.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.246
Why don't we swing by the Roadhouse?
We haven't heard anything on the demon.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.207
We should be hunting that son of a bitch.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.585
That's a good idea. You should.
Just drop me off. I'll hitch a ride...

03:31.753 --> 03:34.671
- ...and I'll meet you there tomorrow.
- Right.

03:35.965 --> 03:40.886
I'd be stuck with those people, making
awkward small talk until you show up.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.804
No, thanks.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.379
I think, um...

04:17.632 --> 04:20.050
I think Dad would have wanted you
to have these.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.148
I love you, Mom.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.106
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.192
Angela Mason.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.112
She was a student at the local college.
Funeral was three days ago.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.615
And?

06:06.783 --> 06:10.118
You saw her grave. Everything dead
around it in a perfect circle.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.997
- You don't think that's a little weird?
- Maybe the groundskeeper went aggro...

06:14.165 --> 06:15.957
- ...with the pesticide.
- No, I asked him.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.127
No pesticide, no chemicals.
Nobody can explain it.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.463
Okay. So, what are you thinking?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.840
I don't know. Unholy ground, maybe.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.300
Un--?

06:25.468 --> 06:26.676
What?

06:26.886 --> 06:30.013
If something evil happened,
it could easily poison the ground.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.224
Remember the farm
outside of Cedar Rapids?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.768
- Yeah.
- Could be the sign of a demonic presence.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.523
Or the Angela girl's spirit,
if it's powerful enough.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.735
Don't get too excited,
you might pull something.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.655
It's just, stumbling onto a hunt?

06:46.823 --> 06:49.908
- Here, of all places?
- So?

06:50.159 --> 06:52.994
Are you sure this is about a hunt?
Not about something else?

06:53.162 --> 06:55.038
What else would it be about?

06:57.417 --> 07:00.585
- You know, just forget it.
- You can believe what you want, Sam.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.339
But I let you drag my ass out here.
Least we can do is check this out.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.009
Yep. Fine.

07:08.344 --> 07:11.513
Girl's dad works in town.
He's a professor at the school.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.399
Hey.
Hi. Good to see you.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.947
- Dr. Mason?
- Yes.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.199
I'm Sam. This is Dean.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.618
We were friends of Angela's. We...

07:34.537 --> 07:36.246
We wanted to offer our condolences.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.707
Please, come in.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.887
- She was beautiful.
- Yes, she was.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.557
This is an unusual book.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.646
Oh, it's Ancient Greek. I teach a course.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.574
So a car accident, that's...
That's horrible.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.078
Angie was only a mile away
from home when, uh...

08:18.289 --> 08:19.915
It's gotta be hard...

08:20.124 --> 08:22.250
...losing someone like that.

08:23.252 --> 08:27.380
Sometimes it's like
they're still around...

08:27.757 --> 08:31.092
...almost like
you can still sense their presence.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.179
- You ever feel anything like that?
- I do, as a matter of fact.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.101
That's perfectly normal, Dr. Mason.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.897
Especially with what
you're going through.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.942
You know, I still phone her.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.279
And the phone's ringing
before I remember that, uh...

08:55.201 --> 08:57.118
Family's everything, you know?

08:57.912 --> 09:00.956
Angie was the most important thing
in my life.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.543
And now, well, I'm just lost without her.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.551
We're very sorry.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.139
There's something going on.
We just haven't found it yet.

09:18.307 --> 09:22.310
Dean, so far you got a patch
of dead grass and nothing.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.980
Something turned that grave
into unholy ground.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.148
There's no reason
for it to be unholy ground.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.651
Angela Mason was a nice girl
who died in a car crash.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.363
That's not exactly vengeful-spirit material.
You heard her father.

09:33.531 --> 09:37.200
Maybe Daddy doesn't know everything
there is to know about his little angel.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.745
You know what? We never
should've bothered that poor man.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.165
- We shouldn't even be here anymore.
- So, what, Sam? We just bail?

09:44.333 --> 09:47.002
Without even figuring out
what's going on?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.671
I think I know what's going on here.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.340
It's the only reason
I went along with you this far.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.343
- What are you talking about?
- This is about Mom's grave.

09:57.513 --> 10:01.391
- It's got nothing to do with it.
- You wouldn't step within 100 yards of it.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.186
Look, maybe you're imagining a hunt
where there isn't one...

10:05.354 --> 10:08.189
...so you don't have to think
about Mom or Dad.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.035
You wanna take another swing?

10:20.202 --> 10:23.622
Go ahead, if it'll make you feel better.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.791
I don't need this crap.

10:31.547 --> 10:35.634
- Dean, where are you going?
- I'm gonna go get a drink. Alone.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.396
Seriously, get that camera out of my face.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.650
What, you shy?
I am, as a matter of fact.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.735
Then maybe this'll help you overcome it.

10:53.903 --> 10:54.903
I hate you.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.822
Oh, liar. You're crazy about me
and you know it.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.282
Shut up.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.286
You know, I just had an idea. We can
make a whole different kind of video.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.046
You jerk.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.968
Yeah, but I'm your jerk.
- Please turn the camera off.

11:25.142 --> 11:28.937
You're beautiful, you know that?
You know that, right?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.543
- Who the hell are you?
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.546
- Hold on.
- I'm calling 911!

12:36.756 --> 12:39.132
- I'm Angela's cousin.
- What?

12:39.341 --> 12:42.385
Yeah, her dad sent me over
to, uh, pick up her stuff.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.097
My name's Allan. Allan Stanwick.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.061
Her dad didn't say
that you were coming.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.606
Well, I mean...

12:56.609 --> 12:58.943
...how else would I have the key
to your place?

13:08.245 --> 13:14.501
So I'm sure you got a view of Angela
that none of the family got to see.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.461
Tell me, what was she like?

13:16.670 --> 13:19.506
- What was she really like?
- She was great.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.635
Just great.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.762
I mean, she was so...

13:29.016 --> 13:32.143
- Great.
- Yeah.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.063
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.274
There you go.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.152
You two must've been
really close, huh?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.781
We were.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.742
But it's not just her. It's Matt.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.079
- Who?
- Angela's boyfriend.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.331
Right, Matt.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.627
- Um, what about him?
- He killed himself last night.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.255
He cut his own throat.
Who does that?

14:01.674 --> 14:04.092
That's terrible.

14:04.468 --> 14:08.596
He was taking Angela's death
pretty hard, and I guess...

14:10.474 --> 14:14.561
- He'd been messed up about it for days.
- Messed up how?

14:14.770 --> 14:17.438
He kept saying
that he saw her everywhere.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.942
Well, I'm sure that that's normal. I mean,
with everything that he was going through.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.611
He said that he saw her.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.114
As in an acid trip or something.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.702
Were Angela and Matt a happy couple?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.371
Was there any reason
Angela would be angry with him?

14:33.581 --> 14:35.331
What?

14:35.499 --> 14:37.834
No, of course not. Why do you ask?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.336
Just asking.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.008
Where did Matt live?

14:45.175 --> 14:46.926
Next on the Skin Channel:

14:47.094 --> 14:52.015
Casa Erotica 4:
A Tale of Two Latin Beauties.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.059
Hey.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.480
What?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.190
Awkward.

15:01.358 --> 15:05.236
- Where the hell were you?
- Just working my imaginary case.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.363
Yeah, and...?

15:07.531 --> 15:10.033
Oh, well, you were right.
I didn't find much.

15:10.242 --> 15:13.828
Yeah. Except Angela's boyfriend
died last night, slit his own throat.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.040
But, you know, that's normal.
Uh, let's see. What else?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.459
Oh, he was seeing Angela everywhere
before he died.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.172
But, you know, I'm sure that's just me
transferring my own feelings.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.508
Okay, I get it. I'm sorry.
Maybe there is something going on here.

15:27.676 --> 15:33.097
Maybe? Sam, I know how to do my job,
despite what you might think.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.268
We should check out
the guy's apartment.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.479
I just came from there.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.440
A pile of dead plants,
just like the cemetery.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.983
Hell, dead goldfish too.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.028
- So unholy ground?
- Maybe.

15:47.196 --> 15:51.282
I'm still not getting that powerful
angry-spirit vibe from Angela.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.326
I have been reading this, though.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.291
You stole the girl's diary?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.460
Yeah, Sam.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.547
- If anything, the girl's a little too nice.
- So, what do you wanna do?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.592
- Keep digging, talk to her friends.
- You get any names?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.219
You kidding me?

16:11.387 --> 16:14.097
I have her bestest friend
in the whole wide world.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.768
I didn't realize the college employed
grief counselors.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.646
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you talk, we listen.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.817
Maybe throw in a therapeutic collage.
Whatever helps jump-start the healing.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.987
Well, I think I'm okay. Thanks.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.906
Well, you heard what happened
to Matt Harrison, right?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.449
Yeah, I did.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.202
We just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.455
Grief can make people do crazy things.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.794
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened to him. I am.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.880
But if Matt killed himself,
it wasn't because of grief.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.550
- No? Then why?
- It was guilt.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.596
- Angie's death was Matt's fault.
- How was Matt responsible?

16:55.806 --> 16:58.182
She really loved that guy.

16:58.350 --> 17:02.270
But the night of the accident,
she walked in on him with another girl.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.896
Hmm.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.898
She was really torn up.
That's why she crashed the car.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.362
Um, look, I gotta get ready for work.

17:11.571 --> 17:16.576
So thanks for the concern,
but seriously, I'll be okay.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.375
Well, that vengeful-spirit theory
is starting to make sense.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.711
I mean, hell hath no fury.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.173
So if Angela got her revenge on Matt,
you think it's over?

17:31.675 --> 17:34.343
Well, there's one way to be sure.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.430
Yeah?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.599
- What's that?
- Burn the bones.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.060
Burn the bones?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.604
Are you high?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.939
- Angela died last week.
- So?

17:47.483 --> 17:48.816
There's not gonna be bones.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.861
There's gonna be a ripe, rotting body
in the coffin.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.072
Since when are you afraid
to get dirty, huh?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.892
Ladies first.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.480
Hold that.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.809
I missed you.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.418
They buried the body four days ago.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.711
I don't get it.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.630
Look.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.052
What is that?
I'm not sure.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.098
I've seen
these kinds of symbols before.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.061
Dean, take it easy. Okay?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.237
You're Angie's friends, right?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.822
- Dr. Mason--
- We need to talk.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.367
Well, then, come in.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.745
Thanks.

20:08.957 --> 20:13.169
You teach Ancient Greek. Tell me...

20:13.378 --> 20:15.296
...what are these?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.799
I don't understand.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.594
You said this had something to do
with Angela.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.513
It does. Please, just humor me.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.310
They're part of an Ancient Greek
divination ritual.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.813
- Used for necromancy, right?
- That's right.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.525
Before we came here, we stopped by
the library and did a little homework.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.655
Apparently, they use rituals like this one
for communicating with the dead.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.283
Even bringing corpses back to life,
full-on zombie action.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.452
Yeah.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.121
I mean, according to the legends.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.709
- Now, what's all this about?
- I think you know.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.837
- Dean.
- Look, I get it.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.757
Okay? There are people
that I would give anything to see.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.634
- But what gives you the right?
- Dean.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.803
- What?
- What's dead should stay dead.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.346
- What?
- What you brought back...

21:05.555 --> 21:09.100
...isn't even your daughter.
These things are vicious. They're violent.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.143
They're so nasty, they rot the ground.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.521
I mean, come on,
haven't you seen Pet Sematary?

21:13.981 --> 21:15.940
You're insane.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.985
- Where is she?
- Get out of my house.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.071
I know you're hiding her somewhere.
Where is she?

21:22.239 --> 21:24.365
Dean, stop. That's enough.
Dean, look.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.784
Beautiful, living plants.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.412
- We're leaving.
- I'm calling the police.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.748
Sir, we're sorry.
We won't bother you again.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.587
- What is the matter with you?
- Back off.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.881
That man is innocent.
He didn't deserve that.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.925
Maybe he's keeping her
somewhere else.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.136
Stop it. That's enough, okay? Enough.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.014
- Sam, I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't. At all.

21:48.181 --> 21:51.225
Dean, I don't scare easy,
but you're scaring the crap out of me.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.395
- Don't be dramatic.
- You're lucky this turned out to be a case.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.565
Because if it wasn't,
you would've found something else to kill.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.526
You're on edge. You're erratic.
Except for when you're hunting...

22:00.694 --> 22:03.696
...because then you're downright scary.
You're tailspinning, man.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.700
And you refuse to talk about it,
and you won't let me help you.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.995
- I can take care of myself, thanks.
- No, you can't.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.332
You know what? You're the only one
who thinks you should have to.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.001
You don't have to handle this on your own.
No one can.

22:17.169 --> 22:21.589
- If you bring up Dad's death one more time--
- Stop. Please. Dean, it's killing you. Please.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.675
We've already lost Dad.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.219
We've lost Mom.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.929
I've lost Jessica.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.933
And now I'm gonna lose you too?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.813
We better get out of here
before the cops come.

22:39.441 --> 22:44.236
I hear you. Okay?
Yeah, I'm being an ass. And I'm sorry.

22:44.446 --> 22:48.449
But we got a zombie running around.
We need to figure out how to kill it.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.661
Right?

22:52.871 --> 22:54.538
Our lives are weird, man.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.582
You're telling me.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.002
Come on.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.131
Honey, is something bothering you?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.719
It's about Matt.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.305
- Haven't we talked about that?
- I know, but--

23:11.515 --> 23:14.016
Haven't we wasted
enough time on him already?

23:15.936 --> 23:17.812
Come sit down.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.155
You always said
that he didn't deserve me.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.452
- You were right.
- Angela...

23:35.080 --> 23:38.624
...you didn't get out
and go see Matt, or...?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.210
I've been here the whole time.

23:42.671 --> 23:46.715
Neil, you really think
I could do something like that?

23:47.008 --> 23:48.551
No.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.554
I don't know. I can't help it.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.265
- You just-- You seem--
- Different?

23:56.351 --> 23:59.478
You're right. I am.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.358
I've realized...

24:04.693 --> 24:07.236
...you're the only one
who ever really loved me.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.199
You proved that.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.076
You brought me back.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.079
I'm with you now.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.708
Isn't that what you always wanted?

24:24.588 --> 24:26.547
We can't just waste it
with a headshot?

24:26.715 --> 24:29.508
Dude, you've been watching
way too many Romero flicks.

24:29.718 --> 24:34.054
- So there's no lore on how to smoke them?
- No, Dean, I'm telling you there's too much.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.182
There's a hundred legends
on the walking dead...

24:36.349 --> 24:40.478
...but they all have different methods for
killing them. Some say setting them on fire.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.396
One said-- Where is it?

24:42.564 --> 24:44.565
Right here.
-- feeding their hearts to wild dogs.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.233
That's my personal favorite.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.194
Who knows what's real
and what's myth?

24:48.361 --> 24:52.031
- Is there anything they have in common?
- No. A few said silver might work.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.326
- Silver's a start.
- Yeah. But how are we gonna find Angela?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.120
- We gotta figure out who brought her back.
- Any ideas?

24:58.622 --> 25:01.540
I think if it's not her dad,
it might be that guy Neil.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.042
- Neil?
- Yep.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.879
- How'd you come up with that?
- Well, you got your journal, I got mine.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.839
"Neil's a real shoulder to cry on.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.259
He so understands
what I'm going through with Matt."

25:12.427 --> 25:16.388
There's more in here where that came from.
It's got unrequited Duckie love all over it.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.266
But that doesn't mean
he brought her back from the dead.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.644
Mm. Did I mention that
he's Professor Mason's TA?

25:21.811 --> 25:24.355
Has access to all the same books?

25:29.778 --> 25:31.570
Hello?

25:35.116 --> 25:36.992
Neil.

25:37.702 --> 25:41.205
It's your grief counselors.
We've come to hug.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.501
Silver bullets?

25:45.669 --> 25:48.671
Yeah, enough to make her rattle
like a change purse.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.616
Unless this is where
he keeps his porn.

26:45.395 --> 26:49.440
- Sure looks like a zombie pen to me.
- Yeah.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.442
An empty one.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.946
You think Angela's
going after somebody?

27:05.498 --> 27:07.499
No, I think she went out
to rent Beaches.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.544
Look, smart-ass,
she might kill someone.

27:10.712 --> 27:13.047
We gotta find her, Dean.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.132
Yeah.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.345
All right, she clipped Matt
because he was cheating, right?

27:19.512 --> 27:22.306
- Yeah.
- Well, it takes two to, you know...

27:22.474 --> 27:24.725
...have hardcore sex.

27:25.769 --> 27:29.313
I don't know, it just seemed that
Angela's roommate...

27:29.481 --> 27:32.691
...was broken up over Matt's death.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.819
I mean, like, really broken up.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.965
Hello?

28:04.849 --> 28:06.350
Hi, Lindsey. I'm home.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.114
You know what you did.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.743
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.495
You're not sorry enough!

28:49.310 --> 28:50.936
Oh, God.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.814
Oh, God.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.734
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.682
Hey, I got you. I got you.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.771
Damn, that dead chick can run.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.773
What now?

29:36.691 --> 29:39.193
I say we go have
a little chat with Neil.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.532
So the silver bullets,
they did something, right?

29:45.700 --> 29:48.827
Yeah, something. But not enough.
What else you got?

29:49.287 --> 29:50.329
Um...

29:50.538 --> 29:55.250
Okay, besides silver, we have nailing
the undead back into their grave beds.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.505
It's mentioned a few times. It's probably
where the vampire-staking lore came from.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.841
- Their grave beds? You serious?
- Yeah.

30:03.051 --> 30:06.220
How the hell are we gonna get
Angela back to the cemetery?

30:17.732 --> 30:19.858
What are you guys doing here?

30:21.236 --> 30:25.906
I've heard of some people doing some
desperate things to get laid, but you...

30:26.074 --> 30:28.116
You take the cake.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.743
Okay, who are you guys?

30:29.911 --> 30:32.496
You might wanna ask Angela
that question.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.790
- What?
- We know what you did.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.750
The ritual.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.919
Everything.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.380
Crazy.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.842
Your girlfriend's past her expiration date
and we're crazy?

30:45.009 --> 30:47.636
When someone's gone,
they should stay gone.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.514
You don't mess
with that kind of stuff.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.766
Angela killed Matt.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.518
She tried to kill Lindsey.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.939
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.110
- Hey.
No more crap, Neil.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.653
His blood is on your hands.

31:05.488 --> 31:09.449
Now, me and him can make this right,
but you gotta tell us where she is.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.369
Tell us!

31:14.330 --> 31:17.416
My house. She's at my house.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.512
Are you sure about that?

31:40.523 --> 31:43.734
Listen, it doesn't really matter
where she is.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.320
There's only one way to stop her.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.739
We've gotta perform another ritual
over her grave.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.325
To reverse the one that you did.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.620
We're gonna need some black root,
some scar weed, some candles.

31:55.038 --> 31:59.249
It's complicated, but it'll get the job done.
She'll be dead again in a couple hours.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.752
I think you should come with us.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.966
I'm serious, Neil.
Leave with us, right now.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.344
No.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.387
No.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.519
Listen to me.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.773
Get out of here as soon as you can.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.942
But most of all, be cool.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.361
No sudden movements.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.987
Don't make her mad.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.952
Let's go.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.429
- You said you'd stay in the house.
I'm sorry.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.598
I just needed to see you.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.100
Neil, please.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.562
You have to help me.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.485
Oh, God.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.278
Come with me to the cemetery.

33:10.446 --> 33:13.323
Neil, they're trying to kill me.
We have to stop them.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.908
You mean kill them.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.954
It's true.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.039
- Matt and Lindsey.
- They hurt me.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.419
If you love me,
you'll make sure nobody hurts me again.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.172
Take me to the cemetery,
and then all this will be over.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.800
We can start new lives together.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.263
Okay.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.225
God help me, but okay.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.562
I'll go get the car.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.940
Just... Just wait here.

34:10.505 --> 34:12.049
Neil, you look nervous.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.717
No, I'm fine.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.139
Were you going to leave me?

34:19.806 --> 34:22.851
- No, of course not. I--
- You were, weren't you?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.771
How could you?

34:25.980 --> 34:28.190
- Neil, I loved you.
- Angela--

34:40.995 --> 34:43.705
You really think this is gonna work?

34:43.873 --> 34:45.998
No, not really.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.004
But it was the only thing
I could come up with.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.229
Wait. It's not what you think.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.732
I didn't ask to be brought back.
But it's still me.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.360
I'm still a person. Please.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.273
Wait, don't!

36:50.416 --> 36:52.876
What's dead should stay dead.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.972
- Rest in peace.
- Yeah. For good this time, okay?

37:12.146 --> 37:18.485
You know, the whole fake-ritual thing,
luring Angela into the cemetery...

37:18.653 --> 37:19.903
...pretty sharp.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.655
Thanks.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.324
But did we have to use me as bait?

37:24.492 --> 37:28.453
I figured you were more her type.
She had pretty crappy taste in guys.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.122
I think she broke my hand.

37:31.290 --> 37:35.168
You're just too fragile.
We'll get it looked at later.

37:40.007 --> 37:42.259
You wanna stay for a while?

37:46.973 --> 37:48.640
No.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.251
Dean, what is it?

39:02.548 --> 39:05.133
- I'm sorry.
- You--?

39:05.634 --> 39:07.344
For what?

39:09.263 --> 39:11.431
The way I've been acting.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.659
And for Dad.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.748
I mean, he was your dad too.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.961
- And it's my fault that he's gone.
- What are you talking about?

39:42.171 --> 39:44.798
I know you've been thinking it.
So have I.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.967
Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.

39:49.678 --> 39:53.973
Back at the hospital,
you know, full recovery.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.226
It was a miracle.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.437
And five minutes later,
Dad's dead and the Colt's gone.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.565
You can't tell me
there's not a connection there.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.987
I don't know how
the demon was involved.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.699
I don't know how
the whole thing went down, exactly.

40:12.576 --> 40:15.286
But Dad's dead because of me.

40:16.247 --> 40:20.083
- And that much I do know.
- We don't know that. Not for sure.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.793
Sam...

40:24.422 --> 40:26.714
...you and Dad...

40:29.677 --> 40:32.470
...you're the most important people
in my life.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.931
And now...

40:37.184 --> 40:40.854
I never should've come back, Sam.
It wasn't natural.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.441
And now look what's come of it.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.112
I was dead.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.615
And I should have stayed dead.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.542
You wanted to know
how I was feeling.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.379
Well, that's it.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.176
So tell me...

41:16.390 --> 41:19.851
...what could you possibly say
to make that all right?
