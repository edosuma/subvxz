WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:02.787
- WELL, LOOK, I KNOW HE WAS
HAVING SOME FINANCIAL TROUBLE--

00:02.830 --> 00:04.092
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

00:04.140 --> 00:06.654
HE WENT COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN
ON THIS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT.

00:06.690 --> 00:08.339
- WHAT?
- IT'S A LOT OF LYING.

00:08.380 --> 00:10.689
BEEN GOING ON
FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

00:10.730 --> 00:13.005
NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY.
THERE WAS A WOMAN.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.172
- HEY, SONNY.
- HEY.

00:16.220 --> 00:17.699
- WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
LET ME IN OR WHAT?

00:17.740 --> 00:20.186
- I DON'T THINK THAT
THIS WHOLE THING IS WORKING.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.393
I HAVE TO GO.

00:22.430 --> 00:24.045
WE BROKE UP.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.398
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING WITH HADDIE.

00:25.430 --> 00:26.567
WHAT I'M FEELING NOW

00:26.610 --> 00:29.431
ISN'T WHAT I WAS FEELING
WITH HER.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.438
- THANKS.

00:31.470 --> 00:34.439
[birds chirping, sprinklers]

00:37.270 --> 00:42.207
- HMM.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.868
OH, MY GOD.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.868
OH, MY GOD.
STEVE, GET UP.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.697
GET UP.
PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON.

00:48.730 --> 00:50.072
OH, MY GOD.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.213
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:51.250 --> 00:53.138
- IF YOU TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS, I WILL KILL YOU.

00:53.190 --> 00:54.327
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I WILL KILL YOU.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.214
- AMBER, WHAT IS WRONG?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IS WRONG?

00:56.260 --> 00:57.568
YOU'RE,
YOU'RE HADDIE'S BOYFRIEND.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.739
- I'M NOT HADDIE'S BOYFRIEND.
SHE DUMPED ME.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.179
- IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.
IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.879
I'M HER COUSIN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.194
- IT'S OKAY.
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.367
- LOOK, CAN'T WE JUST
TALK ABOUT THIS?

01:05.410 --> 01:06.604
- NO, WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT IT.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.094
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT
ANYTHING,

01:08.130 --> 01:09.540
BECAUSE THERE'S NO "WE,"
OKAY?

01:09.580 --> 01:11.377
- LAST NIGHT...

01:11.410 --> 01:12.820
I KNOW YOU FELT IT TOO.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.782
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

01:14.830 --> 01:15.854
THIS, THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.516
I CAN'T,
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH YOU.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.699
- AMBER.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.106
[sighs]

01:22.150 --> 01:24.141
- DON'T MOVE YOUR GLASS.
KEEP YOUR GLASS STILL.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.114
- HADDIE.
PUT THAT AWAY FOR ME.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.287
- YEAH.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.834
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
- MOM!

01:29.880 --> 01:31.188
EXCUSE ME.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.426
- MORNING, GRANDPA.

01:32.470 --> 01:33.914
- EXCUSE ME.

01:33.950 --> 01:34.871
- DAD.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.535
- MORNING, DAD.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.197
- COFFEE.
- DO YOU WANT SOME FRUIT?

01:38.230 --> 01:39.367
- YOU SLEEP ALL RIGHT?

01:39.400 --> 01:42.335
- OH, THERE WAS THIS CHIRPING
IN MY HEAD ALL NIGHT.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.883
- OH, THAT--
THOSE WERE MY CRICKETS.

01:43.930 --> 01:47.138
- REALLY?
- YEP.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.376
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING PET.

01:48.410 --> 01:49.650
- DID YOU JUST
PUT THE MILK AWAY?

01:49.690 --> 01:51.169
- YEAH. OKAY.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.178
- OH, MAN, WHAT THE HECK
IS THIS STUFF?

01:53.210 --> 01:54.177
- IT'S HAZELNUT.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.269
- HAZELNUT?
- YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.935
- GEEZ.

01:57.970 --> 01:59.835
- I CAN GET YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.905
- SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:00.940 --> 02:02.384
- UH, I'M GONNA GO TO
THE CORNER.

02:02.430 --> 02:03.829
I'M GONNA GET SOME COFFEE
AND SOME DOUGHNUTS.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.841
- NO.
- MAX, YOU CAN'T HAVE DOUGHNUTS.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.393
- HE GETS TO HAVE DOUGHNUTS
AND I DON'T?

02:08.430 --> 02:09.601
- MAX.
- MAX.

02:09.640 --> 02:10.607
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
- HERE, HAVE SOME FRUIT.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.505
- BECAUSE I GET DOUGHNUTS--
- MAX, SHUT UP.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.644
- WE HEARD YOU SAY THAT.
WE HEARD YOU.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.819
- WHY DON'T YOU EAT SOME FRUIT.
- WHY DOES HE GET DOUGHNUTS?

02:16.860 --> 02:17.929
I DON'T GET DOUGHNUTS!
- MAX.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.190
- SO GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
HAD A FIGHT,

02:20.240 --> 02:21.821
YOU KNOW, LIKE PEOPLE DO.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.828
- WELL, LIKE,
WHAT KIND OF FIGHT?

02:23.860 --> 02:24.849
- I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.583
BUT, UH, GRANDPA'S GONNA STAY
WITH UNCLE ADAM

02:26.620 --> 02:27.894
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.419
- WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.519
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.903
LET'S JUST BE EXTRA,
SUPER NICE TO GRANDMA, OKAY?

02:32.940 --> 02:34.316
DO YOU WANT A REAL DONE ONE
OR A NOT DONE ONE?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.248
_ 1--
JUST CHOOSE, I DON'T CARE.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.769
- HERE. TAKE ONE OF EACH.
HI, HONEY.

02:37.810 --> 02:38.731
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

02:38.770 --> 02:41.227
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
KAYLA WAS SNORING,

02:41.260 --> 02:42.568
SO I COULDN'T,
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

02:42.610 --> 02:43.679
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.849
- LISTEN, UM, GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA HAD A FIGHT--

02:45.880 --> 02:46.983
- OKAY, WELL, WE'LL,
WE'LL TALK LATER, OKAY?

02:47.020 --> 02:49.432
- HI, SWEETIE.
- OKAY.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.544
- HEY, MOM.
LOOK, I MADE PANCAKES.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.229
- YEAH, THEY'RE,
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

02:55.270 --> 02:56.851
- I CAN'T.
I HAVE PAINTING CLASS.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.969
- OH.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.922
- UH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:59.970 --> 03:01.790
UH, YOU KNOW HOW
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

03:01.830 --> 03:03.479
TURNING THE ATI'IC INTO
MY ART STUDIO?

03:03.520 --> 03:04.589
- YEAH.

03:04.630 --> 03:05.836
- YEAH.
I'M FINALLY GONNA DO IT.

03:05.870 --> 03:06.962
- NOW?
- YEAH.

03:07.010 --> 03:07.931
AND THERE'S A LOT OF JUNK
UP THERE.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.356
- JUNK. MOM, THAT'S--

03:09.390 --> 03:10.698
ALL OF OUR CHILDHOOD STUFF
IS UP THERE.

03:10.740 --> 03:12.002
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT

03:12.050 --> 03:13.324
AND SEE WHAT YOU WANT.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.009
AND ASK YOUR BROTHERS
AND YOUR SISTER

03:15.050 --> 03:16.358
IF THEY'LL GO THROUGH IT TOO.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.708
ANYTHING THAT'S IMPORTANT
TO THEM,

03:17.740 --> 03:19.776
THEY SHOULD TAKE HOME,
'CAUSE WHATEVER'S LEFI',

03:19.820 --> 03:23.506
I'M GONNA, YOU KNOW,
EITHER GIVE AWAY OR BURN.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.986
- BURN?

03:26.030 --> 03:28.305
MOM.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.307
- [sighs]

03:29.340 --> 03:32.582
MY DAD IS SO FAR UNDERWATER
ON THIS THING.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.757
- YEAH,
I WAS LOOKING AT THOSE.

03:33.790 --> 03:36.509
- IT'S JUST--
IT'S QUITE A HOLE.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.869
- HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

03:38.900 --> 03:41.414
- UM...THEY'LL BE FINE.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.041
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE THING STARTED

03:43.080 --> 03:45.799
BECAUSE HE WENT UPSIDE DOWN
ON A BAD INVESTMENT,

03:45.840 --> 03:47.569
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DO,
I MIGHT ADD.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.976
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS HELP HIM DIG HIS WAY OUT

03:49.020 --> 03:51.807
AND HE'LL PATCH THINGS UP
WITH MOM IN NO TIME.

03:51.850 --> 03:53.363
- BABE, I LOOKED AT
THE VALUE OF THE LAND

03:53.400 --> 03:54.674
AND THE BUILDINGS.

03:54.710 --> 03:58.669
I--I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU,
YOU DIG HIM OUT OF THAT.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.609
- WELL...
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I,

04:01.650 --> 04:02.787
WHAT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.859
I WAS THINKING
OF CALLING TIMM.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.855
- OH.

04:07.900 --> 04:08.924
- I KNOW TIMM'S NOT
YOUR FAVORITE PERSON.

04:08.970 --> 04:11.416
- NOT EVEN CLOSE.
- BUT HE KNOWS REAL ESTATE.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.860
- WELL, I KNOW REAL ESTATE,
JULIE.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.481
I WAS A CONTRACTOR.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.282
- NO, I KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE'S A FUND MANAGER.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.834
HE HAS A TON OF CONNECTIONS.
THIS IS HIS JOB.

04:18.870 --> 04:21.976
- TIMM.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.976
TIMMMMM.

04:24.020 --> 04:26.011
- OKAY, SO HE HAS TWO "M"s
IN HIS NAME.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.369
LET'S KEEP IT
IN PERSPECTIVE HERE.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.459
- I AMMMM.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.636
- JOEL.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.988
- THE GUY TRIED TO STEAL YOU
FROM ME.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.679
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:33.720 --> 04:35.711
- IT'S FOR MY DAD.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.757
- OKAY.

04:41.790 --> 04:42.927
I'LL DO IT FOR HIMMMM.

04:42.970 --> 04:44.107
- SHUT UP.

04:44.140 --> 04:48.418
- BUT NOT FOR TIMMMMM.
- CUT IT OUT.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.451
- RELAX.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.663
IT'S NOT THE LARGE
SUPER COLLIDER.

04:59.710 --> 05:00.916
- I DON'T THINK
YOU REALIZE THIS,

05:00.950 --> 05:02.941
BUT I HAVE THE PERFECT SYSTEM.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.196
- MM.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.812
- EVERY OTHER WEEKEND, I WOULD
DROP MY DIRTY CLOTHES OFF

05:06.850 --> 05:08.852
AT MOM AND DAD'S,
THEN HAVE TEA WITH HER,

05:08.890 --> 05:11.688
WATCH THE GAME WITH HIM,
AND THEN MAGICALLY

05:11.720 --> 05:12.926
AT THE END OF ALL THAT,

05:12.960 --> 05:14.780
MY CLOTHES WOULD BE FOLDED
AND CLEAN.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.855
- AND HOW LONG DID THIS
GO ON FOR?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.755
- 14 YEARS.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.131
BUT NOW THAT THEY'RE IN
THIS FIGHT,

05:21.180 --> 05:22.898
I CAN'T EVEN STOP BY THERE
'CAUSE IT'S TOO STRESSFUL.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.077
- MM.

05:24.110 --> 05:26.453
- so PERFECT SYSTEM--
PFFI'.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.139
- IT'S A REAL TRAGEDY.
- RIGHT? IT'S A BUMMER.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.351
- YEAH.

05:29.390 --> 05:33.531
OKAY, SO, UM, YOU KNOW ABOUT
SEPARATING COLORS, RIGHT?

05:33.570 --> 05:37.438
- WELL, CLEARLY I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SEPARATE COLORS.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.437
- OH, NO.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.609
- WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO SEGREGATE MY LAUNDRY?

05:40.650 --> 05:42.880
- [laughs]
- HMM?

05:42.920 --> 05:44.057
- DON'T FREAK OUT.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.886
THIS--
LOOK, THIS IS GOOD NEWS, OKAY?

05:45.930 --> 05:47.784
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE CAN AMP UP PRODUCTION

05:47.830 --> 05:50.583
ON THE SUMMER LINE
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.032
ALL RIGHT, UH...

05:53.070 --> 05:56.005
LOOK, THE--LOOK, THE SAMPLES
FOR THE SUMMER LINE

05:56.040 --> 05:58.622
HAVE PRACTICALLY SOLD OUT
AT EVERY STORE WE SENT THEM TO,

05:58.660 --> 06:03.620
SO WE CAN MAKE UP
A LOT OF LOST MONEY HERE.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.592
ALL RIGHT, WELL, JUST--
LOOK, GET THOSE GUYS ON IT.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.709
OKAY?

06:06.740 --> 06:08.776
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

06:08.810 --> 06:11.984
ALL RIGHT? BYE.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.159
- [sniffling]

06:14.200 --> 06:17.852
- YOU OKAY?

06:17.890 --> 06:20.506
- SORRY, I JUST CAME
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AND, UH,

06:20.550 --> 06:22.927
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

06:22.960 --> 06:27.101
- SARAH, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:27.140 --> 06:29.586
- YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
MOM WAS SO UPSET LAST NIGHT?

06:29.630 --> 06:30.938
- YEAH.

06:30.970 --> 06:32.414
I MEAN, IT'S BECAUSE DAD
DIDN'T TELL HER ABOUT

06:32.460 --> 06:33.939
THE INVESTMENTS,
THE BAD INVESTMENTS HE MADE.

06:33.970 --> 06:38.213
[sniffles]

06:38.250 --> 06:41.834
- ADAM, DAD CHEATED ON MOM.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.678
AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL, BUT I,

06:44.710 --> 06:48.988
I JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT.

06:49.020 --> 06:50.499
- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.984
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:52.030 --> 06:53.952
SOMETIME BEFORE WE CAME BACK
FROM FRESNO, I DON'T KNOW.

06:53.990 --> 06:56.026
IT'S OVER NOW, BUT,
YOU KNOW,

06:56.070 --> 06:58.891
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AND
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO UPSET.

06:58.930 --> 06:59.828
- OKAY.

06:59.860 --> 07:00.895
- BUT SHE MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL

07:00.930 --> 07:05.003
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
NOT TO TELL, OKAY?

07:05.040 --> 07:07.031
- ALL RIGHT, I PROMISE.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.598
GOD, THAT SON OF A BITCH.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.040
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

07:19.090 --> 07:21.911
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

07:21.950 --> 07:24.054
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

07:24.090 --> 07:26.650
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

07:26.680 --> 07:29.057
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

07:29.100 --> 07:31.477
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

07:31.520 --> 07:33.784
AND MAY YOU STAY

07:33.830 --> 07:36.105
FOREVER YOUNG

07:36.140 --> 07:38.961
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

07:39.010 --> 07:41.001
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

07:41.040 --> 07:43.793
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

07:43.840 --> 07:46.001
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

07:46.050 --> 07:48.769
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

07:48.810 --> 07:50.903
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

07:50.950 --> 07:52.872
AND MAY YOU STAY

07:52.920 --> 07:55.559
FOREVER YOUNG

07:55.610 --> 07:57.840
MAY YOU STAY

07:57.890 --> 08:00.984
FOREVER YOUNG

08:04.030 --> 08:04.997
- THAT SON OF A BITCH.

08:05.030 --> 08:06.019
- I MEAN, HOW COULD HE DO THIS
TO HER, HOW?

08:06.070 --> 08:07.992
- I DON'T KNOW,
THE SAME REASON ANY OTHER GUY

08:08.030 --> 08:09.304
DOES IT TO THEIR WIFE,
YOU KNOW?

08:09.350 --> 08:11.102
LOW SELF-ESTEEM.
- YEAH.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.869
- THEY TAKE
THOSE LITTLE BLUE PILLS

08:12.900 --> 08:14.060
THAT MAKE THEIR THINGS GO--

08:14.110 --> 08:15.896
- IT'S NOT GENETIC, OKAY?

08:15.940 --> 08:18.795
'CAUSE I WOULD NEVER EVER...
DO THAT TO YOU.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.148
- I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK OF THAT.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.875
I KNOW.

08:21.910 --> 08:23.878
- OKAY, WELL, OF COURSE,
I WOULD NEVER.

08:23.910 --> 08:24.945
- I HOPE NOT.

08:24.980 --> 08:26.777
NO,
I KNOW THAT YOU WOULDN'T.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.118
- [sighs]
- I JUST--

08:28.160 --> 08:30.128
- IT MAKES ME SICK.
- IT MAKES ME SICK, HONEY.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.297
THIS IS AWKWARD TOO,

08:31.330 --> 08:32.649
BECAUSE HE'S IN OUR HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.908
- YEAH, I KNOW.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.712
- BUT I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.
I WON'T ACT WEIRD AROUND HIM.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.956
- YEAH, WE CAN'T, OKAY?
- I WON'T.

08:36.990 --> 08:37.786
I'LL PRETEND
THAT EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.333
- I CAN'T HAVE
THIS CONFRONTATION

08:39.380 --> 08:40.267
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

08:40.310 --> 08:41.641
- ARE YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING

08:41.690 --> 08:43.237
TO JULIA OR CROSBY
OR ANYBODY?

08:43.280 --> 08:44.963
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- OH, MY GOD.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.821
- NO, I DON'T KNOW.
- THIS IS CRAZY.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.977
- OH, COME ON.

08:55.010 --> 08:58.730
- HEY, AMBER. HI.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.738
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:00.780 --> 09:02.566
- NO.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.840
- OKAY.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.744
IT SOMETIMES GETS STUCK.
I MEAN, YOU--

09:05.780 --> 09:07.919
- LOOK, STOP.
YOU HAVE TO STOP, OKAY?

09:07.960 --> 09:10.679
PLEASE, SERIOUSLY.
LEAVE ME ALONE. STOP.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.093
- [sighs]

09:18.140 --> 09:20.233
- SO I CALLED TIMM.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.349
- MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE TIMM?

09:21.380 --> 09:23.940
TIMMBERWOLF?
X-TIMM? TIMM-DOG?

09:23.970 --> 09:25.312
- YEAH, TIMM.

09:25.350 --> 09:26.863
AND HE AND I ARE MEETING
FOR SECOND LUNCH.

09:26.910 --> 09:29.310
- WHAT'S A SECOND LUNCH?
- YOU KNOW--

09:29.360 --> 09:31.146
IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO WHEN
YOU DON'T WEAR SHORTS TO WORK.

09:31.190 --> 09:33.010
- THAT'S SOCIOPATHIC.
- THANK YOU.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.278
- ARE YOU GUYS HEARING
THIS CRAP? SECOND LUNCH?

09:34.330 --> 09:35.945
YOU BELIEVING THIS?
SECOND LUNCH?

09:35.980 --> 09:37.777
- OKAY, WHEN TIMM
PUTS HIS REAL ESTATE ACUMEN

09:37.810 --> 09:39.289
TO WORK ON THIS,
WE WILL NOT HAVE A PROBLEM.

09:39.330 --> 09:40.740
WE WILL HAVE A FIX.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.122
MOM AND DAD
WILL GET BACK TOGETHER.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.889
END. YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.741
- AND I WON'T HAVE TO DO
MY LAUNDRY ANYMORE.

09:46.790 --> 09:47.882
ALL WILL BE RIGHT
IN THE WORLD.

09:47.930 --> 09:49.306
- HOW'S MOM?

09:49.340 --> 09:52.093
- SHE'S, UH, UH, FINE.
SHE'S A LITTLE FRAGILE.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.277
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

09:53.310 --> 09:56.302
- MM. MM.
HOW ABOUT DAD?

10:00.320 --> 10:02.038
- WELL, HE'S HIMSELF.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.069
- YOU'RE SAYING IT LIKE
YOU'RE NOT SURE,

10:03.110 --> 10:04.998
BUT YOU GUYS ARE STILL
LIVING TOGETHER, YEAH?

10:05.050 --> 10:05.948
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.016
- ANYWAY, LISTEN,
MOM WANTS EVERYBODY

10:08.050 --> 10:09.256
TO COME GET THEIR STUFF
OUT OF THE ATTIC, OKAY?

10:09.290 --> 10:10.871
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
IN THERE YOU WANT,

10:10.920 --> 10:12.911
TAKE IT, OTHERWISE
SHE'S GONNA THROW IT OUT.

10:12.950 --> 10:15.191
- WELL, WHAT, IS THAT HER WAY
OF GETTING BACK AT DAD?

10:15.230 --> 10:16.436
- WHAT WOULD THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH DAD?

10:16.470 --> 10:17.949
- 'CAUSE WHAT HE DID
IS UNBELIEVABLE.

10:17.990 --> 10:19.093
- WHOA.

10:19.130 --> 10:20.097
DID YOU GUYS BOTH WAKE UP

10:20.130 --> 10:21.813
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED
THIS MORNING?

10:21.860 --> 10:23.304
- HE SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED.
- OKAY--

10:23.340 --> 10:25.308
- WHAT?
- HE WAS EMBARRASSED, OKAY?

10:25.340 --> 10:27.274
HALF THE COUNTRY'S UNDERWATER
FINANCIALLY.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.413
IT'S NOT LIKE HE DID IT
ON PURPOSE.

10:28.450 --> 10:31.203
- WHEN YOU SAY "EVERYTHING,"

10:31.250 --> 10:32.820
YOU DON'T MEAN THE PIANO.

10:32.870 --> 10:34.007
- WHAT DO YOU THINK,
CROSBY?

10:34.040 --> 10:35.837
EVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING.

10:35.870 --> 10:37.144
- YEAH, WELL, I LEARNED
HOW TO PLAY ON THAT PIANO.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.317
ALL RIGHT?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.112
IT SAYS W.M. SCHAUM & SONS
ON THE KEYS.

10:40.150 --> 10:41.321
I MEAN,
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.736
I NEED THAT PIANO.

10:42.780 --> 10:43.906
- WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SO SENTIMENTAL?

10:43.950 --> 10:45.838
I BET YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT PIANO IN 15 YEARS.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.871
- I CAN TELL YOU
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW

10:47.920 --> 10:49.148
AND I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS
IN THERE

10:49.200 --> 10:50.986
GETTING YOUR HANDS ON IT
BEFORE I--

10:51.020 --> 10:53.887
- CAN I ASK YOU HOW YOU'RE GONNA
PUT A PIANO IN A HOUSEBOAT?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.057
- WHAT ARE YOU,
THE ZONING COMMISSION?

10:55.100 --> 10:56.408
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

10:56.440 --> 10:57.407
- THAT'S THE LEAST OF
OUR WORRIES.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.884
- ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:58.930 --> 10:59.999
- NOTHING.
JUST COME GET YOUR STUFF.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.759
- ADAM.
- WHAT?

11:01.790 --> 11:04.725
- I WILL SOLVE
DAD'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, ADAM.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.206
I'VE GOT THIS. I WILL.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.389
- I KNOW YOU WILL.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.969
- HEY, HADDIE.
- HEY.

11:13.010 --> 11:16.832
- HOW WAS SCHOOL?
- IT WAS FINE.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.848
- HEY, YOU WANT
A VIRGIN SCREWDRIVER?

11:18.880 --> 11:22.816
- NO, THAN KS.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.431
- HEY, SWEETHEART,
I KNOW THINGS ARE TOUGH,

11:24.470 --> 11:26.335
SO YOU HANG IN THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

11:26.370 --> 11:28.918
- OKAY. YEAH.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.746
- AND GOOD FOR YOU
FOR RESISTING

11:30.790 --> 11:33.236
WHEN THAT BOY, YOU KNOW,

11:33.270 --> 11:37.855
WAS TRYING TO GET YOU
TO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH HIM.

11:37.900 --> 11:42.451
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

11:42.490 --> 11:43.934
- YEAH.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.244
THAN KS, GRAN DPA.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.939
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.424
- HEY.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.155
WAIT, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:53.190 --> 11:54.873
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S WRONG?

11:54.920 --> 11:56.740
- GRANDPA.
- OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.987
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:59.020 --> 12:00.055
- NOTHING, OKAY?

12:00.090 --> 12:01.227
I'M JUST GONNA BE ALONE,
ALL RIGHT?

12:01.270 --> 12:02.532
- UH-UH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:02.580 --> 12:03.547
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
WAY TOO MUCH TIME ALONE.

12:03.580 --> 12:05.810
I'M STARTING TO GET WORRIED
A LITTLE BIT.

12:05.860 --> 12:08.328
- MOM. IT'S FINE.
- NO, IT'S NOT FINE.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.348
HADDIE,
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A--

12:10.380 --> 12:12.234
OKAY, DON'T GROSS OUT
AT THE WORD--

12:12.280 --> 12:15.511
BUT A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
SLUMBER PARTY.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.004
YOU KNOW,
INVITE SOME GIRLS OVER.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.177
IT'D BE REALLY FUN.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.006
WE COULD MAKE MUDDY BUDDIES.
NO, NOT FUN?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.109
- I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

12:21.150 --> 12:22.458
- MAYBE I'LL MAKE
HANKY PANKIES.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.001
- MOM.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.142
- WE'LL HAVE FUN,
WE'LL DO THE OUIJA BOARD--

12:25.190 --> 12:27.329
- MOM, STOP.
- WHAT?

12:27.360 --> 12:28.941
NO?

12:28.980 --> 12:30.777
- I DON'T KNOW,
WOULD YOU REALLY DO THAT?

12:30.810 --> 12:33.324
- YES. I AM.
I WANT YOU TO DO THIS.

12:33.370 --> 12:35.509
I WANNA DO THIS FOR YOU.
YOU JUST...

12:35.540 --> 12:37.815
YOU'RE SO DOWN.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.885
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

12:39.930 --> 12:41.989
- THANKS.
- I'LL GET YOU SOME "MICHIS."

12:42.030 --> 12:44.442
- MOCHI.
- MOCHI.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.865
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.277
- [gaSPSJ
OH, MY GOD.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.972
IT'S MY BUNNY.
MY COTTON BALL BUNNY.

12:54.010 --> 12:55.284
DO YOU THINK MOM
WOULD TORCH THAT?

12:55.320 --> 12:58.005
SHE WOULD, RIGHT?
SHE'D TORCH IT IN A SECOND.

12:58.050 --> 12:59.187
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:59.220 --> 13:02.849
- I MEAN, HOW THE HELL DID THEY
GET THIS THING IN HERE?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.017
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.870
- I MEAN, DID THEY ASSEMBLE IT
IN HERE?

13:05.920 --> 13:09.014
- I DON'T KNOW.
HOW WOULD YOU GET IT OUT?

13:09.060 --> 13:10.152
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.021
- PUT IT THROUGH THE WINDOW
WITH A REAL STRONG ROPE?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.163
- THE WHOLE POINT
OF HAVING PARENTS

13:14.200 --> 13:15.883
IS TO KEEP YOUR CRAP
IN THEIR ATTIC.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.898
- MOM WANTS THIS SPACE,
CROSBY.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.511
I THINK WE SHOULD BE
RESPECT FUL OF THAT.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.541
- YOU DON'T THINK THAT
THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

13:21.590 --> 13:22.727
AND NOT REALLY ABOUT
THE SPACE?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.933
- WHY ARE YOU BEING SO
SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THIS ANYWAY?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.961
YOU'VE NOT EVEN BEEN UP HERE
IN TEN YEARS.

13:27.010 --> 13:29.387
- I'M NOT FEELING SENTIMENTAL.
I'M FEELING PRAGMATIC.

13:29.420 --> 13:34.596
I'M PRAGMATICALLY
PRESERVING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE

13:34.640 --> 13:36.153
OF OUR FAMILY'S HISTORY.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.942
AND YOU KNOW--
MOM!

13:37.980 --> 13:39.186
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- MOM.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.948
- HEY, CROS, NO.
- MOM!

13:40.990 --> 13:43.083
- LEAVE--OOH.
- MOM. MOM.

13:43.130 --> 13:45.018
- HEY.

13:45.060 --> 13:46.197
- MOM, I'M SORRY,

13:46.230 --> 13:49.028
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETHINK
THIS ART STUDIO IDEA.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.641
WHY DON'T YOU PAINT
IN THE BACKYARD,

13:50.690 --> 13:52.021
THE GREAT OUTDOORS?

13:52.070 --> 13:53.207
THAT'S WHAT MATISSE DID
AND EVERY--

13:53.240 --> 13:54.377
YOU KNOW, ALL THE GREATS.

13:54.410 --> 13:56.173
- YEAH?

13:56.210 --> 13:57.438
- I'M NOT POSITIVE
ABOUT MATISSE,

13:57.490 --> 13:59.446
BUT I THINK--
I DO KNOW THAT SOME ARTISTS DID.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.242
BUT LISTEN.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.168
I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT THE STUFF IN THE ATTIC.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.357
IT'S, IT'S TOO HARD.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.039
- WELL, I KNOW IT'S PAINFUL,
GOOSE,

14:06.080 --> 14:08.071
BUT YOU KIDS ARE AT THE POINT
WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN HOMES.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.974
- WELL.

14:10.020 --> 14:12.250
- OR WORKING TOWARD HAVING
YOUR OWN HOMES,

14:12.290 --> 14:13.609
AND I CAN'T MAKE THESE DECISIONS
FOR YOU.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.084
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF

14:15.130 --> 14:16.438
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

14:16.470 --> 14:17.880
- WELL, IT'S ALL IMPORTANT.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.262
- CHANGE IS HEALTHY.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.508
- NO, IT'S NOT.
THAT'S AN URBAN LEGEND.

14:22.550 --> 14:25.439
- SOMETIMES YOU JUST
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.096
- [mumbles]

14:28.140 --> 14:29.277
- THERE ARE NO GOOD SNACKS
IN THIS HOUSE.

14:29.310 --> 14:30.277
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

14:30.310 --> 14:31.937
"SOMETIMES YOU JUST
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE."

14:31.970 --> 14:33.483
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT DAD AND HER?

14:33.520 --> 14:34.930
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:34.970 --> 14:37.973
- WELL, HOW SERIOUS IS THIS?

14:38.010 --> 14:39.284
- WHAT AM I, A MIND READER?
I DON'T KNOW.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.457
- WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO--

14:40.500 --> 14:42.047
YOU'RE, YOU'RE ON SITE,
OKAY?

14:42.080 --> 14:45.254
YOU'RE OUR EYES AND EARS
TO THE SITUATION.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.394
WELL, I REJECT THIS.
ENTIRELY.

14:47.430 --> 14:49.432
- THAT'LL HELP.
- I DO, FOR REAL.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.700
THEY'RE GONNA WORK IT OUT
LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.401
END OF STORY.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.024
- TOTALLY, I HOPE SO.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.994
[sighs]

15:00.030 --> 15:01.918
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU HAD LUNCH WITH THE GUY

15:01.970 --> 15:03.619
TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR FATHER'S INVESTMENT

15:03.660 --> 15:04.684
AND NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.413
- IT'S JUST LIKE I SAID.

15:06.450 --> 15:08.008
IT GOT CUT SHORT FOR
THAT CONFERENCE CALL

15:08.040 --> 15:09.109
HE HAD WITH TOKYO.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.552
- OKAY, SO THERE'S NOT
GOING TO BE ANOTHER LUNCH?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.215
- I'M SORRY, I KNOW.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.592
I'M, I'M REALLY--
I'M SORRY.

15:14.630 --> 15:17.042
- TOKYO. WHAT A JERK.
- BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.593
HE'S A JERK BECAUSE HE HAS
A CONFERENCE CALL

15:18.640 --> 15:19.971
WITH SOMEONE IN TOKYO?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.942
- HEY, I'M ALLOWED
TO NOT LIKE PEOPLE.

15:21.990 --> 15:23.708
JUST LIKE
YOU NEVER LIKED STACY.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.706
- WELL, SHE'S NOT LIKABLE.
- SHE IS LIKABLE.

15:25.750 --> 15:29.151
- SHE HAD THAT WEIRD--
THAT THING,

15:29.200 --> 15:31.054
THAT TALL GIRL WAY
OF WALKING AROUND.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.375
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.718
- SO ARROGANT.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.206
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL HAVE HIM OVER FOR DINNER.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.616
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:38.660 --> 15:41.037
- WHAT? I'LL BEHAVE.
- NO, NO, NO.

15:41.070 --> 15:44.585
- AS LONG AS HE DOES.

15:44.630 --> 15:46.382
- YOU WOULD DO THAT?

15:46.420 --> 15:48.047
- YOUR DAD NEEDS HELP,

15:48.080 --> 15:50.116
AND HE'S BEEN SO KIND TO ME
OVER THE YEARS,

15:50.150 --> 15:51.356
WHAT WITH THE EUNUCH JOKES.

15:51.390 --> 15:54.257
I FIGURE IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.019
- SO YOU'D DO THIS FOR ME?

15:56.050 --> 15:58.257
- YES.
- YES?

15:58.300 --> 16:00.018
- YES.
- OH.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.369
IF ONLY HE KNEW
HOW MUCH OF A EUNUCH YOU'RE NOT.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.198
MM. MM, MM.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.366
- LET'S TELL HIM.

16:06.410 --> 16:10.028
[both laugh]

16:10.070 --> 16:11.685
- LET'S KEEP IT
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.415
- OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.419
- HEY, JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE
DON'T NORMALLY

16:16.450 --> 16:18.247
PUT PIANOS ON HOUSEBOATS
DOESN'T MEAN

16:18.280 --> 16:20.077
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,
ALL RIGHT?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.418
I'M AN INNOVATOR.
HOLD THAT.

16:21.460 --> 16:23.075
I'M LIKE THE FIRST GUY
TO BRING A MICROWAVE

16:23.120 --> 16:24.246
ON A HOUSEBOAT.

16:24.290 --> 16:25.598
THEY PROBABLY SAID
THAT GUY WAS CRAZY.

16:25.630 --> 16:29.282
- RIGHT, BUT A MICROWAVE
WEIGHS TEN POUNDS.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.707
- AND A PIANO WEIGHS
SIX MILLION.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.082
- SIX MILLION?

16:33.130 --> 16:34.745
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

16:34.780 --> 16:37.578
I THINK IT'S 600,
WHICH IS WELL WITHIN

16:38.820 --> 16:40.435
BESIDES,
IF THERE'S TOO MUCH WEIGHT,

16:40.480 --> 16:43.028
I'LL JUST START HANGING OUT
WITH TINIER PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.346
LIKE LITTLE MINIATURE,
TINY LITTLE CURLY-HAIRED

16:46.380 --> 16:47.824
MINIATURE PEOPLE!

16:47.860 --> 16:49.680
- WHY DON'T YOU STORE IT
AT ADAM'S?

16:49.730 --> 16:51.174
- YEAH.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.484
I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT
TO HIM.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.033
HE'S ALREADY STORING
MY DAD.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.173
- WELL, IF, UH, YOU'RE NOT
WILLING TO GIVE IT UP,

16:56.220 --> 16:57.619
THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE OTHER OPTION.

16:57.670 --> 16:58.591
- WHICH IS?

16:58.630 --> 17:02.179
- YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A BIGGER BOAT, MATE!

17:02.220 --> 17:04.040
ARR! ARR!

17:04.090 --> 17:07.116
- IS THAT FROM JAWS?
YOU DID QUINT.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.153
AND IT'S RAY SCHEIDER'S LINE.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.668
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S ROY SCHEIDER'S LINE, BUT--

17:13.720 --> 17:16.439
- RIGHT, ROY SCHEIDER'S LINE.
- RIGHT.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.856
WHAT I DO KNOW
IS THAT DINNER IS READY,

17:17.890 --> 17:20.165
SO WHY DON'T YOU COME SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.609
HUH?
- LET'S DO IT.

17:21.660 --> 17:24.788
- ALL RIGHT.
HOT POT, HOT POT.

17:24.830 --> 17:25.580
- WOW.

17:25.630 --> 17:28.838
THIS IS REALLY NICE.
THANK YOU.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.451
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:30.490 --> 17:31.730
IT IS NICE, HUH?

17:31.770 --> 17:33.692
- REALLY NICE.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.696
- OKAY.

17:35.740 --> 17:39.733
- YEAH, IT IS.

17:39.780 --> 17:43.193
- REALLY NICE.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.369

OUT THERE, PASS THE BALL.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.402
THERE YOU GO. HE'S OPEN.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.782
[TV chimes]

17:48.820 --> 17:50.435
WHAT THE HELL IS--

17:50.480 --> 17:52.505
- WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE
UNDER THE SEA

17:52.550 --> 17:54.279
- SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS
- OH, COME ON.

17:54.310 --> 17:56.756
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT THE HELL?

17:56.790 --> 17:58.371
HEY, ADAM.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.752
- SIT DOWN, GRANDPA.
- ADAM! HUH?

18:00.800 --> 18:03.268
ADAM! COME HERE A MINUTE.
YOUR TV'S ALL SCREWED UP.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.311
THE CARTOON THING CAME ON.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.736
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
CALM DOWN.

18:06.770 --> 18:08.738

AND THE CARTOONS SHOW UP.

18:08.770 --> 18:10.385
- IT'S SPONGEBOB.
- OH. OKAY, RELAX.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.636
- SPONGEBOB?

18:11.670 --> 18:12.841
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE OTHER ROOM, OKAY?

18:12.880 --> 18:13.869
- WHAT?

18:13.920 --> 18:14.875
- WE'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
IN HERE.

18:14.920 --> 18:15.841
- I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.507
- YAY, IT'S SPONGEBOB.

18:17.540 --> 18:20.668
- NO, COME ON.
- HAVE A SEAT.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.235
- DAD, COME ON. LOOK.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.921
DAD, I KNOW YOU WANNA WATCH
YOUR GAME.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.758
BUT WE HAVE TO LIMIT
MAX'S TV TIME.

18:29.790 --> 18:31.792
- YES, AND IT HAS TO BE
PREDICTABLE FOR HIM.

18:31.830 --> 18:34.549
- OKAY, SO THE THING IS SET
TO SWITCH TO SPONGEBOB

18:34.590 --> 18:35.511
EXACTLY AT 7:00.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.619
- IT STAYS ON FOR
THE LENGTH OF THE SHOW,

18:37.660 --> 18:39.594
THEN IT TURNS ITSELF OFF;
IT'S LOCKED IN.

18:39.630 --> 18:41.484
- ALL RIGHT, AND EVER SINCE
WE SET UP THE DVR LIKE THIS,

18:41.530 --> 18:42.872
WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE FIGHT
ABOUT THE TV.

18:42.910 --> 18:44.764
- NOT ONE PROBLEM.
- ALL RIGHT?

18:44.810 --> 18:45.902
- IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD FOR MAX.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.282
- [sighs]

18:48.330 --> 18:49.399
- WELL, SO--
[clears throat]

18:49.430 --> 18:51.159
THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS,
I MEAN, EVEN FOR OVERTIMES

18:51.190 --> 18:52.327
OR SOMETHING?

18:52.370 --> 18:55.533
- HEY,

18:55.580 --> 18:56.808

19:15.740 --> 19:17.310
- I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.213
[bell ringing]

19:21.260 --> 19:22.704
- HEY.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.605

19:24.640 --> 19:28.428

BUT COULD ALSO BE REALLY FUN.

19:28.470 --> 19:31.678
UM, WE'RE HAVING

19:31.720 --> 19:32.857

20:03.370 --> 20:05.645

20:05.680 --> 20:07.784
I JUST SAW

ONE BATH.

20:11.070 --> 20:12.139
- OKAY.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.274
DO YOU THINK A PIANO
WOULD FIT THROUGH THAT DOOR?

20:14.310 --> 20:15.823
- UPRIGHT OR GRAND?

20:15.860 --> 20:16.929
- WELL, IT'S NOT
ELTON JOHN'S PIANO.

20:16.970 --> 20:19.791

20:27.880 --> 20:30.565
BEST TEST SCORES

20:30.600 --> 20:31.874
UM, DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY?

20:31.920 --> 20:36.607
- UH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,

20:36.640 --> 20:39.985
BUT, UM, I DID RECENTLY
ACQUIRE A SON.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.430

21:30.800 --> 21:32.415
YOU COULD CALL HIM SKIPPER.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.314
HE LOOKS LIKE A SKIPPER,
DOESN'T HE?

21:34.360 --> 21:36.453
- I THINK I LIKE

21:36.500 --> 21:37.637

21:40.920 --> 21:42.945
NOT VERY GOOD-LOOKING.

21:42.990 --> 21:45.015
ALL THEY DO IS MOVE THEIR HEAD
IN AND OUT AND--

21:45.060 --> 21:46.846
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET

22:16.920 --> 22:18.706

EATING IT ON TV.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.012
IT LOOKS SO GOOD.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.641
OKAY, THAT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE FORMAL FOR PIZZA.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.784

I'M SO SORRY.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.562

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.453

23:24.780 --> 23:25.735
GUY'S LIKE A ROCK STAR.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.089

23:28.130 --> 23:29.461
- AH, THING IS, THEY,
THEY SAY IT'S GONNA BE

23:29.510 --> 23:30.818
A TEN-MINUTE PHONE CALL.

23:30.850 --> 23:32.738
YOU'RE NOT JUST DOTTING
THE "I"s, CROSSING THE "T"s.

23:32.790 --> 23:34.610
THEN SUDDENLY THEY WANT
TO REOPEN ALL THE DEAL POINTS

23:34.650 --> 23:36.129
WE SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS
GRINDING THEM ON.

23:36.170 --> 23:39.549
- THAT'S THE WORST.
- YEAH, THAT SUCKS.

23:39.590 --> 23:40.818

23:47.180 --> 23:49.865

TO GET THAT JOB?

23:49.910 --> 23:51.798
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
IT'S HONORABLE, WHAT YOU DO.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.909

SOMETHING I PICKED UP

23:54.530 --> 23:56.907
IN TUSCANY,
LITTLE VINEYARD LAST MONTH.

23:56.950 --> 23:58.087
- OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.599
- THIS IS THE WHOLE PLACE,
OR--

23:59.640 --> 24:00.868
- THIS IS IT.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.195
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S THE SECOND FLOOR.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.118
BUT SHOULD WE HAVE SOME WINE?

24:05.160 --> 24:07.856
- WINE WOULD BE AWESOME.
- YOUR, YOUR CALL, ABSOLUTELY.

24:07.890 --> 24:08.959
- LET'S START WITH
OUR POOR WINE,

24:08.990 --> 24:11.504
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON
TO THIS TUSCANY.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.929
- SAVE THIS FOR
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

24:14.970 --> 24:16.722
- DAD?

24:16.760 --> 24:18.933

24:21.900 --> 24:23.652

24:23.700 --> 24:27.591

JUST GETTING SOME CLOTHES.

24:29.220 --> 24:31.597
SO HOW'S YOUR MOM?

24:31.640 --> 24:35.770

SHE'S KEEPING BUSY.

24:35.810 --> 24:37.744
- YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
WHAT I AM GOING THROUGH

24:37.780 --> 24:39.156
AT YOUR BROTHER'S HOUSE.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.748
YOU KNOW THAT EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID
RUNS THE JOINT?

24:41.790 --> 24:44.236
AND THE GIRL'S VIRGINITY'S
HANGING BY A THREAD.

24:44.270 --> 24:47.262
ADAM, ADAM CAN'T EVEN WATCH
A BASKETBALL GAME WITH ME--

24:55.700 --> 24:57.793
BOY, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

25:03.700 --> 25:08.808
SO, UH, WHERE ARE YOU GIRLS

IN THE KIMONO.

25:50.850 --> 25:51.987
SHE'S ALL ABOUT DAFFODILS.

25:52.030 --> 25:53.679
SHE SNEAKS THEM
INTO ALL HER PAINTINGS.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.096
- UH-OH.

25:55.130 --> 25:56.688

THE ROOM.

26:09.670 --> 26:10.807
- OH, HE ALWAYS DOES THAT.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.808

26:26.410 --> 26:28.332
CAN I STEAL YOUR MOTHER AWAY
FOR A BIT?

26:28.370 --> 26:30.679
- OH, HE'S--
HE'S GONNA STEAL ME AWAY.

26:30.720 --> 26:34.269
- OKAY.
WELL, STEAL, STEAL, STEAL.

26:38.830 --> 26:41.936
- SO THE PLAN IS TO BUNDLE
YOUR DAD'S HOLDINGS

26:41.970 --> 26:43.767
WITH A BUNCH OF HIGHER-END
PROPERTIES--

26:43.800 --> 26:46.872
BUNDLING IS WHEN WE PACKAGE
A LESS ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT

26:46.910 --> 26:47.979
WITH SOME BLUE CHIPS,
SO AS TO--

26:48.020 --> 26:50.215

26:54.300 --> 26:55.437
A BIG PILE OF CHINA MONEY.

26:55.470 --> 26:56.539
- MM-HMM.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.366
- KEPPLER BUYS THE BUNDLE,
WHICH BUYS OUT YOUR DAD.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.164
AND HE COMES AWAY WITH MAYBE
40 ON THE DOLLAR,

27:01.200 --> 27:03.236
BUT HEY, IT'S A HELL OF
A LOT BETTER THAN 0, RIGHT?

27:03.270 --> 27:05.374
- AND THE KEPPLER GUYS,
WHY ARE THEY INTO IT?

27:05.410 --> 27:06.399

FOR KEEPING THEIR NAME

27:06.450 --> 27:08.850

27:08.900 --> 27:11.721
T.A.R.P. STANDS FOR, UH,

27:27.880 --> 27:30.815
[peaceful string music]

27:32.780 --> 27:34.668

27:34.720 --> 27:37.689

IT'S--

27:37.720 --> 27:38.926
I MEAN, I GET IT, YOU KNOW?

27:38.960 --> 27:42.726
YOU'RE HURT, YOU WANT REVENGE,
BUT THAT, THIS--

27:42.760 --> 27:44.273

27:44.310 --> 27:45.379

27:45.420 --> 27:47.752
THAT LITTLE LADY WITH
THE NECKLACE IS MY MOTHER,

27:47.800 --> 27:49.415
AND THE GUY SHE'S TALKING TO
IS HER ART TEACHER.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.836
- OH, THEY MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.076
[laughs]

27:52.110 --> 27:53.839
- THEY'RE NOT A COUPLE.

27:53.870 --> 27:56.145
THAT WOMAN IS A GRANDMOTHER.

27:56.190 --> 27:57.737
LOOK AT HER FLIRTING
AND GIGGLING.

27:57.770 --> 27:59.704
IT'S LIKE SHE'S IN THE
SEX AND THE CITY MOVIE.

27:59.740 --> 28:00.843
- OH, I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING THAT SEQUEL.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.802
- WELL, SO AM I,
I'M NOT DEAD INSIDE.

28:02.850 --> 28:04.499
BUT THE FACT IS,
THAT GUY'S A HOME WRECKER.

28:04.540 --> 28:06.508
- I AM GONNA GO

28:06.540 --> 28:08.121
- SORRY.

28:13.890 --> 28:16.199

28:16.240 --> 28:17.855
[all talking at once]

28:17.900 --> 28:20.414
- WE'LL PUT A CAT ON IT,
BUT, LIKE, IT'LL LOOK BETTER--

28:20.450 --> 28:21.758
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU LIKE
DEATH CAB?

28:21.800 --> 28:22.516
WHO BURNED THIS?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.960
- OH, UM...NOBODY.

28:25.010 --> 28:26.454
I JUST HAVE TO RETURN THAT
TO SOMEBODY.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.287
- TO WHO?
TO STEVE?

28:28.320 --> 28:29.526
- LET ME SEE THAT.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.529

28:32.570 --> 28:34.845
OOH.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.989

28:37.020 --> 28:38.328
STEVE IS A DOUCHE.

28:38.370 --> 28:39.507

28:39.540 --> 28:41.394
- THE DECEMBERISTS,
IS THIS ONE HIS TOO?

28:41.440 --> 28:44.193
- NO, IT'S NOT.
I LOVE THEM.

28:44.230 --> 28:46.505
- DO IT.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.403
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.338
- HE WAS A TOTAL JERK
TO YOU, COME ON.

28:48.380 --> 28:50.757
- BREAK IT.
- HE TOTALLY DESERVES IT.

28:50.790 --> 28:54.794
- DO YOU THINK I SHOULD,
AMBER?

28:54.830 --> 28:57.003
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.076
- DO IT.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.930
[laughter]

29:00.980 --> 29:03.904

29:26.590 --> 29:29.036
AND HE WASN'T--
HE RAN AWAY!

29:29.070 --> 29:31.482
- DID YOU CHECK EIGHT INCHES
AWAY FROM WHERE YOU LEI-T HIM?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.863
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
- OKAY, HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM.

29:33.910 --> 29:36.049
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HECK
THIS THING IS.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.479
IT JUST DISAPPEARED.

29:37.530 --> 29:38.428
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.906
YOU GO LOOK AROUND THE HOUSE
WITH MOM.

29:40.950 --> 29:42.144
GRANDPA AND I'LL LOOK OUTSIDE,

29:42.190 --> 29:43.464
WE'LL GET HADDIE

- OKAY, WELL, SEE, I--

29:45.610 --> 29:50.843
SON, THIS IS WHERE A DOG

29:50.890 --> 29:52.471
YOU GO, "HERE, SKIPPER.

29:52.510 --> 29:53.579
[makes kissing sounds]

29:53.610 --> 29:54.952
AND YOUR DOG COMES.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.026
YOU DO THAT TO A TURTLE,
NOTHING.

29:58.070 --> 30:00.061
- I'M GONNA GET US
SOME FLASHLIGHTS.

30:04.450 --> 30:05.553
- DE KOONING GETS A ROYALTY

30:05.590 --> 30:07.319
EVERY TIME SOMEONE
LOOKS AT THAT.

30:07.350 --> 30:08.624
- [laughs weakly]

30:08.660 --> 30:10.628
THAT'S AN ART JOKE
I ACTUALLY GET.

30:10.670 --> 30:13.047

WE'RE GONNA GO.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.877

30:29.510 --> 30:30.431
DO YOU WANT ME

30:53.640 --> 30:56.871
[crickets chirping]

30:56.920 --> 30:58.262
- WELL, WE COULD BE OUT HERE
ALL NIGHT

30:58.300 --> 30:59.369
LOOKING FOR THE TURTLE.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.028
- WAIT A SECOND.
I THINK I GOT HIM.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.540
- BOY, IF THAT'S HIM,

31:04.580 --> 31:09.062
I'M GONNA ENTER HIM INTO
A MARATHON.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.660
HEY, LOOK, ADAM,
WHY DON'T YOU AND ME

31:11.690 --> 31:13.931
GO TO THE PET STORE,

31:13.970 --> 31:15.244
AND HE CAN FIND A TURTLE?

31:15.280 --> 31:17.032
- STOP WITH THE DAMN DOG.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.559
- WELL, I MEAN,
YOU REALLY OUGHT TO GET MAX

31:18.600 --> 31:19.908
A REAL PET, ADAM.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.386
- OH, MY GOD,
WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

31:22.430 --> 31:24.569
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.419
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:25.460 --> 31:27.599
- I KNOW THAT
YOU CHEATED ON MOM.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.494
- WHAT?

31:29.540 --> 31:32.259
- YOU HEARD ME.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.608
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

31:33.650 --> 31:38.303
- WELL, DOES IT MATTER?

31:38.340 --> 31:39.568
- THAT'S NONE OF
YOUR DAMN BUSINESS, SON.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.406
- WELL,
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO HER?

31:41.450 --> 31:44.613
- WE DID IT TO EACH OTHER,
ADAM.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.230
IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.656
- WELL, THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

31:47.690 --> 31:51.558
- OH, NO,
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE, SON.

31:51.590 --> 31:52.557
- REALLY? REALLY?

31:52.600 --> 31:54.101
YOU'RE GONNA BLAME MOM
FOR SCREWING AROUND

31:54.150 --> 31:55.287
WITH SOME OTHER WOMAN?

31:55.320 --> 31:58.699
- HEY,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.423
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
46 YEARS,

32:00.470 --> 32:01.596
YOU COME AND TALK TO ME.

32:01.640 --> 32:05.155
UNTIL THEN,
YOU JUST BACK THE HELL OFF.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.032
- OH, MY GOSH.
THANK YOU.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.661
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU--

32:29.700 --> 32:31.668
- WORSE THAN I REMEMBERED.
WAY WORSE.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.978
- I KNOW,
HE'S A MEANS TO AN END.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.011
- I DON'T THINK SO.

32:41.780 --> 32:44.647
WE'RE DONE WITH THAT GUY.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.057
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:47.100 --> 32:49.614
- I DON'T TRUST HIM.

32:49.650 --> 32:52.278
- JOEL, DON'T LET BAGGAGE FROM
A MILLION YEARS AGO

32:52.310 --> 32:54.414
BECOME A FACTOR
IN WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

32:54.450 --> 32:55.587
- JULIA,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT BAGGAGE.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.622
THIS IS ABOUT HIM
BUNDLING MONEY.

32:57.660 --> 32:59.343
LIKE ALL THE CROOKS
WHO GOT THIS COUNTRY

32:59.390 --> 33:00.766
INTO THE WHOLE MESS IT'S IN,
IT'S JUST--

33:00.800 --> 33:03.280
- LOOK.
TIMM IS NOT A CRIMINAL.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.480
- WE COULD FIND SOMEBODY
BETTER.

33:04.530 --> 33:05.622
- WHO?
- TO HELP YOUR DAD.

33:05.670 --> 33:07.422
SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT SUCH
A SCUMBAG.

33:07.460 --> 33:08.529
FOR STARTERS, ME.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.595
I CAN, I CAN DRIVE OUT,

33:10.640 --> 33:12.119
I CAN TAKE A LOOK AT
THE PROPERTY,

33:12.160 --> 33:14.367
EVALUATE IT,
MAYBE THERE'S SOME WAY I CAN

33:14.400 --> 33:16.220
DO SOME WORK ON IT,
UH, BRING THE VALUE UP.

33:16.270 --> 33:17.430
- JOEL.

33:17.470 --> 33:18.539
WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANYTHING
MORE INTO THIS.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.741
THAT'S THROWING GOOD MONEY
AI-TER BAD.

33:20.790 --> 33:25.022
YOU DON'T HAVE A SAY IN THIS.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.514
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

33:26.550 --> 33:27.687
- [sighs]

33:27.720 --> 33:30.200
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN
OVER THE NUMBERS.

33:30.240 --> 33:34.313
AND I'VE BEEN OVER THEM
AND THE HOLE IS HUGE.

33:34.350 --> 33:36.238
AND THERE'S NO ONE
WHO WILL

33:36.290 --> 33:38.622
DO US THIS KIND OF
MASSIVE FAVOR

33:38.670 --> 33:40.558
THAT TIMM'S TALKING ABOUT
DOING.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.498
THE CRISIS IS HUGE.

33:41.530 --> 33:44.215
MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE
IS IN THE BALANCE.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.399
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO SAY.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.392
- OKAY.

33:56.410 --> 33:57.786
- [sighs]

33:57.820 --> 34:01.517
- D00, D00 D00 D00

34:04.210 --> 34:06.792
- MAX KIND OF LOOKS LIKE
A TURTLE.

34:06.830 --> 34:09.526
- I CAN SEE THAT.
- OR LIKE--I MEAN, A TORTOISE.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.289
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.480
- YEAH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

34:12.530 --> 34:14.452
- YEAH.
- SAME SNAPPY LITTLE FACE.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.525
- I KNOW. WHICH IS LIKE
MAX'S FACE, YOU KNOW?

34:16.570 --> 34:18.424
LIKE EVERY DAY--

34:18.470 --> 34:20.563
- HADDIE. CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR ONE SECOND?

34:20.610 --> 34:22.396
- YEAH.

34:22.430 --> 34:23.840
- ABOUT STEVE.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.292
- OH, MY GOD.
I KNOW.

34:26.340 --> 34:27.887
I SAW YOU GUYS TALKING
IN THE CAFETERIA.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.649
HE PROB--
DID HE SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,

34:29.680 --> 34:31.648
BECAUSE HE MAKES JOKES,
AND, LIKE--

34:31.690 --> 34:33.499
- HADDIE, IT'S NOT THAT.

34:33.550 --> 34:34.574
UH--

34:34.620 --> 34:37.589
- WHAT? WHAT?

34:37.620 --> 34:40.373
- NO, I JUST--

34:40.420 --> 34:41.580
THIS IS HARD.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.622
- WHAT?

34:44.660 --> 34:48.835
- I--I SLEPT,
I SLEPT WITH HIM.

34:48.870 --> 34:51.213
- HA HA.

34:51.260 --> 34:52.875
- I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW,

34:52.910 --> 34:54.593
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

34:54.640 --> 34:55.493
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,
HADDIE.

34:55.540 --> 34:59.533
UH, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I, I MESSED UP.

34:59.580 --> 35:02.640
I, I WAS DRINKING
AND HE WAS BEING NICE,

35:02.680 --> 35:05.262
AND I JUST--
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME.

35:05.310 --> 35:07.642
I'M SORRY.
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.578
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

35:09.620 --> 35:12.509
AND I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

35:12.550 --> 35:14.415
PLEASE TRY TO--
- CAN YOU JUST--

35:14.450 --> 35:16.862
CAN YOU, CAN YOU STOP...
TALKING?

35:16.900 --> 35:18.208
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.524
PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.142
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME.
I'M SO SORRY.

35:22.180 --> 35:26.799
PLEASE.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.637
OH, GOD.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.742
- MAX, MAX.
WE ARE GOING TO FIND MILES.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.192
NO, WE'RE NOT!
- I PROMISE.

35:34.230 --> 35:36.437
- YOU CAN'T PROMISE BECAUSE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS!

35:36.470 --> 35:38.358
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT, I CAN'T.

35:38.410 --> 35:41.299
BUT LOOK, MAX, A TORTOISE
IS NEVER REALLY LOST

35:41.340 --> 35:42.853
BECAUSE A TORTOISE CARRIES
ITS HOUSE ON ITS BACK, RIGHT?

35:42.890 --> 35:44.209
- [screams]

35:44.240 --> 35:46.299
- HEY. MAX.

35:46.350 --> 35:48.306
HEY. MAX.

35:48.350 --> 35:50.659
HEY. MAX.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.521
MAX. MAX.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.357
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
OKAY?

35:55.390 --> 35:58.598
ALL RIGHT?

35:58.630 --> 36:00.632
OKAY.

36:13.510 --> 36:16.479
- YOU WAITED UP.

36:16.510 --> 36:18.649
- REVENGE, HUH,
FOR ALL THOSE NIGHTS

36:18.690 --> 36:19.964
I MADE YOU WAIT UP?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.513
- YEAH, RIGHT.

36:21.550 --> 36:23.245
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH NIGHTS
IN THE YEAR.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.508
- MOM.
- WHAT?

36:24.560 --> 36:27.654
- HOW WAS IT?
- OH, IT WAS FUN.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.008
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

36:29.040 --> 36:31.429
- WELL,
UM, WE WENT TO THE--

36:31.460 --> 36:33.599
[chuckles]
THE OTHER ART SHOW.

36:33.630 --> 36:35.450
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
HOW BAD THE ART WAS.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.536
IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE THREW UP
ALL OVER THE CANVAS.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.879
WE GOT OUT OF THERE
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.013
AND WE WENT TO, UM, UH,
A BAR.

36:42.060 --> 36:43.709
IT WAS A PUB.
IRISH PUB.

36:43.750 --> 36:47.368
WE HAD IRISH COFFEE.
AND, UH, IT WAS NICE.

36:47.410 --> 36:49.298
THERE WAS A,
THERE WAS A BAND THERE

36:49.340 --> 36:50.648
THAT WASN'T SO GREAT.

36:50.690 --> 36:52.544
SO WE LEI-T THERE AND WE WENT
BACK TO MATTHEW'S PLACE.

36:52.580 --> 36:56.346
AND, UM, HE MADE US A FIRE

36:56.380 --> 36:58.723
AND, UH,
SERVED US SOME PORT.

36:58.760 --> 37:02.764
AND WE TALKED, AND, UM...

37:06.500 --> 37:07.831
AND, UM...

37:07.880 --> 37:09.973
- AND?

37:20.750 --> 37:22.741
OH, MOM.

37:33.830 --> 37:34.933
- GO SLOW.

37:34.970 --> 37:36.039
- I'M LOSING IT.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.968
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
BRAVERMAN, COME ON. DIG DEEP.

37:38.010 --> 37:40.353
- NO, I CAN'T.
ALL RIGHT, EASY. EASY.

37:40.390 --> 37:41.937
OH, GOD, OH, GOD,
I'M LOSING IT.

37:41.980 --> 37:44.869
- COME ON, DIG DEEP.
- OH, OH, GOD.

37:44.910 --> 37:46.013
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

37:46.050 --> 37:47.699
THIS IS A PRICELESS
INSTRUMENT.

37:47.740 --> 37:50.914
HEY, HEY, NEPHEW OF MINE,
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

37:50.950 --> 37:52.360
- ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.503
- HE'S NOT THE ONE
WHO'S MAKING HIS NEPHEW

37:53.540 --> 37:55.053
CARRY A PIANO DOWN THE STAIRS.
- EXACTLY, EXACTLY.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.715
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

37:57.580 --> 37:58.854
- JUST--
DO YOU NEED ME TO GET IT?

37:58.890 --> 38:00.369
- YEAH,
WOULD YOU JUST GRAB THIS?

38:00.410 --> 38:01.684
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.369
OKAY.
- YOU GOT IT?

38:03.410 --> 38:06.299
- I'M HOLDING IT, YEAH.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.625
- OH.
OH, DON RICKLES IS HERE.

38:08.660 --> 38:10.412
THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER
MADE A JOKE,

38:10.460 --> 38:11.654
AND YOU DECIDE TO DO IT
WHEN I'M HOLDING A PIANO.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.383
- IT FELT PRETTY GOOD.

38:13.420 --> 38:14.694
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

38:14.740 --> 38:16.116
- I'M NEVER ASKING YOU GUYS
TO HELP ME

38:16.150 --> 38:17.526
MOVE ANYTHING EVER AGAIN.

38:17.570 --> 38:20.038
- YOU PROMISE?
- EXCELLENT.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.705
- COME ON, LET'S GO,
GO, GO, GO, GO!

38:21.740 --> 38:23.708

38:23.740 --> 38:27.676

MOMMY.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.886
YOU LOOK LIKE A PRINCESS.

38:31.930 --> 38:33.739
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S PROM.

38:33.790 --> 38:34.996
- IS THAT DADDY?

38:35.030 --> 38:38.409
- NO, SWEETIE,
LOOK AT IT.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.657
IT'S MY FRIEND, TIMM.

38:40.690 --> 38:45.696
- TIMMMMM.

38:45.730 --> 38:46.628
- COME ON BACK.

38:46.660 --> 38:47.866

38:47.910 --> 38:49.696
-AH!

38:49.740 --> 38:51.662

38:51.700 --> 38:52.564

38:59.020 --> 39:00.055
- YES!

39:00.090 --> 39:01.671
- I ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING.
THANKS.

39:01.710 --> 39:03.120
- WHOO!

39:03.160 --> 39:05.549
AND YOU SAID
IT COULDN'T BE DONE.

39:05.580 --> 39:06.569
OKAY.

39:06.620 --> 39:09.612
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR
NOT-SO-HEROIC EFFORTS,

39:09.650 --> 39:13.825
I PRESENT TO YOU SOLACE,
A MEXICAN SERENADE.

39:13.860 --> 39:15.999
- NO!
- NO!

39:16.040 --> 39:17.689
- PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.413
- WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT ONE?

39:19.460 --> 39:21.451
- OH, IT'S A SONG HE PLAYED
FOR HIS SIXTH GRADE RECITAL.

39:21.490 --> 39:22.798
- WE'VE HEARD IT
LIKE 10,000 TIMES.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.489
- TEN MILLION.
- I WANNA HEAR IT.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.736
- IT'S GONNA BRING ME
BACK IN TIME

39:25.770 --> 39:26.998
TO A VERY UNATTRACT IVE
HAIRDO.

39:27.050 --> 39:29.462
- KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER, DOESN'T IT?

39:29.500 --> 39:31.912
- AW. IT SOUNDS GOOD.

39:31.950 --> 39:34.157
- IT'S NOT AS AWFUL AS
I REMEMBER IT.

39:34.190 --> 39:36.579
- OH, SOME SONGS NEVER GET OLD,
RIGHT?

39:36.610 --> 39:37.463
- EXCEPT THAT ONE.

39:37.510 --> 39:38.818
- EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE,
THAT'S RIGHT.

39:38.850 --> 39:40.408
- I LIKE IT.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.499
- OH, PLEASE.

39:42.550 --> 39:44.472
- GO AHEAD, JOEL.
- MAY I?

39:44.520 --> 39:45.646
- YEAH, GIVE JASMINE A WHIRL.

39:45.690 --> 39:46.918
- OH, HERE WE GO, YES.

39:46.970 --> 39:49.996
- JOEL! JOEL,
LET'S KEEP A LITTLE DISTANCE.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.689
- WHOO!

39:51.730 --> 39:53.129
- I'LL DO A--
I'LL JUST DO A--

39:53.180 --> 39:56.593
- DO I GET A DIP?
- YEAH.

39:56.630 --> 39:57.938
- YOU KNOW WHO'S A GOOD DANCER.

39:57.980 --> 39:59.868
AUNT SARAH.

39:59.910 --> 40:01.525
SHE HATES TO DO IT,
BUT ONCE SHE GETS STARTED,

40:01.570 --> 40:03.219
BOY,
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING HER.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.783
- WELL.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.549
LOOK WHO'S THE HERO.

40:50.580 --> 40:52.957
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM?
- HE WAS IN MY SHOE.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.924
THEY DON'T HAVE A VERY GOOD
SENSE OF SMELL.

40:55.970 --> 40:57.164
- WELL,
MAX IS GONNA BE THRILLED.

40:57.210 --> 40:59.519
WHY DON'T YOU GO
GIVE IT TO HIM?

40:59.560 --> 41:01.130
- OH, NO, HERE,
YOU GIVE IT TO HIM.

41:01.180 --> 41:04.069
- ALL RIGHT.

41:04.110 --> 41:06.761
HERE, BUDDY.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.634
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
SONNY,

41:10.670 --> 41:12.524
YOU'RE TEN TIMES THE FATHER
I EVER WAS.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.629
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- YES, IT IS.

41:14.670 --> 41:18.015
- FIVE TIMES MAYBE.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.743
- MILES!
- YEAH.

41:19.780 --> 41:21.577
- MILES!
- GRANDPA FOUND HIM.

41:21.610 --> 41:23.749
- MILES!

41:23.790 --> 41:25.781
- [sighs]

41:28.340 --> 41:32.162
- I THINK YOUR MOM'S
GONNA FORGIVE ME.

41:32.210 --> 41:36.658
- I WOULDN'T.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.907
BUT THEN AGAIN, I HAVEN'T BEEN
MARRIED FOR 46 YEARS.

41:42.770 --> 41:44.522
- [chuckles]
