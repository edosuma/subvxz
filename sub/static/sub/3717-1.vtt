01:06.628 --> 01:10.462
Evacuations are in progress. All...

01:11.712 --> 01:13.128
...martial law.

01:13.295 --> 01:15.545
Evacuations are in progress.

01:15.712 --> 01:19.170
All residents are... to their
designated quarantines.

01:20.170 --> 01:22.087
Martial law...

01:22.753 --> 01:24.503
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.337
It's okay.

01:35.670 --> 01:38.212
Please. I need to know
if he's on the other bus.

01:38.378 --> 01:41.378
- We can check when we stop, ma'am.
- But my son.

01:41.545 --> 01:42.878
Ma'am...

02:13.295 --> 02:18.211
Alpha One, this is Alpha Two, over.
One, this is Two. Do you copy?

02:18.378 --> 02:20.795
Why are we stopped short
at the gate? Over.

02:21.628 --> 02:23.295
Alpha One, this is Alpha...

02:24.211 --> 02:26.295
What the fuck?

02:26.961 --> 02:29.836
What's happening?
You have to tell us what's happening.

02:30.003 --> 02:31.378
Open the door.

02:33.503 --> 02:36.378
It's all fine.
Everyone stay in the seat and quiet.

02:36.545 --> 02:38.795
Open the door.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.420
And close it behind me.

02:42.586 --> 02:45.878
No one gets on or off till I get back.

03:21.003 --> 03:22.628
Alpha Two, do you copy?

03:25.336 --> 03:27.795
Alpha Two, do you copy?

03:29.628 --> 03:32.753
Alpha Two, do you copy?

03:54.003 --> 03:57.128
- Open the door.
- Yeah. I don't think that's a good idea.

04:23.628 --> 04:25.336
Okay. Close the door behind me...

04:34.295 --> 04:35.836
Patrick.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.920
We need to protect ourselves.
That soldier out there's got two guns.

05:03.586 --> 05:07.253
I don't know.
Maybe we should sit tight, man.

05:09.461 --> 05:10.795
I'm going out.

05:10.961 --> 05:12.128
You got my back.

05:12.295 --> 05:14.045
Come on. Let me go. Quick.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.294
What's happening?

06:19.794 --> 06:21.669
No, no, no.

06:24.294 --> 06:25.794
Patrick.

07:26.419 --> 07:27.669
Emma.

07:30.253 --> 07:31.628
Emma.

07:32.211 --> 07:33.711
- Emma.
- Stop...

08:09.336 --> 08:11.836
It's me, it's me, it's me.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.253
Emma.

08:14.419 --> 08:15.503
Where's Emma?

09:04.086 --> 09:06.461
No. No.

09:07.877 --> 09:10.127
No. No.

09:11.461 --> 09:12.794
Leave me alone.

09:12.961 --> 09:14.211
No.

09:16.794 --> 09:18.502
No.

09:19.044 --> 09:20.169
No.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.919
No.

09:28.627 --> 09:30.336
Jack. Jack.

09:30.502 --> 09:32.336
It's okay. I got her.

09:33.919 --> 09:36.169
It's okay. I got her.

09:39.169 --> 09:40.336
You're okay.

09:40.502 --> 09:41.794
- Jack.
- Emma.

09:43.169 --> 09:46.211
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.377
- No, no, no.
- Baby, stop.

09:49.544 --> 09:51.169
- She's bleeding.
- Oh, shit.

09:51.336 --> 09:52.794
- What's that?
- I don't know.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.502
It's not hers.

09:56.669 --> 09:58.252
It's not hers.

11:42.461 --> 11:44.336
Get away from the window, please.

11:45.127 --> 11:47.461
He killed another animal.

12:00.669 --> 12:02.502
Time for homework.

12:04.877 --> 12:07.961
I can't remember
what real meat tastes like anymore.

12:23.169 --> 12:25.169
Photo. Photosynthesis.

12:25.336 --> 12:27.211
- Can you spell it?
- F-O...

12:27.377 --> 12:28.877
F.

12:30.169 --> 12:32.960
What other letters make the sound "F"?

12:35.460 --> 12:37.377
- P-H?
- Very good.

14:14.335 --> 14:15.794
Patrick Thornton here...

14:15.960 --> 14:20.794
broadcasting out of Harmony on 109.9.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.377
Can anybody read me?

14:38.085 --> 14:40.460
Now, that is a real shame.

14:40.627 --> 14:43.460
Because we've got a very special show...

14:43.627 --> 14:46.502
in store for you today on Radio Harmony.

14:46.669 --> 14:51.210
Chock-full of contests, interviews...

14:51.502 --> 14:54.294
fantastic musical numbers.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.585
So let's begin with today's guests.

14:58.294 --> 15:00.669
How you doing, John Doe?

15:01.294 --> 15:04.752
"I'm doing good, Patrick. Really good."

15:05.960 --> 15:08.419
And so tell me, John. Are you happy?

15:08.585 --> 15:10.627
"Of course, Patrick. Why wouldn't I be?"

15:10.960 --> 15:14.960
Well, maybe because you haven't talked
to anybody for nine years...

15:15.127 --> 15:18.294
besides your stupid dog.

15:18.627 --> 15:23.460
All right. Let's get to the weather:
The forecast for tonight is cold.

15:23.627 --> 15:25.585
Tomorrow, cold.

15:25.752 --> 15:28.627
The day after tomorrow, cold.

15:31.294 --> 15:33.460
Next year...

15:34.669 --> 15:38.794
Well, let's move on
to the question-and-answer contest.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.169
Now, this first one is easy.

15:41.335 --> 15:45.127
Whoever gets it right
wins an all-expense-paid trip...

15:45.294 --> 15:49.169
to the end of the fucking earth.

15:49.835 --> 15:54.960
And the crowd goes crazy
with anticipation.

15:55.127 --> 15:57.377
All right. Now, here's the question:

15:57.544 --> 16:00.002
Where the hell is everybody?

16:21.918 --> 16:23.127
Good night, Lu.

16:53.127 --> 16:54.585
Lu?

16:56.460 --> 17:00.043
You know I don't like it when you go
downstairs without telling me.

17:00.293 --> 17:01.793
I didn't wanna wake you.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.460
Anyway, I'm big now.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.960
There are bedtimes you need to follow.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.292
You'll be big...

17:15.460 --> 17:17.792
when I tell you you're big.

17:31.835 --> 17:34.418
Can I have another cookie?
I'm still hungry.

17:34.585 --> 17:36.460
But that was...

17:36.793 --> 17:39.293
You're not hungry, you're bored.

17:39.835 --> 17:43.793
When you're finished, brush your teeth,
or you won't get any more cookies.

17:44.252 --> 17:48.377
- I don't like brushing my teeth. It hurts.
- Because you don't brush your teeth.

17:48.543 --> 17:51.252
No, I don't like brushing my teeth
because it hurts.

17:51.418 --> 17:54.127
It hurts because you don't
brush your teeth.

18:01.127 --> 18:02.168
Okay...

18:06.377 --> 18:08.502
Yeah. I'm coming.

18:38.543 --> 18:41.252
Hey, doggy. Hey, buddy. Did you miss me?

18:41.418 --> 18:42.543
Did you miss me?

18:42.710 --> 18:44.960
I saw a really cool episode yesterday.

18:45.127 --> 18:47.460
Ramble asked Mamble out. She said no.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.377
Because he didn't bring her flowers.

18:50.543 --> 18:53.960
I'd already seen it,
but it was funnier this time.

19:03.918 --> 19:05.585
Hey, doggy. Did you do this?

19:05.752 --> 19:07.335
Did you dig the hole yourself?

19:07.502 --> 19:09.502
Good boy.

19:11.877 --> 19:14.043
Now I can give you cookies even better.

19:14.210 --> 19:16.043
Just don't tell Dad.

19:16.502 --> 19:18.168
He'll cover it back up.

19:22.668 --> 19:24.127
No.

19:25.918 --> 19:28.918
Where the hell do you run off to
every morning anyway?

19:30.460 --> 19:31.793
Yeah.

19:37.126 --> 19:38.460
Two times five.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.001
Ten.

19:41.168 --> 19:43.626
Five times three.

19:43.793 --> 19:45.585
Fifteen?

19:45.751 --> 19:48.751
Nine times 14.

19:51.126 --> 19:53.293
No counting on your fingers.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.960
No counting on your fingers.

19:58.126 --> 20:01.001
- Dad, how did you know?
- I know everything.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.376
Well?

20:05.293 --> 20:07.126
You know this.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.293
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

20:12.460 --> 20:14.710
I think it's recess time.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.460
Few more minutes.

20:23.251 --> 20:24.293
All right.

20:31.585 --> 20:33.126
Hey, Dad?

20:33.293 --> 20:34.710
Can I shoot?

20:34.876 --> 20:36.918
I already told you no.

20:37.418 --> 20:38.793
What?

20:41.710 --> 20:44.126
I said it's not a kiddie game.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.126
Then stop shooting
and come play with me.

20:47.668 --> 20:49.501
I'm bored.

20:54.501 --> 20:56.668
You don't like playing
with your dollies?

20:58.460 --> 21:00.418
I'm too big to be playing with dolls.

21:01.126 --> 21:03.126
Oh, yeah? Who told you that?

21:05.126 --> 21:06.793
Too big, huh?

21:07.960 --> 21:09.460
What do you wanna play?

21:12.001 --> 21:15.918
How about I be the teacher,
and you be my student?

21:16.085 --> 21:17.585
Okay.

21:21.085 --> 21:24.460
You again, Jack. And you didn't
do your homework this time...

21:24.626 --> 21:27.626
because you think you're Mr. Big Shot.

21:27.793 --> 21:30.126
I'm really sorry, ma'am. I'm...

21:30.293 --> 21:33.501
- It won't happen again.
- Dad, do it right. In a kid's voice.

21:35.126 --> 21:37.626
I'm sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again.

21:37.793 --> 21:41.626
Dad, I said do it in a kid's voice.
Not a squirrel one.

21:41.793 --> 21:45.960
I ate a squirrel. That's why I sound
like this. I have a squirrel in my tummy.

21:46.126 --> 21:48.668
He'd like some food. He's hungry.
He likes little girls.

21:48.835 --> 21:52.210
He wants to eat little girls alive.
I eat everything.

21:52.626 --> 21:54.085
Dad...

22:04.251 --> 22:06.085
I'm hungry.

22:54.293 --> 22:57.376
All done. Face and teeth, Daddy.

23:02.334 --> 23:04.834
We should get her new flowers.

23:09.626 --> 23:11.793
- What is it?
- Open it.

23:34.293 --> 23:36.126
Cool.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.793
Who's that?

23:41.626 --> 23:44.209
That's your mom
when she was really young.

23:44.376 --> 23:47.418
All these things were hers.

23:53.209 --> 23:56.543
But why are you giving me
all these today?

23:56.793 --> 23:59.043
You don't know what today is?

24:01.126 --> 24:02.959
Today...

24:05.793 --> 24:07.959
Is it my birthday already?

24:09.376 --> 24:13.126
Happy birthday, happy birthday

24:13.293 --> 24:17.501
Happy birthday to you

24:23.209 --> 24:25.543
How about you take it to her?

24:26.418 --> 24:30.959
Because I'm pretty damn sure Jack
wouldn't open the fucking door to me.

24:37.293 --> 24:38.876
The last dog alive.

24:39.043 --> 24:41.376
And the stupidest one.

24:45.793 --> 24:48.501
- House.
- No.

24:52.126 --> 24:53.709
- Loud.
- Nope.

24:53.876 --> 24:56.959
No. I give up.

24:57.459 --> 24:58.959
- It's mouse.
- Mouse?

24:59.709 --> 25:03.168
- That's wasn't a mouse.
- That was so a mouse.

25:04.293 --> 25:07.126
Before there were lots of kids
at birthdays, right?

25:07.293 --> 25:11.043
Absolutely, and you can invite
anybody you want.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.043
They all brought you presents?

25:15.584 --> 25:17.501
But is it true...

25:17.793 --> 25:19.751
or just a story?

25:20.209 --> 25:22.834
Why would I make something like that up?

25:23.293 --> 25:28.418
I don't know, it's just,
I've never seen any other kids before.

25:32.376 --> 25:35.084
Don't even remember ever seeing Mom.

25:37.584 --> 25:41.709
Honey, I'm telling you the truth.
And your mom, you knew her.

25:42.501 --> 25:43.793
You were just little.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.293
That's why you can't remember.

25:57.626 --> 25:59.793
Now that I'm grown up...

26:00.126 --> 26:02.376
you can tell me the truth.

26:05.001 --> 26:06.959
Do the monsters really exist?

26:09.709 --> 26:11.293
They did.

26:13.251 --> 26:16.793
But there are no more left.
They all died from the cold.

26:18.584 --> 26:20.751
I'm cold, though, and I'm not dead.

26:20.918 --> 26:24.001
Well, that's because you're
a very strong young lady.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.668
- And grown-up.
- And... No, not grown-up.

26:26.834 --> 26:29.959
- Oh, I'm very grown-up.
- Very grown-up. Grown-ups dance.

26:30.126 --> 26:32.292
Come on, honey. Come on, Lu.

26:36.292 --> 26:38.459
Spin.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.959
That's all for today.

27:10.626 --> 27:13.834
This is 109.9.

27:15.751 --> 27:18.834
Somebody fucking answer me.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.292
Hello?

27:34.459 --> 27:35.959
Hello, this is...

27:36.126 --> 27:39.459
This is Patrick Thornton in Harmony.

27:39.626 --> 27:42.042
I'm 109.9. Do you read me?

27:43.126 --> 27:44.626
Hello?

27:44.959 --> 27:46.626
Hello? Do you hear me?

27:47.292 --> 27:48.709
Hello?

27:48.876 --> 27:51.167
Do you read me? Hello?

29:32.126 --> 29:33.667
Lu?

29:48.209 --> 29:50.126
What are you doing under there?

29:51.417 --> 29:53.626
Would you come out here, please?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.459
Lu, come out here.

29:55.792 --> 29:56.959
Lu.

29:59.125 --> 30:02.209
All right. Move over. I'm coming in.

30:04.625 --> 30:07.125
Come on. Scooch over.

30:11.584 --> 30:14.292
Now will you tell me
what you're doing under here?

30:17.375 --> 30:20.084
I saw a monster last night.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.959
Out the window.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.459
What did it look like?

30:28.750 --> 30:32.084
Like Ramble...

30:32.667 --> 30:36.459
but really white instead of Grey.

30:39.292 --> 30:41.125
And no hair.

30:41.542 --> 30:43.459
Claws too.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.917
Oh, and fangs.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.167
I think.

30:47.334 --> 30:50.292
Honey, that was a bad dream.
You were having a nightmare.

30:50.459 --> 30:55.792
No. First, I had the nightmare,
then I woke up and saw the monster.

30:57.042 --> 31:00.917
You said so yourself that before,
there were monsters that killed mom.

31:01.084 --> 31:04.292
And all those monsters have died
from the cold.

31:04.959 --> 31:07.834
And they didn't look like Ramble.

31:11.042 --> 31:12.959
If they all died...

31:14.167 --> 31:16.959
then why do you keep
so many locks on the door?

31:17.125 --> 31:19.209
You never let me go out.

31:19.375 --> 31:22.792
Not even to get food with you
from the other houses.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.959
Do you wanna go with me
to get some food?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.584
Okay.

31:34.917 --> 31:36.250
Okay.

31:36.417 --> 31:39.709
Let's go down to the kitchen
and get some food. Come on.

31:43.625 --> 31:44.667
Wait, what?

31:55.459 --> 31:56.792
Okay, bunny.

31:56.959 --> 32:01.792
I need you to not let anybody but doggy
in this hole. Okay?

32:02.792 --> 32:04.375
Thank you.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.792
Come on.

32:25.417 --> 32:26.917
So...

32:27.917 --> 32:29.500
you're the one.

32:30.375 --> 32:36.125
The one responsible
for my dog's daily disappearing act.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.334
If you give him too many treats,
he could go blind.

32:42.959 --> 32:44.959
The... The dog, he...

32:45.125 --> 32:48.459
You can... You can eat
as many cookies as you'd like.

32:48.625 --> 32:51.209
Get away from her.
Don't you look at her.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.042
Don't you come near her.
Don't you talk to her.

32:57.459 --> 32:58.667
You shut that dog up...

32:58.834 --> 33:01.292
or I swear to God,
I will put a bullet in him.

33:02.125 --> 33:04.125
No, doggy's my friend.

33:04.292 --> 33:06.542
Dog. Dog, shut up.

33:09.834 --> 33:11.292
Come on.

33:59.292 --> 34:00.792
Dog.

34:16.958 --> 34:21.125
Jesus, Patrick.
Quit making noise or they'll catch us.

34:24.125 --> 34:25.625
That what you say to Jack?

34:25.792 --> 34:29.125
"Don't make too much noise,
or Patrick will catch us"?

34:29.292 --> 34:33.125
You and Jack...

34:39.375 --> 34:40.750
Dog.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.833
Come on.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.208
Dog.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.458
Dog, quiet.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.208
Dog. Dog, run. Run.

36:21.458 --> 36:22.917
Dog.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.042
Go, go, go.

36:35.542 --> 36:36.833
Come on.

36:39.542 --> 36:40.792
Come on, Dog.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.792
Come on, Dog.

36:46.542 --> 36:48.958
Run. Come on. Come on.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.041
It's too heavy.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.333
Hold with both hands.

37:37.916 --> 37:40.083
This is your sight. Like your finger...

37:40.250 --> 37:42.125
- aim right at the bottle.
- Okay.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.500
Put your finger on the trigger.

37:44.666 --> 37:46.041
Squeeze it.

37:46.208 --> 37:47.958
I can't.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.541
Hold on. Take your finger off.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.750
Okay. Wait.

37:56.166 --> 37:57.958
Okay. Aim at the bottle.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.458
Squeeze the trigger.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.125
A little harder.

38:07.708 --> 38:10.125
That was so much fun, Daddy.
Can I do it again?

38:10.583 --> 38:11.958
Can I, Daddy? Please?

39:05.458 --> 39:09.291
Now, next time, what I want you to do...

39:11.750 --> 39:13.291
You see it?

39:18.125 --> 39:19.500
Can I shoot it?

39:19.666 --> 39:21.166
How hungry are you?

39:25.208 --> 39:27.583
You better do it this time.

40:01.916 --> 40:03.833
Stay there.

40:24.916 --> 40:25.958
Jack.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.249
Hey.

40:30.791 --> 40:32.166
Run, Jack.

40:43.291 --> 40:46.958
Lu, are you all right? Look at me.
You okay, baby? Are you hurt?

40:51.958 --> 40:54.624
Get in the house.
Get in the house now. Go on.

40:54.791 --> 40:56.541
Get behind the gate.

41:12.041 --> 41:13.208
Shoot it.

41:13.374 --> 41:15.499
Lock the gate,
and get in the house. Now.

41:20.916 --> 41:21.958
Shoot.

41:56.374 --> 41:57.624
No.

42:33.541 --> 42:35.499
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get off me.

42:35.666 --> 42:37.416
- No.
- Get off me. Get off me.

42:37.583 --> 42:39.708
Honey, calm down. Honey, hey. Listen.

42:39.874 --> 42:41.124
Listen up. Listen to me.

42:41.291 --> 42:44.416
Honey. Listen to me.

42:46.583 --> 42:49.291
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:50.499 --> 42:52.166
Lu, honey.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.999
Hey.

43:08.624 --> 43:12.999
What did I tell you
about playing the hero, huh?

43:13.374 --> 43:15.208
What did I tell you?

43:16.624 --> 43:17.958
No.

43:18.124 --> 43:19.791
No.

43:24.374 --> 43:25.833
No.

44:13.957 --> 44:16.291
Fuck me.

44:35.707 --> 44:37.332
Do it.

44:38.124 --> 44:40.666
Do it, Patrick. Do it.

44:43.041 --> 44:44.291
Do it.

44:56.666 --> 44:58.249
Hello?

45:00.374 --> 45:01.957
Hello?

45:12.541 --> 45:13.957
Hello? Can you read me?

45:14.124 --> 45:15.874
Oh, God.

45:19.124 --> 45:21.624
Can you read me? Are you out there?

45:25.624 --> 45:27.291
Hello?

45:36.457 --> 45:37.749
Yeah. I read you.

45:37.916 --> 45:39.832
Oh, thank God.

45:40.082 --> 45:44.124
For a minute there, I dreamt
I'd never made contact with someone.

45:44.791 --> 45:46.707
Yeah. Me too.

45:47.124 --> 45:48.957
Well, where are you?

45:51.291 --> 45:53.124
In Harmony.

45:53.791 --> 45:55.291
- It's in the...
- I know it.

45:55.457 --> 45:57.457
It's not so far from where we are.

45:58.166 --> 45:59.874
They're back.

46:01.457 --> 46:03.957
We thought they were all dead,
but they're...

46:05.291 --> 46:07.791
They're back. They infected me.

46:07.957 --> 46:10.124
What? But...

46:10.291 --> 46:12.207
You were bitten? When was it?

46:12.374 --> 46:14.082
This morning.

46:18.166 --> 46:22.249
Too much time has gone by, you'd be
one of them by now. You're not infected.

46:22.416 --> 46:24.249
I'm gonna kill it.

46:26.041 --> 46:28.207
I'm gonna go out there...

46:29.457 --> 46:31.582
and I'm gonna kill that...

46:31.832 --> 46:35.374
- That creature, whatever it is. I'm...
- Patrick.

46:35.541 --> 46:38.624
That creature isn't responsible
for what happened today.

46:38.791 --> 46:41.457
The neighbour could've helped you,
but he didn't.

46:41.791 --> 46:44.916
He's got the girl,
and now you've got nothing.

46:45.624 --> 46:47.291
What are you gonna do about it?

46:51.874 --> 46:53.457
What?

46:55.957 --> 46:57.791
Who are you?

47:14.957 --> 47:16.082
You're a liar.

47:16.249 --> 47:18.624
Last night you said the neighbour
would turn into a monster...

47:18.791 --> 47:21.332
because he got bit. But it's not true.

47:21.499 --> 47:23.416
That's impossible.

47:23.582 --> 47:24.624
That thing...

47:26.249 --> 47:28.249
That thing bit him.

47:38.707 --> 47:40.415
Why'd you break my watch, Lu?

47:40.582 --> 47:42.665
So, you wouldn't know what time it is.

47:42.832 --> 47:45.415
That monster was the same one I saw
the other night...

47:45.582 --> 47:47.624
and you didn't believe me.

47:49.790 --> 47:52.582
Honey, can we call a truce?

47:56.415 --> 47:57.707
What's a truce?

47:57.874 --> 48:01.457
A truce is when you forgive someone
for a little while.

48:03.332 --> 48:06.249
You always liked a second cookie
in the morning.

48:08.457 --> 48:10.874
The second cookie was for doggy.

48:12.624 --> 48:15.040
Honey, please.

48:16.499 --> 48:18.915
What's gonna happen
when you're real old?

48:19.082 --> 48:21.624
Will I have to ask permission
to go out then too?

48:21.790 --> 48:23.790
I'm tired of living my life locked up.

48:23.957 --> 48:27.415
I've never been out of this house.
You never let me do anything.

48:27.582 --> 48:29.624
I wanna go pick new flowers for my mom.

48:29.790 --> 48:32.707
- If you're afraid, I'll go myself.
- Can't go out. Can't go outside.

48:32.874 --> 48:34.457
Those things...

48:34.624 --> 48:38.374
I don't know what they are,
but, honey, the monsters are back.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.999
But they're flowers for Mom.

48:42.665 --> 48:44.915
I bet the neighbour would do it.

50:49.290 --> 50:51.540
Are you there, Patrick?

50:53.957 --> 50:55.832
Answer, Patrick.

50:55.999 --> 50:57.707
Who are you?

50:59.040 --> 51:02.123
Patrick, are you there?

51:03.915 --> 51:04.957
Patrick?

51:08.332 --> 51:09.915
Who the fuck are you?

51:10.082 --> 51:12.582
Patrick, the time is now.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.582
You got your rifle ready last night.

51:15.748 --> 51:18.290
The decision's been made.

51:21.290 --> 51:23.165
I am not a murderer.

51:23.332 --> 51:25.498
I am not going to kill Jack.

51:25.665 --> 51:27.040
Yes, you are.

51:27.207 --> 51:30.415
Don't you dare turn your back on me.

51:31.373 --> 51:35.498
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.

51:40.123 --> 51:42.290
Don't make me hurt you.

51:43.207 --> 51:45.457
You had the balls to let Emma die...

51:45.623 --> 51:49.790
and now you feel bad
for that son of a bitch, you piece of shit.

51:49.957 --> 51:52.207
Candy ass.

51:52.457 --> 51:57.623
You don't even have the balls
to shoot a goddamn radio.

52:02.207 --> 52:04.540
What will happen to the girl?

52:12.957 --> 52:15.498
Lu, there are no flowers left.

52:15.915 --> 52:18.082
Then I won't call a truce.

52:25.832 --> 52:28.082
But I found these.

52:32.707 --> 52:35.790
Even better. Now they won't droop.

52:44.123 --> 52:45.623
Thank you.

53:40.915 --> 53:43.082
Thanks for watching, bunny.

53:45.332 --> 53:47.165
I'll be back soon.

53:47.748 --> 53:49.457
Promise.

54:16.790 --> 54:18.332
Lu?

54:20.207 --> 54:21.873
Lu?

54:36.998 --> 54:38.498
Lu.

55:28.373 --> 55:29.456
No.

55:32.290 --> 55:33.456
No, no.

55:34.165 --> 55:37.040
Wait. Over here. Hey.

56:14.831 --> 56:16.873
Lu, baby?

56:18.623 --> 56:20.456
Oh, honey.

56:22.081 --> 56:23.790
Look at me, baby. Look at me.

57:01.831 --> 57:03.290
Lu?

57:07.623 --> 57:09.123
Lu?

57:13.623 --> 57:14.665
Lu?

57:38.456 --> 57:39.873
Lu?

57:54.915 --> 57:57.248
Where the hell you going
this time of night?

58:09.081 --> 58:13.539
It's the creature that attacked you.

58:16.123 --> 58:18.123
Think there'll be more?

58:18.373 --> 58:19.414
Who are you?

58:19.581 --> 58:21.789
I've been keeping watch with binoculars.

58:21.956 --> 58:24.456
- What are you doing?
- There's no sign of them.

58:25.456 --> 58:29.123
Check this out. Thought the fucker
would bleed out and die.

58:29.289 --> 58:31.331
Tell me where Lu is, Patrick.

58:31.498 --> 58:35.623
Fucking sealed up the wounds
in just a few hours.

58:36.123 --> 58:39.123
We thought they were dying,
but they're evolving.

58:39.289 --> 58:41.623
They adapted to their environment.

58:43.831 --> 58:45.456
Teeth.

58:45.623 --> 58:46.998
Claws.

58:47.164 --> 58:49.248
Hard skin for resisting cold.

58:49.414 --> 58:51.623
Evolution like that
takes millions of years.

58:51.789 --> 58:52.998
It took this thing nine.

58:53.164 --> 58:55.248
- What happened to Lu?
- It's not all bad.

58:55.414 --> 58:59.248
Neither one of us got infected.
The contagious strain is gone.

58:59.414 --> 59:01.914
Gives us a fighting chance, right?

59:03.539 --> 59:04.706
Totally blind.

59:04.873 --> 59:08.539
Locate their prey by sound alone.
Don't know how many are out there.

59:08.706 --> 59:11.456
- We're gonna have to be ready.
- What happened to Lu?

59:12.206 --> 59:15.081
How long before this thing
starves to death?

59:15.248 --> 59:18.748
Couple of weeks, a month.
These fuckers are tougher than the first.

59:18.914 --> 59:20.664
Where's Lu, Patrick?

59:21.914 --> 59:22.956
Daddy?

59:31.164 --> 59:33.914
- How did you...? You okay, Lu?
- I'm sorry.

59:34.081 --> 59:36.289
- It's okay, baby.
- Patrick took care of me.

59:36.456 --> 59:39.123
- It's okay. It's okay, baby.
- I'm fine.

59:39.289 --> 59:42.206
- Are you hurt? Let me look at you.
- I'm... I'm okay.

59:42.373 --> 59:44.373
- It's okay, baby.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

59:46.081 --> 59:48.289
Are you cold? Are you hungry?

59:54.373 --> 59:55.789
Patrick?

59:55.956 --> 59:57.664
Are you there?

59:58.289 --> 59:59.831
Patrick.

01:00:02.414 --> 01:00:04.039
Patrick.

01:00:05.206 --> 01:00:07.623
Listen to me. You...

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.664
Hello?

01:00:29.581 --> 01:00:31.248
Hello?

01:00:31.414 --> 01:00:32.831
Neighbour Patrick?

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.498
Hello?

01:00:37.331 --> 01:00:38.498
Neighbour Patrick?

01:00:38.664 --> 01:00:42.456
- Yes?
- Dad. Hey, he answered. Come on.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:45.498
I wanted to invite you over
for dinner tomorrow night.

01:00:45.664 --> 01:00:47.748
I mean, if you can, of course.

01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:50.623
Can you, Neighbour Patrick?

01:00:52.748 --> 01:00:54.873
Yes, Lu. That...

01:00:55.039 --> 01:00:57.623
I would like that very much.

01:00:58.373 --> 01:01:00.498
What time should I come?

01:01:01.164 --> 01:01:03.289
How about after my cartoon?

01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:08.581
Okay, Lu. I will... I will see you then.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.914
I promise. Okay.

01:01:11.081 --> 01:01:12.289
Bye, Neighbour Patrick.

01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:37.622
Christ.

01:01:58.122 --> 01:02:00.581
I didn't know what to bring, so...

01:02:04.622 --> 01:02:06.956
You don't drink anymore, do you?

01:02:09.497 --> 01:02:11.164
Me either.

01:02:18.706 --> 01:02:20.706
Lu, come on down.

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:32.539
This is yours.

01:02:32.706 --> 01:02:34.122
That's a...

01:02:34.289 --> 01:02:37.706
- It's a gift for Lu.
- I figured.

01:02:37.956 --> 01:02:41.247
What I mean is,
I don't play with these things.

01:02:43.622 --> 01:02:45.622
Hi, Neighbour Pat...

01:02:49.122 --> 01:02:50.164
Neighbour?

01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:06.456
- Aren't those fancy.
- I know.

01:03:06.622 --> 01:03:09.997
They're like my mom's,
but without the holes.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:13.956
It's for your birthday.

01:03:14.539 --> 01:03:16.456
Look, Dad. It's the one I wanted.

01:03:16.622 --> 01:03:19.664
I thought you were getting too old
to play with dolls.

01:03:24.872 --> 01:03:27.414
How'd you know it was the dolly
I liked the best?

01:03:27.581 --> 01:03:29.039
I just figured.

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:31.706
I sure liked them when I was a kid.

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:34.372
Okay. So be honest.

01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:36.872
What else did you like
when you were a kid?

01:03:39.747 --> 01:03:41.581
Lots of stuff.

01:03:41.872 --> 01:03:43.706
Toy soldiers.

01:03:44.206 --> 01:03:46.206
I had a whole bucket of them.

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:51.247
And then robots like Mazinger.

01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:55.622
But more than anything,
playing hockey with my buddies.

01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:57.956
You were a lucky duck.

01:03:58.122 --> 01:04:00.831
All I get to play with is my dolls.

01:04:02.997 --> 01:04:05.622
There's gotta be a kid or two
out there somewhere.

01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:10.039
- There's gotta be someone somewhere.
- My dad says there's not any.

01:04:15.622 --> 01:04:18.081
Are you scared of the monsters?

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.831
Of course he's scared of the monsters.

01:04:23.122 --> 01:04:25.664
That's why he protects himself.

01:04:26.914 --> 01:04:30.289
And we'll be safe
as long as we protect ourselves.

01:04:30.456 --> 01:04:32.914
Yeah, but he's braver.

01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:39.081
Now that you two are friends, you can go
hunt animals with my dad, right?

01:04:39.247 --> 01:04:41.206
So we can have real food more often.

01:04:41.372 --> 01:04:44.122
I think that's a good idea.

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:45.747
I can help your dad hunt...

01:04:45.914 --> 01:04:48.122
and he can help me go get ammunition...

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:51.622
and other supplies in the store.
What do you think?

01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:54.664
I think you don't need my dad's help
to go into town.

01:04:59.247 --> 01:05:02.580
You, when you were a kid,
did you know how to add and subtract?

01:05:02.747 --> 01:05:07.914
Well, not much.
I tell you what, not much now neither.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.580
Well, I do. My dad taught me.

01:05:10.747 --> 01:05:13.039
Watch. Three plus two is five.

01:05:13.205 --> 01:05:14.789
Six plus one is seven.

01:05:14.955 --> 01:05:17.455
Eight plus four is...?
Come on. It's easy.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.205
No counting on your fingers.

01:05:19.372 --> 01:05:20.872
That's cheating.

01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:23.789
It's 12, Neighbour Patrick, 12.

01:05:23.955 --> 01:05:27.289
I'm glad to know
your dad is good for something.

01:05:29.664 --> 01:05:32.789
What about geography?
Did you know about geography?

01:05:33.205 --> 01:05:35.997
Let's see. In what country
is the Great Wall of China?

01:05:36.164 --> 01:05:37.997
Oh, gosh.

01:05:38.747 --> 01:05:41.539
- Mexico.
- Nope. China.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:43.080
Do you know what language they speak?

01:05:43.247 --> 01:05:44.455
Chinese.

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.289
Very good.

01:05:46.455 --> 01:05:49.122
- Do you know what the population is?
- Right now?

01:05:56.289 --> 01:05:57.789
What is it?

01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:59.830
What's so funny?

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:01.830
Why are you laughing?

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:04.164
Oh, shit.

01:06:04.664 --> 01:06:08.164
Dad, he said a swear word.
If you swear, people think badly of you.

01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:10.539
- I know. I know.
- Right, Dad?

01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:12.205
- I know.
- They will.

01:06:12.372 --> 01:06:14.622
It's important
what people think about us.

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:19.039
Yeah. Well, especially the Chinese.
Goddamn Chine...

01:06:20.705 --> 01:06:24.039
And then E.T.'s heart
started to beat again.

01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:30.080
And the plant
that looked like it was dead...

01:06:30.247 --> 01:06:32.455
came back to life.

01:06:33.914 --> 01:06:36.247
That's a nice story.

01:06:38.497 --> 01:06:41.955
Meanwhile, Elliott and his friends...

01:06:42.122 --> 01:06:44.580
planned E.T.'s rescue.

01:06:50.122 --> 01:06:52.455
And she's out like a light.

01:06:54.664 --> 01:06:57.580
- Should I take her up?
- I'll handle it.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:06.289
Another night where she goes to sleep
without brushing her teeth.

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:08.455
Not a tragedy.

01:07:09.164 --> 01:07:11.914
I don't like it when she disobeys.

01:07:13.289 --> 01:07:16.372
It's normal. I'm sure you were
rebellious at her age too.

01:07:16.539 --> 01:07:19.205
It'd be normal
if we were living in a normal world.

01:07:19.372 --> 01:07:21.455
Disobeying is dangerous here.

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:23.747
She's a lot like her mother.

01:07:24.455 --> 01:07:26.914
She has nothing of her father in her.

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.372
I'm sorry about your dog, Patrick.

01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:45.455
- I don't know what came over me.
- It's all right.

01:07:46.289 --> 01:07:51.122
I know what it's like
to have weird things come over you.

01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:54.455
These things are back.

01:07:57.872 --> 01:08:02.372
I haven't forgotten what happened
or what you did.

01:08:03.414 --> 01:08:05.872
But I can't do this alone. Not with Lu.

01:08:06.039 --> 01:08:07.872
You can count on me.

01:08:08.497 --> 01:08:10.205
For anything.

01:08:11.539 --> 01:08:14.122
That truck we were
gonna take back before Emma...

01:08:16.455 --> 01:08:18.288
I think I can get it working.

01:08:20.538 --> 01:08:21.913
What?

01:08:22.913 --> 01:08:26.662
- We're not going anywhere.
- What, are you planning...

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:29.955
on staying here
and waiting for more to come?

01:08:32.455 --> 01:08:34.372
What makes you think more are coming?

01:08:34.537 --> 01:08:36.287
The fuck are you saying?

01:08:36.455 --> 01:08:37.955
They're coming.

01:08:38.122 --> 01:08:41.912
If it's not today, it'll be tomorrow
or next week, but they're back.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.372
Shit. You're worried
about her brushing her teeth...

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.622
instead of her living her life
cooped up in this prison.

01:08:48.787 --> 01:08:50.497
There is no future here, Jack.

01:08:50.662 --> 01:08:53.622
You lower your voice,
or you will wake her up.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.955
We are safe here.

01:08:57.955 --> 01:09:00.787
We can protect ourselves here.

01:09:01.162 --> 01:09:03.287
We have no idea
what's on the other side.

01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:06.287
That's the problem, Jack.
We don't know shit.

01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:09.872
You have been so hell-bent
on surviving...

01:09:10.037 --> 01:09:13.122
that you have forgotten how to live.

01:09:13.287 --> 01:09:16.872
Oh, if you're so damn sure,
why the hell haven't you left already?

01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:28.830
This dinner was a bad idea.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.955
This was her thing.

01:09:37.497 --> 01:09:39.080
Go.

01:09:39.997 --> 01:09:42.787
I'm grateful for how you raised her.

01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:46.247
- Emma would also...
- No. No.

01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:47.912
Don't you talk about Emma.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.122
Not in this house.

01:09:50.912 --> 01:09:52.455
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.247 --> 01:09:57.038
What are you actually sorry about?

01:09:59.997 --> 01:10:01.830
Just go.

01:10:23.622 --> 01:10:25.455
What did you do?

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:26.872
Emma's...

01:10:28.997 --> 01:10:31.038
Do you know what you've done?

01:10:31.205 --> 01:10:34.372
The infected are all gone.
They're not...

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.580
Drunk son of a bitch.

01:10:36.747 --> 01:10:39.080
Fuck off.

01:10:40.705 --> 01:10:43.122
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:46.538
Where is she?

01:10:47.622 --> 01:10:49.872
- What?
- Emma. Where is she?

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.413
You fucking killed her.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.955
Fuck.

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.163
Fuck you.

01:11:08.705 --> 01:11:11.038
You're no longer her father.

01:11:42.038 --> 01:11:43.413
Dad.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:44.913
What?

01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:48.622
Lu, what is it? What?

01:11:51.122 --> 01:11:53.622
Baby, you were having a bad dream.

01:11:54.497 --> 01:11:56.163
Hey. It's okay.

01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:58.830
The monsters can't hurt you anymore.

01:12:00.371 --> 01:12:01.413
I...

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.121
I didn't dream about the monster.

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:08.163
You died, and I was left here all alone.

01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:10.121
I don't wanna be alone, Daddy.

01:12:10.288 --> 01:12:12.788
- I thought I was big, but I'm not.
- It's okay.

01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:15.830
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.871
You got room for two more?

01:13:03.205 --> 01:13:05.371
Daddy. Dad.

01:13:07.955 --> 01:13:09.996
Dad, do you see this?

01:13:10.955 --> 01:13:15.163
Look, Neighbour Patrick. Look.
Look at all those trees. See this?

01:13:15.955 --> 01:13:18.121
Come on. Look.

01:13:39.955 --> 01:13:41.955
Lu, stay close.

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:48.038
Lu needs a father, not a drunk.

01:13:48.205 --> 01:13:50.913
You... You and Jack...

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.705
Patrick.

01:14:30.288 --> 01:14:33.121
Is this where you got the dolls from TV?

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:36.288
There's only one way to find out.

01:15:01.705 --> 01:15:03.871
Jack, give me a hand.

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:23.746
Lu?

01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:31.121
Lu?

01:15:52.913 --> 01:15:55.246
Lu, wait for me.

01:16:00.746 --> 01:16:02.246
Dad.

01:16:03.038 --> 01:16:05.288
I think there's something out there.

01:16:36.079 --> 01:16:37.913
Are you okay?

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:51.038
Hey.

01:16:52.329 --> 01:16:54.663
No. No. No.

01:16:54.829 --> 01:16:56.954
Get in the truck. Get in the truck.

01:16:57.288 --> 01:16:58.788
It's okay.

01:17:00.454 --> 01:17:02.621
Calm the fuck down. It's okay.

01:17:02.788 --> 01:17:05.329
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:08.121
She's in shock.

01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:25.454
Her clothes are soaking wet.

01:17:35.829 --> 01:17:37.163
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:17:37.329 --> 01:17:38.788
Come on.

01:17:40.913 --> 01:17:43.038
Sweetie, go downstairs.

01:17:43.663 --> 01:17:47.329
- But I don't wanna be alone.
- Go downstairs now. Do not disobey me.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.954
Go.

01:18:23.913 --> 01:18:26.246
Is that woman gonna die?

01:18:27.496 --> 01:18:28.538
No.

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:33.371
No, she just got very cold,
and that made her sick.

01:18:33.538 --> 01:18:34.954
She's gonna be okay.

01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:41.204
- So there are other people in the world?
- Yeah. It looks that way.

01:18:41.954 --> 01:18:43.788
Kids too?

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:46.038
I don't know.

01:18:47.163 --> 01:18:50.954
We could ask her if she gets better.

01:18:51.121 --> 01:18:53.704
Now, that sounds like a good idea.

01:19:00.704 --> 01:19:03.037
Did you like my mom too?

01:19:08.996 --> 01:19:11.162
It's just
you have so many pictures of her...

01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:12.787
up in your room.

01:19:13.037 --> 01:19:14.954
We don't even have that many at home.

01:19:20.787 --> 01:19:23.871
I think that's why you and my daddy
keep fighting.

01:19:25.037 --> 01:19:26.954
It is, isn't it?

01:19:30.371 --> 01:19:31.996
You are a...

01:19:32.662 --> 01:19:35.079
A very clever girl.

01:19:41.412 --> 01:19:43.746
And when my mom chose my dad...

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:46.371
I bet you were pretty sad.

01:19:50.454 --> 01:19:53.121
But weren't there
other pretty girls for you?

01:19:56.037 --> 01:19:58.371
None as pretty as your mother.

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:10.204
She's stabilised...

01:20:10.371 --> 01:20:12.787
but she is running a fever.

01:20:14.412 --> 01:20:15.871
It's hot.

01:20:16.037 --> 01:20:18.704
I'm gonna go out and check the fence.

01:20:23.621 --> 01:20:25.787
You have to do what I tell you.

01:20:27.454 --> 01:20:28.871
Please.

01:20:59.787 --> 01:21:00.996
She was delirious.

01:21:01.162 --> 01:21:03.496
Said dozens of creatures attacked them.

01:21:05.954 --> 01:21:07.787
See anything?

01:21:09.287 --> 01:21:11.537
I hadn't noticed that for so long.

01:21:11.704 --> 01:21:13.037
What?

01:21:47.579 --> 01:21:49.246
It's okay.

01:21:55.954 --> 01:21:59.162
We were shut up in our house...

01:21:59.329 --> 01:22:02.996
for over a year.

01:22:03.621 --> 01:22:09.954
My parents, my brothers and I,
we just stayed there...

01:22:10.121 --> 01:22:13.496
because of what we heard on the radio
before the blackout.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.496
Then what happened?

01:22:18.579 --> 01:22:20.037
Then...

01:22:20.579 --> 01:22:25.537
Then we left our house
and headed north...

01:22:25.704 --> 01:22:30.454
in just abandoned cars
we found along the way.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.079
And...

01:22:32.454 --> 01:22:35.162
living in all kinds of places.

01:22:36.829 --> 01:22:40.787
And we found little cells of survivors.

01:22:40.954 --> 01:22:42.662
People like you all.

01:22:42.829 --> 01:22:47.412
And I met a guy
in one of these groups...

01:22:47.579 --> 01:22:51.537
and I got pregnant.

01:22:53.995 --> 01:22:58.120
Although, he never had
the chance to know it.

01:23:00.495 --> 01:23:01.995
And...

01:23:05.537 --> 01:23:08.829
about a few weeks ago, we...

01:23:09.287 --> 01:23:11.620
We hooked up
with about a dozen others...

01:23:11.787 --> 01:23:13.995
and created a three-car convoy.

01:23:15.704 --> 01:23:18.204
We heard a radio broadcast
out of this valley...

01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:23.829
and thought
that maybe things weren't so bad here.

01:23:27.204 --> 01:23:29.912
Why did you leave your house?

01:23:34.912 --> 01:23:36.912
Because...

01:23:38.162 --> 01:23:40.620
that was no longer living.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:45.620
I mean, we're human beings.

01:23:48.162 --> 01:23:50.662
What about you?
How long have you been here?

01:23:53.704 --> 01:23:55.954
Do you know how to braid?

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.287
Lu.

01:23:57.454 --> 01:23:58.954
Yeah.

01:24:09.995 --> 01:24:12.120
I'd like to go to China.

01:24:12.537 --> 01:24:14.954
It's really, really big.

01:24:15.454 --> 01:24:16.912
Well...

01:24:17.454 --> 01:24:19.870
I'd like to go to China too.

01:24:21.204 --> 01:24:25.204
Yeah. They say
it's a very beautiful place.

01:24:28.287 --> 01:24:30.037
What is it?

01:24:33.245 --> 01:24:36.037
Is there really a baby in there?

01:24:38.454 --> 01:24:39.954
Yeah.

01:24:40.454 --> 01:24:42.037
There is.

01:24:42.454 --> 01:24:43.870
And...

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.245
well, you know, when...

01:24:46.412 --> 01:24:50.370
When he's born,
you'll have to help take care of him.

01:24:50.787 --> 01:24:52.454
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:57.287
You'll be able to play together
and be friends.

01:24:58.954 --> 01:25:00.954
They're here. They're here.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.537
- No. No, we captured one. It's harmless.
- What?

01:25:04.704 --> 01:25:07.787
Yeah. It's harmless. I'm telling you.
Completely.

01:25:22.162 --> 01:25:23.537
Hey.

01:25:38.287 --> 01:25:41.412
That's how they fucking call
to each other.

01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:07.578
What the hell is going on?

01:26:07.787 --> 01:26:10.120
Now, we're all gonna die.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.578
No one is gonna die.

01:27:04.745 --> 01:27:06.578
Hey, you.

01:27:08.245 --> 01:27:12.703
- That's a nice doll. What's his name?
- Lu doesn't deserve this.

01:27:14.078 --> 01:27:15.745
I call him Randy.

01:27:15.912 --> 01:27:17.370
Look.

01:27:18.453 --> 01:27:20.287
I'm sorry.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.412
Sorry for everything that's happened.

01:27:25.995 --> 01:27:28.828
It's not my forgiveness you need.

01:27:56.787 --> 01:27:57.953
What...?

01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:39.620
Lu, sweetie, for once in your life,
just obey Daddy.

01:28:40.037 --> 01:28:42.287
I need you to go downstairs.

01:28:42.787 --> 01:28:45.120
Listen to me. Lu, listen to me.

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:48.287
Daddy needs to help
get the monsters out of the house.

01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:50.870
I can't do that
if I don't know you're safe.

01:28:51.037 --> 01:28:53.787
The windows, they're small,
monsters cannot get in.

01:28:53.953 --> 01:28:55.453
Listen, they won't get in.

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:58.328
- Gonna shut the door, walk downstairs.
- Daddy.

01:28:58.703 --> 01:29:02.120
And no matter what happens,
you don't make a sound. All right?

01:29:03.703 --> 01:29:06.620
You understand?
That's right, sweetheart. That's right.

01:29:06.787 --> 01:29:10.037
That way they can't hear you. Okay.
So, you just...

01:29:10.203 --> 01:29:14.870
And when this is all over,
Daddy is gonna open the door. Okay?

01:29:15.037 --> 01:29:16.870
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

01:29:17.037 --> 01:29:18.495
No.

01:34:13.286 --> 01:34:14.786
Patrick.

01:34:17.786 --> 01:34:20.286
I think they're inside the walls.

01:35:09.119 --> 01:35:10.536
Lu? Honey, are you there?

01:35:11.286 --> 01:35:12.786
Lu?

01:36:16.786 --> 01:36:18.411
Drop dead.

01:37:02.786 --> 01:37:04.286
Lu.

01:37:10.369 --> 01:37:12.536
I don't like the basement.

01:37:13.952 --> 01:37:16.744
There's a monster,
and he tried to hurt me.

01:37:17.161 --> 01:37:18.452
That's why I need you...

01:37:18.619 --> 01:37:20.661
- to stay right here.
- No.

01:37:20.827 --> 01:37:22.286
Everybody can see each other right here.

01:37:22.452 --> 01:37:23.911
Okay? You'll be safe here.

01:37:24.077 --> 01:37:25.286
Where's my dad?

01:37:25.452 --> 01:37:26.786
Your dad...

01:37:26.952 --> 01:37:30.327
Your dad is upstairs,
and he's gonna be down any minute.

01:37:30.494 --> 01:37:33.202
I need you to stay here.
Stay away from the doors...

01:37:33.369 --> 01:37:36.411
and the windows,
and everything's gonna be okay.

01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:48.494
Hello? Do you read me?

01:37:49.036 --> 01:37:54.369
We're broadcasting from Spring Falls.
This is not a pre-recorded message.

01:38:32.244 --> 01:38:34.952
Lu? Lu, what are you doing here?
Are you hurt?

01:38:35.119 --> 01:38:37.452
- Dad. Dad.
- Now stay here. Don't move.

01:38:56.119 --> 01:38:59.536
- More fuel?
- Yeah, but the generator's out too far.

01:39:11.744 --> 01:39:12.786
More ammo?

01:39:17.661 --> 01:39:19.327
Not enough.

01:39:36.161 --> 01:39:37.619
Shit.

01:39:38.786 --> 01:39:40.952
Give me some fucking light.

01:39:41.119 --> 01:39:42.619
Right here.

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:44.619
Hurry.

01:40:18.952 --> 01:40:21.119
I won't let them hurt her.

01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:25.785
- Dad.
- It's okay, baby.

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:30.369
Baby, listen to me. I want you
to close your eyes and think of Mom.

01:40:30.535 --> 01:40:32.410
- Dad.
- Close your eyes, baby.

01:40:32.577 --> 01:40:35.785
Close your eyes and think of Mom.
And when you see her...

01:40:35.952 --> 01:40:37.952
- the monsters will be gone.
- Dad.

01:40:38.119 --> 01:40:41.660
And when you see her,
the monsters are gone.

01:40:43.452 --> 01:40:46.619
And when you see her,
the monsters are gone.

01:40:46.785 --> 01:40:50.952
No, Dad. They said you have
to shoot them in the head to kill them.

01:40:51.452 --> 01:40:53.035
Who?

01:40:54.369 --> 01:40:55.535
The woman on the radio.

01:40:55.702 --> 01:40:57.952
They said it
before everything turned off.

01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.369
- Where's Spring Falls?
- Some 50 miles from here.

01:41:01.535 --> 01:41:05.535
- They said we have to go there.
- Yeah. That's right. We heard that too.

01:41:12.202 --> 01:41:13.535
No.

01:41:20.452 --> 01:41:22.285
It's too far. We'll never make it.

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:26.119
I'm gonna draw them away from the house.

01:41:26.285 --> 01:41:29.285
And when it's clear,
you get to the truck...

01:41:29.452 --> 01:41:32.452
but don't start it.
Not until I give you the signal.

01:41:41.952 --> 01:41:43.619
What's going on?

01:41:43.785 --> 01:41:45.785
He's drawing them away from the house.

01:42:03.244 --> 01:42:05.202
Lu, listen to me.

01:42:06.244 --> 01:42:08.702
There's something I need to tell you.

01:42:12.119 --> 01:42:14.202
When this is all over...

01:42:14.827 --> 01:42:16.494
no matter what...

01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:21.744
No matter what, always brush your teeth
before bedtime. Okay?

01:42:42.619 --> 01:42:45.952
And now we're gonna kick
these monsters out of here, princess.

01:43:00.285 --> 01:43:01.702
Right here.

01:43:01.869 --> 01:43:03.785
I'm right here. Come on.

01:43:03.952 --> 01:43:05.535
Come on.

01:43:05.869 --> 01:43:08.869
Come on. I'm right here. Come on.

01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:11.910
Right here. I'm right here.

01:43:12.077 --> 01:43:14.952
Come on. Come on.

01:43:22.119 --> 01:43:23.702
Right here.

01:43:24.743 --> 01:43:26.743
Right here. Come on.

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:30.202
That's right, fuckers. Come on.

01:43:35.285 --> 01:43:37.118
Come on.

01:43:40.785 --> 01:43:42.827
All right. All right, now.

01:43:42.993 --> 01:43:44.660
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

01:43:57.077 --> 01:43:59.577
I know you're all cosy inside.

01:43:59.743 --> 01:44:01.702
But I really...

01:44:02.243 --> 01:44:06.577
We really wanna meet you, little girl,
so don't get too comfortable in there.

01:44:06.743 --> 01:44:09.118
Hey, don't say that.

01:44:09.285 --> 01:44:11.452
I'm not talking to you.

01:44:14.535 --> 01:44:16.202
Now, you gotta come out soon.

01:44:16.827 --> 01:44:18.660
And I hope, for your sake...

01:44:18.827 --> 01:44:20.660
that you look like your mother.

01:44:20.827 --> 01:44:26.327
Because right now,
there is nothing more beautiful.

01:45:19.035 --> 01:45:20.327
Lu.

01:45:22.285 --> 01:45:23.785
Look.

01:45:57.535 --> 01:45:58.868
Look, Dad.

01:45:59.035 --> 01:46:01.368
I can see China.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.785
Now what?
