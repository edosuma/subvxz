03:01.957 --> 03:03.925
Well, it is fixed?

03:04.026 --> 03:06.393
No, it's not fixed.

03:06.494 --> 03:07.895
The nut is stripped.

03:07.996 --> 03:10.764
I need water for to make
the Cream of Wheat.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.767

03:28.348 --> 03:31.050
Could you please get him
to stop crying?

03:31.151 --> 03:32.684
He is hungry.

03:32.786 --> 03:35.654
Well, then, go in the bathroom
and use the water from in there.

03:35.756 --> 03:38.624
The bathroom is for bathing,
the kitchen is for cooking.

03:38.725 --> 03:40.860
Is that really
a meaningful distinction?

03:40.961 --> 03:43.494
When you will fix the pipe?

I live in the house,

03:48.433 --> 03:51.669
for months and months,
and nothing fits together.

03:54.106 --> 03:55.774
I have to get ready for work.

03:55.875 --> 03:59.342
The flowers, yes?

03:59.443 --> 04:02.345
The big important job
for Mr. O'Banion.

04:02.446 --> 04:03.847
Is that what you think I do?

04:03.948 --> 04:07.317
Oh, yeah. You're the strongman
who gets the money.

04:07.418 --> 04:10.087
Mr. O'Banion
gives $1,000

04:10.188 --> 04:12.656

the people's head.

04:17.226 --> 04:18.459
What if he did?

04:18.560 --> 04:21.630

Nucky: <i>Have you ever considered
it was Purnsley acting alone?</i>

04:50.325 --> 04:52.559
It was Narcisse.
I know it.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.228
That's what the girl says?

04:55.797 --> 04:57.198
I'm asking if you can prove it.

04:57.299 --> 04:59.066
This ain't no
court of law, Nucky.

04:59.167 --> 05:02.069
That doesn't change the fact that you're
asking me to impose a death sentence.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.204
I wasn't askin'.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.505
Let's get something
straight here.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.308
You move against Narcisse,

05:08.408 --> 05:10.143
you risk losing
everything you have.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.911
He ain't comin' after
what's yours.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.579
That's because
I mind my business.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.748
- What that mean?
- <i>Look.</i>

05:15.850 --> 05:19.585
- Let me get him in here, sit
him down... - What that mean?

05:19.686 --> 05:22.788
It means when I'm conducting
business, I mind it.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.857
It and only it.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.192
Not some piece of ass
with a sugary voice,

05:27.293 --> 05:30.596
not my pride, my business.

05:39.171 --> 05:41.406
Heard a lot of "we" last year.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.810
When you was in trouble.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.412
Now it just you.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.749
How do you like
your fucking nightclub,

05:50.850 --> 05:52.349
on the boardwalk?

05:53.852 --> 05:56.754
<i>You have any idea the bullshit
I had to put up with?</i>

05:56.855 --> 06:00.223
The strings I had to pull, the palms
I had to grease to make this happen?

06:00.324 --> 06:04.194
Already said thank you
by saving your ass.

06:04.295 --> 06:07.063
And this place evens the score.

06:13.871 --> 06:15.872
(sighs)

06:15.972 --> 06:19.475
You've got a family, Chalky.
Children.

06:19.576 --> 06:22.077
A wife who loves you, a
daughter about to be married.

06:22.178 --> 06:24.746
What we gonna do
about Narcisse?

06:26.382 --> 06:29.718
Let me talk to him,
feel him out

06:29.819 --> 06:32.053
before you do anything.

06:35.425 --> 06:37.726
I'll give you
a minute for that.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.327
Just.

06:42.798 --> 06:46.734
(door opens, closes)

06:50.705 --> 06:52.473
Of course they were fairies.

06:52.574 --> 06:54.141
They picked that kid up,

06:54.242 --> 06:56.242
and when he wouldn't
bend over, that was that.

06:56.343 --> 06:58.745
- Leopold, maybe, not the other one.
- Eh.

06:58.846 --> 07:01.614
- How about the ransom note?
- Look, they're sheenies.

07:01.715 --> 07:03.556
They're not gonna do anything
without a payday.

07:04.752 --> 07:06.152
1,200.

07:06.253 --> 07:08.187
Take the truck, drop
that hooch by Paulson's.

07:09.389 --> 07:10.790
What's wrong with Tarzan here?

07:10.891 --> 07:12.658
I got a rush job
on this wreath.

07:25.271 --> 07:26.972
That truck.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.175
Sometimes I wonder
if it's bad hoodoo.

07:31.276 --> 07:35.145
- Beg pardon?
- The one Stu was in the day we found him.

07:36.147 --> 07:37.648
Oh, yes.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.619
23 shots they hit him with.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.220
Fuckin' believe that?

07:43.321 --> 07:45.689
That was unfortunate.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.323
Unfortunate?

07:47.424 --> 07:48.992
Guy had a wife, a kid.

07:49.093 --> 07:52.195
Well, maybe he didn't
have a kid, but still.

07:52.296 --> 07:54.330
Fuckin' massacre.

07:54.431 --> 07:56.199
(groans)

07:56.300 --> 07:58.401
I'm taking the children
to see the new Buster Keaton.

07:58.503 --> 08:00.936
That was the day you
disappeared with the Capones.

08:01.037 --> 08:04.139
- What?
- The day Stuey got killed.

08:06.009 --> 08:08.477
I... I don't know
anything about that, sir.

08:09.980 --> 08:11.413
Guilty conscience, Mueller?

08:11.515 --> 08:12.948
Sir?

08:13.950 --> 08:16.183
I didn't say you did.

08:16.284 --> 08:18.019
I was just stating
a simple fact.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.490
Your tone, it can be
quite accusatory sometimes.

08:22.591 --> 08:25.393

09:11.537 --> 09:14.205
The sun is all I need
right now.

09:18.243 --> 09:21.211
My first kiss was
under this boardwalk.

09:21.312 --> 09:22.947
Should I be jealous?

09:23.048 --> 09:25.683
He was a freckle-faced boy
from Philadelphia

09:25.784 --> 09:28.619
on holiday with his parents.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.188
I sold him three Luckys
for a nickel,

09:31.289 --> 09:34.324
and he smoked them all before
he had the nerve to lean in.

09:34.425 --> 09:36.258
(chuckles)

09:36.359 --> 09:39.896
We carved our names
somewhere under here.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.999
You never came back to look?

09:43.100 --> 09:45.501
- It was a long time ago.
- At least tell me his name.

09:45.603 --> 09:47.937
I'll cross it out and
chisel mine in its place.

09:50.140 --> 09:52.975
His name was James.

09:53.076 --> 09:55.844
- You're blushing.
- Am I?

09:55.945 --> 09:57.613
Maybe it's the sun.

09:59.749 --> 10:02.884
We were supposed to meet
the night before he left,

10:02.986 --> 10:05.153
in our secret spot.

10:05.254 --> 10:06.722
What happened?

10:06.823 --> 10:10.658
The next day was
the Opening of the Sea.

10:10.759 --> 10:13.928
It was a silly ceremony
for tourists.

10:14.029 --> 10:16.631
I pushed my way
to the front of the crowd,

10:16.732 --> 10:20.635
and I was chosen as one
of King Neptune's Consorts.

10:20.736 --> 10:22.903
I can just see you doing that.

10:23.005 --> 10:25.471
The sheriff approached me.

10:25.572 --> 10:28.141
Thought for sure
I had done something wrong.

10:28.242 --> 10:29.943
Didn't know what.

10:30.044 --> 10:32.078
So he took you to jail?

10:32.179 --> 10:34.713
He took me to a man.

10:36.683 --> 10:39.317
The most powerful man
in the city.

10:39.418 --> 10:41.186
Oh, this is quite the yarn.

10:41.287 --> 10:42.788
Except it's true.

10:44.991 --> 10:47.826
The Commodore, they called him.

10:51.664 --> 10:54.132
He ravaged me that night.

10:59.038 --> 11:03.908
It was six weeks
before my 13th birthday.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.878
,, Gillian, I'm sorry.

11:07.979 --> 11:09.479
If you'd rather not say...

11:09.580 --> 11:11.682
I want you to know.

11:13.818 --> 11:16.887
Nine months later,
I gave birth.

11:18.122 --> 11:20.223
I named the baby James,

11:20.324 --> 11:23.759
the last pure thing
I could remember.

11:26.863 --> 11:28.564
He and I...

11:31.134 --> 11:33.268
I don't know how I can say it.

11:33.369 --> 11:35.637
Just let the words out.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.773
We lived for each other.

11:41.443 --> 11:43.344
A child and a child.

11:43.445 --> 11:44.979
Where is he now?

11:45.081 --> 11:48.149
He enlisted, fought in France.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.318
Very bravely.

11:52.287 --> 11:54.188
Didn't make it back?

11:55.924 --> 11:57.424
He came back.

12:00.729 --> 12:04.331
He struggled to find his place.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.272
He overdosed on heroin...

12:13.373 --> 12:15.307
(sniffles)

12:22.315 --> 12:23.850
That's how
...in my you found him?

12:31.157 --> 12:34.425
I think I will take
that Eskimo Pie after all.

12:47.739 --> 12:49.606
<i>(train rattling)</i>

12:49.707 --> 12:52.209
Has this ever been used?

12:53.444 --> 12:56.947
It is ceremonial,
as far as I know,

12:57.048 --> 13:00.350
but there is a first time
for everything, Mr. Madden.

13:00.451 --> 13:03.453
(chuckling)
Glad you're open-minded.

13:05.189 --> 13:08.625
I spoke to Rothstein.
He can't help you.

13:08.726 --> 13:10.294
Is my money not good?

13:10.395 --> 13:13.163
He's bust, out of
the heroin business.

13:13.264 --> 13:14.764
Masseria squeezed him out.

13:14.864 --> 13:18.601
I was of the understanding that they
had been partners in this endeavor.

13:18.702 --> 13:22.638
Even Lewis and Clark went their
separate ways eventually.

13:25.342 --> 13:26.975
He's your friend
as well, is he not?

13:27.076 --> 13:28.477
Masseria?
Sure.

13:28.578 --> 13:31.946
<i>But he ain't as comfortable</i>

13:32.047 --> 13:35.082
selling to the darker types
like Rothstein was.

13:37.152 --> 13:40.355
The Jew, like the Libyan,
must remain pliable

13:40.456 --> 13:43.057
if he is to survive.

13:43.158 --> 13:47.761
I should like to meet with
Mr. Masseria nonetheless.

13:48.864 --> 13:51.165
You come to the Cotton Club.

13:51.266 --> 13:54.235
<i>We'll see what's what.</i>

13:58.006 --> 14:01.008
<i>(dog barking)</i>

14:14.956 --> 14:17.523
Whoa.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.461
(sniffles) That for me?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.665
It's, uh...

14:26.766 --> 14:28.334
for a Mr. Dob.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.069
Dob.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.571
Dean O'Banion.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.138
(chuckles, sniffles)

14:34.240 --> 14:35.740
Take a seat.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.144
- I don't have time to...
- Sit your ass down.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.387
Tell us everything
you know about O'Banion.

14:49.488 --> 14:52.089
- His whole routine.
- When he wakes up, where he takes his meals.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.524
How many times he takes a shit.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.194
I'm not privy to his per...

14:57.295 --> 15:01.164
We asked you what you
know, not what you don't.

15:04.168 --> 15:07.436
Hit me again, you'll regret it.

15:09.373 --> 15:11.807
You hear that?

15:11.909 --> 15:13.142
Cut the mouthy shit.

15:13.243 --> 15:14.804
I didn't come here
to be smacked around.

15:14.811 --> 15:17.846
Who the fuck you think you are?

15:17.948 --> 15:21.117
The man who stood beside your
brother at Western Electric.

15:21.218 --> 15:22.984
And you're still breathin'.

15:23.085 --> 15:25.453
- So are you.
- I'll cave in his fuckin' face.

15:25.554 --> 15:28.890
Then you won't find out
the best way to kill O'Banion.

15:28.991 --> 15:31.226
That's what you want, isn't it?

15:33.362 --> 15:35.596
That's for me to decide.

15:35.697 --> 15:38.065
Frank was against it.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.967
Frank's gone,

15:40.068 --> 15:42.436
and that mick's still here.

15:42.537 --> 15:45.406
And I don't fuckin' trust you.

15:48.209 --> 15:50.110
$1,000.

15:50.211 --> 15:51.812
I clear that seven days a week.

15:51.913 --> 15:54.214
- Not you, me.
- Ralph: For what?

15:54.316 --> 15:57.751
For going into work tomorrow and
blowing O'Banion's head off.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.054
Why would I let you do that?

16:03.157 --> 16:05.759
Because he thinks I'm a coward.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.761
Ain't you?

16:09.764 --> 16:11.497
Ask Frank.

16:19.405 --> 16:21.807
Maybelle:
<i>That's 161 people.</i>

16:21.908 --> 16:24.209
Odd numbers are bad luck.

16:24.310 --> 16:27.278
Should we trim the invitations?

16:28.614 --> 16:31.449
These got an edge on 'em now.

16:31.550 --> 16:33.384
You didn't have to bother.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.555
You want everything
spic and span.

16:37.656 --> 16:40.191
I'm sure the Crawfords
will appreciate it.

16:42.194 --> 16:45.496
Is there anything you
want me to say to them?

16:45.597 --> 16:47.598
About what?

16:47.699 --> 16:49.633
Your appearance.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.737
He was moving all of
that lumber in the shed

16:53.838 --> 16:55.238
and the shelf broke.

16:55.339 --> 16:57.173
That's right.

16:57.274 --> 16:59.074
Whatever you say.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.711
What you got there, baby girl?

17:01.812 --> 17:03.646
The guest list.

17:03.747 --> 17:05.481
Mother's worried
about the odd number.

17:05.582 --> 17:07.750
Bad luck, that's all.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.587
Mr. Purnsley
on there?

17:11.688 --> 17:13.623
You said you wanted him.

17:15.558 --> 17:17.791
Well, take him off.

17:17.894 --> 17:19.895
That solve the problem
right there.

17:30.006 --> 17:34.307
<i>(music playing over radio)</i>

17:43.484 --> 17:44.985
Sir?

17:46.354 --> 17:48.655
(clears throat)
Mr. Rothstein.

17:49.957 --> 17:52.058
<i>Will you be needing the car?</i>

17:54.061 --> 17:56.863
No, not this evening.

18:01.702 --> 18:03.101
Are you feeling all right?

18:03.202 --> 18:05.737
I'm fine, thank you.

18:07.306 --> 18:09.307
Is Mrs. Rothstein awake?

18:09.408 --> 18:11.743
No, sir.
She retired early.

18:15.715 --> 18:18.216
May I ask you
a question, Peter?

18:19.350 --> 18:20.851
Of course, sir.

18:23.021 --> 18:24.822
Why is it you don't gamble?

18:26.625 --> 18:28.726
Because I don't have
the stomach for it.

18:32.831 --> 18:36.399
The first time I ever
played craps, I won $32.

18:38.268 --> 18:39.803
I was nine years old.

18:39.904 --> 18:42.405
- Lucky little boy.
- <i>Yes.</i>

18:42.506 --> 18:45.374
Or at least I used to think so.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.360
I need to talk to you.

19:05.461 --> 19:07.428
It's what I'm here for.

19:23.077 --> 19:25.812
There might be
a problem with Chalky.

19:25.913 --> 19:27.147
What problem?

19:27.248 --> 19:30.917
He took his man Purnsley
for a walk in the marsh.

19:31.019 --> 19:32.585
How come?

19:32.687 --> 19:34.287
He was getting out of hand.

19:36.624 --> 19:38.391
Well, good riddance.

19:38.492 --> 19:40.026
Trouble from the get-go.

19:41.028 --> 19:42.962
He puts Narcisse behind it,

19:43.063 --> 19:45.164
wants to return the favor.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.634
How do I agree to that?

19:50.837 --> 19:52.237
What's our concern?

19:52.338 --> 19:55.573
Narcisse has business
with Owney Madden.

19:55.675 --> 19:57.075
Couldn't say who else.

19:57.176 --> 19:59.443
And Madden goes to bat for
some shine knows the Bible?

19:59.545 --> 20:01.579
Is that a bear we need to poke?

20:03.382 --> 20:06.350
I warned him once.
Couldn't have been clearer.

20:06.451 --> 20:08.219
<i>Now he comes to me with this,</i>

20:08.320 --> 20:11.021
and always about how I owe him.

20:11.122 --> 20:14.391
That debt's paid, isn't it?

20:14.492 --> 20:17.460
I'm not saying
there isn't a bond,

20:17.562 --> 20:20.164
but I'm not bringing him
my problems.

20:20.264 --> 20:23.834
If he can't manage
his side of the fence...

20:25.503 --> 20:26.736
The answer is no.

20:26.837 --> 20:29.172
Has to be no.

20:33.443 --> 20:34.776
What else?

20:36.479 --> 20:39.648
- Hmm?
- What else is going on?

20:39.749 --> 20:41.983
Anything I should know?

20:47.990 --> 20:49.624
Willie's doing all right?

20:51.026 --> 20:52.360
Yeah.

20:54.563 --> 20:55.896
Yeah, good.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.634
Everybody's happy
to have him home.

21:08.409 --> 21:09.876
<i>(drawer closes)</i>

21:14.849 --> 21:16.617
Did you call the Sears Roebuck?

21:16.718 --> 21:18.752
You could knock, dear.

21:18.853 --> 21:21.454
On the door that's
not being here yet?

21:21.555 --> 21:24.490
The curtain was closed. Do you
not know what that means?

21:24.591 --> 21:28.561
- What were you doing?
- <i>Getting dressed.</i>

21:28.662 --> 21:30.463
I've seen this many times.

21:30.564 --> 21:32.298
Did you want something?

21:32.399 --> 21:34.099
I ask if you call.

21:35.469 --> 21:38.670
Yes, yes, I did.
I spoke to Mr. Roebuck himself.

21:38.771 --> 21:40.872
He apologized profusely
and told me

21:40.973 --> 21:43.841
he would send a dozen of his
top men over immediately

21:43.942 --> 21:47.512
<i>to remedy the situation</i>
<i>to our total satisfaction.</i>

21:47.613 --> 21:50.448
Really?
This is true?

21:50.549 --> 21:53.151
- No. This is sarcasm.
- <i>(Baby crying)</i>

21:56.854 --> 22:00.691
I was orphaned at a young age,

22:00.792 --> 22:05.529
<i>and what I learned,</i>
<i>I had to learn for myself.</i>

22:05.630 --> 22:09.365
I married young.

22:09.466 --> 22:10.966
- <i>(door opens)</i>
<i>- Too young.</i>

22:11.067 --> 22:15.137
And I haven't lived
a blameless life.

22:15.238 --> 22:17.640
I wonder if anyone has.

22:19.576 --> 22:22.712
I've turned my back
on many things

22:22.813 --> 22:24.847
<i>in anger.</i>

22:24.948 --> 22:26.748
In envy.

22:34.490 --> 22:36.057
In fear.

22:37.226 --> 22:39.928
But love sustains us.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.364
We thrive on it.

22:43.465 --> 22:45.733
We need to give it back.

22:46.868 --> 22:48.869
How else can we live?

22:51.473 --> 22:54.608
That's all I have
to offer my grandson.

22:55.744 --> 22:58.311
I think it's all that matters.

23:01.549 --> 23:04.016
Your Honor,
may my client speak?

23:04.117 --> 23:05.985
Go ahead.

23:10.958 --> 23:12.659
Your Honor...

23:12.760 --> 23:14.926
<i>when Tommy talks about home,</i>

23:15.027 --> 23:17.463
<i>it's our home he's thinking of.</i>

23:17.564 --> 23:22.033
When he goes to sleep, we're
the ones who tuck him in.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.303
When he wakes up
from nightmares,

23:25.405 --> 23:28.874
<i>and he does wake up,</i>
<i>Your Honor,</i>

23:28.975 --> 23:32.710
we're the ones who tell him
it's going to be all right.

23:34.312 --> 23:36.180
And he believes it.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.652
Your Honor, Mrs. Darmody is the
child's paternal grandmother...

23:41.754 --> 23:44.188
Judge: No one disputes
that, Mr. Ferry.

23:44.289 --> 23:47.156
Miss Sagorsky, according to
Judge Varick's notes,

23:47.258 --> 23:50.093
you're employed at
Blatt's department store?

23:50.194 --> 23:51.327
Yes, Your Honor.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.530
- <i>At $12 a week?</i>
<i>- That is correct.</i>

23:53.631 --> 23:55.499
Unmarried.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.066
Pardon?

23:57.167 --> 23:58.535
You are unmarried.

24:00.237 --> 24:02.337
Well, obviously, I'm...

24:03.907 --> 24:04.874
Yes.

24:04.974 --> 24:06.809
And Mr. Sagorsky,
what do you do?

24:08.578 --> 24:10.245
(softly) Veteran's pensions.

24:10.346 --> 24:12.247
Could you speak up, please?

24:12.348 --> 24:14.650
Veteran's pension, sir.

24:14.751 --> 24:16.619
Uh, $37.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.020
37.28, yeah.

24:19.121 --> 24:21.022
$85 a month between you.

24:22.425 --> 24:25.460
85.28.

24:28.564 --> 24:32.066
As I hope your respective
counsels advised you,

24:32.167 --> 24:34.200
in cases such as these,

24:34.302 --> 24:36.537
the law presumes it is
in the child's best interest

24:36.638 --> 24:39.306
to remain in the custody
of blood relatives.

24:39.407 --> 24:42.643
<i>I will review</i>
<i>all Judge Varick's notes,</i>

24:42.744 --> 24:45.913
<i>along with my own, and render
a decision within the month.</i>

24:47.749 --> 24:50.750
<i>(bell tolling)</i>

25:19.411 --> 25:20.979
Phil:
Mueller.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.613
(grunts)

25:24.415 --> 25:25.916
What'd I tell you?

25:28.119 --> 25:31.622
Phil, Mr. Gulliver,
I... Ralph.

25:31.723 --> 25:33.090
- You son of a bitch!
- No, gentlemen, please!

25:33.191 --> 25:35.311
- This is not a good time.
- Not a good time for what?

25:35.393 --> 25:37.994
You're upset.
(grunts)

25:38.095 --> 25:39.529
Two months this took to heal.

25:39.630 --> 25:40.864
Ralph: <i>His wife
bawled her eyes out.</i>

25:40.965 --> 25:42.799
Phil: I didn't make
a sale for months.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.701
I... (grunts)

25:44.802 --> 25:47.203
Not such a tough guy now,
are you, Mueller?

25:47.304 --> 25:49.138
(panting)

25:49.239 --> 25:50.874
Mr. Gulliver,
do something.

25:50.975 --> 25:54.143
- You got it coming, George.
- I apologize. I'm sorry.

25:54.244 --> 25:56.078
If we could just... no!

25:56.179 --> 25:58.180
(grunting)

25:58.281 --> 25:59.982
Enough!
That's it!

26:00.083 --> 26:02.284
- Oh, you don't like it, huh?
- I've warned you to stop!

26:02.319 --> 26:05.287
You hear that, Phil?
He warned us.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.156
Whoa!
Easy, Mueller.

26:07.257 --> 26:08.724
- <i>(train rattling)</i>
<i>- Settle down, George.</i>

26:08.825 --> 26:10.225
Now, George, be reasonable.

26:10.326 --> 26:11.826
Relax.

26:11.927 --> 26:13.794
I am relaxed.

26:13.896 --> 26:14.962
No!

26:18.600 --> 26:19.600
<i>(shell clinks)</i>

26:21.170 --> 26:22.703
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

26:24.840 --> 26:28.042
Nucky: Mickey Doyle is worth
half a million dollars?

26:28.143 --> 26:30.110
Well, not while he's breathing.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.282
"The Rothmere
Insurance Company."

26:35.383 --> 26:37.784
One of my subsidiaries.

26:37.885 --> 26:39.553
So I gather.

26:45.426 --> 26:47.760
So what are you waiting for?
Kill him.

26:49.563 --> 26:51.931
At the very least,
I wanted to extend you

26:52.032 --> 26:54.333
the courtesy of obtaining
your permission.

26:54.435 --> 26:56.569
Do I get a cut?

26:56.670 --> 26:58.003
That's a rather
callous attitude.

26:58.104 --> 27:00.872
He's an imbecile whom
I'd be glad to be rid of.

27:02.241 --> 27:05.009
I was under the impression
Mr. Doyle was

27:05.111 --> 27:07.412
an integral part
of your organization.

27:07.513 --> 27:09.681
Not half a million integral.

27:12.351 --> 27:14.751
- Make me an offer.
- To not kill him?

27:14.852 --> 27:16.520
How's a plug nickel sound?

27:17.956 --> 27:20.891
You could buy
the policy from me,

27:20.992 --> 27:23.860
making yourself
the beneficiary.

27:28.933 --> 27:30.833
Money troubles, Arnold?

27:32.903 --> 27:35.838
Just the usual ebb and
flow of the stock market.

27:35.939 --> 27:38.508
But more ebb at the moment.

27:39.943 --> 27:43.613
It appears I'm the victim
of an unscrupulous broker.

27:43.714 --> 27:46.815
- So plot your revenge.
- <i>That takes cash.</i>

27:46.916 --> 27:50.719
My bankroll is...

27:50.820 --> 27:53.088
waning at present.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.260
10 cents on the dollar.

27:58.361 --> 28:01.296
- 20.
- That's 100 grand, Arnold.

28:01.397 --> 28:03.131
Ye I it ..

28:08.903 --> 28:10.605
(exhales)

28:10.705 --> 28:13.374
It's probably the best
investment I'll ever make.

28:13.475 --> 28:16.710
I know a dozen people
who'd kill Mickey for free.

28:21.815 --> 28:23.950
Good, but line it up
at the bottom.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.560
- Well?
- Yes.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.601
You want to check
behind my ears?

28:42.702 --> 28:45.437
I'm sure you cleaned
thoroughly.

28:45.539 --> 28:48.307
Maybe there are
some splinters left.

28:51.177 --> 28:53.244
- <i>(doorbell rings)</i>
<i>- I'll get it.</i>

28:53.345 --> 28:55.046
We'll both go.

28:58.551 --> 29:01.085
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

29:01.187 --> 29:03.421
I'm not sure
that I want to know.

29:03.522 --> 29:05.122
I do.

29:11.028 --> 29:13.163
- We're not early, are we?
- Oh, no.

29:13.264 --> 29:14.665
(shouting)

29:14.765 --> 29:17.434
I got him! I got him! I got him!

29:18.803 --> 29:21.104
Julia: <i>Ever since you came home.</i>

29:23.740 --> 29:25.708
You think I made him start?

29:25.809 --> 29:27.510
No.

29:27.611 --> 29:31.280
But for some reason, your
being here makes it easier.

29:31.381 --> 29:34.584
It's what he wants, and...

29:34.685 --> 29:36.619
I don't know how you stop him.

29:39.655 --> 29:41.389
What do you two talk about?

29:42.558 --> 29:43.958
How do you mean?

29:44.059 --> 29:46.894
I can hear you downstairs
at 3:00 in the morning.

29:48.097 --> 29:49.897
What do you talk about?

29:51.434 --> 29:55.369
Mmm, things we've been through.

29:56.904 --> 29:58.839
It helps him.

29:58.940 --> 30:01.342
And you.

30:01.443 --> 30:03.910
He worries about you.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.347
We talk about that.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.454
Why is he worried about me?

30:19.126 --> 30:22.595
You're very bad
at hiding things.

30:25.266 --> 30:28.333
I thought I was
pretty good at it.

30:29.469 --> 30:31.836
(crying)

30:31.937 --> 30:33.838
From the drinking?

30:34.940 --> 30:36.841
You need to hear it from him.

30:36.942 --> 30:39.844
He'll never tell me.

30:39.945 --> 30:43.614
He'll tell you when he's ready.

30:51.555 --> 30:54.357
So he expects you
to take care of us?

30:55.860 --> 30:58.561
We just talk, that's all.

30:59.764 --> 31:02.732
I have a job, you know.

31:02.834 --> 31:06.068
One of the girls, she started
two months before me,

31:06.170 --> 31:08.370
and they just made her
a white flower.

31:08.471 --> 31:11.040
- A what?
- <i>A floor manager.</i>

31:11.141 --> 31:13.075
$15 a week.

31:13.177 --> 31:16.012
Hmm.
You could do that.

31:16.113 --> 31:18.580
I know I could.

31:18.682 --> 31:20.516
And you wouldn't need me.

31:21.918 --> 31:23.852
Didn't you hear the judge?

31:26.088 --> 31:29.691
It would be better
if I was married.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.226
Hmm.

31:31.327 --> 31:32.727
To who?

31:34.063 --> 31:36.397
You might do in a pinch.

31:43.538 --> 31:48.275
If you don't say something now,
this is going to be very awkward.

31:49.878 --> 31:52.546
No, I... I didn't...

31:55.850 --> 31:57.183
Yes.

32:00.087 --> 32:01.821
I'm saying yes.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.333
<i>(music playing over radio)</i>

32:14.433 --> 32:17.035
Narcisse: Mr. Purnsley
never arrived.

32:18.704 --> 32:19.671
No, Doctor.

32:19.772 --> 32:23.775
All through
the long lovers' night.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.414
<i>I couldn't make him stay.</i>

32:29.515 --> 32:32.617
- He started getting worried.
- <i>About what?</i>

32:32.718 --> 32:36.388
His wife.
She would ask questions.

32:39.859 --> 32:41.393
Really?

32:42.861 --> 32:45.228
His oldest girl
is getting married.

32:45.329 --> 32:47.264
That's important to him.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.934
Is that what he
talks to you about?

32:51.035 --> 32:53.236
I let him say what he wants.

32:53.337 --> 32:55.572
You listen, he talks.

32:55.673 --> 32:57.775
The night wears on.

32:57.876 --> 33:00.209
I couldn't keep him.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.112
And you haven't seen him since?

33:09.420 --> 33:13.756
You know my wish
is never to involve you,

33:13.857 --> 33:17.659
to keep you separate.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.029
Above the muck that
I have walked through

33:21.130 --> 33:24.499
here in Babylon,

33:24.600 --> 33:27.602
where we each of us
have been exiled.

33:27.703 --> 33:29.037
I know.

33:31.973 --> 33:34.308
The things I do,

33:34.409 --> 33:36.477
just simply to stand up

33:36.578 --> 33:38.479
and look my equals in the eye.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.347
They are not your equals.

33:40.449 --> 33:43.951
Then why must I struggle?

33:44.052 --> 33:46.486
You...

33:46.587 --> 33:49.789
will be clothed in glory.

33:53.861 --> 33:56.963
How well I've trained you.

33:57.064 --> 33:59.666
I will keep him here next time.

34:08.475 --> 34:13.178
You remember what
we pledged to each other

34:13.279 --> 34:16.614
the day we traveled out
from New Orleans?

34:17.951 --> 34:20.717
Many years past now.

34:20.819 --> 34:23.020
We sat in a carriage

34:23.121 --> 34:28.192
more fit for cattle
than for human beings,

34:28.293 --> 34:30.027
and we vowed...

34:30.128 --> 34:33.263
You would protect me.

34:33.364 --> 34:34.864
Always.

34:34.966 --> 34:38.400
And that you would be free...

34:40.036 --> 34:45.007
free to lie down with any man.

34:46.511 --> 34:48.844
But your heart...

34:50.447 --> 34:52.447
Your heart...

34:54.384 --> 34:56.051
Was yours.

34:58.588 --> 35:00.288
Always yours.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.426
Your rug,

35:04.528 --> 35:08.997
glass shards still
in the carpet there.

35:09.097 --> 35:13.835
Mr. White is alive,
and you,

35:13.936 --> 35:19.007
you have crushed me.

35:19.107 --> 35:20.608
Utterly!

35:31.318 --> 35:32.920
(grunts)

35:33.021 --> 35:34.955
<i>(Narcisse panting)</i>

35:35.056 --> 35:38.191
Sigrid: <i>These men,
do they rob you?</i>

35:38.292 --> 35:39.659
No, dear.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.326
Then why does this happen?

35:43.897 --> 35:45.631
They tried to rob me.

35:45.732 --> 35:47.667
They... does it
really matter?!

35:47.768 --> 35:50.703
(gasping)

35:50.804 --> 35:53.839
- You are frightening Chester.
- (Crying)

35:53.941 --> 35:55.607
Why isn't he napping?

35:57.009 --> 35:59.678
Because you have waked him.

35:59.779 --> 36:02.914
You know, I think I'm just
going to say this now.

36:03.015 --> 36:05.750
- I've put up with an awful lot...
- Shh.

36:05.851 --> 36:07.811
- ...that most men would...
- <i>(Pounding on door)</i>

36:07.887 --> 36:09.888
- Al: <i>Mueller!</i>
<i>- (Crying stops)</i>

36:12.123 --> 36:13.724
Take him.

36:13.825 --> 36:17.260
- To where?
- Wherever it is he gets put.

36:17.361 --> 36:18.862
<i>Du forsta?!</i>

36:20.999 --> 36:22.399
<i>(pounding on door)</i>

36:22.500 --> 36:24.401
Al:
<i>Mueller, open up.</i>

36:30.040 --> 36:32.809
- No, no, no, no!
- What the fuck happened, huh?

36:32.910 --> 36:34.911
- My family's here.
- That's your problem.

36:35.012 --> 36:36.679
- I was attacked.
- What, by O'Banion?

36:36.780 --> 36:39.082
No, by some men.

36:39.182 --> 36:41.884
Hooligans. I couldn't see them.
They were laying in wait.

36:41.986 --> 36:44.026
Look, it's not good if
O'Banion knows what's coming.

36:44.053 --> 36:45.386
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

36:45.488 --> 36:48.056
No... yes.
I mean, I do.

36:51.761 --> 36:53.762
Give me till tonight.

36:54.831 --> 36:57.132
I'll wait till after closing.

36:57.233 --> 37:00.501
If you botch this up again...

37:02.037 --> 37:03.570
you know what happens, right?

37:03.672 --> 37:05.472
I won't.

37:05.573 --> 37:07.307
I swear.

37:07.408 --> 37:11.112

37:25.392 --> 37:27.560

37:27.662 --> 37:28.795

37:28.896 --> 37:31.163
Sorry, this part's
rather tricky.

37:31.264 --> 37:32.965
It sounds lovely to me.

He's very talented, isn't he?

37:44.544 --> 37:47.311
- Mm-hmm.
- Only three weeks of lessons.

37:47.412 --> 37:50.682
By the wedding, I expect
we won't need the band.

37:51.984 --> 37:53.384
Speaking of which,

37:53.485 --> 37:55.486
shall we go over
the table assignments?

37:57.422 --> 37:59.490
Sybill: <i>We'll certainly have to
have the pastor on the dais.</i>

37:59.591 --> 38:02.926
<i>(telephone ringing)</i>

38:04.729 --> 38:07.430
Hello, White residence.
This is Maybelle speaking.

38:08.866 --> 38:10.366
<i>He's with guests right now.</i>

38:13.104 --> 38:15.105
I'd be happy to take a message.

38:16.174 --> 38:17.941
Who is it?

38:18.042 --> 38:21.043
Mr. Coates,
the piano player.

38:29.786 --> 38:30.953
Hello?

38:33.924 --> 38:36.858
You stay where you are.

38:36.959 --> 38:38.760
Is everything all right?

38:38.861 --> 38:42.363
- Is he calling for me?
- My apologies.

38:42.464 --> 38:44.398
Matters at the club
need attention.

38:44.499 --> 38:46.701
Daddy.

38:46.802 --> 38:49.604
Mrs. Crawford came here
all the way from Newtonville.

38:49.705 --> 38:51.185
Perhaps Mr. Purnsley
can attend to it?

38:51.273 --> 38:54.842
Afraid he can't.
I'll be back directly.

38:54.943 --> 38:57.678
You keep these good
people entertained, son.

There's 10 minutes left.

39:12.293 --> 39:13.960
<i>(ringing continues)</i>

39:14.061 --> 39:16.829
This is going straight
into the complaint box.

39:21.835 --> 39:23.236
Sorry, folks.

39:23.336 --> 39:25.337
Had to step away for a moment.

39:37.651 --> 39:39.917
Are you sure about this?

39:43.789 --> 39:46.658
It's just a hunting
license, isn't it?

40:02.607 --> 40:05.074
Be easy now,
Mr. White.

40:14.951 --> 40:16.952
Let me see you, girl.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.823
I can't.

40:24.894 --> 40:27.196
Come on, now.

40:27.297 --> 40:29.030
It's okay.

40:39.974 --> 40:41.842
Doctor done this to you?

40:44.912 --> 40:47.715
It was the right hand
of the Lord.

40:49.116 --> 40:53.653
The doctor and Miss
Daughter got their ways.

41:01.395 --> 41:03.295
Know how to tend to her?

41:03.397 --> 41:06.131
Been doing it
longer than I wanted.

41:13.005 --> 41:15.640
You make her comfortable
till I get back.

41:15.742 --> 41:17.242
Yes, sir.

41:20.946 --> 41:25.916
<i>(bells tolling)</i>

<i>says a prayer and gets a
visit from God himself.</i>

<i>"Now, son, I know you're very
curious," God tells him,</i>

<i>"so I'm going to allow you</i>

41:37.061 --> 41:39.629
<i>And so the black man</i>

41:39.730 --> 41:42.265
why is my skin
so black?"

41:42.366 --> 41:44.567
And God replied, "My son,

41:44.668 --> 41:47.737
that is so the intense sun
of Africa won't burn you."

41:47.838 --> 41:50.339
<i>So then the black man</i>
<i>said, "Lord,</i>

41:50.441 --> 41:54.877
<i>why is my head covered</i>
<i>with all this kinky hair?"</i>

41:54.944 --> 41:57.546
<i>And God replied, "My son,</i>

41:57.730 --> 42:00.836
***

42:00.884 --> 42:03.318
- (Laughter)
- So then the black man says,

42:03.420 --> 42:05.888
<i>"Then, Lord,</i>
<i>what in hell's name</i>

I don't believe
I should have to.

"Oh, no, I think
I burned one!"

- Enjoying the ribaldry.
- You know you can't sit here.

42:30.578 --> 42:33.346
What do you call a Negro woman
whose husband just died?

42:33.448 --> 42:37.918
- <i>A black widow.</i>
<i>- (Trombone sting)</i>

42:38.018 --> 42:42.555
Where I am from, there are no such
things as niggers, Mr. Thompson,

42:42.656 --> 42:45.057

42:57.838 --> 42:59.236
It is merely a fact.

I was coming to work and I was

No, the night Stuey bought it,

when you were on your
frolic with the Capones.

44:53.879 --> 44:57.882
- I told you, Mr. O'Banion...
- I know you did, but...

44:57.983 --> 44:59.817
I don't believe you.

45:00.919 --> 45:03.388
How's about the truth, Mueller?

45:04.957 --> 45:06.524
Hmm?

One more "I'm sorry,"
"I don't know,"

45:10.462 --> 45:12.463
"I'm not lookin'
for any trouble,"

45:12.564 --> 45:15.999

45:20.605 --> 45:24.073
I didn't kill Stu.
Al Capone did.

45:25.942 --> 45:28.444
But I have killed other men.

45:28.545 --> 45:32.915
The one you know about,
the three that attacked me,

- and my partner.
- Your what?

45:35.652 --> 45:38.654
I was a Prohibition agent.

45:40.889 --> 45:44.058
I drowned him

My name isn't Mueller.

45:47.630 --> 45:50.465
I'm not legally

You want chrysanthemums,
friend.

46:37.076 --> 46:38.243
That get me out of dutch?

46:38.344 --> 46:40.979
If it doesn't, your money back.
Deal?

46:50.522 --> 46:52.523
<i>(train rattling)</i>

47:22.385 --> 47:25.387
(flies buzzing)

47:43.839 --> 47:46.874
- Get a couple of extra men out here.
- Something up?

47:46.975 --> 47:48.375
Just wouldn't hurt
to be careful.

47:48.476 --> 47:49.976
I'll call the round.

47:51.479 --> 47:54.548
One out front,
another one on...

47:57.285 --> 47:58.985
Nucky:
<i>Don't.</i>

48:05.559 --> 48:07.993
What do you want?

48:08.094 --> 48:10.429
I came to see you.

48:12.232 --> 48:13.766
Why?

48:16.703 --> 48:18.904
I got married today.

48:19.005 --> 48:21.439
Congratulations.

48:22.975 --> 48:24.476
Thank you.

48:26.379 --> 48:28.513
- You came to tell me that?
- <i>No.</i>

48:28.614 --> 48:31.449
I need a job.

48:48.266 --> 48:49.767
What?

48:52.269 --> 48:53.869
Who built this house?

48:55.372 --> 48:56.773
It's late.

48:56.873 --> 48:58.474
Who built it?

49:06.149 --> 49:07.749
You did.

49:10.753 --> 49:12.421
Who pays the bills?

49:14.490 --> 49:15.990
You do.

49:17.627 --> 49:22.631
Who's holding $1,000
in his hand?

49:26.835 --> 49:28.902
You are.

49:33.508 --> 49:35.576
Who am I?

49:37.379 --> 49:39.979
You are my husband.

49:43.451 --> 49:45.352
My name is Nelson Van Alden.

49:56.529 --> 49:58.897
Take off your nightgown.

50:25.357 --> 50:28.358
<i>(music playing over radio)</i>

50:30.528 --> 50:33.864
- <i>(music continues)</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

50:33.964 --> 50:36.266
Me too.

50:36.367 --> 50:38.501
It won't be much longer.

50:40.905 --> 50:43.172
Yes, that'll be fine, sir.

50:45.575 --> 50:47.977
I will take care
of that immediately.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.314
Who was that?

50:52.415 --> 50:54.482
Ah, just business.

50:54.583 --> 50:58.053
- At this hour?
- They're working late in Memphis.

50:59.455 --> 51:00.855
You okay?

51:00.957 --> 51:02.991
No, actually.

51:04.527 --> 51:06.461
You're fightin' the urge.

51:08.997 --> 51:13.434
I need to be strong, for Tommy.

51:13.535 --> 51:15.803
And if you lose him?

51:17.739 --> 51:20.908
No. No.

51:21.009 --> 51:22.843
The decision will be
made for you, Gillian.

51:22.944 --> 51:24.444
You need to prepare.

51:27.481 --> 51:29.816
What I've done for that boy...

51:30.952 --> 51:33.486
it can't all have been
for nothing.

51:34.888 --> 51:36.689
It brought you to me.

51:36.790 --> 51:39.024
Doesn't that count
for somethin'?

51:48.234 --> 51:51.837
(moans) Go home.

51:52.905 --> 51:55.606
I'll be fine in a day or two.

51:57.776 --> 52:00.511
You'll be fine
sooner than that.

52:03.115 --> 52:05.950
The doctor,

52:06.051 --> 52:07.785
what he did...

52:09.388 --> 52:12.389
that wasn't nothing
but for my own good.

52:15.659 --> 52:18.728
*** things we don't.

52:21.732 --> 52:23.566
Divination.

52:23.667 --> 52:26.403
(scoffs)

52:26.504 --> 52:28.170
I think you and me must've gone

52:28.271 --> 52:29.872
to a different church.

52:31.475 --> 52:34.110
Don't act the fool again, girl.

52:34.211 --> 52:36.245
You hear me?

52:36.346 --> 52:38.014
Don't kill him.

52:41.351 --> 52:43.718
Promise me you won't.

52:45.488 --> 52:49.090
Make a promise to you,
break another to myself.

52:51.060 --> 52:53.628
I can't lose you too.

52:54.997 --> 52:56.564
<i>(knock on door)</i>

52:57.766 --> 52:58.900
Don't.

53:01.002 --> 53:02.503
<i>(knocking)</i>

53:03.804 --> 53:06.473
Maybelle:
Daddy, it's me.

53:06.574 --> 53:08.742
I know you're there.

53:12.880 --> 53:16.215
Maybelle,
this is Miss Maitland,

53:16.316 --> 53:18.584
one acts from the club.

53:20.254 --> 53:21.854
She had a accident,
so I come by to...

53:21.955 --> 53:23.622
What'd you come to do, Daddy?

53:25.325 --> 53:26.992
Baby girl, look...

53:33.332 --> 53:36.268
(phone ringing)

53:43.242 --> 53:45.510
Wheet.

53:45.611 --> 53:47.144
Nucky:
<i>Thompson.</i>

53:48.880 --> 53:50.847
How are tricks, Thompson?

53:52.784 --> 53:54.851
It's foggy here.

53:54.953 --> 53:58.222
Did you call to talk
about the weather?

53:58.323 --> 54:00.324
I just called to talk.

54:03.294 --> 54:06.129
Thunderstorm this evening.

54:06.230 --> 54:08.498
Cooled things off a little.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.601
<i>Sunny and hot tomorrow.</i>

54:13.804 --> 54:15.538
Is this exciting you?

54:16.673 --> 54:18.508
Keep going.

54:19.675 --> 54:21.943
It's a clear night.

54:22.044 --> 54:24.413
The moon's out.

54:24.514 --> 54:26.715
I'm sleeping on the porch.

54:26.816 --> 54:29.184
You're not sleeping now.

54:30.587 --> 54:32.354
Somebody woke me up.

54:35.957 --> 54:37.458
Your turn.

54:40.061 --> 54:43.564
What does a man do
down there in Florida?

54:43.665 --> 54:46.300
Aside from gator fights?

54:46.401 --> 54:48.569
<i>You didn't like those?</i>

54:48.670 --> 54:50.438
I won 50 bucks.

54:50.539 --> 54:52.872
Well...

54:52.973 --> 54:55.041
a man does what he wants.

54:55.143 --> 54:58.778
<i>Or maybe he doesn't</i>
<i>do anything at all.</i>

54:58.879 --> 55:01.080
Would you put up
with a man like that?

55:01.182 --> 55:03.816
Maybe.

55:03.917 --> 55:05.519
Not for too long.

55:07.087 --> 55:08.720
I could come down.

55:08.821 --> 55:10.989
You could.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.092
Check on the operation.

55:14.194 --> 55:16.595
Business is business.

55:20.833 --> 55:23.568
I should let you
get back to sleep.

55:23.669 --> 55:25.770
Call me tomorrow.

55:27.005 --> 55:29.740
Maybe a little earlier, though.

55:29.841 --> 55:31.909
I might do that.

55:33.312 --> 55:35.913
Don't get lost in the fog now.
