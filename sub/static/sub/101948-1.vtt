Miss Comstock, the boy.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.759
We need to stop Jake.

02:17.127 --> 02:19.029
You've been saying
that a while now.

02:20.163 --> 02:21.365
I mean it.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.401
You're all the same.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.909
I mean it Jake, we're done.

02:32.977 --> 02:34.110
You mean until next time?

02:34.177 --> 02:38.048
No done, like we never started.

02:38.115 --> 02:38.983
But we did,

02:40.150 --> 02:40.850
and we wouldn't want
a certain somebody

02:40.918 --> 02:42.319
to find out about it.

02:46.456 --> 02:48.058
How would that happen?

02:48.959 --> 02:49.826
I don't know.

02:51.929 --> 02:52.862
Loose lips.

02:57.967 --> 02:59.069
That's headed this way.

03:00.137 --> 03:01.638
It's headed to my place.

03:07.978 --> 03:09.681
Don't, please baby, die.

03:11.181 --> 03:12.782
No, let me do it.

03:17.854 --> 03:20.724
Tommy, Tommy, come
on baby talk to me.

03:22.926 --> 03:24.460
Talk to me.

03:24.527 --> 03:26.330
Okay, okay, we got it.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.168
Tommy, come on baby, talk to me.

03:32.235 --> 03:34.103
How'd he get in the pond?

03:34.170 --> 03:35.538
I thought you were watching him?

03:35.605 --> 03:37.807
No, I was in the fields.

03:37.875 --> 03:38.975
You were supposed
to come get him.

03:40.243 --> 03:42.746
Tommy.

03:42.812 --> 03:47.818
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,
talk to me, baby.

03:49.787 --> 03:51.121
Tommy?

03:51.187 --> 03:52.055
Come on.

03:53.056 --> 03:54.824
Tommy, baby.

04:13.911 --> 04:15.445
Please, don't.

04:15.513 --> 04:16.314
It has nothing to
do with you, Grace.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.981
Please Martha, you promised.

04:18.781 --> 04:20.517
He did this, right?

04:21.785 --> 04:23.388
I forgive you, Grace.

04:24.221 --> 04:25.656
But I can't forgive him.

04:38.935 --> 04:40.404
I know about you and grace.

04:40.937 --> 04:42.072
She told me everything.

04:43.139 --> 04:44.074
Everything, huh?

04:45.009 --> 04:45.877
Enough.

04:47.077 --> 04:48.278
She tell you what it's
like to be married

04:48.346 --> 04:50.882
to a church mouse with
a shoe-leather pussy?

04:53.317 --> 04:56.853
When Tommy was drowning, you
were screwing my best friend

04:56.920 --> 04:58.822
when you should've
been here with him.

05:00.557 --> 05:02.959
Our son may never
even learn to read.

05:03.026 --> 05:04.961
What do you want me
to do about that?

05:06.096 --> 05:08.699
You put it on me, you
sick son of a bitch.

05:10.134 --> 05:12.437
You got a retarded
child, go tend to him.

05:14.872 --> 05:16.706
May God have mercy on you, Jake.

05:17.574 --> 05:19.041
If God had any mercy,

05:19.108 --> 05:21.111
he would have left
that boy in the water.

05:28.117 --> 05:29.086
What the fuck?

06:02.353 --> 06:03.254
I feel sick.

06:08.091 --> 06:09.026
Where are we going?

06:10.192 --> 06:12.862
Brother's, a
couple hours from here.

06:12.930 --> 06:13.865
The ex con?

06:14.764 --> 06:16.199
He's got a place we can stay.

06:17.901 --> 06:18.701
Loser.

06:18.769 --> 06:19.637
What'd you say?

06:21.170 --> 06:22.173
Another loser.

06:24.942 --> 06:26.076
You two have
something in common.

07:50.259 --> 07:51.329
You were lucky.

07:53.997 --> 07:55.266
I hear your horn.

07:58.267 --> 07:59.869
Drive too fast.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.108
Tom.

08:06.375 --> 08:07.243
Alex.

08:09.045 --> 08:09.913
Thank you.

08:11.915 --> 08:14.285
There was a man driving,
you didn't see him?

08:17.788 --> 08:19.790
Maybe he fall in the river.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.228
Jesus.

08:31.134 --> 08:32.669
I need to go look for him.

08:33.537 --> 08:34.871
Can't go out now.

08:36.038 --> 08:37.240
Storm is bad.

08:40.376 --> 08:42.111
You rest now, okay?

08:43.547 --> 08:45.048
We'll look for him tomorrow.

08:50.453 --> 08:51.322
Yeah, okay.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.292
Ok...

10:16.405 --> 10:17.807
Hey, where are you going?

10:19.142 --> 10:21.345
My mom friend house.

10:25.315 --> 10:26.450
Don't you have a car?

10:28.951 --> 10:32.456
Stay here, I come back soon.

11:56.373 --> 11:59.175
I'm Alex, thank you
so much for coming.

11:59.241 --> 12:00.442
Are you okay?

12:00.509 --> 12:01.677
Yeah, but my friend was with me

12:01.745 --> 12:03.413
and I need to find him.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.883
I'm grace, get
in the car, we'll go.

12:09.086 --> 12:11.455
Jesus, you
carried me all this way?

12:12.655 --> 12:16.459
I walk through the
woods, it's not so far.

12:34.778 --> 12:37.615
Well, it looks like you're going
have to take the bus home.

12:48.658 --> 12:51.028
I think your friend gone.

12:52.662 --> 12:53.463
I'm sorry.

12:58.501 --> 13:01.537
It's chilly, let's go
to my house for coffee.

13:02.672 --> 13:05.008
His mom is visiting her sister,

13:05.075 --> 13:06.377
but she'll be back tonight.

13:09.178 --> 13:11.514
The service in this
house is really bad.

13:11.581 --> 13:13.651
You'd have better luck
with the landline.

13:24.326 --> 13:27.932
<i>Hi, this is
Vi, I can't talk right now, bye.</i>

13:31.067 --> 13:33.569
I don't mean to sound
ungrateful, but I should go.

13:34.504 --> 13:36.139
Well, what about your friend?

13:37.106 --> 13:38.307
He lucked out.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.210
He called someone and
they came and got him.

13:42.211 --> 13:43.246
Are you all right?

13:44.181 --> 13:46.049
Yeah, yeah.

13:46.115 --> 13:47.716
You said there's a bus station?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.785
Oh yeah, in town.

13:49.852 --> 13:50.886
We'll get your stuff.

13:52.489 --> 13:54.357
It's a good thing,
Tommy was out there.

13:54.423 --> 13:56.025
I didn't hear a thing.

13:57.193 --> 13:58.327
What's wrong with him?

13:58.394 --> 14:01.563
Fell in pond when he
was little, almost died.

14:01.630 --> 14:03.365
But he does just fine.

14:03.432 --> 14:05.269
He looks after both our places.

14:07.837 --> 14:09.505
What about his father?

14:09.572 --> 14:11.341
Oh, he took off ages ago.

14:11.408 --> 14:13.509
Stupid piece of shit.

14:13.576 --> 14:15.177
Who takes care of him?

14:15.245 --> 14:16.245
His mom and me.

14:18.115 --> 14:19.115
We've been friends
forever,

14:19.182 --> 14:20.750
through the best and
the worst of it.

14:21.684 --> 14:23.585
Is there anything
I can do to thank him?

14:23.653 --> 14:25.055
Oh, don't make a fuss.

14:25.121 --> 14:26.688
We keep to ourselves.

14:26.755 --> 14:29.058
If you want to catch
that bus we got to go.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.567
So how long have you been
working behind the bar?

14:37.634 --> 14:38.435
Doing this?

14:38.501 --> 14:42.137
Uh, wow, Since I was like five.

14:42.205 --> 14:44.041
Yeah, I took a
class in Montessori.

14:50.547 --> 14:51.514
Hey, what's up?

14:52.649 --> 14:53.716
Where's Alex?

14:53.783 --> 14:55.217
She didn't show up.

14:55.284 --> 14:56.620
She didn't even call.

14:57.721 --> 14:59.355
I think that she had this thing

14:59.422 --> 15:01.624
that came up with her boyfriend.

15:01.691 --> 15:04.427
Bree, please don't
fire her, please.

15:05.828 --> 15:08.399
Not until we figure
out what happened?

15:19.775 --> 15:21.110
What happened?

15:23.712 --> 15:25.115
Have you seen Frank?

15:25.182 --> 15:26.050
No.

15:27.484 --> 15:28.384
Where's your car.

15:30.687 --> 15:31.555
Wrecked.

15:32.422 --> 15:33.656
Okay, let me take you home.

15:33.722 --> 15:34.591
No.

15:35.558 --> 15:36.427
I can't.

15:46.702 --> 15:47.737
You see this?

15:48.705 --> 15:50.507
What's this?

15:50.573 --> 15:53.076
He was a fence,
shop was a front.

15:54.811 --> 15:57.547
I know this guy, Frank used

15:57.614 --> 15:59.483
to sell him all of
his gambling take.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.485
Yeah, a lot of stuff
that was hot too.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.520
They were partners for awhile.

16:06.623 --> 16:08.459
But lately it wasn't
going to well.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.367
That ones worth
at least three K.

16:19.001 --> 16:22.505
Maybe if it wasn't hot,
best I can do is 900.

16:27.977 --> 16:29.078
Last week Frank heard a rumor

16:29.145 --> 16:31.580
that he took in a
big haul of diamonds

16:31.648 --> 16:34.183
and gold, some
inside job in L.A.

16:34.850 --> 16:37.854
So Tuesday Frank arranged for me

16:37.921 --> 16:40.124
to stop by his place
after he closed.

16:41.791 --> 16:42.659
Jason?

16:43.426 --> 16:44.495
You there?

16:46.328 --> 16:49.765
Around back, come to the gate.

16:58.674 --> 16:59.543
Hey.

17:07.415 --> 17:08.351
Something wrong?

17:09.586 --> 17:11.688
No, it's, I've never
been down here before.

17:12.454 --> 17:15.223
It's just a place,
for special people.

17:17.425 --> 17:18.828
Um...

17:19.395 --> 17:21.497
Frank wanted you to
hold on to these.

17:21.564 --> 17:23.800
He's off playing pool somewhere

17:23.866 --> 17:27.569
and he didn't want
them around the house.

17:29.838 --> 17:31.307
So where'd they come from?

17:31.974 --> 17:32.842
I don't know.

17:33.876 --> 17:34.744
I never know.

17:36.980 --> 17:38.548
Is that all you got for me?

17:40.983 --> 17:43.552
Well, actually Frank said

17:43.619 --> 17:45.821
you could show me
some nice jewelry.

17:45.888 --> 17:47.490
My birthday's coming up.

17:47.557 --> 17:48.424
Okay, kiddo.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.245
You got any diamonds?

18:09.511 --> 18:10.579
Sure.

18:10.645 --> 18:12.449
They're a bit out
of Frank's range.

18:15.751 --> 18:17.320
It couldn't hurt
to look could it?

18:18.355 --> 18:21.325
I mean, we could do a deal.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.597
Sure.

18:44.513 --> 18:45.580
What the hell are you doing?

18:45.647 --> 18:46.582
Hey got off!

18:47.916 --> 18:49.451
Let go!

18:49.519 --> 18:51.487
Stop, let go!

18:53.490 --> 18:54.691
Nice work honey.

19:02.932 --> 19:04.000
You shot him.

19:04.634 --> 19:05.701
Yeah I did.

19:06.702 --> 19:08.404
He never open the safe for me.

19:13.777 --> 19:14.811
He's dead Frank.

19:17.946 --> 19:20.750
Yeah, but look what he left us.

19:29.491 --> 19:31.528
You didn't say you
were gonna kill him.

19:32.561 --> 19:33.663
Didn't say I wasn't.

19:38.201 --> 19:39.469
And then we crashed.

19:40.936 --> 19:45.808
And this guy came out of nowhere
and saved my worthless ass.

19:48.611 --> 19:49.646
But Frank was gone.

19:51.213 --> 19:53.549
Best case scenario,
somewhere in the river.

19:56.553 --> 19:58.054
And what about the jewelry?

19:58.121 --> 19:59.089
Stashed.

20:00.222 --> 20:02.157
I didn't want to
get caught with it.

20:02.224 --> 20:03.592
I didn't know what
happened to Frank,

20:03.660 --> 20:04.995
but what if the cops had him?

20:09.632 --> 20:12.001
Vi, we murdered a guy.

20:12.701 --> 20:15.005
No <i>you</i> didn't.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.539
I set him up.

20:16.605 --> 20:18.741
No, it doesn't
matter who did what.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.412
You need to get out of town.

20:22.479 --> 20:24.146
Okay, you're the only
witness to this thing

20:24.213 --> 20:25.815
and if Frank is alive.

20:25.882 --> 20:26.750
I know.

20:28.684 --> 20:30.553
After the robbery he was ice.

20:33.490 --> 20:34.723
I think the plan
was to take me out

20:34.790 --> 20:36.393
to the woods and get rid of me.

20:39.628 --> 20:41.497
Well, hopefully
you'll never find out.

20:43.833 --> 20:45.402
I'll lay low for a few days.

20:46.736 --> 20:49.506
If Frank doesn't show I'll
get the stash and run.

20:51.173 --> 20:54.144
Mexico, Argentina, Chile...

20:55.178 --> 20:56.646
as far as I can.

21:00.983 --> 21:03.486
Hey, you're safe here.

21:04.186 --> 21:05.020
Okay?

21:06.689 --> 21:07.657
Give me your phone.

21:08.990 --> 21:11.160
I'm going to get you a
new phone and a new number

21:11.227 --> 21:14.831
and you don't go anywhere
unless you absolutely have to.

21:19.801 --> 21:21.036
Oh shit.

21:31.548 --> 21:33.150
See you survived the storm.

21:34.717 --> 21:38.621
Tom is a real hero, and that
is the truth of the pudding.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.224
Well, I'm not even a
little bit surprised.

21:41.290 --> 21:42.826
He's made of strong stuff.

21:45.193 --> 21:47.529
What was she like, the girl?

21:47.596 --> 21:49.664
Nice, a little
on the nervous side.

21:49.731 --> 21:51.600
The accident really
shook her up.

21:53.336 --> 21:54.570
She was pretty?

21:56.005 --> 21:57.607
She couldn't say
enough good things about Tom.

21:58.106 --> 22:00.175
Well hardly anybody
meets our boy

22:00.242 --> 22:01.943
doesn't fall in love with him.

22:25.801 --> 22:28.605
Well you had quite
the adventure.

22:29.137 --> 22:31.173
I go for a walk in the rain.

22:33.276 --> 22:34.678
You like the rain.

22:38.681 --> 22:40.016
So, uh...

22:43.752 --> 22:45.120
then you found this girl?

22:46.355 --> 22:50.059
I bring her home, she
have to sleep here.

22:54.364 --> 22:55.832
How'd you get the blouse?

22:56.965 --> 22:59.802
She leave it,
cause it ripped.

23:03.172 --> 23:04.908
You're my special boy.

23:07.175 --> 23:09.846
You've always been
my special boy.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.120
I love you so much.

23:19.655 --> 23:20.923
How much do I love you?

23:22.659 --> 23:23.693
Big as the sky.

23:25.327 --> 23:26.863
As big as the sky.

23:28.798 --> 23:32.301
And the moon, and all the stars.

23:40.809 --> 23:42.177
Okay, to bed, to bed.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.996
Our father who art in heaven.

25:07.063 --> 25:09.098
Hallowed be thy name.

25:09.164 --> 25:12.434
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

25:12.501 --> 25:14.303
on earth as it is in heaven.

25:15.438 --> 25:17.907
Give us this day,
our daily bread

25:17.973 --> 25:20.009
and forgive us, our trespasses.

25:20.076 --> 25:23.112
As we forgive those
who trespass against us

25:23.179 --> 25:25.214
and lead us, not
into temptation,

25:25.280 --> 25:27.316
but deliver us from evil.

25:27.383 --> 25:28.250
For ours...

25:30.452 --> 25:33.122
If there's anything I can do.

25:33.189 --> 25:34.791
Sam, leave me be.

25:39.127 --> 25:41.063
Reverend, reverend.

25:42.198 --> 25:43.166
Tell me this.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.735
How could God do this?

25:47.569 --> 25:48.904
He was such a good boy.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.743
He was only good, he
never hurt anyone,

25:53.809 --> 25:56.346
he never even had
an unkind thought.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.149
As much as we try, we can never

26:00.215 --> 26:02.517
truly understand how God works.

26:02.585 --> 26:04.254
Oh, understand?

26:06.989 --> 26:09.158
What's to understand?

26:09.224 --> 26:13.828
This is just cruel, this
is an act of cruelty,

26:13.895 --> 26:18.867
God's laughing at me, and
you, and you...

26:18.934 --> 26:20.436
and all of you!

27:05.347 --> 27:06.215
Tom?

27:11.554 --> 27:12.756
Tom?

27:22.565 --> 27:23.432
Tom?

27:24.634 --> 27:25.501
You home?

27:32.974 --> 27:33.842
Tom?

27:53.028 --> 27:54.395
Who are you?

27:54.462 --> 27:56.397
What are you doing in my house?

27:56.464 --> 27:58.333
I just came to see Tom.

27:59.335 --> 28:00.236
Tommy's dead.

28:06.942 --> 28:09.144
What are you doing here?

28:09.211 --> 28:10.078
I'm sorry.

28:11.145 --> 28:13.548
There's, there's someone
down there.

28:13.615 --> 28:15.317
Martha, Tom's mom.

28:15.384 --> 28:18.019
I didn't mean to intrude,
I'm really sorry.

28:18.086 --> 28:21.891
Don't worry, you just go sit
down and I'll see to Martha.

28:23.392 --> 28:26.496
So sad, they just
buried him on Wednesday.

28:27.963 --> 28:30.332
I had no idea.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.568
If it's okay, I'd
love to meet her.

28:33.635 --> 28:36.271
I'm happy to get a room,
come back tomorrow.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.673
You better hold off on that.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.876
Martha needs some time alone.

28:42.510 --> 28:43.378
I understand.

28:44.313 --> 28:45.415
I'll just be on my way.

28:51.153 --> 28:52.621
Who was that girl?

28:52.688 --> 28:55.325
That's the girl
from the accident.

28:57.526 --> 28:58.862
What's she doing here?

29:01.130 --> 29:02.264
Where are you going?

29:06.201 --> 29:07.069
Why?

29:09.571 --> 29:10.439
Why him?

29:12.375 --> 29:14.143
Why not me, I'm the sinner.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.082
He never hurt a soul.

29:27.288 --> 29:29.223
Old witch scared
the shit out of me.

29:29.290 --> 29:31.260
And then I couldn't
get past her friend.

29:32.127 --> 29:34.463
Well the good news is
that nobody's seen Frank.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.133
I'll wait a week.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.271
Go back out, take care of
business and then, outta here.

29:45.508 --> 29:46.375
You okay?

29:47.276 --> 29:49.579
Yeah, just beat.

29:50.746 --> 29:52.315
My stomach's queasy.

30:14.135 --> 30:18.273
I've been looking for
yoU, but I can't find you.

30:20.108 --> 30:21.310
Where'd you go?

30:50.839 --> 30:52.708
Hey, you're up early.

30:54.576 --> 30:56.211
I went to the women's clinic.

30:58.847 --> 31:00.482
One of Frank's sperm got lucky.

31:02.384 --> 31:03.251
Shit.

31:06.321 --> 31:09.524
Two miscarriages, a
handful of specialists,

31:09.592 --> 31:12.194
and three guys I
kicked to the curb

31:12.260 --> 31:14.529
who actually would have
made decent fathers.

31:15.663 --> 31:17.331
Then after they
told me my uterus

31:17.398 --> 31:20.469
is basically a toxic waste dump.

31:21.769 --> 31:24.639
Fucking Frank, the
only real sociopath

31:24.707 --> 31:27.176
in the pack somehow
knocks me up.

31:29.711 --> 31:30.579
Okay.

31:32.647 --> 31:35.416
Well, next time you'll...

31:35.483 --> 31:38.153
They're saying there isn't
going to be a next time.

31:38.220 --> 31:41.757
And it's only 50, 50
I'll carry to term,

31:41.824 --> 31:44.259
even if I do everything, right.

31:45.627 --> 31:46.662
Like what?

31:47.729 --> 31:50.365
Stay off my feet
the first trimester,

31:51.799 --> 31:53.635
avoid any kind of stress.

31:55.804 --> 31:57.707
I've been through
it before, it sucks.

32:01.844 --> 32:06.783
Hey, do you want to do this?

32:08.550 --> 32:11.119
Then I will be there
every step of the way,

32:11.186 --> 32:12.387
whatever you need.

32:13.855 --> 32:15.625
I'll make it up to you, I swear.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.460
We'll get that stash

32:18.527 --> 32:20.263
and we'll be done with
the bars for good.

32:21.430 --> 32:23.432
We can go live in South America,

32:23.499 --> 32:24.700
I've got family there,

32:24.767 --> 32:28.203
and I'll pay my kid's
way through Princeton.

32:29.837 --> 32:31.440
I know you will.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.180
I need you to help
me find a new place,

32:38.247 --> 32:39.649
somewhere Frank won't find me.

32:40.782 --> 32:42.350
I can't drive, you
have to take me

32:42.417 --> 32:44.119
to the clinic every week or so.

32:44.886 --> 32:47.722
And shop, and keep a look out.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.495
No sign of Frank anywhere.

32:53.561 --> 32:54.629
You checked the apartment?

32:54.696 --> 32:56.697
Yeah, mail's piling up.

32:56.765 --> 32:58.201
You can relax, he's gone.

33:00.269 --> 33:03.271
Can't, not until I'm
sure that prick is dead.

33:04.906 --> 33:07.509
Martha, Martha!

33:10.546 --> 33:12.346
I've been working
in the County fair.

33:12.413 --> 33:14.482
I should've never
let her get that way.

33:14.549 --> 33:15.817
Can you get in?

33:15.884 --> 33:16.751
Yup.

33:19.520 --> 33:23.725
Martha, Martha!

33:26.761 --> 33:27.629
Martha?

33:28.763 --> 33:29.831
You up there?

33:34.670 --> 33:35.504
Martha?

33:43.412 --> 33:46.748
Hold it doc, that's
her personal space.

33:46.815 --> 33:47.917
Let me check it out.

33:57.925 --> 34:00.295
My God, what are you doing?

34:02.330 --> 34:04.166
I was just thinking about...

34:05.968 --> 34:07.436
all the good times we had.

34:07.970 --> 34:11.507
You and me, Tommy.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.212
God.

34:19.581 --> 34:21.317
Oh that bastard Jake.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.954
That son of a bitch.

34:26.188 --> 34:28.757
We agreed we'd never
talk about him again.

34:31.092 --> 34:32.728
What difference does it make?

34:33.762 --> 34:35.498
It was so long ago.

34:36.731 --> 34:38.000
Doctor Sam is upstairs

34:38.067 --> 34:41.670
and he wants to see you,
not another word about that.

34:44.039 --> 34:45.608
No more about that.

34:50.445 --> 34:52.346
You're going to be fine.

34:52.414 --> 34:53.447
I want you to come see me

34:53.514 --> 34:55.617
at my office in a
couple of weeks.

34:58.619 --> 35:00.822
This will help her
with the depression.

35:00.889 --> 35:02.291
Will you make sure she takes it?

35:02.358 --> 35:03.292
You can count on it.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.695
Someone should
look after her.

35:06.762 --> 35:08.497
No worries about that either.

35:15.137 --> 35:16.772
Come on M, take your pill.

35:17.773 --> 35:20.509
I keep asking why?

35:24.913 --> 35:26.382
Never get an answer.

35:35.056 --> 35:36.724
How ya doing hun?

35:36.791 --> 35:37.925
I'm okay.

35:37.992 --> 35:40.996
Just don't feel like
talking, that's all.

35:41.063 --> 35:42.530
Well you take your time.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.501
I'm here when you do.

35:53.474 --> 35:55.610
Okay Gracie, see if
she wants to start up.

35:56.644 --> 35:57.679
Okay!

36:05.019 --> 36:06.355
That's a connection.

36:07.088 --> 36:09.958
You are doing so much better.

36:12.427 --> 36:15.663
Yeah but you know, the
hurt's still wearing on me.

36:15.731 --> 36:17.900
Time hun, time.

36:19.434 --> 36:21.369
<i>...attack
on Pearl Harbor.</i>

36:25.740 --> 36:26.608
Who's there?

36:29.978 --> 36:30.811
Why didn't you answer me?

36:30.878 --> 36:33.414
I can't hear you over the TV.

36:34.550 --> 36:35.618
How are you feeling?

36:36.985 --> 36:38.653
Dizzy, weak.

36:39.688 --> 36:40.923
I talked to the doctor,

36:40.989 --> 36:44.025
he says I have to stay put
another month or so.

36:44.092 --> 36:45.994
But besides that
you're doing okay?

36:47.996 --> 36:50.932
Except that I keep saying Frank
walking through that door.

36:51.867 --> 36:53.602
You're still worried about him?

36:55.204 --> 36:57.340
No, not that much.

36:58.873 --> 37:00.741
Now it's mostly about this.

37:00.809 --> 37:02.544
I keep thinking even if
the baby survives

37:02.610 --> 37:05.980
the swamp down there I'll
manage to mess it up.

37:06.047 --> 37:07.349
No you won't.

37:08.750 --> 37:09.550
What are you going to do about

37:09.617 --> 37:11.619
this old woman and the jewelry?

37:11.686 --> 37:12.686
What if she finds your stuff,

37:12.753 --> 37:13.855
what if she figures out

37:13.922 --> 37:15.056
that you're the one
that put it there?

37:15.123 --> 37:18.059
She won't, I doubt
she even remembers me,

37:19.728 --> 37:21.463
but I have to
reconnect with her.

37:22.998 --> 37:23.865
You're okay.

37:25.601 --> 37:26.635
You both are.

37:44.519 --> 37:49.391
<i>Dear Mrs. Comstock, I hope
this note finds you well.</i>

37:50.692 --> 37:52.260
<i>I think of your son often</i>

37:52.327 --> 37:54.996
<i>and would appreciate
the chance to see you</i>

37:55.063 --> 37:56.798
<i>and talk about him.</i>

37:58.199 --> 38:00.835
<i>Fondly, Alex Parker.</i>

38:21.556 --> 38:22.891
Oh Grace.

38:22.958 --> 38:25.860
You're not going to believe
this, wait till you see.

38:29.264 --> 38:30.966
This just came in the mail.

38:32.934 --> 38:35.103
Oh, isn't that nice.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.206
Do you remember her
coming by to see you?

38:38.606 --> 38:39.442
I do.

38:41.710 --> 38:42.911
Look at this.

38:42.978 --> 38:45.447
Oh, she's going to have a baby.

38:46.847 --> 38:47.815
Do you know she sent Tom

38:47.882 --> 38:50.920
a wrist watch with
his name on it?

38:53.054 --> 38:54.456
No, I had no idea.

38:56.592 --> 38:57.793
Grace.

38:57.860 --> 39:01.195
Think back to when she
spent the night here,

39:01.262 --> 39:04.199
she and Tommy were here alone
together all night long.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.469
I'm not pretending to know

39:09.237 --> 39:11.706
exactly what happened or
what's on her mind now,

39:11.773 --> 39:15.244
but she says she
wants to see me.

39:16.945 --> 39:19.614
Her return address
is a post office box.

39:19.681 --> 39:21.016
Did she leave a phone number?

39:23.885 --> 39:27.289
I know what you're thinking
and you are probably wrong.

39:27.356 --> 39:29.558
You know nothing
about this girl.

39:29.625 --> 39:31.626
I have to see her.

39:33.161 --> 39:34.230
Have to talk to her.

39:38.333 --> 39:41.170
There's an old saying
my mother once told me.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.106
If a stone falls in the water,

39:45.172 --> 39:48.776
a thousand wise men,
can't bring it back.

39:49.878 --> 39:51.313
Think about it.

39:51.378 --> 39:55.049
Maybe you're looking for peace
of mind in the wrong place.

40:00.188 --> 40:01.757
What's done is done.

40:03.324 --> 40:05.093
There's no changing it now.

40:10.231 --> 40:15.237
My comfort is in thinking that
maybe it was all meant to be.

40:18.139 --> 40:20.542
I wish I knew what I
was supposed to do.

40:22.411 --> 40:27.615
Alex, thank you so much for the
kind words and lovely photo.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.251
Please accept my
apology for the way

40:30.318 --> 40:32.821
I behaved the day
you came to see me.

40:34.088 --> 40:37.358
Was a very bad time,
but I'm much better now.

40:37.425 --> 40:39.893
And if you have it in your
heart to forgive my rudeness,

40:39.960 --> 40:41.094
it would be my great pleasure

40:41.161 --> 40:44.198
for you to come visit
any time it suits.

40:44.266 --> 40:46.901
I would so enjoy talking to you,

40:46.967 --> 40:49.370
all my best, Martha Comstock.

40:49.438 --> 40:51.139
There's our invitation.

40:51.206 --> 40:54.009
Okay, I've got one
more battery of tests

40:54.076 --> 40:55.911
and then they say,
I'll be okay to travel.

41:05.853 --> 41:07.689
Let me help
you with that Vi.

41:09.757 --> 41:10.625
Frank.

41:11.525 --> 41:13.694
More Frankenstein than Frank.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.864
You've been gone for
the last few months.

41:16.931 --> 41:18.099
Better part of a year.

41:20.402 --> 41:22.804
By the way, my honey around?

41:23.739 --> 41:24.940
I can't seem to find her.

41:27.976 --> 41:31.079
She left town a couple
months after you disappeared.

41:31.146 --> 41:32.715
Took a job in Eugene I think.

41:34.516 --> 41:36.184
I figured something like that.

41:37.251 --> 41:38.753
I get it.

41:38.820 --> 41:40.289
She needed to do her own thing.

41:42.858 --> 41:45.760
Hey, if you're busy, we
can talk some other time.

41:45.827 --> 41:49.231
No, no that's okay, I have
some time before my shift.

41:50.297 --> 41:51.132
Come in.

41:59.240 --> 42:02.043
Do you still take
your coffee, black?

42:02.443 --> 42:04.144
I'm off of caffeine.

42:04.211 --> 42:05.280
Got any herbal tea?

42:06.847 --> 42:08.182
Yeah.

42:10.786 --> 42:11.653
Yeah.

42:15.190 --> 42:18.226
Sugar, alcohol, dope.

42:19.226 --> 42:20.061
Done with it.

42:23.297 --> 42:25.333
Accident put me
through some changes.

42:26.934 --> 42:28.036
Yeah, I can see that.

42:29.938 --> 42:30.972
Disappeared for awhile.

42:32.039 --> 42:35.175
I was on a road trip to
see a friend out East.

42:35.242 --> 42:37.679
Driving too fast as
usual and no seatbelt.

42:38.980 --> 42:40.748
I wrecked bad.

42:40.815 --> 42:42.817
So bad I blacked out.

42:44.219 --> 42:46.221
Somehow I got
tossed into a river.

42:47.489 --> 42:50.793
When I woke up the car
was gone and I was,

42:52.092 --> 42:56.030
no sense of mincing
words, totally fucked up.

43:04.505 --> 43:08.242
Lucky thing the kids who found
me had phones, mine was gone.

43:11.246 --> 43:12.181
Called my brother.

43:14.382 --> 43:16.351
Told him what happened
and where I was.

43:17.619 --> 43:18.987
You look bad, Frank.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.190
No shit.

43:22.257 --> 43:23.125
I had no idea.

43:24.860 --> 43:26.827
You need a hospital, bro.

43:26.894 --> 43:29.264
No hospitals, just
give me a shot.

43:40.041 --> 43:41.910
Don't blame me if
you don't wake up.

43:41.976 --> 43:43.112
Shut up and shoot me.

43:45.981 --> 43:48.150
Brother called Alex,
but she didn't pick up.

43:49.416 --> 43:51.018
I'm sure she was pissed at me.

43:52.019 --> 43:53.355
She was always pissed at me.

43:55.523 --> 43:56.657
Before his first prison term,

43:56.724 --> 43:59.128
brother was taking a
night course in nursing.

44:01.896 --> 44:02.963
I thought he could
take care of me,

44:03.030 --> 44:06.000
which might've been a mistake.

44:11.338 --> 44:14.576
I was busted in more
places than I can name.

44:14.643 --> 44:18.947
Also, my right eye was toast.

44:21.282 --> 44:23.184
For a while there,
it was touch and go.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.927
Do you have to blow
smoke in my face?

44:35.429 --> 44:40.134
But after I pulled back from
the abyss, I started thinking,

44:40.201 --> 44:43.204
reflecting on my past deeds
in a way I never did before.

44:44.572 --> 44:46.175
I had plenty of time for that.

44:47.275 --> 44:49.244
It was close to four months

44:49.311 --> 44:51.313
before I could stand
on my own two feet.

44:53.213 --> 44:56.552
I called Alex before
her number went bye bye.

44:59.054 --> 45:00.289
That was food for thought.

45:02.990 --> 45:05.960
Over time, a lot of time,

45:06.628 --> 45:08.663
the old Frank, the hustler

45:08.730 --> 45:11.233
with a 10 ton chip on
his shoulder, faded away.

45:12.599 --> 45:15.969
And gradually a new Frank,

45:16.036 --> 45:20.908
a lot more patient and
tolerant, took his place.

45:20.976 --> 45:22.010
We would agree
that the old Frank

45:22.077 --> 45:23.512
needed an overhaul wouldn't we?

45:28.682 --> 45:31.954
Well, that Frank is history.

45:37.257 --> 45:39.124
I should go.

45:42.563 --> 45:44.464
I just wish Alex was here

45:44.532 --> 45:47.135
so I could apologize for
the way I mistreated her.

45:49.403 --> 45:53.041
I guess you don't have
a number or an address?

45:53.108 --> 45:56.211
No, no, I haven't talked
to her since she left town.

45:57.679 --> 45:59.381
I'm sure she'll pop
up one of these days.

46:00.081 --> 46:01.516
Maybe it's all for the better.

46:04.485 --> 46:08.588
Oh, would it be okay for
me to use your phone?

46:08.655 --> 46:09.958
I left mine where I'm staying.

46:11.393 --> 46:13.561
Yeah, sure.

46:21.436 --> 46:23.071
Come on.

46:27.608 --> 46:28.911
Look at that.

46:29.978 --> 46:30.778
Looks like you
sent the text just

46:30.846 --> 46:32.313
about the time I showed up.

46:33.481 --> 46:34.349
Interesting.

46:35.784 --> 46:36.818
If I called this
number do you think

46:36.885 --> 46:39.187
I would get a
mutual acquaintance?

46:40.054 --> 46:41.422
It's just a guy I'm seeing.

46:44.659 --> 46:45.594
I'm sorry Vi.

46:48.063 --> 46:49.131
That wasn't nice.

46:50.297 --> 46:51.631
New Frank don't grab other
people's phones,

46:51.699 --> 46:53.001
that's ignorant.

46:55.469 --> 46:58.072
But the truth is,
once in a while,

46:59.440 --> 47:01.208
if new Frank gets
bent out of shape,

47:01.275 --> 47:03.210
that means bad temper shit,

47:03.277 --> 47:05.212
and old Frank can
suddenly reappear.

47:07.148 --> 47:08.016
Out of nowhere.

47:09.217 --> 47:11.954
And if old Frank gets
into a foul mood,

47:13.253 --> 47:16.090
there's really nothing new
Frank can do to calm him down.

47:19.527 --> 47:24.532
Now let's talk about
our mutual acquaintance.

47:26.601 --> 47:28.637
And let's try not to
make old Frank mad.

47:37.711 --> 47:38.545
<i>He left.</i>

47:38.612 --> 47:40.781
Where's he been all this time?

47:40.849 --> 47:43.051
<i>Recovering
from the accident.</i>

47:43.851 --> 47:45.452
<i>He wanted to know where you were</i>

47:45.519 --> 47:46.954
<i>and I said that you left town</i>

47:47.021 --> 47:48.590
<i>and that I didn't
have an address.</i>

47:49.891 --> 47:52.327
<i>I can't talk right now.</i>

47:54.795 --> 47:56.163
<i>Meet me at hip hop class.</i>

47:57.498 --> 47:58.366
Sure.

48:00.335 --> 48:01.168
Fuck.

48:22.456 --> 48:25.793
<i>Hi, this is
Vi, I can't talk right now, bye.</i>

49:01.963 --> 49:03.298
Mrs. Comstock?

49:08.369 --> 49:11.673
I'm sorry to show
up without calling.

49:12.606 --> 49:14.076
I didn't have your number.

49:16.510 --> 49:19.279
Look, if you're busy, I'll just
say hello and be on my way.

49:19.347 --> 49:22.150
I wouldn't dream of it.
You just come right on in.

49:23.483 --> 49:25.286
So what brings
you down this way?

49:26.221 --> 49:28.322
Oh, it's on my way to
visit a friend from school

49:28.389 --> 49:31.392
and I took a little detour
because I wanted to talk to you.

49:31.458 --> 49:34.261
Well I'm just tickled
that you thought of me,

49:35.362 --> 49:37.397
especially with the
baby coming so soon.

49:37.465 --> 49:39.668
I'm not due for
another month or so.

49:41.235 --> 49:42.502
But you're good to travel?

49:42.570 --> 49:44.172
Yeah, short road trips.

49:44.239 --> 49:45.874
I'll be back in
Portland by Monday.

49:48.242 --> 49:50.443
I think maybe we need
some refreshments.

49:50.510 --> 49:52.313
Why don't I make some ice tea?

49:52.380 --> 49:53.614
Oh, please, don't
go to any trouble.

49:53.681 --> 49:54.682
It's no trouble at all,

49:54.748 --> 49:56.449
please make yourself
comfortable.

49:56.516 --> 49:57.317
Okay.

49:57.385 --> 49:57.885
I'll be right back.

49:57.952 --> 49:59.121
All right.

50:19.673 --> 50:21.543
Oh God, oh God.

50:22.010 --> 50:25.278
Oh God, oh God.

50:25.346 --> 50:27.815
Oh God, oh God.

50:30.284 --> 50:31.152
Okay.

50:32.786 --> 50:33.654
Okay.

50:35.623 --> 50:37.224
Do you take sugar?

50:38.458 --> 50:40.560
No, cut down on that.

50:40.628 --> 50:41.630
Doctor's orders.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.768
And then after all those years

50:48.835 --> 50:53.807
of us just living our
lives, he was gone.

50:56.010 --> 50:56.978
It was like the angel of death

50:57.043 --> 51:01.315
just swooped down,
for what reason,

51:01.382 --> 51:02.617
maybe God knows, I don't.

51:07.322 --> 51:09.291
I'm so sorry for your loss.

51:10.992 --> 51:13.862
Tom was very kind to me.

51:18.333 --> 51:19.201
You married?

51:22.336 --> 51:23.605
I'm sorry, that was rude.

51:25.739 --> 51:26.740
No it's okay.

51:28.643 --> 51:30.579
No, I'm not married.

51:32.980 --> 51:34.148
I'm sure you have plans,

51:34.215 --> 51:36.851
but would you consider
staying for dinner?

51:36.918 --> 51:39.554
I don't get many visitors,
especially young people.

51:40.987 --> 51:42.822
That's very sweet of you.

51:42.889 --> 51:44.893
No really, I'd
appreciate the company.

51:46.626 --> 51:48.663
Yeah, sure, why not?

51:48.730 --> 51:51.666
My friends not expecting
me till tomorrow.

51:51.733 --> 51:53.467
Do you have far to go?

51:53.534 --> 51:55.903
Yes, but I'm staying
in a motel tonight.

51:57.105 --> 51:59.240
Well then we can
talk in the kitchen.

52:00.375 --> 52:01.009
Great.

52:04.945 --> 52:06.346
I can't remember
the last time I had

52:06.414 --> 52:11.253
a home cooked meal like this,
everything was delicious.

52:11.552 --> 52:13.521
Most of it, straight
from the garden.

52:14.822 --> 52:15.956
Do you good to get
a little bit more

52:16.023 --> 52:18.992
of that in your diet
for the baby, you know.

52:19.059 --> 52:20.894
Yeah, you think so?

52:20.961 --> 52:22.530
Yes, ma'am. I mean...

52:23.831 --> 52:25.400
things you city folk eat.

52:27.534 --> 52:29.937
Raw fish wrapped in seaweed?

52:30.938 --> 52:32.373
Snails?

52:32.440 --> 52:33.675
Grubs we call them.

52:35.208 --> 52:36.810
I feel like if I didn't see it
on TV, I wouldn't believe it.

52:42.048 --> 52:44.351
Why don't we retire
to the living room?

52:46.153 --> 52:47.554
Are your feet cramping up?

52:47.621 --> 52:49.522
Its okay, you don't have to.

52:49.590 --> 52:54.429
You're tense, from your
ankles to your toes.

52:55.963 --> 52:57.631
Thanks.

52:57.697 --> 52:58.866
City life does that.

53:00.101 --> 53:00.802
Portland, right?

53:00.867 --> 53:03.503
Yeah, last few years.

53:03.570 --> 53:07.474
Detroit, before that I
was born in st. Louis.

53:09.076 --> 53:12.380
Well I lived my whole
life right here in Hadley,

53:12.447 --> 53:13.814
among the Druids

53:13.880 --> 53:15.115
Druids?

53:15.181 --> 53:19.853
Yes ma'am, hill people,
backward and ornery shit.

53:19.920 --> 53:21.955
Shoot as soon as look at ya.

53:22.023 --> 53:24.592
Marry their own
cousins, some of them.

53:28.862 --> 53:30.063
You city folk, you
think we're all

53:30.130 --> 53:33.434
just inbred morons, don't you?

53:37.472 --> 53:38.406
You got me there.

53:39.606 --> 53:44.478
Between work and the
baby, I've been on edge.

53:45.012 --> 53:47.015
Well, I understand completely.

53:50.650 --> 53:52.019
May I feel the baby?

54:06.166 --> 54:07.935
Do you believe in
an almighty God?

54:10.871 --> 54:11.772
Why do you ask?

54:14.175 --> 54:17.379
Well, recently I've been
stuck on the subject.

54:18.579 --> 54:20.448
Just want to know
your opinion on it.

54:25.219 --> 54:28.757
I don't really get
along with religion.

54:29.990 --> 54:31.025
Did you ever?

54:33.193 --> 54:34.961
When I was a a kid, maybe.

54:35.028 --> 54:39.666
Well kids believe what you
tell them, pretty much.

54:40.268 --> 54:42.670
Yeah, till they learn better.

54:45.239 --> 54:48.476
Well once life makes a
couple of wrong turns

54:48.543 --> 54:52.079
it takes an iron will
to keep believing.

54:54.215 --> 54:55.550
Do you agree with that?

54:58.952 --> 55:00.021
I talk to blunt.

55:00.987 --> 55:02.489
It's always been my problem.

55:04.157 --> 55:08.529
No, it's all good.

55:12.032 --> 55:13.701
What's the baby's daddy like?

55:20.708 --> 55:24.579
There I go again, the question
just popped into my head.

55:26.813 --> 55:29.884
Gone, I should have
known right away

55:29.951 --> 55:34.956
that it wasn't going to
work out, but I didn't.

55:36.690 --> 55:37.958
I figured as much.

55:40.360 --> 55:44.565
Tommy's daddy, we
never got along.

55:46.766 --> 55:49.971
But I got Tommy out of it, so.

55:54.208 --> 55:57.778
Sad to say, I could never
give him a brother or sister,

55:59.246 --> 56:01.815
my baby maker just
wasn't up to it.

57:27.168 --> 57:28.202
Oh.

57:30.838 --> 57:33.575
Dozed off, I'm so embarrassed.

57:35.242 --> 57:38.012
No wonder, you had a long day.

57:38.079 --> 57:39.380
Yeah.

57:39.447 --> 57:40.815
Left right after work.

57:40.882 --> 57:43.585
Probably should've gotten
a good night's sleep first.

57:45.152 --> 57:46.854
Why don't you stay over?

57:47.987 --> 57:49.590
Get a fresh start
in the morning.

57:51.324 --> 57:53.192
I don't want to impose.

57:53.260 --> 57:54.428
Oh, it's no trouble.

57:54.494 --> 57:55.661
I'll make up the guest
room, take a minute.

57:55.728 --> 57:58.831
Actually, do you mind
if I sleep on the couch?

57:58.898 --> 58:01.735
That way I could leave early
without disturbing you.

58:02.869 --> 58:04.337
Sure you'll be
comfortable there?

58:04.405 --> 58:07.173
Absolutely, if I hadn't
heard you come in,

58:07.240 --> 58:08.942
I'd probably still be asleep.

58:09.009 --> 58:11.211
Okay, I'll get you a pillow.

58:11.277 --> 58:12.145
Thank you.

58:14.949 --> 58:16.349
<i>Hi, this is Vi.</i>

58:16.416 --> 58:18.286
<i>I can't talk right now, bye.</i>

58:23.423 --> 58:25.224
Is everything okay?

58:25.291 --> 58:27.460
Yeah, just a problem at work.

58:27.527 --> 58:29.730
I'll deal with it
in the morning.

58:29.797 --> 58:31.097
I made you some tea.

58:31.164 --> 58:33.367
Oh, thank you.

58:34.201 --> 58:35.903
It's chamomile.

58:35.969 --> 58:39.106
Oh that's so kind
of you, thank you.

58:43.244 --> 58:45.144
It'll put you right to sleep.

58:45.211 --> 58:46.179
Okay then.

58:47.347 --> 58:49.783
Listen, if you hear
me rattling around

58:49.849 --> 58:51.451
the house in the
middle of the night,

58:51.518 --> 58:52.853
don't pay any attention

58:53.788 --> 58:54.789
I'm a light sleeper.

58:55.489 --> 58:56.757
Okay.

59:42.603 --> 59:44.005
Rise and shine.

59:45.239 --> 59:47.173
It's a muscle relaxant,

59:47.240 --> 59:48.208
I used to give it to Tommy

59:48.275 --> 59:50.278
when he seized up,
it'll wear off.

59:53.847 --> 59:54.514
What?

59:54.581 --> 59:55.849
My daddy was constable.

59:57.016 --> 59:58.852
He dealt with all
sorts of criminals.

59:59.987 --> 01:00:01.389
What sort of criminal are you?

01:00:02.623 --> 01:00:04.090
I'm not.

01:00:04.157 --> 01:00:06.793
Well you came here to hide.

01:00:07.862 --> 01:00:09.463
People are after you.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.165
You thought you'd be safe here.

01:00:12.967 --> 01:00:14.067
What?

01:00:14.134 --> 01:00:15.001
No.

01:00:16.469 --> 01:00:17.270
It doesn't matter now,

01:00:17.338 --> 01:00:18.873
all that matters is you're here

01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:21.074
and here you'll be safe so.

01:00:22.141 --> 01:00:23.143
Potty break time.

01:00:24.177 --> 01:00:25.978
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:00:26.045 --> 01:00:27.079
You insane?

01:00:27.146 --> 01:00:28.114
Let me out of these.

01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:30.884
No, no, and no.

01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:36.056
There you go sweetie.

01:00:38.525 --> 01:00:41.427
I got a chill the first
time I heard about you.

01:00:41.494 --> 01:00:42.429
Call it an omen.

01:00:43.764 --> 01:00:46.901
But then Tommy was gone so fast,
nothing else, mattered.

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:51.003
Then your picture arrived

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.440
and I realized God
works in strange.

01:00:58.311 --> 01:01:00.047
Come on, eat your breakfast.

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:02.916
I'm not hungry.

01:01:04.652 --> 01:01:07.789
Maybe your baby's hungry, did
you ever think about that?

01:01:10.056 --> 01:01:11.224
Explain something to me.

01:01:12.659 --> 01:01:14.360
With all the men out
there in the world,

01:01:14.427 --> 01:01:19.199
why would you take up
with a simple country boy?

01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:22.869
The baby's father is a thief.

01:01:24.103 --> 01:01:27.040
We lived together for a
while, but I left him.

01:01:28.608 --> 01:01:31.077
He thinks I took
stuff, stuff he stole.

01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:34.948
So he's holding my
best friend hostage.

01:01:39.052 --> 01:01:41.489
Well, I don't know about that.

01:01:42.389 --> 01:01:44.291
I know two things.

01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:45.226
You're in trouble.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:49.329
And you were delivered
to me so I could protect

01:01:49.396 --> 01:01:53.300
Tommy's baby and that's
exactly what I'm gonna do.

01:01:53.367 --> 01:01:56.135
Lady, it's not his goddamn kid.

01:01:56.202 --> 01:01:57.403
You can curse all you want.

01:01:57.471 --> 01:01:59.273
It's not going to
change my mind.

01:02:00.206 --> 01:02:03.411
Your drugs are okay,
but the food is shit.

01:02:10.985 --> 01:02:12.286
You gonna shoot me?

01:02:13.353 --> 01:02:14.254
Kill the baby?

01:02:15.556 --> 01:02:17.423
Well, you can still have a baby

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:20.427
with a foot full of buckshot,
just hurt a lot more.

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:23.965
You're insane.

01:02:25.065 --> 01:02:25.932
Maybe.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:27.968
But I got the gun.

01:02:39.278 --> 01:02:40.181
Get on the bed.

01:02:45.418 --> 01:02:47.153
Put those around your ankles.

01:02:47.387 --> 01:02:49.021
Put those around your ankles,

01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:50.657
what are you suddenly
hard of hearing?

01:03:01.034 --> 01:03:01.902
Fuck you.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.241
My daddy told me never to point

01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:12.512
a loaded gun unless
I intended to use it.

01:03:30.731 --> 01:03:32.300
I never touched your son.

01:03:35.135 --> 01:03:37.605
You know, all this is
happening for a reason.

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.106
I don't expect you to believe it

01:03:40.172 --> 01:03:43.442
because you don't believe
in anything but yourself.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:44.745
Not even a miracle,

01:03:44.811 --> 01:03:47.347
not even when it's
happening right inside you.

01:03:47.414 --> 01:03:50.317
I'm going to the market,
get you some nourishment.

01:03:50.384 --> 01:03:52.251
You may need this.

01:03:52.318 --> 01:03:53.987
What a thoughtful host.

01:03:55.621 --> 01:03:58.625
Well I'm so glad you're here.

01:04:19.746 --> 01:04:21.148
You've been busy.

01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:25.318
I keep getting messages,
please let me see them.

01:04:25.385 --> 01:04:26.620
He has my friend

01:04:36.329 --> 01:04:37.630
Is this for real?

01:04:42.536 --> 01:04:43.637
Jesus.

01:04:43.704 --> 01:04:44.572
What?

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.083
Does he know where I live?

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.117
I don't know.

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:58.786
Did this girl give
him my address?

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.489
No, she wouldn't do that.

01:05:02.556 --> 01:05:04.624
Look, we have to
get out of here.

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:07.394
If Frank finds us,
he'll slit our throats.

01:05:08.295 --> 01:05:09.628
Oh yeah?

01:05:09.695 --> 01:05:11.297
Well forewarned is fore-armed.

01:05:13.567 --> 01:05:15.869
You think you can handle Frank?

01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:18.138
Well, I refuse to believe
you were sent here

01:05:18.204 --> 01:05:20.440
to be slice up by some
murdering low life.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:22.641
Okay.

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:25.413
Okay, truth.

01:05:26.847 --> 01:05:32.053
I stole from him diamonds,
and jewelry and I hid it.

01:05:33.186 --> 01:05:34.788
If you let me go,
I'll split it with you

01:05:34.855 --> 01:05:37.157
and you can buy
yourself a castle.

01:05:38.324 --> 01:05:40.192
So first you say you
didn't take his stuff,

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.595
and now you say you did.

01:05:43.096 --> 01:05:45.465
You know what, I don't care
whether you did or you didn't.

01:05:46.733 --> 01:05:49.769
I don't want any part of
whatever it is you stole.

01:05:49.835 --> 01:05:52.271
We have to get out of here.

01:05:52.338 --> 01:05:54.273
We have to have dinner.

01:06:01.614 --> 01:06:04.417
He's going to cut us up and
flush us down the toilet.

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:07.488
We'll see about that.

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.265
You gonna answer that?

01:06:18.331 --> 01:06:19.199
It's Grace.

01:06:20.666 --> 01:06:21.634
Talk to her later.

01:06:22.768 --> 01:06:24.537
You really believe
all this is fated.

01:06:27.507 --> 01:06:29.309
I believe there is a plan

01:06:30.376 --> 01:06:32.779
and that each one of
us has a part in it.

01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:38.652
And your son, was he
meant to die so young?

01:06:38.719 --> 01:06:39.519
Can't say.

01:06:40.786 --> 01:06:42.255
Then how do you know what
you're doing is right?

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.461
The same way I knew I was right

01:06:48.527 --> 01:06:51.131
when they pulled
Tommy out of the pond.

01:06:51.931 --> 01:06:54.767
They thought he was gone
and I refused to accept it.

01:06:56.902 --> 01:06:59.371
Just because we don't
understand a master plan

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:00.807
doesn't mean there isn't one.

01:07:05.512 --> 01:07:06.780
Did you drug me again?

01:07:08.614 --> 01:07:09.482
Half dosage.

01:07:14.688 --> 01:07:16.390
You need a bath.

01:07:17.056 --> 01:07:19.391
You're making a big mistake.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:22.730
Yeah well, we both
made mistakes.

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:25.699
Not much I can do about
mine at this point,

01:07:25.766 --> 01:07:29.302
but I'm doing the best
I can to fix yours.

01:07:32.706 --> 01:07:34.774
Well, you know, at your
age, it's hard to say,

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.846
but you don't get that many
chances to make life work out.

01:07:41.581 --> 01:07:44.585
From what I can tell you've
used up most of yours.

01:07:48.655 --> 01:07:50.724
I thought God made
everything right.

01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:55.929
No, we're free to mess up.

01:07:56.862 --> 01:08:00.400
I know that from personal
experience, I took a wrong turn.

01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:04.771
It's funny though,

01:08:04.838 --> 01:08:08.309
I can't say I regret it.

01:08:22.956 --> 01:08:23.921
Didn't you hear me calling?

01:08:23.988 --> 01:08:25.524
Is everything all right?

01:08:25.591 --> 01:08:26.759
I was in the basement.

01:08:44.042 --> 01:08:45.310
Well, I just wanted
to let you know

01:08:45.377 --> 01:08:48.846
there was some guy at
the end of your driveway.

01:08:48.913 --> 01:08:49.783
You recognize them?

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:50.718
No.

01:08:55.055 --> 01:08:58.024
He was probably
lost or something.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.959
Well, if I see him
again, I'll let you know.

01:09:00.024 --> 01:09:00.792
Thanks.

01:09:02.028 --> 01:09:04.298
Are you still
taking your medication?

01:09:05.599 --> 01:09:07.533
Of course, doctor's orders.

01:09:09.469 --> 01:09:10.868
Look, I'm in the
middle of cleaning,

01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:11.837
how about I stop by tomorrow?

01:09:59.519 --> 01:10:01.154
You, weren't paying attention,

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.323
there's a backstairs
off the kitchen.

01:10:08.694 --> 01:10:10.730
I think the baby.

01:10:12.865 --> 01:10:16.470
No, I don't think it's your
time yet, but we'll see.

01:10:34.587 --> 01:10:36.923
<i>I think I saw
the same car on your driveway.</i>

01:10:54.274 --> 01:10:56.009
Please, I'm not gonna.

01:10:56.076 --> 01:10:57.610
No, you're not.

01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:04.451
Give me a minute.

01:11:07.287 --> 01:11:08.688
Can I help you?

01:11:08.755 --> 01:11:12.057
Good afternoon, Ma'am is this
the home of Tom Comstock?

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:13.059
Tom's my son.

01:11:14.627 --> 01:11:16.496
He's been dead
for some time now.

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:18.564
Sorry to hear that.

01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:22.001
I was looking forward
to meeting him.

01:11:23.069 --> 01:11:24.571
I guess that's not possible.

01:11:26.171 --> 01:11:28.509
Well, what can I do for you?

01:11:29.842 --> 01:11:31.778
Did you or your son
know this woman?

01:11:33.012 --> 01:11:36.649
She's my sister, she
disappeared several days ago.

01:11:36.716 --> 01:11:40.887
Family's frantic, a friend
of hers gave us Tom's name,

01:11:40.953 --> 01:11:43.922
said he knew her and that
she might've gone to see him,

01:11:43.989 --> 01:11:45.525
but we didn't have a number.

01:11:47.927 --> 01:11:49.028
Is that you there?

01:11:49.095 --> 01:11:51.798
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

01:11:53.699 --> 01:11:55.868
Not much of a family
resemblance,

01:11:55.935 --> 01:11:57.603
don't mind my saying.

01:11:59.305 --> 01:12:00.573
She's my half sister.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:06.980
Okay, well she did
come by a while back.

01:12:07.046 --> 01:12:08.214
She was looking for Tom.

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:11.618
And then?

01:12:13.252 --> 01:12:16.555
She needed a place to
stay for a couple of days

01:12:16.622 --> 01:12:18.759
while their apartment
was getting fixed up.

01:12:19.993 --> 01:12:22.529
Tell you what, I think she's
in some kind of trouble.

01:12:23.363 --> 01:12:25.466
Yeah, she's got problems.

01:12:26.365 --> 01:12:27.868
Do you know where she went?

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:32.572
She's still here.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.042
She's upstairs.

01:12:36.342 --> 01:12:38.912
Sleeping, said she didn't
want to see anybody

01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:40.981
but seeing as your family.

01:12:45.051 --> 01:12:48.988
Tommy attracted
lots of young women.

01:12:49.055 --> 01:12:51.324
They came around
looking for him.

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:52.958
No kidding.

01:12:53.025 --> 01:12:55.561
Like stray cats in heat.

01:12:55.628 --> 01:12:56.896
He couldn't get rid of them.

01:12:58.898 --> 01:13:02.002
Ones that wouldn't
leave, I had to lock up.

01:13:05.771 --> 01:13:06.773
Your girl here,

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:11.211
you're welcome to take her.

01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:18.652
No, ma'am I'm afraid she's not.

01:13:33.298 --> 01:13:35.335
Well now we got a situation.

01:13:35.402 --> 01:13:37.170
Your pal was just here.

01:13:37.237 --> 01:13:40.206
I think I drove him
off, but I'm not sure.

01:13:59.324 --> 01:14:01.693
Got here as fast as I could.

01:14:01.761 --> 01:14:03.029
Got a little job here.

01:14:03.095 --> 01:14:03.963
Let's do it.

01:14:07.033 --> 01:14:09.769
She's in the house
with some old lady.

01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:12.573
Should be easy, but
we might to get ugly.

01:14:13.372 --> 01:14:14.740
Whatever it takes, bro.

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:18.644
Do you really have to smoke?

01:14:19.378 --> 01:14:21.582
It's fucking bad for you, man.

01:14:23.015 --> 01:14:25.786
Oh, fucking great,
burn down the woods.

01:14:37.162 --> 01:14:38.297
Got your toys?

01:14:39.498 --> 01:14:40.867
Looks like bed time.

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:05.391
See about a back door.

01:15:39.958 --> 01:15:40.993
Mrs. Comstock?

01:15:47.867 --> 01:15:49.902
Mrs. Comstock?

01:16:09.354 --> 01:16:12.791
You can gut the old
lady, but we need Alex alive.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.040
Wait here.

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:36.007
What?

01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:45.217
Frank, you okay?

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.320
Frank.

01:18:04.337 --> 01:18:05.205
Frank?

01:18:28.427 --> 01:18:29.296
Martha?

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:33.233
Martha?

01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:36.269
Did I hear a gunshot?

01:18:36.336 --> 01:18:39.239
Oh Grace, I got a situation.

01:18:40.206 --> 01:18:43.175
There's a woman upstairs,
she's gonna have a baby.

01:18:43.242 --> 01:18:45.244
She's that girl
from the accident,

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:47.612
she's having Tommy's baby.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.483
She showed up here out of
the blue with some story

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:53.386
about how she wanted to visit
with me and talk about Tommy.

01:18:53.453 --> 01:18:57.056
But she came here to hide,
there are people after her.

01:18:57.122 --> 01:18:58.623
So she's going to
have Tom's baby?

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:02.295
Yes, please, don't judge.

01:19:07.632 --> 01:19:09.001
Jesus.

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:12.538
Her water broke.

01:19:14.006 --> 01:19:15.140
I had no choice.

01:19:16.341 --> 01:19:18.944
It was the only way
to protect the baby.

01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:20.112
It all happened so fast,

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.447
you don't understand
what went on here.

01:19:21.514 --> 01:19:23.349
Two guys came here.

01:19:23.416 --> 01:19:24.550
They were going to kill her.

01:19:24.617 --> 01:19:25.485
What?

01:19:26.652 --> 01:19:29.021
Yeah, they're in the basement.

01:19:30.756 --> 01:19:31.625
They're dead.

01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:35.161
I killed them.

01:19:36.662 --> 01:19:38.097
We got to uncuff her.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.902
Get some towels.

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.105
Please, you have to help me,

01:19:47.172 --> 01:19:47.974
she's out of her mind.

01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:50.009
It's not Tom's kid, I swear.

01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:51.243
I believe you.

01:19:54.713 --> 01:19:56.149
I have to get out of here.

01:19:56.215 --> 01:19:59.185
Of course you will, but first
you're gonna have that baby.

01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:05.358
Let her legs free
for God's sake.

01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:09.462
Okay.

01:20:17.804 --> 01:20:18.939
Try to breath, try to breath.

01:20:21.073 --> 01:20:23.009
Oh God, it hurts.

01:20:23.076 --> 01:20:24.109
Breath, breath.

01:20:24.176 --> 01:20:25.677
Okay, okay.

01:20:25.744 --> 01:20:27.512
Come on, come
on, you can do it.

01:20:27.579 --> 01:20:29.081
You're gonna do it, come on.

01:20:29.148 --> 01:20:30.483
Okay, hang on.

01:20:31.783 --> 01:20:32.451
You got this.

01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:35.054
You got this, its coming.

01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:36.355
Push harder!

01:20:36.421 --> 01:20:38.656
Come on, you can
do it, you're doing it.

01:20:39.925 --> 01:20:41.560
One more, one more
and you've got a baby.

01:20:41.627 --> 01:20:43.629
- Breath, breath.
- One more.

01:20:43.695 --> 01:20:46.164
Okay, you did it, you did it.

01:20:50.103 --> 01:20:51.371
Oh look at you.

01:20:53.271 --> 01:20:54.106
You're perfect.

01:20:55.675 --> 01:20:59.545
You're so, you're
so, you're so....

01:20:59.612 --> 01:21:01.247
You need to rest.

01:21:03.115 --> 01:21:04.184
I'm so tired.

01:21:09.654 --> 01:21:11.358
You need to rest.

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:20.466
I have got to get
you out of here.

01:21:20.533 --> 01:21:22.369
Are you strong enough to walk?

01:21:24.136 --> 01:21:25.237
I think so.

01:21:25.305 --> 01:21:27.373
Okay, halfway down the
driveway there's a path

01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:29.240
that go straight to my house.

01:21:29.307 --> 01:21:30.510
You'll be safe there.

01:21:31.543 --> 01:21:32.310
What about?

01:21:32.377 --> 01:21:34.145
I'll take care of Martha.

01:21:47.326 --> 01:21:48.194
Where's the baby?

01:21:48.261 --> 01:21:49.429
I don't know.

01:21:53.565 --> 01:21:58.537
Grace!

01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:20.760
Grace!

01:22:22.595 --> 01:22:24.097
How could you?

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.233
How could you?

01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:33.605
Grace!

01:22:52.457 --> 01:22:53.425
Grace?

01:22:55.761 --> 01:22:57.764
You're going to
have to give up that baby.

01:23:00.565 --> 01:23:02.167
That's Tommy's baby.

01:23:03.601 --> 01:23:06.372
Tommy would still be alive
if it wasn't for that woman.

01:23:08.474 --> 01:23:09.641
That's my baby.

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:15.515
Martha, it's not Tom's
baby, you have to face that.

01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:19.685
It's my baby, it's my baby.

01:23:19.752 --> 01:23:21.587
You're going to have
to give him up.

01:23:21.654 --> 01:23:24.690
That woman had nothing
to do with Tom.

01:23:30.662 --> 01:23:31.630
Martha?

01:23:36.769 --> 01:23:38.271
Martha?

01:23:49.881 --> 01:23:52.184
The girl and the baby are gone.

01:23:55.954 --> 01:23:59.591
Go ahead, smash my
skull if you want.

01:24:02.828 --> 01:24:04.630
I'm sorry, Martha.

01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:21.847
I'm so sorry, Martha.

01:24:23.416 --> 01:24:25.016
I'm so sorry!

01:25:09.994 --> 01:25:13.733
You just wait here one
minute, one minute.

01:25:36.855 --> 01:25:38.657
It's been a long,
strange trip huh Alex?

01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:43.028
Feels like you packed on a
few pounds since we broke up.

01:25:44.697 --> 01:25:46.332
Your stuff is here, just take it

01:25:46.399 --> 01:25:47.800
Oh I plan on it.

01:25:50.069 --> 01:25:52.104
And you're gonna help
me get out of here.

01:25:52.171 --> 01:25:54.440
Because I'm not exactly
my best right now.

01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:57.609
That crazy bitch
still out there?

01:25:57.676 --> 01:25:58.578
I don't know.

01:26:01.646 --> 01:26:02.515
Come on.

01:26:04.649 --> 01:26:05.518
Come on.

01:26:07.787 --> 01:26:10.289
No, wait, please.

01:26:11.489 --> 01:26:12.791
Let's go.

01:26:12.858 --> 01:26:16.494
Stop, you got what you wanted,
what do you need me for?

01:26:16.561 --> 01:26:17.762
You're unfinished business baby.

01:26:17.829 --> 01:26:19.832
No stop!

01:26:23.469 --> 01:26:25.002
Stop Frank, no.

01:26:25.069 --> 01:26:26.037
Come on.

01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:27.539
I'm not going, I
just had our baby.

01:26:27.605 --> 01:26:30.775
Fucking bullshit, now shut up
and get in the car, come on.

01:26:32.645 --> 01:26:33.579
We're done frank.

01:27:02.707 --> 01:27:03.710
Frank, stop.

01:27:55.961 --> 01:27:56.896
The baby.

01:27:58.162 --> 01:27:59.164
It's safe.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.135
Where?

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:05.872
In the house.

01:28:49.814 --> 01:28:53.118
Alex! Dinner!

01:28:55.186 --> 01:28:58.524
Alexander? Dinner!

01:29:09.835 --> 01:29:12.770
What were you doing out there?

01:29:12.837 --> 01:29:13.805
Just playing mom.

01:29:15.039 --> 01:29:17.909
Okay, go wash up for dinner.

01:29:17.976 --> 01:29:18.743
Yes, Mom.

01:29:20.045 --> 01:29:21.247
What do you think he
does out there all alone?

01:29:23.082 --> 01:29:24.182
God only knows.
