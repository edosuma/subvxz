WEBVTT

00:01.140 --> 00:02.492
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:02.578 --> 00:04.148
Gentlemen to what do I
owe you this pleausre.

00:04.187 --> 00:06.263
And if it has anything
to do with that police officer,

00:06.265 --> 00:08.054
David Nelson, I can't help you.

00:08.117 --> 00:10.050
The senate is launching
an inquiry, James,

00:10.052 --> 00:12.085
into whether your church
and others like it

00:12.087 --> 00:14.688
are taking advantage
of your tax-exempt status.

00:14.690 --> 00:15.922
Where's Basie Skanks?

00:15.924 --> 00:17.657
One of the cops
who works around here told me

00:17.659 --> 00:21.479
about a 15-year-old girl
from the church.

00:22.464 --> 00:24.231
Nothin' happened to Danielle.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.499
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

00:25.501 --> 00:27.534
I know that she changed her story.

00:27.536 --> 00:29.469
Leave my family alone.

00:29.471 --> 00:30.704
He never did anything.

00:30.706 --> 00:32.238
So why did you say he raped you?

00:32.241 --> 00:35.675
Tell that little side piece
to stop textin' so damn much.

00:35.677 --> 00:36.810
How did you two meet?

00:36.812 --> 00:38.011
On our way to dinner,

00:38.013 --> 00:40.547
he pulled over
and asked me to marry him.

00:40.549 --> 00:41.648
We need to get help.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.850
- Like what, therapy?
- Yes.

00:43.852 --> 00:45.919
- Got some big news last night.
- Yeah, what about?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.487
Charity and I are havin' a baby.

00:47.489 --> 00:50.424
You said at dinner the day
that we buried faith

00:50.426 --> 00:52.325
that David Nelson never contacted you.

00:52.327 --> 00:53.827
He hadn't, as far as I know.

00:53.829 --> 00:55.996
I found a message on my phone
this morning from him saying

00:55.998 --> 00:58.065
that he tried reaching you
over and over again.

00:58.067 --> 00:59.867
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Nothin'.

01:01.170 --> 01:02.335
Pastor Greenleaf?

01:04.840 --> 01:06.206
Back the blue, huh?

01:06.208 --> 01:07.507
You could call it whatever you want.

01:07.509 --> 01:08.809
That was just the mayor's suggestion.

01:08.811 --> 01:11.445
What matters to him is
that at least one black church

01:11.447 --> 01:12.612
in Memphis show some support

01:12.614 --> 01:14.481
for the police in the midst of all this.

01:14.483 --> 01:15.749
And you're approaching calvary

01:15.751 --> 01:18.385
- because Nelson is on the roll?
- That's correct.

01:18.387 --> 01:20.520
We're not asking you
to honor officer Nelson

01:20.522 --> 01:21.688
specifically, of course.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.890
But if you could honor
the force in general

01:23.892 --> 01:25.492
and he could attend, well,

01:25.494 --> 01:26.793
the message would be clear enough

01:26.795 --> 01:28.428
for our purposes, anyway.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.531
You knew this is
what he'd come in here for?

01:31.533 --> 01:32.405
Mm.

01:36.902 --> 01:40.104
As I'm sure you know, bishop,
Triumph Church

01:40.106 --> 01:43.273
is hosting this protest
scheduled Friday night.

01:43.275 --> 01:44.942
That boy's mother wasn't even a member

01:44.944 --> 01:46.510
till after that boy was killed.

01:46.512 --> 01:47.911
We heard that as well.

01:47.913 --> 01:49.847
And I heard the Skanks went to her house

01:49.849 --> 01:51.448
and invited her personally.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.524
I believe that is correct.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.948
You don't find that cynical?

01:56.655 --> 01:58.655
The mayor doesn't find this cynical?

01:58.657 --> 02:00.357
The mayor thought, bishop,

02:00.359 --> 02:01.859
since pastor Skanks has made a point

02:01.861 --> 02:03.260
of calling you out publicly

02:03.262 --> 02:06.430
for not yet taking a stand
for or against David Nelson,

02:06.432 --> 02:08.699
you might see some advantage in this.

02:08.701 --> 02:10.317
Not enough of one yet.

02:11.370 --> 02:13.871
The mayor thought
that might be your assessment.

02:13.873 --> 02:15.363
So...

02:16.609 --> 02:17.868
And this is what?

02:18.577 --> 02:22.846
A plat map of Calvary's property
and the adjoining lot,

02:22.848 --> 02:25.749
currently held in trust
by Memphis redevelopment.

02:25.751 --> 02:27.751
They have an offer on the table.

02:27.753 --> 02:30.220
But I know Calvary's expressed
an interest in the past

02:30.222 --> 02:32.589
for a pool and community
center, I think.

02:32.591 --> 02:34.124
And the city said no.

02:34.126 --> 02:36.948
And the city is prepared
to change its mind,

02:37.630 --> 02:42.966
which makes this, we think,
a very exciting time.

02:45.571 --> 02:47.638
This Sunday would be great.

02:50.643 --> 02:52.029
Gentlemen.

02:52.945 --> 02:54.344
[Door opens]

02:55.981 --> 02:58.820
Basie Skanks ain't got no pool.

Go ahead, Daddy. Tell me my life.

03:57.476 --> 04:00.878
It's about to get better.
I gave some more thought

04:00.880 --> 04:02.846
about what you said
about officer Nelson.

04:03.249 --> 04:04.248
- Really?
- Give him a call.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.891
Have him come in.

04:06.852 --> 04:08.752
W... what changed your mind?

04:08.754 --> 04:11.822
Where were you when I laid
The Earth's foundations?

04:11.824 --> 04:13.300
Just have him come in.

04:13.926 --> 04:15.292
Today, if possible.

04:18.497 --> 04:20.293
You don't seem to want to be here.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.397
Am I wrong?

04:23.302 --> 04:24.220
Nope.

04:25.037 --> 04:27.325
But you came to therapy anyway.

04:27.773 --> 04:28.607
Why?

04:29.475 --> 04:31.175
Because she would have made
my life a livin' hell

04:31.177 --> 04:32.247
if I didn't.

04:33.710 --> 04:34.759
You just can't seem to agree

04:34.761 --> 04:36.761
about what kind
of a relationship you wanna have

04:36.763 --> 04:38.736
while you stay married.

04:40.136 --> 04:41.904

04:52.372 --> 04:54.179
You have extramarital affairs?

04:56.984 --> 04:58.789
I'll take that as a yes.

Uh, the prayer requests. I'm sorry.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.507
Oh, no need to apologize.

05:22.509 --> 05:24.242
Uh, we'll get you in there next week.

05:24.244 --> 05:27.979
- It's all good.
- Okay. What can I do for you?

05:28.134 --> 05:30.315
I'm a little embarrassed
to ask for your help with this.

05:30.317 --> 05:33.552
Um, there's a small office back
where outreach ends

05:33.554 --> 05:35.287
and accounting begins, near the...

05:35.289 --> 05:37.155
the one with all the hymnals
in the boxes.

05:41.691 --> 05:43.028

05:43.030 --> 05:44.529
Oh. You want that office.

05:44.531 --> 05:46.631
Unless the hymnals need it more.

05:46.633 --> 05:48.233
Well, you know,
that's not my purview, really.

05:48.235 --> 05:53.638
Well, you are a Greenleaf.
So you would know who to ask.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.740
I don't know who to talk to, actually.

05:55.742 --> 05:59.811
Well, uh, Darlene.
Uh, she's the office manager.

05:59.813 --> 06:01.885
Okay. I'll ask her.

06:02.482 --> 06:03.882
Only if you feel it's deserved.

06:03.884 --> 06:05.217
- All right.
- All right.

- Hey. who's drivin' by?
- Oh.

06:40.243 --> 06:41.586
Uh, somebody lost.

06:41.883 --> 06:43.654
We have, like, three oak mill
roads around here.

06:43.994 --> 06:47.050
Happens a lot. No big deal. What's up?

06:48.331 --> 06:50.459
- You have a second?
- Yeah.

06:52.795 --> 06:53.564
So if you can prove

06:53.567 --> 06:55.133
that the girl's
second statement was false,

06:55.135 --> 06:56.868
you can get a D.A. To reopen the case?

06:56.870 --> 06:58.083
Maybe.

06:58.201 --> 07:01.706
There has to be what's called
a "change of circumstance."

07:02.139 --> 07:03.402
who told you that?

07:04.234 --> 07:05.713
I did some research.

07:07.882 --> 07:08.712
How can I help?

07:09.138 --> 07:10.842
Well, I assume there's
some security cameras

07:10.844 --> 07:11.883
out at blue basin.

took her there on April 7th.

to look at the archive footage,

07:19.192 --> 07:20.725

at one point in time.
- Really?

08:02.259 --> 08:04.438
When did you ever consider
joining the force, Daddy?

08:04.440 --> 08:07.124
Oh, not in Memphis.
This is back in little rock.

08:07.126 --> 08:10.215
My point is, the same desire animates

08:10.217 --> 08:12.880

08:13.580 --> 08:15.010

08:15.281 --> 08:17.330
Well, it wasn't a choice.

what you said you was gonna do.

and pool.

we got on that thing.

11:31.845 --> 11:33.477
[Scoffs] A mistake.

11:33.479 --> 11:34.727
Yeah.

11:39.752 --> 11:42.103
Have you ever made a mistake?

11:42.989 --> 11:44.903
A mistake as big as this?

11:46.326 --> 11:47.768
Yeah. I have.

12:01.474 --> 12:02.773
- Have you seen Grace?
- Grace?

12:02.775 --> 12:04.475
- Over there.
- Thank you.

12:19.726 --> 12:21.425
You should get home.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.510
It's late.

12:24.297 --> 12:26.130
I'm never goin' back there.

12:26.132 --> 12:27.365
You'll leave kerissa?

12:27.367 --> 12:28.319
Maybe.

12:29.002 --> 12:29.909
[Scoffs]

12:30.169 --> 12:32.101
You'll never get divorced.

12:33.039 --> 12:34.605
So what are you doing with me?

12:38.478 --> 12:40.109
We're having fun.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.212
Go home.

12:48.554 --> 12:49.887
Go home.

12:56.562 --> 12:57.995
Amen.

12:57.997 --> 13:01.198
We have a couple of dozen cops
on the rolls already, dear.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.566
This didn't come outta nowhere.

13:02.568 --> 13:03.678
Oh, no.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.436
It came from somewhere.

13:05.438 --> 13:08.706
I know exactly
where it came from... Grace.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.534
Grace had nothin' to do with this.

13:10.777 --> 13:12.043
The mayor's office called Mac.

13:12.838 --> 13:14.011
It's not like we don't benefit

13:14.013 --> 13:15.713
from the bravery of these people.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.118
And what if it was Jacob?

13:20.019 --> 13:21.452
What if it was Jacob, James?

13:21.454 --> 13:23.669
This hero shot down in cold blood?

13:24.157 --> 13:27.024
Would you still be rushin'
to hang blue banners

13:27.026 --> 13:28.960
on the cross like this, would you?

13:28.962 --> 13:29.870
No.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.807
Because he is somebody's son.

13:34.267 --> 13:35.334
I'm aware.

13:35.535 --> 13:37.802
But that doesn't mean
that an objective person

13:37.804 --> 13:40.571
couldn't see both sides
of the situation.

13:45.545 --> 13:46.944
You know, I never thought I'd say this,

13:46.946 --> 13:49.276
but thank god for the deacons' board.

13:49.664 --> 13:50.407
Why?

13:50.409 --> 13:52.316
Because they'll never let you do this.

13:52.318 --> 13:55.553
[Laughs] The deacons don't run
this church.

13:57.190 --> 13:58.180
You're right.

13:59.058 --> 14:00.524
God does.

14:01.527 --> 14:03.027
But obviously you're not in the mood

14:03.029 --> 14:04.462
to listen to him, either.

14:10.470 --> 14:13.740
Don't these protests have
a habit of turning into riots?

14:14.148 --> 14:15.873
Yeah. I'm sure there'll be
a ton of cops.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.475
Oh, I'm sure there'll be
a ton of cops there, too.

14:17.477 --> 14:18.716
That's what I'm worried about.

14:18.878 --> 14:20.812
Mom, lots of kids from school are going.

14:21.514 --> 14:23.114
Do you know the facts of the Case?

14:23.116 --> 14:25.750
I know an innocent kid is dead.

14:25.752 --> 14:26.804
Mm-hmm.

14:27.587 --> 14:29.644
What if the cop is innocent, too?

14:30.590 --> 14:32.084
This isn't a vigil, honey.

14:32.825 --> 14:34.558
They're calling for a grand jury.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.694
This man could go to jail
for an honest mistake.

14:36.696 --> 14:38.629
Do you really wanna be a part
of makin' that happen?

14:38.631 --> 14:40.297
Are you saying I can't go?

14:40.299 --> 14:42.549
If it was a vigil, like I said,
that would be one thing.

14:42.551 --> 14:46.582
But... Yeah.

14:47.306 --> 14:48.646
I guess I am.

14:49.642 --> 14:50.822
Okay.

14:52.278 --> 14:53.551
I'm sorry.

14:54.781 --> 14:56.702
I have to finish my homework.

14:58.351 --> 15:01.039
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. I heard you.

15:02.121 --> 15:03.654
Shut my door, please.

15:06.426 --> 15:09.393
Yeah.

15:12.832 --> 15:13.942
[Exhales]

15:15.742 --> 15:17.226
So do you need a ride for tonight?

15:18.338 --> 15:20.401
- I can't come.
- Why not?

15:20.537 --> 15:22.537
Her mom thinks it's too dangerous.

15:22.539 --> 15:24.026
Too dangerous or too ghetto?

15:24.244 --> 15:26.478
Morris, you can't say
ghetto dressed like that.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.014
- [Laughter]
- It's my school uniform.

15:29.016 --> 15:30.415
Too dangerous.

15:30.899 --> 15:32.951
So your mom thinks
it's more dangerous to protest

15:32.953 --> 15:35.063
than it is to let
a state-sponsored killer

15:35.118 --> 15:37.068
like David Nelson go unpunished?

15:37.821 --> 15:39.972
Honestly, I don't know
what my mom thinks.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.499
Well, what do you think?

15:41.959 --> 15:45.219
I know what I think... you had options.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.562
[Both laugh] See ya.

15:48.665 --> 15:50.599
[Sighs]

15:57.207 --> 15:58.707
He's not even full-time.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.175
He just spends all this time here

16:00.177 --> 16:01.943
since he got fired from that frame shop.

16:01.945 --> 16:03.178
But if the office is empty...

16:03.180 --> 16:05.552
It's not. It's full of hymnals.

16:07.017 --> 16:08.149
Why are you being like this?

16:08.151 --> 16:09.551
Why are you?

16:09.553 --> 16:12.454
Grace, you don't owe
that clown an office.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.744
Just tell him to leave you be.

16:15.459 --> 16:18.040
Well, god loves him. You don't have to.

16:20.130 --> 16:21.763
Hey. Can I speak with you for a second?

16:21.765 --> 16:23.932
Hey. Yeah. Come in.

16:23.934 --> 16:25.867
- Darlene.
- Good morning, brother Kendall.

16:29.306 --> 16:32.340
- So you saw the security footage.
- I did.

16:32.342 --> 16:34.427
He was there the day
she said he took her there.

16:34.678 --> 16:37.078
So that proves that Mac's been
doing all the things that we...

16:37.080 --> 16:39.447
Yeah. But you can't see if
anybody else was in the car.

16:39.449 --> 16:41.282
And he had plenty of reason to go there.

16:41.284 --> 16:42.584
It's church property.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.380
There's a lake. He likes to fish.

16:44.755 --> 16:47.122
It's not the silver bullet
you were lookin' for.

16:47.124 --> 16:48.059
I'm sorry.

16:50.160 --> 16:50.959
What's that?

16:51.305 --> 16:53.328
Remember the truck you heard
me talkin' about yesterday,

16:53.330 --> 16:54.996
the one that drove
by the gate a few times?

16:54.998 --> 16:56.031
Yeah. The lost guy.

16:56.033 --> 16:58.099
Yeah. He came back.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.267
who was it?

16:59.269 --> 17:00.535
We don't know.

17:00.537 --> 17:01.970
He just sat there for a few minutes.

17:01.972 --> 17:03.494
And then he drove away.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.164
But he left this behind.

17:06.510 --> 17:07.371
What is it?

17:09.311 --> 17:10.679
Pictures of faith.

17:49.219 --> 17:50.874
You told anyone else?

17:52.989 --> 17:55.079
No. Not yet.

18:10.974 --> 18:13.913
Just when you think things
can't get any worse.

18:15.712 --> 18:17.321
Whoever did this wants money.

18:17.647 --> 18:20.181
I assume. There's a number.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.816
- We should call the police.
- Mnh-mnh.

18:21.818 --> 18:23.128
I don't wanna do that.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.089
Not yet, anyway.

18:26.456 --> 18:27.337
Why?

18:29.726 --> 18:31.514
'Cause I wanna talk to him.

18:35.132 --> 18:36.577
And how did it make you feel

18:36.900 --> 18:39.441
when you heard the story about
how the deacons got together?

18:39.936 --> 18:43.477
Sad... Because we had love once.

18:44.508 --> 18:46.391
at least I think we did. I did.

18:49.679 --> 18:51.212
And how did it make you feel?

18:51.214 --> 18:53.715
Oof. He was too drunk to care.

18:53.717 --> 18:56.391
Kerissa, let Jacob answer.

18:58.288 --> 19:01.556
Jacob, I know that some feelings
can be scary to express

19:01.558 --> 19:04.626
because we're afraid
it'll blow up our whole lives.

19:04.628 --> 19:05.994
But Jesus wasn't joking

19:05.996 --> 19:08.879
when he said the truth
will set you free.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.833
How did you feel
when you heard the deacons talk

19:11.835 --> 19:13.668
about how much they loved each other?

19:16.640 --> 19:19.574
[Scoffs] It's like being
married to a 6-year-old.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.176
Say something!

19:30.587 --> 19:33.561
[Chuckles] It was a fuel leak.

19:33.990 --> 19:36.324
There was no intention
to deliberately insult the man.

19:36.326 --> 19:38.793
When senator banks
mentions being insulted,

19:38.795 --> 19:41.830
he doesn't mean just
one missed lunch in Nashville.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.364
We haven't sent his office

19:43.366 --> 19:45.674
any of the documentation they asked for.

19:47.003 --> 19:48.714
We're not legally required.

19:49.072 --> 19:50.972
As of this moment, we are.

19:50.974 --> 19:51.969
What's going on?

19:52.475 --> 19:53.865
We're being audited.

19:57.881 --> 19:59.010
[Chuckles]

20:02.819 --> 20:05.209
Are you as lost as I am?
Please tell me you are.

20:05.789 --> 20:06.944
I wanna go downtown.

20:07.157 --> 20:09.457
- To the protest?
- Yeah.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.613
It's just too stupid
that we're not there.

20:12.596 --> 20:15.908
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

20:16.454 --> 20:18.032
S... somewhere being a drag.

20:19.736 --> 20:22.491
Well, Jesus healed on the sabbath.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.007
I don't know what that means.

20:26.009 --> 20:27.542
It's easier to ask for forgiveness

20:27.544 --> 20:29.043
than it is to get permission.

20:29.512 --> 20:31.436
Mark, chapter three, verse five.

20:41.658 --> 20:46.194
[Inhales deeply, exhales slowly]

20:46.196 --> 20:47.829
[Tapping buttons]

20:52.002 --> 20:53.026
Man: <i> Yeah?</i>

20:54.404 --> 20:55.904
Is this the person
who left The Flash drive

20:55.906 --> 20:57.872
- outside of Greenleaf?
<i>-who's asking?</i>

20:57.874 --> 20:59.950
Her sister. How did you know her?

21:01.845 --> 21:05.613
<i>Everybody knew faith,
some better than others.</i>

21:07.884 --> 21:09.168
How much do you want?

21:10.453 --> 21:11.743
<i>5 grand.</i>

21:16.128 --> 21:17.392
Where can we meet?

21:17.394 --> 21:18.893
<i>Oh, we're not meetin' anywhere, bitch.</i>

21:18.895 --> 21:20.194
<i>I'm gonna tell you
where to drop the cash...</i>

21:20.196 --> 21:21.335
listen to me.

21:21.932 --> 21:25.400
You want the money?
You tell me where to be.

21:26.393 --> 21:29.060
Bishop, it is with a heavy heart

21:29.103 --> 21:30.202
that I pitch my tent

21:30.204 --> 21:32.716
across from yours
in the field of battle.

21:33.541 --> 21:36.542
Lord knows we have been
comrades in many a fight.

21:36.544 --> 21:37.943
Deacon Sykes, can we...

21:37.945 --> 21:41.180
No. You started something here, pastor.

21:41.182 --> 21:42.611
You're gonna let me finish.

21:43.451 --> 21:46.490
- Go ahead.
- I prized your counsel.

21:47.054 --> 21:51.056
But when you decided to invite
the police to our church

21:51.058 --> 21:54.126
without so much
as consulting the deacons...

21:54.128 --> 21:56.528
Connie, I called this meeting.

21:56.530 --> 21:58.118
After the fact.

21:58.866 --> 22:02.468
You flouted the law of god.

22:02.470 --> 22:04.770
The church has deacons for a reason...

22:04.772 --> 22:06.738
checks and balances.

22:07.241 --> 22:09.742
You seem to be only interested
in the checks.

22:09.744 --> 22:12.507
Well, the good news is,

22:13.547 --> 22:15.047
I don't have to answer to you.

22:15.049 --> 22:16.491
Don't you want to?

22:16.884 --> 22:19.531
Aren't we all in this together?

22:21.555 --> 22:24.924
Basie Skanks is speaking
at that protest tonight

22:24.926 --> 22:27.194
on behalf of the innocent.

22:27.862 --> 22:30.496
Doesn't that sound
like what a follower of Jesus

22:30.498 --> 22:32.631
ought to be gettin' up to in this mess?

22:32.633 --> 22:35.881
Connie, the man
is a member of our church.

22:36.804 --> 22:38.470
And from the time I've spent with him,

22:38.472 --> 22:40.572
I've understood him to be a good man

22:40.574 --> 22:42.002
who made a mistake.

22:43.044 --> 22:45.857
Bishop, if you go through with this

22:46.447 --> 22:49.949
and let those ruffians
parade up and down the aisles

22:49.951 --> 22:53.113
of our church with guns at their sides,

22:53.521 --> 22:56.249
I am gonna stand up
in the middle of service

22:56.624 --> 22:58.464
and walk right out

22:58.759 --> 23:02.161
and invite every other Christian
to follow me.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.775
That is your prerogative.

23:18.879 --> 23:20.721
I stand by my decision.

23:31.559 --> 23:33.726
[Exhales]

23:45.973 --> 23:47.673
Mm.

23:58.519 --> 23:59.409
Mama?

23:59.754 --> 24:01.120
Yes, baby?

24:01.756 --> 24:03.697
Can I bother you a second?

24:04.859 --> 24:06.525
You're not botherin' me. Come on.

24:06.527 --> 24:08.560
[Chuckles]

24:15.469 --> 24:18.448
- Look at faith.
- Yeah.

24:22.843 --> 24:24.527
I've got some good news.

24:25.546 --> 24:26.745
Well, an angel must have sent you

24:26.747 --> 24:29.089
'cause I could certainly use some.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.477
I'm gonna have a baby.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.506
That's wonderful.

24:42.463 --> 24:43.305
Yeah.

24:44.598 --> 24:45.352
Oh.

24:48.335 --> 24:49.969
That's such good news.

24:51.605 --> 24:54.073
Such good news.

25:05.886 --> 25:07.486
Remember when I went to Macy's last week

25:07.488 --> 25:08.902
to buy you that scarf?

25:09.423 --> 25:10.318
Mm-hmm.

25:10.758 --> 25:13.025
The security guard followed me
around the whole time.

25:15.696 --> 25:17.656
Then, the sales clerk,

25:18.099 --> 25:19.961
so busy flirtin' with me,

25:21.102 --> 25:22.384
she couldn't even ring me up.

25:22.670 --> 25:24.269
Are you tryin' to make me jealous?

25:24.271 --> 25:24.880
No.

25:25.639 --> 25:28.173
[Chuckles]

25:28.175 --> 25:31.074
What I'm tryin' to say
is to both those people,

25:31.912 --> 25:33.160
I'm just a body.

25:34.715 --> 25:37.425
- Yeah?
- I'm not a person.

25:38.052 --> 25:40.519
And then when I asked you
what you were doin' with me

25:40.521 --> 25:42.601
when you knew I'd never leave kerissa,

25:43.257 --> 25:45.288
and you said, "having fun,"

25:47.128 --> 25:49.094
that just made me feel
like I was nothing

25:49.096 --> 25:50.715
but a body to you, too.

25:52.566 --> 25:55.067
I know I'll probably never
leave kerissa.

25:55.069 --> 25:56.905
But I wish I could.

25:57.838 --> 26:01.729
And I guess I just wish
you wish I could, too.

26:03.244 --> 26:04.353
I do.

26:05.246 --> 26:07.169
I do.

26:07.915 --> 26:10.382
But that it doesn't mean
it doesn't hurt to hear

26:10.384 --> 26:13.952
you jackin' off your ego,
saying things out loud

26:13.954 --> 26:17.377
that you never intend to act on,

26:18.626 --> 26:21.210
things I wish you'd do.

26:40.648 --> 26:42.266
I'm really here.

26:44.818 --> 26:46.217
I know you're really here.

26:48.155 --> 26:50.321
Then don't say things like that.

26:52.326 --> 26:54.672
I don't beg you to leave your wife.

26:55.763 --> 26:57.937
I live in reality with you.

26:59.033 --> 27:00.520
I know what this is.

27:02.870 --> 27:04.217
And that's okay.

27:05.039 --> 27:06.201
Okay?

27:07.074 --> 27:08.105
Okay.

27:08.475 --> 27:11.176
[Sighs]

27:14.481 --> 27:15.614
Hey...

27:19.486 --> 27:22.354
Thank you for telling me how you feel.

27:24.258 --> 27:27.659
[Whispers] I like it when you do that.

27:39.173 --> 27:41.440
Crowd: Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

27:41.442 --> 27:42.808
Don't let 'em tell you any different!

27:42.810 --> 27:46.378
Your life matters!
My life matters! Amen!

27:46.380 --> 27:49.414
Amen! Amen! Amen!

27:49.416 --> 27:52.317
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

27:52.319 --> 27:56.305
We are not here asking for revenge. No!

27:56.824 --> 27:59.825
We are here demanding justice...

28:00.060 --> 28:02.661
- Yes!
- Justice for Kenny Collins.

28:02.663 --> 28:05.464
- Justice!
- Justice for Walter Scott.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.432
- Yes!
- Justice for Eric Garner.

28:07.434 --> 28:09.468
- Yes!
- Justice for Tamir Rice

28:09.470 --> 28:11.870
and justice for the thousands of others

28:11.872 --> 28:15.407
unjustly cut down by an army
of the powerful

28:15.409 --> 28:17.576
by the powerful of the powerful

28:17.578 --> 28:21.179
and for the powerful
in a war that ain't over yet.

28:21.181 --> 28:23.382
It is far from over. You know why?

28:23.384 --> 28:26.918
- Why?
- Because black lives matter.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.087
With crowd: Black lives matter!

28:29.089 --> 28:32.858
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

28:32.860 --> 28:35.360
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

28:35.362 --> 28:37.696
Your parents know you're here?

28:37.698 --> 28:40.465
They think we're at the movies.

28:40.467 --> 28:42.501
Come on.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.971
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

28:45.973 --> 28:49.074
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

28:49.076 --> 28:50.409
Black lives matter!

28:52.012 --> 28:53.661
Maybe he lost his nerve.

28:54.048 --> 28:55.693
Wouldn't be the worst thing.

28:56.150 --> 28:57.933
Feel like I'm about to lose mine.

28:58.585 --> 29:01.386
[Branches crack]

29:01.388 --> 29:04.222
Let me handle this, okay? Breezy?

29:04.224 --> 29:06.358
Look. I thought I told you
to come alone.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.894
Hey, don't worry. He's just a friend.

29:08.896 --> 29:10.562
Yeah. Well, where the money at?

29:10.564 --> 29:11.863
I brought $500.

29:11.865 --> 29:13.632
Bitch, I said 5 grand.
You think you slick.

29:13.634 --> 29:14.833
- Hey!
- Listen.

29:14.835 --> 29:16.568
You can walk away right now
and have nothing,

29:16.570 --> 29:18.370
or you can tell me everything
you know about my sister

29:18.372 --> 29:20.036
and have $500. All right?

29:21.308 --> 29:23.412
Look. She'd do anything
to get high, all right?

29:23.811 --> 29:25.101
That's all she cared about.

29:25.679 --> 29:26.725
Videos?

29:27.281 --> 29:29.740
Videos, webcams, whatever.

29:30.451 --> 29:31.782
Are any of them online?

29:32.119 --> 29:33.172
Not yet.

29:34.154 --> 29:35.173
Do what you want.

29:35.856 --> 29:37.517
$500 is all you're gonna get.

29:38.392 --> 29:39.838
Well, can I have it, then?

29:41.495 --> 29:43.061
Did you ever try this with faith?

29:43.063 --> 29:44.496
Try what?

29:44.498 --> 29:47.466
Threaten to show these pictures
or whatever videos to my family

29:47.468 --> 29:48.876
if she didn't pay you?

29:49.336 --> 29:50.769
Oh, that wouldn't make no sense.

29:50.771 --> 29:52.317
Look, she didn't have no money.

30:02.883 --> 30:03.885
Hey.

30:06.286 --> 30:07.753
Do you know why she killed herself?

30:07.755 --> 30:09.517
Look, she didn't even know why.

30:10.090 --> 30:12.013
Have I not made that clear to you?

30:13.794 --> 30:15.394
Look, you look into that girl's eyes,

30:15.396 --> 30:16.895
wasn't nothin' there.

30:16.897 --> 30:17.964
That's not true.

30:20.267 --> 30:21.797
You just couldn't see it.

30:22.936 --> 30:27.406
Yeah. Yeah. Well, same difference.

30:36.350 --> 30:37.949
<i>Now, I wanna bring...</i>

30:37.951 --> 30:41.573
<i>bring up the older brother
of our young Kenny Collins,</i>

30:42.156 --> 30:44.423
<i>Mr. Marlon Collins.</i>

30:44.425 --> 30:45.891
<i>Come on and say a few words, son.</i>

30:45.893 --> 30:48.325
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>

30:49.730 --> 30:52.998
<i>All I want is for the man</i>

30:53.000 --> 30:55.867
<i>who killed my brother to be charged...</i>

30:55.869 --> 30:57.035
<i>Yeah!</i>

30:57.037 --> 30:59.471
<i>Charged like anyone</i>

30:59.473 --> 31:01.229
<i>who pulled that trigger
would be charged.</i>

31:02.142 --> 31:04.242
Woman: <i>That tonight from Triumph Church</i>

31:04.244 --> 31:06.445
<i>where hundreds of protesters
congregated to call for the...</i>

31:06.447 --> 31:07.527
[TV turns off]

31:08.615 --> 31:10.919
You two are lucky nothing
got out of hand at that thing.

31:11.785 --> 31:13.599
You know what a mess
that would've been, right?

31:13.720 --> 31:14.805
We're sorry.

31:15.689 --> 31:17.287
How'd you even get down there?

31:17.825 --> 31:18.879
Uber.

31:21.295 --> 31:25.363
You know, this cousin
of yours is a cautionary tale.

31:25.365 --> 31:27.415
You can't just do everything she says.

31:28.001 --> 31:29.568
It was her idea to go.

31:29.570 --> 31:32.083
I was just encouraging her
to follow her dreams.

31:32.406 --> 31:34.327
If that's my sin, so be it.

31:34.675 --> 31:35.782
Mm-hmm.

31:37.110 --> 31:38.109
How was it?

31:38.111 --> 31:39.134
Sad.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.623
Yeah.

31:41.415 --> 31:43.582
The last thing
he said before he died was,

31:43.584 --> 31:44.668
"I'm sorry."

31:45.385 --> 31:47.185
He was holding the paramedic's
hand, and he just...

31:47.187 --> 31:49.213
He kept saying, "I'm... I'm sorry."

31:50.057 --> 31:52.181
And he hadn't done anything wrong.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.693
Hmm.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.421
Are you gonna tell our moms?

31:57.197 --> 31:58.093
No.

31:59.299 --> 32:02.125
Lord knows I did my share of
disobeying in my time

32:02.336 --> 32:05.884
and for reasons
a lot less righteous than this.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.909
But... Don't do it again.

32:10.577 --> 32:11.525
We won't.

32:13.247 --> 32:14.341
Okay.

32:21.274 --> 32:23.074
Hey, Zora. Let's go, sweetheart.

32:23.076 --> 32:25.322
We're leaving for church
in five minutes.

32:27.014 --> 32:30.382
Looking good, man.
How you doin'? You good?

32:31.952 --> 32:33.090
[Chuckles]

32:33.653 --> 32:35.130
Lookin' sharp, dude.

32:35.822 --> 32:39.891
Just so we're clear, I give.

32:39.893 --> 32:41.128
What do you mean?

32:43.230 --> 32:44.252
Therapy.

32:45.198 --> 32:46.898
We don't have to go.

32:48.568 --> 32:49.772
Why? Like it.

32:50.570 --> 32:52.395
Jacob, you don't even talk.

32:53.073 --> 32:54.672
Well, just because I don't talk

32:54.674 --> 32:56.188
doesn't mean I'm not
gettin' something out of it.

32:57.077 --> 32:58.388
I wanna keep going.

32:58.912 --> 33:02.447
Why? Give me one good reason.

33:06.186 --> 33:09.320
You know, you work with kids all day.

33:09.322 --> 33:10.622
So you think it's always up to you

33:10.624 --> 33:12.257
when things start and stop.

33:19.466 --> 33:23.268
But you gotta check in. I'm really here.

33:26.540 --> 33:29.905
Zora, come on, baby. It's time to go.

33:32.212 --> 33:33.978
What's gonna happen, you think?

33:33.980 --> 33:35.713
People gonna walk out in droves?

33:35.715 --> 33:37.082
I have no idea.

33:37.084 --> 33:39.851
They take their church very seriously.

33:39.853 --> 33:42.487
Then again, they take
their church seriously.

33:42.489 --> 33:44.556
There you are. Mayor's looking for you.

33:44.558 --> 33:48.693
- Noah, this is David Nelson.
- Heard of him. Noah Kendall.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.628
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.600
- See you after?
- Yeah.

33:56.336 --> 33:58.112
That's your research assistant?

33:59.573 --> 34:00.839
Yeah. Noah...

34:00.841 --> 34:02.513
It's none of my business.

34:03.143 --> 34:06.912
We hear a lot of talk today
about black lives matter.

34:07.614 --> 34:09.347
But it seems like most of the time,

34:09.349 --> 34:10.648
what folks are sayin' when they say,

34:10.650 --> 34:13.717
"black lives matter,"
is that black deaths matter.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.188
- Congregation: Yeah.
- And they do.

34:17.424 --> 34:18.889
Now, from what I've gleaned

34:18.891 --> 34:21.243
from my readin' just this mornin',

34:21.928 --> 34:25.036
the coroner's report indicates
that poor Kenny Collins

34:25.431 --> 34:27.556
passed away en route to the hospital.

34:28.201 --> 34:31.235
Now, that means that officer Nelson,

34:31.237 --> 34:32.837
who's here with us today along

34:32.839 --> 34:34.572
with dozens of his fellow officers,

34:34.708 --> 34:36.940
- Officer Nelson...
- [Congregation murmuring]

34:36.943 --> 34:39.010
who had an unblemished record

34:39.012 --> 34:40.545
until the night in question

34:40.547 --> 34:42.368
and must have,

34:43.150 --> 34:44.657
upon discovering

34:44.951 --> 34:47.831
Mr. Collins was in fact unarmed

34:48.355 --> 34:52.456
felt that he'd made a terrible mistake.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.125
[Congregation murmuring]

34:54.127 --> 34:56.460
He spent more than a few minutes
with Mr. Collins

34:56.463 --> 34:59.400
as they waited together
for that ambulance,

35:00.800 --> 35:03.127
- 12 1/2 to be exact.
- [Murmuring, affirming]

35:04.738 --> 35:06.404
And to put a fine point on it,

35:06.406 --> 35:08.208
for those 12 1/2 minutes,

35:08.475 --> 35:11.676
officer Nelson's eyes were the only eyes

35:11.678 --> 35:14.479
god was lookin'
through at that innocent boy

35:14.481 --> 35:16.948
- as he suffered.
- [Scattered applause]

35:16.950 --> 35:18.869
And I have to believe

35:20.687 --> 35:22.020
that those eyes were filled

35:22.022 --> 35:25.323
with infinite mercy...

35:25.325 --> 35:27.559
- [Murmuring continues]
- And infinite regret. Amen.

35:27.561 --> 35:30.228
Congregation: Amen.

35:30.230 --> 35:31.918
Are you listenin' to me?
Can you hear me?

35:32.432 --> 35:36.634
[Scattered applause]

35:36.636 --> 35:40.572
The crisis we're facin' today
as I see it goes so much deeper

35:40.574 --> 35:44.442
than one of cops versus civilians...

35:44.444 --> 35:45.957
- Yes.
- ...So much deeper.

35:46.446 --> 35:51.616
The crisis today is the moments of life.

35:51.618 --> 35:53.651
All black folks who are livin' today...

35:53.653 --> 35:56.454
Are still not understood by some people

35:56.456 --> 35:58.990
to be of the same substance and value

35:58.992 --> 36:00.534
as those of other people,

36:00.760 --> 36:03.534
mowin' their grass
on a Saturday afternoon,

36:04.598 --> 36:06.130
watching the Sun set over the ocean

36:06.132 --> 36:09.666
for the first time, singin' in your car,

36:10.070 --> 36:12.570
settin' at the table
with your granddaughters...

36:12.572 --> 36:14.672
[Congregation affirming]

36:14.674 --> 36:16.474
Just being a human being!

36:16.476 --> 36:17.842
- Yes!
- Yes.

36:17.844 --> 36:19.477
These... these black deaths

36:19.479 --> 36:20.845
that we hear about every day now...

36:20.847 --> 36:22.780
Go on, now.

36:22.782 --> 36:25.783
Are tolerated
because the black experience

36:25.785 --> 36:27.352
in the minds of many

36:27.354 --> 36:29.978
is still a thing of meager value.

36:30.257 --> 36:31.856
[Cheering]

36:31.858 --> 36:35.202
And finally, and I'm here
to remind our guests,

36:35.962 --> 36:39.230
the brave men and women
who police our streets...

36:39.232 --> 36:40.732
[Cheering]

36:40.734 --> 36:43.935
...and god bless them all
sincerely for doin' a job

36:43.937 --> 36:46.330
I know I'm not brave enough
to do myself.

36:47.874 --> 36:51.282
Those people you're shootin'
out there aren't shadows.

36:52.779 --> 36:54.178
They're people.

36:54.180 --> 36:55.546
They're real.

36:55.548 --> 36:57.615
They're not characters
in some video game.

36:57.617 --> 37:00.084
[Shouting indistinctly]

37:00.086 --> 37:01.858
Black lives matter.

37:02.889 --> 37:04.856
Black lives matter!

37:04.858 --> 37:06.357
Black lives matter.

37:06.359 --> 37:08.726
Black tears matter.

37:08.728 --> 37:11.229
Black feelings, black hopes,

37:11.231 --> 37:12.666
black regrets,

37:23.376 --> 37:27.178

37:27.180 --> 37:29.847
knows this with certainty...

Feels the full value of black life,

37:33.186 --> 37:36.721

heavy in your hand...

38:58.338 --> 38:59.670
Hi. You got a second?

38:59.672 --> 39:01.973
Indeed I do. What a message today.

39:01.975 --> 39:03.541
Mm, and what a response.

39:03.543 --> 39:05.209
Oh, the gospel...
no pleasing the people.

39:05.211 --> 39:06.444
The bishop bidding on that.

39:06.446 --> 39:08.363
You know, look at all of these.

39:08.715 --> 39:10.381
- Prayer requests?
- You bet.

39:10.383 --> 39:12.083
Most of them are for the bishop's soul,

39:12.085 --> 39:13.718
but no matter.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.453
We're gonna lift him up
to the lord, and just...

39:15.455 --> 39:16.888
Well, here we are.

39:16.890 --> 39:19.157
- Where?
- Your office.

39:23.863 --> 39:25.129
Where'd the hymnals get to?

39:25.131 --> 39:26.697
That's not your problem, pastor.

39:26.699 --> 39:28.299
[Chuckles]

39:31.604 --> 39:35.089
You don't know what this means,
that you would do this for me.

39:36.176 --> 39:38.743
Let's assume that's true. After you.

39:48.922 --> 39:50.621
I'm gonna get a lot done in here.

39:50.623 --> 39:51.950
I'm sure of it.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.325
So I'll see you Monday?

39:54.327 --> 39:56.060
Well, you know where to find me.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.421
Open or closed, pastor?

40:01.334 --> 40:02.221
Closed.

40:12.712 --> 40:15.079
Well, all I can say is, "bravo."

40:15.081 --> 40:17.081
I know some folks walked out,

40:17.083 --> 40:19.083
but all the major papers were there.

40:19.085 --> 40:20.485
Skanks and banks can...

40:20.487 --> 40:22.720
Take that show on the road. [Laughs]

40:22.722 --> 40:24.088
Well, they'll be off the front page

40:24.090 --> 40:26.090
as of tomorrow, I predict.

40:26.092 --> 40:27.563
And you know who's gonna be there?

40:27.927 --> 40:28.772
You.

40:29.529 --> 40:32.563
The truth is, we all doubled up
on our blood pressure meds.

40:32.565 --> 40:35.600
But the news cycle
puts its own dogs down.

40:35.602 --> 40:37.036
Until the next time.

40:37.670 --> 40:38.668
Excuse me?

40:39.172 --> 40:40.659
This can't happen again.

40:41.374 --> 40:43.441
You've gotta get those boys in hand.

40:43.443 --> 40:45.139
We did you a favor here.

40:45.745 --> 40:47.178
Don't make us regret it.

40:47.180 --> 40:48.880
We did each other a favor, James.

40:48.882 --> 40:50.196
I don't want your land.

40:52.252 --> 40:53.707
Just do a better job.

40:54.254 --> 40:56.988
Kill fewer of our children,
and we'll be fine.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.876
You know what? You're right.

41:02.495 --> 41:03.828
We should all do our best

41:03.830 --> 41:06.230
