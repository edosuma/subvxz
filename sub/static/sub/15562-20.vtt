00:02.664 --> 00:04.143
What am I supposed to wear
to your wedding?

00:04.158 --> 00:05.899
The invitation just says, "Not basic."

00:06.065 --> 00:07.465
You know, not basic.

00:07.533 --> 00:09.634
I don't know how to explain it
more than that.

00:09.702 --> 00:11.969
Yeah, like, Adam's wearing a gray suit.

00:12.037 --> 00:13.938
Mm, I mean, that's, like, semi-basic,

00:14.039 --> 00:15.873
but you guys are old.

00:15.941 --> 00:17.239
No one's looking at you anyways.

00:17.239 --> 00:19.277
I didn't know you were bringing Adam.

00:19.345 --> 00:21.412
Yeah, I thought your marriage was, like,

00:25.818 --> 00:27.429
No, it's fine.

00:27.505 --> 00:30.093
We're in couples
counseling and it's fine,

00:30.165 --> 00:32.064
and, please, nobody
be weird around him.,

00:32.064 --> 00:32.957
- Okay?
- No...

00:33.025 --> 00:34.759
I'm, like, super cazh.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.039
And, please, nobody say "super cazh,"

00:37.087 --> 00:38.043
like, as a life rule.

00:38.044 --> 00:40.112
Well, personally,
I'm gonna wear a polo dress.

00:40.113 --> 00:42.729
All right? It's simple,
beautiful, elegant...

00:43.428 --> 00:44.793
Oh, but then again, I do have one

00:44.861 --> 00:46.295
of Nancy Pelosi's old pantsuits.

00:46.363 --> 00:47.463
I won it at an auction.

00:47.530 --> 00:48.464
Do you think that would be better?

00:48.562 --> 00:50.699
I'm actually just wearing
my bridesmaid's dress.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.067
You asked Amy to be a bridesmaid,

00:52.135 --> 00:53.335
but you didn't ask me?

00:53.403 --> 00:55.037
What? Ohhh!

00:55.105 --> 00:57.439
Uhhh...

00:57.507 --> 00:58.674
- Yah!
- I get it.

00:58.742 --> 00:59.908
Ah!

01:00.524 --> 01:02.344
I just kind of always wanted
to be a bridesmaid, and I...

01:03.038 --> 01:04.287
I don't know if I'll ever get
another chance.

01:04.288 --> 01:05.973
I mean...

01:06.041 --> 01:07.608
my sister's just so ugly.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.910
All right, Dina...

01:09.978 --> 01:12.079
you can be a bridesmaid.

01:12.146 --> 01:13.192
Yes! Oh!

01:13.193 --> 01:14.466
You will not regret this.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.084
Okay, I'm gonna need to see
my dress asap,

01:17.152 --> 01:18.831
in case I want to change
the cut or the color.

01:20.086 --> 01:23.315
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:29.273 --> 01:31.042
Does this sound fancy to you?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.336
Nah, just sounds like gold
clinking up against crystal.

01:35.404 --> 01:36.271
What?

01:36.738 --> 01:39.340
Those are two of the
most expensive things!

01:39.408 --> 01:41.208
Relax, dude, it's not a competition.

01:41.209 --> 01:43.477
I just got something from the
"lost and found" bin at work.

01:43.545 --> 01:45.312
I don't want people spending money

01:45.380 --> 01:47.080
they might not have tomorrow.

01:49.051 --> 01:51.453
Corporate is making me
lay off six people.

01:51.532 --> 01:52.501
Whoa. There's gonna be layoffs?

01:52.503 --> 01:53.054
Shh!

01:53.571 --> 01:54.884
I don't want anyone to know.

01:54.885 --> 01:57.124
Okay, well, they're gonna find out
when the paychecks stop coming.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.272
- I'll tell them tomorrow.
- Mm.

01:59.281 --> 02:01.429
Cheyenne's wedding
should be a day of joy...

02:01.913 --> 02:03.346
that people look back on and say,

02:03.414 --> 02:04.847
"I was happy that day.

02:05.316 --> 02:07.784
That was the last day I was happy."

02:07.852 --> 02:09.553
- You look fine.
- Yeah? Fine?

02:09.654 --> 02:10.854
Yeah, fine. Yeah, good, like...

02:10.922 --> 02:12.089
like you always do.

02:12.156 --> 02:13.090
- Nice, you look nice.
- Thanks.

02:13.191 --> 02:14.324
You too.

02:14.392 --> 02:15.725
I feel like everyone is looking at us.

02:15.832 --> 02:17.067
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

02:17.068 --> 02:18.228
Adam, nobody's looking at us.

02:18.296 --> 02:19.262
Adam!

02:19.330 --> 02:20.263
Sorry. Adam.

02:20.331 --> 02:21.598
Hey!

02:21.666 --> 02:23.153
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

02:23.154 --> 02:25.033
You know what? Come on,
let's bring it in here.

02:25.033 --> 02:26.070
- Hey.
- Yeah!

02:26.137 --> 02:27.337
It's good to see you.

02:27.405 --> 02:29.207
What's up? What's new with you?

02:29.262 --> 02:31.430
I mean, with work, not...
not personal stuff.

02:31.739 --> 02:33.110
- Super cazh.
- No doubt.

02:33.177 --> 02:35.045
Still unemployed, but...

02:35.113 --> 02:36.480
Cool.

02:38.916 --> 02:40.400
- I'm Kristen, by the way.
- Yes!

02:40.606 --> 02:41.951
- That's Kristen.
- Hi.

02:42.197 --> 02:43.397
- My husband.
- My... my husband.

02:43.465 --> 02:45.299
- Sorry, that's... Yeah.
- It's my husband.

02:48.303 --> 02:49.403
Oh.

02:49.471 --> 02:51.638
- I...
- What are you doing here?

02:52.267 --> 02:53.745
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:53.793 --> 02:55.509
Jear Bear, can you go get my vape pen?

02:55.577 --> 02:57.208
I left it in the car.

02:57.430 --> 02:59.178
Oh, you're here together.

02:59.258 --> 03:00.925
Yeah! You remember Jerry.

03:00.993 --> 03:02.727
We all met at that restaurant.

03:02.795 --> 03:04.362
It's nice to see you again.

03:04.463 --> 03:06.131
It's nice to see you again...

03:06.198 --> 03:06.954
also.

03:08.768 --> 03:10.335
Kind of need that vape pen now.

03:10.402 --> 03:11.793
Right. Sorry.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.795
I love how strawberry
smoke smells in my hair.

03:16.509 --> 03:17.509
I bet.

03:22.146 --> 03:22.714
Chins up.

03:23.095 --> 03:24.616
Beautiful, ladies, perfect.

03:25.090 --> 03:25.990
Ma'am, could you lean back?

03:26.058 --> 03:27.325
There's a shadow on the bride.

03:27.393 --> 03:28.445
Oh, sure.

03:29.028 --> 03:30.562
How are you feeling? Are you nervous?

03:30.629 --> 03:32.205
No, just excited.

03:32.491 --> 03:34.052
Listen, I filled my purse
with muscle relaxants

03:34.124 --> 03:35.433
and anti-flatulent meds.

03:35.501 --> 03:37.202
Oh, and if you're gonna puke,
you can use the purse.

03:37.269 --> 03:38.113
Okay, thanks.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.837
Told you I'd be a good bridesmaid.

03:39.905 --> 03:41.539
It's okay to be nervous,
if you are, you know?

03:41.607 --> 03:43.341
I was totally nervous at my wedding.

03:43.409 --> 03:45.677
I was like, "Aah! Should I run away?"

03:45.744 --> 03:47.212
Wouldn't that be so funny

03:47.279 --> 03:48.479
if you just, like, ran away

03:48.547 --> 03:50.803
and went to college or something?

03:51.033 --> 03:52.150
I was just kidding.

03:52.218 --> 03:54.294
What if we did our squad pose?

03:54.366 --> 03:57.067
Yeah! Squad pose!

03:57.089 --> 03:57.988
Oh, yeah.

03:57.990 --> 03:59.124
Oh, okay...

03:59.337 --> 04:00.504
- Dina, just...
- I'm sorry.

04:00.572 --> 04:01.639
- Maybe lean...
- What?

04:01.706 --> 04:02.673
- Just lean.
- I'm leaning.

04:02.741 --> 04:03.574
- Lean in.
- I'm leaning!

04:03.675 --> 04:04.642
Shadow.

04:04.709 --> 04:05.676
I can't control the sun!

04:05.832 --> 04:07.878
Yo, fellas, like,
"sinceriously," thank you

04:07.946 --> 04:09.847
for attending my nuptials
and what-have-you-not.

04:09.915 --> 04:11.124
- Sure.
- Yeah.

04:11.155 --> 04:12.717
You know what? Like, life is crazy.

04:12.851 --> 04:13.984
I never thought I'd have
so many nerds at my wedding.

04:14.052 --> 04:14.985
You know what I'm saying? Ha.

04:15.053 --> 04:16.887
Ooh! Drama.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.589
Amy's real husband.

04:18.656 --> 04:20.024
Amy's work husband.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.791
- Work husband?
- Huh.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.861
- Should I be worried?
- No!

04:23.929 --> 04:25.807
No, I mean... No, I got you.

04:25.839 --> 04:27.159
Yeah, you look out!

04:27.160 --> 04:29.055
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

04:29.057 --> 04:30.957
Yeah, yeah, you are Amy's work husband.

04:30.958 --> 04:32.790
I see you two together,
like, all the time,

04:32.791 --> 04:35.127
walking around, you know...

04:35.228 --> 04:36.995
It's like he's got wedding brain.

04:37.063 --> 04:38.930
Sure. Okay.

04:38.998 --> 04:41.066
Whoa! Easy on the shrimp!

04:41.134 --> 04:42.901
Those are supposed to be for everybody.

04:42.969 --> 04:44.002
I only took a few.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.504
Yeah, took a few hundred.

04:45.605 --> 04:47.139
- All right, put that back.
- Okay.

04:47.206 --> 04:49.408
Yo, keep this girl away from the ocean!

04:49.509 --> 04:51.376
That's where all the shrimp's at.

04:51.444 --> 04:54.579
These people aren't cogs
you can just throw away.

04:54.647 --> 04:55.881
They're a family.

04:55.982 --> 04:58.717
They talk. They stand around.

04:58.818 --> 05:00.952
I guess that's all
they're doing right now.

05:01.623 --> 05:03.488
I wish Jeff could see this.

05:03.556 --> 05:05.791
Maybe I should invite Jeff here.

05:05.858 --> 05:06.825
Yes.

05:06.893 --> 05:09.194
You should definitely do that.

What is he wearing?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.616
He looks like a woman.

05:26.703 --> 05:27.493
Bo?

05:27.900 --> 05:28.934
Bo is a woman.

05:29.143 --> 05:30.010
Oh?

05:30.255 --> 05:31.381
Lesbians.

05:31.383 --> 05:32.817
Big-time.

05:33.091 --> 05:35.993
The whole world's going gay.

05:37.729 --> 05:38.662
Bigger steps.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.097
You guys are killing our pace.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.433
And one of you is wearing
too much Cool Water.

05:42.501 --> 05:43.601
Yeah, that's me, Dina.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.503
Aw, Amy looks beautiful.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.704
Not my type.

05:46.772 --> 05:47.838
Mm-mm. No, I only like

05:47.906 --> 05:50.741
tall, blue-eyed blondes...

05:50.809 --> 05:54.311
and shorter Asians, but that is it.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.714
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today

06:13.754 --> 06:16.167
to witness the union
of Cheyenne Taylor Lee

06:16.439 --> 06:19.060
and Bilbo Derek Thompson
in holy matrimony,

06:19.062 --> 06:20.571
to be joined as husband and wife

06:21.281 --> 06:22.247
for all eternity.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.302
No, I can't do this, okay? No.

06:23.304 --> 06:24.404
Bo, stop it.

06:25.056 --> 06:27.186
No, okay? I got to be free.
You can't chain me down!

06:29.023 --> 06:31.023
Do you have to do this right now?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.958
Cheyenne, maybe it's for the best.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.827
No, what's up? This can't wait, okay?

06:34.894 --> 06:36.595
Okay, I can't stand up in here
and say all these words

06:36.663 --> 06:38.173
about loving you forever.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.834
But I can rap them.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.036
Then we're gonna need a sick-ass beat.

07:02.057 --> 07:04.392
Ain't no way I'm getting
hitched to my ride-or-die

07:04.460 --> 07:06.194
without my boys here repping me, son.

07:06.261 --> 07:08.062
What's up?

07:08.130 --> 07:09.197
Yeah!

07:09.264 --> 07:11.365
Auntie Beth! Oh, my!

07:11.433 --> 07:13.081
So good to see you.

07:13.082 --> 07:14.602
Are you getting younger or prettier?

07:14.670 --> 07:16.104
I can't tell.

07:20.075 --> 07:21.809
- Ow!
- Relax, Bridezilla.

07:21.877 --> 07:23.277
So, as your bridesmaid,

07:23.345 --> 07:26.047
I'm supposed to come
hold your dress while you...

07:26.115 --> 07:27.815
you know, piss and [bleep].

07:27.916 --> 07:29.550
And I'm clocking you in at three hours

07:29.651 --> 07:30.685
since your last pit stop.

07:30.687 --> 07:32.621
Um, I-I'm good, thank you.

07:32.788 --> 07:33.693
Yeah.

07:33.730 --> 07:35.798
For me, now is kind of perfect,

07:36.058 --> 07:38.760
because those mini pizzas
you served earlier are just...

07:38.827 --> 07:39.560
not sitting.

07:40.262 --> 07:41.702
Okay, fine, I'll go.

07:41.734 --> 07:42.563
Let's do this.

07:42.697 --> 07:44.531
Oh! Table three.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.036
Party table. Whoo!

07:46.211 --> 07:48.360
- Whoo!
- Ooh-ah.

07:48.472 --> 07:50.240
No, that... that's not
what we were doing.

07:50.307 --> 07:51.443
Yeah, I know.

07:52.209 --> 07:54.110
Um...

07:54.178 --> 07:55.778
Oh, okay.

07:55.846 --> 07:58.147
Uh, you know what? Maybe we
should sit somewhere else.

07:58.215 --> 07:59.816
Pretty sure you're supposed
to sit at the table

07:59.883 --> 08:00.827
they tell you to.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.428
Okay, square.

08:02.495 --> 08:04.697
I don't know how
you stayed married to her.

08:04.764 --> 08:06.632
I didn't mean... That wasn't...

08:06.733 --> 08:07.766
Um, cool!

08:07.834 --> 08:09.268
Cool, cool.

08:09.336 --> 08:10.469
All right.

08:10.537 --> 08:12.301
How're we doing over here, huh?

08:12.388 --> 08:13.238
What are you doing?

08:13.306 --> 08:14.707
I just like to sit...

08:14.774 --> 08:17.276
facing Elias.

08:17.344 --> 08:19.244
Hey.

08:19.312 --> 08:21.818
Table nine, the buffet is now open.

08:22.406 --> 08:23.262
Go wild.

08:23.358 --> 08:24.658
You're making announcements?

08:24.659 --> 08:26.109
Doesn't it feel like
you're just at work?

08:26.194 --> 08:28.720
Well, what can I say, man?
I just love the power.

08:28.721 --> 08:30.213
Table eight.

08:30.281 --> 08:31.739
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

08:32.667 --> 08:33.929
Now you can go.

08:35.186 --> 08:36.453
- Hey.
- There you are!

08:36.520 --> 08:37.453
What's the emergency?

08:37.520 --> 08:39.355
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:39.423 --> 08:41.224
You remember Cheyenne, don't you?

08:41.292 --> 08:43.025
She just got married.

08:43.094 --> 08:45.395
Hi. Yes, this is your wedding.

08:45.463 --> 08:47.063
So why would you...
I'm sorry that I'm...

08:47.131 --> 08:47.997
I'm wearing shorts.

08:48.065 --> 08:49.516
I was at a Frisbee golf thing.

08:49.517 --> 08:50.967
- Cool.
- It's cool. It's cool.

08:51.035 --> 08:52.769
Hey, fun fact about Cheyenne

08:52.870 --> 08:55.004
is she's severely uneducated,

08:55.072 --> 08:58.641
so her job's the only thing standing
between her and prostitution.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.944
Now, let me introduce you
to some other peeps

09:01.011 --> 09:02.679
who are right on the poverty line.

09:02.747 --> 09:03.813
I'm sorry about the...

09:03.914 --> 09:05.533
- I never prostituted.
- No.

09:07.618 --> 09:08.852
- What you have been...
- So how have...

09:08.919 --> 09:10.854
Sorry.

09:10.921 --> 09:12.021
You go.

09:12.089 --> 09:13.656
How's your boyfriend?

09:13.724 --> 09:14.758
We're not dating anymore.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.860
Oh. Um...

09:16.927 --> 09:18.094
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:18.162 --> 09:19.086
Yeah.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.343
I made him up.

09:25.443 --> 09:26.378
- Okay.
- Thank you.

09:26.379 --> 09:28.244
Bye. Yeah. Here you go.

09:28.245 --> 09:30.650
I need a super-embarrassing
story about you.

09:30.651 --> 09:32.350
- Why?
- It's just for my speech.

09:32.357 --> 09:33.216
And it's not essential,

09:33.217 --> 09:36.308
but if it could rhyme with
"fellatio," that would be icing.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.769
No, Dina, most of the bridesmaids
aren't giving toasts.

09:38.770 --> 09:39.852
- I'm not.
- Well...

09:40.272 --> 09:42.310
I mean, no offense,
but you're not funny.

09:42.311 --> 09:43.376
I'm funny.

09:43.377 --> 09:44.882
Sure, you're hilarious.

09:44.883 --> 09:45.630
Come on.

09:45.631 --> 09:47.251
Oh, my God. You look so gorgeous.

09:47.252 --> 09:48.467
The ceremony was beautiful.

09:48.468 --> 09:49.853
Why the hell did you invite Jeff?

09:49.854 --> 09:52.326
I didn't. I think he came with Glenn.

09:52.327 --> 09:54.053
No, a-as a friend.

09:54.054 --> 09:56.402
I'm not ready to talk to Jeff right now.

09:56.403 --> 09:58.745
Mateo, you think I'm funny, right?

09:59.717 --> 10:00.919
Uh-huh.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.443
Attention, wedding guests,
specifically Bo's friends.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.063
Just because I'm a DJ

10:06.064 --> 10:08.272
does not mean I am "carrying" Molly.

10:08.655 --> 10:10.211
So please stop asking.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.452
Thank you for shopping at Cloud 9.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.758
Damn it. Sorry. Force of habit.

10:14.759 --> 10:16.645
Justine lives in a studio apartment,

10:17.018 --> 10:20.804
and she's 40, so obviously
a lot of need there.

10:22.141 --> 10:23.406
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

10:23.473 --> 10:24.613
Uh, Glenn.

10:24.614 --> 10:25.991
- What?
- I'm... I'm gonna leave now.

10:26.022 --> 10:28.057
- Why?
- Because this is a wedding

10:28.058 --> 10:29.281
that I was not invited to.

10:29.282 --> 10:30.451
Plus, I'm wearing shorts.

10:30.452 --> 10:32.155
I didn't make you wear shorts.

10:32.156 --> 10:33.918
Still, I'm just gonna...

10:33.919 --> 10:34.914
- I got to go.
- No, no, no.

10:34.937 --> 10:36.555
You can't leave without saying hi

10:36.556 --> 10:39.055
to Cheyenne's adorable daughter,

10:39.056 --> 10:40.092
Harmonica.

10:40.093 --> 10:42.069
And don't let those
chubby cheeks fool you.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.492
If her parents can't
keep buying food for her...

10:45.008 --> 10:45.906
she'll die.

10:46.319 --> 10:48.932
I'm gonna show you to somebody, yeah.

10:51.035 --> 10:52.369
Wait.

10:52.436 --> 10:54.556
What am I supposed to do with this?

11:01.117 --> 11:02.717
Okay...

11:02.785 --> 11:04.252
Mama.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.054
What is his game?

11:06.122 --> 11:07.989
He just shows up out of nowhere,

11:08.057 --> 11:10.683
flashing those legs,
carrying a baby around.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.274
I get it... you're father material.

11:14.057 --> 11:16.420
I mean, I hate kids, but I love dads.

11:18.148 --> 11:20.773
So do you always play the man?

11:20.774 --> 11:22.446
Uh... yeah.

11:22.514 --> 11:23.981
Yeah, most of the time.

11:24.048 --> 11:27.418
Oh, that's... that's wonderful.

11:27.485 --> 11:28.252
Yeah.

11:28.576 --> 11:30.988
Oh, I see you went
with the Pink Cheyenne.

11:31.089 --> 11:34.925
Yeah, it's Code Red,
vodka, and 13 cherries.

11:34.993 --> 11:36.360
I'm kind of into it.

11:36.428 --> 11:38.130
Oh, look. There you guys are.

11:38.983 --> 11:40.297
Oh, that's cute.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.498
Yeah, yeah.

11:41.566 --> 11:43.267
But that is atypical, you know?

11:43.334 --> 11:45.135
If you caught us on a normal day,

11:45.203 --> 11:47.137
she'd probably have her hands
around my neck, you know...

11:47.205 --> 11:48.739
"Jonah, you screwed up again.

11:48.807 --> 11:50.140
Go clean Softlines."

11:50.208 --> 11:51.208
Okay, I don't talk like that.

11:51.276 --> 11:52.943
Well, sometimes.

11:53.011 --> 11:54.845
"Adam, wash your tennis shoes.

11:54.913 --> 11:56.146
"They're disgusting."

11:56.214 --> 11:57.881
Okay, well, they are disgusting

11:57.949 --> 11:59.450
'cause there was a family
of spiders living in them, so...

11:59.517 --> 12:02.085
Okay, well, they're my
shoes, and I paid for them,

12:02.153 --> 12:03.720
so it's kind of none of your business.

12:03.788 --> 12:05.255
Yeah, well, I was just
asking you to be an adult

12:05.323 --> 12:06.890
every now and then, so...
I know, but still.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.158
Yeah, okay.

12:10.228 --> 12:11.624
I'm Team Adam.

12:13.097 --> 12:15.032
All right, ladies and gents.

12:15.099 --> 12:17.334
I'm gonna get this thing
humming with a few jokes.

12:17.402 --> 12:18.969
Dina, you really don't have to.

12:19.037 --> 12:20.337
No, it's okay. It's okay.

12:20.405 --> 12:22.426
I'm a bridesmaid. It's part of my job.

12:22.696 --> 12:24.308
All right, joke one...

12:24.375 --> 12:26.844
marriage is a three-ring circus,

12:26.945 --> 12:28.779
engagement ring,

12:28.847 --> 12:30.280
wedding ring,

12:30.348 --> 12:32.149
suffering.

12:34.519 --> 12:35.719
So...

12:35.787 --> 12:37.090
that was joke one.

12:43.061 --> 12:44.828
That's a grammar joke.

12:45.351 --> 12:46.580
If English isn't your first language,

12:46.581 --> 12:48.196
that one may be lost on you.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.356
Okay, next up...

12:51.424 --> 12:54.159
what do you call a woman
who likes small penises?

12:54.226 --> 12:55.961
- Hopefully Cheyenne.
- Okay.

12:56.028 --> 12:57.128
I'm kidding.
The little ones tend to be...

12:57.196 --> 12:58.744
All right, thank you, Dina,

12:58.745 --> 13:01.433
for those beautiful
and appropriate words.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
Yeah, well, good luck,

13:02.568 --> 13:04.061
'cause this crowd blows!

13:06.731 --> 13:07.864
Uh, hi.

13:07.866 --> 13:09.200
I just wanted to say

13:09.508 --> 13:12.621
congratulations to Cheyenne and Bo.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.947
Um...

13:16.015 --> 13:18.283
uh, I... I love you, Cheyenne.

13:18.850 --> 13:21.119
You remind me of me.

13:21.187 --> 13:23.788
I-I also met my husband in high school,

13:23.856 --> 13:25.757
and we did the whole "baby first" thing,

13:25.825 --> 13:27.859
and then got married because we had to.

13:27.927 --> 13:29.160
I mean, not... Wah!

13:29.228 --> 13:30.996
I didn't mean we had to. I meant...

13:31.063 --> 13:33.865
I meant we got pregnant
so we got married...

13:33.933 --> 13:35.834
but, um, marriage is amazing!

13:35.901 --> 13:37.736
I mean, is it hard work?

13:37.803 --> 13:39.406
Yes. Duh.

13:39.407 --> 13:41.101
Like, that's the cliché, right?

13:41.109 --> 13:43.041
"Ah, it's so hard," because it is.

13:43.109 --> 13:44.876
You know, one second everything's great,

13:44.944 --> 13:48.084
and then you step on some invisible
land mine, and you're fighting.

13:48.085 --> 13:49.698
Boom! Ka-boom!

13:50.243 --> 13:51.406
Uh...

13:52.423 --> 13:54.524
'Cause it's hard. It's just...
It's hard.

13:54.592 --> 13:55.518
But...

13:55.519 --> 13:57.527
it is the hard

13:57.595 --> 13:59.360
that makes it good.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.131
That... that wasn't me.

14:02.181 --> 14:03.607
That was from "A League of Their Own."

14:03.608 --> 14:06.273
Why did Madonna and Rosie
O'Donnell stop being friends?

14:06.275 --> 14:07.840
I feel like something
happened there, right?

14:07.841 --> 14:09.584
Maybe we should talk about that.

14:11.408 --> 14:13.576
The desert table is now open

14:13.644 --> 14:16.674
for anybody who would
like to stop talking.

14:17.214 --> 14:19.646
But, okay, what I'm trying to say

14:19.647 --> 14:22.519
is that no matter how tough it gets,

14:22.586 --> 14:24.187
it's gonna be fine.

14:24.255 --> 14:26.022
It's gonna be...

14:26.090 --> 14:27.991
so...

14:28.058 --> 14:29.025
fine.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.433
You know?

14:30.794 --> 14:31.528
Just give me the... Give it...

14:31.595 --> 14:32.829
- But I...
- Give it to me.

14:34.098 --> 14:35.431
You heard it here first, folks.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.100
Marriage is fine.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.835
Yikes.

14:40.665 --> 14:42.766
Oh! Oh, you like the joke
about Amy's marriage?

14:42.825 --> 14:43.907
'Cause I got a ton of those.

14:43.974 --> 14:46.281
Amy's marriage is so bad...

14:46.428 --> 14:48.535
How bad is it?

14:56.243 --> 14:58.345
Wow. You're a really good dancer.

14:58.519 --> 15:00.043
Thanks. You too.

15:05.968 --> 15:07.757
Hey, do you think Amy's okay?

15:07.932 --> 15:10.047
Aw. You worried about your work wife?

15:10.048 --> 15:11.951
Me? No. No, I don't even care about her.

15:11.959 --> 15:12.747
No.

15:12.748 --> 15:14.522
Hey. We should move in together.

15:14.523 --> 15:15.516
What?

15:15.517 --> 15:17.628
Dude, what is with you tonight?

15:20.426 --> 15:22.900
I'm tired. I think I want to head out.

15:23.001 --> 15:23.796
Okay, yeah.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.649
I'll just say good-bye
to everybody, and we can go.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.252
No, you should stay.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.201
I'll grab a cab.

15:28.202 --> 15:29.466
Adam.

15:30.643 --> 15:32.910
Look, I'm sorry about the toast, okay?

15:32.911 --> 15:35.007
I-I-I didn't know what to say.

15:35.008 --> 15:36.455
I just... I started rambling,

15:36.456 --> 15:37.834
and then I couldn't stop rambling.

15:37.835 --> 15:38.330
I wasn't even...

15:38.331 --> 15:41.423
Would you have married me
if we hadn't gotten pregnant?

15:44.414 --> 15:45.791
Would you have asked?

15:50.597 --> 15:52.696
Well, then what are we doing?

15:54.238 --> 15:56.653
- Thank you.
- Dina, this is for you.

15:56.931 --> 15:58.007
What's this?

15:58.008 --> 16:00.932
It's my bridesmaid gift,
just to say thank you.

16:01.858 --> 16:02.741
Oh.

16:04.012 --> 16:05.349
You're welcome.

16:07.078 --> 16:09.022
You know what?
Actually, I don't feel comfortable

16:09.023 --> 16:10.672
taking cheap jewelry into my house.

16:10.673 --> 16:11.860
One of the birds is gonna get into it,

16:11.868 --> 16:14.001
then it's another midnight
run to the urgent care.

16:14.002 --> 16:17.205
So I think you should return it
and just give me the cash.

16:19.129 --> 16:20.316
Thanks, girl.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.383
Sometimes the headline will say,

16:23.384 --> 16:25.513
"What happens next is unbelievable,"

16:25.514 --> 16:28.291
but then it's, like,
kind of underwhelming.

16:28.292 --> 16:28.912
I know.

16:28.913 --> 16:31.782
It's almost like they're trying
to trick me into clicking.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.536
I'm tired. Let's go.

16:33.537 --> 16:35.231
Already? They haven't even cut the cake.

16:35.239 --> 16:36.794
I've seen people cut cake before.

16:36.795 --> 16:37.646
Let's go.

16:40.337 --> 16:42.104
I really enjoyed talking to you.

16:42.227 --> 16:43.731
I really enjoyed talking to you, too.

16:43.732 --> 16:45.746
I can't start the car with my mind!

16:46.557 --> 16:47.490
Bye.

16:47.557 --> 16:49.158
Bye.

16:54.564 --> 16:56.498
- Jeff!
- Shh.

16:56.566 --> 16:57.699
This baby's asleep.

16:58.086 --> 17:00.106
Have you been
at the wedding this entire time?

17:00.160 --> 17:00.694
Yes.

17:00.695 --> 17:03.492
You saw me when I came in, and
then I think we made eye contact

17:03.493 --> 17:05.251
when we were both in line
for the bathroom a while ago.

17:05.252 --> 17:07.877
I don't think so. I...

17:07.878 --> 17:10.244
Anyway, um, it's good to see you.

17:10.313 --> 17:11.748
Not you. I hate you.

17:12.191 --> 17:13.218
- What?
- Yeah!

17:13.219 --> 17:16.151
You dumped me out of nowhere,
so of course I hate you.

17:16.219 --> 17:17.553
It just sounds funny
because I'm whispering.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.088
Because I don't want to wake
the baby up because...

17:19.155 --> 17:20.355
And thank you.

17:20.423 --> 17:23.092
Now she's awake.

17:23.159 --> 17:24.449
You just can't stop hurting me.

17:24.450 --> 17:26.372
Okay, here we go. I'm gonna trade you.

17:26.373 --> 17:28.163
You take her.

17:28.231 --> 17:29.765
She doesn't like to bounced, okay?

17:29.833 --> 17:31.100
I hate you.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.612
Not you. I love you.

17:49.119 --> 17:50.019
Hey.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.521
Hi.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.457
Just getting some fresh air.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.262
Where's Kristen?

17:57.264 --> 18:00.057
Uh, Kristen needed a break...

18:01.439 --> 18:03.506
From me.

18:06.626 --> 18:07.593
Where's Adam?

18:07.694 --> 18:09.428
Uh, Adam went home.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.765
Ah.

18:13.514 --> 18:14.567
Uh, well...

18:14.634 --> 18:16.502
I'll... I'll leave you alone.

18:16.570 --> 18:18.322
I think my marriage is over.

18:21.228 --> 18:23.877
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.611
Mm, you gonna say something or...?

18:33.453 --> 18:35.084
I don't know what to say.

18:35.789 --> 18:37.790
Well, that's a first.

18:39.526 --> 18:43.095
If anybody can get
through this, you can.

18:43.882 --> 18:44.981
Okay.

18:44.982 --> 18:48.100
No, no, I'm not...
I'm not just saying that.

18:48.102 --> 18:49.308
You're... you're...

18:50.170 --> 18:52.138
you're tough...

18:52.205 --> 18:54.406
and, uh... and persistent

18:54.474 --> 18:56.375
and decisive.

18:56.443 --> 18:59.664
Mm. Kind of sounds like you're
calling me stubborn.

18:59.665 --> 19:03.115
Yeah, well...

19:03.183 --> 19:04.416
you are insanely stubborn and...

19:04.484 --> 19:05.592
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

19:05.593 --> 19:07.386
- A little domineering...
- Uh-huh.

19:07.454 --> 19:08.420
Caustic maybe.

19:08.488 --> 19:09.414
- Caustic?
- Yeah.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.257
When I catch you before coffee time...

19:11.957 --> 19:14.727
You're downright hostile.

19:14.794 --> 19:16.495
Yeah.

19:16.563 --> 19:18.164
Yeah, you're not wrong.

19:18.231 --> 19:19.271
Yeah.

19:19.295 --> 19:22.877
So just, like, in general,
a pretty unpleasant person.

19:22.878 --> 19:25.104
- Yeah, pretty unpleasant, yeah.
- Okay.

19:25.172 --> 19:26.998
Notice.

19:29.393 --> 19:33.312
But you're also the most honest
person that I've ever met.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.909
And you're strong

19:38.485 --> 19:39.663
and smart...

19:41.021 --> 19:42.087
and funny,

19:42.322 --> 19:46.258
and you're confident and caring,

19:46.326 --> 19:49.528
and you're sexy and...

19:49.596 --> 19:50.578
Um...

19:51.624 --> 19:52.366
That... I didn't...

19:52.368 --> 19:53.718
- No, I...
- I wasn't try...

19:53.719 --> 19:55.558
- That was just me...
- Uh, yeah. No, I...

19:55.559 --> 19:56.658
- I so didn't...
- No No

19:56.660 --> 19:57.462
I had a few drinks.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.487
It's fine. I just...

19:58.488 --> 20:01.129
I think that it's time
to cut the cake, so...

20:01.684 --> 20:03.536
I'm just... I'm gonna go inside.

20:04.223 --> 20:05.423
Okay. Yeah.

20:05.593 --> 20:07.460
Um... thank you.

20:07.554 --> 20:08.521
Thanks, yeah.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.388
Hello.

20:24.563 --> 20:25.454
Oh.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.786
Did you forget something?

20:28.787 --> 20:30.040
Yeah.

20:30.870 --> 20:32.264
I forgot to do this.

20:33.764 --> 20:34.864
Oh, um...

20:35.067 --> 20:36.500
is it okay if I kiss you?

20:37.024 --> 20:37.836
Okay.

20:40.416 --> 20:42.902
Hey, everyone,
Bo and I just want to say thanks

20:42.903 --> 20:45.277
for making our wedding so dope.

20:45.691 --> 20:48.938
Oh, and shout-out to Boonville
Women's Correctional Facility

20:48.939 --> 20:51.397
for letting my mom Skype in
during the ceremony.

20:51.399 --> 20:52.971
Where's Jeff?

20:52.979 --> 20:54.111
Looks like he's leaving.

20:54.112 --> 20:56.927
To see the love in here
and have my work family

20:56.928 --> 20:59.814
and my real family and my friend family

20:59.814 --> 21:01.267
and my mall family and...

21:01.327 --> 21:03.385
To piggyback on Cheyenne,

21:03.386 --> 21:05.376
at Cloud 9, we're not just coworkers.

21:05.377 --> 21:07.265
We're a family.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.532
Jeff, please don't make
me fire my family!

21:19.103 --> 21:21.643
Right. Who's ready
to do the Chicken Dance?
