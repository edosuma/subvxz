00:45.829 --> 00:47.829
(horse clip-clopping)

00:47.897 --> 00:51.566
Do you, William, take this
woman to thy wedded wife,

00:51.634 --> 00:56.037
to love her, comfort her,
to honour and keep her,

00:56.105 --> 00:57.939
in sickness and in health,

00:58.007 --> 01:00.074
till death do ye part?

01:00.142 --> 01:03.143
- I do.
- And do you,

01:03.211 --> 01:06.146
Julia Ogden, take this
man to thy wedded husband,

01:06.214 --> 01:08.816
- to obey him...
- Obey him?

01:08.884 --> 01:10.718
Uh...

01:10.785 --> 01:12.786
we're negotiating that.

01:12.854 --> 01:14.722
(guests laughing)

01:14.789 --> 01:17.424
(pounding on door)

01:17.492 --> 01:19.325
It's Darcy!

01:19.393 --> 01:21.995
(pounding on door)

01:25.065 --> 01:27.099
(knocking on door)

01:29.403 --> 01:32.572
Sir, get dressed quickly.
You have to see this.

01:34.741 --> 01:36.909
- (man): What is it?
- (people talking frantically)

01:36.976 --> 01:39.477
(man): Get the children inside!

01:43.315 --> 01:44.850
(horse neighing)

01:46.819 --> 01:48.453
Where'd it go, George?

01:48.521 --> 01:50.855
- Behind that building, sir.
- What building?

01:50.923 --> 01:53.257
The bank, sir, the bank!

01:55.594 --> 01:57.528
We have to get up on one of these roofs.

01:57.596 --> 01:59.263
Sir. Listen.

01:59.330 --> 02:01.398
(airplane propeller)

02:01.466 --> 02:04.468
- It's coming back.
- This direction.

02:07.905 --> 02:09.372
It's not here, George.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.908
You must have heard the sound
reflecting off of a building.

02:11.976 --> 02:15.211
(airplane propeller) Sir!

02:19.917 --> 02:21.918
My God.

02:21.986 --> 02:23.986
(George): I believe it's landing.

02:24.054 --> 02:26.589
Not landing.

02:28.725 --> 02:30.159
(loud crash)

02:30.227 --> 02:31.660
(people shouting)

02:31.728 --> 02:34.130
(people shouting) (horse neighing)

02:34.198 --> 02:36.232
(sizzling)

02:38.235 --> 02:41.903
Sir, a few people were
struck by light debris,

02:41.971 --> 02:45.340
but apart from that no one
seems seriously injured.

02:45.408 --> 02:47.909
What have we got, Murdoch?

02:47.977 --> 02:50.712
Sir, some sort of flying machine.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.514
Flying machine?

02:52.582 --> 02:55.682
- Yes, sir. I saw it with my own eyes; so did George.
- Sirs.

02:55.750 --> 02:58.685
Looks like we have a body here in the shed.

03:00.622 --> 03:04.691
Poor bugger. I'll bet that was
the last thing he was expecting.

03:04.759 --> 03:06.760
Sir, I think the pilot
is still in the machine.

03:06.828 --> 03:08.695
Be careful, George. Don't
touch any of the metal.

03:08.763 --> 03:10.864
It may still be hot.

03:10.932 --> 03:12.465
Good God!

03:12.533 --> 03:13.423
What the jumping hell is that?

03:14.669 --> 03:17.203
It appears to be a pig-like creature.

03:17.671 --> 03:20.206
Pig-like?

03:20.274 --> 03:24.244
Sir, I don't think we should
assume the entity is of this planet.

03:24.311 --> 03:26.513
Bloody hell, Murdoch.
You don't think that...

03:26.580 --> 03:30.115
No sir, I don't think the pig
was in control of the aircraft.

03:30.183 --> 03:32.217
Then who was?

03:41.013 --> 03:43.582
Well, if ever there was a
debate over which came first...

03:43.650 --> 03:46.619
the day that hell freezes over or
the day that pigs fly... this ends it.

03:46.686 --> 03:48.120
Very good, sir.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.822
How did the bloody thing stay in the air?

03:50.890 --> 03:53.859
- It may have been transmitted control.
- What?

03:53.926 --> 03:58.730
Nikola Tesla created a device for
transmitted control a few years ago.

03:58.797 --> 04:01.266
He used it to remotely
control a small boat.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.135
The same technology could be
applied to a flying machine.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.337
What about the pig?

04:06.405 --> 04:11.208
Well, whoever was controlling the vehicle
may have wanted to test a weighted craft.

04:11.277 --> 04:12.709
Over a crowded bloody city.

04:12.777 --> 04:14.711
The reckless bastard.
He killed a man, Murdoch!

04:14.779 --> 04:17.648
And why a pig? Why not a sack of spuds?

04:17.714 --> 04:20.483
I don't know, sir.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.218
Dr. Grace?

04:22.287 --> 04:24.821
All indications are he
was struck down by debris

04:24.889 --> 04:27.257
and then died in the ensuing conflagration.

04:27.325 --> 04:31.560
Right. Look for any indicators of
identity. We'll need to notify next of kin.

04:31.628 --> 04:34.263
- What about the pig?
- Uh...

04:34.331 --> 04:37.965
See if there is anything that will tell
us which abattoir it may have come from.

04:38.033 --> 04:39.967
Doctor.

04:40.035 --> 04:42.337
Sirs, about this pig.

04:42.405 --> 04:44.872
I don't think we should
rule out the possibility

04:44.940 --> 04:47.676
that it is a creature not of this world.

04:47.743 --> 04:49.977
- Oh, here we go.
- George,

04:50.045 --> 04:52.414
don't you think it highly
unlikely that a creature

04:52.481 --> 04:55.916
from another planet would look
exactly like an earthly pig?

04:55.983 --> 04:59.085
Parallel evolution,
sir, except on his planet

04:59.153 --> 05:01.021
pigs became the dominant species.

05:01.088 --> 05:03.324
They are very clever;
some say smarter than dogs.

05:03.391 --> 05:05.826
Do dogs fly bloody aircraft, Crabtree?

05:05.893 --> 05:07.628
Not ones that we know.

05:07.696 --> 05:09.629
You two can handle this.

05:09.697 --> 05:12.131
I have a young man that needs my advice.

05:12.199 --> 05:13.251
Carry on. 

05:14.552 --> 05:16.609
George, have the men collect the craft, 

05:16.736 --> 05:19.905
and have them take careful note
of where every piece was found.

05:19.973 --> 05:22.107
I want every piece accounted for.

05:22.175 --> 05:24.377
And have them take it to
the warehouse on Governor St.

05:24.445 --> 05:26.378
- Sir.
- Thank you.

05:28.914 --> 05:30.849
I envy you, son.

05:30.916 --> 05:33.518
Serving in Her Majesty's army
was one of the great honours

05:33.586 --> 05:35.687
of my life. When do you ship out?

05:35.755 --> 05:38.724
I should be face to face
with the Boers soon enough.

05:38.791 --> 05:41.259
Bloody Boers declaring war on us.

05:41.327 --> 05:44.528
Fine young men like you will
show them what a mistake that was.

05:44.596 --> 05:46.831
In fact, I've half a mind to join you.

05:46.898 --> 05:49.066
Really. At your age?

05:49.133 --> 05:51.802
I'd still be more than
a match for any Afrikaans

05:51.870 --> 05:54.572
that I come up against, Arthur my old son.

05:57.575 --> 05:59.942
- Julia!
- William!

06:00.010 --> 06:04.614
- My goodness! When did you get back from Vienna?
- Last night.

06:04.682 --> 06:07.584
You look wonderful!
I'm so happy to see you.

06:07.651 --> 06:10.052
I missed you so much, William.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.888
Oh, as did I.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.657
So, this is your flying machine?

06:15.725 --> 06:17.158
What's left of it.

06:17.226 --> 06:19.862
How fascinating. What a
shame it was destroyed.

06:19.929 --> 06:22.063
Yes. I'm hoping to reconstruct it.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.332
William, what do you know about this?

06:24.401 --> 06:28.103
Well, I've studied the flying
machines by Otto Lilienthal.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.205
But isn't this craft different?
I heard it had a motor.

06:31.273 --> 06:34.442
Well, yes, it did, I
believe gasoline powered.

06:34.510 --> 06:37.879
But the principles of
aerodynamics are the same.

06:37.946 --> 06:39.881
If I can reconstruct the debris...

06:39.948 --> 06:42.182
A three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.018
What fun!

06:53.461 --> 06:56.496
I've yet to find any indications
of the man's identity.

06:56.564 --> 07:00.033
Hmm. What about the pig? Have
you conducted a postmortem?

07:00.100 --> 07:02.200
I didn't think it necessary.

07:02.268 --> 07:04.437
I was wondering if his internal

07:04.504 --> 07:07.072
constitution is the same
as the ones here on Earth.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.809
- George, what are you eating?
- Oh, it's called

07:09.876 --> 07:12.745
a hot hamburger. It's
really quite delicious.

07:12.813 --> 07:15.848
And you can carry it around in
your hand. Would you like a bite?

07:15.916 --> 07:18.950
Hot meat and bread
together? I should think not.

07:19.017 --> 07:22.253
You must have a strong
constitution. As to your pig,

07:22.321 --> 07:24.322
he is very much of this earth,

07:24.389 --> 07:26.758
slaughtered by the usual means. Hmm.

07:26.826 --> 07:29.360
This metal is extraordinarily light.

07:29.428 --> 07:31.930
Aluminium; similar strength to steel,

07:31.997 --> 07:34.898
but one third of the
density, 20 times the cost.

07:34.966 --> 07:37.835
Whoever built this had money.

07:42.139 --> 07:44.875
That looks more electrical than mechanical.

07:44.943 --> 07:47.043
Excellent observation.

07:47.111 --> 07:49.846
Sir. Doctor.

07:49.913 --> 07:52.815
- I have some interesting news.
- What have you, George?

07:52.883 --> 07:55.651
Well, firstly, as you suspected...

07:55.719 --> 07:57.954
the pig is just a pig.

07:58.021 --> 08:00.022
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

08:00.090 --> 08:02.925
Oh, that's quite all right, sir. It's
given us another avenue of inquiry.

08:02.993 --> 08:06.327
We found a stamp on the pig, which
not only tells us the slaughterhouse,

08:06.395 --> 08:09.230
but also the date on which it was...

08:09.298 --> 08:12.734
Now, as it turns out, there were
64 pigs slaughtered that day;

08:12.802 --> 08:14.936
most of them were sold dressed,

08:15.004 --> 08:18.907
but have a look who bought a whole one.

08:18.975 --> 08:21.809
James Pendrick.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.444
- Can you try him again, please?
- (door opening)

08:24.513 --> 08:26.279
Yes, again.

08:26.347 --> 08:27.815
Ah...

08:27.883 --> 08:30.450
Yes, and let it ring. It's
a matter of some importance

08:30.519 --> 08:32.586
that I contact this man.

08:41.094 --> 08:42.529
It crashed.

08:42.596 --> 08:44.430
Where?

08:44.498 --> 08:46.799
- Downtown Toronto.
- Impossible.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.536
Mr. Pendrick, you were
testing a flying craft

08:49.603 --> 08:51.771
over a crowded city and now a man is dead!

08:51.839 --> 08:53.572
Oh, dear Lord.

08:57.043 --> 09:00.378
I relinquished control of
the aircraft to my assistant,

09:00.446 --> 09:03.615
Mr. Matthews, earlier this morning. It
was part of a test we were conducting.

09:03.683 --> 09:06.785
You're telling me your assistant
lost control of the craft?

09:06.853 --> 09:09.120
No. He would have known what he was doing.

09:09.188 --> 09:12.489
- Where is he, then?
- I've been trying to contact him.

09:15.928 --> 09:18.029
I've been betrayed, Murdoch.

09:18.096 --> 09:21.065
Once again. There's
something sinister at work.

09:23.869 --> 09:26.502
Do you see this?

09:26.571 --> 09:29.973
It was attached to this.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.875
A microphone.

09:31.943 --> 09:35.344
Yes. I followed the wire
to the carriage house.

09:35.412 --> 09:39.182
- Who would be listening to you?
- One of my competitors, obviously.

09:39.249 --> 09:41.150
Have you heard of the Mortimer Challenge?

09:41.218 --> 09:42.851
No.

09:42.919 --> 09:45.117
He's an oil tycoon by the
name of Samuel Mortimer.

09:45.118 --> 09:49.124
He put up a million dollars to the first
man who can achieve controlled flight.

09:49.192 --> 09:51.093
- A million dollars!
- Yes.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.396
You understand the stakes now.

09:54.464 --> 09:58.399
Any fool can get a flying
machine off the ground.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.869
It's a matter of reducing weight and drag

10:01.937 --> 10:06.440
and maximizing speed and wing surface.

10:08.443 --> 10:10.878
The problem is: how do
you turn the damn thing?

10:10.946 --> 10:12.947
A rudder?

10:13.015 --> 10:15.849
Yes, well, a rudder needs a keel,

10:15.917 --> 10:17.517
something to press against.

10:17.585 --> 10:20.253
Of course, you can't have
a keel on a flying machine.

10:20.321 --> 10:22.889
Solution: tilt the plane,

10:22.957 --> 10:24.758
use the wings as a keel.

10:24.826 --> 10:27.761
Ah, but how do you tilt the plane?

10:27.829 --> 10:30.362
That is a question to
which I have the answer.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.297
That's what they're after.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.299
(alarm bell ringing)

10:34.367 --> 10:36.002
The Arrow.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.271
(ringing stops)

10:39.339 --> 10:41.073
Who's there?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.075
(shuffling nearby)

10:43.143 --> 10:46.277
Matthews?

10:46.345 --> 10:48.479
Matthews.

10:51.216 --> 10:53.618
Must be those damn racoons.

11:00.292 --> 11:04.361
Detective Murdoch, allow me
to officially introduce...

11:04.428 --> 11:07.064
the Pendrick Arrow.

11:07.132 --> 11:09.266
But the test craft...

11:09.333 --> 11:11.268
Was just a test craft.

11:11.335 --> 11:14.304
This is the aircraft I intend to fly.

11:14.372 --> 11:17.274
Mr. Pendrick, I have to ask:

11:17.341 --> 11:18.975
why a pig?

11:19.043 --> 11:21.310
I was testing a harness.

11:21.378 --> 11:23.279
There's no point in
trying to secure oneself

11:23.346 --> 11:25.548
if the end result is slow
death from organ rupture.

11:25.615 --> 11:28.084
How were the organs, by the way?

11:28.152 --> 11:29.886
Oh, I wouldn't know.

11:29.953 --> 11:32.321
But I'd be more concerned
about burning to death.

11:32.389 --> 11:36.158
Yes. Yes, that is a problem.

11:36.225 --> 11:38.694
(dart shot)

11:38.761 --> 11:41.362
Mr. Pendrick?

11:41.430 --> 11:43.464
(dart shot)

12:02.585 --> 12:04.619
<i>They've taken it.</i>

12:04.687 --> 12:06.721
They've taken the Arrow.

12:17.299 --> 12:20.068
- The asylum?
- Yes, I start next week.

12:20.135 --> 12:22.670
From coroner to psychiatrist.

12:22.737 --> 12:24.839
What other surprises do you have in mind?

12:24.906 --> 12:27.175
Well, I hope to go from
married to unmarried.

12:27.242 --> 12:29.910
I retained a lawyer.

12:29.979 --> 12:31.744
Wish me luck.

12:31.812 --> 12:33.646
You have it.

12:36.451 --> 12:39.019
You should sign up for
the military, Crabtree.

12:39.087 --> 12:41.088
War tests the measure of a man.

12:41.155 --> 12:43.123
Sir, I'm not sure I want to be measured.

12:43.191 --> 12:45.125
Thomas, what is this foolishness?

12:45.193 --> 12:47.559
Robert said he saw you
taking your old uniform

12:47.627 --> 12:50.562
out of the attic. Oh, don't
bother, Constable Crabtree.

12:50.630 --> 12:53.065
I know full well what you were doing.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.834
You must be an excellent
cook, Mrs. Brackenreid.

12:55.902 --> 12:58.971
It's not my cooking that's made him
stout. What sort of a fool are you?

12:59.039 --> 13:01.640
Going off to fight a war at your age!

13:01.708 --> 13:03.908
Sir. Ah, Mrs. Brackenreid.

13:03.976 --> 13:07.178
Sir, I have Mr. Pendrick
in the interview room.

13:07.246 --> 13:10.382
Perhaps you ought to sit in on this one.

13:10.449 --> 13:12.583
Too old to fight a war?

13:12.651 --> 13:15.020
Seems like I fight one with
the missus every single night.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.156
(She scoffs.)

13:18.224 --> 13:20.591
I received a letter. It
was a personal invitation,

13:20.659 --> 13:23.528
but I assumed that other gentleman
scientists received the same.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.496
A million dollars is to be awarded

13:25.564 --> 13:27.798
- to the first man to fly.
- Not just fly;

13:27.866 --> 13:30.968
each recipient had to perform a figure
eight over a distance of one mile

13:31.036 --> 13:34.338
with a hundred-pound load
in addition to the pilot.

13:34.406 --> 13:36.673
That was to be achieved by July 1st.

13:36.741 --> 13:38.775
So, you think your
flying machine was stolen

13:38.843 --> 13:40.844
to prevent you from
winning the competition.

13:40.912 --> 13:43.246
- Obviously.
- What about the test craft?

13:43.313 --> 13:45.960
Deliberately crashed to
prevent me from using it to win.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.710
In the middle of a large city?

13:47.919 --> 13:51.254
That was intended to destroy my reputation.

13:53.590 --> 13:56.358
Remain in contact, Mr. Pendrick.

13:56.426 --> 13:59.294
If you have any further
insights, please bring them to us.

13:59.362 --> 14:02.865
And do not take the
law into your own hands.

14:02.933 --> 14:05.500
Then find my Arrow, Murdoch.

14:05.569 --> 14:08.102
My financial future depends on it.

14:08.170 --> 14:12.106
Ah, yes, regarding that,
Mr. Pendrick, if I may...

14:12.174 --> 14:15.610
I thought you were financially ruined.

14:15.678 --> 14:17.845
I was, thanks to you.

14:17.913 --> 14:22.149
Well, then, where did you
get the funds to do this?

14:22.217 --> 14:24.885
Reginald Gleason, an investor.

14:24.953 --> 14:27.353
We agreed to split the prize money 50-50.

14:27.421 --> 14:29.222
Risky move on his part.

14:29.290 --> 14:33.460
Hmm. In my opinion, it's
riskier to bet against me.

14:35.429 --> 14:37.163
I don't trust him. Is there even

14:37.231 --> 14:40.066
the slightest chance he
could be mixed up in this?

14:40.133 --> 14:43.402
I don't see how this could
possibly be to his advantage.

14:43.470 --> 14:46.806
- Right then. Let's talk to the competition.
- Right.

14:46.873 --> 14:49.909
♪

15:17.669 --> 15:20.337
Not a decent suspect
amongst the lot of them.

15:20.404 --> 15:23.874
None of them seemed even close
to making the July 1st deadline.

15:23.942 --> 15:26.010
I thought the two from Ohio had potential.

15:26.077 --> 15:28.111
- The Wright brothers?
- Well, at least they had

15:28.178 --> 15:30.146
something that looked
like it could actually fly.

15:30.213 --> 15:33.783
Hm. I'll have George look into
this Samuel Mortimer fellow.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.385
You think he might be behind this?

15:36.453 --> 15:39.722
Well, if the money is committed, this
would be one way of not having to pay it.

15:39.790 --> 15:42.458
Then why make the offer in the first place?

15:47.596 --> 15:49.031
Julia?

15:49.098 --> 15:50.732
Is everything all right?

15:50.800 --> 15:54.036
Yes. I just came by to tell
you I've talked to my lawyer.

15:54.103 --> 15:57.405
He thinks that Darcy and I
should obtain an annulment.

15:57.473 --> 16:01.408
An annulment? Is that even possible?

16:01.476 --> 16:04.712
If we swear that our marriage
was never consummated.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.616
Darcy would have to agree to that.

16:09.685 --> 16:13.320
I think he might, to avoid
the scandal of divorce.

16:13.388 --> 16:16.823
- Hm.
- I'm going to have dinner with him tonight.

16:30.071 --> 16:31.671
What have you, George?

16:31.738 --> 16:35.240
Oh, sir. I was expecting...

16:35.308 --> 16:38.010
well, I wasn't expecting this.

16:38.078 --> 16:39.712
It's like a magic suit.

16:39.779 --> 16:41.847
Put it on and you're
instantly 20 years younger.

16:41.915 --> 16:44.149
I was going to say.

16:44.217 --> 16:47.219
I've signed up, Murdoch. Just got
back from the recruitment centre.

16:47.286 --> 16:50.188
- You... I beg your pardon?
- Oh, it's only for a few months.

16:50.255 --> 16:52.690
- The war will be over by then.
- But, sir...

16:52.758 --> 16:55.093
I just wanted to stand up
and be counted, that's all.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.128
Now, what's all this?

16:57.196 --> 17:01.099
I'm testing the darts, sir.
It's very sophisticated stuff.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.467
The chemical was held in a reservoir

17:03.535 --> 17:05.969
and then forcibly ejected
when it hit the skin.

17:06.037 --> 17:07.704
What kind of chemical?

17:07.771 --> 17:09.271
Some sort of anaesthetic.

17:09.339 --> 17:10.773
Can you identify it?

17:10.842 --> 17:12.876
It's not like anything I've ever seen, sir.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.878
Sinister forces indeed. (knocking on door)

17:15.946 --> 17:17.914
- What have you, George?
- Sirs, it would seem

17:17.982 --> 17:20.915
the contest is bona fide.
A million dollars was ta...

17:20.983 --> 17:24.119
Oh, deep breath, sir. There you are.

17:24.186 --> 17:26.555
A million dollars was
taken out of an account

17:26.623 --> 17:28.557
under the name of Samuel Mortimer

17:28.625 --> 17:30.626
and placed in trust with
the Bank of Toronto, to be

17:30.693 --> 17:33.562
released to the winner if the
terms of the challenge are met.

17:33.630 --> 17:36.798
So if Pendrick succeeds, this
Mortimer is down a million dollars.

17:36.866 --> 17:39.167
What did you find out

17:39.235 --> 17:41.803
- about Samuel Mortimer himself?
- Well, that's the thing, sir.

17:41.871 --> 17:46.474
Aside from his name being on the account,
nobody seems to have heard of him.

17:46.541 --> 17:49.010
Despite the condition of the corpse,

17:49.078 --> 17:51.279
there were a couple of
things that gave me pause...

17:51.346 --> 17:53.781
the pattern of the burns,
the position of the body.

17:53.848 --> 17:57.717
Both these things suggest that this man
was lying on his back at the time of impact.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.587
And, given what I could
tell of his clothing,

18:00.655 --> 18:02.823
he didn't appear to be
a workman taking a nap.

18:02.891 --> 18:05.092
I decided that there was a possibility

18:05.160 --> 18:07.594
that this man may be a victim
of a homicide that would have

18:07.662 --> 18:09.762
occurred before he was
struck by the flying machine.

18:09.830 --> 18:13.432
Yes, of course.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.004
- Dr. Grace, what are you eating?
- Oh, a hot hamburger.

18:18.071 --> 18:20.106
Terribly popular. Would you like to try?

18:20.174 --> 18:23.809
- No.
- Your loss.

18:23.876 --> 18:27.179
So, I decided to look at
poisoning as the cause of death.

18:27.246 --> 18:30.715
I emptied the stomach contents,
and that's where I found these.

18:37.222 --> 18:38.623
<i>(Brackenreid): He swallowed them?</i>

18:38.691 --> 18:41.258
Tore it into pieces,
likely to make the task

18:41.326 --> 18:45.395
easier. It appears to
be a cipher of some sort.

18:45.463 --> 18:48.966
What are the odds, Murdoch, that the
shed that the flying machine crashed into

18:49.034 --> 18:51.468
just happened to contain a dead body?

18:51.536 --> 18:53.503
Very low, I should think.

18:53.571 --> 18:56.439
- So who's our victim?
- I don't know.

18:56.506 --> 18:58.641
Mr. Pendrick's assistant is still missing.

18:58.709 --> 19:00.476
I've asked him to come in.

19:00.544 --> 19:02.545
So, we have a millionaire
that doesn't exist,

19:02.612 --> 19:04.513
but a million dollars that does.

19:04.581 --> 19:06.515
We have dead bodies, coded notes,

19:06.583 --> 19:09.719
special darts, and exotic poison.

19:09.786 --> 19:12.254
You know who I think
is behind this, Murdoch?

19:14.324 --> 19:17.826
- Terrence Meyers.
- Exactly. - No, sir.

19:17.894 --> 19:22.097
Terrence Meyers just walked
into the station house.

19:22.165 --> 19:25.834
Gentlemen. I shall presently
be taking possession of a corpse

19:25.902 --> 19:28.702
currently undergoing an
autopsy in your morgue.

19:28.770 --> 19:33.407
- I trust you have no objections.
- Oy. Let me see some authority, Meyers.

19:33.475 --> 19:35.576
Ah, of course.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.578
Will you be wanting the pig too?

19:37.645 --> 19:40.081
Uh... no. Keep the pig.

19:40.148 --> 19:42.183
Is the victim an agent of the government?

19:42.251 --> 19:44.985
I'm afraid that's top secret.

19:45.052 --> 19:47.287
Did you steal the
Pendrick Arrow, Mr. Meyers?

19:47.355 --> 19:50.090
I have no idea what you're talking about.

19:50.157 --> 19:52.759
So you're telling us
it's just a coincidence

19:52.826 --> 19:54.995
that your agent's body was put into a shed

19:55.062 --> 19:58.031
that Pendrick's test
craft later crashed into.

19:58.099 --> 20:01.800
Well, I never said he was an agent,

20:01.868 --> 20:03.668
but if I did, then, yes,

20:03.736 --> 20:06.638
yes, that's what I would be
saying. Good day, gentlemen.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.446
Could this be your assistant Matthews?

20:14.514 --> 20:17.148
Were the missing teeth pre-or postmortem?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.950
Pre.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.487
Then that's him, the poor devil.

20:23.555 --> 20:27.292
Then how is it that the
craft crashed into him?

20:27.359 --> 20:29.294
I thought he was operating it.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.495
I thought so too.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.964
What's going on here, Detective?

20:34.032 --> 20:36.599
Mr. Pendrick, I believe

20:36.667 --> 20:39.569
your assistant may have been
working for someone else.

20:39.637 --> 20:41.972
Damn him!

20:49.146 --> 20:51.513
Was it raining where
you were earlier today?

20:53.516 --> 20:57.320
We had a brief thunderstorm. Why?

20:57.387 --> 21:01.457
Both Mr. Meyers and Mr. Pendrick
had mud spatter on their pants.

21:01.524 --> 21:03.426
You think they were
caught in the same storm?

21:03.493 --> 21:05.893
Well, it stands to reason
that if you're going to steal

21:05.962 --> 21:09.364
a flying machine, you won't want
to go very far in broad daylight.

21:09.432 --> 21:11.232
Look here, Murdoch.

21:11.300 --> 21:14.769
The road that runs north
of Pendrick's property.

21:14.837 --> 21:17.172
Concession 51.

21:17.239 --> 21:21.141
Do you recall a certain government
airship being tested on Concession 51?

21:38.759 --> 21:40.660
(groan)

21:40.728 --> 21:44.196
(gun hammer cocked) Turn around.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.298
Slowly.

21:48.267 --> 21:50.302
Arthurs.

21:54.908 --> 21:56.942
He'll live.

21:57.010 --> 21:59.177
Where is my flying machine?

21:59.245 --> 22:00.945
The Pendrick Arrow?

22:01.013 --> 22:03.214
You claimed you didn't take it.

22:03.281 --> 22:06.484
Of course we took it. It was in
the interest of national security.

22:06.552 --> 22:08.119
Ah.

22:08.186 --> 22:10.287
Well, then,

22:10.355 --> 22:12.390
who stole it from you?

22:14.359 --> 22:16.393
I have no idea.

22:24.573 --> 22:27.575
<i>Detective, what could you possibly
offer me that I don't already know?</i>

22:27.643 --> 22:29.243
Hmm?

22:29.310 --> 22:30.845
It's possible

22:30.912 --> 22:35.315
we found a coded note
in Mr. Matthews' stomach.

22:35.383 --> 22:37.985
A note. What note? Where is it?

22:38.053 --> 22:41.122
It's a hypothetical note, to
be hypothetically transferred

22:41.189 --> 22:45.825
to you on the understanding
that you tell us everything.

22:50.697 --> 22:54.234
What I'm about to tell you can never
leave the confines of this room,

22:54.301 --> 22:56.636
- under penalty of...
- Yes, yes, treason.

22:56.703 --> 23:00.272
- Death penalty.
- Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

23:00.339 --> 23:02.474
We are at war, gentlemen,

23:02.541 --> 23:05.778
and the need for a flying military
vehicle has never been greater.

23:05.845 --> 23:09.114
That's why you insisted on the hundred-pound
payload. You intend to bomb the enemy.

23:09.182 --> 23:12.717
Among other things. Obviously,
whoever controls the skies will

23:12.786 --> 23:14.820
- have tremendous advantage.
- (Brackenreid scoffs.)

23:14.888 --> 23:16.788
Bloody flying machines will never replace

23:16.855 --> 23:19.723
- a well-drilled infantry.
- So, you present yourself

23:19.792 --> 23:24.228
as Samuel Mortimer, a wealthy
industrialist planning a grand contest.

23:24.296 --> 23:27.832
We became aware that a number of
avionauts had made significant progress

23:27.900 --> 23:29.901
in the area of manned
flight, and we thought

23:29.968 --> 23:32.335
that a financial incentive
would accelerate progress.

23:32.403 --> 23:34.604
So, how does Matthews
fit in to all of this?

23:34.672 --> 23:38.775
He became aware that certain foreign
agents were monitoring Pendrick's progress.

23:38.843 --> 23:42.612
But we won't know until
we decode that message.

23:51.922 --> 23:53.755
What does it mean?

23:56.159 --> 23:58.894
I'm afraid that's top
secret. Good day, gentlemen.

23:58.962 --> 24:02.564
Bloody hell. I knew we couldn't trust him!

24:02.632 --> 24:05.200
You remember the code, right?

24:05.267 --> 24:07.735
I'm due for training.

24:07.803 --> 24:09.670
Get to the bottom of this, Murdoch.

24:09.738 --> 24:11.772
I'll do my best, sir.

24:14.376 --> 24:16.845
Stand up straight, boy.

24:16.912 --> 24:20.447
We will begin our day with
a little bit of limbering up.

24:20.514 --> 24:24.384
Fifty push-ups followed by a five-mile run.

24:24.452 --> 24:27.787
And then we will proceed
to the obstacle course.

24:27.856 --> 24:30.657
It is our preference that our soldiers die

24:30.725 --> 24:33.493
on the battlefield and
not the training ground.

24:33.561 --> 24:36.595
I'm an active policeman.
I'm more than capable

24:36.663 --> 24:39.198
of the rigours required for
military service, Sergeant.

24:39.266 --> 24:42.101
Is that right? Good.

24:42.169 --> 24:45.804
Fifty push-ups. Go! All of you!

24:49.943 --> 24:51.877
Bloody hell. Bollocks.

24:51.944 --> 24:56.047
The Pendrick Arrow was never
intended for military use.

24:56.115 --> 24:58.350
- Don't be naive.
- Well, who are

24:58.417 --> 25:00.886
these supposed foreign agents? The Boers?

25:00.953 --> 25:01.910
We don't know. 

25:01.911 --> 25:04.435
But we certainly don't want
your flying machine in the hands

25:04.436 --> 25:06.358
of someone who could use it against us.

25:06.425 --> 25:08.692
You needn't worry about that.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.095
Whoever attempts to fly the Arrow will be

25:11.162 --> 25:14.164
- in for a big surprise.
- What do you mean?

25:14.232 --> 25:17.968
The very feature that makes the
Arrow navigable, the tilters,

25:18.036 --> 25:21.138
have been removed from the
aircraft and kept in secret storage.

25:21.206 --> 25:25.341
As you know, I had reason to be suspicious.

25:25.409 --> 25:29.445
- Does anyone else know about the these tilters?
- No one.

25:29.513 --> 25:32.548
- Not even Matthews.
- What about Mr. Gleason,

25:32.616 --> 25:34.884
your financial backer
with the deep pockets?

25:34.952 --> 25:39.088
Well, he certainly knows I've
perfected a system of navigation.

25:39.156 --> 25:42.224
- He doesn't know how it works.
- I'll need to see the particulars

25:42.292 --> 25:45.627
- of your agreement with him.
- Mr. Gleason can't be behind this.

25:45.694 --> 25:48.063
It was his money that paid for it all.

25:48.131 --> 25:52.334
No stone unturned.

25:52.402 --> 25:55.203
Get over that wall,
you old tub of guts! Go!

25:58.540 --> 26:00.374
Next!

26:00.442 --> 26:01.943
Need a boost, sir?

26:02.010 --> 26:03.978
Oh, get your bloody hands off me, lad!

26:11.853 --> 26:14.955
Aw! Oh, bloody hell.

26:16.924 --> 26:20.393
(panting) Next!

26:20.461 --> 26:22.829
- Sir?
- What is it?

26:22.896 --> 26:25.598
I conducted a trace of Pendrick's funds.

26:25.666 --> 26:29.969
He was wired money directly from
the Merchant Bank in Rochester...

26:30.036 --> 26:32.438
an account under the name Reginald Gleason.

26:32.505 --> 26:34.473
And the point, George?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.708
Reginald Gleason doesn't exist, sir.

26:36.776 --> 26:40.712
I see. Have you told Mr. Pendrick?

26:40.780 --> 26:42.714
- I was on my way.
- I'll tell him.

26:42.782 --> 26:44.815
Agh!

26:44.883 --> 26:47.986
No, no, no, Harry. Watch me. Watch.

26:48.053 --> 26:52.890
Thrust! Twist! Withdraw! Now you try it.

26:52.958 --> 26:55.893
- Ugh!
- Oh, that's better, lad!

26:55.961 --> 26:58.796
You do it like that, the poor
bugger'll never know what's hit him.

26:58.864 --> 27:02.232
Right, then, one more time, together.
Oh, and put some guts behind it.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.369
(both shouting)

27:05.436 --> 27:08.872
Mr. Brackenreid. A moment.

27:13.411 --> 27:17.013
If you're willing, I'm prepared to
shave five or six years off your age.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.181
It'll look better on your record.

27:19.249 --> 27:22.385
We could use a man like you
showing the Boer what for.

27:22.452 --> 27:24.387
Sergeant, uh,

27:24.454 --> 27:26.389
maybe 10?

27:26.456 --> 27:28.090
Carry on.

27:34.063 --> 27:36.097
Mr. Pendrick?

27:38.067 --> 27:39.600
Mr. Pendrick?

28:02.882 --> 28:05.449
Sir, do you think Mr. Pendrick is dead?

28:05.518 --> 28:08.319
No. I think it's more
likely he's been kidnapped.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.821
Oh, that's good.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.656
He's an interesting chap.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.824
Sir, why would they bother kidnapping him?

28:13.892 --> 28:15.826
They already have his flying machine.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.861
Because they can't fly it without him.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.898
You see, I believe Mr.
Pendrick removed something

28:20.965 --> 28:23.767
crucial to the craft,
something called the tilters,

28:23.835 --> 28:27.337
which allow the craft to bank into a turn.

28:29.306 --> 28:31.574
And you think now that they have him,

28:31.642 --> 28:34.577
they plan to extract
that information by force.

28:34.645 --> 28:36.178
Yes.

28:38.515 --> 28:41.383
Oh, sir, look. Do that again.

28:50.893 --> 28:53.361
This could be it, George.

28:53.429 --> 28:55.864
Yes. I believe these are the tilters.

28:55.932 --> 28:58.366
I'll need both of these straightaway.

28:58.434 --> 29:01.202
Yes, sir. Lads.

29:03.605 --> 29:05.739
By the way, Murdoch,

29:05.807 --> 29:09.076
I meant to tell you
earlier. I've been accepted.

29:09.143 --> 29:12.780
- Accepted?
- I have a duty to Queen and country.

29:12.847 --> 29:15.182
I intend not to shirk it. Thrust!

29:15.249 --> 29:17.951
Twist! Withdraw!

29:21.589 --> 29:24.891
Sir, I've brought the tilters.

29:24.959 --> 29:26.993
Just leave them there, George.

29:30.030 --> 29:32.465
This one's a real puzzler, isn't it, sir?

29:32.532 --> 29:34.733
Yes. It's not a simple cipher, George.

29:34.801 --> 29:37.903
Detective. Mr. Pendrick has been kidnapped.

29:37.971 --> 29:40.171
Yes. I'm aware of that.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.874
Are you now willing to
divulge the coded message?

29:42.942 --> 29:45.310
No. No, uh,

29:45.377 --> 29:49.747
apparently the message is not
encoded in any cipher we know, so...

29:49.815 --> 29:53.484
I need your help, Murdoch.

29:53.551 --> 29:55.920
Is that right?

29:55.988 --> 29:58.789
Well, perhaps it's not a cipher after all.

29:58.857 --> 30:01.726
Maybe it's just... numbers.

30:01.793 --> 30:05.096
Sir, today is May the 13th, correct?

30:05.163 --> 30:06.596
What of it?

30:06.664 --> 30:08.898
Because Pendrick's flying machine...

30:08.966 --> 30:12.602
was stolen yesterday, May the 12th.

30:12.670 --> 30:14.570
Very good, George,

30:14.639 --> 30:16.072
that's it.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.510
Five twelve is the date;
1115 could be the time.

30:20.577 --> 30:23.311
The time of what? His abduction?

30:23.379 --> 30:25.380
No, I don't think so.

30:25.448 --> 30:29.284
Sir, if they stole the flying craft,
they would have to transport it somehow.

30:29.352 --> 30:31.020
Yes, exactly.

30:31.087 --> 30:33.155
Now, they couldn't fly the machine.

30:33.222 --> 30:36.258
They would have had to use... a train!

30:36.325 --> 30:40.161
A train car could would be large enough
to transport the flying craft. George,

30:40.228 --> 30:43.330
see if any trains left
Willowdale station at 11:15,

30:43.398 --> 30:46.100
and see if box car 2473 was

30:46.168 --> 30:49.170
- routed anywhere in particular.
- Sir.

30:51.907 --> 30:54.675
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Meyers?

30:54.742 --> 30:56.309
No.

30:56.377 --> 30:58.344
Then I'm very busy.

31:36.615 --> 31:41.252
Sir, there was indeed an
11:15 train leaving Willowdale.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.386
What about box car 2473?

31:43.454 --> 31:45.488
Routed for Lewiston, New York.

31:45.556 --> 31:47.925
Just across the border.
So it WAS the Americans.

31:47.992 --> 31:49.927
Of course it was the Americans.

31:49.994 --> 31:52.062
Did you say, Lewiston, Constable?

31:52.130 --> 31:54.397
- I did.
- There's a decommissioned

31:54.465 --> 31:56.967
military base just outside of Lewiston.

31:57.035 --> 31:59.902
They don't know that we know about it.

31:59.970 --> 32:03.005
Right, George, arrange
for my passage to Lewiston.

32:03.073 --> 32:04.607
Yes, sir.

32:09.379 --> 32:12.982
Margaret, you can't just come
barging in here when I'm at work.

32:13.050 --> 32:16.818
I just need the answer to one question:
have you decided to join the military?

32:16.886 --> 32:19.654
It's my duty. I can't just sit back

32:19.722 --> 32:23.792
while Her Majesty's empire is
under attack. You understand.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.862
I know enough not to try and
change your mind once it's made up.

32:26.929 --> 32:28.930
Thank you, Margaret.

32:28.998 --> 32:31.866
That's very understanding.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.734
Why aren't they at school?

32:33.802 --> 32:36.436
Thomas, I will not stand in your way,

32:36.504 --> 32:39.706
but it's also your duty as a father
to let them know what you are up to.

32:39.775 --> 32:43.177
Not mine. Boys, your father has something

32:43.245 --> 32:45.445
- he would like to tell you.
- Bloody hell.

32:48.482 --> 32:50.416
What is it, Father?

32:50.484 --> 32:52.518
Come and have a seat, lads.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.027
You've heard there's a war going on?

33:01.095 --> 33:03.728
Our beloved empire is under attack.

33:03.797 --> 33:05.864
Yes, sir.

33:05.932 --> 33:07.966
Well, I have a duty to
serve Queen and country.

33:08.034 --> 33:10.702
You understand that, don't you?

33:10.770 --> 33:12.704
I do, Father,

33:12.772 --> 33:14.472
and if you don't come back,

33:14.540 --> 33:16.474
I will do my duty as well.

33:16.542 --> 33:19.076
I will see that Bobby and
Mother don't go wanting.

33:22.848 --> 33:25.316
You'll be the head of the house, will you?

33:27.619 --> 33:30.621
If need be, Father, I'm prepared.

33:47.205 --> 33:48.771
Mr. Gleason.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.840
Why don't you call me by my real name?

33:50.907 --> 33:52.574
Allen Clegg.

34:08.657 --> 34:12.994
We tried taking the Pendrick Arrow
for its inaugural flight yesterday.

34:13.062 --> 34:14.896
Was it a good flight?

34:17.565 --> 34:19.500
Why won't it turn, Mr. Pendrick?

34:19.568 --> 34:22.502
The test craft did. Why not this one?

34:22.570 --> 34:25.371
You killed Matthews, didn't you?

34:25.438 --> 34:28.007
That's not what we're talking about.

34:28.076 --> 34:30.277
You killed him, didn't you?

34:30.344 --> 34:32.946
Not personally.

34:33.014 --> 34:35.882
Now, Mr. Pendrick,

34:35.949 --> 34:39.650
tell me what I need to know.

34:41.889 --> 34:43.489
I'm not going to hit you.

34:47.527 --> 34:51.230
Remember your last lacrosse game at Yale?

34:51.297 --> 34:54.032
It was the Bulldogs,
wasn't it? The team name?

34:54.100 --> 34:56.101
You should have won that game.

34:56.168 --> 34:59.871
That was the first time your
shoulder popped out, wasn't it?

34:59.939 --> 35:05.076
Then 10 years ago your fondness
for the steeplechase took its toll.

35:05.144 --> 35:08.947
A dislocated shoulder never
quite does heal, does it?

35:09.015 --> 35:13.417
It has a tendency to pop
out when least expected.

35:13.484 --> 35:15.585
And when expected.

35:15.653 --> 35:18.688
(crunch) Ahhhh!

35:21.025 --> 35:24.561
You and I are partners, Mr. Pendrick.

35:24.629 --> 35:26.996
We don't want to take the
Pendrick Arrow from you;

35:27.064 --> 35:29.866
we want to share it with you.

35:32.069 --> 35:37.640
And trust me when I say I make
a better friend than enemy.

35:37.707 --> 35:40.042
(crunch) Ah!

35:44.047 --> 35:46.449
I'll let you catch your breath.

35:51.119 --> 35:52.654
Fire!

35:58.226 --> 36:00.462
- (whispering): Mr. Pendrick.
- Murdoch.

36:00.529 --> 36:03.364
- Are you all right?
- My shoulder is dislocated.

36:03.432 --> 36:04.933
Which one?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.468
The le... the le... the left one.

36:16.177 --> 36:19.079
- Not the plane; it won't fly.
- It will now.

36:19.146 --> 36:20.981
I brought the tilters.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.082
How did you...?

36:23.149 --> 36:24.851
Never mind. Get in.

36:24.918 --> 36:26.819
- Take the controls.
- Me?

36:26.887 --> 36:29.261
- Well, I can't fly; I need two hands.
- But I don't...

36:29.265 --> 36:31.252
Nothing to it but a stout heart. 

36:33.153 --> 36:34.553
All right.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.806
You there!

36:47.874 --> 36:49.908
Stop!

36:55.614 --> 36:58.616
Now gently pull the stick towards you.

36:58.683 --> 37:01.018
More.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.027
It's flying! We're flying!

37:11.094 --> 37:14.797
What did you expect,
man? I'm James Pendrick!

37:14.865 --> 37:18.401
(both laughing)

37:22.706 --> 37:24.741
Damn you, Murdoch.

37:29.712 --> 37:31.580
Why are we going south?

37:31.648 --> 37:34.783
We need to use the
headwinds to gain altitude.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.421
But we're going further into America.

37:39.488 --> 37:42.723
Thank you, but I do
understand basic geography.

37:51.232 --> 37:53.968
Now, let's see if you've
done your job right.

37:54.036 --> 37:56.938
Raise the tilter on
the right wing slightly.

37:59.306 --> 38:01.675
A little more.

38:01.742 --> 38:04.010
That's it.

38:04.078 --> 38:07.847
Now level out the tilters.

38:10.585 --> 38:12.518
(both laughing)

38:12.587 --> 38:16.121
Fine work, Murdoch! Now let's aim for home.

38:24.898 --> 38:26.431
Stop here!

38:31.904 --> 38:34.872
- Brace yourself!
- What?

38:41.914 --> 38:44.949
Suggestions? (gunshot)

38:45.017 --> 38:46.617
Shut up and fly!

38:46.684 --> 38:50.353
Damn it. They're out of range.

39:02.332 --> 39:06.201
Mr. Pendrick, we appear to be descending.

39:06.269 --> 39:09.404
Pull the control stick towards you.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.140
Still descending.

39:11.207 --> 39:13.609
How much do you weigh, Murdoch?

39:13.677 --> 39:16.311
Approximately 160 pounds.

39:16.379 --> 39:19.981
Well, I didn't calculate
for two passengers.

39:20.049 --> 39:23.484
Oh. Right.

39:32.361 --> 39:35.663
Oh. Again, I ask for suggestions.

39:39.300 --> 39:42.870
- What are you doing?
- I'm reducing our net weight.

39:49.310 --> 39:53.980
(engine sputtering) Oh. Perhaps
you've reduced it too much.

39:54.048 --> 39:57.150
The stick! Pull it toward
you as hard as you can!

39:57.217 --> 40:00.019
I am! There's no response!

40:00.087 --> 40:03.389
Lower both tilters!

40:16.535 --> 40:18.904
(Murdoch grunting with effort)

40:22.240 --> 40:24.141
Whoaho!

40:39.556 --> 40:41.390
Take that!

40:41.458 --> 40:44.227
Nobody beats James Pendrick!

40:46.197 --> 40:47.997
Thank you, Mr. Pendrick.

40:48.065 --> 40:50.299
We'll be taking your flying machine now.

40:50.367 --> 40:52.902
- Good work, Detective.
- But... Mr. Pendrick,

40:52.970 --> 40:55.270
I had nothing to do with
this. I swear to you.

40:55.338 --> 40:58.140
Rest assured, Murdoch
was a dupe in all of this.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.810
- I see.
- Get back to the road, get a team of horses and somebody

41:01.878 --> 41:04.546
to dismantle this. I want
it done before sunset.

41:04.614 --> 41:08.150
Make sure that we have
somebody that's qualif...

41:08.218 --> 41:10.251
What in blazes! Murdoch!

41:10.318 --> 41:11.853
Stop him!

41:30.972 --> 41:33.206
It's not yours.

41:33.274 --> 41:35.708
I will not have my name on a war machine.

41:35.777 --> 41:38.111
You'll pay for this, Pendrick.

41:38.179 --> 41:41.347
Mr. Pendrick merely destroyed
his personal property.

41:41.415 --> 41:43.382
There's no crime in that,
as far as I can tell.

41:43.449 --> 41:47.186
You betrayed your country, sir.

41:52.325 --> 41:55.861
You know, someone will
get up there someday.

41:55.929 --> 41:59.397
You're risking losing
your place in history.

41:59.464 --> 42:01.900
Well, if I have a change of heart,

42:01.967 --> 42:04.402
I can always rebuild it,

42:04.469 --> 42:06.737
but only I.

42:06.806 --> 42:09.841
But you're risking not being the first.

42:11.811 --> 42:16.680
We have but one life, Murdoch.
I have to be true to myself.

42:16.747 --> 42:22.853
Besides, we both know
I was first man to fly.

42:22.921 --> 42:25.122
Actually, Mr. Pendrick...

42:25.190 --> 42:27.124
I believe I was.

42:27.192 --> 42:29.026
(Pendrick laughs.)

42:29.093 --> 42:30.626
Touché.

42:32.536 --> 42:34.465
So, we finally got to stik it to Meyers.

42:34.666 --> 42:36.719
That's got to be worth a drinking itself.

42:37.161 --> 42:38.828
Yes.

42:38.896 --> 42:41.564
When do you ship out, sir?

42:41.632 --> 42:43.699
I'm not going anywhere.

42:43.767 --> 42:45.835
Glory is for the young, Murdoch.

42:45.903 --> 42:48.704
I'll leave the thrashing
of the Boers to others.

42:48.772 --> 42:52.574
Well, the military may be
displeased, but I am not.

42:52.642 --> 42:55.911
A man has to be true to the ones he loves.

42:55.979 --> 42:59.415
But it's a bloody pain
in the arse sometimes.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.753
William,

43:04.821 --> 43:07.021
I have to talk to you.

43:07.089 --> 43:09.623
Julia, what is it?

43:09.691 --> 43:13.361
I just met with Darcy. He's
agreed to the annulment.

43:13.429 --> 43:16.831
- We can be married?
- Yes!

43:16.898 --> 43:18.699
We can be married!
