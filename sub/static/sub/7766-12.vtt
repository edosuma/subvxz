WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:15.999
- Uh-oh.
- If there is water...

00:15.999 --> 00:19.999
My top is coming off.

00:19.999 --> 00:23.999
- Max fainted, hit a TV,
and a piece of wood.

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
All of his teeth are f***ed up.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
- We are going to Hawaii
to celebrate

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
mine and Jax's birthday.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
You're trying to act like
I'm a f***ing psycho

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
because I don't want
Kristen to go

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
on my f***ing birthday trip
with me?

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
- I just heard about
the Hawaii trip.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
I just wanted to
know where I stood.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.000
- If I say you can go,
I don't want to eat my words.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
I'm telling Tom and Ariana
forgive and forget with Kristen,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
so it's time to
practice what I preach.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
- Your mom had
actually reached out to me.

00:44.999 --> 00:46.999
She didn't know
if you were unhappy with Tom.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
Your own family has noticed
a change in your personality.

00:48.999 --> 00:49.999
- That really bothers me.

00:49.999 --> 00:52.999
- I love to flirt with Jax
and I don't know how to stop.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
- I just heard
you guys were, like,

00:56.999 --> 00:58.999
whispering in each other's ears
and tickling each other's backs

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
and you have your arm around her
and stuff.

01:00.999 --> 01:01.999
- That's why I was like,
"You need to stop."

01:01.999 --> 01:04.999
- I'm going to have to
talk to her about it.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
- I'm just excited
to go back to Hawaii.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.999
- We're going
to f***ing Hawaii, Tom.

01:08.999 --> 01:09.999
Whoo!

01:09.999 --> 01:12.999
- Happy birthday.

- Yay!

01:56.999 --> 01:59.999
- This is yours, right?

01:59.999 --> 02:00.999
- Yay, I got lei'd.

02:00.999 --> 02:03.999
- Not only are we celebrating
Tom's birthday, Jax's birthday,

02:03.999 --> 02:06.999
we're also kind of celebrating
me and Katie's engagement.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
Katie Maloney,
you're the love of my life,

02:09.999 --> 02:12.999
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
- Of course.

02:13.999 --> 02:14.999
No, yes, of course.

02:17.999 --> 02:18.999
- Schwartz, when was the last
time that you got lei'd?

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
- It's been a while,
not going to lie.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
She's got to knock the dust off
this weekend.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
It's day seven
since the engagement,

02:24.999 --> 02:27.999
and me and Katie
still haven't consummated,

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
but I'm still optimistic.

02:29.999 --> 02:32.000
- Brittany.
- Did you sleep well?

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
Oh, my God.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- I just watched you--

02:36.999 --> 02:39.999
- What'd you do?
- He grabbed her ass, he goes--

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
- I thought it was--
- He thought it was you.

02:40.999 --> 02:42.999
- I'm sorry.

02:42.999 --> 02:43.999
This is probably the most
action that Katie's gotten

02:43.999 --> 02:44.999
since she's been engaged.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
Technically, she should be
thanking me.

02:46.999 --> 02:49.999
- Dude, I just got violated.

02:49.999 --> 02:50.999
Ah!

02:50.999 --> 02:51.999
- Need some help?
- Here we go.

02:51.999 --> 02:52.999
- Here we go.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.999
- Guys, I don't know about you,

02:54.999 --> 02:55.999
but I'm f***ing
so excited right now.

02:55.999 --> 02:57.999
- We're f***ing super excited.

02:57.999 --> 02:58.999
- Hey, shout out
to the birthday boys

02:58.999 --> 02:59.999
for having us
and playing together.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.999
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

03:03.999 --> 03:05.999
- You guys remember last week
when we got engaged?

03:05.999 --> 03:07.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
- More praise! There's not
enough praise coming this way.

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
- Yeah!

03:18.999 --> 03:19.999
- We're here.

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
- Welcome, welcome.

03:20.999 --> 03:23.999
Welcome to The Modern Honolulu.
Hello.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
- Usually, the guys
stay with the guys.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.999
The girls stay together.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.999
- Here are your keys.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- Thank you very much.
- Here we go.

03:30.999 --> 03:33.999
- This trip, it's pretty much
all couples staying together,

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
so I think we're
actually growing up.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- I could use a drink right now.
I could use a steak right now.

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
- Yeah, me too.

03:38.999 --> 03:43.999
- I could use some
you-know-what right now.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
Oh, wow.
- Beautiful.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
- Look at this.

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
Look at the pool.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.000
- We have two balconies.

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
- You go on that one
and I'll go on this one.

03:52.999 --> 03:53.999
Hey.

03:53.999 --> 03:56.999
- It's so cute in here.

03:56.999 --> 03:58.999
Do you love it?
- I've got these.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.999
I like this.
- Can I see?

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
- Oh, wow, this is awesome.

04:02.999 --> 04:04.000
- We can do a lot of
bad things in here.

04:04.999 --> 04:05.999
- I can, like, spy on you.

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
- Ew.
Ew.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.999
- I'm seeing one bed
and I'm seeing two people.

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
- We sleep together
all the time.

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
It's not a big deal.

04:13.999 --> 04:14.999
- I don't want to address
the elephant in the room,

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
but we still haven't had
fiancé sex.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
- I don't like talking about it.

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
- I know, it's got to be
spontaneous.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
- Whoo!

04:22.999 --> 04:23.999
- Nice.

04:23.999 --> 04:26.999
Ah.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
- f***ing Hawaii.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
- This has been
the best birthday week ever.

04:30.999 --> 04:31.999
- I know.

04:31.999 --> 04:34.999
- I mean, I get spoiled
by my friends and my girl.

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
I, of course,
I wish Kristen was here, but--

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
- I know.

04:37.999 --> 04:40.999
- It sucks that Kristen can't
be here all because of egos.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
People can't get over things.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
I just hope that
people that are here,

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
they just don't overstep
their boundaries.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
- No fighting, no fighting.
- No fighting.

04:48.999 --> 04:49.999
- I think the only person
you have

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
that would ever even come close
to would be James,

04:51.999 --> 04:54.999
if he just gets mouthy.

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
- James is so
infatuated with you.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
Can you not tell from today
on the airplane?

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
You guys were, like,
kissing the whole time.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.999
- He loves--PDA is his thing.
- Yeah.

05:02.999 --> 05:05.999
- He asked me to go into
the bathroom on a plane.

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
- No.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.000
- I was like, Mile High Club
is not happening.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.999
He thinks in his mind
he's getting laid on this trip.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
He's not.

05:13.999 --> 05:14.999
I'm worried about
the Brittany thing.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.999
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
It wasn't too long ago
that Jax and I

05:18.999 --> 05:20.999
did some innocent flirting.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
- If I wanted to take you home
and have sex with you,

05:22.999 --> 05:25.000
I would have done it
a long time ago.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.999
I'm worried that Brittany
knows something happened.

05:28.999 --> 05:33.999
This may not be
the smoothest trip.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
- Ah.

05:35.999 --> 05:36.999
- Got my flat iron.

05:36.999 --> 05:38.999
Gets up to 220 degrees Celsius.

05:38.999 --> 05:41.999
Has a kill switch, sleep mode,

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
get up to 190
in less than ten seconds.

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
- Cool story, bro.

05:45.999 --> 05:47.999
So my mom sent me
screenshots of, like,

05:47.999 --> 05:50.999
the whole conversation
that her and Scheana had.

05:56.999 --> 05:59.999
- Dude, are you
f***ing kidding me?

05:59.999 --> 06:02.999
Your mom says, "Hey, in your
opinion is she in a good place?"

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
So Scheana says to your mom,

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
"Honestly, she's different
since being with him."

06:06.999 --> 06:09.999
- Meaning what, exactly,
I'd like to know?

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
- Scheana's trying to sabotage
my relationship with Ariana,

06:12.999 --> 06:17.999
I mean, to send text messages
to her best friend's mom

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
talking about how
sh** of a boyfriend I am,

06:20.999 --> 06:22.999
is really f***ed up.

06:22.999 --> 06:25.999
"Tom will always look out
for himself first."

06:25.999 --> 06:28.999
- If you are worried about me,
talk to me.

06:28.999 --> 06:29.999
Talk to Tom.

06:29.999 --> 06:31.999
Don't talk to my f***ing mom.

06:31.999 --> 06:35.000
- I've done so much
for f***ing Scheana and Shay.

06:35.999 --> 06:36.999
- I know.

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
I would like to address it
with her.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
I want to give Scheana
an opportunity

06:40.999 --> 06:43.999
to tell me where her head
really was at

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
when she said
those horrible things.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
My best friend

06:47.999 --> 06:51.999
sh** all over my boyfriend
to my mom,

06:51.999 --> 06:55.999
and now I get to spend
three days with her in Hawaii

06:55.999 --> 06:58.999
and try to have a good time.

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
- Look how pretty this looks.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.999
- Let the birthday boy
sit at the head.

07:10.999 --> 07:11.999
- Welcome to The Modern.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.999
Can I start some drinks for you?

07:13.999 --> 07:16.999
- I want to do
a coconut piña colada.

07:16.999 --> 07:17.999
- I'm gonna do a vodka soda.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- I'm good, actually, thank you.

07:19.999 --> 07:20.999
- Max.
- What?

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
- How you doing, man?
You good?

07:22.999 --> 07:23.999
- I'm good.
I can't talk that well though.

07:23.999 --> 07:26.999
- All right, I just want--I'm
just making sure you feel okay.

07:26.999 --> 07:27.999
Can you eat?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.999
- Very carefully, yeah.
- Very carefully?

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
- Hey, wait, guys, real quick,
can I have your attention?

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
So, sort of set up
some activities for us to do

07:35.999 --> 07:36.999
over the next couple days.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.999
Tomorrow, we're doing a hike.

07:39.999 --> 07:40.999
I'm going to be your guide.

07:40.999 --> 07:41.999
Oh.

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
- f***.

07:44.999 --> 07:45.999
- Who's in for the hike?

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
- I'm in.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
- I can't.
It's my jaw.

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
- Okay, I'm going to stay behind
with Max, too, though.

07:50.999 --> 07:52.999
- All right.
So, all right, so that's cool.

07:52.999 --> 07:56.999
And then the day after that
we have surf lessons.

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
Everybody good with that?
- Yeah!

07:57.999 --> 07:59.999
- How about we just meet up
after the hike

07:59.999 --> 08:02.999
and we go to the beach?

08:02.999 --> 08:06.999
- It's tough trying to be at
dinner and have a good time

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
because all I can think about

08:08.999 --> 08:11.999
is Scheana sending
these f***ed up text messages.

08:11.999 --> 08:14.999
That's a given.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.999
- Oh, my God.
- Shut up.

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
- Cool!

08:19.000 --> 08:23.999
Oh, my God!

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
- Yeah!

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
- The drinks, the food,
the hula dancers.

08:27.999 --> 08:30.999
Now I feel legitimately like
I'm on vacation.

08:30.999 --> 08:31.999
Life is awesome.

08:31.999 --> 08:35.000
- Get up there, babe.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
Yeah!
Shake that thing.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
Look good, babe.

08:40.999 --> 08:44.999
Yeah.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

08:46.999 --> 08:50.999
Drop that stuff.
- Down low. Down low.

08:54.999 --> 08:55.999
- That's so funny.

08:55.999 --> 08:59.999
- All right, well, we just got
our Hawaiian cherry popped.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
- It is two people's birthday,

09:03.999 --> 09:06.999
and we are on
an awesome vacation

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
with a really awesome
group of people.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.999
It's really cool
that everyone's here,

09:10.999 --> 09:13.999
and so I kind of just wanted
to make a toast

09:13.999 --> 09:17.999
to our two birthday guys here.

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
- Happy birthday, guys.
- Happy birthday, guys.

09:19.999 --> 09:20.999
Cheers.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
- So glad to be here
with all you guys.

09:22.999 --> 09:25.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.999
- Let's eat.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.999
- I'm all about taking
the moral high ground here.

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
I mean, I decided to invite
James to come on the trip,

09:31.999 --> 09:32.999
but I mean, the last thing
I want to do

09:32.999 --> 09:35.999
is watch James and Lala, like,
pawing all over each other.

09:35.999 --> 09:36.999
Like, I didn't
come here for that.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.999
- Cheers.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
- You all right, dude?

09:41.999 --> 09:42.999
- You're quiet.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.999
- Nothing.
Everything's fine.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
Nothing.
There's nothing.

09:48.999 --> 09:49.999
I--I--

09:49.999 --> 09:50.999
- Just say it.

09:50.999 --> 09:53.999
- I do wish that
some other people were here.

09:53.999 --> 09:56.999
I feel like there are
some people that are here

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
that shouldn't be.

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
- Who's not supposed to be here?

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
- I'm not going to get into it.

10:05.999 --> 10:06.999
- What the f***?
Why did you bring it up then?

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
You don't just say stuff like
that and then you're like,

10:08.999 --> 10:09.999
"But I'm not going
to get into it."

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
- Control your lady down there.

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
- Excuse me?
- Careful, man.

10:11.999 --> 10:14.999
- "Control your lady"?
- Shut up, Jax.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
Don't be a dick, man.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- Brittany needs to learn
how to control her man.

10:17.999 --> 10:20.999
And his mouth.
And his actions.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
- He isn't man enough to just
go ahead and say something

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
and he goes and gets
half the sundae

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
but he doesn't want to put
the cherry on top of it.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.999
You don't go and say
"Some people should be here

10:27.999 --> 10:28.999
and some people shouldn't."

10:28.999 --> 10:29.999
What are you trying to say?

10:29.999 --> 10:30.999
Kristen should be here
and I shouldn't?

10:30.999 --> 10:33.999
- Yeah, she should be here, yes.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
James is this young little brat,
you know?

10:35.999 --> 10:37.999
He wants to be the alpha dog.

10:37.999 --> 10:40.999
He has to realize
that I'm the alpha dog.

10:40.999 --> 10:41.999
- Be honest, mate.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
What the f***
is your problem with me?

10:43.999 --> 10:44.999
- There's just some people
in this world

10:44.999 --> 10:45.999
you're not going to like,
regardless.

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
- No, but what is
your issue with me?

10:46.999 --> 10:47.999
Just say one thing.

10:47.999 --> 10:48.999
- 'Cause you're obnoxious.

10:48.999 --> 10:49.999
- Oh, f*** off, so are you,
bruv.

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999
- I'm obnoxious?

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
Are you serious?

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- Can we just have fun, please,
you guys?

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
- All right.

10:56.999 --> 10:57.999
I'm going to go smoke
a f***ing cigarette.

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
This is bollocks.
You want to come?

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
- So now what?

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
- Coming up...

11:08.999 --> 11:09.999
- You guys have this

11:09.999 --> 11:10.999
we're-better-than-everyone
attitude,

11:10.999 --> 11:11.999
- But guess what?

11:11.999 --> 11:13.999
Not everyone texted
f***ing Arianna's mom.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.999
- Get over it.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.999
- Let's go to this bar.

11:24.999 --> 11:25.999
You guys want to go to a bar
or something?

11:25.999 --> 11:26.999
- Are we all going to go
to the bar?

11:26.999 --> 11:30.999
- What the f*** was that about?

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
I was enjoying myself
one second.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.999
The next second it, like,
turns into a bunch of bulls***.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.999
He's very jealous
of the fact that

11:37.999 --> 11:39.999
I've got a lot happening
with me right now.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.999
37 and he's still f***ing
slinging drinks left and right.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
I don't respect the guy.

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
He's like a f***ing fly
in my face.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.999
- Ooh, it's cold in here.

11:49.999 --> 11:51.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

11:51.999 --> 11:54.999
- Why don't you sit down?
- Is this, like, a split party?

11:54.999 --> 11:57.000
- What's up, guys?

11:57.999 --> 11:59.999
- Can this guy just leave me
alone for two f***ing minutes?

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
f***ing obsessive prick.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.999
- Listen, James,
I don't like you.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.999
- I know that, so--
- You don't care for me.

12:06.999 --> 12:07.999
I don't know how
I put this politely.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
Let's just be kosher
when we're in the same room

12:09.999 --> 12:11.999
and let bygones be bygones.

12:11.999 --> 12:12.999
- All right.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
I'm not going to initiate
anything with Jax

12:14.999 --> 12:15.999
because it's just
a waste of my time.

12:15.999 --> 12:18.999
But, you know, if he disrespects
me again, I'll get in his face.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.999
All right, can we
change the subject now?

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
- So you guys are
going on the hike tomorrow.

12:23.999 --> 12:28.999
We're going to do gym and pool
and just have a little us-time.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
- Yeah, I'm just curious.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
Arianna told me
that her mom hit you up.

12:33.999 --> 12:36.999
She was concerned about her
or something.

12:36.999 --> 12:40.999
- It wasn't anything that
she needed to be concerned over.

12:40.999 --> 12:41.999
That's why I never
brought it up.

12:41.999 --> 12:46.999
- I made her send me screenshots
of your entire conversation.

12:46.999 --> 12:50.999
- "He's very good at
convincing her of what he wants.

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
"She just goes along with it.

12:52.999 --> 12:53.999
"I just think her attitude
has changed

12:53.999 --> 12:54.999
since they've been together."

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
- I do think it has, absolutely.
- In what way?

12:56.999 --> 12:59.999
- You're just not the same
as you were a few years ago.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
Arianna, you're so negative.
You're so negative.

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
- Good.
- That's a good thing?

13:03.999 --> 13:04.999
- I don't give a f***.

13:04.999 --> 13:07.999
My point is that you said some
really mean things about Tom

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
that I thought were
really messed up.

13:09.999 --> 13:10.999
- "Always looks out
for himself first."

13:10.999 --> 13:11.999
- You do.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
- Are you kidding me?

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
Like, what kind of friend
have I been to you in the past,

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
like, couple years?

13:16.999 --> 13:19.000
- And I have never been here
for you? Never.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.999
You didn't come
and move in with us

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
when you and Kristen broke up.

13:22.999 --> 13:23.999
- It's awfully loud over there.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.999
- Ariana's mom saw
a text or something?

13:26.999 --> 13:28.999
- Wait, wait, wait, Jax.
You guys.

13:28.999 --> 13:30.999
Can we eavesdrop for a sec?

13:30.999 --> 13:33.000
- "Yeah, it's his attitude,
and he's better than everything,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.999
and I think it's rubbing off
on her the wrong way."

13:34.999 --> 13:35.999
- You guys do.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
I stand by everything I said.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.999
I wasn't trying to
break up Tom and Ariana.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
I was just being a good friend
by being honest.

13:42.999 --> 13:45.999
If my best friend's mother
is concerned,

13:45.999 --> 13:46.999
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

13:46.999 --> 13:47.999
His cocky attitude rubs off,

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
and you guys have this

13:49.999 --> 13:50.999
we're-better-than-everyone
attitude.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
- I do not have that.
- You do.

13:52.999 --> 13:53.999
- It does come off
that way sometimes.

13:53.999 --> 13:54.999
- Everyone thinks so.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
- Yeah, but guess what?

13:56.999 --> 13:58.999
Not everyone texted
f***ing Ariana's mom.

13:58.999 --> 13:59.999
- She texted me first.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.000
- And the fact
that you're that oblivious

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
as to how f***ed up that is?

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
- Get over it.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
- I can't figure out
what her motivation is.

14:07.999 --> 14:11.999
She can't admit
that what she did was wrong,

14:11.999 --> 14:14.999
and I've never seen Scheana
do something as wrong as this.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
What is the attitude?

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
Like, why are you so sassy
and rude to her?

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
- Because you both are trying
to, like, put words in my mouth.

14:21.999 --> 14:22.999
- I just read your words.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.999
- We just read
your text messages.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
- Yes, that you're cocky.
I'm sorry.

14:27.999 --> 14:31.999
Does the truth hurt?

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
- You've never had somebody
do this to you.

14:33.999 --> 14:34.999
You've never had somebody text.

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
- I'm sorry.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
- I've been here for you guys
so much.

14:37.999 --> 14:39.999
I have f***ing moved mountains.

14:39.999 --> 14:42.999
Can you guys say
the same f***ing thing?

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
- That was my feelings.
I'm going to stand by them.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
The conversation's done,

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
so I'm either going to go to bed
or go anywhere other than here,

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
so I will see you guys tomorrow.

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
Again, I'm sorry.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
Clearly, I hurt Tom.

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
However,
I still think he's cocky

14:56.999 --> 14:57.999
and I'm not going
to take that back.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
Sorry, not sorry.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.999
- Oh, we got a storm-off.
We got a storm-off.

15:02.999 --> 15:03.999
- Oh, no.

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
- I wanted to talk to her.

15:05.999 --> 15:06.999
- Oh, but Ariana
is seriously like--

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
- Seriously what, Shay?

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
- I don't care about--
- What were you talking about?

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
- How am I supposed to
take these text messages?

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
f***ing read them.

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
You would f***ing flip the f***
out if you were in my shoes,

15:15.999 --> 15:17.999
if somebody did that to you.

15:17.999 --> 15:18.999
- I would never do that to you.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
- I'm telling you, dude.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.000
What is behind it?

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
- Obviously you can't--
oh, my God, dude,

15:23.999 --> 15:24.999
this is f***ing stupid.

15:38.999 --> 15:39.999
- Ken?

15:39.999 --> 15:40.999
Just had a shower.

15:40.999 --> 15:44.999
Perfect.

15:44.999 --> 15:45.999
You just sit there.
You're not going to have any.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
No, you can sit there.

15:47.999 --> 15:48.999
No.

15:48.999 --> 15:50.999
I wouldn't go to Hawaii
if I'd broken a nail,

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
let alone broken a tooth,
let's be honest.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
- He's 23 years of age.

15:54.999 --> 15:55.999
- Yeah, still a baby.

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
Should I call him?

15:57.999 --> 15:58.999
- No, he'll feel like
he's being mothered

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
in front of all those people.

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
"It's your mother again.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
She wants to know if you've
taken your antibiotics."

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
- Oh, shut up.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.999
How can he say
I'm mothering him too much?

16:06.999 --> 16:10.999
Ken is the most doting father

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
on the planet.

16:12.999 --> 16:13.999
If you've seen Ken with Giggy,

16:13.999 --> 16:15.999
you pretty much get the picture.

16:15.999 --> 16:17.999
So he's not taking
his antibiotics?

16:17.999 --> 16:18.999
- Is James there?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.999
- James isn't any more
responsible than Max, really,

16:21.999 --> 16:22.999
is he?

16:22.999 --> 16:24.000
- You shouldn't be
spitting on girls--

16:24.000 --> 16:25.999
- I did not spit
on any f***ing girls,

16:25.999 --> 16:26.999
so don't f***ing tell me
that I am.

16:26.999 --> 16:27.999
- Okay, stop it right now.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.000
Stop it right now.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.999
James is a little erratic
and unpredictable,

16:31.999 --> 16:34.999
and I just don't want him
to influence Max.

16:35.999 --> 16:38.999
If only Max was as easy as you,
Giggy.

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
- Should I wear these?

16:54.999 --> 16:55.999
- Oh, God.

16:55.999 --> 16:56.999
- Or should I wear these?

16:56.999 --> 16:59.999
- You should burn both of them.

16:59.999 --> 17:00.999
- Awake.

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
Hawaii's heaven.
Love it. Love it.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
Feel that f***ing sunshine
on my face,

17:04.999 --> 17:05.999
have some good drinks.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
I'm going HAM.

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
I'm going hard
as a motherf***er.

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
I mean, dude,
it's kind of going to suck

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
if we don't get laid in Hawaii.

17:11.999 --> 17:13.999
- My f***ing teeth hurt.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.000
- So tired.
I fell asleep so fast.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
The time difference kills me.

17:27.999 --> 17:28.999
I got to tell you something.

17:28.999 --> 17:29.999
- What?

17:29.999 --> 17:30.999
- When you were sleeping, I, uh,

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
sort of set up
a little tripod out there

17:32.999 --> 17:35.999
and took a naked picture
of myself on the balcony.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
- Why would you take
a naked picture of yourself--

17:37.999 --> 17:39.999
- I was trying to recreate
the Bieber picture.

17:39.999 --> 17:40.999
- What Bieber picture?

17:40.999 --> 17:43.999
- The one where he was
standing naked and pointing.

17:43.999 --> 17:48.999
- Okay, I'm not obviously an
avid follower of Justin Bieber.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
Oh, my God.

17:50.999 --> 17:53.000
- I had to put some filters
'cause I was a little insecure.

17:54.999 --> 17:57.999
- I own that ass, bitches.
I own that ass.

18:01.999 --> 18:02.999
- Hey.
- Hi, good morning.

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
Where should I place this
for you?

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
- Dude, whoa.
Those are nice.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
- They have my name on them.
Thank you.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
- You guys have a good day.

18:09.999 --> 18:10.999
- "Congrats, sweetie.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
"Have a wonderful,
romantic time.

18:12.999 --> 18:13.999
"Don't give him too much.

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
"Save something
for the honeymoon.

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
Love, Lisa and Ken."

18:17.999 --> 18:18.999
Oh, my God.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
- Yeah, that's why
we haven't been having sex,

18:20.999 --> 18:23.999
because we're saving up
for the honeymoon.

18:23.999 --> 18:26.999
Soon we're going to have
a wealth of sexual energy

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
to just splurge on each other.

18:28.999 --> 18:31.999
Wait, that doesn't sound right.

18:31.999 --> 18:34.999
- Oh, my God.
Do we, like, call her?

18:34.999 --> 18:35.999
- Yeah, we probably should.

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
- Hello?

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
- Hi, Lisa, it's Katie and Tom.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
- Hello, darling. How are you?

18:47.999 --> 18:48.999
- Oh, we're fantastic.

18:48.999 --> 18:52.999
We just got the most gorgeous
bouquet of flowers.

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
- They're fabulous.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.999
- I've had a long time
to save up for them.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
- Well, thank you so much.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
- So, tell me honestly,
how's Max doing?

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
- He looks great
and he's in good spirits

19:03.999 --> 19:04.999
and he's having a great time.

19:04.999 --> 19:05.999
- I'm worried
about him drinking.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
I'm worried
about him doing things

19:07.999 --> 19:08.999
that he shouldn't be doing.

19:08.999 --> 19:11.999
I'm worried about him
even kissing somebody

19:11.999 --> 19:14.999
with all those teeth that are
almost falling out of his head.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.999
Katie, will you
keep an eye on him?

19:16.999 --> 19:17.999
- Of course.

19:17.999 --> 19:20.999
Lisa as a mother is as tough
as she is as a boss,

19:20.999 --> 19:23.999
so Max can't get away
with anything.

19:23.999 --> 19:24.999
- Behave yourself, all of you.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
Remember,
when you're all together,

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
it makes me nervous.

19:27.999 --> 19:30.999
Make sure that you, you know,
don't get into any trouble.

19:30.999 --> 19:31.999
Not Max.
- Of course.

19:31.999 --> 19:34.999
All right, well, thank you.
We'll see you when we get back.

19:34.999 --> 19:35.999
- Bye, Lisa.
- Thank you, bye-bye.

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
- I'm quite impressed, dude.

19:37.999 --> 19:39.999
I usually have to work out
by myself on these vacations.

19:39.999 --> 19:40.999
I didn't think you guys
would get up.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.999
- It is too early.

19:42.999 --> 19:44.999
After that conversation
I had last night,

19:44.999 --> 19:45.999
I could barely sleep.

19:45.999 --> 19:46.999
- I didn't even hear about that.

19:46.999 --> 19:47.999
- Sandoval and I
kind of got into it.

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
He's been kind of
pissing me off lately.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.000
- Is everything okay now, or no?

19:51.999 --> 19:52.999
- No.
I haven't talked to him.

19:52.999 --> 19:55.999
I'm just really glad I'm not
going to go on a three hour hike

19:55.999 --> 19:56.999
with him today.

19:56.999 --> 19:59.999
- On top of it all, I'm in
frickin' Hawaii with Lala?

19:59.999 --> 20:02.999
- Oh, sh**.
Yeah, that's awkward.

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
- I just don't like
hearing about the flirting

20:04.999 --> 20:06.999
and trying to kiss you
on your neck and all that.

20:06.999 --> 20:08.999
- I never crossed the line
and I never took it too far.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.999
I just didn't know
how to handle it.

20:10.999 --> 20:11.999
- I just felt like
she has no respect for herself

20:11.999 --> 20:13.999
or for other women,

20:13.999 --> 20:15.999
and people like that
just disgust me.

20:15.999 --> 20:18.999
- So are you going to
talk to her about that?

20:18.999 --> 20:19.999
- Yeah.
Of course.

20:19.999 --> 20:22.999
- When Brittany wasn't in L.A.,
it was okay to flirt.

20:22.999 --> 20:23.999
I have a clean conscience.

20:23.999 --> 20:26.999
I just hope that Lala's not
going to throw me under the bus.

20:26.999 --> 20:27.999
- Well, I think I need
to talk to her alone at first

20:27.999 --> 20:29.999
just to see what
she has to say about it.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.999
- Coming up...

20:36.999 --> 20:39.999
- I got to take a moment
to say I did see your boobs.

20:53.999 --> 20:54.999
- All right, guys, let's go.

20:54.999 --> 20:55.999
- Ow!

20:55.999 --> 20:56.999
- When I researched Hawaii,

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
I found out hiking
is a really big thing.

20:58.999 --> 21:01.999
Guys, this is the newest version
of Google Maps, so--

21:01.999 --> 21:04.999
I need to get these guys
out of the bar and into nature.

21:04.999 --> 21:05.999
- Why do you need a knife, man?

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
- That's Tom, you know.
He's all about accessories.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.999
It's like he went and raided
Indiana Jones's closet.

21:12.999 --> 21:15.999
- This would be a good picture.

21:15.999 --> 21:18.999
- I want to get higher up.

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999
- Guys, we're here.

21:19.999 --> 21:23.999
- Whoa!

21:23.999 --> 21:24.999
- Yeah!

21:29.999 --> 21:33.999
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

21:33.999 --> 21:35.999
- Uh-oh.

21:35.999 --> 21:39.999
- Ow!

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
- Three guys, three Speedos.

21:41.999 --> 21:42.999
You are welcome.

21:42.999 --> 21:46.999
- Yeah, man.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
- Once upon a time, when we
would take trips like this,

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999
it was for Stassi's birthday.

21:50.999 --> 21:53.999
- Why are you here
for my f***ing birthday?

21:53.999 --> 21:55.999
Jax, is this your birthday
or is it my birthday?

21:55.999 --> 21:56.999
You're coming to
my birthday dinner,

21:56.999 --> 21:58.999
and this is how you treated me.

21:58.999 --> 22:00.000
- One thing you're
definitely not going to hear

22:00.000 --> 22:02.999
come out of my mouth is,
"This is my birthday."

22:02.999 --> 22:05.000
- This is my f***ing birthday.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.999
- "Everybody shut the f*** up."

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
- Everyone shut the f*** up.

22:08.999 --> 22:11.999
- I don't need any special
treatment for my birthday.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
All right.
Say bye, guys.

22:16.999 --> 22:19.999
Whoo!

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
Yeah.

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
Faith and Lala
take their top off

22:32.999 --> 22:34.999
and then huddle
around each other.

22:34.999 --> 22:38.999
It's weird.

22:38.999 --> 22:39.999
- Let the titties out, man.

22:39.999 --> 22:40.999
That's my motto in life.

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
It's always been that way.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.999
It's going to be that way
when I'm 80.

22:43.999 --> 22:47.999
It's just the way it is.

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
- I'm gonna look.

22:49.999 --> 22:50.999
That's just who I am.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

22:52.999 --> 22:56.999
Now the trick is to look
without Brittany seeing me.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.999
- Oh, I just love you.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.999
- Boobs.

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
We love 'em,
but we've seen so many of 'em,

23:02.999 --> 23:05.999
so we're not, like,
losing our sh** over here.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
- I brought some good stuff.

23:18.999 --> 23:19.999
I told Katie to come down
and meet us.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
I hope you don't mind.

23:21.999 --> 23:22.999
I'm not on my period anymore,

23:22.999 --> 23:23.999
but I brought these
just in case.

23:23.999 --> 23:27.999
Oh, sh**.
Pick it up.

23:27.999 --> 23:28.999
If any of us
are going to be drinking,

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
we all have to be
extremely discreet

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
so we don't get
kicked off the beach.

23:31.999 --> 23:32.999
Now you have to take that one.

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
- What the f***?
- Sand and all.

23:34.999 --> 23:35.999
Toss it back.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.999
I really just hope on this trip,
Shay can master moderation.

23:38.999 --> 23:39.999
- Oh, my God.

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
- You can still do shots.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
Just maybe do every other shot.

23:43.999 --> 23:44.999
Maybe don't do three beer bongs.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.999
Maybe do one.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
- Hello.
- Hey, sister wife.

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
- What are you guys doing?
- Oh, hey.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
- Can I join the party?
- Yeah.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
- Since I'm already,
like, the third wheel.

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
Oh, Shay,
you brought your tampon.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
I didn't know
you were on your period.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
- Cheers to not hiking today.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999
- Yes.
- Yeah.

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
I might get burned,
but at least I'll be drunk,

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
because there's
no suntan lotion in this bottle.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
It's all tequila.

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
- They're all sweating
their asses off right now.

24:07.999 --> 24:10.999
- What if Sandoval got lost?

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
- This is not the right way.
I see poison ivy.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.999
- Hold on, guys.
Hold on.

24:14.999 --> 24:15.999
- Where do we go in at?

24:15.999 --> 24:16.999
- The guide doesn't know
where to go.

24:16.999 --> 24:17.999
- Relax.

24:17.999 --> 24:21.999
There it is, right there.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
- I got to take a moment
to say I did see your boobs.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
I wasn't looking at 'em,
but I saw 'em.

24:25.999 --> 24:26.999
- That's okay.

24:26.999 --> 24:27.999
- I was looking
at this direction

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
and you came into
my plane of view.

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
- Yeah.

24:30.999 --> 24:31.999
- Lala, I'm going
to ask you probably

24:31.999 --> 24:34.999
the most awkward,
weird question ever.

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
- Do it.
Do it.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.000
- Are your boobs real or not?

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
- No, they're fake.

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
- There's no reason to be
scandalized by Lala's boobs.

24:41.999 --> 24:45.999
I mean, it's not like
they're real boobs.

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
Good job.
They look legit.

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
- Can I touch your knife, Tom?

24:48.999 --> 24:49.999
- Yeah.

24:49.999 --> 24:50.999
- I don't want to kill the vibe,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.999
but what was going on
with you and Scheana?

24:53.999 --> 24:56.999
- She basically
took it upon herself

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
to text my mom
all kinds of, like,

24:58.999 --> 25:01.999
sh** talking about Tom,
saying he's all about himself,

25:01.999 --> 25:02.999
puts himself first.

25:02.999 --> 25:04.999
- What?

25:04.999 --> 25:05.999
- Ariana's mom texted me
and said,

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
"In your opinion,
is she in a good place?"

25:07.999 --> 25:10.999
I said, "Honestly, I think it's
all about Tom all the time.

25:10.999 --> 25:12.999
"He has this attitude that
he's better than everything.

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
I think it's rubbing off
the wrong way."

25:14.999 --> 25:15.999
- Okay, well-
- Which is--that--yeah.

25:15.999 --> 25:17.999
It's not that bad.
Yeah, exactly.

25:17.999 --> 25:18.999
- It's the truth.
- That--

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
- I'm sorry, the truth hurts.

25:20.999 --> 25:22.999
- But he can be a little,
like, overly confident.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
- She said, like,
"You are kind of like that.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.999
"You are like, blah blah blah.

25:26.999 --> 25:29.999
"Like, we do--everybody
thinks that about you, Tom.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
Like, you do act like
you're out for yourself."

25:31.999 --> 25:33.999
- Dude, you're not
out for yourself.

25:33.999 --> 25:34.999
- Dude, I know, man.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
- You're one of the most
generous friends I've ever had.

25:36.999 --> 25:38.999
- Aww.
- Thanks, man.

25:38.999 --> 25:39.999
- Especially in the bedroom.

25:39.999 --> 25:40.999
- Aw.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
- I think one of the beefs
they've had with you

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
is, like, they felt like
you've been kind of, like,

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
extra cynical
and reclusive lately.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
You've been very snappy
in the past, like, few months.

25:48.999 --> 25:51.999
- Oh.
Well, welcome to who I am.

25:51.999 --> 25:52.999
If I don't like something,

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
I feel 100% comfortable
in voicing that.

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
- That's scary sometimes.

25:55.999 --> 25:57.999
It's scary sometimes.

25:57.999 --> 26:00.999
- Well, sorry.
Sorry.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
People who--like,
both of us kind of thought

26:02.999 --> 26:05.999
were our best friends
are just becoming more distant

26:05.999 --> 26:06.999
or not friends anymore,

26:06.999 --> 26:07.999
and it's like,
I just don't feel like

26:07.999 --> 26:09.999
she's my best friend anymore.

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
Like, you totally are,

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
and like, I mean,
who would have f***ing thought,

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
like, we would be in this place?

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
- Keep your nose
out of other people's business.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
- My nose is fine right here.
Thank you.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
- Are you trying to be my
friend? It's f***ing bullsh**.

26:21.999 --> 26:22.999
- I'm not trying to be
your friend.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
- Scheana, shut the f*** up.
Honestly.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
- I don't f***ing care
because it's my birthday,

26:26.999 --> 26:27.999
and f*** you guys.

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
We've just gotten so close
and it's like,

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
I feel like we're both
such good friends

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
and we have each other's back
and we call each other out

26:33.999 --> 26:36.999
and that's, like,
what a true friendship is.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
I talk to Katie 24/7,

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
and we're both in relationships

26:39.999 --> 26:42.999
but we still have
that time for each other.

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
Tom and Ariana put themselves
on this pedestal.

26:44.999 --> 26:47.999
It's just them and then us.

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
I used to have that with her
and I don't have it anymore,

26:49.000 --> 26:50.999
and, it does,

26:50.999 --> 26:51.999
it makes me really f***ing sad,
but I'm like,

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
I can't beg for a friendship

26:53.999 --> 26:57.999
that's just not
where it used to be.

26:57.999 --> 26:58.999
- You guys want to head
back to the hotel?

26:58.999 --> 26:59.999
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.999
- All right, guys.
- Come on.

27:01.999 --> 27:02.999
- Has everybody got everything?

27:02.999 --> 27:03.999
- Can I talk to you
for a second, girl?

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
- Yeah.

27:05.999 --> 27:09.999
- Obviously, you know
that I've heard about

27:09.999 --> 27:12.999
you coming up behind Jax
and, like, kissing on his neck,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
and there's been
numerous occasions

27:14.999 --> 27:16.999
where you're like,
overly flirty and--

27:16.999 --> 27:17.999
- Yeah.

27:17.999 --> 27:20.999
- You've just had no respect
for my relationship,

27:20.999 --> 27:22.999
so what the f*** is going on?

27:22.999 --> 27:24.999
- So it--I'm going to
defend myself real quick.

27:24.999 --> 27:25.999
- Okay.

27:25.999 --> 27:27.999
- And I think you can
vouch for this as well.

27:27.999 --> 27:30.999
Have I crossed lines before?
Absolutely.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
We have flirted before.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
I apologize.

27:33.999 --> 27:34.999
On my life, I promise.

27:34.999 --> 27:36.999
- I'll give it to her,
she has been drunk.

27:36.999 --> 27:39.999
I don't honestly think it's
going to say that's okay.

27:39.999 --> 27:40.999
- As far as I was concerned,

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
he told me that you guys
weren't together.

27:42.999 --> 27:44.999
- You knew that we
were all together.

27:44.999 --> 27:45.999
How would you not know?

27:45.999 --> 27:47.000
- I didn't know,
and I'm being honest.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.999
You did tell me, like,
"We're not together.

27:49.999 --> 27:50.999
She's not moving here."

27:50.999 --> 27:51.999
- Would I call her
"girlfriend" yet?

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
No.

27:52.999 --> 27:53.999
I don't know what's going on.

27:53.999 --> 27:54.999
I don't think it's
anything anymore.

27:54.999 --> 27:56.999
Brittany's not coming.

27:56.999 --> 27:59.999
- We've been together
the whole time.

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
- I've never not said that
you and I are not dating.

28:01.999 --> 28:04.999
I would never not say that.

28:04.999 --> 28:07.999
- At first, I thought Jax
was just leaving out details.

28:07.999 --> 28:11.999
Now I know that Jax
is just a f***ing liar.

28:11.999 --> 28:12.999
- Coming up...

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
- Tom's not cocky.

28:14.999 --> 28:15.999
- That's a Tom Schwartz
interpretation.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
- Don't say it's a Tom Schwartz
interpretation.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
- I feel like, stop trying to
put me in my place about sh**.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
- Katie.
Don't do that.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
I would never not say that.

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
- Obviously you guys
are together.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
I respect relationships.
- Yeah.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
- And this is your man.

28:37.999 --> 28:40.999
Trust me, I mean,
I would be pissed off too.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
In fact, I'm--I admire the fact
that you're like,

28:42.999 --> 28:45.999
"Can I talk to you real quick,"
'cause I would have hit a bitch.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
I could tell Brittany
a lot of things

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
that she doesn't want to hear,

28:49.999 --> 28:51.999
but right now, I don't see
the point in doing that.

28:51.999 --> 28:53.999
- Listen, it is what it is.
Just squash it.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.999
It's over.
Everyone's friends again.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
One of the main things
I love about Brittany

28:57.999 --> 29:01.999
is she doesn't hold grudges
and she's not about the drama,

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
but I feel like
I dodged a bullet with that one.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.999
- ♪ You're so bad ♪

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
♪ He wants you bad ♪

29:13.999 --> 29:18.999
♪ Oooh ♪

29:18.999 --> 29:19.999
♪ Love overdose ♪

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
- Cheers, bruv.
Hawaii living.

29:21.999 --> 29:22.999
- Cheers, mate.
- Yeah, mate.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
Ooh, yeah, mate.

29:24.999 --> 29:25.999
Hey, Max.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
- Yeah.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
- Are you really meant to be
drinking alcohol right now, Max?

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
- Uh, not really, no.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
- At first, I wasn't going
to allow Max to drink,

29:33.999 --> 29:36.999
but then I realized alcohol
disinfects his mouth,

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
so that's helping.

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
What's the situation
with Faith and Lala right now?

29:40.999 --> 29:41.999
- I'm not sure.

29:41.999 --> 29:44.999
- Lala is so f***ing hot, man.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
She drives me crazy.

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
She looks, like,
classy and, like, sexy.

29:48.999 --> 29:49.999
- Just have fun with it, man.

29:49.999 --> 29:50.999
It's all good.
- I will, I will.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.999
Why do I like
the bad girls, bruv?

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
Faith, on the other hand,
has got, like,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.999
her complete devoted attention
to you.

29:57.999 --> 30:00.999
The goal is to get them
both in bed tonight, bruv.

30:00.999 --> 30:01.999
- Yeah.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.999
- It's happening.
It's going down.

30:03.999 --> 30:06.999
Max is pulling one for the team
even if he doesn't want to.

30:10.999 --> 30:12.000
- Hey, Mom.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.999
- Hi, darling.
Is everything okay?

30:13.999 --> 30:16.999
- Everything's great.

30:16.999 --> 30:20.999
- Yeah, of course I'm behaving.

30:20.999 --> 30:23.999
- I'll be okay.
Don't worry.

30:23.999 --> 30:26.999
- Hi, how are you, Lisa?

30:28.999 --> 30:31.999
- No, not at all, actually.

30:31.999 --> 30:32.999
- Bye, Mom, I love you.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.999
- Thank you, Lisa.

30:35.999 --> 30:36.999
- Bye.
- Nice to see you.

30:36.999 --> 30:38.999
I love your mom, dude.

30:38.999 --> 30:39.999
She loves you so much.

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
She just cares about you
so much.

30:41.999 --> 30:42.999
She's the best.

30:42.999 --> 30:43.999
- I know.
- Hi, loves.

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
- Hey.
You all right?

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

30:46.999 --> 30:49.999
- Can I sit next to you, bruv?

30:49.999 --> 30:52.999
- Tell me how exciting going
through the jungle with Jax was.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.999
- I got pulled aside
by Brittany.

30:56.999 --> 30:57.999
- Oh, yeah?

30:57.999 --> 31:00.999
- To talk about some sh**
with Jax or whatever.

31:00.999 --> 31:02.999
I took ownership for my part,

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
but she needs to know
that he played a part

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
in whatever happened as well.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
So that needs to happen tonight.

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
Like, today I let it slide.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
Tonight is a different story.

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
- What's going on, bubba?

31:19.999 --> 31:20.999
Hi.
- Hi.

31:20.999 --> 31:21.999
- What are you doing?

31:21.999 --> 31:23.999
- I was just at the beach.

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
- What?
- You know.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
I was with Scheana and Shay,
you know.

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
- How's that third wheel action?

31:28.999 --> 31:29.999
- It was great.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
- The waterfall, like,

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
it wasn't nearly as romantic as
we thought it was going to be.

31:32.999 --> 31:33.999
- Was it a big waterfall?

31:33.999 --> 31:34.999
- No, it was like--
- What?

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
- It was like
a pretty small pool.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
Like, I swear the pool was like,
as big as two of these rooms.

31:38.999 --> 31:43.999
Everyone was cool, but I did see
Lala's and Faith's boobs.

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
But I didn't look at them.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
I just happened
to be looking around

31:47.999 --> 31:51.999
and then all of a sudden
they were topless today.

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
I'm trying to nip this
in the bud,

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
and all Katie's hearing
is "nipple."

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
I didn't look at them.

31:56.999 --> 31:57.999
It's like this.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
If you're just turning around,
oh, there's boobs there.

31:59.999 --> 32:00.999
I kept turning.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
I didn't, like,
stop and ogle them.

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
- Why would they go topless?

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
- I don't know.

32:04.999 --> 32:05.999
We were all wondering that
ourselves.

32:05.999 --> 32:06.999
- But this is why Lala and I
will never be friends,

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
because she leads
with her sexuality.

32:08.999 --> 32:10.999
It makes me feel,
like, a little icky.

32:10.999 --> 32:12.999
- She's a sexual being.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
- Lala just takes her top off?

32:14.999 --> 32:17.999
Have some respect for someone
that's newly engaged.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
Why the f*** were her boobs out?

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
- I just heard kind of about
what happened with Scheana

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
in the text, though, that
Scheana sent to Ariana's mom.

32:24.999 --> 32:25.999
They were way out of line.

32:25.999 --> 32:26.999
- I don't think so.

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999
- Yes, they were.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
- You think it's out of line?
Like--

32:29.999 --> 32:30.999
- I thought they were
a little out of line.

32:30.999 --> 32:31.999
- How?
Why is that out of line?

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
- 'Cause, 'cause they weren't
just constructive.

32:33.999 --> 32:36.999
They were crossing lines saying
that Tom's only out for himself.

32:36.999 --> 32:37.999
Come on.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- That's a Tom Schwartz
interpretation of things--

32:39.999 --> 32:42.999
- No, no, no, Tom Schwartz
is reasonable and diplomatic.

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
Don't say it's
a Tom Schwartz interpretation.

32:44.999 --> 32:45.999
- I feel like
sometimes he'll be--

32:45.999 --> 32:46.999
- It's a Katie Maloney
interpretation.

32:46.999 --> 32:47.999
- She said,
"I feel like sometimes

32:47.999 --> 32:48.999
he can only be out for himself."

32:48.999 --> 32:50.000
That's what she said.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.999
- Tom's not cocky.
He's not.

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
- He can be cocky sometimes.

32:52.999 --> 32:54.000
- He's not cocky.

32:54.999 --> 32:55.999
- Are we really going to
drag this out over one thing

32:55.999 --> 32:56.999
that she said about him
being cocky?

32:56.999 --> 32:57.999
Who cares?
- I'm not dragging it out.

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
We're just talking, me and you.

32:59.999 --> 33:00.999
- So stop trying to put me
in my place about sh**.

33:00.999 --> 33:01.999
- Shhhh.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
Katie.
Don't do that.

33:03.999 --> 33:04.999
You're not presenting
the whole story.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.999
I'm just trying to see
both sides.

33:06.999 --> 33:07.999
- I see both sides.
You don't support me.

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
- I don't support you?
Come on.

33:09.999 --> 33:12.999
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I support you.

33:12.999 --> 33:14.999
- I know, but you're not--
- Watch this.

33:14.999 --> 33:15.999
- Okay, I have to get ready.

33:15.999 --> 33:16.999
- What?
- I do.

33:16.999 --> 33:17.999
I want to take a shower.

33:17.999 --> 33:19.000
Got to get ready
for the tiki bar.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
- Can I come?
- No.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.999
- I can serenade you,
then have sex with you.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.999
- That, like, ruins it.

33:25.999 --> 33:27.999
- It's day two
of our trip to Hawaii

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
and still haven't had sex.

33:29.999 --> 33:32.999
I thought flying to Hawaii,
we were getting closer to it,

33:32.999 --> 33:36.999
but now, uh, it feels like
it's just slowly slipping away.

33:36.999 --> 33:39.999
- Geez, get the f***
out of here.

33:39.999 --> 33:40.999
- Coming up...

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
- That night where we were
at Lock and Key--

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
- Mm-hmm.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
- He was telling me
he was going to f*** me.

34:02.999 --> 34:03.999
- I love places like this.

34:03.999 --> 34:08.999
- I feel like
I'm in Cabo, right?

34:08.999 --> 34:09.999
- Whoa.

34:09.999 --> 34:11.999
- Wow.

34:11.999 --> 34:12.999
- Guys, cheers, everyone.

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
Pleasure having you guys
all here.

34:17.999 --> 34:21.999
- Happy birthday, dude.
- Happy birthday.

34:21.999 --> 34:22.999
- We had a great day.

34:22.999 --> 34:23.999
- We saw boobs.

34:23.999 --> 34:27.999
- Yeah, I'm not happy
about that.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
- I was like,
"I got something in my eye."

34:29.999 --> 34:32.999
Every guy is a master at looking
at women without getting caught.

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
That's why they
invented sunglasses.

34:34.999 --> 34:38.999
- I heard a little bit
about the waterfall.

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
You guys were,
like, going topless.

34:40.999 --> 34:42.999
- Are you upset about it?

34:42.999 --> 34:46.999
- I just am curious why
that was, like, appropriate.

34:46.999 --> 34:49.999
- I encourage every woman
to go topless.

34:49.999 --> 34:52.999
I just don't like
wearing clothes.

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
They should be thankful
I keep my bottoms on.

34:54.999 --> 34:57.999
- I just think, like, in
the company of, like, my fiancé,

34:57.999 --> 35:00.999
I just found it
to be inappropriate.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
- I completely understand
why Katie's upset.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.999
You don't do something like that

35:04.999 --> 35:06.999
in front of other
girls' boyfriends.

35:06.999 --> 35:07.999
But at the same time,

35:07.999 --> 35:09.999
this is the girl
who does God knows what

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
to get herself onto a yacht
in Italy,

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
so why are you surprised
she went topless in Hawaii?

35:13.999 --> 35:18.999
- It's not like I'm shoving
my nipple in someone's mouth.

35:18.999 --> 35:21.999
Your man is interested in you.
You're interested in him.

35:21.999 --> 35:22.999
What's the problem?

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
- You feel like I always have
an issue with you.

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
Well, it's not going to
get much better

35:25.999 --> 35:28.999
if you're taking your top off
in front of my fiancé.

35:28.999 --> 35:29.999
- Ariana, can I ask you,

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
did you have a problem with me
taking my top off today?

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
- No, you guys were under the
water and you were, like--

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
- Thank you.

35:35.999 --> 35:37.000
- I mean, the f***ing guys
were in Speedos,

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
for God's sakes.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.000
- I know.
How the f*** is that okay?

35:40.999 --> 35:43.999
It's not like I'm showing
my pussy to everybody.

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
- Um, what?

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
- I f***ing can't win.

35:46.999 --> 35:50.999
What she's really trying to say
is "I don't trust my man."

35:50.999 --> 35:51.999
I can suggest something.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.999
Have sex with him sometimes, and
not just laying on your back.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.999
Do something fun.

35:57.999 --> 35:58.999
Hey, does everybody
have a drink?

35:58.999 --> 35:59.999
Are we good?

35:59.999 --> 36:01.999
- Yeah.
- Drink.

36:01.999 --> 36:04.000
Cheers to Free the Nipples.

36:04.999 --> 36:05.999
- Hey, let's just cheers
to f***ing having fun, man.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
- Yeah.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
- Can I cheers you, babe?
Cheers the nipple.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
Free the nipple.
- Free the nipple, babe.

36:11.999 --> 36:13.999
- Me and Scheana had sex today.
It was awesome.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
- Like the make love kind
or the f*** kind?

36:15.999 --> 36:16.999
- Oh, it was the f*** kind.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
- We haven't had sex yet
since we've been here.

36:18.999 --> 36:20.999
- Seriously? We did it
before you guys did it?

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
I've been trying.
- We're married.

36:22.999 --> 36:23.999
- She's been trying.

36:23.999 --> 36:25.999
- That's when you kind of
really knows

36:25.999 --> 36:29.999
that he cares about this one,
because he's turning down sex.

36:29.999 --> 36:30.999
- I've never in my life
turned down sex.

36:30.999 --> 36:33.000
- I don't know if that makes me
feel safer or not.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
- I'm--you know, I'm all in.
I'm all in on this one.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
I barely even drink,
to be honest.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
I have nothing to hide.

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
- Even though everyone tells me
I shouldn't, I trust him

36:42.000 --> 36:43.999
since, you know, he hasn't
done anything to me so far

36:43.999 --> 36:44.999
so why wouldn't I?

36:44.999 --> 36:45.999
- Until I break that trust,
there's no reason not to.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
- Yeah.
Exactly.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
- Jax is a very smooth talker,

36:50.999 --> 36:54.999
and Brittany is a sweet girl
from Kentucky.

36:54.999 --> 36:55.999
I think that she deserves
to know the truth

36:55.999 --> 36:58.999
about what Jax has said to me.

37:01.999 --> 37:03.999
- Yeah.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
Um, earlier today,

37:10.999 --> 37:14.999
when you and I had a
conversation at the waterfall,

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
I was really hoping
that he would man up

37:16.999 --> 37:19.999
when I was talking to you
and take his part.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
That night, where we were
at Lock and Key...

37:21.999 --> 37:22.999
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
- I did not think you guys
were together,

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
and I definitely flirted back,

37:26.999 --> 37:29.999
but he played a part
in it as well.

37:29.999 --> 37:32.999
- Wonder what bullsh**
Lala's feeding Brittany.

37:32.999 --> 37:36.999
- He was telling me
he was going to f*** me.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
- So wait, he was telling you
he was going to f*** you?

37:38.999 --> 37:40.999
- Yeah.

37:40.999 --> 37:41.999
You know, like whispering
in my ear,

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
"Don't worry.
I'm going to f*** you."

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- Jax, Goddamn you.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
- So he's just, like, bending
over and whispering that--

37:52.999 --> 37:56.999
I mean, I'm just confused
right now 'cause he was like,

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
"I didn't do anything.

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
It's fine.
I wouldn't do anything."

37:58.999 --> 38:01.999
- He absolutely said that to me.

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
Like, obviously,
I was flirtatious,

38:03.999 --> 38:06.999
but the fact that he pretends
like I'm the one that's been,

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
like, chasing him
and doing all that?

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- Yeah.
- That's not the case.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.999
- You said that you didn't know
that we were together.

38:17.999 --> 38:19.999
- I didn't know that you
were together at all.

38:19.999 --> 38:22.000
- Well, even whenever I met you,
I was with Jax.

38:22.999 --> 38:23.999
- But why are we
talking about--why?

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
This has nothing to do
with that.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
- But you told me
you respect relationships.

38:26.999 --> 38:28.000
- I do.
There is a huge diff--

38:28.000 --> 38:29.999
- So how is that
respecting relationships?

38:29.999 --> 38:31.000
- Are you really going
to turn this on me

38:31.000 --> 38:33.999
when your man
has done--like, really?

38:33.999 --> 38:34.999
- Do you not see it
from my point of view?

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
I'm replaying it in my head
and I was like,

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
"What the f***," you know?

38:38.999 --> 38:39.999
- Have I flirted with him?

38:39.999 --> 38:43.999
- No, you have been fine.
- So what's the problem?

38:43.999 --> 38:44.999
I'm just so confused
by everybody being

38:44.999 --> 38:46.999
in this head space
where, like,

38:46.999 --> 38:48.000
they're not confident enough
to have their man

38:48.000 --> 38:49.999
around other women--

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
- It's not that I'm
not confident enough,

38:50.999 --> 38:52.000
'cause I definitely am,

38:52.000 --> 38:55.999
and I think that Jax is not
going to do anything stupid.

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
I know he loves me.
I know he's crazy about me.

38:57.999 --> 39:01.999
But at the same time,
don't do that sh**.

39:03.999 --> 39:04.999
- Talk is cheap, Honey Boo Boo.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
- Okay, okay.
Don't call me Honey Boo Boo.

39:07.999 --> 39:10.000
- I'm so sick of,
like, defending myself.

39:10.999 --> 39:11.999
I'm sitting here
telling you the truth,

39:11.999 --> 39:14.999
and he sits there and pretends
like he had no part in it.

39:14.999 --> 39:16.000
I'm not going down
with the ship anymore.

39:16.999 --> 39:17.999
This is bullsh**.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
- If he's telling me that
it's not true and everything,

39:19.999 --> 39:21.999
he hasn't done anything to me

39:21.999 --> 39:24.999
where I feel like
I couldn't trust him.

39:24.999 --> 39:26.999
- Brittany is in
f***ing denial.

39:26.999 --> 39:27.999
Jax is not a good dude,

39:27.999 --> 39:30.999
and I hope that she will
figure it out sooner or later.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.999
- All right.

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
I'm going to go talk to Jax now.

39:45.999 --> 39:46.999
- Come talk to me somewhere.

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
- Ugh.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.999
- I'm like, annoyed.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
- How did that go?

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
- So, she basically was saying

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
that whenever you guys
were at Lock and Key,

40:01.999 --> 40:06.999
you were saying, "Don't worry,
I'm going to f*** you."

40:06.999 --> 40:07.999
- I said, "Don't worry,
I'm going to f*** you"?

40:07.999 --> 40:09.999
- That's what she said.

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
So you didn't say that?

40:11.999 --> 40:14.000
- No.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
I was with Scheana and Kristen.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.999
- Why would she say that?
Why--

40:18.999 --> 40:20.999
- She was drunk.
She's trying to protect herself.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
She's been thrown
to the wolves right now.

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
I'm not gonna get
that mad about it

40:24.999 --> 40:25.999
because I didn't say it,
so I'm not--I'd be going crazy,

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
like, uh, if I was trying
to be, like, hide something.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
But that's just--that's irate.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
That's stupid.
- Let's call her over here then.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
Lala.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.999
- What's up?

40:40.999 --> 40:41.999
- He said he didn't say it.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
- Jax--
- I didn't say anything.

40:43.999 --> 40:46.999
- Yes, you did.

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
- No--I was with Kristen
and Scheana the whole time.

40:49.999 --> 40:50.999
- And you were
with me, whisper--

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
- All right, you can believe
that all you want.

40:52.999 --> 40:53.999
She was piss drunk.

40:53.999 --> 40:54.999
- Own up to the sh**
you said in my ear.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
- I never said anything.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
- You said, "I promise,
I'm going to f*** you."

40:58.999 --> 41:01.999
- No, I never said that.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41:01.999 --> 41:04.999
- I never said that.

41:04.999 --> 41:05.999
- Look me dead
in my f***ing eyes.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
- I never said that.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
- You're a good liar
'cause you did say that.

41:09.999 --> 41:12.999
- Did I say some things
I probably shouldn't have?

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
Mm, I maybe danced
on that line a little bit,

41:14.999 --> 41:17.999
but Brittany doesn't need
to know all the details.

41:17.999 --> 41:18.999
What she needs to know
is I'm with her

41:19.000 --> 41:20.999
and I want to be with her,
and that's it.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
I never said that.
- Yes, you did!

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
- What the f*** is going on?

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
- She told me that when you guys
were at Lock and Key,

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
Jax was whispering
in her ear saying, like,

41:28.999 --> 41:32.999
"Don't worry,
I'm going to f*** you."

41:32.999 --> 41:33.999
- I didn't see the whispering.

41:33.999 --> 41:36.999
I saw him kind of squirming
in his seat.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
I really like Brittany,

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
and I don't want to be the one

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
to completely ruin
the relationship

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
so I'm going to cover for him.

41:44.999 --> 41:47.999
- Hello? I've been honest.
Be honest.

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
- I am being honest.
- You're not.

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
You told me you would f*** me.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
You said it to me.

41:51.999 --> 41:52.999
"Don't worry,
I'm going to f*** you."

41:52.999 --> 41:53.999
- Clearly, I didn't hear
that part.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.000
- Right, but you did
say it, Jax.

41:55.999 --> 41:56.999
- I did not say that.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
- I'm done.

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
Brittany, all I know is I've
told you nothing but the truth

42:01.999 --> 42:04.999
and whatever happens with you,
like, I don't care.

42:08.999 --> 42:11.999
I'm over it.
This is, like, bullsh**.

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
After an entire night and day
of being ganged up on,

42:13.999 --> 42:16.999
the only thing that I want
is to be left alone.

42:18.999 --> 42:22.999
I've been nothing
but honest with people.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.000
I'm over it.
I'm done.

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
- Come on.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
- Lala.
You're missing your bottoms.

42:46.999 --> 42:49.999
You're hot as f***, but you
make people uncomfortable.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.999
- Get the f*** over it.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
- If you would have told me
Katie's going to get engaged

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
to Tom Schwartz,

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
and we aren't going
to be there...

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
- It's sad.

42:59.999 --> 43:03.999
- She's still that
little f***ing bitch.

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
- I'm taking this.
- No.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
- There's a felony charge

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
that's still
under investigation.

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
- Boom, he's in jail.

43:09.999 --> 43:13.999
- Who's going to post the bail?

43:13.999 --> 43:16.999
