00:29.320 --> 00:30.960
Thanks for covering for me last Friday.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.080
Date went...  ...poorly though,

00:34.160 --> 00:35.600
so I'm still yours.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.680
See ya.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.040
I have a bad feeling about this one.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.240
You worry too much.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.240
Yes!

02:27.440 --> 02:28.280
It's amazing.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.600
You must be so proud, Dan.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.240
You bet I am.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.600
-Do I know you?
-No.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.520
-How do you know my name?
-I know a lot of things.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.560
Here.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.200
What's this?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.160
Oh, come on, you know.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.400
Don't you?

02:51.360 --> 02:53.320
I dunno who the hell you think
you're talking to.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.320
It's hard to believe that no one's
ever raised this with you before.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.760
Raised what?

02:58.920 --> 02:59.800
Dan...

03:01.800 --> 03:02.920
Look at your son.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.600
His weight was...

03:05.440 --> 03:06.280
what last year?

03:06.840 --> 03:09.840
It's called puberty, asshole.
It's called working out hard.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.160
No, Dan. It's called a PED,

03:12.240 --> 03:14.160
"performance enhancing drug."

03:14.920 --> 03:17.120
Better known to the layman as "steroids."

03:18.760 --> 03:19.720
What did you just say?

03:20.880 --> 03:22.760
Well, all the proof is in that envelope.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.160
It shows how often he bought it,

03:26.640 --> 03:28.120
the methods of payment,

03:28.200 --> 03:29.760
even the IP address

03:29.840 --> 03:31.040
on your home computer.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.160
What will they think
when they hear your son's a cheat?

03:38.720 --> 03:39.760
Are you threatening me?

03:39.840 --> 03:40.680
No.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.640
I'm asking you for 10,000 pounds,
one-time payment.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.120
I could demand a lot more.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.440
Look, you see Alex Thompson down there?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.760
He used to take first place
before Kenny started using.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.760
Your son wins and your son beats him...

04:02.880 --> 04:05.800
and then kids like that,
they miss out on sponsorships,

04:06.120 --> 04:07.640
international events.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.120
You know, he's even starting to think
of taking that shit just to keep up.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.000
You think your son's actions
are a victimless crime?

04:16.080 --> 04:18.360
It creates a ripple effect.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.280
And then innocent people get hurt, Dan.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.160
Come on.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.400
"You worry too much."

04:44.800 --> 04:45.680
Ha!

04:56.840 --> 04:59.280
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

04:59.360 --> 05:01.920
<i>♪ Danger knocking at my door ♪</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:04.800
<i>♪ Don't come 'round here no more ♪</i>

05:05.000 --> 05:07.360
<i>♪ I check the locks</i>
<i>Shut the windows down ♪</i>

05:07.440 --> 05:10.400
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

05:18.520 --> 05:21.400
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

05:21.480 --> 05:23.520
We don't know yet
what's wrong with Olivia,

05:23.600 --> 05:24.880
but she's stable.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.640
We're gonna run some blood tests,

05:26.720 --> 05:29.320
and expect your daughter
to be discharged later today.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.920
Daddy's got your back.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.680
And you're gonna get better.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.280
And it all will have been worth it.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.400
Oh, God, Dad,
stop crying, you weirdo.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.040
I'm not crying.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.000
While you were sleeping, you let off
a massive fart. It made my eyes water.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.080
Stop.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.000
But I still love you.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.000
So do you know where Corinne is?

06:23.720 --> 06:24.680
She's missing.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.760
I filed a report here two days ago.
How have you not seen that?

06:31.240 --> 06:34.120
It can sometimes take a few days
for a missing persons report--

06:34.200 --> 06:36.560
Are you saying that nobody from here
has been looking for her?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.480
I can promise you now I'm involved,

06:38.560 --> 06:40.600
we will get this sorted immediately.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.760
I just need you to answer
a few questions for me, okay?

06:49.880 --> 06:51.520
Could you tell me what you're looking at?

06:51.600 --> 06:54.600
It's Corinne's school key fob.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.720
And do you recognize
the woman in the photo?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.160
No. I've never seen her before.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.160
This is a photo of Heidi Doyle,

07:09.240 --> 07:12.000
<i>the proprietor of the Brown Sugar Café,</i>

07:12.400 --> 07:15.160
<i>which is also the place</i>
<i>she was found murdered.</i>

07:15.480 --> 07:18.280
<i>Your wife's key fob</i>
<i>was found at the scene.</i>

07:20.240 --> 07:21.680
This doesn't make any sense.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.920
You say your wife's gone missing.
How long?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.280
Since Monday.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.280
We had a row.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.400
What about?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.120
A few days before she went missing,

07:31.200 --> 07:34.520
I was approached by a woman, a stranger.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.640
She told me something about Corinne

07:39.040 --> 07:40.280
<i>that I didn't know.</i>

07:40.840 --> 07:41.800
<i>A secret.</i>

07:41.880 --> 07:44.200
<i>And I confronted Corinne about it.</i>

07:44.680 --> 07:46.640
-That's what the row was about?
-Right.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.320
We were gonna meet, but...

07:50.560 --> 07:52.200
she just didn't turn up.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.720
And then I got this text
saying that she needed time and...

07:55.800 --> 07:59.760
I know what you're gonna say,
but it's just not like Corinne at all.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.680
We've got two boys.
She would never abandon them like this.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.240
So...

08:04.880 --> 08:08.680
What was the secret
this stranger told you about your wife?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.400
She told me that...

08:10.880 --> 08:12.440
a few years back, Corinne...

08:15.200 --> 08:17.160
faked a pregnancy.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.440
A fake belly, everything.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.000
And eventually, she faked...

08:25.080 --> 08:26.560
a miscarriage.

08:29.480 --> 08:33.160
The stranger told me to check
the bank account, which I did, and...

08:34.920 --> 08:35.960
it was all there.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.800
But how did this stranger

08:39.880 --> 08:40.960
know all of this?

08:41.840 --> 08:43.040
I don't know.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.000
She wouldn't tell me, but...

08:48.960 --> 08:50.360
That's the thing, right?

08:50.440 --> 08:53.360
She turns up all mysterious
and drops bombs on people,

08:53.440 --> 08:55.120
fucking with their lives, and then...

08:55.760 --> 08:56.640
...gone.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.400
People? So there are others?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.120
Yeah, there was a... um...

09:01.520 --> 09:03.880
a woman... I forget her name.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.520
She-- Her fiancé put out some revenge porn

09:07.600 --> 09:11.160
and then another woman, Suzanne Hobbs,
she was being blackmailed.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.400
Can you describe
this stranger to me?

09:16.480 --> 09:17.840
<i>She was a young woman.</i>

09:18.400 --> 09:20.800
<i>Mid- to late 20s, average height.</i>

09:20.920 --> 09:24.080
<i>She wore a baseball cap</i>
<i>and a bomber jacket.</i>

09:24.160 --> 09:26.120
<i>And she got into a gray car</i>

09:26.200 --> 09:27.640
<i>with a blond woman.</i>

09:28.120 --> 09:29.040
Move.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.360
It's really hard for me to feel sorry
for you right now.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.240
I'm too angry.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.040
Told you how stupid this was.
Now you look like shit.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.200
Awesome. Thanks so much.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.640
Don't try and be clever right now.
You're just pissing me off even more.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.480
What the hell was that back there? Huh?

10:00.320 --> 10:03.200
Come on. There are risks
in what we do, you know that.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.720
That man was full-on ready to kill you.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.880
-What did you say to him?
-Just the truth.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.680
You went too far again, didn't you?

10:11.080 --> 10:12.240
Teased him?

10:12.520 --> 10:13.960
Do you get off on this crap?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.680
This isn't you.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.680
What the hell's been going on lately?

10:28.480 --> 10:29.360
Hello?

10:30.960 --> 10:31.880
I'm going out.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.320
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.040
Thanks.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.040
Any word on Corinne?

10:56.360 --> 10:57.280
Nothing.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.800
All right, let's go get the kids.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.400
Good goal.
Good start, boys, come on.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.680
Pick a corner, Ryan. Pick a corner.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.960
Yes! Ryan!

11:33.080 --> 11:34.240
-Mom?
-Well done, mate.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.720
Nothing yet. We'll find her.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
Hey! We're in the middle
of practice here.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.360
Ryan, do you wanna be
on the bench all of next week?

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
-Go on, mate. I'll talk to you later.
-No, sir.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.280
-No more distractions at my practice.
-Yeah, all right.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.680
Piss off, Bob.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.840
Easy.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.480
Asshole.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.640
What?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.800
Oh, yeah, we're two good-looking blokes.
We know.

12:04.880 --> 12:05.880
-Why don't you--
-Come on.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.480
Why don't you focus on your kids?

12:07.840 --> 12:10.200
Bit more effort, boys,
bit more effort.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.440
What's up?

12:11.920 --> 12:14.760
They called me to the police station
because they found Corinne's key fob

12:14.840 --> 12:16.040
at a murder scene.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.000
-Holy shit.
-Yeah.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.240
None of this makes any sense.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.440
What with that, and the... the money
and Corinne disappearing...

12:27.760 --> 12:28.680
What am I missing?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.960
Please, this isn't what you think.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.640
There's more to this.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.880
I have to find her.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.280
What are you doing here?

12:58.920 --> 13:01.960
There's a court case going on, you know?
You're breaking the law!

13:02.960 --> 13:04.880
This house isn't supposed
to be demolished!

13:05.480 --> 13:07.120
Piss off, ya fucking...!

13:07.200 --> 13:08.520
Just vandals!

13:12.360 --> 13:13.480
Parasites!

13:19.640 --> 13:22.440
Daisy was supposed to be here,
like, 20 minutes ago.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.320
I'm sure she'll be here in a few minutes.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.080
Ah, she can't make it.
She's in trouble with her mom.

13:37.880 --> 13:38.840
All right.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.120
So you tell me what the hell's going on.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.400
-Come on, mate, just--
-Shut up, Thomas!

13:46.480 --> 13:48.360
Give her a second, she'll be here.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.360
Boys, what was all that about?

13:53.440 --> 13:55.640
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hoy.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.840
We're aware that Daisy's
in a bit of trouble with you,

13:57.920 --> 14:00.600
and I am completely confident
in your abilities to parent,

14:00.680 --> 14:04.360
but could we just talk to her
about something kind of important?

14:04.440 --> 14:08.200
But not important enough for you to worry
about anything... thing. Real quick.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.880
Daisy's not in any trouble.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.960
Mom, it's fine.
Come up to my room, guys.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.800
Okay, thanks so much, Mrs. Hoy.
It's nice talking to you. You look great.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.640
-You think I'm some kind of pedo?
-Shh!

14:29.720 --> 14:31.200
You think I'm some kind of pedo?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.880
-What the fuck?
-Don't "what the fuck" him!

14:32.960 --> 14:34.600
-He's my best friend!
-He's my best friend.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.120
I didn't tell him everything.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.080
What do you mean,
"Haven't told him everything"?

14:38.160 --> 14:39.720
I asked you not to! I begged you.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.280
Why are you lying about being grounded?
This is so unfair--

14:42.360 --> 14:45.160
Thomas, I can't handle any of this!
It's too much!

14:45.800 --> 14:48.640
You think I sent baby vagina pictures

14:48.720 --> 14:50.360
from your baby sister's phone

14:50.440 --> 14:52.160
to her entire contact list

14:52.240 --> 14:53.760
full of stupid babies?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.920
I only told him that,
and I didn't say it like that.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.280
Only that. What else is there to know?

14:58.360 --> 14:59.240
He didn't do it, Dais.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.120
He wasn't even in school that day.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.400
I was at home sick,

15:02.480 --> 15:04.240
with stomach problems.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.240
Look at this.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.160
Here's my doctor's note.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Here's an email I sent to all the teachers
saying I was sick

15:12.080 --> 15:13.760
and to send me the homework.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.840
Here's a time and date stamped text
I sent my mom.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.760
"Mom, please pick up some more antacid

15:18.840 --> 15:21.320
and several more rolls of toilet paper."

15:21.640 --> 15:25.440
Here's a selfie of me looking sick
but low-key adorable

15:25.520 --> 15:27.640
that I sent to all the girls
on my Snapchat,

15:27.720 --> 15:29.560
including you, might I add.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.400
Oh, and here's a pic
of the massive dump I took

15:32.480 --> 15:34.320
to show my doctor
to make sure I wasn't dying!

15:34.400 --> 15:35.640
Okay, Mike, okay!

15:35.720 --> 15:37.840
Just shut up for two seconds
and I'll tell you, okay?

15:39.440 --> 15:42.200
I heard from someone that you
sent those photos from Ella's phone.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.480
-Who and why?
-I heard that.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.880
And I wanna cry every time I see Ella.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.000
Do you understand how much
this has fucked with her?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.520
She's completely scarred.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.480
Yeah, that's super sad and all that,

15:52.560 --> 15:56.000
but also not my fault,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.360
even a little bit, because I didn't do it.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.360
Okay, I believe you.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.040
I believe you now,
but I believed it when I heard it

16:05.120 --> 16:07.000
and I was completely blind with rage.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.480
<i>so I spiked your joint with PCP.</i>

16:09.560 --> 16:10.840
I have a present for you.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.600
<i>I just wanted you to humiliate yourself</i>
<i>even a fraction of the amount</i>

16:13.680 --> 16:15.520
that I thought you humiliated Ella.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.200
So that's why you went crazy
and beheaded that alpaca.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.400
You were out of your mind,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.640
and I'm worried that you might
have had something to do

16:22.720 --> 16:24.240
with Dante, and it's all my fault.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.840
PCP?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.760
What the hell, Daisy?

16:30.560 --> 16:33.440
Why the hell would your first thought be,

16:33.520 --> 16:34.840
"Oh, let's give Mike

16:34.920 --> 16:37.960
the most deadliest
and unpredictable drug I know"?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.240
I've never been so angry.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.520
Why the hell wouldn't you just, like,
give me a laxative or something?

16:43.600 --> 16:44.920
Make me shit my pants?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.320
Wouldn't me be shitting myself
be enough for you?

16:47.400 --> 16:49.280
-You have every reason to be angry.
-Daisy...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.280
I turned up at Thomas's house

16:52.360 --> 16:53.680
with the head of an alpaca.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.800
Not to mention, that same night,

16:56.880 --> 16:59.120
Dante Gunnarsson was left ass-naked

16:59.200 --> 17:00.600
and unconscious.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.760
If he dies, it turns
into a murder investigation.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
And what if I'm the one
who did that to him?

17:10.920 --> 17:13.560
Olivia. She told me you sent the photos.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.960
Who the hell's Olivia?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.200
Olivia Katz?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.360
Sick Olivia?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.800
Oh, that psycho.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.920
She's in love with me.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.760
-God, I hate men.
-No, for real.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.480
Olivia Katz, she's absolute batshit.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.720
I passed her a tissue
in maths a few weeks ago

17:31.800 --> 17:34.080
because she kept sniffing
and it was really annoying.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.600
And she just thought it was
a declaration of love or something.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.480
We need to go talk to Olivia.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.360
Look at her.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.960
Brushing her hair
like some sort of sociopath.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.400
Maybe we should wait till school.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.360
Nope.

17:52.440 --> 17:56.120
Sorry, Dais, but you've proven yourself
to be absolute trash

17:56.200 --> 17:57.760
when it comes to decision making.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.880
Maybe I should get the door
this time, yeah?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.600
-Hi.
-Hello.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.000
Are you Olivia's mom?

18:19.080 --> 18:19.920
Yes.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.280
Uh, we just wanted to come by
and ask her some questions about physics.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.680
Olivia's in the hospital at the moment.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.800
I'm not sure whether you've heard,
but her illness is acting up.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.360
-We just--
-I'm going to see her now

18:31.440 --> 18:33.440
-but I'll tell her you stopped by.
-Well, maybe...

18:34.760 --> 18:35.760
Um...

18:36.640 --> 18:38.760
I mean, why don't we come with you?

18:40.440 --> 18:43.040
I'm sure it would be nice for her
to see some familiar faces, yeah?

18:43.360 --> 18:46.880
What is it with you and your mother
sticking your noses into our business?

18:48.520 --> 18:50.200
Olivia is a sick child.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.200
Whatever you have to say to her...

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
can and will wait.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.280
Hey.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.160
Where have you been?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.280
Ah, I take it you're still mad at me.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.480
It's 'cause I care about you.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.280
You said we'd get out of this game

19:29.360 --> 19:31.320
once we had enough money
to buy the beach bar,

19:31.400 --> 19:33.640
which was months ago.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.760
It's always, "Just another target,
just a little bit longer."

19:36.840 --> 19:39.920
We're gonna get that bar, but you know
this isn't about the money for me.

19:40.000 --> 19:40.840
Christ's sake!

19:40.920 --> 19:44.000
-Not this philosophical bullshit again.
-It's not bullshit.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.080
We're doing good.
A secret revealed is a secret destroyed.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.840
That's pretty hypocritical,

19:50.920 --> 19:53.200
seeing as how you've been
keeping secrets from me.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.120
We normally talk about everything.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
I know there's things
you're not telling me.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.480
I just need a little bit more time,

20:06.560 --> 20:07.400
okay?

20:09.960 --> 20:13.080
Maybe if we have enough money
we'll put in one of those...

20:13.720 --> 20:16.640
retro karaoke machines
that you love so much.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.160
No more clearly aggressive targets.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.880
Believe it or not, I'm not actually a fan
of Tasering middle-aged dads.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.000
Right. Deal.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.240
Have we heard anything
from Heidi Doyle yet?

20:47.520 --> 20:48.400
Not a peep.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.400
That's weird.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.760
You were there. You saw how she was.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.640
There's no way that she wasn't gonna pay.

20:55.960 --> 20:56.880
I'll look her up.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.400
Oh, my God.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.680
Oh, my God.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.360
Go to the office, close it down.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.200
I'm sure this is just a coincidence.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.520
Get rid of everything,
anything that ties us to her,

21:16.600 --> 21:17.680
and I'll take care of here.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.000
This is the emergency we prepared for.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.560
You know what to do. Go, now.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.320
<i>Turns up all mysterious</i>
<i>and drops bombs on people,</i>

21:34.400 --> 21:36.000
fucking with their lives and then...

21:36.760 --> 21:39.600
-just gone.
- <i>Look into her finances.</i>

21:39.680 --> 21:41.400
Someone was trying to blackmail her.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.760
- Johanna? Johanna?
-Hmm?

21:44.760 --> 21:46.520
Your fancy man's here to see you.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.200
My what?

21:59.120 --> 21:59.960
Right.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.600
One for you.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.120
One for me.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.000
This is a surprise.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.760
But it's good, yeah?

22:13.680 --> 22:14.840
Kind of romantic?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.840
Sorry, sorry. I meant--
I meant "friendly."

22:19.920 --> 22:21.120
Not "romantic."

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
Old habits.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.920
Actually, no.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
No, I'm not sorry.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
Jo, look at me.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.040
Do you still wanna...?

22:40.840 --> 22:43.720
Do you still wanna do
the whole separation thing?

22:46.160 --> 22:47.840
Phillip, we've--
we've been over this,

22:47.920 --> 22:50.480
and you and I both know
it's the right thing to do.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.760
With everything going on with Heidi...

22:52.840 --> 22:56.720
Well, hasn't that just made you more sure
that we've made the right call?

22:59.600 --> 23:02.480
We've been together forever
and our marriage has not been a failure,

23:02.560 --> 23:04.960
but we are in a rut, Phillip,
and life's too short for that.

23:05.040 --> 23:08.720
If anything, it's made me more sure you're
making a big mistake by ending this.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.680
I've been a crap wife to you,
and you know it.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.160
You're just used to me.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.720
It's like when you gave up Diet Coke
a few years back.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.440
I'm just a habit you've got to break.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.600
You're not crap, Jo.

23:22.680 --> 23:26.000
Hey, I said I'm a crap wife.
I'm great besides that.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.520
Jo, I'm not joking around here.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.080
I'm not gonna make you do anything
you don't wanna do.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.160
But I know you.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.240
I know you better than anyone.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.240
You good, Johanna?

24:11.320 --> 24:12.160
Yep.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.240
Yeah, I'm all good.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.520
Hey, where the hell
is the Corinne Price file?

24:21.600 --> 24:24.800
And does anyone know why she's not
on the missing person database?

24:25.640 --> 24:27.400
That woman isn't missing.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.720
The husband said they had a row.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.560
And she texted to say
she needed some time away.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
Wha...?

24:39.120 --> 24:40.400
I didn't think a, um...

24:41.560 --> 24:44.000
marital spat was a priority,

24:44.080 --> 24:47.080
what with the murder investigation
going on.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.760
I didn't think it was important. Sorry.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.680
Hey, that's the woman
from the Dante Gunnarsson video.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.320
<i>Do you think he saw something</i>
<i>and she tried to off him?</i>

25:03.920 --> 25:06.440
We need to speak to someone
at Corinne's school

25:06.520 --> 25:09.720
and try and figure out how this all fits.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.040
Hey, sorry, I've gotta take this. Hey.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.480
They're trying to intimidate me.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.960
The road is full of demolition equipment.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.280
<i>What? They can't.</i>

25:20.760 --> 25:24.400
They said the appeal didn't go through.
Planning on demolishing today.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.400
Okay. Um...

25:26.000 --> 25:27.720
Let me put in a call to Parth.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.880
<i>-There must be some mistake.</i>
-Okay, thanks.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.560
Now, um, I have some good news
as well, though.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.920
I found the elusive Ingrid Prisby,
one of the women you're looking for.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.960
Really?

25:40.040 --> 25:42.480
One name she goes by is Gabrielle Dunbar.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.520
And get this,

25:43.600 --> 25:46.600
Gabrielle Dunbar owns
or works at a detective agency

25:46.680 --> 25:48.600
<i>just a few towns over from you.</i>

25:48.680 --> 25:50.640
She knows how they found out
all those secrets.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.880
Makes sense. It looks like this company
is known for digging up dirt on people.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.160
<i>-I've got an address.</i>
-Gotta go.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.160
Okay. Thanks, Martin.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.680
Polly, can you get the kids
back for us? Cheers, mate.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.480
What's going on?

26:06.560 --> 26:08.640
I think I found someone
who knows where Corinne is.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.560
-All right.
-I'll drive.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.040
There it is.

26:20.760 --> 26:21.640
Yeah, she's here.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.880
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.160
Pick up.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.240
Why do you think she said that
about my mum?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.720
Can we just go home?
What if Mrs. Katz sees us again?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.360
That woman's gonna haunt my nightmares.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.000
I'll literally pay you
if you shut up.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.040
Daisy, it's okay.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.800
But no one can see us from here.
What's up with you?

26:56.640 --> 27:00.000
I want everything settled with Olivia,
and it'd be better to do that at school

27:00.080 --> 27:02.200
rather than waiting outside
of her house like creeps.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.400
Shut up, she's coming.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.440
Shit, she's seen us.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.960
Stay down.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.600
That was weird.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.080
Why did she do that?

27:20.280 --> 27:22.080
Did she just put that
in the neighbor's bin?

27:23.240 --> 27:24.880
We need to look through the rubbish.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.200
Mike, she could see you!

27:28.280 --> 27:29.640
Oh, my God, hurry!

27:41.520 --> 27:43.520
Medicine, syringes...

27:45.560 --> 27:46.960
What the hell is going on?

27:53.640 --> 27:54.840
<i>Hello, security.</i>

27:54.920 --> 27:56.840
Bobby, it's Gabbi. Don't react to this.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.600
I just saw my abusive
ex-boyfriend walk in.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.560
<i>He's tall, dark hair.</i>

28:00.640 --> 28:02.440
<i>Whatever you do,</i>
<i>don't let him know I'm here.</i>

28:03.200 --> 28:04.440
I'll take care of it.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.040
I'm here to see Gabrielle Dunbar.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.200
All right, just...

28:12.120 --> 28:12.960
Made a new friend?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.000
He won't let me in.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.400
They're hiding something.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.400
What do you wanna do?

28:20.480 --> 28:22.120
I can't go. What if she leaves?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.760
This could be my only chance.
She knows where Corinne is, I'm sure.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.600
Well, we can wait here all day
and all bloody night

28:28.680 --> 28:30.160
if that's what you need, mate. Okay?

28:31.080 --> 28:32.880
If I'd known we were doing
a proper stakeout,

28:32.960 --> 28:34.720
would've made you
buy me snacks beforehand.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.600
<i>Thank you for meeting us here</i>
<i>at such short notice.</i>

28:47.840 --> 28:49.560
I'm just so worried about Corinne.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.040
We all are.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
Do you know what this is?

28:57.120 --> 28:59.280
Yes, it's a key fob
for the school.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.320
This one's expired though.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.120
They changed the design about a year ago.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.040
Have you ever seen Corinne
with this woman,

29:16.120 --> 29:18.600
or heard the name Heidi Doyle?

29:18.680 --> 29:19.760
I don't think so, no.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.120
Can you tell me about Corinne?

29:26.920 --> 29:28.000
Amazing teacher.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.400
Loved by students,

29:30.480 --> 29:31.520
teachers...

29:32.320 --> 29:33.200
parents.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.880
So her not turning up for work,
going off the grid--

29:35.960 --> 29:37.320
Is completely out of character.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.680
I think in the whole time I've known her,
she's missed one day of class.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.800
Makes the rest of us look bad.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.440
Corinne's husband, Adam...

29:48.320 --> 29:50.360
can you describe their relationship?

29:52.840 --> 29:55.680
If you asked a few weeks ago, I would
have said everything seemed perfect.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.680
But Corinne's been acting strangely
these last few weeks.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.920
Not, "I'm gonna run off
and disappear," but...

30:03.000 --> 30:04.640
-different.
-How do you mean?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.040
She seemed stressed.

30:08.040 --> 30:08.960
Tense.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.120
She wouldn't tell me what was going on.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.880
I just figured that there was
something going on at home.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.160
Like what?

30:16.680 --> 30:17.800
Well...

30:17.880 --> 30:21.040
the day she disappeared,
Adam came to me asking about her.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.840
He said that she'd sent him a text
saying that she needed some space...

30:25.560 --> 30:26.640
and that they'd had a row.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.960
How did he seem when you were talking?

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
Agitated.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.680
Never seen him like that before.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.840
And did anything else come up
in the conversation?

30:39.560 --> 30:40.840
I don't think so.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.280
I remember him saying that
he didn't wanna go to the police just yet.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.240
But I think that's all.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.160
When we searched
Dante Gunnarsson's bedroom,

30:54.240 --> 30:57.400
we found footage of Corinne on his laptop.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.760
Now, it looks like
it was secretly filmed.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.960
Can you think
of any connections between Dante

31:04.040 --> 31:05.080
and Corinne?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.400
Just her being his teacher.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.480
He films some
of the Cedarfield football practices.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.800
I'd talk to Bob Baime about it.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.280
He's the head coach of the football club.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.760
Just think
it's a bit tedious to clean 'em

31:19.840 --> 31:23.000
when they're just gonna
get dirty again tomorrow, no?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.760
It's all about that success mentality,

31:26.960 --> 31:29.240
about preparing oneself for victory

31:29.320 --> 31:30.720
for all aspects of life.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.720
It's like people that don't
make their beds in the morning.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.040
Why should I bother making it when
I'm gonna get back into it later tonight?

31:39.200 --> 31:42.200
But the studies have shown,
time and time again,

31:42.280 --> 31:44.680
that the most successful people
in this world,

31:44.760 --> 31:46.640
CEOs, politicians,

31:47.120 --> 31:48.400
them guys,

31:48.480 --> 31:50.920
they grew up making their bed
every goddamn morning.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.200
All right, yeah.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.120
I'm DC Ross.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.320
This is DS Griffin.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.040
I presume you're here
about the stolen money.

32:03.120 --> 32:03.960
Stolen money?

32:07.000 --> 32:10.560
Oh, well, a certain treasurer of ours
who may happen to be missing

32:10.640 --> 32:13.640
is likely responsible for large sums
of money stolen from the club's account.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.560
And Corinne Price would be this treasurer.

32:15.640 --> 32:16.520
-Yes?
- Yes.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.320
So why didn't you come
straight to the police

32:19.400 --> 32:21.960
if you suspected Corinne Price
was stealing money from the club?

32:23.040 --> 32:24.760
We watched our kids grow up together.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.320
Been at the games here
together for years.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.480
So I wanted to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

32:31.640 --> 32:34.840
Wouldn't want to completely embarrass
the woman and her family.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.360
I'm not that kind of guy, you know?

32:37.560 --> 32:40.120
So if you're not here about the money,
what are you here for?

32:40.200 --> 32:41.120
We'll get to that.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.760
The Prices seem quite well-off,

32:43.840 --> 32:47.280
what with Adam being a partner
of a law firm.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.280
Is that not the case?

32:48.360 --> 32:49.280
Hey...

32:50.480 --> 32:52.680
people steal
for the thrill of it sometimes.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.120
Or maybe they're hiding something
from their spouse.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.280
Rich people steal as well, you know?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.360
Fair enough.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.800
Dante Gunnarsson,

33:03.880 --> 33:06.960
he used to film
your football practices, yeah?

33:07.400 --> 33:08.800
Ah, Dante.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.040
Poor kid. I hope he's okay.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.440
Yeah, he used to film our matches but...

33:15.520 --> 33:18.480
I mean, I'm obviously hoping
for the best for him.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.280
But Dante's a weird kid.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.520
You know, kind of lurky.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.040
So have you got any idea
why he'd have secretly filmed footage

33:28.120 --> 33:29.840
of Corinne Price on his computer?

33:30.400 --> 33:31.600
No, like I said,

33:32.160 --> 33:33.160
weird kid.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.480
Doesn't surprise me.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.720
If you don't mind, I've gotta run.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.760
Got a job interview.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.480
Actually, a pretty important one.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.000
Wait.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.400
Hey.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.200
Hope you get the job.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.280
Sure I will.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.040
Hey.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.880
-What?
-She's leaving.

34:25.040 --> 34:25.960
Oh, shit.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.200
A car chase? Seriously?

34:30.880 --> 34:32.120
Watch me chips!

34:33.880 --> 34:35.200
Which way did she go?

34:35.280 --> 34:36.600
Uh, that way, that way.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.800
-Fuck.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.040
Hold on.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.520
Adam, watch the car! Adam! Seriously!

34:59.920 --> 35:01.000
Shit.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.600
Watch out for this.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.200
-She's turned right!
-Shit.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.040
Jeez!

35:19.880 --> 35:21.560
Adam, you're not gonna make it.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.840
Adam! Jeez!

35:32.120 --> 35:33.160
She's getting away.

35:33.240 --> 35:35.040
Gonna get us killed,
driving like a maniac.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.800
Tripp, please, I have to stop her.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.920
Adam! Whoa!

35:47.560 --> 35:49.800
-Trying to get us both killed?
-I nearly had her!

35:49.880 --> 35:52.160
What are you gonna do?
Ram into her and kill us both?

35:52.680 --> 35:55.120
Right, I'm driving!
We've got families to think of!

35:58.720 --> 35:59.640
Fuck's sake.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.480
Martin.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.000
-Mind if I come in?
-Yes.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.680
We're not really gonna have
this conversation on the doorstep,

36:12.760 --> 36:13.600
are we?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.280
Just... just hear me out, okay?

36:20.080 --> 36:20.960
Humor me.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.200
So this place...

36:23.880 --> 36:25.720
I... I know what it means to you,

36:25.800 --> 36:28.760
what this whole neighborhood
means to both of us.

36:28.840 --> 36:29.960
But look at it.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.000
I mean, this place is decrepit.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.120
It's moldy.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.640
I mean, by letting it rot,

36:35.720 --> 36:38.800
you're disrespecting
the beautiful memories that it held.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.880
Anyway, just look at this.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.360
This place is paradise.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.200
There's this... heated salt water pools,

36:51.280 --> 36:53.880
tennis courts, 24-hour security.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.720
They even have a maid service

36:55.800 --> 36:57.760
that will come
and clean for you twice a week.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.440
Looks like that might be handy.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.560
But one two-bedroom home

37:02.640 --> 37:04.560
will go for £300,000.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.280
Now, you can't turn that down, Martin.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.120
Accept the offer. Come on.

37:13.840 --> 37:14.800
Not interested.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.920
Really now?

37:20.840 --> 37:21.920
You say you understand?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Hmm?

37:23.600 --> 37:25.040
We both know that's not true.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.000
You haven't the slightest clue
what's important.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.840
-You gave up on this neighborhood.
-Oh, please, don't.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.920
You expect me to just discard...

37:35.360 --> 37:39.120
my home and my life
for something new and shiny...

37:40.040 --> 37:42.640
just like how you discarded your wife
for a newer,

37:42.720 --> 37:44.600
-shinier model.
-Don't you overstep the mark.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.640
You left her!

37:46.520 --> 37:49.720
You left Adam to take care of her
when she was sick!

37:50.640 --> 37:53.040
You let him watch her die alone!

37:53.120 --> 37:54.720
And now you come in here

37:55.200 --> 37:58.280
and think you can get me
to change my mind?

38:02.320 --> 38:04.200
There's nothing noble
about staying here...

38:04.960 --> 38:05.800
Killane.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.440
You are a selfish, little man.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.920
By staying here in this dump

38:11.000 --> 38:13.320
you are denying new, young families

38:13.400 --> 38:14.960
the chance of somewhere to live.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.080
Get out.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.600
Fucker, get out!

38:20.080 --> 38:22.920
You know,
I thought I'd give you one last chance,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.200
just for old time's sake,
but it doesn't really matter.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.520
'Cause this place will be
a pile of rubble in two hours

38:28.600 --> 38:30.640
'cause we got
the demolition order through.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.400
Hello?

38:45.040 --> 38:45.920
Thomas?

39:14.440 --> 39:15.600
Hello, Parth?

39:15.680 --> 39:18.320
<i>Adam...</i>
<i>Killane's house. It's happening.</i>

39:18.400 --> 39:19.400
Now?

39:19.480 --> 39:20.480
What the...?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.800
Get out of here! You shouldn't be here!

39:23.880 --> 39:26.120
There's a court case going on, you know!

39:26.680 --> 39:27.920
You vandals!

39:29.520 --> 39:30.480
Stop it!

39:31.000 --> 39:33.320
I'm telling you to stop
whatever you're doing up there!

39:33.920 --> 39:35.120
You, stop it!

39:35.960 --> 39:38.400
If this house is going down,
then I'm going down with it!

39:38.480 --> 39:39.560
I'm his lawyer.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.360
-You have to leave--
-Fuck off!

39:43.440 --> 39:45.360
Martin, Martin, we've gotta go.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.520
-No!
-Look, we did everything we could.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.160
But it's just bricks and mortar, yeah?

39:52.320 --> 39:55.360
-It's over.
-I'm so sorry. Come on.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.400
You don't have to apologize to me.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.640
You've fought harder
than anyone else could've.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.000
I was stupid...

40:08.760 --> 40:10.880
to think that this could be stopped.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.800
It's a body!

40:41.920 --> 40:43.040
Let us through!

40:57.480 --> 40:58.600
I'm so sorry.
