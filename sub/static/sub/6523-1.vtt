02:16.040 --> 02:18.555
Mr. Burns, any comment
about your possible indictment?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.837
I must get to the hospital.
My wife's ill.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.116
I'm very sorry. Perhaps
you can empathize with the people...

02:25.360 --> 02:28.034
...who have been wiped out
of their entire life savings.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.919
- What about them?
- No comment.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.833
- How many people you hurt?
- No comment.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.434
You know how many...

02:33.760 --> 02:38.516
...senior citizens over the age of 65--?

02:38.760 --> 02:41.639
Mr. Burns may have had
no comment for KXBD...

02:41.880 --> 02:45.590
...but he may be compelled to find
his voice for the district attorney.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.675
Inquiries made by this reporter
prompted an investigation...

02:48.920 --> 02:53.278
<i>...into Ralph Burns and his role
in the Foothill Federal Bank scandal.</i>

02:53.880 --> 02:56.315
- We're not using that.
- It's an exclusive.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.233
- It's conjecture.
- It is not.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.917
Let me have another crack at him.
Tell him to answer my questions.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.278
- Why?
- You're not a judge. We're not a jury.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.637
- You know him, right?
- Yes, I know him.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.599
- You play golf with him.
- Occasionally.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.912
His wife has cancer.
He's under pressure. Leave him alone.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.435
Wait. Three questions.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.557
No, no and no.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.519
He's a sleaze.
He stole money.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.160
He took the savings of senior citizens.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.915
We say that the man has no comment
and we finish the piece.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.117
We don't ambush him at his work.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.558
I don't want to ambush him.
I just want to ask him one question.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.871
You are relentless, you know that?!

03:30.120 --> 03:32.191
You seem to forget
we cover the news...

03:32.440 --> 03:35.239
...of this area
for the people of this area.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.759
And we are not going anyplace.
Are we going anyplace, Max?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.951
- If they wanted me back in New York....
- They don't.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.235
You better come to terms with that.
I did.

03:46.480 --> 03:51.191
In the 11 months that I've been here,
you've gone from a 3 share to a 9.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.637
Excuse me!

03:52.880 --> 03:54.712
Excuse me, people!

03:54.960 --> 03:58.192
Whose week was it to kiss Max Brackett's
ass for saving this station?!

03:58.440 --> 04:00.636
The bank story might make you
look like network.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.031
No, not here.
There's a line I won't cross.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.112
- I'm not asking you to.
- Yes, you are.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.512
I am not. I'm saying,
you move the line, you get the story.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.194
You going out to the museum?

04:10.440 --> 04:11.715
Yes, trying to get it on
at noon.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.031
Mr. Brackett's taking that assignment.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.599
The state has let off
some people down there.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.718
It's a great story.
You'll relate to it.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.759
- I must finish my edit.
- I'll do it. What are friends for?

04:23.040 --> 04:24.520
You really are an asshole.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.275
- What am I?
- A wonderful human being.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.555
Why don't you go to the museum
with Mr. Brackett.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.395
You could run tape while you're there.
Maybe we'll use it tonight.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.790
She's an intern!

04:36.040 --> 04:39.670
Then you can be her mentor.
Teach her how to "move the line."

04:44.440 --> 04:45.556
I'm gay.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.231
Mr. Brackett....

05:07.480 --> 05:08.516
Max.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.872
Can I put a microphone on you?

05:11.480 --> 05:15.759
We'll get the curator to tell us why the
museum is facing drastic budget cuts.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.113
And then we'll find
a couple of locals to tell us...

05:20.360 --> 05:22.511
...that without a museum,
the city's a dog kennel.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.595
Then, as a brilliant career move,
you're taking me to lunch.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.192
- You have to answer.
- You're done.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.669
Is that the answer?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.320
You did it wrong.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.552
It's much better on the lapel.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.996
Can you help me?
We're looking for the curator.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.596
I know you. TV, right?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.274
- Right.
- You're the TV guy.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.916
You're the museum guy.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.913
No, I'm the guard.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.312
- The museum has financial problems?
- Tell me about it.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.597
There were 2 of us.
The other guy got laid off.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.480
- Is that right?
- You never know who'll be next.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.360
Stick around. Maybe we'll get you
to say that on camera.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.556
Really?

06:01.520 --> 06:02.874
Mrs. Banks' through there.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.839
Right. We don't pay much.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.634
More than I make here.

06:08.960 --> 06:13.432
They're not the Mohawks, Mr. Brackett.
The Miwoks are from northern California.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.399
They have a very rich past.

06:15.640 --> 06:19.680
We currently have on exhibition
the largest display of Indian baskets...

06:19.920 --> 06:21.639
...ever assembled
by a museum of this size.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.190
Some would say it's not responsible...

06:24.440 --> 06:26.716
...to pour money
into a dying institution.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.032
Then let's close down the libraries,
museums and symphonies.

06:30.280 --> 06:34.035
If we do not learn from our past,
we will be...

06:34.280 --> 06:36.078
<i>...doomed to relive it.</i>

06:36.320 --> 06:37.231
<i>Yes, Mort.</i>

06:37.480 --> 06:38.550
I see dinosaurs.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.555
The fear of today is that the museum
might share the same fate.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.679
That's right, Mort.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.434
<i>That is exactly the fear.</i>

06:46.680 --> 06:47.909
Very good. Thanks.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.674
It's okay, Mort.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.870
We're clear.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.592
Good.
You must've done this before.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.957
Good heavens, no. I haven't.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.955
I feel strongly about this museum.
My great-grandfather founded it.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.432
Right. I thank you for your time
and wish you all the best.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.832
Come on down from there.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.391
In the next room we have a stuffed dodo.
Come and take a look.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.791
Give me the mike.
Get some of this.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.675
One's Cretaceous, the other's Jurassic.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.559
I know.
Come on, let's go.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.192
Why are they together?

07:24.920 --> 07:26.877
Want to go outside and get B-roll?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.191
Where's the bathroom?
I'll freshen up.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.912
Get your cam ready.
I'll do a stand-up for tonight's news.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.470
Sorry.

07:39.720 --> 07:40.756
Sorry.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.718
I'm standing in front of the museum...

07:56.960 --> 07:59.953
...where the past collided
with the hardships of the present.

08:00.200 --> 08:04.797
Actually, you're standing at the urinal
at the museum and look who's here.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.394
Your friend, dick.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.199
A fine upstanding young man.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.875
No, no longer young
and no longer upstanding.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.632
<i>Tell me, dick,
what's your comment on my situation?</i>

08:15.880 --> 08:17.678
<i>Max, I think you should get packed.</i>

08:18.760 --> 08:20.160
I can't. I got screwed there.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.392
That's more than you're getting here.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.791
And as long as we're on the subject...

08:25.040 --> 08:27.271
...I kind of have a little tickle...

08:27.520 --> 08:29.910
...for that young camera girl
working for you.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.435
Really?

08:31.760 --> 08:36.073
<i>She's young enough to be my daughter.
I know it. She's just right for me.</i>

08:40.400 --> 08:41.959
You shouldn't be here.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.037
Mrs. Banks, you must listen to me.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.795
I don't have to do any such thing.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.475
- One minute.
- I told you, there's nothing I can do.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.598
I'd take a reduction, okay?

08:52.840 --> 08:53.990
Do you have a hearing problem?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.594
No, no hearing problem.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.036
This is completely out of my hands.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.275
You're wasting both of our times.
You must leave now. Now.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.836
Get out of here!

09:07.880 --> 09:09.155
Right now!

09:22.400 --> 09:23.959
Now will you listen?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.195
Will you listen?

09:26.880 --> 09:27.597
Are you?

09:27.840 --> 09:29.160
Are you going to listen to me?

09:29.480 --> 09:31.039
You must be kidding.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.073
No, I'm not.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.272
All right, hold up. Hold up.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.832
Now just stay there, okay?

09:43.080 --> 09:44.594
And hush up.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.672
And don't be scared of the gun.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.639
I got to talk to her.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.512
I need 5 minutes with you, that's all.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.192
I hope you're not pointing that at me.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.840
Just be quiet.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.715
Is this some kind of a joke?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.879
Because it won't be so funny
when the police arrive.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.636
Shut up!

10:04.400 --> 10:05.754
Give me the keys.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.750
Come on.

10:10.840 --> 10:11.876
Damn.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.230
This way.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.630
Quietly.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.991
I hope we get to see some shooting.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.280
Van two, this is Laurie.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.399
<i>Will you accept a collect call
from Max Brackett?</i>

10:48.400 --> 10:50.232
Mr. Brack-- I mean, Max?

10:50.480 --> 10:52.676
There's a man with a gun in here.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.517
Where are you?

10:54.760 --> 10:55.591
The museum.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.839
Okay, I'm going to call the police.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.833
Call Lou. We'll go live. The police
we'll call when it's their turn.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.639
I think I should call--

11:07.880 --> 11:11.271
We have some real news going on here.
Don't blow this.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.519
Okay, I'll call Lou.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.874
Lou, line 3.
It's Laurie. It's urgent.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.112
It's Brackett again.
What do you got?

11:24.920 --> 11:25.910
Gunman.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.995
He's got a rifle and a canvas bag.
I'm guessing more firepower.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.799
He's holding 2 adults and some kids.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.956
Laurie, how soon
before you can power back up?

11:36.720 --> 11:37.392
2 minutes.

11:37.640 --> 11:38.471
That's too long.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.473
Tell Dohlen to get ready to go live
with Max. He's got a hostage situation.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.792
Max, Mort's going to throw it to you.
Listen to me.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.511
There are kids involved here.
We don't want any grandstanding.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.877
Don't worry.
We got good stuff here.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.156
Keep the line open.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.436
We're live.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.437
We now go to Max Brackett, who is
inside the Museum of Natural History...

12:01.680 --> 12:03.194
...with a hostage situation.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.351
Can you hear me?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.876
<i>Yes, I can.
I am inside the men's room....</i>

12:08.040 --> 12:11.112
Mobilize every camera
and audio crew you can get.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.033
<i>Most of them are children.</i>

12:13.280 --> 12:15.317
Do you know what his motives are?

12:15.560 --> 12:18.997
I don't. But I can tell you
that the gunman does seem agitated.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.796
<i>Can you escape?</i>

12:25.480 --> 12:26.197
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

12:27.280 --> 12:29.078
Think about what you're doing.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.674
<i>Can you hear me, Max?</i>

12:31.240 --> 12:32.833
Does Jen know you're here?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.599
I don't know how much longer I can--

12:41.840 --> 12:44.150
- I want you to be calm.
- No, you be calm.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.595
I got 2 things to tell you.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.675
I'm not listening to you as long as
you're holding that stupid gun.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.316
Why should I? This is absurd.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.113
Get that stupid thing away from me!

13:04.760 --> 13:06.399
Oh, God!

13:14.160 --> 13:16.436
<i>- That was a shot, right?</i>
- Cut the feed, now.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.799
<i>Someone was hit in front of the museum.
I didn't get a good look at him.</i>

13:21.040 --> 13:22.679
What asshole pulled the plug?

13:22.920 --> 13:24.195
We're still live, Max.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.996
You did it. You did it.

13:39.120 --> 13:39.917
He's okay.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.635
He's okay.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.671
He could be dying.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.593
<i>- Listen to me.</i>
- Want him to do that on camera?

13:46.680 --> 13:49.195
They didn't pull the plug
when the <i>Challenger</i> blew up.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.515
Our viewers don't need to see the blood.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.832
We're telling them what's happening.
Mort is.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.312
<i>We've got live pictures
and you're giving them radio.</i>

13:59.680 --> 14:00.830
He's right!

14:01.080 --> 14:02.196
<i>It's the story of your career.</i>

14:02.600 --> 14:04.751
In 24 hours, this turns into a gangbang.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.789
There's 1000 people with cameras here.
If you don't record it, they will.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.430
<i>- Please don't blow this.</i>
- Go.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.636
Yeah, move.

14:13.360 --> 14:18.037
We have reestablished our live hookup
to the museum. Max, are you there?

14:18.280 --> 14:20.397
<i>Yes, Mort, I am still here.</i>

14:36.960 --> 14:38.440
<i>Sorry, the camera's not responding.</i>

14:40.240 --> 14:42.357
<i>Wait a minute, I see a figure...</i>

14:42.640 --> 14:44.677
<i>...approaching the wounded man.</i>

14:45.560 --> 14:47.040
<i>I can't make him out.</i>

14:47.760 --> 14:49.160
Why are we on TV?

14:50.280 --> 14:51.634
Oh, my God.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.199
You're bleeding.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.035
Can you walk?

14:56.280 --> 14:57.509
I don't know.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.391
I just called the ambulance.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.234
<i>That's Laurie Callahan.</i>

15:05.640 --> 15:07.313
<i>Max, how are the children?</i>

15:07.560 --> 15:10.553
<i>These kids are very frightened.
They're terrified.</i>

15:10.920 --> 15:13.196
They're together
in one corner of the lobby...

15:13.440 --> 15:15.875
...with the curator
on the floor next to them.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.713
<i>The teacher is tending to them.</i>

15:17.960 --> 15:19.474
<i>Trying to keep them calm.</i>

15:19.720 --> 15:23.919
<i>Mort, the situation has shifted
dramatically. A man has been shot.</i>

15:24.160 --> 15:28.120
<i>A line has been crossed.
We have a very dangerous situation here.</i>

15:28.400 --> 15:29.550
<i>It reminds me...</i>

15:29.800 --> 15:31.837
...two years ago....
Oh, God.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.632
We're live on the air.
Max Brackett, KXBD News.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.758
Want to tell us why you're here?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.514
You don't? Okay.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.152
- We lost him.
- What happened?

15:52.480 --> 15:53.709
Can you hear me?

15:55.240 --> 15:57.072
Max Brackett, are you there?

15:57.320 --> 15:59.073
<i>Max, are you there?</i>

16:00.280 --> 16:04.752
<i>We've lost contact momentarily with
Max Brackett, reporting from the museum.</i>

16:05.000 --> 16:06.992
This is not news, brothers and sisters.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.236
Stories like this happen every day.

16:12.480 --> 16:16.918
What we have here is news
for all time in the Word of God.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.478
I want you people out of there!
Back up! There's an armed man inside!

16:35.720 --> 16:36.756
This is dangerous!

16:37.000 --> 16:39.754
Franklin, Johnson,
I want those people off the steps now!

16:40.000 --> 16:40.990
What happened?

16:41.480 --> 16:44.757
Can you tell me who shot you?
How do you feel?

16:45.760 --> 16:49.674
Sir, can you tell us who shot you?
Are you all right?

16:51.720 --> 16:54.997
Sir, can you tell us who shot you?
One man? Two men?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.833
There's the chief!

16:57.080 --> 16:59.959
Chief Lemke, do you
have any plans yet?! Do you know--?!

17:00.280 --> 17:01.760
Do you have a statement?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.759
What are you going to do?

17:04.760 --> 17:06.638
<i>Our cameraperson has informed us...</i>

17:06.880 --> 17:09.440
<i>...that the victim's name
is Clifford Williams...</i>

17:09.680 --> 17:11.319
<i>...a security guard at the museum.</i>

17:12.480 --> 17:13.516
Mom!

17:13.760 --> 17:14.910
It's Dad.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.275
Coming up...

17:20.520 --> 17:25.231
...an unexpected role for pigeons here
in New York today at the United Nations.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.353
We'll have that story and more...

17:27.600 --> 17:28.875
...when we return.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.440
We're back in two.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.151
I heard you talking
during the broadcast. What's up?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.073
Hostage situation.

17:37.080 --> 17:37.991
Who's feeding it?

17:38.240 --> 17:40.357
It's our affiliate
in Madeline, California.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.795
Guess who the reporter is?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.756
- Who?
- Max Brackett.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.834
I knew that bastard would pop up again
with something spectacular.

17:48.080 --> 17:48.911
Absolutely.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.199
Here's the tease you're going to use
at the top of the hour.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.274
I'm not sharing a broadcast with him.
He's a loose cannon.

17:55.520 --> 18:00.117
Say, "The situation's still unfolding.
Tune in tonight for an update."

18:00.480 --> 18:04.269
I'm not saying that. I'm not
teasing a story I know nothing about.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.791
I promise them a story
and it evaporates.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.600
How does that make me look?
How does that make the network look?

18:09.840 --> 18:10.591
It's from above.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.991
We're back in 30.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.517
Goddamn foolishness just because
somebody thinks this is a good lead-in.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.077
With Brackett, it won't evaporate.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.236
Kevin...

18:25.480 --> 18:27.517
...it's a guy getting shot...

18:27.760 --> 18:29.319
...bunch of kids taken hostage.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.040
It's good television.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.680
And no other net has it.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.958
The man can't be trusted.
I'm not broadcasting...

18:36.200 --> 18:38.476
...with that crazy son of a bitch.
Remember what he did?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.791
It was before the beginning of time.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.032
5 and 4, 3....

18:46.960 --> 18:49.429
Call Madeline.
Find out how Brackett got there.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.911
I want to know
what the hell he's doing there.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.029
<i>Now that the gunman has shown
a willingness to use firepower....</i>

18:57.280 --> 18:58.634
It was an accident, moron.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.509
- Boys!
- It's broken.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.673
I just want my job back.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.951
Now look at this.
Look at this!

19:13.280 --> 19:16.432
Look at this!
I'm never going to get my job back now.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.991
Everybody knows who I am,
where I--

19:24.600 --> 19:27.718
Your fault. Everyone knows where I am
because of you.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.391
Everyone knows you're here
because you shot someone.

19:30.640 --> 19:31.960
Shut up, newsboy.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.558
You really did this
to get your job back?

19:36.520 --> 19:37.795
What do you think?

19:40.160 --> 19:41.594
That's for you.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.997
If you make contact...

19:48.440 --> 19:52.832
...tell them everyone is okay in here.
You'll buy yourself some time.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.754
I'll tell them they better back off
because I will shoot someone.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.595
This first one will be you.
I'll throw your body out the front door.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.274
I wouldn't do that.

20:02.760 --> 20:03.557
Why not?

20:03.800 --> 20:08.272
That'll just make everybody jumpy. They
might do something we'll all regret.

20:10.920 --> 20:14.709
Remember that hostage situation
in Torrance about 2 years ago?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.838
Yeah, car dealership.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.959
4 people died.
One was the gunman.

20:19.200 --> 20:19.997
Shut up.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.277
I was there.
I covered that story.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.551
This is Chief Alvin Lemke.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.554
Am I speaking to the man responsible
for this situation?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.760
Yep, you are.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.833
Could I have your name, please?

20:38.560 --> 20:39.437
No.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.714
How's that guy? Cliff?
Is he all right?

20:44.960 --> 20:48.078
No, he's in the hospital!
May I have your name, please?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.080
Listen...

20:50.680 --> 20:53.559
...you must know I didn't mean
to shoot him. That was an accident.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.598
That's good.
That's a good thing.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.719
We will take that into account
if you give up now.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.510
No.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.751
- I don't think so.
- No, he's a killer.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.713
I don't think I can do that.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.352
<i>What do you want?
What are your demands?</i>

21:10.600 --> 21:11.317
My what?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.233
What do you want?

21:15.280 --> 21:16.509
Hold on.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.920
He said, "What are my demands?"

21:21.600 --> 21:22.431
Tell him.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.911
I don't have any.
I didn't plan on this.

21:26.240 --> 21:30.314
I don't wish to appear hostile,
but you're making my job difficult.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.673
Tell them that you'll talk
when you're good and ready.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.877
And no bodies out the front door.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.076
Right.

21:39.040 --> 21:43.353
I want everybody to back off and I'm
going to talk when I'm good and ready.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.838
Hello?
He hung up.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.436
How was that?

21:48.760 --> 21:49.989
Sounded good to me.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.311
That was good.
That was good.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.799
Why don't you sit down?

22:01.040 --> 22:02.235
Just sit down.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.430
All right now...

22:06.680 --> 22:08.114
...what's next?

22:08.640 --> 22:11.030
You give up
or you get yourself some demands.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.637
- Like what?
- Money.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.078
- Ransom.
- No, I can't take money I didn't earn.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.310
I want my job back.

22:18.560 --> 22:23.157
No, you got to ask for a fast car,
or a Lear jet or a Greyhound bus.

22:23.400 --> 22:26.837
You have to have a valid demand
or you'll make them nervous.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.037
I came here to get my job back.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.509
Why did you bring a gun?

22:30.760 --> 22:32.274
- I want her to listen!
- Who?

22:32.520 --> 22:33.397
Mrs. Banks!

22:35.200 --> 22:36.395
Look...

22:36.640 --> 22:40.270
...I can't go out there.
If I do, I'll be put in prison.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.671
I can't take care of my family
in prison.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.957
There's different ways of giving up.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.910
What?

22:47.160 --> 22:49.311
- Which way?
- Can I show you something?

22:49.560 --> 22:51.279
Here.
No, that's dangerous.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.513
You got another window in this place?
Now, listen.

22:55.200 --> 22:55.951
Slowly.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.475
Slowly.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.870
- Have you ever been arrested?
- No.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.600
That's very good.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.240
American bald eagle.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.555
I want you to look at this.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.036
See those people?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.390
Not the cops, not the news media.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.313
I want you to look. Go on.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.437
See?

23:17.680 --> 23:18.909
The people.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.639
- That's public opinion.
- I guess so.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.271
That's a powerful force.
You got a problem right now.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.520
Those people hate your guts.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.829
You're holding kids hostage
and that's a no-no.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.912
At best, they think you're nuts.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.230
But I'm not.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.951
I mean, not usually.
Jenny tells me I don't think.

23:41.000 --> 23:41.911
Who's Jenny?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.311
- My wife.
- And you're--?

23:45.800 --> 23:46.711
"Sam."

23:48.360 --> 23:50.397
I don't think you're crazy.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.235
You're just an ordinary guy
who's popped his top.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.756
But you must connect
with those people out there.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.517
They know what it's like to lose their
job, or they know someone who has.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.834
They'll understand
if you give them a chance.

24:05.320 --> 24:08.757
The one thing you might want to do
before you give yourself up...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.993
...is let those people know
what you're about.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.397
How?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.554
If I put a camera on you right now
and I interview you...

24:16.800 --> 24:20.680
...and you tell people what's going on,
I think they'll want to know.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.349
Don't you?

24:23.720 --> 24:24.870
No.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.633
That's your jury pool out there.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.110
All right.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.957
Exchange the kids for the interview.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.156
No.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.279
You help them, they help you.

24:42.080 --> 24:42.957
One.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.600
One, that's it.

24:44.840 --> 24:45.830
One's good.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.320
No, I can't do that. I can't put
a hostage-taker on television.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.357
<i>I understand.</i>

24:54.600 --> 24:57.434
He's insisting
that I put him on right now.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.120
"As a good faith gesture,
I will let one child go.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.478
Once Mr. Brackett has put me on TV,
I will...

25:06.720 --> 25:08.677
...I will consider
releasing the others."

25:08.920 --> 25:11.071
No, you let everybody go first.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.231
Hold on.

25:12.480 --> 25:16.440
- He said let everybody go first.
- He can't negotiate with your emotions.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.114
Unacceptable!

25:20.480 --> 25:22.711
Don't negotiate my emotions.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.920
Hello Sheriff Lemke, Max Brackett.
I know the rules about these things--

25:27.160 --> 25:29.038
Is he listening to us?

25:29.280 --> 25:31.875
- No, sir, he's not.
- Is he pointing his weapon at you?

25:32.120 --> 25:37.275
I can guarantee Mr. Baily's sincere. I
think that things'll become unstable...

25:37.520 --> 25:39.034
<i>...if you don't grant him this.</i>

25:39.280 --> 25:40.270
Jesus!

25:41.080 --> 25:42.150
I don't like this.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.357
- I know you don't.
- Tell him I'm upset.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.671
But this man is very upset, sir.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.998
Things are very unpredictable here.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.034
All right, look....

25:54.640 --> 25:57.394
Okay, but I want this over quickly,
understand?

26:00.640 --> 26:01.710
Someone.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.279
That's all you're going to get.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.120
They'll want to know what's in the bag.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.431
Nothing.

26:12.680 --> 26:13.591
May I look?

26:17.920 --> 26:19.240
Oh, man!

26:21.040 --> 26:25.034
My brother-in-law uses it
to clear stumps away on his farm.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.350
Why'd you bring it?

26:26.600 --> 26:29.559
Because I wanted
Mrs. Banks to believe I was serious.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.473
The gun's not enough?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.912
I wanted to impress her!

26:35.760 --> 26:37.592
What are you going to do with it?

26:37.920 --> 26:39.400
I just want to go home.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.711
You don't need it anymore.
I'll take it.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.237
Now, go. Now, just go.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.520
How do I know you're coming back?

26:50.200 --> 26:52.510
Because you're the best show in town.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.360
Wait a minute.
Wait!

26:54.600 --> 26:55.511
Come here.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.871
I need to ask you something.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.040
I need you to talk to my wife, okay?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.196
Because when she finds out about this...

27:05.440 --> 27:07.750
...she's going to be upset big-time.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.032
The press will be all over her.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.634
Oh, man!

27:12.280 --> 27:15.478
That's okay. Want me to fix it
so I'm the only one who talks to her?

27:15.920 --> 27:16.751
- Only me?
- Just you.

27:17.000 --> 27:17.990
You got it.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.949
You watch yourself.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.430
Chief!

27:29.080 --> 27:30.480
Stay here.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.876
Mr. Brackett,
are the children all right?!

27:43.120 --> 27:45.476
Go get your camera.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.791
- How are the kids?
- The kids are fine.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.030
What's the story?

27:49.280 --> 27:53.752
The story is he has enough dynamite to
level the place, so don't piss him off.

27:54.000 --> 27:54.751
Jesus!

27:55.000 --> 27:55.831
Excuse me.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.553
I'm Mr. Brackett's assistant.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.677
Come here.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.910
Don't get cocky.

28:01.160 --> 28:04.392
You want to make your TV show,
then you cooperate with me.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.994
You scratch my back....

28:06.240 --> 28:10.393
Notice all the cameras are on my back
and your face is on the channels.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.758
When I go in front of the camera,
I'll say you're in charge.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.992
- May I go now?
- What's his name?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.356
Sam Baily.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.716
Please?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.394
- You may go.
- You're hitting a pressure point.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.314
- I know I am.
- I got the parents right over here.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.520
Can you tell us
what's going on in there?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.951
I just want to say
that your children are fine.

28:32.200 --> 28:36.877
We're doing everything we can to resolve
the situation as soon as possible.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.797
You won't believe this,
but your kids are playing inside.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.556
When will it end?

28:42.800 --> 28:46.191
The police don't have any control
so some news guy's running things?

28:46.440 --> 28:48.079
I'm not running anything.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.115
What would happen
if I decided to get my kid?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.714
That wouldn't be a good idea.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.396
That's right.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.553
You'd put everyone's kids in danger.
Mister Mayor.

28:58.240 --> 29:02.075
Cochran and I are doing everything to
make sure your kids are home for dinner.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.916
Don't talk to the press.
Network orders. We're going national.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.276
What's going on?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.273
Sorry, we've been promoted.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.319
<i>You'll have to turn on the news
when I report it.</i>

29:13.560 --> 29:14.755
<i>We go now to Max Brackett...</i>

29:15.000 --> 29:18.710
<i>...for an exclusive report
on the situation in the museum.</i>

29:19.040 --> 29:23.671
It's good to see you safe.
This is a remarkable job you're doing.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.071
<i>Thank you, Mort.
I was just....</i>

29:26.360 --> 29:29.751
<i>I'm just happy I was in a position
to help the children.</i>

29:30.000 --> 29:31.639
<i>I'm optimistic that Mr. Baily--</i>

29:31.880 --> 29:35.669
Should we bring Broyles down from
San Francisco if this takes hold?

29:36.640 --> 29:38.552
We can ask, but what for?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.639
Brackett was born for this job.

29:40.880 --> 29:41.757
Look at him.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.635
He's a pig in shit.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.714
Kevin, anyone ever feel him out
for anchor work?

29:46.960 --> 29:48.155
That's an anchor?!

29:48.960 --> 29:50.030
Look at him.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.077
I wouldn't even
buy a new car from that guy.

29:53.320 --> 29:57.200
He'd never sit behind a desk. He wanted
to be where the bullets were flying.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.672
Then he got too hot to keep around
after your little incident.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.600
Little incident?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.519
Are we suffering from memory loss?

30:05.120 --> 30:07.077
He did his two years in the sticks.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.789
He learned his lesson.
He chilled.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.477
<i>Max, we understand you are going back
inside the museum.</i>

30:14.720 --> 30:17.599
<i>Yes. Mr. Baily has agreed
to release one child.</i>

30:18.240 --> 30:20.800
What about that girl in the glasses?

30:21.080 --> 30:23.959
- You're asking me?
- I got to choose somebody.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.358
- Do you have children?
- I have two.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.235
- Could you bear saving just one?
- Quiet.

30:31.680 --> 30:35.515
Let all of them go. That's how you'll
get people to sympathize with you.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.431
Everybody's going to get to go home.
You just got to take turns.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.799
<i>I would like to say I stand by to offer
whatever help I can give, and hope...</i>

30:46.040 --> 30:49.750
...there will be a peaceful resolution,
without further violence.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.994
<i>Be careful, Max...</i>

30:52.280 --> 30:53.236
<i>...and Godspeed.</i>

30:53.480 --> 30:55.392
Thank you. Godspeed.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.280
- We're clear.
- Mort has Shakespeare writing for him.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.749
We were number one.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.877
What happened with the guard?

31:01.280 --> 31:02.953
What do you mean?

31:03.200 --> 31:04.953
You left the camera
and went to help him.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.237
He was hurt.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.836
Why didn't you take the camera
if you're going to be so humane?

31:11.720 --> 31:12.756
Because I can't--

31:13.000 --> 31:15.799
I can't hold a camera
and help someone at the same time.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.599
By not having your camera...

31:17.840 --> 31:20.833
...we lost footage
nobody else would have had.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.471
You must decide whether you are
going to be part of a story...

31:24.720 --> 31:26.279
...or record the story.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.159
Max, it's Lou.

31:28.600 --> 31:32.150
I want you with me
from the start to the end of the story.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.999
Hi, Lou.
You having fun?

31:36.240 --> 31:39.631
I send you out for some fluff and
you come back with a hostage situation.

31:39.880 --> 31:43.669
I guess I'm just not
one of your fluffy kind of reporters.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.994
He's an average guy. He's married.
He's got kids. He flipped.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.799
And now he's the Terminator.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.030
<i>What does he want?</i>

31:50.280 --> 31:53.000
Wants his job back. Wants to be heard.
A little dignity.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.994
And we're stuck in the middle.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.596
<i>It's a good place to be.
If you're uncomfortable with it...</i>

31:57.960 --> 31:59.679
...we don't have a contract.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.640
- I can go to another channel.
<i>- The network called.</i>

32:02.880 --> 32:05.349
Looks like
you're back in the big saddle.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.560
There's nothing like old friends.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.916
Look at this jerk.
What a showboat!

32:34.200 --> 32:35.316
Zoom in.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.038
It's a military helicopter!

32:53.120 --> 32:54.918
Which one gets to leave?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.957
I was thinking of that girl
in the glasses.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.156
Which one?

33:00.480 --> 33:01.630
That one.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.155
Let's give them two.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.596
- No, I said one.
- You shot a black man.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.036
Some people
are going to make an issue of that.

33:08.280 --> 33:12.160
Show kindness to a black, it's harder
to play the race card against you.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.395
You understand?

33:14.640 --> 33:16.472
Two kids are being released!

33:16.800 --> 33:18.234
Hurry up!

33:23.920 --> 33:25.593
All right, what happened?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.958
Did he treat you okay?!
Let them say something!

33:31.200 --> 33:33.431
Right next to the man.
There she is.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.433
Maybe I'll see my mom.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.080
I hope I see my mom.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.037
Look!

33:38.280 --> 33:39.634
A bigger one.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.875
I came in. I don't know,
I was twenty minutes late and....

33:45.560 --> 33:49.270
You see, the night before
we had a softball game. We won.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.513
I had a double and a triple.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.478
So we were happy. We had a party
and I had, I don't know...

33:56.720 --> 33:58.712
...three beers,
something like that.

33:58.960 --> 34:03.477
The next day I came into work
and Mrs. Banks told me to come in--

34:03.720 --> 34:06.280
Leave out the part about the ball game,
and the drinks.

34:06.520 --> 34:11.197
- Yeah, but we drank. I mean, I drank.
- Sure, but that's not why you got fired.

34:11.560 --> 34:15.270
Let's not give them that impression.
Start from "Mrs. Banks...."

34:15.520 --> 34:19.958
Mrs. Banks-- See, she didn't ask me.
She tells you what to do, okay?

34:20.200 --> 34:24.513
It's like those dinosaurs.
Her great-granddaddy made, I mean...

34:24.760 --> 34:27.514
...he just put them there
and that's enough for her.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.877
I have no clue
as to what you're talking about.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.272
- She does.
- We can leave out the dinosaurs.

34:33.640 --> 34:34.630
Mrs. Banks said....

34:34.880 --> 34:36.997
"We have two security guards...

34:37.240 --> 34:40.119
...we don't need them
because we must cut back on money.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.432
We only need one. So Cliff,
who's been around here longer...

34:43.680 --> 34:45.080
...and he, you know...."

34:45.320 --> 34:49.599
So I said, "All right, fine. I'll take
less money or I'll take less hours."

34:50.360 --> 34:51.396
She didn't listen.

34:51.640 --> 34:55.270
Did it ever occur to you
that I might deal with problems...

34:55.520 --> 34:57.557
...bigger than your personal economics?

34:57.800 --> 35:01.430
That my job is running the museum,
not my employee's careers?

35:01.680 --> 35:03.797
I came to you twice, you didn't see--

35:04.040 --> 35:05.315
I couldn't at that moment.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.837
Well, don't turn around.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.153
You only want things your way.

35:11.600 --> 35:15.037
Walk over there and make sure
the buffalo are grazing properly.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.316
Bison.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.471
I stand corrected.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.120
Let me ask you something.

35:19.360 --> 35:23.195
Is this the first time you came
to see her? Today? Mrs. Banks?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.591
No. The second time.

35:25.840 --> 35:26.830
The second time.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.278
I want you to tell me what
you were feeling when she fired you.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.394
- This will sound stupid but....
- Go ahead.

35:35.720 --> 35:39.509
You know that thing in a car
that measures miles?

35:39.760 --> 35:42.639
- The meter.
- It goes back to zero.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.678
That's what was going on in my mind.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.640
I couldn't tell my wife.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.750
You couldn't tell her you were fired?

35:51.000 --> 35:55.233
Then I'd get dressed for work every day,
like a fool, and...

35:55.480 --> 35:58.632
...I'd just go to some movie theater
and just spend the day...

35:58.880 --> 36:00.872
...sitting, eating popcorn, thinking.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.919
And today, when you came here,
what did you want?

36:04.160 --> 36:05.753
I just wanted her to listen.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.754
Did you want to hurt her?

36:09.160 --> 36:10.389
Not really.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.275
Why would you grab a gun and explosives
if you didn't want to hurt her?

36:19.840 --> 36:20.751
I don't know.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.229
You have to know.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.792
Sam, this is critical.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.477
When you grabbed that gun,
what went on in your head?

36:31.160 --> 36:32.719
I thought about my babies.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.997
That's a good point.
What about them?

36:35.240 --> 36:39.553
You see, if I lose my job,
I lose my house and my benefits...

36:39.800 --> 36:42.599
...and I can't take care of them
if I lose my benefits.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.392
I'm in front of Sam Baily's house,
and I'm joined by his best friend...

36:47.640 --> 36:49.279
...Travis Bartholomew.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.430
That's right. I know Sam well.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.034
<i>We go fishing and stuff.</i>

36:54.280 --> 36:57.079
<i>So, what's he like?
Is he weird or what?</i>

36:58.600 --> 36:59.511
Who is he?

37:00.280 --> 37:01.430
Who is this guy?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.558
<i>You could say he's pretty weird.</i>

37:03.880 --> 37:05.439
<i>Does he have a temper?</i>

37:05.920 --> 37:07.149
<i>Temper?</i>

37:07.560 --> 37:10.200
If we could talk to a few of them....

37:12.000 --> 37:14.879
Mr. Brackett said that
we were only to talk just to him.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.879
He says it's better for Sam.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.395
<i>Dangerous, yeah.</i>

37:18.640 --> 37:19.676
Dangerous.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.240
Whatever, you know?

37:21.640 --> 37:24.474
You heard it
from the best friend of Sam Baily.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.870
Thank you very much.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.430
How could Sam do this to us?

37:28.680 --> 37:29.557
How could he?

37:29.800 --> 37:33.760
There appears to be activity
in the house. Let's get a statement.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.514
They're standing in my flowers!

37:35.760 --> 37:36.796
That does it!

37:37.040 --> 37:38.235
That does it!

37:39.160 --> 37:43.234
Would you get out of my flowers?
Do not stand in my flowers!

37:45.480 --> 37:49.633
Has your husband been in contact
with you? Can we get a statement?

37:50.760 --> 37:55.391
I'm here. Jackson is with the victim's
wife. I'm being completely blocked out.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.678
- Ready?
- Anytime.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.636
Roll.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.953
Your husband was kept on at the museum.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.034
The man who was let go, a white man,
came back and shot him.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.749
Do you feel
race had anything to do with that?

38:16.200 --> 38:18.032
Cliff and Sam were friends.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.000
Sam didn't blame Cliff
for what happened.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.436
At least, I don't think he did.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.833
Christ, I'm going to hate this.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.309
Chief, showtime.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.676
Here we go.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.954
It's about to start.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.437
<i>We take you now, live,
inside the Museum of Natural History...</i>

38:45.680 --> 38:47.000
<i>...to meet the hostage-taker.</i>

38:49.640 --> 38:51.791
We now bring you an exclusive report.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.555
Max Brackett is inside the siege.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.836
Key in the graphic.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.470
<i>You are Sam Baily
and you're a loving husband...</i>

38:58.720 --> 39:00.916
...and a devoted father of two.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.278
You've got a mortgage,
car payments, medical bills...

39:04.520 --> 39:09.231
...food bills, electricity bills,
gas bills, clothing bills...

39:10.080 --> 39:11.514
...and, by the way...

39:11.880 --> 39:13.075
...you're fired.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.274
I just want to say that I'm....

39:23.520 --> 39:25.432
I didn't mean to shoot that guy, Cliff.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.353
That was an accident.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.234
And....

39:32.320 --> 39:34.755
I used to complain about my paycheck.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.314
And then when...

39:37.560 --> 39:39.358
...when I didn't get it no more...

39:39.680 --> 39:42.354
...I realized that was the last....

39:42.600 --> 39:45.752
That little piece of paper
was the only thing...

39:46.000 --> 39:47.559
...holding my life together.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.320
And....

39:50.080 --> 39:51.400
You know, when I seen...

39:51.800 --> 39:54.599
...I seen
people out on the street living...

39:54.840 --> 39:56.513
...and...

39:57.240 --> 39:58.117
...I thought...

39:58.360 --> 40:01.797
<i>...they were maybe
like bums or like junkies.</i>

40:02.560 --> 40:04.392
<i>And then one day...</i>

40:04.640 --> 40:06.359
<i>...I seen this family live....</i>

40:06.760 --> 40:09.229
<i>I seen this family living in a box
and...</i>

40:10.080 --> 40:13.517
...I imagined my babies living
in that box and I couldn't stand it.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.160
I went crazy.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.349
And...

40:18.720 --> 40:20.120
...about the gun....

40:20.360 --> 40:23.512
<i>It's just a Remington gun.
It ain't nothing, really.</i>

40:23.760 --> 40:26.719
<i>It's just....
I've seen on TV shows...</i>

40:26.960 --> 40:30.840
...where they flash a gun
and it gets them attention.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.879
I thought
maybe if I brought the gun in...

40:34.120 --> 40:36.999
...that Mrs. Banks,
who's my boss...

40:37.240 --> 40:38.879
...she would...

40:39.120 --> 40:43.478
...she would listen, you know,
for maybe just even five minutes.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.919
You know, but...

40:47.200 --> 40:50.272
...I don't know
if people listen to guys like me.

40:50.520 --> 40:55.231
<i>I'm just a guy that has a job, goes to
work everyday and people don't listen.</i>

40:55.560 --> 40:58.598
We're a good family.
We don't do drugs...

40:58.840 --> 41:00.991
...and we don't cause trouble.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.356
We go to church.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.557
I go to church too,
with my family.

41:04.800 --> 41:08.635
But I don't think anybody listens
to someone like me.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.520
<i>I don't think anybody cares
about someone like us.</i>

41:11.760 --> 41:13.558
This guy shot a man in cold blood...

41:13.800 --> 41:16.634
...and I feel like bringing him home
for Christmas dinner.

41:17.440 --> 41:20.319
Let's run a nationwide poll
and see how this guy is playing.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.320
I don't know if anybody's listening.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.277
Are they?

41:27.520 --> 41:28.715
Your name is Sam Baily...

41:28.960 --> 41:30.838
...and the law is pushing in on you.

41:31.080 --> 41:35.279
Because of one impulsive act, you're
trapped in the fight of your life.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.920
Your sole demand, Sam...

41:37.160 --> 41:39.675
...is simple
to the point of absurdity...

41:39.920 --> 41:42.196
...and yet dauntingly complex,
isn't it?

41:42.600 --> 41:44.319
I just want the police to--

41:44.680 --> 41:47.593
I just want everybody
to forget about it...

41:47.840 --> 41:49.115
<i>...and let me go home.</i>

41:49.960 --> 41:51.360
Yeah, right.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.278
<i>I feel so bad about what I did to Cliff.
He's my friend.</i>

41:58.640 --> 42:00.711
<i>I'm praying for him.</i>

42:01.640 --> 42:04.155
<i>And I know when he feels better,
he'll forgive me.</i>

42:04.400 --> 42:05.880
I'm sorry, Cliff.

42:08.880 --> 42:12.112
The kids, you know, they're fine.
They're happy.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.316
Look.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.234
They're okay.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.077
Look, we're on TV!

42:20.960 --> 42:22.360
Kids, please sit down.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.115
The kids,
they're seeing themselves on TV.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.915
Start over right now about the kids.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.389
Talk about the kids.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.234
I'd never hurt them.
I would never hurt them.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.279
I got kids of my own.

42:38.760 --> 42:43.357
I just don't have a job to take care
of them. I don't know how I will.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.593
<i>But I just want to say I'm sorry.
I couldn't be sorrier.</i>

42:49.120 --> 42:51.840
- That's my daddy.
- Phillip, come back here.

42:52.280 --> 42:53.475
Come here.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.312
Mommy wants to watch Daddy.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.638
I just want to go home, okay?
Just....

43:04.000 --> 43:04.956
I want to go.

43:05.200 --> 43:08.955
And that's my demand.
That's it, right there.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.116
Hey, wait.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.874
Sam, wait.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.271
I hope I don't have to
go through that again.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.949
We're not finished yet.
You know why?

43:21.200 --> 43:25.479
Because people watching this right now
are saying, "Yeah, right.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.315
This guy's holding a gun
on a bunch of helpless kids--"

43:28.560 --> 43:32.156
I ain't holding no gun
on no helpless kids! They're okay.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.313
They think you are.
And they think you should be shot...

43:35.560 --> 43:36.596
...executed...

43:36.840 --> 43:37.910
...strung up.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.719
For the people who are saying this,
what do you have to say to them?

43:42.960 --> 43:44.952
I hope you never go through this.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.759
You say it to them.

43:49.520 --> 43:54.231
I hope nobody ever has to go through
what I'm going through now, that's all.

43:56.920 --> 43:58.957
Your name is Sam Baily...

43:59.200 --> 44:02.079
...and you're asking
for the most poignant ransom of all:

44:02.320 --> 44:03.595
Forgiveness.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.600
And while we all have it
in our hearts to give...

44:06.920 --> 44:07.751
...we're not the law.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.196
Why'd you bring up that shotgun stuff?

44:10.440 --> 44:13.831
<i>Reporting exclusively for KXBD News,
I'm Max Brackett.</i>

44:14.480 --> 44:16.949
We're clear.
I thought it was great.

44:17.960 --> 44:21.431
- Why'd you bring up the shotgun?
- It was for your own benefit.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.909
It didn't seem like it.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.719
Believe me, it was important.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.314
All right, now what?

44:28.560 --> 44:29.789
Now what?

44:31.720 --> 44:32.915
Now we wait.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.513
Take a look out there.

44:47.760 --> 44:48.750
Is anybody listening?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.275
<i>Is anybody listening</i>

44:50.520 --> 44:51.795
Careful.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.229
See what I mean?

44:57.240 --> 44:59.152
- What do you got?
- Baily's all over the place.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.232
Television, radio, newspapers.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.995
Take a look
at the front page of the Times.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.874
Turn the radio up a little.

45:09.120 --> 45:12.796
<i>This guy has never broken a law
in his life. He is under pressure.</i>

45:13.040 --> 45:16.954
<i>We can all understand,
and so I think we should let him walk.</i>

45:17.280 --> 45:19.636
The situation's a shame, isn't it?

45:20.120 --> 45:22.237
Man takes children hostage....

45:23.520 --> 45:26.433
This is America.
It can make you crazy.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.077
Hollander arrived the next morning and--

45:29.440 --> 45:32.911
You'll see why Hollander
still hates Brackett's guts.

45:33.480 --> 45:34.675
They were live.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.593
<i>What's it like out there?</i>

45:36.840 --> 45:38.513
<i>It's basically a mess.</i>

45:38.760 --> 45:40.797
<i>There's a kind of a....</i>

45:41.480 --> 45:44.791
<i>The wreckage is spread over a wide area.
I don't know how many acres.</i>

45:45.040 --> 45:47.157
<i>- Any bodies?
- Yes, there are.</i>

45:47.400 --> 45:49.596
<i>What condition are they in?</i>

45:49.840 --> 45:51.115
<i>Condition?</i>

45:52.120 --> 45:54.476
<i>- Condition?
- Were they mutilated?</i>

45:54.880 --> 45:57.714
<i>See, we're still looking for survivors
and we're hoping....</i>

45:57.960 --> 45:59.280
<i>Were they--?</i>

45:59.520 --> 46:02.479
<i>Did they suffer any trauma?
Were they broken up in any way?</i>

46:02.720 --> 46:04.359
<i>They fell out of the sky.</i>

46:05.000 --> 46:06.719
<i>Were there any body parts?</i>

46:06.960 --> 46:09.998
<i>You're asking me if I saw body parts?
You want me to report--?</i>

46:10.240 --> 46:11.993
<i>I don't mean to be grim....</i>

46:12.240 --> 46:14.914
<i>But I understand there were reports,
sharks in the area.</i>

46:15.160 --> 46:18.631
<i>I didn't see any sharks.
But don't let the fact that the...</i>

46:19.040 --> 46:21.714
<i>...family of the victims
are probably watching the show...</i>

46:21.960 --> 46:24.031
<i>...I don't want that to stop you.</i>

46:24.160 --> 46:26.117
<i>- You've had a tough night.
- No, I feel great.</i>

46:26.360 --> 46:30.036
<i>This is the best story in the year
for me, and probably for you.</i>

46:30.280 --> 46:32.556
<i>If you can see
all the vultures out there...</i>

46:32.800 --> 46:36.555
<i>...that have flocked to the seashore
to see these collective body parts.</i>

46:36.800 --> 46:39.315
<i>If you want a body part,
I'll get a gaff--</i>

46:39.560 --> 46:41.040
<i>What do you want?</i>

46:41.280 --> 46:43.670
<i>An arm or a leg?
You can have your pick.</i>

46:43.920 --> 46:45.354
That went out over the air?

46:45.600 --> 46:46.795
<i>Why don't you have a seat?</i>

46:47.040 --> 46:48.110
All of it.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.480
It'd be interesting
to see them together again.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.960
I thought of that.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.989
One here, one there.
It'd be good for 2 or 3 points.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.310
At least.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.718
I want to show you something.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.314
It's going to be a tough sell.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.789
Not for me.

47:09.200 --> 47:09.951
Good morning.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.157
- How are you?
- Just great.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.871
59% of the American people are showing
compassion for an armed felon.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.430
He asks for forgiveness
and everyone says, "Sure."

47:21.680 --> 47:23.080
This is a fascinating story.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.276
What do we do?

47:24.520 --> 47:25.920
We're covering it, Kevin.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.231
Brackett's interview was brilliant.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.518
Unless you want to double-team it?
You and Brackett.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.592
I'm not sharing my time with him.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.514
I'm getting on a plane
and will cover the story from there.

47:38.640 --> 47:39.835
It could be over by tomorrow.

47:40.080 --> 47:42.276
No, Brackett won't let it be over.

47:43.880 --> 47:46.873
This has the potential
to be a huge story.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.839
We must jump all over this.

47:49.080 --> 47:53.359
The guy's a poster child
for the disenfranchised. Why? How?

47:53.600 --> 47:54.556
It's good television.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.792
- No other net has it.
- It's a great story.

47:57.040 --> 47:57.837
What about Brackett?

47:58.840 --> 48:00.274
I'll take care of Brackett.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.515
Special Agent Dobbins, FBI.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.433
The situation is stable, sir.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.878
We have televisions in Washington.
We know the situation.

48:31.120 --> 48:33.191
Every time I scratch my ass,
it's on TV.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.274
I'll drive.
Have the militias arrived yet?

48:38.160 --> 48:40.959
No. At least I don't think so.

49:11.400 --> 49:14.677
I was across the street all night.
How'd you do this?

49:14.920 --> 49:16.149
We're very sneaky.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.517
- I guess.
- This way, sir.

49:18.760 --> 49:21.719
What's the plan?
I'm under pressure to do something.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.112
We don't move
until we get public opinion on our side.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.192
People are beginning to like him.

49:27.440 --> 49:28.760
Wire him, please.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.400
That'll change.

49:32.040 --> 49:35.351
They'll get bored or he'll do something
to make them turn on him.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.035
By then we'll be in a position
to take him out.

49:39.600 --> 49:41.637
Anything I should be afraid of saying?

49:41.880 --> 49:45.794
Get in front of the cameras and say
we're waiting as long as it takes.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.635
We're not about to play games
when kids are involved.

49:48.880 --> 49:49.870
Good.

50:12.760 --> 50:13.750
I got shots!

50:14.680 --> 50:15.875
Must be his shotgun.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.636
What's going on?

50:20.920 --> 50:22.559
- What?
- Calm down.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.314
The phone--

50:26.440 --> 50:28.272
What was that?
What's that about?

50:28.520 --> 50:30.989
Just forget it, all right?
Don't worry about it.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.833
<i>Don't worry?
Was anyone hurt?</i>

50:33.080 --> 50:35.879
Nobody's been hurt.
It was just an accident.

50:36.120 --> 50:38.351
The phone rang and the gun went off
and that was it.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.877
You can't shoot and not expect me
to not storm the place.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.440
You don't want that.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.194
<i>We had a deal, right?</i>

50:45.440 --> 50:46.715
Are you taping?

50:47.480 --> 50:50.314
We kept up our end of the bargain.
Now it's time to end this.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.711
What about my end of the bargain?

50:52.960 --> 50:55.839
The demand?
Do we get to forget about all this?

50:56.080 --> 50:58.515
Sam, I can't let you go.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.150
You won't be allowed
to walk away from this.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.471
<i>The only option you have is to give up.</i>

51:05.040 --> 51:08.750
I'm going to make the options now.
You better come up with something else.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.400
Take the shells out of the gun.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.040
The plan didn't work, newsboy.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.316
Did you hear me?

51:15.160 --> 51:16.230
What are those?

51:16.520 --> 51:19.115
In the Air Force, I did night duty
and didn't fall asleep once.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.795
- Can I see them?
- It's just caffeine.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.713
You don't want to lose control.

51:23.960 --> 51:28.113
I'm sorry about that, okay?
I didn't mean to scare you kids, okay?

51:28.360 --> 51:29.350
I'm not scared.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.159
You guys sleep good?

51:31.400 --> 51:32.959
- Not really.
- Sort of.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.431
I guess.
Now I'm kind of hungry.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.830
You're hungry?

51:37.600 --> 51:40.274
Sam, you got to let them go now.

51:40.520 --> 51:41.590
Follow me!

51:42.840 --> 51:43.956
Where're you going?

51:44.200 --> 51:45.475
Let's go, quickly.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.671
Look at all the animals.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.798
Now what's the magic word?

51:57.760 --> 51:59.319
Open Sesame?

51:59.560 --> 52:00.437
Good guess.

52:05.520 --> 52:06.397
What do you want?

52:06.640 --> 52:09.200
- Nice, huh?
- Whose side are you on, Mr. Brackett?

52:09.440 --> 52:10.590
The good guys'.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.000
Doesn't look that way.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.594
Sam needs all the help he can get.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.752
Oh, you're so concerned about Sam?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.674
Yes. You're looking at the difference
between 1 and 10 years in prison.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.879
Is that because this insanity
benefits your career?

52:23.120 --> 52:25.191
I hope so.
It benefits yours as well.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.077
What?

52:27.320 --> 52:30.199
You're running the most famous
little museum in the country.

52:30.440 --> 52:34.195
You'll have dodos
and dinosaur bones up the wazoo.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.676
You can have a lot.
You can have two.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.276
T-shirts, right here.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.474
Sam's T-shirts!

52:46.720 --> 52:51.317
We're providing Americans what they
were denied at Ruby Ridge and Waco:

52:51.560 --> 52:55.315
Witnesses to the actions of the
so-called law enforcement establishment.

52:55.560 --> 52:59.190
But you agree with the calling for
the peaceful surrender of Sam Baily?

52:59.440 --> 53:00.954
Is that a trick question?

53:02.200 --> 53:06.114
<i>Of course we don't approve
of his putting children in harm's way.</i>

53:06.360 --> 53:07.953
- They're here.
<i>- I know that.</i>

53:08.200 --> 53:09.600
Keep an eye on them.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.240
<i>A family man
put out of work by racial quotas.</i>

53:13.480 --> 53:15.199
<i>What do you plan on doing?</i>

53:15.640 --> 53:16.790
What's he trying to say?

53:17.240 --> 53:20.677
They fired you. They kept Cliff.
You shot Cliff. He's black.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.832
Some people might say
you're prejudiced.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.040
I must get on TV and say I ain't.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.840
No way they'll let you
do another interview.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.750
I'll give them 1 kid.
I'll give them 5 kids.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.190
Bad idea.

53:33.440 --> 53:38.037
We just did an interview. We built what
is probably a positive image of you.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.839
Understand, the public's fickle.

53:40.080 --> 53:44.393
They're on a very short leash of
sympathy. We have a narrow opportunity.

53:44.640 --> 53:48.554
Think of when you'll give up,
when you'll let the children go.

53:48.800 --> 53:51.315
I can't have people saying bad things
about me on TV.

53:51.560 --> 53:55.076
You want to go on and debate neo-Nazis?
Destroy everything?

53:55.320 --> 53:59.519
People got to start saying good things
about me! My friends, my wife.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.594
Okay, let's call her.
It's a good idea. Come on.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.553
I can't talk to my wife.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.519
Why not?
She's probably worried.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.831
Oh, man!
She'll just yell.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.434
You should talk to her.

54:10.680 --> 54:13.878
You should talk to her
because you said you would before.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.794
You go get her and tell her
to say good things about me on TV.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.952
- When?
- And my friends too! Now!

54:21.480 --> 54:23.551
Someone's coming out!

54:24.480 --> 54:25.630
Chief.

54:25.880 --> 54:27.155
Brackett's out.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.513
How are the kids?

54:30.720 --> 54:32.279
What's the condition of the kids?!

54:32.520 --> 54:34.876
Are any more children
going to be released?!

54:35.160 --> 54:36.230
Anybody injured?!

54:36.440 --> 54:39.000
- Over here!
- Whose side are you on?!

54:40.480 --> 54:43.120
- You better tell me he's coming out.
- He wants another story.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.159
- What? Absolutely not.
- He'll give you 5 more kids.

54:46.400 --> 54:49.996
He wants me to talk to his wife,
interview her and a few others.

54:50.240 --> 54:52.072
You're saying no to releasing 5 kids.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.800
No, I want all the kids out here.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.793
How about 5 kids and a teddy bear?

54:56.040 --> 55:00.273
Don't get cute with me, Brackett.
I want him out here and arrested.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.432
He's not ready to give up.
Prison terrifies him.

55:02.680 --> 55:04.956
TV keeps him calm.
I'll interview his wife...

55:05.200 --> 55:08.079
<i>... with you standing there.
Pull the plug anytime you want.</i>

55:08.320 --> 55:09.674
<i>You're walking in and out.</i>

55:09.920 --> 55:11.752
You're supposed to be a hostage.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.514
Let him do it.

55:15.360 --> 55:18.717
You can do it, but you
and Baily better not be playing games.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.040
Son of a gun.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.873
Who's the FBI guy?

55:23.240 --> 55:24.674
Maybe I know him.

55:25.960 --> 55:29.840
Do you know Sam Baily's making you
the most famous cop...

55:30.080 --> 55:31.958
...in the United States of America?

55:34.480 --> 55:36.597
On TV, with those sunglasses...

55:36.840 --> 55:37.910
...you're so sexy.

55:44.840 --> 55:48.356
Mr. Williams is still unconscious
here in room 404.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.314
Doctors are cautious
about the possibility of infection...

55:52.560 --> 55:55.155
...caused by the bullet
still lodged in his abdomen.

55:55.680 --> 55:59.037
What about Cliff Williams?
He cannot know that his attacker...

55:59.280 --> 56:01.272
...became something of a folk hero...

56:01.520 --> 56:05.719
...his words tapping into a nationwide
movement of discontent among the public.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.633
What about Cliff Williams?

56:07.880 --> 56:10.111
<i>But what about Cliff
What about Cliff</i>

56:12.720 --> 56:15.076
<i>Cliff was the one
with the shattered dream</i>

56:17.160 --> 56:18.958
Sam tries real hard.

56:19.200 --> 56:22.272
And sometimes he screws things up
because he's....

56:23.880 --> 56:26.759
It's okay. Tell me,
what kind of a husband is Sam?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.798
He's a good husband.

56:29.640 --> 56:31.154
He's a good husband...

56:32.120 --> 56:34.874
...as long as you--
You have to help to keep him...

56:35.520 --> 56:36.749
...pointed in the right direction.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.276
And, you know.
But I don't understand that.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.477
That's not like him.

56:41.720 --> 56:44.997
Tell me, Jenny, did you
make him lunches the last few days?

56:45.240 --> 56:46.117
He makes his own.

56:46.360 --> 56:50.593
So he's already been fired and yet
he kept making himself lunches...

56:50.840 --> 56:54.880
...kept putting on his uniform
and kept pretending to go to work.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.634
How do you feel about that?

56:58.040 --> 56:59.156
About what?

56:59.400 --> 57:02.040
That he was afraid
to tell you that he was fired?

57:03.360 --> 57:04.635
Do you scare him?

57:05.440 --> 57:07.955
I think that he didn't want to worry me.

57:08.320 --> 57:11.996
Because he was scared?
Think that's a sign of a good marriage?

57:13.560 --> 57:16.792
We had a good marriage.
We have a good marriage.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.238
Did he tell you we didn't?

57:20.480 --> 57:24.474
I'm sure you have a good marriage. But
it seems at times you treat him...

57:24.720 --> 57:25.631
...like a child.

57:26.880 --> 57:28.917
He is like a child sometimes.

57:29.160 --> 57:32.631
And he likes calling himself
my third child.

57:33.480 --> 57:34.357
It's a bad question.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.273
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

57:37.280 --> 57:38.873
Do you still love him?

57:39.360 --> 57:41.272
Yes, I love my husband.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.557
I love my husband very much!

57:43.800 --> 57:45.234
He's the most gentle....

57:45.480 --> 57:48.837
He's the kindest man I've ever known!
The parents of the children....

57:49.080 --> 57:51.549
Grab her.
We'll put her on the line with Sam.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.437
Jenny, we want you to talk to him.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.116
You have to be very careful about that.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.511
He's stressed.
There's no telling how he'll react.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.433
This doesn't concern you.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.319
He's very sensitive
about his wife.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.471
Come with me.

58:04.720 --> 58:05.995
Please don't do this now.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.674
You asked the right question.

58:12.480 --> 58:14.676
I just got that sick taste in my mouth.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.798
So much for bubble gum.

58:17.040 --> 58:19.032
That's too gross for me.

58:29.280 --> 58:32.159
I'm Max's assistant.
I need to get through now.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.792
What are you doing, Sam?

58:39.680 --> 58:41.512
I guess I got myself in a jam, huh?

58:41.760 --> 58:44.320
You've got to come out right now.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.320
How're the sprouts?

58:46.560 --> 58:49.553
<i>They're wondering where their father is,
that's how they are.</i>

58:51.040 --> 58:53.077
They want to put me in prison.

58:55.360 --> 58:58.512
I don't want any more argument.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.071
<i>I want you to come out now.</i>

59:03.360 --> 59:05.113
Is that you on TV?

59:05.480 --> 59:06.596
<i>What?</i>

59:07.000 --> 59:08.673
<i>Put away the gun and come out!</i>

59:08.920 --> 59:10.354
Get away from her!

59:11.000 --> 59:12.229
Put Brackett on the phone!

59:12.640 --> 59:14.199
Forget about Brackett!

59:15.320 --> 59:16.913
Put the gun down....

59:17.440 --> 59:20.399
You tell them right now
I ain't going to prison!

59:20.640 --> 59:22.597
<i>- Put the gun down!</i>
- Go home!

59:22.840 --> 59:24.274
Go home, Jenny!

59:26.720 --> 59:29.155
<i>Jeez, I'm going to get him out myself.</i>

59:29.400 --> 59:31.153
I'm going to get him out myself!

59:31.720 --> 59:33.200
Give me the horn.

59:33.440 --> 59:36.478
Speak into here.
Hold the button down. Talk into here.

59:36.720 --> 59:39.235
Listen, I'd think twice about this.

59:40.520 --> 59:42.034
Please don't do this.

59:44.800 --> 59:46.120
<i>Listen to me!</i>

59:46.360 --> 59:49.000
<i>You've got to stop this nonsense.</i>

59:49.440 --> 59:51.159
<i>- Think about our kids.</i>
- Shut up!

59:51.400 --> 59:53.392
<i>They're waiting for you.</i>

59:53.640 --> 59:55.154
Please, come out.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.631
Please, listen to me.

59:59.040 --> 1:00:02.397
<i>- Sam, please come out now.</i>
- Shut up!

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:04.711
<i>Do you hear me, Sam?</i>

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:05.996
<i>Please...</i>

1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:07.594
<i>...come out now.</i>

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:13.196
That is enough!

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:14.397
Stop it!

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:17.357
- Sam, stop!
- Hold your fire!

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:21.752
Sam, please,
that's enough now! No!

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:26.073
- Stop it!
- This is on your head!

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:32.150
Get away!

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:37.751
Get away from the window!
They'll kill you!

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:47.960
- The lock.
- It's open!

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:50.438
Why'd you let her
say those things on TV?

1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:52.672
You stand at the door,
they'll kill you.

1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:56.910
- What is the problem?
- Why'd you let her say those things?

1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.756
I didn't and that's not a good reason
to shoot over people's heads!

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:02.559
You said you'd talk to her alone.

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.678
It was the police chief's idea.

1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:12.671
People were beginning to like you, then
you start shooting out the window...

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.832
...and your image is down the drain.

1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:20.592
I just got crazy when I seen her on TV,
okay? All the people around her....

1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:22.274
What have I done?

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:29.032
Tell me you won't throw dynamite
out the window.

1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:31.758
You know
I'm not going to do that.

1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:35.915
I screwed up.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.036
I screwed up.

1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:40.192
I'm going to go outside...

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:43.751
...I'm going to do damage control
and you'll be okay.

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:50.590
I'll send you to do interviews.
I'll give you the names...

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.240
...and the questions to ask.

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:53.675
Why can't you do it?

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:57.158
Because I need to be near Sam.
He's getting edgy.

1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:01.313
And tell Lou to send over
the editing bay.

1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:03.592
- I completely forgot.
- What's that?

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:05.593
The editing bay is here.

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:08.156
Kevin Hollander is coming here.

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:10.551
What?

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.635
I think the editing bay is here for him.

1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.434
- He's going to try to freeze us out.
- Why?

1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:24.115
Because he'd love to steal
a story from us.

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:25.796
Kevin Hollander?

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:26.990
You like him.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.919
It's our story.
He wouldn't do that.

1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:32.834
Go to work.

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:35.195
- Thank you.
- Listen, Laurie.

1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:37.955
This is our story
and it's nobody else's.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.591
I'm depending on you.
It's too early to celebrate. Go on.

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:44.150
Don't touch me.
I'll get arrested.

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:51.320
Would you say Sam Baily
is a religious man?

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:53.438
Yes. Sam is religious.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:56.957
But when I say that
you should understand I mean proud...

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:58.794
...and he's kind.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:01.032
Do you think Sam is a fun guy?

1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:05.239
Fun?
Yeah, he's a real fun guy.

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:06.834
In what way?

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:08.950
Gullible.

1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:11.437
You could always play jokes on him.

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:18.351
<i>Is Sam Baily a violent man?</i>

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:23.395
<i>You see any fishermen throwing fits?
No.</i>

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.040
<i>He's not a violent man.</i>

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:28.352
<i>He was not a remarkable student.</i>

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.272
<i>I'm sure you'll find people
who'll say we failed Sam Baily.</i>

1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:36.230
<i>The system isn't set up to provide
a safety net for men like him.</i>

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:40.110
<i>But the only person accountable
for this situation is Sam Baily.</i>

1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:42.158
A compassionate bastard.

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.078
<i>We failed Sam Baily.</i>

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:52.912
<i>The system isn't set up to provide
a safety net for men like him.</i>

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:54.753
That's what I thought you said.

1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:04.800
The parents won't speak to me.

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:07.953
<i>I'm keeping a hole open for this.
They must speak to you.</i>

1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:11.552
The mother's crying and the father has
a stutter. They won't talk on camera.

1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:13.917
<i>You don't get this,
don't come back.</i>

1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:16.277
- Is that clear?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.076
Good.

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:22.039
Mrs. Baily,
I'm really sorry to bother you...

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:24.636
...but I really am trying
to help your son.

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:28.239
I was wondering if he has a horse...

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:29.755
...or a dog.

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:32.554
I want to use it in the story.

1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:37.033
I want to show the people that Sam can't
be that bad if he has a dog he loves.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:40.680
Go, follow.

1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:47.836
We've had him since Sam
got back from the Air Force.

1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:52.677
Old Rex.
He's almost fifteen years old now.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.109
We nearly lost him last year.

1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.760
Sam was a wreck.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.514
He stayed up with him all night...

1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:02.592
...made sure he kept warm.

1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:05.071
He's really a sweet boy.

1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:07.558
He's confused but...

1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:11.149
...all he's trying to do is get by.

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:12.277
<i>Sam was a wreck.</i>

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:15.160
That's the most important interview
of the whole case.

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:17.592
See that?
That's on the money.

1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:18.910
You know what you did?

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:21.755
You got that sweet old woman
saying how Sam loves...

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.993
...that pathetic, mangy,
tick-ridden dog.

1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:31.077
Who's here?

1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:33.471
- Who's coming?
- I have no idea.

1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:43.671
Max is over there.

1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:50.559
See if we can get them
something to drink.

1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:52.280
I'll get it.

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:55.440
I see a great underlying theme here.

1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:59.390
Baily is tapping into something
the working class can relate to.

1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:02.077
What's wrong?
Your numbers taking a dip?

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:08.114
Have a seat, Max.
Look, sit down.

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:11.800
Let's cut the crap.

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:15.234
You and I have had our problems
in the past.

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.553
But you want back on the network.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:19.677
Yes, Kevin.

1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:23.197
You're talking to it.
If you can be a team player...

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:24.999
...this is your ticket back in.

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:27.790
When can I meet him?

1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:30.915
The network wants him
to do a one-on-one with me.

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:34.597
He can't do a one-on-one. He's
in the middle of committing a crime.

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.596
- You've done okay.
- I spent the day and a night with him.

1:06:40.680 --> 1:06:43.832
I think he'll talk to me.
I'm "the man America trusts for news."

1:06:44.080 --> 1:06:46.675
You really shouldn't let
a marketing slogan go to your head.

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:49.276
- Can I get some coffee?
- It'll be ready in 5 minutes.

1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:53.150
Maybe you could both speak to him,
make it more comfortable for him.

1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:56.398
You're the one
who saved the guard.

1:06:57.120 --> 1:06:59.589
No. Yes.
I mean, I helped.

1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.150
I understand you're doing
a new piece on Baily.

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:04.471
Yes, but it's Max's story.

1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:06.473
- Thanks.
- I want to see it.

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.273
I mean, I want to see it now.

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:13.116
<i>Sam Baily stands firm to his appeal
for clemency but the law says no.</i>

1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:16.990
<i>So the waiting continues.
This is Max Brackett reporting.</i>

1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:19.829
That's a testimonial.

1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:22.515
We don't judge people
before they go to trial.

1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:26.276
We don't make them celebrities either.
He's committing a felony.

1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:30.870
No, we're just packaging what
people who knew Baily said about him.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.756
I'll take care of the felonies
in the lead-in.

1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:35.916
I own this story.

1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:39.710
This story is the property of KXBD.
It's the network's.

1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:47.834
I need to make some changes in this.
I want to see everything you shot.

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:52.712
When am I going to have
my meeting with Baily?

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.280
I need to prepare my one-on-one.

1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:56.955
What?
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

1:07:57.200 --> 1:07:59.510
I can't even guarantee he'll do it.

1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:01.114
He'll jump at it.

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:02.589
They all do.

1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:04.356
Fine.

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:08.032
- Excuse me.
- One second.

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:11.755
Why don't you play nice?
This could be very good for you.

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:13.560
Excuse me, Max.

1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:15.234
- Coach Bob is arriving.
- What?

1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:17.278
Coach Bob,
with the food for the kids.

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:20.719
I'll keep it in mind.

1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:31.952
- What about the kids?
- The kids are okay.

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:35.398
I'm worried about Hollander.
Why don't you get him off my back?

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:39.236
I can't.
I can't wrestle 300-pound gorillas!

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:41.313
You guys got the pizza?

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.110
That's it?

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:47.952
We're dying here!

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.872
You can't keep this all to yourself!

1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:54.874
Go to hell, Max!

1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:57.032
- You're an asshole!
- What's going on?

1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:19.158
Get them
to take those skins off, please.

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:22.791
I need you to come back down here
and take the skins off.

1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:28.033
These kids get bored just visiting
a museum. Imagine being trapped in one.

1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:32.193
Have a hamburger.

1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:36.199
You guys knock it off!
Get down here! I got to talk to you!

1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:40.994
That was awesome.

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.038
Everybody, come here!

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:44.270
Come here!

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:45.749
Everybody, quick!

1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:52.399
<i>I can't see very well.
The rain's heavy.</i>

1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:54.640
Where are we going?

1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:56.837
Hey, Mr. Indian Man.

1:09:58.120 --> 1:09:59.190
What's that?

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:01.153
You want me to tell them?

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:03.360
I'll tell them the story.

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.718
Get over there. He wants me
to tell you a story. Go ahead.

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:08.519
Sit down over there.

1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:14.279
Now you kids,
you know the name of this Indian?

1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:16.877
This guy's name is Big John...

1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.476
...and he's a friend of mine.

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:25.480
Do you know what kind of Indian he is?

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:27.399
A Miwok Indian.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.314
Do you know how to say "Miwok"?

1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:37.516
That's good.

1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:40.070
The Indians used to own this country.

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:42.915
They owned it.
This was their home.

1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:47.353
I think I found
one of their arrowheads once.

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:48.590
You did?

1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:51.309
Hold on to it. If Big John finds out,
he'll come and get it.

1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:54.551
The Miwok Indians...

1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:56.792
...they lived off the land.

1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:00.158
They had, like, you know....
They had their own crops.

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:03.120
They hunted and built tepees
out of wood like this.

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:06.592
And, you know,
they had kids just like you.

1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:09.116
Big John was the chief of them.

1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:10.919
Do you know what a chief is?

1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:12.955
The chief is the boss.

1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:14.873
Right.
The chief is the boss.

1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:16.873
The chief is a good boss.

1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:20.034
And a good boss knows
how to take care of his people!

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:33.078
He's too close to the kids.

1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:35.039
The white man came along...

1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:38.478
...and he wanted to take the land
away from the Indians.

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:41.190
And so he killed
all of Big John's people.

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.151
He killed his friends.

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:47.351
He killed his family.

1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:52.398
He's got his rifle drawn on the kids.

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:56.554
That made Big John so sad, he stood
at the top of the valley, like this:

1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:00.555
He looked down and saw everybody.
Everyone he loved was killed.

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:03.360
And he just started
to do an Indian dance...

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:07.193
...to bring them back to life.

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.639
But it didn't work.

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:16.958
And he was so sad his heart froze.

1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:19.149
Is he still alive?

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:20.675
You bet he is.

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:23.195
Museum found him...

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:25.750
...he was like this.

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:33.634
And then when I started to work here
his hand was up here like this.

1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:37.431
And every day I noticed it went
like this, came down like this.

1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:42.158
Then I realized he was just
waving goodbye.

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.599
Let's go! Come on!

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.595
Pick him up!
Pick him up! Run!

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.673
Behind the buffalo!

1:12:58.080 --> 1:12:59.878
I hope we get to see some more!

1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:01.759
That was cool!

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.473
Chief, it's for you!

1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:09.438
What the heck are you doing?
We got kids in here!

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:12.149
Sam, it wasn't us.
No, it wasn't us.

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:15.589
Some nutcase made it
through the perimeter.

1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:17.794
He says it wasn't him.

1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:19.430
Listen.

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:22.036
If this happens again,
I'm calling a parents' conference...

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:24.795
...and tell them you're taking potshots
at their kids.

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:29.637
And I suggest that you tell
the FBI agent you're standing with...

1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:31.234
...that I said so.

1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:34.040
One moment, please.
Anything else, Sam?

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.036
Thank you.

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:39.036
Shit!

1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:42.438
Dobbins, you're a jackoff.

1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:48.630
<i>Joke just gets funnier and funnier,
doesn't it?</i>

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:52.919
<i>And up there in Madeline
we've got this guy, Sam Baily...</i>

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:54.640
<i>...using the Steve Martin defense.</i>

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:56.075
Leno just said my name.

1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:57.834
<i>Hasn't been used in a few years.</i>

1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.912
<i>Well, excuse me!</i>

1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:01.317
<i>Please.</i>

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:06.354
Jay Leno knows who I am.

1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:09.280
Oh, man!

1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:12.520
He's a nice man.

1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:13.671
You met him?

1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:16.674
I did a story on antique cars.
He collects them.

1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:19.193
Who else you met?

1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:23.240
Everyone from the Pope to Mel Gibson.

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:24.436
Mel Gibson?

1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:25.796
What's he like?

1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:31.397
I threw him softball questions.
He threw me softball answers.

1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:33.120
He plays softball?

1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:37.035
I play softball.
I'd get along good with him.

1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:43.918
I bet your wife didn't know
she was getting a celebrity...

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.432
...when she said yes, did she?

1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:49.754
No, I think she knew
exactly what she was getting.

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.151
35 years old and...

1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:56.191
...the only job I could get
is guarding a museum at $8 an hour.

1:14:56.440 --> 1:14:59.717
- How long you been doing it?
- And I can't even keep that.

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.275
5 years.

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:05.600
I was in the Air Force,
you know, but I left...

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:08.357
...because they wouldn't let me fly.

1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:09.636
Why not?

1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:11.109
No college.

1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:13.393
Why didn't you go to college?

1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:15.074
No money.

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:17.196
But....

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.074
The results ain't in yet,
but it appears that I ain't too bright.

1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:24.198
Guess what.
I didn't go either.

1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:25.999
Get out.

1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:27.920
I couldn't afford it.

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.670
Then how'd you get to be so smart?

1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:35.833
The results aren't in yet...

1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:38.879
...but rumor has it
I got by on my charm.

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:42.434
That's something
that you got a lot of:

1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:43.756
Charm.

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.070
Charm.

1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:47.312
Charm. Personality.

1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:48.914
I ain't got no personality.

1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:51.994
Sure you do, otherwise people
wouldn't be responding to you.

1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:55.591
Then I could do
one of those TV shows?

1:15:56.320 --> 1:15:58.710
Why not?
You're already famous.

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:00.509
Yeah, but...

1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:02.712
...I'm famous in a bad way.

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:05.998
It doesn't make any difference on TV.
People know who you are.

1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:07.920
Like them fishing shows.

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:10.516
I heard that you were a great fisherman.

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:12.513
I'd like to do a fishing show.

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:16.794
Fish all day on TV and you get to go...

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:18.475
...see the best spots.

1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:20.234
All the new equipment.

1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:22.315
I'd like that.

1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:26.759
I'll tell you what. When this is over,
I'll recommend you to my station.

1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:30.191
Nah. It's over for me.

1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:33.877
Things are bad, but at least people
are sympathizing with you now.

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:36.280
Am I going to jail?

1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:37.397
Best-case scenario...

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:39.833
...you'll do a little time...

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:41.958
...you'll get some probation.
Then....

1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:44.317
..."Sam Baily's Catfish Corner."

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:46.235
Yeah, right.

1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:50.233
Stranger things have happened.

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:52.437
I was up and I was down.

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.956
Now I'm up again,
thanks to you.

1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:00.037
Who knows? You might be back in your
wife's arms sooner than you think.

1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:02.716
They got too much light, them kids.

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:07.270
Back in my loving woman's arms again.

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.912
- You married?
- Been there.

1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:17.480
You got kids?

1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:18.710
1 out of 3.

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.110
What's that mean?

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:23.558
One kid, three wives.
My last wife didn't even wait...

1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:26.360
...for me to leave.
She took off with the kid.

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.910
I couldn't leave my family.

1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:32.392
You'd be surprised
what you can learn to live with.

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:35.313
You don't want to take those.

1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:38.439
Sam, why don't you
get yourself some sleep?

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.832
Nothing's going to happen, I promise.

1:18:00.520 --> 1:18:02.193
Can I go to the candy room?

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.510
We're hungry.

1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:05.160
Yeah. Go, go.

1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:10.553
<i>Well, Max,
they are suggesting that...</i>

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:14.316
...if you have any control
over the situation...

1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:18.476
...it wouldn't be a bad idea
if Baily surrendered in the evening.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:19.551
Prime time?

1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:22.235
<i>Their Thursdays are particularly weak.</i>

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:24.680
Oh, Jesus, Marty!

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:27.355
I know, Max. I know.

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:30.956
<i>So let's forget about this.
They're asking--</i>

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:34.511
Tell them this is my story
and Hollander is trying to steal it.

1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.319
They know that.

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:38.632
They're asking you
to let him have Baily.

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:41.793
In exchange,
they're offering you your own show.

1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:44.350
Magazine, <i>60 Minutes</i> format...

1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:46.751
...investigative, in-your-face....

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.037
They say,
and it remains to be seen...

1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:51.840
...you will have editorial freedom,
whatever that means.

1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:55.551
But it will be national and they
are talking about real money.

1:18:56.800 --> 1:18:58.439
<i>Do I lock the deal down?</i>

1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:01.240
<i>--but I know what it's like to be angry.</i>

1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:03.676
<i>I understand what it's like
to not have a future.</i>

1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:06.355
T-shirts, right here!
Get your Sam T-shirts!

1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:08.319
One size fits all!

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:26.154
What a circus!

1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:31.317
They tried to cut a deal in the Foothill
Federal fraud last night.

1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:34.155
With this nonsense, they didn't think
anybody'd notice.

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:35.550
Brackett was right.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:36.870
Banker's a crook.

1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:39.431
Laurie, I'd like to assign you to--

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:41.876
There's something you can help me with.

1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:45.592
If Baily doesn't talk tonight,
I'll need a sidebar.

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:49.233
Do you think you could plug me in
out in the field?

1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:52.439
I was planning to free you up
to work on the bank fraud.

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:56.796
People have lost their life savings.
Nobody's covering the story.

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.838
It's not the microphone.
You really must talk louder.

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:07.480
Could you please come....

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:12.353
- Don't touch me.
- No one's allowed in.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:16.719
I really must advise against this.
Your husband is just not strong enough.

1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:18.474
Mrs. Williams...

1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:20.679
...I saved your husband's life.

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:23.839
His first interview
should be with Kevin Hollander.

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:27.199
We really need the money.

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:31.439
3, 2....

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:34.914
Cliff,
Sam Baily, the man who shot you...

1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:38.676
...is pleading for forgiveness.
How do you feel about that?

1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:40.434
I've known Sam for a long time.

1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:42.319
<i>I don't think he meant to hurt me.</i>

1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:43.830
That's right, Cliff.

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:46.072
<i>Doctor said it looks like I'll be okay.</i>

1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:47.640
<i>I got no problem with him.</i>

1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:50.793
- See? You're a very lucky man.
- How's that?

1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:52.759
He just gave you his blessing.

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:56.831
Did Cliff get money to do that show?

1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:58.560
Sure. It's a tabloid.

1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:00.712
Big bucks. Show business.

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:01.871
How much?

1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:03.634
I don't know. 10 grand.

1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:04.791
10 grand?

1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:08.440
If Cliff can get 10 grand,
I could get 50 grand.

1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:10.160
I'm the whole deal.

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.671
I thought this wasn't about ransom.

1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:14.794
This ain't about ransom.

1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:16.679
About show business.

1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:20.552
Left, right, left.

1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:24.432
You shoot a guy, take kids hostage
and now you want money for it.

1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:26.831
How do you think that'll look to people?

1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:29.390
I don't care.
I got to make money for my family.

1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:32.678
Maybe later you'll write a book,
we'll make a TV movie....

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:35.480
I know people who might
help you with that. But not now.

1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:39.999
I need to check out them shows to see
how much they pay. You go do that.

1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:46.590
What?

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:50.159
No, it's just the kids playing around.
What is it?

1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:52.756
Hollander wants to see you right away.

1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:54.360
That's it? Fine.

1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:55.431
What's up?

1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:00.831
You want to make money on this,
you call the tabloids.

1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:04.915
You don't need me for this.
I got Kevin Hollander out there.

1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:08.949
We planned to do an important show
on you, but you do what you want.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:10.990
Kevin Hollander?

1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:12.515
He's here?

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:29.760
Listen,
Larry King wants to make you an offer.

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.912
A full hour tonight,
you and your boy.

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:34.197
- Talk to my agent.
- This is global.

1:22:34.440 --> 1:22:35.430
The networks can't compete.

1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:37.797
I have something else going for him.

1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:39.351
Come here.

1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:41.840
You know where to reach me.

1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:45.640
What did Gottsegen want?

1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:47.473
I'll give you 3 guesses.

1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:50.755
The network wants you
to turn Baily over to me.

1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:52.793
I'm doing a prime-time special.

1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:55.760
You're creative.
Maybe you could get him a variety show.

1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.312
You little fuck, if you want back on
the network, turn Baily over to me now.

1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:07.991
Don't screw this up for yourself, okay?

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.516
Sam belongs to the network, okay?

1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:16.120
You hired her.

1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:17.760
You taught her.

1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:20.953
Oh, come on, Max.

1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:32.152
How is this going to end?

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:37.354
I'm getting out of here.

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.753
Or what?

1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:42.717
Because they're not going to let you go.

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:44.316
Max Brackett said--

1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:46.950
Max Brackett is not your friend, Sam.

1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:52.515
If you had listened to me for 5 minutes,
that's all I wanted.

1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:55.275
I wish I had listened to you.

1:23:56.440 --> 1:23:58.955
But this is much bigger
than you and me now.

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:01.999
They're forcing you
to do something drastic.

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:05.916
I don't want to scare you,
but they're....

1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:08.559
They're ready to kill you.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:12.674
And Max Brackett
is not going to stop them.

1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:19.792
You know what? You've been
so sweet to me, how can I say no?

1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:21.713
You've got your show.

1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:24.159
All right. That's smart.

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:27.274
- What?
- Congratulations.

1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:28.874
Okay, just a sec.

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:33.718
You were right.
The polls have turned against him.

1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:39.117
It's flipped.
59% positive down to 32% and sliding.

1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:40.874
It's the kids' parents.

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:43.919
They're all over television
and they're just killing him.

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:45.197
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:46.635
Baily's polls....

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:51.597
I want to make this as objective
and balanced as we can.

1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:55.675
I want to see more stuff
on the guy in the hospital.

1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:58.799
Somewhere,
somebody says he's dangerous.

1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:00.713
I want to see that.

1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:04.119
I want to see pieces
on the racists out there.

1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:07.876
Why are they piling on this bandwagon,
cheering him on?

1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:10.476
Start pulling that material.
Get back to me.

1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:13.720
It's going to be great
working in New York together.

1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:17.237
You're not being objective.
You want to sink him.

1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:18.550
We have a deal.

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:21.440
He's sunk. It's over.
It's another kind of story.

1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:25.800
He's the same person.
You can't do this. He's an innocent.

1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:29.716
- I'll put that angle in the story.
- Not an angle.

1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:31.917
It's not an angle,
it's the truth.

1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:34.950
- He shot a guard.
- It was an accident.

1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:38.511
He didn't know the guard was there,
that the children would be there.

1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:40.638
He's an out of work husband.
He's--

1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:44.191
We're all impressed with your humanity.
Really.

1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:47.073
Where's yours?
You'll kill him.

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:50.917
Cut this stuff out. Get out of here.
Let's get back to business.

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:52.310
"Business"?

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:53.676
Yeah.

1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:55.956
Business.

1:25:56.800 --> 1:25:59.395
Max, come here.
Let me give you a little advice.

1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:01.313
Don't screw this up again.

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:03.552
You got a network deal here.

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:05.872
Don't blow it for some hick with a gun.

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:09.670
You know what?
I'm not going to let you destroy him.

1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:13.234
Pal, if you don't deliver Baily to me...

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:18.680
...you'll be lucky to get a gig
giving the surfing report in Kansas.

1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:23.080
Kansas is starting to sound
pretty good to me.

1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:31.516
Getting harder to move the line?

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:33.160
It doesn't move.
You cross it.

1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:36.552
- That's not what you said before.
- I know it now, Lou.

1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:46.960
It's time, Sam.

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:50.280
What do you mean, it's time?

1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:52.432
It's time to give up.

1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:57.350
What are you talking about? You said
you'd set up an interview with that guy.

1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:00.599
Hollander's getting ready to hurt you.
He'll make you look bad.

1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:03.912
- I ain't afraid of him.
- Be afraid. Be very afraid.

1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:07.112
I ain't afraid of anybody right now.

1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:10.560
- I can take care of myself.
- No, you can't.

1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:15.475
You told me that the people like me.

1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:19.037
I also said the public's very fickle.

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:23.714
If you don't set it up with Hollander,
I will.

1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:24.916
Fine.

1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:26.920
Let's get someone else.

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:28.830
Is he as big as him?

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:30.156
Bigger.

1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:31.755
And nicer.

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:34.956
Fine.

1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:40.200
Set it up, newsboy.

1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:41.874
Sam, I'm on your side.

1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:43.554
After the interview...

1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.999
...you and I will end it.

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.229
<i>You lost the exclusive.</i>

1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:50.914
No, I didn't.
I did not lose it.

1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:52.833
<i>- Made us look preposterous.</i>
- I didn't.

1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:57.552
After announcing all day your one-on-one
with Baily, now you want to what?

1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:00.520
Just look stupid?
You want the network to look witless?

1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:02.956
<i>- Jeremy, listen to me.</i>
- No, you listen to me.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:04.759
You're done.
You're coming home.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.595
<i>No, I am not coming back there.
I'm staying here.</i>

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:08.751
It's Brackett's now.

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:12.710
I'll take care of Brackett. I won't let
anyone say I let the network down.

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:14.519
Nobody's going to say that.

1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:19.237
- Do you got everything I need?
- Everything is here.

1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:21.073
<i>How are the kids, Sam?</i>

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:29.035
<i>You've got a couple of your own,
don't you?</i>

1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:30.191
I got 2.

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:33.478
<i>Are they friends, by the way,
with any of these kids?</i>

1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:35.837
No. I mean,
they're different ages.

1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:40.757
<i>Let's go to calls. Van Nuys,
California, you have a question?</i>

1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:45.711
<i>What would you say to the people of the
former Soviet Union who are suffering...</i>

1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:48.634
<i>...hardships greater than your own
in the United States?</i>

1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.553
I don't speak Russian.

1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:52.871
Sam has a normal complement
of compassion.

1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:57.873
<i>Max Brackett, veteran newsman.
By the way, why are you here, Max?</i>

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:00.954
I'm just here to help.
Sam wants me here, so I'm here.

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:04.511
<i>Wichita, Kansas,
you're on the air with Sam Baily.</i>

1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:10.831
<i>Liberals are saying guys like you
show why we need more gun control laws.</i>

1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:12.594
I can't believe
they made us watch.

1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:16.516
Everybody's got their own opinion
on that kind of thing.

1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:19.798
To politicize this tragedy
is to go the wrong way.

1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:22.271
<i>Max, this is my show.</i>

1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:25.479
<i>Please. Sam's doing well.
You don't have to answer.</i>

1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:28.792
<i>I know this is your show,
but I'm here to help.</i>

1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:31.430
<i>I hope your show
helps this difficult situation as well.</i>

1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:33.194
<i>Lubbock, Texas, go ahead.</i>

1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:35.796
<i>How long are you going to hold out?</i>

1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:39.833
- He just needs space.
- He was talking to me!

1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:41.036
It's been very...

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:42.953
...stressful...

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:44.316
...for him.

1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:50.191
I don't think you know
the seriousness of this.

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:52.716
Okay?
Something's going to happen here.

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:55.714
<i>You want to elaborate on that, Sam?</i>

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:57.992
No, that's all. That's it.

1:29:58.240 --> 1:29:59.560
<i>From Madeline...</i>

1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:03.396
<i>...I understand we have the mother
of one of the hostages.</i>

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:04.596
<i>Are you there?</i>

1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:07.878
<i>Yes, I am. Thank you, Larry.
And thank you...</i>

1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:10.077
<i>...for giving me a worldwide audience.</i>

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:11.754
Hey, it's my mom.

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.559
- Is it really?
- It's my mom.

1:30:13.840 --> 1:30:17.470
<i>This man has been pointing a gun
at my child for 3 days.</i>

1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:19.439
<i>What about them?</i>

1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:24.436
<i>Why do you deserve our sympathy after
what you've done to those hostages?</i>

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:27.431
I don't want no sympathy, all right?

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:31.195
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I'm not trying--

1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:32.955
<i>What're you trying to do?</i>

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:39.031
I think I know what I want to say.

1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:40.516
Go ahead.

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.917
I was just taking care of my own.

1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:49.120
Every man in my situation
would take care of his own.

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:50.760
That's all I was doing.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.469
<i>You don't feel guilt
for what's gone down?</i>

1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:54.790
I feel bad.

1:30:55.040 --> 1:30:56.713
You know, I feel bad.

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:00.675
But I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:03.750
Quit.

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:06.197
You know, it ain't my fault.

1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:08.591
<i>Whose fault is it?
Who are you mad at?</i>

1:31:08.840 --> 1:31:10.513
I ain't mad at anybody.

1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:13.639
I mean, maybe,
you know, Mrs. Banks...

1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:15.234
...a little, that's all.

1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:17.233
<i>We don't care about his excuses.</i>

1:31:17.480 --> 1:31:21.872
<i>People like Max Brackett and the media
are turning him into some kind of hero.</i>

1:31:22.120 --> 1:31:26.512
<i>We found this to be a good opportunity
to present all perspectives--</i>

1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:30.071
<i>Since when do we need
all perspectives of a crime?</i>

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:31.390
<i>Please...</i>

1:31:31.640 --> 1:31:33.313
<i>...just let my child go.</i>

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:35.040
<i>Let them all go.</i>

1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:37.672
<i>Sam, response?</i>

1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:41.270
Just tell the lady I'm sorry, okay?

1:31:42.720 --> 1:31:44.154
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:46.876
<i>We're clear.</i>

1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:50.360
<i>We'll be back in 2 minutes.</i>

1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:53.752
- If you're uncomfortable, don't answer.
- Don't tell me what to do!

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.071
- Don't answer my questions.
- You're not obligated.

1:31:56.320 --> 1:31:58.710
People want to hear from me
what's on my mind!

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.839
- You need help sometimes.
- You don't need to sit here.

1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.280
Fine. I'm outside.

1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:06.910
- I'll take care of this.
- You're in the shithouse.

1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:08.594
And don't leave the building!

1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:11.874
Everybody knows about it if I get mad!
Sit down!

1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:15.557
You're erasing everything we built!
You've buried yourself!

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:24.311
Can I talk to that guy from Texas?

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:27.190
- You all set?
- Yes. It's all set.

1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:29.318
I've got to talk to you.

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:32.155
She ought to have something
more upscale. More color.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:35.917
New York is not happy you're going on
without checking with them.

1:32:36.160 --> 1:32:39.995
Brackett is a freelancer.
He's not with the network. Don't worry.

1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:42.596
They need to know
what you're planning on doing.

1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:45.990
The other networks are leading
with Larry King.

1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:48.800
Tomorrow they'll be leading
with my stuff.

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:03.871
Good evening
from Madeline, California...

1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:05.395
...where the eyes of the nation...

1:33:05.640 --> 1:33:09.714
...remain fixed on the events taking
place inside the museum behind me.

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:14.518
<i>But the real story I've uncovered since
I arrived here is even more troubling.</i>

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:15.591
Quiet!

1:33:15.840 --> 1:33:19.516
<i>I came to understand the unconventional
relationship between a reporter...</i>

1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:21.991
<i>...and his subject,
and I began to worry.</i>

1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:26.837
<i>And as I learned more about Sam Baily's
personality, I began to worry even more.</i>

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:30.273
<i>The testimonies on Mr. Baily
were not reassuring.</i>

1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:32.318
<i>He's really a sweet boy.</i>

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:36.716
<i>He's confused,
but all he's trying to do is get by.</i>

1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:40.078
<i>Sometimes he screws things up
because he's....</i>

1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:42.591
<i>You could say he's pretty weird.</i>

1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:44.069
<i>Does he have a temper?</i>

1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:45.834
I don't even know that guy.

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:49.596
<i>- I've seen him have a temper.
- So you'd call him dangerous.</i>

1:33:49.840 --> 1:33:51.877
<i>Dangerous, yeah. Dangerous.</i>

1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:54.430
<i>This confused and dangerous man...</i>

1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:57.240
<i>...is being advised by the reporter
covering the story.</i>

1:33:57.480 --> 1:33:59.597
Things are breaking down in there.

1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:02.672
Let's get ready to move.

1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:05.956
<i>In his effort to tell
a more compelling story...</i>

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:09.238
<i>...the reporter, Max Brackett,
may have increased the danger...</i>

1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:11.915
<i>...in an already critical situation.</i>

1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:14.197
<i>I had hoped my suspicions were wrong.</i>

1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:15.670
<i>Sadly, they were right.</i>

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:18.515
<i>I can guarantee
Mr. Baily is sincere in his offer.</i>

1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:22.640
<i>I think things'll become increasingly
unstable if you don't grant him this.</i>

1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:27.671
<i>Two little girls were set free,
supposedly at the behest of Baily.</i>

1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:30.833
<i>But tapes of conversations
tell a far different story.</i>

1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:32.833
<i>- Let's give them 2.
- I said one.</i>

1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:36.039
<i>You shot a black man. Some people
are going to make an issue of that.</i>

1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:39.637
<i>Show kindness to a black kid, it's hard
to play the race card against you.</i>

1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:42.634
<i>A story that places a colleague
in an unfavorable light...</i>

1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:44.599
<i>...is not one any newsman wants to tell.</i>

1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:46.433
Yeah, Kevin's the best.

1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:49.952
We had to improvise this
after Brackett sold us out.

1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:51.556
Here he is.

1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:55.159
The numbers are high.

1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:59.190
<i>There are children inside that building,
held hostage at gunpoint.</i>

1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:02.678
<i>And inside that building
there is also the truth.</i>

1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.034
<i>The facts of this story
are also held hostage, unfortunately...</i>

1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:08.430
<i>...by Max Brackett.</i>

1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:11.752
<i>And I'm sorry to say
they are all at great risk.</i>

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.277
<i>I'll be back with more
of our special report after this.</i>

1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:22.713
What did you do to me, newsboy?

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:25.953
I took a bad story
and made it good TV.

1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:28.192
You're still in better shape.
I'm screwed!

1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:32.116
What you want to do now
is give up and let those kids go.

1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:36.639
There's still people on my side.

1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:41.591
You said you've seen these things
on TV before. Remember how they end?

1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:45.111
The guy dies or he winds up in jail.

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:47.994
You ain't my friend.

1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:54.876
Shoot.

1:35:56.560 --> 1:35:59.951
You kill someone, you'll spend your life
in jail, or they'll fry you.

1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:01.520
Please don't shoot him, Sam.

1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:06.632
It's not over for you, Sam.

1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:09.073
Will you get your act together?

1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:11.469
You want to go home and be a daddy.

1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:23.870
Hey, kids.

1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.236
Guess what?

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:27.552
I got some good news for you.

1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:31.918
<i>This is Lawrence Dobbins of the FBI.</i>

1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.272
<i>You're going to free your hostages...</i>

1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:36.637
<i>...lay down your weapons...</i>

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:38.234
<i>...and surrender.</i>

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:39.709
<i>Now!</i>

1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:41.914
I wanted it to be my idea.

1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:49.355
<i>You have five minutes
to lay down your weapons...</i>

1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.319
<i>...and surrender.</i>

1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.790
<i>I just learned Cliff Williams
is experiencing cardiac problems.</i>

1:36:57.040 --> 1:36:59.953
Doctors are working feverishly
to revive him.

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:03.714
Wait,
I see Mrs. Williams coming out now.

1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:08.679
Would you like to make a statement
about your husband's condition?

1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:11.751
Would you like to make a statement?

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:13.355
Please!

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:14.910
I want people to see...

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:16.799
<i>... what this is all about.</i>

1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:19.995
<i>I want all the people...</i>

1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:23.039
<i>... who've been worrying
about Sam Baily's side...</i>

1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:25.317
<i>....to start thinking about my children.</i>

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.435
<i>Their father is dead!</i>

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:31.431
<i>My husband is dead.</i>

1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:38.799
<i>Mount Trinity Hospital has just
announced the death of Cliff Williams.</i>

1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:41.396
<i>The tragedy of this simple man
started...</i>

1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:45.998
<i>... when Baily shot him because he tried
to help the children taken hostage.</i>

1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:48.960
<i>After almost 3 days of the most unusual
hostage situation....</i>

1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:53.877
<i>Samuel Baily,
this is Lawrence Dobbins of the FBI.</i>

1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:57.679
<i>You must free those hostages.</i>

1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:00.114
<i>Lay down your weapon...</i>

1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:02.600
<i>...and surrender...</i>

1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:04.315
<i>...now!</i>

1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:06.439
Kids, come on.

1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:17.196
Come on.

1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:23.635
All right, go!

1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:25.553
- See you, Sam.
- See you.

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:26.950
Good night, Sam.

1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:29.114
I'll pray for you.

1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:30.680
Good luck, Sam.

1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:34.954
Thank you, Sam.

1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.112
Look at all those lights.

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:00.597
You were great with the kids.

1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:02.513
The court will remember that.

1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:07.750
But I killed a man.

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.595
It was an accident.
I'll testify to it.

1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.712
Nobody would believe you anymore?

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:16.679
That's a good point.

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:19.911
Would you like to talk to your wife?

1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:21.999
Let me get her on the phone.

1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.433
I heard about Cliff.

1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:28.629
I killed him.

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.514
I didn't mean to kill him.

1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:35.919
You still have our kids to think about.

1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:38.516
- How are they doing?
<i>- They miss you.</i>

1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:41.036
I miss you so much.

1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:43.633
They want you home.

1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.630
Jen, I can't come home.
I ain't no good anymore.

1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:51.671
Honey...

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:57.312
...it's time that we get this over with.

1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:58.789
I know.

1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:01.280
You mad at me?

1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:05.672
No, I'm not.

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:07.513
I love you.

1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:09.753
I love you too.

1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:13.590
<i>This is Chief Lemke.
I'm asking you to come out now.</i>

1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:17.993
Oh, God!

1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:21.750
Come on, Sam.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.275
Let's get out of here.

1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:25.080
You go first.

1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:27.357
- You go first.
- Okay. Sure.

1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:32.317
I'll get them to put their guns away and
then I'll come back and get you, okay?

1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:38.394
What actor do you want
to play you in the TV movie?

1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:42.840
How about that guy Mel Gibson?

1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:45.232
Mel Gibson doesn't do television.

1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:47.876
- Why not?
- You're right. Why not?

1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:50.756
Bad joke.
I'll explain it to you later.

1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:52.878
Why? Television's good.

1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:21.029
He's coming out now!
Unarmed!

1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:07.033
Come away from the building!

1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:09.078
No, I am not going to send him out...

1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:12.040
...till I see you tell them
to put their guns away!

1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:14.192
Step away from the door!

1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:16.199
He's coming out!

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:20.594
What are you doing?

1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:22.433
Sam, open up!

1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:24.399
They're going to let you come out!

1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:27.000
We have a deal! Come on!

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:30.119
Give me a few more seconds!

1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:34.195
He is coming out! He's just
a little nervous! He's coming out!

1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:54.080
We're still rolling!

1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:58.075
This is Oscar Harrington, live
on the scene in front of the museum.

1:42:58.320 --> 1:42:59.720
There's been an explosion.

1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:05.880
Debris is everywhere.

1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:13.433
Somebody get the camera.

1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:23.471
It looks like Max Brackett's alive.

1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:31.793
Come on, I can walk.

1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:45.239
Let me just go over there.

1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:51.314
Stay with him.

1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:54.035
I'm okay.

1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:08.795
Get in there. Get as close as you can,
find out what he knows.

1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:11.952
What were his last words?

1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:16.275
I'm Max Brackett's assistant!

1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:20.400
You'll go exclusive on this for me?

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:22.233
Sure. Where's Sam?

1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:26.032
Sam? Sam is confetti.
No, don't wipe that.

1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:28.960
How does that make you feel?

1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:30.230
Where is he?

1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:35.116
What did you say?

1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:37.795
Sam's dead.
It's a bigger story now.

1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:43.110
Don't wipe it.

1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:44.555
It looks good.

1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:46.155
Zoom in.

1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:47.996
We killed him.

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:49.594
Could anybody have helped him?

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:53.390
- Did he say anything?
- Did he give you a message for his wife?

1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:54.915
What are you feeling?

1:44:57.360 --> 1:44:59.511
You don't understand!
We killed him!

1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:00.876
We killed him!

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:02.874
We killed him.

1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:06.319
You don't understand!

1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:08.998
We killed him!

1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:55.752
