WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:07.375
(woman screaming )

00:09.677 --> 00:12.840
(whimpering)

00:13.014 --> 00:15.972
Alex: We should've never
put up the signs.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.508
What the hell did we think
was gonna happen?

00:25.067 --> 00:26.853
We brought them here.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.530
We were trying
to do something good.

00:33.701 --> 00:37.114
-( laughs)
- We were being human beings.

00:37.288 --> 00:40.030
What are we now, Gareth?

00:40.208 --> 00:42.870
(woman screaming )

00:54.639 --> 00:57.972
( radio chatter)

00:58.142 --> 01:01.259
Abraham: They seemed nice enough,
but I was ready to go.

01:01.437 --> 01:04.395
We just got here,
but, damn,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.305
it was time to go.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.600
When I told them about DC,

01:08.778 --> 01:11.235
a wink and a nod from
the head asshole in charge,

01:11.405 --> 01:12.906
they pulled their guns
and it was right back

01:13.074 --> 01:16.237
to our regularly scheduled
shitstorm.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.902
Sasha: Before they put you in here,
you didn't see Tyreese?

01:20.081 --> 01:22.072
- Michonne: No.
- Sasha: Good.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.582
Daryl: Black car with a white cross
painted on it.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.084
I tried to follow it.
I tried.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.745
Maggie:
But she's alive?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.459
Daryl:
She's alive.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.086
( radio chatter continues )

01:40.268 --> 01:44.102
( men chatting )

01:44.272 --> 01:46.604
- Man: What are you doing?
- Man #2: Everybody shut up.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.230
Shut up!

01:48.401 --> 01:51.609
All right, got four of them pricks
coming our way.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.614
Y'all know what to do.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.524
Go for their eyes first.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.034
Then their throats.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.575
Man: Put your backs to the walls
on either end of the car now!

02:10.131 --> 02:13.294
( clanging )

02:18.139 --> 02:19.174
Move!

02:20.933 --> 02:22.673
(all coughing)

02:22.852 --> 02:26.094
(doors opening )

02:27.732 --> 02:29.973
( gas mask hissing )

02:32.737 --> 02:34.853
- Man: Move!
- Man #2: Get up!

02:35.031 --> 02:37.022
(grunts)

02:40.786 --> 02:43.402
( distorted voice, indistinct)

02:44.999 --> 02:48.992
(saw buzzing )

03:31.879 --> 03:33.289
Okay, hold up.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.980
All right.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.786
(whimpering)

04:18.008 --> 04:21.000
( muffled screaming )

04:39.989 --> 04:41.854
-( knife slices)
-( blood pouring)

04:42.032 --> 04:44.239
( man, muffled )
Please, no! No!

05:00.593 --> 05:03.335
Hey, guys.
What were your shot counts?

05:03.512 --> 05:05.844
- 38.
-(thuds)

05:15.733 --> 05:17.143
Gareth:
Hey!

05:17.318 --> 05:19.400
Your shot count?

05:23.032 --> 05:24.772
Crap, man, I'm sorry.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.326
It was my first roundup.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.200
Gareth: After you're done here,
go back to your point

05:28.370 --> 05:29.746
and count the shells.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.654
Kaylee won't be gathering them
until tomorrow.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.368
( Bob, muffled )
Hey.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.533
Hey, let me talk to you.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.495
Four from A, four from D?

05:39.673 --> 05:40.753
Man:
Yeah.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.041
Hey, let me talk
to you for a minute.

05:43.219 --> 05:45.005
Let me talk to you
for a minute.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.135
- Let me talk to you for a minute.
- What?

05:47.306 --> 05:49.388
Don't do this.
We can fix this.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.844
- No, you can't.
- You don't have to do this.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.010
We told you there's a way
out of all of this.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.357
You just have to take a chance.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.228
We have a man
who knows how to stop it.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.392
He has a cure.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.687
We just have to get him
to Washington.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.446
You don't have to do this, man.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.733
We can put the world
back to how it was.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.865
Can't go back, Bob.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.121
We can!
You don't have to do--

06:28.639 --> 06:30.800
We saw you go
into the woods with a bag

06:30.975 --> 06:32.931
and come out without it.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.684
Had to pull my spotters back
before we could go look for it.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.273
What was in it?

06:41.569 --> 06:43.230
You hid it, right?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.774
In case things went bad?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.031
Smart.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.738
Still, we'll find it.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.073
But it's too dangerous
to go out there right now.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.834
What was in it?

07:05.009 --> 07:06.670
I'm curious.

07:06.844 --> 07:10.757
And it was a big bag.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.675
You really gonna let me do this?

07:16.854 --> 07:18.765
Well, let me take you out there.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.271
I'll show you.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.808
Not gonna happen,
but this might.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.942
Rick:
There's guns in it.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.939
AK-47.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.982
.44 Magnum.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.653
Automatic weapons.
Nightscope.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.914
There's a compound bow

07:39.084 --> 07:42.417
and a machete
with a red handle.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.255
That's what I'm gonna use
to kill you.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.924
( chuckles )

07:54.308 --> 07:56.094
(sighs)

07:57.394 --> 07:58.645
Thanks.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.891
You have two hours
to get them on the driers.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.306
Then we go back to public face.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.769
Now's the time
we can get messy,

08:04.943 --> 08:06.979
but we need to dial it all in
by sundown.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.985
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.860
( gunshots)

08:14.828 --> 08:15.988
Hey, Chuck?

08:17.206 --> 08:18.992
(gunshot)

08:22.169 --> 08:24.034
( explosion )

08:24.213 --> 08:27.046
(theme music playing )

09:08.048 --> 09:10.209
We're close.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.751
I'm gonna get you both there,
make sure you're safe.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.715
(Judith coos)

09:15.889 --> 09:17.880
But I'm not gonna stay.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.266
( raspy breathing )

09:32.531 --> 09:34.943
(snarling )

09:39.997 --> 09:42.329
(crying)

09:43.333 --> 09:46.075
I can't. Not yet.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.666
You're going to have
to be able to.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.926
(snarling )

10:04.480 --> 10:05.970
( whispers )
More.

10:22.498 --> 10:25.114
(snarling )

10:39.848 --> 10:43.090
( gunshots)

10:59.743 --> 11:02.280
(gunshots continue)

11:27.563 --> 11:29.474
it could have been
from Terminus.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.139
Someone was attacking them.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.933
Or they were attacking someone.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.444
Do we even want to find out?

11:40.075 --> 11:41.906
Yeah.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.738
There's another track due east.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.619
It'll get us there.
We'll be real careful.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.914
We're gonna get answers.

12:01.889 --> 12:02.924
Woman on radio:
10-minute count.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.963
You screw up,
you're on your own, Martin.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.310
You don't have to tell me.
| wipe my own ass.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.568
Alex didn't get it.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.443
See, I knew the chick
with the sword was bad news.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.775
Bitch looked like a weapon
with a weapon.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.866
He was always
a sloppy-ass mother.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.824
Yeah, I told Albert I want the kid's hat
after they bleed him out.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.123
Keep your finger
off the button and drop it.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.282
(mmodmmm)

12:32.461 --> 12:33.917
They're only doing eight
before public face.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.419
- Don't wait on 'em.
- Listen, y'all don't have to do this.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.546
Whatever you want, we got a place
where everyone's welcome.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.207
- Shut up, man.
- Okay.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.966
We're friends
of the chick with the sword

12:42.137 --> 12:43.923
and the kid in the hat.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.091
They attacked us.
We're just holding them.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.770
I don't believe you.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.099
Who else do you have?
Do you know their names?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.979
We just have the boy
and the samurai, that's it.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.061
We were just protecting ourselves.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.146
I don't believe you.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.108
There's a bunch of us out there
in six different directions.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.988
There was a lot of gunfire
back home.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.615
We need to set off our charges
all at the same time

13:05.786 --> 13:06.775
to confuse the dead ones away.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.445
- That's good for you, too.
- No, it isn't.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.615
There's a herd heading
toward Terminus right now.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.909
We don't want
to confuse them away.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.748
We're gonna need their help.

13:17.756 --> 13:18.745
It's a compound.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.006
They'll see you coming.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.885
If you even make it that far
with all the cold bodies heading over.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.636
Carol.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.593
How are you gonna do this?

13:30.435 --> 13:32.596
I'm gonna kill people.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.482
(flies buzzing )

14:07.806 --> 14:09.512
She got a name?

14:13.645 --> 14:16.136
Hey, she got a name?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.055
Judith.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.190
She your daughter or something?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.272
She's a friend.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.187
Huh.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.859
(sighs)

14:30.037 --> 14:31.527
I don't have any friends.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.036
I mean, I know people.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.458
They're just assholes
| stay alive with.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.535
The other one your friend?
The woman?

14:48.597 --> 14:50.337
| used to have 'em.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.598
Used to watch football
on Sundays.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.553
Went to church.
( laughs )

14:57.731 --> 15:00.518
I know I did.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.774
But I can't picture it anymore.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.650
It's funny how you don't even
notice the time go by.

15:07.824 --> 15:11.157
Horrible shit just stacks up
day after day.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.239
You get used to it.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.571
I haven't gotten used to it.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.785
Of course you haven't.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.917
You're the kind of guy
who saves babies.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.079
It's kind of like saving an anchor
when you're stuck without a boat

15:23.256 --> 15:25.042
in the middle of the ocean.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.258
Been behind
some kind of walls, right?

15:34.559 --> 15:36.515
You're still around, but you haven't
had to get your hands dirty.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.812
I can tell.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.765
See, you're a good guy.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.849
You have no idea
about the things I've done.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.777
You're a good guy.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.610
That's why you're gonna die today.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.071
It's why the baby is gonna die.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.624
Or...

16:01.795 --> 16:04.002
you can get in that car,

16:04.172 --> 16:06.254
get out of here,

16:06.424 --> 16:08.380
keep on being lucky.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.508
You think you're gonna kill me?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.179
Why haven't you killed me?

16:15.350 --> 16:18.012
How does having me alive
help you?

16:18.186 --> 16:20.393
Why the hell are you
even talking to me?

16:22.190 --> 16:26.650
Take her, take the car, and go.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.938
I don't want to do this today.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.489
(walkers snarling )

16:37.664 --> 16:41.156
Man: Backs to the walls
on either end of the car, now!

16:51.178 --> 16:53.510
(snarling )

17:40.101 --> 17:41.716
Move! Move!

17:41.895 --> 17:44.557
Help! Help! Help!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.711
( gunshots)

19:03.518 --> 19:06.635
( explosion )

19:06.813 --> 19:09.304
- Is that Terminus?
- Yeah.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.516
Probably.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.611
Maybe you're gonna win this.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.606
Maybe your friend--

19:19.784 --> 19:23.572
I mean,
maybe that woman

19:23.747 --> 19:25.453
just got capped.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.284
Maybe I'm gonna be the one
who gets capped when she comes back.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.499
Nobody's gotta die today.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.833
( scoffs )

19:35.008 --> 19:37.249
Man, if you believe that...

19:39.054 --> 19:41.010
then it's definitely
gonna be you and the kid.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.507
Even if that place
is burning to the ground.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.553
(gunfire)

19:51.649 --> 19:53.389
Man on radio:
Mary, what the hell was that?

19:54.903 --> 19:56.518
Mary, do you copy?

19:58.406 --> 19:59.907
- You stay here.
- These guys aren't going anywhere.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.157
Stay here until I know
what's happening!

20:03.286 --> 20:05.197
Man #2:
So we just sit here?

20:05.372 --> 20:07.408
Got a job to do.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.197
(grunting)

20:09.376 --> 20:11.082
(gunfire continues)

20:11.252 --> 20:12.708
(gasping )

20:12.879 --> 20:15.541
(snarling )

20:16.549 --> 20:18.540
Oh, Jesus.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.549
Man:
Get them!

20:22.722 --> 20:25.054
(snarling )

20:34.567 --> 20:37.229
(screaming )

20:49.207 --> 20:51.949
- You there, Gareth?
- He's busy.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.708
You smell the smoke?

20:53.878 --> 20:56.085
You hear the shots?
He could be dead.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.747
The hell we doing here?
The whole place could be going up.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.132
You went on one roundup
and you blew protocol.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.213
We don't deal with security.
That ain't ourjob.

21:03.388 --> 21:06.721
This is.
Hey, look at me.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.347
What?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.764
No, no, no, no!

21:16.359 --> 21:18.065
Glenn:
Rick!

21:27.287 --> 21:29.118
What the hell is going on?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.405
- Michonne: Someone hit them.
- Maybe our people got free.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.164
Excuse me.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.043
What the hell are you doing?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.465
I might be able to use this shell
to compromise the door.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.463
From the sound of things, there may
not be anybody left to open it.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.295
Eugene, I'm sorry,
but shut up.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.677
- Okay.
- Hey.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.339
My dad's gonna be back.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.138
- They all are.
- They are.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.770
And we need to get ready to fight
our way out with them when they do.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.580
(snarling )

22:20.340 --> 22:22.251
- Man: There's too many!
- ( woman screaming )

22:22.425 --> 22:24.666
(gunfire continues)

22:26.095 --> 22:28.632
(screaming )

22:55.333 --> 22:56.698
(gunshot)

23:02.298 --> 23:04.710
(snarling )

23:04.884 --> 23:07.921
If they got problems,
we got a chance.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.711
It sounded like a bomb.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.556
- Sounds like a damn war.
- Right there.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.432
What the hell are these people?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.343
They ain't people.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.354
Don't.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.231
Let him turn.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.242
Cross any of these people,
you kill them.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.032
Don't hesitate.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.831
They won't.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.294
(gunfire continues)

23:51.598 --> 23:55.261
( man screaming )

23:57.437 --> 23:59.723
Rick:
If we run, we can get by them.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.478
They're distracted.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.731
We got to let those people out.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.444
That's still who we are.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.571
It's got to be.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.862
Man:
Help me!

24:19.125 --> 24:20.626
Left flank.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.752
Man:
Help!

24:25.923 --> 24:28.380
Please help me!
Please!

24:28.551 --> 24:29.961
Come on, come on,
come on.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.169
We're the same!

24:34.182 --> 24:35.718
We're them!

24:35.892 --> 24:38.599
- Back off!
- We're the same.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.304
(snarling )

24:43.483 --> 24:45.189
Come on.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.318
(grunting)

25:04.962 --> 25:07.954
(gunfire)

25:43.334 --> 25:45.996
— ( gunfire continues)
_ ( people shouting )

25:46.170 --> 25:48.081
- We got to double back.
- Rick: A is that way.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.837
We go back,
we don't know where we are.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.543
We don't really have
a choice, do we?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.709
( gunshots)

25:59.267 --> 26:01.849
- Wait here.
- Rick. Rick!

26:14.073 --> 26:15.984
(snarling )

26:19.412 --> 26:22.620
- Man: Reloading!
-( people yelling)

26:36.679 --> 26:38.510
( groans )

26:45.563 --> 26:47.929
(walkers snarling )

26:52.445 --> 26:54.936
(woman screaming )

26:55.114 --> 26:57.491
(screaming )

27:00.119 --> 27:02.326
(screaming )

27:02.497 --> 27:04.658
We're gonna have to double back.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.824
(gunfire continues)

27:32.276 --> 27:34.983
- ( gun cocks)
- Drop your weapons and turn around.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.651
I want to see your face.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.407
(walkers snarling, pounding )

27:41.577 --> 27:43.442
Now!

28:05.518 --> 28:08.510
(grunting)

28:12.441 --> 28:14.181
Ah!

28:14.360 --> 28:17.022
( panting )

28:28.291 --> 28:30.031
The signs...

28:31.711 --> 28:33.372
they were real.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.958
It was a sanctuary.

28:38.259 --> 28:41.092
- People came and took this place.
- Just tell me where--

28:41.262 --> 28:44.880
And they raped and they killed

28:45.057 --> 28:49.721
and they laughed over weeks.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.807
But we got out

28:51.981 --> 28:54.393
and we fought
and we got it back.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.933
And we heard the message.

28:59.906 --> 29:03.899
You're the butcher...

29:04.076 --> 29:05.407
or you're the cattle.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.240
The men they pulled from that train car,
where are they?

29:14.670 --> 29:17.047
- ( screams )
- Where are they?

29:17.214 --> 29:19.421
(groaning)

29:25.181 --> 29:27.012
Now...

29:27.183 --> 29:30.641
point it at my head.

29:33.481 --> 29:35.437
(laughing)

29:35.608 --> 29:38.520
You could have been
one of us.

29:40.613 --> 29:44.026
You could have listened
to what the world is telling you.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.442
You lead people here and you take
what they have and you kill them?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.110
Is that what this place is?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.324
No, not at first.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.535
It's what it had to be.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.952
And we're still here.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.464
You're not here.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.255
Neither am |.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.393
(snarling )

30:18.567 --> 30:21.309
No!No!No!

30:21.487 --> 30:23.352
God! No, God!

30:23.531 --> 30:26.147
No! No!

30:28.828 --> 30:30.784
(walkers snarling )

30:39.588 --> 30:41.670
Back off!

30:41.841 --> 30:44.674
(crying)

30:44.844 --> 30:47.426
Back off!

30:47.596 --> 30:49.507
Put your weapons on the ground.
Kick them over right now.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.343
Right now!

30:56.772 --> 30:58.683
Ty reese:
Please.

31:02.695 --> 31:05.482
Please, don't hurt her.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.772
(crying)

31:07.950 --> 31:09.690
Go outside.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.952
Go outside!

31:13.122 --> 31:14.612
Just one twist, man.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.281
- Don't!
- Don't make me!

31:18.878 --> 31:22.041
(crying)

31:22.214 --> 31:23.920
Go outside.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.262
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

31:39.398 --> 31:41.013
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( Tyreese shouting )

31:41.192 --> 31:42.557
Cynthia, do you copy?

31:42.735 --> 31:44.225
(banging)

31:44.403 --> 31:46.189
Cynthia, do you copy?

31:46.363 --> 31:48.445
- ( pounding )
- ( Tyreese shouting )

31:48.616 --> 31:49.776
(pounding stops)

31:49.950 --> 31:52.737
(walker gurgling)

31:52.912 --> 31:55.619
(fussing )

32:10.137 --> 32:11.377
(grunts)

32:20.147 --> 32:23.605
Yeah.
That's how it works.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.732
I won't.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.234
(grunts)

32:28.781 --> 32:30.521
I won't!

32:30.699 --> 32:32.781
I won't!

32:32.952 --> 32:35.944
-( blows landing)
- Tyreese: I won't!

32:38.207 --> 32:39.196
I won't!

32:39.375 --> 32:41.616
(gunfire)

33:06.735 --> 33:09.351
What's the cure, Eugene?

33:10.364 --> 33:11.900
It's classified.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.274
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.488
Abraham:
You leave him be.

33:17.663 --> 33:21.622
- We need to keep working.
- Yeah, but it's time to hear it.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.168
'Cause we don't know
what's coming next.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.496
What's next is we get out of this.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.745
Even if I told you all,

33:27.923 --> 33:29.914
even if! provided
step-by-step instructions

33:30.092 --> 33:32.504
complete with illustrations
and a well-composed FAQ

33:32.678 --> 33:34.339
and I went red-ring...

33:35.514 --> 33:37.345
the cure would still
die with me.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.723
I'm not gonna let that happen.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.181
The best-case scenario,

33:43.355 --> 33:46.188
we step out into a hellstorm
of bullets, fire, and walkers.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.347
I'm not fleet of foot.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.982
I sure as hell can't take
a dead one down

33:49.153 --> 33:50.689
with sharp buttons
and hella confidence.

33:50.863 --> 33:54.321
Yeah, but we can and we will.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.700
You don't owe us anything.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.953
Not yet.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.034
But we just want to hear it.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.699
You don't have to.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.724
l was part of a 10-person team

34:22.895 --> 34:25.136
at the Human Genome Project
to weaponize diseases

34:25.314 --> 34:27.646
to fight weaponized diseases.

34:27.816 --> 34:32.355
Pathogenic microorganisms
with pathogenic microorganisms.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.269
Fire with fire.

34:34.448 --> 34:36.279
Interdepartmental drinks were had,

34:36.450 --> 34:38.657
relationships made,
information shared.

34:39.912 --> 34:43.120
I am keenly aware of all the details
behind fail-safe delivery systems

34:43.290 --> 34:45.576
to kill every living person
on this planet.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.117
I believe with a little tweaking
on the terminals in DC,

34:48.295 --> 34:49.876
we can flip the script.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.254
Take out every
last dead one of them.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.385
Fire with fire.

35:01.725 --> 35:05.513
All things being equal,
it does sound pretty badass.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.770
So let's get back to work.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.931
-( banging)
-(gaspS)

35:10.943 --> 35:13.605
Come on!
Fight to the fence!

35:14.822 --> 35:17.609
Abraham:
We do not leave his side!

35:17.783 --> 35:20.274
- Go, go, go!
- Carl!

35:21.412 --> 35:22.743
Let's go!

35:49.982 --> 35:51.347
(gunshot)

35:59.325 --> 36:00.485
Up and over.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.116
Abraham:
Let's go, let's go! Move!

36:11.837 --> 36:13.623
Abraham:
Let's go! Move!

36:15.174 --> 36:16.710
Rosita:
Come on!

36:34.568 --> 36:36.183
Right here.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.025
Abraham: The hell
are we still around here for?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.532
Rick:
Guns, some supplies.

36:43.702 --> 36:47.695
Go along the fences.
Use the rifles.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.534
Take out the rest of 'em.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.244
What?

36:51.418 --> 36:53.704
They don't get to live.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.713
Rick, we got out.
It's over.

37:00.511 --> 37:03.469
It's not over till they're all dead.

37:03.639 --> 37:06.381
The hell it isn't.
That place is on fire.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.718
Full of walkers.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.724
Abraham:
I'm not dicking around with this crap.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.726
We just made it out.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.762
The fences are down.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.556
They'll run or die.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.822
Did you do that?

38:11.457 --> 38:13.448
( laughs)

38:17.004 --> 38:18.414
Rick:
Thank you.

38:23.844 --> 38:25.800
You have to come with me.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.112
(crying)

39:00.464 --> 39:02.830
Judith.
You're okay.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.670
(sobbing )

39:22.069 --> 39:25.027
(no audible dialogue)

39:46.927 --> 39:48.542
(Judith crying)

39:48.720 --> 39:50.221
What happened?

39:50.389 --> 39:52.755
There were a bunch
of walkers out here

39:52.933 --> 39:55.595
and he got his hands
around Judith's neck.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.509
No, he's dead.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.180
|-- I had to.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.814
So I did.

40:03.819 --> 40:05.275
I could.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.733
I don't know if the fire
is still burning.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.414
It is.

40:18.792 --> 40:21.374
Yeah.
We need to go.

40:21.545 --> 40:22.910
Daryl:
Yeah, but where?

40:23.088 --> 40:25.079
Somewhere far away
from there.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.052
We'll talk to him.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.553
Not just yet.

41:30.781 --> 41:32.737
(whimpering)

41:32.908 --> 41:35.024
Alex:
Mom, Mom! Mom.

41:35.202 --> 41:38.410
( Mary gasping )

41:38.580 --> 41:40.491
No! No!

41:42.334 --> 41:43.699
Man:
That one.

41:43.877 --> 41:46.163
No, no, please.
Not again.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.169
(sobbing )
No! No!

41:48.340 --> 41:51.047
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

41:51.218 --> 41:53.504
- It's okay. It's okay.
- ( shrieks )

41:55.472 --> 41:57.838
No, it's not.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.677
( chuckles )

41:59.851 --> 42:01.842
( screams )

42:06.858 --> 42:10.066
- ( door shuts)
-( latch clangs )

42:11.113 --> 42:13.946
We're gonna take it back.

42:14.116 --> 42:15.697
How?

42:17.244 --> 42:18.905
We will.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.451
You're either the butcher
or the cattle.
