Hold up. Hold up.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.960
Someone was off key.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.960
Yeah. Who was it?

00:24.030 --> 00:24.960
Two hints:

00:25.030 --> 00:28.300
Robbie and Shapiro.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.130
My singing was not off.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.400
Man, your whole life is off.

00:32.470 --> 00:36.600
Well, I think maybe Tori was off key.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.010
Well.

00:38.070 --> 00:40.270
Tori wasn't off.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.380
You were perfect.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.110
Really nice tone.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.210
Handsome boy thinks I was perfect.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.650
Uh-uh! Not so fast.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.650
Let's talk about your homework assignment.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.490
For the full moon jam?

00:53.550 --> 00:54.350
Mm-hmm.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.620
You all have to do a song and
your performance will count

00:56.690 --> 00:58.360
as 1/3 of your semester grade.

00:58.430 --> 00:59.560
We have to sing a solo?

00:59.630 --> 01:01.630
It can be a solo, or you
can pair up with someone

01:01.700 --> 01:03.430
in this class and sing a duet.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.900

Ryder.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.680
I know your name. Ryder.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.890
So I was wondering if maybe you...
Well, I really can't sing

03:11.960 --> 03:12.660
a duet with you.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.920
No, that's not what I was gonna ask you.

03:14.990 --> 03:15.890
It's not?

03:15.960 --> 03:20.360
I was gonna see if maybe you
wanted to, you know, go out,

03:20.360 --> 03:25.770
or I should probably just...
No! Wait.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.710
I'd love to go out sometime,
and, wow, your arm is hard.

03:30.770 --> 03:31.310
Thanks.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.210
So we'll grab Sushi or something.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.510
Yes! I mean, yes.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.580
Yes. I want to do that.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.580
All right! Fine!

Oh! Hey, Tommy.

04:25.660 --> 04:26.430
Uh-oh.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.370
This didn't take long to go bad.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.530
I'm Robbie.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.570
Remember, I was in your jazz dance class?

04:33.640 --> 04:34.200
Oh, yeah.

04:34.270 --> 04:37.770
You're the kid who got kicked in the groin.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.410
Yes, uh, but I've healed.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.910
Anyway, I was just wondering if
maybe you'd wanna get dinner

04:43.980 --> 04:46.720
with me this Saturday night
at the olive bargain?

04:46.780 --> 04:50.090
Look, I would go out with
you, but I'd really rather

04:50.150 --> 04:54.720
just stay home and do nothing.

04:54.790 --> 04:55.890
I failed again.

04:55.960 --> 05:01.930
Aw. Who's inadequate?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.740
Hey. What's wrong with me?

05:05.800 --> 05:06.700
There's a bunch of things.

05:06.770 --> 05:07.100
Cheap.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.100
Just like a baby.

05:08.170 --> 05:08.870
A little awkward.

05:08.940 --> 05:09.810
You're irritating.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.910
You guys, it's not funny.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.710
Oh. Oh. And you're not funny.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.150
Oh, yay!

05:19.220 --> 05:21.980
Northstar. How can I assist you?

05:22.050 --> 05:25.590
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.360
Are you injured?

05:28.430 --> 05:31.390
And your location is?

05:31.460 --> 05:33.800
Okay. Help is on the way.

05:33.860 --> 05:39.000
Thanks for calling northstar.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.500
What was that about?

05:40.570 --> 05:42.840
You know the new phone
number I got last week?

05:42.910 --> 05:43.740
Uh-huh.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.640
Well, there must be a glitch or
something 'cause lots of people

05:46.710 --> 05:48.710
who have northstar keep calling me.

05:48.780 --> 05:49.980
Wait, I've heard of northstar.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.250
Isn't that, um... an emergency
service for people

05:52.320 --> 05:56.420
who've just had car accidents.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.120
Oh my God.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.360
It's so exciting.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.190
And I get to help people who need me.

06:01.260 --> 06:01.760
Yeah.

06:01.830 --> 06:05.290
But how will the paramedics
know to go help that guy?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.730
Oh my God. You're right.

06:06.800 --> 06:13.800
I should call the paramedics.

06:13.870 --> 06:14.970
Hey.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.840
Oh, someone's all happy about somethin yeah.
It's making me sick.

06:19.910 --> 06:20.910
Hey.

06:20.980 --> 06:24.780
Is there a reason why girls
don't wanna go out with me?

06:24.850 --> 06:27.550
You mean, like, one reason that stands out

06:27.620 --> 06:29.150
of all the other reasons?

06:29.220 --> 06:32.250
Ha!

06:32.320 --> 06:34.960
So why are you happy?

06:35.030 --> 06:38.390
'Cause Ryder Daniels asked me out.

06:38.460 --> 06:42.470
Ooh. He's hot.

06:42.530 --> 06:46.540
Stare all you want. I'm secure.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.100
I don't trust that Ryder guy.

06:48.170 --> 06:51.610
Oh, you just hate the idea of
anything good happening for me.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.780
That could not be more true.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.750
Well, I'm just saying, any
dude that hot and that perfect

06:57.810 --> 06:59.280
has to be hiding something.

06:59.350 --> 07:01.650
So I guess you think
Beck's hiding something.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.690
Oh, he was, until I found out.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.060
What was I hiding?

07:07.120 --> 07:11.130
That you were born in Canada!

07:11.190 --> 07:15.000
It wasn't a secret.

07:15.070 --> 07:19.100
So this Ryder guy, he just asked
you out and you said sure?

07:19.170 --> 07:21.440
Aah, yeah, pretty much.

07:21.510 --> 07:27.080
And he didn't give you a present or money?

07:27.140 --> 07:28.780
No.

07:28.850 --> 07:31.610
Well, I just don't understand.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.120
Wait. This date, when and where?

07:34.180 --> 07:35.650
Friday night, my house.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.190
Can I come?

07:37.250 --> 07:39.390
What... no! Why?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.020
'Cause I wanna learn from Ryder.

07:41.090 --> 07:43.090
Look, I wanna be the kind of
guy who can walk up to a girl,

07:43.160 --> 07:47.460
ask her out and not get
laughed at or sprayed.

07:47.530 --> 07:49.970
You can't observe my first date with Ryder.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.770
He won't even know I'm there.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.670
I'll hide in that bush on your patio.

07:54.740 --> 07:55.700
He'll see you.

07:55.770 --> 07:56.710
You never have.

07:56.770 --> 08:02.080
I know. But... what?

08:08.650 --> 08:12.890
Oh!

08:12.960 --> 08:14.990
Ooh.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.190
Trina, will you please help me?

08:17.260 --> 08:20.160
Busy.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.130
Are you making Sushi?

08:22.200 --> 08:25.670
Yeah. Will you just read me the
directions that are right over...

08:25.740 --> 08:33.179
Look, I just got these jeans
and I gotta stretch 'em out.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.610
You know, we eat on that table.

08:35.679 --> 08:41.419
Sorry, my butt's gotta breathe.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.290
And why make Sushi?

08:45.360 --> 08:49.120
I'm gonna surprise my date, Ryder Daniels.

08:49.190 --> 08:52.830
Ryder, senior guy, super hot?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.500
Be careful.

08:55.570 --> 08:56.400
Why?

08:56.470 --> 08:57.970
He dates lots of girls.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.540
You know my friend, Lindsey?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.640
Lindsey doesn't like you.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.940
So? I know her.

09:06.010 --> 09:08.810
Anyway, she went out with Ryder last year,

09:08.880 --> 09:11.110
and he totally broke her heart.

09:11.180 --> 09:11.950
He dumped her?

09:12.020 --> 09:15.680
Like with no warning, just, boom, over.

09:15.750 --> 09:20.160
Well, maybe he had a good reason.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.020
What is that?

09:22.090 --> 09:27.600
It's a spicy tuna ball.

09:30.300 --> 09:35.400
I just made tuna into balls. They are spicy.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.530
Feeling: Hungry.

09:51.350 --> 09:57.590
So how's your spicy tuna ball?

09:57.660 --> 10:00.000
I've never had Sushi like this before.

10:00.060 --> 10:04.770
Aw. Thank you.

10:04.830 --> 10:05.700
So listen.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.370
Mm-hmm.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.940
I gotta ask you something.

10:09.010 --> 10:11.240
Hit me.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.370
Okay.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.440
So we've been on the same class all year.

10:14.510 --> 10:15.210
Uh-huh.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.180
And we've like never
even talked or anything

10:17.250 --> 10:19.680
and then you just ask me out.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.350
All true.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.750
Why?

10:22.820 --> 10:23.320
I don't know.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.690
I guess I was nervous to talk to you.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.790
But that's insane.

10:27.860 --> 10:34.660
You're all hot and stuff, Mr.
Hard muscles.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.770
What about you, Ms.
Cheekbones?

10:36.830 --> 10:39.230
Stop.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.900
No, I mean, come on, you're pretty.

10:40.970 --> 10:43.110
You're an amazing singer.

10:43.170 --> 10:50.580
You can make whatever this is.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.850
Oh hey, do you have a bathroom?

10:51.920 --> 10:55.520
Yeah, through there,
first door on your left.

10:55.590 --> 10:56.990
Thanks.

10:57.050 --> 11:03.690
Sure.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.160
Hey.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.730
Where did you come from?

11:07.800 --> 11:08.830
Have you been eavesdropping?

11:08.900 --> 11:11.700
Yes. Check his phone.

11:11.770 --> 11:12.400
What?

11:12.470 --> 11:12.770
Shh.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.800
You don't have much time.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.040
Boys pee fast.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.710
Check his phone.

11:16.770 --> 11:17.840
For what?

11:17.910 --> 11:19.340
You could always find
out a person's secrets

11:19.410 --> 11:20.680
by checking their phone.

11:20.740 --> 11:21.910
But... hurry.

11:21.980 --> 11:40.230
I don't want...
Oh.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.200
Help you find something?

11:43.270 --> 11:46.030
Wow, you guys do pee fast.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.200
Were you reading my text messages?

11:48.270 --> 11:49.410
No.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.080
Dude!

11:54.140 --> 11:54.980
I'm sorry.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.280
Okay. I was snooping.

11:56.350 --> 11:59.210
Wow, we've been going
out for like 46 minutes

11:59.280 --> 12:00.820
d you already don't trust me.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.250
No, no. I'm not like that.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.520
Are you sure?

12:03.590 --> 12:07.660
'Cause I think maybe
you're exactly like that.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.390
No, don't pick up your jacket.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.330
I gotta go.

12:11.390 --> 12:16.400
But what about your spicy tuna balls?

12:16.470 --> 12:25.970
I'll see you later.

12:26.040 --> 12:32.110
Did that bush just waddle?

12:32.180 --> 12:34.120
Robbie Shapiro!

12:34.180 --> 12:36.420
Yes?

12:36.490 --> 12:38.290
You're invading my privacy.

12:38.350 --> 12:41.890
Hey, at least I didn't snoop
through Ryder's phone.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.060
Go!

12:43.170 --> 12:45.020
Yeah!

12:47.560 --> 12:53.600
Looking for a certain boy. My donut tastes weird.

12:53.600 --> 12:59.980
Feeling: Searchy.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.350
Hey, you guys seen Ryder Daniels?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.180
Not today.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.050
You mean the hottie?

13:08.120 --> 13:12.320
Ha, I see him.

13:12.390 --> 13:13.990
Ryder, listen.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.960
Yes.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.430
Eew, Robbie. What did you do?

13:19.490 --> 13:22.730
I realized that a guy like Ryder
gets girls because of his looks

13:22.800 --> 13:26.570
and his attitude, so I
make-overed myself.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.000
Your ear is bleeding.

13:29.070 --> 13:29.770
I know.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.440
I tried to Pierce it like Ryder's.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.040
Ryder doesn't have a pierced ear.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.880
You said you were sure his ear was pierced.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.750
Yeah, I was kidding.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.850
Hi.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.680
Hey, Cat.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.120
Hey, after school do you guys wanna like...

13:45.320 --> 13:48.220
Oh yay, another one.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.860
Northstar, how may I assist you?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.260
Another car accident?

13:52.330 --> 13:54.430
Yeah.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.100
I'm sorry, sir.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.000
Can you say that again?

13:56.060 --> 13:58.400
I can't understand you.

13:58.470 --> 14:03.600
You need an ambu-what?

14:03.670 --> 14:04.200
I'm sorry.

14:04.270 --> 14:05.410
I can't understand you.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.710
Who is she talking to?

14:06.780 --> 14:07.980
Ooh, pretty girl.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.010
Wait. Miss, have you
noticed my new appearance?

14:11.080 --> 14:14.980
Ma'am, wait!

14:15.050 --> 14:17.450
Ryder.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.490
Hey.

14:18.550 --> 14:21.160
Hey, did you get my text messages?

14:21.220 --> 14:25.330
Yeah... you wanna check my phone
to make sure I'm not lying?

14:25.390 --> 14:26.530
I'm sorry.

14:26.590 --> 14:29.300
I was so wrong to snoop on your
phone and if you'll just give me

14:29.360 --> 14:31.800
another chance, I promise, I will trust you

14:31.870 --> 14:34.940
and I will never ever, ever
give you spicy tuna balls

14:35.000 --> 14:40.870
ever again.

14:40.940 --> 14:45.110
I kinda like the spicy tuna balls.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.720
So you wanna come over tonight?

14:47.780 --> 14:48.580
I can't.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.250
I gotta pick a song for the full moon jam.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.450
I gotta start rehearsing it.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.420
Aw.

14:52.490 --> 14:57.390
I gotta, and I don't even know
what song I'm gonna do yet.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.060
You don't?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.830
No.

14:59.890 --> 15:04.030
I just... I get so scared to sing alone.

15:04.100 --> 15:10.500
Well, maybe we could do a song
together, a little duet action.

15:10.570 --> 15:13.740
That sounds nice.

15:13.810 --> 15:17.340
You make me feel safe.

15:17.410 --> 15:19.950
Hey, do you guys know if
it's possible for a man

15:20.010 --> 15:23.620
to perform cpr on himself?

15:23.690 --> 15:24.620
I don't think so.

15:24.690 --> 15:25.620
I doubt it.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.920
Yeah, me too.

15:27.990 --> 15:31.660
Sir, I'm sorry to keep you waiting
so long but my supervisor

15:31.730 --> 15:34.930
says it's impossible for
you to give yourself cpr.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.600
Okay?

15:37.670 --> 15:44.940
Hello? Hello?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:17.640 --> 16:18.270
What?

16:18.340 --> 16:19.740
Are you about to kiss me?

16:19.810 --> 16:21.740
Yeah.

16:21.810 --> 16:28.050
Okay.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.420
Sorry.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.790
It's cool.

16:32.850 --> 16:33.790
Did I bite your lip?

16:33.860 --> 16:37.720
Little bit.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.490
Hey, Christine. Wait up.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.360
Hi.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.530
Uh, Robbie?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.000
Right. Right, yeah.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.670
I'm in your Spanish class.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.070
You look different.

16:48.140 --> 16:53.540
I know. Try to relax.

16:53.610 --> 16:56.440
You know, you kinda look like
this guy I used to date.

16:56.510 --> 16:57.410
Who?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.480
Ryder Daniels.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.580
Oh, you dated him?

17:00.650 --> 17:03.350
Well, I thought I was dating
him, then I found out

17:03.420 --> 17:04.349
his little game.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.390
Keep going.

17:06.450 --> 17:07.150
Okay.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.420
So Ryder talked me into dancing with him

17:09.490 --> 17:12.890
for a class project, you know,
'cause I'm a good dancer,

17:12.960 --> 17:14.760
and then right after I
helped him get an "a,"

17:14.829 --> 17:16.560
he never called me again.

17:16.630 --> 17:20.470
Oh, you must have felt so dirty.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.770
Nah, he does it to a lot of girls.

17:22.839 --> 17:26.010
He uses them to get a
good grade, then see ya,

17:26.069 --> 17:27.910
but I should have known.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.440
No guys ever ask me out.

17:30.510 --> 17:34.350
I just sit home alone.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.050
So depressing.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.950
Well, uh, do you wanna go out with me?

17:40.020 --> 17:48.160
No.

17:48.230 --> 17:49.700
And then Robbie told us.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.700
So we checked it out with
some of the other girls.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.230
Ryder's gone out with.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.600
And it's true.

17:55.670 --> 18:02.140
So he's just using me to get a good grade?

18:02.210 --> 18:05.080
Sorry, Tori.

18:05.150 --> 18:10.550
You must feel pretty stupid right now.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.320
Okay, that's a time-out.

18:12.390 --> 18:24.260
No, I was just trying
to... go sit on the steps.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.030
So what do I do now?

18:26.100 --> 18:29.540
Well, you're not still gonna sing
a duet with that jerk, right?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.840
No way.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.610
Good. So he'll fail.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.580
Yeah, but I don't wanna fail too.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.010
So what are you gonna sing?

18:38.080 --> 18:41.180
A song, a really cool song that
you're gonna help me write

18:41.250 --> 18:42.050
tonight.

18:42.120 --> 18:42.680
I can't.

18:42.750 --> 18:43.520
You have to.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.450
But I got to go... come on, Andre.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.220
All right.

18:46.290 --> 18:49.120
I'll just celebrate my 97-year-old
great-grandpa's birthday

18:49.190 --> 18:51.600
with him next year, possibly.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.300
Well, come on.

18:58.260 --> 19:04.010
Sometimes it's nice to forgive people.
And other times, revenge rocks.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.730
Feeling: Feisty.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.350
♪ Goodbye, my coney isle ♪

19:11.410 --> 19:13.910
♪ goodbye, my coney isle ♪

19:13.980 --> 19:17.350
♪ goodbye, my coney isle ♪

19:17.420 --> 19:18.750
I got your mic for you.

19:18.820 --> 19:20.120
Just put it on me.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.120
Sure.

19:22.190 --> 19:24.120
So congrats, man.

19:24.190 --> 19:24.830
About what?

19:24.890 --> 19:27.060
I hear you're going out with Tori.

19:27.130 --> 19:32.230
Yeah, for like five more minutes,
then you can have her.

19:32.300 --> 19:37.540
Really?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.410
Okay, up next, we have, singing a duet,

19:40.480 --> 19:48.850
Tori Vega and Ryder Daniels.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.350
Come on.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.320
Hey, you guys.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.050
Hi.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.820
Okay, this is a little song for the ladies,

19:55.890 --> 19:58.490
especially for the ones who
know my friend, Ryder.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.380
My mic is not working.

20:00.380 --> 20:01.700
Bummer.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.270
Let's go Andre.

20:04.510 --> 20:06.040
Andre?

20:08.490 --> 20:10.430
Oh... what song is this?

20:10.430 --> 20:12.860
Just listen. I think you'll hate it!

20:14.990 --> 20:21.950
You had it all the day you
told me told me you want me

20:22.400 --> 20:28.930
I had it all but let you
fool me fool me completely

20:29.580 --> 20:37.020
I was so stupid to give
you all my attention

20:37.020 --> 20:44.070
cause the way you played me
exposed your true intention

20:44.070 --> 20:51.220
and one day I'll have you begging on your knees for me

20:51.720 --> 21:00.770
one day I'll have you crawling
like a centipede you mess with me

21:00.770 --> 21:06.190
and mess with her so I'll make
sure you get what you deserve

21:06.190 --> 21:16.080
one day you'll be begging on your
knees for me so watch your back

21:16.080 --> 21:20.700
cause you don't know where or when I could get you

21:21.250 --> 21:24.970
I set the trap and when I am done

21:24.970 --> 21:27.730
you will know what I have been through

21:29.120 --> 21:36.370
oh, mister player do you feel like a man now

21:36.370 --> 21:43.350
I bet that you are nervous cause this song makes you freak out

21:44.020 --> 21:48.030
I know I'm being bitter but
I'm gonna drive you under

21:48.030 --> 21:51.650
cause you just don't, don't don't
deserve a happy ever after

21:51.650 --> 21:54.720
cause of what you did
to me after you told me

21:54.720 --> 22:04.200
you never felt that way
and it's only just a game

22:07.250 --> 22:09.330
and one day...

22:12.670 --> 22:18.330
I'll have you begging on your
knees for me you mess with me

22:18.330 --> 22:23.750
and mess with her so I'll make
sure you get what you deserve

22:23.750 --> 22:32.560
one day you'll begging on your knees for me

22:35.870 --> 22:37.210
ouch.

22:40.260 --> 22:45.150
You just got loose.
