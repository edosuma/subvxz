00:45.269 --> 00:47.046
So, how did
Malt Liquor Mommy die?

00:47.107 --> 00:49.148
Stop calling her that.

00:49.334 --> 00:50.742
I'll tell you
how she died.

00:50.901 --> 00:51.845
You know that sign that says

00:51.900 --> 00:53.454
"Do not stand up
on the roller coaster"?

00:53.575 --> 00:54.246
Yeah.

00:54.302 --> 00:55.135
She overdosed

00:55.230 --> 00:56.004
right in front of it.

00:56.206 --> 00:58.075
Oh. Class all the way.

00:58.206 --> 01:00.241
Marge, could
you let it go?

01:00.362 --> 01:02.019
You won. She's dead.

01:02.077 --> 01:02.873
Mm-hmm.

01:03.056 --> 01:05.193
We are here
to mourn the tragic loss

01:05.206 --> 01:07.271
of Amber Pai Gow Simpson,

01:07.356 --> 01:08.913
a gifted cocktail waitress

01:08.985 --> 01:10.311
who hoped one day

01:10.357 --> 01:12.263
to learn computers.

01:15.397 --> 01:16.911
Amber said she wouldn't let

01:16.926 --> 01:18.653
her eighth-grade education

01:18.716 --> 01:19.502
stop her from

01:19.518 --> 01:20.900
achieving her dreams

01:21.317 --> 01:22.582
And yet, it did.

01:23.997 --> 01:26.131
Bart! Do you want
to leave the funeral early?!

01:26.248 --> 01:26.781
Do you?!

01:26.938 --> 01:28.182
Yes. Of course.

01:29.635 --> 01:30.802
"You were Homer's wife

01:30.905 --> 01:32.020
"for a two-day spurt

01:32.305 --> 01:33.370
Your name was Amber,

01:33.516 --> 01:34.512
just like the alert..."

01:36.946 --> 01:38.801
Bart, put that away!

01:39.056 --> 01:40.550
Thanks a lot. I lost my place

01:40.936 --> 01:43.542
Um... Ah, here it is. "The end."

01:48.835 --> 01:49.202
Uh-oh.

01:53.418 --> 01:54.471
Everyone relax, huh?

01:54.608 --> 01:56.843
I know the Heimlich.
I learned it a few years ago.

01:56.957 --> 01:58.371
It was 1997,

01:58.486 --> 02:01.540
and Titanic was proving
unsinkable at the box office...

02:05.016 --> 02:05.891
Somebody do me!

02:10.797 --> 02:11.253
Whew!

02:25.348 --> 02:27.223
Your son is
out of control!

02:27.258 --> 02:29.512
You've raised
a savage beast!

02:29.627 --> 02:31.260
Yeah! Put a leash
on him, lady!

02:31.565 --> 02:32.552
Oh...

02:35.635 --> 02:37.702
First, let me assure you
that Bart's antics

02:37.707 --> 02:39.872
are perfectly normal
for a seven-year-old.

02:39.968 --> 02:41.901
Actually, he's ten.

02:42.057 --> 02:42.623
Oh, dear.

02:43.007 --> 02:43.811
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.

02:43.958 --> 02:46.140
Spare us your
medical mumbo jumbo.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.713
Just give us the pills.

02:47.846 --> 02:50.133
Clear-cut his brain
down to the nub

02:50.426 --> 02:50.923
Mr. Simpson,

02:50.937 --> 02:53.942
it would be easy for me
to pour drugs

02:54.007 --> 02:54.601
Thank you,

02:54.645 --> 02:55.071
Doctor.

02:55.236 --> 02:55.700
Marge?

02:55.867 --> 02:57.322
But for Bart,

02:57.398 --> 02:58.451
I'm ing to prescribe

02:58.478 --> 03:00.502
a more unorthodox treatment.

03:02.268 --> 03:04.230
Cymbals... snare...

03:04.327 --> 03:06.272
high hat... tom-tom...

03:06.338 --> 03:07.873
sticks, mallet and brushes.

03:08.047 --> 03:09.261
This is a drum kit!

03:09.456 --> 03:10.943
Drumming demands energy

03:10.986 --> 03:11.811
and concentration,

03:12.016 --> 03:13.343
one of which Bart has,

03:19.497 --> 03:20.552
Homie, look.

03:20.595 --> 03:22.242
He's enjoying it.

03:52.345 --> 03:53.352
Whoa! Trippy!

04:05.117 --> 04:06.082
We started living

04:06.117 --> 04:07.760
in an old house 

04:08.477 --> 04:09.613
 My ma gave birth,

04:09.625 --> 04:11.370
and we were checking it out 

04:11.436 --> 04:13.032
 It was a baby boy

04:13.106 --> 04:14.912
so we bought him a toy... 

04:16.987 --> 04:18.351
Hey, kid, why don't
you watch where

04:18.387 --> 04:19.132
you're drumming?!

04:19.237 --> 04:20.372
Sorry, White Stripes.

04:20.526 --> 04:21.351
No hard feelings?

04:22.277 --> 04:23.531
Let's kick his ass!

04:51.976 --> 04:54.163
Oh!  Why couldn't
he give up this

04:54.195 --> 04:56.112
like he gives up
everything else?

04:56.146 --> 04:56.861
I know!

04:57.017 --> 04:58.860
I'll use that
white-noise machine

04:58.917 --> 05:00.743
I got you when your father died.

05:02.685 --> 05:06.333
Transport yourself to the shores
of Nova Scotia

05:06.546 --> 05:09.223
where cod and halibut
frolic in...!

05:09.297 --> 05:11.721
He's just drumming louder!

05:11.828 --> 05:14.283
So it's a noise war
he wants, huh?!

05:14.508 --> 05:17.371
Then I'll throw in some
rush-hour traffic!

05:19.628 --> 05:21.900
And a circus fire!

05:24.165 --> 05:26.820
Sleep tight, my angel!

05:27.007 --> 05:28.101
Oh...

05:28.175 --> 05:29.501
What ?!

05:29.568 --> 05:30.892
Oh !

05:31.337 --> 05:33.931
Oh! Let me know...

05:34.115 --> 05:38.601
when and if
you want sex, honey!

05:44.526 --> 05:47.452
Oh, he's gotta fall asleep

05:47.458 --> 05:49.492
sometime, doesn't he?

05:54.028 --> 05:56.002
You guys
need a break

05:56.068 --> 05:57.532
Why don't I take Bart with me

05:57.558 --> 05:59.241
to the children's bebop brunch

05:59.306 --> 06:00.553
at Jazzy Goodtime's?

06:00.576 --> 06:02.312
Is it in
a safe neighborhood?

06:03.236 --> 06:04.430
Just make it happen!

06:05.767 --> 06:06.841
Boy, get dressed!

06:07.056 --> 06:08.260
You're going
to a jazz brunch

06:08.328 --> 06:10.860
as punishment for all
the racket you're making!

06:10.988 --> 06:12.852
I thought you wanted me to drum.

06:13.048 --> 06:16.132
I'm sending you mixed messages.

06:16.365 --> 06:17.551
Now, get the hell
outta here.

06:19.136 --> 06:21.042
I love you so much.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.182
Damn you!

06:42.885 --> 06:44.403
What it is, hepcats?

06:44.506 --> 06:46.331
You want me to
scat-sing the menu?

06:46.395 --> 06:47.452
Absolutely not.

06:47.605 --> 06:48.823
Oh, God bless you, sir.

06:49.648 --> 06:51.550
Hey, Bart, you want
to jam with me?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.443
Okay. If you give
me your omelet.

06:54.026 --> 06:55.932
Whoo-hoo! I'm
a professional musician!

07:15.496 --> 07:17.570
Not bad for
a newbie, Bart!

07:17.657 --> 07:20.423
You just may be
the second-best

07:20.466 --> 07:23.571
In case you're wondering
who the best one it's me.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.231
Ah! Crazy man, crazy! Oh, yeah!

07:38.526 --> 07:40.300
 They're looking at me!

07:40.378 --> 07:42.202
 All right, Lisa, time to show

07:42.266 --> 07:43.440
  these jazz legends

07:43.498 --> 07:45.501
 how we swing in the suburbs.

07:51.075 --> 07:52.272
That's  a wrap, kids.

07:52.308 --> 07:54.230
Now go have
some Jazzy Bread.

07:54.527 --> 07:56.392
That's bread that fell
on the floor.

07:58.408 --> 07:58.842
Excuse me.

07:58.868 --> 08:00.010
Are you Lisa Simpson?

08:00.966 --> 08:02.520
Yes, I am.

08:03.296 --> 08:03.982
I'm, uh,

08:04.168 --> 08:06.140
Defonzo "Skinny" Palmer

08:06.227 --> 08:09.250
This is Marcus
"Marbles" Le Marquez.

08:09.328 --> 08:10.790
Pleased to meet you.

08:11.086 --> 08:14.101
We were about
to play a quick set,

08:14.128 --> 08:14.510
Yes ?

08:14.607 --> 08:15.510
Lisa Simpson...

08:15.536 --> 08:15.953
Yes?

08:16.017 --> 08:17.192
would do us the honor...

08:17.252 --> 08:17.809
Yes?

08:17.907 --> 08:18.963
of sitting in...

08:19.816 --> 08:21.273
 that chair in the audience.

08:21.357 --> 08:22.722
We wanna jam
with your brother.

08:55.738 --> 08:57.702
Look! Bart's onstage.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.873
And he's contributing
to the entertainment!

09:01.196 --> 09:02.033
Yeah!

09:05.727 --> 09:08.373
I was jamming
with Skinny Turner

09:08.467 --> 09:10.393
And they want me
to join their trio!

09:10.428 --> 09:11.650
Woo-hoo! What's next?

09:11.747 --> 09:13.490
A contract with
Groove-tone Records?

09:13.708 --> 09:14.941
Take the G-train, baby.

09:15.007 --> 09:15.842
Groove-tone!

09:18.925 --> 09:21.692
Oh, I can't believe it.
Stupid brother...

09:24.855 --> 09:28.080
'Cause I've wanted to jam with
jazz musicians all my life.

09:28.238 --> 09:31.180
How would Bart like it if I
just hopped on his skateboard

09:31.245 --> 09:32.683
and instantly became great?

09:34.826 --> 09:36.961
Ah... whoa...

09:42.545 --> 09:44.222
Mild! Mild! Mild! Mild! Mild!

09:49.586 --> 09:52.533
Lisa, you've got
to be more careful.

09:52.538 --> 09:54.551
I need you to teach me
all about the world of juzz.

09:55.358 --> 09:56.523
It's jazz!

09:56.746 --> 09:57.493
Jazz!

09:59.105 --> 10:02.742
You don't even know
the name of the thing

10:03.685 --> 10:07.200
Bart, you're so steady
on those skins, we're

10:07.325 --> 10:10.173
Oh-- I always
wanted a jazz nickname.

10:10.238 --> 10:10.613
Fine

10:10.655 --> 10:11.551
We'll call you, uh...

10:11.646 --> 10:12.221
Downbeat.

10:12.418 --> 10:13.900
'Cause you're
bringin' us down.

10:15.098 --> 10:17.580
That is the most unfair...

10:17.637 --> 10:18.763
Downbeat, Downbeat,
please.

10:18.907 --> 10:20.153
We're shootin' the breeze
with Tic Tock.

10:20.735 --> 10:23.363
Oh, man, I am so juzzed.

10:29.048 --> 10:31.641
Bart, a rising star like
you needs a manager,

10:31.665 --> 10:34.123
and Gil's your guy!
Oh, I'm a jazz daddy

10:34.135 --> 10:34.962
from way back.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.031
With the skit-skat
skittily boom-de-boom,

10:37.038 --> 10:38.742
and the ding-dong daddy...

10:38.855 --> 10:39.941
Is that jazz?

10:39.967 --> 10:41.073
That's jazz, right?

10:41.288 --> 10:43.600
Cha-cha-cha
with the curly fries.

10:46.245 --> 10:46.872
Hey!

10:48.676 --> 10:49.921
Oh, son.

10:50.206 --> 10:54.013
I like you more, now that
other people like you.

10:54.198 --> 10:56.493
It's mergatronic, Daddy-Ho.

10:56.528 --> 10:58.253
Bart, does that
even mean anything?

10:58.388 --> 10:59.743
Xavier Cugat!

11:07.277 --> 11:09.182
Bossie, the music business would

11:09.225 --> 11:11.231
chew you up and spit you out.

11:11.408 --> 11:12.672
You just keep your eyes

11:12.687 --> 11:14.222
on the prize, girl.

11:17.447 --> 11:18.852
Mom, I'm gonna lose it.

11:18.975 --> 11:21.762
Bart's on the cover of both
local jazz magazines:

11:21.868 --> 11:22.291
"Blowin'"

11:22.505 --> 11:23.662
and "The Sugar Sheet".

11:24.336 --> 11:26.410
Here's the only thing I've
been on the cover of.

11:33.115 --> 11:36.163
Mm, look, uh, how 'bout
we go to the pound,

11:36.208 --> 11:38.021
and get puppy
just for you?

11:40.298 --> 11:41.561
That might work.

11:43.726 --> 11:45.542
Oh, they're all so cute.

11:45.837 --> 11:47.031
Yeah, you know
what's even cuter?

11:47.227 --> 11:48.742
Picking one without
talking to me.

11:49.128 --> 11:50.660
Well, I kind of like this guy.

11:56.368 --> 11:58.812
Oh, but this one is precious!

12:06.428 --> 12:08.573
Okay, this little guy's
coming home with me.

12:10.287 --> 12:12.172
Who's gonna get neutered
tomorrow?

12:12.208 --> 12:14.972
You are! Oh, yes you are.

12:21.347 --> 12:22.140
Lisa Simpson...

12:22.355 --> 12:24.002
you doomed me.

12:24.068 --> 12:25.801
I did? How?

12:26.028 --> 12:27.640
By choosing the cuter puppy.

12:27.757 --> 12:29.663
You picked looks over
personality,

12:29.766 --> 12:31.211
youth over experience,

12:31.348 --> 12:32.830
no history of rabies over

12:32.835 --> 12:34.391
unknown rabies status.

12:34.498 --> 12:36.160
And now I'm going to die.

12:36.237 --> 12:37.991
I never wanted that to happen!

12:38.057 --> 12:41.202
You suuuuuck! You suuuuuck!

12:44.447 --> 12:45.390
Ah, thanks, sweetie.

12:45.638 --> 12:47.632
You suuuuuck!

12:47.737 --> 12:49.111
Well, if you want him,
you can have him.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.821
And if you
get tired of him...

12:53.667 --> 12:54.911
I won't get tired of him.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.920
It's just too bad
you can't take ol' Smiley here.

12:59.376 --> 13:01.751
Yeah, he'll be in God's
Dumpster tomorrow

13:03.315 --> 13:04.412
I'll take him, too.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.623
And I'm gonna put
ol' Henry here to sleep...

13:06.796 --> 13:09.052
because he knows
my darkest secret:

13:09.557 --> 13:11.342
I like putting animals to sleep.

13:12.718 --> 13:14.290
I'll take him, too.

13:26.815 --> 13:28.061
 Yeah... 

13:33.527 --> 13:36.873
Lookin' back on the track
for a little green bag 

13:36.925 --> 13:41.471
Got  to find just the kind
or losin' my mind 

13:42.707 --> 13:46.531
Out of sight in the night,
out of sight in the day 

13:47.336 --> 13:50.683
Lookin' back on the track,
gonna do it my way

14:07.866 --> 14:08.902
Okay, guys.

14:08.997 --> 14:12.100
No one knows you're here,
so be quiet.

14:12.137 --> 14:13.671
And if you get hungry,

14:13.818 --> 14:17.281
there are rats living in
the Christmas decorations.

14:23.117 --> 14:24.560
And then today at lunch,

14:24.567 --> 14:27.310
Lenny and I went to the park
and rented a rowboat.

14:27.525 --> 14:28.991
Carl sketched us from the bank.

14:29.526 --> 14:30.653
Summer days...

14:34.228 --> 14:35.813
What are
those noises?

14:35.967 --> 14:37.741
They sounded
zoological.

14:41.987 --> 14:42.993
Shut up!

14:43.096 --> 14:44.560
I just said "shut up."

14:44.686 --> 14:46.441
I'll punish myself
by going upstairs.

14:50.346 --> 14:52.270
Bart! What are you doing here?

14:52.375 --> 14:54.321
Uh... not smoking reefer.

14:54.588 --> 14:55.332
Uh, that's right.

14:55.385 --> 14:57.111
We all not
smoking reefer.

15:03.595 --> 15:05.420
No, Buttercup! No!

15:06.805 --> 15:09.200
My arm!
It hurts where

15:15.596 --> 15:17.493
Bart, that was
a nasty bite you got.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.571
You'll recover...

15:18.747 --> 15:20.741
but you'll never drum again.

15:20.945 --> 15:21.662
Says you.

15:24.935 --> 15:26.282
I was a great drummer,

15:26.326 --> 15:27.543
and now I'm nothing,

15:27.707 --> 15:29.462
just like Phil Collins.

15:29.617 --> 15:31.200
I feel so terrible.

15:31.296 --> 15:33.321
I just wanted
to save those animals

15:33.376 --> 15:35.051
while Bart
became a drummer,

15:35.158 --> 15:37.242
but I never thought the two

15:37.296 --> 15:39.022
stories would intersect.

15:39.197 --> 15:41.843
And what about my new job
as a Mexican wrestler?

15:41.965 --> 15:44.700
Beware of Taco Belly. Whoo!

15:44.796 --> 15:45.751
Eat  your heart...

15:48.016 --> 15:48.940
 No mas! No mas!

15:55.706 --> 15:59.792
Uh, yes, I would like a bird
because I'm often

16:01.247 --> 16:02.141
Birds help.

16:04.076 --> 16:05.001
See, Lisa.

16:05.038 --> 16:06.602
We're making progress.

16:06.725 --> 16:08.252
Drop the marsupial!

16:08.765 --> 16:11.383
If those animals aren't gone
by midnight tomorrow,

16:11.446 --> 16:13.462
Animal Control is
gonna round 'em all up.

16:15.246 --> 16:15.730
And kill 'em.

16:21.988 --> 16:23.980
Can I, uh, can I
borrow that ostrich?

16:24.188 --> 16:24.861
Sure.

16:29.265 --> 16:30.522
How cool is this?

16:32.416 --> 16:33.540
I guess that's it.

16:34.278 --> 16:36.271
These animals are all gonna die.

16:36.507 --> 16:38.332
Not if I can
help it, Lisa.

16:38.488 --> 16:39.571
Do you have an idea?

16:39.815 --> 16:42.032
Uh, no. Sorry if it
sounded like I did.

16:47.727 --> 16:49.522
Hey, guys,
great news.

16:49.848 --> 16:51.122
I can drum again.

17:00.536 --> 17:01.361
Sorry, Tic Tock.

17:01.558 --> 17:02.541
Your tick is on...

17:02.586 --> 17:04.099
but your tock is gone.

17:04.377 --> 17:06.732
Well, I've got
a confession to make.

17:06.906 --> 17:10.112
This right arm... it's not mine.

17:10.267 --> 17:10.821
Whose is it?

17:10.886 --> 17:11.821
I don't know.

17:15.547 --> 17:17.391
Tic Tock, maybe you
could get yourself

17:17.438 --> 17:19.069
some of that sweet, sweet...

17:19.907 --> 17:20.713
what do you call it?

17:20.915 --> 17:24.410
Arthroscopic
micro-surgery

17:24.457 --> 17:25.721
Yeah, that's
the jingle.

17:25.807 --> 17:28.111
The doctor did say
surgery might help,

17:28.224 --> 17:30.852
but it costs $78,000.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.802
Well, I bet we
could raise it

17:33.898 --> 17:34.683
Huh? Huh?

17:34.826 --> 17:35.573
Outta sight!

17:35.605 --> 17:36.270
In the pocket!

17:36.316 --> 17:38.361
Groovay, groovay!

17:38.435 --> 17:40.400
Now, you boys know
you don't have

17:40.446 --> 17:41.833
to put something
like that together.

17:41.887 --> 17:42.891
Somethin' like what together?

17:43.027 --> 17:44.133
A benefit concert!

17:44.218 --> 17:45.323
Benefit concert!?

17:45.486 --> 17:46.630
Outta sight!

17:46.687 --> 17:47.571
In the pocket!

17:47.638 --> 17:49.703
Groovay, groovay!

17:52.578 --> 17:55.673
Oh, this benefit concert
is gonna be Scooby Dooby.

17:56.035 --> 17:58.461
I'm very happy for you, Bart.

17:59.857 --> 18:00.850
Why are you sad?

18:01.105 --> 18:02.163
Thinking about your marriage?

18:02.516 --> 18:05.093
If we can't find
a home for those animals,

18:05.135 --> 18:06.402
they'll be put to sleep.

18:06.527 --> 18:08.731
Your sister's very upset.

18:08.915 --> 18:10.752
Oh... I feel weird.

18:10.876 --> 18:12.891
It's like a potato
chip full of shame,

18:13.057 --> 18:14.752
going down my throat sideways.

18:14.898 --> 18:17.552
Honey, what you're feeling
is called "empathy."

18:17.675 --> 18:19.722
Oh... now I'm gonna
learn a new word.

18:19.887 --> 18:22.350
"Empathy" means
you're looking at Lisa

18:22.487 --> 18:24.801
and feeling what she feels.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.331
Your sister poured her heart

18:26.348 --> 18:28.181
into rescuing those animals

18:28.296 --> 18:29.723
to forget the pain of

18:29.747 --> 18:31.750
being upstaged in jazz,

18:32.006 --> 18:32.790
and now...

18:36.317 --> 18:37.661
How can I end this torture?!

18:37.818 --> 18:39.950
You could do
something nice for Lisa.

18:42.127 --> 18:43.192
You're my mother.

18:43.197 --> 18:44.443
How can you say that?

19:05.776 --> 19:07.671
superstars on the way, folks!

19:07.678 --> 19:09.571
Hey, hey! We got more jazz

19:09.636 --> 19:11.250

19:11.388 --> 19:12.550

19:22.625 --> 19:23.600

19:32.245 --> 19:34.061
and  many, many, more

19:34.086 --> 19:35.030
funny names!

19:36.446 --> 19:39.581
And it's all to fix
this very talented arm.

19:39.715 --> 19:40.351
Ow!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.190
Oh, right,
the nerve damage.

19:42.397 --> 19:43.532
Here's
the benefit money,

19:43.788 --> 19:44.820
Now I'm gonna go vomit

19:44.868 --> 19:46.032
to keep my weight down.

19:46.665 --> 19:47.153
That's right.

19:47.205 --> 19:48.591
That's how Krusty does it.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.410
I wanna thank everyone
for this special night.

19:56.546 --> 19:58.742
Jazz folk may have
the smallest apartments,

19:58.888 --> 20:01.030
but they also have
the biggest hearts.

20:03.515 --> 20:04.921
But the biggest heart I know

20:05.048 --> 20:06.963
is in my sister Lisa.

20:09.678 --> 20:10.861
What about me...

20:11.225 --> 20:12.790
...Tootsie Childs?

20:13.196 --> 20:14.740
Lis, you pou
