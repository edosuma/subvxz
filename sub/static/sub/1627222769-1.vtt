Bruce, you down here?

[bats squeaking]

19:20.458 --> 19:21.333
Bruce?

19:30.958 --> 19:31.875
Bruce?

19:35.958 --> 19:37.083
[computer beeping]

19:43.541 --> 19:44.500
The blood.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.416
It's hard to get out.

19:49.708 --> 19:50.666
I'm sorry.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.291
The Joker's back at Arkham?

19:55.958 --> 19:57.875
Yes.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.166
I'm glad the cops
got to him first.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.166
Me, too.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.958
Can I help with
any of the arrangements?

20:12.041 --> 20:14.416
No. It's all been
taken care of.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.333
So, when's the funeral?

20:19.416 --> 20:20.416
It's already happened.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.625
What do you mean,
"It's already happened"?

20:24.708 --> 20:27.541
The mortuary delivered
the coffin last night.

20:27.625 --> 20:31.375
I had him buried
in the family plot,
next to Alfred.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.958
Look, I understand.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.375
This is difficult
for all of us,
especially you.

20:48.833 --> 20:49.833
Couldn't you have
at least waited--

20:49.916 --> 20:50.875
He had no family.

20:50.958 --> 20:51.916
He had us.

20:56.541 --> 20:58.083
What are you doing?

20:58.166 --> 21:01.916
There's a new player in Gotham.
He's killed seven already.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.958
Bruce, come on.

21:04.041 --> 21:06.958
Can't we just talk about this
for a minute before you
jump back in to work?

21:12.250 --> 21:14.416
What was Jason doing
studying chemistry?

21:15.500 --> 21:16.708
I don't know.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.583
He barely read
the back of a cereal box.

21:18.666 --> 21:20.375
Doesn't matter, Dick.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.041
Jason's dead.

21:22.125 --> 21:26.333
There's nothing we can say now
that will bring him back.

21:26.416 --> 21:30.166
You know, when Donna died,
you told me not to bury
my emotions.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.750
Not to experience grief alone.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.166
It was good advice.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.083
That advice
was meant for you, not me.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.500
People are different.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.916
-Bruce, you can't just--
-Life goes on.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.458
We both know that.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.375
Come on,
I'll make us some lunch.

21:52.375 --> 21:53.291
Lunch?

22:03.708 --> 22:07.250
So the Joker just killed him?

22:08.541 --> 22:09.583
Mmm-hmm.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.541
Sounds like Jason
went after him

22:12.625 --> 22:14.916
the same way
he went after Deathstroke.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.083
Alone and unprepared.

22:19.375 --> 22:20.916
I'm so angry.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.125
At the Joker?

22:22.208 --> 22:25.000
No, at Jason.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.083
Jason? Why?

22:27.166 --> 22:29.250
Because he never learned.

22:29.333 --> 22:33.416
When Jason left the Titans
to go to Gotham,
he was alone and angry,

22:33.500 --> 22:36.708
and I get that, but...

22:36.791 --> 22:39.791
Dick was hoping he figured
things out with Bruce,
but he never did.

22:39.875 --> 22:43.250
He clearly just kept
making the same mistakes
over and over,

22:43.333 --> 22:45.291
and it finally got him killed.

22:45.375 --> 22:46.666
Jason never evolved.

22:46.750 --> 22:50.333
He never grew past
his own worst instincts.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.208
Don't let that happen to you.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.666
Keep learning.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.250
Keep growing.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.333
[sighs]

23:01.416 --> 23:04.166
First, Donna, now Jason.
I'm sick of losing people.

23:10.750 --> 23:13.291
Oh, look out, crab.

23:13.375 --> 23:17.541
That's right. Octopus
gonna mess you up.

23:17.625 --> 23:18.958
Dang, cheetah.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.166
What'd that gazelle
ever do to you?

23:22.333 --> 23:24.208
What do you think, Rachel?

23:25.625 --> 23:27.458
The snake was really cool.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.291
Hmm...

23:29.375 --> 23:30.875
What should I do
for an encore?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.291
That's right.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.416
You're on an island
somewhere trying to
bring Donna back to life

23:37.500 --> 23:40.041
because that's a thing.

23:40.125 --> 23:44.000
Some bad stuff's happened
while you've been gone.

23:44.083 --> 23:46.500
So, it's time to up my game.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.166
[scoffs]

23:48.250 --> 23:50.458
Nothing tops a Super.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.875
That's total bullshit.

23:52.958 --> 23:54.958
Well, I know that.
And you know that.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.708
But... [sighs]

23:56.791 --> 24:01.833
You can be any animal you want,
just believe in yourself.

24:01.916 --> 24:05.583
Not sure if it really works
that way, but...
[chuckles softly]

24:06.833 --> 24:08.041
[screeching]

24:08.125 --> 24:09.666
[growls]

24:09.750 --> 24:11.708
[screeching]

24:13.166 --> 24:14.583
I just miss you.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.875
[indistinct chatter]

24:24.041 --> 24:26.500
[officer] We got two more
right down here
in front of the damn station.

24:26.583 --> 24:27.666
[dispatch]<i> Copy that.</i>

24:33.333 --> 24:36.166
Hey, excuse me.
Commissioner Gordon?

24:36.250 --> 24:37.375
Over there.

24:38.666 --> 24:39.625
Thank you.

24:45.083 --> 24:45.958
Barbara.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.875
Welcome back to Gotham, Dick.

24:56.750 --> 24:57.875
Commissioner.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.500
That one's
just like the others.

24:59.583 --> 25:02.458
Wrapped up in cellophane
like last night's leftovers.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.333
Thanks, Jones.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.458
Give me a minute.

25:15.416 --> 25:16.791
I'm sorry about Jason.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.708
Me, too. And the Joker?

25:19.791 --> 25:22.500
He was waiting for us
by the body.

25:22.583 --> 25:25.291
Took him back
into Arkham
without a fight.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.291
He did the same thing after me.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.583
That's what he does.

25:29.666 --> 25:31.666
He stole Bruce's chance
to get justice.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.791
That's the game
those two play, like always.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.833
And we're all the casualties.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.791
How are you doing
with all this?

25:43.416 --> 25:45.458
Honestly, not great.

25:46.041 --> 25:47.375
Tell me.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.666
Last time I spoke to Jason
was three months ago.

25:50.750 --> 25:54.083
-It's like once Bruce
took him back--
-He was his problem?

25:54.166 --> 25:56.833
Why would Jason have
gone out on his own?

25:56.916 --> 25:58.958
Especially after
Bruce told him not to.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.250
Jason Todd doing
something impulsive?

26:02.208 --> 26:04.125
That's a real head scratcher.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.208
I found a chemistry book
in his room.

26:07.416 --> 26:11.166
-So?
-Jason's not a reader.

26:11.250 --> 26:15.791
If you're looking for
a mystery to solve,
there isn't one.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.791
I loved Jason.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.208
He drove me fucking crazy.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.833
Wanted to kill him
half the time.

26:20.916 --> 26:22.791
But I loved him.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.666
He went out there
because he felt
he had something to prove,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.166
and he got killed.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.666
That's it.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.541
Mystery solved.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.458
[sighs]
Have you talked to Bruce?

26:32.541 --> 26:34.333
Briefly, at the morgue.

26:34.416 --> 26:36.000
And how did he seem to you?

26:36.083 --> 26:38.375
At the morgue,
Jason's body
was laid out on a slab.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.541
I would characterize him
as subdued.

26:40.625 --> 26:44.541
But did he seem off or weird?

26:44.625 --> 26:46.375
Yeah, he always seems weird.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.000
He's a weird guy.

26:48.083 --> 26:51.708
I don't think he's processing
this very well... or at all.

26:53.208 --> 26:55.041
Do you remember
Alfred's funeral?

26:56.875 --> 26:58.458
You and I were a mess.

26:58.541 --> 27:03.666
There he was the whole time.
He was quiet, reserved, stoic.

27:03.750 --> 27:04.791
He's in denial.

27:04.875 --> 27:06.375
Yeah, that's what
he does, Dick.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.791
It's the only way
he can keep being Batman.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.541
You know how many times
he's talked to me about
my father?

27:12.541 --> 27:14.750
Zero.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.958
So his behavior today
is the same that it always is

27:17.041 --> 27:19.375
when somebody close
to him dies.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.541
He just pretends
to forget them.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.791
No, it's different this time.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.333
I'm worried about him.

27:25.416 --> 27:26.625
Really worried.

27:29.708 --> 27:30.958
Would you talk to him?

27:32.500 --> 27:33.708
God damn it.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.458
Don't make me do that.

27:36.541 --> 27:39.375
We have kept it
strictly professional
since I hung up the cape,

27:39.458 --> 27:41.625
and my life is
so much better for it.

27:41.708 --> 27:43.416
That's why it would mean
a lot to him.

27:44.916 --> 27:46.166
Please?

27:51.541 --> 27:52.375
Okay.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.083
After work.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.500
And I have no idea
how long I'll be.

27:57.583 --> 27:58.583
Great.

27:59.708 --> 28:00.916
I'll see you later.

28:02.333 --> 28:03.250
Yeah.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.375
Oh, uh, thank you.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.083
Shit.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.750
[Barbara laughing]
So, then

28:13.833 --> 28:17.291
Jason corners the Mad Hatter
and he starts swearing at him,

28:17.375 --> 28:18.916
like, going off.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.083
"You short fucking
hat-wearing fuck.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.333
Fuck you."

28:23.416 --> 28:25.125
And Hatter stands there,

28:25.208 --> 28:28.041
stunned that Robin's
cussing him out.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.458
And then Bruce came in,

28:29.541 --> 28:31.958
and do you remember
what you said to Jason?

28:32.041 --> 28:33.000
What?

28:34.750 --> 28:36.208
Watch your language.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.333
[all laughing]

28:42.833 --> 28:45.000
I heard you found
another body today.

28:45.083 --> 28:48.625
That makes eight
in as many weeks.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.833
Any clues to
the identity of the killer?

28:52.166 --> 28:54.125
You never stop, do you?

28:54.208 --> 28:56.666
Can't we just have a drink?

28:56.750 --> 28:59.125
No new clues... yet.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.250
But I'll be sure to turn
the signal on if we need you.

29:02.333 --> 29:06.625
Your father and I
had better communication
when we were fighting this war.

29:08.041 --> 29:09.125
War?

29:09.208 --> 29:10.958
You still call it a war?

29:11.041 --> 29:14.500
It is a war.
For the soul of this city.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.625
I don't know, Bruce.

29:16.708 --> 29:20.833
Calling it a war feels like
trying to justify all the lives
that have been lost.

29:22.625 --> 29:27.041
Your father knew protecting
Gotham required real sacrifice.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.250
My father died from
a heart attack

29:29.333 --> 29:30.791
after being frozen
in a block of ice

29:30.875 --> 29:33.625
by a man wearing a fucking
refrigerator suit.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.875
-Mr. Freeze.
-I know who he is.

29:38.416 --> 29:42.625
That's how you see
my father, isn't it?
As a sacrifice?

29:42.708 --> 29:44.833
You dragged him into
this insanity,

29:44.916 --> 29:47.458
just like you did
Dick and Jason.

29:47.541 --> 29:48.708
It was a long time ago.

29:48.791 --> 29:51.083
You know what he did
to you, Dick.

29:51.166 --> 29:55.125
You almost lost yourself
because Bruce
weaponized your grief.

29:55.208 --> 29:58.875
And Jason... [scoffs]
You took another kid

29:58.958 --> 30:02.166
who was lost and angry
and alone,

30:02.250 --> 30:06.541
and convinced him
that he'd be invincible
if he put on a mask.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.458
No more Robins, Bruce.

30:10.083 --> 30:11.875
I chose to put the cowl on.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.416
To go out there as Batgirl.

30:13.500 --> 30:17.541
When the Joker shot me,
it wasn't your fault.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.250
But you drove Dick away.

30:19.333 --> 30:20.750
We worked it out.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.916
Whether you've
forgiven him or not,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.541
he drove you away
and he put Jason in the ground.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.083
You would think that
after everything

30:28.166 --> 30:30.208
that the Joker's done
to so many people,

30:30.291 --> 30:33.541
you would've found a way
to keep him locked up.

30:33.625 --> 30:38.250
But part of me,
a big part of me, believes
that you want him to escape

30:38.333 --> 30:42.583
so you can keep
hiding from yourself
behind that mask.

30:42.666 --> 30:45.166
You're as crazy as
the fucking Joker.

30:47.791 --> 30:48.666
[Dick sighs]

30:55.250 --> 30:56.875
[sighs deeply]

31:04.666 --> 31:05.625
Hey.

31:07.416 --> 31:08.541
What?

31:08.625 --> 31:10.291
What the hell was that?

31:10.375 --> 31:11.708
I asked for help.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.541
I am helping.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.041
Who?

31:17.125 --> 31:20.458
Whoever he would have brought
into this madhouse next.

31:20.541 --> 31:24.083
He recruited Jason one week
after you left, Dick.

31:24.166 --> 31:27.000
One week. And he replaced you
like he was replacing a pet.

31:27.083 --> 31:30.208
Come on. The last thing Bruce
is gonna do is drag another kid
into this mess.

31:30.291 --> 31:31.791
He won't admit
that he failed Jason.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.125
The Titans failed Jason
more than anyone, Barbara.

31:34.208 --> 31:35.958
[Barbara sighs]

31:36.041 --> 31:38.666
He had a lot of problems,
and we didn't have
the patience for him.

31:38.750 --> 31:41.458
We wanted the Titans
to work so badly,
we gave up on him.

31:41.541 --> 31:42.833
The Titans?

31:42.916 --> 31:44.958
Your West Coast
superhero school?

31:45.041 --> 31:46.458
It's not a school.

31:46.541 --> 31:47.750
We're a family.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.000
Go back
to San Francisco, Dick.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.500
I'm not leaving Gotham
until I figure out

31:58.583 --> 32:00.666
what Jason was doing
before he died.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.833
I just told you
what he was doing.

32:02.916 --> 32:07.083
He was being manipulated
and used by Bruce Wayne.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.875
Don't let him do it
to you again.

32:09.416 --> 32:10.541
Okay?

32:11.666 --> 32:12.625
Go home.

32:18.708 --> 32:19.916
Goodbye, Dick.

34:18.208 --> 34:19.666
What were you doing?

Who are you?

35:04.625 --> 35:06.333
Who the fuck are you?

35:06.416 --> 35:07.708
I sell in this building.

35:07.791 --> 35:09.833
I heard someone's cooking
something new here.

35:09.916 --> 35:11.416
Didn't want the competition.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.250
-But if it's you...
-[Dick chuckles]

35:14.333 --> 35:17.458
I'm not selling drugs,
and neither are you.

35:17.541 --> 35:18.875
You come here
peddling your shit again,

35:18.958 --> 35:20.083
I'll throw you
out the fucking window.

35:20.166 --> 35:22.166
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

[computer beeping]

36:10.000 --> 36:12.666
All right. Let's see what
you were messing with, Jason.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.750
[computer beeps]

36:18.833 --> 36:20.250

What?

36:55.958 --> 36:57.000
[door opens]

37:04.541 --> 37:05.583
Who are these kids?

37:09.333 --> 37:10.333
Who are they?

37:10.416 --> 37:12.041
Potential recruits.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.708
How can you even think
this is a good idea?

37:14.791 --> 37:16.833
You want to do to them
what you did to me?

37:18.125 --> 37:20.666
Turn them into
a sidearm, a weapon?

37:20.750 --> 37:24.041
Fuck them up in the head,
or even worse,
get them killed like Jason?

37:29.750 --> 37:30.833
Do you know what this is?

37:31.458 --> 37:32.333
No.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.041
It's an unidentified chemical.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.666
A drug Jason was manufacturing,
or trying to.

37:36.750 --> 37:37.958
What?

37:38.041 --> 37:39.208
He had a loft in Gotham.
Did you know that?

37:39.291 --> 37:40.958
-Probably not.
-No.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.333
A lab.

37:43.416 --> 37:45.208
So I'm guessing this is
what pushed him over the edge,

37:45.291 --> 37:47.833
what sent him out there
to get his fucking
skull bashed in.

37:47.916 --> 37:50.375
Oh, I, uh...
I didn't know.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.000
You didn't know
because you don't care.

37:53.083 --> 37:56.500
It doesn't matter to you.
You were already looking for
a fucking replacement.

38:00.125 --> 38:01.791
You want to be Robin again?

38:03.541 --> 38:04.666
[breath trembling]

38:09.333 --> 38:10.916
Do I want to be
fucking Robin again?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.458
No, I don't want to
fucking be Robin again!

38:16.291 --> 38:18.041
You know,
Barbara was right.

38:18.125 --> 38:20.166
You're just as bad
as the Joker.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.875
You and he have been poisoning
this city together.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.541
[breath trembling]
Dick, please.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.541
I can't do this alone.

38:30.625 --> 38:32.458
Then don't do it anymore,
Bruce.

I ended it.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.625
Ended what, Bruce?

40:09.708 --> 40:12.500
But you know what he was doing
as I caved in his skull?

40:13.250 --> 40:14.750
He was laughing.

40:14.833 --> 40:18.125
He laughed at me
because he won.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.583
You and Barbara were right.

40:20.666 --> 40:24.000
It's all a game
I should have stopped playing
a long time ago.

40:24.083 --> 40:25.833
It's over for me now.

40:25.916 --> 40:27.333
It's over.

40:28.625 --> 40:29.750
[breath trembling]

40:29.833 --> 40:32.250
You see things I don't.

40:32.333 --> 40:36.041
You saw that Jason
was in trouble, that he was
involved in something.

40:38.041 --> 40:40.166
Because you cared more
than I did.

40:41.708 --> 40:43.083
The city is yours now.

40:44.166 --> 40:45.708
You save it.

40:45.791 --> 40:46.791
Do what I couldn't.

40:47.708 --> 40:49.458
Be a better Batman.
