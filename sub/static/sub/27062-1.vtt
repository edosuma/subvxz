15:19.353 --> 15:20.180
Just like Freely.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.094
Everybody let your hair down.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.399
- I'll let my hair down

15:22.530 --> 15:24.488
when you give me a
straightening iron.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.925
[shrieks]

15:26.055 --> 15:28.014
- Oh, a bug, it's gonna bite me.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.146
Its ass lit up.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.061
- We don't have
those bugs in Haiti.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.416
- What's wrong?

15:40.461 --> 15:41.157
- Nothing.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.030
- Don't worry,
he'll bounce back.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.601
- [Freely] Boy, don't try me.

15:51.994 --> 15:52.952
- Okay, campers.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.911
Dawn comes early around here.

15:59.001 --> 15:59.741
Let's go.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.227
- [Puke] Wait a minute,
is that a snake?

16:07.357 --> 16:08.010
[Freely shrieks]

16:08.141 --> 16:09.011
- Snake!

16:09.142 --> 16:10.665
Don't leave me, don't leave me.

16:10.795 --> 16:11.753
- You're from the hood and
you're scared of snakes?

16:11.883 --> 16:12.623
- [Randall] Let's go, ladies.

16:12.754 --> 16:13.450
- [Roxy] Oh, that hurt.

16:13.581 --> 16:14.321
- Let's go.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.934
Not you two.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.458
You build a big fire,
you put a fire out.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.549
Don't even think about it.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.376
- Ow, dude.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.082
- [Derrick] Camino!

16:36.212 --> 16:37.387
All right, baby.

16:43.002 --> 16:43.698
All right, man, pull over.

16:43.828 --> 16:44.612
I gotta get something.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.266
- What?

16:46.396 --> 16:48.268
- This is good,
I'll be right back.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.184
- Hey, there's not gonna
be any alcohol or drugs

16:51.314 --> 16:52.620
at this party?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.317
- Really?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.493
What did you think?

16:56.624 --> 16:57.799
- You know, if I get
anywhere near that shit,

16:57.929 --> 16:58.930
coach will cut me.

16:59.061 --> 16:59.801
- Asshole.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.416
- Hey, get me an energy
drink while you're in there.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.376
And don't bring any
beer in the car.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.942
- Yes, I know, mother.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.074
No beer, got it.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.946
[deep tense music]

17:22.519 --> 17:25.695
[fast-paced tense music]

17:27.742 --> 17:29.787
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

17:31.224 --> 17:32.399
- What did you guys do?

17:32.529 --> 17:33.139
- I got your energy drink.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.009
Go, go.

17:35.532 --> 17:38.622
[police siren wailing]

17:53.376 --> 17:54.073
- What?

17:55.465 --> 17:58.294
Life sucks, why are you here?

17:58.425 --> 18:01.645
- I was going home, now I
have to drive your ass back.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.561
- Because maybe you're a driver.

18:04.692 --> 18:05.606
It's your job.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.610
- You're a smart-ass lowlife.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.875
- Man, you don't know
nothing about me.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.051
- That's right, walk away.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.184
- [Camino] You just
shut up, man, okay?

18:18.314 --> 18:21.100
- [Driver] Never
amount to anything if
you always walk away.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.406
What the hell?

18:23.537 --> 18:24.581
- Why don't I come up
there and kick your ass?

18:24.712 --> 18:25.974
- You know, stow it.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.324
There's some idiot in
the middle of the road.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.284
[suspenseful music]

18:36.811 --> 18:38.247
You broke down?

18:38.378 --> 18:41.076
[gunshot bangs]

18:41.207 --> 18:44.035
[suspenseful music]

19:10.932 --> 19:13.674
[phone vibrating]

19:18.809 --> 19:21.421
[gunshot rattles]

19:55.890 --> 19:58.588
[gunshot rattles]

20:16.563 --> 20:17.477
- Who wants 50 pushups?

20:19.914 --> 20:20.915
Turn those lights out?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.186
- No bars.

20:33.449 --> 20:34.276
- Shit, Will.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.193
- You got your
kiddies tucked in?

20:38.324 --> 20:39.194
- My kiddies?

20:39.325 --> 20:40.630
Yeah, I think so.

20:40.761 --> 20:41.762
[gunfire rattles]

20:41.892 --> 20:44.112
- Do you hear that?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.548
Automatic weapons fire.

20:45.679 --> 20:46.332
- Really?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.029
Call it in?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.162
- Well, the nuke
plant's back that way,

20:51.293 --> 20:52.686
gotta run your
exercises sometime.

20:53.991 --> 20:54.949
- He would have notified you?

20:56.690 --> 21:00.171
- Yeah, I got a
radio in my office.

21:04.828 --> 21:05.481
- Nuclear plant.

21:12.619 --> 21:13.315
- Phew!

21:14.621 --> 21:17.014
One of us stepped in deer shit.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.323
- Oh, yeah, we're
in deer country.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.023
I have never not talked
to my wife for three days.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.418
- You want to get away?

21:29.549 --> 21:31.638
You go to Alaska,
Utah, and here.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.684
I can radio her for you.

21:36.643 --> 21:37.644
- Yeah, sure you can.

21:39.515 --> 21:42.083
[stuff crashes]

21:43.476 --> 21:45.652
- Fricking kids are
messing with us?

21:45.782 --> 21:47.218
- They wouldn't dare.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.394
- Well, who the hell
else would screw

21:48.524 --> 21:49.525
with a police firing range?

21:49.656 --> 21:52.311
[gunshots rattle]

21:56.576 --> 21:59.230
[gunshots rattle]

22:02.625 --> 22:05.672
[deep suspenseful music]

22:09.850 --> 22:10.894
- [Lea] Freely.

22:12.505 --> 22:13.244
Freely.

22:16.944 --> 22:17.945
- [Shauna] Shauna.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.599
- Is Freely in there?

22:19.729 --> 22:20.426
- No.

22:21.688 --> 22:22.515
- Where is she?

22:22.645 --> 22:23.646
She said she'd go pee with me.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.214
- I think you can
go by yourself.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.522
- [Lea] Will you go with me?

22:29.652 --> 22:30.653
- [Shauna] No.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.743
Reveille's at five.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.223
- Can I borrow your flashlight?

22:37.051 --> 22:37.791
Forget it.

22:37.921 --> 22:38.661
I can see.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.189
Shauna.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.672
I think some farmer's
driving a tractor.

22:51.587 --> 22:54.503
Hey, hey, I don't
think he can see us.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.200
Tents, fall in, fall in!

22:56.331 --> 22:57.027
Everyone get out of the tents!

22:57.158 --> 22:58.377
Fall in, fall in!

23:00.988 --> 23:03.207
[screaming]

23:07.255 --> 23:07.995
- Shit!

23:18.309 --> 23:21.182
[suspenseful music]

23:30.191 --> 23:32.715
[gunshots bang]

23:38.939 --> 23:40.114
Holy shit, shit, shit!

23:40.244 --> 23:42.595
Give me the light, give me now.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.641
- God, dude, don't
go back there.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.600
There's some crazy farmer
ran over all the tents

23:47.730 --> 23:49.166
and Lea's dead,
they're all dead!

23:50.864 --> 23:52.082
Damen, stop!

23:52.213 --> 23:54.520
- Get your big ass
back here, dough boy.

23:54.650 --> 23:55.912
- Listen, listen,

23:56.043 --> 23:57.174
he's just trying to get
your attention, okay?

23:57.305 --> 24:00.003
Listen, you can hate
us all you want, man,

24:00.134 --> 24:03.398
but you have to
listen right now.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.922
Crazy shit is going
on over there.

24:17.325 --> 24:17.978
- [Cass] Come on, Freely.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.675
- [Roxy] Chicken.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.722
- Have you seen goosebumps
the size of golf balls?

24:22.852 --> 24:23.897
That's what my skin
will look like.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.681
Big black-ass golf balls.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.817
- It's not cold.

24:30.947 --> 24:31.644
Yes it is.

24:31.774 --> 24:32.471
No, it's not.

24:32.601 --> 24:33.950
It's all mental.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.213
- You're all mental.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.347
Come on, let's go back to camp.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.391
- Fine, go for it.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.656
- Uh, not by myself.

24:43.786 --> 24:47.311
There are snakes, and
bugs with their ass lit up

24:47.442 --> 24:49.313
and all types of shit, I'm not
going back to camp by myself.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.140
Are you crazy?

24:51.577 --> 24:52.665
We hear you back there.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.717
- Mack, have you been
watching the whole time?

25:01.848 --> 25:02.892
- What?

25:03.023 --> 25:04.285
No.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.114
Just got here, I
didn't see nothing.

25:07.244 --> 25:10.291
- Ooh, Mack is so naughty.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.032
- Freak, you need
to go back to camp.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.469
- Told you.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.210
- We thought you were dead.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.951
- [Roxy] Hey, turn around.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.082
- What'd you bring them for?

25:19.213 --> 25:20.519
- Hey, shut your trap.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.521
Some serious shit has gone down.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.740
- You shut your trap,
you cracker-ass white--

25:24.871 --> 25:26.612
- Listen to them,
listen to them.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.747
- Some crazy hick, he
ran over all the tents

25:31.878 --> 25:34.489
with his tractor
and he shot Lea.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.012
He shot Lea dead.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.537
- It's gross.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.494
- [Freely] You're lying.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.149
- We're not that gullible, okay?

25:44.586 --> 25:45.456
- Nice nips.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.722
- Guys, Puke, zero bullshit.

25:49.852 --> 25:50.940
Is it true?

25:52.072 --> 25:52.812
- Yes.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.380
- Oh, my God, Lea's dead?

25:57.947 --> 26:00.341
Shit, she has my makeup bag.

26:00.471 --> 26:01.560
- God, Roxy.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.565
- Where are you going?

26:06.695 --> 26:08.305
- We need to find,

26:08.436 --> 26:10.220
we need to find a car and we
need to find guns right now.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.571
- No, hey, if what you're
saying is true, we need cops.

26:12.701 --> 26:13.963
- We're in the
middle of nowhere.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.748
- No, wait, wait, wait.

26:15.878 --> 26:18.054
Why would farmers
try to kill us?

26:18.185 --> 26:19.578
- News flash.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.102
In this country, some
people are still racist.

26:23.973 --> 26:24.670
- Really, Freely?

26:24.800 --> 26:25.496
- [Freely] Uh-huh.

26:26.933 --> 26:28.021
- [Damen] Mack.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.858
- Well, nuclear facility.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.642
You'd think they'd
upgrade the system.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.736
Sectors one to three, all clear.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.260
- One to three, clear.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.698
Cutie in sector four
heading south west.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.090
- Coyote.

26:54.221 --> 26:55.091
- That's what I said.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.354
- Lovely accent.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.360
- I must go to the water closet.

27:03.491 --> 27:04.492
- If you must.

27:05.754 --> 27:06.407
Damn.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.277
- Gia.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.802
Hawking.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.020
We're going to yellow.

27:11.151 --> 27:11.891
- Why?

27:15.808 --> 27:16.722
- Deer season ends today,

27:16.852 --> 27:18.332
so foot traffic's gonna be down.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.728
- Tracking less people
does not necessarily mean

27:22.858 --> 27:24.381
less chance of an attack.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.820
- Just do your job, Hawking.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.137
- [Freely] Hey, hey!

27:41.268 --> 27:42.399
- God, stop it.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.620
- Puke, boy, I make
your eye black and blue.

27:45.751 --> 27:46.839
- [Cass] Where's your phone?

27:46.969 --> 27:48.579
- I lost it with your boyfriend.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.668
- I don't have a boyfriend.

27:49.798 --> 27:51.060
And I wish he hit you harder.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.761
- If we pool our money, I can
get us to a police station.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.980
- What's the police gonna do?

27:58.111 --> 28:00.504
- God, can you be
more trusting, Freely?

28:00.635 --> 28:02.985
- I don't trust the farmer
that killed our team

28:03.116 --> 28:05.466
and I sure as hell
don't trust him.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.424
- A farmer killed our team?

28:07.555 --> 28:08.904
Really?

28:09.035 --> 28:11.602
- Were you there, Cassandra?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.561
Puke face here said a
tractor ran them over

28:13.692 --> 28:15.563
and you idiots believed him.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.000
- Hey, get off the road, dummy.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.088
- Where are you guys going?

28:19.219 --> 28:20.437
The camp's this way.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.701
- Damn it, we need
to stick together.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.311
- Watch out for
the killer farmer.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.145
- I think we've walked
in a big circle.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.146
- Oh, my God.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.713
I have the worst migraine ever.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.105
- Shh.

28:36.236 --> 28:36.976
- I don't know why
I followed you.

28:37.106 --> 28:37.933
You're really not very nice.

28:38.064 --> 28:38.891
- [Puke] Stop it, Turd.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.109
- Dude, I can't see shit.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.371
- [Roxy] All right,
you know what?

28:41.502 --> 28:42.982
I really think we
should go back.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.418
- Uh-uh, we need some guns.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.377
- What if Lea's death
was an accident, huh?

28:47.508 --> 28:48.291
- An accident?

28:48.422 --> 28:49.118
Roxy, you are crazy.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.380
[imitates gunshot]

28:50.511 --> 28:51.425
- Oops, I accidentally
hunted you down

28:51.555 --> 28:52.818
and shot you in cold blood.

28:52.948 --> 28:53.688
- Shut up.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.691
I swear to God--
- Ignore them, ignore them.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.388
Ignore them.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.086
- Why don't you put me on
the ground and make me?

29:00.216 --> 29:02.741
- They're probably hunting
us right now, Roxy.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.525
- Roxy, they don't shut up.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.092
Just be the bigger person.

29:06.222 --> 29:07.615
We need to go back to the camp

29:07.746 --> 29:10.923
because that's the first
place Chombo's gonna look.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.620
- Chomo is guilty for what?

29:12.751 --> 29:15.884
- No, he just has two counts
of involuntary manslaughter.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.103
- Oh, you hear that?

29:17.233 --> 29:18.931
He killed two people
involuntarily.

29:20.106 --> 29:20.933
[imitates gunshot]

29:21.063 --> 29:22.108
- Oops, sorry, I didn't mean it.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.631
- Sorry about that, sir.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.371
- Did it again.
- Accident.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.894
- Damn.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.113
- Chombo's a bigger man
than you will ever be.

29:38.341 --> 29:39.255
- Slow down.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.996
You're walking too fast.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.782
- Look, maybe we should go back.

29:45.435 --> 29:46.480
- Let me guess.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.438
This don't concern you.

29:53.269 --> 29:56.533
[brooding ambient music]

30:07.066 --> 30:08.415
- [Cass] Hey, it's Cass.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.938
Leave me a message.

30:23.169 --> 30:26.433
[brooding ambient music]

30:48.759 --> 30:49.499
- Morning.

30:50.718 --> 30:51.371
- Morning.

30:52.981 --> 30:53.677
New driver?

30:55.462 --> 30:57.551
No, I don't need
to see your permit.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.814
Protocol says I do need
to search the car though.

31:03.383 --> 31:04.036
Looks okay to me.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.301
- Have a good one.

31:08.431 --> 31:09.128
- Thank you, sir.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.306
Nuclear plants have the
best fishing, don't they?

31:13.436 --> 31:16.091
- So many fish, it's sick.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.006
- We'll get sick if we eat them?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.007
- Enjoy, sirs.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.159
- Asshole.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.167
- What is that?

31:48.297 --> 31:49.690
- You want some more, baby?

31:51.953 --> 31:53.607
- Oh, like I'd be
interested, dick.

31:54.825 --> 31:55.914
- [Cass] I'm so hungry.

31:57.437 --> 31:58.568
- Yogurt in a tube?

31:58.699 --> 31:59.569
Give me some of that.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.789
- Sorry, Roxy sucked me dry.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.184
- You wish, loser.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.973
I did not just sleep on
this, ground's freaking wet.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.109
- Come on, Kim, I didn't
knew you like her.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.197
- Dude.

32:18.327 --> 32:21.896
- Your real name
is Kim? [laughs]

32:22.027 --> 32:24.377
Is your mommy coming, Kimmy?

32:24.507 --> 32:25.247
Your head down the
toilet again, Kimmy?

32:25.378 --> 32:26.292
- Shut up.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.555
- Kimmy, where are you going?

32:39.522 --> 32:42.656
- You're really
brave, you know that?

32:42.786 --> 32:44.353
- I don't feel brave.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.183
Everyone's gone.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.055
Lea, Camino.

32:52.971 --> 32:53.667
Chombo.

32:57.410 --> 32:58.628
- Well, I'm here.

33:19.127 --> 33:20.041
- [Camino] Cass!

33:20.172 --> 33:21.173
- Jesus.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.131
Where did you come from?

33:26.787 --> 33:28.702
- Some crazy dudes
come up the bus

33:28.832 --> 33:30.225
and they killed the driver.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.881
I barely got away, I've
been running all night.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.276
- Lea's dead.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.146
Randall.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.411
We went swimming and Puke
said that some farmer

33:42.542 --> 33:43.804
ran over the tents.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.937
- You were swimming with Puke?

33:47.068 --> 33:48.678
- We're headed to
the camps right now.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.117
- No, no, no, we
can't go back there.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.249
Puke's wrong.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.511
The killer shot at me.

33:55.642 --> 33:56.643
Not a farmer.

33:59.733 --> 34:02.127
- Well, I'm heading
to the camps.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.155
[screams]

34:30.284 --> 34:31.764
- Mack, it's a bug, it's on me.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.375
Help, there's bugs on me.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.029
Get them off!

34:35.159 --> 34:36.204
Get them off!

34:36.335 --> 34:37.422
- Chill, chill.

34:59.836 --> 35:02.883
[tense ambient music]

35:08.018 --> 35:09.498
[phone ringing]

35:09.629 --> 35:10.586
- Hello?

35:10.717 --> 35:12.762
- Hey, Mike, are you busy?

35:14.155 --> 35:15.896
- Just fishing with Chase.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.506
- A day off, wow!

35:19.682 --> 35:22.076
Say, I'm working for
the geological survey

35:22.207 --> 35:23.338
with the Rockford Study.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.559
Do you know Jim
Hickenlooper's farm?

35:27.777 --> 35:29.562
Does he have two white buildings

35:29.692 --> 35:33.000
or is his with grain
bins and a red barn?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.915
- He's got two white barns
just east of the house.

35:35.045 --> 35:36.134
- Oh, gotcha.

35:37.831 --> 35:40.573
Yeah, I think I see
someone down there.

35:40.703 --> 35:41.922
- Jim's a big guy.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.794
Not one you want to run
into in a dark alley.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.405
He's all right.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.363
He's got to be the biggest
redneck I ever met.

35:50.017 --> 35:50.713
- Redneck?

35:53.760 --> 35:54.500
Okay.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.416
- Yo, what we gonna do?

36:01.115 --> 36:04.031
Dude, stop eating
these people's food.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.125
Find a phone?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.173
My mama would kill me
if she knew I was up

36:15.303 --> 36:17.218
in these white folk's houses.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.524
I'm going to leave them a note.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.014
- Hey, hey.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.234
You placed your name on it.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.804
- Where I'm from,
you don't steal.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.677
- There's good
people in Haiti, too.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.462
But at least they know
not to place their name

36:43.592 --> 36:44.724
at a crime scene.

36:56.649 --> 36:57.693
- Yo, ya'll hear that?

37:08.704 --> 37:09.966
- Car patrol?

37:10.097 --> 37:11.316
- Correct.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.448
7 a.m. all sectors clear.

37:15.145 --> 37:16.799
You can't have food.

37:16.930 --> 37:17.670
- Sue me.

37:20.934 --> 37:23.110
- Sector eight,
guard patrol delta.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.286
Five members heading east.

37:25.417 --> 37:28.202
- Confirm but I see only four.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.812
All other sectors clear.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.033
- You are not my
burden to carry.

37:36.515 --> 37:39.344
If they ask me, I
will tell what I saw.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.129
- They're watching us right now.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.870
You think eating
a lousy sandwich

37:44.000 --> 37:45.654
is gonna bring in
Homeland Security?

37:49.745 --> 37:51.530
- I work my buttocks off.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.750
If I lose this clearance,
I lose this job.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.491
Then I lose my visa.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.276
- You read Russian books.

37:58.406 --> 37:59.973
What do you think
they think of that?

38:01.235 --> 38:02.192
- It's a fantasy.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.284
- Only English is permitted,
so don't lecture me.

38:09.722 --> 38:12.028
- [Gia] I lose this
job, I come for you.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.646
- You're a damn mood, woman.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.431
- She is so hot.

38:23.562 --> 38:24.389
- [Hawking] Whatever.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.478
- Dude, you know you want her.

38:26.608 --> 38:27.696
- [Hawking] Watch the
board, I'll be right back.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.742
- I don't have clearance
to be here alone.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.874
Hawking, I'm not
watching your station.

38:36.575 --> 38:39.534
[tense ambient music]

39:17.616 --> 39:18.704
- [Mike] That your dinner?

39:18.834 --> 39:19.531
- Uh-huh.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.970
What's an aquifer?

39:24.100 --> 39:24.797
- What's an?

39:26.755 --> 39:27.930
It's like a cave.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.845
Fresh water that
supplies our water.

39:29.976 --> 39:30.759
There's one below us.

39:30.890 --> 39:31.978
It's over a hundred miles wide.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.721
[pumps thudding]

39:39.899 --> 39:41.248
Pumps to cool the fuel rods.

39:44.077 --> 39:46.122
- I wouldn't want
to be swimming by.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.733
- Suck you in and squish you.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.605
[slurping]

39:50.736 --> 39:51.954
- Where's all the
water go after?

39:52.085 --> 39:53.086
- A transfer station.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.305
Ends up in a mountain somewhere.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.785
- In a cave?

39:56.916 --> 39:59.919
- Not the same one.
[phone ringing]

40:00.049 --> 40:01.573
Hello.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.183
- Okay, Mike.

40:03.313 --> 40:05.228
I'm over that firing
range you mentioned.

40:07.796 --> 40:08.493
- Roger.

40:10.059 --> 40:12.322
- It looks abandoned.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.802
- There should be
two dozen people.

40:13.933 --> 40:17.719
- Well, there's an awful
lot of foliage, and hold on.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.025
Oh, my gosh.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.418
Their stuff's
scattered everywhere.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.637
And wait.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.639
I see a group of five.

40:26.032 --> 40:29.470
And there's a blonde
haired female.

40:29.601 --> 40:30.819
- One of the boot camp kids?

40:32.212 --> 40:33.518
- I'm not sure.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.215
They're all walking
away from the range.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.828
They're wearing the
same color pants.

40:39.959 --> 40:42.309
- The kids wear uniforms, too.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.574
- Sure, but, why would they
leave their camps all trashed?

40:47.880 --> 40:48.576
- Hey, I gotta run.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.100
- Oh, okay, Mike.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.103
Sorry to be such a bother.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.283
- That sounded
like a helicopter.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.633
Maybe they're looking for us.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.810
Have you gone yet?

41:04.940 --> 41:05.941
Dude, it's not healthy
for you to hold it in.

41:06.072 --> 41:06.725
Just go.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.250
- You're not my fricking mom.

41:15.429 --> 41:18.650
[brooding ambient music]

41:25.178 --> 41:27.397
- I think we should split up.

41:31.053 --> 41:32.185
- Why would you say that?

41:33.229 --> 41:34.056
- Say what?

41:34.187 --> 41:35.710
- You just found us.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.584
- Yeah, well, I saw
them messing around.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.803
Think I should go check it out.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.066
- You just said we
should look for help.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.024
- This area's under attack.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.548
It would be helpful to know why.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.290
Puke can take care of you.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.857
- Puke?

41:51.987 --> 41:53.641
You're so complicated.

41:53.772 --> 41:54.599
- Oh, great.

41:56.818 --> 41:57.732
Hey, buddy boy.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.256
You driving a
tractor last night?

42:00.387 --> 42:01.867
- [Camino] Buddy your ass.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.565
- Yeah, you'd like to
buddy my ass, wouldn't you?

42:04.696 --> 42:06.306
- Are you jealous of him?

42:06.436 --> 42:08.221
- Jesus, it sucks out here.

42:08.351 --> 42:09.135
Camino, why are you here?

42:09.265 --> 42:10.484
F.Y.I. Cass, I went.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.271
- You know, I don't know
why I came back, okay?

42:17.578 --> 42:18.536
- Roxy, not now.

42:21.321 --> 42:22.322
- Here's one for later.

Get off of him!

- [Camino] Oh, Cass, I'm sorry.

42:39.948 --> 42:41.297
- [Cass] I'm fine!

- [Roxy] Fricking bugs!

[brooding ambient music]

42:59.228 --> 43:00.534
Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

43:01.970 --> 43:02.928
I'm just lost.

43:05.844 --> 43:08.586
[suspenseful music]

43:17.159 --> 43:19.074
- [Cass] What are you doing?

43:19.205 --> 43:20.293
Get off of me.

43:24.471 --> 43:25.646
- What happened?

43:44.317 --> 43:44.970
- [Puke] Give it to me.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.275
- [Cass] Hey.

43:46.406 --> 43:47.581
- [Puke] I'm an
expert marksman, okay?

43:47.712 --> 43:49.148
- [Cass] You're an
expert chicken shit.

43:49.278 --> 43:50.018
- [Puke] I saved your life.

43:50.149 --> 43:50.802
- [Cass] I out-rank you.

43:50.932 --> 43:52.499
Give me the gun.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.632
- Cadre of the Lady Snipers
don't mean shit out here, okay?

43:54.762 --> 43:55.981
You don't even know how
to load the damn thing.

43:56.111 --> 43:56.938
I'm an expert.

43:58.766 --> 44:00.333
- [Hunter] Put it down, boy.

44:00.463 --> 44:02.204
- [Puke] Oh, shit.

44:02.335 --> 44:04.206
- Yo, we don't want no problems.

44:04.337 --> 44:05.512
- [Driver] What the hell?

44:06.905 --> 44:08.602
- You guys are scaring
the fricking deer.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.604
- Yeah, well you
don't own the woods.

44:10.735 --> 44:12.388
- Turd, shut up.

44:12.519 --> 44:13.302
- Own the woods?

44:15.217 --> 44:15.957
Ha!

44:17.655 --> 44:18.525
You're right, Turd.

44:41.635 --> 44:44.464
[deep tense music]

44:46.335 --> 44:47.597
- Code four, Bubba.

44:47.728 --> 44:49.121
We're going hunting
for real terrorists.

44:49.251 --> 44:50.122
- Code four?

44:51.166 --> 44:51.906
No shit.

44:59.479 --> 45:01.350
- Those sons of bitches
ran over your friends?

45:04.266 --> 45:05.398
- And captured one of us.

45:06.791 --> 45:08.227
- So this is all
that's left of you?

45:17.236 --> 45:18.541
- Doris, you got your ears on?

45:20.892 --> 45:23.851
Aunt Doris, we got
terrorist activity

45:23.982 --> 45:27.246
somewhere near 6,000
north, 350 east, copy?

45:30.292 --> 45:31.163
- Just call her.

45:32.164 --> 45:33.295
- Dead zone.

45:33.426 --> 45:35.080
Not a cell tower for 50 miles.

45:39.171 --> 45:42.348
[deep suspenseful music]

45:51.661 --> 45:52.924
- Mack, follow her.

45:58.930 --> 46:01.628
[radio crackling]

46:07.242 --> 46:07.895
- Lunch break.

46:09.201 --> 46:10.680
- What are you monitoring?

46:10.811 --> 46:11.464
- Citizens band.

46:12.857 --> 46:13.553
It was nothing.

46:26.261 --> 46:27.262
- Lunch break.

46:28.481 --> 46:30.091
- Not tonight, Nelson.

46:30.222 --> 46:32.311
- Hey, I watched
your station for you.

46:32.441 --> 46:34.008
It's time for my favorite show.

46:34.139 --> 46:35.705
Yoga with the Stars.

46:39.666 --> 46:42.408
[deep tense music]

46:44.802 --> 46:46.107
- Colby, fight from the south.

46:48.675 --> 46:49.415
- Just me?

46:50.938 --> 46:52.635
- Hey, man, don't question.

46:52.766 --> 46:53.506
He was in Nam.

47:00.339 --> 47:00.992
- Hey, no eating.

47:05.431 --> 47:08.173
[light goofy music]

47:19.967 --> 47:22.100
- Now, that is the shit, man.

47:28.541 --> 47:32.675
Ooh, I am moving
to fricking Russia.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.852
- She's from the Republic
of Georgia, you idiot.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.076
- My aunt lives in Atlanta.

47:43.338 --> 47:44.644
Don't look nothing like that.

48:12.585 --> 48:15.893
[deep suspenseful music]

48:25.511 --> 48:28.079
- They comeback
to something here.

48:30.995 --> 48:32.692
- Wait, I can see Roxy.

48:32.822 --> 48:34.302
I can just look.

48:34.433 --> 48:36.043
- No, no, no, no.

48:36.174 --> 48:37.305
Look, are you sure?

48:37.436 --> 48:38.306
No, no.

48:38.437 --> 48:39.394
I have fought outlaws.

48:42.615 --> 48:45.618
[tense ambient music]

48:48.926 --> 48:50.492
- What do you want from us?

48:50.623 --> 48:52.407
Nobody even knows
you're out here, okay?

48:59.937 --> 49:02.722
[grunts]

49:02.852 --> 49:05.594
[deep tense music]

49:15.691 --> 49:17.302
You're the real deal.

49:27.442 --> 49:29.227
- What the hell is that?

49:34.580 --> 49:37.365
[deep tense music]

49:47.854 --> 49:49.203
- What'd they say?

49:49.334 --> 49:51.075
- Nothing, not a sound.

49:51.205 --> 49:53.033
I can't do another night.

49:53.164 --> 49:55.514
- Is that the power plant?

49:55.644 --> 50:00.388
- Can I see it?
- I think so.

50:03.565 --> 50:06.090
- What's it like
to kill someone?

50:09.136 --> 50:10.703
I bet he deserved it.

50:12.966 --> 50:14.011
- [Roxy] Cass!

50:17.492 --> 50:20.191
[deep tense music]

50:38.078 --> 50:40.776
[gunfire rattles]

50:45.172 --> 50:48.349
[deep suspenseful music]

51:06.976 --> 51:08.543
- [Nelson] So I have
to be very careful

51:08.674 --> 51:09.762
when I clean this panel?

51:11.285 --> 51:12.504
- Yeah, you bet your ass.

51:12.634 --> 51:14.941
No abrasive, and no
water, all right?

51:15.072 --> 51:17.204
- You guys, so full of shit.

51:25.734 --> 51:27.432
- Are we under attack?

51:30.957 --> 51:31.827
- [Camino] No one's home.

51:32.959 --> 51:33.829
What's wrong with your car?

51:33.960 --> 51:34.917
- I don't know, I just freaked.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.664
- Man, what are you doing?

51:42.795 --> 51:44.405
- Well, you said
no one was home.

51:44.536 --> 51:45.928
- Yeah, but what
if they come back?

51:46.059 --> 51:47.278
- All right, well,
we should be quiet.

51:50.629 --> 51:52.283
So these terrorists.

51:52.413 --> 51:54.937
These guys, you don't
know what they want?

51:55.068 --> 51:56.939
- Didn't have time to ask.

51:57.070 --> 51:57.810
- Covered faces?

51:59.594 --> 52:02.728
Maybe terrorists that don't
wanna take credit, huh?

52:11.650 --> 52:13.739
- [Camino] Hey, we could
cross the field on that.

52:13.869 --> 52:15.349
Can you hot wire it?

52:16.568 --> 52:17.308
- Can you drive it?

52:19.397 --> 52:22.095
[engine whirring]

52:36.022 --> 52:37.284
- [Camino] Hey,
you got anything?

52:37.415 --> 52:39.286
- Uh, try now.

52:39.417 --> 52:40.983
- [Camino] All right.

52:44.073 --> 52:46.685
[engine revving]

[crashing]

53:17.237 --> 53:19.935
[explosion bangs]

53:27.160 --> 53:29.684
- Need to work on your quiet.

53:29.815 --> 53:31.817
[tense music]

53:31.947 --> 53:32.905
- Somebody get me
a pot of coffee,

53:33.035 --> 53:34.211
it's gonna be a long night.

53:37.866 --> 53:39.868
Where did that E.M.P. deploy?

53:39.999 --> 53:41.783
I need a location, people.

53:41.914 --> 53:43.220
- Working on it, working on it.

53:46.484 --> 53:48.355
- Gia, call it in.

53:51.663 --> 53:53.360
- Full alert, code red.

53:53.491 --> 53:56.363
Backup power is 80%.

53:56.494 --> 53:57.799
- [Hawking] So the E.M.
fried most of the system.

53:57.930 --> 53:58.670
God.

54:04.023 --> 54:06.939
[helicopter whirring]

54:19.168 --> 54:21.258
- Air National Guard reporting.

54:21.388 --> 54:22.650
Explosion, sector 15.

54:23.782 --> 54:25.871
They blew up the whole farm.

54:26.001 --> 54:27.220
I'm gonna call state police.

55:00.340 --> 55:01.080
- Chombo.

55:10.045 --> 55:11.395
Yeah, I'm okay.

55:11.525 --> 55:14.006
- [Puke] Are you okay, princess?

55:16.617 --> 55:17.879
- I want to thank you.

55:18.010 --> 55:20.186
I wouldn't have found
Cass without you, son.

55:20.317 --> 55:21.666
But if I were him,
you'd be dead.

55:24.146 --> 55:26.279
- Chombo, he's not worth it.

55:41.381 --> 55:42.730
[alarm blaring]

55:42.861 --> 55:45.342
- Come on.

55:45.472 --> 55:48.301
Drop that, the plant
is under attack.

55:53.175 --> 55:56.048
[suspenseful music]

56:08.800 --> 56:10.802
[laughs]

56:19.637 --> 56:20.333
[gunfire rattles]

56:20.464 --> 56:21.508
- What is that?

56:26.513 --> 56:28.907
[gunshot bangs]

56:29.037 --> 56:31.779
[deep tense music]

56:35.566 --> 56:39.439

[gunshot bangs]

56:44.879 --> 56:46.838
[grunts]

56:53.497 --> 56:55.020
- Mack, Mack!

56:55.150 --> 56:56.413
Come on, come on!

56:57.370 --> 56:59.720
[Mack gasps]

57:04.116 --> 57:06.423
Come on, come on, come on.

57:06.553 --> 57:08.468
[hushes]

57:09.774 --> 57:11.645
- Camino, I owe you this.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.999
- Wait, you don't
owe me nothing, okay?

57:35.147 --> 57:36.017
- I'm sorry.

57:37.715 --> 57:38.455
If anybody.

57:44.461 --> 57:45.984
- [Cass] Mack, Mack!

57:50.597 --> 57:52.643
[sobbing]

57:59.345 --> 58:00.868
- [Chief] I.D. these for me.

58:00.999 --> 58:02.261
- Green is for friendlies.

58:02.391 --> 58:03.480
Red is unknown.

58:05.090 --> 58:09.660
- The unknowns are
probably an anom, amun--

58:09.790 --> 58:11.836
- Anomalies.

58:11.966 --> 58:14.578
The signals have been
increased since the E.M.P.

58:14.708 --> 58:16.014
- Do we look stupid, Hawking?

58:19.278 --> 58:20.714
Who the hell are the red?

58:22.847 --> 58:25.589
- I'm an American doing my job.

58:25.719 --> 58:27.199
- Tell the patrol.

58:27.329 --> 58:29.375
I don't want them shooting
Bambi and his mother,

58:29.506 --> 58:31.072
let alone a hunter.

58:31.203 --> 58:33.205
- Well, you can forget that.

58:33.335 --> 58:34.728
We should be careful.

58:34.859 --> 58:35.599
- Colonel Jackson.

58:37.296 --> 58:39.516
- I need all of your activities
transferred to my staff

58:39.646 --> 58:40.952
within the next 3 1/2 minutes.

58:42.606 --> 58:43.432
- Who are they?

58:43.563 --> 58:46.044
- Homeland Security, I think.

58:46.174 --> 58:47.524
- What activities?

58:47.654 --> 58:49.743
For the week, the month?

58:49.874 --> 58:52.267
- Why is he speaking
directly to me?

58:52.398 --> 58:54.182
I will be in your office.

58:54.313 --> 58:56.968
Custodians do not have
access during code red.

58:57.098 --> 58:57.838
Arrest him.

58:59.231 --> 59:00.232
- What's a code red?

59:11.678 --> 59:13.201
- You think you can
come to our country

59:13.332 --> 59:15.073
and kill without payback?

59:15.203 --> 59:16.378
- [Puke] You did.

59:16.509 --> 59:17.423
- You saw them coming,
didn't you, huh?

59:17.554 --> 59:18.424
- No, I didn't.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.600
I was just as surprised as you.

59:20.731 --> 59:21.383
- Did you kill Mack?

59:21.514 --> 59:22.297
- No.

59:28.216 --> 59:29.522
- Why are you here?

59:29.653 --> 59:32.351
- [Cass] Roxy said
they don't talk.

59:33.831 --> 59:34.919
- The last one.

59:35.049 --> 59:36.573
- [Puke] Kill him, kill him!

59:36.703 --> 59:39.663
- Cass said you're
not a murderer, man.

59:45.364 --> 59:46.583
- What the hell?

59:48.106 --> 59:49.150
She's like hot.

59:51.979 --> 59:53.590
- So?

59:53.720 --> 59:56.157
Bitch has one thing on her
mind and that's murdering us.

59:57.376 --> 59:58.899
- Chombo.

59:59.030 --> 59:59.857
- [Chombo] Cassandra.

59:59.987 --> 01:00:00.640
- Hey, just chill for a sec.

01:00:04.252 --> 01:00:06.472
- You ain't going though, bitch.

01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:09.170
- Thanks for doing that.

01:00:09.301 --> 01:00:11.216
- Look, I'm not
dragging her ass.

01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:16.743
- One of us can stay.

01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:17.614
- I will.

01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:18.702
- No, I will.

01:00:21.487 --> 01:00:24.142
[grunts]

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:26.797
[siren wailing]

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:35.544
- Three video feeds
are unaccounted for.

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:36.371
- [Walters] What?

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:39.723
- Cameras have diverted
our Homeland feed.

01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:42.551
- [Chief] Been busy, Hawking?

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:44.292
- Me?

01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:46.817
You disrespect me every day.

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:49.036
Now with these clowns, I'm
not just gonna sit here

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:50.429
and let you guys--

01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:51.735
- Yes you are, yes
you are, yes you are.

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:53.345
- All right, that's
the regular patrol.

01:00:53.475 --> 01:00:55.956
Our feed ended here.

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.698
- Those friendlies?

01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:59.743
- Well, I don't care, I
don't care, I don't care.

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.396
I need a two-mile buffer zone.

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:03.137
Get me incident management.

01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:05.139
- Look, this is the last
day of hunting season.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.402
Nobody pays attention
to posted signs.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:13.844
- Well, it is possible
that no one intentionally

01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:15.323
diverted these videos.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.761
Here's the last one here.

01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:38.085
I can take them an analyze
them in greater detail.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.700
- Why don't you analyze
them in greater detail now?

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.283
[gunshot bangs]

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:09.856
- Roxy!

01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:17.168
- Life or death reflex.

01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:20.562
[sobbing]

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.485
[rumbling]

01:02:33.662 --> 01:02:34.881
- We have three
layers of buffer.

01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:36.578
There's little chance
that we'll be breached.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.713
[whirring]

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:41.627
- This is pissing me off.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:42.628
Check the generator.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.066
Run down there.

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:50.070
- Control to unified command.

01:02:50.201 --> 01:02:53.421
We are standing by for a
possible third E.M.P. strike

01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:54.858
within our buffer zone.

01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:05.477
- So, you just gonna
drive up there?

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:07.653
- Wait, why don't we just
get closer so we can see?

01:03:09.133 --> 01:03:10.656
- How we all going
to fit in there?

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.789
I'll just wait there.

01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:14.486
- I hate this, but I
agree with the big man.

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:15.487
I'm sticking around, too.

01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:16.836
- Are you serious?

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.403
So we're all just
going to wait here?

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:22.189
- So I'm thinking, this
doesn't concern all of us.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.538
Why don't we just
stay here and wait

01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:24.844
for another car to drive by?

01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:29.675
- Chombo!

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.532
[grunts]

01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:09.410
- [Camino] Hello?

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:10.716
Hello?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.326
Hello?

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:13.806
- This is the
conservation police.

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:14.633
Who is this?

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:19.072
- [Camino] We're in
some serious danger.

01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:19.856
Okay, I think there might be,

01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:21.422
to the nearest water.

01:04:24.469 --> 01:04:25.339
- Water what?

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:26.645
You're breaking up.

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:27.646
- [Camino] Call the army.

01:04:27.776 --> 01:04:28.647
Forgotten any, yeah.

01:04:45.142 --> 01:04:46.230
- Backup power stable.

01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:50.538
We have a possible
threat in sector.

01:04:52.105 --> 01:04:54.629
- Eight, unauthorized
vehicle approaching.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.283
- Attack the gate
in broad daylight?

01:04:57.763 --> 01:05:00.287
[siren wailing]

01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:04.465
- Sir, this is a secure area!

01:05:04.596 --> 01:05:06.380
Step out of the vehicle!

01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:08.992
- What?

01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:10.080
- Sir, you must follow
my explicit instructions

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.124
or you will be fired upon.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:13.257
- I'm not the bad guy.

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:14.127
- [Army] Sir!

01:05:14.258 --> 01:05:15.172
- Hey, I'm an American!

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:17.000
[gunfire rattles]

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.392
- Sarge, I think I
shot him in the arm!

01:05:18.523 --> 01:05:21.047
Sir, lay down the
weapon face first!

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:27.967
[gunfire rattles]

01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:32.929
- Gunfire exchanged at
the northwest fence.

01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:34.974
- Vehicle disabled.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:36.802
- We need I-sap.

01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:10.923
- Gia, I'd like to speak to you.

01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:14.144
- [Hawkings] Have a nice flight.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.495
- Is there anything?

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:18.626
- No further activity.

01:06:20.106 --> 01:06:22.239
Oh, might be
something on this one.

01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:25.111
- Millions in detection gear

01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:27.157
and you guys can't find
a lump in your shorts.

01:06:33.163 --> 01:06:35.948
[deep tense music]

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:19.470
- [Camino] Guys, what happened?

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.994
- Your plan A, Chombo, dead.

01:07:23.648 --> 01:07:26.346
Plan B, Cass got in a
truck with the terrorists.

01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:29.610
- [Turd] Send your
girlfriend to the grave.

01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:30.481
Nice job.

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:32.483
- Very mature.

01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:37.531
What next, Camino?

01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:39.707
- We gotta get to water.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:41.057
- Uh-uh, no more water.

01:07:42.797 --> 01:07:44.625
- Commander Randall
said, before we got here,

01:07:44.756 --> 01:07:46.845
many people get their water
from some big underground lake.

01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:48.194
I saw toxic waste signs.

01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:49.369
They're planning on
poisoning the water.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.675
- That's stupid.

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:51.850
They're going to
blow up a nuke plant.

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.161
- According to the guard,

01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:00.076
who fired on him is
a group of teens.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.644
They also were seen in
another location of ours.

01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.516
- The troublemakers
from Chicago.

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:07.300
- [Jackson] All right,
what's happening?

01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:08.606
- No further attacks, sir.

01:08:12.914 --> 01:08:14.394
- Where was that taken?

01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:15.917
- The transfer station
showed this image hours ago

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:19.138
and since the last E.M.P.
strike, can't reach anybody.

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:22.098
- Anything light?

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:24.883
- No, no alarms.

01:08:25.013 --> 01:08:25.666
- Run a diagnostic.

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:27.277
If it's the E.M.P.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:29.322
Nothing's working right.

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:31.149
- You people, you keep
spinning your little wheels.

01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:33.020
And you're wasting my time.

01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:34.979
Do I have to do
everything myself?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.372
Send a patrol to
the way station,

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:39.071
make sure nothing
has been breached.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.768
Gia, get the transport
chief out of bed.

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:42.466
I want him to count
every drum, every pallet,

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:44.468
make sure nothing is missing.

01:08:44.598 --> 01:08:45.773
- Nuclear waste is stored there?

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.122
- It's a transfer
station for water

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.255
that's come in contact
with the fuel rod.

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.908
- Even kids know a
single drop of plutonium

01:08:51.038 --> 01:08:53.041
could poison an entire lake.

01:08:55.392 --> 01:08:57.698
- What are civilians doing
here during a code red?

01:08:57.828 --> 01:09:00.005
- Mike Tolrey's
conservation police.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.442
He knows the area and he may
know the kid in the video.

01:09:02.573 --> 01:09:03.313
- Kid?

01:09:04.923 --> 01:09:07.665
A kid set off an E.M.P.?

01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:10.276
- I saw a group of kids and
the kidnap video was at a camp.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:12.365
- Camp?

01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:13.584
- Could it be a diversion?

01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:17.022
If they stole the waste,
they could poison the water.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:20.243
- The Erie aquifer's a
hundred square miles across.

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:22.810
- Please, go give
some fishermen a fine

01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:24.725
and get out of my
formerly secure office.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.337
- Come on.

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:33.386
- Now, the rest of
you, nobody else leaves

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:34.779
until I get some answers.

01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:39.523
- If I had a .50 cal
with hollow points?

01:09:39.653 --> 01:09:41.307
- Ain't no video game.

01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:55.887
- I gotta see if
Cass is in there.

01:09:56.017 --> 01:09:58.194
- [Damen] Camino, be careful.

01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:04.025
- Come on, let's go.

01:10:05.853 --> 01:10:07.768
- What if they come back?

01:10:14.514 --> 01:10:15.254
- What now?

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:18.344
- I have been put on suspension.

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:21.608
- [Hawking] Well,
that takes the shit.

01:10:23.044 --> 01:10:24.220
- What takes what shit?

01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:28.659
- They think you have
something to do with this.

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:30.356
- I-sat, live.

01:10:30.487 --> 01:10:32.445
Finally really, I can
finally use a satellite

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:33.359
the way it was intended.

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.187
Sweet Jesus.

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:37.668
- A satellite is feeding
back our location.

01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:41.280
As commanded, your highness.

01:10:45.066 --> 01:10:47.373
- Would you switch to the
water treatment plant, please?

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:51.638
There.

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:54.946
- There?

01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:55.903
There?

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:56.730
- There.

01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.210
- There.

01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:00.430
Oh, I have made
it so, number one.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.692
- [Chief] Shut up, Hawking.

01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:05.478
Shouldn't we check out the
water station Mike mentioned?

01:11:07.219 --> 01:11:07.959
- So.

01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:13.878
Pouring nuclear waste into
an underground aquifer.

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:18.883
That really is what
all of this is about.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:22.103
- [Walters] I don't think
you should ignore it.

01:11:22.234 --> 01:11:24.802
You'd be kissing the
middle U.S. states goodbye.

01:11:24.932 --> 01:11:26.978
- Oh, don't forget to
kiss the Mississippi

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:28.284
and the Gulf of Mexico.

01:11:31.809 --> 01:11:32.549
- You're relieved.

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.116
- Am I?

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:37.467
Now that is a relief.

01:11:38.946 --> 01:11:43.821
God, it took you idiots so long.

01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:47.390
So how does it feel that
the entire middle U.S.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.307
will be uninhabitable
for 10,000 years

01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:53.657
and you can't stop it?

01:11:55.223 --> 01:11:57.051
Welcome to your
apocalypse, gentlemen!

01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:57.835
- Arrest him.

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:00.359
- [Jackson] Call the Pentagon.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:04.668
[gunshots bang]

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:11.979
[gunshot bangs]

01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:15.853
- [Gia] You?

01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:17.115
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I killed.

01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:21.424
And I'm going to keep you around

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:24.122
for a little bit
now, baby cakes.

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:31.216
Give me some of that fine
piece of ass before I go.

01:12:33.305 --> 01:12:35.176
- What will become of me?

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:37.440
- Show me a great time, then.

01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:47.406
- Where should I put this?

01:12:48.668 --> 01:12:49.669
- Be creative.

01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:54.370
[grunts]

01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:03.030
- Control.

01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:04.728
We have been breached.

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:06.469
Everybody is down.

01:13:06.599 --> 01:13:09.559
I repeat, security
room is breached.

01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:13.127
[alarm blaring]

01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:27.359
- Watch the hair.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.057
[thuds]
[grunts]

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:32.886
[thrilling music]

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.734
[Cass grunting]

01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:57.171
- Camino!

01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:04.091
[gunshots bang]

01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:14.058
[thrilling music]

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:23.214
- Oh, shit!

01:15:23.344 --> 01:15:25.869
[gunshot bangs]

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:30.134
- Hey, over here!

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:32.789
[gunshot bangs]

01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.880
[gunfire rattles]

01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:48.369
[whimpering]

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:55.855
- Freely.

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:56.682
Freely.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:00.991
Freely, shh.

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:03.559
You're fine, you're fine.

01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:04.821
Come on, come on.

01:16:04.951 --> 01:16:07.475
Freely, come on.

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:12.437
Give me your hand.

01:16:27.713 --> 01:16:29.628
- [Camino] Hey!

01:16:29.759 --> 01:16:34.590
[grunting]
[punches thudding]

01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:38.681
[grunting]

01:16:44.556 --> 01:16:45.775
- [Cass] Camino!

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:53.521
[grunting]
[punches thudding]

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:17.937
