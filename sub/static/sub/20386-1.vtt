00:31.520 --> 00:32.290
Whoa-ooh!

00:37.320 --> 00:38.760
Get out! Get out!

00:39.760 --> 00:41.030
Gerry! Out!

00:41.080 --> 00:43.070
Morning, Roger.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.120
Gerry!

00:46.640 --> 00:47.790
Dirty beast!

00:50.880 --> 00:52.510
- Breakfast!
- Good.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.550
I'm starving.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.240
I'm repulsive.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.790
Can we get some mosquito nets?

00:59.840 --> 01:02.550
- Please?
- We can't afford mosquito nets.

01:02.600 --> 01:06.390
- Oh, please don't tell me that's breakfast.
- That's breakfast.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.430
For the last time, we are poor.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.670
My widow's pension is for
me, not for five of us.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.910
- Is that it?
- Oh, er, no. No.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.670
Harrods are sending over some
kedgeree and some crusty pies.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.320
There's crusty pies?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.350
- Mine!
- No!

01:27.400 --> 01:28.960
- Give it to me!
- I'm growing!

01:31.480 --> 01:33.070
Right!

01:33.120 --> 01:35.480
There's gonna be some changes around here.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.910
This is probably how Harrods started.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.750
With a lot of hope.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.390
And a donkey!

02:30.440 --> 02:34.150
It's the ancient ritual of going
to market to sell one's wares.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.390
Now this is going to change everything.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.470
Can we talk about Leslie's moustache?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.280
- When in Greece...
- Well, Roger and I have our doubts.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.310
- I'm sure you'd like it if it was on a
bloody walrus. - Exactly! - Stop it, boys.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.960
Sssh! Sssh.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.680
Gerry!

03:16.440 --> 03:18.760
Kalispera. Er...

03:32.000 --> 03:33.350
Kalispera.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.710
Psari?

03:34.760 --> 03:37.430
- Elies?
- ~)

03:37.480 --> 03:40.760
~

03:43.840 --> 03:45.510
You have no idea what I said.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.990
No, I don't.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.030
I'll stick to English, then.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.150
Would it be fair to say
it's not going well?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.430
- I'm learning my trade.
- Ah.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.790
I own an olive press, if you'd
like to turn those into oil.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.310
No, thank you.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.070
Well, they won't sell.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.710
You can't roll over on this island
without crushing an olive and...

04:04.760 --> 04:06.750
yours are a bit grim.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.830
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.510
I'm being rude.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.750
Hugh Jarvis.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.990
Louisa Durrell.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.990
- Are you on your own?
- I've released my two staff for the day.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.430
- Oh, do tell me about yourself.
- I'm actually rather busy.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.080
Oh.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.640
~

04:34.760 --> 04:36.750
Forgive my enthusiasm. I'm...

04:36.800 --> 04:39.350
over-excited at finding a fellow Briton.

04:39.400 --> 04:44.560
Well, thank you, but I'm still more
excited at being among foreigners,
rather than back in Bournemouth.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.080
If you tell me you're happily married,
I will walk away with my head held low.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.720
Unhappily married?

04:54.840 --> 04:56.640
- Widowed.
- Ah.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.200
I'll, er, have the fish, please.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.110
Bad.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.150
Stinking hot.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.000

- No. This is the last.

Tracks, Roger.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
I haven't seen this kind before.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.630
Wow!

06:53.040 --> 06:54.630
Kalispera.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.950
I've been wondering how you are.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
~

07:02.800 --> 07:04.790
How excellent to see you again.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.830
And how excellent to see you.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.590
Your English is better.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.840
Yes. I am finding... my feet.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.640
Look. Like Jesus.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.160
[Come on.]

07:50.240 --> 07:51.710
Who are you?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.790
Vasilia.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.550
But how did you get in?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.840
I am your landlady.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.510
Ah, no, no. We have Mr...

08:00.560 --> 08:02.150
My uncle retired.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.790
It is me now.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.640
You have not paid rent.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.270
No. No, and I apologise for that.
It's been terribly difficult.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.710
You English treat us like your slaves.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.590
No, we don't.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.510
Honestly, I've been at the market
today selling... trying to sell...

08:18.560 --> 08:20.760
~

08:23.200 --> 08:24.710
~

08:24.760 --> 08:27.430
- What are you doing?
- I return these when you pay.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.270
But we've loved this house.
We've looked after it. Please!

08:30.320 --> 08:32.789
- Please, stop!
- I will stop when you pay.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.230
Or leave Corfu. Leave is best.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.200
Do that.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.789
But what will we sit on?

- ~

08:55.880 --> 08:58.360
Shave off those stupid moustaches.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.320
You look about as Greek as Cheltenham.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.480
You'll never guess what I've found!

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
Otter excreta!

09:08.920 --> 09:11.390
Good. I think we were running out.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.070
Larry!

09:13.120 --> 09:17.270
- Where's the furniture?
- It was seized by our mad new landlady.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.990
- I'd have driven her away
with the shotgun. - Ohh...

09:20.040 --> 09:22.030
- Oh, stop him speaking.
- Nyi-nyi-nyi!

09:22.080 --> 09:24.910
Horrid though she is, we owe her.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.950
We urgently need money.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.080
Come on, everyone. Ideas?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.960
We form a family music
band and go on tour.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.430
Having learned to play instruments.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.550
I wouldn't normally say this, but you
two girls need to marry well. Quickly.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.870
I may once have agreed with you,
but now I find that offensive.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.710
- Well done, Margo.
- Unless he's really gorgeous.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.350
Let's kill Aunt Hermione
for the inheritance.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.670
I'll hold her down!

09:52.720 --> 09:54.350
Oh, my God, you're not joking.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.470
Right. Thank you, everyone,
for your superb ideas.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.790
Today, at the market, a provocative
Englishman made fun of our produce.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.630
And he was quite right.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.670
Let's do it properly.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.710
Let's sell our vegetables and grow more.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.950
Let's make goat's cheese and... and honey.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.160
And let's cook proper English food
that nobody here has ever heard of.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.360
Or we could all sit on the floor and wait to
be evicted and then go and live in a tent.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.110
This is the police! Open up!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.480
- That was quick.
- Mum?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.350
Spiros!

10:34.400 --> 10:36.120
We've missed you so much!

10:37.240 --> 10:39.230
Guys, the fluff, it has to go.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.270
Just a bit of fun.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.030
Mrs Durrell.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.790
More lovely than ever.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.160
I could say the same to you.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.280
Come on, everyone, work to do!

10:55.480 --> 10:57.070
Very good, Gerry.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
~

11:10.880 --> 11:12.470
What do you make?

11:12.520 --> 11:14.110
Roly-poly.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.750
Poly-roly?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.510
No, roly-poly.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.710
Poly-roly!

11:19.760 --> 11:22.920
Foolish name. Foolish food.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.150
The Apidae family is industrious.
Of course as busy as a bee!

11:49.200 --> 11:50.910
But also noble.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.760
If you say so, Theo.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.350
Oh, God!

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
Urggh! Oh, God!

12:33.760 --> 12:35.360
Urggh! Urggh!

12:41.040 --> 12:42.800
- Tea, anyone?
- Oh, yes, please.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.680
Yes, please.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.200
Urggh!

13:06.340 --> 13:09.370
I'm switching to milking.
Bees are total bastards.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.100
- Leslie! - Who'd have
thought goats give milk?

13:13.140 --> 13:15.650
It was so sweet of Sven,
wasn't it, to give us the goats?

13:15.700 --> 13:19.770
It's odd to think you might have been married
now, if you hadn't been fond of each other...

13:19.820 --> 13:22.330
- But not in the right way.
- Yes, thank you.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.930
I've got to get back to my writing. My
novel is published in the next few weeks.

13:25.980 --> 13:28.970
- I should have finished the next one.
- Oh, don't write another one.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.900
I don't mind you writing. I
just can't stand all the...

13:32.740 --> 13:34.010
Aaargh!

13:34.060 --> 13:37.650
And if you must do it, write about something
that people will enjoy. Like a war.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.210
He will write what his art brings forth.

13:40.260 --> 13:43.890
But do write a best-seller, darling,
for God's sake. Any old rubbish will do.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.410
Hm, it is tempting.

13:45.460 --> 13:49.170
I've invested too much time in those
grape vines for us to be evicted.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.140
Oh, we won't be evicted.
Cos I have a secret weapon.

13:55.780 --> 13:58.530
More otter poo... but bigger?

13:58.580 --> 14:00.580
Scotch eggs!

14:09.060 --> 14:10.330
Hello.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.370
Hello, Sven!

14:12.420 --> 14:15.650
We wanted to thank you for the goats by...

14:15.700 --> 14:17.380
by giving you this.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.890
Spotted dick.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.930
Oh, thank you.

14:21.980 --> 14:23.730
How are things?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.650
You know, work goes on.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.690
Crops grow. Goats escape.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.690
And I forget more Swedish.

14:29.740 --> 14:32.410
Have a slab of toad-in-the-hole.
Always cheers me up.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.660
- Are you making these names up? - No.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.450
- Well...
- Right.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.490
How's the family?

14:39.540 --> 14:41.530
Er... Well...

14:41.580 --> 14:43.170
Gerry is looking for otters.

14:43.220 --> 14:47.410
Larry has got writer's block, so he's
decided to write in different places.

14:47.460 --> 14:50.460
Margo is on an errand and
she has a mystery boyfriend.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.010
Er, and I've spent our emergency savings

14:54.060 --> 14:57.700
on the ingredients for this
food, so it had better sell.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.290
Off we go.

15:01.340 --> 15:02.940
Come on.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.460
Come on. Come on.

15:09.460 --> 15:13.050
Another fact about otters, which I
got from Theo's book, is they make

15:13.100 --> 15:16.800
water slides and live in quite complex
communities, so they're a bit like...

15:19.020 --> 15:20.490
.. us.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.900
Sorry, Roger. I'm boring you.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.660
Roger!

16:39.460 --> 16:41.460
~

17:06.180 --> 17:07.770
Kalimera.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.810
Good morning.

17:09.859 --> 17:12.690
- Er, buongiorno. Miremengjes.
- Morning.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.849
What's mire-meng-jes boobly?

17:16.900 --> 17:19.490
That's Albanian. Albania
is just over there.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.849
Yeah, I know. I'm not an idiot.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.089
You must be a Durrell.

17:24.140 --> 17:27.089
- Yes, I am.
- I've asked around about your family.

17:27.140 --> 17:30.410
My mother said you'd press these
olives for us. For nothing.

17:30.460 --> 17:34.860
Please? As you've already got the
big grinding machine set up anyway.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.410
I was looking forward
to seeing your mother.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.250
Where... Where is she?

17:40.300 --> 17:44.090
At the market. We're selling a new range
of produce. Better hurry if you want some.

17:44.140 --> 17:45.540
Hm.

17:47.180 --> 17:48.940
Come and buy!

17:50.020 --> 17:51.820
These!

17:54.260 --> 17:56.060
From us.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.540
Why can't I think of anything interesting?

18:29.340 --> 18:30.740
Aaargh!

18:37.360 --> 18:37.910
Theo!

18:39.460 --> 18:41.650
I finally saw an otter!

18:41.700 --> 18:44.410
- How exciting. - Up by the
river. - I'll get my hat.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.970
Oh, thank you. Where's Roger?

18:46.020 --> 18:49.090
I dropped him at home, because
he frightened away the otter.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.940
- Oh, yes, that is OTTER-ly
unacceptable. - Must you?

19:10.340 --> 19:12.340
- Hello, Pavlos.
- Margo.

19:17.220 --> 19:19.220
The sun shines upon you.

19:20.300 --> 19:23.410
I love the way you speak. You
talk about beauty and love.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.450
What else is there?

19:25.500 --> 19:28.490
Well, my family talk
about money and violence

19:28.540 --> 19:30.540
and animal droppings.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.220
Would you... come to supper?

19:41.660 --> 19:43.650
- English food?
- ~

19:43.700 --> 19:46.500
It's actually improved
a lot in recent years.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.690
Oh, Spiros.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.420
It's... It's... It's just a disaster.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.370
What are we doing wrong?

19:58.420 --> 20:01.690
Well, you're foreign. People
think you don't need money.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.730
You're British expat.

20:03.780 --> 20:05.970
And you have no idea how to sell.

20:06.020 --> 20:07.300
Come on.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.260
- What... No. What are you doing?
- I just like doing that.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.100
Mm.

20:21.460 --> 20:22.620
Oh...

20:32.900 --> 20:35.090
- Oh!
- Yes. Now...

20:35.140 --> 20:37.650
- No, no. Spiros, no.
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.210
Nice.

20:39.260 --> 20:41.250
Now how to sell.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.290
You need more passion!

20:43.340 --> 20:45.610
For Greeks, it's like a game.

20:45.660 --> 20:49.050
But a serious one. Always look
like you're going into battle.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.090
Leslie, you do it.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.010
Buy!

20:53.060 --> 20:55.330
- Buy.
- Aah.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.970
Oh, madam!

20:57.020 --> 20:59.010
No, no, no, no, no! No.

20:59.060 --> 21:01.050
You're better with a man.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.700
- Oh.
- Yes.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.890
- What do I say? - It doesn't
matter. They speak bad English.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.540
If I may...

21:09.380 --> 21:11.380
For the gentlemen.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.010
Thank you.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.530
Excuse me.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.970
You don't know me. I'm Mrs Durrell.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.610
Erm...

21:20.660 --> 21:23.450
I've got some super
things for sale over here.

21:23.500 --> 21:27.010
There's a sort of an English
theme to the cooking and I...

21:27.060 --> 21:29.490
No. No, you're probably right.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.370
Be loud.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.930
Try flirting.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.180
Make people feel bad if they don't buy.

21:37.940 --> 21:39.530
Ooh, sorry.

21:43.860 --> 21:48.060
~)

21:51.300 --> 21:54.450

21:54.500 --> 21:57.540
Here, Mrs Durrell.
Location. Very important.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.730
Now... why should I buy...

22:00.780 --> 22:02.250
these?

22:02.300 --> 22:07.690
- Well, because they're the best and
because I do have four mouths to feed.
- Yes, she does. - I don't care!

22:07.740 --> 22:10.250
- Right. No need to shout.
- Yeah, steady on.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.050
No, no. No, I'm playing
the part of the customer.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.740
- Oh, I'm with you now.
- Oh, I see.

22:15.740 --> 22:17.290
- Kostis!
- Spiros!

22:29.420 --> 22:32.180
- Poli kala.
- Nectar.

22:34.620 --> 22:38.330

22:38.380 --> 22:39.780
Yeah?

22:42.740 --> 22:44.650

22:52.420 --> 22:54.410
- I can't believe it.
- Oh! Oh!

22:54.460 --> 22:55.610
Oh.

22:55.660 --> 22:57.250
Poli kala.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.140
~

23:01.140 --> 23:02.740
Enjoy.

23:04.580 --> 23:06.580
- Poli kala!
- Poli kala!

23:13.140 --> 23:16.540
- Is it me or is it getting OTTER?
- Oh, yes, no STOAT about it!

23:21.140 --> 23:22.740
Oh!

23:30.860 --> 23:32.860
I'm so sorry, Gerry.

23:42.460 --> 23:45.930
I left Mum at the market. Turns out
she could sell snow to Eskimos.

23:45.980 --> 23:47.530
- No.
- Yeah.

23:47.580 --> 23:51.980
She practically kidnapped one poor chap
until he agreed to buy a sausage roll!

23:53.060 --> 23:55.050
No, Leslie, no more shooting.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.890
It's so peaceful.

23:56.940 --> 23:58.690
This is how the peace is kept.

23:58.740 --> 24:02.370
Have you ever thought how awful you'd
feel if you actually shot someone?

24:02.420 --> 24:06.410
Well, I won't, because all firearms
come with a host of safety features.

24:06.460 --> 24:09.250
- Take this air rifle. - Les, I'm
not interested. - No. You asked.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.210
See this here, that's the safety
catch. It's always on until you...

24:14.260 --> 24:15.160
What have you done?

24:15.520 --> 24:16.970
That... That's not my fault.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.540
It's not supposed to happen.

24:19.700 --> 24:23.820
- OK. Is he gonna be all right? - I don't
know. I've never been at a dog-shooting before!

24:28.980 --> 24:32.730
Listen, Roger, listen, seriously,
Gerry mustn't find out about this.

24:32.780 --> 24:36.380
- He'll be back soon. What are you gonna do?
- Face the consequences like a man.

24:39.180 --> 24:41.180
Not that, actually.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.410
- I will take this.
- Hey!

25:05.460 --> 25:06.850
No, you won't.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.170
You have our furniture.

25:09.220 --> 25:11.220
I'll pay you when I'm ready.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.940
I give you one week.

25:17.300 --> 25:20.100
No money? No house.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.970
I've shot Roger.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.780
Oh.

25:42.860 --> 25:45.250
Erm, the thing is Roger is a dog.

25:45.300 --> 25:48.970
- Yes. - And my husband is a doctor
not a vet. - What's the difference?

25:49.020 --> 25:52.650
- I can't help thinking this is a dog.
- Don't you start.

25:52.700 --> 25:56.010
It's just a flesh wound. Gerry
mustn't find out about this.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.850
So I need to leave him
with you till he's better.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.740
He likes his tummy being rubbed
and Gerry generally reads to him.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.380
Why do they set traps?

26:14.100 --> 26:16.210
Because the otters eat the fish.

26:16.260 --> 26:19.850
- Oh. - As Nietzsche said,
"Man is the cruellest animal."

26:19.900 --> 26:22.170
Really? I'm thinking "woman".

26:22.220 --> 26:25.690
Ah, has our venomous
landlady struck again?

26:25.740 --> 26:27.010
Yes.

26:27.060 --> 26:30.650
And ruined what was, up to
then, a very encouraging day.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.290
She needs a talking to.

26:32.340 --> 26:36.130
- Your friend Hugh told me our oil is ready.
- He is very much NOT my friend.

26:36.180 --> 26:39.860
Well, he obviously wanted to see
you not me. He has a nice big house.

26:40.780 --> 26:42.580
No!

26:43.300 --> 26:46.770
- Why are you dressed so smartly?
- I've invited a monk to supper.

26:46.820 --> 26:48.450
- Why?
- He's so sweet.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.740
I think he'll make the perfect boyfriend.

26:54.660 --> 26:55.930
What?

26:55.980 --> 27:00.050
- Monks take a vow of celibacy, darling.
- You've got to be joking.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.850
- Not that that's a problem at your age.
- It is, actually.

27:02.900 --> 27:06.210
I've moved on from skipping and
writing in invisible ink, you know.

27:06.260 --> 27:08.530
- A monk is coming here?
- Yes.

27:08.580 --> 27:10.940
I hide the naked pictures.

27:11.820 --> 27:13.820
Has anyone seen Roger?

27:14.820 --> 27:17.100
Oh... I think Leslie took him for a walk.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.250
So, to confirm,

27:30.300 --> 27:32.410
the "toad" is sausage,

27:32.460 --> 27:34.450
the "hole" is the yellow?

27:34.500 --> 27:36.500
Yes.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.770
And the spotted dick,

27:43.820 --> 27:45.930
the "spots" are the fruity,

27:45.980 --> 27:48.370
the "dick" is the yellow?

27:48.420 --> 27:51.740
Well, yes. Yes, I suppose it is.

27:54.100 --> 27:58.370
Pavlos, is there anything you
don't like about being a monk?

27:58.420 --> 28:00.180
Yes.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.450
Getting up in the dark to sing.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.620
No. Not that.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.690
Anything else?

28:08.740 --> 28:10.330
Candle wax.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.210
It gets everywhere.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.820
She means not having a girlfriend.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.060
God is my girlfriend.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.010
I'm a writer.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.340
Have you got any funny stories?

28:29.140 --> 28:30.610
No.

28:30.660 --> 28:32.660
Oh, Leslie.

28:32.820 --> 28:34.490
Where's Roger?

28:34.540 --> 28:37.170
I told them you took him for a walk.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.780
Yes.

28:41.660 --> 28:44.050
And I bumped into
Florence and Dr Petridis.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.410
Oh.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.820
Who asked if they could borrow Roger.

28:48.780 --> 28:50.780
As they don't have children.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.700
- Hello.
- Hello.

Oh. That's "happy
birthday". Well, never mind.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.570
Bravo!

29:21.620 --> 29:23.610
I underestimated you.

29:23.660 --> 29:25.890
Your olives, they were
better than I thought.

29:25.940 --> 29:28.170
- Thank you so much for pressing them.
- My pleasure.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.930
- Come and pick the other bottles
up later. - Where? - My house.

29:30.980 --> 29:34.730
- I'll mix you a drink. - Oh, that's very
kind of you, but it's really not necessary.

29:34.780 --> 29:36.330
You have to say yes.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.250
Well, why?

29:38.300 --> 29:42.250
It'll be fun. You look like a woman
who has been starved of fun recently.

29:42.300 --> 29:45.220
- And you're going to bring
that back, are you? - Oh, yes.

29:53.660 --> 29:57.250

Guess what, Leslie. I've
decided to breed otters.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.930
What do you need for that?

30:22.980 --> 30:25.620

Hm.

Why do you hate Mrs Durrell?

You're mummy's little boy.

31:16.140 --> 31:18.810
No! I'm fiercely
independent. I've had sex...

31:18.860 --> 31:21.740
on... many... occasions.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.900
I really have.

31:26.820 --> 31:28.210
Good.

Hello. I've come to see Roger.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.010
Oh, erm...

31:50.060 --> 31:52.770
- In fact, Gerry, he's sleeping.
- Oh, that's fine.

31:52.820 --> 31:56.130
You should get a dog of your
own, as you can't have children.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.970
Yes. There are a number
of good baby substitutes.

31:59.020 --> 32:02.420
Listen, Gerry, there's
been a bit of an accident.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.090
What happened?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.850
It was just one of those things.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.490
He was...

32:09.540 --> 32:11.540
Well, he was shot.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.620
Leslie did it, didn't he?

32:15.340 --> 32:17.620
~

32:31.620 --> 32:33.330
- Oh, really?
- I was very firm.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.980
I appealed to her as one
firebrand to another.

32:39.180 --> 32:40.780
You shot Roger.

32:41.820 --> 32:43.820
What?

32:45.300 --> 32:48.010
- It was kind of his fault.
- What's the matter with you?

32:48.060 --> 32:49.890
He's a dumb animal.

32:49.940 --> 32:53.050
- He is not dumb!
- I was talking about Leslie!

32:53.100 --> 32:54.850
- Oh ha ha ha!
- Oh ha ha ha!

32:54.900 --> 32:57.900
- Think you're funny, do you?
- Yes! - Why is everyone shouting?

32:59.540 --> 33:01.530
Oh, you've found him.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.980
I think Roger should be
allowed to shoot Leslie.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.900
Right. That's it. I'm going out.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.610
When I get back...

33:10.660 --> 33:12.540
I want an apology.

33:15.980 --> 33:18.010
What a pleasant surprise. Margo!

33:18.060 --> 33:21.610
Oh, I have just acquired the brain of
a sperm whale. Do you want to see it?

33:21.660 --> 33:24.370
- I very much don't, Theo.
- Of course. You're not Gerry.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.610
He loves looking at animal body parts.

33:26.660 --> 33:28.660
What brings you here?

33:29.660 --> 33:31.650
You know everything, Theo.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.250
What's it like being a Greek nun?

33:34.300 --> 33:37.290
Gosh! I have a book of nuns somewhere.

33:37.340 --> 33:40.130
What has prompted this
spiritual bombshell?

33:40.180 --> 33:43.450
Well, this monk I know
is so peaceful and calm.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.770
- I'd like to be that way.
- What is his name?

33:45.820 --> 33:47.410
- Pavlos.
- I know him.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.980
Charming.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.210
Uh-huh.

33:52.260 --> 33:57.090
To answer your question, I know that
some orders enforce a rule of silence

33:57.140 --> 33:59.690
and others pray for eight hours a day.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.570
Oh, forget it, then.

34:01.620 --> 34:04.540
On the other hand, these
sisters look happy.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.500
And these are playing football.

34:12.420 --> 34:15.810
This place was my
great-grandparents'. It was a wreck.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.659
I've transformed it.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.650
But enough about me.

34:20.699 --> 34:22.699
However fascinating.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.730
It must be tough being the only parent.

34:26.780 --> 34:30.580
Yes. Though my son Larry
says they brought me up.

34:32.580 --> 34:34.570
- Did you ever marry?
- No.

34:34.620 --> 34:38.300
No, I doubt you ever met anybody
you love as much as yourself.

34:39.460 --> 34:42.449
Cancel the canapes, George!
Mrs Durrell is leaving.

34:44.340 --> 34:46.650
- Was that mean?
- No. I deserve it.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.300
Champagne?

34:52.500 --> 34:54.699
Oh. Thank you.

Why do you ask?

Why do you not answer?

35:39.260 --> 35:41.250
Yes, I... I know her.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.370
She's acting as our landlady
and she clearly hates me.

35:44.420 --> 35:46.610
I just wondered if you had any idea why.

35:46.660 --> 35:48.050
We...

35:48.100 --> 35:50.090

36:00.860 --> 36:03.450

36:03.500 --> 36:05.490
If you believe the rumours,

36:05.540 --> 36:10.460
she shoots, stabs or poisons
first, asks questions later.

36:15.780 --> 36:17.570
Well...

36:17.620 --> 36:20.130
I should probably be getting home.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.980
Thank you.

36:42.580 --> 36:45.330
.. my mother shouldn't
be cooking British food...

36:46.380 --> 36:47.060
Louisa.

36:48.060 --> 36:49.850
I'm afraid there's a problem.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.460
Mrs Durrell, you have poisoned Corfu.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.310
I can't explain it.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.350
The ingredients were fresh.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.990
I eat my food

37:12.040 --> 37:13.840
and I feel really well.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.430
Mother is a very good cook!

37:17.480 --> 37:19.070
Honest.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.270
~

37:22.320 --> 37:26.630
~

37:29.400 --> 37:31.630
I will give you all your money back.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.790
Or you can have replacement
food. Now I've got some lovely...

37:46.280 --> 37:49.200
It was a bit further up. Just
up ahead round that bend.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.440
Oh. No!

38:23.520 --> 38:25.310
Poisonous.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.990
So the heat? That's why nobody else
is selling eggs wrapped in meat.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.230
Maybe sell something safer.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.270
- Like?
- Tins of food.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.990
Just when I thought I'd
solved our money problems.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.230
- They'll forget you poisoned them, eventually.
- We can't survive till eventually.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.230
Oh, and poor Sven, too. I
made him buy those Scotch eggs.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.470
He only came to the
market to buy a hammer.

38:58.880 --> 39:02.630
I know why Vasilia hates me and
wants to drive us off the island.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.590
- Tell me. I'll sort it out.
- No, Spiros, this is my battle.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.470
She likes Hugh.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.150
- And she considers me a rival.
- Are you?

39:11.200 --> 39:14.230
No. It's absurd. But she
thinks I'm in the way.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.160
Is Vasilia really so dangerous?

39:16.960 --> 39:20.230
Listen, I hear rumours
all the time, but...

39:20.280 --> 39:24.000
the latest one is she once
poisoned a lover who jilted her.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.070
I knew it! It wasn't
my cooking and the heat.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.390
She waited until I was away
from the stall and then she --

39:31.440 --> 39:33.910
- The son of a bitch poisoner!
- I'd better go.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.840
More food poisoning and I
have dog hairs to remove.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.510
Yes, I'm serious. I've
put away childish things.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.350
- Well, not all of them.
- Good.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.000
- God loves children.
- Well, you'd hope so.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.830
In the beginning was the Word.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.670
- Beautiful.
- And the Word was with God.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.910
And the Word was God.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.510
Oh, it's already getting complicated.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.000
Theo!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.590
Theo!

40:48.800 --> 40:51.910
We need to be ready, in case
Vasilia comes and shoots us.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.150
- A tad melodramatic perhaps.
- No.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.390
She has already poisoned our produce
just to shift the blame onto us.

40:57.440 --> 41:01.070
- Leslie! Leslie, we need to have a gun ready!
- I'm still sulking!

41:01.120 --> 41:02.910
I'll do it myself, then!

41:10.840 --> 41:12.430
We've caught an otter!

41:12.480 --> 41:16.310
The breeding program starts here
where they are safe from predators.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.470
Otters are so rare. When was
the last time you saw one?

41:19.520 --> 41:21.990
Just now. There's one over there.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.040
Look!

41:30.440 --> 41:33.390
Margo? I'm guessing you've
been to see your monk friend.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.110
Yes, and I feel so peaceful.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.800
Right. Everybody, this
is a family gun practice!

41:41.560 --> 41:46.430
- Why are you grinning? - Because
I've been struggling to be creative
when it's all in front of me.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.350
- A hell-cat poisons and
threatens her love rival. - Ohh!

41:49.400 --> 41:51.390
A dog is shot by a gun-crazed misfit,

41:51.440 --> 41:53.230
while his sister falls for a monk

41:53.280 --> 41:56.070
and monstrous weasels
breed in the front garden.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.910
There he goes.

41:57.960 --> 42:01.150
Obviously, I should just
set my new novel here.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.190
Gerry!

42:03.240 --> 42:07.760
Chapter two. The misfit fashions a
dog-wheelchair out of driftwood.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.520
It's brilliant!

42:13.520 --> 42:15.510
- Hm?
- Thank you, Leslie.

42:15.560 --> 42:19.470
Upon reflection, if you shoot a dog
it's beholden on you to make amends.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.830
Leslie? Leslie, how does this one work?

42:21.880 --> 42:24.310
Oh, no. No, I'm never touching guns again.

42:24.360 --> 42:28.520
- Violence is not the answer, Mother.
- Right, I'll do it myself.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.640
Don't shoot anyone.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.470
A nice way to greet your landlady.

42:43.520 --> 42:48.790
Oh, I will defend, by whatever
means, my family and the house
that we have loved and worked hard at.

42:48.840 --> 42:51.000
Pay me or I come back with my men.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.760
Here. This is what we owe you.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.360
I look forward to the
return of our furniture.

43:04.840 --> 43:07.150
And whatever your reasons for hating me,

43:07.200 --> 43:08.910
we love it here

43:08.960 --> 43:12.150
and we will survive and we will thrive.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.200
We have a saying.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.920
~

43:20.040 --> 43:23.470
- What does that mean? - What?
- What? - What did she say?

43:23.520 --> 43:27.000
"Better to live with the devil
than with a woman who is angry."

43:28.280 --> 43:30.470
And how dare you poison our food!

43:31.020 --> 43:32.850
Why would I poison my own people?

43:33.400 --> 43:36.480
Only the stupid English make
eggs in meat in this heat!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.720
Ohh!

43:49.600 --> 43:52.320
- Who did you get that money from?
- Who do you think?

43:59.040 --> 44:01.710
~

44:13.320 --> 44:15.320
Good morning, bees.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.590
Spiros, you will get your money
back, even if I have to rob a bank.

44:21.640 --> 44:25.430
Don't do that. In any case, I
think, in Greece, they're empty!

44:25.480 --> 44:28.840
But, in the meantime, this
is for you and your family.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.990
As in the parable of the widow's mite...

44:34.040 --> 44:36.950
- Margo, darling, I'm quoting
the Bible. - Well done.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.600
.. I have little, but I am
delighted to give it to you.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.350
There's no meat in it.

44:44.900 --> 44:46.270
Thank you, Mrs Durrell.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.070
Can I say...

44:57.800 --> 44:59.640
Hello!

45:01.360 --> 45:03.360
Lovely morning.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.000
I'm Hugh.

45:08.720 --> 45:11.110
- For you.
- Ohh...

45:11.160 --> 45:13.160
Be careful, they have thorns.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.950
- Today is the day! - My son Lawrence
is having a reading of his novel.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.510
Why would anyone want to watch
a bloke read out a book?

45:36.560 --> 45:38.990
"Hello. What sort of
typewriter do you use?"

45:39.040 --> 45:41.910
They're finally going to mate. I've
no idea what put them in the mood.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.560
Men are always in the mood.

45:46.960 --> 45:50.150
Hugh wants you now, but it will not last.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.790
Durrell's kumquat liqueur!
Your pleasure awaits.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.480
Drinking heavily is such fun!

45:57.440 --> 46:01.350
- I shouldn't have my mother trying to
arrange my life! - Well, go on, then.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.870
Leave.
