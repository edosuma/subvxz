WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.366
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:02.503 --> 00:03.913
I'm gonna take the job at the CDC.

00:04.046 --> 00:07.038
JONES: Dr. Railly was murdered in 2015.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.711
I've seen the future without you.
I can't let that happen.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.335
Langley just sent a new briefing.
Does this have to do with Wexler?

00:13.472 --> 00:15.633
I have a hammer and! will set you free.

00:15.766 --> 00:19.179
Operation Troy.
I think it's what we're looking for.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.349
Operation Troy...

00:20.521 --> 00:23.854
It's how the virus starts in 2015,
somewhere in Chechnya.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.689
All this traveling through time,
it's killing me.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.685
- How many jumps have I got left?
- Not as many as I'd like.

00:48.340 --> 00:53.084
COLE: You still there? You hear me?
You have to promise me something.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.256
It won't make any sense.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.512
It's the Keys.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.801
I'm here. I'm still here.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.063
I'm glad I got to know you.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.199
MAN: Viral strain M510 was derived
from remains discovered

01:18.370 --> 01:22.204
during a private core sampling
expedition in the Himalayas, mid 1980s.

01:22.374 --> 01:26.458
Now, from the preserved tissue, we
extracted a previously unknown pathogen

01:26.587 --> 01:29.545
which we genetically modified
at Markridge into this weapon,

01:29.673 --> 01:32.756
which we will be deploying in Chechnya
for Operation Troy.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.465
If released in this room,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.428
this virus would kill every one of us
in two to three hours.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.463
Leland said it would be controllable.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.309
Yes, we manipulated its DNA
for covert targeted weaponization.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.639
We were able to engineer
a virulent strain

01:45.772 --> 01:50.232
where the time from infection to death
is extremely brief.

01:50.402 --> 01:53.769
The key to containment
is the geographic isolation.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.397
They won't have enough time
to reach a populated area.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.901
Once they're dead, the virus
will become inert in a few short hours.

02:01.038 --> 02:05.077
An airstrike there will cause
World War III. Is this virus our answer?

02:06.126 --> 02:13.464
Senator, we need to clean up
this mess ourselves, and fast.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.207
The next set of Wexler's leaks

02:15.344 --> 02:19.633
won'tjust bring down this agency
but everyone in this room.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.131
Now, unless you wanna run
your re-election

02:22.267 --> 02:26.636
from a prison cell next to mine,
we need this guy dead.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.979
Wexler leaks continued
to spark debate

02:29.107 --> 02:32.019
at the controversial nature
of the CIA program.

02:32.152 --> 02:36.441
Allegations of the widespread civil
rights violations were strongly disputed

02:36.573 --> 02:40.657
by Assistant Director Michael Pratt
in his recent senate testimony.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.823
For ex-CIA operative Adam Wexler...

02:43.955 --> 02:48.790
You're walking through a red forest
and the grass is tall.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.043
You've been there before.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.707
Cassie.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.592
Cassie, hey! What are you doing?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.929
Did you burn yourself?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.178
Just give me a second.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.597
Let me see.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.688
- It's not that bad.
- Yes, it is.

03:11.817 --> 03:15.025
Hey. You're here, safe.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.240
That's all that matters.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.816
You're not looking so good yourself.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.246
Don't worry about me.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.786
The 12 Monkeys move around.
They don't stay in one place for long.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.877
What about Aaron? Did he find anything
on that Operation Troy?

03:34.005 --> 03:36.542
- No, not yet.
- What about the greenhouse?

03:36.675 --> 03:39.417
- You guys have something?
- The name on the lease is fake.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.128
Everything from the water bill to
the seed supplier was paid for in cash.

03:43.265 --> 03:47.099
But there is this.
That picture you found.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.557
Yeah, right there. Could be a monkey.

03:50.689 --> 03:54.307
The name at the bottom:
Edward Garret, PhD.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.893
He's a professor
of Middle Eastern antiquity.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.405
How do we find him?

04:04.536 --> 04:07.198
- Thank you so much.
- Have a lovely evening.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.666
Hi there.
Dr. Cassandra Railly and guest.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.039
- OK.
- Has Dr. Garret arrived yet?

04:19.217 --> 04:21.333
He has. He should be in the main hall.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.802
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.275
Sir, would you care
for a tandoori skewer?

04:46.953 --> 04:49.035
Thanks.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.871
All right, I think
he's probably in there somewhere.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.587
It's amazing.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.297
All of it.

05:01.426 --> 05:05.214
During the outbreak,
people raided the museums,

05:05.347 --> 05:07.838
took what they wanted,
destroyed the rest.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.766
Never seen anything like this.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.765
Oh, no, Cole.
You can't touch the art. You just look.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.233
Well, that's bullshit.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.732
OK, Garret's in the main hall.

05:22.906 --> 05:27.900
Hey, wait a minute. What's the rush?
He's not going anywhere.

05:28.078 --> 05:31.366
We should grab a drink or some food

05:31.498 --> 05:35.411
and just... be us for a while.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.417
I'm sorry, have we met?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.622
The mission is this way.

05:43.051 --> 05:49.718
# These arms of mine

05:49.850 --> 05:52.136
# They are lonely...

05:52.269 --> 05:54.351
I love this.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.395
The music.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.645
Come here.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.278
Cole.

06:02.445 --> 06:07.530
Just forget about that guy for a minute.
We're here. Let's... Let's be here.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.074
- You know how to dance?
- No.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.361
Show me.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.116
OK. Um...

06:18.253 --> 06:22.713
Take this hand here
and give me that hand

06:22.841 --> 06:25.253
and just rock back and forth.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.803
You can loosen up a little bit.
There you go.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.932
You're good.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.442
You smell nice.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.197
You smell like tandoori skewers.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.029
I had a bunch of 'em.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.198
Yes, I know.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.535
That's him.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.209
There he is. I'm gonna go talk to him.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.419
- Excuse me, Dr. Garret?
- Yes.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.591
EE

07:12.724 --> 07:14.965
May I speak with you privately
for a minute?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.217
- Of course. Excuse me.
- Certainly.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.221
l'm Dr. Cassandra Railly.

07:20.357 --> 07:26.102
l was wondering what you could tell me
about this symbol on this artifact.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.604
It's... lt's Druze, a religious piece.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.401
It's used as a ceremonial
to crush herbs in tea.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.245
- Druze?
- Yes.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.491
The religion originated
in southern Syria,

07:40.627 --> 07:44.916
but this particular piece belongs to
a smaller offshoot located in Chechnya.

07:45.048 --> 07:49.758
lt references a pact
between God and man,

07:49.928 --> 07:52.260
the pact of time's custodian.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.254
- Chechnya?
- Yes.

07:54.391 --> 07:58.100
This... this symbol,
what does that mean?

07:59.020 --> 08:03.354
You'd have to ask a Druze.
It's a highly secretive religion.

08:03.483 --> 08:07.146
You have to be born Druze.
They don't take converts.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.270
Have you ever heard
of the Army of the 12 Monkeys?

08:14.369 --> 08:18.078
You know what? You're a beautiful woman.
You should have stuck with that.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.195
We're through here.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.416
Mass extinction is a regular feature
of our planet's history.

08:23.545 --> 08:27.709
Tonight's guest of honor comes from
a world that we can only imagine.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.129
He saw the end of an era
and the world changed around him.

08:31.261 --> 08:36.096
Esteemed guest is very old, 72...

08:42.689 --> 08:45.351
He knows something. Your turn.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.906
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.
We need to talk.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.193
Come on.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.163
I can't believe
you let him get in the first punch.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.284
He just grazed me.
Let's not get carried away.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.373
Our tall man spooked Garret,

09:08.506 --> 09:12.249
came to him asking about his time
in Chechnya in the religious sect.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.923
I think I scared him pretty good.
He would've talked if he knew more.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.381
Hey.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.510
Wow! I'm underdressed.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.230
Is that my tux?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.772
We tracked the symbol.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.438
The 12 Monkeys
might have ties to Chechnya.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.736
Wait.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.572
Wexler.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.411
Wexler, the hacker? What about him?

09:42.540 --> 09:45.452
There's intel
that he's hiding out in Chechnya.

09:50.381 --> 09:54.090
Adam Wexler, former CIA analyst.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.505
He's been leaking classified secrets.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.722
Senator Royce insinuated Operation Troy
was connected to Wexler.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.304
They're gonna use the virus to kill him.

10:03.436 --> 10:07.179
The agency had some kind of deal
with Leland Goines.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.274
This could be the Markridge virus,
M510, the strain you were talking about.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.394
The CIA would use it
to kill one of their own?

10:14.531 --> 10:19.025
Must be way off book. It's why
I haven't been able to dig anything up.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.995
Jones was right. The 12 Monkeys know
the virus is gonna be in Chechnya.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.281
They're gonna send someone
to try to get it.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.033
You have to tell Royce or someone
what could happen.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.456
We are talking about
an illegal government op

10:31.589 --> 10:33.625
that I'm not even supposed
to know about.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.337
Cole?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.961
They're gonna send me back
a week from today.

10:40.098 --> 10:44.091
I need to know all the information
you can get on this Chechnya thing.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.091
Everything.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.520
What?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.731
You get used to it.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.976
I'm just worried about my tux.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.108
I have to go back to work.
Jules just called.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.950
Hey, how can you possibly work
with all this going on?

11:02.078 --> 11:05.115
Dangerous bioagents like M510
have a lot of protocols.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.456
If this were moved to a military
facility, there might be records.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.667
If Markridge and the CIA
followed the law.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.457
Well, I'm gonna dig up whatever I can.
You should too.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.002
- Cassie, if we get caught...
- What, prison?

11:16.759 --> 11:20.718
Aaron, if this operation happens,
we all die.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.518
Thank you, sir. See you tomorrow.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.742
Marker.
Thought you had someplace to be tonight.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.912
I forgot my phone in my office.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.876
- Sir, let me help you with that.
- Oh.

11:56.674 --> 12:02.010
Keep your phone on you.
I may need to reach you later on.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.091
Of course.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.503
(PHONE RINGS)

12:41.803 --> 12:43.259
- Dr. Railly.
- COLE: Cassie.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.800
I don't have time to explain,
but I'm in Chechnya.

12:45.974 --> 12:46.838
Cole?

12:47.058 --> 12:49.265
Listen, this isn't gonna make
a lot of sense.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.807
I need your help. I have the virus,
but someone's trying to kill me.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.430
- (GUNSHOT)
- But you were just here.

12:55.566 --> 12:59.104
Operation Troy is happening right now.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.468
Excuse me. Do you have any bleach?

13:33.604 --> 13:34.764
Bleach.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.329
All right, who's got the case?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.249
Right on time.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.563
Follow that white car.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.541
Whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down.
They can see us.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.801
Speed up. You're gonna lose 'em.
Look, we see them, they don't see us.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.800
- OK? Follow them.
- 007.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.723
Yeah, double 0... whatever.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.411

keep going, keep going.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.369
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Dr. Railly.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.709
Cassie, I don't have time to explain,
but I'm in Chechnya.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.667
Cole?

16:45.796 --> 16:48.082
Listen, this isn't gonna make
a lot of sense.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.832
I have the virus,
but someone's trying to kill me.

16:51.928 --> 16:56.297
- But you were just here.
- Operation Troy is happening right now.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.599
[have a chance to end it.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.928
- How can that be?
- The virus is in a metal briefcase.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.683
I'm here because in one week you
and Aaron are gonna give me the details

17:07.818 --> 17:10.309
so they can send me back to today
to stop it.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.062
- I don't understand.
- The monkeys are here.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.360
They're after me.
I beat 'em to the virus.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.235
Cole, whatever you do,
do not open that case.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.245
I know that.
I need to know how to destroy it.

- (GUNSHOT)
- Cole?

17:26.087 --> 17:27.042
Cole?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.736

17:59.870 --> 18:02.361
Maybe you left it in your briefcase.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.580
Ah.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.624
Excuse me.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.304
- Cassie, what's wrong?
- Cole just called from Chechnya.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.011
He has the virus,
but someone is trying to kill him.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.726
Operation Troy is happening right now.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.434
He said something about you and me
giving him the details a week from now.

18:29.567 --> 18:33.606
- It's impossible. I haven't...
- We have to tell the CIA now.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.969
(YELLS)

19:02.767 --> 19:04.507
(GUNSHOT)

19:12.151 --> 19:15.609
Listen to me, Mike. At my house
there's an envelope, top desk drawer.

19:15.738 --> 19:19.947
Go right now and get it. If you don't
hear from me in 24 hours, open it.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.067
- What was that?
- Insurance.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.326
(PHONE RINGS)

19:25.122 --> 19:29.786
Cole, are you OK? I'm with Aaron.
We're arriving at the CIA right now.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.207
- We're gonna tell them...
- No, no, no, no. No authorities.

19:33.339 --> 19:38.003
Cole, there is no other way.
Now, you have to explain this to me.

19:38.135 --> 19:42.469
Last time you saw me, at the bookstore,
the night at the museum,

19:42.598 --> 19:44.429
I told you I'd be sent back in a week.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.265
I was. This hasn't happened for you yet.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.351
- But it has for me.
- OK.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.309
In a week's time,
Aaron is gonna come into the bookstore

19:52.525 --> 19:55.312
and tell us that Operation Troy
has already happened.

19:55.486 --> 19:59.274
- But Aaron doesn't know anything...
- He doesn't know now.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.068
But one week into your future,

20:01.200 --> 20:05.034
he'll know how to intercept the virus
because it will already have happened.

20:05.162 --> 20:10.156
That's how the two of you help me
to get back to today to stop it.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.534
Now, I have the case.
I need to destroy the virus.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.707
Don't tell me bleach.
I couldn't get any.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.750
What?

20:16.882 --> 20:19.749
A week from today,
you're gonna tell me to use bleach.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.262
I'm in the middle of the woods.
No bleach.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.221
- OK. Um, can you start a fire?
- A fire?

20:25.349 --> 20:29.433
The heat from the fire
will destroy the virus from the outside.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.934
- Cole?
- No fire.

20:31.063 --> 20:31.893
Cole.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.146
Lost him.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.789
No, damn it, you're not listening.
I did call several times.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.082
I understand
that we don't have clearance.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.706
My name is Aaron Marker.
I work for Senator Royce.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.926
- I work with the CDC.
- Michael Pratt, operations command.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.888
- What the hell is this?
- We know about Operation Troy.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.349
It's been compromised.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.594
(MEN SPEAK CHECHEN)

21:18.819 --> 21:20.104
Wexler.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.320
You're not the man I hired
to bring me my money.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.152
How'd you know
about my special delivery?

21:26.327 --> 21:29.034
Don't open that briefcase!

21:29.163 --> 21:32.280
I can usually spot a G-man,
but you... no.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.744
Too soft to be a SEAL.

21:34.877 --> 21:38.415
There's a virus in that case.
The CIA sent it to kill you.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.001
Hold on.
You'll get your money.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.171
You open that case,
everything goes to hell.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.091
The great American fear.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.385
Open the case.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.099
- No!
- Open the case!

22:22.049 --> 22:24.040
It's been two hours
since he last called.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.167
We have to do something.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.215
Cass, agency's not gonna let us
out of their sight.

22:31.892 --> 22:35.350
Dr. Railly, I need a word in private
with my aide.

22:42.111 --> 22:45.649
You know, when I was a boy, I had a dog.

22:45.781 --> 22:50.491
Great big chocolate lab. Digby. Most
goddamn loyal pet you could imagine.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.573
Slept by my bed, barked at strangers.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.327
You know how Digby died?

22:57.459 --> 22:59.199
A Chrysler.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.794
Darted out into traffic
after a cute little Siamese cat

23:02.923 --> 23:04.504
that lived just across the way.

23:04.675 --> 23:11.012
Because no matter how loyal Digby was,
he just couldn't help himself.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.140
This isn't Cassie's fault.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.011
The man who abducted her two years ago
is in Chechnya.

23:18.147 --> 23:22.857
I know about Chechnya.
The question is, how do you?

23:22.985 --> 23:25.317
My key fob?

23:26.572 --> 23:31.157
Son, there's not a chance in hell that
you're on your feet when this is over.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.287
Based on what's in those files,

23:44.423 --> 23:49.838
I'd say we're both in a somewhat
compromised position, hm?

23:55.517 --> 23:58.805
Story checks out.
Geocell traced calls to Dr. Railly.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.179
They came
from the vicinity of our operation.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.930
What does that mean?

24:03.067 --> 24:06.400
- We need to talk.
- Cassie's not a part of this. She is...

24:06.528 --> 24:09.656
She's gonna tell us everything she knows
about this Cole.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.908
I said talk.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.904
What are you doing?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.790
Enough.

24:21.919 --> 24:25.252
- (BEATING CONTINUES)
- Back away! Now!

24:35.265 --> 24:40.350
We need to torch this place. Everything.
You have no idea what you've just done.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.561
No.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.807
But you're gonna tell me.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.811
Listen to me.
Put me on the phone with Cole right now.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.781
- Not happening.
- I know there's a virus.

24:53.909 --> 24:57.948
It's not going where you sent it.
I need to get him to destroy it.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.197
Right now you're looking like
an accomplice in this.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.619
You don't understand what you've done.

25:03.794 --> 25:07.161
If this is M510 and it's released,

25:07.297 --> 25:10.960
the symptoms might start innocently
enough, a cough, a sneeze,

25:11.093 --> 25:16.213
but the rate of infection from
a single carrier will be exponential.

25:16.348 --> 25:20.011
If just one of the people exposed
reaches a town,

25:20.144 --> 25:25.855
within days the number of infected
people will be in the thousands,

25:25.983 --> 25:27.974
then millions.

25:28.110 --> 25:31.978
Within weeks, everything collapses.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.196
Everyone dies.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.116
How long since you heard
from your courier?

25:47.004 --> 25:51.338
If your op were going as planned,
you wouldn't even be speaking to me.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.298
You need to know
what's going on in Chechnya.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.181
I can help you.

26:05.606 --> 26:09.269
Pratt, you should take a look at these.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.107
Don't move.

26:12.112 --> 26:15.900
You, from the party that night.
What are you doing here?

26:16.033 --> 26:18.775
Trying to stop a plague
that you created.

26:18.952 --> 26:22.865
M510. The Night Room. That's what
you were working on for Goines.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.829
You were his goddamn rolling stone.

26:24.958 --> 26:28.371
We both know Leland didn't die
from a heart attack.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.415
Do they know your friend is a murderer?

26:30.547 --> 26:31.582
Listen to me.

26:31.757 --> 26:37.172
There are people, dangerous people,
trying to get their hands on your virus.

26:37.304 --> 26:41.422
Right now my friend is the only one
who can stop them.

26:41.558 --> 26:45.426
You and I both know exactly
what will happen if your virus gets out.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.644
Dr. Peters, you know Dr. Railly?

26:49.274 --> 26:52.937
- We've crossed paths.
- What do you have to say about this?

26:56.698 --> 27:00.782
This virus
is the deadliest ever created.

27:00.994 --> 27:04.907
If there's the slightest possibility
of it falling into the wrong hands,

27:05.040 --> 27:08.373
I'd listen to what she has to say.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.253
Tap us into Dr. Railly's cellphone.

27:16.593 --> 27:21.178
I half expected an airstrike,
a drone maybe,

27:21.306 --> 27:24.343
SEAL team under the cover of darkness,
but this...

27:24.476 --> 27:25.591
(CHUCKLES)

27:25.727 --> 27:27.979
I guess I should be flattered.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.014
Must have cost a pretty penny
to engineer this.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.734
- (COUGHS)
- Don't flatter yourself.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.399
You're nothing compared to that virus.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.738
M510, made just for guys like you.

27:39.867 --> 27:43.280
Markridge... Oh, I never thought
anyone'd be crazy enough to use it.

27:43.412 --> 27:48.327
You know, the CIA can murder and lie
with impunity in exchange for what?

27:49.376 --> 27:53.244
Order? Progress?
Cellphones and the illusion of safety?

27:53.380 --> 27:55.792
I don't know what your deal is,

27:55.966 --> 28:00.175
but if you or anybody else
who's infected walks out of here alive,

28:00.304 --> 28:03.762
it's over, for everyone.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.759
I never thought that I would meet anyone
more nihilistic than me.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.142
- Still no answer.
- Keep trying.

make contact with the military.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.198
Call Grozny.
Tell Colonel Ivanov.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.243
We've got the American traitor
Adam Wexler.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.203
We want to make a deal.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.749
We give them Wexler in exchange
for a medical helicopter.

28:40.010 --> 28:45.175
He's not breathing.
He's gone. He's dead.

is precisely what the world needs.

The living forget the lies.

29:07.663 --> 29:12.623
It won't reset anything.
Itjust turns us all back into animals.

29:12.751 --> 29:20.123
I expose the truth to the world and
for that I have been labeled a traitor.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.795
A monster.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.920
Maybe I should upload this plague
to the masses.

An analog solution
for a digital problem.

to swat a fly?

are sending helicopters.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.454
- No, no.
- Doctors.

30:00.590 --> 30:04.424
No one can come here. You'll infect
them. This needs to die here with us.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.754
You traded me?

30:05.887 --> 30:09.596

you in exchange for information.

ride it out and die like men,

or you can leave like cowards
and kill everyone you've ever known.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.671
When I'm there,
you can't tell me anything about this.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.640
You can't try to change it.

35:03.810 --> 35:08.053
If I die here with the virus,
the future will be saved.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.147
Isn't there a way to reset this?

35:11.276 --> 35:14.393
- What if you... What if you went...
- No, there's no time.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.236
If we try it again, we might fail.
I'm almost out ofjumps.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.569
I don't know if I can do that.

35:20.702 --> 35:25.537
Yes, you can, Cassie. You can do it.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.949
I know you can, because you already did.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.787
Everything that happened that night
makes sense now.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.424
WOMAN: We've almost got it.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.337
Listen, I wanna tell you something.

35:38.511 --> 35:41.173
- Target acquired.
- It won't make any sense to you now.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.430
But it will the next time you see me.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.265
- OK, OK.
- It's the Keys.

35:49.814 --> 35:54.057
I couldn't tell you before
cos I was too em barrassed, but...

35:54.194 --> 35:56.276
It's the Keys in Florida.

35:57.572 --> 36:04.068
I saw a picture of a beach there
in a magazine once.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.787
That's where I'd go.

36:10.377 --> 36:13.961
Affirmative. We'll monitor it now.

36:14.089 --> 36:18.879
- Cole?
- I'm here. I'm still here.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.966
OK.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.930
I'm glad I got to know you, Cassie.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.856
Predator has been launched.
Tracking the missile.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.655
Hellfire ATS en route.

37:03.513 --> 37:07.927
(RUMBLING)

37:12.564 --> 37:17.149
I don't think you understand
the severity of this situation.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.607
Dr. Railly.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.575
Where's Aaron?

37:24.701 --> 37:26.783
He is on his way to...

37:33.001 --> 37:35.868
We've come to an understanding
with Mr. Marker and Dr. Railly.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.208
Senator Royce and I agreed
that it would be best for everyone

37:39.382 --> 37:41.088
if we just laid this quietly.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.171
We wouldn't want my friends in the press
to get their hands on anything

37:44.345 --> 37:46.552
that would put you gentlemen
in a bad light.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.890
Well, what the hell kind of assurances
do we have that this stays buried?

37:51.019 --> 37:54.261
You guys are the ones who seem
to have trouble keeping your secrets.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.183
We get even a hint of this in the press

37:56.316 --> 38:00.355
and you and the doctor will be
behind bars for a very long time.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.852
Come on.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.831
What are you doing?

38:14.959 --> 38:19.703
Getting rid of anything related to Cole,
the virus, everything.

38:23.593 --> 38:26.380
In a week, when he's here,
what are we gonna tell him?

38:26.513 --> 38:29.095
We have to stick to script.
The virus was stopped.

38:29.265 --> 38:32.098
- There hasn't been an outbreak.
- But we could warn him.

38:32.227 --> 38:35.936
- He could do something differently.
- And risk the outbreak?

38:36.064 --> 38:39.477
Cassie, this is what Cole wanted.

38:54.707 --> 38:59.497
Mm. What's the occasion?
You cleaned up around here.

39:00.880 --> 39:04.919
Yeah, seemed like a good idea
to toss old leads, get a fresh start.

39:05.051 --> 39:10.171
Hey, you know, last week when we were
dancing, I've never done that before.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.762
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- It was nice.

39:11.891 --> 39:12.926
AARON: Cole.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.013
Ah.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.727
What have we got?

39:18.857 --> 39:21.473
It's not good.
Operation Troy has already happened.

39:21.651 --> 39:25.940
A week ago. The day after you left.
The outbreak's already started in Asia.

39:26.072 --> 39:29.860
But there may be a way to stop it.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.575
I got the after-action details
of the operation.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.786
A courier delivered the virus
to the compound

39:35.957 --> 39:39.666
and the CIA was tracking
all of his coordinates and times.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.957
This follows the exact path
the courier took

39:43.089 --> 39:45.375
from a town in Chechnya
to Wexler's compound.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.216
I could go back and fix this.

39:49.345 --> 39:52.382
I can use this to get the courier
before he delivers the virus.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.177
AARON: Yeah.

39:57.437 --> 40:02.022
Hey, I gotta go, but... good luck.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.483
Thanks. Hey, it was good work.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.335
This could actually work.

40:29.636 --> 40:33.254
I need to write the names of these
streets down. I won't remember 'em.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.550
What is this anyway? Russian?

40:35.725 --> 40:40.970
All right, so once I get the virus,
how do I destroy it?

40:42.941 --> 40:45.648
You'll need bleach.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.476
Soak the virus.
The chemicals will kill it.

40:50.865 --> 40:55.905
Hey, take a break for a second.
I... just wanna talk to you.

40:56.037 --> 40:59.120
- I'm gonna splinter any second.
- I know, but...

40:59.248 --> 41:04.663
We could just... be us,
just for a minute.

41:04.837 --> 41:08.750
- Cassie, I'm gonna fix this, OK?
- I know.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.760
What do you think will happen
when this is over?

41:13.888 --> 41:18.678
I know you say that the future
will be saved and that you won't exist,

41:18.851 --> 41:25.097
but... what do you think happens to you?

41:26.109 --> 41:28.646
I don't know.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.358
Wind up a better me in a better place,
I hope.

41:32.490 --> 41:36.699
And what is that, that place?
What does it look like to you?

41:40.581 --> 41:45.621
I was in foster care when I was little

41:45.795 --> 41:49.128
and the other kids used to have
this game they'd play,

41:49.257 --> 41:52.499
talking about where they'd go
if they could go anywhere.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.503
Exotic places mostly,
just stupid kid stuff.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.339
Where was your place?

42:02.562 --> 42:04.644
It's the Keys.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.655
Cole, wait.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.655
What is it?

42:28.087 --> 42:30.294
Good bye.
