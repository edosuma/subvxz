00:45.277 --> 00:48.610
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

00:48.680 --> 00:50.910
<i>We clear on that?</i>

00:52.985 --> 00:56.045
<i>This is a live project.
You're a go.</i>

00:56.121 --> 00:59.386
<i>You're a go.</i>

00:59.458 --> 01:04.920
<i>Training is over.
Training is over.</i>

01:51.476 --> 01:54.468
I'm okay. It's fine.

01:54.546 --> 01:57.276
Just a headache.

02:02.454 --> 02:06.322
<i>You're burning up.</i>

02:19.471 --> 02:21.405
It's okay.

02:23.075 --> 02:25.009
Just a headache.

02:45.998 --> 02:48.990
Anything new?
No.

02:49.067 --> 02:53.060
It's just bits and pieces.

02:55.574 --> 02:57.804
I can hear Conklin's voice,

02:57.876 --> 03:01.937
and there's that photograph, but...

03:03.448 --> 03:06.110
I just can't stay with it.

03:06.184 --> 03:08.448
But you're sure it's not
just a bad dream? It happened.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.852
It was a mission.

03:13.025 --> 03:15.016
And I was there.

03:15.093 --> 03:18.256
You should write it down.

03:20.766 --> 03:23.667
Two years we're scribbling in that
notebook... It hasn't been two years.

03:23.735 --> 03:27.000
It's always bad, and now it's just
the same thing over and over again.

03:27.072 --> 03:32.533
But that's why we write it down. Because
sooner or later, you remember something good.

03:34.813 --> 03:37.805
I do remember something good.

03:37.883 --> 03:40.078
All the time.

04:39.878 --> 04:43.712
<i>I want one final go around.
All teams listen up.</i>

04:43.782 --> 04:47.616
<i>- We are standing by for final green.
- Survey Two, I need to know when you've got eyes.</i>

04:47.686 --> 04:52.089
<i>This is Survey Two. I have eyes.
- Copy that.</i>

04:52.157 --> 04:56.423
<i>Survey One, this is Hub.
Do you have visual contact?</i>

04:57.496 --> 05:00.954
<i>Hub, this is Survey One.
Mobile One is in motion.</i>

05:05.237 --> 05:09.936
<i>Survey Three, that is good.</i>

05:10.008 --> 05:13.808
Hub.
Director Marshall from Langley.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.642
- Langley.
- Stand by, please.

05:17.349 --> 05:21.752
<i>- Martin?
- I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller.</i>

05:21.820 --> 05:25.415
We understand you're using
the full allocation for this buy.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.651
It's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.

05:27.726 --> 05:33.528
For a thief, a mole. If it does nothing more than narrow
the list of suspects, it's a bargain at 10 times the price.

05:33.598 --> 05:36.863
<i>Hub, this is Survey Two.
Escort is breaking off.</i>

05:36.935 --> 05:39.597
<i>Mobile One is entering the building.</i>

05:39.671 --> 05:43.767
Gentlemen, I have the seller on-site and in play.
Quite frankly, there's nothing much more to discuss.

05:50.248 --> 05:53.149
- All right, Pam. Your call.
- Go.

05:53.218 --> 05:55.209
<i>- We're on.
Audio contact only.</i>

05:55.287 --> 05:58.279
<i>Switching to channel one now.</i>

05:58.356 --> 06:00.187
<i>Copy that. It's affirmative.</i>

06:59.918 --> 07:02.318
<i>Hub, Mobile One and seller
have entered the office.</i>

07:02.387 --> 07:03.877
Copy that.

07:17.536 --> 07:20.699
<i>This is everything?</i>

07:55.473 --> 07:57.441
<i>Those were shots.</i>

08:02.981 --> 08:06.314
Survey One, come in. Survey One, I need
to know what happened. What do you see?

08:06.384 --> 08:08.409
<i>- Do you see any shadows? I see nothing.
- What is your visual?</i>

08:08.486 --> 08:12.422
<i>- Get some men in there. Get some men in there right now.
- Pull it up, Kurt.</i>

08:14.225 --> 08:16.785
<i>Eye contact. I don't care if it's visual...
Mobile One, can you copy, please?</i>

08:16.861 --> 08:19.796
- Are you there, Mobile One?
- I'm sorry.

08:19.864 --> 08:24.301
<i>What do you see?</i>

08:40.885 --> 08:43.479
...Petroleum Association's annual
conference here in Berlin...

08:43.554 --> 08:46.547
is Pekos Oil chief executive officer
Yuri Gretkov.

08:46.625 --> 08:51.153
<i>In just six years, Gretkov has turned
Pekos into an oil empire, which in turn...</i>

08:56.434 --> 08:58.664
He's become one of
the wealthiest men in Russia...

08:58.737 --> 09:02.298
after consolidating drilling rights in the
Caspian Sea and gaining control of one of the wo...

09:55.460 --> 09:57.724
How much?

12:30.448 --> 12:33.349
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

12:34.986 --> 12:37.921
He is my friend.
There's been a death in the family.

12:37.989 --> 12:41.186
I wonder if you've seen him.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.530
- Hey.
- Get in.

13:26.604 --> 13:28.595
<i>- What's wrong?
- We're blown.</i>

13:28.673 --> 13:31.608
How? We pushed it. We got lazy.

13:44.822 --> 13:46.255
<i>Idiot!</i>

13:49.093 --> 13:51.926
- All right. That's twice now
I've seen the same guy.

13:51.996 --> 13:53.987
I saw him in town.
He was at the telegraph office.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.397
Are you sure? How-How can
you be sure? It's just wrong.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.300
The guy, the car he's driving,
what he's wearing... it's just wrong.

14:02.907 --> 14:06.104
<i>Look, Jason, let's stay calm. It
could be anybody. This is real.</i>

14:06.177 --> 14:09.806
This is real. That's him.
That's him right there.

14:09.881 --> 14:12.873
<i>- Get your head down.
Silver Hyundai. Get your head down.</i>

14:32.537 --> 14:34.368
How far is he?

14:36.874 --> 14:38.865
How far?

14:40.278 --> 14:42.143
A hundred meters.

14:59.964 --> 15:02.057
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

15:03.301 --> 15:05.929
Switch.

15:07.338 --> 15:10.330
Just head to the bridge.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.885
<i>- Turn here. Cut through the field.
- Hang on.</i>

16:20.378 --> 16:23.779
All right, you keep going to the shack.
I'll meet you there in one hour.

16:23.848 --> 16:27.181
I'm gonna bail out on the other side of this
bridge. It's the only way he can follow us.

16:27.251 --> 16:29.583
What if it's not who you think
it is? It's them. It's Treadstone.

16:29.654 --> 16:32.145
Jason, don't do it.
Look, Marie, I warned 'em.

16:32.223 --> 16:34.521
I don't want you to do it. I told them what
would happen if they didn't leave us alone.

16:34.592 --> 16:38.255
- It's never gonna be over like this. I don't want...
- We don't have a choice.

16:38.329 --> 16:40.297
Yes, you do.

18:58.069 --> 19:00.902
Thank you.

19:00.972 --> 19:04.965
Two of these explosive charges placed on
the power lines, and one of them failed.

19:05.042 --> 19:07.101
The fingerprints from the one
that didn't go off.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.305
<i>And the Germans can't match it?
No. Nobody's got it.</i>

19:09.380 --> 19:13.783
<i>We checked out every database we could
access. But we're hooked into Langley now.</i>

19:13.851 --> 19:16.183
Run it.
Okay.

19:25.563 --> 19:27.497
What the hell's Treadstone?

19:29.533 --> 19:33.094
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

22:05.523 --> 22:10.517
Two men dead, three million
in cash gone, no Neski files,

22:10.594 --> 22:12.494
<i>and all very public.</i>

22:12.563 --> 22:15.691
This is still a clandestine agency, no?

22:15.766 --> 22:17.700
I don't view this event
as a failure.

22:17.768 --> 22:20.464
You call it a success?
We have a lead.

22:20.538 --> 22:24.531
A fingerprint left by the assassin.
He's one of us.

22:26.343 --> 22:29.972
- Who is it?
- What can you tell me about Treadstone?

22:30.047 --> 22:34.006
Treadstone?
It's where the trail dead-ends.

22:34.084 --> 22:37.019
If you want an answer,
you're going to have to give me...

22:37.087 --> 22:40.318
a level-five S.C.I. Access.

22:42.927 --> 22:44.895
We have a lead, Marty.

22:47.565 --> 22:51.023
All right.
You've got your clearance.

22:51.101 --> 22:54.730
But you're on
a very short leash.

22:54.805 --> 22:58.832
And you'll give a full report to the group.
I wanna know where you're going with this.

22:58.909 --> 23:01.537
Sir.

24:18.222 --> 24:20.417
<i>Ward?</i>

24:20.491 --> 24:22.152
Yes?
Pamela Landy.

24:22.226 --> 24:24.626
Hey, Pam.
What can I do for you?

24:24.695 --> 24:27.186
I was hoping you had some
time for me. Time for what?

24:27.264 --> 24:32.566
- I'm free right now, actually.
- That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule.

24:36.140 --> 24:39.598
<i>Excuse me. I need to, uh...
Excuse me. Can I help you?</i>

24:39.677 --> 24:41.941
<i>Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Abbott.
Twenty minutes?</i>

24:42.012 --> 24:44.810
See ya.

24:52.523 --> 24:55.014
Operation Treadstone.
Never heard of it.

24:55.092 --> 24:59.859
That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam,
I think you might've wandered past your pay grade.

24:59.930 --> 25:04.594
That's a warrant from Director Marshall
granting me unrestricted access to...

25:04.668 --> 25:07.637
<i>all personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.</i>

25:10.641 --> 25:14.133
So, what are we looking at?
I wanna know about it.

25:14.211 --> 25:17.203
Know about it? It was a
kill squad. Black-on-black.

25:17.281 --> 25:21.775
We closed it down two years ago. Nobody wants
to know about Treadstone. Not around here.

25:21.852 --> 25:25.515
<i>So I think you better take this back to Marty
and let him know exactly what you're doing.</i>

25:25.589 --> 25:29.787
He does. I've been down to the
archives. I have the files, Ward.

25:31.528 --> 25:34.224
<i>- Let's talk about Conklin.
- What are you after, Pam?</i>

25:34.298 --> 25:37.859
You wanna fry me?
You want my desk. Is that it?

25:37.935 --> 25:39.732
I wanna know what happened.
What happened?

25:39.803 --> 25:44.797
Jason Bourne happened. You got
the files. Then let's cut the crap.

25:44.875 --> 25:48.868
<i>Conklin had these guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.</i>

25:50.147 --> 25:54.140
<i>Bourne was his number-one. The guy went
for a job, screwed the op, never came back.</i>

25:54.218 --> 25:59.315
<i>Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find
Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways.</i>

25:59.390 --> 26:02.655
So you had Conklin killed?
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

26:02.726 --> 26:05.217
I've given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency.

26:05.295 --> 26:08.196
I've shoveled shit on four continents.
I'm due to retire next year.

26:08.265 --> 26:11.257
But if you think I'm gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this,

26:11.335 --> 26:14.827
you can go to hell... and Marshall too.

26:15.839 --> 26:18.569
<i>It had to be done.</i>

26:18.642 --> 26:21.440
<i>And Bourne? Where is he now?
- Dead in a ditch.</i>

26:21.512 --> 26:24.208
<i>- Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu. Who knows?
- I think I do.</i>

26:24.281 --> 26:26.749
<i>I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.</i>

26:26.817 --> 26:29.445
<i>During the buy, both our case officer
and the seller were killed.</i>

26:29.520 --> 26:32.580
They were killed byJason Bourne.

26:35.926 --> 26:37.860
They're ready for us upstairs.

27:17.401 --> 27:23.135
Seven years ago, $20 million of C.I.A. Funds
disappeared during a wire transfer through Moscow.

27:23.207 --> 27:28.645
In the investigation that followed, we were
contacted by a Russian politician, Vladimir Neski.

27:28.712 --> 27:32.705
Neski claimed we had a leak and that
we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

27:32.783 --> 27:35.149
And were we?
We never found out.

27:35.219 --> 27:37.517
We were negotiating a meet
with Mr. Neski when he was killed.

27:37.588 --> 27:39.556
- By who?
- His wife.

27:39.623 --> 27:42.285
<i>The case had gone cold until a month ago
when we found a source.</i>

27:42.359 --> 27:45.920
Another Russian in Berlin who claimed
to have access to the Neski murder files.

27:45.996 --> 27:48.123
<i>We thought we had
another bite at the apple.</i>

27:51.401 --> 27:55.599
<i>Turns out the assassin
was one of our own... Jason Bourne.</i>

27:56.874 --> 27:59.866
<i>I know Treadstone's not
a very popular subject around here,</i>

27:59.943 --> 28:02.468
but we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper.

28:02.546 --> 28:05.947
This is Conklin's personal computer.

28:06.016 --> 28:11.477
<i>His Treadstone files are bloated with code keys and
case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for.</i>

28:11.555 --> 28:15.548
Buried in the hard drive, we found a deleted
file with an account number to a bank in Zurich.

28:15.626 --> 28:21.360
<i>At the time ofhis death, he was sitting on a
personal account in the amount of $ 760,000.</i>

28:21.431 --> 28:26.164
You know what his budget was? We were throwing
money at him and asking him to keep it dark.

28:26.236 --> 28:29.228
- It was his own account. He was up to something.
- This is supposed to be definitive?

28:29.306 --> 28:32.207
<i>What's definitive is that I just lost two
people in Berlin. So what's your theory?</i>

28:32.276 --> 28:36.838
Conklin's reaching out from the grave to
protect his good name? The man is dead.

28:36.914 --> 28:40.179
- No one's disputing that, Ward.
- For Christ's sake, Marty, you knew Conklin.

28:40.250 --> 28:44.209
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

28:44.288 --> 28:46.222
Cut to the chase, Pam.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.622
<i>I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together,</i>

28:48.692 --> 28:51.855
that Bourne's still involved and that whatever
information I was trying to buy in Berlin...

28:51.929 --> 28:54.921
was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

28:54.998 --> 28:57.159
How's that scan?

28:58.135 --> 29:00.069
<i>Excuse me, sir,
but you're not gonna believe this.</i>

29:00.137 --> 29:03.106
Jason Bourne's passport
just popped up on the grid in Naples.

29:07.344 --> 29:10.211
Okay. Contact Naples. They need
to know who they're dealing with.

29:10.280 --> 29:14.046
Find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there.

29:18.755 --> 29:21.747
Nah, it's nothing. Some guy's name
came up on the computer.

29:24.228 --> 29:28.062
Yeah. Hey, listen, Tom,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

29:28.131 --> 29:30.429
All right.

29:45.449 --> 29:48.282
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the U.S. Consulate.

29:48.352 --> 29:50.752
I just have a few questions for you.

30:00.898 --> 30:03.731
You're coming out of Tangier.
Is that correct?

30:09.740 --> 30:13.403
What's the, uh, nature
of your visit to Naples?

30:34.965 --> 30:39.129
Look, I don't know what you did, and
I don't know who you're working for.

30:39.202 --> 30:41.136
But I promise you this...

30:41.204 --> 30:44.196
you're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

30:51.715 --> 30:55.014
This is Nevins.

30:55.085 --> 30:58.282
This is Tom Cronin, C.I. Operations Officer
calling from Langley, Virginia.

30:58.355 --> 31:01.791
- Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody?
- Yes, I do.

31:01.858 --> 31:04.554
Listen, he's an agency priority target.

31:06.630 --> 31:09.463
Call me back as soon as
he's secure. I understand.

31:53.110 --> 31:56.944
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

31:57.014 --> 32:00.006
<i>- He's being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate.</i>

32:13.997 --> 32:17.364
- Hello.
- This is Pamela Landy, C.I. Supervisor.

32:17.434 --> 32:20.028
<i>Where do we stand?</i>

32:20.103 --> 32:22.901
I, uh, think he got away.

32:22.973 --> 32:25.703
Damn it.

32:25.776 --> 32:29.439
- Have you locked down the area?
- Locked it down? No. No.

32:29.513 --> 32:32.573
This is, uh... This is Italy.
They don't exactly lock down...

32:32.649 --> 32:36.085
- How long have you worked for the agency?
- Me? For four years.

32:36.153 --> 32:40.954
<i>If you ever wanna make it to five, you're gonna listen
to me real close. Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

32:41.024 --> 32:44.323
Last week in Berlin he assassinated two
men... one a highly experienced field officer.

32:44.394 --> 32:47.625
I want you to secure that area. I want any
evidence secured, and I want it done right now.

32:47.697 --> 32:50.097
Is that clear?
Yes, sir... ma'am.

32:50.167 --> 32:53.568
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes,
which means you're gonna call me back in 30.

32:53.637 --> 32:56.231
<i>And when I ask you where we stand,
I had better be impressed.</i>

33:01.011 --> 33:03.172
- Berlin?
- I already have a team in place there.

33:03.246 --> 33:05.840
<i>I doubt that Bourne's in Naples
ready to start a family.</i>

33:05.916 --> 33:08.510
<i>- You have no idea what you're getting into.
- Do you have any idea?</i>

33:08.585 --> 33:11.952
<i>From the minute he left Treadstone, he's killed and
eluded every single person that you've sent to find him.</i>

33:12.022 --> 33:15.514
You read a couple of files on Jason Bourne, and
that makes you an expert? This is my case, Ward.

33:15.592 --> 33:19.255
<i>Enough. I want you both
on that plane.</i>

33:19.329 --> 33:23.527
<i>We are, all of us, going to do what we were either
too lazy or inept to do the last time around.</i>

33:23.600 --> 33:26.763
We're gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down.

33:26.837 --> 33:30.432
I'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

33:30.507 --> 33:34.466
- Is that definitive enough for you?
- Yes.

33:37.848 --> 33:41.181
<i>Jason Bourne
is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

33:41.251 --> 33:44.982
<i>Last week in Berlin he assassinated two
men... one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

33:45.055 --> 33:46.750
I want that area...

33:46.823 --> 33:49.485
<i>...he assassinated two men...
one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

33:49.559 --> 33:53.222
<i>I want that area secured. I want any evidence
secured, and I want it done right now...</i>

34:12.649 --> 34:14.775
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

34:18.788 --> 34:22.280
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

34:23.994 --> 34:26.188
<i>We clear on that?
We clear on that?</i>

35:39.936 --> 35:42.496
<i>You'd been working at Treadstone
for three years,</i>

35:42.572 --> 35:44.506
<i>and your cover at the time was what?</i>

35:44.574 --> 35:47.270
That I was an American student in Paris.

35:47.344 --> 35:50.279
And what exactly did your job
with Treadstone in Paris consist of?

35:50.347 --> 35:54.078
<i>I had two responsibilities. One was
to coordinate logistical operations.</i>

35:54.150 --> 35:56.311
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

35:56.386 --> 35:58.854
<i>Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.</i>

35:58.922 --> 36:01.857
- Because of what they had been through, they were prone to a variety of problems.
- What kind?

36:01.925 --> 36:05.918
Depression, anger,
compulsive behaviors.

36:05.996 --> 36:09.932
They had physical symptoms.
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.332
- Amnesia?
- Before Bourne? No.

36:17.574 --> 36:20.737
The plane's ready.
There's a car waiting for you.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.801
- Good luck.
- No. You were his local contact.

36:22.879 --> 36:26.440
You were with him the night Conklin died.
You're coming with us.

37:28.111 --> 37:33.777
- Langley pulled an image out of Naples.
It's uploading right now.

37:33.850 --> 37:35.613
It's coming in now.

37:36.753 --> 37:39.551
<i>I need clearance.
- He's not hiding, that's for sure.</i>

37:39.622 --> 37:42.056
- Why Naples? Why now?
- Could be random.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.218
- Maybe he's running.
- On his own passport?

37:44.294 --> 37:46.956
- What is he actually doing?
- He's making his first mistake.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.759
It's not a mistake.

37:49.999 --> 37:53.332
They don't make mistakes.
They don't do random.

37:53.403 --> 37:55.894
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

37:55.972 --> 37:58.463
<i>The objective and targets always came
from us. Who's giving them to him now?</i>

37:58.541 --> 38:00.873
Scary version?

38:00.944 --> 38:03.276
He is.

39:01.938 --> 39:06.102
- I emptied it.
- It felt a little light.

39:06.176 --> 39:07.871
Put it down.

39:13.183 --> 39:18.177
- Front.
- Sorry. Old habits.

39:20.523 --> 39:23.185
Use your teeth.
Ah.

39:33.837 --> 39:36.772
Word in the ether was
you'd lost your memory.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.831
You still should've moved.

39:41.845 --> 39:44.678
- What do you want?
- Conklin.

39:44.747 --> 39:46.681
He's dead.

39:46.749 --> 39:51.482
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you
walked out. So who's running Treadstone now?

39:51.554 --> 39:55.149
Nobody. They shut it down.

39:55.225 --> 39:59.252
It's over. We're the last two.

40:04.133 --> 40:06.328
If it's over,
then why are they still after me?

40:06.402 --> 40:09.030
- I don't know.
- Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

40:09.105 --> 40:12.336
- I don't know who that is.
- Pamela Landy and Berlin. What's going on in Berlin?

40:12.408 --> 40:15.241
<i>I don't know.</i>

40:15.311 --> 40:17.802
Why would I lie?

40:41.337 --> 40:43.532
I thought you were here to kill me.

40:46.209 --> 40:50.305
What'd you do?
I'm sorry.

40:50.380 --> 40:52.473
Did you call it in?

40:55.952 --> 40:58.477
Get up. Come on.

41:01.658 --> 41:04.991
You have a car out front? The
keys are in my coat pocket.

41:05.061 --> 41:06.995
But we should...
What?

41:07.063 --> 41:09.463
<i>- Go out the back.
I have another car.</i>

45:41.337 --> 45:45.501
Pamela Landy.

45:47.910 --> 45:51.243
<i>Nein, mein Herr.
Danke.</i>

45:56.986 --> 46:00.683
Pamela Landy.

46:00.756 --> 46:03.054
<i>Nein.</i>

46:11.334 --> 46:13.029
<i>Pamela Landy, bitte.</i>

46:15.872 --> 46:17.737
<i>Ja.</i>

46:49.238 --> 46:52.571
Pamela Landy, please.
One moment, please.

46:52.642 --> 46:56.305
Thank you.

46:56.379 --> 46:59.371
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

46:59.448 --> 47:02.349
<i>Just one second, please.</i>

47:02.418 --> 47:05.581
Hello?

47:06.555 --> 47:09.683
Hello?

47:09.759 --> 47:14.492
I'm sorry, sir. The phone's busy
right now. Just try later. Thank you.

48:01.911 --> 48:05.312
<i>Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?</i>

48:05.381 --> 48:08.009
<i>Now, I wanna break this out
in boxes.</i>

48:08.084 --> 48:12.020
<i>Naples outbound. Check everything. Flights,
trains, police reports. That's box one.</i>

48:12.088 --> 48:13.885
- Teddy, that's yours.
- Got it.

48:17.093 --> 48:19.527
<i>Box number two.
Call it "prior connections. "</i>

48:19.595 --> 48:22.325
I want to rerun all Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

48:24.967 --> 48:27.731
<i>Kim, box three.
I want to identify his method of travel.</i>

48:27.803 --> 48:30.363
<i>Stay on the local cops. We need a
vehicle, a parking ticket, something.</i>

48:30.439 --> 48:35.001
Langley's offered to upload any satellite
imaging we need, so let's find a target for them.

48:37.513 --> 48:41.711
<i>Danny, box four. I need fresh eyes. Review
the buy where we lost the Neski files.</i>

48:41.784 --> 48:46.448
Timeline it with what we know about Bourne's
movements. Turn it upside down and see what we find.

48:48.791 --> 48:53.524
<i>Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life with total control
for all those years. We should be a step ahead ofhim.</i>

48:53.596 --> 48:56.258
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

49:16.218 --> 49:20.052
- Pamela Landy.
- This is Jason Bourne.

49:21.791 --> 49:24.658
<i>- Bourne?
- It's Bourne. We need 90 seconds to triangulate his position.</i>

49:24.727 --> 49:27.127
What do you want?

49:29.298 --> 49:31.960
Are you running Treadstone?

49:35.137 --> 49:38.265
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago. You know that.

49:38.340 --> 49:40.934
Then who's planning
the missions now?

49:41.010 --> 49:44.377
There are no missions. It's over.

49:46.015 --> 49:49.280
- Then what do you want with me?
- Berlin.

49:51.854 --> 49:54.618
Have you forgotten
what happened in Berlin?

49:56.025 --> 49:59.358
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.
You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

49:59.428 --> 50:02.090
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

50:03.599 --> 50:08.263
<i>- Neski... Vladimir Neski...
Vladimir Neski...</i>

50:17.680 --> 50:18.840
Bourne?

50:21.617 --> 50:23.346
<i>I wanna come in.</i>

50:25.121 --> 50:29.558
<i>- Okay. How do you wanna do it?
- We need 35 seconds.</i>

50:29.625 --> 50:34.358
- I need someone I know to bring me in.
- Who?

50:34.430 --> 50:37.399
<i>There was a girl in Paris.
She was part of the program.</i>

50:38.300 --> 50:42.828
<i>She used to handle logistics. Alexander
Strasse, 30 minutes, under the World Clock.</i>

50:42.905 --> 50:46.068
<i>Send her alone.
Give her your phone.</i>

50:46.142 --> 50:48.702
What if I can't find her?

50:48.777 --> 50:51.905
It's easy.
She's standing right next to you.

51:05.895 --> 51:08.489
- There's just so many areas...
- It's a very simple layout.

51:09.565 --> 51:11.430
<i>Get the second quadrant.
Pull it out.</i>

51:11.500 --> 51:14.936
<i>Where is it? Get the second quadrant,
please. Pull it all the way up.</i>

51:15.004 --> 51:17.768
<i>Clock is right here...
Shit, he's put her in the middle of everything.</i>

51:17.840 --> 51:20.775
This is a security nightmare. There is
no way we are going to get her covered...

51:20.843 --> 51:24.711
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We
need snipers, D.O.D., whatever they've got.

51:24.780 --> 51:28.910
No snipers. You put snipers on the roof
and it'll scare him off, and I need answers.

51:28.984 --> 51:33.182
- You can't really believe he wants to come in.
- He knows something about the Neski case.

51:33.255 --> 51:37.055
- I'm not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is.
- Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close.

51:37.126 --> 51:39.287
Are we talking about protecting Nicky
or killing Bourne?

51:39.361 --> 51:44.355
- We're talking about killing Bourne.
- We're talking about the next dead body. It might be Nicky. It will be someone.

51:44.433 --> 51:46.799
You're not hearing me.
Bourne dead gives me nothing.

51:50.139 --> 51:52.937
Can I talk to you privately?

51:58.247 --> 52:00.909
- What?
- I know how you're feeling.

52:00.983 --> 52:03.611
You lost two men in Berlin
and you want it to mean something.

52:03.686 --> 52:05.677
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

52:05.754 --> 52:10.157
Nothing in those files makes their
sacrifice worthwhile. You have to let go.

52:10.226 --> 52:13.821
We're professionals.
When an operation goes bad, we tie it off.

52:13.896 --> 52:18.060
If there's something you're not telling me, I want it
now before I send that girl out there. Do you understand?

52:21.403 --> 52:24.372
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

52:38.654 --> 52:40.747
What do you want to do?

52:41.824 --> 52:44.486
Put the snipers in place.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.723
If things go bad,
we take him out.

52:47.796 --> 52:49.593
You got it.

53:28.637 --> 53:32.266
Hub, this is Survey One.
We have a crowd moving in.

53:32.341 --> 53:36.573
<i>- It's some sort of protest march.
- I'm sorry. This is as close as I can get.</i>

53:36.645 --> 53:40.581
<i>- Survey Two, can you get in any closer?
- Kurt, make sure the south end is covered.</i>

53:40.649 --> 53:43.618
<i>Roger. Affirmative. Copy that.</i>

53:57.766 --> 54:02.328
Hello. There's a tram coming
towards you. Get on it.

54:02.404 --> 54:05.271
- She's moving to the tram.
- Where's it going?

54:05.341 --> 54:08.435
<i>The tram is going
to Alexanderplatz Station.</i>

54:13.415 --> 54:16.942
<i>Survey Five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.</i>

54:20.923 --> 54:23.483
<i>Hub, this is Survey Two,
she's getting on a tram.</i>

54:23.559 --> 54:25.618
- She's getting on the tram.
- Zoom in on the tram.

54:25.694 --> 54:28.356
<i>- Bourne's on the tram.
- I don't think he's on the tram.</i>

54:28.430 --> 54:30.830
<i>He's on the tram.</i>

54:32.701 --> 54:36.102
- Send them in to follow.
Tell them to keep their distance.

54:36.171 --> 54:38.139
<i>Okay, Delta, let's go.
Get on it.</i>

54:38.207 --> 54:41.506
Come on. Let's go.

54:41.577 --> 54:45.206
<i>- Tell her to hurry.
- There's nothing on the south side.</i>

55:00.303 --> 55:03.397
Alexanderplatz Station,
25 seconds.

55:18.121 --> 55:22.285
<i>This is Survey Three. There's a lot of protesters
here. There's no way we can cover out there.</i>

55:24.260 --> 55:27.058
- Get her out of there.
- Go! Delta, move! Now!

55:44.814 --> 55:48.750
<i>- She's not here. She's gone.
- Goddamn it!</i>

55:48.818 --> 55:51.048
<i>- They are not on the tram.
- He's one guy!</i>

55:51.120 --> 55:54.419
<i>Jason, please don't hurt me.
What were my words?</i>

55:54.491 --> 55:57.051
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

55:57.126 --> 56:00.618
I did. I swear. Jason, I
told them that I believed you.

56:00.697 --> 56:03.063
I'm gonna ask you
some some simple questions.

56:03.132 --> 56:06.932
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

56:07.003 --> 56:09.665
- Delta, give me something.
- They're on it! They're on it!

56:09.739 --> 56:11.969
Who's Pamela Landy?

56:12.041 --> 56:15.499
<i>She's a task force chief.
- Is she running Treadstone?</i>

56:15.578 --> 56:18.342
No, she's the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?

56:18.414 --> 56:22.407
<i>Last week an agency field officer tried
to make a buy off of one ofher ops.</i>

56:22.485 --> 56:26.148
He was trying to sell out a mole or
something and you got to him before we did.

56:26.222 --> 56:28.349
<i>- I killed him?
- You left a print.</i>

56:28.424 --> 56:31.416
<i>There were partial prints that trace
back to Treadstone. They know it was you.</i>

56:31.494 --> 56:35.191
<i>- That is insane.
- Why are you doing this? Why come back now?</i>

56:35.265 --> 56:37.790
Landy will find...
Stop. Stop.

56:37.867 --> 56:42.099
Last week I was 4,000 miles away
in India, watching Marie die.

56:42.171 --> 56:45.072
<i>They came for me,
and they killed her instead.</i>

56:45.141 --> 56:47.132
<i>This ends now.</i>

56:52.115 --> 56:55.278
<i>Find her.</i>

56:55.351 --> 56:59.310
- What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?

56:59.389 --> 57:03.155
- Please! I'm only here because of Paris. Abbott dragged us...
- Abbott? Who's Abbott?

57:03.226 --> 57:05.194
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.

57:05.261 --> 57:07.058
Is he here in Berlin?
Yes.

57:07.130 --> 57:09.064
Did he run Treadstone?

57:09.132 --> 57:12.192
Did he run Treadstone? Yes.
Conklin reported to him.

57:12.268 --> 57:14.202
Please. Please, I swear...

57:14.270 --> 57:18.331
What was Landy buying? What kind of
files? Conklin... Stuff on Conklin.

57:18.408 --> 57:21.343
It was something to do
with a Russian politician.

57:27.884 --> 57:30.853
Neski. Wh-What? What
are you talking about?

57:33.389 --> 57:35.653
<i>Training is over... Training is over...
Training is over...</i>

57:35.725 --> 57:38.250
When... When was I here in Berlin?

57:38.328 --> 57:41.229
What are you talking about? For
Treadstone. I did a job here.

57:41.297 --> 57:44.198
When? No, you never
worked in Berlin before.

57:44.267 --> 57:46.599
My first job. In Berlin.
You know my file.

57:46.669 --> 57:49.536
- You've never worked Berlin before.
- My first job!

57:49.606 --> 57:52.268
No, your first assignment was
Geneva. You fucking people!

57:52.342 --> 57:55.505
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, Nicky!

57:55.578 --> 57:58.672
It's not in your file!
- I know I was here!

57:58.748 --> 58:01.581
<i>No, I swear... Oh, please.!</i>

58:19.535 --> 58:22.936
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's Alexanderplatz.

58:23.006 --> 58:26.874
<i>We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They're all converging in a five-block radius.</i>

58:26.943 --> 58:28.934
Over here, Luftschulzbunker.
That was an old war shelter.

58:29.012 --> 58:32.413
How many men are out there? Two coming down the back
stairs. The rest, they're fanned out for a search.

58:32.482 --> 58:35.246
<i>- What's our security situation here?
- Where, "here"? The ground?</i>

58:35.318 --> 58:39.311
<i>Here here. In the building. Check everything, and
recheck all the stairwells, hallways, everything.</i>

58:39.389 --> 58:41.789
It's done.

58:41.858 --> 58:46.295
<i>Okay, let's go public.
Release his photo to the Berlin police.</i>

58:46.362 --> 58:49.729
- And check out his story about the girlfriend in India too.
- I'm on it.

58:49.799 --> 58:53.496
You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela,
and you don't have the shoes for it.

58:54.704 --> 58:57.639
- He said he didn't know anything about Berlin.
- He knew that Nicky was wearing a wire.

58:57.707 --> 59:01.575
- Don't you think that was for our benefit?
- He didn't sound like a man in control to me.

59:01.644 --> 59:03.942
<i>We know he was in Berlin.</i>

59:04.013 --> 59:06.311
His mind is broken.
We broke it. And now...

59:06.382 --> 59:09.408
What now? Terminate him? You've been
pushing that agenda ever since we got here.

59:09.485 --> 59:13.012
- He also said you were running Treadstone. Should we believe that too?
- I'm convinced Bourne knows something.

59:13.089 --> 59:15.080
He knows that you're after him,

59:15.158 --> 59:19.424
and in the interest of self-preservation
you might start with that.

59:19.495 --> 59:22.191
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?

59:35.378 --> 59:37.369
I need to show you
something.

01:01:23.519 --> 01:01:27.478
All right, I finished my box work, but I
wanted to show you before I showed Landy.

01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:29.491
Came down here last night...

01:01:29.559 --> 01:01:31.493
because none of this
is making any sense.

01:01:31.561 --> 01:01:33.995
I'm with you... Conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?

01:01:34.063 --> 01:01:37.829
I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.301
All right, you put a four-gam Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:43.565
You know that.

01:01:43.639 --> 01:01:48.667
There were two charges that were supposed to go off
simultaneously. The second one, over here, didn't go off.

01:01:48.744 --> 01:01:52.680
Now, first of all, this is nothing.
It's a sub-line for the breaker above.

01:01:52.748 --> 01:01:55.182
And second, why put the charge
all the way down here?

01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:59.950
If you're good enough to get in here and handle the
gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.

01:02:00.022 --> 01:02:01.956
Bourne would know.

01:02:02.024 --> 01:02:04.549
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No.

01:02:04.627 --> 01:02:08.529
But what if somebody were trying to cover
their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne?

01:02:08.598 --> 01:02:11.590
What if Bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?

01:02:14.604 --> 01:02:16.834
- Show me again.
- All right.

01:02:16.906 --> 01:02:18.999
Well, you put...

01:02:43.466 --> 01:02:46.128
<i>Pull over. He's getting out.</i>

01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:53.505
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?</i>

01:02:53.576 --> 01:02:57.376
This is a live project,
and you're a go.

01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:02.908
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.501
- Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
- I want to get a room for the night.

01:03:24.573 --> 01:03:27.565
Do you have a reservation?
No.

01:03:32.682 --> 01:03:37.051
Actually, is room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.

01:03:41.357 --> 01:03:44.849
<i>I'm sorry, sir. That room is
occupied. How about room 644?</i>

01:03:44.927 --> 01:03:47.452
<i>It's right across the hall.</i>

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.464
<i>Sir?</i>

01:03:49.532 --> 01:03:53.764
644?
That's fine. Thank you.

01:03:53.836 --> 01:03:57.897
I just need your passport
and signature right here, please.

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.366
Have a nice night.

01:04:33.976 --> 01:04:35.671
<i>Ja.</i>

01:05:02.371 --> 01:05:04.805
<i>Berlin Polizei.</i>

01:05:20.856 --> 01:05:23.324
Where?
Brecker Hotel.

01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:25.292
Okay, we're there.
Take the van!

01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:27.625
- Brecker? How far?
- About five or six minutes.

01:06:04.934 --> 01:06:07.994
<i>Hi.!</i>

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:10.971
Hey!

01:06:47.276 --> 01:06:50.143
<i>Congratulations, soldier.</i>

01:06:50.212 --> 01:06:52.578
Training is over.

01:07:34.056 --> 01:07:36.991
<i>Polizei.! Polizei.!</i>

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:54.100
Go!

01:08:19.768 --> 01:08:24.636
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark T-shirt, dark pants.

01:08:24.707 --> 01:08:28.939
The cops out there wanna corral all the
guests together and check 'em out one by one.

01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:31.206
That will really work.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:34.305
What the hell's he doing here? Maybe
he just wanted to stay the night.

01:09:10.019 --> 01:09:12.350
<i>Polizei.!</i>

01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:25.862
Polizei! Polizei!

01:09:31.273 --> 01:09:34.207
<i>Polizei.! Polizei.!</i>

01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:17.148
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

01:12:13.969 --> 01:12:15.903
They missed him?
Yeah, so far.

01:12:15.971 --> 01:12:18.906
But they found Nicky. She's back
at the Westin. Bourne let her go.

01:12:18.974 --> 01:12:20.737
He let her go?
Yeah.

01:12:22.244 --> 01:12:26.146
Where's Danny Zorn? He ought to
head over there and debrief her.

01:12:26.215 --> 01:12:28.149
Why did Bourne come here?

01:12:28.217 --> 01:12:31.448
We don't know yet. Landy's
upstairs in one of the rooms.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.988
<i>She said she'd call you
when she's done.</i>

01:12:36.658 --> 01:12:38.649
Okay.

01:12:40.062 --> 01:12:44.761
I think I'll, uh... take a cab
back to the hotel.

01:12:49.872 --> 01:12:52.466
<i>So, the room he checked into
was across the hall.</i>

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:54.475
Mmm.

01:12:54.543 --> 01:12:56.773
Why would he come in here?

01:13:05.087 --> 01:13:08.454
What are you thinking? I
recognize this room from a photo.

01:13:10.025 --> 01:13:13.426
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

01:13:14.596 --> 01:13:17.690
This is where
his wife killed him?

01:13:17.766 --> 01:13:20.098
Do you still think
his wife killed him?

01:13:29.011 --> 01:13:31.206
Guess he got out
through this window.

01:13:32.714 --> 01:13:35.649
We just got word
from the Berlin police.

01:13:35.717 --> 01:13:37.548
They found Danny Zorn's body.

01:13:42.558 --> 01:13:46.619
I want you two to stay on Bourne.
Check everything that's out there.

01:13:46.695 --> 01:13:49.186
Call Abbott. Tell him to
wait for me in his hotel.

01:13:49.264 --> 01:13:51.425
I'm coming to see him.

01:14:19.962 --> 01:14:22.590
<i>- Da.
- It's me.</i>

01:14:22.664 --> 01:14:24.655
They're onto Neski.

01:14:25.968 --> 01:14:28.903
This is not a clean phone. They
can't prove anything without Bourne.

01:14:28.971 --> 01:14:31.872
Kill Bourne,
and you kill this investigation.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:36.377
I'm afraid, Ward, the time has
come for us to part company.

01:14:36.445 --> 01:14:41.041
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with 20 million in stolen C.I.A. Seed money.

01:14:41.116 --> 01:14:43.516
You owe me.
I gave you your cut.

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:45.746
We both got rich.

01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:47.914
I don't owe you anything.

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.551
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. You hear me?

01:14:51.627 --> 01:14:53.561
He's still out there.
Now get him.

01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:55.187
GetJason...

01:15:15.417 --> 01:15:18.409
I don't suppose it would do me
much good to cry for help, huh?

01:15:20.422 --> 01:15:22.413
Not much.

01:15:23.659 --> 01:15:26.253
You killed her.

01:15:26.328 --> 01:15:28.262
It was a mistake.

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:31.128
It was supposed to be you.

01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:35.135
There were files linking me
to the Neski murder.

01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:39.162
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you,

01:15:39.241 --> 01:15:41.300
they'd be chasing a ghost
for 10 years.

01:15:41.376 --> 01:15:43.310
So we got in the way.

01:15:43.378 --> 01:15:46.745
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?

01:15:46.815 --> 01:15:48.749
You killed Marie...

01:15:48.817 --> 01:15:50.751
the minute
you climbed into her car.

01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:53.754
The minute you entered her life,
she was dead.

01:15:53.822 --> 01:15:56.757
I told you people
to leave us alone.

01:15:56.825 --> 01:15:59.259
I fell off the grid.
I was halfway around the world.

01:15:59.327 --> 01:16:02.194
<i>There's no place
it won't catch up to you.</i>

01:16:02.264 --> 01:16:04.698
It's how every story ends.

01:16:04.766 --> 01:16:07.963
It's what you are, Jason...
a killer.

01:16:08.036 --> 01:16:10.470
<i>You always will be.</i>

01:16:12.574 --> 01:16:15.634
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on.!
Do it.! Do it.!</i>

01:16:17.813 --> 01:16:20.281
She wouldn't want me to.

01:16:20.348 --> 01:16:22.407
That's the only reason
you're alive.

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.625
I'm a patriot.
I serve my country.

01:17:41.696 --> 01:17:44.961
And Danny Zorn? What was he? Unlucky.

01:17:46.802 --> 01:17:48.793
Collateral damage.

01:17:51.606 --> 01:17:53.597
So, what do we do now?

01:17:54.943 --> 01:17:56.706
I'm not sorry.

01:18:56.371 --> 01:18:58.965
<i>No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he's here.</i>

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.974
No, that's nothing.

01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:03.442
<i>- Good synch-up.
- Who's this guy?</i>

01:19:03.511 --> 01:19:05.706
<i>Platform "B."</i>

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.874
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on.!
Do it.! Do it.!</i>

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:11.475
<i>She wouldn't want me to.</i>

01:19:11.553 --> 01:19:14.147
That's the only reason
you're alive.

01:19:25.133 --> 01:19:27.465
Got a call from Langley.

01:19:27.535 --> 01:19:30.470
<i>They're, uh, going through
Abbott's records,</i>

01:19:30.538 --> 01:19:33.701
<i>and Marshall wants to know
what's going on with Bourne.</i>

01:19:35.377 --> 01:19:39.040
<i>Wait, Teddy. Teddy, who's
this? Look at this guy.</i>

01:19:39.114 --> 01:19:41.207
<i>He's about to enter...
Right there.! There.!</i>

01:19:41.283 --> 01:19:43.547
<i>Right through there.
That's Bourne.</i>

01:19:43.618 --> 01:19:46.712
<i>- Get down here! We got something!
- We got a sighting.! Check it out.!</i>

01:19:46.788 --> 01:19:49.723
There. I got it on the big monitor.
Hold on.

01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:52.385
Here it comes again.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.190
<i>- Whoa, whoa. Hold on. He's just entered frame.
- It's the coat. That's him!</i>

01:19:55.263 --> 01:19:57.857
What train is that?

01:19:57.933 --> 01:20:01.494
- That's the train to Moscow.
- Why the hell would he go to Moscow?

01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:07.063
Get me
the Russian interior ministry.

01:23:33.548 --> 01:23:36.813
<i>Da.</i>

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:37.678
<i>Da.</i>

01:36:31.825 --> 01:36:34.555
I speak English.

01:36:34.628 --> 01:36:36.619
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:36:38.365 --> 01:36:40.356
I won't hurt you.

01:36:48.108 --> 01:36:50.099
You're older.

01:36:54.114 --> 01:36:56.105
Older than I thought you'd be.

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.154
That picture.

01:37:04.858 --> 01:37:07.622
<i>Does that mean a lot to you?</i>

01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:12.556
It's nothing.
It's just a picture.

01:37:12.633 --> 01:37:14.624
No.

01:37:15.869 --> 01:37:18.804
It's 'cause you don't know
how they died.

01:37:18.872 --> 01:37:20.863
I do.

01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:24.100
No, you don't.

01:37:29.616 --> 01:37:31.607
I would want to know.

01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:41.125
I would want to know that my...
that my mother didn't kill my father,

01:37:42.396 --> 01:37:44.330
that she didn't kill herself.

01:37:44.398 --> 01:37:46.389
What?

01:37:48.736 --> 01:37:52.331
It's not what happened
to your parents.

01:37:59.046 --> 01:38:01.037
I killed them.

01:38:04.418 --> 01:38:06.511
I killed them.

01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:10.750
It was my job.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.526
It was my first time.

01:38:19.933 --> 01:38:23.425
Your father
was supposed to be alone.

01:38:27.875 --> 01:38:29.866
But then your mother...

01:38:32.112 --> 01:38:34.103
<i>came out of nowhere,</i>

01:38:38.118 --> 01:38:40.609
<i>and I had to change my plan.</i>

01:38:46.393 --> 01:38:48.987
It changes things,

01:38:49.063 --> 01:38:50.997
that knowledge.

01:38:51.065 --> 01:38:53.056
Doesn't it?

01:38:58.405 --> 01:39:01.568
When what you love
gets taken from you,

01:39:05.612 --> 01:39:07.603
you wanna know the truth.

01:39:27.101 --> 01:39:29.092
I'm sorry.

01:40:27.194 --> 01:40:30.652
Pamela Landy.
I hear you're still looking for me.

01:40:35.102 --> 01:40:37.127
Bourne?
What do you want?

01:40:40.841 --> 01:40:43.776
I wanted to thank you...

01:40:43.844 --> 01:40:45.971
for the tape.

01:40:46.046 --> 01:40:50.506
<i>We got what we needed.
It's all tied off. It's over.</i>

01:40:51.818 --> 01:40:53.911
I guess I owe you an apology.

01:40:55.022 --> 01:40:57.217
Is that official?

01:40:57.291 --> 01:41:00.920
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

01:41:00.994 --> 01:41:02.859
Good-bye.

01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:05.524
Wait. Wait.

01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:11.670
David Webb.

01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:13.672
That's your real name.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:18.404
<i>You were born 4-15-71
in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

01:41:19.613 --> 01:41:22.605
<i>Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.</i>

01:41:26.153 --> 01:41:28.144
Bourne?

01:41:31.391 --> 01:41:34.383
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.

01:42:01.255 --> 01:42:03.086
<i>#Extreme ways are back again #</i>

01:42:03.156 --> 01:42:05.920
<i>#Extreme places I didn't know #</i>

01:42:05.993 --> 01:42:07.961
<i>#I broke everything new again #</i>

01:42:08.028 --> 01:42:10.326
<i>#Everything that I'd owned #</i>

01:42:10.397 --> 01:42:13.093
<i>#I threw it out the windows
Came along #</i>

01:42:13.166 --> 01:42:17.660
<i>#Extreme ways I know
will part the colors of my sea #</i>

01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:20.298
<i>#Perfect color me #</i>

01:42:20.374 --> 01:42:22.399
<i>#Extreme ways that help me #</i>

01:42:22.476 --> 01:42:25.036
<i># They help me out late at night #</i>

01:42:25.112 --> 01:42:27.103
<i>#Extreme places I had gone #</i>

01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.705
<i># That never see any light #</i>

01:42:29.783 --> 01:42:32.081
<i>#Dirty basements, dirty noise #</i>

01:42:32.152 --> 01:42:34.780
<i>#Dirty places comin'through #</i>

01:42:34.855 --> 01:42:36.720
<i>#Extreme worlds alone #</i>

01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:39.281
<i>#Did you ever like it planned #</i>

01:42:39.359 --> 01:42:42.760
<i>#I would stand in line for this #</i>

01:42:43.897 --> 01:42:47.856
<i># There's always room in life for this #</i>

01:42:48.969 --> 01:42:53.101
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:56.040
<i># Then it fell apart #</i>

01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:58.441
<i>#It fell apart #</i>

01:42:58.512 --> 01:43:02.710
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

01:43:02.783 --> 01:43:05.445
<i># Then it fell apart #</i>

01:43:05.519 --> 01:43:08.181
<i>#It fell apart #</i>

01:43:08.255 --> 01:43:12.219
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

01:43:12.292 --> 01:43:14.988
<i># Then it fell apart #</i>

01:43:15.062 --> 01:43:17.656
<i>#It fell apart #</i>

01:43:17.731 --> 01:43:21.897
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

01:43:21.968 --> 01:43:24.903
<i>#Like it always does #</i>

01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:27.599
<i>#Always does #</i>

01:43:27.674 --> 01:43:29.539
<i>#Extreme sounds that told me #</i>

01:43:29.609 --> 01:43:31.941
<i># They held me down every night #</i>

01:43:32.012 --> 01:43:34.310
<i>#I didn't have much to say #</i>

01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:36.679
<i>#I didn't give up the light #</i>

01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:39.048
<i>#I closed my eyes and closed myself #</i>

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:40.313
<i>#And closed my world #</i>

01:43:40.387 --> 01:43:43.754
<i>#And never opened up to anything #</i>

01:43:43.824 --> 01:43:45.655
<i># That could get me at all #</i>

01:43:46.793 --> 01:43:48.761
<i>#I had to close down everything #</i>

01:43:48.829 --> 01:43:51.229
<i>#I had to close down my mind #</i>

01:43:51.298 --> 01:43:53.664
<i># Too many things to cover me #</i>

01:43:53.734 --> 01:43:55.998
<i># Too much can make me blind #</i>

01:43:56.069 --> 01:43:58.401
<i>#I've seen so much in so many places #</i>

01:43:58.472 --> 01:44:00.736
<i>#So many heartaches, so many faces #</i>

01:44:00.807 --> 01:44:03.105
<i>#So many dirty things #</i>

01:44:03.176 --> 01:44:05.667
<i># You couldn't even believe #</i>

01:44:05.746 --> 01:44:09.238
<i>#I would stand in line for this #</i>

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:13.913
<i>#It's always good in life for this #</i>

01:44:15.422 --> 01:44:19.554
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

01:44:19.626 --> 01:44:22.288
