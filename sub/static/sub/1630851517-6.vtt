YOUNG SHELDON #506
"Money Laundering
and a Cascade of Hormones" Closed Captioned

00:01.500 --> 00:03.830
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:05.602 --> 00:06.682
What's going on?

00:06.682 --> 00:08.062
Are you Connie Tucker?

00:08.062 --> 00:10.062
A secret casino room?

00:10.062 --> 00:12.112
The cops shut me down.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.732
Well, let's get this
going again.
I'm listening.

00:14.732 --> 00:16.532
I was thinking
about Chuck E. Cheese.

00:16.532 --> 00:19.572
Grown-up people don't-don't
gamble to win a teddy bear.

00:19.572 --> 00:20.862
I'm trying to help you.

00:20.862 --> 00:23.492
You think that grown-ups

00:23.492 --> 00:25.742
are gonna gamble
for some stuffed animals?

00:25.742 --> 00:27.622
Yeah, that you're
buying back from them.

00:27.622 --> 00:30.252
It seems I owe you an apology.

00:30.252 --> 00:32.542
Come on in.

00:34.882 --> 00:36.752
When children reach adolescence,

00:36.752 --> 00:39.222
a cascade of hormones
are released,

00:39.222 --> 00:42.222
causing mood swings,
impulsive behavior

00:42.222 --> 00:43.932
and an unbelievable amount
of eye rolling.

00:45.554 --> 00:48.102
During this time of change,
members of the opposite sex

00:48.102 --> 00:50.432
who caught my sister's fancy

00:50.432 --> 00:51.642
New Kids on the Block,

00:51.642 --> 00:53.902
Rufio from the movie Hook,

00:53.902 --> 00:55.902
and, oddly enough,

00:55.902 --> 00:58.442
our new Sunday school teacher,
Pastor Rob.

00:58.442 --> 01:01.072
Was Mary Magdalene
Jesus' girlfriend?

01:01.072 --> 01:03.702
No, just one of his followers.

01:03.702 --> 01:05.412
Yeah, Jesus didn't have
a girlfriend.

01:05.412 --> 01:08.332
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:08.332 --> 01:10.162
No. No, I don't.

01:10.162 --> 01:12.422
I don't have
a girlfriend either.

01:12.422 --> 01:14.252
All right.

01:14.252 --> 01:16.752
You and me, Billy,
couple of bachelors.

01:16.752 --> 01:18.922
Are you allowed
to have a girlfriend?

01:18.922 --> 01:20.632
In the Baptist church, yes.

01:20.632 --> 01:21.922
Pastor Jeff is married.

01:21.922 --> 01:23.552
And was married
before,

01:23.552 --> 01:25.092
so he's had two wives,
but not at the same time,

01:25.092 --> 01:26.102
that's not allowed.

01:26.102 --> 01:27.142
Thank you, Sheldon.

01:27.142 --> 01:28.472
At least not anymore.

01:28.472 --> 01:30.062
In the Old Testament,
Abraham had two,

01:30.062 --> 01:32.442
Jacob had four,
and Solomon had 1,000,

01:32.442 --> 01:34.522
but those were largely
for political alliances.

01:34.522 --> 01:36.902
only 700
of those were wives.

01:36.902 --> 01:38.732
The other 300
were concubines.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.112
I wouldn't count on the Bible
for facts, but that was fun.

01:42.112 --> 01:44.492
So boyfriends and girlfriends
are okay?

01:47.832 --> 01:50.372
The way I see it, God is love,

01:50.372 --> 01:52.542
so if we love someone else

01:52.542 --> 01:55.962
in a committed relationship,

01:55.962 --> 01:57.962
we're feeling God.

01:57.962 --> 01:59.342
So, holding hands is okay?

01:59.342 --> 02:02.172
Sure.
What about kissing?

02:02.172 --> 02:04.302
Maybe at some point,
when you're older.

02:04.302 --> 02:06.302
And what exactly is third base?

02:06.302 --> 02:07.932
I'm thinking
it might be a good idea

02:07.932 --> 02:11.142
if we gave the kids a talk
about the facts of life.

02:11.142 --> 02:13.682
You mean like, S-E-X?

02:13.682 --> 02:15.232
Who are you spelling
that for?

02:15.232 --> 02:16.982
G-O-D.

02:16.982 --> 02:19.022
You really think
that's an appropriate topic

02:19.022 --> 02:20.732
for kids their age?

02:20.732 --> 02:22.362
Well, they seem to have
a lot of questions about...

02:23.362 --> 02:24.862
S-E-X.

02:24.862 --> 02:27.702
Sex, sex, sex.
Get over it.

02:27.702 --> 02:30.162
I just think that's a subject

02:30.162 --> 02:31.662
best left up to the parents.

02:31.662 --> 02:33.372
Glad you feel that way,

02:33.372 --> 02:34.832
because it was your daughter
who had the most questions.

02:37.832 --> 02:41.002
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:41.002 --> 02:43.382
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

02:43.382 --> 02:46.842
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

02:46.842 --> 02:48.932
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

02:48.932 --> 02:52.642
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:56.942 --> 02:58.852
Even if...

02:58.852 --> 03:00.692
Missy had one
or two questions...

03:00.692 --> 03:01.862
It was a lot of questions.

03:01.862 --> 03:02.902
Doesn't matter
how many questions.

03:02.902 --> 03:04.612
We can answer them at home.

03:04.612 --> 03:06.112
I'm sure
you can.

03:06.112 --> 03:08.572
I just think this is
our chance to get in first

03:08.572 --> 03:10.202
before they
learn it on TV.

03:10.202 --> 03:11.452
That is true.

03:11.452 --> 03:12.992
I flipped past MTV
the other night,

03:12.992 --> 03:15.372
and a song was on called...

03:15.372 --> 03:17.292
"I Wanna Sex You Up."

03:17.292 --> 03:18.462
What does that even mean?

03:18.462 --> 03:19.672
I turned it off

03:19.672 --> 03:21.292
before the young man
could clarify.

03:21.292 --> 03:22.802
Well, if you ask me, I think
it means he wants to...

03:22.802 --> 03:24.882
No one asked you.

03:24.882 --> 03:27.552
See? Even we have questions.
Why wouldn't the kids?

03:27.552 --> 03:29.552
I think they deserve
honest answers.

03:29.552 --> 03:31.432
You seem to know a lot
about children

03:31.432 --> 03:34.222
for someone who has
none of their own.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.312
So what's my

03:38.312 --> 03:39.482
title here?

03:39.482 --> 03:41.402
Manager? Supervisor?

03:41.402 --> 03:44.282
Your title is "grandson
who can go home now."

03:44.282 --> 03:46.442
What are you talking about?
We're in this together.

03:46.442 --> 03:48.952
I'm sorry, did you buy
these machines?

03:48.952 --> 03:51.822
No, but it was my idea how to
get them up and running again.

03:51.822 --> 03:54.242
And thank you. Now, go home
before I tell your mother

03:54.242 --> 03:56.252
you want to work
in a secret casino.

03:56.252 --> 03:58.002
Oh, yeah?

03:58.002 --> 04:00.582
Maybe I should tell her
you own a secret casino.

04:00.582 --> 04:01.922
Is that the way
you want to play this?

04:01.922 --> 04:03.462
Yeah, it is.

04:05.092 --> 04:06.262
Missy

04:06.262 --> 04:08.262
was asking about sex.

04:08.262 --> 04:09.342
What?

04:09.342 --> 04:11.262
You don't think that she's...

04:11.262 --> 04:12.722
No.

04:12.722 --> 04:15.432
But she's clearly
interested in the topic.

04:15.432 --> 04:17.852
That's it-- she's grounded
till she's 21.
George.

04:17.852 --> 04:20.602
Well, maybe it's good this
pastor wants to talk about it.

04:20.602 --> 04:21.772
I sure as hell don't.

04:21.772 --> 04:23.692
You're unbelievable.

04:23.692 --> 04:26.322
I had to do it with Georgie,
and it was a disaster.

04:26.322 --> 04:29.112
Well, here is a chance
to do it right.

04:29.112 --> 04:31.862
I have two words
not it.

04:33.122 --> 04:34.332
Fine.

04:34.332 --> 04:37.452
You can be my assistant manager.

04:37.452 --> 04:39.622
Oh, I like the
sound of that.

04:39.622 --> 04:41.082
So, it's a deal?

04:41.082 --> 04:42.792
Well, hold on,
how much you gonna pay me?

04:42.792 --> 04:44.632
Did I mention
that assistant manager

04:44.632 --> 04:46.552
comes with a spiffy nametag?

04:46.552 --> 04:49.012
Does it also come
with a spiffy paycheck?

04:50.632 --> 04:52.182
How much did Dale pay you?

04:52.182 --> 04:55.012
Uh, minimum wage plus
five percent commission.

04:55.012 --> 04:56.682
I'll give you half of that.

04:56.682 --> 04:58.022
So, two and a half
percent commission?

04:58.022 --> 05:00.182
No, half of
the minimum wage part.

05:01.312 --> 05:02.562
What about a
percentage of these?

05:02.562 --> 05:03.902
Yeah, right.

05:03.902 --> 05:05.522
I'm serious.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.152
If it wasn't for me,
none of this would be happening.

05:07.152 --> 05:08.652
I'm your grandmother.
If it weren't for me,

05:08.652 --> 05:10.192
you wouldn't be happening.

05:10.192 --> 05:13.572
no hourly wage, just a cut.

05:13.572 --> 05:15.322
What kind of cut you thinking?

05:15.322 --> 05:17.082
Five percent.
Three percent.

05:17.082 --> 05:18.662
Five.
Three.

05:18.662 --> 05:20.162
You're supposed to go in
the middle and say four.

05:20.162 --> 05:21.502
Why don't you say four?

05:21.502 --> 05:23.502
Fine, four.

05:23.502 --> 05:25.332
Two.
Come on.

05:25.332 --> 05:27.042
I'll tell you what,

05:27.042 --> 05:29.422
we're in the gambling business,
why don't we gamble for it?

05:29.422 --> 05:30.592
Okay.

05:30.592 --> 05:32.172
Great.
The number

05:32.172 --> 05:34.262
I'm thinking of in my head--
is it odd or even?

05:34.262 --> 05:36.222
How dumb do you think I am?

05:36.222 --> 05:39.062
In my defense,
you used to be dumber.

05:39.062 --> 05:41.022
Why don't you two
have a seat.

05:41.022 --> 05:42.182
In here?

05:42.182 --> 05:43.602
Did somebody die?

05:43.602 --> 05:45.522
No, I just want to talk to you.

05:45.522 --> 05:47.152
They're getting divorced.

05:47.152 --> 05:48.772
At least they waited until
one of us was in college.

05:48.772 --> 05:52.782
We are not getting a divorce.
Just sit.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.242
So, you two

05:58.242 --> 06:00.202
are both growing up,
and I thought

06:00.202 --> 06:01.752
that maybe it might be time

06:01.752 --> 06:04.082
to have a talk about...

06:04.082 --> 06:06.332
that and some of the things

06:06.332 --> 06:08.882
that go along with... that.

06:08.882 --> 06:10.882
What is happening?
I think she's trying to have

06:10.882 --> 06:12.212
the human reproduction talk.

06:12.212 --> 06:14.432
Oh, God.
Uh, speaking of God,

06:14.432 --> 06:16.892
He is very clear about
the do's and the don'ts,

06:16.892 --> 06:18.642
especially the don'ts.

06:18.642 --> 06:20.812
I'm not talking
about this with you.

06:20.812 --> 06:22.392
I don't think you'll have
any new information for me,

06:22.392 --> 06:24.562
but I'm happy to chime in
with biology facts.

06:24.562 --> 06:27.402
I don't have any questions.
I'm good. Can we be done now?

06:27.402 --> 06:30.112
So, you'll ask Pastor Rob,
but you won't ask me?

06:30.112 --> 06:32.112
I didn't ask you
'cause I know what you'll say.

06:32.112 --> 06:33.822
You don't know
what I'm gonna say.

06:33.822 --> 06:35.572
"It's a sin."
"You're too young."

06:35.572 --> 06:36.742
"Wait till marriage."

06:36.742 --> 06:37.872
Well, it is, you are,

06:37.872 --> 06:39.372
and you should.

06:39.372 --> 06:40.742
You can't be too young
if you're an aphid,

06:40.742 --> 06:42.542
some of them are born pregnant.

06:42.542 --> 06:44.962
I didn't do anything wrong.
I just asked some questions.

06:44.962 --> 06:46.672
Well, you can ask me.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.712
I'm not asking you
anything, ever.

06:53.922 --> 06:55.972
It's just her hormones.

06:55.972 --> 06:57.342
Would you like to learn more?

06:58.932 --> 07:00.512
When children
reach adolescence,

07:00.512 --> 07:02.315
a cascade of hormones
are released...

07:15.181 --> 07:16.681
What are you doing?

07:16.681 --> 07:18.681
Making sure you
don't run away.

07:18.681 --> 07:20.561
Why?
Because that's what happened

07:20.561 --> 07:22.441
the last time
you and Mom fought.

07:22.441 --> 07:25.191
I'm not going anywhere.

07:25.191 --> 07:26.901
Now, get out of here, creepo.

07:26.901 --> 07:28.401
Why did you get
so mad at Mom?

07:28.401 --> 07:29.731
I don't want to talk to her
about that stuff.

07:29.731 --> 07:31.531
It's so embarrassing.
Why?

07:31.531 --> 07:33.361
If you have to ask,
then something's wrong with you.

07:33.361 --> 07:36.411
But the topic was procreation,
and she clearly has procreated.

07:36.411 --> 07:37.701
Ew.

07:39.951 --> 07:42.211
Hey. You got
a minute?

07:42.211 --> 07:43.871
Sure. Come on in.

07:43.871 --> 07:46.211
I just wanted to say,

07:46.211 --> 07:48.591
about yesterday, you were right.

07:48.591 --> 07:50.511
Oh.
I don't have kids,

07:50.511 --> 07:52.631
I overstepped my bounds,
and I'm sorry.

07:52.631 --> 07:55.301
Thank you for saying that.

07:55.301 --> 07:57.051
Forgiveness five?

07:57.051 --> 07:58.971
Sure.

07:58.971 --> 08:00.391
Oh, come on now,

08:00.391 --> 08:01.771
that didn't feel like
you forgave me.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.981
All right.
I'm feeling it.

08:05.771 --> 08:07.401
Okay, well, I'll let you
get back to it.

08:07.401 --> 08:09.771
Actually, um...

08:09.771 --> 08:12.151
I might have
overstepped yesterday.

08:12.151 --> 08:14.491
In fact, I...

08:14.491 --> 08:16.781
think there might be some value
in the kids hearing

08:16.781 --> 08:20.081
some of these things from people
other than their parents.

08:20.081 --> 08:22.331
Great.

08:22.331 --> 08:24.581
Hey, maybe it's something
you and I could do together?

08:24.581 --> 08:27.081
Oh, no, no, no,
this was your idea.

08:27.081 --> 08:29.291
Yeah, but you've got
way more experience.

08:30.171 --> 08:31.461
With kids, I mean.

08:31.461 --> 08:33.131
I know what you meant.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.591
Plus, it would be great for
them to hear from a woman.

08:37.591 --> 08:39.851
So, either you or Peg, so...

08:39.851 --> 08:43.351
Oh. I want to scare them,
but not that much.

08:43.351 --> 08:45.101
So, you'll do it?

08:45.101 --> 08:46.981
Okay.

08:46.981 --> 08:49.771
I'll tell Pastor Jeff. I like
watching his face get all red

08:49.771 --> 08:51.441
when I mention S-E-X.

08:52.611 --> 08:54.111
Hey, yours does, too.

08:56.611 --> 08:58.111
So, you're gonna

08:58.111 --> 08:59.741
give us your ticket,

08:59.741 --> 09:01.791
and we're gonna give you
the teddy bear.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.621
Why would I want a teddy bear?

09:03.621 --> 09:05.661
'Cause then we're gonna buy
the teddy bear back.

09:05.661 --> 09:08.291
But I said I don't
want a teddy bear.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.381
I want cash.

09:09.381 --> 09:11.001
You're gonna get the cash.

09:11.001 --> 09:12.961
Then why do you keep talking
about a teddy bear?

09:12.961 --> 09:14.461
'Cause this way
it ain't gambling.

09:14.461 --> 09:15.971
But I want to gamble.

09:15.971 --> 09:19.341
Well, gambling's illegal.
This is a gray area.

09:20.551 --> 09:22.681
Just give him the cash.

09:22.681 --> 09:24.141
No, he's gonna get this.

09:24.141 --> 09:25.561
I don't think he is.

09:25.561 --> 09:27.811
Listen to your Meemaw.
I don't get it.

09:27.811 --> 09:29.021
Just give me your ticket.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.151
Wow.
That is a nice teddy bear.

09:34.151 --> 09:36.031
I'd like to buy that from you.

09:43.241 --> 09:45.501
I don't think he got it.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.331
And then Missy

09:47.331 --> 09:49.121
said it was embarrassing
to talk to our mother

09:49.121 --> 09:50.251
about reproduction.

09:50.251 --> 09:52.711
Interesting, yet the two of you

09:52.711 --> 09:54.591
are living proof
she has at least

09:54.591 --> 09:56.671
a working knowledge
of the subject.

09:56.671 --> 09:59.431
That's what I said, then Missy
said something's wrong with me.

09:59.431 --> 10:02.551
Oh, I think
you're as normal as I am.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.011
Thank you.

10:04.011 --> 10:07.601
Although, I have been called
an odd duck

10:07.601 --> 10:09.771
and, one time, a quirky turkey.

10:09.771 --> 10:12.191
Those people
were probably jealous.

10:12.191 --> 10:15.441
You know, there's
some science to indicate

10:15.441 --> 10:16.861
that adolescents

10:16.861 --> 10:18.571
process embarrassment

10:18.571 --> 10:21.781
with a different part
of their brain than adults do.

10:21.781 --> 10:25.201
Really? So maybe Missy's right,
and I'm an outlier.

10:25.201 --> 10:26.871
Perhaps.

10:26.871 --> 10:30.041
Let's increase our sample size.

10:30.041 --> 10:33.381
Andy, would you
feel embarrassed

10:33.381 --> 10:35.461
talking about
sexual intercourse

10:35.461 --> 10:36.961
with your mother?

10:36.961 --> 10:38.211
Uh...

10:38.211 --> 10:40.131
Stammering, red-faced.

10:40.131 --> 10:41.431
He does seem embarrassed.

10:41.431 --> 10:43.351
Although,
he may just be embarrassed

10:43.351 --> 10:44.971
by the subject in general.

10:44.971 --> 10:47.221
How would you feel

10:47.221 --> 10:49.931
discussing it with a co-worker?

10:49.931 --> 10:52.101
Say-say me, for example.

10:54.231 --> 10:57.401
And now we know
conversations like that

10:57.401 --> 10:58.901
can cost you your job.

10:58.901 --> 11:01.401
You learn something new
every day.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.621
I think
First Corinthians 7:2

11:04.621 --> 11:07.291
is actually a pretty good
place to start.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.751
"Each man should have relations
with his own wife,

11:09.751 --> 11:11.501
and each woman
with her own husband."

11:11.501 --> 11:15.211
Yeah, I'm just not sure
quoting scripture

11:15.211 --> 11:18.251
is the most exciting way
to engage.

11:18.251 --> 11:19.971
I was going more
for guilt and fear.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.431
Well, those are classics
for a reason.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.351
I just think that if we make
the fruit too forbidden,

11:25.351 --> 11:27.431
someone might want
to sneak a bite.

11:27.431 --> 11:29.311
They look up to you.

11:29.311 --> 11:32.271
If you say that abstinence
is the way to go,

11:32.271 --> 11:33.481
they'll listen.

11:33.481 --> 11:36.111
Well, abstinence is important.

11:36.111 --> 11:38.321
But I also believe in honesty,

11:38.321 --> 11:40.691
and abstinence
wasn't my journey.

11:40.691 --> 11:42.651
Oh.

11:44.611 --> 11:46.621
Well, that's none
of my business.

11:46.621 --> 11:49.331
That's okay. I'm not saying I'm
proud of everything I've done,

11:49.331 --> 11:51.961
but, you know, I was young, the
mustache was just coming in...

11:51.961 --> 11:53.421
You could stop right there.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.631
Look, all I'm saying is,
I was a little wild,

11:55.631 --> 11:57.341
but it's all part
of what led me to the Lord.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.501
That is good to hear.

12:00.631 --> 12:02.171
Actually, this is great.

12:02.171 --> 12:03.881
You can tell the kids
how you waited till marriage.

12:03.881 --> 12:06.801
I think it'll be really powerful
for them to hear your story.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.391
Uh-huh, right, right.

12:12.391 --> 12:13.641
Right.

12:13.641 --> 12:16.191
Something seems not right.

12:16.191 --> 12:19.521
Um, it's just, um...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.821
I didn't wait

12:23.821 --> 12:26.571
all the way until marriage.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.411
Hey, none of my business.

12:28.411 --> 12:29.871
Thank you.

12:29.871 --> 12:31.751
But I appreciate the honesty.

12:37.081 --> 12:38.211
Well, this just got
a little awkward.

12:38.211 --> 12:40.051
Yup. Yeah.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.381
All right, have a good one.

12:41.381 --> 12:43.841

13:16.711 --> 13:17.711
Oh, what's that?

13:17.711 --> 13:19.711
I can't get it to close.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.541
That is my kind of problem.

13:26.171 --> 13:28.721
Pastor Rob.
Well, this is a surprise.

13:28.721 --> 13:31.391
Sorry to show up unannounced.
Can we talk?

13:31.391 --> 13:33.471
Of course. Come in.

13:35.061 --> 13:36.521
Everything okay?

13:36.521 --> 13:39.981
Yes, but I need tell you
something in confidence.

13:39.981 --> 13:43.401
No one's home.
It's just the two of us.

13:43.401 --> 13:44.901
That's what I was hoping.

13:44.901 --> 13:46.241
Oh, yeah.

13:46.241 --> 13:48.821
Why are you in my bed?
Why are you?

13:51.071 --> 13:53.081
This is wrong.

13:53.081 --> 13:55.451
Does it feel wrong?

13:56.581 --> 13:57.621
No.

13:57.621 --> 14:00.291
Mary Cooper,

14:00.291 --> 14:02.091
I want to sex you up.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.881
I would like that very much.

♪ I wanna sex you up. ♪

14:09.591 --> 14:13.181

14:14.681 --> 14:16.931
Must've been a doozy.

14:16.931 --> 14:19.311
You're all sweaty.

14:21.441 --> 14:23.191
♪ I wanna sex you up. ♪

14:32.497 --> 14:33.997
What a haul, huh?!

14:33.997 --> 14:35.537
Amazing.

14:36.478 --> 14:37.848
Now what happens?

14:37.848 --> 14:40.358
I take it home,
pour it on the bed,

14:40.358 --> 14:42.108
and just roll around in it.

14:42.108 --> 14:43.398
What about me?

14:43.398 --> 14:45.188
You just go home.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.358
No. We're partners.

14:47.358 --> 14:50.068
First of all, we're
not partners, and second...

14:51.068 --> 14:53.408
Actually, "not partners"
covers it all pretty well.

14:53.408 --> 14:56.908
Fine. Good luck laundering
this money without me.

14:56.908 --> 14:59.458
You know how to do that?

14:59.458 --> 15:01.288
I've seen Scarface,
like, ten times.

15:01.288 --> 15:03.748
Great. I'll just watch Scarface.

15:03.748 --> 15:05.508
Dang it.

15:06.878 --> 15:10.548
Pastor Jeff, you wanted
to see me... Oh. Hello.

15:10.548 --> 15:13.258
Looks like we both got called
to the principal's office.

15:13.258 --> 15:15.308
Guess we've
been naughty.

15:17.228 --> 15:18.768
That's not a thing.

15:18.768 --> 15:20.098
You okay?

15:20.098 --> 15:22.478
Yeah, I just
didn't sleep too good.

15:22.478 --> 15:25.278
Well, I didn't either. My phone
was ringing off the hook.

15:25.278 --> 15:27.108
Apparently, this little talk

15:27.108 --> 15:29.898
y'all were planning on giving
is causing quite the tizzy.

15:29.898 --> 15:32.658
A good tizzy?
There's no such thing
as a good tizzy.

15:32.658 --> 15:34.238
There's only bad tizzies.

15:34.238 --> 15:35.988
You know who wasn't afraid
of causing a tizzy?

15:35.988 --> 15:37.618
Yeah, yeah, Jesus,

15:37.618 --> 15:40.038
but He didn't get 14 messages
from angry parents

15:40.038 --> 15:41.708
on his answering machine.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.748
There was probably more,
but that little tape got full.

15:43.748 --> 15:46.668
Yeah, people have had
some strong feelings,

15:46.668 --> 15:48.878
but I think if they
heard us out, they'd see

15:48.878 --> 15:50.928
we're not putting impure
thoughts in anyone's heads.

15:50.928 --> 15:52.138
Right, Mary?

15:52.138 --> 15:54.968
No. I mean, I mean,
yes, we're not.

15:54.968 --> 15:56.178
I mean,

15:56.178 --> 15:57.768
if we're upsetting people,

15:57.768 --> 15:59.098
we should just back off.

15:59.098 --> 16:01.098
Exactly. The talk is off.

16:01.098 --> 16:03.098
I never want to talk
about the talk again.

16:03.098 --> 16:04.188
Hallelujah.

16:04.188 --> 16:05.728
If you'll excuse me,

16:05.728 --> 16:07.478
I have 14 phone calls to return.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.988
Well, sorry this
didn't work out.

16:09.988 --> 16:12.608
It's probably for the best.

16:14.278 --> 16:15.828
Do not look at his butt.

16:15.828 --> 16:17.198
Do not look.

16:17.198 --> 16:19.498
Okay, do not look again.

16:19.498 --> 16:22.038
...the weather didn't finish
him off, you can bet that

16:22.038 --> 16:23.458
the polar bears did.

16:23.458 --> 16:24.788
Not necessarily.

16:24.788 --> 16:26.338
Everything okay?
No.

16:26.338 --> 16:28.208
What's wrong?
Everyone's parents are upset

16:28.208 --> 16:29.758
about the sex talk
Mom wants to give,

16:29.758 --> 16:31.128
and all my friends
are all blaming me.

16:31.128 --> 16:33.178
What? This wasn't your fault.

16:33.178 --> 16:34.888
That didn't stop
Marjorie Jones from taking

16:34.888 --> 16:36.008
my seat at the
lunch table,

16:36.008 --> 16:37.138
and I also
got uninvited

16:37.138 --> 16:38.848
from two birthday parties.

16:38.848 --> 16:41.478
That's silly.
All you did was ask questions.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.058
And it's ruining my life.

16:43.058 --> 16:45.018
I'm never talking
about sex ever again.

16:46.808 --> 16:48.228
Well, all right.

16:52.898 --> 16:54.448
Hey, there, Connie.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.948
What do you want?

16:55.948 --> 16:58.278
Is that any way to greet
an officer of the law?

16:58.278 --> 16:59.988
Sorry.

16:59.988 --> 17:01.288
What do you want?

17:01.288 --> 17:02.908
I hear you're
back in business.

17:02.908 --> 17:05.708
We're not breaking any laws.

17:05.708 --> 17:09.378
People are just
winning these prizes.

17:09.378 --> 17:10.548
That you buy back
for cash.

17:10.548 --> 17:13.008
It's a gray area.

17:13.008 --> 17:14.878
Look, I-I'm not here to argue.

17:14.878 --> 17:18.678
At the risk of repeating myself,

17:18.678 --> 17:20.348
what do you want?

17:20.348 --> 17:23.638
I've heard that in
cash businesses

17:23.638 --> 17:25.348
such as this,

17:25.348 --> 17:27.308
that some owners
can benefit

17:27.308 --> 17:29.858
by having a strong
relationship with their local

17:29.858 --> 17:31.938
police department.
What are you getting at?

17:31.938 --> 17:33.898
I'm just wondering

17:33.898 --> 17:37.368
if there's something you can do
to incur good will.

17:37.368 --> 17:39.198
Are you shaking me down?
No.

17:39.198 --> 17:40.618
Are you hitting on me?

17:40.618 --> 17:42.288
No. Uh...

17:42.288 --> 17:44.208
I'm just saying

17:44.208 --> 17:46.538
I've heard some business owners

17:46.538 --> 17:48.748
like to invest
in local law enforcement.

17:48.748 --> 17:50.208
You are shaking me down.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.128
It's a gray area.

17:54.008 --> 17:56.548
What kind of contribution
are we talking?

17:56.548 --> 17:58.638
well, that's up to you.

17:58.638 --> 18:00.718
Oh, I understand
that somewhere

18:00.718 --> 18:03.468
between nine
and 11% is popular.

18:03.468 --> 18:04.888
Ten percent?

18:04.888 --> 18:06.438
If you insist.

18:06.438 --> 18:07.978
How about three?

18:07.978 --> 18:09.558
Three what?

18:09.558 --> 18:12.528
Three counts
of illegal gambling?

18:12.528 --> 18:14.068
Three years in jail?

18:14.068 --> 18:16.738
I'm paying you in quarters.

18:21.278 --> 18:24.948
Missy, I know you're upset.
Would you like a hot beverage?

18:24.948 --> 18:26.618
Go away.

18:26.618 --> 18:29.458
Every culture has their taboos.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.458
In the Ukraine,
it's rude to whistle indoors,

18:32.458 --> 18:33.838
and they're correct. Not a fan.

18:33.838 --> 18:35.508
In our society,

18:35.508 --> 18:38.258
any discussion
of human reproduction

18:38.258 --> 18:39.428
seems to be so upsetting,

18:39.428 --> 18:41.548
it causes nothing but chaos.

18:43.178 --> 18:45.218
Lost jobs.

18:46.348 --> 18:49.768
Lost friends.

18:50.938 --> 18:53.438
Sleepless nights.

18:53.438 --> 18:56.438
Even the word "sex" provokes
an uncomfortable reaction.

18:56.438 --> 18:58.528
I thought "fornicate"
might work,

18:58.528 --> 19:01.658
but that seemed too judgy.

19:01.658 --> 19:03.658
Then I found the perfect word,

19:03.658 --> 19:06.328
a word so bland and clinical

19:06.328 --> 19:09.038
that it would be impossible
to take offense to it.

19:09.038 --> 19:11.538
"Coitus." That'll work.

19:20.332 --> 19:22.792
My little angel.

19:27.922 --> 19:31.092
Do you, Pastor Rob, take
Melissa Cooper to be your wife?

19:31.092 --> 19:32.262
Heck yeah.

19:32.262 --> 19:34.262
And do you, Melissa Cooper,

19:34.262 --> 19:36.012
take Pastor Rob
to be your husband?

19:36.012 --> 19:37.842
I totally do.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.722
I hereby pronounce you

19:39.722 --> 19:42.352
Mr. and Mrs. Youth Pastor Rob.

19:42.352 --> 19:44.602
You may now take
the bride to Six Flags.

19:44.602 --> 19:46.312
Yay!
Yay!
