01:02.870 --> 01:06.791
I loved the smell of the mountain
juniberries in the early morning breeze.

01:06.874 --> 01:09.085
<i>As did I, Allura.</i>

01:09.168 --> 01:11.337
Remember the summer berry festival?

01:11.420 --> 01:15.299
People would come from all over Altea
for the harvest.

01:15.383 --> 01:18.594
<i>I remember how the berry juice
stained your favorite dress.</i>

01:18.677 --> 01:19.970
<i>You were so upset.</i>

01:21.972 --> 01:24.391
It took forever for Mother to calm me.

01:25.893 --> 01:29.563
I miss Altea so much.
I miss you, Father.

01:29.647 --> 01:33.275
<i>- I wish it didn't have to be this way.
- I know, Allura,</i>

01:33.359 --> 01:37.029
<i>but, as leaders, we have to do
what's right for our people,</i>

01:37.113 --> 01:40.407
<i>even if it means great sacrifice.</i>

01:40.491 --> 01:43.744
I know, Father.
That's what you always say.

01:44.411 --> 01:47.081
Princess, there you are.
What are you doing up and about?

01:47.164 --> 01:48.290
You should be resting.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.793
Oh, Coran, can't I stay?

01:50.876 --> 01:53.879
The Balmera rejuvenation ceremony
took a lot out of you.

01:53.963 --> 01:55.381
Come along, to your room.

01:55.464 --> 01:59.802
<i>Get your rest, darling.
I will be here for you when you're well.</i>

01:59.885 --> 02:03.180
I love you, Father. I'll see you soon.

02:13.023 --> 02:15.901
<i>Pidge, please come down
to the detainment room.</i>

02:31.917 --> 02:34.420
Okay, guys,
Sendak's almost all hooked up.

02:34.503 --> 02:36.213
But, look, I have to warn you,

02:36.297 --> 02:38.924
this technology was used
to keep Altean memories alive,

02:39.008 --> 02:40.885
not to interrogate prisoners.

02:40.968 --> 02:44.346
Coran, we understand this isn't
what the technology was meant for,

02:44.430 --> 02:46.557
but if we can extract Sendak's memories,

02:46.640 --> 02:49.685
we may gain valuable intelligence
on Zarkon's troop locations.

02:49.768 --> 02:52.771
Yeah, and then we can just be like,
"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

02:52.855 --> 02:55.065
"The avenging fury of Voltron, son!"

02:55.149 --> 02:58.652
Fascinating.
So, how exactly does this work?

02:58.736 --> 03:00.237
As the memories are extracted,

03:00.321 --> 03:04.450
they're written bit by bit on individual
molecules of the micro-storage strands.

03:04.533 --> 03:08.412
When I go, I want all the stuff
in my brain stored in a giant ship.

03:08.495 --> 03:12.124
The amount of information in your brain
could be stored in a paper airplane.

03:12.208 --> 03:15.544
Oh, yeah? Well, the amount of information
you have, Keith, could be...

03:15.628 --> 03:16.837
Yeah?

03:17.379 --> 03:21.258
- Uh... it's less than what I have!
- Oh, good one, Lance!

03:21.342 --> 03:25.304
This is how you incorporated King Alfor's
memories into the Castle of Lions?

03:25.387 --> 03:29.308
Precisely, but it's never been attempted
before on an unwilling participant.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.776
Uh, is this what's supposed
to be happening?

03:38.859 --> 03:40.861
Let's give it some time.

03:57.586 --> 04:02.550
Well, I can't wait around anymore.
I'm going to hit the training deck.

04:04.552 --> 04:07.096
Okay, if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the lab.

04:07.179 --> 04:10.057
Maybe I can pull some information
from Sendak's Galra crystal.

04:12.768 --> 04:15.980
Time to feed the beast.
I'm going to go make some breakfast.

04:16.063 --> 04:18.482
Well, I'm afraid I can't wait here
any longer, either.

04:18.565 --> 04:21.442
I have a million duties to attend to.
Between that Galra crystal

04:21.527 --> 04:23.946
infecting our system,
and then fighting off those ships

04:24.029 --> 04:26.323
and performing the Balmeran
rejuvenation ceremony,

04:26.407 --> 04:29.410
the old Castle of Lions
has taken quite a beating.

04:29.493 --> 04:32.288
Every system needs to be
recharged and repaired.

04:33.122 --> 04:37.835
I'll stay. Somewhere in Sendak's mind is
the information about Zarkon that we need.

04:37.918 --> 04:41.672
Okay, well, while you guys do that,
I think I'm gonna get my chill on.

04:41.755 --> 04:44.758
Maybe kick back with a lemonade
or space juice. Something.

04:44.842 --> 04:47.761
Hold on there, space juice.
You're going to come and help me.

04:47.845 --> 04:49.179
What? Why? Why me?

04:49.263 --> 04:50.764
Because you're the last one here

04:50.848 --> 04:52.641
and because your activity
isn't very important.

04:52.808 --> 04:54.977
Wait, did I say
"chill with a good lemonade"?

04:55.060 --> 04:58.063
- I meant I gotta do homework.
- No. Too late.

04:58.147 --> 04:59.690
Fine.

04:59.773 --> 05:02.359
Let us know if anything happens.

05:02.443 --> 05:03.944
Shiro?

05:04.028 --> 05:05.362
You got it.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.954
Maybe today,
we try a little crÃ¨me goo-lée.

05:17.416 --> 05:19.209
Hmm?

05:25.007 --> 05:26.925
My eye!

05:31.513 --> 05:34.016
What is going on in here?

05:34.099 --> 05:36.977
The goo has me pinned down!

05:44.693 --> 05:47.821
Okay, we're going to have
to flank the goo to shut it down.

05:48.364 --> 05:50.366
Okay, wait. Wait!

05:50.449 --> 05:52.868
It's been a pleasure cooking with you.

05:52.951 --> 05:53.994
Go!

06:08.884 --> 06:10.803
Probably a malfunction?

06:10.886 --> 06:14.848
Yeah, yeah. Guess the kitchen system
needs to be rebooted, too.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.727
Leave it for Coran?

06:22.898 --> 06:26.485
Since when did "you sleep in it,
you clean it" become a Voltron rule?

06:26.568 --> 06:28.028
Also, how is it these pods

06:28.112 --> 06:30.531
have the ability to heal
a human from near death,

06:30.614 --> 06:32.825
but don't have the ability
to clean themselves?

06:32.908 --> 06:35.911
Self-cleaning pods.
Now, that's a good one!

06:36.537 --> 06:39.540
This kind of reminds me
of my time as a young cadet.

06:39.623 --> 06:42.334
I had just enlisted
in the Altean space squad

06:42.418 --> 06:44.420
aeronautics sub-tech
nano-weaponry unit,

06:44.503 --> 06:46.422
and I was sent off to boot camp.

06:46.505 --> 06:49.091
Our sergeant had us cleaning
cryo-pods day and night.

06:49.174 --> 06:52.190
I got so good at it,
I earned my first set of stripes!

06:52.211 --> 06:54.096
Huh?
Coran! Hey!

06:54.179 --> 06:56.306
- Oh, those were the days.
- Hey!

06:56.390 --> 06:58.100
Anyway, you keep up the good work

06:58.183 --> 07:00.727
and maybe someday you'll earn
some cleaning stripes, too.

07:02.104 --> 07:04.898
Lance? Lance!

07:04.982 --> 07:06.859
Ah, paladins...

07:15.826 --> 07:17.745
Start training level three.

07:36.221 --> 07:37.806
End training sequence.

07:39.933 --> 07:42.186
End training sequence!

07:42.269 --> 07:44.480
End training sequence now!

08:08.420 --> 08:12.758
I know you're in there, Sendak.
I know you have all the answers.

08:12.841 --> 08:14.301
Give them to me.

08:18.806 --> 08:21.975
You're a broken soldier!
You can't hold out forever!

08:26.188 --> 08:28.023
So, you can hear me.

08:37.741 --> 08:40.159
This pod just shut on me
and locked me in,

08:40.244 --> 08:42.578
while you were rambling on
about boot camp!

08:42.663 --> 08:46.250
You sure you didn't just trip and fall in?
No judgment. It happens.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.752
Besides, why would the pod
automatically lock and start

08:48.836 --> 08:50.754
the cryogenic freezing process?

08:50.838 --> 08:51.922
To kill me!

08:52.005 --> 08:55.592
Don't get your boots in a bunch.
My guess is they're malfunctioning.

08:55.676 --> 08:59.346
Okay, I'm gonna float this out there.
I think this castle is haunted.

08:59.429 --> 09:02.724
The ship might seem like a fantastical,
magical creature to you,

09:02.808 --> 09:05.602
but it's really just a big embodiment
of advanced supernatural technology

09:05.686 --> 09:07.980
that cannot be explained by science alone.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.608
Well, that does make it seem
a bit haunted, doesn't it?

09:11.692 --> 09:15.195
But it's not. Trust me, nothing out
of the ordinary is happening here.

09:18.490 --> 09:21.827
I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.586
<i>Allura?</i>

09:31.795 --> 09:33.672
<i>Allura?</i>

09:36.550 --> 09:39.386
<i>Allura, dear daughter...</i>

09:40.262 --> 09:43.056
Father, what are you doing here?

09:45.809 --> 09:46.935
Huh?

09:53.191 --> 09:54.943
Okay, okay.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.073
Coran, is that you?

10:00.157 --> 10:02.868
Okay, stop messing with me, guys.
This isn't funny.

10:02.951 --> 10:05.954
Help! Help!

10:06.038 --> 10:07.581
Hello? Coran?

10:09.041 --> 10:11.209
Help! Somebody!

10:11.293 --> 10:13.211
I'm trapped in the airlock.

10:13.295 --> 10:14.671
I'm coming!

10:15.881 --> 10:18.091
Huh?

10:20.802 --> 10:24.556
Okay, ha- ha. Good joke.
You guys got me. Nice.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.892
<i>Airlock opening in 30 ticks.</i>

10:26.975 --> 10:28.769
Okay, joke's over! You got me!

10:28.852 --> 10:33.231
<i>- ...29, 28, 27...
- Guys? Guys! Help!</i>

10:34.608 --> 10:38.320
What was the first rank
you held in Zarkon's army?

10:39.154 --> 10:41.615
Where did you find the Red Lion?

10:41.698 --> 10:44.493
What is Zarkon's greatest weakness?

10:44.576 --> 10:48.413
<i>What makes you think
you can possibly defeat him?</i>

10:52.834 --> 10:55.837
If you were to attack Zarkon,
where would you strike?

10:57.756 --> 11:02.469
<i>Why strike at all
when you can join him?</i>

11:13.271 --> 11:16.149
I bet if we can modulate
the dynamics of this crystal,

11:16.233 --> 11:18.902
we'll be able to reverse engineer
a lot of Galra tech.

11:18.985 --> 11:20.612
Don't you think, Hunk?

11:20.696 --> 11:22.656
Hunk, are you paying attention?

11:22.739 --> 11:24.658
What? No, I'm sorry.

11:24.741 --> 11:28.036
That whole food goo ambush
really set me on edge, Pidge.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.623
If we can't trust food,
we are lost as a culture.

11:31.707 --> 11:34.543
Relax. I'm sure the Castle's just glitchy.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.211
It's 10,000 years old.

11:36.294 --> 11:40.215
Yeah, it does seem like the ship
is not currently trying to kill us.

11:40.298 --> 11:43.635
Okay, so, all the sensors are
on the crystal. Hit the switch.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.642
Hunk, did you accidentally hit
the anti-gravity switch?

11:50.726 --> 11:55.522
Uh, no. There's no anti-gravity switch.
Uh, is there?

11:59.526 --> 12:01.027
Curse my short arms!

12:01.111 --> 12:03.822
Oh, I hate those little things!
All right, forget it, Pidge.

12:03.905 --> 12:06.074
I'm going to swim toward you.
Just hang on!

12:10.746 --> 12:13.540
That's it. I'm all out of moves.

12:13.623 --> 12:17.461
Oh, I'm hungry again. I hope some food goo
comes oozing out of these walls.

12:17.544 --> 12:21.381
<i>- Help! Help! Help!
- ...twelve, eleven, ten...</i>

12:21.465 --> 12:25.010
<i>...nine, eight, seven...</i>

12:26.553 --> 12:29.097
<i>- Keith!
- ...six, five...</i>

12:29.181 --> 12:30.891
What are you doing in there?

12:30.974 --> 12:34.352
I need help! Because if you don't
get me out of here right now,

12:34.436 --> 12:37.272
<i>- I'm going to be sucked out into space!
- Doors opening.</i>

12:37.355 --> 12:39.232
I'm getting sucked out into space!

12:56.291 --> 12:59.169
Keith! Keith, come on!

13:05.383 --> 13:06.843
What were you doing out there?

13:06.927 --> 13:09.513
- Who was that guy?
- He was trying to kill me!

13:09.596 --> 13:12.682
Well, is he the Castle?
Because that's who's trying to kill me!

13:17.521 --> 13:20.899
<i>Altean flowers are the most beautiful.</i>

13:20.982 --> 13:24.569
It is sad that I will only
see them in my dreams.

13:24.653 --> 13:29.866
But, when I wake, my memories are
like these spores, scattered in the wind.

13:29.950 --> 13:33.245
<i>Altea is not merely a dream, Allura.</i>

13:33.328 --> 13:35.872
<i>It still exists.</i>

13:35.956 --> 13:38.792
<i>The Altean flower, you can see it.</i>

13:38.875 --> 13:40.627
<i>You can touch it.</i>

13:41.545 --> 13:45.423
<i>I can take you there.
I can take you home.</i>

13:45.507 --> 13:47.050
You can?

13:47.133 --> 13:53.098
<i>- Would you like to go home?
- Yes. I want to go back to Altea, Father.</i>

13:53.807 --> 13:57.686
<i>Then come with me,
and I will show you the way.</i>

14:02.440 --> 14:06.194
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I have an idea. Grab on!

14:08.530 --> 14:12.868
- Yeah! We did it! Now, what?
- Now, kick me as hard as you can!

14:12.951 --> 14:14.786
What? No, we're friends.

14:14.870 --> 14:19.332
No, no. Kick me so I can fly across
the room and get to the control panel.

14:24.754 --> 14:26.673
Oh... oh, oh!

14:26.756 --> 14:28.133
No, no, no!

14:33.305 --> 14:37.142
How can you guys be taking a nap
while this castle is trying to kill us?

14:37.225 --> 14:41.438
Taking a nap? We've been floating around
in Zero G! You know how scary that is?

14:41.521 --> 14:44.983
That's not scary! That's fun!
I was almost ejected into space!

14:45.066 --> 14:48.695
I got attacked by killer food, and that's
the most horrifying thing you can imagine!

14:48.778 --> 14:51.323
The stuff of nightmares!
It'll haunt me to my grave!

14:51.406 --> 14:53.742
Well, I had a robot trying to kill me!

14:53.825 --> 14:58.121
I don't care what you say, Coran.
This castle has gone apples and bananas!

14:58.205 --> 15:01.333
Perhaps the infection
from Sendak's Galra crystal

15:01.416 --> 15:03.043
is worse than we thought.

15:03.126 --> 15:05.879
- Well, let's get rid of it.
- It's too late.

15:05.962 --> 15:09.591
When Sendak plugged it into the ship,
it corrupted the entire system.

15:09.674 --> 15:13.720
Sendak? Wait. Has anyone seen Shiro?

15:15.847 --> 15:18.558
<i>We're connected, you and me.</i>

15:19.392 --> 15:22.479
<i>Both part of the Galra Empire.</i>

15:22.562 --> 15:25.106
No! I'm not like you.

15:25.190 --> 15:30.362
<i>You've been broken and reformed.
Just look at your hand.</i>

15:31.571 --> 15:33.031
That's not me!

15:33.114 --> 15:37.452
<i>It's the strongest part of you.
Embrace it.</i>

15:37.535 --> 15:42.874
<i>The others don't know what you know.
They haven't seen what you've seen.</i>

15:42.958 --> 15:46.670
<i>Face it. You'll never beat Zarkon.</i>

15:46.753 --> 15:49.381
<i>He's already defeated you.</i>

15:49.464 --> 15:51.049
I'm not listening to you!

15:51.132 --> 15:56.221
<i>Do you really think a monster like you
could be a Voltron Paladin?</i>

15:56.304 --> 15:57.430
Stop it!

16:12.112 --> 16:16.199
<i>I remember how you used to dance
around this very ballroom.</i>

16:16.283 --> 16:18.535
<i>I can still hear you giggling.</i>

16:18.618 --> 16:19.619
Oh...

16:19.703 --> 16:21.830
Those were happy memories.

16:21.913 --> 16:25.250
<i>We can create new memories, Allura.</i>

16:37.762 --> 16:39.556
Shiro, are you okay?

16:39.639 --> 16:43.018
- Where's Sendak?
- I... I had to get him out of here.

16:43.101 --> 16:46.396
I was hearing his voice.
He... He can't be trusted on this ship.

16:46.479 --> 16:50.191
It is the ship! I got stuck in a cryo-pod,
then, in an airlock.

16:50.275 --> 16:53.653
Keith got attacked by a robot,
and Hunk and Pidge got attacked by food.

16:53.737 --> 16:56.740
It's been a weird morning.

16:56.823 --> 16:59.993
- What? How is that possible?
- What is it?

17:00.076 --> 17:02.329
The ship is starting a wormhole jump!

17:09.877 --> 17:11.588
Allura, what's going on?

17:12.339 --> 17:15.633
We're going to Altea.
We're going home.

17:15.717 --> 17:18.011
My father is taking us.

17:18.887 --> 17:21.765
<i>Stay away from my daughter!</i>

17:21.848 --> 17:24.351
- Uh...
- Allura, wake up!

17:24.434 --> 17:27.979
The crystal must have corrupted
King Alfor's artificial intelligence.

17:28.063 --> 17:29.356
It's taking over!

17:35.362 --> 17:38.740
We're headed straight for a star
and it's about to explode!

17:45.497 --> 17:48.583
Father, I can see Altea.

17:48.666 --> 17:53.004
Allura! Allura, wake up!
What you're seeing isn't real.

18:00.261 --> 18:04.724
The juniberries,
the most exquisite flower of all.

18:04.808 --> 18:07.519
<i>Allura, please!
You've got to listen to me!</i>

18:08.353 --> 18:10.188
Is this real?

18:10.271 --> 18:15.902
<i>Of course it is real, Daughter.
That flower you're touching is real.</i>

18:15.985 --> 18:19.614
<i>But where is the fragrance
of the sweet juniberries?</i>

18:20.824 --> 18:22.659
Huh?

18:29.332 --> 18:31.501
That's not Altea.

18:31.584 --> 18:34.629
When that star goes supernova,
it will destroy the entire system.

18:34.712 --> 18:37.590
Allura, you must reset the course
and get us out of here!

18:41.344 --> 18:44.389
Father, please, I beg you
to turn this ship around.

18:44.472 --> 18:46.891
If we don't do it soon,
we will all perish!

18:46.975 --> 18:50.103
<i>I know. That is my intention.</i>

18:50.186 --> 18:52.188
What? Why?

18:52.272 --> 18:57.193
<i>Don't you see, dear daughter?
Zarkon can never be defeated.</i>

18:57.277 --> 19:00.196
<i>He's been ruling for ten thousand years.</i>

19:00.280 --> 19:02.449
But we must continue to fight!

19:02.532 --> 19:06.619
<i>Fight for what? It is all over for Altea.</i>

19:06.703 --> 19:09.539
<i>You don't have to live a lifetime of war.</i>

19:09.622 --> 19:13.042
<i>You can be with me
and the rest of your people.</i>

19:13.126 --> 19:17.464
Father, please! The paladins and I
can still stop Zarkon!

19:17.547 --> 19:20.884
Somewhere in there,
you must want that to happen.

19:20.967 --> 19:25.138
<i>Allura, my A.I. has been corrupted.
You must disconnect my power source.</i>

19:25.221 --> 19:30.935
<i>We can stroll across the Blossom Canyon
every morning, just like we used to.</i>

19:31.019 --> 19:34.272
<i>Remember how much you loved that?</i>

19:34.355 --> 19:37.609
I remember. I'll see you soon, Father.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.279
I've got to get into the A.I. chamber

19:41.362 --> 19:44.032
to disconnect my father's
power source manually.

19:44.115 --> 19:46.910
But that means losing King Alfor forever!

19:47.952 --> 19:53.041
Paladins, get to your lions! I need you to
slow the Castle's descent into the star.

19:53.124 --> 19:56.586
I can try to override the system
to open the hangars.

20:11.392 --> 20:12.393
<i>Don't do this!</i>

20:13.102 --> 20:14.020
<i>You must.</i>

20:14.103 --> 20:17.357
<i>All my memories,
all my knowledge will be lost forever!</i>

20:17.440 --> 20:21.486
<i>Do it, Allura. If you are to live,
we must say goodbye.</i>

20:21.569 --> 20:23.530
I'm sorry about this, Father.

20:40.755 --> 20:43.007
<i>- Huh?
- Oh, my dear daughter...</i>

20:49.222 --> 20:51.140
<i>Father...</i>

20:51.808 --> 20:55.103
This is not real.
This is all in the past.

21:11.327 --> 21:13.454
<i>You don't have to fight, Allura.</i>

21:13.538 --> 21:17.041
<i>You don't have to make this sacrifice.</i>

21:23.256 --> 21:24.882
Goodbye, Father.

21:26.342 --> 21:28.803
<i>Goodbye, Allura.</i>

21:49.032 --> 21:50.700
She did it.

21:57.123 --> 22:00.877
<i>Paladins, get to your hangars.
We're getting out of here.</i>

22:27.987 --> 22:30.323
I'm so sorry about your father, Princess.

22:30.406 --> 22:32.116
We all are.

22:32.784 --> 22:36.162
Thank you. But that was not my father.

22:36.245 --> 22:40.541
The real King Alfor was a great man
and a great father.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.315
He may not be here with us anymore,

22:43.316 --> 22:46.005
but his dream lives
on through all of us,

22:46.089 --> 22:49.233
and his legacy is Voltron.
