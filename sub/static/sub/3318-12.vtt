Guarded, day and night.

I hope you weren't

02:39.393 --> 02:41.527
Just the fact that we've had
no news from the vatican.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.362
And will you worrying

That's not all

02:55.843 --> 02:57.709
Your half brothers,
charles and henry...

02:57.711 --> 02:59.211
(sighs)

02:59.213 --> 03:00.679
...I see their sad faces
around the castle

And I realize how hard
this must be for them.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.883
It's awful; I know.

There's a frost fair
in the village this morning.

I want to take them,
just us three.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.694
As something special to take
their minds off their troubles.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.965
You are so good.
So truly good.

(laughs)

03:26.673 --> 03:28.540
(horse sputters)

03:31.444 --> 03:32.678
Will there be ice skating?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.946
Yes, and sleigh rides

03:33.948 --> 03:36.715
And spice candy
and puppet plays.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.319
And all the boys and girls
from the village will be there.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.855
Mother and father don't like us
playing with regular children.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.591
(sighing): I wish mother
could be there.

03:46.693 --> 03:47.826
I know.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.628
Will we see her...

03:49.630 --> 03:50.696
Before she dies?

03:50.698 --> 03:52.698
Don't worry about that now.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.733
Your mother wants you
to be happy.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.636
And she'll be happier knowing
that you've had a lovely day.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.538
Guard: Coming through.
Look out!

03:59.540 --> 04:00.806
Look out!

04:00.808 --> 04:03.709
Get back! All of you!
What's going on?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.377
Look! It's the medici princes!

04:05.379 --> 04:07.613
Death to queen catherine
and her line!

04:07.615 --> 04:10.349
Your days are numbered,
spawn of that medici whore.
Get down.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.664
Catherine (whispering):
Hey.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.733
Who's there?

04:29.469 --> 04:30.669
Show yourself.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.844
I won't take the blame
if you've stolen from the queen.

<i>Where are my boys now?</i>

04:57.831 --> 04:59.665
Bash is with them.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.568
I warned you of the unrest
that would result

05:03.570 --> 05:05.604
From changing
the line of succession.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.005
Once the vatican
legitimizes bash,

05:07.007 --> 05:08.774
Henry will take off my head,

05:08.776 --> 05:10.976
Those boys will be orphans.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.678
They'll still have their father.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.579
How much attention do you think
they'll get from him

05:14.581 --> 05:16.848
As he cavorts with
his new bride diane?

05:16.850 --> 05:20.352
And as for bash,
as soon as he takes power,

05:20.354 --> 05:23.422
He will face unrelenting
pressure to do away with them.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.556
I will not allow it.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.024
I will take care of them.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.527
You?
And bash, as well.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.996
We will raise them
as if they were our own.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.564
Despite what you may think,

05:32.566 --> 05:35.100
I never intended
to harm your family.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.669
I just wanted
to save francis.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.771
I wish I could believe that.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.541
And I want
to help clarissa, too.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.078
Clarissa?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.479
Yes, she is your daughter.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.480
We both know that.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.715
And she saved my life.

05:51.050 --> 05:54.820
How do you intend on
coaxing her out of the passages?

05:54.822 --> 05:57.723
I've ordered a mask made,
to cover her deformity.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.125
It's being delivered today.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.827
And then when the time is right,

06:01.829 --> 06:04.763
I will arrange for her
to have chambers of her own.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.099
You seriously intend to
integrate her into society,

06:07.101 --> 06:08.834
After a life in the shadows,

06:08.836 --> 06:10.769
Living like vermin?

06:10.771 --> 06:13.705
That girl is broken,
she is more animal than human.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.507
(sighs)

06:15.509 --> 06:17.776
The greatest mercy
would be to have her put down.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.445
You don't mean that.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.949
You would never want that
for your own child.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.651
I suppose I'll have to
get used to other people

06:26.653 --> 06:29.888
Deciding what I want
for my children.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.458
They'll be out of my care,
very shortly, when I'm dead.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.130
Which one's your marble?

06:38.132 --> 06:39.731
It's that one.

I marvel that you could have
been brought up at court

07:44.565 --> 07:47.032
And still
understand it so poorly.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.901
For a royal, there's
no such thing as safety.

07:49.903 --> 07:50.936
I realize the notion
of my being king

07:50.938 --> 07:52.871
Disappoints you, lord hugo.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.039
It did once.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.007
But not anymore.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.177
Mary:
You've switched sides?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.213
I'm head of the king's
privy council for two reasons:

08:01.215 --> 08:02.747
I know how to manage men

08:02.749 --> 08:05.484
And I know how
to pick the winning side.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.953
In light of recent events,

08:07.955 --> 08:09.955
The queen's pending execution

08:09.957 --> 08:11.823
And francis's continuing
absence from court...

08:11.825 --> 08:13.892
That side is yours.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.194
How lucky I am to have
such steadfast support.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.762
If steadfast is
what you require,

08:17.764 --> 08:19.998
There's only one way
to achieve it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.600
Factions need a flag
to rally behind,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.268
And every young prince
with a claim to the throne

08:23.270 --> 08:24.903
Is another flag.

08:26.072 --> 08:29.007
But, if those flags
were taken away...

08:30.877 --> 08:33.645
...Perhaps permanently...

08:33.647 --> 08:35.046
Are you suggesting...

08:35.048 --> 08:36.815
Killing the boys?!

08:36.817 --> 08:39.651
I would never presume
to make such a suggestion.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.887
Those boys are
the king's own blood.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.891
You asked about safety.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.659
This morning's attack was mild.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.995
We are aware of that
and share your concern.

08:49.997 --> 08:54.232
There are plots being set
on both sides, no doubt...

08:54.234 --> 08:57.135
And with deadlier consequences.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.137
Sooner or later,
blood will be spilled.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.307
It's just a matter of whose.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.776
Yours and mary's...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.747
...Or another's.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.885
Lord hugo's right--

09:13.887 --> 09:15.854
My brothers need
to be dealt with.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.589
"dealt with"?
What are you saying?

09:17.591 --> 09:18.890
Send them away from France.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.926
I was sent to
a nunnery at six.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.794
It didn't stop the english
from making attempts on my life.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.696
You've had far more attempts
against your life here.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.897
You weren't there this morning.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.899
Those boys need our protection

09:27.901 --> 09:30.035
And I promised catherine
I would keep them safe.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.736
We should keep them
here with us.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.038
And teach them
to be constantly afraid?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.774
Always on the lookout
for the next attack?

09:35.776 --> 09:38.176
I won't have them grow up
to fear their own shadows.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.345
At least they'll have a chance
of a normal childhood.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.279
"normal?"

09:41.281 --> 09:43.014
At court?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.583
This is absurd.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.585
You feel guilty for
taking away what they had,

09:46.587 --> 09:47.919
So you want to keep them around,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.955
Never mind what
their lives might be like--

09:49.957 --> 09:51.122
And you feel guilty because
they remind you of francis,

09:51.124 --> 09:53.992
So you want to get them
out of sight.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.927
Is that really what you think?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.630
It doesn't matter.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.231
I forbid you from
sending them away.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.232
You forbid it?

10:01.234 --> 10:03.635
How is this your decision?

10:03.637 --> 10:06.304
I am the queen who's
going to give your father

10:06.306 --> 10:09.074
The legacy
of conquering England.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.675
Who do you think
he's going to side with?

10:12.211 --> 10:13.745
Very well.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.281
I'll go double the guard
around the boys.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.050
Unless that means
I don't love them enough.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.854
(sighs)

10:34.834 --> 10:36.768

10:38.838 --> 10:41.006

10:55.688 --> 10:57.389

11:00.126 --> 11:01.159
Fredrick:
Lola?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.094
Fredrick!

11:05.097 --> 11:06.698
Are you all right?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.033
Have they
mistreated you?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.434
I'm fine...
As long as you brought the...

11:09.436 --> 11:11.069
I brought the money.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.971
Thank god. Sorry you had
to come all the way.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.005
You wouldn't believe the string

11:14.007 --> 11:16.141
Of bad luck I've had
at the tables.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.076
Let's just get you out of here.
To whom do you owe the money?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.711
Man:
Maurice bisset.

11:19.713 --> 11:23.081
Please excuse the trouble
my brother has caused.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.017
Here's the sum he owes,
plus interest.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.154
How lucky you are
to have such a
lovely sister

11:29.156 --> 11:31.823
Willing to go to such lengths
to secure your release.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.191
Shall we?

11:36.162 --> 11:37.896
Unfortunately,
this debt

11:37.898 --> 11:40.098
Is more complicated.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.966
What do you mean?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.468
In addition to lying
about his means,

11:43.470 --> 11:46.204
Your brother attempted
to cheat at my tables,

11:46.206 --> 11:50.442
A very serious breach
of house rules.

11:50.444 --> 11:53.144
Perhaps an additional sum
would help smooth things over.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.414
Such a grave crime requires
more than money

11:56.416 --> 11:58.083
To repay it, don't you think?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.784
What are you suggesting?

11:59.786 --> 12:01.152
I admire

12:01.154 --> 12:03.021
The passion you have
for your brother.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.723
Perhaps you would
consider sharing

12:04.725 --> 12:06.758
Some of that passion...

12:06.760 --> 12:07.759
With me.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.229
(door creaks)

12:11.231 --> 12:12.330
(door slams)

12:12.332 --> 12:13.932
I need to see
the prisoner.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.867
And what is this
that you're bringing?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.068
A bible.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.471
So she can make peace
with her maker

12:19.473 --> 12:21.773
Before her execution.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.742
If you're looking
for a weapon,

12:23.744 --> 12:26.144
Some say there's none greater
than the scriptures themselves.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.320
Oh, good.

12:35.322 --> 12:38.490
More sanctimonious talk
from my self-appointed redeemer.

12:38.492 --> 12:41.025
King henry's actions
may not have been fair,

12:41.027 --> 12:42.260
But it doesn't change

12:42.262 --> 12:43.928
The results.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.030
You must seek absolution
for your sins.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.202
You think that
is gonna save me?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.971
If you really cared
about my well-being,

12:52.973 --> 12:55.039
You'd have brought some
poison like I asked!

12:55.041 --> 12:57.108
Then, at least,
I could die with dignity,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.443
Alone, at my own hand.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.044
You mustn't say such things.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.480
Suicide is
a mortal sin!

13:02.482 --> 13:04.282
You'd be condemned
to the fires of hell.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.452
Henry intends to make
a spectacle of my death,

13:07.454 --> 13:09.287
As a final insult to me,

13:09.289 --> 13:13.057
And to bring some semblance
of validity to his actions.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.059
I won't grant him
the satisfaction,

13:15.061 --> 13:18.329
If I have to tear my throat out
with my own hands!

13:18.331 --> 13:22.300
And unless you're
prepared to help me
in that goal, get out.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.202
And don't return.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.215
(door shuts)

13:45.457 --> 13:47.458
What's going on?

13:49.195 --> 13:50.595
Bash, what have
you done?

13:52.231 --> 13:54.165
Charles:
This is all for us?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.167
Yes.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.402
Now go make friends.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.338
You said
they should have

14:00.340 --> 14:02.307
A normal childhood,
but also be safe.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.343
They missed out
on the frost fair
in the village, so...

14:05.345 --> 14:07.178
Mary:
You brought it to them.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.314
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever seen.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.483
Bash:
Their entire lives are filled
with danger and isolation.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.254
I just wanted them
to have this day.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.291
Mary, come help us
with our masks!

14:33.472 --> 14:34.939
I've made some
arrangements.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.274
I can pay you double
the debt,

14:36.276 --> 14:38.276
But it'll take a week
to assemble the money.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.211
I don't think so.

14:43.115 --> 14:44.382
Well done.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.318
What incredible luck
you must have.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.922
(man screaming)

14:53.592 --> 14:55.393
He's a cheat,
just like your brother.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.995
Was that really necessary?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.264
He's lucky I didn't crush
both his hands.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.332
That's the penalty
at most establishments,

15:01.334 --> 15:03.568
But I prefer to be merciful.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.404
Your brother begged me
to spare him that fate.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.573
He said that
your family was wealthy,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.975
And that he'd make it
worth my while.

15:10.977 --> 15:14.379
I had no idea how worthwhile
until I laid my eyes on you.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.047
Why me?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.916
You can't make this offer
to many.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.150
It's not good business.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.551
You're a lady of title.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.387
I've taken money
from many a noble,

15:22.389 --> 15:24.622
But none ever treated me
as an equal.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.059
I'd like to know
what it feels like

15:28.061 --> 15:29.961
To touch what only
they can touch.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.529
Do we have a deal?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.431
Pardon me.
I couldn't help

15:33.433 --> 15:34.565
But overhear
that this lady

15:34.567 --> 15:36.367
Is to be played for
this evening.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.436
My benefactor,
the viscount de brilhac,

15:38.438 --> 15:41.072
Would like the chance
to win her for himself.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.607
She's not available.
She's with me.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.609
The viscount
is prepared to wager

15:44.611 --> 15:48.246
Double her debt
on one cut of the cards.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.949
I've already
been offered that.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.550
Francis:
Four times, then.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.225
Burgundy house is not afraid
of a simple wager?

16:02.461 --> 16:05.029
One cut of the cards.

16:05.031 --> 16:08.366
Four times the debt,
plus the girl if I win.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.369
And if I win,
the debt is forgiven,

16:11.371 --> 16:13.438
And the girl is mine.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.286
Too bad,
monsieur viscount.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.354
Double it again.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.588
(patrons gasp)

16:30.590 --> 16:32.323
Eight times the debt, you mean?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.058
And the girl.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.594
Though I don't know
why you'd risk it.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.430
It's much safer
to just take the money.

16:39.432 --> 16:44.535
If your gallantry is as easy
as your lovely inherited money,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.437
Why not make it 16 times
the debt?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.373
No.
Very well.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.309
After you.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.513
(patrons gasp)

16:55.515 --> 16:57.148
(chuckles)

17:04.656 --> 17:07.158
(applause)

17:07.160 --> 17:09.527
Well-played.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.262
Luck of the draw.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.166
Shall we retire
to my room, my lady?

17:15.168 --> 17:17.668
Wait.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.637
You look familiar.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.672
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.675
I'm told I look like

17:24.677 --> 17:26.144
The dauphin of France...
Only taller.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.716
Kenna:
Well, I agree with mary.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.217
They should stay here,

17:33.219 --> 17:34.552
At the home
they've always known.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.487
Look at them, having
the time of their lives.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.723
Who's that?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.426
I don't know.
Some servant, perhaps?

17:41.428 --> 17:43.528
He looks ill at ease,
don't you think?
Boy:
Ow!

17:43.530 --> 17:45.730
Charles! Oh, charles.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.532
(laughing):
Come here.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.633
Are you all right?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.703
Charles?
Henry?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.372
Charles?
Henry?

17:55.841 --> 17:57.308
What is it?

17:57.310 --> 17:59.710
We can't find the princes.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.512
Bash:
Everyone!

18:01.514 --> 18:02.847
Masks off at once!

18:07.219 --> 18:08.686
Bash.

18:11.123 --> 18:12.256
They're gone.

18:17.362 --> 18:18.362
Search the castle
and the grounds,

18:18.364 --> 18:20.131
They can't have gone far.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.434
And check the boys' chambers.
And find lord hugo!

18:23.436 --> 18:25.436
Mary, wait.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.838
What are you doing?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.272
You're wasting precious time!

18:29.308 --> 18:31.476
The boys are fine.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.311
How do you know?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.179
Because I arranged
their disappearance.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.481
What?!

18:36.483 --> 18:37.515
They're being transported

18:37.517 --> 18:39.484
To the abbey
at troyes as we speak.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.352
From there, they'll continue
to the spanish border.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.387
There are riders stationed
at checkpoints along the way

18:43.389 --> 18:45.456
To keep us up to date
on their progress.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.493
You had this plan in mind
all along.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.495
That's why you wanted
your brothers outside.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.230
You were planning
their kidnapping!

18:52.232 --> 18:54.465
They weren't safe here.
Something had to be done.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.400
Lord hugo: Sebastian.
There you are.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.170
We found this man hiding
in the woods.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.738
He had a rope
and two burlap sacks.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.375
I believe he intended to capture
and drown the princes.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.743
Is this true?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.778
You are the next great king,
sebastian.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.915
The medicis must die.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.617
Lord hugo: We'll question him
thoroughly, my lord.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.418
If he knows anything about
the princes' disappearance,

19:14.420 --> 19:15.520
We'll get it out of him.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.273
(horse nickers)

19:37.609 --> 19:39.510
Out you get.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.316
We'll go inside where
no one can see us.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.517
There. Right.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.952
Get some food in you.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.687
We've got a long night
ahead of us

19:49.689 --> 19:51.489
If we're going to make it
to troyes before daylight.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.191
Charles:
I'm cold.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.393
Go on then.
I'll fetch a blanket.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.537
Woman (whispering):
Hey.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.673
Who's there?

20:19.985 --> 20:21.552
Clarissa,
what are you doing here?

20:21.554 --> 20:24.956
I was worried about you.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.326
Clarissa is my friend.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.628
We played together
at the castle.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.497
How did you find us?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.499
Does anyone know
you're here?

20:35.501 --> 20:37.535
Your mother will know
soon enough.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.538
I left her a message.

20:40.540 --> 20:44.709
Why are you wearing
the driver's cloak
and that mask?

20:44.711 --> 20:47.411
Mary had it made for me.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.581
Do you like it?

20:50.583 --> 20:51.649
I don't know.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.584
Are you going to stay with us?

20:53.586 --> 20:56.988
I'm going to take care of you.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.991
From now on,
we're going to be a family.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.495
Pack up. Let's go.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.738
Thank you again, so much,
for what you did.

21:13.740 --> 21:17.375
To make such an enormous wager
based on nothing but chance.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.543
Well, it's safer
than fighting our way out.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.711
(laughs quietly)

21:22.481 --> 21:23.648
My brother...

21:23.650 --> 21:25.349
Seems a little adrift.

21:25.351 --> 21:26.751
I've traipsed

21:26.753 --> 21:29.287
All over europe, pulling him out
of this scrape or that,

21:29.289 --> 21:31.455
Each time
worse than the last.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.025
But we're all my parents
have left.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.827
I can understand both sides,
if you want the truth.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.697
I am familiar
with feeling adrift.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.000
And with being let down
by a brother I loved.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.403
I'm sorry.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.471
Truly, I am.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.810
I know they thought
they were saving my life,

21:52.812 --> 21:54.545
Or at least mary did.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.748
Bash has his own reasons.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.519
I envy you.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.788
(chuckles)

22:03.790 --> 22:05.389
In what possible way?

22:05.391 --> 22:07.391
Well, you've escaped
that hideous court.

22:07.393 --> 22:10.561
You're not bound
by duty or politics.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.763
You don't have to lie
or pretend.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.865
You can do what you want.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.534
You can set your own course.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.870
Well, it's not all
it's cracked up to be,

22:19.872 --> 22:22.106
But there are things
I don't miss.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.541
Like my mother's meddling,
for one.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.076
(chuckles)

22:25.078 --> 22:27.345
When I left, henry had her
locked in the tower,

22:27.347 --> 22:29.080
Just until the annulment
came through,

22:29.082 --> 22:31.882
But that didn't stop her
from stirring up trouble.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.719
She tried to get
mary and bash...

22:35.654 --> 22:36.954
What?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.623
You don't want to hear it.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.691
I do.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.961
Hearing it makes it real.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.531
It still doesn't feel that way.

22:50.902 --> 22:52.703
Don't be ashamed of your pain.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.739
It does you credit.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.575
You have a true heart.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.677
It will mend.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.048
I'd like that very much.

23:08.587 --> 23:09.887
Shall we...

23:09.889 --> 23:12.390
Shall we find something

23:12.392 --> 23:14.859
To keep us occupied

23:14.861 --> 23:16.894
Until we can sleep?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.663
Yes, please.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.037
(bird screeches, door slams)

23:27.039 --> 23:28.906
What is it?
Guard: I heard coughing,
and now she won't answer.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.075
Did you check on her?
She's blocked the
door with something.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.743
I heard what she said before
about taking her life.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.612
(pounding)
open the door at once!

23:34.614 --> 23:36.747
Help me push it in! Quickly!

23:38.650 --> 23:40.651
Dear god.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.696
Untie the rope.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.202
(grunting with effort)

23:58.204 --> 24:00.204
I must get her to the
infirmary immediately.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.606
What for? Would it not be
a kindness to let her pass on?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.608
The king wants her death
to be a spectacle.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.510
Will you be the one
to deny him that?

24:06.512 --> 24:08.679
I'll be back with her
as soon as I can.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.014
Tell no one.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.116
And pray, for both our sakes,

24:12.118 --> 24:15.085
That I'm successful
in reviving her.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.462
Nostradamus:
You're safe now.

24:24.464 --> 24:27.231
Oh, thank god.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.666
Ooh.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.167
Help me with this.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.136
It's digging into my back
like a butcher's hook.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.971
(grunts)

24:33.973 --> 24:35.539
You're lucky it held
your weight

24:35.541 --> 24:37.141
Or you'd have hung yourself
for real.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.809
You're lucky
they didn't find it hidden

24:38.811 --> 24:41.045
In the spine of that bible
you brought.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.514
Lying isn't exactly
your strong suit.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.150
Now, where am I meeting
the wagon?

24:46.152 --> 24:48.152
At the east end of the grounds.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.687
Past the stables.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.855
It won't be comfortable, but...

24:50.857 --> 24:53.524
It's my only chance of making it

24:53.526 --> 24:54.825
To Italy undetected.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.528
(sighs)

24:57.530 --> 24:59.630
What is it?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.066
Something you need to know.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.735
Charles and young henry
went missing today

25:04.737 --> 25:06.036
At the frost fair.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.771
Missing?

25:07.773 --> 25:09.173
Do you mean kidnapped?

25:09.175 --> 25:10.808
It's too early to say.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.511
Bash has sent guards
to search for them.
Bash?

25:13.513 --> 25:16.647
So the fox has offered to help
find the missing chickens?

25:16.649 --> 25:17.915
We don't know
that he was responsible

25:17.917 --> 25:19.283
For their disappearance.
(scoffs)

25:19.285 --> 25:21.652
Of course it's bash
or one of his backers.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.721
Who else would profit
from my son's removal?

25:23.723 --> 25:24.955
(sighs)

25:24.957 --> 25:27.725
My sweet boys...

25:27.727 --> 25:30.794
Oh, they'll be terrified
if they're even...

25:33.832 --> 25:35.900
You must go
to your rendezvous.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.302
The guards will be
searching for you.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.037
And abandon my children?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.772
You can't help them from here.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.774
You're a condemned woman.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.777
Go to Italy,
gather your strength.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.912
Others will see

25:47.914 --> 25:49.313
To the safety
of your children here.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.981
Others?

25:50.983 --> 25:52.750
I'm their mother.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.853
I will not leave this place
until I know

25:55.855 --> 25:59.557
That my boys are safe
or until I am actually dead.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.692
What do you mean the boys didn't
make it to the checkpoint?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.794
They're probably fine.

26:03.796 --> 26:04.895
The carriage could've
lost a wheel

26:04.897 --> 26:06.797
Or a horse come up lame.

26:06.799 --> 26:07.965
I've ordered guards
to ride out and look.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.233
And what if
they don't find them?

26:09.235 --> 26:11.101
Are you still so pleased
with your choice

26:11.103 --> 26:12.970
To defy me and act so rashly?

26:12.972 --> 26:14.872
There's no guarantee they'd
have been any safer here.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.974
A servant of catherine's
was just found dead

26:16.976 --> 26:18.842
In a passage behind
her chambers.

26:18.844 --> 26:22.212
Along with this box.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.616
The queen's enemies
are growing bolder--

26:25.618 --> 26:27.318
Even in this castle
which you deem so safe.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.620
They're keepsakes.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.355
Mementos of her children.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.924
So few people know

26:33.926 --> 26:35.859
Of the passageways.
Who would hide a body there?

26:35.861 --> 26:37.962
I'm going to talk to the guards
who found her.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.030
I'll tell you
if I learn anything.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.234
(gasps)

26:45.637 --> 26:46.804
(gasps)
please don't scream.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.105
I mean you no harm.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.040
How did you...?
I escaped, my dear.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.042
I hid waiting.
It's all very thrilling,

26:52.044 --> 26:54.278
But let's save that tale
for later.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.348
My sons are missing, and you
promised to protect them.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.049
Bash has sent men after them,

26:59.051 --> 27:01.151
And he knows where to look,
since he's the one

27:01.153 --> 27:03.621
Who spirited them
away for their safety.

27:03.623 --> 27:04.888
"for their safety"?

27:04.890 --> 27:06.724
Is that what he told you?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.926
I know this might be hard
for you to understand,

27:08.928 --> 27:12.096
But bash cares for his brothers
more than any crown.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.898
Besides, I think it might be
another sibling

27:14.900 --> 27:16.300
Who's interested.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.302
You keep locks of your
children's hair,

27:18.304 --> 27:21.038
But I don't believe you added
this one to the collection.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.940
Is that skin?

27:22.942 --> 27:24.642
I think it's clarissa's.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.811
She killed the servant

27:27.813 --> 27:29.013
That bash
was talking about.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.047
Who else uses the passages?

27:30.049 --> 27:32.116
Who else would rather kill

27:32.118 --> 27:34.151
Than risk exposure
in the light?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.987
Look at how it's knotted
around your sons',

27:36.989 --> 27:39.256
Charles and little henry's.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.992
Who else do you know who
might feel like this,

27:41.994 --> 27:44.161
All knotted up inside
over a family

27:44.163 --> 27:46.163
She just learned she had?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.032
She threatened me once.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.900
She said that I would get
what I deserved,

27:49.902 --> 27:51.835
But what does that mean?

27:51.837 --> 27:55.005
I think she wants you to know
she has your sons.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.975
To torment you
in your final days

27:57.977 --> 27:59.810
Before your execution.

27:59.812 --> 28:03.047
You said bash knows
the direction they went in.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.048
Can he track them?

28:04.050 --> 28:06.016
Francis always went on and on

28:06.018 --> 28:07.251
About his brother's
hunting skills.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.952
He can, and I'll be with him.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.154
I'm coming with you.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.022
I know.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.258
I'll probably be caught,
returned to my chains,

28:14.260 --> 28:16.093
But these are my children.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.762
And if it's me
that clarissa wants to punish,

28:18.764 --> 28:21.131
I need to be there
to let her have her say.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.978
(distant bell tolling)

28:36.414 --> 28:38.482
(horse whinnying)

28:41.720 --> 28:42.953
I'm so sorry.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.421
I-I must have nodded off.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.890
Me, too.
We were talking very late.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.892
And the wine.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.427
Yes, and the wine.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.963
I should go.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.934
Thank you for what
you did yesterday

28:56.936 --> 28:58.102
For me and my brother.

28:58.104 --> 29:01.739
It was brave and
incredibly gallant.

29:01.741 --> 29:04.274
And I'm so sorry to
have imposed on you.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.976
It was no imposition.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.978
Truly, it was nice
to spend time with someone

29:07.980 --> 29:11.749
Who I...
Didn't have to hide from.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.052
I'm sorry;
you don't want to hear this.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.286
Yes, I do.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.889
Please, finish.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.062
To anyone else, I'm a young man
who has everything--

29:25.064 --> 29:27.464
Money, freedom,

29:27.466 --> 29:30.768
A world to explore
at my leisure.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.537
But when I think
of all that,

29:33.539 --> 29:36.206
I only feel...

29:36.208 --> 29:38.308
Emptiness.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.011
Pathetic, isn't it?

29:41.013 --> 29:43.147
Well, I hope not.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.949
Because I feel
exactly the same.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.256
We're a pathetic pair,
aren't we?

29:52.258 --> 29:54.324
(chuckles)

30:01.533 --> 30:03.534
We can't. Mary...

30:03.536 --> 30:05.269
Is no longer a part of my life.

30:05.271 --> 30:08.338
Like it or not,
she's made her decision.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.308
And I'll never see her again.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.511
Or me, after today.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.285
I can't ask you to...

30:21.287 --> 30:23.053
Give up my virtue?

30:23.055 --> 30:24.588
Don't worry,
I've known a man before.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.890
Just one, but...

30:26.892 --> 30:28.959
Francis, I want to.

30:31.529 --> 30:33.964
♪

30:47.378 --> 30:49.947
(bird caws, horse splutters)

30:49.949 --> 30:53.917
It's the driver I hired to take
the boys to troyes.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.953
There's no blood
other than his.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.221
No reason to fear
the worst just yet.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.957
Yes, except my boys
are still missing

30:59.959 --> 31:01.558
And perhaps in the
hands of a monster.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.027
I swear, if she harms a hair
on their heads, I...

31:04.029 --> 31:05.529
Mary:
Charles and clarissa

31:05.531 --> 31:06.864
Have played together
many times.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.899
She's been friendly towards him.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.235
Bash: We should split up
to cover more ground.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.036
Even with several hours
head start,

31:13.038 --> 31:14.972
A girl and two small boys
couldn't have made it far.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.640
Hyah! Hyah!

31:16.642 --> 31:18.008
Hyah!

31:18.010 --> 31:19.910
We're going to find them.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.345
You have my word.
And believe me,

31:21.347 --> 31:23.213
If they're anything but
the picture of health,

31:23.215 --> 31:25.415
I'm the one
you'll have to restrain.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.450
Bash, look...

31:33.524 --> 31:35.492
It's little henry's.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.927
This way!

31:39.097 --> 31:41.331
She's no mother.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.001
She deserves this.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.373
Charles:
Clarissa, what's happening?

31:49.375 --> 31:51.675
Why have we stopped?

31:51.677 --> 31:55.045
We're going to play a game.

31:55.047 --> 31:58.148
Gather all the rocks you
can and fill your pockets.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.416
The heavier the better.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.586
Then what?

32:03.955 --> 32:06.657
Then we're going to go swimming.

32:06.659 --> 32:09.092
But it's too cold.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.128
And I don't know how to swim.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.529
Just do it!

32:20.038 --> 32:21.538
What did we do?

32:21.540 --> 32:24.041
Are-are you angry with us?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.309
Mary:
Clarissa!

32:25.311 --> 32:30.147
Bash!

32:30.149 --> 32:31.481
(yells)

32:31.483 --> 32:33.517
Stay back!

32:33.519 --> 32:35.719
Don't come any closer!

32:35.721 --> 32:38.021
Clarissa, please,
you don't want to hurt charles.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.189
He's your friend.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.724
He's my brother.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.026
But I never knew.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.095
'cause she never told me.
She didn't want me.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.229
She hated me!

32:46.231 --> 32:48.198
No. She didn't.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.032
She just didn't know you.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.034
She hated my face.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.136
And they tried to fix it.
That's why I look like this.

32:53.138 --> 32:57.174
That's why I-I had to hide
my whole life.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.209
Mary:
It was a misunderstanding.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.244
A terrible misunderstanding.

33:01.246 --> 33:02.312
But it can end now.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.381
She tried to end it

33:04.383 --> 33:05.382
By getting rid of me.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.117
She took my family away.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.318
Well...

33:08.320 --> 33:10.988
Now I'm going
to do the same thing.

33:10.990 --> 33:14.157
Give me back little henry or...

33:14.159 --> 33:15.993
Or I'll cut charles!

33:15.995 --> 33:17.060
Clarissa, dear, listen to me.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.495
I'm your mother.
Stay back.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.763
You're not my mother.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.498
You told me you
wished I was...

33:21.500 --> 33:23.333
Dead.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.334
No, my dear.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.270
I <i>am</i> your mother.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.439
And do you know how I know?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.742
I see you now.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.610
Holding that knife.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.313
Willing to pay any price
for your convictions.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.148
It's the same thing I've done.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.649
More than once.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.485
To fight for my children.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.254
For what I knew
was mine.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.423
But look at
your mother now--

33:46.425 --> 33:49.092
Condemned to die.

33:50.661 --> 33:52.763
If you want the pain to stop,

33:52.765 --> 33:56.033
Learn from
your mother's mistakes.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.100
Choose a better way.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.536
Let yourself be loved.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.472
(crying):
No.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.508
No, no...

34:04.510 --> 34:06.109
Put down the knife, child.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.611
We can all be together,
all of us.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.146
Finally...

34:09.148 --> 34:10.614
(charles crying)

34:10.616 --> 34:12.115
...Your true family.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.216
(sobs)

34:13.218 --> 34:15.552
Mother! (screams)

34:15.554 --> 34:18.388
You monster! Let him go!

34:18.390 --> 34:20.190
You liar!

34:20.192 --> 34:21.758
You don't care about me!

34:21.760 --> 34:23.226
You never will.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.761
You-you want us
to be together?

34:24.763 --> 34:27.064
We'll be together
when we're all dead.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.065
No!

34:28.067 --> 34:29.800
(all yelling)

34:29.802 --> 34:31.201
Come! Oh!

34:31.203 --> 34:33.437
Oh! (kissing)

35:00.565 --> 35:02.099
Charles:
Clarissa's dead?

35:02.101 --> 35:03.533
Catherine:
Yes.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.368
And you were both so very brave.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.838
And I'm so very proud of you.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.339
(sighs)

35:09.341 --> 35:13.276
You'll have to let go
of them, majesty.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.112
It's time for you
to get back to the castle

35:15.114 --> 35:17.747
And your cell.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.716
Don't worry, my darlings.

35:21.252 --> 35:24.387
Mary will take good care of you.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.758
Make sure they have a hot bath

35:28.760 --> 35:29.860
When they get home.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.228
They're both blue with cold.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.331
Do you hear me?

35:34.333 --> 35:36.333
You were out of the tower

35:36.335 --> 35:38.335
Before you knew about them,
weren't you?

35:38.337 --> 35:41.872
You were free and clear.

35:41.874 --> 35:44.741
And yet you stayed for them.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.776
I may never see them again.

35:46.778 --> 35:50.580
Once the vatican sends word
that bash is legitimized,

35:50.582 --> 35:52.349
You two will be married.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.550
And I'll be dead.

35:53.552 --> 35:57.254
Probably that very day.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.421
I'm sorry.

36:00.224 --> 36:02.325
I wish I could've
found some other way

36:02.327 --> 36:04.494
To save francis's life.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.398
I believe you mean that.

36:11.235 --> 36:15.172
I owe all my sons' lives to you.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.440
If you hadn't finished
clarissa...

36:19.877 --> 36:20.877
You sent her
to a better place.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.812
This world
never suited her.

36:22.814 --> 36:26.850
And besides, she'll have her
mother with her soon enough.

36:40.498 --> 36:41.865
(knocking on door)

36:41.867 --> 36:43.667
How are the boys?

36:43.669 --> 36:45.202
Fast asleep.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.503
(door closes)

36:46.505 --> 36:47.804
Little henry was snoring

36:47.806 --> 36:49.339
Before the lord's
prayer was done.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.274
And charles wasn't
far behind.

36:51.276 --> 36:52.642
We're going to have
to give them

36:52.644 --> 36:54.311
A bit of extra attention
for a while,

36:54.313 --> 36:55.745
Especially when...

36:55.747 --> 36:57.447
Their mother is gone.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.249
I know.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.818
And extra security, too.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.787
Oh, you mean...
Yes.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.555
My brothers are staying.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.557
You were right.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.293
Out there, we have to rely on
others to look out for them.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.896
But here, we can both
keep an eye on them.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.299
But I shouldn't have spoken
to you the way I did.

37:16.301 --> 37:19.002
Giving you edicts,
questioning your actions.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.403
You did what had to.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.406
Without hesitation.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.909
So you're not angry with me

37:25.911 --> 37:27.577
For acting impulsively?

37:29.814 --> 37:32.682
Safe choices don't
always make us safe.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.352
I see that now.

37:35.354 --> 37:37.354
Which is why
I want you to marry me.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.456
Now. Today.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.292
I don't understand.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.462
We've been patiently waiting
for rome to give us permission

37:45.464 --> 37:46.596
To do what we want.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.365
We've been playing it safe.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.367
And what has that gotten us?

37:50.369 --> 37:53.436
Factions and plots
and uncertainty.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.306
Everything but safety.

37:56.308 --> 37:59.809
And what do we get
if we do get married now?

37:59.811 --> 38:01.778
We get what we want.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.780
We force their hand.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.449
If the pope wants
a catholic queen,

38:06.451 --> 38:09.419
One with the strength of France
behind her claim to England,

38:09.421 --> 38:11.621
He'll have to legitimize you.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.923
He'll have no choice.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.026
The pope always has a choice.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.394
You could be stuck
with a landless bastard

38:17.396 --> 38:18.762
For a husband.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.364
I'm willing
to take that risk.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.733
Bash...

38:23.735 --> 38:25.869
Marry me.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.406
No.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.707
Bash...

38:30.709 --> 38:32.442
That's not how it's done.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.677
This is how it's done.

38:35.413 --> 38:38.048
Marry me,
mary queen of scots.

38:38.050 --> 38:41.484
And make me
the luckiest bastard on earth.

38:43.521 --> 38:44.788
Yes.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.475
Well, I suppose this
is good-bye then.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.515
Good luck on your travels.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.551
And you, back at court.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.053
Don't remind me.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.022
Maurice: Headed back
to french court then?

39:19.024 --> 39:21.024
I mean you no trouble.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.994
Just wanted to ask
the lady a small favor.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.596
When the queen is led out

39:26.598 --> 39:28.698
To the executioner's block,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.500
Throw that at her for me.

39:30.502 --> 39:33.036
Tell her to try to buy
her way out of this one.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.437
What are you talking about?

39:34.439 --> 39:36.573
Oh, haven't you heard?

39:36.575 --> 39:37.841
There was a trial.
She was found

39:37.843 --> 39:39.476
Guilty of adultery.
It's treason.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.078
The king plans to behead her
within the week.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.546
And I, for one,
will welcome

39:43.548 --> 39:46.516
The end of her medici money
rotting France.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.786
Oh... Bring that coin back
with her blood on it,

39:49.788 --> 39:51.788
And I'll give you a fortune

39:51.790 --> 39:54.023
In house credit.
(laughs)

39:56.861 --> 39:57.961
Did you know of this?

39:57.963 --> 39:59.396
I had no idea.

39:59.398 --> 40:02.465
It can't be true.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.435
I had no intention
of ever returning

40:05.437 --> 40:06.770
To my father's court again.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.472
But if I don't...

40:09.474 --> 40:11.875
I'll be letting him
murder my mother.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.779
(wind whistling)
it's freezing.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.814
And it'll take us
hours to dig her a grave.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.416
So don't.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.950
There's no one
around to check us.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.719
Grab her feet.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.891
(man grunting)

40:35.966 --> 40:38.668
(man grunts)

40:53.517 --> 40:56.085
That's more
than this wretch deserves.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.520
Let's go.
