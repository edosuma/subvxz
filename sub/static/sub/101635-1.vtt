07:13.820 --> 07:15.701
I know a great place for a yoga studio.

07:15.767 --> 07:17.684
- A yoga studio, Aruba.

07:19.474 --> 07:21.206
You're full of ideas.

07:21.272 --> 07:22.377

07:44.591 --> 07:46.225
- [Rose] You're right,
it is another ghost town

07:46.291 --> 07:50.458
this time of year but it's
better than this place.

07:51.550 --> 07:53.954
- [Audrey] Good afternoon
guys, may I have a seat?

07:54.020 --> 07:55.020
- [Rose] Sure.

07:57.262 --> 08:00.136
- You guys don't look like
you're from around here.

08:00.202 --> 08:02.236
- [Benny] How can you tell?

08:02.302 --> 08:03.553
- Well you just didn't have kind

08:03.619 --> 08:06.286
of appropriate Florida clothing.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.356
- I'm an artist.

08:08.422 --> 08:11.908
- Well, I see like the foliage here.

08:11.974 --> 08:13.636
Are you kids staying hydrated?

08:13.702 --> 08:14.813
I've got water here.

08:14.879 --> 08:15.647
You want some water?

08:15.713 --> 08:17.212
- [Rose] No, that's okay.

08:19.727 --> 08:21.675
- [Audrey] A Friend of
mine has a perfume store,

08:21.741 --> 08:24.269
I would love to invite
you to get a perfume.

08:24.335 --> 08:27.438
- I think she's good, I think
she's got enough perfume.

08:28.738 --> 08:30.545
- A woman of today needs
to be independent honey.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.773
You know, that's the kind of
relationship that's a good one.

08:33.839 --> 08:34.839
- Thank you.

08:36.701 --> 08:38.568
(howling winds)

08:40.795 --> 08:43.173
- Actually I think we were
just leaving, actually.

08:43.239 --> 08:44.239
- Yeah.

08:44.928 --> 08:48.320
- [Audrey] Come and see
my orchid collection.

08:53.198 --> 08:57.147
- [Zoe] Honestly I don't know
when I want to go to Aruba.

08:57.213 --> 08:59.206
I think that I wanna
do some soul searching

08:59.272 --> 09:01.855
and I wanna take a little trip.

09:02.897 --> 09:05.442
- [Paul] Soul searching,
is that a yoga thing?

09:05.508 --> 09:07.940
This is some kind of bigger,
better deal thing right?

09:08.006 --> 09:09.930
The grass is always greener.

09:09.996 --> 09:13.363
Well it isn't, and where
are you going anyway?

09:13.429 --> 09:15.055
- I'm going to this place called Key Lime,

09:15.121 --> 09:16.391
it's a little town in the Keys.

09:16.457 --> 09:17.224
- [Paul] What?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.057
- [Zoe] Yes.

09:18.123 --> 09:18.891
And you're telling me that

09:18.957 --> 09:21.082
you're completely, completely happy?

09:21.148 --> 09:23.784
- You wanna walk away from all this?

09:23.850 --> 09:25.973
- I'm just a little bored

09:26.039 --> 09:27.612
and I'm a little tired of waiting for you.

09:27.678 --> 09:28.931
- There's someone else, isn't there?

09:28.997 --> 09:30.097
There's always someone else.

09:30.163 --> 09:31.613
- There's nobody else.

09:31.679 --> 09:32.697
You know me.

09:32.763 --> 09:33.531
- All right, so you're not going then.

09:33.597 --> 09:34.882
- No, I am going.

09:34.948 --> 09:36.643
Sorry that's what happens
when you don't pay attention

09:36.709 --> 09:38.842
to the person that you're with.

09:38.908 --> 09:39.988
- So this whole dinner is just

09:40.054 --> 09:42.721
like some kind of bullshit ruse?

09:47.170 --> 09:48.261
- You know I was gonna go tomorrow

09:48.327 --> 09:49.727
but I'm just gonna leave right now.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.227
Later you walk around.

19:14.293 --> 19:18.043
- [Zoe] I could use a
drink after that drive.

19:19.771 --> 19:23.605
(hypnotic music, rooster crowing)

19:46.061 --> 19:46.829
- [Paul] There is always someone else.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.697
- There is nobody else, stop it.

19:48.763 --> 19:51.687
- [Paul] that yoga instructor.

19:51.753 --> 19:53.228
- That is not true.

19:53.294 --> 19:56.211
Stop it, are you calling me a liar?

19:57.189 --> 19:58.599
You know me.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.433
- [Paul] All right so you're not going.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.738
- [Zoe] No, I am going.

I can bring you to Audrey.

21:27.149 --> 21:28.135

21:28.201 --> 21:31.615
- Audrey has a orchid farm, and she's...

21:31.681 --> 21:32.448
- An orchid farm?

21:32.514 --> 21:33.281
- An orchid farm, yeah.

21:33.347 --> 21:34.115
- I love orchids.

21:34.181 --> 21:35.751
- She breeds orchids.

21:35.817 --> 21:37.642
- So this orchid lady that you're telling

21:37.708 --> 21:39.862
me to see, Audrey is her name?

21:39.928 --> 21:40.696
- [Peter] Yeah, yeah.

21:40.762 --> 21:42.393
- And she has just orchids?

21:42.459 --> 21:43.976
What does she do, she sells them?

21:44.042 --> 21:46.213
- She has the most exquisite
orchids, she breeds.

21:46.279 --> 21:47.047
- Really?

21:47.113 --> 21:49.882
- she breeds with
different types of species.

21:49.948 --> 21:50.833
- Wow, well I'm really

21:50.899 --> 21:52.633
looking forward to seeing that.

21:52.699 --> 21:53.704
- She a dynamic woman.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.862
- It was really nice to meet you,

21:54.928 --> 21:57.208
I think I'm going back to my hotel.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.042

22:52.835 --> 22:53.602

22:53.668 --> 22:54.436

22:54.502 --> 22:55.811
- Hey, how you doing?

22:55.877 --> 22:56.907
- Oh, how are you babe?

22:56.973 --> 22:58.859
- What's going on?

22:58.925 --> 23:00.377
Everything looks beautiful here.

23:00.443 --> 23:02.530
- Look right here, like the white flowers

23:02.596 --> 23:06.321
are about to bloom this time of year.

23:06.387 --> 23:07.606
- [Peter] Insects?

23:07.672 --> 23:10.347
- They come and go in
different shades of color

23:10.413 --> 23:11.953
just like the rainbow.

23:12.019 --> 23:13.562
- [Peter] Yeah, I met this gal last night.

23:13.628 --> 23:14.396
- [Audrey] Oh yeah?

23:14.462 --> 23:18.029
- Over at the bar, she's from
Maryland, real pretty girl.

23:18.095 --> 23:20.242
Thought maybe you girls could connect,

23:20.308 --> 23:21.076
she would love it here.

23:21.142 --> 23:22.155
- Wow.

23:22.221 --> 23:23.040
Whats her name?

23:23.106 --> 23:23.874
- Zoe.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.263
- What time did you have in mind?

23:25.329 --> 23:26.883
- Maybe like four or five.

23:26.949 --> 23:28.854
Make sure this time she doesn't disappear.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.793
- What did you do to the last one?

23:30.859 --> 23:34.001
- I don't know, what did you do?

23:34.067 --> 23:36.415
- What do you think, I've
got her buried in a pot?

23:36.481 --> 23:37.481

23:38.597 --> 23:40.505

(Guitar Smashes)

24:16.579 --> 24:18.437
(Paul sighs)

24:33.981 --> 24:34.942
- [Peter] Watch out for the snakes.

24:35.008 --> 24:36.681
- [Zoe] Wow.

24:36.747 --> 24:38.830
- [Peter] lots of plants.

24:39.755 --> 24:42.670
(birds, insects chirping)

24:42.736 --> 24:44.019
- [Audrey] Check this out, this is a.

24:44.085 --> 24:44.853
- Wow

24:44.919 --> 24:46.861
I've never seen one of these before.

24:46.927 --> 24:50.443
- This is called Serepedulum
Elizabeth and Buckleberry.

24:50.509 --> 24:53.902
Or, Bulbophyllum Elizabeth
and Buckleberry actually.

24:53.968 --> 24:56.851
These orchids have a cantilever lip here.

24:56.917 --> 24:59.116
You see how this orchid moves inside here?

24:59.182 --> 25:00.182
- Yes.

25:01.672 --> 25:03.112
- Of course the orchids are trying

25:03.178 --> 25:05.252
to replicate another insect

25:05.318 --> 25:08.503
so that the insects
will have sex with them.

25:08.569 --> 25:09.785
- [Zoe] You're so knowledgeable,

25:09.851 --> 25:12.397
all of these orchids and plants.

25:12.463 --> 25:14.164
- Oh, we have more orchids here than

25:14.230 --> 25:16.115
any other state in the whole US.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.533
- I can see, I just
wish they were in bloom.

25:18.599 --> 25:19.763
- You've got to come back.

25:19.829 --> 25:21.941
- [Peter] Offer her some key
lime pie, you're famous for that.

25:22.007 --> 25:23.043
(Audrey laughs)

25:23.109 --> 25:25.731
- I make the best there is honey.

25:25.797 --> 25:27.832
- [Peter] Be careful though,
don't eat too much of it.

25:27.898 --> 25:29.734
- Oh, it's not too fattening.

25:29.800 --> 25:30.964
How long are you here for?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.499
- I was only gonna stay for three days,

25:32.565 --> 25:33.364
but maybe longer.

25:33.430 --> 25:35.022
- [Peter] All right, well
I think it's time Audrey.

25:35.088 --> 25:36.122
- [Zoe] I guess we're leaving.

25:36.188 --> 25:38.464
- [Peter] Small doses
is always good, yeah.

25:38.530 --> 25:41.304
- You wanna keep her to yourself Peter.

25:41.370 --> 25:42.973
Bye, nice meeting you.

25:43.039 --> 25:45.092
- Bye, see you soon.

25:45.158 --> 25:46.158
- Okay.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.279
- [Audrey] Zoe, Zoe.

25:50.237 --> 25:52.404

from home aren't we?

26:43.425 --> 26:44.193
- Little bit.

26:44.259 --> 26:45.321
- May I ask you what
brings you to Key Lime sir?

26:45.387 --> 26:46.600
- A little warm weather.

26:46.666 --> 26:48.009
- Oh it's hot down here.

26:48.075 --> 26:49.968
Let me get your license and registration.

26:50.034 --> 26:51.784
Nice and slow please.

26:53.242 --> 26:54.769
Keep those hands where I can see them.

26:54.835 --> 26:55.848
Step out of the car please.

26:55.914 --> 26:56.681
- Is there a problem officer?

26:56.747 --> 26:57.514
- Yeah, we'll see right now

26:57.580 --> 26:58.900
go ahead and step out of the car.

27:00.679 --> 27:02.343
- [Driver] I'm not
feeling too welcomed here.

27:02.409 --> 27:03.177
- [Det. Lopez] Move this way.

27:03.243 --> 27:05.655
Keep your hands on the car
and don't get cute with me.

27:05.721 --> 27:07.570
- [Driver] Why am I in trouble?

27:10.270 --> 27:13.103

28:22.720 --> 28:24.383

28:24.449 --> 28:25.917
- No I haven't heard a thing from her.

28:25.983 --> 28:28.527
So you haven't heard from her at all?

28:28.593 --> 28:31.810
That's where she was headed to Key Lime.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.390
You know, she got some idea in her head

28:33.456 --> 28:37.092
about going there and doing
this, and finding herself.

28:37.158 --> 28:37.926
You can look at it like that,

28:37.992 --> 28:40.093
but at the end of the day,
I gotta go and find her.

28:40.159 --> 28:41.810
You know, she's got to have
a space, yeah, yeah, yeah,

28:41.876 --> 28:43.789

28:43.855 --> 28:45.215
I know some people in the police station,

28:45.281 --> 28:46.882
I'm not going to cause a big fuss.

28:46.948 --> 28:48.702

right, let her find herself.

30:09.747 --> 30:11.176
How can I help you?

30:11.242 --> 30:12.474
- Thank you for calling.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.832
- [Paul] Yeah, we met at the
Gun Show in Miami last year.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.044
- Paul, with Baltimore P.D. yes of course,

30:17.110 --> 30:18.155
what can I do for you?

30:18.221 --> 30:21.227
- My girlfriend she took
off down to Key Lime,

30:21.293 --> 30:23.964
and I haven't heard from her at all.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.030
- Right.

30:26.091 --> 30:26.926
Okay.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.293
- You know, she's getting
into a couple of things,

30:28.359 --> 30:30.666
so I wasn't, you know, I
didn't want to be alarmist

30:30.732 --> 30:31.500
but now it's been a week

30:31.566 --> 30:33.455
and you know how these things are so.

30:33.521 --> 30:35.734

30:35.800 --> 30:37.090
"Zoe"

30:37.156 --> 30:38.798
[Lopez] Okay, so once
I receive her picture,

30:38.864 --> 30:40.300
I'll hand it out,

30:40.366 --> 30:41.764
and start asking some questions.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.562
Do you have any idea who
she came down here to see?

30:43.628 --> 30:46.052
- As far as I know, she
doesn't know anybody there.

30:46.118 --> 30:47.604
- Got it.

30:47.670 --> 30:50.182
- Thank you so much Detective
Lopez, I'll see you on Friday.

30:50.248 --> 30:51.016
- [Lopez] I'll have an officer come

30:51.082 --> 30:52.734

33:21.799 --> 33:22.981
- You don't know her?

33:23.047 --> 33:25.272
If you see her maybe you'll let me know?

33:25.338 --> 33:27.606

37:02.235 --> 37:03.306
- Detective Lax is
working with me on a case,

37:03.372 --> 37:04.586
he has a few questions
he'd like to ask you.

37:04.652 --> 37:05.652
- Sure.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.715
- I need to know if
you've seen this person.

37:09.781 --> 37:12.470
She's been missing for 10 days.

37:12.536 --> 37:15.085
- I saw her about a week
ago, we met at the bar.

37:15.151 --> 37:15.918

37:15.984 --> 37:16.793

37:16.859 --> 37:18.446

37:18.512 --> 37:19.564
- [Peter] I brought her to Audrey's,

37:19.630 --> 37:21.297
we went back to the bar.

37:23.881 --> 37:26.346
We talked about orchids and life.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.273
We made plans to meet with Audrey again.

37:28.339 --> 37:30.393
Never saw her again, typical girl.

37:30.459 --> 37:31.792
She stood me up.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.096
Yeah, we had some drinks, pretty hot.

37:35.162 --> 37:36.427
- [Det. Lopez] Peter, please
show a little respect.

37:36.493 --> 37:37.945
She might be in some trouble.

37:38.011 --> 37:39.326
- She didn't say anything
about a boyfriend.

37:39.392 --> 37:41.056
- That's a real person,
Audrey the orchid lady?

37:41.122 --> 37:41.890
- 100 percent.

37:41.956 --> 37:43.196
- [Det Lax] You might be the
last person to see her alive.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.208
You understand that you're
in serious shit here?

37:45.274 --> 37:46.227
- Stick to the facts guys.

37:46.293 --> 37:48.026
I got this detective. Peter.

37:48.092 --> 37:48.907
I want you to understand,

37:48.973 --> 37:50.485
I don't want you snooping
around her house or anything.

37:50.551 --> 37:51.318
Do you understand me?

37:51.384 --> 37:52.294
- [Peter] You sure she's missing?

37:52.360 --> 37:54.945
- [Det. Lopez] Let's go detective.

- Police chief, Officer Lopez
is the beer chugging champion?

39:37.081 --> 39:39.816
- Oh yeah, Detective Lopez is the champ.

39:41.008 --> 39:41.954
- Are you for real?

39:42.020 --> 39:43.020
- Yeah.

39:44.041 --> 39:46.620
- He's the guy that's
running your police force.

39:46.686 --> 39:49.502
He's the guy who's
running your police force.

39:49.568 --> 39:50.461
It doesn't bother you that

39:50.527 --> 39:55.084
he's the beer chugging
champion of the fucking?

39:55.150 --> 39:56.199
- Just get me the check.

39:56.265 --> 39:58.610
No, this is fucked up.

39:58.676 --> 40:00.653
Key Lime voodoo, you gotta go.

40:00.719 --> 40:01.986
- [Waiter] Here sir.

40:02.052 --> 40:04.576
(cafe chatter)

40:05.868 --> 40:06.635
You've seen her?

40:06.701 --> 40:07.469
- Oh yeah.

40:07.535 --> 40:08.964
- [Det. Lax] Where?

40:09.030 --> 40:11.322
- [Waiter] Down at
Peacock Park doing yoga.

40:11.388 --> 40:12.530
- [Det. Lax] When?

40:12.596 --> 40:14.380
- [waiter] A couple days ago.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.467
(Det. Lax grunts)

40:21.734 --> 40:23.526
(tense music)

40:29.927 --> 40:30.923
- Hello?

40:30.989 --> 40:34.273
- It's me Zoe, I was here
with Peter yesterday.

40:34.339 --> 40:36.410
- [Zoe] I think I really
want to stay here.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.775
- You sound like you
could be the type to stay.

40:38.841 --> 40:39.789
(dramatic chord)

40:39.855 --> 40:42.049
Yeah, Key Lime's the love of my life.

40:42.115 --> 40:43.090
- [Zoe] It seems like a world

40:43.156 --> 40:45.243
is just starting to open up for me.

40:45.309 --> 40:46.479
- Oh, I bet it is.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.825
So what are your plans
for the next few days?

40:48.891 --> 40:50.509
- I don't really have any plans.

40:50.575 --> 40:53.463
- I have some things that I
have to do this afternoon.

40:53.529 --> 40:56.345
So um, you know I can't sit here all day,

40:56.411 --> 40:58.374
I really like the fact that you came over,

40:58.440 --> 41:02.465
but how would you like to come
back on say, Saturday, maybe.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.295
- That's perfect for me.

41:07.693 --> 41:09.583
- Well, you have a great afternoon, okay?

41:09.649 --> 41:10.416
- Thanks, you too.

41:10.482 --> 41:11.249
- All right sweetie.

41:11.315 --> 41:12.082
- Bye.

41:12.148 --> 41:12.916
- Uh huh.

41:12.982 --> 41:15.622
(dramatic music)

41:15.688 --> 41:17.987
(hose spraying)

41:20.112 --> 41:21.912
(tractor engine rumbles)

41:23.898 --> 41:25.773
(tense music)

41:35.115 --> 41:37.632
- [Det. Lax] I'm looking for somebody,

41:37.698 --> 41:38.466
I'm wondering if you've seen them.

41:38.532 --> 41:40.181
- [Woman] Sorry, I haven't seen her.

41:40.247 --> 41:43.072
- [Det. Lax] Okay, all right
thank you, I appreciate it.

41:45.575 --> 41:46.891
- Hello?

41:46.957 --> 41:48.359
- Lopez, Lax.

41:48.425 --> 41:50.391
- Paul, how are you, what's going on.

41:50.457 --> 41:52.882
- I see you won the local Chuggernaut.

41:52.948 --> 41:54.597
You pick me up and tell
me that you got this.

41:54.663 --> 41:57.895
That if anybody can find her, you can.

41:57.961 --> 41:59.711
Bullshit, it's lie, after lie, after lie.

41:59.777 --> 42:00.682
Dead end after dead end.

42:00.748 --> 42:02.666
- Paul, absolutely no need for that Paul.

42:02.732 --> 42:04.251
- I'm taking over this investigation

42:04.317 --> 42:05.085
and when I'm done,

42:05.151 --> 42:07.330
I'm shutting down your fucking department.

42:07.396 --> 42:09.510
- Aren't you over reacting just a tad bit?

42:09.576 --> 42:11.350
- Then I go on to find
out there is missing girls

42:11.416 --> 42:12.920
and you're not even
paying attention to that.

42:12.986 --> 42:15.045
You should be 24-7 looking
for these missing girls.

42:15.111 --> 42:16.846
One of those missing girls is mine.

42:16.912 --> 42:18.898
- Where did you read this?

42:18.964 --> 42:21.240
- Jerk off, whatever the
fuck it is you got to do.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.105
- How about this Paul,
why don't you calm down

42:23.171 --> 42:24.440
and I'll come by and
see you in the morning

42:24.506 --> 42:25.888
and see what we can do.

42:25.954 --> 42:27.168
How does that sound?

42:27.234 --> 42:28.001
- Fucking idiot.

42:28.067 --> 42:28.834
- Okay, got it, no problem.

42:28.900 --> 42:29.900
Goodbye Paul.

42:31.575 --> 42:33.491
(suspenseful music)

42:35.325 --> 42:36.325
(twigs snapping)

42:42.425 --> 42:45.208
(Paul heavy breathing)

42:57.917 --> 42:59.942

43:10.730 --> 43:12.221

43:25.488 --> 43:26.488

43:39.952 --> 43:41.969
(ominous music)

43:55.475 --> 43:58.225
(bird squawking)

44:02.679 --> 44:04.096
- [Audrey] They are people.

44:05.405 --> 44:07.587
- [Audrey] Now don't bother
that lizard on the wall,

44:07.653 --> 44:09.675
he's my friend too.

44:09.741 --> 44:12.786
(tense music)

44:12.852 --> 44:15.352
- [Det. Lopez] Good afternoon, anyone home?

44:16.513 --> 44:17.513
- [Audrey] Hello,

44:18.480 --> 44:20.623
Oh Detective Lopez, come on in.

44:20.689 --> 44:21.813
- How you doing Audrey?

44:21.879 --> 44:23.314
Long time no see.

44:23.380 --> 44:24.276
Thank you.

44:24.342 --> 44:25.841
- Yeah, long time.

44:28.171 --> 44:29.188
- Figured I'd stop by

44:29.254 --> 44:31.391
and get some of your
world famous key lime pie.

44:31.457 --> 44:32.767
Hoping you could help me out.

44:32.833 --> 44:35.216
- [Audrey] If there's anything I can do.

44:35.282 --> 44:37.964
- You got a lot of boxes
here, going somewhere Audrey?

44:38.030 --> 44:40.156
- I'm just downsizing
before I have to cart

44:40.222 --> 44:42.876
all this stuff over to the women's club.

44:42.942 --> 44:44.004
- Is that so?

44:44.070 --> 44:45.430
- Well go ahead and have a look around.

44:45.496 --> 44:46.264
- I will.

44:46.330 --> 44:48.594
- Oh, let me know when you
want that key lime pie.

44:48.660 --> 44:49.461
(eerie music)

44:49.527 --> 44:51.678
So what brings you to the neighborhood?

44:51.744 --> 44:53.141
- I'm just looking for a friend.

44:53.207 --> 44:53.975
- Oh yeah?

44:54.041 --> 44:55.202
[Audrey]Oh a girl.

44:55.268 --> 44:56.505
- Maybe you've seen her?

44:56.571 --> 44:58.604
(suspenseful music)

45:00.836 --> 45:01.604
- No, I haven't.

45:01.670 --> 45:02.837
I can't say I have.

45:03.812 --> 45:04.579
- You sure?

45:04.645 --> 45:05.412
- Yeah.

45:05.478 --> 45:06.246
- Let me show you again.

45:06.312 --> 45:07.946
- No, I mean, I know pretty
much everybody in town,

45:08.012 --> 45:11.151
but you know, we have a lot of
people that come through, so.

45:11.217 --> 45:12.676
- [Lopez] Tell me more about
these orchids you have.

45:12.742 --> 45:14.289
Most orchids only bloom once right?

45:14.355 --> 45:15.555
- No.

45:15.621 --> 45:17.164
- You wanna look one more time?

45:17.230 --> 45:17.998
- [Audrey] You know what?

45:18.064 --> 45:19.724
I think Peter may have brought her around,

45:19.790 --> 45:21.497
he brings so many girls around.

45:21.563 --> 45:23.387
I couldn't really tell you for sure.

45:26.545 --> 45:28.287
(eerie music)

45:37.471 --> 45:40.166
(wind chime jingles)

45:40.232 --> 45:42.526
- [Paul] What kind of store is this?

45:42.592 --> 45:44.759
Let me ask you a question.

45:46.517 --> 45:48.735
Thought uou maybe have
seen this girl anywhere,

45:48.801 --> 45:52.102
walking around here in the last few days?

45:52.168 --> 45:53.585
- Never seen her.

45:55.201 --> 45:56.201
I'm so sorry.

45:59.282 --> 46:03.115
- Sir, may I ask you,
have you seen this girl?

46:08.380 --> 46:10.393
Ever heard of anybody called Audrey?

46:10.459 --> 46:13.519
Something to do with orchids.

46:15.927 --> 46:18.427
(eerie music)

46:26.450 --> 46:28.312
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

46:28.378 --> 46:30.878
(eerie music)

46:41.706 --> 46:43.772
- I'm sorry, I haven't seen her at all.

46:43.838 --> 46:45.505
(tense music)

46:48.341 --> 46:49.108
- [Det Lax] Good morning.

46:49.174 --> 46:49.942
- Good morning sir.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.646
- That's a missing person,
you've not seen her anywhere?

46:51.712 --> 46:52.479
- [Clerk] I don't know sir.

46:52.545 --> 46:53.312
- She's not been in the store,

46:53.378 --> 46:54.155
not seen her walking around the street?

46:54.221 --> 46:56.887
You ever heard of somebody called Audrey?

46:56.953 --> 46:58.728
- I'm trained to tell
when people are lying.

46:58.794 --> 47:00.294
- Sorry sir.

48:21.248 --> 48:22.521

48:22.587 --> 48:23.939
How are you brother, everything good?

48:24.005 --> 48:27.378
- So I know you told me not
to go by Audrey's house,

48:27.444 --> 48:30.356
but I have to tell you,
I went by there anyway

48:30.422 --> 48:33.514
as I come to the back, I
hear these crazy noises.

48:33.580 --> 48:35.644
- [Audrey] Immortal flower.

48:35.710 --> 48:37.259
- Coming from the greenhouse.

48:37.325 --> 48:39.064
So I peek in the window.

48:39.130 --> 48:40.345
Audrey's standing there,

48:40.411 --> 48:43.136
and she's over some
sort of female sculpture

48:47.341 --> 48:49.227
Yelling and screaming, voodoo.

48:49.293 --> 48:51.593
(Audrey screaming)

48:51.659 --> 48:53.863
Yelling all kinds of chants.

48:53.929 --> 48:55.542
(Audrey yells)

48:55.608 --> 48:59.751
It was very bizarre, so I got
out of there just in time.

48:59.817 --> 49:01.150
- Good, perfect.

49:03.790 --> 49:05.335
- It gets even better.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.172
I'm over at my buddy's house,

49:07.238 --> 49:09.307
Skip, you know my fisherman buddy?

49:09.373 --> 49:10.141
- Uh huh.

49:10.207 --> 49:12.169
- You know he's been in
the Keys his whole life.

49:12.235 --> 49:15.035
I mention Audrey's name, I
told him what's going on,

49:15.101 --> 49:16.712
and he said, listen, Audrey was born

49:16.778 --> 49:18.427
and raised in that house.

49:18.493 --> 49:22.165
Her grandmother had deep
connections to the spirit world

49:22.231 --> 49:24.826
and practiced Voodoo in that house

49:24.892 --> 49:27.323
where Audrey was born and raised.

49:27.389 --> 49:29.368
Yeah, this is disturbing,

49:29.434 --> 49:30.872
something strange is going on there.

49:30.938 --> 49:32.835
- Right, right.

49:32.901 --> 49:34.553
- That explains why she's a loner.

49:34.619 --> 49:35.387
- [Lopez] Right.

49:35.453 --> 49:36.605
- Yeah, exactly.

49:36.671 --> 49:38.044
Or she's a witch.

49:38.110 --> 49:39.509
- [Lopez] Yeah, well.

49:39.575 --> 49:40.471
- Listen last time I brought

49:40.537 --> 49:42.176
a girl there, she disappeared.

49:42.242 --> 49:43.742
And now this girl?

49:45.140 --> 49:46.598
She used me to bring girls there.

49:46.664 --> 49:48.658
- [Lopez] Listen Peter.

49:48.724 --> 49:50.706
- I bet you she knows where Zoe is.

49:50.772 --> 49:54.993
- As far as Zoe goes, this is
now an active investigation.

49:55.059 --> 49:56.926
So what that means is I can't have you

49:56.992 --> 50:00.440
or anybody for that matter,
running around asking questions.

50:00.506 --> 50:01.736
- She's probably a Gemini.

50:01.802 --> 50:03.140
You know how they are.

50:03.206 --> 50:05.508
They're split personalities,
you can't trust them.

50:05.574 --> 50:06.797
They go from one side to the next.

50:06.863 --> 50:08.194
- The last thing I need right now

50:08.260 --> 50:09.028
is for you to get bitten

50:09.094 --> 50:10.948
by one of these poisonous plants.

50:11.014 --> 50:14.452
- I'm going back there Lopez,
I promise you, never again.

50:14.518 --> 50:15.449
- We understand each other?

50:15.515 --> 50:16.646

51:04.932 --> 51:07.030
I did some yoga at the park the other day.

51:07.096 --> 51:08.863

51:08.929 --> 51:11.111
- Yeah, I like it here.

51:11.177 --> 51:13.745
- You must have a boyfriend.

51:13.811 --> 51:16.061
So what's the story with Peter?

51:16.127 --> 51:17.523

51:17.589 --> 51:19.609
I met him at the bar,
he wanted to hang out.

51:19.675 --> 51:21.591
We hung out, he introduced me to you.

51:21.657 --> 51:22.733

51:22.799 --> 51:24.716

Yeah, he's a cop, something tells me

51:42.030 --> 51:44.055
