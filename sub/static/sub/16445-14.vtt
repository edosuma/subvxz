00:00.547 --> 00:03.444
- Previously on Gotham...
- It's you. It's really you.

00:05.928 --> 00:08.795
Oh, no. Somebody help!

00:08.831 --> 00:10.063
Penguin.

00:10.099 --> 00:11.665
He killed the librarian.

00:11.700 --> 00:15.068
I don't want to kill him.
I want to destroy him.

00:15.104 --> 00:16.637
And you promised them Jerome.

00:16.672 --> 00:18.772
They want to see his face.

00:18.807 --> 00:20.741
Behold the Prophet!

00:20.776 --> 00:22.142
We are Jerome!

00:22.178 --> 00:23.243
You get the message?

00:23.312 --> 00:24.611
We don't work for you no more.

00:24.647 --> 00:26.113
I will gut you!

00:26.148 --> 00:28.982
- Then Nygma dies.
- They have Ed.

00:29.018 --> 00:30.784
When I was last, you know, alive,

00:30.819 --> 00:31.852
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

00:31.887 --> 00:33.520
Well, where is my face?

00:33.556 --> 00:36.023
What?

00:36.058 --> 00:37.090
Oswald.

00:37.126 --> 00:38.692
- Where are you?
- Kane Chemicals.

00:38.727 --> 00:40.794
Oswald, hurry. Please?

00:40.829 --> 00:43.864
Tonight, Gotham, there are no rules.

00:43.899 --> 00:47.334
And when morning comes,
you, too, shall be...

00:47.369 --> 00:49.937
reborn.

00:49.972 --> 00:51.939
He's at the power
plant across the river.

Get those freaks in the cages!

01:07.823 --> 01:08.822
We need to find Jerome.

01:10.226 --> 01:11.391
Hey, watch him!

01:11.427 --> 01:13.560
Let go of me!

01:13.596 --> 01:15.162
Grab him!

01:20.769 --> 01:22.069
What about you, huh?

01:22.104 --> 01:23.804
Do you know where
Jerome is? Where is he?!

01:23.839 --> 01:25.672
Where is he? Look around!

01:25.708 --> 01:27.608
He's everywhere!

01:27.643 --> 01:29.076
Incoming!

01:29.111 --> 01:30.310
Get down!

01:33.649 --> 01:35.549
Here.

01:35.584 --> 01:37.951
Tonight... Gotham...

01:37.987 --> 01:39.753
is awakened!

Remember, Ed's safety
is all that matters.

01:52.801 --> 01:56.837
Whoever took him will pay,
but only once Ed is back.

01:56.872 --> 01:58.672
Ed!

01:58.707 --> 02:00.774
Edward!

02:08.083 --> 02:09.583
Ed.

02:12.054 --> 02:14.254
Are you all right?

02:14.290 --> 02:15.722
Tell me you are all right.

02:15.758 --> 02:17.157
I'm fine, Oswald.

02:17.192 --> 02:19.126
Of course you are.

02:19.161 --> 02:23.030
Where are they? Who dared
to think they could lay

02:23.065 --> 02:25.032
- their hands on you!
- I'm alone.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.534
Oh, you escaped.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.303
You did. Didn't you, you rascal?

02:29.338 --> 02:31.905
Did you bring anyone else?

02:31.940 --> 02:34.007
What? Why? No, uh...

02:36.312 --> 02:39.146
Just wondering if I was
gonna have to reload.

02:39.181 --> 02:40.781
I don't understand.

02:40.816 --> 02:42.783
I know.

02:42.818 --> 02:45.052
That's been half the fun.

02:45.087 --> 02:47.888
I-I'm sorry. I... I...

02:47.923 --> 02:49.656
What is happening? I...

02:49.692 --> 02:51.058
You weren't kidnapped?

02:51.093 --> 02:53.093
Not unless you count
kidnapping yourself.

02:55.597 --> 02:57.397
Recognize it?

02:58.967 --> 03:00.133
Oh, why should you?

03:00.169 --> 03:01.768
I doubt you did the deed yourself.

03:01.804 --> 03:04.771
That car belonged to Isabella.

03:04.807 --> 03:07.307
Ed, whatever you've heard...

03:08.777 --> 03:10.644
I know it was you, Oswald.

03:12.147 --> 03:13.647
Isabella was my everything,

03:13.682 --> 03:15.082
and you took her from me.

03:15.117 --> 03:20.020
And now I've taken everything from you.

03:20.055 --> 03:22.522
Well, almost everything.

03:22.558 --> 03:25.192
You still have your life.

03:25.227 --> 03:29.129
But that ends tonight.

03:29.164 --> 03:31.131
Attention, all residents,

03:31.166 --> 03:33.166
stay off the streets.

03:33.202 --> 03:36.169
A curfew is in effect in Gotham City

03:36.205 --> 03:37.971
until further notice.

03:38.006 --> 03:41.641
Seems like judgment came to
Gotham earlier than expected.

03:41.677 --> 03:45.178
If the situation worsens,
we may be forced to step in.

03:47.983 --> 03:50.517
The city will bend
long before it breaks.

03:50.552 --> 03:52.853
Give the GCPD a chance.

03:52.888 --> 03:57.190
Your faith in him is touching.

03:57.226 --> 03:59.659
And possibly dangerous.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.667
We're getting reports of a
riot growing on the west side,

04:07.703 --> 04:09.803
as well as widespread looting uptown.

04:09.838 --> 04:12.239
Mobs of cult members have
taken over Anders Parks,

04:12.274 --> 04:14.207
Gotham Cathedral, the zoo.

04:14.243 --> 04:16.576
All right, concentrate
units on the west side.

04:16.612 --> 04:18.178
Make sure they're issued riot gear.

04:18.213 --> 04:20.814
- Any word on Jerome Valeska?
- Nothing yet.

04:22.084 --> 04:24.384
Let me know as soon as he's spotted.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.052
Right. Got it.

04:26.088 --> 04:27.854
Lights aren't coming
back tonight. Tomorrow,

04:27.890 --> 04:29.990
- if we're lucky.
- This thing just keeps getting bigger.

04:30.025 --> 04:32.426
It's not just the cult anymore.
Ordinary citizens are taking

04:32.461 --> 04:35.328
- Jerome's cue.
- Meanwhile, Cobblepot's MIA.

04:35.364 --> 04:37.764
You call down to city hall, and
literally no one's in charge.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.367
Although that might
actually be good news.

04:40.402 --> 04:42.002
We need to find Jerome. He's the symbol.

04:42.037 --> 04:43.570
If we can take him out,

04:43.605 --> 04:45.238
maybe we can limit this
to a single bad night.

04:45.274 --> 04:46.907
How the hell are we supposed
to find him out there?!

04:46.942 --> 04:48.508
The city's one giant Dumpster fire.

04:48.544 --> 04:50.877
Jerome said he wanted to
plunge the city into darkness

04:50.913 --> 04:52.712
so people could do
what they want, right?

04:52.748 --> 04:54.981
He's not one to miss out on
the fun, so what does he want?

04:55.017 --> 04:58.718
A puppy? How the hell should
I know? I didn't talk to him.

04:58.754 --> 05:00.554
No, but Lee did.

05:00.589 --> 05:02.189
Yes!

05:02.224 --> 05:04.558
But my father appeared to me.

05:05.961 --> 05:07.627
I saw him.

05:07.663 --> 05:09.729
No. You...

05:09.765 --> 05:12.466
saw a man that I met in Indian Hill

05:12.501 --> 05:15.368
that does killer impersonations.

05:15.404 --> 05:17.304
You see, Oswald...

05:17.339 --> 05:19.272
How do I put this?

05:19.308 --> 05:21.575
Ghosts aren't real!

05:21.610 --> 05:23.610
But my father's remains...

05:23.645 --> 05:25.946
You stole them from his grave?

05:25.981 --> 05:28.081
Yup.

05:28.116 --> 05:30.650
Don't worry. He's at peace now.

05:30.686 --> 05:32.285
I gently placed his remains

05:32.321 --> 05:35.155
inside a Dumpster behind
a Chinese restaurant.

05:37.626 --> 05:39.259
You were angry. I understand.

05:39.294 --> 05:42.562
I even forgive you, but-but
killing me is not the way.

05:42.598 --> 05:45.999
So you admit you killed Isabella?

05:46.034 --> 05:48.902
Fine. Is that what you want?

05:48.937 --> 05:50.937
- Yes!
- I confess.

05:50.973 --> 05:52.572
I had her killed.

05:52.608 --> 05:54.107
But guess what?

05:54.142 --> 05:58.011
You should thank me because we both know

05:58.046 --> 05:59.618
what would have happened if I hadn't.

05:59.631 --> 06:00.623
Yes!

06:00.726 --> 06:03.149
I could have lived a life
with the woman I loved.

06:03.185 --> 06:05.285
I could have been happy.

06:05.354 --> 06:06.953
No, Ed.

06:06.989 --> 06:09.155
You would have killed her.

06:11.393 --> 06:13.226
Just like you did the other one!

06:13.262 --> 06:15.128
You couldn't have helped it!

06:15.163 --> 06:18.632
And afterward, you would
have hated yourself!

06:18.667 --> 06:20.834
Well...

06:20.869 --> 06:22.769
we'll never know, will we?

06:22.804 --> 06:25.338
I did it for love.

06:27.676 --> 06:29.976
What?

06:30.012 --> 06:32.178
I did it because I love you.

06:32.214 --> 06:36.783
- You should know that.
- Shut up!

06:38.186 --> 06:40.220
Love is about sacrifice.

06:40.255 --> 06:42.155
It's about putting someone else's needs

06:42.190 --> 06:43.657
and happiness before your own.

06:43.692 --> 06:45.992
- Ed, please...
- 'Cause the truth is, Oswald,

06:46.028 --> 06:48.962
you would sacrifice anyone
to save your own neck.

06:49.031 --> 06:50.564
Even me.

06:50.599 --> 06:54.000
Now, if you'll look above us,

06:54.036 --> 06:56.903
you will see a cauldron
of highly corrosive acid,

06:56.939 --> 07:00.507
which is currently being
held in place by this chain.

07:02.744 --> 07:06.580
When the ice melts,
the chain comes loose,

07:06.615 --> 07:08.381
the vat of acid tips.

07:08.417 --> 07:09.849
You get the idea.

07:09.885 --> 07:11.751
Ed.

07:11.787 --> 07:13.687
Please. No, please.

07:13.722 --> 07:15.488
I can change.

07:15.524 --> 07:18.158
Say you're right. Say you're right. I...

07:18.193 --> 07:19.960
The fact that I love you proves that

07:19.995 --> 07:21.895
I can change. Just give me a chance.

07:21.930 --> 07:24.431
You know as well as I
that a man facing death

07:24.466 --> 07:25.832
will say anything to save his skin.

07:25.867 --> 07:28.001
And you won't change...

07:28.036 --> 07:30.937
because you can't.

07:30.973 --> 07:35.642
Now, I was going to have
you say hello to Isabella.

07:35.677 --> 07:37.844
But...

07:37.913 --> 07:40.080
I think you... are going...

07:40.115 --> 07:41.414
to a very different place.

07:41.450 --> 07:44.050
Good-bye, Oswald.

07:44.086 --> 07:46.453
Ed!

07:46.488 --> 07:48.955
Ed! Ed!

07:48.991 --> 07:51.424
Okay, I think that's about all I can do.

07:51.460 --> 07:52.792
Thanks.

07:52.828 --> 07:54.594
How's triage going?

07:54.630 --> 07:56.863
We have a lot of overflow
from Gotham General.

07:56.898 --> 07:58.598
What do you want?

07:58.634 --> 08:00.467
When Jerome woke up,
did he say anything?

08:00.502 --> 08:02.135
Just that he wanted his face back.

08:02.170 --> 08:04.037
No. I mean, anything that might indicate

08:04.072 --> 08:06.039
where he was going,
what he was planning.

08:06.074 --> 08:07.440
We were just playing catch-up.

08:07.476 --> 08:09.075
You know, about coming
back to life, the cult.

08:09.111 --> 08:10.710
He asked if you and I
were still together.

08:10.746 --> 08:12.779
I mentioned you killed my
husband on our wedding night,

08:12.814 --> 08:14.414
and he thought that was
hilarious, so that's something

08:14.449 --> 08:16.082
the two of you can bond
over when you find him.

08:19.855 --> 08:21.388
He didn't tell me his plan.

08:21.423 --> 08:23.456
He talked about Galavan,
the night he died,

08:23.492 --> 08:25.025
and then he mentioned...

08:25.060 --> 08:26.993
- What?
- Bruce.

08:27.029 --> 08:28.728
He said the last thing he remembers

08:28.764 --> 08:30.263
is that he was gonna kill Bruce Wayne.

08:30.298 --> 08:31.998
Call Alfred, tell him I'm on my way.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.870
I'll light these candles. Good lad.

08:36.905 --> 08:39.139
I'll nip downstairs and see
if there's any life left

08:39.174 --> 08:41.274
in that old generator.

08:44.312 --> 08:47.313
Who's calling at this hour?

08:57.325 --> 08:58.792
Alfred?

08:58.827 --> 09:00.293
Shh.

09:08.503 --> 09:11.438
Ooh!

09:15.844 --> 09:19.546
My, my. Hmm.

09:19.581 --> 09:21.548
Look how big you've gotten.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.703
Are you okay?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.071
I'll be fine, Master Bruce.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.839
I'll be fine.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.341
Nice place you got here.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.976
You rent?

09:38.044 --> 09:39.310
What do you want?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.346
Attitude.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.482
Teenagers. Am I right?

09:44.517 --> 09:46.784
Oh, I remember those days.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.721
So many exciting new emotions
floating through you.

09:49.756 --> 09:54.025
Wanting to kill everyone you saw. Aw.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.997
You. Give me.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.069
You know, I will never
understand rich people's tastes.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.671
It's worthless.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.373
My father found it at a flea market.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.008
I keep it for sentimental reasons.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.710
Nice try. Oh, it's got some heft to it.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.712
Expensive, I'm guessing.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.414
- Be such a shame if I...
- Oh! No, don't.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.516
Huh.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.587
Tougher than I figured.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.056
Anyway...

10:25.091 --> 10:28.259
Aah! Bloody hell! I
asked you what you want.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.994
Right. Sorry.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.597
The old noodle's still a
little al dente post-thaw.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.999
The reason I'm here
is I'm gonna kill you.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.702
Why?

10:37.737 --> 10:41.072
Well, it's the last thing
I remember wanting to do.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.875
It's been nagging at me since I woke up.

10:46.279 --> 10:50.248
The idea of slitting that pretty, pink

10:50.283 --> 10:52.150
throat of yours.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.185
Figure that'd clear the decks.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.620
What do you think, huh?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.690
I remember that night...

10:58.725 --> 11:00.591
When you took over the benefit.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.560
You were quite the showman.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.628
Thank you.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.029
Always nice to be appreciated.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.464
And you're just going to kill me here?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.767
That's kind of disappointing.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.576
What do you mean?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.078
After all the buildup...

11:20.113 --> 11:21.379
You coming back to life,

11:21.414 --> 11:23.047
turning off the lights in Gotham...

11:23.083 --> 11:26.250
Killing me here just
doesn't show a lot of...

11:26.286 --> 11:29.654
Flair? Hmm? Style?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.423
Panache? Hmm?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.425
Go on, boy. Spit it out.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.161
- I can take it.
- I'm Bruce Wayne.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.564
- I'm aware.
- I am the ruling elite.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.899
My company is the machine
that keeps the cogs

11:41.935 --> 11:44.302
- of Gotham running.
- Wow.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.504
Killing me should mean something!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.439
And you're telling me no
one's going to see it?

11:49.909 --> 11:53.611
You're saying I need an audience?

11:53.646 --> 11:55.113
Oh. Look,

11:55.148 --> 11:58.116
I know you're just trying to buy time

11:58.151 --> 12:00.685
so you can escape.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.354
But your point is still valid.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.622
Saddle up, boys!

12:04.691 --> 12:06.090
We're taking this show on the road!

12:06.126 --> 12:09.160
And I know just the spot.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.828
Come on. Uh-uh-uh.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.663
Not you, old chap.

12:12.699 --> 12:16.000
The prince of Gotham deserves
a public death. His butler,

12:16.035 --> 12:17.468
not so much. Kill him.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.369
- No!
- Bruce!

12:20.807 --> 12:23.708
This is what you've been training for.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.345
You're gonna be all right on your own.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.682
I will see you again.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.519
You carry on, son. You carry on.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.521
Strangely intimate.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.222
Come on.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.124
Try not to get any blood

12:40.160 --> 12:42.493
on the couch. I might
come back for that.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.395
Help!

12:44.430 --> 12:47.965
Somebody help me! Help!

12:54.107 --> 12:55.740
- Help!
- Hello?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.742
Over here!

12:59.245 --> 13:01.179
Oh, oh, thank God.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.481
There's not much time.
Cut me loose! Hurry!

13:03.516 --> 13:05.016
What's that car doing in here?

13:05.051 --> 13:06.317
It doesn't matter. Cut me loose.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.352
You-you look familiar.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.022
Yes. I'm... I happen to
be the mayor of Gotham.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.623
So free me,

13:12.659 --> 13:14.525
and I promise there will
be a handsome reward.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.027
Oh, it-it really is you,

13:16.062 --> 13:17.862
the mayor of Gotham in the flesh.

13:17.897 --> 13:21.032
Yes! Now stop standing there
and get me out of here.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.068
I don't... I don't
know. What did you do?

13:24.103 --> 13:27.171
What? Ah. I'm gonna die here
listening to this moron.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.007
- Just cut the ropes!
- Okay, okay! Okay.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.376
Oh, God.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.014
Hurry!

13:56.536 --> 13:59.537
Fine! Come on then. What
are you waiting for?

13:59.572 --> 14:02.440
- You in a rush to die, old man?
- Who's gonna kill him?

14:02.475 --> 14:03.708
- Who's gonna do it?
- I want to do it.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.309
- I'll do it.
- What?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.777
What, you three?

14:06.813 --> 14:08.279
You three left here to take out

14:08.314 --> 14:10.081
the rubbish, were you?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.549
You, Mr. Machine Gun, by the suit

14:11.584 --> 14:13.484
of armor, what, you're gonna
shoot me in the grill, are you?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.753
What about you with the
crowbar, by the sofa?

14:15.788 --> 14:17.154
Gonna cave in my skull?!

14:17.190 --> 14:20.091
And how 'bout you, Mr. Machete?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.592
Come on in, sunshine. Don't be shy.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.593
Your mother wasn't. Chop-chop.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.962
Who are you talking to, old man?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.063
Me!

14:45.852 --> 14:46.851
Where's Bruce?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.452
That lunatic Jerome took him.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.356
No, please. No.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.901
Dance!

15:39.072 --> 15:41.505
Get him! Squash her!

15:43.910 --> 15:45.810
Get the old lady. No, the fat guy.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.345
Put your back into it.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.215
Oh...

15:53.853 --> 15:56.921
Well, we're off to a good start.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.391
What do you say, Bruce?

16:00.426 --> 16:05.096
Want to have some fun
before the main event?

16:13.959 --> 16:16.359
Bullock's pulling messages
from the tip line.

16:16.395 --> 16:19.687
You said Bruce was able to convince Jerome
to kill him in front of an audience?

16:19.713 --> 16:21.932
Yeah, he was trying to buy
himself some more time.

16:21.967 --> 16:24.901
And I'd be proud if I
wasn't so bloody terrified.

16:24.937 --> 16:27.471
I see it's given way to bedlam again.

16:27.506 --> 16:29.573
Jerome's acolytes

16:29.608 --> 16:31.208
have occupied places all over town.

16:31.243 --> 16:33.443
So finding an audience
won't be the issue.

16:33.479 --> 16:34.711
Question is where.

16:34.746 --> 16:36.279
We got 'em.

16:36.315 --> 16:39.115
They're in Anders Park,
the cathedral, the zoo.

16:39.151 --> 16:42.018
They've taken over the Hillside
Conservatory, the courthouse,

16:42.054 --> 16:43.820
and the Boardwalk Circus.

16:43.856 --> 16:45.288
Jerome was raised in a circus.

16:45.324 --> 16:48.258
Have a strike force and all
available units meet us there.

16:48.293 --> 16:49.926
I'll put out the call
on the way. Let's roll.

16:58.136 --> 17:00.170
Got to be honest, Bruce,

17:00.205 --> 17:04.174
you don't make the
world's funniest clown.

17:04.209 --> 17:06.443
- But...
- Ooh.

17:06.478 --> 17:09.311
We can fix that.

17:15.887 --> 17:19.089
Aw, shut up, you big baby.

17:20.358 --> 17:22.692
Let's turn that frown...

17:22.728 --> 17:24.728
upside-down.

17:26.832 --> 17:30.200
Gabe! We have to find
Ed Nygma and kill him!

17:30.235 --> 17:32.736
Gabe, where...

17:32.771 --> 17:35.705
Your monkey's cleared out.

17:35.741 --> 17:38.074
And what's that you
were saying about Nygma?

17:38.110 --> 17:41.278
Looks like we're not the only
ones trying to kill that guy.

17:41.313 --> 17:42.746
Now, where is he?

17:42.781 --> 17:44.648
I'm sorry, what?

17:44.716 --> 17:46.316
Speak up.

17:46.351 --> 17:48.318
What are you doing in my house?

17:48.353 --> 17:50.153
Whatever we want.

17:50.188 --> 17:52.188
You're finished, Oswald.

17:52.224 --> 17:53.723
Now, where's Nygma?

17:53.759 --> 17:55.025
I don't know.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.294
Think.

17:57.329 --> 17:58.995
What?

17:59.031 --> 18:00.463
I said think.

18:00.499 --> 18:02.699
Oh, I heard you. I'm just
surprised you knew the word.

18:02.734 --> 18:05.886
Speaking of words, any last ones?

18:05.912 --> 18:08.907
Babs said not to kill
him until we have Nygma.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.407
I don't work for Barbara Kean.

18:12.277 --> 18:15.312
Stop pretending that you
are anything but muscle!

18:15.347 --> 18:17.581
Yes, you used to be someone in Gotham,

18:17.616 --> 18:20.083
but those days are past!

18:26.391 --> 18:27.724
Remember when I put a knife

18:27.759 --> 18:29.159
in your mom's back?

18:29.194 --> 18:31.194
That was awful, wasn't it?

18:31.229 --> 18:34.030
Her crying, bleeding out.

18:34.066 --> 18:37.334
You just holding her as she died.

18:37.369 --> 18:40.637
You never did anything about it.

18:40.672 --> 18:42.439
Yet.

18:42.474 --> 18:44.207
Nah.

18:44.242 --> 18:46.843
You had your chance to kill me.

18:46.878 --> 18:50.547
Stop turning us against each other.

18:53.752 --> 18:55.085
We're taking him with us.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.687
Oh, if you think I am
going anywhere with you...

19:01.426 --> 19:03.193
You realize you have to carry him now.

19:03.228 --> 19:06.296
Son of a bitch.

19:11.770 --> 19:14.404
Oh, I missed.

19:15.807 --> 19:17.774
Is there a plan for all of this madness?

19:17.809 --> 19:21.211
These people don't want a
plan... They want an excuse.

19:21.246 --> 19:25.315
The mother who dreams
of strangling her child.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.817
The husband who wants to stab his wife.

19:27.853 --> 19:31.287
All they want is someone to tell them...

19:31.323 --> 19:33.323
"Do it.

19:33.358 --> 19:36.993
Kill them. It doesn't matter."

19:37.029 --> 19:38.995
It doesn't.

19:39.031 --> 19:40.764
Ooh, I love this game!

19:40.799 --> 19:43.233
- One, please.
- You, sir.

19:43.268 --> 19:44.567
No, no, no, no.

19:44.603 --> 19:46.670
Please, no, no.

19:48.106 --> 19:49.339
You won't get away with it.

19:49.374 --> 19:50.840
I already did. Now shush.

19:50.876 --> 19:54.144
I need to concentrate.

19:54.179 --> 19:55.578
A few dozen brainwashed maniacs

19:55.614 --> 19:56.680
can't keep the city hostage forever.

19:56.715 --> 19:59.182
Well, duh.

20:00.652 --> 20:03.620
So what's the point?

20:03.655 --> 20:05.455
The point

20:05.490 --> 20:09.059
is that all these people
out here, looting, robbing,

20:09.094 --> 20:11.094
killing,

20:11.129 --> 20:14.431
they're the people who wash your car,

20:14.466 --> 20:17.267
who pour your coffee,
who take out your trash.

20:17.302 --> 20:20.704
And what happened the
moment the lights went out?

20:20.739 --> 20:23.473
They showed their true faces.

20:23.508 --> 20:26.676
They showed how quickly
they want to open up

20:26.712 --> 20:30.613
your rich boy veins and
bathe in your blue blood.

20:30.649 --> 20:32.649
That...

20:32.684 --> 20:33.650
is the point.

20:33.685 --> 20:35.852
That's not true.

20:35.887 --> 20:38.788
There are good people in Gotham.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.794
Like who?

20:44.830 --> 20:49.899
The sheep who lock their doors
and crawl under their beds?

20:49.935 --> 20:51.568
Face it, kid,

20:51.603 --> 20:54.637
Gotham has no heroes.

21:01.546 --> 21:03.580
- No, no, no.
- Hey.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.316
Foul!

21:06.351 --> 21:08.384
He pushed me. Did you see that?

21:08.420 --> 21:11.087
You want to kill someone,
let's get on with it. Come on!

21:11.123 --> 21:14.357
You're so boring, Bruce.

21:15.627 --> 21:16.526
No!

21:19.030 --> 21:21.231
Huh. Sorry.

21:21.266 --> 21:23.032
Yo.

21:25.403 --> 21:26.770
Ah.

21:34.746 --> 21:36.379
Did that hurt?

21:37.916 --> 21:40.517
Not much.

21:40.552 --> 21:43.086
You try.

21:52.397 --> 21:53.630
Stop.

21:53.665 --> 21:54.864
Stop.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.800
All right.

21:56.835 --> 21:59.569
Enough dilly-dally.

21:59.604 --> 22:01.204
To the main event.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.286
Where the hell is our backup?

22:16.321 --> 22:17.754
Still two minutes out.

22:17.789 --> 22:20.256
Most were waylaid by another
riot on the west side.

22:20.292 --> 22:21.591
Yeah, but we can't wait, mate.

22:21.626 --> 22:24.327
All right, so... we go in,

22:24.362 --> 22:25.795
find Bruce, get him to safety,

22:25.831 --> 22:28.131
then we go after Jerome.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.567
- Ready?
- Not really.

22:32.838 --> 22:33.970
Yeah, we all know why we're here!

22:34.005 --> 22:36.172
Here comes Jerome, everybody!

22:50.689 --> 22:53.656
Hear ye, hear ye, gather round.

22:53.692 --> 22:58.027
The show is about to... begin!

23:05.971 --> 23:08.304
Let me hear.

23:10.041 --> 23:11.774
Come on, now.

23:13.345 --> 23:15.645
Shut up!

23:17.349 --> 23:19.616
That's better.

23:21.019 --> 23:23.353
Well, I think we can all agree

23:23.388 --> 23:25.655
tonight was a rousing success.

23:26.892 --> 23:30.693
We brought this miserable
city to its knees.

23:33.732 --> 23:39.002
So, how to thank the best
darn cult of fanatics

23:39.037 --> 23:42.138
a messiah like myself
could ever hope for?

23:42.173 --> 23:43.673
I give you...

23:46.411 --> 23:47.844
Cue!

23:47.879 --> 23:50.113
Oh. Yeah. Yes, yes sir.

23:52.117 --> 23:56.452
I give you the climax
of our festivities.

23:56.488 --> 23:59.222
The billionaire prince of Gotham...

23:59.257 --> 24:02.725
Bruuuuce...

24:02.761 --> 24:06.062
Wayne!

24:11.036 --> 24:13.937
Well, so what do you say, Bruce?

24:13.972 --> 24:16.706
Shall we end the night with a bang?

24:16.741 --> 24:19.442
Or better yet... a boom?

24:33.725 --> 24:37.293
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...

24:45.730 --> 24:47.563
All right.

24:49.133 --> 24:51.400
What's next?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.974
Death by a thousand cuts, very poetic.

24:55.010 --> 24:56.509
I like that.

25:00.715 --> 25:01.648
Slice!

25:04.519 --> 25:06.419
Nailed it.

25:13.695 --> 25:15.061
All right, folks.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.496
This is very important.

25:16.531 --> 25:17.730
Whatever you do,

25:17.766 --> 25:19.666
please, definitely try this at home.

25:19.701 --> 25:22.969
Preferably on a family member.

25:24.506 --> 25:27.874
Giddyup. Whoo, doggie!

25:27.909 --> 25:29.275
Yee-haw!

25:34.549 --> 25:35.949
You ready, partner?

25:35.984 --> 25:37.217
Oh, good Lord.

25:37.252 --> 25:38.918
Strike force just arrived.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.353
They're coming in.

25:46.928 --> 25:49.862
Detective Gordon, you're just
in time for the big finish.

25:49.898 --> 25:51.264
Nobody move!

26:57.499 --> 27:00.233
Find him.

27:00.268 --> 27:02.702
I'll find Jerome.

27:07.642 --> 27:09.776
So...

27:09.811 --> 27:12.178
here we are.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.248
I suppose I underestimated you, Barbara.

27:15.283 --> 27:16.816
It's the curse of great beauty.

27:16.851 --> 27:18.418
How did it go?

27:18.453 --> 27:21.287
You put together what
happened to Ed's librarian,

27:21.323 --> 27:22.789
turned him against me.

27:22.824 --> 27:25.425
Honestly, wasn't too hard.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.593
And then, together, you hatched a plan

27:27.629 --> 27:30.930
to destroy everything
I made and kill me?

27:30.965 --> 27:32.465
Pretty much.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.133
And brother,

27:34.169 --> 27:36.436
did you ever take the bait.

27:39.341 --> 27:43.209
Well, I hope you're happy
at the head of the table.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.678
You know, the table is
more or less littered

27:45.714 --> 27:47.213
with dead old dudes,

27:47.248 --> 27:50.016
but, hey, it's a place to grow.

27:50.051 --> 27:53.152
And now you got what you want,
you don't need Ed anymore.

27:53.188 --> 27:54.520
Uh-uh.

27:56.157 --> 27:59.058
My, my, it didn't take you
long to turn on each other.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.860
You know, I think of it

28:00.895 --> 28:04.330
as a limited partnership
that needs dissolving.

28:04.366 --> 28:08.534
So... I help you find Ed...

28:08.570 --> 28:10.470
Hmm. Things go better for me?

28:10.505 --> 28:14.006
I don't... you kill me?

28:15.377 --> 28:17.043
That about it?

28:17.078 --> 28:19.045
Yeah.

28:24.552 --> 28:26.052
Oh, Bruce?

28:26.087 --> 28:28.855
Where are you, boy?

28:28.890 --> 28:30.490
Come on out, boy.

28:30.525 --> 28:32.658
I won't hurt ya.

28:36.564 --> 28:39.165
Bruce, darling.

28:44.406 --> 28:46.939
Oh, Brucie...

28:59.154 --> 29:01.387
You ruined my show, Bruce.

29:01.423 --> 29:04.957
Hiding is just gonna make things worse.

29:07.629 --> 29:10.263
I didn't come here to hide.

29:11.466 --> 29:12.932
I wanted you to follow me.

29:17.539 --> 29:20.440
You're going to pay
for what you've done.

29:29.427 --> 29:32.094
You're going to call Ed,
tell him you're alive,

29:32.129 --> 29:33.996
tell him... Oh, I don't care.

29:34.031 --> 29:35.598
But find out where he is.

29:35.633 --> 29:37.933
- Why don't you call him?
- Because he's not stupid.

29:37.969 --> 29:40.402
He knows that now you're no longer

29:40.438 --> 29:43.239
the head of the underworld
or anything else,

29:43.274 --> 29:44.940
we don't need him anymore.

29:44.976 --> 29:46.809
It is our time to rule.

29:48.613 --> 29:51.080
You understand if I feel
compelled to refuse?

29:51.115 --> 29:53.249
Give me five minutes.

29:53.284 --> 29:55.884
- He won't refuse.
- I'd do it in three.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.947
Why you got to do that? What?

29:57.972 --> 30:00.289
- Cut me down like that in front of people.
- I'm just saying...

30:00.324 --> 30:02.291
Will the two of you shut up?!

30:03.794 --> 30:07.329
Give up Nygma, save your own ass.

30:07.365 --> 30:10.165
Live to love another day. Hey?

30:15.439 --> 30:17.306
Wow.

30:17.341 --> 30:18.807
What's going on?

30:18.843 --> 30:20.609
You have a weird look on your face.

30:20.645 --> 30:23.012
Like, weirder than normal.

30:23.047 --> 30:24.980
You're right.

30:25.016 --> 30:27.449
I should want him dead.

30:27.485 --> 30:30.286
"Should"?

30:30.354 --> 30:32.454
Oswald...

30:32.490 --> 30:35.891
you loved him, and he betrayed you.

30:35.926 --> 30:38.594
Actually, I don't know that I did.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.596
Love him.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.698
- Not really.
- What?

30:42.767 --> 30:44.466
Ed was right.

30:44.502 --> 30:47.002
I thought I loved him...

30:48.873 --> 30:53.208
because he saw me as no
one had since my mother.

30:53.244 --> 30:54.576
But I killed Isabelle...

30:54.612 --> 30:56.478
I'm pretty sure her name is Isabella,

30:56.547 --> 30:58.947
but go on.

31:01.452 --> 31:04.887
Because I wouldn't share him.

31:04.922 --> 31:07.523
Ed said love is sacrifice.

31:07.558 --> 31:11.126
I should have been able to
sacrifice my happiness for his.

31:13.931 --> 31:15.531
I couldn't.

31:17.935 --> 31:20.202
But I'm ready now.

31:22.273 --> 31:24.506
I won't... call... Ed.

31:24.542 --> 31:27.509
I won't let you hurt him!

31:27.545 --> 31:30.512
So you'd rather die than give up
the man who tried to kill you?

31:30.548 --> 31:33.082
I would!

31:33.117 --> 31:34.683
Isn't that crazy?

31:34.719 --> 31:37.286
Yes.

31:37.321 --> 31:39.955
It is.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.557
Guess you're not as smart
as you thought you were.

31:41.592 --> 31:42.991
He didn't give you up after all.

31:46.697 --> 31:48.564
You're in this together.

31:50.534 --> 31:51.934
- But why?
- Because

31:51.969 --> 31:53.602
I didn't want to just take what

31:53.637 --> 31:55.237
you had.

31:55.272 --> 31:57.172
I wanted to take what you believed.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.041
I wanted you

31:59.076 --> 32:01.443
to die...

32:01.479 --> 32:04.913
knowing that you were incapable
of loving another person.

32:06.217 --> 32:08.016
But I can.

32:09.453 --> 32:11.053
I just proved that, right?

32:12.390 --> 32:14.723
Now does that mean I passed?

32:16.227 --> 32:18.360
- Ed?
- I...

32:20.431 --> 32:22.598
don't know what it means.

32:38.849 --> 32:41.216
I have to tell you...

32:41.252 --> 32:43.585
this is way more fun

32:43.621 --> 32:45.654
than I was expecting.

32:51.729 --> 32:54.563
We make a good team, you and me.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.565
You killed Alfred.

32:58.436 --> 33:00.402
Is that what this is about?

33:00.438 --> 33:02.137
Yeesh.

33:02.173 --> 33:03.806
Are all rich kids this close

33:03.841 --> 33:05.974
with their butlers?

33:06.010 --> 33:07.075
Oh!

33:08.679 --> 33:10.279
This is about doing what's right.

33:10.314 --> 33:12.247
You want to be a hero!

33:12.283 --> 33:14.950
Tell you what, buddy...

33:14.985 --> 33:16.952
I'll give you a fighting chance.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.123
Let's do this mano y mano,

33:21.158 --> 33:23.926
my little conquistador.

33:23.961 --> 33:26.595
Come on.

33:28.199 --> 33:30.199
What kind of hero tackles
someone from behind?

33:49.420 --> 33:50.953
Let it out!

33:50.988 --> 33:52.321
That's it.

33:52.356 --> 33:54.323
That's it.

33:54.358 --> 33:56.358
That's it.

33:56.393 --> 33:57.793
Let it out.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.686
Do it.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.525
Aah!

34:59.356 --> 35:01.423
Alfred!

35:04.628 --> 35:06.962
Bruce!

35:11.468 --> 35:13.468
I thought you were dead.

35:13.504 --> 35:15.804
Can't get rid of me that
easily, can you, mate?

35:18.776 --> 35:20.842
Oh, come here.

35:29.687 --> 35:31.386
Behind you!

35:40.965 --> 35:42.297
Ow.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.972
Word of Jerome's arrest
is spreading quick.

36:00.023 --> 36:01.590
Streets are already quieter.

36:01.625 --> 36:03.224
Soon as the docs reattach his face,

36:03.260 --> 36:04.926
he's off to Arkham.

36:04.962 --> 36:06.595
You wish I would've shot him?

36:06.630 --> 36:08.029
Eh, he'd probably just

36:08.065 --> 36:10.231
- come back from the dead again.
- Probably.

36:10.267 --> 36:12.434
At least you get to say you
punched a man's face off.

36:12.469 --> 36:13.768
That's something, right?

36:16.673 --> 36:18.039
Jim?

36:18.075 --> 36:19.040
Sorry, what?

36:19.076 --> 36:20.742
Come on.

36:20.777 --> 36:22.444
Let me buy you breakfast.

36:28.852 --> 36:31.686
Well, got to say...

36:31.722 --> 36:34.089
the clown makeup was way more terrifying

36:34.124 --> 36:36.591
than the damage
underneath, Master Bruce.

36:38.629 --> 36:41.463
Did I ever tell you that
I don't like clowns?

36:43.433 --> 36:45.400
Well...

36:45.469 --> 36:48.036
in a couple of days,

36:48.071 --> 36:50.038
you'll be back to your old self.

36:50.073 --> 36:52.240
I guarantee it.

36:52.275 --> 36:54.209
You ready to tell me what happened?

36:56.913 --> 37:00.715
When Jerome took me away...

37:00.751 --> 37:03.218
I thought they were going to kill you.

37:04.621 --> 37:06.588
Shall I tell you what I thought?

37:10.460 --> 37:13.261
I thought how proud I was of you.

37:13.296 --> 37:15.263
Of the man that you've become.

37:17.801 --> 37:20.335
I almost killed him, Alfred.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.237
Ah, but you didn't, now, did you?

37:22.272 --> 37:24.239
You controlled your anger.

37:27.511 --> 37:31.079
It wasn't just anger.

37:31.114 --> 37:33.581
After everything Jerome had done,

37:33.617 --> 37:35.550
after all the pain

37:35.585 --> 37:37.919
he caused,

37:37.954 --> 37:41.656
the idea of killing him felt...

37:41.692 --> 37:43.958
It felt right.

37:46.129 --> 37:49.097
Yes.

37:49.132 --> 37:51.099
It felt like justice.

37:51.134 --> 37:53.468
There's a very fine line, Master Bruce,

37:53.503 --> 37:55.470
between justice...

37:55.505 --> 37:56.971
and vengeance.

37:57.007 --> 37:59.674
I know.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.010
But that doesn't mean there isn't one.

38:02.045 --> 38:03.645
No, it doesn't.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.880
I knew where the line
was tonight, Alfred.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.315
I didn't cross it.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.888
Well, that's the first rule.

38:13.924 --> 38:16.191
What do you mean?

38:16.226 --> 38:18.827
Well, I started training you
so you could defend yourself.

38:18.862 --> 38:21.830
Well, we're well past that, aren't we?

38:21.865 --> 38:24.899
But what's all this training for?

38:24.935 --> 38:26.901
What are you gonna do with it?

38:29.740 --> 38:31.206
I don't know.

38:31.241 --> 38:32.707
Nor do I.

38:32.743 --> 38:35.343
But if you keep going,

38:35.378 --> 38:37.345
you're gonna need rules.

38:39.216 --> 38:41.182
Rules that you cannot

38:41.218 --> 38:43.351
and you will not break,

38:43.386 --> 38:45.720
never mind what the reason,

38:45.756 --> 38:48.723
never mind what the circumstance.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.759
I will not kill.

38:56.032 --> 38:57.999
Say it again.

39:01.204 --> 39:03.171
I will not kill.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.910
Then let's get to work.

39:28.765 --> 39:30.732
Tonight was close.

39:35.505 --> 39:37.472
We could have lost Gotham for good.

39:38.775 --> 39:41.709
Soon, we will act,

39:41.745 --> 39:43.745
and you will be called upon.

39:45.715 --> 39:49.083
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

39:49.119 --> 39:51.119
Are you prepared?

39:51.154 --> 39:54.088
Yes. But I still don't understand

39:54.124 --> 39:56.090
how I can help save Gotham.

39:56.126 --> 39:58.092
Never fear.

39:58.128 --> 40:00.061
You are only part of the plan.

40:00.096 --> 40:03.731
Are you sure about this?

40:03.767 --> 40:05.433
You know what must happen

40:05.468 --> 40:07.001
if he refuses.

40:07.037 --> 40:09.003
I know.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.005
No one refuses the Court.

40:46.743 --> 40:48.710
- Uncle Frank?
- Hello, Jim.

40:48.745 --> 40:50.712
It's been a long time.

40:53.850 --> 40:57.552
Ed... I love you.

40:57.587 --> 41:00.355
I know you believe that now.

41:00.390 --> 41:03.191
So you need to listen
to me when I tell you

41:03.226 --> 41:06.895
by doing this... it will change you.

41:06.930 --> 41:08.529
I've killed before, Oswald.

41:08.598 --> 41:10.965
Not like this.

41:11.001 --> 41:13.167
This won't be a crime of passion

41:13.203 --> 41:15.837
or self-preservation.

41:15.872 --> 41:18.172
This will be the cold-blooded murder

41:18.208 --> 41:19.974
of someone you love.

41:20.010 --> 41:23.645
I don't love you.

41:28.418 --> 41:30.685
You need me, Edward Nygma.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.720
Just as I need you.

41:32.756 --> 41:35.156
You cannot have one without the other.

41:35.191 --> 41:38.059
You killed Isabella.

41:38.094 --> 41:39.093
The point is...

41:39.129 --> 41:41.562
That is the point!

41:41.598 --> 41:44.232
You can't talk your way
out of this, Oswald.

41:44.267 --> 41:46.200
I have wanted you to suffer

41:46.236 --> 41:47.835
as I've suffered.

41:47.871 --> 41:49.671
You killed her,

41:49.706 --> 41:52.006
so you die.

41:53.643 --> 41:55.610
When I met you

41:55.645 --> 41:57.612
you were a nervous,

41:57.647 --> 41:59.614
jittery loser.

42:00.917 --> 42:03.117
You were nothing.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.753
I created Edward Nygma.

42:05.789 --> 42:08.222
And I am the only one in the world

42:08.258 --> 42:10.892
who truly sees you as you are.

42:12.595 --> 42:16.364
Who you can still become.

42:18.068 --> 42:20.802
You can't do this.

42:24.307 --> 42:27.241
Ed, are you listening to me?

42:27.277 --> 42:28.743
I'm listening.

42:30.680 --> 42:33.414
Say something.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.787
I loved her, Oswald.

42:41.658 --> 42:43.925
And you killed her.
