Can you believe this morning
we watched the sun rise
on Earth

00:11.637 --> 00:13.923
and tonight we'll watch
Saturn set on Titan?

00:14.097 --> 00:18.511

come along? I mean we can
probably share my bio pod.

move in together.

What are you doing here?

01:37.347 --> 01:38.848
No time. We're in an

Wait, wait, wait,
what? What?

01:41.143 --> 01:42.974

should have engaged.

with the launch.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.380
Jack tried to stop it
but he couldn't.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.258
So you ended up
on Titan after all.
Yay.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.839
Not a consolation, Holly.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.508
What did you do?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.135
Zane!

15:36.310 --> 15:38.562
His pulse is weak!
Zane! Zane, can you hear me?

15:38.729 --> 15:41.061
The shock sent
his heart into v-fib.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.939
Zane! Zane,
can you hear me?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.483
We're losing him.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.111
Zane, can you hear me?

15:56.539 --> 15:57.949
Zane, can you hear me?

15:58.708 --> 16:00.118
Zane?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.456
Hey, buddy,
you gave us
a bit of a scare.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.544
At ease, girls,
please take Mr. Donovan
to the infirmary.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.834
Yes, sir.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.926
Boy, only a few hours
and already finding
trouble, you scamps.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.011
The Martha drones fired
on unarmed civilians.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.221
Miss Lupo provoked them.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.102
Nah, it's unlikely.
The Marthas
and l are networked.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.013
Got the old incident report
right here, Sheriff.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.602
Why don't you try
talking to the people

16:25.776 --> 16:27.516
who actually saw
what happened
and not the machines?

16:27.695 --> 16:28.650
Well, Allison, that...

16:28.821 --> 16:31.813
Human perception
is inherently flawed,
Dr. Blake.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.650
The eyewitness accounts
of Al. individuals
are far more reliable.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.238
Daddy, what's wrong?

16:37.413 --> 16:42.203
Oh, nothing's wrong, sweetie.
Everything's fine.
We're just sorting things out.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.743
That's right.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.755
Sheriff, why don't you
take her home,
so she can get some rest?

16:49.926 --> 16:53.544
I'm sure she would like
to spend some time
with her daughter.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.428
Yeah, what about Jo?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.428
Well, people's emotions
are running high with
the return of the crew.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.345
| see no need
to press charges.
For now.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.104
Thanks.
What is that?

17:10.029 --> 17:10.939
Let's go.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.112
Trust me,
you are going to
love working here.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.748
So, you ready
to meet your new
team leader? Please...

17:27.630 --> 17:28.710
Oh, no.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.830
Oh, yes.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.968
HOLLY: lsaac?

17:33.135 --> 17:36.423
Holly, you have
not aged a day.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.220
I haven't, actually.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.098
Dr. Fargo,
let me be the first to say

17:41.269 --> 17:44.181
how thrilled I am
to have you back.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.186
Oh, please, you hate me.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.564
You wanted my job
and my girl and you lost.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.690
I'd say,
this more than
makes up for that.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.611
The worm has turned.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.987
I'm out of here.
Time out, folks.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.990
Dr. Parrish.
Yes.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.745
I expect you to work
collaboratively

18:03.916 --> 18:05.998
with Dr. Fargo
and Dr. Marten...

18:06.168 --> 18:07.669
But...
No buts.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.630
But...
I want you to adjust
your attitude, mister.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.552
Things aren't what they seem.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.138
You're not safe here. Well...

18:27.106 --> 18:29.939
No one is.
And ifthey
find this place,

18:30.651 --> 18:32.266
they'll come for us.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.855
I don't understand.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.235
They're watching us,
but we're watching them.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.775
Them?
The D.O.D.,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.410
Senator Wen, the Andys.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.695
They called off
the search, Grace.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.580
They made an example of me,
so that they could take over.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.582
But you're back now.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.869
And you can help fix this.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.050
This is my house.
It's underground.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.505
Oh, sorry, laundry day.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.889
I know. I used to
live here, too.
Or I was about to.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.645
So since when is
the front door manual?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.352
Ah, since my
smart house got dumb.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.902
Thank you, sweetie.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.486
Want to see my room?
Yes, I would love to.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.774
And then bed,
teeth, jammies.
You know the drill.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.737
Can you read me
a book tonight?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.903
There is nothing that would
make me happier.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.446
I'll be there in a second.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.579
Wow. Looks like
someone missed you.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.291
She's gotten so big.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.592
She has already
lost her first teeth,

19:40.763 --> 19:44.472
and Kevin, he sounded like
a grown man on the phone.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.932
Finals week at Harvard?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.348
l blinked
and everything changed.

19:51.732 --> 19:55.190
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,
the terrible twos

19:55.361 --> 19:56.771
lasted until she was five.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.604
Which was brutal.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.107
Thank you.
For what?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.069
For taking care of my kids.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.212
"'Who are you?‘
said the caterpillar.

20:24.390 --> 20:28.053
"This was not an encouraging
opening for a conversation.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.218
"Alice replied,
rather shyly,

20:30.396 --> 20:32.557
"'l... I hardly know, sir.'

20:32.732 --> 20:35.098
"'Just at present.
At least I know who I was

20:35.276 --> 20:36.607
"'when I got up
this morning,

20:36.777 --> 20:40.770
"'but I think
I must have been changed
several times since then.'"

20:42.241 --> 20:43.902
Yeah, I know how she feels.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.159
Good night, darling girl.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.661
Wait,

21:00.843 --> 21:02.253
this is for you.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.344
Now we're all here.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.513
Good night.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.104
Hi.
Where's Allison?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.439
Uh, she's putting
Jenna down.
Okay.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.979
How's Zane?

21:23.991 --> 21:25.856
He'll be okay.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.072
ljust, I can't believe
that they're all back.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.829
Mmm.
Did you tell him?

21:33.501 --> 21:36.709
I tried. ljust...
l, I couldn't.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.211
I couldn't tell her, either.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.757
We can't keep this
a secret, Jack.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.715
Everyone knows, and...
l, yeah, but not tonight.

21:48.182 --> 21:51.094
It's just too much. Okay?

21:52.269 --> 21:55.682
Yeah. So I'm going
to stay at a friend's.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.768
'Cause this is all
just too weird.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.018
Better get you
some clothes, then.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.695
Sorry, it was
my turn to fold.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.567
There you go.
Thanks.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.509
CARTER:
We'll get through this.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.053
JO: Yeah.
Come on.
I'll walk you out.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.634
All right.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.616
How are you feeling?
Excellent. Never better.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.700
Glad to hear it.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.612
Yeah, so if you could just
hand me my clothes,

22:54.790 --> 22:56.371
I've got four years
to catch up on.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.454
Right after we do
some final brain scans.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.918
Andy's orders.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.750
Yeah, I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.334
Brain's feeling pretty good.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.626
Trust me, you'll feel
even better
once we're done.

23:14.101 --> 23:17.093
Okay, I think
we're all set to go.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.429
Morning.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.101
I went to check on you
and Jenna last night,

23:25.279 --> 23:27.190
but you guys
were both fast asleep.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.106
Well, I guess F.T.L. travel
really takes it out of you.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.117
Yeah, yeah.
I made coffee.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.199
Not as good as
SARAH's, but I try.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.086
| see a lot of things
have changed since I left.

23:45.257 --> 23:49.216
Yeah. Yeah,
it's going to take
some time to get adjusted.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.679
I saw you and Jo last night.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.812
Sorry.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.440
You were gone
for four years, Allie.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.947
It was Jo who
pulled me back.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.748
It was Jo who helped me
with the kids, Jo helped me...

24:23.045 --> 24:28.210
And, um, it evolved.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.422
Guess it would
make sense that it was Jo.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.608
Are you in love
with her?

25:05.671 --> 25:06.877
(KNOCKING ON THE DOOR)

25:11.885 --> 25:13.591
Morning, Sheriff.
Morning.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.377
Dr. Blake,
how are you feeling?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.298
I've been better.
Ah.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.184
I know this must be
a very difficult
adjustment for you.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.517
We do have people to talk to.
I encourage you to use them.

25:26.108 --> 25:29.066
By the way,
has Mr. Donovan
contacted you?

25:31.155 --> 25:32.144
No.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.029
Well, if he does,
please let me know.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.530
He's having
trouble adjusting.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.738
We just want the entire
crew to transition back
as easily as possible.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.079
We don't want
any more incidents.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.832
Absolutely.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.124
Good. Nice talk.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.760
We've got to talk
to Henry about Zane.
Why?

25:56.930 --> 25:58.261
I've seen that look before.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.134
Good morning, kids!

26:00.309 --> 26:03.346
I brought blueberry muffins
and they're still warm.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.390
Doug's favorite.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.519
That's very thoughtful
of you, lsaac.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.726
Thank you.
To a disturbing degree.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.483
They're probably poisoned.
Not at all.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.941
This is my apology
for my attitude yesterday.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.906
It was immature and
unprofessional,

26:18.410 --> 26:20.241
and I'm really
sorry, you guys.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.036
I would really like
a fresh start.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.743
What do you say, Doug?

26:25.876 --> 26:27.366
I guess.
Oh, great!

26:27.544 --> 26:29.921
Well, let's dive
right in, then.
Come on!

26:32.674 --> 26:35.165
Ooh, looks like
the crown of the Orc King.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.800
And this is just
the scale model.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.461
The big one could turn
an entire Orc army

26:39.640 --> 26:40.629
into a bunch
of pussycats.

26:40.808 --> 26:44.050
This is an offshoot
of my R.S.S. My Riot
Suppression System.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.469
Wait, you mean the happy ray
that became an anger ray?

26:47.231 --> 26:51.190
Well, if a certain
former director of G.D.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.225
hadn't rushed me,
that wouldn't have happened.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.483
No offense.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.442
But I've been able
to work all the bugs
out of my ass.

26:58.742 --> 26:59.731
Excuse me?

27:00.828 --> 27:03.570
A.S.S.
Adrenaline
Suppression System.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.328
It's for
combat situations.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.241
lt targets the
neuro-transmitter
frequencies

27:08.418 --> 27:10.454
in the limbic area
of your enemy's brain.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.245
And it turns aggression
into submission.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.005
People just do
as they are told.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.174
And it really works?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.502
It's how I got promoted
to head up the
unconventional weapons lab.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.672
Hey, do you guys
want to see the latest

27:22.850 --> 27:24.090
in microwave
weapons technology?

27:24.726 --> 27:29.265
We can roast the innards
of a field mouse
from fifty miles up!

27:29.439 --> 27:31.646
Wait, why would you
want to do that?

27:31.817 --> 27:34.354
Fargo, come here.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.896
Man, am I glad to see you.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.482
Yeah, I heard about Martha.
Shh!

27:41.660 --> 27:42.945
Are you okay?

27:47.291 --> 27:49.748
I'll live. Something's
seriously wrong here.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.079
Tell me about it.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.870
l have to work with
stupid Parrish and he's
actually being nice to me.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.629
I mean with everything.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.291
Andy and his A.|. crew
are way too amped up
over my well being.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.131
They won't let me leave,
so I'm bugging out.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.509
Where are you "bugging" to?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.765
Going to see Jo and Carter.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.426
If I were you,
I'd do the same.

28:09.813 --> 28:14.147
PARRlSH: Douglas,
we have a full day
together, buddy! Chop, chop.

28:28.248 --> 28:31.365
Mr. Donovan.
Mr. Donovan.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.498
Mr. Donovan.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.461
That's quite enough,
Mr. Donovan.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.089
You can all return
to your posts.
Thank you very much.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.433
Man, how many
of you are there?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.888
Look, can't we talk
about this?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.853
I think we're done talking.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.979
(GRUNTS)
Agreed.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.273
Ready to get out of here? Mmm.
You have no idea.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.986
When Senator Wen
put the A.l.'s
in charge of G.D.,

29:09.164 --> 29:10.074
there was a huge outcry.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.114
The majority of people
chose to leave.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.157
Well, until they had
their redaction
interviews with Andy,

29:14.336 --> 29:15.826
when they had a sudden
change of heart.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.710
You think they were
threatened?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.712
No. He thinks
they were altered.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.999
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

29:24.179 --> 29:27.842
Dr. Deacon?
Dr. Monroe?
Anybody home?

29:29.309 --> 29:30.640
All right, it's Andy.
ANDY: Hello?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.347
Jo and Zane are
on their way over right now.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.682
They can't find us
all together,

29:34.856 --> 29:36.767
so the two of you,
don't make a sound.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.604
Dr. Monroe?
Anybody home?

29:43.865 --> 29:45.275
Hello?

29:47.202 --> 29:48.487
lt's Andy.

29:53.917 --> 29:57.284
Henry?
Yeah.
Don't worry, just relax.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.798
Andy, welcome.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.129
Dr. Deacon.

30:05.679 --> 30:06.668
(GASPS)

30:06.972 --> 30:10.840
Dr. Monroe.
I hope you are
settling back in.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.309
We are just catching up
on some lost time.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.721
Ah, glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

30:18.442 --> 30:22.526
We are looking
for Mr. Donovan.

30:23.030 --> 30:23.860
Haven't seen him.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.323
ANDY: (CHUCKLES)
Well, I'm not surprised.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.653
You could lose
an elephant in this room.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.571
(ALL LAUGHING)

30:36.501 --> 30:38.412
I told Henry the same thing.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.544
And I told you,
I have a system.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.797
Of course you do.

30:45.802 --> 30:46.882
Of course you do.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.182
Must be a great relief
to have the crew back.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.511
Oh, you have no idea.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.479
So, I'm sure

30:59.649 --> 31:03.517
that you wouldn't do
anything to jeopardize

31:03.695 --> 31:06.311
their safe transition
back into Eureka,

31:06.490 --> 31:07.525
now, would you?

31:09.409 --> 31:10.865
Absolutely not.

31:21.213 --> 31:26.048
Well, I won't keep you
anylonger
You two have a special day.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.928
Take them.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.551
(BOTH SCREAMING)

31:43.944 --> 31:45.354
(GASPING)

32:05.340 --> 32:07.547
What the hell?
Oh, no. Jack? Jack!

32:07.717 --> 32:08.547
Yeah.
Jack?

32:08.718 --> 32:10.254
Something's
on the trapdoor!

32:16.101 --> 32:18.092
(GROANING)

32:18.937 --> 32:21.474
Are you okay?
Yeah.

32:22.399 --> 32:23.809
I'm okay.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.272
The Andys took
Henry and Grace.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.492
You have to be
kidding me. You two?

32:36.705 --> 32:38.536
Look, we were waiting
for the right time.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.284
Well, you failed.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.081
Whoa, this is intense.
What the frak happened?

32:45.255 --> 32:47.246
Carter stole my girlfriend.
Seriously?

32:47.424 --> 32:50.416
No, well, sort of...
Zane, bigger issues!

32:50.594 --> 32:52.425
He's right. We have
to help Henry and Grace.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.757
Help them what?
Not get brain wiped.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.671
The Andys have been
fixing people
who can't follow orders.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.011
Do these people
seem happy to
an almost creepy degree?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.392
Yeah, big time.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.269
We may know
what they're using.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.429
Isaac's ass.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.814
That seems unlikely.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.690
Uh, his Adrenaline
Suppression System.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.227
lt alters brain
frequencies to make
people follow orders.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.066
I think Parrish
just got a hefty
dose of it himself.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.617
Maybe we can
give them a taste
of their own medicine.

33:14.784 --> 33:15.694
How?

33:15.869 --> 33:17.780
The A.S.S. alters brain
frequencies, so...

33:17.954 --> 33:20.741
So we change the frequency
to something that's harmless
to us, but bad for them.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.032
Yeah.
Ooh, if you can
stall the Andys,

33:23.210 --> 33:24.700
Holly and I can take out
the computer firewalls

33:24.878 --> 33:26.038
while Zane hacks the system.
Sure.

33:26.213 --> 33:30.081
We still need a way
to remotely access the network
so we can upload the virus.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.926
the onboard computer must
be networking with G.D.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.757
That's our ticket in.

33:36.932 --> 33:37.967
All right, we're connected.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.803
Now Fargo just
needs to drop the G.D.
firewalls and I'm in.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.935
Okay, is it me or did that
seem a little too easy?

33:44.105 --> 33:46.266
What, getting in here,
or getting over
my untimely death?

33:46.441 --> 33:50.480
Okay, look. I'm sorry
that you found out that way,

33:50.946 --> 33:53.608
and Carter didn't
steal me from you.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.023
I needed somebody
and so did he.

33:56.368 --> 34:00.111
Zane, I fell in love.

34:01.998 --> 34:02.908
I didn't do anything wrong.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.334
This leads to
SARAH's mainframe.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.677
It's like a backdoor
to her brain.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.837
We can drop her
firewalls from here.

34:19.015 --> 34:21.131
Okay, then.
Let's do this backdoor!

34:25.230 --> 34:28.142
Let's hope
Carter and Allison
can buy us some time.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.393
Glad you listened
to reason, Sheriff.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.938
I'm not sure
I would call brainwashing
reason, but okay.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.947
Human aggression
is your greatest weakness.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.983
We're just
protecting you
from yourselves.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.196
Of course.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.704
Henry, are you guys okay?

34:44.874 --> 34:46.660
We've been better.
All right, we're going
to get you out of there.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.793
Your predictable
overconfidence is
rather remarkable, Sheriff.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.544
It's part of
my girlish charm.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.546
Andy, can't we
be reasonable here?

34:53.717 --> 34:57.710
That would require
that we're all being
forthcoming and honest.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.465
But that isn't what's
happening here, is it?

35:03.435 --> 35:06.097
There it is.
The access panel.
Awesome.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.639
(BEEPING)

35:15.113 --> 35:15.977
Okay.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.989
Now, we yank the firewalls
and Zane can hack the system.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.318
You know,
you're kind of sexy
when you're corrupt.

35:24.998 --> 35:27.455
SARAH: What are you
doing, Douglas?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.082
Oh.

35:32.255 --> 35:35.747
I've known you a long time,
and I don't care what
your programing says,

35:35.925 --> 35:38.917
I know that deep down
inside you wouldn't
want to hurt anyone.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.468
You're right, Sheriff.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.769
I want everyone to be safe.

35:48.146 --> 35:48.931
Yeah.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.644
And this is the only way.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.694
The firewalls
are almost down.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.324
Upload is ready to go.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.487
Now we just
watch out for any
of our A.|. friends.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.243
Found one.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.267
Zane.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.100
The firewalls are still up.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.977
Okay, what do we do?

36:35.235 --> 36:36.441
Here, take this.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.233
What now?

36:39.531 --> 36:40.941
Now we run.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.274
Yeah.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.966
SARAH: Stop, Douglas,
you're hurting me.
Almost there!

37:02.137 --> 37:03.252
Okay.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.139
Andy, you don't have
to do this to them.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.559
You're right.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.896
I'm going to do it
to all of you.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.159
Here's Andy!

37:32.917 --> 37:35.169
Oh, God. He's coming.
Faster!

38:21.216 --> 38:25.004
I can't believe
you thought appealing
to my emotion would work!

38:25.345 --> 38:27.757
Actually, we didn't.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.630
Last one! Got it!

38:31.267 --> 38:32.518

Checkmate.

you won't hold it against me.

what about the rest of us?

39:41.170 --> 39:44.162
Right. Well, once
you've completed
your neuro recalibration,

39:44.340 --> 39:46.922
we'll talk.
That sounds super, boss.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.718
I kind of like lsaac
better this way.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.878
Yeah, me too.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.310
That's good news, huh?

39:56.477 --> 39:59.184
Yeah. Yeah. Back to normal.

39:59.564 --> 40:03.022
Look, Zane, I know that
you're upset with me,

40:03.776 --> 40:06.768
but I really, really hope
that we can be friends.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.781
Yeah. I know you do.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.034
Look, I respect the fact
that you're with Carter,

40:15.204 --> 40:17.786
but I can't help but wonder
what might have been.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.788
So, friends might
take a while.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.083
Yeah.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.592
So, what do you want to do?

40:37.810 --> 40:39.016
We'll figure it out,
you know.

Would you like
to join us for dinner?

that would be great.

41:35.535 --> 41:36.866
