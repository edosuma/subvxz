<i>You'?</i>

01:26.780 --> 01:27.667
No.

John?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.430
Yeah, I can.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.503
I can what'?

01:37.340 --> 01:38.671
Win the run.

03:41.340 --> 03:44.628

- No.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.987
- Are you Roger's brother'?
- No.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.225
Are you Roger?

03:52.780 --> 03:54.748
No, I'm... I'm Jim.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.387
'You have no new messages.'

05:52.180 --> 05:53.864
'l couldn't be prouder.'

05:54.020 --> 05:57.149
The first family member
to go to university.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.780
Er, eye contact
or it's eight years of bad sex.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.226
That's impossible, I'm afraid.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.303
You're not getting it,
not until you sort the front garden.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.985
Great, now I know
when you'll be having it.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.869
He's so miserable,
I think he's sick.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.351
- Fuck you.
- Oi.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.631
ls that yours'?

06:18.140 --> 06:21.542
- It's Jackie's.
- What, little Jackie Taylor'!

06:21.700 --> 06:24.271
- She smokes.
- Why do you have it'?

06:24.420 --> 06:26.149
Because, Michelle...

06:27.620 --> 06:28.951
we're together.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.025
Double celebration, then.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.830
Yeah, I guess it is.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.745
Where's the glasses'! I think you'd better
pour me one of those champagnes.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.380
He's lying. I saw her
hanging oui with Michael.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.746
No, you didn't.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.504
She's wrong.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.389
Michelle's a weird fucking name anyway.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.826
Jim.

07:52.860 --> 07:54.066
Boring, isn't it'?

07:56.940 --> 07:59.625
Off on my long walk again.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.908
Go on my walk three times a week now.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.824
Keeps me busy.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.381
Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursday.

08:06.540 --> 08:07.621
Today's Saturday.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.069
Yeah, copy that, Clive.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.020
Reminds me of being
in the army up here.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.705
I was a parachuter, yeah?

08:17.860 --> 08:19.544
I could parachute off this.

08:22.780 --> 08:24.509
Or I could jump without the parachute.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.064
Yeah, copy that, Clive.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.025
Hey!

08:43.179 --> 08:44.625
What's happening, shit pants?

09:12.140 --> 09:14.029
We've got to win this country run.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.070
Things are just shit.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.269
My life is one big pile of shit.

09:36.940 --> 09:39.705
Tonight's screening
of The Piper's Revenge

Will run at 92 minutes.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.591
Enjoy.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.420
- 'We've lost the Piper.'
- 'What do you mean, you lost him?'

10:32.460 --> 10:34.860
'He escaped last night, boss.
No evidence of him getting oui.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.425
- 'It's like he disappeared.'
- 'You better find him.'

10:36.580 --> 10:38.389
'Boys reckon he's headed
back to Pennsylvania.

10:38.540 --> 10:41.703
- 'Don't worry, boss. I got this.'
- 'No way. It's too dangerous.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.942
'We need to send
somebody desperate.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.022
'Sammy.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.629
'You're rehired. Welcome back.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.384
'We got a job for you.'

10:54.580 --> 10:58.062
'It's a year today since
he massacred those innocent children.

10:58.220 --> 11:01.429
'Authorities are warning people
to stay inside.

11:01.580 --> 11:05.141
'The Piper is said to be mid 20s
and look just like one of us.'

12:35.260 --> 12:36.830
All right'!

12:36.980 --> 12:38.345
Hey, Cliff.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.466
What you been up to?

12:44.420 --> 12:46.343
Just thinking, mainly.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.505
Listen, Jim, I hope you don't mind,
but I think me and Jackie are dating.

12:52.780 --> 12:55.226
No. Why would I mind? It's fine.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.462
I don't know.
I always thought you liked her.

12:57.620 --> 13:00.908
No, you've got that wrong.
Er, I'm into older chicks now.

13:01.820 --> 13:02.981
<i>Oh nice.</i>

13:06.500 --> 13:09.231
Also, could I have my Nintendo back'?

13:09.380 --> 13:12.111
No. My mum chucked it out.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.831
- Right.
- Cliff.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.384
Get in.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.867
- Will you help me find him'!
- Sorry, man. I have to go.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.909
See you later, shit dick!

13:29.420 --> 13:30.660
Cliff'?

13:32.700 --> 13:33.906
Cliff'?

15:44.060 --> 15:45.949
Look after yourself, won't you?

15:46.100 --> 15:47.670
I love you so much.

16:44.660 --> 16:47.948
- Do you guys have any friends?
- Yeah, your mum has a few. Why'?

16:48.100 --> 16:49.989
I don't know. You just...

16:50.140 --> 16:53.587
Jim, you need to try and make the effort
to hang out with the other kids.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.311
Sol put him in a headlock
and fed him a whole loaf of bread.

17:08.780 --> 17:09.702
Hi.

17:09.859 --> 17:13.103
I'm having a birthday party
and I wanted to invite you guys.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.991
- Dada!
- Ooh.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.462
What do you think, darling?
Do you like the cake? Huh?

17:43.620 --> 17:46.988
Let's have a look al you.
Now, are you sure you're gonna be OK'!

17:47.140 --> 17:49.302
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.427
16?

17:53.380 --> 17:55.189
- I'm 17.
- Are you'!

17:56.420 --> 17:57.706
- Yeah.
- Oh.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.780
It's gonna have lo do.
You need to leave.

18:02.860 --> 18:04.385
They're gonna be here. Leave.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.542
- Leave!
- OK.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.031
- All right?
- Please leave.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.227
OK.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.144
- Bye, darling.
- No, no.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.143
Ooh.

19:14.660 --> 19:15.991
Yeah.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.471
It went well.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.071
Can I have a glass?

20:44.420 --> 20:45.751
'Who's there?'

21:03.820 --> 21:07.222
- Quiet tonight.
- Shh. Yes.

21:08.740 --> 21:10.151
Is it'!

21:10.300 --> 21:13.588
Do you have any new movies?
I've just... I've seen this one loads.

21:17.060 --> 21:19.267
- You know, it's probably the rats.
- What is?

21:19.420 --> 21:20.785
The lack of customers.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.349
They're listening.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.422
Who?

21:26.580 --> 21:29.629
The people in the walls.
They're listening.

21:30.620 --> 21:33.544
They don't know that I know but I do.
I know they're coming for us.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.671
Trust no one.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.266
Stay away from tap water.
Leave now.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.024
Don't come back.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.224
How's school?

22:41.980 --> 22:42.981
Great.

22:43.140 --> 22:44.904
I won the school race.

22:47.980 --> 22:49.505
How's Michelle'!

22:49.660 --> 22:50.582
No word.

22:51.780 --> 22:53.669
She may be dead.

22:53.820 --> 22:55.549
It's probably best we move on.

22:57.940 --> 22:59.510
Where did Michael come'!

23:01.580 --> 23:03.548
- Why?
- I saw his mum today

23:03.700 --> 23:05.702
so I invited him around for supper.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.104
Without asking me?
Maybe I don't want him around here.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.182
<i>Why not?</i>

23:28.060 --> 23:29.789
- Hi, Michael.
- Hiya.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.385
- Long time no see.
- Yeah, I know.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.941
- Come on in.
- Er, I can't, sorry.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.023
I just came to say thanks
for inviting me around,

23:36.180 --> 23:37.909
but I've made plans.

23:38.060 --> 23:39.664
Oh, that's a shame.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.470
Well, Jim's here.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.861
Jim, why don't we save your supper

23:44.020 --> 23:46.864
and you can warm it up
when you get back later?

24:32.020 --> 24:34.227
You make me so wet.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.431
Hop out a second, Jimbo.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.906
Sure.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.309

26:22.940 --> 26:24.351
You're American.

26:25.540 --> 26:26.587
That's right.

26:27.380 --> 26:28.711
You look scared.

26:30.220 --> 26:33.508
Iam scared. I'm high.
I can't feel my fingers.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.665
The key is to just ride it out.
Why don't you try laughing?

26:38.740 --> 26:40.310
Laugh with me.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.627
Here, come on, laugh.

26:58.660 --> 27:02.301
- You want a beer?
- No. Are you a pervert?

27:03.420 --> 27:04.387
No. Are you?

27:04.540 --> 27:07.305
No, obviously.
Just don't come near me, OK'?

27:07.460 --> 27:09.269
- Cos that would be a mistake.
- Would it?

27:09.420 --> 27:11.661
Yeah. My family are trained killers.

27:12.260 --> 27:13.785
Sounds fair enough.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.184
- And we have guns.
- Do you?

27:16.940 --> 27:19.750
No, but I know people.
I could gel one. I could gel a gun.

27:20.420 --> 27:21.342
OK.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.064
So, what do you do
around here for fun?

27:24.220 --> 27:26.222
Um, I play my computer games
and stuff.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.550
What kind of stuff'?

27:28.700 --> 27:30.589
Mainly I just play
my computer games.

27:30.740 --> 27:33.823
I mean, I used to go to the cinema
as well, but I'm banned.

27:33.980 --> 27:36.586
I used to have a dog,
but he ran away.

27:36.740 --> 27:37.787
No shit'?

27:37.940 --> 27:41.183
You know, I had a dog
that ran away too.

27:41.340 --> 27:43.069
Yeah'? Well, they run away to die.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.229
What are you doing here?

27:47.380 --> 27:49.826
Well, you know, I had to get away.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.984
I mean, I felt like
life was passing me by,

27:54.140 --> 27:56.222
and there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.104
Yeah, life sucks.

28:00.260 --> 28:02.991
Well, it depends
what you make of it.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.984
If you sil around
feeling sorry for yourself, yeah.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.270
Do you believe in God'!

28:12.140 --> 28:13.062
No.

28:13.700 --> 28:16.306
I think if he exists,
he needs to give me a break.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.149
Maybe you just need to man up a bit,

28:25.660 --> 28:27.424
instead of being a little bitch.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.668
Follow the track through the fields,
down past the river,

28:48.820 --> 28:51.300
then back to the finishing line.
Any questions?

28:51.460 --> 28:53.110
- Are you a pussy?
- No, sir.

28:53.260 --> 28:54.910
- Are you'!
- No, sir.

28:57.140 --> 29:00.144
- Jack'?
- Yes, sir. I don't have my gym kit.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.946
On three, everyone say Jack is a pussy.
One, two, three.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.340
Jack's a pussy.

29:12.660 --> 29:15.982
Ha-ha, hey!
What's happening, shit pants?

29:16.140 --> 29:17.585
Stop where you are.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.422
Take a bath, you smelly fuck.

30:38.180 --> 30:41.741
Every time I see you,
you look depressed.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.105
I am depressed.

30:44.820 --> 30:46.982
Come on,
let's get the fuck out of here.

30:53.900 --> 30:57.143
- I stole from here once.
- Really'!

30:57.300 --> 30:59.302
What did you steal?

30:59.460 --> 31:00.791
Just a knife.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.862
That's pretty fucked-up.

31:04.020 --> 31:05.181
Yeah.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.947
- Seriously?
- I know.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.670
Girls?

31:13.820 --> 31:15.709
You don't want
to die nameless, do you?

31:16.660 --> 31:17.991
- No.
- No!

31:19.580 --> 31:22.060
OK, see, the key...

31:23.140 --> 31:26.587
is to be mysterious but also open.

31:31.620 --> 31:32.985
Hey, girls.

31:38.340 --> 31:40.388
Seen you here a few times before.

31:40.540 --> 31:44.101
Er, what are you...
What are you doing here... this time?

31:45.820 --> 31:47.060
Buying food.

31:49.940 --> 31:51.271
Buying food, yeah.

31:52.260 --> 31:54.024
My... my name's Jim.

31:55.020 --> 31:56.545
I'm, er... a male.

31:57.580 --> 32:00.504
I'm legal, of legal age.

32:00.660 --> 32:02.660
- And, er...
- What the fuck are you doing'!

32:02.780 --> 32:05.670
I had a dog once, but he's dead.

32:05.820 --> 32:08.710
And I'm up for most things.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.067
I'm mysterious, but I'm open.

32:15.340 --> 32:18.583
- I've been thinking about your problem.
- I don't have a problem.

32:18.740 --> 32:21.346
That's right, you don't.
You're just surrounded by friends.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.264
I can help you
put an end to this shit.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.585
How'?

32:25.740 --> 32:27.424
By making you cool.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.820
It's not going to work. I'm already uncool.
You can't erase that existing image.

32:31.860 --> 32:34.591
Yeah, we don't, we change it.

32:36.260 --> 32:39.582
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes, it is. Shoot him.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.471
Wait a minute.
Right side's the gay side.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.460
- Shoot him in the other.
- No, no, wait, wait!

32:50.940 --> 32:52.783
Girls like Jilly like tough guys, right?

32:52.940 --> 32:54.271
- Jackie.
- OK, fair enough.

32:54.420 --> 32:56.502
What you got to do is,
you got to be able to step up

32:56.660 --> 32:59.823
and show her that you're willing
to break somebody's dick.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.789
'Let's say I'm a bully,

33:01.940 --> 33:05.387
'and I say something to you bad,
really bad.'

33:05.540 --> 33:08.384
- What do you say'!
- I'd probably say, "Don't say that."

33:08.540 --> 33:09.746
OK.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.382
Let's just say that... I push you.

33:13.540 --> 33:14.780
What do you say?

33:14.940 --> 33:16.863
I'd say, "Fuck up."

33:17.020 --> 33:19.466
- Fuck up?
- I meant to say, "Shut the fuck up."

33:19.620 --> 33:21.190
OK, well, don't say that.

33:21.340 --> 33:23.069
That doesn't make any sense.

33:23.220 --> 33:26.508
What you do is
you push that fucker back.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.586
'Harder.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.266
'Don't ever take any shit
from anyone, ever.'

33:38.260 --> 33:39.182
Harder.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.462
Again!

33:44.260 --> 33:45.591
Put some snap into it.

33:47.620 --> 33:48.507
Yeah.

33:59.020 --> 34:00.909
Don't act suspicious.

34:01.060 --> 34:02.425
You fucking run.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.906
To your new balls. Cheers.

34:16.060 --> 34:17.300
Cheers.

34:20.179 --> 34:22.831
You know, this doesn't...
This doesn't feel so good.

34:22.980 --> 34:26.462
- It looks infected.
- Ll is infected, but it's badass.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.384
The four dots are the walls
and that's you in the middle.

34:28.540 --> 34:30.065
People are gonna think
you've done serious time.

34:30.219 --> 34:31.346
- They will'?
- Yeah.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.739
And what about these?
These are acceptable? These are in?

34:33.820 --> 34:35.663
Yeah, dude, really in.

34:35.820 --> 34:38.221
- You just don't have yours pierced.
- Yeah.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.021
I've decided I'm gonna
help you win this race

34:43.179 --> 34:44.864
cos you're not capable.

34:45.020 --> 34:48.581
- You have the coordination of a cripple.
- I'm ready.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.143
I don't think you are,
but I like your confidence.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.384
- What about my face?
- What about it'?

34:54.540 --> 34:56.659
It's very round.
It's all good saying, "Be confident,"

34:56.739 --> 34:58.500
but you have a structured face
to back it up.

34:58.620 --> 35:01.191
There's nothing we can do
about your face.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.751
You're a solid four.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.904
You're actually a three, OK?
But I'm not gonna fucking lie to you.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.906
If you were to stay yourself
with that face, you'd be fucked.

35:10.060 --> 35:13.143
When you talk to people now,
you look like you're taking a shit.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.631
You're right, I do.

35:15.620 --> 35:17.110
I'm not ready.
I don't wanna do this anymore.

35:17.260 --> 35:20.025
I want out. I'm just me.
I'm still me. I'm not "not me" enough.

35:20.180 --> 35:22.387
I've just got an infected tattoo
and my ears pierced.

35:22.540 --> 35:25.464
Hey... stop being a bitch.

35:36.420 --> 35:39.151
Right, guys, this is it.
This is what we've been waiting for.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.189
Now, I'm done with speeches
so how does this sound'?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.422
You win or I'm gone.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.464
- Whose school are you with'?
- Yours.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.224
We're in the same school.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.621
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

35:52.780 --> 35:53.667
Good luck.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.470
Fuck you, bug eyes.

36:03.180 --> 36:04.705
This could end really badly.

36:08.780 --> 36:10.748
Turn around, you little fuckers!

36:27.860 --> 36:29.464
Bloody hell, son.
You're miles ahead of everyone.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.351
- Where are they'!
- I won, I won.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.831
Jim.

36:36.060 --> 36:37.983
There's no way that faggot won.
Ll was a fix.

36:38.140 --> 36:40.620
- Hey, you shut up. He's a winner.
- Dad, a man chased us with a gun.

36:40.780 --> 36:43.386
Don't be so childish
and don't be a sore loser, Leon.

36:43.540 --> 36:45.941
- Hi.
- That was a fucking piss-take.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.751
I just won the race.

36:50.260 --> 36:51.500
Can I ask you on a dale?

36:54.220 --> 36:56.109
Maybe.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.785
Pick me up at the Grippins.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.831
Mam, Dad,
this is my new friend Dean.

37:06.780 --> 37:07.827
Hello.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.867
I had some pretty crazy times back then.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.909
- Sounds like it.
- Sounds great.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.461
But what about you guys,
you guys must've messed around,

37:18.620 --> 37:20.031
experimented, right'?

37:20.180 --> 37:22.501
I bet you went wild as wolves.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.230
Not so much.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.781
I did a lol of drugs in my early 20s.

37:26.940 --> 37:30.740
So much so, I ended up
in a pretty sticky situation with two guys.

37:37.180 --> 37:39.547
Here's to Jim being
the fastest kid in the county.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.350
We couldn't be prouder.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.990
Speech, speech.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.983
Er, I won.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.107
End of speech.

37:46.260 --> 37:48.228
So, Dean, where are you from'!

37:49.140 --> 37:51.461
- Pennsylvania.
- And what brings you here?

37:53.500 --> 37:54.740
The truth'!

37:57.020 --> 38:01.230
I'm on the run.
I am... guilty of murder.

38:05.460 --> 38:06.507
Ah!

38:08.740 --> 38:10.310
No, I just wanted to come to a place

38:10.460 --> 38:13.669
where the people look miserable
but sound happy.

38:13.820 --> 38:17.302
Hm, well. And your family,
are they still in the States?

38:18.140 --> 38:20.586
Well, I was dealt a bad hand
when I was young.

38:22.220 --> 38:23.346
They're dead.

38:28.460 --> 38:30.588
This bread is fucking great.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.667
- Did you make this yourself?
- No.

38:33.820 --> 38:36.471
Sun, good pick.

38:36.620 --> 38:39.351
So, how about you guys?
What do you do? What's your story?

38:39.500 --> 38:42.344
Let me guess. Model'!

38:42.500 --> 38:45.026
Close. Nurse.

38:45.180 --> 38:47.262
I was a golfer, semi-professionally.

38:47.420 --> 38:48.501
- Were you?
- Yeah.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.310
I used to play a lot
when you were a kid.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.031
- I don't remember.
- We should grab a game.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.544
Yeah, I'm in.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.350
Hey.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.424
To my new neighbours
and friends.

39:03.180 --> 39:04.147
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Noticed your gate was hanging off
so I figured I'd fix that fucker.

40:11.020 --> 40:12.351
Hey, buddy-

40:12.500 --> 40:13.661
Michael, right?

40:14.380 --> 40:15.586
- Yeah.
- All right, listen, dick weed.

40:15.740 --> 40:18.471
I need you to do something for me.
Stay away from Jackie.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.941
- She's my girlfriend.
- Wrong.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.148
Do you want me to shit
down your neck? Cos I will.

40:24.300 --> 40:27.031
My buddy Jim likes her now
so you're gonna slay away.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.581
If you don't, I'll kill your mother
while I'm fucking her

40:29.740 --> 40:31.860
and then I'm gonna come back,
chop your dad's dick off

40:31.900 --> 40:32.822
and feed it to him.

40:32.980 --> 40:35.347
And if you still don't do something,
I'm gonna come back

40:35.500 --> 40:37.150
and fucking thump you with my car

40:37.300 --> 40:39.780
and your fucking body's gonna fly

and I'm gonna cut you
up your fucking back,

40:44.620 --> 40:46.031
open up your fucking ribs,

40:46.180 --> 40:49.343
take your fucking brain
and fucking stomp on it.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.025
You got that?

40:52.740 --> 40:54.629
OK, good talk.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.948
Hey, Sexy pants.

41:23.620 --> 41:24.826
Women are weapons.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.347
Their sexiness is an asset
they will use against you.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.865
You have to rely on charm.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.068
If you don't have anything nice to say,
don't say anything.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.142
Got it.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.541
Did you sleep last night?
You have terrible bags under the eyes.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.509
- Oh, no, they were born that way.
- Oh, that's a shame.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.900
You look malnourished.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.028
How much aftershave did you put on'?
You smell like shit.

41:40.180 --> 41:41.227
Really?

41:41.380 --> 41:43.140
- Shave down there'!
- You didn't tell me to.

41:43.220 --> 41:44.301
If there's a kiss,

41:44.460 --> 41:47.225
you stick your tongue down her throat,
show her you're the man.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.224
If she's playing with her hair,
you go for a boob grab, squeeze tight.

41:50.380 --> 41:52.860
Skip all oral. It's too complicated.

41:53.020 --> 41:55.227
Show her the lat and it's a done deal.
Good luck.

41:55.380 --> 41:56.905
Don't be yourself.

41:59.060 --> 42:01.142
Don't smile, be cool.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.229
Come on, show me your cool face.

42:06.860 --> 42:08.589
Show me the fucking ice box.

42:16.620 --> 42:17.701
<i>I am cool.</i>

42:45.380 --> 42:46.620
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.267
No, thanks.

43:08.260 --> 43:09.989
- Are you sure'?
- Yeah.

43:26.380 --> 43:28.826
Excuse me, would it be possible
to change my seal?

43:28.980 --> 43:30.266
No.

43:30.420 --> 43:33.026
- What drink do you want?
- Um...

43:33.180 --> 43:34.591
Er, two beers, gorgeous.

43:35.420 --> 43:38.264
- Can I see your ID'?
- My ID'?

43:38.420 --> 43:39.342
Yeah.

43:46.620 --> 43:48.907
Actually, I'll have a water, please.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.186
<i>You'?</i>

43:50.340 --> 43:51.671
- Can I have a beer'?
- Sure.

43:53.180 --> 43:54.102
Nice.

44:11.140 --> 44:12.665
How is it'?

44:15.740 --> 44:16.787
It's good.

44:36.260 --> 44:37.625
We have to try and be quiet.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.431
I've never kissed anyone before,

45:58.580 --> 46:00.662
so it's probably not
going to be up to standards.

46:10.380 --> 46:12.144
- Do you like mat'!
- Not really.

46:25.820 --> 46:26.821
Did you see that'?

46:34.700 --> 46:36.860
'I constantly wake up
and I can't move my body

46:36.980 --> 46:38.823
'and I feel like
somethings holding me down.

46:38.980 --> 46:41.347
'I get like that all the time.'

46:41.500 --> 46:44.026
'l have a scary dream.

46:44.180 --> 46:47.389
'I'm in a plane and the pilot comes up
and he says, "We're about to crash."

46:47.540 --> 46:50.828
'I don't know why he tells me,
but, anyway, we start falling.

46:52.020 --> 46:54.387
'We're jumping into the water
and then...'

46:54.540 --> 46:57.305
I remember that hitting water
really hard is like hitting concrete,

46:57.460 --> 46:59.747
so we're going to die anyway.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.346
Then I get this idea to take my shoes off
and I chuck them into the water

47:02.500 --> 47:04.821
and it causes a splash
for me to dive into

47:04.980 --> 47:06.823
and I survive.

47:06.980 --> 47:10.143
- Smart.
- I wonder what it means, though.

47:10.980 --> 47:12.869
Probably doesn't mean anything.

47:17.820 --> 47:20.027
What do you want to do
when you're older?'

47:22.420 --> 47:25.788
'l want to do something
significant, and then die at an early age.'

47:34.980 --> 47:36.744
Ah, it's been a long time.

47:36.900 --> 47:40.347
Don't expect anything extraordinary,
not to start with, anyway.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.422
Ah.

47:43.700 --> 47:44.781
God, golf is good.

47:47.260 --> 47:49.627
Just need to get rid
of this belly fat, that's all.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.431
If I was to give you
one piece of advice,

47:53.580 --> 47:55.548
Don't let your wife
become your best friend

47:55.700 --> 47:57.589
because you lose all other friends.

47:57.740 --> 48:01.665
I mean, I'm not unhappy or anything.
I'm just saying I've no friends.

48:02.820 --> 48:04.709
How's Jimbo doing'!

48:04.860 --> 48:06.783
Honestly, not so good.

48:07.540 --> 48:09.542
Do you find he lies a lot'!

48:09.700 --> 48:11.031
Yeah, I guess.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.222
Anyways, I'm sure it's nothing.

48:15.380 --> 48:16.711
What do you say that you let me

48:16.860 --> 48:19.591
take you and the beautiful lady
out to dinner tonight?

48:19.740 --> 48:22.186
Oh, that would be lovely.
Thank you, yeah.

48:22.340 --> 48:24.263
I'm so glad he's got a nice friend.

48:24.420 --> 48:27.629
- Sure, OK.
- We've been really worried about him.

48:30.420 --> 48:32.502
- Are you smoking?
- No.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.424
Don't tell your mother.

48:34.580 --> 48:36.230
I'll get the balls.

48:36.380 --> 48:38.223
- How did it go?
- Yeah, it was pretty good.

48:38.380 --> 48:40.380
The boob grab wasn't a highlight,
but overall good.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.700
Did you do what I told you?

48:41.860 --> 48:44.261
- All the way, right?
- Yeah, we went most of the way.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.991
We ended up playing computer games
which was pretty cool.

48:50.020 --> 48:52.102
You ready for the party tonight?

48:52.260 --> 48:55.309
- What party?
- The one you're throwing.

48:55.460 --> 48:57.667
- What about my parents'?
- It's all planned, OK?

48:57.820 --> 48:59.185
A small gathering.

48:59.340 --> 49:02.310
I'm gonna take your parents out
around seven.

49:02.460 --> 49:05.145
I'll get them high and drunk
until the early hours.

49:07.020 --> 49:09.307
I may have to fuck your mum
if there's a dip.

49:09.460 --> 49:11.030
Thanks so much.

49:28.220 --> 49:31.588
- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- No, I've got the shits.

49:31.740 --> 49:33.151
On, Jim!

49:36.140 --> 49:37.983

Must be a bug going round
or something.

52:04.620 --> 52:06.827
- There's someone a! The door for you.
- All right.

52:10.300 --> 52:11.267
Hey.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.149
Why are you telling people
we shagged?

52:14.100 --> 52:15.022
I'm not.

52:15.180 --> 52:17.387
I kissed you
because I felt sorry for you.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.301
- Yeah, I...
- Now fuck off and leave me alone.

52:22.020 --> 52:25.581
You're fucking dead, son.
There's no way you won that race.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.911
- What are you doing?
- I'll fight you for her.

52:31.060 --> 52:33.506
- You're a fucking prick.
- Yeah, boy, you're dead.

52:33.660 --> 52:35.264
I'm not gonna fight you for her.
She likes me now.

52:35.420 --> 52:36.831
She likes you because
I weren't allowed to see her.

52:36.980 --> 52:38.311
Your friend said
he'd shit down my neck.

52:38.460 --> 52:41.145
That's fucked-up shit.
Do it, Mike. Fuck him up.

52:41.300 --> 52:43.268
- Why would you do this to me?
- Do what?

52:43.420 --> 52:44.831
You know 'what. You're a dick.

52:46.140 --> 52:48.507
- Don't fucking push me.
- You're fucking weird.

52:48.660 --> 52:50.185
Leon's right, you're a freak.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.828
I'm glad I'm not your friend any more.

52:55.700 --> 52:57.065
OK. Well, whatever.

53:02.460 --> 53:04.144
Fuck you! Get the fuck off me!

53:08.820 --> 53:10.822
- You're fucking mental.
- Jim!

53:11.420 --> 53:13.184
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

53:13.340 --> 53:15.547
- Get off!
- Get off me!

54:22.460 --> 54:24.508
'You've done it, son.

54:25.540 --> 54:29.465
'I'm putting you forward for the nationals.
I want you taking this seriously.'

54:31.420 --> 54:34.264
Training every day,
eating property.

54:35.020 --> 54:37.466
You know, I realised
I was in school with your old man.

54:37.620 --> 54:41.830
He was the complete opposite to you.
Kept his head down and that was it.

54:41.980 --> 54:44.551
'Bloody hell. He was bullied, mind.

54:47.020 --> 54:49.546
'Maybe we should send him
to see someone.'

54:49.700 --> 54:52.385
'He thinks you prefer his sister.'

54:52.540 --> 54:53.587
'OK.'

54:53.740 --> 54:56.141
And again, I don't want
lo make him step in it,

54:56.980 --> 54:59.460
but he cheated on the school race.

55:00.420 --> 55:01.467
And...

55:01.620 --> 55:04.510
when I firs! Met him,
he said you had guns, Dad.

55:04.660 --> 55:06.549
'Hal I don't.'

55:06.700 --> 55:08.987
And he stole a knife
from the supermarket.

55:09.140 --> 55:12.269
- You caught him stealing cheese once.
- That was obviously the start of it.

55:12.420 --> 55:14.343
'Thank you.'

55:14.500 --> 55:18.141
'What Jim is,
is a pathological liar.

55:18.300 --> 55:19.825
'I've seen this before.'

55:20.340 --> 55:25.028
And it is a key sign
of psychopathic behaviour.

55:25.180 --> 55:29.026
Now, no parent ever thinks
their child will grow up

55:29.180 --> 55:31.945
to be a serial-killing
rapist or mass murderer

55:32.100 --> 55:34.102
but you got to be ready for anything.

55:35.220 --> 55:36.142
Mom,

55:36.980 --> 55:40.063
just think about all
the future butchered victims

55:40.220 --> 55:42.461
crying out to be saved.

55:49.820 --> 55:50.946
What are you doing?

55:52.060 --> 55:53.585
Looking after you. You're ill.

55:53.740 --> 55:56.823
No, I'm not. I'm fine.
You've made me look crazy.

55:56.980 --> 55:58.982
You were almost there.
You just needed a push.

55:59.140 --> 56:01.427
Listen, I'm done, OK?
I'm done with it. I want you gone.

56:01.580 --> 56:03.423
I'm not going anywhere, fat face.

56:04.540 --> 56:05.985
You're trying to drown a shark.

56:06.700 --> 56:10.750
Oh, yeah? Well, you're trying
to drown a shark as well.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.981
We're both sharks.

56:14.980 --> 56:18.826
Listen to me. Fuck off somewhere
and don't come back.

56:18.980 --> 56:21.506
Stop being a pussy
and just kill yourself already.

56:21.660 --> 56:25.506
Bring the curtain down
cos it doesn't get any better from here.

56:25.660 --> 56:27.742
Do it, or I will.

56:29.100 --> 56:30.864
- I'll tell my parents.
- Yeah.

56:31.020 --> 56:33.500
Cos they'll believe some fuck
that talks to the wall.

56:34.420 --> 56:36.420
Keep your mouth shut
or I'll get rid of them first.

56:36.500 --> 56:37.706
Got it?

56:37.860 --> 56:39.908
Head down, mouth shut.

56:40.060 --> 56:40.982
Good talk.

56:49.580 --> 56:51.628
Well, I'm not taking it back.

56:51.780 --> 56:52.702
You can.

56:53.620 --> 56:54.951
It's humiliating.

58:14.540 --> 58:16.508
It's a lovely facility, very safe.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.867
Well, it looks like a good solution to me.

58:21.900 --> 58:23.743
Does nobody find it weird
that this guy just showed up?

58:23.900 --> 58:26.267
- Don't be rude.
- What's this?

58:28.540 --> 58:30.110
Me and your mum
are worried about you.

58:30.260 --> 58:33.469
- What, so you want to send me away'?
- It's not normal to act the way you are.

58:33.620 --> 58:35.668
It's not fucking me, OK? It's him.

58:36.420 --> 58:38.741
He's crazy, Mam.
He threatened to kill me.

58:38.900 --> 58:40.709
- Jim!
- Mam, you have to believe me.

58:40.860 --> 58:42.510
It's not me, Mam.
I swear, it's not me.

58:42.660 --> 58:44.708
It's him. He's crazy.
He said he'd kill me if I do anything.

58:44.860 --> 58:47.704
He said he'd kill you guys.
It's not me. I swear, Mam. It's not me.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.506
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

58:53.300 --> 58:54.426
Stay strong.

58:57.420 --> 58:59.184
Oh, man.

59:55.460 --> 59:58.145
'Hey, it's me.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.785
'I need to go away for a few days.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:06.944
'Stopping this guy could give me
the respect I've been waiting for.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.865
'Look after yourself, OK?'

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.070
'Hello, is Michael there?'

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.382
It's, um... It's Jim.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.062
Hello?

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.429
'Hello, is Michelle there?'
'Hold on, I'll gel her.'

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.105
- 'Hello?'
- All right?

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.060
- Look, you need to help me.
- 'What's wrong?'

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.068
An American sicko
has moved in next door.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.587
I'm in big trouble. He's made me cool
and turned everyone against me.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.220
He's threatening to kill Mam and Dad
if I do anything.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.666
'Jim, I'm busy.'

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.743
No, wait. What do I do?

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.947
'Grow up.'

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.661
One minute he's your little angel,
the next he's chopping fucking heads off.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.746
But, for now,
three tickets to the movies.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.221
- Great idea.
- You bet.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.706
- Oh, Dean!
- Very kind.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.026
Thank you.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.826
Fucking A.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.346
Can't wait.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.509
Oh, not those seals.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.947
I fucking hate those seats.
Over here.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.545
Over here.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.340
Yeah...

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.903
Much better.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.464
Walked across the viaduct.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.429
Sizing up the parachute jump.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.870
Yeah, copy, Clive.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.511
Hello? Hello!

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.822
Play the fucking movie already!

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.662
This is when I'm meant to give you
the speech about what you've done,

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.345
but I'm not going to.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.785
I'm fed up with speeches.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.351
Copy that, Clive.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.382
This place is filled
with miserable bastards,

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.383
but let me tell you something.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.224
You're different.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.542
And don't you let
anyone tell you otherwise.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.429
Yeah, life may seem shit
at the moment.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:24.744
If may feel like
the whole world's against you.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.063
But this is where you decide
what kind of person you are.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.224
What type of man you become
is down to you.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.065
And only you.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.303
I'm sure it will be any minute now.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.185
Yeah, OK.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.549
She's playing with me.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.463
She knows I hate waiting.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.984
Sorry I lost my cool.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.147
Oh.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.144
You see? I'm smiling.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.586
I'm happy-

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.706
Ah, here we fucking go.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.624
'It's a year today since he massacred
those innocent children.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.351
'The authorities are warning people
to stay inside.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.141
'The Piper is said to be mid-20s
and look just like one of us.'

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.069
What the fuck do you want?

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.827
I knew this guy in Pennsylvania.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.150
He was a real bitch.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.503
He made himself a target.

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.660
Of course, he didn't do anything about it
so they beat the fucking shit out of him.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:55.669
He was a nice guy.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.471
One dey, the motherfucker
just snapped.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.263
Killed every single one of them.

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.869
I respect you for trying.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.902
But you're just not good enough.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.789
You're not capable.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.827
You're a daddy-long-legs.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.582
But it's OK,

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.663
cos I'm here now.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.429
- Morning, Jim.
- Morning.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.789
Copy, Clive.
I could easily jump off here.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.862
All right'!

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.186
Not bad, aye.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.389
I'm sorry I punched you in the face.

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.750
I'm sorry I called you a freak.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.663
Not sorry I kissed Jackie, though.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.944
- Me neither. Pretty good, right?
- Yeah, pretty good.

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.063
- I thought your mum threw that out.
- No, I lied.

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:22.302
- What are you doing now, then?
- Urn... Don't know.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.144
Are you Roger?

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.862
- Are you Roger's brother'?
- No.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.589
Have you got a lighter?

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.429
Have you got a lighter?

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.905
Are you Roger?

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.501
No.

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.146
No.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:31.189
Are you Rogers brother?

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.229
Are you Roger?

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:47.820
No.

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.183
Are you Roger?

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.949
No, I'm Jim.
