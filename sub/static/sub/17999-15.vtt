WEBVTT

00:02.138 --> 00:04.050
Greatest american hero.

00:04.051 --> 00:06.912
A joke or a real superhero?

00:06.913 --> 00:09.735
- No. Not a real hero.
- Why?

00:09.736 --> 00:13.539
Never figured out
how to use his powers--

00:13.540 --> 00:15.037
Yeah, he lost the
manuals, right?

00:15.038 --> 00:18.776
So what? He has a suit
that allowed him to fly,

00:18.777 --> 00:20.288
super strength,
bullet proof.

00:20.289 --> 00:21.989
He never did
anything with it.

00:21.990 --> 00:23.490
But he was a
relocked hero, tho.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.091
That's what the
charm was.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.757
It's not the suit
that makes a hero.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.058
But what you do, right?

00:28.059 --> 00:29.859
Well, if the suitcase
is your power, it is.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.445
- Yeah, exactly!
- [laughter]

01:08.239 --> 01:09.339
Hello,
and welcome back

01:09.373 --> 01:11.391
To another episode
of Comic Book Men,

01:11.425 --> 01:12.976
The only show
that's terrified

01:13.010 --> 01:14.728
Of running into
our own doppelgangers.

01:14.762 --> 01:15.979
I'm your host,
Kevin Smith.

01:16.013 --> 01:17.914
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:17.948 --> 01:19.416
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:19.450 --> 01:20.850
So what's been going on
this week?

01:20.885 --> 01:22.152
You should have seen
this guy that came in.

01:22.186 --> 01:23.520
It was hilarious.

01:23.554 --> 01:26.790
He comes in, like,
almost like he's smuggling I

01:26.824 --> 01:28.191
Like, contraband.

01:28.225 --> 01:30.477
- Hey, what's up?
- How you doing?

01:30.528 --> 01:33.279
- What can I do for you today?
- I'm looking to sell this.

01:33.314 --> 01:34.864
Oh, yeah? Okay.

01:34.899 --> 01:38.234
Let me just jump on the other
side here for a second.

01:38.269 --> 01:40.136
All right,
what do we got?

01:40.171 --> 01:44.324
It is a Takara reissue
of the 1984 Megatron toy

01:44.358 --> 01:45.775
From Transformers.

01:52.850 --> 01:54.367
So the reason why
this thing is so cool

01:54.418 --> 01:57.370
Is that you will never be able
to buy this in a toy store

01:57.421 --> 01:59.355
Because there's these laws
that state

01:59.390 --> 02:01.224
You can't actually
sell a toy gun

02:01.258 --> 02:02.758
That looks like
a real gun.

02:02.777 --> 02:05.361
Now, if you mail-ordered
this from these internet sites,

02:05.396 --> 02:06.896
They had to cut
the box open

02:06.931 --> 02:09.499
And insert a blaze orange plug
into the barrel.

02:09.532 --> 02:12.085
If you buy it as a retailer,
can you not sell it then?

02:12.136 --> 02:14.137
Yeah. Wouldn't I get
in trouble trying to sell this?

02:14.171 --> 02:15.304
I think you should be okay.

02:15.322 --> 02:16.706
Well, we'll go
on his assumption

02:16.740 --> 02:17.941
That you won't
get in trouble.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.476
[laughter]

02:19.510 --> 02:21.678
There is always a market
for banned toys.

02:21.712 --> 02:22.745
Oh, yeah.

02:22.780 --> 02:24.114
The freddie krueger doll,
remember?

02:24.148 --> 02:26.416
Pulled from the toy shelves
because people were like,

02:26.450 --> 02:28.985
"he's your favorite
mass-murdering psycho."

02:29.019 --> 02:30.720
[laughs]
oh, they wrote that on the box?

02:30.738 --> 02:32.505
[laughing] yeah.
He didn't look that evil.

02:32.556 --> 02:35.191
He almost looked like a
cabbage patch kid on a bad day.

02:35.226 --> 02:39.996
[laughter]

02:40.030 --> 02:41.731
What are you looking
to get for it today?

02:41.765 --> 02:43.433
$250.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.502
What'd you buy it for?

02:45.536 --> 02:46.903
I bought it for 80.

02:46.937 --> 02:48.254
- 80 bucks?
- 80 bucks.

02:48.289 --> 02:49.539
But I mean, the thing is,
you know,

02:49.557 --> 02:51.908
I kind of had to know a guy
who knows a guy.

02:51.942 --> 02:53.676
I kind of felt like
I was buying illegal drugs,

02:53.710 --> 02:55.745
'cause I had to go up
to this guy's hotel room and,

02:55.779 --> 02:57.413
You know,
do the transaction, and--

02:57.448 --> 02:59.315
- It was like
a nerdy russian arms dealer.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.084
[laughter]

03:01.118 --> 03:02.485
I'll give you
100 bucks for it.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.887
You kidding me?

03:03.921 --> 03:05.388
- No.
- This is unplugged.

03:05.422 --> 03:07.507
- [laughs]
- The--the plugged versions

03:07.558 --> 03:08.591
Aren't even going
for 100 bucks.

03:08.626 --> 03:09.859
- Is this it?
- Oh, yeah.

03:09.893 --> 03:11.094
Yeah, yeah, it is.

03:11.128 --> 03:13.897
Brother, I could buy it
right now for a buck 30.

03:13.931 --> 03:15.465
But that's
a different megatron.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.833
That one
is colored black.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.868
Oh, a racist,
as well as a criminal.

03:18.902 --> 03:20.003
- [laughs]
- All right.

03:20.037 --> 03:22.639
I am not a racist. That is--
[laughter]

03:22.673 --> 03:25.341
That's an inaccurate portrayal
of Megatron.

03:25.359 --> 03:27.577
He was silver in the cartoon,
not black.

03:27.611 --> 03:28.911
Me and walt
don't see color.

03:28.929 --> 03:30.947
It wouldn't matter to us
what color he was.

03:30.981 --> 03:32.949
In all intense purposes,
it would be illegal

03:32.983 --> 03:34.450
To sell this in the stash,
wouldn't it?

03:34.485 --> 03:36.336
Yeah, I mean,
without the tip on it--

03:36.370 --> 03:37.720
- But then I'm thinking,
like, "hey, man,

03:37.755 --> 03:40.206
We get to be known that
we're selling underground toys."

03:40.241 --> 03:41.857
It's kind of, like,
street cred, though.

03:41.876 --> 03:42.909
- [laughs]
- That's true. Suddenly,

03:42.960 --> 03:44.527
We have an edge
that we don't have.

03:44.562 --> 03:46.563
[laughter]

03:46.597 --> 03:48.481
120, and--

03:48.532 --> 03:51.401
- We don't call the police
on you after you leave.

03:51.435 --> 03:52.802
- No, I can't do it.
- No?

03:52.836 --> 03:54.270
I'm losing on this.
I got the unplugged version.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.506
No, you're not.
You told us you paid 80 for it.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.908
- 120 is the top that I can do.
- That's the top?

03:58.943 --> 04:02.045
Yeah.

04:03.414 --> 04:05.281
I think I gotta
hold onto it.

04:05.316 --> 04:06.683
Yeah, you gonna
hold onto it?

04:06.717 --> 04:09.335
I just don't know
how long I'd be sitting on it

04:09.370 --> 04:11.654
And what kind of headaches
it'd bring me, you know,

04:11.672 --> 04:14.190
- Putting it on the shelf.
- Fair enough.

04:14.224 --> 04:15.575
Like,
ming starts playing with it,

04:15.626 --> 04:18.293
Somebody gets the wrong idea,
they gun him down.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.730
I can't have ming's blood
on my hands.

04:20.764 --> 04:21.848
Nah.

04:21.899 --> 04:22.965
- I'm sorry, sir.
- All right, well,

04:22.983 --> 04:24.234
- Thanks anyway, guys.
- All right, man.

04:24.268 --> 04:26.502
- Thanks.
- All right, have a good day.

04:29.073 --> 04:32.141
Was there ever
a neater resolution

04:32.176 --> 04:35.378
To a romantic triangle
than Gwen Stacy,

04:35.412 --> 04:38.047
Peter Parker,
Mary Jane Watson?

04:38.082 --> 04:39.349
Okay, I don't know
if I'd call that neat,

04:39.383 --> 04:40.883
One of them being
thrown off a bridge,

04:40.918 --> 04:44.254
Snapping her neck while
said hero tries to save her.

04:44.288 --> 04:46.923
Worked itself out nicely.
[laughter]

04:46.957 --> 04:48.908
It was gwen stacy,
and who was the other one?

04:48.943 --> 04:50.126
Mary Jane Watson.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.596
Gwen was the epitome
of the girl next door,

04:53.631 --> 04:56.816
An angel in go-go boots.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.818
- Really?
- Uh, you're forgetting

04:58.852 --> 05:01.304
The retconning
of Gwen Stacy, though.

05:01.322 --> 05:03.189
Oh.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.407
- What happened?
- I don't really count that.

05:04.441 --> 05:05.742
There was a period where

05:05.776 --> 05:07.977
Gwen was absent
from Spider-Man's life.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.479
She went to london
to figure stuff out

05:09.513 --> 05:10.897
After her father died.

05:10.948 --> 05:13.066
She was seduced
by Norman Osborne...

05:13.117 --> 05:14.884
- The Green Goblin.
- The Green Goblin,

05:14.918 --> 05:16.602
- Was carrying his babies.
- "Babies"?

05:16.637 --> 05:18.387
Yeah,
she was having twins.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.239
She cheated
on peter parker

05:20.274 --> 05:22.742
With Peter Parker's
greatest enemy.

05:22.776 --> 05:24.093
So wait a second.

05:24.128 --> 05:25.428
Then the Green Goblin
threw her off the bridge.

05:25.462 --> 05:26.679
- Yeah.
- Yes.

05:26.714 --> 05:28.831
So he killed the mother
of his Goblin babies?

05:28.849 --> 05:30.266
- Yes.
- Wow.

05:30.301 --> 05:32.502
Why was that not in the movies?
That's awesome.

05:32.536 --> 05:34.671
[laughter]

05:34.705 --> 05:36.939
Hi, I called you
about the George Perez sketch.

05:36.974 --> 05:38.975
Yes. Oh, wow.

05:39.009 --> 05:42.211
He's arguably the greatest
living comic book artist.

05:46.588 --> 05:47.989
Superman
has kryptonite,

05:48.023 --> 05:49.457
The only thing
that can kill him.

05:49.491 --> 05:51.225
- What's your kryptonite?
- I don't know.

05:51.260 --> 05:54.028
I don't--I mean, maybe if they
held your family hostage.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.279
Like, that's not really
kryptonite though,

05:55.314 --> 05:57.331
That's anybody.
I think a woman.

05:57.365 --> 05:58.466
Like, a beautiful woman.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.501
Like, sometimes,
when I'm in the store,

06:00.519 --> 06:02.002
A beautiful woman wants,
like, a discount,

06:02.020 --> 06:05.440
And you're not here, I've--
[laughter]

06:05.474 --> 06:06.657
I've been known to hit
the 10% off button.

06:06.692 --> 06:08.025
You're admitting to me
right now,

06:08.076 --> 06:10.645
If somebody comes in
who's semi-attractive,

06:10.679 --> 06:12.713
You're willing
to give them a discount?

06:12.731 --> 06:14.098
I think
his real kryptonite

06:14.149 --> 06:17.018
Are simple questions
that elicit stupidity.

06:17.052 --> 06:18.186
[laughter]

06:18.220 --> 06:19.787
Why would you ever
tell him that?

06:19.822 --> 06:20.988
[laughter]

06:21.023 --> 06:22.990
You guys ever wonder
what my kryptonite is?

06:22.991 --> 06:25.693
I mean, high prices
and obnoxious customers?

06:25.727 --> 06:27.028
I don't know.
Whats it?

06:27.062 --> 06:28.362
I don't know
if I have a kryptonite.

06:28.397 --> 06:30.565
There's nothing
that can stop you.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.467
[laughte

06:32.501 --> 06:34.902
That's awfully modest.
[laughter]

06:39.808 --> 06:41.609
So anthony,
what's the one piece

06:41.643 --> 06:43.211
That you're always
hunting for?

06:43.245 --> 06:45.513
The Avengers 4 cover.
No doubt about it.

06:45.547 --> 06:47.765
That's where they reintroduce
Captain America.

06:47.816 --> 06:49.350
It's just
the most iconic image.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.986
And it is the Moby Dick,
because it's not known to exist.

06:54.723 --> 06:55.690
Does that exist?

06:55.724 --> 06:56.791
- Probably not.
- No.

06:56.825 --> 06:57.792
Hey, guys,
how are you doing?

06:57.826 --> 06:58.943
- How you doing?
- I'm Vince.

06:58.994 --> 07:00.328
I called you about
the George Perez sketch.

07:00.362 --> 07:01.696
- Yes.
- All right.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.064
- Let me show it to you.
- Perez sketch?

07:03.098 --> 07:04.131
This is a treat.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.467
- There you go.
- Oh, wow.

07:06.501 --> 07:08.936
- Oh, my goodness.
- Prince Namor.

07:15.944 --> 07:17.378
And you're looking
to move it today?

07:17.412 --> 07:18.412
I'm looking to move it.

07:18.446 --> 07:19.580
All right,
this is anthony.

07:19.615 --> 07:20.982
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Hey.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.501
Anthony is one of the biggest
original comic book art dealers.

07:23.552 --> 07:25.653
I asked him here today
to look at your piece

07:25.687 --> 07:27.188
And give us
his expert opinion on it.

07:27.222 --> 07:28.356
Very good.

07:28.390 --> 07:31.592
It's from
my first comic book convention,

07:31.627 --> 07:34.161
And when I saw George Perez,
he was sketching out sketches,

07:34.196 --> 07:35.329
And he was doing it
for free.

07:35.364 --> 07:36.814
Why'd you pick
the sub-mariner?

07:36.865 --> 07:38.966
Everybody would get Superman.
Everybody would get Batman.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.418
Everybody would get Thor.

07:40.469 --> 07:43.971
Let me pick somebody else
that you don't see every day.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.308
- So you've had this since 1975?
- Since 1975.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.776
Wow.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.829
George Perez went on
to become one of the most

07:51.863 --> 07:55.983
Influential, dynamic artists
in comic book history,

07:56.018 --> 07:59.153
And still is one of the top-tier
pencillers in the industry.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.923
Your husband, george perez.
[laughter]

08:01.957 --> 08:04.242
Walter Flanagan
loves George Perez.

08:04.293 --> 08:05.876
You've always been in love
with his art, man.

08:05.911 --> 08:07.662
Oh, yeah.
I mean, his art just--

08:07.696 --> 08:10.231
Like, it touches
a lobe in my brain.

08:10.265 --> 08:11.999
I don't know if that lobe
is in your brain.

08:12.034 --> 08:16.504
It touches you some other--
[laughter]

08:16.538 --> 08:18.372
All right, anthony,
what do you think?

08:18.407 --> 08:21.342
It's fun, because it puts it
in a--in a time and place

08:21.376 --> 08:23.878
Where george was pretty new
in his career.

08:23.912 --> 08:25.746
I mean,
in the early '70s, '75,

08:25.764 --> 08:27.014
He was kind of
just starting out.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.449
He hadn't really
hit his stride.

08:28.483 --> 08:31.719
By the mid-'80s, he's, like,
an industry superstar.

08:31.753 --> 08:33.821
I think he's arguably

08:33.855 --> 08:35.823
The greatest living
comic book artist.

08:35.857 --> 08:39.510
Considering it's a young,
wide-eyed george perez,

08:39.561 --> 08:42.530
What kind of money
would this piece command?

08:42.563 --> 08:45.866
On a retail level,
I'd put it around $250.

08:45.901 --> 08:49.971
All right, so what were you
looking to get for it today?

08:50.005 --> 08:52.940
$200.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.144
Could you do $175?

08:57.179 --> 08:59.113
Uh...

09:02.784 --> 09:04.986
- Yeah, $175 is good.
- $175 is good?

09:05.020 --> 09:06.320
- Sure.
- All right, man,

09:09.124 --> 09:11.125
Thank you
for bringing this in, man.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.393
We'll cherish it.
Thanks, guys.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.394
Take care.
- You're welcome.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.430
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Bye-bye.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.502
Would you ever take a job
working for a supervillain?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.270
You know, it could be anybody.
Pick one.

09:23.305 --> 09:24.639
Ooh, I wouldn't want to work
for the Joker.

09:24.673 --> 09:25.806
It's too risky.
- No.

09:25.841 --> 09:28.075
See, I think I would
work for the joker.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.477
Every day
is gonna be different.

09:29.511 --> 09:32.179
- No, he'd probably kill you.
- Yeah.

09:32.214 --> 09:33.664
- [laughs]
- What about, like, Catwoman?

09:33.699 --> 09:35.983
What if the boss is a she?- Ik

09:36.018 --> 09:37.234
My wife would let me
work for Catwoman.

09:37.269 --> 09:39.003
[scoffs]
yeah?

09:39.054 --> 09:40.137
[laughter]

09:40.172 --> 09:43.357
She should be nervous.
[laughter]

09:43.392 --> 09:45.693
"I don't know if catwoman
could keep her claws off me."

09:45.727 --> 09:48.829
[laughter]

09:48.864 --> 09:51.432
I'm looking for the first
appearance of Batgirl.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.466
Here it is.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.402
Very key issue
from the silver age.

09:54.436 --> 09:55.703
We play
comic book charades.

09:55.737 --> 09:57.204
Monster.
- Zombie.

09:57.239 --> 09:59.073
- Poop.
- [laughs]

10:00.800 --> 10:03.218
What's your favorite lair in
the world of comics or movies?

10:03.252 --> 10:08.223
Honeycomb hideout.
[lghter]

10:08.274 --> 10:09.841
That was
a cool hideout.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.344
I love the Baxter Building,
you know, 'cause it's, like--

10:12.378 --> 10:14.362
Not only did it have
really badass stuff,

10:14.397 --> 10:15.397
Like a negative zone

10:15.448 --> 10:17.449
And, you know,
different floors,

10:17.483 --> 10:19.901
But it also felt
like it was a home.

10:19.936 --> 10:21.086
What about
Avenger's mansion?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.155
- I mean, that's a mansion.
- There you go.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.475
Marvel had a way of making
their superheroes' hideouts

10:26.509 --> 10:30.295
Feel like it was homey,
but yet still badass.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.214
- And dc doesn't do that?
- Dc, I think,

10:32.265 --> 10:34.799
Tends to go for a little bit
more sterile, uh--

10:34.817 --> 10:37.169
- Sterile, solitary.
- Yeah.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.771
Fortress of solitude,
it doesn't feel like a home.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.239
Batcave
doesn't feel like home.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.975
Yeah, you guys do realize,
this is our lair, right?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.677
I mean, this is the closest
we're ever gonna get

10:45.711 --> 10:46.962
To a superhero base.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.548
Like it or love it, this is it,
so you better love it.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.816
- I love it.
- All right.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.768
I nearly destroyed poker table
with crumbs all over it.

10:53.803 --> 10:55.053
[laughter]

10:55.087 --> 10:58.089
I feel like a superhero.

11:04.512 --> 11:08.048
You know, you got
yourSuperman, your Batman.

11:08.082 --> 11:10.299
They mostly live up
to the hype, right?

11:10.317 --> 11:13.737
There's got to be superheroes
that--they're just overrated.

11:13.771 --> 11:15.972
I'm going out on a limb here.
Fantastic Four.

11:16.007 --> 11:16.973
- All of 'em?
- Wow.

11:17.008 --> 11:19.342
Yeah.
[laughter]

11:19.377 --> 11:23.813
Without the fantastic four,
there is no Marvel universe.

11:23.848 --> 11:25.932
They became huge
based off the hit

11:25.983 --> 11:27.150
That the Fantastic Four
became.

11:27.184 --> 11:28.685
And they've been coasting
ever since.

11:28.719 --> 11:30.720
Ahoh!

11:30.755 --> 11:32.522
Give me somebody else.

11:32.556 --> 11:33.790
Supergirl.

11:33.824 --> 11:36.092
She's overrated
because of her good looks.

11:36.127 --> 11:37.860
That's what
she's coasting on.

11:37.878 --> 11:40.730
Like, if I was good-looking,
I could strap on a cape.

11:40.765 --> 11:42.899
Everybody would respect me,
right?

11:42.917 --> 11:45.285
Ah, you dropped
the "Chuluthu."

11:45.319 --> 11:46.453
- Do it.
- Come on.

11:46.487 --> 11:48.104
Do it.

11:48.122 --> 11:51.558
[laughter]

11:56.680 --> 11:58.014
All right,
have a great afternoon.

11:58.049 --> 11:59.132
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, man.

11:59.183 --> 12:00.600
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:00.651 --> 12:02.402
I'm actually here
looking for

12:02.436 --> 12:04.020
The first appearance
of Batgirl.

12:04.055 --> 12:05.221
We do have that.

12:05.256 --> 12:06.723
Ming, could you
do me a favor and grab

12:06.757 --> 12:09.059
The detective, first appearance
of Batgirl, please?

12:09.093 --> 12:10.927
Yeah,
what number is that?

12:10.961 --> 12:13.329
- 359.
- 359.

12:13.364 --> 12:15.348
Nice that she has to tell you
your business, Ming.

12:15.382 --> 12:17.467
[laughter]

12:17.501 --> 12:18.835
Thanks.

12:18.853 --> 12:22.539
Okay, there it is.
359.

12:29.346 --> 12:30.713
Finally.
Nice to be able to hold it.

12:30.748 --> 12:32.849
[laughs]
- So who was Batgirl?

12:32.883 --> 12:34.300
Do you know
what was the actress's name?

12:34.351 --> 12:35.552
I don't know,
I can't remember.

12:35.586 --> 12:36.820
- What was the actress's name?
- Yvonne Craig.

12:36.854 --> 12:38.387
- Yvonne--
- Oh, my goodness.

12:38.405 --> 12:39.589
[laughs]

12:39.607 --> 12:41.958
I'm sorry.
Can you guys switch places, man?

12:41.992 --> 12:45.228
[laughter]
this is too much! Look.

12:45.262 --> 12:47.213
It's too much to bear.

12:47.248 --> 12:49.599
- Big Batgirl fan?
- I am.

12:49.633 --> 12:51.117
Actually, what had happened
that made me

12:51.168 --> 12:52.702
Want to get this issue

12:52.736 --> 12:54.437
Was I had surgery
a couple years ago.

12:54.472 --> 12:55.989
Everything turned out
to be okay,

12:56.023 --> 12:57.807
But it was
a little bit of a scare,

12:57.842 --> 13:00.476
And I was basically
under house arrest

13:00.494 --> 13:02.362
For about a month.
I couldn't do anything,

13:02.413 --> 13:04.013
So I picked up
my old comics.

13:04.048 --> 13:06.749
I found that
I really related to Batgirl.

13:06.784 --> 13:07.817
Bry, you probably
know Batgirl

13:07.852 --> 13:09.419
From the television show,
right?

13:09.453 --> 13:10.620
- Yeah.
- Remember,

13:10.654 --> 13:14.207
She was a nerdy librarian,
wore the glasses.

13:14.258 --> 13:16.543
Came off...
The hair comes down.

13:16.594 --> 13:18.094
[laughter]

13:18.128 --> 13:20.530
Just like that, right?
That was good.

13:20.564 --> 13:24.334
I loved watching
the Batman TV show

13:24.368 --> 13:26.970
And waiting to see--
in the credits sequence,

13:27.004 --> 13:28.388
You could tell
whether it was gonna be

13:28.422 --> 13:29.923
A Batgirl episode
or not.

13:29.974 --> 13:31.975
Yes! Yes.
[laughter]

13:32.009 --> 13:35.945
Prepubescent sexuality
channeled by sitting there

13:35.979 --> 13:39.315
Waiting for the appearance
of the Batgirl cartoon cycle

13:39.350 --> 13:42.652
To go through the frame,
and you were like, "ohh!"

13:42.686 --> 13:43.887
[laughter]
I don't know how to channel it.

13:43.921 --> 13:48.091
Ah! It's happening to me!
[laughter]

13:48.125 --> 13:51.194
Very key issue
from the silver age.

13:51.228 --> 13:52.996
The introduction
of a major character

13:53.030 --> 13:54.631
That's still a major character
to this day.

13:54.665 --> 13:58.468
We're looking
to get 375.

13:58.502 --> 14:01.387
I was hoping, you know,
for maybe 200.

14:01.422 --> 14:03.056
No?

14:03.090 --> 14:06.509
First Barbara Gordon
in the bat costume,

14:06.544 --> 14:07.694
With her bat purse,

14:07.745 --> 14:09.279
Which she doesn't
really carry anymore,

14:09.313 --> 14:10.313
I don't believe.

14:10.347 --> 14:13.016
I could do...360.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.535
325?

14:15.569 --> 14:17.720
340.

14:17.755 --> 14:19.622
[inhales]
Oh.

14:19.657 --> 14:21.424
All right, I--
- 340?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.558
- I'll take it.
- Yeah?

14:22.576 --> 14:24.160
Your story
should have been way sadder.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.329
[laughter]

14:26.363 --> 14:28.831
Now, in a negotiation instance
like this, where you have

14:28.866 --> 14:31.184
Somebody that's coming in
with a sympathetic tale,

14:31.235 --> 14:35.371
It sounds like, does that
affect how you negotiate?

14:35.406 --> 14:36.990
There's no way
it cannot affect you.

14:37.024 --> 14:39.776
And you hear a story like that,
you're a little bit more apt

14:39.810 --> 14:43.880
To maybe deal a little bit more
than you would

14:43.914 --> 14:45.381
With the average
healthy person.

14:45.416 --> 14:46.983
You did
the right thing.

14:47.017 --> 14:49.052
If by "the right thing,"
you mean less than 10% off,

14:49.086 --> 14:51.821
Then yes.
[laughter]

14:56.527 --> 14:57.727
Is there any chance
I could leave early today?

14:57.761 --> 14:59.212
What,
you have nothing to do?

14:59.246 --> 15:01.030
There's no one in here.
I got everything done.

15:01.065 --> 15:02.882
All right, then we play
comic book charades.

15:02.917 --> 15:04.534
All right?

15:04.568 --> 15:05.685
- All right.
- Got one?

15:05.736 --> 15:07.937
Uh, yeah,
I think I got one.

15:07.971 --> 15:09.188
- All right, let's see it.
- Everybody's playing?

15:09.240 --> 15:11.808
Yeah, we'll all play.
Do it up.

15:11.842 --> 15:13.509
All right, ready?

15:13.544 --> 15:15.712
- One.
- One word.

15:15.746 --> 15:16.746
Daredevil.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.782
- Oh, my God.
- That was it?

15:19.817 --> 15:21.251
You should have just
let him go home early.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.620
[laughter]

15:23.654 --> 15:25.054
- Two words.
- Okay.

15:25.089 --> 15:27.190
First word.

15:27.224 --> 15:28.925
- Silent.
- Silence.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.343
The shadow.

15:30.394 --> 15:32.061
Second word.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.629
- The punisher.
- Shooting.

15:33.647 --> 15:35.698
War. Secret war.

15:35.733 --> 15:37.900
- Booya!
- Got it.

15:37.935 --> 15:39.869
Crisis on Infinite Earths.

15:39.903 --> 15:41.271
I love how Mike
gets into it.

15:41.305 --> 15:42.572
- Universe.
- World.

15:42.606 --> 15:44.824
All: World.

15:44.858 --> 15:46.025
- You.
- Present.

15:46.076 --> 15:48.244
The second world?
The second word now? Okay.

15:48.279 --> 15:49.779
- Patriotic.
- Patriotic.

15:49.797 --> 15:51.464
Captain America.

15:51.498 --> 15:53.316
Um, I don't know
what you're doing there.

15:53.350 --> 15:55.084
You're just posing weird.
[laughs]

15:55.119 --> 15:58.254
- First word was "world."
- Okay, "world."

15:58.272 --> 15:59.455
World's Finest.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.224
Oh!

16:01.258 --> 16:03.076
- One word. One word. One word.
- It's only one word.

16:03.127 --> 16:04.894
Heaven?

16:04.928 --> 16:07.397
[whispering]
Sky.

16:08.449 --> 16:10.133
- Monster.
- Frankenstein.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.901
Monster.

16:11.935 --> 16:12.969
- Dance.
- Dance?

16:13.003 --> 16:13.970
- Poop.
- Fish.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.238
- Tail.
- Fish. Tail.

16:15.272 --> 16:16.406
- Tail.
- Tail?

16:16.440 --> 16:17.840
Wow, we really could
play this all night.

16:17.858 --> 16:19.175
[laughs]

16:19.209 --> 16:20.243
- Godzilla.
- Tyrannosaurus.

16:20.277 --> 16:21.844
- Godzilla?
- Yeah.

16:21.879 --> 16:22.845
- Oh, "god," oh.
- Up from the depths.

16:22.863 --> 16:24.247
Heaven, god.

16:24.281 --> 16:25.481
All right, I guess
it's time to go home now.

16:25.515 --> 16:28.084
- [laughs]
- Let's get out of here.

16:28.118 --> 16:30.186
That's the most sought-after
monster model kit.

16:30.220 --> 16:31.871
Oh.

16:35.930 --> 16:37.230
What do you guys think?

16:37.265 --> 16:39.032
Who is more powerful,

16:39.067 --> 16:40.400
Heat miser
or snow miser?

16:40.435 --> 16:42.169
Is that, uh,
Year Without a Santa Claus?

16:42.203 --> 16:43.170
Very good.

16:43.204 --> 16:44.471
Um...

16:44.505 --> 16:46.540
I mean,
from what I remember,

16:46.574 --> 16:48.241
Heat miser was
a little more badass.

16:48.276 --> 16:49.843
He was, like,
angry all the time, right?

16:49.877 --> 16:51.645
I think he would lose
to snow miser, though...

16:51.679 --> 16:52.979
- Why?
- 'Cause snow miser was

16:53.014 --> 16:57.217
Just as evil,
but calculating.

16:57.251 --> 16:59.553
Cold--pardon the pun--
cold and calculating.

16:59.587 --> 17:03.523
He wasn't given to emotion
like heat miser was so much.

17:03.558 --> 17:04.808
So this would be,
like, a civil war.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.176
- Brother versus brother battle.
- Minus the slavery.

17:07.211 --> 17:10.230
[laughter]

17:15.002 --> 17:17.404
- What's up, guys?
- Hey, monster bill, man!

17:17.438 --> 17:19.071
- How you been?
- All right, walt, how are you?

17:19.107 --> 17:20.073
Good.

17:20.108 --> 17:21.307
Hey, this is monster Bill, Bry.

17:21.325 --> 17:22.309
- Monster Bill.
- How are you doing?

17:22.343 --> 17:23.742
- How are you?
- Good, good.

17:23.761 --> 17:24.795
- What's going on?
- That's your christian name,

17:24.846 --> 17:27.180
- I assume?
- How are you, my friend?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.281
An old fried of mine--

17:28.299 --> 17:29.616
His name is monster Bill--
came in.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.651
Since when do you know a guy
named monster Bill?

17:31.686 --> 17:32.636
[laughter]

17:32.670 --> 17:34.387
Since when is he your friend?

17:34.422 --> 17:35.522
Yeah. [laughter]

17:35.556 --> 17:36.773
Could you just say
"acquaintanceship"?

17:36.824 --> 17:38.191
Why does it bug you, though,

17:38.226 --> 17:40.193
That he's friends
with somebody that's not you?

17:40.228 --> 17:42.496
Because he has nothing
to base it on,

17:42.530 --> 17:43.930
Aside from running into a guy
at flea markets.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.265
And he's like,
"oh, this is us now."

17:45.299 --> 17:48.235
Never made a nickname up for me.
Come on, "lazy Bry."

17:48.269 --> 17:49.469
[laughter]

17:49.504 --> 17:51.471
What brings you in here today?

17:51.506 --> 17:53.740
Well, I'm dwindling down
my collection.

17:53.775 --> 17:55.975
I have a bride of Frankenstein
aurora model kit,

17:55.993 --> 17:57.344
And it's rare.

17:57.378 --> 17:58.444
Let's see it.

17:58.463 --> 17:59.613
Oh, wow.

17:59.647 --> 18:02.349
Is is what
gets my heart pumping.

18:09.524 --> 18:11.424
This is rare, huh?

18:11.459 --> 18:14.511
Yeah, 'cause that's the most
sought-after monster model kit.

18:14.545 --> 18:16.162
Open it up. Let's check it out.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.831
[laughter]

18:17.865 --> 18:19.866
All right, bill, what are you
looking to get for this?

18:19.901 --> 18:22.269
Well, I'm looking for,
like, 1,500.

18:22.303 --> 18:23.753
- Oh.
- [gasps]

18:23.805 --> 18:25.772
You've been huffing a lot of
model glue there, monster Bill.

18:25.807 --> 18:28.809
[laughs]

18:28.843 --> 18:30.710
Monster bill, what's
the lowest you'll take for this?

18:30.745 --> 18:33.263
I mean, that seems a little bit
out there for me today.

18:33.314 --> 18:35.381
I really hate to see it
go for less than that.

18:35.399 --> 18:37.184
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:37.218 --> 18:39.052
Come on, monster Bill,
you must have other stuff.

18:39.086 --> 18:40.537
I have my monster van
outside,

18:40.588 --> 18:43.056
And I have some stuff out there
you might be interested.

18:43.090 --> 18:44.958
You're telling me
you got a monster van?

18:44.992 --> 18:48.395
- Yes.
- I'm there. Let's go, man.

18:51.749 --> 18:53.733
Oh, my god.

18:56.404 --> 18:57.971
Imagine, if your van
looks like this,

18:58.005 --> 18:59.673
What's monster Bill's house
look like with all this mon--?

18:59.707 --> 19:04.611
- Like the exact same thing.
- [laughs]

19:04.645 --> 19:07.180
Well,
that looks familiar.

19:14.155 --> 19:15.789
You know,
seeing this,

19:15.823 --> 19:19.226
I'm thinking maybe it's time
to get back on the saddle.

19:19.260 --> 19:20.227
Yeah?

19:20.261 --> 19:21.828
In the early '90s,

19:21.863 --> 19:24.197
I had this grandiose idea
that I would build models,

19:24.215 --> 19:25.916
And I would become
the model maker of,

19:25.967 --> 19:27.200
You know, of the town.

19:27.235 --> 19:28.935
'cause doesn't he
get all the respect?

19:28.970 --> 19:32.772
[laughter]

19:32.807 --> 19:34.374
- I hated those models, man.
- Why?

19:34.408 --> 19:35.709
I was never
a big model guy,

19:35.743 --> 19:37.577
But, like, models were
kind of on the way out.

19:37.612 --> 19:38.812
Like, when I was younger,

19:38.846 --> 19:40.130
Star Wars figures
were on the way in.

19:40.181 --> 19:41.147
People were like, "I'm not
gonna look at something.

19:41.182 --> 19:42.148
I'm gonna play
with something."

19:42.182 --> 19:43.850
The models I liked
were the ones

19:43.885 --> 19:45.585
That just snapped together.
I hated the glue and the--

19:45.620 --> 19:46.920
- The lazy boy model, though.
- Of course.

19:46.954 --> 19:48.638
- The fat boy model, yes.
- [laughs]

19:48.689 --> 19:50.457
I don't want to put
any work into it.

19:50.491 --> 19:52.859
How much
you want for it?

19:52.894 --> 19:54.344
250.

19:54.378 --> 19:56.329
[laughs]
Why so greedy, monster Bill?

19:56.347 --> 19:57.664
[laughs]

19:57.698 --> 19:59.399
How about 150?

19:59.433 --> 20:02.769
- Come on, monster Bill.
- How about 200?

20:02.803 --> 20:04.404
200.

20:04.438 --> 20:07.390
175 bucks,

20:07.425 --> 20:09.442
And how about I let you
help me build the models?

20:09.477 --> 20:10.810
We'll put 'em all together.

20:10.845 --> 20:15.115
Oh, boy.
[sighs]

20:16.233 --> 20:17.517
You've been
a good friend.

20:17.535 --> 20:20.120
I'll let it go
for 175.

20:20.154 --> 20:21.454
And you'll help me
put it together?

20:21.489 --> 20:22.822
- Yes.
- You got a deal.

20:22.856 --> 20:24.157
All right.

20:24.191 --> 20:26.226
I'm not kidding around.
No, he agreed to that.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.961
And you know what?
We put that model together.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.229
[laughing]
stop it. Did you?

20:29.263 --> 20:30.964
Yeah,
and it looks snapping.

20:30.998 --> 20:32.966
[laughter]

20:33.000 --> 20:36.970
Now, I know you're just
trying to bug him at this point.

20:37.004 --> 20:38.939
- It's ridiculous, man.
- It is.

20:38.973 --> 20:40.173
'Cause this is the dude
who's just like,

20:40.191 --> 20:41.674
"I hate everybody,"
and sudden, it's like,

20:41.692 --> 20:43.410
"Come on, monster Bill."

20:43.444 --> 20:44.678
[laughter]

20:44.712 --> 20:46.646
What a bummer, man.
End of the show.

20:46.681 --> 20:49.049
That's gonna do it for another
episode of Comic Book Men.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.850
Until next week,
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:50.885 --> 20:52.418
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:52.436 --> 20:54.020
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:54.055 --> 20:56.740
We're all just running
on that cosmic treadmill, kids.

20:56.791 --> 20:58.792
Good night.
