UH...5 OR 6? AND YOU AND DADDY

34:22.460 --> 34:26.453
HAD HAD THIS BIG FIGHT, AND YOU

34:26.460 --> 34:28.621
TOOK ME BY THE HAND, AND YOU

34:28.630 --> 34:33.124
SAID, "LET'S GO, JULIA. WE'RE

34:33.130 --> 34:38.466
LEAVING." AND WE WENT OUTSIDE,

34:38.470 --> 34:41.871
AND WE JUST WALKED FOR A LONG

34:41.880 --> 34:45.372
TIME IN SILENCE, HOLDING HANDS.

[CH UCKLES]

34:53.290 --> 34:55.758

34:55.760 --> 34:57.910
OF GRASS IN-BETWEEN MY THUMBS

34:57.920 --> 35:01.458
AND BLOW ON IT TO MAKE A NOISE.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.826
AND HOW I LAUGHED AND...YOU TOOK

35:03.830 --> 35:06.367

35:06.370 --> 35:11.364
SAID, "I LOVE YOU, LITTLE GIRL."

35:11.370 --> 35:15.773
AND I SQUEEZED YOU SO TIGHT, AND

35:15.780 --> 35:19.375
I SAID, "I LOVE YOU, TOO,

35:19.380 --> 35:23.646
MOMMY." AND WE BOTH KNEW IT WAS

35:23.650 --> 35:28.258
TRUE. DO YOU REMEMBER?

35:40.470 --> 35:42.597
AND THEN ONE DAY...

35:42.600 --> 35:44.261
IT WASN'T TRUE ANYMORE.

35:49.340 --> 35:52.503
I FORGIVE YOU FOR NOT LOVING ME.

35:52.510 --> 35:56.276
IT'S OK. I DIDN'T LOVE YOU,

35:56.280 --> 36:05.951
EITHER. I JUST...CRAVED...
