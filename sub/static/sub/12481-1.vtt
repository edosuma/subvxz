02:17.930 --> 02:19.570
<i>~ From now on ~</i>

02:21.660 --> 02:25.650
<i>Okay, there are two things that</i>
<i>I remember about my childhood.</i>

02:25.820 --> 02:29.330
<i>I just don't remember it</i>
<i>being this orange.</i>

02:29.770 --> 02:32.860
<i>First, I remember being with my dad.</i>

02:32.960 --> 02:35.110
<i>He would get these</i>
<i>far-off looks in his eye,</i>

02:35.210 --> 02:36.610
<i>and he would say,</i>

02:36.710 --> 02:39.970
<i>"Life doesn't always turn out</i>
<i>the way you plan."</i>

02:40.660 --> 02:44.970
<i>I just wish I'd realized at the time</i>
<i>he was talking about my life.</i>

02:46.670 --> 02:50.040
<i>But that never stopped us</i>
<i>from taking our adventures together.</i>

02:50.140 --> 02:52.670
<i>He would pack up</i>
<i>our sometimes-working car,</i>

02:52.770 --> 02:57.240
<i>and he would tell me amazing stories</i>
<i>about strange and exotic lands</i>

02:57.340 --> 03:02.620
<i>as we headed off to exciting</i>
<i>destinations like Milwaukee.</i>

03:03.020 --> 03:06.700
<i>It's amazing how exotic Wisconsin... isn't.</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:09.570
<i>But my favorite memories</i>
<i>were the stories</i>

03:09.670 --> 03:11.940
<i>that he would tell me about my mom.</i>

03:12.040 --> 03:14.500
<i>He would take me to the church</i>
<i>where they got married,</i>

03:14.600 --> 03:17.410
<i>and I'd beg him to tell me more</i>
<i>about the ceremony</i>

03:17.510 --> 03:19.830
<i>and about my crazy Uncle Irwin,</i>

03:19.930 --> 03:22.970
<i>who fell asleep</i>
<i>in the macaroni and cheese.</i>

03:23.250 --> 03:28.400
<i>And I asked my dad when he</i>
<i>knew that he truly loved my mom.</i>

03:28.710 --> 03:33.820
<i>And he said to me, "Lucy,</i>
<i>your mother gave me a special gift.</i>

03:34.220 --> 03:36.240
<i>"She gave me the world."</i>

03:37.060 --> 03:39.520
<i>Actually it was a globe with a light in it.</i>

03:39.620 --> 03:43.120
<i>But for the romantic that he was,</i>
<i>it might as well have been the world.</i>

03:44.730 --> 03:47.020
<i>Well, the first time I saw him,</i>

03:47.120 --> 03:51.970
<i>he didn't exactly give me the world.</i>
<i>It was a dollar-fifty train token.</i>

03:52.070 --> 03:55.510
<i>But I looked forward to it</i>
<i>every single day.</i>

03:55.830 --> 04:00.120
<i>He started coming to my booth</i>
<i>between 8:01 and 8:15 every morning,</i>

04:00.220 --> 04:03.680
<i>Monday through Friday,</i>
<i>and he was just perfect.</i>

04:03.830 --> 04:05.270
<i>My Prince Charming.</i>

04:06.460 --> 04:11.260
<i>Well, we've never actually spoken,</i>
<i>but I know someday we will.</i>

04:11.360 --> 04:13.640
<i>I know it. I just know it.</i>

04:13.740 --> 04:17.600
<i>And I know that someday</i>
<i>I will find a way to introduce myself,</i>

04:17.700 --> 04:20.620
<i>and that's gonna be perfect.</i>

04:21.300 --> 04:23.040
<i>Just like my prince.</i>

04:29.910 --> 04:33.350
$45 for a Christmas tree
and they don't deliver?

04:33.450 --> 04:35.910
You order $10 worth of chow chow mein
from Mr. Wong's,

04:36.010 --> 04:38.180
they bring it to your door.

04:40.190 --> 04:43.040
I should've gotten the blue spruce.
They're lighter.

04:49.860 --> 04:50.960
Lucy!

04:52.980 --> 04:56.710
Nature of claim,
Christmas tree through window.

04:57.070 --> 04:58.710
How am I gonna put that on my insurance?

04:58.810 --> 05:00.490
They're still pissed
about the fire we had

05:00.590 --> 05:02.700
when Joe Jr. Barbecued in the stairwell.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.160
- I missed that one.
- Great sausage.

05:05.260 --> 05:08.640
- Look, I'll pay for this.
- That's okay, Lucy.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.130
My brother Julie's
in the glass business.

05:12.230 --> 05:16.650
I almost forgot.
Merry Christmas.

05:17.510 --> 05:19.410
Aw, Lucy.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.350
You didn't have to do that.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.930
Well, I wanted to.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.770
I haven't even gotten
to my shopping yet.

05:25.870 --> 05:27.150
Hey, Pop.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.650
Can I give that bottle of Blue Nun

05:28.750 --> 05:31.630
from cousin Ornella
to my probation officer?

05:31.730 --> 05:33.790
Can't you see
we got some company?

05:35.280 --> 05:38.090
- Say hello.
- Hello, Luce.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.010
Nice...

05:45.790 --> 05:47.490
Sweater.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.850
- Thank you.
- It's over there.

05:54.550 --> 05:59.150
Lucy, you're a nice girl.
Joe Jr.'s still single.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.780
Yeah, it's a shocker.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.440
What'll you have?

06:09.540 --> 06:12.130
- The usual.
- What's that?

06:12.860 --> 06:16.740
- Mustard, Coke.
- Lucy. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.700
- Hi, Jerry.
- I'm glad to find you here.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.540
I was hoping you'd find me in Bermuda.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.580
Bermuda?
That's good.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.420
I am recommending you
for Employee of the Month.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.890
The usual.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.420
Really? I didn't know there was
an Employee of the Month.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.570
Yeah.

06:32.340 --> 06:35.590
"Supervisor Jerry Wallace
nominates Lucy Moderatz

06:35.690 --> 06:37.740
"for Employee of the Month.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.770
"Lucy is never tardy,
always works holidays,

06:40.870 --> 06:43.310
"even if she has worked
the previous holiday.

06:43.410 --> 06:45.150
"Just because she worked Thanksgiving,

06:45.250 --> 06:47.440
"Lucy is willing to work Christmas, too."

06:47.540 --> 06:50.250
Jerry, I'm not working Christmas.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.330
You'll get a nice plaque
with the mayor's stamp on it.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.370
- I didn't vote.
- You get to ride on a float.

06:56.470 --> 06:57.950
- Saint Paddy's Day.
- I hate parades.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.000
Did I mention extra holiday pay?

07:00.100 --> 07:02.060
- I hate you.
- Lucy.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.130
Look, Violet is sick
and Celeste can't switch

07:07.230 --> 07:09.130
because she's got some big family thing.

07:09.230 --> 07:12.130
And I promised my kids
I'd be there for them this year.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.390
It stinks, Jerry.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.820
I know it isn't fair,
and I can't make you do it.

07:17.350 --> 07:19.770
But, Lucy, you're the only one...

07:19.870 --> 07:21.450
Without family.

07:34.890 --> 07:37.860

08:40.100 --> 08:41.370
You're beautiful.

08:41.470 --> 08:42.770
Will you marry me?

08:42.970 --> 08:44.450
I love you.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.280
- Hey.
- Nice coat.

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

09:06.690 --> 09:08.330
Somebody help me, please.

09:08.430 --> 09:10.370
Sir? Sir? Sir?

09:10.470 --> 09:14.560
Are you okay? Can you get up?
God, sir, this is not good.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.590
Oh, God, mister...
Can you... Are you breathing?

09:20.690 --> 09:24.350
Oh, God, you smell good.
Please wake up. Please, please.

09:24.450 --> 09:26.060
Oh, God.
Can you wake up?

09:26.160 --> 09:28.580
Can you hear me?

09:29.890 --> 09:31.590
Oh, God.

09:31.940 --> 09:34.360
Wake up. Somebody help me, please.

09:34.460 --> 09:37.110
Mister?
Mister?

09:37.210 --> 09:41.090
There's a train coming, and it's fast.
It's an express.

09:42.530 --> 09:43.840
Oh, God.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.440
Hi.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.470
- All right, bring him down here.
- I need a doctor here.

10:06.890 --> 10:09.270
<i>Dr. Stevens, Dr. Jessica Stevens...</i>

10:09.370 --> 10:10.810
Hi, excuse me.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.770
About two seconds ago,
a man was brought in...

10:12.870 --> 10:14.330
- What's his name?
- I don't know it.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.440
- I need to know his name.
- He's right there.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.800
You don't know his name?
Why don't you...

10:19.070 --> 10:20.830
- You can't go in.
- You can't go in there.

10:20.930 --> 10:22.990
- You don't understand.
- You family?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.050
- Family only.
- No, you don't understand.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.920
- I was...
- You wait there.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.980
Okay, guys, what do we got here?

10:34.420 --> 10:36.230
I was gonna marry him.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.570
Get Dr. Rubin
or Dr. Ortiz here.

10:49.270 --> 10:51.780
<i>Dr. Memrack to ICU West.</i>

10:51.880 --> 10:54.000
Come on, come with me.
Over here.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.970
- Let him hear your voice, hon.
- Okay.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.180
Hi.

11:15.340 --> 11:19.760
Everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
It's gonna be fine.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.050
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

11:21.150 --> 11:22.850
Is that the woman that saved his life?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.910
It gets even better than that.
She's his fiancée.

11:34.780 --> 11:36.400
Excuse me, ma'am.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.570
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you
a few questions.

11:38.670 --> 11:40.220
- Okay.
- Officer, may I interrupt you?

11:40.320 --> 11:42.450
- Sure. I'll be right over there.
- Thank you.

11:42.550 --> 11:44.250
- I'm Dr. Rubin.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

11:44.350 --> 11:46.320
Don't tell me about passes.
Where the hell is he?

11:46.420 --> 11:49.920
- Dad, don't embarrass me.
- He's so pale. Oh, my God.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.250
- What is this?
- This is my son. How is he?

11:52.350 --> 11:55.180
You can't come
bursting into this unit.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.050
- He'll be all right, right? Right?
- What happened? What's going on?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.140
- He's in a coma.
- On Christmas Day.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.260
Jesus.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.280
His vital signs are strong,
his brain waves are good.

12:04.380 --> 12:07.020
- Brain waves?
- He's going to get through this.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.290
- Are you a specialist?
- How did this happen?

12:09.650 --> 12:13.130
He was pushed from the platform
at the train station.

12:14.990 --> 12:16.410
Who's she?

12:16.510 --> 12:18.950
- She's his fiancée.
- His fiancée?

12:19.050 --> 12:20.740
- Yeah.
- Peter's fiancée?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.410
- Peter's engaged?
- Yeah, I thought...

12:22.510 --> 12:25.120
No, no, you don't understand.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.920
I mean,
he would have told us, right?

12:27.020 --> 12:28.130
Maybe he was busy.

12:28.230 --> 12:30.310
Too busy to tell his own mother
he's getting married?

12:30.410 --> 12:32.910
- Don't yell at him.
- I'm not yelling at him.

12:33.010 --> 12:35.670
- If only Jack were here.
- Grandma?

12:35.770 --> 12:38.260
- Is she okay?
- She's got a little heart problem.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.020
She's had three attacks already.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.540
They weren't attacks.
They were episodes.

12:44.020 --> 12:46.860
- Nothing wrong with her hearing.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.520
What is she doing in here?

12:48.620 --> 12:51.000
Hey, buddy, she saved his life.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.130
You saved his life?

12:53.490 --> 12:54.700
Yeah, yeah, but...

12:54.800 --> 12:57.030
I thought he was pushed
off a train platform.

12:57.130 --> 12:58.910
She jumped on the tracks.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.140
You jumped on the tracks?

13:01.620 --> 13:04.460
Doctor, it's supposed to be family only.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.100
- She is family.
- She's the fiancée, you idiot.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.920
- Look, I'm sorry, you don't understand.
- I'm awfully sorry.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.360
We haven't seen him for a long time,
so we didn't know.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.660
I always wanted him to find a nice girl.

13:18.020 --> 13:21.030
I'm so glad he found you.

13:24.860 --> 13:26.160
Peter.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.660
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.290
- I'm not his fiancée.
- Why did you tell me that you were?

13:38.390 --> 13:40.500
I'm not engaged.
I've never even spoken to the guy.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.170
What? But downstairs you said...
You said you were gonna marry him.

13:44.270 --> 13:46.920
I was talking to myself.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.090
Well, next time you talk to yourself,

13:49.190 --> 13:51.690
tell yourself you're single
and end the conversation.

13:52.180 --> 13:54.890
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

13:54.990 --> 13:58.560
She held me so tight.
You know, I couldn't tell her.

13:58.660 --> 14:01.200
- I know.
- Excuse me, nurse.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.190
- Is there a pharmacy in the hospital?
- What do you need?

14:04.290 --> 14:06.610
Elsie, she wants nitroglycerin.

14:06.710 --> 14:08.280
For her heart problem?

14:08.380 --> 14:09.670
Problem?

14:09.820 --> 14:11.210
Problems.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.260
You know something,
I think you saved her life.

14:14.990 --> 14:17.070
In fact, I think you saved
the whole family.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.100
Bless you.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.210
Why don't you come with me?
I'll take you down there.

14:47.820 --> 14:48.920
So,

14:49.450 --> 14:51.840
tell us how you met Peter.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.790
Ma, she doesn't wanna
talk about that now, okay?

14:54.890 --> 14:56.620
Why not?
Could use a nice story.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.170
- How do you know it was nice?
- Of course it was nice.

14:59.270 --> 15:00.630
Why shouldn't it be nice?

15:00.730 --> 15:03.210
What about that other girl?
The one he met in the bar.

15:03.310 --> 15:05.510
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

15:05.610 --> 15:08.440
- Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
- Ox.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.420
All I know is
she was pretty high and mighty

15:10.520 --> 15:12.790
for someone named after breakfast meat.

15:12.890 --> 15:15.120
Well, he has a nice girl now.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.330
So did you steal him from Ashley?

15:17.520 --> 15:21.090
I bet it was love at first sight. Right?

15:21.190 --> 15:23.320
I have a sense about these things.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.860
- Elsie, let her tell it.
- She is telling it.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.240
I bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his...

15:29.340 --> 15:32.220
What was it about him that,
you know, first struck you?

15:32.320 --> 15:35.810
- It was his, smile.
- They're caps.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.560
Six hundred bucks a tooth.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.610
Well, we saw each other

15:44.720 --> 15:48.570
and, he smiled.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.450
And...

15:51.350 --> 15:55.850
And I knew that my life
would never be the same.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.580
So...

16:03.240 --> 16:06.340
- Tomorrow night, 8:00.
- What?

16:08.290 --> 16:11.760
I got <i>Ice Capades</i>.
I know a guy.

17:25.290 --> 17:26.390
Hi.

17:38.180 --> 17:42.150
Bet you're wondering what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night?

17:43.180 --> 17:46.450
Well, I thought
I should introduce myself.

17:47.190 --> 17:48.990
My name's Lucy.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.210
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.840
Think you should know
your family thinks we're engaged.

17:57.650 --> 18:01.840
Never been engaged before.
This is all very sudden for me.

18:07.540 --> 18:11.980
What I really came here to tell you
was that

18:13.550 --> 18:16.020
I didn't mean for this to happen.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.490
I don't know what to do.

18:21.600 --> 18:26.030
I mean, if you were awake,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.910
Oh, God.
Not that I'm blaming you. Sorry.

18:29.570 --> 18:32.030
It's just that, you know,
when I was a kid,

18:32.130 --> 18:37.200
I always imagined what I would be like,

18:37.300 --> 18:41.720
or where I would be,
or what I would have when I got older.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.390
And, you know, it was the normal stuff.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.670
You know, I'd have a house and family
and things like that.

18:46.770 --> 18:49.500
You know, not that I'm complaining
or anything,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.940
because, you know, I have a cat.

18:52.220 --> 18:54.360
I have an apartment.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.990
Sole possession of the remote control.
That's very important.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.910
It's just...

19:02.140 --> 19:06.000
I never met anybody
that I could laugh with, you know?

19:12.320 --> 19:15.050
Do you believe in love at first sight?

19:15.820 --> 19:19.550
No, I bet you don't.
You're probably too sensible for that.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.210
Or have you ever, like, seen somebody,

19:24.310 --> 19:29.810
and you knew that if only that person
really knew you, they would...

19:29.920 --> 19:32.750
Well, they would of course dump
the perfect model that they were with

19:32.850 --> 19:37.820
and realize that you were the one
that they wanted to just grow old with.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.750
Have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven't even talked to?

19:55.830 --> 19:59.850
Have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma?

20:37.080 --> 20:42.560
<i>Brian Lynch. Mr. Brian Lynch,</i>
<i>please call Amber Lynch at 2617.</i>

20:46.840 --> 20:48.440
Oh, my God.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.200
Bye.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.730
- Lucy. We didn't know you were here.
- Hi.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.150
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.980
- Were you here all night?
- Yeah.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.590
You're like me.
I could always sleep anywhere.

21:08.450 --> 21:10.510
And believe me, she has.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.260
Way to go, Gram.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.000
So how's Peter?

21:15.100 --> 21:17.270
Well, he's got more color.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.200
He has some color.
Looks like he has some color.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.350
Yeah.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.510
Well, I have to go,
so it was great to see you guys again.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.940
- Why don't you tell her? Go on, tell her.
- Yeah.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.910
We didn't get to celebrate Christmas,

21:30.270 --> 21:32.660
so it would be nice if you could join us.

21:34.730 --> 21:37.570
I would love to, but I can't.

21:37.670 --> 21:41.490
- Jack's gonna be there.
- That's right. You haven't met Jack yet.

21:41.590 --> 21:45.910
- No, not yet.
- He'll be so happy to meet you.

21:46.010 --> 21:47.040
So you'll come tonight?

21:47.140 --> 21:49.580
I really shouldn't,
because I have to work. I can't.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.710
Look, here.
Put your phone number and address there.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.590
Midge'll call you and talk you into it.

21:54.690 --> 21:55.740
Okay.

21:56.130 --> 21:58.190
Here's another card
for when you change your mind.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.180
We're in the estate-furniture business.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.360
We buy furniture from dead people.

22:03.760 --> 22:08.440
Okay. All right, well, I have it, so bye.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.580
- Bye, dear. See you later.
- Bye.

22:11.810 --> 22:14.980
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
- What? What is this?

22:15.080 --> 22:17.440
I'm sorry, Mrs. Callaghan.
These are your husband's things.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.030
He's not my husband.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.590
I'm sorry. Your fiancé.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.680
You're Peter's fiancée?

22:30.330 --> 22:32.590
- Okay.
- Dalton Clarke.

22:32.690 --> 22:35.400
Colleague of Peter's
at Lubel, Parker, Jacobs and Fink.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.760
- I have to go now.
- He's a great guy.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.140
He's had a tough year.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.150
What with the accident
last month and all.

22:44.350 --> 22:46.980
- Accident?
- Well, of course it was an accident.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.290
I mean, it wasn't my...
Did he tell you it was my fault?

22:50.480 --> 22:54.880
We're playing basketball, all right?
I carry a pencil. I'm a lawyer, I do that.

22:54.980 --> 22:56.660
- Okay.
- Jesus, what's he...

22:56.760 --> 22:58.550
It's gonna be okay.

22:59.030 --> 23:00.780
So, what's the big deal?

23:00.880 --> 23:04.540
What's the big deal? Jerry, they
think I'm their future daughter-in-law.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.530
And the grandmother,
she's got this heart thing.

23:06.630 --> 23:09.090
If I tell the truth, she's gonna have
a heart attack and die,

23:09.190 --> 23:10.440
and it's gonna be on my head.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.550
Well, then, go along with it.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.720
And when Peter comes out of the coma,

23:14.820 --> 23:18.510
the family will be so happy,
they won't care that you lied to them.

23:18.610 --> 23:20.780
They'll probably even thank you for it.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.780
Just mustard.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.650
Okay, what if he doesn't
come out of his coma?

23:26.750 --> 23:28.440
Well, then who's to know?

23:28.540 --> 23:30.960
- I don't know.
- Now, look, look. Lucy.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.950
When my mother found out
I was getting married to my wife,

23:34.050 --> 23:35.740
her intestines exploded.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.620
- Oh, my God.
- Now, you tell them now,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.970
you might as well shoot Grandma.

23:43.160 --> 23:47.480
Come on, Mel. Mel...
Psst, psst, psst!

24:45.070 --> 24:47.000
What am I doing?

24:47.610 --> 24:48.710
Lucy.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.950
- Hi, Saul. Hi.
- You made it?

24:51.050 --> 24:53.720
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

24:54.120 --> 24:55.580
Okay. Okay.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.720
Come on, keep me company for a while.
I don't like to smoke in the house.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.890
- Listen, you want one?
- I'm trying to quit.

25:00.990 --> 25:02.930
That's good.

25:03.250 --> 25:04.890
Here, sit down.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.670
They don't bother you, do they?

25:07.770 --> 25:09.770
No, no, I'm fine.

25:10.220 --> 25:12.820
Did you know
that I was Peter's godfather?

25:12.970 --> 25:15.360
Really?
I thought you had to be Catholic for that.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.370
Ox fudged it over.

25:17.470 --> 25:20.500
He donated 50 folding chairs
to Father Shea's bingo night.

25:21.860 --> 25:24.880
You know, being a godfather
is very important to Catholics.

25:24.980 --> 25:27.950
It means you're practically
part of the family.

25:28.050 --> 25:29.920
Well, you're lucky.

25:30.410 --> 25:33.550
It's really important to have family
around this time of year.

25:34.790 --> 25:36.220
Are you...

25:36.540 --> 25:38.620
I mean, are your parents with you?

25:38.720 --> 25:41.250
No, no.
My mom died when I was really young.

25:41.350 --> 25:43.840
And a couple years ago, my dad got sick.

25:43.940 --> 25:47.800
And we moved from Indiana to Chicago
so he could go to a research hospital.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.240
Research.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.600
A medical term for "very expensive"?

25:52.700 --> 25:57.690
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I had to quit school
and then I started working for the CTA.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.810
And about a year ago,

25:59.910 --> 26:02.190
he decided he had had enough research,

26:02.290 --> 26:04.210
and he passed away.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.240
My wife of 51 years passed away
two years ago, February the 9th.

26:09.340 --> 26:10.660
I'm sorry.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.240
Yeah, it was a rough time for me.

26:12.340 --> 26:15.180
- Yeah.
- But Ox got me through.

26:15.330 --> 26:17.810
- You're good friends?
- The best.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.360
Lucy, the Callaghans...

26:23.670 --> 26:26.320
Well, they took me in
as part of their family.

26:27.340 --> 26:29.740
I'd never let anyone hurt them.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.410
Neither would I.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.950
I believe you wouldn't.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.960
Lucy?
You came?

26:40.360 --> 26:43.280
Hi, Saul. This is great.
Okay, come on in, you two.

26:43.380 --> 26:46.840
It's freezing out here.
Elsie made her eggnog.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.760
- Word to the wise, drink soda.
- Okay.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.850
Ox, Mom, look who's here.
Lucy came.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.040
What a surprise.

26:55.140 --> 26:58.790
- Hi, Mary.
- Come on in. It's cold out there.

26:58.890 --> 27:00.340
Oh, sweetheart.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.550
We've got the most wonderful dinner.

27:02.650 --> 27:03.760
It smells so good.

27:03.860 --> 27:04.910
Hi.

27:05.930 --> 27:07.860
This is so beautiful.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.020
- That's Peter on the right.
- He's so sweet.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.360
Yeah, the squirrels.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.130
Eggnog, everyone.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.410
Ma, where are you?
I'm serving your eggnog.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.420
I'm getting my camera.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.530
Come on, everybody.
Get close to the tree.

27:27.630 --> 27:29.390
Christmas pictures.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.000
- Lucy, come on.
- Come on, Lucy.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.020
- Let's go.
- I...

27:36.300 --> 27:38.020
Watch the birdie.

27:38.380 --> 27:40.020
Ma, take it again.
I blinked.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.730
You're lucky. I'm blind.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.680
Yeah, I love it.

27:44.780 --> 27:47.410
- Excuse me.
- I don't drink anymore.

27:48.770 --> 27:50.780
I don't drink any less either.

27:51.140 --> 27:53.660
- Perhaps I should.
- You got me on that one.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.230
Look at this.

27:55.330 --> 27:57.150
More presents.
I'll take these two.

27:57.250 --> 27:59.380
- What is this?
- Open it.

28:00.150 --> 28:02.280
- What is that?
- Turn them over.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.050
Pierced?
Really?

28:04.280 --> 28:05.660
Oh, my God, thank you.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.950
- We'll go to Wal-Mart on Monday.
- Thank you.

28:08.050 --> 28:10.780
Don't thank me. If it was up to me,
I would've gotten you a Barbie.

28:11.460 --> 28:13.280
- Did you like that?
- More presents.

28:13.790 --> 28:16.100
- We hit the jackpot.
- Mom, this is for you.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.090
"To Ox, from Uncle Al."

28:19.190 --> 28:20.510
Who the hell is Uncle Al?

28:20.610 --> 28:22.260
Uncle Al.
You know, Uncle Al from Buffalo.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.710
- You remember Al.
- Uncle Al?

28:23.810 --> 28:25.880
To Lucy, from Santa.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.600
- You remember Uncle Al.
- Remember Al? He was here.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.350
Yeah, that Uncle Al.

28:30.450 --> 28:32.960
That was
a real good Christmas.

28:33.690 --> 28:35.820
Seven bow ties, I bet.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.880
- You shouldn't have.
- That's right, she made these.

28:44.140 --> 28:48.120
The gold watch.
I love it.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.480
Sweetheart, it's so expensive.

28:51.710 --> 28:54.310
Gram, these are so great.
Thank you.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.440
They're so pretty.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.810
You remember Uncle Al,
don't you?

29:02.910 --> 29:06.060
No. Yeah, yeah.
Well, he wasn't really uncle.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.430
- I never got him anything.
- He had this moustache.

29:08.530 --> 29:10.310
He was Daddy's friend, right?

29:10.410 --> 29:12.540
- I know an Uncle Ed.
- No, Uncle Al.

29:17.030 --> 29:18.640
<i>This is Callaghan.</i>

29:18.740 --> 29:21.650
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you. Ciao.</i>

29:22.080 --> 29:23.580
<i>Hi, it's Ashley.</i>

29:23.680 --> 29:26.920
<i>Lisbon is absolutely gorgeous,</i>
<i>but I'm cutting my trip short,</i>

29:27.020 --> 29:29.690
<i>because I have been doing</i>
<i>a lot of thinking,</i>

29:29.840 --> 29:31.670
<i>and what the hey,</i>

29:31.770 --> 29:33.440
<i>I will marry you.</i>

30:04.120 --> 30:05.220
Jack.

30:05.340 --> 30:06.980
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

30:10.550 --> 30:12.230
Don't wake Lucy.

30:14.590 --> 30:16.320
Who's Lucy?

30:17.060 --> 30:18.950
Lucy's Peter fiancée.

30:19.430 --> 30:22.100
No, that's not Peter's fiancée.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.040
You haven't met her?

30:24.350 --> 30:25.450
No.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.120
Well, she's great.
You're gonna love her.

30:28.820 --> 30:31.710
You know what, kid?
Maybe I'll stay the night.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.780
Don't eat my cereal
in the morning.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.450
So it's Mary's special cereal.

30:35.550 --> 30:38.130
Last time you took
the toy surprise, remember?

31:07.530 --> 31:09.090
Good morning.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.630
Oh, God.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.050
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.140
Good morning, Jack.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.680
I guess I don't remember meeting you.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.020
Well, it's probably because
we've never met.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.020
That might have something to do with it.

31:32.510 --> 31:36.720
Cab. I have to go.
I'm really late, because I have to go.

31:36.820 --> 31:40.580
But it was nice to meet you, Jack.
So, bye.

31:42.570 --> 31:44.690
- Lucy.
- Okay, look.

31:44.790 --> 31:46.880
- I know that I...
- Hey.

31:49.110 --> 31:51.090
Welcome to the family.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.010
Thank you.

31:56.410 --> 31:57.510
Bye.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.760
We pray that the Lord's healing presence

32:05.860 --> 32:09.740
will be felt by those who are sick
and by their families.

32:10.010 --> 32:13.890
Especially Jo-Jo Goreki,
Peter Callaghan,

32:13.990 --> 32:16.580
Craig Little and Peggy Dunne.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.370
We pray to the Lord.

32:19.810 --> 32:21.940
- Lord, hear our prayer.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.700
O, God, you call us to live as one family.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.380
- Save us from...
- So who's this Lucy?

32:28.780 --> 32:31.050
She's your brother's fiancée.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.000
You'd think
if Peter were getting married,

32:35.100 --> 32:37.180
he would have announced it
in the <i>Tribune</i>.

32:37.290 --> 32:40.190
- We read the <i>Sun Times</i>. Amen.
- Amen.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.050
So why did she sneak out this morning?

32:43.150 --> 32:44.420
She has a job.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.800
I like Mass better in Latin.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.700
It's nicer when you don't know
what they're saying.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.080
- Did you get the Bourbeau estate?
- Got it.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.270
- What about Downey's?
- Got it.

32:55.370 --> 32:57.170
- Himmelstein's?
- Yeah.

32:57.270 --> 33:00.250
- Did you get Van Allan?
- Himmelstein's took too long.

33:00.650 --> 33:03.610
- For Chrissake, Jack.
- Stop swearing.

33:03.710 --> 33:05.820
Look, you're running the business now.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.570
There's something I'd like to talk about.

33:07.670 --> 33:10.040
- Talk about that later, okay?
- Talk about it now.

33:10.140 --> 33:13.210
- He can't kill you in church.
- Will you please pipe down?

33:13.310 --> 33:15.250
Hey, be nice, pally. We're in church.

33:15.350 --> 33:17.880
- You're disrupting the Mass.
- Who made you the pope?

33:17.980 --> 33:19.030
Ox.

33:19.260 --> 33:21.940
How did Joe Kelly get to be a lector?

33:22.170 --> 33:23.720
He takes marijuana.

33:23.820 --> 33:24.870
Amen.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.340
- Hi, Luce.
- Hi, Lucy.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.740
Hi, Lucy.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.650
Come on, you stupid wing nut.
Your mother's...

34:40.690 --> 34:42.920
Excuse me, do you live here?

34:44.070 --> 34:47.420
Live here?
I own this place.

34:49.239 --> 34:53.929
Great. Well, then you would know
the woman that lives in 201.

34:54.250 --> 34:57.100
Know her?
I'm dating her.

35:36.420 --> 35:37.900
Very clean.

35:40.510 --> 35:41.780
Kitty?

35:45.350 --> 35:47.950
Kitty?
Rich kitty?

35:49.440 --> 35:51.450
Come here. Mealtime.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.370
Kitty, kitty, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.

35:58.570 --> 35:59.840
Kitty.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.380
Kitty?

36:05.700 --> 36:10.720
Food. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.770
Come here. Come on, honey.
Where are you?

36:20.430 --> 36:23.070
I'm so sorry.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.570
Nice shot.

36:27.690 --> 36:31.690
I'll get you some ice. I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anybody.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.660
Hey, how'd you get in here?

36:36.280 --> 36:37.370
Key?

36:37.470 --> 36:39.110
Key.
You stay here a lot?

36:39.210 --> 36:41.470
You know, feed the cat.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.760
Peter doesn't have a cat.

36:53.210 --> 36:57.220
Hello.
Hello, honey.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.780
Fluffy.
Hello, Fluffy.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.070
You must be so hungry.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.790
Are you gonna get that?

37:09.820 --> 37:12.670
No, I'm gonna let the machine get it.

37:17.660 --> 37:18.960
Hello?

37:23.410 --> 37:24.970
It's for you.

37:33.510 --> 37:34.810
Hello.

37:37.890 --> 37:40.320
Okay. Bye-bye.

37:41.730 --> 37:43.480
That was the hospital.

37:43.580 --> 37:47.620
They say it's customary for friends and
family to come down and give blood.

37:48.610 --> 37:50.370
Let's go together.

37:55.660 --> 37:58.120
You know what?
I think maybe we should take your truck.

37:58.220 --> 38:01.160
No, we ought to take Peter's car.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.310
Okay.

38:02.710 --> 38:04.260
You know where it's parked, don't you?

38:04.360 --> 38:06.980
Yeah, I... Yeah.

38:14.510 --> 38:17.320
Hey, we'll have to get
your picture for the mantel.

38:18.010 --> 38:20.280
- Of me?
- No, of you and Peter.

38:20.390 --> 38:22.780
I'm not that photogenic.

38:22.940 --> 38:24.480
I doubt that.

38:24.580 --> 38:28.070
All right, now, I want you to sit here
and sip this or you'll get woozy.

38:28.170 --> 38:29.780
When did you start seeing Peter?

38:29.880 --> 38:31.750
September 17th.

38:32.780 --> 38:36.050
- Three months. That's quick.
- You have no idea.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.660
- That's fast. That's...
- Miss.

38:38.760 --> 38:39.790
I'm fine.

38:39.890 --> 38:42.330
- That's a fast engagement.
- Wait, I'm not finished.

38:42.430 --> 38:44.480
I got it. I got it. I got it.

38:49.090 --> 38:52.300
What the hell's he got a TV for?
He's in a coma for Chrissakes.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.780
Ox. You know, he might hear you.

38:55.140 --> 38:56.970
Then get him a radio.

38:57.070 --> 38:58.640
Maybe he'd like us to sing to him.

38:58.740 --> 39:01.330
Maybe Lucy knows his favorite song.

39:01.770 --> 39:03.870
- Puff the Magic Dragon.
- Dragon.

39:04.150 --> 39:05.460
Dragon.

39:06.230 --> 39:09.000
Which one of the Three Stooges
was Peter's favorite?

39:10.320 --> 39:12.630
- Curly.
- Curly.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.250
- He's everybody's favorite.
- Well, I like Shemp.

39:18.350 --> 39:21.000
- Favorite ice cream?
- Baskin-Robbins.

39:21.100 --> 39:24.090
- Favorite baseball team?
- Chicago.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.750
Cubs or White Sox?

39:25.850 --> 39:27.730
What the heck is going on?

39:28.170 --> 39:30.530
Why are you asking her
all these questions?

39:31.180 --> 39:33.610
Don't ask me. Ask her boyfriend.

39:35.310 --> 39:36.770
That isn't very funny, you know.

39:36.870 --> 39:40.580
No, no. Not this boyfriend. Joe Fusco.

39:42.650 --> 39:43.860
Joe Jr?

39:43.960 --> 39:47.040
That's right.
Mr. Joe Fusco, Jr.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.280
He said that you were intimate.

39:49.380 --> 39:51.430
Yeah, well, he also said
he invented aluminum foil.

39:51.530 --> 39:52.780
He's delusional.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.620
He was very lucid when I talked to him.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.700
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.440
- Ma, are you okay?
- You see what you did?

39:59.540 --> 40:00.630
What did I do?

40:00.730 --> 40:05.110
You know, if she wanted to prove it,
she'd prove it.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.790
Peter has one testicle.

40:24.190 --> 40:25.820
- No way.
- Way.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.320
About a month ago,

40:27.420 --> 40:29.910
there was an accident,
and he was playing basketball,

40:30.010 --> 40:34.100
and his friend had a pencil
in his back pocket.

40:39.460 --> 40:40.810
Maybe...

40:41.550 --> 40:42.650
No.

40:43.590 --> 40:44.780
Oh, no.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.940
- Well, somebody's gotta look.
- Don't look at me.

40:48.220 --> 40:50.640
- No.
- Yeah, maybe...

40:50.740 --> 40:54.660
- Listen, it's not my...
- Okay, I'm his mother.

40:56.190 --> 40:57.690
Oh, Ma.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.960
Well, look at the bright side.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.520
He's got more room in his Jockey shorts.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.020
Ma.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.500
- Who is it?
- What gives?

41:38.400 --> 41:40.940
- You stood me up.
- For what?

41:41.040 --> 41:42.990
- Our date.
- What date?

41:43.090 --> 41:45.410
To the <i>Ice Capades</i>.
I had to eat your ticket.

41:45.510 --> 41:47.280
I never said
I would go on a date with you.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.620
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

41:49.720 --> 41:50.970
- Did.
- Didn't.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.350
- Who is it?
- Lucy, it's Saul.

41:54.460 --> 41:57.050
- Oh, my God.
- What, are you two-timing Joe Jr?

41:57.150 --> 41:58.920
I'm not two-timing.
I never one-timed.

41:59.020 --> 42:01.220
- Hey, I'll fight the guy.
- Hey. Get in the closet.

42:02.300 --> 42:05.240
- Not a word.
- Nice panties.

42:10.270 --> 42:11.370
Hey.

42:11.980 --> 42:15.080
I like boxer shorts, but I'll try these if...

42:15.610 --> 42:18.150
- Sorry.
- Have you got company?

42:18.250 --> 42:21.160
No, TV. It's on. Next door.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.870
Do you want some coffee
or tea, or something?

42:25.970 --> 42:28.180
No, no. Not a thing.

42:28.540 --> 42:30.430
Lucy, there's something you should know.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.180
What?

42:32.590 --> 42:35.630
Well, the night you visited Peter,
I was outside the door.

42:35.730 --> 42:37.440
I know the truth.

42:42.140 --> 42:44.440
Sorry. You know,
you don't have to worry,

42:44.540 --> 42:46.120
because I'm gonna tell them everything.

42:46.220 --> 42:47.950
Don't tell them a thing.

42:50.770 --> 42:52.440
You remember the day you said

42:52.540 --> 42:54.220
you'd never do anything
to hurt the family?

42:54.320 --> 42:55.660
- Yeah.
- Well, since they met you,

42:55.760 --> 42:57.920
they figure they have Peter back.

42:58.530 --> 43:01.670
Now, if you tell them the truth,
you'll take him away again.

43:02.740 --> 43:06.720
They need you, Lucy.
Just like you need them.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.270
Now, look, I know you're a good girl.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.840
And I know you'll do the right thing.

43:13.940 --> 43:15.980
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Yes, you will.

43:19.890 --> 43:23.100
By the way, how did you know about the...

43:23.200 --> 43:25.120
Peter, with the one...

43:26.890 --> 43:29.620
You know something?
I don't wanna know.

43:32.570 --> 43:33.670
Bye.

43:35.650 --> 43:38.260
Oh, my God.
What are you... What?

43:38.490 --> 43:41.090
- What are you doing?
- I slipped.

43:41.910 --> 43:44.970
- You're trying on my shoes?
- No.

43:45.250 --> 43:46.370
When I fell, my foot went

43:46.470 --> 43:48.110
right into the shoe.

43:48.210 --> 43:50.960
- Who is it?
- It's me, Jack Callaghan.

43:51.060 --> 43:53.630
Oh, my God, doesn't anybody
use a phone anymore?

43:53.730 --> 43:56.530
- I do.
- I'm not talking about 900 numbers.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.070
Who told?

44:04.140 --> 44:07.330
Hi. So, more questions?

44:07.430 --> 44:09.750
No. I have an engagement present
for you.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.320
You really shouldn't have.

44:13.420 --> 44:16.050
I didn't.
It's from my parents.

44:16.740 --> 44:19.010
It's furniture.
You want me to bring it up?

44:19.410 --> 44:21.510
Hey, was that Saul I saw leaving?

44:23.080 --> 44:24.560
What's that?

44:25.080 --> 44:26.180
Cat.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.140
Big cat?

44:28.300 --> 44:34.110
I think you should bring it to...
Bring it to Peter's apartment.

44:34.220 --> 44:36.260
- You don't know what it is.
- Well, you know,

44:36.360 --> 44:38.910
anything would look nicer
in Peter's apartment.

44:39.470 --> 44:40.990
You know what?
I'll come with you.

45:07.380 --> 45:09.810
You know what?
I think you parked too...

45:13.050 --> 45:15.340
You know, I think you parked
too close to the other car.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.700
I had to. We gotta unload the furniture.

45:17.810 --> 45:19.410
Ready for your surprise?

45:22.020 --> 45:23.320
Ta-da!

45:23.860 --> 45:27.710
That is great.
That is so great.

45:29.070 --> 45:31.460
- You like that?
- Yeah.

45:31.740 --> 45:34.470
Too bad. Ox bought you the love seat.

45:35.120 --> 45:38.140
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I made this.

45:39.370 --> 45:42.270
- This? No, you didn't.
- Shocking, isn't it?

45:43.170 --> 45:45.520
- Can I sit in it?
- Rock out.

45:50.930 --> 45:52.990
My God, this is perfect.

45:53.260 --> 45:55.320
You should go into business
or something.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.120
Well, that gets tricky.

45:58.640 --> 46:02.040
Yeah, working with your
dad and everything, right?

46:02.400 --> 46:04.520
The business used to be called
Callaghan and Sons,

46:04.620 --> 46:08.450
and when Peter went off to law school,
it became Callaghan and Son.

46:08.550 --> 46:11.970
If I were to leave, it'll just be Callaghan.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.100
Let's take a second here
and unlock the doors...

46:20.200 --> 46:23.560
No, I got it, I got it. See?
Here we go.

46:23.670 --> 46:29.240
This technique. It's always very...
A very modern technique.

46:29.970 --> 46:32.220
Excuse me, sir.
What apartment?

46:32.320 --> 46:33.370
57G.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.330
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but guests
have to be announced, you know?

46:38.430 --> 46:40.500
Well, I'm with her. I'm helping her.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.500
- So?
- You don't know her?

46:46.110 --> 46:47.210
No.

46:49.990 --> 46:51.720
But I'm new here.

46:51.820 --> 46:55.560
Well, she's Peter Callaghan's
fiancée in 57G.

46:55.750 --> 46:56.850
Yeah.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.480
They told me about her, sir.

47:03.260 --> 47:04.760
She's scary.

47:04.860 --> 47:06.190
Tell me about it.

47:11.140 --> 47:12.270
Be careful.

47:12.370 --> 47:15.660
Maybe we should angle it a little bit.

47:17.110 --> 47:18.480
I think it's wedged.

47:18.580 --> 47:21.790
Why don't you step back for a little bit?
I'm gonna try an old trick.

47:22.570 --> 47:24.110
What's the trick?

47:24.210 --> 47:25.420
Push it really hard.

47:27.070 --> 47:28.170
Okay.

47:29.330 --> 47:30.890
Okay, okay, push.

47:31.540 --> 47:32.640
I did.

47:35.540 --> 47:37.430
Do you want me to help you now?

47:37.590 --> 47:40.150
- All right, a little help would be good.
- Okay.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.650
Ready?
One, two, three.

47:55.190 --> 47:57.870
I think the sofa should go right there.

48:02.530 --> 48:07.720
Oh, no. No, no, no. Look at this.
Idiot has blocked me in.

48:07.870 --> 48:12.100
- But I told you not to park that close.
- Aargh.

48:12.750 --> 48:14.720
Hey, check the meter, see what time.

48:15.040 --> 48:19.110
It's 6:00. They can pretty much stay
here all night if they wanted to.

48:19.380 --> 48:21.360
All night?

48:22.640 --> 48:23.890
Good night.

48:23.990 --> 48:25.920
You're just gonna leave me here
with the truck?

48:26.380 --> 48:27.770
Basically, yeah.

48:27.870 --> 48:29.980
Well, maybe I ought to walk you back.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.500
Well, what for?

48:31.600 --> 48:34.710
- For protection.
- No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

48:35.190 --> 48:39.090
For me. I don't wanna be here
by myself. This is Chicago.

48:48.410 --> 48:50.050
You look cold.

48:50.210 --> 48:54.250
- You look cold.
- Probably because I am cold.

48:54.420 --> 48:55.500
How about you?

48:55.600 --> 48:58.260
This jacket's reversible.
I'm wearing the warm side now.

48:58.360 --> 48:59.610
I see.

49:00.930 --> 49:02.360
You need a better coat.

49:03.600 --> 49:07.160
- This is my dad's.
- Then he's probably freezing.

49:07.270 --> 49:08.910
He passed away.

49:09.600 --> 49:12.000
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

49:12.770 --> 49:17.040
He passed away last year.
I don't even remember my mom, so...

49:17.650 --> 49:19.410
Well, what was he like?

49:19.510 --> 49:22.880
He was a lot like me.
Dark hair, flat chest.

49:24.450 --> 49:26.040
What do you remember most about him?

49:26.140 --> 49:30.020
That. Okay.
Well...

49:31.790 --> 49:33.090
He liked maps.

49:33.190 --> 49:36.190
Yeah, I live by maps.
My truck's filled with them.

49:37.090 --> 49:40.090
He used to hear of a place on the TV,
we would pull out the atlas,

49:40.190 --> 49:44.270
we'd find where it was and we'd route
out this, like, little way to get there.

49:44.550 --> 49:46.700
If there was one place
in the world where you'd go...

49:46.800 --> 49:48.240
Florence.

49:48.810 --> 49:51.520
Italy? I haven't delivered
any furniture to Florence yet,

49:51.620 --> 49:53.650
- but I'm told it's nice.
- Yeah.

49:53.750 --> 49:55.490
I take it you've never been there.

49:55.590 --> 49:59.550
Well, you know, the L doesn't exactly
make it all the way to Florence, so...

50:01.080 --> 50:02.930
But I do have...

50:05.650 --> 50:06.830
My passport.

50:06.930 --> 50:09.670
- You have your passport? With you?
- Yes, I do.

50:09.770 --> 50:12.130
Yes, well, just in case I need to
quickly leave the country.

50:12.230 --> 50:14.520
- You need to...
- Yeah, it's perfect. It's great.

50:14.840 --> 50:18.990
You're right.
You're not very photogenic at all.

50:20.430 --> 50:21.950
Just joking.

50:22.180 --> 50:23.780
There aren't any stamps in that.

50:24.140 --> 50:26.150
Yeah, well, I haven't gone anywhere yet.

50:26.250 --> 50:28.710
But, you know, I'm planning
the trip to Florence really soon,

50:28.810 --> 50:30.750
so, you know, I'll go.

50:32.740 --> 50:34.950
That'll make your dad very proud.

50:35.050 --> 50:36.100
Yeah.

50:38.490 --> 50:43.050
You know, in a very small way,
you kind of remind me of him a little bit.

50:44.630 --> 50:45.730
I see.

50:46.080 --> 50:48.870
So he was a classy guy,
always a gentleman.

50:48.970 --> 50:49.970
A working man, who...

50:50.070 --> 50:52.250
Who just stepped in doggy poopy.

50:54.550 --> 50:57.740
Now, that's classy.
That's classy.

50:59.720 --> 51:02.370
All right, tell me more.
Where did you grow up?

51:02.850 --> 51:04.980
God, you've just become
Mr. Chatty this evening.

51:05.080 --> 51:07.270
The fact is,
I'm about to start shivering,

51:07.370 --> 51:10.000
and making conversation
keeps my face from freezing.

51:13.910 --> 51:16.180
Thank you. I had a good time.

51:17.990 --> 51:21.080
- It's slippery here. Come on.
- I'm fine.

51:21.180 --> 51:23.180
We got this far,
I'll take you the rest of the way.

51:23.280 --> 51:25.420
You gotta watch out. A little icy.

51:25.520 --> 51:28.310
So you gonna go see Peter tomorrow?

51:34.010 --> 51:35.680
- All right.
- Do not take me with you.

51:35.780 --> 51:38.450
- No, it's all right. Not too bad.
- You got it? Good? Okay.

51:44.820 --> 51:47.320
This is big.

51:48.030 --> 51:50.090
- There we go. All right.
- Okay.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.760
- All right?
- Yeah.

52:07.860 --> 52:12.050
I think we're all right now.
Yeah. Let's just move this way.

52:12.150 --> 52:13.450
This way.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.220
- Whoa. Ow.
- Ow.

52:15.320 --> 52:16.950
What was that?

52:17.180 --> 52:19.100
Was that my pants or my muscles?

52:19.200 --> 52:21.770
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

52:21.870 --> 52:23.580
- Whoa.
- Okay.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.710
Oh, man.

52:32.160 --> 52:34.380
Do you have an extra pair of pants
in your apartment?

52:34.480 --> 52:36.420
If you fit into my pants, I will kill myself.

52:37.660 --> 52:40.240
- You don't have to follow me.
- No, you're blocking the wind.

52:48.800 --> 52:51.100
I'll wait till you get inside.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.860
Well, good night.

52:54.680 --> 52:55.980
Night.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.210
- I'll see you when I see you?
- Yeah.

53:20.170 --> 53:22.960
All right, Lucy, it's either me or him.

53:23.060 --> 53:24.110
Him.

53:27.800 --> 53:30.490
You don't have to answer right away.

53:54.330 --> 53:56.980
I'm having an affair.
I like Jack.

53:57.290 --> 53:58.390
Who's Jack?

53:58.590 --> 54:00.210
- Peter's brother.
- So?

54:00.310 --> 54:02.550
- So he thinks I'm engaged.
- To who?

54:02.650 --> 54:04.020
To Peter.

54:05.390 --> 54:08.010
Lucy, I really don't have time for this.

54:08.110 --> 54:11.400
Oh, no, no, no.
You have to tell me what to do.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.700
Tell the truth.

54:12.850 --> 54:16.290
If I tell Jack that I lied to his family,
he will never speak to me again.

54:16.480 --> 54:20.770
And Ox and Midge and Mary and Saul.

54:20.870 --> 54:23.290
Saul?
Who's Saul?

54:23.530 --> 54:27.630
He's the next-door neighbor.
But you know what? Actually, he knows.

54:27.910 --> 54:30.200
Lucy, you're born into a family.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.800
You do not join them
like you do the Marines.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.310
You have to tell me what to do.

54:37.210 --> 54:38.730
Pull the plug.

54:39.210 --> 54:41.310
- You are sick.
- I'm sick?

54:41.550 --> 54:43.940
You're cheating on a vegetable.

54:45.930 --> 54:47.900
Down and dirty.

54:50.430 --> 54:52.280
Are you gonna fold?

54:53.060 --> 54:54.910
You're not gonna fold?

54:55.810 --> 54:58.500
He is staying in with a pair.

54:58.900 --> 55:01.790
Very impressive. Very bold, confident.

55:02.860 --> 55:04.420
Full house.

55:04.820 --> 55:08.290
You are unlucky at cards.

55:09.620 --> 55:11.550
But lucky in love.

55:15.090 --> 55:19.100
Remember in, like, fifth or sixth grade,

55:19.420 --> 55:21.900
I was starting to get
really good at poker,

55:22.090 --> 55:24.740
and going home with lots of lunch money?

55:25.600 --> 55:28.450
I got to know the principal's
office really well.

55:29.140 --> 55:31.370
He always used to say to me,

55:31.600 --> 55:35.000
"How come you can't be more
like your brother Peter?"

55:38.110 --> 55:40.710
Well, you know what?
I was all right with that.

55:41.110 --> 55:44.010
I had no problems with that,
because I was proud of you.

55:44.530 --> 55:48.050
And I was never envious
of anything that you had.

55:53.630 --> 55:55.060
Until now.

56:00.550 --> 56:02.320
I'll cut the deck.

56:02.930 --> 56:05.490
High card gets Lucy.

56:12.650 --> 56:16.000
All right, we'll go best out of three.

56:16.490 --> 56:19.150
So, Lucy, have you and Peter decided

56:19.250 --> 56:21.200
where you're gonna go on your honeymoon?

56:21.300 --> 56:22.880
I went to Cuba.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.430
Ricky Ricardo was Cuban.

56:25.580 --> 56:27.620
Didn't Peter look great today?

56:27.720 --> 56:28.720
That kid.

56:28.820 --> 56:30.300
You know, he should've been an actor.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.420
He's tall.

56:31.520 --> 56:33.270
All the great ones were tall.

56:33.420 --> 56:36.770
Lucy, you think you can find me
a nice girl for Jack?

56:37.010 --> 56:38.180
Mom, come on.

56:38.280 --> 56:41.950
Well, I really don't know Jack's type,
so I'm not one to...

56:42.180 --> 56:44.530
I like blonds. Chubby ones.

56:47.730 --> 56:49.190
Alan Ladd wasn't tall.

56:49.290 --> 56:51.540
Marshal Dillon was 6'5".

56:52.020 --> 56:54.790
Well, we all know
who Lucy's type is.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.960
These mashed potatoes are so creamy.

56:58.860 --> 57:00.470
You like brunettes.

57:01.740 --> 57:03.810
I could never make a good pot roast.

57:03.910 --> 57:05.140
You need good beef.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.390
Argentina has great beef.
Beef and Nazis.

57:09.750 --> 57:11.640
John Wayne was tall.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.770
Dustin Hoffman was 5'6".

57:14.050 --> 57:16.780
Would you wanna see Dustin
Hoffman save the Alamo?

57:16.880 --> 57:18.560
These mashed potatoes
are so creamy.

57:18.660 --> 57:20.810
- Spain has good beef.
- Mary mashed them.

57:20.910 --> 57:24.160
- Cesar Romero was tall.
- Cesar Romero was not Spanish.

57:24.390 --> 57:26.330
I didn't say Cesar Romero was Spanish.

57:26.430 --> 57:27.790
Well, what did you say?

57:27.900 --> 57:29.480
I said Cesar Romero was tall.

57:29.580 --> 57:31.970
- We all know he's tall.
- Well, that's what I said.

57:32.070 --> 57:34.340
Cesar Romero was tall. That's all I said.

57:35.070 --> 57:37.650
So if you need any help
with history, don't call me.

57:37.750 --> 57:41.370
Now, remember, honey, if you're free
for New Year's, we wanna see you.

57:41.470 --> 57:42.750
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

57:42.850 --> 57:44.550
- I had a great time. Thank you.
- Us, too.

57:44.650 --> 57:46.580
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lucy.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.210
Hey, look, you guys.
You're under the mistletoe.

57:51.170 --> 57:53.550
- Kiss her then. It's mistletoe.
- Yeah.

57:53.650 --> 57:55.370
- It's tradition.
- It's Christmas.

57:55.470 --> 57:57.860
Come on, idiot, kiss her.

58:00.430 --> 58:02.970
- There you go.
- Yeah.

58:03.310 --> 58:04.690
- Good night.
- Bye.

58:04.790 --> 58:05.900
Good night.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.650
Mary,
we're on dish detail tonight.

58:07.750 --> 58:08.870
- Let's go.
- Ma.

58:09.690 --> 58:12.030
I don't wanna hear
any excuses.

58:12.130 --> 58:14.550
Since the first year, I remember.

58:22.160 --> 58:23.720
Regular fare.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.690
One token, please.

58:29.300 --> 58:31.840
My God, Mary, what are you doing here?

58:31.940 --> 58:34.470
Hi. You wanna come through?

58:34.570 --> 58:36.450
- We can?
- Yeah, absolutely.

58:37.430 --> 58:38.560
Come on in.

58:38.660 --> 58:40.330
Transfer, please.

58:40.440 --> 58:41.640
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:41.740 --> 58:42.940
Hey, who's this?

58:43.040 --> 58:44.860
- I'm Mary. This is Beth.
- Hi.

58:44.960 --> 58:46.440
Mary's my...

58:46.540 --> 58:48.860
Lucy's going to marry my brother Peter.

58:48.960 --> 58:51.500
What?
Lucy, you're getting married?

58:51.990 --> 58:53.780
Well, it hasn't
really been announced.

58:53.880 --> 58:58.740
So it's a little awkward for
me to say anything, and...

58:58.870 --> 59:01.580
- The train is here.
- Train. Okay, I'll see you later.

59:01.680 --> 59:04.590
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.300
Girl, are you pregnant?

59:06.400 --> 59:08.050
Yes, I'm pregnant, Celeste.

59:08.150 --> 59:09.880
Lucy, you're not telling me
what's going on.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.050
You're not giving me details.
What's going on?

59:12.150 --> 59:14.560
Celeste, you have to have sex
in order to be pregnant.

59:14.660 --> 59:16.240
But I thought you were engaged.

59:17.390 --> 59:19.950
Well, we're waiting.

59:21.770 --> 59:23.080
Waiting?

59:24.270 --> 59:26.610
<i>Peter?</i>
<i>Hi, it's Ashley.</i>

59:26.710 --> 59:28.170
<i>Is this machine working?</i>

59:28.360 --> 59:29.780
<i>Look, I'm back in Chicago</i>

59:29.880 --> 59:32.660
<i>and I'm kind of shocked</i>
<i>that you haven't called me back.</i>

59:32.760 --> 59:34.580
<i>Look, I really would like to</i>
<i>hear from you,</i>

59:34.680 --> 59:38.310
<i>and I'd like to see my cat. Call me.</i>

59:38.960 --> 59:43.000
New Year's Eve hasn't been the same
since Guy Lombardo died.

59:43.100 --> 59:44.880
I love a clarinet.

59:44.980 --> 59:47.010
You know, nobody plays the clarinet
anymore.

59:47.110 --> 59:50.030
Guy Lombardo didn't play the clarinet.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.490
I didn't say Guy Lombardo
played the clarinet.

59:52.690 --> 59:54.260
- Hey, Pop.
- Your Benny Goodman,

59:54.360 --> 59:55.890
he could play the licorice stick.

59:55.990 --> 59:58.100
- We got the Van Allan estate.
- Hey, way to go.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.390
- Attaboy.
- That's great.

59:59.490 --> 01:00:01.360
- That's great. Attaboy.
- Way to go.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.040
Hey, everybody.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:04.920
Lucy's pregnant.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.160
How did you find out?
What do you mean she's pregnant?

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.200
- How do you know?
- That's what Beth said.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.370
Jack, do you know anything about this?

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.520
Go up to your room.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.680
- Who is it?
- Joe Jr.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.350
I'm not here.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.310
I know that trick.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.010
Hey, my old man's got a set of keys.

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.780
That is illegal and you know it, Joey.

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.270
Ta-da!

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.910
I told them to give me the same ones

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:35.540
they use in the winner's circle
at Arlington.

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:37.540
They're beautiful.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.910
I can't accept them.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.710
I could move in here.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.530
I bet you Pop would knock
50 bucks off the rent.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.900
I have six months left to live.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.710
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.210
It's that other guy, isn't it?

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:55.580
What do you mean?

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.790
I've seen the way you look at him.

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.550
What?
How do I look at him?

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.870
Like you just seen your first Trans Am.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.400
Here, take them.

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.740
You can lay them on my coffin.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.080
Thank you.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.210
Are you wearing the black bra?

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:27.550
I love black underwears.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.190
Jack.

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:38.060
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:43.180
You're going to a party.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.260
Yeah, my friend Celeste
is having a party tonight.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.480
Great. Hey, I'll drive you.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:50.010
You know what?
It's really not that far. It's fine.

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.910
No, come on, come on.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.000
Okay, but it's really not that far.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:57.460
I move a lot of things with this truck.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.990
So is everything okay?

01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:01.780
Why?
Why wouldn't it be okay?

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.530
You're just acting really weird.

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:05.650
- No, I'm not being weird.
- Yes, you are.

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:07.690
No, I'm not being weird.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:11.310
- So, what about Peter?
- What about Peter?

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.340
Peter is going to have a lot
to deal with when he wakes up.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.350
- Lucy, hi. How are you?
- Hi.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.090
Come in, come in. Hey, everybody.

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.150
Lucy and her fiancé are here.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.110
- Lucy. How's it going?
- Jerry, you know Peter, right?

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.530
Thank you. Hi. Take his coat, Cindy.

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:30.480
- Is this Peter?
- I gotta talk to you.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.850
Well, jeez, he looks good.

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.340
That's not Peter, that's Jack.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.900
- Who's Jack again?
- Peter's brother.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.030
- Peter's the guy who's in the coma?
- Yeah.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.490
So then why did you bring Jack?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.530
I didn't bring Jack. He followed me here.

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.450
- So Jack's the fiancé?
- No, Peter.

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.040
Peter doesn't even know you exist.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.540
- I know.
- So Jack is Peter?

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640
Yeah.

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.040
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.900
They have doctors for this kind of thing.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.070
Hey.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:00.760
- That's spiked.
- Thank God.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.930
- You shouldn't have any.
- Why not?

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.530
Because it's not good for the baby.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.740
Wait a minute, will you?

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.860
- It's freezing.
- Watch out, watch out.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.980
This whole evening did not work out
well at all, and...

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.040
And I'm supposed to share
some responsibility in that?

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:21.520
No. Would you slow down a little bit?

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.800
Look, it was just a misunderstanding,

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.600
and on top of the Joe Jr. Thing...

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.780
Excuse me?

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.060
It's nothing.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.160
No, no, no, there's no nothing now.
What Joe Jr. Thing?

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.020
The leaning thing.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.400
The leaning thing?

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.830
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:45.450
What do you mean by the leaning...
Because he gave me flowers?

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:47.660
And then you leaned.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.950
- And then I leaned.
- Yeah.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:52.240
Okay. How did I lean when I leaned?

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.580
- How were you leaning?
- Yeah.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.210
It was a lot different than hugging.
Hugging's very different.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.230
Hugging, that involves arms and hands,

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.780
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in like this.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.400
Leaning involves wanting

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:12.490
and accepting, leaning.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.960
Hey, Luce.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:19.670
Is this guy bothering you?

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.900
No, no.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.550
Are you sure?
Because it looks like he's leaning.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.310
Thank you. See?

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.960
I'll be right over here
if you need me.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.110
Okay, thank you very much.

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.000
I know karate.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.710
Okay, is...

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.270
Now, all right,
what about the other thing?

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:52.880
The other thing?
The other misunderstanding?

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.420
Why did you think I was pregnant?

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.050
Well, Mary said that she had heard
something like that.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.970
And you believed her?

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:04.090
I didn't have any reason
not to believe her.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.610
So the only reason your brother
would wanna marry someone like me

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.000
is if I was pregnant, right?

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.550
No, no.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.850
Good night.

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.150
The fact is,
you're not really Peter's type.

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:22.900
Yeah, Jack? All right.
Whose type am I?

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.790
- Thank you.
- Look, it's a great idea, you and Peter.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.990
It's just not obvious
to the whole world, that's all.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:33.830
You know what, Jack?
I've had a really lousy Christmas.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.590
You've just managed
to kill my New Year's.

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:38.410
If you come back on Easter,
you can burn down my apartment.

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:41.840
- Hey, come on, Lucy.
- What do you want from me, Jack?

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.200
I want you not to be unhappy.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.370
And what are you,
the happiness guru, Jack?

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:47.470
Are you happy?

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.380
I don't remember you having
had a conversation with your father.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.120
You wanna leave the business, don't you?

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.220
Is this just another miscommunication
that we are having here?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.050
What do you know about my family?

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:59.330
Spending a week with them
does not make you an expert.

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:02.200
Spending a lifetime with them
hasn't made you one either.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.730
Yeah, well, I know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated.

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.860
Would your father be happy knowing
you're sitting in a token booth

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.130
planning vacations
that you aren't taking?

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.220
No, he wouldn't. You're right.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.720
But you have no idea
what it's like to be alone.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.230
Hey, you have Peter.

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:29.520
I don't have anybody.

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.180
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:35.780
Good night.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.990
Happy New Year!

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.940
Happy New Year!

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.680
<i>~ For auld lang syne, my dear ~</i>

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.140
<i>~ For auld lang syne ~</i>

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:01.540
<i>~ We'll take a cup</i>
<i>of kindness yet ~</i>

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:06.020

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:10.730
<i>~ For auld lang syne, my dear ~</i>

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:13.970
Ox, they called me
and told me to get down here.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.070
- What happened?
- He's awake.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.900
<i>Will the Meyers family</i>
<i>please meet in the solarium?</i>

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.700
- Boy, will he be glad to see you.
- Yeah.

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:27.500
Peter.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.700
Peter.

01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:32.420
Your family's here, Peter.

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:11.840
Who are you?

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.580
My God.

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:23.350
He's got amnesia.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.140
Lacunar amnesia is a condition

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.130
in which memory loss
is localized and patchy.

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:36.620
Limited to isolated events.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.810
- Selective amnesia?
- Okay, exactly.

01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:45.290
I'm sorry. I need to tell you
something that is really important.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.710
- I was never...
- Pregnant?

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:52.180
We know. Jack called us.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.600
- Jack.
- Hey, so he's come out of it?

01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.580
I'm so glad you're here, honey.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.729
Excuse me, Doctor?
He's up again.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.500
All right, let's go.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.060
Jack.
I'm so glad you're here.

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:06.970
- Saul.
- Now, now, listen. Let me handle it.

01:09:07.069 --> 01:09:09.930
I'm too old a friend and too old a person
for them to kill.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:11.680
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.520
- And I'll do it right now. Come on.
- Okay.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.180
I'm right behind you.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.040
- How you feeling, champ?
- I don't know.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.120
Hi.

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:23.840
Hey, remember her?

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:29.550
- Should I?
- Look closely.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.170
She looks a little familiar.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.880
- Why?
- I think it's coming back.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:41.050
- I think so.
- What's coming back? Tell me.

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:43.520
- Tell me. What?
- Peter, you have amnesia.

01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:45.069
I do?

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:47.609
Peter, you're engaged.

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.970
- To who?
- To Lucy.

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:52.410
Lucy. Who's Lucy?

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.100
You don't remember, do you?

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.170
Excuse me.
Got some Jell-O for you today.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.590
Do I like Jell-O?

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:02.400
I think he's had enough excitement
for one evening.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.610
- Let's all go home.
- Hang in there, champ.

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:07.330
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.

01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:10.290
- It's so good to see you.
- Mom.

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:12.910
- He looks so good, you know?
- He's going to be fine.

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.670
- I think he looked wonderful.
- All right, we'll be back.

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:17.770
Jack, you, too. Come on.
Let's go home.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.880
Saul, where have you been?

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.840
What?
I'm not allowed to go to the bathroom?

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:25.890
- Saul.
- I'm handling it.

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:27.760
- I will tell them.
- When? When?

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.860
On my golden anniversary?

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.930
- Lucy, I'll tell them.
- You better tell them.

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.880
I said I'd tell them.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.120
<i>~ A, B, C, D, E, F, G ~</i>

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:13.040
Jack, you've been really great
this week.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.210
Yeah, like when I accused
you of lying to everybody.

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:23.720
Or when I accused you
of having a relationship with Joe Jr.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.600
Or when I thought you were pregnant,
and I announced it to all your friends.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.060
You've had a really busy week
this week, haven't you?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.770
Look, Jack, I...

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:43.360
Starting tomorrow, things are
probably gonna be kind of different.

01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:45.950
Yeah.

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.440
I just wanted you to know
that you've become

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.050
a really good friend.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.180
Okay.

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.100
Good friend.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.100
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:15.300
I didn't mean what I said
about you and Peter.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.360
I think you two are gonna
make a really terrific couple.

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:23.240
And I'm really glad
that you won't be alone anymore.

01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:30.150
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.430
Jack?
Is that you?

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:24.640
Hey, Pop.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.650
- Brought you some donuts.
- You're a savior.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.950
Your mother's got me eating
these fat-free bran muffins.

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.950
They taste like plywood.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.020
Catching up?

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.240
It's been almost a week
since I read the obituaries.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.960
You know, we missed a lot of good
stuff the day after Christmas.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.380
Been a hell of a week, hasn't it?

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.630
Life is a pain in the ass. I'll tell you.

01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:55.850
You know, you work hard,
try to provide for the family,

01:13:56.710 --> 01:14:00.270
and then for one minute,
everything's good.

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:04.860
Everyone's well, everyone's happy.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.070
In that one minute, you have peace.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.360
Pop.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.570
This isn't that minute.

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:17.620
What do you mean?

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:25.050
You remember that rocking chair
I made for Grandma?

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:26.740
Are you kidding me?

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.880
It's so fancy, she won't even sit in it.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:32.410
This fancy chair, two months ago,
I sold three just like it.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.600
I've sold two dining tables.
I got orders for six more.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.940
Well, that's a good side business.

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:41.910
It's not a side business.
This is good business.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.780
Wait a second.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.400
You don't want my business?

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.160
No, I don't.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.090
- How long have you felt this way?
- A long time.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.630
Well, why didn't you say
something sooner?

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.850
I could have sold the whole damn thing
to Uncle Eddy for twice its value.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.390
I could have taken your mother on
the cruise with Kathie Lee Gifford.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.770
You're not mad at me?

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.770
Are you nuts?

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:26.110
You are nuts.
You wanna make rocking chairs.

01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:31.410
Hey, Mrs. Fletcher finally went?

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.310
Her dining room alone
has got to be worth 40 grand.

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:36.560
Yeah.
Those McMurphy boys,

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.900
they were moving in
before the deed was done.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.650
That's their problem. They're too pushy.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.120
- They're pushy, aren't they?
- We'll call them next week.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.840
You call them next week.

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:48.140
That's right, I'll call them next week.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.270
Yeah.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:51.860
- Do I get a donut?
- I'm sorry.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.250
22, 10, 40.
Eighth-grade locker combination.

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.010
Birth date, 3-11-59.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:59.670
You have to remember Lucy.

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.930
Social security number, 144-60-6894.

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:06.400
You love her. You just don't remember.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:09.450
Three-point-seven-three grade point
average, Northwestern University.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.040
Can I talk to Peter alone?

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:14.540
- Everything okay, Saul?
- Senior class president, 1981.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.410
I just wanna talk to my godson.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.900
- Let me take that for you.
- Thanks.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.850
- We'll be back.
- We'll see you later.

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:22.240
- You sure, Saul?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:23.990
- See you, son.
- See you, Dad.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.590
Peter, I've known you
since you were born.

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:32.800
I've been to every major event
in your life from Cub Scouts to...

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.140
Well, to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel.

01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:39.440
You've got a good education.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.000
You're very popular
with all those friends of yours.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.100
You make a nice living.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.030
And everybody knows
you're a good-looking kid.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.530
But, Peter, you're a putz.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.660
Excuse me?

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.520
Now, look, I'm your godfather.
I mean, I love you.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.290
I couldn't love you any more
if you were my own son.

01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:03.130
But the fact of the matter is you're...

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.800
Well, you're a putz.

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:08.130
Is there a point to this?

01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:10.010
Lucy.

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.980
Peter, there's something
you have to know about her.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:18.770
You see, she...

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.690
Well...

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.030
She's...

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.700
You know...

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.310
She's not only your fiancée,
she's your guardian angel.

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:38.710
Yeah.
Peter, she saved your life.

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.840
Now, she's coming to see you today,

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:43.960
and I want you to do yourself a favor.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.800
I want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.220
who has just been given
a second chance at life.

01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:54.930
And after two minutes,
if you're not madly in love with her,

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.810
why, tell her you wanna break up.

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.230
And you can go back to being a putz.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.030
But if in the two minutes,

01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:04.860
you see what the rest of us
only took seconds to see,

01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:08.220
you will propose to her
for the second time,

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.080
and marry her
before she has a chance to escape.

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:18.570
Before she comes, take a little time

01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:22.240
and think about
what an old putz just told you.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.760
All right?

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.970
You know, if I was 40 years younger,
I'd marry her myself.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.520
That is, if she'd convert.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.770
- Hey, that's a joke.
- I know.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.340
Lucy.

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:02.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:08.770
I came to bring you back your things.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:10.810
Would you like a sandwich?

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:16.110
No, no. I'm okay, thanks.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.480
Can I get you anything?

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.240
I wish I had my own clothes.

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:22.490
Well, I like your blue pinstripe.

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:23.950
- Double-breasted?
- Yeah.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.560
- That's my favorite.
- Really?

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.710
Yeah.

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.400
Please sit down.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.870
I saw a picture of you
when you saved the three squirrels.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.920
They never call, they never write.

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:50.780
That was a long time ago.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.510
Yeah, I guess we don't get to do
many heroic things as an adult.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.640
That's for sure.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.550
You do, though.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:02.270
No. Jumping in front of
that train was unusual.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.440
I don't think I've done anything
truly heroic my whole life.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:09.360
I chased a purse snatcher once.

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:11.240
Well, that's something.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:13.200
I pretended to pull a hamstring.

01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:17.650
Well, most guys probably wouldn't have
chased after him in the first place.

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:19.880
I mean, I work at the L.
Believe me, I know.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.170
You give up your seat
every day in the train.

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:25.800
Well...

01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.180
That's not heroic.

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.720
It is to the person who sits in it.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.020
And you always gave me something
to look forward to every day, so...

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.940
You know, you do remind me of someone.

01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:43.740
It's probably you.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:55.410
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
What apartment?

01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:59.840
- You're new.
- Yes, ma'am. What apartment?

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.740
I'm going to Peter Callaghan's
apartment.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.450
And your name, please?

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:06.430
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
I am Peter's fiancée.

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.510
You're not his fiancée.

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:14.880
Hey, looking good.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.130
Yeah, well, they're moving
me to the second floor.

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:19.470
Great. Mind if I drove?

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:21.800
No problem. See you by the elevators.

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.280
All right. Okay. There we go.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.220
It's a little drafty.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.910
Here, I brought you some contraband.

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.540
Chocolate peanut butter. Thanks.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.110
Hey, Lucy's pretty terrific, isn't she?

01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:38.630
- Yeah.
- We're engaged, you know.

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:41.380
Yeah, I heard that.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.280
Now, this, I remember.

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.560
Everything is better.
Everything looks better, feels better.

01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:50.850
Even this chocolate peanut
butter tastes better.

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.600
Good. It's fudge mint.

01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:56.400
Whatever. I'm reborn.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.300
If you were a priest right now,
I'd confess everything to you.

01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:01.880
No, no, don't confess.
I'm trying to be positive right now.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.310
Just eat your ice cream.

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:05.940
I don't know what my secretary
sent Mom and Dad for Christmas.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.120
It was a fruit basket.
Now, look, I don't wanna...

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.600
- I've never been faithful.
- I'm gonna leave.

01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:12.830
Remember the squirrels?

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.170
Don't even say it.

01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:19.340
First I knocked them out
of their nest with a rock.

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:21.840
Peter.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.550
Then I saved them.

01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:26.620
Did you say any of this to Lucy?

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.420
That was in the past.
I'm making a clean start with Lucy.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.770
She is... She is... She...

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.190
What is she?
She's...

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:41.720
I'd say that she gets under your skin
as soon as you meet her.

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.060
She drives you so nuts,

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.200
you don't know whether to hug her
or just really arm-wrestle her.

01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:51.670
She would go all the way to Europe
just to get a stamp in her passport.

01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.530
I don't know if that amounts to insanity

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:58.420
or just being really, really likeable.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.890
No, that's not it.

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:06.560
But she's gotta be really special.
She's gotta be.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.150
And I can spend the rest of my life
finding out why.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.730
I don't have to know now,
I don't have to know tomorrow.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.650
I don't have to know in a year,
or 10 years.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.830
I don't have to...

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:21.870
I don't have to have
all the answers today, or...

01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:23.230
Maybe someday I'll have a clue,

01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:27.080
but it doesn't mean I can't
make a lifetime commitment.

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.210
Does this make any sense?

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:33.750
Not really, but that's
common after a head injury.

01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:35.590
My shoes.

01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:40.260
- Hi.
- What'd they say?

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:43.430
- Who?
- The Callaghans. Are they inside?

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:44.970
You missed them.

01:23:45.170 --> 01:23:47.580
Well, what was their reaction
to the news?

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.510
- I didn't tell them yet.
- What do you mean, Saul?

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:53.510
- Now, what about Peter?
- Well, I didn't tell him either.

01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:55.280
What?
You said you were gonna handle this.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.970
- I'll handle it.
- This is handling it?

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.520
- This is handling it.
- Saul.

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.700
- What?
- You're fired.

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.290
Fired?

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.040
- Sorry.
- Pardon me.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.050
- Two, please.
- Four, please.

01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:29.130
<i>Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.</i>

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.900
<i>Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.</i>

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.990
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.950
- Ashley.
- Scumbag.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.370
You're engaged?

01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:45.480
May I remind you
that you proposed to me?

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.380
You said no. We broke up.

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.860
No, no. I was confused.
We stepped back.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.320
You moved to Portugal.

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.870
Yes, well, I didn't think
you were going to run out

01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:57.330
and marry the first bimbo
that you came across.

01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:58.770
Lucy's not a bimbo.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.110
Lucy?
Lucy who?

01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:03.300
I don't remember.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.750
Liar.

01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:09.690
I don't remember proposing.
I was in a coma, I have amnesia.

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:12.860
Amnesia?
Well, now, that's rich.

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.600
All right, fine.
I want my stuff back.

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.750
Fine.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:19.160
- Then I want my stuff back.
- What stuff?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.700
Your nose.

01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:23.480
You can't take my nose back.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.880
I paid for it.

01:25:25.150 --> 01:25:27.710
Well, then here. You paid for these, too.

01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:31.510
Keep them. I'm a changed man, Ashley.

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:37.810
Go ahead. Go ahead and marry her,
you one-balled bastard.

01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:46.780
Holy buckets, Peter.
Moving on to greener pastures.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:48.610
Yeah.

01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.240
You got it, pal.

01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:52.930
- So we should come back later?
- Yes, the doctor...

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.060
- Lucy, they moved him.
- They moved him?

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.200
Come with me, downstairs.

01:25:58.110 --> 01:25:59.210
Lucy.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:00.920
What?

01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:03.820
- Lucy.
- Hi, Peter.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.060
My God, you look really good.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.710
I feel really good. You know what?

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.840
Facing death makes a man
evaluate his life.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.940
And I've been thinking about mine
and haven't liked what I've seen.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.600
I've seen a man who has
courtside tickets to the Bulls,

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.940
a lucrative investment portfolio.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:22.170
An apartment
on la rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:24.020
- Where?
- Paris.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.310
But I've also seen a man
who has no one to trust,

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.280
no one to wanna have a son with.

01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:31.950
You were there when I needed
someone the most.

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.160
You gave me a second chance at life.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:39.280
It took a coma to wake me up.
My family loves you.

01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:42.250
I might as well love you.

01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:44.560
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz,

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.290
will you marry me?

01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:52.050
Wanda?
Wanda, are you all right?

01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.810
Honey?
Wanda?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.210
Your hair is looking
very big tonight.

01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:00.300
Why, thank you.
I love your new cologne.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.010
Yeah, it's called Paris Guy.
It's from France.

01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:04.200
- Nice.
- How you doing?

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.610
- Hey, are you going to see Lucy?
- Yeah.

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.350
She is the best-looking chick
in this building.

01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:11.500
Hey.

01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:17.020
But you are the best-looking chick
on the third floor.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.580
- Joe Jr.
- Phyllis.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.390
No?
This one?

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:29.970
This one?

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.460
I don't want any flowers from you,

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.670
I am not wearing black underwear,

01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:39.480
and I definitely do not wanna
move in with you...

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.940
Jack.

01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.050
Well, I don't have any flowers,

01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:45.880
I wouldn't mind
seeing the black underwear,

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.130
but under the circumstances, I don't
think we should move in together.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.130
- I thought you were Joe Jr.
- I get that a lot.

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:01.340
Do you wanna come in?

01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:02.720
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.890
Wow. So that's the wedding dress?

01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:15.940
The wedding dress.

01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:19.820
It works good as a tie, too.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.700
Yeah.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.480
I just wanted to give you this

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.240
before all the presents
started to pile up.

01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:32.110
I was dropping off some
furniture in Little Italy,

01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:34.170
I look in a window, and...

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.640
Florence.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.060
Thank you. It's really beautiful.

01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:56.480
And I wanted to say that I think that

01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.780
Peter is a very lucky guy.

01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.230
Thank you.

01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:07.950
I had to say that because
you're gonna be my sister-in-law.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.870
Ha, ha, ha.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.960
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.050
- I'd better get going.
- Yeah.

01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:27.270
Hey, Jack?

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.640
- Jack.
- Yeah?

01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:36.070
Can you give me any reason
why I shouldn't marry your brother?

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.410
I can't.

01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:09.210
- What's this?
- It's a wedding invitation.

01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:13.020
Wait a minute.
This is your wedding invitation.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.360
So?

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.610
Whom are we marrying?

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.740
Jerry, Peter Callaghan.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.520
The coma guy?
Are you insane?

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:25.150
Yes, Jerry, I'm insane.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.520
Every day I go and I sit in a booth
like a veal.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:32.100
I work every holiday, I go home to a cat.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.480
And now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him,

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:36.690
and I have said yes.

01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:39.940
Okay, okay, that makes me
a raving, total lunatic.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.070
The wedding is tomorrow, Lucy.

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:45.410
I know it's tomorrow, Jerry.
But I even wish it were yesterday.

01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:48.810
That would mean that today
that I would be on my honeymoon,

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.170
that I would finally have a stamp
in my passport,

01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:53.520
and that it would say Italy on it.

01:30:57.010 --> 01:30:58.900
What happened with the other guy?

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.140
He didn't want me.

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.930
- Maybe she forgot.
- A woman doesn't forget her wedding.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.850
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.580
- This isn't... Does this look ridiculous?
- No, you look fine.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:27.800
- All right. Well, you got the rings?
- Yeah, I got the rings.

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.840
What's the matter with you, Jack?

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.690
You suck.

01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:36.570
I suck or the outfit sucks?

01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:38.490
It's a toss-up.

01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:40.450
What do you mean?

01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:45.450
Here she is.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.380
She's a little nervous.

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:12.110
She's lovely.

01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:40.040
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join...

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.480
I object.

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.900
I didn't get to that part yet.

01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:50.030
I would have to object, too.

01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:52.450
What about you?

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:56.030
- I'm thinking.
- What the hell is going on?

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:03.040
I am in love with your son.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.670
- I know.
- Not that one.

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.840
That one.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:13.080
Jack, what the hell did you do?

01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:16.330
He didn't do anything.
He didn't do anything.

01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:18.520
It was me. It was all me.

01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:22.020
Elsie, how are you doing?
You doing okay?

01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:26.800
Do you remember
that day at the hospital?

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:28.870
Of course you remember
that day at the hospital.

01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:31.560
Well, there was a little mix-up.

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:35.870
I saw Peter get pushed onto the tracks,
and I saved his life.

01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:39.310
But when I got to the hospital,
they wouldn't let me see him,

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:45.050
so someone told the doctor
that I was his fiancée.

01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:47.030
Only...

01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:49.880
It's not true.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.060
I was never engaged to Peter.

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.070
Why didn't you say something?

01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:06.320
Because I didn't know how to tell you.

01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:11.360
We never even met
until that day on the tracks.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.520
It's just when we were
in the hospital room,

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:17.690
everything happened so fast,
and I couldn't tell you the truth.

01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:20.280
And then I didn't wanna
tell you the truth,

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.630
because the truth was that

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.270
I fell in love with you.

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.930
You fell in love with me?

01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:32.430
No. No. Yes. All of you.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:38.190
I went from being all alone
to being a fiancée,

01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:42.690
a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister,

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.240
and a friend.

01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:49.100
I might have saved your life
on the tracks, but you know what?

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.120
You really saved mine.

01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:54.200
You allowed me
to be a part of your family.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.120
And I haven't had that
in a really long time.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.460
And I just didn't wanna let go of that.

01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:06.500
So even though
it was just for a little while,

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.640
I will love them always.

01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:14.140
I'm very sorry.

01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.230
And I'm very sorry about your carpet.

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:26.640
What about my carpet?

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.100
Peter Callaghan is engaged to me.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.830
I object to this wedding.

01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:32.170
Get in line.

01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:33.980
And I object to your objection.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.150
Who's that?

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:36.630
Ashley's husband.

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.250
You proposed to a married woman?

01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:43.170
Yes, and I was in a coma
when my brother makes a play for my...

01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:44.950
Sort of my fiancée.

01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:48.260
- Peter, how could you do this?
- Listen, a deal is a deal.

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:51.020
You two are better off together.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.100
Stop yelling.

01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:57.690
Hey.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:00.360
Hold on.
Hold on, just hold it right there.

01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:25.390
Hey, Luce.

01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:29.830
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:32.140
things didn't work out with that guy.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.800
And, you know, right now,
you should get in touch

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.400
with the child within

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.200
and explore your feminine side.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.190
And, you know, don't start eating
cookies and cake and stuff like that,

01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:53.580
because you'll blow up
like my Aunt Roberta, you know?

01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:57.760
You deserve better than that.

01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:09.230
So how are things going
with Miss Third Floor?

01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:11.770
She's...

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.820
- Joey, Joey.
- She said that I...

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.600
- What?
- Do you have any cookies?

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.310
No. You know what?

01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:25.790
- We can try on some of my shoes.
- Okay.

01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.100
- Hey. Last day?
- Yeah.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.210
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:42.920
- We'll see each other.
- You better.

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.520
- Of course.
- All right?

01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:47.020
- Bye.
- See you.

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.000
Lucy?

01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:17.220
I need to ask you a question.

01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:21.510
Get down on your knee.
It's more romantic.

01:38:21.670 --> 01:38:24.130
He's proposing. Let him do it.

01:38:24.230 --> 01:38:26.520
I am letting him do it.

01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:34.610
Can I come in there, please?

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.620
I can't.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.080
Not without a token.

01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:56.330
He just put the token in.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.260
Really?
I didn't notice.

01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:03.560
Marry me?

01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:05.310
Yeah.

01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:07.940
I love you.

01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:10.780
I love you back.

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:19.410
- That's nice.
- I'm so happy.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.780
<i>So I had planned to marry</i>
<i>Peter, but I married Jack instead.</i>

01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.380
<i>Thank goodness my father was right.</i>

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.940
<i>Life doesn't always turn out</i>
<i>the way you plan.</i>

01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:49.740
<i>But Jack, Jack gave me the perfect gift,</i>

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.240
<i>a stamp in my passport.</i>

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.910
<i>He took me to Florence</i>
<i>for our honeymoon.</i>

01:39:55.690 --> 01:39:57.990
<i>I guess you might say</i>
<i>he gave me the world.</i>

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.040
<i>Peter once asked me when</i>
<i>it was that I fell in love with Jack.</i>

01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:04.790
<i>And I told him,</i>

01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:07.190
<i>"It was while you were sleeping."</i>

01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:30.930
<i>~ When my world is turnin' ~</i>

01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:34.880
<i>~ When it's turnin'</i>
<i>upside down ~</i>

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:39.900
<i>~ When all I see is rain ~</i>

01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:44.610
<i>~ When I think</i>
<i>the night won't end ~</i>

01:40:44.710 --> 01:40:48.230
<i>~ I just think of you ~</i>

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.910
<i>~ And I can see</i>
<i>the sun again ~</i>

01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:59.210
<i>~ Ooh, wherever would I be ~</i>

01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:01.800
<i>~ Without ya ~</i>

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:05.300
<i>~ - If I didn't have you</i>
<i>- If I didn't have you ~</i>

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.050
<i>~ Whatever would</i>
<i>I do now, baby ~</i>

01:41:09.150 --> 01:41:13.890
<i>~ Wherever would I be</i>
<i>without ya ~</i>

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:17.190
<i>~ - I'd be nowhere</i>
<i>- Nowhere ~</i>

01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:21.440
<i>~ - I'd be nowhere</i>
<i>- Nowhere ~</i>

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:24.150
<i>~ When the dreams I dream</i>
<i>all seem ~</i>

01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:27.730
<i>~ A million miles away ~</i>

01:41:29.010 --> 01:41:32.370
<i>~ When I'm sure</i>
<i>I'll never win ~</i>

01:41:34.770 --> 01:41:37.920
<i>~ When it's lookin' like</i>
<i>I lost my faith ~</i>

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:41.920
<i>~ - I just look at you, baby</i>
<i>- Baby ~</i>

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:46.430
<i>~ And I got reason</i>
<i>to believe again ~</i>

01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:51.760

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:53.930

01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:57.900

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.690
<i>~ Whatever would</i>
<i>I do now, baby ~</i>

01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:06.480

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:17.180
<i>~ Without you ~</i>

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.830
<i>~ - To love me</i>
<i>- To love me ~</i>

01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:23.000
<i>~ Just be wastin' time ~</i>

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:29.390
<i>~ - Goin' out of my mind</i>
<i>- My mind ~</i>

01:42:29.490 --> 01:42:35.390
<i>~ Wherever would I be</i>
<i>without you ~</i>

01:42:35.490 --> 01:42:38.940
