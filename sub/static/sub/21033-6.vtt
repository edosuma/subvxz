00:01.624 --> 00:03.124
SCOTT: This weather
is amazing, Hope.

00:03.124 --> 00:04.874
Forget the movie,
let's go on a picnic.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.416
It'll be
the perfect first date.

00:06.416 --> 00:07.915
No, no,
this is not a date.

00:07.915 --> 00:09.790
Oh, yeah,
first date fist bump.

00:09.790 --> 00:12.041
Scott, this,
this is a date.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.874
This right here,
not so much.

00:13.874 --> 00:15.041
I'm not following you here.

00:15.790 --> 00:18.333
What? Is that a tornado?

00:18.333 --> 00:20.249
That's no ordinary tornado.

00:20.249 --> 00:22.582
It's Whirlwind,
one of my dad's enemies.

00:22.582 --> 00:24.915
He's coming for me.
Good thing I brought my suit.

00:24.915 --> 00:26.790
You brought your suit
on our date?

00:26.790 --> 00:28.582
That's sweet.
I brought mine too.

00:28.582 --> 00:30.333
(LAUGHING)

00:30.333 --> 00:33.832
WHIRLWIND: Hope,
kidnapping you is going
to make me rich.

00:34.624 --> 00:36.083
Damsel in distress date.

00:36.915 --> 00:38.832
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

00:38.832 --> 00:41.208
What? Oh, no, no.
Scott, stop.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.041
(GRUNTING)

00:50.666 --> 00:51.666
Oh!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Uh...

01:01.541 --> 01:02.499
(SCREAMS)

01:02.499 --> 01:03.208
Take that!

01:04.624 --> 01:05.915
(LAUGHING)

01:05.915 --> 01:07.666
Huh? (SCREAMING)

01:10.041 --> 01:11.208
WASP: Scott! Fist bump!

01:11.208 --> 01:13.041
Huh?
WASP: Fist bump, now!

01:13.041 --> 01:14.041
Okay! Okay!

01:14.041 --> 01:15.083
(GRUNTS)

01:17.541 --> 01:19.124
(GRUNTING)

01:21.790 --> 01:23.041
I punched a tornado,
did you see?

01:23.041 --> 01:23.874
WASP: I did.

01:23.874 --> 01:24.957
Double fist bump?

01:24.957 --> 01:26.041
Hmm.

01:26.041 --> 01:27.333
I knew it was a date!

01:27.333 --> 01:29.957
HOPE: Scott, no. Just no.
