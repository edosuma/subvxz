WEBVTT

00:05.731 --> 00:08.781
I'm watching your commercial
for the Shake Weight?

00:09.599 --> 00:10.632
I gotta tell ya,

00:10.757 --> 00:14.341
my brother does basically the same thing
in the shower every day

00:16.045 --> 00:19.045
and he has absolutely
no muscle tone in his arms.

00:20.030 --> 00:22.774
- All right, I'm out of here.
- Hold on a sec.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.024
What does this look like to you,
Berta?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.859
Your brother in the shower?

00:28.599 --> 00:30.699
You hear that? It's not just me.

00:33.142 --> 00:35.403
Thanks, Berta.
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:36.034 --> 00:37.234
No, you won't.

00:38.078 --> 00:41.165
I told you, I'm going
to a family reunion for a few days.

00:42.255 --> 00:44.043
But what about me?

00:45.536 --> 00:46.536
All right,

00:46.945 --> 00:48.840
let's go through this one more time.

00:53.165 --> 00:55.200
I arranged to have a friend

00:55.483 --> 00:56.733
fill in for me.

00:57.122 --> 00:59.183
Her name is Esmerelda.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.135
I have given her
detailed instructions

01:02.260 --> 01:04.230
about how you like things done
around here.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.404
Did you tell her
to roll me over on my stomach

01:06.529 --> 01:08.679
so I don't choke on my own vomit?

01:10.679 --> 01:12.679
That's number one on the list.

01:14.197 --> 01:16.492
- Is she hot?
- She was in the '70s.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.661
I guess it's better that way.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.497
It's tough enough
that you and I have sexual tension.

01:24.096 --> 01:26.696
By the way,
you promised me vacation pay.

01:30.489 --> 01:32.239
How much did we agree on?

01:33.113 --> 01:34.763
That looks about right.

01:38.089 --> 01:39.307
See you tomorrow.

01:45.143 --> 01:46.396
Uncle Charlie in there?

01:47.262 --> 01:48.062
Drunk?

01:48.187 --> 01:49.187
Hammered.

01:50.207 --> 01:53.657
- You clean him out?
- Would I do that to my little buddy?

01:54.115 --> 01:55.448
Thank you, Berta.

01:57.203 --> 01:58.910
Have a good weekend, Uncle Charlie.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.878
Enjoy your family reunion.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.834
You still owe me for that pizza
from the other night.

02:08.207 --> 02:09.507
Oh, yeah, sorry.

02:11.026 --> 02:13.150
- How much was it?
- That'll do it.

02:14.947 --> 02:16.780
Jake, let's go. Your mom's outside.

02:16.905 --> 02:19.389
- See ya, Uncle Charlie.
- See ya, buddy.

02:19.686 --> 02:21.118
Thanks for the pizza.

02:22.222 --> 02:25.101
- When did you guys have pizza?
- I have no idea.

02:30.779 --> 02:32.329
You remember Lyndsey?

02:37.828 --> 02:38.828
Look!

02:45.235 --> 02:46.485
I'm exercising.

02:49.231 --> 02:51.045
Maybe you ought to sit down
for a minute.

02:51.964 --> 02:52.964
Good idea.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.508
I'm getting a little dizzy.

02:55.690 --> 02:57.558
I hope I don't have a heart problem.

02:57.683 --> 02:59.783
No, you have a drinking problem.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.981
That's a relief.

03:03.418 --> 03:04.927
So who's this Lyndsey?

03:05.052 --> 03:08.610
You remember...
Lyndsey, early 40s, blonde, pretty.

03:09.629 --> 03:10.929
No recollection.

03:11.442 --> 03:12.942
I burned her house down.

03:13.273 --> 03:15.236
She left me,
went back to her ex-husband?

03:15.708 --> 03:16.758
Keep going.

03:18.056 --> 03:20.956
Nice, full,
very natural looking C-cup?

03:21.081 --> 03:22.531
Oh, right, Lyndsey.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.420
Here we go.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.257 --> 03:35.548
What are you doing?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.883
Child-proofing you.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.399
So you're dating Lindsay Lohan?

03:44.075 --> 03:45.625
No, Lyndsey MacElroy.

03:46.090 --> 03:49.311
Anyway, she called and apparently things
aren't working out with the ex-husband,

03:49.436 --> 03:51.228
and even though
she didn't exactly say

03:51.353 --> 03:53.316
she wanted to get back together,
I am meeting her.

03:53.679 --> 03:55.651
Well, that's great.
Good for you.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.812
How do I look?

03:59.962 --> 04:02.492
Like Lance Armstrong
after a three-day drunk.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.877
Nice.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.920
You are a good brother, Alan.

04:10.348 --> 04:11.648
Have some money.

04:13.224 --> 04:14.224
Thanks.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.923
If I were really a good brother,
I would stage an intervention.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.774
Thanks for the pizza.

04:34.001 --> 04:35.001
Eureka.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.567
I've invented the drinking helmet.

05:04.783 --> 05:05.783
Hello?

05:16.407 --> 05:18.707
Man, did I go to Tijuana last night?

05:23.267 --> 05:25.006
Me, you...

05:26.102 --> 05:27.602
Not married, are we?

05:33.966 --> 05:37.128
I guess if the answer was yes,
she wouldn't be polishing the piano.

05:43.146 --> 05:44.396
Quick question.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.931
Who is that in our living room?

05:48.099 --> 05:49.099
That's Esmerelda.

05:49.508 --> 05:50.808
Gonna need more.

05:51.862 --> 05:53.853
- Berta's friend?
- Keep going.

05:54.342 --> 05:57.190
Berta went to her family reunion.
Esmerelda's filling in for her.

05:59.119 --> 06:01.415
It would have been nice
if she'd given me a heads-up.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.948
Aren't you going to ask me
about last night?

06:08.119 --> 06:09.861
What did I do last night?

06:11.304 --> 06:13.921
Somehow I spent almost all my money.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.876
No, I meant what I did last night.

06:20.469 --> 06:22.465
Lyndsey wants to get back together.

06:23.314 --> 06:25.214
- C-cups.
- Right, Lyndsey.

06:26.962 --> 06:29.105
She did split up
with her ex-husband Chris.

06:29.230 --> 06:31.516
Said she realized
she didn't want to go backwards.

06:32.077 --> 06:34.894
In what universe is dating you
not going backwards?

06:35.762 --> 06:38.010
I know.
This guy must be some kind of mess.

06:41.054 --> 06:42.277
Breakfast, Señor Harper?

06:42.703 --> 06:45.446
Why is she saying breakfast?
Am I supposed to make her breakfast?

06:46.608 --> 06:48.132
She'll make it for you.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.703
Try the <i>huevos rancheros</i>,
they're amazing.

06:58.187 --> 06:59.191
<i>Muy bien.</i>

07:00.596 --> 07:02.505
Where did you learn
to speak Spanish?

07:02.887 --> 07:04.815
Junior high, high school, college,

07:04.940 --> 07:07.640
two years of chiropractic school
in Mexico.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.597
You say
that like I'm supposed to know.

07:10.936 --> 07:13.182
You are supposed to know.
You're my brother.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.259
What's so funny?

07:40.384 --> 07:41.711
Are you talking about me?

07:41.879 --> 07:43.504
She says she likes your hat.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.776
Alan! Come here, quick!

07:53.723 --> 07:56.273
Please God,
don't let it be a dead girl.

08:00.319 --> 08:01.331
What is it?

08:01.456 --> 08:03.567
Open my door
and tell me what you see.

08:04.219 --> 08:05.219
Why?

08:05.292 --> 08:06.592
What do you see?

08:07.748 --> 08:08.748
Just look.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.950
- Are the flying monkeys back?
- Don't joke about that, Alan.

08:16.526 --> 08:18.783
- Esmerelda did this?
- Can you believe it?

08:18.908 --> 08:21.292
The fresh cut flowers,
the carafe of lemon water.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.156
She even laid out my robe
and slippers.

08:23.281 --> 08:25.164
- You have slippers?
- I don't know.

08:25.289 --> 08:26.965
Is it possible she made them?

08:28.843 --> 08:30.968
She put a chocolate on your pillow?

08:31.968 --> 08:33.104
See what it says?

08:33.229 --> 08:34.308
<i>Felicidad.</i>

08:34.634 --> 08:37.642
- That means "Merry Christmas", right?
- It means "happiness".

08:37.914 --> 08:40.812
You sure?
What about that song, <i>Felicidad Navidas</i> ?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.179
<i>Feliz Navidad?</i>

08:43.201 --> 08:44.756
Tomato, tamale.

08:45.536 --> 08:48.586
The point is,
Esmerelda is a terrific housekeeper.

08:49.011 --> 08:50.472
I didn't get a chocolate.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.074
- You're not Señor Harper.
- I'm a Señor Harper.

08:53.246 --> 08:55.451
Yes,
but not the Señor Harper that pays her.

08:57.038 --> 08:58.480
Come on, you got to see this.

08:59.141 --> 09:01.091
She still could have given me
a chocolate.

09:01.216 --> 09:02.866
How much could it cost?

09:03.357 --> 09:04.357
Look!

09:05.535 --> 09:07.785
That's not a swan. That's my towel.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.882
- Nice touch.
- Had me fooled at first.

09:11.007 --> 09:12.457
I tried to kill it.

09:13.923 --> 09:14.952
And look.

09:15.243 --> 09:17.306
She folded my toilet paper
into a little point.

09:18.292 --> 09:21.596
After breakfast, I used some, stood up,
shaved, and when I looked back,

09:21.721 --> 09:23.517
I swear it was pointed again.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.898
Is that a votive candle?

09:26.718 --> 09:28.909
She's praying
that I have pleasant bowel movements.

09:29.034 --> 09:30.712
- Oh, please.
- It's working.

09:30.966 --> 09:33.366
This morning,
soft, firm, easy peasy.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.980
But wait, there's more. Come on.

09:42.204 --> 09:43.624
She bought you a new grill?

09:43.793 --> 09:45.592
No, this is the old grill.

09:45.717 --> 09:48.504
- You know what she did? She cleaned it.
- What?

09:49.688 --> 09:51.924
She cleaned the grill?
Berta never cleans the grill.

09:52.241 --> 09:55.386
Tell me about it. She only comes out
on the deck to smoke pot.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.784
Señor Harper?

09:56.909 --> 09:58.929
She's talking to me, Baba Looey.

10:01.269 --> 10:02.685
Hell, yeah, <i>botanas</i>.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.953
- What's that mean, "screw you"?
- Basically.

10:13.053 --> 10:14.453
I love this woman.

10:14.578 --> 10:15.656
Esmerelda, <i>te amo</i>.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.874
- I thought you didn't speak Spanish.
- I don't.

10:19.999 --> 10:22.927
But I do know how to say I love you
and "How much for a happy ending"

10:23.052 --> 10:24.471
in 17 different languages.

10:24.596 --> 10:25.596
You're kidding.

10:30.634 --> 10:33.490
In case you ever wanna have
a good time in Central Africa.

10:39.620 --> 10:40.870
Alan, get that!

10:40.995 --> 10:42.517
Esmerelda's giving me a pedicure!

10:43.461 --> 10:45.843
Pedicure.
I can't even get a freakin' chocolate.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.148
Hello, Alan.

10:51.832 --> 10:52.902
What brings you by?

10:53.070 --> 10:55.527
Well, Lyndsey mentioned
that you two are dating again,

10:55.652 --> 10:58.950
and I wanted to let you know that if I
had to lose her, I'm glad it was to you.

10:59.786 --> 11:00.786
Thank you.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.601
How did you get my address?

11:03.258 --> 11:04.458
Not important.

11:04.657 --> 11:06.415
Here, I brought you a little gift.

11:09.847 --> 11:12.647
- Nothing in here's gonna bite me?
- Open it.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.587
Look at that.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.346
It's a picture of Lyndsey and you.

11:21.627 --> 11:23.132
Look how happy we were.

11:23.257 --> 11:25.174
We just found out she was pregnant.

11:25.299 --> 11:26.936
It looks like she's glowing,

11:27.104 --> 11:30.189
but it's just the lights from the
Ferris Wheel on the Santa Monica Pier.

11:31.645 --> 11:34.115
- I can't accept this.
- I want you to have it.

11:34.448 --> 11:38.281
You need to see how happy Lyndsey
made me, so you can be that happy.

11:39.077 --> 11:41.074
I'm not quite sure
I follow the logic...

11:41.495 --> 11:42.535
But thank you.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.953
See you around.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.248
It's too late, Alan.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.744
You're already dead.

12:01.115 --> 12:02.891
Well, that was a bit disturbing.

12:09.170 --> 12:12.323
Okay,
one decaf grande soy chai latte

12:12.448 --> 12:13.858
with extra whipped cream.

12:14.224 --> 12:15.902
And a black coffee for the lady.

12:17.096 --> 12:18.096
Thank you.

12:18.361 --> 12:20.681
- I don't know how you drink that stuff.
- Back at you.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.333
- Name?
- Alan.

12:23.347 --> 12:26.307
So, what's so important that you didn't
want to talk about it on the phone?

12:26.334 --> 12:28.873
It's not that it's important...
it's just that it's...

12:29.306 --> 12:31.946
If you dragged me down here to break up
with me, I will murder you.

12:32.548 --> 12:34.545
No, nobody's breaking up.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.232
But... speaking of murder,
I saw your ex-husband yesterday.

12:38.955 --> 12:40.849
I'm sorry, "speaking of murder"?

12:41.546 --> 12:43.279
Maybe I should back up a little.

12:43.758 --> 12:46.383
Chris showed up at my house
and handed me

12:46.546 --> 12:49.977
what I consider to be
a very inappropriate photo of you two.

12:50.767 --> 12:51.623
Bastard!

12:51.748 --> 12:53.794
He told me he threw
those pictures away.

12:54.778 --> 12:57.245
I don't think
we're talking about the same pictures.

12:57.489 --> 13:00.738
But the point is,
before he left, he shot at me.

13:01.666 --> 13:04.194
- He shot at you?
- Not with a gun, with his finger.

13:04.319 --> 13:06.285
But the implication was
pretty darn clear.

13:06.603 --> 13:08.258
Okay, let me get this straight.

13:08.581 --> 13:10.332
I wasn't naked in the picture?

13:10.852 --> 13:12.628
No,
you were at the Santa Monica Pier.

13:13.908 --> 13:15.355
But not naked, right?

13:16.486 --> 13:17.486
Right.

13:17.635 --> 13:21.456
But again, my concern here is that your
ex-husband seems to be threatening me.

13:22.374 --> 13:25.388
Chris is harmless.
His bark is way worse than his bite.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.223
So you're saying he does bite?

13:27.531 --> 13:29.393
Alan, you have nothing
to worry about.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.279
If it'll make you feel better,
I'll talk to Chris next time I see him.

13:32.474 --> 13:34.469
- Talk to me about what?
- What the hell?!

13:37.444 --> 13:39.764
- How long have you been sitting there?
- I just got here.

13:39.889 --> 13:42.551
I was gonna come say hi,
but I thought it was a little creepy

13:42.676 --> 13:44.476
ex-husband, new boyfriend.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.287
- You following us?
- No.

13:46.412 --> 13:48.202
I just stopped in
to have a cup of coffee.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.539
- You live on the other side of town.
- But I like the coffee here.

13:53.021 --> 13:55.180
Okay, I don't know
what you're trying to accomplish,

13:55.305 --> 13:58.604
- but it needs to stop right now.
- I've got this, Lyndsey.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.548
Now...

14:01.931 --> 14:03.017
listen up, pal.

14:04.590 --> 14:07.556
I'm dating your ex-wife,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

14:08.766 --> 14:11.048
Do you understand me?
Police! Police!

14:12.393 --> 14:13.393
Calm down.

14:13.982 --> 14:16.030
- Chris, get out of here.
- I'm leaving.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.608
- Oh, Alan.
- What?

14:20.019 --> 14:21.269
See you around.

14:21.702 --> 14:23.738
See? See? He shot me again!

14:24.004 --> 14:25.539
- Calm down.
- Calm down?!

14:25.664 --> 14:28.075
This guy is crazy. We need get
a restraining order.

14:28.244 --> 14:31.397
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Of course it's necessary.

14:31.522 --> 14:34.123
This is unacceptable behavior,
and I am not putting up with it.

14:34.292 --> 14:36.904
Forget the restraining order.
I'm gonna pay him a visit

14:37.029 --> 14:39.498
and make it crystal clear
that he is messing with the wrong guy.

14:39.522 --> 14:41.029
- Alan!
- Police! Police!

14:46.685 --> 14:48.485
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

14:48.824 --> 14:51.348
Breakfast time.
Esmerelda's huevos rancher...

14:52.134 --> 14:53.134
Berta!

14:53.817 --> 14:54.817
Hey.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.896
I thought you were
at a family reunion.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.563
Came home early.
Turns out, I don't like my family.

15:00.615 --> 15:01.776
So you came back.

15:02.412 --> 15:03.412
Yay.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.739
So
Esmerelda's not coming in anymore?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.257
No, I called her.

15:08.479 --> 15:10.326
She didn't mess things up too bad,
did she?

15:10.494 --> 15:13.576
No, no. I mean, she's not you,
so there was a little adjustment.

15:16.097 --> 15:18.426
- What's that you're eating?
- Western omelette.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.987
- Looks good.
- It is.

15:21.517 --> 15:23.339
Which reminds me,
you're out of eggs.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.882
- Charlie?
- In here.

15:27.391 --> 15:30.841
Staring at me while I eat is making me
very uncomfortable.

15:31.824 --> 15:33.413
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:33.935 --> 15:35.018
I've got a problem.

15:35.186 --> 15:37.603
How about that,
the problem's got a problem.

15:38.567 --> 15:39.620
Berta's back.

15:39.912 --> 15:40.912
Yay.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.744
I'm going somewhere
I can eat in peace.

15:44.213 --> 15:46.005
I thought my family was annoying.

15:47.317 --> 15:49.490
Can you believe it?
Esmerelda's gone.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.368
Yeah, boo-hoo. Lyndsey's ex-husband
threatened to kill me.

15:52.567 --> 15:55.127
How is that a bigger problem than me
having to make my breakfast?

15:55.693 --> 15:57.498
I'm serious, Charlie. He's crazy.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.708
Of course.
He's an ex-husband.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.779
The two words go together.
"Crazy ex-husband."

16:01.953 --> 16:03.835
- I'm an ex-husband.
- There you go.

16:04.402 --> 16:07.508
What we gonna do about Esmerelda?
It's not like I can fire Berta.

16:07.677 --> 16:09.913
Sure you can.
I never cared for the woman.

16:10.346 --> 16:13.347
What am I gonna do about Chris?
I don't wanna lose Lyndsey, I love her.

16:13.516 --> 16:17.347
And I love huevos rancheros and
chocolate "felicidadas" on my pillow.

16:17.937 --> 16:20.354
We seem to be talking
at cross purposes here.

16:20.523 --> 16:22.828
Cause you're not focusing
on the real issue.

16:22.969 --> 16:25.150
I've just lost the best housekeeper
since...

16:25.406 --> 16:26.582
Wilma Flintstone.

16:28.934 --> 16:30.134
What the hell?

16:30.896 --> 16:32.746
- What was that?
- A rock.

16:34.206 --> 16:35.369
It's gotta be Chris.

16:35.538 --> 16:38.081
- How can you be sure?
- Who else would throw a rock at me?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.404
Good point.
I'm here and Mom's out of town.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.250
I ain't cleaning that up.

16:52.568 --> 16:53.568
Hello.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.597
Hello?

17:05.089 --> 17:06.089
Hello?

17:07.405 --> 17:08.405
Hello?!

17:08.935 --> 17:09.935
Okay,

17:10.444 --> 17:12.942
whoever this is, you should know
that you're not scaring me.

17:20.654 --> 17:24.627
- Esmerelda! Come on in.
- Buenas noches, Señor Harper.

17:30.134 --> 17:31.633
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

17:33.262 --> 17:34.262
Esmerelda?

17:35.707 --> 17:36.931
Como esta, Señor Alan?

17:37.466 --> 17:39.391
Muy bien. Charlie, what's going on?

17:39.560 --> 17:40.560
Excusez-moi.

17:42.972 --> 17:45.852
From now on,
Berta will be our day housekeeper

17:45.977 --> 17:48.230
and Esmerelda will be
our night housekeeper.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.443
Capiche?

17:49.952 --> 17:52.269
- Does Berta know?
- Berta doesn't need to know.

17:52.490 --> 17:54.506
What's she gonna think
when she comes back

17:54.631 --> 17:56.912
and she sees the pointed toilet paper
and the swan towels?

17:57.078 --> 17:58.461
Way ahead of you. I'll just

17:58.586 --> 18:01.163
un-swan and un-point everything
before she gets here.

18:02.187 --> 18:03.253
Then why do it?

18:03.378 --> 18:05.879
Is it worth the trouble
to sneak around behind Berta's back?

18:06.493 --> 18:08.087
I know it's crazy, but...

18:10.130 --> 18:11.757
the woman makes me happy.

18:13.637 --> 18:14.927
Botanas, Señor Harper?

18:15.321 --> 18:17.373
Oh si... vous plaît.

18:20.926 --> 18:23.602
How about that? I'm even starting
to pick up the language.

18:24.462 --> 18:26.297
It's a shame the language is French.

18:39.550 --> 18:43.107
Alan, relax. If Chris wanna kill you,
he'd just climb through your window

18:43.232 --> 18:45.458
while you're sleeping
and smother you with a pillow.

18:46.653 --> 18:48.169
Thank you, very helpful.

18:48.337 --> 18:50.755
At least, that's
how I always imagined doing it.

18:51.142 --> 18:52.382
You rat bastard.

18:56.405 --> 18:58.678
- It's not what it looks like.
- Is that so?

18:59.161 --> 19:00.181
Then what is it?

19:02.351 --> 19:03.601
It's purely sexual.

19:06.119 --> 19:09.047
I'm not stupid, Charlie.
I know when I'm being two-timed.

19:09.437 --> 19:11.271
Charlie, I'm shocked. Shocked!

19:12.351 --> 19:13.945
I had no idea this was going...

19:14.113 --> 19:15.959
- Stay out of it, Zippy!
- I'm out.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.712
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Berta, I am so sorry.

19:20.837 --> 19:23.294
I got carried away, but I think
if we sit down like adults

19:23.419 --> 19:25.563
and talk this through,
we can make it work.

19:25.824 --> 19:27.083
It's either me or her.

19:27.564 --> 19:30.112
Please don't make me choose.
Berta, I love you both.

19:30.549 --> 19:32.999
- Good-bye, Charlie.
- No, wait, wait.

19:39.866 --> 19:41.022
It's you, Berta.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.891
It's always been you.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.853
I'm sorry. It's just not our time.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.982
Please tell her how sorry I am.

20:07.575 --> 20:09.368
Adios, Señor Harper.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.773
Arrivederci, Esmerelda.

20:14.769 --> 20:16.020
Okay, then.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.181
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good, good.

20:18.469 --> 20:20.419
- I'll be late.
- It's okay.

20:20.892 --> 20:23.642
You might want to clean that hair up
off the floor before I get in.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.476
- Sure, I'm on it.
- Okay.

20:33.735 --> 20:35.324
Oh, Esmerelda.

20:39.702 --> 20:41.225
No, I can't let her go.

20:47.544 --> 20:50.622
Hey, Chris. Pillows on the couch,
Alan's in his room. Esmerelda!
