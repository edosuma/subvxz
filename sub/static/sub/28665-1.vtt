what they're doing.

02:55.784 --> 02:56.828
We're fine.

02:56.872 --> 02:57.873
- They have to be
careful with it.

02:57.916 --> 02:58.961
Ah, da, da, da.

02:59.004 --> 02:59.918
- It's okay.

02:59.962 --> 03:00.963
Always expecting the worst.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.182
What a drama queen.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.444
It's fine.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.141
- My grandmother
gave me that piano.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.838
- I know, so why
don't you use it?

03:06.882 --> 03:09.580
- I do, I teach.

03:09.624 --> 03:10.929
- I mean your own music.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.193
- After the baby.

03:14.063 --> 03:14.933
- You're always saying that.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.587
- No, I'm, stop.

Aw, little Larissa.

03:54.843 --> 03:55.626
Ow.

03:56.584 --> 03:57.846
- Hey!

03:57.889 --> 03:59.021
what's wrong, what's wrong?

03:59.064 --> 04:00.283
- Oh my god.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.633
The baby just kicked
me really hard.

04:02.677 --> 04:03.678
- Yeah?

04:03.721 --> 04:04.461
- Yeah, right there.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.288
Feel that.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.726
- Wow, he's excited.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.771
- Strong.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.730
- Are you sure about all this?

04:12.774 --> 04:14.341
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.733
I mean, I think it's a little
late to be asking that now.

04:15.777 --> 04:18.954
- No, I just, you
know, new firm.

04:18.997 --> 04:19.737
- Don't worry about it.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.303
I can handle it.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.566
- But do you want this baby?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.655
- What a crazy question.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.310
Did you hear what
she just asked?

04:27.354 --> 04:29.747
[laughing]

04:29.791 --> 04:31.009
He says that was cold, mom.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.629
I like Colton, after your dad.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.239
That's really nice.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.153
We still need a middle name.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.633
- What about your dad's name?

04:45.676 --> 04:46.938
Clifford?

04:46.982 --> 04:49.201
No, I don't think so
cause he hates it.

04:49.245 --> 04:52.117
What about Francis
after my cousin?

04:52.161 --> 04:53.118
- Oh yeah.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.685
He was so sweet.

04:54.729 --> 04:55.773
- Yeah.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.036
- Colton Francis Kane.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.299
- Yeah.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.212
- It's actually really good.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.736
It really is.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.955
Do you know how much I love you?

05:03.999 --> 05:04.782
- Yeah.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.089
- Can I show you?

05:07.132 --> 05:10.614
No, come on, I look
like a beached whale.

05:10.658 --> 05:11.833
- We like whales.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.051
- Yeah.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.139
- And we donated to
that charity, remember?

05:14.183 --> 05:15.445
- Mm-hmm.

05:17.621 --> 05:18.840
- [Jessica] So how's Matthew?

05:18.883 --> 05:20.102
Is he still nervous
about being a father?

05:20.145 --> 05:21.495
- Terrified.

05:21.538 --> 05:25.890
Speaking of Matthew,
we had sex tonight.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.806
- So, Colton's gonna spend his
whole childhood in therapy.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.765
- Are you saying we
did something wrong?

05:30.808 --> 05:32.332
- I'm joking, lighten up.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.116
- Dr. Chan said
that it was okay.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.858
- And it is okay,
you worry too much?

05:36.901 --> 05:38.338
[sighing]

05:38.381 --> 05:39.948
- You still plan on being
here for the birth, right?

05:39.991 --> 05:41.471
- [Jessica] Yeah, of course.

05:45.257 --> 05:49.087
- Hey, baby hasn't kicked
for a couple hours.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.175
Maybe something's wrong.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.089
- Oh, no, no.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.656
I'm sure he's just tired.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.658
He's probably listening
to the doctor's advice,

05:54.702 --> 05:56.356
nothing strenuous, remember?

05:56.399 --> 05:57.531
- What if something's wrong?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.054
- Everything's
gonna be all right.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.012
- Where'd you get this?

06:01.056 --> 06:02.536
That I stole from the

06:02.579 --> 06:03.493
[throat clearing]

06:03.537 --> 06:04.755
neighbor's yard.

06:04.799 --> 06:05.800
- You stole it?

06:05.843 --> 06:06.844
- Risked my life.

06:06.888 --> 06:07.628
- Wow.

06:07.671 --> 06:08.759
- See what I do for you?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.239
I'm off.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.763
Okay My dad texted me, wants
me to meet him outside.

06:12.807 --> 06:13.721
- Outside?

06:13.764 --> 06:14.504
- Yeah.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.679
- Everything okay?

06:15.723 --> 06:16.811
Yeah, you know my dad.

06:16.854 --> 06:17.681
He's always okay.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.771
- Thanks for breakfast.

06:20.815 --> 06:21.859
- [Matt] My pleasure.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.437
Hey.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.395
- [Clifford] Hey.

06:35.438 --> 06:36.308
- Still working the night shift?

06:36.352 --> 06:37.440
- [Clifford] Somebody has to.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.310
- So, what's up?

06:38.354 --> 06:40.878
- I went shopping.

06:41.879 --> 06:42.967
- Oh my god.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.316
[laughing]

06:44.360 --> 06:45.361
Were you like this
when I was a kid?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.275
- Oh, worse.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.625
- So this is what you do, huh?

06:48.669 --> 06:50.584
What if I suck at being a dad?

06:50.627 --> 06:51.889
- Suck, how're you gonna suck?

06:51.933 --> 06:53.587
Anyway, I got your back.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.806
- Yeah, at first
I, I would prefer

06:55.850 --> 06:58.766
to wait a couple years
for the whole baby thing.

06:58.809 --> 07:01.725
But now I gotta say,
I'm really excited.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.901
I know there'll be some
changes and few adjustments.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.294
- Whoa, not a few changes.

07:05.337 --> 07:08.340
Everything, trust me,
everything's gonna change.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.647
[laughing]

07:12.910 --> 07:15.478
- That's why my client's
willing to settle.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.653
Let me just draft
up the paperwork.

07:16.697 --> 07:17.959
Take a look at it.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.177
Okay, thank you.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.788
- Latte, double espresso.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.834
- Carol, thank you.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.749
This is the fourth day in a row.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.491
You're an intern.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.579
You really shouldn't
be doing this for me.

07:31.233 --> 07:31.973
Thank you.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.208
I'm Larissa, just moved in.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.602
What's your name?

07:54.212 --> 07:55.170
- Ann.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.955
- Ann, nice to meet you.

07:57.999 --> 08:02.743
It's a boy, due in
four weeks, six days,

08:02.786 --> 08:05.180
eight hours and two minutes.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.529
At least that's
what we're hoping.

08:09.837 --> 08:10.620
Ow!

Here, call 911.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.990
We need to stop the bleeding.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.035
Blood pressure's dropping.

08:35.078 --> 08:36.864
- [Nurse] I've lost
the baby's pulse.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.256
Code blue, code blue.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.910
We have a code blue in OR two.

[eerie atmospheric music]

08:50.921 --> 08:53.750
[heart beating]

08:54.882 --> 08:56.013
- It's eclampsia.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.103
She spent a full
minute clinically dead.

08:59.147 --> 09:03.151
You need to know there may
be some residual effects.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.326
- What about the baby?

09:06.110 --> 09:09.461
- [Doctor] I'm sorry.

09:09.505 --> 09:12.421
[machines beeping]

09:20.037 --> 09:21.038
- I wanna see my baby.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.306
- Sweetheart,

09:31.005 --> 09:32.963
I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.138
I saw it.

09:34.182 --> 09:34.878
- It?

09:34.922 --> 09:36.184
- Yeah, well, him.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.968
I saw him--

09:38.012 --> 09:39.622
- I need to see Colton.

09:40.754 --> 09:41.668
Please.

09:41.711 --> 09:45.323
[dramatic orchestral music]

09:53.549 --> 09:54.550
- Excuse me, father?

09:57.814 --> 10:01.426
My wife, we just lost a child.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.915
- Hello, Larissa.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.526
I'm Father Lopez, the
hospital chaplain.

10:15.571 --> 10:16.616
My condolences.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.061
Do you want me to pray with you?

10:29.324 --> 10:32.632
- I want to see my son.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.506
[ominous atmospheric music]

[dramatic orchestral music]

11:03.358 --> 11:05.403
[crying]

11:08.015 --> 11:09.712
- [Father Lopez] Shall we pray?

11:09.756 --> 11:10.539
- Yeah.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.810
Thank you for trying to help.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.769
Let me get that, honey.

11:35.085 --> 11:38.698
[eerie atmospheric music]

12:37.147 --> 12:40.237
[baby crying]

[screaming]

12:43.893 --> 12:45.155
[breathing heavily]

12:45.199 --> 12:45.939
Hey, hey, are you okay?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.288
Are you okay?

12:47.331 --> 12:48.071
Are you okay, what is it?

12:48.115 --> 12:49.116
What is it?

12:49.159 --> 12:50.770
Look at me, look at me.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.032
I'm gonna get the nurse.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.820
- After such a trauma, bad
dreams are not unexpected.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.909
You're gonna go through a
whole range of emotions.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.389
It's a unique kind of grief.

13:01.432 --> 13:05.219
Many of my patients find
these antidepressants

13:05.262 --> 13:06.873
quite helpful.

13:06.916 --> 13:10.137
So, there's a
pharmacy downstairs.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.836
She'll likely feel
a bit dizzy or woozy

13:13.880 --> 13:15.577
till her body adjusts.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.839
It might take a few days.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.362
The hospital recommends
that we see each other

13:18.406 --> 13:20.016
on a weekly basis.

13:20.060 --> 13:20.887
How's that sound?

13:23.063 --> 13:24.542
- Will that bring back my baby?

13:26.893 --> 13:29.156
I died for a minute.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.375
Do you have any idea what I saw?

13:31.419 --> 13:35.118
[ominous orchestral music]

13:44.736 --> 13:45.868
- [Matt] Easy.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.174
- Whoa.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.218
- You okay?

13:48.262 --> 13:49.219
- The doctor's right.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.612
Those pills do make me woozy.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.704
- Hey, what did you see?

13:56.531 --> 13:57.401
- When?

13:57.445 --> 13:59.273
- What you said to Dr. Niedorf.

13:59.316 --> 14:02.189
What did you see
when you flat-lined?

14:03.581 --> 14:04.408
- Can't remember.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.720
That woman is so weird.

[eerie atmospheric music]

14:58.375 --> 15:02.205
[dramatic orchestral music]

15:28.928 --> 15:31.321
- Honey, Jessica's said she's
left you four voicemails.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.932
Are you not gonna call her back?

15:36.544 --> 15:38.763
[sighing]

15:41.157 --> 15:43.464
You sure you're okay with
me going to work today?

15:44.378 --> 15:45.509
- Yeah.

15:45.553 --> 15:46.641
- Okay, I just think
if we want things

15:46.684 --> 15:47.424
to get back to normal.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.512
- Normal.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.952
How are we supposed
to get back to normal?

15:55.606 --> 15:56.868
- Well--

15:56.912 --> 15:58.435

34:26.237 --> 34:28.196
- Okay, Mr. Kane, there
are many different kinds

34:28.239 --> 34:29.502
of possession--

34:29.545 --> 34:31.025
- Okay, I think it's
best if you leave.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.505
- I bless you in the name
of the father and son

34:32.547 --> 34:34.072
and the holy spirit.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.333
- Thank you.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.465
Thank you for coming.

35:03.318 --> 35:04.493
- [Ann] I must be punished.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.237
[breathing heavily]

35:28.126 --> 35:29.562
- The priest said that there
are many different types

35:29.605 --> 35:31.041
of possessions.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.609
But Larissa said she
saw some, some sort of--

35:33.653 --> 35:36.177
- Larissa has a hard
time letting go.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.179
She holds onto
stuff, you know that.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.051
She can't let go of
Colton, she has to.

35:41.095 --> 35:44.185
Look, I wanna, I wanna
help her do that.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.491
- How?

35:45.534 --> 35:47.406
- A friend of mine, he
works with the dying.

35:47.449 --> 35:48.668
He helps people crossover.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.322
- Well, Larissa's
not dying, so--

35:50.365 --> 35:52.150
- No, but she did
die, for a minute.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.803
Maybe there's something in that.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.502
- Jessica, you know how I feel
about all this woo-hoo stuff.

35:56.545 --> 35:58.634
- Hey, you reached out to me.

35:58.678 --> 35:59.940
This is how I can help.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.811
I'll be on the first
flight tomorrow morning,

36:01.855 --> 36:03.509
no need to even
pick me up, okay?

36:07.208 --> 36:08.601
[dog barking]

[dramatic piano music]

36:13.040 --> 36:13.997
Nice house.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.608
- Thanks.

36:34.931 --> 36:35.932
- My sister.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.588
- My beautiful sister.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.199
- Hi, hi.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.593
- Okay, come on.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.942
We're gonna get out of bed,

36:45.986 --> 36:47.509
you're gonna throw
away those pills.

36:47.553 --> 36:48.945
Matthew's gonna go off to work,

36:48.989 --> 36:51.948
and you and I are going
to see Pedro Salazar.

36:51.992 --> 36:52.732
- Who?

36:52.775 --> 36:53.559
- A friend.

36:54.995 --> 36:55.909
Let's go.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.127
Let's get you better.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.740
[dramatic orchestral music]

37:00.783 --> 37:02.263
Come on, I'll drive your car.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.222
- Okay.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.691
- It's all right to let go.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.172
There's nothing to fear.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.493
Nice to see you.

37:58.537 --> 37:59.320
- You too.

38:00.452 --> 38:01.975
- I'm Pedro.

38:02.018 --> 38:03.019
- Larissa.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.760
- Nice to meet you.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.241
He's at peace.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.155
Almost ready.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.115
That's not always the case.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.769
Many do not go quietly.

38:14.770 --> 38:15.902
Not even after death.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.688
When you died in the hospital,

38:19.732 --> 38:22.343
you went through the gate
that divides life and death.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.519
That's why you are so
attuned to the dead.

38:25.607 --> 38:28.131
A spirit is reaching out to you.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.350
- Colton.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.961
- No, it's still Earth-bound.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.223
Not ready to leave.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.836
Refuses to go.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.664
- But what about Colton?

38:38.707 --> 38:39.882
- He's fine.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.493
His spirit wants to go.

38:42.842 --> 38:43.886
Please.

38:50.545 --> 38:51.938
He'll always be a part of you.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.376
Let him go.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.336
Let him know it's all right.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.382
Just close your eyes,

39:02.601 --> 39:04.733
and say what you
have to say to him.

[light orchestral music]

39:41.074 --> 39:41.857
- He's gone.

39:45.905 --> 39:46.775
I can feel it.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.081
He's gone.

[ominous orchestral music]

39:57.786 --> 39:59.005
- This spirit,

40:01.007 --> 40:05.228
she is determined,
very powerful.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.666
Larissa, do not let her in.

40:07.709 --> 40:08.449
- In where?

40:08.493 --> 40:09.798
- [Pedro] Inside you.

40:09.842 --> 40:10.756
- [Jessica] Is my
sister in danger?

40:10.799 --> 40:13.062
- Not if your desire is strong.

40:13.106 --> 40:15.587
The will to live is everything.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.245
- I love you, Jess.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.945
Have a safe flight, and
a good yoga conference,

40:25.988 --> 40:29.949
and just, thank
you, for everything.

Okay, I'll call you.

- Bye, sweetie.

[eerie atmospheric music]

41:07.552 --> 41:10.685

staring at me from that window

41:10.729 --> 41:14.080
upstairs day and night and
I have had enough of it.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.385
Enough.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.300
Now, you make her
leave me alone,

41:17.344 --> 41:19.259
or I will take legal action.

I don't know if, like, rat
died under the house, or what,

46:59.381 --> 47:00.905
but it's disgusting.

47:02.210 --> 47:03.908
- This is Saratoga Springs
There are no rats here.

47:06.562 --> 47:07.912
- She broke into
the house today.

- Who?

47:09.391 --> 47:11.132
- Ann's daughter, the one
who keeps staring at me.

She was in Colton's room.

47:12.655 --> 47:13.352

Did you call the police?

I don't know, she
just, she was gone.

wheelchair broke into our house

and then made it all the way
upstairs to the baby's room--

I'm not on any meds, Matt.

48:20.810 --> 48:22.377

and we both know that
it's not possible.

Jessica took me to see Pedro.

making progress.

that I just imagined

that woman in our house?

48:33.998 --> 48:36.043
Yeah, so you think I'm crazy.

48:36.087 --> 48:37.436
- I don't know what to think.

48:37.479 --> 48:38.654
- Do you think that I
should be back on my meds?

I want my life to go
back to the way it was.

gonna be how it is--

I don't know, I don't know
if I can take much more.

48:52.364 --> 48:53.582

either of us can.

when she just left, you
know what I used to tell

53:04.268 --> 53:07.140
myself is everything's
gonna be all right.

53:07.184 --> 53:10.578
And I would say that
over and over to myself

out to be all right.

53:30.511 --> 53:31.860
- Yeah, did you
ever forgive her?

53:31.904 --> 53:32.687
- In my own way.

53:33.993 --> 53:36.082
But then I had you to
look after, didn't I?

53:37.649 --> 53:38.432
- Yeah.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.916
I don't think I'm
as strong as you.

53:45.570 --> 53:47.528
- You know, back in high
school, when you'd get

53:47.572 --> 53:50.183
knocked down or tripped up
on the basketball court,

53:50.227 --> 53:52.229
my heart would stop.

53:52.272 --> 53:55.232
But then you'd
get right back up.

53:55.275 --> 53:56.363
Keep going.

53:56.407 --> 53:58.060
You couldn't be stopped.

53:58.104 --> 54:00.149
You put yourself
through law school,

54:00.193 --> 54:01.760
you pushed and pushed.

54:01.803 --> 54:04.545
And I'm so proud of you.

54:04.589 --> 54:07.679
Matt, you're the
strongest person I know.

55:33.808 --> 55:34.983
[intense orchestral music]

55:35.027 --> 55:35.810

55:36.855 --> 55:38.378
Get out or I shoot.

[laughing]

56:25.469 --> 56:26.295
- [Matt] Larissa?

56:27.514 --> 56:28.341
Larissa?

56:30.996 --> 56:32.171
Larissa?

56:32.214 --> 56:35.783
[dramatic orchestral music]

56:42.790 --> 56:45.402
[alarm beeping]

56:55.542 --> 56:56.935
- I would've made
a terrible mother.

56:56.978 --> 56:58.545
- Don't say that.

56:58.589 --> 56:59.546
- Unfit.

56:59.590 --> 57:00.765
- [Matt] Larissa, don't.

57:00.808 --> 57:02.723
- It must be in my genes.

57:02.767 --> 57:04.595
- What do you mean?

57:04.638 --> 57:09.426
- That my dad had it, and
he saw things, heard things.

57:10.470 --> 57:12.907
And he went down to the garage,

57:12.951 --> 57:16.041
and sat in the car,

57:16.084 --> 57:18.783
let the exhaust fumes
do what they do.

57:20.001 --> 57:21.002
- You said it was
a heart attack.

57:22.700 --> 57:25.703
- That's just what
we told people.

57:25.746 --> 57:27.531
I was the one that found him.

57:28.662 --> 57:31.883
And I didn't call for my mom.

57:31.926 --> 57:33.450
I didn't call for anyone.

57:33.493 --> 57:35.843
I just sat there, for hours,

57:35.887 --> 57:39.804
just wanting with everything
in my body for him to wake up.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.938
And then my mom showed up,

57:43.982 --> 57:46.332
and just freaked out on me.

57:50.815 --> 57:54.122
Told me that I was
bad, and I was sick.

57:56.908 --> 57:58.126
Just like him.

58:01.782 --> 58:03.784
Please don't divorce me.

58:50.222 --> 58:53.051
[water running]

[intense orchestral music]

59:14.638 --> 59:15.421
You bitch.

59:16.814 --> 59:18.990
Get out, get out, get out!

59:19.033 --> 59:21.253
[gasping]

59:25.170 --> 59:29.348
She, she was in...

59:30.784 --> 59:32.569
She was right here.

59:32.612 --> 59:33.874
She was right here, I saw her.

59:33.918 --> 59:34.919
She...

59:39.924 --> 59:40.707
There.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.883
There, she's in the window.

59:42.927 --> 59:44.406
She's in the window.

59:44.450 --> 59:45.930
Tell me that you can see her.

59:45.973 --> 59:47.061
Matt, look.

59:47.105 --> 59:48.236
Tell me you see her.

59:48.280 --> 59:50.064
- I don't see anyone.

59:50.108 --> 59:51.022
I don't see anyone.

59:53.720 --> 59:55.853
[crying]

01:00:04.426 --> 01:00:06.603
- I can't do this anymore.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:10.824
I just want it to stop.

01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:12.478
I just want it to
stop happening.

01:00:12.521 --> 01:00:13.610
Make it stop.

01:00:24.403 --> 01:00:25.970
- You really wanna
help your wife?

01:00:26.013 --> 01:00:27.145
Okay, tough love.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:29.016
Commit her to a
psychiatric facility.

01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:35.544
- For how long?

01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:36.981
- As long as it takes.

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:43.161
- I don't think I can do that.

01:00:43.204 --> 01:00:45.250
I don't think I could put
her in a place like that.

01:00:45.293 --> 01:00:48.166
- Your wife is
delusional, paranoid.

01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:51.038
She's a danger to herself
and likely to you.

01:00:51.082 --> 01:00:54.781

[distant siren wailing]

01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:42.655
- Jessica.

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:48.139
[eerie atmospheric music]

Please.

01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:13.164
[knocking on door]

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:18.256
[dramatic orchestral music]

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:19.387
- [Pedro] Mr. Kane,
please come in.

01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:21.041
- Hi, thanks for seeing me.

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:22.129
- [Pedro] My pleasure.

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:26.525
Jessica is concerned.

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:27.308
- [Matt] Yeah, I know.

01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:28.570
So am I.

01:02:28.614 --> 01:02:31.748
- I warned your
wife to stay strong,

01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:33.924
to fight, to want to live.

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:36.883
In her grief, she has
lost her will, her desire,

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:39.233
yet the spirit wants
to live desperately

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:40.539
through Larissa.

01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:42.846
If it can, it will
take over her life.

01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:44.108
- So we're talking
about a possession.

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:45.587
- Worse.

01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:47.372
She will exchange
Larissa's life for her own.

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:48.199
- An exchange.

01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:55.162
- The spirit senses that Larissa

01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:57.512
no longer values her own life.

01:02:57.556 --> 01:02:59.253
That makes her vulnerable.

01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:02.343
Her life, a good life,
is there for the taking.

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:04.128
When Larissa came to see me,

01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:06.434
I felt its rage surrounding her.

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:07.392
- Rage.

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:09.698
- At it's own imperfect life.

01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:13.267
And at Larissa, for
giving up on hers.

01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:16.096
If this spirit succeeds, the
only way to save your wife

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.315
is by killing her.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:19.491
- I'm sorry, you want
me to kill my wife?

01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:20.231
- No no, not that way.

01:03:20.274 --> 01:03:21.275
Please.

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.450
- What do you mean?

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:23.364
. She must be brought
back to the gate

01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:24.626
that separates life from death.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:25.976
And she must choose life.

01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:27.760
You're afraid, I know,
but you love Larissa,

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.849
and you want to save her.

01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.242
So you must do this.

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.200
The longer the spirit
inhabits Larissa's life,

01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:35.159
the harder it will
be to bring her back.

01:03:35.202 --> 01:03:36.421
- Can I see this spirit?

01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:38.858
- If a spirit has
recently left its body,

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.381
then some of us can see it.

01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:41.948
The longer a body is dead,

01:03:41.992 --> 01:03:43.515
the less likely we
can see its spirit.

01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:45.125
- Okay, I'm gonna
take that as a no.

01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:46.039
But she can see it.

01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.780
- She's passed through the gate.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.261
So she can see spirits
clearly as you and I can

01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:51.175
see each other.

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.698
You will see the spirit only

01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:54.700
when it's ready to
take Larissa's place,

01:03:54.743 --> 01:03:56.006
or already has.

01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:57.137
- This sounds--

01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:58.182
- I know, I know.

01:03:58.225 --> 01:03:59.313
Impossible.

01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:00.488
You must get Larissa
to choose life,

01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:02.142
or you will lose her
forever, Mr. Kane.

01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.317
Please.

[intense orchestral music]

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:06.059

01:04:09.454 --> 01:04:10.237
Honey?

01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:13.675
Larissa.

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:19.072
Oh, God.

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:20.769
Hey, hey.

01:04:20.813 --> 01:04:21.858
Hey, can you hear me?

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.122
Okay.

01:04:25.165 --> 01:04:26.036
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

01:04:29.517 --> 01:04:30.301

01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:39.179
There you go.

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:41.007
We're gonna do that again.

01:04:48.101 --> 01:04:49.798
Here, have another sip.

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:05.640
- She's watching.

01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:07.555
- There's nobody there.

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:08.513
- There is.

01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:10.645
- I'm gonna go next door.

01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:12.212
I'm gonna go to that window.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.606
I'm gonna show you that
there's nobody there, okay?

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:16.434
- To show me I'm
just like my dad.

01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:18.827
- Honey, I just wanna
help you get better.

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:21.395
Stay right here, look
for me over there.

Do you need help?

01:06:32.031 --> 01:06:33.293
Is anyone home?

- Yes, hi.

01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:52.590
I found a body.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.551
I'm at 999 Oak Drive.

- [Clifford] Matt, what's up?

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:06.473
- I just, dad, I think
you should come over.

01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:08.606
Honey, I saw her.

01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:10.260
I saw her.

Sweetheart, I just found her
corpse in her bedroom, okay?

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:15.134

Okay look, I'll be back soon.

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:22.272
Get some rest.

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:23.663
I gotta go talk to them.

[eerie atmospheric music]

01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:41.856
- Isabelle Pelway, 24.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:44.903
According to records,
born paralyzed and mute.

01:08:44.946 --> 01:08:47.600
Appears she was killed
by asphyxiation.

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:50.082
Coroner figures
about two weeks ago.

01:08:50.952 --> 01:08:52.040
- We moved in two weeks ago.

01:08:52.084 --> 01:08:53.520
It's crazy.

01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:56.131
- So what were you
doing in here tonight?

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:59.483
- I wanted to talk
to Ann, Mrs. Pelway.

01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:01.224
- About what?

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.573
- Just neighborhood stuff.

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:06.620
- Mr. Kane, what did you
wanna talk to her about?

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:08.709
- I wanted to talk
to her about my wife.

01:09:08.752 --> 01:09:10.058
Okay?

01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:11.886
- And when was the last
time you saw Ann Pelway?

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.801
- I think a couple days
ago when she was snooping.

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:15.151
- Snooping?

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:16.456
- Yeah, she looks at
us from her window.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.892
She does it a lot, it
really scares my wife.

01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.850
So I was coming over
to talk to Mrs. Pelway,

01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:21.026
and ask her to stop.

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.508
- Okay, well we're
looking for Miss Pelway,

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:28.033
so if you see her, you
just give me a call.

01:09:28.076 --> 01:09:29.252
- [Matt] Okay.

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:33.560
- Be okay, you got this.

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.258
- Yeah.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:37.520
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:09:37.564 --> 01:09:40.611

[dramatic orchestral music]

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.683
Mmm.

01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:13.209
Hmm.

01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:16.908
You know what I think?

01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:22.000
I think now that the body's
been found, it's over.

01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:22.827
She's at peace.

01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:32.140
It's really over, Larissa.

01:10:34.752 --> 01:10:37.581
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:11:09.395 --> 01:11:12.355
[muffled screaming]

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.326
- [Ann] Isabelle, I thought
I could set you free.

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.763
I thought I was helping you.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.591
I was wrong.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.029
I was abandoning you
like your father.

01:11:35.073 --> 01:11:36.335
- [Matt] It's over.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.205
Come back to bed.

01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:39.207
- [Ann] I'm sorry.

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:45.301
I wanted so much more for you.

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:47.781
I kept praying for you to come.

01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:08.585
[eerie atmospheric music]

01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:12.893
- The mother's back.

01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:14.242
Oh my God!

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:15.679
We gotta, get down,
get down, get down.

01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:17.768
Don't let her see you.

01:12:27.778 --> 01:12:29.432
[phone ringing]

01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:30.737
- Smith.

01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:31.999
- Detective Smith,
it's Matt Kane.

01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:34.045
The woman, the mother,
Ann Pelway, she's back.

01:12:34.088 --> 01:12:35.699
She's right next
door at the house.

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:37.048
- That's impossible.

01:12:37.091 --> 01:12:38.266
- No, I'm looking
at her right now.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:41.531
- Mr. Kane, I am looking
at her right now.

01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:43.881
Ann Pelway killed
herself in her car

01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:46.187
at some spot by the river.

01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:49.713
[ominous orchestral music]

01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:55.675
Mr. Kane?

01:12:57.198 --> 01:12:57.982
Mr. Kane?

01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:00.463
Are you...

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:01.333
Mr. Kane?

01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:03.466
[sighing]

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:05.859
Send some officers by her house.

01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:14.128
- I'm here to set you free.

01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:17.218
To always be with you.

01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:21.005
That's why I did this.

01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:24.748
[muffled screaming]

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:26.532
Oh God.

01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:27.925
Oh, forgive me.

[gasping]

01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:42.766
- I want you, all mine.

01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:46.073
- I want my wife back.

01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.338
- [Isabelle] Too late.

01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:52.602
[screaming]

01:13:52.645 --> 01:13:54.125
You can't save her.

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.823
You belong to me.

01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:57.868
You're mine.

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:04.918
[glass smashing]

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:05.919

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:15.668
I'm here, Larissa.

01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:16.756
I love you.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.237
[screaming]

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:23.023
- Stop this.

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:26.462
Isabel, stop.

01:14:29.856 --> 01:14:30.857
Choose life.

01:14:33.338 --> 01:14:36.384
[shrieking]

01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:37.647
I can take you to the gate,

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:39.344
but you have to
want to come back.

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:41.389
Choose us.

01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:42.782
Come back to me,
sweetie, please.

01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:43.827
I love you.

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.524
Choose life, choose us.

01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:48.092
Larissa, Larissa, choose life.

[gasping]

01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:55.969

[machines beeping]

01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:23.562
- Eclampsia.

01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:26.086
She spent a full
minute clinically dead.

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:31.135
You need to know there may
be some residual effects.

01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:32.919
- What about the baby?

01:15:32.963 --> 01:15:34.268
- You have a healthy son.

Welcome to the world,
Colton Francis Kane.

Got it, careful.

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:04.908

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.065
- [Larissa] What?

01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:37.070
- [Matt] What did you
see when you were dead?

01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:39.420
- [Larissa] I can't remember.
