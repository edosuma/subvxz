00:20.830 --> 00:22.790
Okay, get into character.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.370
[Toby grunts]

00:25.630 --> 00:27.760
-[both] Huh?
-Ah, guard person.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.720
Just returning to pick up
a few things and such.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.350
Uh, carry on!

00:35.050 --> 00:36.340
Awesome-sauce!

00:37.510 --> 00:40.340
I mean, splendid and whatnot.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.850
What is the meaning of this?

00:42.930 --> 00:44.350
[both gasp]

00:44.440 --> 00:45.820
[Vendel] An impostor!

00:46.400 --> 00:48.070
Guards, seize him!

00:48.150 --> 00:50.320
No, dudes, seize him!

00:50.400 --> 00:53.940
If I'm not the real Vendel,
how come I have the, uh, staff thingy?

00:54.900 --> 00:55.730
[both growl]

00:57.280 --> 01:00.320
Ahh! Unhand me at once! [groans]

01:33.400 --> 01:36.020
[Blinky] Dealing business
with these vile agents...

01:36.700 --> 01:39.120
I dearly hope we are doing
the right thing.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.040
Anything to get Aaarrrgghh!!! back.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.210
Brace yourselves.
Looks like the creep patrol is here.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.880
Follow my lead. I've seen enough
spy flicks to know how a handoff works.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.630
It's a precise ritual of nuance and power.

01:55.260 --> 01:56.260
[gasps]

01:57.220 --> 01:59.390
Not another step, wiener schnitzel!

01:59.970 --> 02:01.390
That's far enough!

02:02.100 --> 02:04.560
Now, throw us the antidote,
and we'll throw you the staff!

02:04.640 --> 02:06.970
-Are you serious?
-[Toby] Deadly!

02:07.060 --> 02:08.060
[sighs]

02:11.230 --> 02:12.350
[grunts]

02:13.230 --> 02:15.770
[grunting]

02:16.950 --> 02:18.790
Now what, Agent Toby?

02:18.860 --> 02:21.110
Um, okay, fine!

02:21.200 --> 02:23.460
Let's meet in the middle,
but no funny business!

02:23.530 --> 02:25.740
-Hands where I can see 'em!
-[sighs]

02:28.040 --> 02:31.260
Enough theatrics. Do the exchange now!

02:31.920 --> 02:33.550
[grunting]

02:33.630 --> 02:35.800
Would you let go?

02:36.800 --> 02:37.850
Yes.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.050
This will do quite nicely.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.640
"Twig of Worm's Root, ounce of silver..."

02:44.720 --> 02:46.890
This isn't an antidote!
It's a shopping list!

02:46.980 --> 02:49.860
It is the ingredients to the antidote.

02:49.940 --> 02:54.990
Boil these in oil until it burns,
and that will bring your friend back.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.280
-Pleasure doing business with you.
-[door handle clicks]

02:57.360 --> 02:59.070
[laughing]

02:59.150 --> 03:01.320
Fragwa, open the door. [sighs]

03:02.490 --> 03:05.610
Auf Wiedersehen! [laughs]

03:08.160 --> 03:09.450
[tires screeching]

03:09.540 --> 03:11.250
We did the right thing. Right, guys?

03:11.330 --> 03:13.250
Desperate times, desperate measures.

03:13.330 --> 03:16.210
Now, we must concern ourselves
with some shopping. Hmm...

03:16.750 --> 03:21.840
Where might we find the tears
of one untouched by love's first kiss?

03:22.970 --> 03:24.230
Hmm...

03:24.300 --> 03:26.590
What? I've been kissed. Many times.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.050
Your nana doesn't count.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.520
Oh.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.390
[grunts]

03:34.230 --> 03:35.480
[Gumm-Gumm snarls]

03:36.270 --> 03:38.350
Oh, yeah? Same to you, buddy.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.900
[Nomura] You seem chipper for someone
that's been fighting to the death.

03:42.990 --> 03:48.170
We just gotta hold out a little longer.
Give my friends some time to find us.

03:48.240 --> 03:53.120
Then we'll be back home
with a soft bed, deep-dish pizza...

03:53.210 --> 03:54.420
[sniffs]

03:54.500 --> 03:56.370
[coughs] Soap...

03:56.460 --> 03:58.790
[chuckles]
Man, did I take soap for granted.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.540
-"We"?
-Yeah, you're coming with me.

04:02.550 --> 04:04.380
You saved my life.

04:04.470 --> 04:07.020
The least I can do is save yours.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.440
You found some candy. How sweet.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.230
Doesn't mean your friends can save you.

04:13.310 --> 04:16.890
No one escapes the Darklands.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.149
Who knows? Weirder things have happened.

04:20.230 --> 04:22.900
[whistling eerie melody]

04:25.740 --> 04:29.530
Do you even know what you're whistling?

04:29.620 --> 04:31.080
I just thought it was catchy.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.620
-What is it?
-It's Peer Gynt.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.050
-"Peer" what?
-"Gynt."

04:35.120 --> 04:37.790
It's an aria, like an opera.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.760
-Never mind. You wouldn't understand.
-Hey, come on, try me.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.010
I mean, it's not like
we're going anywhere.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.800
[Nomura sighs]

04:45.890 --> 04:48.680
I was just a young changeling
when I first heard it...

04:49.350 --> 04:52.060
alone in your human world.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.930
But there, opening night,

04:56.020 --> 05:02.150
when the curtain rose
and the orchestra swelled...

05:02.240 --> 05:08.960
Peer Gynt is a little boy,
who stumbles into a mountain of trolls.

05:09.030 --> 05:12.160
He faces a troll king, who tells him,

05:12.250 --> 05:15.380
"To thyself be true...

05:15.460 --> 05:18.460
 and who cares what the world thinks?"

05:18.540 --> 05:21.500
But it's just a play.

05:21.590 --> 05:24.890
You want to hope, kid? Go ahead.

05:26.010 --> 05:29.060
We'll need our strength for tomorrow.

05:29.140 --> 05:33.230
-[sighs]
-Rest up, little Gynt.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.730
[whistling "In the Hall
of the Mountain King"]

05:46.150 --> 05:48.780
-[liquid boiling]
-Ugh, slimy.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.250
Slimy, gross. [retches]

05:51.080 --> 05:52.080
Mm...

05:52.740 --> 05:54.120
[sniffs] Blech!

05:54.200 --> 05:56.200
-[mouse squeaking]
-Gross! I'm gonna wash my hands.

05:58.210 --> 05:59.210
[Toby grunts]

05:59.960 --> 06:01.470
I think that's almost all of it.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.210
[grunting]

06:04.300 --> 06:05.340
[groans]

06:05.420 --> 06:06.420
[screams]

06:06.510 --> 06:07.720
Oh, that hurt. [grunts]

06:12.810 --> 06:16.900
And lastly, a fragment of Heartstone.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.720
[Claire] It's working!

06:24.440 --> 06:26.690
[scoffs] I don't get it. What happened?

06:26.780 --> 06:29.120
Nothing. It... It didn't work.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.250
-I... I thought for certain...
-No!

06:31.320 --> 06:33.110
No, come on, we did everything right!

06:33.200 --> 06:35.660
Come on, after all that we did,
it has to work.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.170
-Unless...
-[Toby] It has to.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.760
The list was bogus!
How could we have been so stupid?

06:40.830 --> 06:44.000
[sniffles] The amulet told us
we could bring him back.

06:44.670 --> 06:48.670
He has to come back. [sniffles]
I even did the tear thing.

06:49.260 --> 06:52.640
[sobbing]

06:56.310 --> 06:58.810
-[laughs]
-[grunts]

06:58.890 --> 07:01.810
-Aaarrrgghh!!!...
-Deya's grace be upon us.

07:01.900 --> 07:02.900
[growls]

07:02.980 --> 07:03.980
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunting]

07:04.070 --> 07:05.490
[screams]

07:06.400 --> 07:08.650
[Draal] You are making too much-- [grunts]

07:08.740 --> 07:10.330
-Aaarrrgghh!!!, calm yourself!
-Aaarrrgghh!!!

07:10.400 --> 07:13.070
-[grunting]
-Stop! Wait! Aaarrrgghh!!!

07:13.160 --> 07:14.000
[growling]

07:14.080 --> 07:17.710
He's disoriented! Quiet him
before he alerts all of Trollmarket!

07:17.790 --> 07:18.630
[roars]

07:21.370 --> 07:23.870
-[Toby] Whoa, Aaarrrgghh!!! Easy, easy!
-[growling]

07:23.960 --> 07:25.500
It's me, your wingman!

07:25.590 --> 07:27.390
[grunts]

07:28.090 --> 07:30.050
[roars]

07:30.130 --> 07:32.760
[panting]

07:35.510 --> 07:38.720
Wingman.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.690
Ah! He's back!

07:42.350 --> 07:45.940
-Oh, I knew he'd be back!
-[laughs] I see it, I don't believe it.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.100
[Claire laughing]

07:47.190 --> 07:49.270
We missed you, you big brute!

07:49.360 --> 07:53.730
I had all but assumed
I would never see you again, old friend.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.210
How did I...?

07:56.700 --> 07:57.910
Where's Jim?

07:58.740 --> 08:03.200
He, uh, went to the Darklands
so that no one else would get hurt.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.120
Mm. [growls]

08:05.210 --> 08:08.380
-Must get Jim!
-Oh, yes, so you do know how to save him.

08:08.460 --> 08:11.590
The amulet proclaimed
that you are the key to the hunter.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.500
So, tell us, what must we do?

08:14.050 --> 08:15.090
Um...

08:16.350 --> 08:17.440
[Kanjigar] Aarghaumont.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.180
What is...?

08:21.270 --> 08:24.980
The amulet and the Fates that guide it
have called to you.

08:25.060 --> 08:28.640
To what purpose, only you can discover,
my dear old friend.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
Uh?

08:35.070 --> 08:37.110
Hello?

08:37.990 --> 08:43.620
You are the first outsider
since time began to see our sacred realm.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.960
-[gasps]
-Welcome, Aarghaumont,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.210
to the void between worlds.

08:48.290 --> 08:50.750
Kanjigar, why?

08:50.840 --> 08:53.720
I know you have many questions.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.600
There is a reason you were chosen.

08:56.390 --> 08:59.310
There is a reason we need you.

09:06.350 --> 09:07.850
Aaarrrgghh!!!, what did you see?

09:08.440 --> 09:10.450
-Did you meet the spooky troll ghosts?
-[both gasp]

09:10.520 --> 09:12.810
[Kanjigar's voice] He did convene with us.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.940
But I am not Aarghaumont.

09:16.610 --> 09:18.740
Kanjigar the Courageous.

09:18.820 --> 09:21.660
-Wait! What?
-At ease, Blinkous.

09:21.740 --> 09:24.490
Yes, it is I.

09:24.580 --> 09:27.290
It is you... Father.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.920
-Well met.
-[grunts]

09:30.000 --> 09:31.330
My son.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.250
[sighs]

09:33.840 --> 09:37.060
But how? What has happened
to Aaarrrgghh!!!?

09:37.130 --> 09:39.260
-Your friend is here with me.
-[gasps]

09:39.890 --> 09:42.600
Aaarrrgghh!!! walked the line
between life and death,

09:42.680 --> 09:46.810
so he alone could become a vessel
for me to aid you.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey there, troll-tergeist!

09:49.230 --> 09:50.940
Give me my wingman back!

09:51.020 --> 09:56.770
At ease, Tobias Domzalski.
I will only stay until my work is done.

09:56.860 --> 10:00.780
But excuse me,
Lord Sir Kanjig-Aaarrrgghh!!!...

10:00.870 --> 10:03.040
What exactly are you here to do?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.250
I thought you knew.

10:04.330 --> 10:08.340
Only a Trollhunter can open
the Killahead Bridge.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.710
[gate rumbling]

10:09.790 --> 10:11.410
There they are!

10:11.500 --> 10:13.750
I knew it! Detain them!

10:13.840 --> 10:15.390
-Find the staff!
-[trolls grunting]

10:16.630 --> 10:18.210
[grunts]

10:18.300 --> 10:21.880
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

10:22.850 --> 10:26.690
Aaarrrgghh!!!? What dark powers
have you meddled with?

10:27.270 --> 10:29.570
-[grunting]
-[gasps]

10:30.560 --> 10:32.940
[Toby whimpering]

10:33.020 --> 10:34.400
-[grunts]
-Toby!

10:34.480 --> 10:37.480
-[grunting]
-[trolls grunting, screaming]

10:37.570 --> 10:39.690
-No! [shrieks]
-[gasps]

10:39.780 --> 10:41.490
-[Toby screaming]
-[grunts]

10:41.570 --> 10:43.650
[screaming]

10:44.370 --> 10:45.500
[grunts]

10:45.580 --> 10:48.040
We have little time.
This will take us to Bone's Alley.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.790
-But, Father--
-Follow me, son.

10:49.870 --> 10:52.040
We are together at last.

10:53.540 --> 10:56.380
-[yawns]
-Huh?

10:57.800 --> 11:00.470
-[footsteps approaching]
-[guard growls]

11:00.550 --> 11:01.710
[guard groans]

11:04.600 --> 11:07.520
Kanjigar's creeping spider!
A signature move!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.510
This guy's a legend.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.970
[grunting]

11:11.060 --> 11:11.890
[Kanjigar] Hurry!

11:12.520 --> 11:15.690
Claire Nuñez, I require
a portal to Killahead Bridge.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.360
Quickly.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.020
[gasps, chuckles]

11:19.110 --> 11:21.940
-[gasps, chatters angrily]
-Killahead.

11:23.530 --> 11:24.780
[chatters, yells]

11:25.450 --> 11:27.490
-Quick, everyone through!
-[Claire grunts]

11:28.450 --> 11:29.910
[Claire] Fudgeknuckle!

11:30.920 --> 11:31.750
[gasps]

11:31.830 --> 11:33.080
[troll grunting]

11:33.170 --> 11:34.470
We'll take the gyre.

11:34.540 --> 11:36.920
[troll groaning]

11:37.000 --> 11:40.420
Kanjigar, why don't you simply talk
with Vendel and the Tribunal?

11:40.510 --> 11:43.350
Surely, one of Trollmarket's
greatest champions could persuade--

11:43.430 --> 11:47.060
Talking requires time, Blinkous,
something we do not have.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.050
Things are dire.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.310
If we do not act now,
James Lake, Jr. will die.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
-[both gasp]
-Uh...

12:01.530 --> 12:05.040
But Killahead's in the woods.
There's no gyre station there.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.620
We don't need one.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.490
[Blinky screaming]

12:12.870 --> 12:16.830
[chattering angrily]

12:16.920 --> 12:18.470
-[ground rumbling]
-[Chompsky screams]

12:18.550 --> 12:19.800
[all screaming]

12:21.630 --> 12:24.880
[coughing, chattering]

12:26.350 --> 12:31.230
Oh, dear. We are officially fugitives
from Trollmarket.

12:31.310 --> 12:34.610
Forget what they think.
We must concentrate on what we do.

12:34.690 --> 12:37.610
-We have all that we need.
-And then some.

12:37.690 --> 12:41.150
Okay, how does this crazy crime spree
help us save Jimbo, exactly?

12:41.240 --> 12:45.080
Friends, I have seen the impossible.

12:45.160 --> 12:49.120
A vision of you saving James Lake, Jr.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.620
But, to do so, you must follow
the path I lay before you.

12:53.710 --> 12:56.260
We've done the impossible before.
We can handle it.

12:56.330 --> 12:59.920
I have my war hammer!
It's hungry to smash.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.420
[Kanjigar] No, no weapons.

13:02.130 --> 13:04.000
In my plan, you will need nothing else

13:04.090 --> 13:06.960
but the knowledge and tools
I will give you.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.220
Aw, man!

13:08.300 --> 13:10.630
What possible chance do we stand
if we are unarmed?

13:10.720 --> 13:14.180
Each of you will be charged with a task.

13:14.270 --> 13:18.570
You must follow them to the letter
if there is any hope of survival.

13:18.650 --> 13:21.070
Claire Nuñez, take this.

13:21.150 --> 13:24.650
In the Darklands,
it will aid you in a key moment.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.580
Um... thank you?

13:26.660 --> 13:28.750
Blinkous, take this flare crystal.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.570
Its blinding light will save your life.

13:31.660 --> 13:35.330
My life? Could I get some specificity
on that statement?

13:35.410 --> 13:37.450
-Tobias Domzalski.
-Ooh, ooh, me, me, me!

13:37.540 --> 13:39.500
What do I get? What do I get? [gasps]

13:39.590 --> 13:44.390
You must ensure that your team
only brings back James Lake, Jr.

13:44.880 --> 13:49.050
-No one else.
-Okay, got it. Just Jim.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.100
Guess I got good advice.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.260
Father, what is my task?

13:53.350 --> 13:58.400
I know you wish to go into battle,
but I need you here.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.990
-I can help.
-And you shall.

14:01.570 --> 14:05.570
Of all of you,
your responsibility is greatest.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.910
You keep watch
so that Gunmar does not escape.

14:09.990 --> 14:14.490
If your friends do not come back,
you must make a choice.

14:14.580 --> 14:17.920
-To destroy the bridge?
-If you must.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.630
I understand.

14:21.170 --> 14:23.970
Now, then, you all have your orders!

14:24.050 --> 14:26.720
Wait! This is all happening so fast.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.760
We don't even know our way
around the Darklands.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.010
-But your gnome, who survived it, does.
-[Chompsky] Huh?

14:32.100 --> 14:34.600
-He will be a guide... and more.
-[gasps, chatters]

14:34.680 --> 14:39.350
Jim's time is short.
I sense Gunmar readying to destroy him.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.360
Wait, you're saying,
as you were fighting,

14:44.440 --> 14:46.900
your mother was in the other room?

14:46.990 --> 14:50.830
Yeah! And then, Strickler transforms,

14:50.910 --> 14:51.750
and he goes,

14:51.820 --> 14:54.240
[imitating Strickler]
"Good look for Picture Day?"

14:54.330 --> 14:55.500
I mean, come on!

14:55.580 --> 14:57.710
-He always was a to--
-[footsteps approaching]

14:58.790 --> 15:00.840
Enough rest, impure.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.510
Gunmar has something special
in mind for you.

15:04.590 --> 15:07.760
Chompsky, I promise,
if you find Jim, I'll buy you

15:07.840 --> 15:09.710
-the Sally-Go-Back moon base.
-[groans]

15:09.800 --> 15:12.210
So, everybody pitch in.
Those things are pricey.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.100
[chattering nervously]

15:31.610 --> 15:33.530
What is the plan, Kanjigar?

15:33.620 --> 15:36.620
I have naught but a flare
and more questions than answers.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.870
I cannot reveal more,

15:37.950 --> 15:41.790
for to know your future
is to risk dooming it.

15:41.870 --> 15:46.790
Trust in yourselves and me,
and all will be clear soon enough.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.180
-Um...
-Don't worry!

15:48.260 --> 15:50.760
With super Trollhunter
Kanjig-Aaarrrgghh!!! by our side,

15:50.840 --> 15:52.590
two for one, boom!

15:52.680 --> 15:54.140
We can't lose!

15:54.220 --> 15:57.190
I'm afraid I will not be joining you
into the Darklands.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.590
[both gasp]

15:58.680 --> 16:02.970
After I open the bridge, I must use
the last of my power here to keep it open.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.680
Wait, you're leaving?

16:04.770 --> 16:08.440
You will need Aaarrrgghh!!!, not I.
He will make his own way.

16:08.530 --> 16:10.870
Oh, dear.
Is that another one of your riddles?

16:10.940 --> 16:13.400
One revolution of the amulet's arm

16:13.490 --> 16:17.540
is all the time I can grant you
before the bridge closes!

16:17.620 --> 16:20.210
Best of luck, Trollhunters!

16:31.720 --> 16:33.060
[sighs]

16:34.890 --> 16:36.640
Save Jim.

16:36.720 --> 16:41.760
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]
-Remember what you must do, my son!

16:45.270 --> 16:47.680
[ticking]

16:47.770 --> 16:51.270
This whole thing is nuts.
Are we really doing this?

16:51.360 --> 16:52.610
Uh, I think we are,

16:52.690 --> 16:54.820
but I was half-listening,
he was talking really fast.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.660
I don't know
what we're supposed to be doing!

16:56.740 --> 17:00.700
Worry not! We'll get through this
as we always do, together.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.880
[amulet ticking]

17:02.960 --> 17:06.000
Draal, we'll be back soon.
Keep the door open, will ya?

17:06.079 --> 17:07.329
For Jim!

17:07.420 --> 17:08.589
[all] For Jim!

17:08.670 --> 17:10.589
[all screaming]

17:11.920 --> 17:12.750
[gasps]

17:12.839 --> 17:16.170
Bring back our Trollhunter, my friends.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.089
-[Claire grunts]
-Oh, dear.

17:22.020 --> 17:24.270
Such is the stuff of nightmares.

17:24.349 --> 17:26.270
[creature snarling]

17:26.349 --> 17:29.560
Uh, let's not stay one minute longer
than we need to, huh?

17:29.650 --> 17:31.660
Chompsky, do you know
where they're keeping Jim?

17:31.730 --> 17:33.060
[chattering]

17:36.280 --> 17:38.030
[Blinky] Perhaps I'm meant
to use the flare.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.120
[Claire] Kanjigar said
you use it to save your life.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.410
I don't think that's right now.

17:42.490 --> 17:45.620
Why do the Darklands have to be
so dark, man? I can't see a thing.

17:45.710 --> 17:47.550
[screams, grunts]

17:47.620 --> 17:50.540
How am I to discern
when my life depends on it?

17:50.630 --> 17:53.970
Such infernal instructions.
They're both cryptic and oblique.

17:54.050 --> 17:56.810
What if my indecisiveness
is cause for our undoing? [grunts]

17:56.880 --> 18:00.010
-Oh, ahh! Cragglesnacks!
-Really?

18:00.100 --> 18:02.690
I know. You would think
four hands would be more helpful.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.100
Oh, but alas, my accursed butter digits!

18:05.180 --> 18:09.560
Blinky, you needed that!
You're going to die without it!

18:09.650 --> 18:12.070
I'm aware of that!

18:12.150 --> 18:15.320
Okay, no one panic. Don't panic.
Everyone, stop panicking!

18:15.400 --> 18:16.940
[panting]

18:17.030 --> 18:21.410
Your rope! Yes, we can retrieve it.
Kanjigar thought of everything.

18:22.870 --> 18:25.880
-But Jim is running out of time.
-Yes, you three go ahead.

18:25.950 --> 18:29.410
Aaarrrgghh!!! will help me retrieve
the flare. We'll be right behind.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.670
[Claire] Hang on, Jim.
We're coming for you.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.370
[Toby] I'm so afraid!

18:33.460 --> 18:36.630
[Claire] Don't worry, Tobes.
You have a girl to protect you.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.890
Ugh, it's like an Escher painting
threw up in here.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.890
-[chatters]
-[Toby panting]

18:46.850 --> 18:48.390
[gasps] Are those Gumm-Gumms?

18:49.230 --> 18:53.400
And goblins? [whimpering, panting]

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
Oh, thank you.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.530
-Chompsky?
-[chattering happily]

19:03.620 --> 19:06.290
How? How did you get here?
How did you find me?

19:06.370 --> 19:09.580
-[Toby, Claire speaking indistinctly]
-Toby? Claire?

19:09.670 --> 19:12.050
-Up here! I'm up in here!
-[Chompsky chattering]

19:12.130 --> 19:13.670
[Toby] Jimbo? Oh, my gosh!

19:14.420 --> 19:17.340
Oh, my gosh, Jimbo!
You're not dead! You're not dead!

19:17.420 --> 19:19.090
It's you! It's you, Tobes!

19:19.170 --> 19:21.130
-It's really you!
-Jimbo, I'm so glad you're okay!

19:21.220 --> 19:22.980
You are okay, right?
Are you? Are you okay?

19:23.050 --> 19:25.180
-You okay?
-Tobes, I'm-- I'm fine.

19:25.260 --> 19:28.100
I've been better, yeah,
but I'm keeping it crispy!

19:28.180 --> 19:29.180
I got your message!

19:29.270 --> 19:31.900
Keep it crispy! [chuckles]
I told you he'd get it, Claire.

19:32.850 --> 19:35.690
-Claire.
-Hey... you.

19:35.770 --> 19:36.770
Hey.

19:37.690 --> 19:40.770
-I... I can't believe you guys made it.
-[laughs]

19:40.860 --> 19:43.030
-Wouldn't have missed it for the world.
-How did you--?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.250
Oh, it's a long story.
But I'm glad you asked.

19:45.330 --> 19:47.710
First, we had to get the bridge
from the bottom of the ocean.

19:47.790 --> 19:51.880
And we brought Aaarrrgghh!!! back to life,
and he merged with Ghost Kanjigar!

19:51.960 --> 19:53.800
Wait, what? Aaarrrgghh!!!'s alive?

19:53.880 --> 19:56.760
[Claire] Probably should catch you
up later. We gotta get you outta here.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.470
Okay, Tobes, hurry up and use
your war hammer to bust me outta here.

19:59.550 --> 20:02.060
But, um... But we don't have our weapons.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.420
Wait a minute.

20:04.510 --> 20:07.470
Kanjigar said I needed this thing
for a key moment.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.940
This is a key!

20:10.180 --> 20:12.260
[grunting] I...

20:13.520 --> 20:14.930
-[Gumm-Gumm snarling]
-[shrieks]

20:15.020 --> 20:16.350
Come on, come on, come on!

20:16.440 --> 20:18.980
-[both grunting]
-[chattering]

20:19.070 --> 20:21.280
[Toby] Hurry, hurry, hurry!
They're coming for him, guys!

20:21.360 --> 20:23.070
-Gotta get outta here!
-I'm not leaving you!

20:23.160 --> 20:24.290
Come on, we gotta hide!

20:28.740 --> 20:31.780
Your time has come at last, fleshbag.

20:32.870 --> 20:36.960
Uh, guys, I don't know.
My stomach is feeling kinda off.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.750
You think maybe
you could come back and--

20:38.840 --> 20:40.300
[Jim groans, coughs]

20:40.380 --> 20:42.960
How does your stomach feel now?

20:43.800 --> 20:46.880
No! Let go of me! Wait! Stop!

20:50.140 --> 20:51.300
[chattering]

20:52.350 --> 20:53.810
-[whimpering]
-Ow!

20:56.860 --> 20:57.990
[whispering]

20:58.730 --> 21:02.440
Take the hunter to the Crucible.
I will be there shortly.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.120
[Jim grunting]

21:07.320 --> 21:12.160
Kanjigar gives me one item
of utmost importance, and I drop it.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.130
Blinkous, you imbecile!

21:15.620 --> 21:18.160
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Your flare?
-Oh, dear.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.920
[both gasp]

21:24.260 --> 21:25.100
Oh, dear.

21:25.180 --> 21:26.720
[grunts]

21:26.800 --> 21:29.300
[groaning]

21:29.390 --> 21:34.360
If beasts won't break you,
perhaps your friend will.

21:35.270 --> 21:36.980
Are you kidding me?

21:37.060 --> 21:39.890
-We're locked in? We're the rescue party!
-Wha--?

21:39.980 --> 21:42.520
Those instructions were pretty vague!

21:43.110 --> 21:44.190
[Dictatious] You were always

21:44.280 --> 21:45.910
-the fool, Blinkous.
-What?

21:45.990 --> 21:47.870
-[Dictatious laughing]
-No! Impossible!

21:48.530 --> 21:52.990
-You were dead!
-Am I? [laughing]

21:53.080 --> 21:53.960
Dictatious.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.880
We never could agree on anything, brother.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.960
[Gunmar] Know thyself...

22:03.050 --> 22:05.970
 and know thy enemy.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.720
-[Gunmar laughs]
-Not you, no.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.380
A battle to the death!
