Now for the question that I'm
famous for asking on Fridays...

00:06.963 --> 00:08.747
What's everyone
doing this weekend?

00:08.791 --> 00:11.141
Me and Dick are gonna go
check out this cranberry bog

00:11.185 --> 00:12.925
down in the Chimdale Wetlands.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.579
How about you, Deputy Director?

00:14.623 --> 00:17.756
Oh, I'm going to
a different cranberry bog.

Back to work.

00:24.676 --> 00:27.940
We're in the middle
of a giant mission!

00:27.984 --> 00:30.334
Do you have any plans
this weekend, Stan?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.119
Hey, would you mind
asking the other guys?

00:32.162 --> 00:33.511
I feel like if I answer,

00:33.555 --> 00:35.513
I'll get trapped
in a conversation with you.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.167
But you're the only one
with a family,

00:37.211 --> 00:39.300
and families have always
fascinated me

00:39.343 --> 00:41.824
because I don't have one.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.479
That's a stupid reason
to be fascinated by something.

00:44.522 --> 00:47.438
I don't have a vagina
and I never think about those.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.614
Well, now I'm thinking
about them a little bit.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.008
Thanks a lot, Weitzman.
Now I have to go home at lunch.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.488
Hey, wait!

00:53.531 --> 00:55.533
I have a coupon to take
a whole family to a buffet.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.796

Thanks, Dr. Weitzman!

00:57.840 --> 00:59.059
Maybe I could join you guys.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.712
Oh, I couldn't ask you
to do that.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.279
After all,
you gave us the coupon.

01:02.323 --> 01:03.976

01:07.937 --> 01:09.373

a lot of chitchat

decorating the car.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.873
What do I love most
about buffets?

02:57.916 --> 02:59.788
In a word... camaraderie.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.790
I thought we'd get together
and do something fun,

03:01.833 --> 03:04.140
go eat cafeteria style,
like at camp.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.707
Camp isn't fun.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.536
They force you to sing

Oh, I thought the <i>horses
were gonna make the music.</i>

03:13.497 --> 03:16.805
Well, forcing us to eat
together isn't camaraderie.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.503
Steve, I'm hearing
that you feel "forced."

03:19.547 --> 03:21.026
Could you expand on that?

03:21.070 --> 03:23.855
I guess these handcuffs give me
that "forced" feeling.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.030
The feelings you're feeling

03:25.074 --> 03:27.468
are very natural
family time feelings.

03:27.511 --> 03:30.645

how I feel about buffets?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.750
- Uncle?
- That's worse.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.666
Dr. Weitzman,
why are you doing this?

10:23.710 --> 10:25.494
Great question, Franny.

10:25.537 --> 10:28.540
Chardonnay, roll tape
and do it like...

10:28.584 --> 10:29.890
Christoph Waltz.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.849
Christoph Waltz mode initiated.

10:36.461 --> 10:40.814
<i>No one knows when
or where Dr. Weitzman was born.</i>

10:40.857 --> 10:44.426
<i>He was abandoned as a baby
in the Lanceton sewers,</i>

10:44.469 --> 10:48.996
<i>where even the rats refused
to be his family.</i>

10:49.039 --> 10:51.651
<i>Dr. Weitzman's adolescence</i>

10:51.694 --> 10:55.132
<i>was spent
in and out of orphanages.</i>

10:55.176 --> 10:59.223
<i>He briefly appeared on
The Mickey Mouse Club</i>

10:59.267 --> 11:01.051
<i>until he caught the attention</i>

11:01.095 --> 11:03.488
<i>of the show's
legendary producer</i>

11:03.532 --> 11:05.577
<i>and was quickly removed.</i>

11:05.621 --> 11:09.016
<i>Then back to his sewers
for doctor school.</i>

11:09.059 --> 11:13.890
<i>But even after becoming
a successful C.I.A. doctor,</i>

11:13.934 --> 11:16.501
<i>he could never find
the right woman.</i>

11:16.545 --> 11:19.722
<i>So he was never able to start
the family</i>

11:19.766 --> 11:21.724
<i>he dreamt of his whole life.</i>

11:21.768 --> 11:23.987
<i>And adoption was out
of the question</i>

11:24.031 --> 11:27.034
<i>because obviously
his appearance</i>

11:27.077 --> 11:28.905
<i>terrifies children...</i>

11:28.949 --> 11:31.168
Chardonnay, did I sign off
on this artwork?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.564
We're screwed.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
You know how stubborn Dad is.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.003
He'll never admit you can have
a bad time at the buffet.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.309
You're right.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.703
If we're getting out of here,
it's up to us.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.098
I did it.

11:48.142 --> 11:51.058
I ate all that disgusting soup.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.537
And now to...

11:53.321 --> 11:55.018
Well, shit.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.980
Come on, that door
has to be the exit!

12:04.375 --> 12:06.726
Oh, you goofy kids!

12:06.769 --> 12:08.292
Always playing pranks.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.338
I think you all
will love it here.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.383
The days are gonna fly by.

12:12.427 --> 12:15.125

Okay, gang,
just checked the time

12:59.039 --> 13:00.910
and it's "rock" o'clock.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.130
Be right back with the acoustic.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.696
I can't do it.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.394
I can't listen to him play

13:06.437 --> 13:08.875
another Death Cab for Cutie
song.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.268
I guess some of them
are technically Postal Service.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.401
I've been trying to smile
through all this,

13:13.444 --> 13:14.663
'cause rules are rules.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.360
But some rules
are meant to be...

13:16.404 --> 13:17.361
Broken?

13:17.405 --> 13:19.059
To a crisp.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.843
I have a plan.

13:20.887 --> 13:24.586
Everybody sneak a Monte Cristo
sandwich into bed tonight.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.414
This plan sounds delicious, Dad.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.416
Don't be cute, Steve.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.680
-Dad!

13:31.723 --> 13:33.464
We all brought sandwiches
to bed.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.509
What's the plan?

13:34.552 --> 13:36.293
Five minutes, son.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.468
Stan!

13:37.512 --> 13:39.775
Chumbawumba!
Okay.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.385
Everything we need
for our escape

13:41.429 --> 13:43.910
is right here
in the Monte Cristo sandwich.

13:43.953 --> 13:46.434
I'll remove it from the baggie
and just lightly touch

13:46.477 --> 13:48.828
the grease-soaked bread
to the sheets.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.788
Wow. And gross.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.446
Next we use the jam.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.887
Wow, that's strong jam.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.716
I think I just figured out
why I almost died of diarrhea.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.894
Wait.
It's powdered sugar time.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.814
We're not going this way,
but it looks cool, right?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.774
Wait, we should grab Klaus!

14:22.818 --> 14:24.341
There's no time!

14:24.385 --> 14:27.910
Next, everyone take the ham
out of your sandwich and eat it.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.912
It's the perfect
protein-rich snack

14:29.956 --> 14:32.219
to keep our motors humming.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.785
Is anyone there?!

14:33.829 --> 14:36.571
It sounds like
four people eating ham!

14:36.614 --> 14:38.225
Good ham.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.796
Oh, man, the forbidden door
is locked!

14:44.840 --> 14:48.975
Luckily, the "Giving Sandwich"
has one last thing to give.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.150
The bread.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.505
This isn't an exit.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.202
It's a graveyard.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.291
Look at the way they're grouped.

15:01.335 --> 15:05.165
I think they're...
other families.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.603
Yes, there are a lot
of dead bodies,

15:08.646 --> 15:10.170
but at least it's not
a gift shop.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.085
I hate crass commercialism.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.087
But the skeletons are for sale.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.349
I make keychains!

15:15.392 --> 15:17.438
Perfect for a gas station bathroom!

15:17.481 --> 15:19.440
Do you have
any gas station owner friends

15:19.483 --> 15:21.529
who have a birthday coming up?

15:24.445 --> 15:28.188
You killed all those families?

15:28.231 --> 15:31.234
What?
No, they killed themselves.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.975
On average,
most offed themselves

15:33.019 --> 15:35.282
after living with Dr. Weitzman
for three days.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.197
Though the current record
is the Shelmerdines,

15:37.240 --> 15:39.242
who only lasted 45 minutes.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.809
That hurt my feelings.

15:40.852 --> 15:44.073
But you guys really hurt
my feelings trying to escape.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.945
I thought you loved me.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.816
Wait, the other families
killed themselves

15:47.859 --> 15:49.252
without trying to escape?

15:49.296 --> 15:52.168
Well, it was before
my online guitar lessons.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.910
Before I got really good.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.085
You suck at guitar.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.826
Yeah, man, you suck at guitar.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.570
Keep it up, guys.
I think this is working.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.919
Keep mocking him.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.790
You have long,
beautiful eyelashes.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.096
No, honey!

16:07.140 --> 16:10.143
Aaand you always cuff
your sleeves like Cam

16:10.186 --> 16:12.319
from <i>Modern Family.</i>

16:12.362 --> 16:14.582
That's not good?

16:14.625 --> 16:16.323
Wizard alert!

16:17.977 --> 16:21.806
Get out!

16:21.850 --> 16:24.070
How'd you know he'd let us go?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.072
Actually I was sure
he was gonna kill us,

16:26.115 --> 16:28.683
so I just wanted
to get it over with.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.514
I can't believe it.
We're home!

16:33.557 --> 16:35.516
There you all are!

16:35.559 --> 16:36.952
You're good hiders!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.780
I've been looking for months.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.869
Jeff, did you think
we were playing

16:40.912 --> 16:42.175
hide and seek this whole time?

16:42.218 --> 16:45.308
In September I doubted it
for a second.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.007
But then I found this clue.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.183
So I took apart
the water heater,

16:50.226 --> 16:51.662
but you guys weren't in there.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.838
There certainly
was a smell, though.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.276
And a lot of scalding water.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.800
And you guys stayed true
to the game.

16:58.843 --> 17:02.456
When I screamed in agony
for help, you stayed hidden.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.589
And you didn't visit me
in the burn ward.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.375
I can't tell you
how much I respect that.

17:08.418 --> 17:12.422
And now the game is over
and I don't know why.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.946
I guess I can return to my life.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.210
Right back in.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.908
Hi.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.436
- Flower delivery!
- Whoo!

17:26.480 --> 17:28.917
Smells like dead bees
and cigarettes.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.919
It's been in the shop
for two months.

17:30.962 --> 17:34.096
Your sweetheart got
an unbelievable price on it.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.838
Adam, you got me flowers?!

17:36.881 --> 17:39.623
I am Adam and I am guilty.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.669
Whoaaaa, that guy's hot.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.411
The dang door's blockin'
the hot body!

17:44.454 --> 17:45.977
I love it!

17:47.457 --> 17:49.459
<i>So I'm a symbol of love.</i>

17:49.503 --> 17:50.808
<i>That's nice.</i>

17:50.852 --> 17:52.419
I can't believe you remembered

17:52.462 --> 17:54.812
that I love grotesque flowers.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.121
Ooh!
Mm.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.995
Stan, I'm happy to be home,

18:04.039 --> 18:07.825
but does
something feel... off to you?

18:07.869 --> 18:09.436
There's no buffet and I hate it.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.002
I'm feelin' it too, Dad.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.787
There was just so much food.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.789
I think that's what I loved
about it.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.661
Sounds crazy,
but maybe we're all...

18:17.705 --> 18:19.576
Concerned about Jeff?
Me too.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.622
I think there's something
really wrong there.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.928
He's not, like, fun stupid,
ya know.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.148
I worry Hayley might be
committing a crime

18:26.192 --> 18:27.367
being married to him.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.064
Maybe we meet with the lawyer,

18:29.108 --> 18:30.761
get on record
what we knew when...

18:30.805 --> 18:32.043
We're talking about the buffet.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.590
Oh, my God, the buffet!

18:33.634 --> 18:35.157
I miss the buffet!

18:35.201 --> 18:37.333
- We all do!
- We gotta go back!

18:37.377 --> 18:39.379
Maybe we just have
Stockholm Syndrome?

18:39.422 --> 18:43.557
If that means overwhelming
desire to break into a buffet,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.168
then I got the stock, homes.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.701
And now for dessert.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.622
<i>They're so in love.</i>

19:05.666 --> 19:07.842
<i>And I'm so relaxed.</i>

19:07.885 --> 19:09.191
Get off me!

19:09.235 --> 19:10.323
He's home early!

19:10.366 --> 19:11.846
<i>Now, who the hell is this?</i>

19:11.889 --> 19:13.021
Jennifer,
what's going on?

19:13.064 --> 19:14.327
What is that hideous flower?

19:14.370 --> 19:16.546
Your wife happens
to love hideous flowers!

19:16.590 --> 19:20.159
My best friend
and business partner!

19:20.202 --> 19:22.161
<i>Oh, my jangled nerves!</i>

19:23.553 --> 19:25.468
<i>Oh, good, they're
all gun owners.</i>

19:25.512 --> 19:27.078
<i>This should
de-escalate quickly.</i>

19:29.864 --> 19:31.866
<i>That's a tip for everyone
at home...</i>

19:31.909 --> 19:34.912
<i>No one ever shoots the flower.</i>

19:37.915 --> 19:40.657
Dr. Weitzman is
never gonna let us back in.

19:40.701 --> 19:41.876
Remember how we used

19:41.919 --> 19:44.183
the Monte Cristo sandwich
to get out?

19:44.226 --> 19:46.228
Here's a sandwich
to help us get in...

19:46.272 --> 19:48.448
a C-4 Sandwich.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.755
There are also some
tuna sandwiches in the bag

19:51.799 --> 19:53.627
in case anyone wants to scarf.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.935
Wait, <i>this</i> is
the C-4 sandwich.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.333
Wait a second.
That means the tuna...

20:04.377 --> 20:06.727
Stan, did you buy
the cheap tuna again?

20:06.770 --> 20:09.120
No! It was me!

20:09.164 --> 20:10.774
You bought the cheap tuna?

20:10.818 --> 20:14.082
No, I blew up the wall
from the inside.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.519
What a twist!
Why?

20:16.563 --> 20:19.087
Because my family
came back to me.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.567
I'm just so excited!

20:20.610 --> 20:22.133
This guy's not cool.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.266
I'm starting to think
this was a mistake.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.747
No, no, no, no,
let me get my guitar!

20:26.790 --> 20:28.444
And some Legos!

20:31.621 --> 20:34.058
You guys came to rescue me!

20:34.102 --> 20:35.886
Yes.
Yes, we did.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.280
Let's not be here
when Dr. Weitzman comes back.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.977
But the buffet!

20:40.021 --> 20:42.110
I still want a dried-out
piece of Dover sole

20:42.153 --> 20:44.243
and a sweaty sweet potato pie.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.420
I guess we could try
the buffet across the street.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.118
"Smiths eat free"?

20:50.161 --> 20:51.554
I like that price.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.252
Come on in!

20:53.295 --> 20:54.601
Leave whenever you like!

20:54.644 --> 20:56.646
I'm not lonely!

20:56.690 --> 20:58.648
Bye-bye!
See you soon!
