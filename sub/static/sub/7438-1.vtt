01:07.000 --> 01:08.250
Always in my dream,

01:08.300 --> 01:09.850
I'm clinging to a branch,

01:09.900 --> 01:13.900
knowing full well that
death inevitably awaits me.

01:18.900 --> 01:24.250
The fear of dying without ever having known
love was greater than the fear of death itself.

01:24.300 --> 01:28.940
I know now I was not alone
in the horror of this darkness.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.300
So, too, was the fear
of Anna Karenina.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.550
It was then that a drop of honey
sweet enough to divert my eyes

02:08.600 --> 02:11.150
from the cruel truth
came into my life.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.550
She was the princess

02:12.600 --> 02:15.200
Ekaterina Scherbatsky.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.860
Thank you, Constantine Dmitrich.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.850
I didn't know that
you were in Moscow.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.700
I arrived yesterday.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.020
I mean, today.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.180
I was going
to come to see you.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.450
I didn't know
you could skate so well.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.600
I'm awful.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.380
But the rumor is that

02:37.600 --> 02:39.920
you are a superlative skater.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.500
Oh, years ago. It used to be
my passion.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.420
Skate with me.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.450
Must be dull in the country
in the winter.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.580
Not at all. I'm very busy.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.250
Mama said that you live
like a barbarian out there

02:58.300 --> 03:00.150
and wear peasant clothes.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.450
There's a lot more to it
than you think.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.180
It's very scientific.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.850
Are you here for long?

03:06.900 --> 03:10.200
I don't know.
That depends on you.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.560
Mama's waiting for me.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.250
- May I call on you?
- We're at home on Thursday as usual.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.400
Today, then.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.600
Au revoir!

03:29.300 --> 03:33.380
You said you wanted my advice
on a delicate matter?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.200
Yes, Stiva.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.360
I think I'm in love...

03:42.500 --> 03:44.700
but I'm plain and too old.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.750
She may be able to love me as a friend,
but I would've to be handsome

03:48.800 --> 03:51.350
and more remarkable to make
her love me as a husband.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.050
Who is the lucky girl?

03:53.100 --> 03:54.380
Can't you guess?

03:55.200 --> 03:55.850
I'd be your brother-in-law.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.200
Kitty.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.650
Do you think there's
any possibility?

03:59.700 --> 04:00.650
Oh, why shouldn't
there be?

04:00.700 --> 04:04.220
For God's sake, be absolutely
frank with me.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.250
I'll tell you something.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.450
My wife Dolly is a most
wonderful woman.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.050
- She can see through people.
- What do you mean?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.950
Well, I mean, not only that
she likes you,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.850
but she says Kitty is certain
to be your wife.

04:16.899 --> 04:18.750
They are sisters,
after all.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.700
She... she said that?

04:25.800 --> 04:28.600
Constantine Dmitrich Levin.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.900
Oh, God.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.680
He's come early.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.150
I don't think I've come
at the right time.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.300
- I'm too early.
- Oh, no.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.550
This is what I wanted...

04:46.600 --> 04:48.500
to find you alone.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.250
The guests should be
here in a moment.

04:51.300 --> 04:56.180
I told you that I didn't know
whether I would be here long...

04:56.500 --> 04:58.420
that it depended on you.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.000
I meant...

05:07.700 --> 05:09.100
I meant do say...

05:13.700 --> 05:15.700
be my wife.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.500
I cannot be.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.500
Forgive me.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.140
It was not meant to be.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.000
Why, Constantine Dmitrich.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.400
Do stay. Have some tea.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
Ah, Constantine Dmitrich.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.440
Back in our corrupt Babylon.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.450
Well, is Babylon reformed,
or have you been corrupted?

05:47.500 --> 05:51.250
That you remembered my words so well.
They must have made an impression on you.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.660
Of course. I note down
everything you say.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.450
What's the matter with Levin today? Why
doesn't he launch into one of his tirades?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.600
Please.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.650
Constantine Dmitrich.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.450
How's it that at home in our village of
Kaluga, the peasants have spent their all

06:06.500 --> 06:09.060
on drink and now pay us nothing?

06:09.400 --> 06:10.950
What is the meaning of that?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.600
You're always so full of praise
for peasants.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.920
Do let me introduce you.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.800
Constantine Dmitrich Levin,

06:19.900 --> 06:22.540
Count Alexei Kirillovich
Vronsky.

06:22.700 --> 06:27.250
Constantine Dmitrich despises
and hates town and us townspeople.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.450
Do you live in the country
all year round?

06:29.500 --> 06:32.050
I should think it must be
rather dull in winter.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.350
Not at all if one has work
to do. Besides, you can't...

06:34.400 --> 06:38.150
- be dull in your own company.
- I like the country.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.050
I'd be bored to tears.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.650
One simply can't live without
sophisticated conversation.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.450
Countess Nordston was telling me

06:44.500 --> 06:48.750
about a demonstration of table
rapping and spiritualism she attended.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.650
Oh, that would be fascinating.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.250
I've never seen anything
supernatural.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.050
Do you believe in spirits,
Constantine Dmitrich?

06:55.100 --> 06:57.450
Why'd you ask me that? You know
perfectly well what my answer will be.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.850
But I want to hear you opinion.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.050
My opinion's that table rapping
merely proves

07:02.100 --> 07:04.650
that the so-called educated classes
are no better than the peasants.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.750
They, too, believe in the evil eyes
and spirits.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.450
But I've witnessed it myself.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.020
But don't you think
there's something in it?

07:12.400 --> 07:15.450
If we admit to the existence
of electricity

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
of which we know nothing,

07:18.500 --> 07:21.350
Why shouldn't there exist
some new forces yet unknown to us?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.850
Because with electricity when
you rub wool and resin together,

07:23.900 --> 07:27.050
you invariably produce a
recognizable phenomenon.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.340
But with this hocus-pocus...

07:31.000 --> 07:32.600
Suppose we try now.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.200
Do let us try,
Princess Kitty.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.100
Ah, Stiva.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.450
Who are you meeting?

07:59.500 --> 08:00.600
My mother.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.050
- You were missed last night.
- Where?

08:04.100 --> 08:06.820
The Chateau des Fleurs,
of course.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.250
My God, there was this wonderful
little girl doing the cancan.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.650
I went home. I felt in such an agreeable
frame of mind when I left the Scherbatskys',

08:15.700 --> 08:17.650
I didn't want to go
anywhere else.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.450
"By the mark of your steed, I can
tell your fine breed

08:20.500 --> 08:23.460
and a young man
in love by his eyes."

08:23.700 --> 08:27.150
- And who are you meeting?
- I've come to meet a pretty woman.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.250
- Oh, indeed.
- Shame on you.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.800
My sister Anna.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.000
Karenin's wife?

08:33.299 --> 08:35.150
Yes, well, you must know her.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.750
I don't think so. I know Karenin
by sight and by repute.

08:38.799 --> 08:42.549
You've a very illustrious brother-in-law.
Very high up in the Ministry.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.350
Yes, a remarkable man.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.650
But not our kind.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.350
Like your friend Levin. I met him last
night, an insufferable fellow.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.400
Oh, you don't appreciate my Levin.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.050
But yesterday there was a reason
for him being out of sorts.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.020
You don't mean he, uh...

08:57.800 --> 08:59.650
Levin has been in love with
Kitty for so long,

08:59.700 --> 09:02.340
and I feel so very sorry
for him.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.400
So that's it.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.700
Excuse me.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.100
You got my telegram?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.640
How are you? Well?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.750
- Have a good journey, mama?
- Anna Arkadyevna!

09:45.800 --> 09:48.100
Can't you find your brother?

09:48.700 --> 09:50.100
Stiva, here!

09:50.600 --> 09:52.450
She's very charming, isn't she?

09:52.500 --> 09:55.650
Poor girl. Her husband refuses
to travel with her. He says he's too busy.

09:55.700 --> 09:59.450
Well, Countess, you've met
your son, I've met my brother.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.250
Pardon me for not recognizing you,
but I don't think we've ever met before.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.150
Anna Arkadyevna

10:04.200 --> 10:06.450
has a little boy of 8, Seriozha.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.050
They've never been
parted before, and she's fretting

10:09.100 --> 10:13.950
at having left him behind. Really,
Anna, you can't expect never to leave him.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.950
Well, good-bye, countess.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.900
Good-bye, my dear.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.320
Very charming.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.200
Horrible.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.400
He's dead.

10:54.900 --> 10:55.950
It is a bad omen.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.800
Nonsense. You've come.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.720
That is the chief thing.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.850
You cannot imagine how much
I'm counting on you.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.650
Stiva, I know you're to blame.
Don't deny it.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.700
9 years... my children...

11:08.500 --> 11:11.150
all to be thrown away
because of a...

11:11.200 --> 11:12.500
momentary lapse.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.200
True. It was not nice

11:16.300 --> 11:19.050
that she was the
children's governess.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.220
What can I do?

11:20.800 --> 11:24.560
Drop me at your house and
go back to the court.

11:24.700 --> 11:25.650
Is this Grisha?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.600
How he's grown!

11:28.900 --> 11:31.140
How happy and well
you look.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.150
He told me.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.200
He met me at
the station.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.280
Grisha, go and find Tanya.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.100
of course she's young,

11:57.600 --> 11:59.000
and she's pretty.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.050
My youth and looks are gone,

12:01.100 --> 12:03.500
taken by him and
his children.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.300
I hate him.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.750
I don't want to speak up
for him,

12:07.800 --> 12:11.050
but what is the best thing to do
in this dreadful situation, Dolly?

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
Stiva is ashamed.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.420
But he made love to her.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.480
I don't excuse him, but...

12:20.600 --> 12:22.200
that's how it is.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.850
Anna's mission to heal the rift
in her brother's family

12:31.900 --> 12:36.650
was not unlike my own desire
to restore the ties with my brother,

12:36.700 --> 12:39.820
so desperate were we both
to feel love.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.300
Good evening.

12:46.600 --> 12:51.000
Excuse me. Is Nikolai Levin here?

12:52.300 --> 12:55.750
There is a gentleman here,
Nikolai Dmitrich.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.100
Nikolai.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.900
Kostya.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.350
What is it?
What do you want?

13:05.400 --> 13:07.550
I don't want anything.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.050
I came to see you.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.540
You're my brother.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.850
This woman is my life's
companion.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.900
Maria Nikolayevna.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.340
I took her out of a brothel.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.820
But anyone who wants
to know me must respect her, too.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.450
All right, then, Masha,

13:36.500 --> 13:38.800
supper for 3, then.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.100
with vodka and wine.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.550
Your brother drinks too much.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.560
Take no notice of her.
She's a whore.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.200
You are a gentleman.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.980
Nikolai, don't drink.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.100
Leave me a...
Leave me alone.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.500
I'll beat you.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.100
How about supper, then?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.300
Have a drink.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.560
Tell me how you do it.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.650
Why aren't you married yet?

14:15.700 --> 14:16.800
Oh, no luck.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.950
I think there must be something
about me that repels people.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.400
Why?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.100
For me, everything's over.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.800
For you...

14:33.700 --> 14:35.300
Come back with me...

14:35.400 --> 14:36.800
to the country.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.540
For the sake of your health.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.450
No. Too much to do.
I've become a communist.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.050
Nikolai, the police.

14:44.100 --> 14:49.140
They'll persecute me like they do
anyone who's not a scoundrel.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.400
Here.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.880
You want to fell
magnanimous...

15:06.100 --> 15:07.400
feel righteous.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.980
I'll let you have that
satisfaction.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.180
Don't think too badly
of me, Kostya.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.200
Mama, please.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.050
Princess Kitty, may I ask you
for the quadrille?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.850
I'm sorry, but I'm promised
to count Vronsky,

15:38.900 --> 15:40.850
but you may have
the second quadrille.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.800
An honor, princess.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.280
The master of ceremonies
can never be refused.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.850
It was nice of you
to come in good time.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.140
Such a bad habit to be late.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.750
- Where may I take you?
- Madame Karenina's over there, I think.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.050
Will you take me to her, please?

17:08.099 --> 17:11.000
Pardon, mesdames,
monsieurs, pardon.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.849
You even dance into the room.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.750
Princess Kitty's one of my
most faithful helpers.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.560
She adorns the ballroom and
makes the ball gay.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.450
- May I have the pleasure?
- No. I never dance if I can help it.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
Oh, but you must tonight.

17:32.300 --> 17:37.260
Well, but if it's impossible
not to dance, let us dance, then.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.900
Well?

18:13.500 --> 18:14.600
Nothing.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.450
Princess, you are such
a delight.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.220
Is your card free
for the mazurka?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.840
I should withdraw.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.220
This is turning out
absurdly.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.650
Will you stay to supper? I have a
wonderful cotillion in mind.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.850
No, I won't stay. I've danced
more at this ball

19:37.900 --> 19:41.420
than I have in a whole winter
in Petersburg.

19:42.700 --> 19:46.200
These few brief moments
intoxicated Anna

19:46.300 --> 19:50.940
like a light pouring into
the dark room that was her life.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.700
We've stopped, mistress.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.400
I want a breath of air.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.920
What are you
doing here?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.680
You know that I have come
to be where you are.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.780
I cannot help myself.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.760
Forgive me if what
I say offends you.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.340
You shouldn't say that.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.250
And I beg you, if you're a gentleman,
to forget this as I will forget it.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.800
Not one word...

21:53.100 --> 21:55.260
not one gesture of yours...

21:56.100 --> 21:57.200
Shall I...

21:57.900 --> 21:59.500
could I ever forget.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.700
Stop it.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.550
Yes, as you see, here is
your devoted husband

22:49.600 --> 22:52.400
burning with impatience
to see you.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.150
Is Seriozha all right?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.350
Is that all the reward
I get for my ardor?

22:57.400 --> 22:59.480
Yes, he's quite all right.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.080
Did you have
a good night?

23:08.500 --> 23:10.180
Excellent. Thank you.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.650
Ah, we've met before, I believe.
Count Vronsky.

23:13.700 --> 23:17.050
You set off with the mother and return
with the son. Back from furlough, I presume.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.150
So, my dear, how was Moscow?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.050
I hope I may have the honor
of calling on you.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.980
Delighted. We're at home
on Mondays.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.100
I told you it was mama!
I knew!

23:46.200 --> 23:47.900
Oh, my pet.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.950
Gifts from Tanya
and Grisha.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.850
Tanya can read now, you know?
She's even teaching Grisha.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.600
Is she nicer than me?

23:59.800 --> 24:03.150
To me you're nicer than anyone
else in the world.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.300
I know I am.

24:13.100 --> 24:16.650
On the whole, then, your
visit was a success?

24:16.700 --> 24:19.750
I cannot see how a man
like that can be exonerated,

24:19.800 --> 24:21.960
even if he is your brother.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.150
But I'm glad it all ended satisfactorily
and that you're back again.

24:26.200 --> 24:30.050
You wouldn't believe how
irksome it is to dine alone.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.900
I missed you, too.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.800
Time for bed.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.700
Betsy,

25:06.900 --> 25:11.250
- I'm beginning to lose hope.
- Whatever hope could you have?

25:11.300 --> 25:12.600
None.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.050
Excuse me. I'm afraid
I've become ridiculous.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.050
Oh, my dear, you're in
no danger of that.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.750
A man pursuing a young girl
might be ridiculous,

25:22.800 --> 25:25.850
but a man in love
with a married woman,

25:25.900 --> 25:27.850
that has something fine
and grand about it.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.550
It could never be ridiculous.
Next you'll be telling me

25:30.600 --> 25:33.650
that young girls should be
virtuous, women chaste,

25:33.700 --> 25:35.650
men virile, and children should be
brought up

25:35.700 --> 25:39.250
to pay their debts and earn their
bread and all the other nonsense.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.820
But look at them...

25:41.400 --> 25:42.500
Karenin,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.750
that awful Lydia Ivanovna.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.900
So old-fashioned,

25:48.100 --> 25:50.420
so stuffy.
They surround her.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.650
When I am old and ugly,

25:53.700 --> 25:55.460
I'll become like them.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.350
For a beautiful woman
like Anna, it is too soon

25:58.400 --> 26:02.000
for her spirit to be crushed
by such boredom.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.800
We must rescue her

26:05.900 --> 26:08.500
before it is too late.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.120
Come to my house
on Saturday.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.250
Is it true that the younger Vlassiev
girl is going to marry Topov?

26:31.300 --> 26:33.650
Yes, they say it's
quite settled.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.850
I am surprised at her parents.
I heard it was a love match.

26:36.900 --> 26:40.660
A love match? What antediluvian
ideas you have.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.650
Who talks of love nowadays?

26:42.700 --> 26:44.350
That foolish old custom's
not left us yet.

26:44.400 --> 26:48.150
The only happy marriages are
marriages of convenience

26:48.200 --> 26:51.250
where both parties have sown
their wild oats.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.950
In my young days, I was
in love with a deacon.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.040
I didn't know that
it did me any good.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.950
No, but joking apart.
I believe that

26:59.000 --> 27:00.750
before one can know
what love really is,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.850
one must have a fall
and pick oneself up again.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.900
Even after marriage?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.500
It's never too late.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.850
I've been wanting to tell you that you
behaved badly, very badly, indeed.

27:20.900 --> 27:24.420
You think I don't know
that I behaved badly?

27:25.500 --> 27:26.780
But who made me?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.450
How can you say that?

27:28.500 --> 27:30.400
You know why.

27:31.300 --> 27:34.020
That only shows
you have no heart.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.850
I came here tonight knowing
that I would meet you

27:41.900 --> 27:43.950
to make it perfectly clear
this must stop.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.650
You make me feel as if
I was guilty of something.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.450
What do you
want me to do?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.350
I want you to go
to Moscow and...

27:50.400 --> 27:52.100
You don't want that.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.200
Then do this for me.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.900
Never utter
those words again.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.360
And let us
be good friends.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.700
Friends
we shall never be.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.520
You know that.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.940
There is only one way
we can be happy.

31:20.700 --> 31:24.140
I have nothing left
but you. Remember that.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.280
Nothing matters anymore...

31:32.500 --> 31:34.200
Not even life...

31:35.400 --> 31:37.250
for one moment
of happiness like this.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.400
Happiness?

31:39.200 --> 31:41.520
Don't ever
speak of it again.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.100
I have to warn you.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.850
Warn me?
What about?

32:20.900 --> 32:24.950
That by thoughtlessness and
indiscretion, you may cause yourself

32:25.000 --> 32:27.400
to be talked about
in society.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.050
You're beginning
to attract attention.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.420
I'm sure
they're only rumors.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.900
You are always like that.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.650
You don't like me to be dull,
and then you don't like it

32:40.700 --> 32:42.950
when I go out
and enjoy myself.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.900
Stop it. You know
I can't stand it.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.050
And I would like to know
what all this is about.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.950
Your feelings are the affair
of your own conscience,

32:51.000 --> 32:54.450
but I am duty-bound to point out
to you your duties.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.550
Our lives have been joined
not by man but by God.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.250
Only a crime
can sever that union.

33:00.300 --> 33:03.250
A crime of that nature brings
its own heavy punishment.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.950
I don't understand
a thing you are saying.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.880
And besides,
I'm desperately sleepy.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.550
Anna, for God's sake, don't
speak like that. Perhaps I am mistaken.

33:12.600 --> 33:16.750
But believe me, what I say
I say as much for my sake as for yours.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.650
I am your husband,
and I love you, but if

33:18.700 --> 33:22.650
- there are the slightest grounds...
- I have nothing to say.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.380
It is really bedtime.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.900
Here it is.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.820
Stupid miss
with the right barrel.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.100
Stiva?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.820
When's Kitty
getting married?

34:33.900 --> 34:36.620
She isn't thinking
about marriage.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.300
She's very ill.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.840
The doctors
have sent her abroad.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.400
Where's Vronsky now?

34:53.900 --> 34:55.420
He's in Petersburg.

34:55.500 --> 35:01.350
He left shortly after you did. And
he's not been in Moscow once since then.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.000
Do you know, Kostya,

35:03.200 --> 35:06.880
I'll be frank with you.
It was your own fault.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.150
You took fright at the sight of your rival.
Why didn't you fight it out?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.250
Kitty was never
serious about him.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.580
She was just attracted
by his good looks.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.000
I tell you candidly

35:19.100 --> 35:21.650
that when she returns
from her cure,

35:21.700 --> 35:26.340
she'll be going to Yergushovo
for some quiet country life.

35:26.900 --> 35:30.740
And that's not too far
from here, Kostya, is it?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.800
I don't know
if you know,

35:39.900 --> 35:41.750
but I don't care.
I'll tell you.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.560
I did make an offer...

35:44.900 --> 35:47.500
but I was rejected.

35:49.700 --> 35:55.350
Now Kitty's nothing more than a
painful, humiliating memory. It's over.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.950
I was hanging down
that dark well,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.850
but the one thing
I held onto

35:59.900 --> 36:01.500
was work.

36:01.700 --> 36:05.700
I clutched it and clung to it
with all my might.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.650
once I lost my temper
with a bailiff

36:08.700 --> 36:12.450
and in a fit of anger took a scythe
and began mowing.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.100
It calmed me,

36:14.600 --> 36:19.200
So I resolved
to mow with them... all day long.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.400
As I mowed,

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
I lost all count of time.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.450
I had no idea whether
it was late or early.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.950
A change came about my work,
which gave me intense satisfaction.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.850
When I forgot what I was doing
and mowed without effort,

36:42.900 --> 36:46.800
My line was almost
as smooth and good as Titus'.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.250
More and more often now
came those moments of oblivion.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.650
When it was not my arms
which swung the scythe,

36:55.700 --> 36:59.200
the scythe seemed to mow
by itself.

36:59.300 --> 37:03.000
Some external force
seemed to propel me on,

37:03.800 --> 37:06.200
as though by magic...

37:06.900 --> 37:10.900
the work did itself
regularly and carefully.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.800
These were the most
blessed moments.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.200
It was she.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.050
It was Kitty...

38:34.100 --> 38:36.100
on her way to Yergushovo.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.200
Quiet, sweet.

38:43.100 --> 38:46.000
Loot at her face, mama.

38:46.700 --> 38:51.700
So spirited and yet so gentle.
I feel she could almost speak.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.300
A fine horse.

38:53.800 --> 38:57.950
Everybody's betting on you.
Not entirely for the right reasons.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.450
What are you
implying, mama?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.400
Don't be coy with me.

39:01.500 --> 39:05.740
You must know how you've
become the center of gossip.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.060
An affair
in the highest society

39:11.300 --> 39:14.750
puts a finishing touch to
a brilliant young man.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.250
Lord knows
I shouldn't preach, but there are those

39:17.300 --> 39:21.850
who are becoming displeased with you,
Alexei. I want you to break it off.

39:21.900 --> 39:23.550
I will not have anyone cast doubt
on the honor of my...

39:23.600 --> 39:26.900
Her honor is nonexistent.
So is yours.

39:27.300 --> 39:30.950
I've been told you've refused
a post in Moscow.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.700
A promotion.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.850
Mother, I would ask you
respectfully not to pry.

39:35.900 --> 39:38.780
You only get one chance
at a career.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.500
Why throw it all away
on some passion?

39:42.600 --> 39:46.440
A brilliant, worldly liaison
I would approve of,

39:46.900 --> 39:49.100
but not this desperate...

39:49.300 --> 39:51.150
Oh, if my love were some ordinary,

39:51.200 --> 39:53.400
vulgar society intrigue,

39:53.500 --> 39:55.600
you would leave me alone.

39:56.300 --> 39:59.740
You have not the remotest
idea what I feel.

40:00.700 --> 40:03.850
I find the lying, the deceit,
the scheming intolerable.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.500
Then give her up.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.900
I wasn't expecting you.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.650
Gracious, what cold hands.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.750
You startled me.

40:48.800 --> 40:53.350
I'm waiting for Seriozha. I... he went out
for a walk. They'll come back this way.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.950
Forgive me. I couldn't go the day
without seeing you.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.520
But shouldn't you be
preparing for the race?

41:00.100 --> 41:02.200
What were you
thinking of?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.800
Please tell me.

41:08.500 --> 41:12.450
Anna, what's the matter?
I can see that something's wrong.

41:12.500 --> 41:15.100
I'm going to have your baby.

41:19.300 --> 41:21.950
Tell him everything
and leave him.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.650
- Oh, my son.
- You must be free of him!

41:23.700 --> 41:25.650
Free to become
your mistress?

41:25.700 --> 41:28.000
When can
I see you? When?

41:29.900 --> 41:31.700
Tonight. 1:00.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.220
Well, I must be
at the races.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.900
Do you like horse racing?

41:58.300 --> 42:00.500
Good-bye.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.350
Seriozha, there is
no need to be so rude.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.200
Papa told me always
to be truthful.

42:20.500 --> 42:23.150
Save your strength
for the finish.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.600
Fine.

42:25.100 --> 42:29.200
Watch out for the water jump.

42:35.200 --> 42:38.100
Are you riding today?

42:44.600 --> 42:46.100
Here we are!

42:46.200 --> 42:50.350
There is so much splendors here.
one's eyes are dazzled.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.050
I will be staying the night.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.460
I am sure you are glad
we can be together.

44:32.200 --> 44:35.600
We can go
if you like.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.520
I again
offer you my arm

45:05.600 --> 45:07.520
if you want
to be going.

45:18.100 --> 45:20.750
I'm obliged to tell you
that your behavior...

45:20.800 --> 45:22.050
What about my behavior?

45:22.100 --> 45:23.600
Be careful.

45:27.300 --> 45:32.420
The despair you were unable to hide
when one of the riders fell.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.100
Possibly I am mistaken.

45:39.300 --> 45:41.750
in that case,
I beg your pardon.

45:41.800 --> 45:45.080
I listen to you,
but I'm thinking of him.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.460
I love him
and I'm his mistress.

45:48.900 --> 45:51.200
I can't endure you,

45:51.300 --> 45:54.300
and I'm desperately unhappy.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.200
You can do
what you like with me.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.450
Is everything all right ma'am?

46:21.500 --> 46:23.300
What time is it?

46:23.900 --> 46:25.800
Almost midnight ma'am.

46:31.700 --> 46:37.700
I've told my husband everything. I must
see you. Come at once to the house.

46:38.300 --> 46:39.500
Count Vronsky!

46:41.200 --> 46:43.600
Ah, General Serpuhovsky!

46:44.100 --> 46:46.050
Brooding on your misfortune?
It won't do at all.

46:46.100 --> 46:47.350
Come on. Let's go and
have something to drink.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.050
I heard news of your promotion. I was
delighted and not a bit surprised.

46:51.100 --> 46:54.950
I heard you refused an important
post. Men like you are wanted.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.500
- By whom?
- By Russia.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.350
Russia needs men.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.450
- The communists are gathering force.
- There're no such things as communists.

47:03.500 --> 47:07.150
Scheming people always have to invent
some dangerous, noxious party.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.850
- It's an old trick.
- Oh, well, I won't fight you.

47:08.900 --> 47:12.150
Shall we go outside? I heard Therese
is going to perform as lady Eve.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.750
I like to see that kind of show
with a gypsy girl on my knee.

47:15.800 --> 47:19.650
- I'm afraid I've an assignation.
- Assignation? No, you don't Vronsky, old boy.

47:19.700 --> 47:22.550
Karenin arrived this afternoon.
Saw him at the races.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.240
I wouldn't keep
that appointment.

48:09.800 --> 48:14.680
I took the liberty of ordering you
some brandy and cucumbers.

48:20.500 --> 48:21.900
Drink the brandy.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.660
Oh, and, this came for you.

48:37.300 --> 48:39.700
Bad news?

48:40.500 --> 48:42.580
She's told him
everything.

48:44.100 --> 48:45.900
I must go to her.

48:59.700 --> 49:00.550
What do you want?!

49:00.600 --> 49:03.880
Sit down! I have something
to say to you.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.050
I know I... I've done wrong
and I'm...

49:06.100 --> 49:09.250
Whatever your conduct may have been,
I don't consider myself justified

49:09.300 --> 49:12.050
in severing the ties through which a
higher power has bound us.

49:12.100 --> 49:13.600
I shall ignore it

49:13.700 --> 49:18.850
as long as the world knows nothing of it,
as long as my name is not disgraced.

49:18.900 --> 49:21.550
And therefore I simply
warn you that our relations

49:21.600 --> 49:23.450
must remain as they've always been.

49:23.500 --> 49:26.150
- I can't be your wife while I...
- So you see nothing wrong with

49:26.200 --> 49:29.050
your infidelity yet refuse to perform
the same duties for your husband!

49:29.100 --> 49:31.100
What do you want
from me?

49:31.200 --> 49:33.920
I want you to never
see him again!

49:34.100 --> 49:37.800
I want you to be
a dutiful wife!

49:38.000 --> 49:40.900
I can't change
what has happened.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Well, understand this.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.850
I'll go to Moscow. I will not return
to this house again.

49:56.900 --> 49:59.750
I'll divorce you
on the grounds of adultery.

49:59.800 --> 50:02.200
My son will go
to my sister's.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.750
No. You must leave me Seriozha.
You don't love him.

50:06.800 --> 50:09.600
I've even lost
affection for my son

50:09.800 --> 50:13.450
because he is associated
with my loathing for you!

50:13.500 --> 50:15.950
But all the same,
I shall take him.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.150
You are a whore.
You have no legal rights.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.250
Alexei Alexandrovitch,
leave me Seriozha.

50:20.300 --> 50:23.020
You know I can't live
without him.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.450
If you'll conduct yourself
so that neither society

50:33.500 --> 50:36.250
nor the servants can find
anything to say against you,

50:36.300 --> 50:39.350
you can enjoy all the privileges
of a respectable wife

50:39.400 --> 50:42.360
without fulfilling
the duties of one.

50:44.900 --> 50:46.980
and you may
keep your son.

51:41.100 --> 51:42.600
Late as usual.

51:44.100 --> 51:47.250
- You have a lot of people here.
- Who's here?

51:47.300 --> 51:48.600
Is Kitty here?

51:51.900 --> 51:55.450
I never did quite believe that there
was anything wrong with my lungs,

51:55.500 --> 52:00.450
but the seclusion and quiet
of Karlsbad were all helpful to me.

52:00.500 --> 52:03.250
I learned how to help care
for the other patients,

52:03.300 --> 52:06.100
those with serious ailments,

52:06.200 --> 52:08.400
and the work suited me.

52:09.400 --> 52:11.050
I learned that there are
so many more important...

52:11.100 --> 52:12.860
I saw you last summer.

52:14.700 --> 52:16.950
Oh, you didn't see me,
but I saw you.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.600
Where?

52:18.800 --> 52:22.650
You were driving to Yergushovo.
My estate's on the way.

52:22.700 --> 52:26.150
It was very early in the morning.
You were probably only just awake.

52:26.200 --> 52:29.800
You had a splendid team
of horses with bells.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.350
You flashed by
in a second.

52:33.400 --> 52:37.720
I saw you through the window.
Your head was like this.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.500
And you were playing

52:39.700 --> 52:42.700
with the ribbons of your cap,

52:43.500 --> 52:47.700
thinking about
something very deeply.

52:49.300 --> 52:52.660
I wish I knew what
you were thinking then.

52:53.100 --> 52:54.500
Really?

52:55.100 --> 52:57.300
I don't remember.

53:08.500 --> 53:09.600
Don't go.

53:14.500 --> 53:18.050
I've a question I've been wanting
to ask you for a long time.

53:18.100 --> 53:19.200
What is it?

53:22.000 --> 53:23.600
Here.

53:34.500 --> 53:37.540
That's the first letters
of the words.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.900
What is that word?

53:40.300 --> 53:43.420
- Never.
- Is it something I once said?

53:46.800 --> 53:48.700
I know what it is.

53:49.100 --> 53:53.500
"When you told me it could not be...

53:54.400 --> 53:57.700
...did that mean never...

53:58.700 --> 54:00.500
...or then?"

54:21.400 --> 54:23.300
I don't know.

54:23.700 --> 54:28.100
"Then I could not answer
differently."

54:29.900 --> 54:32.100
Only then?

55:17.400 --> 55:20.050
He will have reached the church
any moment now.

55:20.100 --> 55:22.100
Word will come.

55:35.500 --> 55:37.500
Oh! This is impossible!

55:38.000 --> 55:40.250
Don't worry. You'll just
have to wear mine.

55:40.300 --> 55:43.950
Yes, well, if I was going to do that,
I should've done it a long time ago!

55:44.000 --> 55:46.800
Everything will
turn out just fine.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.900
Don't you worry.

55:54.300 --> 55:58.860
I went out to buy a new shirt.
all the shops were shut...

56:16.300 --> 56:19.150
I was beginning to think that you had
made up your mind to run away.

56:19.200 --> 56:21.150
What happened to me was
so silly, I was...

56:21.200 --> 56:23.500
I'm ashamed
to tell you.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.950
Kitty should have
stepped on the mat first.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.050
Whoever does
runs the household.

56:55.100 --> 56:56.500
I did.

56:56.700 --> 56:58.460
What about you, Dolly?

56:58.800 --> 56:59.850
I don't remember.

56:59.900 --> 57:01.700
Why on earth not?

57:03.800 --> 57:05.300
I was so in love.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.360
Sir, Madame Karenin
miscarried last night.

57:41.700 --> 57:43.650
My God, how is she?I

57:43.700 --> 57:46.800
Very bad. The doctor
is with her now.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.850
Who is here?

57:59.900 --> 58:00.850
Is... is she...

58:00.900 --> 58:03.900
She has
a very high fever.

58:07.100 --> 58:09.340
Ana Arkadyevna,
he has come.

58:11.800 --> 58:15.550
Has Seriozha had his dinner?
I know they will all forget.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.350
I am entirely
in your hands.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.600
He must be moved
into the corner room...

58:21.100 --> 58:24.400
Maria told
to sleep with him.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.700
I'm not afraid of you.

58:38.500 --> 58:41.300
I know I'm dying now.
You ask him.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.500
I feel it already.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.850
I want only one thing...

58:51.900 --> 58:53.900
for you to forgive me.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.500
Forgive me completely..

59:39.900 --> 59:41.900
There is some hope..

59:42.700 --> 59:44.600
I must stay.

59:45.400 --> 59:47.500
She may ask for me..

59:53.400 --> 59:57.160
I've long wanted to be
revenged on you and her.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.960
When I got the telegram.
I came here with the same sentiments.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.500
But I saw her...

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.700
and forgave her.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.350
And the happiness of
forgiving her revealed to me

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.500
my duty.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.440
I will not
forsake her,

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.120
and I will never utter a word
of reproach to you.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.650
Should she want to see you,
I will let you know.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.600
Now I think
you'd better leave.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.700
Idiot!

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.450
You had the misfortune to fall in love
with man who's not your husband.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.100
This is a misfortune,
but this is a fact.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.700
Your husband
has forgiven you.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.000
Also a fact.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.380
The question is,

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.050
can you go on living
with your husband?

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.140
Do you want to?
And what does he want?

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.300
I don't know.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400
I don't know at all.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.020
I feel I'm flying headlong
over a precipice.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.450
We'll catch you,

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.000
and we won't
let you fall.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.120
There is
nothing left for me,

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.120
except for it
to be all over.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.400
Look at you.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.100
I hardly know you
with this short hair.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.350
You've grown so pretty,
but how pale you are.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400
I'm still very weak.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.700
We'll go to Italy.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.800
You'll soon get well.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.650
We'll live together
as husband and wife.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.950
You'll be ruined.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.550
I resigned
my commission.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.800
Now all I want
is you.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.300
My dear friend,

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.800
you must not give way
to your grief.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.700
You will find support,

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.450
but seek it not in me,

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.400
though I beg you

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.250
to believe in
our friendship.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.400
I will set to work..

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.040
I will be your housekeeper.
Don't thank me.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.900
I do it not of myself.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.050
How can I help
thanking you?

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.600
You must

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.800
thank Him,

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.500
and ask for His help.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.200
In Him alone
can we find peace.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.300
My dear, dear boy.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.020
How unhappy you must be.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.100
I'm quite well,
countess.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.700
Your poor father is...

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.320
too distraught

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.200
to tell you himself,

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500
so he's left it to me.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.100
He is...
a saint,

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.300
you know?

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.520
Your mother...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.100
is dead.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.640
Letters have arrived from town,
Constantine Dmitrich.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:36.250
You see, your lady's settled me here,
told me to sit a little with her.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.700
Here.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.250
I opened
your letter, too.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.450
I think it's from that woman,
your brother's,

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.450
and this is a letter
from home.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.150
Dolly took Grisha and Tanya to a
children's party at the Sarmatskys'.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.100
Tanya went
as a French marquise..

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.140
What's...
what's the matter?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.320
My... my brother
Nikolai is dying.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:06.060
I... I must go to him
I'll leave tomorrow.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.500
Let's go.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.100
Why didn't you
let me know sooner?

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.980
What is so awful
for me...

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.600
is that I can't help...

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.520
remembering him as he was
when he was young.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.900
you can't imagine
what a charming boy he was.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.900
But I didn't
understand him then.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.000
In infinite time...

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.200
in infinite matter...

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.900
in infinite space...

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.900
an organic cell
stands out,

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.700
will hold together
a while...

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.800
and then bursts.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.600
And that cell is me.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.350
I cannot live without
knowing.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:33.560
what I am and why I am here,
and that I cannot know.

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:37.100
So, therefore, I
have no reason to live.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.000
What?

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm pregnant.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.800
Well, don't spare
me now.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.240
It's going
to be perfection.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:00.250
- I'm not going to finish it.
- Why? Why ever not?

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:04.450
Because its defects will become
more and more obvious.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.700
I can't fool myself
that I am an artist.

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:09.899
I am going
to give it up.

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:26.100
I confess I hardly miss
Seriozha at all.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.000
But you do.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.700
Yes.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.020
Let's go back to Russia.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.950
Karenin will
grant us a divorce.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.649
We'll get married,
and we'll be together.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:53.550
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.
I'm so unpardonable happy here,

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.400
away from all of them,
all of that.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.620
I thought you were, too.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.000
Being with you

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.050
is the realization of
all my deepest desires,

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.950
but there is nothing
I can do here.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.100
I need a purpose.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:14.340
That's what I like so much,
having you all to myself.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.500
Seriozha
needs his mother.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.500
Dear Lydia Ivanovna,

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.050
Forgive me for
reminding you of myself.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.750
Count Vronsky and I are
returning to St. Petersburg.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.850
I am unhappy at
being parted from my son.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.050
I beg to be allowed
to see him.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.350
Will you send Seriozha to me, or should
I come to the house at some fixed hour?

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.250
You cannot conceive
the yearning I have to see him

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.050
and so can not conceive the gratitude
your help will arouse in me.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.200
Anna.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.250
I don't think
I can refuse her.

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:57.060
My dear friend,
You never see evil in anybody..

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.650
Her love for her son
exacts...

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.700
But is it love?

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.700
My friend,
is it sincere?

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.550
Have we the right to toy with the
feelings of that little angel?

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.250
He thinks she's dead,

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.000
and he prays for her

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.950
and besieges God
have mercy on her sins,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.100
and it is...

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.500
better.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.300
Madame,

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.400
to remind
your son of you

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.750
Might lead to questions on his part
which it would be impossible to answer.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.550
I beg you to interpret
your husband's refusal

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.300
in the spirit
of Christian love.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.650
I am here to tell you that I look upon my
union with Madame Karenina as marriage.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:00.250
If you wish to be on good terms with me
then you must be on good terms with her.

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.000
Our intimate friends

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.750
can and must look at it
in the proper light.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.000
I for one am so glad
you are back.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.850
I can imagine how horrible our
Petersburg must seem to you

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.300
after your
delightful travels.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.250
- How about the divorce? Is that all settled?
- I'm only waiting for Karenin.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.450
People will throw
stones at me, I know,

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.150
but I shall come
and see Anna.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.050
I will ignore
the conventions,

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.150
but other starchy people
will give you the cold shoulder

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.300
until you are married,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.650
and that's
so simple nowadays.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:34.650
Of course, I cannot invite her to my
home. I have daughters growing up.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.850
How can you
say that..

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.980
When everyone knows you were
Tushkevich's mistress?

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.200
How dare you
make comparisons?

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.660
Aliosha, darling,

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.140
You hardly have
the moral high ground.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.500
The doctor.
It's time.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.240
Are you all right?

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.540
Get out of here,
Kostya! Go!

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.120
Lord have mercy on us
and help us.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.800
A boy too!

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.440
You may ease your mind.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.650
all is well.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.500
Show him to his Papa!

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.750
That's how they are
when they come out.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.100
This one is a beauty.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.700
Seriozha...

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.400
my darling.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.250
They told me
you were dead.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.150
You didn't believe it,
my precious.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.200
I never believed it!

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.950
Oh no, you'd never
have let her in!

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.650
Ten year's service and nothing but
Kindness from her,

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.050
and you'd have got up
and shown her the door.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.740
He'll get up presently and
you will be out on the streets.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.150
Don't go. He won't
come just yet.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.450
Seriozha, my darling,
you must love him.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.050
He's better than I am,
and I have been wicked to him.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.460
When you're grown up,
you will understand.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.000
Don't go.
Mama!

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.450
Get out! Our door
is closed to you!

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:34.260
You're not welcome here!
You deserted your son!

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:49.650
The laudanum prescribed for Ana
after the loss of her child

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:54.900
Now became the opiate used to
deaden the pain of Seriozha's loss.

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.300
Why shouldn't I go?

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.520
You are going.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.760
Oh, of course, there's
no reason whatever.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.380
That's exactly
what I say.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:33.250
Anna, for heaven's sake,
what has come over you?

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.940
I don't understand
what you mean.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.060
You know you can't go
into the opera.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.900
Why not?

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.250
I'm not going alone.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.420
I'm... I'm going
with princess Varvara.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.200
Princess Varvara...

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.860
Is little more
than a courtesan.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.780
She's no worse
than the others.

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.950
Besides, I am not ashamed
of what I have done.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.800
I'm not ashamed
of my love for you.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.900
And whom
are you accompanying?

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.350
You've been out
with your mother quite a bit lately.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.250
Anna, she is my mother.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:25.500
I hear your mother has taken on
princess Sorokina as a companion.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.450
Why don't you make your mother
happy and marry her?

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:34.380
Anna, I have not the slightest interest
in princess Sorokina.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.380
How do you think
that makes me feel?

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.200
What?

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.650
How am I
supposed to feel?

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.620
You spend your evenings
with a pretty young girl.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.350
What do I know?
Only what you tell me.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.300
Oh, you don't trust me?

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.600
Why can't I go out?

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.120
I love you, and nothing
else matters to me..

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.920
So long as you
haven't changed....

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.420
As long
as you still love me.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.900
Oh, look at me.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.660
all we need
is the divorce.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:25.900
I know how difficult your
situation must be until then,

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:30.050
but, please, don't make matters worse.
Please, please, don't go.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.800
Oh, I'll stay,
as you wish..

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.050
Princess Sorokina.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.500
Your mama
is asking for you.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.220
Good evening, mama.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.150
I'm sorry to be late.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.280
Well, you're here now,
and that's all that matters.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:03.150
You're not worthy of him.
You've lost your child! You're a whore.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.100
You're a whore!

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.800
You deserted him!

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.550
Excuse me. You seem to be putting me
in the position of defendant. I was given

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.550
to understand that Anna declines a
divorce if I insist on keeping the boy.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.550
I replied to her in that sense
and considered the matter closed.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.100
Alexei Alexandrovich,
you are a good man.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.750
Put yourself in
her position for a moment.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.250
She's moved to Moscow.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.050
She's been there 6 months now,
each day expecting your decision.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:00.350
I'm a believer now. I can't go against the
teachings of Christianity in such a matter.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.160
Why, divorce is sanctioned,
even by the church.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.750
I must think it over.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.200
I must seek guidance.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.100
What do I see?

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.200
Ah, Yes. That's right.

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.450
We must go away.
I long to be in the country,

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.050
and there's nothing
to keep you here, is there?

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:35.050
- My one wish is to get away.
- You know, it came over me like an

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.950
absolute inspiration. Why should we
go on waiting here for the divorce?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.550
I've made up my mind that it
shan't influence my life anymore.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.100
- Do you agree?
- Oh, yes..

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.850
Well, how was
your dinner party?I

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.450
Oh, the dinner
was first-rate

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.850
and the boat race
and all that quite enjoyable.

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.660
Well, when are we off?

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.060
The sooner the better.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.850
We can't get off
tomorrow, I'm afraid,

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:01.050
but we could be ready
the day after.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.860
Oh, no. Wait a moment.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.650
The day after tomorrow is Sunday,
and I have to see mama.

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:06.950
- You could go there tomorrow.
- No, I'm going there on business

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.650
to do with the power of attorney,
and the money won't be ready tomorrow.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.750
In that case, then,
we won't go at all.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.150
I won't go any later!
Monday or not at all!

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.200
Why? There's
no sense in that..

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.940
You see no sense in it because...

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.560
because you care
nothing for me.

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:24.850
You seem unable
to see my position.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.850
How do you think I feel
cooped up in these rooms?

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.900
But you are free.
Yes, you are free,

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.250
and if you don't love me anymore, that
would be better and more honest to say so.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.150
Oh, really! This
is becoming unbearable!

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.850
Why do you try my patience?
It has it's limits.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:42.950
What do you mean
by that?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.300
I mean...

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.850
I mean, well,
what do you want of me?

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:49.750
What I want is that you should not desert
me as you are thinking of doing.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.640
No. I don't want that.
what I want is your love,

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.050
but it has gone,
so it is all over.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.460
Wait. Wait. Wait!

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.940
What is this all about?

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:04.150
I said that me must put off our departure
for a matter of 3 days,

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.050
and you, Anna, sit by accusing me of
lying and being dishonorable.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:13.050
It is a matter of complete indifference to me
what your mother thinks and whom she

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:14.860
wants to marry you to.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.550
But we're not talking
about that.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.400
Precisely about that!

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:21.550
I know all about that
little princess Sorokina,

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.250
and let me tell you,
a heartless woman..

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:27.050
Be she old or not old, your mother or
anyone else is of no consequence to me,

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.350
and I do not want to have
anything to do with her.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.800
I will not have you speak
disrespectfully of my mother.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.660
There's a limit
to my endurance.

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.700
Why didn't I die?

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.400
Mashka is going
to eat your banana!

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.850
Who is that telegram from?

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.950
- It's from Stiva.
- Can I see it?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.050
It is addressed to me.

01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.050
What secrets
can Stiva have from me?

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:28.450
I don't want you to see it because
Stiva has a passion for wiring.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.450
Why telegraph
when nothing is settled?

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.600
He wires:

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.050
could get nothing out of him.
Promises definite answer soon.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.100
Read it yourself.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.200
Little hope, and I'll do everything
possible and impossible.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:46.950
I don't care about
the divorce anymore,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.850
And there was not the slightest
necessity to hide this from me.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.700
I just want things
to be definite.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.250
I am sure your irritability is due to
the uncertainty of your position.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.540
And why did princess Sorokina
deliver this telegram?!

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.200
She did not.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.850
This arrived earlier
while you were sleeping.

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:09.150
Princess Sorokina came with the money
and the documents from my mother.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.950
I couldn't get them
yesterday.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.680
I didn't want anything
to delay our departure.

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.250
By the way,

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.820
we are definitely
going tomorrow, aren't we?

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.100
You are...

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.100
but not me.

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.650
Ana, we can't
go on like this.

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.700
You are, but not I!

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.700
This is intolerable!

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.500
You will be sorry
for this.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.660
God,
forgive me everything.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.900
I have here...

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:04.450
the latest dispatch...
from the front!

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:08.300
The infidel Muslims
have been driven back!

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.500
We Russians...

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.540
have flown to help

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.500
our Serbian Slavonic brothers,

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.900
our fellow Christians!

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.750
Count Vronsky.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.650
Perhaps you'd rather not have seen me.
If so, please don't hesitate to say.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.250
I can always find
another compartment.

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.500
No. Please.

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.860
The Serbian war
is a blessing for me.

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:48.700
As a man I have the merit that my
life is of no value to me.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.650
I'm glad there's something for which I may
lay down the life which isn't simply useless,

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.500
but loathsome to me.

01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.100
Anyone is welcome to it.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.050
I know the dreadful
thing you have suffered,

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.650
But I beg you not to continue
on this course you are following.

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.650
I am doing my duty
as a Russian...

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:10.980
and a Christian.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.700
Please, hear me out.

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.300
I saw your lady only once.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:25.400
I wish I'd spoken up then,
but I did not.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.100
which is why I cannot
remain silent now.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.750
Ever since the death
of my brother,

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.750
all I have been searching for are
answers to questions like,

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.850
"what am I?", "why am I here?"

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.250
"What am I living for?"

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.250
When, suddenly,
it all became clear to me.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:47.150
I'd been living on spiritual truths
that I'd drunk in with my mother's milk,

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.760
but I'd never
acknowledged them.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.850
I know what is right and wrong.
I wasn't taught this..

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.650
It was given to me, as it is to everyone.
I discovered nothing.

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:59.820
I merely opened my eyes
to what I knew.

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.400
For me it is too late.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:09.220
As a man, I am finished. As a weapon,
I may be of some use.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.100
Don't think ill of me.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.900
I have lost too much.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.720
all I ask is to be able
to remember Anna as she once was...

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.500
when I first met her.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.840
I try to bring back
those moments, but I cannot.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.600
I cannot
see her face.

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.260
I can only see her
laid out

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.600
in the railway shed
where they took her.

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:42.300
She was...

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.750
This new feeling
has not changed me.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.350
It has not made me happy
and enlightened all of a sudden

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.200
as I dreamed it would.

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:25.150
just like the way it was with
my feeling for my son.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.750
- Come to the nursery at once.
- Is something wrong with Mitya?

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.150
There was no surprise
about this, either.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.550
- What's going on?
- Mitya wants to see you.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.450
But be it faith or not.
I don't know what it is.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:41.450
Through suffering, this feeling has crept
just as imperceptibly into my heart.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.300
He knows me.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.300
and has lodged
itself firmly there.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:55.550
I shall still be unable to understand
with my reason why I pray,

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:58.700
and I shall
still go on praying.

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:01.800
But my life now...

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:06.150
my whole life... independent of
anything that can happen to me,

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.050
every minute of it is no longer
meaningless as it was before,

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.250
but has a positive meaning
of goodness

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.900
with which I have
the power to invest it.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.300
Lev Tolstoy.
