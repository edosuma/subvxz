00:19.227 --> 00:21.980
your host here

00:22.147 --> 00:26.443
And today, we're chattin' about
the new season of <i>Captain Underpants!</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:29.904
But first, let's look back
at some highlights from season one.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.698

00:42.625 --> 00:44.025
- Wow, lotta screaming.
- Looks fun.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.964
And as we all remember, season one
ended up with you guys being expelled,

00:48.047 --> 00:49.257
[Rap] <i>Mr. Krupp being fired</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:52.177
<i>and grown-up cyborg Melvin
traveling back in time from the future</i>

00:52.260 --> 00:53.845
and taking over the school.

00:53.928 --> 00:57.474
[loudly] What is going on here?
I didn't authorize a talk show!

00:57.557 --> 00:58.683
And who is this guy?

00:58.767 --> 01:02.520
Hey, it's Mr. Krupp,
everyone's favorite principal to hate!

01:02.645 --> 01:04.230
- Boo! More boo!
- [crowd] <i> Boo!</i>

01:04.313 --> 01:06.816
And where is that crowd noise coming from?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.276
The My-Hammy-Sound Machine!

01:08.526 --> 01:09.778
<i>Boo!</i>

01:09.861 --> 01:13.198
You're trespassing!
I'm gonna have you all arrested!

- Hey, you're that guy with the mouth.
- I am!

01:21.748 --> 01:24.918
So, Cap, how about a spoiler
from the first episode of the new season?

01:25.001 --> 01:27.295
Okay. I'm not in it.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.379
- What?
- Yeah.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.799
But the show's called <i>Captain Underpants.</i>

01:30.882 --> 01:33.718
Yeah, someone's getting fired, for sure.

[narrator] <i>Chapter one: Melv-Interruption.</i>

02:08.919 --> 02:11.422
<i>While this may look
like Jerome Horwitz Elementary,</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:15.301
<i>it is now Melvin Sneedly Elementary,
with Snooty Latin Motto Coming Soon.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:16.469
[scraping]

02:16.553 --> 02:19.055
FYI, I never liked you, Miss Anthrope.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.895
Eliteanati Academy rejected my appeal!

02:26.104 --> 02:28.815
They even returned
the gift basket of inert gases I sent!

02:28.898 --> 02:31.317
What part of "Send muffins" was unclear?

02:31.401 --> 02:32.902
- I'm doomed!
- No matter.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.445
Once we've turned this school

02:34.529 --> 02:37.031
into a world-class institution
of learning,

02:37.115 --> 02:40.618
Eliteanati will be begging for you,
its star student, to attend.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.162
You're right. And the best part is,

02:42.245 --> 02:45.665
no annoyingly vexatious
George and Harold to interfere.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.250
Hello, Melvins!

02:47.333 --> 02:48.459
What are you doing here?

02:48.543 --> 02:50.879
- I expelled you when I took over!
- Yeah, we were there.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.131
But we couldn't tell our parents.
They'd kill us!

02:53.214 --> 02:54.674
So we pretended to go to school

02:54.757 --> 02:57.135
but then did a bunch
of really cool things instead.

02:57.218 --> 03:00.018
- [Harold] <i>We climbed Mt. Everest.</i>
- [George] <i>Visited the Eiffel Tower.</i>

03:00.054 --> 03:01.414
[Harold] <i>We even went to the moon!</i>

03:01.472 --> 03:02.974
- You're lying!
- Yeah, you're right.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.184
When the new school Superintendent,
Grace Wain,

03:05.268 --> 03:07.812
found out about
the whole rulebook thing, she said...

03:07.896 --> 03:10.940
"Mr. Krupp's handwritten rules
aren't official rules

03:11.024 --> 03:14.277
so the expulsion of George Beard
and Harold Hutchins is repealed"?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.155
- Agh! Foiled by bureaucracy!
- How did you not see that coming?

03:17.238 --> 03:20.283
There are a lot of moving parts
to this plan! I can't think of everything.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.785
But she can't stop me
from Melvinizing the school.

03:22.869 --> 03:26.289
We'll make this place the smartest,
most superior elementary school anywhere!

03:26.372 --> 03:29.792
- [cackling]
- Because that's what we're doing!

03:30.126 --> 03:32.503
[cackling]

03:34.881 --> 03:37.926

[narrator]
<i>So to impress Eliteanati Academy,</i>

03:59.781 --> 04:02.325
<i>the Melvins made classes much harder.
Even for the teachers.</i>

04:02.408 --> 04:03.910
Uh, hmm...

04:03.993 --> 04:08.998
Today we'll be studying, um...
"Puh-hy-six?" What's that?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.334
Physics, you incurious meat sack!

04:11.417 --> 04:12.502
Hey!

04:12.585 --> 04:13.795
We're learning Melviny stuff?

04:13.878 --> 04:16.755
Krupp was bad, but at least
when he was here we didn't have to learn.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.801
- We're doomed.
- That you are, you unripe bananas.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.884
Hey.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.262
Here goes.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.264
Uh... [groans]

04:24.472 --> 04:27.642
- I like Puh-hy-six! [chuckles]
- This is my new favorite class!

04:27.725 --> 04:29.602
- [grunts]
- [school bell rings]

04:29.686 --> 04:34.315
This is gym? They got rid of gym class?
That was the easiest class we have!

04:34.399 --> 04:35.566
P.E. is a waste of time.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.112
So instead of hurling projectiles,
we'll learn computer science!

04:39.195 --> 04:40.195
On.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.948
On. On.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.575
On, you stupid yeah-yeah-yeah machine. On!

04:44.659 --> 04:45.743
It's not plugged in.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.413
You leave me no yeah-yeah-yeah choice! On!

- No. <i>This </i> is my new favorite class!

04:57.255 --> 04:58.589
[grunts] Ugh!

04:58.673 --> 05:03.011
And now we add
the, um, magnesium to the acid?

05:03.094 --> 05:06.723
Not magnesium.
Chromium, you doorknob with legs!

05:06.806 --> 05:07.806
Hey!

05:08.182 --> 05:09.767
[trickles, bangs]

05:10.935 --> 05:12.979
You created a dimensional vortex!

05:13.229 --> 05:15.398

- Okay, this is definitely

05:15.481 --> 05:17.483
- my new favorite class.
- [grunts]

05:19.027 --> 05:23.031
- Ugh... What's this stuff?
- Synthesized bio-matter nutrient bricks.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.159
Yeah, sounds delicious. Oh, almost forgot.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.995
We love what you and future you
are doing with the school,

05:29.078 --> 05:30.955
- so we got you a little gift.
- It's muffins.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.000
You're not supposed to be enjoying this.
[snaps] I am! Humph!

05:36.627 --> 05:37.627
Humph!

05:37.754 --> 05:40.214
- [crunches]
- Ugh! Tastes like a driveway.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.175
I don't know. It's kinda growing on me.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.092
[boy] <i>Ooh, what?</i>

05:43.176 --> 05:46.095
Minus the food bricks,
this Melvinized school is awesome.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.389
Yeah, it's a shame
Melvin didn't come from the future

05:48.473 --> 05:50.224
and replace Mr. Krupp years ago.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.477

05:58.775 --> 06:00.985
I'm looking for a principal's desk.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.738
- Is that even a thing?
- Are <i> you </i> even a thing?

06:07.283 --> 06:09.786
These so-called teachers
know even less than the students!

06:09.869 --> 06:11.537
How will I get into Eliteanati like this?

06:11.621 --> 06:15.083
You won't.
That's why I'm replacing the teachers.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.335
Oh, muffin basket?
Is there a blueberry in there?

- Seen it. Let's make a comic.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

<i>One time, these mean robots kicked all

11:59.593 --> 12:01.929

<i>and because robots are mean
and smell like metal and hate dance music.</i>

12:05.433 --> 12:06.809
<i>So Sergeant Boxers showed up</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:10.271
<i>and he was all like, "What's up, robos?
You wanna fight? Let's do this!"</i>

12:10.354 --> 12:12.398
<i>And the robots
were all "Beep, bop, borp, borp!"</i>

<i>and Sergeant Boxers was, like,
"I don't speak robo, so we have to fight."</i>

<i>So, Sergeant Boxers started punching,</i>

<i>"This is a problem.
I gotta learn how to hero!"</i>

12:31.292 --> 12:33.627

- Whoops, I got all of that one.
- Come with us if you wanna live.

18:56.718 --> 19:00.639
But we're alive now.
And happy, for the very first time.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.809
Okay, uh, come with us
if you want your old jobs back.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.104
- Pass.
- Okay, then come with us

19:07.187 --> 19:08.438
if you want better coffee!

19:08.522 --> 19:09.522
[cheering]

19:10.983 --> 19:13.777
Good! And when you're done with the slide,
get to work on the swings.

19:13.861 --> 19:17.698
Oh, it's a shame George and Harold
aren't here to witness the end of recess.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.199
I know they love it so.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.450
[both] Hello, Melvins!

19:20.534 --> 19:23.537
- Ugh, stop doing that!
- No underwear hero?

19:23.620 --> 19:24.997
There's a new Sergeant in town!

19:25.080 --> 19:26.999
Check me out, bro-comotives.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.419
I'm Sergeant Big Boy Boxers,
and I am jacked!

19:30.502 --> 19:32.004
- Help!
- Seriously?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.423
I am always serious about being jacked.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.759
Mech versus Monster fight?
Color me Melv-intrigued.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.806
[both grunting]

19:48.103 --> 19:49.771
[grunting]

19:51.106 --> 19:52.858
[grunting continues]

20:03.160 --> 20:05.621
Aw. That sounded much cooler
than it actually was.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.538
Tell me about it.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.956
Should we start over?

20:09.708 --> 20:10.708
[grunts]

20:12.836 --> 20:14.588
- [honks]
- [rattles]

20:16.256 --> 20:17.674
- [whinnies]
- [whirs]

20:17.758 --> 20:18.967
Class dismissed.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.887
Ooh, great line.
But we gotta help Sarge, he's outgunned!

20:21.970 --> 20:26.016
Not if we uncouple the robot's mainframe
and reroute its processor...

20:26.099 --> 20:29.228
Through a hyperware external drive
to clone an input control!

20:29.311 --> 20:30.395
- [both] Yes!
- What?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.814
I guess all those robot classes
soaked into my brain.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.483
[beeping]

20:35.234 --> 20:37.277
Mine, too.
And I wasn't even paying attention!

20:37.361 --> 20:38.654
[beeping]

20:39.071 --> 20:40.906
Sarge, let's crash this bot!

20:41.573 --> 20:42.574
Here we bro!

20:42.658 --> 20:44.159
Get us to the interface panel!

20:44.243 --> 20:46.411
Wow, I can't believe I know that! Agh!

20:47.746 --> 20:49.706
[both screaming]

20:52.209 --> 20:54.753
- Stop! You shouldn't know that!
- He's right!

20:54.836 --> 20:57.464
The only one who should be learning
around here is Melvin!

20:57.547 --> 21:00.717
- Reroute the protospanner, and done!
- [beeps]

21:00.801 --> 21:02.678
- Sarge, let's bug out!
- <i>Too-de-loo!</i>

21:02.761 --> 21:04.012
- Did it work?
- No clue.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.098
[beeping]

21:10.811 --> 21:13.522
- Huh! It did work!
- Now we can forget all that stuff!

21:13.605 --> 21:17.150
No matter, we'll just build
bigger, better bots that you can't hack!

21:17.234 --> 21:19.194
Each day you're here
will be worse than the last!

21:19.278 --> 21:20.654
Not on my watch.

21:20.737 --> 21:25.242
Because I'm Grace Wain,
the new superintendent.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.619
- Thanks for the video, boys.
- What video?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.789
<i>And each day you're here,
will be worse than the last!</i>

21:30.872 --> 21:32.152
But he literally just said that!

21:32.207 --> 21:34.367
Yeah, I was down the street
getting breakfast burritos.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.978
- You get the six for six?
- I'm hungry, so I'll make this quick.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.131
If you target George and Harold
in any way,

21:39.214 --> 21:42.301
I'll process your termination forms
so fast, it'll make your head spin.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.637
Also, this school isn't zoned
for robot teachers... yet.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.807
[grunts]
Foiled by idiotic bureaucracy again!

21:48.932 --> 21:51.518
[gasps] I mean, bureaucracy. Yay.

21:51.601 --> 21:54.479
Seriously, how are you me,
but you didn't see this coming?

21:54.563 --> 21:55.563
Moving parts!

21:55.689 --> 21:58.400
Now lose the bots, and get back to work.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.526
[both] Yes, ma'am.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.610
Nothing but net.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.613
And you! Wash off that face paint
and put some pants on!

22:03.697 --> 22:04.990
But I'm a superhero!

22:06.742 --> 22:07.784
Yes, ma'am.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.579
- Thanks for saving us. Again.
- Don't thank me.

22:10.746 --> 22:14.416
You two are on thin ice.
No more funny business.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.499
[both] Yes, ma'am!

22:15.542 --> 22:16.543
But between us...

22:17.544 --> 22:18.545
that was epic.

22:18.628 --> 22:19.921
You thinking what I'm thinking?

22:20.005 --> 22:23.925
Yup. Melvin Sneedly Lamementary.
It's Now Cool To Toot.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.261
- [chuckles] It was always cool. [spurts]
- Nice.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.638
Can you imagine
what Krupp would do to us for this?

22:28.722 --> 22:29.765
Yeah. [sighs]

22:29.848 --> 22:32.642
- You know, I kinda miss him.
- Me, too.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.562
And somewhere out there,
I bet he misses us.

22:35.645 --> 22:38.315
All right, look, fine,
I'm not your principal!

22:38.398 --> 22:41.276
Please, let me go! Yagh! No!
