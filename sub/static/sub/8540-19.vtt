00:13.709 --> 00:16.538
[car door closes]

00:24.198 --> 00:26.287
HEY.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.291
ARE YOU MR. BLACK?

00:30.291 --> 00:33.163
YEAH.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.860
YOU SCARED ME.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.646
[chuckles] YEAH.

00:37.646 --> 00:40.344
SO...

00:40.344 --> 00:42.303
I JUST...

00:42.303 --> 00:45.262
TELL ME WHY I'M HERE.

00:45.262 --> 00:49.136
I HAVE SOMETHING I NEED DONE.

00:49.136 --> 00:52.487
SO DO MOST WOMEN. YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

00:52.487 --> 00:55.751
RIGHT. YES. SORRY.

00:55.751 --> 00:58.754
UM, WHAT I NEED...

00:58.754 --> 01:01.061
I DON'T KNOW
QUITE HOW TO PUT IT.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.585
WELL, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH

01:03.585 --> 01:07.458
AND SAY IT OUT LOUD
IN FULL DETAIL,

01:07.458 --> 01:09.678
LIKE YOU'RE TALKING
TO YOUR PRIEST.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.161
YOU SHOW ME YOURS.
I'LL SHOW YOU MINE.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.511
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.513
OKAY.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.515
HERE.

01:20.515 --> 01:23.648
I WANT YOU TO KILL HIM.

01:23.648 --> 01:40.883
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE?

01:40.883 --> 01:42.798
[police radio chatter]

01:45.192 --> 01:47.585
WE THINK SHE WAS KILLED
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.935
NEIGHBOR HEARD SCREAMING,
CALLED 9-1-1.

01:49.935 --> 01:53.374
ANYBODY SEE ANYTHING?WE'VE GOT SAC P.D. CANVASSING,
BUT SO FAR NOTHING--

01:53.374 --> 01:55.376
JUST AN AVERAGE NIGHT.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.986
AVERAGE NIGHT,
AVERAGE NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:56.986 --> 01:58.335
AVERAGE MURDER.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.294
WHY ARE WE HERE?

02:00.294 --> 02:03.601
BECAUSE THE VICTIM IS ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY KELLY FLOWER.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.951
YOU WORKED WITH HER.YEAH, WE ALL DID.
KELLY WAS GOOD PEOPLE.

02:05.951 --> 02:09.085
FORENSICS FOUND A CASING.
SAID IT WAS 9-MIL.

02:12.306 --> 02:15.439
ALMOST POINT-BLANK,
JUDGING FROM THE STIPPLING.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.833
DEPUTY CORONER
SAID NO SEXUAL ASSAULT,

02:17.833 --> 02:21.271
BUT HER NIGHTGOWN'S
RIPPED AND TANGLED.SHE WAS CRAWLING IN IT.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.926
REMODEL?

02:23.926 --> 02:26.972
KELLY'S ONE OF US. HIGHTOWER'S
ALREADY APPROVED THE OVERTIME.

02:26.972 --> 02:30.933
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.WHY IS THAT THE DRILL?
I MEAN, FOR EVERYONE ELSE,

02:30.933 --> 02:33.414
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE FOR YOUR OWN,
YOU TRY HARDER.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.938
WE DO.IT'S A DETERRENT.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.897
IT SENDS OUT A MESSAGE--NOBODY
GETS AWAY WITH KILLING A COP,

02:38.897 --> 02:42.640
A JUDGE OR A D.A.CHO CAN GET A LIST
OF KELLY'S CASES,

02:42.640 --> 02:47.036
SEE WHO SHE PUT AWAY
THAT HELD A GRUDGE.IT'S NOT A DETERRENT.
IT'S REVENGE, REALLY.

02:47.036 --> 02:49.517
I MEAN,
AND THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM,

02:49.517 --> 02:51.388
'CAUSE I'M ALL ABOUT REVENGE.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.999
I MEAN, REVENGE CAN BE
VERY PRODUCTIVE.PRODUCTIVE?

02:53.999 --> 02:56.263
WELL, TAKE RIGSBY.
VAN PELT BREAKS UP WITH HIM.

02:56.263 --> 02:59.570
NOW HE'S IN THE BEST SHAPE
OF HIS LIFE.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.617
I MEAN, HE'S HITTING THE GYM,
WHAT, SIX TIMES A WEEK?

03:02.617 --> 03:05.402
LOOK AT HIM. HE IS BRIMMING
WITH SEXUAL CONFIDENCE.JANE, CUT IT OUT.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.144
[Van Pelt] NOT ON MY ACCOUNT.
IT'S FINE.

03:08.144 --> 03:11.539
SEE? FINE. MY POINT--THERE IS
NOTHING WRONG WITH REVENGE.

03:11.539 --> 03:15.064
VAN PELT, ANY DAMAGE TO
THE WINDOWS OR THE BACK DOOR?

03:15.064 --> 03:18.459
NO, NOTHING.NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY,
SO EITHER SHE LET HIM IN, OR...

03:18.459 --> 03:21.113
[Rigsby] HUSBAND'S HERE.HE LET HIMSELF IN.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.638
OH, MY GOD! NO!

03:23.638 --> 03:25.030
KELLY, NO!

03:25.030 --> 03:28.120
NO! [crying]

03:28.120 --> 03:32.995
NO! GOD, NO!

03:39.915 --> 03:43.135
TIFFANY WANTS YOU
TO CALL HER BACK.OH, THANKS.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.529
SAID TO TELL YOU
YOU'RE A VERY BAD BOY.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.749
DID SHE?

03:47.749 --> 03:50.012
AGENT HIGHTOWER, HI.MORNING.

03:50.012 --> 03:53.189
YOU TWO KNOW MARC ODENTHAL
FROM THE D.A.'s OFFICE?SURE. HEY.

03:53.189 --> 03:56.627
[Cho] HI.WE'RE GONNA TALK
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

03:56.627 --> 04:00.152
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT KELLY'S CASE?WE'RE LOOKING AT ANYBODY
WHO HAD ACCESS TO THE HOUSE

04:00.152 --> 04:03.112
FROM WORK, THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
THE LOCAL DOG PARK, ANYWHERE.HUSBAND?

04:03.112 --> 04:05.767
FLOWER WAS TOO UPSET
TO TALK LAST NIGHT.

04:05.767 --> 04:09.466
JANE AND I ARE HEADING
OVER THERE NOW.AND WE'VE GOT A LIST
OF PAST DEFENDANTS.

04:09.466 --> 04:13.905
AT LEAST FOUR HAVE EXPRESSED
WRITTEN OR VERBAL THREATS.THE D.A. TOLD ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.690
IT INCLUDES HER CURRENT CASES.HANG ON. HANK DRABER.
THE SMUGGLER?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.867
SMUGGLING DRUGS,
CONSPIRACY TO MURDER.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.565
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO LAY A GLOVE ON 'EM BEFORE.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.742
DRABER'S TRIAL WAS SUPPOSED
TO START NEXT WEEK.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.049
I JUST GOT JUDGE HILDRED
TO GRANT A CONTINUANCE.

04:27.049 --> 04:31.140
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME THREE MONTHS
JUST TO LEARN THE FILE.GO. TAKE VAN PELT.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.055
[Cho] ALL RIGHT.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.456
[ship horn blowing]

04:53.293 --> 04:55.033
THERE HE IS.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.558
MR. DRABER!

05:08.743 --> 05:10.962
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:14.183 --> 05:16.925
SO HOW ARE YOU GETTING
ALONG LATELY? ANY PROBLEMS?

05:18.927 --> 05:22.060
YOU...

05:22.060 --> 05:26.282
MY WIFE IS DEAD, AND YOU'RE
WASTING YOUR TIME ON ME?

05:26.282 --> 05:28.763
MR. FLOWER,

05:28.763 --> 05:30.721
I KNEW YOUR WIFE.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.942
NOW WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS, EVEN IF IT'S YOU.

05:33.942 --> 05:37.119
YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:37.119 --> 05:39.556
SO HOW WERE YOU TWO
GETTING ALONG?

05:39.556 --> 05:41.515
[voice breaking]
WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.778
EVERYTHING WAS GOOD.

05:43.778 --> 05:47.085
HOW WAS THE REMODEL?
THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.131
THINGS WERE GOOD.

05:49.131 --> 05:52.221
BUT THAT DAY, WE FOUGHT.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.876
THAT'S WHY I WENT
TO THE MOVIES--

05:54.876 --> 05:56.747
OVER HER HOURS. IT...

05:56.747 --> 06:00.055
[exhales]
IT WAS JUST SO STUPID.

06:00.055 --> 06:03.058
SHE WAS SO STRESSED OVER
THAT DRABER CASE, YOU KNOW?

06:03.058 --> 06:05.408
SHE CALLED IT
HER "CAREER-MAKER."

06:05.408 --> 06:07.932
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID--
"CAREER-MAKER."

06:07.932 --> 06:10.152
SO YOU ARGUED.
DID IT TURN PHYSICAL?

06:10.152 --> 06:13.460
NO. I LOVED HER.

06:13.460 --> 06:17.115
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT. NEVER.[door creaks open]

06:17.115 --> 06:19.988
MR. FLOWER?

06:19.988 --> 06:22.207
I GOT THE TARP ON THE ROOF

06:22.207 --> 06:25.297
IN CASE IT RAINS
BEFORE YOU WANT ME BACK.

06:25.297 --> 06:28.823
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR NOW.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.391
THANK YOU. THAT'S
OUR CONTRACTOR CALE SYLVAN.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.088
HE'S, UH--PATRICK JANE.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.831
HOW YOU DOING?GOOD. YOU'RE STANDING
IN THE...

06:40.922 --> 06:44.229
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
UH, WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

06:44.229 --> 06:46.449
A FLASH HOT WATER HEATER
OVER A REGULAR ONE?

06:46.449 --> 06:49.409
I MEAN, I WAS LEANING
TOWARDS FLASH,

06:49.409 --> 06:53.325
BUT THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE.WELL, YOU KNOW, FLASH WILL PAY
FOR ITSELF IN ENERGY SAVINGS

06:53.325 --> 06:57.504
PRETTY QUICK,
BUT IT DEPENDS ON CONSUMPTION.OF COURSE.
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.897
UM, DO YOU HAVE A CARD?SURE.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.899
GREAT.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.772
I'LL MAYBE GIVE YOU A CALL.GREAT.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.862
WELL, THANKS FOR
YOUR TIME, MR. FLOWER.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.128
THANK YOU.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.130
CALE SYLVAN IS
A DANGEROUS PSYCHOPATH,

07:15.130 --> 07:18.263
AND HE KILLED KELLY FLOWER.OH? HOW'S THAT?

07:18.263 --> 07:20.614
HE HAD ACCESS,
AND HE LOOKED EVIL.AND...

07:20.614 --> 07:23.094
WHEN I TOLD HIM HE WAS
STANDING IN HER BLOOD,

07:23.094 --> 07:25.706
WHAT WAS HIS REACTION?
NOT HORROR. NOT EMBARRASSMENT.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.012
NO EMOTION AT ALL.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL RUN HIM.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.493
EXCELLENT. HAVING PRINTS
MIGHT HELP, NO?

07:30.493 --> 07:33.235
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.237
YOU ALMOST GOT YOURSELVES SHOT.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.239
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU LOOK LIKE COPS.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.720
WE COULD TAKE YOU IN,
BUT YOU'LL LAWYER UP,

07:39.720 --> 07:42.287
AND WE'LL ALL WASTE
A LOT OF TIME.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.116
BUT HERE WE CAN HAVE
A NICE CONVERSATION, RIGHT?YEAH. THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.858
FINE. KELLY FLOWER WAS ALL SET
TO FRY YOUR ASS IN COURT.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.992
YOU WERE LOOKING
AT 20 YEARS, EASY.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.429
NOW THE TRIAL'S BEEN POSTPONED
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.867
THAT GIVES YOU MOTIVE
FOR HER MURDER.OH! THAT ONE'S A WINNER.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.130
I KNOW IT IS. [grunts]

07:59.130 --> 08:01.176
HERE YOU GO.
YOU LIKE THE LOTTO, HUH?

08:01.176 --> 08:04.092
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. MOM.COME ON.

08:04.092 --> 08:07.051
YOU HAVE PRETTY HAIR.

08:07.051 --> 08:10.185
MY MOM'S A LITTLE SENILE.NOW WHO'D TAKE CARE
OF YOUR MOTHER

08:10.185 --> 08:12.187
IF KELLY FLOWER
PUT YOU IN JAIL?

08:12.187 --> 08:15.103
YOU KNOW, KILLING A PROSECUTOR
IS--IS ALMOST AS BAD

08:15.103 --> 08:17.192
AS KILLING A COP, RIGHT?

08:17.192 --> 08:20.674
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO
GET MY HANDS DIRTY WITH.

08:20.674 --> 08:24.416
I GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS
AS IT IS. RIGHT, MOM?CLOSE YOUR MOUTH, MUFFIN.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.554
WELL, JANE'S RIGHT.
SYLVAN IS A KILLER.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.948
OH! YOU KNOW,
IT FEELS GOOD TO BE RIGHT.

08:37.168 --> 08:41.172
PRINTS BROUGHT UP THESE I.D.s.
WE GOT CARL SENNETT,

08:41.172 --> 08:43.174
A WITNESS IN AN ACCIDENTAL
DROWNING IN ARIZONA,

08:43.174 --> 08:45.655
CORY SAMPSON,
WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR

08:45.655 --> 08:47.962
TO A HIT-AND-RUN VICTIM
IN SEATTLE,

08:47.962 --> 08:50.007
AND CHAD SEWELL,
WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

08:50.007 --> 08:53.141
ABOUT THE MURDER OF HIS BOSS,
A BANK EXECUTIVE IN RENO.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.274
WE HAVE FOUR OTHER DEATHS
THAT SYLVAN'S LINKED TO

08:56.274 --> 08:58.886
IN SOME OTHER WAY.HE'S NOT JUST A KILLER.
HE'S A SERIAL KILLER.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.889
WELL, SADDLE UP.
LOCK AND LOAD. DO WHAT YOU DO.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.021
GO--GO BRING HIM IN.WE CAN'T.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.849
NOPE.WHAT?

09:05.849 --> 09:08.243
ALL WE HAVE IS THAT CALE SYLVAN
LIKED TO CHANGE HIS NAME--

09:08.243 --> 09:11.333
NOT ILLEGAL--AND THAT
BAD LUCK FOLLOWED HIM.

09:11.333 --> 09:16.120
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A SEARCH WARRANT.HE'LL KILL AGAIN. YOU--
YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS, LISBON.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.558
KNOWING ISN'T PROVING.
RIGSBY, HAVE CHO SET UP

09:18.558 --> 09:21.082
ON SYLVAN'S HOUSE
24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.693
IF HE SHOWS UP, HAVE CHO FOLLOW
HIM. MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY.OKAY.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.870
THIS--THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I...

09:26.870 --> 09:29.003
I KNOW.I'M GONNA GO WITH CHO. CHO!

09:29.003 --> 09:30.308
GO.

09:32.484 --> 09:35.009
SYLVAN'S SMART ENOUGH
TO KNOW WE'LL BE HERE.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.098
HE WON'T BE COMING BACK.

09:37.098 --> 09:40.014
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.712
YEP.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.499
WHAT ARE YOU READING
THERE, CHO?"WUTHERING HEIGHTS."

09:49.676 --> 09:52.417
WELL,
I'M GONNA TAKE A STROLL.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.467
LET ME KNOW HOW IT ENDS.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.165
NOT WELL.

10:01.165 --> 10:06.040
[knocks on door]CHO SAID JANE DITCHED HIM
AT SYLVAN'S. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.912
NOPE. THERE'S SOMETHING HINKY
HERE, BOSS.

10:08.912 --> 10:12.655
THESE ARE PHOTOS OF SOME OF
THE VICTIMS LINKED TO SYLVAN.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.266
DIFFERENT AGES,
SEXES, RACES.EXACTLY.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.792
A SERIAL KILLER ALMOST ALWAYS
HUNTS THE SAME KIND OF PREY.

10:18.792 --> 10:23.100
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
AS A SERIAL KILLER'S M.O.IT DOES WHEN YOU LOOK
AT SYLVAN'S FINANCIALS.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.929
I TRACKED BANK RECORDS FOR
ALL THE I.D.s WE COULD FIND.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.802
SYLVAN RECEIVED
SUBSTANTIAL PAYMENTS

10:28.802 --> 10:32.153
JUST BEFORE
AND JUST AFTER EACH DEATH.HE KILLS FOR MONEY?
HE'S A HIT MAN?

10:32.153 --> 10:34.242
A PSYCHOPATH WHO MADE MONEY
FROM HIS HOBBY.

10:34.242 --> 10:37.854
IT'S OUTSTANDING.
YOU DO SOMETHING YOU LOVE.

10:37.854 --> 10:41.205
YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORK
A DAY IN YOUR LIFE.WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:41.205 --> 10:45.340
ME? OH, I'VE BEEN AROUND.I FOUND A WEB SITE REGISTERED
TO ONE OF HIS OLD IDENTITIES.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.559
IT SAYS TO "CALL MR. BLACK
FOR ODD JOBS OF ANY SORT."

10:47.559 --> 10:50.040
WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD GIVE HIM A CALL.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.389
UH. GRACE, DO YOU HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS

10:51.389 --> 10:54.654
OF, UH, YOU KNOW,
EX-BOYFRIENDS?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.310
I WANT YOU TO KILL HIM.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.878
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE?

11:03.401 --> 11:05.142
ASK HIM AGAIN, GRACE.

11:05.142 --> 11:09.059
YOU'RE A BUSY LADY.
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT.

11:09.059 --> 11:12.541
YOU GONNA ANSWER ME OR NOT?
I WANT THE BASTARD DEAD--SOON.OOH. SHE'S CONVINCING.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.718
SHH. TRYING TO WORK HERE.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.198
OKAY.

11:17.198 --> 11:20.201
I CHARGE $50,000.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.725
AND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
IS PRETTY EASY.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.727
I MEAN,
YOU JUST GOTTA HAVE

11:24.727 --> 11:27.382
TO STOP THINKING OF HIM
AS A PERSON.

11:27.382 --> 11:31.908
THE REST IS JUST A PHYSICS
PROBLEM--GRAVITY, FORCE, TORQUE.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.954
ASK FOR PROOF OF WHAT HE DOES.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.999
TORQUE IS WELL AND GOOD,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.523
BUT I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE FOR REAL.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.700

LISTEN. LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.764
ARE YOU A COP?

12:01.764 --> 12:03.897
I'M NOT A COP.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.594
NO?

12:05.594 --> 12:08.075
I'M JUST CAREFUL,

12:08.075 --> 12:10.033
UH-HUH.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.079

THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT MAN.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.037
BESIDES, DON'T YOU WANT
TO SHOW ME...

12:14.037 --> 12:15.604
BESIDES,

12:15.604 --> 12:18.041
DON'T YOU WANT TO SHOW ME,

12:18.041 --> 12:20.696
SO YOU CAN MAKE ME AFRAID?

12:20.696 --> 12:23.960
THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE,
ISN'T IT--

12:23.960 --> 12:26.920
SEEING THE FEAR?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.705
YOU SHOW ME YOURS,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU MINE.

12:38.366 --> 12:41.021
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU THEN.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.810
JUST WATCH FOR A SECOND. [Kelly shouts indistinctly]

12:47.810 --> 12:50.421
OH, WAIT. OH, PLEASE!

12:50.421 --> 12:54.121
LOOK AT IT.
IT'S MY LAST JOB. PLEASE!

12:54.121 --> 12:56.514
[muffled gunshot] AAH!

12:56.514 --> 12:59.691
THE CLIENT WAS VERY HAPPY.PROOF. THAT'S PROOF.
PROOF.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.781
ARE WE GONNA DO BUSINESS?

13:01.781 --> 13:05.045
YES, WE ARE.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.960
CBI![Lisbon] DROP THE KNIFE!

13:06.960 --> 13:08.788

13:08.788 --> 13:11.138

13:11.138 --> 13:15.925
ON YOUR KNEES!CALE SYLVAN, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF KELLY FLOWER.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.014
[police radio chatter]

13:18.014 --> 13:21.148
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

13:21.148 --> 13:23.933
JANE, YOU CAN COME OUT.[Patrick] OKAY.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.066
HOW'D YOU KNOW HE HAD PROOF?

13:26.066 --> 13:29.112
WELL, HE'S A NARCISSIST.
NEEDS AFFIRMATION, TROPHIES.

13:29.112 --> 13:32.594
WHO PAID YOU TO KILL KELLY?

13:32.594 --> 13:36.250
TELL 'EM.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO MY LAWYER.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.600
[police radio chatter]

13:38.600 --> 13:41.690
AND I'LL SEE
YOU CLOWNS IN COURT.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.608
CATCHING KILLERS I ENJOY,

13:46.608 --> 13:48.610
BUT BEING REMINDED
THAT WE'RE JUST A COG

13:48.610 --> 13:50.960
IN A PETTY, FASCIST MACHINE--
THAT IS A LITTLE DEPRESSING.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.962
CRIME-FIGHTING IS HARD.
SUCK IT UP.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.921
IF YOU WEREN'T
ON THE WITNESS LIST,

13:54.921 --> 13:56.966
I WOULDN'T EVEN LET YOU

13:56.966 --> 13:59.055
IN THE SAME TIME ZONE
AS JUDGE DREAD.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.145
"JUDGE DREAD"--CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE AS MUCH FUN AS IT SOUNDS.

14:02.145 --> 14:06.976
[Sylvan speaks indistinctly] OH, PLEASE! PLEASE!

14:06.976 --> 14:11.589
WHAT DO YOU WANT? OH, GOD!
OH, GOD, DON'T HURT ME!

14:11.589 --> 14:14.288
OH, GOD! OH, GOD, DON'T!

14:14.288 --> 14:17.030
PLEASE! PLEASE! OHH! [muffled shot fires]

14:17.030 --> 14:19.554
YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.426
THIS VIDEO IS INFLAMMATORY
AND PREJUDICIAL.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.907
ALTHOUGH WE'LL STIPULATE
TO THE FACT

14:24.907 --> 14:27.910
THAT KELLY FLOWER WAS MURDERED,
WE RESERVE OUR RIGHT TO DENY

14:27.910 --> 14:31.479
THAT THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE
MY CLIENT COMMITTED SAID MURDER.

14:31.479 --> 14:35.004
AND WE ALSO OBJECT TO THE CHAIN
OF CUSTODY FOR THIS VIDEO.WOW. IS THAT EVEN A SENTENCE?

14:35.004 --> 14:38.094
QUIET IN THE GALLERY!

14:38.094 --> 14:42.577
YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD,
AND YOU'LL REGRET IT.WELL, I'M--I'M SORRY,
YOUR HONOR, BUT THIS WOMAN

14:42.577 --> 14:45.232
IS SPOUTING NOTHING
BUT LUDICROUS PETTIFOGGERY,

14:45.232 --> 14:48.017
AND, UH, I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.YOUR HONOR, IF YOU'LL LET ME
DOWN, I CAN HANDLE HIM.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.802
MR. JANE--
THAT IS YOUR NAME, CORRECT?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.979
THAT'S CORRECT. PATRICK JANE.

14:52.979 --> 14:56.983
WELL, THIS COURT HEREBY FINES
YOU $1,000.MAKE IT $2,000,

14:56.983 --> 14:59.333
AND LET ME TELL THIS, UH,
TIRESOME WOMAN TO MOVE IT ALONG.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
$2,000 THEN.OKAY.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.077
COUNSELOR, YOU HEARD THE MAN.
MOVE IT ALONG.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.688
SO, AGENT LISBON,

15:06.688 --> 15:08.516
LET'S GET BACK TO THIS VIDEO.

15:08.516 --> 15:12.520
THAT NIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'D EVER SEEN IT?YES.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.740
ARE YOU SURE?OBJECTION.
ASKED AND ANSWERED.

15:15.740 --> 15:19.483
I'LL MOVE ON, YOUR HONOR.
SO YOU NEVER ENTERED

15:19.483 --> 15:22.791
MR. SYLVAN'S APARTMENT
AND LOOKED AT THE VIDEO

15:22.791 --> 15:26.099
ON HIS COMPUTER OR INSTRUCTED
ANYONE ELSE TO DO SO?NO.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.579
WELL, THEN I NEED YOU TO ANSWER
A PUZZLING QUESTION.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.278
YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE
TO ENTER THIS INTO EVIDENCE

15:31.278 --> 15:34.020
AS DEFENSE EXHIBIT ONE.

15:34.020 --> 15:34.977
UH-OH.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.505
I GOT THIS MUG
FROM MR. SYLVAN'S SINK.

15:41.505 --> 15:45.161
BUT HE DIDN'T PUT IT THERE.SO...

15:45.161 --> 15:49.078
SO TELL ME,
HOW IS IT THAT THIS MUG

15:49.078 --> 15:52.038
HAS MR. JANE'S
FINGERPRINTS ON IT?

15:52.038 --> 15:55.519
AGENT LISBON,

15:55.519 --> 15:58.653
DID YOUR CONSULTANT
BREAK INTO MR. SYLVAN'S HOME

15:58.653 --> 16:01.961
WITHOUT A WARRANT?NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.355
YOUR HONOR, MAY I HAVE A MOMENT
TO CONFER WITH AGENT LISBON?

16:05.355 --> 16:08.924
YOU MAKE IT QUICK.
THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.970
BAILIFF.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.975
[whispering] THAT'S HOW
YOU KNEW SYLVAN HAD PROOF.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.847
YOU'D ALREADY SEEN IT.[whispering] I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.110
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED NOW.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.112
[lowers voice]
I WAS WITH CHO.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.114
WE WERE STAKING OUT
SYLVAN'S PLACE.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.551
I DECIDED I WANTED
TO TAKE A WALK.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.424
I HAPPENED UPON SYLVAN'S DOOR,
UNLOCKED.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.948
AND LIKE
ANY CONCERNED CITIZEN,

16:32.948 --> 16:35.472
I WENT IN TO LOOK AROUND

16:35.472 --> 16:39.302
AND CHECKED THAT THE PLACE
HADN'T BEEN ROBBED.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.918
THEN I LEFT.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.398
THAT'S IT.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.965
OH, CRAP.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.576
WHAT'S THE STORY,
MR. ODENTHAL?

16:52.576 --> 16:54.578
YOUR HONOR... [clears throat]

16:54.578 --> 16:56.406
MR. JANE DID ENTER
MR. SYLVAN'S RESIDENCE,

16:56.406 --> 16:59.931
BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE FEARED
THERE WAS AN INTRUDER INSIDE.

16:59.931 --> 17:04.240
YOU MEAN ONE BESIDES HIMSELF?I-IT'S NOT LIKE
I TOOK ANYTHING, YOUR HONOR.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.896
YOUR HONOR,
WHAT MR. JANE IS TRYING TO SAY

17:07.896 --> 17:11.160
IS THAT HE'S NOT A STATE AGENT.
HE'S A PRIVATE CONSULTANT.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.423
THEREFORE, THERE'S NO
FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION.

17:13.423 --> 17:17.165
MR. JANE IS A CHARLATAN
WHO HAS MADE A MOCKERY

17:17.165 --> 17:19.080
OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.128
IN FACT, A FEW MONTHS AGO
HE REFUSED TO TAKE A WOMAN

17:23.128 --> 17:28.002
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR POISONING
UNTIL SHE CONFESSED TO A MURDER.SHE WAS NOT POISONED
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

17:28.002 --> 17:30.919
AND IT WAS JUST
A VERY CLEVER RUSE--QUIET, MR. JANE.

17:30.919 --> 17:34.096
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF ANYWAY.

17:34.096 --> 17:38.318
YOU, TOO, AGENT LISBON.
YOU'RE THE LAW.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.451
I HOLD MR. JANE'S SEARCH
TO BE ILLEGAL,

17:41.451 --> 17:44.237
AND ANY EVIDENCE DISCOVERED
THEN OR DURING THE STING

17:44.237 --> 17:47.979
IS HEREBY EXCLUDED AS FRUIT
OF THE POISONOUS TREE.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.851
THE VIDEO--OUT.

17:49.851 --> 17:53.159
ANY STATEMENTS
MADE BY THE DEFENDANT

17:53.159 --> 17:56.684
TO AGENT VAN PELT--OUT.YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT.
YOUR ANGER IS CLOUDING YOUR--

17:56.684 --> 17:59.730
MR. ODENTHAL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND

17:59.730 --> 18:04.126
THAT YOUR CONSULTANT
HASN'T CRAPPED ALL OVER?

18:04.126 --> 18:06.476
[sighs]

18:06.476 --> 18:08.261
NO, YOUR HONOR.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.915
WELL,
THEN THE PEOPLE v. SYLVAN

18:10.915 --> 18:12.917
IS HEREBY DISMISSED
FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.224
MR. SYLVAN,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.[bang]

18:17.879 --> 18:20.099
THIS IS RIDICULOUS,
YOUR HONOR.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.884
THIS IS WRONG!
THIS DON'T MAKE NO SENSE!

18:22.884 --> 18:26.583
I'LL BE SEEING YOU.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.325
HE KILLED MY WIFE!

18:29.325 --> 18:31.066
HOW CAN HE GO FREE?

18:31.066 --> 18:33.590
[Judge Hildred] BAILIFF,
BRING IN THE NEXT CASE.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.293
I HAD A CONFESSION.
I HAD VIDEO.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.251
I HAD AN AIRTIGHT CASE.

18:42.251 --> 18:46.299
AND IT'S ALL OUT.

18:46.299 --> 18:50.390
HOW COULD YOU BREAK
INTO HIS PLACE?EASY. THE LOCK ON THE BACK DOOR
WAS VERY FLIMSY.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.480
MARC, I APOLOGIZE. I DO. I--ALSO, I DIDN'T THINK
I'D BE FOUND OUT.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.352
I MEAN, HOW WAS I TO KNOW
THEY WERE GOING TO DUST

18:56.352 --> 18:58.789
FOR MYFINGERPRINTS?YOU LET A KILLER
BACK ON THE STREETS.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.140
ACTUALLY, I GOT THE KILLER
OFF THE STREETS.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.317
KEEPING HIM OFF THE STREETS--
YOUR JOB.YOU'RE BLAMING ME?

19:04.317 --> 19:08.190
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO GOT
THE MURDER WEAPON TOSSED.COURT IS THEATER. WHATEVER SIDE
HAS THE BEST LIAR WINS.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.453
USUALLY THAT'S YOU,
BUT TODAY SHE WAS BETTER.

19:10.453 --> 19:14.544
YOU'RE AN ARROGANT
LITTLE BASTARD.WHOA, EASY WITH THE STEEL,
BROTHER.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.459
OH, RELAX. IT'S NOT LOADED.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.722
LOOK, MARC, THERE IS
NO DOUBLE JEOPARDY HERE.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.551
WE CAN STILL
TAKE THIS TO TRIAL.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.510
I WILL FIND NEW EVIDENCE.
I PROMISE.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.860
YOU'RE A MENACE.

19:25.860 --> 19:29.255
WHEN I'M D.A., YOU'LL NEVER
WORK WITH THIS OFFICE AGAIN.

19:29.255 --> 19:32.606
SO AMBITIOUS.NOT YOUR CALL, MARC.
NOT THEN, NOT NOW.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.477
YOU'RE DEFENDING HIM?THANK YOU, LISBON.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.175
SHUT UP, JANE.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
TRUSTED EACH OTHER.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.397
SO DID I.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.138
WE DO. I--WE HAVE TRUST.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.749
I-I DIDN'T TELL HER
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HER

19:45.749 --> 19:48.448
TO BE COMPLICIT AND THEN
HAVE TO LIE ABOUT IT LATER.

19:48.448 --> 19:52.234
SOME PARTNERSHIP
YOU GOT GOING ON HERE.

19:54.976 --> 19:58.022
I'LL HAVE TO SEND YOU HOME WHILE
THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS UNIT

19:58.022 --> 20:01.852
DOES ITS THING--
FIVE DAYS AT LEAST.WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.203
THAT WILL BE THE P.S.U.'s
DETERMINATION, NO DOUBT.

20:06.292 --> 20:09.382
THIS IS JUST THE SITUATION
WE TALKED ABOUT, PATRICK.

20:09.382 --> 20:12.994
AGENT LISBON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ACTIONS OF HER TEAM MEMBERS,

20:12.994 --> 20:14.387
INCLUDING YOU.

20:14.387 --> 20:17.085
YES, MA'AM.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.479
IS THAT ALL?YES.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.310
[lowers voice] LOOK,
LISBON, I'M SO SORRY.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.659
I REALLY AM.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.574
JANE.

20:35.321 --> 20:38.193
LISBON NEEDS SOME TIME OFF.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.935
A FEW DAYS OFF
WILL DO HER GOOD.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.418
NICE TALKING WITH YOU.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.248
YEAH.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.952
RIGSBY, GO BACK THROUGH
SYLVAN'S FINANCIALS.

20:57.952 --> 21:01.260
VAN PELT, TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT KELLY'S VIDEO OF HER MURDER.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.131
SEE IF WE MISSED ANYTHING.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.133
HEY, WE'LL SERVE UP SYLVAN

21:05.133 --> 21:07.527
AS YOUR WELCOME BACK PRESENT,

21:10.791 --> 21:13.794
OOH. IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY
IN HERE.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.276
DO YOU WANT TO GO
GET A COFFEE?

21:19.539 --> 21:21.280
OH, COME ON.
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.891

21:23.891 --> 21:26.894
CHO, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.
HE'S YOUR PROBLEM NOW.

21:26.894 --> 21:30.158
THAT'S GOOD. CHO'S A BIG BOY.
HE KNOWS HOW TO LOOK AFTER ME.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.292
YOU WANT TO GET A COFFEE?

21:35.206 --> 21:37.992
DID YOU BRING A BOOK?

21:37.992 --> 21:39.994
COULD BE A BIT OF A WAIT.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.996
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

21:41.996 --> 21:44.564
YOU'RE STILL MAD WITH ME
ABOUT LISBON'S SUSPENSION.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.914
YEAH. IT'S YOUR FAULT.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.656
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
MURDERERS TAKE RISKS.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.311
SOMETIMES IN ORDER
TO CATCH THESE RISK TAKERS,

21:52.311 --> 21:56.227
WE HAVE TO TAKE RISKS.
THERE CAN BE FALLOUT.TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON
OR I'M OUTTA HERE.

21:56.227 --> 22:00.406
[lowers voice] OKAY. I LOOKED
IN SYLVAN'S KITCHEN CABINETS.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.843
NOT MUCH OF A TEA SELECTION.
HE'S A COFFEE GEEK--

22:02.843 --> 22:05.367
DRINKS ONLY THE BEST,
FRESH-ROAST COFFEE.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.761
AND THE BEST
FRESH-ROASTED COFFEE

22:07.761 --> 22:11.852
IN SYLVAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD...IS IN THIS PLACE HERE.
THAT'S KIND OF THIN.

22:11.852 --> 22:15.856
YEAH, BUT I'M 100%
CONFIDENT THAT IT...[door bells jingle]

22:17.553 --> 22:20.208
THANK GOODNESS.

22:20.208 --> 22:23.603
[lowers voice] LOOK,
THE JUDGE WARNED US NOT TO TALK

22:23.603 --> 22:26.301
TO SYLVAN WITHOUT HIS LAWYER.TALK? THIS IS TWO GUYS
BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER

22:26.301 --> 22:29.086
IN THE COFFEE LINE.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.785
JANE.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.360
CALE?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.535
OH!

22:42.535 --> 22:44.754
THAT'S A FUNNY COINCIDENCE.

22:44.754 --> 22:48.323
I TOLD YOU
I'D BE SEEING YOU.

NO BADGE, NO AUTHORITY.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.687
[sighs]

34:44.690 --> 34:46.693
OH, THANKS
FOR BAILING ME OUT.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.695
LISBON WASN'T ANSWERING
HER PHONE FOR SOME REASON.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.349
THE JUDGE IS REALLY PISSED,
SO IS ODENTHAL.

34:50.349 --> 34:53.047
THEY WANT TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE.EH.

34:53.047 --> 34:57.530
IT'S NOT JUST CONTEMPT OF COURT,
JANE. IT'S BATTERY.BATTERY AGAINST
A PEACE OFFICER.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.488
PENAL CODE SECTION 242
"ET SEQ."

34:59.488 --> 35:01.055
I LOVE THE LATIN.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.666
YOU KNOW THERE'S 30 KINDS
OF BATTERY CHARGES?

35:03.666 --> 35:04.711
YES.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.757
THIS STUFF IS FASCINATING.

35:07.757 --> 35:10.412
YOU KNOW,
I COULD BE MY OWN LAWYER.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.501
YOU'RE GONNA REPRESENT
YOURSELF?

35:12.501 --> 35:15.504
YOU REPRESENT YOURSELF,
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.UH, IT'S ACTUALLY

35:15.504 --> 35:18.290
"HE WHO IS HIS OWN LAWYER
HAS A FOOL FOR A CLIENT."

35:18.290 --> 35:20.466
IT'S MUCH CATCHIER.

35:20.466 --> 35:23.773
COULD BE FUN, CHO.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.258
THIS MAY BE A, UM,

35:30.258 --> 35:32.304
A SOMEWHAT INFORMAL HEARING,

35:32.304 --> 35:35.698
BUT YOU STILL MUST RESPECT
THIS COURT,

35:35.698 --> 35:39.006
OR YOU WILL GO DIRECTLY
BACK TO JAIL. DO YOU READ ME?

35:39.006 --> 35:40.921
YEAH, YOU BET, YOUR HONOR.

35:40.921 --> 35:44.751
MR. JANE ASKED ME TO COME.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

35:44.751 --> 35:46.579
I HAVE NO IDEA.

35:46.579 --> 35:49.886
LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT, MR. JANE.
IS IT TRUE THAT YESTERDAY,

35:49.886 --> 35:54.413
YOU TWEAKED THE ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S NOSE

35:54.413 --> 35:56.284
IN THIS VERY ROOM?

35:56.284 --> 35:57.851
[laughs]

35:57.851 --> 36:00.114
SPEAKING OF YOURSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON, MARC,

36:00.114 --> 36:03.161
Y-YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
SOUNDS A LITTLE SILLY.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.424
YES, I TWEAKED YOUR NOSE.

36:05.424 --> 36:07.904
YOUR HONOR, WE'RE DONE HERE.
MR. JANE ADMITS THE CRIME.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.472
BUT IN MY DEFENSE,
YOU WERE BEING VERY ANNOYING.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.693
MR. JANE,
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.[imitating Al Pacino]
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

36:13.693 --> 36:17.958
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.
THIS WHOLE TRIAL'S OUT OF ORDER![sighs]

36:19.742 --> 36:21.527
[normal voice] OH, COME ON.

36:21.527 --> 36:24.138
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
YOU WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT ONE.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.748
[chuckles]

36:25.748 --> 36:27.663
OKAY.

36:27.663 --> 36:30.318
ALL RIGHT,
MY TURN TO QUESTION YOU GUYS.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.711
YES. WAIT.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.582
"YOU GUYS"? PLURAL?

36:33.582 --> 36:35.410
WELL, YOU'RE BOTH WITNESSES.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.544
UH... WHEN I'M
CROSS-EXAMINING MYSELF,

36:38.544 --> 36:41.590
DO--DO I HAVE TO STAND DOWN
THERE AND ASK THE QUESTIONS

36:41.590 --> 36:45.333
AND RUN BACK UP HERE
AND ANSWER THEM?MR. JANE, YOU STAY PUT.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.639
OKAY.

36:46.639 --> 36:49.511
MR. ODENTHAL,
YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

36:49.511 --> 36:52.601
PRO PERDEFENDANTS ARE GIVENA CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LATITUDE.

36:52.601 --> 36:55.778
YOU KNOW THAT.
GOD HELP US ALL.

36:55.778 --> 36:58.738
JUDGE HILDRED, ARE YOU NOW
OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

36:58.738 --> 37:01.262
A MEMBER
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY? WHAT?NO!

37:01.262 --> 37:03.438
MR. ODENTHAL, DO YOU OWN A GUN?

37:03.438 --> 37:06.485
WAIT. WHAT?ARE YOU A GOOD SHOT?
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

37:06.485 --> 37:09.444
HOW ABOUT YOU, YOUR HONOR?
YOU ANY GOOD WITH A GUN?

37:09.444 --> 37:11.490
THE PERSON
THAT KILLED CALE SYLVAN,

37:11.490 --> 37:13.318
THEY ESTIMATED,
WAS MORE THAN 200 YARDS AWAY.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.581
THAT IS A GREAT SHOT.

37:15.581 --> 37:19.585
IT'S WHY WE ASSUME THERE WAS
A SECOND HIT MAN.MR. JANE, PLEASE SIT DOWN.

37:19.585 --> 37:23.153
WERE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH KELLY FLOWER?NO.

37:23.153 --> 37:26.505
BUT ISN'T IT TRUE
THAT YOU DELIGHT

37:26.505 --> 37:29.421
IN KILLING SMALL FURRY ANIMALS?
YOU'RE A HUNTER.THIS IS IRRELEVANT.

37:29.421 --> 37:32.206
OH. THIS IS
HOW WE SOLVE A MURDER.

37:32.206 --> 37:35.253
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO SOLVE A MURDER?OF COURSE I DO.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.298
THEN ANSWER THE QUESTION, SIR.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.300
ANSWER IT,
OR TELL ME WHY YOU WON'T.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.477
I GO DUCK HUNTING
EVERY SEASON.

37:42.477 --> 37:46.438
AND WHAT KIND OF GUN DO YOU USE
TO KILL THESE DEFENSELESS DUCKS?

37:46.438 --> 37:49.267
[sighs] A 10-GAUGE SHOTGUN.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.270
AND WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF
A VERY GOOD MARKSMAN?

37:52.270 --> 37:56.361
UH, LAST SEASON I BAGGED
A MALLARD AT, UH, 60 YARDS.

37:56.361 --> 37:59.233
OH, THAT'S NOT BAD.
NOT--NOT BAD AT ALL.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.888
10-GAUGE, 3-INCH SHELL.
3 INCHES OF HELL.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.542
3 INCHES OF DEATH.

38:03.542 --> 38:04.934
3 1/2.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.070
I MEAN, I THINK.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.593
RIGHT?

38:11.593 --> 38:14.379
SO YOU MUST BE A HUNTER, TOO.NO. I...

38:14.379 --> 38:16.555
THEN WHAT'S THAT DEAD BEAST
IN YOUR OFFICE, MARC?

38:16.555 --> 38:18.905
WHAT IS THAT? DID YOU JUST
GET IT OFF craigslist?

38:18.905 --> 38:20.602
WELL, I, UH,

38:20.602 --> 38:23.736
I MEAN, YES, I USED TO HUNT,
JUST NOT ANYMORE.

38:23.736 --> 38:27.479
BUT YOU STILL KNOW YOUR WAY
AROUND A GUN, DON'T YOU?

38:27.479 --> 38:31.483
OH, RELAX. IT'S NOT LOADED.

38:31.483 --> 38:34.268
YOU OWN YOUR OWN RIFLE,
DON'T YOU?

38:36.139 --> 38:38.359
YOU HEARD THAT THE JUDGE
HAD ISSUED A WARRANT

38:38.359 --> 38:40.143
FOR SYLVAN'S MURDER HOUSE,

38:40.143 --> 38:44.539
AND YOU KNEW THAT YOU HAD TO
SILENCE SYLVAN BEFORE HE TALKED.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.632
[Rigsby] CHO, GET DOWN! \ [gunshot]

38:50.632 --> 38:52.504
YOU HAD TO SILENCE HIM

38:52.504 --> 38:56.203
BEFORE HE NAMED YOU
AS HIS CLIENT--

38:56.203 --> 38:58.858
THE CLIENT WHO HIRED HIM
TO KILL KELLY FLOWER.

38:58.858 --> 39:02.731
YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.SO PROVE IT.
LET US SEARCH YOUR HOUSE.

39:02.731 --> 39:06.605
WE DON'T FIND A GUN,
I'LL APOLOGIZE.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.694
LET HIM DO THE SEARCH, MARC.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.522
NO.

39:10.522 --> 39:11.697
NO?

39:11.697 --> 39:15.091
NO.
I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

39:15.091 --> 39:17.659
I HAVE RIGHTS.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.749
AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
PREJUDICED AGAINST ME, JUDGE.

39:20.749 --> 39:23.404
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT UP
WITH THE CHIEF JUDGE.

39:23.404 --> 39:27.539
IN FACT, I'M GOING
TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.YOU SHOULD STAY PUT,
COUNSELOR. BAILIFF.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.105
DON'T MOVE.

39:29.105 --> 39:30.890
[Patrick whistles]

39:30.890 --> 39:33.240
THE GUN THAT KILLED SYLVAN--

39:33.240 --> 39:35.634
A REMINGTON 700, WITH SCOPE,
FROM YOUR GARAGE.

39:35.634 --> 39:38.245
OH, AND, UH...

39:38.245 --> 39:42.031
WE GOT A WARRANT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
A LOT BETTER WITH ONE OF THESE.

39:42.031 --> 39:44.817
YOU'RE A GOOD PROSECUTOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.471
A SNIPER RIFLE--

39:46.471 --> 39:48.429
LYING IN WAIT, MURDER
WITH SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

39:48.429 --> 39:50.344
HELLO, DEATH PENALTY.

39:50.344 --> 39:53.129
BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO COME
CLEAN ABOUT KELLY'S MURDER,

39:53.129 --> 39:55.784
THE D.A. WILL TAKE DEATH
OFF THE TABLE.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.178
THAT IS THE LAST
AND ONLY OFFER YOU'LL GET,

39:58.178 --> 40:00.659
YOU MISERABLE SACK OF CRAP.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.661
I REALIZED THE DRABERS
DIDN'T HIRE SYLVAN

40:02.661 --> 40:05.185
WHEN THEY DIDN'T KILL
LISBON AND ME.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.187
IF THEY DON'T KILL COPS,

40:07.187 --> 40:09.537
THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT GONNA KILL
AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.800
BUT THE DRABERS WERE CONNECTED
SOMEHOW, WEREN'T THEY?

40:11.800 --> 40:14.890
'CAUSE THEIR CASE WAS A CAREER
MAKER, ACCORDING TO KELLY,

40:14.890 --> 40:18.111
AND YOU WANTED TO BE D.A.
SOMEDAY.

40:18.111 --> 40:21.593
THE DRABER CASE WOULD HAVE
MADE ME A LOCK FOR D.A.

40:21.593 --> 40:24.639
OH, YEAH.AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME.

40:24.639 --> 40:28.121
I HAD SENIORITY. IT WAS MINE,
AND THE BITCH TOOK IT.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.166
SO YOU HIRED SYLVAN TO KILL HER.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.258
YES.

40:35.258 --> 40:37.260
AND WHEN SYLVAN WAS ARRESTED,

40:37.260 --> 40:39.915
YOU TOLD HIM YOU'D FIX IT,
THAT HE'D WALK.

40:39.915 --> 40:42.570
AS PROSECUTOR,
YOU HAD THAT POWER.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.268
THEN YOU HAD SYLVANTELL
HIS ATTORNEY TO INVESTIGATE ME.

40:45.268 --> 40:49.534
THE WHOLE D.A.'s OFFICE
KNOWS HOW YOU OPERATE.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.623
CRAZINESS.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.625
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A GOOD CHANCE

40:53.625 --> 40:55.801
YOU'D STEPPED OVER
SOME LINE OR OTHER.

40:55.801 --> 40:57.498
TURNED OUT YOU HAD.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.457
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S LEARNED HIS LESSON.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.502
YEAH, I HAVE.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.591
I CERTAINLY HAVE, LISBON.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.333
I WON'T BE STOPPING
FOR TEA AGAIN.

41:06.333 --> 41:10.424
...AND LIGHTS OUT AT 9:30,
AND YOUR SISTER AT 9:00.

41:10.424 --> 41:11.773
NO.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.775
9:30.

41:13.775 --> 41:16.691
I LOVE YOU. BYE.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.693
[hangs up receiver]YOU WANTED TO SEE US, MA'AM?

41:18.693 --> 41:20.782
YEAH. YEAH. SIT.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.657
BEFORE I MAKE
ANY FINAL DECISIONS,

41:25.657 --> 41:28.660
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.662
YOU DISRUPTED A COURTROOM,

41:30.662 --> 41:32.011
ASSAULTED AN OFFICER
OF THE COURT

41:32.011 --> 41:33.621
SO YOU COULD QUESTION HIM

41:33.621 --> 41:36.711
AND NEARLY CAUSED A MISTRIAL
IN AN UNRELATED FELONY CASE.

41:36.711 --> 41:38.800
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY ACCURATE.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.586
YOU IGNORED YOUR SUSPENSION,

41:41.586 --> 41:43.936
CONFRONTED A GANG OF CRIMINALS
WITHOUT ANY BACKUP

41:43.936 --> 41:45.590
AND THEN PARTICIPATED

41:45.590 --> 41:47.766
IN MR. JANE'S DISRUPTIONS,
ASSAULT, ETCETERA?

41:47.766 --> 41:48.984
YES, MA'AM.

41:52.597 --> 41:54.555
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.514
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MA'AM.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.559
THE CBI JUST BUSTED
A CROOKED D.A.,

41:58.559 --> 42:02.737
ROOTED OUT CORRUPTION AND SOLVED
THE MURDER OF ONE OF OUR OWN.AWESOME.

42:02.737 --> 42:04.391
BY THE WAY,

42:04.391 --> 42:07.133
I.C.E. PICKED UP THE DRABERS
AT THE CANADIAN BORDER.

42:07.133 --> 42:11.093
THE D.A. ANNOUNCED
HE'LL TRY THE CASE HIMSELF.

42:11.093 --> 42:13.574
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

42:13.574 --> 42:15.968
I'LL TELL THE P.S.U.
TO TERMINATE YOUR SUSPENSION.

42:15.968 --> 42:18.623
WELCOME BACK.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.322
OH.[snaps fingers]

42:22.322 --> 42:24.629

HE NEEDS A CASHIER'S CHECK.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.727
[blinds rattle]

42:35.727 --> 42:37.903
WELL,
WE CAUGHT THE BAD GUY.

42:37.903 --> 42:40.079
YES, WE DID.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.124
MOST DAYS, THAT'S ENOUGH.

42:42.124 --> 42:45.650
YEP.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.217
YOU, UH,
WANT TO GO TO THE RANGE,

42:48.217 --> 42:50.263

42:50.263 --> 42:51.699
I'LL DRIVE.
