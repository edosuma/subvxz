00:02.234 --> 00:05.670
All right, our next gadget
here on gadget corner

00:05.671 --> 00:08.640
Is a car safety device
known as the snooze no more.

00:08.641 --> 00:09.908
That's right.

00:09.909 --> 00:12.744
Stick this little bad boy
in your ear like this,

00:12.745 --> 00:16.347
Adjust it for your level,
and when you're driving
you won't go to sleep.

00:16.347 --> 00:17.515
<i>(gadget beeps)</i>

00:20.352 --> 00:22.587
It's also good
when aunt agnes stops by

00:22.588 --> 00:24.823
To talk about
her kidney stone operation.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.725
Uh-huh. Was it painful?

00:26.726 --> 00:28.927
<i>(gadget beeps)</i>

00:28.928 --> 00:31.229
Did you save
any of the stones?

00:31.230 --> 00:33.932
<i>(beep)</i>
all right. Next up on...

00:33.933 --> 00:37.235
You can videotape that, watch
the operation backwards.
They put it back in?

00:37.236 --> 00:39.671
<i>(beep)</i>

00:39.672 --> 00:43.008
All right,
I'm sure you'll like...
<i>(beeps)</i>

00:43.009 --> 00:45.576
<i>(continuous beep)</i>

00:49.749 --> 00:51.315
<i>(beep stops)</i>

00:51.316 --> 00:55.419
All right,
our next gadget here on--
<i>(beep resumes)</i>

00:55.420 --> 00:57.455
On gadget corner -

01:01.127 --> 01:03.995
<i>(beep stops)</i>

01:03.996 --> 01:05.997
All right, let's say
your boots are sopping wet

01:05.998 --> 01:07.999
From a rainstorm
at the job site.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.001
Come home,
what are you gonna do?

01:10.002 --> 01:12.070
You go straight to binford's
electric boot dryer.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.472
Let's show how it works.
Heidi, wet boots, please.

01:14.473 --> 01:16.808
These boots have been sitting

01:16.809 --> 01:19.144
In this scalding hot water/
brine solution

01:19.145 --> 01:20.979
For over two days.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.548
Whoo! These babies are wet.

01:23.549 --> 01:24.916
Tim.
Yeah?

01:24.917 --> 01:28.553
Where'd you get those boots?
Out of your locker.

01:28.554 --> 01:32.123
Those are
my dress work boots.
Yeah, a word to the wise, al.

01:32.124 --> 01:34.125
Always lock your locker
on gadget day.

01:34.126 --> 01:36.895
But don't worry. In one minute,
they'll be dry as a bone.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.396
I don't think so.

01:38.397 --> 01:41.465
Binford's electric boot dryer
takes overnight to work.

01:41.466 --> 01:45.837
That's before I gave it
a 5000-watt boost. Watch this.

01:45.838 --> 01:48.039
My boots are smoking!

01:48.040 --> 01:52.276
That's probably
because they're on fire.
Put them in the water, quick!

01:52.277 --> 01:54.979
Oh, well,
now they're all wet a--
ah, jeez.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.083
Now it's time to use
the boot dryer again.

01:58.084 --> 02:00.952
This could be
a very long show at this rate.

02:56.909 --> 02:58.609
Hey, good job, dad.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.278
Thank you, son.

03:11.456 --> 03:14.826
Timihana!

03:14.827 --> 03:16.895
Hello.
How was school?

03:16.896 --> 03:19.764
It was great.
I got my first a.

03:19.765 --> 03:21.032
Cool.

03:21.033 --> 03:24.568
Congratulations.
Well, that goes
on the refrigerator.

03:24.569 --> 03:25.703
No. No, tim.

03:25.704 --> 03:29.140
This is a paper
on abnormal sexuality.

03:30.943 --> 03:33.111
Put it up in the bedroom.

03:33.112 --> 03:37.548
We don't need it.

03:37.549 --> 03:40.785
Not only did I get an a,
I got the highest grade
in the class.

03:40.786 --> 03:44.622
Everybody really is mad at me
because I wrecked the curve.
I love school.

03:44.623 --> 03:48.193
I'm very proud of you.
Your first a.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.594
I'm still waiting for mine.

03:50.595 --> 03:53.564
<i>(phone rings)</i>
I'll get it.

03:53.565 --> 03:54.833
Hello?

03:54.834 --> 03:59.270
Oh, hi, al.
Yeah, he's right here.

03:59.271 --> 04:02.841
Try not to tie up the line.
I'm waiting for a call.
I own the line.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.775
Hi, al. What's up?

04:04.776 --> 04:07.445
Really? That's too bad, al.
It really is.

04:07.446 --> 04:09.948
I know how much
the guy meant to you.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.283
Wow, that's weird.
That really is weird.

04:12.284 --> 04:14.285
No, don't worry about tomorrow.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.286
I got it covered.
I can do it myself.

04:16.288 --> 04:19.156
Ok, take as much time
as you want. Thanks. Bye.

04:19.158 --> 04:23.094
What happened?
Al's favorite
bingo caller died.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.400
Oh, no.

04:29.401 --> 04:31.669
Al said his last words
were, "b-11 and g...

04:31.670 --> 04:34.172
I think I'm having
a heart attack."

04:34.173 --> 04:37.275
Oh, that's awful.

04:37.276 --> 04:41.746
Yeah. Worse than that,
al was one away from bingo.

04:41.747 --> 04:44.949
Dad, since al's not
gonna be there tomorrow,

04:44.950 --> 04:47.952
Do you think maybe
I could be your assistant?

04:47.953 --> 04:50.554
You mean,
you take al's place?
Yeah.

04:50.555 --> 04:54.359
I mean, I know a lot
about tools, and I can say,
"I don't think so, tim."

04:54.360 --> 04:57.228
What about school?

04:57.229 --> 04:59.697
I'd only miss
a couple classes.

04:59.698 --> 05:05.136
It's in the afternoon.
Would you miss important ones?
You know, like shop?

05:05.137 --> 05:07.939
Nah, just history and math.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.541
In that case,
all right, yeah.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.576
All right.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.982
Ok. First thing
is heidi introduces us,

05:17.983 --> 05:21.152
Then we tell 'em
it's craft week,
then we begin the project.

05:21.153 --> 05:24.289
But the best part is
I get to use the scroll saw
all by myself.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.756
No, no, no, no.

05:25.757 --> 05:28.927
Best part is, I get
to work side by side
with my eldest boy.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.428
Tool dad, tool son.

05:30.429 --> 05:32.563
<i>(both)</i> ar-ar-ar-ar-ar.

05:32.564 --> 05:34.098
Now...
<i>(â™ª loud rock)</i>

05:34.099 --> 05:36.100
Hey, hey, hey!

05:36.101 --> 05:38.102
Could you please
turn that junk down?

05:38.103 --> 05:41.105
<i>(turns music off)</i>
it's not junk,
it's heavy metal.

05:41.106 --> 05:43.274
It sounds like
they're banging their heads
on their guitars

05:43.275 --> 05:45.276
While they're getting
their teeth drilled.

05:45.277 --> 05:48.446
Hey, cool.
You saw the video.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.083
Randy, stop bothering us.

05:52.084 --> 05:54.252
We're trying to prepare
for tomorrow's <i>tool time.</i>

05:54.253 --> 05:56.154
What do you mean, "we"?

05:56.155 --> 05:58.622
Al's not gonna be be there.
So I'm gonna be
dad's new assistant.

05:58.623 --> 05:59.924
You?

05:59.925 --> 06:03.061
Yeah, and not only that,
I get to hang out
with heidi.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.796
I'll probably
get her phone number.

06:05.797 --> 06:08.099
Back the hormones up.

06:09.768 --> 06:12.870
I don't want to have to bring
the fire department in
to hose you down.

06:12.871 --> 06:16.074
No big deal for them.
They're usually there anyway.

06:17.809 --> 06:20.345
<i>(siren wailing)</i>

06:27.719 --> 06:30.355
Hey, quit playing
with my basketball.

06:30.356 --> 06:33.757
Why? You're not.
Well, I am now.

06:33.758 --> 06:36.394
So, did you hear
brad's gonna be on <i>tool time?</i>

06:36.395 --> 06:41.866
Yeah, they're doing
a salute to doofuses.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.369
Who'd want to be
on that stupid show anyway?

06:44.370 --> 06:48.439
Well, I would.
Forget about it.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.542
The only one who'll ever
get to be on that show is brad.

06:51.543 --> 06:54.012
Dad picks him
to do everything.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.481
Dad does a lot of things
with me, too.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.383
Oh, shut up.

07:00.185 --> 07:03.554
I don't know. I think dad will
let me be on <i>tool time</i> someday.

07:03.555 --> 07:07.191
Yeah, well,
don't hold your breath.

07:07.192 --> 07:10.161
On second thought,
hold your breath.

07:12.231 --> 07:16.867
We'll be using a number nine
medium-tooth blade
in our scroll saw.

07:16.868 --> 07:19.737
Oh, man,
I'm gonna be awesome.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.007
Hi, brad.

07:23.008 --> 07:26.777
Oh, uh, hi, hodi. Um...

07:26.778 --> 07:29.447
Ho, heidi.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.516
I mean, hi, heidi.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.751
You a little nervous
about being on <i>tool time?</i>

07:33.752 --> 07:36.720
Um... <i>Tool time?</i>

07:36.721 --> 07:39.357
Oh! Oh, yeah. That's it.

07:39.358 --> 07:42.160
There's a trick I use,
calm myself down
before a show.

07:42.161 --> 07:45.063
I just picture everybody
in their underwear.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.169
I don't think
that's gonna work.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.637
You'll be fine.

07:53.638 --> 07:55.606
Almost ready to go,
heidi?
Yeah.

07:55.607 --> 07:59.077
Little nervous?
Use a little trick I use
to calm myself down.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.379
Just picture everybody naked.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.885
Does everybody
know what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

08:07.886 --> 08:10.921
That's right. Now here he is,
the star of the show,
tim "the tool man" taylor!

08:10.922 --> 08:14.825
Whoo-hoo!
<i>(cheering)</i>

08:14.826 --> 08:18.262
Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everybody.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

08:18.263 --> 08:20.264
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,

08:20.265 --> 08:22.300
And we have a special treat
for you today.

08:22.301 --> 08:24.435
Al's not here!

08:24.436 --> 08:26.270
<i>(audience groans)</i>

08:26.271 --> 08:28.506
Hey, pal, sit back down.

08:28.507 --> 08:31.309
Got a special
guest assistant for you.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.312
I want you to give
a big warm <i>tool time</i> welcome

08:34.313 --> 08:37.715
To my oldest boy,
brad "the tool boy" taylor!

08:44.389 --> 08:46.324
Hi, everyone.
<i>(man)</i> hi.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.326
Well, it's craft week
here on <i>tool time,</i>

08:48.327 --> 08:51.395
And we're doing our salute...
<i>(drill whirs)</i>

08:51.396 --> 08:53.164
...To scroll saws.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.501
We're gonna show you how to use
a binford 6100 scroll saw.

08:56.502 --> 08:59.170
Brad, why don't you tell us
what a scroll saw can do?

08:59.171 --> 09:01.539
It's used for cutting out
intricate patterns in wood.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.641
Right. You can also
cut out intricate patterns

09:03.642 --> 09:06.010
In coat racks,
hat racks, pipe racks

09:06.011 --> 09:09.547
Or tyrannosaurus racks.
<i>(roar sound effect)</i>

09:13.585 --> 09:15.819
What manly design
are you cutting out today?

09:15.820 --> 09:18.222
A heart
for my girlfriend ashley.

09:18.223 --> 09:21.792
Can't get much more manly
than that.

09:21.793 --> 09:23.794
Now, I've already
traced my design

09:23.795 --> 09:26.264
Onto a piece
of 3/4-inch clear pine.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.266
Right. Heidi,
the clear pine, please.

09:30.669 --> 09:33.404
Here you go, brad.
Hank you, theidi. Um...

09:35.040 --> 09:37.341
I mean, thank you, heidi.

09:41.713 --> 09:44.081
Could we?

09:44.082 --> 09:46.617
Sorry, dad.
Goggles.

09:46.618 --> 09:49.287
Now, we'll be
using a number nine
medium-tooth blade

09:49.288 --> 09:50.954
In our scroll saw.

09:50.955 --> 09:54.692
Right. Welcome, folks,
to the scroll saw grand prix,

09:54.693 --> 09:56.727
Starring championship driver
brad taylor.

09:56.728 --> 09:59.497
He was in pole position
at his first cut.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.165
Notice how he keeps his fingers
away from the blade,

10:01.166 --> 10:04.168
On the advice of his crew chief
"three fingers" morgan,

10:04.169 --> 10:07.905
A lousy crew chief
but a great bowler.

10:07.906 --> 10:10.408
He's around that corner.
There's no one even near him.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.910
Can he hold the race
till the end? We don't know.

10:12.911 --> 10:15.079
Watch this, for the grand...
<i>(makes engine noises)</i>

10:15.080 --> 10:17.215
Watch out!
The finish line...

10:17.216 --> 10:18.949
Checkered flag!

10:22.621 --> 10:25.623
Good work.
Thanks, dad.

10:25.624 --> 10:29.760
Watching that, I'm thinking
maybe I'll make mom a heart
instead of a pipe rack.

10:29.761 --> 10:31.829
Aren't you gonna
trace your design first?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.265
Son, you been scrolling
as long as I have,

10:34.266 --> 10:36.334
You don't need
to waste time tracing.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.769
I want you
to be my commentator.
All right.

10:38.770 --> 10:43.407
Welcome to the scroll saw 500.
Tim taylor's at the wheel.

10:43.408 --> 10:47.845
Uh-oh! All the other scrollers
are leaving the track!

10:47.846 --> 10:50.848
They're afraid for their lives!

10:50.849 --> 10:53.217
Now, the race is
up to tim taylor.

10:53.218 --> 10:57.087
All he has to do
is finish the heart,
and the victory's his.

10:57.088 --> 10:58.522
Now, let me tell you,

10:58.523 --> 11:02.560
I bet my dad's gonna make
a great-looking heart.

11:02.561 --> 11:05.028
He's at the finish line.

11:05.029 --> 11:06.597
Is it great?

11:11.703 --> 11:14.071
Um, dad...

11:14.072 --> 11:16.340
That doesn't look
like a heart.

11:16.341 --> 11:19.277
It looks more
like a kidney.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.279
Well, yes, it does.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.414
Well, a heart says,
"I love you,"

11:23.415 --> 11:26.350
But a kidney says,
"I gotta go."

11:31.623 --> 11:34.325
Well, guess what.
And so do we.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.094
We'll be right back
after these words from binford.

11:40.165 --> 11:44.402
<i>I want to thank</i>
<i>our special guest</i>

12:11.930 --> 12:13.431
Yeah,
you were really good.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.233
You had the audience eating
out of the palm of your hand.

12:24.108 --> 12:25.609
<i>(randy)</i> I'll get it.

12:25.610 --> 12:28.011
Hey, don't bother.
I'm sure it's for me.

12:28.012 --> 12:29.814
It's probably heidi.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.816
Yeah, she just wants
to know what time

12:31.817 --> 12:33.818
She should come over
to baby-sit you.

12:33.819 --> 12:36.186
You're just jealous.

12:36.187 --> 12:37.921
Hello?

12:37.922 --> 12:40.691
Oh. Hi, ashley.

12:40.692 --> 12:43.994
Oh, you loved the show?
Not as much
as brad loves heidi.

12:43.995 --> 12:45.996
I'm gonna pound you,
you little punk.

12:45.997 --> 12:48.031
No, not you, ashley. Um...

12:48.032 --> 12:51.702
<i>(sing-song)</i> brad and heidi,
sitting in...
Could I call you right back?

12:51.703 --> 12:54.271
...K-I-s-s...
Hey, hey, let it go.
Come on.

12:54.272 --> 12:57.908
Just go call ashley
upstairs from our room.

12:57.909 --> 13:01.846
What are you doing?
Me? He's the one
doing all the shoving.

13:01.847 --> 13:04.548
'cause you're acting
like a jerk.
Tim, tim.

13:04.549 --> 13:06.384
Randy, what's going on?

13:06.385 --> 13:07.785
Nothing.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.788
This is a big deal for brad.
You should be happy for him.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.790
You know,
you're right, dad.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.359
Why don't I
just throw him a parade?

13:15.360 --> 13:18.262
His head's so big,
he could be a float.

13:25.637 --> 13:28.639
So what do you think
is going on with randy?

13:28.640 --> 13:30.374
There's nothing going on.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.209
He's just being
mr. Obnoxious.

13:32.210 --> 13:37.415
Maybe he's reacting to his
equally obnoxious brother,
mr. Hot-for-heidi.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.417
You should know
she's a master electrician.

13:39.418 --> 13:42.386
Yeah, right.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.723
What we have here, honey,

13:45.724 --> 13:48.626
Is a simple case
of sibling rivalry.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.828
Exactly.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.397
Which just proves,
ms. Straight-a student,

13:53.398 --> 13:56.567
That I might know
just about as much
about psychology as you do.

13:56.568 --> 13:58.268
Oh, really?

13:58.269 --> 14:00.671
What causes sibling rivalry?

14:00.672 --> 14:02.773
Having more than one kid.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.013
It's the competition
between siblings

14:10.014 --> 14:12.883
For the love and attention
of their parents.

14:12.884 --> 14:16.086
So randy's acting like this
to get our attention?

14:16.087 --> 14:19.056
No. I think
he's acting like this
to get your attention.

14:19.057 --> 14:21.291
Why does he just want
my attention?

14:21.292 --> 14:23.928
'cause you took brad
on <i>tool time.</i>

14:23.929 --> 14:26.464
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.866
This is classic freud -

14:28.867 --> 14:33.103
Transferring blame
to the tool show host.

14:33.104 --> 14:35.105
Look, all I'm saying

14:35.106 --> 14:38.408
Is that I think that randy's
feeling a little left out.

14:38.409 --> 14:41.278
He wouldn't want
to go on <i>tool time.</i>
He doesn't like tools.

14:41.279 --> 14:42.980
This goes
way beyond <i>tool time.</i>

14:42.981 --> 14:44.682
You spend more time
with brad.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.283
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

14:46.284 --> 14:48.552
You're always working
on the hot rod together,

14:48.553 --> 14:50.788
Talking about what brad's
first car should be.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.824
He'll be the first to drive.
He's the oldest.
Exactly my point.

14:53.825 --> 14:56.994
Randy is a middle child,
just like I was.

14:56.995 --> 15:00.130
We're not going through this
middle-child thing again?
Please?

15:00.131 --> 15:03.066
It was very traumatic.
I was constantly overlooked.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.735
Whenever you went to the zoo,

15:04.736 --> 15:06.904
You never got to see
the animals you wanted to see.

15:06.905 --> 15:10.040
Robin got to see the monkeys.
Katie got to see the zebras.

15:10.041 --> 15:13.978
I've heard this story
over and over and over...

15:16.414 --> 15:19.717
All I wanted to do
was see the wallabies.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.161
Hey, randy,
I was looking for you.

15:31.162 --> 15:33.163
Well, you found me.
See ya.

15:33.164 --> 15:35.032
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.501
How would you like to be
on <i>tool time</i> with me
next week?

15:37.502 --> 15:41.104
Why, is brad holding out
for more money?

15:41.105 --> 15:43.173
This has nothing
to do with brad.

15:43.174 --> 15:45.609
I thought it'd be fun.
We could do a project
together.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.011
No, thanks.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.781
Heidi will be there.

15:50.782 --> 15:53.717
She's a master electrician.

15:55.319 --> 15:57.555
<i>(wilson)</i> is that you, tim?
Hi, wilson.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.123
Neighbor, have you seen
my fuzzy woolly bear?

16:00.124 --> 16:03.460
No, and I'd like
to keep it that way.

16:05.997 --> 16:08.498
No, tim,
the fuzzy woolly bear
I'm referring to

16:08.499 --> 16:10.601
Is a type of caterpillar.

16:10.602 --> 16:13.470
Oh, there you are,
little fella.

16:13.471 --> 16:18.809
Just one question, wilson.
Pet or dinner?

16:18.810 --> 16:20.911
It's a weather forecaster,
tim.

16:20.912 --> 16:24.147
By measuring
the width of the stripe
on the caterpillar's back,

16:24.148 --> 16:26.984
I can tell you
how long and cold
the winter's gonna be.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.987
I wish I had a caterpillar
to tell me what to do
about randy.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.389
He's upset
because he thinks I favor brad.

16:32.390 --> 16:35.092
Well, do you feel
that's true?
No.

16:35.093 --> 16:37.394
I do things with both
of the guys, you know.

16:37.395 --> 16:41.231
Brad and I go to sporting
events, work on the hot rod,
build stuff with my tools.

16:41.232 --> 16:44.234
Randy and I joke. I make jokes,
he makes jokes, we make jokes.

16:44.235 --> 16:47.071
The jokes go back and forth.
He jokes, I joke.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.106
There's a lot of jokes
going on.

16:49.107 --> 16:52.076
Sounds like you share
your jocularity.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.412
No, he couldn't fit
into mine.

16:57.782 --> 17:02.052
Truth is, wilson,
I'm not that interested
in the things that randy does.

17:02.053 --> 17:05.321
Playing with his computer,
listening to heavy metal music,

17:05.323 --> 17:08.425
Reading books without the word
"illustrated" on the cover.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.961
Well, it sounds to me like
it's just more difficult

17:10.962 --> 17:12.963
For you to connect
with randy.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.297
I guess so.

17:14.298 --> 17:15.965
Well, tim, I'm reminded

17:15.967 --> 17:18.602
Of what
the chinese philosopher
chuang-tzu said.

17:18.603 --> 17:21.605
"you cannot speak of the ocean
to a well frog.

17:21.606 --> 17:24.406
You cannot speak of ice
to a summer insect."

17:24.407 --> 17:28.411
You can't speak chinese
to a tool man.

17:28.412 --> 17:30.413
What are you talking about?

17:30.414 --> 17:33.183
All I'm saying is if randy
is feeling overlooked,

17:33.184 --> 17:36.520
Maybe you have to
try a little harder
to find a way into his world.

17:36.521 --> 17:40.557
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah, gotta get
into his world.

17:44.262 --> 17:47.097
See ya, mom.
Hey, wait.
Where you going?

17:47.098 --> 17:49.767
To the mall. I'm just gonna
meet a lot of my friends.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.402
They're probably
just gonna tell me
how great I am.

17:52.403 --> 17:55.673
Brad, brad, wait a minute.
Come back. I want to talk
to you.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.142
What?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.978
I know that you were
a guest star

18:00.979 --> 18:04.214
On a low-rated cable show
for a half an hour,

18:04.215 --> 18:06.383
But don't you think
that you're getting

18:06.384 --> 18:08.385
A little puffed up
with yourself?

18:08.386 --> 18:11.922
Well, I mean, I can't help it
if everybody loved me.

18:11.923 --> 18:14.758
I don't think
that randy loved you so much.

18:14.759 --> 18:17.661
Mom, come on. I mean,
randy was a total jerk.

18:17.662 --> 18:19.730
He made fun
of everything I did.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.399
Well, that's because
you got to be on tv
and he didn't.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.169
So you're saying
randy's jealous of me?

18:25.170 --> 18:26.937
Yeah, a little.

18:26.938 --> 18:28.238
Cool.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.642
Brad, I want you
to think about this.

18:32.643 --> 18:35.079
How do you feel
when randy comes home

18:35.080 --> 18:37.214
With a really great
report card

18:37.215 --> 18:40.550
And waves that around
under your face?

18:40.551 --> 18:43.253
Not so cool.
Yeah.

18:43.254 --> 18:46.023
And, see, this is
kinda harder for randy,

18:46.024 --> 18:48.558
Because he's a middle child,
just like I was.

18:48.559 --> 18:53.764
Mom, mom, please,
not the wallaby story.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.666
We went to the zoo
every year.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.869
Robin got to see
the monkeys...

18:58.870 --> 19:01.805
Oh, no. No!

19:06.577 --> 19:08.445
<i>(knock on door/</i>
<i>door opens)</i>

19:09.647 --> 19:13.283
Hey, randy, how are things
in your world?

19:13.284 --> 19:15.119
What?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.854
What are you doing?

19:16.855 --> 19:20.224
Just finishing up
some biology homework.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.459
Need help?
Nope.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.994
Good.

19:28.399 --> 19:32.102
I came up here
to talk about what's going on.

19:32.103 --> 19:33.804
Nothing's going on.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.340
Randy, something's going on,
and I'm pretty sure
it's my fault.

19:37.341 --> 19:39.009
What do you mean?

19:39.010 --> 19:43.781
Well, this ancient chinese
ice-cream salesman, young zoo,

19:43.782 --> 19:46.817
Found that frozen frogs
and wet insects couldn't talk

19:46.818 --> 19:49.552
'cause they were cold
to one another.

19:56.261 --> 19:59.163
Sure thing, dad.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.398
What I'm trying to say is

20:01.399 --> 20:04.401
If it seems like I spend
more time with brad than you,

20:04.402 --> 20:07.037
It's because we share
similar interests,

20:07.038 --> 20:10.207
And I wish I was interested
in the same things you are,
but...

20:10.208 --> 20:13.811
Just because I'm not
doesn't mean I love you
any less.

20:13.812 --> 20:17.547
Do you understand that?
Yeah, I guess.

20:17.548 --> 20:20.717
You know, of all the boys,
I figure you and I
are the most alike.

20:20.718 --> 20:23.720
Oh, come on, dad.
I mean, you and brad
are the most alike.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.889
No, no. We share
similar interests,

20:25.890 --> 20:28.292
But you and I
have similar personalities.

20:28.293 --> 20:31.195
If a guy's walking
down the street
with his fly down,

20:31.196 --> 20:34.064
If I can't
come up with a joke,
I know you'll back me up.

20:36.734 --> 20:39.469
Well, I mean,
you gotta make the fly joke.

20:39.470 --> 20:41.939
That's right.
You gotta make the fly joke.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.273
Hey, pal, you know
your fly's down?

20:43.274 --> 20:46.844
It's cheaper
than air conditioning.
Zoom!

20:46.845 --> 20:49.246
Hey, buddy,
you know your fly's down?

20:49.247 --> 20:52.682
No, but I know
"fly me to the moon."
hey! All right.

20:52.683 --> 20:54.517
What is that thing?

20:54.518 --> 20:56.920
It's a disk that has
<i>zombie sneak attack</i> on it.

20:56.921 --> 20:59.556
Oh, zombies. Love zombies.
Can two play this game?

20:59.557 --> 21:00.891
Yeah.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.727
Let's play.
All right.

21:03.728 --> 21:05.628
What are we waiting for?

21:05.629 --> 21:07.731
It's gonna take a minute
to boot up.

21:07.732 --> 21:10.367
I still have
that old l30 chip in it.

21:10.368 --> 21:12.002
Not much power.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.048
Are you saying
this thing needs more power?

21:25.049 --> 21:28.085
Lemme open it up.
I can make this thing go faster.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.854
Well, why don't we
just save you the trouble

21:30.855 --> 21:33.456
And throw it
up against the wall?

21:39.230 --> 21:43.967
<i>(tim on tv) watch out!</i>
<i>The finish line...</i>
<i>Checkered flag!</i>

21:46.637 --> 21:49.639
Don't you ever get sick
of watching yourself
on <i>tool time?</i>

21:49.640 --> 21:51.574
Shh. Are you kidding me?

21:51.575 --> 21:53.576
Every time
I watch that videotape,

21:53.577 --> 21:57.014
I always find something else
I like about me.

21:57.015 --> 21:59.016
You know,
it's true what they say.

21:59.017 --> 22:02.986
You're better on tape
than you are in person.

22:02.987 --> 22:06.290
Well... Do you really think
I stunk?

22:06.291 --> 22:08.491
Nah, I thought
you did a jerrific tob.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.397
Thanks. Hey, you wanna go play
some <i>zombie sneak attack?</i>

22:13.398 --> 22:17.034
Uh, can't do it.
Dad made a few adjustments.

22:17.035 --> 22:20.470
Zombies won't be coming back
from the dead anymore.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.416
Well done, dad.
Thank you, son. Oop.

22:38.289 --> 22:41.291
I'm sure you'll love
our next gadget here.
That's right.

22:41.292 --> 22:44.294
You're on the job site,
it's been raining all day,

22:44.295 --> 22:46.363
Your boots are sop...
Soap...

22:49.167 --> 22:51.501
Yes. Get...

22:51.502 --> 22:54.104
<i>(woman)</i> here we go. Replay.

22:54.105 --> 22:56.373
