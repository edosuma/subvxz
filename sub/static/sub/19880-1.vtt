04:48.241 --> 04:49.735
Sorry for your loss.

04:49.736 --> 04:51.230
Thank you.

06:12.754 --> 06:14.576
Hey! God!

06:14.577 --> 06:16.968
Damn! Damn it!

06:16.969 --> 06:18.433
God!

06:22.987 --> 06:25.517
What was that? You okay?

06:25.518 --> 06:28.447
Yeah, I'm fine, Fern.

06:29.643 --> 06:31.605
Is that what I think it is?

06:31.606 --> 06:33.757
Yeah. It's...

06:33.758 --> 06:35.760
my ex-wife.

06:35.761 --> 06:38.649
Even though
we weren't together anymore,

06:38.650 --> 06:41.440
I always knew
she was out there somewhere.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.937
Now she's in that damn box,
and...

06:46.960 --> 06:48.723
Little hard
to wrap my head around.

06:54.612 --> 06:55.867
Why you gotta do it so hard?

06:55.868 --> 06:58.298
It's called therapy, Leonard.

06:58.299 --> 06:59.862
I know.

06:59.863 --> 07:01.426
Thought you were gonna
fix this place up.

07:01.427 --> 07:04.715
We... Well, you could do
so much with it.

07:04.855 --> 07:06.418
I got it just the way I want it.

07:06.419 --> 07:08.142
It's a little depressing.

07:08.143 --> 07:09.975
I feel like Uncle Chester
haunts this place.

07:09.976 --> 07:11.938
Yeah, well, maybe he do.

07:11.939 --> 07:14.858
Can we watch the damn movie?

07:14.859 --> 07:17.458
But I'm not gonna be quite so...
You know he's gay, right?

07:17.459 --> 07:19.351
Who?

07:19.352 --> 07:21.943
Randolph Scott. Bullshit.

07:23.238 --> 07:25.170
See how he looks
at that other man?

07:25.171 --> 07:26.695
Randolph Scott ain't gay.
He a cowboy.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.687
I'm talking about the actor.
I couldn't care

07:28.688 --> 07:30.182
if he sucked all the dick
in Hollywood

07:30.183 --> 07:31.985
and wore
his grandmama's panties.

07:31.986 --> 07:33.978
Can we get back
to watching the movie?

07:33.979 --> 07:37.037
Someone's pissy. I'm not pissy!

07:37.038 --> 07:39.360
- Made me apologize.
- Apologize to her?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.258
There he go
doing that shit again.

07:42.259 --> 07:45.118
No. No, no. Easy.
Raul, get up off me!

07:45.119 --> 07:47.977
Mnh-mnh. Hell, no.

07:47.978 --> 07:49.233
Hey, Melton!

07:49.234 --> 07:52.062
You call that a dick, Melton?

07:52.063 --> 07:55.121
I done sucked on pinky toes
bigger than that shit.

07:55.122 --> 07:57.284
Stop pissing on my rose bush,
boy!

07:59.148 --> 08:00.940
Call when you cool down.

08:00.941 --> 08:04.268
I am cool. This damn fool
stop pissing on my property!

08:04.269 --> 08:06.091
This ain't your litter box, pig!

08:06.092 --> 08:07.687
- Ooh!
- No.

08:10.247 --> 08:12.310
Call you later.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.763
I don't bother y'all, right?

08:16.764 --> 08:18.795
I mind my business.

08:18.796 --> 08:21.058
Whatever happened
to live and let live?

08:22.782 --> 08:24.545
Hold on. Let me give you
something.

08:26.209 --> 08:27.734
Shit.

08:31.759 --> 08:33.592
Pretty, ain't it?

08:33.592 --> 08:36.182
Come on, don't just stand there!

08:36.183 --> 08:38.743
Hey, MeMaw! How you doing today?

08:38.744 --> 08:42.659
Yeah, I am great!

08:44.961 --> 08:47.083
Hey, looky here, I'm-a leave
that cane here with him,

08:47.084 --> 08:49.913
in case he might need it
when he come to.

08:58.153 --> 08:59.687
You ain't do nothing either!

08:59.688 --> 09:01.152
What do you want?

09:01.153 --> 09:02.976
Just a little of
your time... about 20 years.

09:04.839 --> 09:07.668
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:07.669 --> 09:09.761
You need a little grease
in that skillet.

09:19.536 --> 09:22.057
Aw, shit!

09:35.886 --> 09:38.018
Hell, no.

09:38.019 --> 09:39.912
Lower than that, Dre. Drop it!

09:41.905 --> 09:43.438
Nah, it's gotta go
even lower than that.

09:43.439 --> 09:44.934
- You know why?
- Why?

10:31.614 --> 10:34.373
You said it was important.
What's up?

10:34.374 --> 10:36.495
Was Randolph Scott gay?

10:36.496 --> 10:39.355
Is that what you called me
over here for?

10:39.356 --> 10:40.721
No.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.476
What's in the box?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.509
Well... Trudy.

10:46.510 --> 10:48.701
Trudy? Well, what's left of her.

10:48.702 --> 10:50.763
What you walkin' around
with her for, Hap?

10:50.764 --> 10:53.354
I don't know. I mean...

10:53.355 --> 10:55.446
don't seem right
leaving her in the car.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.210
You need to leave her home.

10:57.211 --> 10:58.605
I just came from work.

10:58.606 --> 11:01.595
You got her doing oil changes
for you now?

11:03.528 --> 11:06.785
That bitch almost got me killed.

11:06.786 --> 11:08.580
She ain't coming in here.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.863
You need to bury her, Hap.

11:12.864 --> 11:15.324
I know. I know.

11:15.325 --> 11:16.760
It's just...

11:19.550 --> 11:22.110
I don't know what
she would have wanted.

11:22.111 --> 11:23.704
The dead don't give a shit
what happen to 'em, Hap.

11:23.705 --> 11:26.135
They're dead.

11:26.136 --> 11:29.393
It's fools like us left behind
got to deal with this shit!

11:29.394 --> 11:32.682
It's bad, Hap. Real bad.

11:34.675 --> 11:36.537
That's not so bad.

11:36.538 --> 11:39.496
Yeah, slap a new board down
on that in no time.

11:39.497 --> 11:41.260
I'm not talking 'bout
the hole, Hap.

11:41.261 --> 11:44.250
I'm talking about what's inside
the hole. Look.

11:49.003 --> 11:51.663
Hell, no.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.709
You never smelled anything
funny?

12:00.710 --> 12:03.341
It's an old man's house, Hap.
Everything smells funny.

12:06.599 --> 12:08.223
One, two, three.

12:13.713 --> 12:17.628
It's a kid.

12:17.629 --> 12:19.989
What the hell is Chester doing
with a dead kid's body

12:19.990 --> 12:21.454
under his house? I don't know.

12:21.455 --> 12:23.517
Maybe... maybe... maybe he
didn't know it was here.

12:23.518 --> 12:25.539
He been here for 40 years.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.044
Body ain't been here
that long, Hap.

12:27.045 --> 12:28.500
Look at the damn sneakers.

12:32.625 --> 12:34.387
Put it down! Put it down!
What?! What?! What?!

12:34.388 --> 12:36.450
It's a crime scene, Leonard.

12:36.451 --> 12:39.838
You already got your prints
all over the damn shoe.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.594
What's the matter with
you? Hold up! I'm going first!

12:43.595 --> 12:46.125
What kind of Marine were you?!
I'm going first!

12:46.126 --> 12:47.320
Come on.

12:47.321 --> 12:49.543
That goddamn sicko.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.265
He left me a house
with a dead body under it.

12:54.266 --> 12:56.427
Maybe it's not like it looks.

12:56.428 --> 12:59.984
How is it not
what it look like, Hap?

12:59.985 --> 13:03.113
He upstairs here, teaching me
how to tie a fishing fly,

13:03.114 --> 13:06.969
tucking me into bed at night,
reading me bedtime stories.

13:06.970 --> 13:09.898
And we got a dead body
rotting under our feet.

13:09.899 --> 13:12.519
Right under our feet!

13:12.520 --> 13:14.083
We're gonna have to report it
to the cops.

13:14.084 --> 13:17.242
Aw, shit. Hell, no. Hell, no.

13:17.243 --> 13:20.430
Hey, okay, we'll just...
Just leave it, fix the floor.

13:20.431 --> 13:23.828
If your uncle did it,
he's beyond punishment now.

13:23.829 --> 13:25.352
No one's gonna know about it,

13:25.353 --> 13:28.980
and he ain't gonna hurt
anybody else, so pssh.

13:32.099 --> 13:34.260
You don't mean that.

13:34.261 --> 13:38.016
No, I don't.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.744
Yeah, a-a small,
sad part of me means it.

13:44.274 --> 13:45.698
The hell? Hey!

13:45.699 --> 13:46.993
Hey! You better...

13:46.994 --> 13:48.787
No, hey, that's...
That's my wife! Hey!

13:48.788 --> 13:50.052
Take off on him! Cut him off!

13:50.053 --> 13:51.447
Take off on him! Hey, come on!

13:51.448 --> 13:53.122
Go get it, white boy!
Go get it, white boy!

14:11.665 --> 14:13.757
Get! Damn!

14:15.122 --> 14:17.115
Don't y'all come back
in this house!

14:27.587 --> 14:29.620
Damn... it.

14:31.642 --> 14:33.944
I just saw your dumb ass.

14:42.752 --> 14:44.117
Gotcha.

14:46.837 --> 14:48.570
Hey, no!

14:48.571 --> 14:50.533
No! Trudy!

14:50.534 --> 14:51.788
No, come back!

14:51.789 --> 14:54.847
No, no, no, man!

14:54.848 --> 14:57.877
God... damn!

15:02.998 --> 15:05.628
What... Why did you... What...

15:05.629 --> 15:09.216
God.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.772
You get him? You get him?

15:23.773 --> 15:25.536
Why'd he have to break
the window?

15:25.537 --> 15:26.931
The door was open. You slow.

15:26.932 --> 15:28.466
Why don't you go take a nap?

15:42.565 --> 15:44.885
Son of a bitch is fast.

15:44.886 --> 15:46.849
You just old and slow, is all.

15:49.510 --> 15:50.904
Asshole.

15:53.595 --> 15:56.453
What do I do now?

15:56.454 --> 15:58.984
Hell, I lost her.

15:58.985 --> 16:01.576
She gone.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.432
No, she not.

16:10.523 --> 16:12.585
Thanks, man.

16:12.586 --> 16:14.539
I owe you.

16:15.973 --> 16:19.531
She's dead, and I'm still
cleaning up her damn mess.

16:39.847 --> 16:42.466
Caught Casper here
running down the street.

16:42.467 --> 16:46.293
He steal something of yours,

16:49.721 --> 16:51.813
No, sir, officer.

16:58.260 --> 16:59.654
Let him go.

16:59.655 --> 17:04.377
Get outta here,
creepy little shit.

17:04.377 --> 17:05.811
Hey...

17:10.196 --> 17:11.690
Go ahead.

17:11.691 --> 17:13.226
Hey, officer?

17:16.314 --> 17:19.901
Something we should show you.

17:41.144 --> 17:44.471
Just like Christmas.

17:44.472 --> 17:47.063
Ho, ho, ho.

17:58.401 --> 18:01.160
Shit, I don't believe it
for a minute.

18:01.161 --> 18:04.448
I don't care if they found
babies in his toilet.

18:04.449 --> 18:08.374
Chester didn't murder
and saw up no children.

18:08.375 --> 18:12.699
Yeah, well, we don't know what
Chester did or didn't do.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.362
Now, Leonard,

18:14.363 --> 18:17.621
your uncle was bitter and black
as burnt coffee.

18:17.622 --> 18:20.082
Everybody in the neighborhood
know that.

18:20.083 --> 18:23.142
But being mean don't make you
no killer.

18:29.170 --> 18:32.796
Guess they already decided
that Chester did it.

18:32.797 --> 18:35.257
That's what I'm afraid of, too.

18:35.258 --> 18:37.450
What the...

18:40.837 --> 18:43.895
Leonard, you watch yourself
around them boys.

18:43.896 --> 18:46.227
Bad things happen in that house.

18:46.228 --> 18:47.721
Yes, ma'am.

18:47.722 --> 18:49.286
Melton already
ain't none too pleased

18:49.287 --> 18:51.677
you peed on his head.

18:51.678 --> 18:53.341
Wait, what?

18:53.342 --> 18:57.197
I'll talk to you about
that later.

18:57.198 --> 19:01.023
Every little child you see
go in that house and come out,

19:01.024 --> 19:04.043
they done sold them some drugs.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.735
Killin' they own.

19:08.736 --> 19:10.160
You peed on his head?

19:10.161 --> 19:12.722
I'll talk to you
about it later! Damn.

19:39.524 --> 19:41.148
How you doin', Miss MeMaw?

19:45.702 --> 19:47.195
Finish your pie, boys. We gonna
take a little trip

19:47.196 --> 19:48.630
down to the station.

19:48.631 --> 19:51.191
- What?
- Don't worry, Leonard.

19:51.192 --> 19:54.012
The Lord watches over
the righteous.

19:57.967 --> 20:00.498
We got you right over here.
Come on.

21:48.486 --> 21:51.175
So tell me about Chester.

21:51.176 --> 21:52.701
He like kids?

21:54.365 --> 21:56.456
Chester ain't like nobody,
far as I rememba.

21:56.457 --> 21:59.913
Might have liked you, though.

21:59.914 --> 22:01.478
Kinda remind me of him,

22:01.479 --> 22:04.407
all that Southern charm
you oozin'.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.832
You ever,

22:05.833 --> 22:08.462
see any kids over at that place?

22:08.463 --> 22:11.192
Just the ones next door.

22:11.193 --> 22:13.783
He didn't seem to like 'em much,
believe it or not.

22:13.784 --> 22:15.248
Understandable.

22:15.249 --> 22:17.340
They don't exactly
light up the neighborhood.

22:17.341 --> 22:18.805
You're gonna,

22:18.806 --> 22:21.266
you're gonna interrogate them,
too, though?

22:21.267 --> 22:23.119
Yeah?

22:23.120 --> 22:25.779
I'll ask the questions here,
you don't mind.

22:25.780 --> 22:28.709
So what happened between
you and Chester, anyway?

22:28.710 --> 22:30.472
I grew up.

22:30.473 --> 22:33.591
He found out about my nature
and threw me out.

22:33.592 --> 22:38.154
Now, you people, you like
little boys, too, don't ya?

22:38.155 --> 22:40.248
"You people"?

22:42.271 --> 22:45.498
I thought you was my people.

22:45.499 --> 22:48.587
I like little boys as much
as you like little girls...

22:48.588 --> 22:50.251
brotha.

22:50.252 --> 22:52.713
It says here,
Leonard was a... war hero?

22:54.406 --> 22:56.737
I was in 'Nam myself.
How about you?

22:56.738 --> 22:59.527
Conscientious objector.

22:59.528 --> 23:02.018
Yeah.

23:02.019 --> 23:05.247
You did... two years for it?

23:06.971 --> 23:09.202
Was it worth it?

23:09.203 --> 23:11.434
I wasn't in 'Nam.

23:11.435 --> 23:13.486
You tell me.

23:13.487 --> 23:16.246
Probably was.

23:16.247 --> 23:19.146
Ya know, ya uncle came down
to the station

23:19.147 --> 23:21.009
more than once,

23:21.010 --> 23:23.231
talkin' about missing kids.

23:23.232 --> 23:25.393
Hell, maybe even a child murder.

23:25.394 --> 23:27.117
Why ain't you lookin' into it,
then?

23:27.118 --> 23:29.249
I mean, that is what y'all do
'round here, ain't it?

23:29.250 --> 23:31.311
You wanna talk about what
happened at Leonard's place

23:31.312 --> 23:33.304
about three months back?

23:33.305 --> 23:36.134
A real, bloodbath,
according to my report.

23:36.135 --> 23:38.655
We got mixed up with
a bad bunch of people.

23:38.656 --> 23:42.282
And they got dead. Lot of 'em.

23:42.283 --> 23:44.613
Including my ex-wife.

23:44.614 --> 23:48.071
Yeah, she was...

23:48.072 --> 23:50.890
some kind of anarchist, I hear.

23:50.891 --> 23:53.551
She was a waitress.

23:53.552 --> 23:56.839
You ever lose someone
you love, Detective?

23:56.840 --> 24:00.535
'Cause I see where you're
headin' here. Let me...

24:00.536 --> 24:04.262
Let me help you get there.

24:04.263 --> 24:06.553
I didn't kill nobody.

24:06.554 --> 24:08.945
Last time Chester came in here,
he said that

24:08.946 --> 24:11.406
him and his associate said that
they was gonna prove

24:11.407 --> 24:14.236
that something was happening
and who was doing it,

24:14.237 --> 24:16.129
if we'd give him
a little bit of help.

24:16.130 --> 24:17.823
"Associate"? Yeah.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.516
Well, why ain't y'all
out talkin' to him?

24:19.517 --> 24:21.510
How do I know I'm not?

24:25.107 --> 24:27.029
You identify the body yet?

24:27.030 --> 24:28.394
Well, it's a little hard
to identify a body

24:28.395 --> 24:30.088
when it's that far gone.

24:30.089 --> 24:32.122
What about the shoes?

24:34.214 --> 24:36.774
The shoes? The red sneakers?

24:36.775 --> 24:38.896
Mnh-mnh, body have no feet.

24:38.897 --> 24:40.430
Come on.

24:40.431 --> 24:42.852
The body had feet, all right,
and the feet had sneakers.

24:42.853 --> 24:44.117
We both saw 'em.

24:44.118 --> 24:45.911
No hands, no feet, no sneakers.

24:45.912 --> 24:47.346
You tellin' us
we missed somethin'?

25:02.272 --> 25:04.902
Don't say another word.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.761
I'm-a get you outta here.

25:07.762 --> 25:11.120
Gentlemen,
a word outside, please?

25:15.833 --> 25:19.658
Yeah. Who the hell is that?

25:19.659 --> 25:21.124
Think that's my lawyer.

25:22.847 --> 25:25.607
Maybe I need
to get me a lawyer, too.

25:27.670 --> 25:29.761
Close your mouth, Hap.
You're droolin'.

25:29.762 --> 25:32.622
Okay.

25:36.617 --> 25:42.296
Have you ever had the Armadillo
deluxe burger, Miss Grange?

25:42.297 --> 25:43.760
It's beef, not armadillo,

25:43.761 --> 25:45.256
if that's what
you're worried about.

25:46.950 --> 25:48.953
Right.

25:51.543 --> 25:53.575
Something wrong?

25:53.576 --> 25:56.096
No, no, no, sorry. I was just,

25:56.097 --> 26:00.081
Don't underestimate me because
I'm beautiful, Mr. Collins.

26:00.082 --> 26:01.845
Hi, Miriam. Florida.

26:01.846 --> 26:03.708
What can I get y'all folks?

26:03.709 --> 26:05.242
Usual for me.

26:05.243 --> 26:07.833
And I'll have the armadillo
chicken-fried steak.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.826
And you, sir?

26:09.827 --> 26:13.014
You got anything without
the armadillo in front of it?

26:13.015 --> 26:15.914
Water.

26:15.915 --> 26:20.069
Okay. I'll take
the armadillo burger.

26:20.070 --> 26:21.564
Hold the fries.

26:24.952 --> 26:26.645
So Detective Hanson said

26:26.646 --> 26:29.006
that Chester claims
to have had an associate.

26:29.007 --> 26:30.869
Told me the same thing.

26:30.870 --> 26:32.663
I ain't like the way he looked
at me when he said it, though.

26:32.664 --> 26:34.626
You shouldn't.
This is the East Side.

26:34.627 --> 26:37.525
Cops bring in a black man,
they don't look much further.

26:37.526 --> 26:41.780
Look, I found a dead body
under Chester's floor.

26:41.781 --> 26:43.035
I called the cops
and reported it.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.799
I did the right thing.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.160
It's not Chester's floor.
It's yours.

26:47.161 --> 26:49.123
And pissin' on
your neighbor's head

26:49.124 --> 26:51.016
is not exactly
Boy Scout behavior.

26:51.017 --> 26:53.079
Yeah.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.972
You heard about that?

26:54.973 --> 26:57.632
Miss Miriam, did you hear about
Leonard and Melton?

26:57.633 --> 27:00.831
Lord, yes.

27:00.832 --> 27:02.684
Dessert's on the house.

27:02.685 --> 27:04.886
Pissed on his head.

27:04.887 --> 27:06.908
That's a good one.

27:06.909 --> 27:08.602
Don't worry about it.

27:08.603 --> 27:12.628
I think you scored some points
with Charlie and Hanson.

27:12.629 --> 27:15.856
Yeah, they should
be investigating them.

27:15.857 --> 27:18.975
Melton's selling drugs
all hours of the night to kids.

27:18.976 --> 27:21.436
They aren't and they won't.

27:21.437 --> 27:23.339
Where does that leave him?

27:23.340 --> 27:26.457
Out of jail for now, but...

27:26.458 --> 27:28.590
that boy doesn't turn out
to be black,

27:28.591 --> 27:31.409
it's gonna get much worse.

27:31.410 --> 27:34.568
Okay.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.567
Find a dead kid, and we gotta
hope he's black?

27:37.568 --> 27:40.756
They're gonna pin this
on Chester and drop it.

27:40.757 --> 27:42.818
All you gotta do,
keep out of trouble

27:42.819 --> 27:45.380
and don't piss on anyone's head.
Can you do that?

27:48.598 --> 27:52.822
It's a pleasure having
boys in the house again.

27:52.823 --> 27:56.777
All I got left at home now.

27:56.778 --> 27:59.906
That's quite a collection
of photos you got there, MeMaw.

27:59.907 --> 28:03.533
There's one of Chester
and Leonard up there somewhere.

28:03.534 --> 28:08.486
I took it when Leonard was just
a-a wee slip of a boy.

28:10.449 --> 28:13.636
He talked about you a lot,

28:13.637 --> 28:15.430
'specially near the end.

28:15.431 --> 28:17.691
Bet there was a whole lotta
cursing involved.

28:17.692 --> 28:22.315
He was proud of you, Leonard,
for serving your country.

28:22.316 --> 28:24.277
Kinda sad and sorry

28:24.278 --> 28:27.537
the way things went down
between you two.

28:28.732 --> 28:30.794
Yeah, well,
might've said somethin'.

28:30.795 --> 28:32.249
Well, I believe he would

28:32.250 --> 28:34.352
if you'd come 'round
once in a while.

28:36.375 --> 28:39.333
I'm TJ!

28:39.334 --> 28:41.625
Hey, hi. I-I'm Hap.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.687
This... this is Leonard.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.251
How you doin'?

28:45.252 --> 28:46.777
You wash your hand, boy?

28:50.842 --> 28:53.760
That boy got squirrel turds
for brains,

28:53.761 --> 28:57.258
but he got a gentle heart.

28:57.259 --> 28:59.779
If the meek do inherit
the Earth,

28:59.780 --> 29:03.106
that boy got a big cut coming.

29:03.107 --> 29:04.732
Good night now.

29:05.768 --> 29:07.291
I'll take the first shift.

29:07.292 --> 29:08.727
Yeah.

29:26.542 --> 29:28.534
You gotta bury her, Hap.

29:28.535 --> 29:30.099
She's dead.

29:33.198 --> 29:36.246
The world's full of Floridas.

29:36.247 --> 29:37.612
Yeah.

29:40.073 --> 29:43.501
Beautiful women who don't want
to be with me.

29:45.593 --> 29:48.920
You are some comfort.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.312
TJ on top!

29:58.995 --> 30:00.419
Top, my ass.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.233
Len?

30:10.234 --> 30:13.591
You really think that...

30:13.592 --> 30:15.415
Chester might have done it?

30:16.511 --> 30:18.344
I don't know, Hap.

30:20.267 --> 30:24.062
Either way,
I'm-a find out, though.

30:24.063 --> 30:26.215
Good night, Leonard.

30:26.216 --> 30:27.949
Night, Hap.

30:29.344 --> 30:31.535
Good night, Leonard.

30:31.536 --> 30:34.196
Night, TJ.

30:34.197 --> 30:36.328
Good night, white man.

30:36.329 --> 30:40.016
Good night, TJ.

30:47.967 --> 30:51.154
TJ, that's enough!

30:51.155 --> 30:53.147
You gonna get a tapeworm.

30:53.148 --> 30:56.873
That boy would eat a whole bowl
of sugar if I let him.

30:56.874 --> 30:58.169
Hey. Hey, morning.

30:58.170 --> 31:00.062
Morning. Hap.

31:00.063 --> 31:02.762
This my other grandson.

31:02.763 --> 31:05.213
James. Fitzgerald. Local pastor.

31:05.214 --> 31:06.817
Well, nice to meet you, sir.

31:06.818 --> 31:08.242
Likewise.

31:08.243 --> 31:09.707
Leonard and I were just sharing

31:09.708 --> 31:11.171
some memories of his uncle.

31:11.172 --> 31:13.194
He and I used to have
some interesting discussions

31:13.195 --> 31:15.386
about, God and religion.

31:15.387 --> 31:18.445
He seemed bothered by
the subject, too.

31:18.446 --> 31:21.175
Now, see, if I recall...

31:21.176 --> 31:25.360
it was hypocrisy he had
a problem with, not religion.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.264
Play nice.

31:28.759 --> 31:31.647
Hap, go fix you a plate.

31:31.648 --> 31:33.411
Yes, ma'am.

31:33.412 --> 31:36.838
I was just reminding Leonard of
the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

31:36.839 --> 31:38.632
You familiar with it?

31:38.633 --> 31:41.820
Hap is very familiar with them
ol' Baptist queer allegories,

31:41.821 --> 31:43.614
ain't you, Hap?

31:43.615 --> 31:46.872
He especially like
the one about, Lot,

31:46.873 --> 31:49.163
when his wife turned into
a pillar of salt

31:49.164 --> 31:50.928
right before his eyes.

31:51.127 --> 31:52.930
I was actually
referring to the part

31:52.931 --> 31:55.471
where Lot takes the angels
into his house

31:55.472 --> 31:58.559
and finds it surrounded
by homosexuals

31:58.560 --> 31:59.825
who want to know them.

31:59.826 --> 32:01.519
Funny how you skipped the part

32:01.520 --> 32:03.481
where Lot tries to protect
the angels

32:03.482 --> 32:07.068
by offering up his daughters
to the Sodomites instead.

32:07.069 --> 32:09.061
Lot's poor choice.

32:09.062 --> 32:11.961
See, that's the part I like.

32:11.962 --> 32:14.612
"Look here, we got some guests
that the homos want to screw."

32:14.712 --> 32:17.341
"But they ain't finished with
they chicken-fried steak yet,

32:17.342 --> 32:19.533
"so we gonna offer y'all up
to 'em.

32:19.534 --> 32:21.835
Shuck them panties
and hit the porch!"

32:21.836 --> 32:23.389
Now that's enough!

32:23.390 --> 32:24.953
No more talkin' about
religion or panties

32:24.954 --> 32:26.886
at this breakfast table.

32:26.887 --> 32:29.975
Yes, ma'am.
These boys had a long night.

32:29.976 --> 32:31.639
Let 'em eat, James.

32:31.640 --> 32:32.964
Yes, ma'am.

32:32.965 --> 32:34.359
I can see we're not gonna

32:34.360 --> 32:35.894
come to an understanding
on this, anyway.

32:35.895 --> 32:38.624
I think we understand
each other just fine, sir.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.547
"Shuck them panties"!

32:40.548 --> 32:42.579
Don't talk
with food in your mouth.

32:42.580 --> 32:45.499
I taught you better than that.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.731
Enjoy your breakfast.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.355
I'm gonna finish my run.

32:49.356 --> 32:51.288
Yeah, you do that.

32:51.289 --> 32:52.852
You take care
of yourself now, MeMaw.

32:52.853 --> 32:54.347
Have a good day now.

32:54.348 --> 32:56.409
Hey.

32:56.410 --> 32:57.834
Don't mind James.

32:57.835 --> 33:00.793
He forgets that he's not always
at the pulpit.

33:00.794 --> 33:02.926
He stays in shape, though,
doesn't he, MeMaw?

33:02.927 --> 33:05.746
He was a Golden Glove boxer
when he was a boy.

33:07.311 --> 33:08.675
I'm-a go check on what's left
of my house.

33:08.676 --> 33:10.269
All right, Mama, love ya.

33:10.270 --> 33:11.605
Thanks for breakfast.

34:13.768 --> 34:15.532
Boy, what's wrong witchu?!

34:15.533 --> 34:18.690
That's a surefire way to get
your butt shot smooth off!

34:18.690 --> 34:20.286
Breakin' into people's house
like this!

34:21.650 --> 34:24.370
Hey!

34:24.371 --> 34:26.603
Hey. Come here.

34:43.391 --> 34:45.324
His name's Ivan.

34:45.324 --> 34:48.213
Well, at least that's what
he says it is.

34:48.214 --> 34:51.003
How is he?

34:51.004 --> 34:53.235
Good thing you brought him in
as quick as you did.

34:53.235 --> 34:55.626
He OD'd. Damn Melton.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.888
Got them kids coming in and out
all hours of the night.

34:57.889 --> 35:00.010
I know.

35:00.011 --> 35:03.368
We haven't been able to track
down his parents, so...

35:03.369 --> 35:05.133
So?

35:08.231 --> 35:11.220
I need you to sign right there.

35:11.221 --> 35:13.980
It says you're his uncle.
Uncle Leonard.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.375
You're crazy, boy. Leonard...

35:15.376 --> 35:17.198
You're crazy.
Leonard, Leonard, please.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.430
Help me keep him out
of the system, please.

35:19.431 --> 35:23.186
Please. At least until
I find his parents.

35:23.187 --> 35:27.879
Look, if you wanna be
his family, go right ahead.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.334
What I know about raising a kid?

35:29.335 --> 35:31.038
What did Uncle Chester know
about raising a kid

35:31.039 --> 35:33.858
when he took you in? What?

35:35.154 --> 35:36.986
If it wasn't for him,

35:36.987 --> 35:40.174
you would have ended up
just like that kid out there.

35:40.175 --> 35:41.809
Please?

35:41.810 --> 35:45.326
That boy is not
my responsibility.

35:45.327 --> 35:47.419
Well, maybe he should be,
Leonard.

35:57.801 --> 35:59.695
Thank you.

36:20.768 --> 36:22.003
How's it goin'?

36:22.004 --> 36:24.325
It's goin'.

36:31.639 --> 36:34.099
My wife's ashes.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.729
Trying to figure out
what to do with her.

36:36.730 --> 36:40.147
Yep, mine says
I should quit smokin'.

36:40.148 --> 36:42.080
Wants to call
a marriage counselor

36:42.081 --> 36:43.644
every time I flick a match.

36:43.645 --> 36:46.604
I wanted to...

36:48.268 --> 36:50.291
Wanted to ask you somethin'.

36:53.220 --> 36:55.939
These kids' sneakers,
you sure you saw 'em?

36:55.940 --> 36:59.596
Yeah, I saw 'em. They were red.

36:59.597 --> 37:02.157
High top, low top?
Canvas, leather?

37:02.158 --> 37:04.858
High top, canvas.

37:06.283 --> 37:09.709
What about brand?

37:09.710 --> 37:12.997
You'd have to ask Leonard.
I don't know.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.628
Yeah.

37:15.629 --> 37:18.617
Jigs sure know their sneakers.

37:18.618 --> 37:20.809
Good for tap dancing, too.

37:20.810 --> 37:22.901
Everyone should have one.

37:22.902 --> 37:26.958
Well, now, I didn't mean it
that way.

37:28.622 --> 37:30.823
How d you mean it?

37:30.824 --> 37:32.915
Look...

37:32.916 --> 37:34.939
we're two white guys, right?

37:36.971 --> 37:39.491
I know I am.

37:39.492 --> 37:41.653
You know how it is.

37:41.654 --> 37:44.712
Black kids go missin',
they generally stay missin'.

37:44.713 --> 37:47.512
Except this one didn't
stay missin'.

37:47.513 --> 37:48.907
And now you're telling me
he was wearing sneakers

37:48.908 --> 37:51.199
when my people tell me
he had no feet.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.992
That don't add up.

37:52.993 --> 37:55.882
Maybe Leonard knows something
he ain't telling you.

37:55.883 --> 37:58.143
Something about his uncle?

37:58.144 --> 38:01.571
Maybe nobody cares about that,
it bein' a...

38:01.572 --> 38:03.066
darky problem.

38:03.067 --> 38:04.830
Jesus.

38:12.472 --> 38:15.570
Hanson care, and so do I.

38:15.571 --> 38:17.464
I'll alert the media.

38:47.914 --> 38:49.477
God! No!

38:49.478 --> 38:51.470
No! No! Aah! Don't! No!

38:51.471 --> 38:53.961
Stop!!

38:53.962 --> 38:56.362
Damn.

38:56.363 --> 38:58.654
Shit, and God.

38:58.655 --> 39:00.289
Goddamn!

39:25.886 --> 39:27.410
Gotcha.

40:17.150 --> 40:19.271
There you go.

40:19.272 --> 40:22.031
There you go.

40:22.032 --> 40:23.427
There you go.

41:02.266 --> 41:06.152
Goddamn, boy. Your feet stink.

41:36.073 --> 41:38.036
Leonard Pine?
