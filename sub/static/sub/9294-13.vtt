Season07 Episode13

00:13.680 --> 00:17.020
Mr Burnett you are a
traitor and a terrorist.

00:17.030 --> 00:20.190
Where's the target? Where's the target?

00:21.470 --> 00:23.200
take Mr Bauer away. He's under arrest.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.890
Ha you learned anything
else about the attack?

00:24.930 --> 00:26.930
Renee walker followed a lead on her own.

00:26.970 --> 00:30.620
Got a visual on a heavily armed
commando unit lead by Juma himself.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.690
Bill Buchanan.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.660
Renee walker says the
target is the white house.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.400
Condition red. Secure the president.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.760
There's no safe path out.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.100
We need to secure her in
the first floor lockdown.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.370
hostage rescue tea
are moving into place.

00:48.410 --> 00:51.280
They'll be prepared to storm the
building as soon as the order's given.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.530
Mr Vice president, terrorists
are in control of the white house.

00:54.570 --> 00:58.750
Until you can provide me more
intel on what's going on in there,

00:58.790 --> 01:02.880
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

01:02.890 --> 01:05.400
President Taylor is
locked in the safe room.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.840
What is it I can do for you?

01:06.880 --> 01:09.380
I need you to find me another way in.

01:09.410 --> 01:12.760
Well, I'm looking at the white
house manifest, and according to ts,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.800
Olivia Taylor is presently
in the building with you.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.990
You find Olivia Taylor, and you'll
get the president to open that door.

01:20.030 --> 01:22.650
–President Taylor…
–God, no.

01:22.660 --> 01:29.030
If you don't open the door, I'm going to
cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.

01:30.270 --> 01:31.600
–Open the door.
–Madam president…

01:31.640 --> 01:35.666
–no, open the door. Open the door!
–I can't do that. I can't!

01:35.850 --> 01:37.660
Do you have children, Jack?

01:37.690 --> 01:39.240
I have a daughter.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.950
Could you do what you're asking me to
do? Just stand by and watch her butchered?

01:42.990 --> 01:47.670
No, ma'am, but I am not the
present the United States.

01:47.710 --> 01:52.970
Well, I am the president, and I
am ordering you to open that door.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.420
All right, general, you've got me now.

02:03.450 --> 02:07.120
There's no reason to hold
anyone else. Let them go.

02:15.070 --> 02:19.800
Now, what we do know is that the president was
in the building when the attack took place,

02:19.840 --> 02:24.250
and she may have been taken hostage along
with numerous other white house personnel.

02:24.290 --> 02:29.800
Vice president Hayworth was not in the building,
and we're told he was moved to a secure location.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.770
–The FBI has cordoned off a nine-block perimeter…
–Mr Vice president,

02:33.810 --> 02:34.900
that was agent Moss.

02:34.940 --> 02:35.790
What does he have to say?

02:35.830 --> 02:38.850
He's still requesting that you
authorize a rescue operation.

02:38.890 --> 02:41.010
Does he have any more intel about
what the hell's going on in there?

02:41.050 --> 02:41.930
No, sir.

02:41.980 --> 02:45.430
He deployed two units with deep-band parabolics,
but all they were able to get was static.

02:45.470 --> 02:47.690
They think Juma's using some
kind of jamming equipment.

02:47.730 --> 02:50.360
They've also got spotters at every
possible angle around the building,

02:50.400 --> 02:52.510
but they haven't been able to see inside.

02:52.550 --> 02:54.820
We still don't know whether
Juma has the president,

02:54.860 --> 02:58.040
or whether the president is
locked inside the safe room?

02:58.080 --> 03:00.060
No, sir, we don't.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.170
I will not authorize any action until
I know the status of the president.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.050
Relay that to agent Moss.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.110
Yes, sir.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.428
mom, I know that I hurt you.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.730
I'm so sorry for cutting
you out of my life.

03:20.770 --> 03:23.060
–It's okay…
–no, it isn't.

03:23.390 --> 03:25.970
You were right to
fire me off the campaign.

03:26.010 --> 03:27.960
I felt so betrayed, I
turned my back on you.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.820
Olivia, don't worry about it.

03:29.860 --> 03:32.500
It all seems so stupid now.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.496
I hope you can forgive me.

03:35.530 --> 03:39.150
Darling, I forgave you a long time ago.

03:39.570 --> 03:43.410
Livy, you have to listen to me.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.270
We really are going to be okay.

03:45.310 --> 03:48.500
Just keep your eyes open and be ready.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.010
Abo.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.600
–No, no.
–Get up.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.670
Leave her alone! Get away from her!

03:55.710 --> 03:56.680
Get back!

03:56.720 --> 03:58.400
I said leave her alone! Please!

03:58.440 --> 04:01.220
Olivia, it's okay, darling. It's okay!

04:01.230 --> 04:04.750
Bill, we need to make a move
to try to save the president.

04:04.790 --> 04:05.950
How?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.720
In the lockdown room, there
were five canisters of ch-4.

04:09.770 --> 04:13.830
Before we surrendered ourselves
over to Juma, I opened the valves.

04:13.870 --> 04:17.260
Within the next few minutes, that room
is going to be saturated with natural gas.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.709
It's going to take one
spark to set it off.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.400
I think the explosion is going to be large
enough to take out most of Juma's men.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.670
That's when you can make your move

04:23.710 --> 04:25.030
how do we set it off?

04:25.070 --> 04:28.020
I'll me a run for the lockdown
room. Try and draw their fire.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.520
All we need is one stray bullet.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.000
That's a suicide play, Jack.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.470
We don't have a choice.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.470
Just make sure you can get to the
president and get her out of here.

04:35.510 --> 04:38.150
She knows about the plan; she'll be read

04:38.820 --> 04:41.980
what are you planning? Are
you going to do something?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.710
When it happens, you'll
know about it, senator.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.890
Damn it, if you're planning
something, I want to know what it is.

04:45.930 --> 04:48.170
Senator, shut up.

04:48.180 --> 04:50.270
Read this statement.

04:50.300 --> 04:54.190
It is a confession of your
crimes against my country.

04:54.230 --> 04:59.610
The atrocities that you have committed
will now be seen by the whole world.

05:00.960 --> 05:06.720
I'll read your statement, general, but
I need you to release the other hostages.

05:09.510 --> 05:14.196
You got what you came for. You have
the president of the United States.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.460
As a sign of good faith…

05:18.500 --> 05:21.650
I will release one of the hostages.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.430
You… stand up.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:55.840 --> 06:00.470
do you want me to release any
more hostages, president Taylor?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.720
You son of a bitch.

06:02.760 --> 06:08.480
You will read this statement or I will
do the same thing to everyone here…

06:08.880 --> 06:11.480
starting with your daughter.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.820
General, the uplink is complete.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.750
All right.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.340
The world is waiting, madam president.

06:38.070 --> 06:41.610
“This is the President
of the United States.

06:41.620 --> 06:45.020
”Six hours ago, I ordered our armed forces

06:45.030 --> 06:50.170
”to invade Sangala without
warning and without provocation.

06:50.220 --> 06:54.930
”This attack was a criminal act
motivated solely by America's desire

06:54.980 --> 06:57.760
to exert its power and influence.”

06:57.800 --> 06:59.600
Tell me you're shutting this down.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.090
We can't, sir. It's a live
feed straight to the internet.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.930
I don't care. Shut it down.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.810
It's going out on multiple servers, sir.

07:05.850 --> 07:08.424
It would take hours just to trace them.

07:10.050 --> 07:12.880
this is Derek watt hold on.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.388
–Sir, it's agent Moss on teleconference.
–Put him on.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.290
–Sir, are you getting this?
–Yes.

07:20.330 --> 07:22.110
So is the rest of the damn world.

07:22.150 --> 07:27.760
Mr Vice president, I believe Juma came here to
humiliate the president and
stage a public execution.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.640
We have a rescue operation in place.
All we need is your authorization.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.590
You don't know what
Juma's intentions are.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.210
This could be a prelude
to a set of demands.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.440
There are no demands here,
sir. This is about revenge.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.670
Juma knows he'll never get
out of the white house alive.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.290
You're speculating, agent Moss.

07:41.330 --> 07:46.460
My advisors are telling me the most prudent
course of action is to try to initiate
communication with Juma.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.770
We've been trying to do
that. He hasn't responded.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.380
Sir, Juma has no desire
to negotiate anything.

07:51.420 --> 07:52.750
Hes going to kill the president.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.780
Sir, we have a tactical plan in place.

07:54.820 --> 07:58.440
It's a two-pronged assault,
and we're confident that
it stands a good chance of
catching Juma off guard,

07:58.480 --> 08:01.290
but we're losing time.
We have to initiate now.

08:01.330 --> 08:05.080
I cannot authorize any action at might
result in the president's death.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.840
Keep trying to open dialogue with Juma.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.930
Hold your position till
you're told otherwise.

08:08.970 --> 08:10.840
I will keep this feed open.

08:10.880 --> 08:15.950
“General Juma has demonstrated that
even a tyrant state like the U.S…”

08:15.960 --> 08:16.850
be ready.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.540
Jack, listen to me.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.920
Juma's not solely
coordinating this attack.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.930
What do you mean?

08:21.970 --> 08:23.910
I heard him talking on his sat phone.

08:23.950 --> 08:27.360
He's coordinating with someone on the
outside. They were giving him real-time intel.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.030
You think it's someone
in the white house?

08:29.070 --> 08:30.830
I don't know.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.368
But even if we take Juma down, the
president may still be in danger.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.294
You're the only one I
know who can do this, Jack.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.540
Find out who Juma's working with.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.510
Agent Moss, a device has been
detonated in the west wing.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.090
Mr Vice president, there's been
an explosion at the white house.

09:01.130 --> 09:02.660
–An explosion?
–Yes, sir.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.330
The president's internet
feed has gone dark.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.470
We saw that. What's happening?

09:05.510 --> 09:08.200
I don't know, sir, but we're going
in under my authority. Let's go.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.040
–That is not your decision.
–All teams, attack plan delta.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.010
Agent Moss, you're
under orders! Agent Moss!

09:12.050 --> 09:13.800
Code green.

09:15.190 --> 09:17.810
Go, go, go, go!

09:23.270 --> 09:25.960
pierce, get to the president!

09:31.900 --> 09:34.270
Madam president, are you okay?

09:34.290 --> 09:39.504
We need get out of here right now. Both
of you, me with me. Let's go. This way.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.250
madam president, get down.

09:53.290 --> 09:55.850
Stay low till I know we're clear.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.620
Ngozi…

09:59.650 --> 10:04.200
kill the hostages.
The president is mine!

10:05.750 --> 10:08.660
Udo… Udo?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.400
No, no, no, no!

10:17.380 --> 10:20.900
Don't move! Don't you move!

10:37.650 --> 10:40.630
clear. We're clear!

10:42.030 --> 10:44.930
Secret service! I have the president!

10:45.540 --> 10:49.230
Aaron Pierce, secret
service. Let's go, ma'am.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.500
madam president, this way!

11:07.160 --> 11:09.120
We have the president.
The president is secure!

11:09.160 --> 11:12.262
Repeat: we have the
president. This way, ma'am.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.980
Renee! We gotta get the president
out of here now! This way, ma'am.

11:24.020 --> 11:27.340
It's all right, darling.
It's gonna be all right.

12:01.870 --> 12:03.900
Madam president…

12:04.460 --> 12:05.630
we're still sweeping the west wing.

12:05.670 --> 12:08.400
But we do believe all the
hostiles have been accounted for.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.000
Now you and your daughter will stay here
until we finish securing the building.

12:11.040 --> 12:11.850
I understand.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.850
Now once we get the all clear, we're going
to move you to Andrews air force base.

12:14.890 --> 12:17.030
No, I'm staying right here.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.700
Ma'am, it's for your own safety.

12:18.740 --> 12:22.940
Do what's necessary to make sure this
building's safe because I'm not going anywhere.

12:22.980 --> 12:26.780
The American people need to know that
the president is in the white house.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.050
Yes, madam president.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.990
How many people did we lose?

12:31.030 --> 12:32.750
It's too early to tell.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.030
Medical teams are on their
way to treat the wounded.

12:35.070 --> 12:37.720
We're going to set up a
triage unit in the east wing.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.230
All right.

12:39.270 --> 12:42.710
I'd like to speak to the vice
president as soon as possible.

12:42.750 --> 12:43.600
Yes, ma'am.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.680
And I need to know
how my husband's doing.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.220
Would you please contact Dr Lee
Schulman at west Arlington hospital?

12:50.250 --> 12:52.690
–Yes, madam president.
–Thank you.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.580
How's agent pierce?

13:03.600 --> 13:06.190
They said he's gonna be okay.

13:08.810 --> 13:11.320
What about you?

13:14.390 --> 13:17.150
I'm not sure.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.220
I still can't believe this happened.

13:21.230 --> 13:24.330
I thought they were
gonna kill all of us.

13:24.340 --> 13:27.490
I was so scared.

13:30.680 --> 13:35.060
It's over… and we're safe…

13:36.130 --> 13:39.190
thanks to a lot of brave people.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.920
Excuse me, madam president, the
vice president is on a secure line.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.160
I'll be right there.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.700
Did you mean what you said
about putting the past behind us?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.130
Of course I meant it.

13:58.150 --> 14:01.290
I don't ever want to lose you again.

14:02.630 --> 14:05.060
You won't.

14:47.090 --> 14:51.380
The president's safe, Jack. She's
in the residence. She's secure.

14:54.470 --> 14:57.200
I'm so sorry, Jack.

14:57.580 --> 15:00.660
I know that he was our friend.

15:00.670 --> 15:03.240
It was supposed to be me.

15:05.900 --> 15:11.048
I was supposed to set off the explosion
so that he could secure the president.

15:15.060 --> 15:18.000
He died protecting his country.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.820
Yeah.

15:29.310 --> 15:32.820
This isn't over yet. Agent Moss…

15:36.110 --> 15:38.980
Juma and his men were not working alone.

15:38.990 --> 15:39.860
What are you talking about?

15:39.900 --> 15:44.100
When I was in the lockdown with the president,
Bill said he heard Juma talking on a sat phone.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.600
Said he was getting real-time
intel from someone on the outside.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.920
–Who?
–I don't know.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.470
The point is, I don't think this threat is
over, and I don't think the president is safe.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.820
You sure Buchanan heard this right?

15:57.160 --> 15:59.000
And right now the only lead
we've got is Ryan Burnett.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.330
He knew about the attack on the white house, and
chances are, he's gonna know
who Juma was talking to.

16:03.370 --> 16:05.010
All right, all right, I'll talk to him.

16:05.050 --> 16:08.730
No, the president already offered
him immunity. He turned it down.

16:08.770 --> 16:13.050
He's not gonna tell you
anything, but he will talk to me.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.780
Why is that, Jack,
'cause you tortured him?

16:14.820 --> 16:17.800
I don't need to touch him. I just need him
to think I'm there to finish what I started.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.866
And I promise you he will tell
us everything we need to know.

16:21.960 --> 16:26.830
Larry, please, the last thing Bill asked for
before he died was for me to follow this through.

16:26.870 --> 16:29.260
I owe him that.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.970
Look, I give you my word.
I will not touch Burnett.

16:32.010 --> 16:34.010
Jack, look, I understand
about your friend, I do,

16:34.050 --> 16:36.490
but I got standing orders from the
president to take you into custody.

16:36.530 --> 16:39.430
I gotta get you back to FBI, but I
promise you I'll look into this, all right?

16:39.470 --> 16:42.160
Agent Powell, handcuff Mr Bauer.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.720
Take him down to staging area B.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.930
Sir, put your hands on top of your head.

16:45.970 --> 16:47.010
Larry…

16:47.020 --> 16:48.960
if you're gonna tell me he's right
about this I don't want to hear it.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.710
Yes, that's the problem. You're
not listening to what he's saying.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.820
When are you gonna
stop defending this guy?

16:52.860 --> 16:55.180
I'm not defending him,
I'm defending a good idea.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.560
I just said I will look into this!

16:57.580 --> 17:00.880
Now do your job: finish
locking down the building.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.109
Agent Reynolds.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.400
I need to speak with the
president. It's urgent.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.130
She's in a secure location. You'll
need to go through Ethan Kanin.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.619
–Where is he?
–He just arrived.

17:22.660 --> 17:25.762
–He's on his way to see the president.
–Thanks.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.920
The president's in the
residence with her daughter.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.810
They've both been checked over
and they're in good condition.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.880
Thank God.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.910
I want a conference with the secnav and
the joint chiefs as soon as possible.

17:36.950 --> 17:38.920
We're routing all White
House communications to the residence,

17:38.960 --> 17:40.570
and we're setting up a
temporary command post.

17:40.610 --> 17:42.650
Good.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.620
Mr Kanin, I need to speak with you.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.860
I'm on my way to see the president.

17:45.900 --> 17:49.650
Yes, I know, sir, but it's extremely
urgent. It'll only take a few moments.

17:49.690 --> 17:52.830
all right. What is it, agent walker?

17:52.840 --> 17:55.900
Some new intel has just come to our attention
and we need to act on it immediately.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.690
I tried to reach the president,
but I couldn't get through.

17:57.730 --> 17:58.530
I'm listening.

17:58.570 --> 18:01.020
Sir, the threat to the
president may not be over.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.980
We've reason to believe that
general Juma was not acting alone.

18:04.020 --> 18:09.894
Before Bill Buchanan died, he saw general
Juma communicating with someone on a sat phone.

18:11.250 --> 18:16.370
At this point, we can confirm that FBI
agents entered the White House moments ago,

18:16.410 --> 18:18.950
and there were reports
of sustained gunfire.

18:18.990 --> 18:22.510
It appears that authorities are
now in control of the west wing,

18:22.550 --> 18:27.410
and we are expecting word from our FBI
source of the status of the hostages.

18:27.450 --> 18:28.990
While there has been
no official comment…

18:29.030 --> 18:31.270
so what have we got?

18:31.280 --> 18:33.750
The president's alive.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.900
Are you sure?

18:35.930 --> 18:39.010
We've been monitoring interagency
servers. Word just went out.

18:39.050 --> 18:41.810
Juma's dead, Taylor survived.

18:42.470 --> 18:44.252
What happened do you think?

18:44.270 --> 18:48.032
We don't know any details
yet, but we'll keep monitoring.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.860
well…

18:52.870 --> 18:55.540
you gotta admire the damn bitch.

18:55.580 --> 18:56.960
She doesn't give up easily.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.950
I'm sorry, sir. We, uh, just didn't
have enough control over the situation.

19:02.450 --> 19:05.760
Greg, you look tense.

19:06.490 --> 19:09.050
Do me a favor.

19:09.060 --> 19:12.280
Have a drink, relax.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.780
Juma held up his part of the bargain.

19:18.820 --> 19:23.920
We're getting what we wanted. As far as
I'm concerned, everything's still on track.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.270
where are the weapons now?

19:26.300 --> 19:30.570
A shipment should ready for
pickup in the next couple of hours.

19:30.580 --> 19:33.290
Good. Get Chapman on the phone.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.320
I want to nail down some targets.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.490
Sir, the chopper you
requested is on its way.

19:52.530 --> 19:55.430
It'll be here in ten minutes. You'll
be escorting Mr Bauer back to FBI.

19:55.470 --> 19:58.308
–Hold him in the command center.
–Yes, sir.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.690
–This is Larry Moss.
–This is Ethan Kanin.

20:04.730 --> 20:07.680
I understand you're taking
Jack Bauer back to FBI?

20:07.720 --> 20:10.640
Yes, sir. He's gonna be debriefed
and remanded into federal custody.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.430
–I want you to put that on hold.
–Sir?

20:13.810 --> 20:15.420
I just spoke with agent walker.

20:15.460 --> 20:18.560
She told me Juma may have been
working with someone on the outside,

20:18.600 --> 20:22.362
and that there may be an
ongoing threat to the president.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.600
Yes, that's true.

20:25.610 --> 20:29.520
I want you to send Jack Bauer
to question Ryan Burnett.

20:31.350 --> 20:32.430
Agent Moss?

20:32.460 --> 20:34.920
Sir, I think that's a mistake.

20:34.950 --> 20:39.080
Yes, agent walker shared your concerns
with me, and I've given this some thought.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.850
If Burnett does know who
Juma was working with,

20:41.890 --> 20:45.200
Bauer's approach may be our best
chance to get that information.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.850
With respect, sir, Bauer
almost killed this man.

20:47.890 --> 20:52.880
I was there, agent Moss, but this
will be a controlled interrogation.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.190
We're gonna play on Burnett's fears.

20:55.230 --> 20:58.450
Bauer's presence alone should be
enough to intimidate him into talking.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.820
Sir, Bauer is a Id card.

20:59.860 --> 21:02.340
We have no idea what he'll do when
he gets in that room with Burnett.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.500
I realize there's a risk.

21:04.540 --> 21:08.660
That's why you're going to do this under
my authority and my authority alone.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.640
You're not taking this to the president?

21:10.680 --> 21:16.210
No. If something does go wrong, I want
to make sure the president is protected.

21:16.710 --> 21:20.380
With respect, sir, I think you're not telling the
president 'cause you know she'd never allow this.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.930
You've made your objections
clear, agent Moss.

21:22.970 --> 21:25.700
I'm not going to debate this with U.

21:25.730 --> 21:31.270
I want you to take Bauer to question Burnett.
That's a direct order. Do you understand?

21:31.310 --> 21:32.250
I understand.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.770
And I'm counting on you to supervise
every second of that interrogation.

21:35.810 --> 21:38.050
I'll expect a full report
as soon as you're done.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.320
Yes, sir.

21:45.640 --> 21:50.100
I want to speak personally to the families
of everyone we lost tonight, so…

21:50.140 --> 21:53.030
Keep me informed as they're notified.

21:53.060 --> 21:55.120
Absolutely, madam president.

21:55.130 --> 21:58.180
And the minute Angela nelson gets
here, send her straight up to me.

21:58.220 --> 22:02.100
We need to start working on
the speech to the country.

22:02.130 --> 22:04.310
Of course, madam president.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.890
Patrick, you have just been
through a terrible ordeal.

22:12.370 --> 22:14.970
Are you sure you're okay?

22:15.010 --> 22:17.050
I'll be fine.

22:17.090 --> 22:19.980
It helps to focus on work.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.540
I understand.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.870
Thank you, Patrick.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.550
thank God you're all right.

22:38.430 --> 22:40.860
How you feeling?

22:41.430 --> 22:45.550
like I just woke up from a
nightmare. It was unbelievable, Ethan.

22:45.590 --> 22:48.610
I can't even imagine it. How's Olivia?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.770
She's shaken up, but
she's going to be okay.

22:51.810 --> 22:53.250
I'm glad to hear it.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.340
We lost some good people tonight, Ethan.

22:55.380 --> 22:58.150
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

22:58.190 --> 23:03.840
I'm thinking about bringing
Olivia on as a special advisor.

23:04.920 --> 23:10.010
Madam president, I can
understand your not wanting to
be separated from your daughter
after what's happened.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.920
Especially after what's happened,
we need people who can do the job.

23:12.960 --> 23:18.600
I'm not disputing Olivia's competence,
but she's also a political liability.

23:18.610 --> 23:21.600
Nobody's forgotten what
she did during the campaign,

23:21.640 --> 23:25.200
leaking damaging personal information
about your opponent to the press.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.050
Olivia knows what she did was wrong.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.730
She almost cost you the election.

23:28.770 --> 23:31.160
She's changed.

23:31.170 --> 23:34.990
We talked about it, Ethan, and she
is accepting full responsibility.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.710
She has learned from her mistakes.

23:38.940 --> 23:41.590
I'm willing to put the past
behind us so we can move ahead.

23:41.630 --> 23:42.750
I still think it's a mistake.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.690
I don't care what you think!

23:52.240 --> 23:54.240
I am so sorry, Ethan.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.750
You know I don't mean that.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.230
But I've made up my mind.

23:59.270 --> 24:02.340
I want Olivia to join my administration.

24:02.550 --> 24:04.990
And I want it to come from you.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.870
Me?

24:06.910 --> 24:12.058
Your offering her this position would
be a good way to extend an olive branch.

24:13.720 --> 24:17.490
I need the two of you to make peace.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.670
All right, madam president.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.430
I'll talk to her.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.660
Thank you, Ethan.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.890
I understand agent walker
was trying to reach me.

24:29.910 --> 24:31.480
That's right, but I spoke to her.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.640
What did she want?

24:32.680 --> 24:36.970
Just some procedural matters,
madam president. I took care of it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.190
Larry, you wanted to see me?

25:12.610 --> 25:15.720
I just got off the
phone with Ethan Kanin.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.900
Look, I didn't want to go behind your
back, but you didn't leave me any choice.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.660
I didn't leave you A…

25:24.700 --> 25:26.660
How about you choose to follow orders?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.990
–I'm sorry, Larry.
–No. I don't think you are.

25:29.030 --> 25:32.560
Larry, I've seen Jack do
some terrible things today.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.690
Things that I still can't justify.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.750
But he has been right every
time. And you know what?

25:36.790 --> 25:39.220
I can't help but think that maybe
if we had just stayed out of his way,

25:39.260 --> 25:41.438
none of this would have happened.

25:42.210 --> 25:45.010
Look, I am sorry that I went
behind your back, but I…

25:45.050 --> 25:49.868
I promise you this play with Burnett
will go down just the way Jack says.

25:52.010 --> 25:55.410
If you think you're going with
Bauer, you are out of your mind.

25:55.450 --> 25:59.450
You may have gotten a white house order,
but I'm still running this operation.

25:59.490 --> 26:04.610
I'll take Bauer to see Burnett.
You're going back to FBI.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.670
I want you to clean out your
office and hand in your badge.

26:08.710 --> 26:11.020
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.790
Okay. I know that you're upset
Larry, but this isn't over.

26:13.830 --> 26:15.510
You're going to need me.

26:15.550 --> 26:19.774
What I need are people that I
can trust. I thought that was you.

26:44.190 --> 26:47.060
Look, you may think you got what you
wanted, getting Renee to go behind my back,

26:47.100 --> 26:50.150
but Ethan Kanin ordered me
to I you question Burnett.

26:50.190 --> 26:52.340
I'm going to be watching you
every second you're in there.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.020
You do one thing I don't like,
you're finished. You understand me?

26:55.060 --> 26:57.200
Understood.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.980
You should leave Renée out of this.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.840
She was just doing what
she thought was right.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.580
Yeah? Well, she may lose her job over it.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.390
She's the best agent you've got.

27:06.430 --> 27:10.126
She circumvented my authority.
I can't just ignore that.

27:10.620 --> 27:12.150
I've known this woman for nine years,

27:12.190 --> 27:17.470
and I've never seen her do the kind of
things she's done in the last nine hours.

27:38.350 --> 27:41.550
We've narrowed the list down to 12
targets along the eastern seaboard.

27:41.590 --> 27:43.670
They're all within 300
kilometers of the base.

27:43.710 --> 27:44.920
How many people?

27:44.950 --> 27:47.200
10,000 to 15,000 in each target zone.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.520
And our kill ratio would be what?

27:49.560 --> 27:52.210
Well, we've chosen these areas
for maximum population density,

27:52.250 --> 27:54.410
so the ratio could be as high as 80%.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.970
Let's hope we never have to find out.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.330
Get these coordinates down
to the boys in tac-ops.

27:59.370 --> 28:01.240
Have them start programming them in.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.050
Yes, sir.

28:07.600 --> 28:11.220
We just intercepted a
flash memo from the FBI.

28:11.970 --> 28:16.330
Jack Bauer is on his way to Kennedy
memorial hospital to question Burnett.

28:16.370 --> 28:18.280
Bauer was arrested.
How is this possible?

28:18.320 --> 28:23.470
There was an executive order from the
white house giving Bauer access to Burnett.

28:23.510 --> 28:26.390
Bauer will finish what he started.
Burnett will tell him everything.

28:26.430 --> 28:28.110
No, he won't, sir.

28:28.150 --> 28:31.890
I have already sent somebody to
the hospital to deal with Burnett.

28:31.930 --> 28:34.540
He can take care of
Bauer at the same time.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.130
–Who did you send?
–Quinn.

28:38.140 --> 28:41.450
Quinn's good. Bauer's good, too.

28:42.670 --> 28:44.870
Agent Moss, we've locked
down the entire floor.

28:44.910 --> 28:47.730
We equipped Burnett's room with
two cameras and audio surveillance.

28:47.770 --> 28:49.030
Where is he?

28:49.070 --> 28:52.360
Down the hall. It's going to be a
moment. Doctor has to revive him.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.180
Why? What happened?

28:54.190 --> 28:57.900
He was given a heavy sedative. He was
in pretty bad shape when he got here.

28:57.940 --> 29:01.360
Dr Wyndam, special agent
Larry Moss, Jack Bauer.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.090
I understand you're here
to interrogate my patient.

29:03.130 --> 29:03.780
That's right.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.480
Well, he's still recovering
from his last interrogation,

29:05.520 --> 29:07.700
so if you're here to brutalize
him again, I won't be party to it.

29:07.740 --> 29:10.380
Doctor, your patient was involved in a
terrorist attack against the White House

29:10.420 --> 29:12.760
in an effort to kill the
president of the United States,

29:12.800 --> 29:15.940
and I believe the people he's working with want
to try it again, so if you've got a problem…

29:15.980 --> 29:17.830
we won't harm him, doctor.

29:17.860 --> 29:22.744
This will be a controlled interrogation.
Please, we need your cooperation.

29:26.750 --> 29:30.776
It's going to take him a couple
of minutes to come out of it.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.210
Who are you?

30:13.220 --> 30:15.740
I'm a friend. What's your name?

30:15.750 --> 30:17.190
–Robert.
–Robert?

30:17.200 --> 30:20.080
–Yeah.
–You're recovering from heart surgery?

30:20.120 --> 30:21.760
Yeah.

30:22.090 --> 30:23.920
Do you have a wife, Robert?

30:24.780 --> 30:26.000
No. She passed away.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.700
–Children? Grandchildren?
–No.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.600
What about this man? Does he have family?

30:35.520 --> 30:38.310
Yeah. Lots of grandkids.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.350
Make a hell of a noise when they visit.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.840
how's your arm?

33:14.880 --> 33:17.680
I should be back on my
feet in a couple of hours.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.950
And you, ma'am?

33:18.980 --> 33:22.478
Oh, it's nothing a little
aspirin won't take care of.

33:23.830 --> 33:26.730
I want to thank you for what you did.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.750
You took a bullet for
me. You saved my life.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.440
There is no need to thank me, ma'am.

33:32.460 --> 33:35.270
Right, you were just doing your job.

33:35.310 --> 33:39.220
Only in this case, it wasn't really your
job since you retired four years ago.

33:39.260 --> 33:41.760
Yes, ma'am, that's true.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.940
Do you mind if I ask you why?

33:46.610 --> 33:49.600
Did it have to do with Martha Logan?

33:50.520 --> 33:53.690
Martha and I were… close.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.250
It must have been hard for
you— what happened to her.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.330
I'd prefer not to talk about it.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.450
I'm sorry.

34:01.460 --> 34:04.530
You don't have to apologize.

34:07.260 --> 34:09.420
I hope you won't be a
stranger, agent pierce.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.710
Thank you.

34:11.719 --> 34:15.530
And, uh… it's Aaron.

34:17.800 --> 34:21.719
Okay, Aaron. You get some rest.

34:23.889 --> 34:27.210
I'd like to head back to the
residence now if that's okay?

34:27.250 --> 34:30.699
Olivia… I was just coming to see you.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.510
I'm glad you're all right.

34:33.540 --> 34:35.250
Thank you.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.900
You have a moment to talk?

34:36.940 --> 34:38.860
Sure.

34:47.409 --> 34:49.710
the blunt fact of the matter is…

34:49.739 --> 34:55.610
this administration has just suffered
some terrible losses, and we need help.

34:56.250 --> 35:02.784
The president and I would like you to consider
coming on board as special
advisor to the president.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.920
I, uh…

35:07.250 --> 35:09.430
I have to say I'm a little surprised.

35:09.470 --> 35:12.520
–Surprised?
–Oh, that you'd sign off on this.

35:12.530 --> 35:16.160
You mother said she's ready
to put the past behind her…

35:16.370 --> 35:18.410
and so am I.

35:19.400 --> 35:23.426
I overstepped my bounds during
the campaign, and I was wrong.

35:23.950 --> 35:25.550
I'm glad you see it that way.

35:25.590 --> 35:28.626
But it's not the past
that concerns me, Ethan.

35:29.320 --> 35:35.392
It's what's happening right now, and what's
been happening ever since my mother took office.

35:35.590 --> 35:36.560
Excuse me?

35:36.600 --> 35:39.280
Do you think any of this would have
happened if my mother had a chief advisor

35:39.320 --> 35:42.760
who knew what the hell was
going on in her administration?

35:42.800 --> 35:44.320
What are you talking about?

35:44.360 --> 35:49.470
R government was corrupted on every level,
and it all happened right under your nose.

35:49.510 --> 35:54.310
Even you have to admit, it's an
unconscionable failure on your part.

35:56.380 --> 36:00.406
Frankly, I'm surprised you
haven't tendered your resignation.

36:00.560 --> 36:03.870
You have no right to
speak to me that way.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.080
You don't know what you're talking about.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.340
You don't have the facts.

36:08.370 --> 36:10.970
I intend to get the facts.

36:11.290 --> 36:13.930
I'm going to find out
exactly who failed my mother,

36:13.970 --> 36:19.448
and I am going to make sure that that
person never is in a position to do it again.

36:22.350 --> 36:24.780
Excuse me.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.840
okay, let's go.

36:46.070 --> 36:49.700
I'll be watching. You lay one
finger on him, it's over.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.940
Right.

37:22.090 --> 37:24.210
–He's coming around.
–Good.

37:43.610 --> 37:45.720
Wake up.

37:46.110 --> 37:48.550
Wake up.

37:53.010 --> 37:55.550
Remember me?

37:57.730 --> 38:00.070
Oh, my God.

38:01.270 --> 38:03.340
What the hell are you doing here?

38:03.380 --> 38:05.180
I've just come from the White House.

38:05.220 --> 38:06.840
Juma's attack failed.

38:06.870 --> 38:08.530
He's dead, and so are his men.

38:08.570 --> 38:12.150
A lot of innocent people
died today. Good people.

38:12.160 --> 38:15.010
Including a friend of mine— Bill
Buchanan. You might have met him.

38:15.050 --> 38:16.820
You stay the hell away from me.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.880
And I want to talk
to a lawyer right now.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.940
Do you hear me? I want
to talk to a lawyer!

38:20.980 --> 38:22.700
Somebody get me the hell out of here!

38:22.740 --> 38:26.238
You're not going anywhere.
It's just you and me, pal.

38:26.430 --> 38:28.670
Did you really think you were
going to get away with it?

38:28.710 --> 38:31.350
Somebody please, help me!

38:31.360 --> 38:34.450
You're wasting your breath.
They're not coming for you.

38:34.490 --> 38:37.540
Please don't hurt me. I'll
tell you anything you want.

38:37.580 --> 38:40.560
Do you hear that— I'm ready to talk.
I'll tell you anything you want to know!

38:40.600 --> 38:43.410
Just get him out of
here! I'm ready to talk!

38:43.450 --> 38:46.330
They're done talking to
you. That's why they sent me.

38:46.370 --> 38:50.528
Please, you can't do this! You
have no right! This isn't legal!

38:51.350 --> 38:53.390
–what happened?
–I don't know.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.832
Looks like we lost the
sound feed. Give me a second.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.710
There are no laws in here, Mr Burnett.

39:00.750 --> 39:04.360
You aided and abetted terrorists, who then tried
to kill the president of the United States.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.000
now you have to answer for that.

39:07.020 --> 39:08.550
The rules don't apply to you anymore.

39:08.590 --> 39:10.780
No, please, please, you
can't let him touch me!

39:10.820 --> 39:13.790
–Please, you can't let him do this…
–Shut up!

39:17.080 --> 39:19.654
it could be a glitch in the trunk line.

40:16.340 --> 40:17.950
damn it, fix the thing!

40:17.980 --> 40:19.850
I'm trying, sir.

40:42.970 --> 40:45.290
–Bauer?
–He jammed the electronic bolt.

40:45.330 --> 40:47.310
–Is there another way in?
–No.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.630
Jack! Jack!

40:50.640 --> 40:53.140
Damn it, Bauer, open the door!

41:15.880 --> 41:17.560
have security lock down the hospital.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.370
I want a high-priority
APB issued for Jack Bauer.

41:20.410 --> 41:22.730
All agencies.

41:55.770 --> 41:58.490
–It's done.
–Good. Thank you.

42:00.560 --> 42:04.880
It's done. Burnett's dead.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.070
And Bauer?

42:06.110 --> 42:07.890
They'll think he killed Burnett.

42:07.930 --> 42:10.768
So, nobody will know
that we were involved.

42:12.210 --> 42:14.640
–Good.
–Yeah.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.590
Now 're having some fun.

42:20.010 --> 42:21.160
Agent Moss.

42:21.190 --> 42:22.760
Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.

42:22.800 --> 42:23.900
Where are you?

42:23.930 --> 42:25.510
I didn't kill Burnett. I'm being set up.

42:25.550 --> 42:26.520
Set up?

42:26.550 --> 42:28.800
A man released some kind
of nerve agent into the room.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.370
It immobilized me. He came through
the ceiling and killed Burnett.

42:31.410 --> 42:33.820
I swear to you, I'm not
lying. I watched him do it.

42:33.860 --> 42:35.510
Get back in here, we'll work this out.

42:35.550 --> 42:36.830
I can't, you know that.

42:36.870 --> 42:37.990
You can if you're innocent.

42:38.030 --> 42:40.770
Look, there is a reason why they
wanted me framed and didn't kill me.

42:40.810 --> 42:44.430
They're trying to keep you distracted by dealing
with him so they can finish what they started.

42:44.470 --> 42:48.364
Don't let them get away with
this. This threat is not over.

42:49.210 --> 42:51.300
Jack…

42:51.950 --> 42:53.740
Jack?

42:55.430 --> 42:57.200
Damn it!
