Previously on Beauty and the Beast:

This matters to me.
You matter to me.

BARNETT:
People are dying.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.443
Somehow, somebody
is getting ordinary people

00:10.600 --> 00:12.170
to do extraordinary things.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.209
Things that nobody
should be able to do.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.250
We have to stop whoever's behind this
before someone else gets hurt.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.165
- So you're the ones they're looking for.
- Who are you talking about?

00:20.320 --> 00:21.765
Smile.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.927
CATHERINE:
Who'd do that to somebody?

00:25.080 --> 00:27.401
I don't know.
Whoever it is, they just made us.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.403
We're screwed.
The experiments were bad enough,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.801
but now that there are targets
on our backs, I don't know.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.008
Are you ready to do this?
Get married?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.049
That could've left a mark.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.121
Would've served you right.
Why are you sneaking up on me?

01:03.280 --> 01:05.931
I whistled. Didn't you hear me whistle?
It's our code, right?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.526
Codes. We shouldn't need codes.
We should be getting married,

01:08.680 --> 01:10.808
planning our honeymoon,
not running for our lives.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.406
We're not running for our lives.
We're just...

01:13.560 --> 01:15.847
We're buying time, okay?
Until we can figure out how 10--

01:16.000 --> 01:18.844
- Stop a superhuman assassin?
- Yeah, that.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.288
We've been on the run for three days,
and somehow he keeps finding us.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.364
- It's not looking good.
- Well, he hasn't gotten us yet, has he?

01:26.240 --> 01:28.641
Yeah? Because he jumped through
a stained-glass window

01:28.800 --> 01:31.849
- and landed like a cat.
- Mm-hm. I can do that too.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.402
- He has superhuman strength.
- Well, I have super-beast strength.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.927
Bullets can't even stop him.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.081
He's got me there.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.641
This isn't a joke, Vincent.
We're not moving forward.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.802
We're moving backward.
We're living in the shadows,

01:45.960 --> 01:49.487
- just like you used to.
- Yes, until you rescued me, right?

01:49.640 --> 01:52.564
Yeah, but now we have to
rescue each other.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.291
Whoever is behind these experiments
knows who we are now.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.851
That doesn't just put us in danger,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.321
it puts everyone we care about
in danger too.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.643
Which means he's not gonna stop
coming after us until he succeeds.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.243
Which is why we gotta put our focus
back on whoever sent the guy, okay?

02:06.400 --> 02:09.006
Cut the head off the snake,
stop them before they stop us,

02:09.160 --> 02:10.525
so we can finally get married.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.968
That's if you still want to get married.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.487
No, of course I want to get married.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.087
I love you, Vincent. You know that.

02:22.240 --> 02:27.565
It's just sometimes I wonder
if it's ever really gonna happen.

HAMLIN:
This is Detective Hamlin.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.120
Please, don't touch my things.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.406
That includes my gummy worms.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.807
- Forbes.
- Hey, uh, can you talk?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.485
Can you believe this guy?

02:50.640 --> 02:53.086
- You on a burner phone?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.810
What's going on? Any problems?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.440
No, I like having roommates again.
It's so not private.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.204
<i>Protective custody sucks.</i>

02:59.360 --> 03:01.283
I'm sorry, J.T.
We just can't take any chances.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.930
Not for you, Tess, Heather...

03:03.080 --> 03:06.004
I know, I know,
but I don't have to like it, do I?

03:06.160 --> 03:08.481
This is not the cop I want
to be sleeping with,

03:08.640 --> 03:09.641
if you know what I mean.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.722
Okay, well, as soon as we find out
who's behind these experiments,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.450
the sooner we can get on
with our lives.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.284
Any progress?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.920
I ran genome sequencing on some
of the outbreak victims,

03:20.080 --> 03:21.809
the ones that were enhanced
by the parasite.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.769
<i>- Okay And'?
- I identified</i>

03:23.920 --> 03:25.490
trace amounts of methyl aldehyde

03:25.640 --> 03:28.120
in the delivery system,
AKA formaldehyde.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.169
Okay, I don't understand.
How does that help?

03:30.320 --> 03:33.085
Distribution is highly regulated,
so not many labs are gonna have it.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.846
So if we can find the lab,
we can figure out who's behind this.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.844
Yeah, someone's gotta be making
these highly complex serums, right?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.243
<i>- How many labs, J. T.?
- Uh, around 200.</i>

03:42.400 --> 03:45.131
Two hundred. Are you kidding me,
man? You gotta narrow it down.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.203
Hey, give me a break.
Don't you think I'm trying?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.362
I don't have the processing capacity
to do it here,

03:49.520 --> 03:52.649
and I can't very well sneak off
to the university towing bodyguards.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.325
Okay, I'm sorry, man. I'm just...

03:54.480 --> 03:56.687
I'm frustrated,
and I'm hungry, and I'm cold.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.286
It's okay. I understand.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.525
Wait. Wait, doesn't the hospital
have supercomputers?

04:03.680 --> 04:04.920
Yeah, they do.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.651
But how are you gonna get in
without somebody noticing?

04:07.840 --> 04:10.002
<i>Especially the guy
who's trying to kill you.</i>

04:10.600 --> 04:12.204
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.047
Hello? Vincent?

04:21.320 --> 04:22.810
<i>You there?</i>

04:25.560 --> 04:27.050
<i>Vincent?</i>

04:29.200 --> 04:33.171
Hello? Vincent?

04:39.560 --> 04:41.927
- What have we got?
- Chemical accident, third-degree burns.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.082
- OR's prepped and waiting.
- What? On whose order?

04:44.240 --> 04:46.402
- Dr. Keller's.
- Oh, Keller. Okay, fifth floor.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.245
Thank you. Fifth floor, gentlemen.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.610
Clear.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.044
All right, I owe you guys. Thanks.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.646
No way. You saved my son, doc.
You guys gonna be all right?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.211
Yeah, we'll be okay.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.362
All right, take it easy, guys.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.931
Let's go.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.209
Okay.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.523
Okay, hopefully I can access
the mainframe from here,

05:24.680 --> 05:27.889
cross it over to J.T. off-site,
so he can narrow down the list of labs.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.088
Okay, I found a candy bar
and an apple.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.527
Living the dream. I'll take the apple.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.250
Oh, okay, here.

05:36.560 --> 05:41.691
- Any, uh, clean clothes in there?
- Yeah, scrubs. Blue.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.611
And hibiscus pink.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.970
- No wedding dress or tux, by chance?
- No, sorry.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.726
You know, J.T. was right.
I mean, there are so many labs,

05:50.880 --> 05:53.201
this is gonna take days
to narrow down.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.727
Yeah, we don't have days.
Neither do our friends and family.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.963
- Tess can't protect them forever.
- So, what are you suggesting?

05:59.120 --> 06:02.488
I'm suggesting that we stop running.
That we leave town.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.291
I hate to break it to you, but
the assassin will keep following us.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.125
Right, and if we draw him out,
at least everyone else will be safe.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.489
And give J.T. time to narrow down this
list, and figure out who's behind it all.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.689
Actually I'm thinking that we can
figure out who's behind this ourselves.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.401
- By leaving town?
- By controlling the situation, yes.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.244
Think about it.
We've been on the defensive

06:20.400 --> 06:22.323
ever since his first attack,
and it isn't working.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.324
We have gotta turn the tables.
Go on the offence.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.802
Control where and when the next
attack happens. Surprise him for once.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.920
Catherine, we're gonna need
a pretty good reason to leave town.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.481
Otherwise he's gonna think
it's a trap.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.167
Yeah, well, maybe we should elope.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.050
You gotta be kidding me. No.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.761
Not actually elope, obviously,
just make him think that we are.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.649
We're barely one step ahead
of him as it is.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.007
He's gonna believe
that we're just taking off to elope?

06:49.160 --> 06:51.401
Because he knows
how desperate we are.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.846
He first attacked us in a church.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.083
Maybe he thinks we're desperate
to get married before he kills us.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.608
Look, I don't know.
I'm just- I'm tired, and I'm hung--

That's it. We're definitely eloping.

VINCENT:
Well...

07:57.720 --> 07:59.370
- No sign of him.
- Yet.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.205
Don't forget to bring two forms of ID.
For the marriage licence.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.930
Right.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.400
Come on, are you really serious
about going through with this?

08:08.560 --> 08:11.040
- Do you have a better idea?
- Than luring him out of town? No.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.248
- But eloping?
- Okay, it's just a ruse, Vincent.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.244
It's a reason for us to get out of town
so he doesn't think it's a trap.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.323
Unless he thinks
that's exactly what it is.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.369
But if he does,
he's still gonna follow us,

08:20.520 --> 08:22.284
and we can control
the where and the when.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.091
Okay, but what if we actually have to
go through with this

08:25.240 --> 08:26.241
before he attacks us?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.370
Then we do. Don't forget a tie.
We need to make it look legit.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.522
Okay, wait a minute. Are you...?

08:32.039 --> 08:34.280
Are you completely okay with this?

08:34.440 --> 08:38.331
- Relax. I already told you...
- Yeah, okay, I know it's a ruse,

08:38.480 --> 08:40.767
but it also sounds like
you're okay with it if it's not.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.001
Okay, I don't know
if you're aware of this, Vincent,

08:43.159 --> 08:45.766
but there is a superhuman assassin
after us.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.241
- Can we talk about this later?
- No. No, we can't, okay?

08:48.400 --> 08:49.401
I don't want to elope.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.801
I want to get married the right way,
the way we deserve,

08:51.960 --> 08:53.200
in front of friends and family.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.044
But we can't invite
our friends and family.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.931
That's the whole point of us going
to Niagara Falls, to protect them.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.606
I'm not talking about the plan.
lam talking about our wedding.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.922
Or at least the wedding that
I thought we would have.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.243
Vincent, it is just a ruse.

09:06.400 --> 09:12.123
Okay, yes, but would you
or wouldn't you be okay if it wasn't?

09:12.280 --> 09:14.362
I don't know, maybe.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.683
Vincent, all I know is that I love you
and I want to be your wife,

09:17.840 --> 09:20.320
and the sooner the better.
Don't you want that too?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.528
Yes, of course it is, okay? But--

09:22.680 --> 09:25.729
Okay, the only way to do that is for us
to get our lives back first.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.681
What are we gonna tell your sister?
Or J.T. or Tess, for that matter?

09:30.840 --> 09:34.208
We are not going to tell them anything.
We can't. For their own safety.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.249
Especially Tess.
She's already risked too much

09:36.400 --> 09:38.004
trying to get everybody
police protection.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.162
I don't want her to get hurt
helping us.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.367
Okay.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.171
Okay, I think we've got everything.
Are we doing this thing or not?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.847
- I guess.
- Vincent Keller, I love you.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.968
And I don't need a piece of paper
to prove it.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.488
But the bad guy might.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.649
All right. Let us go
and get our "happily ever after" back.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.684
- The chief's still holding.
- All right, tell him I'm in a meeting.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.763
- That's what I told him last time.
- Well...

10:14.720 --> 10:19.169
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hey, sorry. I...

10:19.320 --> 10:21.641
- I need a minute.
- But the chief sounds really upset.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.327
- Captain, I think he wants to--
- I know what he wants. I'll call back.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.810
If you're interested,
he wants to know

10:27.960 --> 10:29.769
why I authorised
the extra police protection.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.160
He wants to know what it's for,

10:31.320 --> 10:34.369
but I can't tell him, of course, because
it's about all this superhuman crap.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.602
Which brings me to,
what the hell are you doing here?

10:36.760 --> 10:37.807
You're mad.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.247
Oh, J.T., see, that's why I love you.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.209
You always pick up
on the tiniest detail.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.725
I know. I'm sorry.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.646
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. I just...
I don't know how to juggle it all, okay?

10:48.800 --> 10:51.724
I am responsible for
real cases, police cases,

10:51.880 --> 10:54.087
- and I keep getting sidetracked by--
- Formaldehyde.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.810
- What?
- I think I just narrowed down

10:55.960 --> 10:57.530
the list of labs for Vincent.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.170
We're trying to backtrack
who infected

10:59.320 --> 11:00.924
all those innocent victims
a few days ago,

11:01.080 --> 11:03.401
to try to find
who's behind the experiments.

if you told me you were coming here.

Cat, it's your sister,
responding to your text message,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.081
which, aside from being rude
because it was a group text,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.605

bolt town without telling anyone first.

No, he's still following us.
We stick to the plan.

Yes. And even if we have to
go through with the ceremony,

16:05.640 --> 16:08.962
it doesn't have to count. Not if we don't
file the marriage certificate afterwards.

- You are such a romantic.

- I'm starting to think we don't have to.
- What?

The more I think about it, the more
I think we should let him catch us.

- That's what he wants anyway, right?
- Yeah. What?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.684
So we make him think
that he succeeded?

16:30.840 --> 16:32.649
- Something like that, yeah.
- And then what?

Okay, let's say he takes us back
to whoever sent him.

We saw what he can do with bullets.

- Yeah, but he hasn't seen

16:41.520 --> 16:42.521

For one reason or another,

- She's fine,

without ever getting a chance
to get married.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.322
Well, it's a good thing
we didn't elope, then, right?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.970
Yeah, it is.

36:25.920 --> 36:31.051
My parents, they didn't romanticize
their wedding the way yours did.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.328
Oh, well, you know,
everybody's different, you know?

36:33.480 --> 36:35.084
Doesn't mean they didn't
love each other.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.720
No, I know. And they did.

36:38.520 --> 36:42.161
It wasn't until it hit me
that we might not get a real wedding

36:42.320 --> 36:45.369
that I realised that I might want one.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.968
- Do you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

36:54.360 --> 36:59.400
Especially after everything we've been
through to get here, against all odds.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.771
I don't want to lose you without
celebrating what we have together.

37:07.600 --> 37:13.607
I want to marry you, Vincent Keller,
and treasure those memories forever.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.044
- I love you.
- I love you too.

37:20.305 --> 37:26.470
