00:06.298 --> 00:07.925
- [cell phone ringing]
- [Wagner sighs]

00:08.592 --> 00:09.802
Oh, shit.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.471
Hello?

00:14.222 --> 00:15.432
- [man on phone] <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.975
What's goin' on?

00:17.851 --> 00:20.979
Uh-oh. Talking back to the tutor,
like, the people...

00:21.063 --> 00:22.480
Or the coaches?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.905
Okay. And this has all happened
since he had surgery

00:29.988 --> 00:31.490
or it was happening before?

00:32.533 --> 00:35.744
All right. I'll see if I can get in touch
with him

00:35.828 --> 00:37.370
and see what I can do.

00:37.955 --> 00:38.956
Bye.

00:41.208 --> 00:48.173
That was UAB on DJ Law.
Apparently, DJ has fallen off big time.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.427
And he had surgery on his knee...

00:53.553 --> 00:55.347
and he's not doing well...

00:56.599 --> 00:57.975
since the surgery.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.393
[laughing]

01:00.477 --> 01:02.229
What's up, Miss Wagner?

01:04.356 --> 01:05.733
What's up? Ah! [chuckles]

01:05.816 --> 01:08.318
- Look at you.
- Don't do that. Don't do that.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.153
[DJ] <i>It sucks not to play this year,</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:12.948
<i>but just did a lot of praying,
just kept hope, kept faith.</i>

01:13.031 --> 01:16.034
I strive to get to the NFL,
I strive to reach my goal,

01:16.118 --> 01:17.620
strive to take care of my family.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.162
[Wagner] <i>They told me they have,</i>

01:19.246 --> 01:23.208
like, somebody at all your classes
and you can't miss anything.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.878
- Taking classes. Every class.
- Tutoring for every class.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.338
Miss class, you rolling 100 yards, so...

01:28.421 --> 01:32.550
[Wagner] <i>I think the kid is full</i>
<i>of a lot of self-doubt.</i>

01:32.635 --> 01:36.930
<i>But a part of me also thinks
that the system is a little bit broken.</i>

01:37.014 --> 01:40.100
- Stanky leg.
- Ah, hit it with me. Ah!

01:40.183 --> 01:42.519
- [Trickett] Look at this!
- [both laughing]

01:42.602 --> 01:44.772
- What's up, bud? You good?
- What's up? Oh, yeah.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.189
Where did... where did that go?

01:46.273 --> 01:48.459
- Hey, I had to get it gone, man. Yeah.
- Huh? You good?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.652
- How's practice?
- Awesome.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.736
- Yeah?
- It's awesome.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.171
- Isn't it? Cool, ain't it?
- Dude.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.572
I figured. I'm like, "He's gonna love it

01:54.657 --> 01:56.574
- when he does it." Yeah.
- Dude... Oh, my God.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.762
[Wyatt] <i>I went to Mississippi State.</i>
<i>Gonna be a regular student.</i>

01:58.786 --> 02:02.289
I got in a little, small cabin with a dog
out in the country.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.813
Going to school at State
and working construction on the side.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.211
<i>And out of nowhere, a coach
from Mississippi State called me and said,</i>

02:08.295 --> 02:10.356
<i>"Would you be interested in walking on
at Mississippi State?</i>

02:10.380 --> 02:11.882
<i>We have a spot for you."</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:13.842
<i>And I literally began shaking.</i>

02:13.926 --> 02:15.928
<i>It was so surreal to me. I...</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:17.971
<i>I've grown up a Mississippi State fan.</i>

02:18.055 --> 02:23.476
And then to actually put on the clothes
and live that lifestyle, it's so surreal.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.020
You can't put it into words

02:25.103 --> 02:26.855
when that's been your dream
your whole life.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.483
[Dan Mullen whistles] Hey, listen up, men.
Hey, listen up.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.446
You control every part of your future.
You control it through the attitude

02:34.529 --> 02:37.532
that you have on the field
and the effort in which you give.

02:37.615 --> 02:40.786
You control what the outcome
of your future's gonna be.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.639
[Mullen] Young guys, old guys,
everybody's at different levels.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.874
Everyone's getting reps today,
opportunity to improve

02:45.958 --> 02:47.542
and go enjoy the game.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.878
- [indistinct chatter]
- [whistle blows]

02:51.379 --> 02:53.381
[player] Have a good game, man.
Have fun, man.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.675
- Attack on three. One, two, three.
- [all] Attack!

02:56.634 --> 02:59.096
[Wyatt] <i>I'm a walk-on quarterback.</i>
<i>I'm redshirted this season.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.820
<i>Redshirts, we don't travel to away games.</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:02.725
<i>We stay at the house
and cook out and watch it</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:04.893
<i>and ring our cowbells
as loud as we can.</i>

03:04.977 --> 03:06.871
<i>During home games,
you'll see us on the sidelines</i>

03:06.895 --> 03:10.190
with towels and workout gear.
We're called the "juice boys."

03:10.273 --> 03:14.194
So, we keep the energy up and holler
as loud as we can throughout the game.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.445
[indistinct chatter]

03:17.781 --> 03:19.074
[players grunting]

03:22.035 --> 03:23.746
[Wyatt] <i>If I never touch the field,</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:25.247
<i>you know, it's gonna be okay.</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:27.457
<i>Kids all over the world would kill to be
in my spot.</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:32.337
<i>The feeling of coming out of a tunnel
with 70,000 people screaming and hollering</i>

03:32.420 --> 03:35.048
<i>is unlike anything I've ever felt before.</i>

03:35.883 --> 03:37.342
[crowd cheering]

03:40.053 --> 03:41.805
[stadium announcer speaking indistinctly]

03:45.642 --> 03:47.745
[John] <i>For me, it was being</i>
<i>in that environment again,</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:48.979
<i>on that big stage.</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:51.207
That's what I live to play for.
I love playing in front of people,

03:51.231 --> 03:53.316
and I was just always chasing
that feeling.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.692
[crowd cheering]

04:13.211 --> 04:14.563
[John] <i>One of my reasons</i>
<i>for going to Auburn</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:16.965
<i>was just the chance and opportunity
to play right away.</i>

04:17.049 --> 04:20.427
<i>So I got there and there was a lot
of talk about me being a starter,</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:23.722
<i>and I felt real good because of the time
and the efforts I put in,</i>

04:24.222 --> 04:26.724
<i>and, you know,
things didn't go my way, so...</i>

04:26.809 --> 04:28.489
<i>Things didn't go my way here, it's like...</i>

04:28.518 --> 04:32.147
<i>It almost felt like a remake
of what happened to me while I was here,</i>

04:32.230 --> 04:34.066
and it's playing out like that again,

04:34.149 --> 04:36.860
so I'm just waiting on that opportunity
like it happened here

04:36.943 --> 04:41.114
'cause I know once the opportunity comes,
I know I'm gonna take advantage of it.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.365
[indistinct chatter]

04:42.449 --> 04:45.452
[John] <i>I wanna win the Heisman.</i>
<i>I wanna win a national championship.</i>

04:45.535 --> 04:49.081
<i>And I wanna go
as a first-round pick in the NFL Draft.</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:54.502
[Wagner laughing]

04:56.546 --> 04:58.173
- [Ollie grunts]
- [Wagner laughing]

04:58.256 --> 05:01.259
[Wagner] What are you doing?
You look like a grown man!

05:01.844 --> 05:04.387
- You look so different.
- I know.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.143
- [Wagner] Look at your little hair!
- You was bound to go after that boy.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.614
[Wagner] <i>He always wanted to go to Auburn.</i>

05:10.685 --> 05:12.312
<i>But I feel like
if he had gone to Auburn,</i>

05:12.395 --> 05:16.817
<i>he might have gotten swallowed
in just the bigness of Auburn.</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:17.901
<i>At that level...</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:21.321
people don't care about you
as much as people

05:21.404 --> 05:23.949
as they do as football players. [chuckles]

05:24.032 --> 05:26.451
When you're playing great,
they love you and you're the best,

05:26.535 --> 05:29.913
but the minute you screw up,
everybody hates you and you suck.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.833
That's not good for Ollie.
That's not a good environment.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.060
- [Wagner] Love you.
- I love you.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.087
I need, like, a big tackle with,
like, a... [grunts]

05:37.170 --> 05:38.314
- All right.
- [people laughing]

05:38.338 --> 05:39.648
- I'mma see what I can do.
- Okay.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.758
- I'mma see what I can... [laughs]
- [Wagner] Okay.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.094
- [Wagner] Bye, love ya.
- [Ollie] All right. Love you.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.265
[Wagner] <i>I feel like at Nicholls,</i>
<i>they truly care about him as a person,</i>

05:48.348 --> 05:51.434
<i>and you could tell.
Like, people there love them.</i>

05:52.019 --> 05:53.603
Ollie needs to be at a place like that.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.780
[crowd cheering]

06:07.534 --> 06:08.734
[Ollie] <i>I don't have a plan B.</i>

[Marcel Andry] <i>NFL comes, great. If not...</i>

06:11.038 --> 06:13.081
[Ollie] <i>If it don't,</i>
<i>it wasn't meant to be.</i>

06:13.665 --> 06:15.750
The Lord will send me a sign, you know.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.629
So, I'm just putting everything up to Him.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.175
And whatever happens, it happens.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.066
Turn your camera around.
You're upside down.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.501
- Who that?
- [Ollie on phone] <i>You sideways.</i>

[Ollie] <i>If I had to go back,</i>
<i>I wouldn't go.</i>

06:55.207 --> 06:56.416
I just wouldn't.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.086
[chuckles]

06:59.169 --> 07:01.046
I wouldn't. Telling the truth.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.048
- I'm in a better place now.
- Yeah.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.842
- Mentally, physically, spiritually.
- Tell it like it is.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.012
We'll sum it up for you.
Best of luck to you, Buddy Stephens.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.097
Coach Buddy Stephens.

You wouldn't think
they would take the nigga seriously.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.391
I never thought he would win.
I thought he was funny.

- What?

08:21.459 --> 08:22.728
[player 2] They wanted him to win

08:40.853 --> 08:43.106
[Isaiah] Y'all see that Trump sign
hanging outside?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.359

We gonna make America white again."

And had the flag by it?

08:57.329 --> 08:59.831
And had the American flag by it. [laughs]

11:10.337 --> 11:14.006
[Tooney] <i>They're not gonna have a choice</i>
<i>but to put us in the national championship</i>

11:14.090 --> 11:15.633
if we win Saturday.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.302
I mean, they got to do it.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.554
If you look at strength of schedule...

11:20.346 --> 11:25.894
versus the other teams that's undefeated,
you got to put us in.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.937
Hopefully, we'll be at least number two.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.440
And you got to be one or two
to play in the game, so...

11:30.523 --> 11:33.651
If they don't put us
at number two or number one...

11:34.402 --> 11:36.904
we gonna have to drive out
and have a little old talk with 'em.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.615
- Yes, sir.
- [both laugh]

11:39.657 --> 11:41.826
- Yeah.
- [Tooney] We'll get out the shotgun.

11:41.909 --> 11:42.910
Yes, sir.

11:42.994 --> 11:43.994
[Chauncey] <i>I'm a dog.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:46.623
Now, watch Chauncey. Look at Chauncey...

11:46.706 --> 11:48.375
[Chauncey] I'm too clutch.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.543
[player 1] You got two inches
off the ground.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.587
- [Chauncey laughs] Sorry.
- [indistinct chatter]

11:52.670 --> 11:55.671
[Chauncey] I had just made that tackle
on point, bro. I was dumb tired, bro.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.926
Hey, so did number one
or number two lose yet?

11:59.010 --> 12:01.763
- [player 1] I don't even know.
- So, no natty?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.973
[player 1] We don't know yet.
They got one more game.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.433
[player 2] They hate us.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.185
All because of Jones. And they were trash.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.229
[player 2] But we beat
the number one team.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.357
[Wood] <i>I've had people ask</i>
<i>about the national title,</i>

12:12.440 --> 12:14.401
I've had people ask me about bowls.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.610
Win, you go to a bowl.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.779
Win the game by the right amount
or whatever,

12:17.862 --> 12:20.623
maybe you get the vote to go
to the big game. We'll see how that goes.

12:20.657 --> 12:24.076
Last year, Northwest had a loss
and played for the national title.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.913
Right now, we win this game,
we go to it 10-1.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.166
But all of that's a wash
if I don't handle my business

12:30.249 --> 12:31.770
and do what I'm supposed to this week.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.647
[Wood] Not worried about what happened
last week, the week before,

12:34.671 --> 12:36.548
or three weeks ago when we played 'em.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.175
Interested in, right now,
what's in front of us.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.097
- [Pellegrin] That's Stephens.
- [Milner] The team motto there.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.933
[Pellegrin] There's Stephens 3:16.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.812
[Milner] <i>We are currently</i>
<i>ranked number three.</i>

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
<i>The two teams ahead of us
are both undefeated.</i>

12:52.939 --> 12:56.233
<i>Garden City, who's ranked number one,
while Arizona Western's ranked two.</i>

12:56.318 --> 12:59.571
The only way that we jump into those two,
one or two spots

12:59.654 --> 13:01.698
is if one of those two teams lose.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.410
If we had beaten Jones
and were undefeated right now,

13:05.493 --> 13:07.454
I think we would be ranked number one.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.222
[knocking at door]

13:28.265 --> 13:30.059
Thought we had a meeting at two o'clock.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.061
Yeah, we do.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.356
It's 2:07.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.817
Hurry up, man.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.070
What did we talk about earlier today?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.322
- [Kam] Hmm?
- What... I mean...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.409
Man, at some point, you gonna get it.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.996
I mean, you got to, man.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.874
At some point,
you're gonna have to get it.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.420
I mean, 'cause babysitting you every day,
coming to get you,

13:57.504 --> 13:59.631
taking you places, like, it's getting old.

14:00.965 --> 14:05.261
And you should be tired of me
having to do that, like, every single day.

14:13.394 --> 14:17.190
[Wagner] <i>You do go to class better.</i>
<i>Not where I want you to be, but better.</i>

14:17.690 --> 14:21.068
[player] They had him rolling
after practice a couple times.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.236
Nigga, you think...

14:22.319 --> 14:25.281
You think I'm gonna listen
to anything Dav say anymore?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.534
[Kam] Telling me corporal punishment...

14:27.617 --> 14:30.327
That nigga better...
I mean, that dude better get out my face.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.874
[Kam] This nigga came to my room
this morning talking about, "Kam, get up."

14:34.957 --> 14:37.752
- I look at him like this.
- [Wagner] He's trying to help you...

14:37.835 --> 14:39.980
- I said, "When do you talk to me?"
- [Wagner] ...go to class and succeed.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.425
And then went back to sleep.
They sent Coach CJ in there to wake me up.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.178
'Cause I fuck with Coach CJ.
Coach CJ, that's my homeboy.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.261
[Wagner sighs] Okay.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.723
What does CJ do that you like?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.410
[player] He don't get on him
like Coach Williams.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.227
No, I can't...
I can't dislike both of my coaches.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.104
- [players laugh]
- [sighs]

14:58.189 --> 15:00.316
- [Kam chuckles]
- I suck. I suck.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.402
I'm the worst academic counselor...

15:02.485 --> 15:03.837
- [Kam] You the best. Don't say that.
- In the country.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.280
[Wagner] My job is to make Kam better.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.159
I suck at it 'cause I'm not succeeding
in making Kam better.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.329
Kam going be straight regardless.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.749
[Williams] Jackson,
you have got to squeeze.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.876
How come I feel like
we watched this play before?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.252
You did it again, okay?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.422
When folks come in here
and watch film on you,

15:22.505 --> 15:24.705
and they see that in the game,
that's what you're doing.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.008
[players laughing]

15:27.510 --> 15:31.138
Son, you have no excuse...
Reason to laugh or talk about nobody.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.534
- [Williams] Quit it.
- It was funny.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.309
- [Williams] You know what's funny?
- What?

15:35.393 --> 15:38.771
[Williams] When you gonna be back
wherever you from with no scholarship.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.440
Shit, I got offers.

15:40.523 --> 15:44.736
[Williams laughs mockingly]
Okay. All right.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.196
[Williams] An offer don't mean nothing,
son.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.698
That's where it starts.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.992
[Williams] Yeah,
that's where it ends, too.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.035
With a commitment.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.080
[interviewer] <i>Do you worry that Kam,</i>

15:56.163 --> 15:59.542
just given what you witnessed
and how he struggled,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.377
is that gonna hurt his recruiting?

16:07.925 --> 16:08.968
Maybe.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.018
[Wagner] <i>I haven't had anyone</i>
<i>ask about him.</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:19.521
<i>I know that he and Coach Williams
don't really jive either,</i>

16:19.604 --> 16:21.648
<i>and that could be part of it.
That, you know,</i>

16:21.731 --> 16:23.775
<i>Coach Williams may not be selling him.</i>

16:23.858 --> 16:26.110
I mean, coaches may come in and say,
"Okay, who you got?"

16:26.193 --> 16:27.236
They may not watch a game.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.280
"Okay, who you got
that I should be looking at?"

16:29.363 --> 16:32.366
Well, if you don't like someone,
or you're not...

16:32.950 --> 16:34.494
Then you're not gonna push their name.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.038
You're gonna push
the kids that you like first.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.294
[Buddy] People don't understand
what a great kid he is.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.589
I'm gonna tell you something,
we've had kids here

16:46.672 --> 16:49.300
that have gone on to other places
and don't have half...

16:49.801 --> 16:52.261
- the moral compass that he's got.
- [Glenn Thomas] Really?

16:52.344 --> 16:56.516
[Buddy] He made a bad mistake
because he was in a place...

16:56.599 --> 16:58.685
And I'mma tell you something,
that's a kid

16:58.768 --> 17:01.353
that'll never let that happen again.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.315
- [Glenn] Right.
- [Buddy] For him, if he has a chance to go

17:04.398 --> 17:08.402
and play at the level that y'all have got,
he'll have a chance to go the NFL.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.447
And I'm just gonna be honest with you,
when y'all pull the trigger,

17:11.531 --> 17:12.925
there's gonna be somebody else
pull the trigger.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.659
- No question.
- And there's gonna be...

17:14.742 --> 17:17.954
You know, and I mean,
I've seen it enough to know it's gonna be.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.247
And so, I'm tickled.
I'm tickled you guys...

17:20.331 --> 17:22.374
If you guys come back and offer him.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.376
- Have y'all done that?
- Not that I know of,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.212
to be quite honest, this is kind of our...

17:26.295 --> 17:29.090
My first introduction to him,
to be quite frank.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.382
[indistinct chatter]

17:31.968 --> 17:34.554
[Wagner] <i>He's played</i>
<i>so phenomenally this fall,</i>

17:34.637 --> 17:39.183
<i>and it would be a shame
for a kid to do everything</i>

17:39.266 --> 17:42.144
that he needed to do
to rehabilitate himself,

17:42.228 --> 17:46.190
to handle his academics,
to handle his play on the field,

17:46.273 --> 17:48.067
and then not get an offer

17:48.150 --> 17:50.277
based on something
that happened two years ago,

17:50.361 --> 17:52.655
<i>and that was a one-time,
isolated incident.</i>

17:52.739 --> 17:54.574
<i>But if a player plays well enough,</i>

17:54.657 --> 17:58.870
<i>I've never seen anybody not get an offer
based on a prior incident.</i>

17:58.953 --> 18:02.164
Now, we've also never had anyone with a...

18:05.793 --> 18:07.211
issue with a female.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.673
So, you know, I don't know.
Maybe that's different, I don't know.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.478
So, how's year two been for you?

18:24.561 --> 18:27.231
'Cause I know, last year,
you kinda got your shot to,

18:27.314 --> 18:29.675
- you know, step in for DJ, but...
- [Isaiah] Yeah, I had...

18:29.734 --> 18:32.194
I had a little injury
that slowed me a little.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.922
You didn't have surgery,
you played through it?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.031
Mmm-mmm, I played.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.795
Are you gonna have to, or how you feeling?

18:36.824 --> 18:39.994
- I mean, I can play on it now.
- Yeah.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.247
But they say I have to have the surgery,
but it don't matter to me.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.042
- Just tape it up and you're good.
- Yeah, tape it up and I'mma go.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.168
That's good, man.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.504
[De'Andre] Hey, y'all, on a serious note,

18:50.587 --> 18:55.927
we're 46 hours out, so please,
no play fighting, none of that.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.472
You know what I'm saying, it's too close,
all right? It's too close.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.598
'Cause, yo, I almost fell
in the shower last night.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.392
- [all laugh]
- I swear to God.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.603
[player] Stop taking bubble baths
and putting all that shit in your water.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.690
Lions on three, champs on six.
One, two, three.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.917
- [all] Lions.
- Four, five, six.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.150
- [all] Champs.
- I see him.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.486
[Buddy] Run... Good. Nice job! Attababy!

19:14.570 --> 19:15.905

19:15.988 --> 19:17.699
- [player grunts]
- [Trickett] Hit it!

19:20.159 --> 19:22.328
- Man, people need filming.
- Yeah.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.664
Know what I mean?
It's games for guys getting...

19:24.747 --> 19:26.809
- Hopefully get good looks, man.
- Yeah. That is true.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.751
[De'Andre] That's what hurt
the guys last year.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.921
- [Brian] Right. Not... Games... No film.
- [De'Andre] Not having enough film.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.548
You know what I'm saying?
Teams want winners, man.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.468
- Hell yeah.
- If you can win, keep on winning. Why not?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.553
Everybody loves a winner.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.430
"You ain't gonna live to see your kids."

20:23.514 --> 20:25.850
[Johnson] We shouldn't have
to stop practice for this.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.370
- This is bullshit! No, I don't care!
- He wanna run his mouth.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.437
- And he wanna still run his mouth.

No, you taking away from these guys

20:52.168 --> 20:55.171
It ain't about you.
Now you making it about ten other people.

They can't get reps
because you out here acting stupid.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.051
- That ain't me.
- That's what it's about.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.636
- Yeah, it is you. It is you!
- Nuh-uh.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.264
[Williams] I want you guys
to understand something, okay?

21:05.347 --> 21:09.518
Ever since we won last week, it's been
a whole lot of negativity going on.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.980
Whole lot of dumb stuff going on,
including today, what just happened.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.167
Some of you are going to have
the opportunity to go D-I,

21:15.191 --> 21:18.319
and play ball next year,
some of you ain't, okay?

21:19.070 --> 21:21.572
That's the goddarnest truth, okay?

21:21.655 --> 21:23.950
But while you here right now, okay,

21:24.033 --> 21:26.911
your main focus needs to be winning
this ball game on Saturday.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.496
[Williams] Let's focus on the team,
and the team only.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.290
If somebody ask you about what happened,

21:31.373 --> 21:34.585
we handled it as a defensive line.
Keep this shit to ourselves.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.462
- Can y'all do that?
- [players] Yes, sir.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.826
[Williams] Wait till they call you...
Y'all break it down.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.568
[player] Break it down. Family on me,
family on three. One, two, three.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.634
[all] Family.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.932
- [Trickett] What up?
- What's the matter?

21:48.599 --> 21:50.392
See you later, man. Nah, never mind.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.937
[Buddy] Come here. What's wrong?
You all right?

21:53.020 --> 21:54.740
- Yeah. I'm straight, Coach.
- You feel bad?

21:54.771 --> 21:56.899
Nah, just a little something on the field.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.944
- What happened on the field?
- Nothing. I mean, we just got into a...

22:00.027 --> 22:01.612
I guess me and Jay just got into a...

22:01.695 --> 22:02.822
- You and Jay?
- Yeah.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.025
I ain't worried about you and Jay.
Y'all can fix that.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.534
- I ain't trippin'.
- Just, you know, love each other.

22:07.618 --> 22:10.037
- Everybody loves everybody. All right?
- Mmm.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.623
- Come on, let's go. Go, go, go.
- All right, Coach.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.541
- Go settle it. You understand?
- Uh-huh.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.920
Hey, be the bigger person, go settle it,
love each other.

22:18.004 --> 22:21.215
Love your teammate. What, hey...
Do I need to talk to Jay?

22:21.298 --> 22:22.943
- [Kam] No, it's cool, Coach.
- You got it?

22:22.967 --> 22:24.760
All right, I'll see you later, man.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.265
Bye! That is a beautiful bandana
you have on, by the way.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.348
[player] Thank you.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.936
Hey, come help me pick up
the tape off the floor. Make sure that...

22:34.020 --> 22:35.354
[Buddy] <i>True change...</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:38.983
True change in someone
has gotta come from the inside.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.902
It can't come from the outside.

22:40.985 --> 22:44.989
You can shine a vehicle up,
but if it runs like a hunk of junk,

22:45.072 --> 22:46.823
it's a hunk of junk. You know?

22:47.699 --> 22:52.788
We've had guys lose their temper.
I've been more understanding of that.

22:52.871 --> 22:57.543
I've been more empathetic with that,
and I'm not there yet.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.129
You know, I struggle every single day.

23:00.212 --> 23:04.716
I'm not where I wanna be,
but I'm different than I was a year ago.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.727
[players laughing]

23:15.811 --> 23:17.438
[player] It was a Thursday.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.816
You know, I was feeling good
'cause we had a game the next day.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.156
- [Buddy] <i>Ready to go up there?</i>
- [Wood] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:28.324
- [Buddy] <i>Who did Cade have to get?</i>
- [Wood] <i>Isaiah.</i>

23:28.407 --> 23:29.950
- [Buddy] <i>Huh?</i>
- [Wood] <i>Isaiah.</i>

23:30.451 --> 23:31.868
[Buddy] <i>What an idiot.</i>

23:34.455 --> 23:37.583
<i>Why, the night before we play a ball game,
do I have to come get y'all?</i>

23:38.209 --> 23:39.209
[Wood] <i>Sleeping.</i>

23:39.251 --> 23:41.920
[Buddy] <i>Why? Why? Shh.</i>

23:42.004 --> 23:44.381
<i>Hey! Hey, Isaiah, just get out.</i>

23:45.257 --> 23:48.219
<i>Your ass has got people depending on you.</i>

23:48.302 --> 23:49.553
<i>Keep your ass walking.</i>

23:50.637 --> 23:51.555
<i>Hey, Isaiah?</i>

23:51.638 --> 23:55.267
<i>If you think I'm gonna set out
and sell my ass out for you,</i>

23:55.351 --> 23:57.853
<i>for what you do... I ain't gonna do it.</i>

23:57.936 --> 24:00.606
<i>You come in late,
you do your own damn thing.</i>

24:00.689 --> 24:01.958
[Isaiah] <i>I ain't have my phone on.</i>

24:01.982 --> 24:05.194
[Buddy] <i>"I ain't have my phone on."</i>
<i>You got everybody else up there.</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:06.737
[Isaiah] <i>All right. Yes, sir.</i>

24:06.820 --> 24:09.240
[Buddy] <i>That's the difference.</i>
<i>Your ass don't give a shit.</i>

24:09.323 --> 24:10.800
<i>You don't give a shit
about the people up there,</i>

24:10.824 --> 24:13.285
<i>but you expect people
to give a shit about you.</i>

24:13.785 --> 24:14.996
<i>That's the damn difference!</i>

24:15.079 --> 24:17.665
<i>That's why your ass
is gonna end up doing what you doing.</i>

24:18.624 --> 24:20.209
<i>And you don't damn see it!</i>

24:21.460 --> 24:22.878
<i>Biggest game we got all year,</i>

24:22.961 --> 24:26.548
<i>and your ass is so damn selfish,
you won't get out of the damn bed.</i>

24:27.133 --> 24:29.176
<i>And you wanna make a fucking excuse.</i>

24:29.260 --> 24:30.177
[Isaiah] <i>I didn't.</i>

24:30.261 --> 24:32.513
[Buddy] <i>Yes, you make excuse...</i>
<i>"I didn't have my phone."</i>

24:32.596 --> 24:34.223
<i>- Bullshit!</i>
- [door slams]

24:34.848 --> 24:36.729
[Timothy Alexander]
I got ranked my junior year,

24:36.767 --> 24:38.352
sent my team to the playoffs,

24:38.435 --> 24:41.230
and then the next day,
I'm in a very bad car accident,

24:41.313 --> 24:43.565
leaving me paralyzed from the neck down.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.568
Some of you guys that return
know exactly how it feel

24:46.652 --> 24:48.570
to have something
that you love taken away.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.364
Everybody know how that feel.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.509
[Alexander] But you gotta continue
believing in yourself.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.909
You gonna have to fight tomorrow.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.620
I challenge y'all, man.
One of my favorite verses,

24:56.703 --> 24:58.747
and I challenge you to read it
before you play,

24:58.830 --> 25:00.916
<i>Jeremiah 29:11.</i>

25:00.999 --> 25:03.210
"For I know the plans I have for you.

25:03.293 --> 25:06.338
Plans to prosper me,
to give me a future and a hope."

25:06.839 --> 25:09.675
Think about that,
'cause that's one of my favorite verses.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.843
Um, you know...

25:12.678 --> 25:17.307
Over the last week,
there's also a verse...

25:18.225 --> 25:20.227
"Be still and know that I'm God."

25:21.228 --> 25:25.857
And I just dealt with a situation...

25:27.609 --> 25:30.154
dealing with one of your teammates...

25:30.779 --> 25:33.949
that live less than 100 yards
from this room.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.369
Can't show up on time for a meeting.

25:39.455 --> 25:45.544
I leave my daughter's high school game,
the last time that she's gonna...

25:45.627 --> 25:48.380
she's gonna perform at a half-time show,

25:48.964 --> 25:51.925
and I missed that
to be here at nine o'clock.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.261
To be here for this meeting.

25:55.596 --> 25:59.141
And when you have people
that won't show up on time,

25:59.683 --> 26:03.354
and they live less than 100 yards away,
I got a problem with that.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.565
But I'm trying to be still...

26:07.274 --> 26:09.818
and I'm trying to know
how I'm going to react to that.

26:10.194 --> 26:13.447
But I can tell you one thing.
Tomorrow, I'll be on time.

26:14.448 --> 26:15.907
I'll be on time tomorrow,

26:15.991 --> 26:18.243
and I want to know
who's gonna be on time with me.

26:18.744 --> 26:22.289
Okay? There's a lot going on tomorrow.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.542
I'm not gonna let anything
disturb my focus.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.337
I'm not gonna let anything
take the focus away.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.174
I just... I need to know,
you gonna be on time?

26:32.258 --> 26:33.259
[players] Yes, sir.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.861
- Gonna be on time?
- [players] Yes, sir!

26:34.885 --> 26:36.470
That's all I need to know.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.573
If you gonna be on time
for a good old-fashioned butt whoopin',

26:38.597 --> 26:40.238
either one of two things is gonna happen.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.434
You either gonna give it
or you're gonna get it.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.439
[Isaiah] <i>He's a good coach.</i>
<i>He's a good coach.</i>

26:47.523 --> 26:49.733
<i>He know what he's talking about.
He know what he doing.</i>

26:50.359 --> 26:53.445
I can just say what he...
Where he lacks at is

26:53.529 --> 26:55.822
he lacks of knowing his players.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.824
He lacks of knowing
where his players come from,

26:57.908 --> 27:01.537
how they react to stuff
and how they don't react to stuff.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.871
And then he just...

27:05.791 --> 27:06.917
[grunts softly]

27:07.000 --> 27:09.211
[clicks tongue] He misreads people.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.720
[Camion] <i>Being on our own</i>
<i>for that little time when we were alone,</i>

27:18.804 --> 27:21.848
we didn't have anybody to tell us,
like, what to do.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.810
Like, at a young age
where we needed a lot of guidance.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.063
So, I feel like that's
where we take on authority,

27:28.146 --> 27:30.274
like, different than anyone else.

27:30.357 --> 27:34.403
Like, we always think, "All right.
You're trying to screw me over."

27:38.407 --> 27:39.575
<i>Buddy...</i> [chuckles]

27:40.242 --> 27:43.454
I knew him and Isaiah would,
you know, butt heads,

27:43.537 --> 27:46.457
<i>'cause Isaiah is gonna be Isaiah,
and he's gonna question things</i>

27:46.540 --> 27:48.375
<i>and Buddy don't like to be questioned.</i>

27:48.459 --> 27:51.878
<i>When you're getting recruited, the coaches
get everything from your coaches</i>

27:51.962 --> 27:54.340
<i>and then if all you're doing
is cussing 'em out</i>

27:54.423 --> 27:56.049
<i>and, you know, being a headache,</i>

27:56.132 --> 27:59.386
<i>that's what they're gonna say
how you are as a person.</i>

27:59.470 --> 28:02.681
And right now you're giving a,
"Well, I'm a shitty person."

28:02.764 --> 28:07.144
I mean, sometimes
you just gotta keep your mouth shut.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.695
[Wagner] Every year, it just seems to get
worse and worse with Buddy.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.698
I don't know what the deal is,
and I just feel like it's not fixable.

28:19.781 --> 28:23.202
And as long as we're working
against each other, like, I feel like I...

28:23.702 --> 28:26.162
I can't get what needs to get done, done.

28:26.247 --> 28:29.291
I mean, I need to go somewhere
where I'm working with the staff,

28:29.375 --> 28:30.417
not against them.

28:30.501 --> 28:31.561
[Chauncey chuckles] I hardly hit you.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.921
[Wagner] I don't know, I mean,
there's some coaches that I think would...

28:35.005 --> 28:37.591
That I've talked to
that I think would do it.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.761
It's just they hadn't gotten a job yet.
[chuckles]

28:41.345 --> 28:42.785
[Rodney] Hey, nah, be cool, be cool.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.515
[players laughing]

28:45.474 --> 28:47.893
[Wagner] Okay, all right. See ya, bye.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.271
[Chauncey] Where's the job?

28:50.354 --> 28:52.275
[Rodney] Ain't no way
you just accepted that job.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.566
It's just coaches
that are in the running for jobs

28:54.650 --> 28:56.860
are calling to see if I'm ready to leave.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.071
- [player 1] Are you ready to leave?
- Yes.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.241
[Dakota whispering] Go. Take the job.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.576
I will take whatever job is offered to me.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.329
I say you go on Twitter. [chuckles]

29:07.413 --> 29:09.831
[Wagner] I could put a tweet.
"I'm opening my recruitment."

29:09.915 --> 29:12.459
- [chuckling]
- Yeah! I'll retweet it.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.421
- [Wagner] Oh, that's funny.
- You'll get picked up. Fast.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.007
- [Wagner] I just gotta...
- You're a baller.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.468
[Wagner] It's hard to do
when your livelihood's on the line.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.600
[Buddy] <i>This is a special group.</i>

29:28.684 --> 29:31.144
I've told you, I think it's
the best football team in America.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.272
Okay? You're a very special group.

29:33.355 --> 29:37.150
Get yourself ready mentally.
Hey, it's gonna be a mentality.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.902
It ain't gonna be just showing up, play.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.322
It's gonna be the mentality
you walk into the game with.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.449
And it's, "I'm fixing to punch you
in the mouth."

29:43.532 --> 29:44.950
<i>That's it, bottom line.</i>

29:49.996 --> 29:52.291
[Isaiah] <i>Your life depends on you</i>
<i>out there on the field.</i>

29:52.374 --> 29:53.917
<i>And when you ain't on that field...</i>

29:55.001 --> 29:58.213
<i>how you know your life going in the way
you want it to go when you ain't playing?</i>

29:58.297 --> 30:00.841
How you know your dreams are gonna
come out to be your dreams,

30:00.924 --> 30:02.175
when you not playing?

30:06.305 --> 30:07.764
[Wagner] <i>Division I programs,</i>

30:07.848 --> 30:11.352
<i>they may sign one
or two JUCO players a year.</i>

30:11.435 --> 30:16.982
<i>Well, they have to sort through 769
junior colleges to find that one player.</i>

30:17.065 --> 30:19.275
<i>But if you're winning
a national championship,</i>

30:19.359 --> 30:22.321
<i>there's more of an opportunity
for you to get looked at.</i>

30:29.035 --> 30:30.396
[Buddy] <i>You have to make a choice.</i>

30:30.454 --> 30:32.956
<i>The coach you think you need to be
or the person I want to be.</i>

30:33.039 --> 30:36.084
<i>My goal every day
is to do whatever we gotta do</i>

30:36.167 --> 30:38.879
<i>to win a national championship.
That's my goal every day.</i>

30:38.962 --> 30:43.384
The mission will always be
to beat people asleep.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.055
[Buddy] <i>Grab a knee.</i>

31:30.138 --> 31:32.849
<i>Some of you have never won a championship,
some of you have.</i>

31:32.933 --> 31:36.645
This is a blast, this is when it's fun.
This is what you came here for.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.398
And it's time for Lions to do
what Lions do.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.942
You know, I...
Earlier in the week, I, uh...

31:42.025 --> 31:45.028
We were listening outside,
and we were listening to a song...

31:45.111 --> 31:47.739
I had a song playing by T.I. and Rihanna,

31:47.823 --> 31:49.825
talking about just how to...
Just live your life.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.326
Guys, this is the greatest...

31:51.410 --> 31:53.179
This is one of the greatest times
of your life.

31:53.203 --> 31:57.332
Today, go out and live your life.

<i>East Mississippi will have
De'Andre Johnson on the field,</i>

We got two freaking guys on his ass!
Horse crap.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.288
Listen, I didn't want to have to worry
about a damn shutout anyway.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.998
So now we don't have to worry about it.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.084
We can keep playing.
We can do what we're gonna do.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.878
[Winfield] <i>We have a tied game</i>

34:46.001 --> 34:48.086

36:18.844 --> 36:20.004
[Buddy] Did you not see that?

36:20.053 --> 36:21.722
[referee] No. I thought he hit and slid.

[Buddy] We can't sit there and stop!
Get a run up and hit somebody!

36:41.867 --> 36:43.952
[Buddy]
Quit standing there watching stuff happen.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.930
[Ed Holly] I hear you, I understand.
They got a...

36:45.954 --> 36:47.431
Every time we stop, there's a penalty.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.374
[Buddy] Get 'em running up
to the dadgum ball.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.126
Stop standing around
watching crap happen!

36:51.209 --> 36:53.669
We're missing tackles
and they're knocking us off the ball.

36:53.754 --> 36:55.338
I don't really have an answer for that.

36:55.421 --> 36:58.884
[Buddy] Making dadgum excuses
all the dadgum time, you know?

36:58.967 --> 37:02.220
[imitates Ed Holly] "He's there.
He's there to make the tackle."

37:02.303 --> 37:03.614

37:12.063 --> 37:13.774
[Beard] <i>The East Mississippi defense</i>

37:26.577 --> 37:28.246
We've stopped them one time. Okay?

37:28.329 --> 37:30.767
- [Ed Holly] We're going man, then.
- I don't care what you do.

37:30.791 --> 37:34.544
You do whatever you gotta do to stop 'em.
That's your job, not mine.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.214
Baby, I'm telling you,
we should have watched film once again.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.968

Get inside, let's go!

37:56.900 --> 37:58.109
[Buddy] Now here's the deal.

37:58.193 --> 38:02.155
On defense, we gotta get off the field.
You're playing flat.

38:02.238 --> 38:05.158
They're just playing
harder than you right now.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.993
Y'all gotta be a part of a team.

38:07.077 --> 38:12.415
I gotta have everybody in here.
I gotta have every coach, every player.

38:12.498 --> 38:16.127
We all miss plays,
but we just gotta pick each other up.

38:16.211 --> 38:20.006
If you don't pick each other up
and play hard for each other,

38:20.090 --> 38:23.301
you will come back in here
with sad, sad faces.

38:23.384 --> 38:26.387
Open up some whoop ass on them
in the second half, understand?

38:26.471 --> 38:27.305
[players] Yes, sir.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.350
[Buddy] Let's go.
Hey, you're the better team!

38:30.433 --> 38:31.977
You are the better team!

38:33.186 --> 38:35.646

38:46.992 --> 38:50.370
Somebody in this group
got to make two plays. Hell, even three.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.664
We have to step up and make a play.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.792
Okay? If you want it,

38:56.877 --> 38:58.062

'Cause in 30 minutes,

Don't have no damn regrets.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.926

[announcer 1] <i>You're trailing by three,</i>

48:26.987 --> 48:28.347
- [dog barks]
- [Buddy] Just twist.

48:28.405 --> 48:32.952
Found out a few years back
that he had cancer.

48:33.744 --> 48:37.289
[Buddy] <i>He's on hospice now.</i>
<i>Not doing very well.</i>

48:37.957 --> 48:40.626
How long have you been up?
What time you gonna go to bed?

48:40.918 --> 48:44.880
Oh, uh, I got up at 10:30 this morning.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.258
[Wafford] I had trouble sleeping.

48:47.633 --> 48:50.010
[Buddy] <i>Don't get to see him</i>
<i>as much as I want to</i>

48:50.094 --> 48:53.222
because of football.

48:53.973 --> 48:58.603
[Buddy] <i>My brother is really his caregiver</i>
<i>along with his hospice nurse.</i>

48:59.186 --> 49:03.983
My dad's a very quiet guy.
Not a... not a heavy talker.

49:05.067 --> 49:08.195
[Wafford chuckles]
<i>That kid always wanted to play sports.</i>

49:08.278 --> 49:12.074
<i>Started out in baseball,
then he got to basketball,</i>

49:12.157 --> 49:13.701
<i>then he got into football,</i>

49:13.784 --> 49:18.288
and then he asked his mother one day
if he could play ice hockey.

49:18.372 --> 49:22.334
[chuckles] His mother told him, "Son,
man, you too big to play ice hockey."

49:22.418 --> 49:25.546
The only reason he was wanting to play
'cause he got to hit people.

49:25.630 --> 49:26.672
Yeah. [chuckles]

49:26.755 --> 49:28.966
[Wafford] <i>He's hard-headed</i>
<i>as a billy goat.</i>

49:29.467 --> 49:32.511
<i>You know, when he was growing up,
he had a mind of his own.</i>

49:33.012 --> 49:34.013
[chuckles]

49:35.264 --> 49:38.017
Well, that was him.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.728
[Wafford] <i>Always wanted to play sports.</i>

49:42.396 --> 49:45.733
[Buddy] <i>Part of this, for me,</i>
<i>is having something to remember Dad by.</i>

49:46.358 --> 49:49.319
'Cause our conversations
are not extensive.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.946
"How you doing?" "Good."

49:52.406 --> 49:53.699
[Wafford] <i>I wanna ask you,</i>

49:53.783 --> 49:56.368
how did that coach
that got y'all in trouble,

49:56.451 --> 49:57.662
when you played him...

49:57.745 --> 50:00.372
[Buddy] It was fine. Everything was...
Everything was fine.

50:00.455 --> 50:02.166
I get so tired of hearing about that.

50:02.833 --> 50:03.834
Everybody whines

50:03.918 --> 50:07.630
and people watch the documentary
and they whine and they cry...

50:07.713 --> 50:09.506
[imitates crying] "Bad language."

50:09.590 --> 50:11.091
[imitates whining]

50:11.175 --> 50:16.138
I get so tired of hearing all that whining
and crying about everything, you know?

50:17.389 --> 50:18.390
[Wafford] Yeah.

50:20.935 --> 50:23.563
[announcer speaking indistinctly on TV]

50:36.200 --> 50:38.160
[Wafford chuckles]
<i>Buddy takes after his mother</i>

50:38.243 --> 50:40.120
<i>'cause he's high-spirited.</i>

50:40.204 --> 50:44.834
I think by him using
his temper on the sideline,

50:44.917 --> 50:47.795
<i>- it's to try to make the kids better.</i>
- [inaudible]

50:47.878 --> 50:50.756
Chris was more conservative.

50:51.548 --> 50:53.909
- [Buddy] I love you.
- [Chris] I don't wanna lose him, Bud.

50:53.968 --> 50:54.969
[Buddy] I know.

50:55.595 --> 50:57.763
[Chris] He's not doing good, though.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.056
[Buddy] I know.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.350
I know. I know.

51:02.059 --> 51:06.063
Thank you for taking care of him.
Thank you. I love you.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.273
I love you so much.

51:11.526 --> 51:15.489
[Wafford] <i>To have these two boys,</i>
<i>see them grow up,</i>

51:15.572 --> 51:18.618
<i>I know that their mother
would appreciate it</i>

51:19.326 --> 51:21.328
for the way they have turned out to be.

51:29.879 --> 51:32.965
[Wagner] <i>Yeah, um...</i>
<i>When is y'all's season over?</i>

51:34.258 --> 51:38.220
[Wagner] No, I...
This'll be it for me, but, yeah,

51:38.303 --> 51:40.640
it's just a matter of, you know,
the best opportunity

51:40.723 --> 51:43.976
and the best place and the right fit
and all that, yeah.

51:44.059 --> 51:45.895
So, but, yeah, I'm definitely interested.

51:47.021 --> 51:51.066
[Wagner] Yeah, definitely. No doubt.
Okay. All right. Bye.

51:52.777 --> 51:53.944
[player] Who that is?

51:54.987 --> 51:56.864
- [player] Yeah, you know.
- [chuckles]

51:57.447 --> 51:58.490
People.

51:58.573 --> 52:00.993
[player] He wants you to come there
and help his students.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.995
[Jay] That's crazy. So you leaving?

52:03.078 --> 52:05.598
[Wagner] What do you think?
Do you think I should leave or stay?

52:05.622 --> 52:06.916
What is your opinion?

52:06.999 --> 52:10.419
What people really don't know,
she the brain behind all this.

52:10.502 --> 52:13.172
Because if it weren't for her,
it wouldn't be no championship.

52:13.255 --> 52:15.925
'Cause, hell,
half of us wouldn't be eligible to play.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.968
[Jay] You like a mama to us.

52:18.594 --> 52:20.846
You know, some of us ain't never had that.

52:21.596 --> 52:23.933
And it kind of like a little blessing
for us, you know.

52:24.016 --> 52:28.896
'Cause, you know, we actually got somebody
that actually care for us.

52:29.563 --> 52:32.941
Man, I wasn't even close
to no honor roll in high school.

52:33.901 --> 52:36.737
My first semester here,
I was on the dean's list.

52:36.821 --> 52:40.157
[Jay] By me coming down here, I grew up.

52:40.240 --> 52:43.994
You know, Scooba, like,
made me become a man,

52:44.078 --> 52:46.288
and you is a big impact on that.

52:46.956 --> 52:51.794
But my outlook on you leaving Scooba,
if it benefits you,

52:51.877 --> 52:55.589
if that's something that you wanna do,
I mean, do it, you know.

52:56.215 --> 52:57.925
You know, like y'all always telling us.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.845
Follow your dream. Follow your dream.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.055
[typing]

53:03.638 --> 53:05.975
- Comma, encouraging and positive?
- [woman] Yeah.

53:06.058 --> 53:07.226
- I like that?
- Mm-hmm.

53:07.309 --> 53:09.103
- You like it?
- Yeah. Maybe one too many...

53:09.186 --> 53:10.938
Yeah. That's good.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.708
[Huebner] <i>Following</i>
<i>a state championship game,</i>

53:12.732 --> 53:14.942
<i>before the final national rankings,</i>

53:15.025 --> 53:16.861
<i>I decided
that I would kind of put together</i>

53:16.944 --> 53:19.654
some notes and some facts
and some figures, some...

53:19.739 --> 53:23.242
In a document and send it to the voters

53:23.325 --> 53:27.412
<i>to make our case for why East Mississippi
should be ranked number one.</i>

53:27.496 --> 53:28.914
Or at least in the top two

53:28.998 --> 53:31.792
and get a chance to play
for the national championship this year.

53:31.876 --> 53:34.128
- So is that...
- I think we're good.

53:34.211 --> 53:36.671
Just maybe a little bit...
Still a little bit too wordy here.

53:36.756 --> 53:39.466
[Huebner] "Exceptionally" is probably
a word I didn't need.

53:39.549 --> 53:41.010
[Huebner] <i>People are well aware</i>

53:41.093 --> 53:43.178
<i>of East Mississippi
Community College football.</i>

53:43.262 --> 53:45.973
<i>The incidents last year
certainly created national attention,</i>

53:46.056 --> 53:49.101
<i>and I'd like to think folks are being
as objective as they can.</i>

53:49.184 --> 53:50.853
It's just hard for me to know.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.562
[Buddy] <i>You don't know.</i>

53:52.646 --> 53:55.649
[Buddy] I mean, you don't ever know
how it's all gonna work out.

53:55.732 --> 53:59.486
Just 'cause of voters. You don't know
who's gonna give you first-place votes.

53:59.569 --> 54:01.947
You don't know who's gonna give you
last-place votes.

54:02.031 --> 54:03.073
I mean, you don't know.

54:03.157 --> 54:09.038
You don't know who, uh...
How people view your team.

54:09.663 --> 54:11.540
You know,
just from what I've heard there's...

54:11.623 --> 54:14.626
there's been some...
There's been some, uh...

54:17.796 --> 54:19.465
There's been some stuff stirring.

54:19.840 --> 54:20.841
[cell phone rings]

54:20.925 --> 54:23.260
[Trickett] But once you get
past that first, you're gone.

54:23.343 --> 54:24.344
[Wood] Yeah. Hey, Coach.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.474
[Wood] Wow. How about that.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.601
Wow.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.729
What? Ah.
Don't even worry about that today.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.774
We'll figure out...
We'll worry about that later.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.860
Yeah. That's crazy.

54:40.777 --> 54:41.778
That's crazy.

54:44.198 --> 54:45.365
It's crazy.

54:46.325 --> 54:52.039
This year's El Toro Bowl will once again
be a national championship El Toro Bowl

54:52.122 --> 54:55.417
- featuring our Arizona Western Matadors...
- [audience applauds]

54:55.500 --> 54:57.752
against Garden City of Kansas.

54:57.836 --> 55:01.423
Our one and two teams will be fighting
for the national championship

55:01.506 --> 55:04.093
here in Yuma once again,
so a round of applause.

55:04.176 --> 55:05.719
[audience applauds]

55:21.944 --> 55:23.570
[Chauncey] <i>What else can you do?</i>

55:23.653 --> 55:25.030
<i>You know? That's how I feel.</i>

55:25.114 --> 55:26.115
<i>Like, what else...</i>

55:26.198 --> 55:27.867
<i>What else needs to be done? You know?</i>

55:27.950 --> 55:29.994
<i>You do so much
to try to get what you deserve,</i>

55:30.077 --> 55:31.745
<i>and yet little has come.</i>

55:37.042 --> 55:38.418
[Wagner] <i>It's a shame.</i>

55:38.502 --> 55:40.230
<i>If you're not number one
or two in the nation,</i>

55:40.254 --> 55:42.923
then you're playing in some bowl game...

55:43.007 --> 55:44.633
[chuckles]

55:44.716 --> 55:46.010
that didn't matter.

55:51.681 --> 55:54.351
[Tooney] <i>Hell, we don't care who you like</i>
<i>or who you dislike.</i>

55:54.434 --> 55:56.311
<i>Vote for who's the best.</i>

55:56.395 --> 56:00.190
The fight cost us
two national championships,

56:00.274 --> 56:01.149
and that's wrong.

56:01.233 --> 56:04.278
I mean, dude, that pisses me off.
That's wrong.

56:12.744 --> 56:17.874
[Williams] <i>No matter how hard you work</i>
<i>and no matter how hard you coach,</i>

56:17.958 --> 56:21.170
<i>recruit, encourage, counsel,</i>

56:21.253 --> 56:23.338
<i>there's always somebody
out there to get you.</i>

56:23.422 --> 56:26.800
<i>You know, here's the deal.
It was very disappointing, you know,</i>

56:26.883 --> 56:31.805
<i>to go through a season
and win 11 straight games</i>

56:31.888 --> 56:34.474
and still not able to play
for the national championship.

56:34.558 --> 56:38.228
I mean, it's very disappointing.

56:38.312 --> 56:41.148
But, you know, that's life.

56:41.231 --> 56:44.109
Things happen, you know,
and you got to keep moving.

56:53.618 --> 56:57.872
Final exam schedule.
Here we go. Forward to...

56:58.873 --> 57:03.087
Oh. Louisville, they said they gonna call
and request my transcript.

57:03.170 --> 57:04.463
- [Wagner] Okay.
- [chuckles]

57:04.546 --> 57:06.089
[player] Who you gonna sign with?

57:06.173 --> 57:08.091
Shit. I don't know yet.

57:08.175 --> 57:09.694
[Rodney] Who all you got?
Put it like that.

57:09.718 --> 57:11.487
- Who all I got?
- [player] That's a bad question.

57:11.511 --> 57:16.641
Louisville, Mississippi State, Ole Miss,
West Virginia, South Carolina...

57:17.184 --> 57:19.353
Maryland, Michigan State...

57:19.436 --> 57:21.081
- [player 1] Sign with Louisville.
- [player 2] Roll Tide.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.314
Shit. Alabama trying me.

57:22.940 --> 57:23.941
[blows raspberry]

57:24.024 --> 57:26.401
- [player] Hey, so where you going, bro?
- To the crib.

57:26.485 --> 57:28.695
[Chauncey] So Texas Tech
ain't saying nothin'?

57:29.321 --> 57:31.781
Yeah, they saying something,
but I don't know, bro...

57:31.865 --> 57:33.742
[Rodney] Don't you got, like, 200 tackles?

57:34.618 --> 57:36.536
I don't know what I wanna do, bro.

57:37.704 --> 57:40.082
[Wagner] So did you talk to anybody
after the game? Coaches?

57:40.165 --> 57:42.376
I ain't talk to nobody after the game.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.256
I'm endangerment to society.

57:47.339 --> 57:49.020
[Wagner] Stop saying that. No, you're not.

57:49.091 --> 57:51.301
I'm endangerment to society.

57:51.385 --> 57:53.738
- [Wagner] No. But you're not.
- You were sitting right here,

57:53.762 --> 57:55.406
- when the coach told me.
- [Wagner] You're not.

57:55.430 --> 57:58.100
[Dakota] You wanna know
what every coach came up and said?

57:58.183 --> 58:00.269
- [player] What?
- "Dakota, we like your film,

58:00.352 --> 58:03.022
we're just gonna have to go back
and check with our head man,

58:03.105 --> 58:05.482
our head president to see
how we're gonna deal with,

58:05.565 --> 58:07.026
uh, your little situation."

58:07.109 --> 58:09.486
[Dakota] They hit me with,
"With your little situation."

58:10.195 --> 58:13.198
[Dakota] That's what they hit me with.
Y'all don't wanna be like me, man.

58:13.281 --> 58:16.118
- [Chauncey] Shit. I've been there.
- Don't fuck up one time.

58:16.618 --> 58:19.204
- [Chauncey] I got three under my belt.
- Three?

58:19.288 --> 58:20.723
[Chauncey] Shit.
You didn't look my name up.

58:20.747 --> 58:24.751
[Dakota] Going to jail
for some green, though, is different.

58:24.834 --> 58:27.712
That shit actually getting legalized
in some states.

58:27.796 --> 58:30.049
I'm an endangerment to society.

58:30.132 --> 58:33.301
[Wagner] You made a mistake.
Big freakin' deal. Quit being negative.

58:33.593 --> 58:35.554
I'm not negative. I'm very positive.

58:35.637 --> 58:39.808
I'm just, what's the word? Realistic.
You know what I'm saying?

58:40.392 --> 58:43.478
'Cause I felt like I've done everything
I was supposed to do.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.149
I haven't had straight A's
since high school.

58:48.067 --> 58:49.068
[sighs]

58:55.157 --> 59:01.288
[Buddy] Ed, I need to find out
where we are with our guys, quick.

59:01.371 --> 59:04.208
If anybody needs an emergency course

59:04.291 --> 59:07.086
that we need to take online
to get 'em graduated.

59:07.669 --> 59:10.464
[Buddy] So, let's make sure to stay
with Brittany on the phone

59:10.547 --> 59:13.675
and make sure to get anybody
graduated that doesn't pass a class.

59:14.176 --> 59:17.011
Who, right now, is at risk?

59:17.096 --> 59:19.157
Five guys, but we've just got to get
through this week.

59:19.181 --> 59:21.641
This is championship week
for us in the classroom.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.661
- [Buddy] All right.
- They know it, they understand.

59:23.685 --> 59:25.353
We just have to get through this week.

59:30.609 --> 59:33.003
[Wagner] <i>In the beginning of the year,</i>
<i>I would see on Twitter,</i>

59:33.027 --> 59:36.030
<i>you know, these offers that he had gotten
from some pretty big-time schools,</i>

59:36.115 --> 59:39.284
and then now it's,
I mean, it's D-II schools

59:39.368 --> 59:42.079
that are calling about him
and that have asked about him.

59:42.662 --> 59:45.165
I just...
I think that it's character issues.

59:45.249 --> 59:47.792
You know, I think that
it's everybody not really sure

59:47.876 --> 59:50.545
who they're gonna get
when they sign Isaiah Wright.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.215
[Isaiah] <i>What everybody know,</i>
<i>I'm not a D-II talent.</i>

59:53.298 --> 59:58.178
I got D-I talent,
but people just stopped talking to me.

59:58.262 --> 1:00:02.474
[chuckles] I can't say nothing more
about it 'cause I really don't know.

1:00:02.557 --> 1:00:04.785
- I just know they stopped talking to me.
- [child exclaims]

1:00:04.809 --> 1:00:09.063
They stopped getting in contact,
and it went from there.

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:13.860
[chuckles] ULM, then West Georgia.
That's it.

1:00:15.112 --> 1:00:17.572
All the other ones I had,
I don't know where they went.

1:00:17.656 --> 1:00:19.699
They don't...
They didn't talk to me. They didn't...

1:00:19.783 --> 1:00:23.077
They stopped calling me. Things turned.

1:00:23.162 --> 1:00:28.583
And I did my own thing
and now that's what I gotta do.

1:00:29.251 --> 1:00:31.586
People ask, "You think
your brother's better than you?"

1:00:31.670 --> 1:00:35.840
And I go, "Yeah, he is. I ain't gonna lie.
He is better than me."

1:00:36.591 --> 1:00:38.760
It's hard for a big brother to say,
but, you know,

1:00:38.843 --> 1:00:41.888
<i>when you're watching him, like,</i>
<i>"I wasn't doing that."</i> [chuckles]

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:43.640
Yeah, I believe he's better than me.

1:00:44.183 --> 1:00:45.663
<i>But it's gonna get down to the point,</i>

1:00:45.725 --> 1:00:47.925
<i>you're gonna go to a school
where you don't wanna go to,</i>

1:00:47.978 --> 1:00:50.063
<i>because you're cussing your coaches out.</i>

1:00:50.855 --> 1:00:54.651
[teacher] You got an hour and 15 minutes.
It's 25% of your grade. Good luck.

1:00:56.278 --> 1:00:59.864
[Williams] <i>You know, the one thing</i>
<i>about this game of football,</i>

1:00:59.948 --> 1:01:03.202
if you can play, people will be willing
to work with you,

1:01:03.285 --> 1:01:04.578
take a chance with you.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:07.873
[Williams] <i>But the bigger the issue,</i>
<i>the bigger the problems...</i>

1:01:08.290 --> 1:01:11.793
<i>no matter how talented you are,
you know, some people won't touch you.</i>

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:15.672
Bang. You see that shit?
That's that shit, right there.

1:01:15.755 --> 1:01:17.341
Cash that shit right there.

1:01:24.931 --> 1:01:26.492
[Brian George] Taken your finals and...

1:01:26.516 --> 1:01:28.636
- No, finals start tomorrow. Mm-hmm.
- Start tomorrow.

1:01:28.685 --> 1:01:32.063
Okay. I gotcha.
So, today's, like, study day?

1:01:32.146 --> 1:01:34.566
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Gotcha. Cool.

1:01:34.649 --> 1:01:36.901
[man] How you feel?
Are you gonna knock 'em out?

1:01:36.985 --> 1:01:39.446
[Tim] Oh, yeah.
I ain't got nothing too hard.

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:43.325
The only thing I got hard is math,
and that's it. Only thing I got.

1:01:44.576 --> 1:01:47.495
[Wagner] Gimme your pinkie.
I need to know.

1:01:48.121 --> 1:01:49.122
[Tim] What?

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:52.000
That you are gonna finish
what you have started.

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:54.669
[Tim] Yeah, you saw my grades.
I'm gonna graduate May 5th.

1:01:55.337 --> 1:01:58.673
And get my grades and ball
and get to the NFL and make the millions.

1:01:58.757 --> 1:02:00.957
So I can buy me a piece of land
in England or somewhere.

1:02:01.009 --> 1:02:02.344
- [Wagner] Yes.
- For sure.

1:02:02.427 --> 1:02:04.147
[Wagner]
Here's what I need you to remember.

1:02:04.179 --> 1:02:05.179
Man, here you go.

1:02:06.723 --> 1:02:08.475
- What that is?
- [Wagner] You,

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:14.689
your personality and this happiness
and excitement is fantastic.

1:02:14.773 --> 1:02:15.815
[Tim] Mm-hmm.

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:18.277
It is who Tim Bonner is,
and it is fantastic.

1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:22.489
And don't you let anybody squash
who you are.

1:02:22.572 --> 1:02:23.990
- [Tim] Yes, ma'am.
- You hear me?

1:02:24.073 --> 1:02:25.492
[Tim] Yes, ma'am.

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:31.039
But don't get too comfortable
to where you let it hurt you.

1:02:31.122 --> 1:02:33.667
- [Tim] I won't. I promise, Miss Brittany.
- Okay.

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:36.378
[Tim] I promise you.
You trust me, you believe me?

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:39.423
- I believe in you.
- All right. At least you believe in me.

1:02:39.506 --> 1:02:42.175
[voice breaking] I always will
believe in you. You got this.

1:02:42.259 --> 1:02:44.093
[both chuckle]

1:02:45.679 --> 1:02:46.680
[both laugh]

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:48.723
I'mma change to "nincompoop"
and my nation.

1:02:48.807 --> 1:02:50.576
- [Wagner laughs] Nincompoop!
- [Tim] You heard me.

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:51.685
[Tim laughs]

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:54.938
[man] Whoo! You gonna get that done.

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:57.708
[Ed Holly] <i>Ryan Lee, who has offered you?</i>

1:02:57.732 --> 1:02:59.609
[Ryan] University of Western Kentucky.

1:02:59.693 --> 1:03:02.236
- WKU and WCU, right?
- Yes, sir.

1:03:02.321 --> 1:03:03.863
- Good. Anybody else?
- No, sir.

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:06.950
All right, you're gonna get a bunch more.
Who has officially offered?

1:03:07.033 --> 1:03:08.952
Troy and Bowling Green.

1:03:09.035 --> 1:03:10.370
All right, no problem.

1:03:10.454 --> 1:03:12.335
[Dakota] <i>I wouldn't say discouraged,</i>
<i>I'm just...</i>

1:03:12.414 --> 1:03:17.251
I feel like, personally,
I could compete at a high level,

1:03:17.336 --> 1:03:18.378
you know what I mean?

1:03:18.462 --> 1:03:21.506
And I wanna compete against the best,
you know. I wanna...

1:03:21.590 --> 1:03:24.301
But if it's not meant to be for me...

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:27.762
then God has another plan for me,
you know what I mean?

1:03:28.262 --> 1:03:31.975
[Dakota] <i>Supposedly, Texas Tech,</i>
<i>they have a scholarship waiting on me</i>

1:03:32.058 --> 1:03:36.521
<i>or whatever, but I'm not allowed
to enroll into the school until August.</i>

1:03:36.605 --> 1:03:40.149
Still waiting to hear back from them.
They're trying to appeal that decision.

1:03:40.233 --> 1:03:43.570
So, once I hear back from them...

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:47.741
I'll decide where I'm gonna go from there.

1:03:47.824 --> 1:03:51.160
[player] I told you what I'm doing.
Assembly line and a food truck.

1:03:51.244 --> 1:03:52.329
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:03:52.412 --> 1:03:54.492
- We're going to get our degree.
- [player] That too.

1:03:54.539 --> 1:03:55.624
[Wood] <i>All right, man.</i>

1:03:55.707 --> 1:03:57.143
[Wood] Let's talk. Let's see what you got.

1:03:57.167 --> 1:04:00.128
I know I talked to you earlier,
and I've talked to you throughout.

1:04:00.211 --> 1:04:02.797
Any other visits
or anything set right now?

1:04:03.590 --> 1:04:06.718
[De'Andre] Uh, not in stone, but...

1:04:07.594 --> 1:04:09.429
[Wood] Okay, all right.

1:04:09.513 --> 1:04:11.031
All right, so you're looking at anything

1:04:11.055 --> 1:04:13.350
that you can get.
December grad still, correct?

1:04:13.433 --> 1:04:14.684
[De'Andre] Correct.

1:04:14.768 --> 1:04:16.528
[De'Andre]
<i>Hopefully something comes through.</i>

1:04:16.561 --> 1:04:20.399
If not, then I'll have to take the route,
you know...

1:04:20.482 --> 1:04:22.692
Take whichever route God positions
with me.

1:04:22.776 --> 1:04:24.403
- Mm-hmm.
- So, it is what it is.

1:04:24.486 --> 1:04:27.781
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Man, let's definitely stay in touch, okay?

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:28.984
- All right.
- 'Cause, again,

1:04:29.032 --> 1:04:30.659
you got a home with us, for sure.

1:04:30.742 --> 1:04:33.703
So, I'm gonna be rooting for you,
'cause I know what you deserve,

1:04:33.787 --> 1:04:35.748
um, but let's definitely stay in touch,
all right?

1:04:35.830 --> 1:04:37.040
- All right.
- Good to see you.

1:04:37.123 --> 1:04:38.351
- Take care.
- All right. Thank you.

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:40.877
- Ray Rice on everything.
- Thank you. Later.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:43.296
[De'Andre] <i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>where they're going.</i>

1:04:43.797 --> 1:04:45.214
<i>But I don't know where I'm going.</i>

1:04:45.298 --> 1:04:47.801
<i>Everyone told me
since last year, you know,</i>

1:04:47.884 --> 1:04:50.094
<i>"You go to East Mississippi,
and you do your time</i>

1:04:50.178 --> 1:04:53.347
<i>and stay out of trouble and you win.</i>

1:04:53.432 --> 1:04:54.724
Knock out your two years there

1:04:54.808 --> 1:04:57.811
and by the time you come out,
you should be back on top."

1:04:58.728 --> 1:05:00.063
But I'm not back on top.

1:05:00.647 --> 1:05:02.565
[De'Andre] <i>You know,</i>
<i>signing day's next week...</i>

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:07.237
<i>I have one day left out here,
and I'm going home with nothing. Nothing.</i>

1:05:09.489 --> 1:05:11.950
[man on stereo] <i>And what you've done</i>
<i>with your life thus far,</i>

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:14.202

1:05:14.285 --> 1:05:16.329
<i>Is it giving you what you want?</i>

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:20.875
<i>When you look towards the future,
at all that's going on out here,</i>

1:05:20.959 --> 1:05:24.003

<i>I know I need to be
out there in that arena.</i>

1:05:26.798 --> 1:05:29.008
<i>I know I can do more
than what I've been doing."</i>

1:05:29.092 --> 1:05:30.594
<i>See, I say to you,</i>

1:05:30.677 --> 1:05:32.220
<i>- look at your life...</i>
- [panting]

1:05:32.303 --> 1:05:35.098
[man on stereo] <i>...and</i>
<i>if you're not getting what you want,</i>

1:05:35.682 --> 1:05:40.019
<i>you owe it to yourself

<i>85%, they say, of Americans

<i>you owe it to yourself</i>

<i>to start strategically working
to change directions.</i>

1:06:00.373 --> 1:06:02.584
<i>See, but you know what
most people will do?</i>

1:06:03.001 --> 1:06:06.045
<i>Most people will resist change.</i>

1:06:06.129 --> 1:06:09.090
<i>Most people will fight change,</i>

1:06:09.173 --> 1:06:12.886
<i>as if change would be worse
than what they're experiencing.</i>

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:15.472
<i>And life isn't like that.
That's not how you grow.</i>

1:06:16.556 --> 1:06:19.267
<i>So, as you begin to look

1:06:19.350 --> 1:06:22.937

Make sure to count 'em.

1:07:14.197 --> 1:07:15.878
We got 12 out there. You got 12 out there.

1:07:15.907 --> 1:07:18.492
[Wood] You got 12 out there, Coach!
Hey, whoa, whoa!

1:07:18.577 --> 1:07:20.537
- [Buddy] Time out.
- [Wood] Yeah, time out.

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:22.371
- [Buddy] Come here.
- [Wood] No, you're 11.

1:07:22.455 --> 1:07:23.790
[Wood] Somebody just ran off.

1:07:23.873 --> 1:07:25.750
[Buddy] No, by God, we had 12.

1:07:25.834 --> 1:07:28.127
- [Wood] You did? I thought we did...
- [Buddy] No, no.

1:07:28.211 --> 1:07:30.672
Bullshit.
You had two guys that had already cleared.

1:07:30.755 --> 1:07:32.799
Nobody's run off
since y'all said we got 12.

1:07:32.882 --> 1:07:35.802
Nobody, 'cause I walked up
and said, "Time out."

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:37.929
- [Wood] Okay.
- [Buddy] What, you think I'm lying?

1:07:38.012 --> 1:07:40.557
[Wood] Coach, I said okay.
Yes, sir. Oh, yes, sir.

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.602

Dadgum it! Dadgum it.

I mean it.
I ain't putting up with that bullshit.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:54.571
I ain't putting up with that bullshit
now or never.

1:07:54.654 --> 1:07:56.906
[Buddy] Go to the press box.
Go to the press box.

1:07:56.990 --> 1:07:58.992

Huddle up. Huddle up. Huddle up.

- [Buddy] Clint, did you hear me?
- [coach] He's okay.

1:08:03.496 --> 1:08:04.998
It's all right. Buddy, he's fine.

1:08:05.081 --> 1:08:06.499
[Buddy] No, no, no. No, no, no.

- [Wood] Trey-Right 32.
- [Buddy] I ain't playing.

1:08:16.885 --> 1:08:18.571
- [player] He didn't do nothing.
- [Buddy] No.

1:08:18.595 --> 1:08:20.805
