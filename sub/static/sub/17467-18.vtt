Jill, you'’re a seven, right?

00:03.960 --> 00:05.744

you'’re a four.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.138

00:08.182 --> 00:10.140
I meant your shoe size.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.142
Oh. In that case, yes.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.622
And sorry for snappin'’ at ya.

When you have your hair down

you'’re a solid six.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.541
Thanks.

She'’s got a date
with a hillbilly.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.111
He'’s not a hillbilly.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.721
He'’s taking you
country line dancing,

00:25.764 --> 00:28.115
so he'’s a hillbilly
from the early '’90s.

00:28.158 --> 00:31.161
Hey, it'’s still cool
to line dance.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.945

I'’ve got a date with a
coordinated man who has a penis.

I'’d do the polka, if
that'’s what it took.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.825
Do you even have a clue
how to line dance?

00:42.868 --> 00:45.741
Yeah. You wear cute boots
and dance in a line.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.352
Ugh. Oh, I did not
just hear that.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.920
You are gonna lose that fella

Let'’s show Christy

01:00.538 --> 01:02.801
Shouldn'’t
we stretch first?

01:02.845 --> 01:04.238
I got to tinkle.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.717
No, no time.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.458
The Gamblers Anonymous people

we'’re your friends.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.274
I barely knew the

I wish this was a true

You'’re not sad

No, but you seem to be
snottin'’ it up pretty good.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.635
Okay, I got a little
more information.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.072
She was in the hospital,
she didn'’t suffer,

02:40.116 --> 02:41.291
she went quick.

Oh, Bonnie...

02:43.946 --> 02:45.469
Oh, Wendy!

Oh, Bonnie...

02:56.393 --> 02:58.047
That'’s two!

You don'’t want to find out

You don'’t.

This is all very fresh.

But when you have

03:09.493 --> 03:12.322
you might regret not going

03:16.108 --> 03:17.936
Do not say "mother"!

A mother is someone who sticks
around, day in, day out,

like I did with her.

You know, you might not care
that you lost your mother,

grandmother.

04:07.334 --> 04:10.598
If I kiss your ass,
will you leave me alone?

You do understand we'’re never
gonna see this woman again.

Yes, I would have.

Oh, come on.
Those years we weren'’t speaking,

04:25.221 --> 04:27.267
did you even
think about me at all?

04:27.310 --> 04:28.616
Every day.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.313
Really?
Yes.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.967
You never called.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.362
For 18 months, you didn'’t have
phone privileges.

04:35.405 --> 04:38.887
Give me one good reason
why I should go to San Francisco

04:38.930 --> 04:40.628
and rummage around
that old woman'’s apartment.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.152
And don'’t give me any of that
emotional closure crap.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.763
Maybe you could find
some stuff to sell.

and a VHS player that was--
get this-- built in America.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.521
Aw.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.871
She liked soap operas.

05:06.915 --> 05:10.048
I bet she watched them
to fill her lonely life.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.789
Oh, grow up, Bambi.

05:13.574 --> 05:16.490
The only reason we'’re here
is to find crap we can sell.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.143
That'’s your reason.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.232
I came here to learn
about my grandmother.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.234
Let me give you a thumbnail:
she smoked Camels,

05:22.278 --> 05:24.759
wore clogs, and gave
away her daughter.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.935
Hey, Cranky,
I think you need to eat.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.589
Maybe there'’s something
in the fridge.

05:28.632 --> 05:31.809
Yeah, probably a six-pack
of Ensure and some radishes.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.727
Ooh, even better, a shriveled
lemon and some batteries.

05:36.771 --> 05:40.601
Aw, she liked lemons.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.690
Probably to put in the tea
that she drank

05:42.733 --> 05:45.127
while she watched her stories.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.346
Stop it!

05:49.131 --> 05:50.654
Why can'’t this be like
in the movies,

05:50.698 --> 05:52.656
where I wear a black suit
and a veil

05:52.700 --> 05:55.746
and pretend to cry into a hanky
while a lawyer hands me a check,

05:55.790 --> 05:58.532
and... Oh, my God, you'’re
not gonna believe what I found.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.099
If it'’s a dead cat, lie to me.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.798
It'’s a big bag of cash. Look!

If it'’s a dead cat,
I am gonna kill you.

you were looking out for me!

"We"?
Yeah, "we."

I don'’t mean to pull rank here,
but she was my mother.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.800
You wouldn'’t even know
about the money

down here.

so you could fence her toaster.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.988

The woman lived her whole life,
and all she had to show for it

07:07.252 --> 07:09.516
were a few tchotchkes
and a wad of cash.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.604
And me.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.823
I was including you
as a tchotchke.

a lot more interesting.

Who does that?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.252
I'’ve done it.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.210
Yeah. It works every time.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.256
Except when you get sloppy.
My mother was white.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.518
So was mine.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.912
Look, here.

This is my mother
with my father.

That was weird.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.967
I don'’t know
why I whispered.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.578
We have black friends.

I can show you is a picture

me at when I was four.

got from a lawyer.

Are you saying
you'’re my... sister?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.692
I'’m not sayin'
nothin'’ to nobody.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.695
Unbelievable.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.174
I saw her in the hospital
right before she passed,

08:44.219 --> 08:45.612
and she never mentioned
a daughter.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.178
Just said,
"Look in the freezer."

get this straight.

She kept you?

09:04.282 --> 09:07.634
I guess it'’s not what you want
to hear, but, yes, she did.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.549
Wow. Even from the grave,

09:09.592 --> 09:12.160

to stick it to me.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.162

09:14.205 --> 09:15.946
Why would she want me
to find these?

Eh, you know,
mothers and vegetables.

Yeah, Lorraine.

Put him on.Can you believe this?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.438
She didn'’t want the
girl but kept the boy?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.222
Where are we, China?

09:31.266 --> 09:32.702
Don'’t we have to tell him
about the money?

09:32.746 --> 09:34.051
No! Are you crazy?

09:34.095 --> 09:35.705
But his mom told him
about the freezer.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.360
Yeah, and he got a bag
of peas. Everybody wins.

09:38.403 --> 09:39.666
But now that we'’re sober,

09:39.709 --> 09:40.754
aren'’t we supposed to be
rigorously honest?

09:40.797 --> 09:41.972
Not when it
comes to money.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.194
I'’m sorry about that.
Got a trial coming up.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.196
Oh, really? What'’d
they get you for?

Oh. Well, la-dee-da.

A lawyer.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.117
That'’s so cool.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.423
You know, I'’m actually
studying to be...
Not now.

09:58.467 --> 10:02.384
Listen, I'’m not really sure
what we'’re supposed to do here.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.038
This is my card.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.606
Give me a call
if you ever want to sit down

10:06.649 --> 10:08.390
and-- I don'’t know-- talk.

10:12.176 --> 10:17.094
Well, I don'’t have a card,
seeing as it'’s not 1947.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.314
Is she always like this?

10:19.357 --> 10:21.664
No, sometimes
she'’s in a bad mood.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.145
I can come back another time.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.929
Take whatever you need,

10:25.973 --> 10:28.671
but if you find any pictures
of an adorable black boy,

10:28.715 --> 10:30.281
don'’t throw 'em out.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.719
Hang on.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.459
This makes a lot more sense now.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.331
You threw out
my Little League picture?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.724
That'’s cold.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.639
Sorry. We thought
you came with the frame.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.644
Okay, I'’m just gonna go.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.254
Wait!

10:46.297 --> 10:48.822
We found a bunch of cash
in the freezer.
No!

10:51.172 --> 10:53.827
It'’s only right
if you take half.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.742
How much is there?

10:55.785 --> 10:58.092
About six grand.
$350.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.833
Six grand.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.185
It'’s okay. You keep it.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.708
What'’s that
supposed to mean?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.275
Means I don'’t need it.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.363
And we do?

11:08.406 --> 11:10.191
We do, Mom. We really do.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.497
Here. I got news
for you, little bro.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.456
You can keep your charity.
I have lived my whole life

11:14.499 --> 11:15.979
without any help
from that woman.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.677
I do not need a handout now!

11:19.287 --> 11:21.593
I am so sorry about that.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.161
For someone who wasn'’t
raised by my mother,

11:24.205 --> 11:26.468
she sure is a lot like her.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.731
Never, ever say that to her.

11:28.775 --> 11:32.474
Can you move your foot,
Uncle Ray? You'’re on a 50.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.086
Here. Let me help you
with that.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.001
Thanks.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.961
This'’ll really
help with tuition.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.614
Where'’d you
go to school?

11:42.658 --> 11:44.660
Cal. How about you?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.009
Sonoma State.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.054
Good school?

11:47.097 --> 11:49.012
Ample parking.

11:50.797 --> 11:54.452
You sure you'’re okay with
us taking all of this?

11:54.496 --> 11:56.759
Yeah, I'’m sure.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.414
BONNIE:
And another thing!
Buckle up.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.068
I never even
finished high school,

12:01.111 --> 12:02.896
and she put you
through law school?!

12:02.939 --> 12:04.767
Iput me through law school.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.204
I put me through college,
I put me through everything.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.597
She gave me nothing.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.947
That'’s how I
feel about you.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.299
Everything I accomplished
was in spite of her.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.867
Now I know you had it hard,
but believe me,

12:17.911 --> 12:19.956
it was no picnic
being raised by Shirley.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.349
Abandoned.Black.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.831
Woman.Gay.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.094
I think he wins.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.229
My dad left, and every time
she looked at me,

12:32.273 --> 12:33.491
I was just a reminder.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.928
Oh, that'’s so sad.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.451
What about my story?

12:36.494 --> 12:39.628
It'’s sad, too. I've
just heard it a lot.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.064
You wish you had her.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.415
I couldn'’t wait
to get away from her.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.853
And now I want
to get away from you.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.290
Christy, I wish you
nothing but success.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.118
And she'’ll have it,
'’cause she had a mother

12:51.161 --> 12:52.815
who loved her
and took care of her!

12:52.859 --> 12:53.816
Really?

12:53.860 --> 12:55.600
Yeah, yeah.
He doesn'’t know.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.260
[sighs]

13:03.304 --> 13:05.872
I am so sorry
I dragged you there.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.004
I thought you'’d get
closure with your mom,

13:08.048 --> 13:10.790
and now it'’s
just opener.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.835
More open?

13:12.879 --> 13:14.794
Oh, come on.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.840
Just give me a dirty look
so I know you still love me.

13:17.884 --> 13:18.972
It'’s not your fault.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.712
I know.

13:20.756 --> 13:24.151
I was just making noise
'’cause the radio doesn't work.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.979
This is my life.

13:26.022 --> 13:29.243
I get knocked around,
kicked in the teeth, and then,

13:29.286 --> 13:31.593
when I finally get good news,
like my mother'’s dead,

13:31.636 --> 13:33.682
boom, I get kicked
in the teeth again.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.727
That'’s a funny line.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.339
I'’m gonna steal it when you die.

13:38.382 --> 13:42.299
Enjoy it, '’cause I got
nothing else to leave you.

13:42.343 --> 13:45.172
Oh, stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.261
Everybody'’s life is hard.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.784
Oh, not my long-lost brother.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.742
He apparently
made something of himself.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.571
Hey, don'’t discount
what you'’ve achieved.

13:53.615 --> 13:57.445
I'’m 52 years old, and I manage
an apartment building.

13:57.488 --> 14:00.709
You'’re sticking
with 52, huh?

14:00.752 --> 14:02.624
There'’s the dirty look.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.237
Mom, we'’re all doing
the best we can.

14:07.281 --> 14:10.327
There'’s no point in comparing
yourself to other people.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.763
Thank you.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.855
Especially
a super successful attorney

14:15.898 --> 14:18.683
who overcame poverty
and racial prejudice.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.731
Oh, you do
still love me!

14:25.603 --> 14:28.171
I still can'’t believe
Bonnie has a brother.

14:28.215 --> 14:31.174
I know. It'’s like finding out
there was a Jerry Hitler.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.525
How'’s she handling it?

14:34.569 --> 14:35.918
You know her.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.137
Oh, you poor thing.
Sorry.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.790
Thanks.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.357
Is she coming
to the meeting?

14:40.401 --> 14:42.055
No. She'’s too busy
having a meeting

14:42.098 --> 14:43.970
with all the angry
voices in her head.

14:44.013 --> 14:47.582
Last count, there were seven,
and maybe a dog.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.236
Yeah, well, she needs to come.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.325
You tell her.Maybe I will.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.893
Just be sure to let her smell
your hand before you pet her.

14:57.722 --> 15:00.638
[dramatic orchestral theme music
playing over TV]

15:03.380 --> 15:05.339
TV ANNOUNCER:
As the Sun Sets.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.080
This portion
brought to you today

15:07.123 --> 15:09.473
by Brim Decaffeinated Coffee.

15:09.517 --> 15:13.173
Fill your cup to the rim
with the richness of Brim.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.697
And Lady Whisper Body Spray.

15:15.740 --> 15:19.309
Because... well... you know.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.619
[knocking on door]

15:27.013 --> 15:27.927
[sighs]

15:30.103 --> 15:31.974
[sighs]
What are you doing here?

15:32.018 --> 15:34.107
What are you doing here?Why aren'’t you at the meeting?

15:34.150 --> 15:36.152
I'’m not at the meeting 'cause
you'’re not at the meeting.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.720
You want to play 20 Questions,
or are you gonna invite me in?Fine.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.504
I just don'’t want
to talk about my mother.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.463
You got it.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.728
[sighs]

15:46.771 --> 15:49.818
You know, I had a dead
mom I was mad at, too.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.691
For God'’s sake.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.171
What? I'’m talking
about mymother.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.000
I see. So this is where
we make my problem about you.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.134
Oh, we'’ll get there.

16:01.177 --> 16:04.006
But since you brought it up,
what exactly is your problem?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
Seriously?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.531
My mother threw me
into the foster system,

16:07.575 --> 16:09.098
but chose to raise a son.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.882
Okay. How is
that a problem?

16:10.926 --> 16:13.146
Are you trying to piss me off?

16:13.189 --> 16:14.451
I'’m just saying,
that'’s something

16:14.495 --> 16:15.800
that happened
a long time ago.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.759
It'’s only a problem now
if you make it one.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.370
[scoffs] I didn'’t think
I could hate that woman

16:20.414 --> 16:22.068
any more than I already did.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.114
Can I tell you something
Marjorie told me?

16:25.158 --> 16:26.594
Ugh. Let me guess.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.727
Pray? Go to a meeting?
Pray at a meeting?

16:29.771 --> 16:33.601
Do the hokey pokey,
turn yourself around?

16:33.644 --> 16:36.778
She told me to write my mother
a letter and tell her everything

16:36.821 --> 16:39.694
I didn'’t get a chance
to tell her when she was alive.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.783
And where would I mail
this letter?

16:41.826 --> 16:44.655
Do you happen to know
the zip code for hell?

16:48.268 --> 16:50.661
You go to her grave,
and you just read it.

16:50.705 --> 16:53.273
Wow. That'’s the stupidest thing
I'’ve ever heard.

16:53.316 --> 16:57.929
Yeah, well, I thought so,
too, but... it really helped.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.062
And I had a nice weekend
in South Carolina.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.325
Bought an antique samovar.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.109
I don'’t know what that is.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.849
Is that a person?
A sandwich?

17:05.894 --> 17:08.636
Make all the jokes you want,

17:08.679 --> 17:12.988
but instead of hating
my mom day in and day out,

17:13.031 --> 17:15.556
now the anger just
flares up occasionally.

17:15.598 --> 17:16.686
Like herpes?

17:18.385 --> 17:20.213
I wouldn'’t know.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.648
But yes.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.310
[sighs]

17:43.497 --> 17:46.239
Okay, let'’s do this.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.328
[sighs, sniffles]

17:48.371 --> 17:50.765
"Dear Mom,

17:50.808 --> 17:54.421
"I have hated you my whole life.

17:54.464 --> 17:59.426
"What kind of person
abandons a four-year-old child?

17:59.469 --> 18:02.690
"I wasn'’t a baby, you knew me.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.606
"We sang songs together.

18:05.649 --> 18:09.479
"And then I spent
the rest of my life thinking

18:09.523 --> 18:13.135
"I must'’ve done something wrong,
or you would have wanted me.

18:13.179 --> 18:17.052
"Do you know
what that does to a person?

18:17.096 --> 18:20.403
"I drank because of you.

18:20.447 --> 18:24.364
"I almost lost my child
because of you.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.193
"I went to jail because of you.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.456
[sniffles]

18:29.499 --> 18:33.895
Because of you, because of you,
because of you."

18:39.640 --> 18:43.296
[voice breaking]:
I can'’t keep doing this.

18:43.339 --> 18:48.127
You have been
the great excuse of my life.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.520
I blamed you for everything.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.435
It'’s all on you.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.440
God.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.095
I can'’t believe
I'’m gonna say this, but...

19:03.272 --> 19:05.622
...I'’m sorry.

19:11.976 --> 19:17.330
I don'’t like you--
I don'’t have to like you--

19:17.373 --> 19:20.071
but you'’re not responsible
for my life.

19:20.115 --> 19:22.161
I am responsible for my life.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.210
There.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.604
You'’re off the hook.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.609
Rest in peace.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.159
[quietly]:
"Dear Mom, for as long

20:04.203 --> 20:06.248
"as I can remember, you
were never there for me.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.467
You let me down so..."

20:07.510 --> 20:08.685
What'’s going on?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.905
Shh. Lay down. Just go with it.

20:10.948 --> 20:13.647
What are you doing?

20:13.690 --> 20:15.605
I was inspired by what you did,

20:15.649 --> 20:18.173
and I realized I still have
so much anger towards you,

20:18.217 --> 20:20.262
I thought I should
get some of it out.

20:20.306 --> 20:23.483
Wait. You'’re doing
your dead mom letter now?

20:23.526 --> 20:26.442
Yeah. I was in the mood,
nothing on TV.

20:26.486 --> 20:29.184
Eh, knock yourself out.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.274
It might help if you
crossed your arms.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.145
Like this?

20:34.189 --> 20:36.322
Perfect. And breathe shallow.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.541
[exhales heavily]

20:38.585 --> 20:41.501
Nice.

20:41.544 --> 20:44.155
"You let me down so many times,

20:44.199 --> 20:45.679
and I learned not
to trust..."

20:45.722 --> 20:48.290
Roar![screams] That'’s going
in the letter!
