NYPD, NYPD, NYPD...

ANNOUNCER:
NYPD: 4,

01:14.142 --> 01:16.844
FDNY: 3.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.480
Don't look so smug.
It ain't over yet.

01:19.513 --> 01:23.284
Ah, let's see, osso buco
in a nice red wine sauce,

01:23.317 --> 01:26.487
porcini
mushrooms...
Uh-uh.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.389
And you wonder why the public
likes us better.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.490
You guys are

01:29.523 --> 01:31.425
so cocky.
Oh, come on,
Curtis.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.361
Your boys have won
the last five.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.895
I'm tired of
buying you dinner.

MAN: Damn it!

01:46.407 --> 01:50.911
ANNOUNCER: Firemen tie
the score-- NYPD: 4,

01:50.944 --> 01:53.381
FDNY: 4.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.648
Come on!

01:54.682 --> 01:57.918
Hey, get your head in the game,
kid. You're better than that.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.354
Are you kidding me? Who
just got nailed in the corner

02:00.388 --> 02:02.490
over there, all right?
Get the puck along the boards!

02:02.523 --> 02:03.724
Just keep your skates up
against the post.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.293
You learn that in peewee league.
Hey, hey, hey,

02:05.326 --> 02:07.261
shut up, the two of you.
We are not losing this game.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.729
We got two minutes left.
Danny, I need you

02:08.762 --> 02:09.830
strong on
the forecheck.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.432
Adam, nothing gets past you.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.900
Focus, baby. Focus.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.603
Let's go, boys.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.171
(cheering)

02:17.205 --> 02:19.373
Hey, Flack, that last goal
was for your mother.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.242
This next one's
for your sister.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.511
My sister died
six months ago, jackass.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.547
No. Bro, I didn't know.
She's not dead, you idiot.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.716
Mention my family again,
I'll punch you in the mouth.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.785
(crowd jeering)

02:33.954 --> 02:37.825
CURTIS:
So, how you been?
You feeling all right?

02:37.858 --> 02:40.228
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.830
The last six months have
felt like five years,

02:42.863 --> 02:43.964
but it's good to be back.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.967
I appreciate you coming
by the hospital every week.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.236
That meant a lot.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.771
Ah. Least I could do.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.443
Well, how's Christine?

02:55.476 --> 02:57.845
Please tell me you
haven't screwed that up.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.313
No, no.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.449
It's great.
She's great.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.217
Mary and the kids?

03:03.251 --> 03:05.586
(scoffs) I screwed
that up years ago.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.456
But she loves me.
What can I say?

03:09.490 --> 03:10.758
(players shouting)

03:10.791 --> 03:12.760
DANNY: Come on! I'm here!
I'm here! I'm here!

03:12.793 --> 03:15.329
SID:
Cinema quoi cinema,

03:15.363 --> 03:17.631
I'd have to
say Manhattan.
No!

03:17.665 --> 03:20.601
Yes.
No way, absolutely not.
Annie Hall.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.771
Annie Hall over Manhattan
any day of the week.
Well, Manhattan

03:23.804 --> 03:26.006
has a classic style
and a Gershwin score.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.876
Nah, it's black and white.
No, but it's just...
You just prefer

03:28.909 --> 03:30.778
a more unconventional
form of storytelling.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.614
I guess I'm just more
of a conventional guy.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.617
Nothing about you
is conventional, Sid.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.920

Messer, you suck!

down here and say that?

MAN:
All right, all right, all right.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.008

04:01.041 --> 04:02.976
Annie Hall, for sure.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.347
(organ playing "Charge")

04:14.922 --> 04:17.358
Come on! Get him!

LINDSAY (distorted):

That's the game!

04:38.379 --> 04:40.781
FDNY wins, 5 to 4.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.849
Oh, really?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.651
Come on! Let's go.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.986
Let's go! Come on!

04:56.364 --> 04:57.898
Come on! Come on!

04:58.866 --> 05:00.368
Come on. You want more?

05:00.401 --> 05:02.636
Well, I guess there's
no truth to the rumor

05:02.670 --> 05:03.937
the departments
hate each other.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.110
Il Mulino. 8:00.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.546

Commercial building,
occupants unknown.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.025
10-47, police response
for crowd control.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.728
323, that's just down the block.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.763
(sirens blaring)

05:33.133 --> 05:34.935
Everybody, back up!
Back up now!
Back up!

05:34.968 --> 05:36.670
Everybody, get back!

05:36.704 --> 05:39.473
Get back!
Get across the street.
Let's go! Back up!

05:39.507 --> 05:43.043
Let's go! Let's move! There may
be someone trapped in there!

05:50.584 --> 05:52.886
Joe, you and Kevin
take this floor.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.922
Do a primary search
for anybody trapped.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.825
You don't see anyone, you get
out immediately, you hear me?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.060
Tony...
(speaks indistinctly)

06:02.863 --> 06:04.898
Is there anybody in here?!

06:04.932 --> 06:07.935
Bang on the floor
if you can hear me!

06:16.944 --> 06:18.812

06:19.813 --> 06:21.014

06:21.048 --> 06:23.684
Captain! There's
no one on this end.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.195

06:35.228 --> 06:39.066

07:06.860 --> 07:11.131
* Out here in the fields

07:11.164 --> 07:15.068
* I fight for my meals

07:15.102 --> 07:19.740
* I get my back into my living

07:22.109 --> 07:24.144
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

May our hearts be always ready

07:37.157 --> 07:40.260
if we should be summoned
before our Eternal Chief

07:40.293 --> 07:42.496
in the midst of our labors.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.998
Through our ministrations
to our suffering fellowmen,

07:45.032 --> 07:50.003
we dedicate our lives humbly
to Your praise and glory.

07:50.037 --> 07:53.874
In joy or sorrow, we ask only

07:53.907 --> 07:57.044
that You may be pleased
with our service,

07:57.077 --> 08:01.048
that when the Last Alarm
shall have sounded for us,

08:01.081 --> 08:06.587
we may receive our eternal
assignment with You. Amen.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.790

Present arms.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.095

08:47.828 --> 08:50.831
CHRISTINE:
Nice and slow.
One step at a time.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.838
You okay? You need
to take a break?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.173
(sighs)
I can't remember
what happened.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.143
The thing. I-I can't

09:03.176 --> 09:05.178
picture it in
my head. At all.

09:05.212 --> 09:09.683
Mac, it's totally normal
for you not to remember.
I...

09:09.717 --> 09:13.020
went to the, uh...

09:13.053 --> 09:15.723
Mac.
No, no. I want...

09:15.756 --> 09:18.659
I want to know.
I walked into the...

09:19.693 --> 09:20.761
Pharmacy.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.063
Pharmacy, yeah.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.032
That's it.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.034
That's all I can remember.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.337
There was a guy robbing
the store for drugs.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.974
You shot him, but you
didn't know he had a girl

09:34.007 --> 09:34.875
outside helping him.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.711
She came in, and she
shot you in the back.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.617
You don't have to
do this, you know--

09:43.651 --> 09:45.819
come here every day.

09:45.853 --> 09:49.322
Nice and slow,
one step at a time.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.795
(sighs)

09:54.828 --> 09:58.231
Ugh, I hate you
seeing me like this.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.669
Well, you better
get used to it.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.937
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.314
FLACK: Mac.
He's there right now.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.784
Two unis posted at the scene
just saw him go in.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.951
They have the
perimeter secured.

10:17.985 --> 10:18.986
He's not going anywhere.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.054
(siren blares)

10:33.834 --> 10:36.103
(inhales deeply)

10:39.873 --> 10:42.843
(hammers cock)

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
They only sent two of you?

10:52.452 --> 10:55.288
How disappointing.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.363
So, this is the guy

11:03.396 --> 11:05.999
we've been keeping our eye on
since the fire.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.000
They collared him
back in, like...

11:07.034 --> 11:10.738
'97. They say he was
responsible for ten fires,

11:10.771 --> 11:13.073
but they could only pin
the last one on him.
He gets out

11:13.106 --> 11:15.809
15 years later and torches
the same building?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.277
I know arson's tough

11:17.310 --> 11:19.112
to prove, but he didn't
leave anything behind

11:19.146 --> 11:20.313
at the first nine fires?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.949
Nothing that linked back to him.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.051
They didn't even
have an ID on him

11:24.084 --> 11:26.987
until the tenth fire.
How'd they grab him?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.822
FLACK:
He ran back inside
the burning building

11:28.856 --> 11:30.791
when he realized
someone was still inside.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.892
Come on, please.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.761
Come on, please don't...

11:33.794 --> 11:35.162
Please, please!

11:35.195 --> 11:38.131
Uniforms rolled up on him
giving CPR to the vic,

11:38.165 --> 11:42.002
but it was too late.
(door opens)

11:42.035 --> 11:45.038
(footsteps approach)

11:46.439 --> 11:48.075
The guy who died,

11:48.108 --> 11:50.143
the fireman,
he was a friend of yours?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.281
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry he died.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.315
Yeah, you're so sorry

11:55.348 --> 11:58.485
you went back to the scene
during his funeral.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.088
You couldn't even
let us have that.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.991
You're right. That was
poor timing on my part.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.760
I'm sorry. I apologize.
Two weeks.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.196
You get paroled, it takes you
all of two weeks

12:09.229 --> 12:10.764
to get right back at it.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.731
I didn't do this.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.867
Do you really think
I would be stupid enough

12:13.901 --> 12:15.135
to hit the same building twice?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.805
Your signature is
all over it, Leonard.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.339
Same thing each time.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.209
So don't sit there and tell me
you had nothing to do with this.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.882
1992, '93, '95.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.151
Buildings on Hudson,
8th, and Prince.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.420
LEONARD:
It was never proven

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
I had anything to do
with those fires.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.891
You use wax paper
and dryer sheets

12:37.925 --> 12:39.927
to spread the fire
through the hallways.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.099
We found the same residue
at this scene.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.801
1994.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.036
Corner of Thompson and Spring.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.571
You don't have anything
to link me to that fire.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.174
Fire gel running up the walls
at each scene.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.443
And wouldn't you know it,
we found residue

12:56.476 --> 12:59.412
from fire gel at
this 7th Avenue fire.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.352
Disabled sprinkler system.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.354
You cut the chain
to the OS&Y valve--

13:07.387 --> 13:09.890
every fire you're believed
to be associated with.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.158
"Believed"...

13:11.191 --> 13:13.193
being the operative word.
Look,

13:13.226 --> 13:15.362
don't sit there
and insult me by saying

13:15.395 --> 13:17.197
you didn't do this!

13:20.033 --> 13:22.302
How'd you light
the fires, Leonard?

13:22.335 --> 13:25.472
Some kind of time-delay device,
huh? How'd you do it?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.412
I'm not gonna

13:32.445 --> 13:35.582
conjure fire
from thin air, Detective.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.921
Put 'em down.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.199
Do you smoke?

13:52.232 --> 13:54.167
No.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.269
Drink?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.040
I trust you've
never experimented

14:00.073 --> 14:02.842
with heroin or crystal meth?

14:04.912 --> 14:06.947
Addiction. That's what
it is, an addiction.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.016
Only there's no chemical
in my bloodstream

14:09.049 --> 14:10.650
weaving its way through my body.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.120
The poison coursing through
my veins is psychological.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.123
And the antidote can't be found
in a bottle of pills.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.926
Trust me:
many doctors have tried.

14:18.959 --> 14:23.030
I don't want to do
what I do, Detective.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.532
Every day, every hour,

14:25.565 --> 14:28.902
I battle with my mind.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.337
"Don't do it.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.272
Don't do it.
Don't do it."

14:32.305 --> 14:33.941
And I've won
that battle

14:33.974 --> 14:35.142
for the last 15 years.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.509
Yeah, I'm-I'm confused.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.912
You waiting for some kind
of applause here?

14:38.946 --> 14:40.480
You want me to cry? What?

14:40.513 --> 14:43.383
Let's talk honestly,

14:43.416 --> 14:46.419
shall we, Detective?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.488
We both know you can't
prove I did anything.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.557
Otherwise you would have
arrested me days ago.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.360
You waited to see
if I would go to the scene.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.594
Which you did.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.464
Why would I do that?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.101
Must have known you'd have
people watching the place.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.569
My parole officer knows
where I'm staying.

15:02.602 --> 15:06.173
I knew I would be arrested
within minutes, so why go back?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.674
(inhales deeply)

15:07.707 --> 15:10.243
Because I have
just as much incentive

15:10.277 --> 15:13.613
to figure out
who set that fire as you do.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.083
Someone clearly
wants to frame me,

15:16.116 --> 15:18.385
someone who has waited
a long time for me to get out,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.154
but would prefer that I stay
caged up in that cell.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.124
And you might know
who that someone is?

15:24.157 --> 15:26.593
I'm offering my services.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.998
As a... arson investigator...

15:32.032 --> 15:34.067
...if you will.

15:34.101 --> 15:37.237
To help figure out
wh-who set the fire,

15:37.270 --> 15:38.638
based on the case evidence.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.975
But I have to study the scene.
I have to go back to it

15:42.009 --> 15:45.245
'cause I'm the only one
who knows what to look for.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.363
FLACK:
"Don't do it. Don't do it.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.397
Don't do it"?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.099
The only reason
this wackadoo

16:06.133 --> 16:08.001
hasn't set a fire
in the last 15 years

16:08.035 --> 16:09.202
is because he's been locked up.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.303
What do we
have to lose?

16:10.337 --> 16:14.341
If he's lying, he incriminates
himself in the process.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.510
Arrogance-- it's always the
criminal's Achilles' heel.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.392
All right, so,
when we found you,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.694
what were you
looking for, Leonard?

16:34.727 --> 16:36.429
This.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.700
It's the ignition point.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.176
FLACK:
Yeah, great, genius.
That was a tough one.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.411
Can I lock his ass
up now, please?

16:51.444 --> 16:54.414
Did you find anything here?
Either inside

16:54.447 --> 16:56.183
or next to the hole
in the floor?

16:56.216 --> 16:57.417
TAYLOR:
One of my
investigators

16:57.450 --> 16:59.819
found some kind
of melted metal.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.421
About the size of a dime?

17:03.523 --> 17:06.159
What was it, Leonard?
Have I not earned your respect

17:06.193 --> 17:08.795
enough to not treat me
like one of your project thugs?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.730
You don't have even
one ounce of my respect.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.566
Which is precisely why I'm not
gonna tell you what it was.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.568
You'll use it against me.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.104
TAYLOR:
All right, look.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.305
You're gonna have to do
better than that,

17:18.338 --> 17:21.141
Leonard. I'm still
overtaken with emotion

17:21.174 --> 17:22.775
over your "I have
just as much

17:22.809 --> 17:25.678
incentive to solve this
as you do" speech, so come on.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.847
Well, whoever did this

17:27.880 --> 17:31.418
did their homework,
I will give them that.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.587
Wax paper.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.592
Dryer sheets.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.728
I may have used them,

17:41.761 --> 17:43.663
but they don't necessarily
link back to me.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.599
Melted metal

17:46.633 --> 17:48.535
is part of a time-delay device.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.802
It's an ingredient
in a compact

17:49.836 --> 17:52.839
and simple chain of reactions
that would allow the arsonist

17:52.872 --> 17:56.109
to get out of the building
before it ignited.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.413
(chuckling):
I employed the technique...

18:00.447 --> 18:02.482
once,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.884
and that's all I'm gonna
give you on that.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.353
That's it?

18:06.386 --> 18:08.221
We brought you
out here for that?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.822
Yeah.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.624
This was very helpful.

18:11.658 --> 18:15.128
Perhaps not to you,
but it was to me.

18:16.829 --> 18:20.200
(sirens wailing, horns honking)

18:21.668 --> 18:24.504
MAN:
What's on your mind, Mac?

18:24.537 --> 18:26.573
I'm having trouble...

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
(sighs)
remembering things.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.776
What kind of things?

18:29.809 --> 18:30.910
Like...

18:30.943 --> 18:33.246
things like this.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.882
I know what it does,

18:35.915 --> 18:38.285
I know how to use it,
but I ca...

18:38.318 --> 18:39.919
I can't tell you
what it's called.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.821
I can't recall
the names

18:41.854 --> 18:43.923
of certain foods, colors.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.659
I know the difference
between them, but...

18:46.693 --> 18:48.395
sometimes I...

18:48.428 --> 18:50.430
I can't name them.
You're suffering

18:50.463 --> 18:53.800
from what's called
anomic aphasia.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.470
When you were shot, it
appears that for a time,

18:57.504 --> 19:01.208
your brain was deprived of
an adequate supply of oxygen.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.810
It's likely that
this caused damage

19:03.843 --> 19:07.180
to a particular
area of your brain.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.717
We'll have to do more tests
to determine the extent of it.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.891
I'd rather no one else know.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.793
Of course.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.495
How long do you think
it'll last?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.364
Some cases are temporary.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.400
It diminishes and even
disappears with time

19:27.434 --> 19:28.568
and therapy.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.304
Many times, I'm afraid,

19:31.338 --> 19:33.740
the condition is permanent.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.895
I've got the mayor,
the commissioner

19:55.928 --> 19:57.364
and half
the fire department

19:57.397 --> 19:58.965
calling for answers.
This better be good.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.401
"Good" is definitely not
the word I would use,

20:01.434 --> 20:04.671
but you should see this
before you return any calls.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.779
Triethylaluminum.
It's highly pyrophoric.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.382
It ignites immediately
upon exposure to air.

20:15.415 --> 20:19.386
Used as an additive
for rocket propellants.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.488
Water.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.656
You want to do the honors?

20:26.993 --> 20:28.895
Wow, it's even
more flammable

20:28.928 --> 20:30.530
when introduced to water.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.665
Yeah. It gets worse.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.868
The trace we found in the
room where Curtis Smith died--

20:35.902 --> 20:37.704
it's rubberfrom balloons.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.839
We found several of these
on the floor.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.676
There were also...

20:43.710 --> 20:44.777
Metal eyelets

20:44.811 --> 20:45.812
were on the wall,

20:45.845 --> 20:48.881
running all the way up
to the ceiling, where this

20:48.915 --> 20:50.750
piece of wood was rigged.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.951
It was a trip wire.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.457
He knew the FDNY would rush in.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.867
It was a trap designed
to kill a firefighter.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.778
(clears throat)

21:21.113 --> 21:23.683
(computer beeps)
Adam, you've been
at this how long?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.418
Oh, I'd say

21:25.452 --> 21:27.854
about, uh, three,
four years now. (chuckles)

21:29.656 --> 21:31.791
DANVILLE:
Well, he has to be
in the crowd.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.093
Arsonists are
sick people.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.996
They disregard risk to thumb
their nose at authority,

21:37.029 --> 21:39.566
and they love to
watch their work.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.534
Maybe he doesn't.
I mean, look at Johnny Depp.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.935
He doesn't watch
any of his movies.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.538
Show me what
you got.
All right.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.674
A lot of people in the crowd
with criminal records.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.376
Dirty dozen.
Everything from

21:49.409 --> 21:51.878
public urination
to fraudulent accosting,

21:51.911 --> 21:54.046
also known as running a...

21:54.080 --> 21:57.450
three-card monte
game. Huh, but...

21:57.484 --> 22:00.787
nothing comes even
close to arson.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.590
You, uh, ever been
fraudulently accosted, Jo?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.525
(chuckles)
I had this friend Pete

22:05.558 --> 22:06.993
who was fraudulently
accosted, yeah.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.761
This girl picked him up

22:08.795 --> 22:10.763
at the, uh, Drunken Dog Tavern.

22:10.797 --> 22:11.764
Yeah, turned out

22:11.798 --> 22:13.800
she was a dude.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.468
What up?

22:15.502 --> 22:16.603
Two,

22:16.636 --> 22:17.670
two, three.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.872
That's way out in Brooklyn.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.441
They would've never responded
to this fire.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.942
Adam, run this guy
through the software.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.544
The firefighter?

22:24.577 --> 22:25.077
Do it.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.615
Okay.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.749
Okay.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.157
Criminal Impersonation?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.093
This guy's not even a fireman.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.067
Five years.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.702
That's all I can do.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.937
I'm begging you, please.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.705
I-I can't do more
than five years.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.141
I... just if you could
help me out, I-I...

22:55.174 --> 22:56.509
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.677
Slow down.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.678
We'll get to that.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.647
We don't need to discuss

23:00.680 --> 23:01.981
that right now;
just have a seat

23:02.014 --> 23:04.717
and we'll talk
about what happened.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.854
I can't do more than five years.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.458
Marshall Hilson.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.324
Yes, sir.

23:12.358 --> 23:15.027
Applied to the FDNY in 2001.
Rejected.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.665
Applied to the Yonkers
Fire Department 2002.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.900
Rejected.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.802
Applied to seven fire
departments on Long Island.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.770
Rejected.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.538
All on the basis of
psychological issues.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.673
I'm not crazy.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.540
No one's saying you're crazy.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.841
They are.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.011
They say I am.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.681
Does that piss you off?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.684
Make you feel like you want
to get back at them?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.219
Let's talk about what happened.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.555
(sighs)

23:42.589 --> 23:43.956
It wasn't supposed
to go that way.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.092
You wanted to be a hero.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.127
Set a fire.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.196
Then, be a first responder.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.731
It got out of control.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.099
It killed my friend.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.100
What?

23:54.133 --> 23:55.902
Come on. Let's not draw
this out, Marshall.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.103
No, no, no, no, wait a minute.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.237
You said somebody got killed.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.639
Who got killed?

23:59.672 --> 24:01.173
Nobody got killed.
Curtis Smith.

24:01.207 --> 24:04.110
Captain Curtis Smith,
you son of a bitch.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.845
The one the other day?

24:05.878 --> 24:07.146
On 7th Avenue?

24:07.179 --> 24:08.881
You think I did that?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.852
I wouldn't do that.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.154
I would never intentionally
harm a fellow firefighter.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.023
You're not a firefighter,
Marshall.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.157
It was an abandoned car.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.727
It was on the side of the road.
Two wheels were missing.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.497
It was just supposed
to be a easy, simple thing.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.865
There were gas cans
in the trunk.

24:25.898 --> 24:26.966
I thought I could handle it,
but it...

24:26.999 --> 24:28.968
(knocking)

24:32.939 --> 24:34.173
Don't move.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.608
Five years.

24:35.642 --> 24:36.709
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

24:36.743 --> 24:37.910
You can't do
more than five years.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.179
I got it.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.517
Leonard's in the wind.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.654
What about the guys
we posted at his apartment?

24:47.687 --> 24:50.189
They watched him go in and
then they watched him go out.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.859
He called a plumbing company
and swapped outfits

24:52.892 --> 24:53.893
when the guy showed.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.796
What's up with this guy?

24:56.829 --> 24:57.864
TAYLOR:
He's a waste of time.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.532
The guy's touched in the head.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.767
He's just a buff.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.902
Not smart enough
to have pulled this off.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.170
Leonard's playing with us.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.972
You saw him at the scene.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.307
This "addiction,"
as he calls it?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.809
It's still inside him.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.311
You know, well, I guess
I'm just hoping

25:12.344 --> 25:13.913
that after all these years

25:13.946 --> 25:16.115
he's learned to control
those impulses.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.188
(sirens blare)

25:26.826 --> 25:28.027
DISPATCHER:
All units, all units:

25:28.060 --> 25:31.898
1075 in progress at 152 8th
Street, commercial building...

25:31.931 --> 25:36.803
Got the suspect, Leonard Brooks.

25:36.836 --> 25:37.904
Leonard Brooks found onsite,

25:37.937 --> 25:39.706
and taken by the fire
department.

25:45.912 --> 25:46.879
TONY:
Captain says hi.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.015
Yo, hey!

25:50.917 --> 25:52.251
Enough.
That's enough.
You want some?

25:53.853 --> 25:55.822
TAYLOR:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.592
Back up.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.729
Help him out. Come on.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.534
What the hell's going on?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.637
TONY:
He was just standing there
when we pulled up,

26:10.670 --> 26:11.503
looking all proud or something.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.272
Well, he don't look
proud now, does he?

26:13.305 --> 26:14.273
Are you kidding me?

26:14.306 --> 26:15.374
You don't get to do that.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.709
You don't even know
what happened.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.679
That was in his pocket.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.847
That's all I need to know.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.085
Oh, by the way,
there was another boobytrap

26:26.118 --> 26:27.119
in that building.
You know, if it wasn't

26:27.153 --> 26:28.220
for those sprinkler systems,

26:28.254 --> 26:29.355
we'd be going
to another funeral.

26:29.388 --> 26:32.124
Did Brooks say anything before
you started hitting him?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.059
Yeah, he did.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.861
He wanted to know why
he was allowed to walk

26:34.894 --> 26:36.095
around the streets
after killing my captain.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.097
Your captain was my friend.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.733
You don't get to beat a man down
just because you think

26:40.767 --> 26:42.334
he had something to do
with Smitty's death.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.972
You see that fire right there?

26:46.005 --> 26:48.274
That's what happens when cops
don't take care of business.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.877
Come here.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.111
What the hell are you doing?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.047
I'm taking care of business.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.148
You're under arrest

26:56.182 --> 26:58.017
for assault
and resisting arrest.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.152
Don't move!

27:00.186 --> 27:03.322
FIREMAN:
Copy that. On my way up.
Belt's on the rig.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.157
FIREMAN 2:
That's good. Right there.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.026
Were the sprinklers on

27:07.059 --> 27:09.061
when the first
truck got here?
What?

27:09.095 --> 27:09.996
The sprinklers.
You said they were on.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.764
Were they on when
the first truck got here?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.666
Yes, yes, yes,
they were on.
Thank you.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.701
Yo.
OFFICER:
Yeah?

27:14.734 --> 27:15.802
Put him in the car.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.803
You can't
be serious.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.905
You grab that other mook
over there. He goes too.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.239
Take them back to the house,
put them in the cells,

27:20.272 --> 27:21.407
wait for me there to get there.

27:23.209 --> 27:27.013
You still think Leonard had
nothing to do with these fires?

27:27.046 --> 27:29.081
There should be plenty
of evidence left inside

27:29.115 --> 27:32.318
to tell us one way or another.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.986
If he was involved,
why stick around?

27:34.020 --> 27:36.422
To watch.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.290
Or maybe it's what you said:
it's arrogance.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.226
He thinks he's smarter
than everybody else.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.131
You okay?
Yeah, I think so.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.400
Yeah, it's gonna
be all right.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.817
This valve is normally locked
in the on position.

28:04.851 --> 28:08.220
Someone broke the lock
and turned the system off.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.457
Then, after the fire started
and before FDNY got here,

28:11.490 --> 28:13.760
someone turned it back on.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.695
What, you think Leonard
suddenly grew a conscience?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.900
Maybe he had one all along.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.432
*

29:27.466 --> 29:30.202
So, uh, I ran all
the prints from the scene.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.304
Now, except for a couple
of Leonard's prints

29:32.338 --> 29:34.106
on the sprinkler valve
outside the building,

29:34.140 --> 29:35.441
found nothing in AFIS.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.810
Vent tubing was used to help

29:37.844 --> 29:39.278
the fire travel
from room to room.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.447
They were filled with fire gel.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.050
Same ignition method,
same materials used,

29:44.083 --> 29:46.018
same choreography
as the other fires.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.254
HAWKES:
No prints of value
inside the glove.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.222
But all hope is not lost.

29:50.256 --> 29:53.893
As you always have to use

29:53.926 --> 29:56.829
a gloveless hand to put
on the first glove.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.264
LINDSAY:
I'm hoping that

29:58.297 --> 30:00.967
this sewing kit can get us
somewhere; it's nothing fancy.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.035
It's pretty much standard
issue at a lot of hotels.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.270
But I did find it really

30:04.303 --> 30:07.373
close to the ignition point
and I'm hoping if I can ID this

30:07.406 --> 30:10.409
partial logo, I could maybe get
us a location that connects us

30:10.442 --> 30:12.011
to our arsonist.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.413
Also, I found a sewing needle

30:14.446 --> 30:16.215
near the ignition point,

30:16.248 --> 30:17.483
which is consistent
with the melted steel

30:17.516 --> 30:19.351
we found at the other fires.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.620
Now, we just have to figure
out how you use a needle

30:21.653 --> 30:22.821
to start a fire.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.892
(buzzer goes off)
DANVILLE:
I think your cake's done.

30:31.063 --> 30:32.131
It's looking like got

30:32.164 --> 30:34.100
a few good prints there.

30:34.133 --> 30:38.370
Let's hope
it's the icing on the case.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.406
Really?

30:40.439 --> 30:42.008
Oh, that's pathetic.

30:42.041 --> 30:42.909
Eh, I kind of liked it.

30:50.950 --> 30:55.487
DOCTOR:
Mr. Brooks, do you remember
how you were injured?

30:55.521 --> 30:57.656
A couple of firemen kicked
my ass for no apparent reason.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.258
Do you remember
how you got here?

30:59.291 --> 31:02.294
LEONARD:
Back of an ambulance.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.498
I got nothing to say,
so stay the hell away from me.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.135
What was the address of the
fire doing in your pocket?

31:09.168 --> 31:11.270
Somebody slipped it
under the door of my place.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.339
Who?

31:13.372 --> 31:15.307
I'm guessing the same person who
killed your friend the fireman

31:15.341 --> 31:16.542
and tried to burn
down that building.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.511
Yeah, okay.
What were you doing there?
Same thing as you.

31:19.545 --> 31:23.015
Hoping to run into the person
who's been setting these fires.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.550
TAYLOR:
There's 152 8th Street

31:24.583 --> 31:26.585
in Brooklyn; there's also one
in Manhattan and Queens.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.487
But you knew it
was the one in Brooklyn.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.555
How'd you know that, Leonard?

31:29.588 --> 31:30.957
Was that the address

31:30.990 --> 31:32.524
of the next fire
you intended to set

31:32.558 --> 31:34.026
before you were stopped
and sent to prison?

31:34.060 --> 31:35.394
Very nice, Detective.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.462
Excellent police work.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.496
You should ask for a raise.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.298
But let me correct you.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.166
Because I wasn't stopped.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.700
If I didn't go back
to save that woman,

31:41.733 --> 31:42.534
you wouldn't even know my name.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.570
Who else knew
about that address?

31:44.603 --> 31:45.972
Who else did you tell?

31:46.005 --> 31:50.977
Well, that's the $64,000
question, isn't it?

31:51.010 --> 31:54.580
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
done answering your questions.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.615
Hey.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.450
You better hope you're half
as smart as you think you are

31:58.484 --> 31:59.718
because when you slip,

31:59.751 --> 32:01.287
I'm gonna be there to kick you

32:01.320 --> 32:03.189
the rest of the way
down the stairs.

32:06.758 --> 32:10.462
TAYLOR:
He had to have told someone
about that address.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.631
Been in prison for
the last 15 years.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.500
May have been someone
he met on the inside.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.002
Don't tell me
you're buying that crap

32:16.035 --> 32:18.137
about a fire fairy slipping
a note under his door.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.640
Well, someone turned
those sprinklers back on.

32:21.673 --> 32:25.077
Why would he put out
his own fire?

32:25.111 --> 32:27.246
Maybe there's more
than one person involved.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.249
HAWKES:
Mac!

32:30.282 --> 32:31.750
Just saw you called.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.452
We got a hit off some prints

32:33.485 --> 32:35.487
on the latex gloves
we found at the scene,

32:35.521 --> 32:38.490
and they don't belong
to Leonard Brooks.

32:38.524 --> 32:42.128
Eva Mason, arrests
for arson in Pennsylvania.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.230
On parole, absconded
a couple of weeks ago.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.297
Active parole warrant.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.133
You think her and Leonard
were working together?

32:47.166 --> 32:47.966
HAWKES:
Maybe.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.202
She visited him
in prison a few times

32:50.236 --> 32:51.503
about seven or eight years ago.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.005
Interviewed him
on three separate occasions

32:53.039 --> 32:55.107
and wrote several letters
after that.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.442
She was a psychology major,

32:56.475 --> 32:58.677
doing a research study
on arsonists and pyromaniacs.

32:58.710 --> 32:59.778
Three interviews?

32:59.811 --> 33:02.214
Probably got to know him
pretty well.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.282
We have a location on her?

33:03.315 --> 33:05.651
Yeah, Lindsay ID'd the logo
on that sewing kit.

33:08.287 --> 33:11.690
Kit came from the River
Peak Motel on the West Side.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.060
She got a room around the time

33:14.093 --> 33:15.361
she went AWOL from Pennsylvania.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.762
Jo is hitting the door

33:16.795 --> 33:19.431
with ESU as we speak.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.045
Do it.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.484
OFFICER:
Clear.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.220
Clear. Clear!

33:41.253 --> 33:42.354
What the...?

33:54.300 --> 33:56.602
This girl was definitely,
uh, the president

33:56.635 --> 33:58.604
of his fan club.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.650
Odorless, colorless liquid.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.185
If I had to guess, I'd say

34:13.219 --> 34:14.719
glycerin.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.655
These must be all the
components she used to build

34:16.688 --> 34:17.822
her ignition devices.

34:17.856 --> 34:21.293
Same ones Brook used
to set his fires.

34:23.329 --> 34:26.331
DANVILLE:
Oh, my. This is a live feed.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.199
She was watching him.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.502
EVA: Don't turn
on the light.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.572
What the hell
took you so long?

34:33.605 --> 34:35.607
Is that her?

34:35.641 --> 34:38.444
Go! Get in the chair!

34:39.777 --> 34:42.514
(dialing)

34:42.547 --> 34:45.484
Mac, get over to Brooks' place
as fast as you can.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.186
Eva Mason's
not working with him.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.487
She's gonna kill him.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.895
(sirens wailing, horns honking)

34:56.928 --> 34:58.430
EVA:
Don't you lie to me!

34:58.464 --> 35:02.868
I'll put this bullet
right in your face.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.603
The news said you were

35:04.636 --> 35:06.305
cooperating with the police.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.740
I didn't want to believe it,
but then I saw you out there.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.743
Why would you do that?!
Why would you turn
those sprinklers

35:11.777 --> 35:13.812
back on?!
I-I wanted
to stop you,

35:13.845 --> 35:15.814
to save you from the life I had!

35:15.847 --> 35:18.250
It's 15 years spent

35:18.284 --> 35:20.852
in a filthy prison cell
surrounded by animals!

35:20.886 --> 35:23.922
It's okay to feel these things;
you don't have to act on them.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.657
There are people
that can help you.

35:25.691 --> 35:26.725
(crying):
Help me?

35:26.758 --> 35:27.759
Yeah.
Save me?

35:27.793 --> 35:29.328
I did this for you!

35:29.361 --> 35:30.396
Okay.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.530
I waited for you.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.633
I wanted to show you;
I wanted you to be proud of me.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.934
What the hell
are you talking about?

35:35.967 --> 35:36.935
I don't even know you.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.371
(Eva yells)

35:39.405 --> 35:42.541
Don't you ever say that to me!

35:42.574 --> 35:43.909
You know me!

35:43.942 --> 35:45.777
You're the only one
that knows me,

35:45.811 --> 35:47.279
because you're
just like me.

35:47.313 --> 35:50.716
Fire is the only thing
you think about.

35:50.749 --> 35:54.253
The way it looks,
the way it smells,

35:54.286 --> 35:56.488
the way it moves--
those were your words!

35:56.522 --> 35:58.790
That's what you said!
That's what you told me!

35:58.824 --> 36:02.661
I s-said that, but I-I...
never tried to hurt people.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.630
Don't tell me
you didn't fantasize about it.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.964
You just didn't have the balls

36:05.997 --> 36:08.200
to do it!

36:22.281 --> 36:24.583
(gas hissing)

36:27.353 --> 36:28.487
I didn't tell the
police about you.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.456
Shut up!
If I wanted to hurt you...

36:30.489 --> 36:31.890
(panting):
Don't you lie to me!

36:31.923 --> 36:33.959
You went with them
back in the building

36:33.992 --> 36:36.262
where the fireman died;
I saw you!

36:36.295 --> 36:38.397
I needed to know
that it was you!

36:38.430 --> 36:40.966
Shut up!
(sobbing)

36:40.999 --> 36:43.902
You're just like them,
and you need to die

36:43.935 --> 36:45.571
just like them!

36:46.972 --> 36:48.940
And the last thing you see...

36:48.974 --> 36:51.977
will be the thing you love most.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.386
(electrical buzzing)

37:07.326 --> 37:08.694
(gasps)

37:08.727 --> 37:12.364
(yelling)

37:14.366 --> 37:15.734
(Eva crying loudly)

37:15.767 --> 37:17.303
(gas hissing)

37:17.336 --> 37:19.605
(Eva gasping, crying)

37:19.638 --> 37:21.573
(screams)

37:22.474 --> 37:23.775
(electrical buzzing)

37:26.378 --> 37:27.813
(explosion)

37:27.846 --> 37:29.848
(tires screech)

37:29.881 --> 37:31.983
(Leonard groaning loudly)

37:33.352 --> 37:34.986
(continues groaning)

37:35.020 --> 37:37.889
(car alarms blaring)

37:37.923 --> 37:39.458
Where is she?!

38:00.412 --> 38:02.414
(panting quietly)

38:15.461 --> 38:17.863
This was all that was
left of your property,

38:17.896 --> 38:20.332
Leonard.

38:20.366 --> 38:22.368
I'm sorry.

38:23.469 --> 38:26.071
LEONARD:
Guess when you don't have much,

38:26.104 --> 38:27.839
you don't have much to lose.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.842
TAYLOR:
Potassium
permanganate...

38:33.078 --> 38:34.880
...mixed with
water becomes

38:34.913 --> 38:38.750
an astringent antiseptic.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.453
But mixed
with glycerin...

38:45.023 --> 38:48.360
...and exposed to oxygen,
it strips electrons

38:48.394 --> 38:52.330
from the glycerin so violently
that it creates a flame.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.834
Takes about 30 seconds

38:55.867 --> 38:57.769
for the reaction to occur.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.944
DANVILLE:
We found

39:05.977 --> 39:08.780
these materials
in Eva Mason's motel room.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.850
I didn't get many visitors
in those 15 years.

39:11.883 --> 39:15.787
I guess I boasted
a bit too much when I did.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.689
Well, Eva Mason
listened very well.

39:17.723 --> 39:20.792
LEONARD: She was
a bright, charming,

39:20.826 --> 39:23.562
well-adjusted young woman
all those years ago.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.865
A student drawn
to the subject matter.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.935
Nothing like the person
who killed your friend.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.003
I guess I was naive

39:32.037 --> 39:34.706
to think I could save her
from a life in prison.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.874
It's where she belonged.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.615
I know you still have
those feelings, Leonard.

39:43.649 --> 39:46.485
You don't have to
give in to them.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.455
You don't have to go back there.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.022
Everything that's happened
the last few days,

39:51.056 --> 39:53.124
maybe you can put it behind you.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.160
Start over.
It's too late
for that, Detective.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.195
(laughs)
I'm never gonna have
the house and the wife

39:57.228 --> 39:59.531
with the two kids, the dog
and the white picket fence.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.668
My past will always follow me.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.637
As it should.

40:05.671 --> 40:07.539
I do still... I have
the urges every day,

40:07.573 --> 40:09.641
and I don't want
to go back to that place.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.778
But...

40:12.811 --> 40:15.080
as long as I can't be arrested

40:15.113 --> 40:17.415
for my thoughts, I won't.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.053
Thank you for treating me
like a human being.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.491
We don't know any other way.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.441
Hi.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.646
Hey, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks

40:47.679 --> 40:49.515
and I don't want
to sound selfish,

40:49.548 --> 40:50.816
but I'm having withdrawals.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.685
For six months
I'm with you

40:53.719 --> 40:55.621
practically 16 hours a day,
and now, lately,

40:55.654 --> 40:58.089
it'd be easier to get
an audience with the pope.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.726
Yeah, but the pope
isn't taking you

41:00.759 --> 41:02.661
to your favorite
place for dinner.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.129
(laughs)

41:07.599 --> 41:08.834
Thank you.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.871
Or... giving you these.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.608
(laughs)
What are these for?

41:16.642 --> 41:20.979
I don't think I ever
officially thanked you

41:21.012 --> 41:23.081
for taking care of me.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.184
There is no gift

41:26.217 --> 41:28.086
or words...

41:28.119 --> 41:31.823
that could ever come close
to saying how much it meant

41:31.857 --> 41:33.825
having you there
by my side

41:33.859 --> 41:36.562
through those
six months.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.864
Every single day
your smile and your love

41:38.897 --> 41:42.834
just pushed me
to work harder, and you...

41:42.868 --> 41:45.637
you lifted my spirits.

41:46.605 --> 41:47.739
So...

41:47.773 --> 41:50.141
two dozen roses...

41:50.175 --> 41:53.078
one for every week
you took care of me.

41:53.111 --> 41:55.113
*

42:02.087 --> 42:04.322
All right, enough
of the mushy stuff.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.692
Let's go and eat.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.093
I'm starving.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.868
You know I have favorite places
all over the city.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.770
Which one are we going to?

42:18.804 --> 42:21.707
Well, you know, the one
with the, uh, the dish

42:21.740 --> 42:24.576
that you like.
Oh, let's see,
that narrows it down

42:24.610 --> 42:26.311
to about 50 places?

42:26.344 --> 42:28.580
You know...

42:28.614 --> 42:31.617
th-the one with the, uh, stuff.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.120
The one with the
chef who, uh,

42:35.153 --> 42:37.188
you always ask him
what the recipe is

42:37.222 --> 42:39.157
and he always leaves out
one ingredient.

42:39.190 --> 42:42.227
Oh, Piccolo!
The truffle rigatoni with
vegetable and sausage!

42:42.260 --> 42:45.063
Yes.
Wow, you made
that difficult.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.998
Do I win a prize?

42:47.032 --> 42:50.301
Well, I think
it's hanging off your arm.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.937
(laughs)

42:52.971 --> 42:54.973
*

43:05.684 --> 43:07.719
*

43:15.126 --> 43:17.362
(gas hissing)

43:17.395 --> 43:20.365
*

43:27.005 --> 43:29.007
*
