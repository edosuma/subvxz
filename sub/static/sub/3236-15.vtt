00:31.600 --> 00:33.512
You can come on out.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.232
It's an actual store.
Mm-hm.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.071
I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner
repair" was a term of art.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.555
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.599
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.433
That good?

01:19.640 --> 01:21.233
Sure.
What about this?

01:21.400 --> 01:23.995
I'll Photoshop that out.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.755
Oh, Nebraska.
What's in Nebraska?

01:34.920 --> 01:37.754
You. From now on.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.672
It's gonna take me some time
to get your new situation fixed.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.153
Until then, you're gonna be staying here.
I got a place downstairs, out of sight.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.553
It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's
comfortable enough for short-term.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.040
How short-term?

01:52.200 --> 01:56.114
Considering you got your face up
on buses and billboards all over town,

01:56.280 --> 02:00.559
I'm thinking, uh, two days.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.433
Maybe three.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.638
Only thing is,

02:05.800 --> 02:07.712
and I don't like to do this,

02:07.880 --> 02:11.351
but, uh,
you'll have a bunk mate.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.558
Oh, yeah? He's still here?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.154
For the moment.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.910
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.318
How's he holding up?

02:26.760 --> 02:28.752
You be the judge.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.191
We will find Hank.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.359
Steve too.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.235
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.437
You have my word.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.240
Sir.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.954
Call it in, get her out of here. Move.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.752
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>

03:45.240 --> 03:47.357
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

03:47.520 --> 03:49.876
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

03:50.080 --> 03:53.596
<i>And I thought, you know, maybe, uh...</i>

03:55.200 --> 03:57.510
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

03:58.040 --> 04:01.078
<i>The music stopped,
and then he was right there.</i>

04:01.240 --> 04:04.995
<i>When he saw the gun, he thought...</i>

04:05.160 --> 04:06.594
Hey, Kenny.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.355
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

04:12.680 --> 04:14.194
Just watch.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.910
<i>He kept saying that, you know,
"You don't have to do this."</i>

04:18.079 --> 04:19.639
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

04:22.320 --> 04:25.677
<i>They high-fived because it worked.</i>
Such a bitch. He won't quit.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.957
<i>Then, you know, we turn around</i>

04:28.160 --> 04:33.280
<i>and there is this kid on a dirt bike</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:35.193
<i>looking at us.</i>

04:36.000 --> 04:37.753
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

04:37.960 --> 04:40.873
<i>That kid that went missing
up in White Horse.</i>

04:41.040 --> 04:42.520
<i>It's him.</i>

04:43.560 --> 04:46.359
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>

04:46.520 --> 04:50.594
<i>Todd, that Opie,
dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>

04:50.760 --> 04:54.993
<i>pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.</i>

04:55.160 --> 04:57.516
<i>This is Todd Alquist
we're talking about?</i>

04:57.680 --> 04:59.478
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>

05:00.160 --> 05:03.597
<i>Boom. Like it was nothing.</i>

05:13.560 --> 05:16.553
Hey, Uncle Jack. Hold up.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.636
We should keep him for a while,
get a couple of cooks under our belt.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.514
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

05:25.720 --> 05:29.350
He ratted you out, personally.
We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.638
Meth? Who gives a shit about meth?
We won the lottery here.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.636
We've got all the money in the world.
You're talking to me about selling crank?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.792
I mean, this is millions,
Uncle Jack.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.192
No matter how much you got,
how do you turn your back on more?

05:47.360 --> 05:51.240
You little...

05:51.400 --> 05:53.551
son of a bitch.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.920
It's that Lydia woman.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.959
You're sweet on her, you little bastard.
Ha, ha, ha.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.916
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?
Hey, it's all about this right here, huh?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.598
Come on.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.276
You can do better.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.913
That one's so uptight, probably
got a wood chipper for a coochie.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.958
Stick it in down there,
you're pulling back a stump.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.436
Oh, what the hell?

06:26.600 --> 06:29.069
Heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

06:32.360 --> 06:36.070
Let's go back and watch some
more of that crybaby rat, huh?

07:31.840 --> 07:34.036
How thick is it?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.354
This is mild steel?

07:39.360 --> 07:40.874
Uh-huh.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.631
No, this would be cash.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.794
What?

08:00.680 --> 08:01.796
Nothing.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.753
Hey, you know what?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.479
Make yourself useful.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.677
Give me a list of hitters,
mercenaries.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.714
Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got "concerns."

08:12.880 --> 08:16.157
Don't worry.
We'll take the time to vet them.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.552
Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.959
Five should do it, providing
they're the right men for the job.

08:26.440 --> 08:31.276
I'm gonna hate myself for asking,
but who are we hitting?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.472
Jack Welker and his men.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.438
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.157
I don't know any hit men.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.710
You know a guy
who knows a guy.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.038
Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.999
I'm paying top dollar.
We'll find them.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.675
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.991
Just for old time's sake?

08:59.160 --> 09:01.550
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

09:01.720 --> 09:02.949
Don't leave.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.033
The way things are now,
some people... Not me, mind you,

09:06.200 --> 09:09.034
but some people might say
you're leaving her high and dry.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.469
Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.793
Some people wouldn't know that as
far as the police are concerned,

09:17.960 --> 09:20.794
Skyler is a blameless victim.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.193
No, no, no. Go ahead.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.397
Get it off your chest.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.313
Go on.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.075
The phone call was
a smart move. Kudos to you.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.074
Odds are it was recorded.
It'll play great for a jury.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.118
It might even buy her
a mistrial.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.600
In a year and a half. Until then, if
they don't have you, they go after her.

09:41.760 --> 09:46.596
There's no point. She knows nothing.
Well, too bad. She's got nothing to trade.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.114
I hate to be a downer here,

09:48.280 --> 09:51.239
but there are two DEA agents
missing, presumed dead.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.831
Think the feds will let that go
because you hit the ejector seat?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.279
First thing they're gonna do, they will
RICO your wife and kids out of the house.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.159
That condo is gone.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.152
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.234
Her picture is probably on TV right now,
next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?

10:07.400 --> 10:10.871
Money is no problem.
Well, I don't mean to contradict you,

10:11.040 --> 10:13.191
but getting it to her, impossible.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.795
The feds are praying
that you'll make contact.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.270
The Internet, the phone,
it's all tapped.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.716
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.590
But every time he tried to get
his nest egg to his granddaughter,

10:24.760 --> 10:26.877
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.714
So you propose what?

10:32.040 --> 10:34.874
Stay. Face the music.

10:35.040 --> 10:41.196
I mean, how much time have you got left?
You walk in with your head held high,

10:41.360 --> 10:44.876
be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan
Detention Center. How bad is that?

10:45.080 --> 10:47.117
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.556
Maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.440
Maybe they let your family stay
in the house.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.832
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.957
God, you think I want to run?!

10:58.120 --> 11:00.680
This is the last thing
that I want.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.833
This... This changes nothing.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.630
What I do, I do for my family.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.917
My money goes to my children.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.151
Not just this barrel. All of it!

11:13.640 --> 11:16.917
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

11:17.080 --> 11:20.596
and I'm gonna take back what is mine
and give it to my children.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.400
And then, and only then...

11:24.280 --> 11:25.839
am I through.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.037
Do you understand?

11:30.840 --> 11:31.956
Everything good?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.713
Define "good."

11:35.400 --> 11:37.676
You're set. Time to go.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.190
You'll be a little longer.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.397
I'm still working on transportation.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.960
Change of plans.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.236
He's coming with me.

11:45.400 --> 11:50.031
No. No, that's not...
We're going together. I can use him.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.510
I'll give you two a minute.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.359
Hey, I'm a civilian.
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

11:58.520 --> 12:03.311
I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun is over.
From here on out, I'm Mr. Low-Profile.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.915
A douche bag with a job
and three pairs of Dockers.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.589
If I'm lucky, month from now,
best-case scenario,

12:08.760 --> 12:11.832
I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.
You're still part of this,

12:12.040 --> 12:15.477
whether you like it or not.
Sorry. I don't think so.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.915
You remember what I told you?

12:25.880 --> 12:28.839
It's not over until...

12:48.800 --> 12:50.473
It's over.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.119
Do you want us to cuff her now?
Would that make you feel better?

13:16.320 --> 13:19.552
Your client admits to...

13:23.560 --> 13:27.634
Her day of reckoning is now.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.750
...by the time this goes to trial.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.794
Is she even listening?

13:37.840 --> 13:39.559
Mrs. White?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.678
Are you following all this?

13:42.880 --> 13:44.951
Do you understand
what's happening here?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.234
Yes.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.198
I understand.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.118
I understand I'm in terrible trouble.

13:57.080 --> 14:01.154
I understand that you will use
everything in your power

14:01.360 --> 14:04.876
against me and my children unless...

14:05.040 --> 14:07.236
Unless I give you Walt.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.711
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.550
I don't know where he is.

14:21.360 --> 14:25.149
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.037
Rack your brain.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.278
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.872
<i>Four-seventeen?</i>

14:49.640 --> 14:51.791
Four-seventeen. No activity.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.440
Ma'am, is there anybody else
in the house?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.280
What about your son?

15:43.440 --> 15:46.638
If I go look in his room,
am I gonna see him?

15:47.520 --> 15:50.354
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

15:51.240 --> 15:54.916
If this guy takes his hand away,
are you gonna scream?

15:59.600 --> 16:01.512
He's at his friend's house.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.512
He's been there all week.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.514
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.479
Please... Please.
Ma'am.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.119
We got a lot of respect
for your husband.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.438
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.959
Okay, we know that you've
been talking to the police,

16:20.200 --> 16:23.034
and that's okay.
You gotta do that.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.999
But you've seen some people.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.156
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.551
The one with the black hair.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.110
You said anything about her?

16:38.760 --> 16:39.989
No.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.353
You sure about that?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.993
I didn't.

16:46.720 --> 16:50.316
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.790
Okay, ma'am,
I'm gonna need you to say it.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.798
I will not

17:03.000 --> 17:07.233
say anything about her. Ever.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.680
I swear.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.959
Okay.

17:19.760 --> 17:24.789
When we leave, you're not gonna go running
to those police officers out front?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.834
No.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.440
Okay.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.080
Okay.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.952
Because you really
don't want us coming back.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.513
Uh-huh. Sure.

18:31.520 --> 18:35.070
Don't. Stay where you are.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.038
We'll talk like this.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.360
Okay.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.151
So that thing that we talked about,
I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house...

18:48.320 --> 18:52.439
You don't have to say the name.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.392
Sure. And it went really good.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.634
I mean, the message was received
loud and clear.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.271
The message? Yeah.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.114
Look, I know you did your best.
I just think...

19:08.280 --> 19:10.112
Hi. What can I get you?

19:10.280 --> 19:12.590
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.229
And I'll need more stevia.
Sure.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.510
The person we're discussing
saw my face.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.040
You're not Western Union.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.193
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.552
Really, if you'd been there,
I think you'd see it different.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.598
We threw a real scare into her.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.834
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.309
So you're not going to have
a problem with her.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.791
I can pretty much guarantee it.
I wish I had your certainty,

19:46.960 --> 19:49.928
but I'm not like you and your uncle.
I'm just...

19:50.028 --> 19:52.513
I'm not used to this kind of risk.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.990
We're gonna have to take a break.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.075
I have 50 pounds vacuum-packed
and ready to go.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.517
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.233
It's 92 percent.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.513
I'm sorry?

20:12.960 --> 20:15.270
Ninety-two percent.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.754
Truly?
Tested it twice.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.391
And it's blue, just like before.

20:23.560 --> 20:28.430
Ninety-two.
That's Heisenberg level.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.912
He's not with you?

20:32.120 --> 20:34.954
Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.075
They're looking for Pinkman.

20:38.520 --> 20:42.594
Well, they're not going to find him. He's
with us and he's not going anywhere.

20:48.120 --> 20:52.558
Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys in
Europe have been begging for, right?

20:58.040 --> 21:02.910
I just think we work together good.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.391
We make a good team.

21:07.720 --> 21:11.316
I think it's kind of

21:11.480 --> 21:13.711
mutually good.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.911
Ninety-two percent.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.594
Unh.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.555
Unh.

21:52.280 --> 21:57.071
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.673
All right.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.275
Let's have a look at this place.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.072
You got about a month's worth
of food on hand.

22:24.280 --> 22:28.240
Most of it is canned goods,
but there's steaks in the freezer.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.996
You got a generator outside,
works on LP.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.760
Ought to be enough in the tank
to last the winter.

22:34.920 --> 22:40.473
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do
for the lights, the TV and the freezer.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.915
That's a wood-burner.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.356
Ought to warm the place up
pretty good.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.830
Plus you can cook on it.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.792
On the TV front,
the reception's pretty much nil.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.520
You got some mountains
in the way.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.554
Weather is right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

22:56.720 --> 22:59.315
but mostly
you'll be limited to DVDs.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.991
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>

23:04.040 --> 23:05.793
Two copies. Hm.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.789
I'm not much of a movie guy.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.352
I'll make a supply run
next month.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.878
You want something else
to watch, put it on the list.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.316
Supply run. Heh.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.314
Fifty thousand dollars
for a trip to Costco.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.800
It's risk.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.911
And risk is what you're paying
me for, not toilet paper.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.756
Risk and a 4400-mile
round trip.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.238
Mr. Lambert,

23:34.920 --> 23:38.516
my clients and I don't usually
have an ongoing relationship.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.957
Normally you and I would have
already gone our separate ways,

23:42.120 --> 23:44.680
but you're you.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.513
Where's the phone?
No phone.

23:50.680 --> 23:57.120
Up here, ice storms equal service
calls, equal you in cuffs.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.836
Internet?
Same deal.

24:00.040 --> 24:04.478
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.072
You want news,
I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.995
Whatever you need, just put it on the list.
Put it on the list. Yeah.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.720
Look, I have business to conduct.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.159
Your business is your business.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.199
My business is keeping you
out of custody.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.353
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.557
Your face is all over TV.

24:28.720 --> 24:33.317
You are the hottest client
I have ever had, by far.

24:33.840 --> 24:38.517
It stands to reason
you've got to keep out of sight.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.952
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.600
Nothing.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.717
There's a little one-horse town
eight miles down the hill.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.116
There's not a thing
on God's green earth

24:51.280 --> 24:53.795
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.440
All I'm saying is...

24:56.200 --> 25:00.114
if you leave this place,
you will get caught.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.393
And I gotta tell you,

25:03.600 --> 25:07.230
if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

25:07.920 --> 25:09.718
I won't be coming back.

25:09.880 --> 25:13.590
That is for my own safety.
You understand?

25:16.080 --> 25:17.594
Sure.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.474
Know how to work
the stove?

25:20.640 --> 25:23.474
The flue can be tricky.
Yeah, I got it.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.432
You paid good money for this.

25:30.600 --> 25:34.150
You got two acres up here,
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

25:34.880 --> 25:40.274
Seems to me just the spot for a man
to rest up and think on things.

25:41.320 --> 25:45.837
If you look around,
it's kind of beautiful.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.513
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.479
See you in a month.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.193
Tomorrow.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.439
Tomorrow.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.271
Oh. Huh.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.556
Come...

28:28.680 --> 28:31.400
Oh, so you're just too good
to eat with the rest of us, huh?

28:31.600 --> 28:34.320
- It's not for me.
- Damn, man, seriously.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.075
That's not my chocolate chip,
is it?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.392
You're gonna spoil him.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.799
Hey, you awake?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.792
Uh, yeah.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.789
We had some Ben & Jerry's.

28:52.080 --> 28:57.439
There's peanut butter cup
and AmeriCone Dream.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.513
I didn't know what you liked,
so I got you some of each.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.993
There you go.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.038
So that batch that you just cooked
was 96 percent.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.672
Kind of figured you deserved
a little something.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.914
Thanks.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.200
Well, better get some sleep.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.317
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.954
Got a whole new batch.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.716
Hey, Todd.
Yeah?

29:55.880 --> 29:59.794
Would you mind
leaving the tarp off tonight?

30:00.560 --> 30:02.074
Well, might get cold.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.630
No, I don't mind. I just...

30:04.800 --> 30:07.076
I just wanna see the stars.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.319
Sure. Okay.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.994
Thanks.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.557
Well, good night, Jesse.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.194
Night.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.760
Okay. Okay. Okay.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.594
Okay.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.395
Come on, bitch.

32:48.440 --> 32:51.080
Go ahead! Do it!

32:52.520 --> 32:55.479
Just kill me now and get it over with,
because there's no way

32:55.640 --> 32:59.156
I'm doing one more cook
for you psycho fucks!

33:18.800 --> 33:21.634
Yes?
Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.280
You're Andrea, right?

33:24.160 --> 33:25.594
How can I help you?

33:25.760 --> 33:28.639
You know Jesse Pinkman?

33:28.800 --> 33:31.998
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his.
My name's Todd.

33:32.160 --> 33:37.872
I'm sorry to bother you so late,
but it's nice to meet you.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.312
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

33:44.480 --> 33:45.834
Yeah, he's okay.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.157
Actually, I brought him with me.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.595
Jesse's here?

33:49.760 --> 33:54.039
Yeah, he's right over there
in that truck.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.075
Where?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.639
No!

34:15.360 --> 34:17.351
Just so you know,
this isn't personal.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.149
No!

34:40.719 --> 34:44.190
Whoa, hey, settle down.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.713
Settle down.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.554
Hey, remember.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.712
There's still the kid.

35:56.120 --> 36:00.114
I brought you a couple of cases of Ensure.
Maybe put a little weight on you.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.509
Jesus.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.234
I can barely read this.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.471
Ah. Almost forgot.

36:05.680 --> 36:09.390
Without a prescription, I had to take
an educated guess and shotgun it.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.069
One of these ought to come close.
Oh.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.392
Did you check on them?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.199
Is Skyler in a better place?

36:19.400 --> 36:22.632
No, she's still at that place
off of Eubank.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.156
Kids are both still with her
for the moment.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.793
There's no court date yet.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.512
The news was talking about a grand
jury, but they didn't say when.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.117
I saw her public defender
on TV.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.556
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.360
Think I got socks older
than him.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.716
What are they doing for money?

36:45.880 --> 36:47.917
She's doing taxi dispatch,
part-time.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.632
Leaves the baby with a neighbor
when she goes in.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.877
I saw her shopping one time.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.474
She looks pretty good.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.075
And she's using her
maiden name.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.836
I wouldn't take that personally,
under the circumstances.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.151
Those working for you?

37:05.320 --> 37:06.993
Yeah, yeah.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.950
I took a run
by your old house.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.435
The auction's still pending.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.478
They put a fence up around it.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.756
They put up a fence?

37:14.960 --> 37:19.079
Seems like the place got to be kind of
a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.

37:19.240 --> 37:23.359
The neighbors complained,
so the bank put up a fence.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.715
You ready?
Hm?

37:34.800 --> 37:36.154
Yeah.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.395
Sorry about last time.

37:43.280 --> 37:48.400
It should go better now.
I watched a couple of YouTube videos.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.473
It's all about finding the vein.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.391
Give it to me. I'll do it.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.633
Here, you do it.

38:14.680 --> 38:18.151
Make a fist. Tight.
There we go.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.233
All right, it's just...

38:22.400 --> 38:23.800
Stick.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.031
That's it. Okay. Hey.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.596
Pretty good.
There you go.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.391
Think I had worse
my last physical.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.069
I will see you on...

38:40.240 --> 38:41.276
Let's see.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.036
Afternoon of the 15th.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.396
Stay a little longer?

38:49.960 --> 38:54.273
Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.553
Two hours?

38:58.600 --> 39:02.037
I'll give you another $10,000.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.760
Please.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.039
Ten thousand.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.998
One hour.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.554
Cards?

39:30.600 --> 39:32.637
All right, well...

39:33.640 --> 39:35.757
The game will be seven-card.

39:38.240 --> 39:44.396
I'll deal,
since you are encumbered.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.959
One of these days,
when you come up here,

39:55.920 --> 39:57.832
I'll be dead.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.031
My money over there.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.036
What happens to it then?

40:08.560 --> 40:13.191
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

40:19.880 --> 40:21.519
Would you do it?

40:26.360 --> 40:28.591
If I said yes...

40:30.360 --> 40:32.352
would you believe me?

40:42.560 --> 40:44.517
You wanna cut the cards?

40:47.360 --> 40:48.840
No.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.673
A king.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.354
Two kings.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.431
<i>Flynn White to the principal's office,
please.</i>

43:54.520 --> 43:56.671
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.194
It's your aunt Marie.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.039
It sounds very important.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.838
You can take it in here, okay?
Okay.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.639
Here he is.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.080
Thank you.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.038
Hey, Aunt Marie.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.839
What's...? What's going on?

44:13.040 --> 44:15.032
Hold on a sec, honey.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.556
<i>Look at those numbers for Denver.</i>

44:19.120 --> 44:21.077
<i>Things haven't gone their way.</i>

44:21.240 --> 44:23.960
Son, it's me.
Please, don't let on.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.079
<i>Carmen is nearby, right?
She cannot know.</i>

44:27.240 --> 44:30.677
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

44:30.840 --> 44:32.115
Yes.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.955
It's so good to hear your voice.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.597
I, uh...

44:44.400 --> 44:49.350
Son, the things that they're saying

44:49.520 --> 44:51.591
<i>about me.</i>

44:51.760 --> 44:56.073
<i>I did wrong.
I made some terrible mistakes.</i>

44:56.240 --> 45:00.473
But the reasons were always...

45:04.240 --> 45:10.316
Things happened
that I never intended.

45:10.520 --> 45:13.274
I never intended...

45:18.200 --> 45:21.796
Listen, son, we don't have much time.

45:21.960 --> 45:26.477
Is Louis' family still
at 4848 Newcombe?

45:26.640 --> 45:30.077
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,</i>

45:30.240 --> 45:34.200
<i>does his family still live
in that same place up on Newcombe?</i>

45:34.640 --> 45:36.154
Yes.
<i>Okay, good.</i>

45:36.320 --> 45:40.599
Okay, he's a good kid.
He's like you. He'll understand.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.554
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

45:43.760 --> 45:47.754
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,
but it's for you,</i>

45:47.920 --> 45:50.594
<i>your mother and your sister.</i>

45:52.040 --> 45:55.078
There's money inside.

45:55.240 --> 46:00.793
About $100,000. Okay?

46:00.960 --> 46:02.679
I think.

46:02.840 --> 46:06.038
<i>It was all that I could fit into the box.</i>

46:06.240 --> 46:07.754
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

46:07.920 --> 46:11.391
If anyone says a word,
the police will take it.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.839
<i>I wanted to give you so much more.</i>

46:25.440 --> 46:27.477
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

46:27.680 --> 46:29.751
Do you understand?

46:34.280 --> 46:35.794
Son?

46:36.760 --> 46:39.673
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

46:43.160 --> 46:45.629
You want to send money?

46:45.800 --> 46:47.632
Yes. Good.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.757
Good, good.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.429
So you'll talk to Louis, right?

46:53.600 --> 46:55.990
You killed Uncle Hank.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.278
You killed him!
Listen. Wait. Wait, son.

46:59.440 --> 47:02.831
No. What you did to Mom... You asshole.
<i>Please...</i>

47:03.000 --> 47:04.320
You killed Uncle Hank.

47:04.480 --> 47:09.032
Listen to me. You've got to listen to me.
Just shut up. Just stop it. Stop it.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.271
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

47:11.440 --> 47:13.352
I don't give a shit.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.591
You need this money.
<i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>

47:15.760 --> 47:17.956
<i>You killed him!</i>
Your mother needs this money.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.430
It can't all be for nothing.
<i>What you did...</i>

47:20.600 --> 47:23.035
Please. Please.
<i>Just shut up. Shut up.</i>

47:23.200 --> 47:25.396
<i>Will you just...? Just leave us alone.</i>

47:25.560 --> 47:26.550
You asshole!

47:27.880 --> 47:30.395
Why are you still alive?

47:30.560 --> 47:33.394
<i>Why won't you just die already?</i>
Please...

47:33.560 --> 47:34.710
Just... Just die.

47:36.680 --> 47:40.390
<i>Wagner hasn't had to be
really stellar tonight.</i>

47:40.560 --> 47:43.359
<i>Made solid saves
back in the first period.</i>

47:48.760 --> 47:52.231
<i>You know, Michael, that's probably...
Going back, look at Wagner's numbers,</i>

47:52.400 --> 47:56.474
<i>you know, it seems like he's one
of the last goalies in the league.</i>

47:56.680 --> 47:59.320
<i>They don't wanna
put pressure on this guy.</i>

47:59.520 --> 48:02.240
<i>Kevin Granato looks to make a move,
had the puck taken.</i>

48:02.480 --> 48:04.278
<i>Denver comes back out
the other way.</i>

48:10.680 --> 48:12.831
<i>...by Graham Melanson off Rycroft.
Who else?</i>

48:14.320 --> 48:16.118
<i>Boy, he's been all over the ice tonight.</i>

48:16.640 --> 48:18.677
<i>DEA, Albuquerque District Office.</i>

48:18.840 --> 48:20.559
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

48:20.720 --> 48:25.272
I'd like to speak to the agent

48:25.440 --> 48:28.911
in charge of the Walter White
investigation.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.831
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>

48:32.880 --> 48:34.553
Walter White.

48:36.600 --> 48:39.991
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

48:40.160 --> 48:44.632
<i>Sir? Sir, are you still there?</i>

48:44.840 --> 48:46.780
<i>...this is not just a
goalie that's out there,</i>

48:46.980 --> 48:47.799
<i>it's a whole team.</i>

48:47.960 --> 48:50.475
<i>Two forty-nine remaining
in the third period.</i>

48:50.640 --> 48:52.836
You ready for that drink now?

48:54.960 --> 48:58.590
Dimple Pinch. Neat.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.315
You got it.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.150
<i>...and Melanson,
with a good look, makes the save.</i>

49:03.320 --> 49:05.437
<i>That's why you need good, solid
breakout passes.</i>

49:05.640 --> 49:09.077
<i>Matt Peterson... Win the draw, Englehart
wins the draw, back to Peterson,</i>

49:09.280 --> 49:13.069
<i>goes behind the net, makes a terrible
breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.</i>

49:13.240 --> 49:16.392
<i>He just winds up, puts it on net here.
Turnovers, turnovers.</i>

49:16.560 --> 49:19.871
<i>When you get turnovers
in the offensive zone, chances happen.</i>

49:20.040 --> 49:21.793
<i>Hopefully it won't happen again.</i>

49:21.960 --> 49:24.031
<i>Turnovers generally...</i>

49:25.920 --> 49:28.355
<i>- I wasn't sure you'd come.
- I'm not staying...</i>

49:28.520 --> 49:32.799
<i>- Is this transfer good on the...?
- Darker than a normal rosÃ©...</i>

49:32.960 --> 49:35.839
<i>For us, it's always been
science first, and...</i>

49:36.000 --> 49:38.037
Wait, would you...? Would you...?

49:38.680 --> 49:40.831
Would you go back,
please?

49:41.040 --> 49:42.759
<i>- ShamWows...
- More of a by-product.</i>

49:42.920 --> 49:43.990
There.
<i>Exactly.</i>

49:44.160 --> 49:46.675
What, this?
Yes.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.797
<i>Butjust yesterday, your charity,</i>

49:49.000 --> 49:51.560
<i>the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz
Foundation,</i>

49:51.720 --> 49:55.191
<i>announced a $28 million grant</i>

49:55.360 --> 49:59.354
<i>for drug-abuse treatment centers
throughout the Southwest.</i>

49:59.520 --> 50:01.477
<i>Charlie, the Southwest is our home</i>

50:01.680 --> 50:05.560
<i>and we couldn't just ignore
what's going on in our own backyard.</i>

50:05.720 --> 50:09.157
<i>But I'm sure you're aware that there
are people who suggest other motives.</i>

50:09.360 --> 50:12.717
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin
of</i> The New York Times

50:12.880 --> 50:15.031
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>

50:15.240 --> 50:19.553
<i>that the grant was
a kind of publicity maneuver</i>

50:19.720 --> 50:23.191
<i>to shore up the stock price
of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

50:23.360 --> 50:28.116
<i>because of your association
with Walter White.</i>

50:28.280 --> 50:29.999
<i>That's not exactly the way...</i>

50:30.160 --> 50:32.152
<i>To cleanse yourselves, so to speak,</i>

50:32.320 --> 50:37.679
<i>of having a methamphetamine kingpin
as cofounder of your company.</i>

50:37.840 --> 50:40.036
<i>Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.</i>

50:40.200 --> 50:43.352
<i>I have to believe that
the investing public understands</i>

50:43.560 --> 50:46.792
<i>we're talking about a person
who was there early on,</i>

50:46.960 --> 50:49.953
<i>but who had nothing to do
with the creation of the company</i>

50:50.120 --> 50:52.589
<i>and still less to do with growing it.</i>

50:52.760 --> 50:56.310
<i>So, what was Walter White's
contribution?</i>

50:56.480 --> 51:00.030
<i>You know, to be honest... Honey?</i>

51:00.240 --> 51:02.391
<i>The company name.
The company name.</i>

51:02.560 --> 51:05.280
<i>We came up with it
by combining our names.</i>

51:05.440 --> 51:06.635
<i>"Schwartz" means "black."</i>

51:06.800 --> 51:10.237
<i>Black plus white makes gray.
Hence Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

51:10.400 --> 51:14.189
<i>Exactly. As far as I can recall,
his contribution begins and ends there.</i>

51:14.360 --> 51:17.273
<i>There are continuing reports
of blue methamphetamine,</i>

51:17.440 --> 51:21.070
<i>considered his signature product,
throughout the Southwest</i>

51:21.240 --> 51:24.597
<i>and some evidence
of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

51:24.760 --> 51:29.277
<i>So my question is,
is Walter White still out there?</i>

51:29.480 --> 51:31.472
<i>No, he's not.</i>

51:31.640 --> 51:35.031
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

51:35.200 --> 51:36.475
<i>I am.</i>

51:37.280 --> 51:41.991
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg
that people refer to,</i>

51:42.200 --> 51:45.511
<i>but whatever he became,</i>

51:45.680 --> 51:48.593
<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>

51:48.760 --> 51:53.039
<i>that we once knew long ago,
he's gone.</i>

51:53.200 --> 51:55.669
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>

52:22.600 --> 52:25.115
Police! Hands! Show us your hands.
Show us your hands.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.760
What's going on?

52:28.320 --> 52:30.152
Let's see your hands!
