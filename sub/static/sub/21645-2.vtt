WEBVTT

00:46.040 --> 00:49.317
You see? She understands German already.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.040
Oh, she's clever, like her father.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.149
And strong, like her mother.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.599
Oh, Victoria, I cannot wait
to educate our children.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.038
I want them to shine like a beacon
of domestic bliss through the London fog.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.752
Children?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.559
Yes, of course.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.074
I would very much like us

01:14.240 --> 01:15.594
to fill this nursery.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.116
I think Vicky is quite enough at present.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.160
Where are you going?

01:28.320 --> 01:30.357
I thought we were going to do the boxes.

01:30.520 --> 01:35.356
Oh, er, I have arranged to meet with some
mathematicians at the Royal Society.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.397
But, if you want, I could
stay and help you.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.756
No, I can manage.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.679
Albert, I want to have a word with you.
With no women around.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.871
People are coming to Coburg all the time

02:18.040 --> 02:20.396
to visit the birthplace
of the King of England.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.473
But I cannot even show
them the Hall of Giants

02:23.640 --> 02:27.236
because the roof is leaking
and I cannot afford to mend it.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.199
I am not the King of England, Papa.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.159
Ah, but you are still from Coburg, Albert.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.156
Do you want to feel ashamed
of your birthplace?

02:36.320 --> 02:40.633
If you had not spent so
much on your hobbies,

02:41.680 --> 02:43.399
I would not need to be.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.718
Am I disturbing you?

02:54.600 --> 02:58.719
Oh, please forgive me,
I know how seriously you take your duties.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.678
Which is why we must talk about the future.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.198
I look forward so much to the time
when your nursery is full.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.031
Such possibilities.

03:14.840 --> 03:20.074
B- But now I see in you and Albert
a chance to fulfil those possibilities.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.630
You are a true Coburg, my dear,

03:22.800 --> 03:27.192
and - like all the women in our family -
pleasingly fecund.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.593
The country will be in safe hands
when you produce a Prince of Wales.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.549
And I don't need to tell you
how important that is.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.000
No, Uncle... you don't.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.070
The machine can carry out
these calculations?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.960
Oh, yes, sir.
It's much faster than the human brain.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.316
Lady Lovelace, will you show the Prince?

03:51.480 --> 03:54.917
So, if you wanted to
calculate prime numbers,

03:55.080 --> 03:57.993
you set up the cogs here,
and the machine...

04:02.080 --> 04:04.470
.. will produce the calculation.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.954
It's, um...

04:09.760 --> 04:11.797
It's beautiful.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.192
There's poetry in it, I think.
The music of the spheres.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.273
As the late noted economist,
the Reverend Malthus, has observed,

04:25.440 --> 04:29.832
"Population, when unchecked,
increases in a... geometrical ratio."

04:35.280 --> 04:38.159
Geometrical... ratio.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.191
I'm not going to ask him.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.793
Yes, he would know.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.395
But I'm not going to ask him.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.395
Miss Cleary has had no clean linen.
I wondered if you knew why, Mr Penge.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.438
Do I look like a laundry
maid, Mrs Skerrett?

04:57.600 --> 05:02.994
- You look like a man who could hold a grudge.
- Me? But I am sweetness and light itself.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.074
So, Miss Cleary, where do you come from?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.960
- The Chiswick Institute, sir.
- No, I mean...

05:10.120 --> 05:11.998
Where do you really come from?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.152
County Cork, Sir.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.789
Well, don't let me catch you with a rosary.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.395
The Royal Palace is no place for papists.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.314
No, only for godless old curmudgeons,
Mr Penge.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.880
Come along, Miss Cleary.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.516
Yes, it's a complicated matter.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.469
Perhaps I should write to the Sultan myself
about the preservation of the Holy Land.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.872
The Prince had the same notion,
Ma'am, while you were... indisposed.

05:35.040 --> 05:39.239
Please forgive me.
I must apologise for my lateness.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.993
I was at the Royal Society.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.880
I went to view Charles Babbage's
engine designs.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.952
Oh, I am delighted you went, sir.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.510
- It's a fascinating experiment, is it not?
- Indeed.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.319
When Lady Lovelace explained to me

05:50.480 --> 05:53.791
that they can use this machine
to do the most complicated calculations,

05:53.960 --> 05:56.680
I have to admit I could hardly believe
a human designed this.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.231
- A female mathematician?
- Only one, Ma'am, at the Royal Society.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.472
But Lady Lovelace...
she's an exceptional woman.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.475
The model that they are building,
it has so much potential.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.120
If Babbage's claims are true,

06:09.280 --> 06:13.194
then one day, computing machines
will be able to do the work of men.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.717
We should do everything that we can
to advance their work.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.520
It's so important for the
future of this country.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.235
We should have a soirÃ©e here at the Palace
for these remarkable minds.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.234
- What do you think, Sir Robert?
- A splendid idea, Ma'am.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.517
The Crown should be seen
to be taking an interest

06:30.680 --> 06:32.751
in the scientific life of the nation.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.320
I agree.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.796
Perhaps we should sprinkle some other
talents to leaven the scientists.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.235
Lord Alfred?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.471
Perhaps La Taglioni would dance for us?

06:42.640 --> 06:44.597
Yes, wonderful.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.320
And you could pick the scientists,
Mr Drummond.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.278
With pleasure, Ma'am.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.156
You like Chopin, Miss Coke?

07:13.320 --> 07:16.279
Uh... Is that what you're playing?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.073
It sounded like moonlight.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.191
Beautiful but melancholy.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.074
Do you play?

07:25.240 --> 07:29.314
I know enough country dances to keep
the company entertained after dinner.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.951
Well, we must try a duet some time.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.080
Wilhelmina, why are you loitering?

07:38.200 --> 07:42.194
Uh, I was just listening to
the music, Aunt. Chopin.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.149
Who seems to have a most unfortunate effect
upon your complexion.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.432
You look like a strawberry.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.996
The Queen asked if you could make some
strawberry tarts for the cultural evening.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.914
She has a particular fancy for them
at the moment.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.072
Like that, is it?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.719
All right, then.

08:13.480 --> 08:18.157
- The Queen is delighted you've come back.
- Well, I didn't have much choice, did I?

08:18.320 --> 08:21.677
Lord Alfred's brother told the club
committee it was their patriotic duty

08:21.840 --> 08:23.194
to send me back to the Palace.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.511
Oh. I am sorry. I didn't realise...

08:25.680 --> 08:28.070
What, that the Queen had me dismissed?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.680
By Royal Command.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.551
Still, it could be worse.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.557
To be the Queen's favourite. Huh.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.038
That's something, I suppose.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.556
I think you're more than
that, Mr Francatelli.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.280
<i>Dear Lord M,
it's time for you to return to the Palace.</i>

09:31.560 --> 09:33.552
Can't you make it any tighter?

09:33.720 --> 09:37.236
- Not if you want to breathe, Ma'am.
- I don't understand.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.311
Majesty, is it possible
that you're to be blessed again?

09:41.480 --> 09:44.757
Don't be absurd, Lehzen.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.632
I've just had a baby.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.394
Good afternoon, Mr Drake.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.912
Welcome, my Lord.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.351
May I present Lady Lovelace
and Mr Charles Babbage.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.512
Your Majesty.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.310
- I have never met a lady mathematician before.
- Neither have I, Ma'am.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.951
That's something I plan to rectify
in the royal nursery.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.919
- You can never start too early, sir.
- Hm.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.829
What a striking woman Lady Lovelace is.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.517
It's so important to have
a mixture of guests, don't you think?

11:17.400 --> 11:20.552
Lord M. I'm so glad you could come.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.191
You know how fond I am
of cultural improvement, Ma'am.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.758
Did you manage to finish
your study of St Chrysostom?

11:28.920 --> 11:32.436
What a good memory you have, sir.
Uh, no.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.751
I fear it may be years before I'm finished.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.151
- I'm too easily distracted.
- Oh, I know.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.438
Perseverance, I find,
is the key to success.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.193
Yes, I'm sure it is.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.114
Your Royal Highness,
you're wanted in the ballroom.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.272
Please excuse me.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.754
Tell me, Lord M...

11:53.760 --> 11:55.479
.. do you find me much changed?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.159
Only for the better, Ma'am.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.356
- Does she have any friends?
- Shh.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.716
May I enquire after the Princess, Ma'am?

12:34.880 --> 12:39.671
She is just like her father.
Only noisier.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.833
The machine solved that for you.
That is remarkable.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.471
The Prince seems very animated
this evening, Ma'am.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.439
Is that... Lady Lovelace with him?

12:50.240 --> 12:53.995
Yes. I believe they talk about
mathematics together.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.153
Indeed. Then she takes after her mother...

12:58.280 --> 13:02.399
.. who was such a blue stocking they called
her the Princess of the Parallelograms.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.634
.. we have shown that the Analytical Engine
could calculate Pi to 125 places - or more.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.111
- I truly believe, sir...
- I think she looks rather pleased with herself.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.636
In that respect, she resembles her father.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.554
He always looks as if
every room belonged to him.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.632
Her father?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.837
She's Byron's daughter, Ma'am.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.117
I thought you knew.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.194
And even the most complicated equations
can be calculated in this way?

13:31.400 --> 13:34.154
I pray you, in your letters,

13:35.120 --> 13:39.319
when you shall these unlucky deeds relate,

13:39.480 --> 13:42.120
speak of me as I am,

13:42.280 --> 13:46.672
nothing extenuate,
nor set down aught in malice.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.311
Then must you speak of one
that loved not wisely...

13:51.440 --> 13:53.397
.. but too well.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.280
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

13:56.440 --> 13:58.238
perplexed in the extreme.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.471
Of one whose hand,

14:00.640 --> 14:02.552
like the base Indian,

14:03.400 --> 14:08.350
threw a pearl away richer
than all his tribe.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.352
That was thrilling, Mr Aldridge, really.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.115
It is a great honour to give
you my Othello, Your Majesty.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.954
Mr Aldridge, may I present
a dear friend of mine.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.352
I have never understood why Othello
has to smother poor Desdemona.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.513
That's because you've never experienced
the green-eyed monster.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.240
Jealousy is a most tedious emotion.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.515
Tedious?
Oh, I think it is more than that, really.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.751
Please, excuse me.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.440
Prince Ernest.

14:57.400 --> 15:02.031
- Isn't La Taglioni wonderful?
- Well, my uncle certainly seems to think so.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.635
A Negro playing Othello.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.352
Whatever next?

15:11.520 --> 15:15.400
I, er... I believe that is
how it was written, Duchess.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.153
Such a bestial play.

15:17.320 --> 15:21.360
Shakespeare and polite society do not mix.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.320
Are you all right, Ma'am?
You look a little pale.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.434
Quite all right.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.313
They are enchanting.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.472
If you come this way,
I will introduce you...

15:45.840 --> 15:49.675
Ah, Victoria, we are just, er,
discussing the new Analytical Engine

15:49.840 --> 15:52.150
that Mr Babbage and Lady Lovelace
intend to build.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.720
An engine?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.280
Well, will it move very fast?

15:56.440 --> 16:00.354
Oh, no, no,
it is not that type of engine, Victoria.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.000
It is, um...

16:02.160 --> 16:05.597
Well, it's a thinking machine.
The value of Pi, for example.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.992
Where exactly did you say
you could get that to, Lady Lovelace?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.231
Into the 125th place, sir.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.837
But what sort of pie
needs to be divided into 125 pieces?

16:15.000 --> 16:19.631
Oh, er... Pi is the symbol that
mathematicians give to the irrational number

16:19.800 --> 16:22.440
used to calculate the
dimensions of a circle.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.276
But you could also use it
to calculate the area of an apple pie.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.996
Pi to make pie.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.271
Very droll.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.274
Or even the circumference
of your skirts, Ma'am.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.434
Lord Melbourne.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.958
Your Majesty.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.873
How are you enjoying your retirement?

16:44.040 --> 16:46.077
Well, I don't miss the House.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.039
I understand you are
in correspondence with my niece.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.914
It's true. In her last letter,

16:53.080 --> 16:56.517
she asked me if the Duchess
of Buccleuch's hair was all her own.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.319
I believe my reply was most invaluable.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.917
There are those who might say
it was ill advised

17:02.080 --> 17:04.675
for a monarch to write to
a former Prime Minister.

17:04.839 --> 17:09.198
I might be inclined to agree with them,
but one cannot ignore a sovereign, sir.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.517
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to get back to my library.

17:17.720 --> 17:21.760
- Uncle Leopold, is Lord M leaving?
- I think he was feeling tired.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.118
Lord M!

17:27.480 --> 17:29.790
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

17:29.960 --> 17:33.032
You were busy, Ma'am,
and... it's getting late.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.716
- You used to be such a night owl.
- I used to be a lot of things, Ma'am.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.071
I hope you will stay in London.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.430
There are so many things I wish to discuss.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.798
No, no, I...
I really must get back to Brocket Hall.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.309
It's orchid season, you know,
and I find they are very demanding.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.440
Good night, Ma'am.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.713
Good night, Lord M.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.160
Albert.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.320
Papa is asking for money.
Did you know?

18:42.240 --> 18:44.675
I want to use my money for good, Ernest,

18:45.760 --> 18:47.240
not to pay for his vices.

18:48.240 --> 18:52.792
Oh, I think Papa's interest in the young
women of Coburg is quite philanthropic.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.119
Well, I think it might be best
if he does go back to Coburg.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.157
Did you see the way
he was ogling the ballerinas last night?

19:01.960 --> 19:03.599
He cannot help himself.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.717
- Do you want me to go back, too?
- God, no.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.598
And, of course, there is now
no reason for me to misbehave.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.595
I would give Papa what he wants, Albert.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.199
It's a matter of principle.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.998
Where would we be without our principles?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.279
Ohh!

19:54.120 --> 19:55.873
Who's there?

19:56.680 --> 19:59.434
Saints preserve us, it's a ghost!

20:00.160 --> 20:02.152
- Oh!
- There's a ghost in the Dresser's Room!

20:04.960 --> 20:07.555
I don't think you need to be
afraid of ghosts, Miss Cleary,

20:07.720 --> 20:09.791
but I wouldn't let Mr Penge
catch you with this.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.078
- He doesn't hold with papists.
- I'm sorry, Mrs Skerrett.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.634
- I should have told you.
- No.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.996
We are all entitled to our
secrets, Miss Cleary.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.590
The commission into working conditions
for children under ten in the mines.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.834
- I have summarised the contents.
- I know, but I wanted to read it myself.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.951
Those poor children,
forced to work naked in the dark.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.713
Really, it's not civilised.

20:34.880 --> 20:38.476
Children that the Whigs were quite happy
to leave underground.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.159
I'm sure Lord M
would have addressed the situation.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.916
Really? I'm not so sure.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.039
Lord Melbourne likes to look up.

20:52.200 --> 20:56.080
He does not like to look down
at the unfortunate people around him.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.630
And whilst we are on the subject,
Victoria, I have to say

20:58.800 --> 21:01.156
I do not think it was suitable
to invite him last night.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.631
- He's no longer my Prime Minister.
- That is exactly my point.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.917
Are you jealous he makes me smile?

21:07.080 --> 21:08.673
What would I have to be jealous about?

21:08.840 --> 21:11.230
I'm merely stating that
Lord Melbourne may be retired,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.756
but he's a Whig and you're above politics.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.152
There is nothing political about it.
I enjoy his company.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.880
Just as you enjoy Lady Lovelace's.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.272
Lady Lovelace is...
is a highly intelligent woman

21:23.440 --> 21:25.238
who is doing the most remarkable work.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.754
And what am I, then?

21:26.920 --> 21:30.709
An ignoramus who has to have things
summarised by her husband?

21:31.840 --> 21:33.911
I think it's time for me to depart.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.960
- You're going out? Now?
- Yes.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.351
It's the annual dinner
of the Statistical Society,

21:40.520 --> 21:43.354
of which, you know, I am a patron.
I have agreed to give a speech.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.792
- I suppose Lady Lovelace will be there.
- I have no idea.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.117
Now, if you will excuse me.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.557
I believe that punctuality
is the politeness of princes.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.559
Albert.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.717
I don't want you to go to dinner.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.431
Is that a command?

22:22.040 --> 22:24.555
Where is my brother this evening?

22:29.280 --> 22:32.114
He's gone to a dinner
of the Statistical Society.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.199
Well, he's missed a fine mousse.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.990
- He likes the music of the spheres.
- Father.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.836
- What a slave to duty Albert is.
- It depends where you think his duty lies, Uncle.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.637
Albert has always had
a weakness for numbers.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.952
I had my toy soldiers as a boy,
and he had his abacus.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.999
Ha!

22:56.120 --> 22:59.796
Please continue.
I just need some air, that's all.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.830
Can I get you anything, Majesty?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.435
Oh, Lehzen, I can't bear it.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.640
I should be pleased, I know, I...

23:28.680 --> 23:30.831
Oh, I feel like I'm going to prison.

23:32.600 --> 23:37.072
Therefore, it is of the utmost importance
that those of us who believe...

23:37.240 --> 23:41.154
the future depends on
the advancement of scientific discovery...

23:42.240 --> 23:46.996
.. should support the work of
Mr Charles Babbage and Lady Lovelace.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.590
So let us find the funds
to build their new engine...

23:52.520 --> 23:55.672
.. and become the leaders of the world
in calculation.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.120
Thank you.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.114
- Your Royal Highness, if I may?
- Of course.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.794
Please.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.198
The Queen is requesting
your presence back at the Palace.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.438
Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.318
- Ooh!
- Watch it!

24:25.480 --> 24:27.073
Mind where you're going!

24:27.240 --> 24:28.754
Sorry.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.112
The Prince is currently too busy.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.712
Tell him I insist.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.952
Sorry.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.912
Your Royal Highness, if I may?

25:16.200 --> 25:19.591
The Prince said to ask you
if that was an order, Ma'am.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.950
- Good night.
- Good night, Your Highness.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.432
Victoria?

26:06.880 --> 26:08.314
Victoria?

26:24.200 --> 26:26.351
Forgive me for being late, Ma'am,

26:26.520 --> 26:29.399
but I did not know
that you would be leaving so early.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.120
I don't need you, Duchess.
I have Emma, as you see.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.749
But it is usual for the Queen

26:34.920 --> 26:39.437
to be accompanied by the most senior
lady-in-waiting on official business.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.911
I am not on official business.
This is a private visit.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.629
I see. It is not in the Court Circular?

26:48.120 --> 26:49.634
No.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.792
As you wish, Ma'am.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.996
Duchess, if the Prince asks you where I am,

26:57.160 --> 26:59.231
tell him I've gone to Brocket Hall.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.553
Close the door.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.480
You have created your own Eden, Lord M.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.956
Yes, it is something of a refuge, Ma'am.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.230
What a peculiar-looking plant.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.679
Oh, yes.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.197
It's the Venus flytrap, Ma'am.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.510
See, the... unsuspecting fly...

28:14.800 --> 28:16.837
.. lands on the leaf.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.235
See? Tighter than a poacher's snare.

28:21.400 --> 28:25.110
Why would anything so deadly
be named after the goddess of love?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.274
Well, I wonder.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.871
Perhaps you'd um...
allow me to show you my collection.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.719
Albert.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.998
There are too many women here for my taste.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.913
Women like that.

28:43.080 --> 28:46.152
Papa, if you do not like the scenery,

28:46.320 --> 28:49.836
then... I suggest you go back to Coburg.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.949
- Your Royal Highnesses.
- Duchess.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.272
The Queen told me
that I should tell you her whereabouts -

28:58.440 --> 28:59.874
if you were to ask.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.511
Oh. Well, then, if I wish to know
where the Queen is, I will ask you.

29:03.680 --> 29:08.072
I... I must confess, sir, that I was
surprised to learn of her destination.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.358
Well, that would be the difference
between you and I, Duchess.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.676
Nothing the Queen can do
will surprise me. Good day.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.035
I have come to ask your advice.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.398
I am no longer in politics, Ma'am.
It would be wrong for me to advise you.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.472
It's not the kind of advice I need.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.792
I want to talk to you about... marriage.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.799
- There, too, I'm hardly qualified.
- Well, I've come to you nevertheless.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.831
I find myself in a difficult position.

29:45.880 --> 29:49.669
I am a queen... and a wife.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.072
And to be a queen, I must rule.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.157
Yet, to be a wife...

29:59.880 --> 30:01.758
.. it seems I must submit.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.877
You are thinking in ways
I could not have imagined until now.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.953
Mr Babbage does
not like to hear me say this,

30:09.120 --> 30:11.760
but I often find the solutions
I seek in my dreams.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.434
Stuff and nonsense, Lady Lovelace.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.513
You find your solutions
in that excellent brain of yours.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.558
- You sound like my mother, Mr Babbage.
- Hm.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.712
But I know the night brings revelation.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.954
- My father was a poet, after all.
- No, I can understand what you mean...

30:25.800 --> 30:27.996
.. I think, Lady Lovelace.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.039
Then you are an unusual man,
if I may say so, sir.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.237
Well, perhaps we are both, um...

30:34.160 --> 30:36.550
Oh, what do you say in English?

30:37.560 --> 30:40.758
Um, out of kilter.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.277
Ah, Duchess.
Just the person I was seeking.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.556
Your Majesty.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.110
I was hoping for an audience with my niece

30:48.280 --> 30:53.719
and I know that you are the Cerberus
that stands guard over her private sanctum.

30:53.880 --> 30:57.430
You flatter me, sir,
but I'm afraid I cannot help you.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.879
The Queen has not yet returned
from her excursion.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.838
Excursion?

31:05.240 --> 31:07.311
To Brocket Hall.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.436
When I was confined...

31:29.600 --> 31:33.037
it was a relief to know
Albert would look after the boxes.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.600
Mm.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.479
But now I feel...

31:37.400 --> 31:39.676
That he would still like to attend to them?

31:40.920 --> 31:45.119
Oh, I see.
You would rather he did not, I assume.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.556
He wants us to have a big family.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.756
As does Uncle Leopold, of course.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.676
But I'm afraid, Lord M. Why does
Albert want us to have more children?

32:01.840 --> 32:05.993
Is it so that I will always be out
of the way and he can be King?

32:07.680 --> 32:11.435
Do you remember when you asked for
the title of King Consort for the Prince?

32:11.600 --> 32:14.240
You said that once people
got into the way of making kings,

32:14.400 --> 32:16.312
they would get into the way
of unmaking them.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.790
Well, there was another reason.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.111
I did not want you to
be overshadowed, Ma'am.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.990
Yes, the Prince is your husband,
but you are the Queen.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.600
He thinks he would do it better.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.753
He wouldn't be the first man
to underestimate a woman, would he?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.279
He is so able.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.711
There are so many things
I've never been taught.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.440
Knowledge is not wisdom, Ma'am.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.030
You have an instinct
for what you must hold on to.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.479
I find it hard.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.033
The other evening,
when Albert was talking to Lady Lovelace

32:58.200 --> 33:00.032
about decimal places, he looked so happy.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.955
Oh, come now.
Such suspicion is beneath you.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.759
Besides, if a man is intent on flirtation,

33:07.920 --> 33:11.436
in my experience,
he does not tend to resort to mathematics.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.957
I have missed you, Lord M.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.951
- You always know how to make me feel better.
- Well, I'm glad to hear it.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.352
- I think I need some air.
- Yes, it is very hot in here.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.716
I fear it is more than that.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.759
You are the Sovereign, Ma'am.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.678
We, your subjects.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.676
Whatever trials you may endure...

33:52.840 --> 33:54.672
.. nothing will ever change that.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.553
Even a royal rat couldn't make off with
a truckle of cheddar

34:11.719 --> 34:13.473
and the Queen's petticoat.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.677
Someone is pilfering, Mr Penge.

34:15.840 --> 34:21.757
I'll make sure to put an armed sentry
outside the larder door, Mr Francatelli.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.315
Uncle.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.755
- Is something wrong?
- No, not exactly.

34:45.560 --> 34:50.679
But my valet overheard the dressers
talking about Victoria's condition.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.753
Victoria? Why?
Has something happened to her?

34:53.920 --> 34:57.311
<i>No, not exactly, but something
will be happening to her,</i>

34:57.480 --> 34:59.312
if you understand my meaning.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.230
Oh.

35:07.080 --> 35:10.391
Well, that is wonderful. I must see her.

35:10.560 --> 35:15.032
Victoria is not here.
I believe she went to Brocket Hall.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.512
Is the Queen back?
I have some papers from the Prime Minister.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.273
She is.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.320
It's been a very trying day.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.313
This might help.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.959
How well equipped you are.

35:53.400 --> 35:56.154
I never go anywhere without my tinderbox.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.513
I must get out of this corset!
I feel like I'm going to burst.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.999
Would you like me to order
some new ones, Ma'am?

36:12.040 --> 36:15.431
Yes. Yes, I suppose it's time.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.072
When were you going to tell me?

36:33.320 --> 36:34.959
Tell you what?

36:36.440 --> 36:38.272
The, uh...

36:39.600 --> 36:43.355
I tried to tell you last night...
but you ignored my messages.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.159
Well, you should have made it clearer.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.835
Well, you should have
come back when I asked!

36:48.800 --> 36:52.953
Instead, you left me at home
with your father... and Uncle Leopold.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.718
So you went to Brocket Hall.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.520
- It's a long way to go in your condition.
- I needed advice.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.832
- Your Prime Minister is in London.
- I did not go to talk about politics.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.993
Are you so naive you do not realise
everything you do is political?

37:05.160 --> 37:08.073
- And what did you do today, Albert?
- I went to the Royal Society.

37:08.240 --> 37:11.870
And are you so naive that you think
everything you do there is mathematical?

37:16.720 --> 37:19.076
- Where are you going?
- I need to get out of this corset.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.232
I need to breathe!

37:28.120 --> 37:32.239
With regular blood-lettings and a diet
of beef tea and Brussels Biscuits,

37:32.400 --> 37:36.394
I feel sure the headache and the weakness
on the left side will dissipate.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.912
Ugly brutes, aren't they?

37:40.080 --> 37:43.994
This one looks uncommon like
the Honourable Member for Bridlington.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.480
Not now, Hunter.
Can't you see I'm with my new friends?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.359
The letter is from the Palace, my Lord.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.789
Oh, yes.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.238
Leave it there, would you?
I'll... I'll tend to it when I'm ready.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.474
Agh!

38:13.000 --> 38:14.878
- Is everything all right?
- It's the ghost.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.555
Over there.

38:32.720 --> 38:36.509
I hope this one is a boy.
I would like a grandson.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.479
You mean Drina's with child again?

38:42.240 --> 38:46.154
I hope, Albert, that in my absence
you will be attentive to Victoria.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.152
Are you suggesting I have neglected her?

38:48.320 --> 38:50.880
No, I... I am saying that Victoria is...

38:51.040 --> 38:55.239
not one of your problems
to be solved by the application of logic.

38:56.160 --> 38:59.153
Your happiness, you and Victoria...

39:00.000 --> 39:02.071
.. means everything to me.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.954
Sleep well, my darling.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.552
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.277
This came for you, Ma'am.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.033
By the last post.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.234
<i>I regret to say, Ma'am,</i>

39:53.400 --> 39:56.234
<i>that I cannot come to
London at the present.</i>

39:56.400 --> 40:00.235
<i>I fear you'll be disappointed,
but I am not the one to help you now.</i>

40:00.400 --> 40:02.437
<i>You must look to the future.</i>

40:02.600 --> 40:05.593
<i>The Prince is a man of great understanding.</i>

40:06.880 --> 40:09.111
<i>He knows, I am sure,</i>

40:09.280 --> 40:13.593
<i>that his work is to support
you, not supplant you.</i>

40:14.360 --> 40:15.953
<i>I know that when you reflect,</i>

40:16.120 --> 40:19.431
<i>you will see that you
must go forward together.</i>

40:20.840 --> 40:22.991
<i>And as for Lady Lovelace...</i>

40:23.160 --> 40:27.154
<i>I suspect you will find
she is more scientist than siren.</i>

40:28.200 --> 40:30.556
<i>Please put away your suspicions.</i>

40:30.720 --> 40:35.397
<i>I would wager the contents of my orchid house
on the Prince's devotion to you alone.</i>

40:37.640 --> 40:40.280
<i>I take the liberty to preach to you
about such things</i>

40:40.440 --> 40:43.399
<i>because I know how painful
the alternative can be.</i>

41:21.880 --> 41:24.076
I'm glad you decided to stay.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.310
I'm sure it must be difficult.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.154
Is it that obvious?

41:32.320 --> 41:35.392
Besides, I am in no hurry
to return to Coburg.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.190
Uncle Leopold wants me to get married.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.239
There is no hurry for that.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.154
Marriage is not as easy as it seems.

41:45.320 --> 41:48.279
That is because you have lost
the harmony between you.

41:48.440 --> 41:53.913
But, if you add just one new note,
look how easily it returns.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.036
You just need to find it.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.192
Your Majesty!

42:35.880 --> 42:39.271
- I have come to see the engine.
- I will ask Mr Babbage to show it to you, Ma'am.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.672
Alas, my son has just fallen out of a tree
and is asking for me.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.958
I apologise.
I do not think it is serious, but still...

42:46.120 --> 42:49.272
- I did not know you had children.
- Three of them.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.911
I think I would have got much further with
my work here had I not been so blessed.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.470
But motherhood is not compatible
with mathematics.

42:55.640 --> 42:59.316
You don't think it's a woman's destiny
to marry and have children?

43:00.120 --> 43:02.680
There are times, Ma'am, when...

43:03.720 --> 43:05.871
.. I wish I had been born a man.

43:06.040 --> 43:09.033
You are not alone in that, Lady Lovelace.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.757
It couldn't have been a ghost, Mr Penge.
Not unless it had a wheelbarrow.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.389
And since when did ghosts
start drinking Madeira?

43:19.560 --> 43:21.199
Madeira?

43:21.360 --> 43:23.920
Hey! Hey! Stop!

43:24.080 --> 43:25.434
Hey, you! Come here!

43:25.600 --> 43:27.751
Oi! Come back here! Stop!

43:30.680 --> 43:33.070
Guards! Arrest that boy!
He's an intruder!

43:33.240 --> 43:35.118
- Oi!
- Get that boy!

43:35.280 --> 43:38.398
What is the meaning of this, guttersnipe?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.951
That's a nice bit of lace, Missus.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.595
Do you remember kissing me here
before we were married?

44:14.520 --> 44:17.831
- Of course I remember.
- Everything was simpler then.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.952
I want to say I'm sorry.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.077
I think I have imagined things... that...

44:33.880 --> 44:35.792
.. were not there.

44:45.440 --> 44:49.593
I am so happy about the baby.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.800
I'm happy, too.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.839
Of course I am, Albert, to have your child.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.112
It's just, it's...

45:02.440 --> 45:05.558
Oh, it's so soon.
It's so soon after Vicky.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.557
Can you imagine what it's like

45:12.720 --> 45:17.351
to swell up like a pumpkin
and have everyone treat you as an imbecile,

45:17.520 --> 45:19.477
just because you've given birth?

45:19.640 --> 45:22.360
It's the schattenseite of our marriage.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.352
The shadow side.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.157
I understand.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.357
Do you?

45:30.080 --> 45:31.673
Do you, Albert?

45:31.840 --> 45:33.797
I didn't spend all those
years in Kensington

45:33.960 --> 45:36.634
shut up in a nursery,
only to be confined into another one.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.759
Victoria... I do not want to confine you.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.434
I know.

45:45.880 --> 45:49.669
I want to be your wife, Albert,
as well as a mother.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.719
I want you.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.791
You have me.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.876
And you will always be my beloved.

46:06.440 --> 46:07.556
Always.
