Once my mother dies and I die
that'll be it,

12:47.683 --> 12:49.518
which is probably for the best.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.812
No more of you? [chuckles]

12:51.896 --> 12:53.689
-That'll be great.
-Oh, thank you.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.642
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

-Oh, hey! You can't be in here!

Why'd you say you can't fly? Who's that
other person you're clearly in love with?

14:57.062 --> 14:59.315
I never said I can't fly,
I said I don't fly.

If you want help with that weather vane
you'll clam up, Hambone!

15:02.276 --> 15:05.112
Fine. Keep your stupid secret
about your clearly dead wife

dumb fear of flying. See if I care.

-Mother?
-Oh, hello.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.339
It's Beatrice.

23:44.422 --> 23:47.425
Yes, that's right.
What a pretty girl.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.554
-What did they do to you? [sobs]
-Oh, hush.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.390
It's okay. I'm better now.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.058
I don't understand.

23:55.142 --> 23:58.812
Love does things to a person,
terrible things.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.063
[sniffles, sighs]

24:00.147 --> 24:03.150
Beatrice, promise me
you'll never love anyone

24:03.233 --> 24:07.237
-as much as I loved Crackerjack.
-I promise. I won't.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.239
Why, I have half a mind...

24:10.031 --> 24:11.867
[truck advancing, beeping]

24:16.329 --> 24:19.416
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
There we go, big boy.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.126
Hey, what's going on out here?

24:21.209 --> 24:22.461
Probably should have warned you,

24:22.544 --> 24:25.005
when these guys tear the house down
it might make some noise.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.173
Tear the <i>house </i>down?!

24:26.256 --> 24:29.634
Uh, yeah. You think I just want
to mope around in a shrine to the past,

24:29.718 --> 24:32.721
getting off on my own guilt
while the rest of my life passes me by?

24:32.804 --> 24:33.763
Pathetic, much?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.641
But we spent the last eight months
restoring this place.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.310
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.312
That's usually a series wrap
on a friendship.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.814
-What is a series wrap?
-Are you serious?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.525
Oh, my God, what am I doing
in this backwash of a town?

24:45.609 --> 24:47.235
Do you even get Showtime here?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.404
-So what was all this for?
-I don't know.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.156
Guess it was just a big waste of time.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.117
But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.327
I don't believe this.

24:55.410 --> 24:59.873
Well, as a great woman once said,
suck a dick, dumbshit. [grunts]

25:00.540 --> 25:02.751
-Where are you going?
-Home.
