00:01.060 --> 00:02.592
Previously on Angel From Hell...

00:02.652 --> 00:03.285
Oh!

00:03.364 --> 00:04.604
I'm so sorry.

00:04.644 --> 00:06.649
No worries. Accidents happen.

00:06.763 --> 00:09.965
I'll bet you're a very sweet person,
Dr. Allison.

00:09.967 --> 00:11.099
How did you know my name?

00:11.101 --> 00:13.301
It's me, Amy, from the farmers' market!

00:13.303 --> 00:15.770
- Who's this Bit-O-Honey?
- I'm Brad. I'm the brother.

00:15.772 --> 00:19.240
Your mother died 412 days ago,
and since then, you've buried yourself

00:19.242 --> 00:22.143
in work, buried yourself in a relationship.

00:22.145 --> 00:23.812
How do you know all that stuff?

00:23.814 --> 00:26.915
Honey, I'm your guardian angel.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.617
He's working on boning your best friend.

00:29.619 --> 00:31.853
Evan and I hooked up!

00:31.855 --> 00:34.923
It's not that I believe you're an angel.

00:34.925 --> 00:37.158
- But?
- I could use a weird friend.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.360
Do they come any weirder?

00:41.131 --> 00:43.098
So, remember that weird woman

00:43.100 --> 00:44.733
from the coffee shop a few weeks back?

00:44.735 --> 00:47.068
- The one who put a sexual spell on me?
- Yeah. Amy.

00:47.070 --> 00:49.671
She's been texting,
so I told her she could meet us for lunch.

00:49.673 --> 00:51.353
Do you think you can keep your flirting
in check?

00:51.432 --> 00:52.448
That was a one-time thing.

00:52.509 --> 00:54.743
I don't usually go for a mid-50s woman.

00:54.745 --> 00:56.911
Hey! Aw...

00:56.913 --> 00:59.014
Sorry I'm late.

00:59.016 --> 01:01.349
Hey, you remember my brother Brad.

01:01.351 --> 01:03.351
Who could forget the hottest
brother since Idris Elba?

01:03.353 --> 01:05.553
You're pretty fly yourself, girl. Mm!

01:05.555 --> 01:08.423
It's happening again. I'm sorry.
And it's a little un-PC this time.

01:08.425 --> 01:09.391
All right, kids, dig in.

01:09.393 --> 01:11.826
No arguing. My treat.

01:11.828 --> 01:14.462
Uh, this is a pizza place...
with their own food.

01:14.464 --> 01:15.897
This is how hungry I am.

01:15.899 --> 01:18.033
Should raw oysters be room temp?

01:18.035 --> 01:19.567
So, Allison,

01:19.569 --> 01:21.202
how's the love life?

01:21.204 --> 01:22.203
Personal. Private.

01:22.205 --> 01:23.538
I'm all about discretion.

01:23.540 --> 01:25.507
You know, last night, I had a lovely time

01:25.509 --> 01:28.043
with a certain vendor from the farmers'
market,

01:28.045 --> 01:30.779
and I will not name names,
so don't even try.

01:30.781 --> 01:32.113
Okay.

01:37.954 --> 01:39.354
Was it the oyster guy?

01:39.356 --> 01:42.524
It was the Oyster King of L.A.! Yes!

01:42.526 --> 01:45.994
And I won't go into
details other than to say

01:45.996 --> 01:47.862
four orgasms.

01:47.864 --> 01:49.497
So, Brad,

01:49.499 --> 01:51.599
what's your O-count these days?

01:51.601 --> 01:54.536
I'm going through a massive dry spell.
Yeah, uh, two months.

01:54.538 --> 01:57.455
Two months?
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

01:57.521 --> 01:58.075
I know.

01:58.141 --> 02:00.175
Oh, come on! Oh, unless, of course,

02:00.177 --> 02:02.410
you're still living in
Allison's converted garage.

02:02.412 --> 02:04.579
Yeah. Still getting back on
my feet after the divorce.

02:04.581 --> 02:06.681
I'll bet it's hard to seal the
deal when the key to your house

02:06.683 --> 02:08.282
is the wide button on a clicker.

02:08.285 --> 02:09.616
I do tend to lose 'em coming around

02:09.619 --> 02:11.252
- the side gate.
- I'll bet you do.

02:11.254 --> 02:13.521
Maybe what you need is a change of address,
my friend.

02:13.523 --> 02:15.557
Allison, it's your turn to share.

02:15.559 --> 02:17.192
Come on. Has it been hard

02:17.194 --> 02:19.861
to get back out there after
the whole Evan fiasco?

02:19.863 --> 02:21.563
How he cheated on you.

02:21.565 --> 02:23.865
With your best friend.

02:23.867 --> 02:26.000
- In your own house...
- I got it. I was there.

02:26.002 --> 02:27.335
Happened to me.

02:27.337 --> 02:28.670
She has been a little paralyzed lately.

02:28.672 --> 02:30.939
No, I have not been paralyzed.

02:30.941 --> 02:32.307
I opened an online dating account.

02:32.309 --> 02:34.209
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah.

02:34.211 --> 02:37.112
I found this really great app
where I can study guys' profiles

02:37.114 --> 02:39.214
and really think about my choices.

02:39.216 --> 02:40.515
Not good for you. And, of course,

02:40.517 --> 02:42.183
you are overthinking this.

02:42.185 --> 02:44.919
What you need to do is turn
off the old decision-maker

02:44.921 --> 02:47.722
and just say... shuck it.

02:47.724 --> 02:49.591
Mmm!

02:49.593 --> 02:51.226
That's delicious.

02:51.228 --> 02:52.494
- I'm going in.
- Attaboy!

02:52.496 --> 02:55.296
I don't... think those are very fresh.

02:56.266 --> 02:58.500
Mm-mm.

02:58.502 --> 03:00.335
Couldn't do it.
My throat literally closed up.

03:00.337 --> 03:01.536
More for me.

03:01.576 --> 03:03.172
S01E03
Go with Your Gut

03:03.238 --> 03:04.716
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

03:04.795 --> 03:06.574
You got to go with your gut more, kid.

03:06.576 --> 03:08.610
Turn off all those voices in your head.

03:08.612 --> 03:10.778
Said the woman claiming to be an angel.

03:10.780 --> 03:13.781
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait, stop.
Now, you can't tell anybody

03:13.783 --> 03:15.416
that I'm your guardian angel, okay?

03:15.418 --> 03:17.619
That would be very bad for me.

03:17.621 --> 03:18.920
Tons of paperwork.

03:18.922 --> 03:21.156
How 'bout we don't even
talk about the angel stuff?

03:21.158 --> 03:23.191
Because I don't believe you're an angel.

03:23.193 --> 03:24.559
As I was saying,

03:24.561 --> 03:27.295
go with that guy, not that guy.

03:27.297 --> 03:29.230
Grab the free sample, huh?

03:29.232 --> 03:32.233
Pet the doggy. Smell the baby.

03:32.235 --> 03:34.636
Mm. Whoa.

03:34.638 --> 03:36.237
That is not a clean baby.

03:36.239 --> 03:38.206
Ooh, test the Wet Paint sign.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.842
They're almost always wrong.

03:40.844 --> 03:43.011
Oh. That one was right.

03:50.854 --> 03:52.220
Hey, Dad.

03:52.222 --> 03:54.956
This is Amy. She needs to use the restroom.

03:54.958 --> 03:58.193
Bit of a white lie.
I just had to come up and meet Papa Bear.

03:59.329 --> 04:01.529
Marv! Oh!

04:01.531 --> 04:04.499
You're getting a face full of
the sisters now, aren't you?

04:04.501 --> 04:05.867
I'm sorry.

04:05.869 --> 04:07.769
Or should I say You're welcome?

04:07.771 --> 04:09.470
Sorry works.

04:09.472 --> 04:12.273
Well, congratulations on that one.
She's a masterpiece.

04:12.275 --> 04:13.308
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.310 --> 04:15.977
- Who are you?
- Amy. I'm Allison's new pal.

04:15.979 --> 04:17.678
Hey, anybody want to buy some oysters?

04:17.680 --> 04:18.713
Only a couple dozen left.

04:18.714 --> 04:20.048
Yeah, no, you can't

04:20.050 --> 04:21.416
sell seafood in the office.

04:21.418 --> 04:22.850
Oh, of course, yes.

04:22.852 --> 04:24.452
Beverly Hills, hmm?

04:26.690 --> 04:28.289
Allison, do you know

04:28.291 --> 04:30.892
how late you are?
That's a real question, by the way.

04:30.894 --> 04:33.828
- My watch stopped working again.
- I know, and I feel terrible.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.964
But I did text Nancy,
and she pushed my 2:00.

04:35.966 --> 04:39.033
Cool if I come backstage?

04:39.035 --> 04:41.803
And that area's no longer sanitary.

04:41.805 --> 04:43.805
Just call next time, okay?
'Cause you're never late

04:43.807 --> 04:44.772
and it's a little weird.

04:44.774 --> 04:46.274
Is he always like this?

04:46.276 --> 04:48.910
Shaking with worry like a little Chihuahua?

04:48.912 --> 04:50.111
What's happening?

04:50.113 --> 04:53.181
Your daughter is

04:53.183 --> 04:55.083
just... fine.

04:55.085 --> 04:58.519
And, now, if you'll kindly
direct me to your restroom,

04:58.521 --> 05:01.389
I'd like to take a little
birdbath in your sink.

05:01.391 --> 05:02.824
That way.

05:04.094 --> 05:05.927
When did you start palling around

05:05.929 --> 05:08.596
with an oyster peddler in a vest?

05:08.598 --> 05:10.531
She did help me find out
that Evan was cheating on me.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.133
I think she comes from a good place.

05:12.135 --> 05:15.303
She's going to the bathroom
with the door open.

05:15.305 --> 05:17.605
Oops! My bad!

05:17.607 --> 05:20.942
Forgot we were in Beverly Hills.

05:20.944 --> 05:22.810
Mmm.

05:23.212 --> 05:25.046
Hey.

05:25.048 --> 05:28.482
- What's going on?
- Thanks for coming by.

05:28.484 --> 05:30.084
Have a seat.

05:30.086 --> 05:32.753
Okay.

05:32.755 --> 05:34.422
How's your day so far?

05:34.424 --> 05:35.823
- Well, I...
- Listen, I got some rough news,

05:35.825 --> 05:37.124
and I want to tell you in person.

05:37.126 --> 05:38.859
I signed a lease on a new apartment.

05:38.861 --> 05:40.795
- I'm moving out.
- That's great.

05:40.797 --> 05:43.197
Yes. For me.
But things have been so brutal for you.

05:43.199 --> 05:45.599
With your boyfriend cheating on you.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.668
With your best friend. In your own house.

05:47.670 --> 05:50.705
I just know that you-you felt
safe with Big Bro Brad here.

05:50.707 --> 05:53.307
The only time I was scared
was the night you screamed

05:53.309 --> 05:54.875
when you saw a bat.

05:54.877 --> 05:56.377
I wasn't screaming.
I was scrambling its sonar.

05:56.379 --> 05:57.645
Bat.

05:57.647 --> 05:59.613
- Get the broom.
- Hello!

05:59.615 --> 06:01.348
Oh. Hey, there you are.

06:01.350 --> 06:02.750
Hey there, Allison. You know,

06:02.752 --> 06:04.552
I felt terrible about forgetting my wallet

06:04.554 --> 06:06.721
today at our lunch, so I wanted to come by,

06:06.723 --> 06:09.857
give you these flowers to say thank you.

06:09.859 --> 06:11.659
Aw. That's so thoughtful.

06:11.661 --> 06:16.530
Oh. Wow.
So, this is where the magic doesn't happen.

06:16.532 --> 06:19.200
- I get it.
- Not anymore. I'm moving out.

06:19.202 --> 06:21.435
Good for you. So, you're escaping the, uh,

06:21.437 --> 06:23.204
vortex of celibacy.

06:23.206 --> 06:24.538
That's enough.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.006
I don't take shots at where you live.

06:26.008 --> 06:28.309
Where do you live? Just south of here.

06:28.311 --> 06:29.844
Gorgeous doorman building,

06:29.846 --> 06:31.579
very hip,
full of beautiful people.

06:31.581 --> 06:33.647
Hey, you know what might
help the vibe in this place?

06:33.649 --> 06:35.883
One of those chairs
shaped like a giant hand.

06:35.885 --> 06:37.318
You know?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.220
And I think... yeah...

06:39.222 --> 06:42.056
it would just fit through.

06:42.058 --> 06:45.426
Ooh. Do we have a match on your dating app?

06:45.428 --> 06:47.328
Actually, yes. Yes, we do.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.329
Yeah!

06:48.331 --> 06:50.264
And this one looks interesting.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.333
He works downtown. He's a defense attorney.

06:52.335 --> 06:53.968
Sounds promising. Swipe right for yes.

06:53.970 --> 06:55.669
Though, hold the phone...

06:55.671 --> 06:58.038
- You are. he likes a late harvest Malbec.
- Mm.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.840
Could be a douche. No, I'm out.

06:59.842 --> 07:01.609
Swiping left. Though he loves reading.

07:01.611 --> 07:03.677
Mostly science fiction.

07:08.184 --> 07:10.851
Your sister just froze.
How do we reboot her?

07:10.853 --> 07:13.087
I got this.

07:13.089 --> 07:14.722
Dude, coaster.

07:14.724 --> 07:17.057
Wow. Well...

07:17.059 --> 07:21.228
what we have here is a
terminal case of overthinking.

07:21.230 --> 07:24.732
And the only cure?
A night of underthinking.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.634
You and I are going out tonight.

07:26.636 --> 07:29.003
I can't tonight.
No, I have cribbage with my dad.

07:29.005 --> 07:32.273
Oh, I love cribbage is
something no one has ever said.

07:32.275 --> 07:35.776
Go out with me to a little club called...

07:35.778 --> 07:37.745
Aura.

07:37.747 --> 07:39.747
Aura? Yeah, we can't get in there.

07:39.749 --> 07:42.149
I know the bouncer. Yes, we will.

07:42.151 --> 07:44.819
Allison, go with your gut.

07:44.821 --> 07:46.921
What do you say to an epic ladies'
night out?

07:46.923 --> 07:49.690
Do it. Do it. Do it. It'll help you
take your mind off me moving.

07:49.692 --> 07:51.725
- Oh, uh, yes! Yes.
- Yes!

07:51.727 --> 07:53.561
No, I can't bail on my dad.

07:53.563 --> 07:56.797
Uh, it's already happening.
Go for Marv.

07:59.001 --> 08:01.535
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, uh, Dad.

08:01.537 --> 08:04.505
I've got some bad news.
I'm gonna have to cancel tonight.

08:04.507 --> 08:06.640
- I...
- Go with your gut.

08:06.642 --> 08:08.776
I... It's my gut.

08:08.778 --> 08:13.113
- I have leaky gut. Yes.
- Wow, you're terrible at this.

08:13.115 --> 08:15.983
- That's 110% oyster-related.
- I know.

08:15.985 --> 08:18.352
They just looked so good.
Yeah, I had one out on the deck

08:18.354 --> 08:20.813
- by myself. Around 6:19.
- Wrap it up.

08:20.866 --> 08:23.591
Okay, Dad, I got to...
I got to go. I'll see you at the office.

08:24.369 --> 08:26.794
And so the night begins.

08:26.796 --> 08:29.330
All right, Allison,
what are you gonna wear out tonight?

08:29.332 --> 08:30.731
Don't think about it. Go.

08:30.733 --> 08:33.033
The red jumpsuit in the back of my closet.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.101
- Yes!
- No, I can't pull off

08:34.102 --> 08:35.669
- a jumpsuit.
- No one can.

08:35.671 --> 08:38.205
They're ridiculous.
They're like adult onesies.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.140
But the gut has spoken.

08:40.142 --> 08:43.910
Next, left-handed painkiller
or right-handed painkiller?

08:43.913 --> 08:45.913
- Neither.
- Suit yourself.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.551
Rock and roll!

08:50.553 --> 08:52.653
Okay. All right.

08:52.655 --> 08:53.821
Have my phone.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.104
Vodka or tequila? Go!

08:59.106 --> 09:01.406
Vodka!

09:02.910 --> 09:06.078
Oh!

09:06.080 --> 09:07.779
Dance floor! Okay!

09:08.749 --> 09:11.283
Yeah! Mm-hmm.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.954
All right, cowgirl,
we need to find you a man.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.689
What are you into?
Don't think about it. Go.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.026
Great ass! I'm an ass girl.
I had no idea.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.028
I'm on it. Now, do you want to
see a dating app in real life?

09:23.030 --> 09:26.364
You tell me, and I will swipe right or left

09:26.366 --> 09:29.467
for you, okay? Trust your gut.
Let's go!

09:30.103 --> 09:31.670
No.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.171
Nope.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.539
Hey!

09:35.676 --> 09:37.676
Whoa. Hi.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.277
I'm Allison.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.080
Hi. I'm Doug. Have we met?

09:42.082 --> 09:46.017
Oh, my God. You're the guy I got
matched with on my dating app.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.385
What a bizarre coincidence!

09:47.387 --> 09:49.788
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.223
This is 100% pure, uncut angel magic.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.892
Now, are we swiping this guy right?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.193
Trust your gut. What does it say?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.695
My gut's telling me to dance with him.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.297
Well, then that is step one.
Step two is to kiss him.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.800
Because you will not be
certain until you do, okay?

10:01.802 --> 10:05.537
Okay. Hey.

10:05.539 --> 10:08.006
Hey. There was no answer at your sister's.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.374
Uh, yeah, she went out with Amy.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.042
I knew she wasn't sick.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.410
She's a horrible liar.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.479
Yeah. She always uses the time 6:19.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.680
Everybody's got their tells.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.182
It's like you with the flop sweat.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.483
You going somewhere?

10:18.485 --> 10:19.751
Yeah, moving out.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.986
Got a new place.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.321
- Really?
- Yeah. It's incredible, Dad.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.223
Balcony, brand-new kitchen, rooftop access

10:25.225 --> 10:26.524
to, like, a pool and spa.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.759
Ah. Sounds expensive.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.728
I know. You think it would be.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.263
- But it's not.
- No?

10:32.265 --> 10:34.499
It's just you said things
were kind of slow at work.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.867
No, work's good.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.136
I, uh, I sold seven houses yesterday.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.138
- Brad...
- I messed up, Dad. I messed up.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.773
I don't know what happened.
Amy was telling me

10:41.775 --> 10:43.575
about going with my gut
and the next thing I know,

10:43.577 --> 10:45.377
I'm signing a two-year lease.
Six months down.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.078
Amy's behind this?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.613
Who is this woman?

10:48.615 --> 10:49.914
I tried to Google her.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.149
Nothing.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.384
Google knows everything.

10:52.386 --> 10:53.918
I tell you, it was so weird

10:53.920 --> 10:55.720
I called this cop friend of mine, huh?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.756
Asked him to do a background check.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.957
Maybe he's got something.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.893
- Hello?
- Jerry. Hey.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.895
Uh, anything on that Amy character?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.663
Oh, yeah.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.132
Turns out that woman's got quite a record.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.199
I knew it.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.467
They're all misdemeanors,

11:09.469 --> 11:10.702
and honestly I've never heard of

11:10.704 --> 11:11.970
most of these crimes before.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.571
Aggravated nudity.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.774
Impersonating a vehicle.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.575
Indecent shoplifting.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.010
That is a weird rap sheet.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.578
I did find her current residence...

11:20.580 --> 11:22.480
It's a halfway house over on Birchwood.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.549
She said she lived in a
beautiful doorman building.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.084
Anyway, I also found

11:26.086 --> 11:27.919
a video in her file.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.721
I just sent you the link.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.955
Great, we'll look at it now.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.223
What? You can't serve me?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.859
Why? I have a shirt and shoes on.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.328
Whoa, I just saw a rat back there.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.166
Oh, come on. Oh.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.803
Whoa.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.106
Okay, yeah.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.041
I'd have to call that indecent shoplifting.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.342
Thank you, Jerry.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.844
Thanks. Thanks very much.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.112
All right, I'm gonna...

11:54.114 --> 11:56.014
I'm gonna try not to freak out, here.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.515
It's... hey, Dad, it's...

11:57.517 --> 11:59.818
- ♪ It's all right ♪
- Yeah.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.021
- ♪ 'Cause it's all right ♪
- What are you doing?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.556
I'm singing the song that
Mom used to sing to you

12:04.558 --> 12:05.757
to relax you when you were being

12:05.759 --> 12:07.025
a little bit over-protective of us.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.793
♪ It's all right ♪

12:08.795 --> 12:10.195
I don't remember her doing it
with this much eye contact.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.696
♪ It's all right ♪

12:11.698 --> 12:14.866
♪ Have a good time... ♪

12:14.868 --> 12:19.003
Your daughter is just fine.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.040
Big Bird stole my watch.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.508
Allison is with a criminal.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.676
Where'd they go?

12:24.678 --> 12:26.611
- Aura...
- Stop that.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.679
No, it's Aura. It's a place called Aura.

12:27.681 --> 12:28.713
All right, come on, let's go.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.381
Okay.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.584
It's really good to be dancing.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.986
Last year,
I got in a pretty bad car accident.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.221
Oh, totally!

12:36.223 --> 12:38.623
What is up with the Kardashians?

12:38.625 --> 12:39.991
Sorry, if I could just, uh...

12:39.993 --> 12:41.793
My daughter, it's... I'm so sorry.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.128
Actually, let me take care of this, Dad.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.362
Okay. What's up...

12:44.364 --> 12:46.331
Kevin. How's the door tonight?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.999
I used to do a little road-housing

12:48.001 --> 12:49.434
back in college, so...

12:49.436 --> 12:51.936
So Pops is freaking out,

12:51.938 --> 12:53.471
His daughter's in there,

12:53.473 --> 12:55.140
he thinks she might be in
a little bit of trouble.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.774
I was hoping maybe we
could do a quick pop-in.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.576
Give it a little looky-loo?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.013
You're good.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.748
Appreciate the solid
from a fellow door dawg.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.016
No?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.484
Do you have change for a $50?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.786
Normally, I would tip $20... That's fine.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.729
Shuck it.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.431
Are you kidding me?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.200
Oh! Is this what you call

13:22.202 --> 13:23.701
going out for formula?

13:23.703 --> 13:25.703
It's... not what it looks like?

13:25.705 --> 13:28.573
Oh, my God. You're married?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.175
All right,
this is all just a big misunderstanding.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.709
Okay? Uh, no harm, no foul.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.044
She just kissed my husband!

13:33.046 --> 13:34.379
Well, we all make mistakes.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.680
You brought a baby into a nightclub, so...

13:35.682 --> 13:38.116
I am so, so sorry about all of this.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.121
Allison!

13:43.123 --> 13:44.389
Kev, we got a fight on the floor!

13:44.391 --> 13:46.624
Hey, that baby just took my choker.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.259
Uh... that's it.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.460
You've had your fun, baby.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.496
Now hand over the choker,

13:51.498 --> 13:53.131
or I'm gonna make you
wish you were never Bjorn.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.969
Rule number one for bouncers...

13:57.971 --> 14:00.071
you want to use humor to defuse a crisis.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.740
- Let's go.
- I did get the formula, it's in the...

14:02.742 --> 14:05.310
What the hell did you get me into, Amy?

14:10.415 --> 14:11.681
Okay, what are you two even doing here?

14:11.683 --> 14:13.183
Just thought you might want to know

14:13.185 --> 14:15.540
your friend here, the Jolly Blonde Giant,

14:15.593 --> 14:16.622
has a criminal record.

14:16.649 --> 14:17.554
Oh, tiny stuff.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.761
And most of it was when I
was young and in my 40s.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.119
Tell how you stole my watch.

14:22.172 --> 14:24.138
I did not steal your watch.

14:24.229 --> 14:26.162
And how you drunkenly Pooh-Beared it all up

14:26.164 --> 14:27.730
inside of a donut shop.

14:27.732 --> 14:30.032
I did not steal your watch.

14:30.034 --> 14:31.400
Why don't you tell us about

14:31.402 --> 14:32.802
how you lied to us about where you live.

14:32.804 --> 14:34.237
All right, what the hell is going on?

14:34.239 --> 14:36.272
Allison, come on. You know me.

14:36.274 --> 14:38.007
I know you said you were my friend.

14:38.009 --> 14:39.342
But my friends don't lie to me.

14:39.344 --> 14:40.843
Okay, honey, I want you to trust me,

14:40.845 --> 14:42.812
so why don't we all go over to my place?

14:42.814 --> 14:44.881
You can see where I live,
learn all about me.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.548
I have no secrets.

14:46.666 --> 14:48.084
Give me another chance, okay?

14:48.086 --> 14:49.986
Okay.

14:49.988 --> 14:51.287
Last chance.

14:51.289 --> 14:52.755
- Let's go.
- Okay.

14:52.757 --> 14:54.657
We gonna get all cozy and fit in one car?

14:54.659 --> 14:55.925
Santa's got some room right here,

14:55.927 --> 14:57.193
if you've been a good girl.

14:57.195 --> 14:59.395
I can't stop.

15:00.296 --> 15:02.165
All right, this is it.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.399
This is where I live.

15:03.401 --> 15:04.801
It's a supervised facility

15:04.803 --> 15:06.502
for people getting back on their feet.

15:06.504 --> 15:08.871
I'm a live-in counselor here.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.010
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.074
So are you a counselor
here or are you a resident?

15:12.076 --> 15:13.509
I am a counselor,

15:13.511 --> 15:14.810
Allison,

15:14.812 --> 15:16.111
in residence.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.447
So this is the doorman building?

15:18.449 --> 15:21.217
You may see a halfway house
with a security staff,

15:21.219 --> 15:24.086
but what I see is a grand doorman building.

15:24.088 --> 15:25.988
And the people here are beautiful.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.256
That's a great story.

15:27.258 --> 15:29.458
Counterpoint...

15:29.460 --> 15:30.893
here's my stolen watch.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.628
Case closed. Saddle up.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.029
Marv... listen.

15:34.031 --> 15:36.098
I felt bad that things
between the two of us

15:36.100 --> 15:37.533
got off on the wrong foot,

15:37.535 --> 15:39.602
so I had your watch fixed.

15:39.604 --> 15:40.970
Check it out.

15:40.972 --> 15:42.738
I was going to leave it
at your office tomorrow.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.039
Yeah.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.542
Ah. This must be your doorman,

15:46.544 --> 15:48.010
completing the Park Avenue vibe.

15:48.012 --> 15:50.145
No visitors after 10:00 p.m.

15:50.147 --> 15:51.947
I'm marking you down for this one, Amy.

15:51.949 --> 15:53.349
- Oh...
- We were just leaving.

15:53.351 --> 15:55.784
- Allison...
- Good night, Amy.

15:57.989 --> 16:00.222
Et tu, Hot Pockets?

16:00.224 --> 16:02.160
We're not doing that anymore.

16:02.279 --> 16:03.466
No?

16:10.968 --> 16:13.135
I am sorry you're stuck
with this new apartment.

16:13.137 --> 16:14.570
I'm good.

16:16.707 --> 16:19.008
Brad...

16:19.010 --> 16:20.909
this place is incredible!

16:20.911 --> 16:23.045
I know. It's expensive.

16:23.047 --> 16:24.513
Hey, you guys moving in?

16:24.515 --> 16:25.748
Yes!

16:25.750 --> 16:27.182
Just me, though.

16:27.184 --> 16:28.651
Not her. Who is my sister.

16:28.653 --> 16:30.052
We aren't dating.

16:30.054 --> 16:31.987
No. Ever. Never were dating.

16:31.989 --> 16:33.522
I'm Brad. Single Brad.

16:33.524 --> 16:35.624
Hey, Single Brad. I'm Katie.

16:35.626 --> 16:38.294
It'll be so nice to finally
have a man on this floor.

16:38.296 --> 16:40.462
This place is, like, all girls.

16:40.464 --> 16:42.264
I used to be a bouncer.

16:42.266 --> 16:43.599
That's great.

16:43.601 --> 16:45.367
See you around.

16:46.570 --> 16:47.903
Amy is a genius.

16:47.905 --> 16:49.171
Oh, really?

16:49.173 --> 16:50.839
Because one cute girl lives here?

16:50.841 --> 16:53.275
No, no, no. I really think
our lives are getting better.

16:53.277 --> 16:54.643
Yours, yeah.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.278
I mean, you have this brand-new apartment.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.547
It's great. But how is Amy good for me?

16:58.549 --> 17:00.316
You got out of the house last night.

17:00.318 --> 17:01.550
You had an amazing time.

17:01.552 --> 17:02.885
Before you kissed a married man.

17:02.887 --> 17:04.319
Who had a wife. Who had a baby.

17:04.321 --> 17:05.921
That kiss was disgusting, by the way.

17:05.923 --> 17:07.388
It was weird.

17:07.391 --> 17:09.657
It was like it felt wrong
the second I did it.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.361
Exactly.
Now you know that guy's not right for you.

17:12.363 --> 17:14.089
Yeah.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.232
Yeah, I guess would have stared

17:17.233 --> 17:18.901
at that guy's profile for a whole week,

17:18.903 --> 17:21.203
not knowing he was a married dirtbag.

17:21.204 --> 17:22.671
Amy.

17:22.673 --> 17:24.173
Good God, I want this whole building

17:24.175 --> 17:25.674
to move in slow motion.

17:25.675 --> 17:27.409
- Oh, Dad, gross, you're... Dad.
- I know, right?

17:27.411 --> 17:28.711
You can thank Amy, by the way.

17:28.713 --> 17:29.978
She turned me onto this place.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.747
Let's not speak of the giant.

17:31.749 --> 17:32.881
I will say, however,

17:32.883 --> 17:34.249
it appears she fixed my watch.

17:34.251 --> 17:35.918
She did fix it?

17:43.160 --> 17:44.626
- Hey.
- Hey!

17:44.628 --> 17:46.929
She's back! Come on in.

17:46.931 --> 17:48.964
What's going on? Are you moving?

17:48.966 --> 17:50.132
Yeah, seems like the next

17:50.134 --> 17:51.834
logical step after being kicked out.

17:51.836 --> 17:54.069
Apparently, having guests after hours

17:54.071 --> 17:55.604
brought on a lot of scrutiny,

17:55.606 --> 17:57.539
even for counselors, so...

17:57.541 --> 17:59.908
I can't believe we got you kicked out.
I'm sorry.

17:59.910 --> 18:02.311
I should have told you that
I lived at a halfway house,

18:02.313 --> 18:03.879
but I've asked your little human brain

18:03.881 --> 18:06.415
to process so much in the last few weeks,

18:06.417 --> 18:08.183
I didn't think you could handle it all.

18:08.185 --> 18:10.085
My little human brain?

18:10.087 --> 18:12.087
Yeah,
as opposed to the angel super computer

18:12.089 --> 18:14.022
I got goin' on right up here.

18:14.024 --> 18:15.357
You were right.

18:15.359 --> 18:17.259
I've been a little stuck

18:17.261 --> 18:19.528
and, uh, it felt really nice

18:19.530 --> 18:21.130
to make some decisions.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.032
But then, you know,

18:24.034 --> 18:26.101
you start talking about being an angel

18:26.103 --> 18:29.438
and how you have this-this
computer inside your head

18:29.440 --> 18:33.108
and I'm just like,
what the hell am I doing with this woman?

18:33.110 --> 18:34.710
So...

18:34.712 --> 18:36.512
I am just going to ask you...

18:36.514 --> 18:38.180
are you crazy?

18:38.182 --> 18:39.648
Does it matter?

18:39.650 --> 18:41.650
Yes!

18:42.586 --> 18:45.154
- Hey!
- Hey, sister.

18:45.156 --> 18:46.922
Aw...

18:46.924 --> 18:48.690
- I heard you're leaving.
- Yes, I am.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.193
- Are you bucking for my mini-fridge?
- No.

18:51.195 --> 18:53.796
- I just wanted to say thank you.
- Oh...

18:53.798 --> 18:55.164
This woman is a godsend.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.498
Aw, I'm really happy for you.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.933
- Call me anytime, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

18:57.935 --> 18:59.401
My phone is always on. Okay.

18:59.403 --> 19:01.537
Mute. So leave a message.

19:03.641 --> 19:05.140
Aw.

19:05.142 --> 19:06.742
Nice girl. Lots of problems.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.243
Nose candy.

19:08.245 --> 19:11.013
Ah... shuck it.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.383
This is probably nuts,

19:14.385 --> 19:16.485
but, uh, hanging out with you,

19:16.487 --> 19:19.254
strangely, seems to be good for me.

19:19.256 --> 19:20.823
Brad's moving out of the garage,

19:20.825 --> 19:24.026
so do you want to crash there for a while?

19:24.028 --> 19:26.862
Allison, wow.

19:26.864 --> 19:28.931
I would love to.

19:28.933 --> 19:31.066
But are you sure?
Have you thought about this?

19:31.068 --> 19:33.869
- Not at all.
- That's my girl. Up top.

19:36.674 --> 19:38.207
- Why are you clapping?
- I don't know.

19:38.209 --> 19:40.442
Going with my gut. Feels good.

19:44.929 --> 19:46.162
I don't think it's going to fit.

19:46.164 --> 19:48.364
Oh, it'll fit. Right there.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.367
Your new tenant has a box

19:51.369 --> 19:53.336
labeled Loose Bones...?

19:53.338 --> 19:54.937
That's for a project, Marv.

19:54.939 --> 19:57.540
Oh,
thanks for being here on time this morning.

19:59.444 --> 20:01.577
I don't think her moving in is a good idea.

20:01.579 --> 20:04.480
Dad, I know you've been worried
about me since the breakup,

20:04.482 --> 20:06.349
and I appreciate that,

20:06.351 --> 20:07.783
but I'm going to be okay.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.418
LAPD has a photograph of her

20:09.420 --> 20:12.021
riding her bicycle on
the Santa Monica freeway.

20:12.576 --> 20:13.723
In the carpool lane.

Oyster King of L.A. is coming over

20:43.755 --> 20:45.187
and this little garage

20:45.189 --> 20:46.927
ain't gonna know what hit it!

20:47.046 --> 20:50.318
These windows are double paint, right?
Cause the King is a screamer.
