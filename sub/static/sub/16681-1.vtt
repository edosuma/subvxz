03:10.148 --> 03:13.693
Try to do it. I'm gonna be breathing,
with an "F."

03:13.776 --> 03:17.238

03:17.322 --> 03:19.949
-Oh, my "bref."

Look at this, man.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.114
It's good.

04:00.198 --> 04:04.118
I was joking about getting in shape,
but that shit is real. You gotta do that.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.996
That's the latest thing.
Everybody gotta lose weight.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.917
I got all the equipment at my house.
I don't do none of it.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.212
I got everything you can order
on the infomercial.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.548
I got so much equipment,
my neighbors come and work out.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.969
I got my own-- sell my own
gym membership. "Y'all come in.

04:21.052 --> 04:25.014
There's some towels, cucumber water.
Go on, enjoy yourself, John.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.227
I ain't using none of that shit.
Go on in."

04:30.228 --> 04:32.730
Gotta try to do it. I had to do something.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.150
I'm walking down the street.
This lady sees me, a little white lady.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.903
She got a little daughter.
She sees me. "Oh, my God.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.949
I can't believe it's you.
Can we take a picture?" "Of course!"

04:43.032 --> 04:45.326
She talking about,
"Thank you, CeeLo!"

05:03.553 --> 05:05.596
Shit.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.686
I walked right into a cycling class,
nigga.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.944
[chuckles] Shit, man.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.864
I gotta do something.
Everybody losin' weight in Hollywood.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.200
All my partners. Ain't nobody call me
and tell me nothing.

05:26.284 --> 05:30.288
I'm like the last fat brother
in Hollywood.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.458
Anthony Anderson lost weight.
He ain't called me to tell me.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.793
Rick Ross lost weight.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.837
The Boss, he's-- [grunts forcefully]

05:37.920 --> 05:40.256
He all skinny as hell, like, "Eh."

05:43.009 --> 05:46.345
Al Roker, Al Sharpton.

05:46.429 --> 05:50.141
You know, Al Sharpton lost too much
goddamn weight though.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.310
Al Sharpton lost neck weight.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.731
His head look like a damn bobblehead.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.738
Like Al, you can't lose neck weight.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.866
You can't have no perm
and no little-ass neck like that.

06:08.367 --> 06:11.954
That combination don't go together, Al,
is what I'm trying to say.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.209
Come out here feeling good, man.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.127
Lookin' good. Everybody all spiffy.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.712
-[woman] Whoo!
-I like that.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.131
I like to get G'd up. We from that--

06:22.215 --> 06:24.801
-We from that generation.
-[Audience] Yeah!

06:24.884 --> 06:27.095
I notice how the new kids
are dressing.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.598
They ain't really give
a shit about clothes no more.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.309
They don't really give a shit.
Especially boys.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.354
The thing is, I ain't trying to say
they style is--

06:36.437 --> 06:41.359
It's for their generation, don't get me
wrong, but it's a little asexual.

06:41.442 --> 06:45.113
All the little long-ass T-shirts
niggas is wearing now.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.908
One little boy, his shirt was so long,
he had a train on the back.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.621
I'm like, "Where's the reception,
motherfucker? Shit."

06:57.875 --> 07:00.253
I think it started with skinny jeans.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.505
-[audience agreeing]
-You know what I mean.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.924
The jegging kind,
the real super-skinny ones.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.261
I ain't trying to say skinny jeans gay.
I don't know that to be true.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.638
What I'm sayin' is,
it's a gateway apparel.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.598
[audience laughing]

07:12.682 --> 07:16.436
It leads to other gay articles
of clothing is what I'm saying.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.898
'Cause there ain't no time should a dude
ever be putting their jeans on like this.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.820
Never!

07:26.446 --> 07:27.947
Ever.

07:31.534 --> 07:35.997
Sagging. That shit went too far.
I used to get sagging.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.999
When it first came out, I understood it,

07:38.082 --> 07:42.462
because that's when new
designer underwear came on the scene.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.923
So you want to let somebody know
that he Tommy Hilfiger, that he Gucci.

07:46.007 --> 07:50.052
"Look, these ain't no regular
Fruit of the Looms is what I got on."

07:50.136 --> 07:51.637
I got that.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.808
Now these dudes got they pants
all up under they ass and shit.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.311
I saw one little boy,
didn't have his pants on.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.063
That nigga had his shit on his shoulders.

08:03.691 --> 08:09.030
"It's that new, Ced.
We don't even wear our shit no more, man.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.658
We just carry it with us in case
we gotta run in somewhere, man."

08:17.079 --> 08:18.581
It's a trip, man.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.083
They music has changed too, boy.
That young music.

08:21.167 --> 08:25.129
I like rap, all kinds of rap,
but rap got so aggressive now, man.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.591
Like when we came up,
it used to be sexual innuendo.

08:28.674 --> 08:32.803
They might be talkin' about something.
You had to figure it out. "Oh, okay."

08:32.886 --> 08:36.097
Y'all heard "Down in the DM"?
They ain't got time for that shit.

08:36.182 --> 08:40.895
♪ It go down in the DM, it go down
It go down in the DM, it go down ♪

08:40.977 --> 08:42.480
♪ Snapchat me that pussy ♪

08:42.563 --> 08:45.608
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

08:45.691 --> 08:47.902
Ooh, Jesus.

08:47.985 --> 08:51.113
♪ Or FaceTime me that pussy if it's cool ♪

08:54.951 --> 08:57.119
What did they--

08:57.203 --> 09:00.581
On the record?
That's on the radio right now.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.334
When I first heard it,
I ain't know what Snapchat was.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.962
I thought he said,
"Snatch at me that pussy."

09:06.045 --> 09:08.214
I said that is pretty aggressive

09:08.297 --> 09:11.050
with all this Bill Cosby stuff
goin' on right now.

09:11.759 --> 09:15.638
I don't think you wanna be snatching
at nobody's pussy like that now."

09:15.721 --> 09:18.849
They were like, "No, Ced, it's Snapchat.
It's Snapchat."

09:18.933 --> 09:21.435
That's an app.
I don't know if y'all know this.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.522
That's a little app.
It's what all the kids on right now.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.358
And you can take a picture
of your pussy, now, okay?

09:28.317 --> 09:32.405
And you can put it up on the Internet,
and it will disappear like a snowflake.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.240
Okay? It will be gone.

09:34.323 --> 09:37.618
So whenever you bored and you just
feel like doin' something--

09:37.702 --> 09:39.829
Snapchat your pussy on out there!

09:40.788 --> 09:42.748
Snapchat your pussy. All the way.

09:43.499 --> 09:47.003
It's fine. I ain't know what it was.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.756
Soon as I heard you can do that shit,
I downloaded that app immediately.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.845
I would be ridin' around in my car,
lookin' at the app now and then.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.806
Ain't nobody Snapchat on mine.
I ain't got no--

09:58.889 --> 10:02.685
I don't know how this work.
Don't nobody put none on mine.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.106
"Snapchat me that pussy."

10:08.983 --> 10:11.277
All they little songs. I like all rap.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.363
Fetty Wap. That's another rapper
had a big hit. Fetty Wap.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.367
Big rapper. Y'all know Fetty Wap.
That's the rapper with one eye.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.579
Fetty Wap had a little accident
earlier in the year

10:21.704 --> 10:23.581
where he was on a motorcycle.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.667
And I was thinkin' to myself,
"You know what, Fetty Wap?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.879
-Uh--"
-[audience laughing]

10:29.962 --> 10:32.256
"Your head got one eye.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.842
You might not wanna be on
no goddamn motorcycle.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.139
You gotta have your peripheral
when you on a goddamn motorcycle.

10:40.222 --> 10:45.436
You can't turn all way left, nigga,
every time you tryin' to turn.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.731
Stay off goddamn motorcycles, okay?
With love."

10:51.817 --> 10:56.322
But he dope though. I like him
'cause he got a melodic kind of rap style.

10:56.405 --> 11:00.993
It's got melody to it, but out of nowhere,
it'll turn into some gangsta shit.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.789
So it be a love song,
and then out of nowhere, it be a tragedy.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.833
So it like a Fetty Wapera, if you will.

11:07.917 --> 11:12.797
Fetty Wap be like,
♪ Baby, won't you come my way ♪

11:12.880 --> 11:17.176
♪ Tell me what you want to say ♪

11:17.259 --> 11:18.427
♪ But first off ♪

11:18.511 --> 11:21.097
♪ I'm gonna start by saying this: Ay ♪

11:21.180 --> 11:24.975
♪ Two head shots
if you try to take my bitch ♪

11:25.059 --> 11:27.019
Like, whoa!

11:27.103 --> 11:30.231
Whoa, what just happened there? You know.

11:30.314 --> 11:34.026
That is mighty aggressive, Fetty Wap.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.278
I just saying
she looked nice in her dress.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.533
I don't think I deserve two shots
in the damn head for that, you know.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.620
I don't think the crime
fits the punishment.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.625
Even the girls are aggressive.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.045
I heard the most aggressive language
I've heard in a record this year came

11:53.170 --> 11:57.174
from a little girl. I'm riding
in the car with my 12-year-old daughter.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.759
She's singing along.

11:58.843 --> 12:03.055
All of a sudden, this girl say the most
craziest shit I ever heard in a song.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.476
She like,  ♪ You gotta eat
the booty like groceries ♪  Now wait.

12:08.602 --> 12:12.940
What? Ooh, Lord,
where's Yolanda Adams when you need her?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.862
"You gotta eat the booty like groceries"?

12:19.864 --> 12:23.242
Don't get me wrong, I'm over 40,
so I'm willing to participate

12:23.325 --> 12:24.660
is what I'm saying--

12:25.703 --> 12:29.623
I just need to know how much groceries
we talkin' about right now.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.918
Is it ten items or less or--

12:33.002 --> 12:36.464
Or are we talking Costco's,
now, 'cause I think--

12:36.547 --> 12:38.966
Somebody yell up here,
"Come on, help me with the groceries!"

12:39.049 --> 12:41.760
That's too much goddamn groceries.
I can't--

12:41.844 --> 12:44.305
I can't eat that much groceries.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.683
All these little songs, man.

12:48.559 --> 12:52.354
They got songs that be making dudes--
gotta get your manhood together.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.358
Like Rihanna little song. I turn that off
every time it come on. I can't listen.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.154
'Cause it make you do some bullshit.
You a grown man. You came here.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.831
Unh-unh.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.960
Rihanna always got songs like that.
She always tripping.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.214
'Cause her other song last year
was a scary song to me.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.299

you taught them,

21:13.855 --> 21:15.691

to my son's school,

21:18.860 --> 21:22.322

was up there cussing.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.473
They say, "Yeah." I say, "Oh, no.

21:48.557 --> 21:53.186

are influencing my son, you know.

or 'Fuck that shit, dawg'

Or something like that,
I would have taken responsibility.

is not a part of our culture, okay?

26:07.983 --> 26:09.818
go on ahead, have a damn baby.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.988
I just find it rude and inconsiderate,
personally.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.992
You gotta think about this. You 55.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.412
That means she already
got kids that got kids.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.247
When they go visit grandmama,

26:22.330 --> 26:24.582
they gotta deal with
their little aunt or uncle.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.970
You gotta be thinkin' about it.
That gotta be fucked up. You eight, nine.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.681
You go to your grandmama's house
to go play--

26:39.764 --> 26:43.435
Here come this little motherfucker,
"Hey, unh-unh, whoa, whoa!

26:43.560 --> 26:45.687
Where you think you goin'?

26:45.770 --> 26:48.440
No, pick me up, take me upstairs
and change my diaper.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.776
Then you can go outside. I'm sorry, what?

26:51.860 --> 26:55.238
I'm your little uncle,
that's who I am, goddamn it, shit.

26:55.822 --> 26:58.450
Put that on Disney Channel,
put something in my sippy cup,

26:58.533 --> 27:01.828
then you can go outside,
but other than that-- come again?

27:01.911 --> 27:05.290
I'm your little uncle,
that's who I am, motherfucker.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.460
Your mama's my sister.
Respect the hierarchy around here, shit.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.422
Don't give a damn how old I am."

27:12.505 --> 27:15.091
Fucking little-ass uncle.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.469
What a trip, man.

27:17.552 --> 27:20.930
Saw this shit too. I saw Lamar Odom--
God bless Lamar Odom.

27:21.014 --> 27:24.934
I'm glad I saw him. He doin' a'ight,
but that was a little scary.

27:25.018 --> 27:29.105
The scary thing-- it let me know
I'd been out the game for a long time.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.817
Scary thing, I was glad he was all right,
but when shit hit the news,

27:32.901 --> 27:36.029
told me he had spent $75,000
for two chicks,

27:36.112 --> 27:38.073
I was like, "Ooh! When I was--

27:38.156 --> 27:43.787
I kinda-- I kinda been out of the game
for a while.

27:43.870 --> 27:47.332
This nigga seemed to raise the Blue Book
on these bitches right here.

27:47.415 --> 27:49.000
Nigga, that's--

27:50.085 --> 27:51.503
That's--

27:52.712 --> 27:55.215
That's pretty expensive."

27:56.925 --> 28:00.595
As soon as he did that, at your local
strip club, all the girls went up.

28:00.678 --> 28:03.473
They heard them girls got 35,000 a piece.

28:03.556 --> 28:06.101
They was like, "Unh-unh, table dances--

28:06.184 --> 28:08.978
Table dances is $80, Latrell."

28:11.981 --> 28:13.608
[audience laughing]

28:13.691 --> 28:16.027
That my black stripper dance right here.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.113
[audience laughing]

28:20.573 --> 28:24.035
[audience laughing continues]

28:24.119 --> 28:28.039
You be, "Hey, baby, let me get a piece
of gum." "I ain't chewing no gum."

28:31.543 --> 28:34.546
"Wait. You not chewing gum right now?"
"No, motherfucker--

28:35.380 --> 28:37.632
This how you do the dance, nigga."

28:43.179 --> 28:45.682
"So you sayin' you not chewing gum
right now."

28:46.266 --> 28:49.018
"No, motherfucker, I'm in my job.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.439
Do you chew gum at your job?"

28:54.774 --> 28:56.526
[audience laughing]

28:56.609 --> 29:00.196
All I know is that shit make me want
some gum like a motherfucker.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.451
[chuckles]

29:04.534 --> 29:06.286
That's the difference too.

29:06.369 --> 29:09.539
'Cause you go down South,
they got that shake-a-booty style.

29:09.622 --> 29:12.792
I live in LA. They got
the more corporate strip club--

29:12.876 --> 29:14.919
It's all about the up-top game.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.714
There, the girl's like,
"Oh, my God, how are you?

29:19.799 --> 29:23.303
Yeah. Yeah.

29:23.386 --> 29:27.223
Yeah, you like that? You like that?"

29:27.307 --> 29:29.684
"Uh, no, not really, baby."

29:31.853 --> 29:35.190
Brothers, we be wanting
that goddamn bass, nigga.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.610
You go there, you be seeing--
You come down here--

29:38.693 --> 29:40.945
I went to Atlanta one time, saw a girl--

29:41.029 --> 29:45.325
Her ass was so fat, I thought I had on
3-D glasses, nigga. I was, "Ooh!

29:45.867 --> 29:48.328
Ooh, I gotta take these off!
That's too close.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.081
Ooh, that's givin' me a headache.
Is that too close for you?"

29:52.165 --> 29:55.043
I can't wear these.
I can't wear these and look at her.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.881
'Cause they got that shake-a-booty style.
That style right there.

30:02.717 --> 30:06.095
You ever notice, once you a stripper
and do the shake-a-booty style,

30:06.179 --> 30:07.680
you can't stop doing it.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.558
Anybody know somebody that
used to strip and don't no more?

30:10.642 --> 30:13.269
They'll just do this shit
in regular life sometimes.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.399
They be at the bank
about to cash their check.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.154
You be behind them with your check like--

30:24.739 --> 30:28.952
"You know what, give me that
in all ones, my nigga, a'ight?

30:29.035 --> 30:33.540
I didn't know y'all was doing it
like that up in here today."

30:36.084 --> 30:38.211
They're doing it big.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.881
No, it's a condition.
They don't know they doing it.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.467
It's something like stripper Tourette's.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.719
The stripper Tourette's.
You don't know you're doing it.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.472
You don't strip no more.
You have moved on in life.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.767
You got your real estate license
and everything, you know.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.186
[mumbles]

30:55.270 --> 30:57.689
But don't let your song happen to come on.

30:57.772 --> 31:00.149
It's just a-- You can't help it.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.443
Even in your mind you might hear your song

31:02.527 --> 31:03.820
and just do stripper shit.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.281
They be about to check out

39:16.145 --> 39:18.731
seeing your one girl cousin
that dress like a boy,

39:18.814 --> 39:21.442
but she show up
at the family reunion pregnant.

39:23.444 --> 39:26.280
Everybody like, "Who the fuck
is fucking Mr. Cynthia?"

39:29.575 --> 39:32.370
I can't figure it out. Who?

39:34.038 --> 39:37.833
I think Hillary want to win
just so she can get Bill back.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.045
She going to be in the Oval Office
with somebody under her desk,

39:41.128 --> 39:43.422
nigga, like,

39:43.506 --> 39:45.925
"I'm the captain now!

39:47.134 --> 39:50.888
Look at me. I'm the captain now."

39:54.016 --> 39:56.227
Everybody think they can do
what Barack did, man.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.938
They gonna come in
and just try to do their job.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.564
Barack did his thing, man.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.150
-[cheering]
-Barack did his thing, man.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.863
As the president,
if they keep fucking with him,

40:07.947 --> 40:11.325
I don't know if he gonna make it
all the way to the end.

40:11.409 --> 40:15.413
Barack might quit like that black lady
did on the news. Remember?

40:15.496 --> 40:20.251
Wake up one day, go, "Fuck this shit!
I ain't going through this shit."

40:20.334 --> 40:24.338
Just leave. I know he ain't gonna
put on no suit that last day.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.757
That last day,
Barack ain't gonna put on no suit.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.427
He gonna walk to that helicopter
in Jordan flip-flops

40:29.510 --> 40:34.390
with his hat backwards,
wave cap on, nigga.

40:34.473 --> 40:37.268
"Michelle, Sasha, Malia, y'all coming?

40:38.018 --> 40:41.564
Oh, get some of those sheets.
I like that thread count on that shit."

40:43.774 --> 40:46.902
I don't know why they be messing
with that man like that, man.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.281
Barack, he the only one who really
could have been the first black president.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.492
For real. Look around. I mean,
look at yourselves. Come on, now.

40:54.535 --> 40:57.621
We like to fight too much.
Everybody in this room be like--

40:57.705 --> 41:00.458
We can't have nobody say shit about us.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.209
Barack be holding that shit in.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.629
Every now and then,
that negro do show up though.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.048
Black people see it.
We see it first.

41:08.132 --> 41:11.135
We like,
"Ooh, there it is. He about to trip."

41:15.514 --> 41:19.935
Not long ago, he was talking about
I've done all I can do with this and that.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.604
"Right, 'cause you can't go again!"

41:21.687 --> 41:25.399
Barack was like, "Because
I won 'em all, fuck, boy, pussy."

41:28.110 --> 41:30.654
You got to listen to the tape slow.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.156
You got to play it real slow.

Just saying."

41:37.953 --> 41:40.873

44:27.539 --> 44:30.167
And them mothers will fight your ass too.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.710
That's the thing about it.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.962
Black people, we think
just 'cause we born black

44:34.046 --> 44:35.547
we can beat up white dudes.

44:35.631 --> 44:38.676
In our minds, we like, "White boy,
I'll beat your motherfucking ass.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.095
You better go on with that bullshit, boy."

44:41.178 --> 44:43.972
You don't do that shit
in the country, man.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.434
Trying to tell you that shit ain't
gonna go like you think at all.

"Come on, son of a bitch!

Fuck.

45:10.624 --> 45:14.044
I ain't trying to get Bobby Boucher
down this bitch.

45:17.089 --> 45:19.091
It's totally different than black country.

45:19.174 --> 45:22.052
Black country is a whole 'nother
dialogue altogether.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.637
I got some country-ass cousins--

45:23.720 --> 45:26.682
It's fast and it's country
and it all ran together.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.892
You don't know what the fuck
they be saying.

45:28.976 --> 45:32.688
I got a cousin excited to see me.
Every time he see me, "Hey, coz.

45:32.771 --> 45:35.607
Hey-- [rapid babbling]."

45:36.442 --> 45:37.901
"Huh?"

45:37.985 --> 45:40.446
"Hey-- [rapid babbling]."

45:44.283 --> 45:47.411
[rapid babbling continues]

45:47.494 --> 45:50.247
"Hey-- [rapid babbling]."

45:50.330 --> 45:54.293
"Why you like-- [rapid babbling].

45:57.171 --> 45:58.630
"What?

46:01.091 --> 46:05.179
I'm gonna need closed captions
for your ass, nigga. I don't have--

46:05.262 --> 46:07.973
I have no idea what you just said,
motherfucker."

46:09.057 --> 46:12.853
Trip is, I'm talking to one of my cousin's
friends, he talk faster than him.

46:12.936 --> 46:14.521
He walk up and introduce himself.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.316
"Charles Johnson. Everybody
around here call me 'Bominicious.'

46:17.399 --> 46:19.443
Everybody around here call me
Bominicious. It's fine.

46:19.526 --> 46:22.863
You call me that. Don't even worry
about it. Everybody call me Bominicious."

46:22.946 --> 46:25.032
"Everybody call you 'Bominicious'"?

46:25.699 --> 46:28.535
"Yeah, everybody in the whole city
call me Bominicious. Don't worry.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.787
You can call me that.
Don't worry about it."

46:30.871 --> 46:32.331
"That's what everybody calls you?"

46:32.414 --> 46:34.249
"Yeah, everybody calls me that."

46:34.333 --> 46:37.169
So I'm like, "All right."
So all week long...

46:37.252 --> 46:40.297
my ass talking about,
"Bominicious, what up, boy?"

46:40.380 --> 46:44.301
"Hey, Bominicious, you gonna come
over here watch the game with us?"

46:44.384 --> 46:47.304
"Hey, Bominicious, run to the store,
grab some beer, come on back."

46:47.387 --> 46:49.431
My coz said, "What'd you call him?"

46:59.316 --> 47:01.318
"Bominicious.

47:01.401 --> 47:05.155
He said everybody called him Bominicious.
It's all right for me to call him that."

47:05.239 --> 47:07.407
"No, man, his name is C.J."

47:08.659 --> 47:13.163
He saying, "You can call me
by my initials." That's what he saying.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.220
C.J.

47:28.303 --> 47:31.515
I been calling that boy
Bominicious all week.

47:31.598 --> 47:35.060
"By my initials," is what he's saying.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.149
This shit is embarrassing.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.487
"Why you ain't say nothing?
You heard me call you Bominicious."

47:47.072 --> 47:49.908
"I couldn't understand you.
I ain't know what you talking about."

47:50.576 --> 47:54.830
"You couldn't understand me?
Okay. All right. All right.

47:55.706 --> 47:58.959
Okay. I deserve that."

47:59.042 --> 48:02.296
We had a little wild-ass year.
We had a wild-ass year.

The world is angry as hell,
for good reason.

49:42.854 --> 49:44.773
Lot of bullshit going on out there.

49:44.856 --> 49:47.943
Like all this year, all the violence
where police were killing kids.

49:48.026 --> 49:49.486
I got a little boy, man.

49:49.569 --> 49:51.488
I'm concerned about this shit.

49:51.571 --> 49:55.117
Like police will just shoot
a little black kid.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.495
Same motherfucker will jump
in a raging river to save a dog.

49:58.578 --> 50:01.289
That's why every time my boy
leave the house, I'm like,

50:01.373 --> 50:03.792
"Take the puppy with you, nigga.
That's all I know."

50:07.212 --> 50:10.257
He's walking around with a Yorkie
on a goddamn key chain.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.384
"I'll just take him with me."

50:12.467 --> 50:15.971
All I know is black Labs' lives
matter, nigga. I've know that.

50:18.056 --> 50:21.226
I had to defend my dawg
couple times in the year-- Steve Harvey.

50:21.309 --> 50:23.103
I had to come to his defense.

50:23.186 --> 50:26.523
First, about the Miss Universe shit.
Everybody was upset about it.

50:26.606 --> 50:30.694
I called him that night. I had to hit him
with the  Menace II Society.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.904
I'm like, "You know you fucked up, right?

50:33.947 --> 50:35.198
You know you fucked up?

50:35.282 --> 50:37.784
You fucked up. You fucked up."

50:41.455 --> 50:44.332
But a couple of months before that,
people was mad at him

50:44.416 --> 50:48.712
'cause he put Paula Deen on his talk show,
and everybody was mad, man.

50:48.795 --> 50:51.590
"Ced, why your boy got Paula Deen
on the talk show?"

50:51.673 --> 50:54.968
First of all, it's a talk show,
motherfucker. Hold on.

50:55.051 --> 50:56.762
Somebody got to be on there talking.

50:57.929 --> 51:01.475
Give him a minute, you know.
But I get it. I understand.

51:01.558 --> 51:04.060
Black people, we were mad
'cause Paula Deen, you know,

51:04.144 --> 51:07.439
real, on the low, we mad
Paula Deen said the N-word.

51:07.522 --> 51:10.525
'Cause, on the low,
we fucks with Paula Deen.

51:10.609 --> 51:13.403
'Cause Paula Deen cook
the way we like shit.

51:13.487 --> 51:17.783
So it kind of hurt us when
Paula Deen said the N-word at all.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.326
When Paula Deen be on TV, she like,

51:19.409 --> 51:22.996
"First, I'm gonna take some biscuits,
then put them in the oven,

51:23.079 --> 51:26.249
and I'm gonna take some butter
and put that on top of there,

51:26.333 --> 51:29.044
and then take some bacon
and crumble it on top

51:29.127 --> 51:31.922
and melt some cheese all over it.

51:32.005 --> 51:35.383
And we'll take some gravy
and sop it up through there."

51:35.467 --> 51:38.804
We be in the house like, "Oh, shit!

51:38.887 --> 51:44.267
God damn, Paula Deen, that shit
sounds good as a motherfucker there!"

51:44.351 --> 51:47.979
That's why it hurt us when she
said it. God damn, Paula Deen.

51:48.730 --> 51:51.858
When you think about it, anybody
cook a sweet potato pie that good,

51:51.942 --> 51:54.361
got to say nigga
every now and then, you know.

51:55.445 --> 51:57.614
But I ain't talking about
no egregious-ass shit.

51:57.697 --> 52:00.033
When you first taste it
to make sure it's good.

52:00.116 --> 52:03.537
You like, "Nigga! Yeah.

52:11.378 --> 52:12.796
Nigga.

52:13.713 --> 52:16.883
Might want to get you a little piece
of that right there, boy.

52:17.926 --> 52:19.636
Nigga.

52:24.933 --> 52:26.393
Nigga."

52:28.186 --> 52:31.481
Animals all mad and shit.

52:31.565 --> 52:34.651
So much shit going on,
like, animals are upset.

52:34.734 --> 52:37.821
Rightly so.
In Ohio, a couple of years ago,

52:37.904 --> 52:41.491
this dude had, like, a zoo at his house
with real zoo animals.

52:41.616 --> 52:44.828
He got up one day and let 'em go
in a regular-ass neighborhood.

52:44.911 --> 52:46.663
"Hyah! Get on out of here!

52:46.746 --> 52:49.082
Hyah! Hyah! Go on now!"

52:51.751 --> 52:54.588
That ain't for black people
right there, that shit.

52:54.671 --> 52:58.717
This nigga had lions and tigers
and bears, oh, my!

52:58.800 --> 53:03.013
You know us. We scared
when somebody's dog get loose.

53:03.096 --> 53:06.016
I couldn't even imagine walking
through a Walmart parking lot

53:06.099 --> 53:07.642
and seeing a loose-ass lion.

53:07.726 --> 53:09.311
Nigga, you like...

53:12.606 --> 53:14.608
"Is that a lion, nigga?

53:15.901 --> 53:17.611
Don't move! Don't move!

53:19.279 --> 53:21.406
I heard you ain't supposed to move."

53:22.240 --> 53:25.035
You be coming up with all kinds of shit.

53:25.118 --> 53:28.705
I don't even know what you supposed
to do you see a loose-ass lion.

53:28.788 --> 53:30.498
Somebody talk about "Run!"

53:30.582 --> 53:33.585
Nigga, your ass can't outrun no damn lion.

53:34.586 --> 53:39.341
I don't know about y'all, but I would
try to Jedi mind-trick that motherfucker.

53:39.424 --> 53:43.595
If I saw a loose-ass lion,
I would turn into a lion tamer.

53:43.678 --> 53:47.682
That lion came at me, I'll be like,
"Ha! Sit, Abar!

53:50.518 --> 53:52.646
I am Cedric!

53:54.814 --> 53:56.858
Hup! Sit!"

53:57.984 --> 54:02.280
The lion would be looking at me,
"Do I know you, motherfucker?"

54:02.364 --> 54:05.158
"I'm just trying not to get ate, Lion.

54:06.451 --> 54:08.828
Doing the best I can, you know."

54:10.538 --> 54:12.666
Saw this shit on YouTube the other day.

54:12.749 --> 54:15.752
This lady was at the zoo
and got kicked by a giraffe.

54:16.836 --> 54:21.299
I don't know what your ass did
to make a giraffe mad.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.593
Do you know how irritating
your ass gotta be

54:23.677 --> 54:26.846
for a giraffe to haul off
and kick the shit out of you?

54:27.847 --> 54:31.893
Giraffe is usually one of the cooler
animals at the damn zoo.

54:31.977 --> 54:37.232
They all long and lanky.
Be walking around like a ballplayer.

54:37.315 --> 54:41.695
They got the eyelashes
that's all fleek and shit, nigga.

54:42.696 --> 54:45.198
I don't know what this lady said,

54:45.281 --> 54:48.243
but that giraffe had had enough
of her ass.

54:48.326 --> 54:50.495
She up and said something,
that giraffe went like,

54:50.578 --> 54:53.289
"Bitch, shut the fuck up!"

54:54.666 --> 54:58.086
But he knew he had fucked up,
so that nigga ran off and shit.

55:05.176 --> 55:08.722
He tried to mix in
with the other giraffes and shit.

55:08.805 --> 55:11.433
They going, "We see your ass, Dwayne.

55:11.516 --> 55:14.352
You know damn well
you weren't supposed to kick that lady."

55:18.606 --> 55:22.152
And chickens have had a hard
couple of years. Ooh.

55:22.235 --> 55:25.822
It's got to be rough if you a damn chicken
when you think about it.

55:25.905 --> 55:29.284
'Cause chickens, man,
we love damn chicken.

55:29.367 --> 55:34.539
So if you a chicken, you can't be out
on the farm making plans and shit.

55:34.622 --> 55:37.500
Talking about, "Yeah, I think next
Saturday we should all get together

55:37.584 --> 55:39.127
and go over to Reggie's house--"

55:39.210 --> 55:41.254
Nigga, you going to be
86ed Wednesday.

55:41.337 --> 55:44.257
Your ass ain't gonna make it
to goddamn Saturday.

55:44.340 --> 55:47.385
You gonna be on somebody's grill,
dawg.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.807
There's been a lot of controversy
around chicken.

55:52.891 --> 55:56.102
The last couple of years--
It started with the Chick-fil-A man.

55:56.186 --> 55:59.314
The Chick-fil-A man didn't
want gay people to eat chicken.

55:59.397 --> 56:01.316
He made a statement and everything.

56:01.399 --> 56:04.277
"Your ass gay, don't come over here
and eat no motherfucking chicken."

56:05.111 --> 56:07.864
I could be paraphrasing.
I could be off a little bit.

56:07.947 --> 56:10.784
But I believe it's an exact quote
if you look it up.

56:10.867 --> 56:13.536
"Don't bring your punk ass here
to eat no goddamn chicken."

56:13.620 --> 56:16.206
I could be off by a word or two,

56:16.289 --> 56:18.458
but I believe it's somewhere
right in there.

56:18.541 --> 56:21.044
He's like, "Don't bring
your punk ass over here

56:21.127 --> 56:24.380
try to eat no goddamn chicken
up in here, is what I'm saying."

56:24.464 --> 56:27.175
Damn, Chick-fil-A man, that's aggressive.

56:28.635 --> 56:31.721
Black people, we had to deal
with it a couple of years ago

56:31.805 --> 56:33.848
with, you know, Mary J. Blige.

56:33.932 --> 56:36.601
She ended up singing
the chicken song for Burger King

56:36.684 --> 56:38.228
and that kind of offended us.

56:38.311 --> 56:42.107
Well, one, that's a stereotype
that we love chicken.

56:42.190 --> 56:43.858
You know. And we do.

56:45.568 --> 56:49.614
We just don't want no motherfucker
singing about that shit though.

56:49.697 --> 56:50.907
It's already hard enough.

56:50.990 --> 56:53.660
We can't eat watermelon
at the company picnic, nigga.

56:53.743 --> 56:55.662
We be at the company picnic like,

56:55.745 --> 56:58.998
"You know damn well y'all waiting on me
to get that goddamn watermelon.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.500
I ain't doing that."

57:00.583 --> 57:02.752
You like, "Trevor, put some watermelon
on your plate

57:02.836 --> 57:04.963
and bring that shit over here for me, man.

57:05.046 --> 57:06.631
I ain't doing that shit."

57:06.714 --> 57:09.801
I wasn't even really upset that
Mary J. had sang about chicken.

57:09.884 --> 57:13.763
I was more upset that she Mary J. Bliged
the shit more than anything.

57:34.325 --> 57:36.286
I was like, "Shit."
