Hello, I'm Judy Tobin.

00:38.522 --> 00:41.281
And I'm going to tell you
a story about a day.

00:41.433 --> 00:43.617
You know when you have one of

-You look like you do.
-Please don't point at me.

00:46.121 --> 00:48.438
One of those days when you get
to the drive-through at 11:05

00:48.532 --> 00:50.549
and they still sell you
a hash brown.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.626
Or when you fart
but someone else farts louder

00:52.720 --> 00:54.628
and at the same time.
Do you guys need more examples?

00:54.780 --> 00:56.613
I wouldn't mind one
or two more, honestly.

00:56.632 --> 01:00.375
I just need you to understand,
and I need you to understand...

It's a town a ferry ride away.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.871
It's just named that because,
during the Gold Rush,

03:43.966 --> 03:45.390
they used the cliff
for the death penalty.

Anyway, there's this
really cool café there

that has an over-21 open mic
every Friday.

03:54.884 --> 03:56.626
It's called
The Dark Side of the Mug.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.553

I intend to go there

Judy, we're going this Friday.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.083
The bouncer
got bad LASIK surgery,

04:11.310 --> 04:12.417
so he's been letting everyone in

04:12.569 --> 04:13.961
because he's too embarrassed
to admit he can't

04:14.146 --> 04:15.069
actually see the IDs.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.755
Wait, so we're gonna sneak in?

04:16.906 --> 04:18.982
Oh, um, well, I wish I could,

04:19.075 --> 04:22.335
but even if I got in, there's
no way they'd let me stay in.

04:22.488 --> 04:24.337
I'd be kicked out
'cause of my braces.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.822
They always give me away
as too young.

04:25.915 --> 04:28.249
Remember when I got turned away

04:28.269 --> 04:29.935
<i> Sex Vacation?</i> Trust me,

04:30.162 --> 04:31.603

but you'll have to go
to the open mic without me.

Judy, if you just want to come
over to my house instead,

04:36.335 --> 04:37.442

07:44.465 --> 07:45.872
through a series
of miscommunications,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.024
got trapped in a car trunk
for three days.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.634
I guess I better go look
in the mirror

07:49.786 --> 07:50.802
and sigh a little bit more.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.378
Good luck with
your sighing, Judy.

07:52.531 --> 07:54.030
Remember to breath
from your diaphragm!

07:54.123 --> 07:56.199
Okay, now I know everyone's
still devastated

07:56.218 --> 07:57.458
about Mrs. Toastie.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.144
But you know what
they say about grief:

07:59.295 --> 08:01.554
just swallow your pain,
try to forget about it,

08:01.707 --> 08:04.632
drink if you have to, then
move on as quickly as possible.

08:04.726 --> 08:07.635
So we went over to Junkyard
Kyle's to find a replacement.

08:07.729 --> 08:09.896
Meet... Mr. Toastie.

08:10.048 --> 08:11.231

08:48.678 --> 08:50.511
I know what you're thinking.
That my feelings

08:50.531 --> 08:52.589
about getting my braces off
were somehow related

08:52.682 --> 08:54.924
to the dread I was having
about actually

08:55.018 --> 08:56.943
sneaking into
a 21-and-over open mic.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.762
Ugh. Is anybody else's
table wobbly?

08:58.855 --> 09:00.705
Oh, my God, Steven,
pay attention!

09:07.439 --> 09:08.772
You want me to wait for you
for lunch?

09:08.790 --> 09:12.108
Oh, no, you go ahead.
I'll catch up in a minute.

09:12.127 --> 09:14.261
(Judy sighs)

09:16.464 --> 09:17.280
(sighs heavily)

09:17.299 --> 09:19.449
(groans) Okay, fine.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.726
I'm engaging.
What's going on, Judy?

09:21.953 --> 09:24.712
I just have a lot of emotions
in my body currently.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.623
Mostly happy ones, I think.

09:26.716 --> 09:28.716
Happy, huh? That's why
you stayed in here for lunch,

09:28.810 --> 09:29.901
to sit alone with a teacher?

09:30.128 --> 09:32.070
I'm getting my braces
off tomorrow.

09:32.221 --> 09:34.221
Okay, that seems... good?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.648
Well, it's just... (sighs)

09:35.801 --> 09:37.725
You know, at first I thought
I didn't want them off

09:37.819 --> 09:39.226
because it's kind of my<i> thang.</i>

09:39.246 --> 09:40.912
-Judy, no.
-Sorry. Thing.

09:41.064 --> 09:42.989
But I stayed up all night
worrying about it

09:43.141 --> 09:44.732
and now I think
it might be more than that.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.418
Maybe it's not about the braces,

09:46.645 --> 09:48.828
but it's about what they,
uh, symbolize.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.788
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
I don't follow.

09:50.941 --> 09:53.240
Ugh! I'm eating lunch
in the bathroom from now on.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.002
Listen, maybe this is less about
what you're leaving behind

09:56.096 --> 09:58.079
and more about what you're
heading towards.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.099
You know? You have braces
when you're...?

10:01.326 --> 10:02.158
Me?

10:02.177 --> 10:03.268
Young. When you're young, Judy.

10:03.495 --> 10:04.510
Getting your braces off means

10:04.663 --> 10:05.920
you won't look
like a kid anymore.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.347
It's a big step
towards adulthood.

10:07.499 --> 10:08.773
And maybe you've picked up
from pop culture

10:08.925 --> 10:11.276
that all adults do is sit around
and long for their youth,

15:15.657 --> 15:18.917
It's so weird,
I have seen<i> Vanilla Sky.</i>

15:19.068 --> 15:21.644
What are you doing up
at 3:00 a.m., Judy?

15:21.663 --> 15:24.422
Oh, did inspiration strike?
Should I get the paint?

15:24.649 --> 15:26.407
I had a nightmare
about my braces.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.167
I mean, at first I thought
I didn't want them off

15:28.319 --> 15:30.094
because they were my thing--
you know, like...

15:30.321 --> 15:31.912
-Zach Braff's smile?
-Mm-hmm.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.765
But now I think
I should get my braces off

15:33.916 --> 15:35.249
because I don't want
to be held back.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.343
But that also means
I'm going to look old enough

15:37.495 --> 15:39.178
to sneak
into an over-21 coffee shop.

15:39.330 --> 15:40.587
Dark Side of the Mug?

15:40.607 --> 15:42.348
I once met
a ribbon dancer there.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.591
She stole a thousand dollars
from me.

15:44.686 --> 15:45.777
That's the place. Ugh!

15:46.004 --> 15:47.445
Soon I'll have to decide
where to go to college

15:47.596 --> 15:49.430
and how far away
I'll have to live from my family

15:49.524 --> 15:51.174
and whether I'll become
a doctor, or travel.

15:51.192 --> 15:53.009
I mean, there are
some aggressive mimes out there,

15:53.027 --> 15:55.269
and no matter how confident I am
in whatever decision I make,

15:55.363 --> 15:57.346
it could still turn out
horrible anyway.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.457
I want my braces on,
but I also want them off!

15:59.684 --> 16:01.701
How can I feel both
at the same time?

16:01.853 --> 16:04.611
Judy, that's kind of
what becoming an adult is.

16:04.739 --> 16:05.946
You're never really sure.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.207
You just make
the best choice you can

16:08.359 --> 16:09.801
and see what happens.

16:10.028 --> 16:12.119

Wolf, have you checked out

I haven't.

18:09.647 --> 18:10.646
Oh! You're right.

18:10.739 --> 18:11.905
It's a good-looking outlet.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.591
That's not what I mean.
All these years,

18:13.742 --> 18:17.077
and I didn't realize
it was a 130-volt outlet.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.671
Mrs. Toastie died
of natural causes.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.265
She was old, yeah, but she
was also a restaurant toaster.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.342
She could handle
that kind of power,

18:23.436 --> 18:25.770
-but these newer toasters can't.
-And here we thought

18:25.921 --> 18:27.830
there was something wrong
with our toasters.

18:27.923 --> 18:31.183
But the real problem was
actually buried a little deeper.

18:31.336 --> 18:33.669
Oh, yeah.
That happens sometimes.

18:33.688 --> 18:35.446
We should check out
the other outlets, too.

18:35.598 --> 18:37.356
Judy, will you... Judy?

18:37.508 --> 18:40.034
-Judy?
-(car horn honking)

18:40.936 --> 18:43.012

It's in five hours, Jude.

18:44.532 --> 18:46.699
But, hey, if you want to wait
in there, fine by me.

18:46.851 --> 18:48.108
I'll bring out a book.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.703
I was finally ready
to say goodbye to my braces

18:50.855 --> 18:52.855
and<i> hello</i> to adulthood.

18:52.874 --> 18:53.947
Finally is right.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.833
They have got to shut off
her microphone.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.376

<i> -HELENA: Judy.</i>

18:57.470 --> 18:58.861
Dr. Helena? You're back.

18:58.954 --> 19:01.030
I was in Orlando reconnecting
with an old boyfriend.

19:01.123 --> 19:02.974
Nothing like the stress
of a water park

19:03.201 --> 19:04.884

You ready?

19:04.978 --> 19:08.128
I'm really glad you'll be the
one removing my braces today.

19:08.222 --> 19:11.540
Removing your braces?
Is that what Dr. Gary said?

19:11.559 --> 19:13.726
Aw, what up, J-dawg?
Thought I heard the nerd alert.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.711
Ha-ha! Kidding. Kinda.

19:15.730 --> 19:17.897
Gary, why would you tell Judy
that her braces

19:18.049 --> 19:20.566
-are ready to come off?
-Um, I don't know if you heard
the nerd alert earlier,

19:20.718 --> 19:23.143
but Judy deals with that
every day, all the time.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.054

you have what we call

You'll need to keep your braces
on for a little bit longer,

19:56.679 --> 19:59.530
and possibly have them off and
on for the rest of your life.

19:59.757 --> 20:01.348

Judy's summarizing

20:12.453 --> 20:14.045
Thanks for letting us use
your basement

20:14.272 --> 20:17.440
for our over-16 open mic night,
Mrs. Beavers.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.500
Not a problem, kids.
I remember being too scared

20:19.610 --> 20:21.719
to sneak into adult-only spaces
when I was your age.

20:21.870 --> 20:25.056
-I still have to get drunk
to even walk into the DMV.
-(Steven scoffs)

20:25.283 --> 20:26.373
We weren't scared.

20:26.467 --> 20:27.950
The ferry price was
just way too high.

20:27.969 --> 20:29.952
Yeah, five dollars each. Crazy.

20:29.971 --> 20:31.562
Plus, I was terrified.
My cousin's friend

20:31.789 --> 20:34.290
did a CBD latte, and he thought
his friend Allen was a turkey,

20:34.383 --> 20:36.141
and he tried to stick him
in an oven.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.476
And it wasn't even Thanksgiving.

20:37.628 --> 20:38.903
Okay.
So that was my first piece.

20:39.054 --> 20:40.554
