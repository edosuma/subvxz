 <i>We all eat.</i>

00:09.801 --> 00:11.467
 <i>We all sleep.</i>

00:11.501 --> 00:14.734
 <i>We all dream.</i>

00:21.734 --> 00:22.734
WOMAN:
 <i>Manuel?</i>

00:24.100 --> 00:25.067
 <i>Can you hear me?</i>

00:27.784 --> 00:31.084
Manuel wake up
Huh?

00:32.116 --> 00:34.284
What?
What are you doing?

00:34.318 --> 00:38.117
What, what, what are...
what are you talking about?

00:38.151 --> 00:41.551
Geez, Manny,
are you all right?

00:41.585 --> 00:44.184
What do you mean?

00:44.218 --> 00:46.151
You wet the bed.

00:51.951 --> 00:55.117
 <i>Our dreams reveal us</i>
 <i>to ourselves.</i>

00:55.151 --> 00:56.251
 <i>The people we are.</i>

00:56.284 --> 00:57.850
Don't just shoot,
you gotta aim it.

00:57.884 --> 01:00.017
So when that site is in
the middle of the clown's mouth,

01:00.051 --> 01:02.451
then you shoot.
Okay, Daddy.

01:02.484 --> 01:05.184
 <i>The people we'd like to be.</i>

01:05.218 --> 01:07.551
Whoo! Yeah!

01:07.585 --> 01:09.384
You don't need much.

01:09.418 --> 01:11.551
Just a little push.

01:12.618 --> 01:15.051
Oh, hole in two!

01:15.084 --> 01:16.084
Hey!

01:16.117 --> 01:17.717
Ah, come on, boy!

01:20.984 --> 01:22.318
You guys have fun?

01:22.351 --> 01:24.218
Oh... sure did.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.218
(grunting):
All right.

01:29.618 --> 01:30.817
Here's your deposit.

01:30.850 --> 01:33.284
A lot of people tell me
the game's even more fun

01:33.318 --> 01:35.451
when they bring their own kid,
rather than renting one.

01:35.484 --> 01:37.418
I know. I heard that.

01:37.451 --> 01:39.618
You know how
to get one?

01:39.651 --> 01:41.451
I know people.

01:49.951 --> 01:51.184
(grunting):
Yeah.

01:54.318 --> 01:57.351
(sighing):
Wait a second, will you?

01:57.384 --> 01:58.884
What are you talking about--

01:58.917 --> 02:00.318
"heads blown off"?

02:05.284 --> 02:07.284
Mm... do me a favor,
look around.

02:07.318 --> 02:11.351
Sometimes... a kid will hide
under the bed, in a closet.

02:13.984 --> 02:15.351
All dead.

02:15.384 --> 02:19.951
No, I have no idea
where the mayor is.

02:19.984 --> 02:21.251
It's 5:52 in the morning.

02:21.284 --> 02:23.784
I'm guessing
that he's at home, asleep.

02:23.817 --> 02:26.850
Wait a second,
give me an address.

02:26.884 --> 02:28.884
How many children?

02:32.251 --> 02:34.551
No, don't move anything,
just lock it down.

02:34.585 --> 02:36.318
I'm maybe 35 minutes away.

02:36.351 --> 02:38.750
I'll be right down there.

 <i>And then there are my dreams.</i>

03:36.117 --> 03:37.977
Where is your head?

03:38.028 --> 03:42.828
You keep staring at the ceiling 
like your mind is somewhere else.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.961
Like your mind is on someone else.

03:49.132 --> 03:56.332
It's rude to pay a woman for her attention

03:57.021 --> 03:58.521
and then not give her any.

03:58.779 --> 04:00.845
MAN:
Speak English.

04:03.545 --> 04:06.211
You want English?

04:06.245 --> 04:08.845
Why'd you come to Indonesia?

04:08.879 --> 04:10.145
Go home to America.

04:14.111 --> 04:15.512
Where are you going?

04:15.545 --> 04:16.644
I'm going
to the airport.

04:16.678 --> 04:18.043
I'm going home.

04:18.077 --> 04:19.978
(scoffs)
I feel
like going home.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.978
You can't do that.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.111
You're intoxicated.

04:25.145 --> 04:26.378
Do you even have a ticket?

04:28.545 --> 04:32.944
Besides...
it's early in the morning.

04:32.978 --> 04:35.978
It's not time for traveling.

04:36.011 --> 04:39.845
It's time to make love.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.545
Keep the change.

05:19.378 --> 05:20.579
What's the matter?

05:20.612 --> 05:22.245
What's going on?

05:22.278 --> 05:24.978
A dream?
Ugh, yeah.

05:27.145 --> 05:29.545
You want to talk
about it?

05:29.579 --> 05:30.878
I don't know.

05:30.911 --> 05:35.212
I'm not sure there's anything
to talk about.

05:35.245 --> 05:36.945
Oh, wow.

05:36.978 --> 05:38.512
Well, that's a first.

05:42.111 --> 05:46.345
I mean,
it took place in Indonesia.

05:46.378 --> 05:49.011
I don't know anyone
in Indonesia.

05:50.545 --> 05:51.744
You would've
liked it, though.

05:51.778 --> 05:53.612
There was a naked
girl in it.

05:59.178 --> 06:01.545
This is weird.

06:01.579 --> 06:03.345
I just had the
exact same dream.

06:03.378 --> 06:05.445
Oh, really.

06:05.478 --> 06:06.778
Truly.

06:06.811 --> 06:11.945
Was there a guy in your dream
who got his head chopped off?

06:11.978 --> 06:13.778
No.

06:13.811 --> 06:15.711
I just had the
naked girl part.

06:15.744 --> 06:17.945
I see.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.412
You had a guy...

06:23.811 --> 06:26.378
Well, I hope you're happy.

06:26.412 --> 06:28.145
Now I'm afraid to
go back to sleep

06:28.178 --> 06:29.312
and finish the dream.

06:29.345 --> 06:32.078
Yeah, well,
welcome to my world.

I have a sore throat.

07:24.212 --> 07:25.811
What are you
talking about?

07:25.845 --> 07:27.711
Don't make me
say it again.

07:27.745 --> 07:30.145
It really hurts.

07:30.178 --> 07:32.278
Come here, Bridge.

07:38.345 --> 07:41.178
Let's have a
look at you.
No, don't, Daddy.

07:41.212 --> 07:43.112
(giggling loudly):
Hey, hey!

07:43.145 --> 07:44.578
Oh, what do you know?

07:44.611 --> 07:46.145
All cured.

07:46.178 --> 07:47.412
No, wait.

07:47.445 --> 07:50.845
That was my tickle throat,
not my talking throat.

07:50.878 --> 07:52.278
(chuckles)
Well, you can use

07:52.312 --> 07:53.544
your tickle throat
in school today.

07:53.578 --> 07:55.544
No one will know
the difference.

07:55.578 --> 07:57.711
Bridge...
Hmm?

07:57.745 --> 08:00.845
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

08:00.878 --> 08:02.578
No, you'll just
think it's stupid.

08:02.811 --> 08:05.878
Well, maybe, maybe not.

08:05.911 --> 08:08.711
Well, I had the funnest
dream last night,

08:08.744 --> 08:10.078
and I was sort of hoping

08:10.111 --> 08:12.711
that I could stay in bed
and have it again today.

08:12.744 --> 08:14.078
What kind of dream?

08:14.111 --> 08:16.078
It was a cartoon
with monkeys in it.

08:19.579 --> 08:20.612
BRIDGETTE:
Oh, no.

08:23.412 --> 08:24.412
Hello?

08:24.445 --> 08:26.278
If I swing by your house
in 20 minutes,

08:26.312 --> 08:29.111
could you join me for a
little trip to Paradise Valley?

08:29.145 --> 08:30.612
Uh, hang on a second.

08:30.645 --> 08:33.312
I have to ask my husband if he
can run the girls to school.

08:33.345 --> 08:36.111
Yes, I can run the
girls to school.

08:36.145 --> 08:37.910
And don't worry, Bridge,
if you start feeling

08:37.945 --> 08:40.860
a little feverish, I'll
just tickle you some more.

08:40.861 --> 08:43.561
Not funny, Daddy.

08:43.562 --> 08:44.629
Not...
Whoa!

08:44.661 --> 08:46.262
funny... Daddy.
(giggling)

08:46.295 --> 08:48.961
Not funny.

08:50.928 --> 08:53.529
So what are we
rushing off to see?

08:53.562 --> 08:56.595
Well, I can't seem to get a
straight answer on that one.

08:56.629 --> 08:58.861
I asked Detective Scanlon if
he thought it might be useful

08:58.895 --> 09:00.395
to have you on the scene,

09:00.428 --> 09:02.428
and he indicated that it
certainly couldn't hurt.

09:08.462 --> 09:09.961
You seem awfully thirsty.

09:09.995 --> 09:11.562
You okay?

09:11.595 --> 09:13.195
It's the heat.

09:13.228 --> 09:15.362
You'd think, after all these
years, a body would adjust.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.428
REPORTER:
But I don't understand.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.895
Why are we not being told
the exact nature of the crime?

09:25.578 --> 09:27.179
DINOVI:
You're not being told
the exact nature

09:27.212 --> 09:29.212
of the crime because the
investigation is ongoing

09:29.245 --> 09:30.277
and has not yet reached a stage

09:30.278 --> 09:31.678
where we can make
that determination.

09:31.712 --> 09:33.011
REPORTER 2:
Where is the mayor?

09:33.044 --> 09:35.244
We're hearing rumors
of a cult-like slaughter,

09:35.245 --> 09:36.478
a Manson-style killing spree.

09:36.511 --> 09:38.112
Shouldn't the mayor be here?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.444
I spoke with the mayor
early this morning.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.878
He's rushing back
from a fact-finding mission.

09:41.879 --> 09:44.145
I'm sure he'll have plenty
to say when he gets here.

09:44.178 --> 09:45.445
Sorry, folks.

09:45.478 --> 09:47.345
I'm afraid that's all
I have for now.

09:48.745 --> 09:50.211
Thank you.

09:50.245 --> 09:51.545
Thanks.

09:54.078 --> 09:55.944
Fact finding mission?

09:55.978 --> 09:57.478
That's what
his girlfriend said.

09:57.512 --> 09:59.412
A Las Vegas
fact finding mission.

09:59.445 --> 10:01.879
Apparently, that's where
all the best facts are found.

10:03.879 --> 10:05.011
Okay.

10:05.044 --> 10:06.078
My interest is piqued.

10:06.111 --> 10:08.678
What exactly are we
looking at here, Lee?

10:08.712 --> 10:10.211
Not exactly sure yet.

10:10.245 --> 10:13.311
Wealthy family-- mother,
father, three kids.

10:13.345 --> 10:14.845
Live-in help had
the weekend off.

10:14.879 --> 10:16.111
Housekeeper
lets herself in

10:16.145 --> 10:18.879
at 5:00 a.m., discovers
all of them shot to death.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.478
Was it a robbery?

10:20.512 --> 10:22.445
Maid says
nothing's missing.

10:22.478 --> 10:23.978
Family attorney's
on his way over

10:24.011 --> 10:25.712
with a locksmith
to look in the vault,

10:25.745 --> 10:28.712
but our guys are telling
me it hasn't been touched.

10:28.745 --> 10:30.944
Put your party clothes on,
I'll show you what we got.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.345
SCANLON:
We're guessing
the wife here

10:33.378 --> 10:35.345
heard the shots
from the family room

10:35.378 --> 10:37.412
and was standing, attempting
to get out of the tub

10:37.445 --> 10:38.412
when her attacker came

10:38.445 --> 10:40.678
to this doorway.

10:53.512 --> 10:55.311
There was no weapon present
when the first team

10:55.345 --> 10:58.412
of responding officers
showed up this morning.

10:58.445 --> 11:01.278
Doesn't appear to be
a murder-suicide.

11:01.311 --> 11:02.378
TV REPORTER:
Now for more on
the market sell-off...

11:04.078 --> 11:05.145
Honey?

11:06.911 --> 11:08.978
TV REPORTER:
...early warning
stock predicting...

11:12.178 --> 11:14.311
The kids were all
shot in their beds.

11:14.345 --> 11:16.145
Dog's in here, too.

11:23.412 --> 11:24.645
DEVALOS:
Allison?

11:26.011 --> 11:28.845
Yeah, I know, the kids.

11:28.879 --> 11:32.578
I'll take your word for it.

11:34.012 --> 11:35.244
We need to find out
everything we can

11:35.245 --> 11:36.478
about the man
of the house.

11:36.512 --> 11:39.412
Maybe... it's
a revenge killing.

11:39.445 --> 11:41.312
Pretty savage
form of revenge.

11:41.345 --> 11:42.679
Maybe the attorney will open

11:42.712 --> 11:45.412
the safe and tell us
the family jewels are missing.

11:45.445 --> 11:48.178
Sorry, guys, but I seriously
doubt this was a robbery.

11:48.211 --> 11:50.078
Why do you say that?

11:50.111 --> 11:51.345
That's an Armand Vartanian,

11:51.378 --> 11:52.478
probably worth three quarters

11:52.512 --> 11:54.211
of a million dollars.

11:54.245 --> 11:56.944
I mean, if you're looking
for something of value.

11:56.978 --> 12:00.211
I'm gonna visit
the powder room,

12:00.245 --> 12:02.078
then we'll be
on our way.

12:06.745 --> 12:08.745
See you in about an hour.

12:22.078 --> 12:23.944
Can I help you?

12:27.078 --> 12:28.779
I don't know.

12:28.811 --> 12:30.844
I'm gonna call the police.

12:30.878 --> 12:33.045
If you need help,
they can help you.

12:33.078 --> 12:34.512
What?

12:34.545 --> 12:35.712
I would really appreciate it

12:35.745 --> 12:37.612
if you could just wait
for them the sidewalk.

12:39.645 --> 12:41.745
This your house?

12:41.779 --> 12:43.578
Phoenix Police, this
is Allison Dubois

12:43.612 --> 12:45.145
with the District
Attorney's office.

12:45.178 --> 12:46.145
Phoenix?

12:46.178 --> 12:48.045
I'm in Phoenix?
I made the plane?

12:48.078 --> 12:50.645
I have a man here
standing on my front porch.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.312
No, you don't.

12:52.345 --> 12:53.578
No, no, you don't.

12:53.612 --> 12:54.811
I don't know who he is.

12:54.844 --> 12:56.211
He didn't identify himself.

12:56.245 --> 12:58.944
Oh, that's not true.
That's not true.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.211
My name's Clay Bicks.

13:00.245 --> 13:02.011
Clay Bicks.

13:02.045 --> 13:03.312
Oh, my God.

13:03.345 --> 13:05.278
(chuckles):
Hey...

13:05.312 --> 13:07.145
Clay.

13:08.178 --> 13:11.278
You cut your hair.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.811
What'd you say
your last name was?

13:12.844 --> 13:14.512
Dubois.

13:14.545 --> 13:15.712
Benoit.

13:15.745 --> 13:16.811
Allison Benoit.

13:19.044 --> 13:19.979
Al.

13:21.728 --> 13:23.461
Cut your hair, too.

13:24.312 --> 13:25.445
Come here, you.

13:25.478 --> 13:27.078
No, no, back up, back up.

13:27.111 --> 13:30.378
I, uh... it's been awhile
between showers, you know?

13:32.111 --> 13:33.145
I still can't believe

13:33.178 --> 13:36.211
they let me on the plane.

13:36.245 --> 13:38.378
God, you look great.

13:38.412 --> 13:39.978
Plane from where?

13:40.011 --> 13:41.245
Indonesia.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.078
Indonesia.

13:43.111 --> 13:44.645
Yeah, I'm a shooter--
photographer.

13:44.679 --> 13:47.078
You know, magazines,
wire services.

13:47.111 --> 13:48.545
Sounds dangerous.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.745
I know.

13:49.779 --> 13:53.512
I get a little anxious
just talking about it.

13:53.545 --> 13:55.345
What kind of idiot
goes over there,

13:55.378 --> 13:56.844
seeks work like that, huh?

13:58.111 --> 13:59.878
They do have
a couple of

13:59.911 --> 14:02.278
excellent bars, though.

14:02.312 --> 14:05.944
Damn, you look, uh... great.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.911
You look different.

14:08.944 --> 14:11.278
And how dare you change
when I wasn't looking?

14:11.312 --> 14:13.811
Well, it's a long time
since high school, Clay.

14:13.844 --> 14:15.378
Yeah... You got
kids now, huh?

14:15.412 --> 14:16.612
Mm-hmm.

14:16.645 --> 14:19.178
Yeah... Why'd you go
do that without me?

14:19.211 --> 14:22.612
What, just 'cause you ain't
seen me in 17, 18 years?

14:24.345 --> 14:26.779
Bet you're
married now, huh?

14:26.811 --> 14:29.078
Happy, well-adjusted.

14:29.111 --> 14:32.911
Bet you never get
stinking drunk.

14:32.944 --> 14:34.245
Bet you bathe every day.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.428
You know...

14:41.429 --> 14:44.661
I got a weird confession
to make.

14:44.694 --> 14:47.095
I been in a couple
of hairy spots in my life.

14:47.128 --> 14:49.694
Stared down a couple of
loaded barrels,

14:49.728 --> 14:52.529
had a couple of
scary helicopter rides.

14:52.561 --> 14:56.128
Got taken hostage once
for three days in Samoa.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.961
And you know that moment when
you're thinking, "This is it."

14:59.995 --> 15:02.828
You know,
the Clay Bicks Show is over.

15:04.728 --> 15:08.362
You know who'd keep
popping in my head?

15:08.395 --> 15:09.661
You.

15:09.694 --> 15:12.728
Ms. Benoit.

15:12.761 --> 15:15.295
Voted most likely
to stay in someone's head

15:15.328 --> 15:18.995
long after they've let them go.

15:19.028 --> 15:21.028
Maybe they shouldn't have.

15:27.095 --> 15:30.728
You're my favorite regret.

15:35.628 --> 15:37.429
You don't remember
getting on the plane?

15:38.462 --> 15:40.362
Nah, I was pretty loaded.

15:42.362 --> 15:44.228
And you don't remember
getting off here in Phoenix?

15:49.728 --> 15:51.128
Why don't you come in the house?

15:51.162 --> 15:52.928
We'll have a cup
of coffee, and...

16:04.638 --> 16:07.166
mom this is......???

16:07.167 --> 16:09.917
and ????

16:09.948 --> 16:11.226
so...????

16:11.227 --> 16:11.877
you know.do???

16:13.624 --> 16:15.290
Just...
I'll be there in a second.

16:16.874 --> 16:18.273
BRIDGETTE:
Are we having dinner yet?

16:18.274 --> 16:20.040
ARIEL: Uh, what are you
talking about?

16:20.041 --> 16:22.706
Daddy's not even home yet.
And it's, like, 5:30.

16:22.707 --> 16:24.207
And why are you
in your pajamas?

16:24.240 --> 16:25.641
Well, as soon
as dinner's over,

16:25.674 --> 16:26.973
I want to go
right to bed.

16:27.007 --> 16:28.973
Why?
I had the funnest
dream last night.

16:29.007 --> 16:31.274
It was a cartoon
called <i>The Monkeyheads,</i>

16:31.307 --> 16:32.841
and I can't wait
to see more of it.

16:32.874 --> 16:33.841
 <i>TheMonkeyheads?!</i>

16:33.874 --> 16:35.674
That's so over.

16:35.707 --> 16:37.507
That was on when
I was little.

16:37.541 --> 16:38.674
BRIDGETTE:
So? I don't care.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.073
I still like it.

16:42.140 --> 16:45.973
DEVALOS:
Yeah... my whole
morning's open.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.674
Just set the appointment,
e-mail me the time.

16:51.707 --> 16:54.174
Right. I'm home now.

16:54.207 --> 16:56.107
Just e-mail me the time.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.073
Okay.

16:58.107 --> 17:00.441
Whew... Damn.

17:00.474 --> 17:03.340
There are just some
days that can't end

17:03.374 --> 17:05.840
fast enough.

17:05.874 --> 17:07.707
Mmm! Smells good.

17:07.741 --> 17:09.741
Smells good.

17:11.741 --> 17:12.940
Call them back
and tell them

17:12.973 --> 17:13.973
you're not free
tomorrow morning.

17:14.007 --> 17:16.973
I called Dr. Berman.

17:17.007 --> 17:18.441
He remembered you.

17:18.473 --> 17:20.107
I made an appointment
for 10:30.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.840
I'll drive you.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.073
I'm a grown man.

17:24.107 --> 17:26.040
I can make my own
doctor's appointments,

17:26.073 --> 17:28.073
thank you very much.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.674
There's something
wrong, Manuel.

17:35.140 --> 17:38.140
I'm worried you're
falling apart inside.

17:39.140 --> 17:40.741
Sometimes, I wake up
in the morning,

17:40.774 --> 17:42.973
and you're laying
there and I...

17:43.007 --> 17:46.541
I think you're dead.

17:46.574 --> 17:49.007
I can't hear you breathe,
you're covered in sweat,

17:49.040 --> 17:50.307
you're white as a ghost.

17:50.340 --> 17:51.774
I'm fine.

17:51.808 --> 17:54.441
It's Phoenix-- it's
hot and I sweat.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.940
Tomorrow, I will
find a doctor.

17:55.973 --> 17:58.674
I will call and I will
make an appointment.

17:58.707 --> 18:01.741
And when the time comes,
I'll drive myself.

18:01.774 --> 18:04.874
Right now, I'm hungry,
and I'm, uh...

18:04.908 --> 18:06.874
gonna eat.

18:24.107 --> 18:27.140
How do you think
he knew where you lived?

18:27.824 --> 18:29.957
I have no idea.

18:29.990 --> 18:32.024
How do you think
he knew you'd be home?

18:32.057 --> 18:34.424
I have no idea.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.690
What do you think he wanted?

18:36.723 --> 18:40.257
(sighs):
I have no idea.

18:42.324 --> 18:44.990
I think maybe
I'm a little jealous.

18:47.057 --> 18:48.924
He's dead, Joe.

18:48.957 --> 18:50.257
Well, you know,
in some ways,

18:50.291 --> 18:52.291
that could give him
an unfair advantage.

19:00.158 --> 19:02.258
I don't think
he knows he's dead.

19:02.290 --> 19:04.924
What? You trying to get me
to feel sorry for him?

19:04.957 --> 19:06.024
I think maybe

19:06.057 --> 19:07.624
that's why he's here.

19:07.657 --> 19:10.690
Maybe that's why
he's waiting for me.

19:10.724 --> 19:13.091
I think maybe
I'm supposed to tell him.

19:13.124 --> 19:15.390
You don't think
he'll get the gist

19:15.423 --> 19:17.490
when he looks in the mirror
and there's nobody there?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.590
When the phone
stops ringing?

19:20.624 --> 19:22.891
When nobody bothers
to check his theater stub

19:22.924 --> 19:25.057
after he comes back
from the candy counter?

19:26.407 --> 19:27.808
I think they've
got a pretty good

19:27.840 --> 19:29.907
orientation system
already in place.

19:32.407 --> 19:34.474
Then why did I have
that encounter?

19:34.508 --> 19:35.840
And why was he brought here?

19:35.874 --> 19:38.773
I don't know, he needed
the extra frequent flier miles,

19:38.807 --> 19:40.040
figured an extra stopover?

19:40.074 --> 19:41.074
I believe these things

19:41.107 --> 19:42.341
happen to me for a reason.

19:42.374 --> 19:44.040
The challenge is
to have the patience

19:44.074 --> 19:46.740
to wait for the reason
to reveal itself.

19:46.773 --> 19:48.673
Hmm... profundity.

19:48.707 --> 19:51.574
If I dig it out, will you write
that in my high school yearbook?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.673
(singsong):
Someone is jealous.

19:55.707 --> 19:58.441
Of your high school boyfriend?
I think not.

20:00.274 --> 20:01.640
He was pretty wild.

20:01.673 --> 20:02.707
I was pretty wild.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.874
Well, he's not wild now.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.241
I'm sorry.

20:15.324 --> 20:19.124
I've really had
my fill of death today.

20:19.157 --> 20:21.624
I really have.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.507
Deputy Mayor DiNovi.
I'll tell you what I know.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.373
The Costigans all died
early this morning

20:29.407 --> 20:30.707
of close-range shotgun wounds.

20:30.741 --> 20:33.707
Preliminary investigations
suggest that the killings

20:33.741 --> 20:35.440
were not related to
Mr. Costigan's employment.

20:35.474 --> 20:38.208
We are aware of
similar home invasions

20:38.240 --> 20:40.074
in Wyoming and New Mexico

20:40.108 --> 20:41.941
during the last 12 months.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.141
Beyond that,
it's an active investigation.

20:44.174 --> 20:45.574
Hopefully, we'll know
more in the morning.

20:46.607 --> 20:48.007
WOMAN:
Do you have
anything to say

20:48.041 --> 20:50.474
to the people of Phoenix
who are obviously frightened?

20:52.474 --> 20:54.340
Phoenix is a safe city.

20:54.373 --> 20:56.741
But obviously, people need
to take precautions.

20:56.774 --> 20:58.774
Lock your doors,
lock your windows.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.041
Check in on your loved ones,

21:00.074 --> 21:01.941
check in on your neighbors,

21:01.974 --> 21:06.007
and know that we are
gonna find these people.

21:06.041 --> 21:08.041
We're gonna stop these people.

21:08.074 --> 21:10.941
REPORTER:
And what does the mayor have
to say about all this?

21:10.974 --> 21:13.373
DINOVI:
The mayor fell ill
prior to boarding a plane

21:13.407 --> 21:14.407
back to Phoenix this morning.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.407
(phone ringing)

21:19.574 --> 21:20.874
Hey.

21:20.907 --> 21:22.574
Yeah, I saw it;
of course I saw it.

21:22.607 --> 21:24.240
You were great.

21:24.273 --> 21:26.108
You couldn't hear me cheering
from over here?

21:27.474 --> 21:28.741
You coming over?

21:30.307 --> 21:31.507
I don't care.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.774
Ring the bell, wake me up.

21:33.807 --> 21:34.774
I mean it.

21:34.807 --> 21:35.841
2:00 in the morning.
Whenever.

21:35.874 --> 21:36.941
Wake me up.

21:55.407 --> 21:57.808
It was so random.

21:59.107 --> 22:01.907
They were so unprepared.

22:03.207 --> 22:07.541
I mean, in his wildest dreams,
could he have ever imagined

22:07.574 --> 22:11.607
that he would have died
lying on his belly...

22:11.641 --> 22:13.541
reading the paper?

22:13.574 --> 22:16.641
And the mom.

22:16.674 --> 22:20.674
Was she singing in the shower,
seconds before it happened?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.974
And the kids.

22:25.274 --> 22:27.241
What were they dreaming about

22:27.274 --> 22:29.707
before their lives
were snuffed out?

22:31.874 --> 22:34.474
Are you sure
everything's locked?

22:34.508 --> 22:36.374
I'll go check again.

23:49.007 --> 23:51.374
Mom?

23:52.474 --> 23:54.707
Mom?!

23:54.740 --> 23:57.141
Mom...!

24:02.007 --> 24:04.107
Mom, please!

24:05.707 --> 24:07.107
Mom!

24:07.141 --> 24:08.508
Help!

24:15.874 --> 24:17.107
BRIDGETTE:
Mommy...

24:17.141 --> 24:20.374
I just had a bad dream.

24:21.673 --> 24:23.341
Yeah, me, too.

24:25.623 --> 24:27.106
You know you don't have
to go to bed early

24:27.107 --> 24:28.940
to see <i>The Monkeyheads,</i>
they're all out on DVD.

24:28.974 --> 24:30.074
Well, I don't care!

24:30.107 --> 24:31.574
I hate <i>The Monkeyheads!</i>

24:31.608 --> 24:34.107
Somebody had
a nightmare last night.

24:34.141 --> 24:36.407
So that's what you were doing
in our bed

24:36.441 --> 24:38.608
this morning.
Well, Monkeyheads are scary.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.740
Monkeyheads aren't scary,
they're just stupid.

24:40.773 --> 24:42.207
You're stupid!

24:42.241 --> 24:43.341
Nobody's stupid.

24:43.374 --> 24:44.374
Marie, baby, we're all out

24:44.407 --> 24:46.074
of Nutty Wutteys.
How about

24:46.107 --> 24:48.441
some flakes?

24:48.474 --> 24:50.474
We have millions of kinds
of flakes.

24:50.508 --> 24:52.307
I want some eggs!

24:53.474 --> 24:54.974
Did you see this?

24:55.007 --> 24:57.241
How do you feel about frying
your daughter some eggs,

24:57.274 --> 24:58.274
so I could sit down

24:58.307 --> 24:59.907
and have myself
a cup of...
Oh, sure.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.740
I'm done.
I'm done.

25:01.773 --> 25:04.007
Daddy's making you eggs.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.141
Thanks, Daddy.

25:06.174 --> 25:08.107
So, I know that Bridgette
had a nightmare.

25:08.141 --> 25:10.341
Tell me about your nightlife.

25:10.374 --> 25:11.840
Any visits from old boyfriends?

25:11.874 --> 25:13.074
No.

25:13.107 --> 25:15.341
I suppose he figured out
where he was supposed to be,

25:15.374 --> 25:16.974
and how to get there,
all by himself.

25:17.007 --> 25:18.541
What do you mean?
Are you telling me

25:18.574 --> 25:20.974
that you actually had
a sound night's sleep?

25:21.007 --> 25:22.673
I didn't say that;
I just didn't see

25:22.707 --> 25:25.007
any news you can use,
if you know what I mean.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.807
Nothing about Clay,

25:26.840 --> 25:28.608
nothing about this.

25:28.640 --> 25:32.307
I did have a terryfying dream
about a little  b-o-y.

25:32.341 --> 25:34.541
That took place I
don't know where,

25:34.574 --> 25:37.508
I don't know when,
involving I don't know who.

25:37.541 --> 25:38.640
Isn't that what you said

25:38.673 --> 25:39.940
about your Indonesian nightmare?

25:39.974 --> 25:42.374
I mean, before you realized who
and what it was really about.

25:43.407 --> 25:46.840
Well, that's what has me
so worried.

25:53.324 --> 25:54.874
Oh, Lee.

25:55.907 --> 25:56.789
Can I talk to you
about something?

25:56.790 --> 25:58.457
I don't know if it
means anything but... 

25:58.491 --> 25:59.923
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

25:59.957 --> 26:02.624
You mind taking a ride,
we'll talk in the car?
Sure.

26:02.658 --> 26:04.658
What's going on?

26:05.823 --> 26:07.823
Some hikers spotted a
minivan, sitting upside-down

26:08.057 --> 26:11.441
in a couple feet of water.
?????es in it.

26:11.574 --> 26:12.474
There are.

26:12.508 --> 26:13.840
A mother and her son.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.707
Okay.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.441
And you wanted to
talk to me about...?

26:19.474 --> 26:21.474
We just covered it.

26:30.508 --> 26:32.740
Someone slept alone
last night.

26:33.807 --> 26:36.141
You really are psychic.

26:37.408 --> 26:37.507
Ha, ha.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.274
Shaving cream.
Yeah, clever.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.974
No woman would let a man
leave home like that.

26:42.007 --> 26:43.707
Yeah, well, wasn't
for lack of trying.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.740
She's just been working
all hours.

26:45.773 --> 26:48.074
Between this home invasion thing
and the mayor

26:48.107 --> 26:49.474
flaking out.

26:49.508 --> 26:50.807
Hm.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.523
How old were you
when you got married?

26:55.524 --> 26:57.624
Me? Um... nine.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.424
I've been married 12 years.

26:59.457 --> 27:00.923
So, yeah, nine, mm-hmm.

27:00.957 --> 27:03.290
Yeah, well, I'm
pushing 14 myself.

27:07.057 --> 27:09.657
You know, I never really
lived with anyone.

27:09.691 --> 27:11.324
Not long-term.

27:11.357 --> 27:14.157
Hey, if it works for you.

27:14.190 --> 27:16.791
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure
it does anymore.

27:17.558 --> 27:20.324
Tough to make the leap.

27:22.007 --> 27:25.974
But I'm thinking there might be
some leaping in my future.

27:27.007 --> 27:29.141
Well, go on, Baryshnikov.

27:43.373 --> 27:45.423
You can see where the big SUV
pushed against it,

27:45.424 --> 27:46.590
forced it off the road.

27:48.423 --> 27:51.057
Maybe.

28:04.124 --> 28:05.073
It's just so eerie.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.840
Everything I dreamt about
happened.

28:06.874 --> 28:10.407
Well, that has to give you
some sense of satisfaction.

28:10.441 --> 28:11.874
No, it doesn't.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.307
I feel like
a walking carnival trick.

28:14.341 --> 28:17.407
I dreamt about this little boy
drowning to death.

28:17.441 --> 28:18.541
What do you know?

28:18.574 --> 28:19.874
It really happened.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.107
What is the point?

28:21.141 --> 28:23.840
Why show it to me
if I can't prevent it?

28:23.874 --> 28:26.707
So I have answers
for the police questions

28:26.740 --> 28:29.107
15 minutes before they
would have them otherwise?

28:29.141 --> 28:30.840
You know, um, 

28:30.874 --> 28:33.508
a very intuitive lady
once said to me...

28:33.541 --> 28:36.341
"I believe these things happen
to me for a reason,

28:36.374 --> 28:38.107
"and the challenge is having
the patience

28:38.141 --> 28:40.508
to wait for the reason
to reveal itself."

28:40.541 --> 28:42.007
Oh, zip it.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.807
Anyway, I called Mrs.
Pasternack down the street.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.508
She's going to take the girls
home with her.

28:47.541 --> 28:50.107
So if you could stop by
her place on the way home...

28:50.141 --> 28:52.773
Thy will be done.

28:57.274 --> 28:59.107
CRIME TECH:
Everything we can do
here, we've done.

28:59.141 --> 29:00.241
The rest of it

29:00.274 --> 29:01.940
really ought to happen
back at the lab.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.007
I made a call-- flatbed's
on its way out here.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.707
Anything you want to share?

29:05.740 --> 29:06.907
Well, wherever
they were going,

29:06.940 --> 29:09.508
they knew it was going to
take them a while to get there.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.940
Car's full of clothes,
toiletries...

29:11.974 --> 29:13.074
No maps, though.

29:13.107 --> 29:15.074
No tickets or brochures.

29:15.107 --> 29:16.174
You get the feeling that maybe

29:16.207 --> 29:17.441
it was
a pretty spontaneous trip.

29:17.474 --> 29:19.508
But you got a lot of
the kinds of things

29:19.541 --> 29:23.107
you see on a long road trip,
like DVDs for the kid,

29:23.141 --> 29:25.374
fast food wrappers,
juice boxes...

29:25.407 --> 29:27.341
What's this?
It was in the player.

29:27.374 --> 29:28.974
They must've had it on

29:29.007 --> 29:30.740
when they went over the side--
 <i>The MonkeyHeads.</i>

29:30.773 --> 29:33.007
Did you say <i>Monkeyheads?</i>

29:33.040 --> 29:34.307
Mm-hmm.

29:34.341 --> 29:36.207
SCANLON:
What's the big deal?

29:36.241 --> 29:37.508
Does that mean something?

29:37.541 --> 29:38.517
(gasping):
Oh, boy...

29:49.524 --> 29:50.756
Hey, I'm home.

29:50.757 --> 29:53.358
Shh, shh, shh.
You'll wake the baby.

29:53.391 --> 29:54.840
Marie's already down?

29:54.841 --> 29:56.074
Have you looked
at your watch?

29:56.108 --> 29:57.741
It's after 9:00.

29:57.774 --> 30:00.273
Wow.
You do good work.

30:00.307 --> 30:01.574
What about Bridgette?

30:01.607 --> 30:03.074
I really need to
talk to Bridgette.

30:03.108 --> 30:04.207
Well, I don't know,

30:04.240 --> 30:05.841
she's been in bed
for half an hour,

30:05.874 --> 30:07.941
but I couldn't tell you
if she's asleep or not,

30:07.974 --> 30:09.841
'cause she fought me
every step of the way.

30:09.874 --> 30:11.907
Three days ago, she couldn't
wait to get to bed,

30:11.941 --> 30:12.974
and now she acts like

30:13.008 --> 30:14.607
I'm sending her off
to the electric chair.

30:14.641 --> 30:16.008
You going to have
some food?

30:16.041 --> 30:17.907
Later.
(sighs)

30:18.941 --> 30:20.907
Did you feel that?

30:20.941 --> 30:22.041
What?

30:22.074 --> 30:23.440
That blast of cold air?

30:23.474 --> 30:26.607
What are you talking about?

30:26.641 --> 30:29.741
I don't even think
the air-conditioning's on.

30:29.774 --> 30:29.940
I don't know.

30:29.941 --> 30:31.374
I've been
feeling them all night.

30:32.407 --> 30:34.108
Maybe it's just my imagination.

30:34.140 --> 30:37.273
Maybe you're going through
the change of life.

30:37.307 --> 30:38.807
Ah, could be.

30:45.507 --> 30:47.774
(whispering):
Bridgette.

30:47.807 --> 30:49.407
Bridgette?

30:51.474 --> 30:53.474
Hey. Hey.

30:53.507 --> 30:55.374
(gently):
Hey...

30:55.407 --> 30:56.974
What are you doing
with this?

30:57.008 --> 30:58.507
This is your sister's.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.140
Well, I wasn't hurting it.

31:00.173 --> 31:02.008
I was just listening to it.

31:02.041 --> 31:03.874
Well, you're not supposed
to be listening to it,

31:03.907 --> 31:05.774
you're supposed
to be asleep.

31:05.807 --> 31:07.607
Well, I don't want to be asleep.

31:07.641 --> 31:09.340
Sleeping is scary.

31:09.374 --> 31:11.607
I seeMonkeyheads 
when I sleep.

31:11.641 --> 31:14.440
And why is that scary?

31:14.474 --> 31:16.540
Monkeyheads aren't scary.
Monkeyheads are funny.

31:16.574 --> 31:18.641
No, no, they're not.
Not lately.

31:18.674 --> 31:20.874
Really?

31:22.507 --> 31:24.641
Tell me what you've seen.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.140
Well, the other night,

31:27.173 --> 31:29.841
this mama monkey
and this baby monkey,

31:29.874 --> 31:30.974
they were in their car,

31:31.008 --> 31:33.374
and then these bad monkeys
chased them

31:33.407 --> 31:35.207
and chased them

31:35.240 --> 31:38.374
and then pushed them right off
the road and into this lake.

31:38.407 --> 31:40.140
And then?

31:40.173 --> 31:41.741
And then they just sat there,

31:41.774 --> 31:44.507
and they were upside-down,
and they were bleeding,

31:44.540 --> 31:46.741
and the car got filled
up all with water.

31:46.774 --> 31:48.307
And they just sat there.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.041
And then they were breathing
funny little cartoon bubbles.

31:51.074 --> 31:54.240
And then they
finally fell asleep,

31:54.273 --> 31:56.474
and turned into Angel Monkeys,

31:56.507 --> 31:59.340
and floated out the car
and up to heaven.

32:03.074 --> 32:05.041
Sweetie...

32:05.074 --> 32:07.941
Well, I can see why
you wouldn't want to have

32:07.974 --> 32:10.641
another dream like that.

32:10.674 --> 32:12.907
But here's
the thing, Bridge--

32:12.941 --> 32:16.641
I am almost 100% sure

32:16.674 --> 32:19.474
that the bad dreams are over.

32:19.507 --> 32:22.841
I really think it's okay
to go back to sleep.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.941
You do?
I do.

32:24.974 --> 32:27.207
And if, for some strange reason,
I'm wrong,

32:27.240 --> 32:29.340
you can come into my bed.

32:29.374 --> 32:33.340
But... I don't think I'm wrong.

32:33.374 --> 32:35.273
I think the bad dream
is over.

32:35.307 --> 32:36.974
Well, I hope so.

32:37.008 --> 32:39.474
'Cause it's really tiring
trying not to sleep.

32:41.941 --> 32:43.140
She dreamt it, too.

32:43.173 --> 32:44.707
The little boy, 
the drowning.

32:44.741 --> 32:46.240
What are you
talking about?

32:46.273 --> 32:48.607
She dreamt a cartoon version
of the same thing I did.

32:48.641 --> 32:50.474
Cartoon?

32:50.507 --> 32:52.440
Why a cartoon?

32:52.474 --> 32:53.941
The little boy

32:53.974 --> 32:55.807
was watching cartoons
when he drowned.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.741
I suppose he was trying to make
peace with the way he died,

32:58.774 --> 33:01.607
trying to find someone
to tell his story to.

33:01.641 --> 33:04.540
They're about
the same age.

33:04.574 --> 33:06.974
I hate that she dreams
that stuff.

33:07.008 --> 33:08.407
I know.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.774
For what it's worth,
I think she's okay.

33:11.807 --> 33:14.074
She really thinks
it is a cartoon.

33:14.108 --> 33:17.240
A scary cartoon,
but still a cartoon.

33:17.273 --> 33:18.974
And I do think it's over.

33:19.008 --> 33:21.273
Oh...

33:21.307 --> 33:22.774
God.

33:22.807 --> 33:24.440
Tell me you don't feel that.

33:24.474 --> 33:26.074
Feel what?

33:26.108 --> 33:27.440
It's like arctic.

33:27.474 --> 33:30.574
You didn't feel
that cold blast of air?

33:30.607 --> 33:34.540
Come here, let me
feel your head.

33:40.008 --> 33:42.041
You don't feel feverish.

33:42.074 --> 33:43.607
But why don't you go
lay down in bed?

33:43.641 --> 33:45.041
I'll be in in a minute.

33:45.074 --> 33:46.240
I don't feel sick.

33:46.273 --> 33:48.074
I don't know what to tell you.

33:48.108 --> 33:49.674
It's Phoenix, Arizona.

33:49.707 --> 33:52.240
If you're feeling the chills,
you're getting sick.

33:52.273 --> 33:53.574
Just go.

33:53.607 --> 33:56.440
I'll clean up.
I'll lock up.

34:14.907 --> 34:17.341
Hey, Al.

34:17.373 --> 34:20.007
Sorry about the cold.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.940
I hear it goes away,
eventually, though.

34:24.306 --> 34:26.107
What else have you heard?

34:26.139 --> 34:29.541
Oh... that you can see me.

34:29.574 --> 34:31.808
That you can hear me.

34:31.840 --> 34:35.607
That, uh, that's pretty rare.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.973
I am really sorry, Clay.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.623
The other day,
outside my house...

34:42.623 --> 34:43.739
I wasn't sure.

34:43.739 --> 34:46.041
I thought you might be...

34:46.074 --> 34:47.806
But I wasn't sure.

34:49.841 --> 34:52.706
I'm really glad you're here.

34:52.739 --> 34:56.308
I'm really glad
I get to say good-bye.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.107
Don't be sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.

34:58.141 --> 35:01.473
Truth is, I've been flirting
with this all my life.

35:01.507 --> 35:04.041
Now that I'm here...

35:04.074 --> 35:07.674
it's not like the view's
all that bad.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.141
You know what
else I heard?

35:12.174 --> 35:13.907
What's that?

35:13.941 --> 35:17.208
That if I try hard enough,

35:17.241 --> 35:21.574
that if I want it bad enough,

35:21.607 --> 35:25.340
sometimes, someone like me

35:25.373 --> 35:29.241
can be felt...

35:29.274 --> 35:31.574
by someone like you.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.574
I have to tell you,
I've never...

35:33.607 --> 35:35.707
Allison?

35:35.740 --> 35:37.440
Do you want a hand
locking up?

35:39.740 --> 35:42.007
Uh... sure.

35:42.041 --> 35:45.007
Absolutely.

35:54.574 --> 35:56.241
Hello, Detective.

35:56.274 --> 35:57.490
Your deputy-ship.

35:57.491 --> 35:59.090
Haven't seen you
in a couple of days.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.491
You know what's been going on.

36:00.524 --> 36:02.624
I look up from my desk,
it's 11:00 at night.

36:02.657 --> 36:03.957
Well, the mayor's
back in town now.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.724
I saw it right on the
front page of the paper.

36:05.758 --> 36:07.758
No reason for you not
to come over tonight.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.557
Well, then maybe I will.

36:09.591 --> 36:11.758
Well, if you ring the bell,
maybe I'll let you in.

36:11.791 --> 36:13.057
10:00-ish okay?

36:13.090 --> 36:14.739
I got a call from this woman
in the third district.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.141
Worked on our last campaign.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.340
Wants to buy me a drink.

36:17.373 --> 36:18.440
She was very insistent.

36:18.473 --> 36:20.540
You sure it was a woman?

36:21.924 --> 36:23.306
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

36:23.307 --> 36:24.541
Oh, um...

36:24.574 --> 36:28.541
So... 10:00-ish.

36:34.940 --> 36:36.940
Hey.

36:36.974 --> 36:38.907
Hey.

36:38.940 --> 36:41.207
(clears throat)
Allison here yet?

36:41.241 --> 36:43.441
She's the one who wanted
to have this meeting.

36:43.474 --> 36:46.174
I've got a doctor's thing
this afternoon,

36:46.207 --> 36:47.608
desk full of work.

36:47.641 --> 36:50.307
Excuse me.

36:52.140 --> 36:54.241
SCANLON:
The dead woman, the
driver of the minivan,

36:54.274 --> 36:56.107
name is Olga Bankova.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.608
She's a naturalized
U.S. citizen,

36:57.641 --> 37:00.207
34 years old, single mother,
artist of some kind.

37:00.241 --> 37:01.974
Also works as a substitute
teacher; no priors.

37:02.007 --> 37:04.641
They were over 200 miles
from home when they died.

37:04.674 --> 37:07.174
The child in the backseat
was her son Ian.

37:07.207 --> 37:08.174
Seven years old.

37:08.207 --> 37:10.407
What else do we know?
Not much.

37:10.441 --> 37:12.307
We're checking paint and body
shops around the state,

37:12.341 --> 37:14.608
looking for any large vehicles
with horizontal abrasions

37:14.641 --> 37:15.907
consistent with
the minivan's.

37:15.940 --> 37:18.407
So...

37:18.441 --> 37:20.940
we're certain the car
was pushed into that lake bed?

37:20.974 --> 37:23.474
No.
Yes.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.507
No one in the crime lab
is willing to say

37:25.541 --> 37:27.341
in a definitive way that the
minivan was actually pushed

37:27.374 --> 37:28.239
into that lake bed.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.656
Yes, there's paint on the car,
yes, the side is scraped

37:30.657 --> 37:31.890
consistent with that kind
of scenario

37:31.924 --> 37:33.458
but the vehicle also took
about a 40-foot fall,

37:33.491 --> 37:34.857
which could account
for the damage

37:34.890 --> 37:37.157
and the mismatched paint could
also be from a previous mishap.

37:37.191 --> 37:38.491
That coupled with the fact
that no one

37:38.524 --> 37:40.324
can seem to come up
with any kind of motive...

37:40.357 --> 37:42.257
I know that she was pushed
off the road.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.091
I saw it happen.
My daughter saw it, too.

37:44.124 --> 37:46.157
Your daughter?

37:46.191 --> 37:47.458
Really?

37:47.491 --> 37:48.690
Did either one of you,
perchance,

37:48.723 --> 37:50.191
see who was driving
the other vehicle?

37:50.224 --> 37:53.157
I didn't, no.

37:54.941 --> 37:55.889
What about your daughter?

37:55.890 --> 37:58.723
My daughter doesn't have any
information you could use.

37:58.757 --> 37:59.990
I don't understand.

38:00.024 --> 38:02.324
I'm gathering that, like you,

38:02.357 --> 38:04.090
your daughter saw all this
in a dream.

38:04.124 --> 38:06.591
Don't you think
it might be useful to us

38:06.624 --> 38:08.857
to interview her, see
if we couldn't piece together

38:08.890 --> 38:10.357
some kind of description?

38:10.391 --> 38:12.857
I'm familiar with a number of
people from around the state

38:12.890 --> 38:14.357
who have a lot of expertise

38:14.391 --> 38:15.857
when it comes
to interviewing children.

38:15.890 --> 38:18.690
I mean, we'd have to finesse
the whole dream thing,

38:18.723 --> 38:20.857
but I'm sure
it could be handled.

38:22.890 --> 38:27.057
She saw them,
but she didn't see them.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.623
Look, it was a cartoon.

38:29.657 --> 38:31.257
She saw the whole thing
as a cartoon.

38:31.291 --> 38:35.124
The people who pushed
the minivan off the road

38:35.157 --> 38:37.291
were cartoon people.

38:37.324 --> 38:41.157
Everybody was a cartoon.

38:43.224 --> 38:46.324
I see.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.807
Any news
on the home invasion front?

38:48.841 --> 38:50.308
SCANLON:
Not really. No.

38:50.340 --> 38:52.308
Place turned out to be
amazingly clean.

38:52.340 --> 38:53.907
I mean,
clearly these guys were pros.

38:53.941 --> 38:56.473
Aha.

38:56.507 --> 38:58.822
No leads
on the home invasion front.

38:58.823 --> 39:00.457
Dark cartoon forces at work,

39:00.491 --> 39:02.157
pushing vehicles off
our thoroughfares.

39:02.191 --> 39:04.057
It's a wonderful day
to be the district attorney.

39:04.090 --> 39:05.924
Excuse me?

39:05.957 --> 39:07.624
You're excused.

39:09.424 --> 39:12.290
(mimics):
"It's a wonderful day
to be the district attorney."

39:12.291 --> 39:13.789
You know the man's under
a lot of pressure.

39:13.790 --> 39:15.822
That's not the point.
It was mean.

39:15.823 --> 39:16.957
It was needlessly mean.

39:16.990 --> 39:18.157
He's not himself.

39:18.191 --> 39:19.591
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

39:19.624 --> 39:21.457
Who are you guys talking about?
Nobody.

39:21.491 --> 39:23.291
You know, all they're talking
about on the radio is

39:23.324 --> 39:24.624
how these guys are
still out there,

39:24.658 --> 39:26.723
it's just a matter of time
before they do it again.

39:26.757 --> 39:28.090
Okay, I get it.

39:28.124 --> 39:30.491
He's under a lot of pressure
on that case,

39:30.524 --> 39:32.090
and I'm not helping him
on that case.

39:32.124 --> 39:33.257
Well, I'm sorry.

39:33.291 --> 39:34.890
I wish I could pick and choose
what I dream

39:34.924 --> 39:36.424
on any given day, but I can't.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.790
So it isn't
the crime du jour.

39:37.823 --> 39:39.291
I can't help that.

39:39.324 --> 39:41.857
I see what I see, and I know
what I know and my daughter...

39:41.890 --> 39:43.191
Uh-uh...
I think you're blowing this

39:43.224 --> 39:45.057
way out of proportion.
My daughter

39:45.090 --> 39:46.890
doesn't get to specify
the style of presentation

39:46.924 --> 39:50.024
when someone reaches out to her
from the great beyond

39:50.057 --> 39:52.191
to tell her something.
"Well, I'm sorry,

39:52.224 --> 39:54.057
we're not accepting
cartoon dreams today."

39:54.090 --> 39:56.990
The district attorney prefers
his clues from the other side

39:57.024 --> 39:58.624
more straightforward.

39:58.658 --> 39:59.990
More crime, less character.

40:00.024 --> 40:01.957
More like an episode
of <i>Law & Order.</i>

40:01.990 --> 40:02.957
Allison.

40:02.990 --> 40:04.558
Are you talking about me?

40:04.591 --> 40:06.157
No, honey, 
nobody's talking about you.

40:06.191 --> 40:07.957
Nobody's talking about anybody.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.391
I need a bath.

40:11.857 --> 40:13.257
Is something wrong, Mommy?

40:13.291 --> 40:14.558
It's not you guys.

40:14.591 --> 40:16.524
Mommy just had a hard day.

40:17.591 --> 40:20.658
No, I'm, uh, I'm still here.

40:20.690 --> 40:22.524
Of course.
I know it's dinnertime.

40:22.558 --> 40:23.857
He just wanted
to run some tests,

40:23.890 --> 40:26.790
and I'm just sitting here
waiting for the results.

40:28.491 --> 40:30.157
I'll call you when I'm done.

40:30.191 --> 40:31.823
I love you, too.

40:43.624 --> 40:45.624
I've been guarding
it with my life.

40:45.658 --> 40:48.291
I appreciate it.

40:54.024 --> 40:55.823
Yeah?

40:56.857 --> 40:58.324
Bridge and Marie are down.

40:58.357 --> 41:00.357
Ariel's taking a shower.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.990
I thought I would just lock up
and go to bed.

41:03.024 --> 41:05.057
Oh, my God,
how long have I been in here?

41:05.090 --> 41:06.257
That's all right;
you look comfortable.

41:06.291 --> 41:07.524
You're allowed.

41:07.558 --> 41:09.823
I'll be back.
I won't let you drown.

41:25.124 --> 41:26.658
WOMAN:
We're very aware
of everything

41:26.690 --> 41:28.224
that's been going on
with the mayor.

41:28.257 --> 41:31.690
We're all aware
of how mercurial he can be.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.757
You've been very deft

41:33.790 --> 41:35.357
the way you've covered for him.

41:35.391 --> 41:36.990
That's my job.

41:37.024 --> 41:38.157
Oh, and you
do it well.

41:38.191 --> 41:42.524
You seem very, um,
at ease on television.

41:42.558 --> 41:43.689
Oh?

41:43.690 --> 41:45.989
Have you ever considered
running for office?

41:45.990 --> 41:47.456
Excuse me?

41:47.457 --> 41:50.823
We'd like to see you go after
a spot on city council.

42:12.524 --> 42:14.090
Oh, let me ask
you something.

42:14.123 --> 42:15.724
How do I do this?

42:15.757 --> 42:16.891
Just ask her.

42:16.924 --> 42:17.991
You got a boyfriend?

42:18.024 --> 42:19.958
Hopefully, a doctor
or a lawyer.

42:19.991 --> 42:21.891
Someone with some standing.

42:24.190 --> 42:25.958
I'm just kidding.

42:27.624 --> 42:29.958
But seriously, is there someone
we should know about?

42:29.991 --> 42:33.357
Whoever they are,
they're going to end up
being very involved.

42:33.358 --> 42:34.424
Please, whomever it might be,

42:34.458 --> 42:36.157
just don't let it be
a civil servant.

42:36.191 --> 42:38.324
All of the union agreements
are coming up in January,

42:38.358 --> 42:39.757
(laughs):
and that's all we need.

42:50.824 --> 42:52.224
I'd do that for you,
if I could.

42:56.551 --> 42:58.334
I'm beginning to think
it's a big lie.

42:59.584 --> 43:02.201
What are you doing here?

43:03.951 --> 43:05.151
But that's crazy.

43:05.784 --> 43:08.217
That's wrong.
You can't be here.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.933
You can't do this.

43:09.934 --> 43:12.000
I have a family,
and you have someplace

43:12.034 --> 43:13.167
you're supposed to be.

43:13.201 --> 43:14.867
Well, I like it here.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.668
I like your house;
it feels good.

43:16.701 --> 43:17.801
I like your kids.

43:17.835 --> 43:20.167
You're not thinking clearly.

43:20.201 --> 43:22.167
You must still be in shock.

43:22.201 --> 43:23.701
And you're leaving
out my husband.

43:23.735 --> 43:25.201
I have a husband.
I have a life.

43:25.234 --> 43:26.867
Really?
(door opens)

43:26.900 --> 43:28.301
Locked and loaded.

43:33.201 --> 43:35.000
Hey, you know what?

43:35.034 --> 43:37.835
Wet becomes you, my darling.

43:37.867 --> 43:39.301
You look good like that.

43:40.568 --> 43:42.468
I may toss you
in that tub every night.

43:43.534 --> 43:45.167
"Wet becomes you"?

43:46.967 --> 43:49.267
This is so unfair.

43:49.301 --> 43:52.368
(chuckles)
What's that?
I say the wrong thing?

43:52.401 --> 43:53.867
You want me to go?

43:53.900 --> 43:55.568
Just say, "Clay,
I need you to go."

43:55.601 --> 43:57.735
JOE:
I can't help it.
You come over here

43:57.768 --> 44:00.867
and look at yourself
in that water,

44:00.900 --> 44:02.867
in the candlelight.

44:02.900 --> 44:05.301
Sorry, baby, it's
bigger than both of us.

44:05.334 --> 44:06.601
Kind of a goofball, huh?

44:06.634 --> 44:08.534
Stop it.

44:08.568 --> 44:09.634
You're seriously
bothered?

44:09.668 --> 44:13.067
Just say, "Clay, I need
you to go."

44:13.101 --> 44:15.468
See, this is it.
This is the kind of stuff.

44:15.501 --> 44:17.301
This is why we were
never meant to be.

44:19.368 --> 44:20.568
What are you talking about?

44:20.601 --> 44:22.234
"Never meant to be"?

44:22.267 --> 44:24.334
Does he know he's got
toothpaste on his mouth?

44:24.368 --> 44:26.768
Does he have any idea
how sad and pathetic

44:26.801 --> 44:28.634
this all is?
Clay, I need you to go!

44:28.668 --> 44:30.668
Clay?

44:32.034 --> 44:33.334
Did you say "Clay"?

44:34.401 --> 44:36.434
As in high school Clay?

44:36.468 --> 44:38.234
Is he here?

44:39.267 --> 44:41.801
Allison?

44:41.835 --> 44:43.401
Hey, Allison!

44:43.434 --> 44:45.501
Allison!

45:40.301 --> 45:42.368
(screaming):
Mommy!

45:42.401 --> 45:44.434
Is he in here?
I don't see him, no.

45:44.468 --> 45:46.000
Then where is he, Allison?

45:46.034 --> 45:47.668
I don't know.
I don't see him, either.

45:47.701 --> 45:49.101
You expect me
to believe that?

45:49.134 --> 45:51.101
BRIDGETTE (screaming):
Mommy!

45:57.867 --> 46:00.201
Hello?

46:00.234 --> 46:01.267
Hey, you still coming over?

46:01.301 --> 46:02.334
How'd the drink thing go?

46:02.368 --> 46:04.601
They just left.
It went great.

46:04.634 --> 46:06.634
It went really great.

46:06.668 --> 46:09.468
But I need to talk
to you about something.

46:09.501 --> 46:11.301
Anything.
What's going on?

46:12.900 --> 46:14.768
Hang on a second, honey,
I'm getting another call.

46:18.967 --> 46:21.801
Baby, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to hold.

46:21.835 --> 46:23.634
I just got a call.

46:23.668 --> 46:25.234
Somebody hit a mansion
in Bear Park.

46:25.267 --> 46:26.634
I don't have all
the details yet,

46:26.668 --> 46:29.934
but, uh, looks like I'm gonna
have to run out there.

46:34.034 --> 46:36.000
Hello?

46:37.368 --> 46:39.000
Oh, yes, I understand.

46:39.034 --> 46:41.000
He's right here.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.501
Manuel?

46:44.534 --> 46:46.900
What are you doing?

46:46.934 --> 46:49.934
There's been another one
of those house things.

46:49.967 --> 46:51.967
Okay, I know.

46:53.368 --> 46:54.768
The light is on, right?

46:54.801 --> 46:56.267
You turned
on the lamp?

46:56.301 --> 46:58.167
The lamp is on?
What are you talking about?

46:58.201 --> 46:59.701
Yes, the light is on.
They're on the phone.

46:59.735 --> 47:02.267
Shh, don't panic. Just tell them
I'll call them back.

47:02.301 --> 47:04.768
What are you talking about
you'll "call them back"?

47:04.801 --> 47:06.067
Lilly...

47:06.101 --> 47:07.967
listen to me.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.634
Don't be alarmed...

47:10.668 --> 47:12.468
but I can't see a damn thing.

47:14.101 --> 47:16.401
(crying)
Shh, Bridgette.

47:16.434 --> 47:19.234
(phone ringing)
Sweetie, it was
just a bad dream.

47:19.267 --> 47:21.701
Sweetie, stop. You're
gonna make yourself sick.

47:23.167 --> 47:25.701
It's Scanlon.

47:25.735 --> 47:26.967
Hello?
Come here.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
SCANLON (on phone):
Allison, it happened again.

47:30.501 --> 47:32.134
They got the man of the house.

47:32.167 --> 47:33.434
He has a golf club.

47:33.468 --> 47:35.301
The Mom...

47:35.334 --> 47:36.468
In the hall, yeah.

47:36.501 --> 47:38.967
What about the baby?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Did they get the baby?

47:41.034 --> 47:43.501
Yeah, they got the baby, too.

47:43.534 --> 47:45.259
How'd you know?

48:00.217 --> 48:01.718
Go to sleep, Joe.

48:01.751 --> 48:03.918
I can't go to sleep.

48:05.751 --> 48:07.751
He's not here.

48:08.751 --> 48:09.918
You don't know that.

48:11.417 --> 48:13.317
I don't see him.
I don't see him anywhere.

48:13.351 --> 48:14.618
I would tell you
if I did.

48:14.651 --> 48:16.551
But you're not
even looking.

48:18.584 --> 48:21.050
I don't see him.

48:21.084 --> 48:23.217
I swear.
Right.

48:23.251 --> 48:25.451
Uh-huh.
What, you don't
believe me?

48:25.484 --> 48:27.985
Allison, the man has
apparently been here

48:28.017 --> 48:29.384
for two whole days.

48:29.417 --> 48:30.751
Now, either you forgot

48:30.784 --> 48:32.718
to mention it or he
can choose when it is

48:32.751 --> 48:34.751
that you see him, and neither
of those two scenarios

48:34.784 --> 48:36.918
makes me particularly
comfortable.

48:36.951 --> 48:38.818
You know, you can
really be an ass.

48:38.851 --> 48:39.951
I didn't do this, Allison.

48:39.985 --> 48:41.417
I'm going to go sleep
in the girls' room.

48:41.451 --> 48:44.050
Go.
Holler if you see a ghost.

48:44.084 --> 48:45.818
Yeah, if you see a ghost,
remember:

48:45.851 --> 48:47.818
you're a married woman.

48:50.618 --> 48:53.251
Hey, "Allibaster."

48:53.284 --> 48:55.217
Your guy's got quite
the temper, huh?

48:55.251 --> 48:56.751
You think <i>he</i> has a temper?

48:56.784 --> 48:58.384
Shh, down, girl.

48:58.417 --> 49:01.584
How dare you--
camp out in my house?!

49:01.618 --> 49:03.584
Toy with my family,
toy with me,

49:03.618 --> 49:05.584
someone you claim to care about?

49:05.618 --> 49:06.751
I hate you.

49:06.784 --> 49:08.818
No, you don't.
Yes,

49:08.851 --> 49:11.251
I do and I need you
to leave my house.

49:11.284 --> 49:13.484
Funny how
things work out.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.284
You know, when we were in
school, I thought you were

49:15.317 --> 49:16.818
the smartest thing
on two legs.

49:16.851 --> 49:19.317
When we were in school,
I thought you were smug.

49:19.351 --> 49:22.551
And vain and selfish
and nice to look at

49:22.584 --> 49:24.050
and maybe, deep down,
had a heart.

49:24.084 --> 49:25.584
I guess I was wrong
about the heart.

49:25.618 --> 49:28.451
You know, he's mistaken
about you in there.

49:28.484 --> 49:30.383
Pissed off becomes you.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.817
Leave my house!

49:31.850 --> 49:33.850
Don't you think I
would, if I could?

49:33.884 --> 49:36.850
Well, maybe you just
have to try harder.

49:36.884 --> 49:39.318
Come on, you can do it.

49:39.351 --> 49:41.518
Find a light
and walk into it.

49:41.551 --> 49:43.351
You think it's just
a coincidence I ended up here,

49:43.384 --> 49:44.884
out of all the places
in all the world?

49:44.917 --> 49:46.518
Your house?

49:46.551 --> 49:49.250
You think it's an
accident you can see me?

49:49.251 --> 49:52.551
Hear me? I don't.

49:52.585 --> 49:55.151
I've been to a lot of places,
I've seen a lot of things.

49:55.184 --> 49:57.484
I don't believe in coincidence.

49:57.518 --> 49:59.017
I'm here for a reason...

49:59.051 --> 50:01.685
like it or not, baby.

50:01.717 --> 50:03.717
I think that
reason is you.

50:05.218 --> 50:07.850
Mommy, I got scared and I
thought I heard voices.

50:09.351 --> 50:12.051
It's just me, sweetie,
talking to myself.

50:12.084 --> 50:13.917
Did you have a bad dream?

50:13.951 --> 50:17.017
Uh... kind of.

50:17.018 --> 50:19.984
Do you want to come in my
bed and sleep with me?

50:20.018 --> 50:21.751
That might make it all better.

50:24.084 --> 50:25.684
If you don't mind.

50:25.717 --> 50:27.118
Okay, just this once.

50:27.151 --> 50:29.018
As long as we don't
make a habit out of it.

50:29.051 --> 50:31.118
(chuckles):
Okay.

50:34.184 --> 50:36.784
(beeping)
MAN:
Mr. Devalos.

50:36.817 --> 50:39.385
I'm going to shine a very bright
light into your eyes.

50:39.417 --> 50:40.651
I need you to tell me
if you see something.

50:40.684 --> 50:42.651
Anything.

50:42.684 --> 50:44.218
DEVALOS:
Uh, yeah.

50:44.251 --> 50:47.184
It's very blurry, but I can see.

50:47.218 --> 50:50.084
I see you and I see the room.

50:50.118 --> 50:51.684
And I can see you, Lilly.

50:51.717 --> 50:54.751
My best guess is
that we're looking
at a severe case

50:54.784 --> 50:56.684
of diabetic retinopathy.

50:56.717 --> 50:58.251
Blood sugar's
off the charts.

50:58.285 --> 51:00.184
You're lucky you
can see at all.

51:00.218 --> 51:01.784
You're lucky
you're conscious.

51:01.817 --> 51:03.051
DEVALOS:
What does this mean?

51:03.084 --> 51:04.717
Is this thing curable?

51:04.751 --> 51:06.051
It means we wait.

51:06.084 --> 51:08.351
Wait for that insulin
we're putting in you

51:08.385 --> 51:10.184
to hopefully start
doing its work.

51:10.218 --> 51:11.851
And wait for the
doctors who really

51:11.884 --> 51:13.018
know their way
around this stuff

51:13.051 --> 51:15.450
to get here, which
may be a little bit.

51:15.484 --> 51:16.918
It is 4:00 in the
morning, you know.

51:16.951 --> 51:18.584
LILLY:
But he's gonna be okay?

51:18.617 --> 51:20.751
We just have to hope the
damage isn't too great.

51:20.784 --> 51:23.717
Mr. Devalos...

51:23.751 --> 51:25.584
when was the last
time you saw a doctor?

51:26.817 --> 51:30.550
DEVALOS (sighing):
I honestly don't know.

51:30.584 --> 51:32.751
I really can't remember.

51:34.417 --> 51:36.984
I'm gonna shut
this light off.

51:37.018 --> 51:40.018
I suggest you
get some rest.

52:38.751 --> 52:41.051
Okay.
Mommy.

52:41.084 --> 52:42.450
I know.

52:42.484 --> 52:44.051
I saw it, too.

52:44.084 --> 52:45.684
It's okay, honey.

52:45.717 --> 52:47.285
It's okay,
it was just a cartoon.

52:47.318 --> 52:49.151
Okay? Shh.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.801
DEVALOS:
Hey.

52:59.401 --> 53:02.001
I can see you.

53:02.034 --> 53:04.434
Hey.

53:04.468 --> 53:06.101
I can see you, too.

53:06.134 --> 53:08.767
You look kind of soft and gauzy,

53:08.800 --> 53:11.734
kind of like an angel.

53:11.767 --> 53:14.700
Kind of like...

53:14.734 --> 53:16.368
we might be in heaven.

53:16.401 --> 53:17.767
We're not dead, are we?

53:17.800 --> 53:19.368
God, I hope not.

53:19.401 --> 53:22.535
I have a bunch of stuff I have
to pick up at the dry cleaners.

53:22.568 --> 53:24.834
If I'm dead,
Joe will never remember

53:24.867 --> 53:26.434
where I keep the tickets.

53:26.468 --> 53:29.934
What did you do?

53:29.967 --> 53:33.034
The dentist, the doctor, flying.

53:35.067 --> 53:36.800
Those are my three big demons.

53:36.834 --> 53:39.468
When I was a teenager,

53:39.501 --> 53:42.401
my... my mother

53:42.434 --> 53:45.101
worked in a department store
refolding merchandise

53:45.134 --> 53:47.468
at night after
everyone had gone home.

53:49.501 --> 53:51.901
She didn't even feel bad.

53:51.934 --> 53:54.034
Just a little pain
under her arm.

53:56.268 --> 53:58.834
Ignored it for the longest time.

53:58.867 --> 54:00.800
Store insisted she see someone.

54:00.834 --> 54:02.834
And then, six weeks later...

54:05.767 --> 54:09.268
I do believe that's
the last time I ever cried.

54:09.301 --> 54:11.301
Got a life's worth of tears out.

54:15.834 --> 54:17.001
You come all this way

54:17.034 --> 54:19.734
just to give me that
swell-looking balloon?

54:21.767 --> 54:24.134
Olga Bankova and her son
were run off the road

54:24.168 --> 54:27.800
by the same people who killed
the Costigan family last week,

54:27.834 --> 54:30.468
slaughtered the Milano family
last night.

54:30.501 --> 54:32.834
And you know this how?

54:32.867 --> 54:35.301
I know.

54:37.001 --> 54:40.834
We're still in the land
of cartoon people, right?

54:40.867 --> 54:43.800
I'd really like to see
where they lived,

54:43.834 --> 54:45.368
this boy and his mother.

54:45.401 --> 54:47.535
We've already had
a detective out there,

54:47.568 --> 54:49.568
but, sure, you're welcome
to take a look.

54:52.568 --> 54:53.635
Hey, hold on a second.

54:53.667 --> 54:55.767
Uh, thought you
were a friend.

54:55.800 --> 54:58.434
Gaze into your crystal ball.

54:58.468 --> 55:00.834
Give a sick man some hope.

55:04.268 --> 55:05.967
It just doesn't work that way.

55:06.001 --> 55:08.201
A lot of times,

55:08.234 --> 55:10.667
the people closest to me...

55:10.700 --> 55:14.268
I didn't even know you were ill.

55:14.301 --> 55:16.468
I do know
that your wife loves you.

55:16.501 --> 55:18.967
We passed
in the hall.

55:19.001 --> 55:21.700
She was going home to clean up,

55:21.734 --> 55:23.501
call relatives.

55:23.535 --> 55:26.301
It just poured off her.

55:26.334 --> 55:28.234
"I love this man.

55:28.268 --> 55:30.967
"I'm so angry at this man.

55:31.001 --> 55:32.168
"I love this man.

55:32.201 --> 55:35.201
I am so angry at this man."

55:44.034 --> 55:46.034
ALLISON:
Thank you.

55:54.635 --> 55:57.501
They smashed their way
through this door.

55:57.535 --> 56:00.001
Who, the cartoon bad guys?

56:00.034 --> 56:01.700
It's an old,
rotted doorjamb,

56:01.734 --> 56:03.934
an old, rotted door.

56:03.967 --> 56:06.401
If she didn't have it locked,
didn't have the chain on it,

56:06.434 --> 56:07.434
you could kick this open,

56:07.468 --> 56:09.501
we'd never even know.

56:16.501 --> 56:18.767
What is it we're
looking for again?

56:18.800 --> 56:22.468
I don't know, a reason why
killers who hit wealthy families

56:22.501 --> 56:24.201
for no reason at all
would also kill

56:24.234 --> 56:26.601
a substitute teacher
and her child.

56:31.984 --> 56:34.984
SCANLON:
Methinks the woman
liked to paint.

56:45.618 --> 56:46.183
Look at this.

56:46.184 --> 56:48.217
It looks like she's trying
to learn how to paint

56:48.251 --> 56:49.785
in the style
of this artist.

56:55.984 --> 56:57.751
Do these look familiar?

56:57.785 --> 57:00.217
Sure. I'd recognize
that squiggle anywhere.

57:00.251 --> 57:01.785
It's after
5:00, Allison.

57:01.818 --> 57:04.151
We've got at least a
two-hour drive back.

57:04.184 --> 57:06.050
Allison?

57:08.050 --> 57:11.718
The food court at the mall?

57:11.751 --> 57:14.017
You can have dinner
anywhere you want,

57:14.050 --> 57:16.751
and you want to have it
at the food court at the mall?

57:16.785 --> 57:19.317
Daddy, if you don't really
want to know, you shouldn't ask.

57:19.351 --> 57:21.317
What's wrong with the
food court at the mall?

57:21.351 --> 57:22.551
They have everything.

57:22.584 --> 57:24.718
They have food from
all over the world.

57:24.751 --> 57:27.618
Okay, the people have spoken.

57:27.651 --> 57:29.251
Let me just get
out of these clothes,

57:29.284 --> 57:31.084
and we'll head out to the mall.

57:31.117 --> 57:33.217
Yippee.

57:50.885 --> 57:51.950
Hello?

58:01.351 --> 58:03.351
She is my wife, you know.

58:06.551 --> 58:08.151
Mine.

58:10.184 --> 58:11.818
I know what you're thinking.

58:11.851 --> 58:14.518
You're thinking,
what am I gonna do, kill you?

58:17.217 --> 58:19.184
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

58:19.217 --> 58:20.818
But I will figure something out.

58:20.851 --> 58:24.718
I am gonna make your death

58:24.751 --> 58:27.718
more miserable than your life.

58:36.217 --> 58:38.017
She's mine.

58:43.217 --> 58:46.217
Hey, Ariel?

58:46.251 --> 58:48.251
Ariel, sweetie,
come here for a second.

58:52.718 --> 58:54.418
Hey, come here.
What are you doing?

58:54.451 --> 58:55.818
I thought you
were changing.

58:55.851 --> 58:58.317
I thought we were
going to the mall.
We are, we are.

58:58.351 --> 58:59.751
Just have a look
around the room.

58:59.785 --> 59:00.851
Okay.

59:00.885 --> 59:02.917
What am I
looking for?

59:02.950 --> 59:04.351
I don't know.
What do you see?

59:04.384 --> 59:07.050
Do you see anything?

59:07.084 --> 59:08.518
What are you
talking about?

59:08.551 --> 59:10.050
I see what you see.

59:10.084 --> 59:11.117
It's your room.

59:11.151 --> 59:13.618
It looks like your
room always looks.

59:13.651 --> 59:14.818
Are you okay?

59:14.851 --> 59:16.084
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just curious.

59:16.117 --> 59:17.785
So...

59:17.818 --> 59:21.151
there's nothing you see in here
that's out of the ordinary?

59:21.184 --> 59:22.351
I don't know.

59:22.384 --> 59:25.251
Did Mommy get a new
bedspread or something?

59:27.251 --> 59:28.785
Huh.

59:31.984 --> 59:33.184
It's the wind, Daddy.

59:37.885 --> 59:39.584
It's just the wind.

59:39.618 --> 59:41.818
Huh.

59:41.851 --> 59:43.117
I'm really hungry.

59:43.151 --> 59:44.751
We're all
really hungry.

59:44.785 --> 59:45.751
Yes, me, too.

59:45.785 --> 59:47.117
Come on.

59:47.151 --> 59:50.151
I'll change later.
Let's get out of here.

59:50.184 --> 59:51.551
Let's go.

01:00:18.868 --> 01:00:21.034
Look at this.
Together again.

01:00:26.935 --> 01:00:28.901
If we're here,
who's running the city?

01:00:31.035 --> 01:00:33.267
Could you have picked
a more out of the way place?

01:00:33.301 --> 01:00:35.868
Yeah, pretty
obscure, huh?

01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:38.584
May I start you off
with something to drink?

01:00:38.618 --> 01:00:40.050
You on the clock?

01:00:40.084 --> 01:00:41.618
I'll have a scotch
and soda.

01:00:41.651 --> 01:00:45.351
The lady will have
a dirty martini.

01:00:45.384 --> 01:00:47.818
So, when last we spoke, uh...

01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:49.151
DINOVI:
When last we spoke...

01:00:49.717 --> 01:00:51.517
Where do I start?

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:54.218
Drinks... Lady from
the third district...

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:55.650
It went great.

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:57.751
It's been 24 hours, and
I still don't believe it.

01:00:57.784 --> 01:00:58.784
Believe what?

01:01:00.817 --> 01:01:02.951
They want me to run
for city council.

01:01:06.151 --> 01:01:07.351
(exhales)
I should cancel the cocktails

01:01:07.385 --> 01:01:08.784
and get us
a bottle of champagne.

01:01:08.817 --> 01:01:10.018
Don't do that.
I've been dreaming

01:01:10.051 --> 01:01:11.118
about a martini all day.

01:01:11.151 --> 01:01:12.418
A martini? Not me?

01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:13.751
A martini and you.

01:01:13.784 --> 01:01:15.418
I was just

01:01:15.451 --> 01:01:17.951
so completely
taken by surprise.

01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:19.751
Then they started hitting
me with questions.

01:01:19.784 --> 01:01:21.984
Questions?

01:01:22.018 --> 01:01:24.018
"Where were you born?
Are you a native?

01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:25.251
"Do you belong
to any clubs?

01:01:25.284 --> 01:01:26.284
Are you involved
with anyone?"

01:01:26.318 --> 01:01:27.584
You fess up?

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.617
I told them the truth.

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.550
That, for all intents
and purposes, I'm...

01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:33.284
You're at my house
one or two nights a week.

01:01:33.318 --> 01:01:35.084
Well, no, I didn't
tell them that.

01:01:35.118 --> 01:01:37.183
I don't think a woman
running for office

01:01:37.184 --> 01:01:38.918
should be bragging about
making the walk of shame

01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:41.184
from her lover's apartment to
her car at 6:30 in the morning,

01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:44.051
praying that nobody sees her.

01:01:44.085 --> 01:01:45.651
Yeah, well...

01:01:47.317 --> 01:01:49.316
...I want to talk to you
about that.

01:01:49.317 --> 01:01:51.084
No, it's okay.

01:01:51.117 --> 01:01:52.451
I realized something.

01:01:52.484 --> 01:01:54.984
I like what we have,
the way we have it.

01:01:57.184 --> 01:01:59.250
I wasn't sure
at first.

01:01:59.251 --> 01:02:01.684
Never been with someone who
didn't want to come home with me

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.484
to my folks at
Christmas, but...

01:02:03.517 --> 01:02:04.484
but it's okay.

01:02:04.517 --> 01:02:05.717
It's actually good.

01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:08.751
One of the things these
people said to me was,

01:02:08.784 --> 01:02:10.517
I guess a lot of the
union agreements--

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.517
police, fire, teachers--
they're all coming up next year.

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:18.717
I mean, the last thing they
wanted to hear was that I'm--

01:02:18.751 --> 01:02:22.984
whatever you call this thing we
have-- with a civil servant.

01:02:27.884 --> 01:02:29.550
Is that what I am,
a civil servant?

01:02:29.584 --> 01:02:31.285
What? No.

01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:32.717
That's their word.

01:02:32.751 --> 01:02:33.751
It's really just about...

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.018
I get the point.

01:02:35.635 --> 01:02:37.201
They don't want you
sleeping with the help.

01:02:37.234 --> 01:02:39.134
It's really just about
these negotiations.

01:02:39.167 --> 01:02:40.434
What did you say?

01:02:40.468 --> 01:02:43.317
(cell phone ringing)
There was nothing to say.

01:02:48.584 --> 01:02:49.617
Got it.

01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:51.984
I'll see you there.

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:54.400
Wait a second.

01:02:54.401 --> 01:02:55.635
I thought we were having dinner.

01:02:55.668 --> 01:02:56.817
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

01:02:56.818 --> 01:02:58.451
I'm just a civil servant.

01:02:58.484 --> 01:03:00.551
I get a call, I go to work.

01:03:00.584 --> 01:03:02.451
Lee...
What?

01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:06.567
Hey, some people just got shot
to death in Hasbrook Heights.

01:03:06.568 --> 01:03:07.683
The mayor's back in town,

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.285
so you're not
getting the call,

01:03:09.317 --> 01:03:10.717
but I'm just a working guy.

01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:12.717
Enjoy your drink; it's paid for.

01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.851
Are you hurt?

01:03:14.884 --> 01:03:17.884
You don't even let me keep
a toothbrush at your place

01:03:17.918 --> 01:03:19.884
and you're hurt?!

01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:21.384
I'm not hurt.

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:22.384
I'm thrilled for you.

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:24.484
You have my vote.

01:03:24.517 --> 01:03:26.884
But I got to go.

01:03:31.317 --> 01:03:33.317
Will the gentleman
be returning?

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.350
It's Scanlon.
He says it's important.

01:03:42.384 --> 01:03:45.751
You didn't have another
bad dream, did you?

01:03:48.651 --> 01:03:50.384
Hello?

01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:53.018
SCANLON:
You want the good news, the bad
news or the very bad news?

01:03:53.051 --> 01:03:54.818
Just tell me
what's going on.

01:03:54.851 --> 01:03:57.317
(over phone):
Another home invasion.

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.918
Only this time, the homeowner
was packing heat.

01:03:59.951 --> 01:04:01.851
Killed all three of them.

01:04:01.884 --> 01:04:03.084
I think it's over, Allison.

01:04:03.118 --> 01:04:04.784
I think it's all over.

01:04:04.818 --> 01:04:06.285
Okay.

01:04:06.317 --> 01:04:08.751
What about the very bad news?

01:04:08.784 --> 01:04:10.484
Your boss is still
in the hospital.

01:04:10.517 --> 01:04:12.350
I need you to get dressed
and come downtown

01:04:12.384 --> 01:04:14.084
and help me interrogate
the solid citizen

01:04:14.118 --> 01:04:15.450
who gunned down
these three bastards.

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:16.784
What is it, Mommy?

01:04:16.818 --> 01:04:18.218
Who's on the phone?

01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:19.584
Hold on.

01:04:19.617 --> 01:04:20.584
It's the police, honey.

01:04:20.617 --> 01:04:22.350
They got the bad Monkeyheads.

01:04:22.384 --> 01:04:24.784
They're not gonna bother
anybody anymore.

01:04:24.818 --> 01:04:27.818
SCANLON:
Spell your name
for me, please.

01:04:27.851 --> 01:04:29.350
Alan Gardner.

01:04:29.384 --> 01:04:31.851
G-A-R-D-N-E-R.

01:04:31.884 --> 01:04:33.350
And I should warn you,

01:04:33.384 --> 01:04:34.616
I don't think
I'm actually sick, but I...

01:04:34.617 --> 01:04:35.166
We know.

01:04:35.167 --> 01:04:37.234
We know that you've been through
a lot tonight.

01:04:37.717 --> 01:04:40.151
The officer mentioned
that you've been throwing up.

01:04:42.885 --> 01:04:44.700
I think it's just nerves.

01:04:44.701 --> 01:04:46.534
I'm actually feeling
a little better right now.

01:04:48.567 --> 01:04:50.301
You want to tell
us what happened?

01:04:50.335 --> 01:04:52.667
What happened...

01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:55.201
I don't know...
I mean, I guess,

01:04:55.235 --> 01:04:58.335
like everybody with a big
house, I've been on edge.

01:04:58.367 --> 01:05:00.467
It was the staff's
night off.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.500
I had been reading.

01:05:01.534 --> 01:05:04.068
Fell asleep in bed.

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.168
Then the alarm went off.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:07.101
What did you do?

01:05:07.134 --> 01:05:09.001
I ran into the closet.

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:11.767
It's like a little
vault, actually--

01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:14.134
fireproof.

01:05:14.168 --> 01:05:17.601
I keep some papers there,
antiquities, canvases.

01:05:17.634 --> 01:05:19.335
I'm an art dealer.

01:05:19.367 --> 01:05:22.001
And I thought, well, I'll just
lock the door and stay in here.

01:05:22.034 --> 01:05:23.634
I don't think they can
shoot through it.

01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:24.968
Like a panic room.

01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:25.968
Yeah.

01:05:26.001 --> 01:05:26.968
But small.

01:05:27.001 --> 01:05:28.068
And there's monitors in there.

01:05:28.101 --> 01:05:30.301
So I can see them moving
through the house.

01:05:30.335 --> 01:05:32.201
And I know the police
are trying to call.

01:05:32.235 --> 01:05:35.500
And I thought for a moment,

01:05:35.534 --> 01:05:38.268
I think I might actually
live through this thing.

01:05:42.201 --> 01:05:44.168
Then they shot Keezey.

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:51.201
That little schnauzer
is the only family I have.

01:05:54.001 --> 01:05:56.701
I mean, you go through
the housebreaking,

01:05:56.734 --> 01:06:00.767
the bladder infections,
the doggie tumors,

01:06:00.801 --> 01:06:02.801
and you just never imagine...

01:06:05.701 --> 01:06:07.168
Even on the
black-and-white monitor,

01:06:07.201 --> 01:06:09.367
I can see him lying there,

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.801
the blood coming
out of his body.

01:06:14.734 --> 01:06:18.101
That's when I saw the gun...

01:06:18.134 --> 01:06:21.567
the rifle, box of ammo...

01:06:21.601 --> 01:06:23.301
I got it, like,
six years ago,

01:06:23.335 --> 01:06:26.068
to go skeet shooting with
a client, which I hated.

01:06:26.101 --> 01:06:28.734
So much noise, and it...

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:30.734
hurt my shoulder.

01:06:35.235 --> 01:06:37.101
Then I went out
into the hall.

01:06:39.134 --> 01:06:41.567
The way the stairs work,
you can't see into the hall

01:06:41.601 --> 01:06:44.101
unless you're at the top.

01:06:46.134 --> 01:06:48.367
And I just waited.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.601
(gunshots)

01:07:01.335 --> 01:07:02.301
(gently):
Mr. Gardner?

01:07:02.335 --> 01:07:05.834
I am a civilized person.

01:07:05.868 --> 01:07:07.567
I know they were killers.

01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:09.068
They killed my Keezey.

01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:12.767
But I just never imagined,
in the course of my life,

01:07:12.801 --> 01:07:15.901
that I would actually
kill another man.

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.434
Three other men.

01:07:22.567 --> 01:07:25.001
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:07:38.134 --> 01:07:41.367
Look who's returning
to the marital bed.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.001
What is it, like,
4:00 in the morning?

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.101
It's nice of you to
make an appearance.

01:07:49.134 --> 01:07:50.467
It's, like, 5:00.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.801
Or five-oh-s...

01:07:53.868 --> 01:07:55.268
...seven.

01:08:04.101 --> 01:08:06.968
I think it's really over.

01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:10.001
The home invaders are dead.

01:08:10.034 --> 01:08:13.001
This meek little
art dealer shot them

01:08:13.034 --> 01:08:17.033
'cause they killed his dog.

01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:20.100
Bridgette will be relieved.

01:08:20.134 --> 01:08:23.268
No more bad dreams.

01:08:23.301 --> 01:08:26.301
It's funny the way
stuff happens.

01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:33.901
I think your boyfriend's
gone, by the way.

01:08:33.934 --> 01:08:35.500
ALLISON:
Oh, yeah?

01:08:35.533 --> 01:08:37.399
JOE:
We had a chat.

01:08:37.434 --> 01:08:39.868
I mean, I had a chat.

01:08:39.901 --> 01:08:42.201
And I think
he heard it,

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:44.567
because I haven't felt
any cold breezes,

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.567
and he hasn't
been seen since.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.367
What do you mean?

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:51.100
Seen by who?
Who could see him?

01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:52.201
He's a ghost.

01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:54.600
I had Ariel take a
little look for him.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:57.234
I mean, she didn't know

01:08:57.268 --> 01:08:58.734
that that's who she
was looking for.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.734
You did not.
Yes...

01:09:04.301 --> 01:09:06.600
I certainly did.

01:09:06.634 --> 01:09:09.934
Did you think I was just gonna
give you up without a fight?

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.399
I love you with
all my heart.

01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:57.068
You got it now?

01:09:57.101 --> 01:09:59.134
You got it figured out?
'Cause I got to go.

01:10:06.534 --> 01:10:07.734
SCANLON:
Wow, what are you doing here?

01:10:07.767 --> 01:10:09.367
Aren't you the lady
who was with me

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.068
till almost 4:30 this morning?

01:10:11.101 --> 01:10:12.634
Shouldn't you be
at home sleeping?

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:15.634
I tried sleeping.

01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:17.434
I kept dreaming.

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:19.467
What about you?
Why aren't you home sleeping?

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.567
I don't know.

01:10:20.601 --> 01:10:22.367
Phone kept ringing.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.667
You wanted to see me.
Is something up?

01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:27.168
It's like I said,
I keep having dreams.

01:10:27.201 --> 01:10:29.335
Yeah? So?

01:10:29.367 --> 01:10:33.201
Isn't that kind of like Einstein
always having brainstorms?

01:10:33.235 --> 01:10:34.235
You recognize this?

01:10:34.268 --> 01:10:35.268
Thought you said
you would

01:10:35.301 --> 01:10:36.500
recognize this
squiggle anywhere.

01:10:36.534 --> 01:10:39.068
It's that painting Devalos
told us was so valuable,

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.533
that was hanging
at the first house.

01:10:41.534 --> 01:10:43.634
Okay.
Remember

01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:46.534
those little paintings at Olga's
house I was looking at--

01:10:46.567 --> 01:10:47.833
I told you they reminded me
of something?

01:10:47.834 --> 01:10:50.401
This is the painting
they remind me of.

01:10:50.435 --> 01:10:52.801
I'm glad we, uh,
solved that mystery.
I think she was

01:10:52.834 --> 01:10:55.268
trying to learn how to paint
in the style of this painter.

01:10:55.301 --> 01:10:59.335
I think she was trying to learn
to paint this painting.

01:10:59.368 --> 01:11:01.134
You think they killed her
for that?

01:11:01.168 --> 01:11:02.734
How does that explain
the other killings?

01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:05.634
How does that explain the home
invasions in two other states?

01:11:05.667 --> 01:11:08.368
To be honest, I don't know.
I just...

01:11:08.401 --> 01:11:11.301
Both those houses are still
crime scenes, right?

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:13.467
Could someone possibly

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.567
just bring me this painting?

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.168
Maybe all the little ones
I was looking at

01:11:18.201 --> 01:11:19.600
at Olga's house?
Allison, is it possible

01:11:19.634 --> 01:11:21.934
that in all the hubbub last
night, that you missed the part

01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:23.467
where the home invaders
were shot to death?

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.801
No, I heard that.

01:11:24.834 --> 01:11:26.701
Did you miss the part
where I said
(phone rings)

01:11:26.734 --> 01:11:28.801
I was still having
dreams about it all?

01:11:32.068 --> 01:11:33.201
So what do you think?

01:11:35.734 --> 01:11:37.717
I think someone's in a mood.

01:11:37.718 --> 01:11:39.284
Sorry.

01:11:39.317 --> 01:11:42.584
A friend of mine who was
visiting left suddenly.

01:11:42.618 --> 01:11:44.117
I guess...

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:47.050
I guess I wanted to say good-bye
more than I realized.

01:11:47.084 --> 01:11:49.284
Yeah, good-byes are
a bitch, aren't they.

01:11:49.317 --> 01:11:50.484
WOMAN:
 <i>How's your vision?</i>

01:11:50.518 --> 01:11:51.484
It's good.

01:11:51.518 --> 01:11:52.451
I can see perfectly.

01:11:52.484 --> 01:11:53.784
I feel good, too.

01:11:53.818 --> 01:11:55.518
Frankly, Doctor, I feel ready
to get out of here.

01:11:55.551 --> 01:11:56.818
Ready to get back to work.

01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:58.684
Well, that's what's going
to kill you, you know.

01:11:58.718 --> 01:11:59.818
How good you feel.

01:11:59.851 --> 01:12:03.518
You have diabetes,
Mr. District Attorney.

01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:05.616
I think that you've probably
had it for years,

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:06.717
but you just didn't know.

01:12:06.751 --> 01:12:08.550
It's a sneaky little bastard.

01:12:08.584 --> 01:12:10.184
If you're not checking for it,

01:12:10.218 --> 01:12:12.651
it doesn't let you know it's
there until it's good and ready

01:12:12.684 --> 01:12:14.651
to give you a stroke
or a heart attack,

01:12:15.134 --> 01:12:16.867
make you impotent
or strike you blind.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.334
Are you trying to frighten me?

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.134
No, I am trying
to warn you.

01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:23.201
Now, I can see you
every three months.

01:12:23.234 --> 01:12:24.334
We can monitor this thing.

01:12:24.368 --> 01:12:26.601
I can teach you how to get
on top of it.

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.668
Or I can see you
in a couple of years.

01:12:28.701 --> 01:12:31.534
Now, if they manage to keep
you alive until you get

01:12:31.568 --> 01:12:33.301
to the hospital,
well, then we can

01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:36.067
 chat about how high on your leg
we need to amputate

01:12:36.101 --> 01:12:37.768
or maybe
where the best Braille

01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:39.967
classes are.

01:12:53.601 --> 01:12:55.067
Okay, so what
does this prove?

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:57.134
You know, I don't know anything
about this stuff, Allison.

01:12:57.167 --> 01:12:58.601
Yeah, I know. Me neither.

01:12:58.634 --> 01:13:00.867
But I know someone who does.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.501
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

01:13:02.534 --> 01:13:03.668
I'm heading out to Carefree.

01:13:03.701 --> 01:13:05.368
Paying a visit to Alan Gardner.

01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:08.368
That gallery owner who shot
those three home invaders.

01:13:08.401 --> 01:13:09.735
Are you okay to drive?

01:13:09.768 --> 01:13:12.234
What'd you get,
about 15 minutes sleep?

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:13.801
No, I'm fine.

01:13:13.835 --> 01:13:15.234
I'm not going to be there long.

01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:17.134
I've just have a couple
paintings in the car

01:13:17.167 --> 01:13:19.234
I asked him to take a look at.

01:13:19.267 --> 01:13:21.967
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.601
Hmm? Sure.

01:13:23.634 --> 01:13:25.101
What did you say to him?

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.735
What are you talking about?

01:13:26.768 --> 01:13:28.735
To Clay. Last night.

01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:34.167
You know what?

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.101
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
It was silly.

01:13:36.134 --> 01:13:37.867
I'm sure that
there was nobody there.

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.501
Okay. But what did you say
to him?

01:13:45.668 --> 01:13:47.634
Hello?

01:13:48.835 --> 01:13:51.000
CLAY:
He said, "She's mine."

01:13:51.034 --> 01:13:54.900
He said everything
you'd want him to say.

01:13:54.934 --> 01:13:57.900
He said everything
you'd hoped he'd say,

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.534
if some crazy numbskull
showed up on your doorstep

01:14:00.568 --> 01:14:03.568
with the idea that maybe
he could have you back.

01:14:11.434 --> 01:14:13.434
Sorry. I-I lost you.

01:14:13.468 --> 01:14:17.534
Yeah, well, um, I don't know
what to tell you.

01:14:17.568 --> 01:14:20.234
I don't know, exactly,

01:14:20.267 --> 01:14:22.701
what I said, and I really
don't think it matters.

01:14:22.735 --> 01:14:24.934
You're right.
It doesn't matter.

01:14:24.967 --> 01:14:27.900
I mean, I don't know what I was
getting so worked up about.

01:14:29.101 --> 01:14:32.900
After all... I'm here.

01:14:32.934 --> 01:14:35.301
Till death do us part.

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:36.701
Yes.

01:14:36.735 --> 01:14:39.534
And who knows.
Maybe longer.

01:14:40.835 --> 01:14:42.234
I'll see you when I get home.

01:14:42.267 --> 01:14:45.067
I will see <i>you</i>
when you get home.

01:14:51.601 --> 01:14:53.368
He's a good man.

01:14:55.434 --> 01:14:57.368
I know.

01:14:57.401 --> 01:14:59.967
I was wrong
about why I'm here.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.668
And you were right.

01:15:02.701 --> 01:15:05.634
And I am smug, vain, selfish...

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.334
even in death.

01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:10.934
None of this has anything
to do with me.

01:15:10.967 --> 01:15:13.568
I finally figured that out
last night.

01:15:13.601 --> 01:15:16.334
I'm not here to woo you.

01:15:16.368 --> 01:15:18.934
I'm here to help you.

01:15:18.967 --> 01:15:21.167
To tell you something

01:15:21.201 --> 01:15:23.668
that you otherwise
wouldn't know.

01:15:23.701 --> 01:15:26.267
To redeem myself.

01:15:27.835 --> 01:15:32.934
And then, Allison,
I think I'll be on my way.

01:15:32.967 --> 01:15:36.468
You sent me that dream
last night, didn't you?

01:15:36.501 --> 01:15:37.501
The one with

01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:39.835
the cartoon?

01:15:39.867 --> 01:15:42.401
I know where you're going.

01:15:42.434 --> 01:15:44.034
And I know what you're
about to do.

01:15:44.067 --> 01:15:45.768
And I know how it all ends up.

01:15:45.801 --> 01:15:48.934
But I need to get you
to do something first.

01:16:01.634 --> 01:16:03.767
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

01:16:03.801 --> 01:16:05.101
Mr. District Attorney,

01:16:05.134 --> 01:16:06.901
I'd like to introduce
you to Alan Gardner.

01:16:06.934 --> 01:16:08.467
The gentleman who
single-handedly stopped

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.767
those three ruthless
home invaders.

01:16:09.801 --> 01:16:11.034
This is an honor,

01:16:11.068 --> 01:16:13.001
sir.
No, it's an honor
meeting you, sir.

01:16:13.034 --> 01:16:14.301
Please.

01:16:14.335 --> 01:16:17.100
I apologize for not being made
available to you sooner.

01:16:17.101 --> 01:16:18.600
I was a bit
under the weather.

01:16:18.634 --> 01:16:21.068
But I just wanted you to know
that this office stands ready

01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:23.168
to help you navigate whatever
legal hurdles your

01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:24.334
extraordinarily brave actions

01:16:24.368 --> 01:16:25.834
may have created
for you.

01:16:25.867 --> 01:16:27.567
Oh.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.717
Should I have brought

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:30.851
my lawyer?

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:32.618
Both the detective

01:16:32.651 --> 01:16:33.885
and Mrs. Dubois,
the other night,

01:16:33.918 --> 01:16:35.184
seemed to indicate
that... that...

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:36.518
That shooting
three people to death

01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:37.918
to protect one's own life

01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:40.251
is a perfectly justifiable
course of action? Absolutely.

01:16:40.284 --> 01:16:42.551
So long as you can prove
that you were in mortal

01:16:42.584 --> 01:16:45.451
danger, you have nothing to fear
from the justice system.

01:16:45.484 --> 01:16:48.718
Well, is there any doubt
about that?

01:16:48.751 --> 01:16:50.184
Doubts? No.

01:16:50.217 --> 01:16:52.017
No doubts, but questions.

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:53.584
There are always questions.

01:16:53.618 --> 01:16:55.451
There's quite a lot

01:16:55.484 --> 01:16:57.484
of valuable art in your
home, isn't there, sir.

01:16:57.518 --> 01:16:58.885
I own two art galleries.

01:16:58.918 --> 01:17:00.651
Of course there's art
in my home.

01:17:00.684 --> 01:17:02.985
You may have heard,
in addition to your home,

01:17:03.017 --> 01:17:05.918
and the two others in the
Phoenix area, two others

01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:08.484
in the Southwest were also hit.
Guess what they all had

01:17:08.518 --> 01:17:10.317
in common?
Every family that was

01:17:10.351 --> 01:17:12.451
targeted, owned at least
one major work of art.

01:17:12.484 --> 01:17:14.651
But I-I don't understand.

01:17:14.684 --> 01:17:16.918
I thought I read that
nothing had been taken from

01:17:16.951 --> 01:17:18.451
the homes.

01:17:18.484 --> 01:17:21.050
The papers never mentioned
anything about art being stolen.

01:17:21.084 --> 01:17:22.985
And it appears that none had,
but then...

01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:24.618
Mrs. Dubois here
developed a theory.

01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:27.551
Well, what if you could find
someone who could paint

01:17:27.584 --> 01:17:30.451
near-perfect copies
of modern masterpieces?

01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:32.851
You go into a home.

01:17:32.885 --> 01:17:35.217
You massacre everyone
who lives there.

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:38.317
You replace the authentic
painting with the fake.

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:42.618
Then while everyone is consumed
with the grief and horror

01:17:42.651 --> 01:17:45.684
you quietly sell the priceless
originals to wealthy collectors

01:17:45.718 --> 01:17:46.918
in the Middle East and Asia.

01:17:46.951 --> 01:17:49.084
Wow.

01:17:49.117 --> 01:17:51.784
You think that's
what's been going on?

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.267
Well, that's the reason

01:17:54.268 --> 01:17:56.383
I brought that painting to you
yesterday.

01:17:56.384 --> 01:17:59.450
It came from the Costigan home
after the massacre.

01:17:59.484 --> 01:18:01.617
I was really hoping
to get your expert opinion

01:18:01.651 --> 01:18:03.384
as to its authenticity.

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:04.818
Well, I'll sign anything.

01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:06.984
And happily testify under oath,
the painting you showed me,

01:18:07.018 --> 01:18:09.151
the one you said came
from the Costigan home,

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.417
that's absolutely an original
Armand Vartanian.

01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:14.450
Easily worth at least
a million dollars.

01:18:14.484 --> 01:18:17.317
Maybe twice that, depending
on the appetite of the buyer.

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:19.517
So much for your theory.

01:18:19.551 --> 01:18:22.251
So you would be
willing to sign

01:18:22.285 --> 01:18:23.517
a sworn statement

01:18:23.551 --> 01:18:26.317
vouching for the painting's
authenticity?

01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:28.584
Well, I'd have no choice.

01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:39.317
Sorry about that.

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:41.285
Mm.
I appreciate this.

01:18:42.534 --> 01:18:45.735
And let me present you
with this.

01:18:45.767 --> 01:18:47.301
And this is?
That...

01:18:47.334 --> 01:18:49.800
that's a search warrant.

01:18:49.834 --> 01:18:53.434
Actually, the detectives should
be arriving at your house

01:18:53.468 --> 01:18:54.701
right about now.

01:18:54.735 --> 01:18:56.334
To look for what?

01:18:56.368 --> 01:18:59.534
That painting
that I brought you yesterday--

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:02.101
an old friend suggested,
before I gave it to you,

01:19:02.134 --> 01:19:04.167
that I mark it in some way.

01:19:04.201 --> 01:19:06.767
So, on the back,
where it would do no damage,

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.468
I wrote the initials, "C.B."

01:19:08.501 --> 01:19:10.434
in indelible marker.

01:19:10.468 --> 01:19:13.167
That is the painting
that you gave back to me.

01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:18.735
And, yes, it's the real
actual painting.

01:19:18.767 --> 01:19:21.534
But it's not the painting
I brought to your house.

01:19:28.767 --> 01:19:30.767
No initials.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.701
The painting

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:35.867
I brought to your house was the
one you had Olga Bankova paint.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.433
What are you suggesting?

01:19:39.434 --> 01:19:41.968
What are...
What are you talking about?

01:19:42.001 --> 01:19:43.001
Those home invaders

01:19:43.035 --> 01:19:45.167
worked for you,
Mr. Gardner.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.367
So did Olga.

01:19:46.401 --> 01:19:48.167
Although we're fairly
certain she had

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.568
no idea what she vas involved
in until it was too late.

01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:52.701
When you realized I was going
to pay you a visit,

01:19:52.734 --> 01:19:54.334
you thought I might be
on to something.

01:19:54.367 --> 01:19:56.234
So you gave me
the authentic painting

01:19:56.267 --> 01:19:57.634
to throw me off the scent.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:59.467
This is preposterous.

01:19:59.501 --> 01:20:00.901
DEVALOS:
Really?

01:20:00.935 --> 01:20:04.200
What about the part where you
suggested to your hired killers

01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:06.734
that you needed them
to hit one more home-- yours.

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.234
But, unlike everyone else,

01:20:08.267 --> 01:20:10.267
you weren't surprised when they
showed up-- you were waiting.

01:20:13.968 --> 01:20:14.968
You can't prove that.

01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:16.701
Oh, I think we can.

01:20:16.734 --> 01:20:17.968
What was your story--

01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:19.501
waiting at the top
of the stairs?

01:20:19.534 --> 01:20:21.668
We think maybe you were
hiding at the bottom.

01:20:21.701 --> 01:20:23.834
DEVALOS:
According to ballistics,

01:20:23.868 --> 01:20:25.501
you shot those men in the back.

01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:27.668
Your dog, too.

01:20:27.701 --> 01:20:29.834
Now, if you'll

01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:32.434
excuse us, I need to give myself
a little insulin shot

01:20:32.467 --> 01:20:33.868
and I'd love a word with you.

01:20:33.901 --> 01:20:35.968
Detective, read this
man his rights.

01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:39.067
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.868
Anything you say
can and will be

01:20:40.901 --> 01:20:42.534
(in distance):
used against you
in a court of law.

01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:47.301
Nice work, Allison.
I mean that.

01:20:47.334 --> 01:20:49.200
I'd like to think
if I'd been feeling better

01:20:49.234 --> 01:20:51.501
I might have listened
more and sooner.

01:20:51.534 --> 01:20:53.701
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

01:20:53.734 --> 01:20:56.035
It wasn't just me;
I had a lot of help.

01:20:56.067 --> 01:20:57.067
Yeah, I know,
your daughter.

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.067
The cartoons.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.035
Yeah, and an old friend.

01:21:00.067 --> 01:21:02.668
Well, thank him for me, too.

01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:05.935
Yeah, well, if I see him,
I will.

01:21:08.301 --> 01:21:11.668
ALLISON:
 <i>Some say sleep is the death</i>
 <i>of each day's life.</i>

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:15.200
 <i>But I say sleep is the gateway</i>
 <i>to our dreams.</i>

01:21:15.234 --> 01:21:19.001
 <i>And our dreams are the map</i>
 <i>of our humanity.</i>

01:21:20.067 --> 01:21:22.167
 <i>Ever watch a child sleep?</i>

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.768
 <i>They almost always smile.</i>

01:21:24.801 --> 01:21:27.801
 <i>They know what's coming.</i>

01:21:27.834 --> 01:21:29.334
 <i>And adults?</i>

01:21:29.367 --> 01:21:32.868
 <i>Ever notice how we try to tidy</i>
 <i>up our lives just before bed?</i>

01:21:36.901 --> 01:21:38.801
Did you take your pills?

01:21:40.935 --> 01:21:42.768
Check your sugar?

01:21:48.367 --> 01:21:51.935
You die on me, I'll
never forgive you.

01:21:51.968 --> 01:21:54.001
Don't worry.

01:21:55.634 --> 01:21:57.734
I'm not going anywhere.

01:22:03.035 --> 01:22:04.568
 <i>Or what a disappointment it is</i>

01:22:04.601 --> 01:22:06.301
 <i>when we're lurched out</i>
 <i>of our sleep,</i>

01:22:06.334 --> 01:22:09.401
(phone rings)
 <i>or our dreams,</i>
 <i>by something unexpected.</i>

01:22:13.001 --> 01:22:14.801
Scanlon.

01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:16.768
Hi.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.901
Who is it?
Is it work?

01:22:21.935 --> 01:22:23.801
Uh...
Want me to go?

01:22:23.834 --> 01:22:25.834
No. It's okay.

01:22:25.868 --> 01:22:27.234
It's nothing. Wrong number.

01:22:46.868 --> 01:22:48.868
Hey, Al.

01:22:51.134 --> 01:22:53.467
Allibaster.

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.501
You know what I heard?

01:22:55.534 --> 01:22:59.035
That if I want it bad enough...

01:22:59.067 --> 01:23:01.501
if I try hard enough...

01:23:01.534 --> 01:23:05.067
sometimes, someone like me...

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.734
can actually be felt...

01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:11.001
by someone like you.

01:23:11.035 --> 01:23:14.467
 <i>A great man once said,</i>

01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:16.768
 <i>"If a little dreaming</i>
 <i>is dangerous,</i>

01:23:16.801 --> 01:23:19.701
 <i>"the cure for it</i>
 <i>is not to dream less...</i>

01:23:19.734 --> 01:23:23.067
 <i>but to dream more."</i>

01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:29.367
Did you think I was just going
to give up

01:23:29.401 --> 01:23:32.334
and let you dream this dream
without a fight?

01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:38.518
 <i>Dream all the time.</i>

01:23:38.551 --> 01:23:41.717
 <i>Yeah, I'm for that.</i>
