00:06.040 --> 00:10.378
ANNOUNCER: Legion.
All new, Mondays at 10:00 on FX.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.481

00:13.514 --> 00:15.883
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.500
MAN:
We're recording.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.402
MS. FORD:
It's Tuesday, May 1.

00:34.435 --> 00:38.339
I'm here with Angel,
hometown the Bronx.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.241
Congratulations, Angel.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.510
We had hundreds of applicants,

00:42.543 --> 00:45.179
and only five made it through
to this final round.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.014
That's quite the feat.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.919
Why do you deserve
to be the Fresh Face of 1990?

00:51.952 --> 00:53.787
I don't know. (chuckles)

00:57.091 --> 01:00.027
'Cause I'm a natural beauty.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.431
And you don't got to beat my mug
for me to be camera ready.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.698
"Beat my mug"?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.535
Yeah. You know.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.770
-Oh, vogue.
-Mm-hmm.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.539
-That's quite on trend.
-Like that.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.241
That's all my clients
are talking about.

01:13.274 --> 01:17.711
But what else can you offer
as a Fresh Face?

01:17.745 --> 01:20.614
My heart.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.083
Um, when a friend
is having a hard time,

01:23.117 --> 01:24.918
they call me.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.388
-And I give pretty good advice.
-(woman chuckles)

01:27.421 --> 01:30.291
Well, that's all
the questions I have.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.092
Thank you for your time.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.561
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.229
Hold on.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.666
You didn't even ask me why I
want to be a Fresh Face of 1990.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.603
(camera whirs)

01:42.636 --> 01:45.239
When was the last time
you've seen somebody

01:45.273 --> 01:48.276
that looked like me
be the face of a campaign?

01:48.309 --> 01:50.811
I know I'm not as polished
as these other girls.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.314
But that don't mean
that I want this any less.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.483
I grew up in a home
where I was told

01:55.516 --> 01:57.117
that I would never
amount to anything.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.323
For a long time...

02:02.356 --> 02:04.258
I believed it.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.460
Sometimes I still do.

02:06.494 --> 02:11.332
And I want to be an example
to... to everybody...

02:13.334 --> 02:15.703
...that's told
that they're worthless.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.474
That they can make something
of themselves.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.446
Help me prove them wrong,
Ms. Ford.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.048
Pick me.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.457
("My Prerogative"
by Bobby Brown playing)

02:36.490 --> 02:38.792
Oh, hey, Angel.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.330
Where have you been, girl?

02:42.363 --> 02:44.798
Papi told me you went
for that modeling campaign.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.334
-Good luck with that, girl.
-Thank you.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.168
I'm rooting for you.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.512
I need to see you bitches

02:58.546 --> 03:02.816
stomping down this runway
in your best 501s, honey.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.884
Hey, how'd it go?

03:03.917 --> 03:05.519
-I think I got it.
-Ooh!

03:05.553 --> 03:08.489
PRAY TELL:
Ain't nobody coming between you

03:08.522 --> 03:09.990
and your Calvins, honey.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.726
Aw... shoot.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.028
Come on, now, Miss Angel.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.330
(crowd cheering, whistling)

03:16.364 --> 03:20.534
Serving us them
good genes, baby.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.003
And I'm talking about denim...

03:23.036 --> 03:25.339
and skin.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.875
Ah, y'all like
that double entendre?

03:27.908 --> 03:31.679
-(cheering, whistling)
-Catch it, catch it, baby.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.682
(chuckling):
Ooh...

03:34.715 --> 03:37.050
Yes.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.519
Judges, your scores.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.422
Ten, ten, ten, ten...

03:41.455 --> 03:43.857
ten!

03:43.891 --> 03:46.394
You know it don't get
no better than that, baby.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.695
Come on, get this trophy.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.197
Just take it on home, honey.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.366
She branching out
into the world, y'all.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.067
She makes her own decisions.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.203
Yeah, honey,
it's your prerogative.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.038
* Make my own decisions... *

03:58.071 --> 03:59.607
The Evangelistas
are turning it tonight.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.709
* That's my prerogative. *

04:01.742 --> 04:04.111
-You want that... that arch?
-(camera whirs)

04:06.246 --> 04:08.582
Hell, you look like
one of them catalogue girls.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.718
-(clicks tongue) Ain't nobody
gonna be in no catalogue.
-(phone ringing)

04:10.751 --> 04:12.420
-Why? They don't pay
or something?
-No.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.622
'Cause I want to be in a
magazine. I'm a magazine girl.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.889
BLANCA:
Damon, get that phone.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.559
-LIL PAPI: Oh, my goodness.
-(ringing stops)

04:18.592 --> 04:21.429
DAMON:
Angel, it's for you.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.432
Oh, my God, it's Ms. Ford.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
ANGEL:
Okay.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.270
Thank you.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.939
Bye.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.108
What'd they say?

04:35.142 --> 04:37.978
Just... Pap. Pap, Pap, stop.
(sniffles)

04:38.011 --> 04:39.413
Oh.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.582
-Baby girl, I...
-DAMON: Angel.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.418
-I'm so sorry, Angel.
-That lady must be blind
or something.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.421
-Nah, she is wrong. I'm-a give
her a piece of my mind.
-ANGEL: Stop it.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.457
I'm tired of your scheming

04:49.490 --> 04:51.659
and your big plans
and your stupid dreams.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.761
You always putting shit
in our minds

04:53.794 --> 04:55.963
to make us think
that we deserve more.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.298
Why don't you just
focus on yourself?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.805
Just... leave me alone.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.144
-Don't worry, I got it.
-Mm-hmm.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.113
You okay?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.449
Yeah.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.518

05:25.559 --> 05:27.661
Work...

05:27.695 --> 05:31.331
Pose!

05:54.522 --> 05:55.989
I never wanted anything...

05:56.023 --> 05:57.825
as much as this.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.528
I was gonna snatch that title.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.566
Be a real Ford model.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.739
My face was gonna be everywhere.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.542
Well, look.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.177
I still see all that for you.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.913
You a model if I ever seen one.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.416
That corny-ass competition's
not gonna stop you,

06:22.450 --> 06:24.084
'cause it's your destiny.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.419
Oh, my God.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.257
Uh, uh... ah...

07:04.291 --> 07:06.560
-I'm s... I'm so sorry.
-No.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.463
-I-I loved it.
-I loved it... too.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.474
We should get a room.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.242
I'm...

07:22.275 --> 07:24.444
I'm not... I'm not in a rush.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.417
I've been waiting
for a girl like you.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.621
I knew you was the one
since I first seen you.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.456
Let me take you out.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.526
Like, on a real date.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.499
("Black Cat"

ELEKTRA:
So the Little Bitch is back.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.311
-Lock the door. Have a seat.
-Yes, mistress.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.147
(door shuts, locks)

08:03.350 --> 08:05.819
(sniffs)

08:05.853 --> 08:08.188
I see you brought me something
to add to my collection.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.024
-I did, mistress.
-Interesting.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.960
I've never used
one of these before.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.361
What's it do?

08:14.394 --> 08:16.463
You screw the poppers
to the front of the mask,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.131
and it releases
a slow, steady supply

08:18.165 --> 08:20.133
so you don't get a rush
all at once.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.969
I admit, I had
a moment of weakness

08:22.002 --> 08:23.370
the last time we played.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.339
But I cannot condone the use
of drugs in my presence.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.141
-(sniffs)
-I don't even take Tylenol.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.376
Name your price.

08:29.409 --> 08:33.581
$300 extra on top
of the normal $350.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.383
Whatever you want, mistress.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.552
Thank you.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.188
* Looking for you *

08:41.221 --> 08:42.489
* You're a rebel now... *

08:42.522 --> 08:44.491
(sighs, sniffles, exhales)

08:44.524 --> 08:46.894
* Always carrying on *

08:46.927 --> 08:49.830
* With the gang... *

08:49.863 --> 08:51.665
Hard day at the office?

08:51.699 --> 08:54.702
I got passed over
on a promotion

08:54.735 --> 08:56.403
by some Ivy League newbie.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.006
My sales beat him
the last three quarters.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.408
(sniffs sharply)
I cannot tell you

09:01.441 --> 09:03.376
-the amount of pressure...
-(whip cracks)

09:03.410 --> 09:06.546
Shut your mouth.
Leave your worries outside.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.684
-Mistress Elektra
will take good care of you.
-(sniffs sharply)

09:10.718 --> 09:14.421
* And I just now that
you're telling me lies... *

09:14.454 --> 09:15.689
How's that?

09:15.723 --> 09:17.057
(muffled):
Mm, perfect.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.859
* Short days, long nights... *

09:18.892 --> 09:21.394
Can you come back in 20 minutes
after everything's kicked in

09:21.428 --> 09:23.897
so I can fully enjoy my beating?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.365
Certainly.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.434
* But not for long... *

09:27.467 --> 09:29.202
I'm on your time.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.204
* Or you're gonna die *

09:31.238 --> 09:33.406
* You're so together, boy *

09:33.440 --> 09:35.108
* But just at a glance *

09:35.142 --> 09:37.077
* You'll do anything *

09:37.110 --> 09:39.112
* If given a chance *

09:39.146 --> 09:40.781
* Scheming, planning lies *

09:40.814 --> 09:43.383
* To get what you need *

09:43.416 --> 09:45.218
* So full of promises... *

09:45.252 --> 09:47.387
Bye-bye, now.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.890
* Don't you tell yourself *

09:49.923 --> 09:51.959
* That it's okay *

09:51.992 --> 09:53.727
* Sick and tired of *

09:53.761 --> 09:55.629
* All of your games *

09:55.663 --> 09:57.931
* And you want me to stay *

09:57.965 --> 10:00.567
* Ah, better change *

10:00.600 --> 10:02.269
* Makes no sense to me *

10:02.302 --> 10:04.905
* Your crazy ways... *

10:04.938 --> 10:06.740
Is my Little Bitch ready?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.909
* Why you insist *

10:08.942 --> 10:12.279
* On ways of living
such a dangerous life... *

10:12.312 --> 10:14.447
Nod your head if you're ready
for your beating.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.583
(whip cracks)

10:16.616 --> 10:19.787
* And I just know that
you're telling me lies... *

10:23.623 --> 10:26.593
(Elektra gasps, pants)

10:26.626 --> 10:28.128
Shit.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.496
No. No!

10:29.529 --> 10:32.099
Shit! Fuck!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.434
(hyperventilating)

10:34.467 --> 10:36.203
(Elektra whimpers)

10:38.471 --> 10:40.340
(sniffles)

10:40.373 --> 10:42.843
Paul, wake up.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.778
Wake up, Paul!

10:44.812 --> 10:48.315
Oh, God. No.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.785
No. Oh, God, no.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.487
Oh, shit.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.958
(breathing heavily)

10:57.991 --> 11:00.293
(knocking on door)

11:00.327 --> 11:02.362
Elektra, what do you want?
What are you doing?

11:02.395 --> 11:04.898
-Is there anyone here?
Are you alone?
-Yes!

11:06.499 --> 11:09.636
Blanca, I fucked up.
I really fucked up this time.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.304
Okay, okay, calm down.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.207
Well, give me something
for my nerves.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.484
There's something
I haven't told you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.486
And you can save your judgment.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.355
I'm employed
at the Hellfire Club.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.991
-You work as a mistress?
-Yes.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.227
I have this client, Paul.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.363
A little creepy,
but he tips well.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.497
He enjoys doing a little coke

11:37.530 --> 11:39.366
when we do,
you know, what we do.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.201
Girl, if this is about
borrowing money for rehab,

11:41.234 --> 11:43.503
I am not falling for that again.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.840
Will you just shut up
and listen!

11:46.874 --> 11:49.676
He likes drugs.
And to be restrained.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.212
So I put this gas mask thing
on him.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.581
He must have gotten sick,
maybe from the drugs.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.549
I swear I didn't leave him there
that long.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.887
-What happened?
-Uh...

12:01.221 --> 12:02.555
He choked on his vomit.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.758
Wh...?
Did you call an ambulance?

12:04.792 --> 12:07.761
He's dead.
I got scared, so I ran.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.063
You have to call the police.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.366
No. They'll arrest me
for murder.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.268
Does anybody know
if the body's still there?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.537
-I-I don't know.
-How long has it been there?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.907
Will you stop
with the fucking fifth degree?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.875
What am I going to do?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.944
You are going to trust me.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.381
(screams)

12:28.415 --> 12:29.883
If you didn't want
any of my advice,

12:29.917 --> 12:31.284
then why did you even come here?

12:31.318 --> 12:32.552
Exactly.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.754
I'm asking myself
the same question.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.590
-Should've gone to Candy.
-(Blanca muttering)

12:43.964 --> 12:45.966
("Nasty Girl" by Vanity 6
playing)

12:51.839 --> 12:53.640
BLANCA:
Elektra, what are we doing here?

12:53.673 --> 12:56.509
I already told you a
million times, Blanca-- go home.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.580
BLANCA:
Candy's on the pole?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.782
ELEKTRA:
How else is she going
to earn a living?

13:03.851 --> 13:05.585
ELEKTRA:
Move.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.954
I need to talk to you.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.956
* Don't you wanna
play my game? *

13:08.989 --> 13:10.623
* I'm lookin' for a man
to love me *

13:10.657 --> 13:11.925
* Like I've never
been loved before... *

13:11.959 --> 13:14.761
-What are you doing?
-Now!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.931
* 'Cause tonight I'm livin'
in a fantasy... *

13:17.965 --> 13:20.133
CANDY:
You hos kill me,

13:20.167 --> 13:22.335
coming at me
like I'm Dear fucking Abby.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.937
Run this back again.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.973
You gagged a man and he died?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.441
He white?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.177
Oh, bitch, you fucked.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.611
Candy, that is not helping.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.146
Tell her to call the cops.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.516
Hey, girl.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.785
Steve.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.454
You shouldn't allow clients
backstage. It isn't safe.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.789
Oh, let's not talk
about safety at my job

13:42.822 --> 13:44.324
when you just killed a man
at yours.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.626
Um, it was an accident.
She didn't kill him.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.829
Call the po-pos, and you're
definitely going to jail.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.364
'Cause ain't no way
that your broke ass

13:51.398 --> 13:54.834
is beating the best lawyers
that white money can buy.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.537
And you best believe
it's gonna be a big-ass story

13:57.570 --> 14:00.974
on the cover of The Times,
the Post, the Daily News...

14:01.008 --> 14:04.211
Well, shit.
Maybe you should call the cops.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.213
Exactly.
Somebody should call the cops.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.315
-We can explain what happened...
-Uh, we?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.884
Huh-uh, no, ma'am.
Ain't no "we."

14:10.918 --> 14:14.154
Do I look like I want to spend
the rest of my life in prison?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.355
Orange ain't my color.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.389
He had drugs in his system.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.824
The cops can't blame you
for that.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.493
They not gonna believe
a bunch of transsexuals, girl.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.395
Just let whoever finds him
deal with the mess.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.332
No. I think Blanca's right.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.834
-I'm going to the police.
-Thank you.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.702
Girl, you really think
your high-saditty ass

14:29.736 --> 14:31.404
is gonna survive Rikers?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.340
(scoffs) Listen.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.910
Somebody I want you to talk to
before you turn yourself in.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.512
-Okay? Come on.
-* Nasty girl *

14:39.546 --> 14:41.548
-* Nasty girl *
-* Do you think
I'm a nasty girl? *

14:47.720 --> 14:49.689
Girl, we are wasting time.
Every minute we don't report,

14:49.722 --> 14:51.858
-Elektra looks more suspicious.
-Your problem, Blanca,
is you think

14:51.891 --> 14:54.227
doing the right thing
is always the right thing to do.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.929
-Hey, girl.
-EUPHORIA: Hey, girl.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.531
How you been? You good?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.701
Ah, business is slow.
Damn Bush economy.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.437
Look, can we buy you
a cup of coffee?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.306
Girl, I don't drink no coffee.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.210
But you can buy my time.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.412
I never had one die on me.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.714
Pass out, start puking
all over himself,

15:14.747 --> 15:19.286
start crying about his wife--
now, that happens all the time.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.954
But full-on dying?

15:20.988 --> 15:24.257
That's some fucked-up shit.
What did you do to him?

15:24.291 --> 15:27.394
Nothing. He OD'd.
I-I wasn't even in the room.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.396
Which is why we should
call the police

15:29.429 --> 15:31.898
-and tell them the truth.
-Don't look at me, girl.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.067
I already told her
she was crazy.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.635
What world you been living in?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.570
-I've been arrested before.
-(chuckling): For hooking?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.939
And for protesting
at a bar once.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.475
Those are bullshit crimes.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.077
Ticky-tack stuff
the cops can use

15:44.111 --> 15:46.479
to prove they're
keeping the streets safe.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.149
Or as an excuse
to rough you up a little.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.651
We're talking
violent offenses here.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.254
And Miss Elektra crossed
the one line that our kind

15:54.287 --> 15:55.588
ain't allowed to ever cross.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.092
We're the ones supposed to get
beat up and die, not them.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.461
Tell them about the trouble
you got into last summer.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.665
A john picks me up

16:05.698 --> 16:09.102
in his brand-new Buick LeSabre.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.439
Nothing fancy.
$20 BJ in the back seat.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.476
I worked that thing
for five minutes.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.446
-(exhales)
-You okay, baby?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.448
You're using too much teeth.

16:21.481 --> 16:25.852
Honey, ain't nobody
ever called me toothy.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.654
I'm not the problem here.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.791
(cries out)

16:31.824 --> 16:34.327
(grunting and groaning)

16:38.665 --> 16:41.368
(groaning)

16:41.401 --> 16:43.336
-Help me!
-You bitch.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.343
Stop it!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.514
(siren whoops)

17:00.520 --> 17:02.655
OFFICER:
Sir, stand next to your vehicle.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.357
What's going on?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.859
EUPHORIA:
They heard what he had to say.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.496
He told them all about
his brother who was a cop

17:09.529 --> 17:11.998
somewhere out on Long Island.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.566
And how he was just
giving me a ride,

17:13.600 --> 17:15.835
and I tried to rob him.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.704
(chuckles):
"No good deed goes unpunished,"

17:17.737 --> 17:19.706
and all that bullshit.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.042
MAN:
Take it off.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.345
EUPHORIA:
On my first day in Rikers,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.180
I got beat up.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.517
On my second day, a guard
tells me he could keep me safe,

17:30.550 --> 17:32.352
even sneak in some cosmetics.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.088
Maybe even a good wig.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.258
-But it wasn't kindness.
-(camera clicks)

17:38.291 --> 17:43.530
He was just making me pretty
so he could pimp me out.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.365
Listen.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.234
A pretty girl like you

17:47.267 --> 17:50.603
doesn't want anything
to do with jail.

17:50.637 --> 17:55.242
And I don't care if they
got the guy dying on video.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.909
You gonna take the fall.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.546
For girls like us,

17:59.579 --> 18:03.049
the system is never on our side.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.451
That's all fine,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.286
but what the hell
am I going to do?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.421
I think I know someone
that can help.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.891
I heard she takes care of
situations like this, but...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.626
you gonna have to have cash.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.062
Oh, so what, we gonna add
new people to the conspiracy?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.231
-(scoffs)
-ELEKTRA: Blanca,

18:18.265 --> 18:20.933
-may I speak to you in private?
-What?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.304
ELEKTRA:
I know this is your house,

18:24.337 --> 18:28.408
-but your mother is sending you
to your room.
-Why?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.076
So you can get yourself
into even more trouble

18:30.109 --> 18:31.778
without having me
to get you out of it?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.946
Yes.
And to keep your hands clean.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.815
Thank you, but this is serious.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.117
Bigger than all of
our reading and shading

18:38.151 --> 18:41.087
and cutting and feuding.
This is your life.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.823
-You're my mother.
-And you're my daughter.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.259
And not responsible
for my sins.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.595
Whatever we're about to do
is reserved for those of us

18:48.628 --> 18:50.430
who only need a hot bath
and a stiff drink

18:50.463 --> 18:52.499
to forget things.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.302
-That's not you.
-That's not you, either.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.605
But I have no choice.
And neither do you anymore.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.775
Go. I don't want you to hear
another word of this.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.711
(sighs)

19:10.483 --> 19:11.818
Okay.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.387
Who's this problem solver
of which you speak?

19:18.558 --> 19:21.194
Oh, I don't do subbasements.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.029
Bougie bitch, come on.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.136
MS. ORLANDO:
I just need five minutes
to clean up.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.539
-And smoke me a Virginia Slim.
-(door closes)

19:34.006 --> 19:36.843
(gasps)
Not you, bitch!

19:36.876 --> 19:40.146
-Yeah, bitch.
-You cause me
nothing but problems.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.814
-Bitch, you almost killed me.
-No!

19:41.848 --> 19:43.316
You telling all the girls

19:43.350 --> 19:45.318
that Ms. Orlando
doesn't know her shit.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.388
-You cost me money, whore.
-I can cost you more.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.657
You two can argue over
your grievances some other time.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.494
I was told that you could
help us clean up a little mess.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.497
For a friend of hers?

19:57.530 --> 20:00.900
Never... (rolls "R")

20:03.102 --> 20:05.372
You earned your living
mutilating and scarring

20:05.405 --> 20:07.407
the girls of our community.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.175
I'm here to offer you
an opportunity

20:09.208 --> 20:11.210
to make up for your butchery.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.514
We heard you know how to get rid
of particular kind of problems.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.049
Like the kind that was breathing
that ain't breathing no more.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.518
And that you're a cleaner.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.353
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.688
Bullshit!
You habla inglé bitch.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.090
Word is a girl got sick
from some of your shit

20:24.123 --> 20:25.558
and had a heart attack
or something.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.427
And you got rid of the body.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.362
And you did the same for a girl
who knifed a john

20:29.396 --> 20:32.532
-who got rough
with her at the piers.
-(sobbing): More lies!

20:32.565 --> 20:35.802
-Now, leave!
-(exhales)

20:39.071 --> 20:42.542
I am not proud
of having to come to you.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.379
I don't know if he was
a good man or a bad man,

20:46.413 --> 20:49.582
but I know that he didn't
deserve to die like this,

20:49.616 --> 20:51.584
and he certainly doesn't deserve

20:51.618 --> 20:54.053
whatever we're going
to do with him.

20:54.086 --> 20:58.391
But something must be done,
and we need your help.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.560
MS. ORLANDO:
Mm.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.630
Was he a tall man?

21:03.663 --> 21:06.433
-Was he fat?
-What does that matter?

21:06.466 --> 21:11.438
I just need to know how big
of a suitcase I need to bring.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.983
We have four hours until
the cleaning crew comes

21:24.016 --> 21:25.918
to get the room ready
for the next shift.

21:25.952 --> 21:30.122
We should get anything that
could trace him back to here.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.458
CANDY:
Hold up.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.761
I know this motherfucker--
Paul.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.129
They banned him from the
strip club 'cause he would take

21:37.163 --> 21:38.965
the girls in the back
and smack 'em around.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.800
I say we take him outside
and leave him

21:40.833 --> 21:42.502
dressed up just like he is.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.470
MS. ORLANDO:
Mm-mm-mm.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.304
We put him back in the suitcase,

21:45.338 --> 21:47.440
and we take him somewhere safe.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.808
Vamos!

21:56.683 --> 21:58.718
(elevator bell chimes)

22:01.388 --> 22:04.190
Sh... Damn it!

22:04.223 --> 22:06.626
-What a mess.
-I can't do anything.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.295
That's okay. I got you.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.631
I'm sorry about the other day.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.333
It's all right, I just...

22:14.367 --> 22:18.037
Um, I long forgave you
for your-your outburst.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.672
(chuckles)

22:22.509 --> 22:23.810
-You all right?
-Yeah.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.512
I just got a lot on my mind.

22:25.545 --> 22:26.846
You want to talk about it?

22:26.879 --> 22:28.815
No. You first.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.850
Papi has been pouting all day.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.020
What did you do to him?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.390
(door opens)

22:40.026 --> 22:41.661
(door shuts)

22:41.694 --> 22:45.231
Speaking of the devil.
You gonna go handle that?

22:51.103 --> 22:52.505
Why you acting like that?

22:52.539 --> 22:54.507
I'm not acting like nothing.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.208
Yes, you are.

22:56.242 --> 22:59.345
Look, you're the one ignoring me
ever since I asked you out.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.413
No, I'm not.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.416
You kissed me
'cause you was sad.

23:03.450 --> 23:07.053
It was a pity kiss, and now you
don't know how to act around me.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.057
Go ahead, reject me.
I can handle it.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.859
I'm not just some hoodrat
who can't see

23:12.892 --> 23:15.261
he ain't got shit
to bag a girl like you.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.730
Papi...

23:24.270 --> 23:26.072
That's not true.

23:26.105 --> 23:29.108
I'm just scared.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.912
I don't want to ruin
what we have.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.982
You're family.

23:38.918 --> 23:42.088
You mean so much to me.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.390
I can be more.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.393
Give me a shot.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.461
Let me show you.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.062
Show me what?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.330
This right here.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.135
Oh! Who needs The Young and
the Restless when you got this?

23:56.168 --> 23:57.804
All right,
get y'all asses in here.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.238
Dinner's served.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.907
When are you taking me out?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.275
Whenever you want.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.124
That bitch ran off
with my money.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.759
Never trust a girl
who works the pole.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.427
You blaming me?
(scoffs)

24:21.460 --> 24:23.429
Okay, fine.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.997
I'll leave.

24:25.031 --> 24:28.000
I ain't the one with a dead
white boy in her bedroom.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.102
Talk to me crazy.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.606
I got some goodies
to play with.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.141
What is all this?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.510
The lye is for the smell.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.279
The pleather is easy
to work with,

24:40.312 --> 24:42.815
and most importantly,
it doesn't leak.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.351
We're gonna wrap him up,

24:45.384 --> 24:47.153
we're gonna sew him in,

24:47.186 --> 24:49.956
and we're gonna put him
in that closet

24:49.989 --> 24:51.323
with some boxes over.

24:51.357 --> 24:57.530
And I promise you,
no one will ever know.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.533
A beautiful little cocoon.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.568
Hmm.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.205
It works.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.207
I have a friend in Honduras.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.509
Her husband used to
beat her with a hanger

25:10.543 --> 25:13.546
that he used to heat up first
over the fire.

25:13.580 --> 25:18.651
Until one day she shot
the motherfucker dead,

25:18.685 --> 25:20.386
right in the belly.

25:20.419 --> 25:24.490
And all the ladies in town
came to help her cocoon him

25:24.523 --> 25:25.892
so she wouldn't get in trouble.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.394
That's what we do-- women.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.830
Is that how you got rid
of the body of that girl

25:30.863 --> 25:33.499
who had a bad reaction to some
of your ghetto silicone?

25:33.532 --> 25:37.870
My silicone is primo shit!

25:37.904 --> 25:40.840
That girl had some kind
of problem or something.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.043
Now, are we going
to do this or not?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.545
Because it's going to take time.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.716
And I... I have a hair
appointment at 10:00.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.184
-Come on.
-Can we at least say a prayer

25:52.218 --> 25:55.021
or something over the body
before we cocoon him?

25:55.054 --> 25:58.057
I told you, this motherfucker
got exactly what he deserved.

25:58.090 --> 26:02.762
But he's a human being--
some mother's son.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.530
(sighs)

26:04.563 --> 26:07.099
("Shame" by Evelyn "Champagne"
King playing)

26:07.133 --> 26:08.701
Ugh.

26:08.735 --> 26:12.872
Lord, the world can be
a cruel place,

26:12.905 --> 26:16.408
especially for women like us.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.711
We do not like
what we have to do

26:18.745 --> 26:20.713
to this man's body,

26:20.747 --> 26:24.050
but we have no choice.

26:24.083 --> 26:28.921
If we did, we would
do right by him.

26:28.955 --> 26:32.424
At least no one will know
how he died,

26:32.458 --> 26:36.629
which I'm sure
he would appreciate.

26:36.663 --> 26:40.299
Can we get to work now?

26:43.302 --> 26:45.437
(grunting)

26:50.142 --> 26:52.979
-He's too big to lie him flat.
-No.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.447
We have to fold him up...

26:57.984 --> 27:00.352
-...like a baby.
-Ugh.

27:02.488 --> 27:05.992
Hey, you didn't kill him.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.160
Come on, help me.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.330
* You got me so confused,
it's a shame *

27:11.363 --> 27:14.934
* Sometimes I think
I'm going insane *

27:14.967 --> 27:17.336
* But still I want to stay *

27:17.369 --> 27:19.438
* Wrapped in your arms *

27:19.471 --> 27:21.440
* Is where I want to be *

27:21.473 --> 27:24.443
-* I want to be *
-* Want to be *

27:24.476 --> 27:26.779
* Wrapped in your arms *

27:26.813 --> 27:28.781
* That's my high *

27:28.815 --> 27:31.283
* My high *

27:31.317 --> 27:33.185
* Shame, ooh *

27:33.219 --> 27:36.655
* My mother says
you're playing a game *

27:36.689 --> 27:39.458
* And what you do to me
is a shame *

27:39.491 --> 27:43.996
* Ooh, gonna love you
just the same *

27:44.030 --> 27:45.798
* Mama just don't understand *

27:45.832 --> 27:47.633
* Wrapped in your arms... *

27:47.666 --> 27:50.136
MS. ORLANDO:
Now, we have to sew him tight.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.172
No holes, no seams.

27:53.205 --> 27:57.476
Because when the body start
decomposing,

27:57.509 --> 28:01.013
he's gonna spill out
all over your heels.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.414
* I can't get enough *

28:03.549 --> 28:05.051
* Ooh, baby *

28:05.084 --> 28:07.854
* Enough of that magic touch *

28:07.887 --> 28:10.189
* Love is in my heart *

28:12.524 --> 28:15.327
* Tearing the rules apart *

28:15.361 --> 28:18.330
* So, why should I
be ashamed? *

28:18.364 --> 28:20.432
ANGEL:
Ay.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.170
Hmm.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.372
Nothing feels right
for Barbetta.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.674
It's impossible to get
a reservation there.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.910
-How did Papi pull that off?
-I don't know.

28:30.943 --> 28:34.180
He's a hustler.
That's what I like about him.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.749
He can do anything.
He's creative.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.385
What do you think
about this dress?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.388
Classy.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.356
-Mm-hmm.
-Very...

28:44.390 --> 28:45.858
Veronica Webb.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.527
But, girl, why you stressing
over it? It's just Papi.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.396
What you mean it's just Papi?

28:50.429 --> 28:52.865
Okay, for the record,
I'm Team Papi.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.600
All right? I mean,
his intentions are pure,

28:54.633 --> 28:56.702
he quit dealing,
he got that GED,

28:56.735 --> 28:58.370
and he got that job
at the Carlyle.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.239
I mean, I'm proud
of how far he's come.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.741
Mm, me, too.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.576
And I feel a "but" coming.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.715
But...

29:09.748 --> 29:12.284
you are a girl...

29:12.318 --> 29:14.386
that can get anything.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.957
-(phone ringing)
-Any guy that you want.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.258
Hello? Oh.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.261
-One second. Angel.
-What?

29:29.135 --> 29:32.271
MAN:
Angel? She's ready for you.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.582
MS. FORD:
Trust me, I have
the girl for you.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.185
Well... well, don't worry.

29:49.188 --> 29:52.124
Consider it handled.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.993
Angel, thanks for coming in.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.594
Mm-hmm.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.763
I assume you have regrets
about rejecting me

29:57.796 --> 29:59.598
in favor of that blonde.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.433
You're delightful.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.435
And as much as your sass
tickles me,

30:03.469 --> 30:05.271
it cost you the title.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.940
-Hmm.
-I have something for you.

30:07.974 --> 30:11.510
A group of Ford models
is on location as we speak

30:11.543 --> 30:13.812
for a cosmetics shoot.

30:13.846 --> 30:17.616
The client feels that
there's something missing.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.519
He wants something different.

30:20.552 --> 30:24.356
Well, I have a hunch that
what he's looking for is you.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.358
-Me?
-Yeah.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.961
You have something.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.796
It's just the Bronx.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.365
You ain't used to the realness.

30:33.399 --> 30:36.468
-The realness?
-Mm-hmm. Real.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.004
I'm of the people
from the sidewalk

30:38.037 --> 30:40.472
that you look down on
from your perch in the sky.

30:40.506 --> 30:45.044
Mm. Well, I'll give you that.

30:45.077 --> 30:48.547
Have you heard of Wet 'n' Wild?

30:48.580 --> 30:51.150
Mm-hmm.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.719
They've got the best eyeliners.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.487
You ain't got to
burn 'em or nothing.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.156
-Is that so?
-Mm-hmm.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.226
Well, it should be
an easy sell for you.

31:00.259 --> 31:03.362
To be the face of their
Spring Colors collection.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.532
Wait.

31:08.434 --> 31:11.370
My face is gonna be in the
makeup aisle at Duane Reade?

31:13.239 --> 31:16.175
Where all the girls
can see me?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.277
When do they want me?

31:23.249 --> 31:25.417
You're already late.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.386
(gasps)

31:27.419 --> 31:30.856
* Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to introduce the high hat *

31:30.889 --> 31:32.558
* Go on *

31:32.591 --> 31:35.694
* Mm, that's good *

31:35.727 --> 31:37.696
* Who's looking good today? *

31:37.729 --> 31:40.099
* Who's looking good
in every way? *

31:40.132 --> 31:41.900
* No style, rookie *

31:41.934 --> 31:44.436
* You better watch,
don't mess with me *

31:46.238 --> 31:50.409
* No moneyman can win my love *

31:50.442 --> 31:52.111
* It's sweetness... *

31:52.144 --> 31:54.880
-I like this a lot.
-STYLIST: It's great.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.883
* We always hang
in a Buffalo stance *

31:57.916 --> 32:00.286
* We do the dive
every time we dance *

32:00.319 --> 32:02.221
* I'll give you love, baby,
not romance... *

32:02.254 --> 32:04.556
You must be Angel. I'm Erik.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.558
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
How are you feeling?

32:06.592 --> 32:08.560
I'm good. I'm a little nervous,
but I'm so excited.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.562
Oh, don't worry. You got this.
I love this already.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.464
This is great. Let's try one
with the hands up.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.000
-I love that look.
-Okay.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.570
* Looking good,
hanging with the wild bunch *

32:18.604 --> 32:20.472
* Looking good
in a Buffalo stance *

32:20.506 --> 32:22.474
* Looking good when it
comes to the crunch *

32:22.508 --> 32:24.576
* Looking good's
a state of mind *

32:24.610 --> 32:27.246
* State of mind, don't look
behind you *

32:27.279 --> 32:29.648
* State of mind
or you'll be dead *

32:29.681 --> 32:32.418
-* State of mind,
may I remind you *
-* Bomb the bass... *

32:32.451 --> 32:34.753
Oh, perfect.
I love this pose, yeah.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.990
Hold that. Mm-hmm.
Right, right. Great, great.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.092
Mm. Yes.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.494
Give me a little vogue.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.430
Yeah, vogue a little more,
vogue a little more.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.099
There we go. Yep.

32:47.133 --> 32:51.437
Yes. You are a star, Angel,
you're a star.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.473
Angel, feel free
to use that stool.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.775
* No moneyman... *

32:56.808 --> 32:59.278
ERIK:
Get close, ladies.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.312
Right, right. Great.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.148
Oh, amazing.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.850
Great, I love this. I love this.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.785
* No moneyman
can win my love... *

33:06.818 --> 33:08.687
Great. Yep.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.457
Perfect. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.793
Great, great. Perfect.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.829
Shit. 7:35.
I got to meet somebody.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.299
(laughs softly)
We have you booked until 9:00.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.667
I-I got plans.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.136
Do you want to be
a social butterfly,

33:24.170 --> 33:25.871
or do you want to be
a superstar?

33:25.904 --> 33:27.506
It's your choice.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.483
Superstar it is.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.518
(camera shutter clicking)

34:07.079 --> 34:09.081
So we was at Palladium.
We had our own

34:09.115 --> 34:11.517
private table and everything--
all you can drink... and sniff.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.352
Girl, you had better kept
your nose out of that junk.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.386
DAMON:
Mm-hmm. No, but, no,
were you, like,

34:14.420 --> 34:16.355
behind, like, a red velvet rope
and everything?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.390
Yeah. So, um, Lindsey,
she's another Ford model,

34:18.424 --> 34:20.226
she's sleeping
with the club promoter.

34:20.259 --> 34:23.195
-Ooh.
-I'm telling you,
models are the new rock stars.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.731
That's not even the best part.
So we was dancing on the table,

34:25.764 --> 34:27.099
and guess who singled me out.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.401
-B-Bobby Brown.
-Guess again.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.204
Give us a hint, or else we never
gonna get the full story.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.372
My favorite designer.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.874
Oh, my God,
you met Isaac Mizrahi?

34:35.907 --> 34:38.544
-Girl!
-Yes! Girl, I'm telling you,

34:38.577 --> 34:41.380
you know what he said?
"You are the face of the '90s."

34:41.413 --> 34:43.949
-Bitch!
-Yes, I did.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.617
(laughing)

34:45.651 --> 34:47.386
-Yeah, girl.
-My daughter...

34:47.419 --> 34:49.721
out here
with the crème de la crme

34:49.755 --> 34:52.224
-of Manhattan high society.
-DAMON: Mm-hmm. Right there.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.460
-BLANCA: Girl, I'm telling you.
-DAMON: How could she do it?

34:54.493 --> 34:56.295
-ANGEL: Yeah...
-DAMON: Oh, what's up, brother?

34:56.328 --> 34:58.063
LIL PAPI:
Nothing much.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.898
Um, I'm so sorry I'm late.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.000
I picked up an extra shift.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.073
Let me go make you
a plate, baby.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.841
Thank you.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.580
(mouthing)

35:14.613 --> 35:17.449
Oh. I'll help you, Ma.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.262
You know, I wasn't gonna
say nothing, but...

35:30.296 --> 35:31.430
Pap, I'm sorry.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.765
I feel really bad,
but I have... but I have

35:33.799 --> 35:36.435
a really good excuse,
if you want to hear it.

35:36.468 --> 35:40.005
So, I did a photo shoot
for a real modeling campaign.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.140
It's gonna be in Duane Reades
and pharmacies and drugstores

35:42.174 --> 35:44.610
all over the country.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.445
Can you believe it?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.614
I wouldn't be doing
any of this if you wasn't there

35:48.647 --> 35:49.981
-to push me.
-Mm-hmm.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.219
I am so happy for you.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.389
(chuckles softly)

35:59.491 --> 36:01.793
But you fucked me up.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.162
I was flexing mad hard

36:04.196 --> 36:07.466
'cause I thought
I got the girl of my dreams.

36:07.499 --> 36:10.469
I felt like a real man for once.

36:10.502 --> 36:14.340
I told myself, "You must have
done something right

36:14.373 --> 36:17.409
to get her to say yes."

36:19.578 --> 36:22.881
I was ready
to sip champagne with you.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.484
But you didn't show up.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.186
And I was alone
like I always been.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.188
It was even like that. I had my
dress picked out and everything.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.691
Damon helped me.
I really wanted to be there.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.060
-Nope. Nah.
-I-I really wanted
to be there. I promise.

36:35.093 --> 36:38.196
I'm not gonna let you apologize
for doing what you had to do.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.166
This is your dream.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.568
You're living it.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.603
I'm happy for you, for real.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.376
-Angel, you making a mess.
-(chuckles)

36:57.883 --> 37:00.352
I'm-a check on your plate.

37:00.386 --> 37:04.423
Just so you know, though, you're
the only thing I've ever wanted.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.892
You are my dream,

37:06.925 --> 37:10.562
and one day, you gonna realize
that I'm your man.

37:10.596 --> 37:13.865
That I'm gonna protect you and
that I'm gonna love you right.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.401
Right now,
you can't see all that

37:15.434 --> 37:18.103
'cause you got your eyes
on other prizes--

37:18.136 --> 37:21.106
the photo shoots, the magazine
covers, the famous people--

37:21.139 --> 37:24.443
but, Angel, I am a prize, too.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.313
And I need you to know that.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.164
("Nighttime" by Pretty Poison
playing)

37:51.603 --> 37:52.638
You're late.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.640
The sun rises
when it's ready, Blanca.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.642
Now, what was so important
that you needed

37:56.675 --> 37:58.410
to speak to me face-to-face?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.479
What the hell do you mean,
"What is so important"?

38:00.512 --> 38:02.414
It's been two weeks
since that Hellfire business,

38:02.448 --> 38:05.116
and you haven't spoken
one word about it.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.488
I heard about
what you did with that body.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.156
Is that bitch Candy
running her mouth?

38:11.189 --> 38:13.291
I'll do the same to her
if she keeps yapping.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.494
Don't worry. Half of the girls
don't believe her.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.829
And the other half?

38:17.863 --> 38:20.332
They like me. They seen
the story in the papers,

38:20.366 --> 38:23.335
"executive gone missing,"
front page for a week,

38:23.369 --> 38:26.605
and they understand you did
what you had to do.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.307
What any of us would have done
trying to survive.

38:29.341 --> 38:32.344
And don't get me wrong,
I've had nightmares.

38:32.378 --> 38:36.147
I'm worried about you.

38:36.181 --> 38:40.386
You a hard bitch,
but even you got to be hurting.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.658
I've had nightmares, too.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.195
I see him.

38:52.498 --> 38:55.467
We put him in an old trunk.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.504
I move boxes around
to try to hide him.

38:58.537 --> 39:01.473
I worry that the others
can smell him.

39:01.507 --> 39:04.543
The worst part is,
late at night, when it's quiet,

39:04.576 --> 39:08.880
I think, "That's a human being
in there."

39:08.914 --> 39:13.985
I know he was a pig of a man,
but I pray over him.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.388
He's mine now.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.392
He will be with me
for the rest of my life.

39:20.426 --> 39:22.394
Well, you gonna be okay.

39:22.428 --> 39:25.330
Like you said, he was a pig.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.899
So ain't nobody gonna be
grieving over him.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.068
Look at the New York Post today.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.505
He is nothing
but a little story on page 22,

39:33.539 --> 39:36.508
and in a month,
everyone will forget.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.845
Euphoria was right.
The game ain't fair.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.848
We may cut each other up
like a pack of alley cats,

39:42.881 --> 39:47.352
but when the outside world
tries to tear us down,

39:47.385 --> 39:50.522
this army closes ranks.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.558
We sure do.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.593

40:01.567 --> 40:04.369
-Are you sure it's out yet?
-It's been two weeks already.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.904
She said it would be out.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.208
Oh, my God.
Yo, yo, over here, over here.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.410
We found it.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.913
(Angel gasps)

40:17.949 --> 40:20.619
You look so beautiful.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.887

Oh, my God.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.128
-You did this.
-(shouts)

40:30.161 --> 40:32.263
-Look.
-That's-that's my...

40:32.297 --> 40:34.733
Hey, mister, that's my face.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.568
(laughter)
