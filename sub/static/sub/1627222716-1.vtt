00:21.771 --> 00:23.807
<i>It's incredible!</i>

00:25.209 --> 00:27.244
<i>Two men found
shot to death inside of a car</i>

00:27.278 --> 00:29.612
<i>here on 107th and Inglewood.</i>

00:29.646 --> 00:31.148
<i>Police, now trying to
find the killer.</i>

00:31.482 --> 00:33.850
<i>When officers arrived,
they found the two men dead</i>

00:33.883 --> 00:35.152
<i>from multiple gunshot wounds.</i>

00:35.186 --> 00:37.154
<i>Officials are
set to release the results</i>

00:37.188 --> 00:39.022
<i>of this year's
homeless count today.</i>

00:39.056 --> 00:40.657
<i>Last year in the city,</i>

00:40.690 --> 00:42.926
<i>that number was more
than 34,000.</i>

00:42.959 --> 00:46.263
<i>In the county,
almost 58,000 people.</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:48.631
<i>The new
LA Rams and Chargers stadium</i>

00:48.665 --> 00:50.834
<i>is underway and
the city of Inglewood</i>

00:50.867 --> 00:52.769
<i>has been torn in two:</i>

00:52.802 --> 00:55.772
<i>Those benefiting the surge
in economic development</i>

00:55.805 --> 00:59.276
<i>and those adversely affected
by gentrification.</i>

00:59.310 --> 01:01.245
<i>Thousands of
new condos are being built.</i>

01:01.445 --> 01:03.646
<i>New parks, a new Metro station.</i>

01:03.680 --> 01:05.648
<i>Sending rent prices soaring.</i>

01:05.682 --> 01:08.352
<i>Great for owners, but the
majority of the residents here</i>

01:08.385 --> 01:09.420
<i>are renters.</i>

01:09.453 --> 01:10.763
<i>Of course,
like I mentioned, housing.</i>

01:10.787 --> 01:14.091
<i>And these are very real things
that people are experiencing.</i>

01:14.291 --> 01:18.828
And to have city officials that
don't want to speak to that,

01:18.862 --> 01:20.797
is really, really discouraging.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.067
<i>But if you can
look past the anger,</i>

01:23.100 --> 01:24.868
<i>you will see the fear.</i>

01:24.901 --> 01:27.338
<i>Development,
we're for development,</i>

01:27.371 --> 01:29.706
<i>but we want development
without displacement.</i>

01:31.741 --> 01:33.676
<i>And of course, we
will have more on this story</i>

01:33.710 --> 01:35.044

I want you to meet
my new friend.

16:41.118 --> 16:42.119
Hi.

16:42.952 --> 16:44.754
I was just trying to
keep her occupied

16:44.788 --> 16:45.855
during that altercation.

16:46.057 --> 16:47.767
You know, I didn't want her
to see all that.

16:47.791 --> 16:48.958
It's all good.

16:49.527 --> 16:51.228
You know,
my daughter's a big girl.

16:51.262 --> 16:53.064
She's seen stuff like
that before.

16:53.097 --> 16:54.577
I don't hide nothing
from my daughter.

16:55.299 --> 16:56.800
Is that a good thing?

16:58.269 --> 16:59.336
Who are you, again?

17:00.904 --> 17:02.038
My name's Shelby.

17:08.279 --> 17:10.281

17:10.713 --> 17:12.749
Go back to being a bad parent.

17:13.417 --> 17:14.784
Excuse me.

17:18.289 --> 17:19.722
You ready?

17:19.756 --> 17:21.058

17:39.008 --> 17:40.844
My dad and I were close

17:40.877 --> 17:42.679
You can tell

17:43.414 --> 17:45.014
And they both love basketball.

17:46.217 --> 17:47.218
Pound switch!

17:47.617 --> 17:48.651
Who's the best?

17:48.685 --> 17:50.363
What's her mother think about
her being in here

17:50.387 --> 17:51.855

17:51.888 --> 17:53.857
Girl, you ask too many
questions. Come on.

17:56.893 --> 17:58.373
I wish they would pull up
here though.

18:00.964 --> 18:03.800
Hey 'Keda! Good game, girl.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.102
- Thank you, Billy.
- A'ight.

18:05.369 --> 18:07.704
Woo! She was fine as...

18:07.737 --> 18:09.873
I would. Boy if she wasn't
Avery's sister, I would...

18:09.906 --> 18:11.741
You would what, nigga?

18:11.774 --> 18:13.444
I mean, I don't mean
it like that.

18:13.477 --> 18:14.554
She like my little sister,
homie.

18:14.578 --> 18:17.013
She like my sister too,
but I mean, she fine though.

18:17.046 --> 18:18.882
I can't at least say she fine,
bro?

18:18.915 --> 18:20.317
Uh! Uh! There you go.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.186
That's my girl.

18:23.387 --> 18:25.627
- That is all right. Good job.
- All right, take a break.

18:25.655 --> 18:26.624
Good job.

18:26.656 --> 18:29.726
Avery, man, I sure
appreciate you lettin' me

18:29.759 --> 18:31.895
come down here and
put up some signage.

18:31.928 --> 18:33.128
You've got it all around here.

18:33.164 --> 18:34.707
We'll be able to put out
some flyers out.

18:34.731 --> 18:35.798
This is very nice of you.

18:35.832 --> 18:37.033
No doubt man, we here for you.

18:37.268 --> 18:40.904
Well, good. And you know
anything you need for the Center

18:40.937 --> 18:41.771
you let me know.

18:41.804 --> 18:43.940
Matter of fact, what's your man,
Mikey?

18:43.973 --> 18:44.807
- Mikey.
- Mikey.

18:44.841 --> 18:46.186
Got Mikey sittin'
on the board now.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.911
- Yeah, thank you.
- So he's in charge of

18:47.944 --> 18:52.015
inspections, coding, anything
like that you want or need.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.751
I really appreciate that because
the Center made them,

18:54.784 --> 18:56.187
and we can make a lot
more of those.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.297
It's all about the Power Center,
man.

18:57.321 --> 18:59.361
Like you said, that's what we do
at the Center here.

18:59.390 --> 19:02.259
But you know what, if ever,
if ever you think

19:02.293 --> 19:04.228
about turning it back
over to the city...

19:04.928 --> 19:08.765
let me know. Let me know because
we can make a lot of money.

19:08.798 --> 19:10.243
- I'm, I'm not...
- A lot of money right now,

19:10.267 --> 19:11.801
and not for just me.
I mean for you.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.046
- I'm not interested.
- A lot of money.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.315
I'm not interested. It's not
really about the money for me.

19:15.339 --> 19:16.483
Well, don't rush out now,
because

19:16.507 --> 19:19.909
the revitalization of Inglewood
is what we're all about.

19:19.943 --> 19:21.978
- That's exactly what I'm about.
- That's right.

19:22.011 --> 19:23.813
But I wanna enrich
our own people,

19:23.846 --> 19:25.082
not make the wealthy richer.

19:25.449 --> 19:27.418
See that's our problem, man.

19:27.451 --> 19:29.429
See, we think selling out to
the white infrastructure,

19:29.453 --> 19:30.787
that's success.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.189
- That ain't success.
- No...

19:32.223 --> 19:35.392
This is they system. They
designed it for them to win.

19:35.725 --> 19:39.263
And we just monopoly pieces
that they can move around.

19:39.296 --> 19:41.065
We land on their property,
we got to pay

19:41.098 --> 19:43.967
or we got to go to jail
without collecting 200 dollars.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.768
See I like that
Monopoly analogy.

19:45.802 --> 19:47.438
See right now, we Baltic.

19:47.471 --> 19:48.591
We Baltic and Mediterranean.

19:49.573 --> 19:51.251
We wanna move 'round to
the money side of the board.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.110
You know? And when
I play Monopoly,

19:53.143 --> 19:54.811
I always liked the wheelbarrows

19:54.844 --> 19:57.114
because wheelbarrows...
You got a wheelbarrow

19:57.147 --> 19:58.282
full of 'em over here.

19:58.315 --> 19:59.949
You know what? Um.

20:00.451 --> 20:03.120
I've got a fundraiser that
I'm going to be doing.

20:03.153 --> 20:06.257
And some of these girls would be
really, really nice.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.058
- Could you make sure...
- I gotta get back.

20:08.092 --> 20:08.791
Especially the Asian one.

20:08.825 --> 20:10.461
I would love to...

20:10.494 --> 20:11.462
Asian, that's my...

20:11.495 --> 20:13.039
I gotta go do
these drills with my daughter.

20:13.063 --> 20:14.423
Nice chatting with you,
Councilman.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.042
Just anything you can do
to help me out with the girls.

20:16.066 --> 20:18.968
Okay? I just wanna, uh,
talk to the young ladies.

20:19.002 --> 20:20.846
- This is your daughter?
- Yeah. That's my daughter.

20:20.870 --> 20:22.406
How you doin'? How you doin'?

20:22.606 --> 20:23.641
Vote Billy Bawls.

20:23.674 --> 20:25.875
Yeah, yeah. She can't vote.
She's six years old.

Yup. Every Saturday.

20:55.539 --> 20:57.441
Six teams, all females.

20:58.575 --> 20:59.909
Isn't it just a little weird

20:59.942 --> 21:01.312

21:01.345 --> 21:03.280
I mean, just a bunch

21:03.480 --> 21:04.881
with pink basketballs
and makeup.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.916
Girl, we all hate them
silly-ass names

21:06.949 --> 21:08.918
and them pink basketballs.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.221
That was Buck Star's idea.

21:12.289 --> 21:14.491
It's a little degrading to
women, if you ask me.

21:14.991 --> 21:16.893
Shit, I look good in my uniform.

21:17.761 --> 21:20.197
Plus, my brother's just doing it
to keep the money flowing.

21:21.131 --> 21:22.466
It's no different than modeling.

21:22.499 --> 21:23.634
Yeah.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.645
Yeah, my brother's been running
that community center

21:25.669 --> 21:27.071
ever since he got out.

21:27.104 --> 21:28.105
Got out?

21:29.673 --> 21:31.108
Of prison, white girl.

21:31.575 --> 21:33.210
Your brother was in prison?

21:34.144 --> 21:35.144
Damn.

21:36.246 --> 21:38.582
He could've went to the NBA,
but instead he went to CCA.

21:40.016 --> 21:41.251
What did he do?

21:41.785 --> 21:45.255
Really? He was just
protecting me.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.957
<i>And I was dumb and wild,</i>

21:47.990 --> 21:49.626

22:09.011 --> 22:10.046

22:17.154 --> 22:18.622
Get the baby!

22:24.328 --> 22:25.962

22:28.132 --> 22:30.167
<i>After that night

22:53.056 --> 22:56.560
All his dreams for creating
a better life, ruined.

22:59.028 --> 23:01.064
That's why
he's so close with Magic.

did you get enough to eat?</i>

23:26.190 --> 23:28.192
Yes, Ms. Watts,
it was really good.

23:28.225 --> 23:30.494
Now don't be so formal,
call me She Mama.

23:30.527 --> 23:33.664
Since you gonna be staying with
us and eating my good food,

23:33.697 --> 23:35.699
you going to have to participate
in the maintenance

23:35.732 --> 23:37.167
of this here kitchen.

23:37.201 --> 23:38.000
Okay.

23:38.034 --> 23:40.070
'Cause these dishes
need scraping

23:40.103 --> 23:42.072
and they not going to
wash themselves.

23:42.105 --> 23:43.540
Girl, you heard my grandmamma.

23:43.574 --> 23:45.642
They are not gonna
wash themselves.

23:45.676 --> 23:47.478
- Makeda, hush.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo!

23:47.511 --> 23:49.713
The Watts are in the building!

23:49.746 --> 23:51.215
Magic and...

23:51.248 --> 23:53.183
Shelby!

23:56.119 --> 23:57.154
Mmm.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.188
What she doin' here?

23:59.356 --> 24:01.167
She is staying with us until
she gets back on her feet.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.726
Feet look fine to me.

24:02.759 --> 24:05.162
Now, I said that Little Miss
Shelby can stay here

24:05.195 --> 24:06.663
as long as she needs to.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.666
Yes ma'am.
So while y'all sharing

24:09.700 --> 24:11.368
and doing the Lord's work,

24:11.401 --> 24:14.471
playing adopt-a-white girl,
I gotta go make some money.

24:14.505 --> 24:15.815
You know what,
that's not even funny, Av...

24:15.839 --> 24:18.175
Avery, I don't want
you out there.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.576
I do worry about you, baby.

24:19.610 --> 24:21.245
I know, I know.

24:21.278 --> 24:22.422
But you don't have to.
What'd you taught me?

24:22.446 --> 24:23.680
Worrying is a sin.

24:23.714 --> 24:26.583
Worry about Makeda's little
friends in the house and stuff.

24:26.617 --> 24:28.428
Why don't you worry about
your criminal record,

24:28.452 --> 24:30.287
it's about as long as your hair.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.688
Yeah, at least I got real hair.

24:31.722 --> 24:33.566
C'mon Shelby, let me get you
some sheets for this bed.

24:33.590 --> 24:35.559
And if you going to worry
about something,

24:35.592 --> 24:37.461
worry about my baby!

24:37.494 --> 24:39.263
'Cause she stink.
She need a bath.

24:39.296 --> 24:41.798
- I don't stink!
- You do stink!

24:42.065 --> 24:43.032
Don't wait up for me,

24:43.066 --> 24:45.068
I'm gonna try to get back
before breakfast.

24:47.170 --> 24:48.210
Ooh, I can't wait to catch

24:48.238 --> 24:50.240
this little country-ass
nigga slippin', my nigga.

24:50.274 --> 24:51.408
Fuck, them niggas, homie.

24:51.441 --> 24:54.278
I don't like 'em.
And I don't trust 'em.

24:54.945 --> 24:58.315
'Specially that little skinny
roach lookin' nigga.

24:58.348 --> 25:00.260
What's that nigga's name?
Uh, Down South or something?

25:00.284 --> 25:02.753
Yeah, Down South, man.
Fuck them niggas, man.

25:02.786 --> 25:04.221
This is Inglewood, nigga.

25:04.421 --> 25:05.632
You think we just
gonna let some niggas

25:05.656 --> 25:07.791
come out here and
get money in our city

25:07.824 --> 25:09.326
without gettin' taxed?

25:09.359 --> 25:11.261
Got me fucked up, nigga!

25:11.295 --> 25:13.215
Why you think they call me
Kill Bill, nigga? Huh?

25:13.630 --> 25:16.166
'Cause I'm the motherfucking
bill collector, nigga.

25:16.199 --> 25:19.303
You got...

25:19.836 --> 25:22.272
Yeah. You gotta get
in the back seat though.

25:22.306 --> 25:23.583
Yeah they gonna get checked out.

25:23.607 --> 25:25.275
You gonna do me like that, OG?

25:25.709 --> 25:28.078
I see me like the little homie,
I see.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.180
The fuck you got? Shit.

25:30.213 --> 25:32.683
Yeah, I'm the motherfuckin'
bill collector, nigga.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.485
What up?

25:35.519 --> 25:39.590
You about to go rob a saloon
old gang-bang bandit?

25:41.892 --> 25:43.827
Believe me, nigga.

25:43.860 --> 25:46.363
Yeah, I'm gonna blow a nigga's
brains out, nigga.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.400
- Can I help?
- Yes, thank you.

25:51.501 --> 25:52.502
Isn't my daddy cool?

25:53.337 --> 25:55.138
He's a really cool guy.

25:55.172 --> 25:57.207
He says one day I could
play in the WNBA.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.575
- Really?
- Yep.

25:58.775 --> 26:01.378
He says, if I stay focused
and keep practicing,

26:01.411 --> 26:03.313
I'll be the best.

26:03.347 --> 26:05.515
So, are you going to be
staying with us for a while?

26:05.549 --> 26:07.451
Yep. Right here on this couch.

26:07.484 --> 26:09.286
Really? That's so cool!

26:09.319 --> 26:10.621
We can be best friends.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.656
And, you can play
on the basketball team.

26:12.689 --> 26:13.724
Right?

26:13.757 --> 26:16.560
And I think that is
a great idea, Magic!

26:18.428 --> 26:20.197
You know I haven't played
in a long time.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.199
Don't worry,
I can help coach you.

26:22.232 --> 26:25.302
It'll be so much fun! Please!

26:26.236 --> 26:27.404
Do I have to wear pink?

26:27.437 --> 26:29.706
I don't like it either, but you
can make pink look cool.

26:29.740 --> 26:31.208
Hey, what's wrong with pink?

27:05.642 --> 27:07.778
Yeah! Hey! What's up y'all?

27:07.811 --> 27:08.612
This is my home girl, Shelby.

27:08.812 --> 27:10.452
She went to college with me.
She can hoop.

27:11.481 --> 27:12.916
Put your bag right here.

27:12.949 --> 27:14.284
We can stretch right here.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.588
Oh my God!

27:18.622 --> 27:19.823
What?

27:19.856 --> 27:21.324
Your shoes, bitch.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.760
Man. This is all I got.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.729
Had 'em since high school.

27:25.762 --> 27:26.897
My dad got 'em for me.

27:26.930 --> 27:28.532
Whew, I can smell.

27:28.565 --> 27:31.334
Don't let them touch my shoes,
like keep 'em over there.

27:31.668 --> 27:33.270
What's she doing here?

27:34.271 --> 27:37.307
What do you care?
You don't care about this team.

27:37.340 --> 27:38.551
You don't even care
about this league.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.944
But I do care about
this community center.

27:40.977 --> 27:43.947
And we don't need no outsiders
who ain't from this community

27:43.980 --> 27:45.482
in our Center.

27:45.515 --> 27:46.583
She's not an outsider.

27:47.118 --> 27:49.453
She went to college with me
and we played hoop together.

27:49.486 --> 27:51.455
Plus I think she'll be
good for the team.

27:51.488 --> 27:54.558
But you gonna need way more
than the great white privilege

27:54.591 --> 27:55.726
to help this team.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.594
Privilege? You don't know me.

27:57.627 --> 27:58.762
I don't want to know you.

27:58.795 --> 28:00.430
Why are you actin' so stank?

28:01.465 --> 28:02.632
Know what, you're right.

28:02.666 --> 28:04.568
Do whatever y'all want to do,
okay?

28:04.601 --> 28:05.812
Man, I ain't got time
for all this.

28:05.836 --> 28:07.370
He's having a bad day.

28:08.004 --> 28:09.473
He's probably got
hemorrhoids again.

28:11.575 --> 28:12.615
Where were you last night?

28:13.744 --> 28:14.277
You better go on...

28:14.311 --> 28:15.146
Ah, you heard me nigga.

28:15.179 --> 28:17.414
Why is she talking to
him like that?

28:17.814 --> 28:19.449
I hate that word.

28:20.383 --> 28:21.618
What'd you say, White Girl?

28:22.819 --> 28:24.387
My name is Shelby.

28:24.421 --> 28:25.965
I just think the way
you're talking to him is

28:25.989 --> 28:27.357
a little disrespectful.

28:27.390 --> 28:28.592
Who is this chick, anyway?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.994
This chick is my home girl and
she plays for the team now.

28:31.027 --> 28:32.362
Says who?

28:32.395 --> 28:33.697
Says my family that
owns this gym

28:33.730 --> 28:35.398
and my brother that
owns this team.

28:35.432 --> 28:36.299
This Buck Star's league.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.901
Avery ain't got nothing
to do with that.

28:38.102 --> 28:39.402
Oh, that's what you think?

28:39.436 --> 28:40.470
Yeah. That's what I know.

28:40.771 --> 28:42.339
Well, I know you
better go ahead on.

28:42.372 --> 28:43.483
I know all y'all in
here bullshittin'.

28:43.507 --> 28:46.510
Don't matter anyway.
Y'all ain't gonna win one game.

28:46.543 --> 28:47.544
And whose fault is that?

28:47.878 --> 28:49.613
I'm the only real
hooper out here.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.014
You were the only real hooper.

28:53.283 --> 28:55.519
Sound like they might need
to play one-on-one.

28:55.552 --> 28:56.686
I think so.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.488
If I win, I'm on the team.

28:58.522 --> 28:59.823
Oo, I like that. I like that.

29:00.158 --> 29:01.658
Check the ball, Taylor Swift.

29:02.893 --> 29:04.661
Get in that ass!
Get in that ass, Shelby!

29:04.694 --> 29:06.429
She ain't even really fly,

29:06.463 --> 29:08.031
she more like a mosquito bee.

29:09.599 --> 29:11.368
Your ball. You take out first.

29:11.668 --> 29:12.803
You'll need the head start.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.010
Taylor Swish!

29:20.043 --> 29:21.578
That's gonna be
the last shot she make.

29:21.611 --> 29:23.547
Ahh, go get some shots.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.315
Whatever. Let's go.

29:28.485 --> 29:29.719
Get in that ass Shelby!

29:34.457 --> 29:37.427
Don't even worry. You got it!
Come on, keep your hands up.

29:42.499 --> 29:43.633
Find out the hard way.

29:44.601 --> 29:45.769
Don't let her intimidate you!

29:49.773 --> 29:51.041
Come on Shelby.

29:51.075 --> 29:52.995
Come on, College!
You was talkin' all that noise!

29:55.946 --> 29:56.947
Come on, Shelby.

30:02.053 --> 30:03.787
Girl, why you drop your hands?

30:03.820 --> 30:05.089
Check-up!

30:05.122 --> 30:06.123
Damn, Avery.

30:07.058 --> 30:08.892
I didn't think white girls
was your type.

30:11.494 --> 30:12.505
Where were you last night?

30:12.529 --> 30:13.930
I said I was busy.

30:13.964 --> 30:15.632
Yeah, busy being a little whore.

30:19.502 --> 30:21.771
I'm finished with her.
Finished with you too.

30:21.805 --> 30:23.183
I know you ain't gonna be
talking to me

30:23.207 --> 30:24.141
like that in my gym.

30:24.175 --> 30:25.718
Man, forget you and
this raggedy-ass gym.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.611
- Get your ass out!
- Gladly!

30:27.978 --> 30:29.479
Quit this whack-ass team.

30:30.714 --> 30:32.616
Man, get your ass outta here.

30:36.786 --> 30:39.522
Well, I guess practice is over.

30:40.358 --> 30:41.825
I just don't know what happened.

30:42.293 --> 30:44.061
Man, that's just Avery and Fly.

30:44.095 --> 30:45.629
They be on that
Ike and Tina shit.

30:45.962 --> 30:49.133
I coulda won though, girl.
That drama got in the way.

30:49.399 --> 30:50.901
Hey look, it's all good.

30:51.468 --> 30:53.703
Plus, look like we got a slot
open up on the team.

31:00.844 --> 31:03.680
Shelby. I was hoping to see you.

31:06.883 --> 31:09.552
Mikey, I need to
holla' at you in my office.

31:09.786 --> 31:10.921
Okay,

31:10.954 --> 31:12.022
I knew that was coming.

31:18.195 --> 31:19.596
My bad for the mess, man.

31:20.864 --> 31:23.067
Man, you would not
know all the shit

31:23.267 --> 31:24.935
I've been going through, man.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.670
Bills, checks...

31:27.504 --> 31:30.573
I can't imagine.
That new girl Shelby, though.

31:30.941 --> 31:33.144
- Oh my goodness.
- That's what you like?

31:33.177 --> 31:34.178
Oh, yes.

31:35.045 --> 31:39.616
A'ight. That's everything
we talked about.

31:40.617 --> 31:43.120
So, just sign right here
and they gonna give me

31:43.154 --> 31:44.188
three more months?

31:44.221 --> 31:46.589
That's it. It's a good thing
I jumped in though,

31:46.623 --> 31:49.093
because the city was planning
on locking the doors

31:49.293 --> 31:51.728
and red taping this place if
you don't pass that inspection.

31:52.129 --> 31:53.797
- I understand, man.
- All right.

31:53.830 --> 31:54.974
We gonna pray that
that don't happen.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.599
- Yes we will.
- All right.

32:00.036 --> 32:01.871
She was not Pretty City,
we're Pretty City.

32:01.905 --> 32:05.176
She do got something right here,
I'm just sayin' like...

32:05.508 --> 32:07.811
Oh Jesus Christ.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.879
Don't mind me. Carry on, ladies.

32:13.084 --> 32:14.617
I hope to see you soon.

32:14.651 --> 32:15.819
I'd like that.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.720
Okay.

32:23.893 --> 32:27.064
Girl! All week! Don't call...

32:28.265 --> 32:30.567
No smoking!
Don't y'all see the signs!

32:30.967 --> 32:32.635
Who's smoking?

32:32.669 --> 32:35.638
We can't have no smoke in
the Center, nothing indoors!

32:35.672 --> 32:37.040
Take that shit outside!

32:37.074 --> 32:39.609
- Oo.
- Always playin' and shit.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.780
Aye. He's just mad because
his girlfriend left him.

32:45.116 --> 32:46.783
That was a major buzzkill,
honey.

32:46.816 --> 32:48.256
It's too many Christians
around here.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.892
Mmm. This is a nice car, Lupe.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.994
Thanks to Mr. Buck Star
for this.

33:00.064 --> 33:01.931
Basketball Beauties is payin'
like that?

33:02.466 --> 33:03.800
Girl, no <i>mija</i>.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.069
He owns a gentleman's club

33:05.102 --> 33:06.903
and we do bottle service
over there at night.

33:08.072 --> 33:09.039
Gentleman's club?

33:09.073 --> 33:11.574
Yeah, girl.
It's French for a strip club.

33:11.608 --> 33:14.677
Call it what you want, but
my Benz is paid for, bitches.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.347
Tell 'em, Lucy.

33:44.275 --> 33:45.742
Councilman...

34:02.293 --> 34:03.726
Power Center, whatever you need,

34:03.760 --> 34:04.562
we got you.
We gonna hold you down.

34:04.594 --> 34:06.330
I ain't even gonna lie to you,
man.

34:06.363 --> 34:08.832
I'm like straddling
the gate still, man.

34:08.865 --> 34:11.102
Yeah, still walking around,
strapped up, man.

34:11.135 --> 34:12.812
Come on, you know
what we do at the Center,

34:12.836 --> 34:14.013
and you gonna come
to the Center,

34:14.037 --> 34:16.237
and you gonna rock with us,
you gotta give me the piece.

34:18.942 --> 34:19.942
'Preciate you man.

34:20.111 --> 34:21.678
- All right.
- That's love.

34:26.015 --> 34:27.318
- What's up y'all?
- Hey!

34:27.351 --> 34:28.785
How you doin'? Good to see you.

34:33.756 --> 34:35.035
- What's up, y'all?
- Ya all right?

34:35.059 --> 34:36.093
Hey!

34:36.594 --> 34:37.961
T, what's up with it?

34:37.994 --> 34:39.729
'Preciate you. 'Preciate you.

34:40.097 --> 34:41.831
Uh. Yeah.

34:51.208 --> 34:52.376
How you guys doing tonight?

34:52.409 --> 34:53.453
My name is Prentice Powell.

34:53.477 --> 34:55.778
I have a poem I wanna share
for you that I wrote

34:55.812 --> 34:57.081
for my son, Justice.

34:57.647 --> 34:59.216
Don't tell me I'm a good father

34:59.250 --> 35:00.984
when you don't know
anything about me.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.753
And the fact that I'm Black
should be irrelevant

35:03.786 --> 35:06.090
when it comes to my ability
to raise my son.

35:06.689 --> 35:08.658
<i>My skin tone should not
make me any better</i>

35:08.858 --> 35:10.994
<i>or worse when it comes to
the paternal instinct,</i>

35:11.027 --> 35:13.863
but, because fathers like me
are apparently extinct,

35:13.897 --> 35:15.366
I get extra praise.

35:15.765 --> 35:18.701
<i>And for what? For doing what
I'm supposed to do?</i>

35:18.735 --> 35:19.903
You good?

35:19.936 --> 35:20.936
From strangers.

35:29.913 --> 35:32.782
<i>Try never spending a day in
your life locked up in prison,</i>

35:32.815 --> 35:33.926
<i>yet still watch
your child grow up</i>

35:33.950 --> 35:35.685
<i>primarily through photos.</i>

35:37.388 --> 35:38.731
<i>And I know everything
in this world</i>

35:38.755 --> 35:39.889
<i>doesn't go the way we plan.</i>

35:39.923 --> 35:41.425
<i>I can accept that.
All that's fine.</i>

35:41.458 --> 35:43.298
<i>I just don't understand
how a man can be forced</i>

35:43.360 --> 35:45.962
<i>to pay half of daycare,
half of medical expenses,</i>

35:45.995 --> 35:48.065
<i>half of food, half of clothes,
half of water,</i>

35:48.098 --> 35:50.334
<i>but the same man that
laid down to create that child</i>

35:50.534 --> 35:53.002
<i>is not automatically given
half of the time.</i>

35:53.204 --> 35:55.206
<i>Something about that
equation is not right.</i>

35:55.239 --> 35:56.940
<i>And when I'm done
with this poem,</i>

35:56.973 --> 35:58.041
<i>I don't care if you clap.</i>

35:58.075 --> 35:59.252
<i>I don't care about your praise.</i>

35:59.276 --> 36:00.444
<i>I care about your kudos.</i>

36:01.744 --> 36:05.082
<i>I just want my air, my earth,
my water, my drive, my moon,</i>

36:05.115 --> 36:08.252
<i>my sun, my motivation,
my me, my son.</i>

36:12.223 --> 36:14.058
Money!

36:16.126 --> 36:17.094
What's up with it?

36:17.127 --> 36:19.129
Hey, we gonna get that
one-on-one eventually.

36:19.163 --> 36:20.331
Man.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.234
What up with you?

36:23.267 --> 36:25.302
Ah man, you know how it goes.
You know how it go.

36:25.868 --> 36:28.205
I know you probably think
I'm pressing you.

36:30.574 --> 36:32.976
That tool, man. I can't have you
out here walking around

36:33.009 --> 36:34.777
with a gun on your hip, man.

36:34.811 --> 36:35.979
Bro. You still on this bro?

36:36.980 --> 36:39.015
Yes. Yes we are. We...

36:39.048 --> 36:41.218
I care about you, Tako.
For real.

36:41.719 --> 36:45.489
I remember you being a kid
in the Center hoopin'.

36:45.788 --> 36:48.259
Dreams, goals, you had 'em.

36:48.292 --> 36:50.094
I don't want to
see that taken away.

36:50.127 --> 36:51.794
Come on, man.

36:51.828 --> 36:53.097
You better than that, dawg.

36:53.364 --> 36:55.999
Killa, look. 40 minutes.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.836
That's all I get of freedom.
40 minutes.

37:00.070 --> 37:01.281
When I'm on
that basketball court,

37:01.305 --> 37:02.872
I don't see the ref.

37:02.905 --> 37:05.025
I don't see the coaches.
I don't see the cheerleaders.

37:05.842 --> 37:07.177
I see a basketball and a goal.

37:08.911 --> 37:10.880
After that 40 minutes is done,

37:10.913 --> 37:12.015
I'm back in here.

37:12.383 --> 37:13.883
Survival mode.

37:14.084 --> 37:15.352
I understand.

37:16.487 --> 37:18.021
I felt the same way.

37:18.988 --> 37:22.192
But I can tell you, you can go
beyond those 40 minutes.

37:22.859 --> 37:25.362
That basketball, your dream,
can take you beyond

37:25.396 --> 37:26.963
those 40 minutes.

37:26.996 --> 37:28.332
It can take you all the way.

37:28.798 --> 37:30.501
But what you not gonna
be able to do,

37:30.833 --> 37:34.538
is have that fire inside of you

37:34.571 --> 37:38.342
to run up and down this court
if you locked up.

37:40.377 --> 37:41.944
Why you care so much, bro?

37:43.480 --> 37:45.014
You're one of
the most talented people

37:45.048 --> 37:46.517
I've ever seen in my life.

37:47.351 --> 37:51.155
And you out here wasting it away
on some gang bang,

37:51.188 --> 37:52.356
gun-totin' stuff?

37:53.190 --> 37:54.558
Love you, man.

37:56.893 --> 37:58.395
And I just want to see you win,
dawg.

37:59.563 --> 38:00.897
Real talk.

38:00.930 --> 38:01.931
I appreciate you.

38:04.101 --> 38:05.369
So let me get the piece, man.

38:12.975 --> 38:14.175
That's what I'm talking about.

38:15.079 --> 38:16.189
Don't put your
fingerprints on it.

38:16.213 --> 38:18.058
Yeah, I definitely ain't
puttin' no fingerprints on this.

38:18.082 --> 38:20.517
I got that from a crackhead
on Skid Row...

38:20.551 --> 38:21.918
I don't want that shit you.

38:36.633 --> 38:39.001
It's amazing how good you look

38:39.470 --> 38:41.638
outside those
basketball outfits.

38:42.004 --> 38:44.475
I guess I clean up nicely,

38:44.907 --> 38:46.976
but basketball
is really my life.

38:47.009 --> 38:48.178
I was never very good.

38:48.512 --> 38:50.381
They always kept me
on the bench.

38:50.414 --> 38:52.082
So nobody really paid
that much attention

38:52.116 --> 38:53.250
to what I was doing.

38:55.452 --> 38:57.154
See Avery, on the other hand,

38:57.187 --> 38:59.427
he was that one kid that
everyone talked about, you know?

38:59.556 --> 39:00.890
There's always that one.

39:01.658 --> 39:03.960
Were you that one
in your neighborhood?

39:05.662 --> 39:09.066
I was a good player,
but it was really my dad

39:09.099 --> 39:11.301
that encouraged and pushed
me through college.

39:11.335 --> 39:12.569
You say, was.

39:15.339 --> 39:17.474
He passed away about a year ago.

39:18.675 --> 39:20.144
I'm sorry, dampened the mood.

39:20.177 --> 39:21.578
It's okay.

39:21.879 --> 39:24.081
Let me try to lighten it
a little bit. Um...

39:26.316 --> 39:27.618
Let's cheers to our future.

39:27.950 --> 39:29.286
Our future?

39:29.319 --> 39:31.288
Yes. To our future.

39:31.855 --> 39:33.424
You're making big plans already?

39:35.992 --> 39:38.128
I'm always making big plans.

39:41.064 --> 39:42.584
I'm going to be
the Mayor of Inglewood.

39:43.367 --> 39:46.002
I'm going to make Inglewood
the new Beverly Hills.

39:46.703 --> 39:48.272
I would love you to
see it with me.

39:48.639 --> 39:50.507
And I know we haven't known
each other long yet

39:50.541 --> 39:53.177
but I need a woman
like you on my side.

39:53.544 --> 39:58.148
What do you think about being
a new future First Lady?

39:59.316 --> 40:02.519
First Lady? We haven't even had
our first kiss yet.

40:44.695 --> 40:46.063
I'm tryin' to get down.

40:46.096 --> 40:47.231
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

40:47.264 --> 40:49.333
What, lights ain't too
bright in Pretty City?

40:49.366 --> 40:51.235
That's funny shit,
awful stinky...

40:51.268 --> 40:52.512
Come on man, you know
them girl's trash.

40:52.536 --> 40:54.080
I'm trying to get down
with some real hoopers.

40:54.104 --> 40:55.239
You feel me?

40:55.272 --> 40:56.649
You good shorty,
you're a real gangsta

40:56.673 --> 40:58.342
walking up in my gym like that.

40:59.276 --> 41:00.277
Show me what's crackin'.

41:01.678 --> 41:04.046
Man, ball up.

42:49.286 --> 42:50.286
Good game, man.

42:50.721 --> 42:52.356
Yeah, you too.

42:53.190 --> 42:58.695
Hey, we gonna need them fancy,
you know, one, two, threes.

42:58.729 --> 42:59.863
Yeah?

42:59.896 --> 43:01.231
All right. Let's do it.

43:01.264 --> 43:02.299
- I'm with it.
- Dope.

43:02.332 --> 43:05.369
Hey!

43:05.902 --> 43:07.270
So, how'd it go?

43:07.704 --> 43:09.239
It was cute.

43:09.873 --> 43:10.874
Just cute?

43:11.174 --> 43:13.710
I mean, girl,
we bumped noses a little bit.

43:40.337 --> 43:42.939
No seriously, like you can tell
a lot from the first kiss.

43:43.273 --> 43:45.909
They say if there's no spark,
get out the dark.

43:46.144 --> 43:47.078
Ain't that right, Grandma?

43:47.111 --> 43:50.347
You got to get a man
who excites you, honey.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.483
But, a man with some substance

43:53.517 --> 43:57.921
and a man who runs
electricity down your back

43:57.954 --> 44:00.357
every time you see him, child.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.225
Electricity?

44:02.259 --> 44:03.336
It's like a shiver of
electricity.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.629
Hey, hey. Why y'all in here
corrupting my daughter?

44:05.962 --> 44:07.664
She don't need a man
for nothing.

44:07.864 --> 44:10.233
- All I need is you.
- Just Daddy, right?

44:10.267 --> 44:12.402
- Yeah.
- You don't need a man, but 55,

44:12.436 --> 44:14.504
60 years from now,
then you can start kissin'.

44:14.705 --> 44:15.872
- Ew.
- Ew, ew.

44:15.906 --> 44:17.316
Yeah. Matter fact,
go on out the room.

44:17.340 --> 44:18.442
Get out of here!

44:18.842 --> 44:20.477
Shelby was just telling
us about her date

44:20.510 --> 44:21.510
with your boy, Mikey.

44:21.878 --> 44:23.513
Oh yeah, yeah.
I heard about that.

44:24.082 --> 44:25.615
Makes sense.

44:27.017 --> 44:28.452
What's that supposed to mean?

44:28.819 --> 44:33.256
What? Nah, my man, Mikey,
he coming up in the world.

44:33.457 --> 44:35.492
You know, making a little money.
Shoot.

44:35.525 --> 44:37.728
The white women was bound to
come sooner or later.

44:37.761 --> 44:39.463
- Oh, my...
- She showed up.

44:39.763 --> 44:42.666
You know how it go, this is
a false sense of success.

44:42.699 --> 44:44.634
The unattainable. Yeah.

44:45.035 --> 44:46.837
First thing a black man do
when he make it,

44:47.171 --> 44:48.171
get him a white girl.

44:48.438 --> 44:51.007
So you're saying black men and
white women shouldn't date?

44:51.274 --> 44:52.843
They absolutely should not.

44:54.644 --> 44:55.879
Isn't that sort of racist?

44:57.848 --> 44:58.982
Really, Makeda?

44:59.316 --> 45:01.718
You got your friend in our
kitchen calling me racist?

45:01.918 --> 45:03.019
She didn't call you racist.

45:03.054 --> 45:04.621
She said,
isn't that kind of racist?

45:04.654 --> 45:06.289
Nah, nah. She said, I'm racist.

45:06.323 --> 45:07.557
Racist.

45:08.458 --> 45:09.493
In my kitchen using words

45:09.526 --> 45:10.886
you don't even know
what they mean.

45:11.528 --> 45:12.596
I can't be racist.

45:12.629 --> 45:16.466
See the definition of racism
is a systemic practice

45:16.500 --> 45:19.469
where a dominant race
oppresses others.

45:19.503 --> 45:20.904
See, in this country,

45:20.937 --> 45:23.406
my people have never had
the opportunity

45:23.440 --> 45:25.876
or the power to enforce
such practices.

45:26.177 --> 45:29.012
So let me give you some
Caucasian clarity

45:29.045 --> 45:30.214
and make it real simple.

45:30.248 --> 45:34.384
A subjugated group such as
Black people, can't be racist.

45:35.519 --> 45:38.522
Now, prejudice. Oh!

45:38.555 --> 45:39.923
We can be prejudiced as hell.

45:40.124 --> 45:41.658
Yeah. I prejudge all the time.

45:41.691 --> 45:43.493
Because white people
prejudge me.

45:43.527 --> 45:44.895
They feel like they
better than me.

45:44.928 --> 45:46.806
When I'm in a department store
and they look like

45:46.830 --> 45:47.898
I don't belong there.

45:49.066 --> 45:50.409
Or they get all tense and
uneasy when I'm in the bank,

45:50.433 --> 45:51.444
like I'm about to rob the place.

45:51.468 --> 45:53.336
Goddamn right, I prejudge.

45:53.370 --> 45:54.571
Okay Avery.

45:54.604 --> 45:56.873
Oh Lord, that's it.
You goin' too far now.

45:56.907 --> 45:58.618
You gettin' on my nerves.
I'm getting out of here.

45:58.642 --> 46:00.544
My apology,
but she gotta hear this G'ma.

46:00.577 --> 46:02.412
Well, I don't need to hear it!

46:02.445 --> 46:03.446
Yes, ma'am.

46:04.548 --> 46:06.383
See, you one of them apologists.

46:06.883 --> 46:08.552
Think you can say, I'm sorry,

46:08.585 --> 46:10.054
and everything will
be all better.

46:10.554 --> 46:13.456
And you say things like
all lives matter.

46:13.490 --> 46:16.860
Or, why can't we just get over
this race thing already?

46:17.161 --> 46:18.528
Well, I'm gonna tell you why.

46:19.197 --> 46:21.464
Just because you come down here

46:21.498 --> 46:22.933
and go against daddy's wishes
and

46:23.433 --> 46:25.769
date a little Black guy
every once in a while,

46:26.536 --> 46:27.637
doesn't make racism

46:27.838 --> 46:30.774
and the institutionalized
mindsets go away.

46:31.242 --> 46:32.676
It's here forever.

46:32.709 --> 46:33.844
You see where we at?

46:34.411 --> 46:37.347
We at Inglewood.
The hood, the trap.

46:37.714 --> 46:38.949
You know what that's like?

46:38.982 --> 46:40.483
Being trapped?

46:40.517 --> 46:42.419
Being stuck somewhere?

46:42.452 --> 46:44.821
Having a dream and not being
able to accomplish it?

46:45.256 --> 46:46.756
You know what that feels like?

46:47.457 --> 46:49.559
I've been here all my life
trying to get out.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.995
Now you, you can come down here,

46:52.196 --> 46:55.832
and you can date our cute guys,
and eat our good food,

46:55.866 --> 46:58.501
but then you get to go back
home to your daddy.

46:58.535 --> 46:59.803
Avery. Okay!

46:59.836 --> 47:02.405
Nah, what? 'Cause she got a cute
little light-skinned boyfriend.

47:02.439 --> 47:04.574
I bet you your daddy
wouldn't like you

47:04.608 --> 47:05.785
going down the aisle with him.

47:05.809 --> 47:07.444
Avery! Stop!

47:07.677 --> 47:08.677
What? What'd I say?

47:09.813 --> 47:11.115
Her dad is dead.

47:14.818 --> 47:15.952
Look. I ain't know.

47:15.986 --> 47:18.455
My fault. She called me racist.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.841
You okay?

47:41.178 --> 47:44.948
My mommy died when I was a baby.
I don't remember her.

47:46.750 --> 47:48.618
Daddy says that
she may have died,

47:48.919 --> 47:50.587
but he sees her every day.

47:51.655 --> 47:52.655
How does he do that?

47:53.490 --> 47:56.493
By looking at me.
I look just like her.

47:57.194 --> 47:59.529
Your mother must have been
really beautiful.

48:02.699 --> 48:04.101
Here's my mommy and daddy.

48:06.703 --> 48:08.139
They're beautiful too.

48:09.673 --> 48:11.942
Thank you.

48:19.216 --> 48:23.520
Mag, uh, give us a second.

48:25.822 --> 48:28.024
Daddy, why were you
mean to Shelby?

48:31.861 --> 48:33.697
'Cause I was being
a knucklehead,

48:35.532 --> 48:36.967
and I owe her a big apology.

48:38.202 --> 48:39.703
But you made her sad.

48:40.071 --> 48:45.142
I know. And hopefully,
she'll forgive me.

48:47.577 --> 48:48.697
You will forgive him, right?

48:49.180 --> 48:50.247
Why not, Sweetie.

48:50.914 --> 48:52.015
Group hug!

48:58.155 --> 49:00.023
I wanna let you two have
a grown up talk.

49:00.057 --> 49:01.891
All right. Thank you.

49:03.927 --> 49:05.729
That one...

49:07.664 --> 49:10.533
Look. I didn't know
about your father.

49:11.735 --> 49:12.736
I apologize.

49:15.005 --> 49:16.573
It's all good.

49:16.606 --> 49:19.709
I get a little hot-headed
and too passionate

49:19.743 --> 49:20.944
from time to time.

49:20.977 --> 49:23.580
So, it wasn't nothin' personal.

49:25.216 --> 49:28.119
Plus, you seem like a cool girl.

49:29.686 --> 49:30.920
Oh, I am a cool girl.

49:33.690 --> 49:36.659
All right, well. We good?

49:39.296 --> 49:40.297
Mm-hmm.

49:41.831 --> 49:45.735
Well, good night. I gotta go
make this little run.

49:45.769 --> 49:46.846
I know it's none of my business,

49:46.870 --> 49:50.673
but wherever you go run
at night, try to be careful.

49:53.310 --> 49:56.746
Thank you.

49:56.780 --> 49:58.648
But you ain't gotta worry
about the kid.

49:58.681 --> 49:59.916
I'm gonna be a'ight.

49:59.949 --> 50:01.252
I mean, where are you going?

50:01.618 --> 50:04.721
You really wanna know? Let's go.

50:06.689 --> 50:07.957
You want me to go right now?

50:07.991 --> 50:12.063
You tryin' to be about
that life. Let's go.

50:18.802 --> 50:20.113
<i>Coming up, man,
I got those tickets.</i>

50:20.137 --> 50:21.205
<i>Everybody hitting us up,</i>

50:21.405 --> 50:22.648
<i>Ball Up Three-on-Three
tournament</i>

50:22.672 --> 50:25.775
<i>is going down this weekend and
I got your way to get in.</i>

50:25.809 --> 50:27.844
<i>It's free, it's on me.
So keep it locked right here</i>

50:27.877 --> 50:29.346
<i>to Big Boi's Neighborhood.</i>

50:36.786 --> 50:38.255
Avery,

50:38.788 --> 50:40.224
you have a daughter.

50:40.657 --> 50:42.193
You want to go back to jail?

50:42.926 --> 50:44.961
What if you get caught
with this gun?

50:46.397 --> 50:47.931
What if I get caught without it?

50:51.135 --> 50:52.336
Look,

50:52.669 --> 50:54.037
I hear exactly what
you're saying.

50:54.071 --> 50:55.839
I say this to the kids
all the time,

50:55.872 --> 50:58.275
and I don't mean to sound
like a hypocrite.

50:58.875 --> 51:01.845
But you right. I got a daughter,

51:02.679 --> 51:04.381
just trying to make it
back home to her.

51:05.882 --> 51:07.184
Let's go.

51:11.888 --> 51:13.124
Ah.

51:14.891 --> 51:16.393
- Let's go.
- I'm not coming in there.

51:16.594 --> 51:18.795
Then you can stay
your ass outside then.

51:18.828 --> 51:19.929
- Where are we?
- Come on.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.969
Avery. This says no trespassing.

51:26.437 --> 51:28.738
Oh, she can read!

51:28.771 --> 51:29.906
Breaking and entering!

51:29.939 --> 51:31.841
I'm not being an accessory
to burglary.

51:32.176 --> 51:34.111
Burglary.

51:34.578 --> 51:36.313
Who says burglary?

51:36.347 --> 51:39.316
You got all these litigious
terms. Just come on.

51:39.350 --> 51:41.085
Whatever. I'm not going to jail.

51:41.784 --> 51:43.087
Me either!

51:43.487 --> 51:45.055
Let's go, Fox News.

Hey, we next, homie.

53:17.281 --> 53:18.948
Wait. So you still

53:19.183 --> 53:21.252
I mean, I thought you gave
it up after you...

53:21.285 --> 53:22.419
Uh-uh. No.

53:22.453 --> 53:24.455
Never give up. Know what I mean?

53:24.488 --> 53:25.955
Gotta keep pushing with it.

you was focused, dawg.

53:50.648 --> 53:53.117
Hell you mean, I am focused.
On this money.

53:53.651 --> 53:56.919
Yeah, you... start watching
the company you keep.

53:57.354 --> 53:59.223

since you talkin',

54:12.869 --> 54:14.013

Now you focused!

54:15.706 --> 54:17.840
That's what I'm talkin' about!
You want to...

54:17.874 --> 54:19.185
There's a lot of noise
being talked.

54:19.209 --> 54:21.044
It's errant opportunity.

54:21.378 --> 54:22.413
What you want to do?

54:23.747 --> 54:26.049
- We can get to it.
- I'll give you that.

54:26.083 --> 54:27.850
This the focus
I was talking about.

54:28.285 --> 54:29.486
Focus.

54:36.527 --> 54:38.095
That's what you supposed to do!

Kill Bill drunk ass wasn't in
the way, we'd be a'ight.

one don't work.

You know... you know why
you exhausted.

57:00.304 --> 57:03.073

57:04.274 --> 57:05.594
That's all you think about,
homie?

57:06.376 --> 57:08.616
That's all I think about.
Tell Slick to give me my money.

57:09.580 --> 57:11.580
You gotta stop messin' with
your man, this ain't...

57:12.216 --> 57:13.417
You won that too, homie.

57:13.650 --> 57:15.686
Hey you can keep givin' me all
the money I need.

57:15.719 --> 57:17.154
Nah. You can't... you can't...

57:17.187 --> 57:18.121
You can't get it all, baby.

57:18.155 --> 57:19.835
I'll give you about another
hundred, homie.

57:20.057 --> 57:21.817
- For giving me your time.
- I appreciate ya.

57:22.024 --> 57:24.094
Pleasure doing business with ya,
old man.

57:25.629 --> 57:27.231
Tuck yourself in.

57:27.264 --> 57:29.064
See, that's why I wanted to
bring you up here.

57:29.099 --> 57:33.002
We gotta toughen you up.
Get you a little thicker skin.

57:33.303 --> 57:35.272
I saw the way Fly was
pushing you around

57:35.305 --> 57:36.305
had you all flustered.

57:37.241 --> 57:40.143
This is street ball. Come on.
Toughen up.

57:40.577 --> 57:42.011
Check-up, girl!

57:42.246 --> 57:43.146
Right now?

57:43.180 --> 57:45.047
Ain't no clocks in street ball.

57:45.749 --> 57:47.551
- You're serious?
- It's street ball.

57:47.918 --> 57:51.788
Aggression, power, focus.

57:53.123 --> 57:54.124
Check-up.

57:55.192 --> 57:58.362
You gonna play street ball,
we gotta get you a street name.

57:58.996 --> 58:01.498
Can't be out here calling you
Shelby Van Der Gunn.

58:01.532 --> 58:03.100
Whatever.

58:03.500 --> 58:06.236
You gonna be a hooper,
we going to have to call you...

58:17.281 --> 58:18.815
A'ight. Enough with the smilin'.

58:18.849 --> 58:20.617
Let's get to it, Shotgun Shellz.

58:20.651 --> 58:22.686
I can show you with this one.
Ready to...

58:22.719 --> 58:24.388
Ooh! Passed her!

58:24.421 --> 58:25.822

58:26.757 --> 58:27.891
I'm just getting started.

58:27.925 --> 58:30.294
You got the rock now, though.
Come on. It's about you.

58:32.195 --> 58:33.597
Come on, Shotgun Shellz.

58:33.931 --> 58:36.300
You ready? You focused?

58:36.333 --> 58:39.102
You cold? Come on, you cold?

58:39.136 --> 58:41.171
Come on, Frozen. Let's go.

58:41.772 --> 58:43.407
Let's go, Elsa.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.309
Whoa, no!

58:45.342 --> 58:48.312
Nu-uh. The outside shot,
it's pretty.

58:48.345 --> 58:49.345
It's very pretty.

58:49.680 --> 58:51.515
But I'm going to smack it
down every time.

58:52.215 --> 58:53.350
Go to the rack.

58:53.383 --> 58:55.419
Street ball.
Where you at? Where you at?

58:55.452 --> 58:58.221
Where you at?

58:59.222 --> 59:00.257
Nope.

59:03.393 --> 59:06.229
I need you to be aggressive.
Stop being scared.

59:06.263 --> 59:07.698

59:12.636 --> 59:14.338
- What?
- Blocking a girl.

59:14.371 --> 59:15.571
I don't see no girls out here!

59:15.672 --> 59:18.275
Money on spot.

59:18.308 --> 59:19.519

59:19.543 --> 59:21.178
You see what I'm doin'. C'mon.

1:00:11.895 --> 1:00:13.363
I have to after that.

1:00:14.132 --> 1:00:16.366
Welcome to Inglewood.

1:00:20.270 --> 1:00:21.550
<i>You ever get scared living here?</i>

1:00:22.839 --> 1:00:23.940
I'm from here.

1:00:24.207 --> 1:00:26.910
I understand everything
about these streets.

1:00:27.778 --> 1:00:31.448
No matter how many condos
and stadiums they build,

1:00:33.283 --> 1:00:34.751
Inglewood raised me.

1:00:36.453 --> 1:00:38.922
Ain't... ain't nothing to be
scared of.

1:00:39.456 --> 1:00:41.776
It's kind of like I was telling
you out there on the court.

1:00:43.927 --> 1:00:45.762
When it's tough,
you just get tougher.

1:00:46.930 --> 1:00:48.298
I get it.

1:00:48.665 --> 1:00:50.400
Yeah. I saw you.

1:00:50.901 --> 1:00:53.303
You picked up on...
You was out there hoopin'!

1:00:53.336 --> 1:00:55.405
I mean, I was impressed.

1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:57.874
You could ball for real.

1:00:59.443 --> 1:01:01.311
Why'd you stop
playing in college?

1:01:03.747 --> 1:01:05.916
Basketball was really
my dad's dream.

1:01:07.918 --> 1:01:10.687
He wanted what was best for me.
You know?

1:01:11.122 --> 1:01:12.889
Like you and Magic.

1:01:14.925 --> 1:01:16.793
<i>I was at home visiting one time.</i>

1:01:18.595 --> 1:01:20.430
<i>We were playing basketball
in the backyard.</i>

1:01:26.269 --> 1:01:27.671
<i>He just passed out.</i>

1:01:29.806 --> 1:01:30.874
<i>Heart attack.</i>

1:01:34.544 --> 1:01:36.513
<i>To this day,
my mother still blames me.</i>

1:01:40.650 --> 1:01:42.419
Sorry to hear that.

1:01:44.621 --> 1:01:46.456
I never went back to
school after that.

1:01:47.424 --> 1:01:49.292
I couldn't imagine

1:01:49.326 --> 1:01:50.526
picking up a basketball again.

1:01:55.565 --> 1:01:57.367
Until I saw you and Magic.

1:02:01.004 --> 1:02:02.539
I never met my father.

1:02:04.108 --> 1:02:05.509
I guess that's why...

1:02:06.376 --> 1:02:08.645
I guess that's why me
and Magic so close.

1:02:09.579 --> 1:02:11.882
I want to give her everything
that I never had.

1:02:14.451 --> 1:02:17.454
Plan was to leave
the community center to her.

1:02:17.988 --> 1:02:19.389
Was?

1:02:20.857 --> 1:02:23.493
I mean,
since we sharin' secrets,

1:02:25.695 --> 1:02:28.665
I haven't really told
anybody this,

1:02:28.698 --> 1:02:31.735
but in the basement

1:02:32.803 --> 1:02:35.672
there's sorta this gas leak.

1:02:36.807 --> 1:02:38.575
I tried to fix it, but...

1:02:38.608 --> 1:02:42.646
I've got about half the money
I need for the renovations.

1:02:43.647 --> 1:02:45.315
I just need a little more time.

1:02:46.383 --> 1:02:47.884
This gentrification
shit is real.

1:02:49.086 --> 1:02:52.422
I mean, the bank, the city,
they...

1:02:52.455 --> 1:02:54.825
they own me. Like...

1:02:55.358 --> 1:02:58.528
Whatever they can do
to just take the Center

1:02:58.562 --> 1:03:01.631
right from me and tear it down,

1:03:01.665 --> 1:03:04.568
so they can build some
overpriced condos.

1:03:05.368 --> 1:03:07.404
That's why I'm out here hustlin'
every night.

1:03:08.004 --> 1:03:09.673
Hoopin'.

1:03:10.308 --> 1:03:11.788
I mean, you know,
what would be great.

1:03:12.076 --> 1:03:15.579
It's a long shot, but,
to actually get

1:03:15.612 --> 1:03:18.715
to this three-on-three
and take it all the way.

1:03:18.748 --> 1:03:21.852
Win that 100K. That would
fix all my problems.

1:03:22.452 --> 1:03:23.987
So you think you can win it?

1:03:24.188 --> 1:03:26.123
I know I could win it, shoot.

1:03:26.157 --> 1:03:27.591
I'm Avery Watts.

1:03:28.725 --> 1:03:30.061
I don't know.

1:03:31.561 --> 1:03:34.098
There it is, the Forum.

1:03:34.364 --> 1:03:38.602
It's my only dream.
To be on the Lakers.

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:42.639
And then hang my jersey
in there one day.

1:03:42.672 --> 1:03:43.773
Right next to Kobe.

1:03:44.641 --> 1:03:47.677
Shaq, Worthy. Magic!

1:03:50.013 --> 1:03:52.116
It's funny though,
how your life can just change

1:03:52.149 --> 1:03:53.383
in a blink of an eye.

1:03:55.952 --> 1:03:59.556
Oh shit. Just chill out.

1:04:00.924 --> 1:04:03.593
Keep calm. Don't say nothin'.
I got this.

1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:18.109
Just chill out.

1:04:19.943 --> 1:04:21.544
I'll handle everything.

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:24.414
Keep your hands on
the steering wheel, please.

1:04:24.948 --> 1:04:25.949
Yes, sir.

1:04:28.618 --> 1:04:29.753
Miss, are you okay?

1:04:30.187 --> 1:04:31.188
I'm fine.

1:04:31.389 --> 1:04:32.622
Are you sure?

1:04:32.989 --> 1:04:34.491
I said, I'm fine.

1:04:35.425 --> 1:04:40.563
Sir, um, could you tell me
why you stopped me?

1:04:40.597 --> 1:04:42.632
I was just showing
my friend the arena...

1:04:42.666 --> 1:04:45.026
I pulled you over because you
weren't wearing your seatbelt.

1:04:46.736 --> 1:04:49.906
Sorry sir. Um yeah, we were...

1:04:50.107 --> 1:04:51.741
- We just...
- Step out of the car.

1:04:53.510 --> 1:04:55.512
That's a little bit...

1:04:55.545 --> 1:04:57.047
Shut up and step out of the car!

1:05:05.021 --> 1:05:06.157
Hands on the hood.

1:05:13.730 --> 1:05:14.907
So you're not going to ask
for my regist...

1:05:14.931 --> 1:05:16.733
Why are you still talking?

1:05:16.766 --> 1:05:18.135
Ah!

1:05:18.169 --> 1:05:19.903
Why are you treating him
like a criminal?

1:05:19.936 --> 1:05:21.638
You haven't even asked
him his name.

1:05:21.671 --> 1:05:24.141
Dispatch reported shots fired
in this area moments ago

1:05:24.175 --> 1:05:26.042
and this trash definitely
fits the description.

1:05:26.410 --> 1:05:27.811
You got a weapon on you, boy?

1:05:28.079 --> 1:05:29.946
You're gonna want to let me
know right now.

1:05:35.286 --> 1:05:37.188
Maybe you should be paying
attention to that

1:05:37.221 --> 1:05:38.998
- instead of harassing us.
- Would you shut your mouth!

I didn't see you after the game.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.471
You must've been busy.
Can I see you now?

1:13:07.805 --> 1:13:09.673

1:13:19.116 --> 1:13:21.050
Yeah. What about tomorrow?

1:13:21.084 --> 1:13:22.495
I'm meeting with

I wanted to run by you.

1:13:29.159 --> 1:13:30.936
Tell me what, you know I'll do
anything for you.

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.397
It's not really for me,
it's for Avery.

1:13:36.733 --> 1:13:38.168
Anything for him, too.

1:13:42.239 --> 1:13:45.542
All right, come on, little girl.
Let's do it.

1:13:46.376 --> 1:13:48.212
He doesn't really want
anyone to know,

1:13:48.245 --> 1:13:50.280
but there's sort of a gas leak.

1:13:52.516 --> 1:13:54.016

1:15:36.353 --> 1:15:39.156
It's Michael. No more Mikey.

1:15:39.356 --> 1:15:41.825
As Economic and Development
Director of Blanco Bank

1:15:41.858 --> 1:15:43.803
and junior board member of
Inglewood City Council,

1:15:43.827 --> 1:15:46.296
it's my job to uphold
coding and zoning

1:15:46.330 --> 1:15:47.464
and safety operations.

1:15:47.497 --> 1:15:48.697
And it's come to my attention,

1:15:48.999 --> 1:15:50.276
you've been running
your facility

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:51.602
with a hazardous gas leak.

1:15:52.269 --> 1:15:54.171
How do you know about
the gas leak?

1:15:54.204 --> 1:15:56.182
Well, Shelby told me everything,
why don't you tell him?

1:15:56.206 --> 1:15:58.208
What?

1:15:58.241 --> 1:16:00.377
- Backstabbing bitch.
- Brother Avery.

1:16:00.410 --> 1:16:01.878
That's no way to talk to a lady,
now.

1:16:01.912 --> 1:16:04.514
Nah, that ain't no lady.
That's a conniving snake.

1:16:04.548 --> 1:16:06.192
- What are you talking...
- You know exactly

1:16:06.216 --> 1:16:07.117
what I'm talking about.

1:16:07.150 --> 1:16:08.494
I knew I should never
trusted your ass.

1:16:08.518 --> 1:16:09.753
I was just trying to help you.

1:16:09.786 --> 1:16:10.830
- Oh you tryin' to help?
- You...

1:16:10.854 --> 1:16:12.856
You did help, young lady.
You helped everybody.

1:16:12.889 --> 1:16:15.129
Now Avery, I know you're upset,
but the community center,

1:16:15.425 --> 1:16:17.894
yes, it's important to
the neighborhood and everything,

1:16:17.928 --> 1:16:21.798
but we need businesses
that's gonna generate income.

1:16:21.832 --> 1:16:23.476
That's what the people want.
And that's what the right thi...

1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:24.677
I'm not trying to
hear that shit!

1:16:24.701 --> 1:16:26.169
You don't care about
the community.

1:16:26.203 --> 1:16:27.504
All you care about is yourself!

1:16:27.537 --> 1:16:29.373
Oh, you know what, though?
You're right.

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:31.174
I do care about myself.

1:16:31.208 --> 1:16:32.848
Clearly more than you
care about yourself.

1:16:33.210 --> 1:16:35.579
I'm gonna to actually do
my thing and help my people.

1:16:35.946 --> 1:16:38.315
And not be a bitter,
washed up, could-have-been,

1:16:38.548 --> 1:16:40.360
who is mad that they're
still living in the hood.

1:16:40.384 --> 1:16:41.351
Oh, that's how you feel?

1:16:41.385 --> 1:16:43.105
Look, I used to look up to you,
Avery Watts.

1:16:43.854 --> 1:16:45.422
You had all the money,

1:16:45.455 --> 1:16:47.424
all the opportunities,
all the women.

1:16:47.724 --> 1:16:48.725
Look at you now.

1:16:49.826 --> 1:16:51.906
You're living check to check
at your grandma's house.

1:16:52.029 --> 1:16:53.339
You're a worthless piece
of shit, you...

1:16:53.363 --> 1:16:55.332
Whoa! Whoa!

1:16:55.365 --> 1:16:56.733
- Okay.

1:16:56.767 --> 1:16:58.268
Oh! You protecting him now?

1:16:58.301 --> 1:16:59.712
Huh? Y'all are perfect

1:16:59.736 --> 1:17:01.405
Get your hands off me!

1:17:02.372 --> 1:17:03.740
You did good, baby.

1:17:04.274 --> 1:17:05.942
Real good. Appreciate that.

1:17:06.144 --> 1:17:07.253
- Oh my...
- All right. All right.

1:17:07.277 --> 1:17:10.714
All right, everybody.
That's what we're doing now.

1:17:10.747 --> 1:17:13.316
We fighting for our city.

1:17:13.350 --> 1:17:15.619
Brother Avery,
you can't let the devil win.

1:17:15.652 --> 1:17:17.397
The city tried to take
the church from us too

1:17:17.421 --> 1:17:18.555
but we stayed fast.

1:17:18.822 --> 1:17:20.190
We kept the faith.

1:17:20.457 --> 1:17:21.758
We fought with love.

1:17:22.392 --> 1:17:24.895
Bishop, can you have a talk
with Avery?

1:17:25.328 --> 1:17:27.431
Well Avery, I can understand,
man.

1:17:27.464 --> 1:17:28.675
I can understand
how you're feeling.

1:17:28.699 --> 1:17:31.401
I can understand
the passion you have and...

1:17:31.435 --> 1:17:32.769
But now don't allow that passion

1:17:32.803 --> 1:17:34.538
just to become straight rage.

1:17:34.571 --> 1:17:36.807
The scriptures tell me that,

1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:38.408
he that keepeth his spirit

1:17:38.442 --> 1:17:40.410
is better than he that
taketh the whole city.

1:17:40.444 --> 1:17:41.745
This is about you, now.

1:17:41.778 --> 1:17:43.780
This is about
you controlling yourself.

1:17:43.814 --> 1:17:45.816
Not to make matters any worse.

No weapon formed against

1:17:49.187 --> 1:17:50.954
Now it's in His hands.

1:17:50.987 --> 1:17:52.489
So just be cool.

What do you mean, why?

1:19:54.811 --> 1:19:56.613
Because you need money!

1:19:56.646 --> 1:19:58.849
Plus, you can't be living

1:19:58.882 --> 1:19:59.883

Look, this is like basketball,

And I'ma be real with you.

1:32:08.078 --> 1:32:09.780
I ain't got no problem with you,
Black man.

1:32:10.147 --> 1:32:12.616
But I do got a problem with you
stealing from your own kind.

1:32:13.150 --> 1:32:15.118
Nigga, we don't steal, we take.

1:32:15.352 --> 1:32:16.787
That's exactly what you doin'.

1:32:17.087 --> 1:32:18.655
Taking these kids' future.

1:32:19.156 --> 1:32:21.458
You wouldn't want that
to happen to your own kids.

1:32:22.092 --> 1:32:24.194
And that's how I see these kids
in my neighborhood.

1:32:24.528 --> 1:32:26.129
They mine.

1:32:26.163 --> 1:32:27.883
And I can't let them end up
like I ended up.

1:32:28.231 --> 1:32:30.867

Buck Star.
This ain't even about me.

1:32:40.377 --> 1:32:41.712
It's about Tako.

1:32:42.713 --> 1:32:44.348
You know he got a future.

1:32:45.549 --> 1:32:46.683
Come on, man.

Don't play with me, ever.

Never again.

All right.
I'm looking forward to it.

1:33:16.513 --> 1:33:17.614
We'll see.

1:33:18.548 --> 1:33:19.549
Did he just bug at you?

1:33:20.751 --> 1:33:21.761
<i>The sun's going down
