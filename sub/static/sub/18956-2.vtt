WEBVTT

00:30.091 --> 00:33.841
- I dreamt I didn't
recognize him last night.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.745
What if it's a sign?

00:51.217 --> 00:53.074
We didn't leave on the best of terms.

00:53.074 --> 00:56.824
- I suspect it's all a
distant memory by now.

01:11.706 --> 01:13.487
All right, boys.

01:13.487 --> 01:14.446
All right, Bobby.

01:14.446 --> 01:16.113
All right.

01:19.535 --> 01:20.618
- Let me see.

01:22.245 --> 01:23.153
There.

01:23.153 --> 01:23.986
All done.

01:26.505 --> 01:28.088
You look beautiful.

01:38.783 --> 01:41.283
- Just all the worry and pain.

01:43.663 --> 01:44.514
If you'd have told me I'd be

01:44.514 --> 01:47.505
about to watch him in the World Cup Final.

01:47.505 --> 01:48.338
- I know.

01:54.123 --> 01:55.335
We'll have none of this.

01:55.335 --> 01:56.168
All right?

02:04.267 --> 02:07.184
- Tina, I know something's been up.

02:08.969 --> 02:11.136
I'm just glad it's passed.

02:15.339 --> 02:16.589
- Right, girls.

02:29.848 --> 02:32.931
- It's just a game of football, lads.

02:34.598 --> 02:37.598
England! England! England!

02:44.441 --> 02:45.654
Do your best.

02:45.654 --> 02:47.454
England!

02:47.454 --> 02:48.926
- Do your best.

02:48.926 --> 02:50.426
England!

02:54.835 --> 02:57.668
- We're all looking to you, Bobby.

02:59.249 --> 03:00.945
- Let's go.

03:17.836 --> 03:18.669
- Woo-hoo!

03:42.441 --> 03:44.524
Number six.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.334
- Roberta's just gone down for a nap.

03:48.334 --> 03:49.182
What have I missed?

03:49.182 --> 03:50.366
Anything?

03:50.366 --> 03:53.584
The ground
in many places is soft,

03:53.584 --> 03:57.084
but the 1966 World Cup final is under way.

03:58.475 --> 04:02.064
The ground is at its softest
at the goal mouth to our left.

04:02.064 --> 04:03.155
- Ooh!

04:03.155 --> 04:05.137
- Robert's roses need pruning.

04:05.137 --> 04:05.970
- Doss?

04:09.718 --> 04:12.118
- Well, they won't do themselves.

04:13.990 --> 04:14.899
- Come on, boys!

04:14.899 --> 04:15.977
- Come on, boys!

04:15.977 --> 04:17.227
Come on, Bobby!

04:24.840 --> 04:25.923
- Oh no!
- No.

04:35.257 --> 04:36.299
- Ref!

04:36.299 --> 04:38.505
- He he kicked him!

04:38.505 --> 04:39.338
- Come on, Bobby.

04:39.338 --> 04:42.739
rising, got my feet on the floor

04:42.739 --> 04:44.136
Moore with the free kick.

04:44.136 --> 04:46.085
In goes Hurst and it's the equalizer!

04:49.001 --> 04:51.599
A brilliant piece of football
there by Bobby Moore,

04:51.599 --> 04:52.799
who looks in with a chance.

05:04.312 --> 05:06.472
- Come on, boy!
- I don't believe it!

05:06.472 --> 05:07.972
- What time is it?

05:10.044 --> 05:11.556
Oh, this he must do!

05:11.556 --> 05:12.809
- No!

05:12.809 --> 05:14.414
Weber has
scored in the last seconds.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.247
- No!

05:22.261 --> 05:26.593
They have another 30 minutes.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.914
- Another 30 minutes of this!

05:27.914 --> 05:30.222
- Can you imagine how they feel?

05:30.222 --> 05:31.600
- Do you reckon I'll have
time to go to the loo?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.433
- No.

05:45.832 --> 05:47.504
- Look at them.

05:47.504 --> 05:48.482
They're flat on their backs.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.432
Now, come on!

05:49.432 --> 05:51.056
Get to your feet.

05:51.056 --> 05:51.889
- Come on, lads.

05:51.889 --> 05:52.722
You heard the man.

05:52.722 --> 05:54.941
- Don't let them see you're tired.

05:54.941 --> 05:58.266
You've won it once.
- England! England!

05:58.266 --> 06:00.349
Just got to win it again.

06:02.181 --> 06:03.224
Come on, boys!

06:12.122 --> 06:13.262
- We've got half an hour.

06:13.262 --> 06:14.629
I mean, they could do it.

06:14.629 --> 06:15.504
- Of course they will.

06:15.504 --> 06:16.337
They'll do it.

06:16.337 --> 06:17.539
- Come on, Bobby.

06:17.539 --> 06:18.841
Come on.

06:18.841 --> 06:19.674
Off they go.

06:19.674 --> 06:20.686
15 minutes each way.

06:20.686 --> 06:22.690
- Doss, you're missing it!

06:28.096 --> 06:29.920
Here's Paul,
running himself down.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.447
- Go on, Alan, go!

06:31.447 --> 06:32.364
I love you!

06:35.787 --> 06:37.250
Here's Hurst, can he do it?

06:37.250 --> 06:38.798
He's done it, yes!

06:42.370 --> 06:44.287
- Well done, babe, woo-hoo!

06:44.287 --> 06:45.454
- Oh, come on!

06:47.956 --> 06:49.112
Yes!

06:49.112 --> 06:50.718
No, no, the linesman says no.

06:50.718 --> 06:51.551
- What?

06:51.551 --> 06:52.384
The linesman

06:52.384 --> 06:53.884
says no.
Give it!

06:54.742 --> 06:57.492
In! In! In! In! In! In!

07:01.865 --> 07:03.634
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

07:03.634 --> 07:05.762
Oh, oh, to the left.

07:05.762 --> 07:06.950
Left, left.

07:06.950 --> 07:07.783
Back a bit.

07:07.783 --> 07:08.954
Back, back.

07:08.954 --> 07:10.653
- Back, there.
- It's three-two.

07:17.316 --> 07:18.149
- Come on, Bobby.

07:18.149 --> 07:20.520
- Come on, Bobby.
- Come on, Bobby.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.020
- Bobby, clear it!

07:23.217 --> 07:24.072
- Pass it.

07:24.072 --> 07:24.905
Come on.

07:30.026 --> 07:33.315
'cause the place is on fire

07:36.194 --> 07:37.697
buddy everybody should

07:37.697 --> 07:38.579
And here comes Hurst.

07:38.579 --> 07:40.717
He's got, some people are on the pitch,

07:40.717 --> 07:42.550
they think it's all over.

07:42.550 --> 07:43.502
It is now!

07:43.502 --> 07:44.566
Come on.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.972
Oh, it was wonderful.

08:06.899 --> 08:08.032
- They've done it?

08:08.032 --> 08:09.115
He's done it!

08:11.188 --> 08:12.695
Was Bobby good?

08:12.695 --> 08:13.970
- Brilliant.

08:13.970 --> 08:14.915
- Oh!

08:14.915 --> 08:17.090
Greatest moment
in English sporting history

08:17.090 --> 08:21.090
as Bobby Moore goes up
to pick up the World Cup.

08:36.997 --> 08:37.830
- Ohh!

08:41.282 --> 08:44.418
There is
the Jules Rimet trophy!

08:47.113 --> 08:48.696
What a day this is.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.730
A day none of us British
here will ever forget.

08:52.730 --> 08:53.563
- Bobby!

08:54.543 --> 08:57.991
This is a great sight.

09:07.924 --> 09:09.294
- Well done, chaps.

09:09.294 --> 09:10.127
Cheers.

09:10.127 --> 09:10.960
- Plenty of beer upstairs.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.793
Enjoy yourselves.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.518
Bobby, well done.

09:17.275 --> 09:18.395
- Bobby!

09:18.395 --> 09:19.571
- Private party, sorry.

09:19.571 --> 09:21.582
- I'm Tina Moore, I'm Bobby's wife.

09:21.582 --> 09:23.149
- The dinner's stag.

09:23.149 --> 09:23.990
- Stag?

09:23.990 --> 09:24.955
- Sir Stanley.

09:24.955 --> 09:25.998
Lady Rouse.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.389
- Er, what about her?

09:27.389 --> 09:28.929
- FA wives are permitted.

09:28.929 --> 09:30.023
Players' wives are in the chop house.

09:30.023 --> 09:31.871
- No, no, I need to speak to Bobby.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.538
We always get together after a match.

09:33.538 --> 09:35.007
- FA rules are very strict.

09:35.007 --> 09:35.890
- This is ridiculous.

09:35.890 --> 09:37.303
We haven't seen our
husbands for over a month.

09:37.303 --> 09:38.499
- Yeah!

09:38.499 --> 09:40.446
- I'm sure you can hold on
for a couple more hours.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.696
The chop house is that way.

09:43.685 --> 09:46.186
- Honestly, the cheek of that man.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.790
- Well, just don't let it ruin your night.

09:48.790 --> 09:49.990
- Thanks.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.390
I just hate how snobby the FA lot are.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.525
And he can't stand them either, Bobby.

09:54.525 --> 09:56.877
We should be allowed to
celebrate with our husbands.

09:56.877 --> 09:58.963
- Martin tried to have my top off earlier.

09:58.963 --> 09:59.963
- What?

09:59.963 --> 10:01.553
What, you've seen him already?

10:01.553 --> 10:04.437
- Yeah, well, he sneaked in
my hotel room, didn't he?

10:07.523 --> 10:09.273
Not a chance, I said.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.043
- We did it, Teen.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.096
We did it.

10:35.162 --> 10:36.373
My heart's still going.

10:36.373 --> 10:39.456
Mine too.

10:40.583 --> 10:41.666
- What is it?

10:43.702 --> 10:44.535
Tina?

10:53.511 --> 10:55.253
- Who'd have thought it, eh?

10:55.253 --> 10:58.086
East-End boy, son of a gas fitter.

10:59.031 --> 11:01.480
- You looked so handsome.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.871
Like a god.

11:02.871 --> 11:03.922
- Tina, you're embarrassing me.

11:03.922 --> 11:05.172
- I don't care.

11:06.762 --> 11:08.502
Everyone was watching.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.242
The whole country.

11:10.242 --> 11:11.659
Cheering for you.

11:13.183 --> 11:14.516
- Still just me.

11:15.459 --> 11:17.376
- You're a hero, Bobby.

11:18.328 --> 11:21.661
And they don't even know the half of it.

11:23.820 --> 11:25.320
- I've missed you.

11:27.871 --> 11:29.621
Bobby! Bobby!

11:32.671 --> 11:34.039
- You're wanted.

11:34.039 --> 11:35.035
Go on.

11:35.035 --> 11:37.368
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

11:42.626 --> 11:43.465
- Why don't you come with me?

11:43.465 --> 11:45.798
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

11:48.563 --> 11:52.563
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

12:07.083 --> 12:08.294
- Did you watch the match?

12:08.294 --> 12:09.654
- Of course.

12:09.654 --> 12:11.425
- You must be proud.

12:11.425 --> 12:13.454
The West Ham lot put on a good show.

12:13.454 --> 12:16.635
- The national team has
nothing to do with me.

12:16.635 --> 12:17.763
Your new contract.

12:17.763 --> 12:18.745
Let's be realistic.

12:18.745 --> 12:20.865
The board won't let you leave.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.345
It's a three-year deal.

12:23.345 --> 12:24.762
Golden handcuffs.

12:27.394 --> 12:29.043
- Gold?

12:29.043 --> 12:30.876
That's not even brass.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.083
- What do you have in mind, Bobby?

12:34.083 --> 12:34.916
- Well.

12:48.843 --> 12:51.010
- And this is the kitchen.

12:52.454 --> 12:53.574
Hardly use it.

12:53.574 --> 12:56.025
Bobby gets so many dinner
invitations, I'm getting fat.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.694
- Don't be silly, you look great.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.403
Oh, look at this, Tina!

12:59.403 --> 13:02.083
I used a mangle when
you were Roberta's age.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.802
Ooh!

13:03.802 --> 13:05.218
- Hiya.
- Oh, hello.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.899
- Hi Pauline.
Are you all right?

13:06.899 --> 13:08.961
- Who's that, the maid?

13:08.961 --> 13:10.387
- Au pair, actually.

13:10.387 --> 13:11.220
- Oh.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.053
Mm.

13:12.053 --> 13:13.679
I thought the house looked tidy.

13:13.679 --> 13:14.929
And you've got five bedrooms!

13:14.929 --> 13:16.581
What are you gonna do with them all?

13:16.581 --> 13:21.233
- Well, one for when you come
to stay and well, who knows?

13:21.233 --> 13:22.066
- Oh?

13:23.221 --> 13:24.249
And what about?

13:24.249 --> 13:25.095
- Bobby?
- Mm.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.175
- You know what he's like.

13:26.175 --> 13:28.095
Can't get him to talk about it.

13:28.095 --> 13:30.481
- Well, talking is not gonna
get me a new grandchild.

13:31.314 --> 13:32.541
- Mum!

13:32.541 --> 13:33.943
- I've never seen so much grub.

13:33.943 --> 13:34.873
- Do you want me to take a turn?

13:34.873 --> 13:35.706
- No, no.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.407
Happy as Larry here.

13:37.407 --> 13:39.102
- Mum, you don't need to do that.

13:39.102 --> 13:40.234
- I don't mind.

13:40.234 --> 13:41.105
- We've got Pauline now.

13:41.105 --> 13:42.539
Sit down, relax.

13:42.539 --> 13:43.372
Thanks, Pauline.

13:43.372 --> 13:45.372
- Thank you, Mrs. Moore.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.214
- Bleeding hell, Geoff!

13:48.214 --> 13:50.020
Judith not feed you at home?

13:50.020 --> 13:52.210
- Cut the ribbon down the
butchers down the road from us.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.424
Got a nice bottle of
bubbly and the best part,

13:54.424 --> 13:56.876
free sausages for a year!

13:56.876 --> 13:57.709
- Really?

13:57.709 --> 13:59.556
- Yeah, and I'm thinking
of becoming a vegetarian.

14:02.556 --> 14:04.326
- If Geoff's getting offers like that,

14:04.326 --> 14:06.764
imagine what you would get.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.310
- Would it be all right if I take a photo

14:08.310 --> 14:09.780
with the house in the background?

14:09.780 --> 14:10.898
- Of course.
- Yeah.

14:10.898 --> 14:11.812
- Gather round, everyone.

14:11.812 --> 14:12.812
- Mum!
Photo!

14:14.122 --> 14:15.740
Come on, let's get in.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.406
Come on.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.276
Say cheese.

14:22.276 --> 14:23.608
Cheese.

14:23.608 --> 14:24.500
- And sausages.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.264
- Sausages!

14:26.264 --> 14:27.440
- Tina's right.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.068
If you put that mush on a can of dog food

14:29.068 --> 14:30.830
and they'll fly off the shelves.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.390
You're a walking gold mine, Bobby.

14:32.390 --> 14:33.320
Shut up.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.453
- So, is this your field, then?

14:34.453 --> 14:35.870
Commercial management?

14:35.870 --> 14:38.938
- Trust me, Tina, I've got
contacts all over the country.

14:38.938 --> 14:42.298
Mate of mine works at
Titbits magazine, yeah?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.308
And he wants you to do a column.

14:44.308 --> 14:45.141
- Dunno.

14:45.141 --> 14:45.974
I'm not much of a writer, Jack.

14:45.974 --> 14:47.646
- Who said anything about writing?

14:47.646 --> 14:49.552
A quick chat with one of their
reporters after the match

14:49.552 --> 14:51.090
and he'll put it together.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.498
And then there's retail and, of course,

14:53.498 --> 14:55.712
celebrity appearances.

14:55.712 --> 14:57.528
Tina, that's where you come in,

14:57.528 --> 14:59.778
looking a million dollars on his arm.

14:59.778 --> 15:01.608
You think you can handle that?

15:01.608 --> 15:02.778
Silly question.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.568
- The thing is, Bobby's
been approached by IMG,

15:05.568 --> 15:06.401
which is a big American--

15:06.401 --> 15:07.496
- I know who they are.

15:07.496 --> 15:08.576
How much do they want?

15:08.576 --> 15:09.409
- Twenty per cent.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.116
- Of what they bring in, or everything?

15:11.116 --> 15:12.745
Football wages included?

15:12.745 --> 15:13.820
- Everything.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.229
- I'll only take ten

15:15.229 --> 15:18.237
and I won't touch your
deal with The Hammers.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.820
- That sounds good, doesn't it?

15:21.792 --> 15:22.625
- Yeah.

15:23.887 --> 15:26.738
- A bit more alive for me, come on.

15:26.738 --> 15:27.638
Yeah.

15:27.638 --> 15:28.920
Relax, Bobby.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.788
Yeah, that's it.

15:30.788 --> 15:32.244
Enjoy it.

15:32.244 --> 15:36.360
Why don't you drop your
shoulders a little bit?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.193
Yeah.

15:39.033 --> 15:39.866
That's it.

15:39.866 --> 15:40.751
Hands out of pockets, please.

15:40.751 --> 15:41.772
Thank you.

15:41.772 --> 15:43.272
One more of those.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.059
Try leaning up against
the trunk back there.

15:47.059 --> 15:48.392
There's the one.

15:49.487 --> 15:50.320
Look more alive for me.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.153
Come on.

15:52.063 --> 15:53.937
I've got enough wood with
all the trees, Bobby.

15:53.937 --> 15:55.835
- Come on, Bob.

15:55.835 --> 15:56.668
- What?

15:56.668 --> 15:58.168
- Loosen up a bit.

15:59.329 --> 16:04.175
TV Times, they want a bit of
pizzazz, you know what I mean?

16:04.175 --> 16:06.929
Let's try something else.

16:06.929 --> 16:07.762
Tina?

16:07.762 --> 16:08.939
- Yeah.

16:08.939 --> 16:11.321
- Why don't you stand next to Bobby?

16:11.321 --> 16:12.549
- Wearing this?

16:12.549 --> 16:13.382
- That's it.

16:13.382 --> 16:14.215
Perfect.

16:14.215 --> 16:15.048
Perfect, Tina!

16:15.048 --> 16:15.881
Wonderful.

16:15.881 --> 16:17.175
More of those, please, darling.

16:17.175 --> 16:18.789
Fantastic.

16:18.789 --> 16:21.626
You'll have to keep an eye on her, Bobby.

16:21.626 --> 16:22.514
Right, one more, folks.

16:22.514 --> 16:23.347
Thank you.

16:27.109 --> 16:31.527
- When Bobby comes back from
a match, he's always hungry.

16:31.527 --> 16:33.837
Nothing beats a proper Sunday roast

16:33.837 --> 16:37.489
with all the family and to top it all off,

16:37.489 --> 16:38.989
we swear by Bisto.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.647
It's so easy to make, I, oh.

16:43.647 --> 16:44.480
Bugger.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.339
Sorry.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.172
I'm sorry.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.005
All right, cut.

16:47.005 --> 16:47.838
Cut, thanks, everyone.

16:47.838 --> 16:52.005
Let's all take five and we can
get a reset on Tina, please.

16:54.352 --> 16:55.972
- Fanny Craddock, eat your heart out.

16:55.972 --> 16:56.805
- Ssh!

16:56.805 --> 16:57.792
- Now, now, Mr Moore.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.542
Don't upset our star.

17:00.596 --> 17:02.684
- I'm sorry, I'm out of practice.

17:02.684 --> 17:03.665
- Don't blame you.

17:03.665 --> 17:04.956
Not every woman wants to spend her life

17:04.956 --> 17:06.706
slaving in a kitchen.

17:20.412 --> 17:22.673
Oh, wow.

17:22.673 --> 17:23.980
It's got a pool.

17:23.980 --> 17:24.813
- Well, you need it in Spain.

17:24.813 --> 17:26.193
The heat's crazy.

17:26.193 --> 17:28.050
- That man looks just like Sean Connery.

17:28.050 --> 17:28.883
- It is.

17:28.883 --> 17:29.775
He has the place next door.

17:29.775 --> 17:30.862
- James Bond is your neighbor?

17:31.695 --> 17:32.528
I'm getting used to it now.

17:32.528 --> 17:33.361
What's he like?

17:33.361 --> 17:34.486
Bet he's a real lady's man.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.326
- Oh, he's lovely.

17:35.326 --> 17:37.440
Really down to earth
and he dotes on Roberta.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.918
- Can you get me an autograph
for John's birthday?

17:38.918 --> 17:40.835
He's mad on James Bond.

17:42.368 --> 17:43.469
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

17:43.469 --> 17:44.302
- No, no, it's fine.

17:44.302 --> 17:46.717
He's there on holiday you
know, to get away from it all.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.638
- Of course, of course.

17:48.638 --> 17:49.996
- We'd love you and John to come out.

17:49.996 --> 17:50.829
Who knows?

17:57.398 --> 18:00.294
Is that what I think it is?

18:00.294 --> 18:01.946
Congratulations!

18:01.946 --> 18:03.026
Why didn't you say?

18:03.026 --> 18:04.998
- I was going to, just
waiting for the right moment.

18:04.998 --> 18:07.270
- Aw Jenny, it's gorgeous.

18:07.270 --> 18:08.906
So, when did it happen?

18:08.906 --> 18:09.739
- Not long.

18:09.739 --> 18:11.072
Couple of weeks.

18:12.108 --> 18:12.941
- Weeks?

18:13.982 --> 18:14.815
Jen?

18:14.815 --> 18:15.648
- I haven't seen you.

18:15.648 --> 18:16.481
- You could have rung.

18:16.481 --> 18:17.314
- I did.

18:17.314 --> 18:20.066
Bobby said you were
busy doing that advert.

18:20.066 --> 18:20.899
- Oh, thanks.

18:20.899 --> 18:21.732
I'll get this.

18:21.732 --> 18:22.565
- No, let's split it.

18:22.565 --> 18:23.483
- No, Jen, please.

18:23.483 --> 18:25.816
- Really, Tina, I've got it.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.190
Sorry, could I trouble you

18:28.190 --> 18:29.573
for an autograph, Mrs. Moore?

18:29.573 --> 18:30.406
- Yeah.

18:30.406 --> 18:31.239
Thanks.

18:31.239 --> 18:32.124
- What's your name?

18:32.124 --> 18:33.026
Harriet.

18:33.026 --> 18:34.692
- Harriet.

18:39.494 --> 18:40.327
There you go.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.160
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:44.746 --> 18:47.582
- Well John, a couple more of both of us

18:47.582 --> 18:51.165
and then one of Bobby,
yeah, to finish off.

18:52.096 --> 18:52.929
There we go.

18:52.929 --> 18:54.346
That's it, folks.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.633
- Fall down a rabbit hole?

18:57.633 --> 18:58.466
- Sorry.

18:58.466 --> 18:59.514
Traffic.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.591
- Jack's got some news for you.

19:01.591 --> 19:03.520
- Yeah, so I got a call yesterday.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.384
It's only Alfred bloody
Hitchcock, himself.

19:06.384 --> 19:08.042
He's looking for a new blonde.

19:08.042 --> 19:09.630
- Must've seen your Bisto ad.

19:09.630 --> 19:10.793
- You're kidding?

19:10.793 --> 19:12.730
What did you say?

19:12.730 --> 19:14.253
Does he know I've not done any acting?

19:14.253 --> 19:16.550
I mean, not prop--

19:16.550 --> 19:17.883
Oh! Oh, you sod!

19:19.316 --> 19:21.342
- It was Bobby's idea.

19:21.342 --> 19:23.606
I'll get you a drink.

19:25.856 --> 19:27.476
- Well, I have some news.

19:27.476 --> 19:29.194
I don't think you deserve it now.

19:29.194 --> 19:30.294
- What?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.127
- No.

19:32.174 --> 19:33.507
- Come on, what?

19:39.486 --> 19:40.319
- No.

19:40.319 --> 19:41.308
- Yeah.

19:41.308 --> 19:42.141
That's why I'm late.

19:42.141 --> 19:43.436
I've been to see Dr Kennedy.

19:43.436 --> 19:46.769
I suspected, but I needed to be certain.

19:48.734 --> 19:51.028
Aren't you pleased?

19:51.028 --> 19:51.861
- Pleased?

19:53.084 --> 19:56.584
Tina, I'm--

19:57.549 --> 20:01.716
Here's another
one from Moore to Sissons.

20:04.051 --> 20:06.100
Go on, Bobby!

20:06.100 --> 20:10.254
- Ooooh!

20:10.254 --> 20:11.525
- Oh, God.

20:11.525 --> 20:13.429
Oh, God! Oh, God!

20:13.429 --> 20:15.045
Oh God!

20:15.045 --> 20:15.878
- Exactly.

20:15.878 --> 20:17.231
Never a foul.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.551
- Okay.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.551
And breathe.

20:21.542 --> 20:22.542
Really push!

20:23.447 --> 20:24.280
Help me!

20:25.113 --> 20:25.946
It's better you wait outside.

20:25.946 --> 20:28.496
- No, I wanna be right here this time.

20:28.496 --> 20:29.329
You all right?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.609
- What do you think?

20:31.711 --> 20:32.544
- All right, Tina.

20:32.544 --> 20:33.590
Push.

20:33.590 --> 20:34.423
- You can do it.

20:34.423 --> 20:35.256
Come on.

20:35.256 --> 20:36.089
Really, really push now.

20:36.089 --> 20:36.922
Come on, Tina.

20:36.922 --> 20:37.974
And breathe!

20:37.974 --> 20:38.807
Push!

20:38.807 --> 20:41.557
- Come on, put your back into it!

21:03.714 --> 21:05.214
- We've got a son.

21:07.168 --> 21:08.304
A son.

21:20.856 --> 21:23.068
Let's call him Dean.

21:23.068 --> 21:24.142
- Really?

21:24.142 --> 21:25.975
- Complete our family.

21:27.516 --> 21:28.599
I'm so lucky.

21:29.436 --> 21:34.215
- Usually it's the baby
who cries.

21:40.845 --> 21:42.975
Mum, we're back!

21:42.975 --> 21:45.765
Tina, do you want a G and T?

21:45.765 --> 21:46.932
- Great party.

21:48.705 --> 21:49.673
You all right, Mum?

21:49.673 --> 21:50.506
- Yeah.

21:57.601 --> 21:58.684
Angels, Tina.

22:00.390 --> 22:02.169
They're little angels.

22:02.169 --> 22:03.683
- I'm lucky, aren't I?

22:03.683 --> 22:06.669
Two gorgeous men in my life.

22:06.669 --> 22:09.068
- I saw Mother earlier.

22:09.068 --> 22:10.389
- Nanny Wilde?

22:10.389 --> 22:11.222
- Yeah.

22:11.222 --> 22:12.091
- In a dream?

22:12.091 --> 22:16.755
- She was holding out
her arms, smiling at me.

22:16.755 --> 22:19.643
Tina? Drinks are ready!

22:19.643 --> 22:20.543
- Go on.

22:20.543 --> 22:22.599
Go on, you go downstairs, enjoy yourself.

22:22.599 --> 22:23.611
- Are you feeling all right?

22:23.611 --> 22:25.171
- Yeah.

22:25.171 --> 22:26.978
I'm just tired.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.479
I'm gonna go to bed.

22:28.479 --> 22:29.312
- Are you sure?

22:29.312 --> 22:30.145
- Yeah.

22:30.145 --> 22:31.062
I love you.

22:43.951 --> 22:45.855
- Oh, not you and all?

22:45.855 --> 22:48.571
We're all feeling it today.

22:48.571 --> 22:50.133
It's gone 10.

22:50.133 --> 22:50.966
Mum.

22:52.467 --> 22:53.300
Mum?

22:55.372 --> 22:56.205
Mum.

22:57.820 --> 22:58.653
Bobby!

23:05.950 --> 23:08.559
- I've spoken to your mother's consultant

23:08.559 --> 23:10.476
and the tests are back.

23:11.980 --> 23:15.063
They show a large tumor on her brain.

23:18.288 --> 23:19.504
I know it's a terrible shock,

23:19.504 --> 23:22.921
but there's no doubt about the diagnosis.

23:24.356 --> 23:26.936
- Well, will they operate?

23:26.936 --> 23:29.186
- I'm afraid it's too late.

23:31.846 --> 23:33.806
I'm very sorry, Tina.

23:33.806 --> 23:34.723
- How long?

23:35.778 --> 23:36.730
Months?

23:36.730 --> 23:37.563
A year?

23:39.004 --> 23:39.837
- Days.

23:41.148 --> 23:41.981
- Days!

23:54.694 --> 23:55.527
Mum?

24:01.070 --> 24:02.237
- Oh, darling.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.292
Bobby, come here.

24:12.095 --> 24:15.374
I always knew you were special,

24:15.374 --> 24:18.874
from the first time Tina brought you home.

24:19.874 --> 24:23.015
So you will take care of her?

24:23.015 --> 24:25.182
- Of course I will, Betty.

24:30.696 --> 24:31.529
- Tina.

24:35.690 --> 24:38.023
I don't know what I ever did

24:39.906 --> 24:43.406
to deserve a daughter as wonderful as you.

24:44.390 --> 24:46.640
You've given me so much joy

24:49.734 --> 24:51.567
and so much happiness.

24:53.315 --> 24:54.648
Just, thank you.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.367
I love you, darling.

25:02.608 --> 25:04.025
I love you, Tina.

25:05.218 --> 25:06.976
- I love you, Mum.

25:41.537 --> 25:43.825
And this one's
going out for our brave boys

25:43.825 --> 25:48.153
on the England football squad
who today fly out to Colombia.

25:48.153 --> 25:49.727
How long
are you going for, Dad?

25:49.727 --> 25:51.033
That depends.

25:51.033 --> 25:52.757
Depends on what?

25:52.757 --> 25:55.427
On whether or
not Daddy's team win.

25:55.427 --> 25:57.760
We can't beat bloody Brazil.

25:59.703 --> 26:00.595
- Sorry, I'm.

26:00.595 --> 26:01.762
- That's okay.

26:03.047 --> 26:06.107
- I haven't been through
her things for ages.

26:06.107 --> 26:09.357
She used to wear this when I was young.

26:10.337 --> 26:14.170
She was always so
well-turned out, wasn't she?

26:15.393 --> 26:19.193
All the other women in the
street were jealous but,

26:19.193 --> 26:20.776
but I was so proud.

26:23.575 --> 26:26.575
I thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the world.

26:26.575 --> 26:27.408
I did.

26:33.085 --> 26:35.668
I should put them into storage.

26:40.007 --> 26:41.924
It still smells of her.

26:43.437 --> 26:44.900
I'm sorry, it's stupid.

26:44.900 --> 26:48.043
- Hey, it's not stupid at all.

26:48.043 --> 26:48.876
Hey.

26:54.660 --> 26:55.493
Er, hey,

26:57.770 --> 27:01.353
do you want me to ask
Mum to come and stay?

27:02.315 --> 27:04.647
While I'm in Bogota?

27:04.647 --> 27:05.480
Eh?

27:06.664 --> 27:07.497
While I'm training?

27:07.497 --> 27:09.080
- No, I'll be fine.

27:11.792 --> 27:15.625
I'll be joining you in
a few weeks anyway, so.

27:38.359 --> 27:42.526
waited patiently for you

27:51.516 --> 27:55.683
again tonight, my dear

28:02.198 --> 28:03.031
- Tina?

28:03.031 --> 28:03.864
- Mm.

28:03.864 --> 28:04.697
- Just a couple of things
I need you to sign.

28:04.697 --> 28:05.530
Is that all right?

28:05.530 --> 28:06.414
- Yeah.

28:06.414 --> 28:07.532
- There you go.

28:07.532 --> 28:08.365
- There?

28:08.365 --> 28:09.481
- And there.

28:09.481 --> 28:10.712
And there.

28:10.712 --> 28:11.545
- Sorry.

28:14.363 --> 28:15.340
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

28:15.340 --> 28:16.173
It's fine.

28:16.173 --> 28:17.020
Just one more.

28:25.962 --> 28:26.795
- We'd better get back.

28:26.795 --> 28:28.595
Thank you very much.

28:34.322 --> 28:35.155
Gentlemen.

28:35.155 --> 28:39.322
again tonight, my dear

28:40.190 --> 28:43.354
And, er, at six o'clock, we--

28:43.354 --> 28:45.034
- Excuse me, Senor?

28:45.034 --> 28:46.738
You took our bracelet.

28:46.738 --> 28:48.297
- A bracelet?

28:48.297 --> 28:51.260
- Yes, my assistant saw
you take it from our shop.

29:01.766 --> 29:02.652
- Hello?

29:02.652 --> 29:04.309
Tina Moore, have you heard?

29:04.309 --> 29:05.428
Bobby's been arrested.

29:05.428 --> 29:06.590
- Oh, don't be stupid.

29:06.590 --> 29:08.059
He's in bloody Bogota.

29:08.059 --> 29:08.892
No, hold on--

29:08.892 --> 29:10.324
- Please, leave us alone.

29:10.324 --> 29:12.799
Hang on, no!

29:12.799 --> 29:14.008
Bobby! Bobby!

29:14.008 --> 29:15.233
- We've got to talk about this.

29:15.233 --> 29:16.564
I don't know what you're doing here.

29:16.564 --> 29:17.984
This is completely wrong.

29:17.984 --> 29:19.536
Bobby! Bobby!

29:19.536 --> 29:22.026
- Don't you worry, Bobby.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.486
Bobby, we'll sort it out.

29:30.183 --> 29:31.016
- Tina?

29:31.016 --> 29:31.849
- Tina!

29:31.849 --> 29:33.244
- Tina, is it true?

29:33.244 --> 29:35.390
Did Bobby
steal a bracelet for you?

29:35.390 --> 29:37.140
Just a few questions!

29:42.644 --> 29:45.769
- Concerns are growing whether
England Captain Bobby Moore

29:45.769 --> 29:48.830
will be released in time
for the Mexico World Cup.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.528
Even if he is, there surely
will be a question over his

29:51.528 --> 29:54.276
fitness having missed crucial training.

29:54.276 --> 29:55.976
And of course, the psychological

29:55.976 --> 29:57.563
impact of this ordeal

29:57.563 --> 29:59.146
remains to be seen.

30:02.041 --> 30:02.874
- Oh.

30:07.524 --> 30:09.672
Any news?

30:09.672 --> 30:11.454
- No, not yet.

30:11.454 --> 30:12.760
- I've brought supplies
for a couple of days.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.343
I thought I could sleep
in your spare room.

30:29.356 --> 30:30.422
- How was school?

30:30.422 --> 30:33.978
- Sally in my class said
Daddy stole a necklace.

30:33.978 --> 30:34.895
Is it true?

30:36.024 --> 30:37.774
- Of course it isn't.

30:39.482 --> 30:40.892
- Who's hungry?

30:40.892 --> 30:42.294
- Here, have a biscuit.

30:42.294 --> 30:43.794
- We've got some nice chocolate biscuits.

30:43.794 --> 30:44.829
Sounds good, doesn't it?

30:44.829 --> 30:46.832
Would you like a chocolate biscuit?

30:46.832 --> 30:47.665
- Hello?

30:48.708 --> 30:49.758
- Tina.

30:49.758 --> 30:50.860
- Bobby.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.428
Thank God.

30:52.428 --> 30:53.453
Are you all right?

30:53.453 --> 30:54.286
- I'm fine.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.742
I'm fine.

30:55.742 --> 30:57.114
- What's going on?

30:57.114 --> 30:58.787
They're not telling us anything.

30:58.787 --> 30:59.620
- I don't know.

30:59.620 --> 31:00.453
It's crazy.

31:00.453 --> 31:01.763
I'm under arrest.

31:01.763 --> 31:03.737
- Why would they think
that you stole a bracelet?

31:03.737 --> 31:08.364
I don't know, Tina, right
I'm thousands of miles away,

31:08.364 --> 31:09.564
I don't speak the language,

31:09.564 --> 31:11.904
the team have gone off
to Mexico without me.

31:11.904 --> 31:12.737
- Sorry.

31:12.737 --> 31:16.442
I'm sorry, okay, just take a few breaths.

31:16.442 --> 31:17.874
- What if I don't get out?

31:17.874 --> 31:18.791
- You will.

31:19.785 --> 31:22.875
You've been through
worse than this, Bobby.

31:22.875 --> 31:26.064
A stupid bloody bracelet isn't
going to break you, is it?

31:26.064 --> 31:27.444
- Tina?

31:27.444 --> 31:28.277
- Hello?

31:30.016 --> 31:30.855
Bobby?

31:30.855 --> 31:31.688
- Tina?

31:42.053 --> 31:43.810
- I'm not staying here a moment longer.

31:43.810 --> 31:44.805
- What do you mean?

31:44.805 --> 31:46.450
- I'm no use to him here.

31:46.450 --> 31:48.285
The Daily Sketch has booked me a flight.

31:48.285 --> 31:49.118
I'm going.

31:50.184 --> 31:52.352
At least I'll be on the
same bloody continent.

31:58.388 --> 32:01.352
Oh! Tina! Tina!

32:16.806 --> 32:19.048
Tina! Tina!

32:19.048 --> 32:20.381
- Bye bye, boys.

32:24.434 --> 32:25.267
- Woo-hoo!

32:30.953 --> 32:32.351
Oh, Tina, come on.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.518
It'll be okay.

32:34.489 --> 32:35.322
It's just been announced

32:35.322 --> 32:38.013
that England Captain Bobby
Moore has been released

32:38.013 --> 32:41.291
without charge from
house arrest in Bogota.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.676
It is understood that he will now rejoin

32:43.676 --> 32:45.908
his team training in Mexico City.

32:46.741 --> 32:47.574
- See?

32:47.574 --> 32:48.407
- Oh, God!

32:50.355 --> 32:51.654
Okay.

32:51.654 --> 32:53.571
- Mexico, here we come!

32:55.203 --> 32:57.033
Bobby! Bobby!

32:57.033 --> 32:58.683
- All I wanna say is I'm
completely innocent of these

32:58.683 --> 33:01.555
accusations and now that I'm free,

33:01.555 --> 33:04.307
I want to concentrate on what's
important, the World Cup.

33:04.307 --> 33:05.140
Bobby!

33:05.140 --> 33:07.690
- Senor Bobby, are you
still fit enough to play?

33:17.404 --> 33:21.606
I thought I'd never see you again.

33:26.029 --> 33:28.063
- I've got to go.

33:28.063 --> 33:29.230
See you later.

33:42.395 --> 33:46.214
- Now Bobby has been proven innocent

33:46.214 --> 33:48.584
he's feeling confident again

33:48.584 --> 33:52.072
and the team is right behind him.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.564
- Bobby, over to you.

33:57.366 --> 33:58.470
- All right, lads.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.504
What we need to look out for
is when Rivelino falls back.

34:01.504 --> 34:06.284
- Of course, Alf is strict
about keeping the sexes apart.

34:06.284 --> 34:08.314
And so he should be.

34:08.314 --> 34:12.064
This is a serious business
and not a joyride.

34:13.952 --> 34:17.192
When thousands of people
are applauding him,

34:17.192 --> 34:21.359
I want to stand up and shout
he's my husband, you know?

34:27.280 --> 34:28.197
- Stop him!

34:29.460 --> 34:30.293
- Come on!

34:31.491 --> 34:34.961
Bobby Moore.

34:34.961 --> 34:38.647
I've seen him
play in many epic matches,

34:38.647 --> 34:42.230
but never as heroically as against Brazil.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.328
Bobby Moore.

34:48.328 --> 34:51.078
Bobby Moore is there to stop him.

34:54.046 --> 34:55.479
Moore is there!

34:55.479 --> 34:57.227
Here's Pele now.

34:57.227 --> 34:58.553
And Bobby Moore stops him.

34:58.553 --> 35:01.351
Pele was impressed
enough to kiss him and say

35:01.351 --> 35:02.851
Bobby, I like you.

35:03.979 --> 35:05.979
I like the way you play.

35:06.896 --> 35:09.044
Of course Bobby's
disappointed that England

35:09.044 --> 35:11.324
had gone out to West Germany,

35:11.324 --> 35:15.180
especially after such high
hopes of keeping the Cup,

35:15.180 --> 35:18.906
but that doesn't change
the fact that in my eyes,

35:18.906 --> 35:21.894
he's more of a hero than ever.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.465
Hey, chin up.

35:44.756 --> 35:46.512
- I still feel it in my guts, I mean--

35:46.512 --> 35:47.426
- Yes.

35:47.426 --> 35:49.848
But you played magnificently.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.577
Honestly, the papers are full of praise.

35:52.577 --> 35:55.542
Especially for the game against Brazil.

35:55.542 --> 35:58.959
- When I played, what was it, heroically?

36:00.204 --> 36:01.757
You read it?

36:01.757 --> 36:03.328
What did you think?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.161
- Great.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.013
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:05.013 --> 36:07.978
You really, really captured it.

36:07.978 --> 36:09.604
- Mm.

36:09.604 --> 36:11.818
- Hope it wasn't too
much of a drag for you.

36:11.818 --> 36:13.235
- No, not at all.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.668
Funny, I thought it might
be, but I really enjoyed it.

36:17.668 --> 36:19.220
I got a kick out of it,

36:19.220 --> 36:20.360
having something else to think about,

36:20.360 --> 36:24.527
other than what I'm wearing
or where I'm going for dinner.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.118
- So are we looking at the next Lois Lane?

36:27.118 --> 36:28.354
- Hardly.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.604
But it was nice while it lasted.

36:30.604 --> 36:31.918
- I'm glad.

36:31.918 --> 36:35.164
You look like your old self again.

36:35.164 --> 36:36.724
And we can have a proper holiday.

36:36.724 --> 36:38.098
- Yes.

36:38.098 --> 36:40.181
Well I got you a present.

36:42.889 --> 36:43.722
Yeah.

36:47.112 --> 36:47.945
Go on.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.504
- Is this a joke?

36:57.445 --> 36:58.278
- Yeah.

36:58.278 --> 36:59.361
- A bracelet.

37:00.398 --> 37:01.417
You!

37:23.542 --> 37:24.697
- Bobby.

37:24.697 --> 37:25.530
- Hm?

37:29.421 --> 37:32.827
- Sorry for the abruptness
of this intrusion,

37:32.827 --> 37:35.930
but we felt it was important
to speak to you straightaway.

37:35.930 --> 37:39.141
According to the source,
five men, two of them armed,

37:39.141 --> 37:41.849
are involved in a plot to kidnap
Mrs. Moore and the children

37:41.849 --> 37:44.349
for a ransom of 10,000 pounds.

37:48.508 --> 37:50.445
Now we're taking this
threat very seriously,

37:50.445 --> 37:52.875
so we'd like to put in place
round-the-clock protection

37:52.875 --> 37:54.255
for you and the family.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.437
There'll be nine officers,
working in threes,

37:56.437 --> 37:58.027
in eight-hour shifts.

37:58.027 --> 37:58.860
- Thank you.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.349
That's a huge relief.

38:01.349 --> 38:03.239
- Where will you stay?

38:03.239 --> 38:05.572
- Here with you, Mrs. Moore.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.001
What's it gonna be Bobby?

38:10.001 --> 38:10.961
Poker?

38:10.961 --> 38:11.945
Yeah.

38:11.945 --> 38:14.037
I knew I had some cards in here somewhere.

38:14.037 --> 38:15.506
- Lagers are here, Bobby!

38:15.506 --> 38:16.339
- Nice one.

38:16.339 --> 38:17.172
Be down in a minute.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.626
- You've been drinking all day.

38:18.626 --> 38:19.459
- Yeah, so?

38:19.459 --> 38:21.215
- So, what will Ron say
when you turn up drunk?

38:21.215 --> 38:22.091
Hm?

38:22.091 --> 38:24.987
- Has he got you on the payroll?

38:24.987 --> 38:26.143
Did you find the whisky?

38:26.143 --> 38:27.109
Yeah, I've got it.

38:31.355 --> 38:32.737
- Hello?

38:32.737 --> 38:33.570
Kathy, hi.

38:33.570 --> 38:34.403
One minute.

38:34.403 --> 38:36.193
Stay there one minute.

38:36.193 --> 38:39.110
It's all right, it's just a friend.

38:40.199 --> 38:41.489
They've got to listen in.

38:41.489 --> 38:43.911
Well, yeah, that's what they say.

38:43.911 --> 38:44.744
Hiya.

38:46.423 --> 38:47.256
Bobby?

38:49.086 --> 38:49.919
Roberta?

38:54.133 --> 38:55.807
Where are they?

38:55.807 --> 38:58.057
School finished 40 minutes ago.

38:58.057 --> 38:58.890
Bobby?

39:00.576 --> 39:02.421
Hello!

39:02.421 --> 39:03.606
- We got ice lollies!

39:03.606 --> 39:04.439
- Oh!

39:06.223 --> 39:07.122
You're late.

39:07.122 --> 39:08.759
You knew I'd be worried.

39:08.759 --> 39:09.592
Hey.

39:10.903 --> 39:11.736
- Go on, kids.

39:11.736 --> 39:12.569
Go upstairs.

39:12.569 --> 39:13.402
Go up and play.

39:13.402 --> 39:14.235
All right.

39:14.235 --> 39:15.402
Come on, Dean.

39:17.266 --> 39:18.430
- It's fine.

39:18.430 --> 39:19.263
They've caught the guy.

39:19.263 --> 39:20.624
It was a hoax.

39:20.624 --> 39:21.457
- What?

39:21.457 --> 39:23.040
- So it would seem.

39:24.218 --> 39:26.034
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

39:26.034 --> 39:27.046
- You were at the shops.

39:27.046 --> 39:28.617
- Anyway, I'm very
pleased to be able to say

39:28.617 --> 39:30.229
that we can now leave you in peace.

39:30.229 --> 39:31.622
Come on, lads.

39:31.622 --> 39:32.955
Good day, ma'am.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.269
- Well, I'd better get packed.

39:38.269 --> 39:39.102
- Packed?

39:40.309 --> 39:41.883
- Blackpool.

39:41.883 --> 39:43.466
FA Cup third round.

39:44.861 --> 39:45.694
- Right.

39:47.373 --> 39:49.445
- Hey, the police wouldn't be leaving

39:49.445 --> 39:50.571
if they didn't think it was safe.

39:50.571 --> 39:51.753
- It's not that, right.

39:51.753 --> 39:53.091
I want to be settled.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.581
I don't want to have police
and photographers here,

39:55.581 --> 39:59.127
and maniacs threatening to kidnap us.

39:59.127 --> 40:02.127
- Well, you can't have it both ways.

40:03.447 --> 40:06.114
- What is that supposed to mean?

40:07.117 --> 40:08.107
- Nothing.

40:08.107 --> 40:09.201
- It's all right for you.

40:09.201 --> 40:11.025
You can leave, hide in football.

40:11.025 --> 40:13.442
Me, me, this is all I've got.

40:19.041 --> 40:19.874
- Listen.

40:24.304 --> 40:28.137
Things will be back to
normal soon, I promise.

40:47.839 --> 40:49.745
So there I am, down to two men.

40:49.745 --> 40:51.665
Looking around to cross it.

40:51.665 --> 40:53.397
He's nowhere to be seen,
running up the left.

40:54.401 --> 40:56.675
- All right, lads, turn in soon.

40:56.675 --> 40:57.748
Big cup-tie tomorrow.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.557
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

40:59.557 --> 41:00.665
- Bobby.

41:00.665 --> 41:01.665
- Yes, boss.

41:04.821 --> 41:06.757
Right, fancy a nightcap, lads?

41:06.757 --> 41:08.008
Mate's got a club round the corner.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.658
- You heard what the boss said.

41:09.658 --> 41:10.978
- Don't worry about Reverend Ron.

41:10.978 --> 41:12.133
He won't find out.

41:12.133 --> 41:13.205
- But we've got a match tomorrow.

41:13.205 --> 41:14.038
- Oh, yeah?

41:14.038 --> 41:15.387
You seen the forecast?

41:15.387 --> 41:18.367
The only way we'll be
playing is on ice skates.

41:18.367 --> 41:19.415
Right, then.

41:25.327 --> 41:26.437
- Girls, come on!

41:26.437 --> 41:27.270
Come on.

41:27.270 --> 41:28.243
Do you want to meet Bobby?

41:28.243 --> 41:29.338
- Hello, Bobby.

41:29.338 --> 41:30.171
- Hi.

41:48.509 --> 41:49.828
- Hello, mate.

41:49.828 --> 41:51.621
Yeah, it's Jimmy.

41:51.621 --> 41:53.849
We might have a story on our hands.

41:53.849 --> 41:56.863
- Hammers trounced in
humiliating four-nil defeat.

41:56.863 --> 41:58.498
Hammers smashed.

41:58.498 --> 42:00.651
Astonishing indiscretion.

42:00.651 --> 42:03.583
Bobby Moore and West Ham get hammered.

42:03.583 --> 42:04.918
- I didn't think we'd be playing.

42:04.918 --> 42:07.409
- Not even Georgie Best
could've caused a bigger splash.

42:07.409 --> 42:09.193
Young players like Clyde
Best look up to you.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.107
I put my faith in you to
lead them out onto the pitch,

42:11.107 --> 42:12.223
not to the nearest bar.

42:12.223 --> 42:13.259
- Clyde didn't touch a drop.

42:13.259 --> 42:15.935
- Which is why he's not being punished.

42:15.935 --> 42:17.527
Well, what have you got to say?

42:17.527 --> 42:18.485
- Well, it's a disgrace.

42:18.485 --> 42:19.573
- Too right it is.

42:19.573 --> 42:20.406
Yeah.

42:20.406 --> 42:21.247
Club should've put a lid on it.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.080
Protected the players.

42:24.163 --> 42:26.497
- I just want you to know,
if it had been up to me,

42:26.497 --> 42:27.580
you'd be out!

42:28.799 --> 42:29.632
Right.

42:29.632 --> 42:30.667
Two week-suspension, a hundred quid fine.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.667
Now get out of my sight!

42:43.339 --> 42:44.172
- Okay.

42:48.577 --> 42:52.237
The first thing you need to know is

42:52.237 --> 42:56.404
yes, there were girls, but
nothing happened, right?

42:57.523 --> 42:58.356
I swear.

43:07.669 --> 43:08.502
Sorry.

43:10.086 --> 43:12.086
They've been in the car.

43:21.117 --> 43:22.200
Please, Tina.

43:24.561 --> 43:25.478
Talk to me.

43:29.585 --> 43:31.752
Shout at me, rage, scream.

43:38.945 --> 43:41.473
I don't know what you're thinking.

43:41.473 --> 43:43.806
- Now you know how it feels.

43:47.673 --> 43:50.256
I thought success, money, fame.

43:53.659 --> 43:55.992
I thought it can't touch us.

43:59.299 --> 44:00.466
We were solid.

44:01.385 --> 44:02.885
We knew our roots.

44:03.867 --> 44:06.320
- You have to believe me.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.143
I would never cheat on you.

44:08.143 --> 44:08.976
Never.

44:08.976 --> 44:10.491
- It's not even about that.

44:10.491 --> 44:11.658
It's about us.

44:12.681 --> 44:15.261
All the crazy stuff that's happened,

44:15.261 --> 44:17.435
I could deal with it,
if we faced it together.

44:17.435 --> 44:19.255
But instead you run off,

44:19.255 --> 44:21.422
hide in football and booze

44:22.483 --> 44:26.757
and I'm left here wondering
what it's all for.

44:26.757 --> 44:27.840
- I love you.

44:30.335 --> 44:31.668
- Are you drunk?

44:36.747 --> 44:38.195
Something's changed.

44:38.195 --> 44:39.445
You've changed.

44:41.271 --> 44:43.271
Drinking before a match!

44:44.185 --> 44:46.265
You'd have never have done that before.

44:46.265 --> 44:47.547
- I didn't think we'd be playing.

44:47.547 --> 44:48.714
- You gambled.

44:50.615 --> 44:53.115
You used to be so disciplined.

44:54.747 --> 44:57.343
Took pride in leading
your team out every week.

44:57.343 --> 45:01.510
Inspiring younger players,
not leading them astray.

45:04.153 --> 45:05.383
What's happened to you, Bobby?

45:05.383 --> 45:06.633
- I don't know.

45:13.317 --> 45:14.984
Itchy feet, I guess.

45:18.955 --> 45:19.788
Ron.

45:23.037 --> 45:26.787
Do you know, he never
once says, well played?

45:27.716 --> 45:29.367
Not once.

45:29.367 --> 45:31.903
That sort of thing would get to any man.

45:31.903 --> 45:32.756
Right, any man!

45:32.756 --> 45:34.423
- What about me?

45:34.423 --> 45:36.395
Where do I fit into all this?

45:36.395 --> 45:37.465
- What do you mean?

45:37.465 --> 45:40.603
You're my wife.
- Wake up, Bobby!

45:40.603 --> 45:43.103
Something's got to change or--

45:44.675 --> 45:45.508
- Or what?

45:48.861 --> 45:51.028
Tina, you don't mean that.

45:52.286 --> 45:53.961
I can make it up to you.

45:53.961 --> 45:54.794
- How?

46:00.027 --> 46:00.860
- Hey, no.

46:00.860 --> 46:02.341
- No!

46:02.341 --> 46:03.341
Not tonight.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.278
You're on the sofa.

46:22.688 --> 46:26.855
when you reach September
