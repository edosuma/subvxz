WEBVTT

02:21.750 --> 02:29.000
ON BODY AND SOUL

04:39.910 --> 04:41.870
You should come down...

04:42.250 --> 04:44.540
You'll see it can't be repaired.

04:44.620 --> 04:46.620
You never come down!

04:47.290 --> 04:50.040
You haven't been down in years.

04:50.620 --> 04:54.450
It's not your business,
but you are the boss...

05:26.250 --> 05:29.120
Keep a woman on a short leash
so she knows her place.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.120
You know what I mean. I'm no brute.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.830
But you need structure...

05:34.910 --> 05:39.620
Could you pick the kids up today?
I want to go out with the girls.

05:41.830 --> 05:43.290
You want to sit with us?

05:43.370 --> 05:46.000
I'm eating with the girls.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.000
Don't forget to get them, okay?

05:53.450 --> 05:54.950
Who's that?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.700
What? Who?

05:59.200 --> 06:02.540
That woman you hired today.

06:03.540 --> 06:05.750
Why wasn't she sent to my office?

06:05.830 --> 06:07.540
Oh, she's not an employee.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.160
She's the new quality inspector.
Bori's on maternity leave.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.120
She's already due?

06:12.200 --> 06:15.370
No, she's taking 2 months off
before the baby's born.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.370
So we've got this woman now.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.580
I'm not too happy about it.

06:19.660 --> 06:21.000
Why?

06:21.910 --> 06:23.250
She's pretty stiff.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.450
We might have problems with her.

06:28.450 --> 06:31.620
She talks like the slaughterhouse
came out of her shiny ass.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.120
Maybe she's just shy.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.370
First day and all...

06:39.790 --> 06:41.160
Maybe...

06:47.160 --> 06:49.540
See? Just what I was talking about.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.660
I'll check it out.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.160
Don't dare to call her Marika!
I made that mistake.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.790
Bon appétit.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.950
I'm Endre, the financial director.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.950
Mária Rácz, quality inspector.

07:44.370 --> 07:46.790
I see, you choose the garden sorrel too.

07:46.950 --> 07:51.000
It's the only good food here.
Not much else though...

07:55.450 --> 07:57.660
Except the shredded squash, maybe.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.950
I always have pottage here if I can.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.450
You know why?

08:02.580 --> 08:04.620
Perhaps because your arm is crippled.

08:04.830 --> 08:07.450
It's easier to eat mash with one hand.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.200
Look, Marika...

08:20.410 --> 08:22.870
May I call you Marika?

08:25.040 --> 08:29.620
Your friend surely mentioned... that I
find it unpleasant to be called that.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.200
Really? No. He didn't.

08:35.909 --> 08:41.200
Then I was wrong. Pardon me.
I find it unpleasant.

08:46.540 --> 08:47.700
Sorry!

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
Two?

09:16.290 --> 09:17.290
Yes.

09:19.950 --> 09:20.790
How much, Laci?

09:20.870 --> 09:21.950
875

09:29.500 --> 09:30.500
Thanks.

10:06.290 --> 10:10.790
Bon appétit! I'm Endre,
the financial director.

10:11.910 --> 10:14.580
Mária Rácz, quality inspector.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.370
She seems to be lonely...
that's why I came over here.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.660
I'm a bit scared. I don't
know what he wants.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.620
She must be nervous.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.620
I'll pick an ordinary topic.

10:34.620 --> 10:40.330
I see, you chose the garden sorrel too.
It's the only good food here.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.540
And shredded squash.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.790
And the shredded squash, maybe.
Not much else though.

10:49.370 --> 10:53.830
I should answer something now...
and then we'd be conversing already.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.620
Hey!

13:02.410 --> 13:03.660
Don't walk all over it!

13:03.750 --> 13:05.410
OK, OK, sorry.

13:06.950 --> 13:09.200
I'll get your coffee right away.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.290
I'm making yours in a sec!
You're in no hurry, right?

13:23.160 --> 13:24.290
Here you go.

13:31.330 --> 13:35.290
And he says it's not overtime!
Why on earth not?

13:38.290 --> 13:41.040
Look at her huddled alone in the dark...

13:41.330 --> 13:42.580
Should we ask her to join us?

13:42.660 --> 13:44.250
Their kind has coffee upstairs.

13:44.330 --> 13:45.830
Bori always had her coffee with us.

13:45.910 --> 13:47.450
That was Bori.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.080
Well, I'm asking her anyway.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.750
Hello, doctor!

14:33.160 --> 14:34.910
Hi, guys.

17:37.250 --> 17:41.160
I don't add salt, to keep it soft.
Only after.

17:42.370 --> 17:44.250
Józsi, this is Grade B?

17:44.330 --> 17:45.500
Fuckin' yes...

17:47.620 --> 17:49.750
I can't believe it!

18:29.620 --> 18:31.290
I work out.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.830
Three times a week.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.700
There won't be a problem with my strength.

18:39.120 --> 18:43.870
People always say... I should do
something with my excess energy.

18:46.290 --> 18:51.660
I'm not aggressive or anything...

18:53.330 --> 18:55.250
What else can I tell you?

18:55.870 --> 18:57.910
After my training I worked at...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.160
I'd like to ask you something, young man.

19:00.580 --> 19:01.370
What's your name again?

19:01.450 --> 19:02.580
Sándor Markó.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.700
Sándor, what do you think
about these animals...

19:06.790 --> 19:09.290
that we process here... so to say.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.830
I don't think anything.
What should I think?

19:14.910 --> 19:16.120
Don't you feel sorry for them?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.750
Not me. Bam!

19:19.950 --> 19:21.120
I see...

19:24.290 --> 19:25.700
Is there a problem?

19:27.290 --> 19:29.120
Blood never bothered me.

19:29.200 --> 19:33.410
Look, if you don't feel sorry for them...
that's not going to work here.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.000
You can't work here like that.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.870
So it was a trick question, right?

19:36.950 --> 19:40.500
If I say I feel sorry
for them, I'm neurotic.

19:41.410 --> 19:44.660
You'll have a breakdown.
Find some other job.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.450
So you're not hiring me? Is that it?

19:55.290 --> 19:56.370
Hello?

19:56.450 --> 19:59.830
This new chick is labeling
everything Grade B!

19:59.950 --> 20:01.910
These nice cattle!

20:02.160 --> 20:03.750
- I see.
- Should I talk to her?

20:03.830 --> 20:08.080
No, don't do anything!
I'll go down and talk to her.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.620
I'm not the HR manager.
You're already hired.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.410
It was just friendly advice.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.250
It certainly is cold here.

21:15.660 --> 21:18.250
So, how do you like working with us?

21:19.700 --> 21:21.830
Thank you, everything is fine.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.450
I won't beat around the bush.

21:30.540 --> 21:34.830
Look, the girls said...
you're labeling everything Grade B.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.450
The cattle seemed quite nice.
Don't you think?

21:39.580 --> 21:40.370
I do.

21:40.450 --> 21:43.160
Then what was the problem?

21:44.580 --> 21:47.120
They were fattier than regulation.

21:47.450 --> 21:48.910
Much fattier?

21:49.540 --> 21:53.080
No. About 2-3 millimeters on average.

21:53.660 --> 21:57.200
You've got hawk eyes. 2 millimeters...

21:57.580 --> 22:00.250
Yes, I have good eyes. I know.

22:00.790 --> 22:03.120
And that makes them all Grade B?

22:05.250 --> 22:07.870
That's what's in the regulations.

22:09.290 --> 22:10.750
The regulations.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.000
Oh, right.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.450
Yes, they are my guidelines.

23:25.290 --> 23:28.290
What's going on?
Did hell break loose down there again?

23:28.370 --> 23:31.250
Yes, two bulls need fast sedation!

23:31.580 --> 23:32.830
The paper from the doc?

23:32.910 --> 23:34.370
I'll give it to you later on.

23:34.910 --> 23:37.500
OK, but don't forget cause
they'll kick my ass!

23:37.580 --> 23:38.870
Sure.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.580
I'll have it sent up at
the end of the shift.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.450
Isn't she at her station?

23:43.540 --> 23:45.540
Second day and she's already no show?

23:45.620 --> 23:47.540
No, she's there.

23:49.410 --> 23:51.330
Sitting motionless... like this.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.830
Makes you feel real creepy.

23:53.910 --> 23:54.870
Then where's the paper?

23:54.950 --> 23:57.830
She started to fuss about.

23:57.910 --> 23:59.580
I got the fuck out of there.

23:59.660 --> 24:03.160
Here. But I didn't hear any of this.
Got it?

24:05.330 --> 24:07.290
Where'd they find this woman?

24:07.500 --> 24:08.700
Who knows?

24:08.790 --> 24:11.500
I invited her upstairs
for coffee yesterday.

24:12.580 --> 24:13.790
And?

24:14.700 --> 24:16.620
You don't see her anywhere, do you?

24:38.790 --> 24:41.660
Well, Snow White has arrived.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.370
Look, they froze up totally.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.370
I go to the hairdresser's today.
Can you pick up the kids?

25:03.750 --> 25:04.910
Sure...

25:06.450 --> 25:10.830
And we need groceries.
You can do both at once.

25:11.870 --> 25:14.410
Buy some pudding, for sure.

25:15.330 --> 25:17.330
- The powdered stuff?
- Yeah.

25:18.370 --> 25:20.370
And bread, milk, bologna...

25:20.450 --> 25:21.540
Write a list.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.660
OK.

25:23.290 --> 25:27.080
Oh, and we got a new quality inspector.
Maria something-or-other...

25:27.950 --> 25:29.580
Yes, that's her.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.200
You don't say.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.660
She is precise as hell...

25:39.120 --> 25:43.330
No, whoever you send us is fine.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.290
Okay, I'll tell her.

25:51.370 --> 25:52.790
We've got a problem.

25:52.870 --> 25:58.000
We have to hire two people
for the night shift.

26:08.370 --> 26:11.950
Looks like we've got
a new cock in the henhouse.

26:15.620 --> 26:18.290
You were a pole dancer...

26:25.330 --> 26:26.620
Look...

26:31.370 --> 26:33.580
He's met his match.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.700
I've come from the robotics department.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.620
So the good doctor will...

26:41.000 --> 26:42.700
stamp me.

26:43.580 --> 26:45.290
He's making a fool of her!

26:45.370 --> 26:46.870
So what?

28:55.750 --> 28:56.830
What's going on here?

28:56.910 --> 28:58.080
The cops are here.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.290
I can see that. So?

28:59.370 --> 29:02.410
I dunno... but I can only let employees in.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.120
Go upstairs, they're interviewing everyone.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.200
What did Pista say?

29:07.290 --> 29:08.410
The cops are here.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.370
Who are they after?

29:09.450 --> 29:10.870
How should I know?

29:11.660 --> 29:17.160
This is very awkward...
I have no idea who it might be.

29:17.330 --> 29:22.580
Not even a wild guess!
The cabinet was locked, as always.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.370
There's nothing more I can say.

29:25.450 --> 29:28.750
There's no point. It's full of prints.

29:29.580 --> 29:31.790
István, get the lady to the office.

29:32.330 --> 29:33.910
This way, please.

29:37.790 --> 29:38.950
Relax, it'll be fine.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.410
You got a tissue?

29:41.500 --> 29:42.620
No.

29:46.540 --> 29:48.160
Sorry about this...

29:49.040 --> 29:50.910
He's never been to a slaughterhouse before.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.580
Yes, one has to get used to it.

29:57.620 --> 30:01.250
Here's everyone who has access...
to the medicine cabinet.

30:02.080 --> 30:06.080
One of them is me.
It could have been one of us.

30:06.620 --> 30:09.120
What is this mating powder, anyway?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.750
Is it really that strong?

30:10.870 --> 30:13.330
It's strong, and works fast, too.

30:13.950 --> 30:16.870
A mating is done in 3 minutes.

30:17.790 --> 30:20.370
It's not so funny for us.

30:20.450 --> 30:23.040
I hope we can settle this quietly.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.450
A story like this? No way.

30:27.450 --> 30:32.700
That 50th class reunion, for example!

30:32.910 --> 30:34.540
Yes, it really does get
your instincts going.

30:34.620 --> 30:38.000
But jumping at each other
like crazed animals?

30:38.080 --> 30:39.830
It was developed for cattle.

30:39.910 --> 30:43.040
A bull weighs in around 400 kilos.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.830
Boss? Where should I...?

30:50.700 --> 30:56.000
A speedy result would be nice.
We don't want this to happen again.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.000
Are you feeling better?

31:04.790 --> 31:06.330
Uh-huh, thank you, yes.

31:06.950 --> 31:09.450
Do you have here mental hygiene screenings?

31:09.540 --> 31:12.410
Sure, every year. The
next one is in 2 months.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.450
Great.

31:15.950 --> 31:19.750
Has anyone's behavior changed recently?

31:20.080 --> 31:23.830
I mean, anyone acting weird? Unhinged?

31:24.160 --> 31:26.620
It's hard to tell from
up here in the office.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.830
Listen, run the annual screening now.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.700
Let me recommend someone.

31:31.790 --> 31:34.160
She's worked for us in the past.

31:35.660 --> 31:39.660
OK, but... who'll pay for the psychologist?

31:39.830 --> 31:41.410
Us, or...?

31:41.660 --> 31:43.950
Well, it's worth the price, right?

31:47.500 --> 31:50.290
The steak is in the striped bag.

32:08.620 --> 32:11.120
Well, are they satisfactory?

32:11.580 --> 32:13.000
Pardon me.

32:30.620 --> 32:33.040
Date of first seminal emission?

32:34.290 --> 32:34.910
Excuse me?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.620
Ejaculation.

32:36.700 --> 32:39.120
I'm sure you remember.

32:40.120 --> 32:44.200
Pardon me for my... staring before.

32:44.290 --> 32:45.620
No problem.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.540
It happens...

32:48.870 --> 32:50.200
Well?

32:51.410 --> 32:53.200
Is this really a question?

32:54.250 --> 32:57.580
Look, these are regulation questions.

32:57.660 --> 33:01.040
This is how you started
with the butcher boys?

33:01.450 --> 33:03.450
The question order is not set...

33:03.540 --> 33:04.620
Uh-huh.

33:05.410 --> 33:09.750
But yes, I asked them all
and they all answered.

33:09.830 --> 33:11.750
That must have been a real experience.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.080
I see you're embarrassed...

33:14.160 --> 33:16.040
I'm not embarrassed!

33:16.160 --> 33:20.290
Relax. There's nothing personal
in this question.

33:20.370 --> 33:23.200
It happens to all boys, no?

33:23.290 --> 33:26.080
Come on. Try and remember.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.950
Alright. I was 10. Next question?

33:32.040 --> 33:33.370
10...?

33:35.580 --> 33:37.290
It's a bit early.

33:37.620 --> 33:39.580
Are you sure?

33:40.250 --> 33:41.370
Yes.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.580
Fine...

33:51.330 --> 33:54.040
Tell me what you dreamt last night.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.250
It wasn't anything special.

34:01.910 --> 34:03.290
Yes?

34:04.870 --> 34:07.660
I dreamt that I was a deer.

34:07.790 --> 34:11.580
I don't know what you'll conclude
from that. Probably nothing.

34:11.659 --> 34:13.909
So you were a deer. And?

34:15.409 --> 34:21.580
That's about it.
I did things deer usually do, I suppose.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.120
Like what?

34:25.330 --> 34:30.199
I wandered around in the woods.
Drank from a stream. Stuff like that.

34:32.949 --> 34:34.370
Were you alone?

34:34.449 --> 34:35.659
No.

34:36.790 --> 34:40.909
I was with... there was another deer.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.580
Was it another stag? Or a doe?

34:45.830 --> 34:46.830
A doe.

34:47.870 --> 34:50.199
Are you certain or just assuming?

34:50.580 --> 34:51.409
I know.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.159
How? Did you mate?

34:57.120 --> 35:00.620
My dear lady, I have to disappoint.
We did not mate.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.660
We wandered the woods, looked for grass.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.910
But only found a few juicy leaves.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.410
We had to dig them out from under the snow.

35:09.870 --> 35:13.040
We went down to the stream, to drink.

35:14.450 --> 35:18.000
Our noses touched when we drank.
That's all.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.580
I didn't mount her, I didn't fuck her.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.160
And I don't want to mount you either.

35:24.250 --> 35:27.700
I just looked at you,
like any normal man would.

35:28.830 --> 35:34.290
Again, I apologize if I was insolent...
but I'd like to start the real work now.

35:34.370 --> 35:36.200
Of course. Sure.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.540
Your intense reaction is very interesting.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.120
Do you perhaps have any erection problems?

35:46.750 --> 35:48.450
Is this part of the questionnaire?

35:48.540 --> 35:50.660
Your response was so
heated it seems logical...

35:50.750 --> 35:54.120
You said you ask everyone
the same questions.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.620
May I ask you to adhere to this?

35:56.700 --> 35:58.080
Sure, sure...

35:59.950 --> 36:02.040
When did you lose your virginity?

36:02.450 --> 36:03.750
C'mon, tell me what they asked.

36:03.830 --> 36:06.410
I dunno. A bunch of nonsense.

36:06.700 --> 36:09.410
What's my favorite food...
or if I get dizzy spells...

36:09.620 --> 36:12.120
She also asked me what I dreamt.

36:12.830 --> 36:15.200
I'm not telling her that, for sure.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.120
I'll say I don't remember.

36:18.290 --> 36:20.500
She can't read anything into it.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.870
They know if you're lying. That's how
the questions are put together...

36:24.040 --> 36:25.540
And what's the woman like?

36:26.660 --> 36:28.580
She's got tits like this!

36:42.080 --> 36:43.580
So what did you dream, honey?

36:43.660 --> 36:44.500
I'm not telling.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.120
- No.
- Oh, come on.

36:48.330 --> 36:49.790
OK.

36:50.660 --> 36:52.080
I dreamt...

36:52.370 --> 36:54.870
I was sitting on a light-blue horse...

36:55.700 --> 36:58.450
Ha ha, really funny. Whatever, forget it.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.950
Too bad, it was nice.

37:01.910 --> 37:04.200
Tell us what you dream, Zsóka.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.410
You don't want to know that, honey.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.410
I just made a fool of myself for telling.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.160
What do you do in your dreams?

37:13.700 --> 37:14.700
Me?

37:15.790 --> 37:17.080
I fuck.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.370
So... time of first menstruation?

37:47.250 --> 37:50.290
November 5, 1998.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.410
Any surgery?

37:52.500 --> 37:53.580
None.

37:53.830 --> 37:55.160
Contagious illnesses?

37:55.250 --> 37:56.660
Chicken pox.

37:56.830 --> 37:57.950
When?

37:58.080 --> 38:02.700
March 21 - April 7, 1990.

38:03.290 --> 38:05.200
You remember so precisely?

38:05.500 --> 38:07.120
I remembered.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.290
I see.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.790
It's rather unusual.

38:14.540 --> 38:17.000
Is there some reason for it?

38:17.540 --> 38:18.700
No.

38:21.450 --> 38:24.750
OK. Tell we what you dreamt last night.

38:31.660 --> 38:33.160
You don't remember?

38:33.700 --> 38:34.910
I do.

38:35.250 --> 38:39.790
I'm just thinking of how to tell it.
I'll finish in a moment.

38:40.330 --> 38:41.540
Sure, fine.

38:53.790 --> 38:54.910
Please.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.290
Yes?

38:56.700 --> 38:59.540
It would be easier without this noise.

38:59.870 --> 39:00.950
What noise?

39:02.250 --> 39:03.250
Oh...

39:04.160 --> 39:06.700
Sorry. It wasn't nice of me.

39:07.370 --> 39:09.370
I've had a long day.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.750
But I'm really listening now.
Tell me your dream.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.000
I was very hungry.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.370
I rooted through the snow...
but there was no food anywhere.

39:23.910 --> 39:27.000
My companion helped me search.

39:29.410 --> 39:35.000
He found a thick, juicy
leaf under the snow.

39:36.040 --> 39:40.120
He let me have all of it. I ate it.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.000
It didn't taste bad...

39:46.830 --> 39:48.950
just a bit nauseating.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.200
Afterwards, I felt strange.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.910
Were you an animal in your dream?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.160
Yes.

39:58.790 --> 40:01.000
What animal? Can you tell me?

40:02.040 --> 40:03.500
A deer.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.330
Go on. What else happened?

40:15.580 --> 40:18.000
We went down to the stream.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.950
Your companion...

40:23.330 --> 40:24.660
Well...

40:24.950 --> 40:26.500
did you mate?

40:33.580 --> 40:35.200
Why don't you answer?

40:35.450 --> 40:39.290
I was just waiting for you...
to find what you were looking for.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.450
Did you find it?

40:46.330 --> 40:48.410
Yes, I found it. Thank you.

40:48.790 --> 40:49.910
So then?

40:50.330 --> 40:51.540
No.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.200
No, what?

40:54.370 --> 40:56.200
We didn't mate.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.660
Oh, right.

41:00.290 --> 41:03.700
But was there physical contact?

41:06.870 --> 41:09.080
His nose touched mine.

41:10.750 --> 41:13.950
Our noses touched when we drank.

41:15.290 --> 41:17.660
Tell me, why you're doing this to me?

41:19.370 --> 41:20.750
What, doctor?

41:22.500 --> 41:25.580
As you wish. Send the next person in.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.790
Oooh, they called you back in?

41:42.450 --> 41:45.500
Don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing.

41:50.450 --> 41:51.660
Relax.

41:52.660 --> 41:53.950
Stop touching me...

41:54.040 --> 41:56.080
Leave me alone. There's no problem.

41:56.250 --> 41:58.700
OK, forget I said anything...

42:24.750 --> 42:27.540
I want to know about your
little private joke.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.290
You think it's funny?

42:32.410 --> 42:35.250
I need to evaluate the material.

42:35.410 --> 42:38.790
And the dream analysis is a part of it. OK?

42:39.870 --> 42:40.660
Yes.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.870
Then tell me what you
really dreamt last night!

42:44.950 --> 42:47.290
Not what the two of you arranged.

42:48.540 --> 42:51.080
I'm just trying to do my job.

42:51.370 --> 42:53.700
I don't care about anyone's private life.

42:53.790 --> 42:56.290
I want to go home, take a shower.
That's all.

42:56.410 --> 43:01.410
Doctor, maybe you've overworked yourself?

43:02.790 --> 43:04.290
It happens.

43:06.870 --> 43:08.120
Alright...

43:12.540 --> 43:15.290
I dreamt that I was a deer.

43:15.450 --> 43:19.450
I don't know what you'll conclude
from that. Probably nothing.

43:19.700 --> 43:22.700
So you were a deer. And?

43:23.080 --> 43:28.330
That's about it.
I did things deer usually do, I suppose...

43:59.830 --> 44:01.750
What an odd coincidence, right?

44:05.700 --> 44:10.080
Anyway, I just wanted to say...
we don't have to feel awkward.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.790
We're adults after all, right?

44:13.660 --> 44:14.790
Yes.

44:17.330 --> 44:20.080
Actually, it's kind of funny, no?

44:21.080 --> 44:22.580
It's funny.

46:17.250 --> 46:18.750
Bon appétit.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.540
How's the meat?

46:33.450 --> 46:35.000
The meat is satisfactory.

46:37.080 --> 46:39.290
I always end up with leathery meat here...

46:39.370 --> 46:41.290
What did you dream last night?

46:49.120 --> 46:50.700
I didn't dream anything.

46:50.950 --> 46:52.120
Ah...

46:53.160 --> 46:54.580
Too bad...

47:01.120 --> 47:03.290
Then I'd better go sit elsewhere.

47:03.950 --> 47:06.450
I prefer eating alone.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.750
May I?

47:19.080 --> 47:22.120
Don't think I consider you a leper too.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.250
Did they find out who did it?

47:30.500 --> 47:31.700
No.

47:32.410 --> 47:34.040
Well, I've got a tip.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.450
Leave me alone.

47:36.540 --> 47:38.370
Personally, I don't think it's you.

47:41.500 --> 47:45.000
We'll see what that shrink
lady comes up with.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.660
She's a silly goose.

47:49.370 --> 47:51.500
She really messed with my mind.

47:52.660 --> 47:54.250
I'd bang her though.

47:58.750 --> 48:01.250
Don't you even want to know who I suspect?

48:03.160 --> 48:04.950
Tell me, I know you want to.

48:05.450 --> 48:06.620
Well...

48:07.040 --> 48:08.830
I think it's obvious.

48:09.370 --> 48:12.160
That guy Sándor...
I don't think he's got all his marbles.

48:12.620 --> 48:14.290
The way he's all over the women...

48:14.410 --> 48:16.750
And the mating powder and all...

48:20.450 --> 48:23.120
You see? He's a sex maniac.

48:26.870 --> 48:28.250
What do you think?

48:29.580 --> 48:31.120
Isn't it logical?

48:32.290 --> 48:34.660
Yeah, it's a good idea.

48:35.410 --> 48:39.620
Cause if you think so too,
we might want to tell the cops, no?

48:39.830 --> 48:41.580
Could you return my tray?

48:41.700 --> 48:43.700
You're the one in contact with them...

48:44.700 --> 48:47.910
Well, in my dream, I was a deer again...

48:48.040 --> 48:50.540
Like every night, for a while now.

48:53.910 --> 48:55.500
Aaand...

48:56.200 --> 48:58.290
There was this doe.

48:58.700 --> 48:59.700
Where?

48:59.870 --> 49:01.620
Well, in a forest. Where else?

49:01.700 --> 49:02.870
Actually...

49:05.750 --> 49:08.290
It really was kind of a strange place.

49:10.870 --> 49:13.120
Beside a small, round pond.

49:13.870 --> 49:15.750
I've never seen such a small pond before.

49:15.830 --> 49:17.830
I mean, in real life.

49:21.410 --> 49:22.750
How about you?

49:23.870 --> 49:25.830
What nice things did you dream?

49:27.080 --> 49:28.290
This.

49:29.080 --> 49:29.750
What?

49:29.830 --> 49:30.830
The same as you.

49:30.950 --> 49:32.370
You're just saying that.

49:32.540 --> 49:33.660
No.

49:35.660 --> 49:37.040
I don't believe you.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.330
That's okay...

51:22.250 --> 51:23.540
I wrote it down.

51:30.290 --> 51:31.580
Oh, sorry...

52:39.450 --> 52:40.410
Well

52:42.040 --> 52:44.160
See you tonight then.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.160
Tell me...

53:09.250 --> 53:10.870
Why did you run away?

53:11.040 --> 53:12.830
I looked for you at the lake too.

53:13.410 --> 53:15.000
Are you angry?

53:15.290 --> 53:16.580
Hello, doctor.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.790
You look really hot today.

53:19.160 --> 53:21.200
Looks like the boss thinks so too.

53:25.870 --> 53:30.120
Excuse me. Just a professional question...

53:43.250 --> 53:46.790
I bet your legs are...

54:28.620 --> 54:30.040
Coffee?

54:31.040 --> 54:32.950
May I come in just this once?

54:33.080 --> 54:34.580
No, you may not.

54:34.750 --> 54:36.200
Come on...

54:38.580 --> 54:40.620
You know that regulations forbid that...

54:40.700 --> 54:44.700
We'll just have our coffee... and I'm gone.

54:44.790 --> 54:45.910
Is that alright?

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
I just want to discuss something with you.

54:56.330 --> 54:59.450
You shouldn't take that
guy Sándor seriously.

55:00.790 --> 55:01.790
Okay.

55:02.370 --> 55:05.660
Men sometimes talk a load of nonsense.

55:05.790 --> 55:07.370
What did he say to you?

55:12.540 --> 55:15.000
Never mind. It's not important.

55:16.790 --> 55:20.160
Here is my phone number.

55:23.750 --> 55:25.750
And I will enter yours.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.290
I don't have one.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.120
I didn't mean to impose.

55:40.290 --> 55:44.290
I really didn't mean to impose.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.330
That's not how I am.

56:12.830 --> 56:14.290
And what did you say?

56:15.200 --> 56:16.870
That I have no phone.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.120
Uh-huh.

56:19.500 --> 56:21.250
So what's it supposed to mean?

56:22.120 --> 56:24.040
What do you think?

56:25.660 --> 56:28.790
Perhaps he didn't believe
me for some reason.

56:30.040 --> 56:31.410
Very good.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.750
And could you explain why?

56:35.200 --> 56:37.660
Maybe I used the wrong tone of voice.

56:38.290 --> 56:40.660
Or I forgot to make eye contact.

56:41.080 --> 56:44.750
No, I made eye contact, I remember.

56:44.830 --> 56:47.120
His pupils contracted.

56:47.250 --> 56:51.250
Look, these days, everyone
has a cell phone.

56:51.410 --> 56:53.330
Maybe that was the reason.

56:55.950 --> 56:58.330
It's strange to talk to you like this.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.200
Yes, Marika...

57:00.290 --> 57:02.620
You're a real, grownup woman.

57:02.700 --> 57:04.290
It's strange for me too.

57:05.120 --> 57:07.000
Maybe I could give you the number of...

57:07.080 --> 57:10.250
a colleague who works with adults.

57:11.950 --> 57:16.870
Or simply buy yourself a phone.

57:42.540 --> 57:43.750
Hello.

57:44.120 --> 57:45.790
You came down early today.

57:46.580 --> 57:48.040
Bon appétit.

57:49.370 --> 57:51.870
I'm buying a phone tomorrow.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.750
You have a phone...

57:54.120 --> 57:56.790
You just think I'm old
and my arm is crippled.

57:56.910 --> 57:58.500
It makes me feel bad.

57:59.830 --> 58:02.000
I think you are beautiful.

58:02.250 --> 58:03.700
I don't believe you.

58:05.370 --> 58:09.910
You can see in 3 signs, if someone's lying.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.700
Shall I teach you too?

58:12.330 --> 58:13.450
OK.

58:13.950 --> 58:15.290
Number one: The pupils.

58:15.370 --> 58:16.830
If the pupils dilate...

58:17.000 --> 58:21.370
Pupils dilate according to light changes...
don't try and make a fool of me.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.410
I know why you're angry with me.

58:24.620 --> 58:26.000
I'm not angry.

58:26.370 --> 58:27.830
Today I went to...

58:28.660 --> 58:30.410
Someone explained to me...

58:30.500 --> 58:33.370
I don't care what you discussed about me.

58:33.450 --> 58:35.200
You probably laughed at me.

58:35.700 --> 58:39.370
He said you are angry with me
because you're jealous.

58:40.910 --> 58:43.540
Is it true? Are you really jealous?

58:44.370 --> 58:45.540
Yes.

58:48.870 --> 58:52.370
I think you fancy that worker, that Sándor.

58:54.040 --> 58:55.370
You're mistaken.

58:57.700 --> 58:59.250
Come on!

58:59.370 --> 59:01.080
You're wrong. I'm afraid of him.

59:03.950 --> 59:06.200
Is that... true?

59:07.870 --> 59:09.040
Yes.

59:12.500 --> 59:15.910
Then everything's alright again, right?

59:19.870 --> 59:21.500
I'm totally stressed.

59:23.580 --> 59:24.750
Why?

59:27.870 --> 59:29.250
Uhh, forget it.

59:30.370 --> 59:31.500
Uh-huh.

59:37.870 --> 59:39.080
Listen...

59:40.950 --> 59:43.870
Back in the day, did you screw my wife?

59:44.410 --> 59:45.830
Christ.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.160
So you did.

59:54.620 --> 59:56.950
I know she's slept with half the factory.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.910
Sándor's on the agenda now.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.500
Oh, come on.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.290
I'm not a complete idiot.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.200
Whatever.

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:07.790
We worked through this already.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.700
You got an aspirin?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.700
Hello.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.580
You came down early today.

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.950
It's 1:30.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.790
I didn't come early.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.370
I'm buying a phone tomorrow.

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:33.330
Then buy one.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.910
I think you are beautiful.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:47.410
I can't believe this.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.290
What's going on? Did you hook up?

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.750
Are you crazy?

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.290
Why exactly do you have...
mating powder at a slaughterhouse?

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:27.750
Well, it's not really legal...
but not illegal either.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.200
Sometimes we help with mating...
private deals, no papers.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.620
But it's not a whole lot of money.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.620
It's not making us rich or anything.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.870
You can report it if you want.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.040
No way.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:47.540
Don't worry...
I just couldn't fit the pieces together.

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:54.750
The meat was really yummy...

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.950
Béla...

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.000
The usual.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.620
Hey, boss!

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:26.370
What did the cop want?

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.000
What are you doing out here?

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.700
Oh, you're my dad now? It's nice.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.200
Return to work. Don't make me say it again.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.540
What'll happen if you say it again?

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:40.700
Are you gonna beat me up?

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.870
Quit this job, son...
before you get into real trouble.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.580
What are you talking about?

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.410
I know you did it.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.750
You despise me from the start.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.290
You're right. Smart boy.

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:09.080
Dad, I don't ask you that often!

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.250
That's not what I said.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.830
What do you spend on besides smokes?

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.120
You never even have a
crust of bread at home.

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:21.830
I stopped smoking 4 years ago.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.870
All the more, then.

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:31.000
Listen, kid, that's my business.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.660
Look, the situation is this...

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:40.790
Will you get it?

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.750
Yes? Hello?

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.830
I bought a phone.

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:49.330
Is this a bad time?

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:50.700
No, it's fine.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.200
Would you call me tonight?

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:55.080
We could fall asleep together.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.120
Well, that's a great idea.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.580
It really is.

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.160
Tonight, then.

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:09.580
Who was that?

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:12.250
A colleague. You don't know her.

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:32.040
Hello?

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:33.910
Yes.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.040
Good evening.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.870
Well, I'm going to bed now.

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:41.000
Alright then.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.200
I've already taken my sleeping pill.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:45.830
I usually fall asleep pretty quickly.

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:52.040
Look, one more thing...

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.580
Er...

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:58.790
You don't have to be afraid of me. I...

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:01.450
Sorry, forget it...

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:04.540
I know I'm a little ridiculous.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.200
Sleep well.

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:52.910
It was lovely.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:23.370
We could go out for lunch tomorrow.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:27.750
Let me invite you to my old favorite place.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.290
Hello.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:53.830
Well, did you find anything?

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:58.410
Just one person, but,
you know... it's not actual proof of crime.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.500
Who is it?

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.120
Jenő Vári...

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.620
The HR manager.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:05.540
Are you surprised?

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.500
Are you 100% sure?

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:13.450
In my profession, you can't ever
really say... you're 100% sure.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:17.000
But... it's a very strong probability.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.410
Here is my report.
Shall I forward them to the police?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.950
No need. We'll do it.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.040
Did you give us your invoice?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.120
Yes, yes, sure.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.410
Thank you for coming in personally.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.870
Good-bye.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.370
Just out of professional curiosity...

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:45.120
Your colleague's dream...

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:49.080
Did a similar coincidence
ever happen again?

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.750
I suppose you compared dreams since then...

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.000
No. We didn't compare.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.410
Good-bye.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.450
So it really was a joke?

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.700
You arranged it beforehand?

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Yes, that's exactly what happened.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.410
I'm sorry, it was a childish idea.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.830
I apologize.

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:16.370
Good-bye.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.160
Well...

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.250
what did the great shrink come up with?

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.450
Nothing much.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.790
How come?

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.700
She thinks it was Sándor too.

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:51.160
Seriously?

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.040
So what now?

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:58.000
Do we fire him?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.500
What do you think?

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:05.620
Will you tell the cops?

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:06.950
I suppose.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.040
I'll call them tomorrow.

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:12.330
Right, of course.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.330
These tests... They don't mean much.

01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:22.950
It was stupid to do it in the first place.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.790
Whose idea was it anyway?

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:26.790
I think it was mine.

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:28.750
Oh... sorry.

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:42.290
It wasn't Sándor.

01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:43.540
No?

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.830
I know it wasn't him.

01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:50.700
Really?

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.540
It was me.

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:01.160
I don't know what got into me.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.700
I just got fed up.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.540
Yeah, it happens.

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.120
Sometimes you just get fed up.

01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:18.540
So...

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.870
What now?

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.410
Nothing. Don't do it again.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.040
But...

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.830
No one got hurt.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.870
They just had a weird night, that's all.

01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:39.290
The police will close
the case after a while.

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:42.910
They're not too concerned about it anyway.

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:48.750
It was nasty of me to blame it on Sándor.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.500
Yes.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:53.910
But you know...

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.120
It was.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.250
Sándor!

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.620
I want to apologize to you.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.500
So... I apologize.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.540
And we can be on a first-name basis.

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:34.620
Thank you.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.410
I mean, thanks.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.620
We could have a beer together...

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.750
No, I'm in no hurry. I'm free all evening.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:06.620
You want to hook yourself a man, doctor?

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.500
Yes.

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:13.200
That's not how you do it.

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:15.250
How do I do it?

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.370
You're nice and tall.

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:25.000
You should wear clothes that show it.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:28.330
Don't dress like a waif.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.540
Turn around.

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:35.200
Nice ass too...

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.500
I've never noticed it before.

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:40.790
Stand up straight.

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:42.410
There!

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:45.370
That's worth more than any fancy clothes.

01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:49.750
But the way you hold your head...

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.160
Chin up.

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:54.160
Not that much...

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.580
Then you'll seem cocky.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.160
That's what they say about you anyway...

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.290
Movement...

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:10.250
People underestimate...
the power of movement, honey.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.620
The effect of how you move.

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:23.250
Look...

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.620
You don't need much.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:32.200
Too much ruins everything.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.750
Now...

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.000
Walk along here. Show me.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.750
Chips.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.330
Tissues.

01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:50.250
Two?

01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:51.370
Sure.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.450
Listen, do you have any proper aftershave?

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.500
I do.

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:04.370
Thanks...

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.370
Strange...

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.910
This place was always full.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.790
Hello?

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.000
Hi.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.160
The food here is great.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.080
Lunch?

01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:14.450
Yes, if it's not an inconvenience for you.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.580
What do you mean?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Forget it.

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.910
Never mind...

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.700
Tell me...

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.700
Does János still work here?

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.200
So you wanna have lunch or just chat?

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.120
I have an idea.

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.410
I'd really love to sleep with you.

01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:40.950
Oh...

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.540
Nothing else.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.500
Just sleep in the same room.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.830
Fall asleep together.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.200
And when we wake up...
we can talk about what we dreamt.

01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:56.950
What do you say?

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.500
I can't sleep right now.

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:30.200
Me neither.

01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:35.830
What should we do?

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.910
I'd better go home.

01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:41.250
Stay.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.580
Let's talk.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.200
Okay.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.790
About what?

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.000
Well...

01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:53.830
Or, let's play cards!

01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:56.000
I don't know how to play.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.000
I'll teach you.

01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:04.040
And ten.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.950
I call.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.870
Sixteen.

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:17.450
Incredible!

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:21.540
How are you so good at this?

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:24.500
Honestly now.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.580
Did you know I was bluffing?

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.040
I thought you were.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.660
But how?

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:33.290
You couldn't read my face, for sure.

01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:35.160
I was so careful.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.450
I didn't move my face at all.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.330
Exactly! You didn't twitch at all.

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:41.620
Oh.

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:46.410
But how did you know what I had?

01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:49.330
I remembered the cards.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:52.200
My memory is abnormally developed.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.250
It has its downsides too.

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:57.290
You simply remember everything?

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:03.580
Your first sentence to
me was: "Bon appétit."

01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:07.250
That's not so hard to remember.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:09.040
Then we introduced ourselves...

01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:10.830
I remember it too.

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:13.200
Your fifth sentence was:

01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:16.830
You chose the garden sorrel too.

01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:20.160
Not much else though...
except the shredded squash, maybe.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.370
God, that's incredible.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.330
What about, say...

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.120
the 17th sentence?

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.000
I won't beat around the bush.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.790
Look, the girls said...
you're labeling everything Grade B.

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:38.450
The cattle seemed quite nice.
Don't you think?

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:41.370
Good God...

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.450
that's uncanny.

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.410
But are you sure that was the 17th?

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.040
Shall I start from the beginning?

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:49.830
I believe you.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.080
Did I misunderstand something?

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.790
You know...

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:14.620
I closed this chapter of my life
a few years ago.

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:18.750
There were women...

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.370
thinking back now,
fewer would have been better.

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.080
Then when...

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.290
There was a point when I said...

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580
that's it.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.450
I'm out of the game.

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.450
And I was fine with that, till now.

01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:42.000
And now...

01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:49.080
Do you think it's so easy...
making a fool of myself now?

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:09.000
Will you get the kids from school?
I have to go to the hairdresser's.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.410
Sure.

01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:13.330
Then you can buy groceries...

01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:12.870
Are you sure... you don't want to talk
to an adult therapist?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.040
I am.

01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:18.910
Look...

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:21.410
I don't know what to say.

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.450
This is just like anything else.

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.080
Observation. Practice.

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.120
I'm doing it.

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.250
I watch 3 different series...

01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:32.910
and porno movies...

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.790
I don't recommend that.

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:37.160
It's physical contact...

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.160
that causes you problems, right?

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:41.450
Yes.

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.330
Well, then practice that.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.200
Do you have a pet?

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:47.500
No.

01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:49.250
That's alright...

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.620
I don't really know what to say.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:56.410
Try this, for instance...

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:58.370
close your eyes...

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:01.120
put your hand on your face...

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.620
and caress it gently.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.830
Like this.

01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:11.120
Try to touch all sorts of...

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.160
Is it possible... that two people
dream the same thing?

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:17.200
I mean, that they meet in their dreams?

01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:20.950
What made you think of this now?

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.870
Can it happen?

01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:28.700
Look, you're a smart woman...

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.870
You're a university graduate.
I don't understand this at all.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.750
Another thing that might help...

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.160
is music.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
It can also have a mood-altering effect.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:59.910
I'd like to listen to these.

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:03.040
Won't that be a bit too many?

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:04.950
No.

01:26:06.330 --> 01:26:09.040
Do it. You've got time.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.120
Sorry, we're closing.

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:02.580
We're closing!

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:07.330
You want one of them?

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.660
I don't know.

01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:11.370
What are you looking for?

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:13.250
Love music.

01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:14.500
What???

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:16.660
Music for people in love.

01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.000
And you didn't like any of these?

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:26.870
Listen...

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.040
I show you my favorite if you want.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:38.950
Will you listen to it?

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.370
No, I'll buy it.

01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:05.910
"Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay."

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.410
"He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say."

01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:17.870
"Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away."

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:23.450
"He laughed at my sins,
in his arms I must stay."

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.540
"He wrote,"

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:33.830
"I am broke, please send for me."

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:41.500
"But I am broken too, and spoken for,"

01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:56.580
Damn it...

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.700
For fuck's sake already!

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.620
The boss...

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:24.410
That wasn't so bad, right?

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:29.040
I don't know why we ever stopped.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.500
Don't miss your last bus.

01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:41.700
I'm staying over now.

01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:43.700
We'll have a good sleep.

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:46.700
Don't be silly.

01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:49.120
What's your problem?

01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:52.120
You can't sleep here.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.370
Why not? I don't get you.

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.790
I can only sleep alone.

01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:02.830
Since when?

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.160
Really. I'm serious.

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:11.830
You can fuck me, but you
can't sleep beside me?

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.620
Don't be stupid.

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:17.200
Are you crazy?

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:22.080
Well, you're certainly not kicking me out
in the middle of the night.

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.750
It's only after 11.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
Stop it already. Don't make me mad.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.080
Good night.

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.040
I have no idea what to eat.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.410
The ratatouille was pretty good yesterday.

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.500
I'll have salad for sure.

01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:34.830
Hello.

01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:35.910
Hello.

01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:40.000
I could sleep over tonight.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.080
I brought my pajamas with me.

01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:43.700
Look...

01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:45.500
I've been meaning to tell you...

01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:48.540
I don't want to hurt you...

01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:51.290
But there's not much point in doing this.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.580
Right?

01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.160
A risotto please.

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.410
I thought it over last night.

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:05.330
We're just not cut out for this.
It just wasn't working out.

01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:15.830
What would you like?

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.080
Cream of celery or potato soup?

01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:20.580
Celery.

01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:25.580
At least we tried. It's no tragedy.

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.620
We can still be good friends.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.330
Of course.

01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:35.120
Actually, it'll be easier this way.

01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.000
No more tension, right?

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:39.790
Right.

01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:41.830
Bye, then...

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:40.700
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay.

01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:46.410
"He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say."

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:52.250
"Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away."

01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:58.700
"He laughed at my sins,
in his arms I must stay."

01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:02.290
"He wrote,"

01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:09.410
"I am broke, please send for me."

01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:19.910
"But I am broken too,
and spoken for, do not tempt me."

01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.080
"Her skin is white, and I'm..."

01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:22.540
Hello?

01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:25.160
Good evening.

01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:26.200
Good evening.

01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:30.330
I don't really have any reason for calling.

01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:31.250
Am I bothering you?

01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.290
No.

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.540
And are you having a pleasant evening?

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.200
I was listening to music.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:41.910
But something's wrong with the player.

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.410
I'm afraid it's broken.

01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:54.330
I didn't even know you liked music.

01:43:58.910 --> 01:44:00.870
Actually, I don't.

01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.910
Just this one song.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.410
But now I can't even
listen to that anymore.

01:44:12.330 --> 01:44:13.450
Too bad.

01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:15.950
Well, yes.

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.410
Alright then...

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.830
Bye. Have a nice evening.

01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:27.870
You have a nice evening too.

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.000
Sorry...

01:44:31.450 --> 01:44:32.500
Hello? Are you still there?

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:33.910
Yes, I'm here.

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.250
I...

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.620
I feel like I'm going to die...

01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.540
I love you so much.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.910
I love you so much too.

01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:48.750
I'd like to...

01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:50.870
look into...

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:54.290
Can we meet?

01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:55.910
Yes.

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.500
I'll hurry.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.120
There's still something I need to do.

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:05.200
It'll take a little while...
but I'll really hurry.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.200
We need to keep you in for a few days.

01:45:43.410 --> 01:45:45.620
The psychologist will
come to see you tomorrow.

01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:48.250
The nurse will show your bed.

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:13.080
I'm sleepy.

01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.620
Let's sleep then.

01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:01.410
Will you slice the tomato for me?

01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:17.040
Sorry.

01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:23.080
Here.

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:32.250
Would you like some cold cuts?

01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:33.540
No, thank you.

01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:06.080
By the way, what did we dream last night?

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.200
Somehow I can't remember.

01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:19.160
I think I didn't dream anything.

01:51:56.330 --> 01:52:01.660
"Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay."

01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:07.410
"He cut out my tongue,
there is nothing to say."

01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:13.750
"Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away."

01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:19.580
"He laughed at my sins,
in his arms I must stay."

01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:23.120
"He wrote,"

01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:30.250
"I am broke, please send for me."

01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:40.830
"But I am broken too,
and spoken for, do not tempt me."

01:52:42.450 --> 01:52:47.410
"Her skin is white, and
I'm light as the sun,"

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:52.790
"so holy light shines on
the things you have done."

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.620
"So I asked him how he became this man,"

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:03.790
"how did he learn to hold
fruit in his hands,"

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.950
"and where is the lamb
that gave you your name,"

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.000
"he had to leave though
I begged him to stay"

01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:19.450
"Left me alone when I needed the light,"

01:53:20.290 --> 01:53:25.040
"fell to my knees and I wept for my life."

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:30.160
"if he had of stayed you might understand,"

01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:35.500
"if he had of stayed you never
would have taken my hand."

01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:45.660
"He wrote, oh love, please send for me,"

01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:56.250
"but I am broken too,
and spoken for, do not tempt me."

01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:02.410
"And where is the lamb
that gave you your name,"

01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:07.750
"He had to leave though
I begged him to stay."

01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:13.040
"Begged him to stay in
my cold wooden grip,"

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:17.580
"begged him to stay by
the light of this ship."

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:22.830
"Me fighting him, fighting
like fighting dawn,"

01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:27.580
"and the waves came and stole him
and took him to war."

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:37.950
"He wrote, I'm broke, 
please send for me."

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:48.160
"But I'm broken too,
and spoken for, do not tempt me."

01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:54.870
"Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay,"

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.790
"cut out my tongue, there
is nothing to say."

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.830
"Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away,"

01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:11.160
"he laughed at my sins,
in his arms I must say."

01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:21.580
"We write, that's alright,
I miss his smell."

01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:31.540
"We speak when spoken to,
and that suits us well"

01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:32.830
"During the shooting of our film
animals were harmed,"

01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:34.290
"but none of them for
the sake of this film."

01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:35.830
"We just documented the daily 
routine of a slaughterhouse."

01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:43.830
"That suits us well. 
That suits me well."
