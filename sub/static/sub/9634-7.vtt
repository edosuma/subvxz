01:55.334 --> 01:58.167
[NARRATOR] In search of their
sixth Dragon Ball, our three

01:58.250 --> 02:01.250
adventurers, Bulma, Goku
and Oolong, now make their

02:01.334 --> 02:04.584
way toward Fire Mountain,
the legendary home of a

02:04.667 --> 02:08.709
terrible giant: the Ox-King.

02:08.792 --> 02:11.584
How much longer
until we get there?

02:11.667 --> 02:13.459
Not long enough!

02:13.542 --> 02:16.042
[BULMA] Are you still scared
of that silly, old legend?

02:16.125 --> 02:19.167
[BULMA] It's not real, you know.
I mean, listen to yourself!

02:19.250 --> 02:21.459
[BULMA] Seriously, how
could a whole mountain

02:21.542 --> 02:23.042
really be on fire?

02:23.125 --> 02:25.542
[OOLONG] Great! I'm stuck
with a couple of non-believers.

02:25.625 --> 02:29.125
Well, you just wait until
you see it for yourselves!

02:31.125 --> 02:34.792
[BULMA] I gotta admit it is
getting hotter all of a sudden!

02:34.875 --> 02:37.709
[panting]

02:37.792 --> 02:41.875
Look at the sunset!
Is it ever bright!

02:42.959 --> 02:46.167
Oh, wow! Eww.
I gotta brush my teeth...

02:46.667 --> 02:50.125
[OOLONG] That isn't the sun, you
idiots, that's Fire Mountain!

02:50.209 --> 02:52.875
No way!
I can't believe it!

02:59.292 --> 03:00.667
Better ease back,
my friend.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.292
We don't want to
be spotted just yet.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.292
[PUAR] Right!

03:15.167 --> 03:17.542
[SHU] In a way, I'm
glad we're almost there,

03:17.625 --> 03:19.042
but in a way, I'm not.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.292
[MAI] How're we
going to tell Pilaf

03:20.375 --> 03:22.000
we didn't get the Dragon Balls?

03:22.084 --> 03:24.334
[SHU] I don't know. I'm scared.

03:24.417 --> 03:26.917
Yeah, just once
I'd like to hear that

03:27.000 --> 03:30.167
little mutant encourage us
with words of appreciation.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.917
You mean like
"Shu, Mai, just relax!

03:33.000 --> 03:37.959
Some failures are to be
expected in the spy business!"

03:38.042 --> 03:41.042
You are too kind,
oh wise Emperor!

03:41.125 --> 03:44.417
Let's face it, Shu,
our goose is cooked!

03:44.500 --> 03:47.000
Guess I'd better update my will.

03:48.459 --> 03:50.125
[MAI] I just hope he
hasn't installed his new

03:50.209 --> 03:52.250
"Do-It-Yourself
Torture Chamber" yet.

03:56.209 --> 03:59.334
So, in other words,
you have failed me once again!

03:59.417 --> 04:02.042
You could put
it that way, sire.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.500
Yes, I guess
you could say that.

04:04.584 --> 04:06.500
Well, this is
the spy business.

04:06.584 --> 04:09.250
Some failures
are to be expected.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.375
So relax! Eat! Good work!

04:16.125 --> 04:18.166
You fools! You know I
don't greet failure with a

04:18.250 --> 04:19.541
pat on the back!

04:19.625 --> 04:21.041
[squealing]

04:21.125 --> 04:22.500
[PILAF] You must pay for this!

04:26.167 --> 04:27.834
[giggling]

04:27.917 --> 04:32.084
[crying]

04:32.167 --> 04:33.500
[SHU] We're toast!

04:35.084 --> 04:37.167
[PILAF] Why, you imbeciles!
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

04:37.709 --> 04:40.000
[giggling]

04:48.792 --> 04:51.542
[thunder]

04:51.625 --> 05:00.000
[screaming]

05:00.084 --> 05:03.250
That was a shocking experience,
don't you think?

05:03.334 --> 05:05.459
Yeah, a real charge.

05:05.542 --> 05:08.250
Let's hope you two
morons have learned your lesson!

05:19.959 --> 05:22.500
Well, there's Fire Mountain!

05:25.667 --> 05:29.000
[BULMA] Wow! I've
never seen anything like it!

05:31.834 --> 05:33.542
[GOKU] Oohh...

05:33.625 --> 05:34.500
[BULMA] Uh-huh...

05:36.084 --> 05:37.667
[OOLONG] I don't know about
you guys, but I've seen enough.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.417
[OOLONG] I'm ready to go!

05:39.875 --> 05:42.625
We have to get the
Dragon Ball first, Oolong.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.459
No silly bonfire's
gonna scare me away!

05:45.542 --> 05:47.709
A towering mountain
engulfed in eternal flames

05:47.792 --> 05:49.375
doesn't scare you,
huh? Well it scares

05:49.459 --> 05:53.375
the sausage out of me! Besides,
the evil Ox-King lives there

05:53.459 --> 05:55.084
and he'll have our heads!

05:55.167 --> 05:57.417
[BULMA] I bet he's got the ball!

05:57.500 --> 06:00.917
[OOLONG] Yeah, I'm sure it's up
there, probably in his castle.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.125
[OOLONG] And it's all yours.
Just get past the fiercest

06:04.209 --> 06:06.334
giant in the world and
pass through that wall

06:06.417 --> 06:07.875
of flames there, and
then you can have it!

06:08.584 --> 06:10.250
[BULMA] Does he live
up there in the castle?

06:10.334 --> 06:13.084
[OOLONG] He did, but
they say even he can't pass

06:13.167 --> 06:14.667
through those flames.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.167
So then,
why did he start the fire?

06:17.250 --> 06:19.834
No, no!
He didn't start it, kid.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.584
He paid some magical wizard to
create a fire to protect his

06:22.667 --> 06:25.875
castle from thieves, right?
And then it raged out of

06:25.959 --> 06:29.167
control, and he's been stuck
on the outside ever since!

06:29.250 --> 06:31.042
You sure know a lot about it!

06:31.125 --> 06:32.709
[OOLONG] I was a
tour guide for the local

06:32.792 --> 06:35.209
Chamber of Commerce,
okay? And I just remembered,

06:35.292 --> 06:38.625
I forgot to clock out,
so, see you later, ha ha!

06:39.625 --> 06:41.625
You're the biggest
coward I know!

06:41.709 --> 06:43.417
[OOLONG] Well, I know
why you're not scared,

06:43.500 --> 06:45.542
you think Goku's
gonna protect you!

06:45.625 --> 06:48.417
But he's no match
for the Ox-King!

06:48.500 --> 06:50.542
My Grandpa taught me
how to be fearless,

06:50.625 --> 06:51.750
so I'm not scared.

06:51.834 --> 06:52.917
[OOLONG] Yeah? Well
I'll show you what my

06:53.000 --> 06:54.792
grandpa taught me, squirt!

06:54.875 --> 06:56.292
Hey!

06:56.375 --> 06:58.750
Let's let him
get a head start!

06:58.834 --> 07:00.667
[BULMA] You get
back here, you...

07:01.459 --> 07:04.250
[growling]

07:04.334 --> 07:05.500
[BULMA] Piggy!

07:06.375 --> 07:08.167
[BULMAR] Piggy!

07:08.250 --> 07:10.459
[intense diarrhea]

07:10.542 --> 07:11.834
[BULMA and GOKU] Piggy! Piggy!

07:11.917 --> 07:13.500
--[BULMA] Piggy!
--[GOKU laughing]

07:13.584 --> 07:15.084
[GOKU] Piggy!

07:18.167 --> 07:20.584
Look, Yamcha!
They're on the move again.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.834
You're right, Puar,
and they're heading straight for

07:22.917 --> 07:26.875
Fire Mountain. I bet that
means the sixth Dragon Ball

07:26.959 --> 07:29.959
is up there in the
Ox-King's castle.

07:30.042 --> 07:33.167
What?! Oh, well that
Dragon Ball's definitely lost!

07:33.250 --> 07:35.375
So you don't think
they have a chance?

07:35.459 --> 07:38.709
[PUAR] Actually, they have
two chances: slim and none!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.167
That Dragon Ball's
as good as gone.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.334
Well, I suppose
you're probably right,

07:43.417 --> 07:45.584
but let's stick
around for the show.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.250
And just what
show is that, Master?

07:48.334 --> 07:51.125
[YAMCHA] Come on, that kid Goku
is so confident I imagine he'll

07:51.209 --> 07:53.917
try and take on the
Ox-King. Don't you agree?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.584
Mm-hmm. I suppose so.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.334
And there you have
it, my furry, little friend!

07:59.417 --> 08:01.875
We finally get a chance
to watch poor, little Goku

08:01.959 --> 08:04.125
get torn limb from limb!

08:04.917 --> 08:05.709
[screaming]

08:05.792 --> 08:06.542
Huh?

08:06.625 --> 08:08.417
What?!

08:08.500 --> 08:18.375
[screaming]

08:18.459 --> 08:21.792
Oh no! Somebody help!

08:22.459 --> 08:24.042
[fleash slicing]

08:28.959 --> 08:30.167
[screaming]

08:30.250 --> 08:31.584
Gross, look what I've done!

08:31.667 --> 08:33.167
I chopped his head right off!

08:37.500 --> 08:39.333
Now I've seen everything!

08:39.417 --> 08:42.292
I don't think she even
had her eyes open, do you?

08:42.375 --> 08:45.250
[crying]

08:45.334 --> 08:47.334
Hey, nice work.

08:47.417 --> 08:49.875
I was told to never
talk to strangers!

08:49.959 --> 08:52.417
Hey, watch out!

08:53.209 --> 08:54.209
[GIRL screams]

08:56.667 --> 08:58.209
That girl's dangerous!

08:58.292 --> 09:01.375
All right, Puar, we've wasted
enough time here already.

09:01.459 --> 09:03.750
We'd better get
back on the road.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.250
That girl was real cute,
Yamcha.

09:09.334 --> 09:11.959
So why didn't you get
scared of her and run away?

09:12.042 --> 09:14.834
It's only girls my
age that scare me.

09:16.917 --> 09:23.459
[flames roaring]

09:23.542 --> 09:25.875
I just can't stand this heat!

09:25.959 --> 09:27.709
Whoa, be quiet!

09:27.792 --> 09:30.750
If the Ox-King hears us
we're dead meat, you know?!

09:34.209 --> 09:37.000
Boy, that sure
is a massive fire!

09:40.500 --> 09:43.875
Well, the Dragon Ball's
definitely up in the castle,

09:43.959 --> 09:46.250
but how do we
get it out of there?

09:46.334 --> 09:48.375
What do you say, Goku?

09:48.459 --> 09:51.709
Do you think you can fly up
there and get the Dragon Ball?

09:52.084 --> 09:54.459
[GOKU] I tried that once,
and look what happened!

09:55.042 --> 09:56.875
Goku, you're crazy!

09:56.959 --> 09:58.250
[giggling]

09:58.334 --> 09:59.209
I know.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.834
Flying Nimbus!

10:03.084 --> 10:06.000
Now you've done it!
The Ox-King heard that for sure!

10:12.542 --> 10:14.750
Get that Dragon Ball, Goku!

10:14.834 --> 10:16.750
Hurry back here, okay?!

10:16.834 --> 10:21.917
[flames roaring]

10:22.000 --> 10:24.125
[GOKU] Wow, it's hotter
than I thought up here.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.334
Oh well, here it goes.

10:29.459 --> 10:32.959
[GOKU screaming]

10:33.042 --> 10:34.709
[whimpering]

10:36.000 --> 10:37.667
[splash]

10:38.042 --> 10:40.292
Great!
The kid's just giving up!

10:40.375 --> 10:41.709
And we should
do the same

10:41.792 --> 10:43.209
before we get ourselves killed!

10:50.042 --> 10:51.584
You alright there, tail?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.834
[BULMA squealing]

10:57.917 --> 11:03.167
[screaming]

11:14.375 --> 11:16.167
What're you two doing here?

11:17.042 --> 11:21.334
Who... us? We-We
weren't doing anything?

11:24.209 --> 11:26.459
Don't tell me you've come
to steal the treasures from

11:26.542 --> 11:30.042
my castle, huh? Have you?!

11:31.042 --> 11:32.459
[BULMA] Uh-uh!

11:32.542 --> 11:34.125
I swear we didn't even know
there was a castle up there!

11:34.209 --> 11:36.084
Right Oolong? Oolong!

11:36.167 --> 11:37.917
[OOLONG] Uh-Huh!

11:39.334 --> 11:41.792
Are you lying?!

11:42.209 --> 11:44.417
[screaming]

11:57.500 --> 11:59.417
[BULMA] Goku!

11:59.500 --> 12:00.917
Power Pole, extend!

12:08.834 --> 12:10.334
It looks like it's going
to be tougher than we

12:10.417 --> 12:12.167
thought getting
into that castle.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.250
[OX-KING] Ah-ha!

12:13.334 --> 12:14.334
You dummy!

12:15.167 --> 12:16.209
I knew it!

12:16.292 --> 12:18.834
You're just stinking
treasure hunters!

12:18.917 --> 12:20.167
[GOKU] That's not true, sir.

12:20.250 --> 12:28.584
What do you know about truth,
you little thief?!

12:28.667 --> 12:30.750
[BULMA] Atta boy, Goku,
keep him off balance!

12:31.125 --> 12:32.209
[BULMA] Whoo!

12:36.375 --> 12:37.375
[chuckling]

12:37.459 --> 12:38.917
It's time to get serious!

12:39.000 --> 12:40.042
Flying Nimbus!

12:42.500 --> 12:45.625
[OX-KING] Whoa! Hey! Stop that!

12:45.709 --> 12:46.584
[OX-KING] Cut it out!

12:53.667 --> 12:55.000
Urgh, this guy's a rock!

12:57.417 --> 12:59.334
Are you crazy, kid?!
Get outta there!

12:59.417 --> 13:00.834
You can't beat the Ox-King!

13:01.292 --> 13:03.500
You're the Ox-King??

13:03.584 --> 13:05.167
[OX-KING] Mm-hmm.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.750
So you're the great
Ox-King everyone's

13:06.834 --> 13:10.334
been talking about.
No wonder you're so strong!

13:10.417 --> 13:12.000
I know about that cloud,

13:12.084 --> 13:13.959
and you couldn't
ride it if you stole it!

13:14.042 --> 13:15.834
So who gave it to you?

13:15.917 --> 13:18.834
I got it from a man who
said he was a Turtle Hermit.

13:18.917 --> 13:22.084
Turtle Hermit?
His name's Master Roshi.

13:22.167 --> 13:25.750
He was my old teacher! Do
you know where I can find him?

13:27.417 --> 13:29.167
Hey, Bulma!
Do you think we could find the

13:29.250 --> 13:31.125
place where that
Turtle Hermit lives?

13:31.209 --> 13:33.000
The Ox-King wants to know.

13:33.084 --> 13:34.250
Probably.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.084
It's gotta be close to
that beach we were on.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.542
Ooh, eee!

13:37.625 --> 13:38.875
I can finally go
back to my castle!

13:38.959 --> 13:40.292
Oh boy, oh boy!

13:45.875 --> 13:48.500
Where did you get this
little toothpick that you

13:48.584 --> 13:49.417
carry on your back, here?

13:50.709 --> 13:51.959
Oh, that's no toothpick.
That's my Power Pole!

13:52.042 --> 13:55.584
Cool huh? My Grandpa gave
it to me before he died.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.542
[OX-KING] Hmm.
That's interesting.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.084
Was his name Gohan?

13:59.167 --> 14:00.084
[GOKU] Mm-hmm.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.250
[OX-KING] Ah-ha!

14:01.334 --> 14:03.750
Your grandpa Gohan
once tried to break that

14:03.834 --> 14:05.459
toothpick on my head!

14:05.542 --> 14:06.667
You mean you and my Grandpa

14:06.750 --> 14:08.542
used to fight each other?

14:09.334 --> 14:11.584
It seems our little
friend knows the Ox-King!

14:11.667 --> 14:13.334
I can't believe it, Puar!

14:13.417 --> 14:15.167
This kid is
starting to bug me.

14:17.584 --> 14:19.750
Why were you and
Grandpa fighting?

14:19.834 --> 14:21.584
[OX-KING] Because
we were like brothers!

14:21.667 --> 14:24.417
Your grandpa was the first
pupil chosen by Master Roshi,

14:24.500 --> 14:27.000
and I had the honor
of being the second!

14:27.459 --> 14:29.417
Ahh, so you're Gohan's boy.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.042
Yeah! My name is Goku!

14:32.125 --> 14:33.417
That's a fine name!

14:33.500 --> 14:35.042
"Goku!"

14:35.917 --> 14:39.250
That explains why
Goku is so strong!

14:39.334 --> 14:40.875
I should have
been nicer to him.

14:40.959 --> 14:44.000
I hope he still wants to go
find the Dragon Balls with me.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.417
All right, that's enough
talk about the good old days.

14:46.500 --> 14:50.042
There's something important
I want to ask of you, Goku.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.125
[GOKU] Yeah?

14:51.209 --> 14:53.209
Old Master Roshi
has in his possession a

14:53.292 --> 14:55.750
very powerful fan
made out of a palm leaf,

14:55.834 --> 14:58.000
called the Bansho Fan.

14:58.084 --> 14:59.542
[OX-KING] It's the only
thing that will extinguish

14:59.625 --> 15:03.167
Fire Mountain. Will you use
the Flying Nimbus to go to him

15:03.250 --> 15:05.250
and borrow the fan for me?

15:05.334 --> 15:06.500
Yeah, sure.

15:06.584 --> 15:08.875
And could you do
something for me?

15:08.959 --> 15:11.917
Hm! Yes!
Anything you ask.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.875
We're collecting these,
and I think you have one.

15:14.959 --> 15:15.959
Hey!

15:16.042 --> 15:17.750
I think I've seen
one in my castle!

15:17.834 --> 15:20.667
Yes, of course you can
have it my new, little friend.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.167
Aw, thanks!

15:22.917 --> 15:24.667
[BULMA] Atta boy, Goku!

15:24.750 --> 15:26.959
The kid saved my bacon!

15:27.042 --> 15:28.334
I see!

15:28.417 --> 15:30.667
So that's what those
Dragon Balls really look like!

15:30.750 --> 15:32.792
[PUAR] I was expecting
them to be bigger.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.792
I'll be back just
as soon as I can!

15:34.875 --> 15:37.417
Wait! There's
something you should know!

15:37.500 --> 15:41.167
Why, just yesterday I sent
my only daughter ChiChi

15:41.250 --> 15:43.167
to retrieve the
Bansho Fan for me.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.584
But now I'm worried,
'cause I feel something awful

15:45.667 --> 15:49.750
has happened to her. Please,
Goku. Find my ChiChi, and

15:49.834 --> 15:51.959
bring her back safely to me.

15:52.042 --> 15:53.334
ChiChi?

15:53.417 --> 15:56.750
Yes. She's a bit
of a coward but--Ahh...

15:56.834 --> 15:59.167
Say Goku, how would
you like to marry her?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.959
Uh... marry?

16:02.709 --> 16:04.042
[snickering]

16:04.375 --> 16:06.834
Here's a picture of ChiChi.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.125
I'll do my best to find her.

16:12.209 --> 16:15.750
Wow! All things considered,
she's quite a looker!

16:18.334 --> 16:19.542
This isn't good!

16:19.625 --> 16:22.209
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Yamcha?!

16:22.292 --> 16:25.417
Yeah, I'm dead meat
if that girl's not okay!

16:25.875 --> 16:28.792
Don't you worry Mister Ox-King,
I'll bring her back!

16:29.917 --> 16:31.500
Good luck, son!

16:31.584 --> 16:33.250
And be careful, Goku!

16:40.417 --> 16:42.417
[YAMCHA] Puar, the next time
I try to smack the daughter of

16:42.500 --> 16:45.500
some huge giant,
please, stop me!

16:45.584 --> 16:47.584
Hey, there she is!

16:47.667 --> 16:50.084
[PUAR] Uh-oh! She
hasn't moved a muscle!

16:50.167 --> 16:51.375
[YAMCHA] Come on, Puar!

16:52.209 --> 16:56.334
Hey kid! Wake up!
You can't be dead, please!

16:56.417 --> 16:58.875
[YAMCHA] Ahh, she's
breathing Puar! She's alive!

17:04.250 --> 17:06.041
Don't shoot, ChiChi!
I'm a friend!

17:06.125 --> 17:09.166
Huh? How do you
know my name is ChiChi?

17:09.250 --> 17:12.750
Uh, well let's just say
I'm a secret admirer of yours.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.416
I didn't want to
hurt you earlier,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.834
but you left me no choice.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.416
Oh!

17:18.500 --> 17:21.000
[YAMCHA] If you really want
to know the truth, my darling,

17:21.084 --> 17:26.541
I'm in love with you. Ever since
I first set eyes on you. Truly.

17:27.834 --> 17:30.042
Wow!
You're in love with me?

17:30.125 --> 17:31.417
Oooh! With me?!

17:31.500 --> 17:35.542
Of course!
I really am!

17:35.625 --> 17:37.125
[CHICHI] Are you
telling the truth?

17:37.209 --> 17:40.792
Just look into my face.
Can't you see it for yourself?

17:40.875 --> 17:42.500
See?

17:42.584 --> 17:44.542
Oh my, you look funny!

17:44.625 --> 17:46.834
Is that, uh, tooth
gonna grow back in?

17:48.375 --> 17:50.000
Remember the
Ox-King, Yamcha!

17:50.084 --> 17:52.084
We don't want to
blow this little charade!

17:52.417 --> 17:57.209
You know, you're the first boy
to say that he loves me, hehe!

17:57.292 --> 17:59.459
Why does that not surprise me?

17:59.542 --> 18:02.875
Oh, boy! I wonder if
papa will approve of him?

18:02.959 --> 18:06.375
I wonder if I'm even old
enough to have a boyfriend?!

18:06.459 --> 18:07.417
[YAMCHA] Let's get outta here!

18:07.500 --> 18:08.500
[PUAR] Right!

18:08.584 --> 18:10.959
Oh my!
This is all happening so fast!

18:11.042 --> 18:13.042
I just don't
know what to think!

18:13.125 --> 18:17.542
[crying]

18:18.834 --> 18:20.959
What the... Hey,
I wonder where he's going?

18:21.042 --> 18:23.875
I thought he loved me...

18:25.542 --> 18:27.667
[CHICHI] I know! He
must be the shy type.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.500
[CHICHI] How romantic...

18:31.459 --> 18:33.167
Hey, are you ChiChi??

18:33.250 --> 18:36.417
Yes I am, but I don't
think I know who you are.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.750
You're the second
boy today who

18:37.834 --> 18:39.584
knows my name is ChiChi.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.875
[screaming]

18:42.959 --> 18:44.209
[CHICHI] You must love me too!

18:44.292 --> 18:47.125
Well, you seem like a
pretty nice person to me.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.834
[CHICHI] But I'm not
even sure my papa will

18:48.917 --> 18:50.834
let me have a boyfriend yet!

18:50.917 --> 18:53.917
Well, don't worry about that,
you're dad sent me here!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.667
I'm supposed to help
you find Master Roshi

18:55.750 --> 18:57.834
so we can borrow the Bansho Fan!

18:57.917 --> 19:00.542
Really? That's so sweet of you.
