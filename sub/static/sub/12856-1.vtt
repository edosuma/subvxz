Edit By @ikanbilis

02:38.035 --> 02:42.609
Quick, honey. We have already closed.
- This is not acceptable.

02:41.663 --> 02:43.680
As I've discussed it yesterday.

02:43.681 --> 02:48.286
A massage at sunset with Tanya.
It should be Tanya.

02:48.686 --> 02:51.025
I need to know that the bank safe.

02:51.126 --> 02:54.443
Trust me. I have dozens of banks
updated. It'll be fine.

02:54.444 --> 02:57.818
I need guarantees.
- Gordon, you do.

02:57.819 --> 03:00.364
It's a security update.
Not the end of the world.

03:00.365 --> 03:04.435
I swear, if I leave again
Cooperstown should work and I miss ...

03:04.436 --> 03:08.454
I burn the whole thing flat.
- I see you. We all have plans.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.879
Mr. Sullivan, it is always a pleasure
to see you.

03:11.644 --> 03:14.246
I have this massage one month ago planned.

03:14.247 --> 03:17.791
No, I want Tanya.
Her hands and small pneumatic drills.

03:17.826 --> 03:20.513
Who can I get?
Jonathan?

03:20.514 --> 03:24.081
He has strong hands?

04:12.766 --> 04:16.055
Look at you.

04:19.231 --> 04:21.898
How may I help you?
- One hundred dollar exchange.

04:21.899 --> 04:25.817
How would you like it?
- Seven pennies, 31 quarters ...

04:25.818 --> 04:28.597
and 919 cents.
- What?

04:28.598 --> 04:33.949
That's too much money.
Than 107 pennies, 839 pennies ...

04:33.950 --> 04:39.290
29 quarters and half dollars 7 pieces.

04:42.566 --> 04:45.860
Is that Chile?

04:45.896 --> 04:48.810
Brazil.
- The U.S. dollar half I never use ...

04:48.811 --> 04:54.030
I can 101 pennies,
157 cents and 557 cents.

04:54.730 --> 04:58.270
That's a joke.
- No, I did something with coins.

04:58.271 --> 05:02.264
I love the weight, size
and how they ring in my pocket.

05:03.417 --> 05:06.485
That's pretty weird.
- What?

05:06.486 --> 05:09.798
The figures that you enumerated.
101, 157, 557 ...

05:09.799 --> 05:12.597
these are all primes.
- That no one ever noticed.

05:13.189 --> 05:15.695
I work with numbers all day.

05:15.696 --> 05:18.938
You do so in your head?
- Yes, good with math trick.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.824
I suppose so.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.775
Kaitlin.

05:22.776 --> 05:25.946
Actually ...

05:25.981 --> 05:29.166

05:44.484 --> 05:48.361
When did u get married?
- How do you know?

05:50.228 --> 05:53.053
My wedding presents.

05:53.054 --> 05:56.557
Are you going to marry Jay Z or something?
- My fiance's wealthy.

05:56.558 --> 06:01.067
Wealthy?
Over two days, they married in Brunei.

06:01.774 --> 06:04.265
My husband takes me disagree
along to the Sizzler.

06:04.301 --> 06:10.627
He is rich. But is he happy?
- We are very happy. Glad you asked.

06:12.048 --> 06:14.614
Darrien present.
- Weinstein present.

06:14.615 --> 06:18.569
Gates present.
- We go. Unlock the weapons.

06:21.179 --> 06:24.109
That's the door.
Use the remote control.

06:27.986 --> 06:31.173
Come on.

06:39.721 --> 06:44.256
One, two, three, four, five ...

06:44.257 --> 06:49.859
six and one seven.
Anything else I can do for you today?

06:49.860 --> 06:52.032
No, thanks.

06:52.033 --> 06:55.183
Thank you chose Credit International,
required a great day.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.561
You squeaks.
- I need my medications.

07:00.589 --> 07:03.529
Is there a pharmacy nearby.
- Two blocks from here.

07:03.530 --> 07:05.055
Nice to meet you, Kaitlin.

07:05.056 --> 07:08.645
Likewise, Tripp.
Good luck with everything.

07:22.146 --> 07:25.005
You are being robbed.

07:27.485 --> 07:30.031
What are you doing?

07:30.032 --> 07:32.977
This is a robbery.

07:32.978 --> 07:35.832
What are you doing here?
- What does it look?

07:35.833 --> 07:39.163
You rob the bank.
- This is obvious with the weapons and stuff?

07:39.165 --> 07:41.297
No, this is our work.
Go back.

07:41.298 --> 07:44.636
I see your name on the board outside.

07:45.229 --> 07:48.494
Unless his name is Credit.

07:48.495 --> 07:52.805
Given all the weird names that the parents
give their children these days.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.785
The alarm does not work.
- The phone does not.

07:55.786 --> 07:59.049
What do we do?
- Proceed as planned.

08:04.183 --> 08:06.152
Select the security update.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.547
If the system is rebooted,
The entire bank closed.

08:08.548 --> 08:11.316
We know. Turn on the quiet,
or I'll shoot you in the face.

08:11.317 --> 08:15.314
Wait a minute, boy.
Do it.

08:21.633 --> 08:24.587
You have exactly three seconds
to go back ...

08:24.588 --> 08:29.030
or will shoot at you.
- There are plenty of ATM machines.

08:29.031 --> 08:32.061
A ...
- Two blasts off on it.

08:32.097 --> 08:36.341
I heard that.
- Two, three.

09:06.331 --> 09:08.743
It's now or never.

09:31.127 --> 09:32.710
Hes not gonna make it.
- Go down.

09:39.189 --> 09:41.773
I know your heart
sitting in a firefight ...

09:41.774 --> 09:45.046
there is a wounded.
I look as if everything is okay.

09:45.047 --> 09:48.758
I come down.
Do not shoot.

09:48.759 --> 09:52.208
Do not shoot.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.221
I can shoot.
- We.

09:54.222 --> 09:57.888
Go back.
- Wait.

10:01.529 --> 10:04.509
Has anything ever happened to you?
- Certainly not.

10:04.544 --> 10:07.164
He's dead.
- That happens sometimes ...

10:07.165 --> 10:10.557
in the crossfire situations.
Do not look so hard for.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.888
You are here for the safe, right?
- Who is this guy?

10:14.889 --> 10:18.538
He talked about cracking ATMs?
- Maybe.

10:18.539 --> 10:21.100
What's the problem?

10:21.701 --> 10:25.054
Imagine now that we really
to rob the same bank?

10:25.090 --> 10:27.264
Yes, why not?

10:27.265 --> 10:29.944
Pretend it's two different banks.
- He has gone mad.

10:31.109 --> 10:32.985
You do not here about it?

10:33.086 --> 10:35.445
I do not want to add more murders
more add to my list perpetrator.

10:35.446 --> 10:38.766
He wears shorts in a bank robbery.
We need to murder him.

10:38.767 --> 10:42.702
How old do you think?
- We need to murder him.

10:42.703 --> 10:45.116
Why do we have guns?
I want to shoot him.

10:45.117 --> 10:48.361
The guns were meant for hostages.
That was the plan.

10:48.362 --> 10:51.756
Now we have two hostages.
- What is our plan?

10:51.757 --> 10:54.662
If they want to bank with us
rob, we do it.

10:54.663 --> 10:57.548
If they want to murder us,
We then murder them first.

10:57.549 --> 11:01.982
Cool plan.
- Listen. We take them to the vault.

11:01.983 --> 11:04.645
If the ATM you want, fine.

11:04.647 --> 11:07.622
Leave us alone.
- Roger that, big guy.

11:07.623 --> 11:10.645
That mean you do not?

11:10.038 --> 11:15.502
What does he want?
- That we come to him?

11:16.632 --> 11:20.955
It's good. Come here you.
- Keep an eye on him.

11:22.083 --> 11:24.881
You're crazy.

11:26.213 --> 11:30.721
Want to come?
Put the guns down.

11:30.722 --> 11:34.469
Come here.
Let us introduce ourselves.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.964
We can still be friends?

11:36.965 --> 11:40.047
I'm Peanut Butter
and this is Jelly.

11:40.051 --> 11:43.206
Those are our real names.

11:43.207 --> 11:48.012
We wanted something that sounded good together
Milk and Cookies, and was already in use.

11:48.013 --> 11:50.612
That mean you do not?

11:51.430 --> 11:54.659
I want the hostages have now gone.

12:04.385 --> 12:10.887
Cell phones, pagers
everything that you or off the power.

12:10.888 --> 12:14.750
Of course guns. Thank you
guards are worthless.

12:14.751 --> 12:17.798
Guys, I have here.

12:17.799 --> 12:20.446
Obviously you here.
You're a hostage.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.597
Get on it.

12:22.598 --> 12:25.821
Shut up and touch nothing.

12:28.954 --> 12:30.992
Go to that door.

12:30.993 --> 12:33.923
May I ...
- Stay away from that door.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.528
Please do not kill me on the toilet.

12:48.529 --> 12:51.422
What kind of assholes that here?

12:51.423 --> 12:53.973
Are not you ashamed?

13:01.777 --> 13:07.195
Those guys are great.
- Fantastic.

13:14.861 --> 13:19.167
We apologize on behalf of the bank.

13:19.168 --> 13:23.441
Equally correct.
It really sorry.

13:23.442 --> 13:26.658
Please, Rex.
- I'm Rex Neubauer.

13:26.659 --> 13:29.024
I work for loans
and we are lucky.

13:29.026 --> 13:31.472
I am a certified consultant robbery.

13:31.473 --> 13:34.597
I got to 75 survivors of bank robberies
advice given.

13:34.598 --> 13:39.893
We'll work it out.
Our first goal is ...

13:39.894 --> 13:43.311
for a peaceful co-unity.
Can I help you?

13:43.312 --> 13:45.245
Our goal is to come live here.

13:45.246 --> 13:48.809
As an expert in standard
bank robberies procedures ...

13:48.810 --> 13:52.919
This bank robbery is not standard.
Two robberies in progress.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.118
And one dead. A guarantee that the robbers
come and murder us.

13:56.119 --> 13:59.376
Do not say that.
- I do not want to die.

13:59.377 --> 14:01.910
Let's stay calm.

14:13.818 --> 14:18.058
This bank is open five hours.
Then I and my colleagues have long gone.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.931
We're all trapped.

14:19.932 --> 14:23.487
Even if you come out of this kitchen
then you are not from the bank.

14:24.337 --> 14:31.933
So sit down and shut up.
- If we often go to the toilet?

14:31.934 --> 14:34.752
There's toilet break.
You will not try to escape ...

14:34.753 --> 14:39.284
or contact with someone
outside the bank. And no noise.

14:36.735 --> 14:39.266
Alarm on your watch?
Are you in the sixth grade?

14:39.267 --> 14:41.916
It runs every hour.
In memory of my medications.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.050
Unfortunately I have not.
Or has anyone Deprocaine?

14:45.051 --> 14:48.005
I have Xanax.
- I have Ativan and Prilosec.

14:48.006 --> 14:50.583
I have a couple of Ritalin.
- I have maybe some Prozac.

14:50.584 --> 14:53.458
I Adderol and Nassonex.
- Are you kidding me?

14:53.492 --> 14:56.759
Shut up.
I just said, 'not talk'.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.137
What's going on?
- Is Oprah's book club here?

14:59.138 --> 15:03.279
Should I beat up someone? - No.
Have you turned off the cameras and computers?

15:03.280 --> 15:06.358
Do I really did not beat anyone up?
- I just said that.

15:06.359 --> 15:08.731
Go get the scrambler.

15:10.212 --> 15:12.853
That's ridiculous accent.

15:15.964 --> 15:20.923
Before we get to work,
let us first look at the other boys.

15:24.015 --> 15:30.444
I will start shortly with the lance,
ensure that the time slot is ready on time.

15:33.414 --> 15:37.541
No problems. We came
just look at your toys.

15:36.442 --> 15:39.423
You look so great.
- Did you see my face?

15:40.082 --> 15:43.268
Did you see my face?
- No.

15:43.269 --> 15:46.914
Admit it. Do not lie to me.
You've seen my face.

15:47.612 --> 15:52.024
I may have seen your face.
- I've seen it too.

15:52.058 --> 15:55.177
A very attractive face.
- Shut up.

15:56.031 --> 16:00.392
You are damn kids.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.697
You are worse than my kids.
You do not know ...

16:03.698 --> 16:06.650
what you are doing.
Have you ever rob a bank?

16:06.651 --> 16:09.969
A lot.
- We had the job with ...

16:09.970 --> 16:14.417
The Calahan brothers in Dubuque.
- What are you doing?

16:14.418 --> 16:18.829
That's what I mean.
Say nothing about those other jobs.

16:18.831 --> 16:21.187
And nothing about the people
you've done it.

16:21.188 --> 16:25.352
Rob no bank without a mask.

16:25.353 --> 16:28.784
Come on, guys.
That's asking for trouble.

16:28.785 --> 16:32.283
Like your tattoos.
- Like them?

16:32.284 --> 16:36.567
Look at this.
You can try to tie me ...

16:36.568 --> 16:38.984
but it does not.

16:47.770 --> 16:54.269
He did not understand. Do it again.
- I understand it really.

16:54.850 --> 16:58.021
I think I need to talk slower.

16:58.053 --> 17:06.428
Criminals usually try
their characteristics are not showing.

17:09.771 --> 17:13.213
Duce not identified
be.

17:28.747 --> 17:31.884
You may have spouses
and wives who will panic ...

17:31.885 --> 17:34.958
when you get home tonight.
You may leave a ring.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.861
You say that with
a friend to stay overnight ...

17:37.862 --> 17:41.242
and you will be persuasive.
Otherwise I'll shoot you mess.

17:41.243 --> 17:44.010
Who is first?
You?

17:44.011 --> 17:47.461
You? No?
You then, with that ugly tie.

18:01.751 --> 18:04.154
Honey?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.979
Number two is done.
Now, number three.

18:11.013 --> 18:15.563
We are 49 minutes behind schedule.
- Copy that.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.000
I always got that blue stuff ...

18:24.100 --> 18:28.376
this was on sale.
- I love that you're so economical.

18:28.377 --> 18:31.660
Maybe we should be sure
read the instructions.

18:35.283 --> 18:39.162
Is that Korean?
- No, Chinese.

18:39.197 --> 18:45.999
Chinese are icons.
- Is that so? Explosives are explosives.

18:46.591 --> 18:52.248
I come tonight to the airport ...

18:52.249 --> 18:56.960
My mother is sick and I stay with her.
Maybe we can go tomorrow. I love you.

19:00.882 --> 19:04.538
I have no one to call.
- No one? That is pathetic.

19:04.539 --> 19:09.017
Fuck it. This is the saddest
group of hostages that I have ever seen.

19:09.702 --> 19:13.567
Sit down and shut up.
- I just said that.

19:13.568 --> 19:16.007
I just left a message.

19:19.837 --> 19:23.577
As I predicted,
They have not killed us.

19:24.512 --> 19:26.951
Tripp was it?

19:26.952 --> 19:29.261
Do you want to apologize, because
You have provided us a terror?

19:29.897 --> 19:32.891
Why did they kill us?
- Why would they have to murder us?

19:32.892 --> 19:34.632
They have been convicted of a murder.
Why not ...

19:34.633 --> 19:37.792
all the witnesses murder?
I would do.

19:37.793 --> 19:40.002
Might think the robbers are
the other did it ...

19:40.003 --> 19:43.045
so they do not need to murder.
- It's express shot.

19:44.345 --> 19:47.822
We must find out who he is
and why he killed Jack Hayes.

19:48.852 --> 19:51.499
How do you know his name?

19:51.500 --> 19:55.407
Driver's license.
- You have a dead man's wallet stolen?

20:03.306 --> 20:06.311
Great.
Gates, you're up.

20:13.746 --> 20:17.885
Like a gun
in a brown paper bag need.

20:18.648 --> 20:21.394
Tell me about it.

20:27.701 --> 20:30.978
Do you see a clue?
- I do not know what profession they hold.

20:31.403 --> 20:34.244
His business cards are credit card,
his transfer pass ...

20:34.762 --> 20:39.244
Those are the Citibank, but
not just international.

20:39.545 --> 20:42.316
Why do we check him as he
has no business card?

20:40.817 --> 20:43.311
Maybe he has a
new account opened.

20:43.970 --> 20:47.328
Gordon, the computers
stood by the mainframe.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.155
Madge's money counting.

20:51.037 --> 20:54.835
A strict security guard at the door.
Looks at the lady ...

20:54.869 --> 20:59.264
held by the Office of the loans is.
Kaitlin is in her area.

20:59.266 --> 21:02.831
And Jack Hayes was ...

21:03.986 --> 21:08.523
Jack Hayes opened any new accounts.
He was to ogle at the desk.

21:08.524 --> 21:11.422
Otherwise he was to
a bank employee went.

21:11.423 --> 21:14.145
What was he doing here?

21:14.837 --> 21:17.205
I have no idea.

21:36.746 --> 21:39.846
I feel your breath.

21:43.197 --> 21:45.519
What are you doing?

21:45.520 --> 21:48.371
Hello, Tripp.
What are you doing?

21:48.372 --> 21:51.108
Looking for a way out.
- Did not you think they will murder us?

21:51.109 --> 21:53.831
I may just have your ring?
How long have you been engaged?

21:54.780 --> 21:57.605
That way we'll find out.
Why your wedding with Max?

21:57.606 --> 21:59.561
You know him do not agree.
- I know he is rich ...

21:59.562 --> 22:01.890
He can not meet your appetite for adventure
meet and your sense of humor ...

22:01.891 --> 22:04.416
He sexually satisfy you.

22:04.417 --> 22:07.554
She told me that he
his pants had been found. - Madge.

22:07.555 --> 22:09.554
She knows him for two months,
and I have not met him yet.

22:09.555 --> 22:12.062
Enough.
- There are four pictures of you on that drive.

22:12.063 --> 22:14.590
Three from Brazil. You're an adventurer.
Max is totally irrelevant.

22:14.591 --> 22:18.419
He was with the Banana.
He was badly burned. He remained in that day.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.014
The worst part is yours and Max for
his mansion.

22:21.015 --> 22:24.071
You are so small compared to that house.
He loves the house than yours there.

22:24.072 --> 22:26.876
Who are you?
- The most interesting thing about you is ...

22:26.877 --> 22:28.891
you are still working,
even though you do not need the money.

22:28.892 --> 22:30.461
You're an independent woman.
I like that.

22:30.462 --> 22:31.300
Count on that.
- If I did not use medication ...

22:31.302 --> 22:32.604
I'm not very good with ...
- People?

22:32.605 --> 22:35.440
Certainly not one I
wants to bed.

22:35.441 --> 22:39.320
And then I say such things.

22:52.556 --> 22:54.822
Stop it.

22:54.823 --> 22:58.758
Because of you we are all killed.

23:00.503 --> 23:04.079
Be still there.

23:10.173 --> 23:14.846
They call me Mr. Clean.
Where are you from?

23:16.780 --> 23:21.384
No English.
- That I have been. To "No English".

23:21.891 --> 23:25.965
That is close to 'No problem'.

23:31.303 --> 23:33.770
The trip.

23:37.486 --> 23:42.319
It can.
Come on it.

24:18.064 --> 24:20.574
Now we have to murder him.
- Calm down.

24:20.575 --> 24:23.159
Does your computer have?

24:23.160 --> 24:26.156
Yes, that still works.
- How much time do we lose them?

24:26.157 --> 24:28.294
Approximately one hour.

24:28.295 --> 24:31.047
Let us remember that safe
and we murder that shit.

24:31.048 --> 24:34.133
Then we crack ATMs.
- That is the blue color.

24:34.134 --> 24:37.579
This is the blue color.
- We need to do murder ...

24:37.582 --> 24:40.577
This slows us only.
A bullet in their brains.

24:50.466 --> 24:53.951
We have blown up the ATM?

24:53.952 --> 24:59.244
The biggest job you ever did.
You have just three bars ...

24:59.245 --> 25:02.833
dynamite eaten.
- Do we have blown up the ATM?

25:03.684 --> 25:06.311
Let me see.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.762
Do you want the good or the bad news?

25:15.763 --> 25:19.247
The good news.
- That is, we have blown the door.

25:19.947 --> 25:23.214
The bad news is,
that the ATM is intact.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.539
Two doors.

25:29.269 --> 25:32.948
I have not even pulled the trigger.
That thing just went off.

25:32.949 --> 25:35.709
On your knees.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.226
Facing forward.

25:40.227 --> 25:42.390
Hands behind your head.

25:42.391 --> 25:44.766
You're going to die, so you have
no extras required.

25:44.767 --> 25:49.080
Do you have any ideas?
- See you on the other side.

25:49.946 --> 25:55.432
You have to focus on the brains?
Then you have less junk or something?

25:55.433 --> 25:58.865
It was fun, man.

25:58.866 --> 26:03.125
Very nice. I had to
no one else to do.

26:03.126 --> 26:08.048
In practical terms, this is not a good idea.
- You said we could murder him.

26:08.049 --> 26:11.804
Let me see the place.
- If you blowing something next time ...

26:11.805 --> 26:14.642
let us know.
- You got it.

26:14.644 --> 26:18.938
I want to personally thank
that you do not murder.

26:18.939 --> 26:23.220
Are we going to murder them?
Are you crazy?

26:27.019 --> 26:32.624
Why are you out of the kitchen?
- We have to murder them all.

26:35.773 --> 26:39.670
You have missed.

26:39.671 --> 26:42.197
He has to grab you?
- What?

26:42.198 --> 26:46.214
Your ear.
- My ear?

26:46.215 --> 26:49.406
I mean that.

26:51.905 --> 26:54.798
Get ready to die.

26:54.799 --> 26:57.471
Shoot him.
- I will.

26:57.472 --> 27:02.269
Then I will shoot you down, and this circle
violence may continue forever.

27:02.270 --> 27:04.782
Come on, dick.
Do it.

27:05.619 --> 27:07.569
You want them to shoot me.

27:06.995 --> 27:10.616
We are better than that.

27:11.413 --> 27:17.806
Then I walk back.

27:18.570 --> 27:22.725
Gates, bring the hostages
to that office.

27:22.726 --> 27:24.845
Do it.

27:31.365 --> 27:35.543
Is it, good butter cookie?

27:49.814 --> 27:53.161
Why talk to a hostage against me?

27:53.262 --> 27:55.252
Somebody killed him,
and they will soon again a murder.

27:55.253 --> 27:58.495
The man with the jacket.
I was not. I was not in the right corner.

27:58.496 --> 28:01.864
Who had the good or corner?

28:01.865 --> 28:05.022
Are you Dwayne?
Pay attention to the hostages.

28:05.024 --> 28:08.117
Take it easy.
You're hyper.

28:08.118 --> 28:10.205
You need a sedative.

28:10.206 --> 28:13.538
What is wrong with you? I have a gun
on the back of your head.

28:15.830 --> 28:18.923
What were you talking about?
- They wanted to know ...

28:18.924 --> 28:21.445
if I thought you're the man
the jacket had been murdered.

28:21.446 --> 28:24.036
Really?
- Yes.

28:24.071 --> 28:26.728
Have you done that?
- No, we're professionals.

28:26.729 --> 28:30.446
If one of us the guy was killed,
The hostages would be dead.

28:30.447 --> 28:34.330
Why are there two bank robbers
killed at the same time?

28:34.331 --> 28:36.350
Are you kidding?
- No.

28:36.351 --> 28:39.531
At seven hours that computer guy
the whole security system is restarted.

28:39.532 --> 28:43.190
This is a new protocol. The whole
security was two minutes flat.

28:43.370 --> 28:45.711
That no more bank robbers
were here tonight I'm surprised.

28:45.712 --> 28:49.576
Darrien should know.
He knows that right?

28:50.090 --> 28:53.804
You tried to pry information out of me?
- Yes.

28:53.904 --> 28:58.171
You are Jack Hayes?
- In all my years of taking hostages ...

28:58.986 --> 29:01.964
you're by far the most annoying.

29:02.702 --> 29:05.742
I'm sorry.

29:07.276 --> 29:10.102
Go inside.

29:11.584 --> 29:15.678
Hello, computerman. Why you busy
but ten keys when you phoned your wife?

29:15.679 --> 29:17.895
What are you talking about?
- When she used the phone ...

29:17.994 --> 29:20.051
expressed in all ten buttons
and then connect. For eleven keys.

29:20.052 --> 29:22.135
You expressed only ten. I count everything.
Why do you do if your wife call you?

29:22.136 --> 29:24.612
You sold the information when the alarm
off was one of the criminals.

29:24.613 --> 29:26.229
Then you are greedy and you sold it again.

29:26.231 --> 29:29.077
Double money, double robbery.
Why did you not call your wife.

29:30.078 --> 29:33.161
Should I beat him up?
- Good practice when the police come.

29:31.162 --> 29:35.898
, We'll "water boarding".
I saw how to do it on Discovery Channel.

29:37.199 --> 29:41.809
I only need a mop and a pair of pliers.
- Wait a minute.

29:42.418 --> 29:44.481
I have sold the information.
- What?

29:43.982 --> 29:47.744
I've only done once.
And I do not even know to whom.

29:48.904 --> 29:50.848
I have the information faxed.
They gave me cash.

30:01.802 --> 30:05.890
And I did not kill Jack Hayes.
- Says no.

30:12.772 --> 30:17.231
We would already be.
- We need to break into this vault.

30:35.270 --> 30:39.025
It is not. According to the vault specifications
would be two inches thick.

30:39.026 --> 30:41.064
That is much thicker.

30:41.165 --> 30:45.627
How long does it take to burn through them?
- I do not know. Two hours?

30:45.628 --> 30:47.671
Are all your chores so bad?

30:47.672 --> 30:50.643
Should I worry if there is enough
gasoline in the van is?

30:50.644 --> 30:53.848
Look at me. We have cracked the timeslot.
We need you no longer need.

30:53.849 --> 30:56.417
You threaten me, little bald Jew?

30:56.834 --> 31:03.212
Jews have more small bald for humanity
done more than anyone else. Flicker is on.

31:03.248 --> 31:06.596
We will not do crazy things.
Hurry.

31:06.597 --> 31:09.663
Hurry.

31:09.265 --> 31:11.534
Relax.

31:14.229 --> 31:17.400
It never stops.
3000 years we pick that shit already

31:17.401 --> 31:19.894
I know.

31:19.929 --> 31:22.093
I am not an accountant or
a comedy writer ...

31:22.094 --> 31:25.544
or something very Jewish.
I am a bank robber.

31:26.088 --> 31:29.419
Do you know how many Jews there are bank robbers?
- Not much.

31:29.591 --> 31:33.729
Not very much. Even in this environment
they see only bagels and schmear ...

31:33.730 --> 31:36.031
and Goldman Sachs.

31:36.032 --> 31:39.564
We link or by fires.
It just takes a little longer.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.355
I do not know, D.

31:42.356 --> 31:46.126
We always said we would stop
if the information is incorrect.

31:46.127 --> 31:48.622
That safe specifications are incorrect,
We are behind schedule ...

31:48.623 --> 31:51.044
and then that idiot still Lancelot.

31:51.045 --> 31:54.983
Hilbilly two in the hallway with weapons
play and explosives.

31:54.984 --> 32:00.656
They have seen our faces.
Ten years ago we were stopped.

32:00.657 --> 32:04.965
Ten years ago there was no recession.

32:04.966 --> 32:09.325
In a few years we have 40.
That's 80 years in criminal.

32:09.326 --> 32:13.353
I'd already be inside.
I need the money more than ever.

32:13.354 --> 32:17.331
My little girl has just one bracket.
That Invisalign.

32:17.332 --> 32:20.380
Not that cheap ceramics.
9000.

32:20.381 --> 32:24.019
And they call us criminals.
We had to be dentist.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.071
We had to be dentist.
- Actually it orthodontist.

32:26.124 --> 32:32.195
Keep the hostages away, I start to
the link. It's us succeed.

32:32.649 --> 32:36.590
It always works.

32:42.370 --> 32:46.444
We stop the door from the C4 ...

32:46.445 --> 32:49.806
and blowing out the door.
- Like an open beer can.

32:51.451 --> 32:56.274
You are the dumbest bank robbers
I have ever seen.

32:56.275 --> 32:59.532
You have my ear 15 minutes ago
shot off ...

32:59.533 --> 33:03.346
So sorry, your comment goes one ear
and in my other out again.

33:07.035 --> 33:11.039
What?
- You only have one ear.

33:11.986 --> 33:16.770
That is a saying.
Are you doing with him?

33:17.204 --> 33:22.206
They can not come between us.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.671
They're trying to lower in rank.

33:24.672 --> 33:31.214
You Muppets have ranks?
- Absolutely.

33:31.215 --> 33:35.167
We've put you down.
- Want to bet?

33:35.168 --> 33:38.120
Go ahead.
- Come on it.

33:40.089 --> 33:45.665
That ranks them on the web.
- Are you still in Riverside?

33:46.137 --> 33:49.550
We are the Internet thundered.
Has that ever happened you?

33:49.552 --> 33:51.682
No, I've never
the Internet thundered.

33:51.683 --> 33:57.744
I have mixed feelings
about this whole experience.

33:58.936 --> 34:01.178
You see more clues?
- No, I have to get closer.

34:11.070 --> 34:14.585
Do you have ADHD or something?
- No.

34:14.587 --> 34:17.193
'm Not going on the defensive.
We all have stuff.

34:17.194 --> 34:20.668
I take no coincidence Sanax.
- Why do you Sanax?

34:21.699 --> 34:23.985
I do not know.
Nerves before the wedding I think.

34:23.987 --> 34:28.806
Max is not true for you.
- Yeah, that must be it.

34:28.808 --> 34:29.870
What you swallow?
- What I do not swallow.

34:30.771 --> 34:32.956
Illegal or prescription?
- All prescription.

34:32.958 --> 34:35.799
Illegal junk I do not trust.

34:36.425 --> 34:39.547
Where you take it for?

34:42.071 --> 34:44.896
Well, then you tell me.

34:44.445 --> 34:47.125
It turns the TV off.
- Interesting.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.860
Would you tell?
- How do I explain that?

34:49.862 --> 34:53.295
I've seen hundreds of doctors.
They have hundreds of diagnoses.

34:53.295 --> 34:57.128
Not that I'm crazy,
but it's like ...

34:59.369 --> 35:02.824
There are a lot of TVs and they are
All other station ...

35:02.825 --> 35:05.107
a normal person ...

35:05.108 --> 35:08.432
concentrate on one, I take it
all at once to me.

35:08.433 --> 35:11.320
Can you expand?
- No.

35:11.321 --> 35:15.009
I wish I could.
I've tried everything.

35:18.151 --> 35:20.780
Switch channels?
- No.

35:20.781 --> 35:23.717
Tricky.
- Yes.

35:23.718 --> 35:27.055
You know what they say.
Normal but the kitchen sink and washing machine.

35:27.056 --> 35:30.511
A fool would say,
not a normal person.

35:36.073 --> 35:39.954
This is the list of the FBI for
most wanted bank robbers.

35:39.955 --> 35:43.505
Number one, Vicellous Drum.
He's overrated.

35:43.507 --> 35:46.883
I do not know.
He was never caught.

35:46.884 --> 35:49.015
The most stolen.
The largest ratio.

35:49.016 --> 35:53.495
Jobs are running smoothly.
Like fat people who run to the buffet.

35:51.494 --> 35:56.411
Look at the Baltimore job.
20 people dead. That's pretty excessive.

35:56.412 --> 35:59.528
He takes it into millions.

35:59.531 --> 36:04.450
Number two is Mick Nylon and his gang.
Number three, Alexis Black.

36:04.451 --> 36:08.174
She is good for a girl.
And Darrien and Weinstein at 12.

36:08.175 --> 36:12.582
They have been doing it 15 years.
They have much more recognition than I am.

36:14.004 --> 36:17.379
I am.
68 place as a bank robber.

36:17.380 --> 36:21.082
But if four cybercriminal.

36:21.183 --> 36:25.101
Now I can say ...

36:25.201 --> 36:30.032
My ear is shot off
the fourth cyber criminals in the country.

36:30.033 --> 36:33.320
Will you be shooting my finger?

36:33.624 --> 36:36.985
Hit me just now?

36:36.986 --> 36:40.367
Where are we?

36:41.051 --> 36:46.184
Number 674?

36:46.185 --> 36:48.804
They have probably ...

36:48.806 --> 36:50.618
Excluding the international job.

36:50.619 --> 36:53.532
We had a Kwik-Fit robberies in Winnipeg.

36:53.533 --> 36:57.018
Who is here.
You have been arrested in Sagamore ...

36:57.118 --> 36:58.517
when your car broke down.

36:58.552 --> 37:03.077
We had blown the engine.
- Once you have raided a Kwik-Fit?

37:03.078 --> 37:05.878
So ironic it's not for us.

37:08.220 --> 37:12.879
I have broken their chains.
They're going to murder me.

37:14.747 --> 37:15.721
You can still state witness,
then enter the prison.

37:15.722 --> 37:18.007
Should I feel better?

37:18.008 --> 37:21.574
The tank is not so bad.
There are not many gay men.

37:24.005 --> 37:26.800
For you maybe.
You do look delicious.

37:29.144 --> 37:32.716
Disgusting.
Come and help.

37:36.634 --> 37:39.162
They have already learned that you
the detector are?

37:42.819 --> 37:45.531
Come on.

37:45.532 --> 37:50.050
Come on.
Get out.

37:55.257 --> 37:59.104
Gates, you rule the toilet breaks even.
I gotta give this guy some Rennies.

37:59.105 --> 38:03.142
Sorry, guys.
See you later.

38:24.827 --> 38:29.813
We put the things on edge.
Tonight it will happen.

38:37.819 --> 38:41.060
You need the latest bloated.

38:41.061 --> 38:45.147
You have also taken one for the team,
with your ears and stuff.

38:46.033 --> 38:50.054
I have an idea.

38:50.971 --> 38:53.901
Can we borrow one of the hostages?

38:53.902 --> 38:58.474
Half of us anyway.
- You want to choose?

39:01.179 --> 39:04.512
All.

39:05.504 --> 39:09.695
I take that beauty.
- They are all beautiful.

39:09.696 --> 39:15.642
I take that cue and mustache Remans.

39:15.643 --> 39:19.234
That black chick, that creep,
gay and who goes with you.

39:19.317 --> 39:21.452
What?
- I must go to the bathroom.

39:21.453 --> 39:24.355
Should you piss again?

39:24.356 --> 39:29.386
Is there something wrong with your pecker?
- I have some kind of problem.

39:29.387 --> 39:31.828
Then go ahead.

39:37.279 --> 39:42.318
In connection with the team spirit we welcome ...
- Mistic Lightning.

39:42.319 --> 39:45.061
Not Mystic Lightning.
I hate that name.

39:45.062 --> 39:50.168
"Ties" is cool? Who are blind tunnel.
Rodents living on garbage and excrement.

39:50.169 --> 39:52.214
These are not inspiring animals.

39:52.215 --> 39:55.997
You should choose Peanut Butter and Jelly.
I choose this.

39:55.474 --> 39:58.106
For our first activity ...

39:58.107 --> 40:00.914
We need a very special tie ...

40:00.915 --> 40:03.306
that, if possible, can read Chinese.

40:03.307 --> 40:07.332
For some totally harmless explosives
for us to explode.

40:07.333 --> 40:10.747
So if you ask, we get
not volunteer.

40:10.748 --> 40:12.940
What?
- I can see Jack Hayes.

40:12.941 --> 40:15.259
See?

40:15.260 --> 40:18.749
He's dead. You can do nothing for him.
- You love me.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.588
I'm not crazy about you.
- I have heard no gunshot.

40:22.591 --> 40:27.293
How will Max react to this?
You mutilate yourself. I do not care.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.388
Get out.

40:31.532 --> 40:34.541
I'm not gay.
- Now is the time for it.

40:46.032 --> 40:48.619
This must happen.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.950
You put the primer in the C4.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.465
You run to a safe place ...

40:53.466 --> 40:56.231
and I push in the igniter.

40:56.232 --> 40:58.211
This is really happening.

40:58.212 --> 41:01.693
Igniter in the C4.
A gigantic explosion.

41:01.694 --> 41:06.370
You will be thrown by the bank,
and we find you than in the rubble.

41:06.476 --> 41:09.294
Success.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.748
Go ahead.

41:21.923 --> 41:26.191
He is not the smartest.
- No.

42:11.166 --> 42:15.052
New rules now
we only rob people.

42:15.054 --> 42:17.970
This is absurd.

42:29.859 --> 42:33.904
Of course they are locked.

42:33.905 --> 42:37.811
Why this man hates us?

42:39.855 --> 42:43.086
I found a few pennies.

42:43.087 --> 42:46.542
Pennies.
The dumbest currency on the planet.

42:46.543 --> 42:51.507
It looks a bit better.
I just found some pennies.

42:52.727 --> 42:56.263
That way.

42:57.244 --> 42:59.561
Drop the gun.

42:59.562 --> 43:03.952
You heard him. Drop it.
- Put the gun down.

43:03.953 --> 43:07.756
Put that gun down.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.829
Put it down.

43:13.572 --> 43:17.261
Drop the gun.

43:19.826 --> 43:23.125
Now let the gun fall.
- What is it?

43:23.126 --> 43:28.088
Drop the gun.
- It? Who was with him.

43:25.589 --> 43:29.718
The origin of the gun
I'm not interested.

43:29.719 --> 43:32.459
Put it on the ground.

43:36.632 --> 43:38.213
You're kidding.

43:38.214 --> 43:43.054
We are the youngest team here ...

43:43.055 --> 43:47.942
We want you to your guns
us, if we focus on your gun.

43:48.743 --> 43:54.572
This is an FBI gun?
- FBI? That's interesting.

43:55.656 --> 43:59.527
FBI agent tried this bank
also to rob?

44:00.689 --> 44:02.226
Or someone he studied?

44:02.227 --> 44:08.198
There are at least five
wanted criminals. - What is happening here?

44:09.410 --> 44:12.063
Got it?
- No.

44:12.715 --> 44:16.676
I have that missing piece
found in your ear.

44:16.677 --> 44:18.234
If anything you, I care for you.

44:16.835 --> 44:20.038
Peanut Butter and Jelly were
to the front door.

44:20.039 --> 44:22.944
Darrien and Gates came down the stairs.
Bullets flew from north to south.

44:22.945 --> 44:24.987
Blood splattered from east to west.
We were stuck in the crossfire.

44:24.988 --> 44:25.696
North, south.

44:25.698 --> 44:27.505
Darrien and Gates took the wrong exit.

44:28.321 --> 44:30.875
Peanut Butter and Jelly too.

44:32.124 --> 44:34.833
The FBI came, Jack Hayes was the pipe.

44:34.834 --> 44:38.679
Only two people had it so
shoot. Mitchell, the computer guy.

44:38.680 --> 44:42.256
He was unarmed.
If you omit this option ...

44:42.257 --> 44:44.613
there is only one other possibility.

44:44.614 --> 44:47.648
The killer must ...

44:50.612 --> 44:52.910
Be Weinstein.

45:20.629 --> 45:23.273
They each shot.

45:23.274 --> 45:28.599
No, he can not be faster than Weinstein.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.954
Where does he get a gun and
a silencer from?

45:30.955 --> 45:36.222
Weinstein was furious because the computer guy
two parties invited.

45:36.223 --> 45:39.238
And that computer guy is furious because
Weinstein that FBI guy killed.

45:39.239 --> 45:42.497
They confront each other, pulling
their guns and go both dead.

45:42.498 --> 45:44.605
Why Weinstein confront him?

45:44.606 --> 45:48.581
Why would an FBI guy Weinstein
murder in the middle of a bank robbery?

45:48.582 --> 45:54.068
That asshole surprise.
- The computer guy has two bullets in it.

45:54.069 --> 45:56.809
Maybe someone, someone else
surprise in a different way.

45:56.810 --> 45:59.595
If it was not a confrontation,
if they were friends?

45:59.596 --> 46:03.984
Watch what you say,
when you talk about my friend.

46:04.019 --> 46:06.587
He would never betray me.

46:06.593 --> 46:11.260
We have been together 15 years.
That means something in this kind of work.

46:11.261 --> 46:17.285
There people had access to the kitchen,
Peanut Butter and Jelly where only ...

46:18.591 --> 46:24.376
and you, Gates had access to the kitchen.
- And the hostages up in the attic.

46:24.899 --> 46:27.874
Crawling up the hostages are now in the attic around?
- This job is over.

46:27.875 --> 46:31.144
Wait here.
Darrien, listen.

46:48.878 --> 46:51.625
That's odd.

47:00.627 --> 47:04.122
What do we do now?

47:04.123 --> 47:09.590
I have nothing.
I'm just this piece of ear ...

47:09.591 --> 47:15.684
in the freezer.
- I swear ...

47:15.685 --> 47:19.057
if you're a woman,
I would marry you.

47:19.058 --> 47:22.965
I am not.

47:30.656 --> 47:33.251
You go with me down.

47:33.252 --> 47:36.584
Where's the remote?
We need them to get out of this.

47:36.585 --> 47:40.043
A few more corpses.
We change the plan.

47:40.044 --> 47:44.893
Therefore let this job go.
- You know what they say about plans?

47:44.894 --> 47:48.704
If you want God to laugh,
tell him all about your plans.

47:48.705 --> 47:53.099
Believe me, who is himself
there are broken laugh.

47:53.100 --> 47:58.403
Nothing in this rotten bank
goes according to plan.

47:58.404 --> 48:01.705
Where's the remote?
- Weinstein him.

48:01.706 --> 48:04.036
What has he left?
- I do not know.

48:04.037 --> 48:04.979
Take it easy and listen to me.

48:04.980 --> 48:07.243
We had to go away long ago.

48:07.244 --> 48:10.541
It's over. - We have
needed to break the link.

48:10.543 --> 48:12.015
I need to get away.

48:12.016 --> 48:16.659
I want to stay here and rob that bank.
- The bank job is fucked up.

48:16.660 --> 48:21.516
You and me on a desert island,
drinking, lots of chicks ...

48:21.517 --> 48:25.530
Think about it.

48:27.663 --> 48:32.051
The boat is gone, only the engine is still there.

48:32.052 --> 48:38.310
This affects your common sense.

48:38.311 --> 48:40.751
I thought you had balls.

48:40.752 --> 48:44.126
You're a disgrace to the black criminals.

49:02.835 --> 49:06.072
Tonight was a fucking mess.
But not anymore.

49:06.073 --> 49:11.629
There's only one gang robbers.
Three of us.

49:11.630 --> 49:15.816
Mystic Lightning Can we be?
- No, you're Muppet.

49:17.837 --> 49:21.734
No excuse, no more favors,
no gentle treatment.

49:21.735 --> 49:24.802
It is now for real.

49:26.800 --> 49:32.014
Because there is only one army,
There is even a general.

49:32.015 --> 49:35.765
I am the General.

49:36.948 --> 49:42.215
I have complete control.
Nothing happens without my say so.

49:59.850 --> 50:02.977
Bring the hostages out of the office.

50:05.078 --> 50:09.525
Hurry.
- You heard him.

50:10.755 --> 50:12.924
Do you have thermal lance
disabled?

50:12.925 --> 50:17.248
You do not appear?
- No.

50:17.993 --> 50:22.191
What's next?
We begin with the vault ...

50:22.192 --> 50:28.384
or murder us all hostages?
- Definitely the vault.

50:28.385 --> 50:31.147
Hostages may be useful.

50:31.185 --> 50:34.146
You can use them as human
shields ...

50:34.147 --> 50:39.351
things they can get you.
As the money from the bank. Or snacks.

50:40.279 --> 50:43.107
We start with the safe.
On one condition ...

50:44.068 --> 50:48.286
if the time has come to do it,
I do it alone.

50:50.281 --> 50:55.746
That should not be a problem.
We are not like the mass murders.

50:55.747 --> 51:00.062
If you are in being so,
is not a problem for us.

51:00.993 --> 51:03.584
Come on then.

51:14.469 --> 51:16.544
This is so much better than first class
flying, drinking champagne and ...

51:16.645 --> 51:19.732
and go to my wedding.
- If you can walk out the bank with the money ...

51:19.733 --> 51:24.508
Max would you still need?
- You must let go.

51:24.509 --> 51:26.887
I can not let go.
I'm obsessive.

51:26.889 --> 51:30.088
If you had the money,
Max would still be?

51:30.089 --> 51:33.511
He holds the door open for you?
He hugs you at night?

51:33.512 --> 51:35.832
I do not like to cuddle? - Is he
the weekend to Mom and Dad?

51:35.833 --> 51:39.759
My mother loves him. - Everyone
says you can not buy happiness with money.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.394
Nobody really believes that.

51:41.395 --> 51:45.943
Your tenacity is touching.
As I exit I go back to Max.

51:45.944 --> 51:50.359
I continue with this for five hours.
- No, I'm saying.

51:53.556 --> 51:58.926
The thermal lance is blown,
so we use the c4 for the link.

51:58.927 --> 52:01.231
We are all to
the controlled explosion.

52:01.232 --> 52:04.148
That would be something different.

52:04.149 --> 52:07.463
I want you to know that I am
not use your explosives.

52:07.464 --> 52:09.524
We know.

52:15.339 --> 52:18.478
Go look at it.

52:19.249 --> 52:25.257
No unexpected things,
No dynamite ...

52:25.293 --> 52:30.101
or apache helicopters and no nuclear weapons.
- Now go and see.

52:30.102 --> 52:33.146
Whoever it is, shoot them.

52:38.045 --> 52:40.437
Why he always throws scissors?

52:40.438 --> 52:44.835
Why, Jelly.
Why?

52:44.871 --> 52:47.677
Do not throw scissors, but with stones.

53:03.449 --> 53:06.671
Is there anyone?

53:16.701 --> 53:20.954
I know you're there.
I will not shoot you, Tripp.

53:25.390 --> 53:28.130
I just want the bank but robberies.

53:29.199 --> 53:33.823
I do not know what happens.
- With the raid?

53:33.824 --> 53:38.189
Yes, with the raid and everything.

53:38.190 --> 53:40.850
I would now be the happiest guy
world should be.

53:40.851 --> 53:45.589
I have a great job, working with
my best friend. The hours are ideal.

53:45.590 --> 53:47.939
We have never been on people
having to shoot.

53:47.944 --> 53:50.639
We've never seen anyone
need to murder.

53:52.899 --> 53:56.078
It's strange to all those things against
a photocopier to say.

53:56.780 --> 54:00.187
I will not be negative.

54:00.881 --> 54:03.405
I'm just saying ...

54:03.406 --> 54:07.915
Maybe I'm not good at
bank clerk.

54:07.916 --> 54:11.828
Perhaps Jesus has me here
not put on earth.

54:11.829 --> 54:15.077
My grandfather sold illegal liquor.

54:15.078 --> 54:18.070
My father was a sex offender.

54:18.071 --> 54:21.190
Criminals is in my blood.

54:21.849 --> 54:27.894
Between you and me, it was always my dream
been to work at a water park.

54:28.580 --> 54:30.980
I hear you.

54:31.594 --> 54:34.596
For what it's worth, I find
a great bank robber.

54:35.143 --> 54:37.081
Are you serious?

54:37.082 --> 54:40.545
You say no, because I have a gun
I focused on your dick?

54:40.548 --> 54:43.316
Nothing that went wrong
is your fault.

54:44.326 --> 54:48.542
You are sabotaged.
Take it easy.

54:48.543 --> 54:50.657
I let you see something.

54:51.664 --> 54:54.874
Where did you get that?

54:54.875 --> 54:57.327
Which I took from your suitcase stolen.

54:57.328 --> 55:01.464
Look, even if each transmitter
suffer from interference.

55:02.451 --> 55:06.387
The ignition should work.

55:07.118 --> 55:09.877
No.
Who has changed?

55:09.878 --> 55:12.750
Leader, are you okay?
- Who is your leader?

55:12.751 --> 55:15.939
I must not tell you.
- Who has it changed, to murder you.

55:15.940 --> 55:21.893
It's like leader,
or Peanut Butter.

55:23.143 --> 55:26.964
Peanut Butter is a brother to me.

55:29.063 --> 55:32.810
Peanut Butter and I are like best
gay friends in a bathtub.

55:32.811 --> 55:35.549
We are so close.

55:36.536 --> 55:41.452
A lot of money in the bank.
You need it from different angles.

55:43.731 --> 55:48.053
He knew from the freezer, even though
we not been in that kitchen.

55:48.755 --> 55:51.139
Let me tackle
it was in the kitchen.

55:51.853 --> 55:56.656
Who is your leader?
You can trust me.

55:56.775 --> 55:59.613
Who is your leader?

56:01.345 --> 56:04.563
Here.
Take a look.

56:05.093 --> 56:08.828
Vicellous Drum.
We have never met him.

56:08.829 --> 56:13.963
The text is clear, the information is correct.
Never has our face. Just a fax.

56:13.964 --> 56:18.198
Is that normal? Receive a fax?
- You thought surely emails?

56:18.199 --> 56:21.513
The police pull these things after.

56:21.515 --> 56:24.667
They store about anti-fax technology.

56:24.668 --> 56:25.165
Everyone loves the comedians
the hard copy.

56:25.785 --> 56:27.355
I do not want to scare you.

56:27.356 --> 56:32.097
Do you think there is something
the conspiracy theory?

56:32.666 --> 56:37.995
I want to wipe out anyone's character ...

56:37.996 --> 56:42.927
I have Rex as he caught the vault
the measure was.

56:42.928 --> 56:44.834
I asked what he was doing,
and then he said ...

56:44.835 --> 56:47.980
that he was watching and lots of space
was for the new foreign currency.

56:47.981 --> 56:52.140
What weird.
He would know if the system was flat.

56:52.821 --> 56:55.845
He would have known.

56:55.846 --> 57:00.951
He has repeatedly told us that he
an expert in the bank robbery procedures.

57:00.952 --> 57:04.977
You're right.
- It's so crazy.

57:04.978 --> 57:07.520
That is so.

57:11.845 --> 57:14.348
Has anyone seen my insulin injection?

57:17.456 --> 57:21.277
Grab a chair.

57:21.279 --> 57:25.000
Does anyone have sugar?
- I do not candy.

57:25.651 --> 57:27.657
Hold his head.

57:28.370 --> 57:31.476
Fire!

57:31.747 --> 57:33.158
Fire!

57:33.592 --> 57:35.701
Where?
- The man ...

57:35.702 --> 57:40.646
Glucose is necessary or he dies
and I get it anyway. Come on.

57:40.647 --> 57:42.240
All right.

57:40.341 --> 57:42.095
Where's the fire?

57:42.915 --> 57:45.564
You often work with Vicellous Drum guy?
- Yes.

57:45.565 --> 57:47.293
We were once decoys for 'm.

57:47.294 --> 57:51.622
We had from him a bench robbery
while he 's safe in the big city did.

57:51.626 --> 57:59.049
It was unfortunate that no money was,
out of 80 Canadian dollars.

57:59.050 --> 58:03.086
Mr. Blythe's got low sugar.
We should seek immediate glucose.

58:10.590 --> 58:12.394
Where's my gun?

58:16.844 --> 58:21.705
Look over the edge.
As we crossed into the cell.

58:21.540 --> 58:25.092
Wait, have you ever been?
And you monitor his bank?

58:25.093 --> 58:28.264
Yes, I have some
omission on my resume.

58:28.265 --> 58:30.727
What have you been?
- Bank Heist.

58:30.729 --> 58:33.294
And other offenses.

58:33.295 --> 58:35.698
I have often done to mail fraud.

58:35.925 --> 58:38.761
They were not big banks.
- How much?

58:38.862 --> 58:41.556
A few. Thousand.
- My God.

58:41.557 --> 58:43.304
Take it easy.

58:43.305 --> 58:46.293
I am rehabilitated and stuff.

58:46.364 --> 58:48.319
Are you single?

58:51.444 --> 58:52.569
I think it is.

59:06.635 --> 59:09.199
He must wake up normally, right?

59:09.200 --> 59:11.007
He starts to open his eyes.

59:11.008 --> 59:13.108
He's a tough old man.

59:13.981 --> 59:16.009
Would you sit up?
- Ready?

59:18.355 --> 59:21.887
I close the doors for
the last time. Clear?

59:22.497 --> 59:27.432
Is that clear, assholes?

59:27.433 --> 59:30.394
I do not like that word.
- What did you just say?

59:30.395 --> 59:31.728
I hate the K-word.

59:31.729 --> 59:36.936
Say that again and I cut you ...
- I said I hate the K-word ...

59:36.937 --> 59:39.576
and use in America
we never!

59:39.577 --> 59:41.791
The Australians are damn.

59:41.792 --> 59:46.711
He has the same gun as you.
- That's my weapon.

59:48.908 --> 59:52.135
This is what you need fixed?
- What is the hell?

59:52.138 --> 59:54.350
That is our way.

59:54.351 --> 59:57.218
What do you want? Part?
- We talk outside.

59:54.719 --> 59:58.259
Hands behind your head.

59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.231
Out.

01:00:00.233 --> 01:00:02.846
Calmly.
- Maniac.

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:04.852
You've made your point.
- Why?

01:00:04.853 --> 01:00:08.464
Unless you have something to be
negotiate, say.

01:00:08.465 --> 01:00:11.466
Weinstein was our informant.
I have never met our leader.

01:00:11.467 --> 01:00:13.119
How have you contacted?
- That I will not say.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.704
Would you leave?
Answer to my question.

01:00:16.705 --> 01:00:20.925
Look, we have only this fax.

01:00:20.926 --> 01:00:23.858
I switch on the remote.

01:00:23.859 --> 01:00:26.383
Calmly.
- Get up.

01:00:26.384 --> 01:00:28.324
Give me the remote.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:34.545
Now give me the damn gun.
- It's Jelly his weapon.

01:00:34.546 --> 01:00:36.586
It was from his mother.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.499
Is it 's weapon of your mother?

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.213
I give it to you.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.232
I'm sorry.

01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:50.830
You lose that damn gun now?
- No.

01:00:50.831 --> 01:00:54.784
Are you fucking crazy?
You lose your gun privileges.

01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:57.090
Forwards.

01:00:57.983 --> 01:01:01.880
Jesus. And you.
I do not want to hear from you.

01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:04.778
One word, and you're dead.

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.503
Go back.
- Thanks.

01:01:07.509 --> 01:01:09.117
Back to work.

01:01:09.118 --> 01:01:11.447
My god.
- What was that about?

01:01:11.448 --> 01:01:14.671
I like the remote
exchanged with this fax.

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:16.401
And that 's good deal?
- No idea.

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:18.705
That's why I kept the battery with me.

01:01:19.312 --> 01:01:23.127
Mr. Blythe told me he saw Rex
the vault of the measurement was.

01:01:23.128 --> 01:01:25.439
I have seen.

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:28.241
Where is the Swiss girl?

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:32.245
The Swiss maid is not there.
- It happens.

01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:34.147
What then?

01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:38.766
Faxes, the night vision?
- What are you talking about?

01:01:38.767 --> 01:01:41.516
Five, six ...
- Stop counting.

01:01:41.517 --> 01:01:44.875
Tripp, stop!

01:01:49.014 --> 01:01:50.438
What?
- Why did you do that?

01:01:50.439 --> 01:01:53.806
Because you might as bright ...
- No, it does not work!

01:01:53.807 --> 01:01:57.877
For God's sake.
- I think of a thousand things.

01:01:57.878 --> 01:02:00.475
And now I have the kiss
think. Are you serious?

01:02:00.476 --> 01:02:04.055
My God! My brain will explode.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:14.148
He's crazy, but has talent.

01:02:14.149 --> 01:02:18.338
Indeed, he is a criminal genius.

01:02:18.745 --> 01:02:22.524
We are blessed.
- Can we help?

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:27.169
A soft drink without sugar?

01:02:27.436 --> 01:02:30.694
Go somewhere else.

01:02:38.752 --> 01:02:42.257
One more hour.
We will make it.

01:02:42.937 --> 01:02:45.484
The only people murdered
criminals are provisional.

01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:48.235
They can kill themselves.

01:02:48.726 --> 01:02:52.017
We are heroic survivors,
as I call it.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:58.059
Starting tomorrow, everyone
one week vacation.

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:02.939
I have next week Fri
- Then we'll have "a week business.

01:03:06.977 --> 01:03:11.586
We're not safe.
- You want me just do not agree.

01:03:12.365 --> 01:03:13.868
No.

01:03:19.315 --> 01:03:21.571
What's in her bra?
- I take it well.

01:03:21.572 --> 01:03:23.540
Wait.

01:03:24.455 --> 01:03:26.518
Do it.
- This is disgusting.

01:03:28.664 --> 01:03:31.821
Forward, pull it out.

01:03:35.892 --> 01:03:38.263
She works in a Swiss bank?

01:03:40.631 --> 01:03:43.278
What a waste.

01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:46.654
It is especially sad
like a nice girl dies.

01:03:46.655 --> 01:03:51.990
If an ugly girl dies
was their life sucks anyway.

01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:55.590
But if a nice girl dies
is it really 's tragedy.

01:03:55.593 --> 01:04:00.187
Indeed. Nice girls are
unicorns and gnomes.

01:04:00.188 --> 01:04:03.690
Rare and valuable.
They must be protected.

01:04:04.281 --> 01:04:07.064
My god.
- What?

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.256
This is not a bank robbery.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.857
This is not a bank robbery!

01:04:27.858 --> 01:04:29.793
You're fucking dead.

01:04:29.794 --> 01:04:33.886
Hakuna Matata, asshole.

01:04:30.907 --> 01:04:34.464
Listen, and I give you back primer.

01:04:34.893 --> 01:04:36.069
Well.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.758
These are the two faxes to you
these bank robberies.

01:04:41.759 --> 01:04:43.804
This is the fax to the Swiss girl.
They are different ...

01:04:42.705 --> 01:04:46.911
except that they are each 81 mm
have a blank line.

01:04:46.912 --> 01:04:48.966
The printer had a scratch.
- I do not understand.

01:04:48.967 --> 01:04:50.831
Neither do I.
- Printed by the same device?

01:04:50.432 --> 01:04:54.116
By the same person.
- Who?

01:04:54.117 --> 01:04:56.304
Vicellous Drum.
- Who is that?

01:04:56.305 --> 01:05:01.687
The number one criminal mastermind.
Those clever bastards.

01:05:01.688 --> 01:05:04.829
This is an organized trap.

01:05:04.475 --> 01:05:06.196
Vicellous Drum has a problem.

01:05:06.197 --> 01:05:08.361
He goes' n lots of people killed
associated with him are ...

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.160
but it may not seem that he
is behind it.

01:05:10.161 --> 01:05:15.294
Each of us is connected
with the criminal?

01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:17.439
Yes. Let me explain.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.037
If this is true, the FBI agent searches
Drum for years.

01:05:21.038 --> 01:05:23.056
Darrien and Weinstein have already
previously worked for Drum.

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:26.060
The Swiss bank representative
Drum money laundering.

01:05:26.061 --> 01:05:27.959
Mitchell Woolf is his Drum
computer hacker.

01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:30.719
Peanut Butter and Jelly
have him working as decoys.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.723
They may be able to reveal all.
And all the rest, who knows ...

01:05:33.724 --> 01:05:36.944
Perhaps Mr. Blythe met Drum
alone, making him angry.

01:05:36.945 --> 01:05:41.900
He was offended. Maybe flirt Mr Clean
with him in a prison shower.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:44.490
A blowjob in prison
he does not survive.

01:05:44.502 --> 01:05:46.291
Perhaps we are here by mistake.

01:05:46.292 --> 01:05:49.666
Collateral damage.
- You're kidding.

01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:54.362
Hoping that we kill each other?
This is sloppy, especially for Drum.

01:05:54.363 --> 01:05:56.967
That's why he is here, personally.

01:05:56.968 --> 01:05:59.732
Come on.
- Think about it. The thermal lance.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.397
The explosives went off at the exact time.

01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:07.161
The FBI agent was the largest
Drum threat.

01:06:07.162 --> 01:06:09.319
He left Weinstein him first kill.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:14.709
Yes, Weinstein worked for Drum
from the beginning.

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:17.213
Like Mitchell, who knew
ceded as security.

01:06:17.214 --> 01:06:19.257
Drum and then killed them.

01:06:24.533 --> 01:06:26.561
Drum had the best possible
in a double murder seems ...

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.213
but the remote Weinstein
his mouth was very suspicious.

01:06:31.214 --> 01:06:34.344
I guess Weinstein him in
his mouth was blocked ...

01:06:34.345 --> 01:06:37.551
to avoid the real killer,
Vicellous Drum, the bank could escape.

01:06:37.554 --> 01:06:41.099
Then inactivated by Darrien Drum.

01:06:40.187 --> 01:06:43.501
And then shot Drum
Swiss girl dead.

01:06:43.538 --> 01:06:45.896
Five dead, eight to go.

01:06:45.898 --> 01:06:51.607
What a fucking bullshit.
Nice story.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.876
It's not open.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:57.466
The money is yours to fly paper
here to lure and kill you.

01:06:58.172 --> 01:07:02.940
There is no money.
- Of course there is money. Shut up.

01:07:02.941 --> 01:07:09.138
Really, we've been working too hard.
- This is not a bank robbery.

01:07:20.571 --> 01:07:21.841
Damn.

01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:28.656
This is the best bank robbery ever.
- You said there was no money, eh?

01:07:28.755 --> 01:07:32.383
It's just fly paper.
- Yeah, I guess.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.230
Jeez.

01:07:39.231 --> 01:07:42.804
My god ...

01:07:46.701 --> 01:07:50.783
So it does not matter that the money is here,
Drum because everyone is dead?

01:07:50.883 --> 01:07:53.711
We love to 't be.

01:07:53.786 --> 01:07:56.188
I do not know who of you
Drum is ...

01:07:57.883 --> 01:08:00.633
but keep me away.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.225
Grab a gun?
- No, it does not matter.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:22.453
Drum his plan was always to everyone
murder. We must be smarter than him.

01:08:22.455 --> 01:08:23.363
How to kill so many armed people?

01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:26.121
Lights, night viewers,
and kill everyone.

01:08:26.122 --> 01:08:30.004
Why do I get there not?
- You said something about night vision.

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:32.639
In the bathroom there is one.
- What more do you need then?

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:35.390
Which man will get night vision goggles,
Drum's.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:37.805
Or any woman.

01:08:45.495 --> 01:08:48.761
How do we get it all in there?

01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:53.738
How much do you think this is?
- Four or five million.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.037
Let us begin.

01:09:03.255 --> 01:09:07.638
Really? Now go save the Bank?
- No, I want with you.

01:09:07.639 --> 01:09:09.939
There is "one damn killer.

01:09:09.942 --> 01:09:12.937
I'm going too.
- Me too.

01:09:12.938 --> 01:09:15.662
Do not forget me.
- We are all here.

01:09:15.663 --> 01:09:17.837
Let each other holding hands.

01:09:17.837 --> 01:09:21.868
Seriously. You never get away.

01:09:21.868 --> 01:09:25.904
Do not say Amen to that sort of thing.
You will frighten Jelly.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:31.953
Tripp is actually right.
That remote has no battery.

01:09:30.697 --> 01:09:34.783
Are you kidding?
What bastard has the battery?

01:09:35.014 --> 01:09:37.212
Vicellous Drum.

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:42.407
You took the battery to us here
to keep.

01:09:42.408 --> 01:09:45.127
No.
- You wander through the bank.

01:09:45.127 --> 01:09:49.611
You could at any time someone
have slain. The perfect crime ...

01:09:49.612 --> 01:09:55.249
you solve yourself.
Unbelievable that I kissed.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.006
You should not take a genius to
to come under your skirts.

01:09:58.007 --> 01:10:00.284
Flatter yourself that you would get this far.

01:09:59.985 --> 01:10:03.433
If the rest of you idiots had
Attention, did you realize ...

01:10:03.434 --> 01:10:07.032
that all the evidence point to Madge.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:28.644
Not true.

01:10:46.665 --> 01:10:50.485
Who turned out the light?
- Come on. Not again.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:02.627
Shoot everything that moves.

01:11:06.616 --> 01:11:09.842
Where is he?
- We 't seen.

01:11:43.521 --> 01:11:45.146
Come out.

01:11:45.821 --> 01:11:49.577
Forwards.

01:11:49.578 --> 01:11:53.173
I'm not Vicellous Drum.

01:11:53.703 --> 01:11:56.185
I took the lights off because I knew
that the real viewer would drum the night out.

01:11:56.254 --> 01:11:59.460
Then I went to the bathroom
and I waited.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.369
A bank manager
a golden heart.

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:16.022
Everyone is surprised
when they hear it's you.

01:12:17.273 --> 01:12:19.302
You think?

01:12:20.808 --> 01:12:23.943
Those clowns in the lobby thinking
that you're Vicellous Drum.

01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:29.006
They will kill you,
so they are more a hero like.

01:12:29.007 --> 01:12:33.529
If you kill me,
you seem even more Drum.

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:37.217
So, you're lapping anyway.

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:49.855
A very entertaining story,
but nobody believes it.

01:12:49.856 --> 01:12:54.259
Come on out.
Enough lies, it's game over.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.209
Not so fast.

01:13:01.374 --> 01:13:03.494
Tripp and I have run into you.

01:13:04.098 --> 01:13:09.130
We knew that when the lights would go out,
that the offender would go to night vision.

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:19.389
You can kill all of us, right?

01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:21.521
No.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:30.027
Every one million U.S. dollars.
Undetectable.

01:13:32.732 --> 01:13:34.707
All.

01:13:38.184 --> 01:13:40.348
Two million.

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.563
Put the weapon down.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.308
Put it down and we talk.

01:13:47.607 --> 01:13:49.926
Damn.

01:14:03.323 --> 01:14:06.164
And then there were about six.

01:14:23.368 --> 01:14:26.030
Thank you, guest.

01:14:26.835 --> 01:14:30.434
That solves it in me.

01:14:36.382 --> 01:14:40.081
Take 't. It is insured.

01:14:46.456 --> 01:14:49.609
Blessed new appointment.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:57.084
Thank you, Badger.
I say one more thing:

01:14:57.085 --> 01:15:00.509
From now on, Jelly and I do not
more criminals.

01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:04.680
That's right.

01:15:07.265 --> 01:15:10.030
I almost forgot my ear.

01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:20.115
And ultimately, Peanut Butter
Jelly and with the money going to run?

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:25.130
Crazy, huh?
They went to Winnipeg or something.

01:15:25.462 --> 01:15:28.048
Thank you.
You may go.

01:15:28.049 --> 01:15:31.899
Close everything.
- Your medication, sir.

01:15:32.132 --> 01:15:34.526
I take everything.

01:15:36.329 --> 01:15:37.996
I would the word 'hero' is not used.

01:15:37.997 --> 01:15:43.318
I led my team of hostages
through the darkest time of their lives? Yes.

01:15:43.319 --> 01:15:44.828
I want two months paid time off.

01:15:44.829 --> 01:15:47.279
I want to wear jeans five days a week.
Not just on Fridays.

01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:49.998
And I want lenses in both eyes.

01:15:50.702 --> 01:15:53.635
That you must not do.
- No problem.

01:15:53.636 --> 01:15:55.529
Thank you.

01:16:02.936 --> 01:16:04.867
Please, ma'am.

01:16:04.868 --> 01:16:07.291
Congratulations.

01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:09.383
Thanks again, officer.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:14.537
What is this? A toaster?

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.573
A controlled boat?

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.162
Some people like to get money.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.951
I thought you were never true story.

01:16:25.947 --> 01:16:28.427
Then I remembered that
Weinstein said he ...

01:16:28.547 --> 01:16:30.626
two bank robberies
Tonight was shot ...

01:16:30.726 --> 01:16:34.072
and then I realized that
are basically three robberies.

01:16:34.119 --> 01:16:35.856
A pretty good plan.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:39.238
Kaitlin Nest?
She married the wrong guy.

01:16:38.239 --> 01:16:41.617
What a touching story.
You fake fiance, Max ...

01:16:41.653 --> 01:16:43.474
explains your expensive taste.

01:16:43.473 --> 01:16:47.513
It explains your exotic travel
and your exorbitant demands.

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:51.169
And you have your wedding gifts
walk outside with heaps of money ...

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.165
no one asks questions.

01:16:53.129 --> 01:16:56.370
You did you make a move about seven hours
when the security went out ...

01:16:56.371 --> 01:17:00.734
but Derrien, Drum and everything else
ruined your plan.

01:17:00.735 --> 01:17:02.563
But you waited for it right now.

01:17:02.564 --> 01:17:05.290
And when I turned off the lights,
You did your move.

01:17:19.348 --> 01:17:22.697
Take 't. It is insured.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.149
It's really brilliant.

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:30.233
Nobody goes to the wedding present
of a woman opening ...

01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:35.274
and the policemen carry the
still in the trunk of your car.

01:17:36.481 --> 01:17:38.962
I honestly love you.

01:17:39.603 --> 01:17:41.964
Is that too early?

01:17:41.965 --> 01:17:44.674
What do you want?
- I want to join.

01:17:44.968 --> 01:17:48.673
Is that so?
- Equal partners. No violence.

01:17:48.674 --> 01:17:51.930
Why should I not murder?
- You are not murderous.

01:17:52.029 --> 01:17:53.985
I feel like me.
- You think?

01:17:53.986 --> 01:17:57.008
Yes, it's fun.
We are a great team.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.835
What do you think?

01:18:02.086 --> 01:18:04.986
Are you going to freak out?
- What do you mean?

01:18:05.563 --> 01:18:09.681
The last time I kissed you,
You freaked out. That was pretty sad.

01:18:18.446 --> 01:18:21.891
What is your real name?
- Alexis Black, No. 3 in banks.

01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:24.984
That's so ...fuckin hot!
