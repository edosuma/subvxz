00:12.221 --> 00:14.223
I got some great fireworks for tonight!

00:14.306 --> 00:16.975
Bought them from a guy
whose jaw was just a flap of skin,

00:17.059 --> 00:18.310
so you know they're good.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.269
That's nice.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.438
"Finger Blasters," "Castrators."

00:21.688 --> 00:25.067
Oh! Oh! This one here
is called "The Shaking Dog."

00:25.150 --> 00:27.402
I don't think any of those
should be on your lap.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.487
Good point.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.198
I'm really going all out this year, Sue.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.992
I'm gonna make Chet's
first Fourth of July block party special.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.579
Listen, about Chet.

00:38.163 --> 00:41.124
I know he's your friend
and he's helping us with the baby's room,

00:41.208 --> 00:45.587
but... he may not be
the guy you think he is.

00:45.671 --> 00:48.215
-He's better?
-Jesus Christ, Frank.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.134
Why not drive him up to Make-out Mountain
and queer off with each other?

00:51.218 --> 00:54.137
Ah, damn it, Sue.
What the hell's gotten into you?

00:54.221 --> 00:55.556
[sighs]

00:55.639 --> 00:59.142
The other night, I overheard him
yelling at Nguyen-Nguyen

00:59.226 --> 01:01.019
and treating her like she was his slave.

01:01.103 --> 01:04.273
Oh, my God, Sue... that is terrible.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.817
You snooped on Chet?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.652
No, I didn't snoop on Chet!

01:08.735 --> 01:10.195
[sighs]

01:10.279 --> 01:12.114
I was returning their casserole dish

01:12.197 --> 01:14.908
and he was saying
all these horrible things to her.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.868
Oh, come on, Sue.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.912
He was probably just
letting off some steam.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.330
You know how many times
the cops would be called

01:20.414 --> 01:22.499
if somebody heard the shit
that comes out of my mouth?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.501
Christ, the state would've taken
the kids away years ago.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.669
We're not that lucky.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.046
You're lucky your head's
not through that fucking wall!

01:28.130 --> 01:30.215
And get a haircut!
You look like a lesbian!

01:31.091 --> 01:33.719
See? People say horrible stuff.
Doesn't mean anything.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.554
Frank, I'm serious.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.514
Nguyen-Nguyen sounded
really scared of him.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.850
Honey, we don't know the whole story.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.602
And I don't want to ruin a friendship

01:41.685 --> 01:44.605
and the party we've been
looking forward to all summer over it.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.106
[sighs]

01:46.189 --> 01:47.065
Fine.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.695
For the sake of the block party,
I'll keep my opinions to myself.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.113
There you go!

01:53.363 --> 01:55.157
It's none of our business.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.284
I mean, you wouldn't like it
if someone stared in our window,

01:57.367 --> 01:59.119
listening to our personal conversations.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.288
[chuckles] He's got you there, Sue.

and hot dogs, of course.

so he stinks like he's 42.

and gets in line.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.715

and he just runs the fuck out of there!

-It's all about the push-out doors!

Yes. Using Forkoontula as ice pick.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.030
If ice not dead before, it dead now.

your casserole dish the other night

08:13.994 --> 08:15.495
and, uh...

08:15.578 --> 08:18.540
I heard some of the awful things
that Chet said to you.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.126
Oh, that's just Chet.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.795
He yells, but the next day he real nice.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.380
Chet has a lot of stress.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.507
War keep him up at night.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.469
He has headaches, stomach problems,
sometimes he yell at toaster.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.972
Sometimes he say toaster yell back.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.348
I can handle it.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.766
But he treats you like dirt.

08:36.850 --> 08:41.438
You're not in Vietnam anymore.
This is America.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.939
Greatest country on Earth.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.568
I'm sorry to bust up
your little tea party, ladies,

08:46.651 --> 08:49.279
but do you mind if I borrow
my lovely wife for a bit?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.781
Not at all. She's not my property.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.408
Nope. She's mine.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.493
And I got the marriage license
to prove it.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.828
God damn it, Sue.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.873
Dumpling, I'm dying
for some of your<i> cao lau.</i>

09:00.790 --> 09:02.167
Can you whip me up a batch?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.126
Okay.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.671
Huh, I thought cooking
was the man's job on the Fourth.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.381
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing! [chuckles]

09:08.465 --> 09:10.759
She didn't mean anything.
She says things.

09:10.842 --> 09:11.885
Right, Sue?

09:12.802 --> 09:15.221
Yeah. Must be the heat.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.515
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.934
Fourth of July is all about America,

09:20.018 --> 09:22.937
but I wanted Nguyen-Nguyen
to feel included too.

09:23.021 --> 09:26.775
So, I encouraged her to make a meal
that reminds her of who she is,

09:26.858 --> 09:29.736
the village she came from,
the family she lost,

09:29.819 --> 09:32.822
and the homeland
she so desperately misses.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.200
But if you feel I'm being insensitive,

09:35.283 --> 09:37.911
well, then I guess
you know my wife better than me.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.624
So... I am truly sorry.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.714
-Okay. I give up.
-All right!

10:09.818 --> 10:14.322

All right, fellas, pregnant lady up.

22:10.371 --> 22:11.330
Move in.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.249
Move in at your own risk.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.668
Okay, okay.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.965
What's the matter, hot dog?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.592
You afraid of a girl hitting
your best stuff?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.594
Sue, I thought this was a friendly game.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.012
I'm a big girl.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.306
Come on, meat, bring the heat!

22:29.849 --> 22:32.434
All right... you asked for it.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.528
[crack]

22:44.738 --> 22:46.824
Oh, Christ, now I got to move.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.617
-Home run!
-[all cheering]

22:48.701 --> 22:50.411
-Oh! Nice hit, Sue.
-[women] Whoo-hoo!

22:50.953 --> 22:51.954
Off a great pitch!

22:52.037 --> 22:54.915
Sue, you hit that ball to Saigon!

22:54.999 --> 22:57.001
Nguyen-Nguyen, I'm pregnant, run for me.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.085
Oh, no, I couldn't.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.421
Run for me! Run like the wind,
Nguyen-Nguyen!

23:00.504 --> 23:01.547
Okay!

23:01.964 --> 23:03.465
Go, Nguyen-Nguyen.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.800
[cheering]

23:04.884 --> 23:06.051
[Marie] Attagirl.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.554
Whoo! Enjoy it, Nguyen-Nguyen!

23:08.637 --> 23:12.474
Oh, hey, Chet, how's it feel to have
a bomb dropped on you?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.936
Well, then... I guess we have a game.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.398
[slurring] Maybe I'll hit a homer now!

23:19.481 --> 23:22.568
[all] Girl power! Girl power! Girl--

23:22.651 --> 23:24.320
-Ahh!
-[all gasp]

23:24.403 --> 23:25.446
[groans]

23:25.529 --> 23:27.573
-My God!
-What the hell was that?

23:27.656 --> 23:29.909
-Part of the game.
-You did that on purpose.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.077
She was crowding the plate on purpose.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.996
Thought you wanted to compete
with the big boys.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.498
I knew this was a bad idea.
Get her on her feet.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.875
Rub some dirt on it!

23:37.958 --> 23:39.585
It's my eye!

23:39.668 --> 23:41.629
Are you all right, Mrs. Throater?

23:41.712 --> 23:44.882
Why won't anybody fuck me?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.717
You hit her in the face!

23:46.800 --> 23:48.552
I'm sorry, Sue. I'm confused.

23:48.636 --> 23:49.678
Which one is it?

23:49.762 --> 23:53.057
You want to have a nice, friendly game
with some cucumber sandwiches,

23:53.140 --> 23:55.559
and you broads start halfway to first,

23:55.643 --> 23:58.479
and we let you get there
and kind of build you up and giggle,

23:58.562 --> 24:00.022
or do you want people competing?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.649
Because I'm good either way, Sue.

24:01.732 --> 24:02.983
You piece of shit!

24:03.067 --> 24:04.652
All right, all right, he apologized.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.779
No, he didn't! He's acting like a goon!

24:06.862 --> 24:09.865
Well, you were showboating around
like a smacked-ass Cuban!

24:09.949 --> 24:11.909
Will everyone stop ruining my day?

24:12.576 --> 24:15.788
I just wanted to eat a couple of burgers
and shoot off some fireworks.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.998
God for-fucking-bid that happens!

24:18.082 --> 24:19.792
Jesus Christ, I got you yelling at him.

24:19.875 --> 24:20.918
You're throwing at her.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.544
And Ginny, get the fuck up!

24:22.628 --> 24:24.880
You got hit by a pitch, not a car! Okay?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.757
Your husband went gay. We're all sorry!

24:26.840 --> 24:28.217
No one saw it coming.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.970
Now I got seven more beers to drink
before the grand finale.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.055
So, both of you, knock it off.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.808
No more showboating, no more beanballs.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.893
And Ginny, take your fucking base!

24:37.977 --> 24:39.228
I can't believe you, Frank.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.648
You spent the whole day
making excuses for him

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
and then when he throws the ball
at my friend,

24:44.650 --> 24:46.235
you can't even stand up to him?

24:46.318 --> 24:49.071
I told him not to hit anymore women
in the face with the ball.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.156
Jesus, what are you on their team now?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.700
I'm not on anybody's team!

24:52.783 --> 24:54.410
You sure as hell aren't on mine!

24:54.493 --> 24:57.371
What the hell happened to Air Force
taking care of their own, Frank?

24:57.454 --> 24:59.915
Come on, Chet, you're better than this.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.959
Oh, so I'm the bad guy.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.210
Yes!

25:03.293 --> 25:05.421
-Nobody's the bad guy. It's just that--
-I get it.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.631
Nice game, teammate.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.093
Maybe we should take her to a doctor.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.302
Take Frank with you.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.097
Ask them to reattach his balls.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.182
Come on, Dumpling, we're going home.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.643
Yes, Mr. Chet.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.813
Oh, come on, Chet. Don't leave like that.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.567
-Sue--
-Thanks for the support, asshole.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.333
[fireworks bursting]

25:57.347 --> 25:59.224
I'm sad too.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.770
Since my brother
done did become a rock star,

26:02.853 --> 26:05.647
he got too big for his britches

26:05.731 --> 26:07.441
and, well, I don't wear none.

26:07.983 --> 26:08.984
Tough break, kid.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.782
Are you gonna eat this here
cocktail wiener, huh?

26:15.324 --> 26:17.076
That's not for eating, little fella.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.786
You light it with this.

26:25.959 --> 26:26.919
[explosion]

26:27.002 --> 26:28.253
[Ken groans]

26:28.337 --> 26:31.632
Can somebody call the people mechanic?

26:31.715 --> 26:33.759
[snoring]

26:33.842 --> 26:35.469
[birds chirping]

26:40.224 --> 26:43.268
Oh, my goodness. What time is it?

26:45.646 --> 26:49.274
Mary, you would've been
so proud of me yesterday.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.401
I had so much fun,

26:51.652 --> 26:55.239
but a little too much Patriot Punch.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.366
Oh, it's all a blur.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.244
What good Samaritan brought me home?

27:00.327 --> 27:02.246
Well, hey, silver fox.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.873
Ready for another porch pound?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.792
Oh, fuck me.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.545
[speaks German]

27:09.628 --> 27:11.171
[Otto]<i> Oh, very well.</i>

27:11.255 --> 27:13.465
[Ginny]<i> Oh, lookie, lookie!</i>

27:13.549 --> 27:15.592
-[Otto]<i> Yeah, okay.</i>
-[Ginny kissing]

27:15.676 --> 27:16.969
[Ginny]<i> Ooh!</i>

27:17.052 --> 27:21.598
[Otto]<i> That is not so good.</i>
<i>Agh! Agh!</i> [speaks German]

27:21.682 --> 27:23.725
[Ginny]
<i>Okay, who's gonna turn over? Me or you?</i>

27:23.809 --> 27:26.979
-[Otto]<i> Just think happy thoughts.</i>
-[Ginny]<i> Oh, there we go.</i>

27:27.729 --> 27:30.566
-[Ginny]<i> Mwah, mwah, mwah!</i>
-[Otto speaks German]

27:30.649 --> 27:32.943
[Otto]<i> Oh, what is-- What is that?</i>

27:33.485 --> 27:35.445
<i>Are those hot quarters?</i>

27:35.529 --> 27:37.990
-[Ginny]<i> Oh! Surprise!</i>
-[Otto]<i> Ah! Oh!</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:42.119
-[mechanical whirring]
-[gunshot]
