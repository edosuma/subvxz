"One Wild Moment"
<i>The sea,</i>

00:48.708 --> 00:50.707
<i>See her dancing</i>

00:51.417 --> 00:54.374
<i>Along the bright gulfs</i>

00:56.333 --> 00:58.957
<i>Reflections of silver</i>

00:59.125 --> 01:00.999
<i>The sea</i>

01:01.917 --> 01:03.999
<i>Reflections shimmer</i>

01:04.167 --> 01:07.499
<i>In the rain</i>

01:08.625 --> 01:10.124
<i>The sea</i>

01:11.875 --> 01:13.249
<i>In the summer sky</i>

01:14.167 --> 01:17.082
<i>Her white sheep fly</i>

01:19.375 --> 01:21.916
<i>With angels so pure</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:24.207
<i>The sea</i>

01:24.792 --> 01:26.832
<i>Azure shepherdess</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:29.291
<i>Infinite</i>

01:31.292 --> 01:33.332
<i>See</i>

01:34.583 --> 01:36.499
<i>Near the ponds</i>

01:37.083 --> 01:39.582
<i>Those tall wet reeds</i>

01:42.750 --> 01:45.082
<i>See</i>

01:45.625 --> 01:47.916
<i>Those white birds</i>

01:48.083 --> 01:51.332
<i>And those rusted houses</i>

01:53.917 --> 01:55.666
<i>The sea</i>

01:57.208 --> 01:59.291
<i>Has calmed them all</i>

01:59.458 --> 02:02.499
<i>Along the bright gulfs</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:08.457
<i>And with a love song, the sea</i>

02:10.042 --> 02:12.249
<i>Has calmed my heart</i>

02:12.417 --> 02:15.249
<i>For all my life</i>

02:16.083 --> 02:18.582
<i>The sea</i>

02:19.708 --> 02:21.666
<i>See her dancing</i>

02:22.458 --> 02:24.582
<i>Along the bright gulfs</i>

02:27.917 --> 02:29.249
Ooh la la la…

02:29.750 --> 02:32.332
What have they built…?
- Yeah.

02:32.916 --> 02:34.556
At least there were independent thinkers.

02:34.667 --> 02:38.416
Otherwise, we’d have buildings and hotels
like that everywhere on the coast.

02:38.583 --> 02:39.583
You knew them?

02:39.750 --> 02:41.707
Yeah, I knew them all.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.166
- Oh yeah?
- Sure.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.707
- Dad?
- What?

02:56.875 --> 02:58.749
- Is it far?
- No.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.749
When I was small,
I rode my bike

03:03.917 --> 03:05.499
on this road every day to go to school.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.332
It took my father five years
to let me have a bike.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.916
Five years!

03:11.083 --> 03:14.016
Oh man! That day...
It was heaven.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.166
I was proud!

03:16.333 --> 03:18.291
I rode into the village,

03:18.458 --> 03:20.332
I rode up, I biked around,

03:20.500 --> 03:22.207
I rode back down.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.916
I rode back up,
I biked around the whole village again.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.124
Hey! Look.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.457
Oh, ok.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.874
- Take the suitcases, we’re here.
- This is it?

04:02.167 --> 04:04.041
Dad, will you take my suitcase?

04:04.208 --> 04:05.249
Keep dreaming.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.707
You're really not cool.
- Thanks.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.249
Not cool.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.541
You must've had a beautiful childhood.

04:17.708 --> 04:19.957
You know, childhood,
it depends on the parents.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.624
It's really far from the sea.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.374
It's far from everything.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.996
Now that makes me feel something.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.957
- We’re going up?
- Yeah.

05:03.708 --> 05:06.874
Well, at least it's in
its original condition.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.999
I cleaned when
I came with the lawyer.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.582
The old man lived in two rooms.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.207
Kitchen, bedroom, kitchen.
Like a rat.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.332
Ah! Look at this! Look!

05:19.500 --> 05:22.249
- That, that is priceless!
- Wow!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.207
I swear...

05:24.375 --> 05:26.207
When you're in Paris,
you can't understand.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.582
You're right.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.874
I think the boar's head is bad.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.499
I’m not staying here.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.666
There's no network. Great!

05:37.836 --> 05:40.166
Stop being stereotypes of your generation!

05:40.333 --> 05:41.582
Ugh, fine.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.749
Admit it, having that on the wall...

05:43.917 --> 05:45.291
It's a little...

05:46.750 --> 05:47.791
What?

05:47.958 --> 05:50.082
How do you say “bad" normally?

05:50.542 --> 05:52.166
In French? It's “creepy”.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.333
It creeps you out?

05:53.458 --> 05:54.874
Me, no.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.446
On the other hand, that, behind you...

05:57.458 --> 05:59.832
That creeps me out.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.041
I love guns.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.276
Truly her father’s daughter.

06:02.292 --> 06:04.749
A real Corsican. You see that?

06:04.917 --> 06:06.666
My father gave it to me when I was 14.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.666
- How do you load the bullets?
- Like that. Cartridges.

06:10.833 --> 06:11.916
What are you doing?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.749
Teaching her how to use it?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.500
Am I scaring you?

06:16.250 --> 06:17.250
Hey.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.999
One more floor.

06:25.167 --> 06:28.416
And look at this dust. Disgusting.

06:28.583 --> 06:29.957
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.707
You could die of heat, too.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.541
This is it, I guess.

06:41.292 --> 06:43.541
Oh, charming.

06:44.958 --> 06:46.666
Anguish...

06:46.833 --> 06:47.999
Nice digs.

06:51.625 --> 06:52.999
- What?
- Come see!

06:53.167 --> 06:54.957
- What?
- There's a rat in the room.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.374
I’m not sleeping here.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.957
- I'm sick of this already.
- He’s dead!

06:59.125 --> 07:02.666
So what? It's still a rat.
That means they’re everywhere.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.249
Disgusting!

07:07.417 --> 07:09.624
Here. Ok, fine.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.582
We’ll buy poison and eradicate the colony.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.499
Really?
You can’t kill Ratatouille.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.541
You kidding me?

07:15.708 --> 07:18.124
Why wouldn't I do such a thing?

07:18.958 --> 07:20.457
Beware!

07:21.708 --> 07:23.707
- Dinner's ready!
- You're an idiot!

08:15.208 --> 08:16.249
You find a network?

08:16.417 --> 08:17.832
"Network unavailable."

08:18.000 --> 08:20.166
This makes me sick.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.791
Damn.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.207
There’s no network...

08:24.375 --> 08:26.416
No wifi, no TV.
We’re going to die.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.624
You’re always in a bad mood!

08:28.792 --> 08:29.916
It's incredible.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.332
Look out the window!
Look at the beautiful weather!

08:33.500 --> 08:35.166
There’s the sea, the Corsicans,

08:35.332 --> 08:36.749
wild boars running in the forest…

08:36.917 --> 08:38.957
Sausages flying!

08:39.125 --> 08:40.816
Come on, damn it!

08:45.042 --> 08:47.999
Let's go! 2, 3, 4...

08:48.250 --> 08:49.582
Hey!

08:49.792 --> 08:53.576
Come on, yeah, yeah!

09:02.167 --> 09:03.416
Good...

09:03.875 --> 09:05.957
I called your mother, she’s not picking up.

09:06.216 --> 09:07.696
You have signal?

09:07.708 --> 09:09.416
Yes, on your grandfather’s grave.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.041
Oh, cool!

09:12.792 --> 09:14.624
There’s a grave in the garden?

09:14.917 --> 09:16.499
Sure, the whole family.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.332
No, sorry, Antoine, but...

09:21.333 --> 09:23.916
it's just that between
the rat and the grave,

09:24.083 --> 09:25.283
it's the height of creepiness.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.124
- Stop.

09:26.292 --> 09:28.707
You'd prefer we were in the cemetery?

09:28.875 --> 09:31.791
- I respect my elders.
- You don’t respect your father.

09:33.667 --> 09:36.416
I don’t like him. That doesn’t
prevent me from respecting him.

09:47.042 --> 09:50.332
Me, I think it's grim.
These are your ancestors.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.832
They’re not going to be resurrected.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.707
Aren’t you afraid of bad luck?

09:54.875 --> 09:57.416
It’s the only place where there’s signal.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.624
- The connection’s working?
- Yeah, I’m on Facebook.

10:01.792 --> 10:02.957
- Wait, really?
- Look.

10:03.125 --> 10:06.541
Come on, we need to take a
zombie photo on the grave!

10:07.542 --> 10:09.291
Hold on, I'll find Ratatouille.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.874
Shut your mouth!

10:11.042 --> 10:13.041
- Wait, come on...
- Hold on.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.707
Is it good?

10:18.266 --> 10:21.066
- Awesome.
- Go on, did you post it?

10:21.083 --> 10:22.624
There, done.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.082
- Damn, girl!
- What?

10:24.250 --> 10:26.050
- Romain is in Corsica!
- I don’t believe you.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.082
- Look.
- He set his status to "single"!

10:28.250 --> 10:30.124
I'm going to send him a message.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.166
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.499
- Hey, alcoholic.
- Hey.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.416
Dad...

10:38.583 --> 10:40.249
Can we go out tonight?

10:40.417 --> 10:42.166
With whom and where?

10:42.333 --> 10:44.249
- With some friends.
- Friends?

10:44.417 --> 10:46.266
- I thought you didn’t know anyone.

10:46.426 --> 10:49.291
I saw on Facebook that
some people are around.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.374
- They can pick us up.
- On Facebook?

10:52.542 --> 10:54.249
- Who?
- Our friends.

10:54.417 --> 10:55.499
How are they getting here?

10:55.866 --> 10:56.666
On scooters.

10:56.708 --> 10:57.791
Oh no, no.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.041
Yeah, no.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.416
- Not on a scooter.
- I'm in agreement.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.332
Fuck, Dad! We’re big girls!

11:03.500 --> 11:04.541
Again, without “fuck.”

11:04.708 --> 11:07.249
Ok? You're too
young to die on scooters.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.957
It’s a quick death.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.541
What time are you coming back?

11:11.708 --> 11:13.207
You tell us.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.166
Midnight?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.124
Seriously?

11:16.292 --> 11:17.499
- Midnight.
- Midnight?

11:17.667 --> 11:19.082
We’re not babies anymore.

11:19.583 --> 11:20.916
1:30 am at the latest.

11:20.926 --> 11:22.586
And I’m calling you a
cab to bring you back.

11:22.596 --> 11:25.874
Stop being stupid.
What do you say?

11:26.042 --> 11:27.042
Thank you, Daddy.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.374
- Good.
- Daddy... totally.

11:29.542 --> 11:31.666
- Thank you, Daddy.
- No, I’m not Daddy.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.582
Yeah, he's Papi.

11:34.083 --> 11:37.082
Marion, it's me.
There’s no network at the house,

11:37.250 --> 11:39.374
so it's a bit complicated to contact you.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.707
Leave a text if you get this message.
Texting works...

11:43.333 --> 11:45.707
Sometimes... Listen...

11:46.625 --> 11:48.499
Well, I'll call you.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.541
Louna's in fine form.

11:50.708 --> 11:53.041
Sorry I got upset, but...

11:53.208 --> 11:54.832
Well, it was silly.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.791
It's just the first time we haven’t
spent our holiday together.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.291
- Someone there?

11:59.458 --> 12:01.332
Ok. We miss you.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.749
I miss you.
Talk to you later, I hope.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.374
Hey, Antoine!

12:07.542 --> 12:08.624
Oh!

12:11.375 --> 12:12.874
Hi!

12:13.042 --> 12:14.582
Antoine, remember me?

12:14.750 --> 12:16.124
Of course I remember you.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.541
You think?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.207
- Who's that?
- The neighbor, I think.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.457
You came back a little later…
compared to your father.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.916
It wasn’t easy.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.749
You remember when we went

12:31.917 --> 12:33.416
hunting with your father?

12:33.583 --> 12:35.707
- I remember.
- I took you on my shoulders.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.832
You were always embarrassed
about your little nuts on my neck!

12:42.583 --> 12:45.207
- That’s your daughter?
- The brunette, yes. That's Louna.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.374
Hello.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.036
Beautiful as she is, she must turn heads.

12:49.106 --> 12:51.416
No way! What are you talking about?

12:51.466 --> 12:52.716
She’s still a baby.

12:52.816 --> 12:54.874
They used to be married by that age.

12:55.186 --> 12:56.396
And there, that’s Marie.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.041
- Her friend.
- Hello.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.916
She’s the daughter of my friend Laurent.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.666
Hello, how are you?

13:02.083 --> 13:03.832
You don’t have a wife to sweep?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
- Yes, yes.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.999
- Mine is coming tomorrow.
- Really?

13:09.583 --> 13:11.791
And your wife, how is she doing?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.166
She's dead, you know.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.976
Two weeks after your father.
I thought I would see you at the funeral.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.124
- You know, work, work…
- Yes, work…

13:24.292 --> 13:25.374
What's his name?

13:25.542 --> 13:26.582
Loukoum. [Turkish Delight]

13:28.083 --> 13:29.541
But yes.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.249
My companion called him that.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.624
I found a young woman.
A Maghrebine.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.582
They’re good, the Maghrebines.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.124
They’re sweet.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.624
- And they make good couscous.
- Ah yes.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.374
But that's not all...

13:42.542 --> 13:44.374
Loukoum, come!

13:45.125 --> 13:46.582
Let's go.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.207
- Hey.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.707
He’s mega-racist, no?

13:52.208 --> 13:53.256
Why?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.124
You see how he said "Maghrebine”?

13:55.292 --> 13:57.499
Maghrebine, that just means

13:57.667 --> 13:59.016
“A person from the Maghreb."

13:59.083 --> 14:02.624
And isn't that just the bourgeois way,
to not call a spade a spade?

14:02.792 --> 14:04.291
It's alright, Dad, relax.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.582
- What happened? He's so serious.

14:06.750 --> 14:10.332
Admit it, it's crazy!
Two days ago, they were a couple!

14:10.500 --> 14:14.457
But how can you go out
with Romain? He's a kid!

14:14.625 --> 14:15.957
He's older than you!

14:16.125 --> 14:17.624
Not mentally.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.749
- I'm sorry, but Romain is smart.
- Smart?

14:20.917 --> 14:24.124
The guy spends his life stoned
in front of his PlayStation.

14:24.292 --> 14:25.749
There are better guys.

14:25.917 --> 14:28.499
- Fine, like who?
- I dunno.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.791
A guy you can talk to,

14:30.958 --> 14:33.332
who can teach you things.
That’s sexy.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.832
Funny, friendly, intelligent.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.124
- Who cares, I didn’t say I was
spending my life with him.

14:39.292 --> 14:42.082
Why not? That would be my dream.

14:42.625 --> 14:44.707
Seriously. Meet a guy,

14:44.875 --> 14:48.041
now, and love each other till the end.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.832
- Stop!

14:52.000 --> 14:55.374
I don’t believe it! Welcome
to Louna’s Care Bears world!

14:55.583 --> 14:57.707
"I’d like to meet my guy,"

14:57.875 --> 14:59.874
"and stay with him till the end..."

15:06.375 --> 15:08.791
Stop! Ouch!

15:08.958 --> 15:10.666
Bring them back at 1:30.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.207
Ok, I'll be there...

15:12.375 --> 15:14.416
But I'm not going to look
for them in the club.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.332
They’re not going to go clubbing.
Right, girls, no clubbing?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.791
No, no clubbing.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.006
You’re not going clubbing.

15:21.066 --> 15:22.559
No, we're going to the
beach with some friends.

15:22.583 --> 15:25.143
Ange will be there, you call me
if there’s the slightest problem.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.568
There won’t be any problems, Dad..

15:27.625 --> 15:29.957
Then we agree, 1:30 am at the latest.

15:30.125 --> 15:31.207
- Ok, see you.

15:32.596 --> 15:34.416
And if you don’t come back on time,

15:34.583 --> 15:35.707
know what’ll happen?

15:35.875 --> 15:36.875
What?

15:39.906 --> 15:41.666
- Go!
- Kisses.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.156
- Have fun.

15:50.042 --> 15:52.686
They’re annoying, but they’re cute.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.374
True, we're lucky.

16:07.708 --> 16:10.166
He’s really too cool, your dad.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.333
Yours, on the other hand…

16:11.417 --> 16:14.541
sucks. This is the first time
I've had to change in the car.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.778
She vowed to her mother she would
tell her when it happens.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.315
And her mother is going to tell you?

16:21.458 --> 16:24.291
- She's my wife.
- You're dreaming!

16:24.458 --> 16:27.666
You don't understand. Mothers
and daughters, they're like that.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.416
You, as a man, you will always remain

16:29.583 --> 16:31.146
a strange animal, an alien.

16:31.186 --> 16:33.566
A marked man who absolutely
can't be trusted.

16:33.596 --> 16:35.832
You talk to her about sex?

16:36.375 --> 16:37.666
- Yes.
- Yes?

16:37.833 --> 16:41.041
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't go into detail.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.041
I explained things,
I gave her advice.

16:44.208 --> 16:47.356
- Can you see me, talking
about contraception, pills...

16:48.250 --> 16:51.006
- It's not contraception
you have to talk about.

16:51.083 --> 16:54.666
You should talk to her about
condoms, danger, diseases.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.374
About protection.

16:56.542 --> 16:59.196
It's our role as fathers
to protect our daughters.

16:59.636 --> 17:01.541
I'm not comfortable with that.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.707
What do you want me to do?
Buy her condoms?

17:07.083 --> 17:08.332
Why not?

17:08.500 --> 17:10.374
First, because...

17:10.541 --> 17:13.707
I don't know, it's women who
have to take care of themselves.

17:13.875 --> 17:17.165
And what are we even talking about?
Louna is a baby.

17:17.816 --> 17:19.082
She's a baby.

17:29.667 --> 17:32.956
Two! Three!

17:40.292 --> 17:42.374
Ah! It's disgusting!

17:45.125 --> 17:46.707
Take it! Take it!

17:46.875 --> 17:47.957
It's us!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.166
- Take it!
- It's us!

17:51.333 --> 17:52.749
What's the matter?

17:54.042 --> 17:55.541
Fuck off!

17:59.708 --> 18:00.957
Stop!

18:05.667 --> 18:07.582
Do you regret getting divorced?

18:08.917 --> 18:10.791
Yeah, of course I regret it.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.416
Not least of all for Marie.

18:15.333 --> 18:19.166
You know, it's always the same
ones who suffer. The kids.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.291
Oof!

18:23.458 --> 18:26.124
However, Marie doesn't seem so bad.

18:26.292 --> 18:29.082
No, but not so good.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.291
There's always some damage.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.207
And then for me,

18:34.375 --> 18:37.832
for years, you build
something with someone,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.791
to end up alone like an idiot.
It's sad.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.291
You'll find someone.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.124
I'm not sure that I miss it.

18:48.292 --> 18:49.832
That's what you think.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.791
That's what you miss the most.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.582
Yeah?

18:55.167 --> 18:56.916
I have that impression.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.416
Here, look.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.291
- Hold this for me.
- What?

19:02.458 --> 19:04.041
- Wait.
- I'm not your slave.

19:04.208 --> 19:05.832
- Wait. Louna!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.457
- Marie.
- What?

19:07.625 --> 19:09.041
Come on, take a picture.

19:09.208 --> 19:10.499
Wait, you take the photo.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.374
- Take our picture.
- It works.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.166
How does this thing work?

19:15.333 --> 19:16.582
But in three seconds!

19:16.750 --> 19:19.624
- Video!
- No, photo, that's good.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.957
- Like that.
- You are wonderful.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.874
You know what,
I love your pink panties.

19:25.042 --> 19:27.041
They're not pink, they're red.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.750
Show us a tit.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.957
- Fuck off.
- Stick out your tongue.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.499
- Do we look dead or not?
- That's perfect.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.791
Marie, if you're dead,
can I make love to you?

19:35.958 --> 19:37.916
Fuck you!

19:38.083 --> 19:40.457
Go fuck your buddy,
I'll take your picture.

19:44.042 --> 19:46.457
- Hey, we saw her ass!
- Yes, bravo!

19:46.625 --> 19:48.749
- Bravo, bravo, I love it!

19:49.016 --> 19:50.426
- What are they doing?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.916
- Relax!
- Have you seen the time?

19:53.083 --> 19:54.707
Relax...

19:54.875 --> 19:56.457
I don't like being betrayed.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.291
You're exaggerating a bit.
She didn't betray you.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.624
Here.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.999
Wait, wait, wait.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.124
On scooters?

20:13.292 --> 20:15.332
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.416
- See you tomorrow.
- Ciao!

20:19.966 --> 20:22.466
Shh! Shh!

20:26.750 --> 20:28.332
How's it going?
Are we bothering you?

20:28.500 --> 20:31.082
By scooter!
Didn't we talk about that?

20:31.250 --> 20:33.332
- No scooter!
- And without a helmet!

20:33.500 --> 20:35.332
Didn't I tell you a hundred times?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.624
Oh, Dad...

20:36.792 --> 20:38.749
And what is this outfit?

20:38.917 --> 20:41.166
Well, uh...

20:41.333 --> 20:43.041
And you're drunk?

20:43.208 --> 20:44.916
- No!
- We're not drunk.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.916
- Yes, yes!
- No.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.582
I'm not drunk, look.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.707
- I've got you.
- That's enough.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.791
That's enough.

20:55.958 --> 20:58.541
- Hold on...
- Oh!

20:58.708 --> 21:00.457
Off to your room.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.416
It's complicated here,
there are pebbles everywhere.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.374
Tomorrow I'm canceling canyoning!

21:22.708 --> 21:25.499
We're arriving at Lovers' Falls.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.166
We'll go two by two.
Who's next?

21:29.333 --> 21:31.541
- Go ahead.
- Go.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.541
Louna, you're going with me.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.541
Dad, it's Lovers' Falls.

21:35.708 --> 21:36.791
You don't love your father?

21:36.958 --> 21:38.332
Yes, but...

21:38.667 --> 21:40.874
You're my father, you know?
- It's beautiful!

21:41.042 --> 21:42.957
- Seriously!
- Come on, Louna.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.666
Are you ready? Let's go.

21:45.708 --> 21:46.999
Come on, Louna.

21:47.716 --> 21:50.666
That's perfect, good positioning.
Push off with your legs.

21:51.716 --> 21:53.541
That's perfect.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.041
- Everything's alright.
- It's ok, it's ok.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.874
Look carefully where you step.

22:01.042 --> 22:02.957
- Something detached.
- Trust the equipment.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.291
- I don't trust it.
- It's fine, it's fine.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.416
Wtach out, it's a little slippery.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.791
- It's slippery...
- Ok, ok.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.916
- Are you still behind me?
- I'm here.

22:15.076 --> 22:17.291
No, calm down. Calm down.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.541
Calm down, calm down.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.457
I'm here, look. Look at me.
Look me in the eyes.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.457
It's fine. Ok?

22:25.625 --> 22:27.457
We'll continue slowly.

22:27.516 --> 22:28.999
- Slowly.
- Let's go.

22:29.167 --> 22:32.291
I'm here, relax. Are you ok?
- No!

22:35.917 --> 22:37.832
- You feeling good?
- Yeah.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.416
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.332
Not me.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.916
- Are you holding me?
- Don't worry.

22:44.083 --> 22:46.249
One more effort... Ok.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.666
Ok, we're good!

22:59.292 --> 23:00.749
Ah, damn!

23:08.566 --> 23:11.026
You were magnificent.
I'm very impressed.

23:19.542 --> 23:22.874
So, for you, making a point means
spending the holidays separately?

23:23.042 --> 23:24.749
- That's about it. Well, yes.

23:24.917 --> 23:27.166
- I mean, in the dictionary,
"Making a point"

23:27.333 --> 23:29.499
- is not defined as:
"Spending holidays separately."

23:30.667 --> 23:33.791
- No, but I'm asking you...

23:33.958 --> 23:36.207
- And what's this Ibiza business?

23:36.375 --> 23:38.416
- What's this Ibiza business?

23:39.750 --> 23:42.832
- So you had already planned
to leave with your girlfriend.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.541
- You're taking vacations
behind my back, you know.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.666
- And I'm alone, dealing with
Louna at my father's house,

23:49.833 --> 23:51.624
- thank you very much.

23:51.792 --> 23:53.124
What's up?

23:56.042 --> 23:58.791
- You chose the right moment.
There's no doubt.

24:02.958 --> 24:05.416
- What, I'm exaggerating?
Are you there or aren't you?

24:05.583 --> 24:07.666
- Well then, I'm not exaggerating.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.874
I'm not yelling, I'm explaining!

25:15.542 --> 25:18.832
Come on, Dad, tonight is
when there's a full moon.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.582
You didn't have to go out last night,
like a "fuck you" to us.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.416
Coming back completely smashed
and dressed like a...

25:25.583 --> 25:26.791
I'm begging you!

25:26.958 --> 25:29.916
We're not leaving for three days.
Don't do this to me.

25:30.083 --> 25:32.874
The best DJs on the beach
are there, DJ Snake...

25:33.042 --> 25:36.332
- and there will be 2,000 people.
- That's not reassuring.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.374
Marie's right. It sucks.

25:38.542 --> 25:39.582
- Laurent.
- Yes?

25:39.750 --> 25:41.624
Marie's going out?

25:41.792 --> 25:44.791
- Look at her, she's legal.
- There you go. You, no.

25:44.958 --> 25:46.624
In eight months I'll be legal!

25:46.792 --> 25:49.041
In eight months, there will
still be full moons.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.166
You disagree?

25:53.226 --> 25:54.856
Not really, but it's not a big deal.

25:54.866 --> 25:56.624
I have to play the bad guy.

25:56.792 --> 25:58.791
Wait... who's over there?

25:59.417 --> 26:02.291
Is that the chick that
you liked on the boat?

26:03.333 --> 26:06.616
- She's cute.
- Yeah, definitely cute.

26:06.646 --> 26:07.916
Louna!

26:08.083 --> 26:09.624
- What?
- Come here.

26:10.566 --> 26:12.596
If Laurent accompanies you, I'm ok with it.

26:12.667 --> 26:13.291
Really?

26:13.458 --> 26:14.966
Yeah.

26:15.666 --> 26:17.096
Thanks, Dad!

26:17.886 --> 26:19.846
Thank you too...

26:20.566 --> 26:22.966
- Are you serious?
- Why?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.874
I don't care about DJ Snake!

26:25.042 --> 26:27.541
We can't leave them alone on
the beach, or on scooters.

26:28.833 --> 26:30.541
We at least have to control that.
- Ok.

26:31.083 --> 26:33.374
Take my car.
I'll manage.

26:33.542 --> 26:36.426
You aren't playing the victim anymore!
Are you kidding me?

26:36.500 --> 26:38.766
What a hypocrite!
I don't believe it.

26:41.542 --> 26:43.249
- Too cool.
- Seriously.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.624
Oh, no...

26:59.766 --> 27:00.816
We're leaving, this sucks.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.374
Can you give me 20 euros,
please, Dad?

27:07.167 --> 27:09.666
This is for both of you.
Don't get drunk.

27:09.833 --> 27:11.374
We couldn't do much with that.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.416
- Check-in is in one hour.
- One hour?

27:14.583 --> 27:16.041
I didn't say we were leaving.

27:16.208 --> 27:19.291
I want to make sure
you're not drunk.

27:19.458 --> 27:20.957
Ok.

27:21.656 --> 27:28.832
Come on.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.582
You have to stop following me,

27:32.750 --> 27:34.957
or else I'll call the police.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.249
It's you who's following me.

27:37.566 --> 27:38.716
What do you mean?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.666
It's been 10 minutes since
I saw you turn around.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.416
That's because I was thinking...

27:44.583 --> 27:47.416
I hesitated between jam, chocolate...

27:50.083 --> 27:51.207
You're greedy.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.582
Oh yes.

28:20.167 --> 28:23.416
Why's it always the sexy men
who don't want to talk?

28:24.583 --> 28:27.166
I thought, "I'll finish my drink
and then I'll feel her up."

28:30.250 --> 28:32.541
Can I have two gin
and tonics, please?

28:32.708 --> 28:34.041
Thank you.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.791
Did you come alone?

28:35.958 --> 28:37.582
No, I came accompanied.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.541
By my daughter.
I'm on guard tonight.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.707
How much do you charge?

28:44.458 --> 28:45.999
Why, are you interested?

28:46.667 --> 28:48.066
Yes.

29:12.542 --> 29:16.291
I didn't understand

29:36.666 --> 29:38.416
Good evening.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.249
I ordered you a cup.

29:41.417 --> 29:42.832
I gotta talk to you.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.582
Not now, I love the music.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.457
It's your dad, I swear!

29:46.625 --> 29:48.749
- Huh, my dad?
- He scored a chick.

29:50.208 --> 29:51.332
Who cares?

29:51.416 --> 29:53.616
You have to cover for me,
I'm going to Romain's tonight.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.249
She's old, she's...

29:56.417 --> 29:59.541
old and ugly and she looks annoying.

29:59.833 --> 30:01.416
What the fuck is it to you?

30:02.042 --> 30:03.042
Bitch!

30:05.056 --> 30:06.186
Fuck off!

30:18.208 --> 30:19.582
Please, can we leave?

30:20.208 --> 30:21.582
- Huh?
- Come on, let's leave.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.124
We just got here.

30:23.292 --> 30:25.207
- They got me drunk!
- Huh?

30:25.375 --> 30:27.707
Please, they got
me drunk. My friends.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.499
Come on! Fuck!

30:29.667 --> 30:31.832
- Where's Marie?
- Marie's drunk too.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.249
Come on! Let's go, please!
Let's go, Laurent!

30:36.417 --> 30:39.124
I can't go back, I'm drunk.

30:39.292 --> 30:41.416
Let's go, please. Come on.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.916
Let's go, let's go. Please, Laurent!

30:46.083 --> 30:47.582
- Come on!
- Go find Marie.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.416
Good, I'm going.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.416
I thought,
as we kiss,

30:53.583 --> 30:55.166
Why not right away?

30:55.333 --> 30:58.541
Yes! Right away, let's go!

30:58.708 --> 31:00.791
- You're sure of yourself.
- Well, yeah.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.416
You too, incidentally.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.832
I don't know you well enough.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.791
What do you mean?

31:09.958 --> 31:13.207
I don't know, maybe you're married.
You wear a wedding ring.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.957
Yes, well...

31:17.958 --> 31:20.541
My wife and I, right now,
things are cold.

31:20.708 --> 31:22.124
All married guys say that.

31:22.292 --> 31:23.457
For me, it's true.

31:23.625 --> 31:27.291
Would you want your wife to be
in a cafe kissing someone else?

31:29.083 --> 31:31.041
She wouldn't do that, my wife.

31:31.583 --> 31:34.207
You think your women aren't like you.

31:34.917 --> 31:36.707
I know my wife.

31:38.417 --> 31:40.249
They're good, your women.

31:40.417 --> 31:43.999
Wisely waiting at home,
while you dredge

31:44.167 --> 31:45.916
the cafe terrace.

32:06.167 --> 32:08.166
Dad, can I leave...

32:13.583 --> 32:14.999
I can't drive.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.082
We're taking a taxi,
and I won't come home late.

32:18.250 --> 32:20.036
Please, please, please!

32:21.375 --> 32:22.791
You're going too?

32:22.958 --> 32:24.791
I can't leave you alone in this state.

32:27.292 --> 32:30.056
- Go ahead, I trust you.
- Yes, thank you!

32:39.208 --> 32:40.416
Buy me a drink?

32:41.917 --> 32:43.916
- A drink?
- Well, yeah.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.066
Hey!

32:54.333 --> 32:56.582
Sorry, I didn't see that you called.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.291
Where are you?

32:58.458 --> 33:01.249
Huh? What are you
doing in a bar?

33:02.500 --> 33:05.999
No, but anyway...
I doubt you're alone.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.249
Who are you with?

33:07.417 --> 33:10.499
Who are these new friends I don't know?

33:10.667 --> 33:11.999
No, I'm not spying on you.

33:12.167 --> 33:14.624
But when <i>you</i> ask,
I answer you.

33:15.292 --> 33:16.582
Fine, I'll tell you.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.874
I brought the girls
to eat a crepe.

33:19.042 --> 33:21.374
I'm taking care of Louna
while you're at the bar.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.166
Well, when are you coming?

33:23.625 --> 33:24.832
I said, "When are you coming?"

33:25.917 --> 33:28.416
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you anymore!

34:28.792 --> 34:29.956
Damn, what is...?

34:30.125 --> 34:31.998
That's your wall.
It's the boars.

34:32.167 --> 34:33.541
Damn it!

34:33.708 --> 34:36.248
- Look. It's the wild boars.
- Damn it!

34:36.417 --> 34:39.748
Fucking critters! Damn it!
- Your wall...

34:39.917 --> 34:43.041
- I don't believe it, my wall!
- How many were there?

34:48.167 --> 34:49.623
Oh, damn!

34:50.275 --> 34:52.306
Come on, let's go swimming!

34:52.375 --> 34:55.016
No, I'm drunk,
I'll sink to the bottom.

34:55.292 --> 34:56.498
Ooh...

34:58.266 --> 35:01.276
I'm not sober, but
it feels good to dance.

35:01.446 --> 35:04.332
- Seriously!
- Really, it feels good.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.457
Yeah. You coming?

35:07.250 --> 35:08.957
- No, no.
- Let's go!

35:09.125 --> 35:10.166
Come on!

35:10.333 --> 35:12.416
No, I'm telling you, it's cold.

35:14.208 --> 35:16.249
Don't act old,
you're not credible.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.874
But I am old!

35:17.986 --> 35:19.296
No!

35:19.667 --> 35:22.249
What are you doing? Stop.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.617
If we don't do it with the full
moon, when will we ever?

35:25.750 --> 35:27.999
- No, no.
- Come on!

35:30.417 --> 35:32.332
Hey, I'll do a little dance for you?

35:32.500 --> 35:34.999
- But I don't want...
- Just for you.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.374
Hey, hey!

35:41.356 --> 35:42.916
Stop!

35:44.556 --> 35:45.874
Don't look at me like that.

35:46.042 --> 35:47.207
What?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.832
Come on, move your ass!

35:50.667 --> 35:51.707
No, stop.

35:51.875 --> 35:52.875
Am I annoying you?

35:53.042 --> 35:54.457
It's not that, but...

35:54.625 --> 35:55.625
Hurry up!

35:55.708 --> 35:57.916
What are you doing,
Louna? Stop!

35:59.746 --> 36:01.516
Stop.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.483
- Let's go.
- No, really, I can't...

36:09.000 --> 36:11.624
It'll do you good!
It'll sober you up!

36:11.792 --> 36:14.332
Come on! Come on!

36:14.500 --> 36:17.332
Come on, Laurent!
Don't leave me alone.

36:18.958 --> 36:21.832
- No, honestly, there are jellyfish.
- Laurent!

36:22.000 --> 36:23.499
We only have one life!

36:23.667 --> 36:25.332
One life!

36:25.500 --> 36:27.916
Are you shy?
What's your problem?

36:28.176 --> 36:29.176
Laurent!

36:29.333 --> 36:31.249
Laurent, Laurent!

36:33.083 --> 36:35.957
- Come on, don't leave me alone!
- Ok!

36:39.426 --> 36:41.356
- Attention!
Laurent is undressing.

36:41.426 --> 36:44.386
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

36:45.716 --> 36:47.706
- Laurent is removing his pants!

36:49.826 --> 36:52.066
- Laurent is undressing!

36:52.208 --> 36:54.207
What's with that underwear?
"Where's Waldo?"

36:55.586 --> 36:57.166
Stop! Marie gave them to me.

36:57.333 --> 36:58.874
Oh, the shame!

37:00.906 --> 37:03.666
You're going to swim in your boxers?

37:03.708 --> 37:06.666
You think I'm going to strip
naked in front of you?

37:06.833 --> 37:09.041
It's all good, who cares?

37:09.208 --> 37:10.749
Look at me!

37:18.125 --> 37:20.041
But take off your boxers!

37:20.208 --> 37:22.366
It's good, it's good.

37:22.833 --> 37:25.082
Hey! Stop, stop!

37:25.250 --> 37:27.076
Stop!

37:28.458 --> 37:29.999
Are you crazy, or what?

37:30.167 --> 37:31.374
Stop, stop!

37:45.708 --> 37:48.416
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- I'm cold.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.041
Fuck.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.416
You can't do that, Louna.

38:33.958 --> 38:35.846
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.457
I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?

38:37.958 --> 38:40.041
No, it's not that I'm mad at you, but...

38:40.208 --> 38:42.874
I can't... It's not you.

38:45.042 --> 38:49.776
Between Mom calling me and saying
not to tell Dad... my head's all fucked up.

38:52.542 --> 38:54.582
- I don't know where I am.
- No, hold on.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.582
- My head's fucked up.
- I know, I know.

38:58.750 --> 39:01.041
I didn't pick up on it immediately.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.426
I should have
put myself in your place.

39:03.583 --> 39:07.416
You surprised me, you know?
I was really surprised.

39:07.583 --> 39:08.583
It's ok.

39:09.708 --> 39:13.749
I can talk to you, you listen to me.
You don't judge me.

39:13.917 --> 39:16.041
No, I'm not judging you.
It's not that.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.166
But...
Put yourself in my place, you know?

39:21.625 --> 39:23.207
Yeah, I know.

39:24.208 --> 39:27.707
When I'm with you,
I feel like nothing can happen to me.

39:29.292 --> 39:32.166
I feel good. Don't you?

39:32.333 --> 39:34.624
Yes, yes, I feel good.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.582
I'm fucking cold.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.166
Oh, damn...

39:40.333 --> 39:41.874
Come on.

39:42.417 --> 39:43.999
It's ok.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.082
Ok, let's go.

39:50.356 --> 39:51.457
Louna, stop.

39:51.625 --> 39:52.999
Hold on...

39:53.916 --> 39:56.116
Stop. No, no, no.

39:56.458 --> 39:59.124
- Louna, stop.
- Just let it happen.

39:59.292 --> 40:00.874
Please, stop.

40:01.542 --> 40:04.457
Louna, please, stop.
Please, stop.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.916
Louna, what are you doing? Stop.

40:25.708 --> 40:27.416
Stop...

40:45.750 --> 40:48.791
- You know, this is the first time.
- For what?

40:49.458 --> 40:51.791
Well, the first time that...

40:53.833 --> 40:55.041
I've been in love.

40:59.083 --> 41:01.874
- Louna...
- I love when you speak my name.

41:10.292 --> 41:13.791
<i>The words that we say with our eyes</i>

41:13.958 --> 41:17.249
<i>Talking seems ridiculous to me</i>

41:17.417 --> 41:20.416
<i>I jump forward and then step back</i>

41:20.583 --> 41:23.791
<i>In front of a useless sentence</i>

41:23.958 --> 41:27.166
<i>Which would break the fragile moment</i>

41:27.583 --> 41:33.249
<i>Of an encounter</i>

41:34.708 --> 41:37.999
<i>I'll tell her the blue words</i>

41:38.167 --> 41:41.786
<i>The ones that make people happy</i>

42:11.216 --> 42:12.356
The motherfuckers!

42:12.375 --> 42:13.866
What are you doing with that gun?

42:13.886 --> 42:17.166
These motherfucking boars are
trying to eat the garden and

42:17.333 --> 42:19.791
my father's grave!
- That's creepy!

42:20.792 --> 42:21.916
Yes, it's creepy.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.167
Where's Marie?

42:24.500 --> 42:25.791
Marie went with...

42:25.958 --> 42:27.957
- She went with...
- She went to a club,

42:28.125 --> 42:29.916
with friends of hers.
- With her friends.

42:30.083 --> 42:32.999
You let things go completely to
hell when I'm not there!

42:33.542 --> 42:34.542
Why do you say that?

42:34.625 --> 42:36.082
Because you're too kind!

42:37.708 --> 42:39.966
- Stop!
- Definitely too nice.

42:40.576 --> 42:42.096
Well, good night, hunter.

42:45.606 --> 42:46.606
Bisou.

42:46.796 --> 42:47.796
Good night.

42:47.875 --> 42:48.916
Good night.

42:57.626 --> 42:58.626
So?

42:59.250 --> 43:01.216
- What?
- At the party!

43:02.000 --> 43:03.124
At the party?

43:03.292 --> 43:05.707
- How was it?
- The party, it sucked, lame.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.707
Lame, really...

43:07.917 --> 43:09.624
Me too, very lame.

43:15.666 --> 43:17.101
You coming?
What you hell are you doing?

43:17.125 --> 43:18.316
I'm coming.

43:48.583 --> 43:50.207
Hello!

43:50.375 --> 43:52.332
- Stop!
- What?

43:53.500 --> 43:54.707
Louna, last night...

43:55.417 --> 43:57.832
It was monumentally stupid.
Really.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.874
- Really.
- When did this start?

44:00.042 --> 44:02.249
No, Louna. Listen to me...

44:20.542 --> 44:21.957
Hello.

44:36.856 --> 44:38.136
They're nice, your pajamas.

44:40.756 --> 44:42.176
Did you get Mom?
Is she coming?

44:42.417 --> 44:44.016
Yes, yesterday.

44:44.125 --> 44:45.874
She won't be long.

44:48.958 --> 44:50.136
Hello.

45:01.276 --> 45:03.207
I love Corsica, Dad.

45:03.833 --> 45:07.374
This air, this sky... The sun!

45:07.542 --> 45:09.249
That makes me happy.

45:14.375 --> 45:17.666
- Not bad, right? Among family?
- Yeah.

45:27.333 --> 45:29.166
Well, what is it?

45:30.458 --> 45:32.457
It didn't go well with Romain?

45:33.042 --> 45:34.291
Yeah, it was cool.

45:35.417 --> 45:38.082
So, tell me! You slept with him?

45:40.125 --> 45:41.125
None of your business.

45:42.333 --> 45:43.874
Are you ignoring me?

45:44.292 --> 45:45.666
Why?

45:46.833 --> 45:48.041
Do I have a reason to?

45:48.208 --> 45:50.332
No, that's why.
I don't understand.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.041
There are also things
that I don't understand.

45:55.958 --> 45:57.207
Yeah?

45:59.042 --> 46:00.374
Like what?

46:02.667 --> 46:05.457
What are you doing with my dad's boxers?

46:06.167 --> 46:07.249
Oh, they're your dad's?

46:09.417 --> 46:11.457
I found them in your stuff.

46:13.292 --> 46:14.916
That must be it.

46:22.708 --> 46:24.499
So, you have 30 volts.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.791
It'll shake him a little. Otherwise,

46:27.958 --> 46:29.041
we have the same in 220.

46:29.208 --> 46:31.207
This, to warn you, will burn the boar.

46:31.792 --> 46:33.749
But at least you'll have peace and quiet.

46:34.958 --> 46:35.958
220.

46:36.167 --> 46:38.749
Hold on.
It may not kill them?

46:38.917 --> 46:40.957
Kill them, no,
but it'll smoke them.

46:41.125 --> 46:42.707
They won't come back.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.582
No, no.

46:45.458 --> 46:46.458
220, right?

46:46.583 --> 46:48.806
No, frankly, I think it's

46:48.816 --> 46:50.101
a bad idea to have that in the garden.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.999
There are children, animals...

46:52.167 --> 46:54.791
- The neighbor's dog...
- They won't fuck with me anymore.

46:54.958 --> 46:56.957
Wild boars are like women.

46:57.125 --> 46:57.749
Eh?

46:57.958 --> 47:00.249
With a full moon, they go crazy.

47:00.417 --> 47:01.749
I don't see the connection.

47:01.917 --> 47:04.506
When the moon comes out,
worms emerge from the ground.

47:04.708 --> 47:07.332
And the boars trash everything
to eat them.

47:08.208 --> 47:09.249
Just like women.

47:09.542 --> 47:10.624
Yes...

47:10.792 --> 47:11.999
It is true that women...

47:16.417 --> 47:18.166
220. Come on.

47:18.333 --> 47:21.332
Loads of little asses!
If I weren't married...

47:21.500 --> 47:23.832
- It didn't stop you last night.
- I didn't do anything.

47:24.667 --> 47:26.999
What? She didn't want it?

47:27.167 --> 47:28.999
Hey, look.

47:29.167 --> 47:31.332
There, the black two-piece.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.749
- Ah yes.
- Oh, wow.

47:34.792 --> 47:37.457
Oh, that ass! That ass!

47:37.625 --> 47:39.916
Oh la la.

47:40.206 --> 47:42.016
It's a festival.

47:42.083 --> 47:43.957
Where are these
chicks in the winter?

47:44.125 --> 47:46.332
They work. They're
in an office in Seville.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.999
In Paris, you don't see them.

47:48.167 --> 47:49.957
Here we are.

47:53.986 --> 47:54.986
So?

47:56.208 --> 47:57.208
So what?

47:57.333 --> 47:58.499
So, the boars?

47:58.667 --> 48:02.124
220. It'll grill them
like a barbecue.

48:02.292 --> 48:04.457
My father is a psychopath.

48:04.625 --> 48:06.707
Will you rub lotion on me?
I can't reach.

48:07.125 --> 48:08.832
Who, me?
Ask your father.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.999
Oh no, I'm reading.

48:12.583 --> 48:13.749
Here.

48:14.667 --> 48:17.249
- Come on!
- A lounge chair with an

48:17.417 --> 48:18.666
integrated umbrella!

48:18.833 --> 48:20.916
For the beach, it's brilliant.

48:21.376 --> 48:22.716
I'm going to buy it.

48:23.458 --> 48:25.416
Blue, green, or red.

48:26.875 --> 48:28.791
It's awesome.

48:33.792 --> 48:34.916
A zen chair.

48:36.466 --> 48:38.656
Red, blue, green.
There's no yellow.

48:42.446 --> 48:45.291
Where's Marie? It's been a
while since I've seen her.

48:45.366 --> 48:46.516
I don't know, over there.

48:46.542 --> 48:47.542
Where?

48:47.708 --> 48:48.832
I don't have GPS.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.874
Isn't that her talking
to that little asshole?

48:55.625 --> 48:57.791
Who's that person?
What's the deal?

48:57.958 --> 49:00.707
I'm not responsible
for others' actions.

49:02.417 --> 49:03.957
He's much older than her.

49:04.833 --> 49:06.374
It's alright, he's only...

49:06.542 --> 49:07.791
He's at least 20!

49:07.958 --> 49:09.416
You realize he's old!

49:11.542 --> 49:14.166
Ok.
I'm going for a dip.

49:15.042 --> 49:16.166
What did I say?

49:17.208 --> 49:19.166
Wait for me, I'm coming with you.

49:28.083 --> 49:29.707
Can't I swim alone?

49:35.417 --> 49:36.874
I like swimming alone.

49:37.042 --> 49:41.832
Hey, remember, it was in the same
ocean that we kissed the first time.

49:42.375 --> 49:44.249
Yes, but hey!

49:44.417 --> 49:48.957
This isn't a movie, it's reality, you
understand? Go back to the beach.

49:49.125 --> 49:50.999
Wait, wait!

49:51.708 --> 49:52.708
What?

49:53.625 --> 49:54.999
I'm peeing.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.957
- Marie!
- Huh?

50:04.016 --> 50:05.316
- I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.

50:05.333 --> 50:08.406
I said we can have an afterparty at
the house and have some drinks.

50:10.167 --> 50:11.666
Piss off!

50:15.292 --> 50:17.166
A collapsible wheelbarrow.

50:17.333 --> 50:19.374
This is great.
I'm going to buy it.

50:19.833 --> 50:21.957
You don't have anything else to look at?
- Why?

50:22.958 --> 50:26.207
You're right, your catalog
is the most important.

50:27.750 --> 50:31.541
Listen, Louna.
Yesterday evening wasn't anything

50:31.708 --> 50:33.707
- Nothing happened.
- What?

50:34.458 --> 50:37.016
Your father is my best friend.
And you're a minor.

50:37.083 --> 50:38.457
You understand that?

50:38.625 --> 50:40.832
Yes, but we're in love.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.291
No, we're not in love.
I don't love you.

50:44.458 --> 50:48.291
It's normal that you don't accept it.
I saw it in your eyes yesterday.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.541
Louna, fuck!

50:56.375 --> 50:58.249
It's not true, honestly!

51:03.500 --> 51:05.666
Making a point,
I can understand.

51:05.833 --> 51:09.207
With effort, but I understand.
Ibiza, I don't understand.

51:09.375 --> 51:12.374
I don't care if you love dancing.

51:12.542 --> 51:15.416
Yes, and you're with that bitch
who could never stand me.

51:15.583 --> 51:17.624
Yes. Well, listen to me carefully.

51:17.792 --> 51:19.624
Tomorrow, 7:40 pm. Figari.

51:19.792 --> 51:22.041
There's a plane.
I'll pick you up.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.957
She hung up.

51:27.917 --> 51:31.541
Damn... but, Lolo.
Am I right or am I wrong?

51:35.125 --> 51:36.874
Listen...

51:39.083 --> 51:40.874
Ibiza, it stinks.

51:41.542 --> 51:44.249
I love that bitch
I don't know what to do anymore.

51:55.042 --> 51:57.957
Listen, Antoine.
I wanted to tell you...

51:58.750 --> 52:00.166
That I...

52:01.125 --> 52:02.666
You really are my friend.

52:12.196 --> 52:14.416
Where do you think you're going, like this?

52:14.458 --> 52:15.749
What's it to you?

52:15.917 --> 52:18.499
Calm down and take it down a notch.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.874
You think you can go out every night?

52:21.042 --> 52:23.166
I don't think so. I'm sure of it.

52:23.542 --> 52:26.416
No. Louna isn't going out.
Antoine isn't going out.

52:26.583 --> 52:28.416
I'm not going out, and neither are you.

52:28.516 --> 52:30.906
You don't need to.
You have everything at home.

52:32.042 --> 52:34.291
What's that supposed to mean?

52:34.458 --> 52:35.749
By the way...

52:35.816 --> 52:37.426
If you're looking for your boxers,

52:37.458 --> 52:40.516
the ones I gave you
for Father's Day,

52:40.583 --> 52:42.207
they're in my room.

52:43.792 --> 52:45.832
I'm going. Good night, Dad.

52:53.375 --> 52:55.041
You're letting her go out again?

52:55.583 --> 52:57.207
She didn't come home late.

52:57.750 --> 52:59.716
You're not even going out in your dreams.

52:59.792 --> 53:01.286
I'm good here.

53:34.667 --> 53:36.832
- What are you doing here?
- I want to sleep with you.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.957
No, go back to your room. Go!

53:39.125 --> 53:40.291
Dad!

53:40.458 --> 53:42.291
Shh! Please, stop.

53:44.250 --> 53:47.332
Shh, shh! Stop.

53:48.333 --> 53:52.041
Shh! You can stay,
but don't touch me.

53:52.208 --> 53:54.416
You promise?

53:54.583 --> 53:57.374
- Hey! Promise.
- Ok.

54:05.417 --> 54:07.326
Stop.

54:37.417 --> 54:38.916
Hey!

54:39.083 --> 54:41.041
- What?
- Get up, Marie's coming.

54:41.208 --> 54:43.356
- Marie's coming.
- It was so nice.

54:44.083 --> 54:45.457
So nice?
I didn't touch you.

54:45.625 --> 54:48.186
To sleep together.
That's what it's like to be a couple.

54:49.833 --> 54:51.986
We're not a couple.
Get to your room.

54:52.156 --> 54:53.916
But I'm in my room.

54:53.966 --> 54:57.276
No, you're in <i>my</i> room.
Now go to <i>your</i> room.

54:58.042 --> 55:00.124
We have to announce our
love to the family.

55:00.958 --> 55:03.176
But... I don't love you.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.136
That's not how it felt on the beach.

55:09.708 --> 55:11.216
I beg you, please...

55:11.333 --> 55:13.624
Go to your room!

55:13.746 --> 55:16.106
If you don't tell me you love me,
I'm not leaving.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.316
She's opening the door...

55:23.006 --> 55:24.336
She's coming up the stairs...

55:24.500 --> 55:26.707
Stop, stop. I love you.

55:27.167 --> 55:28.167
What?

55:28.208 --> 55:29.624
I love you, I love you.

55:29.792 --> 55:31.374
- You're sure?
- Yes.

55:31.542 --> 55:33.499
- Say it again.
- I love you.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.707
I love you, ok.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.791
I love you too.

55:39.417 --> 55:41.124
Go!

55:42.750 --> 55:44.536
Fuck...

56:14.396 --> 56:15.696
I need to talk to you.

56:15.716 --> 56:17.116
I'm tired.

56:18.417 --> 56:19.906
I really need to talk to you.

56:19.958 --> 56:21.666
I don't want to listen.

56:26.958 --> 56:29.457
- It's about your dad.
- Shut up!

56:29.625 --> 56:31.166
I'm in love with him.

56:31.333 --> 56:32.333
Whore!

56:32.458 --> 56:34.791
What don't you understand
about "shut up"?

56:34.958 --> 56:36.124
Let me explain.

56:36.292 --> 56:37.582
Explain what?

56:37.750 --> 56:40.666
You're a slut and he's a pervert.
I'm aware.

56:42.056 --> 56:43.266
But we're in love!

56:43.292 --> 56:45.041
Shut up!

56:45.208 --> 56:48.266
Do you understand or not? Shut up!

57:41.566 --> 57:43.016
Why are you doing this?

57:43.542 --> 57:45.541
Because I love you.

58:17.083 --> 58:18.124
Fuck's sake.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.374
Damn, what
are you doing here?

58:22.208 --> 58:23.707
I'm sleeping. Can't you see?

58:25.083 --> 58:26.707
Why aren't you
in your bedroom?

58:26.875 --> 58:29.166
Why are you asking so many questions?

58:46.750 --> 58:49.296
This isn't possible,
this isn't possible at all!

58:49.333 --> 58:50.466
What? What?

58:50.736 --> 58:51.796
What?

58:52.116 --> 58:53.906
Your daughter is speaking
disrespectfully to me.

58:53.917 --> 58:56.582
When I say disrespectful,
she talks to me like a dog.

58:56.666 --> 58:58.806
She talked to you about
what sort of things...

58:58.875 --> 59:00.749
No sort of things!
She's disrespectful to me!

59:00.816 --> 59:02.486
There are two solutions:
You set her straight

59:02.500 --> 59:04.457
or I do,
but it won't be the same.

59:04.625 --> 59:05.749
No, no, no!

59:05.917 --> 59:08.541
I'll take care of it.
It's true she's difficult.

59:08.708 --> 59:10.291
I think she's on her period.

59:10.416 --> 59:13.957
No. If Louna was talking to you like that,
I'd put her in her place.

59:14.125 --> 59:15.499
- You understand?
- Yes, yes.

59:15.667 --> 59:18.291
Give me two minutes
to find the right time.

59:18.458 --> 59:21.124
The best time is now.

59:21.292 --> 59:22.896
Now.

59:43.542 --> 59:44.624
You want eggs?

59:48.542 --> 59:50.541
What's with Marie?
Any idea?

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:18.999
Has Mom called you?

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.582
I can't tell you that.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.332
Oh, Louna!

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:27.791
Yes, but I don't have to tell you.

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.041
What did she say to you?

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.999
Nothing.
She talked a little about your stuff.

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:34.916
What stuff?

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.916
About your separation, finally...

01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:41.516
That's new. We're not separated!
We're on a break!

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.866
A break during the holidays?

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.096
She talked to you about the separation?

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:47.458
I dunno.

01:00:47.516 --> 01:00:50.636
She's looking at neighborhoods
to put me in a good high school.

01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:54.416
What's this school bullshit?

01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:59.707
She thought, after...
I have no idea.

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:01.582
She's planning to move?

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.582
It's your business,
don't take me hostage over it!

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:18.124
Am I dreaming?
How can you do this to me?

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:22.124
Still, what's this business?

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:24.999
- It's not true!
- Yeah, Dad.

01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:26.016
I won't lie to you.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:28.499
What's this collusion
between you two?

01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.207
I'm in the middle.

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:34.291
I'm not against you, it's a
relationship that has always.

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:37.716
Listen, I'm sorry...

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:39.666
Listen to me carefully.

01:01:39.708 --> 01:01:40.916
You know what she told me?

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:42.083
Antoine, listen.

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:44.332
Marion wants to move.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.624
That's super...

01:01:51.566 --> 01:01:52.906
Are you stupid or something?

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:54.207
No, that's super...

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:55.749
It's super serious.

01:01:55.917 --> 01:01:57.066
Of course it's serious!

01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:59.116
Why does she want to move?

01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:02.166
I'm going to punch something
if she doesn't answer this time.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.791
That's all you told him?

01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:13.207
There are other things,
but it's better if you do it.

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:24.041
- This is 100 euros an hour?
- Oh, no!

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.208
Half hour.

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.249
You think I'm a <i>pinzutu?</i>

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:29.291
Come on, please, Dad!

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.500
Yes!

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.749
Your mother wouldn't do that.

01:02:35.917 --> 01:02:37.416
Thanks, Dad.

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:40.541
- We don't take cards.
- Fine.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.249
I know the type.

01:02:45.167 --> 01:02:47.832
Thank you.
The girl has a boating permit?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Nope.

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:50.457
- And do you have one?
- Nope.

01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:52.249
No permit, no jet-ski.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.416
- That sucks!
- That's how it is.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:57.791
Lolo!

01:02:57.958 --> 01:02:59.332
Yeah?

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.500
You have a permit.

01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:02.291
- Yes.
- Don't you want to take her?

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:06.041
Well, no, I wanted to paddle alone.

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:08.316
You know the full moon, Dad,

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:09.916
when I was with Laurent...

01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.666
At the same time, if the sea

01:03:13.676 --> 01:03:16.041
is beautiful, it's the time to jet-ski.

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:17.249
I'll take you.

01:03:17.566 --> 01:03:19.366
You can thank Lolo.

01:03:19.417 --> 01:03:20.832
Thanks, Lolo.

01:03:29.917 --> 01:03:31.082
Thank you.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:36.466
The killswitch is there,
you accelerate...

01:03:36.542 --> 01:03:37.999
Alright, we know.

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.957
I knew I need a permit.

01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:00.416
- Did you?
- Well, yeah.

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:03.124
- Hang on. You're going to be scared.
- Why?

01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:11.707
- Doing ok?
- No!

01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:13.374
What's the matter?

01:04:13.542 --> 01:04:15.916
- Stop!
- What? What's wrong?

01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:18.166
- Stop!
- Hey, look!

01:04:18.466 --> 01:04:19.566
Listen!

01:04:19.625 --> 01:04:22.166
What, you want to go back to the beach?

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.499
Stop, stop!

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:25.906
- It's cool, look!
- No, it's not cool!

01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:28.332
- Yeah, it's cool!
- No, not cool!

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.207
But it's so cool!

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.041
Stop! Stop!

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.208
No!

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.832
I'll fall off!

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:46.766
May I?

01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:49.249
You're already there, so yeah.

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:50.457
Hello.

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.666
- Hi, how it's going?
- Hi, good.

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:56.207
Can I talk with you?

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.041
I'll leave you two.

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:02.332
He's really good looking, your boyfriend.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.166
You came to tell me that?

01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:06.874
No, I wanted to talk.

01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:09.624
I can tell something's bothering you.

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:11.291
Very good sense of observation.

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:16.582
If you want to talk to me, or have me
pass on a message to your father,

01:05:16.586 --> 01:05:18.582
I can tell him, ok?

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.291
Tell him he's an asshole.

01:05:21.236 --> 01:05:24.116
What happened?
It is because of your mom?

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:25.832
- Is that it?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.791
Yeah, it's because of Mom.

01:05:31.042 --> 01:05:33.366
Don't worry, things will get better.

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.916
And I'm here.

01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:36.816
You can count on me.

01:05:37.176 --> 01:05:38.596
Ok?

01:05:39.766 --> 01:05:43.416
- Gotcha!
- You're screwing us.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.716
It's up to me, so, take that!

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:53.416
Nice!

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.749
- Come on, play!
- Nice, nice!

01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:58.166
I can link.

01:05:59.083 --> 01:06:00.166
By the way, Dad,

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:02.616
Any news from Amandine?

01:06:04.042 --> 01:06:06.776
It's been a while since
you talked about her.

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:09.816
I liked that girl. Very funny.

01:06:12.966 --> 01:06:14.056
Who is she?

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:15.832
Amandine, naughty girl...

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.166
I'll grab you in the kitchen—
- We're playing!

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:20.374
Whose turn is it?
- Yours!

01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:22.874
Well then, there.

01:06:22.966 --> 01:06:25.066
Why didn't you ask her
to come to Corsica?

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.516
What's your thing
with Amandine?

01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:30.416
I don't know.
It might make you happy.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:32.791
But... alright, fine.

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.207
I'll ask her.

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:41.541
Ah! There's my driver.
I have to go.

01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:43.366
Don't leave

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:44.916
in the middle of the game!

01:06:44.966 --> 01:06:47.466
There are things where
it's better not to know the end.

01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:52.207
Some days, she reminds
me too much of her mother.

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:55.707
Good. Your turn.

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.291
I don't want to play anymore.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.916
Ok, then I'm
going to call Marion.

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:06.041
Seriously?

01:07:12.636 --> 01:07:13.766
Who's this bitch?

01:07:16.042 --> 01:07:17.866
- Who's this whore?
- Calm down.

01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:19.707
And mind your own business.

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.516
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:24.116
You're not my wife either.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:26.874
Are you sure?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.832
What are...

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.041
- I was nice, but it's over.
- You're hurting me!

01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:39.999
No! It didn't mean anything,
and it won't happen again.

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:41.749
It's over! Leave me be.

01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:54.374
It's been a long time
since you gave me a hug.

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.166
I feel miserable, Dad.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.582
Don't worry,
it'll work out with Mom.

01:09:01.292 --> 01:09:03.666
I got her on the phone,
it'll be fine.

01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:04.832
It's not Mom.

01:09:06.582 --> 01:09:07.916
Is it my fault?

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:09.457
No.

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.457
Oh...

01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:13.999
Oh la la la la...

01:09:15.042 --> 01:09:17.374
That's a tragedy, then.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.374
What's happening, baby?

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:21.957
I don't know if I can tell you.

01:09:22.066 --> 01:09:24.816
Of course you can tell me!
You can tell me anything.

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:27.332
You know I often
have good advice.

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:29.124
So...

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.582
What's happening?

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:34.499
Well...

01:09:35.582 --> 01:09:36.624
It's a boy?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:41.207
Yes, or...?

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:42.874
Yes.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:44.999
So, what's happening?

01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:48.582
Nothing's happening. Not anymore.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.082
Then something happened?

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.582
Yes.

01:09:52.457 --> 01:09:54.082
You're in love, is that it?

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:56.249
Very.

01:09:56.417 --> 01:09:58.666
What do you want me to say?

01:09:58.958 --> 01:10:00.666
Love is beautiful.

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.041
But it's nothing serious either.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.332
Yeah?

01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:09.707
It's serious?

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:13.291
But you haven't
done anything serious?

01:10:13.458 --> 01:10:15.866
Why? I told you not to do it

01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:17.582
without talking to me.

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:20.041
What, Dad, you wanted
me to text you?

01:10:20.208 --> 01:10:22.916
Hey! When did it happen?

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.166
- Well, there...
- There when?

01:10:26.333 --> 01:10:27.333
There!

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.500
Where, in Corsica?

01:10:28.667 --> 01:10:29.816
- Yes.
- When?

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:31.416
Here, but... damn!

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:32.832
Tell me. Where and when?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.666
I'm talking about emotions
and you're asking questions.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.866
It's Marie?
One of her friends?

01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:42.957
No, not Marie's group.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:44.750
Who then?

01:10:45.125 --> 01:10:47.266
Who cares?
I'm telling you it's over.

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:50.016
What do you mean?
It just started and

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:52.166
it's already over?
- Yes.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.457
You slept with
a boy who dumped you?

01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:56.816
Who's the bastard?

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:58.624
He's a good guy, I swear.

01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:00.749
Really? A little brat who...

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:05.249
...my daughter, and dumps her?
Yeah, that's a good guy.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:07.457
He's not a brat.

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:08.625
Oh really, then what?

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:11.166
He's a good guy, a little older.

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.707
Even if he's 20,
he's still a little brat.

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.499
He's not twenty.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:16.667
Sorry?

01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:18.457
He's a little older.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.916
Thirty? You realize that

01:11:20.966 --> 01:11:22.832
thirty is almost double...

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.666
Who cares about age!

01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:27.124
No, I do care!
How old is he?

01:11:27.292 --> 01:11:28.707
Who is this old fart?

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:31.249
He was your age
and he's not an old fart.

01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:32.624
Who is this motherfucker?

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.916
- You're bothering me!
You're pissing me off, damn it!

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:40.791
- I want to know who it is.
Tell me exactly who it is!

01:11:40.958 --> 01:11:45.249
- Mom's right to steer clear of you.
You're a pain in the ass!

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:48.916
- You don't care about me!
You only think of yourself. Fuck!

01:11:55.958 --> 01:11:57.041
Not eating?

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.082
You're really pathetic.

01:12:03.316 --> 01:12:04.616
Marie...

01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:16.832
Louna, can I come in?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.166
Leave me alone, I'm tired!

01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:21.116
You're pissing me off! Fuck off!

01:12:28.616 --> 01:12:30.366
Antoine, I have to talk to you.

01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:34.082
Come on, I need
some fresh air.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:36.957
I need to take a walk.

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:46.325
I'll beat the shit out of him.

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:48.249
Don't talk like that.

01:12:48.417 --> 01:12:50.999
Can you imagine? Louna, my baby?

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.749
With a 45-year-old.

01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:55.041
Imagine for two seconds!

01:12:55.916 --> 01:12:56.916
You see...

01:12:57.042 --> 01:12:59.666
You can't imagine. Why?
Because it's unimaginable.

01:13:02.583 --> 01:13:04.374
I'm fuming.

01:13:05.266 --> 01:13:06.566
Did she say who it was?

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:08.624
I'll find him, don't worry.

01:13:08.792 --> 01:13:10.332
Trust me, I'll find him.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.249
If you don't know who it is, it
won't be easy. Corsica's big.

01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:16.416
It's big, but it's also small.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:19.041
- And you'll help me.
- What do you mean?

01:13:19.208 --> 01:13:20.416
You'll help me.

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:22.216
Ok, but what do you want me to do?

01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:23.624
Your daughter needs to know.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.207
Marie? Forget it.

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:27.416
I wouldn't count on Marie.

01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.166
She'll never betray her friend.
I know her.

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:32.249
I'll go see her, don't worry.

01:13:32.417 --> 01:13:34.207
Let's start from the beginning.

01:13:34.375 --> 01:13:36.207
- Maybe—
- You know what?

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:38.041
One night, you go out with Louna.

01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:39.457
- She likes you.
- Oh, no.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:43.366
Yeah, she likes you a lot.
You can pull it out of her.

01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:45.116
Nonchalantly.

01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:47.207
They're little girls,
not strategists.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.499
It'll pay off, believe me.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.207
You do that
in front of everyone?

01:13:53.375 --> 01:13:54.582
I'm alone.

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:55.999
You know what I mean.

01:13:56.167 --> 01:13:57.749
"You know what I mean," he says.

01:13:57.917 --> 01:13:59.791
Hey, want to tone it down a little?

01:13:59.958 --> 01:14:00.999
Or what?

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:02.582
Or you'll see what!

01:14:05.833 --> 01:14:07.082
Really...

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.216
You're happy?
Proud of yourself?

01:14:16.316 --> 01:14:17.366
What's the matter?

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:19.582
Your father instructed me
to find the fucker

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:23.249
who put his hands on you.
- Why didn't you say anything? It would all be settled.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:25.056
What are you talking about?

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.266
You've got no balls.
You're scared of Dad.

01:14:28.596 --> 01:14:30.266
I'm afraid of your father?

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:31.624
Give me my swimsuit.

01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:57.082
I think a sausage
got locked in the car.

01:15:15.125 --> 01:15:16.749
Is it good?

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.624
Yeah.

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:26.582
Everything ok?
Do you like the house?

01:15:29.417 --> 01:15:30.666
It's fine.

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:36.916
- And how do you like Corsica?
- I don't know who it is.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:38.750
Huh?

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:42.207
The guy who you're looking for.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.624
But if you really want to know,
she has a cell phone.

01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:52.957
Only you can do this.

01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:56.291
No! She knows
I'll tell you everything.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:58.124
No, you go out with her one evening...

01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:00.541
If necessary, you take a little booze.

01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:02.832
You earn her trust.
She loves you.

01:16:03.116 --> 01:16:04.466
I'll take care of Marie.

01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:06.874
Marie's already going out tonight.

01:16:06.916 --> 01:16:08.566
Fuck! I don't understand.

01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:13.332
How do you let her
go out every night? Shit.

01:16:14.417 --> 01:16:16.666
Calm down, it's the holidays.
I'm cool.

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:18.266
There's cool and there's <i>cool</i>.

01:16:18.417 --> 01:16:19.624
I'm normal cool.

01:16:24.116 --> 01:16:25.016
Hi.

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:25.916
Hi.

01:16:26.016 --> 01:16:27.216
Hello.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.666
Doing ok? Can you
watch my stuff?

01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:31.374
Of course, baby.

01:16:31.542 --> 01:16:34.016
- We're going to play paddleball.
- Sure, sweetie.

01:16:34.966 --> 01:16:36.166
Thank you.

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:41.291
Done.

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:43.417
Coming?

01:16:57.583 --> 01:17:00.416
What are you doing? Stop.
Don't stoop to that.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:08.166
- Eh, what do I care.
- No, Antoine, don't do it.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.041
- I'm going to fuck that asshole.
- Stop.

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:14.124
- There are photos, messages...
- Stop, stop.

01:17:14.366 --> 01:17:15.566
Shit! There's a code.

01:17:15.616 --> 01:17:17.816
Of course there's a code.

01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:19.666
- That's normal.
- Son of a bitch.

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:20.833
Her birthday.

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:22.832
Or yours,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.082
or her mother's,
or her dog's...

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:26.582
Damn, that's not it!

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.207
Have a little respect.

01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:31.566
Her mother's birthday, you're right.

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:32.791
Enter two wrong codes...

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.124
You'll lock the phone
and burn bridges

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:37.999
with your daughter.
- Shit.

01:17:38.167 --> 01:17:39.416
Damn it...

01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:41.566
Come on, let it go.

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:44.791
Oh, fuck you! What would you
do if it were your daughter?

01:17:44.916 --> 01:17:46.366
I wouldn't be looking in her phone,

01:17:46.417 --> 01:17:48.266
not my ex, not my daughter, not anyone.

01:17:48.375 --> 01:17:49.624
It's not right.

01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:52.332
Holy shit...

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:56.136
Ok, tonight,

01:17:56.167 --> 01:17:57.365
we'll go have a drink,

01:17:57.366 --> 01:17:58.756
and I'll fix it.

01:17:59.116 --> 01:18:00.116
There.

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:03.791
Fuck...

01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:05.066
I don't know

01:18:05.076 --> 01:18:06.791
what I would do without you.
- Stop...

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.499
It's good you're here.

01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:10.624
Thank you.

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.082
What?

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:20.707
It's shocking no one
sees we're a couple.

01:18:20.875 --> 01:18:23.582
Because we're not a couple.
That's why.

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:24.874
But assume.

01:18:25.042 --> 01:18:28.066
What do you believe?
That people think I'm your uncle,

01:18:28.116 --> 01:18:30.624
or your father?
- They see we're together.

01:18:30.792 --> 01:18:32.666
- Whatever.
- Here, look.

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.582
Even on Facebook,
no on cares.

01:18:37.216 --> 01:18:38.856
What are you doing
putting it on Facebook?

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.041
Are you crazy?

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:41.499
How do you delete it?

01:18:41.667 --> 01:18:42.832
Give me that.

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:44.917
Delete it.

01:18:45.083 --> 01:18:47.582
You can't put that on Facebook.
You're deranged.

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:48.750
Louna, delete it.

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:50.874
No, that's all
I have left of you.

01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:52.582
You want to get me in deep shit?

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.457
You'd prefer I tell the truth?

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:57.066
I didn't say that. Your father tried to

01:18:57.076 --> 01:18:58.366
get into your phone.
- Seriously?

01:18:58.417 --> 01:18:59.893
Without the code, we'd be in trouble.

01:18:59.917 --> 01:19:01.916
He's stupid.
My code is too easy.

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:05.082
I'm being serious.
I'm not joking.

01:19:06.833 --> 01:19:09.457
He made up his mind
kill the guy who touched you.

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:11.374
- And this guy...
- It's you.

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:12.957
Ah!

01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:19.416
If I weren't 17 and I
weren't Dad's daughter,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.749
then could you love me?

01:19:24.066 --> 01:19:25.466
That's not the issue.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.716
No, I need to know.

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:29.332
Is it my fault
we can't be together?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.816
Or someone else's fault?

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:33.541
Well...
It's not your fault.

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:36.249
It's a real mess.

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:38.616
That's just how it is.
We shouldn't have.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.041
Louna...

01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:42.791
We'll say that nothing happened.

01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:44.874
Ok?

01:19:45.042 --> 01:19:47.082
I'm almost an adult.
I'll wait.

01:19:47.566 --> 01:19:49.866
You'll always be
your father's daughter.

01:19:49.966 --> 01:19:51.216
My best friend's daughter.

01:19:54.667 --> 01:19:56.816
It sucks to miss the
chance to be happy.

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:58.266
It sucks, but that's how it is.

01:19:58.375 --> 01:20:02.957
Life is for doing things you
remember on your deathbed.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.499
He was there, the fucker!

01:20:47.667 --> 01:20:48.832
I missed him!

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:50.766
You're shooting in the garden?

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:52.266
You're crazy! It's dangerous!

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:54.166
They started it, those bastards!

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:55.966
The fence is useless?

01:20:56.016 --> 01:20:57.816
They ate it!

01:20:57.917 --> 01:21:00.416
They don't care,
they respect nothing!

01:21:00.566 --> 01:21:01.866
I'm going up to my room.

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:03.791
How was the evening?

01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:07.416
Great. You should have come.
It would have changed your mind.

01:21:07.583 --> 01:21:09.582
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:21:09.766 --> 01:21:11.124
Good night, darling.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:15.457
Well, then?

01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:17.957
- So?
- It's ok. Drop your weapon.

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.499
It's alright, I'm a master.

01:21:19.766 --> 01:21:21.466
Master of what? Look at you.

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:23.082
Spill it. The evening.

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:28.791
In my opinion, she's seething at you.

01:21:28.916 --> 01:21:32.166
Listen, with the state I found her
in this morning, there's a guy.

01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:36.832
Not really.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.249
If there is one, he's not 40.

01:21:39.316 --> 01:21:41.416
She told me she told you that

01:21:41.466 --> 01:21:42.766
to get your attention.

01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:45.036
Marie did the same thing
when we divorced.

01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:47.166
Don't compare it!
I'm not getting divorced!

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:50.166
But things aren't so strong either...

01:21:50.333 --> 01:21:52.666
Yes, good. Fine.
Did you tell you who it is?

01:21:53.066 --> 01:21:53.766
No.

01:21:53.833 --> 01:21:55.136
- But you asked?
- Yes.

01:21:55.216 --> 01:21:56.866
- What kind?
- Lots, lots of questions.

01:21:56.958 --> 01:21:58.374
Stop hurrying me!

01:21:58.542 --> 01:22:00.874
I asked... I asked her questions,

01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:02.791
But I couldn't let
her catch on to me.

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:06.316
Three hours and you couldn't
extract the slightest thing.

01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:10.042
One small clue.

01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:13.082
A clue? What, isn't there anything...

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.916
Anything coming back to you?

01:22:15.042 --> 01:22:17.166
A small clue, small...

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:21.791
Well, if you're on the trail,
who are you betting on?

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:26.416
I would say...

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:30.166
Wait, I mean...

01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:32.541
I dunno...

01:22:33.167 --> 01:22:34.999
The DJ, maybe?

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:36.249
The DJ!

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:37.906
Fuck that motherfucker!

01:22:38.016 --> 01:22:40.166
No, wait. I didn't say it <i>was</i> the DJ.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:42.166
I said, "You can ask the DJ."

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:43.749
Damn it, these motherfuckers!

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:47.666
They think they're musicians,
they put on music.

01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:50.416
The girls are fascinated,
it's so easy to...

01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:52.916
Fucker! It's him, it's the DJ.

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:54.083
I'm going to kill him.

01:22:54.167 --> 01:22:56.116
Antoine
I didn't say it was him...

01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:58.291
You're right. It's him.

01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:03.874
That guy isn't 40.

01:23:04.042 --> 01:23:06.999
- Sure, he's 40.
- No, that guy, he's...

01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:10.457
35, tops, I'm telling you.

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:14.866
Antoine...

01:23:27.042 --> 01:23:30.666
Tomorrow morning,
I'll get your daughter one-on-one.

01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:33.082
I see clearly
how to tackle the issue.

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.332
I'll pull it out of her.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:39.874
I'll bring back information.
She won't know what it's about.

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:42.374
Ok? We'll do it tomorrow morning.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:45.249
That settles it, let's go.

01:23:46.583 --> 01:23:48.999
Come, let's go. Stop drinking.

01:23:49.417 --> 01:23:52.216
You're putting yourself in a
ridiculous state. It's ridiculous.

01:23:52.292 --> 01:23:53.716
Come on.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.082
Antoine, it's not him.
I feel it.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:10.541
- Yes, it's him.
- I swear, I have a feeling...

01:24:10.708 --> 01:24:12.749
- It's him!
- No, it's not him.

01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:14.499
- It's him!
- Look at him...

01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:20.249
He's not a horny guy
who fucks girls...

01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:23.506
too young for him.

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:35.866
Fuck!

01:24:47.042 --> 01:24:49.291
You fucked my daughter?
You fucked my daughter?

01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:52.082
What are you doing?
You're crazy! Stop!

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:54.866
I... I don't fuck girls!
I'm gay!

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:56.166
Gay, gay?

01:24:56.333 --> 01:24:58.332
Yes, gay.
I don't like girls, I'm gay!

01:24:58.616 --> 01:25:00.866
- See?
- You couldn't say that before?

01:25:00.958 --> 01:25:02.541
He's gay, it's not him.

01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:11.457
It was you who told me
it was the DJ.

01:25:11.625 --> 01:25:13.499
It was you who told me
it was the DJ.

01:25:13.667 --> 01:25:14.957
Come on, come on.

01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:17.316
- It was you who told me...
- It doesn't matter.

01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:20.916
- Stop being stupid.
- You told me it was the DJ.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:22.999
No, that's not true.

01:25:23.167 --> 01:25:26.457
- So I invented it?
- I said maybe.

01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:27.874
- No...
- I said maybe!

01:25:28.116 --> 01:25:30.565
I asked you, and
you said, "It's the DJ."

01:25:30.566 --> 01:25:31.716
Calm down.

01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:42.291
You said, "It's the DJ."

01:25:42.458 --> 01:25:43.957
You're crazy. You're all wrong.

01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:45.957
I asked you
twenty times who it was.

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:47.766
You said, "It's the DJ."

01:25:47.816 --> 01:25:49.832
I said "maybe."
I didn't...

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.499
You didn't say "maybe."

01:25:51.667 --> 01:25:53.666
I said, "Are you sure?"
You said yes, the DJ.

01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:55.582
"It's the DJ, it's the DJ."

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:58.207
You repeated it.
- Stop! Stop!

01:25:58.375 --> 01:26:01.082
You're completely drunk,
and you're all wrong.

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.582
Fuck!

01:26:13.625 --> 01:26:16.082
Stupid bullshit!

01:26:31.333 --> 01:26:33.791
- You're completely sick.
- Yeah, that's it.

01:26:33.958 --> 01:26:36.124
It's me who's sick.

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:38.124
- You went there with that?
- Shh.

01:26:42.216 --> 01:26:43.266
What?

01:26:44.016 --> 01:26:45.566
What?

01:26:48.066 --> 01:26:49.116
Stop.

01:26:56.116 --> 01:26:57.416
Stop, stop.

01:26:58.083 --> 01:26:59.457
Fucker!

01:27:11.667 --> 01:27:13.541
It's Loukoum.

01:27:17.916 --> 01:27:19.116
No, no.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.416
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.499
I wanted to apologize for last night.

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:57.624
- I was being awful.
- It's fine.

01:27:58.208 --> 01:28:00.332
No, I wasn't respectful to you.

01:28:00.667 --> 01:28:02.374
I swear, I regret it.

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:06.374
It happens to everyone.
It's ok.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:08.750
Sorry.

01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:09.792
Yeah...

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:11.749
It's ok.

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:14.041
I'm coming.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.666
Have you seen Loukoum?

01:28:21.833 --> 01:28:22.833
Oh, fuck.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.750
Loukoum?

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.066
Who's Loukoum?

01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:27.375
My dog.

01:28:27.958 --> 01:28:29.332
He's always around.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.457
He would never miss
his breakfast.

01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:33.249
I can't find him anywhere.

01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:36.066
If we see him, we'll bring him back.

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:39.566
Yes... Oh, you have boars?

01:28:40.708 --> 01:28:43.041
They destroyed your garden.

01:28:43.208 --> 01:28:45.957
They were in mine too.
We'll start a hunt.

01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:48.541
Sure. I fenced it and it's useless.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
See you later.

01:28:51.542 --> 01:28:52.749
No, but really...

01:28:52.917 --> 01:28:55.116
Killing poor animals...
You're deplorable people.

01:28:56.216 --> 01:28:57.466
What are you talking about?

01:28:57.833 --> 01:28:59.166
What's she talking about?

01:29:03.016 --> 01:29:04.457
Fine then. Marie!

01:29:06.417 --> 01:29:07.499
Marie!

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:08.999
It's nonstop.

01:29:10.316 --> 01:29:12.016
- It's one or the other.
- What?

01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:15.082
When it's not one,
it's the other.

01:29:36.466 --> 01:29:37.516
I didn't say come in.

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.416
Don't talk to me like that.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.624
How should I talk to you?

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.749
Like a daughter to her father.

01:29:42.917 --> 01:29:44.416
The father
fucking my best friend?

01:29:44.792 --> 01:29:46.707
Stop...

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:52.082
I didn't fuck your friend.
That's not what happened.

01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:54.541
Sorry.
You made love to her, is that it?

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.499
What do you want me to say?

01:29:58.716 --> 01:30:01.416
That I'm not proud of it? Yes.
That I feel guilty?

01:30:01.666 --> 01:30:04.516
That I'm sorry?
Yes, I'm sorry. Please...

01:30:04.583 --> 01:30:05.766
Do you ever think about me?

01:30:06.066 --> 01:30:07.268
I think about you all the time, Marie.

01:30:07.292 --> 01:30:08.332
And about Mom too?

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.457
Mom, leave her be.

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:13.166
I'm divorced.
It's for you that I'm sorry.

01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:14.707
I'm sorry, Marie...

01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:16.999
But look at you, you're pathetic!

01:30:17.375 --> 01:30:20.832
You try to be the cool dad,
but you're worse than Antoine.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:22.874
Marie, please...

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:26.207
- I...
- Don't even touch me.

01:30:27.583 --> 01:30:29.041
Fuck you!

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:02.874
- Antoine!
- Stop...

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.957
You're going to be
working with your friend.

01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:09.124
The dogs will track the boars.

01:31:09.292 --> 01:31:11.374
- Ok.
- I'm up there with Ange.

01:31:11.542 --> 01:31:12.999
Sounds good.

01:31:16.542 --> 01:31:17.749
Let's go.

01:32:17.708 --> 01:32:19.207
Ibiza...

01:32:20.375 --> 01:32:21.375
What?

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:23.332
Ibiza...

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:29.457
Why did I piss her off?

01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:32.041
I'm going to lose her...

01:32:33.458 --> 01:32:34.916
I swear...

01:32:35.625 --> 01:32:38.499
Behaving like shit,
I'll lose her.

01:32:40.667 --> 01:32:42.082
I yell...

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.316
I yell because

01:32:44.583 --> 01:32:46.624
she wants to go
partying in Ibiza.

01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:48.916
And I want to bang the crêpe girl.

01:32:50.042 --> 01:32:51.582
I'm a shitty person.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.249
We're all the same.

01:32:53.417 --> 01:32:54.624
- No...
- Yes.

01:32:54.792 --> 01:32:56.374
- No, you, you're clear.
- Yes.

01:32:57.066 --> 01:33:00.166
You're clear, honest.
If you have something to say, you say it.

01:33:00.292 --> 01:33:01.582
You see how I am.

01:33:01.917 --> 01:33:03.499
I'm incapable of...

01:33:03.667 --> 01:33:05.874
I'm incapable,
I'm not honest.

01:33:06.042 --> 01:33:09.082
You haven't been very clear.
You're not well behaved.

01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:10.749
This is true.

01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:13.457
You must see that.
It's true you were on the edge.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.499
But I know you.
It doesn't make you an asshole.

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:18.416
No. No.

01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:22.082
Antoine, I assure you,
we all have darker sides.

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:24.207
No. When you got divorced...

01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:26.316
When you got divorced, I knew very well.

01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:27.374
With Virginie,

01:33:27.416 --> 01:33:29.457
you would have fights.
You were unhappy.

01:33:29.625 --> 01:33:32.374
But you said things.
It was clear, proper.

01:33:32.542 --> 01:33:34.874
I'm not clear.
I want to be like you.

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:36.624
- One has to say things.
- Yes.

01:33:36.792 --> 01:33:39.016
That's what I mean.
But I don't say them, you do.

01:33:39.333 --> 01:33:42.124
Sometimes I try to say things
but I can't, you know?

01:33:42.292 --> 01:33:46.291
It's the people who hold the most in
with whom we have the most trouble.

01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:49.366
Sometimes, we try to share
something burdening us

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:52.707
and the person, he has other things to do,
he has his own problems. Understand?

01:33:53.625 --> 01:33:54.957
Antoine.

01:33:56.917 --> 01:33:58.457
Me, sometimes I want...

01:33:59.666 --> 01:34:03.066
to confide everything but I feel
like you're caught up in other things.

01:34:03.125 --> 01:34:06.416
It's normal. We lug around our...
That is to say,

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:09.916
we're all the same.
We have moments of weakness.

01:34:11.036 --> 01:34:12.716
And we regret it afterwards.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:21.124
Antoine...

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.041
There it is!

01:34:25.917 --> 01:34:27.999
Antoine... Antoine, it's me.

01:34:30.917 --> 01:34:31.999
Ah, damn.

01:34:37.125 --> 01:34:39.249
I know. Antoine...

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.082
I'm sorry.

01:34:42.875 --> 01:34:45.249
Hey! Hold it! Hold it!

01:34:45.417 --> 01:34:47.124
Hold it!

01:34:47.292 --> 01:34:49.207
I swear I didn't want to!

01:34:50.083 --> 01:34:52.999
Stop! Stop!

01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:56.957
Stop! Stop, please!

01:34:57.125 --> 01:35:00.166
Please, stop!
Stop, stop.

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:02.999
Antoine, stop!

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.266
- Antoine...
- What?

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:34.124
- Next time, you tell me...
- What?

01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:37.374
I don't know why you
beat the disc jockey.

01:35:37.542 --> 01:35:39.291
But if you have a problem...

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:42.624
You tell me, eh?
For the memory of your father.

01:35:42.792 --> 01:35:44.457
We'll deal with it.

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.124
Where's your friend?

01:35:50.292 --> 01:35:53.124
- I don't know, he cleared out.
- How's he getting back?

01:35:53.292 --> 01:35:54.916
He'll manage.

01:36:18.833 --> 01:36:20.616
It's weird, they're not answering.

01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:22.166
Well...

01:36:23.333 --> 01:36:25.582
Maybe they don't have any signal.

01:36:31.616 --> 01:36:32.616
Marie...

01:36:33.208 --> 01:36:34.208
What?

01:36:34.875 --> 01:36:36.124
I'm sorry.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
You can.

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:43.291
Really, it's not his fault.
I wanted you to know.

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:46.957
A little bit, though.

01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:48.499
No, it's me.

01:36:49.816 --> 01:36:51.616
You know, he's the adult.

01:37:09.416 --> 01:37:11.816
<i>We're at a party.
See you later, M & L</i>

01:39:49.833 --> 01:39:53.291

01:39:54.333 --> 01:39:55.499

01:39:55.667 --> 01:39:56.916

01:39:57.083 --> 01:39:58.416
Bye, Louna.

01:40:11.042 --> 01:40:12.332
What happened?

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.541
Nothing.

01:40:18.833 --> 01:40:20.916
We were waiting for you.
