00:38.172 --> 00:42.941
- Do you remember what I
told you the other night?

00:42.943 --> 00:47.179
Close your eyes, count to
five, and take a deep breath.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.951
It's all in your
imagination, I promise.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.833
There are no ghosts
in this house.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.368
There's no monster under the bed

01:09.370 --> 01:13.605
and there's definitely no
bad man in your cupboard.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.910
Now, come on, go back to sleep.

01:31.859 --> 01:35.494
Look, let's talk about
this in the morning.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.787
- Look, it's been going
on for three nights, now.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.022
It has to stop.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.456
- Will you give her a break?

03:11.458 --> 03:15.294
It's just gonna take her a
while to settle in, that's all.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.262
- Right, so in the
meantime I just keep goin'

03:17.264 --> 03:19.932
to work with only two
hours sleep every night.

03:19.934 --> 03:23.368
- Honestly, that room
gives me the creeps, too.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.103
Why don't we set her
up in another room?

03:25.105 --> 03:27.839
Just until that
one's been decorated.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.807
- Great idea, yeah.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.510
Let's spend some more money.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.145
- It was your idea to move here.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.379
- Drop it.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.416
Thank you, thanks for
reminding me again.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.651
- Let's not do this today.

03:41.989 --> 03:45.824
- So, you finally decided
to get up, did you?

03:51.365 --> 03:54.833
- There's cereal on the counter.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.835
- Oh yeah, remember I've
got a meeting tonight,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.870
so I'm going to be back late.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.372
- How late?

04:00.374 --> 04:01.374
- Late.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.711
Come on, silly,
you heard your mom,

04:05.713 --> 04:06.945
cereal's on the counter.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.815
You don't wanna be
late for school.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.321
- Mike?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.174
Mike.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.533
- Please.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.494
- Hello.

07:18.505 --> 07:19.905
I got your card.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.644
It's Jack, Jack Donavan.

07:35.823 --> 07:39.324
- Hello,
is anyone there?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.326
Hello.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.862
Ah, thank God.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.831
I thought I was going mad.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.233
And if I am mad,
then it is mercy.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.169
May the gods pity the man
who, in his callousness,

07:51.171 --> 07:54.139
remains sane until
the hideous end.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.176
Jonathan Blazer, and you are?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.579
- Jack, Jack Donavan.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.913
- Yes, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Jack.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.416
Now, how can I be of service?

08:04.418 --> 08:07.319
- That's what I
was gonna ask you.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.523
I got this card with
this house's address

08:11.525 --> 08:13.825
and my name on it.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.527
- Well, that is interesting.

08:15.529 --> 08:20.298
I found this card in my
mailbox about two days ago.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.533
Plot thickens.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.670
- Maybe I can be
of help, gentlemen.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.108
If you'd follow me.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.015
In front of you
lies over 200 years

08:38.018 --> 08:42.419
of this building's history
dating back to the 18th century.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.422
I can assure you that everything

08:44.424 --> 08:48.426
in that document took
place within these walls.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.996
We invited you both here,

08:50.998 --> 08:52.464
based purely on your reputation

08:52.466 --> 08:55.166
within this particular field.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.102
My client was very specific

08:57.104 --> 09:01.273
that you two, and only you
two, should be contacted.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.945
- So, what exactly is
it I can do to help,

09:06.947 --> 09:10.115
a little house
clearance, seance maybe,

09:10.117 --> 09:12.617
something to spook the spooks?

09:12.619 --> 09:15.654
A little John Blazer special.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.055
- So, your a medium.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.158
- Certainly not, I'm a psychic.

09:20.160 --> 09:25.063
And dare I say the best they
have in this two-horse town.

09:25.065 --> 09:29.234
- Look, I appreciate
your client's invitation

09:29.236 --> 09:31.469
but firstly, I work alone,

09:33.006 --> 09:35.540
and secondly, I work in the
realms of the real world.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.008
- Yuck.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.743
- If you're looking for some
kind of paranormal clown

09:38.745 --> 09:40.845
to promote this place
to the tourists,

09:40.847 --> 09:42.747
then believe me, you've
got the wrong man.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.083
- So, I take it
you're a nonbeliever.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.618
- I believe you're full of shit.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.421
- Wow, I mean that's just
unprofessional, isn't it?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.289
- I make a living out
of exposing frauds,

09:51.291 --> 09:53.058
and trust me when I say this,

09:53.060 --> 09:54.526
I'm the best at what I do.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.094
- See, I'm sensing a
little bit of hostility.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.163
It's coming from this
side of the sofa.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.497
I mean, are you getting this?

09:59.499 --> 10:00.665
- Is this the best you could do?

10:00.667 --> 10:02.167
Is this some kind of joke?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.802
- I would appreciate it if
you'd read through the files

10:03.804 --> 10:07.005
before making any rash
decisions, Mr. Donavan.

10:07.007 --> 10:11.009
There is a substantial fee
attached to this proposition.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.912
- Exactly how much
are we talking?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.481
- 50,000 US dollars.

10:19.853 --> 10:23.054
- I'm sorry, you want to
pay us 50,000 US dollars?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.223
- 50,000 US dollars each.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.562
- Well, I mean, it's a little
less than my normal fee,

10:30.564 --> 10:32.430
but I think under the
circumstances we could make....

10:32.432 --> 10:36.001
- This is a very serious
matter, Mr. Blazer.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.536
Money is of no relevance to my
client providing you can get

10:38.538 --> 10:41.306
this unfortunate
situation cleared up

10:41.308 --> 10:44.042
within the allocated time.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.879
- But you still haven't told
us what this is all about.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.525
And all these deaths
took place in this house?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.961
- That's as far back
as the records go.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.531
For all we know, there
could be many more.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.370
- Jesus, what happened
to these people?

11:16.710 --> 11:18.076
- Who's the stiff?

11:18.078 --> 11:20.178
- His name was Mr. Johnston.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.646
His family were
the last residents

11:21.648 --> 11:24.649
to look after this property.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.151
- He's not going to
get his deposit back.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.186
- Unfortunately, previous
owners would not accept

11:28.188 --> 11:29.721
the history of this house,

11:29.723 --> 11:31.222
and would occasionally
try to rent it out

11:31.224 --> 11:33.258
to unsuspecting tenants.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.994
As you can see, this
is a huge building.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.128
It requires a great deal

11:37.130 --> 11:39.998
of attention dedicated
to its upkeep.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.634
- What were the results
of the autopsy report?

11:42.636 --> 11:46.838
- Stabbings, hanging,
mutilation, gun fire,

11:46.840 --> 11:48.306
the list goes on.

11:50.077 --> 11:53.912
But that's where things
get a little strange.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.916
- What could be
stranger than this?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.617
- The Johnston's only
lived in this house

11:59.619 --> 12:03.021
for a couple of days before
the murders took place.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.958
They were killed by their
own 13-year-old daughter

12:06.960 --> 12:09.828
in what looked like
an unprovoked attack.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.762
- Teenagers.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.964
- What happened to the daughter?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.533
- She was found dead upstairs
in a bedroom cupboard,

12:15.535 --> 12:17.001
apparent suicide.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.871
- Apparent suicide?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.440
- She was stabbed to death,

12:22.442 --> 12:24.209
but the police could only
find her fingerprints

12:24.211 --> 12:25.376
on the knife.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.748
And what makes it so strange

12:29.750 --> 12:32.217
was the fact that she
died from knife wounds

12:32.219 --> 12:33.618
to her own back.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.856
- She stabbed
herself in the back?

12:39.659 --> 12:42.594
- Eight times to be precise.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.495
- How's that even possible?

12:43.497 --> 12:45.029
That doesn't make sense.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.564
- I wish I could tell you more,

12:46.566 --> 12:48.633
but that's everything I know.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.401
I have included the
official police reports

12:50.403 --> 12:54.639
for you both to read over
at your own convenience.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.979
The reputation of this house
has grown over the years.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.047
The murders have
created a legend

13:03.049 --> 13:04.549
that doesn't exactly bode well

13:04.551 --> 13:08.019
with my client's current
business interests.

13:08.021 --> 13:12.056
Half up front, and half
when you complete the job.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.191
- Well, this all sounds amazing,

13:13.193 --> 13:15.660
but what exactly is the job?

13:15.662 --> 13:16.928
- Damage control.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.530
I'm guessing they wanna
offload this place

13:18.532 --> 13:20.799
to some poor unsuspecting buyer.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.667
And I bet you nobody wants

13:22.669 --> 13:26.838
to touch this place
with its track record.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.072
Am I right?

13:28.074 --> 13:30.241
- And what better
way than to get two

13:30.243 --> 13:33.411
of the very best
to reassure them.

13:33.413 --> 13:38.349
You'd be very surprised how
superstitious people can be.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.586
- So, what is it exactly
that you want us to do?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.055
- Three nights, you stay here

13:44.057 --> 13:46.724
for three uninterrupted nights,

13:48.094 --> 13:51.896
and then report your findings
back to me, and only to me.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.632
- That's it?

13:54.634 --> 13:57.502
You're gonna pay us 50,000
grand just to have a sleepover?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.404
- We will, of course, be
contacting the local press

13:59.406 --> 14:01.906
to make people aware
of what we are doing.

14:01.908 --> 14:04.175
Maximum exposure is crucial

14:04.177 --> 14:07.145
to making this a
success for my client.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.348
- And what if we find something?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.450
- Let me make this clear,

14:12.452 --> 14:14.886
you're findings will show

14:14.888 --> 14:17.155
that this residence
is nothing more

14:17.157 --> 14:18.723
than an old house.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.527
You'll both state that your
stay here was uneventful

14:22.529 --> 14:25.763
and that you found
nothing strange,

14:25.765 --> 14:29.067
supernatural, or
paranormal whatsoever.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.837
- What's the catch?

14:32.839 --> 14:36.441
- No catch, just look at is as
a paid holiday for you both.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.642
- And if we refuse?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.944
- Oh, of course,
we'll take the job.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.145
When do we start?

14:41.147 --> 14:43.248
- You started already.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.717
Everything's been arranged
to accommodate your stay.

14:45.719 --> 14:49.621
- No offense, but conning
people isn't exactly

14:50.423 --> 14:52.757
what I get paid to do.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.526
- Mr. Donavan, I
fully understand

14:55.528 --> 14:57.428
and appreciate your honestly.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.663
- It's $50,000.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.765
- But unfortunately,
the offer only stands

15:00.767 --> 15:03.801
if both of you agree
to participate.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.039
- I knew you were
gonna say that.

15:08.041 --> 15:12.277
- I need your phones and your
car keys if you possess them.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.513
This is a publicity
stunt, gentlemen.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.416
We need it to look as
genuine as possible.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.485
- Chop, chop, come on.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.887
- This is non-negotiable,
I'm afraid.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.821
- What is it?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.323
Is there porn on the phone?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.393
It's porn on the phone,
I'm sensing, there we go.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.728
- Excellent, I'll
return your phones

15:30.730 --> 15:34.799
and your vehicles once
you've completed the job.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.074
One last thing.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.976
- Here it comes.

15:44.978 --> 15:48.579
- The building will be secured
for the full three days.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.048
No one will be able to get in,

15:50.050 --> 15:52.417
and no one will be
able to get out.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.320
If however, either
of you wish to leave

15:55.322 --> 15:58.056
before the agreed
allocated time,

15:58.058 --> 16:02.126
you'll both forfeit the
second part of your payment.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.861
- You're locking us in here?

16:03.863 --> 16:07.765
- My client was very adamant
about this condition.

16:07.767 --> 16:08.900
- What about a
change of clothes?

16:08.902 --> 16:10.501
I didn't bring any with me.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.670
- Why three days?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.339
- Because that's as long
as anyone's ever lasted

16:14.341 --> 16:16.474
in this house, allegedly.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.045
- Trust me, I've
heard it all before.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.447
- Good luck, gentlemen.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.783
Have a pleasant stay
at Richmond Manor.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.157
- That seem weird to you?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.159
Nah.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.329
Finally, my luck
is about to change.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.064
Where are you going?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.970
Was he serious
about the clothes?

16:45.972 --> 16:48.806
I can't wear this
for three days.

16:48.808 --> 16:49.808
Rented.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.897
Wow, well that is a lot of belt.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.099
What is all this stuff?

17:16.102 --> 17:19.303
- Just so we're clear,
don't touch anything.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.338
You understand?
- Yep.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.339
- Stay away from my equipment.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.540
- Sure.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.575
- Off limits, private
property, Capiche?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.377
- Absolutely, kemosabe,
I respect you.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.646
I've just never seen
anything like this.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.849
- Well, that's because all of
this is high-tech equipment,

17:31.851 --> 17:33.384
science based.

17:33.386 --> 17:38.189
Something I'm guessing
you're not too familiar with.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.192
- See, I'm sensing you have a
problem with people like me.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.061
- What do you mean,
people like you?

17:43.063 --> 17:47.231
- Oh, psychics, mediums,
the rakishly good looking.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.467
- Not really, I
just have a problem

17:49.469 --> 17:51.469
with what you people
do for a living.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.870
- I help people.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.108
- More like, help yourself.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.376
- Not everything
can be explained

17:58.378 --> 18:02.046
with high-tech gadgets
and fancy belts, Jack.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.682
What I have is a gift,

18:04.684 --> 18:08.653
or a curse, depending
on how you look at it.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.587
- Do you know how
many people I've met

18:09.589 --> 18:11.889
like you over the years?

18:11.891 --> 18:14.192
They're all full of
the same old bullshit,

18:14.194 --> 18:16.527
anything to make a quick buck.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.429
- Oh, do enlighten me.

18:19.532 --> 18:23.601
- All right, you say you
can speak to the dead,

18:23.603 --> 18:25.903
see ghosts, or demons,
or whatever the crap

18:25.905 --> 18:28.139
you guys are selling these days.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.041
Well, go on, prove it.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.210
Summon the dead right now.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.544
Make me a believer.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.713
- It doesn't work like that.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.949
- Of course, it doesn't.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.419
There's always an
excuse with you people.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.523
You see this?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.259
This is how I prove things.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.894
This is how I work.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.029
- I fail to see the point.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.566
He's paying us to sit
here and do nothing.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.838
- You see, that's the
difference between us.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.807
I'm not here for the money.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.443
If all this is bullshit,

19:05.445 --> 19:07.879
and I can guarantee you it is,

19:07.881 --> 19:10.181
I'm gonna prove it, myself.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.593
- This is gonna be
a long three days.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.311
Bingo.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.713
I'm sensing the booze is in.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.350
Well, I suppose you'll do.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.391
I found the food.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.628
I mean, it's not La
Zou, but it'll do.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.572
High-tech equipment, whoop.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.048
Note to jack, you're a dick.

21:16.809 --> 21:17.942
Still got it.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.917
You having fun up there, Jack?

22:31.818 --> 22:33.217
- Jack.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.051
- What do you want?

22:34.053 --> 22:35.519
I'm working here.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.808
- Jack.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.447
- This better be good.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.403
If this is some kind of
joke, I swear to God.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.771
Jonathan.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.729
- Jesus, what,
what the hell, man!

24:25.731 --> 24:26.664
What do you want?

24:26.666 --> 24:27.998
- Well, I found something.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.533
- What did you find?

24:29.535 --> 24:32.870
- Oh no, no, no, this
I have to show you.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.939
- Were you in this room?

24:34.941 --> 24:37.808
- No, that door's locked,
I tried it earlier.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.810
Come on.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.648
Come on, Jack.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.188
Huh, huh?

24:52.525 --> 24:55.192
Isn't this the greatest
thing you've ever seen?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.094
I mean, look at this stuff.

24:57.096 --> 25:00.130
Imagine the children who
got to play with this.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.866
Spoiled little shits.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.436
These people must
have been loaded.

25:05.438 --> 25:08.305
- Great, is that it, can I go?

25:08.307 --> 25:09.740
- Clearly, you have
no appreciation

25:09.742 --> 25:12.042
for the art of the
scaled miniature.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.010
Luckily, I think
I found something

25:13.012 --> 25:15.479
a little bit more your speed.

25:16.616 --> 25:19.483
- Double-barrel Briska
Italian made shotgun.

25:19.485 --> 25:20.584
- Shit, this thing's loaded.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.153
- Whoa, careful with that thing.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.221
You're gonna hurt yourself.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.991
- Go on, take my picture.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.127
John Blazer, hunter,
gatherer, lover.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.001
- That'll look
great on my website,

25:37.003 --> 25:40.404
right next to all the
other con artists.

25:51.918 --> 25:52.750
What the?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.418
- What, what now?

25:54.420 --> 25:56.820
- What did I say about
touching my equipment?

25:56.822 --> 25:57.988
Look at this.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.292
What are you, five?

26:01.294 --> 26:04.295
- Look, I'm sorry about
touching your stuff.

26:04.297 --> 26:06.697
That was out of line.

26:06.699 --> 26:10.167
I'm just not used to
working with people.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.405
I tell you what,
I'll go upstairs,

26:14.407 --> 26:15.673
and I'll set up in a room,

26:15.675 --> 26:19.443
and I'll just try and
keep out of your way.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.011
You know, if that's
what you want.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.247
- Yes, that's what I want.

26:25.484 --> 26:26.484
- Okay.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.963
If you've come to
shout at me again,

26:38.965 --> 26:40.864
I'd rather you didn't.

26:42.868 --> 26:47.037
- Actually, I was thinking
about apologizing.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.772
- You were thinking?

26:51.410 --> 26:54.645
- I haven't quite
made my mind up yet.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.485
What's that for?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.322
- So, you're interested
in how I work

27:05.324 --> 27:07.324
all of a sudden, are you?

27:07.326 --> 27:08.959
- What is it?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.495
- Well, this my friend,
is sodium chloride.

27:11.497 --> 27:12.596
And you probably
wouldn't understand,

27:12.598 --> 27:15.265
it's a little bit scientific.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.600
- Why salt?

27:16.602 --> 27:18.502
- It's for protection.

27:19.705 --> 27:23.340
Nothing bad can touch
me while I'm in here.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.677
Not even you.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.113
- So, you think this
stuff actually works?

27:29.115 --> 27:32.516
- No, do you know
what a Ouija board is?

27:33.619 --> 27:36.587
- Well, everybody knows
what a Ouija board is.

27:36.589 --> 27:39.857
- Look, you have all your
high-tech toys and gadgets,

27:39.859 --> 27:41.659
this is what I have.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.995
As to your next question,
yes, it does work.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.364
Sometimes, a little too well.

27:47.366 --> 27:51.201
Poor Mrs. Bracket, she
really loved that dog.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.907
Are you sure you want to
be around when I do this?

27:56.909 --> 27:58.308
I know you're not a believer,

27:58.310 --> 28:01.545
and that's probably
gonna kick off, so.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.082
- I'm curious.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.488
I wanna see how
you do what you do.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.791
Besides, I thought you
were just on holiday.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.025
- You kidding?

28:15.027 --> 28:17.127
A house with this
kind of history.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.030
We should be covered in ghosts.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.231
- Well, why don't you ask them

28:21.233 --> 28:24.001
what next week's
lottery numbers are?

28:24.003 --> 28:25.202
- How's a ghost supposed to know

28:25.204 --> 28:28.005
what next week's
lottery numbers are?

28:28.007 --> 28:31.341
Most of them don't
even know they're dead.

28:31.343 --> 28:35.012
Look, are you gonna let
me do this thing, or not?

28:35.014 --> 28:38.382
- You're the expert,
I'm just observing.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.356
- If there is anyone
present in this house

28:46.358 --> 28:50.594
make yourselves known to me
through the spirit board.

28:57.670 --> 28:59.503
Well, that's
probably a good sign.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.038
- What is?

29:01.040 --> 29:03.607
- Trust me, silence is better
when you're using this thing,

29:03.609 --> 29:06.977
especially in a house like this.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.279
It takes a little while, okay?

29:09.281 --> 29:11.582
I'm just getting warmed up.

29:18.491 --> 29:22.459
By the gibbous moon and
the five-pointed star,

29:22.461 --> 29:25.496
while the sky is
bruised and broken,

29:25.498 --> 29:28.198
hear my voice and heed my call,

29:28.200 --> 29:31.635
any spirits present
make yourselves known,

29:31.637 --> 29:34.037
and move the pointer to yes.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.479
Like I said, takes
a little time.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.383
- Same old bullshit.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.520
- Your wife must have
the patience of a saint.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.054
- What did you say?

29:51.056 --> 29:52.723
- Must be a bit
of a strain to....

29:52.725 --> 29:55.459
- Don't you dare
talk about my wife.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.362
You don't know
anything about her.

30:07.139 --> 30:11.308
- Thanks, guys, you made
me look a right asshole.

30:12.645 --> 30:16.446
Oh, is there some other house
you have to go and haunt?

30:54.854 --> 30:55.919
Who are you?

31:03.262 --> 31:04.928
What do you want?

31:48.941 --> 31:49.941
- Rebecca.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.711
- He made me do it.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.880
- Oh, what have you done?

32:04.890 --> 32:05.890
No!

33:16.662 --> 33:18.962
A slight drop in temperature
of the girl's room,

33:18.964 --> 33:21.098
from 15 to eight degrees.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.006
- Morning.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.486
You're up early.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.756
- Couldn't sleep.

33:45.758 --> 33:48.792
- That's hardly surprising.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.762
Not exactly bedtime
reading, is it?

33:52.931 --> 33:55.432
What's your take on all this?

33:57.236 --> 34:00.604
- I'm sure there's a
rational explanation.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.972
There always is.

34:03.709 --> 34:04.641
- I'm beginning
to think agreeing

34:04.643 --> 34:07.744
to stay here was a grave error.

34:07.746 --> 34:08.745
- I think your not
taking a change

34:08.746 --> 34:11.248
of clothes was a grave error.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.420
- I know you don't
wanna hear this,

34:17.422 --> 34:19.255
but something
happened last night.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.757
I got a message on the board.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.632
- You're right, I
don't wanna hear it.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.969
- Two nights left.

34:33.972 --> 34:38.208
Whatever this thing is, it's
counting down our stay here.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.476
- Wake up, Jonathan.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.579
Somebody's playing
games with us.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.414
We're not alone.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.018
Last night, I saw somebody
else in this house.

34:48.020 --> 34:52.255
And whoever it is, they have
access to the building somehow.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.592
- Oh, that can't be good.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.532
Whoa, what did I do?

35:02.534 --> 35:04.367
- Motion sensor.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.369
- What?

35:10.476 --> 35:12.976
- If there's anything
moving around up here,

35:12.978 --> 35:15.045
I'm gonna know about it.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.647
- And what if it's not a person?

35:17.649 --> 35:18.582
Have you even considered that?

35:18.584 --> 35:19.950
- How much do we actually know

35:19.952 --> 35:23.253
about the man who hired us, huh?

35:23.255 --> 35:25.755
For all we know,
we're just pawns

35:25.757 --> 35:27.958
in some fucked up PR stunt.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.892
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised

35:28.894 --> 35:30.060
if this is all just a ploy

35:30.062 --> 35:31.862
to get dumb tourists
to visit their

35:31.864 --> 35:35.198
newly acquired haunted
house attraction.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.068
Let's face it, we're in
the middle of nowhere.

35:38.070 --> 35:41.171
- Those pictures
look real to me.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.806
- Even if they are,

35:43.909 --> 35:46.176
that doesn't explain
what I saw last night.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.178
- And what if it's
not a PR stunt?

35:48.180 --> 35:50.080
The thing I made contact
with knows we're here.

35:50.082 --> 35:53.984
And trust me, that
is not a good thing.

35:53.986 --> 35:54.986
Jack.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.321
Jack, please listen to me.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.358
I think we might be in
some genuine danger.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.960
- Enough to forfeit your
share of the money, Jonathan?

36:03.962 --> 36:06.196
No one's keeping you here.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.032
- Oh great, where
am I gonna go, hmm?

36:09.034 --> 36:11.001
We're in the middle
of cocking nowhere.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.669
No phones, no cars.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.209
- What the hell is
going on out here?

37:59.211 --> 38:00.944
- I just saw someone.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.545
- What did you see?

38:09.321 --> 38:10.887
- Grab the camera.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.562
Shit!

38:29.174 --> 38:33.376
- Well, he didn't say
anything about having a pool.

38:33.378 --> 38:36.880
This is definitely
better than the train.

38:37.683 --> 38:38.683
Oh.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.018
For your website.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.669
What did you see?

39:00.572 --> 39:01.971
- I don't know.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.273
- Don't know?

39:03.275 --> 39:05.075
Or don't want to say?

39:10.916 --> 39:13.550
- It looked like a little girl.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.596
- Was it this little girl?

40:24.089 --> 40:27.824
- No, tell me that's
not what I think it is.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.230
I think it's high
time we talk about

40:34.232 --> 40:36.166
what I think we're
dealing with here.

40:36.168 --> 40:37.867
- We're dealing
with a real person,

40:37.869 --> 40:39.836
not some phantom spook.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.738
- Jack, I've watched you
fumble about this house

40:41.740 --> 40:45.475
for the last 36 hours with
your gadgets and gizmos.

40:45.477 --> 40:48.278
Now, it's high time
you listened to me.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.280
Open it.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.822
- What is this?

40:58.824 --> 41:00.990
- Demonology, the study
of ancient demons,

41:00.992 --> 41:03.059
their legends, and
more importantly,

41:03.061 --> 41:05.628
how to get rid of them.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.997
- So, you really think a ghost
left that thing in my room?

41:07.999 --> 41:10.233
- Not a ghost, a demon.

41:10.235 --> 41:13.403
Ghosts are easy to move on,
they're my bread and butter.

41:13.405 --> 41:16.473
But a demon, that's an entirely
different beast altogether.

41:16.475 --> 41:19.075
- Okay, let's just say for one
minute I'm buying that crap.

41:19.077 --> 41:20.276
- What's to buy, Jack?

41:20.278 --> 41:21.411
You're sitting in
the middle of a house

41:21.413 --> 41:22.912
where entire
generations of families

41:22.914 --> 41:25.882
have either murdered each
other or committed suicide.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.917
- If you're so
convinced it's a demon,

41:27.919 --> 41:29.519
why can't you get rid of it?

41:29.521 --> 41:32.922
- Oh sure, yeah, just
get rid of it, hmm?

41:32.924 --> 41:34.991
It's not that simple.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.795
- But you're experienced
in this, aren't you?

41:40.832 --> 41:43.166
But you have this?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.835
- I've never actually
had to use that thing.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.971
It's mostly for show.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.006
- Well, isn't that convenient?

41:50.008 --> 41:51.941
- Look, this isn't my MO, okay.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.078
I'm used to moving on
stubborn dead people.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.346
This is different.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.614
- How?

41:57.616 --> 42:00.149
- Because demons aren't human.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.986
Their soul purpose is
to torment the living,

42:02.988 --> 42:06.923
to cause as much pain and
suffering as possible.

42:06.925 --> 42:10.827
Truth is, nobody knows
what these things are.

42:10.829 --> 42:14.063
- Then how do you know that
we're dealing with one?

42:14.065 --> 42:17.166
- Case after case,
all have classic signs

42:17.168 --> 42:19.202
of demonic possession.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.604
Parents murdered by
their own daughter.

42:21.606 --> 42:22.739
You think it's a
coincidence you're seeing

42:22.741 --> 42:26.142
little girls
running around here?

42:26.144 --> 42:27.844
This hapless
handyman came around

42:27.846 --> 42:29.512
to fix the washing machine.

42:29.514 --> 42:32.448
An hour later, he hung
himself out to dry.

42:32.450 --> 42:36.653
Murder after murder,
suicide after suicide.

42:36.655 --> 42:40.723
No previous convictions and
no history of mental illness.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.225
I mean, look at this.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.159
How do you shoot
yourself in the back

42:43.161 --> 42:45.094
of the head with a rifle?

42:45.096 --> 42:47.764
- Okay, you've made your point.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.600
Start reading this.

42:50.602 --> 42:51.968
If it is what you say it is,

42:51.970 --> 42:55.538
then we need to know
how to get rid of it.

42:56.675 --> 42:59.609
But if you're wrong
and it's not a demon,

42:59.611 --> 43:02.612
we got bigger things
to worry about.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.282
- What could possibly
be worse than this?

43:06.284 --> 43:09.285
- That's what I
intend to find out.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.333
- You're wasting your time.

43:23.335 --> 43:26.069
You won't find anything.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.670
- Whoever it is
that's messing with us

43:27.672 --> 43:31.140
must have a way in,
a door or a basement.

43:32.310 --> 43:34.877
Something we haven't seen yet.

43:35.914 --> 43:37.814
You gonna be okay here?

43:37.816 --> 43:40.049
- Oh, I think I'll manage.

43:47.292 --> 43:48.992
- If you hear or see anything,

43:48.994 --> 43:50.727
call me immediately.

43:51.529 --> 43:53.930
- Hey, be careful out there.

45:00.565 --> 45:02.231
Oh, that's not good.

45:03.702 --> 45:07.036
- Jonathan,
where are you?

45:28.359 --> 45:31.594
Jonathan.

45:33.531 --> 45:35.198
- What is it, Jack?

45:36.334 --> 45:37.567
- What the hell are
you doing up there?

45:37.569 --> 45:41.170
I've been trying to
get ahold of you.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.972
I found the basement.

45:43.842 --> 45:46.075
Just having a look around.

45:46.077 --> 45:49.412
If there's another way
in, this is probably it.

45:49.414 --> 45:52.014
- Look Jack, I need you to
get back up here right now.

45:52.016 --> 45:54.984
I found something
very interesting.

45:54.986 --> 45:55.986
- Jonathan.

45:58.623 --> 46:01.057
Jonathan, you're breaking up.

46:03.528 --> 46:04.528
Jonathan.

46:12.303 --> 46:13.303
- Jack.

47:02.253 --> 47:04.387
Jack, if you can hear me,

47:05.523 --> 47:08.324
get the hell out
of the basement.

48:04.249 --> 48:05.915
- Barnum vindictae.

48:33.544 --> 48:34.544
- Jack?

48:36.814 --> 48:39.081
Jack, I've been
trying to reach you.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.885
There's something very
wrong with this place.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.292
- Is that you, Sarah?

48:49.294 --> 48:50.526
- Who are you?

48:52.363 --> 48:55.998
- What did I tell you about
being late for school?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.667
- What do you want?

49:01.239 --> 49:02.872
- You're not Sarah.

49:20.425 --> 49:23.592
What have you done
with my Sarah?

49:42.847 --> 49:46.248
- There, that should
stop the bleeding.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.183
- Thanks.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.986
- But you might need stitches.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.387
What the hell happened?

49:51.389 --> 49:54.457
- What did you find
in the basement?

49:55.293 --> 49:56.292
- Doesn't matter.

49:56.294 --> 49:58.361
- Of course, it matters.

49:59.397 --> 50:01.464
Jack, what did you find?

50:05.269 --> 50:07.603
- I found a little blood.

50:07.605 --> 50:08.605
- And?

50:09.307 --> 50:10.506
- Next to it, there was a....

50:22.487 --> 50:26.155
- Well, that definitely
wasn't here before.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.633
There's no dial tone.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.982
- What the hell?

50:52.984 --> 50:54.717
That's not possible.

51:06.464 --> 51:07.464
- Hello.

51:12.403 --> 51:13.736
It's your wife.

51:15.039 --> 51:16.039
- What?

51:16.774 --> 51:18.307
- She says she's your wife.

51:18.309 --> 51:20.476
She wants to talk to you.

51:36.761 --> 51:39.995
- Oh, it
hurts so much, Jack.

51:39.997 --> 51:41.597
- Rebecca.

51:41.599 --> 51:44.600
- This
is all your fault.

51:45.736 --> 51:48.404
Why did you let
him do this to me?

51:49.440 --> 51:50.773
- Rebecca.

52:10.495 --> 52:11.495
- Jack?

52:16.567 --> 52:17.567
Hello.

52:33.251 --> 52:34.650
What's going on?

52:36.487 --> 52:38.220
You all right, Jack?

52:42.226 --> 52:45.060
- She's been dead
for five years.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.364
- God, I'm so sorry.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.412
- She was a psychic.

53:07.485 --> 53:09.618
I loved her more than anything.

53:13.157 --> 53:15.391
More than life itself, but

53:17.495 --> 53:21.063
I could never understand
that side of her.

53:22.166 --> 53:25.935
All the Ouija boards,
the totems, tarot cards.

53:29.840 --> 53:30.840
I tried.

53:36.414 --> 53:38.881
One evening at
dinner, she told me

53:38.883 --> 53:42.618
that she made contact
with this evil spirit.

53:47.024 --> 53:49.425
I thought she lost her mind.

53:51.562 --> 53:52.828
I tried to reason with her,

53:52.830 --> 53:55.331
talk some sense into her, but

53:58.169 --> 53:59.668
she was convinced

54:02.206 --> 54:03.272
it was real.

54:10.915 --> 54:14.149
She became obsessed
with those boards.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.487
No matter what I
did to hide them

54:18.489 --> 54:20.122
or get rid of them,

54:22.493 --> 54:26.729
every night, I'd wake up
and I'd find her on them.

54:33.571 --> 54:35.404
As the weeks went on,

54:37.041 --> 54:39.108
she got worse and worse.

54:40.411 --> 54:42.845
She locked herself in her room,

54:42.847 --> 54:44.513
she stopped eating.

54:45.583 --> 54:48.050
She wouldn't talk to anybody.

54:50.588 --> 54:51.887
She was scared.

54:54.458 --> 54:57.593
She was convinced this thing

54:57.595 --> 54:59.595
was trying to kill her.

55:02.667 --> 55:03.667
One night,

55:05.603 --> 55:06.669
I came home,

55:10.341 --> 55:12.408
and she was in the bath.

55:16.047 --> 55:18.380
There was blood everywhere.

55:22.887 --> 55:24.620
She slit her wrists.

55:30.528 --> 55:32.428
Before I could do anything,

55:32.430 --> 55:33.430
she took the knife

55:37.001 --> 55:39.401
and she cut her throat open,

55:40.204 --> 55:42.004
right in front of me.

55:46.410 --> 55:48.143
I couldn't save her.

55:54.151 --> 55:55.151
I tried,

55:56.454 --> 55:57.454
I tried.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.157
I should have.

56:11.068 --> 56:13.469
I couldn't live with myself,

56:15.606 --> 56:16.905
with the guilt.

56:18.342 --> 56:20.576
I took it out on everyone,

56:21.545 --> 56:24.279
clairvoyants, psychics, mediums.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.052
The more frauds I exposed,

56:30.054 --> 56:32.121
the more it fueled my anger

56:32.123 --> 56:33.922
that she'd been duped

56:36.394 --> 56:40.396
or brainwashed by all
that paranormal bullshit.

56:44.835 --> 56:46.068
She was right.

56:53.911 --> 56:54.911
It's real.

57:28.512 --> 57:29.912
You're up early.

57:31.348 --> 57:32.548
- Couldn't sleep.

57:32.550 --> 57:33.550
You?

57:34.685 --> 57:36.585
- I slept pretty good.

57:38.889 --> 57:41.190
So, what is all this stuff?

57:42.293 --> 57:43.826
- What you're looking
at is the history

57:43.828 --> 57:46.862
of Richmond Manor for
the last 200 years.

57:46.864 --> 57:49.298
It turns out that most of
our murder victims were,

57:49.300 --> 57:53.135
unbeknownst to them,
related to the Richmonds.

57:53.137 --> 57:56.572
Back in 1801, there was an
unprovoked massacre here.

57:56.574 --> 57:58.173
No one knows who started it,

57:58.175 --> 57:59.908
but the family scattered.

57:59.910 --> 58:03.212
Since then, something's
been drawing them back here

58:03.214 --> 58:05.514
and murdering them.

58:05.516 --> 58:08.484
I found something else
among the list of names.

58:08.486 --> 58:10.486
A family, the Donavans.

58:13.457 --> 58:14.656
- Holy shit.

58:14.658 --> 58:16.325
- Holy shit indeed, Jack.

58:16.327 --> 58:19.928
Your being here
is no coincidence.

58:19.930 --> 58:21.763
- What about you?

58:21.765 --> 58:24.600
- I've been asking myself
that same question.

58:24.602 --> 58:28.570
My hunch is that it feeds
off psychic powers somehow.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.138
Myself, your wife,

58:32.343 --> 58:34.843
even our hapless friend here.

58:36.213 --> 58:40.482
- That's the symbol I saw in
the basement next to the blood.

58:40.484 --> 58:43.752
- Basement, I've been
seeing it everywhere.

58:43.754 --> 58:44.953
Every time I touch the board,

58:44.955 --> 58:47.623
it's like a feedback
loop in my mind.

58:47.625 --> 58:49.858
Of course, it's a conduit.

58:50.694 --> 58:53.295
That's how it gets around.

58:53.297 --> 58:55.831
That's how it delivered
the cards to us.

58:55.833 --> 58:59.067
That's how it's
drawing its power.

58:59.069 --> 59:02.137
See, it's been weak
so far, but now,

59:02.139 --> 59:04.373
it's taking physical form.

59:05.209 --> 59:06.975
- The question is

59:06.977 --> 59:09.111
can we herd it back?

59:09.113 --> 59:12.014
- There's one way to find out.

59:19.823 --> 59:22.257
How many shells have we got?

59:22.259 --> 59:25.594
- Two in the chamber, one here.

59:25.596 --> 59:27.629
- Let's hope it's enough.

59:27.631 --> 59:28.631
- Yeah.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.387
Son of a bitch.

59:54.391 --> 59:55.490
- What?

59:55.492 --> 59:56.959
- Son of a bitch.

59:58.562 --> 01:00:00.195
- Shit in my mouth.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.699
- How old is this guy?

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.269
Barnum, Barnum, Barnum.

01:00:08.539 --> 01:00:10.172
That's one of the words
I saw in the basement.

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.673
- Words, what words?

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:13.542
- There's some writing
on the wall in Latin.

01:00:13.544 --> 01:00:15.644
It said, "Barnum vindictae."

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:16.845
- Barnum revenge.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.046
- Oblitus.

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:18.880
- Forgotten.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:21.016
- Legitimus fetus.

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:23.518
- Barnum's Richmond's
bastard son.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.754
No wonder he's pissed off.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.255
- What does that all mean?

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:28.824
- It means we're
not getting paid.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:29.791
- I'm serious.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.059
- So am I, Jack.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:33.161
I've got some pretty
big gambling debts.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.130
It's the dice, they call to me.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.365
- Jonathan, focus.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:37.633
Could we use it to hurt him?

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:40.102
- What the words,
the book, the symbol?

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.069
We could try a ritual.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.404
The question is, "Where?"

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:43.639
- The basement.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:44.973
- The basement's the
door he using to leave.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.075
We need to find the
door he used to come in.

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.577
It could be anywhere.

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:50.545
- I think I know where.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:51.547
- Show me.

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.182
- This has to be it.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.118
The reading's are
off the charts.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.320
Trust me, that isn't normal.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.287
- I like it.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.757
We'll perform the ritual here.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.430
No matter what you hear,
no matter what you see,

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:11.867
it's imperative you stay
within the salt circle

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:14.269
till the ritual is complete.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:17.372
- I'm ready.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:18.440
- I hope so.

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:25.847
- So, what now?

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.549
- Now we wait.

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:29.785
This could take some time.

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:35.157
- Oh, that didn't take long.

01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:39.294
What's that?

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:40.362
- Ignore it.

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.166
- It sounds like.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:46.802
- Look, it's a trick, ignore it.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:48.370
- I have to check.

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:54.710
- Really? Hmm?

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:56.445
What did I just say?

01:04:46.817 --> 01:04:49.084
- Jonathan!

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.086
- Jack.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:58.494
Jack.

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:10.472
Jack, where the hell are you?

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:23.818
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jack!

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.020
- We've gotta get out of here.

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:26.755
- No, we have to
complete the ritual.

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:30.959
Oh, that doesn't sound friendly.

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:32.594
- Come on, come on.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.466
This is getting really
messed up, I just saw....

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:39.701
- Look, if we don't
complete that ritual,

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:42.837
we're gonna die in
this house tonight.

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.076
Oh shit, look....
- Use the gun.

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:48.910
- What?

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:49.744
- Shoot her.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:50.578
- I'm not qualified.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.413
- Shoot her!

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:53.249
- Oh!

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.353
- You got her, it worked.

01:05:58.355 --> 01:05:59.354
- Is it dead?

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:00.588
- I don't know.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:01.690
Can you kill something
that's already dead?

01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:03.091
- Oh, it smells.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:06.061
- Stay here and watch it.

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.195
- And do what?

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.797
- If it
moves, kill it again.

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:26.047
- Stop looking at me!

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.167
Fuck you.

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.005
- Look familiar?

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.007
The falls?

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:56.177
- What are you doing?

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.312
- Are you serious?

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:58.680
We've gotta document this.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:00.915
- Have you lost
your fucking mind?

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:03.685
- This
changes everything.

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:07.656
- Oh.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.425
Oh, Jesus.

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:12.660
Jack, he seems a bit big.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.665
Jack, he's, oh, he's big.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.435
It's big, it's big,
it's Big Beard.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:21.437
Come on.

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:24.607
- What?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.643
Go upstairs and
prepare the ritual,

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.245
I'll take care of him.

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:39.482
Oh shit!

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.597
- Oh, come on.

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:15.603
- Why don't you help me, Jack?

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:20.541
You could have
saved me from him.

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.711
But you helped me die.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:39.627
- Fuck, son of a bitch.

01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:09.924
Barnum, you bastard.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:18.166
I call upon you of
spirits of hell.

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:22.303
Appear in my presence before
this circle of SOGOMA.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.816
I am the stag of seven tines.

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:37.752
I am the wide
flood on the plain.

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:40.355
I am the wind on
the deep waters.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:43.291
I am shining tear on the sun.

01:12:43.293 --> 01:12:45.493
I am a hawk on the cliff.

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:48.363
I am fair among the flowers.

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:52.333
I am a god who sets the
world afire with smoke.

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.805
Show yourself, demon.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:10.318
Jack, what the hell
are you playing at?

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:26.100
- Rebecca, is that you?

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:29.070
- It hurts so much, Jack.

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:32.206
The pain never stops.

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:34.542
He won't let it.

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:50.558
Look what you made me do.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:53.429
- No.

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:57.965
- You could've stopped it.

01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.934
You could've helped me.

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:02.404
- Stop.

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:09.143
- Why did you let
him do this to me?

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:12.180
Why did you let me die?

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.182
- Stop it!

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.292
You're not my wife.

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.174
You're not my wife!

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:51.385
- You're wife
tastes sweet, Jack.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:57.926
Very sweet.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.166
- You're not my wife!

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:08.302
No!

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:54.248
- Oh, good of you to join us.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.286
- I had some old
demons to deal with.

01:15:58.288 --> 01:15:59.520
Let's finish this.

01:15:59.522 --> 01:16:01.155
- I'm fine, by the way.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:02.723
Start reading.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.059
- In these names
that are above all others,

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:08.362
whether it constrained by
chains or returned to darkness,

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.666
may you never disturb
this house again.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.369
- Again.

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:17.171
- In these names
that are above all others,

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:20.107
whether it constrained by
chains or returned to darkness,

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:22.677
may you never disturb
this house again.

01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:23.945
- Atat.

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:25.580
- In these names that are above all others.
- Barnum.

01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:27.381
- Whether constrained by chains.
- Bacuth.

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:29.283
- Or returned to darkness.
- Exsilium.

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:29.951
- May you never disturb
this house again.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:31.018
- Vindictae.

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:34.922
Again. Atat.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.391
- In the names are above all others.
- Barnum.

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:39.093
- Whether it constrained by chains....
- Bacuth.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:39.827
- Or returned to darkness.

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:40.995
- Exsilium.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:41.662
- May you never disturb
this house again.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:42.330
- Vindictae.

01:16:42.332 --> 01:16:43.564
Again!

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:45.199
- In the names that are above all others.
- Atat.

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.234
- Whether it constrained by chains.
- Barnum.

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:49.136
- Or returned to darkness.

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:50.471
- May you never disturb this house again.
- Exsilium.

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:51.839
- Vindictae.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:53.107
Atat.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.942

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.544
- Whether it constrained by chains.

01:16:56.546 --> 01:16:58.412
- Or returned to darkness.
- Exsilium.

01:16:58.414 --> 01:16:59.280
- May it never disturb
this house again.

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:06.487
- Vindictae.
You are banished.

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.732
- Is that it?

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.066
- I don't know.

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:25.640
Don't look at it!

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.578
We have to complete the ritual.

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:33.147
- Atat,

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.415
Barnum.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:35.883
Bacuth.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:37.018
Exsilium.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.020
Vindictae.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:41.288
- Don't look at it.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:45.526
- Atat, Barnum,
Bacuth, Exsilium, Vindictae.

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:51.298
Atat, Barnum, Bacuth,
Exsilium, Vindictae.

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:58.205
Atat, Barnum, Bacuth,
Exsilium, Vindictae.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.454
- This can't be right.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.189
It was way too easy.

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:43.918
Oh no, no, no, no.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:53.728
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
Jack, I'm sorry.

01:19:26.596 --> 01:19:27.995
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:13.073
