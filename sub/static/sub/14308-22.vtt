00:08.233 --> 00:10.967
[When the Saints Go Marching In
playing]

00:11.067 --> 00:13.967
- MICHELLE, NOBODY'S
IN THE BAKERY.

00:14.067 --> 00:16.533
DID YOU FORGET TO TURN THE SIGN
AROUND ON THE DOOR AGAIN?

00:16.633 --> 00:18.667
- NO.

00:18.767 --> 00:20.933
NO.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.800
I ADMIT BUSINESS
HAS BEEN A LITTLE SLOW,

00:22.900 --> 00:24.133
BUT THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.700
- HMM.
- I FIGURE IF I MAKE THE BAKERY

00:25.800 --> 00:27.033
A LITTLE MORE NEW ORLEANS-Y,

00:27.133 --> 00:28.633
IT'LL BRING IN
THE TOURISTS, SO...

00:28.733 --> 00:31.333
TA-DA!
- AAGH!

00:31.433 --> 00:33.567
- BEHOLD THE BROWN PELICAN--

00:33.667 --> 00:34.967
LOUISIANA'S STATE BIRD.

00:35.067 --> 00:38.833
IT PRACTICALLY SQUAWKS
THE BIG EASY.

00:38.933 --> 00:42.467
WHERE SHOULD I PUT IT?
- BACK UNDER THE BLANKET.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.367
HEY, LOUIE.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.033
I GOT FREE TIME
IF YOU STILL NEED HELP

00:47.133 --> 00:48.767
PRACTICING
YOUR POSSESSION TECHNIQUE.

00:48.867 --> 00:50.067
- AH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.767
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
WITH FRANKIE.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.367
WE MADE IT A GAME.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.767
- YEAH, LOUIE POSSESSES ME,
AND WE SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES ME

00:55.867 --> 00:57.667
TO FORCE HIM OUT.

00:57.767 --> 01:01.233
- GERONIMO!

01:01.333 --> 01:04.733
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

01:04.833 --> 01:07.733
- REMEMBER WHEN KIDS
PLAYED HIDE

01:07.833 --> 01:09.367
A CUSTOMER.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.100
I KNEW THE FOUNTAIN
WOULD WORK.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.767
WELCOME TO PIE SQUARED.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.833
THAT LITTLE GIRL
IS NOT REACTING TO MY FOOD.

01:17.933 --> 01:20.433
SHE'S JUST WEIRD.

01:20.533 --> 01:23.867
- GET OUT OF ME!

01:26.500 --> 01:27.933
WHERE AM I?

01:28.067 --> 01:30.700
UH-OH.

01:39.867 --> 01:43.567
- SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR TODAY'S SPECIALS?

01:49.267 --> 01:51.933
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

01:52.067 --> 01:54.433
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

01:54.533 --> 01:57.133
- * SO, IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

01:57.233 --> 02:01.167
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:01.267 --> 02:03.400
* DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:03.500 --> 02:05.067
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:05.133 --> 02:07.367
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:07.467 --> 02:10.833
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:10.933 --> 02:12.767
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:12.867 --> 02:16.333
*

02:16.433 --> 02:18.567
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:18.667 --> 02:20.567
*

02:26.500 --> 02:28.300
- HEY, TAY, WANT
TO WHITTLE WOOD?

02:28.400 --> 02:31.700
- I WEALLY, WEALLY WOULDN'T.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.233
SORRY, I CAN'T.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.267
THE GYMNASTICS TEAM IS BUILDING
A FLOAT FOR HOMECOMING.

02:36.367 --> 02:38.733
- SOUNDS FUN.
COUNT ME IN.

02:41.833 --> 02:45.067
- MILES, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE A TEAM-BONDING THING.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.433
INCHWORMS ONLY.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.500
- AH, NO WORRIES.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.233
I'LL JUST SPEND THE DAY
WITH MOPPY.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.600
I MADE HIM
FOR WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.967
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MOPPY?

02:56.067 --> 02:59.067
- I AM SO NOT TALKING TO YOU.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.400
- WE'RE SORT OF HAVING A SPAT.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.567
I LET MICHELLE USE HIM
TO CLEAN THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.400
- IT WILL TAKE MORE
THAN A BOX OF CHOCOLATES

03:07.500 --> 03:12.100
TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS JAM,
MISTER!

03:12.200 --> 03:13.967
- I BETTER GO TALK TO HIM.

03:14.067 --> 03:16.633
DRAMA QUEEN!

03:19.700 --> 03:21.767
- JAMES, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:21.867 --> 03:24.200
- I'M HUNGRY.
MY STOMACH'S GROWLING.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.700
THAT'S MY BODY
GIVING ME A MESSAGE.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.067
- OOH, TOO LATE.

03:28.167 --> 03:31.500
ALL OUR PASTRIES JUST EXPIRED.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.533
OKAY, WELL, OFF YOU GO.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.400
- HEY, IS YOUR COUSIN MILES
EVER GONNA VISIT AGAIN?

03:35.500 --> 03:38.233
HE WAS SO COOL.
NO.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.133
HE RAN AWAY
TO JOIN THE CIRCUS.

03:40.233 --> 03:41.800
HE CLEANS THE MONKEY CAGES.

03:41.900 --> 03:45.567
- I ALWAYS KNEW THAT GUY
WAS DESTINED FOR GREATNESS.

03:45.667 --> 03:48.367
- YES, WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD.
BYE.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.467
- HEY, THAT WAS JAMES.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.667
I SHOULD GO SAY HI.
- MILES, NO.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.067
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.067
JAMES HAS THE ABILITY
TO SEE GHOSTS.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.467
- YEAH, HE ALSO LIKES
WOODWORKING, NINJA MOVIES.

04:00.567 --> 04:02.600
IF HE WORE A BOW TIE,
HE'D BE A TRIPLE THREAT.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.733
- BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW
YOU'RE A GHOST.

04:05.833 --> 04:06.900
- AND HE'LL NEVER KNOW.

04:07.067 --> 04:08.400
REMEMBER LAST TIME
WE HUNG OUT?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.167
- YEAH,
YOU HAD A KARATE MATCH

04:10.267 --> 04:12.067
IN THE LIVING ROOM,
AND I GOT KICKED IN THE HEAD.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.733
- BEST DAY EVER.

04:14.833 --> 04:18.133
- MILES, IF THE PEOPLE AT SCHOOL
FOUND OUT I LIVE WITH GHOSTS,

04:18.233 --> 04:20.733
I'D BE LABELED
THE CLASS WEIRDO.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.667
- FINE.

04:22.767 --> 04:24.800
- THANK YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.567
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.067
I DESERVE BETTER
THAN A STUPID MOP.

04:31.167 --> 04:34.667
DO YOU?

04:38.600 --> 04:41.833
- MOM, LOUIE AND I FEEL BAD
FOR BREAKING YOUR BIRD FOUNTAIN,

04:41.933 --> 04:44.467
SO WE MADE A VIDEO
OF OURSELVES APOLOGIZING.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.133
- AW, THAT'S SWEET.

04:46.233 --> 04:49.667
- BUT THAT WAS BORING,
SO WE MADE A RAP VIDEO INSTEAD.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.733
- OH, THAT'S TYPICAL.
- CHECK IT OUT.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.733
- * WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,
YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY *

04:55.833 --> 04:57.633
* MOM SAYS,
"NO, YOU GOT SCHOOL TODAY" *

04:57.733 --> 04:59.400
* YOU GET ON THE BUS,
YOU LOOK FOR A SEAT *

04:59.500 --> 05:03.067
* THE ONLY ONE'S NEXT TO A GUY
WITH STINKY FEET *

05:03.100 --> 05:05.067
* THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME,
WHAT CAN I SAY? *

05:05.100 --> 05:07.067
* IT'S CRAZY HARD,
CRAZY HARD *

05:07.133 --> 05:08.733
* CRAZY HARD,
CRAZY HARD *

05:08.833 --> 05:11.900
* IT'S CRAZY HARD
BEING A KID TODAY *

05:14.067 --> 05:17.067
- THAT WAS FANTASTIC, FRANKIE.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.133
THANK YOU
FOR INCLUDING ME.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.067
- LOUIE POSSESSED ME
AND DID ALL THE RAPPING,

05:22.100 --> 05:24.467
BUT THE SWEET MOVES
WERE ALL MINE.

05:24.567 --> 05:27.333
- WE POSTED IT ONLINE
AN HOUR AGO

05:27.433 --> 05:31.067
AND ALREADY HAVE
100,000 HITS.

05:31.133 --> 05:33.067
- WHOA.
YOU GUYS HAVE GONE VIRAL.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.567
I LOVE THE HIP-HOP NAME,
"MCFOUIE."

05:35.667 --> 05:37.933
- THAT'S M.C. FOUIE, MICHELLE.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.067
WE'RE NOT PART
OF A HAPPY MEAL.

05:40.133 --> 05:41.500
- OH, MY GOSH.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.133
WHAT IF YOU TWO PERFORMED

05:43.233 --> 05:44.700
AT THE BAKERY THIS WEEKEND?

05:44.800 --> 05:46.667
M.C. FOUIE'S DEBUT
COULD BE THE PERFECT THING

05:46.767 --> 05:48.967
TO BRING IN A YOUNGER,
HIPPER CROWD...

05:49.067 --> 05:50.767
OR ANY CROWD.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.600
- IT WAS FUN
PERFORMING TOGETHER.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.333
- AND WE DO OWE IT
TO OUR LOYAL FANS

05:55.433 --> 05:56.933
WHO'VE TAKEN THIS JOURNEY
WITH US.

05:57.067 --> 06:00.067
- GREAT. AND IF YOU TWO
NEED AN OPENING ACT...

06:00.100 --> 06:02.900
* MY NAME'S MICHELLE,
I'M A PASTRY CHEF *

06:03.067 --> 06:05.867
* MY APPLE STRUDEL
IS THE MOST, MOST DEF *

06:05.967 --> 06:08.500
OUT.

06:11.067 --> 06:13.200
- THAT WAS AWESOME.
- TOTALLY.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.867
BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY START
WORKING ON THE FLOAT SOON.

06:15.967 --> 06:18.800
- SOPHIE, WE GOT THE PAINT OPEN.
LET'S PACE OURSELVES.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.200
WANT A DRINK?
- LEMONADE SOUNDS GOOD.

06:22.633 --> 06:26.500
- TAYLOR, LOOK WHO I RAN INTO!

06:28.100 --> 06:29.967
- NO.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.400
MILES!

06:31.500 --> 06:33.567
- HE LIKES TO NAME
THE FURNITURE,

06:33.667 --> 06:36.067
WHICH REMINDS ME--BYE!

06:36.100 --> 06:38.067
- LET IT GO, SOPHIE.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.067
THERE'S A WATER FOUNTAIN
AT THE GAS STATION.

06:45.067 --> 06:47.133
- CHECK OUT THESE COOL ANIMALS
WE WHITTLED.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.833
MOO.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.633
MILES, YOU PROMISED
YOU'D STAY AWAY FROM JAMES.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.567
- RELAX. WE HUNG OUT ALL DAY,
AND NO ONE FIGURED OUT

06:59.667 --> 07:01.267
I WAS A GHOST...

07:01.367 --> 07:04.267
ALTHOUGH WE DID GET SOME WEIRD
LOOKS ON THE TANDEM BICYCLE.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.800
- THIS HAS TO END NOW.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.233
- NO WAY.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS WHITTLING?

07:09.333 --> 07:11.467
THE MAN'S AN ARTIST.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.633
AND HE'S WAY MORE FUN
THAN MOPPY,

07:13.733 --> 07:15.767
WHO, FACE IT,
IS JUST A MOP.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.833
- AND YOU'RE A MONSTER.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.533
- JAMES, GUESS WHAT.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.167
IN TWO WEEKS,

07:24.267 --> 07:27.967
SILENT NINJA FIVE IS COMING
TO A THEATER NEAR US.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.233
YOU IN?

07:31.967 --> 07:33.967
- YEAH.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

07:34.067 --> 07:35.967
- THE THING IS, I MIGHT
NOT BE HERE IN TWO WEEKS.

07:36.067 --> 07:39.467
MY FAMILY'S MOVING
OUT OF THE COUNTRY...

07:39.567 --> 07:41.567
TO NEW MEXICO.

07:42.833 --> 07:45.067
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING EARLIER?

07:45.100 --> 07:48.167
- I WAS FOCUSED
ON MY SKINNY COW.

07:50.267 --> 07:54.067
- SO YOU KNOW HOW MY PARENTS OWN
A BOWLING ALLEY?

07:54.167 --> 07:57.367
WELL, THE THING IS...

07:57.467 --> 07:59.167
IT'S HAUNTED BY GHOSTS.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.800
OH, JAMES.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.433
DON'T BE SILLY.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GHOSTS.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.167
- I'M TELLING YOU,
I'VE SEEN SOME FREAKY STUFF.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.533
MY PARENTS SAY
IT'S HURTING OUR BUSINESS.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.467
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST THING IS?

08:10.567 --> 08:11.833
HAVING EVERYONE
AT SCHOOL TEASE YOU

08:11.933 --> 08:14.167
AND CALL YOU THE CLASS WEIRDO.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.733
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.533
SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

08:18.633 --> 08:20.233
- THIS ISN'T FAIR.
- NO.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.200
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MOVE.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.467
- I WANT TO MEET THIS GHOST.
I'M GOING TO YOUR BOWLING ALLEY.

08:26.633 --> 08:29.133
GHOSTS CAN BE PRETTY SCARY.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.333
- NOT ALL OF THEM.
SOME ARE SNAPPY DRESSERS

08:31.433 --> 08:33.367
AND REALLY GOOD LISTENERS.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.167
- OFF WE GO.

08:37.633 --> 08:38.833
- IF WE'RE GONNA PERFORM LIVE,

08:38.933 --> 08:40.900
M.C. FOUIE
NEEDS ANOTHER HIT SONG.

08:43.133 --> 08:45.700
- OH, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT A BAKERY-THEMED RAP--

08:45.800 --> 08:47.900
ROLLIN' IN DOUGH.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.267
* THROWING SUGAR,
THROWING FLOUR *

08:50.367 --> 08:51.500
* CINNAMON--

08:51.600 --> 08:55.167
- AND LET'S TAKE THESE AWAY.

08:55.267 --> 08:58.167
YOU LEAVE THE RHYMING TO ME.
I'M JUST GONNA FREESTYLE.

08:58.267 --> 09:01.633
AFTER ALL, I AM THE REASON
WE WENT VIRAL.

09:03.933 --> 09:05.833
I'M THE FACE OF M.C. FOUIE,

09:05.933 --> 09:08.600
NOT TO MENTION,
MY MOVES.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.300
MOVES?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.233
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL THIS?

09:17.300 --> 09:20.367
- I WAS WONDERING WHEN
JOHNNY JEALOUS WOULD SHOW UP.

09:20.467 --> 09:24.067
- MY NAME IS LOUIE, SO I PRESUME
YOU'RE BEING WITTY.

09:24.167 --> 09:25.400
I CAN BE WITTY TOO.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.767
YOU STINK!

09:32.933 --> 09:34.567
I'VE COVERED THE TOWN
IN FLYERS,

09:34.667 --> 09:36.467
POSTERS, AND BOUGHT
HALF A BUS-BENCH AD.

09:36.567 --> 09:39.067
THANK YOU, MARKETING DEGREE.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.500
- THE GIG'S OFF.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.500
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO END
MY DRY SPELL.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.500
I BOUGHT A BUS BENCH!
I'M ALL-IN!

09:45.600 --> 09:49.333
- SORRY, BUT I REFUSE TO WORK
WITH THIS TALENTLESS GOOFBALL.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.133
UM, COULD A TALENTLESS GOOFBALL
DO THIS?

09:54.233 --> 09:58.467
- WHATEVER YOU JUST DID,
I KNOW YOU MESSED IT UP!

10:00.767 --> 10:02.967
- NO, I DIDN'T.

10:04.433 --> 10:07.800
I MEANT TO DO THIS.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.133
- WELL, THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST
TANDEM BIKE RIDE EVER.

10:15.233 --> 10:19.267
- SO, JAMES, WHAT SORT OF STUFF
GOES ON HERE?

10:19.367 --> 10:20.933
'CAUSE THE SCARIEST THING
I'VE SEEN SO FAR

10:21.033 --> 10:22.600
IS THE COST
OF THOSE SHOE RENTALS.

10:25.067 --> 10:27.467
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD, PEOPLE.

10:27.567 --> 10:30.233
- OH, MAN,
LOOK AT THAT.

10:31.533 --> 10:35.400
- WHOA.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.933
- I TOLD YOU GUYS.

10:42.633 --> 10:46.267
AAH!
HE'S BACK!

10:46.367 --> 10:47.767
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.200
- UH, MILES, YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO TALK TO THIS GUY?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.900
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT FRIENDLY.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.333
- I HAVE TO DO THIS
FOR JAMES.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.867
- YO, SLEEPY HOLLOW,

11:00.967 --> 11:04.700
YOU AND I
HAVE A PROBLEM.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.067
DAD?

11:06.167 --> 11:08.633
- HEY, YOU GUYS SEE ME
ROLL THAT STRIKE?

11:08.733 --> 11:11.833
WHOO-HOO!
I'M ON FIRE TONIGHT.

11:18.900 --> 11:21.733
- WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU
WANT TO HAUNT A BOWLING ALLEY?

11:24.667 --> 11:27.100
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS JAMES KID
WAS YOUR FRIEND.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.167
- HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

11:29.267 --> 11:30.567
- HEY!

11:30.667 --> 11:31.767
- YOU'RE IN THE PENALTY BOX

11:31.867 --> 11:35.067
UNTIL I SEE
AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.900
PLUS, DAD, JAMES IS SPECIAL.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.700
HE DOESN'T JUST SEE FLOATING
PINS AND HEADLESS BOWLERS.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.733
HE CAN SEE GHOSTS
ALL THE TIME.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.133
DID HE SEE MY SHIRT?

11:44.233 --> 11:46.267
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
CAN PULL OFF THIS COLOR.

11:46.367 --> 11:47.767
- DAD!

11:47.867 --> 11:50.500
- YOUR HAUNTING IS RUINING
JAMES'S FAMILY BUSINESS.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN
AND MOVING AWAY.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.900
I GUESS I CAN HAUNT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.067
- ALL RIGHT, SO RAY
DOESN'T HAUNT THE ALLEY,

11:57.167 --> 11:59.500
MILES NEVER SEES JAMES AGAIN,
AND EVERYONE'S HAPPY!

11:59.600 --> 12:01.467
WHO'S UP FOR FROYO?

12:01.567 --> 12:03.067
- UH, NOT SO FAST.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.800
FOR JAMES'S PARENTS
TO STOP THE MOVE,

12:04.900 --> 12:07.133
THEY HAVE TO KNOW FOR SURE
THE PLACE IS GHOST-FREE.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.467
- HMM,

12:08.567 --> 12:11.767
WELL, WHAT IF YOU CAME OVER
TO THE ALLEY

12:11.867 --> 12:15.200
AND PRETENDED TO GHOSTBUST ME
OUT OF THERE IN FRONT OF JAMES?

12:15.300 --> 12:16.567
- THAT COULD WORK.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.367
- BUT THEN AFTER THAT,
IT'S OVER.

12:18.467 --> 12:20.700
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE GOSSIPING
ABOUT ME LIKE THEY DO JAMES.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.967
I JUST WANT A NORMAL LIFE.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.567
DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.800
- YOUR LIFE IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.067
- I AGREE.

12:29.667 --> 12:33.067
NOW, HOW ABOUT THAT FROYO?

12:33.133 --> 12:34.700
WHOO-HOO!

12:34.800 --> 12:38.233
- YEAH, PERFECTLY NORMAL.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.433
all:
M.C. FOUIE! M.C. FOUIE!

12:41.533 --> 12:42.833
- YO, YO, YO!

12:42.933 --> 12:45.767
ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE
SAY, "HEY!"

12:47.233 --> 12:48.667
WELCOME ALL.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.167
UH, I KNOW YOU'RE JAZZED
TO SEE M.C. FOUIE,

12:51.267 --> 12:54.333
SO SIT BACK, RELAX,
MAYBE ORDER A LEMON SQUARE.

12:54.433 --> 12:57.133
YOLO, AM I RIGHT?

12:58.267 --> 13:01.733
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.433
FRANKIE, I'VE GOT
A BAKERY FULL OF PEOPLE

13:05.533 --> 13:06.700
DEMANDING M.C. FOUIE.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.367
HAVE YOU MADE UP
WITH LOUIE YET?

13:08.467 --> 13:11.333
- SORRY, I'VE BEEN BUSY
GIVING BIG GERT A FACE TATTOO.

13:11.433 --> 13:14.433
I NEED TO UP HER STREET CRED.

13:14.533 --> 13:16.667
- OH.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.733
WE ARE DISCUSSING THAT LATER.

13:18.833 --> 13:21.400
BUT RIGHT NOW
THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.833
- WHY WOULD I EVER AGREE

13:22.933 --> 13:25.767
TO PERFORM
WITH THAT EGOMANIAC AGAIN?

13:25.867 --> 13:27.100
- BECAUSE...

13:27.200 --> 13:32.200
BECAUSE HE FEELS HORRIBLE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.067
- DEVASTATED...

13:34.133 --> 13:36.433
WHICH IS WHY HE SENT ME
TO TELL YOU HE'S SORRY

13:36.533 --> 13:38.233
AND WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.600
- MM-HMM.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.433
THOSE WERE HIS EXACT WORDS.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.833
AND BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

13:44.933 --> 13:47.700
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE PEOPLE
CAME TO SEE.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.867
- HMM.

13:48.967 --> 13:51.067
I'M GLAD FRANKIE FINALLY
CAME TO HER SENSES

13:51.167 --> 13:52.633
AND APOLOGIZED.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.533
- SHE SAID SHE JUST WANTS
TO PERFORM WITH YOU TONIGHT

13:54.633 --> 13:56.867
AND NEVER
TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.667
SHE STRESSED THE
"NEVER TALKING ABOUT IT" PART.

13:59.767 --> 14:01.167
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

14:01.267 --> 14:04.067
- WELL, IF FRANKIE'S
BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT

14:04.167 --> 14:07.500
I'M THE CREATIVE GENIUS,
WHO AM I TO ARGUE?

14:07.600 --> 14:08.733
- MM!
YEAH, BOY-EE!

14:08.833 --> 14:11.067
M.C. FOUIE IN DA HIZZ-OUSE!

14:11.100 --> 14:14.067
- MICHELLE, DON'T.
JUST DON'T.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.433
- GUYS, I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.067
THIS GHOST
IS PRETTY HARD-CORE.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.767
- YEAH, WELL, SO ARE WE.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.933
- YOU'RE IN CAPABLE HANDS,
MY FRIEND.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.633
OOH, DID I GET YOU?

14:41.133 --> 14:42.733
- THERE HE IS!

14:46.867 --> 14:49.100
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
WITH HIS HEAD ON BEFORE.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.467
HE'S HIDEOUS!

14:50.567 --> 14:52.867
LOOK AT THAT GRUESOME GOATEE!

14:52.967 --> 14:55.900
HOW ABOUT IF
I TAKE THIS BOWLING BALL AND--

14:56.067 --> 14:57.200
- OKAY.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.333
LET'S REMEMBER TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT WHAT WE SAY

14:59.433 --> 15:01.100
IN FRONT OF THE GHOST.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.467
- STAND BACK, JAMES.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.533
IT'S TIME FOR THE PROS
TO TAKE OVER.

15:06.633 --> 15:07.700
- YOU THERE!

15:07.800 --> 15:10.100
- AAH!

15:10.200 --> 15:11.667
- THIS IS MY ALLEY,

15:11.767 --> 15:14.767
AND I WILL ROAM
THESE LANES FOREVER

15:14.867 --> 15:16.733
WITH MY INCREDIBLE HAUNTS

15:16.833 --> 15:20.933
AND MY UNIVERSALLY LIKED
GOATEE!

15:21.067 --> 15:22.267
- SILENCE, GHOST!

15:22.367 --> 15:25.300
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FACIAL HAIR!

15:25.400 --> 15:27.700
- I'LL STOP HIM
WITH MY THING

15:27.800 --> 15:32.067
THAT'S LABELED "LEAF BLOWER"
BUT ISN'T.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.400
- OH, NO!

15:33.500 --> 15:34.733
THIS STEADY BREEZE

15:34.833 --> 15:38.400
IS WEAKENING
MY GHOST POWERS!

15:38.500 --> 15:39.833
- YES, IT'S WORKING!

15:39.933 --> 15:43.400
- OKAY, YOU!
IT'S GAME OVER!

15:43.500 --> 15:46.533
- AAH!
OH, NO!

15:47.800 --> 15:50.633
- YOU DID IT!
THANKS, YOU GUYS!

15:50.733 --> 15:52.233
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS.

15:52.333 --> 15:55.133
NOW THAT THE GHOST IS GONE,
WE CAN STAY IN NEW ORLEANS!

16:01.500 --> 16:02.867
- THE ENERGY BALL.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.767
NICE TOUCH, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

16:04.867 --> 16:07.700
- I GOT TO SAY, AS PHONY
GHOSTBUSTERS, WE'RE NOT BAD.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.133
- NICE WORK, DAD.
JAMES DOESN'T SUSPECT A THING.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.533
- I THINK HE DOES NOW.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.067
- JAMES, WAIT--
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU, MILES.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.500
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND!

16:21.600 --> 16:24.333
AND THEN YOU GET YOUR DAD
TO PRETEND TO BE A GHOST

16:24.433 --> 16:27.067
FOR SOME PRACTICAL JOKE?

16:27.133 --> 16:30.267
WE WHITTLED TOGETHER, MAN.

16:30.367 --> 16:31.300
- JAMES--

16:31.400 --> 16:32.967
I'M GLAD WE'RE MOVING.

16:33.067 --> 16:37.567
WITH FRIENDS LIKE YOU,
WHY WOULD I WANT TO STAY?

16:37.667 --> 16:41.300
all:
M.C. FOUIE! M.C. FOUIE!

16:41.400 --> 16:42.867
- OKAY, HAVE FUN.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.067
AND REMEMBER
THE "NO TALKING" PART.

16:45.133 --> 16:47.667
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.767
- WELL, I'M GLAD
WE FINALLY SEE EYE TO EYE

16:49.867 --> 16:51.433
ON WHO THE REAL TALENT IS.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.467
- YEAH, IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS,
BUT, UH, NO HARD FEELINGS.

16:54.567 --> 16:55.900
- AH, NONE TAKEN.

16:56.067 --> 16:59.267
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
M.C. FOUIE!

17:04.833 --> 17:07.600
- HELLO, NEW ORLEANS!

17:10.333 --> 17:12.500
I'VE GOT A SPECIAL SURPRISE--

17:12.600 --> 17:17.067
A NEW SONG I WROTE
CALLED ROLLIN' IN DOUGH!

17:17.100 --> 17:19.867
- NO, I TOLD YOU
I WASN'T DOING THAT LAME SONG.

17:19.967 --> 17:22.067
- BUT YOU ADMITTED
I WAS THE STAR.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.500
LET ME SHINE, PLEASE.

17:23.600 --> 17:27.433
- I'D NEVER ADMIT THAT,
YOU TALENTLESS WANNABE!

17:27.533 --> 17:30.467
WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT NO TALKING?

17:30.567 --> 17:33.467
ALL-IN!
BUS BENCH!

17:33.567 --> 17:36.567
ONCE AGAIN, M.C. FOUIE.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.833
- THAT'S IT.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.167
I'M FREESTYLING,
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!

17:42.267 --> 17:44.300
AAH!

17:44.400 --> 17:46.467
- I'LL SHOW YOU FREESTYLING.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.367
* NOW, LISTEN, EVERYBODY

17:49.467 --> 17:50.633
* M.C. FRANKIE'S MY NAME

17:50.733 --> 17:52.067
* LOUIE'S JUST A POSER

17:52.100 --> 17:53.433
* AND HE'S REALLY,
REALLY LAME *

17:53.533 --> 17:54.767
* LAME!

17:54.867 --> 17:56.067
all: OH!

17:56.167 --> 17:57.267
- * LAME!

17:57.367 --> 17:58.400
all: OH!

17:58.500 --> 18:00.467
- OH, IT'S ON NOW!

18:00.567 --> 18:02.700
AAH!

18:06.300 --> 18:08.900
- * MY NAME IS FRANKIE,
AND I POOP IN MY PANTS *

18:09.067 --> 18:13.100
* NOW EVERYBODY
DO THE FRANKIE DOO-DOO DANCE *

18:13.200 --> 18:16.500
*

18:16.600 --> 18:18.933
- UH...
* EVERYBODY NOW

18:19.067 --> 18:22.800
* EVERYBODY DO
THE FRANKIE DOO-DOO DANCE *

18:24.167 --> 18:26.500
- HERE COMES THE PAIN.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.133
- QUIT IT, LOUIE.
OH, THAT'S IT.

18:29.233 --> 18:33.067
GET OUT OF ME!

18:33.100 --> 18:35.133
- WAIT, W-WAIT! DON'T GO YET!

18:35.233 --> 18:38.700
Y-YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THE NOTORIOUS M.O.M.!

18:38.800 --> 18:41.867
* MY NAME'S MICHELLE,
AND I'M A PASTRY CHEF *

18:41.967 --> 18:45.667
* MY APPLE STRUDEL
IS THE MOST-- *

18:47.400 --> 18:50.833
THROWING THINGS
IS VERY WACK, PEOPLE.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.900
- HEY, BUDDY.
I BOUGHT YOU SOME WOOD.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.100
YOU WANT TO WHITTLE?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.967
OKAY.

19:01.067 --> 19:04.433
LOOK, MILES, I KNOW IT STINKS,
BUT IT'S FOR THE BEST.

19:04.533 --> 19:07.700
YOU AND JAMES BEING FRIENDS
WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK OUT.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.200
- HELLO, MEAN PEOPLE.
- JAMES!

19:10.300 --> 19:14.633
- YOU DROPPED A PIECE
OF YOUR FAKE GHOSTBUSTING JUNK.

19:14.733 --> 19:18.400
- I WISH I COULD EXPLAIN...

19:18.500 --> 19:19.900
BUT I CAN'T.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.800
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY.
- SAVE IT, TAYLOR.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.767
YOU DON'T GET IT.
YOU MAKE FRIENDS EASILY.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.333
I DON'T.

19:27.433 --> 19:31.067
MY WHOLE LIFE PEOPLE
HAVE THOUGHT I WAS WEIRD, AND...

19:31.133 --> 19:33.067
MAYBE I AM.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.167
BUT I THOUGHT MILES
WAS DIFFERENT.

19:35.267 --> 19:38.300
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.067
- JAMES, WAIT.

19:40.133 --> 19:42.133
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

19:42.233 --> 19:43.433
I HAVE A SECRET TOO.

19:43.533 --> 19:47.067
THE TRUTH IS...

19:47.100 --> 19:49.200
I...

19:49.300 --> 19:51.733
I HAVE 12 TOES.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.567
- THANKS FOR SHARING.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.800
- NO, WAIT.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.600
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS...

19:59.700 --> 20:03.467
I LIVE WITH GO...PHERS.

20:03.567 --> 20:06.033
- BYE, TAYLOR.

20:07.633 --> 20:10.733
- I LIVE WITH GHOSTS!

20:12.067 --> 20:13.833
- UH, NOTHING!

20:13.933 --> 20:15.733
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
SHE WAS JUST--

20:15.833 --> 20:18.233
- MILES IS A GHOST.
- GAH!

20:18.333 --> 20:19.967
- HEY.
- AAH!

20:20.067 --> 20:22.900
- OH, HELLO. UH, YOU DIDN'T SEE
ME WALK THROUGH THAT WALL.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.333
YOU THOUGHT YOU DID,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.000
- AAH!

20:28.100 --> 20:30.200
- HIM TOO.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.900
- JAMES, YOU HAVE A GIFT.
NOT EVERYBODY CAN SEE US.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.667
YOU'RE NOT WEIRD.
YOU'RE UNIQUE.

20:37.767 --> 20:41.000
- THIS IS A LOT TO TAKE IN.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.133
- THE POINT IS, MY DAD WILL
NEVER HAUNT YOUR ALLEY AGAIN,

20:44.233 --> 20:46.133
SO MAYBE YOU CAN STAY?

20:46.233 --> 20:51.200
AND ALSO, MAYBE TRY
AND BE FRIENDS WITH A GHOST?

20:51.300 --> 20:54.033
- HECK, YEAH, BUDDY.
UP TOP.

20:54.133 --> 20:55.467
- OW!

20:55.567 --> 20:59.033
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.833
LISTEN, JAMES, CAN WE TRUST YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING?

21:01.933 --> 21:03.800
- NO.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.167
- THE GHOSTS.

21:06.267 --> 21:09.100
- DON'T WORRY, TAYLOR.
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.067
MILES, WE ON
FOR SILENT NINJA FIVE?

21:12.100 --> 21:13.733
- ABSOLUTELY.

21:15.533 --> 21:18.233
WOW.
THANKS, TAYLOR.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.900
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER DONE FOR ME.

21:21.067 --> 21:23.500
- COULDN'T HAVE YOU LOSE
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.467
- SECOND-BEST FRIEND.

21:25.567 --> 21:28.067
I'M OUT OF THE PENALTY BOX?

21:28.167 --> 21:33.967
- NICE!

21:34.067 --> 21:37.733
YOU'D THINK
I'D KNOW BETTER BY NOW.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.767
