00:33.350 --> 00:34.375
Harder.

00:39.755 --> 00:41.359
Hit her harder, please.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.327
I decide how much pain she gets.

00:44.819 --> 00:46.340
And I decide how much money you get.

00:51.558 --> 00:53.378
Put those away.

00:56.585 --> 00:58.009
Now.

01:29.882 --> 01:30.727
Frank?

01:31.170 --> 01:32.711
I figured you'd call.

01:32.712 --> 01:34.466
Do you know who W.C. Feels was?

01:34.586 --> 01:35.959
The guy who married May West?

01:36.079 --> 01:40.453
No, it was a guy who refused to work with
kids and animals. I'm a fan.

01:40.573 --> 01:42.178
Don't tell me you opened the package.

01:42.179 --> 01:43.399
Ah, I thought about it.

01:43.475 --> 01:44.954
That cute little dog.

01:45.074 --> 01:46.401
So you knew about this all along?

01:47.240 --> 01:49.240
Lighten up Frank, it's easy money.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.372
No such thing as easy money.

02:02.175 --> 02:03.565
Hi baby.

02:05.046 --> 02:10.735
Ah, come here baby. Mommy missed you.
Did you miss mommy my little baby?

02:11.490 --> 02:13.775
Ah, he wants to say goodbye.

02:13.895 --> 02:15.295
Bye bye.

02:16.130 --> 02:17.260
Woof.

02:24.069 --> 02:25.469
Give it to me.

02:25.535 --> 02:28.186
This is my place. We play by my rules.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.848
Look, if she wasn't here--
- What?

02:31.550 --> 02:33.130
What would you do?

02:33.356 --> 02:34.756
Give it to me.

02:38.060 --> 02:40.149
Could one of you hit me please?

02:53.020 --> 03:01.747

03:38.829 --> 03:40.256
Grandfather.

03:44.241 --> 03:48.203
Have you heard anything yet?
- They're moving it today.

03:48.442 --> 03:50.188
It's not just for me you know.

03:50.308 --> 03:54.000
I know grandfather.
It's for all of us.

03:54.927 --> 03:56.504
All of us.

03:58.135 --> 03:59.243
Yes.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.590
Ah! Striking, isn't it?

04:40.710 --> 04:44.695
What would you say if I told you I could
sell that painting tomorrow

04:44.815 --> 04:46.224
for half a million euros.

04:46.515 --> 04:48.384
I'd say you'd have to steal it first.

04:48.504 --> 04:52.130
Speaking hypothetically of course.
- Of course.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.735
The name's Tracy.

04:54.552 --> 04:56.440
This is mister Voros.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.703
Let's, eh, get this over with. The
sooner he makes the delivery--

04:59.823 --> 05:01.378
the sooner I get my money.

05:13.473 --> 05:15.501
Now you be careful with that.

05:16.953 --> 05:19.300
You have no idea how much it's worth.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.165
Take it easy.

08:55.203 --> 08:57.520
The package, in your trunk. Give it to me.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.040
I can't do that.

09:00.538 --> 09:02.821
Give it to me, now!
- Why?

09:03.340 --> 09:05.005
Because it belongs to me.

09:05.025 --> 09:07.151
Put the gun down, I'm just a driver
delivering a package.

09:07.189 --> 09:08.420
Which was stolen from me.

09:09.735 --> 09:13.390
Why should I believe you?
- Because I'm the one holding the gun.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.930
Do you have any idea what
you've got in that car?

09:17.050 --> 09:19.884
It's none of my business.
- Following orders?

09:19.885 --> 09:21.705
Sticking to the deal, actually.

09:21.975 --> 09:23.529
Give it to me.

09:28.399 --> 09:31.056
You should be careful with those
things, they can be dangerous.

10:06.413 --> 10:07.653
You're the driver.

10:08.892 --> 10:10.385
Not what I expected.

10:12.392 --> 10:13.490
Likewise.

10:14.252 --> 10:15.492
Where's the package?

10:21.453 --> 10:22.420
Follow me.

10:31.305 --> 10:32.629
So when's that auction?

10:33.020 --> 10:37.780
The driver has arrived, mister Berber.
- Oh, perfect.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.933
I've been waiting a long time for this.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.185
Finally.

10:53.046 --> 10:54.314
Incredible.

11:00.448 --> 11:03.743
Well, if our business is done--
- Wait a second.

11:05.435 --> 11:08.212
This is something I've been
pursuing for quite some time now.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.375
I need to have my associate here inspect
it.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.910
Just to make sure it wasn't damage through
transport.

11:13.834 --> 11:14.792
Professor.

11:15.318 --> 11:18.736
Yes, yes.
Extra ease of light.

11:19.275 --> 11:21.558
It's magnificent.
- Yes it is.

11:22.648 --> 11:23.267
Wait.

11:27.781 --> 11:30.334
No!
- What is it?

11:32.905 --> 11:36.209
It may be a masterpiece in it's own right,
but it's not the painting you bought.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.250
It's a forgery.

11:39.312 --> 11:42.448
That's impossible. Maybe,
but I doubt I'm wrong.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.500
Fuck!

11:55.332 --> 11:58.832
This is extremely disappointing.
- I just deliver the package.

11:59.129 --> 12:00.810
I'm not responsible for what's inside.

12:01.195 --> 12:03.715
I made a down payment of a million
dollars for this painting.

12:03.735 --> 12:07.251
I'm sure you won't mind the hospitality of
my estate, while I look into this.

12:14.419 --> 12:16.550
Real animal lover, your boss.

12:17.790 --> 12:18.982
Bad news.

12:19.102 --> 12:21.724
The professor's confirmed the painting is
a fake.

12:22.636 --> 12:24.871
Well, like I said, it's got nothing to do
with me.

12:24.991 --> 12:28.597
The man who hired you to make the delivery
says he gave you the real painting.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.944
Of course he did, what else is he gonna say?

12:31.064 --> 12:35.800
So. Someone is lying then. We just have to
find out who.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.596
Since you happen to be here right now--

12:38.716 --> 12:39.836
you go first.

12:39.956 --> 12:42.406
Are you left handed or right handed?

12:42.526 --> 12:47.405
I only ask because it usually saves
time and a hell of a lot of mess--

12:47.409 --> 12:50.809
to go straight for the fingers
of the dominant hand.

12:54.864 --> 12:57.756
Second time today I have a gun pulled on
me.

13:04.473 --> 13:06.434
I need to speak to mister Akimatsu.

13:06.534 --> 13:09.060
Yes I know what time it
is in Tokyo, it's urgent.

13:10.438 --> 13:13.095
I can assure you I'll get to the bottom
of this.

13:26.524 --> 13:28.751
Yes, I am aware of the consequences.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.742
I don't expect any of you idiots
to know anything about art.

13:42.742 --> 13:44.959
So I'm gonna try and explain
this really carefully.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.261
That painting was part of a set.

13:47.381 --> 13:48.945
The same scene done four times.

13:49.535 --> 13:51.845
Each representing one of the four seasons.

13:51.965 --> 13:56.029
Winter, spring, summer and fall.

13:57.813 --> 13:59.276
I own three of them.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.895
Individually, they're each worth about 20
million.

14:03.015 --> 14:04.182
As a set--

14:04.680 --> 14:07.147
They're worth five times that much.

14:08.114 --> 14:12.230
I already have a buyer. Who will be very
disappointed if I don't deliver.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.616
Now what happened?
- Dumb fuck here let the driver take his gun.

14:26.986 --> 14:29.765
I could beat you to death with this poke
right here.

14:31.193 --> 14:33.193
But that would make a mess of the carpet.

14:44.547 --> 14:46.013
Start with that driver.

14:47.439 --> 14:49.374
Find out what he knows. Then kill him.

15:09.313 --> 15:10.153
Frank!

15:10.273 --> 15:15.320
I'm here.
- Ah, devil's rider is coming home? Come in.

15:47.255 --> 15:49.940
Why do I do this work? You ask yourself that.

15:50.602 --> 15:51.905
'Cause it's simple.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.693
Pick something up at point A.
Take it to point B.

15:54.693 --> 15:56.222
End of story, nothing complicated.

15:56.472 --> 15:58.478
You're a man who likes routine, Frank.

15:58.506 --> 15:59.370
Exactly.

16:00.279 --> 16:03.603
So why does it turn to shit?
- You need to stick by rules.

16:06.575 --> 16:07.755
Is the car ready?

16:07.959 --> 16:12.306
Yeah, system check's complete in--
Maybe sixty seconds.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.385
What can I do for you?

16:36.633 --> 16:39.234
The painting was a forgery.
- You opened the package.

16:39.354 --> 16:42.586
Long story. I need you to find out about
that gallery owner. - Tracy?

16:42.706 --> 16:47.965
I need you to run a motorcycle plate.
- All right. Anything else?

16:48.085 --> 16:51.785
Yeah, find me a nice simple delivery for a
change.

16:51.905 --> 16:54.827
Do you ever think about switching jobs?

16:55.450 --> 17:00.605
Only three or four times a day.
- Just imagine how bored you would get, Frank.

17:01.225 --> 17:02.675
Thanks Carla.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.094
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

18:14.430 --> 18:16.090
I've come to talk about the painting.

18:19.795 --> 18:23.235
So, you will come twice a week.

18:23.751 --> 18:25.505
You will pay in cash.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.430
And you will never complain.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.162
No matter what happens.

18:32.345 --> 18:36.928
I don't want anything too rough.
- I'll decide about that.

18:37.048 --> 18:38.731
And no marks.

18:40.805 --> 18:44.165
I don't want my wife asking questions.

18:44.285 --> 18:45.999
You're a naughty boy.

18:48.037 --> 18:51.750
I'm just here to have a little fun.
Nothing dangerous.

18:52.111 --> 18:53.435
You put those away.

18:53.632 --> 18:58.125
You know what? You business man are all
the same.

18:58.245 --> 19:04.420
Big men on the outside. Frightened little
boys on the inside.

19:14.655 --> 19:18.847
I have a job for you.
- I'm sorry. Madame Cora is not available.

19:18.967 --> 19:20.680
Don't Madame Cora me, it's work time.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.511
She's with a client right now, I have her call
when she's done.

19:24.631 --> 19:28.079
Cut the crap. You work for me full-time, I own you
so get over here.

19:29.505 --> 19:31.130
Where do you thing you're going?

19:31.655 --> 19:33.131
I have business to attend to.

19:34.230 --> 19:36.522
Right now, it's play time.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.180
I'm just here for light whipping.

19:42.647 --> 19:43.783
In a while.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.823
Get out. Before you get hurt.

20:01.370 --> 20:04.675
I already told Gyver. I don't--

20:05.920 --> 20:08.040
I don't know anything about the painting.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.864
Talk to the broker. His name is Tracy.

20:11.984 --> 20:14.017
If anyone knows anything about this--

20:14.046 --> 20:17.065
Oh we're gonna talk to him, don't worry
about that.

20:17.185 --> 20:19.195
But here's the thing, mister Voros.

20:19.315 --> 20:21.669
We need to find out who
has the real painting.

20:21.669 --> 20:25.869
And we're finding it very hard to believe
that you don't know anything about it.

20:25.940 --> 20:28.264
I want you to think long.

20:29.050 --> 20:30.874
And hard.

20:31.201 --> 20:33.107
I-- don't know!

20:33.227 --> 20:37.505
You know what you need?
A little more incentive. So tell me--

20:38.915 --> 20:42.483
Are you left handed or right handed?

20:44.505 --> 20:46.130
What are you doing. No!

20:48.835 --> 20:50.645
Noooooo.

20:55.037 --> 20:56.680
You shouldn't break into people's houses.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.933
You shouldn't chase cars on a motorcycle.

20:59.340 --> 21:02.270
I know a few people who can ride like that.
You're not exactly that type.

21:02.900 --> 21:03.960
Oh yeah?

21:04.350 --> 21:05.750
What type am I?

21:06.130 --> 21:09.300
Nice Jewish girl. From an American suburb.

21:09.830 --> 21:10.820
The pictures--

21:11.770 --> 21:14.131
One with you and the older gentlemen. In
the suit.

21:15.782 --> 21:16.787
My grandfather.

21:18.980 --> 21:20.000
The Pissaro.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.280
it was a fake.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.396
My buyer's expert barely looked at it. He
had no doubt.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.363
When you see the real thing, you know
right away.

21:29.010 --> 21:30.915
There's an essence that no forger ever
captures.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.820
But you thought I had the real one.

21:33.142 --> 21:34.983
I heard that the original was in Berlin.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.710
And Kiber wants it and Charles Tracy
offered it to him.

21:39.971 --> 21:41.501
I'm sorry about the frying pan.

21:43.090 --> 21:44.600
I just want what's mine.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.088
What makes you more deserving than anyone
else?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.180
Family photos?

21:59.420 --> 22:02.600
This was eh-- my great great grandmother.

22:02.989 --> 22:07.860
See that? - What am I looking at?
- On the wall behind her.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.220
A Pissaro.

22:11.340 --> 22:14.030
This was taken at their house in Warsaw
mid 1930s.

22:14.150 --> 22:15.440
So?

22:15.740 --> 22:18.624
My great grandmother again. With her
father.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.800
See the guy with the beard?

22:25.190 --> 22:27.400
My grandfather's great grandfather.

22:28.230 --> 22:29.510
Camille Pisarro?

22:33.454 --> 22:36.019
The rest is-- birth certificates.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.100
Other stuff.
- So what happened?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.695
Ubergruffenführer Paul Hauser.

22:47.262 --> 22:48.830
It's bounced around since the war.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.757
And you just have to get this old family
painting back?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.099
I made a promise to someone.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.579
Do you know where Voros stays
when he comes to Berlin?

23:05.274 --> 23:06.702
Why should I tell you?

23:06.902 --> 23:09.611
If you want to see the painting
again, I'm your best chance.

23:10.721 --> 23:14.027
Let's say I have a professional interest
in getting to the bottom of this.

23:14.157 --> 23:17.185
I think you have a target on your back.
- Odds are so do you.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.983
I figure you've been investigating
this for some time.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.054
Poking around, asking questions.

23:23.745 --> 23:25.035
They're gonna find out.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.555
Voros uses an apartment in Dalham.

23:28.114 --> 23:30.935
It actually belongs to one of his father's
companies.

23:33.003 --> 23:33.792
Let's go.

23:37.695 --> 23:40.156
Ehm, hang on. I just wanna get my jacket.

23:56.257 --> 23:57.581
Get you hands off me!

24:03.167 --> 24:04.387
Let go of me!

24:11.149 --> 24:13.298
It's his phone.
- Hey, come on!

24:15.130 --> 24:16.160
Gorn, it's Kiber.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.100
Where's my painting?

24:19.501 --> 24:21.025
Your painting.

24:21.045 --> 24:22.724
Hey, you listen to me, you son of a bitch.

24:22.744 --> 24:25.844
You listen to me, that painting is mine. I
don't give a fuck where it came from.

24:25.864 --> 24:29.353
I'm gonna find it and if you get in my way
I'm gonna fucking kill you, understand?

24:32.170 --> 24:35.231
Like I said, we both got targets on our
back.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.432
Yes?

24:54.552 --> 24:56.511
Now listen to me, you idiot.
Go find that girl.

24:56.855 --> 24:59.338
If you don't find her you get a
visit from Madame Cora, clear?

24:59.630 --> 25:00.938
All right.

25:08.865 --> 25:11.023
Maybe you should wait here.
- No chance.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.171
It's the guy from the art gallery.

25:33.187 --> 25:35.121
That's not a good sign.
- Oh God!

25:35.241 --> 25:36.327
His fingers are missing.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.013
Means he stuck to his story right
to the end, he was telling the truth.

25:39.013 --> 25:40.544
He had nothing to do with this.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.669
You gonna be OK?
-Yeah.

25:42.669 --> 25:44.089
I need a minute, gonna look around.

25:53.890 --> 25:58.950
Thought he was dead.
- Think I'll take that, for just a little while.

25:59.589 --> 26:01.565
We better get out of here.

26:04.880 --> 26:05.922
Now what?

26:08.570 --> 26:10.286
We still have the forgery.

26:13.246 --> 26:14.166
Why did you keep it?

26:14.954 --> 26:16.247
It's not paint by numbers.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.680
There are only so many people around
capable of doing something like that.

26:20.085 --> 26:22.066
We find the forger, he'll lead us to the
original.

26:23.938 --> 26:25.910
I have a friend who knows about these
things.

26:26.030 --> 26:28.958
His name is Ivan. I'll give him a call.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.313
Gorn found the driver.

26:35.433 --> 26:37.227
He was with the girl at her apartment.

26:38.937 --> 26:41.437
And then they lost him. Again.

26:43.927 --> 26:45.786
You keep disappointing me, Vera.

26:46.331 --> 26:49.899
I got a lead on the broker Tracy. He owns
a gallery, called the Culture Factory.

26:50.019 --> 26:52.236
There's going to be some sort of event
there tonight.

26:52.999 --> 26:55.271
I love a good art show.

26:58.107 --> 26:59.014
Hello?

26:59.015 --> 27:02.163
Hi, Ivan. I have a painting I need
authenticated.

27:02.283 --> 27:03.139
Eh.

27:03.477 --> 27:05.383
Bring it to the gallery, I'll take a look.

27:06.369 --> 27:09.144
All right, we'll see you soon, thanks.

27:10.176 --> 27:13.679
He's working at an opening tonight. We're
gonna meet him there.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.181
How long have you been doing this kind of
work?

27:37.619 --> 27:39.019
A while.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.480
No wife? No family?

27:44.585 --> 27:46.388
I like to keep things simple.

27:46.508 --> 27:48.003
Sounds kind of lonely.

27:50.535 --> 27:53.953
You didn't track that painting to Voros
with a simple internet search.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.970
I wish. Three years of my life spent--

27:57.090 --> 27:58.735
in dusty archives all over Europe.

27:59.017 --> 28:02.989
When I started this I told myself this was
for my grandfather.

28:04.111 --> 28:07.632
Sometimes I wonder why I don't just walk
away. - Why don't you?

28:09.685 --> 28:12.793
Maybe it's because I've been doing it so
long I don't know anything else.

28:13.188 --> 28:15.939
You know what I mean?
- I get the idea.

28:23.471 --> 28:26.233
It's an installation. It's called Force of
an Angel.

28:27.970 --> 28:31.622
Naturally.
- Eh, not exactly your kind of crowd, I'm guessing?

28:32.649 --> 28:35.334
I'll see if I can find Ivan.
Try and stay out of trouble.

28:54.153 --> 28:58.195
Composition achieves a very powerful
visual counterpoint, doesn't it?

28:58.315 --> 29:02.726
Although I must admit, usually I prefer
the early Russian stew of abstraction.

29:04.370 --> 29:06.362
When I was 9 I had my first--

29:06.482 --> 29:11.619
erection to a Kandinsky.
- In that case I'll leave you to it.

29:21.110 --> 29:22.315
What's with her?

29:23.015 --> 29:25.664
Later. Come with me.

29:28.165 --> 29:29.982
Frank, this is Ivan.

29:31.869 --> 29:34.114
Come in back. Show me what you've got.

29:41.140 --> 29:44.248
Go in. Get Tracy. Bring him to the car.

29:47.644 --> 29:50.161
We'll wait behind the building.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.360
You found it.

30:08.168 --> 30:12.553
This is piece a vo. It's called a trade
beside the lake in winter. -Is it?

30:12.769 --> 30:15.630
You think it's a fake?
- That's what I was told.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.424
This painting has been missing for almost
70 years.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.372
Saying for the sake of argument--

30:26.492 --> 30:29.070
the artist who the original's copied from, who
could've done it?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.250
Not many people.

30:33.436 --> 30:35.041
This is first class work.

30:35.415 --> 30:39.010
If I had to venture a guess, I'd say--
Markov.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.700
Anton Markov.

30:41.890 --> 30:43.374
He's the best there is.

30:43.374 --> 30:46.250
He's crazy as a loon, but if anyone
could pull this off it would be him.

30:46.263 --> 30:49.260
How would we find him?
- Oh he's a recluse, but--

30:50.255 --> 30:51.905
I could ask around if you want.

30:52.910 --> 30:54.911
The main event. Please.

32:07.506 --> 32:11.027
Who's that guy?
- It's Tracy. My boss.

32:11.271 --> 32:12.154
Hey!

33:08.194 --> 33:10.700
Going somewhere? Let's go.

33:10.820 --> 33:11.940
Come.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.911
Good call.
- Why don't you shut your face.

33:25.031 --> 33:26.817
Okay, okay.
- Get in there.

33:27.181 --> 33:28.980
Get down.
- Watch the hair!

33:53.144 --> 33:55.245
That enough dissidant cannibal for you?

34:03.825 --> 34:05.007
They got Tracy.

34:05.264 --> 34:06.519
The police are on their way.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.940
You don't want them to find you here.
You better get going.

34:08.955 --> 34:10.516
Do you know where your boss lives?

34:10.516 --> 34:14.016
He's staying at his girlfriend.
- Give me an address.

34:18.355 --> 34:22.318
Please. You have to listen to me. I don't
have anything to do with this.

34:22.862 --> 34:24.688
Mister Voros said otherwise.

34:24.809 --> 34:26.641
All I did for him, was eh--

34:26.641 --> 34:28.010
I just advised him--

34:28.010 --> 34:31.186
that if he wanted to sell his painting
I could get him a good price for it.

34:31.266 --> 34:32.563
And that transporter--

34:32.683 --> 34:35.399
was my idea. You know, I could've
delivered the painting myself.

34:35.518 --> 34:38.436
Shut up!
I'll deal with the transporter later.

34:38.530 --> 34:41.322
Right now there's only one thing I need to
know.

34:42.005 --> 34:43.844
Where's the original?
- I don't know.

34:45.949 --> 34:47.040
Very well then.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.790
Lara.

34:53.603 --> 34:55.965
Are you left handed or right?

35:09.918 --> 35:11.852
Girlfriend's home. We can use that.

35:11.972 --> 35:15.509
Hey. Before we go in there, I just wanna
say something.

35:15.510 --> 35:18.914
Whatever happens in there, I just want you
to know that I--

35:19.034 --> 35:20.509
What?

35:28.095 --> 35:29.828
We'll continue this later.

35:30.776 --> 35:31.550
It won't work.

35:32.205 --> 35:35.510
What?
- Your gun, that you just slipped from my pocket.

35:35.630 --> 35:36.935
I removed the clip.

35:39.827 --> 35:40.888
Shit.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.406
I'm going in there.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.059
You just gonna walk up and knock on the
door?

35:57.793 --> 35:59.182
So how are we gonna do this?

35:59.511 --> 36:02.114
You've been attacked.
- What?

36:12.947 --> 36:15.747
Help me! Help me!
- What the fuck?!

36:21.885 --> 36:23.265
Help me please!

36:23.385 --> 36:26.967
You've got to help me, there's a guy that--
Thank you!

36:31.040 --> 36:32.373
You can wait right here.

36:36.597 --> 36:40.405
We gotta make this fast. I'll check the
basement.

37:12.850 --> 37:16.054
Where is it?
- It's in the basement.

37:16.828 --> 37:18.496
Get it.

37:59.165 --> 38:00.190
I prefer--

38:01.391 --> 38:03.344
to fight someone my own size.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.744
Is this as good for you as it is for me?

38:30.308 --> 38:31.575
Too much foreplay.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.186
Fire!
- Never mind about that, where's my painting?

38:35.306 --> 38:37.139
It's over there, but--
- Get it!

38:37.259 --> 38:39.612
Don't you move.
- Shut up! Get the painting.

38:39.632 --> 38:41.637
The second you hand it over
he'll kill you and us.

38:41.637 --> 38:43.669
- Shut up, I'll kill this bitch right now.

38:54.206 --> 38:55.934
My painting!
- It's too late.

38:56.054 --> 38:57.117
- My painting!

38:58.114 --> 39:00.730
Get off of me.
- You've got to go!

39:06.550 --> 39:07.630
Please.

39:07.750 --> 39:11.144
There's at least fifty million dollars
worth of art down here.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.076
Oh shit.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.648
Call the fire department.

39:38.648 --> 39:42.148
Tell them you need a place
to stay tonight. Come on!

39:45.937 --> 39:48.537
Lara? I can't move.

39:51.538 --> 39:52.627
Lara, help me!

39:53.810 --> 39:55.000
I can't breathe.

39:57.367 --> 39:58.343
My legs.

40:02.755 --> 40:04.088
Lara, help me!

40:23.325 --> 40:27.560
Bonjour, leave your message.
- Juliet De Bois. This is the transporter.

40:28.225 --> 40:33.403
I have information for you, regarding the
death of Max Kiber. Call me back.

40:34.090 --> 40:35.443
And you owe me one.

40:38.055 --> 40:39.970
I can't believe the painting's gone.

40:42.221 --> 40:46.128
I mean-- after all this time I really
thought I would get it back.

40:47.770 --> 40:49.200
Hey, we got out alive.

40:52.735 --> 40:55.941
Would it make a difference if the painting
wasn't destroyed.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.559
What are you talking about?

41:00.625 --> 41:02.049
I switched them.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.502
Is that the real thing?
- It is.

41:30.622 --> 41:31.647
May I have a look?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.321
You know, last night--

41:39.321 --> 41:43.433
 I had expected you to throw me out of the
car and keep the painting for yourself.

41:43.525 --> 41:45.112
You don't know me very well.

41:47.912 --> 41:49.687
- Maybe that's something we can work on.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.747
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

41:52.846 --> 41:53.860
- Another job?

41:53.980 --> 41:55.690
Brussels.

41:55.810 --> 41:57.502
I know a great waffle place.

41:57.622 --> 41:58.272
Guys.

41:59.305 --> 42:00.084
It's authentic.

42:07.314 --> 42:10.609
Babe, wanna party?
- With you?

42:10.945 --> 42:12.115
You up for it?

42:14.265 --> 42:17.445
You by yourself?
- Not if you'll go with me.

42:17.565 --> 42:19.708
You want to meet my little friend?

42:39.712 --> 42:42.107
Every one of those assholes had it coming.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.997
That waffle place in Brussels.

43:07.955 --> 43:09.110
Maybe I'll see you there.

43:09.518 --> 43:10.287
Maybe.

43:14.412 --> 43:15.745
Thank you.

43:55.204 --> 43:56.800
Grandfather.

44:08.868 --> 44:10.127
You found it.

44:17.432 --> 44:19.310
Now we are all home.

44:23.902 --> 44:25.545
Thank you.
