01:01.214 --> 01:02.423
Come to gloat?

01:02.448 --> 01:03.689
Hoping to talk to your lawyer.

01:03.714 --> 01:05.648
- Already here.
- Your lawyer's hot.

01:05.675 --> 01:07.310
- Too bad she hates you.
- I've got an offer.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.388
- Plea deal?
- Thank you for coming.

01:09.413 --> 01:12.381
Today, our city begins
a new era of justice,

01:12.415 --> 01:13.758
marked by the formation

01:13.783 --> 01:16.842
of my Citywide
Conviction Integrity Unit.

01:16.867 --> 01:18.375
This revolutionary group

01:18.391 --> 01:20.725
will reach across the five
boroughs, serving as...

01:20.750 --> 01:22.827
The fox guarding the henhouse.

01:23.335 --> 01:24.671
The D.A.'s Office put those people away

01:24.696 --> 01:25.693
in the first place, but now...

01:25.718 --> 01:27.647
These elite lawyers, investigators,

01:27.672 --> 01:30.154
and forensic specialists will
examine claims of innocence

01:30.179 --> 01:31.946
made by incarcerated individuals.

01:31.971 --> 01:33.085
In the wake of...

01:33.110 --> 01:34.759
Couple of big, embarrassing settlements

01:34.784 --> 01:36.453
on busted guilty verdicts.

01:36.478 --> 01:38.219
But, hey, why not turn it around, use...

01:38.254 --> 01:40.255
My position as District Attorney,

01:40.289 --> 01:42.233
part of my job is to secure convictions.

01:42.258 --> 01:44.425
But the true mission
of my office is justice.

01:44.460 --> 01:45.727
This isn't about justice.

01:45.761 --> 01:47.495
This is about selling yourself

01:47.529 --> 01:51.366
as caring, passionate, electable.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.734
There is no peace for the victim

01:52.768 --> 01:54.535
when the wrong person is incarcerated.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.571
If a mistake has been
made, we must correct it,

01:56.605 --> 01:58.606
no matter what embarrassment may arise.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.375
By going back into old cases?

02:00.409 --> 02:02.577
That's guaranteed to piss
off every cop, prosecutor,

02:02.611 --> 02:04.078
and judge, while you hide behind...

02:04.113 --> 02:05.113
The leader of this unit

02:05.147 --> 02:07.515
needs a tenacious and
brilliant legal mind...

02:07.549 --> 02:09.883
I heard your university
board has you on probation.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.253
Something about sleeping with a student.

02:12.288 --> 02:14.121
...an unwavering
commitment to the truth.

02:14.146 --> 02:15.156
Students.

02:15.190 --> 02:16.891
Ironically, it took a nationwide search

02:16.926 --> 02:19.227
to find someone I've
known for a long time.

02:19.261 --> 02:20.728
We all have.

02:22.564 --> 02:24.198
Bye, Wallace.

02:24.233 --> 02:26.768
I want to soak up the "Orange
is the New Black" vibe...

02:26.802 --> 02:29.237
maybe have a little ménage à moi.

02:29.271 --> 02:30.772
This could crush your
mom's poll numbers,

02:30.806 --> 02:31.973
cost her the Senate race,

02:32.007 --> 02:35.109
and put you at the center of
another Morrison family crisis.

02:39.315 --> 02:40.882
Or I can make it all go away.

02:40.916 --> 02:43.117
This individual graduated

02:43.152 --> 02:44.919
first in her law-school
class at Harvard,

02:44.954 --> 02:47.722
won 95% of her cases
as a defense attorney

02:47.756 --> 02:49.490
before going on to teach law

02:49.525 --> 02:51.459
at one of our nation's top universities.

02:51.493 --> 02:54.796
She is also our country's
former first daughter.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.631
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:56.665 --> 02:59.667
the director the new Citywide
Conviction Integrity Unit...

02:59.702 --> 03:01.269
Hayes Morrison.

03:03.672 --> 03:06.307
Hey, over here! Ms. Morrison!

www.addic7ed.com

03:27.436 --> 03:28.736
You get five days.

03:28.761 --> 03:29.761
For each case?

03:29.786 --> 03:31.192
Budget's small, workload's huge.

03:31.217 --> 03:32.721
That's as much time as we can afford.

03:32.756 --> 03:34.331
- You've got a team.
- Of people I pick.

03:34.356 --> 03:35.558
Sorry, they're already hired.

03:35.592 --> 03:37.593
By whomever you originally
promised this gig to?

03:37.627 --> 03:39.795
One of my top ADAs... Sam Spencer.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.597
Submit your recommendation
by week's end...

03:41.631 --> 03:43.232
advise the conviction be reversed,

03:43.266 --> 03:44.900
let it stand, or suggest a retrial.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.302
I pick the cases.

03:46.336 --> 03:47.603
Fine.

03:47.637 --> 03:50.172
But on this first one,
give me a happy ending.

03:51.508 --> 03:53.275
Your team is waiting.

04:03.787 --> 04:06.789
Hayes Morrison? Sam Spencer.

04:06.823 --> 04:09.325
Wallace's golden boy. I took your job.

04:09.359 --> 04:11.293
Yes, you did.

04:11.328 --> 04:13.364
Sorry about that.

04:13.597 --> 04:15.498
I actually am sorry about it.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.368
This is Tess Larson and Franklin Cruz.

04:19.402 --> 04:21.504
Tess, our paralegal, comes to
us from the Innocence Project.

04:21.538 --> 04:23.339
Ms. Morrison, I'm a huge fan.

04:23.373 --> 04:26.075
I worshiped you growing up.

04:26.109 --> 04:27.962
When Senator McCale said
those mean things about you...

04:27.987 --> 04:30.212
When he called me the campus
bike? He wasn't far off.

04:30.247 --> 04:33.215
You look familiar. Have we met?

04:33.250 --> 04:34.717
Oh, no.

04:34.751 --> 04:35.751
I-I would remember.

04:35.786 --> 04:38.821
Hey, call me Frankie. I'm
in charge of forensics.

04:38.855 --> 04:41.657
Nice shirt, Frankie...
very first day of school.

04:41.691 --> 04:43.192
Thanks?

04:43.226 --> 04:45.861
I did not vote for your father.

04:45.896 --> 04:47.663
Me neither.

04:47.697 --> 04:49.231
Hayes Morrison.

04:51.268 --> 04:54.236
Maxine Bohen... lead investigator.

04:54.271 --> 04:55.704
Plans for the first case?

04:55.739 --> 04:57.173
I assumed you'd want to select it.

04:57.207 --> 04:58.407
Think of me as a figurehead.

04:59.576 --> 05:01.510
Seriously, take the helm.

05:01.545 --> 05:03.612
Ah, been considering two options...

05:03.647 --> 05:04.747
Jeremy Baln, convicted for

05:04.781 --> 05:07.383
the 1993 rape and
murder of Sharon Lewis.

05:07.417 --> 05:09.885
Eyewitness I.D.'d Baln,
but police records suggest

05:09.920 --> 05:12.188
he was actually in lockup in
a local precinct for burglary

05:12.222 --> 05:13.155
at the time of the murder.

05:13.190 --> 05:15.624
Eyewitness testimony
is extremely unreliable.

05:15.659 --> 05:18.127
It's involved in over 70%
of overturned convictions.

05:18.161 --> 05:20.696
Second case... Judith
Addison, sentenced to 35 years

05:20.730 --> 05:23.432
for the kidnapping and murder
of 7-year-old Ricky Clark.

05:23.466 --> 05:25.401
Addison, whose functional IQ is 78,

05:25.435 --> 05:27.303
confessed to the cops
after she was held overnight

05:27.337 --> 05:28.137
without an attorney.

05:28.171 --> 05:30.206
We're not touching either of them.

05:31.174 --> 05:34.109
You want to exonerate a guy
whose alibi was another crime

05:34.144 --> 05:36.612
or sell that someone confessed
to a murder they didn't commit?

05:36.646 --> 05:38.147
What happened to "think
of me as a figurehead"?

05:38.181 --> 05:39.782
That was before I realized
you might be a moron.

05:39.816 --> 05:41.217
Best way to pop our cherry

05:41.251 --> 05:42.918
is to get a good guy out of prison...

05:42.953 --> 05:44.420
give Wallace his happy ending.

05:44.454 --> 05:45.921
So, Odell Dwyer,

05:45.956 --> 05:47.423
eight years into a life sentence

05:47.457 --> 05:49.458
for offing his girlfriend, Anna Ramos,

05:49.492 --> 05:51.227
with a bullet to the back of the head.

05:51.261 --> 05:53.796
Minimal physical evidence
against him, but no DNA.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.297
Odell just turned 25,

05:55.332 --> 05:56.632
has no other criminal record,

05:56.666 --> 05:58.767
and he looks like this.

06:00.470 --> 06:01.837
That matters?

06:01.872 --> 06:04.206
Unless his release is
broadcast only on radio.

06:04.241 --> 06:07.610
Conveniently, Odell's
jury was all white.

06:07.644 --> 06:09.495
Seems like the prosecutor
put his thumb on the scale.

06:09.546 --> 06:11.447
- Why is that a good thing?
- Best way to establish

06:11.481 --> 06:13.015
we're not the fox
guarding the henhouse...

06:13.049 --> 06:14.350
beat the crap out of another fox.

06:14.384 --> 06:15.462
Makes Wallace look committed.

06:15.487 --> 06:16.786
Are you gonna go through
this political nonsense

06:16.820 --> 06:19.054
- over every case?
- No.

06:19.089 --> 06:22.358
A win now while everyone's
watching means freedom later.

06:22.392 --> 06:24.493
Most importantly,
freedom for me to consult

06:24.528 --> 06:27.363
from a beach in Hawaii while
you guys tackle hard cases.

06:27.397 --> 06:30.533
That's a good strategy.
Which ADA prosecuted Odell?

06:30.567 --> 06:32.301
Victor Bonotto.

06:32.335 --> 06:33.736
He's a good guy, decent lawyer.

06:33.770 --> 06:35.141
I'll talk to him about the jury.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.373
The only thing that matters
to me is, did he do it?

06:37.407 --> 06:39.542
Go talk to Odell and
take Frankie with you.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.478
- Why?
- Is there a forensics issue?

06:42.512 --> 06:43.817
Something with the evidence?

06:43.842 --> 06:45.214
Odell's in prison.

06:45.248 --> 06:46.808
You've been in prison. Could be useful.

06:49.252 --> 06:52.521
Your new shirt doesn't cover
all of your old prison tattoo.

06:59.396 --> 07:00.696
Great meeting you guys.

07:20.217 --> 07:22.852
My mom and I have
written over 150 letters,

07:22.886 --> 07:25.521
trying to get someone to
take another look at my case.

07:25.555 --> 07:29.124
You two joining the team,
it... it means a lot.

07:29.159 --> 07:30.679
- Sure thing.
- We're not on your team.

07:31.661 --> 07:33.629
The CIU isn't the Innocence Project.

07:33.663 --> 07:35.431
We're not committed to exonerating you.

07:35.465 --> 07:37.900
Then why are you here?

07:37.934 --> 07:39.902
To look at both sides of the case,

07:39.936 --> 07:42.771
see if your conviction has merit.

07:42.806 --> 07:45.774
Then I apologize for
contradicting you, ma'am,

07:45.809 --> 07:47.710
but you are on my team.

07:47.744 --> 07:49.778
I didn't kill Anna.

07:49.813 --> 07:51.247
I loved her.

07:51.281 --> 07:52.448
That's the truth.

07:52.482 --> 07:55.484
Walk me through what you
did on the day she died.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.153
I went to school, got home at 3:10,

07:58.188 --> 08:00.322
and went back for warm-ups at 5:30.

08:00.357 --> 08:01.357
Did you see anybody

08:01.391 --> 08:03.559
or even talk to anybody
on the phone in between?

08:03.593 --> 08:05.794
Uh, usually Anna and I
would hang out before,

08:05.829 --> 08:08.163
but the recruiter from Boston
College was coming that day,

08:08.198 --> 08:10.132
and Anna didn't want to distract me.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.601
We were supposed to meet up after.

08:13.870 --> 08:17.473
Played the game of my life that night.

08:17.507 --> 08:21.310
When she wasn't there
at the end, I knew...

08:21.344 --> 08:23.646
that something was wrong.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.282
You should be eligible for parole.

08:26.316 --> 08:28.751
No, I don't go before the board anymore.

08:31.187 --> 08:33.322
What's the first question they ask you?

08:33.356 --> 08:34.857
"Do you regret your crime?"

08:34.890 --> 08:37.659
And I won't say that I regret
something that I didn't do.

08:39.195 --> 08:40.529
I can't walk out of
here with people thinking

08:40.563 --> 08:43.465
that I killed the girl
I loved... still love.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
Good for you, man.

08:45.702 --> 08:50.306
I feel like life is slipping
through my fingers in here.

08:52.309 --> 08:53.409
You got to get me out.

08:56.246 --> 08:58.981
Did your attorney canvass
your neighborhood or...

08:59.015 --> 09:00.716
I mean, maybe somebody
saw you through the window.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.519
No, but this is something
that he didn't take seriously.

09:03.553 --> 09:05.621
The park where Anna got killed...

09:05.655 --> 09:07.723
it's 100 miles round trip.

09:07.757 --> 09:10.459
There's no way that I
could have been there,

09:10.493 --> 09:11.894
and then made it back for the game

09:11.928 --> 09:13.762
in 2 hours and 20 minutes.

09:16.866 --> 09:19.301
Odell, where'd you get
those scars on your chest?

09:19.336 --> 09:21.170
Oh, I had some acne.

09:22.238 --> 09:23.583
We should go.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.884
The Odell Dwyer jury selection
was totally by the book.

09:35.919 --> 09:38.330
Only three African-Americans
in the pool,

09:38.355 --> 09:39.440
judge removed one

09:39.465 --> 09:41.294
who'd witnessed a co-worker being shot,

09:41.319 --> 09:42.691
another for anti-police bias.

09:42.726 --> 09:44.760
- The third?
- Had a kid Odell's age.

09:44.794 --> 09:46.662
Didn't want to risk her
identifying with him.

09:46.696 --> 09:48.397
- Used a preempt.
- Mm.

09:48.431 --> 09:50.566
You didn't preempt Keith Johnson.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.502
He had a 17-year-old child,
as well, but he was white.

09:53.536 --> 09:54.803
Are you reading my notes?

09:54.838 --> 09:57.373
White jurors are more likely
to incarcerate black defendants.

09:57.407 --> 09:58.407
Tess.

09:58.441 --> 10:00.609
ADA Bonotto knows the
stats on jury diversity.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.578
We all do.

10:02.612 --> 10:04.046
Any doubts about this one?

10:04.080 --> 10:05.280
The kid had no alibi.

10:05.315 --> 10:07.850
The girl wrote in her journal
that she was scared of him.

10:07.884 --> 10:09.752
An eyewitness and physical evidence

10:09.786 --> 10:11.787
tie Odell to the crime scene.

10:11.821 --> 10:14.757
We all had cases that
keep us up at night,

10:14.791 --> 10:16.625
but this wasn't one of them.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.805
You need to get me out of this job.

10:18.830 --> 10:21.130
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Someone just broke into my apartment.

10:21.164 --> 10:24.299
Talk to Wallace,
talk to Mom, I don't care.

10:24.334 --> 10:25.968
Talk to anyone. I cannot do it.

10:26.002 --> 10:27.102
Why is this even a crime?

10:27.137 --> 10:29.772
Anytime you want to say
something, that'd be great.

10:31.808 --> 10:33.776
I'm sorry, but you're
stuck. I can't help you.

10:33.810 --> 10:35.611
Wallace has you for
the next three years.

10:35.645 --> 10:37.413
- Oh, God.
- But I love you.

10:37.447 --> 10:38.947
- You're a lousy brother.
- The worst.

10:38.982 --> 10:41.450
But you're gonna be great at this job.

10:41.484 --> 10:43.752
It requires cage-rattling,
disregard for authority,

10:43.787 --> 10:45.721
and legal brilliance.

10:45.755 --> 10:48.457
What about Mom? How mad is she?

10:48.491 --> 10:51.427
Just wear whatever dress she
wants you to to her fundraiser.

10:55.498 --> 10:57.399
I'd appreciate an explanation.

10:57.434 --> 11:00.002
Sam, Hayes Morrison is
lighting in a bottle.

11:00.036 --> 11:01.637
A brilliant lawyer who also brings in

11:01.671 --> 11:02.938
valuable publicity to the unit.

11:02.972 --> 11:04.633
Don't make it personal.

11:05.829 --> 11:08.227
I left Gangs to run CIU.

11:08.547 --> 11:09.978
Now you need to make that up to me,

11:10.013 --> 11:11.938
or I'll go private
sector... triple my salary.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.918
Pushy and ambitious.

11:15.952 --> 11:18.487
Look, I'm gonna need people like you

11:18.521 --> 11:20.489
on my team when I run
for mayor next cycle.

11:20.523 --> 11:23.492
Right now, I want you
to keep an eye on Hayes.

11:23.526 --> 11:26.795
Your loyalty will be rewarded.

11:41.377 --> 11:43.846
No signs of misconduct by the
prosecution in jury selection.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.380
Doesn't mean Odell's guilty.

11:45.415 --> 11:46.648
Just 'cause you bonded with the guy.

11:46.683 --> 11:50.085
Let's focus. We've got four more
boxes of materials to review.

11:52.856 --> 11:54.790
We just spent the last
two hours going in circles.

11:54.824 --> 11:57.359
Somebody needs to lead this team.

11:57.393 --> 11:58.494
Knock yourself out.

11:59.729 --> 12:03.966
I spent 20 years with NYPD...
15 of those as a detective.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.003
So I know that this is
an NYPD arrest number.

12:09.172 --> 12:11.073
I called a friend. They said the arrest,

12:11.107 --> 12:13.709
which took place last night
at the Downtown Precinct,

12:13.743 --> 12:15.711
has mysteriously vanished.

12:15.745 --> 12:17.579
But this hasn't.

12:17.614 --> 12:19.815
I wonder what else I can find out.

12:19.849 --> 12:23.051
Go be the boss, Boss.

12:35.431 --> 12:36.999
Excited to hear what you've got.

12:39.736 --> 12:41.770
First, funny story...

12:41.804 --> 12:44.540
last night, I was busted
for cocaine possession.

12:44.574 --> 12:47.910
Wallace dropped the charges in
exchange for me taking this job.

12:47.944 --> 12:49.912
Working these pointless
cases with you people...

12:49.946 --> 12:51.547
that's my prison

12:51.581 --> 12:53.849
minus the freedom to go braless

12:53.883 --> 12:55.918
and finally read "Infinite Jest."

12:55.952 --> 12:59.087
So, if this isn't
slam-dunk jury tampering,

12:59.122 --> 13:00.756
then let's pass on Odell's case.

13:00.790 --> 13:04.193
Prison is full of
good-looking black poster boys.

13:09.098 --> 13:10.098
Can I help you?

13:10.133 --> 13:12.534
My name is June Dwyer.

13:12.569 --> 13:16.138
That good-looking black
poster boy, Odell Dwyer,

13:16.172 --> 13:17.439
he's my son.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.471
If you drop Odell's case,.

13:31.505 --> 13:34.274
I'll go to the press about everything,

13:34.308 --> 13:35.648
including your coke bust.

13:35.673 --> 13:37.811
If you prefer, I can take
over the investigation.

13:37.845 --> 13:39.479
Thank you,

13:39.513 --> 13:41.247
but she's got the juice around here.

13:41.282 --> 13:43.516
Over eight years,

13:43.551 --> 13:46.686
that place has been sucking
the life out of Odell.

13:46.721 --> 13:49.355
I would hate for your mother to learn...

13:49.390 --> 13:51.658
You want me to promise
your son will be exonerated.

13:51.692 --> 13:53.159
I can't.

13:53.194 --> 13:54.627
But we will stay on the case.

13:57.865 --> 13:59.966
That will have to do.

14:03.537 --> 14:06.673
Nice move, trying to take
control of the investigation.

14:06.707 --> 14:09.509
You might not be a moron after all.

14:09.543 --> 14:12.512
Unless you decide to spy on
me like Wallace asked you to,

14:12.546 --> 14:15.955
probably in exchange for a key
role in his political future.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.032
He did n...

14:17.057 --> 14:18.685
Every good politician plays that card.

14:18.719 --> 14:20.833
My father used it constantly.

14:20.858 --> 14:22.942
He wasn't loyal to
anyone, not even my mother.

14:23.557 --> 14:25.692
Stabbing me in the back makes sense,

14:25.726 --> 14:27.361
but do it for yourself, not Wallace.

14:31.486 --> 14:34.377
According to her journal,
she said she was pretty scared of you.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.370
Nah, no way. What
does she got to be scared of?

14:37.404 --> 14:39.672
What about the day she died?
Huh? You fight that day?

14:39.707 --> 14:41.708
I told you, I didn't see Anna.

14:41.742 --> 14:42.876
I find that very hard to believe

14:42.910 --> 14:44.110
because according to
her mother, she said...

14:44.145 --> 14:46.713
I told you a bunch of
times, I didn't see Anna!

14:47.581 --> 14:48.815
He's angry,

14:48.849 --> 14:51.251
maybe because he's being accused
of a murder he didn't commit.

14:51.285 --> 14:53.686
Maybe he went ballistic on
Anna like he did with the cops.

14:53.721 --> 14:55.388
Odell had no history of violence.

14:55.422 --> 14:56.990
Yes, but he has acne scars on his chest,

14:57.024 --> 14:59.692
which is a very common side
effect of anabolic steroids.

14:59.727 --> 15:02.262
Odell didn't tear
through the opposing team

15:02.296 --> 15:03.563
fueled by his love of Anna.

15:03.597 --> 15:05.932
He was pumped up on rage-inducing drugs.

15:05.966 --> 15:09.269
Anna did write that she was
scared of Odell several times.

15:09.303 --> 15:11.504
Put "steroids" up for the prosecution.

15:11.539 --> 15:13.573
I'll add a question mark.

15:13.607 --> 15:16.509
Put them in my office. I'll pick
one for the fundraiser later.

15:16.544 --> 15:19.579
Anyone inform the victim's
mother that we're on this case?

15:19.613 --> 15:21.381
Let's avoid another drop-in disaster.

15:21.415 --> 15:23.616
I've left messages
for Lupe Ramos at home

15:23.651 --> 15:24.884
and the salon where she works.

15:27.424 --> 15:29.722
Your mother insisted that I
stay while you try these on.

15:29.757 --> 15:32.416
This fundraiser tomorrow is
very important for her campaign.

15:32.526 --> 15:34.494
What have we got?

15:34.528 --> 15:36.262
Uh... eyewitness was Burt Chambers

15:36.297 --> 15:38.598
who lived on the outskirts
of Pelham Bay Park.

15:38.632 --> 15:39.833
That's where Anna was shot.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.067
Whoa. Uh...

15:43.755 --> 15:45.161
Like you didn't see the paparazzi shots

15:45.186 --> 15:46.661
of me on that nude beach in Belize.

15:48.161 --> 15:51.619
Chambers reported seeing a
black man driving a tan car

15:51.814 --> 15:54.180
quickly out of the
park at around 4:00 p.m.

15:54.205 --> 15:55.357
Was Chambers white?

15:55.382 --> 15:58.086
Cross-racial I.D.s are
especially problematic.

15:58.111 --> 15:59.853
I look like Joe Pesci in this.

15:59.887 --> 16:01.187
You need to speak to Chambers.

16:01.222 --> 16:02.390
Well, Chambers is dead.

16:02.398 --> 16:03.841
But his statement isn't the only thing

16:03.866 --> 16:05.279
that puts Odell at the crime scene.

16:05.304 --> 16:08.136
Anna's body was found near
several Maritime beech trees.

16:08.170 --> 16:10.405
Leaf fragments from those
trees were found in Odell's car.

16:10.439 --> 16:12.440
But Odell insisted he hadn't
been to the park in months.

16:12.474 --> 16:14.642
This color makes me
look like I have HPV.

16:14.677 --> 16:18.312
As far as an alibi,
Odell might not need one.

16:18.837 --> 16:22.015
Round-trip from his house in Staten
Island to the park in the Bronx

16:22.040 --> 16:23.992
and then back to his
school is over 90 miles.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.985
He wouldn't have made it
back in time for warm-ups.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.887
Tess, take Frankie, try the route.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.055
Speak to Odell's defense
attorney, make sure he did his job.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.390
Well, their case consisted mostly

16:31.424 --> 16:32.591
of what the prosecution didn't have.

16:32.626 --> 16:33.659
I mean, motive was hazy.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.528
There's no history of
violence, no murder weapon.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.496
The .45-caliber gun that
shot Anna was never found.

16:37.531 --> 16:38.564
Yes, but if Odell was on steroids

16:38.598 --> 16:40.599
at the time of the murder,
that explains motive.

16:40.634 --> 16:42.568
It makes his history irrelevant.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.336
The gun is the only missing piece.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.841
That's beautiful.

16:50.911 --> 16:52.678
This one was your mother's favorite.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.414
Well, I guess this is the one, then.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.350
Okay, people, show's
over. Let's get to work...

16:58.385 --> 17:00.025
while I attend to some
important business.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.307
Hello, miss.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.608
Your color?

17:27.314 --> 17:28.948
You're Lupe Ramos?

17:28.982 --> 17:31.483
Yes, miss.

17:32.461 --> 17:35.445
The photo is of your daughter, Anna.

17:35.856 --> 17:37.156
She was murdered.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.559
Who are you?

17:40.594 --> 17:41.927
I'm Hayes Morrison.

17:41.962 --> 17:44.463
I'm here now with the
District Attorney's Office.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.333
Oh, you left message.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.834
I...

17:48.859 --> 17:50.364
My English not good.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.799
No.

18:44.991 --> 18:49.828
I... I'm so sorry for your loss.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.497
I...

18:53.166 --> 18:54.700
For your time.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.530
Hello.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.065
I understand you're
interested in this minivan.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.033
Anabolic steroids, actually.

19:28.068 --> 19:29.501
According to my friends in Vice,

19:29.536 --> 19:30.903
you used to sell to the
jocks at Thayer High,

19:30.937 --> 19:32.604
specifically...

19:32.639 --> 19:34.840
I'm not in that line of work anymore.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.842
Will you tell me about the nav system?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.878
Well, it is a fully-integrated GPS...

19:39.913 --> 19:40.946
His name's Odell Dwyer.

19:40.981 --> 19:43.424
He would have bought from
you in the fall of 2008.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.252
- What about the horsepower?
- Well...

19:45.277 --> 19:46.891
Look, the sooner we talk,

19:46.916 --> 19:48.557
the sooner you get back to selling cars.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.862
Odell bought a few
rounds off me that fall.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.065
Last time I saw him was a couple
weeks before he got arrested.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.569
But he wasn't looking for drugs.

20:04.104 --> 20:05.938
Odell was on steroids

20:05.972 --> 20:08.240
and he tried to
buy a gun from his dealer.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.576
It's not looking so good for poster boy.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.944
Or Wallace's happy ending.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.098
Anna's body was found back here.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.935
Come on. The timer's running.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.038
Okay.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.107
Anna ran that way.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.883
Then she went right, and
then left right there.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.694
Keep going.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.728
Right there.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.563
She tripped,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.398
fell...

21:08.935 --> 21:11.170
...and lost her shoe.

21:11.204 --> 21:13.072
She made it past that tree.

21:32.993 --> 21:34.593
Bam!

21:34.627 --> 21:35.894
You're dead.

21:41.935 --> 21:43.769
Odell was wrong.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.805
He had over an hour to
get back for warm-ups.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.875
I guess we know why his defense
attorney never talked about this.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.051
I really wanted this to work.

22:00.483 --> 22:02.788
I hate this job.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.490
Fire me.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.091
Let me guess.

22:06.126 --> 22:08.994
Rough day, someone had
feelings, which you hate...

22:09.029 --> 22:10.863
I will screw it up. Fire me.

22:14.538 --> 22:15.833
That can't be here.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.637
Remember, up close, fun,
wild, and transgressive

22:18.671 --> 22:22.107
is actually messy,
destructive, and dangerous.

22:22.142 --> 22:24.733
This unit could do... good.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.827
I won't. I can't.

22:27.342 --> 22:29.581
- Fire me.
- No.

22:36.671 --> 22:37.990
What about now?

22:54.861 --> 22:56.572
That's not cocaine.

22:57.278 --> 22:58.750
Antihistamine.

23:00.454 --> 23:01.880
The cops still have my blow.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.915
Go do your damn job.

23:32.756 --> 23:35.058
You know what's also a happy ending?

23:35.092 --> 23:37.753
The system worked...
bad guy gets his due.

23:37.778 --> 23:40.455
Wallace looks fair but firm
because we prove Odell Dwyer

23:40.480 --> 23:42.314
is a murderer who belongs behind bars.

23:42.348 --> 23:43.682
So, that's it?

23:43.716 --> 23:45.684
Pull a total 180, bury the guy?

23:45.718 --> 23:47.252
As deep as we can,

23:47.287 --> 23:49.321
which means kicking the tires hard

23:49.355 --> 23:51.356
on every element of
the prosecution's case,

23:51.391 --> 23:52.478
for you guys, at least.

23:52.503 --> 23:53.579
I have to get ready for this fundraiser.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.328
We should at least ask
why Odell wanted the gun.

23:56.362 --> 23:58.664
First thing to check,
Tess' favorite tune...

23:58.698 --> 24:01.300
The eyewitness... A challenge
since he passed away.

24:01.334 --> 24:03.268
Detective Jim
McNally took the statement.

24:03.303 --> 24:05.103
He trained under my
dad. I'll talk to him.

24:05.138 --> 24:06.505
- Take Tess with you.
- Why?

24:06.539 --> 24:08.140
How many friends do you
have that aren't cops?

24:08.174 --> 24:09.608
Several.

24:09.642 --> 24:12.110
Take Tess. See if the
eyewitness was solid.

24:12.145 --> 24:13.812
Since we're kicking tires,

24:13.846 --> 24:17.182
only two leaf fragments
were found in Odell's car.

24:17.217 --> 24:19.184
After Tess and I drove
back from the scene,

24:19.219 --> 24:20.787
leaves were all over
the inside of her ride.

24:20.812 --> 24:22.280
So Odell brushed them off.

24:22.305 --> 24:24.189
Or maybe the cops planted them.

24:24.224 --> 24:25.677
You have zero justification...

24:25.702 --> 24:27.505
Boss said verify the prosecution's case.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.923
Is that what you were doing?
'Cause it seems like to me...

24:28.948 --> 24:30.173
What? Like I care

24:30.198 --> 24:33.131
about leaving a possibly
innocent man to rot in prison?

24:33.369 --> 24:34.978
That place...

24:35.835 --> 24:37.669
Guys don't come out the
same as they went in.

24:37.704 --> 24:39.137
Stop taking this personally.

24:39.172 --> 24:41.206
How about you start taking it that way?!

24:41.241 --> 24:42.895
You haven't even laid eyes on the guy!

24:44.047 --> 24:45.662
Too busy acting like an entitled brat,

24:45.687 --> 24:46.779
more worried about Mommy's party...

24:46.804 --> 24:49.039
Take a walk, Frankie!

24:56.189 --> 24:58.390
Mistakes are way more
likely than conspiracies.

24:58.424 --> 25:01.093
Check out the lab that
processed the leaf evidence.

25:01.127 --> 25:03.061
Tinker Bell, a moment.

25:14.407 --> 25:16.675
I know who you are.

25:16.709 --> 25:18.710
You seen him since he got out?

25:20.813 --> 25:24.082
Seek absolution on your own time.

25:26.282 --> 25:28.253
Yeah, well, my life
is in a shoe box right now.

25:28.288 --> 25:29.688
Most of my stuff is still in the house.

25:29.722 --> 25:32.391
Leah's been real
understanding about that.

25:32.425 --> 25:34.126
Divorce brings out
the jerk in everybody.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.695
We have a few questions
for you about Burt Chambers,

25:36.729 --> 25:39.197
the eyewitness in the Odell Dwyer case.

25:39.232 --> 25:41.400
Oh, yeah. The guy was rock-solid.

25:41.434 --> 25:43.769
Then why didn't you take
a full statement from him

25:43.803 --> 25:45.404
until September 7th?

25:45.438 --> 25:48.140
Chambers came forward at
the scene four days earlier.

25:48.174 --> 25:49.474
We took an official statement

25:49.509 --> 25:51.443
after the forensics results came in.

25:51.477 --> 25:52.811
Anna's time of death was right around

25:52.845 --> 25:54.279
when Chambers spotted a black male

25:54.314 --> 25:55.414
matching Odell's description

25:55.448 --> 25:56.715
driving away from the scene.

25:56.749 --> 25:59.284
Well, it would be a real big help
if we could see your case notes.

25:59.319 --> 26:01.486
The witness's description
of the suspect didn't change.

26:01.521 --> 26:03.655
- I'm on your side.
- Doesn't feel that way.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.557
Feels like I'm being
grilled by the enemy.

26:05.591 --> 26:07.893
The enemy? I took this gig
because now more than ever,

26:07.927 --> 26:09.761
good cops need someone
looking out for them.

26:13.266 --> 26:15.801
Any notes I took would be
in the prosecution's file.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.135
There's nothing there.

26:17.170 --> 26:18.303
Sorry.

26:18.338 --> 26:20.739
I wish I could be more helpful.

26:46.999 --> 26:49.534
Nice tux. Rental?

26:49.569 --> 26:52.504
Wanted to support your
mother's Senate campaign.

26:52.538 --> 26:54.606
Join me.

27:05.485 --> 27:07.352
I'd forgotten what a
good dancer you are.

27:07.387 --> 27:09.821
I haven't forgotten
kicking your ass in court.

27:09.856 --> 27:11.356
We had an even record.

27:11.391 --> 27:13.725
Only if you count
a mistrial as a victory.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.961
- You didn't win.
- Neither did you.

27:15.995 --> 27:18.797
That's us. Couple of losers.

27:18.831 --> 27:20.999
Ever wonder what might've happened

27:21.033 --> 27:22.567
if you hadn't left Chicago?

27:22.602 --> 27:24.503
No.

27:25.238 --> 27:28.707
Aren't you two a lovely couple?

27:28.741 --> 27:31.676
Such a beautiful dress.

27:31.711 --> 27:34.546
May I steal my daughter
for just a moment?

27:34.580 --> 27:35.914
Of course.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.858
Just because Wallace came to our rescue

27:46.893 --> 27:48.593
doesn't mean you have to sleep with him.

27:48.628 --> 27:50.495
I'm not.

27:52.765 --> 27:54.766
"Our rescue"?

27:54.801 --> 27:58.236
The other night, after I
learned of your predicament,

27:58.271 --> 27:59.871
I phoned Wallace.

27:59.906 --> 28:01.773
We worked out a deal.

28:01.808 --> 28:03.446
Thanks for consulting me.

28:03.587 --> 28:05.454
I saved you again.

28:05.479 --> 28:07.398
You saved your poll numbers.

28:07.423 --> 28:09.093
I kept you out of prison.

28:09.118 --> 28:10.717
For possession as a first offense?

28:13.186 --> 28:15.153
Screw up this job,

28:15.188 --> 28:16.355
and Wallace will charge

28:16.389 --> 28:18.657
possession with intent to distribute.

28:18.691 --> 28:21.293
You will go to prison.

28:22.462 --> 28:25.263
An ultimatum.

28:25.298 --> 28:26.665
How familiar.

28:26.699 --> 28:30.502
This time, your father agrees with me.

28:30.536 --> 28:33.638
This is your last chance.

28:33.673 --> 28:36.775
Tough talk in the middle
of a Senate campaign.

28:36.809 --> 28:39.778
That's what talk shows are for.

28:39.812 --> 28:43.515
Oprah has been dying to have me on.

28:43.549 --> 28:45.183
I'd play it for sympathy.

28:45.218 --> 28:47.619
Discuss my shortcomings as a mother,

28:47.653 --> 28:50.789
and I'm aware I wouldn't be lying.

28:50.823 --> 28:52.891
I would talk about how

28:52.925 --> 28:55.293
you had a harder time than your brother

28:55.328 --> 28:56.895
growing up in the public eye.

28:56.929 --> 28:59.531
How you would say that
instead of a childhood,

28:59.565 --> 29:01.800
you had a series of photo-ops.

29:01.834 --> 29:03.802
And how loving your children

29:03.836 --> 29:08.540
sometimes means making tough choices.

29:08.574 --> 29:11.676
I do love you, Hayes.

29:11.711 --> 29:18.383
You are so smart and brave and amazing

29:18.418 --> 29:21.820
and have every opportunity in the world.

29:21.854 --> 29:25.857
Imagine what you could do
if you actually tried...

29:25.892 --> 29:28.560
if you worked at
anything as hard as you do

29:28.594 --> 29:33.031
at making us all believe
how little you care.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.453
The question is,

29:36.859 --> 29:38.370
do you have it in you?

29:41.407 --> 29:43.487
I, for one, would like to know.

30:04.464 --> 30:05.647
I'm here to see Odell Dwyer.

30:15.996 --> 30:17.676
This is crazy.

30:18.271 --> 30:20.845
Hayes Morrison here to
see me a-and looking...

30:20.870 --> 30:23.575
You tried to buy a gun...
There's the murder weapon.

30:23.609 --> 30:25.410
You were on steroids... There's motive.

30:26.712 --> 30:28.613
Don't lie to me. I'm immune.

30:28.648 --> 30:30.682
Childhood over-exposure.

30:32.051 --> 30:33.752
I didn't kill Anna.

30:33.786 --> 30:35.153
Then why'd you want the gun?

30:36.856 --> 30:41.319
I was 17 and stupid and...

30:42.128 --> 30:44.029
I thought it'd be cool to have a gun.

30:45.998 --> 30:47.838
Well, that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

30:49.468 --> 30:50.969
Yeah.

30:52.872 --> 30:54.506
Why was Anna afraid of you?

30:54.540 --> 30:56.208
She wasn't.

30:56.242 --> 30:58.043
Well, she wrote it in her journal.

30:58.077 --> 31:01.847
"He got so mad it scared
me. He won't leave me alone."

31:01.881 --> 31:03.114
She wasn't writing that about me.

31:03.149 --> 31:04.649
- So who was it then?
- I have no idea.

31:04.684 --> 31:07.919
- Well, that's a crappy answer.
- It wasn't me!

31:11.390 --> 31:13.525
The steroids...

31:13.559 --> 31:15.861
I was trying to give
myself a better chance

31:15.895 --> 31:18.230
at a football scholarship.

31:18.264 --> 31:20.332
- It was a mistake.
- You made a lot of those.

31:20.366 --> 31:23.134
Doesn't everyone?

31:23.169 --> 31:25.003
Didn't you?

31:28.507 --> 31:30.508
Look, I just need a chance.

31:34.013 --> 31:36.481
And you're that chance.

31:46.525 --> 31:48.393
I spent the evening with
my dad chewing me out

31:48.427 --> 31:50.495
for hassling Jim McNally.

31:50.529 --> 31:52.397
Said he was one of the best
cadets he ever trained...

31:52.431 --> 31:54.399
gave him five stars.

31:54.433 --> 31:56.534
My dad is a stickler for organization.

31:56.569 --> 31:57.802
Five stars means

31:57.837 --> 32:01.006
McNally took notes at that first
meeting with Odell's eyewitness,

32:01.040 --> 32:03.341
but his street files are not
in the prosecution's document.

32:03.376 --> 32:05.243
So those notes must undermine
the case against Odell.

32:05.278 --> 32:06.244
We need to get ahold of them.

32:06.279 --> 32:08.947
Well, McNally's going
through a nasty divorce.

32:08.981 --> 32:11.082
He mentioned most of his
stuff is still at the house,

32:11.117 --> 32:13.084
which probably includes the case files.

32:13.119 --> 32:14.419
I'll go see the ex-wife tomorrow.

32:14.453 --> 32:16.154
She's probably home now.

32:18.557 --> 32:21.059
If they're getting
a divorce, why is he here?

32:21.093 --> 32:23.261
What are you doing, Jim?

32:23.296 --> 32:26.097
Uh, just getting some
stuff out of the attic.

32:26.132 --> 32:27.565
Leah's been nagging me, so, you know...

32:27.600 --> 32:29.968
This sudden urge have
anything to with the questions

32:30.002 --> 32:31.703
I was asking you about
your street files?

32:31.737 --> 32:34.406
Eh, it's a total coincidence.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.274
We can get a warrant for
the contents of those boxes,

32:36.309 --> 32:37.642
unless you want to hand them over now.

32:37.677 --> 32:39.978
Why would I do that?

32:40.012 --> 32:43.281
Um... I'll let you touch these.

32:45.017 --> 32:47.085
It's worked before.

32:47.119 --> 32:49.554
Jim, look, I get it.

32:49.588 --> 32:51.723
The witness makes an initial statement

32:51.757 --> 32:54.125
and you start liking
Odell for the crime.

32:54.160 --> 32:57.662
You go back, you help the
witness remember some things,

32:57.697 --> 32:59.664
maybe tweak a few details.

32:59.699 --> 33:03.668
Imagine someone going through
your old cases, Maxine.

33:03.703 --> 33:04.970
I'm calling for a warrant.

33:05.004 --> 33:07.238
We both know they'd find some dirt.

33:07.273 --> 33:09.997
I need to speak with Judge...

33:10.022 --> 33:11.064
Come on.

33:11.177 --> 33:12.973
Jim, do the right thing. Turn over...

33:12.998 --> 33:15.647
I did the right thing
when I put Odell away.

33:15.681 --> 33:18.249
He killed that girl. I know it.

33:18.284 --> 33:20.118
I knew it when he went
nuts during the interview.

33:20.152 --> 33:21.786
I knew it when I read
the girl's journal.

33:21.821 --> 33:24.089
I knew it when I talked to her mom.

33:24.123 --> 33:26.424
The first person she
mentioned was Odell,

33:26.459 --> 33:29.441
because Odell Dwyer is a murderer.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.329
And you want to set him free.

33:32.474 --> 33:33.732
Well, screw that.

33:43.209 --> 33:44.509
The eyewitness is out.

33:44.543 --> 33:47.112
And the beech leaves.
I did a little digging.

33:47.146 --> 33:49.147
Found out that the lab tech
who worked on Odell's case

33:49.181 --> 33:51.182
was fired later that year for drinking

33:51.217 --> 33:53.518
and repeatedly contaminating evidence.

33:53.552 --> 33:55.453
It's likely she accidentally
transferred leaves

33:55.488 --> 33:57.822
from Anna's clothes to Odell's car.

33:57.857 --> 33:59.691
Definitely not a moron...

33:59.725 --> 34:00.625
today.

34:00.659 --> 34:03.728
The case against Odell
seems pretty weak,

34:03.763 --> 34:06.531
and I think he's innocent.

34:06.565 --> 34:09.300
So recommend vacating his conviction.

34:09.335 --> 34:11.503
This isn't about what I
believe, what any of us believe.

34:11.536 --> 34:14.339
We need an undeniable case that
Odell doesn't belong in prison.

34:14.373 --> 34:17.208
The key to winning trials
as a defense attorney...

34:17.243 --> 34:19.543
pick one story to tell
the jury and stick to it.

34:19.578 --> 34:20.545
Odell's story is that

34:20.579 --> 34:23.181
she wasn't writing
about him in her journal.

34:23.215 --> 34:26.184
Let's believe him, try and back it up.

34:26.217 --> 34:27.485
Someone in here order a pig?

34:27.520 --> 34:29.154
Yeah, that's me. On the table's good.

34:32.391 --> 34:33.425
What the hell?

34:33.458 --> 34:35.757
Look, I've been so hung
up on his lack of alibi,

34:35.782 --> 34:36.924
I forgot about this.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.862
What if the prosecution was wrong

34:38.898 --> 34:40.697
about Anna's time of death?

34:40.733 --> 34:43.435
Odell's alibi might be the
football game that night.

34:43.469 --> 34:45.235
I want to test the time
of death with the pig.

34:45.271 --> 34:46.704
Grab the pork and go.
We're running out of time.

34:46.739 --> 34:48.406
Okay, let's go.

34:49.873 --> 34:52.609
Prosecution claims Anna died
between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m.

34:52.878 --> 34:54.746
Help me unwrap Wilbur.

34:55.958 --> 34:58.750
When Anna's body was found,
there were no flies on her,

34:58.784 --> 35:01.619
and no fly larvae was
found at the autopsy.

35:01.654 --> 35:03.421
The thing about flies,

35:03.456 --> 35:06.424
they're drawn to animal
and human remains right away

35:06.459 --> 35:08.626
if the death occurs during the day.

35:08.661 --> 35:11.129
At night, it's too cold.

35:11.163 --> 35:14.365
Flies hibernate unless they're
already at a food source.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.536
So, no flies on Anna's body
means she was shot after dark,

35:18.571 --> 35:19.804
when Odell was his game.

35:19.839 --> 35:22.607
It might. This experiment
should prove it for sure.

35:22.641 --> 35:23.708
This half goes out now...

35:23.742 --> 35:25.810
And the other half goes out after dark.

35:25.845 --> 35:27.812
Then we wait and check for flies.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.180
He scared me today.

35:36.205 --> 35:37.832
Odell wants me to go
to the game tonight.

35:37.857 --> 35:39.791
He scared me today.

35:41.728 --> 35:43.296
He won't leave me alone.

35:43.331 --> 35:45.193
He got so mad.

35:45.218 --> 35:46.926
- I'm scared.
- Stars turned out to support

35:46.951 --> 35:48.800
Harper Morrison's Senate campaign,

35:48.834 --> 35:51.918
including a surprise
guest... her daughter, Hayes.

35:52.012 --> 35:53.314
Hayes and Harper's relationship

35:53.339 --> 35:55.373
has been described as
strained over the years...

35:55.408 --> 35:57.075
He won't leave me alone.

35:57.109 --> 35:59.177
He scared me today.

35:59.211 --> 36:01.479
My mom has no idea how weird he is.

36:01.514 --> 36:03.048
He scared me today.

36:05.718 --> 36:07.385
My mom read my diary as a kid.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.620
Okay...?

36:08.654 --> 36:11.189
I gave everyone a code name
so I could have some privacy.

36:11.223 --> 36:13.324
Maybe Anna did the same
thing in her journal.

36:13.359 --> 36:16.594
So, instead of writing he,
she was writing "H-E"?

36:16.629 --> 36:18.396
Question is, who was she worried

36:18.431 --> 36:19.664
that might be reading her journal?

36:19.698 --> 36:21.733
Maybe it was her mom or...

36:21.767 --> 36:24.669
maybe someone else had
access, someone like...

36:28.407 --> 36:30.241
- ...this guy.
- Who is that?

36:30.276 --> 36:32.610
Whoever he is, he's in a bunch
of these, and he's not a cop.

36:32.645 --> 36:35.547
Where's the DD5 from the police
interview with Anna's mom?

36:38.784 --> 36:41.586
Lupe barely speaks English.
Does McNally speak Spanish?

36:41.620 --> 36:42.654
No.

36:42.688 --> 36:45.190
No mention of a police
interpreter being present.

36:45.224 --> 36:47.258
Then who translated that conversation?

36:47.293 --> 36:51.229
According to the report...
"A family friend helped out."

36:51.263 --> 36:54.566
A friend named...

36:54.600 --> 36:56.401
Hector. Lupe talked about him.

36:56.435 --> 36:58.269
Hector's last name?

36:58.304 --> 37:00.171
Esparia.

37:01.907 --> 37:04.209
Looks like we have a suspect.

37:13.754 --> 37:15.555
We're looking for Hector Esparia.

37:15.589 --> 37:16.723
He doesn't live here anymore.

37:16.757 --> 37:17.957
Any idea where we can find him?

37:17.992 --> 37:19.793
- No.
- It's very important.

37:19.827 --> 37:21.427
Any information you can give us.

37:21.462 --> 37:23.263
Look, unless you have a warrant...

37:23.297 --> 37:24.697
Hey.

37:25.966 --> 37:28.234
You're that president's daughter.

37:31.222 --> 37:32.455
She looks like me.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.408
Apparently, Hector asked Anna
out a few times and she said no.

37:35.442 --> 37:37.496
Well, Hector's not big on "no."

37:38.231 --> 37:40.512
He's got a temper.

37:40.903 --> 37:42.949
Cindy, did Hector get violent with you?

37:44.752 --> 37:46.319
Look...

37:46.353 --> 37:48.922
whatever happened, it's not your fault.

37:48.956 --> 37:51.825
If Hector killed Anna,
the cops are to blame

37:51.859 --> 37:54.027
because we put the wrong
guy away for murder.

37:55.830 --> 37:56.963
How did she die?

37:56.997 --> 37:58.631
Gunshot to the head.

37:58.666 --> 38:01.968
There's something you should see.

38:06.807 --> 38:08.808
All right. It's 12:04.

38:08.843 --> 38:10.610
It's the time police found Anna's body.

38:13.013 --> 38:15.982
I found this in the back
of one of his drawers.

38:16.016 --> 38:18.518
I hid it so he wouldn't use it on me.

38:34.969 --> 38:36.836
No flies.

38:36.871 --> 38:38.004
That proves it.

38:38.038 --> 38:39.839
Anna died after dark.

38:39.874 --> 38:42.442
And on September 2, 2008,

38:42.476 --> 38:44.510
it was dark at 7:25 p.m.

38:44.545 --> 38:46.012
Odell was playing football.

38:46.046 --> 38:48.014
- He's innocent!
- Yeah!

38:50.918 --> 38:52.418
- Hector Esparia?
- Yeah.

38:57.591 --> 38:59.125
Hector Esparia's ex-girlfriend

38:59.159 --> 39:01.394
turned over the gun
he used to kill Anna.

39:01.428 --> 39:02.695
Odell is innocent.

39:02.730 --> 39:04.030
Just got word that the judge agreed

39:04.064 --> 39:06.165
to vacate his conviction immediately.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.834
Happy ending.

39:07.868 --> 39:09.035
I told you you'd be good at this.

39:09.069 --> 39:10.887
And I told you I'm dangerous.

39:12.504 --> 39:14.244
I'm coming after your cases, too.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.475
I'd expect nothing less.

39:15.509 --> 39:16.551
You're not scared?

39:16.576 --> 39:18.143
That's not the first
thing that comes to mind.

39:18.168 --> 39:19.913
Press charges on the cocaine,

39:19.947 --> 39:21.915
and I'll reveal that you blackmailed me

39:21.949 --> 39:23.516
into taking this job.

39:23.550 --> 39:24.851
How's that for a happy ending?

39:24.885 --> 39:26.373
That arrangement was
made with your mother.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.421
- You can't expose it without...
- Without exposing her?

39:28.455 --> 39:29.722
I know.

39:29.757 --> 39:31.891
You can't control me anymore.

39:31.926 --> 39:34.494
And neither can she.

39:37.197 --> 39:38.564
What do you want?

39:38.599 --> 39:41.034
To right the wrongs, to fight the power,

39:41.068 --> 39:42.635
to stick it to the man.

39:44.138 --> 39:45.838
Why be the fox guarding the henhouse

39:45.873 --> 39:48.541
when I can be the wolf who mauls the fox

39:48.575 --> 39:50.743
and anyone else who gets in her way?

39:53.275 --> 39:55.071
See you around, Wallace.

40:06.260 --> 40:07.593
Thought you might want to comment on

40:07.628 --> 40:10.406
how Hayes Morrison
ended up running the CIU.

40:44.631 --> 40:46.766
Maxine: Your ex let me have a copy.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.668
Retire or IA gets one, too.

41:57.905 --> 41:59.338
What the hell is all this?

41:59.373 --> 42:00.706
Possible cases.

42:00.741 --> 42:02.642
We've been getting
deliveries all morning.

42:18.959 --> 42:20.359
Who's next?
