Damn it, damn it, damn it! This is
such a stupid goddamn situation.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.394
We've got to get out of here,
Dennis. We have got to get out of here.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.398
We need a plan. Okay, well, plan one
is for you to lower your goddamn voice.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.567
This is as low
as I go, okay?

00:25.651 --> 00:29.154

choke her out with her own belt.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.697
Dee, you're escalating shit.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.698
This Is exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:32.783 --> 00:36.245
We immediately escalate everything
to a 10. It's ridiculous.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.831
| mean, somebody comes in
with some preposterous plan or idea,

00:39.915 --> 00:41.833
and then all of a sudden,
everybody's on the gas.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.544
Nobody's on the brakes.
Nobody's thinking.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.837
Everybody's just talking over each other
with one idiotic idea after another,

00:45.921 --> 00:47.965
until finally,
we find ourselves in a situation...

00:48.048 --> 00:50.717
where we've broken into somebody's
house, and the homeowner is home.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.802
Yes, yes.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.136
I'm sick of it, Dee.
Okay.

We can't do this anymore.
Okay.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.640
We've got to examine
our process.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.935
Fine. I'm on board with that. But right
now I'm trying to come up with solutions.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.812
If you don't want
to choke her out, we won't.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.230
But you need to help me come up
with a plan. This is breaking and entering.

Okay. Okay.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.825
Oh, my God. We are really
in over our heads this time.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.105
I'm saying this was
a totally avoidable situation.

in all this, okay?

table and given that awesome speech...

into the house because of my wonderful grace.

It was a very persuasive speech.

a suitcase.

quadruple onions on your burger.

[Mac ] Yes, Extraction Team.

What is your status?
Have you recovered the artifact yet?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.821
No. We are off the artifact plan.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.491
We are not doing
the artifact plan anymore.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.242
It is a stupid plan.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.163
Negative, negative.
It is an awesome plan, okay?

02:43.246 --> 02:46.541
This family should not have the artifact.
It belongs in a museum.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.126
Belongs in a museum, bro.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.421
Adults should not be making plans
that are based on dumb movies!

<i>Excuse me"? Indiana Jones
is 2 dumb movie?</i>

[ Dennis ] Okay,

03:01.807 --> 03:03.809
I'm just saying that
the plan was genuinely dumb,

03:03.892 --> 03:06.144
as many of our plans are,
| now realize.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.064
What about your whole speech
about “I have the grace of a falcon,

03:09.147 --> 03:11.024
and I'll be in and out
like a demon's whisper”?

03:11.149 --> 03:15.779
Dude, you stood up on your chair in that burger
restaurant and said that speech for everybody.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.741
It was a damn good speech. It was
very persuasive. But I regret it now.

Wait, wait. Dee— Dee,

She could come back in here
at any moment. Well, what—

03:26.790 --> 03:28.542
[Mac ] Indiana Jones,

<i>I'll give you that. [ Charlie

Doom's out for me, as well.

That's also dumb.

Forget about the vase, Frank.
We're bailing on the vase, okay?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.394
Frank's right actually, okay?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.479
We gotta think about
what's best for the vase.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.649
Yes, we are men of honor who protect
artifacts from those who steal them.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.153

about artifacts two hours ago.

<i>So what? Now we do. Yeah.
What's that have 10 do with anything?</i>

03:58.655 --> 04:02.451
Well, we should not be committing crimes
based on beliefs that are two hours old.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.954
Well, then don't read us newspaper articles
about stolen artifacts that outrage us.

04:06.079 --> 04:10.625
That article was about how the museum
is holding an auction to raise money, okay?

04:10.709 --> 04:12.753
Nothing was stolen.
The vase is not stolen.

04:12.836 --> 04:16.005
As a matter of fact, only if we follow through
with this plan will the vase be stolen.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.675
Well, you were the ones who escalated
us off of being the Extraction Team.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.302
We could have gotten
in and out of there.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.888

- See? Now, Frank, that is why you are on the Extraction Team.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.566

has the grace. Dee nosed in.

Okay, I'm repeating here.

Okay, yes, I'm seeing now
that they are cowboy—

05:01.134 --> 05:03.261
His feet could be pointed
on the inside, so let's be—

05:03.386 --> 05:05.222

the inside. How do you know that?
