WEBVTT

00:08.457 --> 00:10.324
(Exercise machine pumping)

00:10.325 --> 00:12.326
WOMAN ON PHONE:
Yours is the 17th proposal
I'll be seeing

00:12.327 --> 00:15.614
and to be honest,
not one has blown me away.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.732
If you want to have a real shot
at the Browning bid,

00:17.733 --> 00:19.217
you'll have to get
one thing.

00:19.218 --> 00:21.853
These aren't pit hands
hiring a tax attorney

00:21.854 --> 00:25.590
to scour
their lunch receipts...

00:25.591 --> 00:27.359
Jesus Christ,
I want one of you little boys

00:27.360 --> 00:28.743
to show me
what I'm paying you for.

00:28.744 --> 00:30.211
MAN:
Yes, ma'am.

00:30.212 --> 00:31.863
WOMAN:
When I talk about
an 8-figure company

00:31.864 --> 00:34.482
looking for...
they can call their own,

00:34.483 --> 00:36.284
I'm talking about
growing up,

00:36.285 --> 00:38.770
realizing that the Federal
Reserve is the World Bank

00:38.771 --> 00:40.655
loaning us money,

00:40.656 --> 00:42.640
and our federal government
has had to bail them out.

00:42.641 --> 00:44.076
Yes, ma'am.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.078
This is the end of the world
I'm talking about,

00:46.079 --> 00:47.445
leaving
the taxpayers--

00:47.446 --> 00:48.830
and let's be frank,
the well-to-do--

00:48.831 --> 00:51.583
with a deficit that
we'll never see paid back.

00:51.584 --> 00:54.152
The interest alone turns us
into indentured slaves,

00:54.153 --> 00:56.020
for fuck's sake...

00:56.021 --> 00:59.040
(Continues indistinct)

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.369 --> 01:12.720
Now, let's talk numbers.

01:12.721 --> 01:14.422
Yes, ma'am.

01:14.423 --> 01:17.425
1-3-7...

01:17.426 --> 01:20.261
5-6-4...

01:20.262 --> 01:23.315
3-0-1...

01:23.316 --> 01:29.204
(Continues calling numbers)

01:34.009 --> 01:36.944
We'll see every
Tom, Dick and Harry

01:36.945 --> 01:39.547
with a 401(k) get defaulted.

01:39.548 --> 01:41.516
Yes, ma'am.

01:41.517 --> 01:45.503
(Continues indistinct)

01:57.466 --> 02:00.134
Yes, ma'am. I'm stepping into
the shower right now.

02:00.135 --> 02:03.855
I'll see you in 45.
Thank you.

02:27.763 --> 02:28.763
Morning.

02:28.764 --> 02:30.749
Morning.

02:54.523 --> 02:56.024
I'm Rick.

02:56.025 --> 02:57.025
John.

02:57.026 --> 02:59.194
You just move
into 404?

02:59.195 --> 03:00.928
I did.
Nice building.

03:00.929 --> 03:02.814
Nice to meet you.

03:02.815 --> 03:05.700
Nice to meet you,
John.

03:14.326 --> 03:16.127
Have a good day.

03:16.128 --> 03:18.129
You too.

03:26.605 --> 03:28.039
(Phone ringing)

03:48.210 --> 03:49.711
This is John.

03:51.563 --> 03:59.770
¶

03:59.771 --> 04:01.655
Morning.

04:04.559 --> 04:06.560
Morning.

04:26.498 --> 04:28.516
John, Ms. Craig
is waiting.

04:46.802 --> 04:48.553
(No audio)

05:15.364 --> 05:16.715
I want you to look them
in the eye and tell them

05:16.716 --> 05:18.750
everyone cheats
on their federal income taxes.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.452
Nobody wants to pay them,
and thanks to the Internet,

05:21.453 --> 05:24.022
everyone knows there's no law
requiring them to do so.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.608
But tell them that
your specialty as a tax attorney

05:26.609 --> 05:29.794
is creating the loopholes
while appearing under the radar.

05:29.795 --> 05:31.562
Which equals money.

05:31.563 --> 05:34.381
JOHN:
What did you think of the
proposal so far, though?

05:34.382 --> 05:38.169
I think that there was
not one single moment

05:38.170 --> 05:40.871
where I truly felt
you pull out your dick

05:40.872 --> 05:43.791
and state what my firm brings
to the table.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.943
Thank God you have time
to put together a new proposal.

05:45.944 --> 05:48.713
Ms. Craig,
Mr. Tayson for 3:00.

05:48.714 --> 05:51.048
Sell the illusion,
John.

05:51.049 --> 05:53.150
I'm expecting more.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.843
Hey, honey.

06:02.844 --> 06:04.361
WOMAN:
Hey, are you
on your way home?

06:04.362 --> 06:08.516
Yeah, I'm just finishing some
things up here for a while.

06:08.517 --> 06:11.919
I'll call you when I leave,
all right?

06:11.920 --> 06:14.322
I love you.

06:14.323 --> 06:15.539
The pharmacy called.
Your prescription's ready.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.875
So while you're out,

06:16.876 --> 06:18.609
pick up what we need
for the barbecue tomorrow.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.628
And don't forget
the specific kind of steak

06:20.629 --> 06:21.696
my dad likes, okay?

06:21.697 --> 06:23.698
Okay. Bye.

06:28.537 --> 06:30.238
Sell the illusion.

06:30.239 --> 06:31.723
Un-fucking-believable.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.194
You know, I thought I saw you
three separate times today.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.561
But every time I'd turn
to do a double take,

06:37.562 --> 06:39.130
you'd have your back
to me.

06:39.131 --> 06:41.149
Unbelievable.

06:43.118 --> 06:45.069
What are you doing
here?

06:45.070 --> 06:48.006
Oh, my garage door opener
isn't working,

06:48.007 --> 06:49.473
so I thought
I'd come by here,

06:49.474 --> 06:53.477
check yours out and make sure
I have the correct code.

06:56.265 --> 06:57.866
Wake up, man.

06:57.867 --> 06:59.334
I'm yanking your dick.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.102
I work here.
I started today.

07:04.706 --> 07:06.207
Jesus.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.776
Yeah, I know.
What are the chances?

07:08.777 --> 07:10.311
That's unbelievable.

07:10.312 --> 07:13.814
You work here?
In what capacity?

07:13.815 --> 07:16.784
Well, um, to the best of
my abilities,

07:16.785 --> 07:19.987
I'm an attorney.

07:19.988 --> 07:21.472
I don't have this.

07:21.473 --> 07:23.240
My office.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.745
That's wild.

07:28.814 --> 07:30.381
Yeah.

07:30.382 --> 07:32.383
You definitely have
a better view than me.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.123
What did you say
your last name was?

07:39.124 --> 07:41.709
Puliti.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.044
Jonathan Puliti.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.480
Italian.

07:46.481 --> 07:49.684
Grandpa called you
Johnny boy, I'll bet.

07:49.685 --> 07:51.686
Um, that's Irish.

07:51.687 --> 07:52.920
Puliti is Irish?

07:52.921 --> 07:55.356
Putting "boy"
after a name.

07:55.357 --> 07:57.158
Danny boy.

07:57.159 --> 07:59.293
Um...

07:59.294 --> 08:02.863
look, I just got hit
with a bunch of work here.

08:02.864 --> 08:04.265
I should get back to it.

08:04.266 --> 08:08.352
Are you a fucking pussy?
It's Friday.

08:08.353 --> 08:10.054
MS. CRAIG:
John, I'm in San Francisco
for the weekend.

08:10.055 --> 08:12.373
Have the 2004 inquests
sent in a PDF

08:12.374 --> 08:13.507
so Charlotte
can look them over

08:13.508 --> 08:15.076
and have the draft
mocked up for Tuesday.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.411
Yes, ma'am.
Hello.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.930
Hello.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.298
Rick Carlson.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.967
Cynthia Craig.
Welcome aboard.

08:22.968 --> 08:25.536
Sorry I haven't had a chance
to introduce myself to you.

08:25.537 --> 08:26.520
Just one
of those days?

08:26.521 --> 08:28.056
One of those days.

08:28.057 --> 08:31.058
I'm hoping to smooth
some of that out around here.

08:31.059 --> 08:32.376
I'm counting on it.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.128
Fink and Meyer put up
a hell of a fight

08:34.129 --> 08:35.880
about
not letting you go.

08:35.881 --> 08:39.918
So you want to talk shop
or get out of here?

08:39.919 --> 08:42.318
Excuse me?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.255
It's Friday night.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.873
I'm sure you want
to get your life.

08:45.874 --> 08:47.307
I'm set up
across the hall

08:47.308 --> 08:49.576
and Johnny boy here
is walking me

08:49.577 --> 08:51.562
through all the appropriate
office protocol.

08:51.563 --> 08:53.731
If you have some time on Monday,
we can get acquainted.

08:53.732 --> 08:56.517
What's going on in
San Francisco this weekend?

08:56.518 --> 08:59.020
It's
my mother's birthday.

08:59.021 --> 09:00.554
Big 7-0.

09:00.555 --> 09:02.657
70, Jesus!

09:02.658 --> 09:04.458
Tell her
it's the new 50.

09:04.459 --> 09:08.178
I like that.
Makes me 30.

09:08.179 --> 09:09.380
Makes us
the same age.

09:09.381 --> 09:10.531
I think it makes you
about 10.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.885
John.

09:14.886 --> 09:15.903
Yes, ma'am?

09:15.904 --> 09:18.022
Go by Mr. Carlson
a drink.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.957
Yes, ma'am.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.776
Have a good weekend.

09:21.777 --> 09:23.310
I will.

09:23.311 --> 09:24.946
Have fun.

09:33.055 --> 09:36.457
(John chuckling)

09:36.458 --> 09:38.943
I give you one week,
then you're fired.

09:38.944 --> 09:40.544
Good thing you're not making
the fucking decisions.

09:40.545 --> 09:42.413
Let's get a drink.

09:42.414 --> 09:44.331
(Music pounding)

09:44.332 --> 09:49.704
¶

09:49.705 --> 09:53.174
¶ Searching for sound
in every hole in the ground ¶

09:53.175 --> 09:56.543
¶ I found you
standing there ¶

09:56.544 --> 09:59.964
¶ Lost in the crowd ¶

09:59.965 --> 10:04.151
¶ Lost beside me ¶

10:04.152 --> 10:06.520
A toast.

10:06.521 --> 10:07.622
To fate.

10:07.623 --> 10:08.956
All right,
to fate.

10:11.493 --> 10:12.560
So what's your story,
John?

10:12.561 --> 10:14.495
How did you wind up
the head lapdog

10:14.496 --> 10:17.231
for the famous
Cynthia Craig?

10:17.232 --> 10:20.701
Well, I don't refer
to myself as a lapdog.

10:20.702 --> 10:22.637
Hey, don't take offence
to it, all right?

10:22.638 --> 10:24.138
It's a complement.

10:24.139 --> 10:27.308
She's got reputation for busting
balls, and on my first day,

10:27.309 --> 10:30.043
I hear the name Jonathan Puliti
15 times.

10:30.044 --> 10:31.279
I'm curious.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.813
So why did you ask me
what my last name was

10:32.814 --> 10:34.515
back in the office
there?

10:34.516 --> 10:38.085
John, do me a favour
and relax.

10:38.086 --> 10:40.604
There's 75 lawyers
that work in our building.

10:40.605 --> 10:42.105
You're not
the only John.

10:42.106 --> 10:45.710
Plus with the whole next-door
neighbour mind-fuck thing?

10:45.711 --> 10:48.129
It was too much.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.397
Well, I'll tell you,

10:50.398 --> 10:51.999
nothing's ever been
handed to me.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.269
Ask my fiancée, she'll tell you
I'm a verified workaholic.

10:55.270 --> 10:58.439
That's fair enough.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.007
So Fink and Meyers,
huh?

11:00.008 --> 11:01.976
For a boutique firm,
they carry a lot of weight.

11:01.977 --> 11:04.511
Why did you leave
Chicago?

11:04.512 --> 11:06.513
Weather sucked.

11:07.549 --> 11:16.790
¶

11:16.791 --> 11:19.093
Hi.
Hi.

11:21.563 --> 11:22.763
Oh, man.

11:22.764 --> 11:32.724
¶

11:35.828 --> 11:38.329
Ladies,
Johnny boy.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.564
John, this is Tara and, sorry,
what was your name again?

11:40.565 --> 11:41.799
WOMAN:
Chrissie.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.667
Chrissie. Chrissie,
this is the birthday boy.

11:43.668 --> 11:46.370
WOMEN:
Happy birthday.

11:46.371 --> 11:47.705
Excuse me, can you get us
another round

11:47.706 --> 11:48.973
for my friend and I,

11:48.974 --> 11:50.407
and whatever the ladies
are having? Ladies?

11:50.408 --> 11:51.408
Pink martinis.

11:51.409 --> 11:53.878
Pink martinis, two.

11:55.447 --> 11:58.649
So are you celebrating
your birthday?

11:58.650 --> 12:00.151
Or are you drowning it?

12:04.806 --> 12:06.340
Uh, well.

12:06.341 --> 12:09.243
He's celebrating.

12:09.244 --> 12:11.879
So, what do
you guys do?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.580
For fun
or for work?

12:13.581 --> 12:15.216
For retarded children.

12:15.217 --> 12:18.469
Oh come on,
that's evil. Don't.

12:18.470 --> 12:19.904
RICK:
No, what do you two
do for fun?

12:19.905 --> 12:24.242
Well, I like to get out
of town on the weekends.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.410
I like
to go dancing.

12:26.411 --> 12:28.345
You dance while you're
out of town on the weekends?

12:28.346 --> 12:30.047
Perhaps, but only
with strange men.

12:30.048 --> 12:31.082
Of course.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.850
Yes. What about you?
Strange men, or--

12:32.851 --> 12:34.085
No, I am
the strange man.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.788
(Laughing)

12:36.789 --> 12:40.324
¶

12:40.325 --> 12:44.044
¶ Something in the back
of my mind ¶

12:44.045 --> 12:47.648
¶ Said I shouldn't
be there ¶

12:47.649 --> 12:49.149
All right,
let's get naked!

12:49.150 --> 12:51.018
Yeah.

12:51.019 --> 12:53.621
¶ Something in your eyes
told me I should stay ¶

12:53.622 --> 13:03.380
¶

13:26.905 --> 13:30.625
¶ What do you want me
to do? ¶

13:30.626 --> 13:34.862
¶ What do you want me
to do? ¶

13:34.863 --> 13:38.249
¶ What do you want me
to do? ¶

13:38.250 --> 13:41.051
¶ What do you want me
to do? ¶

13:42.888 --> 13:44.554
Hey, now the party
can start.

13:44.555 --> 13:47.324
Rick, ladies, I'm sorry.
I really have to take off.

13:47.325 --> 13:48.592
Sorry, but you've got to
drink that.

13:48.593 --> 13:50.560
You can't go,
it's your birthday.

13:50.561 --> 13:51.962
Uh...

13:51.963 --> 13:53.264
Look, we're going to
have a toast.

13:53.265 --> 13:54.664
One quick toast,
real quick, all right?

13:54.665 --> 13:56.550
Come here, sit down.

13:57.986 --> 13:59.120
To Johnny Puliti.

14:05.227 --> 14:06.793
Happy birthday,
buddy boy.

14:06.794 --> 14:08.195
Cheers.

14:08.196 --> 14:10.364
Cheers.

14:13.618 --> 14:15.753
John, come here.

14:18.523 --> 14:21.008
Come on.

14:21.009 --> 14:22.642
What is it?

14:22.643 --> 14:24.544
I got you something.

14:24.545 --> 14:26.080
Oh, for my birthday?

14:26.081 --> 14:28.349
A present?
You shouldn't have.

14:31.853 --> 14:33.821
Look under
the table.

14:33.822 --> 14:35.823
What's under
the table?

14:38.376 --> 14:40.361
It's your present.

14:40.362 --> 14:44.131
Okay.

14:44.132 --> 14:45.633
What is it?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.835
What you have there?

14:47.836 --> 14:49.436
Oh!

14:49.437 --> 14:52.540
(Laughing)

14:52.541 --> 14:54.774
What's the matter, you don't
want to open your present?

14:54.775 --> 14:56.776
You got me.

14:58.213 --> 15:01.648
I got you?

15:03.351 --> 15:06.420
Okay, one more toast
and then I got to go.

15:06.421 --> 15:08.022
I'm sorry,
I'm engaged.

15:08.023 --> 15:10.624
Well, that's too bad because
I thought that we had something.

15:10.625 --> 15:13.560
We've got drinks.
Toast!

15:13.561 --> 15:16.163
Won't you
come over here?

15:16.164 --> 15:18.165
Don't be shy,
come on.

15:20.035 --> 15:21.902
¶ What do you want me
to do? ¶

15:21.903 --> 15:31.895
¶

15:39.354 --> 15:41.322
Oh man,
that was great.

15:41.323 --> 15:42.756
Come on.

15:42.757 --> 15:44.725
No, I've got to go.
Really, thanks for the fun.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.059
We'll have
a nightcap.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.211
Seriously, Rick,
I can't.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.378
See you Monday.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.865
Hey!

15:50.866 --> 15:54.735
Wait, did you give that girl
money or something?

15:54.736 --> 15:56.570
It was her idea.

15:56.571 --> 15:57.938
Bull.

15:57.939 --> 15:59.589
Bull.

15:59.590 --> 16:00.924
Come on, man.
Things like that...

16:02.677 --> 16:04.694
...don't happen to me.
What did you do?

16:04.695 --> 16:08.582
I said, "Show John
your pussy."

16:13.538 --> 16:15.673
You just said it?

16:15.674 --> 16:18.158
It's the end of the world, man.
Do what you want.

16:18.159 --> 16:19.910
(Phone ringing)

16:19.911 --> 16:21.478
Sorry, hold on.

16:22.713 --> 16:25.382
Hey, honey!

16:25.383 --> 16:28.535
Yeah, I'm just--
I'm right by the elevator.

16:28.536 --> 16:31.856
No, I didn't see
that you called.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.308
(Stammering)

16:34.309 --> 16:37.444
Ms. Craig insisted that I get
a drink for a colleague and...

16:37.445 --> 16:39.796
Look, I'm right by
the elevator.

16:39.797 --> 16:41.881
I'll be there
in two seconds.

16:41.882 --> 16:43.884
Okay.
Bye.

16:46.288 --> 16:48.021
That's why I don't have
a relationship

16:48.022 --> 16:49.906
that lasts longer
than six months.

16:53.061 --> 16:55.529
Yeah.
She's...

16:55.530 --> 16:58.882
We're engaged.

16:58.883 --> 17:00.250
You mentioned that.

17:02.470 --> 17:08.291
Um, I have so much
on my mind, you know?

17:08.292 --> 17:10.060
I'd rather just
not fight.

17:10.060 --> 17:14.882
As long as
you're happy, right?

17:14.883 --> 17:18.135
Hey, peace is the only battle
worth waging, you know?

17:18.136 --> 17:19.970
I envy you.

17:19.971 --> 17:22.223
Stable job,
stable girl.

17:22.223 --> 17:24.657
It's all you can
hope for, right?

17:24.659 --> 17:28.161
We're definitely stable.

17:28.162 --> 17:29.930
Now, I mean.

17:29.931 --> 17:32.916
She's a few years older than me
and when we met,

17:32.917 --> 17:38.088
I thought I needed stable and
more mature to calm me down.

17:38.089 --> 17:41.125
Can I be honest
with you, John?

17:41.126 --> 17:43.527
Yeah.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.729
You're boring
the shit out of me.

17:48.516 --> 17:50.950
(Laughing)
Wake up!
Wake up.

17:50.951 --> 17:52.786
Look, man, get in there
and finger bang her

17:52.787 --> 17:54.154
like Lenny Kravitz.

17:54.155 --> 17:56.590
The two of you could use it,
okay? All right?

17:56.591 --> 17:58.592
Yeah.
All right.

17:58.593 --> 17:59.826
See you Monday.
Monday.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.921
WOMAN:
Where have you been?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.078
Sorry I'm so late.

18:42.053 --> 18:44.054
Go walk the dog.

18:54.366 --> 18:58.335
(Shouting)
Jennifer, could you bring up
those veggie burgers, please?

18:58.336 --> 19:01.588
Hello, I'm right here!
Mr. Grumpy.

19:01.589 --> 19:02.839
Hey, let me
handle the steak.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.940
Get yourself a beer.

19:03.941 --> 19:05.242
Want one?

19:05.243 --> 19:07.277
Yeah, grab me another.
Yeah.

19:13.768 --> 19:15.335
JENNIFER:
Dad, will you
put these on for John?

19:15.336 --> 19:16.770
Oh right,
the vegetarian cuisine.

19:16.771 --> 19:17.871
Don't start!

19:17.872 --> 19:19.723
What? What?

19:29.634 --> 19:31.134
Thank you.

19:31.135 --> 19:32.736
How's the work going,
John?

19:32.737 --> 19:34.371
It's going.

19:34.372 --> 19:36.340
I'm working on a pretty complex
deal right now.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.541
SISTER:
Working for
The Man.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.476
As opposed to working
for the DMV?

19:39.477 --> 19:42.145
Touché.

19:42.146 --> 19:44.164
John, why don't you invite
that friend of yours over?

19:44.165 --> 19:47.601
A co-worker of John's
just moved into the building.

19:47.602 --> 19:49.503
He's...uh...

19:49.504 --> 19:52.773
he's kind of,
I don't know.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.659
He had him out till 1:00
in the morning.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.746
DAD:
I don't know if I can handle
two lawyers while I'm eating.

19:58.747 --> 20:00.380
Daddy.
Marty.

20:00.381 --> 20:02.482
Goddammit,
I'm messing around!

20:02.483 --> 20:03.884
Who wants a steak?

21:31.823 --> 21:33.824
RICK:
Spying on me?

21:36.043 --> 21:37.778
Shit!

21:37.779 --> 21:41.014
Bitch, you scared
the daylights out of me.

21:41.015 --> 21:43.249
I knocked
on your door.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.620
I wanted to see if you wanted
to join us for a barbecue.

21:49.758 --> 21:52.626
And I was spying
on you.

21:57.398 --> 21:58.998
Wanted to see
if you were home.

21:58.999 --> 22:01.868
Let me get
some shoes.

22:04.605 --> 22:06.606
JOHN:
You've got a better view
than me.

22:14.932 --> 22:16.466
You got any pets?

22:16.467 --> 22:19.802
I've got a dog...

22:19.803 --> 22:22.005
and fish.

22:22.006 --> 22:23.773
Fish are cool.

22:23.774 --> 22:25.909
Yeah.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.611
Work, though.

22:27.612 --> 22:30.647
Yeah. Animals are better
than people.

22:30.648 --> 22:32.649
They don't
bullshit you.

22:34.385 --> 22:38.221
You wouldn't bullshit me,
would you?

22:38.222 --> 22:39.957
Think you could ever
kill someone?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.625
Huh?

22:41.626 --> 22:44.395
You know, like self-defence
or whatever.

22:47.265 --> 22:48.499
I've never really
thought about it.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.917
I've got enough anxiety
as it is

22:49.918 --> 22:51.084
and I've never done
anything wrong,

22:51.085 --> 22:53.453
so I doubt it.

22:53.454 --> 22:55.289
So you think
that killing someone,

22:55.290 --> 22:57.123
even in self-defence,
is wrong?

23:00.344 --> 23:02.362
I don't know.
Why do you ask?

23:04.398 --> 23:06.399
Are you on meds?

23:10.888 --> 23:13.156
I'm not judging you.

23:13.157 --> 23:15.525
I used to be.

23:15.526 --> 23:17.561
I just got a vibe,
that's all.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.930
I've been on prescription
drugs for most of my life.

23:19.931 --> 23:24.501
It was first for ADD,
and then ADHD, manic depression,

23:24.502 --> 23:26.603
and now it's hyperanxiety.

23:26.604 --> 23:28.688
What about you?
You said "were"?

23:28.689 --> 23:31.408
Until I found out
what mind control is.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.994
The shit's poison.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.150
I didn't realize
you're a doctor.

23:41.151 --> 23:43.053
I'm not.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.571
Scientologist?

23:44.572 --> 23:46.940
No.

23:46.941 --> 23:49.092
I self-medicate
now.

23:49.093 --> 23:50.210
With what?

23:50.211 --> 23:52.595
Not giving
a shit.

23:56.317 --> 23:58.318
Look her
in the eye.

24:01.956 --> 24:04.424
Yeah.

24:04.425 --> 24:06.693
You're a dog person.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.151
JOHN:
Everybody,
this is Rick.

24:15.152 --> 24:17.521
Rick, this is Jennifer,
my fiancée.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.456
This is her mother,
Sherry.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.441
This is Stephanie,
my sister...

24:21.442 --> 24:23.343
who likes bad boys.

24:23.344 --> 24:24.911
This is her father,
Marty.

24:24.912 --> 24:25.812
How are you doing,
Marty?

24:25.813 --> 24:27.063
Shiny watch.

24:27.064 --> 24:29.365
Watch out, Marty has
an aversion to money

24:29.366 --> 24:30.600
and those who make it.

24:30.601 --> 24:32.201
JENNIFER:
John!

24:32.202 --> 24:33.703
I'm just
messing around.

24:33.704 --> 24:35.989
We have that kind of
relationship, don't we, Marty?

24:35.990 --> 24:37.440
I guess we do.

24:37.441 --> 24:39.476
Rick, please.

24:39.477 --> 24:42.762
I'll grab you something.

24:42.763 --> 24:53.156
¶

25:16.047 --> 25:17.380
Saint Peter's like,
"Sister, Sister...

25:17.381 --> 25:19.516
we're all gonna get
into heaven."

25:19.517 --> 25:22.485
(All laughing)

25:24.354 --> 25:34.197
¶

25:42.456 --> 25:44.173
JOHN:
It's getting
pretty late.

25:44.174 --> 25:47.560
We should
close this thing down.

25:47.561 --> 25:50.697
Yeah,
it's so late.

25:51.982 --> 25:54.217
Rick.

25:54.218 --> 25:55.818
It was nice
to meet you.

25:55.819 --> 25:57.587
Goodnight.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.741
I'm just going to
clean up.

26:07.147 --> 26:09.733
Interesting girl.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.437
What does that mean?

26:13.438 --> 26:15.471
Nothing bad.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.778
By the way...

26:21.779 --> 26:25.715
thanks for entertaining
the troops.

26:25.716 --> 26:28.335
Families are fucked.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.619
That Marty guy
is an asshole.

26:29.620 --> 26:30.903
Whatever.

26:30.904 --> 26:32.906
No, not "whatever."

26:32.907 --> 26:35.942
I don't really care about
the dynamic in there,

26:35.943 --> 26:37.444
but I used to be
a lot like you.

26:37.445 --> 26:40.046
Don't let people push you around
in your own house.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.732
Nobody pushes me
around.

26:42.733 --> 26:45.252
I'm not judging you.

26:48.973 --> 26:51.274
My philosophy is
"know thyself."

26:51.275 --> 26:53.943
That's it.

26:53.944 --> 26:55.411
Look, you're on
the John train.

26:55.412 --> 26:57.614
Your life is the track
that you're heading down.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.615
The most anyone
can ever do

26:59.616 --> 27:02.218
is have their train running
right next to yours, right?

27:02.219 --> 27:03.570
Because that's
their life.

27:03.571 --> 27:05.638
If you know in your balls
where you're headed,

27:05.639 --> 27:08.491
if you know
who you are,

27:08.492 --> 27:11.878
then all you have to do
is look to your left

27:11.879 --> 27:17.600
and look to the right
and see who's keeping up.

27:17.601 --> 27:19.736
Everybody else
can kiss your fucking ass.

27:22.790 --> 27:25.809
It takes balls
to be an individual.

27:25.810 --> 27:29.045
Society doesn't teach you that
skill, but it rewards it,

27:29.046 --> 27:31.181
and that's how
successful people live.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.183
Independently.

27:41.258 --> 27:45.561
Sounds like you've read
a lot of self-help books.

27:45.562 --> 27:47.563
JENNIFER:
Come on, John.
Say goodnight.

27:50.434 --> 27:52.435
I've got to go.

27:53.670 --> 27:55.338
Hey, I'll see you
tomorrow.

27:58.909 --> 28:00.910
Come on, Rick.

28:03.948 --> 28:06.682
What the hell?

28:06.683 --> 28:07.984
Run along.

28:07.985 --> 28:10.854
The little lady's
calling you.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.156
I'm fucking
with you, man.

28:13.157 --> 28:14.157
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:14.158 --> 28:17.127
All right.

28:18.362 --> 28:20.930
Hey.

28:20.931 --> 28:22.999
Thanks for being real
with me.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.934
Goodnight.

28:37.931 --> 28:41.334
JENNIFER:
Take out the trash.

28:41.335 --> 28:44.037
I don't want to wake up
to the smell of all that food

28:44.038 --> 28:45.338
in the morning.

28:48.876 --> 28:50.977
Rick is...

28:50.978 --> 28:52.945
interesting.

28:52.946 --> 28:54.180
Yeah,
I like him.

28:54.181 --> 28:56.883
I don't know what kind
of a lawyer he is,

28:56.884 --> 28:58.951
but he's definitely
interesting.

28:58.952 --> 29:00.586
A little arrogant,
though.

29:00.587 --> 29:03.156
By the way, you will be
apologizing to my dad.

29:03.157 --> 29:04.524
For what?

29:04.525 --> 29:06.159
You know what.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.028
That rude comment you made
about him and money?

29:08.029 --> 29:09.396
Jennifer,
I'm tired,

29:09.397 --> 29:11.331
I've got a lot on my mind,
and your dad is an asshole.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.698
Why don't you give him
the speech

29:12.699 --> 29:14.267
and tell him
to get off my back?

29:14.268 --> 29:15.534
Excuse me?

29:15.535 --> 29:17.854
Don't be dramatic.

29:17.855 --> 29:21.191
See you in a bit.
Come on, boy.

29:39.476 --> 29:48.501
¶

30:46.994 --> 30:48.894
(Pounding music)

30:48.895 --> 30:58.905
¶

31:22.396 --> 31:24.397
(Woman moaning)

31:28.369 --> 31:30.636
(Men laughing)

31:30.637 --> 31:32.521
MAN:
She had no idea
she was on camera?

31:32.522 --> 31:33.873
It was her idea.

31:33.874 --> 31:36.108
Flip off after the money shot?
It's priceless.

31:36.109 --> 31:37.510
Yeah, that's one of my girls
likes it a little weird.

31:37.511 --> 31:39.078
One of your girls?

31:39.079 --> 31:41.247
I'd say we're fuck buddies
but we don't get along.

31:41.248 --> 31:42.565
(Men laughing)

31:42.566 --> 31:43.833
Johnny boy!

31:43.834 --> 31:45.335
Hey, come check this out.
Come here.

31:45.336 --> 31:46.802
John, Ms. Craig
wants to see you.

31:46.803 --> 31:50.373
Sorry, guys,
duty calls.

31:50.374 --> 31:51.874
Ass-kisser.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.477
(Chuckling)

31:54.478 --> 31:56.413
MS. CRAIG:
Charlotte got the PDF

31:56.414 --> 31:59.232
and she needs to go over
some of the wording with you

31:59.233 --> 32:00.400
before we send it off.

32:00.401 --> 32:02.385
Yes, ma'am.

32:02.386 --> 32:07.090
So how was
your mom's party?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.824
Excuse me?

32:08.825 --> 32:12.963
Your mom's party?
San Francisco?

32:12.964 --> 32:15.815
Fine.
Thank you for asking.

32:15.816 --> 32:17.400
John,
between us,

32:17.401 --> 32:20.787
did you have that drink
with Mr. Carlson, Friday night?

32:20.788 --> 32:21.788
I did.

32:21.789 --> 32:24.007
Something's come
to my attention,

32:24.008 --> 32:26.859
but I'm unable
to get any details.

32:26.860 --> 32:30.179
I wanted to ask you what
your opinion is of Mr. Carlson.

32:30.180 --> 32:34.550
I'm not quite sure
I understand.

32:34.551 --> 32:37.453
Well, I'm not
speaking Greek here, am I?

32:37.454 --> 32:40.205
I'm asking you what your
assessment is of Mr. Carlson.

32:40.206 --> 32:42.041
What kind of person is he,
in your opinion?

32:42.042 --> 32:45.028
Well, I think he is
a very interesting person.

32:45.029 --> 32:47.747
I don't know what kind of
tax attorney he is but--

32:47.748 --> 32:49.281
But?

32:49.282 --> 32:51.283
But, well...

32:51.284 --> 32:52.835
Why don't you quit
speaking Greek,

32:52.836 --> 32:54.904
and look at my face
when I'm talking to you?

33:00.211 --> 33:02.578
Thank you.

33:02.579 --> 33:06.949
I haven't really had enough time
to get to know Rick,

33:06.950 --> 33:10.202
but I can tell you
he's intelligent.

33:10.203 --> 33:14.090
He reads people
very well.

33:14.091 --> 33:17.076
Almost
annoyingly so.

33:17.077 --> 33:19.462
Is there something specific
you had in mind?

33:19.463 --> 33:22.031
What of
his temperament?

33:22.032 --> 33:25.502
I'm not sure
I could say.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.937
We've only had
a few conversations.

33:30.474 --> 33:31.841
This stays
between me and you.

33:31.842 --> 33:33.526
Absolutely.

33:33.527 --> 33:35.127
Thank you.
I appreciate your candour.

33:35.128 --> 33:36.496
That's all.

33:41.685 --> 33:42.836
And John?

33:42.837 --> 33:45.404
You're my first in line
for the Browning's bid.

33:45.405 --> 33:47.340
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

33:47.341 --> 33:49.843
You've got three weeks
for a new proposal.

34:07.444 --> 34:09.445
Can I call you back?

35:37.183 --> 35:39.184
What's happening,
man?

36:04.210 --> 36:06.946
That's disgusting!

36:06.947 --> 36:11.067
RICK:
How does God turn coffee
into piss?

36:11.068 --> 36:12.068
What?

36:12.069 --> 36:13.719
Could you not stare
at me, please.

36:16.290 --> 36:17.890
You're not a faggot,
are you?

36:17.891 --> 36:19.325
What?

36:19.326 --> 36:23.195
I don't care if you are,
I just think they're disgusting.

36:23.196 --> 36:27.667
That's all.

36:27.668 --> 36:29.134
Hey.

36:29.135 --> 36:30.603
Why are you
so uptight?

36:34.708 --> 36:38.544
Are you in
some kind of trouble?

36:38.545 --> 36:40.379
Not that I can tell.

36:40.380 --> 36:45.651
There isn't anyone in here
I should know about, is there?

36:45.652 --> 36:48.187
Why do you ask?

36:48.188 --> 36:50.539
Ms. Craig
was asking me about--

36:50.540 --> 36:55.144
She was asking my assessment
of you and her tone was strange.

36:55.145 --> 36:57.013
What is your assessment
of me, John?

36:57.014 --> 37:01.250
I told her
you seem intelligent.

37:01.251 --> 37:04.153
Listen, I got into a fight
when I was in college.

37:04.154 --> 37:06.322
The powers that be decided
that they should put that

37:06.323 --> 37:07.756
on my permanent record.

37:07.757 --> 37:10.076
Now, I don't talk about it,
but it does come up

37:10.077 --> 37:12.044
because I am in
the pseudo-business of law.

37:12.045 --> 37:14.279
Why is that
such a big deal?

37:14.280 --> 37:17.316
Because I was drunk
and started the fight.

37:17.317 --> 37:20.219
Serious shit in Texas.

37:20.220 --> 37:22.722
It's fucked up.

37:22.723 --> 37:24.256
You ever been
in a fight?

37:24.257 --> 37:25.658
Never.

37:25.659 --> 37:27.125
Never!

37:27.126 --> 37:30.413
But I'll bet every day you
probably feel like you struggle

37:30.414 --> 37:32.114
with everything,
don't you?

37:32.115 --> 37:34.082
Yes, I do.

37:34.083 --> 37:38.637
That feeling goes away the
second you start fighting back.

37:38.638 --> 37:40.689
We're getting
a drink tonight.

37:40.690 --> 37:41.790
Who?

37:41.791 --> 37:43.892
Who? What are you,
a fucking owl?

37:43.893 --> 37:45.060
Me and you!

37:45.061 --> 37:46.229
It's Monday.

37:46.230 --> 37:50.199
John,
how old are you?

37:50.200 --> 37:54.553
I have no idea
who you are, do I?

37:54.554 --> 37:57.590
I was sent here
to destroy you.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.245
(Laughing)
Come on, man.

38:04.247 --> 38:05.715
I'm a fucking nerd.

38:06.850 --> 38:08.667
(Laughing)

38:08.668 --> 38:17.359
¶

38:23.250 --> 38:26.586
¶ Wrapped up in my arms ¶

38:26.587 --> 38:27.753
Ahh!

38:27.754 --> 38:30.990
¶ Breathing,
breathing down ¶

38:30.991 --> 38:33.459
¶ Push it all around ¶

38:33.460 --> 38:38.464
¶

38:38.465 --> 38:42.051
¶ My heartbeat
hits the wall ¶

38:42.052 --> 38:44.053
(Yelling and laughing)

38:49.876 --> 38:52.144
Fucking ass
in your face!

38:52.145 --> 38:53.312
That's what
I'm talking about!

38:53.313 --> 38:57.416
¶ Easy, easy, easy ¶

38:57.417 --> 39:00.953
¶ Easy, easy, easy ¶

39:00.954 --> 39:04.523
¶ I touch myself
while you touch yourself ¶

39:04.524 --> 39:09.111
¶ Now come on ¶

39:09.112 --> 39:12.615
¶ Easy, easy, easy ¶

39:12.616 --> 39:16.285
¶ Easy, easy, easy ¶

39:16.286 --> 39:19.254
¶ Touch your skin,
baby ¶

39:19.255 --> 39:23.426
¶ Come on ¶

39:23.427 --> 39:27.146
¶ Oh, come on ¶

39:27.147 --> 39:31.450
¶

39:31.451 --> 39:34.887
¶ Wrapped up
in my arms ¶

39:34.888 --> 39:39.558
¶ Push and pull it down ¶

39:39.559 --> 39:42.027
¶ Push it all around ¶

39:42.028 --> 39:46.849
¶

39:46.850 --> 39:50.953
¶ My heartbeat
hits the wall ¶

39:50.954 --> 39:54.890
¶

39:54.891 --> 39:57.359
¶ Teardrops
on your thighs ¶

39:57.360 --> 40:02.198
¶ Tell the world that
it's easy ¶

40:02.199 --> 40:06.034
¶ Easy, easy, easy ¶

40:06.035 --> 40:08.003
¶ Easy, easy, easy ¶

40:08.004 --> 40:10.072
(Garbled speech)

40:18.481 --> 40:20.065
Go home.

40:20.066 --> 40:30.325
¶

40:42.222 --> 40:43.222
Come on!

40:43.223 --> 40:44.523
Let go
of my arm.

40:45.525 --> 40:46.825
Come on!

40:46.826 --> 40:48.827
Let go of my arm!
You're fucking annoying me.

40:48.828 --> 40:50.829
All right,
I'll see you later.

42:00.016 --> 42:02.017
RICK:
Hope there's not a body
in there.

42:12.712 --> 42:13.896
How you doing?

42:13.897 --> 42:17.199
Fine.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.869
Listen, I don't know if this is
really any of my business,

42:19.870 --> 42:21.504
but is John okay?

42:26.626 --> 42:28.493
You kidding me?

42:28.494 --> 42:30.395
In the three weeks
since you've moved here,

42:30.396 --> 42:32.531
he's turned into
a drunk asshole.

42:32.532 --> 42:33.949
Yeah,
about that.

42:35.868 --> 42:37.536
I don't think
it's such a good idea

42:37.537 --> 42:40.289
if John goes out with me
and the boys after work anymore.

42:40.290 --> 42:42.724
Excuse me?

42:42.725 --> 42:45.811
Well, we all
blow off steam,

42:45.812 --> 42:47.380
but with John,

42:47.381 --> 42:49.498
I think he bottles up
all of his stress

42:49.499 --> 42:50.783
and instead of
letting it go,

42:50.784 --> 42:53.419
he just piles up more shit
on top to cope, you know?

42:53.420 --> 42:56.055
It's just,
it's not healthy.

42:56.056 --> 42:59.858
It's not.
Look, he's had problems.

42:59.859 --> 43:01.327
Are you okay?

43:01.328 --> 43:04.280
I'm worried.

43:04.281 --> 43:06.732
Yeah?

43:09.502 --> 43:11.837
The first thing I want to do
is kick his ass.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.426
But he lets people
push him around

43:17.427 --> 43:21.213
so I try to go easy
on him.

43:21.214 --> 43:22.881
RICK:
What's bothering him?

43:22.882 --> 43:25.350
Well, you know that contract
he's putting together?

43:25.351 --> 43:28.887
Yeah, the Browning
CEO bid, right?

43:28.888 --> 43:30.456
JENNIFER:
It's a lot of money.

43:30.457 --> 43:32.424
(Indistinct chattering)

43:38.749 --> 43:41.049
...bail-out...
...$147,000...

43:41.050 --> 43:42.184
...parasite...
...parasite...

43:42.185 --> 43:43.285
...parasite...

43:43.286 --> 43:44.820
Show me your pussy.

43:44.821 --> 43:46.555
JENNIFER:
John!

43:46.556 --> 43:48.340
Good morning!

43:48.341 --> 43:51.660
Hey, you want to go
to the beach?

44:04.007 --> 44:05.007
What's up?

44:05.008 --> 44:06.008
WOMAN:
What's up?

44:06.009 --> 44:07.877
Not much.

44:07.878 --> 44:09.411
Not much.

44:13.917 --> 44:15.017
It's kind of cold.

44:15.018 --> 44:16.652
Yeah,
I've got blankets.

44:16.653 --> 44:19.354
Hey, John, Jennifer.

44:19.355 --> 44:20.656
These are my neighbours.
This is Kelly.

44:20.657 --> 44:21.957
Hey.

44:21.958 --> 44:23.826
Yeah, I seen you somewhere,
I think.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.094
Yeah.

44:26.095 --> 44:27.362
So what do you
guys think?

44:27.363 --> 44:29.431
You want to go?
Yeah, no?

44:29.432 --> 44:31.133
I should do
some work.

44:31.134 --> 44:33.235
My proposal's due
tomorrow.

44:33.236 --> 44:35.237
Suit yourself.

44:44.381 --> 44:46.081
Um...all right.

44:46.082 --> 44:49.018
Well, have fun.

45:03.716 --> 45:07.819
What were you two
talking about?

45:07.820 --> 45:09.421
I thought
you had to work.

45:09.422 --> 45:10.689
I do have to work.

45:10.690 --> 45:12.557
Look at me when you're
fucking talking to me.

45:12.558 --> 45:14.860
Considering what I'm bringing to
this relationship financially,

45:14.861 --> 45:16.495
you either start treating me
with some respect

45:16.496 --> 45:18.313
or get the fuck
out of my life!

45:18.314 --> 45:19.565
I'm tired of being
your little fucking lapdog.

45:19.566 --> 45:20.966
What?

45:20.967 --> 45:23.268
Listen, I don't expect you
to understand this, okay?

45:23.269 --> 45:25.370
But Rick and I
have a good friendship.

45:25.371 --> 45:27.840
We give each other feedback
in some very serious areas.

45:27.841 --> 45:29.674
That guy has some issues
he's dealing with.

45:29.675 --> 45:32.962
When I see my fiancée acting
like a little girl

45:32.963 --> 45:35.147
in front of him,
it pleases me off

45:35.148 --> 45:37.916
and it belittles
our relationship, okay?

45:37.917 --> 45:39.635
So I'm just looking out
for you.

45:39.636 --> 45:42.538
Now look,

45:42.539 --> 45:43.939
don't forget
to walk the dog.

46:05.795 --> 46:08.146
(Sirens wailing)

47:05.155 --> 47:06.721
MS. CRAIG:
Come on in,
John.

47:06.722 --> 47:07.856
Good morning.

47:09.059 --> 47:11.260
Just give me
the final number.

47:18.318 --> 47:20.369
It's a little
dramatic.

47:20.370 --> 47:22.421
It's the future
of my law firm.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.707
It's pretty dramatic
to me.

47:24.708 --> 47:26.492
Yes, ma'am.

47:32.882 --> 47:35.250
There may be
a few areas

47:35.251 --> 47:36.985
where my interpretations
could be skewed

47:36.986 --> 47:39.288
in one direction
or another.

47:39.289 --> 47:40.789
Yeah, that's what
you didn't get, John,

47:40.790 --> 47:43.392
and this is
what I was afraid of.

47:45.545 --> 47:49.147
The number I'm looking at here
is $147,000

47:49.148 --> 47:52.334
above the number I looked at
earlier this morning.

47:52.335 --> 47:54.386
To you, that doesn't seem like
a lot of money,

47:54.387 --> 47:59.708
but to the client, we're talking
about $147,000 less on taxes.

47:59.709 --> 48:02.510
Means there's more money
to spend on tax attorneys.

48:02.511 --> 48:05.180
I appreciate the work you did
on the proposal

48:05.181 --> 48:06.931
but it's not
going to happen.

48:09.068 --> 48:10.735
It's not
going to happen?

48:10.736 --> 48:12.371
Because you didn't take
what you could get.

48:12.372 --> 48:14.506
Because I'm not
a parasite?

48:14.507 --> 48:17.942
Everything lives
off something, John.

48:21.747 --> 48:25.783
I worked my ass off
on this proposal.

48:25.784 --> 48:27.369
Hey, look at me.

48:27.370 --> 48:29.655
I respect you.

48:29.656 --> 48:31.623
All I'm asking is that
in the future,

48:31.624 --> 48:33.742
you go one step further
than what you've been taught.

48:33.743 --> 48:38.163
Take the rest of the day off
and think about it.

48:38.164 --> 48:40.432
Learn from your friend
Rick Carlson.

48:42.001 --> 48:44.403
He got the bid?

48:44.404 --> 48:45.854
He wasn't even
asked to

48:45.855 --> 48:48.056
and he put together the most
aggressive proposal I received.

48:58.851 --> 49:02.287
RICK:
Listen, 134 million dollars.

49:02.288 --> 49:03.688
284 million dollars.

49:03.689 --> 49:07.859
150 million dollar
discrepancy.

49:07.860 --> 49:09.461
Now, when you have
a free-market trade,

49:09.462 --> 49:10.828
you've got
two opposing sides.

49:10.829 --> 49:12.497
You've got one that's
going to look at a red line.

49:12.498 --> 49:13.949
You've got another one
that's going to look

49:13.950 --> 49:15.517
at the other side of things
and think something's wrong.

49:15.518 --> 49:17.152
You know what?
Give me a minute.

49:26.696 --> 49:28.646
I thought
you were honest.

49:28.647 --> 49:30.082
I haven't lied to you
in any way, John.

49:30.083 --> 49:33.952
No, but you lied in your
proposal for the Browning's bid.

49:33.953 --> 49:36.205
$147,000?

49:36.206 --> 49:39.425
That's a lie, and I know what
that number represents.

49:39.426 --> 49:43.394
(Laughing)
You know, I don't have to
justify myself to you, John.

49:43.395 --> 49:45.964
Are you all right, man?

49:45.965 --> 49:47.599
Am I "all right"?

49:47.600 --> 49:49.334
Yeah, you just seem
a little stressed out.

49:49.335 --> 49:50.735
I'm worried about you.

49:50.736 --> 49:53.304
Jennifer's worried
about you.

49:53.305 --> 49:57.242
How do you know
what Jennifer's worried about?

49:57.243 --> 49:59.994
Because I've been fucking her,
that's why.

49:59.995 --> 50:01.846
Say it again,
motherfucker!

50:01.847 --> 50:03.515
Say it!
Say that again--

50:03.516 --> 50:04.682
Get off of me!

50:04.683 --> 50:06.384
Hey, get off of me!

50:06.385 --> 50:08.420
Hey, are you out
of your fucking mind?

50:08.421 --> 50:11.790
He's talking about
fucking my fiancée!

50:11.791 --> 50:13.208
What the hell
is going on?

50:13.209 --> 50:14.410
He stole
my information!

50:14.411 --> 50:16.011
He's talking about
fucking my fiancée!

50:16.012 --> 50:17.479
And I want him
out of here!

50:17.480 --> 50:19.715
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

50:19.716 --> 50:21.065
Wait a minute!
Listen, listen to me!

50:21.066 --> 50:22.300
I am the victim here!

50:22.301 --> 50:23.618
Listen to me!
Open your eyes!

50:23.619 --> 50:25.187
Open your fucking eyes!

50:25.188 --> 50:27.756
I am the victim here,
Cynthia!

50:27.757 --> 50:29.240
He's a fucking
snake!
Woo!

50:29.241 --> 50:30.876
I am the victim!

50:30.877 --> 50:32.261
SCOTTISH MAN:
... More use
of chemical weapons.

50:32.262 --> 50:34.696
This is how they give
their statements

50:34.697 --> 50:37.433
to the public
and into the world.

50:37.434 --> 50:40.051
I don't know how they came to
this conclusion or anything,

50:40.052 --> 50:43.054
or the think tanks
that are paid millions

50:43.055 --> 50:46.224
to go through these scenarios.
He then goes on to say...

50:46.225 --> 50:49.744
...information chips
implanted in the brain...

50:49.745 --> 50:53.415
...electromagnetic
pulse weapons...

50:53.416 --> 50:54.933
Come on!

50:54.934 --> 50:58.070
The middle class
is becoming revolutionary.

50:58.071 --> 51:00.138
You're making me sick.

51:00.139 --> 51:03.141
...population of countries
in the Middle East

51:03.142 --> 51:04.475
increasing by 132%...

51:04.476 --> 51:06.477
(Phone ringing)

51:10.482 --> 51:11.482
Fuck.

51:11.483 --> 51:13.085
...Flash mobs...

51:13.086 --> 51:15.153
What the fuck are you
looking at, motherfucker?

51:18.357 --> 51:20.625
...flash mobs, which are groups
rapidly mobilized

51:20.626 --> 51:24.462
by criminal gangs
or terrorist groups.

51:24.463 --> 51:30.285
Now, let's just go over
this little paragraph here.

51:30.286 --> 51:33.589
As I say, look at how this
is presented to the public.

51:33.590 --> 51:36.691
This is standard predictive
programming...

51:38.962 --> 51:43.848
...that's giving you fear,
on one hand,

51:43.849 --> 51:45.083
without explaining
exactly why...

51:45.084 --> 51:46.001
(Knocking on window)

51:46.002 --> 51:47.836
(Turns off radio)

51:47.837 --> 51:50.873
(Knocking)

51:50.874 --> 51:55.226
If you're going to sit here,
you have to feed the meter.

51:55.227 --> 51:58.162
I'm sorry, I'm just
on the fucking phone.

51:58.163 --> 52:00.298
Thank you.

52:11.894 --> 52:13.128
You're kidding me.

52:15.414 --> 52:18.450
Hey!

52:18.451 --> 52:19.451
Are you kidding me?

52:19.452 --> 52:21.152
I warned you.

52:21.153 --> 52:22.621
Come on,
are you kidding me?

52:22.622 --> 52:23.955
I said
I warned you.

52:23.956 --> 52:26.324
This is bullshit.
Come on, stop writing my ticket.

52:26.325 --> 52:27.626
I'm taking down
the numbers--

52:27.627 --> 52:28.911
Just stop writing
the fucking ticket!

52:28.912 --> 52:30.011
Stop writing
the fucking ticket!

52:30.012 --> 52:31.580
Are you
a fucking machine?

52:31.581 --> 52:32.764
I'm just
doing my job.

52:32.765 --> 52:34.282
Are you
a fucking machine?

52:34.283 --> 52:35.416
Stop writing
the fucking ticket!

52:35.417 --> 52:37.219
Fine, whatever.

52:37.220 --> 52:40.288
That's less money for me to
spend on immigrants, right?

52:40.289 --> 52:42.107
We were here first.

52:42.108 --> 52:43.308
No, no, no.

52:43.309 --> 52:44.776
The Indians
were here first,

52:44.777 --> 52:48.713
and we came and raped you
and you became a Mexican.

52:48.714 --> 52:51.482
Have a good day,
señor.

52:51.483 --> 52:53.484
You're a
fucking parasite.

53:13.589 --> 53:14.690
(Sirens wailing)

53:20.412 --> 53:22.413
Fucking bullshit.

53:24.550 --> 53:26.551
(Phone ringing)

53:32.542 --> 53:35.743
Come on, pick up,
Steph.

53:35.744 --> 53:37.145
ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hey, it's Steph.

53:37.146 --> 53:39.614
Leave a message
and don't bore me.

53:39.615 --> 53:42.684
Hey, it's me.

53:42.685 --> 53:45.453
Hey listen, there's some
crazy shit going on, Steph.

53:45.454 --> 53:48.874
You remember that asshole Rick
you were flirting with?

53:48.875 --> 53:51.309
He just--

53:51.310 --> 53:55.180
He just stole my fucking job
and I'm freaking out right now.

53:55.181 --> 53:58.750
Do me a favour and run his name
through the DMV system there.

53:58.751 --> 53:59.951
He should have a criminal
record.

53:59.952 --> 54:01.319
I know of one incident--

54:01.320 --> 54:03.588
I know one incident for sure
in Texas that did happen.

54:03.589 --> 54:05.507
I just don't buy that
he happened to move in

54:05.508 --> 54:07.426
across the hall from me
and happens to work

54:07.427 --> 54:09.094
in the office
across the hall from me

54:09.095 --> 54:10.695
and then
steals my fucking job!

54:10.696 --> 54:12.497
And I'm going to kill him
or something.

54:12.498 --> 54:13.982
His last name's
Carlson.

54:13.983 --> 54:17.152
There are probably
a million Rick Carlsons,

54:17.153 --> 54:19.187
so I'm going to find out his
middle name and kill...

54:19.188 --> 54:21.473
God, I wish
you'd answered.

54:21.474 --> 54:24.192
He's trying to break up
my engagement.

54:24.193 --> 54:26.845
(Holding down horn)

54:26.846 --> 54:28.713
Ha!

54:30.315 --> 54:32.751
I'm sorry.

54:32.752 --> 54:34.419
This is the longest message
in the world.

54:34.420 --> 54:37.189
Listen, I'm cool,
Steph.

54:37.190 --> 54:41.860
A little nervous breakdown
on the phone.

54:41.861 --> 54:44.395
I'm fine.

54:44.396 --> 54:47.365
Listen, I'll call you later.
All right? Bye.

55:17.946 --> 55:19.281
I've just...

55:42.238 --> 55:44.339
God!
Rick, you scared me!

55:47.209 --> 55:48.477
What did you
just say?

55:48.478 --> 55:51.596
I said, Oh God,
John, you scared me!

55:53.682 --> 55:55.166
What are you doing?

55:55.167 --> 55:56.467
Who were you
talking to?

55:56.468 --> 55:57.535
My dad.

56:03.392 --> 56:04.693
Do you lie to me?

56:06.962 --> 56:08.579
What?

56:08.580 --> 56:10.365
Do you lie to me?

56:13.169 --> 56:14.869
No.

56:23.495 --> 56:25.930
Do you love me?

56:25.931 --> 56:27.498
Of course.

56:27.499 --> 56:29.116
Which me?

56:31.053 --> 56:32.537
Hm?

56:34.857 --> 56:36.925
Which me?

56:38.744 --> 56:40.928
I'm worried about you,
John.

56:40.929 --> 56:42.597
Jonathan.

56:42.598 --> 56:44.949
I know.
Rick told me.

56:46.986 --> 56:49.837
Why are you so worried
about me?

56:49.838 --> 56:51.740
Um...

56:56.662 --> 56:58.663
Hm?

56:58.664 --> 57:01.333
What do you want,
Jennifer?

57:01.334 --> 57:03.067
Huh?

57:03.068 --> 57:04.068
Hm?

57:04.069 --> 57:06.037
Hm?

57:06.038 --> 57:07.472
Tell me
what you want.

57:09.709 --> 57:11.976
What do you want,
Jennifer?

57:15.013 --> 57:17.449
I want to be
like we were.

57:17.450 --> 57:19.634
I've been a mess
since you first met me.

57:19.635 --> 57:21.736
Let me ask you something,
and think before you answer

57:21.737 --> 57:24.205
because if you lie,
I'll know it.

57:24.206 --> 57:28.209
Did you ever show Rick any of
the papers I've been working on?

57:28.210 --> 57:30.311
God, no, John!

57:30.312 --> 57:33.481
Did you ever talk to him about
my business in any specifics?

57:35.384 --> 57:37.335
Be honest, now.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.761
I did.

57:46.762 --> 57:49.297
The other day,
in the garage,

57:49.298 --> 57:51.399
I was saying that
I was worried about you

57:51.400 --> 57:52.967
and we started talking.

57:52.968 --> 57:54.268
You and Rick
started talking.

57:54.269 --> 57:56.471
Say his name so you can
hear it, Jennifer.

57:58.307 --> 58:00.942
Rick and I started talking
about you.

58:00.943 --> 58:03.811
And we did talk
about your business,

58:03.812 --> 58:06.013
but only in the context
that it was bothering you.

58:06.014 --> 58:07.748
Well it sure as fuck
didn't bother him

58:07.749 --> 58:09.784
because thanks to you,
I lost my contract!

58:09.785 --> 58:12.387
What?

58:12.388 --> 58:16.090
You cheated
on me.

58:16.091 --> 58:18.393
You defied the trust
of this house.

58:18.394 --> 58:20.361
I only told him
that I was worried

58:20.362 --> 58:21.796
about how stressed out
you are!

58:21.797 --> 58:23.531
And why am I
so stressed?

58:23.532 --> 58:27.368
Because I'm working my ass off
to keep the shit

58:27.369 --> 58:30.171
that we already have
because we're in debt!

58:30.172 --> 58:32.840
Because I'm the one fucking
person on this planet

58:32.841 --> 58:37.345
who doesn't rob and steal
and lie and cheat!!

58:37.346 --> 58:39.847
And for that,
I'm considered weak?!

58:39.848 --> 58:43.418
Okay, maybe you're so used to
being a victim, John,

58:43.419 --> 58:45.953
that you can't see when people
are genuinely trying

58:45.954 --> 58:47.322
to help you!

58:47.323 --> 58:48.356
You're crazy!

58:48.357 --> 58:49.507
Did I hurt
your feelings?

58:49.508 --> 58:51.042
Want to know
the truth?

58:51.043 --> 58:53.444
Rick's been trying to get me
to fuck around behind your back

58:53.445 --> 58:55.346
since the moment we met
and I didn't

58:55.347 --> 58:58.215
because I treat people
the way I want to be treated.

58:58.216 --> 59:00.785
And if I treated you
with the kind of disrespect

59:00.786 --> 59:03.387
that you've been treating me,
I hope to God

59:03.388 --> 59:05.706
that you'd throw my ass
over this fucking railing!

59:05.707 --> 59:10.161
Now I'm giving you 3 seconds to
get the fuck out of this house!

59:10.162 --> 59:11.963
One.

59:11.964 --> 59:13.965
(Wild applause)

59:20.790 --> 59:22.657
(Cheering)

59:38.090 --> 59:40.825
(Gunshots)

59:42.127 --> 59:43.144
(Gunshots)

59:48.600 --> 59:50.518
(Heart monitor
beeping)

01:00:08.253 --> 01:00:18.245
¶

01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:57.418
JOHN:
I see you.

01:02:04.569 --> 01:02:06.571
(Mouse squeaking)

01:02:50.181 --> 01:02:51.633
"Richard Vellum Carlson."

01:02:55.788 --> 01:02:57.789
Vellum Carlson.

01:03:06.198 --> 01:03:08.649
Fucking Carlson.

01:04:51.436 --> 01:04:53.237
(People approaching)

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:58.126
WOMAN:
Ha ha, very funny.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.735
What are you doing?

01:05:07.736 --> 01:05:09.770
What are you doing,
huh?

01:05:09.771 --> 01:05:12.506
Huh?

01:05:12.507 --> 01:05:15.310
You miss me already?

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.511
WOMAN:
Rick,
what are you doing?

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:19.513
Talking to
my other girlfriend.

01:06:40.262 --> 01:06:45.048
¶ Deep down in the mud
where the dead fuck ¶

01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:48.752
¶ I'm calling your name ¶

01:06:48.753 --> 01:06:53.624
¶ I bow my head to the ground
where my lips suck ¶

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:58.196
¶ Till our breath
is the same ¶

01:06:58.197 --> 01:07:01.498
¶ There's a moment
I'm crawling like an animal ¶

01:07:01.499 --> 01:07:06.670
¶ Something tells me
this is the time ¶

01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:11.309
¶ There's a moment
I'm crawling like an animal ¶

01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:16.447
¶ Will you come
for me? ¶

01:07:16.448 --> 01:07:18.449
(Laughing)

01:07:20.853 --> 01:07:22.620
What's so funny?

01:07:24.055 --> 01:07:26.557
Just looking
at all the drones, man.

01:07:27.593 --> 01:07:29.460
You know
what I'm saying?

01:07:29.461 --> 01:07:31.161
Not really.

01:07:31.162 --> 01:07:33.931
Then you yourself
are a drone.

01:07:33.932 --> 01:07:37.935
¶ I did my time ¶

01:07:37.936 --> 01:07:42.540
¶ I threw it away ¶

01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:48.278
¶ I followed the signs
so I could look in your eyes ¶

01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:51.148
Where have you been?

01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:53.150
Tara, my love.

01:07:54.419 --> 01:07:57.555
I haven't seen you
in almost two weeks.

01:07:57.556 --> 01:07:59.456
That's because
you never turn around.

01:07:59.457 --> 01:08:01.125
I've been following you.

01:08:01.126 --> 01:08:03.995
That's creepy.

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:05.863
That's creepy.

01:08:05.864 --> 01:08:07.932
Where's your friend?

01:08:07.933 --> 01:08:10.234
Rick?

01:08:10.235 --> 01:08:11.869
Yeah.

01:08:14.055 --> 01:08:17.140
Listen, I found out
some fucked-up shit about Rick.

01:08:20.295 --> 01:08:21.778
Can you keep a secret?

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:23.779
Yeah.

01:08:25.216 --> 01:08:27.084
You never messed around
with him, did you?

01:08:27.085 --> 01:08:29.386
No.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:35.892
I got a call from a girl
that Rick was with.

01:08:39.831 --> 01:08:41.365
Rick's HIV-positive.

01:08:43.901 --> 01:08:45.868
What?

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:48.037
I know,
it's terrible.

01:08:48.038 --> 01:08:49.439
Don't say anything.

01:08:49.441 --> 01:08:51.457
Of course not.
But, my God, Chrissie!

01:08:51.459 --> 01:08:54.495
She should know.

01:08:54.496 --> 01:08:56.964
Yeah, I'll...

01:08:56.965 --> 01:08:59.200
I'll tell her.

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.768
Is he okay?

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:02.770
He's so depressed.

01:09:04.973 --> 01:09:07.741
I know him though, he's going to
act like nothing's happening

01:09:07.742 --> 01:09:10.310
and keep spreading it
around.

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:15.448
I know, it's stupid but I went
out and got myself checked.

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:16.750
You're clean,
right?

01:09:16.751 --> 01:09:18.051
I'm clean
as a whistle.

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:21.572
I was just
freaked out.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.073
Yeah.

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:27.310
You want to go smoke?

01:09:27.312 --> 01:09:29.046
Yeah, let's smoke.

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:40.524
Hey.
Vellum.

01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:42.725
How's it going, Tara?
Good to see you.

01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:48.031
What was that?

01:09:48.032 --> 01:09:50.033
Who gives a fuck?

01:10:52.347 --> 01:11:02.356
¶

01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:33.837
¶

01:11:38.477 --> 01:11:42.113
¶ Time to kill ¶

01:11:42.114 --> 01:11:45.416
¶ Precious time ¶

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:55.325
¶

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.252
(Laughing)

01:12:05.253 --> 01:12:07.254
I'll call you.

01:12:23.955 --> 01:12:25.939
Ricky, boy.

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:27.508
You better take
the stairs.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.342
Don't be a dick,
John.

01:12:29.343 --> 01:12:31.211
Sorry, can't talk.

01:12:31.212 --> 01:12:33.213
Got to go job-hunting.

01:12:33.214 --> 01:12:34.748
I didn't do anything
against you.

01:12:34.749 --> 01:12:36.583
Oh, love and war.

01:12:36.584 --> 01:12:38.151
Dog eat dog.

01:12:38.152 --> 01:12:40.287
Business is business.

01:12:40.288 --> 01:12:42.255
I'll see you,
Vellum.

01:12:42.256 --> 01:12:44.607
Grow up,
cockhole.

01:13:02.744 --> 01:13:05.195
Hello.

01:13:05.196 --> 01:13:06.563
Hi.

01:13:06.564 --> 01:13:08.081
Is this--?

01:13:08.082 --> 01:13:11.135
Okay, sorry.
Thank you.

01:13:14.072 --> 01:13:15.406
Hello, is this...?

01:13:15.407 --> 01:13:16.991
Yeah, I heard you had
a job available?

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:18.275
Okay, sorry.

01:13:18.276 --> 01:13:19.509
Thank you.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.798
... and I heard that
there was a job.

01:13:24.799 --> 01:13:26.299
I'm a lawyer, okay?

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:29.303
I'm a lawyer, okay?

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.438
To be honest, I've had
problems of my own.

01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:35.809
I heard that you had
a job available?

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:38.312
... pretended to be my friend
and he had my fiancée betray me.

01:13:39.964 --> 01:13:42.716
... I'm sorry about that,
goodbye.

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:52.593
You ever hear
of knocking?

01:13:57.515 --> 01:14:00.083
I own half the stuff in this
place; I don't have to knock.

01:14:01.085 --> 01:14:04.121
Seattle, come here, boy!
Come here!

01:14:04.122 --> 01:14:06.123
Good boy.

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:19.903
So were you even
going to call me?

01:14:19.904 --> 01:14:21.872
Why don't you go
play with Rick?

01:14:32.216 --> 01:14:34.785
We've been together
3½ years, John.

01:14:34.786 --> 01:14:37.971
I think I deserve
a little better than this.

01:14:37.972 --> 01:14:39.222
You want
what you deserve?

01:14:39.223 --> 01:14:41.308
Just say the word
and I'll give it to you.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.676
Yes, is this --

01:14:59.677 --> 01:15:02.879
... I heard there was
this job.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.447
Okay, sorry.

01:15:17.929 --> 01:15:19.496
(Computer beeping)

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:46.039
Oh.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.974
Wow, Ricky, my boy.

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:01.071
(Muttering)

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.713
Shit.

01:16:35.957 --> 01:16:40.460
"Dear Ms. Craig...

01:16:43.882 --> 01:16:48.484
"Please use discretion

01:17:56.253 --> 01:17:58.321
(Giggling)

01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:03.277
(Laughing)

01:18:04.228 --> 01:18:05.679
"Dear Ms. Craig,

01:18:10.001 --> 01:18:12.969
And send.

01:18:20.077 --> 01:18:22.078
Time to celebrate.

01:18:44.652 --> 01:18:47.387
Hey, Tara,
it's John.

01:18:47.388 --> 01:18:49.389
Call me,
I want to see you tonight.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:44.378
RICK:
Will you just
listen to me? Stop!

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.979
No. You go get your fuckin'
dirty dick tested

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.015
and then I'll listen to you,
you fucking cocksucker!

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:50.667
Hey!

01:19:52.553 --> 01:19:54.554
What the fuck?

01:20:20.948 --> 01:20:22.815
(Barking)

01:20:27.388 --> 01:20:29.389
All right.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.345
All right

01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:39.983
(Barking)

01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:49.008
(Barking)

01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:58.151
All right, just a minute,
Seattle.

01:21:01.622 --> 01:21:02.989
RICK:
Told you
that was disgusting.

01:21:25.696 --> 01:21:27.364
You want to
fuck with me?

01:21:29.733 --> 01:21:31.868
Stay out of my life,
you fucking asshole!

01:21:34.838 --> 01:21:36.973
(Laughing)

01:21:36.974 --> 01:21:39.158
What, you find that
annoying?

01:21:39.159 --> 01:21:40.526
What did I do to you?

01:21:43.664 --> 01:21:46.800
You pretended
to be my friend.

01:21:48.052 --> 01:21:52.589
Fill my head with your
stupid, fucking shit!

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.459
Why don't you admit
you're a fucking liar!

01:21:58.278 --> 01:22:00.814
I was your friend,
you fucking pussy!

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.415
I told you to stand up
for yourself.

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:04.250
I told you you could do
whatever you want.

01:22:04.251 --> 01:22:06.486
This is
the real world, John.

01:22:13.293 --> 01:22:16.179
You fucking
disgust me!

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.232
I have lied to you,
John.

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:20.733
I never had
a prescription for meds

01:22:20.734 --> 01:22:23.303
or had trouble with
people disrespecting me

01:22:23.304 --> 01:22:25.071
because
I'm an individual.

01:22:25.072 --> 01:22:27.807
But I invested
in your weakness.

01:22:27.808 --> 01:22:30.743
I had to stoop
to your level

01:22:30.744 --> 01:22:34.181
just so I didn't go
fucking crazy.

01:22:39.771 --> 01:22:41.938
(Yelling)

01:22:55.202 --> 01:22:57.954
I trusted you,
man.

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:01.191
You got information
from my girlfriend

01:23:01.192 --> 01:23:03.626
that you used to get a job
that was rightfully mine.

01:23:03.627 --> 01:23:04.895
You're a parasite!

01:23:04.896 --> 01:23:06.546
You're a fucking
liar!

01:23:06.547 --> 01:23:08.431
All you do
is fucking suck!

01:23:08.432 --> 01:23:10.383
You fucking told Tara
I had AIDS!

01:23:10.384 --> 01:23:12.319
Because
you lied to me!

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.853
I lie
to make myself smaller.

01:23:13.854 --> 01:23:15.972
You lie
to make yourself bigger.

01:23:15.973 --> 01:23:18.191
Who is evolution
going to choose, John? Huh?

01:23:18.192 --> 01:23:19.659
You crippled a man,
Ricky.

01:23:21.061 --> 01:23:22.195
You crippled somebody.

01:23:22.196 --> 01:23:23.663
You don't know
anything about it.

01:23:23.664 --> 01:23:25.581
I know I never hurt
anybody like that.

01:23:25.582 --> 01:23:27.383
Andrew Jackson was
a lowlife fucking drug dealer

01:23:27.384 --> 01:23:28.835
who I was
buying Coke from

01:23:28.836 --> 01:23:32.622
and he hated me
because I'd always show up

01:23:32.623 --> 01:23:33.840
and I'd fuck around
with his friends.

01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:35.108
"Hey, what up,
nigga!"

01:23:35.109 --> 01:23:36.176
One day,
we got twisted.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.477
He reneged,
no pun intended.

01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:40.613
Shit got out of hand.
It happens every day.

01:23:40.614 --> 01:23:43.549
This is the real world, John.
No right or wrong.

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:46.319
You get
what you give.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.989
You know that little e-mail
you sent Ms. Craig?

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.258
Ms. Craig wants me to get a
restraining order against you.

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:53.526
Me, the bad guy,
needs protection

01:23:53.527 --> 01:23:55.862
from you,
the good guy.

01:23:55.863 --> 01:23:58.531
(Seattle barking)

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:02.202
Who is God
going to choose, John?

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.699
(Gunshot)

01:24:18.769 --> 01:24:22.689
SCOTTISH MAN:
Now let's just go over this
little paragraph here.

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:27.560
As I say, look at how this
is presented to the public.

01:24:29.179 --> 01:24:33.449
This is how they give their
statements to the world.

01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:39.321
Middle classes becoming
revolutionary...

01:24:41.809 --> 01:24:43.743
giving you fear...

01:24:46.196 --> 01:24:47.997
giving you
conclusions...

01:24:47.998 --> 01:24:49.900
fear...

01:24:49.901 --> 01:24:52.569

01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:55.004

01:24:55.005 --> 01:24:58.391
conclusion...
