WEBVTT

00:39.081 --> 00:40.790
Extreme close-up!

00:41.125 --> 00:48.005
Whoa!

00:48.632 --> 00:50.299
Okay. All right.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.594
All right. So, here we are
in our new surroundings,

00:53.679 --> 00:57.682
the abandoned Acme doll factory
in downtown Aurora, lllinois.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.143
We now have an official babe lair.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.520
l know, man.
This place is gonna be chick central.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.440
l feel sorry for guys who still have to
live with their parents, you know?

01:05.524 --> 01:09.110
Okay. You've probably noticed by now
that we're on a little early tonight.

01:09.194 --> 01:13.406
Usually at this time on Aurora Cable,
you're watching Plant World.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.783
But they didn't want our 10:30 time slot.

01:15.868 --> 01:20.121
But we were able to talk Plant World
into changing with Cooking World.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.582
Although, they didn't want to
change at first.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.752
But fortunately,
White Supremacy World was canceled,

01:25.836 --> 01:27.420
and all the trades worked out.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.756
And finally, the reason we're on early

01:29.840 --> 01:32.592
is because we're going
to a concert tonight in Chicago.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.510
-Excellent.
-Yes.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.930
And did l mention that we will be seeing

01:38.474 --> 01:40.057
-Aerosmith?
-Aerosmith.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.769
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

01:42.853 --> 01:46.355
All right, okay. So, until next week,
good night, and party on.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.524
-Party on, Wayne!
-Party on, Garth.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.818
lt's Wayne's World, Wayne's World

01:50.903 --> 01:53.154
Party time, excellent

01:56.909 --> 01:59.118
And we're out.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.621
-All right, okay!
-All right! Let's move, people!

02:01.705 --> 02:04.874
All right. Garth, to the Mirthmobile.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.042
The Mirthmobile!

02:15.886 --> 02:17.845
-All right.
-All right.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.649
Hi. l'm Wayne Campbell.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.983
Excellent.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.902
Welcome to Wayne's World 2.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.905
Let me bring you up to speed. Come on.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.245
There's a lot to tell you,
so let's take the scenic route.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.752
A year has passed.
l'm a little older. l'm a little wiser.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.506
l'm starting to get hair
in really weird places, man.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.425
l feel like l'm turning into Sasquatch.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.011
l still go out with
my girlfriend Cassandra.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.888
She's cutting a record demo
right now, man.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.307
Her career's really taking off.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.893
You remember Cassandra, don't you?

03:07.104 --> 03:08.104
Ah.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.022
Cassandra.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.317
Schwing !

03:13.527 --> 03:15.027
What a babe.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.071
She'd give a dog a bone.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.743
But, you know,
even though l live on my own now,

03:22.828 --> 03:26.372
everybody's really hassling me
to do something with my life, you know?

03:26.456 --> 03:28.207
To become an adult.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.336
l feel like l'm in a
John Hughes rite de passage movie.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.549
But what l'd really like to do
is something extraordinary,

03:36.633 --> 03:38.634
something big, something mega,

03:38.719 --> 03:42.221
something copious, something
capacious, something cajunga.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.598
But. . .

03:43.807 --> 03:46.475
l'll probably end up working
at Great America,

03:46.643 --> 03:48.978
mopping up hurl and lung butter.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.354
Yeah.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.444
Huh?

04:00.324 --> 04:03.367
You remember my best friend
Garth Algar, right?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.745
Oh, l almost forgot.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.623
This year, Garth finally got pubes.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.255
You didn't tell them about my pubes,
did you?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.591
No, of course not.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.433
You are listening to WPIG, The Pig,

04:27.517 --> 04:30.186
all rock, all the time.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.815
Hey, Handsome Dan coming at you

04:34.900 --> 04:36.734
at five on the short side
of nine bells here,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.820
from WPIG, America's rock authority

04:39.905 --> 04:42.865
What do you say
we check in with Mr. Scream?

04:57.005 --> 05:00.633
God, Handsome Dan is so cool.
He must get a million chicks.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.302
l bet he's totally studly and buffed.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.931
With a voice like that, man,
he's gotta be a babe magnet.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.694
Welcome to Mikita's.
How may I serve you?

05:21.279 --> 05:22.488
Yes.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.909
l'd. . .ike. . .rullers. . .urger. . .ox,
and a Mikita. . .cup.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.706
And then l think l would like

05:33.375 --> 05:37.420

05:37.754 --> 05:40.923

05:41.091 --> 05:42.842
-What?
-Oh, l'm sorry.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.927
And. . .peaker. . .oken.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.595
Oh, well, let me try to recap the order.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.930
A cruller, two Sugar Pucks,

05:48.015 --> 05:49.432
a Stanley Cup,
a large coffee with cream,

05:49.516 --> 05:51.225
a raspberry jelly donut, orange drink

05:51.309 --> 05:53.310
and a box of Five Holes.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.730
Yeah.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.107
Thank you. Drive around, please.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.743
l'm so psyched for this concert, man.
Aerosmith's gonna kick ass!

06:12.205 --> 06:15.124
But where are we
supposed to meet Cassandra?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.209
Cha-ching ! Cha-ching !

06:17.461 --> 06:18.627
Backstage laminates.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.087
Whoa!

06:31.808 --> 06:34.935
-Encore! Encore! Encore!
-Encore! Encore! Encore!

07:40.710 --> 07:42.086
Let's go.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.385
Garth ! Somebody just grabbed my butt!

07:50.554 --> 07:52.054
All right, we're on !

07:52.514 --> 07:54.014
l feel weird.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.398
lt's like 1 ,000 fingers
urging you to let go.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.984
l'm having fun.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.402
Excellent!

08:12.409 --> 08:13.409
Hold tight.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.088
You guys wail !

08:26.339 --> 08:28.924
-You guys rule, baby!
-Lunch is here!

08:30.760 --> 08:31.760
So do you !

08:34.806 --> 08:35.806
Goat is here.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.269
Coming by, man.
Excuse me! Excuse me.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.313
Where is the backstage area?

08:53.658 --> 08:55.659
Excuse us. Excuse me.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.918
Okay. Cool.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.927
Oh, there she is. Hey, Cassandra!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.471
Hey, Campbell !

09:20.185 --> 09:22.645
-Hey, Campbell !
-Hey, there she is.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.022
Sorry we couldn't sit together.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.816
Oh, no troubles, bubbles.
Great concert, huh?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.235
l want you to meet somebody.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.987
Wayne, Garth,
this is Bobby Cahn of Sharpe Records.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.072
Excellent.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.198
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.616
Bobby's my record producer.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.243
He's been working
with me and the band.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.662
Well, we must drop by the studio.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.040
Of course, l don't have to tell you
how extremely talented Cassandra is.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.875
l mean, you've heard,
you've seen, you know.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.086
Definitely. Scott! Scottie.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.048
l want you to meet someone.
Cassandra, this is Scott.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.843
-Dwayne.
-Actually, Wayne.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.928
All right.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.514
Bobby tells me you are very,
very talented.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.266
l was just saying the exact same thing.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.851
Scott, l wanna ask you something.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.482
Don't you hate schmoozing?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.901
Oh, yes. l just despise it.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.156
Stand back, please.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.456
-We're not worthy!
-We're not worthy!

10:24.541 --> 10:27.167
You're worthy, you're worthy. Get up.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.128
You guys were excellent tonight.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.130
Hey, thanks a lot. We'll see you inside.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.382
-We're planning on it.
-Hey, all right. All right.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.550
Whoa.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.264
-Excellent.
-Gotcha. Great.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.099
Hold on.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.518
Excuse me.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.853
Wow.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.734
Oh. . . Oh, jeez. Wayne, look.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.695
Garth, it's Heather Locklear.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.573
And she's signaling to us.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.366
There is a god.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.660
Heather be thy name.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.914
-Schwing.
-Schwing.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.043
-Bobby!
-Heather.

11:09.544 --> 11:12.254
-Are you coming?
-Oh, yeah, we're. . .

11:13.006 --> 11:14.548
-This is Cassandra.
-Hello.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.592
We're supposed to be in there.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.427
No, you're not.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.970
My girlfriend's in there.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.182
Hey, a lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.476
-Denied.
-Denied.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.041
Hi ! Where are you from?
l'm from Wilmette.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.461
l'm from Cicero.
lsn't it cool to be downtown?

11:53.046 --> 11:56.215
Hey, are you those two guys
who have that TV show in Aurora?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.926
-Wayne's World? Wayne's World.
-Wayne's World. Party time.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.135
No!

12:01.554 --> 12:03.013
Oh. You guys sure look like them.

12:03.098 --> 12:06.058
Look, if Wayne says we're not,
we're not, okay?

12:06.184 --> 12:07.351
Okay.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.270
How long does it take
for you to get here from Aurora?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.564
lt takes me 40 minutes door to door.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.233
My ma gave me a dollar

12:14.317 --> 12:16.402
and dropped me off
at the park-and-ride.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.077
Dogs. Dogs.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.289
And Marilyn.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.083
Marilyn. . .

12:32.710 --> 12:34.378
lt's all a creature.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.255
Let's all look at your. . .

13:26.431 --> 13:27.848
Who are you?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.683
l'm Jim Morrison.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.059
Cool.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.728
Who's he?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.147
A weird naked lndian.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.316
Cool.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.403
Why have you brought me here?

13:41.696 --> 13:44.323
To help you find some answers, Wayne.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.158
Answers to what?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.409
Ask me a question.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.412
Okay. Two trains
are traveling at 60 miles an hour,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.164
one from Chicago,
one from Los Angeles. . .

13:52.248 --> 13:55.000
No, ask me a question about your life.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.587
What am l supposed to do with my life?

13:59.506 --> 14:02.424
You should put on a concert
in Aurora, Wayne.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.302
How am l gonna get the bands to come?

14:05.386 --> 14:07.888
lf you book them, they will come.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.600
But l don't know anything
about putting on a concert.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.895
You must go to England
and find a man named Del Preston.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.355
He's the greatest roadie that ever lived.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.274
He was with us
in the good times and the bad.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.360
He will help you.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.278
Any more questions?

14:23.446 --> 14:27.074
Will Garth ever get
his Sports Illustrated football phone?

14:27.158 --> 14:28.867
lt was sent to the wrong house.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.663
lt will arrive tomorrow, along with
the swimsuit issue and the video,

14:32.747 --> 14:35.082
Stanley Cup, 100 Years of Glory.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.462
Hey, how do l get back?

14:40.713 --> 14:43.131
Follow the weird naked lndian.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.633
Cool.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.261
Wake up, Wayne!

14:48.972 --> 14:50.430
Garth.

14:50.515 --> 14:54.101
l just had the most vivid
and powerful dream of my life.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.312
Last night, Jim Morrison spoke to me.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.191
He told me that the purpose of my life
was to put on a concert.

15:01.818 --> 15:02.818
Yeah.

15:03.486 --> 15:07.823
Oh, hey, guess what finally
came in the mail, Wayne?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.576
l guess they sent it to the wrong house.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.328
My Sports Illustrated football phone.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.746
Oh, my God !

15:14.831 --> 15:18.625
Cool. My Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.670
Oh, my God.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.799
And The History of the Stanley Cup,
100 Years of Glory.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.176
Garth, it's a sign.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.014
We will put on a concert.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.640
Oh, yes.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.560
We will put on a concert.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.201
Well, this must be the place.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.413
Maybe we should've called Cassandra
before we dropped by.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.832
Garth, it's us.
No one's gonna hassle us.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.044
Besides, Cassandra needs
the encouragement.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.636
Excuse me, what are you guys
doing here in the middle of the street?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.805
Well, l'm putting these chickens
in crates and stacking them right here.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.600
Jim's job is to make sure
we always have plenty of watermelons.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.644
Oh, so you're selling watermelons.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.270
No, no, sir. We just gotta make sure

16:20.355 --> 16:21.605
there's plenty of them stacked
at all times,

16:21.689 --> 16:22.731
just like the chickens.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.024
What do these guys do?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.942
Well, their job is to walk back and forth

16:26.027 --> 16:28.987
with this big plate-glass window
every couple of minutes.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.531
That's weird.

16:31.741 --> 16:35.285
Yeah. You gotta wonder
if this is gonna pay off later on.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.677
Okay.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.012
Maybe we ought to overdub a track
with Bobby playing.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.847
He can really wail.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.684
Give them a few minutes.
They're working on it.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.227
l spoke with the label today.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.021
They figure you got
at least three singles on this one.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.190
They want you to come out
to the Coast next week.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.483
Excellent.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.444
Not bad for a little girl from Hong Kong.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.077
What brings you here, Wayne?

17:17.161 --> 17:19.621
l had to tell Cassandra something.

17:20.455 --> 17:21.873
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.377
Last night l had a dream.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.213
We're going to put on
a concert in Aurora.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.631
That's a great idea.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.426
Yeah. lt's. . . lt's a festival.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.845
-A festival?
-A festival. You heard the man.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.097
That's charming. What's it called?

17:37.181 --> 17:38.682
What's it called?

17:38.766 --> 17:44.855
lt's called. . .

17:46.232 --> 17:47.941
Waynestock. lt's called Waynestock.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.401
Waynestock.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.195
Who's gonna be at Waynestock?

17:55.366 --> 17:57.325
Aerosmith and Pearl Jam.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.704
Who else?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.458
Me

18:04.625 --> 18:06.168
and Wayne.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.755
-And. . .
-And. . .

18:12.341 --> 18:13.759
Van Halen.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.677
Wow! Van Halen. Who else?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.304
Yeah. Who else?

18:18.639 --> 18:22.350
An old man fashioning a kayak
out of a log?

18:23.478 --> 18:24.728
-What?
-No!

18:26.355 --> 18:28.565
Rip Taylor! Rip Taylor's gonna be there.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.193
Rip Taylor? He's a god in my country.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.903
He can't walk the streets
without getting mobbed.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.405
Well, that's great,
'cause he's gonna be there. So. . .

18:35.490 --> 18:38.116
And l thought maybe
you could play, too.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.576
l would be honored.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.453
l wouldn't commit just yet.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.955
You got some real gigs coming up.
Real gigs.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.373
Real gigs?

18:45.958 --> 18:49.586
Well, ixnay
on the condescension-ay there, Chet.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.171
Yeah.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.883
-Bobby, can l ask you a question?
-What is it, Garth?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.053
A sphincter says what?

19:00.765 --> 19:05.060
l said, "A sphincter says what?"

19:06.604 --> 19:10.315
You want me to say "what,"
like l don't get it.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.733
ls that it?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.571
That it?

19:16.697 --> 19:18.698
Oh, dear. Last guy didn't get.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.450
-What.
-Okay. Last guy didn't get.

19:20.535 --> 19:21.618
You big. You big.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.956
We small, small.
So, we better go. Yeah.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.165
Where are you going?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.333
-England !
-England !

19:28.960 --> 19:32.462
I can't believe Paramount is spending
the money to fly us to England.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.257
I would have thought
they would just use two doubles.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.093
Here we are at Piccadilly Circus.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.762
Wow! What a shitty circus.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.265
Good call.
There's no animals or clowns.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.516
What a rip-off.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.893
Let's go to Buckingham Palace.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.438
Does Princess Di still live here?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.107
She is such a babe.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.275
Yeah.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.784
So, did Jim Morrison
give you Del Preston's exact address?

20:03.244 --> 20:05.829
Yeah. He said exactly London, England.

20:05.955 --> 20:06.997
Okay.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.963
l don't know about this, Wayne.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.724
Del?

20:27.476 --> 20:28.643
Hello?

20:29.770 --> 20:30.812
Del?

20:42.325 --> 20:43.992
Are you Del Preston?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.327
l might be.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.037
Who are you?

20:47.121 --> 20:49.581
-My name is Wayne Campbell.
-l'm Garth Algar.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.833
That's terribly fascinating, mate,

20:52.501 --> 20:53.668
but you woke me up.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.879
How can you sleep like that?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.631
Listen, sonny, Jim,

20:58.341 --> 21:01.760
sleeping like this
will add 1 0 years to your life.

21:06.057 --> 21:10.018
l learned it from Keith Richards
when l toured with the Stones.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.275
This may be the reason why

21:17.360 --> 21:20.695
Keith cannot be killed
by conventional weapons.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.824
So, how can l be of assistance?

21:25.368 --> 21:27.494
You're gonna think l'm nuts, right,

21:27.912 --> 21:32.123
but someone visited me in a dream
and told me that Del Preston

21:32.208 --> 21:35.043
would help me put on a concert
in Aurora, lllinois.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.461
A concert?

21:39.256 --> 21:41.424
l'm afraid you've been misinformed.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.761
l don't do that anymore.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.683
l'm just an old geezer.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.185
l mean, what do l know
about music today?

21:52.395 --> 21:53.979
When l was working, it was all bands

21:54.063 --> 21:57.065
like Eric Clapton
and the Rolling Stones.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.652
l mean, it's not like the Grateful Dead
are still together and touring, is it?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.446
-Well, actually, they. . .
-Garth.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.076
Wow, look at this scrapbook.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.160
Wow.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.872
-That's you with Led Zeppelin.
-Yeah.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.792
My old lady put that together.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.420
We must've toured every concert hall
and venue in America,

22:18.504 --> 22:21.756
me, my old lady and the road.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.009
-ls that you and Bob Dylan?
-Yeah.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.802
Who's the old lady?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.429
That's my old lady.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.390
Listen, it was fun,

22:30.975 --> 22:33.018
but those days are gone forever.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.688
But we came all the way from America
just to talk to you.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.023
l'm sorry.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.275
l don't do concerts anymore.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.360
Come on, let's go.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.114
Well,

22:46.699 --> 22:50.452
l still think you led a really cool life.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.455
lt was nice meeting you.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.415
l guess Jim was wrong.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.502
Hang about.

23:01.756 --> 23:04.049
Was it Jim Morrison?

23:04.258 --> 23:05.759
-Yes!
-Amazing.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.636
Did he have a naked lndian?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.138
-Yes!
-Wow .

23:10.306 --> 23:12.098
l have to ask you. . .

23:13.142 --> 23:15.268
Didn't you think it was
a trifle unnecessary

23:15.352 --> 23:17.812
to see the crack in the lndian's bottom?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.606
Yes, absolutely!

23:20.107 --> 23:21.649
l had the same dream.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.819
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

23:25.988 --> 23:28.531
Del, you're really gonna love Aurora.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.492
Who's Aurora, anyway?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.952
Frank, it's Bobby.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.830
Did you get the tape?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.832
What did you think?

23:38.334 --> 23:40.543
Definitely. She sounds great.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.463
Yeah, the band is terrible.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.006
lt's a garage band.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.592
They can't, l'm sure.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.639
l'm working with them.
l'm still in this studio in Aurora.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.182
What the hell you doing there?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.517
She wants to stay here.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.227
Why would she wanna stay in Aurora?

23:57.311 --> 23:59.062
Same reason
they all wanna stay in Aurora,

23:59.146 --> 24:00.688
she's got a boyfriend.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.525
Don't worry.
l'll get rid of the boyfriend and the band.

24:03.609 --> 24:07.153
Also, l'd like to bring her out to LA,
finish the album.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.781
All right, Bobby.
Let's just get it done, okay?

24:14.870 --> 24:18.998
And there l am in Sri Lanka,
formerly Ceylon, at 3:00 in the morning,

24:19.083 --> 24:23.378
looking for 1 ,000 brown M&Ms
to fill a brandy glass,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.381
or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.634
So, Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

24:29.718 --> 24:32.762
and mentions there's a little sweet shop
on the edge of town.

24:32.847 --> 24:36.391
So, we go, and it's closed.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.394
So, there's me and Keith Moon
and David Crosby

24:39.478 --> 24:42.397
breaking into this
little sweet shop, right?

24:42.690 --> 24:45.066
Well, instead of a guard dog,

24:45.192 --> 24:49.529
they've got this bloody
great big Bengal tiger.

24:50.322 --> 24:54.409
Well, l managed to take out the tiger
with a can of Mace,

24:54.785 --> 24:56.661
but the shop owner and his son,

24:56.745 --> 24:59.247
that's a different story altogether.

25:00.249 --> 25:03.877
l had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.131
Nasty business, really.

25:08.424 --> 25:12.802
But sure enough, l got the M&Ms,
and Ozzy went on stage

25:12.887 --> 25:14.804
and did a great show.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.348
Wow! Wow, that was excellent.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.601
That's great.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.478
Well, to put on a really great rock show

25:22.771 --> 25:24.772
like Knebworth, in England,

25:25.691 --> 25:27.025
or Woodstock,

25:27.109 --> 25:29.736
there is only one place you can do it,

25:29.862 --> 25:31.196
and that's here,

25:31.614 --> 25:35.950
at Adlai Stevenson Memorial Park,
in the playing fields.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.912
We better get to Stevenson Park
and check it out.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.293
So, Wayne. . .

25:46.629 --> 25:49.547
l hear you're putting on
some kind of concert.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.049
That's good.

25:51.467 --> 25:55.011
People need to be entertained.
They need the distraction.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.804
l wish to God
that somebody would do something

25:56.889 --> 25:59.432
to block out the voices in my head
for five minutes,

25:59.516 --> 26:01.935
voices that scream over and over,

26:02.019 --> 26:06.522
"Why do they come to me to die?"

26:07.024 --> 26:08.149
Okay.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.125
What do we do now?

26:26.210 --> 26:28.336
Here. Let me look at it.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.383
Get the flashlight.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.011
Okay.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.347
There's the main gate,

26:39.431 --> 26:41.307
and here we are.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.559
No, no, no, man. We're over here.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.562
l don't think so.
We took a left turn at the gate,

26:46.647 --> 26:49.190
-so that would put us. . .
-Garth !

26:49.692 --> 26:51.192
Wait a minute.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.361
l know where we are.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.571
l'm pretty good with maps.

26:59.410 --> 27:00.451
Listen.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.869
What?

27:08.377 --> 27:09.752
Turn it off! Turn it off!

27:09.837 --> 27:13.131
-l can't turn it off! l can't turn it off!
-Turn it off! Turn it off!

27:20.597 --> 27:21.973
Waynestock?

27:22.349 --> 27:25.018
You would purposely invite

27:25.102 --> 27:27.812
the rock 'n' roll element
into our community?

27:28.188 --> 27:30.565
Well, what's wrong with
a little entertainment?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.359
Entertainment is fine, but this. . .

27:34.361 --> 27:37.071
You know, we have lots of big acts
that come through here.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.408
lce Capades, Tiny Toons, Kenny G.

27:40.826 --> 27:41.909
Kenny G?

27:56.091 --> 27:59.719
So, what, we don't even get
to apply for a permit? Yeah.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.555
We would love to put on a rock concert.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.182
Not!

28:07.353 --> 28:08.436
Yeah.

28:08.562 --> 28:13.191
Betty Jo, could we have the permits
for a festival, please?

28:13.817 --> 28:15.234
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.613
You'll need to fill out
the necessary permit applications.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.492
Permit applications.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.952
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Betty Jo.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.457
Hey.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.795
You're the guy that's on that
Wayne World show.

28:34.505 --> 28:35.838
-Betty Jo?
-Yeah?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.256
Thank you.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.888
All right, then.

28:44.264 --> 28:48.393
Naturally, you'll need the
necessary application for authorization,

28:48.644 --> 28:51.145
approval from the guilds and unions.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.773
You'll need some release forms.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.650
The decibel level. . .

28:55.901 --> 28:57.902
What? ls something wrong?

28:58.487 --> 28:59.529
Huh?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.698
What do you mean?

29:03.158 --> 29:04.700
lt's my eye, isn't it?

29:04.785 --> 29:07.286
Why would we want to look at your eye?

29:07.371 --> 29:10.748
ls there something wrong
with that weird eye?

29:11.333 --> 29:13.251
There's nothing wrong with my eye.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.752
This one just has no pigment.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.839
You see, l'm what you call
a partial ocular albino.

29:17.923 --> 29:18.965
But l'm fine with it.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.884
l have perfect 20/20 vision
with both eyes.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.430
Mr. Campbell, you're serious about
putting on a rock concert?

29:25.514 --> 29:28.182
Are you kidding? l'd give my right eye.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.685
Yeah.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.478
You both realize

29:32.563 --> 29:34.939
there are certain jurisdictions
you'll need to follow.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.526
Well, l'd like to think
that l have an eye for details.

29:41.947 --> 29:47.201
l'm assuming, of course,
you have the $5,000 occupancy permit,

29:47.286 --> 29:48.661
or you wouldn't even be here.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.955
Ex-squeeze me? A baking powder?

29:51.039 --> 29:53.416
$5,000 occupancy permit?

29:54.251 --> 29:56.377
Yes, we have that, actually. Yes.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.004
Piece of cake.

29:58.088 --> 30:01.466
Fine, then all forms and applications
must be filled out in triplicate

30:01.550 --> 30:02.758
and returned to this office

30:02.843 --> 30:06.095
no later than 1 0 working days
before the event,

30:06.597 --> 30:07.805
with the money.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.974
Okay. Well, we'll take these home,

30:10.142 --> 30:12.143
run through them
with a fine-tooth comb,

30:12.227 --> 30:14.437
cross the "t's" and dot the. . .

30:18.066 --> 30:19.692
Lower-case "j's."

30:26.658 --> 30:28.868
Oh, l keep falling over. Oh, no!

30:28.952 --> 30:31.412
-Oh, l seem to be falling over a lot.
-Stop.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.081
Oh, damn, these high heels. Oh !

30:35.667 --> 30:37.084
Cassandra. . .

30:40.255 --> 30:42.048
Why do you go out with me?

30:42.132 --> 30:44.008
l love being with you.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.010
Most guys are jerks.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.304
You're a good person.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.517
Wait. Let me show you
what l got at a garage sale.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.976
What did you get?

30:54.311 --> 30:56.521
lsn't that great? You heard of it?

30:56.605 --> 30:58.689
Ex-squeeze me?
Have l ever seen this one before?

30:58.774 --> 31:00.024
Frampton Comes Alive?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.610
Everybody in the world
has Frampton Comes Alive.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.904
lf you lived in the suburbs,
you were issued it.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.532
lt came in the mail
with samples of Tide.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.368
Look at this old one.
Gerry and the Pacemakers.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.536
Wow! That is old.

31:11.620 --> 31:15.081
You know, l bet those guys
actually have pacemakers by now.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.251
Can you believe
they're not making vinyl anymore?

31:18.335 --> 31:20.294
-lt's weird, isn't it?
-That is weird.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.880
Bobby said my album will never,
ever be on vinyl.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.799
Oh, "Bobby says."

31:25.467 --> 31:27.051
Are you and Bobby having an affair?

31:27.135 --> 31:29.762
No, of course not.
Where did you hear that?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.847
Well, you know how these things start.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.433
One guy tells another guy something,

31:34.518 --> 31:36.519
then he tells two friends,

31:36.812 --> 31:38.396
and they tell two friends,

31:38.480 --> 31:40.106
and they tell their friends,

31:40.190 --> 31:42.233
and so on, and so on,

31:42.317 --> 31:43.609
and so on.

31:43.694 --> 31:44.902
You know how these things go.

31:44.987 --> 31:48.155
No. Honestly, Campbell,
l am not having an affair.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.616
l'm nice to him
because he's my producer.

31:50.701 --> 31:51.993
But if this record deal falls through,

31:52.077 --> 31:55.538
l lose my visa, and then
l have to go back to Hong Kong.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.415
But you have
nothing to worry about, Wayne.

31:57.499 --> 32:00.501
-Okay.
-Hey, my dad's coming to visit.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.919
l'd really love you to meet him.

32:02.004 --> 32:05.047
Yeah. Treat.
l'm sure he's just gonna love me.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.340
Yeah.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.052
lf you're anything like my old boyfriend.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.306
l'm nothing like your old boyfriend.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.141
Then we're screwed.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.269
You know, l haven't seen Garth
in a while. What's he up to?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.396
Oh, Garth's doing his laundry.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.940
Too bad he doesn't
have a girlfriend to do his laundry.

32:23.025 --> 32:26.402
Oh, yeah. Thanks for doing my laundry.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.903
Hey, Cassandra,

32:27.988 --> 32:30.615
how do you get my clothes
so white and fresh-smelling?

32:30.699 --> 32:34.035
lt's an age-old Cantonese family method
that very few people know about.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.245
Ah. Wait a minute.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.789
Calgon?

32:38.874 --> 32:41.208
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

33:06.026 --> 33:07.193
Hello.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.570
Hi.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.032
l don't recall ever seeing you in here.

33:13.116 --> 33:16.118
Well, maybe it's because
it's my first time in here.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.829
That's right.
My mom used to do all my laundry,

33:18.914 --> 33:20.164
but l do now.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.917
l'm what you call sans parents.

33:23.377 --> 33:24.502
Oh.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.880
l can go to a movie on a school night,
like that.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.968
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.348
Oh.

33:37.933 --> 33:38.933
Yeah, dirty. . .

33:39.518 --> 33:42.436
Would you like
some red rope licorice?

33:42.771 --> 33:44.105
Why, sure.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.828
-What's your name?
-Garth. Garth Algar.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.788
What's yours?

34:02.207 --> 34:04.041
l'm Honey Hornee.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.960
Nice to meet you, Miss Horny.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.169
That's Hornee.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.422
-lt's French.
-Oh. Okay,

34:10.632 --> 34:12.800
Miss Hornee.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.261
So, Garth,

34:16.138 --> 34:17.804
would you
like to have dinner some night?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.681
Oh, l like to have dinner every night.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.309
No, l mean us. You and me.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.812
Would you like
to have dinner some night?

34:26.815 --> 34:28.023
A date?

34:31.360 --> 34:33.821
Finally. lt took, like, two hours.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.091
l like them teeny and toasty.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.177
So long.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.388
-Bye.
-Bye.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.433
Maybe we'll see each other around.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.018
Yeah. l'll see you around.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.436
Oh, Garth?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.023
You forgot these.

35:21.703 --> 35:22.787
-Good night, Cassandra.
-Night.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.789
-Good work.
-Thanks. See you tomorrow.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.248
Good night.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.252
l have got to get you to LA.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.421
You are buried here.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.883
l like it here. All my friends are here.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.384
What time is it?

35:37.886 --> 35:39.178
1 0:35.

35:39.346 --> 35:42.056
Damn. l missed the start
of Wayne's show.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.517
Okay.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.977
So, we're in a doll factory, right?

35:47.062 --> 35:49.480
lt kind of reminds me of that movie,
the Leprechaun. You remember.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.564
-With that little guy..
-Oh, yeah.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.983
-...that goes, "I'm the leprechaun. "
-Jeez.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.361
Garth, I'm the leprechaun!

35:55.445 --> 35:56.570
Cool it, okay?

35:56.655 --> 35:59.824
-I'm the leprechaun!
-Stop it, all right?

35:59.908 --> 36:02.493
Don't try and steal me pot o' gold.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.495
Why do you hang around
with these guys?

36:04.579 --> 36:06.330
Because they're fun.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.499
lf l wanted a guy
that was all drive and ambition,

36:08.583 --> 36:10.251
l could've stayed in Hong Kong.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.628
Back there,
guys like that are 1 2 for 1 0 cents.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.004
You mean a dime a dozen.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.714
Maybe where you shop.

36:15.799 --> 36:18.843
l think you underestimate them.
They're really sharp.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.386
Stop it, leprechaun man!

36:20.470 --> 36:21.762
-Garth, chill!
-And there they come...

36:21.847 --> 36:23.514
-What did those monsters do to you?
-Heather Locklear...

36:23.598 --> 36:26.058
-I'm not... Stop it.
-Sweetie. Sweetie.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.643
-Stop it.
-Sweetie.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.520
-I'm not listening.
-Come on, sweetie.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.397
Come on. Pixie dust.

36:31.648 --> 36:34.191
Pixie dust. Sweetie, it's me.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.236
-It's me the leprechaun!
-No!

36:37.320 --> 36:39.196
I'm the leprechaun.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.615
Oh, yeah. These guys, really sharp.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.909
-I'm scared!
-It's the leprechaun.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.203
-Want to leave, but can't.
-I'm the leprechaun.

36:46.288 --> 36:47.997
-Want to move.
-Where you gonna move?

36:48.081 --> 36:50.499
-Get away, leprechaun man.
-Are you gonna move to Ireland?

36:50.584 --> 36:52.668
-No! Got to go!
-'Cause I'm the leprechaun.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.880
Wayne, we're here!

36:58.258 --> 37:00.384
Here, let me get the gate for you.
Hold on.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.886
All righty.

37:02.512 --> 37:03.971
Come on in.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.391
Come on in. Nice digs, huh?

37:09.185 --> 37:11.478
Hey, Cassandra, you look hot.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.398
Sorry.

37:14.816 --> 37:18.903
Wayne, l would like you to
meet my father, Mr. Wong.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.573
Please meet you acquaintance,
Wayne Campbell.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.544
Right.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.832
Very well, if that is your custom.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.376
Prepare to die.

38:16.753 --> 38:17.920
Come.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.233
l know all seven animal styles,

38:39.317 --> 38:40.484
the crane,

38:40.568 --> 38:41.694
the stag,

38:41.778 --> 38:43.487
the horse, the tiger,

38:43.571 --> 38:45.406
the bat, the rat,

38:45.490 --> 38:46.657
the monkey,

38:46.741 --> 38:47.950
the Beatle.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.494
l will take you, old man.

39:43.465 --> 39:46.175
Your tongue is quick,
but how are you with a sword?

39:46.259 --> 39:47.384
Oh, no!

39:47.469 --> 39:48.802
Wayne!

40:26.674 --> 40:28.592
Hello? Can we talk later?

40:28.676 --> 40:29.885
This is not a good time for me.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.221
Just a moment. l've got call waiting.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.473
Hello. Yes?

40:34.557 --> 40:37.059
Can l call you back?
l am on the other line.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.020
Uh-huh. Yes,

40:40.188 --> 40:43.023
he received his Sports Illustrated
football phone.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.840
Wayne, you've impressed me.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.925
You're worthy of my daughter.

41:16.224 --> 41:19.017
So, here's the deal.
We got a party tomorrow at Komrades.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.603
It's kind of a fund-raiser
for Waynestock.

41:21.688 --> 41:25.065
That's right. There's gonna be
a $10 cover charge at the door.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.650
It's gonna be a big party

41:26.734 --> 41:30.154
And because it's at Komrades,
we're gonna call it a communist party

41:38.872 --> 41:41.915
l remember, one time
l was in a place like this.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.752
Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.921
lt was about 3:00 in the morning,

41:48.006 --> 41:50.841
and l was looking for 1 ,000 brown M&Ms

41:50.925 --> 41:52.509
to fill a brandy glass,

41:52.594 --> 41:55.304
or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.515
So, Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

41:58.600 --> 42:00.184
and mentions there's a little

42:00.268 --> 42:02.311
-sweet shop on the edge of town.
-Sweet shop on the edge of town.

42:02.395 --> 42:03.854
-Yeah.
-Hey, Wayne. Hey, Garth.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.023
-Hey, Milton.
-Hey, Milton, how's it going, man?

42:06.107 --> 42:07.733
Awesome party!

42:08.443 --> 42:10.944
Good tunes. Good brew. Good buddies.

42:11.112 --> 42:12.696
l feel great, man.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.031
l feel great!

42:14.449 --> 42:15.616
l don't know, man.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.202
l hate my father. l hate my life.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.078
But l feel great, man !

42:20.455 --> 42:21.663
You guys are great.

42:21.748 --> 42:22.956
Yeah.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.626
l'm gonna go pick a fight.

42:27.921 --> 42:29.880
He's gotten a lot better, don't you think?

42:29.964 --> 42:31.798
-Way better.
-Yeah.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.635
Thank you.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.304
We'll be back in a bit.

42:42.435 --> 42:43.894
Hey, how's it going?

42:43.978 --> 42:45.187
-Hi.
-Hey.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.649
-lt's looking good, Campbell.
-Yeah.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.776
-l'll be at the bar.
-Good.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.069
Hey, l'm so glad you could make it.

42:52.153 --> 42:53.528
You look amazing.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.030
l see.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.658
-Yes.
-Oh, wait. l have great news.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.577
Bobby is taking me to LA
to do the final mix on my album.

43:00.662 --> 43:02.287
lsn't that terrific?

43:02.372 --> 43:04.581
Wow, that's great.

43:05.500 --> 43:06.833
l'm ecstatic.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.044
l'm beside myself with joy.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.671
Hooray for Hollywood.

43:10.755 --> 43:13.257
Living on your own
definitely has its perks. Schwing !

43:13.341 --> 43:15.634
You know, because your mom
doesn't tell you to turn down the stereo,

43:15.718 --> 43:17.761
and junk like that,
you know, which is a real drag.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.096
Schwing ! Schwing !

43:19.180 --> 43:20.806
You know, because moms
are genetically programed

43:20.890 --> 43:23.475
to hate music played at the
appropriate level, right? l mean. . .

43:23.559 --> 43:26.270
And my dad, forget about it.
Schwing ! Schwing ! Schwing ! Schwing !

43:26.354 --> 43:28.939
He could ruin a Led Zeppelin reunion
concert. You know what l mean?

43:29.023 --> 43:29.982
Schwing ! Schwing !

43:30.066 --> 43:32.234
'Cause he hates any music
played at the appropriate level.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.568
Schwing ! Schwing ! Schwing !

43:33.653 --> 43:35.862
. . .but the shopkeeper and his son

43:36.281 --> 43:38.740
was a different story altogether.

43:39.867 --> 43:43.704
l had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

43:46.249 --> 43:48.417
-What's the deal with Bobby?
-Wayne?

43:48.626 --> 43:51.044
-Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

43:51.212 --> 43:54.006
lt's getting a little out of hand.
l think you'd better say something.

43:54.090 --> 43:55.215
All right. Good call.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.759
Everybody, l'd like to say something !

43:57.844 --> 43:59.261
Excuse me. Coming through !

43:59.345 --> 44:02.806
Everybody, can l get your attention?
l'd like to say something.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.433
Keep it down.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.811
Okay. We're really glad
you could all make it.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.315
We never realized
that we had so many friends

44:11.399 --> 44:13.859
who believed in this concert idea.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.862
When we first had this idea
of putting on this shindig,

44:16.946 --> 44:19.448
we didn't know if anyone would come.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.907
But look,

44:21.367 --> 44:23.577
you're all here, pitching in.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.289
l promised myself l wouldn't cry.

44:32.587 --> 44:33.879
Party on !

44:38.384 --> 44:40.844
-Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

45:23.471 --> 45:26.515
Garth, l'm starting
to get a bad feeling, man.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.850
l think something's going on.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.240
Hello. Hello. Yes?

45:43.783 --> 45:45.867
ls this Aerosmith's tour manager?

45:45.952 --> 45:47.119
lt is!

45:47.578 --> 45:50.747
Hello. My name is Wayne Campbell.
You don't know me.

45:50.832 --> 45:52.249
l'm not mental or anything,

45:52.333 --> 45:55.210
but l'm putting on a concert
in Aurora, lllinois.

45:56.045 --> 45:57.671
Yes, l can hold.

45:58.673 --> 46:01.842
Del, look. For years l thought
this was a Mercedes emblem.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.385
Woodstock?

46:03.928 --> 46:05.512
That was quite a show, man.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.180
You were at Woodstock?

46:07.265 --> 46:09.349
Excellent. What was it like?

46:09.809 --> 46:14.479
Well, it rained all morning,
and then it cleared up in the afternoon.

46:15.982 --> 46:17.023
And that's it.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.734
l almost remembered
something else then, but it's gone.

46:19.819 --> 46:21.194
You can't remember what it was?

46:21.279 --> 46:23.697
Still holding, yes, l am. l just want. . .

46:24.490 --> 46:27.033
Wayne, look what l made.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.077
Good work, my friend.

46:32.415 --> 46:35.041
You guys got the permit applications?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.044
Got the money?

46:38.129 --> 46:39.713
Cha-ching, cha-ching.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.256
Good for you.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.218
Most people just take them
and never come back.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.909
Position one to position two.
Do you copy?

47:10.161 --> 47:11.953
This is position two in position.

47:12.038 --> 47:13.872
Position three, what's your position?

47:13.956 --> 47:15.749
Position three. l read you.

47:16.292 --> 47:18.293
Position four, do you copy? Over.

47:18.377 --> 47:19.753
Four copies.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.338
Back to position one. Over.

47:21.422 --> 47:24.466
l have to go to LA for a couple of days.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.259
lf you need anything,

47:28.262 --> 47:29.763
l'm at this number.

47:37.813 --> 47:39.272
Position one to position two.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.358
Position one to position two.
Did you see that?

47:41.442 --> 47:43.818
This is position two in position !

47:44.111 --> 47:46.446
Sorry, man, l didn't see anything.

47:49.617 --> 47:50.784
What is it?

47:54.830 --> 47:57.666
Abort! Abort! We have been identified !

48:01.671 --> 48:04.965
Abandon positions!
Abandon positions! Whoa!

48:08.636 --> 48:10.512
Wayne, let's run away!

48:34.495 --> 48:35.996
Garth, it's locked !

48:37.248 --> 48:38.498
ln here!

49:12.325 --> 49:13.366
Hi.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.125
Come on, let's go!

49:45.858 --> 49:48.318
Do it, Miss Thing ! Do it! Do it!

50:18.432 --> 50:20.517
Get it, girl ! Get it, girl !

51:21.912 --> 51:25.832
What's the matter, Wayne? You look
like you wanna say something to me.

51:27.334 --> 51:28.668
l think we should break up.

51:28.753 --> 51:31.755
-What? Why?
-Because

51:32.298 --> 51:33.965
there comes a time

51:34.175 --> 51:36.009
when people should go
their separate ways.

51:36.218 --> 51:39.137
l mean, l've got Waynestock,

51:39.221 --> 51:42.432
you've got your career
and your producer,

51:43.350 --> 51:48.104
and l just think it's time
that we should see other people.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.525
l don't want to see other people.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.068
Well, what about Bobby?

51:54.153 --> 51:56.613
-What about him?
-Oh, come on !

51:56.697 --> 51:58.448
Do you think l'm a gulla bull

51:58.532 --> 52:00.325
or even a gulla calf?

52:00.534 --> 52:02.577
l have no idea
what you're talking about, Wayne.

52:02.661 --> 52:05.371
Yeah, right! Come on, now!

52:05.456 --> 52:07.081
What about these?

52:13.380 --> 52:16.633
-Where did these come from?
-l did a little detective work.

52:16.842 --> 52:18.593
You did spy on me.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.053
Yes, l did.

52:23.891 --> 52:24.974
Easy.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.229
l think she took that well.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.357
Let's go.

52:36.111 --> 52:38.071
Ladies and gentlemen !

52:40.741 --> 52:43.576
Your roadie training begins today.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.412
lt will not be easy.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.248
You will get tired.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.583
You will get blisters.

52:51.085 --> 52:53.711
You will get aches and pains.

52:54.421 --> 52:56.881
But you will also get good.

52:59.844 --> 53:00.844
Are you ready?

53:00.928 --> 53:02.178
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

53:02.263 --> 53:05.098
Roadies present and accounted for, sir!

53:06.851 --> 53:08.268
Well, let's begin.

53:11.230 --> 53:12.230
Go!

53:12.439 --> 53:14.315
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

53:14.400 --> 53:16.442
On the stand, not on the ground !

53:16.777 --> 53:18.611
Come on, let's go!

53:19.613 --> 53:21.781
Go! Not on the ground !

53:22.283 --> 53:23.324
Not on the ground.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.118
Jesus! lt's crazy!

53:26.954 --> 53:28.997
They're getting better, Del. Look.

53:29.081 --> 53:31.541
-Not on the ground.
-Ow! Ow!

53:32.960 --> 53:33.960
Go!

53:38.132 --> 53:40.967
Get that microphone!
Get that microphone!

53:46.974 --> 53:50.518
You're worthless!
You're less than nothing !

53:50.811 --> 53:52.520
What's keeping you here?

53:52.605 --> 53:56.107
You don't belong here!
Why don't you just quit?

53:56.775 --> 54:00.445
'Cause l got no place else to go!

54:06.118 --> 54:07.201
Whoa.

54:19.423 --> 54:20.715
Thanks for coming in with me.

54:20.799 --> 54:23.927
l'm always a little afraid
to come in by myself.

54:31.143 --> 54:32.226
Come.

54:33.646 --> 54:34.979
Come on.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.446
Come on. Sit down.

54:46.450 --> 54:49.077
And l'll fix us a little drink, okay?

55:17.439 --> 55:18.731
There you are.

55:19.650 --> 55:21.401
An Old Fashioned.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.614
This Coke's gone bad.

55:29.535 --> 55:32.328
l just love a man with a sense of humor.

55:33.247 --> 55:35.081
-You know what l wish?
-What?

55:35.165 --> 55:38.501
l wish l could climb up
inside of that big old brain of yours

55:38.585 --> 55:40.044
and just walk around.

55:40.129 --> 55:41.337
Really?

55:42.131 --> 55:44.340
-You know what l love?
-What?

55:44.508 --> 55:48.386
l love the way those big, thick glasses
magnify your pupils.

55:48.470 --> 55:50.179
-Oh.
-Look at me.

55:52.933 --> 55:56.019
l'll bet you like to be in control. Tell me.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.438
Well, when l was 1 7,

55:58.605 --> 56:01.691
my little sister tried to borrow
my Def Leppard record.

56:01.775 --> 56:03.693
l said, "No way."

56:04.069 --> 56:06.529
Now, that's exactly
what l'm talking about.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.367
Oh, my God. You're so limber.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.828
Don't you just love music?

56:20.794 --> 56:22.587
Do you have any Megadeth?

56:35.267 --> 56:36.642
Come with me.

56:37.144 --> 56:38.728
l'm blind.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.313
Whoa.

56:44.610 --> 56:45.818
Okay.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.494
l'm dancing.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.624
You're real squiggly.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Whoa.

57:05.339 --> 57:07.381
-Did you hurt yourself?
-Yeah.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.967
-Let me see. Oh. There.
-That's it.

57:10.052 --> 57:11.177
Yeah.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.889
Feel naughty. Feel naughty.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.892
l thought l saw a puddy cat. Whoa!

57:17.976 --> 57:19.852
Boldly go
where no man has ever gone before.

57:19.937 --> 57:22.355
There's got to be a way to find. . .

57:23.690 --> 57:25.608
-Take me, Garth.
-Where?

57:25.692 --> 57:27.777
l'm low on gas and you need a jacket.

57:27.861 --> 57:29.487
l'm gonna be frank.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.781
Okay. Can l still be Garth?

57:32.032 --> 57:33.783
Shut up and kiss me.

58:05.190 --> 58:08.192
Can l have some cocoa later?

58:17.452 --> 58:19.328
Good morning, darling.

58:19.663 --> 58:21.330
l trust you slept well.

58:21.415 --> 58:24.041
l hope l wasn't too much of an animal.

58:25.878 --> 58:27.962
Come, hold me.

58:28.338 --> 58:30.214
You know l will.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.262
Party on.

58:37.222 --> 58:40.474
Oh, he's bobbing. He's weaving.
He winds up!

58:40.934 --> 58:42.727
Oh, denied !

58:44.104 --> 58:45.271
Yeah !

58:48.817 --> 58:50.026
Are you all right?

58:50.110 --> 58:51.235
Women.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.613
l feel like l've been placed
in the delete bin of life

58:53.697 --> 58:55.573
next to Mahogany Rush.

58:55.908 --> 58:57.825
Oh. l'm sorry.

58:58.785 --> 59:02.205
Well, relationships aren't for the timid.

59:02.998 --> 59:05.291
-Yeah.
-And l should know.

59:07.461 --> 59:11.255
For l am no longer a stranger
in the ways of the woman.

59:11.757 --> 59:14.217
All right, man, all right.

59:14.301 --> 59:15.843
Good work, my friend.

59:15.928 --> 59:18.054
On that note, game on.

59:18.305 --> 59:19.555
Game on !

59:21.808 --> 59:23.017
All right!

59:23.143 --> 59:24.977
He's wheeling, he's dealing.

59:25.145 --> 59:28.481
He shoots, he scores!

59:28.941 --> 59:30.858
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

59:30.943 --> 59:34.320
it takes two people to run a concert,

59:34.780 --> 59:39.242
one backstage and one out front.

59:40.327 --> 59:41.410
Two.

59:41.912 --> 59:44.747
One man alone cannot do this.

59:46.124 --> 59:49.252
Wayne, you will run
the backstage team.

59:49.836 --> 59:52.004
Milton, you are the liaison

59:52.089 --> 59:57.510
between Wayne's backstage team
and Garth's front stage team,

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.471
which includes myself in the booth.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:05.351
To the left and the right of the stage
are the machine gun nests,

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.186
belt-fed M60 Brownings.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:11.565
Now, these babies tend to heat up,
so shoot in three-second bursts.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.609
ln the event of capture,

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:17.405
l will personally
distribute cyanide capsules

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.116
to be placed under the tongue like so.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.994
Any questions?

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:24.996
Yeah. l have a question.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.415
When did you turn into a nut bar?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.463
Thank you, Mr. Scream.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.966
Hey, in a minute I'm gonna
bejoined by Wayne and Garth.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.509
They're gonna give us the lowdown

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:41.220
about the upcoming
Waynestock concert.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:44.056
Hi. We're here to see Handsome Dan.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.391
My name is Wayne Campbell.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.726
Ja, l know.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.811
We've been expecting you,
Wayne Campbell.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.563
l am Bjergen Kjergen.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.107
Wow, l love your accent.
Where are you from?

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.484
-l am from Sweden.
-Oh, really?

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:56.610
Whereabouts in Sweden?

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.988
Knuergen, near the Bjorgen Fjords.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.365
Well, nice to meet you, Bjergen Kjergen

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.784
from Knuergen near the Bjorgen Fjords.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.453
Knuergen.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:08.331
That's in the Klargen province,
near the Biburgen river.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:09.498
Ja.

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.125
Now correct me if l'm wrong.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.837
Your annual rainfall varies
from about 40 inches in the winter,

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.881
to about 200 inches in the summer,

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.884
and your chief export
is modular furniture.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:22.470
l did a project on Sweden
in the eighth grade.

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.806
Well, l am impressed
with your quest for knowledge.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.767
Educated men are rare.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.770
lt was really hard.
l stayed up all night working on it.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.229
Then the next day, in gym class,

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:35.274
l was on the mini tramp,
and l got diarrhea.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:40.446
l really wish l hadn't told you that.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.782
Well, l am sorry to hear of your illness,

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.868
but since you have
sacrificed your health

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.370
for knowledge of my home country,

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:52.625
l find you very attractive, and l hope
to make love to you in the near future.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.252
Well, shnuergen.

01:01:56.171 --> 01:02:00.466
Okay. All right.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.385
Dick Van Dyke Show.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.178
Hi.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.808
-Good work, my friend.
-Yeah.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.230
Are you wearing Brut?

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:16.524
Yes.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.902
My woman likes me in cologne.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.570
Hey, Wayne, Garth,

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:24.198
let me get my headset off,
l'll be right out.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.491
Oh, wow!

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.958
Hi, Handsome Dan.
lt's great to meet you.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.168
l'm not Handsome Dan.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.005
Hi.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:41.507
Hey.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:42.925
Hi.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:44.885
Dansome

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.095
-Dan.
-Dan.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:54.687
Back with you on WPlG,
maximum grunt.

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:57.773
All right. Our special guests right now,

01:02:57.858 --> 01:02:59.191
Wayne Campbell, Garth Algar.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.110
Wayne's World, Wayne's World.
All right.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.529
Talking about Waynestock.
Very exciting. Big event.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:04.780
Everybody's excited, huh?

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:08.534
Yeah. lt's gonna be a big concert
at Adlai Stevenson Park.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.411
lt's just gonna be a big party, you know.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.496
We got some great bands coming.

01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:14.331
Like Aerosmith.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:18.127
l just wanna remind everybody
that there's still plenty of tickets left.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:21.046
But that's no reason
to wait till the last minute.

01:03:21.173 --> 01:03:24.967
Because it's just a chance
for the city of Aurora. . .

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.261
To do something. . .

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.473
Fun.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.600
And to put the city on the map.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.436
lt's a lot of work.

01:03:35.604 --> 01:03:37.897
Oh, well, work is hard.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.649
You're not really listening to me,
are you?

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:44.737
l mean, l could say anything right now,
like, "You're a complete tool."

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.322
But you wouldn't hear it,

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.909
'cause you're a freak with a microphone.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.663
lt's not even challenging anymore.
lt's like shooting fish in a barrel.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.248
lsn't that true, sphincter boy?

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.958
What? Oh !

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.835
They're getting closer all the time.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.171
All right. Good information
about Waynestock. Very exciting.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.423
We'll be back with more,
right after Pig sports.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.217
Right now,
it's 1 6 minutes past the big hour.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.677
ls that not right, Mr. Scream?

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:14.517
Great. Good stuff.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.519
l think people are getting really cranked.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:28.280
-Hi. Bobby? lt's Wayne Campbell.
-Wayne.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.824
How'd you get this number?

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.702
lt was written on the back
of a business card.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.955
Hey, l'm looking for Cassandra.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.749
Do you know where she is?
l have to talk to her. lt's really important.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.668
Cassandra? No, l haven't seen her.

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:44.004
She said she might come to LA.
She wasn't definite.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:48.133
lf l hear anything, l'll let you know.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.677
l have to go.

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:52.346
l'm with someone.
l'm sorry l couldn't help.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:55.140
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.687
lmportant call?

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.022
Some small-time promoter.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.283
Let's get some lunch.

01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:48.569
What you're saying
is that Peter Lawford warned Kennedy

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:51.614
not to mess with
the military-industrial complex.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.532
Yeah. Dig this, man.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.910
J. Edgar Hoover was one bad cat.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.497
l mean, he had
a completely different bag from Jack.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:02.499
l mean, he just couldn't groove.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:05.294
And when two cats
can't groove to the same tune,

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.047
one of them
has to visit the man upstairs.

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.507
That's amazing, man.

01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:12.718
Excuse me. Hey, Wayne,

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:15.763
l want you to meet a friend of mine,
Sammy Davis Jr.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.307
Wow! Nice to meet you, Mr. Jr.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:19.975
Nice to meet you, too, man.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:23.145
l gotta split, man.
l got some cats l gotta hang with.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:24.605
Bye, Sammy.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.024
He's a good man.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.902
And now, Wayne, what can l do you for?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.946
Listen, Jim, l'm really confused, okay?

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:35.491
We haven't sold any tickets yet,
none of the bands have signed,

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.826
Garth is distracted by chicks,

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.662
l broke up with my girlfriend,

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.998
and on top of all that,
Del's gone completely mental.

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:44.375
To complete your journey,

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:47.336
you're gonna have to help
some people along the way.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.506
This next little bit,
you're gonna have to go it alone.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.508
Keep the faith, my friend.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:54.927
lf you book them, they will come.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.013
Hey, Sammy, wait up.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.518
Hey, Jim, what if nobody shows up?

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.144
Jim !

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.155
Oh, wow.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:17.991
Sand.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.786
Cool. Yeah.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:24.790
Right.

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:26.542
Right, Moe.

01:07:27.127 --> 01:07:28.335
l understand.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.503
Nervous?

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:31.964
A little.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.966
l've never been
on The Tonight Show before.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.385
Nothing to worry about.
After the show, l thought we. . .

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:38.262
After the show,
l have to fly back to Aurora.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:40.931
-l'm doing Waynestock, remember?
-Waynestock?

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.683
What's this Waynestock thing?

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.601
lt's nothing.
Just something she has to do.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.311
Hold on a second, Moe.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:50.899
Listen, Bobby's put together
some great musicians.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.110
You're making a great album.

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:55.571
Together, it can't miss.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.157
You're in good hands. He's the best.

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:01.577
You listen to Bobby,
and you're gonna be a big star.

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:03.203
A big star.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.080
Moe? Yeah.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:10.586
Well, we're almost out of time,
but l'd just like to point out

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:15.716
that there are still plenty of excellent
Waynestock tickets still available.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:19.011
Actually, there are about 1 0,000

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.014
excellent Waynestock tickets
still available.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.349
And l'd also like to address a rumor.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.934
There's this rumor

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:28.228
that none of the bands have signed,

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:30.731
and that probably
no one's gonna show up.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:34.067
While it's true
that none of the bands have signed,

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.944
Jim Morrison and his
weird naked lndian friend

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:40.532
visited me in the night and assured me
that all the bands are gonna come.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:41.825
-All right.
-Yeah.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.786
All right. Well, that's all the time
we have for this week.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.453
So, until then, good night.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:47.456
-Party on, Garth.
-Party on, Wayne.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.957
It's Wayne's World, Wayne's World

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.085
Party time, excellent

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.634
-And we're clear.
-All right!

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.011
Wayne, you know,

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:06.725
l don't know if you should mention
that Jim Morrison thing anymore.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.813
Yeah, yeah.
lt's just that people have started to talk.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:12.439
You know, they're saying things like,

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:17.694
"Hey, there goes Garth
and his friend Wayne, the psychopath."

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:21.240
lt's embarrassing.
No offense or nothing.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.242
Oh, no. No, none taken.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:28.287
l believe this knife is yours.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.082
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:34.586
lt's just that things
have started to look a little bleak.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.839
Bleak? What?

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:38.674
Hey, no guff, Chet.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:41.260
Until you pointed that out,
it hadn't occurred to me.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.469
Hey, where are you going?

01:09:42.554 --> 01:09:43.845
-Mikita's.
-Mikita's. Yeah.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:46.180
You know. The usual.
Are you gonna come?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.183
No, no, no. You guys go and have fun.

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:51.103
l'd probably just end up
embarrassing you anyways.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:55.315
No, no. l'm just gonna stay here
and lick the cat's butt.

01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:57.609
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:01.238
Just 15 to 20 minutes,

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:02.781
three times a week,

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.616
can really make a difference in...

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.618
How about all the otherproducts here?
How much for those?

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.329
Joe, you know the price, $29. 95.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.210
And that song is from your album
that's coming out, right?

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:16.879
-Oh, man.
-Right.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.171
She looks great.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.090
It should be out next month,

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:22.217
or we hope it will be.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.136
Now, who's... Now, who's "we"?

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.847
Now, who are you looking at?
Let's see. Let's see the guy

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.932
That's Bobby Cahn, my producer.

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:31.268
Oh, that fine-looking man
is your producer, huh?

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.729
Oh, man, I'm in the wrong business.
See, I should be a record producer,

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:37.065
then I'd have attractive-looking women
waving and smiling at me all the time.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.483
Hi, Bobby.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.321
She will be mine again. Oh, yes.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:45.282
She will be mine again.

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:48.952
You were terrific. They loved you.

01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:50.287
-You think so?
-Are you kidding?

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:53.040
Listen to them. They loved you. Me, too.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:55.042
You know, l didn't think l could
do it without my band.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.336
But the guys you put together
were so hot.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.172
-Damn, l had fun.
-Good. Let's celebrate.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.465
Okay.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:04.343
Did you give any thought to what l said?

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.638
Yeah. l'm still thinking about it.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.556
Give me a week?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.350
Okay.

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:16.563
What's the matter? ls anything wrong?

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.315
Oh, Garth.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.444
Oh, Garth, l'm so scared.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.988
What, has someone hurt you?
l mean, l'll take care of it.

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:26.907
l'm a grownup now, you know.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.201
lt's. . .

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.536
lt's my husband.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.705
Your what?

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:36.416
Oh, darling. l meant to tell you,

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.126
but my divorce isn't final.

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:41.880
And he came over here yesterday,
and he was crazy, like an animal.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.967
Oh, l wish someone would kill him.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.761
You mean, kill your husband?

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.180
No! No! Don't say it.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.974
You mustn't even think it.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:55.477
l mean, l know you love me,
but l won't let you kill my husband.

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:59.856
Although, l know you want to.
We both know you want to.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:02.192
And then you could have me
anytime you want.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:04.152
And l do mean anytime.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.656
Get me my cigarettes, would you, lover?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.658
They're in my purse.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:15.288
l'm just so. . .

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.457
Whoa.

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.087
That's a pretty big gun.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:24.923
Oh, darling. . .

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.343
All this talk about killing,

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:30.512
and .45 Magnums
with the clip filed down

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.055
and the safety off. . .

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.641
Oh, it's just all so confusing.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.768
l won't. l won't.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:40.105
l won't. l won't.
l won't. l won't. l won't. l won't.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.191
-l won't let you.
-He is a dead man.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.119
No way.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.623
You know what?

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.585
l got myself into this.
l'm gonna get myself out of it.

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.379
l'm gonna take it on the chin,
and l'm gonna be a man.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.214
Keep the faith, my friend.

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:09.092
If you book them, they will come.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:13.638
Okay. All right, man.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.016
You gotta stop doing that, all right?

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.309
Oh, man.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.102
Hello, is anybody here?

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:20.729
Hello.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.690
Oh, my God ! Rip Taylor! Oh, my God !

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.400
How are you?
You must be Wayne Campbell.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.319
-Yes, l am.
-How are you, Wayne?

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.445
Very good.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:29.946
This must be Waynestock.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.156
Yes, it is.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.409
lt's a little rustic, a little bucolic,
but, oh, well, l like it. lt's cute.

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:35.660
Thanks.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.746
Oh, how are you, pal?
You better get ready for the show.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.039
Get dressed.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.500
You can see him?

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:42.667
Well, of course l can see him.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:46.088
l mean, how are you gonna miss
a half-naked lndian, for God's sake?

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:48.924
Rip Taylor, Garth Algar.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:51.009
Rip, you showed up. Cool.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:54.096
Yeah. And my people got a call
from you, you know. Thank you.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.766
And before l could say, "No,"
this guy came to me in a dream.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.644
l said, "Who are you?"
He said, "Jim Morrison.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:02.354
"l'm a dead rock star."

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.439
l said, "l'm not familiar with your work."

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.316
So, he played me
a record from The Doors.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.777
And l said, "Well, you appear to be
more like a crooner

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.862
"working in the rock milieu, which l like."

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.572
Why is our order taking so long?

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:16.118
So, well, you know, he said,
"You gotta do Waynestock."

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.203
So, l figured, what the hey?

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:20.997
Hey, what's going on?

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:22.833
-Don't you know?
-No.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.293
-We're here for Waynestock.
-Same here, dude.

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:28.004
-Really looking forward to it, too.
-Later.

01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:30.215
Wayne, where did all these people
come from?

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.051
Garth, this is big.
We gotta get back to the playing fields.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.148
So, have you seen Cassandra?

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.441
l know. lt's weird.

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:50.735
l don't know where she is either.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.990
l know. l mean, she said she'd play,
and she never misses a gig.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:58.076
All right. Well, if you see her,
can you send her over to Waynestock?

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:01.037
All right. Thanks a lot, chief.
All right, bye-bye.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:03.665
Wayne! Wayne!

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.334
Okay, here's what's happening so far.

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.211
A lot of people have started to show up,

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:10.255
but none of the bands are here.

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.883
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:14.843
l'm going to hurl.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.179
Okay, Garth, ixnay on the url-hay.

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:20.265
l need your help. Think!
Where could Cassandra be?

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.646
l think l had too much Jolt cola.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:31.610
Hello?

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.486
Jeff, Wayne.

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.488
l cannot find your daughter,
and l'm greatly troubled.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:37.365
Alas, my young friend.

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:39.743
l have chosen another for my daughter.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:41.203
You are an excellent warrior,

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.455
but l require more in a son-in-law.

01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.165
He has money.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.376
Name the one you have chosen,
and surely he will die by my hand.

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.337
He goes by the name of Bobby.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:53.798
He has offered security,
a career and a green card.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:55.717
l arranged the match myself.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.011
And though l am sure
this information will be useless to you

01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:00.055
so late in the film,
they are to be married

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:03.058
at the First Presbyterian Church
on Gordon Street.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.686
Sorry l could not invite you
to the wedding, my young friend.

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:10.315
lt's okay. She's marrying Bobby.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.113
-What are you doing?
-l'm out!

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:20.408
l have to go find Cassandra
and tell her how l feel.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:23.745
But l can't do the concert by myself.
lt takes two men to run the concert!

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.622
You're right. l'm in.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.250
But l love her! l'm freaking out!

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.043
What am l gonna do?

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:33.004
Go get Cassandra.
Del and l will run the concert.

01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:38.885
Just go get Cassandra
and be back before we start!

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.387
Go, now!

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:44.182
Yay!

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.439
Now, move it, people!

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:53.525
Go! Go! Go!

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:55.735
Hi !

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.862
l'm kind of busy now.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:00.824
l just wanted to know

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.994
if you needed anything
from the Permit Office.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.542
That's the UNIX book.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.420
Yeah.

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:14.587
Cool.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:25.140
Whoa!

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:37.193
All right, men. Our work here is done.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.073
Excellent.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.410
Whoa!

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.580
Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:32.791
Where's the First Presbyterian Church
on Gordon Street?

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:37.337
-Gordon Street! Gordon Street!
-Oh, yeah, Gordon Street.

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:41.633
l once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street,

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:43.968
but that was a long time ago,

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.054
when l was young.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.972
Do we have to put up with this?

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.350
l mean, can't we get a better actor?

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:54.479
l know it's a small part,
but l think we can do better than this.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.361
Gordon Street?

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.447
Oh, yes, Gordon Street.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.992
l once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street,

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.661
a long time ago,

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.371
when l was a young man.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:15.041
Not a day passes
that l don't think of her,

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.253
and the promise l made which

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.672
l will always keep,

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:23.883
that one perfect day on Gordon Street.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:27.887
That's five blocks up, two over.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:31.975
Thank you.

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.505
Welcome to Aurora!

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.632
Eat me!

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:10.221
Notjust a place, but a state ofmind.

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:01.189
Jesus! God, no.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:08.530
Cassandra!

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:12.659
Oh. Hi. Sorry!

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:14.244
Sorry, everybody!

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:15.828
Wrong wedding !

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.122
Who's he?

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.649
Oh, Jesus. God, no.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.324
-Cassandra!
-What an asshole!

01:21:53.867 --> 01:22:18.933
Cassandra!

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.728
Wayne!

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.073
You punk.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.992
You crazy punk.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.047
Come on. Come on, Cassandra.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.591
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:15.823
Stevenson Park! Step on it!

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:19.577
One. Two.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:24.082
Check two!

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.460
Okay. We have some word

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:30.296
that there is some bad
red rope licorice

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.757
circulating in the crowd.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:37.303
Repeat, stay away
from the red rope licorice.

01:23:37.388 --> 01:23:40.848
Do not bite any off and chew it.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:44.435
-It could cause a dental emergency.
-Go! Get off the stage!

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.569
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.287
Hey, huh?

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.706
Huh? Guys, huh?

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.999
Wayne, Cassandra, you made it!

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:08.584
-Yeah !
-Yeah !

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.128
This is great!

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:16.342
What are we gonna do?
None of the bands have showed up.

01:24:16.427 --> 01:24:20.388
l don't know, man. Jim Morrison said,
"lf you book them, they will come."

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:23.599
l don't know, Wayne.
lt doesn't look too good.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:26.269
Jim?

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:32.191
Jim !

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:37.822
Wow, we really are in the desert.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:39.824
Yeah, no guff.

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:45.580
Wow, Jim Morrison.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:47.206
Told you so, man.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.750
How can l help you?

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:51.461
Jim, none of the bands have showed up.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:54.005
l know, and they're not gonna show up.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:57.216
Then why were we
supposed to put on the concert?

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:00.428
Because you had to try
and do something with your life.

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.513
But it was a failure.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.223
Whether you won or lost,

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:07.351
what's important is
that you gave it your best shot.

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:09.437
l'm sorry, man.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.563
Okay.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:11.773
All right.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:15.026
You'll think of something.
lt's your movie.

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:17.945
Well, thanks a pantload, Chet.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:19.363
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:21.866
Wayne, where are we?

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.203
Whoa. How do we get back?

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:45.723
Wayne, Wayne. . .

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:49.227
We don't wanna end
the movie this way, do we?

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.895
Good call, Garth.

01:25:51.021 --> 01:25:54.232
lf we're gonna go down,
let's at least go down in glory.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.735
Let's do the Thelma & Louise ending.
Yeah !

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.793
Let's just keep going, Wayne.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:16.212
Okay, Garth.

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.107
Hey, we don't wanna
end the movie like this.

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:38.901
Yeah. Let's do the happy ending.

01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:40.111
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:47.368
None of the bands
have showed up, Wayne.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:50.663
-What are we gonna do?
-What are we gonna do, you guys?

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:51.789
We could do it on the stage.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:11.142
You made it! Excellent!

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.894
Welcome to Waynestock.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.061
Yeah !

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:17.732
-All right.
-Thanks for coming.

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:23.404
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:28:01.192
Jim, why was l supposed to
put on this concert?

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:05.613
Because you had to learn
that it doesn't matter what you do,

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:08.199
Cassandra loves you for who you are,

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:11.327
and that being an adult means

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:16.415
facing responsibility,
yet still taking the time to have fun.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:20.461
Right. lt's sort of like
coming home on Friday night

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:22.463
and doing your homework right away,

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.716
so that your Saturday night
is free to just party.

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.636
No, l like the way l said it better.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.515
Okay.

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:42.650
Excuse me.

01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:43.734
Yo!

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:46.278
Over here.
Would you open the gate, please?

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:47.488
l have to get in there.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:48.823
Sorry, you can't come in.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:50.074
My girlfriend is in there.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.910
Hey, a lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:46.208
Hey, don't cry.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.211
Yeah, we're gonna clean it up. Okay?

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:07.062
See?
