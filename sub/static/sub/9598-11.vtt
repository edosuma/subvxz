01:04.373 --> 01:08.242
<i>[groans] Okay.</i>

01:08.277 --> 01:10.678
Whoever said that you
feel great after a workout

01:10.746 --> 01:13.381
never went for a run in
the middle of a heat wave.

01:13.415 --> 01:15.816
Well, when perspiration
evaporates from the skin,

01:15.884 --> 01:18.853
it extracts the heat by
vaporization in order to change

01:18.854 --> 01:21.556
into a gaseous state,
resulting in a cooling effect.

01:21.590 --> 01:27.128
So I need to run faster
and sweat more to cool off?

01:27.195 --> 01:28.729
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:28.764 --> 01:30.264
Hey, hey, hey. 
Guys, that's dangerous.

01:30.332 --> 01:32.767
- Here, here, here. Give me that.
- We were just trying to cool off.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.535
All right, well, you come over here

01:34.570 --> 01:36.604
or that water's gonna
knock you on your swimsuit.

01:41.209 --> 01:43.744
[grunts] There you go.

01:43.779 --> 01:47.233
- Thanks, ma'am.
- What? "Ma'am"? Really?

01:50.352 --> 01:52.653
<i>They're so cute.</i>

01:55.774 --> 01:58.042
You're still going to
be a mother someday,

01:58.076 --> 02:00.044
and you're going to be a great one.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.947
Thanks.

02:02.981 --> 02:04.715
- Hi, Angela.
- Hi.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.350
Hey, Ma. 
What are you doing here?

02:06.385 --> 02:08.252
Well, Maura told me you guys
were going out for a run,

02:08.287 --> 02:09.687
so I went and I got some sweat tea.

02:09.721 --> 02:12.423
Those guys over at
herbland recommended it.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.325
It helps keep you cool.

02:14.393 --> 02:19.964
Ma, this tea is steaming hot.
And it smells disgusting.

02:19.998 --> 02:21.632
It's the peppers.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.668
Uh, well, the cultures of some
of the hottest places on Earth

02:23.735 --> 02:26.704
consume hot and spicy food
because it makes you sweat.

02:26.738 --> 02:30.174
[cellphones vibrate]

02:30.209 --> 02:31.642
Rizzoli.

02:31.677 --> 02:33.578
- Isles.
- Okay, yeah, we'll be right there.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.647
[inhales deeply] Got to go.

02:36.715 --> 02:39.283
But try it. It'll keep you cool.

02:39.318 --> 02:41.152
Yeah, so will sitting in
front of an open beer fridge,

02:41.186 --> 02:44.422
- and you don't have to vomit first.
- Maybe next time.

<i>I was so hot last night,
I didn't get any sleep.</i>

03:14.219 --> 03:16.220
You have central
air-conditioning, right?

03:16.255 --> 03:17.588
Uh, yes, but I don't use it.

03:17.656 --> 03:22.093
- Why, you trying to make me feel bad?
- Because I sleep in the nude.

03:22.127 --> 03:25.196
Note to self ... 
no follow-up questions.

03:25.230 --> 03:26.697
Well, it helps to
lower body temperature,

03:26.732 --> 03:28.699
which stimulates your cortisol.

03:28.734 --> 03:32.703
I can regulate my own
cortisol, thank you.

03:32.738 --> 03:34.338
What do we got?

03:34.373 --> 03:37.108
Male, no apparent
lacerations, signs of neglect.

03:37.142 --> 03:40.244
- I'm guessing shih tzu.
- Maybe a hint of poodle.

03:40.312 --> 03:42.413
I found this little guy wandering
around with signs of heat stroke.

03:42.447 --> 03:43.681
Couldn't just leave him.

03:43.715 --> 03:46.350
He's very cute. 
What about the victim?

03:46.385 --> 03:48.052
Our victim's Richard Nelson.

03:48.086 --> 03:51.489
Male, 28 years old,
up on the third floor.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.625
- What's wrong with you?
- Third floor, Jane.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.794
- So?
- The power's out.

03:56.828 --> 03:59.764
Uh, too many people running
their A.C.s overnight.

03:59.798 --> 04:02.733
No elevator. I've been running
up and down for an hour.

04:02.801 --> 04:05.452
Well, why don't you wait out here.
Take a little break.

04:05.509 --> 04:07.438
Maybe the dog's owners will show up.

04:07.472 --> 04:09.240
You see how that dog
is panting to cool down?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.776
Works for humans, too.

[groans]

04:24.222 --> 04:26.190
[pants]

04:27.224 --> 04:31.429
Since when did South Boston
get a hipster arts district?

04:31.496 --> 04:34.599
Its realtors rebranded
this neighborhood "Sobo."

04:34.633 --> 04:38.169
- Don't say that. That is not a thing.
- Oh, it is a thing, Jane.

04:38.203 --> 04:40.338
I get invited to Sobo art
galleries all the time.

04:40.372 --> 04:43.441
- There's the landlord.
- I'll meet you guys inside.

04:43.475 --> 04:45.209
<i>I'm telling you I can't do anything
till the police take a look.</i>

04:45.244 --> 04:47.812
They're here now. 
I'll call you back later.

04:47.846 --> 04:51.282
- [exhales sharply] Sorry.
- What can you tell us about the victim?

04:51.316 --> 04:52.783
He was, um, a good tenant.

04:52.818 --> 04:55.453
Quiet, and always paid
his rent a week early.

04:55.487 --> 04:58.556
- What did he do for a living?
- He was a bartender.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.824
A bartender can afford a
place in this neighborhood?

04:59.858 --> 05:01.525
Oh, his apartment was rent controlled.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.563
But he's been here a long
time, about 8 years B.S.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.532
- "B.S."?
- Before Sobo.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.769
All right, uh, how did you find him?

05:11.803 --> 05:16.340
I came up about 10:30 this morning
when a neighbor from downstairs ...

05:16.375 --> 05:17.274
she complained about water
leaking from the ceiling.

05:17.309 --> 05:20.578
- Okay, thanks.
- You bet.

05:22.247 --> 05:26.384
- [sighs] What caused the leak?
- Follow me.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.820
Ugh.

05:29.855 --> 05:33.691
That's a lot for one guy.
Did the neighbors hear anything?

05:33.725 --> 05:35.159
Nothing.

05:35.193 --> 05:40.898
Okay, it is ridiculously hot.
I'm opening a window.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.301
- Shit.
- Painted shut?

05:44.336 --> 05:46.270
No, there are water spots in the dust.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.372
It looks like something was
dragged over the windowsill.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.740
[sighs]

05:49.775 --> 05:52.376
If we open the window,
we might destroy evidence.

05:52.411 --> 05:54.345
Oh, the curse of competence. 
[sighs]

05:54.379 --> 05:57.214
Hey, um, can you guys
get a sample of this?

05:57.249 --> 05:58.382
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

05:58.417 --> 06:00.885
Thanks. 
There's a fiber right there.

06:00.919 --> 06:04.989
Body's in there.
[sighs]

06:08.760 --> 06:13.431
Ugh.
Heat waves and dead bodies do not mix.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.600
- Mm. Time of death?
- It's hard to tell.

06:16.635 --> 06:19.937
The upper body is badly decomposed
due to the extreme heat,

06:19.971 --> 06:22.540
and the lower extremities
are well-preserved.

06:22.574 --> 06:24.208
So he's half-baked.

06:24.276 --> 06:25.543
[scoffs]

06:28.280 --> 06:31.515
- Well, that's weird.
- What?

06:31.583 --> 06:34.218
Well, core body temperature
for the lower extremities

06:34.252 --> 06:37.421
- is 65 degrees.
- It was 90 degrees last night.

06:38.924 --> 06:41.892
Did the landlord say that he
turned the running water off?

06:41.927 --> 06:44.261
No, he told me he bolted
when he saw the body.

06:44.296 --> 06:47.898
Maybe he was in a big tub of ice.

06:47.933 --> 06:50.634
After a bottle of whisky, it
might have seemed like a good idea.

06:50.669 --> 06:54.605
Well, alcohol acts as a vasodilator.
It makes the person feel warm

06:54.639 --> 06:56.307
while their body temperature's
actually dropping.

06:56.341 --> 06:57.808
So if he was drunk, he
might not have realized

06:57.843 --> 07:00.678
- he was getting so cold.
- Hypothermia?

07:00.712 --> 07:02.413
It's possible.

07:02.481 --> 07:05.282
Freezing to death in the
middle of a heat wave.

07:05.317 --> 07:08.385
Just when I thought
we'd seen everything.

07:22.364 --> 07:24.965
[groans]

07:25.000 --> 07:29.737
This is the coolest ...
place in the building.

07:29.771 --> 07:32.706
Well, the autopsy room
is on a separate system.

07:32.774 --> 07:35.542
Can't let the bodies
deteriorate from the heat.

07:35.577 --> 07:38.278
[lowered voice] 
Why do you have an audience?

07:38.313 --> 07:41.281
Oh, well, they just wanted
to observe an autopsy.

07:46.588 --> 07:51.291
Orozco from media relations and
Anders from the carriage unit?

07:52.327 --> 07:53.427
[sighs]

07:53.461 --> 07:55.829
Oh, hi, Detective Rizzoli.

07:55.864 --> 07:57.998
Welcome. You're just in time
to hear the autopsy report.

07:58.033 --> 08:02.496
- They are using you for your cool air.
- I know, but I'll take

08:02.497 --> 08:07.041
any opportunity to get
people interested in science.

08:07.075 --> 08:11.045
Now, initially, I wasn't able
to see due to the bloating.

08:11.079 --> 08:14.391
But once I made the "y" incision,
I was able to determine that

08:14.392 --> 08:16.950
- the victim had a crushed larynx.
- Poor guy.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.552
Please hold your questions
and comments till the end.

08:18.586 --> 08:21.522
Thank you, Susie. 
So the cause of death was ...

08:21.589 --> 08:25.292
- Strangulation?
- That is right. It is strangulation.

08:25.326 --> 08:30.364
- Yay, science.
- Also, uh, the lab results came back

08:30.398 --> 08:32.366
on the fibers from the windowsill,

08:32.400 --> 08:35.335
and they were from a
heavy-duty composite rope.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.004
And what about the tox results?

08:37.038 --> 08:39.740
The blood-alcohol level was a 0.19.

08:39.774 --> 08:42.476
So he was drunk enough that
he'd be easy to strangle.

08:42.510 --> 08:44.878
And then once he was
dead, he was put on ice.

08:44.913 --> 08:46.013
That's what it looks like.

08:46.081 --> 08:50.517
By why would someone use ice?
To obscure time of death?

08:50.552 --> 08:53.487
Slow down decomposition? 
Hide the smell?

08:53.555 --> 08:58.828
- Maybe allow for more time to escape?
- You're being somewhat non-committal.

09:00.428 --> 09:04.765
It's hot. I wouldn't poke the bear.
[chuckles]

09:05.399 --> 09:11.872
- Metaphorically speaking.
- Thank you, Maura Jr.

09:15.710 --> 09:20.914
Well, now we're going to practice
weighing internal organs.

09:20.982 --> 09:23.784
And let's start with the liver.

09:23.818 --> 09:26.520
Yeah, I'm cool enough.

09:28.923 --> 09:34.928
- [sighs] I'm sorry, Dr. Isles.
- One step at a time, Susie.

09:34.963 --> 09:37.531
One step at a time.

09:39.834 --> 09:41.502
[sighs]

09:41.536 --> 09:44.605
It would have taken over 100 pounds
of ice for that tub to overflow.

09:44.639 --> 09:46.406
That's a hell of an ice delivery.

09:46.441 --> 09:49.660
Well, the dust on the windowsill
was recently disturbed, and we

09:49.661 --> 09:52.980
found rope fibers, so he must have
pulled it up through the window.

09:53.014 --> 09:54.848
Okay, you know what I've realized?

09:54.883 --> 10:01.588
That this is just hot air moving faster.

10:02.857 --> 10:04.391
What do we know about the victim?

10:04.425 --> 10:08.395
Oh, he was arrested once in college
for disorderly conduct.

10:08.429 --> 10:12.065
Other than that, pretty unremarkable.
Landlord said he had a girlfriend

10:12.100 --> 10:14.768
with bright red hair, freckles,
but she didn't come by much.

10:14.802 --> 10:18.205
Well, maybe this is just one of
those rare occasions, you know?

10:18.239 --> 10:19.907
They're having drinks, they
get in a lover's quarrel,

10:19.941 --> 10:22.809
- and she strangles him.
- She'd have to be a big girl

10:22.844 --> 10:24.845
to be strong enough to
haul him into the tub.

10:24.879 --> 10:26.547
<i>Well, we won't know until we find her.</i>

10:26.614 --> 10:29.716
Okay. I'm going to get an ice coffee.

10:29.751 --> 10:32.186
You said hell would freeze over
before you drank ice coffee.

10:32.220 --> 10:34.721
Too hot!

10:36.191 --> 10:37.758
I'm done dog-sitting.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.126
Hey, why did you lock
up little Sipowicz?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.861
I thought you weren't gonna name it.

10:40.895 --> 10:42.863
Well, I got to call it something
before I find his people.

10:42.897 --> 10:43.830
[dog whines]

10:43.865 --> 10:45.132

10:45.166 --> 10:47.501
Sipowicz, come.

10:47.535 --> 10:49.803
Call it whatever you want.
It's not gonna listen.

10:49.837 --> 10:52.439
He'll listen to me. 
Sipowicz, come.

10:52.473 --> 10:55.542
Sit.
[barking]

10:55.577 --> 11:00.847
- Heel. Sipowicz.
- Good luck, dog whisperer.

11:02.550 --> 11:05.052
Man, it's hot in here.

11:05.086 --> 11:08.155
You want to take our laptops
and go work in the autopsy room?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.923
Hanging out with dead bodies
is not really my thing,

11:09.958 --> 11:12.192
so I vote for solving
the crime and going home.

11:12.227 --> 11:15.662
- Whoa.
- What is it?

11:15.697 --> 11:17.631
This guy had a lot of
money squirreled away ...

11:17.665 --> 11:22.785
a dozen brokerage accounts,
ranging from $40,000 to $300,000.

11:22.820 --> 11:27.741
You sure? He only had like
$600 in his checking account.

11:27.775 --> 11:29.710
He's a millionaire.

11:29.744 --> 11:32.479
[sighs] I'm not sure I can add
properly with my brain on fire,

11:32.513 --> 11:33.914
but I think that's right.

11:33.948 --> 11:36.221
So we have a giant pile
of money for motive.

11:36.256 --> 11:37.050
Mm-hmm.

11:37.085 --> 11:39.286
Now we just got to figure
out who knew he had it.

11:41.623 --> 11:43.257
[panting]

11:43.291 --> 11:44.858
Sipowicz, come.

11:44.892 --> 11:46.893
Treat. Treat.

11:46.928 --> 11:50.130
[barking] 
Wait, wait!

11:50.164 --> 11:51.531

12:02.877 --> 12:05.879
<i>Muy bien.

12:05.913 --> 12:07.714
[laughs] Yeah.

12:09.217 --> 12:11.184
<i>Muy bien. 
Habló esten Español solo.</i>

12:11.219 --> 12:14.021
<i>Vámonos.

12:14.088 --> 12:15.956
[laughs] Yeah.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.090
[elevator bell dings]

12:17.125 --> 12:18.225
It turns out the broker's name

12:18.293 --> 12:20.127
was the same on all the accounts ...

12:20.161 --> 12:23.797
Alex Ruebens, Fisk Financials.
I-I called his office.

12:23.831 --> 12:25.098
His assistant said he
was in the neighborhood

12:25.133 --> 12:26.733
and would meet us here.

12:26.768 --> 12:28.735
Well, did she ask why
we wanted to see him?

12:28.770 --> 12:32.105
Yeah.
I-I told her Richard was dead,

12:32.173 --> 12:34.241
probably been killed
for his large fortune,

12:34.275 --> 12:37.944
and we had no leads and
could really use Alex's help.

12:37.979 --> 12:40.981
- Seriously?!
- No! I told her nothing.

12:41.015 --> 12:42.983
This heat is making you crazy.

12:44.352 --> 12:47.788
I bet a fancy investment
firm has air-conditioning.

12:47.822 --> 12:49.256
[sighs]

12:49.290 --> 12:51.792
Yeah.

12:51.826 --> 12:55.762
- Alex Ruebens?
- I'm Alex Ruebens.

12:56.931 --> 13:01.735
Oh, um, hi.
I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.

13:01.803 --> 13:03.203
I'm just gonna grab a
coffee. You want one?

13:03.271 --> 13:06.606
- No, thank you.
- Oh.

13:08.076 --> 13:12.045
Landlord said the
girlfriend had red hair.

13:12.080 --> 13:17.751
- Did he suffer?
- We don't know.

13:17.785 --> 13:20.654
When was the last time you saw him?

13:20.688 --> 13:23.190
Two days ago. We had lunch together.

13:23.224 --> 13:25.025
How long were you dating?

13:25.059 --> 13:28.895
Almost five years. We met at a funeral.

13:28.930 --> 13:33.100
No... that sounds horrible.
I was a funeral,

13:33.134 --> 13:35.736
and he was bringing flowers
to his grandmother's grave.

13:35.803 --> 13:39.106
Miss Ruebens, why don't you sit down?

13:46.947 --> 13:49.916
- Any idea who killed him?
- No.

13:49.951 --> 13:52.052
Rich was very private.

13:52.086 --> 13:55.055
But I assumed that
was the artist in him.

13:55.089 --> 13:58.158
- He was an artist?
- A novelist.

13:58.192 --> 14:00.894
He worked at the bar
to support his writing.

14:00.928 --> 14:03.830
Seems like the money you were
managing for him would support him.

14:05.400 --> 14:10.637
- Where did it come from?
- He found it.

14:10.705 --> 14:12.939
- He found it?
- Yes.

14:12.974 --> 14:15.075
Jogging ... he ... he
showed me an article about

14:15.109 --> 14:17.744
a drug-related shooting
in the same park.

14:17.779 --> 14:19.846
Why didn't he turn it in to the police?

14:19.881 --> 14:23.250
I-I checked with an attorney.
You don't have to turn in found money.

14:23.317 --> 14:27.387
Okay, so why work as a bartender
if he was a millionaire?

14:27.422 --> 14:29.256
He didn't want to spend the money

14:29.290 --> 14:32.726
until he had finished writing his book.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.996
I figured he was done
because he asked me to set up

14:36.030 --> 14:39.433
monthly transfers into
a new checking account.

14:39.467 --> 14:43.437
Okay, well, there was no will,
and there's no family to notify,

14:43.471 --> 14:46.940
- so where's the money go now?
- A trust.

14:46.974 --> 14:48.742
Who are the trustees?

14:50.278 --> 14:52.012
I am.

14:53.314 --> 14:56.817
- Where were you last night?
- At work.

14:56.851 --> 14:58.985
Look, he deposited the
money in installments,

14:59.020 --> 15:02.689
and I have the last one at my house.

15:02.723 --> 15:07.027
I will bring it in.
I don't want his money.

15:10.198 --> 15:11.832
[receiver clicks]

15:11.866 --> 15:13.266
There was a drug-related
shooting in Stony Brook Park

15:13.301 --> 15:15.101
around the time Rich
said he found the money.

15:15.136 --> 15:16.970
I just talked to my
guy in the drug unit.

15:17.004 --> 15:19.272
It was an undercover buy gone bad.

15:19.307 --> 15:21.274
There was cash involved,
but only 20 grand.

15:21.309 --> 15:22.976
So he saw the article in the newspaper,

15:23.010 --> 15:26.012
then used it as a cover
story for his girlfriend.

15:26.047 --> 15:27.881
That is a big lie.

15:27.915 --> 15:30.750
Probably means the money
is of a more dubious origin.

15:30.785 --> 15:32.118
You think the girlfriend's involved?

15:32.153 --> 15:34.120
[sighs]

15:34.155 --> 15:36.490
I don't think she's strong enough
to pull ice up through a window,

15:36.524 --> 15:40.160
- much less haul him into a bathtub.
- Sounds like a "maybe."

15:40.194 --> 15:44.397
It's a definite "maybe."
Hey, did you find anything?

15:44.465 --> 15:46.066
You know the great American
novel he was writing?

15:46.133 --> 15:47.467
Yeah.

15:47.502 --> 15:48.935
"I was facing a financial
crisis of my own.

15:48.970 --> 15:52.939
But for me, there would no bailout.
The game is rigged,

15:52.974 --> 15:57.277
and I was determined to
fix the odds in my favor."

15:58.546 --> 16:00.013
Continue.

16:00.047 --> 16:02.148
That's it. 
It's less great than short.

16:02.216 --> 16:04.284
If you ask me, it's the
perfect length for a novel.

16:04.318 --> 16:07.320
Wait a minute, okay, so
he's lying about the novel.

16:07.355 --> 16:11.391
He's lying about the money.
Where did this money come from?

16:11.425 --> 16:13.827
Well, the best lies
are usually half-truths.

16:13.895 --> 16:17.797
- So maybe he was a drug dealer.
- Hipster drug dealer laying low in Sobo.

16:17.832 --> 16:20.000
- Isn't that the bubble drink?
- No, that's soba.

16:20.034 --> 16:22.202
No, no, no, the noodles are
soba. Bubble drinks are boba.

16:22.236 --> 16:25.071
Sobo is what the hipsters
are calling South Boston.

16:25.106 --> 16:28.341
- It's not a thing.
- [barks] Never mind.

16:28.376 --> 16:31.077
If he wasn't bartending
to fund his creative dream,

16:31.112 --> 16:33.480
maybe that is how he
was making his money.

16:33.514 --> 16:36.482
Drugs ... it's the American way.

16:47.301 --> 16:50.336
- Good morning, Angela.
- Hi.

16:50.404 --> 16:51.704
Are you waiting for Jane?

16:51.738 --> 16:53.639
No, no, I'm waiting
for Korsak and Sipowicz.

16:53.707 --> 16:57.009
I'm on dog-sitting duty.

16:57.044 --> 16:59.979
Well, that sweat tea really
seems to be working for you.

17:00.013 --> 17:01.981
You just seem completely energized.

17:02.015 --> 17:04.416
I am. Two cups this morning.

17:04.483 --> 17:07.118
And I'm seeing colors
I-I've not seen before.

17:07.154 --> 17:09.290
- Really?
- You know, you didn't get

17:09.291 --> 17:11.424
to taste it the other day,
so I brought you another one.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.526
Oh, how thoughtful. Thank you.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.462
<i>Hey, Angela, thank you very
much for watching Sipowicz.</i>

17:16.496 --> 17:18.196
<i>- Angela: Oh!
- I just fed him, and he's already been walked.</i>

17:18.231 --> 17:20.333
Oh, great, no problem.
I'll take good care of him.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.701
[barking]

17:21.734 --> 17:24.804
<i>Sipowicz, ven aquí. Sientate.</i>

17:24.838 --> 17:28.273
I love that you speak Spanish, Vince.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.109
Say something else.

17:30.143 --> 17:31.410
<i>Muchas gracias, señorita.</i>

17:31.445 --> 17:33.112
[laughs]

17:33.180 --> 17:35.408
<i>Ven aquí. Ven aquí, perrito.</i>

17:37.150 --> 17:41.187
And that tie, uh, really, uh,
brings out the color in your eyes.

17:41.254 --> 17:42.588
[laughing] What are you talking about?

17:42.622 --> 17:44.423
This tie is brown. My eyes are green.

17:45.726 --> 17:49.829
Well, then you just look
good for no reason, Vince.

17:51.465 --> 17:54.700
<i>Come on, Sipowicz.
[dog barks]</i>

17:56.186 --> 17:59.288
- We're sorry about your friend.
- I can't believe he's gone.

17:59.356 --> 18:03.926
He would have sold five copies of his
novel to every customer at the bar.

18:03.961 --> 18:06.429
- So you were close?
- Rich changed my life.

18:06.496 --> 18:10.199
I used to tell stories all the time,
and Rich got me into writing.

18:10.234 --> 18:13.369
Man helped me finish my
first memoir, "Unbouncable."

18:13.437 --> 18:14.604
[chuckles]

18:14.638 --> 18:17.573
- Sounds like a great guy.
- He was.

18:17.641 --> 18:20.476
- Anybody feel differently?
- What do you mean?

18:20.510 --> 18:22.245
You know, someone who
would want to hurt him?

18:22.279 --> 18:24.113
I mean, if you asked me that
question about a week ago,

18:24.147 --> 18:26.649
I'd probably have said no.
But then the other night,

18:26.683 --> 18:30.353
this guy walks in and tried to cut
the line, and I tried to stop him.

18:30.420 --> 18:31.420
And he said Rich could vouch for him.

18:31.455 --> 18:33.826
But when Rich saw him,
he got real nervous and

18:33.827 --> 18:37.226
told me not to let him in.
The guy was pissed.

18:37.261 --> 18:39.462
- You get a good look at the guy?
- Sure.

18:39.496 --> 18:41.464
We'll need you to sit
with our sketch artist.

18:41.498 --> 18:43.299
Okay.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.268
Do you know anything about
Rich selling drugs at the bar?

18:45.302 --> 18:46.969
[scoffs] No way, man. Rich?

18:47.004 --> 18:51.140
Rich is one of the most
law-abiding people I ever met.

18:51.174 --> 18:54.510
Just the idea of double parking a car
made him break into a sweat.

18:54.578 --> 18:58.347
- He have a reason to be so nervous?
- That's just the way he was.

18:58.415 --> 19:01.217
Maybe his nervousness
was his artistic fuel.

19:01.251 --> 19:04.420
Or maybe your friend
was running on empty.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.192
[elevator bell dings]

19:21.238 --> 19:23.572
Hey, Todd. You change
from the vampire shift?

19:23.640 --> 19:27.710
No, Susie asked me to come help
with the overcrowding issues.

19:27.744 --> 19:32.615
- Love of science catching on?
- Yep. This is the hottest ticket in town.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.617
And the coolest place in the building.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.719
We're a sweaty bunch. Well, not you.

19:36.787 --> 19:39.055
You're not sweaty. You're clammy.

19:39.089 --> 19:42.458
Uh, moist.
Glistening?

19:42.492 --> 19:44.593
- Open the door, Todd.
- Okay. Sorry.

19:51.234 --> 19:54.770
- Do those come with a free daiquiri?
- You're so you sometimes.

19:54.805 --> 19:57.306
Do you have something?

19:57.341 --> 20:00.376
This is the cash
that the broker girlfriend gave us.

20:00.410 --> 20:02.478
Did you know that all
United States currency

20:02.512 --> 20:05.348
is printed on a cotton-linen
blend paper made by Crane & Co.,

20:05.382 --> 20:07.516
which they've been supplying since 1879?

20:07.551 --> 20:09.752
Yes. You know what else is a fun fact?

20:09.786 --> 20:13.222
Something that helps
me catch the killer.

20:13.256 --> 20:17.393
Okay. The entire stack had
consecutive serial numbers

20:17.427 --> 20:20.229
printed in Forth Worth, Texas, in 2008.

20:20.297 --> 20:23.833
Also, GC-MS scan showed
no signs of drug residue,

20:23.867 --> 20:26.268
Which is very strange,
given that 90% of U.S. bills

20:26.336 --> 20:28.204
have cocaine imbedded in their fibers.

20:28.238 --> 20:32.375
So no drug residue, and they
all were printed in 2008.

20:32.409 --> 20:35.711
It's like they came out of printing
and never went into circulation.

20:35.746 --> 20:38.147
Most likely.
I also found traces

20:38.215 --> 20:42.318
- of dried flowers, mold, and arsenic.
- The money was poisoned?

20:42.352 --> 20:46.489
Well, arsenic has many uses ...
a wood preservative, insecticide.

20:46.523 --> 20:48.624
Before 1910, it was used
as an embalming fluid.

20:48.658 --> 20:52.328
- And most recently ...
- Embalming fluid.

20:52.362 --> 20:54.530
Uh, the kind you find in old graves.

20:54.564 --> 20:57.433
[keyboard clacking]

20:57.467 --> 20:59.101
Not a grave...

21:00.604 --> 21:04.573
...but close.
Thanks, Maura.

21:07.144 --> 21:11.747
So, Rich's girlfriend
said they met here.

21:11.782 --> 21:14.617
He was bringing flowers
to his grandmother.

21:14.651 --> 21:18.454
- He lied about that, too?
- No, the ... the grandmother's here.

21:18.488 --> 21:19.822
And so is the great-grandmother.

21:19.890 --> 21:24.326
- And so is her sister, who died in 1906.
- You working on their family tree?

21:28.765 --> 21:31.925
I don't think the door's
supposed to be open, is it?

21:35.439 --> 21:38.274
The lock's busted. Someone broke in.

21:50.287 --> 21:51.754
Clear...

21:51.788 --> 21:56.559
Which seems odd to say in
the middle of a mausoleum.

21:56.626 --> 22:01.430
Maybe it wasn't a break in.
Maybe it was a break out.

22:01.465 --> 22:04.834
- What, our killer's a zombie?
- Could be fun.

22:04.868 --> 22:07.536
Probably we wouldn't have
to mirandize him or anything.

22:07.604 --> 22:11.173
There's something in there.

22:13.710 --> 22:18.214
Well... looks like Rich
was using granny for an ATM.

22:18.248 --> 22:22.184
Which, sadly, puts a stake
in your zombie theory.

22:30.271 --> 22:32.337
Yeah, that's him.

22:32.372 --> 22:34.673
Came around every
Friday, like clockwork.

22:34.708 --> 22:37.309
It's so nice when the youth
visit with such frequency.

22:37.343 --> 22:38.944
Such a shame.

22:38.978 --> 22:41.980
- Did he visit this past Friday?
- Yeah, he was here.

22:42.015 --> 22:43.816
Did Rich have any
reason to break the lock?

22:43.850 --> 22:45.918
No, he had my phone number.

22:45.952 --> 22:47.352
If he'd lost his key, he
would have just called.

22:47.387 --> 22:51.924
I noticed the lock was missing when
I made my rounds Sunday afternoon.

22:51.958 --> 22:54.093
I called and left Rich
a voice message, but ...

22:54.127 --> 22:57.796
- He never called you back.
- No.

22:57.831 --> 22:59.098
Thank you for your time.

23:03.103 --> 23:05.204
The lock was broken before
our victim was killed.

23:05.238 --> 23:07.973
Mm-hmm.
Somebody's looking for that money,

23:08.007 --> 23:09.754
And Rich is dead because
they didn't find it.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.811
- CSRU get a print off the lock?
- Barely a partial.

23:12.879 --> 23:14.379
[sighs]

23:16.369 --> 23:19.238
I don't know what I want
more ... to find our killer,

23:19.272 --> 23:21.840
or for the air-conditioning
to come back on.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.408
What did you find at the graveyard?

23:23.443 --> 23:26.545
A broken lock and a duffel bag
with a couple old hundreds in it.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.413
So that's where he was keeping
his money all this time?

23:28.448 --> 23:30.082
The real question is where
did all that money come from?

23:30.116 --> 23:32.918
I ran the serials from the
cash his girlfriend brought in,

23:32.952 --> 23:36.088
and it wasn't reported stolen
or mentioned in any police report.

23:36.122 --> 23:37.556
<i>Nothing.</i>

23:37.590 --> 23:39.558
Well, nobody gets handed
$2.9 million for no reason.

23:39.592 --> 23:43.328
It's grown to $2.9 million.
The deposits started in 2009.

23:43.363 --> 23:44.997
He also opened more
accounts as time went on.

23:45.031 --> 23:47.532
How much did he start with?

23:47.567 --> 23:53.839
[sighs] Let's see.
In 2009, the interest was...

23:53.873 --> 23:58.076
Making $550 per week as a bartender.

23:58.144 --> 24:01.446
Well, he opened the
fifth account in 2010.

24:01.481 --> 24:05.884
<i>Subtract monthly expenses and rent.</i>

24:05.919 --> 24:08.220
Rich was living off his
income as a bartender,

24:08.254 --> 24:10.622
but he wouldn't have been
able to save anything.

24:10.657 --> 24:16.528
Which means he would have started
out with exactly $2 million.

24:16.596 --> 24:19.932
Nice, round number.

24:25.271 --> 24:30.943
Can't you just get a sign that
says "autopsy employees only"?

24:30.977 --> 24:33.312
We tried that, but it kept disappearing.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.947
[sighs] Where's Todd?

24:34.981 --> 24:36.281
Oh, when Dr. Isles said
you were coming down,

24:36.349 --> 24:38.917
- he said he needed to freshen up.
- No.

24:38.952 --> 24:41.553
Ahh! Ahh!

24:41.587 --> 24:44.056
Make it snappy, Maura.
Todd went to go freshen up.

24:44.090 --> 24:45.223
I don't know how long that takes,

24:45.291 --> 24:48.093
- And I don't want to find out.
- Okay.

24:48.127 --> 24:50.462
Our spectrophotometer shorted
out because of the heat,

24:50.496 --> 24:52.130
and we just got it back online,

24:52.165 --> 24:55.267
so I finally finished my analysis
of the water from the bathtub.

24:55.301 --> 24:57.069
This is tap water from the building.

24:57.103 --> 24:59.438
It's consistent with what you'd
get from the Quabbin reservoir,

24:59.472 --> 25:01.640
which, as you know, provides
water to all of Boston.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.508
Yep, so delicious.

25:03.576 --> 25:06.611
It also has all the compounds
that you'd expect to find in it ...

25:06.679 --> 25:09.648
barium, sodium,
cryptosporidium, etcetera.

25:09.682 --> 25:12.951
And this is the water that
the victim was found in.

25:12.986 --> 25:17.155
Did you find any other DNA in it,
or is just filled with more "-iums"?

25:17.190 --> 25:19.191
No to both, but what is interesting

25:19.225 --> 25:21.593
is actually what is
missing from the water.

25:21.661 --> 25:25.197
- It's too hot to guess, Maura.
- It lacks sodium.

25:25.431 --> 25:29.267
- It's been desalinated?
- Yes, and desalinated water

25:29.302 --> 25:32.104
is used in agricultural
irrigation, on ocean vessels,

25:32.138 --> 25:34.339
and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals,

25:34.374 --> 25:36.308
semi-conductors, hard-disk drives.

25:36.342 --> 25:40.245
So our killer could
be a computer engineer,

25:40.313 --> 25:43.682
a sailor, a farmer, a ... 
what was the last one?

25:43.716 --> 25:45.117
- Semi-truck?
- Semi-conductor.

25:45.151 --> 25:50.185
- I can't! It's too hot to think!
- Maybe you should just go home and rest.

25:50.220 --> 25:53.325
I can't! It's too hot there, too.
Wait. Your A.C. works, right?

25:53.359 --> 25:57.362
- Uh, well, yes, it works.
- Maybe I could stay at your place.

25:57.397 --> 26:00.066
Oh, well, I mean, it works,
but I don't actually turn

26:00.067 --> 26:02.501
- it on because I sleep ...
- I know, yes.

26:02.535 --> 26:05.070
Would you just please
turn it on tonight?

26:05.104 --> 26:09.408
- I suppose.
- Thank you.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.436
I'll bring you some PJ's.

26:12.590 --> 26:15.180
Uh...
and if Todd comes back,

26:15.248 --> 26:20.385
tell him that I'm staying at
"your house" tonight. [scoffs]

26:24.657 --> 26:28.093
[cellphone chimes]

26:28.127 --> 26:32.497
I drove to work today
in a helmet, leather jacket, and boots.

26:32.532 --> 26:36.168
Ah, there's some pretty sweet
convertibles on Autotrader.Com.

26:36.202 --> 26:39.271
Convertible?
Do I need to remind you how impractical

26:39.305 --> 26:41.106
a convertible would be in
Boston eight months of the year?

26:41.174 --> 26:44.158
It's not like my motorcycle's
any more practical.

26:44.844 --> 26:47.279
I can't believe there's still no A.C..

26:47.313 --> 26:50.082
If I wanted to work in these
conditions, I'd be a baker.

26:50.149 --> 26:53.552
- No, you wouldn't.
- No, I wouldn't.

26:53.619 --> 26:57.155
- Is it still cool in your world?
- Yes, and crowded.

26:57.190 --> 26:58.723
I can barely start a Rokitansky

26:58.758 --> 27:01.393
without 50 sweaty
people watching over me.

27:01.427 --> 27:03.361
Well, they're so much better up close.

27:03.396 --> 27:04.629
[elevator bell dings] 
You think so?

27:04.664 --> 27:07.766
Maybe, if I knew what a Rokifransky was.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.201
[barking]

27:09.235 --> 27:10.535
<i>Frankie: Oh, come on. Get off of me.</i>

27:10.603 --> 27:11.770
<i>Korsak, would you get
this dog off of me?</i>

27:11.804 --> 27:13.538
Ack!

27:13.573 --> 27:16.842
That dog seems to be exhibiting
displacement behavior.

27:16.876 --> 27:18.176
[growling]

27:18.211 --> 27:21.079
- It's called "humping," Dr. Isles.
- You have to speak to him in Spanish.

27:21.114 --> 27:23.248
Oh, really? Want me to pant, too?

27:23.282 --> 27:24.549
- Hey, come on, shoo.
- I am serious.

27:24.584 --> 27:26.384
That is a Spanish-speaking dog.

27:26.419 --> 27:28.153
<i>Sientate.</i>

27:28.187 --> 27:29.688
[whimpers]

27:31.657 --> 27:33.225
<i>Muy bien.</i>

27:34.263 --> 27:37.362
_

27:37.363 --> 27:39.146
<i>Adiós.</i>

27:42.301 --> 27:46.138
Frankie: Anyway, I checked with the Feds,
but they didn't know anything helpful.

27:46.172 --> 27:50.142
Richard didn't have any experience that
would put him near that kind of cash.

27:50.176 --> 27:52.477
Hey worked at a bookstore
out of college, got laid off.

27:52.512 --> 27:54.579
Then he moved to the
mailroom at Chen Industries.

27:54.614 --> 27:56.381
- Chen Industries? 
- Chen Industries?

27:56.415 --> 28:02.220
- Yeah. What did I miss?
- Well, the C.E.O.'s son was kidnapped

28:02.255 --> 28:05.257
about six years ago, but I
never learned the details.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.625
All I know is that
the dad paid the ransom

28:06.659 --> 28:09.370
- and the kid was returned.
- So are you saying

28:09.405 --> 28:11.881
that our murder's
connected this kidnapping?

28:11.916 --> 28:14.626
I'd bet $2 million it.

28:42.251 --> 28:44.787
<i>Dr. Isles? </i>

28:46.322 --> 28:52.961
It's... Can you believe this heat?
It is so hot!

28:52.996 --> 28:56.298
Missed the ice-cream truck out there.

28:58.735 --> 29:01.203
Eric Chen, son of
billionaire Harold Chen,

29:01.237 --> 29:04.540
C.E.O. of financial giant
Chen Industries, was kidnapped.

29:04.607 --> 29:06.108
Official report says B.P.D. got a call

29:06.142 --> 29:08.110
from the boy's mother
reporting the kidnapping.

29:08.144 --> 29:10.546
Now, five days later, the
family put out a press release

29:10.580 --> 29:11.980
that Eric had been returned.

29:12.015 --> 29:14.550
- Was there any investigation?
- Uh, detectives kept trying.

29:14.584 --> 29:17.653
But after the initial phone call,
the family refused to cooperate.

29:17.687 --> 29:19.955
Guy's a billionaire who
runs a fortune 500 company.

29:19.989 --> 29:22.691
Paying a big ransom is the
fastest way to get his son back.

29:22.725 --> 29:24.026
Eric Chen also worked
at Chen Industries.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.727
Rich could have been
watching him for months.

29:25.795 --> 29:28.597
Rich was the inside man,
and he had an accomplice.

29:28.631 --> 29:29.865
They might have had an agreement.

29:29.899 --> 29:32.801
Rich would keep the money
in his family's mausoleum for six years

29:32.836 --> 29:34.636
while they waited out
the statue of limitations.

29:34.671 --> 29:36.271
It was a smart plan. They made it.

29:36.306 --> 29:39.975
- What went wrong?
- It wasn't up.

29:40.043 --> 29:41.877
<i>The statute runs out in three days.</i>

29:41.911 --> 29:44.279
That's when it will be six years
from when Eric was returned.

29:44.314 --> 29:46.315
So our killer wanted to
make an early withdrawal,

29:46.349 --> 29:48.750
and our victim didn't want to go along.

29:48.818 --> 29:50.586
No one ever talked
to Eric Chen about it.

29:50.653 --> 29:53.155
Maybe he can lead us to Rich's murderer.
Where's the kid?

29:53.223 --> 29:55.057
[beep]

29:55.091 --> 29:56.358
Not finding him.

29:56.392 --> 29:59.127
No DMV or bank accounts.
He's off the grid.

29:59.162 --> 30:01.428
Well, we'll start with Harold Chen.
I'll bet he'll be more

30:01.429 --> 30:05.133
willing to talk to us
if he knows we found his money.

30:05.168 --> 30:07.936
Where does someone
get $2 million in cash?

30:07.971 --> 30:10.939
Is there some special
teller window for that?

30:10.974 --> 30:13.742
You thinking of withdrawing
the Rizzoli family fortune?

30:13.776 --> 30:17.613
In order to get $2 million,
one must have $2 million.

30:17.947 --> 30:21.750
- Harold Chen?
- Boston police.

30:21.784 --> 30:24.052
We ... we'd like to talk to
you about your son's kidnapping.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.222
- I'm late for a meeting.
- It'll only take a second.

30:27.257 --> 30:31.827
It was a long time ago.
I've got my son back. He's safe now.

30:31.861 --> 30:35.130
- Our family's been through enough.
- We have reason to believe

30:35.164 --> 30:36.932
that we may have found
the ransom you paid.

30:36.966 --> 30:38.400
[sighs]

30:38.434 --> 30:40.269
I'm meeting with a company
that's going to invest

30:40.303 --> 30:41.837
hundreds of millions of dollars with us.

30:41.871 --> 30:46.275
If I'm late, I lose a
lot more than $2 million.

30:51.814 --> 30:53.382
[engine turns over]

30:56.119 --> 30:57.953
Well, that went well.

30:57.987 --> 31:01.690
Well, at least he confirmed
the $2 million was the ransom.

31:01.758 --> 31:04.960
They started at Chen
Industries at the same time.

31:04.994 --> 31:07.696
Same age with zero experience.

31:07.730 --> 31:12.801
Chen started as an executive,
and Nelson started in the mail room.

31:12.835 --> 31:17.005
- Nepotism sucks.
- I'm right here, Jane.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.774
I don't mean you!

31:18.808 --> 31:21.376
<i>Korsak: Yes!</i>

31:21.411 --> 31:23.979
What is that?

31:24.013 --> 31:26.348
It's a victory cha-cha.
I found Sipowicz's people.

31:26.382 --> 31:29.084
- Finally.
- Oh, congratulations, Korsak.

31:29.118 --> 31:31.320
Uh, excuse me.

31:33.156 --> 31:37.759
- You were with Mr. Chen earlier today.
- Yes. I'm his daughter.

31:37.794 --> 31:40.262
Well, I work for him, too.
[chuckles]

31:40.330 --> 31:42.945
- What can we do for you?
- I'd like to know if

31:42.946 --> 31:47.169
there's any new information
on who kidnapped my brother?

31:47.203 --> 31:50.939
Well, um, a recent case has
been linked to the incident.

31:50.974 --> 31:52.941
Getting any information
about the kidnapping

31:52.976 --> 31:54.109
would help us a lot.

31:54.143 --> 31:57.913
- Can you tell us anything?
- Uh, no.

31:57.947 --> 32:00.315
Eric didn't want to talk
about it when we got him back,

32:00.350 --> 32:02.517
and we didn't push him.

32:02.552 --> 32:05.187
Well, we'd certainly like to
hear his version of the story.

32:05.221 --> 32:06.855
Do you think you'll
catch the kidnappers.

32:06.889 --> 32:07.990
That's what we're trying to do.

32:08.024 --> 32:10.891
Can you tell us where he is?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.834
How long has Eric been here?

32:18.901 --> 32:21.370
Oh, he checked himself in
 about 5 1/2 years ago.

32:21.404 --> 32:23.338
I just assumed it was because he felt

32:23.373 --> 32:25.540
like the kidnappers
couldn't get him here.

32:25.575 --> 32:28.443
66% of people with mental
health issues never seek help,

32:28.478 --> 32:31.079
so the fact that your
brother checked himself in

32:31.147 --> 32:35.217
means that, deep down, he
really wants to get past this.

32:35.251 --> 32:39.488
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

32:39.555 --> 32:41.857
[door closes]

32:48.031 --> 32:50.832
Hey, Eric, it's Lucy.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.002
Eric?

32:54.037 --> 32:58.840
- Eric!
- Oh, sorry.

32:58.875 --> 33:02.411
There's some people here that ... 
they want to talk to you.

33:05.181 --> 33:07.349
Hi, Eric.

33:07.383 --> 33:10.519
I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
This is Dr. Maura Isles.

33:10.553 --> 33:16.324
- I'm busy right now.
- Okay.

33:23.599 --> 33:26.902
Have you ever been to the
top of Mount Wachusett?

33:26.936 --> 33:28.570
<i>That's what that is, right?</i>

33:28.604 --> 33:31.173
- Yes.
- Have you been?

33:31.207 --> 33:38.046
Once, a long time ago.
Before...

33:38.081 --> 33:43.418
- Well, I've never smelled air so fresh.
- Yeah.

33:43.453 --> 33:46.888
And the view?

33:58.634 --> 34:01.103
Eric, um...

34:05.675 --> 34:09.945
we ... we found one of your kidnappers.

34:09.978 --> 34:14.510
He's dead.
He was probably killed by an accomplice.

34:16.085 --> 34:21.022
If you'll talk to us, we think
that we can find that person, too.

34:22.739 --> 34:26.527
Uh...
I-I don't know.

34:28.431 --> 34:32.567
Eric.
You were denied the opportunity

34:32.601 --> 34:36.204
for us to catch your kidnappers before.

34:36.739 --> 34:39.474
Let us do that for you now.

34:39.509 --> 34:45.148
Talk to us, Eric.
Maybe we can make you feel safe again.

34:57.995 --> 35:01.097
What can you remember from
right before you were kidnapped?

35:01.132 --> 35:02.665
On Friday nights,

35:02.700 --> 35:05.402
a bunch of people would
go out drinking after work.

35:05.436 --> 35:09.372
The high-level executives loved
buying me drinks. It was fun.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.474
Before I knew it, I was really drunk ...

35:11.542 --> 35:14.744
- drunker than I'd ever been.
- You may have been drugged.

35:14.812 --> 35:18.548
I wanted to get out of there
before I embarrassed myself.

35:18.582 --> 35:25.455
I vaguely remember going outside
and asking someone to get me a cab.

35:25.489 --> 35:30.060
- It's cloudy from there.
- How many of them were there?

35:30.094 --> 35:31.861
There were two men.

35:31.896 --> 35:35.865
I thought of them as the
nice one and the jumpy one.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.601
Do you remember any
conversations they had,

35:38.636 --> 35:40.470
anything else about them?

35:40.504 --> 35:45.442
I remember waking up blindfolded
and tied to the chair.

35:45.509 --> 35:49.746
At some point, I talked to my dad.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.115
They made me tell him I was alive.

35:52.149 --> 35:55.585
Do you remember any distinctive sounds,

35:55.619 --> 36:02.592
- like a highway or bells, music.
- I heard horns.

36:02.626 --> 36:06.429
- Okay. Uh, car horns?
- No.

36:06.464 --> 36:09.699
- It sounded bigger than that.
- Like a foghorn?

36:09.733 --> 36:16.673
- Maybe.
- Okay. That's good. Um...

36:16.707 --> 36:20.443
Can you remember anything
else about where you were?

36:20.478 --> 36:23.179
Was it hot? Was it cold?

36:24.214 --> 36:29.486
It smelled.
I remember it smelled awful sometimes.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.457
- Can you describe the smell?
- It was like sewage.

36:34.525 --> 36:38.595
- That's all I remember. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

36:38.629 --> 36:41.498
<i>It's okay. You did great, okay?</i>

36:43.234 --> 36:45.602
<i>Okay.</i>

36:45.669 --> 36:48.037
Of all the people Rich called
the year of the kidnapping,

36:48.072 --> 36:49.606
a handful had records.

36:49.673 --> 36:53.143
One of them, Billy Skolnick,
was a roommate of his in college.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.845
Matches the sketch the
bouncer friend gave us.

36:55.913 --> 36:59.115
He's got assault and battery
charges, drunk and disorderly.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.851
He's also bought three
boats in the last five years.

37:01.919 --> 37:05.231
- They've all been repossessed.
- Guy really wants a boat.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.790
He was expelled from college
for stealing A.V. equipment,

37:07.825 --> 37:09.959
then started working as
a commercial fisherman.

37:09.994 --> 37:13.126
Eric didn't see where he
was being held, but he may

37:13.127 --> 37:16.499
have heard a foghorn, and he
said it smelled like sewage.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.835
The smell of low tide.
Probably up near the wharves.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.571
Uh, we have a partial print
from the mausoleum lock.

37:21.605 --> 37:25.575
I'll try to backwards match it
to the print from Billy's record.

37:25.609 --> 37:28.678
Fishing boats have equipment for
desalinating sea water for long trips.

37:28.712 --> 37:30.813
They use that water to
make ice for packing fish.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.583
Or for packing dead bodies.
Where is he now?

37:33.617 --> 37:35.585
[keyboard clacking, computer beeps]

37:35.619 --> 37:39.589
He works on a boat that docks next
to the East Boston fish market.

37:39.623 --> 37:41.291
So he must have showed
up ready to get his money

37:41.325 --> 37:43.493
and then got upset when
Rich told him he invested it.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.261
When he broke into the mausoleum
and saw it wasn't there,

37:45.296 --> 37:46.829
he just assumed his
partner ripped him off.

37:46.897 --> 37:49.132
[computer beeps] 
Fingerprint matches.

37:49.166 --> 37:53.670
- Let's go get him.
- No boat for Billy.

38:07.117 --> 38:11.221
<i>Excuse me. Looking for Billy Skolnick.</i>

38:11.255 --> 38:13.122
<i>Over there.</i>

38:13.157 --> 38:15.243
Freeze! Boston police!

38:19.812 --> 38:21.998
Move, move, move!

38:39.603 --> 38:43.406
Billy Skolnick, you are under arrest
for the kidnapping of Eric Chen

38:43.440 --> 38:44.874
and the murder of Richard Nelson.

38:44.908 --> 38:46.809
You have the right to remain silent.

38:46.877 --> 38:50.046
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.848
<i>[handcuffs click] 
You have the right to an attorney.</i>

38:56.086 --> 39:01.190
So the surviving kidnapper will be
in jail for the rest of his life.

39:01.225 --> 39:04.093
You checked yourself in here,
and you can check yourself out.

39:04.127 --> 39:07.363
There are fantastic outpatient
facilities for you when you're ready.

39:07.397 --> 39:10.867
- Okay.
- Eric?

39:30.988 --> 39:35.191
<i>♪ Right 'round the corner,
down by the canyon ♪</i>

39:35.225 --> 39:41.364
- Cold beer and cold wine.
- Yes, and yes.

39:41.598 --> 39:44.600
[indistinct conversations]

39:44.668 --> 39:48.070
So, Jane, I ran some lab tests

39:48.138 --> 39:50.740
on that sweat tea that
Angela's been pushing.

39:50.774 --> 39:53.789
And you realized it's disgusting.
Good job, doctor.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.078
Well, I noticed that after drinking it

39:56.113 --> 39:58.614
both Angela and Sipowicz
were exhibiting...

39:58.648 --> 40:02.318
- unusual signs of arousal.
- Ew, no, don't.

40:02.385 --> 40:04.120
Just ... just get to the point.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.489
Well, the main ingredient
is aji charapita,

40:06.523 --> 40:09.225
which is consumed primarily
in a jungle in Peru,

40:09.259 --> 40:11.393
and it is a potent aphrodisiac.

40:11.428 --> 40:13.763
<i>Angela: Hey, girls.</i>

40:14.564 --> 40:17.633
H... Hey.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.502
Up here. [chuckles]

40:19.569 --> 40:22.071
Yeah. So, you look great, Ma.

40:22.139 --> 40:25.541
What, a mom can't look nice?

40:25.609 --> 40:28.811
Angela, I have to tell you
something about that tea.

40:28.845 --> 40:31.147
I know you girls don't like it.

40:31.181 --> 40:32.414
- Yes.
- No.

40:32.449 --> 40:35.785
Well, I never tasted it,
but I have tested it in my lab,

40:35.852 --> 40:40.356
- and it's chemically enhancing you.
- In a bad way?

40:40.423 --> 40:42.525
- Yes.
- It's an aphrodisiac.

40:43.760 --> 40:48.564
[chuckling] Oh.
Oh.

40:48.632 --> 40:51.200
Well, how long will it take to wear off?

40:51.234 --> 40:53.435
I would say about two days.

40:53.470 --> 40:54.304
<i>Man: Hey.</i>

40:55.516 --> 41:01.844
- You ready to go, Angela?
- Yeah, well... [chuckles]

41:02.478 --> 41:06.849
...might as well make it count.
Shall we?

41:12.455 --> 41:17.226
- Maura.
- Mmm.

41:17.260 --> 41:20.329
- What is it?
- Mmm.

41:20.363 --> 41:23.132
<i>Caliente.</i>

41:23.200 --> 41:24.166
[snorts, laughs]

41:24.201 --> 41:28.170
<i>♪ oh, I love you so ♪
♪ hey ♪ [laughs]</i>

41:28.205 --> 41:31.841
I'm good...
No.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.309
- Try some.
- Mnh-mnh.

41:33.343 --> 41:36.812

41:36.847 --> 41:38.544
