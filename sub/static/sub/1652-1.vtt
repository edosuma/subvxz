WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:05.137
.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.106
- I don't know
where I'm going.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.509
- Just keep driving.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.745
- How am I supposed to hold
the wheel like this?

00:12.747 --> 00:14.313
I can barely steer.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.114
- You're doing fine.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.084
- Voight, there's got to be
a deal we can make.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.320
- Pull over up here.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.196
- Ow!

00:31.198 --> 00:32.798
[whimpering]

00:32.800 --> 00:35.134
- Come on, let's go.
- [screams]

00:35.136 --> 00:36.335
- Let's go.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.238
- [screaming]

00:39.240 --> 00:41.707
This is 4 grand,
if you just let me--

00:41.709 --> 00:44.710
Just let me go.
- Shut up. Come here.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.712
I got three dead kids
who od'd,

00:46.714 --> 00:49.348
So I'm asking one more time.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.083
Who's putting out
the bad dope?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.252
- I told you!
[grunts]

00:53.254 --> 00:56.288
- [grunts]

00:56.290 --> 00:59.324
- [groaning]

00:59.326 --> 01:02.227
[sobbing]

01:02.229 --> 01:04.396
- The name.
A name!

01:04.397 --> 01:07.699
- Rev.
His name is rev.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.603
He deals out of an apartment
on south emerald.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.107
[sobbing]
oh, oh.

01:22.282 --> 01:26.752
- Look at me.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.254
See that?

01:29.256 --> 01:35.227
The next trip you take will be
to the bottom of the river.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.629
Stay out of my city.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.668
Bus fare.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.440
[girl giggling]

01:48.442 --> 01:50.209
- Who's excited
for school today?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.310
- Not me.
- Knock, knock.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.678
- Who's there?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.680
Okay, photo day for liam.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.349
- Hey, that's not fair.
- Classroom fund for emmy.

01:57.351 --> 02:00.352
- Knock, knock.
- Who is there?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.754
- Which one's emmy?
- Emmy?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.223
- Hello, dad!

02:04.225 --> 02:06.258
- Emmy?
- It's me!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.326
- [laughs]

02:07.328 --> 02:09.161
- Got it. Got it.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.630
Keep reminding me, sweetie.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.766
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

02:14.768 --> 02:16.768
- Bet you're glad
I didn't say banana.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.337
- Close enough, baby.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.505
- What's up, willhites?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.340
- Hey.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.674
Million-dollar spaghetti
tonight.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.209
- See you guys.
- Oh, you're all sweaty.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.278
Looks like you just went
to the gym.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.713
- I won't tell you I just came
from the gym.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.382
- You're gross.
Get away from me.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.317
- I told you--I can get you
a 20% cop discount

02:32.319 --> 02:33.418
On a year membership.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.187
Morning, sunshine.
- Funny.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.322
- It's not the money.
It's the time.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.825
I got to take furlough
just to get my hair cut.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.494
[keypad beeping]

02:42.496 --> 02:45.564
- That stuff will kill ya now,
apparently.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.166
Saw an article online.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.234
- Well, that is last
on the very long list

02:49.236 --> 02:53.605
Of things
that I'm concerned about.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.909
- Please.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.377
- Caitlin was asking about you.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.947
- Oh, yeah.
Tell her I say hi.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.482
- So no interest on your part?

03:03.484 --> 03:06.485
- She's super sweet,
but my loss.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.353
- Hey, you guys seen
voight around?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.322
- No. Why?

03:10.324 --> 03:11.623
- Nothing.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.892
- You--I am never
setting you up again.

03:13.894 --> 03:18.964
- Because you don't know
a good thing when you see it.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.574 --> 03:29.408
- Got a name on that dealer.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.710
- Good.
Get him off the street.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.478
- Watch me.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.314
- Hey, hold up.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.349
- Sir.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.919
- Come on in.
Close the door.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.257
I'm just trying
to do the math here.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.925
A few months ago,
you work out a deal,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.428
Get yourself out of jail,
and somehow,

03:49.430 --> 03:51.797
You land the biggest job
in the city--

03:51.799 --> 03:54.333
Running an intelligence unit
in my district.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.335
- Yeah, things worked out.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.970
- I tell ya--
I got no choice to admit

03:57.972 --> 04:00.305
That, somehow, you are connected
upstairs in ways

04:00.307 --> 04:02.241
That I do not understand.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.909
- Hmm.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.979
- But, sergeant...

04:09.282 --> 04:10.849
Why the hell is a woman
named gradishar

04:10.851 --> 04:12.985
From internal affairs
calling me up about you?

04:12.987 --> 04:16.688
- You say gradishar?

04:16.690 --> 04:19.958
Never heard of her.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.432
- If you're still running game
out on the street, cowboy,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.601
Being a dirty cop,

04:29.603 --> 04:33.305
I will personally throw you
off a roof.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.014
- Commander.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.782
Atwater, burgess.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.051
- Yes, sergeant.
- Need you today.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.288
- You got it.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.528
- Pods showed me something
off the side of the road today--

04:56.530 --> 04:58.397
Confrontation off the dan ryan.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.032
- It was on camera?
- It was on camera.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.967
- Go.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.069
But not any longer?
- No.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.804
- I can live with that.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.740
All right, listen up.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.809
Got a name
on those dope deaths.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.346
It's a dealer named rev
on south emerald.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.447
As soon as olinsky gets here,
we're gonna--

05:15.449 --> 05:17.449
- Over here.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.450
Hey.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.751
- Hey, alvin.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.088
- Hank.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.057
- We're gonna set up
a controlled buy--

05:25.059 --> 05:27.392
Halstead and lindsay
in the doorway.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.729
Do not go inside.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.098
- Got it.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.400
- All right, one more thing--

05:35.402 --> 05:38.403
We've been doing this,
what, two months?

05:41.441 --> 05:45.077
Now more than ever,
we keep everything in house.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.946
Understand?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.581
I don't care how they run
other departments

05:49.583 --> 05:50.582
Or how you came up.

05:50.584 --> 05:54.786
This is intelligence--
my unit.

05:54.788 --> 05:59.691
You tell me the truth,
so I can lie for you.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.895
And if you ever go
over my head,

06:03.897 --> 06:06.498
It'll be the last head
you go over.

06:09.402 --> 06:12.704
Everybody goes home tonight.

06:19.479 --> 06:20.979
- You want to know
how you can tell

06:20.981 --> 06:24.916
When a nickname sticks?

06:24.918 --> 06:27.152
Ten years ago, the corner boys
on 16th street

06:27.154 --> 06:30.689
Started calling me pulpo,
the octopus.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.124
Why?

06:32.126 --> 06:33.825
Because I had my hands
everywhere.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.160
A drop on fullerton,

06:35.162 --> 06:37.095
A couple of soldiers
in humboldt park--

06:37.097 --> 06:38.630
I handled it.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.799
I started hearing the name
pulpo everywhere,

06:40.801 --> 06:44.803
From street dealers' mouths
to whores' lips.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.873
[chuckles]

06:52.145 --> 06:56.081
You want to know what
they call you behind your back?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.549
<i>Chismoso,</i>

06:57.551 --> 06:59.684
Because your tongue
is always flapping

06:59.686 --> 07:02.854
When it shouldn't be...

07:02.856 --> 07:04.589
Which is why I'm here.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.057
[inhales deeply]

07:06.059 --> 07:10.061
Ahh.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.431
<i>Acabemos con esto.</i>

07:12.433 --> 07:15.434
- [shouting]

07:23.209 --> 07:24.209
[coughs]

07:24.211 --> 07:26.445
[gasping]

07:31.117 --> 07:33.018
[screams]

07:34.053 --> 07:35.720
- Rev! Open up!

07:35.722 --> 07:38.023
- Hey!
You mind keeping it down?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.125
- Am I banging on your door?
No?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.727
Then go back inside.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.197
Rev, open up!

07:45.199 --> 07:48.567
- I'm going out on a limb here.
Rev might not be home.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.136
- Come on, man!

07:51.138 --> 07:52.137
- What?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.606
- Yeah, uh, is rev here?

07:54.608 --> 07:58.210
- No, so quit pounding
on the door.

07:58.212 --> 08:01.680
She's going
into rehab tomorrow.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.949
Wants to go out
with a bang tonight.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.152
Rev usually hooks me up.

08:11.724 --> 08:16.027
You ever been to rehab, man?
It sucks.

08:16.029 --> 08:20.632
- Come in.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.034
- We'll come back
when rev's here.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.169
- You've been up my ass
for two hours

08:24.171 --> 08:25.670
About scoring some "h."

08:25.672 --> 08:29.174
- Well, I changed my mind!

08:30.543 --> 08:32.910
- <i>Mujeres,</i> right?

08:35.147 --> 08:36.681
- It looked like blood.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.250
That and the fact
that we don't know that guy--

08:38.251 --> 08:39.650
- You don't have
to justify it.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.053
You got a bad hit,
you got a bad hit.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.789
- No. 'cause maybe it looked
like blood?

08:44.791 --> 08:46.758
That's not probable cause
to force an entry.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.093
- He could have been marinating
a chicken

08:48.095 --> 08:49.227
And spilled barbecue sauce
on his pants.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.097
Traced back to the heroin
rev's moving.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.100
You want to wait
for another kid to die?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.702
- We'll do a knock-and-talk,
all right?

08:57.704 --> 08:59.004
Whoever's in control
of the apartment

08:59.006 --> 09:02.207
Gets all squirrelly,
we'll take it from there.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.609
All right?

09:04.611 --> 09:05.944
- We're going back up.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.012
Stand by.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.647
- Tucked in
and ready to go, boss.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.948
- Barbecue sauce
as a marinade?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.850
What's that--some kind
of puerto rican thing

09:11.852 --> 09:15.120
- It's got too much sugar in it.
It'll burn the meat.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.657
[gunshots]

09:18.659 --> 09:21.660
- 10-1!
Shots fired at the police!

09:21.662 --> 09:23.061
10-1, 5600 emerald!

09:23.063 --> 09:25.997
Plainclothes officers
at the scene!

09:25.999 --> 09:29.568
- Get the long guns!

09:31.704 --> 09:36.608
[siren wailing]

09:50.189 --> 09:52.057
- Get back inside!
Go back upstairs!

09:52.059 --> 09:55.026
- All right, man.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.602
- Police! Clear!

10:03.604 --> 10:05.370
- Clear!

10:05.372 --> 10:07.672
- Body!

10:11.243 --> 10:13.011
- That's rev in the john.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.247
- Offender must have booked.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.149
- Call it in.
Clear the rest of the building.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.150
Shooter's in the wind.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.186
[thump]

10:21.188 --> 10:48.246
.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.849
- Take him upstairs.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.220
- Beheading--
that's a signature cartel move.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.888
- Yeah.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.224
Lindsay, put together
a description of the guy

10:59.226 --> 11:00.892
Who answered the door,
see if you can find him

11:00.894 --> 11:03.895
In any of our databases.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.964
- Hey, is your transmitter
all right?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.365
It cut out.
- Oh, yeah.

11:07.367 --> 11:12.070
Uh, banged up
against the wall.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.138
I'm sorry, jin.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.773
- Alvin, I'm gonna need
a fresh face

11:14.775 --> 11:16.775
In case we have someone pose
as a buyer again.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.678
- I'll pull someone
from the academy.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.715
- I owe you one.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.851
- That's why you have backup.

11:32.224 --> 11:35.193
- Hey, platt,
anything on the shooter?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.394
- Still doing a grid search,

11:36.396 --> 11:38.463
Brought in the helicopter--
nothing yet.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.331
Lieutenant belden
from violent crimes

11:40.333 --> 11:42.434
Is looking for you.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.102
Hey, burgess.
Burgess?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.370
- Yeah.
- Come here.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.871
I got a job for you.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.339
Hit the morgue.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.742
D.O.A. Was brought in today
named ross herrfeldt.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.843
He's my cousin.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.378
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.213
- Thanks.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.149
He's got a diamond pinkie ring
on his left hand.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.285
I want you to get it for me.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.721
Ask for a guy named
dave bulhack down there.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.022
Tell him I sent ya.
It'll be fine.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.256
- I don't--
- it shouldn't be a problem.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.891
It's got a lot
of sentimental value.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.194
I need to get it before
the hyena in-laws move in.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.229
So go.
Take the thing and go.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.363
Go, go, go.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.998
- And how old is the kid?
- 13.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.366
- You can't interview him
without parental consent.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.901
- Dad's dead.
Mom's in jail.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.336
I notified d.C.F.S.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.305
- And they said what?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.040
- I left a message.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.374
- You know, running around
half-cocked in a gang unit

12:23.376 --> 12:25.210
Is one thing,
but being the boss

12:25.212 --> 12:27.779
Of an intelligence unit
is another matter entirely.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.315
- I run my squad
as I see fit, lieutenant.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.484
You do your detective work
how you want.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.252
- This is a joint investigation,
sergeant.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.388
We share all information.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.325
- I was gonna come to you.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.493
- Nah, we're a block
and a half away.

12:41.495 --> 12:43.394
My turn
to walk the mutt, besides.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.463
- So, look, I got
a business proposition for you.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.032
I throw these
full-package-type parties--

12:48.034 --> 12:49.868
Dj, games, the whole deal.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.303
Got a pretty steady crowd.
They follow me.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.139
Only problem is,
my venue fell through,

12:54.141 --> 12:56.374
And I'm thinking,
how about molly's?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.476
- Beheaded?
- Yeah, you believe that?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.311
So you can have the whole bar,

13:00.313 --> 13:01.946
And me and you
can split the door.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.481
- Whoa, wait.
Who got beheaded?

13:03.483 --> 13:06.084
I'll take care
of all the promotions,

13:06.086 --> 13:07.285
And I'll provide security
at the front.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.388
- Uh, it sounds complicated,
but, yeah.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.125
Just give me a flat $200,
and you can invite who you want.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.361
- Done.
- All right.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.096
Come on, pouch!
Come on!

13:18.098 --> 13:21.099
- I heard rev was looking
for a runner--

13:21.101 --> 13:22.467
You know, get his lunch
and smokes

13:22.469 --> 13:24.502
And lottery tickets
and stuff.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.372
So I went over there
to see if I could get the job.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.175
Someone knocked on the door.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.578
He went out of the room.
I heard yelling.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.248
And that's when I ducked
into that closet.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.218
- You're in our gang database,
d'anthony.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.420
We know you were
in the same crew as rev.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.422
Did he piss someone off?

13:44.424 --> 13:48.226
Was someone moving in
on his action?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.461
- You see
what happened to rev?

13:50.463 --> 13:53.464
- No.

13:53.466 --> 13:57.068
I heard it.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.271
- Are you okay?

14:00.273 --> 14:04.008
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.512
- What all did you hear?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.514
- There were three of them.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.982
- Did you get a good look
at them?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.985
- No, I hid as soon
as I heard yelling.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.221
- What were they saying?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.356
- I don't know.
Most of it was in spanish.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.425
- How about a name?

14:22.394 --> 14:24.095
- I don't know
if it was a name,

14:24.097 --> 14:26.998
But rev kept yelling out
"pulpo."

14:33.005 --> 14:35.173
- Can't be the same pulpo.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.510
- That's him.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.447
- Adres dias,

14:42.449 --> 14:45.116
Aka pulpo,

14:45.118 --> 14:46.618
The octopus.

14:46.620 --> 14:50.421
He's got dual citizenship here
and colombia.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.457
Me and jules had him
on our radar five years back

14:52.459 --> 14:54.392
When he was working his way
up from street enforcer.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.527
Didn't he beat
a double-murder rap?

14:56.529 --> 14:58.429
- The two key witnesses
were killed.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.465
- Was he cutting off heads
back then too?

15:00.467 --> 15:03.101
- No, he learned a thing or two
since he was in colombia.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.436
What part of the city
did he hold down?

15:05.438 --> 15:06.604
- Oh, see, that's the thing.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.339
He wasn't affiliated
with any faction.

15:08.341 --> 15:12.176
He was just in it for the money
and the blood.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.546
- Okay, you two,
in my office.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.286
You ever heard the expression

15:21.288 --> 15:23.621
"10% percent of the cops
do 90% of the work"?

15:23.623 --> 15:29.294
- Well, this intelligence unit
is part of the 10%.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.630
With that said, I appreciate
your aggressiveness,

15:32.632 --> 15:35.400
But you were instructed to do
an undercover buy

15:35.402 --> 15:39.470
I never told you
to cross the threshold.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.506
If you had,

15:41.508 --> 15:44.642
You and lindsay might not have
gotten out of there alive.

15:50.482 --> 15:54.352
You vouched for him.
Keep him in line.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.290
Let's go for a ride.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.493
- Who do you have?
- Gibson--

16:02.495 --> 16:04.028
Hands down the best cadet
we got--

16:04.030 --> 16:05.330
Super dedicated,

16:05.332 --> 16:07.131
No back talk,
no ball breaking,

16:07.133 --> 16:08.466
Aced the marksmanship.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.268
You need him when he's finished
with the academy?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.736
- I needed him
five minutes ago.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.038
- All right.
- You want to kill yourself?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.540
You know what?
I'll do it.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.641
I'll blow
your brains out, huh?

16:16.643 --> 16:20.144
Huh?
What do you think about that?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.214
- What the hell are you doing?

16:23.216 --> 16:26.284
- You said the goal was to get
the gun out of his hands.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.653
- We'll take him.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.456
- Hey, I got a couple of c.I.S
I can reach out to,

16:31.458 --> 16:33.024
See if they know anything
about pulpo.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.392
- Good.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.494
- Is that who we're going
to see, a c.I. Of yours?

16:36.496 --> 16:37.628
- Basically.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.629
- What the hell
does that mean?

16:38.631 --> 16:42.367
Either they are
or they aren't.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.401
- I got big plans for you.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.669
- Ah!

16:44.671 --> 16:48.539
- Stay here.

16:48.541 --> 16:52.543
- That's your big plan--
for me to stay in the car?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.679
What'd you bring me for, then?

16:54.681 --> 16:58.516
- You cheer me up.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.717
- Yay.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.688
- [clears throat]
what's up, maurice?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.757
- Let me guess...

17:05.759 --> 17:08.425
Rev.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.161
Wannabe shot callers, man.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.130
These fools want to grind it up
to sixth gear

17:12.132 --> 17:13.498
Before they even know
how to drive.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.465
- He got in bed
with a cartel?

17:15.468 --> 17:17.268
- Colombians.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.537
- The name pulpo
mean anything to you?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.406
- No.

17:21.407 --> 17:25.542
- Who in rev's posse
might know something?

17:25.545 --> 17:28.146
- He subcontracted
the transport--

17:28.147 --> 17:29.714
Some white dude named coop.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.550
- That a first or last name?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.718
- Look it up.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.622
What, I got to do everything
for you?

17:38.690 --> 17:43.061
I'm gonna need you
in a couple weeks.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.530
Direct some traffic for me.

17:45.532 --> 17:49.400
- You'll wait to hear from me
is what you'll do.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.537
What's the matter with you?

18:02.381 --> 18:03.481
[knock at door]

18:03.483 --> 18:05.216
- Eric cooper!

18:05.218 --> 18:06.551
Hey, coop, open up!

18:06.553 --> 18:09.620
- Pry marks.

18:09.622 --> 18:13.257
- Breach.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.592
- Police!

18:14.594 --> 18:16.427
Clear!

18:16.429 --> 18:18.096
- Clear!

18:18.098 --> 18:19.764
- Police!

18:19.766 --> 18:23.468
Clear!

18:23.470 --> 18:27.371
- The next head I see
better be pulpo's.

18:27.373 --> 18:35.746
.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.649
- Hi.
Um, is dave bulhack here?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.785
- He went home sick.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.887
- Oh, okay.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.723
Um, sergeant platt
from the 21st sent me.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.160
- Oh, that witch?
What does she need?

18:49.162 --> 18:53.131
- Well, a d.O.A. Was brought in
named ross herrfeldt,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.633
And we didn't get
the proper identifiers on him.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.670
I need to take some photos,
so we can cross-match.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.687
Ok--
um, this is embarrassing,

19:16.689 --> 19:20.191
But do you have
a barf bag or something?

19:20.193 --> 19:22.460
I got hit with a wave here.

19:25.631 --> 19:26.797
Sorry.

19:49.221 --> 19:50.755
- Just wait here.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.889
Hey, come here.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.424
Adam ruzek,
this is sergeant voight.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.792
- Hey, boss.
Nice to meet you, sir.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.327
- Ruzek--
I know that name.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.728
- Yeah, my dad, bob,
was a patrolman

19:57.730 --> 20:01.532
- I pulled him out
of the academy, not his old man.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.201
- What, did you work
with my dad?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.435
- Yeah, we were on the same...

20:04.437 --> 20:05.736
- Softball.
- Softball team together.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.438
We designed t-shirts,
if I'm not mistaken.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.240
- Yeah, boy, there's
some good living up in beverly.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.541
That's where
you were raised, right?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.742
- I split time
with my dad there

20:11.744 --> 20:13.578
And my mom
up in canaryville.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.845
- If d'anthony was right,
and he heard

20:14.847 --> 20:16.581
Three voices
in the apartment,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.316
Pulpo must have brought
two hit men with him

20:18.318 --> 20:19.750
From medellin.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.919
- All right, just get
all this information

20:21.921 --> 20:23.821
To lieutenant belden
in violent crimes.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.623
Hey, have we gotten anything
from his end?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.726
- Calls between rev and coop
yesterday--

20:28.728 --> 20:30.294
Only one other number
called 'em both.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.230
It's a pay-as-you-go drop phone,
signal's off,

20:32.232 --> 20:33.631
But it was purchased
at a cell store in greektown.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.367
- Take halstead.
Check it out.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.636
Hey, I want the canaryville
out of you,

20:38.638 --> 20:40.504
Not the beverly, huh?

20:40.506 --> 20:42.573
- You got it, boss.
Yeah.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.908
- Hey.
- Hey, man. Adam ruzek.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.643
- Antonio.
- Jules. Welcome.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.012
- How long have we worked
together--a month?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.880
I think it's time we could be
honest with each other.

20:49.882 --> 20:50.948
Wouldn't you agree?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.683
- No.
- Two things--

20:52.685 --> 20:55.820
One, you driving all the time,
I'm not down with that.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.954
- Seniority rules.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.022
- I've been on the job longer.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.590
- I've been
in this unit longer.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.827
- Okay, look, I feel like
a househusband.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.263
- Aw.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.865
What's the second thing?

21:07.867 --> 21:11.502
- What's the deal
with you and voight?

21:13.538 --> 21:15.940
- [sighs]

21:15.942 --> 21:18.743
[seat belt unbuckles]

21:18.745 --> 21:20.578
This stays between us.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.781
- Of course.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.684
- We went to prom together.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.720
[chuckles]

21:29.722 --> 21:32.290
- I mean, is he your secret dad
or something?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.658
Put it this way--
if I were to ask you out,

21:33.660 --> 21:37.762
- Any guy who needs to ask
my dad's permission to date me

21:37.764 --> 21:39.664
Should save himself
the trouble.

21:39.666 --> 21:44.435
- Uh!
Shake it, baby.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.704
- Watch yourself.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.673
- Yes, sir, officer, sir.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.442
[bell jingles]

21:51.444 --> 21:52.543
- A pay-as-you-go phone
was purchased

21:52.545 --> 21:53.811
From your store
in the last 24 hours.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.948
We're looking
for who bought it.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.717
- Yeah.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.687
A juan garcia yesterday,
paid cash.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.955
- Any other information
you can provide us?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.825
- No. We're not responsible
for background checks.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.794
- True, but it is
a fairly common name.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.795
You know, there's not a lot

22:10.797 --> 22:13.998
- You don't tell me
how to do my job.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.733
I don't tell you
how to do yours.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.968
- You're glen pearson, right--
the owner of this place?

22:17.970 --> 22:19.503
- That's right.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.038
- You know, it looks like
there's a glen pearson

22:21.040 --> 22:22.807
With a deceptive practice
and fraud charge

22:22.809 --> 22:24.975
For selling stolen merchandise
out of gary, indiana.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.477
- Oh?

22:26.479 --> 22:27.812
- That's a $25,000 extraditable
must-hold warrant.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.747
- Oy.
- What do you think--

22:29.749 --> 22:31.916
Height, weight match,
eye color too?

22:31.918 --> 22:35.686
- Yeah, but I don't know.
I hate to jump to conclusions.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.388
You know what?
I got an idea.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.923
Why don't we throw
some bracelets on him?

22:38.925 --> 22:40.624
We'll take him down
to the station, run his prints,

22:40.626 --> 22:42.660
And then we can be sure.
- I got a nanny cam up here.

22:42.662 --> 22:46.464
Get a picture of the guy who did
it--that's the best I can do.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.799
- Oh. That's great.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.035
- Great, yeah.
You're too kind.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.604
Knew that would work.
- Mm-hmm.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.906
Just got to figure out
who this idiot is.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.846
- Why don't you bring that ass
over to my place sometime, girl?

23:01.848 --> 23:04.515
I'll let you in.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.751
- [scoffs]
oh, let it go.

23:06.753 --> 23:09.887
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

23:12.023 --> 23:14.759
- Hey, come here a sec.

23:14.761 --> 23:15.893
- No, you're just trying
to get me

23:15.895 --> 23:17.628
With assaulting
a police officer.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.830
- Do you see a badge
on me?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.741
- Mm.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.844
- [groans]
- anybody else?

23:46.825 --> 23:49.927
- My hero.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.130
You're still not driving.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.701
- Again, I'm sorry
for your loss, sergeant.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.603
- Yeah, he was a deadbeat.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.072
I loaned him 500 bucks
for an above-ground pool

24:02.074 --> 24:03.441
He put in two years ago.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.575
Guess how much I got back.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.143
- I don't know.
- Guess.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.112
- Nothing?
- That's right.

24:09.981 --> 24:13.150
So julio's pawnshop
on west cermak--

24:13.152 --> 24:15.653
Ugh. It'll be closed
by the time you get there.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.988
So tomorrow ask for julio.

24:17.990 --> 24:21.759
Do not deal with his wife,
'cause she'll dick you down.

24:21.761 --> 24:25.763
I want $350
for this thing, minimum.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.799
- Okay, yeah, yeah, julio's.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.734
Got it.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.870
- Colombian authorities I.D.'d
this guy as omar rojas,

24:32.872 --> 24:36.574
- So rev was the boss.
Coop moved the merchandise.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.775
Who's the next
in the chain of command?

24:37.777 --> 24:40.945
Rev was only in town
from baton rouge for a year.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.546
There was no structure
to his crew.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.682
- And nobody's talking?
- Nope.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.217
- All right.
When olinsky gets in, you tell--

24:46.219 --> 24:49.753
- I'm right here.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.689
- Anything from your c.I.S?

24:51.691 --> 24:52.923
- No dice--
something about not wanting

24:52.925 --> 24:55.860
To have their heads
chopped off.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.228
- All right, get rojas' image

24:57.230 --> 24:59.129
Out there
with pulpo's citywide--

24:59.131 --> 25:01.632
All airports, train,
bus stations,

25:01.634 --> 25:03.934
And keep hitting the bushes.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.707
- You want to brief me
on any new developments?

25:09.709 --> 25:11.175
- I was about to ask you
the same thing.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.711
- If we came up with something,
you'd be the first to know.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.112
- This ain't
about who takes credit.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.515
End of the day, you can stand
in front of the cameras.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.817
But this is supposed to be
a joint investigation--

25:19.819 --> 25:20.818
Your words.

25:20.820 --> 25:24.855
Or any of your detectives
working this case.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.057
Now, what's
with the 13-year-old kid?

25:27.059 --> 25:29.093
- Still here.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.828
- He give you anything?
- Enough.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.062
- Okay, then kick him.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.831
- No, that's been handled,
lieutenant.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.099
Commander perry has given me
another day

25:35.101 --> 25:37.101
Till we get the offenders
into custody.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.870
It's for the kid's own safety.
- The law's the law, voight.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.305
I'm sure you left
that part out

25:41.307 --> 25:42.773
When you were doing a soft shoe
for your commander.

25:42.775 --> 25:46.877
Based on my conversation
with deputy chief hammond,

25:46.879 --> 25:48.679
If you're not gonna charge
this kid,

25:48.681 --> 25:49.780
Then notify his relatives

25:49.782 --> 25:54.184
And have 'em come
and pick him up.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.120
And the fact that I'm here,
once again,

25:56.122 --> 25:58.756
Explaining to you
basic police protocol

25:58.758 --> 26:00.691
Is a prime example
why people are reluctant

26:00.693 --> 26:01.859
To bring you into the loop

26:01.861 --> 26:04.862
During these type
of heater cases.

26:23.281 --> 26:27.818
- Your cousin renny's coming
to pick you up.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.588
- Now?

26:37.996 --> 26:40.664
- Copy that.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.866
- Come here.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.380
You know, I basically look
people in the eye for a living.

26:56.382 --> 27:00.651
You have a future beyond
this neighborhood, d'anthony.

27:00.653 --> 27:04.021
It's okay to want that.

27:04.023 --> 27:07.124
When you start to try
and get out,

27:07.126 --> 27:10.761
Whenever that is,

27:10.763 --> 27:12.096
You call me.

27:15.133 --> 27:18.235
[horn honks]
- let's go!

27:18.237 --> 27:27.978
.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.047
- Hey.
What's up, man?

27:30.049 --> 27:33.017
We had to pay full cover
at the door.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.718
- I'm running a business,
detective.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.053
- Atwater is the cheapest,

27:36.055 --> 27:37.855
I mean the cheapest guy
you will ever meet.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.657
We drove--wait for it--
we drove around

27:39.659 --> 27:41.759
For a half hour yesterday
looking for an atm

27:41.761 --> 27:43.127
That wouldn't charge him
a withdrawal fee.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.395
- And there's
a two-drink minimum,

27:44.397 --> 27:46.230
So start knocking 'em back.
I ain't playing.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.699
- Okay, then I want mine
in that cup.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.801
- Next time.
- Flight attendant.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.136
- Uh, yeah, three years,

27:52.138 --> 27:54.138
Waiting until I got
into the police academy.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.907
- Flight attendant?

27:56.909 --> 27:58.142
- You can break my balls
all you want,

27:58.144 --> 27:59.677
But I learned more
about crowd control

27:59.679 --> 28:01.945
And conflict resolution
and intimidation tactics--

28:01.947 --> 28:04.048
Traits that will serve me well
when you guys detail me

28:04.050 --> 28:06.083
Up into intelligence.
Hint, hint.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.284
- Oh.
- Oh. Wow.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.286
Okay. Noted.
- Thanks. How about you?

28:09.288 --> 28:12.456
- Oh, I just kicked around--
nothing glamorous.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.957
- You?

28:13.959 --> 28:15.392
- I was in the military.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.761
- You see any action?
- I did. Yeah.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.997
- Ever see anything
like you did today?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.034
I'm sorry. I--

28:24.036 --> 28:26.403
Forget I asked that.
That was a stupid question.

28:30.241 --> 28:34.111
- All right.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.213
Let's do this again.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.982
All right.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.051
- 200 bucks?
Wow!

28:41.053 --> 28:42.886
You realize if you split
the money at the door,

28:42.888 --> 28:45.255
We would have made five times
as much?

28:45.257 --> 28:47.291
- Yep.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.927
[phone vibrates]

28:49.929 --> 28:52.996
- [sighs]

28:54.933 --> 28:56.800
Hello?

28:59.337 --> 29:01.772
Where are you?

29:13.318 --> 29:17.287
[dogs barking
in the distance]

29:20.058 --> 29:24.995
- [grunting softly]

29:49.020 --> 29:52.089
- What happened?

29:52.091 --> 29:56.059
- They got pissed at me
for hiding in the closet...

29:56.061 --> 29:59.163
Said I should have backed
rev up.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.202
I want to get out.

30:05.204 --> 30:09.139
[crying]

30:09.141 --> 30:10.974
- Come on.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.146
- [claps hands]
hey.

30:16.148 --> 30:20.284
You working double-time now?
- Hey, dad.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.286
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.454
Oh, he loves it here.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.590
- A little too much maybe.
- It's fine.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.392
- I got to get him
into boxing, right?

30:28.394 --> 30:31.328
- When he's ten.
We talked about this.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.031
- Where's eva?
- Volleyball.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.166
Then she's got a sleepover
at a friend's.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.267
- Oh.

30:37.269 --> 30:40.003
All right.
Got to get back to work.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.271
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:41.273 --> 30:45.075
What about dinner tonight?
- Something jumped off.

30:45.077 --> 30:48.011
Do you remember pulpo?
- Yeah, that means shark, right?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.413
- Octopus.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.048
Girl, you got to work
on your spanish.

30:51.050 --> 30:54.051
- Okay, sure,
in all that free time I have.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.586
- Yeah, well,
he's back in town.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.888
Hey, come here.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.224
You're the best.
- You're better.

31:04.062 --> 31:07.097
- So how would this work--
you getting me out and all?

31:07.099 --> 31:08.999
- Leave that to me.

31:09.001 --> 31:12.102
And it may take
a couple days.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.038
I just need you to stay alive
till then.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.274
- What's in it for you?

31:17.276 --> 31:19.576
- You're a good kid.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.412
- I don't got to work it off--
like be a snitch or something?

31:22.414 --> 31:24.948
'cause that ain't happening.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.516
- No.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.990
- But if I wanted
to tell you something,

31:32.992 --> 31:34.458
Not because
you were paying me,

31:34.460 --> 31:36.159
But because I wanted
to tell you,

31:36.161 --> 31:38.061
That don't make me
no snitch.

31:38.063 --> 31:42.499
- Just two guys breaking bread,
having a conversation.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.369
- I don't see no bread.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.371
- It's an expression.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.612
- Okay, well, I heard
some of the older guys talking.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.185
There's gonna be
one more hit.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.588
- Who?

32:04.590 --> 32:07.057
- I don't know...

32:07.059 --> 32:09.393
But xavier would--
xavier green.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.695
He dealt for rev.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.097
[dialing]

32:25.343 --> 32:26.443
- Where's the money?

32:26.445 --> 32:30.113
They're looking for this.
- How'd they get a hold of you?

32:30.115 --> 32:33.383
- You signed--you weren't
supposed to sign out.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.185
- Well, that's something
that you neglected

32:35.187 --> 32:39.189
- Do not bring me into this!
- [scoffs]

32:39.191 --> 32:42.192
Sergeant, why are you breaking
my balls here?

32:42.194 --> 32:44.227
- 'cause you don't have any.

32:49.167 --> 32:52.502
- Ruth dwyer,
m.E.'s office--

32:52.504 --> 32:55.038
She's expecting your call.

32:57.743 --> 33:01.144
Before we can move in--
otherwise, we got nothing.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.713
- Yeah.
- All right?

33:02.715 --> 33:04.348
Now, if he starts accusing you
of anything,

33:04.350 --> 33:06.083
You throw it right back
in his face,

33:06.085 --> 33:08.118
Pissed off and indignant.
- Pissed off and indignant.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.286
- Those are
your two best friends.

33:09.288 --> 33:14.157
Is gonna hook you up with the
latest in radio transmission.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.692
Department's come a long way
since taping a wire

33:15.694 --> 33:17.661
To your taint.

33:20.331 --> 33:23.500
- What is that?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.168
- You run out of walkmans?

33:25.170 --> 33:26.737
- New guys keep breaking 'em.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.206
- Here.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.607
Just take your little key,

33:30.609 --> 33:32.576
Go to your little
special drawer,

33:32.578 --> 33:36.213
And get me something top shelf,
come on.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.083
All right.

33:40.085 --> 33:42.052
Don't get in the car,
don't go in the building,

33:42.054 --> 33:43.653
Don't go anywhere we don't have
any eyeball on ya.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.122
You understand that?

33:45.124 --> 33:46.556
- Understand that.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.326
- All right, and remember...
Cheeto.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.228
- Cheeto.
- Cheeto.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.230
- Cheeto. All right.
I got it.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.332
- It's your lifeline.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.670
- I want this back.

34:03.107 --> 34:06.176
- All right?
- Let's do it.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.514
[indistinct chatter]

34:17.088 --> 34:20.489
[sighs]
hey, what's up, gents?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.760
- Need something?

34:32.637 --> 34:35.405
- [clears throat]

34:37.475 --> 34:38.507
- How you know I'm selling?

34:38.510 --> 34:40.844
- A wild guess.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.679
I used to buy from cheeto
a couple blocks up,

34:42.681 --> 34:44.714
But I guess
he went on vacation.

34:44.716 --> 34:48.085
- Yeah, a long one.
How much you got?

34:48.087 --> 34:50.152
- $300 just for now.
- Cool.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.621
Cool, cool.
- Yeah.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.556
- You give me that $300 and come
back in, like, 20 minutes.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.658
- Oh, okay, mr. Drug dealer,

34:54.659 --> 34:55.692
I'll just give you
all my money.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.394
What could possibly go wrong?

34:57.396 --> 34:59.463
- Give me the cash, and then get
your skinny ass off my block.

34:59.465 --> 35:02.299
- Dude, I sell an ounce a week
up at uic.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.301
You want to sit here
and play barney badass with me

35:04.303 --> 35:05.502
And break me off
for 300 bucks,

35:05.504 --> 35:09.706
Or would you like to make
$2,000 a week?

35:09.708 --> 35:13.276
Huh?

35:15.179 --> 35:17.180
- I'll give you 4 grams
for $300.

35:17.182 --> 35:19.349
- No, no, no, no, no.
You'll give me 5.

35:19.351 --> 35:23.320
It better not be stepped on,
or I'm not gonna be back.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.622
- Listen, bro,
I need an answer,

35:25.624 --> 35:29.192
'cause I got a sociology midterm
in 34 minutes.

35:29.194 --> 35:32.195
I'm not even joking.
Huh? Come on.

What's the debate?
- Ain't no debate.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.902
I just know not to trust a word
that comes out of a cop's mouth.

36:11.904 --> 36:13.470
- We're trying to save
someone's life.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.906

Don't. He's ready.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.507
Them colombians try to make
a move on him,

36:17.509 --> 36:19.309
It'll be the last move
they try and make.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.577

36:28.486 --> 36:30.720

36:43.935 --> 36:45.835

for a shane cameron.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.671
Xavier says he's been in hiding
since yesterday.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.439
- Yeah, but he has a flop house
over on addison.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.574
Might be worth checking out.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.243

36:55.346 --> 36:57.414

and here I am.

37:21.272 --> 37:22.806
Oh, you want to know more
about that?

37:22.808 --> 37:24.908
It's gonna cost you
a couple of drinks.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.711

the kids and a juicy story--

37:27.713 --> 37:29.746
