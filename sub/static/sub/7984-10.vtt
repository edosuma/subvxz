The Gnomes come in peace,

(Allanon) The Ellcrys is dying.

As it sheds its leaves,
a demon army forms,

00:39.912 --> 00:42.629
preparing to unleash
its evil on our world.

Oh my God.

03:47.151 --> 03:49.535
Wil, what happened?

03:49.570 --> 03:51.320
You lost too much blood.

03:51.372 --> 03:52.405
I thought you were...

03:54.242 --> 03:56.709
But the stones brought you back.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.746
I guess you're a healer after all.

04:07.755 --> 04:10.923
Where is she?

04:10.925 --> 04:13.309
Uh...

04:13.344 --> 04:14.760
(sighing)

04:14.762 --> 04:16.928
She didn't make it out.

04:21.986 --> 04:23.402
We need to open it back up.

04:42.290 --> 04:45.424
Amberle!

04:45.460 --> 04:47.126
(Ellcrys) I warned you
your feelings for Wil

04:47.128 --> 04:48.627
would hold you back.

04:48.629 --> 04:50.796
You must be willing to let him go.

04:50.848 --> 04:52.715
There has to be another way.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.717
Oh, this is the only way.

04:54.769 --> 04:56.519
You must choose.

04:56.554 --> 05:00.189
You must choose to sacrifice yourself.

05:00.224 --> 05:01.941
I said no!

05:03.478 --> 05:09.031
I'm sorry, I can't, I just can't.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.233
Then you have doomed us all.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.289
Amberle!

05:27.051 --> 05:28.334
(panting)

05:36.511 --> 05:37.810
Hey, what happened in there?

05:38.930 --> 05:41.981
It's hard to explain.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.349
But you have the seed?

05:46.854 --> 05:48.771
But the last leaf has
fallen in Arborlon.

05:50.691 --> 05:52.525
The Dagda Mor is free.

06:24.275 --> 06:28.227
The Princess has emerged
from the Bloodfire.

06:28.229 --> 06:29.445
She's coming home?

06:29.480 --> 06:34.450
Yes, but the Dagda Mor is
aware of her presence.

06:34.485 --> 06:35.818
So we must prepare.

06:35.870 --> 06:37.703
I'll send word to the Scouts.

06:37.738 --> 06:38.871
Move the citizens to the tunnels

06:38.906 --> 06:40.039
and mobilize the army.

06:40.074 --> 06:42.908
That would be the wise
decision, Your Highness.

06:44.745 --> 06:46.505
I'm still not used to
people calling me that.

06:48.132 --> 06:51.931
Only a king knows the weight of a crown.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.087
30 years ago,

06:55.089 --> 06:57.223
I stood under very similar circumstances

06:57.258 --> 06:59.758
beside your father.

06:59.811 --> 07:01.611
Did you have any words
of inspiration for him?

07:03.181 --> 07:04.263
Don't fail.

07:15.443 --> 07:17.203
Anyone remember how to
get out of this place?

07:17.245 --> 07:18.444
I'm working on it.

07:18.496 --> 07:20.246
And when we do, how do
we get back to Arborlon?

07:20.281 --> 07:22.031
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.999
We're gonna make it, we just have to...

07:24.035 --> 07:26.368
(creatures roaring)

07:28.456 --> 07:29.922
Run!

07:37.794 --> 07:39.627
The Demons outnumber
us a thousand to one.

07:39.802 --> 07:41.085
We cannot beat them in the field,

07:41.087 --> 07:43.638
which means restoring the
Ellcrys is our only hope.

07:43.673 --> 07:45.423
Allanon assures me that
Amberle has the seed

07:45.475 --> 07:46.891
and is on her way.

07:46.926 --> 07:49.060
Slanter, your men will form a perimeter

07:49.095 --> 07:50.928
and push into the woods
beyond the Sanctuary.

07:53.016 --> 07:55.933
Commander Tilton and I
will take the Elvin army

07:55.985 --> 07:57.902
and fortify the Sanctuary itself.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.604
We'll be the last line

07:59.606 --> 08:01.166
of defense for whatever breaks through.

08:26.299 --> 08:27.882

08:31.521 --> 08:33.054
Help me close this thing!

08:34.307 --> 08:35.722
It's stuck!

08:35.775 --> 08:37.975
(creature roaring)

08:38.027 --> 08:40.227
Just leave it, we can outrun them!

08:41.898 --> 08:42.980
What are you doing?!

08:48.121 --> 08:49.236
Hey! No!

08:50.657 --> 08:52.206
I bought you some time.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.207
Use it!

08:53.242 --> 08:54.041
You can't do this.

08:54.077 --> 08:55.493
We have to go back together.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.078
No, you have to go back.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.045
Don't you get it?

08:58.081 --> 08:59.880
We all have a part to play.

08:59.916 --> 09:03.000
I'm doing mine, and now it's up to you.

09:03.002 --> 09:04.335
(straining)

09:06.339 --> 09:07.838
Wil, stop.

09:07.890 --> 09:10.508
No, I'm not leaving you here.

09:10.510 --> 09:11.509
That's insane.

09:11.511 --> 09:13.511
Wil, it's not up to you.

09:15.014 --> 09:17.314
I'll come back for you, I promise.

She wants us to go.

10:52.993 --> 10:54.526

10:57.200 --> 11:00.100
For the boy, King Ander's orders.

11:22.448 --> 11:23.932
I never meant to hurt you.

11:25.554 --> 11:28.022
It's okay, it's okay.

11:28.163 --> 11:29.529
How can I help?

11:36.204 --> 11:39.372
(whispers) I need you
to get me far away,

11:39.424 --> 11:41.374
somewhere where I can't hurt anybody.

11:43.044 --> 11:45.206
Bandon, I can't.

11:45.268 --> 11:48.402
Catania... do you trust me?

11:56.224 --> 11:57.807
Yes.

11:57.859 --> 12:00.727
Then, get ready to scream.

12:03.865 --> 12:05.231
(screaming)

12:09.287 --> 12:12.739
Give me the keys or I snap her neck.

12:17.579 --> 12:18.579
Now!

12:29.057 --> 12:30.590
Drop the sword.

12:33.561 --> 12:34.761
Step back.

12:49.077 --> 12:50.410
Just let us go,

12:50.445 --> 12:52.445
he's not going to hurt you.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.547
We can't get through, not on horseback.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.183
Not without them seeing us.

16:49.218 --> 16:51.135
No, there has to be a way.

16:51.187 --> 16:52.720
We have to get to the Ellcrys.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.140
All right, we'll need cover then.

16:56.192 --> 16:58.225
We need to find somewhere
safe to wait for dark.

17:02.114 --> 17:03.898
I know somewhere, come on.

17:49.278 --> 17:50.411
Thanks.

18:01.007 --> 18:02.673
Wil...

18:02.708 --> 18:05.009
It won't be long.

18:05.044 --> 18:07.544
I know, I just...

18:07.597 --> 18:10.598
I wanted to tell you that I...

18:10.633 --> 18:12.216
that I wish things could be different.

18:12.268 --> 18:13.851
You know, I wish we could...

18:13.886 --> 18:15.970
I wish we could have
met before all this.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.724
Hey... we made it.

18:22.028 --> 18:23.028
We're almost home.

18:24.196 --> 18:26.780
And when we finish this,

18:26.816 --> 18:28.816
when everyone's safe,

18:28.818 --> 18:30.150
we'll have all the time in the world

18:30.152 --> 18:31.485
to do things differently.

18:34.824 --> 18:37.291
But what if we didn't have time?

18:37.326 --> 18:39.576
Don't talk like that,
we're gonna make it.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.498
No, I know.

18:51.057 --> 18:52.139
I'm not afraid anymore.

18:53.592 --> 18:56.427
Eretria was right, this is my part.

18:56.479 --> 18:59.346
I know what I have to do and...
it's okay.

19:07.690 --> 19:09.690
But I need to tell you something first.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.827
Of course.
