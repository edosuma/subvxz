WEBVTT

00:03.828 --> 00:05.162
Hey, so I was thinking.

00:05.187 --> 00:08.790
Next we go oxtail ragu
and scallop crudo.

00:09.364 --> 00:11.251
Sounds awesome, babe.

00:12.037 --> 00:16.424
Maggie, you promised me we'd be
pre-kid Ben and Mags tonight.

00:16.548 --> 00:17.967
I'm sorry.

00:17.992 --> 00:19.690
- I'm trying, Ben.
- Really?

00:19.715 --> 00:22.117
Because you haven't even
touched your burrata and fig.

00:22.142 --> 00:23.598
It's just hard.

00:23.780 --> 00:26.266
I have been with Finn every
minute for ten months.

00:26.477 --> 00:28.727
It just feels weird
being apart from him.

00:28.799 --> 00:30.773
Like I'm being a terrible mom.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.008
That's... that's crazy.
You're an amazing mom.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.649
What if he's scared or lonely?

00:34.828 --> 00:37.396
Or he poops his diaper and he
has to sit in it for hours?

00:37.421 --> 00:39.086
Then we fire the babysitter.

00:42.446 --> 00:45.641
Fine. Just one peek.

00:49.137 --> 00:50.438
See?

00:50.468 --> 00:53.148
He's having a great time,
and you should too.

00:53.173 --> 00:54.920
Besides, Danielle is amazing,

00:54.945 --> 00:57.505
and her babysitting reviews
are off the charts.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.661
Where is Danielle?

00:59.886 --> 01:03.722
I gave her an extra 100
bucks to do the laundry.

01:04.941 --> 01:08.210
Then who is Finn rattling at?

01:16.171 --> 01:17.507
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:17.532 --> 01:19.319
Oh, my God! Call 9-1-1!

01:23.275 --> 01:25.868
Austin FD! Open up!

01:26.101 --> 01:27.476
Got anything from Dispatch?

01:27.501 --> 01:29.179
They're supposed to be
en route from dinner,

01:29.204 --> 01:30.476
but nobody can get ahold of them,

01:30.501 --> 01:31.702
so we got Animal Control coming.

01:31.727 --> 01:33.836
- All right, take it.
- All right.

01:35.423 --> 01:37.460
All right, let's find this nursery.

01:37.713 --> 01:40.423
Paul, Marjan, Mateo, you
guys look upstairs.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.656
Watch your step.

01:41.681 --> 01:44.010
We're dealing with a
5-foot rattlesnake here.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.674
Do you have a name on the babysitter?

01:46.699 --> 01:48.067
Danielle.

01:48.092 --> 01:49.891
Danielle!

01:49.916 --> 01:52.077
Whoa! Someone's a little jumpy.

01:52.102 --> 01:53.492
Well, yeah. I hate snakes.

01:53.517 --> 01:54.710
Well, you're Cowboy Judd.

01:54.735 --> 01:55.812
I thought you grew up with snakes.

01:55.837 --> 01:57.004
Yeah, that's why I hate 'em.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.775
Eyes on the ground, guys.

02:01.699 --> 02:03.759
You haven't seen a big scary
snake around, have you?

02:03.784 --> 02:04.784
Is he hurt?

02:04.809 --> 02:06.343
Check for swelling or puncture wounds.

02:06.368 --> 02:07.959
Nah, I'm pretty sure he just hates me.

02:07.984 --> 02:09.620
He's OK, but I think he pooped.

02:09.645 --> 02:11.080
Whoa!

02:11.105 --> 02:12.961
- Ooh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:12.986 --> 02:15.048
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- And I think I pooped.

02:15.073 --> 02:17.300
- Finn!
- He's okay.

02:17.325 --> 02:19.293
He's stinky, but he's okay.

02:19.318 --> 02:20.870
Thank you.

02:21.072 --> 02:22.708
Thank you so much.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.174
Sir, I wouldn't come any closer.

02:27.142 --> 02:28.283
Is he OK?

02:28.308 --> 02:29.870
Where's Danielle?

02:30.553 --> 02:33.394
- Where's your laundry?
- The basement.

02:34.797 --> 02:36.063
Cap.

02:40.070 --> 02:42.264
- Well, that's not good.
- Nope.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.898
Owners say there's a
crack in the foundation.

02:48.923 --> 02:51.213
They threw a tarp over it to
create a moisture barrier,

02:51.246 --> 02:52.781
looks like that's what drew the snakes.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.749
All right, Judd and I will go in first.

02:54.903 --> 02:57.440
Blast those little bastards
with some frosty CO-2.

02:57.465 --> 03:00.435
That'll give you guys
enough time to get inside

03:00.474 --> 03:01.659
and get her out in the bag.

03:01.684 --> 03:03.370
How far is EMS with the antivenom?

03:03.395 --> 03:05.913
- ETA is two minutes.
- You good to go?

03:05.938 --> 03:07.619
Hell no! Let's go.

03:45.988 --> 03:50.041
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:50.842 --> 03:51.968
All right,

03:51.993 --> 03:54.257
let's keep things moving right along.

03:54.282 --> 03:56.532
Who's next on the mic?

03:57.568 --> 04:00.051
Would you stop being such a
wuss and get up there already?

04:00.076 --> 04:03.351
I'm not being a wuss. I'm
just waiting for my moment.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.896
We've been waiting for your moment

04:04.921 --> 04:06.209
for three hours.

04:06.349 --> 04:09.413
- That guy was good.
- Yes, and so are you.

04:09.529 --> 04:11.352
It's one thing to sing in the shower,

04:11.377 --> 04:12.620
it's another thing to sing

04:12.645 --> 04:14.014
in front of a whole room of people.

04:14.039 --> 04:16.574
Yeah. You're clothed for one.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.970
Iris, come on. Don't push.

04:19.111 --> 04:21.389
- I'm just nervous.
- You're nervous?

04:21.523 --> 04:23.635
The other day, you
plugged a dude's artery

04:23.660 --> 04:27.521
with your finger, but a roomful
of hipsters makes you nervous?

04:29.018 --> 04:31.858
Maybe I'm not the only
one who gets nervous.

04:32.258 --> 04:34.928
You have a beautiful voice.
You should share it.

04:34.953 --> 04:36.742
You're my sister. You have to say that.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.616
That's true.

04:40.599 --> 04:41.767
What?

04:41.859 --> 04:43.898
I missed a bunch of texts from Dustin.

04:43.969 --> 04:45.570
So? Just say you're with me.

04:45.595 --> 04:46.812
He knows I'm with you.

04:46.837 --> 04:49.131
He just wants to know how long I'll be.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.836
Wow. He's really got you trained.

04:53.192 --> 04:54.923
I know what you think, okay?

04:54.948 --> 04:56.906
We just have a very intense connection.

04:56.931 --> 04:58.632
Well, if you have such
a strong connection,

04:58.657 --> 05:00.470
why don't you just tell him you're busy?

05:00.751 --> 05:02.160
Yeah, watching my sister

05:02.185 --> 05:04.237
chicken wire gravy spoon ribbon pole.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.602
What?

05:07.119 --> 05:09.036
Watching you chicken out!

05:09.084 --> 05:11.418
I think someone's had a
little too much tequila,

05:11.443 --> 05:13.479
- if you ask me.
- Yeah.

05:13.504 --> 05:15.277
Listen, if you go up next,

05:15.302 --> 05:16.875
I'll stop running up your bar tab.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.031
I don't know.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.023
I think we should have another drink.

05:21.048 --> 05:23.039
Your call.

05:23.064 --> 05:24.704
Wuss.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.146
You doing okay, chica?

05:30.977 --> 05:32.919
Not even close.

05:35.673 --> 05:36.715
Hey.

05:39.703 --> 05:41.504
Whatever happens in there...

05:41.585 --> 05:43.180
I know. I know.

05:44.347 --> 05:47.718
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.029
Here we go.

06:15.031 --> 06:17.788
We're still processing
the truck for evidence,

06:17.813 --> 06:20.675
but we found a few items we'd
like you to take a look at.

06:20.743 --> 06:23.312
And what about Iris and that guy, Wade?

06:23.686 --> 06:26.578
We found some skeletal
remains in the vehicle

06:26.603 --> 06:28.455
and in the surrounding area.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.394
Animal activity spread
things pretty wide.

06:31.419 --> 06:33.441
Forensics thinks as many as four people

06:33.466 --> 06:35.440
may have been in that truck.

06:35.465 --> 06:37.098
Now, it's gonna take some time

06:37.123 --> 06:38.910
to match any DNA on those remains,

06:38.935 --> 06:43.074
but there were traces of blood
in that truck, quite a lot.

06:43.606 --> 06:45.993
Those results should come back sooner.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.035
In the meantime,

06:48.060 --> 06:51.931
these items were also found
in the truck or nearby.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.906
Michelle, can you please
come and take a look

06:56.931 --> 06:58.687
and see if you recognize anything?

06:58.712 --> 07:01.248
Anything that could
have belonged to Iris?

07:04.860 --> 07:06.430
Take your time.

07:07.971 --> 07:09.474
No.

07:10.143 --> 07:11.861
Definitely not that.

07:14.946 --> 07:16.356
What about that phone?

07:16.440 --> 07:18.775
Does that look familiar?

07:19.105 --> 07:21.820
No. It's not hers.

07:26.431 --> 07:29.285
- This.
- The bracelet?

07:29.594 --> 07:32.773
My dad got that for her
on her 14th birthday.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.291
She never took it off.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.570
I'll be honest, Captain Strand.

07:46.618 --> 07:48.297
There are some numbers
I don't like here.

07:48.322 --> 07:51.245
Your blood pressure's up.
Your glucose is elevated.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.437
Well, I've been going through
some stresses at work,

07:53.462 --> 07:55.567
and I may have been
hitting the cookie dough

07:55.592 --> 07:56.954
a little too hard.

07:56.979 --> 07:59.477
And you're sleeping
fewer hours per night

07:59.502 --> 08:01.069
than you were when you first moved here.

08:01.094 --> 08:04.116
Rebuilding a firehouse
is a full-time job.

08:04.141 --> 08:06.211
It doesn't really lend
itself to time off.

08:06.603 --> 08:08.172
I am concerned that

08:08.197 --> 08:10.199
you're burning the candle at both ends.

08:10.404 --> 08:12.339
Also, you shouldn't
be drinking on chemo.

08:12.364 --> 08:14.066
- Not even a little?
- Never.

08:14.608 --> 08:16.643
Doc, first you take my hair treatments

08:16.668 --> 08:18.543
and now you're taking my tequila.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.351
What about the cancer?

08:21.376 --> 08:23.044
Now the part I do like.

08:23.227 --> 08:25.854
This is a scan of your tumor

08:25.879 --> 08:27.977
when we began our treatment together.

08:28.118 --> 08:29.961
This is what it looks like today.

08:29.986 --> 08:32.288
Now it's hard to tell
with the naked eye,

08:32.313 --> 08:34.205
but the tumor has a circumference

08:34.230 --> 08:38.200
that is 2.77% smaller than
when you started this therapy.

08:38.378 --> 08:40.586
That sounds like good news?

08:40.611 --> 08:42.197
It's great news.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.860
And the fascinating thing is

08:43.885 --> 08:46.680
the reduction is almost
the identical average

08:46.705 --> 08:48.616
that we saw with your
canine counterparts.

08:49.378 --> 08:51.071
I'm sorry, my... my what now?

08:51.096 --> 08:53.097
The immunotherapy drug
cocktail that you're on

08:53.122 --> 08:54.539
is available only to humans

08:54.564 --> 08:57.541
because it was tested on
dogs with lung cancer first.

08:57.874 --> 09:01.130
You mean like caged lab dogs?

09:01.155 --> 09:03.557
Not at all. Canine patients.

09:03.582 --> 09:05.891
Their owners enroll them in these trials

09:05.916 --> 09:07.508
to give them a shot at a longer life.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.251
They come in for
treatments just like you.

09:09.276 --> 09:10.634
Most go home at night.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.807
You say some of them come home.
What about the other ones?

09:14.241 --> 09:16.309
Some don't have homes to go home to.

09:16.401 --> 09:19.437
It's not uncommon for some
of them to be abandoned.

09:19.462 --> 09:22.043
For those that are, they're
housed in a lab downtown.

09:22.068 --> 09:24.104
Uh, more like a kennel.

09:24.242 --> 09:27.529
Where I promise you they
are treated very humanely.

09:29.251 --> 09:31.783
C'mon, it has to be The Ring Two

09:31.808 --> 09:34.911
or Final Destination 2 or The Grudge 3.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.872
Man, those are some weak choices.

09:36.897 --> 09:38.565
Worst sequels of all time?

09:38.590 --> 09:40.641
The scariest movies of all time.

09:40.666 --> 09:42.855
All right, everyone knows
that the scariest movies

09:42.880 --> 09:45.164
are the ones where the
monsters are inside of you.

09:45.189 --> 09:46.998
The Shining. Dude was crazy.

09:47.023 --> 09:49.078
Or The Exorcist where
the demon's inside.

09:49.103 --> 09:50.906
Rosemary's Baby? Devil baby?

09:50.931 --> 09:52.699
- Yes.
- Cujo.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.889
Nah, bro.

09:58.342 --> 09:59.781
What?

09:59.806 --> 10:01.461
- Oh!
- Hey!

10:01.875 --> 10:04.567
I mean, that is a fine looking animal.

10:04.592 --> 10:07.619
Everybody, say hello to the
newest member of the 126.

10:07.644 --> 10:08.672
Buttercup.

10:08.697 --> 10:10.572
No way! You mean we get to keep it?

10:10.597 --> 10:12.976
- I'm dying of cuteness.
- Oh, finally!

10:13.001 --> 10:14.127
I outrank someone.

10:14.152 --> 10:16.012
Oh yeah, you think he's
gonna follow you around

10:16.037 --> 10:17.812
- and clean up after you?
- Good point.

10:17.837 --> 10:19.601
- Seriously, Dad?
- What?

10:19.626 --> 10:21.617
I begged you my entire life for a dog

10:21.642 --> 10:23.078
and you've always said no.

10:23.103 --> 10:25.093
We lived in an apartment in a high-rise.

10:25.118 --> 10:26.493
Who was gonna walk him?

10:27.691 --> 10:29.697
And what made you pick
this handsome fellow, Cap?

10:29.722 --> 10:32.325
This handsome fellow is
my canine counterpart.

10:32.350 --> 10:33.445
Oh!

10:33.470 --> 10:35.684
Yeah, he's definitely
got the signature look.

10:35.709 --> 10:38.683
He's also got the exact same
type of lung cancer as I have.

10:38.961 --> 10:40.463
Oh, no!

10:40.488 --> 10:42.020
That's so sad.

10:42.045 --> 10:43.688
Oh, come on. Toughen up.

10:43.713 --> 10:46.141
Buttercup's a fighter like me.

10:46.527 --> 10:48.821
And it's because of him.
And dogs like him,

10:48.846 --> 10:50.906
that I'm able to get my
immunotherapy treatments.

10:50.931 --> 10:52.039
Hey!

10:52.064 --> 10:53.819
His previous owner donated him

10:53.844 --> 10:55.746
so he was living at the clinic.

10:55.771 --> 10:57.352
They let me adopt him.

10:57.377 --> 10:59.663
Hey, TK! Say hello to Buttercup.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.414
Hey, Buttercup.

11:02.038 --> 11:03.695
I got stuff to do.

11:06.186 --> 11:08.688
Maybe you should've got him
a puppy when he was a kid.

11:08.713 --> 11:11.281
Actually, it was his mother who said no.

11:11.306 --> 11:12.550
Oh.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.032
_

11:15.057 --> 11:16.851
_

11:16.876 --> 11:17.876
_

11:17.901 --> 11:20.031
_

11:31.256 --> 11:33.024
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

11:33.049 --> 11:34.990
Uh, my name is Trevor. Come in. Come in.

11:35.264 --> 11:37.719
- Uh, Mother is upstairs.
- Sir, were you here

11:37.744 --> 11:39.282
with your mother when
her symptoms started?

11:39.307 --> 11:41.575
Uh, no. I came downstairs
to fetch her dinner,

11:41.600 --> 11:43.891
and then when I got back,
her color wasn't right

11:43.916 --> 11:47.169
and her countenance had started
to droop more than usual.

11:47.860 --> 11:49.664
- Can she speak?
- No.

11:49.689 --> 11:51.766
At first I thought she was
just being obstinate.

11:51.791 --> 11:53.094
Mother so loves to talk,

11:53.119 --> 11:56.177
but I really think something is wrong

11:58.086 --> 12:00.723
Mother, our friends are here.

12:02.056 --> 12:08.441
♪ Don't throw the case at me ♪

12:08.812 --> 12:11.567
Okay, she dead.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.612
Mother, I want you to do everything

12:14.679 --> 12:16.062
these nice people tell you.

12:16.087 --> 12:17.969
They're here to help.

12:18.350 --> 12:20.258
Does your mother have a heart condition?

12:20.283 --> 12:22.454
Yes, an enlarged heart.

12:22.479 --> 12:25.749
I always tell her it's because
she has so much love to give.

12:25.949 --> 12:27.251
Don't I, Mother?

12:27.276 --> 12:29.377
A boy's best friend is his mother.

12:30.763 --> 12:32.631
Trevor, can you sit down for me?

12:32.656 --> 12:34.215
What? Why?

12:34.263 --> 12:35.464
What's going on?

12:35.585 --> 12:36.969
Why aren't you guys helping her?

12:37.200 --> 12:40.722
I'm so sorry. Your mother's gone.

12:41.571 --> 12:43.474
What does that mean, gone?

12:43.499 --> 12:44.934
She's passed away.

12:45.287 --> 12:48.021
Probably a few days ago
by the looks of it.

12:48.105 --> 12:50.273
Is there someone that
we can call for you?

12:50.313 --> 12:51.695
What? No!

12:51.720 --> 12:53.226
No, okay, look, that...
that is impossible

12:53.251 --> 12:56.588
because she is resting.

12:56.613 --> 13:00.032
She was just singing along
to "After Midnight."

13:00.384 --> 13:02.053
I'm so sorry.

13:02.419 --> 13:04.500
Let's call the county coroner's office

13:04.525 --> 13:07.039
and get dispatch to send
a mental health unit.

13:07.064 --> 13:08.508
Okay, nobody is calling,

13:08.533 --> 13:12.477
and nobody's leaving
here until she wakes up.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.506
Uh, Trevor...

13:15.100 --> 13:17.134
believe me, I understand how hard it is

13:17.159 --> 13:18.969
to accept losing someone you love.

13:19.272 --> 13:22.138
And we are so sorry for your loss.

13:22.163 --> 13:24.565
I haven't lost anyone!

13:24.738 --> 13:26.893
Help her! That is your job.

13:26.918 --> 13:28.024
- Do it!
- Okay.

13:28.049 --> 13:29.679
What do we do here, Cap?

13:29.736 --> 13:31.230
Um...

13:32.672 --> 13:34.817
we check her ABCs.

13:41.553 --> 13:44.535
Her pulse is, uh, very weak.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.031
- What?
- 20mg of droperidol.

13:47.089 --> 13:50.195
- Droperidol for her...
- Just do it.

13:50.922 --> 13:52.646
Gillian, the Lifepak.

13:52.671 --> 13:54.670
We need to defibrillate now.

13:54.906 --> 13:55.933
Okay.

13:55.958 --> 13:58.217
- What?
- It's a Lifepak.

13:58.432 --> 14:01.031
Trevor, we need to remove
your mother's clothing now.

14:01.056 --> 14:02.461
Maybe you want to look away.

14:02.486 --> 14:04.320
I'm not sure she'd be
comfortable with you

14:04.345 --> 14:06.766
- looking at that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:06.791 --> 14:08.184
Tim.

14:08.746 --> 14:10.687
Right away, Cap.

14:12.319 --> 14:16.023
Charge is set to 150?

14:16.224 --> 14:19.031
Make it 300. We need this to work.

14:19.056 --> 14:21.865
- We really do.
- Copy that.

14:21.922 --> 14:23.458
On the count of three.

14:23.483 --> 14:26.094
One, two...

14:26.287 --> 14:27.707
- Trevor?
- Huh?

14:30.085 --> 14:32.653
- Okay, stay where you are.
- Get rid of it.

14:32.930 --> 14:34.252
Get rid of it.

14:34.786 --> 14:38.256
Tell dispatch to send the
Mental Health Unit for a 5150.

14:38.349 --> 14:39.917
Why did you do that?

14:40.060 --> 14:42.927
I'm sorry, Trevor, but you
didn't give me any choice.

14:42.952 --> 14:44.721
What about Mother?

14:46.492 --> 14:49.101
There isn't anything
anyone can do for her now.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.617
I promised to take care of her.

14:51.686 --> 14:54.897
And you did. You fought for her.

14:55.223 --> 14:57.317
In the end, that's all we can do.

15:10.472 --> 15:12.807
Hey Cap, I hope you
worked up an appetite

15:12.832 --> 15:14.918
'cause chicken fried steak
is ready in 20 minutes,

15:14.943 --> 15:16.627
with pecan pie for dessert.

15:16.652 --> 15:19.021
Hell yeah, I can feel my
arteries clogging already.

15:19.046 --> 15:21.258
Why would one fry a steak?

15:21.469 --> 15:23.070
'Cause it helps the batter stick.

15:23.095 --> 15:25.208
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

15:25.233 --> 15:27.263
Damn it. Where's that dog?

15:27.288 --> 15:28.973
Hey, dog! The dog.

15:28.998 --> 15:30.333
His name is Buttercup.

15:30.358 --> 15:32.310
Yeah, I'm not calling it that.

15:32.893 --> 15:34.646
Hey, you guys?

15:37.778 --> 15:41.520
Oh, someone has been a very curious boy.

15:41.545 --> 15:42.748
Oh, oh, oh.

15:42.773 --> 15:44.927
Guess we can take pie off the menu.

15:44.952 --> 15:47.388
Yeah, I guess this dog likes to
have his dessert first, huh?

15:47.413 --> 15:49.381
Nothing's dessert when
you never stop eating.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.286
That is not a chew toy. Leave it.

15:51.311 --> 15:52.779
From all the shoes you gotta choose,

15:52.804 --> 15:54.123
why you gotta pick mine?

15:54.148 --> 15:55.451
'Cause he likes ya.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.341
No, it's because he's messing with me.

15:57.366 --> 15:58.366
Look at his face.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.872
He thinks this whole thing is funny.

16:01.218 --> 16:02.451
Hey, no.

16:02.476 --> 16:03.842
No!

16:04.316 --> 16:05.551
God.

16:06.544 --> 16:08.576
Hey, yo, TK! Do not move.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.736
Buttercup dropped a bomb.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.529
Oh, gross!

16:13.913 --> 16:15.581
God!

16:16.629 --> 16:19.896
Why are you guys laughing?
That fuzzy thing is a monster.

16:19.921 --> 16:21.669
A firehouse is no place for a dog.

16:21.694 --> 16:24.216
What about the dalmatians?
They're like the firehouse OGs.

16:24.241 --> 16:25.505
Yeah, why is that, anyway?

16:25.530 --> 16:27.193
Because I think they're deaf in one ear.

16:27.218 --> 16:28.232
That can't be right.

16:28.257 --> 16:31.077
No, it was because they weren't
afraid of fire or horses,

16:31.226 --> 16:33.208
which pulled the
original fire carriages.

16:33.233 --> 16:34.888
They would just run ahead of everybody

16:34.913 --> 16:36.599
and warn the town that we were coming.

16:36.624 --> 16:38.191
Oh, so they were like the first sirens.

16:38.216 --> 16:39.406
Well, how cool is that?

16:39.431 --> 16:40.855
Okay, well, that partnership ended

16:40.880 --> 16:42.638
with the invention of the automobile.

16:42.663 --> 16:45.576
And that thing is not a Dalmatian.

16:48.395 --> 16:50.950
Michelle, thanks for coming down.

16:50.975 --> 16:52.877
What's going on? What are we doing here?

16:52.902 --> 16:55.352
Uh, I got something
I'd like you to hear.

17:01.843 --> 17:03.901
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

17:03.926 --> 17:06.362
I can't talk very long. I'm in danger.

17:06.387 --> 17:08.523
Ma'am, can you give me your location?

17:08.549 --> 17:09.880
I'm driving west on Adams,

17:09.905 --> 17:11.223
just part Guadalupe street,

17:11.249 --> 17:12.700
and I can see him like two cars back.

17:12.724 --> 17:14.333
He was outside my
apartment this morning.

17:14.358 --> 17:15.575
- What does he want?
- Ma'am,

17:15.599 --> 17:17.411
there's a police station
a quarter of a mile

17:17.435 --> 17:19.709
from where you are... do you
think you can drive there?

17:19.733 --> 17:20.840
No. No police.

17:20.866 --> 17:22.131
They'll kill her.

17:22.156 --> 17:23.656
Where did you find this?

17:23.944 --> 17:25.840
Is that your sister's voice?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.550
Yes.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.679
That was in the call history

17:31.704 --> 17:33.806
of the phone we found in the wreckage.

17:33.831 --> 17:35.850
But that wasn't Iris' phone.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.227
I think it was.

17:38.252 --> 17:39.544
That phone you showed me

17:39.569 --> 17:42.440
was like some kind of drug
dealer's burner phone.

17:42.465 --> 17:45.200
Or a phone used by anyone concerned

17:45.225 --> 17:47.528
with being followed or tracked.

17:47.647 --> 17:50.615
She sounds so paranoid.

17:51.206 --> 17:53.341
Maybe somebody was really following her.

17:53.366 --> 17:56.954
Michelle, I don't think anyone
was following your sister.

17:57.183 --> 17:59.169
This wasn't the only call to 9-1-1

17:59.194 --> 18:01.786
that came in from that phone.

18:10.216 --> 18:12.053
I wanna hear them.

18:15.530 --> 18:17.725
What do they want? They
won't leave me alone.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.341
They've got cars, and helicopters,

18:19.366 --> 18:20.895
and I think a drone.

18:21.026 --> 18:22.856
Damn it! Why won't they leave me alone?

18:22.949 --> 18:24.513
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

18:24.538 --> 18:28.027
Someone put a microphone
inside my filling.

18:28.052 --> 18:29.966
I'm sorry, where did you say

18:29.991 --> 18:31.224
they put a microphone, ma'am?

18:31.249 --> 18:32.249
My tooth.

18:32.274 --> 18:34.659
Their technology is sophisticated.

18:34.763 --> 18:36.318
These people are gonna kill me,

18:36.343 --> 18:38.080
you stupid son of a bitch!

18:38.105 --> 18:40.185
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

18:40.210 --> 18:41.911
Um, they won't stop until I'm dead.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.685
Ma'am, can you tell me where you are?

18:43.710 --> 18:45.669
I... I don't know exactly.

18:45.694 --> 18:47.460
We just left the Lost Cause bar.

18:47.485 --> 18:50.021
I'm in a truck, but I don't
think we can outrun them.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.677
Please tell my mom and
my sister I'm sorry,

18:52.702 --> 18:53.870
and I love them.

18:53.895 --> 18:55.411
I have to go! Please tell them.

18:58.815 --> 19:02.947
I... I think that the
kind of mental illness

19:02.972 --> 19:05.544
I suspect your sister was suffering from

19:05.569 --> 19:09.861
often doesn't present in
women until their late 20s,

19:10.079 --> 19:11.614
even early 30s.

19:12.047 --> 19:14.741
Dustin said she'd started to change.

19:16.858 --> 19:18.912
This makes so much sense.

19:19.706 --> 19:21.779
And it certainly would explain

19:21.804 --> 19:23.849
why she might've be drawn into the orbit

19:23.874 --> 19:26.168
of someone like Wade Caldwell.

19:27.135 --> 19:29.214
But he didn't murder her.

19:30.398 --> 19:33.676
I think what happened with your
sister was just an accident.

19:33.787 --> 19:37.347
A tragic accident.

19:40.674 --> 19:43.145
You got the blood work back?

19:45.997 --> 19:47.825
I'm very sorry.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.491
Happy birthday, babe.

19:57.617 --> 20:00.168
I can't believe it's
been ten years already

20:00.193 --> 20:01.695
since you've been gone.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.248
I miss you, Daddy.

20:08.026 --> 20:09.920
What's so funny?

20:10.095 --> 20:11.839
Oh, this. All of this.

20:12.068 --> 20:14.550
We're throwing a
birthday for a dead guy.

20:14.575 --> 20:16.744
Talking to a photo like it's people.

20:16.769 --> 20:17.818
It's hilarious.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.680
Iris, honey,

20:19.705 --> 20:21.810
yeah, I guess it is
maybe a little goofy,

20:21.835 --> 20:23.279
now that you mentioned it.

20:23.304 --> 20:25.139
Really, Mom?

20:26.445 --> 20:29.591
What's your deal? Are you on something?

20:29.616 --> 20:31.240
Why would you ask me that?

20:31.265 --> 20:33.943
Because you're acting weird
and you look like hell.

20:33.968 --> 20:36.943
Michelle, that's no way
to speak to your sister.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.154
So you're just gonna pretend

20:38.179 --> 20:39.990
like you're not seeing this too?

20:40.355 --> 20:42.209
Have you looked at her?

20:42.719 --> 20:45.859
When's the last time you
brushed your hair or slept?

20:46.157 --> 20:48.375
What, are you gonna start
following me now too?

20:48.493 --> 20:49.860
What?

20:50.242 --> 20:52.598
Iris, ever since you
started dating that guy...

20:52.623 --> 20:56.522
Dustin. Dustin has an IQ of 141, okay?

20:56.547 --> 20:57.539
He went to Dartmouth.

20:57.564 --> 20:59.666
You couldn't get into
freaking Texas State!

20:59.691 --> 21:02.367
Um, okay, I don't know
why that's relevant,

21:02.392 --> 21:04.234
and it's definitely mean.

21:04.541 --> 21:06.063
Listen, Iris,

21:06.088 --> 21:09.022
you're beautiful and kind and talented.

21:09.047 --> 21:11.578
Just don't let some guy
derail your dreams.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.438
Oh, you're gonna lecture
me about dreams, okay?

21:13.463 --> 21:15.190
You're the one who has
dreams being a singer

21:15.215 --> 21:17.883
but you're too big of a coward
to go up on an open mic night.

21:17.908 --> 21:19.710
So don't talk to me about
my boyfriend, okay?

21:19.735 --> 21:21.063
At least I have a boyfriend.

21:21.088 --> 21:23.036
- Iris.
- I'm gonna go.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.807
- Michelle!
- No, no, no.

21:24.832 --> 21:27.067
I think it's a really good
idea before I smack her.

21:27.092 --> 21:29.334
- We're having a party!
- I love you.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.752
Happy birthday, Daddy.

21:34.702 --> 21:36.258
And they're sure?

21:36.471 --> 21:38.038
The blood was a match.

21:38.263 --> 21:40.010
And what about her body?

21:40.409 --> 21:42.388
They still have to identify the remains

21:42.413 --> 21:43.781
that they found out there,

21:43.886 --> 21:45.809
and that's gonna take some time,

21:46.730 --> 21:49.144
but Iris was definitely in the truck.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.016
Well, who is that Wade person?

21:52.211 --> 21:56.115
Wade Caldwell. He was a bad guy, Mom.

21:56.270 --> 21:58.609
Why would your sister be involved

21:58.634 --> 21:59.734
with someone like that?

21:59.759 --> 22:02.296
A freaking criminal? A monster?

22:02.321 --> 22:04.857
It just... it doesn't make any sense!

22:05.457 --> 22:09.082
I don't think Wade Caldwell
was Iris' monster, Mom.

22:11.158 --> 22:14.169
I think the monster was inside of her.

22:15.178 --> 22:17.013
She had an illness.

22:17.308 --> 22:20.044
She was exhibiting signs
of schizophrenia.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.357
What?

22:21.382 --> 22:23.925
Mom, we both witnessed it.

22:24.154 --> 22:27.120
The jumbled speech, the
inappropriate laughter.

22:27.145 --> 22:28.322
The sudden bursts of anger.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.605
Oh, your sister was always moody.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.636
Mom.

22:32.661 --> 22:34.805
This was more than moody.

22:35.359 --> 22:37.110
This was something else.

22:37.604 --> 22:38.986
No.

22:39.074 --> 22:42.378
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

22:43.154 --> 22:47.077
She was sick and somehow I knew it.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.205
I knew it and then...

22:50.235 --> 22:52.343
I was so angry at her because of it

22:52.368 --> 22:55.659
that I... I ignored it,
and I ignored her.

22:55.684 --> 22:58.756
- That's not true.
- It is true.

22:59.005 --> 23:01.718
She called me so many times.

23:03.179 --> 23:07.056
That night she called and I just...
I didn't pick up.

23:09.883 --> 23:14.837
I could've saved her, but I didn't.

23:26.486 --> 23:30.207
Okay, your spot's ready!
Hop on up, buddy!

23:30.232 --> 23:31.910
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

23:31.935 --> 23:33.803
Hey, baby, come to Auntie!

23:33.828 --> 23:35.730
Everyone knows Auntie
has the best treats!

23:35.755 --> 23:37.144
Come on!

23:37.169 --> 23:38.800
That is totally cheating.

23:39.114 --> 23:41.785
Besides, everyone knows that
Buttercup is a jerky man.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.160
Ain't that right, boy? Come here.

23:43.185 --> 23:45.011
Somebody please turn the lights off.

23:45.113 --> 23:47.388
Also you guys are totally
embarrassing yourselves.

23:48.808 --> 23:51.683
TK's right. A good dog
don't need no bribe.

23:51.751 --> 23:54.378
They just need to come up
and feel who the alpha is.

23:54.403 --> 23:56.313
Buttercup, up!

23:57.397 --> 23:59.199
That's what I'm talking about.

23:59.372 --> 24:01.319
- You see that?
- Oh, man!

24:01.344 --> 24:03.488
You're breaking Auntie's heart.

24:03.570 --> 24:04.947
Hey!

24:04.972 --> 24:06.340
What? Hey.

24:06.365 --> 24:09.326
Get down. Get down, boy.

24:09.583 --> 24:12.486
Down! Get down, boy!

24:14.785 --> 24:17.299
Man, you're being a
dick to a cancer dog?

24:17.478 --> 24:18.813
That is not a good look, bro.

24:18.838 --> 24:20.518
What is your deal? Why
do you hate him so much?

24:20.543 --> 24:23.132
I don't hate him, okay?

24:27.751 --> 24:29.686
I think he's cynophobic.

24:31.042 --> 24:32.284
It's fear of dogs,

24:32.309 --> 24:35.018
usually stemming from a
childhood incident or trauma.

24:35.889 --> 24:39.316
Cesar did an episode about it.

24:49.308 --> 24:50.868
You don't quit, do you?

24:51.410 --> 24:53.036
I told ya.

24:53.679 --> 24:55.088
You're his favorite.

24:56.310 --> 24:58.993
Hey, you can fool everybody else,

24:59.018 --> 25:00.370
but you can't fool me.

25:00.395 --> 25:02.002
I know you love that dog.

25:02.027 --> 25:04.965
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

25:05.097 --> 25:07.733
You've loved every dog you've
met since you were two.

25:08.306 --> 25:11.014
Yeah, and you still bought him in here.

25:11.171 --> 25:14.975
This stupid brown-eyed,
slobbering thing...

25:16.535 --> 25:18.605
You knew I was going to
fall in love with it,

25:18.909 --> 25:21.838
and you knew that it was
sick, and it's gonna die,

25:21.863 --> 25:24.098
and I won't be able to take that.

25:25.447 --> 25:27.237
I can't fall in love with one more thing

25:27.262 --> 25:29.264
that I know I'm gonna lose, Dad.

25:31.515 --> 25:33.250
I can't do it.

25:33.576 --> 25:36.580
You can't make me fall in
love with this stupid dog.

25:37.153 --> 25:38.707
I won't.

25:42.143 --> 25:44.026
Yeah, I think this is
about more than the dog.

25:44.051 --> 25:46.347
Of course it's more than
about the damn dog!

25:48.681 --> 25:51.042
- You haven't lost me yet, son.
- Yeah, but I could.

25:51.067 --> 25:53.346
Yes, you could. You could.

25:53.654 --> 25:56.517
To cancer, on a call.

25:57.307 --> 26:00.471
I could be hit by a truck.

26:00.747 --> 26:03.774
There's no guarantees, not for anybody.

26:06.018 --> 26:08.237
This dog isn't a symbol of my death.

26:10.141 --> 26:12.157
It's an affirmation of my life.

26:15.647 --> 26:17.704
It's okay to love him,

26:18.958 --> 26:20.874
even though you might lose him.

26:24.531 --> 26:26.093
Here.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.925
Why don't you hook a brother up?

26:31.630 --> 26:34.167
You know I'm never gonna
forgive you for this, right?

26:34.564 --> 26:36.223
That's fine.

26:41.063 --> 26:43.409
Come on. Hi.

26:46.525 --> 26:48.235
I love you too.

26:49.268 --> 26:52.115
You're a good boy.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.703
Damn it, Amy.

27:13.728 --> 27:15.078
I gotta wake you up to show me

27:15.103 --> 27:16.722
where you moved the knives to?

27:19.685 --> 27:21.518
All right, fine.

27:43.565 --> 27:45.414
Amy?

27:53.602 --> 27:55.604
Come on.

28:08.060 --> 28:09.857
_

28:09.882 --> 28:11.701
_

28:11.726 --> 28:13.748
- Okay, sir. Tell me your name.
- Bruce.

28:13.773 --> 28:15.656
I can hear them outside the front door.

28:15.681 --> 28:18.099
They're... they're inside.

28:18.124 --> 28:20.919
What do I do?

28:20.944 --> 28:22.209
What do I do?

28:22.234 --> 28:23.987
Okay, Bruce, my name is Grace.

28:24.012 --> 28:25.480
We're not gonna panic, okay?

28:25.505 --> 28:26.959
What's your address?

28:26.984 --> 28:29.045
Um, it's, um...

28:30.752 --> 28:32.513
- Sir?
- Oh, God.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.467
Bruce, talk to me. What's going on?

28:34.492 --> 28:38.490
Glass. It's broken glass.

28:38.515 --> 28:40.083
The back door is open.

28:40.108 --> 28:42.410
It looks like someone came
in through there too.

28:42.435 --> 28:44.003
Bruce, I need your address

28:44.028 --> 28:45.830
so I can dispatch police
to your location.

28:45.873 --> 28:49.542
We're, uh, we're at the house.

28:49.567 --> 28:51.775
I can hear them down the hall.

28:52.225 --> 28:53.888
I have to do something.

28:53.913 --> 28:55.505
Bruce, you need to listen to me.

28:55.530 --> 28:56.999
If there are intruders in your home,

28:57.024 --> 28:58.516
you should by no means confront them.

28:58.541 --> 29:00.614
- Now, can you get out of the house?
- What?

29:00.797 --> 29:03.466
No, my wife is asleep in the back room.

29:03.715 --> 29:06.708
Please send help.

29:11.226 --> 29:12.794
Elliot.

29:12.933 --> 29:14.378
I've got a home invasion.

29:14.403 --> 29:16.083
Adult male claims two or more intruders,

29:16.108 --> 29:18.161
but he hung up before I could
get the address out of him.

29:18.186 --> 29:19.864
- You tried calling him back?
- No.

29:19.889 --> 29:21.513
I mean, if he's hiding on the premises,

29:21.538 --> 29:23.732
then I don't want to alert the
intruders to his location.

29:23.757 --> 29:25.849
I'd be nice if we knew
his location though.

29:25.874 --> 29:28.328
Well, he was calling from a cell phone.

29:28.353 --> 29:30.013
If you authorized the request,

29:30.038 --> 29:32.108
we could get the billing
information from the carrier.

29:32.133 --> 29:33.234
They'll give us what we need.

29:33.259 --> 29:35.295
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.864
Ma'am, just stay calm.

29:36.889 --> 29:38.263
Ma'am, did you see if the intruder

29:38.288 --> 29:40.157
has a weapon of any kind?

29:42.027 --> 29:44.370
You got a home invasion too?

29:44.932 --> 29:46.934
What is going on tonight?

29:48.246 --> 29:51.042
3-6-3-H-20. Come in.

29:51.382 --> 29:52.974
This is Officer Reyes.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.201
Officer, how close are
you to 7th and Channel?

29:55.226 --> 29:56.341
Close.

29:56.366 --> 29:59.009
Okay, we got a possible 10-62,

29:59.034 --> 30:01.554
home invasion on 843 Channel.

30:01.579 --> 30:04.192
Homeowner is Bruce Ackerman, 46.

30:04.217 --> 30:06.683
- Proceed with caution.
- 10-4.

30:31.210 --> 30:32.918
Did you find him?

30:33.052 --> 30:35.879
Dispatch, negative on
10-62 at this location.

30:35.904 --> 30:38.029
The caller, Bruce Ackerman,
was reported missing

30:38.054 --> 30:40.008
by his wife at 3:00 this afternoon.

30:40.469 --> 30:42.951
- Missing?
- Subject of a Silver Alert.

30:42.976 --> 30:45.505
Mr. Ackerman suffers from
early onset dementia.

30:45.530 --> 30:47.232
Wife says sometimes he wanders off,

30:47.257 --> 30:49.184
though he's never been
gone this long before.

30:49.657 --> 30:52.487
He sounded confused and disoriented.

30:52.512 --> 30:54.365
He thought he was calling from his home.

30:54.390 --> 30:57.568
Ma'am, stay calm. Police
are 12 minutes out.

31:00.053 --> 31:02.471
Officer Reyes, is Mrs.
Ackerman with you?

31:02.496 --> 31:03.496
She is.

31:03.521 --> 31:06.209
Okay, ask her if 1940 Birchwood Avenue

31:06.234 --> 31:07.483
means anything to her.

31:07.508 --> 31:08.954
10-4.

31:09.333 --> 31:10.832
Thank you.

31:10.857 --> 31:13.302
She says it's the address
of their first home.

31:13.327 --> 31:15.045
They haven't lived there in 15 years.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.238
That's my caller.

31:16.263 --> 31:18.465
This caller is a 65-year-old female.

31:18.490 --> 31:20.757
No, not her. Who she's calling about.

31:22.497 --> 31:25.203
- Zach, who has the gun?
- My caller's husband.

31:25.228 --> 31:27.640
They came home with their
grandson about 30 minutes ago.

31:27.665 --> 31:29.896
They heard some noise so they
locked themselves in a bedroom.

31:29.921 --> 31:32.108
The intruder's attempting to gain entry.

31:32.133 --> 31:34.396
The police are ten out.

31:34.825 --> 31:38.029
Okay, we need to dispatch fire
and medical to that location

31:38.054 --> 31:39.349
in case things so south.

31:39.374 --> 31:40.951
Zach, I'm gonna patch in, okay?

31:40.976 --> 31:43.537
Caller is is Marilyn Crump, 65.

31:43.562 --> 31:44.897
Okay.

31:45.334 --> 31:46.701
Mrs. Crump?

31:46.726 --> 31:48.994
My name is Grace. I'm a
dispatcher with 9-1-1.

31:49.019 --> 31:51.204
Where's the man I was just talking to?

31:51.229 --> 31:52.826
Why aren't the police here?

31:52.851 --> 31:54.240
They're on their way, ma'am.

31:54.265 --> 31:56.133
I'm giving you a fair warning!

31:56.173 --> 31:58.769
I am armed and I will shoot
if you come in here!

31:58.794 --> 32:00.130
I need you to listen to me.

32:00.155 --> 32:02.424
We have reason to believe
the man in your home

32:02.449 --> 32:03.816
is just confused.

32:03.841 --> 32:06.217
What? What, he's crazy.

32:06.242 --> 32:09.029
Well, he's ill. He's
suffering from dementia.

32:09.054 --> 32:12.324
He used to live in that house,
and he thinks he still does.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.623
I'm gonna try and contact him

32:13.648 --> 32:15.412
while we wait for the police, okay?

32:15.437 --> 32:17.814
Amy!

32:18.403 --> 32:22.053
Amy? Amy, are you okay?

32:22.078 --> 32:23.987
Amy, answer me!

32:24.443 --> 32:26.679
Amy!

32:33.016 --> 32:34.351
Hello?

32:34.435 --> 32:35.999
Bruce.

32:36.024 --> 32:37.834
Bruce, this is Grace,

32:37.859 --> 32:40.004
the 9-1-1 operator you
were speaking to earlier.

32:40.029 --> 32:41.154
Do you remember?

32:41.179 --> 32:42.716
Yeah, you were gonna send the police.

32:42.741 --> 32:44.646
- Where are they?
- They're on their way.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.553
Bruce, I need you to step
away from the bedroom door.

32:47.578 --> 32:49.095
Can you do that for me?

32:49.120 --> 32:51.682
No, my wife's in there. Amy!

32:51.707 --> 32:53.267
No, she's not, Bruce.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.352
We just spoke to Amy, okay?
And she's fine.

32:55.377 --> 32:57.429
But she's very worried about you.

32:57.454 --> 32:58.982
Where is she?

32:59.291 --> 33:01.107
We spoke to her at your home,

33:02.659 --> 33:04.110
I am home.

33:04.770 --> 33:07.990
No, Bruce. You're not.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.409
That's not your home, not anymore.

33:10.607 --> 33:12.827
It used to be a long time ago.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.693
Somebody broke in, the
back door was open.

33:15.718 --> 33:18.221
I think maybe it was you
who broke in, Bruce.

33:18.417 --> 33:20.002
Could that be?

33:20.419 --> 33:23.380
I couldn't... I couldn't find my key.

33:24.288 --> 33:26.545
That's right. That's right.

33:26.570 --> 33:29.720
Because that's not your
home anymore, is it?

33:30.030 --> 33:31.898
You wouldn't have the key.

33:33.374 --> 33:35.351
Oh, God. What have I done?

33:35.710 --> 33:38.604
You made a mistake, Bruce. That's all.

33:38.757 --> 33:40.689
But we're gonna fix it for you.

33:40.994 --> 33:44.056
I have some things I need
you to do for me, okay?

33:44.081 --> 33:45.907
Are you still holding
that knife in your hand?

33:45.932 --> 33:47.124
Uh...

33:48.818 --> 33:50.578
I needed protection.

33:50.603 --> 33:52.979
Of course you did, and that's okay.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.706
But the police are on their way,

33:54.731 --> 33:56.955
and I do not want them to
get the wrong idea, Bruce.

33:56.980 --> 33:59.583
So I need you to take that
knife and lay it on the floor.

33:59.608 --> 34:01.418
Can you do that for me?

34:01.443 --> 34:04.254
Yeah. Yeah.

34:11.018 --> 34:12.924
- I did it.
- Okay, good.

34:12.949 --> 34:15.585
Now I need you to go outside,
through the front door.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.833
Walk towards the street
with your hands raised

34:17.859 --> 34:19.795
so the officers can see
them as they pull up.

34:19.820 --> 34:22.773
I'm so sorry.

34:23.181 --> 34:24.684
I know you are, Bruce.

34:24.755 --> 34:26.306
Everything is gonna be okay, though.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.094
I promise you that.

34:54.937 --> 34:59.976
- I got lost, Amy.
- I know, but we found you.

35:00.001 --> 35:02.062
We found you.

35:13.409 --> 35:14.977
They got him.

35:15.002 --> 35:16.622
Amazing Grace.

35:16.647 --> 35:18.454
That's you.

35:19.638 --> 35:22.466
Ma'am, can you tell me is he breathing?

35:22.491 --> 35:25.310
No, I don't think so. He just collapsed!

35:25.335 --> 35:26.802
Okay, Fire and Rescue have already

35:26.827 --> 35:28.060
been dispatched to you, ma'am.

35:28.085 --> 35:29.224
They'll be on-site at any minute.

35:29.249 --> 35:30.632
Now do you know CPR?

35:30.657 --> 35:32.133
Yes. Yes, I did.

35:32.158 --> 35:34.260
All right, we're gonna
start compressions, okay?

35:50.539 --> 35:52.388
Possible cardiac event.

35:52.413 --> 35:54.279
I'm being told bedroom,
southwest corner.

35:54.304 --> 35:55.338
Copy.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.842
Austin Fire and Rescue.

35:59.867 --> 36:02.789
Please help! He's not breathing!

36:10.859 --> 36:14.008
- Is that a gunshot?
- TK! TK!

36:28.344 --> 36:30.024
The whole team is here.

36:30.299 --> 36:32.121
I tried to get them to go home,

36:32.146 --> 36:35.563
but Marjan's out there getting
them all hyped on caffeine,

36:35.588 --> 36:37.782
so I don't think they're going anywhere.

36:39.014 --> 36:44.080
I talked to your mom. That
was a fun conversation.

36:44.722 --> 36:46.991
She went into full lawyer mode.

36:47.381 --> 36:49.921
She practically deposed the doctor,

36:50.259 --> 36:53.047
asked him a million medical questions.

36:54.086 --> 36:57.594
The good news is he told her

36:58.000 --> 37:00.680
they were able to reinflate your lung,

37:01.790 --> 37:07.719
but, um, we won't know
about any brain issues

37:07.744 --> 37:09.563
until you wake up.

37:12.470 --> 37:15.153
But I told her not to worry, that her...

37:16.317 --> 37:19.734
beautiful, strong,

37:19.759 --> 37:22.535
resilient kid will be
on his feet in no time.

37:28.390 --> 37:29.959
TK.

37:31.673 --> 37:36.091
If you can hear me, I want you
to squeeze my hand, okay?

37:53.389 --> 37:55.658
Come back to me, son.

38:03.839 --> 38:04.995
Officer Reyes.

38:07.066 --> 38:08.831
Would you like some time with him?

38:09.466 --> 38:11.050
I don't want to impose.

38:11.198 --> 38:13.169
No, I think, uh...

38:14.720 --> 38:16.756
I think he'd appreciate it.

38:19.147 --> 38:21.262
I know I would.

38:29.707 --> 38:32.438
It's been awhile since I've done this.

38:33.247 --> 38:35.818
I'm not really sure if
I remember what to do.

38:38.446 --> 38:41.031
I could really use some peace tonight.

38:42.426 --> 38:45.913
Hey, I'm not interrupting, am I?

38:46.054 --> 38:47.766
No, not at all.

38:55.476 --> 38:57.897
- Are you okay?
- Am I?

38:58.148 --> 39:00.202
Yeah, your team told
me that you had some

39:00.227 --> 39:02.885
not-so-good news yourself today.

39:03.367 --> 39:05.820
I'm really sorry about
your sister Michelle.

39:07.925 --> 39:09.760
You're here checking on me?

39:09.914 --> 39:12.396
Well, yeah.

39:13.214 --> 39:15.815
You're a good man, Owen Strand.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.527
You saved my son's life.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.655
Any hope he has of ever...

39:23.942 --> 39:25.868
It's because of you.

39:28.319 --> 39:32.389
That boy is a survivor, like his dad.

39:35.524 --> 39:37.926
Thank you. Thank you.

39:42.006 --> 39:43.718
Um...

39:45.658 --> 39:48.098
It's the group I volunteer for.

39:48.594 --> 39:52.185
I think they'll be fine if you
let this one go to voicemail.

39:52.938 --> 39:56.413
I won't ever ignore a call from
someone who needs me again.

39:58.648 --> 40:00.918
_

40:01.739 --> 40:04.448
Michelle, you ready?

40:05.147 --> 40:07.700
- I think so.
- All righty.

40:17.630 --> 40:21.005
Next up, first time,

40:21.257 --> 40:24.327
here at the Bluebonnet.

40:24.459 --> 40:29.055
Miss Michelle "Blue Eyes" Blake.

40:30.901 --> 40:33.811
Ladies, come and help us out.
