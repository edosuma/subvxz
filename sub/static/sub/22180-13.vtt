WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:05.055
ELIZABETH: Let me try it again.
<i>Ayu-bowan.</i>

00:05.055 --> 00:07.122
Good, but don't forget the “U.”

00:07.316 --> 00:08.677
<i>Ay-u-bowan.</i>

00:08.677 --> 00:10.340
- <i>Ayubowan.</i>
- I don't...

00:10.364 --> 00:13.267
I don't get it, doesn't the Sri
Lankan president speak English?

00:13.268 --> 00:14.368
Oy.

00:14.369 --> 00:16.803
What? Am I being
culturally insensitive again?

00:16.804 --> 00:18.438
Because I screw up with Piper,
like, ten times a day.

00:18.439 --> 00:19.640
ELIZABETH: As a matter of fact,

00:19.641 --> 00:22.943
President Nandasiri
<i>does</i> speak English.

00:22.944 --> 00:24.378
But it's traditional
for foreign dignitaries

00:24.379 --> 00:26.880
to be greeted in their native tongue.

00:26.881 --> 00:30.649
And in Sri Lanka, the
primary language is?

00:31.652 --> 00:33.186
Sinhala. Okay.

00:33.187 --> 00:36.390
I've actually been practicing,
too, just in case.

00:36.391 --> 00:38.959
<i>Singhala Danna naa.</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:39.993
Which means?

00:39.994 --> 00:41.395
"I don't speak Sinhala."

00:41.396 --> 00:43.664
(CHUCKLES) Mom,
I'm actually very surprised

00:43.665 --> 00:46.533
that you're not delaying this
trip until Dalton is reinstated.

00:46.534 --> 00:48.735
Um, Russell told me that
he's gonna be back in action

00:48.736 --> 00:50.237
in, like, a few weeks.

00:50.238 --> 00:52.406
Well, while the president
is recuperating,

00:52.407 --> 00:54.474
it's important for the
international community

00:54.475 --> 00:59.112
to understand that the U.S.
has not missed a step.

00:59.113 --> 01:00.714
Which means...

01:00.715 --> 01:02.616
nothing is postponed.

01:02.617 --> 01:05.319
But if Acting President Hurst
signs off,

01:05.319 --> 01:08.188
you're just letting her
take the victory lap.

01:08.189 --> 01:09.072
I don't get it.

01:09.073 --> 01:11.625
You know, sometimes I worry that
Russell Jackson is your mentor.

01:11.626 --> 01:13.627
Yeah, you know, I, uh,
I hate to say it,

01:13.628 --> 01:14.861
but I think she's got a point.

01:14.862 --> 01:16.530
I'm not crazy about the optics.

01:16.531 --> 01:18.432
Kids, in public service

01:18.433 --> 01:20.767
and in life, it's not about
who gets the credit.

01:20.768 --> 01:22.836
Although, I got to say,
babe, that I know

01:22.837 --> 01:24.638
China's trying to make a
deal with Sri Lanka, too,

01:24.639 --> 01:25.839
and the fact that you
beat 'em to the punch,

01:25.840 --> 01:27.040
- that is really hot.
- JASON: Yeah, yeah. You know...

01:27.041 --> 01:28.542
- Oh, was it?
- ...and it's, uh, it's all part

01:28.543 --> 01:31.078
of a larger strategy to push
back on their expansion

01:31.079 --> 01:32.612
into the Indian Ocean.

01:32.613 --> 01:35.482
Okay, clearly, I talk about
work too much at home.

01:35.483 --> 01:37.918
ALISON: I'm home!

01:37.919 --> 01:40.120
- In the kitchen!
- Here. Oh, look at her.

01:40.121 --> 01:42.289
- Hi. Aw.
- Hi, guys.

01:42.290 --> 01:44.157
- You're back.
- I missed you.

01:44.158 --> 01:45.992
Okay, you guys saw me two weeks ago.

01:45.993 --> 01:47.961
- I don't care.
- JASON: Yeah, I...

01:47.962 --> 01:50.664
I didn't think you'd be home
until, like, spring break.

01:50.665 --> 01:51.998
I'll only be here

01:51.999 --> 01:53.133
for a couple of days.

01:53.134 --> 01:54.701
Yeah.

01:54.702 --> 01:57.771
Uh, small issue with your room.

01:57.772 --> 02:00.207
I'm actually kind of
using it as a gym.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.342
- What?
- Well, you know, I'm trying to get...

02:02.343 --> 02:05.045
swole for Piper.

02:05.046 --> 02:08.348
- Ooh.
- Gross! Do that in your own room.

02:08.348 --> 02:09.416
No, I almost threw out my back

02:09.417 --> 02:10.817
moving all the weights into yours.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.953
Okay, I'm gonna let
you handle this one.

02:12.954 --> 02:14.454
HENRY: All right. Come
on there, Jack LaLanne.

02:14.455 --> 02:15.722
- Let's go.
- Jack La-who?

02:15.723 --> 02:18.090
- Yeah. Come on.
- Bye. Love you. Really?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.461
Good day. Where are we on Indonesia?

02:21.462 --> 02:23.830
They love our soybeans,
we love their knitwear.

02:23.831 --> 02:25.399
Negotiations continue apace.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.667
The secretary's comments
at the Model UN conference?

02:27.668 --> 02:29.503
Uh, "May you continue
to be more functional

02:29.504 --> 02:31.204
than your real-world counterpart."

02:31.205 --> 02:32.406
In progress.

02:32.407 --> 02:34.408
(CHUCKLES) Okay,
our main event today is

02:34.409 --> 02:36.810
the Sri Lankan president,
Tarindo Nandasiri,

02:36.811 --> 02:38.445
arriving at the White House
to meet with the secretary

02:38.446 --> 02:39.613
and Acting President Hurst.

02:39.614 --> 02:42.516
With him will be his
minister of national policies

02:42.517 --> 02:45.719
and economic affairs, his chief
of staff, and his tasseographer.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.802
Lunch is scheduled...

02:46.803 --> 02:48.247
MATT: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, speedy.

02:48.248 --> 02:49.890
His tasseo-what now?

02:49.891 --> 02:51.324
Tasseographer.

02:51.325 --> 02:52.826
Someone who reads tea leaves.

02:52.827 --> 02:54.594
Like a psychic?

02:54.595 --> 02:58.031
His name is Ranuga, and he
prefers "metaphysical advisor."

02:58.032 --> 02:59.199
I'm sure he does.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.333
- (CHUCKLES)
- JAY: Let's just remember

03:00.334 --> 03:01.334
to be respectful,

03:01.335 --> 03:03.503
no matter what we personally believe.

03:03.504 --> 03:05.772
Which is that it's all just a bunch

03:05.773 --> 03:07.507
of pseudo-mystical nonsense

03:07.508 --> 03:09.309
designed to fool the gullible?

03:09.310 --> 03:10.744
KAT: Tasseography has been practiced

03:10.745 --> 03:12.312
for over 5,000 years, all right?

03:12.313 --> 03:14.147
You can't just discount it
out of hand.

03:14.148 --> 03:15.782
So you're saying
Ranuga's the genuine article?

03:15.783 --> 03:18.652
Oh, no, no. Him I'm
discounting out of hand.

03:18.653 --> 03:20.520
Yeah, I don't trust anyone
who sells out their talents

03:20.521 --> 03:21.555
to the highest bidder.

03:21.556 --> 03:23.123
And Ranuga only has one client:

03:23.124 --> 03:24.791
President Nandasiri.

03:24.792 --> 03:27.127
Got to wonder how much
he adjusts the message

03:27.128 --> 03:28.495
to keep the money flowing.

03:28.496 --> 03:30.664
Well, as long as he adjusts
his message on our trade deal

03:30.665 --> 03:32.165
to make President Nandasiri happy,

03:32.166 --> 03:34.134
- it's good for us as well.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.135 --> 03:35.569
ALISON: <i>Seriously,</i>

03:35.570 --> 03:37.971
you're not being fair.

03:37.972 --> 03:40.507
I know, but then my plans changed.

03:40.508 --> 03:42.175
If you want to go, you should go.

03:42.176 --> 03:44.578
Don't make <i>me</i> feel bad about it.

03:44.579 --> 03:46.279
Lucinda...

03:46.280 --> 03:48.215
Everything okay?

03:48.216 --> 03:50.116
- You heard that, huh?
- Yeah.

03:50.117 --> 03:52.085
I'm having roommate issues.

03:52.086 --> 03:54.254
Lucinda? Thought you guys were tight.

03:54.255 --> 03:56.423
We were. We <i>are.</i>

03:56.424 --> 03:58.625
Sometimes we're so tight,
I can't breathe.

03:58.626 --> 04:00.527
At first it was great. You know,

04:00.528 --> 04:03.597
we got along, we had a ton
of stuff in common...

04:03.598 --> 04:05.365
- What happened?
- Well,

04:05.366 --> 04:08.335
I joined a few clubs and
started making other friends.

04:08.336 --> 04:09.736
But Lucinda,

04:09.737 --> 04:12.572
it's like she just wants to
hang out with me all the time.

04:12.573 --> 04:14.374
Well, have you talked to her about it?

04:14.375 --> 04:15.942
She says she knows it's a problem,

04:15.943 --> 04:18.043
but she doesn't <i>do</i> anything about it.

04:18.045 --> 04:20.514
I just... need a break.

04:20.515 --> 04:22.749
(SIGHS) You think I'm
being harsh, don't you?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.384
No. (CHUCKLES)

04:24.385 --> 04:26.553
My first year in college,

04:26.554 --> 04:28.688
my roommate was so homesick,

04:28.689 --> 04:31.057
he cried himself to sleep every night.

04:31.058 --> 04:33.727
I mean, I-I liked the kid, but...

04:33.728 --> 04:35.862
(SIGHS) I felt uncomfortable,

04:35.863 --> 04:37.097
so I asked to be transferred.

04:37.098 --> 04:39.733
And then, of course, I
ran into him on the quad

04:39.734 --> 04:42.602
a couple months later, and
he'd joined the debate club

04:42.603 --> 04:43.904
or something, he had friends.

04:43.905 --> 04:46.039
It just took him a
little longer to adjust.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.676
I sort of felt bad that
I didn't hang in there.

04:49.677 --> 04:51.545
So you <i>do</i> think I'm being harsh.

04:51.546 --> 04:52.879
I think it's okay for you

04:52.880 --> 04:54.781
to want to spend time
away from your friend.

04:54.782 --> 04:57.716
Just remember to be kind, too, okay?

04:59.000 --> 05:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:14.000 --> 05:16.536
Mr. President, welcome
to the White House.

05:16.537 --> 05:17.971
It's a pleasure to meet you.

05:17.972 --> 05:19.372
The pleasure is mine, Madam President.

05:19.373 --> 05:20.941
Wonderful to see you again,
Madam Secretary.

05:20.942 --> 05:21.908
Mr. President.

05:21.909 --> 05:24.377
Uh, <i>ayubowan.</i>

05:24.378 --> 05:28.515
We had thought that Mrs.
Nandasiri would be joining us.

05:28.516 --> 05:30.183
She has flown to New York
to do some shopping.

05:30.184 --> 05:31.551
There'll be nothing
with a designer label left

05:31.552 --> 05:32.953
in the city by the time she is done.

05:32.954 --> 05:34.354
(CHUCKLES)

05:34.355 --> 05:36.189
(CHUCKLES)

05:36.190 --> 05:37.891
Ceylon tea leaves from our country.

05:37.892 --> 05:39.392
That's very thoughtful of you.

05:39.393 --> 05:41.428
Why don't we get out of
the cold and have a cup.

05:41.429 --> 05:43.063
That's a great idea.

05:43.064 --> 05:45.365
Mmm.

05:45.366 --> 05:48.802
You have many treasures in
your country, Mr. President,

05:48.803 --> 05:51.204
but I confess, your tea
might be my favorite.

05:51.205 --> 05:54.307
(CHUCKLES) We'd happily
give you a lifetime supply

05:54.308 --> 05:56.076
in exchange for use of that quote.

05:56.077 --> 05:57.777
(LAUGHS)

05:57.778 --> 06:00.080
May I have some more
leaves first, please?

06:00.081 --> 06:01.648
- Of course.
- Ah.

06:01.649 --> 06:05.619
Ranuga is going to
grace us with a reading.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.822
He will tell you things
about yourself you never knew.

06:08.823 --> 06:10.724
TERESA: I look forward to whatever

06:10.725 --> 06:11.758
you have to say.

06:11.759 --> 06:12.859
In truth,

06:12.860 --> 06:14.427
I say nothing.

06:14.428 --> 06:17.030
I am merely the earthly chalice

06:17.031 --> 06:18.298
the spirits have chosen

06:18.299 --> 06:20.600
to fill with their wisdom.

06:20.601 --> 06:22.002
They speak through me,

06:22.003 --> 06:26.805
that I may bring good tidings
to all who are in this room.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.543
Well, speaking of good tidings,

06:30.544 --> 06:32.912
we have some of our own

06:32.913 --> 06:34.547
regarding the trade agreement.

06:34.548 --> 06:38.752
Uh, my team has been negotiating
with Scott Goodman of KronicDM,

06:38.753 --> 06:41.655
and I've just learned
that he is on board

06:41.656 --> 06:43.323
and eager to get to work.

06:43.324 --> 06:45.358
I very much enjoyed his Super Bowl ad.

06:45.359 --> 06:47.294
(LAUGHS) - JAY: The other U.S.
companies we've contracted

06:47.295 --> 06:50.230
specialize in wholesale
connectivity. Wireless.

06:50.231 --> 06:52.732
But Scott will provide that
last mile of connection as well.

06:52.733 --> 06:55.602
TERESA: Upgraded landlines for
your homes and businesses.

06:55.603 --> 06:57.237
He's agreed to contract
out some of the work

06:57.238 --> 06:59.272
to the top three Sri Lankan telecoms.

06:59.273 --> 07:00.874
And there's some other
small changes, addendums

07:00.875 --> 07:02.275
- which we'll address...
- (CLEARS THROAT)

07:02.276 --> 07:04.277
(QUIETLY): Mr. President.

07:04.278 --> 07:06.312
What is it, my friend?

07:06.313 --> 07:08.847
(RANUGA WHISPERING)

07:12.052 --> 07:13.585
Are you sure?

07:16.056 --> 07:17.657
(SIGHS)

07:17.658 --> 07:20.427
I'm afraid, um, we have a problem.

07:20.428 --> 07:22.929
What kind of problem?

07:22.930 --> 07:26.833
The spirits have withdrawn
their blessings.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.868
We cannot move forward
with this trade agreement.

07:32.005 --> 07:35.108
WOMAN: <i>Thanks for scheduling
our call so quickly.</i>

07:35.109 --> 07:37.277
I have an asset in the Taliban.

07:37.278 --> 07:38.945
Someone I trust.

07:38.946 --> 07:40.847
He says a rogue splinter group
has broken off.

07:40.848 --> 07:42.282
They aren't happy with the deal

07:42.283 --> 07:44.784
the U.S. and Afghanistan
brokered with their leaders,

07:44.785 --> 07:47.020
and they're determined
to disrupt the peace.

07:47.021 --> 07:49.122
Did he say how?

07:49.123 --> 07:51.091
They've acquired
a major cache of weapons,

07:51.092 --> 07:53.626
which includes dozens
of surface-to-air missiles,

07:53.627 --> 07:56.129
and they intend to use them
on NATO helicopters.

07:56.130 --> 07:58.331
Nafisa, what do you need us to do?

07:58.332 --> 08:02.001
Sign off on using funds to
help counter the new threat.

08:02.002 --> 08:04.704
We'll have to read in
the Gang of Eight.

08:04.705 --> 08:05.905
We'll get back to you.

08:05.906 --> 08:07.907
Thank you.

08:07.908 --> 08:10.744
We're already over our Af-Pak
budget containing the Taliban.

08:10.745 --> 08:12.612
I'm sure the Gang of Eight
will be thrilled

08:12.613 --> 08:15.381
to authorize funds for this.

08:15.382 --> 08:18.752
I understand you have
great respect for Ranuga,

08:18.753 --> 08:22.155
Mr. President, but
is it possible that,

08:22.156 --> 08:25.024
in this particular
instance, he's mistaken?

08:25.025 --> 08:27.327
I do not have the skill
or the unique connection

08:27.328 --> 08:29.129
to the spirit world as Ranuga does,

08:29.130 --> 08:30.764
but he's never been wrong before.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.899
All we're saying is
that his gift appears

08:32.900 --> 08:35.168
to be one of... interpretation.

08:35.169 --> 08:36.302
Not at all.

08:36.303 --> 08:38.270
He's speaking for Nuveena,

08:38.272 --> 08:40.539
my late grandmother and
the matriarch of the family.

08:40.541 --> 08:43.042
Nuveena also had the gift of sight.

08:43.043 --> 08:45.478
Ever since I was a baby,
she told me that,

08:45.479 --> 08:47.147
one day, I would lead our people.

08:47.148 --> 08:48.381
And now I'm the president.

08:48.382 --> 08:51.751
I would never dream
do against her wishes.

08:51.752 --> 08:55.522
But if your grandmother wants
what's best for your country

08:55.523 --> 08:58.057
and its people, Mr. President,
this trade agreement

08:58.058 --> 09:01.327
will change so many lives
for the better.

09:01.328 --> 09:05.198
Perhaps Nuveena's telling me
that I'm moving too quickly,

09:05.199 --> 09:07.867
that I should open my eyes
and see what else is around us.

09:07.868 --> 09:08.868
Mr. President,

09:08.869 --> 09:11.671
if you mean the Chinese...

09:11.672 --> 09:13.606
China is our neighbor.

09:13.607 --> 09:15.875
They've invested quite a bit
in Hambantota.

09:15.876 --> 09:19.813
Because they want control
of your deepwater ports.

09:19.814 --> 09:23.817
Nuveena may feel that I was
too dismissive of their offer.

09:23.818 --> 09:27.686
If so, this would be the
time to reconsider.

09:33.359 --> 09:35.228
JAY: And this is the East Room,

09:35.229 --> 09:37.230
the largest room in the White House.

09:37.231 --> 09:41.067
It's primarily used for dinners
and press conferences.

09:41.068 --> 09:43.069
And roller-skating.

09:43.070 --> 09:46.506
I hear children laughing.

09:46.507 --> 09:50.276
I hear the wheels
slapping the wood floor.

09:50.277 --> 09:52.345
It's true.

09:52.346 --> 09:55.148
It's true that, uh,
Teddy Roosevelt's children

09:55.149 --> 09:58.685
and Amy Carter were known
to... roller-skate in here.

09:58.686 --> 10:01.721
Yeah, it's also true that that
information's readily available

10:01.722 --> 10:03.456
through newspaper articles, brochures,

10:03.457 --> 10:06.025
biographies, several documentaries,

10:06.026 --> 10:07.594
White House tours,

10:07.595 --> 10:09.495
and on numerous websites.

10:09.496 --> 10:13.466
Those are all ways
to receive information, yes,

10:13.467 --> 10:15.468
but they are not the only ways.

10:15.469 --> 10:17.570
There is so much more to the universe

10:17.571 --> 10:19.839
than that which we can touch.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.075
- Shall we?
- BOTH: Yeah.

10:22.076 --> 10:25.210
Who is the man with the "L" name?

10:25.945 --> 10:27.547
Uh...

10:27.548 --> 10:29.749
my brother's name is Logan.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.718
You are avoiding his calls.

10:31.719 --> 10:33.219
Uh, only 'cause he's boring.

10:33.220 --> 10:35.588
RANUGA: Next time he
calls, speak with him.

10:35.589 --> 10:37.756
He may surprise you.

10:39.325 --> 10:41.461
And I sense a sadness,

10:41.462 --> 10:43.663
a terrible loneliness.

10:43.664 --> 10:45.164
Oh, that's probably just me.

10:45.165 --> 10:47.100
No, you are childless.

10:47.101 --> 10:48.868
Yeah, okay. I'm aware.

10:48.869 --> 10:51.804
This person has a family, friends,

10:51.805 --> 10:54.240
and yet they feel alone.

10:54.241 --> 10:56.376
What, me?

10:56.377 --> 10:58.511
(CHUCKLES): Oh, I am not lonely.

10:58.512 --> 11:00.513
Your love will return to you.

11:00.514 --> 11:02.248
I just said that I'm not...

11:02.249 --> 11:03.950
Wait, wait. Which love?

11:03.951 --> 11:05.618
I mean, 'cause there's been a couple.

11:05.619 --> 11:09.221
The one who will be a
father to your little girl.

11:11.391 --> 11:13.793
May I see the room
with the dishes now?

11:13.794 --> 11:17.163
I would like to take a selfie
with Grace Coolidge's portrait.

11:17.164 --> 11:19.265
Of course.

11:19.266 --> 11:22.168
So this love... can you describe him?

11:22.169 --> 11:25.271
So, I walk into
the briefing with Morejon,

11:25.272 --> 11:28.341
and the first thing I notice is:
there's no chair for me.

11:28.342 --> 11:30.009
I have to ask for one.

11:30.010 --> 11:32.078
(SCOFFS)

11:32.079 --> 11:34.013
Say what you like
about Carlos Morejon,

11:34.014 --> 11:36.816
- there is no one more petty.
- Right? Whatever.

11:36.817 --> 11:39.719
I'm-I'm happy to play along.
Haze me as much as you want.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.322
But when I tell you that
there's a terrorist threat

11:42.323 --> 11:44.123
against our troops in Afghanistan,

11:44.124 --> 11:46.392
and we need funds
to expose and end it,

11:46.393 --> 11:49.495
then stop playing games and join
the adults in the real world.

11:49.496 --> 11:51.597
Did you say that?

11:51.598 --> 11:54.834
Well, I was,
I was a little less combative,

11:54.835 --> 11:59.038
but you know, I-I lose my temper
with these bureaucrats.

11:59.039 --> 12:00.206

12:00.207 --> 12:02.342
As it turns out,
it's all for nothing, because

12:02.343 --> 12:04.677
not only will they not
release the funds to S.A.D.,

12:04.678 --> 12:07.180
but they're proposing
phased spending cuts

12:07.181 --> 12:08.715
over the next decade,

12:08.716 --> 12:10.817
which Morejon was more
than thrilled to tell me about.

12:10.818 --> 12:12.018

12:17.925 --> 12:19.525
so, you want to have breakfast?

12:19.526 --> 12:22.095
I'm actually gonna head back
first thing in the morning.

12:22.096 --> 12:23.314
Oh.

12:23.315 --> 12:25.531
I want to get back to
the dorm and see Lucinda.

12:25.532 --> 12:27.533
- We should talk.
- That's a good idea.

12:27.534 --> 12:29.569
Let me know how that goes, okay?

12:29.570 --> 12:31.537
Me, too.

12:31.538 --> 12:32.939
Your father forgot to fill me in,

12:32.940 --> 12:35.541
but he's gonna take care
of that right now.

Honey, are you okay?

13:20.687 --> 13:22.055
Yeah, but something's happened.

13:22.056 --> 13:23.589
- Wait. What's wrong?
- ALISON: I walked into

13:23.590 --> 13:25.124
the dorm, and Lucinda
was on the floor,

13:25.125 --> 13:27.126
- and I couldn't wake her up.

13:28.595 --> 13:30.296
Yeah, but,

there was an empty bottle
of pills and vodka on the floor.

There has to be a way
to thread this needle.

17:41.580 --> 17:43.349
Ma'am?

17:43.350 --> 17:44.917
We do have a suggestion,

17:44.918 --> 17:47.619
and it would require you
to be somewhat covert.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.121
What do you have in mind?

17:49.122 --> 17:51.222
Uh...

17:52.091 --> 17:53.625
We appreciate you coming in

17:53.626 --> 17:55.294
on such short notice, Mr. President.

17:55.295 --> 17:56.462
It is no problem.

17:56.463 --> 17:59.231
I'm sorry we could not come to terms.

17:59.232 --> 18:03.369
Well, it occurred to us that you,

18:03.370 --> 18:05.704
and consequently the spirits,

18:05.705 --> 18:07.906
didn't actually hear
the complete details

18:07.907 --> 18:11.076
of our agreement with Scott
Goodman the other day, and...

18:11.077 --> 18:13.846
And we're hoping that after
you get all that information,

18:13.847 --> 18:18.117
including a few new enticements,
you might change your mind.

18:18.118 --> 18:22.354
It is not my president's mind
that needs to be changed.

18:22.355 --> 18:25.424
It is the spirits who have spoken,

18:25.425 --> 18:29.128
and they are at one
with the universe and stars.

18:29.129 --> 18:31.263
I agree that money
is a transitory thing

18:31.264 --> 18:33.365
of no use to the dead,

18:33.366 --> 18:38.003
but can we perhaps
consider the idea that

18:38.004 --> 18:40.072
their <i>descendants</i> might like some?

18:40.073 --> 18:42.775
ELIZABETH: Scott Goodman would still

18:42.776 --> 18:45.878
upgrade the infrastructure of
the hard-line phone services,

18:45.879 --> 18:50.849
but we got him to agree to
use <i>only</i> local labor to do it.

18:50.850 --> 18:52.718
TERESA: Independent contractor
agreements

18:52.719 --> 18:55.187
will be drawn up
that are very generous

18:55.188 --> 18:57.656
to all the Sri Lankan
telecom companies.

18:57.657 --> 19:00.159
ELIZABETH: And that includes, uh,

19:00.160 --> 19:03.896
Jaffna Telecom, Mendis Telecom and...?

19:03.897 --> 19:05.630
- Dandu?
- Dandu.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.536
If only my grandmother
were not so stubborn.

19:13.272 --> 19:16.975
Your grandmother
is stubborn, Mr. President,

19:16.976 --> 19:19.912
but also a wise, kind woman.

19:19.913 --> 19:21.914
And let us all remember

19:21.915 --> 19:27.052
that new information often opens
exciting avenues of discovery.

19:27.053 --> 19:29.621
I must return to the hotel

19:29.622 --> 19:31.523
and meditate on this new development.

19:31.524 --> 19:35.194
I will ask Nuveena and the
spirit world for guidance.

19:35.195 --> 19:38.297
Of course. And why don't you take this

19:38.298 --> 19:41.800
adjusted report, just in case
the spirits need clarification?

19:41.801 --> 19:46.137
Yes, that is a good idea.

19:53.111 --> 19:54.880
ELIZABETH (LAUGHING): <i>And then,</i>

19:54.881 --> 19:57.616
at around 5:00, we got the call.

19:57.617 --> 19:58.984
- No.
- Oh, yes.

19:58.985 --> 20:00.352
(LAUGHS): Oh.

20:00.353 --> 20:02.427
Grandma Nuveena has blessed
the deal once more.

20:02.428 --> 20:04.556
Wow. Nicely done, babe.

20:04.557 --> 20:06.158
STEVIE: Wow.

20:06.159 --> 20:07.893
Noodle, you okay?

20:07.894 --> 20:10.295
I was going to text Lucinda,
but then I remembered

20:10.296 --> 20:12.331
she doesn't have her phone
in the hospital.

20:12.332 --> 20:16.635
I, uh... I reached out
to her mother, Alison,

20:16.636 --> 20:19.805
as a... just to check in.

20:19.806 --> 20:24.209
And she told us that Lucinda

20:24.210 --> 20:28.981
was treated for anxiety and
depression in high school.

20:28.982 --> 20:31.482
That her parents thought
she had it under control.

20:31.483 --> 20:34.885
She's been dealing with this
issue since before you ever met.

20:37.155 --> 20:39.457
I'm gonna go grab a sweater.

20:44.062 --> 20:46.231
- Can I, can I go play the...?
- Yeah. Just 20 minutes,

20:46.232 --> 20:47.633
- then homework.
- JASON: All right.

20:47.634 --> 20:49.902
(HENRY SIGHS)

20:49.903 --> 20:55.407
You remember my first
boyfriend at Lovell? Brody?

20:55.408 --> 20:57.109
Oh, yeah, he was a nice kid.

20:57.110 --> 20:58.810
Something like this happened to him.

20:58.811 --> 21:00.846
He seemed fine, and then...

21:00.847 --> 21:05.884
mid-terms sent him
into this kind of...

21:05.885 --> 21:07.853
an anxiety spiral.

21:07.854 --> 21:12.090
And he started, like,
drinking too much, and...

21:12.091 --> 21:13.191
driving too fast, and...

21:13.192 --> 21:14.660
I don't know. This one time,

21:14.661 --> 21:16.862
we were out together,
and I just... I...

21:16.863 --> 21:19.865
I got really scared.

21:19.866 --> 21:22.333
Um...

21:23.769 --> 21:25.904
I thought... I told you about this.

21:25.905 --> 21:29.608
I am 100% sure you never told us.

21:29.609 --> 21:31.777
- He was drunk driving?
- ELIZABETH: I'm surprised.

21:31.778 --> 21:34.446
- You just called him a nice kid.
- Okay.

21:34.447 --> 21:37.683
This is obviously why
I never told you.

21:37.684 --> 21:40.819
Anyway, he dropped out, and, um,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.055
he went to work for this NGO
that digs wells in Africa,

21:43.056 --> 21:45.657
and he's still in Malawi,

21:45.658 --> 21:47.426
and he's very happy from what I hear.

21:47.427 --> 21:49.795
- ALISON: Jason!
- Oh, God. What did he do?

21:49.796 --> 21:51.597
You broke my night-light!

21:51.598 --> 21:53.699
You used my room without my permission

21:53.700 --> 21:56.301
to make your stupid gym,
and you broke my night-light.

21:56.302 --> 21:57.603
No, I didn't.

21:57.604 --> 21:59.538
You moved every piece
of furniture in my room,

21:59.539 --> 22:01.673
- and now it's cracked.
- HENRY: Okay, here, let me...

22:01.674 --> 22:02.708
You backed a chair into it.

22:02.709 --> 22:04.309
Let me see. Maybe I can fix it.

22:04.310 --> 22:05.744
Or we can get another one.

22:05.745 --> 22:06.912
I don't want another one.

22:06.913 --> 22:08.213
I've had this one forever.

22:08.214 --> 22:09.348
You know,
it doesn't even work anymore.

22:09.349 --> 22:11.283
You don't care
about anyone but yourself.

22:11.284 --> 22:12.618
STEVIE: Jason, just say you're sorry.

22:12.619 --> 22:13.986
No, she's acting crazy.

22:13.987 --> 22:15.387
HENRY: Apologize to her.

22:15.388 --> 22:17.022
Fine, you know what? I'm-I'm sorry

22:17.023 --> 22:18.390
I broke your stupid night-light

22:18.391 --> 22:19.625
that hasn't worked
in, like, ten years.

22:19.626 --> 22:20.959
Oh, my God. Please forgive me.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.827
- I hate you!
- Hey! Hey.

22:23.695 --> 22:26.363
That's enough. That's enough. Stop.

22:27.766 --> 22:29.533
You are a moron, Jason.

22:33.728 --> 22:37.447
Well, she's calmed down, and I
think I can fix the night-light.

22:37.448 --> 22:39.882
You know it's not about
the night-light, right?

22:40.650 --> 22:42.786
Ali has had issues

22:42.787 --> 22:45.922
with anxiety at school.

22:45.923 --> 22:48.892
There was that project
she couldn't even get started.

22:48.893 --> 22:50.527
I read an article

22:50.528 --> 22:53.029
about these kids in California.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.631
They got stressed out,

22:54.632 --> 22:56.266
felt like they had nowhere to turn,

22:56.267 --> 22:57.667
and then one after the other,

22:57.668 --> 22:59.336
they...

22:59.337 --> 23:00.770
There's a term for it.

23:00.771 --> 23:02.172
S-Suicide clusters.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.141
Alison's upset about her friend,
but she doesn't seem suicidal.

23:05.142 --> 23:08.178
Alison didn't think
Lucinda was suicidal.

23:08.179 --> 23:11.046
Lucinda's parents didn't see it.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.484
We didn't see it with your dad.

23:19.656 --> 23:22.692
I don't know.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.662
Maybe I'm worrying too much.

23:25.663 --> 23:28.797
That's better
than not worrying enough.

23:39.943 --> 23:42.379
Hey, Noodle.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.813
What are you doing up?

23:43.814 --> 23:45.115
Bad dream.

23:45.116 --> 23:46.416
(SIGHS): Well,

23:46.417 --> 23:47.617
Mom's been looking for an excuse

23:47.618 --> 23:50.620
to make her famous
bacon banana pancakes, so...

23:50.621 --> 23:52.022
Thanks.

23:52.023 --> 23:53.523
But I gave up pork.

23:53.524 --> 23:54.924
Oh.

23:54.925 --> 23:57.193
Lucinda showed me
this documentary about pigs

23:57.194 --> 23:59.262
and how social they are.

23:59.263 --> 24:00.697
They're smarter than dogs.

24:00.698 --> 24:04.701
Well, she sounds like
a very thoughtful young woman.

24:04.702 --> 24:06.969
She is.

24:08.171 --> 24:10.439
And a good friend.

24:11.641 --> 24:14.344
How could I not see
that she was so unhappy?

24:14.345 --> 24:17.246
(SIGHS)

24:18.948 --> 24:22.885
Is that how it was for
you with Grandpa?

24:24.621 --> 24:27.023
Yeah.

24:27.024 --> 24:28.525
For months after,

24:28.526 --> 24:30.126
I would go over
conversations we'd had.

24:30.127 --> 24:32.295
I kept thinking
there was something I missed.

24:32.296 --> 24:36.066
Uh, a moment where I could have
broken through

24:36.067 --> 24:37.934
and changed his mind.

24:37.935 --> 24:41.538
And he never asked for
help about anything,

24:41.539 --> 24:43.473
but I still felt like I let him down.

24:43.474 --> 24:44.941
And what was hardest

24:44.942 --> 24:48.211
was that I was really angry at him

24:48.212 --> 24:52.115
because he never told me
what was going on.

24:52.116 --> 24:55.218
He never even gave me
a chance to stop him.

24:55.219 --> 24:56.686
Because if you would have known,

24:56.687 --> 24:58.254
you would have done anything, right?

24:58.255 --> 25:00.657
Yeah, just like you
would've done anything

25:00.658 --> 25:02.959
to help Lucinda.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.427
(ELIZABETH SIGHS)

25:04.428 --> 25:06.362
Look at you two snuggle-pies.

25:06.363 --> 25:08.098
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:08.099 --> 25:09.432
- Morning. Good morning.
- Hi. Mmm.

25:09.433 --> 25:12.736
You want me to make some breakfast?

25:12.737 --> 25:15.205
Yeah, but just nothing with bacon

25:15.206 --> 25:18.041
'cause, uh, Ali and I are
giving up pork, right?

25:18.042 --> 25:19.342
- (CHUCKLES)
- ELIZABETH: What?

25:19.343 --> 25:22.712
Pigs beat three-year-olds
on cognition tests.

25:22.713 --> 25:24.214
Did you know that?

25:24.215 --> 25:25.849
No, I didn't.

25:25.850 --> 25:28.118
Sort of sorry I do now.

25:28.119 --> 25:29.786
Okay.

25:29.787 --> 25:32.589
Oatmeal and berries and whatever.

25:32.590 --> 25:35.825
Um, I think I'm actually
gonna head out.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.293
ELIZABETH: So soon?

25:37.294 --> 25:39.562
I mean, if that's what you
want to do, that's okay,

25:39.563 --> 25:41.631
but are-are you sure
that's what you want to do?

25:41.632 --> 25:43.833
'Cause you could always stay
a little longer.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.100
It's an option.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.238
Yeah, I just want to get back.

25:48.239 --> 25:50.572
Okay.

25:58.281 --> 25:59.649
- (KNOCKS)
- Dr. McCord.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.918
Yeah? Two surface-to-air missiles

26:01.919 --> 26:03.419
were launched at a pair of Lakotas

26:03.420 --> 26:04.988
ferrying supplies to Logar province.

26:04.989 --> 26:07.991
- Did they hit the targets?
- One of them

26:07.992 --> 26:09.192
suffered rotor damage

26:09.193 --> 26:11.227
but was able to make it back
to base with no injuries.

26:11.228 --> 26:12.362
It was a close call.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.997
(SIGHS) Okay.

26:13.998 --> 26:15.098
Call Senator Morejon's office.

26:15.099 --> 26:16.432
Tell him we've had an escalation.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.334
I need to brief the Gang
of Eight as soon as possible.

26:18.335 --> 26:20.970
- Okay, you got it.
- Okay.

26:20.971 --> 26:23.306
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:23.307 --> 26:25.809
So, uh...

26:25.810 --> 26:28.077
you know, I was thinking about...

26:28.078 --> 26:29.846
what that psychic said.

26:29.847 --> 26:32.448
About you being sad and childless?

26:32.449 --> 26:33.583
Just childless.

26:33.584 --> 26:35.318
- Daisy was sad.
- Right.

26:35.319 --> 26:36.519
I was just wondering,

26:36.520 --> 26:38.688
that thing that Ranuga said
about your brother,

26:38.689 --> 26:40.857
um...

26:40.858 --> 26:42.926
- if it turned out to be true?
- Why?

26:42.927 --> 26:45.228
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

26:45.229 --> 26:46.296
Like, if he's right

26:46.297 --> 26:47.797
about my brother
calling and surprising me,

26:47.798 --> 26:49.866
you're gonna hop on the psychic train

26:49.867 --> 26:52.001
and start thinking he's right
about you, too?

26:52.002 --> 26:55.071
(LAUGHING): Or Daisy?

26:55.072 --> 26:58.140
Or you and-and, uh...

26:59.375 --> 27:01.244
You and Daisy?

27:01.245 --> 27:04.180
You're hoping
you're Daisy's lost love.

27:04.181 --> 27:05.748
JAY: Hey.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.116
We've got a problem.

27:07.117 --> 27:09.519
Oh, come on.
What do the spirits want now?

27:09.520 --> 27:10.720
A pony?

27:10.721 --> 27:12.088
It's not Ranuga. It's the Chinese.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.756
They heard our agreement was shaky,

27:13.757 --> 27:15.558
went back to Nandasiri,
and now they piggybacked

27:15.559 --> 27:17.360
a telecom agreement on it, too.

27:17.361 --> 27:20.463
So much for waiting
for Nandasiri to get to Ottawa.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.931
Chen must have called

27:21.932 --> 27:24.067
- and backed off fishing rights.
- JAY: Nope.

27:24.068 --> 27:26.001
Nandasiri just caved.

27:27.237 --> 27:30.406
Two months ago, that was a nonstarter.

27:30.407 --> 27:32.542
What changed his mind?

27:32.543 --> 27:33.576
If this deal falls through,

27:33.577 --> 27:34.844
then the Chinese will have bested us

27:34.845 --> 27:36.945
in the Indian Ocean.
We'll be out in the cold.

27:38.147 --> 27:39.582
Reach out to Ephraim Ware

27:39.583 --> 27:40.817
and put Intelligence on this.

27:40.818 --> 27:42.685
President Dalton

27:42.686 --> 27:44.120
is back in three weeks.

27:44.121 --> 27:47.290
I'll be damned if the Chinese
are gonna turn Hambantota

27:47.291 --> 27:49.792
into mini-Hong Kong on my watch.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.960
Yes, ma'am.

28:01.368 --> 28:02.969
Hey.

28:10.868 --> 28:13.137
I'm so glad you're
out of the hospital.

28:13.138 --> 28:15.940
Me, too. It sucks.

28:15.941 --> 28:16.908
What was I thinking?

28:16.909 --> 28:18.676
I mean, I know what I was thinking.

28:18.677 --> 28:20.044
My therapist says I need to stop

28:20.045 --> 28:23.681
"minimizing my suicidal ideation."

28:23.682 --> 28:26.184
I'm really sorry you
had to find me like that.

28:26.185 --> 28:28.453
I-I'm just glad I got there.

28:28.454 --> 28:32.255
Eh, in time.

28:33.424 --> 28:37.128
On the bright side, you'll be
the only freshman with a single.

28:37.129 --> 28:38.996
(CHUCKLES)

28:38.997 --> 28:40.465
But I'm gonna miss your sock puppets.

28:40.466 --> 28:44.000
- (LAUGHS)
- And you.

28:48.306 --> 28:51.008
Well... (CHUCKLES)

28:51.009 --> 28:53.211
I got to go.

28:53.212 --> 28:55.613
Take care.

28:55.614 --> 28:58.081
You, too.

29:08.826 --> 29:11.194
♪

29:33.384 --> 29:36.454
Hey.

29:36.455 --> 29:39.223
I thought for sure you'd be sleeping.

29:39.224 --> 29:40.758
I'm obsessing over

29:40.759 --> 29:42.760
what I'm gonna say to the
Gang of Eight tomorrow.

29:42.761 --> 29:46.631
Okay. Let's hear it.

29:46.632 --> 29:49.567
Don't you have enough with saving

29:49.568 --> 29:52.036
our Indian Ocean trade position...

29:52.037 --> 29:55.473
Trying not to obsess about Ali, so...

29:55.474 --> 29:57.708
So you just want a distraction.

29:57.709 --> 29:59.944
I don't know.

29:59.945 --> 30:03.581
Sometimes I think the whole
job is just a distraction

30:03.582 --> 30:05.750
from worrying about the kids.

30:05.751 --> 30:07.051
Is that weird?

30:07.052 --> 30:08.886
Mm... kind of.

30:08.887 --> 30:14.792
Anyhoo, distract me
with your eloquence.

30:14.793 --> 30:18.529
Okay. "Mr. Chairman,
as a taxpayer and a citizen,

30:18.530 --> 30:21.465
"I recognize this body provides
an essential check

30:21.466 --> 30:23.801
"on the overreach of executive power.

30:23.802 --> 30:26.871
It's an awesome responsibility..."

30:26.872 --> 30:29.106
All right, listen, it doesn't
matter what I say at this point.

30:29.107 --> 30:30.341
They're not gonna change their minds.

30:30.342 --> 30:31.375
I need to think outside the box.

30:31.376 --> 30:32.610
I need to come up with a move

30:32.611 --> 30:35.513
that they're not gonna see coming.

30:35.514 --> 30:37.548
You know what?

30:37.549 --> 30:39.850
I'm gonna call Ali
before it gets too late.

30:39.851 --> 30:42.987
I thought you said you
didn't want to obsess.

30:42.988 --> 30:45.623
Every time I think about her
alone in that dorm room,

30:45.624 --> 30:47.491
I just want to run and go get her.

30:47.492 --> 30:50.094
Babe, if she needs us, she will call.

30:50.095 --> 30:52.597
(PHONE VIBRATES)

30:52.598 --> 30:54.397
(LAUGHS)

30:58.903 --> 31:01.372
Oh, shoot. It's Ephraim Ware.

31:01.373 --> 31:02.839
Ha-ha.

31:06.410 --> 31:09.247
Mr. President, thank you
for meeting with me.

31:09.248 --> 31:11.482
Of course. Would you like some tea?

31:11.483 --> 31:13.950
No, thank you.

31:17.622 --> 31:20.391
If this is about the
agreement with the Chinese,

31:20.392 --> 31:23.261
their foreign minister made
an offer I couldn't refuse.

31:23.262 --> 31:24.362
(CHUCKLES)

31:24.363 --> 31:27.765
Minister Chen is very... persuasive.

31:27.766 --> 31:30.234
How else to explain

31:30.235 --> 31:33.271
why you gave them unfettered
fishing rights,

31:33.272 --> 31:36.274
so your people will have to
compete with foreign vessels

31:36.275 --> 31:37.541
in their own waters?

31:37.542 --> 31:39.143
In exchange, the Chinese promise

31:39.144 --> 31:41.145
preferential tea market access.

31:41.146 --> 31:44.015
Tea manufactured at
a Chinese shell company

31:44.016 --> 31:47.818
built in Sri Lanka, with
20% of the profits going

31:47.819 --> 31:51.689
directly to an offshore
account in your name.

31:51.690 --> 31:54.591
Minister Chen offered you a bribe.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.828
How dare you accuse me.

32:02.933 --> 32:06.103
You're in a financial free fall.

32:06.104 --> 32:08.639
Due in large part to you

32:08.640 --> 32:13.144
and your wife's spending habits.

32:13.145 --> 32:17.248
But you cannot trade your
country's sovereignty

32:17.249 --> 32:22.119
in exchange for a personal
bailout from the Chinese.

32:22.120 --> 32:26.357
We negotiated a fair deal,
Mr. President.

32:26.358 --> 32:28.592
One that benefited both our countries.

32:28.593 --> 32:31.929
One that was blessed by Nuveena.

32:31.930 --> 32:35.099
And the business with the
Chinese, that's gonna come out,

32:35.100 --> 32:39.704
and there is nothing either
of us can do to stop it, so...

32:39.705 --> 32:44.342
What if I walk away from the Chinese?

32:44.343 --> 32:49.380
Can't we put this horrible
misunderstanding behind us?

32:49.381 --> 32:52.350
You consult with the spirits.

32:52.351 --> 32:55.752
I'll talk to the acting president.

33:01.738 --> 33:05.053
You settling back in all right?
You need anything?

33:05.054 --> 33:06.922
You're gonna laugh.

33:06.923 --> 33:08.156
Try me.

33:08.157 --> 33:11.326
Lucinda's mom accidentally
took the wet/dry hand vac.

33:11.327 --> 33:13.462
(CHUCKLES)

33:13.463 --> 33:15.797
Well, I'll tell you what,
you can take my upstairs one

33:15.798 --> 33:17.499
when you come home.

33:17.500 --> 33:21.503
When's that gonna be, by the way?

33:21.504 --> 33:22.971
I don't know.

33:22.972 --> 33:26.508
Ma'am. Acting President Hurst
is asking to see you.

33:26.509 --> 33:27.642
Let me call you back.

33:27.643 --> 33:29.411
I'm just about to walk into class.

33:29.412 --> 33:32.414
You call me tonight, okay, baby?

33:32.415 --> 33:33.682
You promise?

33:33.683 --> 33:34.683
Yeah, I promise.

33:34.684 --> 33:37.885
I love you.

33:58.473 --> 34:00.742
I can't tell you how many times

34:00.743 --> 34:04.713
I've come into this office and
seen Conrad on that very spot,

34:04.714 --> 34:07.082
working out a problem.

34:07.083 --> 34:09.550
It's a good spot.

34:11.753 --> 34:15.190
I wanted to thank you personally

34:15.190 --> 34:18.760
- for saving the Sri Lankan deal.
- Oh.

34:18.761 --> 34:21.029
And let you know that we won't

34:21.030 --> 34:23.465
be going forward with it after all.

34:23.466 --> 34:26.333
- Why not?
- There's been too much dishonesty

34:26.335 --> 34:28.737
from Nandasiri... too much
double-dealing on their part,

34:28.737 --> 34:29.871
too much compromise on ours.

34:29.871 --> 34:32.373
But if we walk,

34:32.375 --> 34:35.018
- Sri Lanka will close with China.
- I know.

34:35.020 --> 34:36.545
But I can't sign my name to this

34:36.545 --> 34:38.679
if I don't believe
they'll hold up their end.

34:38.681 --> 34:42.617
So, let me build guarantees
into the agreement

34:42.618 --> 34:44.119
that will keep Nandasiri in line.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.219
Elizabeth...

34:48.456 --> 34:49.858
When we were in Russia,

34:49.859 --> 34:52.293
you advised me to walk
away from Salnikov

34:52.295 --> 34:56.264
because it was not
good for our country.

34:56.264 --> 34:59.334
You were right, then.

34:59.335 --> 35:01.369
I'm right, now.

35:01.370 --> 35:04.739
This deal is not good for our country,

35:04.740 --> 35:08.208
and as acting president,
that is my decision to make.

35:14.449 --> 35:16.383
Thank you, ma'am.

35:19.336 --> 35:21.672
JAY: <i>I'm just gonna say it:
Teresa Hurst spiked this deal</i>

35:21.673 --> 35:23.740
to flip off Dalton because
he won't back her

35:23.741 --> 35:25.829
- in the next election.
- No.

35:25.830 --> 35:27.686
She was genuinely for the deal

35:27.687 --> 35:30.089
until Nandasiri pulled a fast one.

35:30.090 --> 35:33.993
Her gut told her to
walk away... I respect that.

35:33.994 --> 35:35.728
Either way, we still
failed to hold the line

35:35.729 --> 35:36.729
in the Indian Ocean.

35:36.730 --> 35:40.265
Not necessarily.

35:41.467 --> 35:43.369
How's it going with our bilateral

35:43.370 --> 35:44.570
trade agreement with Indonesia?

35:44.571 --> 35:46.438
KAT: Fewer overinvested

35:46.439 --> 35:47.806
grandma ghosts than Sri Lanka.

35:47.807 --> 35:51.877
- We are almost closed.
- Right. Reach out.

35:51.878 --> 35:56.482
See if they're interested in
upgrading their telecom systems.

35:56.483 --> 36:01.120
In exchange for better access to
deepwater ports off Jakarta?

36:01.121 --> 36:03.589
- We're on it.
- (CHUCKLES): Yes, ma'am.

36:03.590 --> 36:08.092
Um, Madam Secretary, could I
ask you a personal question?

36:09.461 --> 36:10.763
- Fire away.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

36:10.764 --> 36:12.464
- Ma'am. Sorry.
- Yeah.

36:12.465 --> 36:13.933
Rangua called and left a word for you.

36:13.934 --> 36:17.469
Ranuga? Okay, let's get him back.

36:17.470 --> 36:20.940
No, I was being literal.
He left "a word" for you.

36:20.941 --> 36:23.876
(SCOFFS)

36:23.877 --> 36:25.077
You were saying?

36:25.078 --> 36:26.679
I was just wondering if
you were thinking that,

36:26.680 --> 36:29.314
when the time came, you might run.

36:33.586 --> 36:34.887
FLETCHER: Compelling remarks,

36:34.888 --> 36:37.856
and I understand
your concern, Dr. McCord,

36:37.857 --> 36:42.361
but you're saying
no service members were hurt

36:42.362 --> 36:44.663
- during the attack.
- That's correct.

36:44.664 --> 36:46.966
And drones in the area took them out,

36:46.967 --> 36:50.469
along with at least three
members of the splinter group.

36:50.470 --> 36:51.904
So what's the issue?

36:51.905 --> 36:54.240
The issue is the safety
of American troops

36:54.241 --> 36:56.141
as we move towards a full drawdown,

36:56.142 --> 36:59.921
and the possibility that these rogue
elements will be emboldened by...

36:59.922 --> 37:01.480
Isn't this a problem for
the Afghan army now?

37:01.481 --> 37:05.117
But we need to work with them
if we want it done properly.

37:05.118 --> 37:06.852
CARLOS: Frankly, I-I
think that this incident

37:06.853 --> 37:09.687
speaks to much larger
concerns in your department.

37:11.223 --> 37:13.592
Dr. McCord, I don't think
President Dalton

37:13.593 --> 37:17.129
made a wise decision when he
put you in charge of S.A.D.

37:17.130 --> 37:19.897
I think your long friendship
has colored his objectivity.

37:26.138 --> 37:28.374
(SCOFFS)

37:28.375 --> 37:32.611
President Dalton asked me
to do this job, and I accepted

37:32.612 --> 37:35.481
because we both thought that
I would be good at it.

37:35.482 --> 37:38.684
But I cannot do the work I was
hired to do without partners

37:38.685 --> 37:40.519
in congress who will back it up.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.822
Dr. McCord, I think we're done.

37:43.823 --> 37:45.390
We're done when I say we're done.

37:52.498 --> 37:54.800
I'm going to resign

37:54.801 --> 37:57.736
as the director of
Special Activities Division,

37:57.737 --> 37:59.638
and I just hope that my successor

37:59.639 --> 38:01.240
is more to your liking,

38:01.241 --> 38:04.176
and receives the funds and
the freedom to do the job right

38:04.177 --> 38:07.646
because what's at stake is
the lives of American soldiers,

38:07.647 --> 38:11.949
and a peaceful future for
the people of Afghanistan.

38:14.486 --> 38:15.621
Now we're done.

38:15.622 --> 38:18.924
- LEE: (SCOFFS)
- You...

38:18.925 --> 38:20.492
Your loss, Sri Lanka.

38:20.493 --> 38:22.194
- Secret file. Yep.
- Secret file.

38:22.195 --> 38:24.563
Ah, enjoy your continuation

38:24.564 --> 38:27.665
of slow downloads and dropped calls.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.235
(DRINK POURING)

38:30.236 --> 38:32.571
- What's going on here?
- JAY: We're saying farewell

38:32.572 --> 38:35.741
to the Sri Lanka deal...
10 months of negotiations.

38:35.742 --> 38:38.243
You just got here, so
you don't feel our pain.

38:38.244 --> 38:41.080
Yeah, but I can empathize
like nobody's business. Hit me.

38:41.081 --> 38:44.717
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh, guess who called.

38:44.718 --> 38:45.684
My brother.

38:45.685 --> 38:47.853
Aren't you back to ignoring him again?

38:47.854 --> 38:50.322
- I am, but he left a message.
- And?

38:50.323 --> 38:53.058
Uh, Logan's been stuck in a bad
marriage for almost ten years.

38:53.059 --> 38:56.627
They finally decided
to separate. Surprise.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.932
Oh no, don't look at me like that.

38:59.933 --> 39:02.568
I still think Ranuga's
a scammer. And you?

39:02.569 --> 39:05.037
Don't go acting like
this means anything.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.905
If you really want something
in this world,

39:06.906 --> 39:09.174
you got to just own it.

39:09.175 --> 39:11.977
Who cares what the spirits say?

39:11.978 --> 39:14.413
- Yes, ma'am.
- Besides,

39:14.414 --> 39:16.682
if anything's worth a risk
in this life,

39:16.683 --> 39:18.450
it's a second chance at love.

39:18.451 --> 39:21.018
Thank you for the drink.

39:23.555 --> 39:25.691
What did she mean by
a second chance at...?

39:25.692 --> 39:28.827
Oh, come on. Daisy? Again?

39:28.828 --> 39:31.864
What happened to, "it's all
pseudo-mystical nonsense"?

39:31.865 --> 39:33.932
What if I'm wrong?

39:33.933 --> 39:37.603
When have I ever been
right about anything?

39:37.604 --> 39:39.737
Maybe we're meant to be, man.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.541
Can I ask you a question?

39:42.542 --> 39:45.009
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you in love with her?

39:46.478 --> 39:48.580
'Cause if you are, then go for it.

39:48.581 --> 39:50.349
But if this is really
just you being afraid

39:50.350 --> 39:53.085
of spending the rest
of your life alone,

39:53.086 --> 39:55.053
Daisy and Joanna deserve better

39:55.054 --> 39:57.588
than just being your
ready-made family.

39:58.690 --> 39:59.792
DAISY: Hey.

39:59.793 --> 40:01.326
I'm about to update the gaggle.

40:01.327 --> 40:02.661
Any changes to the
secretary's statement

40:02.662 --> 40:03.829
on the Sri Lankan deal?

40:03.830 --> 40:05.130
JAY: Just keep it simple.

40:05.131 --> 40:06.698
"We're sorry the agreement
couldn't come together.

40:06.699 --> 40:08.667
Sri Lanka is a wonderful country
with a very generous people."

40:08.668 --> 40:10.736
That's what I got.

40:10.737 --> 40:12.404
What?

40:12.405 --> 40:13.806
Do I have something on my face?

40:13.807 --> 40:16.108
No, no. I was just, um...

40:16.109 --> 40:20.711
- Daisy, Oliver Shaw on the phone for you.
- Thanks.

40:25.150 --> 40:27.085
At first, I thought he meant run,

40:27.086 --> 40:28.420
as in run for president.

40:28.421 --> 40:30.289
And then I realized, no,
that's not it at all.

40:30.290 --> 40:32.191
Then what does it mean? I think

40:32.192 --> 40:34.893
that Alison is more unhappy
than she's letting on.

40:34.894 --> 40:37.062
I can feel it, Henry.

40:37.063 --> 40:39.431
And you can call it projection
if you want,

40:39.432 --> 40:42.768
but I think it's mother's intuition.

40:42.769 --> 40:45.003
Father's intuition, too. I've
been thinking about her all day.

40:45.004 --> 40:47.973
Then let's run and get our daughter.

40:47.974 --> 40:50.742
Oh, come on, Noodle. Pick up.

40:50.743 --> 40:52.256
HENRY: She's still not
answering the phone?

40:52.257 --> 40:54.713
No. I just spoke with her RA.

40:54.714 --> 40:56.381
She hasn't seen her since breakfast.

40:56.382 --> 40:57.749
She missed her afternoon classes.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.351
- Okay.
- I am officially worried.

40:59.352 --> 41:00.953
They know I've been calling her.
She's not picking up.

41:00.954 --> 41:03.522
Well, it's either call her again
or call the cops at this point.

41:03.523 --> 41:04.690
Okay, okay, okay.

41:04.691 --> 41:08.360
Wha... uh, Noodle?

41:08.361 --> 41:09.528
Uh, where are you?

41:09.529 --> 41:10.863
Home. Where are you guys?

41:10.864 --> 41:13.131
- (MOUTHS)
- What?

41:13.132 --> 41:15.366
We're-we're, um, at a restaurant.

41:17.469 --> 41:19.070
Is everything okay? Um...

41:20.772 --> 41:23.141
Not totally, actually.

41:23.142 --> 41:25.344
I was trying to pretend like
everything was okay, but...

41:25.345 --> 41:29.314
Hang on, I'll put you on speaker
so Mom can hear, too.

41:29.315 --> 41:30.716
Hey, baby.

41:30.717 --> 41:33.185
I was just saying that I kind of
started to feel overwhelmed,

41:33.186 --> 41:35.354
so I went to the admin's office,
and they said

41:35.355 --> 41:36.889
that I could finish

41:36.890 --> 41:40.325
two of my classes online
and commute for the other two.

41:40.326 --> 41:42.361
So, I was gonna ask if maybe I could

41:42.362 --> 41:43.495
live at home for a little while?

41:43.496 --> 41:44.696
ELIZABETH: Yes!

41:44.697 --> 41:46.765
- Of course. Yes.
- You know, whatever.

41:46.766 --> 41:48.667
Great. When are you guys
gonna be home?

41:48.668 --> 41:51.069
(STAMMERING) An hour?

41:51.070 --> 41:54.239
An hour? That's pretty far for dinner.

41:54.240 --> 41:57.743
Well the... the-the place
had really good reviews.

41:57.744 --> 41:59.645
- Sorry, can I speak to... Thank you.
- Yeah.

41:59.646 --> 42:02.814
Hey, uh, do you guys think
I could sign up for, like,

42:02.815 --> 42:03.949
the YMCA gym for,

42:03.950 --> 42:05.584
like, 15 bucks a month?

42:05.585 --> 42:07.719
- I promise I'll go.
- STEVIE (LAUGHS): Wow.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.987
'Cause you have all that free time

42:08.988 --> 42:10.355
since Ali broke your game controller?

42:10.356 --> 42:11.790
Yeah. I want a new one by the way.

42:11.791 --> 42:13.992
ALISON: Oh, yeah. Right after
you replace my night-light.

42:13.993 --> 42:16.228
- Hey, would...
- JASON: Okay, I got to go. Bye.

42:16.229 --> 42:19.164
Well, once again,
our soon-to-be empty nest is,

42:19.165 --> 42:22.401
ironically, at full capacity. (SIGHS)

42:22.402 --> 42:23.669
Just the way I like it.

42:23.670 --> 42:27.439
Big, noisy house filled
with the people I love.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.408
HENRY: I like that, too.

42:32.144 --> 42:33.345
HENRY: Okay.

42:33.346 --> 42:34.578
ELIZABETH: Okay.
