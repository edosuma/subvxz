00:12.291 --> 00:15.667
I know breakfast is the most

00:12.291 --> 00:15.667
important meal of the day,

00:15.709 --> 00:17.959
but does it have

00:15.709 --> 00:17.959
to come so early?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
But if it came later,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
it would be lunch.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.917
Graham,

00:20.542 --> 00:22.917
it's not rocket science.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.959
Actually, cooking is science.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.041
It deals with chemistry,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.041

00:27.083 --> 00:28.417
Changing the channel.

00:28.458 --> 00:30.250
Yeah, check out

00:28.458 --> 00:30.250
the Burnt Toast Network.

00:30.291 --> 00:33.166
( bell dings )

00:30.291 --> 00:33.166
I like it well done.

00:33.208 --> 00:36.500
Oops.

00:33.208 --> 00:36.500
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:36.542 --> 00:38.792
( sighs ):

00:36.542 --> 00:38.792
8:00, Cody.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.750
Wouldn't be a bad idea to leave

00:38.834 --> 00:41.750
for school a little early.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.208
It'll be hectic

00:41.792 --> 00:43.208
this morning

00:43.250 --> 00:45.083
with the new clock tower

00:43.250 --> 00:45.083
dedication.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.959
Sure thing, Dad.

(  soft dramatic theme playing  )

CODY:

00:51.667 --> 00:52.959
Morning, guys.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.750
Hey, Cody.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.750
What's that you have?

00:55.792 --> 00:58.834
A pocket watch. It was in

00:55.792 --> 00:58.834
the lost and found for a while,

00:58.875 --> 01:00.208
so Deputy Barney

00:58.875 --> 01:00.208
let me have it.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.041
But what if the actual owner

01:02.083 --> 01:04.500
comes looking for his or her

01:02.083 --> 01:04.500
misplaced bauble?

01:04.542 --> 01:06.208
Then I'll give it back.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.041
It looks so old.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.709
Definitely low-tech.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.375
That's what I like

01:09.750 --> 01:11.375
about it.

01:11.417 --> 01:14.583
It reminds me of the past,

01:11.417 --> 01:14.583
when things were simpler.

01:14.625 --> 01:17.250
Cody's right. Technology

01:14.625 --> 01:17.250
is great when it can help,

01:17.291 --> 01:20.000
but sometimes it starts

01:17.291 --> 01:20.000
controlling us.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.917
We're headed down

01:20.041 --> 01:21.917
to the dedication,

01:21.959 --> 01:23.667
so how about a ride

01:21.959 --> 01:23.667
to school, son?

01:23.709 --> 01:25.583
Feels like we haven't

01:23.709 --> 01:25.583
talked in ages.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.625
No, thanks, Dad.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.625
I want to walk.

01:27.667 --> 01:31.458
Hm. Used to be you'd want

01:27.667 --> 01:31.458
a ride with me every morning.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.208
You kids grow up

01:31.500 --> 01:33.208
too fast.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.458
Sometimes I wish

01:33.250 --> 01:35.458
I could go back in time

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500
and keep you little

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500
forever.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.500

Morning, class. We'll be taking

04:10.917 --> 04:14.709
a field trip today

It'll sync up every time-telling

04:35.166 --> 04:37.875
device in Griffin Rock.

04:37.917 --> 04:41.542
Not this one.

Good morning,

friends and citizens.

05:05.417 --> 05:07.959
Yeah--

05:05.417 --> 05:07.959
But our town's timepiece,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.417
now with state-of-the-art

05:08.000 --> 05:10.417
technology,

civic events:

06:22.375 --> 06:26.542
a few well-placed detour signs

06:22.375 --> 06:26.542
could prevent much trouble.

06:26.583 --> 06:29.417
My dedication is ruined!

No one was hurt, and probably

so early?

Wa... Was I...dreaming?

07:04.917 --> 07:07.333
Graham,

07:04.917 --> 07:07.333
it is not rocket science.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.417
Actually, cooking is science.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.709

07:23.583 --> 07:26.000
for school a little early.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.375
It'll be--

07:26.041 --> 07:27.375
Hectic.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.417
Because of the new

07:27.417 --> 07:29.417
clock tower dedication.

07:29.458 --> 07:33.208
Oh, you read my mind. Guess you

07:29.458 --> 07:33.208
know me pretty well, huh, son?

Everything okay?

I'm not sure.

How can it be 8:00 again?

07:43.709 --> 07:45.291
Hey, Cody--

07:45.333 --> 07:46.917
It's my pocket watch, Boulder.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.375
I got it from Deputy Barney.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.667
I was just going

07:48.417 --> 07:51.667
to ask that.

07:51.709 --> 07:54.625
I know.

07:51.709 --> 07:54.625
Something weird is happening.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.625
I've experienced

07:54.667 --> 07:56.625
all this before.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.792
In a few seconds,

07:56.667 --> 07:58.792
my family will come down,

07:58.834 --> 08:01.583
and my dad will ask me

07:58.834 --> 08:01.583
if I need a ride.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.583
Cody,

No, thanks, Dad.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.041
I'll walk.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.500
You kids grow up so fast.

08:08.542 --> 08:12.542
BOTH ( in unison ):

08:08.542 --> 08:12.542
If only I could go back in time

08:08.542 --> 08:12.542
and keep you little forever.

08:13.208 --> 08:17.250
Dad, I think I just did

08:13.208 --> 08:17.250
go back in time.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.375
CHASE:

08:20.333 --> 08:22.375
Back in time?

08:22.417 --> 08:24.250
What exactly do you mean, Cody?

08:24.291 --> 08:25.875
You came from the future?

08:25.917 --> 08:29.083
No. Well, sort of. It's just--

08:29.125 --> 08:30.750
I've been through

08:29.125 --> 08:30.750
all of this before.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.792
You mean like

08:30.792 --> 08:32.792
déjà vu?

08:32.834 --> 08:34.500
Déjà who?

08:34.542 --> 08:36.959
Déjà vu.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.959
It's a French term.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.458
It means "already seen."

08:38.500 --> 08:40.083
When you feel like

08:38.500 --> 08:40.083
something's happening

08:40.125 --> 08:41.875
that you already

08:40.125 --> 08:41.875
lived through before,

08:41.917 --> 08:44.792
it's called déjà vu.

08:41.917 --> 08:44.792
Oh, I get it.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.291
No, I don't.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.875
KADE:

08:46.333 --> 08:47.875
Oh, like arguing with Heatwave.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.542
Seems like that happens

08:47.917 --> 08:49.542
over and over.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.375
Unfortunately, that's real.

08:51.417 --> 08:54.250
It's not just a feeling,

08:51.417 --> 08:54.250
it's real events.

08:54.291 --> 08:57.709
Like toast burning,

08:54.291 --> 08:57.709
coffee spilling...

08:57.750 --> 09:00.417
Even Dad telling me he wants

08:57.750 --> 09:00.417
to keep me little forever.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.875
Ha-ha. Okay, if you've been

09:00.458 --> 09:03.875
through all this before,

09:03.917 --> 09:06.041
what are tonight's winning

09:03.917 --> 09:06.041
Lotsabucks numbers?

09:06.083 --> 09:08.041
I don't know.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.041
It was only this morning,

09:08.083 --> 09:09.834
just the last hour or so.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.500
Well, next time

09:09.875 --> 09:11.500
you time travel,

09:11.542 --> 09:13.625
get some useful

09:11.542 --> 09:13.625
information, huh, bro?

09:13.667 --> 09:15.375
Actual time-travel

09:13.667 --> 09:15.375
would have required

09:15.417 --> 09:17.166
some type of machine

09:15.417 --> 09:17.166
or portal.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.208
And there's nothing like that

09:17.208 --> 09:19.208
in this situation.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.250
You believe me, don't you, Dad?

09:21.291 --> 09:23.750
I believe you feel like

09:21.291 --> 09:23.750
you've been through all this.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.166
If you're worried, Cody,

09:25.208 --> 09:27.417
I think we should go talk

09:25.208 --> 09:27.417
to Doc Greene.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.083
That's okay. I think

09:27.458 --> 09:30.083
it's all over now anyway.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.709
All this seems new.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.542
Dani's right, it was probably

09:31.750 --> 09:34.542
just déjà vu.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.375
Or maybe even a dream.

09:36.417 --> 09:39.333
Well, we'll keep an eye on it.

09:36.417 --> 09:39.333
Thanks, Dad.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.041
HEATWAVE:

09:39.375 --> 09:42.041
Cody, maybe you didn't

09:39.375 --> 09:42.041
really time travel,

09:42.083 --> 09:44.041
but just to be on the safe side,

09:44.083 --> 09:45.417
is there anything

09:44.083 --> 09:45.417
we should know

09:45.458 --> 09:47.125
that might help

09:45.458 --> 09:47.125
in the next hour?

09:47.166 --> 09:50.125
After all, all tools are helpful

09:47.166 --> 09:50.125
in keeping the town safe,

09:50.166 --> 09:52.583
even unproven psychic phenomena.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.166
Thanks for believing me, guys.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.583
Well, maybe you should

09:54.208 --> 09:56.583
just come with me.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.125
(  light dramatic theme

09:56.625 --> 09:59.125
playing  )

09:59.166 --> 10:01.291
( cat growls )

10:01.333 --> 10:03.834
( squirrel chattering )

10:06.792 --> 10:08.542
Hey, Cody!

10:06.792 --> 10:08.542
What's going on?

10:08.583 --> 10:10.208
Just a little

10:08.583 --> 10:10.208
preventive maintenance.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.542
Hang on to him, Chase.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.542
Until Mr. Harrison flies by.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.417
He is flying pretty low,

10:18.458 --> 10:20.625
just like Cody said he would.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.458
Yeah, weird.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.208
( sighs )

10:25.250 --> 10:26.709
I guess everything's okay.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.000
Stopping Mr. Pettypaws

10:26.750 --> 10:29.000
seemed to take care of it.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.000
( meows and purrs )

10:31.041 --> 10:32.792
Cody, anything else

10:31.041 --> 10:32.792
we should know?

10:32.834 --> 10:36.000
Later, at the clock dedication,

10:32.834 --> 10:36.000
a toolbox is going to fall,

10:36.041 --> 10:38.208
and a fire hydrant

10:36.041 --> 10:38.208
is going to blow.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.917
We'll make sure they don't.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.333
Uh, you want to tell me

10:42.875 --> 10:45.333
what's going on?

10:45.375 --> 10:47.750
Um, later.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.750
After Timmy's books.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.417
And the pop quiz.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.208
Pop quiz?

10:51.250 --> 10:52.959
(  light dramatic theme

10:51.250 --> 10:52.959
playing  )

10:53.000 --> 10:55.041
( school bell rings )

10:53.000 --> 10:55.041
Hey, Timmy! Watch out!

10:55.083 --> 10:57.041
Don't turn that corner.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.041
You're going to--

10:57.083 --> 10:58.750
( Timmy grunts )

10:58.792 --> 11:00.041
Never mind.

11:02.166 --> 11:06.041
Morning, class. We'll be taking

11:02.166 --> 11:06.041
a field trip today

11:06.083 --> 11:08.834
to see the dedication

11:06.083 --> 11:08.834
of the clock tower.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.333
( all cheering )

11:11.375 --> 11:14.417
But first, a pop quiz.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.959
( all groan )

11:14.458 --> 11:15.959
BOY: Aw, man.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.834
How do you know

11:16.000 --> 11:17.834
all this stuff?

11:17.875 --> 11:21.792
I've already been through this

11:17.875 --> 11:21.792
whole morning before.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.333
I think I...

11:23.375 --> 11:25.250
traveled back in time.

11:25.291 --> 11:28.250
( gasps ):

11:25.291 --> 11:28.250
That is so cool.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.875
We have to tell my Dad.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.750
You actually believe me?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.083
Hello.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.083
We live in Griffin Rock.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.583
Let's finish the quiz,

11:34.125 --> 11:36.583
then ask Mr. Schulte

11:36.625 --> 11:37.959
if we can go see my Dad.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.166
After all, it is

11:38.000 --> 11:40.166
a matter of town safety.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.750
Or it could be.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.041
(  mysterious theme playing  )

11:51.750 --> 11:54.959
Note to self,

11:51.750 --> 11:54.959
do not add red algae puree.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.208
Try green kelp paste instead.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.208
FRANKIE: Hi, Dad!

11:58.250 --> 12:01.417
Hello, you two. I'm testing

11:58.250 --> 12:01.417
a new energy drink.

12:01.458 --> 12:04.250
Uh, shouldn't you be

12:01.458 --> 12:04.250
in school?

12:04.291 --> 12:05.625
We have an emergency.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.792
Cody's experiencing the same

12:05.667 --> 12:08.792
morning all over again.

12:08.834 --> 12:11.041
We need to help him figure out

12:08.834 --> 12:11.041
what's going on.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.291
Fascinating.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.291
Tell me everything, Cody.

12:14.333 --> 12:19.125
( echoes ):

12:14.333 --> 12:19.125
Well, it started at breakfast...

12:19.166 --> 12:21.542
Then Mrs. Rubio's car

12:19.166 --> 12:21.542
ran into the clock tower.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.125
And that's when

12:21.583 --> 12:23.125
I was sent back

12:23.166 --> 12:24.667
to the beginning

12:23.166 --> 12:24.667
of the morning.

12:24.709 --> 12:29.417
You seem to be experiencing

12:24.709 --> 12:29.417
a random distortion

12:29.458 --> 12:30.959
in the temporal continuum.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.917
Perhaps caused by

12:31.000 --> 12:33.917
a nucleo-electric anomaly.

12:33.959 --> 12:36.667
You're traveling

12:33.959 --> 12:36.667
back in time.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.250
That's what I thought.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.250
But how?

12:39.291 --> 12:41.041
And why only me?

12:41.083 --> 12:44.083
Could it have something to do

12:41.083 --> 12:44.083
with the clock tower being hit?

12:44.125 --> 12:47.417
It does run

12:44.125 --> 12:47.417
on magno-fusion technology.

12:47.458 --> 12:49.458
Precisely what I was thinking.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.750
But Cody's right,

12:49.500 --> 12:51.750
we have to figure out

12:51.792 --> 12:53.875
why this time jump

12:51.792 --> 12:53.875
is happening only to him

12:53.917 --> 12:55.667
and not to the rest of us.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.875
Because I don't remember having

12:55.709 --> 12:58.875
this conversation before.

12:58.917 --> 13:02.125
Uh, or did I? Hm.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.375
Um, not with me.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.542
Well, we better head down

13:04.417 --> 13:07.542
to the clock tower dedication

13:07.583 --> 13:08.959
and warn the Rescue Team.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.083
If we can prevent the car

13:09.000 --> 13:11.083
from hitting the tower

13:11.125 --> 13:15.417
and damaging the magno-fusion

13:11.125 --> 13:15.417
battery, Cody should be safe.

13:21.709 --> 13:24.709
Fire hydrant is secure.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.667
Oh, thanks.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.667
Forgot about that.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.291
Just keeping you safe,

13:28.709 --> 13:31.291
citizen.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.792
Is there anything else

13:31.333 --> 13:33.792
we should be aware of, Cody?

13:33.834 --> 13:35.375
Keep an eye out

13:33.834 --> 13:35.375
for Mrs. Rubio.

13:35.417 --> 13:38.250
A detour sign or two

13:35.417 --> 13:38.250
may help.

13:38.291 --> 13:41.417
Excellent idea.

13:41.458 --> 13:45.417
Heh. Thanks, Mr. Schulte.

13:41.458 --> 13:45.417
We took care of everything.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.208
( squirrel chattering )

13:47.250 --> 13:50.291
Well, he's right on time.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.291
Wonder where he's going?

13:50.333 --> 13:52.709
MAYOR LUSKEY:

13:50.333 --> 13:52.709
Good morning, Griffin Rock.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.458
As the saying goes,

13:54.500 --> 13:55.875
even a broken clock--

13:55.917 --> 13:57.458
Is right twice a day.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.875
Heh. Eh, wha...? Huh?

14:01.291 --> 14:03.458
But our town's timepiece,

14:03.500 --> 14:05.709
now with state-of-the-art

14:03.500 --> 14:05.709
technology,

14:05.750 --> 14:10.792
continuously tells perfect time

14:05.750 --> 14:10.792
down to the millisecond.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.959
I see Mrs. Rubio.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.959
She's headed this way.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.709
HEATWAVE:

14:13.000 --> 14:15.709
Should be fine,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.709
but track her just in case.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.417
...to our already

14:15.750 --> 14:18.417
thriving town,

14:18.458 --> 14:21.500
the Mayor Luskey Clock Tower!

14:21.542 --> 14:23.792
( crowd cheering )

14:26.375 --> 14:29.875
No sign of trouble.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.875
She's passing the crowd.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.875
( chattering )

14:32.917 --> 14:34.375
( squirrel squeaks )

14:34.417 --> 14:36.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:39.375 --> 14:42.291
Are you unharmed?

14:42.333 --> 14:46.291
Please drive carefully

14:42.333 --> 14:46.291
and avoid crowds.

14:46.333 --> 14:49.041
HEATWAVE:

14:46.333 --> 14:49.041
Don't know how you did it,

14:46.333 --> 14:49.041
Code, but you saved the day.

14:49.083 --> 14:52.125
Thanks for helping, guys.

14:49.083 --> 14:52.125
And for trusting me.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.875
Well, looks like

14:52.166 --> 14:53.875
you're safe.

14:53.917 --> 14:56.458
This time, nothing happened

14:53.917 --> 14:56.458
to the clock tower.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.625
( bell chimes )

14:58.667 --> 15:01.166
(  mysterious theme playing  )

15:03.625 --> 15:04.834

15:04.875 --> 15:07.917
( ticking )

15:07.959 --> 15:09.875
( yawns ):

15:07.959 --> 15:09.875
I know breakfast

15:09.917 --> 15:12.250
is the most important meal

15:09.917 --> 15:12.250
of the day, but...

15:12.291 --> 15:14.458
DANI & CODY:

15:12.291 --> 15:14.458
Does it have to come

15:12.291 --> 15:14.458
so early?

15:14.500 --> 15:15.709
( sighs )

15:15.750 --> 15:17.709
Round three.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.709
(  light dramatic theme

15:18.917 --> 15:20.709
playing  )

15:23.500 --> 15:25.000
Dude, what are you doing?

15:25.041 --> 15:27.417
Making sure

15:25.041 --> 15:27.417
you don't burn toast.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.583
I am insulted by that.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.458
I put out fires,

15:29.625 --> 15:32.458
I don't start 'em.

15:34.375 --> 15:38.291
Uh, thanks, I was

15:34.375 --> 15:38.291
just about to grab that.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.291
Don't worry, Dad.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.291
I won't be late,

15:40.333 --> 15:42.625
I don't need a ride and,

15:40.333 --> 15:42.625
yes, I'm growing up fast.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.041
Whoa, I was just going to--

15:45.083 --> 15:48.125
I know. But, listen, we need

15:45.083 --> 15:48.125
to see Doc Greene right now,

15:48.166 --> 15:50.417
with a stop

15:48.166 --> 15:50.417
at Mrs. Neederlander's first.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.500
I'll explain on the way.

15:52.542 --> 15:53.959
(  light dramatic theme

15:52.542 --> 15:53.959
playing  )

15:54.000 --> 15:55.875
CODY:

15:54.000 --> 15:55.875
Don't add red algae puree.

15:55.917 --> 15:57.709
It'll make your energy drink

15:55.917 --> 15:57.709
bubble over.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.959
Use the green kelp paste

15:57.750 --> 15:59.959
instead.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.291
But how did you know I was--?

16:02.333 --> 16:04.375
Same way he knew about

16:02.333 --> 16:04.375
Mr. Pettypaws and Mr. Harrison.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.917
He's psycho.

16:05.959 --> 16:08.959
I think you mean "psychic."

16:05.959 --> 16:08.959
And he's not.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.959
Uh, seems like I've told this

16:09.000 --> 16:12.959
story a lot already, but...

16:13.000 --> 16:16.125
This morning I came out

16:13.000 --> 16:16.125
for breakfast...

16:16.166 --> 16:19.083
And that's when I went back

16:16.166 --> 16:19.083
for the second time.

16:19.125 --> 16:22.083
So the solution I suggested,

16:19.125 --> 16:22.083
uh, before,

16:22.125 --> 16:23.625
no longer makes sense.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.458
It must not be the car

16:23.667 --> 16:25.458
hitting the clock

16:25.500 --> 16:27.208
that's sending you back,

16:27.250 --> 16:30.291
but something else damaging

16:27.250 --> 16:30.291
the magno-fusion battery.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.417
Cody, do you remember anything

16:30.333 --> 16:33.417
else going on with the clock?

16:33.458 --> 16:37.083
No, but I couldn't really see

16:33.458 --> 16:37.083
everything from where I was.

16:37.125 --> 16:41.667
Well, whatever it is, it always

16:37.125 --> 16:41.667
happens precisely at 9 a.m.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.041
Doc said the battery casing

16:45.041 --> 16:47.041
should be somewhere

16:47.083 --> 16:48.542
on the observation deck.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.458
( groans )

16:51.500 --> 16:55.208
Aw, nothing to be afraid of,

16:51.500 --> 16:55.208
Graham. It's not that high.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.166
It's not the height

16:55.250 --> 16:57.166
that bothers me,

16:57.208 --> 17:00.166
mainly it's just ladders.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.709
It's totally safe.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.000
And a lot more fun

17:01.750 --> 17:04.000
than going up the stairs.

17:04.041 --> 17:07.834
Wait, there are stairs?

17:07.875 --> 17:09.750
( laughs )

17:13.041 --> 17:15.458
What is your Rescue Team

17:13.041 --> 17:15.458
doing?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.875
They're ruining

17:15.500 --> 17:17.875
my dedication!

17:17.917 --> 17:20.291
No, Mayor, they're saving

17:17.917 --> 17:20.291
your dedication.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.667
Just give your speech,

17:20.333 --> 17:22.667
and I'm sure everyone

17:22.709 --> 17:25.959
will be so mesmerized

17:22.709 --> 17:25.959
they won't even notice my team.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.834
Ah. Yes, yes.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.834
You're right.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.166
( clears throat )

17:31.208 --> 17:34.500
Good morning,

17:31.208 --> 17:34.500
friends and citizens.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.542
As the old saying goes,

17:36.583 --> 17:39.834
even a broken clock

17:36.583 --> 17:39.834
is right twice a day.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.667
( Mayor Luskey chuckles )

17:41.709 --> 17:44.667
Is this on?

17:41.709 --> 17:44.667
But our town's timepiece,

17:44.709 --> 17:46.834
now with state-of-the-art

17:44.709 --> 17:46.834
technology...

17:46.875 --> 17:48.875
Just a precaution,

17:46.875 --> 17:48.875
Mrs. Rubio.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.625
Would you mind parking here

17:48.917 --> 17:51.625
until the dedication is over?

17:51.667 --> 17:54.041
MAYOR LUSKEY:

17:51.667 --> 17:54.041
It's always right.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.750
I think I found the battery.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.166
That's the cannon pinion.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.959
Nuts!

18:00.208 --> 18:02.959
No, I'm sure it's the cannon--

18:03.000 --> 18:06.041
No, look. Nuts!

18:06.083 --> 18:08.250
That's it, Kade.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.250
That's the battery casing.

18:08.291 --> 18:10.709
Well, yeah.

18:08.291 --> 18:10.709
Good thing I'm here.

18:10.750 --> 18:15.208
GRAHAM:

18:10.750 --> 18:15.208
Not sure where the peanuts

18:10.750 --> 18:15.208
came from, but...

18:15.250 --> 18:17.458
Cody.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.458
Just found the battery.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.250
Actually, I found it.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.083
And everything looks fine.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.083
Perimeters are secure.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.125
Everything appears

18:23.125 --> 18:25.125
to be in order.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.709
Thanks, Chase.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.709
Maybe the problem is solved.

18:27.750 --> 18:30.375
Let's hope so. Why don't you

18:27.750 --> 18:30.375
go join your class?

18:30.417 --> 18:32.917
I'll explain things

18:30.417 --> 18:32.917
to your teacher.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.208
Where have you been?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.208
You missed a--

18:37.250 --> 18:38.834
Pop quiz, I know. Don't worry.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.375
I already took it. Twice.

18:40.417 --> 18:43.709
( squirrel chattering )

18:43.750 --> 18:47.583
That little guy sure is

18:43.750 --> 18:47.583
persistent. He runs up there--

18:47.625 --> 18:51.625
Oh, every time! The squirrel!

18:51.667 --> 18:55.333
Down to the millisecond.

18:51.667 --> 18:55.333
It's always right.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.375
Where's Cody going?

18:55.375 --> 18:57.375
I don't know.

18:57.417 --> 18:59.166
We already told him

18:57.417 --> 18:59.166
we handled everything.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.917
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:00.959 --> 19:03.417
( chattering )

19:00.959 --> 19:03.417
You! You're the one...

19:03.458 --> 19:05.375
Stop, stop!

19:03.458 --> 19:05.375
Get away from there!

19:05.417 --> 19:08.458
You're going to hurt yourself

19:05.417 --> 19:08.458
and the clock and--

19:08.500 --> 19:10.458
( imitates cat hissing )

19:10.500 --> 19:12.959
( squirrel chattering )

19:13.000 --> 19:15.041
Phew.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.041
CHIEF:  Cody, are you all right?

19:15.083 --> 19:16.417
Where did you go?

19:16.458 --> 19:18.125
I'm at the top

19:16.458 --> 19:18.125
of the clock tower, Dad.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.125
And everything's fine.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.709
( bell chiming loudly )

19:22.750 --> 19:25.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:25.166 --> 19:26.917
( screams )

19:33.250 --> 19:35.834
( Cody grunts )

19:35.875 --> 19:38.417
Thanks, Heatwave.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.417
Glad you had my back.

19:38.458 --> 19:42.417
Next time stay on the safe side

19:38.458 --> 19:42.417
of the safety rail, okay?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.166
You okay, son?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.000
It worked! I'm still here!

19:50.041 --> 19:52.458
Hmm. The squirrel chewing

19:50.041 --> 19:52.458
through the wire

19:52.500 --> 19:55.250
made the magno-fusion battery

19:52.500 --> 19:55.250
momentarily surge.

19:55.291 --> 19:58.083
That caused the time jolt

19:55.291 --> 19:58.083
that kept sending Cody back.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.959
No matter how you tried

19:58.125 --> 20:00.959
to change things, Cody,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.834
the squirrel had the last word.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.500
GRAHAM:

20:02.875 --> 20:04.500
But I still can't

20:02.875 --> 20:04.500
figure out why

20:04.542 --> 20:06.458
Cody was the only one

20:04.542 --> 20:06.458
affected.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.583
Me either.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.583
But low-tech or not,

20:08.625 --> 20:10.792
I'm sticking with

20:08.625 --> 20:10.792
my old-fashioned watch.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.166
You may have to wind it, but

20:10.834 --> 20:14.166
it won't yank you through time.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.208
Did you just get that?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.792
Yeah,

20:16.250 --> 20:18.792
I just started using it--

20:18.834 --> 20:22.291
This morning!

20:18.834 --> 20:22.291
You don't think--?

20:22.333 --> 20:25.500
Maybe I should have Daddy

20:22.333 --> 20:25.500
take a look at this.

20:25.542 --> 20:28.333
(  light dramatic theme

20:25.542 --> 20:28.333
playing  )

20:28.375 --> 20:31.291
Morning, Cody.

20:28.375 --> 20:31.291
How are you doing?

20:31.333 --> 20:33.709
Happy to be here

20:31.333 --> 20:33.709
on this beautiful new day.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.583
It is a new day, right?

20:36.625 --> 20:38.166
It'd be hard to tell from Kade.

20:38.208 --> 20:41.000
He burns toast every morning.

20:38.208 --> 20:41.000
( bell dings )

20:41.041 --> 20:44.041
And yet your jokes

20:41.041 --> 20:44.041
always seem fresh.

20:44.083 --> 20:47.166
You know, Dad, I was thinking

20:44.083 --> 20:47.166
maybe you could drive me

20:47.208 --> 20:48.750
to school today

20:47.208 --> 20:48.750
so we can catch up.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.291
I'd like that, son.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.709
You were right, Cody.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.709
I just came from Doc's.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.041
This isn't an ordinary

20:52.750 --> 20:55.041
pocket watch.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.083
It contains

20:55.083 --> 20:57.083
the same type of crystal

20:57.125 --> 20:59.375
as the one from the time portal

20:57.125 --> 20:59.375
in the lab.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.375
That's why I was zapped

20:59.417 --> 21:01.375
back in time?

21:01.417 --> 21:04.583
Yep. The energy disruption

21:01.417 --> 21:04.583
in the clock tower battery

21:04.625 --> 21:06.250
interacted with this crystal.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.792
The watch became

21:06.291 --> 21:08.792
a mini time machine.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.208
And it took me back to the exact

21:08.834 --> 21:12.208
time I wound the watch.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.041
This came

21:12.250 --> 21:14.041
from Deputy Barney?

21:14.083 --> 21:16.166
From the lost and found.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.583
(  mysterious theme playing  )

21:21.583 --> 21:22.792
Dad, look!

21:22.834 --> 21:25.542
Well, now we know

21:22.834 --> 21:25.542
who lost it.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.375
Gone but not forgotten.
