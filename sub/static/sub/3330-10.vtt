00:04.704 --> 00:06.638
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:10.709
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:12.778
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:15.280
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:17.783
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.152
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:21.620
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.122
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:25.024
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:26.658
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.296
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:33.499
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:35.734
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:38.570
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:40.506
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.741 --> 00:43.642
Officer: <i>You should have seen</i>
<i>the handful we were</i>

00:43.644 --> 00:45.611
Dealing with at the scene,
like open container violation,

00:45.613 --> 00:49.114
Drunk and disorderly,
resisting arrest.

00:49.116 --> 00:52.151
Resisting arrest?
Yep. We're not
pressing charges

00:52.153 --> 00:53.819
Because of the unique
circumstances,

00:53.821 --> 00:55.187
But next time,

00:55.189 --> 00:58.590
We don't go easy.
Okay. Thank you.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.393
What up, little bro?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.795
Resisting arrest, huh?

01:02.797 --> 01:05.230
I'm half crippled--
I fell into the cop

01:05.232 --> 01:07.833
As he was lifting me
out of the sand.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.401
That's resisting <i>gravity.</i>

01:09.403 --> 01:10.736
Oh, that's not funny.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.238
No, what's not funny
is that I have to spend

01:13.240 --> 01:17.142
Every last minute of my very
short life span in a hospital--

01:17.144 --> 01:20.345
Hospital smell,
hospital people, hospital food--

01:21.314 --> 01:23.749
So... I bailed,

01:23.751 --> 01:25.851
And... I got a six-pack.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.820
Alcohol.
That's, uh, wonderful.

01:27.822 --> 01:30.089
Can we...?
What? Don't take me back yet.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.124
I barely get to see you.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.692
Megan, I visit
every Friday.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.260
Walter, the docs said

01:35.262 --> 01:37.863
In less than a year
I won't be able to walk.

01:37.865 --> 01:41.433
Soon follow.
Nothing is certain.
Ms is fickle.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.868
<i>Life</i> is fickle.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.270
But I want to live
while I still can.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.872
Come on, let me spend
the day with you.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.808
No. No. Okay, get in the car.
See your work,
meet your coworkers.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.310
Come on.
(frustrated groan)

01:51.312 --> 01:52.878
It's not a good idea.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.848
One day, and then I'll go
back to my pt and tests.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.716
(sighs):
Besides...

01:57.718 --> 01:59.284
If you take me to the hospital,

01:59.286 --> 02:01.453
You're just gonna have
to bail me out again.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.157
Are you guys ready?

02:05.159 --> 02:07.192
Hold your horses.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.527
Toby:
All right, sly, we're done.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.295
Okay.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.664
All right, that mug
had 23 clothespins on it,

02:12.666 --> 02:13.899
Which means
you took two.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.367
These erasers aren't level,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.302
Which means you broke
a pencil tip.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.871
Come on, guys,
not cool. And...

02:18.873 --> 02:20.172
You moved that notebook

02:20.174 --> 02:22.174
One-sixteenth
of an inch.
Damn it.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.876
Have fun
writing my case studies...

02:23.878 --> 02:25.210
"suckas."

02:26.813 --> 02:28.180
Get your homework in on time.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.817
Oh, happy.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.552
You know, I would expect
this kind of behavior

02:33.554 --> 02:34.753
From toby, but...

02:37.357 --> 02:38.891
Walter:
Hey.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.759
So, um, (clears throat)

02:40.761 --> 02:42.227
This is my sister megan.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.495
Hi.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.167
Thought you guys
were geniuses.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.701
Someone say something smart.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.869
Hi, megan. I'm so sorry.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.271
I'm paige.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.372
They were just...

02:53.374 --> 02:55.574
Playing a spirited game of...

02:55.576 --> 02:57.342
"move sylvester's
stuff around."

02:57.344 --> 02:59.845
Yeah... So they're
a little out of it.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.513
(chuckles)

03:01.515 --> 03:03.215
Guys, this is when
you introduce yourself.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.383
Yes, okay.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.918
Hello, megan.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.753
Nice to meet you.

03:07.755 --> 03:08.921
Walter has told me
so much about you.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.756
No, he hasn't.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.291
No, he hasn't.
Hey.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.959
Dr. Tobias m. Curtis.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.594
It's a pleasure.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.462
Hey, I'm happy.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.932
And I'm dying, but you don't
see me telling everyone.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.967
Toby:
Yes!

03:21.969 --> 03:24.603
Inappropriate self-deprecating
humor to put others at ease.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.837
I like your approach.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.206
I like your hat.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.311
Can I sit?
Yeah, yeah.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.379
Yeah, um...

03:36.983 --> 03:38.383
Big step for you.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.385
Bringing your sister here.
Mm.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.454
You want titanium.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.256
These are aluminum.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.490
The docs gave you garbage.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.826
Well, I sure wouldn't want
to have ms.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.761
(phone ringing)
oh, gosh.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.497
Did I let my inside voice
get out again?

03:52.499 --> 03:54.766
Walter:
Yeah, cabe?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.368
Yeah, we're all on our way.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.306
Uh, sylvester, you got my bag?

04:01.308 --> 04:03.008
Yeah.
Are you gonna be okay here?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.477
Because we have to go asap.
I don't have time to take you

04:05.479 --> 04:07.279
Back to the hospital.
I'll manage.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.249
General.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.017
Is this your team?
It is, sir.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.553
Toby: Perspiration,
pupil dilation.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.588
Fight-or-flight responses.
Something is certainly up.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.423
All right, what you're
about to hear is classified.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.326
If shared outside these walls,
it's capital treason.

04:21.328 --> 04:22.694
Now, 60 minutes ago,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.963
An f-120 hawkwing carrying

04:24.965 --> 04:26.665
Classified radar
cloaking technology

04:26.667 --> 04:27.766
Went down in bosnia.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.868
Bosnia, is that
still a thing?

04:29.870 --> 04:32.271
Yes, it's a thing.
They're also facing

04:32.273 --> 04:33.605
A violent rebel faction
that wants to overthrow

04:33.607 --> 04:34.973
A legitimately elected
government.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.975
Uh, violent rebels?

04:36.977 --> 04:39.711
The fear is they find
the plane before we do,

04:39.713 --> 04:42.347
Sell its cloaking software
to the highest bidder.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.816
If the buyers can get past
the encryption code,

04:44.818 --> 04:47.352
U.S. Security would be
immediately threatened.

04:47.354 --> 04:51.023
Have been isolated to the
southern part of the country.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.958
It's nowhere near
the crash site.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.459
So you should be safe.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.295
Go in, get the software,
get out.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.629
Why us?
We need a team

04:57.631 --> 05:00.299
With the acumen to extract
technology from hardware

05:00.301 --> 05:02.668
That may be damaged
beyond repair.

05:02.670 --> 05:06.672
If it's so straightforward,
why do we need gi joe here?

05:06.674 --> 05:09.908
It's lieutenant...
James corbett.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.376
My mistake, gi jim.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.878
Corbett:
The hawkwing was piloted

05:12.880 --> 05:14.513
By captain javier barrios.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.915
We're here to escort your team
to the crash site,

05:16.917 --> 05:18.650
Oversee the software extraction,

05:18.652 --> 05:22.321
And bring captain barrios's
remains home to his next of kin.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.722
Just so we're clear,

05:23.724 --> 05:26.358
For our safety,
you'll do exactly

05:26.360 --> 05:29.328
What my team says,
when we say it.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.830
Actually, we're a team, too,
and a pretty smart one,

05:31.832 --> 05:35.000
And we don't work well
when told to follow blindly.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.368
Then get better at it.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.736
What is this guy's problem?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.438
All right,
everyone take it easy.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.406
Okay, um, a moment, please...

05:43.643 --> 05:45.744
Take a step back
instead of forward on this.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.412
Well, he's hostile
and condescending, so...

05:47.414 --> 05:48.647
Well, maybe because

05:48.649 --> 05:51.450
A fellow member
of the military is dead,

05:51.452 --> 05:53.118
And they have
to go find the corpse.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.086
So, before you say something

05:54.088 --> 05:55.587
You can't take back,

05:55.589 --> 05:56.722
Think...

05:56.724 --> 05:57.723
"what would paige say?"

05:57.725 --> 05:59.124
(sighs)

05:59.126 --> 06:00.859
Hi.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.562
I'm sorry, uh...

06:03.564 --> 06:05.864
We're ready to help,
however we can.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.502
You need me on this one,

06:10.504 --> 06:12.371
'cause you're going to either be

06:12.373 --> 06:13.538
Defending our team
from the seals

06:13.540 --> 06:14.940
Or trying to kill
them yourself.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.744
You're okay with going
to another country for 36 hours,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.078
Leaving your kid behind?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.613
I'll call drew;
he'll watch ralph.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.682
I can handle this.
I'm part of the team.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.050
Part of it?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.486
You're the glue, kid.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.755
Sylvester:
Walter, you know,

06:29.757 --> 06:32.090
The military's only gonna get
you a 20 square mile radius

06:32.092 --> 06:34.059
On the location of that jet,

06:34.061 --> 06:37.062
I can get you a location
for that plane

06:37.064 --> 06:39.598
In your phone
by the time you land

06:39.600 --> 06:40.966
Within 300 yards.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.868
Great.
I need to do it from the garage.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.836
I want to make some phone calls,
I want to get

06:44.838 --> 06:46.505
Into some old theorem binders.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.673
I want to get this right.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.142
That's a good idea, yeah.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.877
Okay.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.678
Um, you know,
can you do me a favor?

06:53.680 --> 06:56.681
Can you keep
a close eye on megan for me?

06:56.683 --> 06:58.683
She, uh, she won't let you

06:58.685 --> 07:00.085
Take her back to the hospital.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.453
She's stubborn.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.654
Sure, yeah.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.688
I'll do that.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.491
Okay. Thank you.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.093
Are you the people

07:08.095 --> 07:10.061
Who are going to bring
my husband's body back?

07:15.635 --> 07:17.436
Uh, th...

07:17.438 --> 07:18.870
This team will do all it can.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.206
When you find him,

07:21.208 --> 07:23.475
Please remove his necklace

07:23.477 --> 07:24.709
And keep it safe.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.645
He wanted to pass it
down to his son.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.550
And put this
in his pocket...

07:32.819 --> 07:35.487
...So we can help
guide him home.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.990
Sure.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.001
Hi.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.169
(gasps)
your brother found that

07:51.171 --> 07:53.505
In a junkyard
and he restored it.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.707
I don't think he'd appreciate
the extra flair.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.209
And you should probably
come down.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.243
Hey, speaking of walter...

07:58.245 --> 07:59.511
Mm-hmm?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.046
He called and filled me in.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.214
Bosnia?

08:02.216 --> 08:03.782
That's pretty crazy.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.817
Yes, it is.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.220
And do you guys always handle
such heavy-duty stuff?

08:08.222 --> 08:11.156
Unfortunately. Look, megan,
I'd love to speak to you,

08:11.158 --> 08:12.224
But I need to locate
a 70-foot-long plane

08:12.226 --> 08:15.060
In 300 square miles
of wilderness.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.261
So...

08:16.263 --> 08:18.063
Here.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.498
You can play solitaire.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.233
Odds of winning are 13%.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.934
Good luck.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.237
Have fun.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.939
â™ª

08:52.098 --> 08:54.165
â™ª

08:58.771 --> 09:00.605
Walter: What's with
the armament?

09:00.607 --> 09:03.608
I thought this wasn't
hostile territory.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.610
We're breaching an area
with confirmed unfriendlies.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.578
We go prepared.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.580
Toby:
You said "we,"

09:08.582 --> 09:10.549
But <i>we</i> don't have weapons.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.617
You don't.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.120
(ramp whirring shut)

09:15.122 --> 09:16.688
Not good.

09:20.092 --> 09:23.161
(crickets chirping)

09:30.136 --> 09:32.237
I know we have to be covert,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.805
But maybe we don't hit
every pothole,

09:33.807 --> 09:35.774
If you gave the lights
a soft tap.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.242
We navigate by moonlight.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.910
It's safer.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.684
Walter: Now, according to
sylvester's sms, we head

09:45.686 --> 09:47.719
Another three miles,
veer northwest,

09:47.721 --> 09:49.588
And the plane will be
seven miles ahead.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.690
(bang, then air hissing)

10:02.602 --> 10:04.069
Blown tire.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.171
No spares.
Nice road your guy

10:06.173 --> 10:07.238
Sent us on.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.940
I hope this doesn't
slow us down.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.310
I recognize
the emotions involved,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.679
But, uh, tokens, talismans,

10:14.681 --> 10:15.914
There's no logic to it.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.382
It's a sign of weakness.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.618
No, it's a sign of humanity.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.086
Yeah, exactly.
Happy: This is stupid.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.822
I'm sure I can temp-patch
this thing.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.625
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? Extinguish that...

10:26.627 --> 10:29.127
(gunfire, clamoring)
fall back!

10:29.129 --> 10:31.196
Take cover!
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:32.665 --> 10:35.266
(toby whimpering)

10:35.268 --> 10:38.169
Stay down, stay down,
stay down, stay down!

10:46.879 --> 10:49.781
(intense gunfire)
corbett: Stay down! Stay down!

10:52.918 --> 10:54.886
We'll run between fire gaps,
deep into the woods,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.788
There's more coverage.
I'd prefer not to.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.056
(gunfire, bullets ricocheting)

10:58.058 --> 10:59.157
Now!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.026
(groans)

11:04.163 --> 11:06.331
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.732
Look at me, look at me.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.334
We will get out of this.
How?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.435
Rebels got us pinned. Any ideas?

11:10.437 --> 11:14.305
Yeah. When it gets bright, run.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.444
Go, go, go, go, go!
Let's go, let's go!

11:19.446 --> 11:21.680
This just got serious!
Don't look, just run!

11:21.682 --> 11:23.848
(both yelling)

11:23.850 --> 11:26.317
(grunting)

11:28.921 --> 11:29.954
(groaning)

11:29.956 --> 11:33.024
Oh. My pancreas.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.859
(groans quietly)

11:34.861 --> 11:36.194
You okay?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.762
I'm peachy.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.368
All right, hey,
stop here. Stop.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.941
Where's happy and toby?

11:49.943 --> 11:52.210
You are not lighting up that
phone's display out here.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.211
Two of my team
are missing--

11:53.213 --> 11:55.313
I'm calling them.

12:02.121 --> 12:03.388
Walt?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.290
Happy, where are you?
I have no idea.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.959
Toby and I fell down
the side of a ravine.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.294
Looking up
at a 300-foot cliff.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.396
We also lost our food
and water during the fall.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.166
Hey, check your map.
We need to locate them.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.302
The map's in the truck.
Along with our rapelling gear.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.037
There's no way we can
risk going back, so...

12:19.039 --> 12:21.306
Their only option's to hold
tight until conditions change.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.807
We need to move.
Those rebels

12:22.809 --> 12:24.342
Are gonna regroup
and be on us in no time.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.244
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.847
Sylvester!
Cabe, I'm gonna call him.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.881
That nervous kid?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.216
We can count on him.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.786
He's a professional.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.055
Megan: Ooh, and chopped nuts!

12:37.057 --> 12:38.490
(whispering):
You're chopping my nuts.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.458
(gasps) oh, my god!

12:40.460 --> 12:43.361
You're the best.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.763
Mmm-mmm.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.931
This is so good!

12:46.933 --> 12:49.234
(phone ringing)
okay.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.301
Hello?
Sylvester?

12:50.303 --> 12:51.336
Walter!

12:51.338 --> 12:52.437
We got a problem. Uh...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.372
We lost happy and toby.
They're lost.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.874
Are you sure?!

12:55.876 --> 12:57.342
Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure
I would notice them

12:57.344 --> 13:00.445
We gonna need
high-def sat images

13:00.447 --> 13:03.314
Of the area to pinpoint
their location

13:03.316 --> 13:05.450
At around a 10-mile radius

13:05.452 --> 13:07.452
With a latitude of 44

13:07.454 --> 13:10.455
Okay.
Walter, is everything okay?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.823
Yeah, just a...

13:11.825 --> 13:12.891
A little hiccup. Um...

13:12.893 --> 13:14.125
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.261
Forget about me.
You're lost in bosnia.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.030
Okay. Walter, I got it!
There should be a cliff or

13:19.032 --> 13:21.232
A ravine they fell down.
Sylvester: Yes.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.233
I see it.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.835
Okay, in about six miles,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.804
The plateau you're on
and the ravine will converge.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.106
After that, it's just woods,
it's desolate.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.474
But you can meet up there.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.842
You guys hear that?

13:30.844 --> 13:32.811
Yeah, and we don't like it.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.045
We get lost out here,

13:34.047 --> 13:36.080
We're dead in three
days without water.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.148
Cabe:
You listen up.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.283
You have no options.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.318
Now, tough it up and be smart.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.420
Keep your head down, and stay
out of open spaces when you can.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.923
And don't use your phone unless
it's absolutely necessary.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.024
It might give you away.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.325
Roger that.
And toby...

13:47.327 --> 13:48.359
Yes?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.427
Happy's in charge.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.862
What...?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.931
We better get going.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.368
Oh!

13:57.370 --> 13:58.369
I should look at that.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.471
Who's in charge?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.840
You are.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.274
Got an issue over here.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.512
You were hit?

14:07.514 --> 14:08.880
Yeah, didn't realize it

14:08.882 --> 14:10.515
Till the adrenaline
started to wear off.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.517
Clean it, dress it.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.386
We got to get to the plane
before the rebels get to us.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.455
Roger that.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.425
This is you...
Hey!

14:20.427 --> 14:21.492
And your team's fault.
Hey, give me that phone.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.527
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stand down.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.395
I know you're hot.
Take a breath.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.966
No. You'll get this back
when we're on our way home.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.369
It was your truck

14:31.371 --> 14:33.538
From your contact
that broke down.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.040
The only protocol that's worked
so far on this mission

14:36.042 --> 14:37.075
Are the sat phones--

14:37.077 --> 14:38.409
Technology designed by someone

14:38.411 --> 14:40.545
Who's a lot more
like me than you!

14:40.547 --> 14:43.548
Guys, we all have people
we're worried about.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.582
Including...

14:44.584 --> 14:46.017
This woman and child.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.585
This is why we're here.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.457
This is what's
worth fighting for.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.194
Copy that.
Right.

15:00.366 --> 15:03.434
Sylvester, you look like you're
gonna have a heart attack.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.303
I'm trying to hack bosnia's
ministry of the interior

15:05.305 --> 15:08.039
To see if they have
any intel on rebel positions.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.908
But it's gonna take me a while.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.309
Especially if this
decryption software

15:11.311 --> 15:13.278
Won't download.
Ten minutes? Come on!

15:13.280 --> 15:15.146
Ten minutes? Okay.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.314
You need a break.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.683
I thought you can
tell me about this.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.686
I found it in walter's room.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.957
When I was 12,

15:25.959 --> 15:27.425
I lost this.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.161
I looked everywhere for it.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.063
Walter even helped.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.165
Any idea why he has it?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.367
No. Walter's a private person.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.369
Well, how about this?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.339
The coronet room?

15:41.341 --> 15:42.941
That's the sleazy casino

15:42.943 --> 15:44.475
Toby used to hustle in.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.710
That's where walter met him.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.178
My brother doesn't gamble.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.048
When he was raising capital
to start scorpion,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.716
He'd get staked by high rollers

15:51.718 --> 15:53.685
And he'd clean out
poker rooms for a cut.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.420
That's where he met toby

15:55.422 --> 15:57.555
About to get his butt
kicked by a pit boss.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.491
So walter intervened and
worked off all of toby's debt.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.726
Really?

16:01.728 --> 16:03.995
Mm-hmm.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.699
How about this motel key?

16:09.201 --> 16:11.669
I don't want to talk about that.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.606
I have to get
back to work.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.210
Cabe:
There's the plane.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.713
My god, burnt to a crisp.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.450
Where's the pilot's body?

16:25.452 --> 16:28.252
He was trapped in a metal box
at 1,400 degrees.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.520
He was incinerated.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.522
Paige, what are you doing?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.558
I'm finding the necklace.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.627
I'm bringing it back to his son.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.662
It's just jewelry.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.697
It's more than that.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.336
Walter:
Paige...

16:45.338 --> 16:47.105
It's melted. It's gone.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.073
I'm sorry.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.543
Okay.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.145
Just recover the cloaking
software we came for.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.280
We'll hump it
back to the plane.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.019
He had a son.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.554
I just want to finish
the job and go home, cabe.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.656
Walter:
Hold on, hold on!

17:05.658 --> 17:08.760
There's no way it would be
in a state-of-the-art aircraft.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.628
What are you saying--
they swapped it?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.330
It was planted.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.465
It was made to look like
it was destroyed in the fire,

17:14.467 --> 17:16.634
Which was
deliberately set.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.302
The software's
already been stolen.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.204
That's not the only thing taken.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.439
There's blood here,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.274
A good 12 feet
from the plane.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.642
There's no way that
body leaves that plane

17:24.644 --> 17:26.611
Unless he survived the crash.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.515
Corbett:
He's right.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.749
Barrios is alive.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.153
Rebels saw the plane fall,

17:35.155 --> 17:38.356
Tracked it, took our pilot.
God knows what they're doing

17:38.358 --> 17:40.625
To him to get the encryption
code for that software.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.427
Okay, we have
to track down that software.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.328
I think you mean
captain barrios?

17:44.330 --> 17:46.464
They're both together.
You know what I mean.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.099
Cabe: All right,
listen up.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.835
Here on in,
we work together.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.538
This is no longer
a simple extraction.

17:53.540 --> 17:57.375
Our recovery mission is
now a rescue offensive.

18:00.612 --> 18:03.314
Now, get your game face on...

18:03.316 --> 18:06.551
Because we're not leaving
this country without our pilot.

18:10.789 --> 18:15.426
(groaning, gasping)

18:15.428 --> 18:17.295
Let us try again.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.097
What is encryption code?

18:19.099 --> 18:21.265
Huh?

18:21.267 --> 18:22.767
Captain javier barrios.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.768
Service number...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.703
(grunts)

18:27.206 --> 18:30.775
Hey, hey, hey.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.809
I know your name.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.511
I know your rank.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.646
I know your service number.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.814
I also know date
in which you die

18:36.816 --> 18:39.417
If you do not cooperate.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.823
Little baton, huh?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.693
(electrical crackling)
(javier screaming)

18:48.695 --> 18:51.362
He's got people shot,
people missing,

18:51.364 --> 18:53.164
And he can still
focus on his work.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.200
It worries me I no longer
find this abnormal.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.703
With walter,
abnormal is normal.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.272
Walter: Okay, so according
to the black box data,

19:01.274 --> 19:04.208
This plane thought it was
over sarajevo when it crashed.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.576
Meaning what?

19:05.578 --> 19:06.577
Meaning mechanical failure

19:06.579 --> 19:07.745
Didn't bring this plane down.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.882
The navigation coordinates
were corrupted.

19:10.884 --> 19:14.452
And that's why the black box
couldn't send its ping signal.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.754
Corbett: The rebels were aware
of the routine recon flights.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.756
They just waited for a plane to
pass over and made their move.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.591
Yeah.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.593
To hack the plane's defenses,

19:22.595 --> 19:24.729
They'd need to be
at an elevated altitude,

19:24.731 --> 19:26.731
Sending a powerful,
uninterrupted

19:26.733 --> 19:28.599
Signal.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.801
Could be done with a
well-positioned satellite dish.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.471
So, according to the topography,

19:33.473 --> 19:35.339
The signal would've most likely
come from somewhere west.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.741
Cabe: Well, let's get
to high ground.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.577
See if we can't find
the source of that signal.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.212
And maybe
who took our pilot.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.616
Hey.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.351
You figuring all that out?

19:47.353 --> 19:48.920
You're what seals call
a professor.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.289
I'll take that as a compliment.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.523
It is.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.193
I am so hungry

19:55.195 --> 19:56.961
I would eat my hat
if I still had it.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.962
I loved that hat.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.597
(groans)
look, you're injured.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.966
Swallow that pride,
let me take a look.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.234
I'm a doctor.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.268
You're a psychiatrist.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.836
I went to medical school.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.539
Fine.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.941
Just make it quick.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.487
You have a foot fetish
or something? Hurry it up.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.857
You got a sprain and I'm
concerned about that cut.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.326
Since we don't
have any ointment,

20:28.328 --> 20:29.961
I'll do my best
to stabilize it.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.402
Why aren't you a real doctor?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.738
I am a real doctor.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.573
You know what I mean.
Why a shrink?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.710
If you must know,
my mother was nuts.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.812
She was clinically bipolar.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.880
And I watched my dad struggle
to manage her illness,

20:49.882 --> 20:52.350
So I became a shrink to
try to help them both.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.784
That didn't work.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.420
Geez, happy, you
know that there are

20:56.422 --> 20:57.922
Whole sections of the
internet that would pay

20:57.924 --> 20:59.790
Top dollar for a
peek at these toes.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.526
Why do you do that?

21:02.528 --> 21:05.329
As soon as you become human,
you switch to wise-ass.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.398
It's a textbook
defense mechanism

21:07.400 --> 21:09.867
To hide how I feel.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.702
Especially around you.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.873
You're so smart and capable

21:15.875 --> 21:18.009
And fun... And that
personality

21:18.011 --> 21:20.811
Happens to be wrapped
in a nice little package.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.781
So I say stupid things
to hide feelings

21:23.783 --> 21:25.049
That you already
know that I have.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.917
And we got no food,

21:26.919 --> 21:29.887
Water or idea where we are,
so if we're gonna die,

21:29.889 --> 21:32.823
I might as well say
some stuff, so there.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.826
Are you done?

21:37.362 --> 21:39.363
Do you see that?

21:39.365 --> 21:40.998
You are doing exactly
what you said I do.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.933
When things get real,
I make wisecracks.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.702
You put on your armor.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.908
Look.

21:50.910 --> 21:51.876
Maybe there's
supplies up there.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.612
Oh, that's a good idea, gretel.

21:54.614 --> 21:57.415
Let's go to the creepy cottage
on the hill.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.717
Oh, grow a pair.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.322
(sniffs)

22:07.793 --> 22:09.393
(paige gasping)

22:12.764 --> 22:14.365
Everyone stand fast,
right where you are.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.934
We're in a minefield.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.869
Russian made.
Circa world war ii.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.905
Leftovers from the '95 war.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.340
The soviets sold 'em
at a fire sale.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.708
Can we double back?
You 100% positive

22:23.710 --> 22:25.376
Of every step
you took to get here?

22:25.378 --> 22:27.044
No way the rebels
didn't hear that.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.448
Atv, 40 miles per hour,
10 clicks back...

22:30.450 --> 22:31.649
They'll be on us in...

22:31.651 --> 22:35.386
We gotta move out of here.
The question is where?

22:35.388 --> 22:37.021
What about to the flowers?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.689
If I'm gonna blow up,
I'd rather die

22:38.691 --> 22:41.058
In a purple patch of lilies
than die in the dirt.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.094
No one's blowing up.

22:43.096 --> 22:45.129
We're gonna figure this out.
Right, walt?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.134
Walt?

22:50.136 --> 22:52.670
No, paige. You're wrong.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.505
We're not gonna die
in the flowers.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.506
That's where it's safe.

22:55.508 --> 22:56.941
Explain.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.642
All the flowers are
in bunches, right?

22:58.644 --> 23:00.478
Everywhere else is dead field.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.479
Why?

23:01.481 --> 23:02.780
The mines.
Walter:
Yeah.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.014
The mines are leaking
corrosive chemicals

23:04.016 --> 23:05.816
That will kill any plant
that grows above.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.685
So there's no mines
under the flowers,

23:07.687 --> 23:09.086
But what about in-between?

23:09.088 --> 23:10.788
Well, no plan's perfect.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.427
Yeah, well...

23:16.429 --> 23:18.496
Looks like we're safe
up to here.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.097
Come on.

23:20.099 --> 23:24.802
Step exactly where the person
in front of you steps.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.670
Travel single-file,
and do it fast.

23:26.672 --> 23:27.671
In a few minutes,

23:27.673 --> 23:29.473
We're getting shot at again.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.415
For the record, if we
get hacked up right now,

23:37.417 --> 23:39.650
I'm gonna be very upset.

23:46.858 --> 23:47.992
Happy:
Lights on.

23:49.461 --> 23:52.029
But no one's inside.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.632
(comedy show playing on tv)

23:54.634 --> 23:57.435
(on tv):
Oh, hey, your hand's dirty.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.936
You better go have it
steam-cleaned or something.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.071
Girl 2:
Why, you little...

24:01.073 --> 24:03.741
Woman: I'm mrs. Garrett,
the school dietician.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.709
You must be... Jo,
the new student.

24:05.711 --> 24:06.777
Hi, how's it going?

24:06.779 --> 24:09.046
Did we enter a cabin
or a wormhole?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.514
Someone was just here.

24:10.516 --> 24:11.615
We gotta hurry.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.551
Grab any food
that's not tied down.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.086
We need water,
we need protein.

24:17.989 --> 24:18.989
Hey...

24:18.991 --> 24:21.025
(speaking croatian)

24:22.828 --> 24:24.628
Listen, man, we don't
want any trouble.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.064
We're just lost hikers.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.833
Americans.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.670
Igor loves usa!

24:49.554 --> 24:51.188
Okay, you go through

24:51.190 --> 24:52.690
The last bunch of flowers,

24:52.692 --> 24:54.758
Get on this hill,
and we're fine.

24:57.529 --> 24:58.596
Thank you.

24:59.531 --> 25:00.764
Okay.

25:01.900 --> 25:02.967
(click)

25:04.102 --> 25:05.669
Jim...?

25:05.671 --> 25:08.706
No, back away.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.509
I just tripped a mine.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.851
Okay, okay.
Hold still, hold still.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.253
No, no-- get out--
get out of here!

25:22.255 --> 25:23.888
Don't move.
Listen to me.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.523
You got me out
of a firefight;

25:25.525 --> 25:27.024
I can get you
out of this.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.093
Igor:
Is nice to have visitors.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.929
I live here for
six months out of the year.

25:31.931 --> 25:35.633
Manage satellite
for, uh, government.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.636
It's not, uh, best job,
but I get all the u.S. Shows.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.104
Blair! Tootie!

25:40.106 --> 25:42.673
Uh, learn <i>facts of life.</i>

25:42.675 --> 25:43.774
Hey, igor, you mind

25:43.776 --> 25:45.543
If we use your computer?
We're lost

25:45.545 --> 25:46.677
And really need
to find our friends.

25:46.679 --> 25:47.978
It's a matter of survival.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.179
(grunts)

25:49.181 --> 25:51.248
Walter:
Maybe I can deactivate
the detonator.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.053
Go easy.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.858
Okay, this is bad.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.226
If the pressure shift
doesn't detonate this,

26:02.228 --> 26:03.861
There's a back-up timer.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.863
What are we looking at?

26:05.865 --> 26:08.832
Walter...
Walter:
You need to get
out of here.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.801
I do not want you here
if this does not work.

26:10.803 --> 26:11.969
Cabe:
Get her out of here.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.139
Just need to cut the right cord.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.574
No. Cabe...

26:16.576 --> 26:18.275
Get him out of here.
Son, you gotta move!

26:18.277 --> 26:19.143
I can do this.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.945
Jim:
It's speeding up!

26:20.947 --> 26:22.780
Take off, o'brien!
I've almost got it!

26:22.782 --> 26:25.983
Hold on... Hold on...
No, there's no time!

26:25.985 --> 26:27.851
Walter:
One second, one second...
Jim: It's going off!

26:27.853 --> 26:28.919
(sudden clank, crackling)

26:31.823 --> 26:33.357
What happened?

26:35.360 --> 26:36.994
We're alive.

26:38.663 --> 26:41.765
Uh... Must've corroded
so much over time...

26:41.767 --> 26:43.634
It's become a dud.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.337
I know green berets...

26:46.339 --> 26:47.938
But you're crazy.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.108
Toby:
This is delicious.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.177
It's tongue.
You're eating tongue.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.916
Look what he
had minimized--

26:58.918 --> 27:00.651
A massive transmission
that was sent by satellite.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.919
What kind of
transmission?

27:01.921 --> 27:02.920
Coordinates.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.788
False gps coordinates.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.657
Sent roughly
24 hours ago.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.995
Well, that's just about the time
our plane went down.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.403
Happy:
Not so fast, comrade!

27:19.405 --> 27:20.971
Why the hell did you
crash that plane?

27:21.973 --> 27:24.708
Now I see why
cabe put you in charge.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.909
I know nothing of a plane.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.978
Just manage satellite
for government.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.814
Okay, okay! Don't shoot.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.183
Bad men come.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.852
They pay me money
to use satellite.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.086
They send pornography--

27:36.088 --> 27:37.855
It's illegal,

27:37.857 --> 27:39.957
But I have no choice.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.992
Even timbre,
level eye-white exposure;

27:41.994 --> 27:42.926
He's telling the truth.

27:42.928 --> 27:44.962
They weren't sending porn.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.930
They were rebels
taking down a jet.

27:46.932 --> 27:48.799
Igor hates rebels.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.034
You know where
the rebels are right now?

27:52.404 --> 27:53.404
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

27:53.406 --> 27:54.405
Slow down.
Slow down.

27:54.407 --> 27:55.406
You're where?

27:55.408 --> 27:57.041
At a hilltop
sat station.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.176
We think you're walking
right into the rebel base.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.711
I'm texting you
the coordinates now.

28:00.713 --> 28:01.979
Walter:
Rebel base?

28:01.981 --> 28:03.414
That's exactly what
we're looking for.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.982
Isn't the idea to
avoid the rebels?

28:04.984 --> 28:07.751
But they have our software
and the pilot.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.386
Oh. The base isn't

28:09.388 --> 28:10.888
That far from here.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.456
The odds are that's where
they brought our man.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.924
We're going in to find him.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.794
Suddenly I am glad we
fell down that ravine.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.395
Walt, that doesn't sound safe.

28:18.397 --> 28:21.031
You hike a mile east
of the main road

28:21.033 --> 28:22.900
Outside the rebel compound.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.234
We'll rendezvous there.

28:24.236 --> 28:27.938
Now, if we don't show
by nightfall, then...

28:27.940 --> 28:29.139
Find your way back home.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.175
Hey, walter, weren't we guys

28:31.177 --> 28:33.043
Who just fixed computers,
like, yesterday?

28:33.045 --> 28:34.878
Yeah, looks like
we're more than that now.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.815
Okay, we need radio silence
from here on out.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.349
Bye.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.051
I hope to see you guys soon.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.789
Before we jump
into this mess,

28:45.791 --> 28:47.091
I want to thank you
for what you did

28:47.093 --> 28:48.192
Back there
at the minefield.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.060
It was no big deal.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.295
Had a problem, saw a solution.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.963
You know, it was
pretty impressive,

28:52.965 --> 28:55.065
What you did with that,
uh, rocket launcher.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.834
Ah, no big deal.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.001
Had a problem,
saw a solution.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.872
Here...

29:01.874 --> 29:03.006
I thought you
could use this.

29:03.008 --> 29:06.910
Spilled half of it
on the way here, but...

29:06.912 --> 29:08.345
What do you expect from a girl
whose nerve endings

29:08.347 --> 29:09.346
Are slowly deteriorating?

29:09.348 --> 29:11.982
That's a terrible thing to say.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.952
What are you afraid of,
sylvester?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.854
Everything.
No.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.355
I mean the motel key.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.828
Hey, you can trust me.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.830
What's bothering you?

29:33.037 --> 29:35.005
Okay.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.377
The way I am...

29:40.379 --> 29:42.079
Frustrated my parents.

29:43.047 --> 29:45.082
So, when I was 16,

29:45.084 --> 29:48.485
I hacked a bank

29:48.487 --> 29:50.387
And I stole $2,500

29:50.389 --> 29:51.922
And I ran away.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.891
Soon, I was broke

29:53.893 --> 29:56.994
And alone and...

29:56.996 --> 29:59.129
Scared...

29:59.131 --> 30:00.964
In a crappy motel room.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.533
I was in a bad place,

30:02.535 --> 30:06.470
Considering... Bad things.

30:08.106 --> 30:11.275
Until a forensic analyst
from the bank

30:11.277 --> 30:12.810
Tracked me down.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.211
Walter.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.813
To this day,

30:15.815 --> 30:18.248
The bank still thinks
I was never apprehended.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.083
Walter's the only
person on earth

30:20.085 --> 30:21.418
Who knows this story.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.121
He was there
for me.

30:24.123 --> 30:27.457
And now I'm not there for him.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.394
You... You have worked
really hard...

30:30.396 --> 30:32.129
No.
You found
the satellite photos...

30:32.131 --> 30:34.231
No, no. I told him

30:34.233 --> 30:36.600
I had to work from here
and that was a lie.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.602
I was afraid to go.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.170
And he knew.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.205
And he let me stay.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.040
That's how good a friend he is

30:43.042 --> 30:45.108
And that's how lousy I am.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.079
Luke:
Looks like a run-down farmhouse.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.380
Hold on.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.448
Look.

30:53.384 --> 30:56.320
Those farmers are
armed to the teeth.

30:56.322 --> 31:00.023
I don't remember old macdonald
having a gun in that song.

31:00.025 --> 31:03.093
My pilot, your software;
they're both in that barn.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.428
You ready to go get what's ours?

31:04.430 --> 31:06.129
That's what
we came for.

31:06.131 --> 31:09.066
Walter and I will have cover
to breach the compound,

31:09.068 --> 31:10.100
Retrieve barrios,

31:10.102 --> 31:11.268
Recover the tech.
Cabe, luke...

31:11.270 --> 31:12.970
You steal the van

31:12.972 --> 31:14.538
And sneak around back
and pick us up.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.573
Paige,
simon's out of commission.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.041
Get him down
to the service road.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.042
We'll pick you up,
then we're oscar mike.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.043
Copy?
Copy.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.111
All right.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.383
Paige:
Hey.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.552
Hey.
I'd off you
a good-luck charm,

31:28.554 --> 31:30.921
But I know you don't
believe in that, so...

31:30.923 --> 31:32.289
Just get back safe, okay?

31:32.291 --> 31:34.258
Okay.

31:43.935 --> 31:45.602
Ooh! Oh, that's gonna hurt.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.137
All right.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.605
As soon as I open this door,
it's gonna get hot.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.108
Stay back until
the shooting's over.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.477
That seems logical.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.022
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.360
Okay.

32:11.396 --> 32:14.097
Three, two, one.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.566
(javier screaming in distance)

32:22.307 --> 32:23.373
(javier groans)

32:29.047 --> 32:31.114
(electricity crackles,
javier screams)

32:33.484 --> 32:35.252
(electricity crackles,
javier screams)

32:36.220 --> 32:38.021
(electricity crackles,
javier screams)

32:38.023 --> 32:39.623
Rebel:
What is encryption code?

32:39.625 --> 32:40.991
(electricity crackles,
javier groans)

32:40.993 --> 32:42.292
Give us the code!

32:42.294 --> 32:44.594
(electricity buzzing,
javier screaming)

32:44.596 --> 32:46.263
Careful.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.065
There's a fuel vat
right next to him.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.733
(electricity buzzes,
javier groans)

32:52.303 --> 32:53.303
(electricity buzzing,
javier groaning)

32:53.305 --> 32:54.504
Rebel:
Yes...

32:56.174 --> 32:57.407
(speaks native language)

33:14.326 --> 33:17.227
Lieutenant jim corbett,
u.S. Navy seals.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.062
I'm bringing you home.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.598
I'm the tech guy.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.101
I'm helping.

33:38.649 --> 33:39.716
(engine turns, then stops)

33:39.718 --> 33:41.518
You gotta be kidding me.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.657
Fan belt's gone.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.326
The fan belt?

33:49.328 --> 33:50.660
Uh, why are you
calling me?

33:50.662 --> 33:52.329
Happy is the expert.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.664
Cabe: Because we're not
in burbank, we're in bosnia,

33:54.666 --> 33:56.266
And we got shoddy reception.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.268
Now, we're storming
a rebel base,

33:58.270 --> 34:00.170
So I need you to man up, son.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.172
Our life depends on it.

34:02.174 --> 34:05.208
Okay, we need something
strong yet pliable

34:05.210 --> 34:07.177
That can withstand
the coefficient of friction.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.146
Something like... Pantyhose.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.515
Now, why the hell
would I have pantyhose?

34:12.583 --> 34:13.784
I got a multi-tool,

34:13.786 --> 34:15.652
12 mags of ammo, first aid kit,

34:15.654 --> 34:17.120
Toilet paper.

34:17.122 --> 34:18.455
The toilet paper!

34:18.457 --> 34:20.123
Okay, pull it into long strips,

34:20.125 --> 34:21.691
And braid it
in a hexagonal pattern.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.195
This makes the paper increase
its strength exponentially.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.330
Hooke's law
of elasticity.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.299
How'd you know that?
Who's my brother?

34:29.301 --> 34:31.168
I'm bound to pick up something.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.206
I got him.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.407
Grab the tech, let's go.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.575
Okay.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.243
(gun cocks)
oh...

34:46.350 --> 34:48.285
You think
you can come here,

34:48.287 --> 34:49.686
Take what you want?

34:54.258 --> 34:56.726
From me?

34:56.728 --> 34:58.128
From my country?!
Walter: Stop!

34:58.130 --> 34:59.596
Beat him all you
like, it's useless.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.364
He can't help you.

35:02.233 --> 35:03.767
I can.
You?

35:03.769 --> 35:05.869
I don't even know what you are.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.404
All right?

35:10.475 --> 35:12.542
I'll tell you what I'm not,
I'm not a soldier.

35:12.544 --> 35:16.580
I'm a tech specialist sent in
to get that software,

35:16.582 --> 35:17.747
And I will get
it for you,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.316
But you have to let us go.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.818
You-you really think
they're gonna let us go?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.387
You tried your way.

35:24.389 --> 35:25.422
Do we have a deal?

35:25.424 --> 35:28.325
You decode it, you leave.

35:42.673 --> 35:43.673
Okay.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.275
We're done.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.911
Now we go?

35:47.913 --> 35:50.347
No, you not leave till
software's fully downloaded.

35:59.223 --> 36:00.724
(engine turns, then stops)

36:02.860 --> 36:05.862
(engine turns, then stops)

36:19.343 --> 36:21.411
You erased it?!

36:21.413 --> 36:23.446
Now!

36:30.788 --> 36:32.756
Drop it.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.325
My bosses be upset
I not bring them software.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.861
So, instead,
I bring them your head.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.602
(shouts, gasps)

36:52.243 --> 36:53.810
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey--
we gotta go.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.478
Oscar mike.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.846
Oh, so you're speaking
the lingo now?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.352
Okay, hold on...

37:02.354 --> 37:03.620
Walter:
Where the hell is he?

37:03.622 --> 37:05.488
Come on, cabe.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.726
Welcome to the
charmin express.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.799
Go, go, go, go, go, go...!

37:20.238 --> 37:21.838
I was nervous you wouldn't show.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.640
Wasn't without
its drama.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.709
Your wife wanted you
to have this.

37:29.347 --> 37:31.348
Thank you.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.916
Thanks to all of you.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.784
Actually, we're
not all here.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.653
I thought we would have
seen them by now.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.722
When we get to the plane,
we'll call the embassy

37:38.724 --> 37:40.323
And form a search party.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.525
Don't know if
that's necessary.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.538
None of you saw this.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.879
â™ª

38:08.653 --> 38:10.720
How you feeling, pal?

38:12.523 --> 38:13.723
Such a liar.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.698
(sighs)
it's good to be home.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.366
You see him?

38:23.368 --> 38:24.968
Go give him a hug.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.474
Not bad for
two days' work.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.543
Not at all.

38:33.545 --> 38:36.546
But I really want
to see my son now.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.448
Copy that.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.517
Glad to give you
a lift.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.421
You know the sad thing--

38:44.423 --> 38:46.990
That was my first time
outside the u.S.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.793
Hey.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.363
Yeah.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.497
I want you to have this.

38:57.468 --> 38:58.835
It's our unit's
challenge coin...

39:00.938 --> 39:03.440
...For exemplary service
on a mission.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.478
Okay.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.713
Hey, okay, um...

39:09.715 --> 39:12.115
Hold on a second.

39:13.584 --> 39:16.052
Take this.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.588
It's an override code
for your dvr.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.523
Free war movies for life.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.059
Come on.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.395
Okay.

39:25.397 --> 39:29.499
â™ª

39:30.568 --> 39:33.470
If I was any more exhausted,
I'd melt into a puddle.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.505
Sylvester: You guys
are back! Walter!

39:35.507 --> 39:36.606
Hey!

39:36.608 --> 39:37.774
How you doing?

39:37.776 --> 39:40.377
Okay.

39:40.379 --> 39:43.680
I will be with you
on the mission, I promise.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.115
You were, pal,
you were right there.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.717
No. Bullets weren't
flying in here.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.119
I'll be there.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.122
Hey, toby.

39:52.124 --> 39:54.524
For the record, you took good
care of me, and I appreciate it.

39:54.526 --> 39:55.658
Thank you.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.961
I could take
better care of you.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.697
You never give up.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.600
Good.

40:12.643 --> 40:15.078
Quite a life
you're leading.

40:19.817 --> 40:24.020
Well, we've both probably had
enough excitement for a while.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.522
You ready to go?

40:25.524 --> 40:27.690
Yeah.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.860
Oh, um...

40:30.862 --> 40:32.796
Do you know how
this box got here?

40:32.798 --> 40:34.564
No.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.744
Thank you for the last
couple of days.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.947
I'll never forget it.

41:05.896 --> 41:06.896
New car?

41:06.898 --> 41:07.897
No, no.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.899
It's, uh, paige's.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.968
Cabe's dropping her
off from the airport.

41:13.904 --> 41:15.972
Mine keeps on
breaking down.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.243
You know, I'm pretty
low on funds,

41:20.245 --> 41:22.645
What do you say to no more
bailouts for a while?

41:22.647 --> 41:24.614
I'll behave, if, uh...

41:24.616 --> 41:26.483
If you explain this.

41:26.485 --> 41:27.917
Mmm, I don't know
what that is.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.752
You kept this.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.621
All those years?

41:31.623 --> 41:32.922
No, I didn't.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.191
Tokens, talismans,
they're a sign of weakness.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.593
Walter!

41:36.595 --> 41:39.596
I found it in that box.

41:41.565 --> 41:44.834
Okay, uh, when you were 12,

41:44.836 --> 41:46.836
You had a fever.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.271
And there was no hope.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.606
And I just...

41:49.608 --> 41:53.076
I wanted to have
something to remember you.

41:53.078 --> 41:55.612
So...

41:55.614 --> 41:58.515
It bothers me that I keep
that stupid trinket.

42:00.117 --> 42:01.117
It's superstition...

42:01.119 --> 42:02.719
No, it's normal.

42:02.721 --> 42:06.656
But, you know, you're
gonna have to accept

42:06.658 --> 42:09.726
That I'm gonna
leave you someday.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.694
And that day
is coming soon.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.730
No, I refuse accept
that premise.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.599
We've got to enjoy
every moment we can right now.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.635
You know what?

42:20.271 --> 42:21.771
Hey.

42:21.773 --> 42:23.640
We don't need it.
Come on.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.109
I don't want you to keep
memories from when I was sick.

42:26.111 --> 42:28.912
Let's make new ones
while we still can, okay?

42:30.882 --> 42:34.851
Good, now, take me back
to the hospital.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.324
Not yet.

42:45.796 --> 42:47.297
It's beautiful.

42:47.299 --> 42:48.865
Our first new memory.
