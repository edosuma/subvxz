WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.736
The final season of New Girl

00:02.770 --> 00:04.905
celebrates friends to the end.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.807
I'm gonna go open
a bottle of wine.
Pink okay?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.478
And check out
our other Fox shows--

00:10.511 --> 00:12.713
LA to Vegas, Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:12.746 --> 00:14.582
-and The Last Man on Earth.
-(laughs)

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.085 --> 00:20.554
* Who can say where
the road goes *

00:20.588 --> 00:24.392
* Where the day flows *

00:24.425 --> 00:27.561
* Only time *

00:27.595 --> 00:30.598
* And who can say *

00:30.631 --> 00:33.701
* If your love grows *

00:33.734 --> 00:36.604
* As your heart chose... *

00:36.637 --> 00:38.906
Coach said he should make it
in time for the service.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.908
So at least it'll be nice
to see him.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.276
Mm-hmm.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.346
-(sniffles) You okay?
-Yeah.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.916
(sighs)
This is gonna be hard.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.623
I don't know what I would do
if I lost you.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.658
*

01:02.563 --> 01:07.368
* Who can say why
your heart sighs *

01:07.401 --> 01:10.138
* As your love flies *

01:10.171 --> 01:13.407
* Only time *

01:13.441 --> 01:15.576
* And who can say *

01:15.609 --> 01:18.779
* Why your heart cries *

01:18.812 --> 01:21.482
* When your love lies? *

01:21.515 --> 01:24.718
* Only time *

01:24.752 --> 01:28.622
Truly insane, this whole thing.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.658
*

01:36.197 --> 01:37.665
Sorry for the holdup.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.900
Ever since I hit
my third trimester,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.170
I've been having the most
intense gas cramps.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.905
Thank you for coming.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.575
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.278
(clears throat)

01:50.311 --> 01:52.980
It's hard to believe
it's been a whole year

01:53.013 --> 01:54.848
since Furguson's departure.

01:54.882 --> 01:59.253
As you all know from my many
e-mails and a sponsored tweet,

01:59.287 --> 02:01.955
I looked at Furguson as Jewish.

02:01.989 --> 02:06.460
So, in the Jewish tradition,
we unveil his gravestone

02:06.494 --> 02:09.463
on the first anniversary
of his passing.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.003
Furgie accomplished a lot
in his time on Earth--

02:16.036 --> 02:19.807
eating, sleeping,
walking around,

02:19.840 --> 02:21.642
doing that thing with his paw.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.211
You know, where he
licked it a whole bunch?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.478
(chuckles)

02:24.512 --> 02:26.514
Yeah, he lived a full life.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.717
Schmidt, will you begin
the service?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.119
Yit'gadal v'yit'kadash
sh'mei raba.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.555
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.590
*

02:38.326 --> 02:40.228
(indistinct conversations)

02:40.261 --> 02:42.863
Thank you, Hannah.
Good to see you.

02:42.896 --> 02:47.301
Just want to say
I'm so sorry for your loss.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.669
I made a casserole.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.037
Can I have it?

02:50.070 --> 02:52.206
Y-Yeah, that's why I brought it.
Here.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.674
-Mmm.
-You like my shirt?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.709
-It's got cats on it.
-Oh, yeah.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.378
-A lot of cats on there.
-You know how you like

02:57.411 --> 03:00.047
bird shirts, this one has...
this one has cats.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.482
Oh, I actually wear
fish shirts now.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.717
I'm trying so hard, man.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.553
You know, I can't believe
it's been a year.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.188
I mean, Winston's handled this
really well.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.057
Too well.
He hasn't cried once.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.192
He hasn't had the cry yet?

03:12.226 --> 03:13.594
If he doesn't have
the cry today, I'm worried

03:13.627 --> 03:15.396
he's gonna have a full
mental breakdown.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.430
-COACH: Gooby! Gooby! Gooby!
-JESS: Hey, Coach.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.266
So good to see you.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.501
-Good to see you.
-I'm gonna need you to change,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.069
'cause I was really specific
about the dress code

03:22.102 --> 03:23.437
in the invitation.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.038
Could I say hi
to everybody first?

03:25.072 --> 03:26.607
-I don't love it,
but I'll allow it. -Hey, guys!

03:26.640 --> 03:28.676
-Player. Playette!
-Hey.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.111
-Player.
-Hey, Coach.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.381
-Gooby. -WINSTON: Coach,
good to see you, man.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.948
What kind of adult man
wouldn't be here

03:34.982 --> 03:36.016
to support another adult man

03:36.049 --> 03:37.918
a year after his cat died?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.220
Yeah, I thought it was important
to have a memorial.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.955
But you can thank Jess
for everything

03:41.989 --> 03:43.357
looking so amazing.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.092
It was my vision,
but she ran with it.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.628
Well, he was a good cat, he
would have done the same for me.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.962
Maybe after you're finished
with all this,

03:48.996 --> 03:50.130
we can go get you
a replacement cat

03:50.163 --> 03:51.932
to replace, um...

03:51.965 --> 03:53.401
What's, uh, what's his name?
Um...

03:53.434 --> 03:55.436
Cat's name is Furguson,
you friggin' jackass.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.471
Hey, that was so
not under your breath.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.939
-Oh, sorry, I didn't mean
for him to hear. -Anyway,

03:58.972 --> 04:00.808
you know, Furguson was
the only cat for me.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.143
I'd adopt one of those
Peruvian kids for 70 cents a day

04:03.176 --> 04:05.112
-before I adopt another cat.
-(laughter)

04:05.145 --> 04:07.214
I think there's a world
in which you can do both.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.882
Those-those kids need food.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.285
And why rule out another cat?
Furguson's not always

04:11.319 --> 04:12.653
gonna seem irreplaceable.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.087
I mean, it's already been
a year.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.255
Uh, a year?

04:15.289 --> 04:17.725
Is a year a long time to you?

04:17.758 --> 04:18.992
How long would you wait
before you replaced me

04:19.026 --> 04:20.060
if I died?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.462
Okay, this seems like a

04:21.495 --> 04:22.830
"on the ride home"
kind of conversation.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.064
I am not gonna get into this.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.234
'Scuse me,
I'm gonna get into this.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.236
Um, Winston, Aly,
do you want to help me,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.805
um, hand out schedules
for the Furguson tributes?

04:31.839 --> 04:33.140
Um, I kind of just want to sit.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.308
Great, let's go.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.844
Uh, this says 3:20 to 3:40.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.612
I got 20 minutes
to talk about a cat?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.913
Yeah, didn't you read
the e-mail?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.515
We all have 20 minutes
to talk cat.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.116
What a bad friend you are, man.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.151
-What a bad friend.
-You know what?

04:44.184 --> 04:45.519
Keep it up, ham-calves.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.421
You called me "ham-calves"?

04:47.455 --> 04:50.824
-What is going on
with you two?! -BOTH: Nothing.

04:50.858 --> 04:54.227
What did I state clearly
in the program? No beefs.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.199
-Thanks.
-Let me ask you a question.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.267
Uh-huh.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
-We're at my funeral.
-(groans)

05:01.335 --> 05:02.936
"Ka-thunk" goes my coffin.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.438
Shovel dirt, shovel dirt,
shovel dirt.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.974
You wipe the schmutz off
your pretty black dress,

05:07.007 --> 05:09.176
and stopwatch is ticking.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.444
How long do you wait to remarry?

05:10.478 --> 05:11.812
I don't know, three years.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.547
Three years?
Three year...

05:13.581 --> 05:15.215
Not even a full presidential?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.818
Your new husband would still
be finding my bobby pins

05:17.851 --> 05:19.520
in couch cushions.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.889
Uh, h-hello?
Uh, h-hello, everyone.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.458
I am Dunston,
Winston's coworker,

05:24.492 --> 05:27.628
and I have been asked
to officiate this memorial.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.963
-(feedback) -Oops.
Yeah, sorry, sorry about that.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.533
Uh, my hands lose
all strength sometimes.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.802
I take medication for it,
but it makes my mouth dry,

05:34.835 --> 05:36.670
and I wanted to be able to speak
at today's event.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.138
That's why I didn't take it
for the past week.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.139
Also, I ran out.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.741
So I-I guess I'll, uh...

05:40.774 --> 05:43.577
kick things off.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.245
Uh, "Pick up hand strength
medication..."

05:45.278 --> 05:47.548
Oh, that's the wrong
piece of paper.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.649
-Uh...
-Talk about the cat, man.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.817
The cat, the cat, that's right.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.984
JESS:
Would you look at this?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.586
"Furgusson" with two Ss.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.088
The sca-bozos at the bake shop
gunked it up again.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.890
I don't know what's
with everyone today.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.593
Schmidt won't stop asking me
what I'm gonna do when he dies,

05:59.627 --> 06:02.496
Dr. Sam's wearing
a ridiculous shirt,

06:02.530 --> 06:04.031
and Outside Dave is inside.

06:04.064 --> 06:08.569
The sky is so close,
and it's made of wood.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.070
-You know what the real
problem is? -Hmm?

06:10.103 --> 06:11.271
Nick and Coach.
They're at each other

06:11.304 --> 06:13.006
about some stupid thing.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.776
I mean, Coach probably said
something pejorative about

06:15.809 --> 06:17.845
Chicago football's the Bears.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.179
-I don't know.
-Oh, yeah? In your face.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.180
Are you joking?!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.282
-That's it!
-NICK: Really?

06:22.315 --> 06:23.417
-You want to do this?
-Hey!

06:23.451 --> 06:24.952
NICK AND COACH:
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.687
Jess, Jess.
Jess, it's actually hurting.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.689
-Seriously, ow.
-Ow! Watch it.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.223
-I didn't even do anything.
-My arm's swolt.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.459
That just means big.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.360
No, I use it to mean sore.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.262
'Cause "swolt" sounds like
it should be about pain.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.797
-It's onomatopoeia.
-(mocking): "It's onomatopoeia."

06:36.830 --> 06:38.365
-That's not how I said it.
-Shut up.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.568
You shut up. You looked better
a little chunky.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.570
Guys, whatever it is
going on between you two

06:42.603 --> 06:44.104
needs to end now,

06:44.137 --> 06:45.606
so we can go back in there

06:45.639 --> 06:46.974
and celebrate the life of a cat,

06:47.007 --> 06:49.076
who, by the way,
loved you both like sons.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.611
Now, what is it?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.546
Nick, are you mad
'cause Coach said something

06:52.580 --> 06:53.947
bad about wolves?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.549
Coach, are you mad
'cause he still thinks

06:55.583 --> 06:58.418
that the movie should be called
Paul Blop: Mall Cop?

06:58.452 --> 07:00.387
It should be. It's so close
to rhyming perfectly.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.822
They gave up.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.791
Blart is an actual last name.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.893
"Blop" is a sound effect.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.160
I need to get out
of this situation

07:07.194 --> 07:08.228
before I get very angry.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.429
What is it?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.064
(sighs deeply)

07:11.098 --> 07:12.733
I owe him a little money.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.068
Oh, God, I knew it was
something stupid like that.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.838
Coach, pay Nick back.
Nick, forgive Coach.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.306
-(chuckles)
-Or you know what?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.008
I can pay you back.
How much is it?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.143
$71,000.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.279
Huh?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.284
And even though Furguson
walked on short legs,

07:31.318 --> 07:33.587
he stood taller

07:33.621 --> 07:36.156
than any man I have ever known.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.226
(cheering and applause)

07:40.994 --> 07:42.162
Thank you.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.964
-(feedback)
-The hands.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.198
Sorry about that.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.433
Uh, please welcome to the stage

07:46.466 --> 07:47.835
our precinct's a cappella group,

07:47.868 --> 07:50.804
-LAPD So La Ti Do.
-(whoops)

07:50.838 --> 07:53.173
(to tune of "Mad World"):
* All around me *

07:53.206 --> 07:56.143
* Are feline cat faces *

07:56.176 --> 07:58.512
* Warm cat places *

07:58.546 --> 08:00.981
* Whiskered faces... *

08:01.014 --> 08:03.016
-(chuckles)
-Nothing? No?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.485
-Hmm?
-Do you remember these?

08:05.519 --> 08:07.454
* Growing more hair *

08:07.487 --> 08:09.122
* Growing
more hair *

08:09.156 --> 08:12.192
* With ears up top,
they can't wear glasses... *

08:12.225 --> 08:14.895
(laughs)

08:14.928 --> 08:16.730
Furguson's baby teeth.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.399
You know, I remember when he
lost these all in the same day.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.669
Yeah, got into my taffy stash,
he sure did.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.237
Oh, dip,
white chocolate raisins!

08:24.271 --> 08:27.007
-ALY: Oh... -(crunching)
-* No spray bottle... *

08:27.040 --> 08:28.408
(spits)

08:28.441 --> 08:30.343
-Those are cat teeth.
-Cat teeth.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.646
-(gags)
-Cat teeth.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.915
-You can tell cat teeth
by taste? -Yup!

08:34.948 --> 08:38.418
-* Meow, meow, meow, meow *
-* Cat world... *

08:38.451 --> 08:39.987
$71,000?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.990
It happened when I got
my first huge Pepperwood check.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.659
Coach wanted to open up a gym
and-and I wanted to help.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.827
All right, that checks out...

08:46.860 --> 08:49.563
Only it wasn't a gym,
it was a restaurant,

08:49.597 --> 08:53.100
"Coach's Jim." J-I-M.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.335
It was a Ruth's Chris situation.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.937
They went bankrupt
before they even opened.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.238
-My money was gone.
-What?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.707
Coach's Jim?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.441
What kind of cuisine
did they serve?

09:01.474 --> 09:04.111
And who's Jim?
And why did Coach own him?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.013
Anyway, I don't need
to know all of it.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.115
Let's just, let's just
get back to Furguson, okay?

09:08.148 --> 09:11.184
I can't because this feels so
good getting that off my chest.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.020
I need to tell you everything.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.054
No, I don't need
to know everything.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.756
I know, but I want to.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.257
Here's the thing--

09:17.290 --> 09:20.427
this is one that's been bogging
me down for a very long time.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.696
Sometimes I wear my boxers
backwards on purpose

09:22.730 --> 09:24.564
because I really like
the snugness in the front,

09:24.598 --> 09:26.600
but I also really like
the ventilation in the back.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.936
That's right, I'm smushed
like a fat kid's nose

09:28.969 --> 09:30.804
up against the glass
of a candy store window.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.740
(coughs) That felt really good
to get off my chest.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.775
What else? What else? What else?
What else? What else?

09:34.808 --> 09:37.244
What about this scenario?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.279
What if I died jumping
in front of a bullet

09:39.312 --> 09:40.413
with Ruth's name on it?

09:40.447 --> 09:43.150
I know, unthinkable scenario.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.919
But what if? And what if
she's president at the time,

09:45.953 --> 09:49.222
then I've saved the president
and our daughter. Double hero.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.091
You know what? Just pick a
number you're comfortable with.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.394
Okay? a hundred years?
I'd wait a hundred years, okay?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.997
-Not okay. Not long enough.
-Are you kidding me?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.066
We'd both be dead
of natural causes.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.436
Perhaps the correct answer
would be for eternity, forever.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.772
I don't need to know
all of this.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.940
Let's just get back to Furguson,
back to the memorial.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.608
No, Jess, because you
don't keep any secrets,

10:08.642 --> 10:09.743
so I don't want to keep any.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.813
-Well... -Jess, you are
always 100% honest.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.314
So it's important
that I am, too.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.983
-I mean... -No, I want
to tell you everything.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.251
I don't want any skeletons
on our shoulders.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.321
There's one skeleton for me.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.090
-You have a secret?
-Yeah.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.859
-Jessica Day has a secret.
-Don't make fun.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.594
What, did you eat corn on the
cob without the little holders?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.096
It's actually
very emotional for me.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.964
(mocking): Oh, it is? What was
your big lie? Let's hear it.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.432
I killed Furguson.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.669
That's why I've spent
so much time on this memorial.

10:35.703 --> 10:39.439
One year ago,
I killed Winston's cat.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.274
(crowd applauds)

10:41.308 --> 10:44.778
Uh, next up, we have
Nicholas Miller and Jessica Day

10:44.812 --> 10:47.347
coming up to read
a special Furguson poem.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.520
Nick and I will be performing

10:53.553 --> 10:54.654
a series of rhyming couplets

10:54.688 --> 10:56.289
about our friend Furguson.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.827
-(applause, whooping)
-All right!

10:59.860 --> 11:01.729
(clears throat)

11:01.762 --> 11:03.864
Furguson was a good cat,
yes, indeed.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.371
Many cat lessons from his life
you should heed.

11:15.675 --> 11:20.047
With his proud lion mane
and his big fluffy tail...

11:20.080 --> 11:22.049
I mean, you think
you know somebody.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.385
JESS: He ate all his food,
even if it was stale.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.922
Struttin' around with
his smushed little snout.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.993
He loved playing games
and he loved hiding out.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.162
I think I still got teeth
in my teeth.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.265
Like the time that he hid in
the bag we brought burgers in.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.567
I just can't believe
my girlfriend killed Furguson.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.735
(crowd gasps)

11:43.136 --> 11:44.838
Nick.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.506
What? Did I say it?
Did I say the bad thing?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.741
I'm sorry,
it just kind of came out.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.376
(sniffles)

11:49.409 --> 11:50.944
What the man says is true.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.379
A year ago,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.215
I killed a complicated and
beautiful cat named Furguson.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.716
(crowd gasps)

11:56.750 --> 11:58.718
I'm so sorry, Winston.
I didn't know how to tell you.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.853
NICK:
She's not a bad person.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.022
She just did a bad thing.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.556
Don't try to save me, Nick.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.691
(Jess clears throat)

12:04.724 --> 12:06.593
I was catsitting at the loft

12:06.626 --> 12:09.062
and I was doing crafts
that involved glitter.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.564
There was a glitter sale
at Kraftwerk--

12:11.598 --> 12:14.868
the store, not the German band
from the '80s.

12:14.902 --> 12:19.639
And I spilled a bowl of purple,
and Furguson took a bite.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.275
And an hour later,
Winston came to pick him up.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.443
And the next day,

12:23.476 --> 12:25.312
he died.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.980
None of this rhymes.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.983
I did a cat murder!
I'm so sorry.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.418
Aw, Jess, come on.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.455
DUNSTON: Let's, uh,
keep this thing moving.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.391
Next up, we have, uh...
uh, Robby.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
(applause)

12:41.962 --> 12:43.596
Uh...

12:43.630 --> 12:45.565
Well, I was gonna do
an interpretive dance

12:45.598 --> 12:48.936
as the red laser dot
that Furguson loved so much,

12:48.969 --> 12:50.938
but it feels
a little inappropriate

12:50.971 --> 12:53.140
in the current climate. Um...

12:53.173 --> 12:56.276
-I'm so sorry, Winston. -Whoa,
whoa, whoa, Jess, calm down.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.346
I talked to a cat psychic,
she said he's in a good place.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.348
But then she also said
he's with the cat

13:01.381 --> 13:04.351
from Sabrina the Teenage Witch,
and I know that cat's a puppet.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.486
So I don't know
how reliable she is.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.657
I'm just so sorry,
and can you ever forgive me?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.425
Jess, Furguson died
of a heart attack.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.827
-What?
-Yes.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.662
The coroner said nothing
about glitter.

13:15.695 --> 13:16.830
Did you say "coroner"?

13:16.864 --> 13:18.498
Yeah, I had a coroner
check him out.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.133
It was quite possibly
the most bizarre

13:20.167 --> 13:21.835
of my small-time abuses
of police power.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.336
Oh, please let that be true.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.839
My stomach has been
a brick for a year now.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.474
I had to go on probiotics.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.808
Jess, it's true.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.944
I was with Furguson
when he passed.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.345
We were in the kitchen.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.448
-Go on. Tell us. Let it out.
-(sighs)

13:35.482 --> 13:39.552
So there I was,
in the kitchen toasting a bagel.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.389
Furguson was on the counter,
just watching.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.557
You can imagine what
a human toasting a bagel

13:44.591 --> 13:46.860
must look like to a cat:
pretty crazy.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.128
-Really crazy.
-Yeah.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.830
So there he was,
just watching me, you know.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.200
And, um...

13:53.233 --> 13:55.903
And then he got
this look on his face.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.371
And then he stepped back
a little.

13:58.405 --> 14:03.376
And it was in that moment
that I knew something was wrong.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.181
And then he looked away,
and, uh...

14:08.215 --> 14:10.350
And that was it.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.585
He was gone.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.989
I feel like I'm living
this moment.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.991
Oh, and then
the bagel was burning,

14:18.025 --> 14:20.527
so I had to throw that
in the trash.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.694
-(chuckles)
-That didn't get him?

14:21.728 --> 14:22.896
What?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.731
Shh.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.033
(quietly):
You hear that?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.067
Hear what?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.602
I hear a meow.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.704
-You hear a meow?
-Shh!

14:31.738 --> 14:33.673
Oh, God, he's not gonna cry,
he's gonna go insane.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.442
Wait, wait, wait. I-I'm sorry--

14:35.475 --> 14:36.843
I'm hearing something.
I hear a cat,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.445
and it is in distress.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.049
There is a cat in the building,
and it needs me! Meow!

14:44.417 --> 14:46.119
Thank you.
Please don't look over there.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.055
-(Winston meowing) -No reason to
watch a grown man lose his mind.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.522
-Thank you.
-Thanks for having me.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.891
You have
a really beautiful home.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.426
WINSTON:
Meow!

14:53.460 --> 14:56.229
Meow, meow, meow!

14:56.263 --> 14:57.530
Here, kitty cat.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.266
You're a baby covered in hair...

14:59.299 --> 15:01.734
This is the voice I used to use
to make Furguson come to me.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.436
Honey, are you sure
you're hearing a cat?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.038
'Cause, you know,
maybe it's just a little...

15:05.072 --> 15:06.273
-voice in...
-Baby, it's a cat.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.540
Okay? I know a meow
when I hear one.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.076
Guys, can you help us

15:09.109 --> 15:11.644
"look for the cat,"
so I can talk to Winston?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.746
Good call. Jess and I will
check the back office.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.249
Kitty, Kitty, where are you?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.051
Oh, look! Cat poop.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.819
Uh, it's still warm.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.921
-(mouthing) -Do you want
to take a break from looking

15:21.955 --> 15:23.656
-for a fake cat?
-Yes.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.425
I hid something in here
when I used to own the place.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.260
Check this. Aw, it's still here.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.729
-Ah-ha-ha!
-Ah-ha-ha.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.132
Hey, I'm so sorry I lied
about Furguson.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.401
I just... I didn't want you
to look at me differently.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.103
Can I be honest?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.138
I think it's kind of hot
that you kept that as a secret.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.139
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.141
Jessica Day, a murderer?

15:41.174 --> 15:43.676
Keeping murder a secret?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.245
Am I attracted to murderers?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.314
Well, it turns out
I didn't kill him, so...

15:47.347 --> 15:49.582
But if you did,
I want you to know that I'd...

15:49.616 --> 15:50.850
I'd help you bury the body.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.119
You know that, right?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.254
Weirdly, yes, I do.
I do know that.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.289
'Cause it could wake up,
and if it did,

15:56.323 --> 15:58.625
I would just hit it
over the head with a shovel

15:58.658 --> 16:01.461
and then just keep burying it
in the hot desert sand.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.330
Wait, why are we going
all the way out to the desert?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.931
What's wrong with the woods?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.367
Well, only psychos
bury stuff in the woods, Jess.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.203
But listen, the reason I didn't
tell you I lent Coach money was,

16:10.237 --> 16:13.040
I was afraid that one of the
reasons we broke up in the past

16:13.073 --> 16:14.507
was 'cause I was bad at money,

16:14.541 --> 16:16.343
-and I didn't want
to scare you off. -Nick.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.179
Nothing you could do
would scare me off.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.513
We're in this together.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.882
Cat murder and all.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.384
Well, there's nothing
that you could do

16:24.417 --> 16:26.819
that would make me
love you any less.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.356
You know...

16:29.389 --> 16:31.658
you need to fix things
with Coach.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.326
Yeah.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.795
Cat! Where you at?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.365
-Okay, you know what? Here's
my new scenario. -(groans)

16:38.398 --> 16:40.200
-I'm in the Merchant Marines...
-Stop it.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.869
I only blurted out "three years"
because I don't even want

16:42.902 --> 16:44.371
to think about you being gone.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.373
I don't know
what I would do without you.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.176
I would end up dragging
a lawn chair out to your grave

16:49.209 --> 16:51.010
on the Fourth of July
and lighting a sparkler,

16:51.044 --> 16:52.712
and Ruth wouldn't want
to come with me

16:52.745 --> 16:55.415
because she would say
"Mommy, Kevin's having a party,

16:55.448 --> 16:57.717
and I don't want to go
to the grave again."

16:57.750 --> 17:02.155
Okay? So I'm just alone,
on a chair, and I miss you.

17:02.189 --> 17:06.059
I don't want you alone
at my grave.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.928
That sounds terrible.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.699
I want you to be with
your new husband at my grave.

17:12.732 --> 17:16.069
I want you to find someone
who's gonna take care of you,

17:16.103 --> 17:18.105
who's gonna love you
as much as I do.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.540
I just want you.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.709
Well, it's too late for that.
I-I'm dead.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.111
-No. -It's a waste of time.
I might as well be

17:24.144 --> 17:25.778
-at the bottom of the ocean.
-Stop.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.215
You have to move on.
Uh, hey, Dunston.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.882
-Uh... Hey. -Hey,
can you come here for a sec?

17:29.916 --> 17:31.918
-You were great tonight,
by the way. -Oh, thank you.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.553
You did a very good job
under difficult circumstances.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.787
Thank you very much.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.589
So I'm gonna die,

17:36.623 --> 17:39.025
-and I need you to take care
of my wife. -Super.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.693
We're fine. Thank you.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.895
-Okay.
-(laughing): Okay.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.400
Should I join in or just watch?

17:47.434 --> 17:49.769
What exactly are we doing here?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.538
Who wants to begin?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.940
I mean... (sighs) I'm not even
mad about the money.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.542
I'm just mad that Coach and I
never talk anymore.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.144
COACH:
What are you talking about, man?

17:57.177 --> 17:59.246
I called and asked you
if elephants are basically pigs,

17:59.279 --> 18:01.314
and you were like "no,"
and I was like "cool."

18:01.348 --> 18:02.615
Yeah, and that was
an awesome conversation.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.051
It was also
three years ago, man.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.386
We haven't talked since.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.754
I mean, honestly,
I'd pay another

18:07.787 --> 18:10.523
$70,000 to have my friend back.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.127
I feel like we're close.
Let's bring it home.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.429
I guess I just stopped
talking to you

18:16.463 --> 18:17.630
'cause I was embarrassed.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.166
NICK:
Embarrassed with me?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.134
You've seen me trip
after a shower

18:21.168 --> 18:23.803
and rug burn my penis
on a towel.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.772
(laughing):
Classic Nick.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.308
-It really burned.
-It was so scabby.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.177
-NICK: Yeah. -COACH:
It scabbed up like crazy.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.312
-Yes, it did.
-Like a grilled shrimp.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.181
Like grilled jumbo shrimp.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.215
Eh.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.450
I'm gonna pay you back, man.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.918
No matter how long it takes.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.020
I promise.
And to prove it to you,

18:41.053 --> 18:44.424
I... brought $5,000

18:44.457 --> 18:45.925
as your first installment.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.627
You brought it in cash?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.197
Why is everyone so cavalier
about large sums of money?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.965
You just dropped, like, $600.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.434
I can hear him.
Don't worry, cat.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.668
I'm coming to save you.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.838
ALY:
Winston, Winston! Stop it. Babe.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.473
Babe, sit down,
sit down. Winston.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.709
Baby, I love you,

19:02.742 --> 19:04.844
but these meows
are in your head.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.480
Okay? It's because you haven't
cried over Furguson yet,

19:07.514 --> 19:09.282
and not letting yourself
have a good cry

19:09.316 --> 19:11.184
has made you a little doy-doy.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.185
You know...

19:12.219 --> 19:13.720
(strumming lips)

19:13.753 --> 19:15.555
It's made you really dumb

19:15.588 --> 19:17.790
and stupid,
and you're not those things.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.227
Now is the time
to let it all out.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.528
Right now, Winston.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.129
You don't have to try
to be strong for me.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.665
(crying)

19:25.698 --> 19:28.535
Wow, those sinuses
swelled up fast.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.936
(screaming)

19:31.938 --> 19:34.073
My cat, my cat, my cat.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.042
You know,
it didn't hit me at first,

19:36.075 --> 19:38.077
and then,
by the time that it did,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.547
you were already pregnant,
and I just wanted to be...

19:40.580 --> 19:43.550
I wanted to be the rock
for this family.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.552
Baby, if there's one thing
I know for sure,

19:45.585 --> 19:47.654
it's that I'm the rock
in this family.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.357
Yeah, but if you're the rock,
then what am I?

19:50.390 --> 19:54.427
You're the beautiful flower
sprouting out from the rock.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.896
-I like flowers, so...
-I know you do, buddy.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.030
-WINSTON: Yeah.
-Oh, buddy.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.366
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, buddy.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.000
-Hey, buddy. -Hey, buddy.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.703
Oh, I like it when y'all call me
"buddy." It's nice.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.339
Also, you can stop
looking for the cat.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.008
I don't want to blow you guys'
minds, but, uh...

20:09.041 --> 20:10.377
it ain't real.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.544
SCHMIDT:
What?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.413
The cat isn't real?

20:13.446 --> 20:15.248
That's a...

20:15.282 --> 20:17.717
This is all so Shyamalanian.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.218
I guess I just been
keeping things bottled up

20:19.252 --> 20:20.587
-a little too tight.
-(cat meowing)

20:20.620 --> 20:21.921
Shh. Okay,

20:21.954 --> 20:23.856
I can't even believe
I'm saying this,

20:23.890 --> 20:25.725
but I think I hear a cat.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.460
Come on, now.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.396
No, I'm serious. Listen.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.763
(meowing)

20:30.797 --> 20:32.465
Well, I did not see that coming.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.800
SCHMIDT:
It's coming from the couch.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.802
(meowing)

20:38.405 --> 20:40.006
-(gasps)
-Aw.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.511
(meows)

20:46.012 --> 20:47.947
Oh, my God,

20:47.980 --> 20:49.215
he's scared.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.317
Man, don't be scared.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.618
He loves you.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.221
Yeah, I'm here, okay?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.490
Baby, he's not wearing any tags.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.891
Which means he's a stray.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.893
-Can we...?
-Okay, yes,

21:00.927 --> 21:02.795
but only if you feed him
from one of those bottles

21:02.829 --> 21:04.964
like in a zoo documentary,
'cause I like that,

21:04.997 --> 21:06.333
that's cute as hell.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.100
(laughs)

21:08.134 --> 21:10.303
Hey.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.772
-You found my cat.
-Well...

21:12.805 --> 21:15.942
Oh, that's
the bartender's bar cat.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.444
I'm sorry, but, uh,
that cat's gone.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.278
-Give me my cat back.
-JESS: Wait.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.982
Um, what if we were to offer you

21:23.015 --> 21:25.852
$5,000 in cash for the cat?

21:25.885 --> 21:26.986
Oh, yeah, then, totally.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.355
That'd be fine.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.690
$5,000. Curious,
what's the lowest amount

21:30.723 --> 21:32.191
you would have taken
for that cat?

21:32.224 --> 21:35.428
I don't know,
maybe, like, uh, 50 bucks?

21:35.462 --> 21:36.796
-$50.
-Yeah.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.998
-That's considerably less
than $5,000. -Oh, yeah.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.199
Here you go.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.968
I think I'm gonna name him...

21:42.001 --> 21:44.537
-NAFTA. -ALL: Aw!
-I don't like it.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.539
His name's actually Mitzi.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.675
ALL:
NAFTA!

21:48.708 --> 21:51.143
(laughter)

21:51.177 --> 21:52.144

21:52.178 --> 21:54.146

done hanging

22:00.252 --> 22:03.189
here are a few more shows
