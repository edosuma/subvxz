My name is Michael Westen.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.573
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.639 --> 00:07.975
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.042 --> 00:10.444
[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're burned,
you've got nothing--

00:10.511 --> 00:13.114
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.417
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.086
Miami.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.788
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.557
- You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.624 --> 00:26.494
- a trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.560 --> 00:29.330
an old friend
who used to inform on you
to the F.B.I.--

00:29.397 --> 00:31.632
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.068
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.437
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

00:36.504 --> 00:40.774
Bottom line:
As long as you're burned,
you're not going anywhere.

[ Michael Narrating ]
When you prepare for a mission,

00:51.485 --> 00:53.554
it's the little things
that count.

00:53.621 --> 00:57.325
Firepower is great,
but an operation's more likely
to be saved...

00:57.391 --> 00:59.627
by a fresh set of batteries
than a gun.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.130
"Bring a camera"?
That's all he'd tell you
about this gig?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.731
Strickler plays it
close to the vest.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.667
And you're just going
right along with it.
I don't have much choice.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.171
If I want my old job back,
he's the guy that can
make it happen.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.773
The fact that he's a weasel
doesn't give you pause?

01:12.840 --> 01:16.009
Fi, right now he's the only
dance partner I have.
You know what I mean.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.812
He's my ticket back in, Fi.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.548
[ Knocking ]

01:35.729 --> 01:38.632
- Fiona Glenanne.
Always a pleasure.
- The pleasure's all yours.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.637
Okay. Well, I'd love to
stay and chat, but Michael and I
have work to do.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.540
Ready to go, Michael?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.143
Hey. Michael.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.679
I know how much
this job means to you,

01:51.745 --> 01:55.115
but if it doesn't
feel right, promise me
you'll walk away.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.286
Fi, I have to go.

02:08.061 --> 02:11.399
I sense you're not
entirely comfortable with
this arrangement, Michael.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.434
So I just want to remind you
what's at stake.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.838
You do this, and you have
my word the powers that be
will review your burn notice.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.073
Your word?
Laugh if you like,

02:20.140 --> 02:23.677
but I wouldn't be driving
an Aston Martin if I didn't know
how to keep a promise.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.180
- You'll get your call
from Washington.
- Tell me about the job.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.150
That is a safe house
for an American
intelligence agency,

02:30.218 --> 02:32.820
and they use it
to store weapons
for missions abroad.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.557
Now, what if I told you
I know the exact moment
it's left unguarded?

02:36.624 --> 02:40.261
Don't worry.
I'm not asking you
to steal them.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.796
Somebody's already
taking care of that.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.366
Got word that thieves
were ripping off a stash
of military equipment.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.167
We should alert the owners.

02:47.235 --> 02:50.037
[ Strickler ]
Oh, we will.
But timing is everything.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.407
Now, I paid a hefty sum
to learn that they're selling
the stuff on Friday,

02:53.474 --> 02:55.476
but nobody knows
the buyer or the location.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.978
That's where you come in,
superstar.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.047
The crew has a cleaner.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.115
Ding, ding, ding!
Give this man a prize.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.917
He's the key
to tracking the sale.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.788
I'm no ace operative,
but I'd say a picture of his
license plate would be helpful.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.424
[ Michael Narrating ]
Heists are like parties.

03:10.491 --> 03:14.795
The worst part is cleaning up.
Someone has to stay behind
to get rid of all the evidence.

03:17.631 --> 03:22.803
Of course, tidying up after
a heist often involves methods
not suitable for parties.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.414
Moment of truth, Michael.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.428
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Groans ]

03:47.495 --> 03:49.563
You going somewhere?
Yep.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.665
Going out with Miss Reynolds.
Got new underwear
and everything.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.935
[ Chuckles ] Buddy of mine's
gonna loan me his villa.

03:55.002 --> 03:59.239
Got a full bar, hot tub with
a 14-jet water massage system.

03:59.307 --> 04:03.311
Nice. Any luck running that
license plate for me with
your cop buddies?

04:03.377 --> 04:05.245
Yeah. But, Mike, I mean,
come on.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.481
Are you really working
with Strickler?
The guy's a parasite.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.084
He can help clear my name.
I don't get to be choosy.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.488
Uh-huh. Anyway, look.
The car was rented
with a stolen Visa,

04:14.555 --> 04:16.656
so that's no surprise,
but get this:

04:16.724 --> 04:19.793
Same card bought gas three times
in a neighborhood in Doral.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.928
And?
Well, the only place
out there...

04:21.995 --> 04:25.566
that doesn't ask for I.D. when
you check in is the Wages Motel.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.035
So, I'll bet you a minty mojito
that's where he's hiding out.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.639
Great work, Sam.
I need to get eyes on it
before he makes a move.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.275
Hold your horses there, cowboy.
The motel is right across
the street from a bingo parlor.

04:35.343 --> 04:39.447
You're not gonna blend in with
the senior citizens, so we gotta
set up some kind of...

04:39.513 --> 04:41.148
rotating surveillance
in a storefront down the street.

04:41.214 --> 04:44.084
Oh. Do me a favor. Uh, that
kind of wrecks the top of 'em.

04:44.151 --> 04:47.788
Just a little fold is good.
Do you have a better idea?

04:47.855 --> 04:50.424
Look. Don't shut me down
right away, Mike,

04:50.491 --> 04:54.395
but I'm thinking this could
work better if we had someone
who could blend in with bingo.

04:54.462 --> 04:58.832
Somebody we trust.
Someone close to home.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.034
You talking about my mom?
Look. It's only a watching job,

05:01.101 --> 05:03.437
so there's gonna be
other people around.
She should be fine.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.540
I'll talk to her.
Oh. Uh, yeah. About that.

05:06.607 --> 05:11.144
I should mention. Um,
she's been a little out of sorts
since the roof started leaking.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.246
Leaking?
How bad we talking?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.215
Uh, pretty bad.
For some crazy reason,

05:15.282 --> 05:18.786
she thinks it has to do with
the time I blew up the house.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.190
Strictly need to know, Mike.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.058
Anyway, Fi's in there
helping clean up.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.599
Will there be any shooting?
No, Mom. No shooting.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.534
All you'll be doing
is watching.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.769

Damn it! See?

05:38.238 --> 05:40.808
Every time it rains,
I'm telling you,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.843
this place turns into
Noah's ark.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.978
Mom, I'll fix the roof.
I need your help.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.085
Fine. It'll be good
to get out of the house.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.255
I'll get my purse.

05:55.322 --> 05:59.660
Really, Michael, it's one thing
for you to do this job,
but involving your mom--

05:59.727 --> 06:01.829
I'm just adapting to the needs
of the operation, Fi.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.999

[ Cell Phone Rings ]

Thank God.

It's Barry. Look.
Um, you know all those
favors you owe me?

06:13.474 --> 06:16.577
- I'm calling in all of them.
- Barr, I'm right in the middle
of something.

06:16.644 --> 06:22.249
I'm at the Carlito.
And bring Fiona, 'cause this
could get a little violent.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.117
Yeah, I'll be right there.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.726
- What's going on, Barry?
- Someone stole my ledger, Mike.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.497
The list of my clients
and all the accounts
where I, uh,

06:36.564 --> 06:38.666
protect their money.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.401
So, what, it's like a little
black book for money launderers?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.437
Yeah. Only instead of
blondes named Chloe,

06:43.504 --> 06:47.508
I got a bunch of angry rich guys
who are gonna dismember me
when they find out it's gone.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.376
You keep that all written down
in one place?

06:49.443 --> 06:51.311
Yeah, I know.
It's part of my sales pitch.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.414
You keep data on a computer,
it's like open season
for hackers and the I.R.S.,

06:54.482 --> 06:56.884
so I run things
old-school, you know.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.219
Anyway, I got a phone call
this morning.

06:59.286 --> 07:03.223
This new friend.
He wants five million
by Thursday,

07:03.290 --> 07:04.992
or he's gonna
sell the ledger.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.496
And if somebody starts
blackmailing my clients,
it's like--

07:08.562 --> 07:11.198

make me beg?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.871
I say beg.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.808
We're not gonna make you beg.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.747
Any idea who's behind this?

07:26.814 --> 07:29.850
I kept the ledger in a private
storage space that I took out
under an alias.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.385
- Well, could someone
have followed you to it?
- Uh-uh. No.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.022
When I go there, I keep, like,
an eye over both shoulders,
like, simultaneously.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.758
Was anything else
in your storage space,
besides the ledger?

07:37.825 --> 07:41.895
No. It was just the ledger,
some cash and a little paperwork
Amy asked me to hold on to.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.232
- Amy?
- A girlfriend. Yeah. We're
going on three months now.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.102
This scumbag stole her will
and the deed to her house.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.672
She's gonna be pissed,
and when Amy gets pissed,
ouch.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.340
Barry, you ever hear
of a Trojan horse?

07:53.406 --> 07:56.844
You put a tracker
on a document, you give it
to someone to hide, and--

07:56.910 --> 07:59.079
You follow the signal
back to the hiding place.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.249
- Tracker on the documents?
Jesus. They can do that?
- It's standard technique.

08:02.315 --> 08:07.187
No. No, no, no.
That's impossible. Amy's in
Atlanta taking care of her aunt.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.657
She was out of town
the same week
that the ledger disappeared?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.792

Anyone trained in
countersurveillance knows...

08:25.405 --> 08:29.442
most field ops are between 22,
when people finish training,

08:29.509 --> 08:31.712
and 55, when they retire,

08:31.779 --> 08:34.214

even wary operatives...

don't usually pay attention
to kids or anyone
on Social Security.

How's that? Casual enough?
[ Sam On Earpiece ]
It's just fine, Maddy.

playing bingo. Just think of
this as a normal afternoon.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.929
Go see your son.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.132
[ Tires Squeal ]

34:30.768 --> 34:34.440
[ Michael Narrating ]
Anybody with training can
detect a tail from a single car.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.007
We need new transportation.
Let's go.

34:37.074 --> 34:41.045
Pros watch for anyone
who makes the same turns
or runs too many yellow lights.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.449
To beat a pro, then,
you need a team.

34:45.016 --> 34:49.255
It's best to start a tail midway
along your target's route,

34:49.321 --> 34:51.157
when they're sure
no one's following.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.525
To do that, you need
someone down the road
to give you a heads-up.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.663
Yeah. She just turned down
Sherman Way.
[ Michael ] Nice work, Barry.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.677
- Fi, you wanna go in
for a closer look?
- I'm on it.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.712
[ Michael Narrating ]
Once you have eyes
on the target,

35:13.779 --> 35:16.648
it's just a matter of
handing off surveillance
at regular intervals.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.658
Hey, Mikey! Ain't she grand?

35:26.725 --> 35:28.827
Turn it loose, Sam.

35:30.829 --> 35:34.600
Hang behind your target
too long, and they'll wonder
why you're not passing.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.370
Best way to avoid
their suspicion, pass them.

35:41.307 --> 35:44.210
[ Sam ]
She's turning into
South Pointe Park.

35:54.820 --> 35:58.624
What is she waitin' for?
It's been a half hour.
Fi, you see anything?

35:58.690 --> 36:02.294
[ Sighs ]
Just some street vendors and
a few tourists with back hair.

36:02.361 --> 36:06.164
Hold on a second, Michael.
That's the third time
I've seen the bike guy.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.647
The guy on the bike
just dropped something.

36:25.083 --> 36:28.220
[ Fiona ]
They just exchanged keys.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.060
Fi, what's biker doing
behind the palm trees?

36:35.126 --> 36:37.229
[ Fiona ]
Beach lockers.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.965
He's got the ledger.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.236
Fi, I'm going after the buyer.
Take Natalie.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.605
Oh. With pleasure.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.747
Ow!
[ Groans ]

36:55.814 --> 36:57.983
- Don't hurt me. I just--
- We don't care about you.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.218
We just want this.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.327
Hello again.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.662
- [ Groans ]
- It's over, Natalie.

37:10.729 --> 37:14.300
You know what? Natalie's
just a name on a passport.

37:14.366 --> 37:15.901
Whatever your name is,
you lose.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.536
Oop.

37:19.104 --> 37:22.207
I always tell my buyers
to put two things
in the trunk:

37:22.274 --> 37:24.376
duffel full of cash...

37:24.443 --> 37:26.144
and a gun
full of bullets.

37:26.211 --> 37:30.015
You were so sweet
about Jared,

37:30.081 --> 37:33.385
or whatever his name was,
'cause that was just a picture
in a key chain.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.821
Now, I know that
you are not the type...

37:35.887 --> 37:39.157
to shoot into a crowd
of little kids,

37:39.224 --> 37:42.528
but I am.
[ Woman ]
Stay together.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.096
You're leaving
without your cash?
You take one step...

37:45.163 --> 37:47.232
towards me,
I'll drop one.

37:47.299 --> 37:50.436
You have my word.
See you around.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.572
Count on it.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.485
So,

38:06.552 --> 38:08.420
the cops find a car
full of dirty cash,

38:08.487 --> 38:11.890
and the people who wanted
my ledger get shafted
for five million?

38:11.957 --> 38:14.192
It's beautiful.
Sam called Immigration,

38:14.259 --> 38:16.462
and Milovan's being deported.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.730
And Natalie--
she just vanished?
Well, she's smart.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.400
She won't be returning
anytime soon.
Well,

38:21.467 --> 38:24.269
this clears the tab
on all the debts you owe me.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.505
Thank you.
You ducked a lot
of phone calls.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.707
What are you gonna
tell your clients?

38:28.774 --> 38:31.410
Your mom hooked me up
with a cover story.
I've been purifying...

38:31.477 --> 38:33.512
in an ashram.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.514
No carbs, no e-mail,
no phone.

38:35.581 --> 38:38.183
- Nice, Mom.
- Thanks, Mrs. Westen.

38:38.249 --> 38:41.453
And hey, let me know
how it works out
with my roof repair guy.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.589
Bye, Barry.
See ya.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.927
[ Sighs ]
Michael,

38:48.994 --> 38:52.063
how did that business
with the hotel cleaner
turn out?

38:52.130 --> 38:56.502
Fi and I are finishing that
tomorrow. We couldn't have
done it without you, Mom.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.739
Well, maybe one day you'll tell
me what it was really about.

39:01.773 --> 39:05.577
But, um, no need to
go into it tonight.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.524
[ Door Opens ]

39:20.959 --> 39:24.396
I thought you were gonna go
as a sunbather.

39:24.463 --> 39:28.600
Michael, I--
I know I said that I would
go along with you on this job,

39:28.667 --> 39:31.236
but I don't want you
to work with Strickler.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.440
Not now. Not ever.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.675
I can't help you with this.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.077
It's a two-person job.
I need you.

39:39.144 --> 39:43.615
[ Beeps, Shutter Clicks ]
I've seen the site.
You can handle yourself.

39:43.682 --> 39:46.151
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried about you.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.521
Working with someone
like Strickler-- it changes
you little by little.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.891
He's the only one
who can get me back in.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.862
What do you want me to do?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.669
You do what you have to do.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.938
I understand.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.943
I just can't stay here
in Miami and watch.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.445

Inside. Keep going.

[ Michael Narrating ]
There's no greater luxury
in the field...

40:32.063 --> 40:34.065
than working with a friend
you rely on.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.035
When you find someone
you can trust absolutely,

40:37.102 --> 40:39.471
you want them on
every operation you do.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.573
[ Beeps, Shutter Clicks ]

40:41.640 --> 40:43.709
[ Shutter Clicking ]

40:43.775 --> 40:44.810
Yeah.

40:50.115 --> 40:54.119
And nothing hurts worse
than losing a friend
to bullets, politics...

40:54.185 --> 40:56.588
or something personal.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.996
But when you have to
work alone again,

41:05.063 --> 41:07.899
you lock those feelings away
and do the job at hand.

- [ Shutter Clicking ]
- [ Engine Starts ]

41:10.736 --> 41:13.038

41:16.241 --> 41:18.276
Because,
as every spy knows,

41:18.343 --> 41:22.180
there's plenty of time
to think about what you've lost
after the mission is over.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.856
Did you shoot these
with a tripod?

41:30.922 --> 41:34.960
I mean, look at that photo.
I should put you up for a job
with National Geographic.

41:35.026 --> 41:38.363
What happened to those men
who drove away
with the military equipment?

41:38.429 --> 41:41.667
Gee, I don't know.
I hope one day
they're brought to justice.

who are they for?
