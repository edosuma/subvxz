WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:02.812
He was an artist

00:02.814 --> 00:05.191
whose paintings have become
priceless masterpieces.

00:05.192 --> 00:07.401
Leonardo
produced some of the world's

00:07.402 --> 00:08.736
most recognizable paintings...

00:08.737 --> 00:10.363
The Mona Lisa, the Last Supper,

00:10.364 --> 00:12.031
the Lady with an Ermine.

00:12.032 --> 00:14.075
He was a genius

00:14.076 --> 00:17.411
whose inventions were centuries
ahead of their time.

00:17.412 --> 00:19.580
He drew construction plans

00:19.581 --> 00:22.208
for tanks, for helicopters,

00:22.209 --> 00:27.004
all sorts of wild things
that came into reality

00:27.005 --> 00:29.590
during our lifetime, right now.

00:29.591 --> 00:31.592
But there are those who believe

00:31.593 --> 00:34.136
that Leonardo da Vinci
was inspired

00:34.137 --> 00:37.265
by an extraterrestrial
intelligence,

00:37.266 --> 00:41.435
that his paintings are embedded
with secret knowledge

00:41.436 --> 00:44.814
and contain codes which,
when deciphered,

00:44.815 --> 00:48.067
will provide the keys
to unlocking the universe.

00:48.068 --> 00:50.778
I think
da Vinci is trying to tell us

00:50.779 --> 00:53.239
that there's
a higher intelligence

00:53.240 --> 00:54.783
that operates in our world.

01:23.312 --> 01:26.188
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

01:26.189 --> 01:29.358
we move to the Leonardo
da Vinci, the Salvator Mundi,

01:29.359 --> 01:31.527
the masterpiece by Leonardo
of Christ the Savior,

01:31.528 --> 01:34.405
previously in the collections
of three kings of England.

01:34.406 --> 01:35.865
New York City.

01:35.866 --> 01:39.368
November 15, 2017.

01:39.369 --> 01:42.288
$370 million.
Back to Francoise's clients...

01:42.289 --> 01:45.583
at $370 million dollars,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:45.584 --> 01:46.834
400.

01:46.835 --> 01:48.669
$400 million!

01:48.670 --> 01:51.756
At a Christie's auction
at Rockefeller Center,

01:51.757 --> 01:55.176
Leonardo da Vinci's
newly authenticated painting

01:55.177 --> 01:56.677
Salvator Mundi

01:56.678 --> 02:00.514
sells for a record-breaking
$400 million.

02:00.515 --> 02:04.352
- Sold.
- The buyer is a Saudi prince,

02:04.353 --> 02:08.439
representing the new
Louvre museum in Abu Dhabi.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.610
But why was a member
of the Saudi royal family...

02:12.611 --> 02:16.530
Or anyone... so willing to pay
such an incredible price

02:16.531 --> 02:18.325
for a work of art?

02:20.869 --> 02:23.662
Leonardo da Vinci
has captured the fascination

02:23.663 --> 02:25.414
of so many people.

02:25.415 --> 02:28.959
I really believe he was
way ahead of his time.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.254
But if Leonardo were alive today
and realized

02:32.255 --> 02:35.299
how much his paintings
would go for, he'd go crazy.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.551
It's a lot of money
for a painting.

02:37.552 --> 02:40.429
You ask yourself
if there's another possibility.

02:40.430 --> 02:44.183
There are those who believe
that the Salvator Mundi

02:44.184 --> 02:48.187
is much more than a priceless
piece of Renaissance art.

02:48.188 --> 02:51.065
They believe,
when considered in context

02:51.066 --> 02:54.151
with other examples
of da Vinci's paintings,

02:54.152 --> 02:57.196
that it contains a piece
of a giant puzzle,

02:57.197 --> 02:59.615
one that, when put together,

02:59.616 --> 03:02.869
could reveal
the secrets of the universe.

03:06.915 --> 03:10.501
April 15, 1452.

03:10.502 --> 03:13.504
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci,

03:13.505 --> 03:15.506
the illegitimate child

03:15.507 --> 03:20.010
of a nobleman and his maid,
is born in Vinci, Italy.

03:20.011 --> 03:22.972
If you were not entitled
to take your father's name,

03:22.973 --> 03:25.766
your last name just became
the town you came from.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.936
This probably aided
his development.

03:28.937 --> 03:30.938
The fact that he didn't belong

03:30.939 --> 03:33.149
also meant
that he wasn't caught up

03:33.150 --> 03:35.568
in the official version
of reality.

03:35.569 --> 03:39.906
He was free enough
to have his own ideas.

03:41.616 --> 03:43.617
When he was a teenager,

03:43.618 --> 03:46.954
Leonardo settled
in nearby Florence.

03:46.955 --> 03:51.375
At that time,
the city was a cultural mecca,

03:51.376 --> 03:54.628
the beating heart
of a classical revival

03:54.629 --> 03:56.630
known as the Renaissance.

03:56.631 --> 03:58.632
The Renaissance is a resurgence

03:58.633 --> 04:01.969
of new ideas and approaches
and interests

04:01.970 --> 04:03.971
in not only antiquity

04:03.972 --> 04:07.516
but in the reinterpretation
of the human condition.

04:07.517 --> 04:11.062
It reinvents, really,
the culture of the time.

04:13.607 --> 04:17.192
Leonardo received
an informal education

04:17.194 --> 04:19.904
in the studio of the renowned
Florentine painter

04:19.904 --> 04:22.156
Andrea del Verrocchio,

04:22.157 --> 04:25.117
but was also
largely self-taught.

04:25.118 --> 04:28.954
Despite this... Or
perhaps because of it...

04:28.955 --> 04:33.042
He excelled at a staggering
range of disciplines.

04:33.043 --> 04:36.337
Da Vinci was
way ahead of his time

04:36.338 --> 04:39.006
during the period
in which he lived.

04:39.007 --> 04:43.427
He drew construction plans
for tanks...

04:43.428 --> 04:47.723
for helicopters,
all sorts of wild things

04:47.724 --> 04:49.600
that came into reality

04:49.601 --> 04:53.813
during our lifetime, right now.

04:55.106 --> 04:57.525
In March 2018,

04:57.526 --> 05:00.528
author and ancient astronaut
theorist William Henry

05:00.529 --> 05:02.613
traveled to Florence
to learn more

05:02.614 --> 05:04.657
about the Renaissance master.

05:04.658 --> 05:07.409
He was also eager
to find out, firsthand,

05:07.410 --> 05:10.246
if there was any truth
to the theory

05:10.247 --> 05:14.500
that da Vinci hid secret
messages in his paintings.

05:14.501 --> 05:18.128
At the Piazzale Michelangelo,
overlooking the city,

05:18.129 --> 05:21.215
Henry met
with Dr. Michael Kwakkelstein,

05:21.216 --> 05:23.717
who has made it
his life's work to discover

05:23.718 --> 05:26.887
everything there is to know
about Leonardo da Vinci.

05:26.888 --> 05:30.599
I'm so excited to be here
in Florence, home of Leonardo.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.476
Yeah, you look around,
you start to see

05:32.477 --> 05:34.478
that these are what you see
in Leonardo's paintings.

05:34.479 --> 05:36.689
Absolutely.
He took his inspiration

05:36.690 --> 05:39.191
just from those hills,
those trees.

05:39.192 --> 05:42.236
500 years ago, Florence was,
of course, a much smaller city.

05:42.237 --> 05:43.487
- Right.
- So just crossing the Arno

05:43.488 --> 05:45.739
over there,
you see the Ponte Vecchio,

05:45.740 --> 05:49.034
Yes. -Leonardo would find
himself amidst nature

05:49.035 --> 05:51.704
to study the fall of water
or the movement of water,

05:51.705 --> 05:53.789
- to study birds.
- Leonardo created

05:53.790 --> 05:56.333
just a prodigious volume of...

05:56.334 --> 05:58.586
an explosion, really,
of creativity.

05:58.587 --> 06:00.796
What do we have left
of his legacy?

06:00.797 --> 06:03.591
Do we have a lot? A little?

06:03.592 --> 06:05.384
Well, we have a dozen paintings.

06:05.385 --> 06:07.261
Some of these paintings
are unfinished.

06:07.262 --> 06:09.972
Some of these paintings are
in a bad state.

06:09.973 --> 06:12.099
Uh, but we have his notebooks,

06:12.100 --> 06:13.767
his manuscripts...
It's like a map

06:13.768 --> 06:16.228
- of his mind, all these writings.
- Wow.

06:16.229 --> 06:18.522
You've personally been able
to explore those notebooks

06:18.523 --> 06:20.608
- and spent your life...
- I'm still working on it.

06:20.609 --> 06:22.444
It's a life work.

06:24.654 --> 06:27.448
But while Leonardo's genius

06:27.449 --> 06:30.367
was highly regarded
in his lifetime,

06:30.368 --> 06:34.622
he was also highly scrutinized
by the Roman Catholic Church,

06:34.623 --> 06:37.458
which remained
a powerful political force

06:37.459 --> 06:39.501
throughout Italy
and much of the world.

06:39.502 --> 06:42.963
During the Renaissance,
there was a rediscovery

06:42.964 --> 06:47.384
of ancient classical documents
that were stored in monasteries

06:47.385 --> 06:50.346
after the dissolution
of the Roman Empire.

06:50.347 --> 06:52.306
Because of these
new discoveries,

06:52.307 --> 06:54.141
new ideas were circulating,

06:54.142 --> 06:57.144
ideas from great minds
like Plato,

06:57.145 --> 06:59.813
Aristotle and Galen
from the ancient world.

06:59.814 --> 07:01.815
But these great ideas

07:01.816 --> 07:05.778
often did not combine well
with Christianity,

07:05.779 --> 07:10.658
and Leonardo is someone who
represents a point of conflict.

07:10.659 --> 07:13.410
It is this ancient knowledge

07:13.411 --> 07:16.830
that has led many scholars
and ancient astronaut theorists

07:16.831 --> 07:19.667
to suggest that da Vinci,
while Christian,

07:19.668 --> 07:23.963
was also open to a wide range
of spiritual philosophies.

07:25.173 --> 07:27.216
Philosophies which, if revealed,

07:27.217 --> 07:29.385
would have placed him
in opposition

07:29.386 --> 07:32.513
to the strict teachings
of the Catholic Church,

07:32.514 --> 07:36.476
and would have caused him to be
publicly shunned as a heretic.

07:37.519 --> 07:38.936
It's almost certain

07:38.937 --> 07:41.939
that Leonardo had access
to secret knowledge.

07:41.940 --> 07:45.609
Leonardo was actually not,
as a lot of people think today,

07:45.610 --> 07:47.736
some kind of atheist.

07:47.737 --> 07:50.364
Leonardo was a heretic.

07:50.365 --> 07:53.450
He passionately believed

07:53.451 --> 07:57.579
in something that was outside
of the mainstream religion,

07:57.580 --> 07:59.874
and therefore very dangerous.

08:01.793 --> 08:05.379
Florence, Italy. 2002.

08:05.380 --> 08:08.882
Using infrared
diagnostic techniques,

08:08.883 --> 08:12.386
Dr. Maurizio Seracini uncovers
the underdrawing,

08:12.387 --> 08:14.513
or preliminary sketch,

08:14.514 --> 08:17.474
done by Leonardo da Vinci
for his unfinished painting

08:17.475 --> 08:19.728
Adoration of the Magi.

08:20.979 --> 08:23.522
Commissioned in 1481,

08:23.523 --> 08:25.816
the work depicts
the biblical story

08:25.817 --> 08:30.904
of the three wise men visiting
the infant Jesus in Bethlehem.

08:30.905 --> 08:33.741
But by viewing the painting
with this new technology,

08:33.741 --> 08:37.578
it becomes apparent
that Leonardo's original sketch

08:37.578 --> 08:40.164
actually included
many more details

08:40.164 --> 08:43.835
than those that could be seen
with just the naked eye.

08:45.211 --> 08:47.838
The first time
I aimed the camera,

08:47.839 --> 08:51.592
the infrared camera,
to the, uh, to the Adoration,

08:51.593 --> 08:55.095
uh... I felt very privileged.

08:55.096 --> 08:58.640
Because for the first time
in 500 years,

08:58.641 --> 09:03.145
I managed to see probably
the best creativity effort

09:03.146 --> 09:06.398
of Leonardo on a work of art.

09:06.399 --> 09:08.859
And science can help you
to go back,

09:08.860 --> 09:11.487
like if you were
in a time machine,

09:11.488 --> 09:15.032
and I saw dozens of figures...

09:15.033 --> 09:20.120
Fighting horses, uh...
nature, architecture.

09:20.121 --> 09:22.956
And now my eyes alone
could not see them,

09:22.957 --> 09:24.792
because they were covered

09:24.793 --> 09:29.254
by a brownish monochrome
layer of paint...

09:29.255 --> 09:31.465
that later I understood

09:31.466 --> 09:33.802
was not applied by Leonardo.

09:35.053 --> 09:37.721
In the background
of the top left,

09:37.722 --> 09:40.891
you could see a couple of people

09:40.892 --> 09:45.562
sitting in despair
on stairs of a temple in ruins.

09:45.563 --> 09:48.899
Well, aiming the camera
at the scene,

09:48.900 --> 09:52.821
then suddenly a completely
different view came out.

09:53.822 --> 09:56.156
The detail that was painted over

09:56.157 --> 09:59.076
was a scene of a pagan temple

09:59.077 --> 10:03.163
that was rising up through
the ruins of a Christian church.

10:03.164 --> 10:05.707
And this
was considered problematic

10:05.708 --> 10:08.836
during the Renaissance period
with Christianity

10:08.837 --> 10:10.921
as the one and only
true religion.

10:10.922 --> 10:15.384
Upon close examination
of da Vinci's original sketch,

10:15.385 --> 10:17.678
instead of a temple in ruins,

10:17.679 --> 10:20.472
the artist seemed
to be depicting a scenario

10:20.473 --> 10:23.810
in which an Egyptian temple
is being rebuilt.

10:25.436 --> 10:28.856
Most notable is the fact
that one of the temple columns

10:28.857 --> 10:32.484
is capped by a lotus flower,
which in ancient Egypt

10:32.485 --> 10:35.947
represented the so-called,
"Flower of Life."

10:37.740 --> 10:41.076
The Flower
of Life is the information

10:41.077 --> 10:45.497
behind how the universe
was created.

10:45.498 --> 10:49.878
Everything in the universe
is geometric.

10:53.882 --> 10:59.094
Sacred geometry implies that
there is intelligence behind it.

10:59.095 --> 11:02.639
It's believed by mystics
to be a symbol

11:02.640 --> 11:05.893
of advanced super consciousness,

11:05.894 --> 11:08.395
a way of plugging
into the knowledge

11:08.396 --> 11:10.856
possessed
by extraterrestrial beings.

11:10.857 --> 11:15.152
Da Vinci, we can fairly say, was
practically obsessed with it.

11:15.153 --> 11:19.406
And one wonders if da Vinci
actually tapped into

11:19.407 --> 11:21.283
the ultimate cosmic secrets

11:21.284 --> 11:23.368
represented
by the Flower of Life.

11:23.369 --> 11:26.830
Cosmic secrets?

11:26.831 --> 11:30.417
Sacred geometry?

11:30.418 --> 11:33.629
Was Leonardo da Vinci
encoding his paintings

11:33.630 --> 11:36.048
with forbidden knowledge?

11:36.049 --> 11:39.259
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.971
And they believe that knowledge
may have been given to him

11:42.972 --> 11:47.936
after direct contact
with extraterrestrial beings.

11:54.779 --> 11:58.198
Recognized as a genius
even in his lifetime,

11:58.199 --> 12:02.202
Leonardo da Vinci has one of the
most thoroughly recorded lives

12:02.203 --> 12:05.914
of all the Renaissance artists.

12:05.915 --> 12:11.961
Da Vinci was such a popular
figure that his life

12:11.962 --> 12:15.006
was documented in great detail.

12:15.007 --> 12:17.008
However, what's interesting is

12:17.009 --> 12:21.221
that there are two years missing
from his existence.

12:21.222 --> 12:24.808
He basically disappeared off
of the face of the earth.

12:24.809 --> 12:30.438
From 1476 to 1478,

12:30.439 --> 12:33.650
Leonardo da Vinci's activities
completely disappear

12:33.651 --> 12:35.985
from the historical record.

12:35.986 --> 12:41.407
The gap occurs when the artist
was between 24 to 26 years old,

12:41.408 --> 12:43.868
just at the point
when he was beginning

12:43.869 --> 12:45.328
to come into prominence.

12:45.329 --> 12:49.833
So what could account
for these missing years?

12:49.834 --> 12:53.378
Ancient astronaut theorists
point to a strange experience

12:53.379 --> 12:57.340
the artist had
while hiking near a cave.

12:57.341 --> 13:01.094
It is one of the very few
autobiographical anecdotes

13:01.095 --> 13:05.849
da Vinci ever made
in his personal journal.

13:05.850 --> 13:08.351
He came across this cave.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.978
And as he stood in front of it,

13:09.979 --> 13:14.732
all of a sudden he felt drawn
to go inside

13:14.733 --> 13:17.902
in order to find out
about the miracle

13:17.903 --> 13:21.197
or the wonderment that's inside.

13:21.198 --> 13:24.075
We don't know what happened
inside this cave,

13:24.076 --> 13:26.870
but it's quite possible
that Leonardo da Vinci

13:26.871 --> 13:30.248
actually encountered
extraterrestrial teachers

13:30.249 --> 13:33.418
who then gave him
certain information.

13:33.419 --> 13:35.712
And it's this knowledge,
perhaps,

13:35.713 --> 13:38.172
that made Leonardo da Vinci

13:38.173 --> 13:40.551
the incredible genius
that he was.

13:42.887 --> 13:46.014
I'm not sure Leonardo da Vinci
went to another world,

13:46.015 --> 13:49.267
but I have a feeling
that this guy, somehow,

13:49.268 --> 13:53.813
through dreaming or going
through some kind of dimension,

13:53.814 --> 13:56.734
was able to see the future,
our future.

13:59.278 --> 14:03.072
Those we call geniuses,
such as Leonardo da Vinci,

14:03.073 --> 14:06.659
are able to discern
and detect these codes

14:06.660 --> 14:11.331
that are coming to them from
these higher levels of reality

14:11.332 --> 14:16.085
and utilize them in their work,
in their art,

14:16.086 --> 14:17.587
in their inventions

14:17.588 --> 14:21.132
to improve this physical world
that we live in.

14:21.133 --> 14:24.093
Unlike other artists,
Leonardo da Vinci

14:24.094 --> 14:27.931
did not have to measure
the ratios and the proportion.

14:27.932 --> 14:30.433
It just came
to him spontaneously.

14:30.434 --> 14:34.854
He was tapping into something
that allowed him

14:34.855 --> 14:38.441
to bring down knowledge
and information,

14:38.442 --> 14:41.278
just like
the ancient cultures did.

14:44.531 --> 14:46.783
Ancient astronaut theorists

14:46.784 --> 14:49.535
suggest that further evidence

14:49.536 --> 14:52.789
of Leonardo's contact with
extraterrestrial intelligence

14:52.790 --> 14:54.582
can be found
by a close examination

14:54.583 --> 14:56.960
of one of his most
intriguing paintings,

14:56.961 --> 14:59.587
The Virgin of the Rocks.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.756
The Virgin of the Rocks
is really a showpiece

15:01.757 --> 15:04.467
for some of Leonardo's
special techniques,

15:04.468 --> 15:07.637
including sfumato,
which adds this hazy aura.

15:07.638 --> 15:12.976
We see figures emerging
from shadows into spot lighting

15:12.977 --> 15:15.812
in a way that other artists
of his time didn't do.

15:15.813 --> 15:21.317
In March 2018, author and
researcher William Henry

15:21.318 --> 15:23.528
traveled to the outskirts
of London.

15:23.529 --> 15:27.198
There he met with da Vinci
expert Lynn Picknett

15:27.199 --> 15:31.536
in order to get her thoughts
on this unique work of art.

15:31.537 --> 15:33.705
I've just come
from the National Gallery

15:33.706 --> 15:37.083
and experienced
The Virgin of the Rocks.

15:37.084 --> 15:39.210
When you look at it, you're...

15:39.211 --> 15:40.795
you're drawn into it.

15:40.796 --> 15:43.965
- The colors, the setting...
- Mmm. Yeah.

15:43.966 --> 15:47.010
Yeah. -It's almost like it's
just coming out of the wall

15:47.011 --> 15:48.469
and you're stepping into it.

15:48.470 --> 15:50.054
Yeah, and also, there's a sense

15:50.055 --> 15:51.556
of there's something
lurking in it

15:51.557 --> 15:53.016
that we don't really get,

15:53.017 --> 15:55.477
that he's holding back a little.

15:56.854 --> 15:59.022
The Virgin of the Rocks

15:59.023 --> 16:02.150
depicts the apocryphal story
of an early meeting

16:02.151 --> 16:05.361
between the infant Jesus
and the infant John the Baptist

16:05.362 --> 16:07.030
during the time

16:07.031 --> 16:09.198
of the Holy Family's flight
to Egypt.

16:09.199 --> 16:10.950
In this painting,

16:10.951 --> 16:14.245
apparently what we have
is the baby John the Baptist

16:14.246 --> 16:16.039
kneeling to Jesus,

16:16.040 --> 16:19.208
and the Virgin Mary's got
her arm around John the Baptist.

16:19.209 --> 16:22.295
And there's an archangel,
who is Uriel.

16:22.296 --> 16:26.049
And, you know, so far, so
good, you might think.

16:26.050 --> 16:30.762
Except that the children
are with their wrong protectors.

16:30.763 --> 16:31.971
Oh.

16:31.972 --> 16:33.306
I mean, you would expect Jesus

16:33.307 --> 16:34.766
- to be with his mother.
- Mm-hmm.

16:34.767 --> 16:36.517
And it so happens that Uriel

16:36.518 --> 16:39.395
is traditionally
John the Baptist's protector.

16:39.396 --> 16:40.772
Right.

16:40.773 --> 16:43.733
Uriel is... has a big backstory

16:43.734 --> 16:45.401
with informing Noah
about the flood. -Yes.

16:45.402 --> 16:46.819
Archangel of wisdom.

16:46.820 --> 16:48.571
Yeah, yeah. Wisdom is...

16:48.572 --> 16:50.448
Yeah, that's important here.

16:50.449 --> 16:54.077
- A celestial being coming from the heavens.
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:54.078 --> 16:57.163
In one
of the so-called lost chapters

16:57.164 --> 17:00.750
of the Hebrew Bible
known as the Book of Enoch,

17:00.751 --> 17:04.127
the archangel Uriel
guides Enoch,

17:04.128 --> 17:06.130
the great-grandfather of Noah,

17:06.131 --> 17:08.049
through Heaven,
where he is taught

17:08.050 --> 17:12.386
all the secrets and mysteries
of the universe.

17:12.387 --> 17:15.223
Is it possible
that da Vinci knew

17:15.223 --> 17:19.352
of this lost and some would say
forbidden chapter of the Bible

17:19.353 --> 17:23.439
and for this reason
deliberately included Uriel

17:23.440 --> 17:25.817
as a way of sending
a secret message

17:25.818 --> 17:29.570
about what he believed to be
the extraterrestrial source

17:29.571 --> 17:31.949
of his incredible genius?

17:33.992 --> 17:36.119
And there is, as you say,

17:36.120 --> 17:37.912
something very portal-like
about this painting. -Mm-hmm.

17:37.913 --> 17:39.580
We just dropped
a very important word,

17:39.581 --> 17:41.124
as well: the word "portal."

17:41.125 --> 17:43.000
Oh, oh, yes. -It suggests
to me that this painting

17:43.001 --> 17:45.420
is a sort of portal
that he's taking us into,

17:45.421 --> 17:48.131
where something very special
is happening here. -Yes. Yes.

17:48.132 --> 17:50.550
Maybe that explains
why it's such an otherworldly,

17:50.551 --> 17:52.218
- almost dreamlike scene.
- Yeah.

17:52.219 --> 17:54.887
The veil between this world
and the other world.

17:54.888 --> 17:58.349
In his painting
The Virgin of the Rocks,

17:58.350 --> 18:01.602
did Leonardo da Vinci
deliberately plant clues

18:01.603 --> 18:05.690
that were intended
for future generations to find?

18:05.691 --> 18:08.901
Clues that gave insight
into his belief

18:08.902 --> 18:11.195
that much of mankind's knowledge

18:11.196 --> 18:15.908
had profoundly
extraterrestrial origins?

18:15.909 --> 18:19.120
Leonardo was equally fascinated
with backgrounds

18:19.121 --> 18:21.247
as he was with figures
in the foreground,

18:21.248 --> 18:22.915
and one of the things
that's so striking

18:22.916 --> 18:24.333
about Virgin of the Rocks

18:24.334 --> 18:27.295
is this very craggy,
spooky, dramatic cavern

18:27.296 --> 18:30.131
that provides the backdrop
for the figures.

18:30.132 --> 18:32.592
There are almost
no other precedents

18:32.593 --> 18:36.846
for this group of figures
in this sort of location.

18:36.847 --> 18:38.681
Could it be

18:38.682 --> 18:41.100
that Leonardo
deliberately staged this scene

18:41.101 --> 18:43.060
at the mouth of a cavern

18:43.061 --> 18:45.563
in order to draw a link
between the painting

18:45.564 --> 18:48.983
and his earlier experience
in the cave?

18:48.984 --> 18:52.320
And by placing Jesus
with the archangel Uriel,

18:52.321 --> 18:55.656
was he indicating a belief
that the archangel

18:55.657 --> 18:59.869
was actually
an extraterrestrial entity?

18:59.870 --> 19:03.706
Da Vinci's inclusion
of the archangel Uriel,

19:03.707 --> 19:07.210
it makes you wonder if Leonardo
may have had an experience

19:07.211 --> 19:09.212
with the archangel Uriel,

19:09.213 --> 19:12.299
who told him
about humanity's future.

19:14.301 --> 19:16.761
Of the only 15 known paintings

19:16.762 --> 19:19.013
attributed to Leonardo da Vinci,

19:19.014 --> 19:22.141
is it possible
that they all contain evidence

19:22.142 --> 19:23.601
of the artist's belief

19:23.602 --> 19:27.063
in so-called secret
or forbidden knowledge?

19:27.064 --> 19:30.566
And if so,
might they also contain clues

19:30.567 --> 19:32.443
that are intended to reveal

19:32.444 --> 19:35.238
not only da Vinci's
personal beliefs,

19:35.239 --> 19:38.282
but a message
that he was entrusted to convey

19:38.283 --> 19:41.245
to future generations?

19:46.135 --> 19:49.220
Milan, Italy.

19:49.221 --> 19:53.349
Housed in the monastery
of Santa Maria delle Grazie

19:53.350 --> 19:57.061
is one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most iconic paintings:

19:57.062 --> 20:00.064
The Last Supper.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.567
This imposing mural...

20:02.568 --> 20:06.738
More than 15 feet tall
and nearly 29 feet wide...

20:06.739 --> 20:10.742
Depicts the biblical moment
when Jesus tells his disciples

20:10.743 --> 20:12.703
that one of them
will betray him.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.583
It's a very poignant moment.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.419
And the disciples are reacting
to this statement,

20:21.420 --> 20:23.588
many in horror.

20:23.589 --> 20:27.425
To the left
is Saint Bartholomew,

20:27.426 --> 20:31.137
who seems to have leapt
to his feet and hit the table

20:31.138 --> 20:35.141
and is leaning towards Jesus
in shock.

20:35.142 --> 20:39.270
And third from right of Jesus
in the middle is Saint Philip,

20:39.271 --> 20:43.357
who seems to cave in with shock.

20:43.358 --> 20:46.694
What's interesting
about this Last Supper

20:46.695 --> 20:48.988
is it looks like a frozen moment
of action.

20:48.989 --> 20:50.740
If you imagine
you have a remote control

20:50.741 --> 20:53.451
and the scene is on pause
and you were to unpause it,

20:53.452 --> 20:54.952
all this movement would happen.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.789
But at this frozen moment,
you can really study

20:57.790 --> 21:01.376
the actions and reactions
of the people depicted.

21:04.963 --> 21:08.174
As with Leonardo's other works,

21:08.175 --> 21:10.885
many researchers
and ancient astronaut theorists

21:10.886 --> 21:15.807
believe that this painting
contains hidden messages.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.809
When we were writing
Templar Revelation,

21:17.810 --> 21:22.146
I looked at The Last Supper,

21:22.147 --> 21:24.148
and I thought,
"But wait a minute,

21:24.149 --> 21:26.984
that's a woman,
sitting next to Jesus."

21:26.985 --> 21:30.696
Sitting at the right
hand of Jesus is a figure

21:30.697 --> 21:34.826
that has long been assumed
to represent the apostle John.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.328
But unlike the other figures
in the painting,

21:37.329 --> 21:42.333
this one appears to have
strikingly feminine features.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.545
In his own Treatise on Painting,

21:45.546 --> 21:49.507
Leonardo writes that women
should always be depicted in art

21:49.508 --> 21:51.509
with "their heads
looking downwards,

21:51.510 --> 21:55.680
and leaning
a little on one side."

21:55.681 --> 22:00.351
If you look at Jesus sitting
at the center of the table,

22:00.352 --> 22:04.188
leaning like that,

22:04.189 --> 22:08.192
to one side, is the woman
who, with Jesus,

22:08.193 --> 22:10.027
forms a giant "M" shape,

22:10.028 --> 22:15.366
presumably, a clue to her name:
Mary, Mary Magdalene.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.952
In the Bible's New Testament,

22:17.953 --> 22:21.122
Mary Magdalene is identified
as a follower of Jesus

22:21.123 --> 22:23.583
who witnesses
both his crucifixion

22:23.584 --> 22:25.251
and his resurrection,

22:25.252 --> 22:28.671
but she was not reported
to have been a participant

22:28.672 --> 22:31.007
in what is called
the Last Supper.

22:31.008 --> 22:33.342
If that is true,

22:33.343 --> 22:36.721
then why would Leonardo
place her in his painting?

22:36.722 --> 22:39.765
Did the artist have access
to secret knowledge

22:39.766 --> 22:42.226
about the true nature
of the relationship

22:42.227 --> 22:45.271
between Jesus
and Mary Magdalene?

22:45.272 --> 22:48.691
It seems that Leonardo
was trying to point

22:48.692 --> 22:54.113
to Mary Magdalene having
been extremely close to Jesus.

22:54.114 --> 22:56.574
We have them joined at the hip,

22:56.575 --> 23:00.578
we have them wearing
mirror image clothes.

23:00.579 --> 23:06.250
Jesus, as a 30-year-old
Jewish man of the time,

23:06.251 --> 23:10.504
would've been very hard-pressed
to be without a wife.

23:10.505 --> 23:12.506
So, the theory is

23:12.507 --> 23:15.968
that Mary Magdalene
was, in fact, his wife.

23:15.969 --> 23:18.930
But the Catholic church
didn't want Jesus,

23:18.931 --> 23:22.433
as the son of God,
to have a wife.

23:22.434 --> 23:27.855
They wanted him to be celibate,
to be godlike,

23:27.856 --> 23:32.818
and so cast Mary Magdalene
as a prostitute,

23:32.819 --> 23:37.699
rather than as a woman
of importance.

23:40.077 --> 23:43.788
If Leonardo did indeed
intend to depict Mary Magdalene

23:43.789 --> 23:47.333
as the person sitting next to
Jesus, what makes her inclusion

23:47.334 --> 23:51.128
even more curious is an element
of the story that seems

23:51.129 --> 23:54.632
to have been deliberately
omitted: Jesus's chalice,

23:54.633 --> 23:58.844
otherwise known
as the Holy Grail.

23:58.845 --> 24:02.932
In the Bible, it says one of
the reasons for the Last Supper

24:02.933 --> 24:06.644
was for Jesus to instigate
the communion.

24:06.645 --> 24:09.689
His blood, represented
by the wine on the table,

24:09.690 --> 24:12.024
and his body, which was
to be broken on the cross,

24:12.025 --> 24:14.860
by the broken bread.

24:14.861 --> 24:17.863
Now, there is no great glass,

24:17.864 --> 24:21.993
or indeed, any particular glass
of wine in front of Jesus,

24:21.994 --> 24:24.495
which, in itself,
is an enormous thing.

24:24.496 --> 24:28.332
According to legend,
the Holy Grail

24:28.333 --> 24:31.002
had magical,
life-giving properties.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.628
But there are some who insist

24:32.629 --> 24:36.173
that an actual Grail
never really existed.

24:36.174 --> 24:39.176
Instead, they believe
it was a symbol,

24:39.177 --> 24:42.972
intended to represent
Jesus's divine bloodline.

24:42.973 --> 24:46.517
Many people suggest
that the Holy Grail

24:46.518 --> 24:48.686
was the body of Mary Magdalene,

24:48.687 --> 24:52.898
when she was pregnant with
the child of herself and Jesus.

24:52.899 --> 24:55.568
So this is goddess lore.

24:55.569 --> 24:58.863
The Grail is a womb,
and the true mystery,

24:58.864 --> 25:02.867
the true, sacred story,
is birth.

25:02.868 --> 25:06.245
Human birth is the miracle.

25:06.246 --> 25:08.539
Mary Magdalene,

25:08.540 --> 25:10.916
according to
a number of traditions,

25:10.917 --> 25:14.378
actually was the wife of Jesus.

25:14.379 --> 25:17.923
And she was pregnant
with his children.

25:17.924 --> 25:21.594
And in fact, these children
will be special,

25:21.595 --> 25:25.473
and carrying a special
new type of DNA

25:25.474 --> 25:28.934
for a new type of person
on Earth.

25:28.935 --> 25:31.854
And this is, literally,
the Holy Grail.

25:31.855 --> 25:34.857
Did Leonardo da Vinci

25:34.858 --> 25:37.943
have special,
extraterrestrial knowledge?

25:37.944 --> 25:40.946
Knowledge about mankind's
origins that he encoded

25:40.947 --> 25:45.201
in the form of secret messages
within his paintings?

25:45.202 --> 25:49.872
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and also suggest

25:49.873 --> 25:52.416
that within his painting
of The Last Supper

25:52.417 --> 25:56.087
is yet another,
even more profound code.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.756
One that,
when translated, will allow

25:58.757 --> 26:06.757
direct communication
with our alien ancestors.

26:07.175 --> 26:11.053
Lecce, Italy. 2003.

26:11.054 --> 26:14.890
Based on a close examination of
Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks,

26:14.891 --> 26:19.353
musician and scholar Giovanni
Maria Pala begins to examine

26:19.354 --> 26:22.815
one of the artist's most famous
works, The Last Supper,

26:22.816 --> 26:25.401
for evidence that da Vinci
may have hidden

26:25.402 --> 26:29.071
a musical composition
in the now-iconic painting.

26:29.072 --> 26:32.533
One of the intriguing theories
about Last Supper,

26:32.534 --> 26:34.702
that I actually think
has some merit,

26:34.703 --> 26:37.830
is that a scholar found
musical notes.

26:37.831 --> 26:40.416
One of the things
to keep in mind is that

26:40.417 --> 26:42.877
there's no such thing
as an accidental,

26:42.878 --> 26:44.754
or "just for the sake of it"
insertion

26:44.755 --> 26:46.589
in old master paintings.

26:46.590 --> 26:51.385
Each aspect
was carefully decided upon.

26:51.386 --> 26:53.888
Leonardo definitely
was a musician,

26:53.889 --> 26:59.101
and he served the de' Medicis
as a lyre player,

26:59.102 --> 27:02.980
and as a singer
for a number of years.

27:02.981 --> 27:06.108
He played what we would
call the organ.

27:06.109 --> 27:10.112
Well, there was an organ
in the church

27:10.113 --> 27:14.618
where he was painting
The Last Supper.

27:17.412 --> 27:19.413
In March 2018,

27:19.414 --> 27:22.750
William Henry met up with
Giovanni Maria Pala in Florence,

27:22.751 --> 27:27.963
to find out more about
his incredible theory.

27:27.964 --> 27:28.964
Hi. I'm William,
the translator.

27:28.965 --> 27:30.382
Pleasure to meet you, William.

27:30.383 --> 27:32.301
- William Henry. Nice to see you.
- Absolutely.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.636
- William Henry.
- I'm Giovanni.

27:33.637 --> 27:34.877
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

27:36.473 --> 27:39.058
How did you come to find
this evidence

27:39.059 --> 27:43.438
that in his... one of his famous
frescos is a hidden melody?

27:49.361 --> 27:50.820
So the first thing

27:50.821 --> 27:52.154
that really caught my attention
was that this is

27:52.155 --> 27:54.490
the, uh, tablecloth
of the Holy Mass.

27:54.491 --> 27:56.116
Right.

27:56.117 --> 27:58.494
And there are some
vertical lines along here,

27:58.495 --> 28:00.079
and also some horizontal lines,

28:00.080 --> 28:01.664
which prove to be
very important.

28:01.665 --> 28:03.791
And as a musician, the first
thing that came to mind

28:03.792 --> 28:06.460
seeing these horizontal lines,
was a musical pentagram.

28:06.461 --> 28:09.505
Is the musical pentagram
what we today would call

28:09.506 --> 28:12.174
- a sheet of music?
- Yes, that's exactly right.

28:12.175 --> 28:16.304
So how did you
bring this melody to life?

28:21.518 --> 28:23.435
He says you can
see here, the highlighted

28:23.436 --> 28:25.271
is these little pieces
of bread, Right.

28:25.272 --> 28:28.357
Of which there are many
all across the table here.

28:28.358 --> 28:32.070
So he pinpointed the loaves
of bread as being the notes.

28:37.909 --> 28:40.661
And another extremely
important element that he noted

28:40.662 --> 28:44.081
was the lines of the sheet
were exactly aligned

28:44.082 --> 28:46.792
with the hands of the apostles
all across the table.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.919
So the elements that really
gave life to this music

28:48.920 --> 28:50.713
are the loaves of bread

28:50.714 --> 28:52.548
and the hands of the apostles.

28:52.549 --> 28:54.718
Okay.

28:56.887 --> 28:59.263
We have to remember an important
fact that Leonardo

28:59.264 --> 29:02.433
had this peculiarity of writing
from right to left.

29:02.434 --> 29:05.144
So now let's, uh,
let's give it a listen.

29:05.145 --> 29:07.147
* *

29:52.233 --> 29:55.027
People have suggested
that through meditation,

29:55.028 --> 29:59.365
chanting, and through vibration,
essentially,

29:59.366 --> 30:03.535
that you can access
this realm of knowledge.

30:03.536 --> 30:06.121
And this realm of knowledge
is timeless.

30:06.122 --> 30:09.583
Not only does
the sound have the power

30:09.584 --> 30:11.627
to manifest all forms
of phenomena,

30:11.628 --> 30:14.964
it also has the power
to manifest

30:14.965 --> 30:17.800
how one perceives
that very phenomena.

30:17.801 --> 30:22.429
In both Hinduism and Buddhism,
as well Jainism,

30:22.430 --> 30:25.599
even religions such as Sikhism,
you have specific mantras

30:25.600 --> 30:29.478
that are tuned to these deities.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.605
So these mantras are used

30:31.606 --> 30:35.651
both to create
a rapport, connection

30:35.652 --> 30:37.403
with these deities,
to summon them,

30:37.404 --> 30:39.072
to help you manifest them.

30:41.825 --> 30:44.326
The idea that harmonic sounds

30:44.327 --> 30:47.955
or music might be the ideal
means of communication

30:47.956 --> 30:51.333
with extraterrestrial beings
was a key component

30:51.334 --> 30:55.088
of NASA's Voyager program
in 1977.

30:57.173 --> 31:00.134
Originally designed
as a pair of robotic probes

31:00.135 --> 31:03.512
which could collect and send
back important information

31:03.513 --> 31:07.850
about the Earth's sister
planets, Voyagers 1 and 2

31:07.851 --> 31:10.352
each carried a large golden disc

31:10.353 --> 31:14.815
onto which various images
and sounds were recorded.

31:14.816 --> 31:17.568
The disc and its contents
were the brainchild

31:17.569 --> 31:20.863
of famed astronomer Carl Sagan,
who worked closely

31:20.864 --> 31:25.034
with space artist and science
journalist John Lomberg.

31:25.035 --> 31:28.203
I felt that art,
visual arts and music

31:28.204 --> 31:32.374
might be as legitimate a content
of interstellar communication

31:32.375 --> 31:34.918
as math and physics,
which he thought interesting.

31:34.919 --> 31:36.712
If they were to ask me

31:36.713 --> 31:39.048
what to send
to establish communication,

31:39.049 --> 31:41.050
I'd send them music.

31:41.051 --> 31:46.722
The mathematical relationships
that underlie most aesthetics,

31:46.723 --> 31:49.266
and whether you're talking
about intervals in music,

31:49.267 --> 31:51.060
like harmony,

31:51.061 --> 31:54.021
or whether you're talking
about proportion in architecture

31:54.022 --> 31:55.564
or painting,

31:55.565 --> 31:57.858
these things are not things
that we just conjure up

31:57.859 --> 31:59.568
out of our own minds.

31:59.569 --> 32:02.154
They're a reflection
of the beautiful fractal nature

32:02.155 --> 32:04.114
of the universe.

32:04.115 --> 32:07.868
Did you ever see the movie Close
Encounters of the Third Kind?

32:07.869 --> 32:09.036
Uh, si.

32:09.037 --> 32:11.080
The spaceship lands

32:11.081 --> 32:13.749
at the Devils Tower,
and it starts playing tones,

32:13.750 --> 32:16.585
the language of the universe,

32:16.586 --> 32:18.630
and it loops infinitely.

32:20.882 --> 32:23.426
The melody begins with an E.

32:25.095 --> 32:27.931
And it ends with an E as well.

32:29.307 --> 32:33.560
And it can be repeated, um,
pretty much infinitely.

32:33.561 --> 32:35.270
If Leonardo da Vinci

32:35.271 --> 32:37.981
really did encode musical notes

32:37.982 --> 32:40.234
within his painting
of the Last Supper,

32:40.235 --> 32:42.236
what was his purpose?

32:42.237 --> 32:45.614
Was he trying to convey
an important message to humanity

32:45.615 --> 32:47.783
from another world?

32:47.784 --> 32:51.120
Or... was he trying
to teach humanity

32:51.121 --> 32:53.580
the means by which it
can communicate

32:53.581 --> 32:57.001
with its extraterrestrial
ancestors?

33:03.647 --> 33:07.900
It is here, in what some
would call an unlikely setting,

33:07.901 --> 33:10.111
that the world's
most expensive work of art,

33:10.112 --> 33:13.448
Leonardo da Vinci's
Salvator Mundi, will reside.

33:14.491 --> 33:18.995
Established in November 2017,

33:18.996 --> 33:21.998
this architectural marvel
consists of a floating dome

33:21.999 --> 33:26.002
created from a complex
geometric design

33:26.003 --> 33:28.004
of 7,800 interlocking stars

33:28.005 --> 33:32.008
that cast beams of light
into the space below.

33:32.009 --> 33:34.385
Its appearance has been likened

33:34.386 --> 33:36.721
to that of a giant
flying saucer,

33:36.722 --> 33:39.849
and the museum's architect,
Jean Nouvel,

33:39.850 --> 33:42.059
says his goal was
to emphasize the fascination

33:42.060 --> 33:45.105
generated by rare encounters.

33:47.524 --> 33:50.067
The museum
looks like this giant disc

33:50.068 --> 33:53.571
with thousands of stars.

33:53.572 --> 33:56.240
Are they trying
to signal something,

33:56.241 --> 33:59.952
or is it purely
an architectural choice?

33:59.953 --> 34:03.080
But why is
this futuristic museum

34:03.081 --> 34:06.083
considered by many
ancient astronaut enthusiasts

34:06.084 --> 34:08.127
to be the most
appropriate setting

34:08.128 --> 34:11.088
for what others would consider
a traditional depiction

34:11.089 --> 34:12.924
of Jesus Christ?

34:12.925 --> 34:14.550
And what is it

34:14.551 --> 34:18.304
about this 518-year-old
Renaissance painting

34:18.304 --> 34:21.933
that compelled its owner
to pay such a record price?

34:21.934 --> 34:23.935
$400 million is the bid.

34:23.936 --> 34:26.772
And the piece is... sold!

34:29.565 --> 34:31.900
I'm looking forward to seeing
what we've got inside.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.110
During his meeting
with art historian

34:34.112 --> 34:35.612
Dr. Michael Kwakkelstein

34:35.614 --> 34:38.699
at the Dutch University
Institute for Art History

34:38.699 --> 34:40.952
in March 2017,

34:40.953 --> 34:43.955
ancient astronaut theorist
and author William Henry

34:43.956 --> 34:47.123
- Ah, there we go.
- Decided to share his thoughts

34:47.125 --> 34:51.462
concerning da Vinci's
recently discovered masterpiece.

34:51.463 --> 34:54.130
He's got that lion-like gaze,

34:54.132 --> 34:57.468
just very powerful, staring
directly at us. -Mesmerizing.

34:57.469 --> 34:59.470
Mona Lisa smile, slightly.

34:59.471 --> 35:03.641
But it's this crystal sphere
that draws people in.

35:03.642 --> 35:06.143
This, in fact,
is the Cintamani Stone,

35:06.144 --> 35:09.313
the wish-fulfilling gem
of Tibetan Buddhism.

35:09.314 --> 35:12.108
The Cintamani Stone?

35:12.109 --> 35:14.151
A legendary relic that appears

35:14.152 --> 35:16.738
in many examples
of Buddhist art?

35:18.323 --> 35:21.826
But why would Leonardo da Vinci
depict Jesus Christ

35:21.827 --> 35:26.330
holding an orb that features
a Buddhist symbol?

35:26.331 --> 35:28.791
Gemani means "jewel,"

35:28.792 --> 35:31.460
and chinta, in this case,
is referring to "wishes."

35:31.461 --> 35:33.504
It's the jewel
that grants wishes.

35:33.505 --> 35:36.674
If you look at deities
like Ksitigarbha,

35:36.675 --> 35:39.510
he actually is holding it
in his hand,

35:39.511 --> 35:42.638
and it looks like a little orb.

35:42.639 --> 35:45.224
And he can travel
through all the six realms

35:45.225 --> 35:48.185
where various beings dwell.

35:48.186 --> 35:50.938
In Buddhist scripture,
the Cintamani Stone

35:50.939 --> 35:54.900
is often described as
a wish-fulfilling crystal sphere

35:54.901 --> 35:58.571
and is most often seen in
the possession of a Bodhisattva,

35:58.572 --> 36:01.198
or enlightened teacher.

36:01.199 --> 36:04.869
Much like Jesus holding the orb
in the Salvator Mundi painting,

36:04.870 --> 36:07.371
the Bodhisattva
is usually depicted

36:07.372 --> 36:11.876
holding the Cintamani Stone
in the palm of his hand.

36:11.877 --> 36:14.503
But how would a 15th century
Renaissance artist...

36:14.504 --> 36:16.213
A Roman Catholic...

36:16.214 --> 36:19.216
Have known about
a 10th-century Buddhist symbol?

36:19.217 --> 36:21.677
And why would he
have included it

36:21.678 --> 36:24.806
in an otherwise traditional
religious painting?

36:26.850 --> 36:29.018
For William Henry,
a key to the answer

36:29.019 --> 36:31.228
may be found
by noting the presence

36:31.229 --> 36:34.565
of three simple white dots,
or stars,

36:34.566 --> 36:38.736
floating inside
the transparent orb.

36:38.737 --> 36:42.031
We have those triple dots
on that sphere

36:42.032 --> 36:44.075
that symbolize
the three stars of Orion,

36:44.076 --> 36:46.744
indicating that there's
this cosmic connection

36:46.745 --> 36:48.914
that they're trying to make.

36:50.082 --> 36:51.832
Orion?

36:51.833 --> 36:54.377
The constellation that
the ancient Egyptians believed

36:54.378 --> 36:57.213
was the place of origin
for the gods?

36:57.214 --> 36:59.715
And whose three
most prominent stars,

36:59.716 --> 37:02.510
which form what is referred to
as Orion's Belt,

37:02.511 --> 37:04.970
are oriented
in precise alignment

37:04.971 --> 37:07.890
with not only
the great pyramids of Egypt,

37:07.891 --> 37:10.434
but also Teotihuacan in Mexico?

37:10.435 --> 37:12.561
The ancient Egyptians believed

37:12.562 --> 37:15.356
that their gods,
Osiris in particular,

37:15.357 --> 37:18.275
came from Orion.

37:18.276 --> 37:21.445
And that upon his resurrection
from the Earth,

37:21.446 --> 37:24.615
Osiris returned to Orion.

37:24.616 --> 37:29.411
Is it possible that
what this painting is showing

37:29.412 --> 37:31.789
is that Jesus himself

37:31.790 --> 37:37.294
is somehow
from the constellation Orion,

37:37.295 --> 37:41.924
and that that
is ultimately where we,

37:41.925 --> 37:45.261
as a human species, are from?

37:45.262 --> 37:48.097
We have this
very powerful connection

37:48.098 --> 37:51.142
between the resurrection
of Osiris, going to Orion,

37:51.143 --> 37:56.105
and Christ ultimately
returning from Orion.

37:56.106 --> 37:59.483
When we look at Christ holding
this crystalline orb,

37:59.484 --> 38:02.153
it's trying to tell us
that there's a...

38:02.154 --> 38:04.613
a higher intelligence
that operates in our world.

38:04.614 --> 38:06.157
He tapped into it.

38:06.158 --> 38:08.033
But ultimately he's saying,

38:08.034 --> 38:12.080
there's a cosmic intelligence
interwoven within human history.

38:13.540 --> 38:16.125
Is it possible
that Leonardo da Vinci

38:16.126 --> 38:19.754
was in possession
of extraterrestrial knowledge?

38:22.007 --> 38:26.051
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe the answers can be found

38:26.052 --> 38:27.636
by examining the artist's final

38:27.637 --> 38:30.264
and perhaps most prophetic
work of art,

38:30.265 --> 38:34.477
one which many believe
hides a startling portrait.

38:37.459 --> 38:41.254
Amboise, France. 1513.

38:41.255 --> 38:43.506
At Château du Clos Lucé,

38:43.507 --> 38:45.842
a 61-year-old Leonardo da Vinci

38:45.843 --> 38:49.929
begins work on what will be
his final painting.

38:49.930 --> 38:52.348
Three years later,
he completes his portrait

38:52.349 --> 38:54.183
of an androgynous figure

38:54.184 --> 38:56.352
emerging
from a shadowy background...

38:56.353 --> 38:59.355
Saint John the Baptist.

38:59.356 --> 39:04.068
Picture this painting
in a dimly lit chapel.

39:04.069 --> 39:06.321
Before lighting the candle,
you don't see anything.

39:06.322 --> 39:07.989
- Right.
- You light the candle,

39:07.990 --> 39:10.533
and the light of the flame
illuminates the painting,

39:10.534 --> 39:13.077
and there emerges,
against a dark background,

39:13.078 --> 39:15.038
Saint John the Baptist.

39:15.039 --> 39:16.622
And the pointing upward
to heaven,

39:16.623 --> 39:18.291
saying: I'm from the light,

39:18.292 --> 39:19.917
I'm witnessing to the light.

39:19.918 --> 39:21.627
He's pointing to another realm.

39:21.628 --> 39:23.087
Oh, yes.

39:23.088 --> 39:26.174
This is where divine wisdom
comes from.

39:26.175 --> 39:28.676
This is the source
of everything.

39:28.677 --> 39:31.888
The first words of Saint John
are, "I saw the light.

39:31.889 --> 39:34.474
- I will come to this Earth."
- Wow.

39:34.475 --> 39:37.268
Leonardo was encoding

39:37.269 --> 39:41.147
extraordinary secrets
in his paintings.

39:41.148 --> 39:43.775
He wanted to imbue his work

39:43.776 --> 39:48.237
for the future generations
with his own private message.

39:48.238 --> 39:52.075
His paintings are like
portals to another world,

39:52.076 --> 39:54.243
where the real Leonardo
inhabits.

39:54.244 --> 39:56.245
But whether we're big enough

39:56.246 --> 40:00.291
to accept what he has to say
is quite another matter.

40:00.292 --> 40:05.296
I think he had some very subtle
messages he wanted to convey

40:05.297 --> 40:09.258
to not the people of that time,
but to the people of our time.

40:09.259 --> 40:11.427
And we have to look for it.

40:11.428 --> 40:13.930
Is he talking
about extraterrestrials?

40:13.931 --> 40:16.432
Is he talking about the future?

40:16.433 --> 40:19.644
Investigators
have recently found

40:19.645 --> 40:21.562
some pretty astonishing things

40:21.563 --> 40:25.108
about Leonardo da Vinci's
painting John the Baptist.

40:25.109 --> 40:29.278
And they mirror the image
to create a double image,

40:29.279 --> 40:32.573
and then through
an enhancement process,

40:32.574 --> 40:36.160
they are able to bring out
what seems to be

40:36.161 --> 40:39.122
the face of an extraterrestrial.

40:39.123 --> 40:41.290
It's a pretty unusual thing,

40:41.291 --> 40:44.168
and we know that da Vinci

40:44.169 --> 40:47.588
did use this
mirroring technique.

40:47.589 --> 40:49.966
And so this isn't something
that is so farfetched

40:49.967 --> 40:52.302
that he would do.

40:53.679 --> 40:57.723
Da Vinci is one
of a long line of artists

40:57.724 --> 40:59.976
who have told us, beginning
with the ancient Egyptians

40:59.977 --> 41:02.812
and running through the early
Christians and Tibetans,

41:02.813 --> 41:06.691
that art is a medium,
it's a conduit

41:06.692 --> 41:09.485
through which ordinary people
can connect

41:09.486 --> 41:14.240
with higher-dimensional beings,
even extraterrestrials.

41:14.241 --> 41:16.450
And I think this is
the ultimate message

41:16.451 --> 41:18.995
that Leonardo placed
in the codes

41:18.996 --> 41:21.456
and the symbols
within his paintings.

41:22.833 --> 41:25.209
Did Leonardo da Vinci experience

41:25.210 --> 41:29.046
an extraterrestrial encounter,
one that opened his mind

41:29.047 --> 41:33.509
to what was once considered
forbidden knowledge?

41:33.510 --> 41:36.512
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

41:36.513 --> 41:40.850
and believe that da Vinci
encoded his works in such a way

41:40.851 --> 41:43.895
that future generations
could learn the truth

41:43.896 --> 41:46.856
about mankind's origins.

41:46.857 --> 41:49.400
And that, when fully understood,

41:49.401 --> 41:52.945
will lead the way
to our ultimate destiny.
