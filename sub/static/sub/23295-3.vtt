00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
Come on.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.320
I'm not sure
we should be doing this.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.520
We can't let Sybil take the blame.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.480
If every witch was booted out
the moment they made a mistake,

01:02.760 --> 01:04.680
I'd never have survived my first day.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.600
- What if we get caught?
- We won't.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.240
We're just taking the Founding Stone
from Sybil's room,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.520
and putting it back
where it's meant to be.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.760
Now let's go and get Enid.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.640
What are you doing?

01:29.960 --> 01:32.000
I've seen this in lots of films.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.280
- Always worth trying the handle first.
- Quickly, Millie.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
It's gone!

01:43.120 --> 01:44.120
It can't have.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
It has.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.400
What if one of the teachers
found it?

01:48.480 --> 01:51.120
I think we'd have known
about that, don't you?

01:51.200 --> 01:53.480
The first-years would have been expelled
hours ago.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.160
- Well, where is it, then?
- I've no idea!

01:56.400 --> 02:00.480
It wasn't bad enough that Miss Cackle
thinks the Stone's missing, now it is!

02:00.920 --> 02:02.280
Who knew it was here?

02:09.199 --> 02:10.199
What are you doing?

02:11.039 --> 02:13.240
I might ask you three the same thing.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.240
The Founding Stone's vanished.
For real, this time.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.520
- What?
- What have you done with it?

02:19.040 --> 02:21.320
Me? Why are you asking me?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.600
Well, you aren't exactly fast asleep,
are you?

02:23.920 --> 02:26.960
Only because I've got much more
important things on my mind.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.080
Ugh. What's that smell?

02:31.520 --> 02:33.880
A pair of kippers in a pair of slippers,

02:34.160 --> 02:36.840
the essential ingredient
of every Clone Spell.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.480
Clone spells are against the Code!

02:39.640 --> 02:43.480
Well, after the start I've had
to this term, I've got to do something.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.280
It's time for me
to be the best witch again.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.280
So, what are you going to copy?

02:49.520 --> 02:50.520
Me.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.840
I'm going to wow the teachers
by working twice as hard as before,

02:54.040 --> 02:56.840
and what better way to do that
than by having an extra Ethel!

02:56.920 --> 02:58.600
No way! Not happening.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.560
Maud's right.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.840
And unless you pour that away this minute,
we're going to Miss Cackle.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.840
I'll give you a hand.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.960
Come on. Ethel wasn't the only one
to know where the Stone was.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.520
Wait.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.360
- I think you should do it.
- Why?

03:14.440 --> 03:17.240
Because if it works,
tomorrow I'm doing it, too.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.720
Just imagine.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.920
Another me
to do all the boring bits of my life,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.480
whilst I have fun-fun-fun.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.760
- Where are you going?
- We're gonna need some more kippers.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.920
Nightstar!

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
Shh!

03:41.560 --> 03:42.600
Evening.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.600
Have you done it?
Have you put the Stone back?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.520
I was hoping you were gonna
say you knew where it was.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.480
No. You?

03:55.560 --> 03:57.000
Don't ask me.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.560
Bea?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
Where is she?

04:05.120 --> 04:07.680
It's time to say hello to Ethel Two.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.880
Any sign?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.560
Bea, is that you?

04:28.280 --> 04:30.840
- Who else is it going to be?
- Where are you?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.080
You're soaking!

04:37.560 --> 04:39.920
I know the beds at Cackle's
aren't very comfortable,

04:40.040 --> 04:41.720
but they must be better than this.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.160
It wasn't intentional.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.960
First sneeze, I ended up in the pond,
and it was all downhill from there.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.560
I'll have to hold my nostrils shut now.
My nose is a lethal weapon.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.880
You didn't go back to Sybil's room
and get the Stone?

05:01.280 --> 05:02.640
Why would I do that?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.880
<i>Let this witch be where she wants.</i>

05:08.960 --> 05:12.080
<i>Not one place, but two at once.</i>

05:22.880 --> 05:24.120
Are you all right, Ethel?

05:28.240 --> 05:31.200
Whoa. This is crazy!

05:31.880 --> 05:33.840
Hello, broomstick alert!

05:34.040 --> 05:35.560
Race you round the corridors.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.000
You aren't allowed to fly indoors.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.560
You're not allowed to do a Clone Spell
either, but it didn't put you off!

05:43.320 --> 05:45.040
Wakey-wakey!

05:45.120 --> 05:46.720
Keep it down, will you?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.560
Why? Let's get the gang together.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.680
Have a midnight feast.
The party to end all parties!

05:53.760 --> 05:56.320
- No.
- Come on.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.600
You only live once.
And in my case, probably not for long.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.880
I don't understand it.
She isn't the least bit Ethel-y.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.680
You don't think it would matter

06:06.760 --> 06:10.440
if the new kippers
weren't actually kippers, do you?

06:10.960 --> 06:14.520
I mean, if they were anchovies,
or herring, or...

06:14.600 --> 06:17.400
- Enid!
- Well, I'm a witch, not a fishmonger!

06:17.600 --> 06:19.920
Because of you,
this isn't the exact potion.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.160
It's an almost exact one,
so this isn't the exact me,

06:23.440 --> 06:25.440
it's some Almost Ethel instead.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.720
Look, there's a bit left.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
Can I have a go?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.920
We could seriously Ethel this place up.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.840
You need to calm down.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.040
You need to lighten up.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.560
- When does the spell run out?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.880
And until then, you're not going anywhere.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.600
You need to stay out of trouble,
and out of sight,

06:44.680 --> 06:46.120
or we're all in bother.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
Oh!

06:51.880 --> 06:54.720
What? If you ask me, it's an improvement.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
Humph.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.480
You did your best for them,
but the first-years

07:01.560 --> 07:04.240
are just gonna have to own up
and face the consequences.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.960
There's nothing else you can do.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.640
'Night.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.080
It's no good.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.960
We need to tell
the Magic Council immediately.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
They'll shut us down.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.920
If they found out we'd kept
the Stone's disappearance a secret,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.200
the repercussions
would be even more grave.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.920
Give me until lunchtime.
I'm certain I can track it down.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.880
We'll tell the girls
we've temporarily removed it from display.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.720
- But where will you even start?
- Oh, I know exactly where.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.240
There's someone I've had my eye on
since the moment they arrived.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.320
Last night, when you were sneezing
your way round the school,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.480
did you notice anything odd?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.920
I mean, besides us,
Enid and Ethel were up.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.800
But, what about anyone else?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.200
No.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.040
Sorry.

08:15.880 --> 08:16.880
Okay.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.880
Hold on. There was one thing.

08:22.720 --> 08:28.520
There was a light on in the old storeroom.
Someone must have been in there,

08:28.880 --> 08:31.240
even though
it was the middle of the night.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.880
Where has she been all night?

08:35.559 --> 08:37.960
Do you mind not following me
around in daylight?

08:38.080 --> 08:40.240
You're seriously damaging
my corridor cred.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.159
Uh, excuse me, it was your kipper slip
that got me into this mess.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.040
- Morning, Miss Bat.
- Morning, girls.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.120
- I love what you've done with your hair!
- Oh!

08:51.520 --> 08:53.920
Look, forget about the other you.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.760
My bet is, she's already left
and gone for good.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.640
Hi!

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
Bye!

09:02.320 --> 09:03.320
Or you know...

09:04.080 --> 09:05.120
maybe not.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.280
What am I gonna do now?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.560
If I go in there,
everyone will find out about the spell.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.920
You're going to have to
keep her out of trouble.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.720
- No chance!
- Oh, I think there's every chance.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.160
Unless you want Mildred and Maud
to know that you talked me into it,

09:22.240 --> 09:23.680
you won't let me down.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.360
Meet you at the main entrance at lunch.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.880
Hello, second-years!

09:33.960 --> 09:35.760
Seats please, girls.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.080
Ethel, over here.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.040
Nah, gonna hang with my old chum, Nightie.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.800
I just spent the last seven hours
making potions.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.720
Today is really gonna go off with a bang.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.280
I think she's just trying
to make up for last night.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.680
What are you gonna do
about the Founding Stone?

09:59.760 --> 10:03.320
Simple. When Miss Bat nods off,
I'm meeting up with the first-years.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.040
To go tell Miss Cackle?

10:05.720 --> 10:07.960
No, to go get it back.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.200
I think we'd better come with you.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.080
I... I think I'll stay here.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.600
I suppose you were tucked up in bed
all night with no alibi whatsoever.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.240
No, I wasn't, actually.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
Oh?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.600
Well, where were you, then?

10:36.240 --> 10:40.240
At Miss Drill's birthday party
in the North Tower.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.600
First I've heard of it.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.760
Well...

10:43.920 --> 10:46.560
the guest list
was rather exclusive.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.640
I had a whole room
full of alibis, I suppose.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.200
I just wasn't aware
at the time that I'd need them.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.400
Ethel...!

11:21.320 --> 11:24.360
Are you all right, Eth?
You don't seem yourself.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.120
Trust me, I'm having the time of my life.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.040
<i>Drink this potion if you dare...</i>

11:35.520 --> 11:37.960
<i>For it's sure to raise your hair.</i>

11:40.240 --> 11:42.280
What?

11:42.360 --> 11:44.680
Oh, yes. Quite.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.480
As you were.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.360
Mmm.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
Did I drop off for a moment?

12:03.440 --> 12:05.960
Suppose I must have seemed
rather amusing.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.120
Apologies, all.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.640
Miss Bat, I was wondering if...

12:12.840 --> 12:13.840
Yes?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
What...

12:18.120 --> 12:21.000
have you done to your...?

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
Oh.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.360
You've noticed my little update?

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
It's...

12:28.640 --> 12:29.680
Yes?

12:30.640 --> 12:31.920
It's ridiculous!

12:34.440 --> 12:35.440
How dare you?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.120
No, but...

12:37.200 --> 12:39.440
Begone, sir! Begone!

12:42.040 --> 12:44.920
- Are you sure it was this one?
- I think so.

12:46.160 --> 12:50.760
Doesn't look like anyone's been here
for about a thousand years.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.280
Maybe there's a reason for that.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.880
Right, come on.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.240
Anything?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.680
Then perhaps I can help.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.160
Would anyone like to tell me
what's going on?

13:17.080 --> 13:19.120
The thing is, Miss Mould,

13:19.200 --> 13:21.880
Beatrice, Clarice and I were
in the Great Hall yesterday...

13:21.960 --> 13:24.840
Sybil said that she was feeling
awfully homesick,

13:24.920 --> 13:27.360
what with the fire
and having her cat taken off her.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.880
You know what I said?

13:31.960 --> 13:34.720
"A mirror, that's what you need!
All of your own."

13:34.800 --> 13:37.640
Forget queuing at the booth.
You can speak to your mum anytime!

13:38.120 --> 13:42.280
Strictly speaking,
that's against school rules.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.840
But I am prepared to overlook it,
if it helps.

13:47.320 --> 13:51.120
- How are you feeling now, Sybil?
- Oh, she's in the form of her life.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.600
Cock-a-hoop, full o' beans!

14:00.640 --> 14:02.200
Take it to your room,

14:02.280 --> 14:05.600
then go straight back to your classes.
All of you.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.640
What are you doing?

14:11.840 --> 14:15.040
- There's no getting out of it now.
- Oh, yes, there is.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.640
- The Stone!
- Nice one, Millie.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.880
- Ethel, you've really changed.
- I'd like to think so.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.840
<i>"The Witch's Guide
to Essential Antidotes."</i>

14:39.520 --> 14:41.000
Whoo-hoo!

14:45.080 --> 14:47.560
Did you have a birthday party last night?

14:47.960 --> 14:51.000
I... um,

14:51.080 --> 14:53.440
didn't think it'd be your sort of thing.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.120
Was Miss Mould there?

14:56.360 --> 14:57.360
Yes.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.320
She left early, though. Don't know why.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.960
Miss Drill, Miss Drill!

15:03.040 --> 15:05.320
It's Miss Bat, she's...

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
Yes!

15:17.040 --> 15:19.240
<i>If this Spell you must undo.</i>

15:19.560 --> 15:22.080
<i>Don't add one spoon, make it two!</i>

15:26.800 --> 15:28.640
Miss Bat? May we come in?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.760
I'm trying to teach here, you know!

15:35.920 --> 15:36.920
Come in!

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
Oh.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.040
I heard you'd done something with your...

15:47.360 --> 15:49.840
It's a very subtle restyling.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.360
Yes, it is, Miss Bat. I'm sorry.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.800
Wizards are so conventional.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.280
But, but...

15:57.080 --> 15:58.200
But, she...

16:03.320 --> 16:04.320
Hey!

16:09.360 --> 16:12.840
- All fine here! How about you?
- Got the Founding Stone back.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.400
As soon as we can put it
where Miss Cackle can find it,

16:15.480 --> 16:16.720
everything's gonna be okay.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.960
What do you think you're doing?

16:24.120 --> 16:27.040
I don't know
what your little game is, Miss Mould.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.760
But I know there is one.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.080
Miss Hardbroom
seems to have got it into her head

16:35.160 --> 16:39.120
that I'm some kind of evil witch
hell-bent on destroying the school.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.160
I'm sorry.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.800
It's just that we have had trouble
with that sort of thing before, you know.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.200
Well, that's as maybe,

16:45.280 --> 16:47.880
but when she starts
turning my classroom upside down

16:47.960 --> 16:51.360
in search of I don't know what,
then I have to speak out.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.800
- Found what you're looking for?
- No.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.800
Then I think you owe Marigold an apology.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.680
My...

17:12.480 --> 17:15.200
mistake.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.640
Enough of these staff-room shenanigans,

17:19.720 --> 17:22.079
I need the assistance
of someone on the inside.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.119
Ah, Mildred Hubble, Maud Spellbody,
a word, please?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.400
- But we were just...
- Psst.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.560
I'll take your bag.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.880
It's okay.
I'll meet you in the main entrance.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.800
Guard it with your life.

17:34.960 --> 17:38.800
Girls, I am going to tell you
something now of the utmost importance.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.880
I need you to promise
you won't tell a soul.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.200
Of course, Miss Cackle.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.760
The Founding Stone
has not been removed from display.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.280
- It has been stolen!
- Oh.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
Oh!

17:50.840 --> 17:53.920
I need you to keep your eyes open
and ears to the ground.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.320
Won't be a problem.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.720
- I'm sure we'll have it back in no time.
- I hope you're right.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.160
Because the fate of the school
depends upon it.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.120
Report back to me
at the end of lunchtime.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.120
<i>Let this witch be where she wants.</i>

18:13.520 --> 18:16.480
<i>Not one place, but lots at once.</i>

18:23.480 --> 18:24.360
Well?

18:24.440 --> 18:26.600
Don't worry,
I got all the potions off her.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.280
- Potions?
- It's all sorted and she'll be gone soon.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.480
- Now can we please be enemies again?
- With pleasure.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.280
What are you smiling at?
Honestly, some people are so two-faced.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
Where's my bag?

18:39.480 --> 18:43.600
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Ethel, she just gave it you. I was there.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
- Well, I wasn't.
- Oh, no.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.160
What?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.920
You did the Clone Spell, didn't you?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.960
No, we did.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.680
I couldn't see the harm in it.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.200
If it'd worked,
think of all the fun we could have had.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.120
There's another you?

19:04.280 --> 19:08.280
Yes, and we all have to stay away from her
because she is out of control.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.680
But... I just gave her the Stone.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.920
This could not get any worse.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.920
Mother?

19:22.600 --> 19:23.800
Ethel?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.160
Sybil?

19:26.240 --> 19:29.640
Mrs. Hallow,
to what do we owe the pleasure?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.440
It was my suggestion, actually.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.600
Young Sybil's
been feeling a little homesick.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.000
So I thought talking
to her mother in person

19:38.080 --> 19:40.160
would be better
than talking to a reflection.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.280
And when, pray tell,

19:42.360 --> 19:44.760
was anyone thinking of telling me
about this fire?

19:45.320 --> 19:47.200
Oh. Uh...

19:47.280 --> 19:50.800
I think I need to speak to my girls.
Urgently.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.560
- Do you have any idea what you've done?
- Sorry?

19:54.640 --> 19:57.840
Mrs. Hallow is one of the most important
members of the Magic Council!

19:57.920 --> 20:00.960
Miss Mould,
I'm afraid the Founding Stone's missing.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.880
And if Mrs. Hallow realizes...

20:03.960 --> 20:07.840
the Council will shut us down.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.200
You need to find the other Ethel.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.560
We need to work out
a way to get rid of her.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.360
I... I think I can help.

20:29.400 --> 20:34.040
Oh, I am terribly sorry
about earlier, my dear.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
Cup of tea?

20:38.240 --> 20:40.200
Well, as it's you, Algy,

20:40.840 --> 20:42.680
I accept your apology.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.800
Once a frog, always a frog!

21:43.400 --> 21:45.600
Okay, the game's up.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.960
Hand over the Stone.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.560
No Almost Ethel was ever going
to get the better of the real one.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.600
True, but a few of us might.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.680
The clone's cloned herself!

22:07.160 --> 22:09.920
What? I thought you enjoyed
your own company.

22:17.960 --> 22:18.960
Sybil?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.240
What on earth is going on?

22:21.960 --> 22:24.320
I hear you're burning the school down?

22:24.920 --> 22:28.320
And you and your sister are running off
at the very sight of me.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.920
It's all very distressing.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.480
The fire was an accident, Mum.

22:32.920 --> 22:33.920
I promise.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.800
But I'm kind of glad it happened.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.680
Because the way
everyone's looked after me since,

22:42.120 --> 22:45.320
has made me realize that I have something
I've never had before.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.120
True friends.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.120
I completely understand
your concern, Mrs. Hallow.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.360
But if you'd like to come through,
I'm sure I can put your mind at rest.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.080
Have you found it, Sybil?

23:07.240 --> 23:11.600
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.640
The Founding Stone.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.200
- The Founding Stone?
- Oops.

23:21.720 --> 23:25.720
Oh, it's nothing. It's just been
on display in the Hall, that's all.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.840
I trust you've had someone
guarding it at all times?

23:31.880 --> 23:34.440
I think I need to take a look, don't you?

23:39.520 --> 23:43.240
You know what your problem is,
Ethel? You're all, "me, me, me."

23:44.840 --> 23:47.040
Ignore her, Ethel.
When you sip this antidote,

23:47.120 --> 23:49.000
all other versions of you
will disappear.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.160
Wait! She isn't the real Ethel.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.680
And neither is she. I am.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.760
Ethels. Ethels everywhere!

23:56.720 --> 24:00.320
This... is my worst nightmare.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.240
Mildred, I'm Ethel.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.560
Look, I'm the only one without a bag.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.360
No, she isn't. She just gave me this one.

24:09.480 --> 24:13.240
She's shuffled us around to confuse you.
And they're all pretending to be me.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.000
But I'm Ethel. Can't you see?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.120
If you give this potion
to the wrong one,

24:19.200 --> 24:21.560
you'll make the right one
disappear forever!

24:22.040 --> 24:25.280
But if you don't give it to any of them,
we'll never get the Stone back.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.880
What are we to say
when she sees it isn't there?

24:31.960 --> 24:34.200
The truth, Miss Hardbroom, the truth!

24:35.320 --> 24:37.640
Yesterday, I was desperate to go home.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.520
Now I'd do anything in the world to stay.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.040
Right, whoever's the real Ethel,
repeat after me.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.560
All other versions of me, begone.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.960
"All other versions of me,
begone."

24:49.400 --> 24:52.840
Let I alone be the only one.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.280
"Let I alone be the only one."

24:55.760 --> 24:57.200
They're coming, Millie!

24:59.680 --> 25:01.800
It's me, Millie. You can trust me.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.680
I wouldn't lie to you.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.000
Mildred, my old friend.

25:08.520 --> 25:11.200
You'll make the right decision,
you always do.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.800
You've got to be kidding me.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.960
She's completely useless!

25:16.840 --> 25:18.120
I'm doomed.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.720
Ethel, it's you!

25:20.120 --> 25:23.240
- How can you be sure?
- All the others are much too nice.

25:41.160 --> 25:44.720
Oh, hello, Miss Cackle.
Just admiring the Stone.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.800
Oh!

25:47.160 --> 25:49.680
It's even more beautiful
than I'd imagined.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.800
Sorry I had to run off before, Mother.

25:52.080 --> 25:55.160
It was our turn to keep guard,
and you can never be too careful.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.520
I couldn't agree more.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.720
You've no need to worry
about either of us.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.200
I've really learned
a lot about myself lately.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.360
Well, you two might be fine,

26:05.440 --> 26:08.000
but Esmerelda is anything but.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.720
And I think it is high time
I returned to her.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.720
Where did you find it?

26:17.840 --> 26:20.560
In an old storeroom.
But we've no idea how it got there.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.520
I dare say I could work it out.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.880
It has nothing to do with me.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.680
And I'm very sorry
for bringing Mrs. Hallow here.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.440
I was only trying to help.

26:31.200 --> 26:35.040
And it isn't just first-years who find
starting a new school challenging

26:35.840 --> 26:39.080
because some people
can be particularly unwelcoming.

26:45.360 --> 26:50.880
- If it wasn't Miss Mould, then who was it?
- I really don't know, Miss Hardbroom.

26:51.800 --> 26:55.840
But I'm returning it to the foundations
before any more damage is done.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.320
Come on, ladies.

27:01.800 --> 27:05.640
Time to get this academy rebuilt
and shipshape again.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.320
Hmm.

27:09.720 --> 27:10.720
Thank you, girls.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.680
I am so sorry about helping
with the Clone Spell.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.080
Enid, you really should've known.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.880
One Ethel is more than enough.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.960
Sometimes I can be my own worst enemy.
