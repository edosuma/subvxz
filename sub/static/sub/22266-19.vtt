00:02.001 --> 00:03.413
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:03.504 --> 00:06.997
Anatoly said that you had a plan
to take control of the city.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.215
It's like you're firing Overwatch.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.044
I need to stop Diaz.
And in order to do that

00:12.137 --> 00:15.050
I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.257
The impeachment was
just the latest step.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.637
And what's the next one?

00:18.936 --> 00:21.895
Star City, it's open for business.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.013
(BELL TOLLING)

00:32.156 --> 00:33.568
MAN: Get your ass out of bed, <i>chillรณn.</i>

00:34.952 --> 00:37.410
You can look at that picture
all you want.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.195
Your father ain't never
coming back, Diaz.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.497
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:42.042 --> 00:43.123
I'm getting breakfast.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.669
When I come back, this place better
be clean for inspection.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.168
No wrinkles on the bed.
Seriously, or...

00:51.718 --> 00:54.631
You get another souvenir
to help remind you.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.137
If you do it again,
I'll tell Sister Heller.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.059
You think they'll believe
someone like you, <i>chillรณn?</i>

01:04.982 --> 01:05.972
What...

01:07.025 --> 01:08.391
You want to take a shot at me?

01:09.194 --> 01:11.732
Go ahead. I'm right here.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.528
Give it back! That's my only one.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.075
No family's gonna wanna take you in.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.160
Why would they?

01:24.543 --> 01:27.707
You're nothing. You're a loser.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.550
I think you need that reminder now.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.268
You know that they
invited us here, right?

01:49.818 --> 01:52.811
Breaking and entering is a bit
disrespectful, don't you think?

01:52.904 --> 01:54.270
I'm tired of waiting.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.069
You're the one who wanted
to tag along.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.902
To see how you operate,
to see your big job.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.738
So far all we've done is drive in
a car for three hours

02:02.831 --> 02:04.117
and wait outside

02:05.584 --> 02:06.791
for two more.

02:08.336 --> 02:13.173
Patience. It's one of the most
important virtues a person can have.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.416
(CLOSES CAGE)

02:15.886 --> 02:17.093
Meaning?

02:17.638 --> 02:21.598
If you think short-term,
you're gonna drift moment to moment.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.552
If you want something big,
something truly remarkable,

02:26.396 --> 02:27.728
you got to think long-term.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.182
We've been waiting out here
long-term.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.061
Let me put it in perspective.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.276
I've been working on something
for five years.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.028
What's waiting two hours?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.155
A slap in the face?

02:42.871 --> 02:45.659
Small price to pay for
introduction to the Quadrant.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.991
I thought they were an urban legend.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.710
They're very real.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.338
They control all criminal enterprises
across the entire country.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.503
The four corners.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.919
Yeah, "Quadrant," I get it.
Very clever.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.426
They didn't get that type of power
without patience.

03:02.933 --> 03:03.923
Well, if they're so powerful,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.974
then why didn't you
come with any backup?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.929
I'm not. I got you.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.694
You're early.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.617
My father couldn't make it.
You don't mind, do you?

03:26.707 --> 03:27.948
Let's get started.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.957
We have a lot to discuss.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.124
Indeed, we do.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.502
Hey, you made it.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.929
Yeah. Um...

03:45.517 --> 03:48.225
- I did.
- That's great. I'm glad you did.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.557
What's wrong?

03:51.189 --> 03:54.102
It's just been a while since
we've done any Helix Dynamics stuff.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.808
Yeah, well, we've been busy.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.109
We've been fighting.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.897
Not you and me. Our teams, yeah, but
that's not an issue for me anymore.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.654
Glad it's not for you, but you know,
Rene is still in the hospital.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.576
He's only now just getting out.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.238
I'm sorry. About our teams...

04:09.541 --> 04:10.907
I'm sorry.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.705
I'd really like Helix to work.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.377
Looks like you're trying to
stabilize a neural interface.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.541
Yeah, I mean it's just still
really twitchy.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.336
You know,
actually I had a thought about this.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.764
I think the serotonin interface is
a result of the pathogenic reaction.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.343
Star City is open for business.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.181
We have the police, the ports,
the whole city...

04:34.733 --> 04:35.894
We got it wired.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.318
Now, you wanna run merchandise,
you wanna move product,

04:39.404 --> 04:41.236
launder money, anything...

04:43.158 --> 04:44.490
Star City is the place.

04:44.659 --> 04:49.745
Assuming we're interested, not saying
that we are, but assuming,

04:51.333 --> 04:52.824
how much are you looking to charge?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.079
It's free.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.455
(CHUCKLES)

04:57.464 --> 04:59.046
Nothing's ever free.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.086
I just want a seat at the table.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.089
Of the Quadrant?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.461
Mmm-hmm.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.505
That seems reasonable to me.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.801
You make the Quadrant
sound like it's a potluck.

05:11.353 --> 05:14.221
As if there's always room
at our table for anyone

05:14.314 --> 05:16.806
with something to add. (CHUCKLES)

05:17.150 --> 05:18.436
But it's not.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.689
We're a family.

05:22.155 --> 05:27.867
We're not really that welcoming
to outsiders.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.414
At least, not before we know
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:33.875 --> 05:36.458
that you can operate at our level.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.295
I just offered you a whole city.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.879
Hell, if you can't see
the opportunity in that,

05:43.969 --> 05:46.427
why don't I talk to your father?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.049
He sent me.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.683
We're just looking
for a little something extra.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.803
Call it establishing your bona fides.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.226
What did you have in mind?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.814
This is Robert Baylor,
one of our guys. (CLEARS THROAT)

06:03.029 --> 06:04.440
The FBI pinched him.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.276
- That's not ideal.
- Right?

06:07.284 --> 06:11.244
We need to know where the Federal
Marshals are holding Baylor

06:11.329 --> 06:12.615
so we can get him out.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.700
You want him to audition?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.454
Well, that's not a very productive
way of putting it.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.207
- And yet...
- It will be nothing for me.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.082
It's not a problem. Whatever it takes
to get the deal done, right?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.508
Champion mindset. (CHUCKLES)

06:26.887 --> 06:28.594
You got a john in this place?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.011
It's right over there.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.952
(GLASS SHATTERS)

07:12.015 --> 07:15.304
I'm at the location now.
Thanks for the address.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.894
I'd say I owe you one,
but you owe me 20.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.024
He wants contact with the FBI.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.067
So more waiting then.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.237
We have to get a picture of the guy.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.610
Proof of life.

07:32.035 --> 07:36.325
They tell you to fetch, you fetch.
So, what's next? Roll over?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.324
Oh! That's right.
You've already done that.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.122
You think I'm giving in
to these people too much?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.078
I don't think it, I know it.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.836
It's just business.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.466
You're okay with all this?
How that guy talked to you?

07:52.681 --> 07:56.300
Cartier is nothing.
He's a stepping stone.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.394
Long-term thinking, remember?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.971
Yeah, I remember.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.936
How's that working out for you?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.154
Smoke break.

08:16.204 --> 08:20.824
Fetch, roll over, sit. Good boy.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.581
You know that the Quadrant is the
most powerful criminal organization

08:25.672 --> 08:26.708
on the continent?

08:26.798 --> 08:29.836
When I joined with Cayden James,
I gained a city.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.506
When I join the Quadrant,
I'm gonna have an empire.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.733
Okay. Try it.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.230
- Success.
- Yes!

08:52.323 --> 08:55.191
Pathogenic reaction is completely
stabilized. (LAUGHS JOYFULLY)

08:55.368 --> 08:57.280
Yes! Damn, we make a good team!

08:59.164 --> 09:00.746
- Speaking of team...
- No, don't do that.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.243
Why would you do that?
We're having such a good time.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.791
Earlier you said the team thing
wasn't an issue for you anymore.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.791
- Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did. The question is why?

09:08.631 --> 09:11.715
Oliver sort of fired me. I mean,

09:11.801 --> 09:16.045
he's saying that he didn't, but,
it sure feels like he did, you know.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.505
Well, sort of fired... He fired me.

09:17.599 --> 09:21.183
Wait. I'm sorry. What happened?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.969
Long story short, Oliver had a run-in
with Vertigo... The pharmaceutical,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.054
not a person,

09:25.148 --> 09:28.482
and he came out of it with this
epiphany that to stop Diaz he has to

09:28.860 --> 09:29.976
"go back to basics."

09:30.153 --> 09:32.770
- Meaning?
- Meaning he's a lone wolf.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.569
- No more Team Arrow.
- So, did he also fire John?

09:36.743 --> 09:41.158
No. John left about a week before.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.248
Wow! Okay, well...

09:44.334 --> 09:46.792
I am going to have to try not
to take satisfaction out of that.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.244
Try really hard.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.580
Okay, so it was down to
you and Oliver.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.960
- Mmm-hmm.
- Now it's just Oliver.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.124
Yep.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.131
- How are you doing with all this?
- I'm fine.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.133
You're not fine.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.506
What?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.805
So, none of your people
could find him.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.062
I did.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.143
I'll tell him to start
carving the monument.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.770
They brought your boy
out for a smoke.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.315
Looked more like a guest
than a prisoner.

10:17.408 --> 10:21.823
Honey, ease up.
That's a 30-year-old single malt.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.626
Call me "honey" again,
and I might only break your legs.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.622
Mmm.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.057
(WHISPERS) I like this one.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.811
So, I held up my part of the bargain.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.227
Time for you to deliver yours.

10:51.317 --> 10:56.403
You know, your pretty little friend
makes an inconvenient point.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.903
Seems that Mr. Baylor
has gotten a little chatty.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.983
So what?

11:01.077 --> 11:03.160
So, my father's going to have to
debrief him.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.784
You know, to find out what
he told the Justice Department.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.749
- You want me to...
- Fetch him?

11:09.460 --> 11:12.828
What's a little favor between
future business partners?

11:13.214 --> 11:14.580
So, what's next?

11:15.258 --> 11:18.422
You want me to roll over,
you want me to play dead?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.128
You're absolutely right.
Forget I asked.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.009
Thanks for tracking down
Baylor for us.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.757
We'll take it from here.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.559
You should've asked me
from the beginning.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.429
Are you wasting my time?

11:32.984 --> 11:35.442
I don't react well
when people waste my time.

11:35.528 --> 11:41.525
Hey, I had no idea that Baylor would
be cooperating with the Frisbees.

11:41.784 --> 11:42.945
(CHUCKLES)

11:43.244 --> 11:45.156
I'm gonna deliver Baylor to you.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.326
Afterwards, I meet your father.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.414
You solve this little problem for us

11:52.503 --> 11:54.995
and my dad will be asking
to sit down with you.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.341
Call me when you've got Baylor.
I'll send over a car.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.335
Hey,

12:01.971 --> 12:03.178
what happened to your hand?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.925
I got angry at someone.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.850
The Quadrant's making you jump
through a lot of hoops.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.310
I hope it's worth it.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.611
Why don't I knock on the door?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.692
(EXPLOSION)

12:26.120 --> 12:27.656
Hello, boys.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.910
(GRUNTING)

12:56.943 --> 12:58.150
(GUNSHOTS)

13:26.597 --> 13:28.429
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.307
Are you gonna kill me?

13:30.393 --> 13:33.682
If you keep asking me questions.
On your feet.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.934
Send the car.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.772
Move. Move!

13:43.489 --> 13:44.980
(SCREECHING)

13:47.452 --> 13:48.818
Cartiers take care of their own.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.245
Once you're in, you're family.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.742
That's my expectation.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.698
All those days,
I knew they'd send for me.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.242
I would never snitch.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.541
Sure you wouldn't.
I wouldn't take the chairs, though.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.002
You're lucky you don't work for me.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.052
Baylor, buddy.
Feds treat you all right?

14:11.434 --> 14:14.017
Whoa. I didn't say nothing.
I swear to God.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.183
Tell him in person.

30:26.575 --> 30:27.816
Well, that's a relief.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.994
I'm going to send you someplace
far away from here.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.991
To a hospital I own.

30:34.458 --> 30:38.293
They know every way there is to keep
a man alive

30:38.378 --> 30:40.745
as other men carve pieces out of him.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.707
Sure.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.710
Sure, you could go that way.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.132
You could try.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.893
But if you do,
it'll cost you billions.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.561
Annually.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.849
Take him.
But make sure he doesn't die.

31:01.735 --> 31:02.896
Wait.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.853
He killed my boy.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.609
Frankly, I'm surprised your idiot son
made it this far.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.990
Talk as if your life
depended upon it. Because it does.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.074
Like I said,

31:21.129 --> 31:22.916
it wasn't supposed to be this way.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.591
Mr. Cartier's son

31:31.681 --> 31:35.345
was supposed to arrange this meeting
without bloodshed.

31:35.769 --> 31:40.184
But Cartier Sr., he wanted
to go another way.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.765
Because you're not fit to be
in the same room as us.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.275
You're a street thug.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.528
Not even qualified to work on
one of our crews.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.446
I came to this meeting

31:51.284 --> 31:53.742
because I have
a business proposition.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.031
You know what's happening
in Star City, right?

31:58.208 --> 32:01.872
I see it's falling apart.
I've seen chaos.

32:02.212 --> 32:06.047
No, no, no. Controlled chaos.

32:06.508 --> 32:13.256
What you see as dysfunction,
I see a machine

32:14.266 --> 32:16.258
running on full efficiency.

32:18.228 --> 32:24.566
I control the PD, City Hall,
the ports, the rails...

32:25.735 --> 32:31.072
I control everything. And it could
all be yours. All of it.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.112
In exchange for one thing.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.324
One thing.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.037
A seat

32:44.546 --> 32:46.037
at this table.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.254
I don't see an empty chair.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.672
Even if there was one,

32:52.762 --> 32:55.379
I would never sit beside the man
who killed my own blood.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.965
He pushed me to it.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.849
And he pushed and he pushed,

33:03.690 --> 33:04.931
and he pushed.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.984
A man's got his limitations.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.438
And you are mine.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.157
Look at you.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.114
A street thug

33:19.080 --> 33:24.075
who couldn't even keep himself
out of prison. You're nothing.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.712
A loser.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.088
DIAZ: Oh.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.133
Looky here.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.891
That's an empty seat.

33:46.650 --> 33:52.738
We are successful because we're
deliberate, disciplined and precise.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.944
We're not animals killing
each other for scraps.

33:56.409 --> 33:59.197
We are civilized. This is not.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.448
But your proposal intrigues us,
Mr. Diaz.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.788
We'd like to hear more.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.216
(CHUCKLES)

34:22.811 --> 34:24.268
Let's get started.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.533
What's wrong?

34:40.536 --> 34:42.949
You got what you wanted.
You're not a loser anymore.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.452
You are a legitimate crime lord.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.784
And yet, you still seem on edge.

34:47.877 --> 34:51.210
You think a ring and a seat
at the table changes things for me?

34:52.507 --> 34:55.123
I think we ran a gauntlet
because you thought it would.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.253
It's not over yet.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.389
There's still one last thing
I have to care of.

35:50.732 --> 35:51.973
Can I help you?

35:54.736 --> 35:55.852
Oliver?

36:01.743 --> 36:04.861
<i>There are no survivors
in the explosion that consumed</i>

36:04.954 --> 36:07.662
<i>a city block in the Glades
earlier this evening.</i>

36:07.874 --> 36:10.241
<i>Given the power of the blast,
experts say that</i>

36:10.335 --> 36:12.372
<i>forensics may be required</i>

36:12.462 --> 36:14.203
<i>to determine the fate
of the Green Arrow.</i>

36:15.507 --> 36:16.748
Come on.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.175
OLIVER: Hey, you.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.128
- Oh, my God.
- You okay?

36:23.848 --> 36:24.964
Oh, my God.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.388
I saw the explosion on the news

36:28.478 --> 36:30.140
and you were right
in the middle of it.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.267
Yeah. No, I fired a grappling arrow.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.566
It flew backwards,
right out of there. I'm fine.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.019
- Well, I'm not.
- Okay.

36:38.405 --> 36:39.862
Worrying about you out here is...

36:41.241 --> 36:43.608
Well, it's completely different from
worrying about you in the bunker.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.068
Right, because when
you're in the bunker

36:45.161 --> 36:46.777
you feel like
you can make a difference.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.991
I can. I can make a difference.

36:51.084 --> 36:56.250
I can deploy backup. I can do...
I don't know, I can do something.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.455
(VOICE BREAKS) Out here...

37:00.009 --> 37:01.295
I'm helpless out here.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.845
You aren't helpless anywhere. Ever.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.259
And I'm not helpless either.
All right?

37:11.813 --> 37:14.305
I made a promise
to that guy in there.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.349
I would always come back.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.858
William made an excellent point
when he said

37:21.030 --> 37:24.148
you coming back is not always
going to be your decision.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.108
William does make excellent points.

37:26.995 --> 37:31.456
But I made the promise anyway.

37:33.209 --> 37:37.374
I'm making the same promise to you.
Right here, and right now.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.665
Felicity,

37:42.677 --> 37:44.464
I will always come back.

37:51.478 --> 37:52.514
(WHIMPERS)

38:00.445 --> 38:01.811
DIAZ: Let's go.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.562
I've been waiting an hour.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.321
Get up the stairs.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.364
I know you hate waiting.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.417
Who's this?

38:18.713 --> 38:21.000
That last thing
I have to take care of.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.374
I've got kids.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.626
They need me, please. Please.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.463
Don't hurt me. Whatever you want,
I can give it to you.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.720
You're lucky if you got two dimes
to rub together

38:32.185 --> 38:33.551
on a good day.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.516
How do you know me?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.015
(SOFTLY) What?

38:42.570 --> 38:43.686
What?

38:46.449 --> 38:48.156
How do I know you?

38:51.496 --> 38:56.457
I've known you my whole life.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.083
What?

39:00.129 --> 39:04.715
Laurel, meet Jesse Frederico.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.170
Jesse,

39:07.971 --> 39:09.257
meet Laurel.

39:10.390 --> 39:13.007
I don't think people are supposed
to know that Laurel's working

39:13.101 --> 39:14.592
with a crime lord.

39:17.146 --> 39:20.184
"Crime lord." Crime lord.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.730
I love the sound of that.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.198
You really don't remember me?

39:33.079 --> 39:34.411
<i>Chillรณn.</i>

39:38.626 --> 39:39.662
Diaz?

39:42.463 --> 39:43.999
That is really disappointing.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.380
I thought I made a bigger impression.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.296
On your knees.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.013
(GRUNTS)

40:03.192 --> 40:05.354
Hey, what are you doing?

40:07.280 --> 40:08.942
Getting my payback.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.317
(WHIMPERS)

40:13.620 --> 40:16.112
I think that this is
a little bit more than payback.

40:26.633 --> 40:27.623
See that?

40:31.930 --> 40:33.717
I took this from the fire.

40:37.477 --> 40:40.390
I stuck my hand

40:41.564 --> 40:44.056
right in.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.350
I had blisters.

40:47.987 --> 40:51.526
I had raw, cracked skin.

40:54.661 --> 40:55.947
For weeks!

40:59.165 --> 41:00.451
Hey, Jesse.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.992
Hey.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.330
You still like fire?

41:14.347 --> 41:15.633
(CRIES)

41:16.224 --> 41:17.556
Ricardo.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.510
I promised myself

41:22.522 --> 41:24.309
when the time was right

41:27.694 --> 41:29.560
that I'd get my payback...

41:31.698 --> 41:33.234
When I wasn't a loser.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.246
