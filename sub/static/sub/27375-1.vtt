[door opens and closes]

00:53.470 --> 00:56.390
Clara! Right on time.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.184
I know, Mom. I'm so sorry!
The roads are a mess.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.061
They always are this time of the year.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.522
-That's why I asked you to come early.
-[Clara] I know.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.526
-Wow! Mom!
-[Lydia] Hmm?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.861
-[Clara] This is so beautiful.
-[Lydia] Hmm.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.073
I think this is your best one ever.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.616
It has to be.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.327
I'm being featured
in <i>Seasons Magazine </i> for Christmas.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.037
-You are?
-Mm-hmm.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.455
-Wow!
-[Lydia giggles]

01:20.539 --> 01:22.416
-I love these windows.
-[cell phone rings]

01:24.835 --> 01:26.795
-It's Bonnie.
-[Lydia] But of course.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.505
Hey, Bonnie.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.215
Yeah, Bonnie, slow down.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.094
Well, yeah, it's Christmas.
We always get slammed.

01:37.055 --> 01:37.931
Again?

01:40.017 --> 01:43.645
Yeah, sure. I'll be right in.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.689
-[sighs]
-[cell phone beeps]

01:47.482 --> 01:49.276
-Mom.
-Mm-hmm?

01:49.860 --> 01:51.695
I'm really sorry, but I have to go.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.489
You're really wasting
your talents there, sweetheart.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.743
Can we have a rain check
on baking those cookies?

01:57.826 --> 01:58.785
[Lydia] Oh, no!

01:58.869 --> 02:02.331
Your mother waits for no one,
first born or otherwise.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.541
How do you think your father
became so punctual?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.168
[both laugh]

02:07.377 --> 02:08.336
He was pretty punctual.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.005
-Mm-hmm.
-I love you.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.633
-I love you too. Be careful.
-I will.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.011
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.433
[door closes]

02:23.060 --> 02:27.230
Right there. Yes, perfect.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.902
Welcome back
to <i>Can You Stand The Heat!</i>

02:32.235 --> 02:35.155
We started with 50 super celebrity chefs,

02:35.405 --> 02:38.492
and managed to whittle
it down to just three!

02:38.825 --> 02:41.286
So, who's it gonna be?

02:41.828 --> 02:42.996
-Mike Mahoney...
-[audience applauds]

02:43.080 --> 02:44.873
...whose big talent is second only

02:44.956 --> 02:46.083
-to his big mouth?
-Big Mike!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.417
What's that catchphrase?

02:47.626 --> 02:50.587
[all] Let's get cooking!

02:52.005 --> 02:55.300
Mike is in the house, baby!
That's right! Whoo!

02:56.259 --> 02:57.469
[TV hostess] Or Sharl Shaunnessy?

02:58.136 --> 03:01.431
The only baker who has what it takes
to rise to the top.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.559

[audience clapping and cheering]

03:13.360 --> 03:14.361
[audience gasps]

03:14.444 --> 03:17.489
Or will it be Manhattan's
hottest celebrity chef,

03:17.697 --> 03:21.326
restaurateur and bachelor, Shane Roarke?

03:21.410 --> 03:25.705

[Shane chuckles] <i>Huh? Huh?</i>

03:34.881 --> 03:37.968
Let's see it! Let's see!
Ah, ah, ah!

03:38.301 --> 03:40.429
[chuckles] Yeah, there it is!

03:40.929 --> 03:43.140
[clapping and cheering]

03:46.935 --> 03:50.439
Well, we've waited so long
for the best of the best

03:50.522 --> 03:53.817
to slice and dice, and sift it out.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.319
And now for the winner...

03:56.403 --> 03:58.071
[audience cheering]

03:58.947 --> 04:00.198
Sharl...

04:02.743 --> 04:03.744
Oh, man.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.954
You are...

04:07.998 --> 04:10.333
-not the winner!
-Oh, come on!

04:10.542 --> 04:11.585
[mouthing] I'm sorry.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.462
I'm out of here. This is [bleep].

04:13.545 --> 04:14.629
These two wouldn't know the difference

04:14.713 --> 04:16.298
between a puff pastry and a Danish pastry.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.634
<i>See you later, squids. </i> [bleep]

04:20.385 --> 04:24.181
[laughing] <i>What the </i> [bleep].
[laughs] <i> You can't say that on TV.</i>

04:26.057 --> 04:28.435
And this year's

04:28.518 --> 04:31.104
celebrity champion is...

04:45.285 --> 04:47.496

-[clapping and cheering]
-[woman] Oh, my God!

04:50.248 --> 04:51.458
[Clara] Guys?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.212
-Guys?
-[woman] Amazing!

04:56.087 --> 04:58.673
-Oh! He's so inspiring--
-Guys!

04:59.841 --> 05:01.051
If you're looking for something to do,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.220
maybe your jobs
could use a little attention?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.556
Yeah, I know,
but we have a really big day,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
so, we need to get going.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.522
Like now. Thank you.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.609
[indistinct chatter]

05:19.569 --> 05:23.448
Oh, Clara, you might as well
own this place.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.492
Oh, no, I am happy managing.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.119
Yeah, but your restaurant
in Chicago was great.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.997
I mean, I could just imagine
what you'd do to this place.

05:31.623 --> 05:35.252
Well, enough about that.
Let's just worry about these guests.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.337
Shane won!

05:37.629 --> 05:39.589
-Good for Shane.
-Everyone loves Shane.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.259
I have a table of seven coming in.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.760
-Can you please help me set up?
-OK.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.428
-Thank you.
-He's really cute, though.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.596
[Clara chuckles]

05:48.515 --> 05:49.891
[TV hostess]
<i>Remember that name, folks!</i>

05:49.975 --> 05:50.976
Shane Roarke!

05:51.226 --> 05:55.647
He's the country's most famous chef,
and most eligible bachelor.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.567
Breaking eggs...
And breaking hearts.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.277
Shane Roarke, everybody.

-Great. Thank you.
-[Clara] Enjoy.

06:41.818 --> 06:42.694
-Thanks.
-Hey,

06:42.777 --> 06:44.779
when you get a chance, could you run
some garlic bread to table three.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.740
-Absolutely. You're welcome.
-Thank you.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.534
Yeah, just go with the cab. Perfect.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.037
How is everything?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.289
Good. Your server
will be with you in just a minute.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.373
Thank you.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.585
How is everything over here?

07:00.211 --> 07:03.256
Hey! [clapping]
We don't have all day here!

07:03.632 --> 07:05.050
I'll be right there, sir.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.636
-[Bonnie] I'm not 100 percent sure, but...
-What are you doing?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.220
[Bonnie] I think that guy wants you...

07:09.554 --> 07:10.388
You think?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.350
Hey, can I get two glasses
of red please? Thank you.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.143
[clapping]

07:15.477 --> 07:18.104
-Don't clap at the waitress. She's--
-I'm getting it done.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.565
-Shush. I got this one.
-Don't shush me!

07:22.025 --> 07:23.151
How can I help you?

07:24.361 --> 07:28.531
[scoffs] I ordered a rare steak
and it's not bleeding.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.867
Well, you certainly seemed to have enjoyed
the first half of it.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.828
Yeah, but, I didn't love it.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.330
Shouldn't I love my steak...

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
Clara?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.296
Well, I'm afraid I can't guarantee you
love on this steak,

07:43.380 --> 07:46.633
but I can get you a new steak.
Rare, extra bloody.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.635
Touchdown!

07:49.260 --> 07:52.180
Oh, wow. Well, the date is over,

07:52.514 --> 07:56.226
and I am so sorry about... that.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.562
Um... [clears throat] Is there a taxi
stand outside? I'll just...

08:01.314 --> 08:03.066
I'll be back in just a minute.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.362
I bet you're glad to be back, huh?

08:07.946 --> 08:08.863
[Clara] Over the moon.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.502
Ah, I can't wait to get home.
I'm exhausted.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.046
I know. Me too. OK, but first
I gotta use the bathroom.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.174
-Again? You just went to the bathroom.
-Yeah, [scoffs] I gotta go again.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.843
-[phone ringing]
-Have you been stealing

08:29.968 --> 08:31.136
cheese from the kitchen again?

08:31.720 --> 08:32.804
So?

08:33.138 --> 08:36.015
-[laughing] So, you're lactose intolerant.
-No, I'm not.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.267
Cheese just makes my stomach

08:37.350 --> 08:39.269
-gurgle a little bit.
-[Clara] Right. My bad.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.980
-Enjoy your cheese. Yeah. Go.
-Can you hold my bag?

08:52.991 --> 08:55.827
Hi, how are you? I'm just checking in.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.496
-[thud]
-[Clara sighs]

09:04.794 --> 09:06.546
[Shane] Can I help you with this?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.758
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, don't mention it.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.676
-[Clara] This isn't actually my cheese.
-Right.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.179
-Well, this is a nice piece of GruyÃ¨re.
-[Clara sighs]

09:14.387 --> 09:15.805
It's still not mine. It's... um...

09:16.181 --> 09:17.223
-[embarrassed laugh] It's not mine.
-[Shane] A friend's.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.183
Yeah.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.894
-[Clara] Uh...
-[clears throat]

09:22.520 --> 09:23.813
[both sigh]

09:24.147 --> 09:27.609
Anyway, uh... enjoy your stay
at Thunder Mountain.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.319
Thank you, um...

09:29.778 --> 09:31.237
-[both] Clara.
-[Shane clears throat]

09:31.362 --> 09:33.615
Right. It's... on my necklace.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.657
[Shane] It is. Yeah.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.828
-Well, have a good night.
-You too. [chuckles]

09:39.913 --> 09:41.164
Bye. [laughs nervously]

09:48.963 --> 09:51.508
-Do you know who that is?
-Mm-hmm, yup, mm-hmm.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.468
-[excited] It's Shane--
-Shh, shh, shh.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.678
-It's Shane Roarke!
-I know. I know.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.263
You know, from that reality show earlier!

09:57.347 --> 09:59.390
-Yeah.
-He's standing-- [giggling] Here's here!

09:59.808 --> 10:01.935
Oh, he's even more handsome in real life.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.728
Did he make a pass at you?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.816
No, Bonnie, he handed me your cheese.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.111
-[laughs]
-Come on.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.240
[inaudible]

10:16.908 --> 10:17.867
Great.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.328
[phone rings]

10:33.341 --> 10:34.717
[sighs]

11:05.456 --> 11:08.334
Shane Roarke is staying at our resort!

11:08.418 --> 11:10.503
Well, you know,
it's not really our resort.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.297
Oh, do you think
he'll come to the restaurant?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.048
Yeah. He might. He might.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.093
If I were Shane Roarke
and I went to our restaurant

11:17.302 --> 11:19.429
-what would I order?
-Pizza!

11:20.179 --> 11:23.766
Yes! Pizza! I mean,
if he's the perfect man,

11:23.850 --> 11:26.102
which we know he is,
he would get pizza.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.563
[indistinct conversation]

11:30.273 --> 11:31.691
Let's do it!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.822
[engine turning over]

11:41.743 --> 11:42.869
[engine starts]

11:43.620 --> 11:44.621
[Clara] Right.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.415
[indistinct conversation]

11:57.383 --> 11:58.927
[both hooting and hollering]

12:01.346 --> 12:02.388
[Hugh Peters] Guys, right here.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.599
Christmas is just around the corner.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.434
And if Thanksgiving was any indication,

12:06.517 --> 12:09.562
I think we can expect it to be
at least twice as busy this year.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.441
Now, I have a very exciting
announcement to make.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.526
To help with the busy season,

12:15.610 --> 12:17.362
and perhaps some
marketing opportunities,

12:17.654 --> 12:19.238
I've hired a new head chef,

12:19.739 --> 12:20.907
starting today.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.078
He's a huge talent. Shane Roarke.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.205
Come out, buddy!

12:28.331 --> 12:29.457
Oh!

12:33.336 --> 12:36.464
It's Shane Roarke! He's not a guest!

12:36.589 --> 12:39.509
-He's with us!
-Uh-huh. Yup. [chuckles]

12:39.968 --> 12:42.553
Now, I know Shane wanted to get started
meeting all of his staff.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.181
And we all have a lot of work to do
getting ready for Christmas.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.935
So, let's welcome Shane,
and make him feel at home.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.062
Thank you.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.111
-Hi. Clara. We met last night.
-[Shane] Hi.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.904
Of course, yeah. The cheese girl.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.489
Actually, no, I'm cheese girl!

13:02.031 --> 13:03.616
Yeah, I know, that was my purse cheese.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.451
[laughs] But who cares?

13:05.535 --> 13:09.080
I'm Bonnie. And you're Shane.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.498
Hi, Bonnie.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.209
[giggling] Yeah,
Clara was holding my purse.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.586
Oh! Well, that's very nice of her.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.296
-[chuckles]
-[Bonnie] She thinks

13:17.380 --> 13:19.465
I'm lactose intolerant,
but I don't think I am.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.468
Bonnie, remember we talked
about first impressions?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.138
[Shane] OK. Uh, I mean,
that's great to know,

13:25.221 --> 13:27.598
if I'm ever preparing something
for you in the kitchen.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.852
-[all three laugh]
-Yeah.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.479
It was nice to meet you.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.149
Uh-huh. Huh.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.944
-[Clara laughs]
-Wow! No,

13:40.028 --> 13:42.113
that guy needs to take it down a notch
with the flirting.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.032
Yeah? Was he flirting with you?

13:45.450 --> 13:48.036
[Bonnie] Oh! You like him, don't you?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.371
What? Don't be ridiculous.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.623
Oh, you do like him. I can tell.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.585
You know what, I'm going to see
if he likes you.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.794
No, please don't.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.504
-You can count on me.
-[Clara scoffs]

13:58.588 --> 14:00.298
I didn't even say I liked him.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.051
Bonnie!

14:05.094 --> 14:07.055
[inaudible conversations]

14:26.240 --> 14:27.867
[Shane] I'm waiting on that pizza...

14:28.993 --> 14:30.620
How are we doing with those scallops?

14:32.997 --> 14:35.375
[inaudible conversation]

14:43.049 --> 14:44.133
Order's up.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.055
[inaudible conversation]

15:04.946 --> 15:06.739
[waiter] Enjoy your food.
I think you will all love it.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.119
-That was...
-Jeans!

15:11.202 --> 15:12.787
-Excuse me.
-But also skiing too.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.831
It's-- I don't understand
why he does that everytime.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.749
OK. Sorry, I'll be right back.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.001
-It's not fun.
-Have fun with that.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.256
-[giggling and squealing]
-[glasses clinking]

15:23.589 --> 15:26.342
Hello. I'm the manager here.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.719
I heard you asked to see me.
My name is Clara.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.889
How's everything today?
Can we grab you some more drinks?

15:31.973 --> 15:33.933
[sighs] More drinks!
What a great idea, Claire!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.101
-Oh, It's Clara.
-[Janice] Oh!

15:35.435 --> 15:37.353
-Uh, I'm Janice.
-And I'm the other Janice!

15:37.728 --> 15:40.815
Janice and Janice. Two Janices!
[squeals]

15:40.898 --> 15:44.193
We are just a couple of single girls
on vacation here in the mountains.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.487
And we happened to notice
that your new chef is...

15:47.029 --> 15:49.949
-[both] Shane Roarke!
-Oh, I'm afraid I can't really

15:50.074 --> 15:51.033
be much help. I don't know him

15:51.117 --> 15:52.952
-that well--
-We feel like we know him personally.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.789
So, we were wondering
if you could ask Shane

15:56.873 --> 15:58.207
if he'd like to come out and say hello?

15:59.250 --> 16:02.003
I mean, we would love
to meet him. [chuckles]

16:02.128 --> 16:04.130
Oh, sure. I mean, he's pretty busy...

16:04.213 --> 16:06.507
-Thank you!
-Thanks.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.843
-[glasses clinking]
-[Janice] Shane Roarke. She's gonna get...

16:09.510 --> 16:11.721
-[Clara] Shane! Hi.
-Hi.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.055
Um...

16:13.890 --> 16:15.975
-Hi. Clara. Hi.
-Hi. Clara. Hi.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.603
-Yeah, now, we've officially said hi.
-Yeah, we have.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.897
Um, I'm--I'm really sorry to bother you,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.273
but I have a table of young ladies.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.275
They asked if you could drop by
to say hello.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.110
I told them you were busy.
So, I can just--

16:26.360 --> 16:28.404
No, no, no. It's fine.
I'll--I'll head over.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.407
Peters says I'm never too busy
to butter up customers,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.075
so, I'll... I'll head over.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.162
OK. Their names
are Janice and Janice.

16:36.913 --> 16:37.747
I'm sorry?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.041
-Janice and Janice. Yeah.
-Two Janices!

16:40.208 --> 16:41.667
Wow! Sounds interesting.

16:41.918 --> 16:45.379
Yeah, well, they kind of freak me out,
but they're very excited to see you.

16:45.463 --> 16:48.007
Oh, OK. Well, tell them
I'm very excited to see them.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.176
-OK. [laughs]
-OK. Thanks.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.844
-I'll head out.
-[Clara] OK.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.473
[inaudible conversation]

16:56.015 --> 16:57.558
[indistinct conversation]

16:58.893 --> 17:00.061
Good afternoon, ladies.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.231
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.898
-How are you? Shane.
-Janice.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.608
Janice?
Very nice to meet you, Janice.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.609
And?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.279
-Janice.
-[Shane] You're both Janice?

17:11.614 --> 17:14.951
Wow. He is so smooth.
Isn't he smooth, Clara?

17:15.242 --> 17:16.160
Who?

17:16.618 --> 17:21.749
Oh, sure, pretend you don't know.
I'll play along. Shane!

17:23.416 --> 17:24.335
Hang on a second.

17:25.044 --> 17:29.465
Oh, yeah. I guess he's smooth.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.261
Hi, Mr. Peters.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.346
Hi, Bonnie. Clara? Shall we?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.764
[Clara] Sure. I'll be right there, Hugh.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.728
-Hugh?
-Yeah, that's his name.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.439
Really? I thought it was Peters.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.277
You thought he went by mister,
and then his first name?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.279
OK, don't change the subject.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.115
What's he mean, "Shall we?"
Shall we what?

17:54.615 --> 17:57.618
Shall we mind our own business,
maybe? [chuckles]

18:02.790 --> 18:04.125
Mr. Hugh?

18:10.172 --> 18:13.009
All right, guys. Why don't we
take a little bit of a break?

18:13.175 --> 18:14.552
Right? We've got a busy night.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.429
Cool. Good work.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.307
Thank you.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.477
Chef, very nice on the fryer, by the way.

18:23.686 --> 18:24.645
[man] Thanks, chef!

18:27.148 --> 18:28.733
OK, enough about the schedule.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.693
-Yeah.
-I want to talk to you about this project.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.069
What he have...

18:32.570 --> 18:35.197
-[slurping]
-[Shane humming]

18:38.159 --> 18:41.245
-A little soda on the rocks.
-Thank you.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.168
So, you're pretty smooth
over there with your lady fans.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.295
Hmm. Oh, yeah.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.921
They were, uh, they were interesting,

18:51.005 --> 18:53.799
that's for sure. Fun fact,
they're both named Janice.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.676
-[laughs] Wow.
-Yeah.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.804
-That is interesting.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.641
Well, I bet you have
a lot of lady fans, huh?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.477
Argh! Yeah. I guess. [laughs]

19:06.020 --> 19:07.188
OK, I see

19:07.271 --> 19:08.731
-where this is headed.
-What?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.733
I should probably tell you
I have a boyfriend.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.942
Just to be clear.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.861
-Oh! OK. Yeah, thank--
-Yeah.

19:13.944 --> 19:14.987
-Thank you.
-He is, uh...

19:15.071 --> 19:16.155
a city planner.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.115
-His name is Clive.
-Nice.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.326
You know, Bonnie and Clive.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.745
Like <i>Bonnie and Clyde.</i>
Only instead of Clyde it's...

19:22.828 --> 19:24.163
-Clive.
-Clive. Yeah. [laughs]

19:25.748 --> 19:26.791
I mean, that's lovely.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.043
So, what's up with you and Clara?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.170
You guys been friends
a long time, or what?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.506
Oh, best friends
since we were little kids.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.465
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.092
We both grew up here
in Thunder Valley.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.968
I never left, but Clara went to

19:38.052 --> 19:40.471
Chicago for a few years to open up
her own restaurant.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.306
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.516
It was a really nice place, too.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.560
It just didn't quite work out
like she planned, you know?

19:47.144 --> 19:50.606
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know,
Chicago's a tough market.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.069
But anyways, now she's back,

19:55.152 --> 19:57.780
totally alone,
and no boyfriend to speak of.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.198
[Shane chuckles]

20:00.616 --> 20:01.992
So, there's no city planner then?

20:02.118 --> 20:02.952
-No?
-No.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.163
Yeah. Anyone could just ask her out,
and she'd probably say yes.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.957
OK.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.710
Oh, so, what's going on with her
and Peters over there?

20:13.504 --> 20:15.256
[indistinct conversation]

20:16.382 --> 20:17.299
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.718
[Clara laughs]

20:18.884 --> 20:19.802
OK. Now...

20:20.344 --> 20:23.305
Oh! No, there's nothing
going on over there.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.683
-[Clara] Yeah...
-I don't... I don't think.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.533
[door closes]

22:01.946 --> 22:03.948
[footsteps approaching]

22:11.705 --> 22:12.998
[Jackie] They're all one of a kind.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.751
They're gorgeous.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.670
They are.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.756
You should pick your favorite one
and place a bid on it.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.718
You know, every year,
our local artists donate these ornaments,

22:24.802 --> 22:26.887
and then we raffle them off for charity.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.807
That's a tradition started
by Jackie's parents

22:29.890 --> 22:30.808
back in year one.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.351
I see you've met my beautiful wife.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.811
Hi, I'm Jackie.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.771
And I'm the lucky husband, Frank Haven.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.398
[laughing] I'm Shane Roarke.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.317
OK. Shane Roarke.

22:41.151 --> 22:44.530
I'd say, black coffee with half a creamer.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.284
-[Jackie snaps fingers]
-[Frank laughs] Impressed?

22:48.534 --> 22:50.369
Well, young man,
you've seen nothing yet.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.957
Oh, the Mountain View
has been our life for...

22:55.040 --> 22:57.167
-what honey, 22 years?
-Twenty-five years.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.086
Twenty-five years, says the boss.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.671
And believe me, she's always right.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.091
[Jackie] Yes, I am. [chuckles]

23:04.383 --> 23:07.428
So, Shane,
you're not from around here, are you?

23:08.095 --> 23:11.807
No, no. Uh, I'm actually
originally from New York.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.726
-Ah!
-[Shane] And, uh...

23:13.851 --> 23:16.020
I've kind of been roving around
for the last 10 years.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.523
[stammers] And I just took a job over
at the Thunder Mountain resort.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.360
Oh, one of our favorite servers
works up there.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.279
[stutters] It's the Surface, right?

23:25.779 --> 23:27.740
-The Summit.
-Yeah, something like that.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.409
-Yeah.
-[laughs] Her name's Clara Garrison.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.911
Clara. I do know Clara.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.414
She's actually...
she's actually the manager now.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.041
A very good one, at that.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.044
Oh, she's terrific!
She worked here part-time

23:40.127 --> 23:42.296
through high school, and then full-time

23:42.379 --> 23:45.049
for a couple of years
before she went to Chicago.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.009
Jackie and I don't have children
of our own,

23:47.092 --> 23:49.053
so Clara's sort of like a daughter to us.

23:49.803 --> 23:50.888
Right.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.766
So, what brings you from the Summit
to the Mountain View?

23:54.266 --> 23:57.686
Uh... [sighs] history, I guess.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.980
Yeah, I'm kind of...

24:01.023 --> 24:06.278
kind of interested in some of the older,
more family-run resorts in the area.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.199
Well, you've missed the height.
I mean, back in the day,

24:10.282 --> 24:13.577
there were a good dozen or more
just along these mountains.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.121
We're one of the few
that are still scrapping out a living.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.667
It's just so hard to compete
with the big resorts

24:19.750 --> 24:21.293
and the chains anymore, you know.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.545
We still get slammed at breakfast!

24:23.671 --> 24:26.632
Yeah, well, thanks to you.
Without her Eggs Florentine

24:26.715 --> 24:29.134
-we'd be dead and buried by now.
-Really?

24:30.511 --> 24:32.346
You should come by some morning!

24:33.013 --> 24:34.306
Well, I would love that.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.743
[inaudible]

24:58.706 --> 25:01.959
All right. We're still waiting
on one more maple-glazed quail,

25:02.042 --> 25:05.838
a seared trout, and we're going
to do the final beef carpaccio.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.698
-I saw that.
-What look? There was no look.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.867
I didn't say look.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.350
You're still here.

26:00.851 --> 26:04.021
Yeah. Um... I'm just
getting a start on tomorrow.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.230
Nice.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.275
[Shane] Oh, hey, I, um...

26:09.485 --> 26:12.321
I just wanted to say thanks
for helping out tonight.

26:13.322 --> 26:16.825
Oh, yeah, no problem. I mean,
it's better together right?

26:16.992 --> 26:18.494
No, no, no. I know. I know.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.996
But, uh, tonight was crazy busy.
[chuckles]

26:21.288 --> 26:23.499
On top of being
a couple of servers short, so...

26:23.582 --> 26:25.209
-thank you.
-Oh, yeah. Tell me about it.

26:28.045 --> 26:33.425
So, I'm also assuming that you probably
didn't have time for dinner tonight?

26:35.719 --> 26:38.931
No, but that's OK. I can just grab
something on the way home.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.725
Oh, please. What do you mean?
I'm gonna be making something for myself.

26:41.809 --> 26:45.229
You know? I mean, they say
I'm not terrible at this.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.272
-[laughs] That's true. I mean...
-[Shane chuckles]

26:47.439 --> 26:49.316
They actually have been saying
that around here, you know.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.235
-Who's been saying that?
-[both laugh]

26:52.361 --> 26:54.112
-That's a great idea, actually.
-OK.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.573
Um, but you cooked all night.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.034
How about I make us something?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.912
-You?
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.539
-All right.
-Yes?

27:03.622 --> 27:04.957
I'm not going to say no to that.

27:20.013 --> 27:20.889
[Shane] Uh!

27:22.891 --> 27:25.394
Are you sure
I can't help with anything?

27:25.561 --> 27:28.605
Well, if you grabbed a bottle of wine,
I wouldn't complain.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.983
-I mean, I can do that. Yeah.
-[laughs] Yeah?

27:34.862 --> 27:37.072
That just smells really good. I just-- OK.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.365
-I got this.
-All right.

27:53.881 --> 27:54.715
[Shane] Wow!

27:55.591 --> 27:56.842
That was fantastic.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.719
Well, thank you.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.431
You know, they say
I'm not terrible at this.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.726
Mm. [chuckles] I mean, I heard that.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.644
-[laughs]
-Bonnie told me

28:07.728 --> 28:10.856
that you, uh, [clears throat]
had your own place.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.108
-[Clara] She did, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

28:15.861 --> 28:16.695
[Clara] Well...

28:17.821 --> 28:20.866
that turned out to be
a little girl's dream that got too big.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.661
At least you did it, right?

28:25.495 --> 28:26.955
I mean, most people
just sit around dreaming.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.918
Think. Imagine how proud
that little girl would have been

28:31.001 --> 28:32.169
if she saw what you did?

28:34.421 --> 28:35.547
Pretty proud.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.968
No, I took on more than I could handle.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.304
Maybe it was just bad timing.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.765
And, I doubt it.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.976
Yeah, maybe.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.772
Either way, here I am, back at home,

28:51.855 --> 28:55.567
trying to... figure out what's next.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.656
Huh! I mean,
I think chocolate cake's next.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.117
-[chuckles] Chocolate cake?
-Mm-hmm.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.371
Well, that was my other dream.
So, how did you know?

29:07.955 --> 29:09.248
You wanted to be a chocolate cake?

29:09.331 --> 29:10.916
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.626
[both laugh]

29:19.841 --> 29:22.719
Thanks for the company tonight.
It was-- It was really great.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.139
Well, it was my pleasure.
And thank you for cooking.

29:30.686 --> 29:34.940
So... [clears throat]
Can I walk you to your car?

29:36.942 --> 29:41.947
My car... Um, well, it's, uh,
it's currently in the shop.

29:42.447 --> 29:47.327
And, uh, the last bus
left about an hour ago.

29:47.869 --> 29:51.373
So, I've been trying to come up
with like a clever way

29:51.456 --> 29:53.000
to ask for a ride.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.502
I will give you a ride. Yeah.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.753
[Clara] Thanks.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.090
[Clara chuckles]

30:13.312 --> 30:14.396
This is it!

30:14.938 --> 30:18.233
Wow. It's a gorgeous building.

30:19.401 --> 30:20.527
How long have you lived here?

30:21.028 --> 30:25.157
I managed to pick it up
with what I had left after Chicago, so...

30:26.074 --> 30:28.785
I am impressed, Ms. Clara Garrison.

30:29.411 --> 30:33.081
With what? The fact
that I'm not homeless? Or...

30:33.165 --> 30:34.875
-[both laugh]
-Hey, I live in a hotel

30:35.083 --> 30:37.085
and all my belongings are in suitcases,

30:37.169 --> 30:38.253
-so...
-[Clara laughs]

30:39.171 --> 30:42.257
So, you are definitely amazing.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.886
[both laugh nervously]

31:03.195 --> 31:06.823
Wow, I can't believe
I'm kissing a celebrity.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.497
What's wrong?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.458
[stammers] Nothing, nothing, nothing.
I--I just don't-- I don't know

31:16.541 --> 31:18.335
if this is the best idea.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.506
I just get a lot of attention

31:22.589 --> 31:24.591
from the show.
I didn't even know you watched it.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.177
I don't. I don't watch your show.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.765
I was just saying I'm surprised.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.684
Like, in a good way.
I feel really stupid--

31:34.768 --> 31:37.187
Hang on, hang on. I don't think
I'm explaining this right,

31:37.396 --> 31:39.022
-but--
-You're definitely not. You--

31:39.314 --> 31:40.357
Good night, Shane.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.903
-[sights]
-[car door closes]

31:47.864 --> 31:49.282
[exhales]

31:51.243 --> 31:52.619
I am such a jerk.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.811
[inaudible]

32:30.532 --> 32:31.616
Two milks, one sugar.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.660
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

32:34.244 --> 32:35.996
-Are you ready for this morning?
-Hmm...

32:37.247 --> 32:39.291
let me get halfway through
this coffee, and I will be.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.168
Good.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.005
You all right?

32:47.174 --> 32:50.760
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, I'm just ready.

32:51.553 --> 32:52.387
[Hugh] OK.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.265
-It's just up here.
-[Clara] Great.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.730
-There you go. Enjoy.
-[man] Thank you.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.523
Jackie! Sorry to bother you.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.609
Listen, Frank was right.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.778
Those were the best Eggs Florentine
I have ever had.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.197
[chuckles] Really?

33:10.322 --> 33:12.532
Ever. And I happen
to be an expert on eggs.

33:12.824 --> 33:13.700
Are you, now?

33:13.950 --> 33:16.745
Just a little bit. And I'm gonna have
to get that recipe from you.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.539
I taste the smoked cayenne,
but is that mustard powder in there?

33:20.207 --> 33:21.583
You must put a little pinch--

33:21.666 --> 33:25.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm afraid
that is a trade secret.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.714
-[both laugh]
-OK, I'm not gonna ask.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.132
[Jackie] More coffee?

33:29.508 --> 33:32.093
Actually, I... I should get going to work.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.428
Well, could I grab a coffee to go?

33:33.512 --> 33:34.930
-Of course.
-Actually,

33:35.263 --> 33:37.390
can I get two coffees to go, please?

33:38.391 --> 33:40.769
-Coming right up.
-[Shane] Thank you.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.746
That's Shane's car, isn't it?

34:00.956 --> 34:02.249
[Clara] Uh, I don't know.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.802
[indistinct chatter]

34:18.139 --> 34:19.641
[chairs clattering]

34:20.433 --> 34:21.560
Hi.

34:21.935 --> 34:24.521
-Well, aren't we lucky to find you here!
-[Shane] Janice, Janice. Hi.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.607
You know ladies, I...
I was actually just on my way out.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.525
-Oh, come on.
-Yeah.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.527
Are you too good
for a second breakfast?

34:30.944 --> 34:32.779
-[both laugh and squeal]
-[door bell jingles]

34:33.280 --> 34:34.947
[indistinct conversation]

34:37.826 --> 34:39.536
-So...
-What'd you have for breakfast?

34:40.328 --> 34:42.496
[stammers] Uh, I did the Eggs Florentine.

34:42.956 --> 34:46.251
-[Jackie] Clara! How good to see you!
-Jackie! Aw!

34:46.835 --> 34:49.379
I always save a hug for Frank.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.547
-[Frank] Hi!
-Hi!

34:50.964 --> 34:52.465
Jackie, Frank. This is Hugh Peters.

34:52.549 --> 34:53.800
He owns the restaurant I work at.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.678
Oh, that's right.
[stutters] The something or other.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.722
-[Hugh] The Summit.
-[Frank] Yeah, sounds about right.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.765
-Yeah.
-[laughing] It's a pleasure to meet you.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.603
Clara, you were right.
This place is charming.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.439
Guys, could we get
a couple minutes after breakfast?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.774
We have a proposal
we'd like to run by you.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.236
A proposal! I haven't had one
of those since Frank's.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.195
Turned out pretty good.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.114
-[Clara laughs]
-[Frank] I pay her to say that.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.616
-[all laugh]
-Just sit down,

35:17.699 --> 35:19.659
and--and we'll be with you
right after the rush, OK?

35:19.784 --> 35:21.703
-[Hugh] Can wait. Can wait.
-OK. Would you like coffee?

35:21.786 --> 35:22.829
[both] Yes, please.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.081
-[Hugh] This way.
-[Clara] Thank you.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.257
[women giggling]

35:34.424 --> 35:37.636
Uh, [stammers] it's so nice
to see you guys again.

35:37.719 --> 35:38.970
-[Janice] Really?
-[Shane] Really. Yeah.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.972
You're-- Huh, no, no, I... [chuckles]

35:41.056 --> 35:42.641
-So, you're a Pisces and we're...
-[Shane] I am.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.559
-[Janice continues indistinctly]
-Hmm.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.227
[Shane] What month is Pisces?

35:46.311 --> 35:47.854
[Frank] All right.
This will get you started.

35:47.937 --> 35:48.938
-[Clara] Thank you.
-[Frank] OK.

35:49.022 --> 35:49.898
[Shane] June is Gemini.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.484
So, if you could eat 10 pounds of food
what'd it be?

35:52.817 --> 35:55.612
Ten pounds?
Uh... probably wings.

35:56.154 --> 35:56.988
What is it?

35:57.906 --> 35:58.740
Nothing.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.285
[indistinct conversation]

36:02.535 --> 36:03.995
I figured you might be hungry.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.539
-Aw. Thank you.
-Thank you.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.545
Wow, you were right, Clara.
This smells incredible.

36:12.629 --> 36:13.505
I told you.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.009
Dig in.

36:18.968 --> 36:22.472
You know, ladies. I, um,
I actually really do have to go.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.391
Oh, great idea!

36:24.474 --> 36:26.601
-We're moving the party, Janice.
-OK. One car or two, Shane?

36:27.394 --> 36:30.146
-I, uh...
-One, two. We'll figure it out!

36:30.230 --> 36:31.648
-Yeah. OK.
-Oh! OK.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.483
[indistinct conversation]

36:35.276 --> 36:36.444
Oh, honey.

36:39.906 --> 36:43.076
-So, we'll see you again soon.
-I-- I'll be back before you know it.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.494
I hope so.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.955
If you guys have any questions,
please call me.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.249
I'd be happy to go over anything
to help you decide.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.918
I'll look at it, and then
Jackie will make the decision.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.212
Oh, come on. Not just me!

36:54.379 --> 36:57.048
Lovely meeting you both.
Hope to hear from you soon.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.802
If our Clara's involved,
I'm sure it'll work out.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.055
[Jackie] Oh, that reminds me.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.766
We met somebody else
who works at the resort.

37:06.850 --> 37:07.726
Oh, yeah. Shawn.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.269
-What--What was his last name?
-It's not Shawn.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.646
It's Shane. Shane Roarke.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.772
That sounds about right. Yeah.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.774
Oh, so, he was just here for breakfast?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.026
No, actually he came by yesterday.

37:17.944 --> 37:18.903
Oh!

37:21.281 --> 37:24.659
Anyway, thank you both, so much.
I'll see you soon.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.578
-Have a good time, darling. Bye.
-Bye-bye.

37:28.204 --> 37:31.583
-Shawn? Shane. Shane. Damn!
-No. It was Shane!

37:36.296 --> 37:39.257
Everybody! As you know,
tonight the restaurant will be closed

37:39.340 --> 37:40.884
for our annual charity dinner.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.635
It's all in the spirit
of Christmas, of course,

37:42.719 --> 37:45.096
but if it happens to throw
a little publicity our way,

37:45.513 --> 37:46.347
so, be it.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.390
[whispering] Don't look now,

37:47.474 --> 37:50.518
but someone's throwing you
some major eye attention.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.023
Let's do some good!

37:58.985 --> 38:00.487
...like when you play basketball,

38:00.737 --> 38:02.864
you might play hard. Use some elbow.

38:03.072 --> 38:03.907
Ah, yeah.

38:03.990 --> 38:04.908
You should go on them easier.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.249
[cell phone beeps]

38:13.333 --> 38:14.542
Call Clara.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.214
[cell phone rings]

38:19.547 --> 38:22.258
-Hey, Mom, you're on speaker.
-Hi, Mrs. Garrison.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.637
Hello, Bonnie, darling.
Clara, I've called to remind you

38:25.720 --> 38:26.971
<i>of our family Christmas dinner.</i>

38:27.180 --> 38:29.974
Yes, it is on my radar
and scheduled in.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.477
Will you be bringing someone
other than Bonnie this year?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.855
Actually, Clive and I
are doing Christmas this year.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.982
Good for you!

38:38.316 --> 38:40.276
Mom, you know I'm too busy to date.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.320
So, you're down one Bonnie
and stuck with me.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.404
[Lydia] <i>Mm.</i>

38:43.571 --> 38:45.949
I seem to recall your baby sister
making time for Barry

38:46.241 --> 38:48.785
<i>-while she was at Harvard.</i> 
-Mom!

38:48.952 --> 38:50.870
I'm just saying. Just saying.

38:52.038 --> 38:52.956
Mom, I've got to go.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.708
-All right. Just be on time.
-[Clara] <i>I will.</i>

38:55.792 --> 38:57.293
-Bye.
-[Clara] <i>Bye.</i>

38:59.295 --> 39:00.129
Nice.

39:00.922 --> 39:03.716
[Bonnie laughs] Got to love it.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.801
[Clara] Mm-hmm.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.874
Perfect. Thank you.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.962
I managed to sneak you
another chocolate raspberry truffle.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.506
Oh, you devil. Oh, it's so good.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.216
-Thank you.
-[Clara] My pleasure.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.218
The food is better than ever this year.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.803
Well, we have a new chef.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.765
Oh, fantastic! Honestly, though,
the best part isn't the food.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.058
The best part is seeing you guys again.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.435
[both] Aw.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.395
-We look forward to seeing you every year.
-Oh, it's so nice.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.271
Yeah.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.189
So, are you seeing anyone?

40:01.065 --> 40:02.483
-[Hugh] Clara!
-Speaking of seeing...

40:03.151 --> 40:04.193
[Clara] I'll be right back.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.489
I would love for you to meet
my rock star manager Clara.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.325
She is one of a kind.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.910
-[male guest] Clara.
-Nice to meet you.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.412
-Clara, nice to meet you.
-Are you having a great time?

40:16.331 --> 40:17.624
[indistinct conversation]

40:18.625 --> 40:20.460
I'll just gonna check in the kitchen,
and make sure everything is OK.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.461
-Absolutely.
-Great. I'll be back.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.179
And I'm an idiot.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.777
Clara? [clears throat]

40:46.486 --> 40:47.487
Yeah?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.407
Do you mind if I just have a quick word?

40:54.160 --> 40:56.245
I saw you at the Mountain View
this morning...

40:56.913 --> 40:58.790
with those two girls that came in.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.502
[laughs] No, no. OK, I don't know
what you think you saw,

41:02.585 --> 41:04.003
-but it definitely wasn't--
-Hey,

41:04.837 --> 41:06.923
-you don't need to explain yourself to me.
-No, no, I was just eating,

41:07.006 --> 41:09.092
and they forced me to sit with them.
I didn't have a choice.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.135
Yeah, you looked really trapped.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.889
Argh. I don't--I don't want to fight.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.393
I really just came over
to talk to you about the other night.

41:19.978 --> 41:20.979
Please.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.817
Thank you. I...

41:28.194 --> 41:30.196
I wanted to talk to you about, um...

41:32.407 --> 41:34.617
your car. Uh, has...

41:34.784 --> 41:37.078
has the mechanic
gotten back to you at all?

41:38.913 --> 41:42.917
Yeah. It was a problem
with the alternator.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.586
-It'll be ready in a few days.
-OK, great.

41:46.546 --> 41:49.382
Uh, I mean, not--not great.
But I was wondering

41:49.465 --> 41:51.134
if--if you... needed a...

41:52.135 --> 41:54.053
I was gonna offer to take you home

41:54.345 --> 41:56.472
-after work tonight-- OK. Right.
-I'm good.

41:59.308 --> 42:02.186
I guess Mr. Peters can give you
a ride home then?

42:04.230 --> 42:06.357
-You know, Shane...
-Yeah?

42:06.441 --> 42:10.153
However I decide to get to work,
whether I walk or take the bus,

42:10.236 --> 42:11.320
or get a ride with Peters,

42:11.404 --> 42:14.866
-is really none of your business.
-You know, I know, I know. You're right.

42:14.949 --> 42:15.867
You're right-- right, of course.

42:15.950 --> 42:20.288
Look. Please. This isn't... [chuckles]
this isn't how I saw this going.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.999
I just...
Can you just let me explain

42:23.207 --> 42:24.792
why I got freaked out the other night?

42:25.293 --> 42:28.755
That's not necessary
because you were pretty clear.

42:28.838 --> 42:30.048
No, I wasn't. Look...

42:30.840 --> 42:33.718
a celebrity chef isn't something
I ever saw myself becoming.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.887
And I... I misjudged you rudely,

42:36.387 --> 42:39.015
and I just really
would like to be able to...

42:39.348 --> 42:41.017
explain myself properly.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.145
Would you...

42:45.438 --> 42:47.356
would you want--want to
come back to my place

42:47.940 --> 42:48.900
after we're done here tonight?

42:50.443 --> 42:52.487
Because you--you cooked for me. Right?

42:52.570 --> 42:55.364
And it was--it was amazing.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.825
And I would just like to return the favor.

42:58.910 --> 43:03.331
I... I mean, eventually I'll have to,
it might not be tonight, or...

43:05.666 --> 43:06.501
Please?

43:09.796 --> 43:10.713
Yeah.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.382
Sure.

43:14.675 --> 43:15.885
Dinner would be great.

43:17.637 --> 43:18.888
-Great.
-[Bonnie] Great.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.434
I wasn't eavesdropping.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.063
[both chuckle]

43:33.486 --> 43:37.156
So, you, uh, you live in a resort?

43:37.240 --> 43:38.533
-[laughs] Yeah.
-[Clara chuckles]

43:38.616 --> 43:41.369
Uh, I mean, you know,
it's--it's only temporary.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.121
It's not home or anything.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.457
I do hear they have great room service.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.000
Oh, do they?

43:50.128 --> 43:51.295
I'm just kidding.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.548
Everything looks and smells amazing.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.008
Uh, can I help you with anything?

43:56.092 --> 43:57.927
Actually I do have a job for you.
Two jobs.

43:58.302 --> 44:01.848
Number one, is I want you to relax.

44:03.224 --> 44:05.017
And number two is to enjoy yourself.

44:06.602 --> 44:07.979
So, are you relaxed?

44:09.313 --> 44:10.731
-Yes.
-[Hugh] Good.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.943
And are you enjoying yourself?

44:16.028 --> 44:16.863
I am.

44:18.239 --> 44:21.659
-[Clara] Oh! Are you OK? [laughs]
-[Shane] Uh, OK.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.412
And it's really hot. Actually, I'm just...

44:24.912 --> 44:25.913
One second.

44:26.581 --> 44:27.665
Gonna, um...

44:28.249 --> 44:29.125
And...

44:29.584 --> 44:30.543
I...

44:32.295 --> 44:33.880
Anyway, I'm going to... I'll be back.

44:36.424 --> 44:37.300
[chuckles]

45:08.998 --> 45:10.082
What a view.

45:11.876 --> 45:12.752
It is.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.048
I was talking about the mountain.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.217
And the snow.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.970
And the Christmas lights.

45:24.013 --> 45:25.348
I wasn't.

45:37.443 --> 45:38.527
[breathless] Oh, boy.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.906
Is that a good "Oh, boy"
or a bad "Oh, boy"?

45:44.033 --> 45:46.953
It's just the last time we kissed...

45:50.206 --> 45:51.165
[sighs]

45:53.501 --> 45:55.086
I've been on exactly...

45:56.087 --> 45:57.213
five dates.

45:59.507 --> 46:02.385
Three terrible ones, one crazy,
and... [chuckles]

46:03.260 --> 46:05.846
one more that lasted for eight years.

46:07.598 --> 46:10.393
Wow! That is a long date.

46:13.229 --> 46:16.607
You know, the show made me
kind of look a certain way.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.652
But the truth is, I'm not.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.948
I'm not that guy.
I'm not even close to that guy.

46:26.158 --> 46:27.493
Uh, so, when I meet someone now,

46:27.576 --> 46:29.787
they usually expect that person
that I'm not.

46:33.582 --> 46:36.585
You know I'm not that person. Right?

46:38.129 --> 46:39.046
I do.

46:41.841 --> 46:44.427
That's exactly why I wanted you
to come up here.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.055
Because I wanted to apologize.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.433
For misjudging you.

47:00.234 --> 47:02.528
You know, I didn't even like your show.

47:05.114 --> 47:07.825
-Oh, come on.
-I only saw it twice and...

47:08.701 --> 47:10.828
personally, I wanted the other guy to win.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.121
Are you kidding?

47:12.913 --> 47:16.250
That guy microwaved his steak.

47:17.126 --> 47:18.085
Microwaved!

47:18.169 --> 47:19.879
-What!?
-It's blasphemy!

47:45.613 --> 47:46.572
So...

47:47.740 --> 47:49.158
what brought you here, anyway?

47:49.992 --> 47:52.703
I mean, it couldn't have just been
the job offer.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.582
No, you're right, it wasn't.

47:58.584 --> 48:02.463
When I finished the show,
I made myself a promise.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.256
Hmm.

48:04.465 --> 48:06.425
And being here is part of the promise?

48:06.926 --> 48:07.760
Mm-hmm.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.512
It is.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.431
And how long do you plan on staying?

48:13.724 --> 48:15.768
I mean, my contract's for six months.

48:16.435 --> 48:18.270
But I am...

48:19.146 --> 48:22.399
currently working on something
that might keep me here

48:23.109 --> 48:25.903
a little bit longer. Mm-hmm. Maybe.
-Oh?

48:26.737 --> 48:28.614
I still got to do
a little bit more research first.

48:28.697 --> 48:32.493
Mm. Well, aren't you mysterious?

48:32.743 --> 48:33.702
No.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.624
I want to know more about you.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.501
-Me.
-Mm-hmm.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.629
Well, I mean, you already know about me.

48:45.506 --> 48:48.384
I'm a recovering failure.

48:49.635 --> 48:51.428
Failing doesn't mean you're a failure.

48:52.972 --> 48:54.140
Unless you give up...

48:56.475 --> 48:57.935
I don't think that's you.

48:59.061 --> 48:59.937
Mm-mmm.

49:00.271 --> 49:01.397
-No?
-Mm-mmm.

49:02.982 --> 49:04.191
So, who am I?

49:05.776 --> 49:09.905
You are strong, determined.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.284
You're definitely smart.

49:14.618 --> 49:18.164
And you are... exceedingly beautiful.

49:18.539 --> 49:20.166
[both chuckle]

49:20.624 --> 49:23.627
Well, I mean,
feel free to go on. You're...

49:24.461 --> 49:26.422
-spot on so far.
-Am I?

49:28.048 --> 49:30.134
Oh, OK, all right. Um...

49:32.928 --> 49:34.471
you want a place of your own.

49:36.599 --> 49:39.894
You want to build it, and watch it grow.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.438
If I had to guess,

49:43.647 --> 49:45.441
I'd say that you are...

49:45.858 --> 49:47.776
planning on opening your own place again.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.361
-Hmm.
-Mm-hmm?

49:50.738 --> 49:53.282
Well, I mean, I've thought about it.

49:53.324 --> 49:54.408
Ah-ha.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.038
Whatever it is...

50:01.624 --> 50:02.583
you will do it.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.628
And it's going to be yours.

50:08.047 --> 50:09.006
And it's going to be great.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.300
[chuckles]

50:14.428 --> 50:16.347
Hey, you don't think it's gonna be
a problem with Mr. Peters

50:16.430 --> 50:17.848
if you keep coming over here, do you?

50:19.266 --> 50:20.643
Mr. Pete--
-Yeah.

50:20.726 --> 50:22.561
-Like me and Peters?
-You and Hugh, yeah.

50:24.313 --> 50:26.857
No, no, we're-- that's-- that's just...

50:27.066 --> 50:28.567
-It's business.
-Oh, is it?

50:28.651 --> 50:30.110
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah? Yeah?

50:31.028 --> 50:32.613
Are you working on something big?

50:33.530 --> 50:36.742
Well, I mean, I promised
I wouldn't say anything.

50:36.909 --> 50:40.079
Ah, well, aren't you the mysterious one.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.539
Just a little.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.424
["Sounds Like Christmas"
by Keith Cooper playing]

52:21.347 --> 52:23.349
-Thank you.
-Here you go. Enjoy.

52:23.432 --> 52:24.350
Thank you.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.520
-You really like him, don't you?
-[Clara chuckles]

52:29.229 --> 52:30.939
I think I do. Yeah.

52:32.900 --> 52:36.195
OK. Well, when I first met Clive
I thought he was the most boring person

52:36.278 --> 52:37.237
in the entire world.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.406
You know, I almost didn't go
on a second date with him.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.034
But then I realized, after a while,

52:42.159 --> 52:43.994
he wasn't boring at all.
He was just shy.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.414
Of course, most city planners
are so boring.

52:47.831 --> 52:48.749
[Clara] No.

52:49.333 --> 52:51.585
-You don't say. [chuckles]
-[Bonnie] No, I--I do say.

52:52.378 --> 52:55.214
But the fact is, Clive is the--
He just is the funniest,

52:55.297 --> 52:57.216
most exciting city planner
I have ever met.

52:57.299 --> 53:00.260
And I feel really lucky
I gave him a chance.

53:00.803 --> 53:02.096
I really like Clive.

53:02.554 --> 53:03.472
Me too.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.600
No, I know
Shane isn't a city planner or anything.

53:07.059 --> 53:09.770
-But I guess famous chefs can be fun, too.
-[Clara chuckles]

53:11.313 --> 53:14.066
Yeah, I guess they can.

53:15.692 --> 53:18.529
Well, here's to chefs
and city planners.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.202
You know the craziest thing?
Guess what he [stutters] ordered?

53:26.537 --> 53:27.788
-What?
-Carrots.

53:27.955 --> 53:30.749
Really? I thought he was gonna order
some kind of deer.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.210
-I don't know...
-He would never!

53:33.710 --> 53:34.920
-Clara?
-Yeah.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.588
Can I see you in my office
for a minute, please?

53:36.672 --> 53:37.589
Oh, yeah, sure.

53:40.342 --> 53:43.387
Oh, oh. The principal's office.
Somebody's in trouble.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.097
Oh, you didn't hear?

53:45.681 --> 53:46.765
I am trouble.

53:48.392 --> 53:49.476
Yes, you are!

53:53.355 --> 53:54.231
Hey.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.693
Shut the door if you don't mind
and have a seat.

53:58.152 --> 53:59.278
[door closes]

54:03.157 --> 54:05.742
I see that you've been spending
a lot of time with Shane lately.

54:07.744 --> 54:10.289
Yes, my own personal time.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.082
Is that a problem?

54:12.458 --> 54:14.460
No, no, not per se.

54:14.543 --> 54:18.797
I just-- I wonder if you've had enough
free time to work on our little proposal.

54:19.173 --> 54:21.216
I mean, have you even spoken
to the Havens lately?

54:22.092 --> 54:25.345
Yes, actually! Um, I see them
almost every day at breakfast.

54:25.512 --> 54:28.515
Oh. OK. Um...

54:30.601 --> 54:33.604
You know, I--I, uh...
I got you something.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.150
What? What is this?

54:38.567 --> 54:40.027
It's just a little Christmas present.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.488
Oh, Hugh.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.032
I didn't get you anything.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.326
Don't be silly. Just--just open it.

54:51.914 --> 54:52.998
[Clara chuckles]

54:54.291 --> 54:56.460
Wow. This is beautiful.

54:58.754 --> 55:00.130
I don't know what to say.

55:01.965 --> 55:02.966
Thank you.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.010
You deserve it, Clara.

55:05.511 --> 55:07.221
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

55:07.763 --> 55:10.098
And if this deal goes through,
you can buy jewelry yourself

55:10.182 --> 55:11.808
that'll make that look like a knock-off.

55:12.726 --> 55:16.438
But... if you could encourage them,

55:17.147 --> 55:18.774
maybe speed things up.

55:18.857 --> 55:21.109
I'd love to get the deal done
before the year end.

55:21.860 --> 55:23.153
Before New Yearâs?

55:25.113 --> 55:26.240
Um...

55:27.908 --> 55:31.286
Uh, I think they were kind of hoping
for a bit of time with this.

55:32.204 --> 55:34.206
Ah.

55:35.207 --> 55:37.960
All right. This, um,
this was supposed to be a surprise,

55:38.043 --> 55:41.380
but I was hoping to close the deal
sooner because...

55:42.297 --> 55:45.050
I have a project that I want
to send you to New York for.

55:46.426 --> 55:47.302
New York?

55:48.220 --> 55:50.681
Like you want me to oversee
another acquisition or...

55:50.806 --> 55:53.559
Actually, I want to invest
in a new restaurant.

55:54.434 --> 55:56.186
It would be yours. Ours.

55:57.062 --> 55:58.855
But because I'm here
doing the Haven deal,

55:59.439 --> 56:00.440
if we speed it up,

56:00.524 --> 56:02.943
that would open up
the New York opportunity for you.

56:04.152 --> 56:06.530
Yeah! Wow!

56:07.990 --> 56:08.907
It's great.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.621
You know what? Leave it to me.

56:15.122 --> 56:18.458
They trust me and I think I can help
speed them along.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.545
-I know you can.
-You can count on me.

56:22.379 --> 56:25.257
Good. Uh, so?

56:26.925 --> 56:28.260
Yeah, uh, the schedule.

56:28.343 --> 56:32.472
It's just Bonnie's Thursday,
we need to switch it...

56:46.236 --> 56:48.739
-Oh, hi, there!
-Hi. Here.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.240
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.956
So, I've been meaning to ask.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.250
Um... what are you doing
for Christmas?

57:01.418 --> 57:02.794
I don't know. I haven't, uh,

57:03.378 --> 57:05.672
I haven't really thought about it.
I might--I might go back to the city.

57:06.465 --> 57:07.549
Hmm.

57:08.216 --> 57:09.176
Hmm-hmm.

57:10.135 --> 57:11.011
Well, that makes sense.

57:11.094 --> 57:13.221
I'm sure you probably want
to see your family.

57:13.305 --> 57:14.765
[both chuckle]

57:15.849 --> 57:17.893
Have you told me about your family yet?

57:19.394 --> 57:21.021
You know, I don't think I have.

57:22.648 --> 57:26.193
-Do you have brothers or sisters?
-No. No, just me.

57:26.818 --> 57:28.362
Oh, you're an only child.

57:28.487 --> 57:29.571
[both chuckle]

57:29.696 --> 57:34.826
-Oh, now everything makes complete sense.
-What is that supposed to mean?

57:35.285 --> 57:36.328
You mean I'm weird?

57:36.453 --> 57:38.330
No, I'm just kidding.

57:40.082 --> 57:42.125
But I suppose it's all the more reason

57:42.209 --> 57:44.211
you should go home
and see your parents, right?

57:45.587 --> 57:46.505
Yeah.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.011
-What?
-I want to tell you something.

57:53.887 --> 57:54.721
OK.

57:56.264 --> 57:58.475
I'm not supposed to say
anything, but, um...

57:59.601 --> 58:01.311
I'd really like to share this with you.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.107
[stammers] I'm all ears.
I can keep a secret.

58:05.691 --> 58:08.318
OK. So, you know the project
that Peters and I

58:08.402 --> 58:10.612
-have been working on? Right?
-Hmm.

58:10.862 --> 58:12.364
Well, it has to do with the Mountain View.

58:13.031 --> 58:14.282
-Really?
-Yeah.

58:14.324 --> 58:17.411
He wants to buy them out and renovate it

58:17.494 --> 58:20.580
and turn it into this beautiful
upscale boutique hotel.

58:20.956 --> 58:22.916
And, of course, we would keep
Jackie and Frank on,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.461
but the best part is...
is I would be running it for six months.

58:27.337 --> 58:28.255
OK.

58:28.797 --> 58:31.800
No, this is more than OK.
I mean, this is huge for me.

58:32.134 --> 58:33.677
I'd be overseeing everything.

58:33.760 --> 58:37.723
And then today, he told me
that if I could speed this deal along,

58:38.181 --> 58:39.850
he wants to send me to New York.

58:41.601 --> 58:43.186
Yeah, but Peters got you involved

58:43.270 --> 58:45.605
because of your connection
to the Havens, is that right?

58:48.567 --> 58:52.904
Well, I'd like to think
it's because of my experience,

58:52.988 --> 58:56.408
but, yeah,
the Havens are like family to me.

58:56.908 --> 58:57.993
They trust me.

58:58.744 --> 59:00.454
Of course. Of course they trust you.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.331
But do you trust Peters?

59:06.168 --> 59:08.378
Why are you being so negative about this?

59:09.504 --> 59:10.839
I thought you'd be happy for me.

59:10.922 --> 59:12.257
No, no, no, it's not that
I'm not happy for you.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.842
I'm happy for you. I'm just...

59:14.926 --> 59:18.472
Look, when I first took the job here,
I made a couple of calls.

59:19.097 --> 59:22.059
And Hugh doesn't exactly have

59:22.142 --> 59:23.518
-the best reputation.
-[Clara scoffs]

59:24.227 --> 59:25.187
What?

59:27.147 --> 59:29.733
So, you can sign a big fat deal with him,
and I can't?

59:29.858 --> 59:32.986
No, I just work for the guy.
All right? It's only temporary.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.573
[scoffs] I'm so glad I told you this.

59:36.656 --> 59:39.367
Clara, I'm sorry. It's not...
it's not what I mean. I'm just saying...

59:40.035 --> 59:43.663
that whatever he tells you
about this property

59:43.747 --> 59:48.376
or anything, you--you can't just assume
it to be true, right?

59:48.460 --> 59:50.045
You got to take it with a grain of salt.

59:50.170 --> 59:51.129
[Clara sighs]

59:52.130 --> 59:54.049
But did you ever think
maybe this is all happening

59:54.132 --> 59:55.592
because I'm actually good at my job?

59:55.675 --> 59:56.593
[Shane] No, you are!

59:56.927 --> 59:58.345
You're most certainly good at your job,

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.305
but I'm just saying
you might still have blinders on

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.765
because of what happened
to you in Chicago.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.393
OK, I'm sorry. That's not...
that's not what I meant.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:08.146
What I meant to say is he might not be
being honest with you.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.606
And I just want to look out for you.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.108
OK?

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.903
I told you this
because I was really excited.

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:18.365
I don't need your approval.
I can take care of myself.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.450
Clara, listen! Clara! Please!

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.160
Merry Christmas.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:52.023
[Lydia] Oh, she is just the cutest!

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.608
Does she have her daddy's eyes or what?

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:55.902
-[Darlene] Yes, she does.
-[Lydia and Barry laugh]

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:58.947
I just want to say how thankful I am

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.075
to have all of our loved ones
together for Christmas.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.368
Yes, baby.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:06.663
This was always
your father's favorite time of year,

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.123
and not just because of the slopes!

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:12.169
But nothing made him happier
than having us all together.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.381
Maybe next year we'll have a full house.
Right, Clara?

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.842
[all laugh]

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.010
I'm kidding.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.678
To family.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.388
[all] To family!

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.473
[Lydia] Cheers!

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:33.231
Darlene, would you lead us in prayer?

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.608
-I'd love to.
-OK.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.737
Dear Lord,
thank you for bringing us together

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.779
during this special time.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.073
For blessing us
with all this delicious food

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.326
to nourish our bodies.
In the Lord's name,

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:45.827
-Amen.
-[all] Amen!

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:46.870
[Lydia] Thank you, darling.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.371
All right, let's dig in.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.707
Barry, would you do us the honors?

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:51.917
-Yes, I would.
-[Lydia] Thank you.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:55.545
[Lydia coddles, chuckles]

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.214
[Lydia] So, Darlene,

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.798
any exciting new cases?

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.301
I just started a new case.
It's been very busy. Yes.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:04.429
So, I can't say too much about it
right now, but, yeah.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.223
[Lydia] And where are my pictures
of the baby?

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.516
[Darlene] We--We have one for you.
Don't you worry.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.895
Yeah. We got lots of photos.
So, yeah.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.438
-It's good.
-[Lydia] I'm so proud of you.

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.657
[Lydia] Oh,
I really outdid myself this year.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.700
-[Clara] You did!
-[Lydia laughs]

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.453
Lydia, I've been meaning to ask.
How did your photo shoot go

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.872
-for your gingerbread house?
-Ah, it was for <i>Seasons Magazine.</i>

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.916
It went amazing, you know.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.001
Personally,
I think I should be on the cover!

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.586
[all laugh]

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.171
Or at least like a two-page spread.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.172
-[Barry] Yeah.
-Centerfold.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:40.840
-[Barry] Yeah.
-[Clara] You know what, I'm just gonna...

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:44.594
I'm just going to clear this
out of the way for everyone.

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:46.137
-[Lydia] Thank you, Clara.
-Thanks.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.098
-Yeah. Excuse me, Barry.
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.560
So, um, how are things at work?

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:55.021
-[Barry] Oh, it's going really well.
-[Lydia] Really well? Good. Yeah.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.440
[chatting continues]

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.032
[phone rings]

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.164
Well, hello, Clara!
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.499
Clive says hi.

01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:15.875
-Clive! Say hi!
-Hi.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:17.752
Hi, Clive.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.255
[Bonnie] OK, s <i>o, how was the meal?</i>
<i>How's the family?</i>

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:22.299
You know.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.968
My favorite couple doing so well.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.303
It's, uh...

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:30.390
amazing, and it's absolutely killing me.
[chuckles]

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.475
Do you want to meet for a drink?

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.269
Uh, yeah, of course.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.688
Well, let me just check with Clive.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:39.065
Is it OK if I meet Clara for a drink?

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.859
-Yup.
-Clive says yup.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:44.362
OK, great. I'll meet you--
I'll meet you there.

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:46.448
OK. Bye.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.493
Thanks, babe. See you later.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.332
[sighs]

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:58.376
-Hey, honey. Everything OK?
-Hey.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.338
Yeah. Everything's fine.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.424
Mom, do you think, um...

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:06.676
It'd be OK for you
to go have a drink with Bonnie?

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.220
-Yeah.
-[laughs] Sure.

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:10.930
Thank you.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.435
You know, honey, things can change

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:19.230
from one Christmas to the next.
I'm just saying. [chuckles]

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:22.317
Thank you, Mom.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:23.735
You're welcome.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:25.820
[Clara sighs]

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.116
Now, go have fun.

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:32.994
-OK. I'll see you after.
-[Lydia chuckles]

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.461
-[hostess] Hi.
-Hey.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:42.420
How are you doing?

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.306
[Bonnie] Thanks for the drink!

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:55.642
[Clara] No problem.

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:57.685
[laughs]

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.189
Thank you for coming.

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.817
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:06.778
-Hey, Mike!
-[Mike] Yeah?

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.655
-How about a couple of drinks?
-[Mike] Sure, no problem.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:11.324
Christmas... can be a difficult time.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:14.619
[Mike] Yeah. Here you go.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.163
-Thanks, Mike.
-[Mike] You're welcome.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:21.501
To best friends and better days.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.087
-Cheers.
-[glasses clinking]

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:33.638
It's just like everyone
was so... happy.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.474
My sister with her perfect husband,

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.643
and he's just equally happy with her.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.020
And they're both incredibly happy
with their child.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.230
I mean, it was just...

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:44.858
I'm telling you, Bonnie, it was horrible!

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.111
I'm really sorry to hear
about all that happiness.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:50.071
-That sucks.
-Right?

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.786
Well, I'm afraid
I have some happy news?

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:58.163
What?

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:04.669
[Bonnie] I'm engaged!

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.507
-[gasps] Oh, Bonnie!
-[Bonnie giggles]

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.636
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.723
-Oh, you're crying?
-No.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.224
Of course not. I'm not. I'm not.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.560
-You are.
-No, I'm-- They're happy tears.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.520
-They're, uh...
-They don't look happy.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:25.148
They're happy. I'm happy.
I'm so happy for you!

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.234
When are you gonna do it?

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.320
I don't know. Maybe in the spring.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.947
Or... [scoffs] a few years from now.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:35.533
It depends on how long it takes me
to make my own dress.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:37.452
I don't even know how to sew.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:43.458
My best friend is getting married.

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.252
To a terrific Clive.

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:51.007
And I've fallen for a guy

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:55.678
who may not be that guy.
Or he may be that guy

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.096
and I just wrecked everything,

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.099
and I may never even see that guy again.

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:02.101
Except at work.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.604
At the restaurant.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.440
And just five days a week.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.859
More with overtime.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:14.614
Yeah. [sighs]
I'm-- I'm going to quit my job.

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.407
[Bonnie] Well, that's a great idea.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.453
[cell phone rings]

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.584
Hey, Hugh.
How's... how's your Christmas?

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.711
-[children giggling]
-No, the ex-wife dropped off the kids,

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.922
unannounced, and I'm just trying
to get some work done.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.259
Oh, that... sounds... fun!

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.844
Uh, look. I need you to go to the office

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.388
and pick up something for me, please.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.390
Uh, yeah, sure. No problem.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:43.726
I am totally capable
of doing that right now.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:47.605
Good. There are documents
in a manila envelope on my desk.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:49.357
I'd get them myself, but I'm stuck here.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.568
Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem.
I'll... I'll pick them up

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.319
and swing by first thing in the morning.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.863
-See you then.
-Yes, you will!

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.115
No, no, no. No more cookies.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.074
-No, thatâs enough.
-[children continue giggling]

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:00.285
I gotta go. I got to parent here.

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:04.080
-No, seriously. That's five. We're done.
-[children giggling]

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.418
What was that about?

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.253
It's a secret!

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:12.922
I get told secrets now. No big deal.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.259
Well, you can tell me, too!

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.428
Peters just left some paperwork

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.054
at the restaurant
that I have to go pick up.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.599
Well, I am in!

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:24.559
Well...

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.060
This is my fourth glass,
so, I can't drive.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:28.145
-[Clara chuckles]
-Ah!

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.773
I'll get Clive to drive!

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.773
Clive, this is where I work.

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.782
-All right. Come on in.
-[Bonnie] Whoa!

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.908
Hugh's office.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.410
Really nice. I like it.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.705
OK, what are we looking for again?

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.667
A yellow envelope. Like this.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:34.504
[cabinet drawer clunking]

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.174
Honey, I... I think that might be locked.

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:39.591
No, it's just stuck.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.803
B-Bonnie, I...

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.307
-See!
-[Clara] Bonnie, I...

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:47.809
I got it.

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:49.477
Me too!

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:52.270
I probably think it's this one
that was on his desk

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.189
exactly where he told me
it was gonna be.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:57.443
Well, this is yellow as well,
so, I think it deserves a look.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:01.656
This is a...
Oh, this is Shane's contract.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:05.702
That's a lot of zeros.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.913
This one's just a lot of parking lots.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:11.708
What?

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.419
-Pretty boring!
-[Clara] Oh...

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:17.672
Oh, no, no.
This is, uh... this is just our, uh...

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.049
What?

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:23.636
You've got to be kidding me.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.680
What? Is it about me?

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:28.141
Clive, you're a city planner, right?

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.059
Correct. Why?

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.688
Because we need to go to your office.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.983
-Yay! Oh, my gosh.
-No, no, no.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.067
-Yes!
-We don't do that.

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.360
-Oh, we're going!
-Or-- You know what?

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.113
-[Jackie] Aw.
-[Frank] Here.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.699
Ah, you know, we forgot
to share the mistletoe.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.493
That's because
we don't need any mistletoe.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.870
-[Frank] Hmm. We don't.
-[knocking at the door]

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:49.787
Shoot. Who's it?

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.374
[Frank] Hey! Look who came in

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.918
-from the cold. Come here!
-[Jackie] Merry Christmas, Shane!

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:56.919
[Shane] Merry Christmas.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.546
[Jackie] Aw! Oh!

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:02.049
-I'm not intruding at all, am I?
-No, of course not.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.343
Absolutely not! You know
we love guests at Christmas.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.095
OK.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.349
Oh! You look like you could use
something to eat.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:14.479
How about I make you a nice sandwich,
or Frank can make you a drink?

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:18.483
I'd love a sandwich.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.234
OK, you got it.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:22.987
-Thanks, honey.
-Thanks, Jackie.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.032
Come on. Take your jacket off.
Make yourself at home.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.618
-Thanks so much.
-You're welcome.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.538
[indistinct conversation]

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.248
-[Clara] Bonnie!
-This is great.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.834
This is so exciting!

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.252
[Clive] I don't know why I'm doing this.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:39.796
-This is insane.
-Come on. Please, Clive.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.632
You're doing it because
it's an exciting secret mission.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:44.967
And because you love me.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.178
Get in. Get in. Quietly.

01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:48.846
[inaudible]

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:58.981
-But we love him.
-Yeah.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:02.693
When I first came here,

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.737
I didn't--I didn't tell you guys
what I was looking for.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.155
And I didn't... didn't show you this.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:09.867
Aw.

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:11.744
[Shane] That's my parents
on their honeymoon.

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:16.749
Yeah, that picture hung up in our kitchen
for as long as I can remember.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.210
They never really said where they took it,

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:21.504
and I didn't really ask
because I was a kid.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.549
But they said it was somewhere
in the American mountainside,

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:27.760
and that one day they'd...
they'd visit again.

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.638
But--But they--they never did.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.517
And you think they stayed here?

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:36.143
[Shane] I don't know.

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:38.229
I don't know. I kind of...

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.398
You know, I've been ruling out
some of the other places in the area,

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:44.527
but most of them have been
torn down or long closed.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:49.615
Yeah. I'm so sorry.
I don't recognize them at all.

01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:53.661
Of course, this doesn't mean anything
because when this photo was taken

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:55.371
my parents would've been
running the place,

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.956
and I would've just been a little kid.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.625
-But, honey, I do recognize that cushion.
-Hmm.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.919
Yeah, yeah.
That's--That's the one right over there.

01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:04.839
Yeah, but the trouble is these cushions
are all over the place, you know.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.091
Right.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.677
I--I don't know if it helps,
but on the back

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.013
-is a... a date stamped there.
-Hmm.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.765
-Oh, in the 80's.
-Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:18.269
You see, we had a fire here in '92,

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.855
and it destroyed almost all the records.

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:23.983
Otherwise, we could've looked up
their names in the log book.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.694
[Shane] Right. Yeah, I was...

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.031
I was just hoping to find
that ornament, but...

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.700
if it were here, you guys probably...

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.785
probably auctioned it off anyways.

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:35.745
[Frank] Yeah.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:36.746
[Jackie] Whoa!

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:40.958
-What?
-Wait, wait, wait a minute.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:43.920
Wait. Here, check this out.
Here, take this. Take this.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:44.962
OK.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:51.469
Oh, there's no way.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.080
I thought you guys would've...

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:20.998
I thought...

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:24.710
I thought you guys would've sold these.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:28.464
Well... yes, we would've,
but not that one.

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:30.299
That one is special.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:33.511
That one my mother made the year
they built this place.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:37.264
And every Christmas Eve we have
our guests put it on the tree.

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:41.477
So, if your parents stayed here
over Christmas...

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.731
they would've been asked
to do the honors.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.608
It's our way of making our guests

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:49.443
feel like they're family
at Christmas time.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.283
[sobs]

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:00.955
So, they were here.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:03.666
They were here.

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:06.836
[Frank] So, Shane...

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.923
would you like to do the honors?

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:19.515
You know, I...

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:24.353
I'd actually like to share this
with someone.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.022
If that's OK.

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:34.488
[voice breaking] Thank you for this.

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:46.792
Did you find it yet?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.253
I literally just started looking!

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.173
It's, uh... Peters. Hugh Peters.
-[Bonnie scoffs]

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:55.176
-[Bonnie] Hugh.
-Oh. OK, here it is.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.471
It looks like he's made
some exploratory proposals.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.016
What?

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.018
[Bonnie] What is it?

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:08.981
It's just a bunch of condos,
or parking lots, and...

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.816
Wait, this is not what we talked about.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.318
-I don't understand what this is.
-[Clive] Let me take these

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.277
and make a copy.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:14.570
You can read them in the morning, Clara.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:16.530
And then you are gonna destroy them.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.991
And then we'll pretend
that this never happened. OK?

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:21.660
OK.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.496
-All right.
-[Clara] Thank you.

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:27.875
I love you guys! Bonnie and Clive!

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:28.876
[all chuckle]

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:32.171
-We're criminals!
-[Clive] Oh, heaven help me.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.214
[all chuckle]

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:48.104
[Lydia humming a Christmas song]

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:55.277
Oh, Merry Christmas, sunshine.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.239
Merry Christmas, Mom. Thank you.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.700
Oh. Someone had
a little bit too much fun last night.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:02.868
Mm-hmm.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:03.994
[Lydia chuckles]

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:08.958
[sighs]

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:13.587
Where'd you find these?

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:15.422
They were scattered in the foyer.

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:21.554
I--

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.307
[Lydia continues humming]

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:28.769
I can't believe he did this.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:32.189
How about a bagel and lox?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:37.153
A Bloody Mary?

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.533
[Clara] Mom, I'm so sorry.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.911
I promise I'll be back, OK?
I just have to do something.

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.037
No breakfast?

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:52.960
[car approaching]

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:20.237
[knocking on door]

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.614
[Hugh] Yeah, I'm coming!

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:29.997
Clara.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.167
-Did you get the folder?
-Oh, you mean Shane's contract? Yes.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.460
Thanks. I have to get these off
this morning.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.502
And there's this!

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.464
You don't want to renovate
the Mountain View.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.758
You don't want to "restore it
to its former glory".

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:41.884
You want to tear it down

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:44.511
for condos, and concessions
and parking lots!

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.722
[Hugh] These are just
exploratory proposals.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.308
Where did you get these?

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.936
You used me
to get to Frank and Jackie.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.646
[Hugh] And you couldn't even
get that done.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:56.774
They called me this morning
to tell me that the deal is dead.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.277
Yeah, it turns out your boyfriend Shane
convinced them to shut it down.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:02.071
I never should've trusted that guy.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:04.240
He's not my boyfriend.
And Shane's in New York.

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:05.241
[Hugh snickers]

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.492
Is that--Is that what he said?

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:10.454
Yeah, it looks like Santa's flying past
both of our houses this Christmas.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.832
Yeah, well, you can take
your stupid necklace back, too.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:19.213
I hope you realize you're fired!

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.090
Oh, I quit!

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.685
[engine turning over]

01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:41.694
Come on!

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:43.487
-[knocking on the car]
-What?

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:44.697
[Shane] Merry Christmas.

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:48.784
Can I give you a ride?

01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:53.622
[chuckles] Come on.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.296
[railroad crossing
bells blaring]

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:09.221
[train whistling in the distance]

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:12.808
-[Shane] It's a long train.
-[sighs]

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.811
How did you even find me?

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:19.898
I went to your mother's house.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:24.153
Well, she told me
that you were at Bonnie and Clive's.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.946
And so I went there and, um...

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:29.283
I mean, they told me about
your little crime spree last night.

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:32.536
And then I kind of figured out
where you might be headed.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.788
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:36.832
but I went to the office,
there were two envelopes and--

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.375
[Shane] I didn't come here for the job.

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.380
I came here because
I was looking for something,

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.132
that promise that I made to myself.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.302
And that's why I went
to the Mountain View.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.722
And that's why I was there last night.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.360
These are my parents.

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:13.243
Their honeymoon was the one and only
vacation that they ever took.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.624
You know, they lived in New York City,
and they could...

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.168
they could barely make ends meet, so...

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:24.296
it was really difficult for them.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:27.925
My father was a cook at a greasy spoon.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.218
My mother was a server.

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.096
And as a kid I saw...

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:36.767
I saw how hard they struggled
in their careers, you know.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:40.396
[chuckles] But I guess that's...

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:43.232
that's where I developed
my love for cooking.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.280
When I started to get successful
I promised them that I'd slow down

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:52.908
and find myself a beautiful little spot

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.952
like the one
that started them off so right.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.248
But I--I didn't.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:05.504
Three years ago,
my mother died of cancer.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:11.385
Another year later, my father suffered
a massive heart attack.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.934
So, here I am... [sighs]
three years too late,

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.979
trying to make good
on a promise to a family

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:23.772
that I didn't even deserve.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.693
You know any family
would be lucky to have you.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.030
That's really sweet.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.537
Now, come on.
I want to show you something.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.012
[geese honking in the distance]

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:18.785
[Shane] Come on in.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.914
[both] Merry Christmas!

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.542
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:28.170
Dinner will be served
in the main dining room

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:29.338
in a few minutes.

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:42.643
I would actually like to give you
your Christmas present.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:55.989
It's just like the picture.

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:58.283
Mm-hmm.
Well, would you do the honors?

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:01.787
Please?

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.344
[Frank] Gotcha!

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:28.105
That's the most thoughtful gift
anyone could ever give me.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:29.731
Oh, that's not your gift.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.485
-What?
-No, no. This is your gift.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.786
It took me a long time to figure out

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:44.705
what I wanted to do
for the rest of my life.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.835
But when the picture
brought me to you...

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:56.008
I knew that this... [chuckles]
this was the right choice.

01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:08.854
Jackie and Frank
have agreed to sell their hotel.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.232
But only to you.

01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:18.655
Shane, I can't afford that.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:20.032
I want to invest...

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.493
solely in your business, Clara...

01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:26.955
because you deserve it.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.459
You can fix this place up

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.170
any way you want.

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.298
Jackie and Frank have agreed

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.592
to stick around and work for you.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.303
I mean, I'd like to hand in my resume

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.388
for the head chef, of course,
and do all the cooking...

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.309
minus the Eggs Florentine.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:53.106
But you don't have to hire me.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:56.943
You don't have to do anything
you don't want...

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:01.657
because it's all yours.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.706
Can it be ours?

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:19.299
I love you.

01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:22.302
I love you.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:41.279
You should know...

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:43.990
I just got you a scarf.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.785
[laughing] That's just what I wanted.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.085
Merry Christmas.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.630
Merry Christmas.

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:07.514
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

And he says he could sneak us
up the mountain for a late night ski.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:23.655
You want to go?

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.701
You mean another exciting mission? Yes!

-See! I knew you weren't boring.
-[Clive chuckles]

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:32.122
All right! Let's go do this.

-Now? Oh, OK!
-Right now! Right now!

She loves it.

[Lydia] Shane!

01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:50.182
There you are.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.018
I've been watching your show.

Uh, Ms. Garrison,
I'm gonna have to explain.

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:00.859
Uh, you see on the show,
we have these personas.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.611
-[baby murmuring]
-Yeah, he's not actually that bad.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:03.820
Yeah. I'm really not.

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:06.948
Uh, Clara, I know that
he's playing a character. [chuckles]

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.241
And your brilliant, OK.

-That's exactly why I want

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:10.660
to pick your brain.

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:14.289
See, I've been thinking
about branding myself

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:16.917
in the gourmet gingerbread
market. Mm-hmm.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.585
-[Shane] Oh! Uh...
-Yeah!

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:22.506
Uh, yeah, listen, I have like three
or four contacts in that market.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:24.508
Really? I was featured
in <i>Seasons Magazine.</i>

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:25.467
Oh, is that right?

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:28.345
-She tells everyone!
-I should've been on the cover.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.598
But, you know, it was like
a two-page spread. It was great!

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.558
I will be right back, I've got a copy.

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:35.519

I'm going to autograph it for you.
