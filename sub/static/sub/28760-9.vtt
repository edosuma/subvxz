00:01.260 --> 00:03.319
TERESA: Previously,
on Queen of the South...

00:03.370 --> 00:04.325
Would you be Tony's godmother?

00:04.370 --> 00:06.065
If something happens
to Chino or me,

00:06.100 --> 00:07.192
will you take care of him?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.299
Yes, of course.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.706
POTE: You can take it.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.230
Are you serious?

00:13.280 --> 00:15.908
It could protect you,
or it will kill you.

00:15.940 --> 00:18.044
Tony's father--
I squeezed the trigger

00:18.080 --> 00:19.069
and took his life.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.418
Honestly, I'm worried.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.418
Ever since he came back
from the hospital,

00:23.450 --> 00:24.587
he hasn't been right.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.087
They changed his medication,

00:26.120 --> 00:28.259
and now he wanders
around the house

00:28.290 --> 00:29.359
like a damn zombie.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.028
RANDALL: Broken taillight.

00:31.060 --> 00:32.027
That should give us our killer.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.858
(synth music)

00:34.900 --> 00:37.664
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:37.700 --> 00:40.339
*

00:40.370 --> 00:41.268
(YEIPS)

00:41.300 --> 00:42.335
(groans)

00:42.370 --> 00:44.008
Murdering a witness

00:44.040 --> 00:45.837
under federal protection--

00:45.870 --> 00:47.098
it's a suicide mission.

00:47.140 --> 00:48.402
I know.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.839
I'll do it.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.904
Oye, esto es por
mi primo!

00:50.950 --> 00:57.788
*

00:57.820 --> 01:00.857
Go to New Orleans.
Take care of her.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.380
(yells in Spanish)

01:04.130 --> 01:07.099
(warm music)

01:07.130 --> 01:09.724
*

01:09.770 --> 01:11.067
TONY:
This place is amazing.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.692
*

01:12.740 --> 01:13.934
Come check out your room.

01:13.970 --> 01:20.830
*

01:22.010 --> 01:23.307
TERESA:
I had Manny help me out.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.908
*

01:24.950 --> 01:26.941
What do you think?

01:26.980 --> 01:28.470
I love it.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.114
Welcome home.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.289
POTE: Teresita.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.914
*

01:35.960 --> 01:38.258
I'll be right back.

01:38.290 --> 01:44.229
*

01:44.270 --> 01:45.794
POTE:
Cheo's still alive.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.264
That rat is gonna talk.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.939
Manny's picking up Javier.

01:50.970 --> 01:52.801
Kelly Anne is packing up
our house

01:52.840 --> 01:54.501
and George is waiting for us
in Belize.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.179
We can go straight
to the airport from here.

01:57.210 --> 01:59.007
I'm gonna call Lafayette.

01:59.050 --> 02:00.938
The pinche judge
only cares for himself.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.084
And our money.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.611
(dramatic music)

02:05.650 --> 02:10.758
*

02:10.790 --> 02:12.758
Where's Lafayette?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.654
You're toxic.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.327
He ain't coming
anywhere near you.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.622
I paid him $3 million.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.865
Your boy Javier

02:22.910 --> 02:24.832
out of jail
after shiwing another man?

02:24.870 --> 02:27.338
You have no idea
the favors we had to call in.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.871
This is a waste of time.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.172
Let's go.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.711
My contact
in witness protection

02:32.750 --> 02:34.547
says your mark
hasn't made a deal.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.480
He's horse-trading
with the US. Attorney.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.283
TERESA:
What is he waiting for?

02:38.320 --> 02:39.287
_ RANDALL:
HIS baby mama won't go

02:39.320 --> 02:40.457
into witness protection.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.629
till he can talk some sense
into her, but...

02:44.660 --> 02:46.196
the Feds are done.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.356
They're dropping the hammer
on Cheo

02:47.400 --> 02:48.651
the day after tomorrow,

02:48.700 --> 02:51.021
which means
you got 24 hours

02:51.070 --> 02:52.298
to save your ass.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.365
By going after Cheo's family.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.800
Necessary evil
in your line of work,

02:56.840 --> 02:59.206
I'm guessing.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.730
I don't like it.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.509
RANDALL:
From this moment forward,

03:02.550 --> 03:04.905
we never met,

03:04.950 --> 03:07.578
and I'll trust
that you can keep

03:07.620 --> 03:10.009
Judge Lafayette's
honorable name

03:10.050 --> 03:11.483
out of your dirty little mouth.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.159
*

03:14.190 --> 03:15.350
Let's go.

03:15.390 --> 03:22.262
*

03:24.600 --> 03:27.535
This is like you coming
after me, Brenda, and Tony.

03:27.570 --> 03:28.559
That's right.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.704
In this life,

03:30.740 --> 03:33.379
family is
your greatest strength,

03:33.410 --> 03:35.332
and your greatest weakness.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.041
We killed El Gordo's man

03:37.080 --> 03:39.878
to protect this woman
and her son.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.911
Now we go after them?

03:41.950 --> 03:44.589
It comes down to this,
Teresita.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.714
Cheo's family or yours.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.389
*

03:51.430 --> 03:54.399
(classical music playing)

03:54.430 --> 04:01.290
*

04:04.910 --> 04:06.434
That's a lot of money.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.608
$3 million, to be exact.

04:09.650 --> 04:16.510
*

04:17.520 --> 04:19.715
Go ahead, Davis.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.081
Speak your mind.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.657
Where'd it come from?

04:24.690 --> 04:26.954
That's none of your concern.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.127
*

04:29.160 --> 04:32.061
I just buried my cousin,

04:32.100 --> 04:33.590
who was found burnt

04:33.640 --> 04:35.995
in the trunk of a car.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.008
That is my concern.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.099
Does that money have something
to do with it?

04:40.140 --> 04:41.505
It does not.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.041
Liar.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.077
You pretend to be this--
this honorable man,

04:46.110 --> 04:48.613
but you are a crook
and a liar.

04:48.650 --> 04:50.584
*

04:50.620 --> 04:52.212
Hmm.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.651
I'm sorry you feel
that way, son...

04:56.690 --> 04:59.591
*

04:59.630 --> 05:03.259
But know this:

05:03.300 --> 05:06.292
everything I've done,

05:06.340 --> 05:09.798
I've done to take care of you,

05:09.840 --> 05:12.104
because you can't
take care of yourself.

05:12.140 --> 05:14.438
That's not true.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.176
Now who's lying, son?

05:17.210 --> 05:18.541
*

05:18.580 --> 05:21.014
(cell phone buzzes)

05:21.050 --> 05:23.211
*

05:23.250 --> 05:24.808
Sorry.
It's work.

05:26.390 --> 05:29.211
It's a sad day, Randall.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.683
Our money train's
riding out of town.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.049
Well, I got something

05:33.100 --> 05:35.853
that might ease the sting
a bit.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.164
Found a person of interest
in Ren's murder.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.292
Where are you?

05:39.330 --> 05:40.729
RANDALL: Smokehouse.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.499
The smokehouse?

05:42.540 --> 05:43.734
My favorite place

05:43.770 --> 05:45.965
for a little private
conversation.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.807
Be there tout suite,

05:47.840 --> 05:50.206
and make sure you put
something down on the floor.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.219
My shoes got ruined last time.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.740
Copy that.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.749
(ominous music)

05:57.790 --> 06:04.389
*

06:05.590 --> 06:06.591
Gracias.

06:06.630 --> 06:07.756
I'll wake him up.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.597
I'll get your bags.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.398
(melancholy music)

06:15.440 --> 06:22.300
*

06:33.760 --> 06:35.512
You didn't wake him?

06:35.560 --> 06:38.256
*

06:38.290 --> 06:39.951
He's been on the move
for years now.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.627
*

06:41.660 --> 06:44.595
Lived out of his backpack
for half of his life.

06:44.630 --> 06:48.031
Brenda filled it
with birth certificate,

06:48.070 --> 06:49.469
family pictures,

06:49.510 --> 06:50.636
in case they ever had to run.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.035
*

06:52.070 --> 06:54.379
He finally unpacked.

06:54.410 --> 06:56.378
I won't move him now.

06:56.410 --> 06:59.379
(dramatic music)

06:59.410 --> 07:00.411
*

07:00.450 --> 07:02.645
Find Cheo's family.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.419
Seora.

07:04.450 --> 07:10.184
*

07:18.270 --> 07:21.239
(uneasy music)

07:21.270 --> 07:28.130
*

07:28.940 --> 07:30.168
Let's go.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.507
Not yet, cabrn.

07:31.550 --> 07:34.474
*

07:34.520 --> 07:36.579
Wasn't that Cheo's lawyer?

07:36.620 --> 07:37.917
(grunts)

07:37.950 --> 07:39.110
*

07:39.150 --> 07:40.185
With some muscle

07:40.220 --> 07:43.121
and a metal-plated Benz.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.527
Only one person's
more paranoid than the rat.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.289
That's his lawyer.

07:48.330 --> 07:49.922
Then how can we find
Cheo's woman?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.926
*

07:51.970 --> 07:53.164
Through her.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.269
*

07:54.300 --> 07:56.336
She's the legal secretary.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.133
*

07:58.170 --> 07:59.979
(phone beeps, line ringing)

08:00.010 --> 08:01.329
How's it going?

08:01.380 --> 08:03.940
I think I have a way
to get to Luz.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.039
We only have 12 hours left

08:06.080 --> 08:08.139
before Cheo is in front
of the US. Attorney.

08:08.180 --> 08:09.681
If this doesn't work--

08:09.720 --> 08:11.813
We run.
I know.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.010
Keep me posted.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.209
Est bien.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.353
Tony?

08:27.900 --> 08:30.869
(ominous music)

08:30.910 --> 08:37.509
*

08:52.230 --> 08:53.219
JAVIER: Patrona.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.649
*

08:55.700 --> 08:57.429
Can I talk to you?

08:57.470 --> 08:58.823
Yes.

08:58.870 --> 09:05.730
*

09:11.280 --> 09:14.113
I'm sorry, patrona.
I let you down.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.015
*

09:16.050 --> 09:18.086
Don't be.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.111
We knew attacking Cheo

09:20.160 --> 09:21.889
wasn't going to be easy.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.581
I'm glad that you got out.

09:23.630 --> 09:30.297
*

09:33.140 --> 09:34.437
What is that?

09:34.470 --> 09:37.030
Is that Tony's?
El chamaco?

09:37.070 --> 09:39.061
(softly) Yeah.

09:39.110 --> 09:41.635
I don't understand.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.706
Pote killed Tony's father.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.809
He stole from Epifanio.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.715
Well, those are the rules.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.048
You steal, you die.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.910
That doesn't make sense
for a kid.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.417
*

09:55.460 --> 09:57.928
His father will always be
his hero.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.499
*

10:02.530 --> 10:06.068
That's why he wants to be
a sicario, hmm?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.795
It's all he's ever known.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.434
*

10:10.470 --> 10:12.301
Like my family.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.479
*

10:14.510 --> 10:16.432
Like me.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.606
*

10:17.650 --> 10:20.141
I don't want that for him.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.910
JAVIER: He needs to be
a normal boy,

10:22.950 --> 10:26.613
do normal things like--
like other kids.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.753
My life isn't normal,

10:28.790 --> 10:30.348
and neither is Tony.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.699
Does he know we're leaving?

10:32.730 --> 10:34.698
Not yet.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.425
I don't want to scare him

10:36.460 --> 10:39.020
before we know that we have
to leave New Orleans.

10:39.070 --> 10:43.404
*

10:51.910 --> 10:54.617
Damn it, they're late,

10:54.650 --> 10:56.515
and my pinche mermaid's
melting.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.809
They're here, jefe.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.714
Okay.
Andale, ndale!

11:01.760 --> 11:03.648
Sigan, por favor.
Vmonos!

11:03.690 --> 11:05.783
(bright music)

11:05.830 --> 11:07.957
Emilia--

11:08.000 --> 11:09.820
She wasn't at the airport,
jefe.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.065
She missed her flight
from New Orleans.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.193
What do you mean,
she missed her flight?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.196
Mm-hmm?

11:16.240 --> 11:19.209
(dark music)

11:19.240 --> 11:20.229
*

11:26.210 --> 11:28.474
*

11:28.520 --> 11:30.385
Whatever it takes.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.819
Go!

11:31.850 --> 11:37.550
*

11:45.630 --> 11:47.063
LAFAYE'I'I'E: Emilia.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.103
What a--what a beautiful name

11:50.140 --> 11:53.337
for a beautiful lady.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.075
I'm Judge Lafayette.

11:55.110 --> 11:56.941
*

11:56.980 --> 11:58.743
I don't understand
why I'm here, sir.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.441
I...

12:00.480 --> 12:01.845
I swear I did nothing wrong.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.383
(breathing shakily)

12:04.420 --> 12:07.548
Yet y-you were driving the car

12:07.590 --> 12:11.356
tied to the murder
of my nephew Ren.

12:11.390 --> 12:14.757
*

12:14.800 --> 12:17.769
I-I don't know Ren.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.439
This is a mistake.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.965
Do you have children, Emilia?

12:26.410 --> 12:27.308
No, seor.

12:27.340 --> 12:28.568
LAFAYETTE: I have one.

12:28.610 --> 12:29.577
Uh...

12:29.610 --> 12:32.204
He's, uh--he's weak,

12:32.250 --> 12:34.741
a runt,

12:34.780 --> 12:37.988
but my--my nephew Ren was--

12:38.020 --> 12:39.442
was like a son to me.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.321
Someone spilled his blood,

12:45.360 --> 12:48.454
my blood.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.128
They--they--
they burned his body

12:51.170 --> 12:53.968
in a--in a trunk of a car

12:54.000 --> 12:56.639
like he was next day's trash.

12:56.670 --> 13:00.731
*

13:00.780 --> 13:04.147
And for that,

13:04.180 --> 13:07.047
there will be atonement.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.712
(gunfire)

13:15.790 --> 13:17.587
TERESA: Hey, Tony.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.757
-(turns off television)
-Hey, what's up?

13:19.790 --> 13:20.950
Let's get out of here.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.297
Let's go for a drive.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.218
Is everything okay?

13:25.530 --> 13:27.794
-Okay, I-I'll tell him.
-Tell me what?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.331
Uh, she wants to teach you
how to drive.

13:30.370 --> 13:31.860
How old are you again?

13:31.910 --> 13:33.707
Almost 16.
Are you kidding?

13:33.740 --> 13:35.879
You have to learn sometime.

13:35.910 --> 13:36.979
(laughs softly)

13:37.010 --> 13:38.045
We'll find a quiet place

13:38.080 --> 13:39.638
so you can burn some rubber.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.612
Cool?

13:40.650 --> 13:41.844
I'll get my shoes.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.789
(eerie music)

13:45.820 --> 13:47.048
*

13:47.090 --> 13:48.387
They're here to pack up.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.512
Can they start, patrona?

13:52.390 --> 13:53.789
(speaks Spanish)

13:53.830 --> 13:59.564
*

13:59.600 --> 14:01.864
El Gordo didn't mention
a kid.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.733
HITMAN: He won't get
in the way.

14:04.770 --> 14:07.000
And if he does?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.200
They can share a grave.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.379
*

14:16.120 --> 14:19.544
TONY: What is this place?
It's creepy.

14:19.590 --> 14:22.559
JAVIER: It was a theme park
before Hurricane Katrina.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.148
Nobody comes here,
so you can hit

14:24.190 --> 14:26.351
anything you want, cabroncito.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.096
Don't hit anything, Tony.

14:28.130 --> 14:29.427
I'll be careful.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.963
Oh.

14:36.970 --> 14:39.029
Gracias.

14:39.070 --> 14:40.731
De nada, patrona.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.475
(cell phone buzzes)

15:02.300 --> 15:05.064
(eerie music)

15:05.100 --> 15:06.567
Jesus.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.567
Tranquilo, Nancy.

15:11.270 --> 15:12.999
POTE: We're not here
to hurt you.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.402
Sit down.

15:21.450 --> 15:24.647
You work for bad people

15:24.690 --> 15:26.954
that work for worse people,

15:26.990 --> 15:29.015
like Cheo Ortiz.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.498
What do you want?

15:33.530 --> 15:35.998
To know where his family's at.

15:36.030 --> 15:37.622
(suspenseful music)

15:37.670 --> 15:39.297
I'm just a paralegal.
I...

15:39.330 --> 15:41.491
I only write briefs.
1--

15:41.540 --> 15:43.428
*

15:43.470 --> 15:45.506
POTE: You're a good mother.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.007
(glass shattering)

15:47.040 --> 15:48.905
Girl Scout,

15:48.940 --> 15:51.170
soccer,

15:51.210 --> 15:53.519
church choir.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.313
I-I don't--
I don't know anything.

15:55.350 --> 15:57.818
Corrine.

15:57.850 --> 15:59.010
*

15:59.050 --> 16:02.156
She's a freshman
at Tulane, right?

16:02.190 --> 16:05.284
So nice to have family
so close by.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.683
(glass shattering)

16:06.730 --> 16:09.494
She could come home
and enjoy mami's gumbo.

16:09.530 --> 16:10.861
(glass shatters)

16:10.900 --> 16:14.290
We're making a visit
to one of these ladies today.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.433
*

16:16.470 --> 16:20.338
-Cheo's girl or yours.
-(glass shattering)

16:20.380 --> 16:21.870
Your choice.

16:21.910 --> 16:28.816
*

16:39.890 --> 16:41.152
Easy, easy.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.065
Yeah, that's it.
Just tap it.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.067
Just tap the gas.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.021
I just did.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.799
It's--it's so fast.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.195
(laughs)
You'll get it.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.537
-Try it again.
-Okay.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.502
TERESA: That's it!

16:53.540 --> 16:55.474
You can go
a little bit faster.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.569
Okay.

16:59.010 --> 17:00.819
-TERESA: That's it!
-TONY: Hey!

17:00.850 --> 17:02.841
I can do it.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.849
(disquieting music)

17:05.890 --> 17:07.414
Gotcha, cabrn.

17:10.860 --> 17:17.299
*

17:23.770 --> 17:24.759
What would you do
if you weren't

17:24.810 --> 17:26.869
in this business?

17:26.910 --> 17:28.036
Hmm.

17:30.910 --> 17:33.071
Probably...

17:33.120 --> 17:35.941
open a bird store in Celaya
with my sister.

17:38.950 --> 17:40.884
That's your dream?

17:42.820 --> 17:44.082
(laughs)

17:44.130 --> 17:45.381
No, hombre.

17:45.430 --> 17:46.579
She loves them, though.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.052
-Oh.
-MANNY: Macaws,

17:48.100 --> 17:51.263
cockatoos, parrots.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.791
They're loud.
(chuckles)

17:53.840 --> 17:55.728
But they're nice to look at.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.029
Y tu?

18:02.080 --> 18:03.809
If you weren't here?

18:07.150 --> 18:08.970
I know nothing else.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.078
EMILIA: I-I let a friend

18:10.120 --> 18:11.439
use my car a few weeks ago.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.050
Maybe she knows something.

18:14.090 --> 18:16.115
Who's your friend?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.481
She works for a cruise line.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.883
She's on a ship right now.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.329
(suspenseful music)

18:21.360 --> 18:23.419
Did she ever mention
my nephew?

18:23.470 --> 18:24.892
EMILIA: N0.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.921
Listen, I'm--
I'm really, really sorry

18:26.970 --> 18:28.961
about your family,
but I told you

18:29.000 --> 18:30.934
everything I know.

18:30.970 --> 18:33.404
If you let me go,
when--when she gets back,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.135
I can take you to her.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.239
She's lying
through her teeth.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.508
*

18:38.550 --> 18:40.006
I found this in her purse.

18:40.050 --> 18:42.416
Matches the one we found
next to Ren's body.

18:42.450 --> 18:49.288
*

18:49.320 --> 18:51.026
Clever girl.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.857
*

18:52.890 --> 18:54.949
Almost believed you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.797
*

18:56.830 --> 18:59.162
No one knows who you are

18:59.200 --> 19:01.794
or where you are.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.364
EMILIA: No, no, no.
Please...

19:03.410 --> 19:05.833
So I'll give you
one last chance

19:05.870 --> 19:07.872
-to save yourself, Emilia.
-Oh...

19:07.910 --> 19:10.470
-Who killed my nephew?
-EMILIA: I don't know.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.638
I swear to God,
I don't know.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.977
Unfortunately for you,

19:15.020 --> 19:16.612
the good Lord's not listening.

19:16.650 --> 19:17.787

-This--

19:26.560 --> 19:28.653
this is awesome.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.053
I'm glad you're happy.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.793
Listen, Tony.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.432
I'm worried about you.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.760
I saw your sketchbook.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.475
You went through my stuff?

19:45.510 --> 19:46.670
No.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.314
That's messed up.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.715
Is that why
you brought me here?

19:49.750 --> 19:50.978
No, of course not.
I just wanted--

19:51.020 --> 19:53.045
No, no, no, forget it.

19:53.090 --> 19:54.853
I'm out.

(grunting)

20:17.140 --> 20:24.046

20:34.760 --> 20:37.866
You still hate Pote
for what he did.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.733
What he did?

20:40.770 --> 20:42.465
He murdered him.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.468
And you want revenge.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.669
I saw your drawings.

20:51.110 --> 20:53.442
That's not about me
killing Pote.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.249
It's me keeping him alive.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.979
I don't understand.

21:02.490 --> 21:04.549
(uneasy music)

21:04.590 --> 21:06.626
Those sketches
are my nightmares.

21:06.660 --> 21:09.891
*

21:09.930 --> 21:12.490
I draw to get them
out of my head...

21:12.530 --> 21:15.829
So I can sleep,

21:15.870 --> 21:18.566
so I can try and feel normal.

CHICHO: Gotcha.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.828
LUZ: Stay away from him!
Don't touch him!

24:05.870 --> 24:07.735
-LUZ: Don't hurt him!
-CHICHO: (speaks Spanish)

24:07.780 --> 24:09.429
*

24:11.180 --> 24:13.171
(toy gun snaps)

24:13.210 --> 24:15.974
*

24:23.730 --> 24:25.152
(cell phone buzzes)

24:28.360 --> 24:29.759
(foreboding music)

24:29.800 --> 24:31.324
Gotta take this.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.792
Orale.

24:32.830 --> 24:33.865
*

24:33.900 --> 24:35.458
Hola.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.899
Primo.

24:39.170 --> 24:40.307
You tell me.

24:40.340 --> 24:41.534
*

24:41.580 --> 24:43.377
How's your lady?

24:43.410 --> 24:44.377
My what?

24:44.410 --> 24:45.877
Teresita.

24:45.910 --> 24:47.673
You were gonna tell her

24:47.720 --> 24:50.143
about the swamp.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.681
Do I still gotta watch
my back?

24:51.720 --> 24:52.846
No.

24:52.890 --> 24:55.188
It all worked out.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.653
Yeah?

24:56.690 --> 25:00.387
-(liquid sloshes)
-BOAZ: That's good.

25:00.430 --> 25:01.988
You're a good liar.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.396
Keep your girls in the dark.

25:11.370 --> 25:14.203
Women have a way
of being tricky.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.798
(sharp thwack)

25:15.840 --> 25:20.812
*

25:20.850 --> 25:23.011
Do you know
what Siete Gotas is?

25:23.050 --> 25:25.848
*

25:25.890 --> 25:30.179
Yeah, it's your tequila
and a neighborhood in Culiacn.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.529
Yeah, it's where I grew up.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.859
I got by as a moneychanger.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.356
I used to go to bed

25:37.400 --> 25:39.721
every night hungry

25:39.770 --> 25:42.568
and worried for my safety.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.058
People die every day trying
to come to this country,

25:46.110 --> 25:47.873
hoping for a better life.

25:47.910 --> 25:50.208
You have options.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.003
You can be
whoever you want to be.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.178
People have died
for you to have that chance.

25:55.220 --> 26:01.580
*

26:06.060 --> 26:07.721
Hey, man.
I'm totally lost.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.557
*

26:09.600 --> 26:11.966
I'm sorry.
Can't help you, man.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.199
*

26:17.240 --> 26:18.798
Get down. Get down!
Run!

26:20.140 --> 26:21.072
Get down!

26:21.110 --> 26:23.203
*

26:23.240 --> 26:24.309
Get down.

26:24.350 --> 26:30.949
*

26:30.990 --> 26:32.617
Don't look back.
Keep low.

26:32.650 --> 26:33.651
Go!

26:35.160 --> 26:36.650
Get down.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.495
(grunts)

26:44.530 --> 26:45.997
(yells)

26:46.030 --> 26:50.729
*

26:50.770 --> 26:51.805
Come on.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.761
It's okay.
Go!

26:52.810 --> 26:59.670
*

27:11.830 --> 27:12.785
Mierda.

27:12.830 --> 27:15.594
*

27:15.630 --> 27:18.997
There you go.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.622
POTE: You hungry, mi'jo?

27:20.670 --> 27:22.638
We still have
a bit of a drive.

27:22.670 --> 27:24.308
Where are you taking us?

27:24.340 --> 27:26.934
To see a nice lady.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.200
I didn't mean to scare you.

27:29.240 --> 27:33.074
But if everybody behaves,
everything is gonna be okay.

27:36.650 --> 27:37.981
Here you go.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.358
Everything's gonna be okay.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.469
Right, Luz?

27:54.500 --> 27:57.469
(uneasy music)

27:57.500 --> 28:04.372
*

28:12.520 --> 28:13.851
TERESA:
Let me see the blood.

28:13.890 --> 28:15.357
Look at me.

28:15.390 --> 28:16.414
Don't look at the blood.

28:16.460 --> 28:17.984
It's bleeding bad.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.897
I know.
Just breathe.

28:20.930 --> 28:23.228
-Put pressure here, okay?
-TONY: Okay.

28:23.260 --> 28:24.693
*

28:24.730 --> 28:25.867
Put pressure on it.

28:25.900 --> 28:28.164
Put pressure.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.758
It's okay.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.199
We're gonna get out of here,
okay?

28:31.240 --> 28:33.663
-Okay.
-We are gonna get out of here.

28:33.710 --> 28:40.570
*

28:55.760 --> 28:58.194
(gunshots)

28:58.230 --> 28:59.265
-Who are these guys?
-I don't know.

28:59.300 --> 29:00.426
Listen.

29:00.470 --> 29:01.960
They're here for me,
not for you.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.729
Okay?

29:03.770 --> 29:05.704
I'm gonna run out
to get them away from you.

29:05.740 --> 29:07.401
No, no, please, Teresa.
No, no, please.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.375
Listen, you have
to stay here, Tony, okay?

29:10.410 --> 29:12.207
Teresa, look,
I-I can't lose you.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.308
-Please don't--
-You won't.

29:13.350 --> 29:15.614
You won't lose me, I promise.

29:15.650 --> 29:16.571
Stay here.

29:16.620 --> 29:19.589
(dramatic music)

29:19.620 --> 29:26.480
*

29:31.970 --> 29:34.598
(dramatic synth music)

29:34.640 --> 29:41.500
*

29:56.290 --> 29:57.587
El Gordo says adios.

29:57.620 --> 30:00.487
*

30:00.530 --> 30:01.451
TONY: Leave her alone!

30:01.500 --> 30:02.853
Tony, no.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.993
Put it down,
or I'll blow you away.

30:05.030 --> 30:06.759
You got huevos, cabrn?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.461
*

30:08.500 --> 30:09.489
Tony...

30:09.540 --> 30:10.939
*

30:10.970 --> 30:12.528
You can't do it, can you?

30:12.570 --> 30:19.248
*

30:26.920 --> 30:28.387
That's all of them, patrona.

30:28.420 --> 30:29.387
Ests a bien?

30:29.420 --> 30:31.285
(pants) Tony.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.285
-JAVIER: Did he hurt you?
-TERESA: No. I'm okay.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.479
Look at me.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.122
Look at me.
Are you okay?

30:35.160 --> 30:36.696
-(quietly) Yes.
-Are you okay?

30:36.730 --> 30:38.789
Yeah?
Okay, give me the gun, okay?

30:38.830 --> 30:40.468
You're okay.

30:40.500 --> 30:43.060
-Let's go.
-JAVIER: (mutters indistinctly)

30:43.100 --> 30:48.072
*

30:52.510 --> 30:54.842
We called hospitals,
jails, bus stations.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.714
You need to look harder.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.520
She called me
two days ago.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.926
She told me _
she was coming to Mexnco.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.157
Maybe we can call Javi.
Maybe he can help.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.293
I'll deal with my primo.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.862
Now get out of here.

31:41.430 --> 31:44.126
Raul's men tried to kill me
and almost got Tony.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.967
He's gonna pay
with his life.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.888
I agree,

31:47.940 --> 31:49.931
but we need to deal
with Cheo first,

31:49.970 --> 31:51.403
or it won't matter.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.809
You wanna go get
a doughnut, mi'jo?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.785
I don't want one.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.789
(uneasy music)

32:09.820 --> 32:11.151
*

32:11.190 --> 32:12.589
Well, I do.

32:12.630 --> 32:13.722
Get me one, baby.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.955
*

32:16.000 --> 32:17.649
You got chocolate?

32:17.700 --> 32:19.429
Mami likes chocolate.

32:19.470 --> 32:20.892
Of course.

32:20.930 --> 32:22.932
Dale, Cheito.
Mami's hungry.

32:22.970 --> 32:29.102
*

32:29.140 --> 32:31.279
I've been in love
With a narco once,

32:31.310 --> 32:33.505
just like you.

32:33.550 --> 32:38.112
If I had to do it over again,
I'd run away.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.981
My son's all I have.

32:40.020 --> 32:40.987
(door shuts)

32:41.020 --> 32:42.681
*

32:42.720 --> 32:45.951
And you'd do whatever it takes
to save him,

32:45.990 --> 32:47.992
like me with my godson.

32:48.030 --> 32:50.248
*

32:50.300 --> 32:53.019
So you know
what I'm capable of.

32:53.070 --> 32:56.369
*

32:56.400 --> 33:00.006
I will destroy your family
to save mine.

33:00.040 --> 33:06.445
*

33:06.480 --> 33:08.016
Call him.

33:08.050 --> 33:14.910
*

33:15.920 --> 33:17.456
(dramatic music)

33:17.490 --> 33:19.128
(cell phone rings)

33:19.160 --> 33:20.821
*

33:20.860 --> 33:21.895
It's Luz.

33:21.930 --> 33:24.990
*

33:25.030 --> 33:26.520
Hola, mi amor.

33:26.570 --> 33:28.197
JUNIOR: Hola, papi!

33:28.240 --> 33:30.037
(laughs)
Que pasa, Cheito?

33:30.070 --> 33:32.903
I'm having doughnuts
with mami's new friends.

33:32.940 --> 33:33.861
Do you want one?

33:33.910 --> 33:36.504
Of course.

33:36.540 --> 33:39.373
Mira, put mami on, okay?

33:39.410 --> 33:46.043
*

33:46.090 --> 33:48.354
I have Luz and your son.

33:48.390 --> 33:50.085
You can save them,

33:50.120 --> 33:52.429
or spend the rest of your life
in witness protection

33:52.460 --> 33:53.882
knowing that you killed them.

33:53.930 --> 34:00.790
*

34:02.600 --> 34:04.204
U.S. ATTORNEY:
Good evening, Mr. Ortiz.

34:04.240 --> 34:11.100
*

34:21.420 --> 34:23.251
I'm not testifying.

34:23.290 --> 34:25.019
U.S. ATTORNEY: Excuse me?

34:25.060 --> 34:26.129
*

34:26.160 --> 34:28.424
What's going on here?

34:28.460 --> 34:29.791
*

34:29.830 --> 34:32.367
I'm not a rat.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.267
This is a mistake
you don't wanna make, Ortiz.

34:35.300 --> 34:39.134
I promise, you'll never see
your family again.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.934
*

34:41.980 --> 34:43.971
Do your worst, pendejo.

34:44.010 --> 34:50.916
*

34:51.590 --> 34:52.818
It's done.

34:52.850 --> 34:58.356
*

35:04.470 --> 35:06.290
He'll need this.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.791
They will drive
you and your son

35:09.840 --> 35:12.809
back to Hialeah.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.104
Do you recognize these houses?

35:15.140 --> 35:18.644
My parents'
and my sister's.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.478
You didn't go
into witness protection

35:21.520 --> 35:24.341
because you'd lose
your family.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.188
If you talk,
you lose them anyway.

35:27.220 --> 35:28.778
I won't.

35:28.820 --> 35:32.085
You'll never see me again.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.085
Good.

35:33.130 --> 35:35.098
(disquieting music)

35:35.130 --> 35:36.995
Safe travels.

35:37.030 --> 35:41.091
*

35:41.130 --> 35:43.496
EMILIA: Padre nuestro,

36:05.490 --> 36:07.879
No nos dejes caer

36:07.930 --> 36:09.454
TERESA:
I called Boaz.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.697
He'll send money
to Manny's sister in Celaya.

36:12.730 --> 36:15.335
*

36:15.370 --> 36:17.235
Gracias, patrona.

36:17.270 --> 36:18.806
That's what Manny wanted
the most.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.569
*

36:23.340 --> 36:24.898
Who are you?

36:25.950 --> 36:28.077
I'm Davis.

36:28.110 --> 36:30.146
It's okay.
You're safe now.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.818
Why are you helping me?

36:31.850 --> 36:32.817
(sighs)

36:32.850 --> 36:36.411
(dramatic music)

36:36.460 --> 36:40.089
He can't keep hurting people
like this.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.724
It's not right.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.422
After Ren, I...

36:45.470 --> 36:48.064
I had to stop him.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.034
There's no one else that will.

36:50.070 --> 36:56.077
*

37:07.820 --> 37:11.722
Huevos, chorizo,
and jalapeo.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.297
It'll help you heal faster.

37:14.330 --> 37:15.820
I'm--I'm not hungry.

37:24.770 --> 37:26.738
I know you hate me, Tony,

37:26.770 --> 37:29.898
but I need to
tell you something.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.909
(moody music)

37:32.950 --> 37:36.374
You stood up for Teresa.

37:36.420 --> 37:39.617
Doesn't matter
the way it went down.

37:39.650 --> 37:41.413
You are a man.

37:41.460 --> 37:47.979
*

37:48.030 --> 37:49.725
(sighs)

37:49.760 --> 37:53.491
I thought I could do it.

37:53.530 --> 37:56.567
You know, I wanted
to do it, but...

37:56.600 --> 37:58.602
*

37:58.640 --> 38:00.505
I just couldn't.

38:00.540 --> 38:04.340
*

38:04.380 --> 38:07.201
A pistola doesn't make you
a man.

38:08.680 --> 38:12.184
Sacrifice does,

38:12.220 --> 38:13.346
and you were willing

38:13.390 --> 38:15.153
to lose your life for her.

38:15.190 --> 38:18.318
*

38:22.030 --> 38:28.890
*

38:36.010 --> 38:37.534
TONY: I wanted to be
like my dad.

38:37.580 --> 38:40.606
*

38:40.650 --> 38:43.175
But I'm not a soldier, Pote.

38:43.220 --> 38:46.519
*

38:46.550 --> 38:48.017
I wouldn't know that
if you hadn't trusted me

38:48.050 --> 38:49.608
with this.

38:49.660 --> 38:53.687
*

38:53.730 --> 38:55.129
I don't want this now.

38:55.160 --> 39:01.736
*

39:12.780 --> 39:14.338
Orale, Tony.

39:14.380 --> 39:21.240
*

39:29.460 --> 39:31.394
I'm proud of you, mi'jo.

39:31.430 --> 39:38.233
*

39:38.270 --> 39:40.738
Um, uh, I'm sorry.
C-can I have your cell phone?

39:40.770 --> 39:42.237
I need to call my boyfriend.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.236
Sure.
Here you go.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.247
See, thank you, thank you,

39:45.280 --> 39:47.703
thank you, thank you.

39:47.750 --> 39:48.739
(police siren beeps)

39:49.820 --> 39:51.412
DAVIS: Damn it!

39:51.450 --> 39:52.678
Oh, my God.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.119
The police?

39:54.150 --> 39:55.913
It's okay.
I'll talk to them.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.281
D-don't—-don't stop.
Don't stop. Just keep going.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.981
-Please, don't stop.
-It's okay.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.228
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no,

40:07.270 --> 40:08.862
-no, no, no, no, no!
-Oh, my God.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.265
-Oh, my God.
-No.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.699
No, just let her go, Randall!

40:17.740 --> 40:19.571
Stop it!

40:19.610 --> 40:21.373
No.

40:21.410 --> 40:24.447
What are you trying
to prove, son?

40:24.490 --> 40:26.219
EMILIA: (sobbing)

40:26.250 --> 40:27.444
(dramatic music)

40:27.490 --> 40:30.311
You can't fool me.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.055
I know who you really are.

40:32.090 --> 40:34.058
(gunshot)

40:34.090 --> 40:35.819
*

40:35.860 --> 40:37.896
That's what happens

40:37.930 --> 40:39.295
when you mess with things

40:39.330 --> 40:41.798
you don't understand, son.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.933
(whimpers)

40:43.970 --> 40:48.066
(crying)

40:48.110 --> 40:51.079
(line trilling)

40:51.110 --> 40:56.969
*

40:57.020 --> 40:58.146
EMILIA (on phone):
Hola. Soy Emilia.

40:58.180 --> 40:59.738
Ahorita note puedo contestar.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.917
-Djame un mensaje.
-(phone beeps)

41:01.960 --> 41:08.820
*

41:10.160 --> 41:11.969
Adios, Emilia.

41:12.000 --> 41:18.860
*

41:53.240 --> 41:56.209
(dramatic music)

41:56.240 --> 42:03.112
*

42:07.550 --> 42:10.553
(keys clacking, bell dings)
