WEBVTT

00:03.628 --> 00:07.353
Looking to the 101
eastbound. Traffic is moving slow.

00:07.377 --> 00:09.897
Starts to slow down
around White Oak.

00:09.921 --> 00:13.343
Northbound on 101.
Dark blue Tahoe, 6A 18 is Code 3.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.782
Requesting backup.

00:16.806 --> 00:21.079
DMV tag is 5ZEN 197.

00:21.103 --> 00:23.512
Two suspects in vehicle
fleeing traffic stop.

00:24.899 --> 00:29.027
6A27 shows responding
Code 3 with secondary with 6A 18.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.315
All units, vehicle
now heading west on Mulholland.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.335
Pull up right behind him.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.123
Out of the car!

00:53.344 --> 00:55.562
Out of the car!

00:55.586 --> 00:57.507
Driver, show me your hands!

00:58.141 --> 01:00.572
Out of the car!
Your hands. Get them up.

01:00.596 --> 01:01.859
Show me your hands!

01:01.883 --> 01:03.448
Passenger side, out the car.

01:03.472 --> 01:06.766
- Put them up! Get them up!
- Passenger side, get down.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.977
- Weapon!
- Take him out.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.789
- Secure the vehicle.
- Secured.

02:09.836 --> 02:11.272
G! Stay with me, G.

02:11.296 --> 02:14.382
Don't do this to me. Come on.
Come on, buddy.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.921
Here you go.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.444
So, what is it this time, G?

03:00.468 --> 03:04.054
- Cold showers, bed bugs, feng shui?
- Too noisy.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.108
Last place was too quiet.
Place before that was too hot.

03:07.132 --> 03:10.739
No, no, no. That place was too cold.
The place before that was too hot.

03:10.763 --> 03:12.269
Sure you're ready to come back?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.438
What are you,
my mother or something?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.644
You could use one.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.303
- Yeah.
- I gotcha.

03:25.327 --> 03:26.907
Thank you.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.666
- So new office, huh?
- Yup.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.000
- What's it like?
- Noisy.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.027
Three months and the neighbours
still don't know we're here.

03:49.051 --> 03:52.265
Huh. Hiding in plain sight.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.999
What was it before we got it?

03:55.023 --> 03:57.648
Old water plant
administration building.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.525
Condemned
after the Northridge quake.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.284
- Condemned?
- Only on the outside, G.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.873
Coming through.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.838
Great, just put it on my desk.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.344
VoilÅ•.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.636
Gotta go see you-know-who.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.697
Come on, Hetty.
I gave you the receipts.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.182
If every agent came back
from an undercover assignment

04:53.206 --> 04:56.388
with expenses unaccounted for,
Mr. Hanna,

04:56.412 --> 05:00.087
I'd be either out of a job
or out of pocket.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.310
Now I don't intend to be either.

05:02.334 --> 05:04.728
What are we down to,
15, 20 bucks?

05:04.752 --> 05:07.598
Sixty-one and a nickel.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.595
You're a fantastic
operations manager, Hetty.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.870
- All right.
- Yeah. I got you.

05:15.894 --> 05:18.556
- Twenty, 40, 60.
- Yeah.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.784
- Okay?
- Thank you.

05:21.808 --> 05:23.648
I'll spot you the nickel.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.232
Thank you. I'm good for it.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.576
Mr. Callen,
you're not due back for a month.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.785
I missed your sunny smile, Hetty.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.827
Um... We need to update
your biometrics.

05:39.338 --> 05:42.481
New photos for driver's licences,
passports,

05:42.505 --> 05:45.771
general backstopping,
not to speak of documents,

05:45.795 --> 05:47.571
credit cards and so forth,

05:47.595 --> 05:51.049
and, um, wardrobe.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.390
Problems with the neighbours?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.432
Something like that.

06:01.486 --> 06:07.025
Well, don't even think about unrolling
that disgusting thing in here.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.703
- I think she's mellowed.
- I think I'm in love.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.561
Who's that?

06:18.585 --> 06:21.244
It's a new guy
that started this week. Green.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.379
- That's his name?
- Nope.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.293
Heads up, director's coming online.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.088
- Hey, Callen.
- Eric.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.643
Well, it's about time.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.116
- Kensi.
- Hello.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.779
- My favourite agent.
- I thought you callously abandoned us

06:38.803 --> 06:40.061
to join the FBI.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.876
Once was enough. You still making
the weekend drive up to Pendleton?

06:43.900 --> 06:46.122
Of course. Home away from home.

06:46.146 --> 06:48.089
What you get
for growing up a Marine brat.

06:48.113 --> 06:50.358
- Yeah, yeah.
- You get a note from your doctor?

06:50.660 --> 06:51.964
- You're my doctor, Nate.
- Yeah.

06:51.988 --> 06:53.964
I just get to play around inside
your head though.

06:53.988 --> 06:55.468
How's the rest of you?

06:55.492 --> 06:56.921
Aches, pains, insomnia?

06:56.945 --> 06:59.307
Yeah, all of that. Before I was shot.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.305
Hi. Dominic.

07:01.329 --> 07:03.959
Callen. Nice to meet you, Dom.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.806
- Is Callen his first?
- Just Callen.

07:06.830 --> 07:08.504
I got it.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.374
Agent Callen,

07:21.398 --> 07:23.618
I didn't think you were due back
till next month.

07:23.642 --> 07:27.436
- I guess you didn't get the e-mail.
- I guess you haven't sent it yet.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.657
Your case is still active, Callen.
We will find them.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.398
Yes, sir.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.621
- We will.
- Here's the reason I'm calling.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.510
This is Commander Frank McGuire,

07:39.534 --> 07:41.428
works for the Office
of Naval Intelligence.

07:41.452 --> 07:43.311
Or did until two hours ago.

07:43.335 --> 07:45.603
He was kidnapped
and subsequently killed

07:45.627 --> 07:47.149
in a shootout with L.A.P.D.

07:47.173 --> 07:51.090
Routine traffic stop, his kidnappers
sped off, L.A.P.D. Went after them.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.024
McGuire got caught in the crossfire.

07:53.048 --> 07:54.574
What about the kidnappers?

07:54.598 --> 07:55.904
Mexican nationals.

07:55.928 --> 07:57.535
That's what's got us worried.

07:57.559 --> 08:01.202
In less than 12 hours, there's going
to be a coordinated military operation

08:01.226 --> 08:04.351
on both sides of the Mexican border
against the drug cartels.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.990
Operation Dakota.

08:06.014 --> 08:08.566
McGuire had detailed knowledge
of this plan.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.772
We need to find out if it's been
compromised. File's on its way, Eric.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.660
Keep me in the loop.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.456
Footage, Eric.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.710
Eric, slide it back.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.751
Hold it. Dom.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.429
- What do you see?
- Uh...

08:37.683 --> 08:40.150
The second guy's been hit,
he's trying to get back in the SUV.

08:40.174 --> 08:43.886
- Okay. Why?
- Cover?

08:44.732 --> 08:46.440
Zoom and enhance, Eric.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.454
Passenger side window
just exploded.

08:50.478 --> 08:53.418
Yeah, but that's not a surprise.
Lots of incoming from the L.A.P.D.

08:53.442 --> 08:54.731
Tighter, Eric.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.579
Advance three frames.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.159
The window is blowing
into the car, not out.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.452
- The kidnapper fired the shot.
- McGuire wasn't killed in the crossfire.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.211
He was executed.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.333
Okay, so you're a bad guy.

09:21.357 --> 09:23.247
You're surrounded by L.A.P.D.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.545
You've seen the movies.
Gonna shoot your way out.

09:25.569 --> 09:28.836
Your buddy takes one in the chest,
he's dead before he hits the ground.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.635
I think I've seen that movie.

09:30.659 --> 09:34.422
Blam,
blam! Six cops squeezing Glocks.

09:34.446 --> 09:36.639
That's a lead storm.
It's coming right at you.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.017
Definitely ain't no movie.
What do you do?

09:39.041 --> 09:40.492
Al Pacino was in it.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.395
- Might have been De Niro.
- You pee your pants.

09:43.419 --> 09:45.465
You drop your weapon.
You kiss the pavement.

09:45.968 --> 09:47.249
Okay?

09:47.678 --> 09:49.718
At least that's what I'd do.

09:52.100 --> 09:56.477
Instead, I go back to the car,
execute the hostage, and die doing it.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.493
Now why would you sacrifice yourself
to kill your hostage?

09:59.517 --> 10:02.016
So he couldn't reveal
what you were up to.

10:03.528 --> 10:05.520
McGuire lives at 1041, Apartment 1.

10:05.863 --> 10:07.903
What are we?

10:08.616 --> 10:11.083
- If anyone asks.
- City inspectors.

10:11.107 --> 10:13.053
- Nobody talks to city inspectors.
- Okay.

10:13.077 --> 10:14.930
You're a realtor, I'm your client.

10:14.954 --> 10:18.432
- Do I look like a realtor?
- Okay, I'm the realtor.

10:18.456 --> 10:20.334
You're looking for the apartment,
okay?

10:20.628 --> 10:23.297
- Can we go?
- Would I live in a place like this?

10:23.506 --> 10:25.664
I don't even know
if I could afford a place like this.

10:26.050 --> 10:28.315
Well, that's why I'm showing you,

10:28.339 --> 10:32.401
to see if, you know, you would
wanna live in a place like this.

10:32.425 --> 10:35.932
- Does it have a Jacuzzi?
- If it has, I'm gonna drown you in it.

10:45.987 --> 10:47.671
Hi, this is Frank McGuire.

10:47.695 --> 10:49.797
Sorry I can't take your call right now.

10:49.821 --> 10:53.075
Leave a message
and I'll get right back with you.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.874
- Clear.
- Clear.

11:08.342 --> 11:10.276
Message bank deleted.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.506
Looks like someone didn't want us
to hear McGuire's messages.

11:15.516 --> 11:18.030
Eric, I need you to check a call.

11:18.054 --> 11:20.362
I'll check McGuire's phone logs,
see what we turn up.

11:20.386 --> 11:24.774
Okay, McGuire graduated top 1 percent
from the Naval Academy. Wow.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.001
Look at this. Stellar career.

11:27.025 --> 11:29.044
Specialized
in satellite-image analysis.

11:29.068 --> 11:31.123
And spent time
in the San Nicolas Navy Base.

11:31.147 --> 11:34.585
- Where's that?
- 75 miles off the coast of L.A.

11:34.609 --> 11:37.455
It was discovered by a Spanish
explorer, Sebastian Vizcaino.

11:37.788 --> 11:40.220
Now, he actually chartered
the entire California coast.

11:40.244 --> 11:41.886
And his ship was called
the San Diego

11:41.910 --> 11:44.754
which is where the bay gets its name,
of course.

11:45.463 --> 11:48.583
I think that was back in, what, 1602?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.422
- I read a lot.
- Reading is good.

12:03.314 --> 12:05.639
I found this on the coffee table.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.941
Like it mattered.

12:10.488 --> 12:13.358
"Emma. Fleet week. San Diego."

12:14.492 --> 12:18.110
- McGuire wasn't married.
- Birthday was two months ago.

12:19.163 --> 12:21.013
How long you leave birthday cards
on display?

12:21.037 --> 12:23.590
I don't know. I never got one.

12:23.614 --> 12:25.512
You've never gotten
a single birthday card?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.087
Nope.

12:30.007 --> 12:31.810
What? It's not a big deal.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.978
Definitely getting you a birthday card
this year.

12:34.002 --> 12:36.420
Great. You make sure
you put some money in it.

12:36.722 --> 12:38.264
How about I put a personality in it?

12:41.519 --> 12:45.160
"Happy birthday to my favourite uncle.
Love, Emma."

12:45.184 --> 12:48.939
- Mystery solved.
- Mystery solved.

12:50.111 --> 12:51.664
No signs of struggle.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.522
Deadbolts on all the windows
and doors.

12:53.864 --> 12:56.023
They must have snatched him
off the street.

12:59.954 --> 13:03.465
Laptop's encrypted.
It's a job for Eric.

13:03.489 --> 13:06.477
For a career Navy guy, Commander
McGuire wasn't very squared away.

13:06.501 --> 13:09.160
Unless he had something else
on his mind.

13:12.842 --> 13:14.442
No Jacuzzi.

13:14.466 --> 13:16.651
- Deal breaker?
- Afraid so.

13:16.675 --> 13:19.930
Aww. There goes my commission.

13:27.189 --> 13:28.767
The gardener included in the lease?

13:50.087 --> 13:52.459
SÃ­, it is.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.187
Very safe.

13:54.211 --> 13:56.815
This Navy guy,
I looked at his apartment

13:56.839 --> 14:00.012
and, well, he was kidnapped,
murdered.

14:01.891 --> 14:04.702
- Did you know him?
- Oh, every day, he waves.

14:04.726 --> 14:07.136
I saw him this morning. He's dead?

14:07.730 --> 14:09.438
And already his apartment's
available.

14:10.775 --> 14:12.851
Unbelievable.

14:15.529 --> 14:17.628
You might've been the last person
to see him alive.

14:17.652 --> 14:19.199
No, he was with his friends.

14:19.617 --> 14:21.217
What if they're ones
that kidnapped him?

14:21.241 --> 14:23.011
No, no, no. They were his friends.

14:23.035 --> 14:26.465
They've been here before.
I see their car, the blue Tahoe.

14:26.489 --> 14:28.124
- Blue Tahoe? When?
- Yeah.

14:29.251 --> 14:30.496
Every day this week.

15:04.412 --> 15:08.409
- Did you get the plates?
- It was clean.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.497
It turns out it wasn't McGuire's first trip
in the Tahoe.

15:12.086 --> 15:14.387
He knew them. They picked him up
every morning this week,

15:14.411 --> 15:17.044
dropped him off three hours later.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.708
Sound like a kidnapping to you,
Sam?

15:27.935 --> 15:30.663
Looks like a kidnapping, but it's not.
Why the hood and nylon ties?

15:30.687 --> 15:32.740
Don't want him to see
where they're taking him,

15:32.764 --> 15:35.703
so they tie his hands so he's
not tempted to lift the hood and peek.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.502
It's common practise
in the Middle East.

15:37.526 --> 15:39.734
I've used the technique
a few times myself.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.094
Now, McGuire used to get to the office
around 8:30,

15:46.118 --> 15:47.805
give or take five or ten minutes.

15:47.829 --> 15:50.298
But as you can see,
he was late every day this week.

15:50.322 --> 15:52.468
The gardener said they picked him up
at 7:30.

15:52.492 --> 15:54.553
Three hours later,
they dropped him back home,

15:54.577 --> 15:57.434
- and then he goes to work.
- A lot you can do in three hours.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.505
If you have top secret
security clearance.

15:59.884 --> 16:01.212
How much time do we have, Eric?

16:01.677 --> 16:03.895
Operation Dakota
against the drug cartels

16:03.919 --> 16:06.195
kicks off
in seven hours and 33 minutes.

16:06.219 --> 16:08.158
What about the call
to McGuire's apartment?

16:08.182 --> 16:09.737
I'm still working on it.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.738
- Finances?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.491
- Travel?
- Nothing in his name

16:13.515 --> 16:14.994
or any of his known credit cards.

16:15.018 --> 16:17.574
- Family, relatives?
- Parents are deceased.

16:17.598 --> 16:19.959
He's got one sister, Helen McGuire.

16:19.983 --> 16:22.668
Lives in West Hollywood,
divorced, one kid.

16:22.692 --> 16:24.324
- A girl.
- Emma.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.989
Photo at the apartment.
Her favourite uncle.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.080
All right. Enough with the look, already.
I'll go.

16:39.423 --> 16:43.646
And I will take our trained expert
operational psychologist for backup.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.851
I love field work.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.607
- Do I get to carry a gun?
- Yeah, no.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.297
I don't think we're expecting trouble
from a grieving family.

16:49.683 --> 16:52.221
Can I still carry a gun?
Wear one of those ankle holsters?

16:54.063 --> 16:56.898
- Maybe that'd make me walk funny.
- You already walk funny, Nate.

16:57.441 --> 17:00.122
- Where are we with friends or lovers?
- There's one standout.

17:00.146 --> 17:01.837
- A guy.
- Friend or lover?

17:01.861 --> 17:04.496
Not really the question
that jumped out at me.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.872
Informed guess.

17:05.896 --> 17:10.179
He's a 6-foot-3, 200-pound
Special Forces paratrooper guy,

17:10.203 --> 17:12.838
- so I'm leaning towards a friend.
- Good call, Dom.

17:12.862 --> 17:15.661
Got a hit on that phone number.
Details coming up.

17:16.042 --> 17:18.451
Same number used to call in
and erase McGuire's voice mail,

17:18.878 --> 17:21.429
also called him 15 times
in the last four days.

17:21.453 --> 17:23.233
Somebody's trying
to cover their tracks,

17:23.257 --> 17:25.608
distance themselves
from the investigation.

17:25.632 --> 17:27.936
Who is he? Who made those calls?

17:27.961 --> 17:29.218
That's him.

17:29.807 --> 17:33.176
The Special Forces paratrooper guy.
He runs a private security firm.

17:34.395 --> 17:37.953
Bobby J. Jenlow and Associates.
What do the associates do?

17:37.977 --> 17:40.307
Anything Bobby J. Jenlow
tells them to.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.270
No plates.

17:44.738 --> 17:46.530
Small world.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.053
Are you listening to me, Eddie?

17:51.077 --> 17:53.297
No. No. You listen to me.

17:53.321 --> 17:55.133
It's called standing up, okay?

17:55.157 --> 17:58.250
It's called standing up for your
brothers. That's all I'm asking.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.961
Just do it for me. Just do it.

18:09.805 --> 18:12.486
- You run pretty good.
- Nice handbrake turn.

18:12.510 --> 18:15.826
- You gonna badge me?
- Make a difference if we do?

18:15.850 --> 18:17.905
I saw you going in.
I didn't know who you were.

18:17.929 --> 18:21.580
- So you cleared the phones remotely.
- Private conversations.

18:21.604 --> 18:23.815
- Every one.
- Close?

18:25.404 --> 18:27.538
- Since we were kids.
- It's gotta hurt,

18:27.562 --> 18:30.088
knowing one of your buddies
was betraying his country.

18:30.112 --> 18:33.036
He was kidnapped.
He was no traitor.

18:34.872 --> 18:38.157
- You guys don't know anything.
- Know he wasn't kidnapped.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.479
We know he's been working with them
for the better part of a week.

18:41.503 --> 18:43.212
We know he was shot
to shut him up.

18:45.633 --> 18:48.337
- What do you know, Bobby?
- Nothing.

18:50.721 --> 18:51.895
You're special ops.

18:51.919 --> 18:53.983
It's funny how we all know
just by looking.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.642
Me, I was a SEAL.

19:01.523 --> 19:04.145
You planning a little hunting party,
Bobby?

19:05.569 --> 19:06.850
We're done.

19:22.169 --> 19:24.980
Jenlow could compromise
the operation against the cartels.

19:25.004 --> 19:27.877
He's putting together a team
to go after them. Retribution.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.922
- How long do we have?
- Not long.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.988
I've sent everyone home.

19:34.012 --> 19:38.321
- All my friends. I wanted to be alone.
- When did you last see your brother?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.428
- Thank you.
- The weekend.

19:41.021 --> 19:43.856
Frank took Emma
to the farmer's market.

19:44.441 --> 19:48.605
The beach, the movies.

19:49.738 --> 19:54.341
After we divorced, Emma's father,
Luis, moved overseas.

19:54.365 --> 19:56.171
So Frank became the man
in her life.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.385
You speak to your brother
on the phone this week?

19:58.409 --> 19:59.588
No.

19:59.612 --> 20:01.723
Did he mention he was worried
about something?

20:01.747 --> 20:02.996
Nothing.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.210
Everything was normal and then...

20:10.301 --> 20:13.136
- Will you excuse me?
- Sure.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.947
You know, you can tell a lot
about people from their fridge.

20:18.971 --> 20:20.743
And not just what's on the inside.

20:20.767 --> 20:23.012
Outside tells a story too.

20:23.814 --> 20:25.617
- She's grieving.
- Yes, she is.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.208
Which is normal
considering the circumstances.

20:29.232 --> 20:31.526
- Absolutely.
- So what?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.322
Tell me.

20:34.408 --> 20:35.439
She's on edge.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.420
Answering way too quickly.

20:38.444 --> 20:42.297
Particularly to direct questions
requiring a simple yes or no.

20:42.321 --> 20:43.875
Mostly she's saying no.

20:45.169 --> 20:48.538
Kensi, everything that woman
just told us was a lie.

20:54.636 --> 20:58.385
Mr. Callen. A moment?

21:00.351 --> 21:01.631
You want some backup?

21:07.358 --> 21:09.434
Your hand.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.566
Eye.

21:19.161 --> 21:22.838
Car. Blue '07 Impala.

21:22.862 --> 21:24.296
Modified the engine,

21:24.320 --> 21:27.346
upgraded the brakes,
transmission, suspension.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.659
Fitted with 19-inch wheels.

21:29.546 --> 21:31.622
And latest smart technology:

21:32.299 --> 21:35.691
3G network
with two four-megapixel cameras,

21:35.715 --> 21:39.148
updated microphone,
32-gig flash drive,

21:39.172 --> 21:43.867
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mini-USB slot,
and of course, GPS.

21:43.891 --> 21:45.317
And it's encrypted.

21:45.341 --> 21:48.475
And so please don't forget your pin
this time.

21:49.983 --> 21:53.791
Let's go. Now wardrobe
for your undercover work.

21:53.815 --> 21:55.921
I know you grew up
in the well-meaning

21:55.945 --> 21:59.566
but cold embrace of the welfare state,
Mr. Callen.

21:59.952 --> 22:03.297
But just because you were an orphan
doesn't mean that you have to dress

22:03.321 --> 22:05.430
like Oliver Twist.

22:05.454 --> 22:10.619
Now, we need something modern,
individual

22:11.171 --> 22:14.042
that speaks to the man within.

22:18.011 --> 22:21.843
That's not for you to admire,
it's for you to try on.

22:22.808 --> 22:25.785
Here and here.

22:25.809 --> 22:27.911
And here.

22:27.935 --> 22:30.181
- This or this?
- Those.

22:30.649 --> 22:34.100
Fitted boot jean, medium weight,
distressed denim.

22:34.403 --> 22:38.566
I think we need something
more relaxed, Mr. Callen.

22:45.247 --> 22:47.074
Something amuses you?

22:49.001 --> 22:52.121
Oh, it's just that in three years
you've never called me G.

22:54.339 --> 22:57.340
It's not a name. It's a letter.

22:58.969 --> 23:02.753
Now. If you were to tell me
what the G stands for...

23:04.808 --> 23:06.184
No one ever told me.

23:14.735 --> 23:17.747
- Tell me that's good news, Eric.
- Uh. That's good news.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.674
And that
is Commander McGuire's laptop.

23:20.698 --> 23:22.336
- Oh, you got in.
- I got in.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.633
Me and about a hundred thousand
zombie computers.

23:24.657 --> 23:26.596
I hacked into an illegal
botnet system,

23:26.620 --> 23:29.244
redirected the computing power
into cracking the encryption.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.683
Couple of minutes
and we'll get to peek inside

23:31.707 --> 23:35.080
- all of McGuire's dirty little secrets.
- All right, guys.

23:36.256 --> 23:38.059
Nate thinks McGuire's sister
is lying to us,

23:38.083 --> 23:41.734
that she knew what her brother was
doing. I think there's something else.

23:41.758 --> 23:44.230
It's like the kind of raw emotion
that you see in someone

23:44.254 --> 23:46.151
when the nightmare's still enfolding.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.117
It's like it was still happening to her.

23:48.141 --> 23:49.946
Same time every morning,

23:49.970 --> 23:53.288
they pick him up, cover his face
and take him somewhere.

23:53.312 --> 23:55.415
So why would someone
betray their country?

23:55.439 --> 23:59.607
- Ideology. Greed.
- Love.

24:02.282 --> 24:03.421
Oh, my God, it's her.

24:03.445 --> 24:05.740
- McGuire's sister?
- No, his niece.

24:06.119 --> 24:08.693
Eric, buddiesbook entry
for Emma McGuire, West Hollywood.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.385
Coming in five.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.467
She said she wanted to be alone.

24:12.491 --> 24:14.328
Callen, her daughter
wasn't even with her.

24:15.671 --> 24:16.702
All right, here we go.

24:18.340 --> 24:21.234
Emma's been sending messages
to her friends every single day.

24:21.258 --> 24:23.976
- And then come this week...
- No messages.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.278
Nothing.
She hasn't logged on for four days.

24:26.302 --> 24:28.489
So whatever they've been getting
McGuire to do,

24:28.513 --> 24:30.569
this is how they've been forcing him
to do it.

24:30.593 --> 24:34.055
This is why she's still living it.
It's still happening.

24:36.066 --> 24:37.311
They have her daughter.

24:46.911 --> 24:51.703
Coming in three, two, one, bingo.

24:51.728 --> 24:53.868
We just opened
four encrypted e-mails

24:53.892 --> 24:56.416
sent to McGuire's laptop
over the last four days.

24:56.440 --> 24:59.162
Sequential time code
is within an hour of the download.

24:59.186 --> 25:01.630
They were downlinked direct
from one of our satellites.

25:01.654 --> 25:04.838
McGuire downlinks the satellite images
to the main computer

25:04.862 --> 25:07.172
and then secretly e-mails them
to his own laptop.

25:07.196 --> 25:09.674
Recording everything
they were making him steal.

25:09.698 --> 25:12.389
There's the San Diego Bay,
Army bases,

25:12.413 --> 25:14.685
border crossing, border security.

25:14.709 --> 25:17.526
- Eric, get me Vance.
- Got it.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.528
How did the drug cartels find out
McGuire even had satellite access?

25:20.552 --> 25:22.238
It was a joint military operation.

25:22.262 --> 25:24.422
The leak probably came
from south of the border.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.824
Cartel sets up a satellite uplink,

25:26.848 --> 25:29.070
kidnaps his niece Emma,
who's still missing,

25:29.094 --> 25:31.737
knowing they'll do anything
that they ask and not tell anyone.

25:31.761 --> 25:34.999
- He did tell someone.
- Bobby Jenlow.

25:35.023 --> 25:38.668
He was gonna try to rescue her.
Probably gave McGuire a GPS locator.

25:38.692 --> 25:41.330
- Gotta find Jenlow, Eric.
- I'm already on it.

25:41.354 --> 25:43.026
And director's online.

25:45.036 --> 25:46.043
What do you got, Callen?

25:46.067 --> 25:48.048
Operation Dakota's
been compromised.

25:48.072 --> 25:51.390
Mexican drug cartel forced McGuire
to access one of our satellites.

25:51.414 --> 25:53.576
- Forced?
- Kidnapped his niece.

25:54.795 --> 25:55.910
She's still missing.

25:57.340 --> 26:00.435
It's too late to stop Dakota.
You've got to find out which cartel.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.129
We'll hit them first.

26:02.470 --> 26:05.862
You have less than four hours.

26:05.886 --> 26:09.971
And Callen, the girl is a priority.

26:11.020 --> 26:14.389
Jenlow's cell phone is on.
And I've got him. Hollywood Hills.

26:15.149 --> 26:17.521
Kensi, McGuire's sister.

26:28.412 --> 26:31.746
- You know.
- We put the pieces together.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.413
- I'm sorry, Helen.
- Come in.

26:35.086 --> 26:38.170
I wanted to tell you
but Bobby wouldn't let me.

26:39.090 --> 26:40.584
He's going there to bring her back.

26:41.092 --> 26:42.918
- When?
- Now.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.987
Hey, Sam. It's me.
I'm with Helen McGuire.

26:47.011 --> 26:50.158
- Bobby Jenlow's on his way in.
- Copy that.

26:50.182 --> 26:51.951
First turn off Viewpoint Road. Got it.

26:51.975 --> 26:53.971
All right, we're ten minutes out.
Transmitting.

26:55.356 --> 26:57.847
Stand by, picture's up.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.484
He is gonna get another ticket.

27:05.491 --> 27:08.384
- Have they contacted you?
- No.

27:08.408 --> 27:12.527
If they do, I want you to keep talking
to them so we can trace the call, okay?

27:12.748 --> 27:15.927
They were at the market. One minute,
Emma was standing right next to him,

27:15.951 --> 27:18.807
the next, Frank turned around
and she was just gone.

27:18.831 --> 27:21.353
- How did they contact him?
- Cell phone.

27:21.377 --> 27:23.126
A couple minutes
after she disappeared.

27:23.759 --> 27:26.024
They told him what they wanted him
to do, he agreed.

27:26.048 --> 27:29.671
- Have they let you speak to her?
- No.

27:31.934 --> 27:34.935
Bobby got Frank a GPS transmitter.
Frank put it in the cartel's house.

27:37.398 --> 27:39.687
He gave up his life for my daughter.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.320
The turn's up ahead, Sam.

27:53.664 --> 27:55.300
You feeling lucky?

27:55.324 --> 27:57.871
After last time? Not particularly.

28:05.843 --> 28:07.503
Here we go.

28:10.848 --> 28:12.675
That's not Jenlow. Look out!

29:11.242 --> 29:12.617
It's okay, Bobby.

29:13.494 --> 29:15.533
Emma. Get Emma.

29:19.500 --> 29:23.545
Eric, ambulance.
Sam and I are fine.

29:28.050 --> 29:29.544
She's not here.

29:52.174 --> 29:54.142
Find her.

29:54.166 --> 29:57.130
Please, just find her.

30:04.352 --> 30:07.863
- Any idea on our two amigos?
- All cashed up, no ID.

30:07.887 --> 30:10.187
Well, the car had a GPS
tracking system.

30:12.152 --> 30:13.243
Previous destinations.

30:13.267 --> 30:16.648
There's only two with repeat journeys.
This one and one in Malibu. Hey, Eric?

30:16.990 --> 30:21.284
Yeah, give me everything you've got on
1727 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu.

30:22.412 --> 30:25.757
Okay, house is owned
by PPZ Investments.

30:25.781 --> 30:30.915
It's a trust, which in turn is owned
by a guy named Manny Cortez.

30:31.213 --> 30:32.588
Mad Manny Cortez?

30:32.923 --> 30:37.146
It doesn't describe him as mad
in the SEC filing, but if you say so.

30:37.170 --> 30:39.111
We found our cartel.

30:39.135 --> 30:40.443
Who's Manny Cortez?

30:40.467 --> 30:43.640
Just a mass-murdering drug lord
with a classic Oedipus complex.

30:44.601 --> 30:47.685
Last bit's an educated guess.
I'd have to talk to him to be certain.

30:48.355 --> 30:51.534
Manny and his father ran one
of the largest drug cartels in Mexico.

30:51.558 --> 30:52.907
And now it's just him.

30:52.931 --> 30:55.576
- What happened to his father?
- According to legend,

30:55.600 --> 30:57.831
Manny cut off his toes
with a pair of bolt cutters,

30:57.855 --> 31:00.866
then his fingers,
and then some other bits.

31:01.576 --> 31:03.118
Cool.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.101
Helen...

31:10.125 --> 31:11.325
I'm sorry.

31:11.711 --> 31:13.751
Emma wasn't at the house.

31:16.341 --> 31:19.234
- Bobby?
- He's on his way to the ER.

31:19.258 --> 31:22.428
Gunshot wound,
but I think he's gonna be okay.

31:30.730 --> 31:33.767
- Hello?
- It's Luis. Any news?

31:34.109 --> 31:35.769
It's my ex, Emma's dad.

31:36.861 --> 31:39.755
- Hello, Luis. There's no news.
- Helen.

31:39.779 --> 31:42.486
- Emma's still...
- What about Emma?

31:42.993 --> 31:45.092
Please, you just need to tell me
what's happening.

31:45.116 --> 31:47.956
Luis, l...

31:49.374 --> 31:52.126
Excuse me. Could you?

31:55.922 --> 31:57.630
- Mr. Perez?
- Who is this?

31:58.216 --> 32:00.517
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.296
Oh, jeez.

32:02.762 --> 32:03.818
I'd like to reassure you

32:03.842 --> 32:06.659
that we are doing everything we can
to get your little girl back.

32:06.683 --> 32:08.450
Helen didn't tell me
until this morning.

32:08.474 --> 32:10.576
I'm booked on the next flight
out of London.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.866
You promise me
you'll do everything to find her.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.224
Everything. You hear me?

32:16.610 --> 32:19.694
- Yes, sir. I hear you.
- Thank you.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.404
Emma adores her father.

32:26.828 --> 32:31.040
He only just gets back in town
a couple times a year.

32:32.042 --> 32:33.999
We're planning
on having Thanksgiving together.

32:49.059 --> 32:50.992
What do you think it'd take
to storm that place?

32:51.016 --> 32:52.929
A week's planning and a small army.

32:53.313 --> 32:55.352
Could be too late, G.

33:00.654 --> 33:05.031
Nate, the girl,
you think she's still alive?

33:05.784 --> 33:09.045
The moment McGuire was killed,
she became a liability.

33:09.069 --> 33:11.298
Now, psychologically,

33:11.322 --> 33:14.949
the fact that she's a child
makes the decision harder.

33:16.544 --> 33:18.928
But, eventually,
self-interest usually wins through.

33:18.952 --> 33:21.170
If she's still alive,
she's running out of time.

33:24.052 --> 33:25.439
We need a plan.

33:25.463 --> 33:27.487
Okay, we could send in
a tactical team.

33:27.511 --> 33:29.234
We need at least an hour
to get them.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.401
- We don't have an hour.
- Okay. Okay.

33:31.425 --> 33:35.195
Utility company, city engineer,
food delivery.

33:35.219 --> 33:37.116
If Manny Cortez is really there,

33:37.140 --> 33:41.183
the only way he's gonna invite us in
is if he thinks there's money in it.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.735
- What was that? Greek?
- Latin.

33:49.995 --> 33:53.090
- Give them what they want.
- Very good, Dominic.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.258
Though your declension
needs a little work.

33:55.282 --> 33:58.104
The pronoun is masculine, singular.

33:58.128 --> 34:00.453
Give him what he wants.

34:01.089 --> 34:05.502
So, what does this toe cutter want?

34:08.888 --> 34:10.596
Satellite access, 24/7.

34:14.143 --> 34:17.976
- Did you make the call, Nate?
- Yeah, he's expecting you.

34:21.067 --> 34:23.914
- Yeah, what do you want?
- I wanna do business.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.606
What sort of business?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.822
Satellite business.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.204
Game time.

34:50.472 --> 34:54.304
Okay, man. I'm good. No problem.

35:15.371 --> 35:18.491
- Who are you?
- Frank Hanley. I'm a lawyer.

35:19.626 --> 35:21.084
A lawyer needs a bodyguard?

35:23.046 --> 35:25.311
Oh, the big guy.
Big guy's actually my client.

35:25.335 --> 35:28.543
Works in the Defence Department,
civilian analyst.

35:29.135 --> 35:31.840
Actually, I just worked with a former
business partner of yours.

35:32.639 --> 35:35.485
Naval commander named McGuire.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.948
- Never heard of him.
- Really?

35:37.972 --> 35:40.327
Well, maybe you've heard
of his niece.

35:40.351 --> 35:41.553
Her name is Emma.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.826
McGuire shared some information
with my client.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.508
In less than three hours,
Operation Dakota begins.

36:03.532 --> 36:06.261
In less than one hour,
my client can have you back online.

36:06.285 --> 36:11.007
Real-time satellite imagery
of the Mexican border, 24/7.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.878
And how can your client do this?

36:18.017 --> 36:21.268
- It's a simple phone call.
- Picture's coming up.

36:24.190 --> 36:27.725
- Guys, that's not Manny Cortez.
- Then who is it?

36:30.363 --> 36:34.692
- I don't believe you.
- Daddy. Daddy.

36:40.165 --> 36:41.165
Hey.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.700
Is that who I think it is?

36:49.549 --> 36:50.936
- Kensi.
- Kensi,

36:50.960 --> 36:53.292
the father's behind this.
Emma's with him.

36:55.305 --> 36:57.854
Nate, he called here. He knows.

36:57.878 --> 37:01.200
- Luis knows we're NCIS.
- Operation's compromised.

37:01.224 --> 37:03.636
- He knows.
- Okay, well, we have to do something.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.870
- When can I call Mommy?
- Tomorrow, I promise.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.647
Now, Daddy's busy.

37:12.155 --> 37:14.456
Why don't you go have your swim
and I'll join soon, okay?

37:14.480 --> 37:17.148
- Okay.
- Give me a kiss. Bye-bye.

37:24.292 --> 37:27.743
- We all live a lie.
- Some a bigger lie than others.

37:28.213 --> 37:31.498
I spoke to one of your colleagues
on the phone.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.081
A distraught father.

37:34.135 --> 37:36.804
She was NCIS.
I assume you are too?

37:37.764 --> 37:39.946
How long have you been working
for Manny Cortez?

37:39.970 --> 37:42.632
Seven, eight years.

37:42.936 --> 37:44.893
A double life.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.974
You were McGuire's brother-in-law.

37:49.150 --> 37:51.143
He never thought I was good enough
for his sister.

37:51.528 --> 37:53.319
Yeah, he was right.

37:54.113 --> 37:56.129
You set him up to believe
his niece was kidnapped.

37:56.153 --> 38:00.191
She was. But by her father.

38:01.996 --> 38:03.325
She's not going back.

38:06.209 --> 38:07.240
Yeah, he's right there.

38:08.545 --> 38:10.145
It's McGuire.

38:10.169 --> 38:12.212
He's not really dead.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.408
Hey!

38:57.343 --> 39:00.130
- Thanks, Dom.
- You're welcome.

39:08.688 --> 39:12.104
Kensi, give her the phone.

39:15.486 --> 39:18.108
- Hello?
- It's for you.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.504
- Hello?
- Oh, baby.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.197
Oh, baby.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.323
Hi, Mommy.

39:27.915 --> 39:30.845
When can I come home?
I wanna come home.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.080
Well, you can come home right now.

39:38.343 --> 39:41.794
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

39:44.140 --> 39:46.892
Oh, sweetheart, I love you so much.

39:47.435 --> 39:49.344
I love you too, Mom.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.195
Expense accounts.

39:58.988 --> 40:01.751
You're six months behind.

40:01.775 --> 40:03.468
I would have thought

40:03.492 --> 40:06.305
that seeing as you had
so much time off for recuperation,

40:06.329 --> 40:09.307
you would have caught up
on your paperwork.

40:09.331 --> 40:11.183
Please tell me you're kidding me,
Hetty.

40:11.207 --> 40:14.376
Well, I could, but it would be a lie.

40:16.089 --> 40:19.292
No rush. Tomorrow will be fine.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.522
Night.

40:35.483 --> 40:38.437
Night, Dom, Kensi, Nate.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.120
Hey.

40:48.413 --> 40:51.164
- Sofa's free at my place.
- Noisy.

40:52.458 --> 40:54.451
Okay. Good night, G.

40:55.461 --> 40:56.955
Good night.

41:17.525 --> 41:18.605
And done.
