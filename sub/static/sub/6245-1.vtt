01:33.349 --> 01:37.553
<i>From the dawn of time,
the Wolff sen family</i>

01:37.555 --> 01:41.723
<i>has always taken the idea
of the pack very seriously.</i>

01:41.725 --> 01:46.428
<i>Rituals of binding members
together are bloody and sacred.</i>

01:48.364 --> 01:52.301
<i>But more unforgiving are
the ones who break that bond.</i>

01:54.370 --> 01:57.406
<i>All that matters is
who is in the family...</i>

01:57.408 --> 02:00.209
<i>and who is out.</i>

02:02.779 --> 02:05.414
<i>My father has always been
a fervent believer</i>

02:05.416 --> 02:07.483
<i>in the family lore.</i>

02:07.485 --> 02:11.820
You are part of the family.
My family!

02:11.822 --> 02:14.356
Now hold still, son.

02:16.659 --> 02:21.630
Now and forever,
I bind you to the wolf!

02:21.632 --> 02:26.235
<i>He was a very hard man
to live with.</i>

02:26.237 --> 02:30.272
<i>You don't just walk away
from being a Wolff sen,</i>

02:30.274 --> 02:34.877
<i>yet twenty years ago,
that's just what I did.</i>

02:34.879 --> 02:38.447
<i>And now I have to go home.</i>

02:46.623 --> 02:48.824
We about done here?
That storm's getting close.

02:48.826 --> 02:50.592
That's very funny, Michael,

02:50.594 --> 02:52.728
because from the amount of help
that you offered,

02:52.730 --> 02:54.630
I thought you wanted to get wet.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.199
I don't know the first thing
about fixin' stuff.

02:57.201 --> 02:58.901
Only breaking it.
I know.

02:58.903 --> 03:00.536
I told you this trip
was a shitty idea.

03:00.538 --> 03:02.437
Hey, I take no responsibility
for that.

03:02.439 --> 03:05.340
I don't know what happened.
And, Brandon, no one asked you.

03:05.342 --> 03:08.810
I cannot get in here and get
enough leverage on this wrench.

03:08.812 --> 03:12.247
Hey, bring your big man arms
over here.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.618
Didn't you just mention
I was good at breaking stuff?

03:16.620 --> 03:19.721
I know. Sometimes you're good
in a clinch.

03:19.723 --> 03:20.889
Come on.

03:20.891 --> 03:22.758
I just...

03:22.760 --> 03:25.694
I need you to just really
tighten that right there.

03:25.696 --> 03:28.797
- Okay, I got it.
- And we should be good.

03:30.466 --> 03:32.334
I don't know how that
even came off.

03:32.336 --> 03:34.303
The tension rod was still on.

03:34.305 --> 03:36.672
There.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.974
What are you lookin' at?
I did it right, right?

03:38.976 --> 03:44.713
Yeah, I think so.

03:44.715 --> 03:46.648
Can I have my ring back?

03:58.528 --> 04:00.829
That was romantic.

04:02.765 --> 04:04.533
I'm gonna piss.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.341
Whoo-hoo!

04:33.696 --> 04:35.330
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

04:39.970 --> 04:42.337
Uncle Michael?

04:50.847 --> 04:52.748
What?

04:52.750 --> 04:54.283
Don't be so nervous.

04:54.285 --> 04:56.285
I'm not nervous.
I just don't understand

04:56.287 --> 04:58.287
why this is
so important to you.

04:58.289 --> 04:59.688
It's your family, Michael.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.324
My family is not like yours.

05:02.326 --> 05:03.458
Doesn't matter.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.994
- Family's family.
- Right.

05:05.996 --> 05:07.996
'Cause you're the one who said,
"He's your nephew, Michael.

05:07.998 --> 05:09.331
You gotta take him in."

05:09.333 --> 05:10.799
Ohh...

05:12.001 --> 05:13.735
You were right.

05:13.737 --> 05:16.571
It's only one weekend.

05:16.573 --> 05:18.573
We can make it
through one weekend.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.795
- I'm trying to be supportive.
- "Go or I'm leaving."

05:39.797 --> 05:41.396
That's pretty much
what you said.

05:41.398 --> 05:43.832
And it seems like you're
real eager to make nice

05:43.834 --> 05:47.602
with the old fart that holds
the family purse strings.

05:53.876 --> 05:55.711
Jesus, Brandon,
what did you do?

05:55.713 --> 05:57.813
Nothin'.
I didn't do anything.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.382
- Let me look at that.
- Hey, don't... don't touch me.

06:00.384 --> 06:02.117
Brandon, let her
take a look at it.

06:02.119 --> 06:04.586
It was a tree branch,
all right?

06:04.588 --> 06:06.722
I said I'm fine.
I don't need you playing mom.

06:06.724 --> 06:08.590
Let's go.

06:11.561 --> 06:13.562
I just want you to know
that your little trust fund

06:13.564 --> 06:15.897
has nothing to do
with how I feel.

06:15.899 --> 06:17.733
It's the only reason
I stick around.

07:06.682 --> 07:09.684
Jesus, these potholes!

07:09.686 --> 07:11.820
The more you hit,
the more points you get.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.489
- So you're trying to hit them?
- Yep!

07:14.491 --> 07:17.125
I'm a good driver.

07:38.047 --> 07:41.216
Welcome to the Wolff sen
family compound.

07:41.218 --> 07:43.084
You grew up here?

07:43.086 --> 07:44.686
Yep.

08:05.074 --> 08:08.810
That's a little more
high-tech than I remember,

08:08.812 --> 08:11.646
but just as homey.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.184
It's beautiful grounds,

08:16.186 --> 08:19.488
but what's with
all the security?

08:19.490 --> 08:20.956
What's he so afraid of?

08:20.958 --> 08:23.892
Being alone.

08:27.230 --> 08:29.998
Oh, he's been busy.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.667
Wow.

08:56.092 --> 08:58.960
What the hell?

08:58.962 --> 09:00.629
Wow.

09:04.734 --> 09:06.268
God damn.

09:26.956 --> 09:29.224
Well, we're here.

09:31.994 --> 09:34.863
Get ready for
a fun-filled weekend.

09:39.201 --> 09:41.236
That must be Anabelle.

09:41.238 --> 09:44.639
How'd you get in here?
You need to leave!

09:44.641 --> 09:48.009
- Get off my property!
- Gary, I let them in.

09:48.011 --> 09:50.178
Calm down.

09:51.948 --> 09:53.949
Go say hello to your son, Gary.

09:55.618 --> 09:57.085
Junior?

09:57.087 --> 09:59.187
It's Michael.

10:03.125 --> 10:04.793
My boy.

10:04.795 --> 10:07.162
Is that you?

10:07.164 --> 10:10.765
Look at you.

10:16.639 --> 10:18.607
I'm sorry.

10:22.178 --> 10:23.745
For everything.

10:29.819 --> 10:33.355
But you're here now,
and we're all together.

10:33.357 --> 10:37.292
You and me and Chloe.

10:40.062 --> 10:42.864
That's Juliette, Dad,
my girlfriend.

10:42.866 --> 10:47.135
Your fiancee, actually.

10:47.137 --> 10:47.268
It's nice to meet you.

10:51.240 --> 10:55.377
Mint. They say if you
keep it in your pocket...

10:55.379 --> 10:57.078
It's just a superstition.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.713
But if you're gonna be
part of the family,

10:58.715 --> 11:00.815
we'll want to take care of you.

11:00.817 --> 11:02.283
Let's get her in.

11:02.285 --> 11:03.852
Wait.

11:03.854 --> 11:05.387
Brandon, come here.

11:05.389 --> 11:09.824
Dad, this is Brandon.

11:12.962 --> 11:15.130
You look just like her.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.266
Just like her.

11:18.268 --> 11:19.934
The eyes.

11:19.936 --> 11:23.271
It's uncanny.

11:23.273 --> 11:25.173
Maybe it's the eyeliner.

11:27.777 --> 11:29.811
What the hell
are you waiting for?

11:29.813 --> 11:31.279
Get their bags!

11:31.281 --> 11:33.148
It's my son.
He's home at last.

11:33.150 --> 11:37.052
No, I'll get them.
Brandon!

11:50.299 --> 11:53.068
- What's with all of this?
- All what?

11:53.070 --> 11:55.837
You don't like my decorations?

11:55.839 --> 11:57.105
We should have a toast.

12:10.019 --> 12:12.320
There's nothing there, Dad.

12:15.791 --> 12:19.961
Well, we all shouldn't just
stand around out here!

12:19.963 --> 12:22.330
You still like scotch right?

12:38.881 --> 12:41.483
Michael, I'm sure you know
where your room is.

12:50.459 --> 12:52.427
A welcome home present.

13:06.842 --> 13:08.143
These have good mojo.

13:09.779 --> 13:12.881
I am so glad you're home, son.

13:12.883 --> 13:15.517
Now you go to your room
and put your things away,

13:15.519 --> 13:17.552
and I'll tell you the good news.

13:17.554 --> 13:19.187
I have news!

13:46.882 --> 13:50.451
Ah. Good eye.

13:50.453 --> 13:51.986
My latest addition.

13:51.988 --> 13:53.555
What is it?

13:53.557 --> 13:55.423
An eyeball.

13:55.425 --> 13:56.925
A camera.

13:56.927 --> 13:58.927
Military issue.

13:58.929 --> 14:01.262
Military issue?

14:01.264 --> 14:03.131
What the hell do you think's
gonna happen

14:03.133 --> 14:05.967
in your living room,
for God's sake, Dad?

14:05.969 --> 14:10.071
It's a little bit of overkill,
don't you think?

14:13.442 --> 14:14.876
To homecomings.

15:02.358 --> 15:03.925
Def Leppard?

15:03.927 --> 15:05.627
That's hot.

15:17.239 --> 15:18.606
Hey.

15:18.608 --> 15:21.509
Do you wanna make out
on your tiny bed?

15:25.147 --> 15:28.082
You know, I changed my mind.
I think this is going to be fun.

15:32.221 --> 15:34.088
That's new.

15:46.302 --> 15:47.969
Nice.

15:52.207 --> 15:55.276
Well, at least the first thing
that he said was he's sorry.

15:55.278 --> 15:58.513
I know. Sorry.
He does not get off that easy.

15:58.515 --> 16:00.715
Not after what he did to us.

16:02.217 --> 16:04.085
Michael, what is this?

16:04.087 --> 16:07.689
That is my high school diploma.

16:07.691 --> 16:11.092
Chloe and I were home-schooled.
She made it for me.

16:11.094 --> 16:14.529
Why does it say your name is
<i>Garrison</i> Michael Wolff sen?

16:18.200 --> 16:20.401
Am I marrying a Gary?

16:20.403 --> 16:22.737
No, you are not.

16:25.207 --> 16:27.442
Don't forget to wear your PJs.

16:29.211 --> 16:32.347
I don't know if I got 'em all.

16:36.485 --> 16:37.752
<i>Michael, here.</i>

16:44.226 --> 16:46.094
<i>He's watching.</i>

16:46.096 --> 16:47.228
Good.

16:47.230 --> 16:49.397
I was coming to talk to you.

16:49.399 --> 16:52.667
The intercom has been
on the fritz lately.

16:52.669 --> 16:55.636
- Can I have a minute?
- Oh, of course.

16:55.638 --> 16:57.105
Brandon is...

16:57.107 --> 16:58.606
Brandon.

17:00.476 --> 17:02.710
I'm sorry.
Take your time.

17:05.446 --> 17:08.182
I'll be unpacked in a second.

17:08.184 --> 17:11.419
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.321
I'm in one guest room,
and the other...

17:17.425 --> 17:20.094
It's just a little weird,
that's all.

17:20.096 --> 17:23.598
It's kinda girly,
but I'm fine.

17:23.599 --> 17:26.334
Okay, if you're sure.

17:29.104 --> 17:31.339
You can come in if you want.

17:35.344 --> 17:38.312
I don't know how you lived
without iPods.

17:48.590 --> 17:50.658
It was her favorite.

17:52.227 --> 17:55.163
Chloe said
it reminded her of mom.

17:55.165 --> 17:57.265
Dad hated it.

18:04.606 --> 18:06.574
I saw you had a guitar
in your room.

18:06.576 --> 18:08.576
I didn't know
you knew how to play.

18:08.578 --> 18:10.511
Not well. Why?

18:12.514 --> 18:15.483
If you want to learn,
you should ask Gary.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.820
He's really good.
At least he used to be.

18:18.822 --> 18:22.623
I don't why you talk
so much shit about Gary.

18:22.625 --> 18:25.226
He's weird, but he's cool.

18:25.228 --> 18:28.429
You should try living with him.

18:31.366 --> 18:34.135
Anything to get me
out of your place.

18:34.137 --> 18:35.503
You should cover that.

18:53.188 --> 18:54.589
Wow.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.758
This is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.260
What is this?

18:59.262 --> 19:00.828
His panic room.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.831
I'd panic, too, with all this
crazy shit in my house.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.600
The passcode is your birthday.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.402
My birthday?

19:43.372 --> 19:45.339
I'm sure you remember.

19:45.341 --> 19:51.245
God knows by the time you left,
he'd already amassed a compound.

19:51.247 --> 19:53.281
But now, Michael,

19:53.283 --> 19:57.618
the doctor says he's stuck
in some kind of rut.

19:57.620 --> 19:59.587
Mentally.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.722
His memory comes and goes.

20:01.724 --> 20:05.793
But security is
a constant obsession.

20:05.795 --> 20:08.529
After Chloe's...

20:11.301 --> 20:13.401
After her murder,

20:13.403 --> 20:16.771
he started going
downhill fast, Michael.

20:16.773 --> 20:20.241
Progressive dementia.

20:20.243 --> 20:22.243
What's with all that stuff?

20:22.245 --> 20:24.812
Protection.

20:24.814 --> 20:27.682
Against what?
Good taste?

20:27.684 --> 20:32.587
Evil.
Spirits who mean harm.

20:32.589 --> 20:35.323
These symbols are meant
to keep them at bay.

20:42.331 --> 20:44.765
They don't like
their own reflection?

20:49.605 --> 20:51.539
So what else
does the doctor say?

20:52.941 --> 20:55.943
Have you talked to Gary
about what he ultimately wants?

20:55.945 --> 20:58.246
A home?

20:58.248 --> 21:00.681
Oh, he gets very upset.

21:04.019 --> 21:07.855
Sometimes he thinks...

21:07.857 --> 21:10.024
I'm your mother.

21:10.026 --> 21:11.425
Has he...

21:13.662 --> 21:15.329
I'm fine.

21:15.331 --> 21:18.966
But I do need to ask for help
with your father.

21:18.968 --> 21:21.269
I can't do it anymore, Michael.

21:25.607 --> 21:27.742
You'll stay on at the house,
right?

21:27.744 --> 21:30.411
I appreciate that,

21:30.413 --> 21:32.613
but no.

21:32.615 --> 21:34.515
This house...

21:34.517 --> 21:39.387
This house is too... full.

21:39.389 --> 21:40.988
It's yours.

21:40.990 --> 21:44.592
- I just want to go.
- That's why you called.

21:49.564 --> 21:51.832
Right.

21:51.834 --> 21:55.603
Well, I'll, uh...

21:55.605 --> 21:57.705
wrap my head around it,

21:57.707 --> 22:00.908
and we'll both talk to him
in the morning.

22:02.644 --> 22:03.711
I'm sorry.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.614
No, I...

22:06.616 --> 22:08.616
I get it.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.719
This is insanity.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.387
I know.

22:13.389 --> 22:15.856
Who's insane?

22:15.858 --> 22:19.760
Uh, this great
new room improvement.

22:19.762 --> 22:23.931
Command central used to be
a desk and a couple of monitors.

22:23.933 --> 22:27.868
Well, home protection has come
a long way in twenty years.

22:27.870 --> 22:32.406
And I am impressed.

22:37.412 --> 22:42.516
Yes, well, I have
microphones and cameras

22:42.518 --> 22:47.088
to cover the entire estate
and house.

22:47.090 --> 22:50.791
Motion detecting,
infrared, EMPs,

22:50.793 --> 22:54.595
night vision,
and ultra wide band radar.

22:55.964 --> 22:58.866
Nothing can hide
from these babies.

22:58.868 --> 23:02.136
You care to explain these?

23:02.138 --> 23:05.873
This is a
very special place, son.

23:05.875 --> 23:10.544
It requires
very special protection.

23:10.546 --> 23:12.546
Yeah.

23:12.548 --> 23:15.883
Maybe one day
you'll understand that.

23:16.985 --> 23:20.020
And now maybe my wife

23:20.022 --> 23:24.158
will stop trespassing
in my private zone,

23:24.160 --> 23:26.761
and you and I
can have that drink.

23:26.763 --> 23:29.096
And you can tell me that news.

23:32.167 --> 23:34.068
News?

23:36.973 --> 23:40.841
Oh! Better make sure all
the windows are closed tonight.

23:40.843 --> 23:45.112
I'm going to make some tea.
Anyone else?

23:45.114 --> 23:47.014
Here, let me show you a song.

23:47.016 --> 23:48.783
Since when do you play?

23:48.785 --> 23:51.852
Never practiced.
He was lazy.

24:10.138 --> 24:14.175
<i>d One by one d
d they left you there d</i>

24:14.177 --> 24:17.778
<i>d Sitting on d
d a breaking chair d</i>

24:17.780 --> 24:20.981
<i>d One by one d
d without a sound d</i>

24:20.983 --> 24:25.219
<i>d They left you falling d
d to the ground d</i>

24:27.956 --> 24:31.192
<i>d She felt you there d
d She took your hand d</i>

24:31.194 --> 24:35.663
<i>d And with her heart d
d she helped you stand d</i>

24:36.832 --> 24:38.532
Looks hard.

24:40.135 --> 24:42.603
The best ones are.

24:43.605 --> 24:45.473
Chloe likes that one.

24:45.475 --> 24:46.841
She did.

24:46.843 --> 24:48.909
Reminded her of Mom.

24:57.019 --> 24:57.885
Whoa.

25:01.189 --> 25:04.792
- There's something out there.
- Where?

25:04.794 --> 25:08.195
With all of Gary's security,
I seriously doubt that any...

25:14.202 --> 25:15.703
Garrison Michael Wolff sen!

25:15.705 --> 25:17.838
Did you break my cup?

25:17.840 --> 25:21.008
I found it in the cupboard
in pieces!

25:22.277 --> 25:24.545
You see?

25:24.547 --> 25:28.015
It's like he's just... gone.

25:31.620 --> 25:34.755
Music!
That's what we need!

25:38.995 --> 25:40.294
Would you like to dance?

25:41.563 --> 25:43.631
Oh, never mind, you old hag.

25:43.633 --> 25:47.234
I wanted to dance with
a young beautiful thing anyway!

25:47.236 --> 25:50.604
Oh, uh, no.
I am not much of a dancer.

25:50.606 --> 25:54.275
Well, come here
and let me teach you.

26:01.950 --> 26:05.152
Michael, you remember
our dance nights?

26:05.154 --> 26:07.955
Chloe loves to dance.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.558
She would twirl the night away.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.326
You twirled the night away.

26:15.230 --> 26:17.197
Well...

26:20.235 --> 26:24.805
if you hadn't been such
a party pooper since birth.

26:24.807 --> 26:29.310
He's always so sour.
I don't see what you see in him.

26:29.312 --> 26:33.013
I'll tell you
what I do remember.

26:33.015 --> 26:35.115
I remember you
beating the shit out of Chloe

26:35.117 --> 26:37.318
for spilling her milk
on the carpet.

26:42.324 --> 26:44.024
Gary?

26:45.760 --> 26:48.629
Perhaps we should
just go on to bed?

26:54.002 --> 26:58.772
Gary, perhaps it's time
to say good night.

27:02.611 --> 27:05.613
How many times
have I told you, Beverly?

27:05.615 --> 27:07.948
Do not question me
in front of the kids!

27:07.950 --> 27:09.950
- Enough, Gary!
- I am the man of the house!

27:09.952 --> 27:11.285
Enough!

27:11.287 --> 27:13.053
That's right!

27:13.055 --> 27:15.155
Enough!

27:15.157 --> 27:19.693
I'm calling my niece
first thing in the morning.

27:21.129 --> 27:22.329
Go to bed, Gary.

27:22.331 --> 27:23.797
But, Beverly...

27:23.799 --> 27:25.199
This isn't Beverly.

27:25.201 --> 27:27.267
This is your new wife Anabelle,

27:27.269 --> 27:29.203
and she's leaving
in the morning.

27:29.205 --> 27:32.406
Just like Mom
left you several years ago.

27:32.408 --> 27:36.310
And if you ever touch her again,

27:36.312 --> 27:39.013
I swear to God...

27:56.998 --> 27:59.800
Looks like we're staying
a little longer.

28:14.015 --> 28:15.749
Anabelle?

28:17.686 --> 28:21.121
- Yes, dear?
- I just wanted to say that...

28:21.123 --> 28:24.224
whatever it is you need,
we'll do.

28:24.226 --> 28:26.226
You're family.

28:26.228 --> 28:29.697
I'd be careful about using
that word in this house,

28:29.699 --> 28:31.732
if I were you.

28:36.038 --> 28:38.806
Well, regardless,
the sentiment remains the same.

28:38.808 --> 28:40.874
Of course.

28:40.876 --> 28:43.377
I know what you mean,

28:43.379 --> 28:45.813
and I appreciate it.

28:45.815 --> 28:47.414
Good night.

28:47.416 --> 28:49.783
Good night, dear.

29:05.334 --> 29:08.335
He'll kill you, he'll kill you,
<i>he'll kill you...</i>

29:17.846 --> 29:20.514
Hey, Gigantor, move over.

29:20.516 --> 29:23.150
Give me some room.

30:04.325 --> 30:07.127
That sound is really annoying.

30:09.931 --> 30:11.231
Yeah.

30:19.542 --> 30:23.076
Hush.
People are trying to sleep.

30:23.078 --> 30:26.313
Oh, thank God.

30:26.315 --> 30:28.882
I wonder if it's from the storm.

31:44.192 --> 31:46.260
You couldn't save her.

31:54.469 --> 31:55.936
Dad, no!

32:24.999 --> 32:27.367
Oh! Jeez!

32:27.369 --> 32:29.236
I thought I lost you.

32:29.238 --> 32:32.673
Well, you... you almost did.

32:39.013 --> 32:42.549
It's okay.
It's just a bad dream.

32:46.688 --> 32:50.590
I don't blame you either.
Tonight was totally crazy.

32:50.592 --> 32:53.160
Sorry. No pun intended.

33:00.101 --> 33:04.171
I'm really sorry
I've been pushy lately.

33:04.173 --> 33:08.642
- You haven't been pushy.
- No, I have.

33:08.644 --> 33:12.446
Asking you to set dates and
stuff when you're clearly not...

33:12.448 --> 33:15.382
I'm clearly what?

33:15.384 --> 33:19.987
Well, you just... You got
a lot of stuff going on.

33:19.989 --> 33:23.190
With Chloe and Brandon

33:23.192 --> 33:25.425
and William
and now your dad.

33:27.095 --> 33:29.162
I promise I'll back off.

33:29.164 --> 33:31.331
Don't back off.

33:34.068 --> 33:36.703
I don't want to lose you, too.

33:36.705 --> 33:39.439
Yeah?

33:39.441 --> 33:41.441
Then let's hope
that surly teenager

33:41.443 --> 33:43.543
doesn't send me
screaming from the house.

33:50.351 --> 33:54.087
You know I'm not with you
for the money, right?

33:54.089 --> 33:57.657
Yeah, I know.
I was just angry.

34:08.404 --> 34:11.103
What was that?

34:11.106 --> 34:12.572
Gary.

34:21.815 --> 34:23.650
Whoa.

34:23.652 --> 34:26.386
He was out there!
I saw him!

34:26.388 --> 34:28.487
He pushed me, and I fell!
Look!

34:28.489 --> 34:30.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, all right?

34:30.726 --> 34:34.360
There was no one out there.
You just tripped and fell, okay?

34:34.362 --> 34:36.530
Jesus, Dad, give me that!

34:36.532 --> 34:38.264
You could seriously
hurt someone!

34:38.266 --> 34:40.266
What does he want?

34:40.268 --> 34:42.735
He's always so much
worse when he's tired.

34:42.737 --> 34:44.471
You gotta believe me!

34:44.473 --> 34:47.774
You can't go around shooting off
firearms at nothing!

34:47.775 --> 34:50.377
The cameras, they...
I went out to investigate!

34:50.379 --> 34:52.612
He was out there!
I saw him!

34:52.614 --> 34:55.482
Gary, let Anabelle get you
some clean pajamas, okay?

34:55.484 --> 34:57.417
I will go see.

34:57.419 --> 34:59.286
Michael...

34:59.288 --> 35:00.620
Yeah.

35:04.225 --> 35:06.860
You're not wearing
your necklace.

35:12.166 --> 35:14.835
And mine's all broken.

35:21.409 --> 35:23.677
Is this new? It looks old.

35:23.679 --> 35:25.712
What? I don't know.

35:25.714 --> 35:28.148
I've never seen it.

35:28.150 --> 35:30.484
What the hell happened?

35:30.486 --> 35:33.820
Dad, it's bedtime, okay?

35:33.822 --> 35:35.522
It's bedtime.

35:37.425 --> 35:40.694
You always liked story time.

35:47.201 --> 35:50.170
We had some good times,
didn't we?

35:52.640 --> 35:53.840
Yes.

36:59.941 --> 37:01.741
What the...

37:17.325 --> 37:18.758
What the...

37:22.230 --> 37:24.397
Ah! Shit!

37:28.836 --> 37:31.404
Dude, what are you doing?

37:31.406 --> 37:33.506
What are <i>you</i> doing?

37:33.508 --> 37:35.642
You're bleeding.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.510
- Ohh...
- What did you do?

37:37.512 --> 37:39.279
Glass cut my foot.

37:42.250 --> 37:46.620
Shit. You want me to see
if there's any piece in there?

37:48.623 --> 37:49.689
Yeah.

37:52.727 --> 37:55.629
No, you're right, you're right.
That's a bad idea.

37:55.631 --> 37:58.698
I don't really like feet.

38:17.852 --> 38:19.986
Okay if I sleep out here?

38:19.988 --> 38:21.988
Room getting to you?

38:21.990 --> 38:24.457
The room and the cameras.

38:24.459 --> 38:26.693
The crazy guy in the halls.

38:31.432 --> 38:33.633
Pick that up, will you?

38:34.602 --> 38:37.871
What is this?

38:37.873 --> 38:40.340
Antique family records.

38:43.511 --> 38:45.478
What language is this?

38:45.480 --> 38:47.614
That is Old Norse.

38:47.616 --> 38:48.815
No shit.

38:48.817 --> 38:51.618
No shit.
You come from Vikings.

38:53.020 --> 38:56.423
Gary was busy with that shit
my whole childhood.

38:56.425 --> 38:59.659
Sat up at night
reading and translating.

38:59.661 --> 39:04.097
That's where he came up
with this brilliant idea.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.035
I thought you were
gonna hit him.

39:10.671 --> 39:12.672
I'm glad you didn't.

39:12.674 --> 39:16.042
I waited my whole life
for that moment.

39:16.044 --> 39:18.111
Planned it out.

39:20.081 --> 39:23.650
Maybe I should have hit him
for Mom.

39:23.652 --> 39:27.087
It's different
when it's an old guy.

39:27.089 --> 39:28.922
Yeah, apparently.

39:30.391 --> 39:32.525
Did he hit your mom, too?

39:32.527 --> 39:34.561
Oh, yeah. Often.

39:35.963 --> 39:39.799
Then he made me watch her die.

39:39.801 --> 39:43.036
No, not like that.

39:43.038 --> 39:46.806
He wouldn't let me see her
for years after she left.

39:48.609 --> 39:51.845
When I was 15,
and I had a choice,

39:51.847 --> 39:55.749
I went to live with Mom.

39:55.751 --> 39:58.952
Soon after that,
she got her cancer diagnosis.

39:58.954 --> 40:03.723
She didn't have a penny
for treatment or meds.

40:03.725 --> 40:06.893
And here he sat,

40:06.895 --> 40:10.964
holed up with millions of
dollars of family fortune.

40:13.067 --> 40:15.668
Not like he was
spending it, right?

40:29.150 --> 40:31.651
After she left,
that's when he did that?

40:33.454 --> 40:34.854
Yeah.

40:37.691 --> 40:39.993
Mom said it was
to keep you guys together.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.196
Oh, yeah, and it did,

40:43.198 --> 40:46.966
right up until
I had a choice.

40:46.968 --> 40:49.769
A little over
two years after that,

40:49.771 --> 40:51.805
Mom was dead...

40:51.807 --> 40:54.073
right before my 18th birthday.

41:03.451 --> 41:04.851
That's your mom.

41:09.089 --> 41:12.125
It eats away at me sometimes.

41:14.762 --> 41:17.697
Chloe did love Dad.

41:19.700 --> 41:23.870
Somehow she was always
able to forgive him.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.172
Give him a second chance.

41:29.844 --> 41:33.713
How could she end up with
another guy that beats her?

41:35.082 --> 41:36.783
She was so stupid.

41:36.785 --> 41:39.519
She wasn't stupid, Brandon.

41:39.521 --> 41:41.721
She was duped.

41:43.557 --> 41:47.026
Sometimes you just
go with what you know.

41:48.929 --> 41:51.231
Get some rest, kiddo.

42:06.881 --> 42:09.148
Gary?

42:09.150 --> 42:11.684
Gary, where are you?

42:57.898 --> 43:00.199
- Hey.
- Hmm.

43:00.201 --> 43:02.669
Hey, it's almost noon.

43:02.671 --> 43:05.705
You've been out here all night?

43:05.707 --> 43:08.141
Yeah.

43:08.143 --> 43:09.943
I have to admit that double bed

43:09.945 --> 43:13.613
does sleep a lot better
without you.

43:13.615 --> 43:16.649
Your dad's snoring
finally woke me up, though.

43:16.651 --> 43:19.719
I bet.

43:19.721 --> 43:21.988
I have a feeling
he's gonna be out for a while

43:21.990 --> 43:23.289
if we just let him sleep.

43:23.291 --> 43:25.959
Did you make some coffee?

43:25.961 --> 43:27.961
I don't know
where the coffee pot is.

43:27.963 --> 43:31.364
- It's in the kitchen.
- Anabelle's in there.

43:31.366 --> 43:32.732
Come on.

43:48.082 --> 43:50.850
Is today still the day?

43:50.852 --> 43:53.686
Michael...

43:56.090 --> 43:58.157
Please don't think
I don't love him.

43:58.159 --> 44:01.995
I wish my mom would've left
years earlier.

44:01.997 --> 44:03.763
You go.

44:08.302 --> 44:09.836
We got this.

44:18.779 --> 44:20.780
I'm gonna have
the first waffle.

44:20.782 --> 44:22.849
Oh, you're such a jerk.

44:24.251 --> 44:26.886
- You want it?
- Mm-hmm.

44:43.738 --> 44:45.104
Pinky, Brandon.

44:45.106 --> 44:47.040
Pinky.

44:51.211 --> 44:53.046
Morning, Junior.

44:53.048 --> 44:56.249
Don't call me that.
And it's after noon.

45:01.422 --> 45:02.855
Juliette.

45:02.857 --> 45:05.224
My dance partner.

45:05.226 --> 45:07.427
How could I forget?

45:20.074 --> 45:22.975
Why are we all
sitting in the dark?

45:26.180 --> 45:28.114
Shit.

45:58.812 --> 46:02.749
Hey, can I go check out
that tree house out front?

46:02.751 --> 46:04.884
I just want to see
where you and Mom hung out.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.920
Fine, but be careful.

46:16.363 --> 46:20.032
I think I saw a ladder
in the garage.

46:23.203 --> 46:25.271
Put on a jacket.

46:29.943 --> 46:31.410
Give me that.

46:34.348 --> 46:35.915
There you are.

46:35.917 --> 46:37.984
I was just looking for you.
Do you mind?

46:37.986 --> 46:39.819
No, go ahead.

46:41.388 --> 46:44.223
I, uh...

46:44.225 --> 46:46.192
I put some things
in your luggage.

46:46.194 --> 46:49.462
I don't want Gary to find them.

46:49.464 --> 46:51.364
Like what?

46:51.366 --> 46:53.032
- Keys.
- Oh.

46:53.034 --> 46:56.002
Some instructions,

46:56.004 --> 46:57.904
passcodes,

46:57.906 --> 47:00.006
bank information,

47:00.008 --> 47:01.440
stuff like that.

47:01.442 --> 47:03.476
Okay.

47:03.478 --> 47:06.312
Do you mind?

47:06.314 --> 47:08.815
Not at all.
Of course.

47:08.817 --> 47:11.250
Partners in crime here.

47:36.176 --> 47:38.211
Annabelle, tell me something.

47:38.213 --> 47:41.047
What?

47:41.049 --> 47:43.416
The way Gary treats you...

47:45.586 --> 47:47.954
Why did you stay so long?

47:47.956 --> 47:51.190
You know, I ask myself
the same question.

47:52.459 --> 47:55.161
But, honey,

47:55.163 --> 47:57.530
love is enduring.

47:57.532 --> 48:00.366
I do love Gary.

48:00.368 --> 48:04.437
And I can see you love Michael
very much.

48:06.039 --> 48:08.975
- Yeah, I do.
- And he loves you.

48:24.358 --> 48:26.626
What?

48:26.628 --> 48:30.630
How much did Gary tell you
about Chloe and William?

48:30.632 --> 48:34.233
He told me what he knew.

48:34.235 --> 48:37.470
Chloe and William,
they were married for a while,

48:37.472 --> 48:42.308
and he was... very abusive,

48:42.310 --> 48:46.913
and everybody knew it,
but everybody kept quiet.

48:46.915 --> 48:48.648
<i>You're so weak!</i>

48:48.650 --> 48:51.951
<i>Do you understand?
You hurt my son!</i>

48:51.953 --> 48:57.323
One day he just
lost it on Brandon, and...

48:57.325 --> 48:59.425
he broke his arm.

48:59.427 --> 49:00.660
Badly.

49:00.662 --> 49:04.297
There was a bone poking through.

49:05.933 --> 49:07.934
And finally Michael,
you know, he had enough,

49:07.936 --> 49:12.204
and he just said,
"You have to leave him."

49:12.206 --> 49:15.174
So she did, and she came
to live with us,

49:15.176 --> 49:19.712
but, uh...
a couple days later,

49:19.714 --> 49:23.249
William broke into our house...

49:23.251 --> 49:25.184
and stabbed her.

51:20.333 --> 51:21.801
My God.

51:24.137 --> 51:26.572
We never knew
that part of the story.

51:26.574 --> 51:30.076
- Yeah, I didn't think so.
- I can't even imagine.

51:30.078 --> 51:33.212
And then there's Brandon.
He hates me.

51:57.137 --> 51:59.238
<i>Brandon.</i>

52:07.347 --> 52:08.714
Brandon!

52:14.554 --> 52:16.856
Come on, Dad, help me!

52:19.559 --> 52:21.494
Come on, let's go.

52:24.464 --> 52:26.565
- Oh, my word!
- Brandon, what happened?

52:26.567 --> 52:28.467
- Oh, my God.
- Don't let go of me!

52:35.142 --> 52:36.909
Ow! Stop it, okay?

52:36.911 --> 52:38.711
They're just scratches!
I'm fine!

52:38.713 --> 52:41.914
That's been happening to you
an awful lot lately.

52:41.916 --> 52:43.649
What did you do?

52:43.651 --> 52:45.851
He didn't.
He didn't do anything.

52:47.821 --> 52:50.189
What does this look like to you?

52:50.924 --> 52:52.858
No. No, Michael!

52:52.860 --> 52:54.693
Don't touch him.

52:54.695 --> 52:56.228
Not him.

52:56.230 --> 52:57.730
Not ever.

52:57.732 --> 52:59.398
Watch him!

53:01.301 --> 53:03.569
But it wasn't me.

53:54.521 --> 53:57.489
There's been an accident.
I wonder...

53:59.326 --> 54:01.694
Actually, I was wondering about
the security footage.

54:01.696 --> 54:03.762
Do you guys keep...

54:03.764 --> 54:06.599
Hello?

54:06.601 --> 54:07.933
Hello?

54:26.886 --> 54:29.755
<i>Stay.</i>

54:31.891 --> 54:34.326
Stop it!
Just stop it!

54:46.973 --> 54:48.841
Thank you.

54:55.649 --> 54:57.716
Come on.
Come on, come on.

55:09.029 --> 55:11.363
I'm sorry, Gary.

55:13.800 --> 55:18.804
But there...
there are some things...

55:18.806 --> 55:21.440
I just can't accept,

55:21.442 --> 55:24.510
that I just can't live with.

55:31.785 --> 55:33.719
There you go.

55:34.688 --> 55:37.990
You stay safe, my darling.

55:39.459 --> 55:40.926
Safe.

55:46.032 --> 55:48.367
He isn't telling you
everything,

55:48.369 --> 55:52.971
and when he does,
it will sound crazy.

55:52.973 --> 55:57.910
I may have gone a little crazy
myself to believe it.

55:57.912 --> 56:00.846
You need to tell them
everything.

56:00.848 --> 56:03.782
You need to tell them.
They have a right to know.

56:03.784 --> 56:06.652
It isn't safe
to keep it from them.

56:08.088 --> 56:11.090
Whatever you decide, my dear,

56:11.092 --> 56:14.393
decide it with all your heart.

56:15.595 --> 56:16.662
Anabelle...

56:19.032 --> 56:20.432
Michael!

56:23.136 --> 56:25.437
<i>Brandon, I'm so sorry.</i>

56:35.115 --> 56:36.682
Shit.

56:55.535 --> 56:57.069
What are you doing?

56:57.071 --> 57:00.172
Oh, my God.
What is this place?

57:00.174 --> 57:02.474
I thought there might be
a manual switch

57:02.476 --> 57:05.511
or some way I could restart
the server in here.

57:05.513 --> 57:07.513
I don't know
how he's doing this.

57:07.515 --> 57:09.515
- Anabelle is leaving.
- Right now?

57:09.517 --> 57:12.184
Yeah, and she was talking about
something Gary is not telling us

57:12.186 --> 57:14.753
that sounds very important.

57:14.755 --> 57:16.655
So you need to come.

57:16.657 --> 57:17.956
Is her niece here?

57:17.958 --> 57:20.826
I don't know.
I came to find you.

57:22.862 --> 57:25.464
- Shit.
- I know, right?

57:26.599 --> 57:27.766
Where's Gary?

57:27.768 --> 57:29.535
I don't know.
I lost him.

57:29.537 --> 57:32.905
He was there one moment
and then he was gone.

57:32.907 --> 57:35.507
I might have a concussion.
I'm seeing things.

57:35.509 --> 57:38.510
- Well, is Anabelle gone?
- I don't know.

57:38.512 --> 57:40.679
What do you mean,
you might have a concussion?

57:58.232 --> 58:00.499
Michael?

58:58.024 --> 58:59.758
I'll get it,

59:03.630 --> 59:04.696
Hi.

59:04.698 --> 59:07.232
Hey, um,
is Aunt Anabelle ready?

59:07.234 --> 59:09.301
Yeah.

59:09.303 --> 59:10.669
Um...

59:13.172 --> 59:14.573
I'm Brandon.

59:14.575 --> 59:16.742
Christine.

59:16.744 --> 59:18.110
Nice to meet you.

59:20.246 --> 59:23.181
So what happened here
last night?

59:28.154 --> 59:30.722
We should go inside.

59:30.724 --> 59:31.924
Okay.

59:42.869 --> 59:45.337
What grade are you in?

59:47.007 --> 59:49.775
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.

59:49.777 --> 59:52.244
Is Anabelle ready?
I saw her bags outside.

59:52.246 --> 59:54.646
- Are you Christine?
- Yeah.

59:54.648 --> 59:57.649
We thought that she was
already with you.

59:57.651 --> 01:00:01.620
With? But I...
I just... I just got here.

01:00:03.356 --> 01:00:06.692
Did you guys see this?

01:00:06.694 --> 01:00:08.026
Seen what?

01:00:14.233 --> 01:00:17.302
It looks like you guys
got TP'd or something.

01:00:17.304 --> 01:00:18.870
I hate to tell you this,

01:00:18.872 --> 01:00:22.040
but they let the air
out of your tires, too.

01:00:22.042 --> 01:00:24.109
Oh, my God.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.982
I changed my mind.
Let's find Anabelle

01:00:29.984 --> 01:00:31.617
and go in Christine's car.

01:00:31.619 --> 01:00:33.385
I'll come back
with the authorities for Dad

01:00:33.387 --> 01:00:35.354
once I get you guys into town.

01:00:35.356 --> 01:00:38.890
My car? What's going on?
I really gotta get going.

01:00:38.892 --> 01:00:41.226
Look, right now we just really
need to find your aunt.

01:00:41.228 --> 01:00:46.198
Michael, where do you think
she could have even gone?

01:00:47.834 --> 01:00:50.802
- What is it?
- Go inside.

01:00:50.804 --> 01:00:53.171
Michael, what is it?

01:00:56.342 --> 01:00:57.876
What happened?

01:00:59.879 --> 01:01:01.747
Is it my aunt?

01:01:01.749 --> 01:01:03.181
Is she all right?

01:01:03.183 --> 01:01:04.716
No.

01:01:06.986 --> 01:01:08.887
No, no, no.
You don't wanna know.

01:01:08.889 --> 01:01:10.756
Oh, God.

01:01:37.117 --> 01:01:38.383
Oh, no!

01:01:38.385 --> 01:01:39.885
Help! Help!

01:01:39.887 --> 01:01:41.887
Get out of the way.

01:01:41.889 --> 01:01:43.922
No, no.

01:01:43.924 --> 01:01:47.459
Brandon, come on!
She's dead! Let's go!

01:01:49.362 --> 01:01:51.830
Michael, help him!
Brandon!

01:02:07.413 --> 01:02:08.480
Boo.

01:02:22.095 --> 01:02:24.062
Not so perfect now, are you?

01:03:08.107 --> 01:03:11.810
This is just like when he went
ape shit on us at home.

01:03:11.812 --> 01:03:14.079
It's a game with him.
He's gonna draw us out.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:16.448
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:19.084
He's fuckin' playing with us.

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:22.254
I don't get it.
How is he here?

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:25.123
It was him at the tree house.

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:29.494
I think I saw him
when the car broke down.

01:03:29.496 --> 01:03:31.997
I saw Mom, too.

01:03:31.999 --> 01:03:33.365
Where?

01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:41.039
Is he gone?

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.307
No.

01:03:53.252 --> 01:03:56.021
<i>Never again.</i>

01:03:58.591 --> 01:04:00.859
- There you are.
- Get out!

01:04:14.907 --> 01:04:17.175
Who the hell
is on my property?

01:04:17.177 --> 01:04:19.911
William.
Chloe's husband.

01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:21.513
My dad.

01:04:21.515 --> 01:04:24.349
But how did he
get through my wards?

01:04:24.351 --> 01:04:27.319
That stuff isn't real, Dad.

01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:30.322
Neither are ghosts,
I guess you'd say.

01:04:32.024 --> 01:04:37.062
I seem to recall my precautions
saving your ass out there.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.168
- Hey.
- Juliette.

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.269
Hey.

01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.604
Hey.

01:04:45.606 --> 01:04:48.306
I can barely move my arm,

01:04:48.308 --> 01:04:50.208
and my head is...

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:52.043
You just hit your head,
that's all.

01:04:52.045 --> 01:04:54.212
Let's get to the panic room.

01:04:54.214 --> 01:04:56.348
Come on, honey, let's go.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:59.284
You're saying Chloe's been
trapped here this whole time.

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.419
You called me insane.

01:05:01.421 --> 01:05:04.656
The next words out of my mouth
were not going to be,

01:05:04.658 --> 01:05:09.027
"Your dear departed sister
is living with me."

01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:17.569
And while I'm truly sorry,
I'm glad, too,

01:05:17.571 --> 01:05:20.272
because...

01:05:20.274 --> 01:05:24.242
I'm losing my mind,
you see?

01:05:24.244 --> 01:05:27.212
It's going.

01:05:27.214 --> 01:05:30.081
Faster than I'd like to admit.

01:05:30.083 --> 01:05:33.551
Pieces at a time.

01:05:33.553 --> 01:05:37.222
But now I know
that after I die...

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:40.425
no, after <i>we</i> die...

01:05:40.427 --> 01:05:45.030
we'll all come back together.

01:05:45.032 --> 01:05:46.498
Here!

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.366
That's impossible.

01:05:48.368 --> 01:05:51.002
Michael, please tell me that
you are not believing this.

01:05:51.004 --> 01:05:56.141
I didn't take it completely
seriously all those years ago.

01:05:56.143 --> 01:05:59.344
Truth be known,
I was just an angry drunk

01:05:59.346 --> 01:06:03.114
with too much time on my hands.

01:06:03.116 --> 01:06:08.720
But our family
has a very unique lore.

01:06:08.722 --> 01:06:12.991
I pulled this from the book
<i>The Pack Eternal.</i>

01:06:12.993 --> 01:06:15.226
You used to say that
all the time.

01:06:15.228 --> 01:06:19.030
It's part of an ancient ritual.

01:06:19.032 --> 01:06:24.002
Once done, we shall be
gathered unto one place,

01:06:24.004 --> 01:06:26.338
never to be cast asunder.

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.074
United in death as in life,

01:06:29.076 --> 01:06:32.711
and by hallowed ground
of the ritual.

01:06:32.713 --> 01:06:36.748
I've been working
on the "hallowed ground" part.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:41.119
All this shit, as you call it,

01:06:41.121 --> 01:06:46.224
is meant to make this place
safe for us.

01:06:46.226 --> 01:06:48.326
Not now.

01:06:48.328 --> 01:06:50.061
Later.

01:06:50.063 --> 01:06:54.632
I have a trust that's been set.

01:06:54.634 --> 01:06:59.337
It will maintain this compound
until the end of time.

01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:02.173
And when I cross over,

01:07:02.175 --> 01:07:06.411
it will be me and Chloe,

01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:11.316
and then one day
you will join us.

01:07:15.388 --> 01:07:18.690
I've seen them.
Both of them.

01:07:20.259 --> 01:07:21.659
Me, too.

01:07:23.562 --> 01:07:25.196
You cursed us.

01:07:27.566 --> 01:07:29.267
The scar?

01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:32.704
It binds us to the place
of the ritual at death.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.810
Mom is here stuck...
and Dad is out there.

01:07:38.812 --> 01:07:41.613
That's the mystery.

01:07:43.617 --> 01:07:45.283
We got him.

01:07:45.285 --> 01:07:47.485
It's a thermal reading.

01:07:47.487 --> 01:07:50.422
He's got a heat signature.

01:08:02.768 --> 01:08:06.171
He's working on my last level
of exterior protection.

01:08:06.173 --> 01:08:07.672
What happens then?

01:08:07.674 --> 01:08:09.774
This is all we've got,

01:08:09.776 --> 01:08:12.110
and I don't know how long
it'll last.

01:08:12.112 --> 01:08:14.479
We've gotta go
on the offensive.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:17.448
We can't kill
what's been killed.

01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:19.716
We must banish him.

01:08:19.719 --> 01:08:22.554
I can't do this, Dad.

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:25.523
I can't watch anyone else die.

01:08:25.524 --> 01:08:28.225
Well, at least Anabelle's away
and safe.

01:08:33.165 --> 01:08:34.666
Where's Brandon?

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:37.469
Brandon!

01:08:39.705 --> 01:08:42.207
Oh, Jesus, Brandon, stop!

01:08:42.209 --> 01:08:45.109
Get it off of me!
Just get it off of me!

01:08:45.112 --> 01:08:47.679
Who did this to you?

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.880
My mom!

01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:50.881
Who else did she mark, Brandon?

01:08:50.884 --> 01:08:54.185
Dad! She marked my dad.

01:08:54.187 --> 01:08:56.187
So what happens
whenever he kills us

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:57.589
or what happens when we die,

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.125
are we gonna be stuck here
with him forever?

01:09:00.127 --> 01:09:03.294
Dad, when did you first start
noticing activity outside?

01:09:03.296 --> 01:09:04.796
When you got here.

01:09:04.798 --> 01:09:06.264
Didn't you say that
the people who were marked

01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:07.599
would be drawn together?

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.501
Yes, drawn to where
the ritual was performed

01:09:09.502 --> 01:09:12.136
and to the other members
of the bond!

01:09:12.139 --> 01:09:13.604
My mom did this at home.

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:16.407
She did this when I was little
at the apartment.

01:09:16.408 --> 01:09:18.309
Hers was performed here.

01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:21.179
Brandon was living with us
while Chloe was here.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.515
William was pulled
in every different direction.

01:09:23.517 --> 01:09:25.149
He couldn't fully manifest.

01:09:25.152 --> 01:09:27.285
Yeah, but now you guys
are all in one place.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:29.654
The balance has shifted.
He's getting stronger.

01:09:29.656 --> 01:09:32.490
He followed us.

01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:33.725
Is it reversible?

01:09:33.727 --> 01:09:35.560
The book talks of a way, but...

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:37.362
The book.

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:51.876
Oh, stay here.

01:09:57.483 --> 01:10:00.218
Shit. We got cut off
when I called.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.654
They have to send someone.

01:10:09.662 --> 01:10:11.796
How you doin' today?

01:10:11.798 --> 01:10:13.798
Yeah, we got a call
from dispatch.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.567
They said there was
a disturbance here.

01:10:15.569 --> 01:10:17.368
- Is everything all right?
- Uh...

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.871
We're having some trouble
with the equipment inside.

01:10:19.873 --> 01:10:22.674
Do you guys want to come in
and take a look at it?

01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:27.545
What is...

01:10:27.547 --> 01:10:29.581
Is that blood?

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:30.848
There's hair.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:33.618
Sir, stay right there.
Is that blood?

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.320
What is that?

01:10:35.322 --> 01:10:38.790
Just stay where you are, sir.
Just don't move.

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:41.693
Jack! Jack, call it in!

01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:42.727
Is that a body?

01:10:42.729 --> 01:10:44.629
What's over there?

01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:46.798
Jack, call it in!
Call it in!

01:10:48.267 --> 01:10:50.268
Don't move!
Don't you move.

01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:53.371
- Jack, call it in.
- What happened?

01:10:53.373 --> 01:10:55.373
Get over there!

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:57.575
Take it easy.

01:10:57.577 --> 01:11:00.378
What happened?

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.247
A lot of weird shit.
It is hard to explain.

01:11:02.249 --> 01:11:03.581
You will never believe it, okay?

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:06.351
The... The door.

01:11:07.786 --> 01:11:11.022
Hey. Hey, he's right behind you.

01:11:11.024 --> 01:11:12.423
He's right there!

01:11:14.727 --> 01:11:16.995
- Just come in, please.
- He's right there!

01:11:16.997 --> 01:11:18.997
He's right there.
He's right behind you.

01:11:27.873 --> 01:11:29.641
Oh, my God.

01:11:29.643 --> 01:11:30.642
Don't! Don't you move!

01:11:30.644 --> 01:11:31.643
Michael, come inside!

01:11:31.645 --> 01:11:33.778
Get back in here!

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.713
- Calm down.
- What the hell's going on here?

01:11:35.715 --> 01:11:37.515
What is going on here?

01:11:52.564 --> 01:11:56.034
Get up, Michael!
Come on, get up!

01:11:56.036 --> 01:11:58.569
- Get in the house!
- Michael, come on!

01:12:36.108 --> 01:12:38.376
Throw me the book!

01:12:47.586 --> 01:12:48.853
Hey, kiddo.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.881
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:23.020
Did I get him?

01:13:23.022 --> 01:13:25.556
Yeah, you got him.

01:13:25.558 --> 01:13:27.825
So why can't I see him?

01:13:27.827 --> 01:13:30.061
You don't have the mark.

01:13:30.063 --> 01:13:32.964
The only way you would see him
is in these monitors.

01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:34.866
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:38.136
This translation's missing,
the one about the scars.

01:13:38.138 --> 01:13:40.638
Dad, where are these pages?

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.442
I don't...

01:13:47.646 --> 01:13:49.714
Hey, don't go foggy on me now.

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:52.150
This is
the most important thing.

01:13:52.152 --> 01:13:55.119
I didn't lose them.
Somebody took them.

01:13:56.522 --> 01:13:58.856
I've seen those before.

01:13:58.858 --> 01:14:01.726
These?

01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:03.694
Where?

01:14:30.022 --> 01:14:32.089
It's Mom.

01:14:32.091 --> 01:14:35.493
It's a ritual.
We need to make a circle.

01:14:35.495 --> 01:14:37.728
That circle's on
the floor of the panic room.

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:40.598
That's too close quarters
for this.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.799
Help me.

01:14:55.247 --> 01:14:59.684
Okay, but that's in here,
and he's out there.

01:14:59.686 --> 01:15:01.486
Not for long.

01:15:13.899 --> 01:15:18.503
If this doesn't work,
this room is your last holdout.

01:15:18.505 --> 01:15:20.538
No, Michael, wait.
I don't like this idea.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.608
I don't want to separate.
I should be with you.

01:15:29.548 --> 01:15:32.016
Your only eyes and ears
are in here.

01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:35.853
And besides,
you don't have the scar.

01:15:35.855 --> 01:15:40.057
If all hell breaks loose,
maybe he'll leave you alone

01:15:40.059 --> 01:15:42.126
'cause you're not
part of the family.

01:15:42.128 --> 01:15:43.728
Hey.

01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:47.298
It may be the only thing
that saves you.

01:15:52.671 --> 01:15:55.540
Brandon, you ready?

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:58.075
Not really, but I'm in.

01:15:58.077 --> 01:16:01.879
Juliette, you holler
when you see him break through.

01:16:16.762 --> 01:16:18.129
Come on, kiddo.

01:16:35.347 --> 01:16:37.615
It's really quiet.

01:16:50.028 --> 01:16:51.996
Where the hell is he?

01:16:54.199 --> 01:16:56.200
Wait, was that him?

01:16:56.202 --> 01:16:57.602
I don't know.

01:17:04.376 --> 01:17:05.643
Shit.

01:17:27.265 --> 01:17:28.799
Get ready.

01:18:16.014 --> 01:18:18.783
You can't go out there blind.

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:20.151
Then don't let me.

01:19:15.907 --> 01:19:17.374
Michael!

01:21:00.846 --> 01:21:03.380
Where the hell did he go?

01:21:15.493 --> 01:21:16.894
Where is he?

01:21:16.896 --> 01:21:18.329
Behind you!

01:22:00.138 --> 01:22:01.906
Michael, here!

01:23:32.664 --> 01:23:37.401
Now and forever
I banish you from this bond!

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:43.540
Alone you shall wander,
bound by this curse.

01:23:43.542 --> 01:23:49.713
Broken from the circle,
I shall see you nevermore.

01:24:43.134 --> 01:24:44.735
Michael.

01:24:48.773 --> 01:24:50.474
You did good.

01:24:52.777 --> 01:24:55.546
You put your family first.

01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:58.849
That's all I ever asked.

01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:01.285
All I ever wanted to do.

01:25:04.122 --> 01:25:06.356
I'm proud of you.

01:26:44.656 --> 01:26:47.691
<i>d She can stop now d</i>

01:26:49.827 --> 01:26:51.495

01:26:55.934 --> 01:27:01.638
