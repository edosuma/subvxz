WEBVTT

00:09.812 --> 00:11.211
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

00:11.236 --> 00:12.835
Have you ever been up to the Institute?

00:12.860 --> 00:15.062
- Nope.
- Some people find it weird.

00:15.095 --> 00:16.561
Well, it obviously worked for you.

00:16.630 --> 00:17.870
I wouldn't be here without it.

00:17.895 --> 00:19.821
So it's true? I'm being replaced.

00:19.846 --> 00:21.266
I got a call from Amelia's rep.

00:21.311 --> 00:22.573
He's Institute, so...

00:22.598 --> 00:24.153
- we know how that works.
- Megan.

00:24.178 --> 00:25.830
Have you looked at the
language in this contract?

00:25.855 --> 00:28.039
He's expecting you to be
the perfect girlfriend.

00:28.108 --> 00:30.976
And I'm sorry, but we both
know you haven't been perfect.

00:31.044 --> 00:33.980
I'm not on the list,
but I love your play.

00:34.005 --> 00:36.292
Every actor who walks in here
tells me they love my play.

00:36.317 --> 00:37.875
And have you found your Kate yet?

00:37.900 --> 00:40.500
We'll read your script, but you're
just going to need to be patient.

00:40.525 --> 00:42.012
I found someone for us.

00:42.037 --> 00:43.750
DeAnn, this is Annika.

00:44.739 --> 00:47.540
I'm not so good at being patient.

00:47.609 --> 00:49.174
You make things look one way,

00:49.199 --> 00:50.991
and then Terence snaps his fingers,

00:51.016 --> 00:52.722
and you become a different person.

00:52.747 --> 00:54.848
I wasn't worth knowing
when I met Terence.

00:54.916 --> 00:57.867
And everything I have that's good
in my life... including you...

00:57.892 --> 01:00.827
I have because of Terence.
It's just gonna take time.

01:03.806 --> 01:05.340
People always ask me if it was really me

01:05.404 --> 01:07.538
jumping off that
suspension bridge in "AWOL."

01:07.606 --> 01:10.074
The answer is yes. I was the only one

01:10.142 --> 01:14.417
to jump off that very, very tall bridge.

01:14.819 --> 01:18.409
I was also the only one who
couldn't stop shaking beforehand.

01:18.434 --> 01:20.528
Now, why do you think I was shaking?

01:20.553 --> 01:22.353
Because you were scared.

01:22.378 --> 01:23.744
I was cold.

01:25.180 --> 01:27.947
All right, maybe I was
a little bit scared.

01:27.972 --> 01:30.277
But the point is is I
always like to keep it real.

01:30.302 --> 01:32.281
That's why I'm so proud
to be a part of building

01:32.306 --> 01:35.170
the new Central L.A. Youth Center.

01:35.425 --> 01:37.458
This place is very important to me.

01:37.527 --> 01:39.026
'Cause not only am I a movie star,

01:39.051 --> 01:41.520
but I'm also one of you guys.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.697
I grew up an orphan.

01:46.697 --> 01:48.663
And I never liked that word.

01:48.688 --> 01:51.572
Each and every one of you have
a story as to how you got here.

01:51.641 --> 01:55.325
My story's about an eight-year-old
kid from Lone Grove, Oklahoma

01:55.350 --> 01:57.699
whose dad was killed by a drunk driver.

01:58.147 --> 02:00.717
A boy who lost his mother to cancer...

02:00.742 --> 02:02.677
and ended up on the streets.

02:02.702 --> 02:05.203
The good news is is where you start...

02:05.228 --> 02:06.582
is just the beginning.

02:06.607 --> 02:09.608
Like a movie, your life is a story.

02:10.038 --> 02:12.005
Nobody gets to write it but you.

02:12.929 --> 02:14.474
You know, it just occurred to me,

02:14.543 --> 02:16.509
you haven't been to the
Institute yet, have you?

02:16.578 --> 02:18.845
No, not yet.

02:19.195 --> 02:21.715
You know, IHM is such a
big part of Kyle's life,

02:21.783 --> 02:24.780
I think you'd wanna experience it, too.

02:25.053 --> 02:27.759
I wanna experience
everything in Kyle's life...

02:27.784 --> 02:30.590
including the Institute at some point.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.943
Well, we should get you in
the intro workshop, then.

02:33.990 --> 02:36.786
Did Kyle tell you I
was just cast in a play?

02:36.811 --> 02:38.849
Yeah, that's great.

02:39.331 --> 02:41.729
But you can never be too
busy to work on yourself.

02:41.798 --> 02:43.798
I know it's hard...

02:44.410 --> 02:46.090
What is it you're afraid of?

02:46.115 --> 02:49.036
I know it's a lot easier
just to close yourself off.

- Hey.

03:24.859 --> 03:26.392
You working today?

03:26.460 --> 03:28.434
Just here to watch and support.

03:28.459 --> 03:31.493
- Nice.
- And to say congratulations.

03:31.857 --> 03:34.466
I read on "Deadline"
you're going to direct.

03:34.535 --> 03:36.135
Did you?

03:36.203 --> 03:39.127
- Must be true, then.
- You are going to be amazing.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.710
- Hey.
- Hello, sir.

03:41.735 --> 03:43.201
- How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

03:43.292 --> 03:45.393
Good. Did I see your name on the list

03:45.461 --> 03:47.695
- for the new awareness seminar?
- You did.

03:47.764 --> 03:49.652
- I'm really excited.
- Excellent.

03:49.677 --> 03:51.800
You keeping this knucklehead in line?

03:51.825 --> 03:53.692
More like the other way around.

03:57.385 --> 03:59.350
She's working hard.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.911
Exactly.

04:01.191 --> 04:04.119
Well, a little enthusiasm never hurt.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.761
Speaking of which, I spoke to Megan

04:06.786 --> 04:08.809
about taking the workshop at IHM.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.401
Oh, you did? What'd you say?

04:11.469 --> 04:13.869
Oh, I didn't... didn't push,
but it's been two months, man.

04:13.938 --> 04:15.337
She's a huge part of your life.

04:15.362 --> 04:17.076
She hasn't set foot in the place.

04:18.108 --> 04:20.853
Kyle, the writer's on set if you
wanna go through your changes.

04:20.879 --> 04:22.410
Good. Thanks.

04:24.213 --> 04:25.740
Let me talk to Megan.

04:31.490 --> 04:33.290
How does he seem to you?

04:33.359 --> 04:34.625
A little distant.

04:34.693 --> 04:36.360
Has been for a few days. Why?

04:36.385 --> 04:38.910
Because this is the third time he's
asked for a rewrite on this scene,

04:38.935 --> 04:41.098
and we're already behind schedule.

04:41.123 --> 04:43.137
- Well, how is the scene?
- The scene is fine.

04:43.162 --> 04:44.555
It's him that's not right.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.578
Well, apparently Megan's
very busy doing a play.

04:47.603 --> 04:51.266
We both know he's used
to having... an outlet.

04:52.252 --> 04:55.353
You know, Terence, not
everything is about sex.

04:55.430 --> 04:57.130
Not for Kyle at least.

04:57.198 --> 04:59.999
Can we have first team
in for rehearsal, please?

05:04.583 --> 05:07.351
I spent the entire flight at the window,

05:07.419 --> 05:09.720
staring down at the clouds,

05:09.789 --> 05:12.389
looking for patches of ground to appear.

05:12.458 --> 05:15.273
I know that window. I
see it at night when I...

05:15.298 --> 05:17.098
Okay, stop, please.

05:20.743 --> 05:23.878
I have no idea what
either of you are doing

05:23.947 --> 05:26.709
besides just saying the words.

05:26.734 --> 05:29.673
This is the most important
moment of the act.

05:29.698 --> 05:34.040
They are finally telling
the truth... or trying to.

05:34.108 --> 05:36.808
Oh. Yeah, I-I didn't get that.

05:36.877 --> 05:38.477
Which is exactly my point.

05:38.545 --> 05:39.845
There is never a moment in this play

05:39.913 --> 05:42.124
where you are not making a choice, Owen.

05:42.149 --> 05:44.045
Otherwise, we all die.

05:44.070 --> 05:46.283
I don't think the audience
will get it either,

05:46.308 --> 05:48.157
no matter what choice we make.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.483
Excuse me?

05:49.508 --> 05:51.153
I think the importance of the moment

05:51.198 --> 05:53.899
is gonna get lost in the metaphor.

05:53.924 --> 05:55.957
Lost in the metaphor.

05:56.070 --> 05:59.771
Wow. That is insanely deep.

05:59.796 --> 06:00.959
It's...

06:00.984 --> 06:03.245
Let's take it from the
beginning of the scene.

06:03.270 --> 06:04.855
... just my opinion.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.679
The metaphor is what the writing is.

06:06.748 --> 06:09.324
That's what makes it a play
and not some processed rubbish

06:09.349 --> 06:12.144
we spoon-feed an
audience. Now back to one!

06:12.169 --> 06:14.003
Look, we love the writing.

06:14.028 --> 06:18.331
It's dense and complex, and
it constantly makes you think.

06:18.475 --> 06:20.609
But if you're gonna ask
the audience to do the work,

06:20.678 --> 06:21.910
don't you have to reward them?

06:21.979 --> 06:23.311
I'm not asking them to work for it.

06:23.336 --> 06:27.068
I'm asking you. I am telling you.

06:27.584 --> 06:28.876
Yeah.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.041
Reward them with what?

06:31.066 --> 06:32.466
Clarity.

06:32.534 --> 06:34.334
At some point, they're
gonna want you to just

06:34.403 --> 06:36.371
come out and say it.

06:39.041 --> 06:42.518
We are completely wasting our time here.

06:48.381 --> 06:51.502
So... are we on a ten or...

06:53.289 --> 06:54.701
He seems nice.

06:54.726 --> 06:57.138
What are you doing here?

06:57.964 --> 07:00.331
I got some downtime. I
thought I'd take you to lunch.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:02.603 --> 07:04.774
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

07:05.116 --> 07:07.283
- All right.
- Okay!

07:07.722 --> 07:10.158
Noodles and seaweed on a hot dog.

07:10.205 --> 07:11.590
You think I'm gonna like this?

07:11.659 --> 07:12.939
I know you will.

07:12.964 --> 07:15.288
I was right about
Carlito's Tacos, wasn't I?

07:15.313 --> 07:17.179
Aw, the first day we met.

07:17.446 --> 07:18.945
Best day of my life.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.268
All right, I'm doing this for you.

07:20.293 --> 07:21.869
- All right.
- Okay.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.702
Mm. Hmm.

07:26.595 --> 07:28.028
You know what?

07:28.076 --> 07:29.509
It's way better than it looks.

07:29.578 --> 07:32.210
- I know what you like.
- Yeah, you do.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.316
So the day at Carlito's,
do you remember...

07:36.385 --> 07:38.638
when I talked about the
Institute for a little bit?

07:38.663 --> 07:41.020
- Sure.
- Did I freak you out at all?

07:41.135 --> 07:43.707
- Hey, bro, check it out!
- No. Mm-mm.

07:44.009 --> 07:47.395
I can see how good
it's been for you. Why?

07:47.420 --> 07:48.819
Because you haven't
really mentioned anything

07:48.844 --> 07:50.953
about wanting to get involved.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.610
Did Terence put you up to this?

07:55.635 --> 07:58.903
Forget Terence. This is me asking.

08:01.301 --> 08:03.268
Honestly, I mean...

08:03.336 --> 08:04.782
I had my fill of the Institute

08:04.807 --> 08:06.521
when Terence bailed out Brandon Drake.

08:06.546 --> 08:08.062
I hear you.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.821
That was a bad night.

08:09.846 --> 08:12.614
I just don't want that to be
your impression of the Institute.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.925
You know, maybe that's not fair, but...

08:15.195 --> 08:17.295
it's a big part of my life for a reason.

08:17.526 --> 08:20.728
Look, all I'm asking is that you
take the introductory workshop.

08:20.796 --> 08:24.293
If you hate it, we don't ever
have to talk about IHM again.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.333
But I think you're gonna like it.

08:26.402 --> 08:28.624
I mean, I'm already
batting 1.000, right?

08:34.169 --> 08:35.580
_

08:35.605 --> 08:38.003
_

08:43.767 --> 08:45.238
Is everything okay?

08:45.344 --> 08:47.571
Yeah, it's just a business manager

08:47.596 --> 08:50.163
all over my ass about taxes.

08:51.895 --> 08:54.529
No. Run and hide... this is
exactly what I was afraid of.

08:54.598 --> 08:57.132
It's a couple of days at
an introductory workshop.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.084
- How's it gonna hurt?
- That's how they hook you.

09:00.109 --> 09:02.276
They get you to go
in to just try it out.

09:02.345 --> 09:04.312
And then they make it
so you cannot leave.

09:04.380 --> 09:06.410
Like, there's a new guy at my work

09:06.435 --> 09:09.069
whose ex-boyfriend's sister
started off the exact same way.

09:09.138 --> 09:10.737
Sounds like a reliable source.

09:10.806 --> 09:12.603
And she got really into it,

09:12.628 --> 09:14.029
and then when she tried to get out,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.029
they started totally harassing her.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.974
Harassing her how?

09:17.999 --> 09:19.824
Harassing her... spying on her,

09:19.869 --> 09:21.933
following her everywhere.

09:21.958 --> 09:24.173
She literally couldn't take it
anymore and actually went back to them.

09:24.198 --> 09:25.554
'Cause that's what they do.

09:25.579 --> 09:27.751
It's like, once you're in,
they have all your secrets

09:27.776 --> 09:29.676
so they own your ass.

09:29.745 --> 09:33.141
And then you're just, you know,
their little self-help zombie.

09:33.166 --> 09:34.932
You think about that while I pee.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.611
Look, don't listen to Hope.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.014
She doesn't know what the
hell she's talking about.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.949
What have you heard?

09:45.473 --> 09:49.440
Full disclosure: I've
taken the workshop myself.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.449
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.474 --> 09:55.049
So remember that guy James
I met at Kyle's party?

09:55.074 --> 09:57.549
- Yeah.
- He hooked me up.

09:57.745 --> 10:00.132
- After we hooked up.
- Wow.

10:00.201 --> 10:02.159
So what was it like?

10:02.184 --> 10:03.726
Great.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.570
Wait, are we talking about the hook-up,

10:05.595 --> 10:06.766
or are we talking about the Institute...

10:06.791 --> 10:08.094
- The workshop.
- All right.

10:08.119 --> 10:10.057
You know, it... it's intense.

10:10.082 --> 10:12.352
But it's a lot of soul
searching, you know?

10:12.377 --> 10:13.739
Yeah.

10:14.034 --> 10:15.786
I don't know.

10:15.811 --> 10:18.145
I mean, it's one thing to
be involved with someone

10:18.170 --> 10:20.203
who wants me to look at myself.

10:20.457 --> 10:21.856
You know, reveal myself.

10:21.881 --> 10:24.629
You know, I could figure
out how to do that.

10:24.947 --> 10:27.323
But when it's in the middle
of a group of strangers, how...

10:27.348 --> 10:29.800
Mm-mm. No, Megan. You
don't have to say anything

10:29.825 --> 10:31.458
you don't wanna say.

10:31.483 --> 10:33.669
You can keep your past to yourself.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.268
Yeah.

10:35.293 --> 10:37.387
And as long as you're with Kyle,

10:37.412 --> 10:40.023
this is just gonna keep coming up.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.370
Right.

10:42.632 --> 10:43.891
Yeah.

10:59.767 --> 11:02.112
You gotta stop blowing
up my phone, Drea.

11:02.137 --> 11:03.771
It isn't cool.

11:04.232 --> 11:05.799
He's been asking to see you.

11:05.867 --> 11:07.567
You coulda said that in a text.

11:07.636 --> 11:10.897
The doctors are giving up, Kyle.

11:11.606 --> 11:14.314
He's going to die soon.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.955
Yeah, well, that doesn't
make me like him any better.

11:17.980 --> 11:20.234
He's still our father.

11:20.941 --> 11:23.388
You asked me to pay his hospital bills,

11:23.413 --> 11:25.821
and I shouldn't even have done that.

11:26.757 --> 11:29.098
Stop contacting me.

11:47.406 --> 11:48.866
Welcome.

11:49.057 --> 11:51.595
Let me start by telling you what
I am not going to ask you to do

11:51.620 --> 11:53.476
over the next couple days...

11:53.501 --> 11:56.402
anything that you don't want to do.

11:56.471 --> 12:00.312
All I ask, while you're here,
is that you make a commitment.

12:00.927 --> 12:02.699
Anyone can do that, right?

12:02.724 --> 12:04.347
I'm not talking about
a commitment to me.

12:04.372 --> 12:05.938
I'm not talking about a
commitment to this group

12:05.985 --> 12:07.260
or even to the Institute.

12:07.285 --> 12:08.918
But I am talking about a commitment

12:08.987 --> 12:13.089
to being present and open...

12:13.157 --> 12:15.458
and truthful with yourself.

12:15.526 --> 12:19.773
I'm talking about you
making a commitment to you.

12:21.952 --> 12:24.384
His half sister must be
depositing the checks.

12:24.409 --> 12:26.067
It took me five minutes
to find the money trail

12:26.092 --> 12:27.543
back to the hospital.

12:27.612 --> 12:30.680
So we now know what's
been bothering him.

12:32.011 --> 12:35.585
Question is, what
exactly is bothering you?

12:35.653 --> 12:37.520
Is it that he's doing
this in the first place

12:37.589 --> 12:39.722
or just that he didn't
talk to you about it?

12:39.791 --> 12:42.892
Both. We have an agreement
with these people, DeAnn.

12:42.961 --> 12:45.392
And we put a lot of work in
to get them out of his life

12:45.417 --> 12:47.330
and build a better narrative.

12:48.099 --> 12:50.090
His father is dying.

12:50.115 --> 12:53.192
We can't tell him how he's
supposed to experience that.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.994
I know. But the world thinks
his father died years ago.

12:57.605 --> 13:00.155
I'm gonna talk to him. I
understand the circumstances,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.403
but he can't just do whatever he wants.

13:02.428 --> 13:04.549
So you're gonna tell
him how you found out?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.070
Show him the photos?

13:06.095 --> 13:07.752
You're just gonna push him further away.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.849
So I'm just supposed to do nothing?

13:09.874 --> 13:11.690
His father doesn't have much time.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.573
Let's just let it play out.

13:14.554 --> 13:17.228
I'm sure he'll come to you
when he's ready, Terence.

13:17.253 --> 13:18.585
Yeah, it's not that.

13:18.610 --> 13:19.975
It's what happens in the meantime.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.126
Well, I'm going to be
with him all week on set.

13:22.151 --> 13:24.416
So if I see that this is
continuing to be an issue,

13:24.441 --> 13:25.974
I will nudge him in the right direction.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.355
I promise.

13:27.963 --> 13:30.497
Speaking of which, I
need to get back there

13:30.566 --> 13:32.900
because if we have any more delays,

13:32.968 --> 13:35.979
Andres is gonna need a
trailer load of Xanax.

13:36.407 --> 13:38.889
Don't worry, I'll save you some.

13:40.339 --> 13:43.874
So now I want you all to
picture the person in your life

13:43.950 --> 13:47.152
that you feel has
held you back the most.

13:50.346 --> 13:52.931
And as you get a clear
picture in your head,

13:52.956 --> 13:56.494
be aware of how your
body wants to move now.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.888
Follow that instinct.

14:03.516 --> 14:04.879
Okay, now everyone

14:04.904 --> 14:07.343
go to your notebooks and start writing.

14:10.537 --> 14:13.992
Anything you want, but you're
writing it to this person.

14:40.896 --> 14:43.133
Great first day, everybody.

14:43.158 --> 14:46.076
Now, remember how you're
all gonna start day two...

14:46.101 --> 14:48.501
jumping out of bed,
energized, ready to go...

14:48.526 --> 14:51.206
without using an alarm.

14:51.239 --> 14:54.687
Everybody can do this. Make
a commitment to yourself.

14:55.157 --> 14:56.943
If I could do that, I'd wear a size two

14:57.012 --> 14:59.526
and Krispy Kreme would
be out of business.

14:59.551 --> 15:02.319
Sorry, I should probably
have a better attitude.

15:02.387 --> 15:05.155
But I'm only here because my
boss, he's way into this crap

15:05.224 --> 15:06.342
and he's making us.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.781
I know what you mean.

15:07.826 --> 15:10.552
I wasn't sure I really
wanted to be here, either.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.443
So why'd you come?

15:12.468 --> 15:15.392
Honestly? For my boyfriend.

15:15.504 --> 15:17.404
Oh, I hear that.

15:17.463 --> 15:19.571
Yeah, if was getting that
sweet Kyle West loving,

15:19.605 --> 15:22.072
I'd join the Amish if he wanted me to.

15:22.277 --> 15:25.478
So, um... what's he like, really?

15:25.547 --> 15:28.743
I mean, he can't possibly
be as great as he seems.

15:28.768 --> 15:30.416
He's not.

15:30.441 --> 15:31.728
He's better.

15:31.753 --> 15:33.486
- Come on. Seriously?
- Trust me.

15:33.547 --> 15:35.247
And I'm not just saying
that, 'cause I've been around

15:35.324 --> 15:37.023
some total a-holes.

15:37.092 --> 15:38.358
Nate! Crap!

15:38.427 --> 15:40.226
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Uh, okay.

15:46.505 --> 15:48.488
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:48.513 --> 15:50.413
I couldn't find parking anywhere.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.782
When I cast you, you promised me

15:52.850 --> 15:55.089
you'd never be late to rehearsals.

15:55.114 --> 15:57.148
You made a commitment.

15:57.216 --> 15:59.856
Please don't use that word.

16:00.771 --> 16:03.096
Maybe you'd rather be spending more time

16:03.121 --> 16:05.157
with your besties at the Institute.

16:05.537 --> 16:06.959
Excuse me?

16:08.828 --> 16:10.822
I just went to check it out, and...

16:10.847 --> 16:12.982
You know what? I don't have
to explain myself to you.

16:13.007 --> 16:14.565
I'm here, I'm ready to rehearse.

16:14.634 --> 16:17.535
We can't. At least not yet, anyway.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.720
Everybody's reading the new pages.

16:20.014 --> 16:21.390
What new pages?

16:21.415 --> 16:23.219
The ones I wrote after you told me

16:23.244 --> 16:26.044
my play was too confusing.

16:26.759 --> 16:28.325
I didn't say it was confusing.

16:28.350 --> 16:31.859
No, you simply suggested it
with a series of other words.

16:31.884 --> 16:35.918
Which is exactly how a metaphor works.

16:37.968 --> 16:39.558
Start reading.

16:46.285 --> 16:49.695
It's fantastic. I read
scripts all day long.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.078
Most of them are from
very successful writers,

16:52.103 --> 16:54.069
and I can't remember the
last time one grabbed me

16:54.094 --> 16:55.593
the way this one did.

16:55.618 --> 16:57.450
- Really?
- Really.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.390
Now, I've made some notes in the margin.

16:59.430 --> 17:00.729
Nothing too extreme.

17:00.782 --> 17:02.900
The whole arson sequence, right now

17:02.941 --> 17:05.901
is buried under a lot of stuff
that nobody's gonna care about.

17:05.970 --> 17:09.976
So I want you to really put
some thought into the third act.

17:10.001 --> 17:13.655
And then I really think we
should do something with this.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.229
Thank you.

17:16.663 --> 17:19.691
I'm sorry about the
way I went about this.

17:19.715 --> 17:22.183
I... have this side of me...

17:22.252 --> 17:23.685
Stop right there.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.586
That side of yourself that
you're about to tell me

17:26.655 --> 17:29.118
that you're ashamed of is fearless...

17:29.488 --> 17:31.957
... and destructive.

17:31.982 --> 17:34.249
... and all over this script.

17:34.291 --> 17:38.025
And I find that very attractive.

17:39.882 --> 17:44.488
So... I'd like to keep my
husband out of this from here on.

17:45.115 --> 17:47.682
I don't know if you're ready for me.

17:47.925 --> 17:50.162
But I guess we'll find out.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.609
No.

17:58.879 --> 18:01.522
Come on, man. This is bullshit.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.949
You talking to yourself?

18:06.324 --> 18:08.590
Saying it now so I don't have
to do it to the writer's face.

18:08.615 --> 18:10.600
I am not ruthless like you.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.656
I am ruthless.

18:13.077 --> 18:15.544
And he made the changes.

18:15.612 --> 18:17.245
I don't doubt that.

18:17.314 --> 18:19.341
So how was the workshop?

18:19.571 --> 18:21.004
It was amazing.

18:21.097 --> 18:22.655
I mean, it was only the first day,

18:22.680 --> 18:24.579
but it was good.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.734
I think I made a new friend.

18:27.390 --> 18:30.945
Hey, everyone from the play
is doing the bonfire thing

18:30.970 --> 18:33.705
up in Topanga later. Will you come?

18:33.773 --> 18:36.480
I really want you to meet everyone.

18:36.694 --> 18:39.510
Can't. Sorry, this scene shoots tomorrow

18:39.579 --> 18:42.180
and it's looking like I'm
gonna have to rewrite it myself.

18:42.248 --> 18:43.715
- Boo.
- Yeah.

18:43.783 --> 18:45.183
Okay.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.881
It'd be so much better
if you were with me.

18:48.686 --> 18:50.321
You're still gonna go?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.356
You're gonna be working.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.144
Is that a problem?

18:54.169 --> 18:55.380
No.

18:55.405 --> 18:59.363
- No, it's fine.
- It doesn't seem fine.

18:59.810 --> 19:01.610
It is, really.

19:01.679 --> 19:04.941
I'm just bummed that I
have to stay here and work.

19:04.966 --> 19:07.934
You want me to help you,
we could talk it out.

19:08.018 --> 19:10.328
No, no. Thank you, though.

19:10.621 --> 19:13.422
I gotta just hunker down and do it.

19:13.491 --> 19:15.584
Go, have fun.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.602
I'll try.

19:27.024 --> 19:29.324
Can't tell... Wait, wait, let me finish.

19:29.393 --> 19:32.160
So we're all on stage,
totally naked, right?

19:32.229 --> 19:33.762
We're doing the big number,
"Let the Sun Shine In,"

19:33.831 --> 19:36.598
singing and dancing, and
it just... fell out of me.

19:36.953 --> 19:39.753
On stage? Oh, my God! What did you do?

19:39.822 --> 19:42.400
What could I do? The
show must go on, right?

19:43.657 --> 19:45.282
So we all just danced around it

19:45.327 --> 19:47.327
until someone managed to
kick it off into the wings.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.129
- No!
- With... wait, wait...

19:49.197 --> 19:50.697
with a crimson trail...

19:50.765 --> 19:53.325
... the whole way.

19:54.166 --> 19:57.504
Okay, um, what do you guys do...

19:57.572 --> 19:59.682
when you need to cry for a scene?

20:00.095 --> 20:02.643
I think about my paycheck.

20:02.989 --> 20:05.056
I've never really had a problem with it.

20:05.124 --> 20:07.212
It's kinda like a switch for me.

20:07.237 --> 20:09.221
Just comes on when I need it.

20:09.503 --> 20:11.004
Uh, what about you, Jen?

20:12.386 --> 20:15.951
Oh, um, I...

20:16.090 --> 20:18.958
I think about my baby who died.

20:20.037 --> 20:21.861
Jesus Christ! Are you serious?

20:21.886 --> 20:24.693
Yeah. I was 16 when I got pregnant.

20:25.034 --> 20:27.010
I knew that I didn't want to keep it,

20:27.035 --> 20:29.903
but my parents... they
were really religious.

20:29.928 --> 20:33.964
So... I tried to take care of it myself.

20:34.444 --> 20:37.507
I heard there are ways...
things you can drink.

20:37.532 --> 20:38.865
But it didn't work.

20:38.890 --> 20:42.932
Which was good, because
I... I changed my mind.

20:44.087 --> 20:47.855
And maybe it was hormones, but...

20:49.425 --> 20:54.245
I fell in love with that baby inside me.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.005
So I carried him for
the whole nine months.

20:58.401 --> 21:01.801
He only lived for a few
days after he was born.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.735
Patrick.

21:05.084 --> 21:07.817
That was gonna be his name.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.411
When I have to cry, I just pinch myself

21:13.436 --> 21:14.729
really, really hard.

21:16.571 --> 21:18.203
That explains a lot.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.832
Come on, Liam. Say it.

21:23.673 --> 21:27.701
If I say it, is that
gonna change anything?

21:27.726 --> 21:30.008
They think you're too
far gone to stop me.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.063
No, no, no. Don't write that.

21:33.131 --> 21:34.629
It's already in.

21:34.654 --> 21:36.558
- That was really good.
- Really?

21:36.583 --> 21:38.282
- Yeah.
- Okay, keep it.

21:38.307 --> 21:39.725
Then the next line,

21:39.750 --> 21:41.224
Zev crosses over to the wall,

21:41.249 --> 21:42.607
thinking...

21:43.842 --> 21:45.842
Somebody's at the driveway gate.
You want me to get rid of them?

21:45.867 --> 21:46.877
No, no, it's probably Megan.

21:46.902 --> 21:48.632
She must have left the party early.

22:03.096 --> 22:05.923
Sorry to just drop in,
but I was at a CAA party

22:05.948 --> 22:09.836
literally right down the
street and I thought, I'm bored.

22:09.861 --> 22:12.920
I wonder what Kyle and his
girlfriend are up to right now.

22:14.765 --> 22:16.198
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:16.267 --> 22:18.294
Megan is at a bonfire.

22:18.319 --> 22:21.104
Oh. That sounds sort of fun.

22:21.129 --> 22:22.797
Why aren't you there?

22:22.868 --> 22:25.007
Had to work on this scene for tomorrow.

22:25.032 --> 22:26.833
You running lines? Do you need help?

22:26.901 --> 22:28.350
Doing some rewrites, actually.

22:28.461 --> 22:30.904
Oh, taking a pass. Must be nice.

22:30.929 --> 22:34.882
You know, someday I will have
that as a part of my contract.

22:35.416 --> 22:37.520
Your house is unbelievable.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.612
Do you need to get that?

22:44.295 --> 22:45.400
No.

22:46.721 --> 22:48.688
Can I ask you a question?

22:48.757 --> 22:50.461
Sure.

22:51.326 --> 22:54.079
Do you think that redemption exists?

22:54.104 --> 22:56.638
Wow, that's quite a question.

22:56.706 --> 22:59.374
It's supposedly what
this scene is about.

22:59.399 --> 23:03.769
A man is haunted by everything
that he did in his past.

23:03.858 --> 23:07.524
So if he destroys the man
that taught him to do it,

23:08.429 --> 23:11.831
is he... changed in some way?

23:11.900 --> 23:14.619
Like, does anything change?

23:15.637 --> 23:17.310
Maybe not.

23:18.984 --> 23:21.203
- That's heavy.
- Yeah.

23:21.798 --> 23:24.065
That's why I was
asking about redemption.

23:24.134 --> 23:26.768
Maybe it's just an idea in the movies...

23:27.089 --> 23:28.636
not real.

23:29.113 --> 23:32.400
I went to Catholic school,
so that's a tricky one for me.

23:32.425 --> 23:36.056
But I have been right where you are...

23:36.517 --> 23:38.417
you know, when you're
trying to make something work

23:38.486 --> 23:42.823
and it just doesn't feel right in here.

23:45.707 --> 23:47.438
I can stay a while.

23:48.390 --> 23:50.224
Help you get through it.

23:54.452 --> 23:55.944
Thank you.

23:57.130 --> 23:59.237
But I gotta do this myself.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.112
You sure?

24:02.944 --> 24:04.518
Yeah.

24:04.946 --> 24:06.383
Okay.

24:06.938 --> 24:10.656
Well, if you change your
mind and you wanna talk...

24:11.711 --> 24:13.919
I'll be up for a while.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.114
Take care of yourself.

24:18.410 --> 24:19.934
You too.

24:23.239 --> 24:26.074
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24:26.572 --> 24:28.673
Why is no one in the hot tub?

24:35.329 --> 24:36.527
Ooh!

24:37.929 --> 24:39.650
It's incredible!

24:39.675 --> 24:41.542
Don't let me stop you.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.367
Yeah. No, thanks.

24:43.970 --> 24:47.052
I've had enough embarrassing
exposure this year.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.939
Those photos.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.628
Didn't see 'em.

24:50.653 --> 24:52.584
So you're the one.

24:52.617 --> 24:56.008
If I had, you probably
wouldn't have anything

24:56.033 --> 24:57.966
to be embarrassed about.

24:58.218 --> 25:00.194
Holy shit!

25:00.219 --> 25:02.143
Was that a compliment?

25:02.188 --> 25:05.690
Oh, come on. I'm not
that much of an asshole.

25:05.758 --> 25:08.693
I just want the work
to be great, you know?

25:08.761 --> 25:10.330
It's going to be great.

25:10.355 --> 25:12.722
It's going to be a bloody disaster.

25:12.791 --> 25:15.759
That much is completely clear to me.

25:15.827 --> 25:18.762
- Owen is just...
- No, he's not...

25:18.830 --> 25:20.946
- He's awful, Megan.
- ... bad.

25:20.971 --> 25:23.404
He can't take direction.

25:23.473 --> 25:26.377
His performance never changes.

25:27.677 --> 25:30.124
- So pinch him.
- I'd rather hit him with a brick.

25:30.149 --> 25:31.715
No, I'm serious, Nate.

25:31.740 --> 25:35.430
Like, he just sat here and he
told us what he does to cry.

25:35.455 --> 25:38.456
You know, you need to work
with him on that level.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.228
Not everybody thinks like you do.

25:42.455 --> 25:44.955
You don't seem to have a problem.

25:45.049 --> 25:46.519
Why is that?

25:47.282 --> 25:49.611
I don't know, I just don't.

25:50.659 --> 25:53.352
Ever since I read the play, it's like...

25:54.231 --> 25:57.732
the voices of the characters
have already been in my head...

25:57.801 --> 25:59.603
for a long time.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.616
Maybe you can explain that.

26:12.334 --> 26:14.234
I... I have to go.

26:14.303 --> 26:16.236
- Megan, wait.
- No, I can't. I can't.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.038
- I can't do this.
- Megan.

Mm.

No! No, no, no, no.

27:08.223 --> 27:10.621
Oh, God.

27:10.701 --> 27:12.041
Fuck!

27:15.013 --> 27:16.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:16.370 --> 27:17.764
I can't talk right now, I'm really...

27:17.833 --> 27:20.100
- Oh, shit.
- Are you okay?

27:20.169 --> 27:21.255
What's going on?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.403
I had a really weird night last night.

27:23.472 --> 27:25.197
I kissed my director.

27:25.222 --> 27:27.360
And now I'm gonna be late
for my Institute workshop,

27:27.408 --> 27:30.495
'cause apparently I
can't make a commitment...

27:30.520 --> 27:32.346
- ... to anything.
- Okay, wait.

27:32.414 --> 27:34.024
Back up to that first thing again.

27:34.049 --> 27:36.427
And I think that Hope is right.

27:36.452 --> 27:39.783
I think that somebody is
following me in a blue BMW.

27:39.808 --> 27:44.257
Oh, please. I told you not to
listen to Hope's crazy shit.

27:44.326 --> 27:45.692
What's going on with you?

27:45.761 --> 27:47.140
It's gonna have to wait.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.562
I'm crazy late already.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.001
Oh, I'll call you later.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.676
So how many of you jumped out of bed

27:59.738 --> 28:02.005
at 7:00 this morning,
energized and ready to go

28:02.074 --> 28:04.231
without an alarm?

28:08.601 --> 28:11.068
Megan, you didn't have to
rush to make it here on time?

28:11.137 --> 28:13.791
Nope. Woke up at 7:00
right on the button.

28:13.816 --> 28:15.721
Right on.

28:16.841 --> 28:18.836
What is the point of lying

28:18.861 --> 28:21.295
about breaking a
commitment to ourselves?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.153
Think about that for a second.

28:23.548 --> 28:26.771
Building your column
starts with a clear vision

28:26.796 --> 28:28.885
of what you want your life to be.

28:28.953 --> 28:30.980
The vision becomes real
when you follow through

28:31.005 --> 28:32.855
on your commitment to make it real.

28:32.924 --> 28:35.324
That's what the wake
up exercise is about.

28:35.393 --> 28:38.502
Declare an intention and make it happen.

28:38.527 --> 28:40.362
But first things first.

28:41.766 --> 28:46.092
Diana, what's your
deepest, darkest secret?

28:47.106 --> 28:49.417
Something you've never told anyone.

28:52.071 --> 28:54.554
Don't... I'm sorry to
put you on the spot.

28:54.579 --> 28:57.908
Listen, the point of that question...

28:57.977 --> 29:01.411
is that you cannot have a
clear picture of your future

29:01.480 --> 29:04.214
if you are held hostage by your past.

29:04.306 --> 29:06.503
Now here's the dirty little secret:

29:06.773 --> 29:08.986
you're free to go at any time.

29:09.394 --> 29:12.462
No one's holding you hostage but you.

29:13.637 --> 29:16.295
Okay, let's all find a partner.
We're gonna build some trust,

29:16.320 --> 29:19.321
and how we're gonna do that
is we are gonna share something

29:19.390 --> 29:21.190
surprising about ourselves.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.885
Doesn't matter what it
is, as long as it's true.

29:23.910 --> 29:25.394
Okay?

29:30.101 --> 29:32.201
What do you say? Partners?

29:32.270 --> 29:33.712
Great.

29:35.225 --> 29:37.047
Okay.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.074
- I'll go first.
- Mm-hmm.

29:39.143 --> 29:40.823
Um...

29:41.286 --> 29:43.360
James was right.

29:43.385 --> 29:45.003
I did not wake up on time,

29:45.028 --> 29:47.148
and I have no idea how
the hell he knew that.

29:47.173 --> 29:48.894
Oh, please. That's easy.

29:48.919 --> 29:51.019
Your sweater's on inside out.

29:51.055 --> 29:54.478
And that wasn't surprising,
so you owe me another one.

29:55.328 --> 29:58.730
Tell me something about Kyle West.

29:58.775 --> 30:00.870
I have a very visual mind.

30:04.732 --> 30:07.472
Ooh. Thank God for this break.

30:07.497 --> 30:10.172
- I though I was gonna burst.
- I can't believe we had to commit...

30:10.197 --> 30:11.733
to no food at all until lunch.

30:11.802 --> 30:13.101
I'm starving.

30:13.170 --> 30:14.769
Well I might be able to help you out.

30:14.838 --> 30:17.305
I know it's verboten, but
I brought some granola bars.

30:17.374 --> 30:19.274
Oh, hell yeah! Bust them out, girl.

30:19.342 --> 30:20.742
They're in here somewhere. Oh...

30:20.811 --> 30:22.062
Oh, let me help you with that.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.495
- Wait, no, I-I got it.
- What the...

30:24.818 --> 30:26.134
No, no, no, I got it.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.751
What the hell?

30:27.776 --> 30:29.759
This is a voice recorder.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.150
- You've been spying on me?
- No.

30:33.175 --> 30:34.599
Trying to get me to
say things about Kyle.

30:34.668 --> 30:35.767
No, that's not what I'm doing.

30:35.836 --> 30:38.004
- Bullshit.
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:38.029 --> 30:41.149
I'll tell you. Just please
keep your voice down.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.933
I'm a journalist.

30:43.958 --> 30:47.145
I'm doing an undercover
piece on the Institute.

30:47.214 --> 30:49.654
Sure, they put out this positive image

30:49.679 --> 30:51.646
about helping the
community and all that.

30:51.715 --> 30:54.382
But there are stories about some
pretty dark shit going on here.

30:54.451 --> 30:56.404
You do know that, right?

30:56.478 --> 30:57.844
I've heard things.

30:57.869 --> 30:59.020
Yeah, and nobody's talking about it.

30:59.089 --> 31:00.788
That's the problem.

31:00.857 --> 31:03.537
When my piece comes out, I'm
blowing the whole thing wide open.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.428
I'm bringing this place down.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.897
I know your boyfriend is into it,

31:08.922 --> 31:11.865
but I don't think he knows
what's really going on.

31:12.301 --> 31:14.502
If he did, he'd want
the truth to come out.

31:14.571 --> 31:16.274
Don't you think?

31:17.012 --> 31:19.841
Break time's over.
We're starting up again.

31:20.353 --> 31:21.819
We're coming.

31:24.337 --> 31:26.933
Be cool. Please.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.846
Wow.

31:41.252 --> 31:44.029
Well, this is really beautifully done.

31:46.657 --> 31:48.691
But we can't shoot it.

31:48.759 --> 31:50.246
What are you talking about?

31:50.271 --> 31:53.893
Kyle, this is the climax
of a huge, big budget movie.

31:53.918 --> 31:55.521
The scene is about an assassin

31:55.546 --> 31:57.140
who's been running away his whole life

31:57.165 --> 31:59.564
finally confronting the
man who made him that way,

31:59.589 --> 32:01.087
and you've written away from that.

32:01.112 --> 32:04.134
Yeah, I disagree. I...
I feel like I gave..

32:04.159 --> 32:06.894
Zev's character humanity
and... and texture.

32:06.919 --> 32:09.982
No, you give Zev humanity as an actor.

32:10.114 --> 32:12.789
But as a writer, you have him brooding,

32:12.814 --> 32:15.564
speaking these beautifully
written speeches about redemption,

32:15.589 --> 32:17.930
when he needs to be taking action.

32:18.365 --> 32:19.865
He's avoiding reality.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.882
I don't know. I...

32:25.524 --> 32:27.672
Maybe I can look at it again. I just...

32:27.741 --> 32:29.711
No. No more delays.

32:29.957 --> 32:32.744
I need you to do whatever you need
to do to get your head straight

32:32.813 --> 32:35.234
because we are shooting
this scene later today.

32:35.259 --> 32:37.536
The original version, as written.

33:00.947 --> 33:03.514
So you decided to come.

33:04.081 --> 33:05.983
See the old man off.

33:08.250 --> 33:11.800
Look, I know I made mistakes.

33:12.835 --> 33:15.970
Wasn't much of a role model.

33:16.668 --> 33:19.902
But I did the best I could.

33:21.444 --> 33:24.281
You need to know that, son.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.758
It's the last one.

33:50.848 --> 33:54.082
I watched as those men beat that boy...

33:54.151 --> 33:55.848
half to death.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.438
They didn't even know him.

34:01.797 --> 34:05.122
They just did it because
of the color of his skin.

34:05.924 --> 34:08.697
I wanted to stop them.
I wanted to do something.

34:08.723 --> 34:11.511
But I couldn't. I couldn't even move.

34:11.536 --> 34:14.335
I was so afraid.

34:14.571 --> 34:17.770
And when they finally left, they said...

34:17.839 --> 34:20.373
not to say anything to anybody.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.282
Ever.

34:24.545 --> 34:26.922
And I never did until now.

34:28.382 --> 34:31.516
I always felt so ashamed.

34:31.746 --> 34:34.152
How about now? How do you feel?

34:35.114 --> 34:37.505
Better.

34:38.399 --> 34:41.967
Because that secret
no longer controls you.

34:42.911 --> 34:44.728
Here's my secret:

34:46.498 --> 34:48.194
This is...

34:49.164 --> 34:52.146
what I was afraid to
share with the world.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.351
And now when I look
at it, it just tells me

34:58.376 --> 35:00.376
how far I've come.

35:00.819 --> 35:03.440
The good stuff is just beginning.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.302
Trust me.

35:10.212 --> 35:14.515
Go ahead. You think if
I'm gone it's all over?

35:15.761 --> 35:17.408
You're done?

35:19.517 --> 35:22.819
No, Liam. I don't.

35:31.236 --> 35:33.658
But I gotta start somewhere.

35:35.118 --> 35:36.806
And cut! That's a cut!

35:38.641 --> 35:41.175
Fantastic. Brilliant.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.115
We were riveted back there.

35:45.517 --> 35:48.518
On this one, let's dial
the emotions back a hair.

35:49.176 --> 35:51.377
Right. Yeah.

35:51.402 --> 35:53.386
All right, let's go again.

35:54.693 --> 35:58.296
Secrets do so much more
harm to us than truth.

35:58.321 --> 35:59.954
Truth is freedom.

36:00.023 --> 36:03.309
So what are we actually afraid of?

36:03.893 --> 36:05.608
Who wants to go next?

36:16.100 --> 36:18.134
Right. Okay.

36:18.159 --> 36:21.577
Um, Nina, would you please
go with these gentlemen?

36:22.443 --> 36:24.243
Take your things with you.

36:24.479 --> 36:25.611
Wh...

36:25.716 --> 36:28.145
Why? What's going on?

36:32.446 --> 36:34.053
Hey, you can't do that.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.117
We need you to come with us.

36:38.142 --> 36:40.375
What are you doing? Let go of me!

36:40.804 --> 36:42.404
This is your fault. You
did this, didn't you?

36:42.429 --> 36:44.246
You di... let go of me!

36:51.116 --> 36:53.878
... Not to say anything
to anybody... ever.

36:54.524 --> 36:56.659
And I never did until now.

36:58.139 --> 37:00.261
I appreciate what you did.

37:00.330 --> 37:03.670
That woman, Nina... if
that's even her real name...

37:03.996 --> 37:05.495
clearly had an axe to grind.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.465
It doesn't feel great,
ratting someone out.

37:08.533 --> 37:12.335
But there are people sharing
some really personal stories

37:12.404 --> 37:15.814
that shouldn't end up in
some random magazine article.

37:17.542 --> 37:19.901
Well, I should probably head back.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.186
Megan.

37:23.211 --> 37:24.915
Your workshop's almost over.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.740
Don't just be a spectator.

37:26.765 --> 37:29.539
If you really wanna know
what IHM's all about,

37:29.564 --> 37:30.887
do the work.

37:58.853 --> 38:02.439
So... did you find out what you wanted?

38:03.961 --> 38:06.826
Not the expected outcome, honestly.

38:07.958 --> 38:10.071
Sometimes the ones
who are most resistant

38:10.096 --> 38:12.484
end up with the biggest breakthroughs.

38:16.537 --> 38:20.469
Okay. We have one last
member of our esteemed group

38:20.494 --> 38:22.695
who has yet to share.

38:24.884 --> 38:26.490
Megan.

38:26.515 --> 38:28.992
Your deepest, darkest secret.

38:29.622 --> 38:31.455
I... I'm not really sure.

38:31.524 --> 38:33.691
Well, you don't have to.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.259
But I promise you,
whatever you're afraid

38:35.328 --> 38:36.727
is gonna happen won't.

38:36.796 --> 38:40.105
And I'll be right here
to help you clean up

38:40.130 --> 38:42.731
if you start blubbering like I did.

38:46.863 --> 38:49.680
I've been living with this for so long.

38:50.777 --> 38:52.987
I haven't told anyone.

38:53.012 --> 38:55.445
No one, except my best friend.

38:55.470 --> 38:58.450
Well, you're with a whole
group of best friends now.

38:58.475 --> 39:00.351
It's safe here.

39:06.749 --> 39:09.049
I thought everything would be all right.

39:09.074 --> 39:12.361
I thought changing my mind was enough.

39:12.386 --> 39:14.609
But it wasn't.

39:18.872 --> 39:21.946
He only lived a few
days after he was born.

39:22.255 --> 39:25.229
And they told me it was
some kind of genetic defect

39:25.254 --> 39:27.698
and that he never had a chance, but...

39:28.564 --> 39:30.301
I knew the truth.

39:33.646 --> 39:37.615
It was my fault... that Patrick died.

39:40.873 --> 39:43.015
That's what I named him.

39:43.697 --> 39:45.264
Patrick.

39:46.099 --> 39:48.687
And I still put flowers on his grave

39:48.755 --> 39:51.056
every year for his birthday.

39:55.430 --> 39:56.763
Thank you.

40:02.841 --> 40:04.364
I'm glad you told me.

40:04.389 --> 40:05.959
Yeah.

40:06.042 --> 40:08.222
And just remember, your
real family's here, bud.

40:08.247 --> 40:10.614
So you choose what to hold
onto and what to let go of.

40:10.682 --> 40:12.202
You know?

40:13.685 --> 40:15.236
Yeah, me too.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.987
Kyle's father died.

40:20.481 --> 40:21.702
Ah.

40:21.747 --> 40:23.080
He said that he'd
been sending them money

40:23.148 --> 40:25.148
for a few months, after
the insurance ran out.

40:25.217 --> 40:28.430
He also said that that was a
mistake, not sharing it with me.

40:29.355 --> 40:32.222
It was much better, letting
him come to me on his own.

40:32.291 --> 40:33.943
You were right.

40:35.736 --> 40:37.427
You're welcome.

40:38.300 --> 40:42.535
And now you get to take
me to Nobu for dinner.

40:44.573 --> 40:46.039
Okay.

40:54.449 --> 40:57.529
And I promise we'll
have proper wine glasses

40:57.554 --> 40:59.752
by the time we open.

41:00.207 --> 41:03.145
Okay, we'll pick it up
tomorrow with the prison scene.

41:03.170 --> 41:06.538
But really nice work, everybody.

41:06.563 --> 41:08.419
Great job.

41:08.642 --> 41:11.032
- Wow, thanks.
- Thanks, Nate.

41:12.479 --> 41:13.902
Well, then.

41:17.923 --> 41:20.891
Megan, can you hang back a minute?

41:27.939 --> 41:29.513
Listen,

41:30.214 --> 41:33.268
I know the right thing to say here.

41:33.606 --> 41:36.033
Last night was a mistake.

41:36.058 --> 41:38.998
We have a play to do and
we have to be professional,

41:39.320 --> 41:40.786
and what happened by the fire

41:40.811 --> 41:43.398
was just about the beer and weed.

41:44.653 --> 41:46.192
But I don't know.

41:46.852 --> 41:49.733
Something tells me
that isn't the truth...

41:49.758 --> 41:51.666
for either of us.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.822
Do you think I'm wrong?

41:57.476 --> 41:59.716
We have a play to do,

42:00.002 --> 42:02.337
and we have to be professional.

42:03.058 --> 42:04.856
Last night was a mistake.

42:31.020 --> 42:32.419
Hey.

42:34.713 --> 42:36.113
Hey.

42:36.648 --> 42:38.282
You okay?
