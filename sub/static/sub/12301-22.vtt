00:09.949 --> 00:11.234
What's up south east!

00:11.234 --> 00:14.891
Let's bring those tanned bodies
inside and have some fun.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.903
Make time PV.

00:16.903 --> 00:19.266
Live from South beach.

00:22.743 --> 00:23.806
There's no question.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.285
This game's about to get sick.

00:26.424 --> 00:29.025
because the heavyweight champion of
the world is about to rip this house

00:32.011 --> 00:37.277
Let's do it up for Mr. 10 Large.

00:44.278 --> 00:47.790
Yeah, what up, miami?
Put your hands up!

00:47.790 --> 00:50.163
It's 10 large!
The strong arm in the game!

00:50.163 --> 00:51.894
Let's go! Come on!

00:51.894 --> 00:54.185
High resolution, high definition,

00:54.185 --> 00:56.748

make the whole world listen.

00:56.748 --> 01:00.457
hold your position,
don't go backwards front line,

01:00.457 --> 01:02.252
10 large still shining,

01:02.252 --> 01:04.801
Roust with your homies,
but, boy, 10 still grinding

01:04.801 --> 01:07.589
crush them other fools
they just are silent

01:07.589 --> 01:10.179
Talking and lying,
bitching and crying,

01:10.179 --> 01:12.777
gossip and hate,
but ain't nobody buying.

01:12.777 --> 01:15.232
If Thug G, he ain't thug like me

01:15.232 --> 01:17.853
He just a bookie,
a beat gang like a bookie

01:17.853 --> 01:20.591
the hook, line and sinker,
the deep thinker,

01:20.591 --> 01:23.242
ink a autobiography
beat it, thug, You bother me,

01:23.242 --> 01:25.823
swing like a gorilla, fella.
You ain't a killer.

01:25.823 --> 01:27.015
10 large!

01:27.015 --> 01:28.444
Make some noise!

01:28.444 --> 01:33.283
10 large!

01:36.431 --> 01:37.280
Get down. get down.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.757
Get off the deck. It's shot.

01:46.420 --> 01:50.220
Look's like they were going for the singer,
but they got the body guard instead.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.605
Billy Rodman,

01:51.605 --> 01:54.100
shot three times.

01:54.727 --> 01:56.424
One's a through and through.

01:56.424 --> 01:58.110
Dispatch said there
were two victims.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.370
More if you count the guy's ego.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.110
He's over there
with his entourage.

02:03.110 --> 02:05.772
Dwaine Jackman,
a. k.a 10Large.

02:05.772 --> 02:07.577
Shot in the shoulder.

02:07.577 --> 02:09.096
You know rap?

02:09.096 --> 02:13.416
No, but I know rap sheets,
and Dwaine has a criminal past.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.704
He assures me that he's just fine.

02:15.704 --> 02:17.363
Refueses treatment.

02:17.363 --> 02:19.219
Interesting. Frank! Witnesses.

02:19.219 --> 02:20.485
What's left of the audience.

02:20.485 --> 02:24.203
We're holding on to them but in a
couple of days people would rather sing.

02:24.203 --> 02:26.644
Yes, flying bullets will
tend to do that, won't they?

02:26.644 --> 02:28.358
Is Mr. Large talking?

02:28.358 --> 02:31.347
- Not to the cops.
- Ok, but the press is fine?

02:31.347 --> 02:34.591
Yeah, no doubt this little incident
will push his release to number one.

02:34.591 --> 02:36.734
Number one,

02:36.734 --> 02:38.369
with a bullet.

03:13.549 --> 03:16.140
MIAMI
2x22 Rap Sheet

03:28.547 --> 03:30.085
Can I help you?

03:30.085 --> 03:33.882
Is Mr. Large available
for questioning?

03:36.518 --> 03:37.915
No.

03:37.915 --> 03:39.589
Okay, I noticed there's,

03:39.589 --> 03:42.397
there's blood
on your jacket.

03:42.397 --> 03:45.310
- It's a busy afternoon.
- Yeah, your client was shot.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.540
Nice Work.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.175
He's alive. / Yeah, but
your colleague isnt't.

03:49.175 --> 03:50.645
It's the job.

03:50.645 --> 03:52.976
You do it right sometimes
that's what happens.

03:52.976 --> 03:55.370
Hey, you got a
license for that thing?

03:55.370 --> 03:57.383
Of course. We all do.

03:57.383 --> 04:01.241
So it wouldn't be a problem
if I want to swab you for GSR?

04:01.495 --> 04:03.124
Whatever.

04:03.124 --> 04:05.059
Great, step over here.

04:08.375 --> 04:09.935
Excuse me.

04:09.935 --> 04:11.893
We need to ask you
a few questions.

04:11.893 --> 04:14.810
Why don't we start with who
would take a shot at you Dwaine?

04:14.810 --> 04:16.896
Take a number get in line.

04:16.896 --> 04:18.322
It's a rapper's life.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.172
That's how it is.
You know what I'm saying?

04:20.172 --> 04:21.219
No beef,

04:21.219 --> 04:22.815
no game. / Ok.

04:22.815 --> 04:26.254
Somebody should really
take a look at that arm.

04:26.254 --> 04:29.295
- I'm still breathing.
- But your bodyguard's not.

04:29.295 --> 04:31.292
So why don't you tell
me about that?

04:31.292 --> 04:33.145
Hey, look.

04:33.145 --> 04:35.265
I ain't need your help then,

04:35.265 --> 04:37.993
and I don't need it now. / Ok,

04:37.993 --> 04:40.085
that's gonna change.

04:54.016 --> 04:56.476
Got another casing.

04:57.708 --> 05:00.524
It's a Glock 45.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.369
You know what?

05:02.369 --> 05:05.563
I thought all these bodyguards
were carrying nines.

05:05.563 --> 05:07.134
You know what else?

05:07.134 --> 05:09.302
These kinds are
really spread out.

05:09.302 --> 05:12.845
Yeah, well they probably
got kicked around in all of the chaos.

05:12.845 --> 05:16.169
I just don't think they're gonna be able
to give us a position on the shooter.

05:16.169 --> 05:18.954
Probably not, but uh,

05:18.954 --> 05:22.582
may be the cameras will.
This was a live event, wasn't it?

05:28.906 --> 05:32.588
Sounds like the shooter used
the song's gunfire as a cover.

05:32.588 --> 05:34.100
You got anything wider?

05:34.100 --> 05:37.109
No, just two
hand-helds in the audience.

05:37.109 --> 05:39.452
All right,
let's see one.

05:43.724 --> 05:46.976
Well, she looks like
she has a real nice personality.

05:51.027 --> 05:53.343
All right, let's see the other one.

05:59.670 --> 06:01.743
Got one dot!
Could you freeze that?

06:07.023 --> 06:08.685
Hey, look at the phone.

06:08.685 --> 06:10.730
Cameras were banned
from the concert.

06:10.730 --> 06:13.680
Yeah, but camera phones weren't.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.082
Don't you need
a warrant or something?

06:20.082 --> 06:22.466
Yeah, if you want it locked
in evidence for three years.

06:22.466 --> 06:26.055
Yeah, or you can just give it to us
for about three hours, it's your choice.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.880
Okay, here.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.459
But what am I supposed
to do for three hours?

06:30.459 --> 06:33.322
I don't know, stop talking?

06:34.476 --> 06:36.074
Whatever.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.415
Dead B's two bullets
out of our bodyguard.

06:39.415 --> 06:40.825
Here you go Calleigh.

06:40.825 --> 06:42.203
Pulled'em out of his back.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.919
45 caliber.
Just like my casings.

06:44.919 --> 06:46.792
I'll page you
if I find anything else ok?

06:46.792 --> 06:48.431
Great, thanks Alexx.

06:55.921 --> 06:58.484
These all the pictures
from the camera phones?

06:58.484 --> 06:59.528
Yeah.

06:59.528 --> 07:01.226
So uh,

07:01.226 --> 07:03.747
I think we should be
talking about this guy.

07:03.747 --> 07:06.240
Beef with 10Large is
on the cover. / Pimp hop?

07:06.240 --> 07:07.936
Nah, it's to obvious.

07:07.936 --> 07:09.855
Well I mean he
made death threats?

07:09.855 --> 07:11.778
Yeah, but he's just talking trash.

07:11.778 --> 07:14.405
I mean, the business
is all about the streets.

07:14.405 --> 07:18.008
Right. You gotta keep
your pimp hands strong.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.764
What about you?
What've you got?

07:20.764 --> 07:22.770
Nobody with a gun.

07:22.770 --> 07:26.317
Picture quality is bad,
a lot of gaps.

07:26.317 --> 07:28.911
Take a look at that
girl in the bikini.

07:28.911 --> 07:32.489
Kinda hard not to. / No, look at,

07:32.489 --> 07:34.548
look at this guy right here.

07:34.548 --> 07:36.480
He's staring at the stage.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.803
Exactly, you're five feet from
that and you're not going to look?

07:40.290 --> 07:41.221
Yeah, you're right.

07:41.221 --> 07:44.623
Let's get this over to Tripp, see if
we can figure out who this guy is.

07:46.965 --> 07:48.548
Mr. Moran.

07:48.548 --> 07:50.572
Thug G.

07:50.572 --> 07:53.102
You were at the concert
this morning weren't you?

07:53.102 --> 07:55.076
Yeah, that's right.

07:55.076 --> 07:57.370
Large's rap is hot.

07:57.370 --> 07:58.849
Phh, should be.

07:58.849 --> 08:01.478
I wrote it. / You think
Mr. Large stole your music?

08:01.478 --> 08:03.861
I know he did man. Come on now,

08:03.861 --> 08:07.279
that punk ass should have bit my worms
all the time when we was rolling together.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.739
So this is about revenge? / Nah,

08:09.871 --> 08:15.604
I went because I want him to see
my grill every time he spit that rap.

08:15.757 --> 08:19.317
See, I like the version when
he get shot out there it's best.

08:19.678 --> 08:22.661
- Did you shoot him?
- Look I told you no, right?

08:22.661 --> 08:24.756
The song had gunfire in it.

08:24.756 --> 08:26.460
The shooter used it for cover,

08:26.460 --> 08:28.198
which he knew
this new song pretty well.

08:28.198 --> 08:30.512
Look, detective?

08:30.512 --> 08:32.659
I told you.
I didn't cap nobody.

08:32.659 --> 08:36.131
What about that 45 we found in
your place? Is that just a coincidence?

08:36.131 --> 08:38.556
It has the same caliber that
shot 10Large and his bodyguard?

08:38.556 --> 08:41.655
Yeah, that's right. / So, if we tested
the bullets, it won't match.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.909
That's what I said.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.636
- How did you get your name?
- Thug G?

08:46.636 --> 08:48.488
Yeah.

08:48.488 --> 08:51.446
Well yeah, you know I did
some major dirt back in the days.

08:51.446 --> 08:53.677
But that's in the past,
you know what I'm sayin?

08:53.677 --> 08:55.011
I did my time.

08:55.011 --> 08:56.573
Well you're about
to do some more.

08:56.573 --> 09:01.202
I'm sure you're aware 10Large has
a restraining order against you Mr. G?

09:01.202 --> 09:03.182
And you violated it.

09:03.182 --> 09:04.847
Welcome home.

09:22.288 --> 09:24.083
New CD.

09:25.143 --> 09:27.136
I was just gettin in the mood.

09:27.136 --> 09:31.771
Ok. The rounds that hit the bodyguard
didn't come from Thug G's gun.

09:31.771 --> 09:35.271
So, I'm thinking two bullets,

09:35.271 --> 09:38.071
three casings, four wounds.

09:38.071 --> 09:40.183
Ok. Billy did have a
through and through.

09:40.183 --> 09:42.837
That may have been
the one that hit 10Large.

09:47.882 --> 09:51.264
So that explains why he's still
walking around like bullets don't hurt.

09:51.264 --> 09:53.803
Billy took the full
brunt of the hit, didn't he?

09:53.803 --> 09:57.090
That means the round's still
stuck in Large's shoulder.

09:57.090 --> 09:59.258
All the more reason
to go and get it.

09:59.396 --> 10:02.209
Aight, you'all check this out.
I just wrote this.

10:02.209 --> 10:04.762
I'm shifty, verses
runnin a buck fifty.

10:04.762 --> 10:07.290
Tryin to get large
enough bank to get Brittany.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.757
I'm a do Brittany like
Bobby did Whitney.

10:09.757 --> 10:12.238
Mess her whole life up
donate my kidneys.

10:12.238 --> 10:14.679
Wake up the Vodka,
crash with the whiskey.

10:14.679 --> 10:17.624
My name hold too much
weight you can't lift it.

10:17.624 --> 10:19.428
Oh, look look look!

10:22.221 --> 10:24.326
Man, did you see that right there?

10:26.218 --> 10:28.468
Ah, look at this.

10:28.468 --> 10:29.966
You're spoilin my view man.

10:29.966 --> 10:33.504
Sorry about that but this is an awful
lot of exposure out here Dwaine.

10:33.504 --> 10:36.775
Hey listen, I'm not worried about
them dudes tryin ta come back to get me.

10:36.775 --> 10:39.955
Well, you should be.
Our shooter might not be satisfied.

10:39.955 --> 10:42.359
What you want from me cop?

10:43.248 --> 10:46.207
I wanna take a look
at that bullet in your arm.

10:48.862 --> 10:50.569
Give me a minute man.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.727
I don't care
too much for doctors.

10:58.727 --> 11:00.962
Or dead bodyguards apparently.

11:00.962 --> 11:02.122
Look,

11:02.122 --> 11:04.157
I already told you once.

11:04.157 --> 11:05.767
I don't need your help.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.495
I remember
you don't need my help.

11:07.495 --> 11:08.644
That's right.

11:08.644 --> 11:10.610
Ok, Dwaine.
Suit yourself,

11:10.610 --> 11:12.506
but I'll be back.

11:16.652 --> 11:18.941
Hey Dwaine, Dwaine.

11:31.487 --> 11:34.577
You ready to give me
that bullet now Dwaine?

12:31.367 --> 12:33.958
Okay, stay with me.
Oh, my god. Stay with me.

12:33.958 --> 12:34.981
Hold on.

12:34.981 --> 12:37.166
Hold on, okay?

12:40.883 --> 12:43.451
It's Alexx, are there any
rescue units in the building?

12:43.451 --> 12:45.450
I need a crew in the
autopsy theater immediately.

12:45.450 --> 12:47.184
I've got a live one here.

12:53.010 --> 12:54.744
Doctor Woods?

12:54.744 --> 12:57.554
My superviser said
you wanted to see me?

12:59.729 --> 13:02.170
The accident victim
your pronounced this morning?

13:02.170 --> 13:03.548
Veronica Grant.

13:03.548 --> 13:05.768
Yeah. / Yeah?

13:06.611 --> 13:10.830
She just screamed
her way out of this.

13:12.079 --> 13:15.368
I followed standard operating
procedure to the letter.

13:15.368 --> 13:18.203
Obviously very effective.

13:18.203 --> 13:20.823
The victim was nonresponsive
and there were no vital signs.

13:20.823 --> 13:22.848
EKG? / It was broken.

13:22.848 --> 13:27.748
I went manual, stethoscope
and felt for her pulse, nothing.

13:28.783 --> 13:31.885
I don't know how I missed it.

13:32.025 --> 13:33.418
Ok.

13:33.418 --> 13:36.598
Two CSIs just went
out to the scene.

13:36.598 --> 13:39.414
- They'll figure it out.
- Is she gonna be okay?

13:39.414 --> 13:40.729
I hope so.

13:40.729 --> 13:42.825
For her sake,

13:42.825 --> 13:44.940
and yours.

13:50.282 --> 13:55.137
I can see where our paramedics
messed up on the girl from the drawer.

13:55.137 --> 13:57.754
60 degree ground water
rained down on our victim,

13:57.754 --> 13:59.474
and gave her hypothermia.

13:59.474 --> 14:01.722
Yeah, mimics death,
respiratory system,

14:01.722 --> 14:04.127
blood pressure bottoms out.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.631
That's why he didn't
get any vitals.

14:12.557 --> 14:16.129
That's secondary paint transfer.

14:16.129 --> 14:18.806
There's no other body damage.

14:19.281 --> 14:22.784
Looks like this was the
only vehicle involved.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.111
So Veronica must have
hit the corner too fast,

14:26.111 --> 14:29.254
lost control and slammed
into a fire hydrator.

14:37.357 --> 14:41.206
Paramedics cut our victim's shirt off.

14:48.771 --> 14:51.681
In oder to help our evidence,

15:04.673 --> 15:06.593
I've got blood on the dash board.

15:06.593 --> 15:09.911
The paramedics found
her strapped in the driver's seat.

15:09.911 --> 15:13.231
So how did the blood get
on the passenger side.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.525
I've got a toe nail.

15:20.525 --> 15:22.525
Polished.

15:23.154 --> 15:25.718
Someone else was
in the car with her.

15:53.395 --> 15:55.737
No way.

16:05.043 --> 16:06.878
We prefer to do
this at the hospital.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.704
Psst, listen.

16:08.704 --> 16:10.683
Nobody touches me but him.

16:10.683 --> 16:13.688
- Period.
- Fair enough.

16:17.512 --> 16:19.399
Thank you very much.

16:20.704 --> 16:23.779
Damn. Nice cakes.

16:24.303 --> 16:27.318
Oh, charming.

16:29.430 --> 16:32.277
So who's taking
shots at you, Dwayne?

16:32.277 --> 16:33.697
I don't know.

16:33.697 --> 16:35.234
Thug G?

16:35.234 --> 16:37.107
He had me up for some paper.

16:37.107 --> 16:39.371
Talk about I bit his rhymes.

16:39.371 --> 16:41.144
I don't know what the hell
you just said,

16:41.144 --> 16:43.412
but we already know
you have TRO against Mr. G.

16:43.412 --> 16:48.891
And based on the fact that we had him in
custody during the drive by, it can't be him.

16:48.891 --> 16:51.256
How about this gentleman?

16:51.776 --> 16:53.590
This punk can kiss my ass,

16:53.590 --> 16:56.137
- Straight up.
- So you don't like him.

16:56.137 --> 16:58.104
You think he tried to kill you?

16:58.104 --> 16:59.668
Pimp Hop?

16:59.668 --> 17:01.707
He's stone cold mystery.

17:01.707 --> 17:05.430
That "rapper", don't pump
no fear here. You feel me?

17:05.430 --> 17:08.723
Besides, he's in Japan
right now, on tour.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.537
That's the only place
that can stand him anyway.

17:11.861 --> 17:12.849
Do you know what?

17:12.849 --> 17:16.590
It's been fun, but I'm done
talking to the one time.

17:16.590 --> 17:17.816
All right?

17:17.816 --> 17:19.589
For now.

17:22.123 --> 17:24.098
Hey, Frank.

17:24.361 --> 17:26.419
I see him.

17:27.410 --> 17:30.484
- Get your punk ass out of here. - Straight up weenie.

17:30.484 --> 17:36.083
- Bust ass punk.
- Speak up, chump.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.835
You know you rolled into
stole the rhyme bitch!

17:37.835 --> 17:39.549
Knock it off, knock it off.

17:39.549 --> 17:42.738
- You're nothing.
- You're a punk ass.

17:43.182 --> 17:44.567
Dwayne.

17:45.753 --> 17:47.259
- Enough talking.
- Dwayne.

17:47.259 --> 17:49.988
Take off. Right now.

17:52.317 --> 17:54.221
Let's move man.

18:05.475 --> 18:09.599
The bullet in 10Large matches the others
including the one they collected at drive by.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.022
So we're looking for one shooter.

18:11.022 --> 18:13.058
So with the through and
through and 10Large's injury,

18:13.058 --> 18:14.726
we can go back to the crime scene

18:14.726 --> 18:16.574
and do a reconstruction.

18:16.574 --> 18:20.499
Okay. So, according to the cell phone
stills, and the footage we have,

18:20.499 --> 18:22.967
10Large was right here.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.438
Will you be my bodyguard?

18:24.438 --> 18:26.450
I was bodyguarding Whitney.

18:27.073 --> 18:32.698
All right, so Billy was about here

18:32.698 --> 18:37.617
to the right
and slightly behind 10Large.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.579
So if we work backward,

18:39.579 --> 18:42.206
the bullet ended up in
Large's shoulder

18:42.206 --> 18:46.971
after the bullet exited
Billy's abdomen.

18:47.249 --> 18:49.804
Do you mind moving
for one second Frank? / Yeap.

18:53.128 --> 18:56.068
The shooter must have had
a backstage pass.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.576
Security was pretty tight.
How did he get a gun in?

18:58.576 --> 19:02.300
I don't know but
this had to be his position.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.802
Calleigh,

19:10.802 --> 19:13.275
let's print all these panels.
He may have touched one of them.

19:13.275 --> 19:15.339
I'll print every inch.

19:15.339 --> 19:17.496
Okay.

19:17.919 --> 19:21.491
Frank, do me a favor.
Go back to Billy's position.

19:23.986 --> 19:30.077
Now, 10large was bent down
when he got shot, right?

19:30.077 --> 19:32.522
So how did Billy get shot?

19:32.522 --> 19:35.747
You're right. He would have
been shot in the leg if at all.

19:35.747 --> 19:38.860
Right, because the shooter
had a clear shot of 10Large.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.893
Why would he hit Billy?

19:54.179 --> 19:56.197
Because he was aiming at Billy.

19:56.197 --> 19:57.860
The rapper wasn't the target.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.894
Right. The bodyguard was.

20:10.413 --> 20:12.081
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Alexx.

20:12.081 --> 20:13.967
No ID on the victim.

20:13.967 --> 20:18.996
But based on liver temp and vitreous fluid
I put time of death at approximately 9 AM.

20:18.996 --> 20:21.414
There was no blood flow
around impalement wound.

20:21.414 --> 20:23.504
But there was around
the other ones,

20:23.504 --> 20:27.506
which is inconsistent with
her body position in the tree.

20:27.506 --> 20:29.319
We all know blood
doesn't flow up.

20:29.319 --> 20:33.139
She was dead before
she ejected from the car.

20:33.139 --> 20:36.699
4 inch pucture wounds,
fatal blow hit the subclavian artery

20:36.699 --> 20:40.270
with lots of soft tissue damage,
death from exsanguination.

20:40.270 --> 20:41.829
Okay, so we're not
talking about a knife.

20:41.829 --> 20:45.309
No, atypical weapon.
Entry wounds appear to be curved.

20:45.309 --> 20:47.300
Haven't find anything at the scene.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.687
Well, I found some tissue
under her finger nails.

20:49.687 --> 20:51.485
I already send samples to DNA.

20:51.485 --> 20:53.104
That's great, thanks Alexx.

20:53.104 --> 20:54.800
You're welcome, baby.

20:55.175 --> 20:56.886
So, you don't remember anything?

20:56.886 --> 20:59.150
I remember jogging this morning,

20:59.150 --> 21:00.774
I came home,

21:00.774 --> 21:02.794
and then they told me

21:02.794 --> 21:05.248
I was in a car accident.

21:05.547 --> 21:07.413
A woman was killed.

21:07.413 --> 21:09.619
Are you saying I hit someone?

21:09.619 --> 21:12.556
Not hit, she was killed.

21:14.397 --> 21:17.136
And you recognize her?

21:17.136 --> 21:19.034
It's Nicole.

21:19.034 --> 21:22.098
- But I...
- How do you know her?

21:22.260 --> 21:23.723
She's my girl friend.

21:23.723 --> 21:25.313
How long have you
two been friends?

21:25.313 --> 21:27.672
She's my girl friend,
she just moved in with me.

21:27.672 --> 21:29.250
I don't...

21:29.250 --> 21:32.151
Nicole was found
at the scene of the accident.

21:32.151 --> 21:33.778
She was stabbed.

21:33.778 --> 21:35.363
Stabbed?

21:35.363 --> 21:37.931
Blood was found on the car and...

21:38.288 --> 21:41.680
your DNA was found
under her fingernails.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.901
So, I guess you had a fight?

21:49.506 --> 21:52.192
Look, I can't remember
anything before my accident.

21:52.192 --> 21:53.529
But I know me,

21:53.529 --> 21:55.188
and I know her.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.702
I'm telling you, I couldn't...

21:56.702 --> 21:58.951
I couldn't have done that.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.232
I would never do that to Nicole.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.383
Please...

22:02.383 --> 22:05.789
We'll go to your apartment
and see what we can do.

22:20.801 --> 22:23.607
Well, there's definite
signs of struggle.

22:24.835 --> 22:26.577
Amnesia, huh?

22:26.577 --> 22:28.361
It's pretty convinient.

22:28.361 --> 22:30.013
Maybe she's got a little uh...

22:30.013 --> 22:33.331
evil twin we can interrogate too.

22:33.595 --> 22:36.768
Look, she has a concussion, okay?
Memory loss is common.

22:36.768 --> 22:40.210
I bet it'll all comes back to her
once she gets an attorney.

22:48.831 --> 22:51.105
I've got a cork screw.

22:52.220 --> 22:56.824
Alexx said the puncture wounds
were curved, so that's consistent.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.055
This bottle.

23:09.065 --> 23:12.564
Prints tell me that whoever
grabbed it used it as a weapon.

23:16.115 --> 23:18.814
All right, so that gives us
two weapons of opportunity?

23:18.814 --> 23:22.031
I'm thinking maybe the
bottle started the fight,

23:22.031 --> 23:24.419
and the cork screw ended it.

23:33.313 --> 23:37.080
Well, if the evidence is equivocal,
we gotta go with the only witness.

23:37.384 --> 23:39.592
Yeah, the only one's dead,

23:39.592 --> 23:41.542
that helps.

23:41.542 --> 23:42.829
What do you think, she's lying?

23:42.829 --> 23:45.892
Yeah, you would too if you
didn't think she was so hot.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.698
Now check this out.

23:47.698 --> 23:49.776
I've got drag marks,

23:49.776 --> 23:51.991
shoes are small, narrow

23:51.991 --> 23:54.409
like a woman's.

23:56.225 --> 23:59.299
Leading out to the, uh...

23:59.393 --> 24:02.126
to the garage.

24:08.723 --> 24:11.152
If Veronica's so innocent,

24:11.282 --> 24:13.987
why did she try
to dump the body?

24:24.011 --> 24:26.113
Hey doc. / Gentlemen.

24:26.113 --> 24:28.706
Alexx, have you finished
the bodyguard?

24:28.706 --> 24:30.281
Just.

24:30.281 --> 24:33.581
Did you need to see him? / Only
if you have something to show me.

24:33.581 --> 24:37.005
Well, besides the holes
in his torso, not much.

24:37.005 --> 24:38.847
Just a small cut over his eye.

24:38.847 --> 24:41.653
Recent? / No, a couple
of days old, at least.

24:41.653 --> 24:44.065
- Preview of coming attractions?
- Maybe.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.207
Alexx, what about his clothes?

24:46.207 --> 24:48.542
Haven't had a chance
to send them to trace.

24:48.542 --> 24:49.857
Tough day?

24:49.857 --> 24:51.661
You don't know tough.

24:51.661 --> 24:54.360
It's about time one of them
talked back to you.

24:54.969 --> 24:56.442
Nice watch.

24:56.442 --> 24:58.422
Those diamonds?

24:58.422 --> 24:59.947
The question is,

24:59.947 --> 25:02.407
what is our bodyguard doing with it?

25:02.407 --> 25:04.598
Let's go talk to his employer.

25:05.812 --> 25:08.408
So covering 10Large was
a new assignment for Billy?

25:08.408 --> 25:11.146
Mm, just put him on
today's of concert.

25:11.146 --> 25:13.966
- Who did he covered before?
- I can't tell you that.

25:13.966 --> 25:15.659
It's privileged
client information.

25:15.659 --> 25:19.150
Mr. Bingham, did you move
Billy because he was stealing?

25:19.150 --> 25:23.130
We don't employ
thieves here, lieutenant.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.082
So why the change in
the assignment?

25:26.082 --> 25:29.043
This is a security company.

25:29.043 --> 25:32.578
What I don't know, I don't ask.
And what I do know, I don't tell.

25:32.578 --> 25:35.747
We found two types
of DNA on Billy's watch,

25:35.747 --> 25:37.730
one was Billy's,

25:37.730 --> 25:39.725
and one was a mystery.

25:39.725 --> 25:41.055
You have your choice here Rick,

25:41.055 --> 25:43.853
we can go to every one
of your privileged clients,

25:43.853 --> 25:46.233
stick a swab in their mouth,
and tell them you sent us.

25:46.233 --> 25:48.843
Or you can assist us.

25:48.843 --> 25:51.515
So it's up to you.

25:57.308 --> 25:59.568
- Dan Dacoda.
- The sports commentator?

25:59.568 --> 26:00.828
Correct.

26:00.828 --> 26:02.304
Thank you.

26:04.448 --> 26:05.717
I know about Billy, yeah.

26:05.717 --> 26:07.004
I heard about that.

26:07.004 --> 26:08.415
Horrible.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.831
That's why I won't let
my kids listen to rap.

26:11.256 --> 26:14.265
We're thinking that Billy may have
been the target of the shooting.

26:14.265 --> 26:15.969
You're kidding. / No.

26:15.969 --> 26:19.692
And I guess I was hoping that you might
be able to tell me something about that.

26:19.692 --> 26:20.869
I wish I could.

26:20.869 --> 26:23.040
I was also wondering

26:23.040 --> 26:25.491
where Billy might have gotten that.

26:25.491 --> 26:26.769
I gave it to him.

26:26.769 --> 26:28.721
It's one of my endorsements,
I get a new one every year.

26:28.721 --> 26:32.997
- Yeah, he didn't steal it from you?
- No, hell no.

26:33.213 --> 26:35.416
Why did you move him?

26:35.416 --> 26:39.548
We had disagreement. / The Disagreement
produced that bruise on your face?

26:40.495 --> 26:42.675
Yeah, that's why I fired him.

26:42.675 --> 26:45.196
Where did the fight take place?

26:45.196 --> 26:48.264
- Right up front.
- All right, you wanna show me?

26:48.264 --> 26:49.807
Sure.

26:49.807 --> 26:51.301
Tell me what happened.

26:51.301 --> 26:52.807
Billy took the car
the other night,

26:52.807 --> 26:55.219
came home wasted
acting like an idiot,

27:00.011 --> 27:02.994
You're my bodyguard,
you're not supposed to take the car.

27:09.115 --> 27:12.134
I'm not going to tolerate that,
not around my kids,

27:12.890 --> 27:14.746
It's understandable.

27:14.746 --> 27:16.109
And you...

27:16.109 --> 27:18.088
even had an accident recently.

27:18.088 --> 27:20.071
No, I...

27:21.442 --> 27:23.324
Ah, great.

27:23.324 --> 27:25.317
Billy probably ran it off on a curve.

27:25.317 --> 27:28.822
Yeah, but that wouldn't
explain this blood.

27:28.822 --> 27:31.911
Damn,
I hope he didn't hurt anybody?

27:35.115 --> 27:37.034
Do you know what that is?

27:37.034 --> 27:40.657
That is brain matter.

27:41.808 --> 27:43.654
What does that mean?

27:43.654 --> 27:46.366
That means somebody's dead.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.640
Hi. / What's up.

27:52.784 --> 27:55.198
Is the murder weapon talking to you?

27:55.198 --> 27:56.941
I wish.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.432
Uhm... just smudges on the handle.

27:59.432 --> 28:01.189
Nothing workable.

28:01.189 --> 28:05.872
And Nicole's blood on the end.
Prints on this one are Nicole's too.

28:06.049 --> 28:08.179
Maybe Veronica was
defending herself.

28:08.179 --> 28:10.324
Or the other way round.

28:10.324 --> 28:12.368
Hit the lights, will you?

28:21.717 --> 28:25.450
Got some blood here,
may be that'll answer it for us.

28:36.278 --> 28:38.497
Hey.

28:38.497 --> 28:40.458
There's something right there.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.317
Yeah, what do you think it is?

28:42.317 --> 28:45.165
There's one way to find out.

29:03.194 --> 29:04.729
It's got a rough surface,

29:04.729 --> 29:07.044
it's cracked.

29:08.521 --> 29:11.231
It's green.

29:11.390 --> 29:13.200
Two pattern holes.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.645
Let's see what it's made of.

29:19.093 --> 29:22.174
Primary component is
polyvinyl chloride.

29:22.174 --> 29:24.185
PVC isn't plastic.

29:24.185 --> 29:29.044
Thermo-plastic in this case printing
on clothing, it's part of the decal.

29:29.044 --> 29:32.887
Maybe it flaked off like the number on
an old baseball jersey or something?

29:32.887 --> 29:37.247
Pattern holes could be from mesh.
Veronica's shirt got a logo on it?

29:37.379 --> 29:39.384
Follow me.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.627
Yup, mesh T-shirt.

29:47.448 --> 29:49.923
Logo's the same color
and consistency.

29:49.923 --> 29:52.270
South Beach Training club.

29:52.270 --> 29:53.701
Paramedics hacked through it.

29:53.701 --> 29:55.845
We're not gonna be able to
piece the logo back together.

29:55.845 --> 29:59.013
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
the shirt can't help us.

30:03.251 --> 30:06.976
We found Nicole's prints
on a wine bottle in your condo.

30:06.976 --> 30:09.473
She used it as a weapon.

30:09.607 --> 30:11.606
It's possible
she used it on you.

30:11.606 --> 30:14.812
Remember any of it? / No.
Nicole would never attack me.

30:14.812 --> 30:17.365
Well, you work at the
South Beach Training club

30:17.365 --> 30:21.077
and our evidence tells us that whoever
was in the fight with her was injured,

30:21.077 --> 30:23.121
wearing one of their T-shirts.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.620
Where?

30:24.620 --> 30:25.783
Upper...

30:25.783 --> 30:28.045
left chest area.

30:31.417 --> 30:32.857
See?

30:32.857 --> 30:35.680
I told you.
She'd never hurt me.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.980
Who else had access
to these T-shirts?

30:37.980 --> 30:39.442
Just emplyees.

30:39.442 --> 30:43.790
Anyone at work you can think of, anybody
that may have a grudge against you?

30:47.210 --> 30:49.120
There is one person.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.471
My ex-boyfriend.

30:51.641 --> 30:56.087
According to your boss, you weren't
working this morning from 8 to 10.

30:56.217 --> 30:57.492
So, where were you?

30:57.492 --> 30:59.727
I didn't have any
clients scheduled,

30:59.727 --> 31:02.394
I went to the beach.

31:03.460 --> 31:04.894
Is this your shirt?

31:04.894 --> 31:07.844
Yeah. / It's clean,
you just washed it.

31:07.844 --> 31:09.568
I sweat a lot,

31:09.568 --> 31:11.299
part of the job.

31:11.299 --> 31:13.478
Well, do you mind if we keep it?

31:14.536 --> 31:16.180
Anything to help.

31:16.180 --> 31:20.190
If you wanna help out so much, why don't
you show us that wound under your shirt.

31:20.307 --> 31:23.062
Unbutton my shirt for you?

31:23.814 --> 31:26.555
It's not that kind of gym.

31:28.683 --> 31:30.845
We're done here.

31:39.089 --> 31:41.335
You heard him.

31:41.780 --> 31:44.178
He said he sweats a lot.

32:00.992 --> 32:03.181
I never thought
you'd get these in here.

32:03.181 --> 32:04.760
You doubted me,

32:04.760 --> 32:08.642
where's the love? / The panels
from club are pretty big.

32:08.642 --> 32:10.401
Okay, I had to cut them.

32:10.401 --> 32:15.801
How's it coming? / Got about twenty
workable latents and hundreds of smudges.

32:19.937 --> 32:21.965
- Still going though.
- Can I help?

32:21.965 --> 32:24.841
- You can run this part on AFIS.
- You got it.

32:24.841 --> 32:26.378
Great.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.709
Night shift CSI got a hit and
run fatality on Thursday.

32:30.709 --> 32:33.362
A kid changing a tire
on Old Cutler road.

32:33.362 --> 32:35.354
That's less than 2 miles from
Dacoda's house.

32:35.354 --> 32:39.364
- Which substantiates the story.
- Trevor Lieves, 18 years old.

32:39.364 --> 32:41.752
- Tell me about it Frank.
- Well, he went to Miami U,

32:41.752 --> 32:44.402
- he's from Wisconsin.
- So what do we have left,

32:44.402 --> 32:47.633
we have a bodyguard
who steals his boss's car,

32:47.633 --> 32:50.922
then kills a teenage kid.

32:57.852 --> 32:59.907
Security company's not
gonna be too happy about that.

32:59.907 --> 33:02.095
Not good for business.

33:44.795 --> 33:46.833
Is this really necessary?

33:46.833 --> 33:48.751
I already gave you my shirt.

33:48.751 --> 33:54.144
Your blood was found on a broken
wine bottle in Veronica Grant's condo.

33:54.144 --> 33:57.637
Your DNA matches it.

33:58.092 --> 33:59.723
How can you match that to me?

33:59.723 --> 34:01.780
Threw in that towel at the club.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.820
Helped us get a warrant.

34:03.820 --> 34:06.532
You tried to wash your shirt,
get the blood off,

34:06.532 --> 34:10.937
but unfortunately you left
a little tiny piece on the bottle.

34:10.937 --> 34:13.649
That's right, we know you were there,
we just want to know why.

34:13.649 --> 34:15.909
Were you still angry about
your break up with Veronica?

34:15.909 --> 34:17.436
No.

34:17.436 --> 34:20.054
She didn't do it for me.

34:21.114 --> 34:24.081
Apparently you didn't
do it for her either.

34:24.226 --> 34:25.875
She left you for a woman.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.938
Yeah, she should have told me that.

34:27.938 --> 34:29.735
Three of us could've had some fun.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.454
She didn't have to
tell you anything.

34:31.454 --> 34:33.752
You found out for yourself.

34:35.790 --> 34:37.534
- May I help you?
- Where's Veronica?

34:37.534 --> 34:39.534
Get out, get out.

34:39.534 --> 34:43.735
It must have been a shock when you
found your girl friend left you for a woman.

34:43.735 --> 34:46.661
And I guess it wasn't long
before things got out of hand.

34:46.661 --> 34:47.973
I'm calling the police.

34:47.973 --> 34:50.054
Get out of my face.

34:50.366 --> 34:51.806
Sleeping with her?

34:51.806 --> 34:53.250
Have fun?

34:53.250 --> 34:56.268
She got back up
and you really fought.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.874
You took my girl and
I'll see how tough you are.

35:00.339 --> 35:02.497
Unfortunately you had snag,

35:02.497 --> 35:04.796
literally.

35:13.098 --> 35:15.947
Shirt.

35:16.198 --> 35:18.900
Unbutton it.

35:22.261 --> 35:25.440
We all know what happened next.

35:26.934 --> 35:28.698
Come here.

35:38.097 --> 35:40.853
I think I want a lawyer.

35:50.001 --> 35:52.524
Veronica.

35:52.892 --> 35:55.119
When they called me
they told me I can get uh...

35:55.119 --> 35:58.570
- some of Nicole's things so...
- Absolutely.

36:00.996 --> 36:03.542
Are you holding up?

36:04.015 --> 36:07.753
I hope they keep him
locked up forever, you know?

36:11.276 --> 36:13.051
I just wanted you to know uh...

36:13.051 --> 36:15.477
what really happened.

36:17.729 --> 36:21.160
Nicole was still alive
when you came home.

36:22.457 --> 36:23.960
Nicole?

36:23.960 --> 36:26.162
Oh my god!

36:26.299 --> 36:28.760
Nicole, are you okay?

36:28.760 --> 36:30.714
She scratched you out
of animal instinct.

36:30.714 --> 36:32.866
She was just fighting to survive.

36:32.866 --> 36:35.759
You knew you had to
get her to hospital.

36:37.500 --> 36:42.913
But you didn't realize it that she had
already died in your front seat.

36:45.281 --> 36:48.736
You tried to save her.

36:51.593 --> 36:55.733
All I wanted was to
remember what happened.

36:55.733 --> 36:58.747
But you know what?

36:59.426 --> 37:01.968
I hope I never do.

37:15.601 --> 37:18.620
47 partials, 14 jewcy ones,

37:18.620 --> 37:20.172
and not one hit.

37:20.172 --> 37:21.544
Yet.

37:21.544 --> 37:26.430
You see, this is why I like bullets
because there is no waiting.

37:33.469 --> 37:35.720
Okay, that's twice in one day.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.415
I hope that teaches you
not to doubt the man.

37:38.415 --> 37:41.434
Does make me happy, Joseph.

37:42.484 --> 37:46.452
My sincerest apologies to the man.

37:48.607 --> 37:50.652
I've got a hit off the panel.

37:50.652 --> 37:55.664
Fugitive wanted in 6 states,
sexual assault and murder.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.158
I know this face.

37:58.158 --> 38:00.952
With a record like that,
I don't know how he got back stage.

38:00.952 --> 38:02.944
I do.

38:10.732 --> 38:12.484
Hello, gentlemen.

38:12.484 --> 38:14.009
Is there a problem?

38:14.009 --> 38:15.540
You screwed up Bingham.

38:15.540 --> 38:19.179
You employed convicted felons,
Mr. Bingham, to protect your clients

38:19.179 --> 38:21.061
and that is a problem.

38:21.061 --> 38:23.300
I, I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.137
This is what we're talking about.

38:27.869 --> 38:30.534
- That's Craig Yarnell.
- His real name is Craig Waters,

38:30.534 --> 38:34.632
He's wanted in 6 states
for murder and sexual assault.

38:34.632 --> 38:38.079
So, where is he?

38:39.202 --> 38:42.087
Working for Dan Dacoda.

38:46.630 --> 38:48.624
Careful, Lindsey.

38:48.624 --> 38:50.711
Waters!

38:51.204 --> 38:53.908
Dumbass, gets them everytime.

38:53.908 --> 38:56.977
My name's Yarnell. / Yarnell died
two years ago in Alabama.

38:56.977 --> 38:59.776
You took his identity.

39:04.035 --> 39:06.546
That's for the job.

39:08.175 --> 39:11.478
What else you got
in there, Mr. Waters?

39:15.405 --> 39:17.945
Here go.45

39:29.521 --> 39:33.055
Craig, finger prints
are like old habits.

39:33.055 --> 39:34.799
They die hard.

39:34.799 --> 39:37.079
Seems like a payed
gig to me Mr. Waters.

39:37.079 --> 39:39.495
So who hired you?

39:39.874 --> 39:42.006
Let's go back to the security
company lay him on Bingham.

39:42.006 --> 39:45.224
I've got a better idea.
I'm more interested

39:45.224 --> 39:48.110
in why we keep coming back here.

39:48.110 --> 39:51.792
Let's take another
look at Dan's navigator.

39:51.792 --> 39:53.991
So we can prove
the navigator hit the boy,

39:53.991 --> 39:57.356
- but not who's driving.
- That's what this is for.

39:57.356 --> 40:00.616
No way, an aftermarket
safety system?

40:01.383 --> 40:03.886
I got it from Dan's navigator.

40:03.886 --> 40:06.947
Like the black box in a airplane.

40:07.131 --> 40:08.875
So cool.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.399
So, Big Brother.

40:10.399 --> 40:12.203
Do we hook it up?

40:13.961 --> 40:15.828
The system has

40:15.828 --> 40:18.414
45 impact sensors.

40:18.725 --> 40:22.830
Okay, did one of the
monitors impact thusday night?

40:23.925 --> 40:25.474
Yup.

40:25.474 --> 40:27.698
Come on.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.516
Front sensor, passenger side.

40:30.516 --> 40:33.036
What about a time and place?

40:33.172 --> 40:35.653
12:10 AM, Old Cutler road.

40:35.653 --> 40:37.354
- It's where Trevor was hit.
- That's right,

40:37.354 --> 40:41.131
so when the system is tripped,
the driver is notified, right?

40:41.131 --> 40:43.584
Yeah, but uh..
it's not recorded here.

40:43.584 --> 40:45.206
I'd have to call the company.

40:45.206 --> 40:46.910
Let's do that.

40:51.943 --> 40:55.596
Trevor Lieves, 18 years old.

40:55.596 --> 40:56.828
He may seem familiar.

40:56.828 --> 41:00.305
You split his head open
with the bumper of your car.

41:00.305 --> 41:01.790
This is ridiculous.

41:01.790 --> 41:04.448
My client already told you
he was home Thursday night.

41:04.448 --> 41:07.877
Which would mean
Billy stole his car, correct?

41:07.877 --> 41:09.141
Correct.

41:09.141 --> 41:12.983
And unless you can
prove otherwise, we're done here.

41:13.184 --> 41:17.583
Behind door number two,

41:17.583 --> 41:19.742
we have...

41:19.742 --> 41:21.463
Mr. Dacoda?

41:21.463 --> 41:24.326
Yeah? / This is
Cam from Infarmer Guard

41:24.326 --> 41:27.187
our system registers that your
accident threshold has been met.

41:27.187 --> 41:29.074
Are you okay?

41:29.074 --> 41:31.559
Ah, shoot.

41:31.772 --> 41:35.431
I must've run upon
a curve or something.

41:35.431 --> 41:38.214
It's nothing, I'm fine.

41:38.379 --> 41:40.410
That't you on the tape, Dan.

41:40.410 --> 41:43.943
And that means you were driving,
and Billy wasn't.

41:43.943 --> 41:47.180
And you were drunk
out of your mind.

41:47.180 --> 41:49.038
I told you,

41:49.038 --> 41:54.958
I don't drink. / It seems
a tad incosistent with the tape.

42:08.581 --> 42:11.162
Mr. Dacoda?

42:11.316 --> 42:13.535
Yeah?

42:18.347 --> 42:21.375
A wasted commentator,
ploughs down an 18-year old.

42:21.375 --> 42:23.952
That's an ugly blot
on a pretty career, huh?

42:23.952 --> 42:28.284
So Billy wanted to blow
the whistle on you, right?

42:32.274 --> 42:34.193
Wow, what happened?
where were you?

42:34.193 --> 42:35.750
Is that blood?

42:35.750 --> 42:38.094
Huh, Dan?

42:38.429 --> 42:40.282
- It's nothing.
- Hey, hey.

42:40.282 --> 42:42.739
We need to call the police
at least an ambulance.

42:42.739 --> 42:45.480
- No, no, no, Billy.
- You're my bodyguard.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.434
You're not gonna say
a word, okay? Promise me.

42:47.434 --> 42:49.721
I can't do that man.

42:49.721 --> 42:52.789
No, you got 48 hours
to do the right thing.

42:56.830 --> 43:00.293
And you had him killed.

43:00.293 --> 43:04.186
I was out of town calling a pre-season
game the day Billy was shot.

43:04.186 --> 43:07.840
You hired Craig Waters
to protect you and your family.

43:08.549 --> 43:10.464
And then you hired him to kill Billy.

43:10.464 --> 43:12.869
You know it's too bad, Dan.

43:12.869 --> 43:14.943
that you can't get him

43:14.943 --> 43:17.422
to do your time.
