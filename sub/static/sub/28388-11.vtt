00:02.273 --> 00:04.576
I know how hard you've
been working lately,

00:04.652 --> 00:06.738
so I figured you
could use a break.

00:08.105 --> 00:10.136
Trixie, this looks amazing!

00:10.224 --> 00:12.506
But my job doesn't
really seem like work.

00:14.168 --> 00:15.447
Ooh! Speaking of...

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:27.342 --> 00:29.410
Sure, being counselor
for the students

00:29.498 --> 00:31.861
at Twilight's School of
Friendship is demanding,

00:31.949 --> 00:33.753
but... Oh, one sec.

00:39.767 --> 00:42.064
What was I saying? Oh, right.

00:42.152 --> 00:44.119
Being able to use
the experiences

00:44.207 --> 00:46.558
of my checkered past
to help young students

00:46.646 --> 00:51.254
feels pretty great.
Oooh! Yum! Mm. Thanks.

00:52.208 --> 00:54.500
Of course, I feel
nothing but admiration

00:54.588 --> 00:57.637
for the work you do, but it
is a little all-consuming

00:57.725 --> 00:59.873
and I miss spending
time with you.

00:59.961 --> 01:01.449
What are you
talking about?

01:01.537 --> 01:03.652
We're spending
time right now.

01:03.752 --> 01:04.894
Well...

01:07.521 --> 01:08.576
Hold that thought.

01:09.906 --> 01:10.996
Grrr!

01:13.357 --> 01:15.925
Sorry. I cast a spell
on the door to my office

01:16.013 --> 01:18.488
so this bracelet goes off
whenever there's a knock.

01:18.576 --> 01:21.754
Yona is having the worst
time with her braids lately.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.050
Anyway, you were saying?

02:10.770 --> 02:13.324
I totally respect my
younger cousins' decisions

02:13.412 --> 02:14.435
to stay seaponies,

02:14.523 --> 02:16.410
but they've never
been on dry land.

02:16.505 --> 02:18.697
Preparing for a visit with
them is almost as much work

02:18.785 --> 02:20.740
as the research assignment
Headmare Twilight gave me

02:20.827 --> 02:23.183
on Hazardous Fauna of
the Everfree Forest!

02:23.292 --> 02:25.629
How would you describe
a shower to creatures

02:25.717 --> 02:26.770
who live in water?

02:26.858 --> 02:28.699
So far, I've got
warm and steamy.

02:28.787 --> 02:30.735
Actually, steam
has water in it.

02:30.823 --> 02:33.424
Silverstream, there
are a lot of students

02:33.512 --> 02:34.894
who want to see me today.

02:34.982 --> 02:36.830
I just need a few
shower adjectives

02:36.918 --> 02:38.769
that don't rely
on the wet part.

02:38.857 --> 02:43.141
Well, there's
clean, relaxing, um...

02:43.229 --> 02:47.121
Relaxing? I don't know.
A nap's relaxing too.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.738
Warm and clean are OK.

02:49.847 --> 02:51.761
Wow. I have to give
this some more thought.

02:51.979 --> 02:56.605
Oh. OK. Well, I'm here to
help. My door's always open.

02:57.684 --> 02:59.855
Except for today, of course.

03:02.497 --> 03:04.197
If we leave now, we
can finish everything

03:04.285 --> 03:05.222
before sundown.

03:05.310 --> 03:09.347
Trixie, I can't leave.
It's almost Spring Break.

03:10.402 --> 03:12.607
Twilight and the others
have already left

03:12.695 --> 03:14.582
to celebrate the Spring
Solstice in Canterlot

03:14.670 --> 03:16.859
and I have to help the
students with any issues

03:16.947 --> 03:18.795
before they head
home for the holiday.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.830
I know you're busy, but I
hope you haven't forgotten

03:25.918 --> 03:28.003
about the Spring Sols-tastic.

03:30.242 --> 03:32.738
The party Maud and
Mudbriar are throwing?

03:34.125 --> 03:36.105
Sunburst is coming to town?

03:37.652 --> 03:40.941
You and I promised
to make the cake?

03:41.185 --> 03:44.713
PFFFT! How could I possibly
forget about that?

03:55.345 --> 03:57.503
Nopony is saying your
job isn't important,

03:57.591 --> 04:00.540
but plans you make with your
friends are important too.

04:00.759 --> 04:04.576
I know. I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have forgotten.

04:04.664 --> 04:07.214
Obviously, I need to be
available to my students,

04:07.302 --> 04:09.550
but that doesn't
mean I can't help

04:09.638 --> 04:11.219
with all the things
we have to do.

04:11.307 --> 04:12.472
Good.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.058
Great.

04:14.349 --> 04:19.701
So what are all the
things we have to do?

04:19.937 --> 04:22.052
Maud needs streamers
for the decorations.

04:22.140 --> 04:25.121
Sunburst wants us to pick up
a genuine, pre-Equestrian,

04:25.209 --> 04:27.527
Spring Solstice chafing
dish from the antique shop.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.176
Of course he does.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.464
Mudbriar wants a "bouquet
of flowering sticks,"

04:31.552 --> 04:32.387
whatever that means.

04:32.475 --> 04:34.910
And I thought we were both
looking forward to Mrs. Cake

04:34.998 --> 04:36.114
teaching us the secret recipe

04:36.201 --> 04:38.012
to her famous Spring
Solstice cake.

04:38.207 --> 04:40.684
Oh, I totally am.

04:41.367 --> 04:45.684
But we could just buy
a cake from her, right?

04:45.983 --> 04:50.723
We could, but then we'd
miss out on baking together.

04:50.925 --> 04:53.504
Plus the time I spent
flattering and convincing

04:53.592 --> 04:56.374
and begging her to share the
recipe would be for nothing,

04:56.524 --> 04:59.474
and we promised to make
a cake, not buy a cake

04:59.562 --> 05:02.863
and the great and powerful
Trixie keeps her promises!

05:03.342 --> 05:07.293
OK. Why don't we just
split up these jobs?

05:07.381 --> 05:09.613
I'll get the streamers
and the chafing dish.

05:09.701 --> 05:12.851
You... get
started on those sticks

05:12.939 --> 05:14.363
and I'll be right back.

05:18.637 --> 05:21.574
You know, why don't I
just hang onto this?

05:21.669 --> 05:23.816
Wouldn't want to forget
the things I just said

05:23.910 --> 05:24.973
I'd take care of...

05:25.061 --> 05:27.918
because I am totally going
to take care of them.

05:32.691 --> 05:34.480
Could it be plum blossom?

05:34.599 --> 05:35.691
I have no idea. Wha!

05:36.998 --> 05:39.838
Whoops! Sorry Rose,
but I need a bouquet

05:39.926 --> 05:41.668
of flowering sticks, STAT!

05:41.756 --> 05:44.418
I thought I was getting
the flowering sticks.

05:45.030 --> 05:47.754
Uh, I'm still not exactly
sure what they are.

05:47.842 --> 05:48.889
No one is!

05:49.227 --> 05:50.379
Right. Got it.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.535
You get the sticks;
I'll get the streamers...

05:53.709 --> 05:55.642
Right after I take
care of what I am sure

05:55.843 --> 05:58.129
is an even smaller student
problem than the last one.

05:58.217 --> 05:59.730
Ha ha.

06:07.890 --> 06:10.379
I think I have the shower
thing under control,

06:10.467 --> 06:12.863
but I can't figure out
how to describe a towel.

06:18.732 --> 06:20.723
Now Smolder,
I understand the school

06:20.811 --> 06:22.419
can be a bit drafty,
but that doesn't mean

06:22.506 --> 06:24.207
you can breathe fire
anywhere you want.

06:28.218 --> 06:30.711
What do you mean Trixie already
picked up Sunburst's genuine,

06:30.814 --> 06:32.294
pre-Equestrian,
Equine-ox chafing dish?

06:32.381 --> 06:36.158
That was my job...
I think. Wait. Was it?

06:43.517 --> 06:46.299
Ocellus, it's perfectly
normal for a changeling

06:46.387 --> 06:48.191
to struggle with
identity issues, but...

06:48.279 --> 06:50.738
Counselor Starlight?
When you're done,

06:50.826 --> 06:53.270
I need some synonyms
for the word "dry."

06:53.358 --> 06:55.707
Or really just help
explaining the concept.

06:58.428 --> 07:01.520
Oh, wait! Mrs. Cake!
You can't close.

07:01.608 --> 07:03.154
Trixie and I need
to learn the recipe

07:03.242 --> 07:04.371
for your Equine-ox cake.

07:04.536 --> 07:07.525
Oh, it's fine, dear.
Trixie was already here.

07:07.613 --> 07:10.213
I told her everything
she needs to know.

07:10.301 --> 07:14.486
What? NO! The Great
and Powerful Trixie

07:14.574 --> 07:15.961
might keep her promises,

07:16.048 --> 07:19.364
but the busy and distracted
Starlight sure doesn't.

07:19.504 --> 07:21.233
I promised to help her today

07:21.320 --> 07:23.189
and I haven't done
a single thing!

07:24.389 --> 07:26.271
Oh, that does
sound hard, dear,

07:26.358 --> 07:28.434
and I'm not sure quite
how to tell you this,

07:28.522 --> 07:30.303
but your hoof
is glowing.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.504
Of course it is.

07:39.934 --> 07:41.920
Trixie? What are
you doing here?

07:42.113 --> 07:44.589
It's the one place I
knew I could find you.

07:44.770 --> 07:48.330
I am so sorry about
today. I'm just so...

07:48.418 --> 07:49.560
Busy. I know.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.041
Obviously, your students
are more important

07:52.129 --> 07:53.605
than your friends.

07:53.863 --> 07:54.871
That's not...

07:56.197 --> 07:57.864
Starlight, do you have a minute?

07:59.237 --> 08:01.772
Actually,
Silverstream, I don't.

08:01.941 --> 08:04.377
Besides, I need to lock up
the school for the holiday

08:04.465 --> 08:06.611
and it's time you
caught the train home.

08:06.722 --> 08:09.754
I'm sure a smart and
capable student like you

08:09.863 --> 08:12.884
can figure out the solution to
any problem over the break,

08:13.059 --> 08:16.980
but for now, the counselor's
office is closed.

08:20.936 --> 08:23.012
I have a cake to bake.

08:30.027 --> 08:34.754
Ow! Is this cake
supposed to be so sharp?

08:36.428 --> 08:39.746
I mean, it looks
really... interesting.

08:40.198 --> 08:42.580
Technically,
it's not symmetrical

08:42.668 --> 08:44.527
or aesthetically pleasing.

08:45.642 --> 08:47.518
Maybe it's not the best cake,

08:47.606 --> 08:50.622
but we made it together
and that's what counts.

08:50.777 --> 08:53.801
I'm glad you brought
it, and everything else.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.995
I'm very excited.

08:57.191 --> 09:00.676
This is going to be the
most perfect party ever.

09:00.986 --> 09:04.025
And with all of your students
home for the holiday,

09:04.113 --> 09:06.283
I won't have to worry
about you being summoned

09:06.371 --> 09:08.512
to your office in
the middle of it.

09:09.332 --> 09:11.743
Nothing is going to take
me away from this party.

09:11.941 --> 09:15.316
Hello? Starlight? Starlight?

09:17.449 --> 09:20.214
Sorry, this is a
private cavern.

09:20.344 --> 09:23.269
Is Starlight here?
I was told she'd be here.

09:23.620 --> 09:24.756
What's wrong?

09:24.878 --> 09:27.003
I'm Terramar,
Silverstream's brother.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.894
I've been looking
all over for you.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.034
Silverstream is missing.

09:37.784 --> 09:38.816
I don't understand.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.667
Silverstream didn't come home?

09:41.394 --> 09:42.579
I was supposed to meet her

09:42.667 --> 09:43.783
at the Mount Aris train station,

09:43.870 --> 09:45.441
but she never showed up.

09:45.730 --> 09:48.290
It's a long way between
Ponyville and Mount Aris.

09:48.378 --> 09:49.647
She could be anywhere.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.790
Our parents are leading
teams of hippogriffs

09:51.878 --> 09:53.853
and seaponies, searching
the land and sea

09:53.941 --> 09:55.056
between here and our home.

09:55.144 --> 09:56.722
They sent me to
check the school.

09:56.810 --> 09:59.472
But the school's closed.
All the students are gone.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.623
Are you sure?

10:00.711 --> 10:02.769
I know she had a big
project due for Twilight.

10:02.881 --> 10:04.870
Do you think she might
have stayed to finish it?

10:05.011 --> 10:07.056
She never told me
about a project.

10:07.144 --> 10:08.478
Well, to be fair,

10:08.566 --> 10:10.751
you closed your office
the last time she came by.

10:10.839 --> 10:12.277
Really?

10:12.830 --> 10:13.914
What kind of counselor

10:14.002 --> 10:16.417
turns away a student
with a problem?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.933
The kind with too
much on her plate.

10:19.066 --> 10:21.118
Starlight has always
gone out of her way

10:21.206 --> 10:24.749
for her students.
And I mean, ALWAYS.

10:25.011 --> 10:27.394
Except apparently
when it matters.

10:27.581 --> 10:29.053
This is all my fault.

10:29.292 --> 10:30.821
You all go back
to the party.

10:30.909 --> 10:32.667
Terramar and I will
check the school.

10:32.839 --> 10:34.236
We'll find your sister.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.667
I should have known
it couldn't last.

10:39.884 --> 10:42.534
Party perfection is
more of a Pinkie thing.

10:42.753 --> 10:45.102
I wasn't going to
say anything,

10:45.409 --> 10:48.001
but these flowers
are just glued on so,

10:48.089 --> 10:50.816
technically it wasn't
perfect already.

10:52.264 --> 10:54.745
But that's probably
not important.

10:58.394 --> 11:00.730
You check the grounds
and I'll look inside!

11:02.240 --> 11:03.691
Silverstream?

11:06.682 --> 11:08.034
Hello?

11:15.215 --> 11:16.761
Anycreature?

11:19.659 --> 11:20.939
She's not down here.

11:21.135 --> 11:22.973
I don't see her anywhere.

11:23.193 --> 11:24.527
Did you check her room?

11:29.633 --> 11:31.682
Well, she's not here.

11:31.824 --> 11:35.954
No, she isn't. But look at this.

11:36.284 --> 11:37.522
A cockatrice?

11:37.679 --> 11:39.534
Could that be what
her project was on?

11:42.246 --> 11:44.376
You don't think she went
into the Everfree Forest

11:44.464 --> 11:47.113
to find a Cockatrice
by herself, do you?

11:47.214 --> 11:50.222
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out!

11:52.722 --> 11:54.737
Ha ha!

11:59.370 --> 12:01.282
Oh! What are you
all doing here?

12:01.488 --> 12:02.814
We came to help.

12:02.902 --> 12:04.749
We couldn't let you
handle this alone.

12:04.949 --> 12:07.613
Technically,
she wasn't alone...

12:08.276 --> 12:10.284
but we wanted to help anyway.

12:11.291 --> 12:13.290
Thanks, all of you,

12:13.511 --> 12:15.728
but the students are
my responsibility.

12:15.816 --> 12:17.275
I'm the one who
didn't do my job

12:17.363 --> 12:19.167
when it actually
mattered.

12:19.753 --> 12:22.751
I might share a
bit of the blame

12:22.839 --> 12:25.574
for pressuring you into
leaving work early.

12:25.917 --> 12:28.236
But I don't want
to ruin your party.

12:28.324 --> 12:30.339
We can still
have a party.

12:30.885 --> 12:32.378
A search party.

12:32.905 --> 12:34.556
Can we talk about
all this later?

12:34.644 --> 12:37.331
Silverstream might be in
the Everfree Forest alone.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.553
We think she went in to do
research on Cockatrices.

12:41.721 --> 12:44.337
What? The gaze of the
cockatrice is known

12:44.425 --> 12:46.909
to petrify any who
dare to cross its path!

12:47.034 --> 12:50.064
And the reptilian birds
are elusive and solitary.

12:50.152 --> 12:51.996
Where would we even start?

12:52.083 --> 12:54.566
I have a lot of
experience telling ponies

12:54.653 --> 12:56.901
that I have experience with
the dangerous creatures

12:56.988 --> 13:00.152
of Everfree Forest. Follow me!

13:14.773 --> 13:18.306

13:28.787 --> 13:30.191

14:06.424 --> 14:08.181
Weren't we just here?

14:08.269 --> 14:12.259
Trixie, do have any idea
how to find a Cockatrice?

14:12.347 --> 14:15.384
No. But usually when
there's a dangerous creature

14:15.472 --> 14:17.157
in the forest
I don't want to meet,

14:17.245 --> 14:18.495
this is how I meet them.

14:18.583 --> 14:21.065
We might need a
more concrete plan.

14:21.172 --> 14:22.687
Suit yourself.

14:22.831 --> 14:25.384
Um, according to
Silverstream's research,

14:25.472 --> 14:29.126
<i>the Cockatrice prefers rocky
terrain and ample shade.</i>

14:29.214 --> 14:30.847
Rocks and shade.

14:30.935 --> 14:34.786
Hmm, I can't imagine where
we'll find that in a forest.

14:34.953 --> 14:38.016
Actually, rocks aren't the
most hospitable environment

14:38.104 --> 14:39.438
for shade trees.

14:39.526 --> 14:42.040
Technically, pine
trees like Pinus Cembra

14:42.128 --> 14:45.141
or Pinus Sylvestris can
grow from narrow crevasses

14:45.229 --> 14:47.445
or cracks in a
rocky rhizosphere.

14:47.815 --> 14:49.013
You complete me.

14:49.198 --> 14:51.081
There's some pine
trees over there!

15:01.312 --> 15:03.516
I thought you said
they were solitary.

15:03.604 --> 15:06.898
They are! This must be
some kind of migration.

15:06.985 --> 15:09.033
At least there's no
sign of Silverstream.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.735
I can't imagine getting caught

15:10.823 --> 15:11.936
in the middle of that flock.

15:12.023 --> 15:14.005
It's just lucky
we're all over here

15:14.092 --> 15:15.313
and they're all over there.

15:18.677 --> 15:19.624
Technically...

15:19.712 --> 15:21.111
Don't even say it!

15:21.199 --> 15:24.245
Whatever you do,
don't look at them.

15:24.362 --> 15:26.618
Their gaze can
turn you to stone.

15:26.706 --> 15:28.125
So what do we do?

15:29.651 --> 15:31.370
RUN!

Starlight! I'm so sorry.
We have to get out of here.

15:54.363 --> 15:55.520
I know. Hang on.

15:57.902 --> 15:59.415
We can't leave.

15:59.503 --> 16:01.259
Silverstream might
still be in the forest.

16:01.347 --> 16:02.823
Stay here. I'll get the others.

16:02.919 --> 16:04.621
Be careful!

16:08.597 --> 16:10.962
The clucking is coming
from everywhere!

16:11.050 --> 16:14.964
The Great and Powerful
Trixie fears no cluck!

16:20.842 --> 16:22.008
Come on!

16:30.322 --> 16:32.557
Maud, we've got to
get out of here.

16:32.695 --> 16:34.228
I'm not leaving him.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.430
Mudbriar's been turned to stone?

16:42.518 --> 16:45.830
I didn't think I could
love him any more.

16:46.221 --> 16:47.633
We've got to get out of here.

16:47.721 --> 16:49.586
But we haven't
found Silverstream;

16:49.674 --> 16:51.172
we can't leave yet.

16:53.002 --> 16:55.049
We can't stay here. Come on!

17:15.771 --> 17:16.896
This way!

17:29.134 --> 17:30.351
Now what?

17:30.439 --> 17:32.952
Let's hope Silverstream
found a good place to hide.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.577
There could be hundreds more
Cockatrices on the way.

17:35.665 --> 17:37.210
If this really is a migration,

17:37.298 --> 17:39.718
it'll take a full lunar
cycle to complete.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.210
I have to get word
back to our parents

17:42.298 --> 17:43.796
that Silverstream
could be surrounded

17:43.884 --> 17:45.837
by those terrifying birds!

17:46.103 --> 17:48.603
And as handsome as
Mudbriar is now,

17:48.712 --> 17:50.374
we should probably
catch one of them

17:50.462 --> 17:52.314
to turn him back to normal.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.179
UGH! This is all my fault.

17:55.267 --> 17:56.718
I'm never taking time off

17:56.806 --> 17:58.656
from my counseling duties again!

17:58.744 --> 18:00.195
That seems a little extreme.

18:00.283 --> 18:04.554
Really? If I hadn't galloped
off to a holiday celebration,

18:04.642 --> 18:06.562
Silverstream would be
safe with her family

18:06.650 --> 18:08.880
and you'd all be
enjoying Maud's party.

18:09.337 --> 18:11.452
Instead, my student is missing;

18:11.540 --> 18:14.718
we're surrounded by a flock
of petrifying chicken-snakes,

18:14.806 --> 18:18.055
and Maud's boyfriend was
turned into a hunk of rock!

18:18.431 --> 18:20.673
You got the hunk part right.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.960
And to top it off,
we have no idea if Silverstream

18:25.048 --> 18:26.791
even came to Everfree at all,

18:26.879 --> 18:29.486
but I have no idea
where else to look!

18:29.749 --> 18:31.181
Has that always been there?

18:31.281 --> 18:34.397
What? Oh. That's the
students' Treehouse.

18:34.562 --> 18:37.400
Apparently, it grew from
the Tree of Harmony and...

18:38.157 --> 18:39.538
Of course!

18:39.625 --> 18:41.994
That should have been the
first place we looked!

18:54.038 --> 18:56.053
Silverstream, look out!

18:56.242 --> 18:58.057
Counselor Starlight, no!

18:59.464 --> 19:01.072
Wait!

19:07.742 --> 19:11.759
This is Edith.
She's helping me with my project.

19:12.275 --> 19:14.736
I don't understand.

19:15.016 --> 19:17.663
After you encouraged me
to solve my own problem,

19:17.751 --> 19:20.494
I decided to get my
project done before I left.

19:20.822 --> 19:23.081
That way I could really
focus on my family

19:23.169 --> 19:26.322
during my visit.
The school was closed so I came here.

19:26.652 --> 19:28.163
Why didn't you tell anyone?

19:28.251 --> 19:30.055
Mom and Dad are worried sick!

19:30.212 --> 19:32.691
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

19:32.778 --> 19:34.117
Once Edith volunteered to help,

19:34.205 --> 19:36.061
I guess I lost track of time.

19:36.251 --> 19:37.830
Cockatrice's are really friendly

19:37.917 --> 19:39.572
if you know how to
interact with them.

19:43.554 --> 19:45.257
I can't believe you figured out

19:45.345 --> 19:47.605
how to trigger her
nesting response.

19:47.693 --> 19:49.974
They are really
fascinating creatures.

19:50.062 --> 19:51.345
Did you know that they migrate

19:51.433 --> 19:53.014
to the Everfree
Forest once a year!

19:53.102 --> 19:54.978
Can you imagine
what would happen

19:55.066 --> 19:57.564
if you stumbled on a
whole flock of these?

19:58.636 --> 20:00.853
I have a few ideas.

20:02.397 --> 20:03.797
Agh!

20:04.635 --> 20:07.157
I'm sorry you got turned
to stone looking for me,

20:07.245 --> 20:10.095
but I'm glad Edith was
able to turn you back.

20:10.378 --> 20:12.525
How do you tell the difference?

20:12.813 --> 20:14.915
I have mixed feelings about it.

20:15.003 --> 20:17.786
Technically, I will
always be a stick pony,

20:17.957 --> 20:19.796
but the experience has given me

20:19.884 --> 20:21.281
an even deeper appreciation

20:21.369 --> 20:24.076
for the density and
permanence of rock.

20:24.422 --> 20:25.736
Swoon.

20:26.027 --> 20:27.908
Silverstream and I
should get going,

20:28.017 --> 20:29.673
but I wanted to thank you

20:29.769 --> 20:31.736
for everything you
did to help find her.

20:32.138 --> 20:34.015
I just wish I
hadn't abandoned her

20:34.103 --> 20:35.244
in the first place.

20:35.332 --> 20:37.736
Starlight, you
didn't abandon her.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.322
I might as well have.

20:39.410 --> 20:41.125
And even though it
turned out all right,

20:41.213 --> 20:43.087
things could have
been a lot worse.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.890
You can't be expected to
supervise your students

20:45.978 --> 20:47.468
every second of every day.

20:47.556 --> 20:48.934
I'm not so sure.

20:49.021 --> 20:50.728
I like that
you're always available,

20:50.816 --> 20:53.151
but it kind of makes
it OK to come to you

20:53.239 --> 20:55.813
with stuff that maybe
isn't super important.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.870
Of course, being a
school counselor

20:57.963 --> 20:59.792
is a big responsibility,

20:59.880 --> 21:02.863
but always being at work
isn't fair to anypony.

21:03.023 --> 21:05.028
Especially me.

21:05.277 --> 21:08.549
Do you think if I had
set times to see me,

21:08.637 --> 21:09.633
it might help you decide

21:09.721 --> 21:11.508
what you really
need to talk about?

21:11.596 --> 21:14.510
To be honest, you really
weren't very helpful

21:14.598 --> 21:15.861
with the other stuff anyway.

21:15.948 --> 21:17.375
Yeah. Wait, what?

21:17.463 --> 21:20.406
Happy Spring
Sols-tastic, everypony!

21:20.493 --> 21:22.684
Who wants a piece of
Mrs. Cake's famous...

21:23.889 --> 21:25.664
Petrified dessert?

21:25.752 --> 21:27.997
You had me
at petrified.
