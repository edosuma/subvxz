22:55.589 --> 22:57.297

22:57.381 --> 23:00.464

to really discuss anything.

23:04.547 --> 23:07.422
Finally he talked to me
about a proposition,

23:07.506 --> 23:11.798
and it was a proposition
that would help me.

23:11.881 --> 23:13.714
He asked me, was I familiar

game piece?

23:15.673 --> 23:17.047

47:52.589 --> 47:56.172
We needed to get the check
cashed right there.

47:57.005 --> 48:00.547
And all the money went
right to Jerry's hands.

48:01.422 --> 48:05.047
The teller said to me,
he said, "Get that money.

48:05.130 --> 48:08.464
It's $50,000 taxes on that.

48:08.547 --> 48:10.255
Make sure you get that."

48:10.339 --> 48:12.756
But I didn't think
anything of it.

48:12.839 --> 48:15.172
It just kind of--
you go numb, you know,

48:15.255 --> 48:16.631
there's just no thought.

48:16.714 --> 48:19.631
And that's kind of how I felt,
I think,

48:19.714 --> 48:22.172
with that money,
'cause it's not mine.

48:23.464 --> 48:25.964
He said that he had
to go to Uncle Jerry first,

48:26.047 --> 48:27.589
give him his piece of pie

48:27.673 --> 48:29.631
and then everybody
gets a piece of pie

48:29.714 --> 48:31.673
and it has to go, you know,

48:31.756 --> 48:36.047
in that order
before I can get my money.

48:36.130 --> 48:39.673
So I--I kept calling him and
calling him and he would like

48:39.756 --> 48:42.047
call me back and say, "I'm
gonna get the money for you,

48:42.130 --> 48:43.673
"I got the money on me,

48:43.756 --> 48:46.130
it's gonna be like
another week," or whatever,

48:46.214 --> 48:47.673
he just kept putting me off.

48:47.756 --> 48:51.631
I heard the difference
in his voice, like, like--

48:51.714 --> 48:55.089
like, "Don't bug me.
You're gonna get your money."

48:55.172 --> 48:58.089
I--I believed...

48:58.172 --> 49:01.798
that Gennaro
owed Uncle Jerry money.

49:03.255 --> 49:07.756
I believe the money got too big

49:07.839 --> 49:12.005
to not take a bigger piece
of that pie.

49:12.089 --> 49:17.005
Because the spending habits
became bigger and grander.

49:17.089 --> 49:20.297
And I'm thinking, "Okay,

49:20.381 --> 49:22.839
that's why
I'm not getting my money."

49:25.422 --> 49:28.297
- I'm wondering if the local
banks will have the money...

49:28.381 --> 49:30.297
- Mm-hmm.
[laughter]

49:30.381 --> 49:32.339
- You know, it's a small town.

49:32.422 --> 49:33.964
- It's a cute town.
- It really is.

49:34.047 --> 49:35.464
- It's a great little town.
- I love it!

49:35.547 --> 49:37.756
- It's like living
in the '60s.

49:38.839 --> 49:40.506
- You could ask
any number of people,

49:40.589 --> 49:44.214
what would drive you
to do what these people did?

49:44.297 --> 49:46.130
- And the first one
I peeled off, I believe,

49:46.214 --> 49:48.964
was Pennsylvania Avenue, and
the second one I peeled off

49:49.047 --> 49:51.005
was $1 million
instant prize winner

49:51.089 --> 49:53.547
and it was like,
"Wow, is this for real?"

49:53.631 --> 49:57.214
- A lot of this is stealing
money, using a device to do it

49:57.297 --> 49:59.089
tricking somebody into it.

49:59.172 --> 50:01.172
And then two or more do that,
that's the "conspiracy."

50:01.255 --> 50:03.464
Devereaux's gonna be
so happy I said that.

50:03.547 --> 50:05.506
But it's more than that.

50:05.589 --> 50:08.130
- Breakfast sandwich?
- Yeah, that's what it was.

50:08.214 --> 50:09.964
A breakfast sandwich,
a breakfast sandwich.

50:10.047 --> 50:11.506
- A lot of 'em
are good people,

50:11.589 --> 50:13.089
they make bad decisions,

50:13.172 --> 50:17.130
whether it be they have fallen
into a financial problem

50:17.214 --> 50:20.589
and they hear a nice way
to get out of it.

50:22.005 --> 50:23.839
- That's your motivation.
"Okay.

50:23.923 --> 50:26.506
"I'm gonna do it because,
you know, I need money to--

50:26.589 --> 50:31.255
for my kid's health or school
or I'm gonna retire."

50:31.339 --> 50:34.172
- Human nature

50:34.255 --> 50:37.464
makes us do different things.

50:39.547 --> 50:42.089
People want to justify
what they did

50:42.172 --> 50:43.547
or why they did it

50:43.631 --> 50:46.130
so they can really
live with themselves.

50:46.214 --> 50:50.422
Everyone,
everyone watching this show

50:50.506 --> 50:53.089
cannot stand
in front of a mirror,

50:53.172 --> 50:55.756
look at themselves in the eyes

50:55.839 --> 50:59.297
and say they've never
done something that they wish

50:59.381 --> 51:03.130
they could correct
and take back.

51:08.255 --> 51:11.464
- A couple of years later,
I had this company that was

51:11.547 --> 51:15.047
calling me on a regular basis
trying to get me

51:15.130 --> 51:16.089
to come on this trip.

51:16.172 --> 51:17.839
I was very reluctant,

51:17.923 --> 51:21.506
but they kept saying
it was for all the winners.

51:21.589 --> 51:23.631
They wanna find out
where we are now,

51:23.714 --> 51:27.464
what we're doing, you know,
just a follow-up.

51:30.130 --> 51:32.381
A lot of this stuff
I just wanted to block out

51:32.464 --> 51:34.005
and just forget it

51:34.089 --> 51:38.214
and you just kind of went in
and laughed and talked,

51:38.297 --> 51:41.547
and, you know, it just--try
to make me feel comfortable,

51:41.631 --> 51:44.089
but I never felt comfortable
about this whole thing.

51:44.172 --> 51:46.506
- Um, basically,
what I'd like you to do...

51:46.589 --> 51:48.422
- Somebody asking me
a question from over

51:48.506 --> 51:50.673
on this side,
somebody asking me a question

51:50.756 --> 51:52.673
from over on this side--
that's when I knew

51:52.756 --> 51:54.547
that something wasn't right.

51:54.631 --> 51:58.798
I was about to get sick to
the stomach because I knew...

51:59.839 --> 52:02.839
And I was trying to cut
'em short, and they wouldn't--

52:02.923 --> 52:05.673
they wouldn't stop
asking me questions.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.756
- Um...so did you--
when did you

52:07.839 --> 52:10.422
decide to move
back to Jacksonville?

52:10.506 --> 52:13.339
- I felt like an interrogation
went on because when I came--

52:13.422 --> 52:16.381
when I was in there,
I was like, I could feel

52:16.464 --> 52:20.422
my adrenaline building
a little bit because

52:20.506 --> 52:23.547
I knew that it was...

52:23.631 --> 52:26.714
that they wasn't
asking me questions.

52:26.798 --> 52:29.923
The questions they was
asking me was to just

52:30.005 --> 52:33.839
get it on record,
how I spent the money.

52:35.005 --> 52:37.381
But I felt it.

52:39.339 --> 52:41.714
That feeling
is something else.

52:43.547 --> 52:45.047
- Okay, let's--
let's rehearse it, okay?

52:45.130 --> 52:46.422
And this--you talk
to the camera.

52:46.506 --> 52:47.464
- Okay, okay.

52:47.547 --> 52:48.923
- You can do it slow

52:49.005 --> 52:50.214
because this is like
a rehearsal--

52:52.714 --> 52:54.756
- It--it might have been, um,

52:54.839 --> 52:58.130
but you're about to deprive
someone of their freedom,

52:58.214 --> 52:59.839
you know, their future,

52:59.923 --> 53:02.506
everything from family...

53:02.589 --> 53:06.798
it's not meant to be that
kind of fun for us at all.

53:06.881 --> 53:09.673
It's not fun at all

53:09.756 --> 53:12.172
to deprive liberty to someone.

53:12.255 --> 53:13.964
- We just walked out of there,

53:14.047 --> 53:16.756
and I was kind of numb
walking out the door,

53:16.839 --> 53:19.381
like, "Oh, this is it.

53:19.464 --> 53:22.714
Something is gonna
happen from this."

53:31.005 --> 53:35.381
- It wasn't much longer after
the Fuzzy Bunny situation

53:35.464 --> 53:37.255
I got real depressed.

53:37.339 --> 53:40.255
I didn't eat.
I was just so distraught.

53:40.339 --> 53:41.464
Then I got mad.

53:41.547 --> 53:42.923
I looked over at him

53:43.005 --> 53:45.464
you know, I told him
about Uncle Jerry.

53:45.547 --> 53:47.881
I said, "You know
he asked me to marry him?"

53:47.964 --> 53:50.339
As soon as I said the words,

53:50.422 --> 53:54.047
I was sorry,
'cause I could tell

53:54.130 --> 53:56.714
it was a real thing.

53:56.798 --> 53:58.381
'Cause at first I thought,

53:58.464 --> 54:00.381
this could be a setup,
you know,

54:00.464 --> 54:03.005
maybe they're trying to
find out my loyalty

54:03.089 --> 54:04.839
and it wasn't a setup.

54:04.923 --> 54:08.673
And so he went
and cussed Uncle Jerry out.

54:13.005 --> 54:17.339
The next day,
we're driving down the road.

54:17.422 --> 54:19.589
Jerry's in the passenger seat,

54:19.673 --> 54:23.631
I'm driving, Frankie's
crying in the car seat.

54:23.714 --> 54:27.839
It's bothering Jerry
more than it is me.

54:29.047 --> 54:31.673
And we got in an argument.

54:38.005 --> 54:41.339
And so he says,
"Rob, I gotta put him down,

54:41.422 --> 54:43.964
lay him down.
It's enough."

54:44.047 --> 54:46.589
And so he took him
out of his car seat,

54:46.673 --> 54:50.422
and I'm like,
"God, Jerry, come on."

54:50.506 --> 54:55.339
And a little teardrop came
down my face and I thought,

54:55.422 --> 54:57.964
you know, "I'm never
gonna get out of this."

Final Answer was moving fast.

Everything was on the table.

56:31.005 --> 56:33.005
We thought, "Well,
how much bigger can this get?"

And it would get bigger.

56:34.130 --> 56:35.881
