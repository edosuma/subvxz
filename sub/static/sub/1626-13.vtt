Enjoy this winter wonderland

00:10.176 --> 00:11.977
Why are we open and selling
to no one

00:11.979 --> 00:14.813
When we should be closed
and taking a floor nap?

00:14.815 --> 00:17.349
Yes, max,
it's a blizzard right now,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.184
But in an hour,
it could be 65!

00:19.186 --> 00:21.186
That's the beauty
of global warming.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.955
You, stop!

00:22.957 --> 00:25.691
I'll give you
a peppermint stick!

00:25.693 --> 00:28.227
That is a straw
with red stripes.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.063
Well, what sounds better, max,
a peppermint stick or...

00:31.065 --> 00:33.665
[low voice]
"a straw with red stripes"?

00:33.667 --> 00:37.302
First of all,
great impression of me.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.072
And second,
no one in their right mind

00:40.074 --> 00:42.074
Is stopping for cupcakes
right now.

00:45.512 --> 00:49.515
Oh, hi, girls!
Guess who wants a cupcake.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.417
It's me.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.254
Here you go, sophie.
See, max, we have a customer.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.157
And just so you know,
I'm not gonna pay.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.994
Oh, I'm so glad
you stayed open,

01:01.996 --> 01:05.064
Even with all this snow
everywhere.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.433
You know, good for you.

01:07.435 --> 01:10.602
You two are really committed
to this little cupcake window,

01:10.604 --> 01:13.672
Even when it's stupid.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.677
That's it,
we're closing.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.479
These streets
need to be plowed

01:20.481 --> 01:22.848
More than that poor
married jonas brother.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.316

01:24.318 --> 01:26.118
No, wait.
[gasps] listen!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.519
It's the snowplow.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.088
Now, people will be able
to get to us.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.456
I told you, it is gonna be

01:30.458 --> 01:33.358
One of those magical
new york city nights.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.887
It's still snowing,
and we have no customers.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.555
I had to put money
in the cash register

02:03.557 --> 02:06.959
Just to steal it.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.528
We can't just leave.
Han's not here.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.896
Maybe the trains
aren't running,

02:10.898 --> 02:13.732
Or han got knocked out
by a snowflake.

02:13.734 --> 02:17.269
Well, you know the diner rule,
the one I just made up.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.804
If he's 30 minutes late,

02:18.806 --> 02:22.708
We grab whatever we can fit
in our pockets and leave.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.043
Of course,
if he's 31 minutes late

02:25.045 --> 02:29.081
And there's no one here,
we all get fired.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.750
But I say
we roll the dice.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.051
Whoo!

02:33.053 --> 02:34.720
Well, whatever happened,

02:34.722 --> 02:36.321
We can't run the diner

pick up.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.600
I like this cold weather.

02:48.602 --> 02:52.237
I get to wear
my chin-cheetah hat.

02:52.239 --> 02:55.240
Chin-cheetah?
That's not even a real animal.

02:55.242 --> 02:58.777
Yes, it is.
This was the last one.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.482
Who's that food for?
We don't have any customers.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.317
It's for me and deke.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.319
We're studying pastry school
stuff in the cupcake shop.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.855
We're also putting rocks
in snowballs and throwing them

03:09.857 --> 03:12.858
At hipsters wearing those stupid
stuffed animal hats.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.160
Max, you think
school will be open?

03:15.162 --> 03:17.362
I was hoping it'd be closed, so
I'd have at least have one day

03:17.364 --> 03:18.997
Where I wouldn't have to deal
with the drama

03:18.999 --> 03:20.599
Between me and chef nicolas.

Oh, is that the married man
you kissed?

03:25.673 --> 03:29.174
You!
Like a hundred times.

Ooh!
Let's play a snow day game.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.714
Like what, guess the code
to the safe in han's office?

03:35.716 --> 03:39.218
I know the first two numbers
are eight and nine.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.954
How about--
if you could have sex

03:41.956 --> 03:44.456
With anyone here,
who would it be?

03:44.458 --> 03:48.360
"could have"
or "forced to have"?

03:48.362 --> 03:50.629
Oleg, you go first.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.431
I pick caroline.

03:52.433 --> 03:56.134
Oh, thank you.
That's gross.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.707
No, caroline got mauled
by a bear in the snow.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.208
I did?

04:03.210 --> 04:06.378
No, it was me
in a bear costume.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.281
She never saw me coming.

04:09.283 --> 04:13.151
So my only two choices
are you or earl?

04:13.153 --> 04:16.388
No, earl passed away
in his sleep.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.791
Of course,
you'll feel terrible

04:19.793 --> 04:23.695
When that happens
in a couple of weeks.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.198
Now, if you'd excuse me,
I'm going to go home

04:26.200 --> 04:28.000
And roll me a fatty.

04:28.002 --> 04:31.737
Her name is denise.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.341
Okay, so I pick you.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.477
Me?

04:38.479 --> 04:43.048
You pick me
out of all these two people?

04:43.050 --> 04:45.050
Luis, are you blushing?

04:45.052 --> 04:49.154
No!
I'm wearing blush.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.189
Don't worry, everyone!

04:51.191 --> 04:54.259
I survived!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.399
Still don't know
where han is,

05:00.401 --> 05:04.002
But the new bond villain
just arrived.

05:04.004 --> 05:08.573
Now there's an even bigger
octopussy in town.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.510
I'm very sorry I'm late.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.111
I got stuck in a snow bank,

05:13.113 --> 05:15.681
And I had to pee myself out.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.350
Where's max? And I know
she's not trapped in the storm,

05:18.352 --> 05:22.354
'cause she's the one who
taught me how to pee my way out.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.023
Max, what is the french name
for this pastry

05:25.025 --> 05:27.993
That looks like
a bunch of glazed balls?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.262
A sha-sha-sha?

05:30.264 --> 05:31.763
No.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.299
A doh-doh-doh-doh-doh?

05:34.301 --> 05:37.669
Oh, so close.
It's a "pata-choo."

05:37.671 --> 05:41.006

for pastry school?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.708

was gonna be like,

"which is better, cake or bread?
They're both great, duh.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.512
Here's your degree."

05:47.514 --> 05:49.648

to do side work.

are trying to study.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.791
Oh, max,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.927
We can ask that girl next to us
in class for help.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.295
She speaks french.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.397
You know, the one
with the bubble butt, judy?

06:05.399 --> 06:08.867
Oh, yeah!
Judy with the booty.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.235
You don't know her
that well.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.372
Please, call her
"judith with the boodith."

06:14.807 --> 06:19.578
Max, can I interrupt
this episode of "ass chat"

06:19.580 --> 06:21.580
And talk to you outside
for a second?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.882
Sure.
Hey, max.

06:23.884 --> 06:28.053
Her butt's so big, she walks
into the room doggie-style.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.622
[laughs]

06:30.624 --> 06:33.258
Like I said to my uncle
when he came into my bedroom

06:33.260 --> 06:37.362
In the middle of the night,
"this better be good."

06:38.731 --> 06:40.432
Does it bother you
when deke talks

06:40.434 --> 06:42.601
About other girls with you
like you're a guy?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.969
Not as much
as it bothers me

06:43.971 --> 06:46.738
When you talk to me
like I'm a girl.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.673
Look, deke and I
are just bros.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.509
I don't want
to sleep with him.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.945
Not that there's anything wrong
with two bros sleeping together.

06:53.947 --> 06:57.649
I'm not bromophobic.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.684
It's just not what this is.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.254
So you're sure
there's nothing sexual

07:02.256 --> 07:03.655
Going on
between you and him?

07:03.657 --> 07:05.891
Yes, I'm sure.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.095
No!

07:10.097 --> 07:12.998

a snow swim.

You're right,
nothing sexual there

in underoos.

I was not prepared for this.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.627

the entire subway ride

07:42.629 --> 07:45.464
Preparing you for this.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.232
Okay, look,
should I brace myself

07:47.234 --> 07:48.600
For weirdness
between you two?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.769
And by that,
I mean should I hit this?

No, I'm cool.
Cool as a cucumber.

before you said that?

07:59.346 --> 08:04.149
Oh, yeah.
I am gonna ice him out.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.618
Well, maybe lose
a couple of those cubes,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.487
Because he is your boss,
and the only reason

08:08.489 --> 08:10.889
I can afford to go here is
'cause you work in the office.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.390
Don't worry,
he'll never know.

I'm mad at you?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.574
Then why are you smiling?

09:02.576 --> 09:05.076
This is my fake face.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.679
Then what does
your real face look like?

For tomorrow's test.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.633
I don't know
about the damn test,

09:28.635 --> 09:32.504
But I would ace a pop quiz
on that ass.

09:32.506 --> 09:35.173
Oh, sorry.
I'll get that.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.541
Let judy pick it up.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.210
It's a chance to see it
in motion.

When you add water to the flour
to hydrate the two proteins,

09:50.057 --> 09:52.791
Glutenin and gliadin,
those two proteins

09:52.793 --> 09:54.993
Are drawn to each other,
and they bond.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.862
Like I like to say,
they're hot for each other.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.700
Max, look, they were drawn
to each other, they bonded,

10:01.702 --> 10:04.636
And now, we've got
our own big butt.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.138
Dat ass, though!

10:07.140 --> 10:09.341
More like dat ass dough.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.143
[both laughing]

10:12.145 --> 10:13.678
You need to wet the dough
with water

10:13.680 --> 10:15.513
To keep it
moist and supple.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.850
Wet your bread, everyone,
wet your bread.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.186
Mine's pretty wet.
How's yours?

10:21.188 --> 10:24.222
Mine would be,
but it's on antidepressants.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.058
Work with your partner,
help each other out.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.426
Here, let me help, max.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.928
Yeah, mine's not
as smooth as yours.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.998
Mm, keep kneading it.
You need more water.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.039
It's better, right?

10:41.041 --> 10:44.309
Yeah, I think
wetting it helped.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.052
Caroline, something
is really wrong with me.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.920
Don't freak out.
I'm here for you.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.989
Unless it's something
I can catch.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.693
Something weird happened.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.795
I think I might
have feelings for deke.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.264
Oh, god, no!

11:06.266 --> 11:10.135
I mean, that is interesting.
Let's talk about that.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.836
I don't know what to do.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.338
We're bros, and I don't want
to ruin the friendship,

11:13.340 --> 11:14.639
Which is really unlike me.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.174
I always ruin friendships.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.810
I've been trying to ruin ours
since you moved in.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.146
Well, what changed
with deke?

11:21.148 --> 11:23.715
It was so weird--
he was wetting my bread,

11:23.717 --> 11:27.152
And then my bread was wet,
if you know what I'm saying.

11:27.154 --> 11:31.623
Okay, thank you.
I'm finally off bread.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.224
Look, I understand.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.959
You can't always help
who you're attracted to.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.294
It's like with me
and nicolas--

11:36.296 --> 11:38.563
This is not the same
as you and frenchie.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.699
I wasn't attracted to deke
before today.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.367
The first time
you met nicolas,

11:42.369 --> 11:46.037
Your vagina fell on the floor
and tried to crawl up his leg.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.508
Yes, but I scooped it up
and snapped it back on

11:50.510 --> 11:53.745
Because I was not born
to have sex with a married man.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.980
If I was, I would have flirted
with matt lauer

11:55.982 --> 11:57.649
When he came over
for the christmas tree lighting

11:57.651 --> 11:59.117
At my house.

11:59.119 --> 12:02.620
Matt lauer--
that guy's got game.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.323
No hair, but game.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.793
Hey, everybody, good news!

12:11.097 --> 12:13.098
Oh, I passed
that kidney stone.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.067
Yeah, I think
the skiing loosened it.

12:16.069 --> 12:20.705
Oh, I felt like I was birthing
a baby through my eye hole.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.109
Did you save the stone?

12:24.111 --> 12:27.579
'cause only three more, and you
can make me that necklace.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.114
Max, don't change
the subject.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.615
What are you gonna do
about deke?

12:30.617 --> 12:32.917
Oh, wait,
I love giving advice.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.353
I had my own advice column
in poland.

12:35.355 --> 12:39.591
It was called
"don't do that!"

12:39.593 --> 12:42.327
Sophie, have you ever
had sex with a friend?

12:42.329 --> 12:46.798
[gasps] oh, no.
Are you two gonna do it?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.033
No, that is not what--

12:49.035 --> 12:51.936
Oh, don't do that!

12:51.938 --> 12:54.139
No, it will ruin
your relationship

12:54.141 --> 12:56.074
And my opinion of max.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.543
What about your opinion
of me?

12:58.545 --> 13:02.347
Eh, it's already
pretty low.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.384
What am I gonna do
about deke?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.219
He's coming over
to study tonight.

13:08.221 --> 13:11.189
Oh, god, I sound like
such a girl from the '50s.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.926
Gonna go cry
into my princess phone.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.895
You should tell deke
how you feel,

13:16.897 --> 13:19.397
And tell him tonight, because I
think that judy girl likes him,

13:19.399 --> 13:21.032
And I think
he might like her too.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.468
Why do you say that?
I literally don't care at all,

13:23.470 --> 13:25.804
But I just want to know,
why would you say that?

13:25.806 --> 13:29.974
Max, he likes big butts,
and he cannot lie.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.581
"at what temperature
does sugar crystallize?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.716
Fahrenheit and celsius."
go, max.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.286
Max.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.789
Why are you looking at me
like that?

13:44.791 --> 13:46.491
This doesn't make
any sense!

13:46.493 --> 13:48.827
Well, your book
is upside down.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.432
Hey, hearing a lot
of chitchat in here.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.468
Just wanted to make sure
you two are studying.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.838
[whispering]
stop studying. Kiss him.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.506
[mouthing words]

14:01.508 --> 14:04.843
All right, well,
I better be going.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.145
Just pretend I'm not here.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.981
I always do.

14:09.983 --> 14:13.852
Hey, um, this is weird,
but before we study,

14:13.854 --> 14:15.920
I kind of have something
to tell you.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.723
Weird, 'cause I kinda
have something to tell you.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.693
That is weird.
Maybe it's the same thing.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.828
Someone wants to have sex
with me.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.430
How did you know that?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.999
'cause judy with the booty
just texted me,

14:28.001 --> 14:32.170
"would you like to study tonight
and then have sex with me?"

14:32.172 --> 14:35.106
I think you've interpreted that
correctly.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.843
Wow, she's direct
and, I might add, slutty.

14:38.845 --> 14:42.046
I know, she's got balls
to go with that butt.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.748
So what were you
gonna tell me?

14:43.750 --> 14:48.686
Oh, I was going to tell you
what you just told me,

14:48.688 --> 14:52.690
That judy with the booty
wants to have sex with you.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.425
Glad she got up the guts
to tell you.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.693
So go for it.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.663
Wait, you want me
to go for it?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.665
Yeah, totally,
go for it.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.268
She seems kind of clean.
Go get it.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.836
But we're supposed to study.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.838
I wouldn't want to bail on you
just to go hit that.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.606
Hey, if you don't,
I will.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.508
You're really gonna
pass that ass up?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.210
Now get going,
'cause I have to memorize

15:12.212 --> 15:15.380
What temperature cho-cho-cho
turns into chan-chan-chan.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.048
So you're telling me to go?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.450
I'm saying, "ta-ta-ta."
[chuckles]

15:19.452 --> 15:22.220
Go get her bread wet.
Make it rise, bro.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.888
Okay, then, bro.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.958
I guess I will go,
but with that butt,

15:26.960 --> 15:30.061
If I come back a crack addict,
it's your fault.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.467
Where's he going?
Is this a condom run?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.503
Is he going
on a condom run?

15:38.505 --> 15:41.339
'cause if he is, can you
text him to pick up a diet coke?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.708
Can, not a bottle.
You know the deal.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.044
[scoffs] he's going
to have sex with judy.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.545
You were right,
he's into her.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.647
I'm so glad
I didn't say anything.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.549
That would have felt
terrible.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.850
How do you feel now?

15:52.852 --> 15:54.352
Terrible.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.254
But at least
I didn't embarrass myself.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.724
I was this close
to showing him my gnomes.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.295
Wow, you must
really like him

16:04.297 --> 16:05.430
If you were willing
to let him know

16:05.432 --> 16:07.065
That you're an insane person.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.634
Well, I'm about to be
more screwed than judy,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.269
Because I didn't study
at all.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.171
I know french.
I can help you.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.908
You can help me with the keys
you have to nicolas' office.

16:16.910 --> 16:19.344
We are breaking in
and stealing the test!

16:19.346 --> 16:22.780
Why are you covering his ears?
He knows you steal.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.882
You took him
from someone's yard.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.522
I can't believe we're sneaking
into his office

16:31.524 --> 16:32.523
To steal your test.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.958
This is cheating.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.326
Oh, don't worry,
I hear my teacher's

16:35.328 --> 16:37.862
Kind of into cheating.

16:39.298 --> 16:42.233
Can't argue with that.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.536
Max, please hurry.
Find the test,

16:45.538 --> 16:47.505
And let's get out of here
because we shouldn't be in here

16:47.507 --> 16:50.875
And it smells like him
and I like it.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.745
Okay, one of these papers
has to be it.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.614
Oh, no, everything's written
in secret code!

16:56.616 --> 16:59.017
Max, that's french.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.021
How is it possible he's
even better-looking in photos

17:03.023 --> 17:04.689
Than in real life?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.891
Max, hurry up.
I can't be around his stuff.

17:06.893 --> 17:10.795
My vagina's trying
to get out of my pants again.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.564
Well, get her out here!

17:13.566 --> 17:15.033
Maybe she can help me
look for the test,

17:15.035 --> 17:16.401
'cause you're useless.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.568
[footsteps approaching]

17:17.570 --> 17:19.037
Oh, no, it's nicolas.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.906
I can smell him in the hall,
and I like it.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.374
Max, let's get out of here.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.909
Okay, well, you have to stay
and distract him,

17:24.911 --> 17:26.577
So I can sneak out.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.212
Just pretend you're not mad
and you came in to see him.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.647
I can't just turn it on
like that.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.816
What am I, an actress
at a cocktail party?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.818
You have to, it's
the only logical explanation

17:33.820 --> 17:37.055
You have for being in here.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.456
Caroline.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.324
I've missed you.
I'm in your office.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.060
That's the only logical
explanation I have

17:42.062 --> 17:43.961
For being in here.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.300
Oh! Ow.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.069
Oh, sorry.
Did I hurt you?

17:51.071 --> 17:52.904
Oh, no, I'm sitting
on something.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.640
Oh, sorry. Oh, those are
the exams for today.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.176
Oh, well, let me just
give us some room

17:58.178 --> 18:00.611
While I push these exams
on the floor.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.917
Now, kiss me again,
but this time, lay on top of me,

18:05.919 --> 18:08.086
So your legs are out of the way.
Now, go!

18:16.361 --> 18:18.029
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

18:18.031 --> 18:21.365
You know this can't happen.
You're married.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.600
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:22.602 --> 18:25.670
I have to go
snap something back on.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.010
Well, here are
the test answers,

18:33.012 --> 18:34.078
But I don't know
what the questions are

18:34.080 --> 18:35.546
Because I only got
half the test,

18:35.548 --> 18:38.249
And I'm only half sure
those are the answers.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.384
Whoa, dude,
how did you get this?

18:40.386 --> 18:43.554
I turned caroline
into a whore.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.289
Can you figure out
any of this?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.526
I don't have any idea
what these questions could be.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.228
Ugh!
I didn't study either.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.964
Judy and I got to talking,
and it got pretty involved.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.033
Well, now we're screwed.
I mean, you already got screwed.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.035
Congrats.
Proud of you, bro.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.972
Max, we're gonna flunk
this test.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.273
Better go
to the men's room

19:02.275 --> 19:05.376
And write all the answers
on my penis.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.578
Don't worry,
they'll fit.

19:10.015 --> 19:13.551
I hope you're happy, I've now
kissed a married man twice.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.987
Oh, and here, I grabbed this
from nicolas' office.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.889
That's not the test.
It's a phone bill.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.892
I know, I wanted you to see
he doesn't call his wife much.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.193
[alarm sounding]

19:22.195 --> 19:25.363
Fire!
Everyone get out!

19:25.365 --> 19:28.699
Move your big ass!
We're gonna burn! Scoot.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.134
[alarm sounding]

19:30.136 --> 19:31.869
Oh, my god, max!

19:31.871 --> 19:35.072
I hope nicolas is okay!

19:35.074 --> 19:39.076
Don't worry about me,
I'm right behind you!

19:39.078 --> 19:42.180
Caroline, I want you to be safe.
Come with me.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.583
You're married.
I'll just stay here and burn.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.252
Caroline, don't be crazy.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.455
This is all your fault.
[mouthing]

19:53.992 --> 19:55.826
Don't worry about me,
I'm right behind you!

19:55.828 --> 19:59.197
Max, wait.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.699
It's just a false alarm.
I pulled it.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.401
So classy.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.036
You weren't gonna pass
that test,

20:05.038 --> 20:07.605
And I need you
in that class with me.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.373
You did this for me?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.676
Yeah, and for me too,
I wasn't gonna pass either.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.446
But, look, when you were talking
about me and judy just now,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.014
You seemed kind of weird,
and--

20:17.016 --> 20:19.784
Oh, hey, I just had
a weird moment yesterday

20:19.786 --> 20:22.520
When you were getting my dough
wet and I kinda got turned on,

20:22.522 --> 20:26.123
Sort of thought I liked you.
Yeah, gross, right?

20:26.125 --> 20:29.026
Oh, right, yeah.
Totally gross.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.128
Anyway, dude,
we're just bros.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.699
Okay, bro,
but just so you know,

20:34.701 --> 20:37.235
Nothing happened
between me and judy last night.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.970
That's lame--
if you like a girl,

20:38.972 --> 20:41.072
You should just grab her
and kiss her.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.440
Okay.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.979
Was that weird?

20:47.981 --> 20:50.047
Yeah.
And I liked it.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.884
Max, come on!
Oh.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.786
Sorry to interrupt,

20:55.788 --> 20:57.622
But we're supposed to evacuate
the building.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.124
There's no fire.
Deke pulled the alarm.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.793
I wanted to kiss her.
