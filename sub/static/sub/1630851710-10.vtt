00:00.292 --> 00:02.250
Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:02.250 --> 00:06.959
I just had a consultation
about revising my nose surgery,

00:06.959 --> 00:11.250
and it's gonna cost me $30,000.
-[gasps]

00:11.250 --> 00:14.250
What if we sold feet pics
for Raquel's nose?

00:14.250 --> 00:17.792
-Toes for the nose.
-Toes for Nose!

00:17.792 --> 00:21.792
I haven't had a drop of alcohol
in two years on July 6th.

00:21.792 --> 00:24.000
But now I'm struggling
with getting frustrated

00:24.000 --> 00:25.584
during little things.

00:25.584 --> 00:28.375
Rage is best friends
with addiction.

00:28.375 --> 00:30.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hi. I'm Charli.

00:30.375 --> 00:32.125
-Charli.
-Nice to meet you.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.751
Like, you don't just stand there
and laugh.

00:33.751 --> 00:36.542
Like, you need to check in
and be there for your friend.

00:36.542 --> 00:38.709
You can either be
on the Schwartz and Sandy train,

00:38.709 --> 00:40.209
or, like, get off.

00:40.209 --> 00:42.125
You guys,
good luck with your bar.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.626
They have a deep-rooted history.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.792
Can't understand you.
Oh, it's 'cause

00:45.792 --> 00:47.751
Sandoval's dick
is in your mouth.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.751
Uh, I just gave you
an extra bag.

01:32.751 --> 01:34.334
Perfect, so I'll be in that one.

01:34.334 --> 01:35.417
-Hello, hello.
-Well, here he is.

01:35.417 --> 01:37.417
-Hello!
-James, hello, brother.

01:37.417 --> 01:38.042
Well, hi there.

01:38.042 --> 01:40.167
-Yes, baby!
-Hi, guys.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.542
-How are you, brother?
-Hey, hey. Good.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.626
-Good. How you feeling?
-You good? Hi, I'm Tom.

01:43.626 --> 01:44.751
-Nice to meet you. Kimmy.
-Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

01:44.751 --> 01:46.417
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

01:46.417 --> 01:50.542
We're basically gonna breathe
in ice today.

01:50.542 --> 01:52.209
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't.

01:52.209 --> 01:54.292
You guys just can't
just walk in here

01:54.292 --> 01:57.209
and be like, "No."
-It's a mindset.

01:57.209 --> 01:58.792
This is good for all of us
to learn

01:58.792 --> 02:00.417
simple lessons from today,
and one is that for me,

02:00.417 --> 02:02.375
I want James to work
on a bit of his anger issues.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.792
-Okay.
-He's very short-tempered.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.918
And then, uh, Schwartz--
I really wanna give him

02:05.918 --> 02:07.709
some, like, confidence,
which I think this is gonna do

02:07.709 --> 02:09.584
a great job at doing,
with your help, please.

02:09.584 --> 02:12.417
You guys are gonna use the ice
as your teacher.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.083
Really, the foundation
for everything is learning

02:14.083 --> 02:16.584
to breathe intentionally.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.709
There's a way to breathe
to make yourself more calm.

02:18.709 --> 02:21.667
The ice can also offer benefits
from this that you wouldn't get

02:21.667 --> 02:23.667
if you didn't go this cold.
You're gonna get in.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.584
You're gonna dunk your head
all the way.

02:25.584 --> 02:28.250
-Oh, hell, no.
-Lord, have mercy!

02:28.250 --> 02:29.959
I'm trying to find
different methods

02:29.959 --> 02:31.459
other than just normal therapy

02:31.459 --> 02:33.042
to get out my rage,
get out my anger.

02:33.042 --> 02:34.792
You've got this, bro.
You've got this.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.209
One on one with a therapist--

02:36.209 --> 02:37.876
this never really worked,
you know?

02:37.876 --> 02:39.334
It's like I spill my heart out,

02:39.334 --> 02:40.250
I tell 'em everything,
and then they're just ----ing

02:40.250 --> 02:42.584
looking at me with a dumb face
like...

02:42.584 --> 02:44.000
They don't know what to say.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.584
-Go together. 3...2...1.
-Oh, I can't, I can't.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.584
You can. Go ahead. Jump in.
Go back.

02:51.584 --> 02:54.250
[yelling]

02:54.250 --> 02:55.250
-Are you ----ing kidding me?
-I'm serious.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.125
I'm thinking, James,
like, don't be a pussy.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.375
-Try a breath.
-Breathe, breathe. [laughs]

02:59.375 --> 03:01.125
-Hop over.
-God! [bleep]!

03:01.125 --> 03:03.334
[bleep]! Oh!

03:03.334 --> 03:05.334
-Let's go!
-[bleep] you!

03:05.334 --> 03:07.584
Oh, my God, just get
in the ----ing ice bath!

03:07.584 --> 03:08.751
[bleep]! Let's do this!

03:08.751 --> 03:12.626
-Yes! Hands up, legs up.
-Whoo!

03:12.626 --> 03:15.501
Whoa! Whoa! Whoo!

03:15.501 --> 03:18.834
Breathe in. Hold for, like,
two seconds, then exhale, okay?

03:18.834 --> 03:21.459
So try to breathe in
through your nose. You're okay.

03:21.459 --> 03:22.959
-You did it. Look at you.
-Thou shall prevail.

03:22.959 --> 03:25.584
We gotta breathe, James.
In. On you.

03:25.584 --> 03:26.709
-[bleep]
-Stay with it.

03:26.709 --> 03:30.834
-We're almost there.
-Guys, I'm so ----ing failing.

03:30.834 --> 03:32.250
-Failing, failing, failing.
-Breathe, breathe, breathe.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.459
Dunk, and you guys are done.

03:33.459 --> 03:34.792
-Dunk and we're done?
-Yes. Yes.

03:34.792 --> 03:36.083
Then what? Then what?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.167
That's three minutes.
That's it. Good.

03:38.167 --> 03:39.626
-I'm gonna hang out for a while.
-You wanna keep going?

03:39.626 --> 03:41.125
Yes, baby!

03:41.125 --> 03:43.459
-I'm dead inside.
-[laughs] "I'm dead inside."

03:43.459 --> 03:48.167
So my logic is if hot baths
are bad for my sperm count...

03:48.167 --> 03:50.501
-And do you sit in hot tubs?
-Take a lot of baths.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.375
The reason the testes are on
the outside of our body is that

03:52.375 --> 03:54.459
it has to be even cooler.
-No.

03:54.459 --> 03:59.292
Then cold baths...are good.
Huh?

03:59.292 --> 04:01.125
You guys are at 3:42.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.459
-You're ----ing legends, mate.
-You're done.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.334
Holy smokes!

04:04.334 --> 04:06.834
I'm not sure that I've, like,
taught myself a way

04:06.834 --> 04:08.792
to breathe out my anger.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.542
My body--
it's literally vibrating

04:10.542 --> 04:11.417
for the whole thing.
-That's what it is.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.083
The only thing
that I could think of is

04:13.083 --> 04:14.334
[bleep], now I'm freezing.

04:14.334 --> 04:17.000
So I guess that's, like,
not being angry.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.959
So that's progress, right?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.083
Thank you, dude.
Thank you, Brock...

04:20.083 --> 04:22.250
-Yeah. Yeah.
-...for bringing us here.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.542
This was completely challenging
for me,

04:23.542 --> 04:26.334
and I feel like people can get
a rise out of me pretty easily.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.584
I wanna learn how to make it
a little bit harder for them.

04:27.584 --> 04:30.209
-Do you know what I'm saying?
-You gotta refine that sh--.

04:30.209 --> 04:31.334
-And this--this sh--...
-Find that raw energy

04:31.334 --> 04:32.584
and fire you have and refine it.

04:32.584 --> 04:34.959
These practices are made
for that, right?

04:34.959 --> 04:37.959
Like for me, when I was
growing up and all that, like,

04:37.959 --> 04:41.083
being a kid with four fingers
in school, kids are cruel.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.626
-Ruthless.
-Cruel.

04:42.626 --> 04:44.959
And so, like, that for me,
seeing that side,

04:44.959 --> 04:47.918
made me a different person.
-Mm.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.167
I grew up on a dairy farm,

04:49.167 --> 04:50.417
and my dad was working
one morning,

04:50.417 --> 04:53.959
and I went behind the bull,
and it startled and kicked me,

04:53.959 --> 04:56.584
and I fell into the gate
that was moving,

04:56.584 --> 04:59.125
and, um, my hand got caught
in the gears.

04:59.125 --> 05:02.292
Pretty crazy, huh?

05:02.292 --> 05:03.584
I relate with you
about the bullying stuff, too.

05:03.584 --> 05:07.292
Like, sometimes when I get into
these confrontational moments,

05:07.292 --> 05:10.334
it kind of throws me back
into this mindset

05:10.334 --> 05:12.125
where I have to defend myself.

05:12.125 --> 05:13.292
It's about ----ing time
that I just grow up

05:13.292 --> 05:15.626
and learn from them, bro.
-Yeah.

05:15.626 --> 05:18.334
I have the love of my life.
I'm focused on my DJ career.

05:18.334 --> 05:21.292
I wanna give the world music
and love and light,

05:21.292 --> 05:24.626
and you know what? My temper
is just gonna hold me back.

05:24.626 --> 05:25.667
----ing overcome--

05:25.667 --> 05:26.834
Redirect that energy.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.918
My day here is done. You boys
have learnt your lessons.

05:29.918 --> 05:33.709

-You're welcome. [laughs]

05:33.709 --> 05:46.250

05:46.250 --> 05:49.083
-Lilly, it's a friend.
-Hello.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.125
-Hi, Lise.
-Hello.

05:50.125 --> 05:53.834
-Friendly?
-Very friendly.

05:53.834 --> 05:57.667
I always say if Jesus had a dog,
it would have been Lilly.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.709
Oh, Jesus has many dogs.

06:00.709 --> 06:01.959
And you've had her for how long?

06:01.959 --> 06:05.125
10 years. She's on medication.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.751
-Aw!
-Her liver levels

06:07.751 --> 06:10.792
are really high, which,
you know, could be many things,

06:10.792 --> 06:12.751
including cancer, so...

06:12.751 --> 06:15.000
This is the worst case scenario
for me always.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.209
Yeah.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.125
I've been through it
so many times.

06:18.125 --> 06:21.292
Lilly has been my companion,
my ride-or-die

06:21.292 --> 06:23.042
since I was 21 years old.

06:23.042 --> 06:25.751
Lilly got me through
my drunken days

06:25.751 --> 06:28.042
where I couldn't get out of bed.

06:28.042 --> 06:31.876
I just need someone who really
understands what it's like

06:31.876 --> 06:34.042
to love a fur baby.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.042
Who better than Lisa Vanderpump?

06:36.042 --> 06:37.417
Well, so you've done
blood tests.

06:37.417 --> 06:39.375
Yes. I'm putting it
into the atmosphere

06:39.375 --> 06:41.959
that we're gonna get
all great news.

06:41.959 --> 06:44.542
This baby doesn't definitely
doesn't take after Randall then.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.876
Just look how relaxed
and quiet this baby is. [laughs]

06:46.876 --> 06:48.792
She's sleeping.
You wanna come see her nursery?

06:48.792 --> 06:49.959
I'm gonna hand her off to the--

06:49.959 --> 06:51.667
I do.
I wanna see the whole house.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.459
-Well, there's not much to see.
-Lala's come a long way,

06:54.459 --> 06:57.250
and I'm happy to have been
part of her journey.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.083
She used to be sneaking drinks
behind the hostess stand.

07:00.083 --> 07:04.083
-Hi, Cynthia.
-Oh! It's so sweet.

07:04.083 --> 07:07.792
And now here she is, mother,
and it's pretty lovely to see.

07:07.792 --> 07:10.584
She's so pretty.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.584
-She looks like you.
-She does.

07:12.584 --> 07:14.667
I like that about her.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.501
She came out super hairy.

07:16.501 --> 07:17.792
Oh.

07:17.792 --> 07:19.167
I thought, when I shave Randall,

07:19.167 --> 07:21.292
I'm gonna have to shave her,
too.

07:21.292 --> 07:23.125
-You have to shave Randall?
-Yeah.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.459
-Like where?
-Like in his bum-bum.

07:25.459 --> 07:27.459
[laughs] Oh, no!

07:27.459 --> 07:28.626
He turns around
and spreads his legs.

07:28.626 --> 07:30.459
And he goes...
[imitates buzzing]

07:30.459 --> 07:31.626
-No.
-Yes.

07:31.626 --> 07:33.584
If I have to, like, visit
down there...

07:33.584 --> 07:35.918
What do you mean,
if you have to visit down there?

07:35.918 --> 07:39.083
-With my mouth.
-[laughs]

07:39.083 --> 07:41.375
That's a little TMI,
I have to say.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.250
Have you never heard
of the expression

07:42.250 --> 07:44.584
"Close your eyes
and think of England"?

07:44.584 --> 07:47.542
It bring tears to my eyes,
just the thought of it.

07:47.542 --> 07:50.250
Do you want a pastry? I'm gonna
have, like, a bite of it.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.626
I'm not gonna have
this whole thing.

07:51.626 --> 07:53.292
You cannot tell me that

07:53.292 --> 07:54.834
you're eating stuff like that
and you look like this.

07:54.834 --> 07:58.000
Maybe I'll have this other half
of what you had.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.751
I got invited
to Brock's birthday.

07:59.751 --> 08:01.000
Mm.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.959
It was
at Tom and Ariana's house.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.918
-I went off on Schwartz.
-Why?

08:05.918 --> 08:09.292
So I'm talking to him
about defending his wife more.

08:09.292 --> 08:11.417
She was very much
looking forward

08:11.417 --> 08:13.417
to being a part of that bar...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.584
...that they're--
that the Toms are doing.

08:15.584 --> 08:17.584
She probably right now
is feeling like

08:17.584 --> 08:20.876
she would like something to--
to get her teeth into.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.459
I know.

08:22.459 --> 08:24.083
-With all the girls--
-Well, what was this thing

08:24.083 --> 08:26.834
with all the smelly feet?

08:26.834 --> 08:28.334
-Oh, my God.
-Did you do that?
