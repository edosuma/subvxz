00:29.260 --> 00:30.827
<i>This battle might just spike
the murder rate</i>

00:30.829 --> 00:33.130
<i>more than Reagan

00:33.132 --> 00:34.265

00:34.267 --> 00:37.604
<i>turn this shit off
and suck a dick!</i>

00:40.005 --> 00:43.941
They like: "Yo, X-Trakt,
why you always talk about

00:43.943 --> 00:49.612
the thugs and the TECS,
the slugs and the Feds,

00:49.614 --> 00:55.719
the drugs and the checks
I give 'em a 360,

00:55.721 --> 00:57.688
shrug to the neck

00:57.690 --> 01:00.390
Like, this is battle rap,
motherfucker,

01:00.392 --> 01:03.993
what you expect?

01:03.995 --> 01:08.199
I don't care if he was lean
sipper or you sippin' at me

01:08.201 --> 01:10.300
look at my team
squeeze triggers,

01:10.302 --> 01:15.104
blow his guts out,
see if he got a clean liver.

01:15.106 --> 01:16.705
Boy, you look mad fake

01:16.707 --> 01:19.809
like them
high-frame-rate TV pictures.

01:19.811 --> 01:23.145
You think you Behn Grym,
I'll leave him stretched out,

01:23.147 --> 01:24.783
you Reed Richards!

01:26.618 --> 01:29.753
Fantastic Four when
I let the palm cock.

01:29.755 --> 01:32.556
When I let
The Thing go "pop pop,"

01:32.558 --> 01:35.592
you can tell that he
ain't a hard rock.

01:35.594 --> 01:36.559
Adam.

01:36.561 --> 01:37.360
Adam.

01:37.362 --> 01:38.395
What did that one mean?

01:38.397 --> 01:39.429
It's a superhero line.

01:39.431 --> 01:40.698
The other guy's
name is Behn Grym,

01:40.700 --> 01:42.666
which is The Thing's alter
ego from Fantastic Four.

01:42.668 --> 01:44.401
Reed Richards is the
leader of the group,

01:44.403 --> 01:45.335
the stretchy guy.

01:45.337 --> 01:46.871
Yeah, that part I got.

01:46.873 --> 01:47.704
What's the other meaning?.

01:47.706 --> 01:49.073
He was "letting go"
of a "thing."

01:49.075 --> 01:50.841
What's the thing?

01:50.843 --> 01:52.408
It's a gun.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.444
It's a gun metaphor.

01:54.446 --> 01:56.580
Probably just assume
everything is a gun metaphor.

01:56.582 --> 01:57.881
Mmm.

01:57.883 --> 02:01.351
And I'll kill anybody
on this artist stage.

02:01.353 --> 02:05.089
Y'all know my slogan:
get this trash outta here,

02:05.091 --> 02:07.925
IT'S GARBAGE DAY!!!

02:11.329 --> 02:12.563
What you gonna do, Grym?

02:12.565 --> 02:15.501
He just called you garbage,
what you gonna do?

02:17.568 --> 02:21.907
You said you got
the thing on you...

02:22.875 --> 02:24.644
where's it at?

02:26.445 --> 02:28.177
Is it there?

02:28.179 --> 02:30.647
Is it here?

02:30.649 --> 02:33.249
I guess they must call
your gun "Sue Storm,"

02:33.251 --> 02:36.420
'cause that bitch
just disappeared.

02:36.422 --> 02:39.689
So he should Do the
Right Thing and walk away

02:39.691 --> 02:41.591
before I beat him to death.

02:41.593 --> 02:44.228
'Cause he gon' feel the
Hate in these punches,

02:44.230 --> 02:46.796
I'm Radio Raheem
with the left!

02:46.798 --> 02:49.466
This motherfucker go online
and Google "food porn",

02:49.468 --> 02:53.435
as it's known
to you... porn.

02:53.437 --> 02:56.238
You so fat when you tuck
a gun in your waist,

02:56.240 --> 02:58.977
you need to use
a fuckin' shoe horn.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.177
Uh-uh.

03:01.179 --> 03:04.515
I'm going take it past rap,
catch him not looking and

03:04.517 --> 03:06.383
drain the MAC fast.

03:06.385 --> 03:08.718
The way I Blind Sided
this fat nigga,

03:08.720 --> 03:13.323
Sandra Bullock
couldn't save his black ass!

03:13.325 --> 03:18.494
Yeah, that's right,
you used to be the shit,

03:18.496 --> 03:20.897
but lately X fell in tiers.

03:20.899 --> 03:23.367
It's the same as you
outgrowing your shirt sizes...

03:23.369 --> 03:27.006
we ain't seen X excel
(XXL) in years!

03:28.472 --> 03:30.540
Why does he keep
saying "X" so much?

03:30.542 --> 03:32.009
He's doing name flips.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.177
The guy's name is X-Trakt.

03:33.179 --> 03:34.444
Thus the "X" bars...

03:34.446 --> 03:35.744
"Bars?"

03:35.746 --> 03:36.880
It comes from
the music term.

03:36.882 --> 03:38.047
Like a bar of music.

03:38.049 --> 03:40.149
Except in battle rap it has
a specific connotation...

03:40.151 --> 03:41.617
a bar instead of a line.

03:41.619 --> 03:44.187
And the difference is?

03:44.189 --> 03:45.321
It's hard to explain...

03:45.323 --> 03:46.389
More wordplay?

03:46.391 --> 03:48.058
Most bars are based on
homophones...

03:48.060 --> 03:50.627
"X excel, XXL."

03:50.629 --> 03:52.428
Oh, so if
there's a homophobe,

03:52.430 --> 03:54.433
it's a bar.

03:55.468 --> 03:56.467
Homophone.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.267
And your baby moms
only with you

03:58.269 --> 03:59.836
to collect those checks, bro.

03:59.838 --> 04:02.373
He be givin' way more than
just hugs and kisses

04:02.375 --> 04:05.978
to the ex-ho X owe.

04:06.445 --> 04:07.777
Aight.

04:07.779 --> 04:11.047
You wifed up a slut who
gets piped down religiously

04:11.049 --> 04:12.648
like she some sorta Rasta.

04:12.650 --> 04:14.917
And you let her
raise your seed,

04:14.919 --> 04:16.887
what, you thought you
found a whoreto-culture.

04:16.889 --> 04:20.390
Your baby boy is born,
she gotcha,

04:20.392 --> 04:22.258
I know you wish you
woulda left that

04:22.260 --> 04:24.895
load in the Ho's mouth.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.431
How your name X-Trakt when
you don't know

04:27.433 --> 04:29.668
when to pull out???

04:30.301 --> 04:31.501
Now that is a BAR!

04:31.503 --> 04:32.935
Oh, okay, I get it.

04:32.937 --> 04:35.104
So the defining characteristic
of a "bar" is just how much

04:35.106 --> 04:37.739
gross misogyny you can
cram into one sentence.

04:37.741 --> 04:38.808
Don't worry,
it's all an act.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.376
I don't think
X-Trakt even has kids.

04:40.378 --> 04:41.577
It's all for the
sake of wordplay.

04:41.579 --> 04:42.979
Puns about hating women.

04:42.981 --> 04:44.548
Aww.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.683
Look, I don't know how
anybody can be a good person

04:46.685 --> 04:48.418
when they spend all of their
time thinking of horrible

04:48.420 --> 04:50.590
things to say about someone.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.258
Whoo.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.592
See, I just dug your grave

04:55.594 --> 04:57.560
so they can put your
fat-ass corpse into.

04:57.562 --> 04:59.830
It's so ironic... as
much as you lift a fork,

04:59.832 --> 05:02.032
now they gotta forklift YOU!

05:04.000 --> 05:10.074

05:11.810 --> 05:14.880
This is my chance,
be right back.

05:18.015 --> 05:18.948
Uh, Behn?

05:18.950 --> 05:20.116
That was amazing.

05:20.118 --> 05:22.152
It was intense.

05:22.154 --> 05:24.221
Adam, we spoke on Twitter?

05:24.223 --> 05:25.188
Reporter, right?

05:25.190 --> 05:26.257
Academic, actually.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.291
Grad student.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.325
I'm working on
my Master's thesis.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.693
What're you doing?

05:29.695 --> 05:31.594
- It's an English MA program...
- I know what a thesis is.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.962
What are you doing it on?

05:32.964 --> 05:34.763
Oh... The varied
poetic functions of

05:34.765 --> 05:36.167
the N-word in battle rap.

05:37.199 --> 05:38.601
That shit was tight,
wolf, you killed him.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.402
That XOXO bar?

05:40.404 --> 05:41.938
Fire.

05:41.940 --> 05:42.906
Respect.

05:42.908 --> 05:44.110
Respect.

05:47.111 --> 05:47.943
Respect.

05:47.945 --> 05:48.411
Respect.

05:48.413 --> 05:49.678
Respect.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.380
I'm interested in how the
N-word can be used as

05:51.382 --> 05:53.683
an intensifier for both comedic
and intimidatory effect,

05:53.685 --> 05:55.719
or in some cases as a
rhythmic flourish to hit

05:55.721 --> 05:56.553
a particular flow.

05:56.555 --> 05:58.755
Yo, Grym!

05:58.757 --> 06:01.291
My girl wanna
suck your dick,

06:01.293 --> 06:03.329
and I don't even mind.

06:04.128 --> 06:05.294
Respect.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.967
I'm also interested in
the racial identity aspect.

06:11.969 --> 06:14.070
For example, how Puerto Ricans
and Dominicans use it

06:14.072 --> 06:16.472
to signify their
African ancestry.

06:16.474 --> 06:17.707
So you from New York?

06:17.709 --> 06:20.010
I'm at Berkeley
now, but yeah.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.178
How'd you know?

06:21.180 --> 06:22.945
Well you just mentioned
Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.882
If you were from Cali,
you would've said Mexicans.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.984
So Mexicans use
the N-word too?

06:27.986 --> 06:29.786
Well, it all depends,
you know.

06:29.788 --> 06:30.887
Definitely in the Bay, a'ight?

06:30.889 --> 06:32.789
Especially East Oakland,
you know,

06:32.791 --> 06:34.724
they be givin' all types of
people passes over there.

06:34.726 --> 06:36.392
You don't remember
a few years back,

06:36.394 --> 06:38.128
that white chick V-Nasty?

06:38.130 --> 06:39.328
Sure.

06:39.330 --> 06:40.798
She got some attention from
Kreayshawn when she had that

06:40.800 --> 06:42.168
one hit because they were
in the same crew, right?

06:43.199 --> 06:44.601
That was a battle rapper who
wrote that one hit for her.

06:44.603 --> 06:46.536
I'm good, man.

06:46.538 --> 06:48.005
Things gon' be
different in LA,

06:48.007 --> 06:50.707
especially with that gang shit.
No Mexicans going down there

06:50.709 --> 06:52.109
saying it without the hard "er."

06:52.111 --> 06:53.142
This is great, man.

06:53.144 --> 06:54.510
Thank you.

06:54.512 --> 06:57.181
Look, if you really
want a Nigga Pass,

06:57.183 --> 06:58.181
your best bet?

06:58.183 --> 06:59.515
Move back to New York.

06:59.517 --> 07:02.452
Claim you about a
quarter Spanish...

07:02.454 --> 07:03.721
Hmm...

07:03.723 --> 07:04.854
Maybe an eighth.

07:04.856 --> 07:07.556
Or I could just
move to East Oakland.

07:07.558 --> 07:09.592
You better off
claiming you Spanish.

07:09.594 --> 07:12.662
Why would you...
I'm not trying to get a pass.

07:12.664 --> 07:15.664
Any time a white boy
acts who can say "nigga,"

07:15.666 --> 07:18.534
it's because he
really wanna say "nigga."

07:18.536 --> 07:21.337
It's just the
subject of my thesis.

07:21.339 --> 07:22.671
So you want to
write "nigga."

07:22.673 --> 07:24.674
Oh shit,
Behn fucking Grym!

07:24.676 --> 07:26.476
Nigga, you gotta
do a shot with me.

07:26.478 --> 07:27.911
Respect.

07:27.913 --> 07:28.745
Respect!

07:28.747 --> 07:30.113
This is definitely a...

07:30.115 --> 07:31.013
crash course.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.250
What, he's my
favorite battle rapper!

07:33.252 --> 07:34.984
Why you talking to me, hmm?

07:34.986 --> 07:36.685
There's plenty other
N-words you could be

07:36.687 --> 07:39.257
asking about N-words.

07:40.558 --> 07:42.291
I guess it just made
sense to start

07:42.293 --> 07:43.626
with my favorite writer.

07:43.628 --> 07:45.462
Your structure
is crazy, man.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.729
The way that
most battlers write,

07:46.731 --> 07:48.464
they do the wordplay
but the lines

07:48.466 --> 07:49.666
don't connect with each other.

07:49.668 --> 07:51.099
But with your stuff, the
setup and the punch line

07:51.101 --> 07:53.536
all flows together, conceptually
and then all ties back into

07:53.538 --> 07:55.505
a larger theme or idea.

07:55.507 --> 07:57.840
It's like a master essay.

07:57.842 --> 07:59.476
So you read essays
all day about

07:59.478 --> 08:01.477
letting the chopper spray?

08:01.479 --> 08:02.814
Respect.

08:03.481 --> 08:04.916
Next question.

08:09.187 --> 08:09.820
There you are.

08:09.822 --> 08:10.820
I've been looking forever.

08:10.822 --> 08:13.089
What's a "jump off"?

08:13.091 --> 08:13.823
Sorry.

08:13.825 --> 08:15.159
This is my girlfriend Maya.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.359
Maya, this is...

08:16.361 --> 08:17.493
Behn Grym.

08:17.495 --> 08:18.827
Hey.

08:18.829 --> 08:20.597
I am really glad that I get
to talk to you about this.

08:20.599 --> 08:22.298
I mean, I was super
surprised at the end

08:22.300 --> 08:23.467
by your battle there...

08:23.469 --> 08:24.900
Maya, I don't think that this
is really a good time...

08:24.902 --> 08:26.335
...they didn't announce
a winner or anything!

08:26.337 --> 08:27.402
I mean, what's up with that?

08:27.404 --> 08:29.104
Oh, that.

08:29.106 --> 08:32.308
Judged battles aren't
really a thing anymore.

08:32.309 --> 08:34.010
You gotta blame your
own coast for that.

08:34.011 --> 08:35.611
Buncha
delusional just-can't-

08:35.613 --> 08:37.013
admit-when-they-lost
motherfuckers.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.616
New York hasn't lost a
rap battle in 10 years.

08:39.618 --> 08:41.717
I clearly won, though.

08:41.719 --> 08:43.452
Oakland, is y'all in here??

08:43.453 --> 08:45.722
If you got any drugs left,
you need to let them shits

08:45.724 --> 08:47.023
circulate through
your system right now,

08:47.025 --> 08:49.559
'cause this next match finna
be on some unprecedented

08:49.561 --> 08:51.327
seismic event
type shit, ya dig!

08:51.329 --> 08:53.597
Rapper on my left,
state your name, playa.

08:53.599 --> 08:54.898
And it's ya boy Big Zee.

08:54.900 --> 08:58.869
Shout out to Oakland,
the whole 510. Let's get it.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.970
And the rapper to my right
needs no introduction,

09:00.972 --> 09:03.305
but I'm gonna let him
talk his shit anyway...

09:03.307 --> 09:06.709
MEGATON, BIIIIIIITCH!!!

09:06.711 --> 09:08.343
Is that guy...

09:08.345 --> 09:09.078
stable?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.078
A criminal jury
may one day

09:10.080 --> 09:12.182
have to rule on that question.

09:13.285 --> 09:15.586
I'm the only reason these
people here know what your

09:15.588 --> 09:18.688
name is, but you gon' be
like Kim K after we tape this

09:18.690 --> 09:19.989
and I'm gonna
be like Ray J,

09:19.991 --> 09:23.162
since I'm the dickhead
that's making you famous.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.764
As far as these fans,
I told y'all from before,

09:27.766 --> 09:29.598
I'm the one that
opened up this door,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.167
yeah, I showed
you my support.

09:31.169 --> 09:33.535
So now I'm like Khloe when
she goin' through divorce,

09:33.537 --> 09:34.904
'Cause I can leave
the ring now

09:34.906 --> 09:37.473
since I don't
owe-them anymore.

09:37.475 --> 09:41.044
Man, black chicks love me, they
think I'm an awesome person,

09:41.046 --> 09:42.444
and they
always flirtin',

09:42.446 --> 09:44.747
you can tell this chick here
probably wants some Persian,

09:44.749 --> 09:46.817
As soon as I walked in
and took off my turban,

09:46.819 --> 09:50.621
She got on the floor
and she started twerkin'.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.021
Fuck your life,
fuck your wife,

09:52.023 --> 09:53.490
fuck your whole
entire existence,

09:53.492 --> 09:56.760
Man, if I seen Bill Cosby slip
your wife a pill in her drink

09:56.762 --> 09:58.494
and I was
the only eyewitness,

09:58.496 --> 10:01.297
I would mind
my own business.

10:01.299 --> 10:02.866
Yeah, Yeah.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.269
Me and you, man,
we ain't the same,

10:05.271 --> 10:06.602
you nothing but
a fake character,

10:06.604 --> 10:08.572
Man, we ain't from
the same caliber,

10:08.574 --> 10:10.274
Give me space, man,
step back,

10:10.276 --> 10:13.476
this fist is a face damager,
Give me distance and space

10:13.478 --> 10:16.478
or I'll leave your face with
Stitches like Game's manager

10:16.480 --> 10:17.679
Yo, get outta my face.

10:17.681 --> 10:19.783
Well, that's all
for this event.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.116
What do you mean?

10:21.118 --> 10:24.053
- There's two more after...
- Get outta my FUCKIN' face!

10:24.055 --> 10:25.156
Jesus!

10:26.691 --> 10:28.426
That's what I mean.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.265
Damn, Mega really suckered
dude, bruh.

10:36.267 --> 10:37.333
Ain't no sucker.

10:37.335 --> 10:38.268
He warned him twice.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.470
What he supposed to do,
narrate it on some

10:40.472 --> 10:42.138
"March of the Penguins" shit?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.506
Well, we should
probably take off.

10:43.508 --> 10:47.276
Thanks again
for everything.

10:47.278 --> 10:49.379
Make sure you send me
that draft when you done.

10:49.381 --> 10:51.780
Make sure you don't say
nothing wild out of pocket.

10:51.782 --> 10:52.348
Yeah.

10:52.350 --> 10:53.049
Of course.

10:53.051 --> 10:53.616
Bye!

10:53.618 --> 10:54.784
You definitely won that.

10:54.786 --> 10:57.189
I said YO!

10:58.824 --> 11:00.823
It's Billy Pistolz, man.

11:00.825 --> 11:02.893
Let me talk to you
for a quick second.

11:02.895 --> 11:06.395
So I just saw you on the stage,
but I wanna know

11:06.397 --> 11:08.231
if you rep that
REAL hip-hop shit,

11:08.233 --> 11:09.631
know what I'm talkin' bout.

11:09.633 --> 11:12.235
So what's good with you and
me getting it in right now?

11:12.237 --> 11:17.540
If you really real,
I'm ready to battle right NOW.

11:17.542 --> 11:18.408
Right now.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.775
Look, man,
I just finished a battle...

11:19.777 --> 11:21.010
I don't need a stage,

11:21.012 --> 11:23.178
we can do this shit
the street way,

11:23.180 --> 11:26.915
Shoot at his ride, it's like
a helicopter accident

11:26.917 --> 11:31.587
how I got this chopper
on the freeway /

11:31.589 --> 11:34.789
Shells as big as coconuts,

11:34.791 --> 11:36.927
that's what I'm sendin' him /

11:36.929 --> 11:38.294
And your girl?

11:38.296 --> 11:39.929
I won't skip-her,

11:39.931 --> 11:44.002
but after I'm done
with you, I'ma kill-again.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.307
Did you just try to make "kill
again" sound like "Gilligan"?

11:50.309 --> 11:53.677
Man, niggas out here dropping
Gilligan's Island bars, bruh.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.579
Man, that whole squad
on that real shit,

11:57.581 --> 11:59.281
only God can judge us /

11:59.283 --> 12:01.684
When we servin'
it's like a hot plate,

12:01.686 --> 12:04.787
- I warn you not to touch us...
- Alright, alright,

12:04.789 --> 12:05.954
alright.

12:05.956 --> 12:08.725
I'ma let one of the
lil' homies handle this.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.030
How about my
young white boy here?

12:11.463 --> 12:12.397
He's a killer.

12:17.199 --> 12:17.600
Actually, I don't rap.

12:17.602 --> 12:18.702
So what's good, then?

12:18.704 --> 12:21.670
You heard what I spit,
do you really think you can

12:21.672 --> 12:23.372
fuck with Billy Pistolz, man?

12:23.374 --> 12:27.077
If that's the case,
then spit your shit!

12:27.079 --> 12:30.149
SPIT. YOUR. SHIT.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.715
Okay.

12:41.893 --> 12:43.494
Sup?

12:53.104 --> 12:56.505
You're here trying
to battle Behn Grym,

12:56.507 --> 13:00.976
'cause he's got the kind
of stardom you seek /

13:00.978 --> 13:02.912
But you'll never reach that bar,

13:02.914 --> 13:06.418
'cause all your bars
are a reach /

13:12.458 --> 13:16.358
You clearly wish you had
a darker brown skin tone /

13:16.360 --> 13:19.895
You're suffering from
"I-Wanna-BeDown" syndrome...

13:19.897 --> 13:21.731
And also Down's syndrome.

13:23.133 --> 13:24.967
You've been a dad since
you were still a teen,

13:24.969 --> 13:26.601
but it's not how
it really seems /

13:26.603 --> 13:28.069
That kid is not your son,

13:28.071 --> 13:30.273
he doesn't have
a single Billy gene

13:30.275 --> 13:32.976
You spit all this gun talk of
a violent mind at work /

13:32.978 --> 13:34.343
But got nothing to
back it up with,

13:34.345 --> 13:37.416
that's a Miley Cyrus twerk!

13:39.017 --> 13:42.718
Miley Cyrus just
bodied Gilligan's Island!

13:42.720 --> 13:44.587
Pistolz!

13:44.589 --> 13:46.021
Where you learn that shit?

13:46.023 --> 13:49.360
I do some
beat poetry sometimes.

13:50.362 --> 13:53.098
Fuck a thesis,
you got BARS!

14:10.015 --> 14:11.112
Did that just happen?

14:11.114 --> 14:12.615
I can't believe
that just happened.

14:12.617 --> 14:13.548
It happened.

14:13.550 --> 14:14.884
Can you tell me if
my hand is still shaking?

14:14.886 --> 14:17.252
This was the
greatest day of my life.

14:17.254 --> 14:19.355
You didn't tell
me that you rap.

14:19.357 --> 14:20.090
I don't.

14:20.092 --> 14:21.290
Sometimes when
I watch battles,

14:21.292 --> 14:22.625
lines will just
pop in my head,

14:22.627 --> 14:23.860
but this time I just...

14:23.862 --> 14:25.294
said it.

14:25.296 --> 14:27.197
It's really not that different
from my poetry performances.

14:28.499 --> 14:31.402
Words are weapons.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.239
'Cause when the poets
take up their arms together,

14:36.241 --> 14:40.175
it's what the, it's what the
mindless troops fear

14:40.177 --> 14:42.879
Yeah, I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna do that.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.550
Sure, sure, we did.

14:46.917 --> 14:47.851
I destroyed
that guy, though.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.553
Don't you think?

14:49.555 --> 14:50.620
You beat him.

14:50.622 --> 14:53.222
I mean, I have a few
notes that I would give you,

14:53.224 --> 14:54.289
here and there.

14:54.291 --> 14:55.158
It's so crazy
seeing people

14:55.160 --> 14:56.558
react like that to poetry!

14:56.560 --> 14:58.660
Writers like you and me,
we submit to journals hoping to

14:58.662 --> 15:00.630
get read by, what,
a hundred subscribers?

15:00.632 --> 15:03.066
What's a good turnout for
one of those slam poetry nights

15:03.068 --> 15:04.266
...a couple dozen at best?

15:04.268 --> 15:05.268
But then you have these guys

15:05.270 --> 15:06.268
who are doing
competitive poetry

15:06.270 --> 15:07.403
...which is what it really is

15:07.405 --> 15:08.972
...and they're
selling out venues.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.039
They're getting
tens of thousands,

15:10.041 --> 15:11.341
even millions of views
on YouTube

15:11.343 --> 15:12.641
and they're
getting paid for it!

15:12.643 --> 15:14.644
This, this is what's happening
in poetry right now.

15:14.646 --> 15:16.313
And instead we're
giving awards to middle-aged

15:16.315 --> 15:20.350
Canadian men publishing
postmodern Inuit fiction.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.784
Not that Qitsualik-Tinsley
isn't fantastic.

15:22.786 --> 15:24.621
Okay, so, what?

15:24.623 --> 15:26.889
You want the Swedish Academy
to start awarding

15:26.891 --> 15:28.957
a Nobel Prize for rap battles?

15:28.959 --> 15:30.327
Well...

15:30.329 --> 15:31.463
no.

15:33.998 --> 15:36.499
But what if I were
to do it for real?

15:36.501 --> 15:38.270
Like, battle and...

15:39.070 --> 15:42.472
Oh, you're serious.

15:42.474 --> 15:43.740
Babe.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.207
I mean, you don't exactly have
a "center stage" personality.

15:46.209 --> 15:47.776
Do you really want to
be another white guy

15:47.778 --> 15:50.279
shamelessly appropriating
African-American culture?

15:50.281 --> 15:52.881
I mean, we don't need
Macklemore, we need Mackle-less.

15:52.883 --> 15:54.284
Yeah.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.584
I mean, you're not like that
other white guy back there.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.553
And that works
in your favor.

15:57.555 --> 15:59.688
I mean, you don't want
to be like those guys.

15:59.690 --> 16:00.890
Trust me.

16:00.892 --> 16:02.294
Yeah.

16:03.395 --> 16:04.026
Yeah.

16:04.028 --> 16:05.429
You're right.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.507
On page four twenty-three,
Dostoevsky has Maximov quote

16:18.509 --> 16:22.511
what he calls
a sarcastic epigram:

16:22.513 --> 16:24.712
You're Sappho,
I'm Phaon, agreed.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.481
But there's one thing still
troubling me:

16:26.483 --> 16:29.351
You don't know
your way to the sea.

16:29.353 --> 16:32.521
Now the poet Batyushkov
is referring to the popular

16:32.523 --> 16:36.792
legend that Sappho,
rejected by her lover Phaon,

16:36.794 --> 16:41.130
killed herself by jumping
from a seaside cliff.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.967
That's actually just
my second favorite

16:44.969 --> 16:46.635
poetic retort of all time.

16:46.637 --> 16:49.840
The first is of course
from LL Cool J,

16:50.908 --> 16:54.010
who was told by a rival rapper
that his tracks were

16:54.012 --> 16:56.444
too commercial
and that quote,

16:56.446 --> 16:59.649
99% of his fans
wear high heels,

16:59.651 --> 17:02.617
whereupon LL responded
with the immortal line:

17:02.619 --> 17:05.854
"Yeah, but 99% of his fans
don't exist."

17:07.959 --> 17:10.626
So let's see your Drakes
and your Nicki Minaj'es drop

17:10.627 --> 17:13.632
a philosophical paradox
to that complex.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.767
Thanks, guys.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.104
Ladies, Seinfeld
is a seminal text,

17:23.106 --> 17:26.008
but for sheer Sartrean dread,
I mean, you can't beat Friends.

17:26.010 --> 17:28.343
Coffee shops and existentialism
just go together.

17:28.345 --> 17:29.445
Right?

17:29.447 --> 17:31.550
I'll see you ladies later.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.351
I was wondering if you had
a minute to talk about

17:36.353 --> 17:37.454
my thesis subject.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.821
What was it...
battle rap, right?

17:38.823 --> 17:39.721
Yeah.

17:39.723 --> 17:41.724
I thought you had
some great material.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.159
You know, I'm just
spitballing here,

17:43.161 --> 17:45.026
but maybe what you should do
is compare modern day rappers

17:45.028 --> 17:47.196
to Ancient Japanese samurai
and their poetic mastery

17:47.198 --> 17:49.131
of haiku and waka.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.132
Wait a minute,
sounds familiar,

17:51.134 --> 17:53.769
is it possible somebody wrote
that paper back in the '90s?

17:53.771 --> 17:55.271
Oh, yeah, that was me.

17:55.273 --> 17:56.405
I know.

17:56.407 --> 17:57.873
But if you look at
the scene going on now,

17:57.875 --> 18:00.008
I really think you'd see that
it's really quite different...

18:00.010 --> 18:05.715
Look, Adam, don't you want to
forge your own path here?

18:05.717 --> 18:07.316
"Who doesn't wish for their
own father's death"

18:07.318 --> 18:08.417
and all that.

18:08.419 --> 18:10.252
Look, be ORIGINAL.

18:10.254 --> 18:12.054
That's the whole point
of the humanities...

18:12.056 --> 18:15.224
you can make up whatever
bullshit you want as long as

18:15.226 --> 18:17.726
you're smart enough
to justify it.

18:17.728 --> 18:18.861
Write about...

18:18.863 --> 18:21.397
the rise of comic book movies
as the ultimate crisis

18:21.399 --> 18:22.998
in the American male psyche.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.199
Actually, don't.

18:24.235 --> 18:26.634
That's good,
I'm keeping it.

18:26.636 --> 18:29.505
Sorry to have
wasted your time.

18:29.507 --> 18:32.440
Hey, Adam... you coming to
the house party tonight?

18:32.442 --> 18:34.209
As long as you wear a
shirt besides that one.

18:34.211 --> 18:35.378
Yeah.
Sure.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.080
Hey, and call your mother.

18:37.082 --> 18:39.049
She worries
about you out here.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.016
Sure thing, Dad.

18:41.018 --> 18:42.518
So he shut you
down entirely?

18:42.520 --> 18:44.119
I don't know if I
would say "shut down."

18:44.121 --> 18:45.255
Really?

18:45.257 --> 18:46.288
Because it sounds
like he heard your idea,

18:46.290 --> 18:47.857
and took a giant shit
all over it,

18:47.859 --> 18:49.859
and then used that shit
to fertilize

18:49.861 --> 18:50.926
a garden growing organic,

18:50.928 --> 18:53.662
certified GMO-free
vegetables which he then ate

18:53.664 --> 18:56.399
and shit all over
your idea again.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.601
Okay, I'll say "shut down."

18:58.603 --> 19:01.103
I know it's intimidating
being the son of probably

19:01.105 --> 19:03.473
the most famous literary critic
in the country,

19:03.475 --> 19:06.476
but you need to
stand up for yourself.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.410
Yeah, you're right.

19:08.412 --> 19:10.179
Although, you should
change your thesis topic.

19:10.181 --> 19:11.648
Yeah, you're right.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.417
I mean, respect your enthusiasm
for researching across

19:14.419 --> 19:16.686
cultural boundaries,
but think about the kind of

19:16.688 --> 19:18.653
culture you're validating.

19:18.655 --> 19:21.122
What if instead you were
to discover and advocate for

19:21.124 --> 19:25.361
the next Angelou or Baldwin,
or even, oh, the next Shakur.

19:25.363 --> 19:26.794
Ooh, like Tupac?

19:26.796 --> 19:27.862
Assata.

19:29.499 --> 19:32.435
Ooof. Can't campus security
do anything about that?

19:32.437 --> 19:35.071
Not unless he's
causing a disturbance.

19:35.073 --> 19:36.971
The best part of full communism
is going to be

19:36.973 --> 19:41.112
when everyone has equal
access to hygiene products.

19:48.385 --> 19:50.486
So Mailer told me that
being a father was

19:50.488 --> 19:52.955
the most rewarding thing
in his life.

19:52.957 --> 19:55.957
And I told him, "You must
have never tried cocaine."

19:59.197 --> 20:01.130
...when you look at a diamond,
you might as well just see

20:01.132 --> 20:04.265
a sad little baby arm,
because that's what it cost.

20:04.267 --> 20:06.968
Adam, you must love
having your dad

20:06.970 --> 20:08.036
work at the university.

20:08.038 --> 20:09.772
Getting to come to
these swanky dinner parties?

20:09.774 --> 20:12.542
Rubbing shoulders
with the Berkeley elite?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.009
It's amazing.

20:14.011 --> 20:15.410
"Love" is a strong word.

20:15.412 --> 20:17.080
As is "Dad."

20:17.082 --> 20:19.114
Bit of a different vibe
than that rap battle

20:19.116 --> 20:20.149
you guys went to, I bet.

20:20.151 --> 20:21.417
Oh, my God, Becky.

20:21.419 --> 20:23.852
You should have heard
the violence and misogyny

20:23.854 --> 20:25.487
that these people
were cheering for,

20:25.489 --> 20:26.855
you would have
been horrified.

20:26.857 --> 20:29.358
What's this I heard about you
battling someone, Adam?

20:29.360 --> 20:30.793
Do tell.

20:30.795 --> 20:33.563
Ugh. This weird guy came up
to us in the parking lot after

20:33.565 --> 20:36.431
and out of nowhere,
he just starts rapping at us.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.735
And Adam
rapped back at him.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.034
And I won!

20:40.036 --> 20:43.105
Just to not leave you
hanging on the outcome.

20:43.107 --> 20:44.506
That is so cool!

20:44.508 --> 20:45.874
I didn't even know
that you rapped!

20:45.876 --> 20:47.011
He doesn't.

20:47.444 --> 20:48.776
I don't.

20:48.778 --> 20:51.147
I just like coming up with
lines for people, for fun.

20:51.149 --> 20:52.415
Ooo, do me!

20:52.417 --> 20:55.484
Like, what you would say to me
if we were battling right now?

20:55.486 --> 20:56.619
I don't think so.

20:56.621 --> 20:58.286
Do me!
You can say anything you want.

20:58.288 --> 21:00.525
- Do me!
- Yeah, do Becky!

21:01.325 --> 21:02.557
Sorry.

21:02.559 --> 21:04.562
There's just nothing to
insult about you guys.

21:05.462 --> 21:06.795
Oookay.

21:06.797 --> 21:08.997
You know, something that
I'll never understand

21:08.999 --> 21:13.201
about this rap stuff
is the "shoot this,

21:13.203 --> 21:18.640
shoot that, shoot the dog,
shoot the grandma."

21:18.642 --> 21:20.642
I just, I mean talk about
contributing to

21:20.644 --> 21:21.776
your own stereotypes.

21:21.778 --> 21:23.711
<i>You're such
a pretentious prick</i>

21:23.713 --> 21:25.448
<i>you have peppermint
excrement /</i>

21:25.450 --> 21:27.749
<i>You stay trolling
all-boy high schools,</i>

21:27.751 --> 21:30.451
<i>that's why you dress up
in this preppy shit"</i>

21:30.453 --> 21:32.755
Jon! That is so racist.

21:32.757 --> 21:35.056
I mean, you can hardly
blame a marginalized group

21:35.058 --> 21:37.627
for their own internalized
white supremacy,

21:37.629 --> 21:40.162
when society has been
actively enforcing it

21:40.164 --> 21:41.030
since its inception.

21:41.032 --> 21:43.533
Well actually,
THAT'S racist.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.067
You're positing a total
lack of self-determination

21:46.069 --> 21:47.069
on the minority's part.

21:47.071 --> 21:49.505
I've always seen
African-American rappers'

21:49.507 --> 21:51.674
hyperbole as self-aware.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.641
Like, we know this is what
white people think of us,

21:53.643 --> 21:55.111
so we're more than happy
to sell it back to you.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.447
<i>"Those are such fucking
hipster glasses /</i>

21:57.449 --> 22:01.783
<i>When you wear them, real life
has an Instagram filter added"</i>

22:01.785 --> 22:03.619
Ugh. So now you're just treating

22:03.621 --> 22:05.621
an entire racialized group
as a monolith.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.622
I mean, that is
WAY more racist.

22:07.624 --> 22:08.591
I can't be racist.

22:08.593 --> 22:09.691
I'm Asian.

22:09.693 --> 22:11.994
Asian people can
definitely be racist.

22:11.996 --> 22:15.031
Racism is the systemic
oppression of people of color.

22:15.033 --> 22:16.498
I'm a person of color.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.100
Ergo, not racist.

22:18.102 --> 22:21.769
<i>"This guy is so hairless,
white and sterile /</i>

22:21.771 --> 22:24.439
<i>You look like a female model
from American Apparel"</i>

22:24.441 --> 22:25.440
Oh, please.

22:25.442 --> 22:27.209
Asians are not
"people of color."

22:27.211 --> 22:28.444
You're more
like off-white.

22:28.446 --> 22:31.179
Okay, um, can we at least
all agree that

22:31.181 --> 22:32.314
THAT was racist?

22:32.316 --> 22:33.282
- Yes.
- Yes.

22:33.284 --> 22:34.751
I'm sorry.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.619
You know what. My inner
proud black woman says,

22:37.621 --> 22:40.592
"Fuck all you bitches."

22:41.793 --> 22:43.691
So wait... Robert can
literally claim to be

22:43.693 --> 22:47.632
a black woman, but you don't
think that that's racist?

22:50.735 --> 22:54.102
He's expressing the
well-known historic affinity

22:54.104 --> 22:56.871
between gay and
black culture, Adam.

22:56.873 --> 22:59.344
Don't be such
a fucking homophobe.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.066
- Hello? <i>
- What it do, cuh?</i>

23:25.068 --> 23:26.369
<i>We out here tryna
book this next event,</i>

23:26.371 --> 23:28.003

<i>the Nerd Who Needs No Revenge

23:34.746 --> 23:35.611
I think you have
the wrong number.

23:35.613 --> 23:36.477
<i>Nah, G.</i>

23:36.479 --> 23:37.846
<i>This is Donnie Narco,</i>

other legal shit.</i>

23:42.319 --> 23:43.819
Is this a prank?

23:43.821 --> 23:45.787
Your exaggerated ebonics
is offensive.

23:45.789 --> 23:47.288
<i>See, you a funny dude.</i>

23:47.290 --> 23:49.091
<i>The homie Behn Grym
said you committed</i>

23:49.093 --> 23:51.361

23:51.363 --> 23:54.796
<i>Some get investigated

23:54.798 --> 23:57.100
Wait. You're actually
from KBL?

23:57.102 --> 23:57.999
Shut the front door!

23:58.001 --> 23:59.802
Adam, shut
the front door, please.

23:59.804 --> 24:02.204
<i>So check it... we got
a tryout card comin' up</i>

24:02.206 --> 24:03.238
<i>in two weeks.</i>

24:03.240 --> 24:05.140
<i>You got a spot if
you want it, man.</i>

24:05.142 --> 24:07.141
<i>Hey, Adam! Ey, man,
the service is nervous...</i>

24:07.143 --> 24:08.977
The banana-kale ice cream
and the chicken-less nuggets

24:08.979 --> 24:10.345
- need to get in the freezer.<i>
- I can't hear you big scrimp.</i>

24:10.347 --> 24:11.413
Sorry, what did you say?

24:11.415 --> 24:12.782
I said, I'm late
to meet Becky...

24:12.784 --> 24:13.681
<i>I said this is about to be
your BIG BREAK, homie...</i>

24:13.683 --> 24:15.150
...and I could use your help.

24:15.152 --> 24:16.252
<i>...your ass could show a little
acknowledgment of that fact.</i>

24:16.254 --> 24:17.351
A little acknowledgment
would be Nice.

24:17.353 --> 24:18.286
Are you even
listening to me?

24:18.288 --> 24:19.388
<i>Listen to me,
you an animal, homie.</i>

24:19.390 --> 24:20.456
I love animals.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.790
Yeah, exactly!

24:21.792 --> 24:23.324
I mean, no senti had being
need live in its own filth

24:23.326 --> 24:25.159
on the way to being
barbarically slaughtered

24:25.161 --> 24:26.894
- just so that we can dose...<i>
- Uh, hello?...</i>

24:26.896 --> 24:28.264
...ourselves in growth hormones.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.899
And the least YOU could do
in order to fulfill...

24:29.901 --> 24:31.033
- <i>YO, Adam!</i>
- ...our commitment to

24:31.035 --> 24:32.700
animal justice
is put the groceries

24:33.871 --> 24:35.971

<i>Aw, man, I knew
I shouldn't've called you</i>

24:42.546 --> 24:43.512
on the trap phone.

24:43.514 --> 24:44.846
Mmmm...

24:44.848 --> 24:46.515
It is amazing what they
can do with tofu these days!

I don't actually
have a rap name.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.399
That's my real name.

I'm like your biggest fan.

26:35.226 --> 26:37.391

it changed the game.

26:37.393 --> 26:38.194
Thanks, bro.

26:38.196 --> 26:39.093
Bring your
equipment to the center,

need it.

26:41.632 --> 26:42.465
My equipment?

26:42.467 --> 26:43.632
Bro, the cameras and shit.

26:43.634 --> 26:45.267
I'm not a cameraman.

26:45.269 --> 26:46.235
I'm a rapper!

26:46.237 --> 26:48.070
Ooooh, rapper.

26:48.072 --> 26:49.971
I have a tryout tonight,
at least I'm supposed to.

26:49.973 --> 26:51.674
I'm super late, Google Maps
got me all screwed up.

26:51.676 --> 26:52.707
Did I miss

26:52.709 --> 26:54.043
Bro, the battles

Ey, what you
white boys call it?

26:59.350 --> 27:00.748
"Hip-hop time," right?

27:00.750 --> 27:02.384
We on "hiphop time"

27:02.386 --> 27:03.619
I like your jacket though.

Don't listen to him, man,
he a hater.

27:17.367 --> 27:18.800
Hey, I LOVED Home Alone.

27:18.802 --> 27:20.101
The way you was
in them traps?

27:20.103 --> 27:21.336
Yeah, we be out there.

27:21.338 --> 27:22.405
Oh!

27:22.407 --> 27:23.338
......lookin' ass.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.974
Why he look like
One Direction if they went

27:25.976 --> 27:28.244
both ways though?

27:28.246 --> 27:31.913
Bro, you listen to
One Direction?

27:31.915 --> 27:34.115
- You really gonna...?
- Oh...

27:34.117 --> 27:36.752
You Earthworm Jim
lookin' ass nigga.

27:36.754 --> 27:37.919
I know you ain't
switchin' sides.

27:37.921 --> 27:38.986
Look at your shit.

27:38.988 --> 27:40.522
I know
you ain't talkin'.

27:40.524 --> 27:42.224
With your LEGO hairline, man.

27:42.226 --> 27:44.025
You can detach
that shit, man.

27:44.027 --> 27:46.561
Bro you know I'm insecure
about that, c'mon.

27:46.563 --> 27:47.763
This your
first battle, huh?

27:47.765 --> 27:48.964
What's your name, homie?

27:48.966 --> 27:49.831
I don't really have one.

27:49.833 --> 27:52.334
I guess it's Adam.

27:52.336 --> 27:54.169
Che Corleone.

27:54.171 --> 27:55.169
Don't trip on
those two, man,

27:55.171 --> 27:56.471
they just love
roasting fools.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.439
Rappers, each other,
whoever's around to get it.

27:58.441 --> 28:00.441
But I'm sensing you
more the type of dude who,

28:00.443 --> 28:04.146
like myself, stays focused
on what's really important.

28:04.148 --> 28:04.713
Battles.

28:04.715 --> 28:05.715
Bitches.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.850
Oh, there are bit...
ladies here?

28:07.852 --> 28:08.749
What d'you mean, man?

28:08.751 --> 28:10.753
It's a great
turnout tonight.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.123
Mmm!

28:14.792 --> 28:15.990
See, those
two over there.

28:15.992 --> 28:17.226
That's what I'm about.

28:17.228 --> 28:18.694
Tryna come spit a little game
with me or what?

28:18.696 --> 28:19.861
You want me to
be your wingman?

28:19.863 --> 28:21.196
Mmm-hmm.

28:21.198 --> 28:22.264
Let me guess... you want me
to talk to the big girl

28:22.266 --> 28:23.632
so you're free to
talk to her friend.

28:23.634 --> 28:24.399
Fuck no, man.

28:24.401 --> 28:25.333
The big girl is MINE.

28:25.335 --> 28:26.200
Fuck outta here.

28:26.202 --> 28:28.336
Yeah, she big,
but she fine as hell.

28:28.338 --> 28:31.005
It takes a real man to
smash a fine fat bitch.

28:31.007 --> 28:33.609
Come on, let's go.

28:33.611 --> 28:34.709
Ey mami.

28:34.711 --> 28:36.445
We just wanted to
personally thank you

28:36.447 --> 28:37.846
for your support.

28:37.848 --> 28:39.948
As two-up-and-coming
battle rappers ourselves,

28:39.950 --> 28:42.684
we appreciate the love.

28:42.686 --> 28:45.687
Oh, so you a battle rapper?

28:45.689 --> 28:46.888
Damn.

28:46.890 --> 28:51.192
Tanya, he say
he's a battle rapper.

28:51.194 --> 28:53.562
You look a little familiar,
come to think of it.

28:53.564 --> 28:54.397
I'm sure I do.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.296
Che Corleone.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.331
Right!

28:56.333 --> 28:57.932
You're the one who
battled Chamberz last event.

28:57.934 --> 28:59.234
Oh, so you
know about me.

28:59.236 --> 29:01.303
I could tell you were
a woman of discerning taste.

29:01.305 --> 29:02.971
Discerning enough to know
that Chamberz

29:02.973 --> 29:05.005
bodied you three-oh.

29:05.007 --> 29:07.175
And the battle before
that you got washed,

29:07.177 --> 29:09.611
and the battle before
that your soul

29:09.613 --> 29:10.778
damn near left the earth.

29:10.780 --> 29:12.648
So how 'bout you spend less
time on your pickup lines

29:12.650 --> 29:15.918
for me and more time on your
lines for your next opponent

29:15.920 --> 29:18.986
before you take your
fourth L in a row.

29:18.988 --> 29:20.354
You lucky
you got an ass,

29:20.356 --> 29:22.957
'cause your battle opinions
are garbage.

29:22.959 --> 29:24.493
Have you considered
jumping into a battle?

29:24.495 --> 29:26.027
I have a feeling
you'd do very well.

29:26.029 --> 29:27.161
Oh, did I forget to mention?

29:27.163 --> 29:29.363
I'm the second match
on the card tonight.

29:29.365 --> 29:32.467
Devine Wright,
nice to meet you.

29:32.469 --> 29:33.467
And she got bars, too?

29:33.469 --> 29:35.838
If you can cook,
I might just be in love.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.376
I can cook you in
the ring, motherfucker!

29:49.486 --> 29:52.053
Aw damn, man,
sorry, homies, my bad.

29:52.055 --> 29:53.956
You know, we runnin'
on that hip-hop time.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.122
What up, what up,
what up.

29:55.124 --> 29:56.925
A'ight, let's shoot

29:58.828 --> 30:01.729

AKA Mister Splash,

your bitch's ass

30:15.978 --> 30:18.147
and won't even tip the glass,
you feel me?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.281
A'ight. Cool, cool.

30:19.283 --> 30:21.583
First up, we got a cool
one-round battle

30:21.585 --> 30:22.817
to kick off these tryouts.

30:22.819 --> 30:25.920
To my right, straight outta
Koreatown, Los Angeles,

30:25.922 --> 30:28.023
give it up for Prospek!

30:28.025 --> 30:29.123
LA, baby!

30:29.125 --> 30:30.726
Shout out to Oakland
though, shout out.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.026
Make some noise, let's go.

30:32.028 --> 30:34.330
And to my left we
got a newcomer on the scene

30:34.332 --> 30:37.166
who I hear is gon' be a real
problem, a real problem...

30:37.168 --> 30:39.066
Adam Murk 'Em!

30:39.068 --> 30:41.003
It's just Adam.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.470
Just Adam?

30:42.472 --> 30:44.206
Oh, okay, cool,
he on that Cher,

30:44.208 --> 30:47.242
Ronaldo, Roseanne type
vibe, I feel you, player.

30:47.244 --> 30:49.277
Since you the new
white boy on the scene,

30:49.279 --> 30:51.211
we gon' show you
a little bit of love.

30:51.213 --> 30:53.515
It's on you Prospek,
get 'im!

30:53.517 --> 30:54.515
YO...

30:54.517 --> 30:58.553
Who the fuck set me up
with this little homo?

30:58.555 --> 31:02.924
This kid looks like he
should be doing Disney promos /

31:02.926 --> 31:06.461
He looks like he loves writing
essays like a prison cholo /

31:06.463 --> 31:08.263
His yearbook photo
looks like the bitch

31:08.265 --> 31:10.501
from the Wendy's logo!

31:13.269 --> 31:15.669
You probably came here
in a Budweiser truck /

31:15.671 --> 31:20.207
With a bumper sticker that
says "I'll die for Trump" /

31:20.209 --> 31:23.044
Basically what I'm saying
is you white as fuck.

31:23.046 --> 31:24.713
Lookin' like
Conan O'Brien's son /

31:24.715 --> 31:27.248
Or the little dude on
the logo for Hawaiian punch

31:27.250 --> 31:28.717
Ha ha, white people!

31:28.719 --> 31:31.119
How the fuck is this white nerd
gonna outsmart this Asian...

31:31.121 --> 31:32.454
what the fuck are you doing? /

31:32.456 --> 31:34.556
You seen Virginia Tech,
we're even better

31:34.558 --> 31:35.623
at school shootings!

31:35.625 --> 31:36.824
He's a ninja!

31:36.826 --> 31:37.758
Finish him!

31:37.760 --> 31:39.026
Don't buy drugs from this man,

31:39.028 --> 31:40.328
just a word of advice /

31:40.330 --> 31:41.929
He's either a cop or reporter...

31:41.931 --> 31:45.767
either way,
he's workin' for Vice /

31:45.769 --> 31:49.505
Actually, if I'm really
squintin', you kinda look like

31:49.507 --> 31:52.640
Tilda Swinton / Actually he
kinda look like one of

31:52.642 --> 31:55.209
them YouTube kids
on Ellen DeGeneres,

31:55.211 --> 31:57.547
when she feelin'
hella generous /

31:59.717 --> 32:02.317
You probably get into fights
like "let me at 'em" /

32:02.319 --> 32:04.953
Actually his butler be fighting
for him like "Let me, Adam"

32:04.955 --> 32:06.921
Ha ha, privilege!

32:06.923 --> 32:08.990
Man, these yuppies
are the worst/

32:08.992 --> 32:11.726
Can you picture 'im in
a Starbucks line with Ugg boots

32:11.728 --> 32:12.995
and a puppy in his purse /

32:12.997 --> 32:14.496
Petting it like, "O-M-G,

32:14.498 --> 32:15.764
you're so fluffy that it hurts"

32:15.766 --> 32:18.167
<i>Puppy in his purse.
Eating dogs.</i>

32:18.169 --> 32:19.368
<i>Got some takeout.</i>

32:19.370 --> 32:21.535
<i>No, that's too racist,
can't be racist.</i>

32:21.537 --> 32:22.236
<i>Disney.</i>

32:22.238 --> 32:26.609
<i>Disney logo, D looks like a G.</i>

32:26.611 --> 32:27.610
<i>Virginia Tech.</i>

32:27.612 --> 32:28.476
<i>That's offensive.</i>

32:28.478 --> 32:30.812
<i>Virginia Tech,
disturbing the dead.</i>

32:30.814 --> 32:32.346
Motherfucker, oh, the irony /

32:32.348 --> 32:34.015
You look like Ron Weasley

32:34.017 --> 32:36.254
but you sound like Hermione /

32:37.555 --> 32:40.988
I'm Asian, so it's only right
that I'm serving this ginger /

32:40.990 --> 32:42.323
I saw this nerd up on Tinder,

32:42.325 --> 32:44.495
he had Little Mermaid
as his picture /

32:47.398 --> 32:49.598
So I don't know if I should
slap you like a bitch

32:49.600 --> 32:51.600
or punch your face like a man /

32:51.602 --> 32:54.201
'Cause I keep switching from
open palm to a fist...

32:54.203 --> 32:58.439
like a white boy
shaking your hand!!!

32:58.441 --> 33:00.242
Time!
I should've saw that coming.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.311
It's gonna be hard
to recover from that one,

33:02.313 --> 33:03.178
but let's see what he got.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.783
It's on Adam, let's get it!

33:10.720 --> 33:13.188
I can't believe this
guy's up here talking about

33:13.190 --> 33:15.556
Virginia Tech /

33:15.558 --> 33:17.359
That's offensive to
the victims and

33:17.361 --> 33:21.766
their families, why are
you disturbing the dead?

33:30.306 --> 33:31.806
You need to stop,

33:31.808 --> 33:35.779
if I did Disney promo,
that means that I popped /

33:42.085 --> 33:44.185
You kinda remind
of the D in Disney...

33:44.187 --> 33:47.422
you look like a G
but you're not

33:54.530 --> 33:56.363
When they talk about
top prospects,

33:56.365 --> 33:58.800
they don't even
call your name out/

33:58.802 --> 34:03.541
I do have a puppy in my bag,
I'm delivering your takeout!

34:09.980 --> 34:11.480
Yo!

34:11.482 --> 34:15.350
You're so Asian you can use a
piece of string as an eye mask/

34:15.351 --> 34:18.118
And when you watch
movies on your iPad

34:18.120 --> 34:20.357
it looks like an iMax /

34:24.092 --> 34:25.393
Beating me?

34:25.395 --> 34:27.362
That's harder than you
trying to score with divas /

34:27.364 --> 34:29.196
Pronouncing "broccoli"
properly or getting

34:29.197 --> 34:31.366
a border visa to North Korea /

34:31.368 --> 34:33.301
Even Asian bitches
won't fuck you,

34:33.303 --> 34:35.237
that means you're hella frail/

34:35.239 --> 34:37.505
Ordering tuna at
sushi's the only time

34:37.507 --> 34:38.438
you get yellow tail

34:38.440 --> 34:40.641
I give that like a five.
Six.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.377
'Cause your dick is so small
you can't tell your cock

34:43.379 --> 34:44.478
from your testicles /

34:44.480 --> 34:45.913
Something's wrong
with your genitals

34:45.915 --> 34:49.283
when your bitch would rather
fuck octopus tentacles /

34:49.284 --> 34:50.985
So, yeah, you're hustlin' weed,

34:50.987 --> 34:52.920
but you're the corner boy
stuck on the streets /

34:52.922 --> 34:57.592
It's bonsai... you just take
a little cut from the trees /

34:57.594 --> 34:59.928
You talk about killing people
in your rhymes

34:59.930 --> 35:01.562
and act like you have
real homies (homicides) /

35:01.564 --> 35:03.297
It's like your anime
girl pillows...

35:03.299 --> 35:06.368
stop pretending
they're real bodies! /

35:06.370 --> 35:07.768
'Cause actual Gs?

35:07.770 --> 35:10.638
You ain't kill none, so shut
the fuck up and chill some /

35:10.640 --> 35:12.239
Just 'cause you look
like Kim Jong-Un

35:12.241 --> 35:14.842
doesn't mean you're ill, son/

35:14.844 --> 35:17.312
And since you
believe in feng shui,

35:17.314 --> 35:19.547
I'm gonna break in
as an intruder at night /

35:19.549 --> 35:21.516
Move your couch an inch
or two to the right

35:21.518 --> 35:24.021
and fucking ruin your life /

35:25.154 --> 35:26.754
Yo...

35:26.756 --> 35:30.558
Your whole crew looks
like an Asian porn star,

35:30.560 --> 35:33.295
when they censor
around where her bush be /

35:33.297 --> 35:37.565
'Cause all I see is a bunch of
squares surrounding this pussy /

35:37.567 --> 35:40.435
This murder's so cold
you can see this man's breath /

35:40.437 --> 35:42.103
I'll kill your supporters
too for sleeping,

35:42.105 --> 35:43.638
that's Korean fan death!/

35:43.640 --> 35:45.038
You'll be either a little boy or

35:45.040 --> 35:46.908
a geriatric for your lifespan/

35:46.910 --> 35:49.344
Oh. You've got egg on your face,
which makes sense

35:49.346 --> 35:52.112
'cause it's shaped like
a fucking fry pan /

35:52.114 --> 35:53.580
See I had a trap set,

35:53.582 --> 35:54.549
you just played into my plan /

35:54.551 --> 35:55.984
'Cause you really don't know

35:55.986 --> 35:58.853
what you're fucking with like
you had a one-night stand...

35:58.855 --> 36:00.825
in Thailand.

36:01.190 --> 36:02.993
FAGGOT!!!

36:06.228 --> 36:08.362
- Who ARE you???
- Respect.

36:08.364 --> 36:10.165
You're crazy.
You did amazing!

36:10.167 --> 36:11.366
Y'all both
KILLED that shit!

36:11.368 --> 36:13.368
Ayo, that was one of
our best tryout

36:13.370 --> 36:14.937
battles like EVER ever.

36:14.939 --> 36:18.739
But coming up, we got an
ALL-FEMALE tryout battle.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.542
Lady Deathstryke verse
Devine Wright coming up,

36:21.544 --> 36:23.243
- ya dig!
- Whoo!

36:23.245 --> 36:25.212
You deserve a round
after that shit.

36:25.214 --> 36:26.248
You nice.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.315
Your hairstyle look
like a gay-ass

36:27.317 --> 36:28.949
Tim Burton character,
but you nice.

36:28.951 --> 36:29.583
Thanks, man!

36:29.585 --> 36:30.951
You are amazing though.

36:30.953 --> 36:32.953
I know everyone online is
gonna say you out-rapped me.

36:32.955 --> 36:35.489
But, oh, I'm so glad my bars
went over so well.

36:35.491 --> 36:37.125
I was worried about
that for a minute.

36:37.127 --> 36:38.159
Whoo!

36:38.161 --> 36:39.761
You had some creative
Asian shit.

36:39.763 --> 36:42.397
Motherfuckers come at me
with hella corny jokes,

36:42.399 --> 36:43.864
but you did 'em well, bro.

36:43.866 --> 36:44.933
You think?

36:44.935 --> 36:46.701
Shit, at least you knew
I was Korean instead of

36:46.703 --> 36:48.002
calling me "chink"
the whole time.

36:48.004 --> 36:50.371
Far as I'm concerned,
that's culturally sensitive

36:50.373 --> 36:51.672
by battle rap standards.

36:51.674 --> 36:53.141
The race angle is just
some shit I gotta deal with,

36:53.143 --> 36:54.576
you know.

36:54.578 --> 36:55.944
Hey, I'm just glad you know
that I'm not racist for real.

36:55.946 --> 36:57.648
I was worried about that.

36:59.181 --> 37:00.785
Thanks, man.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.618
Yo, I got a female
admirer that wants to

37:03.620 --> 37:04.853
make your acquaintance.

37:04.855 --> 37:07.888
This is Adam, he's been
the homie from way back.

37:07.890 --> 37:09.525
I pretty much introduced
him to the game,

37:09.527 --> 37:10.458
you could say.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.493
I really loved your performance.

37:12.495 --> 37:15.163
What was one of
your favorite lines?

37:15.165 --> 37:17.665
I liked when you was making
fun of him for being Asian.

37:17.667 --> 37:20.134
You know, I've never really
been into skinny white boys

37:20.136 --> 37:25.105
before, but maybe you
could open my horizon.

37:25.107 --> 37:25.940
Adam.

37:25.942 --> 37:27.911
Why don't you
give her your phone?

37:28.444 --> 37:29.777
My phone?

37:29.779 --> 37:31.212
Yeah, you give her your phone.

37:31.214 --> 37:32.446
Then she puts
her number in it.

37:32.448 --> 37:34.114
Then you has her number.

37:34.116 --> 37:36.016
That's how this shit works.

37:36.018 --> 37:37.154
Yeah.

37:42.257 --> 37:43.391
Oh, uh...

37:43.393 --> 37:45.763
I actually have to
make a quick phone call.

37:50.033 --> 37:51.502
'Scuse me.

37:52.569 --> 37:54.368
Sorry. I'm sorry.

37:54.370 --> 37:56.270
You're gonna just
leave like that.

37:56.272 --> 37:58.172
After I brought you a girl.
Okay.

37:59.475 --> 38:00.942
Yeah, Lady Deathstryke
won that coin toss,

38:00.944 --> 38:02.509
so it's two minutes
on Devine Wright.

38:02.511 --> 38:03.511
Kick that shit, baby.

38:03.513 --> 38:05.714
I'm a bitch who
loves shopping,

38:05.716 --> 38:08.283
I just copped a magnum
and clips /

38:08.285 --> 38:09.417
No boob job,

38:09.419 --> 38:11.620
but I got some
new cans for this bitch /

38:11.622 --> 38:14.455
You got your name
from a comic...

38:14.457 --> 38:15.757
Lady Deathstryke /

38:15.759 --> 38:17.125
But you the lez type,

38:17.127 --> 38:20.197
those long nails'll
fuck up ya sex life!

38:22.265 --> 38:24.299
Yo, I saw your battle.

38:24.301 --> 38:26.201
That shit was tight.

38:26.203 --> 38:27.505
Keep at it.

38:28.839 --> 38:29.670
Respect.

38:29.672 --> 38:30.971
That shit was crazy!

38:30.973 --> 38:32.975
I ain't never expect bars
like that from a goofy-ass

38:32.977 --> 38:34.042
white boy like you.

38:34.044 --> 38:35.913
Keep up the good work.

38:36.312 --> 38:37.344
Respect!

38:37.346 --> 38:38.279
<i>Adam?</i>

38:38.281 --> 38:39.380
Heeeey, babe.

38:39.382 --> 38:40.448
<i>Where ARE you?</i>

38:40.450 --> 38:42.016
<i>I have been
calling you for hours!</i>

38:42.018 --> 38:44.652
I know, I'm at the library
and my phone was on silent

38:44.654 --> 38:45.721
so I forgot to check it.

38:45.723 --> 38:46.855
I'm really, really...

38:46.857 --> 38:49.860
You a straight killer, cuz!

38:52.763 --> 38:54.230
Respect.

38:54.830 --> 38:55.462
What?

38:55.464 --> 38:57.899
Adam, wooo.

38:57.901 --> 38:59.400
You out there killin' it, huh?

38:59.402 --> 39:00.701
The streets is talkin'.

39:00.703 --> 39:02.203
That audience reaction,

39:02.205 --> 39:04.705
it's like heroin.

39:04.707 --> 39:06.406
Not that I would generalize

39:06.408 --> 39:08.009
about African Americans
and drugs...

39:08.011 --> 39:09.179
Hey!

39:09.879 --> 39:11.612
Keep it down.
I'm sleeping.

39:11.614 --> 39:12.813
Right. Sorry.

39:12.815 --> 39:14.382
<i>They doing this event
in LA next month.</i>

39:14.384 --> 39:15.716
<i>They got this new
crazy promoter</i>

39:15.718 --> 39:17.185
<i>dishing out crazy dough.</i>

39:17.187 --> 39:19.786
<i>And, you know, I'm just
saying if you want to</i>

39:19.788 --> 39:21.156
<i>catch up on some bills.</i>

39:21.158 --> 39:22.089
LA?

39:22.091 --> 39:23.223
For the whole weekend?

39:23.225 --> 39:24.993
<i>Yeah. They'll pick up
your hotel and everything.</i>

39:24.995 --> 39:27.629
<i>You representing for me,
you my little protégé.</i>

39:27.631 --> 39:30.498
<i>So you can't make me
look bad out there.</i>

39:30.500 --> 39:32.132
No pressure, then.

39:32.134 --> 39:33.134
Shhh!!!

39:33.136 --> 39:34.569
Sorry. I have to talk
to him here because

39:34.571 --> 39:35.804
my girlfriend can't know.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.170
Not that it's a gay thing.

39:37.172 --> 39:38.172
Yeah, sure.

39:38.174 --> 39:39.107
I'm in.

39:39.109 --> 39:41.442
Not that it's specifically
NOT a gay thing.

39:41.444 --> 39:42.978
Some of us are
trying to study.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.145
<i>What's up with your thesis
and the questions</i>

39:45.147 --> 39:47.214
<i>that you gotta ask me?</i>

39:47.216 --> 39:49.083
Right. My thesis.

39:49.085 --> 39:51.051
So one thing I've noticed
that changes in the tone of

39:51.053 --> 39:52.587
the N-word is whether
it's preceded by

39:52.589 --> 39:54.489
a possessive pronoun
or an adjective.

39:54.491 --> 39:58.525
For example, "my N-word"
or "her N-word"

39:58.527 --> 40:00.395
- versus ...<i>
- C'mon, bro.</i>

40:00.397 --> 40:03.031
<i>You really gonna hit me with
that "N-word" shit like that?</i>

40:03.033 --> 40:05.132
<i>See, now that makes it
ten times more offensive</i>

40:05.134 --> 40:07.536
<i>'cause you insulting
my intelligence too.</i>

40:07.538 --> 40:09.237
Just say "my nigga."

40:09.239 --> 40:10.337
Are you sure?

40:10.339 --> 40:12.172
I know I checked you before,
but it's a difference

40:12.174 --> 40:14.174
between using the word
and referencing the word.

40:14.176 --> 40:16.511
You gotta use the word like
how Obama said it.

40:16.513 --> 40:17.777
Can't be using it
like how all them

40:17.779 --> 40:19.614
other presidents said it.

40:19.616 --> 40:20.882
Alright.

40:20.884 --> 40:22.750
What I've noticed is
the difference between using

40:22.752 --> 40:24.254
a possessive pronoun like...

40:27.690 --> 40:30.759
- "My nigga" ...<i>
- There you go.</i>

40:30.761 --> 40:36.431
...or "her nigga" versus an
adjective like "this nigga"

40:36.433 --> 40:38.900
or a "funny..."

40:38.902 --> 40:41.805
nig... ga.

40:42.772 --> 40:44.205
<i>Okay, wait,
wait, wait, wait,</i>

40:44.207 --> 40:45.306
<i>come on.</i>

40:45.308 --> 40:46.774
<i>Are you trying to learn
how to use these phrases</i>

40:46.776 --> 40:47.708
<i>in a rap battle?</i>

40:47.710 --> 40:49.844
Yes. No. Uh...

40:49.846 --> 40:50.511
Yes?

40:50.513 --> 40:51.714
<i>This nigga.</i>

40:58.120 --> 41:01.188
Wow, they have cashew-cheddar
nutloaf quesadillas...

41:01.190 --> 41:02.556
no cheese OR bread!

41:02.558 --> 41:05.094
Adam, this place is perfect.

41:06.330 --> 41:07.261
What's the occasion?

41:07.263 --> 41:08.362
Actually, there's something
I was hoping

41:08.364 --> 41:09.263
to talk to you about.

41:09.265 --> 41:10.332
Namaste!

41:10.334 --> 41:12.333
I'm feeling really good
energy from this table.

41:12.335 --> 41:13.701
Are you ready to order?

41:13.703 --> 41:16.337
Maybe a juice to energize,
relax, detox?

41:16.339 --> 41:17.906
- If I could just have a min...
- I would love

41:17.908 --> 41:19.806
a Carrot-Ginger juice,
but could you substitute

41:19.808 --> 41:21.308
kale for the spinach,
beet for the celery,

41:21.310 --> 41:22.976
mango for the apple,
lime for the lemon,

41:22.978 --> 41:26.047
parsley for the ginger,
and cucumber for the carrot?

41:26.049 --> 41:27.515
If it's not too
much trouble.

41:27.517 --> 41:29.551
Fuck yeah.

41:29.553 --> 41:32.120
So, what I need to
talk to you about...

41:32.122 --> 41:33.687
- it's something that I did.
- You fucked someone.

41:33.689 --> 41:34.688
Whoa, no!
It's nothing like that.

41:34.690 --> 41:36.190
You fucked someone,
didn't you?

41:36.192 --> 41:36.824
I knew it.

41:36.826 --> 41:38.592
I just did a rap battle.

41:38.594 --> 41:40.694
WHAT?!!!

41:40.696 --> 41:42.763
It's really not a big deal.
Really.

41:42.765 --> 41:44.098
It's just something
I wanted to do,

41:44.100 --> 41:45.699
and I did well enough that
I actually have another one

41:45.701 --> 41:46.967
booked in LA next month.

41:46.969 --> 41:48.803
So I was thinking
we should go together.

41:48.805 --> 41:50.304
Like a fun weekend trip.

41:50.306 --> 41:51.875
Like a fun weekend trip.

41:52.576 --> 41:54.408
Doesn't that sound...

41:54.410 --> 41:55.509
- fun?
- Mmm...

41:55.511 --> 41:57.212
I'll tell you what it sounds
like: it sounds like you

41:57.214 --> 41:59.846
going behind my BACK
and doing the one thing

41:59.848 --> 42:01.815
we explicitly AGREED
you weren't going to do,

42:01.817 --> 42:04.585
not to mention
the misogynistic,

42:04.587 --> 42:06.721
homophobic, ableist,
transphobic...

42:06.723 --> 42:08.121
<i>Saying rap music
glorifies violence.</i>

42:08.123 --> 42:10.024
<i>Don't you think
that's a little...</i>

42:10.026 --> 42:11.560
<i>racist?</i>

42:11.562 --> 42:12.861
<i>Reductivist.</i>

42:12.863 --> 42:14.029
<i>Colonialist.</i>

42:14.031 --> 42:15.395
<i>Don't you think that's
a little bit...</i>

42:15.397 --> 42:17.431
Don't you think that sounds
a little bit colonialist?

42:17.433 --> 42:18.966
EXCUSE me?

42:18.968 --> 42:21.069
I mean, you're passing
judgment on a grassroots

42:21.071 --> 42:23.571
African-American culture
based on your own privileged

42:23.573 --> 42:24.906
white perspective.

42:24.908 --> 42:27.975
That just seems like a
colonialist critique rather than

42:27.977 --> 42:31.478
honestly engaging with them
on their own terms.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.880
You know, that is why
I didn't tell you about

42:33.882 --> 42:35.083
the battle in the first place.

42:35.085 --> 42:41.422
I knew you being there
would be... problematic.

42:41.424 --> 42:43.859
Are you saying that if I
don't go to LA with you

42:43.861 --> 42:46.728
and support you in battling,
it makes me racist?

42:46.730 --> 42:47.931
Yep.

42:49.598 --> 42:51.533
I never thought
about it that way.

42:51.535 --> 42:54.301
That is because there are
systems in place that keep

42:54.303 --> 42:55.569
you thinking that way.

42:55.571 --> 42:57.304
Wow.
I mean you're right.

42:57.306 --> 43:00.107
I have been so caught up
in my own privilege that

43:00.109 --> 43:02.576
I never thought to examine
battling from an authentic

43:02.578 --> 43:03.678
contextual point of view.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.245
We all slip up sometimes.

43:05.247 --> 43:06.147
Okay.

43:06.149 --> 43:09.283
So help me understand. Like...

43:09.285 --> 43:11.618
What's an example of
a line you would say?

43:11.620 --> 43:13.187
What's something
you would say to me?

43:13.189 --> 43:14.656
I don't think
that's a good idea.

43:14.658 --> 43:16.623
I'm trying to
understand here.

43:16.625 --> 43:18.158
I am trying to engage.

43:18.160 --> 43:21.830
Adam, if you love me,
you'll insult me in a rhyme.

43:21.832 --> 43:23.797
Right now.

43:23.799 --> 43:25.966
Okay, okay.

43:25.968 --> 43:30.937
Uh, okay, how about this...

43:30.939 --> 43:33.674
I'm just here to respect
women and treat them equally /

43:33.676 --> 43:35.743
I took you to
a vegan eatery,

43:35.745 --> 43:38.478
why would you have
some beef with me?

43:38.480 --> 43:40.181
Oh, my God, that's so good!

43:40.183 --> 43:41.919
Go again.

43:44.252 --> 43:48.089
You're crunchy granola, I can
tell by your pungent aroma /

43:48.091 --> 43:49.790
You smell
like swamp water,

43:49.792 --> 43:51.192
I'm worried you've
been fuckin' with Yoda.

43:51.194 --> 43:53.395
And your whole fuckin' style
is more tasteless

43:53.397 --> 43:54.261
than this tofu /

43:54.263 --> 43:55.562
The way I killed you
with rhymes

43:55.564 --> 43:56.730
I'm like your deadbeat mother,

43:56.732 --> 43:58.431
I diss-owned you!

43:58.433 --> 44:00.536
What the fuck, Adam?!!!

44:03.772 --> 44:04.705
Get the fuck out.

44:04.707 --> 44:05.772
Oh, You don't understand,

44:05.774 --> 44:07.174
she actually asked me
to say that.

44:07.176 --> 44:08.743
Well, not that exactly, but
we were just joking around.

44:08.745 --> 44:10.111
I was actually coming up
with hypothetical

44:10.113 --> 44:11.379
rap battle lines to say to her.

44:11.381 --> 44:12.846
You know, like if I looked
at your shirt and said

44:12.848 --> 44:14.348
something like,
"It's funny you have a shirt

44:14.350 --> 44:16.384
with Bob Marley, because
your pussy hair looks like

44:16.386 --> 44:18.018
a cross between him
and Rob Zombie."

44:18.020 --> 44:19.219
Okay, bad example.

44:19.221 --> 44:20.489
Chris!

44:24.127 --> 44:26.296
I was just trying
to be a good boyfriend!

44:31.801 --> 44:33.067
Hmm.

44:33.069 --> 44:34.134
I'm sorry about this place.

44:34.136 --> 44:35.803
It's not exactly
what I expected.

44:35.805 --> 44:36.870
And I'm sorry
about everything.

44:36.872 --> 44:37.904
Okay, Adam.

44:37.906 --> 44:40.107
You've been
apologizing for days.

44:40.109 --> 44:42.743
You apologized the whole
six-hour drive here.

44:42.745 --> 44:45.145
Could you just not,
anymore?

44:45.147 --> 44:47.515
I still agreed
to come, didn't I?

44:47.517 --> 44:50.018
Now let's just
try to have

44:50.020 --> 44:51.819
a culturally enriching
experience.

44:57.160 --> 45:01.194
Oh, shit, is THIS albino
mole rat lookin' motherfucker.

45:01.196 --> 45:02.931
They got
everybody in this telly.

45:02.933 --> 45:04.431
Look, I gotta see you later,
mami, because I gotta

45:04.433 --> 45:05.935
talk to my boy right now.

45:06.868 --> 45:07.969
You good?

45:07.971 --> 45:09.770
- Ride down was smooth?
- Yeah.

45:09.772 --> 45:11.505
Let go, let go.

45:11.507 --> 45:12.607
How you doing?

45:12.609 --> 45:15.109
I watched your Prospek
battle back like ten times.

45:15.111 --> 45:16.611
When you said "your chick
would rather fuck

45:16.613 --> 45:18.580
octopus tentacles"... YOOOO.

45:18.582 --> 45:19.547
That was COLD.

45:19.549 --> 45:20.614
Thanks, man.

45:20.616 --> 45:22.116
Hey, who was the girl?

45:22.118 --> 45:23.518
Uh, she's just
some Tinder bitch.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.553
I had to get the good luck dome
before the battle goes on,

45:25.555 --> 45:26.554
you know what I'm saying.

45:26.556 --> 45:27.955
I mean, it would've been
better luck if it was

45:27.957 --> 45:30.625
from Bae, but she playin'.

45:30.627 --> 45:32.625
Oh, uh...

45:32.627 --> 45:33.428
Devine!

45:33.430 --> 45:34.862
Have you met
my girlfriend Maya?

45:34.864 --> 45:36.163
Maya, this is Devine Wright.

45:36.165 --> 45:37.765
A very talented
female battler.

45:37.767 --> 45:39.000
Maya.
What's good?

45:39.002 --> 45:40.167
Oh, awesome!

45:40.169 --> 45:41.402
You know, it's really
amazing to meet you.

45:41.404 --> 45:42.837
I really respect
what you're doing,

45:42.839 --> 45:43.904
breaking ground as a woman

45:43.906 --> 45:46.140
in such
a male-dominated pursuit.

45:46.142 --> 45:47.975
What does me being a woman
got to do with it?

45:47.977 --> 45:50.612
I ain't spittin' rhymes
out of my vagina.

45:50.614 --> 45:53.181
Wooo. We're about to
head down to the venue.

45:53.183 --> 45:54.714
You wanna stash
your bags and follow?

45:54.716 --> 45:56.452
Let's do it.

46:00.589 --> 46:02.459
I guess it's upstairs?

46:06.562 --> 46:07.663
That ain't up.

46:10.399 --> 46:13.967
Yo! All my life I dreamed
of fame and success.

46:13.969 --> 46:16.707
Finally, we made it.

46:19.643 --> 46:20.808
Classic battle shit.

46:20.810 --> 46:21.975
Kid gets a bunch of money,

46:21.977 --> 46:23.643
decides he wants to
be a promoter now.

46:23.645 --> 46:25.547
Spends everything he
got on getting some names,

46:25.549 --> 46:28.015
then puts us up against
a buncha bums

46:28.017 --> 46:29.750
at an event no one comes to.

46:29.752 --> 46:31.085
Man, who cares?

46:31.087 --> 46:32.252
I'm from North Richmond,
as long as I'm getting paid

46:32.254 --> 46:34.120
I'll battle in a fuckin'
sewage drain.

46:34.122 --> 46:35.255
Y'all a buncha divas.

46:35.257 --> 46:38.194
I know.
Men, right?

46:41.698 --> 46:43.033
Is that Megaton?

46:44.767 --> 46:45.799
What is he doing here?

46:45.801 --> 46:47.033
It's his city.

46:47.035 --> 46:48.402
But why is he rapping here?

46:48.404 --> 46:50.103
They musta paid him
a couple stacks

46:50.105 --> 46:51.239
more than the rest of us.

46:51.241 --> 46:54.007
What I'm wondering is,
who is THAT nigga?

46:54.009 --> 46:55.241
That looks like...

46:55.243 --> 46:57.678
I think that's
the dude I'm battling.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.712
Shiiiiit.

46:58.714 --> 47:00.147
He's rocking the groom tux.

47:00.149 --> 47:01.915
He about to get up there
and marry your ass.

47:01.917 --> 47:03.283
He looks like my
dad's wedding photo.

47:03.285 --> 47:04.817
He look like
he dug up Prince

47:04.819 --> 47:07.221
and stole the nigga suit.

47:07.223 --> 47:09.158
He surely stole
the nigga suit.

47:10.993 --> 47:12.092
What's good, y'all,

47:12.094 --> 47:13.460
it's your host
Freddie Hustle.

47:13.462 --> 47:17.065
We about to get it cracking
for the inaugural event of

47:17.067 --> 47:18.466
Freddie Hustle
Entertainment.

47:18.468 --> 47:20.201
Let's get this
battle started.

47:20.203 --> 47:23.136
Battler to my RIGHT!

47:23.138 --> 47:27.542
I said YO... ya mom's pussy
got one star

47:27.544 --> 47:29.413
on her Yelp reviews!

47:30.312 --> 47:32.580
I didn't
even come to battle,

47:32.582 --> 47:36.382
I just have a question that
I wanna ask of my girl /

47:36.384 --> 47:40.353
Will you do me
the honor of making me

47:40.355 --> 47:43.591
the happiest man in the world?

47:43.593 --> 47:46.928
I'll make him double up in
the middle like a tummy tuck /

47:46.930 --> 47:48.596
The shotty'll blow
his guts out,

47:48.598 --> 47:51.165
that's a stomach pump...

47:51.167 --> 47:53.734
- Stomach pump.
- Mmm-mmm...

47:53.736 --> 47:55.636
Stomach pump.

47:55.638 --> 47:57.406
Wait, I got it...

47:58.073 --> 47:59.973
Stomach pump.

47:59.975 --> 48:01.808
I'll probably lift him
off his feet

48:01.810 --> 48:03.310
if I aim my Glock /

48:03.312 --> 48:05.712
<i>And that's the first time
a black guy</i>

48:05.714 --> 48:09.049
<i>will get raised by pops!</i>

48:09.051 --> 48:11.919
I just want you to be
my boo, K?

48:11.921 --> 48:14.654
I even got you this bouquet /

48:14.656 --> 48:18.659
You like guns, we can go
shopping together,

48:18.661 --> 48:21.395
I'll buy my boo Ks.

48:21.397 --> 48:25.333
And your girl uses Dijon Mustard
when she eat her boogies /

48:25.335 --> 48:28.201
I'll show up
at ya grandma's open casket

48:28.203 --> 48:31.371
and give that bitch
a nuggie!

48:32.709 --> 48:34.708
His sister got mad kids,

48:34.710 --> 48:36.109
just had another couple /

48:36.111 --> 48:38.478
And every time he's like,
"Damn...

48:38.480 --> 48:40.816
well, I'll be a
monkey's uncle."

48:42.250 --> 48:44.217
And the shotty'll blow
his guts out,

48:44.219 --> 48:45.953
that's a stomach pump /

48:45.955 --> 48:47.420
And your girl's
memory foam mattress

48:47.422 --> 48:50.759
remembers that
she's a fuckin' slut!

48:51.928 --> 48:54.295
- Fuck, what was my next line?
- Fuck outta here!

48:54.297 --> 48:55.828
Alright, rapper to my LEFT!

48:55.830 --> 48:57.198
Let's go, get 'em.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.801
You a comedian
like John Belushi,

48:59.803 --> 49:00.801
Chris Farley.

49:00.803 --> 49:01.703
Robin Williams...

49:01.705 --> 49:03.170
If you haven't
figured it out by now /

49:03.172 --> 49:04.571
Save us all some time

49:04.573 --> 49:07.373
and kill
yourself RIGHT NOW!

49:07.375 --> 49:10.178
You ain't gettin' married,
you gettin' buried,

49:10.180 --> 49:12.480
but you still dressed
suitable, nigga /

49:12.482 --> 49:16.116
I'll let each gun ring twice...

49:16.118 --> 49:18.152
that's Four Weddings
and a Funeral, nigga!

49:18.154 --> 49:20.520
This dude forgot all
the rhymes he studied,

49:20.522 --> 49:23.257
call him Sway, he don't know
the answers /

49:23.259 --> 49:25.091
He's like
a kid's warning label -

49:25.093 --> 49:26.661
this toy is
a choking hazard.

49:26.663 --> 49:30.130
So you wanna talk
that racist shit?

49:30.132 --> 49:34.000
I know your girl
and I'm pimpin' the thot /

49:34.002 --> 49:37.370
It's a reverse
slavery auction,

49:37.372 --> 49:40.607
I put YOUR bitch
on the block!

49:40.609 --> 49:42.976
Shoot him, then check
for the body shakes,

49:42.978 --> 49:45.312
that's how you can tell that
death's gripped 'em /

49:45.314 --> 49:49.149
It's like a good-ass orgasm,

49:49.151 --> 49:51.652
one bust will have
your legs twitchin'

49:51.654 --> 49:54.788
You're so fat
that you ran out of breath

49:54.790 --> 49:58.458
downloading the app
to count your steps /

49:58.460 --> 50:00.761
If you were on house arrest,
you'd have to take

50:00.763 --> 50:04.334
walking breaks to give
your house a rest.

50:05.567 --> 50:07.167
If he was really provokin' /

50:07.169 --> 50:09.036
He woulda seen
all types a colors,

50:09.038 --> 50:12.272
'cause for the
kill-I'da-scoped-him/...

50:12.274 --> 50:14.310
Get off the stage.

50:14.843 --> 50:15.743
Get it?

50:15.745 --> 50:18.815
All types a colors,
KALEIDOSCOPED HIM?

50:19.415 --> 50:20.880
Yeah, see, y'all get it.

50:20.882 --> 50:21.815
TIME!

50:21.817 --> 50:22.683
Time.

50:22.685 --> 50:23.484
Time!

50:23.486 --> 50:24.487
TIME!!!

50:29.792 --> 50:32.460
- Yo, yo, check it.
- Shut the fuck up!

50:32.462 --> 50:34.995
You little squirmy
little Reddit blogger/

50:34.997 --> 50:36.596
Another Eminem impostor
who refers

50:36.598 --> 50:38.565
to Elton John as
his second father/

50:38.567 --> 50:40.967
Bob Saget, Rick Moranis,
Kelly Osbourne,

50:40.969 --> 50:42.536
white trash genetic monster /

50:42.538 --> 50:43.937
Probably conceived
in the back of

50:43.939 --> 50:44.938
a Led Zeppelin concert /

50:44.940 --> 50:47.507
If Harry Potter had sex
with Jeffrey Dahmer,

50:47.509 --> 50:49.310
you'd be their
lesbian daughter! /

50:49.312 --> 50:51.511
The fuck are you,
a little fuckin' state prison

50:51.513 --> 50:52.879
fuckin' rape victim?/

50:52.881 --> 50:54.915
He's the new face of racism /

50:54.917 --> 50:57.051
I'm surprised he didn't
show up here today with

50:57.053 --> 50:58.486
a slave with him
chained to him /

50:58.488 --> 51:00.520
He hates African-American
culture 'cause

51:00.522 --> 51:01.821
he was raised different /

51:01.823 --> 51:04.558
He hates Clinton, Abe Lincoln,
pretty much anybody

51:04.560 --> 51:05.792
that can relate with 'em /

51:05.794 --> 51:07.895
Except Blake Griffin...
he feels a little bit

51:07.897 --> 51:10.565
more safe with him 'cause
they share the same pigment /

51:10.567 --> 51:13.266
Bitch, hip-hop has
been for minorities,

51:13.268 --> 51:15.335
it's never been for
you geeky asses /

51:15.337 --> 51:16.703
Matter of fact, what are these,

51:16.705 --> 51:18.272
your little fuckin'
reading glasses

51:18.274 --> 51:20.373
you need for
your English classes? /

51:20.375 --> 51:23.310
Man, gimme that shit...
I'll stomp these into pieces

51:23.312 --> 51:24.545
and fragments /

51:24.547 --> 51:25.946
And now you can keep them,

51:25.948 --> 51:27.080
he can have this /

51:27.082 --> 51:28.915
Now you get to complete
your dream

51:28.917 --> 51:30.551
of being this genius math whiz /

51:30.553 --> 51:32.620
'Cause everything you see's
in fractions! /

51:32.622 --> 51:34.989
Now get the fuck outta here,
you little fuckin'

51:34.991 --> 51:37.627
dweeby FAGGOT!

51:38.259 --> 51:39.359
Man, y'all see that shit?

51:39.361 --> 51:41.094
He made that kid
cry, like, tears.

51:41.096 --> 51:42.261
That's not right.

51:42.263 --> 51:45.098
Fuck a battle career,
he ended dude LIFE.

51:45.100 --> 51:47.134
He gon' need a new
face transplant

51:47.136 --> 51:48.801
and new social security number.

51:48.803 --> 51:49.804
Megaton.

51:49.806 --> 51:52.438
First battle rapper
quoted in a suicide note.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.274
That whole verse was CRAZY!

51:54.276 --> 51:56.710
Ow! Adam, I'm right here!

51:56.712 --> 51:57.377
Oh, hey, babe.

51:57.379 --> 52:00.614
Wasn't that unbelievable?

52:00.616 --> 52:03.018
Hey, can you get me
a drink from the bar?

52:04.754 --> 52:08.054
Yo, Mega one of the all-time
greats of this shit.

52:08.056 --> 52:09.324
Uh, come on.

52:09.326 --> 52:10.891
Eminem is the greatest
battle rapper of all time.

52:10.893 --> 52:12.692
I'm sorry, fellas.

52:12.694 --> 52:15.027
I forgot it's a white boy
in our presence,

52:15.029 --> 52:18.299
so, you know, we contractually
obligated to mention Eminem.

52:18.301 --> 52:19.400
Hold up. Hold on.

52:19.402 --> 52:21.268
How your man supposed to
be the greatest

52:21.270 --> 52:24.203
and he get bodied
in his own fictional movie?

52:24.205 --> 52:25.640
Lotto washed him in 8 Mile.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.408
Didn't Lickety Split
get him too?

52:27.410 --> 52:29.342
Then he go body himself
for a whole round,

52:29.344 --> 52:30.544
you know what I'm saying.

52:30.546 --> 52:32.245
Poppa Doc ain't choke...
he just knew it was over

52:32.247 --> 52:33.913
so he walked off.

52:33.915 --> 52:34.949
Em took his own L.

52:34.951 --> 52:36.482
Plus how you
supposed to be the greatest

52:36.484 --> 52:38.451
when your video director
some Filipino nigga

52:38.453 --> 52:41.321
making gay-ass art films
for your joints, bruh?

52:41.323 --> 52:42.892
Um...

52:44.928 --> 52:46.694
- two.
- It's not 1992.

52:46.696 --> 52:48.495
Em's skill transcends race.

52:48.497 --> 52:50.063
You talking about Em?

52:50.065 --> 52:51.899
He's the fucking GOAT, man.

52:51.901 --> 52:54.502
You're right, he's better
at putting words together

52:54.504 --> 52:56.270
than all of
these black guys.

52:56.272 --> 52:57.571
Go away.

52:57.573 --> 52:59.605
Yo. You said some WILD shit
up there, homie.

52:59.607 --> 53:01.509
Fuck outta here, man,
this is battle rap.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.409
I could diss
Asians, Mexicans,

53:03.411 --> 53:04.277
any other race.

53:04.279 --> 53:05.379
Why not blacks?

53:05.381 --> 53:08.181
I'm just trying to
fight for equality.

53:08.183 --> 53:10.183
Hey, he got a point, bruh.

53:10.185 --> 53:11.384
What?

53:11.386 --> 53:14.187
Plus I thought
that shit was hilarious, man!

53:14.189 --> 53:16.223
I love this nigga!

53:16.225 --> 53:19.259
Man! Hey, look. The way you
keep it real with how you feel,

53:19.261 --> 53:20.361
I feel that!

53:20.363 --> 53:23.163
Yo, any of y'all seen
a hotel key card

53:23.165 --> 53:24.297
laying around anywhere?

53:24.299 --> 53:25.966
I can't remember
where I put it.

53:25.968 --> 53:27.967
What hotel's it for?

53:27.969 --> 53:29.738
I can't remember.

53:31.073 --> 53:33.540
Fuck that, man.

53:33.542 --> 53:35.109
Why don't you get
you're your ass outta here.

53:35.111 --> 53:36.509
Damn.

53:36.511 --> 53:38.145
This shit
messy as fuck, bro.

53:38.147 --> 53:39.346
Yo, let's peel out.

53:39.348 --> 53:42.518
I got a dope food spot
I want to take y'all to.

53:43.051 --> 53:43.850
ADAM!

53:43.852 --> 53:45.284
I want to go back
to the hotel now.

53:45.286 --> 53:46.587
Okay.

53:46.589 --> 53:47.721
I think some of the guys were
gonna grab some food

53:47.723 --> 53:49.323
but I could drop you off
on the way.

53:49.325 --> 53:50.357
Okay.

53:50.359 --> 53:51.792
I want you to think
really hard

53:51.794 --> 53:53.426
about what the best thing
to do is.

53:53.428 --> 53:55.197
And then I want
you to do it.

53:58.234 --> 53:59.900
So you dropped
your girl off?

53:59.902 --> 54:02.505
She dropped me.

54:03.705 --> 54:05.438
She not takin' you back?

54:05.440 --> 54:06.774
In more or less those words.

54:06.776 --> 54:08.074
You did the right
thing, bro.

54:08.076 --> 54:09.210
Yeah.

54:09.212 --> 54:10.243
Yeah, it's fine.

54:10.245 --> 54:12.179
I'm sure we'll be...

54:12.181 --> 54:13.513
fine.

54:13.515 --> 54:15.181
Hey, can I drop this
in someone's car?

54:15.183 --> 54:17.150
Maya was my ride home.

54:17.152 --> 54:18.486
I got you, dog.

54:18.488 --> 54:20.756
Just know you gon' be
designated driver, though.

54:22.892 --> 54:24.991
Yo, the homie just texted me
that Megaton is

54:24.993 --> 54:26.661
having an after party
at the crib later.

54:26.663 --> 54:29.261
Shit's gon' be LIT.

54:29.263 --> 54:32.165
How's that, how's that.

54:32.167 --> 54:33.500
Wooo!

54:33.502 --> 54:36.238
White folks drivin' us
around tonight!

54:51.187 --> 54:52.652
Let me get this
shit straight.

54:52.654 --> 54:56.522
We in LA and the Mexican
takes us to a sushi joint.

54:56.524 --> 54:57.591
I'm with D.

54:57.593 --> 54:58.725
You wrong for this one.

54:58.727 --> 55:02.629
First off, I'm Ecuadorian,
motherfuckers.

55:02.631 --> 55:08.136
Second, the chef here
came highly recommended.

55:10.372 --> 55:11.638
No way.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.774
I take that back...
you DEAD wrong for this one.

55:13.776 --> 55:16.275
My LA connect saw him working
here and told me about it.

55:16.277 --> 55:18.781
I had to come
see for myself.

55:19.781 --> 55:21.580
Okay, what can I get
y'all started with?

55:21.582 --> 55:23.817
I got a quick question. Um...

55:23.819 --> 55:26.754
I heard you're so Asian
when you watch movies

55:26.756 --> 55:28.888
on your iPad
it looks like an IMAX.

55:28.890 --> 55:30.524
Can you confirm?

55:30.526 --> 55:32.560
Aw, HELL nah.

55:32.562 --> 55:33.960
You should be proud.

55:33.962 --> 55:36.163
You dressed like you about
to take your yellow belt test,

55:36.165 --> 55:37.031
it's your lucky day.

55:37.033 --> 55:38.632
Nah, he look good
in his uniform.

55:38.634 --> 55:40.299
It really brings out his eyes.

55:40.301 --> 55:41.801
Man, FUCK all a y'all.

55:41.803 --> 55:43.237
What are you doing
making sushi, anyway?

55:43.239 --> 55:44.370
You're Korean.

55:44.372 --> 55:45.571
There ain't enough Japanese
to keep up with how much

55:45.573 --> 55:46.841
white people love this shit.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.808
Half of the sushi joints
here are owned by Koreans.

55:48.810 --> 55:50.444
We just pretend
to be Japanese.

55:50.446 --> 55:51.844
Y'all too ignorant to
know the difference.

55:51.846 --> 55:54.649
You a walking Asian
stereotype, bro.

55:54.651 --> 55:56.683
You probably fought like
fifty ninjas on the way here.

55:56.685 --> 55:58.784
Drove a Civic and
drift the whole way.

55:58.786 --> 56:01.187
It must be hella hard to
write the customer's checks

56:01.189 --> 56:02.723
in that crazyass calligraphy.

56:02.725 --> 56:03.991
Yeah, that's true.

56:03.993 --> 56:05.391
What do you do after work...
go home and pretend

56:05.393 --> 56:07.096
to rape your grandma?

56:09.464 --> 56:10.933
YO.

56:11.667 --> 56:13.866
What the fuck, bro?!!

56:13.868 --> 56:15.669
You know, 'cause
you're Korean,

56:15.671 --> 56:17.538
but you're pretending
to be Japanese.

56:17.540 --> 56:19.573
And Japan occupied Korea
for a long time

56:19.575 --> 56:21.408
and they committed
a lot of atrocities...

56:21.410 --> 56:22.708
I thought we were roasting him.

56:22.710 --> 56:25.245
We WAS talkin' some
ignorant Asian shit.

56:25.247 --> 56:28.348
Then you went and put all
this real history into it.

56:28.350 --> 56:29.783
Not cool, bro.

56:29.785 --> 56:32.419
It'd be best for
you all to leave.

56:32.421 --> 56:33.487
Sensei, these are my friends.

56:33.489 --> 56:34.855
We're just joking around.

56:34.857 --> 56:35.489
"Sensei?"

56:35.491 --> 56:37.257
Yo, Mister Miyagi IS real!

56:37.259 --> 56:39.960
Yo, Hollywood owes you
all kinds of royalties, bro.

56:39.962 --> 56:41.895
Come call me,
talk to my face.

56:41.897 --> 56:42.862
Yo.

56:42.864 --> 56:45.565
This old-ass Hong Kong
Phooey motherfucker

56:45.567 --> 56:47.199
really trying to start
some shit with me...

56:47.201 --> 56:48.268
Oh, shit.

56:48.270 --> 56:49.303
He kicked my face!

56:49.305 --> 56:50.237
We should get
him out of here.

56:50.239 --> 56:51.205
He kicked me in
the motherfuckin' face!

56:51.207 --> 56:52.406
Let me at him.

56:52.408 --> 56:53.873
- You want him?
- No, no, no...

56:53.875 --> 56:56.879
Get yo' ass out.

56:59.147 --> 57:01.147
An old martial arts master
doing a spin kick

57:01.149 --> 57:02.949
in the middle of
a sushi restaurant?

57:02.951 --> 57:04.018
REALLY?

57:04.020 --> 57:05.351
Do you even know how much
of a fucking stereotype

57:05.353 --> 57:06.420
you made us look like?

57:06.422 --> 57:09.257
You set Asians
back a hundred years!

57:12.261 --> 57:15.763
Che was right, Mega
lives in the hood for real.

57:15.765 --> 57:17.364
Are you sure
this is the hood?

57:17.366 --> 57:18.632
These houses are all really big.

57:18.634 --> 57:20.400
And they have lawns.

57:20.402 --> 57:22.739
You really from
New York, huh?

57:31.046 --> 57:33.346
Fuck is this,
the Captain Planet reunion?

57:33.348 --> 57:34.580
Sup, Che.

57:34.582 --> 57:35.516
Prospek.

57:35.518 --> 57:36.482
Baby girl.

57:36.484 --> 57:38.051
Behn Grym,
what's good, homie.

57:38.053 --> 57:40.353
I don't think you
met my guy Adam.

57:40.355 --> 57:42.422
Nah, we ain't met.

57:42.424 --> 57:43.355
I seen your shit though.

57:43.357 --> 57:44.158
You a'ight, homie.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.591
Thanks, man!
I'm a huge fan of...

57:45.593 --> 57:46.659
A'ight.

57:46.661 --> 57:48.027
We got bitches,
blunts goin' around,

57:48.029 --> 57:50.496
hookers, pregnant prostitutes,

57:50.498 --> 57:52.065
white girl, molly.

57:52.067 --> 57:55.103
It's that West Coast
hospitality, baby.

58:06.549 --> 58:07.880
Your shit is crazy.

58:07.882 --> 58:09.716
That Virginia Tech line?

58:09.718 --> 58:11.350
You got bars, for real.

58:11.352 --> 58:12.453
Respect.

58:12.455 --> 58:14.721
It's just, that whole Asian
shit be getting to me.

58:14.723 --> 58:16.123
No matter what I say,
they can say

58:16.125 --> 58:18.859
some cliché-ass kung-fu lines
and it pops off.

58:18.861 --> 58:20.893
Okay, it's always
the same shit for me too.

58:20.895 --> 58:22.895
Whenever I battle a nigga,
I know everything

58:22.897 --> 58:24.165
he gon' say to me.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.399
I mean, that groom shit
was a little different,

58:25.401 --> 58:27.266
but at the end of the day,
it's the same shit.

58:27.268 --> 58:28.534
Just based on my gender.

58:28.536 --> 58:30.504
So how you
break out of that?

58:30.506 --> 58:31.737
You don't.

58:31.739 --> 58:33.841
No matter what,
I'm goin' get the bitch bars,

58:33.843 --> 58:35.109
and you goin' get
the Asian bars,

58:35.111 --> 58:38.444
and this kid'll always get
the white-ass nerd bars.

58:38.446 --> 58:40.916
Am I really a nerd, though?

58:41.283 --> 58:42.516
Never mind.

58:42.518 --> 58:44.216
Battling is an
expectations game.

58:44.218 --> 58:46.386
Niggas goin' always come
with the expected shit,

58:46.388 --> 58:48.254
'cause that's what
the audience wants to hear.

58:48.256 --> 58:50.991
But the fact that you can expect
it means you can flip it.

58:50.993 --> 58:52.359
Play it to your advantage.

58:52.361 --> 58:53.192
Yo, it is ON.

58:53.194 --> 58:54.527
I don't even know
this bitch's name,

58:54.529 --> 58:56.763
but she's a fuckin' smoke show
and she's ALL OVER me.

58:56.765 --> 58:57.931
I'm 'bout to smash for real.

58:57.933 --> 58:59.466
Don't you think
it's a problem that

58:59.468 --> 59:00.835
you don't know her name?

59:00.837 --> 59:02.368
Yo, the only problem is gonna
be when I'm fuckin' her

59:02.370 --> 59:05.004
so hard her teenage
daughter is gonna get

59:05.006 --> 59:06.507
pregnant in the future.

59:06.509 --> 59:08.375
Shit, how can THAT motherfucker

59:08.377 --> 59:09.576
get laid off battling?

59:09.578 --> 59:10.944
For me it just
makes it harder.

59:10.946 --> 59:13.279
I tell a nigga I battle
and his dick start tucking up

59:13.281 --> 59:16.150
like it's the
"Silence of the Lambs."

59:16.152 --> 59:17.384
I need a drink.

59:17.386 --> 59:19.252
Yo, I swear that's...

59:19.254 --> 59:21.788
nah, it can't be.

59:21.790 --> 59:23.022
You know her
from somewhere?

59:23.024 --> 59:25.558
Yeah... from jerking off.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.462
That's Bella Backwoods, yo,
I've been following her since

59:28.464 --> 59:30.163
Teen vids all
the way to MILF.

59:30.165 --> 59:30.763
That's...

59:30.765 --> 59:32.065
three years.

59:32.067 --> 59:34.466
That actually IS a long time
to follow a porn star.

59:34.468 --> 59:35.601
I'm sayin' though.

59:35.603 --> 59:38.306
Oh, my God, yes!

59:39.274 --> 59:40.507
Fuck.

59:40.509 --> 59:41.808
We gotta stop Che.

59:41.810 --> 59:43.710
Because of his deeply
problematic attitude towards

59:43.712 --> 59:45.145
hook-ups and
women in general?

59:45.147 --> 59:45.879
No.

59:45.881 --> 59:47.849
Because of THIS.

59:50.386 --> 59:51.384
We should.

59:51.386 --> 59:52.351
Get Behn.

59:54.823 --> 59:57.091
Oh, damn,
y'all perverts, man!

59:57.093 --> 59:59.259
Oh, you tryna get a picture
for the 'Gram, huh?

59:59.261 --> 01:00:00.897
Take that shit.

01:00:01.797 --> 01:00:03.496
Put your damn pants on.

01:00:03.498 --> 01:00:04.531
Alright, alright.
Shit, man.

01:00:04.533 --> 01:00:05.498
You tryna hit
this shit too?

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.567
At least let me
finish first.

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:08.400
Man, that's Megaton's girl,
you dumb-ass nigga.

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:10.237
You better hope and pray
he didn't see you come in here

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.737
or we all will be
getting fucked.

01:00:11.739 --> 01:00:12.839
Hurry up!

01:00:12.841 --> 01:00:13.774
Okay, okay!

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:14.808
Back up.

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.643
If anything,
this is between Bella

01:00:16.645 --> 01:00:18.846
and her boyfriend.

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.080
Are we seriously suggesting
that Che is somehow

01:00:21.082 --> 01:00:23.949
vaginally trespassing on
another man's property?

01:00:23.951 --> 01:00:26.319
So Bella has no sexual agency

01:00:26.321 --> 01:00:27.487
or bodily autonomy here?

01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:30.827
Ain't none of us gon' have
bodily autonomy if we dead!

01:00:39.067 --> 01:00:39.699
Fuck.

01:00:39.701 --> 01:00:40.937
Hey, babe.

01:00:47.475 --> 01:00:49.275
I'll deal with this
fucking whore later.

01:00:49.277 --> 01:00:50.576
Right now I'ma have
some words with

01:00:50.578 --> 01:00:51.844
my gardener real quick.

01:00:51.846 --> 01:00:52.978
Alright.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.647
Look, he didn't
mean to disrespect you.

01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:56.116
He's just a knucklehead.

01:00:56.118 --> 01:00:58.217
- If he would of knew...
- Get the fuck out

01:00:58.219 --> 01:00:58.951
my way, dog.

01:00:58.953 --> 01:00:59.886
This don't
even concern you.

01:00:59.888 --> 01:01:01.020
Well, I'm making
it my concern.

01:01:01.022 --> 01:01:03.022
Why, 'cause you
the big homie now?

01:01:03.024 --> 01:01:04.958
You fuckin' vouch for
him all of a sudden?

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.726
He didn't mean anything.

01:01:07.728 --> 01:01:09.096
We battle rappers.

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.897
We battle each other
and disrespect each other

01:01:11.899 --> 01:01:13.199
in the ring as rappers.

01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:16.768
But to come to my house,
and FUCK MY GIRL?

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:18.170
You disrespected me AS A MAN.

01:01:18.172 --> 01:01:21.408
So now we goin' have
to handle that as men.

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.946
If you wanna throw hands,
we can throw hands.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.813
But you gon'
keep them guns out.

01:01:27.815 --> 01:01:29.415
Oh we gon' do a lot
more than throw hands,

01:01:29.417 --> 01:01:31.219
motherfucker.

01:01:32.587 --> 01:01:34.122
I'ma see you...

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.226
in that ring.

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.728
It ain't gon' be no
straight rap shit though,

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.029
- you feel me?
- That's cool.

01:01:43.031 --> 01:01:44.230
Me and you got
a problem as men.

01:01:44.232 --> 01:01:46.799
We battle as men,
not just as rappers.

01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:47.868
- Straight up.
- That's cool.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.301
We could do that.

01:01:49.303 --> 01:01:51.203
Understood.

01:01:51.205 --> 01:01:52.371
Right?

01:01:52.373 --> 01:01:53.375
Yup.

01:01:57.846 --> 01:02:01.448
I'm sorry, a rap battle?

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.817
You wanna solve this
with a rap battle?

01:02:03.819 --> 01:02:05.250
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:05.252 --> 01:02:07.386
No, I'm over here
pissing my pants...

01:02:07.388 --> 01:02:08.989
That actually might
be literal...

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.991
thinking I'm surrounded
by straight-up gangsters

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.991
packing heat,
about to blow my brains

01:02:12.993 --> 01:02:14.726
all over this
lovely interior decor,

01:02:14.728 --> 01:02:16.996
but no.

01:02:16.998 --> 01:02:19.866
You think the most street
way to deal with this

01:02:19.868 --> 01:02:21.368
is with a rap battle!

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:24.304
That thing where a bunch of
grown-ass men get together

01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:26.038
in a room, call each
other gay and come up with

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.172
make-believe ways we're totally

01:02:27.174 --> 01:02:28.241
going to kill each other.

01:02:28.243 --> 01:02:30.377
Is that not
the corniest shit

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:31.877
you've ever heard in your life?

01:02:31.879 --> 01:02:33.147
Is that thing even real?

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.815
We was just leaving.

01:02:35.817 --> 01:02:36.984
Great to meet you all!

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.185
Come on up to
Berkeley sometime,

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:41.855
we settle beef with
word debates there too!

01:02:41.857 --> 01:02:43.390
Can you believe how
ridiculous that was?

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:46.359
To take this silly insult
game we play so seriously.

01:02:46.361 --> 01:02:47.794
I mean, love it,
but come on.

01:02:47.796 --> 01:02:49.995
I thought we were in a life or
death situation back there!

01:02:49.997 --> 01:02:50.998
Wooo!
Stop the car.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.232
Oh, yeah?
You want to grab a drink?

01:02:52.234 --> 01:02:53.900
Ooo, we should do a toast
to Che's big battle.

01:02:53.902 --> 01:02:54.967
Stop the fuckin' car!

01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:56.904
I'm having a fuckin'
panic attack!

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.306
Oh!

01:03:07.982 --> 01:03:09.082
I'm sorry, man.

01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:12.118
I have anxiety myself,
I know how it is.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.020
And that was an
insane situation.

01:03:14.022 --> 01:03:16.957
I just figured you
had a handle on it.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.058
Why?

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.993
'Cause I'm black,
so I'm supposed to be

01:03:19.995 --> 01:03:22.029
in the streets like that?

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.699
I'm a fuckin'
video game designer, dog.

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.000
You're WHAT?

01:03:27.002 --> 01:03:29.569
Oh, this is you
fucking with me.

01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:30.303
No.

01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:32.507
That's on my
daughter's life.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.875
You have a daughter?

01:03:35.877 --> 01:03:38.444
So, the slang, the accent.

01:03:38.446 --> 01:03:40.513
It's an act.

01:03:40.515 --> 01:03:41.515
This ain't no ACT.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.850
You never heard
a code-switchin', mah'fucka?

01:03:43.852 --> 01:03:44.784
Right.

01:03:44.786 --> 01:03:46.321
Of course.

01:03:48.122 --> 01:03:49.556
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make any assumptions.

01:03:49.558 --> 01:03:51.558
- I just thought...
- I know what you thought.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.926
You think I need
a white boy to tell me

01:03:52.928 --> 01:03:54.194
what he thought of me?

01:03:54.196 --> 01:03:57.931
Battle rap is not boxing,
it's a street fight.

01:03:57.933 --> 01:03:59.332
You wan't just
get your jaw broke,

01:03:59.334 --> 01:04:00.766
you got someone right
in your face

01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:02.167
trying to tear you apart.

01:04:02.169 --> 01:04:04.638
Your job, your girl, dick pics
you sent in high school.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.140
It's fair game.

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:09.308
That's why I keep my private
business actually private.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:13.013
And I never use personals
on my opponents, neither.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.551
I just talk
about shooting them.

01:04:20.055 --> 01:04:22.489
Okay.

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:24.123
What is that?

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:27.726
Look... front,
back, front, salute.

01:04:27.728 --> 01:04:29.098
Got it?

01:04:29.997 --> 01:04:31.063
Got it!

01:04:31.065 --> 01:04:32.464
A'ight. That was great.

01:04:32.466 --> 01:04:34.701
We got a long way to
Oakland to work on that.

01:04:34.703 --> 01:04:36.170
Shit!

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:38.074
What time is it?

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:52.819
Hey, um... do you think
since we're going back to

01:04:52.821 --> 01:04:56.422
your place anyway,
maybe I could...

01:04:56.424 --> 01:04:59.694
stay, at...?

01:05:02.663 --> 01:05:03.698
I got you.

01:05:08.335 --> 01:05:10.272
This place is awesome, man.

01:05:11.006 --> 01:05:12.839
I'm honestly surprised.

01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:13.973
You would be surprised.

01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:15.842
You a racist piece of shit.

01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:17.076
Yeah, I know.

01:05:17.078 --> 01:05:19.011
I'm trying hard not to be.

01:05:19.013 --> 01:05:21.313
I believe you
really think that.

01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:23.216
Look, before we
get up there,

01:05:23.218 --> 01:05:24.516
my wife got a problem with

01:05:24.518 --> 01:05:26.286
people calling me my rap name.

01:05:26.288 --> 01:05:29.658
So call me Osiris.
Or Oz.

01:05:30.825 --> 01:05:32.359
Your real name is Osiris?

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.460
Yeah.

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.627
But your rap name is BEHN?

01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:37.364
Yeah.

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:39.098
Okay.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.469
Man, I can HEAR the
racist shit you thinking.

01:05:43.471 --> 01:05:45.538
Everything is good,
you know.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.841
My wife make the best
burnt bacon ever.

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:48.708
Yeah?

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:52.248
- Yeah, man...
- Boy, take that hat off.

01:05:53.247 --> 01:05:55.448
Can I be done now?

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:58.486
Give me one more bite, baby.

01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:03.957
No, no, no, no, no,
give me one bigger than that!

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:04.891
There you go.

01:06:04.893 --> 01:06:06.560
Now you're done, okay?

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.062
Oz?

01:06:09.064 --> 01:06:11.498
I got it. I got it.
I got it.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.132
Hey, baby. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:13.134 --> 01:06:14.333
There you go. There you go.

01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:15.634
Just how we practiced, okay?

01:06:15.636 --> 01:06:17.439
Big deep breaths.

01:06:19.073 --> 01:06:20.373
Think of it like you're
breathing down

01:06:20.375 --> 01:06:24.914
into your tummy. In and out.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.350
In and out.

01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:31.452
There you go.

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.123
- Your feeling better?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:38.824
You wanna go
watch a little TV?

01:06:38.826 --> 01:06:40.428
Okay.

01:06:41.328 --> 01:06:43.897
Daddy will take you, c'mon.

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.431
What my baby
wanna watch, hmm?

01:06:45.433 --> 01:06:46.899
Austin and Ally!

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:49.335
I like that one too,
I'll watch it with you.

01:06:49.337 --> 01:06:51.471
Cystic fibrosis.

01:06:51.473 --> 01:06:53.339
She's had it since
she was born.

01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:56.141
Her lungs get clogged up
and it just makes it

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:58.346
hard for her to breathe.

01:06:59.247 --> 01:07:01.013
That's really tough.

01:07:01.015 --> 01:07:02.550
I'm sorry.

01:07:04.152 --> 01:07:06.618
So, Adam, what do you do?

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.620
I mean besides appropriate
black culture

01:07:08.622 --> 01:07:10.757
for your livelihood.

01:07:10.759 --> 01:07:11.994
That's hilarious.

01:07:13.027 --> 01:07:14.226
Oh. Okay.

01:07:14.228 --> 01:07:15.395
I'm a student.

01:07:15.397 --> 01:07:16.728
English Lit major.

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:18.665
I'm actually more
interested in what Behn...

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.667
Oz does, to be
honest with you.

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:21.835
Video game design.

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:24.002
How did you get into that?

01:07:24.004 --> 01:07:27.839
I stabbed a video game
designer and took his laptop.

01:07:27.841 --> 01:07:29.208
Really?

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.877
What's wrong with you?

01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:32.714
I went to college.

01:07:33.982 --> 01:07:36.116
And do they, uh... know?

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.984
About the battle rap?

01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:38.917
Yeah.

01:07:38.919 --> 01:07:39.685
And they're cool with it?

01:07:39.687 --> 01:07:41.054
With a black guy
being a rapper?

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.489
You know what,
I'ma be honest,

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.223
it does get annoying sometime
when you're working

01:07:44.225 --> 01:07:46.391
on an FPS and you got all
these dudes coming up

01:07:46.393 --> 01:07:48.127
to you asking you
details about a gun.

01:07:48.129 --> 01:07:49.362
Well, it's great that
your wife is

01:07:49.364 --> 01:07:50.362
so supportive of you battling.

01:07:50.364 --> 01:07:51.330
Why wouldn't I?

01:07:51.332 --> 01:07:52.431
It's just my
girlfriend isn't.

01:07:52.433 --> 01:07:53.900
'Cause of all the
woman-bashing and stuff.

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:55.835
I just thought you may
be against it because

01:07:55.837 --> 01:07:58.606
it portrays a certain
...negative image.

01:08:01.576 --> 01:08:04.710
I see we got no "respectability
politics"-ass motherfucker

01:08:04.712 --> 01:08:05.944
at the table.

01:08:05.946 --> 01:08:07.145
No, no, I got it.

01:08:07.147 --> 01:08:08.348
A'ight.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.716
You really want to sit
here and spout off about

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:12.685
"negative image," when we
both know that no matter

01:08:12.687 --> 01:08:16.388
how much money he makes,
no matter how "well" he speaks,

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:17.923
no matter how many
suits he puts on,

01:08:17.925 --> 01:08:19.993
he can still go out and get
shot in the street

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.426
by the police for no reason.

01:08:21.429 --> 01:08:22.560
That I can have
the same fate?

01:08:22.563 --> 01:08:23.694
That my daughter can?

01:08:23.697 --> 01:08:26.598
So if he's gonna
make money by battling,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.567
and put food on
this here table,

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.136
with the talents that
God has given him,

01:08:30.138 --> 01:08:31.537
oh, you damn right
I'ma support him.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.971
No matter how many of y'all
little white boys come up in

01:08:32.974 --> 01:08:37.009
here talking about how
"negative" it might be.

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.078
But you live in Rockridge,
the safest neighborhood

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.446
- in Oak...
- Damn it.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:42.448
I can't believe I just had
to black-splain some shit to

01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:44.216
you in my own damn house.

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:45.685
Maybe that's all
white people need,

01:08:45.687 --> 01:08:47.853
is just to have someone
explain stuff to us.

01:08:47.854 --> 01:08:50.189
So it's not enough that
this country was literally

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:53.359
built off of our oppression,
but now that we get an iota

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.127
of freedom, we gotta
go explaining that

01:08:55.129 --> 01:08:57.495
same oppression back to y'all?

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:59.298
No. Not tonight, Satan.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.334
I need to go
make me some tea.

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:04.904
And Oz... I love you,
but if you think

01:09:04.906 --> 01:09:07.673
that MC Micro-Agression here
is spending one night under

01:09:07.675 --> 01:09:10.243
this here roof, both of
y'all can go find yourselves

01:09:10.245 --> 01:09:11.542
a hotel room where
you can discuss

01:09:11.545 --> 01:09:14.082
"black-on-black crime" together.

01:09:17.184 --> 01:09:19.554
She BODIED you, nigga.

01:09:22.389 --> 01:09:24.557
I felt bad when
it was a black guy,

01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:26.625
but look at all
his privilege.

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:28.694
White kids choosing to be
homeless so they can act

01:09:28.696 --> 01:09:32.468
like Kerouac are the reason
we don't have communism.

01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:38.837
Actually, the reason we
don't have communism is your

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.606
undermining of the
interracial solidarity and

01:09:40.608 --> 01:09:42.475
class consciousness
of the proletariat.

01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:44.410
And you look like you'd
smoke pumpkin spice

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:46.915
out a junkie's pipe!

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:53.953
<i>Adam.</i>

01:09:53.955 --> 01:09:55.521
Hey, babe.

01:09:55.523 --> 01:09:57.123
I was hoping we could talk,
now that we've had

01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:58.324
a chance to cool off.

01:09:58.326 --> 01:09:59.726
<i>Hmm. It's funny.</i>

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.598
<i>This is exactly what your
father said you would do.</i>

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:04.931
You talked to my dad?

01:10:04.933 --> 01:10:07.133
About our relationship?

01:10:07.135 --> 01:10:10.003
<i>Well, he had some prescient
insights, actually.</i>

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.871
<i>He pointed out the parallels
with Dmitry and Katya</i>

01:10:11.873 --> 01:10:13.571
- <i>in The Brothers Kara...</i>
- This conversation is really,

01:10:13.573 --> 01:10:14.539
really important to me.

01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:15.473
Can you hold on a second?

01:10:15.475 --> 01:10:17.710
I have to take this call.

01:10:17.712 --> 01:10:18.710
Yo.

01:10:18.712 --> 01:10:20.312
<i>Yo, Adam, what's goody.</i>

01:10:20.314 --> 01:10:21.347
Hunnid Gramz!

01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:22.915
This is awesome.

01:10:22.917 --> 01:10:24.183
It's an honor.

01:10:24.185 --> 01:10:25.151
<i>A'ight, word.</i>

01:10:25.153 --> 01:10:26.552
<i>Check it out, right.</i>

01:10:26.554 --> 01:10:28.053
<i>We got an event end of the
month where we settin' up</i>

01:10:28.055 --> 01:10:31.624
<i>Megaton verse Che to deal with
all this beef out here, okay.</i>

01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:34.360
<i>And I thought it'd be EXTRA
dope to have a co-headliner:</i>

01:10:34.362 --> 01:10:38.364
<i>Adam verse Behn Grym.</i>

01:10:38.366 --> 01:10:40.102
Can you hold on a sec?

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:43.035
I have a huge opportunity.

01:10:43.037 --> 01:10:44.169
Huge for US.

01:10:44.171 --> 01:10:46.571
<i>Is it your window of
opportunity for begging</i>

01:10:46.573 --> 01:10:47.807
<i>for my forgiveness?</i>

01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:50.176
- You don't understand...<i>
- I DON'T understand.</i>

01:10:50.178 --> 01:10:52.311
<i>I don't even know who
the hell you are right now.</i>

01:10:52.313 --> 01:10:53.245
<i>Do YOU?</i>

01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:55.149
One sec.

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.249
Gramz?

01:10:57.251 --> 01:10:58.551
<i>Dude, you playing
hardball, huh?</i>

01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:00.052
<i>Tell you what,
you take the match,</i>

01:11:00.054 --> 01:11:02.321
<i>I got five racks for y'all.
Each.</i>

01:11:02.323 --> 01:11:06.558
- It's not about the money...<i>
- This could be the biggest</i>

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.994
<i>match of your career.</i>

01:11:07.996 --> 01:11:10.495
<i>People always wanna see the
master face his protégé, okay.</i>

01:11:10.497 --> 01:11:13.432
<i>If you go off,
you a legend for life.</i>

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.137
Okay. I'll take the battle.

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:19.438
<i>WHAT battle?</i>

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.740
Maya!

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:23.476
The lifelong battle of
winning back your trust?

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:24.643
<i>I'm hanging up now.</i>

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:25.645
No, NO, NO, DON'T.

01:11:25.647 --> 01:11:27.813
I'll get rid of
the other call.

01:11:27.815 --> 01:11:29.548
Okay, it's just you
and me now,

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:30.482
I promise.

01:11:30.484 --> 01:11:31.417
<i>WOAH.</i>

01:11:31.419 --> 01:11:33.151
<i>I'm just offerin' a match-up.</i>

01:11:33.153 --> 01:11:34.387
Wait, who is this?

01:11:34.389 --> 01:11:36.957
<i>Hunnid fuckin' Gramz,
town bizness.</i>

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.558
<i>Look, there ain't no
"you and me" all of a sudden.</i>

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.694
<i>I mean, you got some shit,
but I ain't tryna make</i>

01:11:41.696 --> 01:11:43.864
<i>a funny white boy my
flagship artist or nothing.</i>

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.899
<i>No offense.</i>

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.467
Yo. I mean, hey.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.302
I mean, who...?

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.370
<i>So the other call
is gone?</i>

01:11:51.372 --> 01:11:53.075
Right.

01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:56.875
Okay, babe, it's done.

01:11:56.877 --> 01:11:58.043
<i>What the FUCK
you call me?</i>

01:11:58.045 --> 01:12:00.545
<i>Uh, YOU "the fuck"
called ME.</i>

01:12:00.547 --> 01:12:02.214
<i>What you doin'
with your voice now?</i>

01:12:02.216 --> 01:12:05.218
<i>Offer a white boy some money
and y'all get weird as shit.</i>

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.719
I think I... accidentally
merged the two calls.

01:12:07.721 --> 01:12:09.754
<i>Adam???
Who is this?</i>

01:12:09.756 --> 01:12:12.225
<i>Ohhh, so you
really IS a bitch.</i>

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.793
<i>Yo, your voice sound sexy.</i>

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:15.328
<i>I like a woman who sounds like
she 'bout to make</i>

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.762
<i>my ass pay alimony.</i>

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:18.063
- Oh, my God.
- <i>PIG.</i>

01:12:18.065 --> 01:12:19.832
<i>And I am not saying
that because you're black.</i>

01:12:19.834 --> 01:12:21.100
<i>And I'm not even assuming
that you are black.</i>

01:12:21.102 --> 01:12:23.302
<i>Damn it, Adam,
why do you always make me</i>

01:12:23.304 --> 01:12:24.536
<i>sound so RACIST?</i>

01:12:24.538 --> 01:12:26.740
<i>That's a keeper,
bruh, f'real f'real.</i>

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.508
<i>So what's good
with the battle?</i>

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:32.043
I'm not doing
any more battles.

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:33.945
Ever again.

01:12:33.947 --> 01:12:35.013
I'm out.

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:37.883
I just lost my
girlfriend for good,

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:40.753
I got beat up by a vegan,
and I'm sleeping on

01:12:40.755 --> 01:12:43.623
a fucking park bench,
all because of battle rap.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:46.793
And you guys don't
even take me seriously.

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:49.094
Plus, everywhere
I go people think

01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:50.996
I'm some neo-Nazi racist.

01:12:50.998 --> 01:12:53.066
It's like I'm walking
around yelling "chink,

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:56.672
kike, gook, spic, faggot,
raghead"...

01:12:58.872 --> 01:13:01.874
I've been getting reports
of a homeless man

01:13:01.876 --> 01:13:07.313
on this bench verbally
accosting passersby.

01:13:07.315 --> 01:13:10.348
What can you
tell me about this?

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:12.418
I haven't seen anyone.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.723
I should get to class.

01:13:33.273 --> 01:13:34.007
Maya.

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:35.208
Can I talk to
you for a sec?

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.310
You left her stranded
in a Los Angeles ghetto.

01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:38.444
She has nothing
to say to you.

01:13:38.446 --> 01:13:39.579
She left me stranded!...

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:40.780
That's not important right now.

01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:41.780
Look, Maya, I just
want you to know that

01:13:41.782 --> 01:13:43.249
I'm quitting rap battling.

01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:44.049
For real.

01:13:44.051 --> 01:13:45.218
It made me into a
complete asshole.

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.252
I totally get it.

01:13:46.254 --> 01:13:47.085
Alright, everyone.

01:13:47.087 --> 01:13:49.088
As you know, we have
subject thesis

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:50.289
presentations today.

01:13:50.291 --> 01:13:54.026
A brave soul among you
has volunteered to go first...

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:55.227
Maya.

01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:57.963
Oh, please, don't give
me the sad puppy dog act.

01:13:57.965 --> 01:13:59.999
I know you think you're
the hero of the story,

01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:02.601
and that I'm just the cliché
controlling bitch girlfriend

01:14:02.603 --> 01:14:04.235
who the audience is
supposed to hate.

01:14:04.237 --> 01:14:07.173
But have you ever stopped
to think I might be a bitch

01:14:07.175 --> 01:14:08.240
with a POINT?

01:14:08.242 --> 01:14:09.843
That the real problem here
isn't the TONE of what

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:12.214
I'm saying, it's the CONTENT
of what you've said?

01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:16.382
Your life fails
the Bechdel test.

01:14:16.384 --> 01:14:18.517
- Yasss, bitch.
- Mmm, get it.

01:14:18.519 --> 01:14:20.119
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:20.121 --> 01:14:22.454
Thanks, Mr. Kendall.

01:14:22.456 --> 01:14:24.490
So the subject of my thesis is

01:14:24.492 --> 01:14:26.325
"The Cultural Legitimization of

01:14:26.327 --> 01:14:29.895
White Racism in America as
'Free Expression.'"

01:14:29.897 --> 01:14:32.030
I plan to trace this idea
from its emergence in

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:34.734
the mid-20th Century,
when racism became

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:36.968
less forthright and more
coded, through today,

01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:38.137
when it has become
particularly salient...

01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:39.938
<i>Look, I understand
where you coming from.</i>

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.008
<i>I wanna quit this
shit half the time too.</i>

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.776
<i>And you think I really
wanna battle a homie?</i>

01:14:44.778 --> 01:14:46.244
<i>It's five Gs on the line.</i>

01:14:46.246 --> 01:14:48.448
<i>And I know my family could
really use that money.</i>

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.016
<i>We got a few
unexpected bills,</i>

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.584
<i>for Grace.</i>

01:14:51.586 --> 01:14:53.017
<i>I'm not gonna
bore you with that.</i>

01:14:53.019 --> 01:14:54.686
<i>I'm just asking
you, as a friend.</i>

01:14:54.688 --> 01:14:56.088
<i>Would you please
take the battle?</i>

01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:57.323
<i>Why are you even
talking to that</i>

01:14:57.325 --> 01:14:59.924
<i>"I don't see color" -type
racist ass bum?</i>

01:14:59.926 --> 01:15:02.928
<i>I told you, Young White
Privilege ain't trying to</i>

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:04.629
<i>help nobody but
his damn self.</i>

01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:06.198
<i>Old dumb motherfucker.</i>

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.700
One interesting example
in the 21st Century context

01:15:07.702 --> 01:15:08.968
is battle rap.

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.869
Now what started as an
authentic African-American

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:12.705
experience has
been co-opted,

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:15.240
like so many other things,
by white supremacists,

01:15:15.242 --> 01:15:19.078
as a space to say
obscenely racist things

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.716
under the guise of
"competition."

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:26.451
Trigger warning: in
addition to its vile racism,

01:15:26.453 --> 01:15:28.588
this video contains transphobia,

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:29.888
slut shaming,

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.326
and an enormous douchebag.

01:15:33.728 --> 01:15:35.526
<i>Even Asian bitches
won't fuck you,</i>

01:15:35.528 --> 01:15:37.295
<i>that means you're hella frail /</i>

01:15:37.297 --> 01:15:39.499
<i>Ordering tuna at
sushi is the only time</i>

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.767
<i>you get yellow tail /...</i>

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.401
<i>You just take a little
cut from the trees /...</i>

01:15:42.403 --> 01:15:44.337
<i>'Cause you really don't know
what you're fucking with</i>

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:48.743
<i>like you had a one-night
stand... in Thailand.</i>

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.313
<i>FAGGOT!!!</i>

01:15:58.051 --> 01:15:59.886
The f-slur, Adam?
Really?

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.120
That's not only offensive,
it's offensively basic.

01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:04.656
You can bet your guilao ass
that EVERY Asian on campus

01:16:04.658 --> 01:16:05.725
is going to know about this.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:06.959
Well, I thought
it was hilarious.

01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:08.761
I don't even mind that
you used that word...

01:16:08.763 --> 01:16:11.364
you've always been
a faggot to me.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.300
Thank you.

01:16:22.977 --> 01:16:24.810
Oh, I can come back,
if you're busy.

01:16:24.812 --> 01:16:25.844
No, come on in.

01:16:25.846 --> 01:16:27.815
Have a seat.

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.784
What are you doing here?

01:16:31.786 --> 01:16:34.085
I'm kind of... homeless.

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:36.789
I was wondering if
I could stay with you.

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:38.360
For a few days.

01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:41.561
No.

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:43.027
Why do you smell
like cocoa butter?

01:16:43.029 --> 01:16:45.230
Well, I spent the last
week sleeping on a bench.

01:16:45.232 --> 01:16:47.467
The last homeless guy
left a bottle there.

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:48.734
My skin was all dry.

01:16:48.736 --> 01:16:50.305
You know what I mean.

01:16:51.505 --> 01:16:54.539
I don't mean you,
I just mean,

01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:56.441
because you're a nurse.

01:16:56.443 --> 01:16:58.546
I'm the Dean of this school.

01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:03.248
So after Maya showed that
video of your "battle"

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.982
in class yesterday,
that went viral.

01:17:04.984 --> 01:17:06.886
The administration is now

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:08.587
under a lot of pressure to act.

01:17:08.589 --> 01:17:11.323
You know how sensitive
the climate is towards racism

01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:14.727
and appropriation...
and your performance was

01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:16.896
downright Iggy Azalean.

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.498
Why does the school
care about what I do

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.365
in my private life?

01:17:19.367 --> 01:17:21.933
It's 2018, there is
no private life.

01:17:21.935 --> 01:17:24.904
The university cannot
afford a scandal right now.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:27.406
The Asian American Association
is ready to turn this

01:17:27.408 --> 01:17:28.941
into Bien Dien Phu,

01:17:28.943 --> 01:17:31.243
and the Jewish Law
Students' Association

01:17:31.245 --> 01:17:34.012
is already filing a harassment
lawsuit against the campus.

01:17:34.014 --> 01:17:35.949
I didn't say anything
about Jewish people.

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.049
Well, that may well be,
but many members of the JSLA are

01:17:38.051 --> 01:17:40.585
dating members of the
Asian American Association.

01:17:40.587 --> 01:17:44.390
So what do you have against
interracial relationships?

01:17:44.392 --> 01:17:45.390
Huh?

01:17:45.392 --> 01:17:48.927
And there's the added
visibility factor of

01:17:48.929 --> 01:17:50.396
me being your father.

01:17:50.398 --> 01:17:52.966
Like it or not,
people notice when Kylo Ren

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.567
has a Force tantrum because
he's Han Solo's son.

01:17:55.569 --> 01:17:56.768
Sorry, Dean... spoilers.

01:17:56.770 --> 01:17:59.471
I know this looks bad, but it's
all for my thesis subject,

01:17:59.473 --> 01:18:01.539
which is on the use
of the word "nigga"...

01:18:01.541 --> 01:18:03.174
EXCUSE ME???

01:18:03.176 --> 01:18:06.611
Sorry, Behn Grym told me that
it's more respectful to say

01:18:06.613 --> 01:18:08.013
"nigga."

01:18:08.015 --> 01:18:12.151
The rock monster from
the Fantastic Four

01:18:12.153 --> 01:18:15.353
said you could us
the N-word?...

01:18:15.355 --> 01:18:16.323
He's black.

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:19.691
I gotta go to class.

01:18:19.693 --> 01:18:21.026
Actually, you don't.

01:18:21.028 --> 01:18:22.061
Effectively immediately

01:18:22.063 --> 01:18:23.361
- your scholarship is being...
- What?

01:18:23.363 --> 01:18:25.431
Thirty years in academia,
and every man still thinks

01:18:25.433 --> 01:18:28.366
his balls have the
right to interrupt me.

01:18:28.368 --> 01:18:31.637
I said that effective
immediately your scholarship

01:18:31.639 --> 01:18:32.737
is being suspended.

01:18:32.739 --> 01:18:34.071
Don't look at me.

01:18:34.073 --> 01:18:35.607
I gotta think about
my own situation here.

01:18:35.609 --> 01:18:38.444
If I'm seen publicly
supporting your comments,

01:18:38.446 --> 01:18:39.477
I'll be like the next

01:18:39.479 --> 01:18:41.547
"insert whatever the
Internet is mad at today."

01:18:41.549 --> 01:18:42.615
So you're disowning me?

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.816
Adam, use a less plutocratic
word than disowning.

01:18:44.818 --> 01:18:45.884
I'm not a racist.

01:18:45.886 --> 01:18:47.018
How can you judge
someone based off

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.454
one clip on YouTube?

01:18:48.456 --> 01:18:50.755
Because I wrote the book.

01:18:50.757 --> 01:18:52.594
Several.

01:18:55.895 --> 01:18:57.663
"People pay for what they do,

01:18:57.665 --> 01:19:01.670
and still more for what they
allow themselves to become."

01:19:02.403 --> 01:19:04.035
James Baldwin.

01:19:04.037 --> 01:19:05.304
And to quote a
more contemporary

01:19:05.306 --> 01:19:07.039
African-American writer,
that was the realest shit

01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:09.074
he ever wrote.

01:19:09.076 --> 01:19:11.944
Well... if Karamazov
DID commit patricide,

01:19:11.946 --> 01:19:14.646
then I wouldn't be
that surprised.

01:19:14.648 --> 01:19:16.815
That's precisely the
rhetoric I can't abide.

01:19:16.817 --> 01:19:19.785
Well, I am being bastardized.

01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:22.320
Are you trying to satirize?

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:25.191
If did, then would
you be satisfied?

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:28.660
Stop rhyming,
you little shit!

01:19:28.662 --> 01:19:31.333
This family is fucked up.

01:19:50.084 --> 01:19:51.917
Safe space, not hate space!

01:19:51.919 --> 01:19:53.852
Asian Americans against Adam!

01:19:53.854 --> 01:19:57.722
We will not excuse
horrific racist slander

01:19:57.724 --> 01:19:59.491
just because it rhymes!

01:19:59.493 --> 01:20:03.928
Intolerance will
not be tolerated!

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:05.063
THERE HE IS!

01:20:05.065 --> 01:20:06.832
Remember, this is
a peaceful protest...

01:20:06.834 --> 01:20:07.966
resist the understandable urge

01:20:07.968 --> 01:20:09.869
to tear his limbs from his body.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.204
Go jerk off to anime!

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.236
Delete your account.

01:20:12.238 --> 01:20:13.704
You've got everybody out here

01:20:13.706 --> 01:20:16.008
getting our culture fucked up.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:16.976
Again.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:17.910
Thanks for that.

01:20:17.912 --> 01:20:19.878
Get woke, cocksucker.

01:20:21.748 --> 01:20:23.582
Behn?...

01:20:23.584 --> 01:20:24.783
I'm in.

01:20:24.785 --> 01:20:26.451
Let's do it.

01:20:26.453 --> 01:20:28.590
Oakland... IS
Y'ALL IN HERE???

01:20:31.024 --> 01:20:33.091
The main events we got
comin' up are gonna be

01:20:33.093 --> 01:20:35.026
institutionalized
for their insanity,

01:20:35.028 --> 01:20:37.429
but don't sleep on the two
dope-ass spitters

01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:40.298
that we got right here,
right now.

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.235
Now, I know you heard all
the jokes about Asian men

01:20:43.237 --> 01:20:45.370
never gettin' together
with black women...

01:20:45.372 --> 01:20:47.306
but fuck did, we did it, y'all.

01:20:47.308 --> 01:20:49.641
KBL breakin' down
all types a barriers,

01:20:49.643 --> 01:20:51.576
ya dig?

01:20:51.578 --> 01:20:53.081
You ready for this?

01:20:53.781 --> 01:20:55.246
I hope so.

01:20:55.248 --> 01:20:57.482
This is a special
ONE-round matchup.

01:20:57.484 --> 01:20:59.552
Both rappers
requested this,

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:01.954
so you know it's gonna
be some coldass shit.

01:21:01.956 --> 01:21:04.121
Rapper on my
right, state your name.

01:21:04.123 --> 01:21:05.892
Devine Wright,
'cause I'm the motherfuckin'

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:08.360
queen of this shit!

01:21:08.362 --> 01:21:11.295
Nervous rapper on the left,
state your name, soldier.

01:21:11.297 --> 01:21:13.699
Prospek, representing
K-Town, Los Angeles.

01:21:13.701 --> 01:21:16.035
Stand the fuck up.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.302
You looking like you
drank from the wrong

01:21:17.304 --> 01:21:19.338
Grail or some shit.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:20.472
You good?

01:21:20.474 --> 01:21:21.740
I'm good.

01:21:21.742 --> 01:21:23.709
Respect for taking the match.

01:21:23.711 --> 01:21:26.344
Check should definitely help.

01:21:26.346 --> 01:21:28.246
Grace, she's doing good.

01:21:28.248 --> 01:21:29.582
This should be
good for you, man,

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:30.449
I hope you kill it.

01:21:30.451 --> 01:21:31.816
I can't wait to
see what you've got.

01:21:31.818 --> 01:21:32.985
Right.

01:21:32.987 --> 01:21:34.419
I got some shit.

01:21:34.421 --> 01:21:37.088
Either way we goin' be boys.

01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:39.857
After all, you don't
do personals, right?

01:21:39.859 --> 01:21:41.595
Right.

01:21:45.099 --> 01:21:46.868
I'll let you do your thing.

01:21:51.304 --> 01:21:53.504
Now Devine chose to go first,

01:21:53.506 --> 01:21:56.411
so it's all on you,
Queen, let's get it.

01:21:59.479 --> 01:22:01.379
Fuck this Asian
motherfucker!!!

01:22:01.381 --> 01:22:05.183
Fuck this kamikaze
plane, Tamagotchi playin',

01:22:05.185 --> 01:22:07.085
shots of saki takin'
motherfucker

01:22:07.087 --> 01:22:08.456
What the fuck?

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:10.321
Ooh, I get it.

01:22:10.323 --> 01:22:13.292
Fuck Lucy Liu and Sulu too /

01:22:13.294 --> 01:22:15.293
Fuck your ninja stars,
your Subaru,

01:22:15.295 --> 01:22:19.365
fuck Buddha and Confucius too /

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.533
Wait, actually I don't know if
I should be rhyming all that,

01:22:21.535 --> 01:22:23.401
I don't know how
China attacks /

01:22:23.403 --> 01:22:24.802
I'm not trying to
get a cyber-attack or

01:22:24.804 --> 01:22:26.972
- trying to get hacked
- He's disrespectful!

01:22:26.974 --> 01:22:29.341
If you were on your death bed
and saw your life in a flash /

01:22:29.343 --> 01:22:30.674
It would be
you designing an app,

01:22:30.676 --> 01:22:34.079
dining on cats, and
doing science and math

01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:35.181
What the fuck is he doing?

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:37.348
This fool is killing
HIMSELF right now!

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:40.619
Samurais take this hari-kari
shit seriously, bruh!

01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:42.088
Your family's either
making Civics

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.989
or has a nail and
facial business /

01:22:43.991 --> 01:22:45.289
I'm surprised the movie Crash

01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:46.892
didn't have more
Asians in it

01:22:46.894 --> 01:22:48.494
That's foul.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:49.360
That's foul.

01:22:49.362 --> 01:22:50.663
Why is it so hard
for you to drive?/

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.263
I seen Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon,

01:22:52.265 --> 01:22:54.833
you motherfuckers
used to fly /

01:22:54.835 --> 01:22:57.936
You know what you call goin'
with an Asian on a Uber ride?...

01:22:57.938 --> 01:22:58.904
What's that?

01:22:58.906 --> 01:23:00.873
Suicide!

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.709
If I cut your voice box
I bet you'd bleed soy sauce /

01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:06.210
When you're at the arcade
they mistakin'

01:23:06.212 --> 01:23:08.347
your eyes for the coin slots /

01:23:08.349 --> 01:23:10.048
This Asian is an
overachiever,

01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:13.285
you be catchin' more dogs than
you can store in the freezer /

01:23:13.287 --> 01:23:16.154
Your idea of playing catch
is throwing a cleaver

01:23:16.156 --> 01:23:18.760
at a golden retriever /

01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:21.761
So if I call you a rice farming,

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.329
bootlegging, dry cleaning,

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.964
bad driving piece of shit
and these dudes'll laugh /

01:23:25.966 --> 01:23:27.900
And if you're wondering
why I'm dissing Asians...

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:29.904
you do the math

01:23:32.572 --> 01:23:34.640
I don't know what
the fuck just happened,

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:37.476
but I love what
the fuck just happened.

01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:40.279
Devine, I know you not
gonna let him talk to him,

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:41.946
I mean talk to you
like that, right?

01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:42.815
Hell no.

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.652
A'ight, let's get it then.

01:23:45.519 --> 01:23:49.454
This bitch got at me
for being Asian,

01:23:49.456 --> 01:23:52.624
mmm... but came
with some weak shit/

01:23:52.626 --> 01:23:56.227
So now I gotta get
on my shit dissing ladies...

01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:59.832
'cause that's clearly
what she is!

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:04.203
Ain't no vaginoplast'

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.870
that can give her
a tighter snatch /

01:24:05.872 --> 01:24:08.406
This bitch got a wider
gap than the income

01:24:08.408 --> 01:24:11.075
between white and black.

01:24:11.077 --> 01:24:12.209
That's a wide gap!

01:24:12.211 --> 01:24:13.244
That's a wide gap!

01:24:13.246 --> 01:24:14.879
If she ain't giving up
the pussy,

01:24:14.881 --> 01:24:17.615
you could get sucked then,
that's a black ho /

01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:20.785
I said even if she ain't
giving up the pussy,

01:24:20.787 --> 01:24:25.290
you could get sucked in,
that's a black hole! /

01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:27.424
Before I even let
the gun kiss her

01:24:27.426 --> 01:24:29.761
I'ma give this bitch a Tic Tac /

01:24:29.763 --> 01:24:31.196
Whoo!

01:24:31.198 --> 01:24:33.701
'Cause I'm brushin' so loud What
she's spitting got a kickback! /

01:24:35.736 --> 01:24:39.271
They be havin' stage fright
when I whip out this dick /

01:24:39.273 --> 01:24:40.504
'Cause it'll make
a bitch choke

01:24:40.506 --> 01:24:43.575
and then forget how to spit /

01:24:43.577 --> 01:24:45.444
She too ugly to even
feed her the D,

01:24:45.446 --> 01:24:47.346
the only way a nigga
keep her in Gs /

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:49.147
If she Ayesha Curry
and her cookin' make

01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:51.551
niggas weak in the knees /

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.221
She be having welfare babies,

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:56.722
but I give
the hustle respect /...

01:24:56.724 --> 01:25:00.892
'Cause we both sonnin'
niggas just for the check!!! /

01:25:00.894 --> 01:25:03.561
I know y'all confused
by what we doin',

01:25:03.563 --> 01:25:05.163
so check it...
we just figured /

01:25:05.165 --> 01:25:06.699
We'd flip the same shit

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:09.234
we always hear
from you fuck niggas! /

01:25:09.236 --> 01:25:11.102
So yo Pro,
we killed this shit,

01:25:11.104 --> 01:25:14.371
we fuckin' em up, nigga /
And for the rest of y'all,

01:25:14.373 --> 01:25:16.275
you can do them cliché bars...

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:19.881
but you can't do them
better than US, nigga!

01:25:22.315 --> 01:25:24.749
Devine won that clearly,
no debating.

01:25:24.751 --> 01:25:27.185
Yeah, but she was goin'
at herself basically.

01:25:27.187 --> 01:25:28.654
So...

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.655
Prospek won?

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:31.856
Nah, Prospek lost,
but he was dissin' Asians,

01:25:31.858 --> 01:25:33.058
which means he...

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.860
beat himself?

01:25:34.862 --> 01:25:36.861
We need algebra
for this shit, bruh.

01:25:36.863 --> 01:25:39.063
That's some shit that could
only happen in Oakland,

01:25:39.065 --> 01:25:40.298
you feel me?

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.200
Make some noise for those
fools bodying everbody

01:25:42.202 --> 01:25:44.402
within a five-mile
radius with that shit!

01:25:44.404 --> 01:25:45.838
That worked out perfect.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.571
Hell yeah!

01:25:46.573 --> 01:25:48.073
Your female bars
were craaaazy.

01:25:48.075 --> 01:25:49.274
Yo, your Asian bars, too.

01:25:49.276 --> 01:25:51.243
They gon' make China
a no-fly zone for you.

01:25:51.245 --> 01:25:52.511
That shit was wild, bro.

01:25:52.513 --> 01:25:54.146
Y'all took me on a
roller coaster of emotions.

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:56.914
I don't know how many people
here GOT what y'all did.

01:25:56.916 --> 01:25:57.615
Pure genius.

01:25:57.617 --> 01:26:00.317
Your sensei would be proud, bro.

01:26:00.319 --> 01:26:01.919
Oh, he died.

01:26:01.921 --> 01:26:02.954
Wait... for real?

01:26:02.956 --> 01:26:04.457
Yeah. He got in another fight
at the restaurant

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:05.790
and one dude pulled
a knife out.

01:26:05.792 --> 01:26:07.258
Roundhoused like four dudes
before he dropped though.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.194
Went out like a G.

01:26:09.196 --> 01:26:10.228
Respect.

01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:11.429
Dope battle, anyway.

01:26:11.431 --> 01:26:12.998
We gonna need a minute
to recover from that.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.134
But comin' up next though,
we got my man

01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:20.172
Behn Grym versus Adam.
Okay.

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.272
Where the hell is Adam at?

01:26:21.274 --> 01:26:23.075
Adam, come to the ring.

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:24.342
Where is Adam?

01:26:24.344 --> 01:26:26.544
Why is the white
boy on CP time?

01:26:26.546 --> 01:26:28.112
<i>You thought since
I'm a white boy</i>

01:26:28.114 --> 01:26:29.380
<i>that he would scare me pale? /</i>

01:26:29.382 --> 01:26:31.083
<i>You can't rep
the brothers Grym,</i>

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:32.450
<i>your life is a fairy tale</i>

01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:33.918
<i>Get hit with
a combo breaker,</i>

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:34.485
<i>the Boston strangler,</i>

01:26:34.487 --> 01:26:35.620
<i>from the Casa de Vega,</i>

01:26:35.622 --> 01:26:37.489
<i>you soccer player
slash commentator,</i>

01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:38.723
<i>La Bamba singer,</i>

01:26:38.725 --> 01:26:40.625
<i>shout out to all the
Spanish Armada raiders,</i>

01:26:40.627 --> 01:26:41.825
<i>that came through
your fuckin' crib</i>

01:26:41.827 --> 01:26:44.131
<i>and took your mom
and raped her.</i>

01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:52.038
Good luck.

01:26:56.143 --> 01:26:58.677
This is it... the first
main event of the night.

01:26:58.679 --> 01:27:00.913
Master versus protégé.

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:03.048
Sensei versus student.

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:04.717
Jedi versus Padawan.

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:06.819
The rapper on my right
needs no introduction.

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:09.387
He's a Bay Area LEGEND,
so put some respeck

01:27:09.389 --> 01:27:11.459
on his name.

01:27:11.959 --> 01:27:13.057
Behn Grym.

01:27:13.059 --> 01:27:15.192
Rapper on my left,
he may need an intro or two...

01:27:15.194 --> 01:27:17.195
Let's just fucking do this.

01:27:17.197 --> 01:27:18.530
A'ight.

01:27:18.532 --> 01:27:21.466
Adam won the coin toss,
so it's two minutes on Behn.

01:27:21.468 --> 01:27:23.037
Let's work.

01:27:24.237 --> 01:27:26.640
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about!

01:27:38.018 --> 01:27:41.587
They talkin' wild out here,
like I ain't better than

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:43.989
my own protégé /

01:27:43.991 --> 01:27:47.558
Well, you and Megaton
both takin' Ls tonight,

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.630
'cause he ain't even
a pro to Che!

01:27:52.832 --> 01:27:57.335
And as for Adam, the mack'll
more (Macklemore) than hurt him,

01:27:57.337 --> 01:27:59.637
you'll get lowered into
an open grave /

01:27:59.639 --> 01:28:01.039
You thrift shoppin'...

01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:04.442
you get put in a suit
off some throwaways /

01:28:04.444 --> 01:28:06.844
Red-headed
bitches is freaks,

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:10.414
'cause me and his mom
known to get wild /

01:28:10.416 --> 01:28:11.783
It's more than a metaphor

01:28:11.785 --> 01:28:15.219
when I treat this
redhead like my stepchild

01:28:15.221 --> 01:28:16.387
He smashed your mom?

01:28:16.389 --> 01:28:17.856
Look at his face!
Look at his face!

01:28:17.858 --> 01:28:20.258
And we didn't even
make it to the room,

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.892
I smashed her in the lobby/

01:28:21.894 --> 01:28:23.895
I'm like a priest at
the communion,

01:28:23.897 --> 01:28:27.001
I'll turn this
cracker into a body!/

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:33.038
He performs spoken word,
so after I slam this poet

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.408
he'll feel back in his prime /
'Cause I ain't gotta clap him,

01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:39.276
I just snap him after
his lines /

01:28:39.278 --> 01:28:42.079
So it was never really right
to call this cat a rookie /

01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:45.216
You know spoken word
is like a dental dam...

01:28:45.218 --> 01:28:48.022
it's just a (w)rap for pussies /

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:54.159
His mom and dad is rich,

01:28:54.161 --> 01:28:56.994
so if we rob him it's more
than snatchin' a chain /

01:28:56.996 --> 01:28:58.864
I'll hit him with the silver
spoon so far back

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:02.303
in his mouth, he gets
stabbed in the brain /

01:29:05.471 --> 01:29:07.371
I'll revoke your hood pass,

01:29:07.373 --> 01:29:09.341
make sure you not
good in here /

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:11.008
His last name is Merkin,

01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:14.846
so you know we got a
fake pussy here (hair)!/

01:29:14.848 --> 01:29:17.716
You a culture thief,
a vulture, a leech /

01:29:17.718 --> 01:29:20.185
Why you usin' the voice
that black people use

01:29:20.187 --> 01:29:23.088
to talk to police? /

01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:25.423
You grew up at Broadway
and Park Place,

01:29:25.425 --> 01:29:27.025
you not in these streets /

01:29:27.027 --> 01:29:32.164
I'll put the iron to this square
like a Monopoly piece! /

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:35.834
He so mad he can't be
black that he's bitter /

01:29:35.836 --> 01:29:38.302
When teachers asked what he
wanna be when he grew up,

01:29:38.304 --> 01:29:41.775
he answered, "A nigga." /

01:29:44.444 --> 01:29:48.112
So, outta spite,
he became a Klansman,

01:29:48.114 --> 01:29:51.016
but black men is what
this faggot is in-ta /

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.517
How you K. K. K.

01:29:52.519 --> 01:29:54.285
when you fuck black men?

01:29:54.287 --> 01:29:58.292
You the Kardashian sisters! /

01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:01.793
All your shit
for Pro was racist,

01:30:01.795 --> 01:30:04.462
but you say you NOT racist?

01:30:04.464 --> 01:30:06.030
That's some crazy stuff /

01:30:06.032 --> 01:30:07.298
This nigga start every sentence

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:11.771
he ever say with
"I hate to be racist, but... "/

01:30:12.839 --> 01:30:15.106
You a high-in-salt type cracker,

01:30:15.108 --> 01:30:17.308
when I'm done with this
soft white rapper /

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:23.116
He'll be online after typin'
"All Lives Matter!"

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.254
Make some noise!

01:30:32.759 --> 01:30:35.696
Black lives matter, Adam!

01:30:37.764 --> 01:30:39.698
You said my mom's a whore?

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:42.670
Yeah, he did say that.

01:30:45.805 --> 01:30:47.239
Well, you're right.

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:49.740
So it's time you got
some viral shots /

01:30:49.742 --> 01:30:52.009
'Cause if it burns
when you piss now,

01:30:52.011 --> 01:30:54.713
you know why they call
her a fire-crotch!

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:57.216
He fuckin' you up already, man.

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:58.616
That boy don't play.

01:30:58.618 --> 01:31:01.285
What, you thought since
I'm a white boy

01:31:01.287 --> 01:31:02.987
that he would scare me pale? /

01:31:02.989 --> 01:31:05.255
You can't rep
the brothers Grym,

01:31:05.257 --> 01:31:07.292
your life is a fairy tale

01:31:07.294 --> 01:31:10.862
Wow, Brother Grym.

01:31:10.864 --> 01:31:13.798
You and your wife are on
some Boy Meets World shit,

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.165
and she's at best average /

01:31:15.167 --> 01:31:17.002
You've been with one
bitch your whole life,

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.974
don't try to tell me Behn's
savage (Ben Savage) /

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:23.908
He doesn't have a set
he's bangin',

01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:26.712
he was busy wedding plannin' /

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:28.079
How're you gonna make that

01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:32.052
bitch Topanga when her pussy
looks like Topanga Canyon!

01:31:32.818 --> 01:31:34.386
Is that shit true?

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:36.420
You only been
with one bitch?

01:31:36.422 --> 01:31:37.355
Nigga!

01:31:37.357 --> 01:31:39.289
You need to experience life!

01:31:39.291 --> 01:31:41.660
Fuck the guns you say
you pack man (Pac-Man),

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.128
me and your Miss are
knockin' boots /

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:44.896
And when I'm done
I might kill that prostitute

01:31:44.898 --> 01:31:48.600
like I'm trying to
keep my Grand Theft Auto loot /

01:31:48.602 --> 01:31:50.133
Yeah, she swallows too,

01:31:50.135 --> 01:31:52.870
she's like Kirby how she
inhales every drop /

01:31:52.872 --> 01:31:54.873
Then I'll do her like
Metal Gear and put

01:31:54.875 --> 01:31:57.877
my Solid Snake in her box!/

01:31:58.745 --> 01:32:00.878
You don't own a sole Calibre,

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.149
if you control-a (controller)
gun it's Nintendo brand/

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:06.049
That's why the block won't
feel/fill your lines

01:32:06.051 --> 01:32:07.753
like you're in a Tetris jam /

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:09.486
Where you pulling weapons from?

01:32:09.488 --> 01:32:10.722
'Cause you got punked

01:32:10.724 --> 01:32:12.790
by Megaton without a TEC
in (Tekken) hand /

01:32:12.792 --> 01:32:14.159
If you really had
those big arms,

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:17.797
you would've taken
a shot at Mega man! /

01:32:20.733 --> 01:32:22.734
I know you're probably
wondering why I designed

01:32:22.736 --> 01:32:25.372
these bars about video games
for my writtens...

01:32:32.144 --> 01:32:34.512
It's 'cause this
motherfucker designs

01:32:34.514 --> 01:32:36.614
video games for a livin'!/

01:32:36.616 --> 01:32:37.818
What?

01:32:40.487 --> 01:32:41.786
Tell them the truth,

01:32:41.788 --> 01:32:43.387
tell them these gun bars
are just bluffing for fame /

01:32:43.389 --> 01:32:45.123
Tell them what you really
mean when you say

01:32:45.125 --> 01:32:46.723
you're making money
from the game!

01:32:46.725 --> 01:32:48.026
You ain't going
hard in the gutter,

01:32:48.028 --> 01:32:49.893
you're dealing with
marketing numbers /

01:32:49.895 --> 01:32:52.030
If you got fire
power from the pipe

01:32:52.032 --> 01:32:54.835
you're playing Mario Brothers /

01:32:58.238 --> 01:33:00.873
The closest thing
you get to beef

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:04.107
is when kids on X-Box
trash talk to each other /

01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:06.011
The closest you
get to pimpin'

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:10.785
is when you come home and tell
your daughter you love her! /

01:33:13.819 --> 01:33:17.621
Oh, shit,
y'all didn't know?

01:33:17.623 --> 01:33:19.357
Yeah, he's a family man /

01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:21.660
So if he's talking
about sharing cells,

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:22.692
it ain't jail,

01:33:22.694 --> 01:33:25.265
he's just got a family plan /

01:33:26.064 --> 01:33:27.632
So I'm exposing my own friend,

01:33:27.634 --> 01:33:29.033
I'm on that white devil shit /

01:33:29.035 --> 01:33:30.601
I just showed this game designer

01:33:30.603 --> 01:33:33.373
what the next level is!

01:33:37.344 --> 01:33:39.645
Sorry, my nigga, but if what
he sayin' true,

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:41.980
we riding with
the REAL gangster.

01:33:41.982 --> 01:33:44.283
Ain't finna be over here
catching no stray shrapnel

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:45.283
for no frog man?

01:33:45.285 --> 01:33:48.786
Y'all switching sides?
Y'all switching sides?

01:33:48.788 --> 01:33:50.955
Aw man, that's cold, bruh.

01:33:50.957 --> 01:33:53.591
Ey Grym, you wanna
pass the controller,

01:33:53.593 --> 01:33:56.762
or you got something for
Adam mister video game man?

01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:59.364
So you wanna diss my wife?

01:33:59.366 --> 01:34:03.401
Cool, I guess I gotta let
you know what's up /

01:34:03.403 --> 01:34:05.703
For comin' at-her-I'll
(Adderall) have bullets

01:34:05.705 --> 01:34:07.940
riddlin' (Ritalin)
your frame, nigga,

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.807
now focus up!

01:34:09.809 --> 01:34:12.877
I'm a Beast to this Boy,
I'll shoot at his team

01:34:12.879 --> 01:34:14.145
and clap whoever /

01:34:14.147 --> 01:34:17.080
MCA, Ad-Rock
...Adam'll either die first

01:34:17.082 --> 01:34:20.019
or lose his man forever /

01:34:22.688 --> 01:34:24.955
They say he'd kill me,

01:34:24.957 --> 01:34:27.726
it's over him the priest
say "Amen" /

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:29.627
The tables is turned,
they mo(u)rning

01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:33.263
Adam like he DJ AM! /

01:34:33.265 --> 01:34:36.433
Your girl dumped you
over some battle rap shit,

01:34:36.435 --> 01:34:38.869
that's a true story, B /

01:34:38.871 --> 01:34:42.673
So you lost some pussy
to win a battle?

01:34:42.675 --> 01:34:46.179
Only thing fucked is
your priorities

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.512
He got a point.

01:34:48.514 --> 01:34:49.981
And her name is Maya,
like the people who worshipped

01:34:49.983 --> 01:34:51.350
gods with savage rites /

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:54.185
So it's only right that Maya
ripped his heart out

01:34:54.187 --> 01:34:56.887
like a human sacrifice! /

01:34:56.889 --> 01:35:01.092
His dad's a famous writer,
so wherever you go

01:35:01.094 --> 01:35:02.860
his shadow hits you./

01:35:02.862 --> 01:35:05.364
What a surprise...
another white bitch

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:07.301
with daddy issues /

01:35:08.835 --> 01:35:10.535
They say you a dope writer,

01:35:10.537 --> 01:35:13.638
but you not the best in
your family, is you?/

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.539
Shit, if he was to
battle with you,

01:35:15.541 --> 01:35:19.512
you'd be Marvin Gaye...
your old man would KILL you! /

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.080
You a Shermanator impersonator,

01:35:23.082 --> 01:35:26.116
walkin' around here with
you panties tangled /

01:35:26.118 --> 01:35:27.819
Corniest red-headed bitch in rap

01:35:27.821 --> 01:35:31.423
since Jay flipped
the Annie sample/

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:33.357
We both got treated
like disease

01:35:33.359 --> 01:35:36.360
cause society didn't like us /A

01:35:36.362 --> 01:35:37.596
Well fuck that...

01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:42.036
I'd rather have nigger-itis
than ginger-vitis! /

01:35:45.238 --> 01:35:49.975
It was that one time I let
you try sayin' "nigga" fast/

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:52.910
But it really don't matter
if you get a Nigga Pass

01:35:52.912 --> 01:35:55.446
if you ain't felt
a nigga's past!

01:35:55.448 --> 01:35:58.616
If we was to go around
and start killing crackers,

01:35:58.618 --> 01:36:01.619
I'm coming to your college
where you chill son /

01:36:01.621 --> 01:36:04.789
You thought we wouldn't get
revenge for Mike Brown,

01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:07.092
I'll catch you
there and will son.

01:36:09.095 --> 01:36:09.994
Black lives matter!

01:36:09.996 --> 01:36:12.332
Black lives matter!

01:36:13.332 --> 01:36:15.467
He did a school
project on battle rap,

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:19.436
that's the only reason his
hoass got to talk to me /

01:36:19.438 --> 01:36:25.109
So here's my interview
answer, Adam: "EAT A DICK"...

01:36:25.111 --> 01:36:28.748
and you better
quote that properly!!!

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.049
Now we got a battle!

01:36:32.051 --> 01:36:33.183
Now we got a battle!

01:36:33.185 --> 01:36:34.819
Behn Grym got
his balls back.

01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:37.755
I, I, I man, it's back
on my white boy.

01:36:37.757 --> 01:36:39.559
Let's finish this motherfucker!

01:36:42.595 --> 01:36:43.962
You wanna get personal?

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:45.362
Let's get personal...

01:36:45.364 --> 01:36:49.834
His real name is Osiris,
that's the Egyptian death god /

01:36:49.836 --> 01:36:51.435
Whose wife is
Isis... which is perfect,

01:36:51.437 --> 01:36:55.472
cause if he's home late she'll
take his fucking head off!/

01:36:55.474 --> 01:36:57.408
So yeah my bitch
ripped my heart out,

01:36:57.410 --> 01:37:00.610
at least that's the only
body part I have gone /

01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:01.679
Your bitch?

01:37:01.681 --> 01:37:03.880
Call her LeBron with how
easy she keeps your balls

01:37:03.882 --> 01:37:05.184
in her palm!

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.585
She's a stuck-up cunt,

01:37:08.587 --> 01:37:12.323
wherever they go
she makes him pay /

01:37:12.325 --> 01:37:14.725
The way you stunt to
stay in the box,

01:37:14.727 --> 01:37:16.026
it's like you're David Blaine/

01:37:17.163 --> 01:37:18.797
I just wonder what your
ancestors

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.164
who were slaves
would say /

01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:22.299
Cause you get cuffed and
whipped by the ball and

01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:24.670
chain till you're Fifty
Shades of Grey!

01:37:25.938 --> 01:37:27.804
Yo, he's goin' IN on wifey!

01:37:27.806 --> 01:37:32.310
Hey, man. Holla at me later, I
know a good divorce lawyer, baby.

01:37:32.312 --> 01:37:36.580
But for real, I respect how
having a family changed

01:37:36.582 --> 01:37:38.016
your life's focus/

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:41.721
Especially after your kid was
diagnosed with cystic fibrosis /

01:37:43.489 --> 01:37:46.190
That's why you did this battle,

01:37:46.192 --> 01:37:48.362
to pay for her care
with the funds /

01:37:49.328 --> 01:37:51.431
So you're putting food
on her plate...

01:37:55.367 --> 01:37:59.837
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T
PUT AIR IN HER LUNGS! /

01:37:59.839 --> 01:38:01.472
With Every
Breath She Takes,

01:38:01.474 --> 01:38:05.142
she feels the Sting like
it's hard labor /

01:38:05.144 --> 01:38:06.878
She sounds like Darth
Vader choking

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.414
to death on a jawbreaker /

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:12.551
The shit she coughs up looks
like an abstract painting,

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:16.154
she'll probably be
an art major /

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:18.722
She can't do the most
basic parts of living,

01:38:18.724 --> 01:38:21.225
it's obvious God hates her!

01:38:27.767 --> 01:38:31.802
And now your battle career
is finished running its course /

01:38:31.804 --> 01:38:34.204
It's like your daughter...
gasping for breath

01:38:34.206 --> 01:38:36.740
and always coming up short /

01:38:36.742 --> 01:38:37.741
You hate the things other men

01:38:37.743 --> 01:38:39.910
would love to hear
from their daughters /

01:38:39.912 --> 01:38:42.547
Like when she tells you you're
the air that she breathes,

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:46.317
it means you're a
terrible father! /

01:38:46.319 --> 01:38:48.985
So I'll blow my secondhand
smoke all in her face,

01:38:48.987 --> 01:38:49.987
and it's not a mistake/

01:38:49.989 --> 01:38:51.254
Then I'll flick my
cigarette at her

01:38:51.256 --> 01:38:53.524
fucking oxygen tank! /

01:38:53.526 --> 01:38:56.695
And the gene for her disease
is mostly found in white men /

01:38:56.697 --> 01:39:00.198
So you should have some
questions for your wife then,

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:04.668
like "why the fuck is
she so light-skinned?"

01:39:06.171 --> 01:39:07.905
Let me see your "you're
not the father" dance!

01:39:07.907 --> 01:39:09.810
Let me see it man!

01:39:18.417 --> 01:39:19.851
She came out the pussy
pre-approved

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:21.622
for a mortgage.

01:39:23.656 --> 01:39:26.691
Yo, shut the fuck up
when I'm rapping!

01:39:29.328 --> 01:39:30.460
You're trying to
be my hypeman,

01:39:30.462 --> 01:39:32.730
I'd rather make you
cannon fodder /

01:39:32.732 --> 01:39:34.632
I could beat you in
a two-on-two match

01:39:34.634 --> 01:39:37.371
if I had his daughter
as my partner!

01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:39.169
Chill out, bro.

01:39:39.171 --> 01:39:40.405
We was bigging you up.

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:41.638
No you shut the fuck up.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.873
You're talking
during my rounds.

01:39:42.875 --> 01:39:43.740
And about his daughter.

01:39:43.742 --> 01:39:45.409
Yo, YOU talking
about his daughter!

01:39:45.411 --> 01:39:46.310
What you talkin' 'bout?

01:39:46.312 --> 01:39:47.044
Yeah, but we was in a battle.

01:39:47.046 --> 01:39:48.980
Y'all just TALKING.

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:49.813
Keep it rap.

01:39:49.815 --> 01:39:51.548
Keep it rap!

01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:53.284
We can be in a fuckin' battle,

01:39:53.286 --> 01:39:54.218
if you want.

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.052
Since y'all on
the same side,

01:39:55.054 --> 01:39:56.052
all of a sudden.

01:39:56.054 --> 01:39:57.222
You're calling
us out to battle?

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.056
Right now?

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.089
If you feel a type of way.

01:39:59.091 --> 01:40:00.357
Yeah we feel
some type of way,

01:40:00.359 --> 01:40:01.959
you talking about my
motherfucking daughter man.

01:40:01.961 --> 01:40:02.860
Let's do it then, nigga.

01:40:02.862 --> 01:40:03.962
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout.

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:07.999
This is some old school
battle type shit, okay.

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:10.234
We 'bout to have a
freestyle battle,

01:40:10.236 --> 01:40:11.235
OFF THE TOP.

01:40:11.237 --> 01:40:14.137
No rules, no time limits.

01:40:14.139 --> 01:40:16.576
Make some noise for that!

01:40:19.545 --> 01:40:22.079
Now 40 and Bluntz, since
y'all called them out,

01:40:22.081 --> 01:40:23.114

01:40:23.116 --> 01:40:24.382
Were always man.

01:40:24.384 --> 01:40:25.819
Let's get it in then.

01:40:28.955 --> 01:40:30.221
Adam, right?

01:40:30.223 --> 01:40:32.190
You been soft half your life /

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:34.691
I should grab your
mics and Jackson,

01:40:34.693 --> 01:40:38.661
it Don't Matter
If You're Black or White

01:40:38.663 --> 01:40:43.100
Right now I'm blackin' like
Amistad on this fake G-Eazy /

01:40:43.102 --> 01:40:44.902

mama's fried...

01:40:44.904 --> 01:40:46.436
Dollar fries!

01:40:46.438 --> 01:40:48.138
You been piggin' out
in these battles, huh?

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.673
But you ain't get the scoop?

01:40:49.675 --> 01:40:50.607

01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:53.714
And anybody hoggin'

01:40:56.349 --> 01:40:57.816

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:01.918
Fake Renegades,

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.655
Centre stage, and I slay,

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:06.994

You definitely
gon' get this work!

01:41:12.297 --> 01:41:14.766
You started rapping
a couple days ago,

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:19.006
and YOU make games
for Playstation Fo' /

01:41:19.772 --> 01:41:20.704
But his gun?

01:41:20.706 --> 01:41:23.574
Playstation One,
you gotta wait to load.

01:41:23.576 --> 01:41:25.442
Y'all team seem iffy...

01:41:25.444 --> 01:41:28.146
That's cause they theme
scream "Disney" /

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:32.717
His jeans scream "hippie" and
his cheeks scream "pinch me" /

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:33.752
They a couple!

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:34.753
They a COUPLE?

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:35.686
That's what I heard.

01:41:35.688 --> 01:41:37.620
So in this battle y'all
really fought /

01:41:37.622 --> 01:41:42.493
Tonight it's gonna be some real
awkward pillow talk.

01:41:42.495 --> 01:41:44.494
Nah, nah, nah,
they an odd couple,

01:41:44.496 --> 01:41:45.929
that's why they not even /

01:41:45.931 --> 01:41:48.833
And if you talk about my
daughter in this battle,

01:41:48.835 --> 01:41:51.168
you'll be the one
that's not breathin',

01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:52.302
motherfucker!

01:41:57.242 --> 01:41:59.412
Okay, okay.

01:42:05.518 --> 01:42:08.852
You're both so emotional,
you talk shit then bitch and

01:42:08.854 --> 01:42:10.420
whine 'cause I replied? /

01:42:10.422 --> 01:42:12.390
I guess this is the Future
Drake wanted...

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:15.526
What A Time To Be Alive!

01:42:15.528 --> 01:42:17.227
These rounds'll
leave ya bleedin',

01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:19.463
then let's see how
they can talk /

01:42:19.465 --> 01:42:21.766
So it's not one for the
dead homies when they see

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:23.767
that 40 pouring
out on the block!

01:42:23.769 --> 01:42:25.302
You don't need
'caine to move,

01:42:25.304 --> 01:42:27.471
you need canes to move,
you old hasbeens /

01:42:27.473 --> 01:42:29.173
Can't even watch your
own matches without

01:42:29.175 --> 01:42:32.410
turning on closed captions.

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:35.012
Both arms in they face,
look like they both dabbin'

01:42:35.014 --> 01:42:37.015
And even though I'm white
I'll (White Owl) light

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:38.749
Bluntz up... Cause we don't
feel he (Phillie)

01:42:38.751 --> 01:42:40.418
got the flavor for
dope rappin'!!!

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:44.422
See they pull up, I spot 'em
then I stretch 'em like

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:45.623
a personal trainer/

01:42:45.625 --> 01:42:47.290
Then I lift they soul up...

01:42:47.292 --> 01:42:48.691
Like it's a
personal savior!

01:42:48.693 --> 01:42:51.728
I'm not tryna say all that
...It's my personal favor.

01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:53.597
I'm tryna let
these shells out early,

01:42:53.599 --> 01:42:56.535
they got perfect behavior!

01:42:58.537 --> 01:42:59.936
Y'all are moving
where you're not wanted,

01:42:59.938 --> 01:43:03.040
that's how I know what it
feels like to be gentrified.

01:43:03.042 --> 01:43:05.042
How you gonna raise your
fist at me like you ain't

01:43:05.044 --> 01:43:06.576
got a sense of pride? /

01:43:06.578 --> 01:43:09.045
I'm not hatin',
I'm just sayin' you on that

01:43:09.047 --> 01:43:10.448
transgender vibe /

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:11.582
The way you switchin' sides,

01:43:11.584 --> 01:43:14.352
I can see the bitch inside

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.993
You're a bitch Mag,

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:25.329
all you do is talk gossip
shit and weight loss

01:43:25.331 --> 01:43:27.164
'Cause that's the only way
these niggas'd

01:43:27.166 --> 01:43:28.399
get some flames off

01:43:28.401 --> 01:43:31.134
Is if we did a face swap!

01:43:31.136 --> 01:43:32.035
Why are you wearing jewelry?

01:43:32.037 --> 01:43:33.103
You don't supply drugs

01:43:33.105 --> 01:43:34.405
And why are you wearing that...

01:43:34.407 --> 01:43:35.740
When you're the one
who looks like

01:43:35.742 --> 01:43:38.745
he got shocked by a plug! /

01:43:42.915 --> 01:43:45.917
I'm Eminem cause I'm white
and can rhyme???

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:48.985
Nah, if we talkin' history,
that's Pac and that's Biggie...

01:43:48.987 --> 01:43:50.320
the only tragedy is that

01:43:50.322 --> 01:43:52.656
they DIDN'T die
in their prime...

01:43:52.658 --> 01:43:54.059
TIME!

01:44:02.667 --> 01:44:05.169
Adam, that was crazy man.

01:44:05.171 --> 01:44:06.904
I always knew you
was nice with it,

01:44:06.906 --> 01:44:09.440
but I never knew you
went hard like that.

01:44:09.442 --> 01:44:11.241
Phew. Wow.

01:44:11.243 --> 01:44:12.711
Respect.

01:44:13.479 --> 01:44:14.511
The Yo!

01:44:14.513 --> 01:44:16.079
That DAUGHTER shit man.

01:44:16.081 --> 01:44:18.115
When you said you'd
blow up her oxygen tank?

01:44:18.117 --> 01:44:19.450
That shit was crazy as fuck.

01:44:19.452 --> 01:44:20.685
That's why I watch rap battles!

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.386
You bodied his
entire family!

01:44:22.388 --> 01:44:23.590
Respect.

01:44:25.257 --> 01:44:26.857
That battle was awesome.

01:44:26.859 --> 01:44:27.959
That two-on-two?

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:30.294
People are going to be
talking about that forever.

01:44:30.296 --> 01:44:31.897
We should do
some more of those.

01:44:32.532 --> 01:44:35.098
If the paper's right.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.768
If shit got that
heated between friends,

01:44:37.770 --> 01:44:40.538
imagine what's gonna happen
when we actually put two people

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.076
in the ring who don't
really fuck with each other.

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:46.677
That's exactly
what's about to happen,

01:44:46.679 --> 01:44:49.946
because the main event of
the epoch is going down

01:44:49.948 --> 01:44:52.016
right NOW.

01:44:52.018 --> 01:44:54.520
I'm glad we're cool after
all the shit that I said.

01:44:55.787 --> 01:44:58.021
But... it's battle rap.

01:44:58.023 --> 01:44:59.625
I knew you'd understand.

01:45:00.192 --> 01:45:02.026
Yeah I understand.

01:45:02.028 --> 01:45:03.628
We ain't cool, though.

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.663
The gun'll interrupt
him on stage,

01:45:05.665 --> 01:45:08.268
I'll grab the
Mag-n-Yeezy him.

01:45:09.969 --> 01:45:11.102
Oh, my god.

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:12.205
Y'all get it?

01:45:13.139 --> 01:45:14.905
Iron, minerals, magnesium.

01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:17.542
Interrupt him on stage,
grab the mag and fuckin'

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:18.944
YEEZY him?

01:45:19.745 --> 01:45:21.445
Y'all need to
wake the fuck up.

01:45:21.447 --> 01:45:22.646
You the only one tired.

01:45:22.648 --> 01:45:25.216
What about the two-on-two?

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:26.549
We killed it up there.

01:45:26.551 --> 01:45:28.585
We cool on some rap shit.

01:45:28.587 --> 01:45:29.853
I respect your artistry.

01:45:29.855 --> 01:45:31.688
You can put together some bars.

01:45:31.690 --> 01:45:33.792
But we ain't friends.

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:38.594
But, it's battle rap.

01:45:38.596 --> 01:45:41.298
You said a bunch of
personal stuff about me.

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.533
Anything goes in
a battle, right?

01:45:42.535 --> 01:45:43.968
Yeah, anything goes.

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:46.137
But you think your
words don't have fucking

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:47.204
consequences?

01:45:47.206 --> 01:45:49.440
Everybody calling you out
on your shit... my girl.

01:45:49.442 --> 01:45:50.406
Your girl.

01:45:50.408 --> 01:45:51.808
The whole Berkeley student body.

01:45:51.810 --> 01:45:54.544
You keep telling yourself
that they just don't understand,

01:45:54.546 --> 01:45:57.017
so you can feel like
a good person.

01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:59.318
What you need to realize:

01:46:00.452 --> 01:46:04.323
you're not. You are
not a good person.

01:46:05.457 --> 01:46:07.126
You're a degenerate scumbag.

01:46:08.461 --> 01:46:09.930
This is where you belong.

01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:16.169
Where are you going?

01:46:19.438 --> 01:46:20.606
Where I belong.

01:46:21.273 --> 01:46:22.675
Home.
With my family.

01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:29.679
You a muthafuckin' legend, bro!

01:46:29.681 --> 01:46:31.481
Legends respect legends.

01:46:31.483 --> 01:46:33.285
Keep doing your thing.

01:46:39.992 --> 01:46:42.558
A'ight, a'ight, ain't I ain't
fuckin' with that?

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.494
I know what y'all want.

01:46:43.496 --> 01:46:45.131
Check this out
camel-breeder:

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:47.964
Your ho ain't loyal,

01:46:47.966 --> 01:46:51.301
she don't care a bit
motherfucker /

01:46:51.303 --> 01:46:53.503
THAT'S WHY I FUCKED YO BITCH,

01:46:53.505 --> 01:46:55.306
YOU ARABIC MOTHERFUCKER! /

01:46:57.876 --> 01:46:59.543
You walked in on us fuckin',

01:46:59.545 --> 01:47:01.678
she still tried to tell "baby,

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.114
I'm just flirtin'" /

01:47:03.116 --> 01:47:04.080
She a porn star,

01:47:04.082 --> 01:47:06.583
she took out the
camera and said "baby,

01:47:06.585 --> 01:47:08.989
I'm just workin'!"

01:47:09.855 --> 01:47:11.621
TIME!

01:47:11.623 --> 01:47:13.723
Mega, it's on you.

01:47:13.725 --> 01:47:16.127
Que paso mijo,
I'm 'bout to murder

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:17.393
you in front
of your own people /

01:47:17.395 --> 01:47:18.561
Grab the chrome Eagle

01:47:18.563 --> 01:47:20.700
and do a drive-by in front
of Home Depot /

01:47:21.767 --> 01:47:23.033
I don't give a fuck if you're

01:47:23.035 --> 01:47:25.701
from El Salvador
or Puerto Rico,

01:47:25.703 --> 01:47:27.237
that don't matter to me bro /

01:47:27.239 --> 01:47:28.806
Cause if you can pack 44

01:47:28.808 --> 01:47:31.607
of your folks and your close
amigos in a little four-door

01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:34.344
Pinto... then you're Latino /

01:47:34.346 --> 01:47:35.579
You think I give a fuck if

01:47:35.581 --> 01:47:36.916
you and my bitch date?

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:39.783
And I heard y'all kissed,
well that was your mistake/

01:47:39.785 --> 01:47:41.852
'Cause now you can tell
everybody in the crowd

01:47:41.854 --> 01:47:43.389
how my dick tastes /

01:47:44.756 --> 01:47:46.757
So
what you fucked my bitch?

01:47:46.759 --> 01:47:47.958
So did everyone else /

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:50.293
And she said you had
a small dick...

01:47:50.295 --> 01:47:54.333
matter fact, I'ma have
her tell you herself!

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:03.406
Yo!

01:48:03.408 --> 01:48:05.709
Yes I fucked this pussy,
and yes I'm a porn star

01:48:05.711 --> 01:48:06.709
if you can't tell /

01:48:06.711 --> 01:48:08.945
I'd say he satisfied me,

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:12.252
but I can't even fake
it that well /

01:48:13.519 --> 01:48:15.185
To have a below-average dick,

01:48:15.187 --> 01:48:17.323
you'd need to be a
couple inches bigger /

01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:20.457
Yo, you thought we was fucking?

01:48:20.459 --> 01:48:22.560
I thought I was being fingered

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:31.334
This better be good, Adam.

01:48:31.336 --> 01:48:33.771
Hey, ba... Maya.

01:48:33.773 --> 01:48:35.371
Thanks for picking up.

01:48:35.373 --> 01:48:36.807
I know it's late.

01:48:36.809 --> 01:48:39.709
And I'm also probably the
last person you expected to

01:48:39.711 --> 01:48:41.344
or wanted to
talk to right now.

01:48:41.346 --> 01:48:44.248
But there's just something
I really need to say to you.

01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:48.017
So please, just listen.

01:48:48.019 --> 01:48:49.520
This shit is
fuckin' rigged,

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:52.021
you're gonna just let him
walk in with special fuckin'

01:48:52.023 --> 01:48:52.589
guests?

01:48:52.591 --> 01:48:53.891
This is the wave now?

01:48:53.893 --> 01:48:56.459
Fuckin' with guest
fuckin' verses?

01:48:56.461 --> 01:48:57.727
This is some bullshit, man.

01:48:57.729 --> 01:48:58.762
Fuck that.

01:48:58.764 --> 01:49:00.464
I'm out this bitch.

01:49:00.466 --> 01:49:01.732
You lost anyway!

01:49:01.734 --> 01:49:03.433
I completely understand
why you did what you did,

01:49:03.435 --> 01:49:05.201
with the PowerPoint.

01:49:05.203 --> 01:49:06.939
And I forgive you.

01:49:07.773 --> 01:49:10.207
I deserve it, even.

01:49:10.209 --> 01:49:11.409
I was so terrible.

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:14.980
To you, to our friends,
to the whole world.

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:22.922
What I've realized is
...you were right.

01:49:23.989 --> 01:49:25.522
When you said
that this wasn't me.

01:49:25.524 --> 01:49:26.824
I'm not this person.

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:28.361
I'm not like those guys.

01:49:29.895 --> 01:49:33.996
The best version of myself,
the real version of myself,

01:49:33.998 --> 01:49:35.769
is when I was with you.

01:49:37.537 --> 01:49:39.439
You make me a
better person.

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:41.373
You make me me.

01:49:43.375 --> 01:49:46.078
Maya, I want to be with
you for the rest of my life.

01:49:47.479 --> 01:49:53.987
With no more time off
or mistakes or wrong directions.

01:49:55.787 --> 01:49:59.489
Maya, what I'm trying
to say is...

01:49:59.491 --> 01:50:01.027
will you marry me?

01:50:01.926 --> 01:50:04.163
You want to get married?

01:50:05.063 --> 01:50:06.362
Yes, yes!

01:50:06.364 --> 01:50:08.468
More than anything
else in the world,

01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:10.036
yes.

01:50:11.636 --> 01:50:13.369
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR
FUCKING MIND?!!

01:50:13.371 --> 01:50:14.739
Delete my number,

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:18.674
you fucking racist
misogynist homophobic fuck!

01:50:18.676 --> 01:50:20.479
And stay the
FUCK away from me!

01:50:24.082 --> 01:50:25.949
My opponent quit
like a coward,

01:50:25.951 --> 01:50:28.352
so I guess I gotta start
killin' his squad /

01:50:28.354 --> 01:50:30.454
Starting with this
bitch over here

01:50:30.456 --> 01:50:32.158
looking like Biggie Minaj /

01:50:33.759 --> 01:50:35.625
Ho you look like Rah Digga...

01:50:35.627 --> 01:50:36.627
Bitch I will bury your ass!

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:38.896
If she was crossed
with Godzilla! /

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:41.798
A white dude, an Asian,
a black girl,

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.833
and a Mexican /

01:50:42.835 --> 01:50:44.500
Who the fuck y'all
supposed to be,

01:50:44.502 --> 01:50:46.002
the United Colors of Benetton? /

01:50:46.004 --> 01:50:47.704
Man, it's like the rap version

01:50:47.706 --> 01:50:49.306
- of the Village People...
- Chill, chill!

01:50:49.308 --> 01:50:52.642
Get the fuck

01:50:52.644 --> 01:50:54.410
Anyone of you motherfucks.

01:50:54.412 --> 01:50:55.980
Little punk-ass chumps.

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:58.582
I'll battle any
of y'all at once.

01:50:58.584 --> 01:50:59.650
Tell Behn what's up!

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:01.918
What's up Mag,

I'll fuck both of you up!

01:51:03.422 --> 01:51:04.088
It's another 40 Mag.

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:05.623
He ain't talkin' about me.

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:06.755
Y'all ain't nothing but chumps.

01:51:06.757 --> 01:51:07.924
Every single one of you fucks.

01:51:07.926 --> 01:51:10.026
I thought Adam you
was a freestyler, right?

01:51:10.028 --> 01:51:11.628
Well show me what's up.

01:51:11.630 --> 01:51:13.530
C'mon bitch show me what's up,

01:51:13.532 --> 01:51:15.164

Let's get it you
geeky-ass dweeb.

01:51:16.902 --> 01:51:19.102
You little dick
suckin' McLovin.

01:51:19.104 --> 01:51:21.538
Come show me some of
those freestyles, fuck boy.

01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:25.743
Man, I ain't the fuckin' kid
to step to/ You see this?

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:28.811
It's that look you have on your
face when you've been crying

01:51:28.813 --> 01:51:31.115
all day because your bitch
just left you/

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:33.683
Maybe it's cause she found
your Boy George tapes

01:51:33.685 --> 01:51:35.285
and realized you go both ways /

01:51:35.287 --> 01:51:37.722
Or maybe it's no one
wants to procreate

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.255
with your Macaulay
Caulkin traits /

01:51:39.257 --> 01:51:40.923
And have a kid born one day

01:51:40.925 --> 01:51:43.360
with the same pointy nose
and ovalshaped /

01:51:43.362 --> 01:51:46.996
Topher Grace slash Norman
Bates looking bony face /

01:51:46.998 --> 01:51:50.234
They got me all the way out
here in the Golden State /

01:51:50.236 --> 01:51:51.869
Battling with the same
little white bitch

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:53.973
that Tupac and Kobe raped! /

01:51:57.542 --> 01:52:00.076
Before this cracker learned
about the Black Panthers

01:52:00.078 --> 01:52:01.610
through his dad's lectures /

01:52:01.612 --> 01:52:03.347
He wanted to be a Klan member

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:04.681
but he found out
he can't enter /

01:52:04.683 --> 01:52:07.353
'Cause they didn't accept
people who are transgender /

01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:10.654
For setting this up,
fuck you too,

01:52:10.656 --> 01:52:12.088
I don't trust you either /

01:52:12.090 --> 01:52:13.390
You should know the only reason

01:52:13.392 --> 01:52:15.426
he wants to be here is cause
he got jungle fever /

01:52:15.428 --> 01:52:19.562
Looking like Justin Bieber
in a fucking muscle T-shirt /

01:52:19.564 --> 01:52:23.467
You're a fuckin' fan of Hanson,
Marilyn Manson's grandson /

01:52:23.469 --> 01:52:26.102
This is a bodybag that you
ain't coming back from,

01:52:26.104 --> 01:52:28.705
straight up-
Shut the fuck up!

01:52:32.944 --> 01:52:34.177
You think you're
a super villain?

01:52:34.179 --> 01:52:36.346
I'm about to tear
your mask off /

01:52:36.348 --> 01:52:39.548
'Cause now you're talkin' to the
devil like Ivan Karamazov /

01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:42.552
You think cause you're a
"terrorist martyr Arabic scholar

01:52:42.554 --> 01:52:44.821
preparing for Allah"
that you can't be served?/

01:52:44.823 --> 01:52:46.522
You're not a suicide
bomber just 'cause

01:52:46.524 --> 01:52:49.528
you got the eyebrows of
an Angry Bird! /

01:52:52.063 --> 01:52:53.431
I'll go grab Che and let him

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:55.132
bust at you till
the chopper jams /

01:52:55.134 --> 01:52:59.072
We'll do a drive-by on your
falafel stand from his taco van/

01:53:00.872 --> 01:53:03.205
You're dating a porn star...

01:53:03.207 --> 01:53:05.241
we all know what her
vagina's touched/

01:53:05.243 --> 01:53:07.677
Most terrorists
get 72 virgins...

01:53:07.679 --> 01:53:11.448
you got a bitch who's fucked
72 guys at once! /

01:53:13.618 --> 01:53:14.985
You think this shit's real?

01:53:14.987 --> 01:53:16.419
You call me a faggot

01:53:16.421 --> 01:53:19.155
and half of these guys
collapse from laughter /

01:53:19.157 --> 01:53:21.592
Battle rap is so fucking corny

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:23.429
I'M a battle rapper!

01:53:25.764 --> 01:53:28.832
Here's an example...
you caught Che with your girl

01:53:28.834 --> 01:53:30.101
and didn't throw a
fist at the dude /

01:53:30.103 --> 01:53:31.502
But you punched someone
for getting in your face,

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.603
but if someone's getting in
your bitch then it's cool? /

01:53:33.605 --> 01:53:35.204
These battlers are all soft,

01:53:35.206 --> 01:53:36.973
they just pull the tough
guy shit for the views /

01:53:36.975 --> 01:53:38.942
Well I'm all up in your

01:53:43.782 --> 01:53:45.385
What you goin' do?

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:53.225
What the fuck, fam?

01:53:53.791 --> 01:53:55.292
That little love tap?

01:53:55.294 --> 01:53:56.893
That was real touching /

01:53:56.895 --> 01:53:58.262
But I just murdered
my own friend

01:53:58.264 --> 01:54:01.367
so you should know that
I DON'T FEEL NOTHING! /

01:54:03.434 --> 01:54:05.468
You tap chins when
you know you can't win,

01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:07.503

leave me on the ground? /

01:54:07.505 --> 01:54:10.207

...THIS is the one you

01:55:35.227 --> 01:55:37.093
If I came back from the

01:55:37.095 --> 01:55:38.261
this shit happened,

01:55:38.263 --> 01:55:39.929
I'd tell myself to get

01:55:39.931 --> 01:55:43.334
A battler so new he doesn't
even have a fuckin' rap name

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:45.735

juggernaut of the scene.

01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:15.665
Hi kids!

01:56:15.667 --> 01:56:16.667

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:20.035

01:56:20.037 --> 01:56:21.170

I'm tryin' to get my
head straight

01:56:28.279 --> 01:56:30.146
But I can't figure
out which Spice Girl

01:56:30.148 --> 01:56:31.481
I want to impregnate

01:56:31.483 --> 01:56:32.515
(oh)

01:56:32.517 --> 01:56:34.017
And Dr.Dre said,
"Slim Shady you a base-head"

01:56:34.019 --> 01:56:35.151
Uh-uh!

01:56:35.153 --> 01:56:37.154
"So why's your face
red? Man you wasted"

01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:38.254
Well since age twelve,

01:56:38.256 --> 01:56:39.722
I've felt like I'm someone else

01:56:39.724 --> 01:56:42.526
'Cause I hung my original self
from the top bunk with a belt

01:56:42.528 --> 01:56:45.261
Got pissed off and
ripped Pamela Lee's tits off

01:56:45.263 --> 01:56:46.530
And smacked her so hard

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:48.265
I knocked her clothes
backwards like Kris Kross

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:50.868
I smoke a fat pound of grass
and fall on my ass

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:53.535
Faster than a fat bitch who
sat down too fast

01:56:53.537 --> 01:56:56.707
C'mere slut (Shady, wait a
minute, that's my girl dog)

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:59.610
I don't give a fuck, God sent
me to piss the world off

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:00.142
Hi!

01:57:00.144 --> 01:57:01.244
My name is (what?)

01:57:01.246 --> 01:57:02.713
My name is (who?)

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:04.948

My name is (what?)

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:10.654
My name is Slim Shady

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:11.186
Hi!

01:57:11.188 --> 01:57:12.321
My name is (what?)

01:57:12.323 --> 01:57:13.856
My name is (who?)

01:57:13.858 --> 01:57:16.160
My name is Slim Shady

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:16.860
Hi!

01:57:16.862 --> 01:57:18.061

My name is (what?)

01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:21.664
My name is Slim Shady

01:57:21.666 --> 01:57:24.200
My English teacher wanted
to have flunk me in Junior High

01:57:24.202 --> 01:57:27.204
Thanks a lot next semester
I'll be thirty-five

01:57:27.206 --> 01:57:29.472
I smacked him
in his face with an eraser

01:57:29.474 --> 01:57:30.740
Chased him with a stapler

01:57:30.742 --> 01:57:33.476
And stapled his nuts to a
stack of papers (ow)

01:57:33.478 --> 01:57:34.710
Walked in the strip club,

01:57:34.712 --> 01:57:37.013
had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender,

01:57:37.015 --> 01:57:40.183
then stuck my dick in the
tip cup Extraterrestrial,

01:57:40.185 --> 01:57:42.052
running over pedestrians
In a space ship

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:44.753
while they screamin' at me
"Let's just be friends"

01:57:44.755 --> 01:57:46.755
Ninety-nine percent of my
life I was lied to

01:57:46.757 --> 01:57:49.860
I just found out my mom
does more dope than I do

01:57:49.862 --> 01:57:50.860
(damn)

01:57:50.862 --> 01:57:52.428
I told her I'd grow up
to be a famous rapper

01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:55.298
Make a record about doin'
drugs and name it after her

01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.633
(oh thank you)

01:57:56.635 --> 01:57:58.168
You know you blew up when
the women rush your stands

01:57:58.170 --> 01:57:59.302
And try to touch your hands

01:57:59.304 --> 01:58:01.237
like some screamin'
Usher fans (ah)

01:58:01.239 --> 01:58:02.972
This guy at White Castle
asked for my autograph

01:58:02.974 --> 01:58:03.839
(Dude, can I get
your autograph?)

01:58:03.841 --> 01:58:04.841
So I signed it,

01:58:04.843 --> 01:58:06.810
"Dear Dave, thanks for
the support, asshole!"

01:58:06.812 --> 01:58:07.343
Hi!

01:58:07.345 --> 01:58:08.411
My name is (what?)

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:12.915

01:58:17.889 --> 01:58:18.387

My name is Slim Shady

01:58:28.867 --> 01:58:32.235
Stop the tape, this kid needs
to be locked away (get him)

01:58:32.237 --> 01:58:34.469
Dr. Dre, don't just
stand there, operate!

01:58:34.471 --> 01:58:35.672
I'm not ready to leave,

01:58:35.674 --> 01:58:37.508
it's too scary to die
(fuck that)

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:39.542
I'll have to be carried
inside the cemetery and

01:58:39.544 --> 01:58:40.977
buried alive (Huh yup!)

01:58:40.979 --> 01:58:43.111
Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide

01:58:43.113 --> 01:58:46.583
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
dare me to drive? (go ahead)

01:58:46.585 --> 01:58:48.584
All my life I was
very deprived

01:58:48.586 --> 01:58:49.718
I ain't had a woman in years,

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.753
and my palms are too
hairy to hide

01:58:51.755 --> 01:58:52.688
(Whoops!)

01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:54.024
Clothes ripped like the
Incredible Hulk

01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:55.325
I spit when I talk,

01:58:55.327 --> 01:58:57.160
I'll fuck anything that
walks (c'mere)

01:58:57.162 --> 01:58:59.795
When I was little I used to
get so hungry I would throw fits

01:58:59.797 --> 01:59:01.630
How you gonna breast
feed me Mom? (wah)

01:59:01.632 --> 01:59:02.865
You ain't got no tits
(wah)

01:59:02.867 --> 01:59:05.500
I lay awake and
strap myself in the bed

01:59:05.502 --> 01:59:06.837
Put a bulletproof vest on

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:08.303
and shoot myself in the head
(bang)

01:59:08.305 --> 01:59:09.606
I'm steamin' mad (argh)

01:59:09.608 --> 01:59:11.741
And by the way
when you see my dad? (yeah)

01:59:11.743 --> 01:59:13.043
Tell him that
I slit his throat,

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:14.110

01:59:14.112 --> 01:59:14.843
