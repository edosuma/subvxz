WEBVTT

00:20.324 --> 00:21.717
Hey.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.719
Oh, damn. You scared me.

00:23.762 --> 00:24.894
Thought you might
be the girls.

00:24.937 --> 00:25.808
They're not here yet?No.

00:25.851 --> 00:26.765
No, but they will be.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.071
Man, I knew
they'd blow us off.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.551
Nobody's blowing us off.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.292
If the girls said they're
coming, they're coming.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.597
Don't worry.You're sure no one's home?

00:32.641 --> 00:33.859
Yeah.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.426
Yeah, I've been
scouting this yard for days.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.907
All right,
the guy must be out of town.I hope so.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.561
Uh, how hot's his tub?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.737
Uh, he keeps it at 102.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.086
Think maybe that's too hot?

00:43.130 --> 00:44.435
:
Not for me.

00:44.479 --> 00:47.264
Hell with it. Right?

00:47.308 --> 00:49.353
Yeah.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.315
Ready?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.332
♪

01:42.580 --> 01:44.626
Think I got everything
you asked for.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.758
Your notebooks, spare keys,

01:46.802 --> 01:48.412
and a PalmPilot?

01:48.456 --> 01:50.153
That's a little embarrassing.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.721
There are a few old numbers
that I have yet to transfer.

01:52.764 --> 01:53.983
Thank you, Jack.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.289
Uh-huh.

01:55.332 --> 01:56.725
You don't want to stick around?

01:56.768 --> 01:59.249
No. I'm gonna spend every second
of my admin leave

01:59.293 --> 02:01.643
with my kids.Amen to that.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.688
How you holding up?
I'm okay.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.864
Considering. How about you?

02:05.908 --> 02:07.562
Best I've been in months, so...

02:07.605 --> 02:09.738
And amen to that.
Mm.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.043
BISHOP:
Morning.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.524
What up, my dude?Hey, morning.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.352
Sure you don't want
to just say hello?

02:15.396 --> 02:18.094
No, not today.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.748
I, um...

02:19.791 --> 02:21.663
TORRES:
Oh, come on, no.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.360
Oh, man.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.884
Although things do seem
to be back to normal.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.365
I stepped
on my favorite shades.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.367
Are you serious

02:30.411 --> 02:31.847
Normal. Right.
Right.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.371
Keep holding down the fort,
Jack, thank you.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.767
Oh, man.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.425
How could I be so stupid?

02:44.468 --> 02:45.904
You're not stupid.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.429
Accidents happen.
They're just sunglasses.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.082
They're not just sunglasses.

02:50.126 --> 02:53.564
Well, I'm sure you can fix 'em.
Or, you know, buy another pair.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.436
There is no other pair, McGee.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.182
They're just so cool,
you know? They...

03:02.225 --> 03:05.402
they fit my perfectly
symmetrical face so right.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.143
Okay, then.GIBBS: Okay, nothing.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.666
Got a dead body in Springfield.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.754
Stupid boots.

03:09.798 --> 03:10.755
You gonna be okay?

03:10.799 --> 03:11.843
Perfect.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.761
You heard him.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.633
He's perfect.
Perfect.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.812
Got it.
Uh, sure, thank you.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.727
Thank you.
Couple of teens

03:25.770 --> 03:27.032
from the next cul-de-sac over

03:27.076 --> 03:28.686
found the body
just after midnight.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.601
No ID yet,
but the house is being rented

03:30.645 --> 03:32.777
to a Navy Lieutenant
Davis Mooney.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.389
And, um, apparently
it's pretty ugly in there.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.564
Like we haven't seen ugly.

03:39.131 --> 03:42.657
No, ugly never smelled
like that. Mm-mm.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.142
Hey, didn't we have
another hot tub call

03:50.186 --> 03:52.014
about ten years ago? Gah.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.972
Mm-mm. Forget that gurney.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.800
I am gonna need buckets.GIBBS:
Torres,

03:55.844 --> 03:58.673
check the house. Bishop,
McGee, see who knows what.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.718
Ugh, okay.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.940
LONI:
That poor, sweet man.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.985
He only moved in a
month or two ago.

04:07.029 --> 04:08.248
So you didn't
know him well?

04:08.291 --> 04:09.727
:
Well...

04:09.771 --> 04:11.381
not for lack of trying.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.557
As a fellow divorcée, you know,

04:13.601 --> 04:15.385
I tried to make
him feel welcome.

04:15.429 --> 04:19.171
But he kept to himself
mostly... sadly.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.782
GARY:
I've lived here a long time.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.392
Never seen
anything like it.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.916
First the burglary at the
Reynolds' place, and now this?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.918
What's the neighborhood
coming to?

04:26.962 --> 04:30.095
Down the toilet, I'd say.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.707
At least put some pants on,
Edgar.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.187
BISHOP:
Okay, so it was your house

04:35.231 --> 04:37.277
that was burglarized
two weeks ago?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.453
Yeah. It was Gary
who called the police.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.932
We weren't even home
at the time.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.021
Mm.
No, but just think
if we had been.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.849
'Cause that could've
been us.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.634
I wish we could be
more help, but, um...

04:46.677 --> 04:48.636
we got a game.Well, appreciate your time.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.987
If you can think of anything
else, give us a call.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.771
Appreciate your time.

04:53.815 --> 04:54.946
Thank you.Don't mention it.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.121
If you can think
of anything else...

04:56.165 --> 04:57.340
Thank you.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.211
Thank you.
...give us a call.

04:59.255 --> 05:02.084
JIMMY:
Agent Gibbs, I'm gonna need
some help back here.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.043
TORRES:
Why are you giving me gloves?

05:05.087 --> 05:06.523
What? Are you out
of your damn mind?

05:06.567 --> 05:08.699
This is too disgusting
to be doing in broad daylight.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.919
I'm not even sure it's
gonna work, anyway.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.573
Palmer, how long
has he been in there?

05:12.616 --> 05:13.878
Hard to say, Agent Gibbs.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.358
I mean, a submerged body
is one thing,

05:15.402 --> 05:17.708
but, uh, the-the timer
came on each night

05:17.752 --> 05:19.536
and turned on the Jacuzzi
and the heater,

05:19.580 --> 05:21.277
which only accelerated
the decomp.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.713
Yeah, that's what
it smells like.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.237
JIMMY:
Check this out.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.327
This is a Navy ring.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.241
Has the initials D.M.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.243
As in Davis Mooney.Well, that's a tentative ID

05:31.287 --> 05:32.941
until I get him back to autopsy.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.769
I wonder what else
is down there.There's a lot of chunks

05:34.812 --> 05:36.858
floating around down there,
I can tell you that.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.990
Did you haveto tell me that?Yeah, that's way more
than I needed.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.644
Yeah, me, too.Me, three.

05:40.688 --> 05:41.732
GIBBS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:41.776 --> 05:42.907
Where's everybody going?

05:42.951 --> 05:44.344
Well, it was definitely
a robbery,

05:44.387 --> 05:46.258
so, uh, I was gonna keep
searching the house.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.652
Uh, and I was gonna go help him.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.654
And I was gonna go
maybe throw up a little bit.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.396
Torres, go finish up inside.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.356
McGee, you got to throw up,
go throw up.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.140
Bishop,
call the evidence garage.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.272
Get a flatbed down here.Flatbed truck?

06:00.316 --> 06:02.579
A flatbed truck with a crane.For one body?

06:02.623 --> 06:05.365
And the tub.
We're taking the tub back.BISHOP: I'm sorry.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.627
The whole tub?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.280
Do you know
what that must weigh?

06:08.324 --> 06:09.412
Uh, tub's, what, 500 pounds?

06:09.456 --> 06:11.240
Water's eight pounds a gallon.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.720
Yeah, it's a lot of water.It's a lot of evidence.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.418
Boss...McGee...

06:15.462 --> 06:18.073
would you rather dig
through the chum with Palmer?

06:38.659 --> 06:41.444
Hey, uh, Nick, do
you know if we...?Don't touch me.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.881
I'm not touching, I'm talking.Don't talk.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.143
Don't even breathe.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.450
I think this might
actually work.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.104
Give me an update.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.366
Can I breathe now?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.455
Superglue, my ass.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.935
Please don't.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.632
McGEE: ID is still
preliminary,

06:55.676 --> 06:57.373
but we believe the victim

06:57.417 --> 06:58.635
is Lieutenant Davis Mooney.

06:58.679 --> 07:01.159
35 years old. Recently
divorced. No kids.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.596
Active duty since '09

07:02.639 --> 07:04.380
and now a public affairs officer
and part-time writer

07:04.424 --> 07:06.164
for the Navy Herald. Motive?

07:06.208 --> 07:07.775
Robbery gone wrong.
His place was tossed.

07:07.818 --> 07:11.039
The power cords left behind
indicate that...

07:15.391 --> 07:17.349
Indicate what, Torres?

07:18.873 --> 07:21.136
That Mooney's,
uh, laptop was taken.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.833
As well as
a home surveillance DVR.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.487
Same with the previous break-in
at the Reynolds'.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.010
Their nanny cam was stolen,
as well.Yeah.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.360
Whoever robbed these
houses, definitely a pro.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.232
And now a murderer.Find the ex-wife.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.363
Talk to the Navy Herald.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.844
Glue boy, try turpentine.

07:33.888 --> 07:37.152
Oh, great. Who's got turpentine?

07:37.195 --> 07:38.501
I've got nail polish remover.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.633
Ooh, I do, too.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.025
Would that work?

07:44.899 --> 07:46.683
This has got to be a first.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.859
Perhaps for you, dear Kasie,

07:48.903 --> 07:52.733
but it is our second
hot tub-related death

07:52.776 --> 07:54.038
in recent memory.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.692
Uh, trust me, Doctor.

07:55.736 --> 07:58.434
This one?
Nothing like the first.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.698
Ooh, okay. I have to admit
to some morbid curiosity.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.047
I mean, word gets around

08:03.091 --> 08:05.310
about the most disgusting
body find

08:05.354 --> 08:08.139
in NCIS history,
a girl's got to see it.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.750
I should really refer you

08:09.793 --> 08:12.840
to the most notorious
of our cases,

08:12.883 --> 08:14.450
The Meat Puzzle.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.409
Yes, I found it
truly fascinating.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.891
:
Others, utterly revolting.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.719
Yeah, and with a name
like Meat Puzzle,

08:22.763 --> 08:24.765
I don't even want to a...

08:27.768 --> 08:29.291
My God.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.075
It's a slow cooker.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.687
I think we did a great job
getting it here so neatly.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.776
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.429
This is worse than
The Meat Puzzle.

08:37.473 --> 08:41.695
What it is, is one big,
disgusting crime scene.

08:41.738 --> 08:45.437
Huh? I mean, look at this.
There's clues inside and out.

08:45.481 --> 08:49.180
Might I suggest, Doctor, that
we start by removing the body?

08:49.224 --> 08:52.575
Hmm, and then drain and strain
the water for the smaller bits?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.403
Oh, yeah, then we can
take the tub apart

08:54.446 --> 08:56.536
and check the filter.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.712
You know, it might be easier

08:58.755 --> 09:02.367
if we harvest the larger pieces
by hand.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.673
You know what? I'm, um...

09:03.717 --> 09:05.936
I'm gonna go dig up
those strainers.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.286
And maybe a gas mask.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.940
You really had to say "harvest"?

09:11.333 --> 09:13.944
Yeah.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.601
Hey. So, the editor
at the Navy Herald

09:18.645 --> 09:20.429
was lovely but not much help.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.562
Mooney was a good guy
and a great writer,

09:22.605 --> 09:24.128
but she hadn't seen him

09:24.172 --> 09:26.304
since he took leave last month
to focus on his book.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.219
What book?Again, no details.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.569
McGEE: And there's no
files for us to check?

09:29.612 --> 09:31.092
BISHOP: No, not
at their office.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.094
Apparently, he worked strictly
from his laptop.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.486
The laptop we don't have.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.618
But the killer now does.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.316
Special Agent McGee.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.623
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much.

09:40.667 --> 09:44.235
I've tracked down Mooney's
ex-wife through her church.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.150
They said she was
in Puerto Rico.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.500
And who said
that tape would work?They're sunglasses.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.981
Why are you still
beating yourself up?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.635
Do you have anyone else
I could beat up?

09:52.679 --> 09:54.419
Okay.

09:54.463 --> 09:57.118
So, Mooney's ex-wife.
Puerto Rico?

09:57.161 --> 09:58.989
She's on a relief mission,
but she's in an area

09:59.033 --> 10:00.600
that still has no electricity.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.080
But the church is gonna get
the message to her now.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.169
Well, that was interesting.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.172
So, one
of the neighbors, Loni,

10:08.216 --> 10:09.347
suddenly has a theory
about the murder.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.132
I had a feeling
about those neighbors.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.264
Well, so does Loni,
apparently. She insisted

10:13.308 --> 10:15.005
I not let the others know
she called.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.181
"Don't tell
the other neighbors."

10:17.225 --> 10:18.313
That's what she said.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.662
What? Uh, no.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.316
That's what Kenna Reynolds
just texted me.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.752
The soccer mom.
She wants to talk.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.493
Oh, this is getting good.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.843
Two new witnesses,
just like that.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.194
Make that three?

10:30.238 --> 10:32.544
I didn't give out
any of my cards.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.591
Oh, I did. Sorry.
Ran out of mine.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.855
Special Agent Torres.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.954
Well, so much for us
not telling the neighbors.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.391
All right, how are we gonna
do this thing again?

10:53.435 --> 10:55.480
Well, I guess let's
divide and conquer

10:55.524 --> 10:58.048
and compare
notes after.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.615
Ooh.
Oh, yeah.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.051
Huh.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.879
Now it's a block party.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.577
Which one called
you, Gibbs?

11:05.621 --> 11:07.797
Not one. Three.
McGEE:
Suddenly,

11:07.841 --> 11:09.930
the whole neighborhood's
got a story to tell.A dynamic

11:09.973 --> 11:11.453
I just couldn't resist.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.324
And what
dynamic is that?Cul-de-sacs

11:13.368 --> 11:15.500
are a psychological gold mine--

11:15.544 --> 11:17.894
test labs for tribal behaviors,

11:17.938 --> 11:21.245
complete with alliances,
betrayals, intrigue.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.073
Sounds more like one
of those survival shows.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.946
Uh...  guys.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.263
TORRES:
I think this show

11:39.307 --> 11:41.309
already
started.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.791
Nothing creepy about this
at all.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.193
LONI:
Are you the jealous type,
Agent McGee?

11:56.237 --> 11:58.195
Uh... no. Uh,
why don't we...?

11:58.239 --> 11:59.544
Because I might know
who is.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.808
Those soccer parents
across the way?

12:01.851 --> 12:04.114
:
Shh. Don't look.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.422
Just between us,

12:07.465 --> 12:11.165
I saw Kenna making eyes at the
new neighbor a few weeks back,

12:11.208 --> 12:15.256
and it seems to me,
if Dan is the jealous type...

12:17.824 --> 12:20.435
Are you suggesting that Dan
killed Lieutenant Mooney?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.002
:
No. No.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.699
I'm not suggesting anything.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.309
That's...

12:25.353 --> 12:27.921
It's just that people are
complicated, you know?

12:27.964 --> 12:30.401
Well, just pick anybody
on the block.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.927
That nosy neighbor Gary--
he never liked Mooney, either.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.885
Why is that?Now, don't...

12:35.929 --> 12:37.191
:
Don't look.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.845
I don't know exactly.

12:38.888 --> 12:43.066
Something in his quiet demeanor
that just made Gary crazy.

12:43.110 --> 12:47.157
Much the way that your...
brooding masculinity

12:47.201 --> 12:50.552
is making me a little short
of breath and light-headed.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.207
Loni, do you have
any actual information?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.948
Is that a wedding band?

12:54.991 --> 12:57.298
GARY:
Poor, lonely Loni.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.866
I just knew she had a thing
for that Navy man.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.171
How much
of a thing?

13:01.215 --> 13:03.130
Nothing too Fatal Attraction.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.654
But as another
strong, silent type,

13:05.697 --> 13:07.830
you might want
to steer clear of her.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.702
And you said
you witnessed the murder?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.313
Not exactly.

13:12.356 --> 13:15.055
But I did witness the Reynolds'
burglary two weeks ago,

13:15.098 --> 13:17.057
and it's got to be
the same guy, right?

13:17.100 --> 13:19.711
Dan and Kenna were out
with the kids

13:19.755 --> 13:22.323
at some game or practice
or whatever they do,

13:22.366 --> 13:24.020
while Darrin Stephens and I

13:24.064 --> 13:27.502
were making our usual
Neighborhood Watch rounds,

13:27.545 --> 13:30.200
when all of a sudden,
we saw a flashlight beam

13:30.244 --> 13:33.203
bouncing around
inside their windows.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.770
Darrin Stephens?
Wasn't that the name

13:34.814 --> 13:36.163
of the husband on Bewitched?

13:36.206 --> 13:38.426
The first Darrin, yes.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.732
Not that goofy second one.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.735
Anyway, just as I was
calling 911,

13:43.779 --> 13:46.390
this man suddenly ran
out their side door,

13:46.434 --> 13:49.741
hopped their backyard fence,
and disappeared into the night.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.353
Did you or Darrin Stephens get
a good look at this guy or not?

13:52.396 --> 13:54.877
Not his face, but his form.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.271
Tall, trim, athletic.

13:57.314 --> 14:01.188
Can't say who it was exactly,
but I have some ideas.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.842
How much time do you both have?

14:05.409 --> 14:06.846
I couldn't say this earlier,

14:06.889 --> 14:09.500
but you should know
that our neighbors are...

14:09.544 --> 14:11.938
oh, shall we say
a tad colorful?

14:11.981 --> 14:14.331
Yeah, that's one way
of putting it.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.203
How colorful are we talking?

14:16.246 --> 14:20.207
Look, um, we're grateful
that Gary was, you know,

14:20.250 --> 14:22.426
watching our house,
but it's like

14:22.470 --> 14:24.037
no one can make
a move around here

14:24.080 --> 14:25.777
without someone commenting.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.258
More of a balance
would be nice, you know,

14:28.302 --> 14:31.044
between friendliness and
folks minding their business.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.872
So, do you guys have
any new information?

14:32.915 --> 14:34.917
Well...

14:34.961 --> 14:39.574
it's not new, and I hate
to say it, but Edgar--

14:39.617 --> 14:42.707
bathrobe guy--
you know, as you may

14:42.751 --> 14:44.579
have guessed--
he's not a good neighbor.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.928
Doesn't make him a killer, babe.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.277
No. Did I say that he was?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.018
No, you didn't say it.TORRES:
You said

14:49.062 --> 14:50.454
you had new
information, Edgar.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.934
That don't sound
like new information.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.414
You want new, agent?

14:53.457 --> 14:55.198
I think Mooney was up
to something.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.634
Really

14:56.678 --> 14:58.941
The way he'd always
be looking around

14:58.985 --> 15:01.204
and real sneaky-like.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.033
Like when he'd take out
his garbage or mow his lawn.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.470
Oh, is that two activities
you have no concept of?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.472
Why you got
to be so rude?

15:08.516 --> 15:10.431
Rude

15:10.474 --> 15:12.215
Your car, your garage,

15:12.259 --> 15:14.304
this lawn.
That's rude.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.960
Your neighbors keep their lawns
nice and clean. So should you.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.744
Torres?

15:19.788 --> 15:22.051
The social contract--
they clean, you clean.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.532
Torres, now.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.753
Put some clothes on.

15:28.797 --> 15:31.713
Nobody want to see that.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.761
SLOANE:
Seems all they want

15:36.805 --> 15:38.763
to do is point fingers.BISHOP:
Yeah, Kenna Reynolds

15:38.807 --> 15:41.331
wasn't kidding. That is
one wacky cul-de-sac.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.768
Oh, wacky
or increasingly common?

15:43.812 --> 15:45.857
I wouldn't go that far, but...

15:45.901 --> 15:48.512
Uh, should I get it?
Where is Nick?

15:48.556 --> 15:49.949
He's in the doghouse with Ducky.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.689
So, anyway,

15:51.733 --> 15:53.909
neighbors acting
less than neighborly end up

15:53.953 --> 15:56.172
with no shortage of false
assumptions about each another.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.434
Uh, it's Mooney's ex-wife.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.175
Flying back from Puerto Rico,
changing planes

15:59.219 --> 16:01.351
in Miami now.I can patch her through to MTAC.

16:01.395 --> 16:02.700
Okay. Let's go.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.528
Got you.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.226
We found a tattoo on his arm

16:06.269 --> 16:08.010
that helped confirm
the lieutenant's ID.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.881
And based on the size
of these fly larvae,

16:09.925 --> 16:12.362
I'd put time of death
at about two weeks.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.017
With this level
of decomposition,

16:15.061 --> 16:18.412
the cause of death will be
difficult to determine.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.370
Right. Of course.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.198
Are you all right, Nick?

16:22.242 --> 16:25.549
After seeing that,
not especially.
Here.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.030
Take a seat. Sit down.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.076
You, uh, walk around with that
thing in your pocket all day?

16:30.119 --> 16:33.905
Since my myocardial infarction,
absolutely.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.213
Look, I know Gibbs thinks that
there's something up with me,

16:37.257 --> 16:39.433
but I'm fine, really.
Mm-hmm.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.219
What?You do look a tad pallid.

16:43.263 --> 16:46.353
Oh, be quiet, Palmer.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.356
What's "pallid"?Pallid-- pale,
devoid of sparkle.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.053
But I think
you're plenty sparkly.

16:51.097 --> 16:54.491
Yes, well, this isn't
sparkly, Kasie.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.190
This is 140/90.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.105
Is that, uh, high
or something?

16:59.148 --> 17:01.455
For a man
in your physical condition, yes.

17:01.498 --> 17:05.850
What I prescribe for you,
young man, is a rest.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.722
Ducky, rest?
Oh, no, man.
Mm-hmm.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.680
I was thinking more
like a night out.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.508
You know, blow
off some steam,

17:11.552 --> 17:12.901
get a couple of beers.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.599
I don't know about that.I do.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.688
You do what

17:17.732 --> 17:19.386
I wa... I was just
telling you that

17:19.429 --> 17:21.127
while Breena and
Victoria are out of town,

17:21.170 --> 17:23.303
I could really
use a night out.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.652
You know?

17:24.695 --> 17:26.045
Cut loose.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.178
Oh, yes. Loose.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.267
Indeed.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.356
Now, Nick, I don't
know about beer,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.054
but how do you
feel about wine?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.099
KASIE:
Holy cause of death,

17:37.143 --> 17:39.971
Batman!

17:40.015 --> 17:42.757
Could this be our culprit?

17:45.151 --> 17:46.935
[woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.]

17:46.978 --> 17:51.113
I'd been planning to fly home
to see Davis next week.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.985
We only split up six months ago.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.422
I missed him.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.119
What broke you up,
Mrs. Mooney?

17:57.163 --> 17:59.426
Typical stuff.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.428
No communication.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.256
Mostly when it came to his book.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.648
It's all he could think of,

18:04.692 --> 18:06.607
but God forbid
he'd discuss it with me.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.697
For my own protection, he'd say.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.177
What was his book about?

18:11.220 --> 18:13.918
It's all in there
in-in his laptop.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.010
Didn't you find it?

18:19.054 --> 18:21.187
No, it was taken
during the robbery.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.840
Oh, no.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.320
I warned him.

18:24.364 --> 18:25.669
You warned him?

18:27.758 --> 18:30.152
I don't think
that was a robbery.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.502
He must have been getting
too close.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.722
Too close to what?

18:34.765 --> 18:38.856
My husband was writing about
this string of unsolved murders

18:38.900 --> 18:41.468
by a killer they called
The Dentist.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.166
I remember that case.
It was from several years back.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.386
But it was like yesterday
to Davis.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.953
His own cousin was one
of the victims.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.347
WOMAN :
...Flight 721
to Dulles International Airport.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.827
And that's my connecting flight.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.350
I got to go.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.786
Oh, you go ahead.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.354
We'll check in with you
again tomorrow.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.443
The Dentist?

19:00.487 --> 19:02.532
McGEE:
He claimed nine victims

19:02.576 --> 19:04.534
throughout the Northeast
over a six-year span.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.319
Last murder was
seven years ago.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.321
And I didn't realize
they never caught the guy.

19:08.364 --> 19:11.628
Lieutenant Mooney's cousin
Pamela was victim number five.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.804
She was found stabbed
to death in a quarry

19:13.848 --> 19:16.285
in Erie,
Pennsylvania, 2009.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.200
Which would make his
book very personal.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.593
TORRES:
They found a possible
murder weapon--

19:19.636 --> 19:21.203
a tip of a box cutter.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.118
Kasie's processing it now.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.815
Dentist use a box cutter?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.208
His M.O. ran the gamut.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.688
Stabbing, shooting,
strangulation.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.342
Did you say "Dentist"?
Yup.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.475
Named by authorities due
to his signature move--

19:32.519 --> 19:35.478
taking a tooth from each
of his victims as a trophy.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.219
Yeah, I'll catch
you up, Nick.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.786
By tomorrow morning,
we're allgonna catch up.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.875
Every clue, every suspect,
every detail.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.485
You ready to tear up the town,
Nick?

19:42.529 --> 19:44.966
Cannot wait.Hold on. What are you
two gonna tear up?

19:45.009 --> 19:46.576
Agent Torres and I are just
headed out

19:46.620 --> 19:48.230
to blow off a little steam,
you know?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.579
Just us dudes.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.712
Ducky's orders, Gibbs.
It's all good.

19:51.755 --> 19:52.800
Yeah.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.326
I mean, how much trouble
could they get into, right?

20:06.944 --> 20:09.208
So, uh, Jimmy,

20:09.251 --> 20:10.948
this is you, huh?

20:10.992 --> 20:13.516
This is, uh,
you tearing up the town?

20:13.560 --> 20:16.998
Look, man, I call
this relaxing,

20:17.041 --> 20:19.653
therapeutic, creative.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.698
And you have to admit,

20:21.742 --> 20:23.222
the wine is pretty good.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.573
Wow.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.879
God, this is what marriage does
to you.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.272
Yeah. Isn't it great?

20:30.316 --> 20:31.969
Yup. But look at your apple.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.798
I mean, that thing-- that looks
good enough to eat, man.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.323
TORRES:
Uh, Myrna, I need

20:37.366 --> 20:39.238
a refill.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.631
This ain't no saloon, pal.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.720
Yeah, you can
say that again.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.156
Ain't no cantina, either.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.292
Great texture-building
on both paintings, gentlemen.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.076
Very nice.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.644
Ah, shucks, Myrna. It's the
wine doing all the painting.

20:54.688 --> 20:58.257
I am merely along
for the ride.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.912
Oh, brother.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.827
Well, you two
are natural artists.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.655
Nothing natural
about 'em.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.007
Hey, yo.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.313
I like to laugh.

21:12.706 --> 21:13.968
What's so funny over there?

21:14.011 --> 21:17.188
We ain't talking
to you... amigo.

21:17.232 --> 21:20.017
Oh, now it's,
uh, "amigo"?

21:20.061 --> 21:22.019
Hey, it means
"friend," don't it?

21:22.063 --> 21:23.673
Not the way you say it.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.850
Nick, just... let it go.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.026
Yeah, Nick,
let it go.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.985
Listen to your
boyfriend, Nick.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.378
You might
live longer.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.510
Boyfriend?

21:34.554 --> 21:36.338
Look, it's...
We-we get it.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.861
It's funny.

21:37.905 --> 21:40.342
They think that we're a
couple, and it's-it's...

21:40.386 --> 21:41.822
You don't want to
know what I think.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.738
Okay, for your
information...

21:44.781 --> 21:46.653
Jimmy.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.527
So, um,

21:51.571 --> 21:54.225
what if we are a couple?

21:57.141 --> 21:59.230
What business
is it to you?

21:59.274 --> 22:00.710
JIMMY:
Yeah, that's right.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.538
What's it to you?

22:02.582 --> 22:03.887
Gentlemen, please.

22:03.931 --> 22:07.413
No, Myrna, no worries.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.718
'Cause we're gonna
take this outside.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.067
Outside where you can run?

22:10.111 --> 22:13.070
DAVID:
Or you girls could
just run along.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.899
The only place
we're running to...Is right over you.

22:15.943 --> 22:18.641
MYRNA:
Gentlemen,
let's all stay calm now.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.382
All right!

22:20.426 --> 22:21.775
Throw me that.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.387
MYRNA:
Enough!

22:25.431 --> 22:27.781
I'm gonna rip
your head off.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.843
:
Butterfly, bee.

22:48.671 --> 22:53.284
Assault, destruction
of property.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.287
What are you gonna tell Breena?

22:56.331 --> 22:58.246
Tell her we had
no choice.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.205
No, we had a choice.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.556
:
That was dumb.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.082
Or maybe this is just
what we needed.

23:14.567 --> 23:15.785
Oh, Agent Gibbs.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.657
Hey, thanks for coming
to get us.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.093
Did we get you up?

23:19.136 --> 23:20.660
TORRES:
It's 3:00 a.m.
in the morning.

23:20.703 --> 23:21.791
Of course we did.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.708
Gosh, I-I'm sorry about that,

23:25.752 --> 23:27.580
but, uh, you'd have done
the same thing.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.233
These guys...Go home, Palmer.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.410
Get some sleep.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.716
Sleep? Right.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.501
Like that's possible.

23:37.285 --> 23:40.114
Hey, um, don't be mad at Jimmy.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.637
Get your act together.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.465
Okay.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.467
I screwed up.No, not okay.

23:45.511 --> 23:49.428
Guys with your skill set
can't get in bar fights.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.125
It was not a bar.Stop.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.999
We'll talk in the morning.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.490
You got arrested
for fighting?

24:08.534 --> 24:09.796
At a painting workshop?

24:09.839 --> 24:11.319
What? Did it make
the morning news?

24:11.362 --> 24:13.495
No, no. Palmer got here early
to share the details.

24:13.539 --> 24:14.714
Look, he even
brought doughnuts.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.804
TORRES :
Oh, wow.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.502
I've created a monster.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.504
I don't know. Palmer said
the guys you fought

24:22.548 --> 24:24.114
were the real monsters.

24:24.158 --> 24:27.117
More like dinosaurs, but still.Nick.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.379
Seriously, you okay?

24:28.423 --> 24:29.816
I'm fine. This is nothing.

24:29.859 --> 24:33.515
Update.Look, uh, Gibbs, uh...

24:33.559 --> 24:37.519
No. Not now. Update.BISHOP: So, I, uh, researched
The Dentist's last victim.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.217
Murdered seven years ago
in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware,

24:40.261 --> 24:42.263
which led police to a suspect,

24:42.306 --> 24:45.005
Lewis Dacey, childhood friend
of the victim.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.398
Now, police worked to build
a case against him,

24:47.442 --> 24:49.139
but no charges
could ever be filed.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.401
Now, the name sounded
familiar to me,

24:50.445 --> 24:52.534
so I went through Mooney's
phone records again.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.884
Turns out just two weeks ago,
Mooney placed a call

24:54.928 --> 24:57.278
to an L. Dacey
in Towson, Maryland.

24:57.321 --> 25:00.934
Well, no such thing
as a coincidence.

25:00.977 --> 25:05.112
And what were you doing while
they were figuring all this out?

25:06.896 --> 25:11.510
Okay, I got it.
Get Dacey in here.

25:13.337 --> 25:16.515
Look, uh, Gibbs,
I sincerely apologize.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.692
So, uh, can we have
the talk now?

25:19.735 --> 25:22.433
No. We are not having a talk.We're not?

25:22.477 --> 25:24.435
SLOANE:
Uh, Agent Torres.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.263
Good morning.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.006
Come on up-- Ooh.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.095
Grab me a sprinkle doughnut
if you don't mind.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.623
Bye-bye.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.625
TORRES:
This is crazy.

25:39.668 --> 25:42.018
Sloane, I already said
I'm sorry.

25:43.019 --> 25:46.066
Come on, Nick.

25:46.109 --> 25:49.635
We all saw you last night
planning to tear up the town.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.724
Was it a fight
you were looking for?

25:51.767 --> 25:53.247
No, that fight found us.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.422
Of course.

25:54.465 --> 25:55.858
You found each other.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.599
And now you're
just apologizing

25:57.643 --> 25:59.383
because you don't want
to talk about it.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.647
Don't be passing judgment
over here.

26:01.690 --> 26:05.215
I recall a little bar fight that
you got into not too long ago.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.826
One, I'm not judging.

26:06.869 --> 26:10.003
Two, that was definitely
apples and oranges.

26:10.046 --> 26:13.441
And three, it kind of makes me
uniquely qualified

26:13.484 --> 26:14.747
to ask what's really
bugging you.

26:14.790 --> 26:15.922
Fine.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.754
You know what I'm really
sick and tired of?

26:21.797 --> 26:24.278
Hmm?
Why are people
so damn mean?

26:24.321 --> 26:26.585
Petty.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.891
From those neighbors
in their cul-de-sac

26:28.935 --> 26:30.458
to those clowns last night,

26:30.501 --> 26:34.723
everyone just seems to be...
angrier.

26:34.767 --> 26:38.814
And saying terrible things
that they've never said before.

26:38.858 --> 26:42.383
Fear and anxiety are
at an all-time high.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.690
Between politics
and social media...

26:44.733 --> 26:46.474
Why can't people just be nicer
to each other?

26:46.517 --> 26:47.823
Like you were last night.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.478
Oh, yeah, well,
not to those idiots.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.828
As much as we'd all like to,
we can't just go around

26:52.872 --> 26:54.656
punching people
into being nicer.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.875
Why not?

26:55.918 --> 26:57.659
I can be like the...

26:57.703 --> 27:00.488
the kindness bully.

27:00.531 --> 27:04.492
But first maybe try to be
a little kinder to yourself.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.973
Because, usually,

27:07.016 --> 27:10.541
underneath that sort
of anger and rage,

27:10.585 --> 27:14.023
is a lot of pain. I know.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.722
Whatever.

27:16.765 --> 27:17.984
Don't blow me off.I'm not blowing you off,

27:18.027 --> 27:20.682
but you're just getting
all touchy-feely.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.206
I know there's something
deeper going on.
No.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.556
There is not.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.210
I got into a fight,
that is it.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.996
Stop trying to make it
into something that it isn't.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.259
If you don't like it,
just send me home.

27:33.564 --> 27:37.220
Fine. Go home.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.441
You can't send me home.

27:40.484 --> 27:43.792
Oh, I believe I just did.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.887
Sloane cannot send me home.Oh, yeah.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.846
She can. So can I.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.717
Gibbs.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.023
You got arrested, Nick.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.502
It's not nothing.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.636
You don't want to
talk to Jack, fine.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.160
Go home.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.174
DACEY: I was hoping you had good news.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.611
Like you caught The Dentist?

28:20.655 --> 28:22.265
Well, maybe we have.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.314
And the nightmare
continues.

28:27.357 --> 28:30.360
This thing has ruined my life,
you know.

28:30.404 --> 28:33.624
Dental school dropout,

28:33.668 --> 28:36.149
childhood friend
of the last victim.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.455
That's all they had.

28:38.499 --> 28:41.763
But accused is as good
as convicted.

28:41.807 --> 28:45.549
Hard to scrub "suspected serial
killer" from my profile.

28:45.593 --> 28:48.422
This has cost me
girlfriends, bank loans,

28:48.465 --> 28:50.554
my job.

28:50.598 --> 28:51.860
Let's talk about this man.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.253
Mooney.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.645
What about him?BISHOP: He called you

28:54.689 --> 28:56.082
about two weeks ago?
Yeah.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.737
Never thought I'd be happy
to hear from that guy.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.434
You had several conversations

29:00.477 --> 29:02.305
with him over
the last year or so.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.264
Interviews for his book.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.483
But unlike this last call,
he wasn't buying my story

29:06.527 --> 29:08.268
back then.Your story?

29:08.311 --> 29:11.793
He always talked to me
like I was guilty.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.447
Like I was The Dentist.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.622
And this last call?

29:16.276 --> 29:18.017
I got an apology.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.196
Said he finally believed me.

29:25.633 --> 29:29.028
I can't tell you what a relief
it is to have just one person...

29:30.507 --> 29:32.901
I'm sorry.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.077
BISHOP:
Why now?

29:35.121 --> 29:37.253
I mean, what do you think
changed his mind?

29:37.297 --> 29:41.170
Mooney was sure he was
closing in on the real killer.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.651
He told me he moved to, uh,
some neighborhood recently

29:43.694 --> 29:45.087
where he thought
the real Dentist

29:45.131 --> 29:46.610
was living
a whole new life.

29:46.654 --> 29:47.916
Did he say who it was?

29:47.960 --> 29:49.352
He wouldn't.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.964
No, but-but he said
he was getting close.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.487
But why ask me?

29:53.530 --> 29:55.228
Wh-What does Mooney have
to say about this?

29:59.406 --> 30:03.018
Well, he's not
your man, Jethro.

30:03.062 --> 30:06.848
McGEE:
Either Dacey's one hell
of a liar...

30:06.892 --> 30:08.719
BISHOP:
He couldn't be.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.721
What are the chances
we all believed him?

30:10.765 --> 30:13.028
Especially amongst
this cast of oddballs.

30:13.072 --> 30:15.161
Not one of them looks
like a serial killer.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.076
What does a serial
killer look like?

30:18.512 --> 30:20.383
Excuse me, agents.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.473
I didn't know
where else to go.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.867
Uh, Mrs. Mooney, we
would have come to you.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.651
MRS. MOONEY:
This couldn't wait.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.697
When I got home, I started going
through old mail,

30:29.740 --> 30:31.742
and found this from Davis.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.657
Postmarked two weeks ago.

30:33.701 --> 30:38.053
He knew I'd been planning
to fly home, so...

30:38.097 --> 30:41.143
"Welcome home. Please hold
on to this for safekeeping.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.536
I'll explain when I see you."

30:42.579 --> 30:43.754
Hold on to what?

30:43.798 --> 30:44.886
What's in there?

30:44.930 --> 30:47.802
I was hoping you could tell me.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.978
Can't quite describe it myself.

30:55.810 --> 30:57.290
McGEE:
Okay.

30:57.333 --> 31:00.293
Small wooden box.Kind of pretty.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.253
Not so pretty.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.563
KASIE: Even before we get DNA results,

31:09.606 --> 31:12.783
I'm willing to bet almost
anything, these came

31:12.827 --> 31:15.047
from nine different people.And whoever The Dentist is,

31:15.090 --> 31:17.353
this box is like
his Holy Grail.

31:17.397 --> 31:18.833
What was Mooney doing
with it?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.096
What if he was
The Dentist all along,

31:21.140 --> 31:23.925
just writing the book to throw
everyone off his trail?

31:23.969 --> 31:26.058
Not bad, but why
would he write it now?

31:26.101 --> 31:28.321
Oh, yeah, true.
After all these years.

31:28.364 --> 31:31.585
My money is still
on Bathrobe Edgar.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.934
It's like he wants
to stand out,

31:32.978 --> 31:34.936
begging to-to be caught.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.286
Am I right?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.985
His last kill, how many years
ago was that?

31:40.028 --> 31:42.074
Seven.Okay, a serial killer--

31:42.117 --> 31:44.163
what would it take to make

31:44.206 --> 31:47.253
a serial killer stop cold
turkey, just like that?

31:47.296 --> 31:51.344
Most case studies point
to a change in lifestyle:

31:51.387 --> 31:53.085
death, illness, new environment.

31:53.128 --> 31:54.782
Marriage?Definitely marriage.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.523
Kids.Even more so.

31:56.566 --> 31:57.959
How old are Reynolds' kids?

31:58.003 --> 32:01.223
His oldest is... seven.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.184
KASIE:
Parenthood.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.273
They say
it changes everything.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.232
McGEE:
The soccer dad

32:10.276 --> 32:12.278
I thought it was crazy, too,
until we ran a background.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.801
Victim number two.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.412
Supermarket cashier
in Cortland, New York.

32:16.456 --> 32:19.285
And guess who was a grad student
at nearby Ithaca that same year.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.243
Victim number four,
truck driver found dead

32:21.287 --> 32:23.376
in Killington, Vermont.SLOANE:
Where Reynolds was working

32:23.419 --> 32:25.987
as a ski instructor
that very same winter.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.085
So, just a few things
we want to clear up

32:37.129 --> 32:39.740
about the burglary at your home.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.829
You had to bring me in
for this?

32:41.872 --> 32:43.396
It's in the police report.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.659
GIBBS: It's more about
Lieutenant Mooney's murder.

32:45.702 --> 32:48.749
We narrowed down his time
of death to the day after

32:48.792 --> 32:51.099
your place was robbed.

32:51.143 --> 32:55.625
Which, again, is why I'm glad
we weren't home at the time.

32:56.800 --> 33:00.239
Obviously,
Mooney wasn't so lucky.

33:00.282 --> 33:03.024
You were both at
soccer practice?

33:03.068 --> 33:04.765
Just Kenna.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.767
And it was a game.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.291
I was in New York on business.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.771
That right?

33:10.814 --> 33:13.687
Trade convention. I'm in sales.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.732
I was there the whole week.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.001
And what is that?

33:23.044 --> 33:25.220
We think it was Mooney
who broke into your house.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.185
It's what he came out with.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.751
What?

33:34.795 --> 33:38.103
In order to prove that you
were once known as The Dentist.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.539
Dentist?

33:39.582 --> 33:42.542
Okay, you lost me.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.284
I just said I was in sales.

33:48.809 --> 33:52.160
The Dentist
pulled these teeth

33:52.204 --> 33:55.598
from nine victims
over seven years ago.

33:59.341 --> 34:02.562
May I...

34:02.605 --> 34:04.564
have a glass of water?

34:04.607 --> 34:06.696
These teeth...

34:06.740 --> 34:09.090
they make you thirsty?

34:09.134 --> 34:11.136
Sickened.

34:13.007 --> 34:16.445
By the sight of them

34:16.489 --> 34:21.407
and the idea that you
somehow think I'm responsible.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.496
Cool as a cucumber.

34:23.539 --> 34:26.107
A psychotic cucumber.

34:26.151 --> 34:28.109
I think maybe you need a lawyer?

34:28.153 --> 34:29.806
Why?

34:29.850 --> 34:31.373
I've never seen

34:31.417 --> 34:33.201
these disgusting things.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.685
Now we're talking.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.733
And is this the part

34:43.777 --> 34:45.257
where you stab me?

34:56.050 --> 34:58.052
You know,
maybe I do need a lawyer.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.415
BISHOP:
We'll need some DNA.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.852
Get a court order.Oh, we intend to.

35:15.896 --> 35:18.028
And we will be checking
on your New York trip

35:18.072 --> 35:19.900
while you stay right here.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.380
Professional opinion?

35:21.423 --> 35:22.424
Of him or you?

35:22.468 --> 35:24.557
Guy's got one hell
of a poker face.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.036
All the best ones do,

35:26.080 --> 35:28.126
but, uh, his is, like,
way off the charts.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.998
Hey. You could have warned me.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.695
Eh.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.829
So...

35:35.872 --> 35:36.960
what do you think?

35:38.005 --> 35:40.181
He seems very
sure of himself.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.922
Or is he just playing with us?

35:46.231 --> 35:47.232
TORRES:
Name, number.

35:47.275 --> 35:48.842
I'll call you back.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.627
Okay, Nick.
Message number three.

35:51.671 --> 35:54.021
Call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.762
Oh, hey.

35:55.805 --> 35:57.024
Reynolds's alibi?McGEE:
Credit cards.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.026
Flight itinerary.
Hotel receipts.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.723
They all put him in New York
when Mooney was killed.

36:00.767 --> 36:02.247
Doesn't mean he's
not The Dentist.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.465
New York's only
a five-hour drive.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.119
Plus, that thing with his teeth?DUCKY:
Yes.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.207
The teeth.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.774
Lieutenant Mooney's skull

36:07.817 --> 36:09.645
has a full complement.
Therefore,

36:09.689 --> 36:11.908
his killer did not share

36:11.952 --> 36:14.868
The Dentist's penchant
for extraction.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.043
Then it wasn't The Dentist?

36:16.086 --> 36:17.697
No other evidence in the tub?

36:17.740 --> 36:20.134
Well, apart from
the box cutter blade,

36:20.178 --> 36:23.355
there's a small accumulation
of particles in the drain.

36:23.398 --> 36:27.228
Dr. Palmer is assisting Kasie
with them as we speak.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.664
From the very first punch,
Kasie, I swear,

36:28.708 --> 36:31.276
an adrenaline kicked in
like I've never felt before.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.973
Not even on the ledge last year?

36:33.016 --> 36:35.454
Ducky's book. Chapter six.

36:35.497 --> 36:38.152
It was more like a,
like a profound satisfaction

36:38.196 --> 36:40.720
and a deep regret
crashing together in my gut

36:40.763 --> 36:42.156
at the exact same time.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.897
: Oh, like me
and a pint of mint chip.

36:43.940 --> 36:47.422
It's like that but, um,
with legal consequences.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.597
Hmm.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.772
You want to see my mug shot?

36:49.816 --> 36:50.991
Ooh.

36:51.034 --> 36:52.122
You're the last hope, Kase.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.472
Agent Gibbs.

36:53.515 --> 36:54.777
"Boom Boom" Palmer.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.301
I-- look, go easy on
Torres, all right?

36:56.344 --> 36:57.563
Now, those guys really
had it coming...

36:57.606 --> 37:00.653
Sometimes hate deserves
a punch in the mouth.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.003
Yeah.
Don't do it again.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.179
Never.What about the box cutter?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.094
Nada. A two-week soak in the tub

37:07.137 --> 37:08.269
erased any prints or DNA

37:08.313 --> 37:10.445
that wasn't Lieutenant Mooney's.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.665
Oh, but there's our paint chip.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.014
What paint chip?
Oh,

37:14.057 --> 37:15.189
it's, uh, among the particles

37:15.233 --> 37:17.017
Jimmy scraped out
of the hot tub drain.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.149
It's almost microscopic,
but as you can see,

37:19.193 --> 37:20.325
it's a deep shade
of purple.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.762
Oh, wow, that's weird.

37:22.805 --> 37:23.893
What's weird?

37:23.937 --> 37:26.940
Its chemical breakdown.
Butyl acetate...

37:26.983 --> 37:29.116
nitrocellulose?

37:29.159 --> 37:30.683
That's not
a paint chip at all.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.032
Well, what is it?

37:38.473 --> 37:40.214
Ay-ay-ay.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.217
Some things just
never get clean, do they?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.045
You have no right
to hold Dan.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.612
He's done nothing wrong.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.702
Yeah, at first,
we didn't know for sure.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.051
Since he was in
such close proximity

37:51.094 --> 37:52.313
to two of the victims.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.880
Turns out someone else
was, too.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.969
What are you talking about?

37:56.012 --> 37:58.624
Your neighbor broke
into your house,
looking for something.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.756
It's the first thing that you
checked on when you got home.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.889
Second thing you did
is hide the nanny cam,

38:02.932 --> 38:05.544
so you could check it out
later, after the cops left.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.067
And then, when you saw
that it was Mooney

38:07.110 --> 38:09.069
who took your prized
collection,

38:09.112 --> 38:10.766
you waited until
he was vulnerable.

38:10.810 --> 38:11.811
In a hot tub.Yep.

38:11.854 --> 38:14.379
Where you took him out,
only to find

38:14.422 --> 38:16.250
he no longer had your teeth.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.556
Is that why you didn't
take his teeth?

38:17.599 --> 38:19.079
Smart move, by the way.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.559
Takes a lot
of impulse control.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.388
This is insane.
What... teeth?

38:23.431 --> 38:25.477
What prize collection?

38:25.520 --> 38:28.001
The one we ran for DNA,

38:28.044 --> 38:29.742
still matching
the victims' teeth

38:29.785 --> 38:32.222
and eventually the box to you.

38:32.266 --> 38:34.050
To me?

38:34.094 --> 38:35.704
Yeah.

38:35.748 --> 38:39.708
One little speck...
of purple nail polish.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.322
Gotcha.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.587
He was gonna ruin everything.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.459
I got past all that...

38:51.503 --> 38:54.114
a long time ago.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.029
I have everything I need now.

38:56.072 --> 38:59.032
A great husband
and beautiful kids.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.251
And some really bad
old habits.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.776
I was living a good life here.

39:03.819 --> 39:06.692
Until that...

39:06.735 --> 39:10.173
reporterfound me!

39:10.217 --> 39:13.263
I just couldn't let him
take it away.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.831
Hmm.

39:16.876 --> 39:18.573
You have no right.

39:18.617 --> 39:23.970
You know, you never really hear
about female serial killers.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.363
Actually, I looked it up.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.452
Turns out that one in six
are female.

39:27.495 --> 39:28.844
Really?
Huh.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.585
So it's not rare
at all.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.631
What could have
made her do it?

39:32.674 --> 39:34.415
We'll have to read
Mooney's book.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.286
Apparently, his ex-wife
is finishing it.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.550
You know, I keep going back
to soccer dad.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.247
How could he not have known?

39:40.290 --> 39:41.988
We're all occasionally guilty
of only seeing things

39:42.031 --> 39:43.772
we want to see.

39:43.816 --> 39:47.123
Love is blind.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.344
Hmm.
Indeed it is.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.042
Okay. On that note, I am out

39:53.086 --> 39:54.783
for a Scotch and a shower.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.481
Ah, you're not kidding.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.613
Or we can do wine
and some painting.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.093
Ah.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.444
Hey.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.272
You hear from Torres?

40:05.315 --> 40:07.535
Uh, no.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.711
No, and McGee's been
calling him, too.All right.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.757
I'll stop by his place
on my way home.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.759
Thanks, Gibbs.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.685
Nick?

40:26.728 --> 40:29.427
You catch the bad guy?

40:29.470 --> 40:31.472
What the hell are you
doing here?

40:31.516 --> 40:32.560
You don't answer my calls?

40:32.604 --> 40:34.519
You gonna answer
my question?
Yeah.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.477
We caught the bad guy.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.044
Am I still fired?

40:38.087 --> 40:40.263
No. What?
You were never fired.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.397
You were just sent home.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.444
Gibbs cares about you.
You know that, right?

40:50.752 --> 40:51.927
I couldn't fix 'em.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.712
Fix what?

40:58.586 --> 41:01.763
Oh, my God.
What...

41:01.807 --> 41:04.549
is it with those things?

41:04.592 --> 41:07.247
They were a gift.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.467
Oh.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.646
From Reeves.

41:22.131 --> 41:24.090
He was wearing them
one day to the gym,

41:24.133 --> 41:27.223
and I was like,
"Hey, cool shades,"

41:27.267 --> 41:28.442
but I really didn't like 'em.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.965
I was just being sarcastic.

41:30.009 --> 41:33.403
The next morning
they were on my desk.

41:33.447 --> 41:36.015
He bought you a pair?

41:36.058 --> 41:38.539
He gave me his.

41:43.022 --> 41:46.460
Yeah, well, he was kind.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.810
The kindest.

41:53.598 --> 41:54.686
Ellie.

41:58.733 --> 42:00.605
I miss my buddy.

42:03.564 --> 42:05.610
Me, too.

42:11.398 --> 42:14.749
Come on,
let's get inside.

42:14.793 --> 42:16.838
Come on.

42:16.882 --> 42:19.537
Here. You...

42:20.712 --> 42:22.235
You good?
Yeah.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.324
Okay.

42:24.367 --> 42:27.632
Oh... let's get
you some coffee.

42:27.675 --> 42:31.070
Okay. I mean, how
many did you have?

42:31.113 --> 42:32.419
How many do you want
to have?

42:32.462 --> 42:34.987
No, I won't-- okay,
you just go in there.
