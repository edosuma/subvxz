- Yeah.
- What do you like about it?

03:03.684 --> 03:07.288
Heavy metal was more of
an evolution, unlike punk rock.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.323
It evolved from hard rock bands

03:09.357 --> 03:12.460

the great thing about metal.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.179
That's, uh... It saved
rock and roll for the '80s.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.347
Well, I think heavy metal

03:33.381 --> 03:36.250
Is, is the true rock and roll
of the '80s.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.952
And rock and roll
was basically music

03:38.986 --> 03:42.990
Made by people who were thinking
with their crotches.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.092
Punk was getting to be techno.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.894
Punk was turning into
disco in disguise.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.162
It's faster and it's aggressive
and it's rebellious

03:49.196 --> 03:50.798
And their parents hate it.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.267

the mark of good rock and roll.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.828
You know what I'm saying?

37:42.861 --> 37:45.831
In heavy metal music, women
are portrayed to be abused.

37:45.864 --> 37:50.702
Um, they're kind of, uh,
being bound in chains.

37:50.736 --> 37:54.105
Many of the styles portray them
as having handcuffs on,

37:54.139 --> 37:56.508
Leg irons,
being locked in cages.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.510
There's a very brutal aspect

37:58.544 --> 38:00.579
Towards the woman
in heavy metal.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.181
'Cause it very much appeals
to the male macho image.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.452
I don't think people take girls
seriously in this sort of music.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.619
I don't know why that is.

38:07.653 --> 38:10.489
'Cause there hasn't been anybody
to prove

38:10.522 --> 38:13.091
That girls can
really, really rock.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.961
WOMAN: Can girls play
rock and roll as good as guys?

38:15.994 --> 38:17.663
- You bet.
- Damn right, we can.

38:17.696 --> 38:18.530
Shit.

38:18.564 --> 38:19.865
We rock. We kick ass.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.633
WOMAN: You get a lot of chicks
from being in a band?

38:21.667 --> 38:23.502
Oh, fuck, you get all the chicks
from being in a band.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.537
Especially the singer.
I get the most.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.038
Well, that's fine.
That's a stereotype.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.375
The minute a girl goes out with
a bunch of guys, she's a slut.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.643
- What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.713
Rock and roll and sex.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.148
Girls. Girls.

38:37.182 --> 38:40.318
Favorite past time.
Big tittied.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.220
What's your favorite past time?

38:42.253 --> 38:43.355
- Sex.
- Definitely.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.490
All the time.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.092
Every day,
at least three or four times.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.694
WOMAN: What kind of guys
do you like?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.896
Um, musicians, unfortunately.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.264
WOMAN: Why?

38:53.298 --> 38:57.469
Because they're irresponsible
assholes, but they look good.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.304
When I'm playing,
they seem so mesmerized

38:59.337 --> 39:01.206
By what I'm doing on stage.

39:01.239 --> 39:02.808
Instantly, they're mine,
you know.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.510
They have attitude.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.945
I know that sounds kind of
weird, but I like attitude.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.881
My personal taste?

39:10.749 --> 39:12.618
I like sluts.
I like slutty girls.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.453
I like girls that will
take off all their clothes

39:14.486 --> 39:17.022
Right in front of me
and dance in my face.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.557
That turns me on.

39:18.590 --> 39:19.925
WOMAN: Does this happen
a lot, Matthew?

39:19.958 --> 39:23.028
Yeah. It's a rock and roll band.
I mean, uh...

39:23.061 --> 39:24.329
It's all a combination.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.065
It's great to fell that hair
above you, you know.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.500
Falling down.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.736
WOMAN: So, when you're on stage
you're wearing the hair...

39:30.769 --> 39:31.703
No, in bed.

39:32.971 --> 39:37.375
- Or on the floor or the kitchen.
- The bathroom, on the table.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.644
WOMAN: Are you afraid
of getting AIDS?

39:38.677 --> 39:40.278
I never really thought about it.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.047
You can't screw someone
now, and think,

39:42.080 --> 39:43.449
"I just laid that chick."

39:43.482 --> 39:46.685
Because she's gonna go,
"Honey, you're dead." You know?

39:46.718 --> 39:49.154
You know, I, I myself,
I go with girls

39:49.187 --> 39:51.356
Whose step-dads
are gynecologists.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.958
So that really helps out a lot.

39:52.991 --> 39:56.361
- With the AIDS problem?
- Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.629
WOMAN: And birth control?

39:57.663 --> 40:00.832
Um, I don't really
worry about that.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.668
WOMAN: A lot of girls
chase after you?

40:04.302 --> 40:06.271
Yes, they do.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.740
You chicks take care
of me a lot.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.009
Why, I just had this chick
sow up my pants today or else

40:11.042 --> 40:13.612
You guys could see my dick
hanging out the bottom here.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.413
WOMAN: She didn't do
a very good job dude.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.515
If it's not money,

40:16.548 --> 40:18.550
It's taking us here,
taking us there.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.719
- You know,
- Buying us new clothes...

40:20.752 --> 40:23.154
- and boots.
- Yeah, got some new pants.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.090
It's kind of a rule that,
chicks don't get in the house

40:25.123 --> 40:27.392
Unless they have
a sack of groceries with them.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.760
You know?

40:28.794 --> 40:30.696
Yeah, let me tell you,
when your stomach's growling,

40:30.729 --> 40:32.731
You haven't had anything for a
couple of days, you don't...

40:32.764 --> 40:35.867
All of a sudden, your moral
values just sorta like...

40:35.901 --> 40:38.103
Okay, hon, if you want
to pay for dinner.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.304
That's fine with me.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.706
WOMAN: You know a lot of guys
in this scene

40:40.739 --> 40:43.174
Let girls take care
of them financially.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.309
What do you thing about that?

40:44.342 --> 40:45.544
I think that's sad.

40:45.577 --> 40:46.878
Sounds horrible.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.781
In a sense it's a form
of prostitution.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.083
WOMAN: Would you ever
go out with a girl just so
that, you know

40:52.117 --> 40:54.452
She would pay for some food
even if you didn't like her.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.755
Um, yeah.

40:58.089 --> 41:01.226
- Yeah, I would.
- WOMAN: Isn't that prostitution?

41:01.259 --> 41:03.895
Uh, no, I wouldn't see
it that way.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.064
- No.
- I wouldn't see it that way. No.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.933
WOMAN: Would you let some guy
pay for you?

41:07.966 --> 41:08.867
No.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.435
WOMAN: What are you going to do
for them?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.704
Anything they want right now
that I can do.

41:12.738 --> 41:13.972
WOMAN: What do you do for them?

41:15.741 --> 41:16.975
You know, when I have
a little money

41:17.008 --> 41:19.044
I'll be them the nice things
some pretty furs...

41:19.077 --> 41:20.679
And the, the cars
and the Rolls Royces.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.581
And the whole,
the whole shebang.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.683
- You're gonna remember them?
- Oh, yeah!

41:27.653 --> 41:29.588
WOMAN: How long
have London been together?

41:29.621 --> 41:32.490
- Too fucking long. Since 1979.
- Uh-huh.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.625
Yeah, well, this is like

41:33.659 --> 41:35.627
The uh, training school
for rock stars.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.563
'Cause see we get somebody
in the band

41:37.596 --> 41:40.365
And uh, as soon as they leave
they become rock stars.

41:40.398 --> 41:41.967
WOMAN: So, who else
was in your band?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.070
Couple of dudes from
Guns N' Roses.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.705
A dude from, uh, W.A.S.P.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.140
And, uh, Nikki Sixx
from Mötley Crüe.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.976
Freddy Coury of Cinderella.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.644
Well, I like to tell you
that, uh,

41:52.678 --> 41:54.145
We do appreciate you guys
being here

41:54.179 --> 41:56.715
And we would like to have
you're co-operation

41:56.748 --> 41:58.717
To make us look bitching.
All right!

41:58.750 --> 42:00.752
You see, we've been in this town
for so long

42:00.786 --> 42:03.488
That we're like a cheap hooker
on the street.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.956
Nobody wants to know about us.

42:04.990 --> 42:08.493
So, what happens is we, we have
a big following out of town,

42:08.526 --> 42:10.428
We come back here,
they offer us 50 bucks

42:10.461 --> 42:12.397
To play the Troubadour
or whatever.

42:12.430 --> 42:14.432
- On a Tuesday.
- On a Tuesday.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.835
But, we will do it
for a bar tab.

42:16.868 --> 42:20.171
So, you guys are
gonna be in the picture
right here, so...

42:20.205 --> 42:22.040
If you can just like...

42:22.073 --> 42:24.843
Stick your hands up in the air
and make yourselves look...

42:24.876 --> 42:26.745
Show us your under-alls.
All right!

42:26.778 --> 42:29.715
Oh! You want to hear
about Arizona.

42:29.748 --> 42:32.918
Well, I just found out when
I was in my hotel room that,

42:32.951 --> 42:35.921
That, that oral sex was illegal.

42:35.954 --> 42:37.355
- Now that fucking...
- By three years.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.657
That fucking bummed me out.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.158
He loves to eat pussy.

42:40.191 --> 42:44.195
Can you imagine.
You're under arrest for...

42:44.229 --> 42:45.363
Now, come on.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.932
We were rather shocked
to hear that really.

42:46.965 --> 42:48.934
Yeah, but unfortunately
we did break the law

42:48.967 --> 42:50.869
An awful lot
when we were in Arizona.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.570
Girls in other cities are great

42:52.604 --> 42:54.539
Because uh,
it's always two or three

42:54.572 --> 42:56.675
That are totally loaded
with money.

42:56.708 --> 42:57.976
Here's what London is...

42:58.009 --> 43:01.179
Our dicks get real hard
for gold cards.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.881
They do. They do.

43:02.914 --> 43:03.982
No.

43:04.015 --> 43:06.918
You guys are fucking
losing it, man.

43:08.153 --> 43:10.388
You're not here for me.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.523
You're here for you know what.

43:12.557 --> 43:14.192
Women make you feel
very, very good

43:14.225 --> 43:16.394
When they're out in front of you
and they just start fucking

43:16.427 --> 43:20.098
Sucking their own hands
and sucking their own fingers

43:20.131 --> 43:24.002
And throwing notes at you
and taking their tops off.

43:24.035 --> 43:26.772
Oh, my God!
Not more fog.

43:26.805 --> 43:29.440
First of all, girls like it
when you talk dirty to them.

43:29.474 --> 43:31.176
Especially right here.

43:31.209 --> 43:34.846
Okay. You just tell them
you want to bang them...

43:34.880 --> 43:38.449
Kiss their toes,
lift their butt up in the air

43:38.483 --> 43:40.819
And you look at her
with the lights...

43:53.631 --> 43:57.035
We are not role models
for your life.

44:07.112 --> 44:09.314
My hands are tied

44:09.347 --> 44:11.482
My back's to the wall

44:11.516 --> 44:13.719
Nowhere to hide

44:13.752 --> 44:16.321
No escape from it all, yeah

44:16.354 --> 44:18.656
Pick of the town

44:18.690 --> 44:20.391
Living in the fast lane

44:21.192 --> 44:22.994
Running around

44:23.028 --> 44:26.431
Well, they need
those money skies, yeah

44:26.464 --> 44:28.934
Times I like new love

44:31.202 --> 44:34.873
There's a place to go

44:34.906 --> 44:37.843
And I went with this chick.
Well, this chick is all weird.

44:37.876 --> 44:38.944
She was using these cuffs

44:38.977 --> 44:40.678
And there was nowhere
to cuff me up.

44:40.712 --> 44:42.280
And she wanted to cuff me up.

44:42.313 --> 44:44.783
And all there was, was a desk
with handles.

44:44.816 --> 44:47.118
So she used the handle
of a fucking drawer.

44:47.152 --> 44:48.754
WOMAN: Why did she wanna
cuff you up?

44:48.787 --> 44:52.490
Because she wanted to sit there
and play with herself.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.559
- Okay?
- With you cuffed to the desk?

44:54.592 --> 44:56.261
Yeah. Shit, I loved it.

44:56.294 --> 44:59.230
Anyway, she left me there.
I fell asleep.

44:59.264 --> 45:00.331
And I'm like this.

45:01.099 --> 45:03.234
Ooh, breakout!

45:26.958 --> 45:27.993
Hey!

45:41.039 --> 45:42.673
WOMAN: When was the last time
you had a job?

45:42.707 --> 45:44.776
Eight years ago. [LAUGHING]

45:44.810 --> 45:47.412
We don't work, this is...
We play music.

45:47.445 --> 45:48.947
Well, I've never had a job.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.115
The girls have always,

45:50.148 --> 45:52.183
The girls have always been
very generous.

45:52.217 --> 45:54.652
Well, I'm currently like,
I'm still employed.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.154
I'm a professional gynecologist.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.957
WOMAN: No, when was
the last time you had a job.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.792
Well, uh, this is my job.

46:00.826 --> 46:03.328
Uh, as far as I'm concerned
this is what I do.

46:03.361 --> 46:05.864
I believe in it, you know, this
is rock 'n' roll. I do this.

46:05.897 --> 46:07.799
So, I mean,
I don't consider that, uh,

46:07.833 --> 46:10.135
I'm like, lazy or something
'cause I don't do a job.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.503
Because I bust my fucking ass
doing rock and roll.

46:12.537 --> 46:13.704
WOMAN: Do you always have money?

46:13.738 --> 46:16.107
Sometimes we do
and sometimes we don't.

46:16.141 --> 46:17.976
We're, we're in debt
for 100 grand.

46:18.009 --> 46:19.477
Right now, yes, we are.

46:19.510 --> 46:20.979
But we're getting out of that.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.713
WOMAN: How could you be in debt
for 100 grand?

46:22.747 --> 46:24.015
We bought a lot of equipment.

46:24.049 --> 46:26.751
Our last album we did
was financed by this guy

46:26.784 --> 46:29.487
Who was in jail, right?
[LAUGHING]

46:29.520 --> 46:30.956
Yeah, but...

46:30.989 --> 46:33.324
He's out now.
And now he wants his money.

46:33.358 --> 46:35.360
All right. See this?

46:37.128 --> 46:38.796
You know, that bullshit going
on out there

46:38.830 --> 46:41.032
For the fucking Russians, huh?

46:41.066 --> 46:43.434
I'm sick of listening
to these motherfuckers.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.170
[DRUM ROLL]

46:46.037 --> 46:47.105
You know, how they say

46:47.138 --> 46:49.474
The Russians
are coming over here.

46:49.507 --> 46:50.675
They cause shit.

46:50.708 --> 46:52.878
Ha ha, surprise.

46:57.548 --> 46:59.650
Uh oh, this fucker's tough.

46:59.684 --> 47:00.886
MAN: Burn it.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.921
Come on, mother fucker.
I ain't got all day.

47:04.555 --> 47:07.225
This song is for the Russians.

47:07.258 --> 47:10.595
This is called Russian Winter.

[SCREAMING]

47:24.309 --> 47:25.843

47:29.314 --> 47:33.584
We were making flame pots
for this song, Russian Winter.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.586
And what we did was, we uh,

47:35.620 --> 47:37.956
Wanted big flames,
so we put

47:37.989 --> 47:42.527
A lot of extra gun powder
and flash powder together.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.497
So, we basically got your uh,
standard concussion bombs.

Again and again

so called to do business.

48:26.104 --> 48:27.838
I went and did nothing.

48:27.872 --> 48:29.907
This cop was sending us...

48:29.941 --> 48:32.377
Douche bag. I mean,
this guy was an idiot.

48:32.410 --> 48:33.778

48:33.811 --> 48:36.181

and he goes, "Get out of here!"

48:36.214 --> 48:37.848
"Come on,
get your ass out of here."

48:37.882 --> 48:39.684
And I go, "Fuck you!"

48:39.717 --> 48:41.052
- To the cop.
- Oh, yeah!

48:41.086 --> 48:42.487
He was a fucking...

48:42.520 --> 48:46.191

this is not an alley cop.

and they look big

And pissed off
and they are ready to kick ass.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.065

with the door open

48:54.099 --> 48:55.733

I'd probably be in prison.

50:58.389 --> 50:58.556
Why is that?

51:00.024 --> 51:01.992
Because I just want... I didn't
want to get a regular job.

in factories

this sort of a...

with it.

we were thugs.

fast cars and everything.

and that's because...

Because we came from
the back streets of Birmingham,

of money in the early days.

on day,

"Hey, we must be earning
a lot more"

and alcoholics and everything.

in a rehabilitation center.

took LSD, we took cocaine,

vast amounts of marijuana.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.049
If you don't make it?

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:27.951
Well, there's nothing else
that I can really do

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.119
Except music, you know.

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:30.387
And that's how I feel.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.622
That's all I really wanna do
in my life is music,

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.923
And if I can't do that

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:36.093
Then fuck everything else
around me, really.

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:40.497
12 o'clock
12 o'clock

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.599
12 o'clock high

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:49.639
Twelve o'clock high

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.747
WOMAN: Do you think that
you're gonna be a rock star?

01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:01.418
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm going to be
a famous rock star, yeah.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.853
Yeah. Yes, I wanna be
a rock star.

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:05.222
Gonna be rock stars.

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:09.359
I'm going to be a rock star.
I am going to be.

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:12.796
We wouldn't mind,
being rock stars.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.098
But...

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:18.502
As long as, rock star is
defined as rich and... rich.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:21.371
I think that it'll come
pretty easily for me.

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:24.007
You know, 'cause I'm different
from everyone else.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.942
WOMAN: What if you don't
make it as a rockstar?

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.211
Oh, I will.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:29.813
WOMAN: But if you don't,
in 10 years,

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:31.115
What are you going to be doing?

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.416
See, I will though, see.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:33.983
WOMAN: What if
you don't make it?

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:36.353
- But I will.
- I will make it.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.755
- For sure?
- I'm not gonna quit until I do.

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:41.925
The main key is perseverance.
And I will persevere.

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.027
That question is not in my mind.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.196
The minute you doubt,
is the minute you lose it.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:47.664
What if I don't make it?

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:52.136
I'll find a vacant drainage
ditch or something...

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:53.570
Lay my bed down.

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:55.139
I don't know...

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:58.375
End up on skid row or something,
I don't know.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.843
I don't know where I'm gonna be.

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:02.312
WOMAN: Doesn't it
worry you?

01:08:02.346 --> 01:08:03.280
No.

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.615
I'm like him,
that doesn't enter my mind.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:10.620
I can't really,
I can't picture not making it.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:14.258
You see, if you came
and heard us, you'd really...

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.024
You'd think the same thing too.

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:17.794
WOMAN: That you are,
definitely gonna make it?

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.062
Oh, yeah.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.564
WOMAN: What if 10 years from now
it doesn't happen?

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.234
I don't believe that,

01:08:24.268 --> 01:08:26.636
That it won't, because you can
do anything in life you want.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.872
There ain't nothing
in this world you can't do.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.774
- Do you have a back up plan?
- No.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:34.544
No such thing.
No back up.

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:36.112
I don't know how
to do anything else.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:38.615
We rock 'n' roll.
That's all we do.

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:39.983
I'm a singer.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:42.051
- Well, I got no choice.
- Why?

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:46.689
We all fucked up in school.
We all, you know, we're just...

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:48.725
This is what we're here for.

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:51.194
WOMAN: What if you don't
end up a rock star?

01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:55.299
Well, if I don't,
then I'll die trying.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.466
What do you think
your tombstone will say?

01:08:57.501 --> 01:09:00.270
I don't want a tombstone,
I just...

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:03.273
I just want somebody to dig
a ditch and throw me in,

01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:04.841
"See you later, pal,
have a good one".

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:09.513
WOMAN: When you were
a little kid,

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:10.814
Did you want to be a rock star?

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:12.716
Yes, I did. Definitely.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.684
She wouldn't let me.

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:19.788
I go, "Mom, can I take
rock guitar?"

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:20.290
She says "Well..."

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:26.229
"No, you can't 'cause you will,
you'll turn to one of those"

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:27.863
"Drug infested rock stars."

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.968
- Do you like touring?
- Yeah, I love it.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.571
I met women.
Like...

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:39.042
In my whole term...
four of them at a time.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.245
Say "Hey, take your drawers off"

01:09:42.446 --> 01:09:46.216
And if they don't, I call my
security guard next door,

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.984
They come,
he throws them right out.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.287
"Get outta here".

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.258
WOMAN: What do you think
about that, Sandy?

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.892
I don't think about it.

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.594
If you can tour one year,

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:02.566
If you can tour... one year,

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:05.435
It'll take
four years off your life.

01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:09.373
You know five,
four years, five.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:16.413
WOMAN: So, Chris, how many
gold records do you have?

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:18.114
Shit, one, two, three,
four, five, si...

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:20.750
I don't know. Who cares?
Who knows?

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.219
I don't know.

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.656
- So do you...
- Five, six, 10, 12, who cares?

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.793
- Do you consider yourself...
- A piece of crap.

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:32.796
Why?

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.131
Well, because, you know
I don't work a job

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.800
And I'm a piece of crap.

01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:43.006
WOMAN: Does it bother you
that this lifestyle

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:45.475
Is dangerous to your health?

01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:47.511
Health?
What do you mean, health?

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:50.146
Look at me.
I look 40?

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.781
- 30?
- How old are you?

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:52.849
I'm 29.

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.586
I'm what they call,
an old fuck.

01:10:58.054 --> 01:10:59.389
Look at my mom! Shit!

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.492
WOMAN: What do you think
you're gonna

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:03.727
Be doing in 10 years from now?

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:06.530
Ten? I'll probably be dead.

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:08.832
You can come see my graveyard.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:10.300
Mom, have a drink.

01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:12.636
- Chris? Do you drink very much?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.471
- Pardon?
- Do you drink very much?

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:17.774
Yes, I do.
I'm a full blown alcoholic.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.276
Just when he's awake.

01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:22.479
I drink too much.

01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:25.782
WOMAN: Okay,
why do you drink that much?

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:27.317
'Cause I enjoy it.

01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:29.218
Do you think a
rock 'n' roll lifestyle

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:31.488
- turns you into an alcoholic?
- Yes, it does.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:35.725
WOMAN: How much of that
do you drink a day?

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:36.626
About...

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:40.330
- Five pints
- Of vodka?

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.500
Five quarts, pints, who cares?

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:46.069
I'm a happy camper.

01:11:47.571 --> 01:11:51.007
WOMAN: Do you think, maybe,
just kind of, you know...

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.112
Rock 'n' roll lifestyle is hard
on you and that's why you drink?

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.648
I'm a full blown alcoholic

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:04.153
And why I drink, is 'cause...
look...

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:05.489
What?

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:09.893
WOMAN: Why do you drink, Chris?

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:14.931
'Cause it makes me happy...
Happy.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:21.705
I enjoy drinking.
I just enjoy life.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:27.176
I'm the happiest son of a
bitch and motherfucker,
there ever was.

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.513
WOMAN: Why do you get
so loaded though?

01:12:29.546 --> 01:12:32.949
'Cause it's
the only thing that...

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:35.118
Lets me get free, you know...

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:39.723
WOMAN: You think you might be
covering up some pain?

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:40.790
Yeah, little bit.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:43.993
WOMAN: Where would that be from,
I wonder?

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:47.431
Here... Do you like this label?

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:53.136
WOMAN: Let's not avoid
the issue.
Where would that be from?

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:54.971
This...
Okay... here...

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:57.006
WOMAN: Do you wish... Chris?

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:00.644
Do you wish that you were...

01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.947
A bigger star,
than you are right now?

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:04.981
Do I wish what?

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:08.051
That you were a bigger star
than you are?

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.419
Not really.

01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:11.488
I wish I was a smaller star.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:14.458
I don't dig
being the person I am.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.061
And...

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:20.797
I just don't like it.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:22.499
I just don't...

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:27.036
Been the person who...
Who's like...

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.074
Excuse me...

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:35.111
Being who I am is like...

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.014
Here, watch.

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:46.490
I had a whiskey bottle the size
of the Empire State building

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:48.658
In front of me all the time.

01:13:48.692 --> 01:13:50.393
I have a disease
called alcoholism

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.729
And drug... drug...
drug dependency.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:55.665
I am actually an alcoholic now,
I guess I think...

01:13:55.699 --> 01:13:58.635
I'm probably about four on the
Richter scale of alcoholism.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:02.071
I was always at about 3.2,
at all times.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:04.541
If I would've been stopped
driving at any time,

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.943
Even if I hadn't anything
to drink for two weeks,

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:08.745
I would still have been
legally drunk.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.013
I'd get tired of waking up

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.182
Hungover, having to do
a couple of lines,

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:16.686
And a couple of beers,
just to get moving, you know.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.887
Which is where I was at...

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.556
Then you gotta get the act
together

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.024
So you can go
and cop dope.

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:23.392
WOMAN: What was
the Betty Ford Clinic like?

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:25.729
Boring.
No, actually...

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:28.765
The educational value was okay,
it made me realize

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.835
That I was an alcoholic
and that I am a drug addict.

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:34.771
But still, I am an alcoholic.
You always are, you know.

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:38.508
- But you feel better now?
- No.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:41.244
But after a while,
when you do it so much,

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:42.912
It's like the same
as the first time.

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:45.148
It turns into a...
you know, it turns against you

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:48.618
- especially with drugs.
- Did rock 'n' roll do it to ya?

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:50.086
Yeah, well, I guess
it did because

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:53.422
We got a free bottle backstage
every show you see, so...

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:55.291
I mean you don't wanna leave
the last

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.961
Quarter of the bottle so you
tend to finish it up, you know.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.598
The worst thing I can imagine
is hurting yourself.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.432
You may as well
just jump off a building,

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:04.568
I mean what's the difference?

01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:06.002
These bands really
wanna make it.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.004
They stay away from drugs,
maybe these kids will do

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:10.674
The drugs that float for free,
every once in a while

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.642
But that doesn't happen much.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:14.043
It's just
there is not enough time.

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:17.146
Most of the kids who wanna
make it stay away from drugs.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.016
- No, I'm not into drugs.
- I think drugs suck.

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:23.286
It's bullshit. We've seen it
ruin a lot of people.

01:15:23.319 --> 01:15:26.089
Personally, I find that I don't
need drugs to have a good time.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:29.993
All I need is loud music,
and a lot of friends.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.228
I don't think you can
enjoy a show,

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.598
If you go and get wasted,
you know,

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.465
Don't even remember
the show the next day.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.935
Basically, the metal
is a drug to me

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:42.739
I don't need it to get strung
out or anything, if I hear

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:46.810
Like Sabbath Volume Four,
that is my drug.

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.478
You can't be a musician
and a drug addict.

01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:50.914
Neither one nor the other.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.418
I don't know, people ask me
if I am an alcoholic,

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:58.755
I guess you can consider me
an alcoholic, I drink every day.

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:01.257
I don't think
I let it affect my life.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.558
I show up for band practice,

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.761
I mean that's
all that's important.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.696
We do drugs, we do alcohol.

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.898
It doesn't mean
you should do it.

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.334
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
used to be a fun thing to do

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:12.836
But it ain't any more.

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:16.339
You can play Russian Roulette
for five years and

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:17.741
Never get hurt and then one time

01:16:17.774 --> 01:16:19.308
You pull the trigger
and it's all over.

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:21.845
The thing is, belief in yourself
should be the drug, really.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.781
Your confidence is what
should really inspire you

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:27.150
And keep you going
to do what you wanna do.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:29.485
Think a lot of people look to
people in show business

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.287
Or anybody who's famous

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.889
To model their lifestyle on.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:36.359
One of my role models was Keith
and every once in a while

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:40.196
I'd see him...
We'd exchange goodies.

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:44.834
But I always looked up to him
for the way of life that he

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:47.771
Lived, and it was a way of life
for him, it still is.

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:50.539
And sometimes,
they're your friends and...

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:52.475
You have to stop
being their friend

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.443
When they don't listen because

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:56.445
It's like somebody drowning.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:59.082
They'll drag you down with them,
it's just not worth it.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:02.051
So... if you're modeling
your lifestyle on somebody

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:04.487
And it turns out that they died
on smack,

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.555
That's not very clever, see.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.491
I don't think
there's anything admirable

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:09.893
About being a dead legend,

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:13.262
And that's probably
the reason why I'm not into it.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.932
It was killing me,
and I felt that I was probably

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.867
Much more effective
alive than dead.

01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:19.602

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:37.540
That you have to freaking
keep your wits about you.

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:39.675
This music is technical music,
it is

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:43.312
Harder to play than most of the
other rock bands out there and,

01:24:43.346 --> 01:24:45.448
I think that you need to
keep your chops in shape,

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:47.183
You need to
keep your health in shape.

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:48.751
And I'm not gonna
cheat the audience that way,

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:51.354
I don't get high when I'm
practicing at home alone,

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:53.856
So why should I do it
when I go up on stage?

01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:55.358
I mean, as far
as I'm concerned,

01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:57.260
A band should go up on stage

01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:59.695
And play for themselves,
not having to put make-up on

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:01.130
And stuff like that.

01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:03.832
I mean, it's like a wall of
Marshalls and your band playing,

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:05.201
That's a show for me.

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:09.705
[PLAYING IN MY DARKEST HOUR]

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.682
In my hour of need,

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:24.753
Ha, no, you're not there

01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:29.192
And though I reached
out for you

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:33.362
Wouldn't lend a hand

01:25:34.763 --> 01:25:37.833
Through the darkest hour

01:25:39.402 --> 01:25:40.803
DAVE: Well we get categori zed

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:44.207
Into a lot of different metal
monikers...

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.441
WOMAN: What so far?

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.710
Megadeth, that's the best
way to explain us

01:25:47.743 --> 01:25:50.313
Because we don't really
like to be labeled anything,

01:25:50.346 --> 01:25:53.849
I think categorization is a sin
because it cuts you off

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:56.785
It doesn't let you go any far,
you can't expand,

01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:59.822
Some of the satanic bands,
they can't write anything about

01:25:59.855 --> 01:26:03.559
Politics or love or anything
like that or no love or whatever

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:06.295
Because they're dealing
strictly with Satan.

01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:10.666
WOMAN: So, Dave, how come
you write about death so much?

01:26:10.699 --> 01:26:13.936
Not only death, it's more about
awareness you know

01:26:13.969 --> 01:26:15.938
Because without death
life would be

01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:17.340
Meaningless, don't you think?

01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:20.909
Raise your head, raise your
face, your eyes

01:26:20.943 --> 01:26:22.545
I mean life, death, sex,

01:26:23.312 --> 01:26:25.414
- pretty happening to me.
- Yeah.

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:28.651
- What else is there?
- Beer, maybe.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:29.752
Beer!

01:26:29.785 --> 01:26:31.754
[WOMAN LAUGHS]

01:26:42.498 --> 01:26:47.270
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land

01:26:47.303 --> 01:26:49.838
There's a better place for me

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:53.108
But it's far, far away

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:57.212
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world

01:26:57.246 --> 01:26:59.147
But I gotta die first

01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:03.252
Please, God, send me on my way

01:27:11.427 --> 01:27:14.763
Time has a way of taking time

01:27:14.797 --> 01:27:19.602
Loneliness is not only
Felt by fools

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:23.372
Alone I call to ease the pain

01:27:23.406 --> 01:27:25.874
Yearning to be held by you

01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:28.210
Alone so alone I'm lost

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.145
Consumed by the pain

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:33.516
The pain, the pain, the pain,

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:36.352
Won't you hold me again?

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:39.822
And you just laughed,
ha ha, bitch

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:43.426
My whole life is work
Built on the past

01:27:43.459 --> 01:27:48.163
But the time has come
When all things shall pass

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:51.367
This good thing passed away

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:09.452

01:29:25.728 --> 01:29:27.362
DAVE: When it starts going
to your head

01:29:27.396 --> 01:29:31.834
And you start thinking that
you're God, it's stupid!

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:34.537
Because in my book,
there's always somebody better.

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:35.704
It's like David Lee Roth said,

01:29:35.738 --> 01:29:37.305
You're here today,
gone later today

01:29:37.339 --> 01:29:38.641
WOMAN: You guys
get signed yet?

01:29:38.674 --> 01:29:41.243
It's getting close,
very close.

Everybody in rock 'n' roll,
heavy rock,

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:45.648
Is supposed to be stupid,
and we're not stupid.

01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:48.283
Rock 'n' roll should corrupt
kids enough to think.

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:50.519
There's nothing wrong
with thinking.

01:29:50.553 --> 01:29:52.320
They will not stop
rock 'n' roll.

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:53.556
This is what it is.

01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:56.559
To be a rock 'n' roll star

01:29:56.592 --> 01:29:58.093
Is the greatest thing
in the world

01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:00.328
Popes don't get laid and I do.

01:30:00.362 --> 01:30:01.830
Just be real careful,
wear a rubber,

01:30:01.864 --> 01:30:03.632
And don't do drugs,
what can I say?

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:05.801
Just remember one thing,

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:07.803
You meet lot of people
on the way up,

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:10.973
Don't fuck them 'cause you meet
them on the way down as well.

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:11.974
