19:31.171 --> 19:33.320
It wasn't a dream.
I was there.

19:33.414 --> 19:37.750
There's no reliable way
I'll ever know.

19:37.919 --> 19:40.327
Either way, Dad, it's wonderful.

19:40.421 --> 19:42.663

<i> You have found closure.</i>

19:42.831 --> 19:44.423
<i> Closure. Disclaimer:</i>

19:44.517 --> 19:48.502
<i>Closure is no longer considered</i>
<i>a valid psychological construct.</i>

19:48.521 --> 19:49.687
<i> Closure!</i>

19:49.838 --> 19:53.065
This is the best
Mother's Day ever.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.652
ALL:
Aw...

19:58.256 --> 20:00.198
-Aw...
-(Marge groans)

20:00.425 --> 20:02.516
Or it will be the best
Mother's Day ever.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.369
Once I take your mother to
the finest restaurant in town.

20:05.521 --> 20:08.206
Where I actually
made reservations.

20:08.357 --> 20:11.500
(gasps) This is the best
Mother's Day ever!

20:12.879 --> 20:15.955
Everything I need
is in this room.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.384
Sir, this is not a buffet.
Please stay out of the kitchen.

20:20.536 --> 20:23.596
When a sign says "brunch,"
I brunch.

20:31.714 --> 20:33.231
(blipping)

20:39.464 --> 20:41.072
(panting)
Honey, can we

20:41.223 --> 20:41.964
have dinner
on the floor tonight?

20:42.057 --> 20:43.466
No.
