00:07.398 --> 00:09.430
Ready for this
shit storm that's coming?

00:09.431 --> 00:11.130
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies:

00:11.131 --> 00:13.830
<i>This aggression of yours</i>
<i>will no longer</i>

00:13.831 --> 00:15.097
be tolerated.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.497
Is that straight
enough for you?

00:17.498 --> 00:19.363
<i>- I'm leaving the company.</i>
<i>- Soak it all in,</i>

00:19.364 --> 00:22.063
'cause by this time tomorrow,
we don't work here anymore.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.330
To Kaan and Associates.

00:23.331 --> 00:24.430
Kaan and Associates.

00:24.431 --> 00:25.330
That's it.

00:25.331 --> 00:27.563
You got to think about
the little ones.

00:27.564 --> 00:28.730
Doug.
Clyde.

00:28.731 --> 00:32.463
Oh, my God, those are
the exact names I picked out!

00:32.464 --> 00:34.830
Hey, hey, Jeannie, can I talk to
you for a second?
No.

00:34.831 --> 00:37.197
Shut the fuck up, Doug.
Shut the fuck up, Doug.

00:37.198 --> 00:39.863
'Cause the people you work with
don't respect you. The fact that

00:39.864 --> 00:42.663
you don't see it kind of makes you
seem like a putz.

00:42.664 --> 00:44.597
<i>Why would you hit</i>
<i>on my girlfriend?</i>

00:44.598 --> 00:46.963
<i>I feel truly sorry for you.</i>

00:46.964 --> 00:49.230
Is this what you're like when
you start getting laid, man?

00:49.231 --> 00:51.830
<i>Let's get married</i>
<i>in Vegas tomorrow.</i>

00:51.831 --> 00:54.197
I have decided to stay
at Galweather.

00:54.198 --> 00:56.330
<i>I thought my thing with Marty</i>

00:56.331 --> 00:58.163
<i>was just on a whole nother</i>
<i>level, man, I thought</i>

00:58.164 --> 01:00.097
<i>as friends, but he doesn't give</i>
<i>a fuck about me.</i>

01:00.180 --> 01:01.045
Why should I?

01:01.046 --> 01:04.280
Because I'm about to make
you mountains of cash.

01:05.946 --> 01:08.479
Who's your spy, Mike?!
Who's your fucking spy?!

01:08.480 --> 01:10.079
I fucking told 'em.
What?

01:10.080 --> 01:12.745
So why don't you get
the fuck off my client?!

01:12.844 --> 01:13.877
I love you.

01:13.878 --> 01:15.343
Jesus, Jeannie.

01:15.344 --> 01:17.343
Jesus, Jeannie...

01:17.344 --> 01:19.177
Hey, Jeannie, I can't do this
without you, okay?

01:19.178 --> 01:20.877
I can't do any of it
without you.

01:20.878 --> 01:23.210
So stop being a baby.

01:23.211 --> 01:26.478
You're a fucking idiot.

Hey, man.
Ow.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.777
All right, thanks so much.

01:52.778 --> 01:54.843
Mmm. Mm!

01:54.844 --> 01:57.544
Marty.
Marty Kaan!

01:58.711 --> 02:00.010
Marty, I need five minutes.

02:00.011 --> 02:03.543
Oh, I need 'em more.
Ah!

02:03.544 --> 02:04.577
Hi.
Hey.

02:05.644 --> 02:06.643
Jeannie?

02:06.644 --> 02:09.776
Hey.

02:11.244 --> 02:12.477
How'd you get in here?

02:12.478 --> 02:13.977
I have powerful connections.

02:13.978 --> 02:16.410
No, I'm serious.
What are you doing here?

02:16.411 --> 02:20.243
I thought you wanted me here.

02:20.244 --> 02:21.643
Of course I want you here,

02:21.644 --> 02:23.710
but you haven't answered
any of my phone calls or...

02:23.711 --> 02:25.743
Are you coming back or what?

02:25.744 --> 02:28.444
I'm already here. Now.

02:30.078 --> 02:32.343
Right in front of you.

Jeannie, what's going on?

02:58.678 --> 03:01.043
This is exactly where
we're supposed to be.

03:01.044 --> 03:03.011
Just stay here.
Stay with me.

03:11.378 --> 03:14.477
Jeannie?

03:14.478 --> 03:16.643
Are you all right?

03:16.644 --> 03:17.978
There's some turbulence.

03:20.778 --> 03:21.910
Who's Jeannie?

03:21.911 --> 03:25.411
Uh, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.411
Robert.

03:53.211 --> 03:56.277
Robert! Okay, about to be fired.
Pod, keep up!

03:56.278 --> 03:58.211
Trying.

04:00.244 --> 04:02.043
Robert, buddy?

04:02.044 --> 04:05.310
Marty, do I have two minutes
to buy some duck?

04:05.311 --> 04:08.943
Robert?

04:08.944 --> 04:11.943
Where the fuck is Caitlin, Will?

04:11.944 --> 04:14.443
Caitlin, let's go!

04:14.444 --> 04:20.343
Oh! Oh, goddamn it!
Uh! I broke a heel.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.976
Heels? That's a fucking
great choice.

04:21.978 --> 04:24.643
Well, I thought we were going to a
boardroom, not a fucking bazaar.

04:24.644 --> 04:26.443
Girls...
That's a dead octopus.

04:26.444 --> 04:28.477
Knock that off
the fucking list.

04:28.478 --> 04:32.743
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
it's not just seaweed.

04:32.744 --> 04:34.677
Heirloom seaweed.

04:34.678 --> 04:37.077
Heirloom seaweed?
Why is it, why is it heirloom?

04:37.078 --> 04:38.277
Oh, the nuance,

04:38.278 --> 04:39.477
the subtleties.

04:39.478 --> 04:41.377
And as soon as you mention
"heirloom,"

04:41.378 --> 04:42.643
you justify a 40% markup.

04:42.644 --> 04:44.143
Say word.

04:44.144 --> 04:45.077
What?

04:45.078 --> 04:47.443
That is a great reason
to go with heirloom.

04:47.444 --> 04:49.377
Well, you are never gonna
find heirloom seaweed

04:49.378 --> 04:51.710
at that white-trash
Colossal Foods, I'll tell you that.

04:51.711 --> 04:52.877
You're goddamn right.

04:52.878 --> 04:55.477
And it's things like that
that set Free Range apart.

04:55.478 --> 04:56.410
That's right.

04:56.411 --> 04:57.477
Fuck the Wonder-Bread-

04:57.478 --> 04:58.810
and-food-stamps
crowd, am I right?

04:58.811 --> 04:59.810
Right!

04:59.811 --> 05:03.310
Hijiki... that is the
wave of the future.

05:03.311 --> 05:05.643
The Asians love
a sea vegetable.

05:05.644 --> 05:07.277
What China eats today,

05:07.278 --> 05:09.543
we'd better fucking
learn to love tomorrow.

05:09.544 --> 05:11.143
Say that shit two times.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.743
Hey, you got to try this.
It is a revelation.

05:13.744 --> 05:15.777
No, no!
Huh? Come on.

05:15.778 --> 05:16.544
Huh?

05:21.778 --> 05:22.944
Mm!

05:24.711 --> 05:27.843
Oh, motherfucker!

05:27.844 --> 05:30.544
Shit tastes like the ass
of a sick fish.

05:33.011 --> 05:35.943
Now is the winter
of our discontent

05:35.944 --> 05:39.877
made glorious summer
by an uptick in housing starts.

05:39.878 --> 05:41.977
Everything is beautiful, baby!

05:41.978 --> 05:43.477
The economy is in recovery!

05:43.478 --> 05:46.143
Jobs just falling out the sky.

05:46.144 --> 05:47.577
Nobody wants for anything!

05:47.578 --> 05:48.810
Another round of drinks

05:48.811 --> 05:51.977
and a shiny new Tesla
for all my friends, right?

05:51.978 --> 05:53.110
Wrong.

05:53.111 --> 05:56.343
Here's what Daddy got
to deal with.

05:56.344 --> 05:58.177
Robert Tretorn,
Free Range Foods,

05:58.178 --> 06:01.677
coming up fast
on the food megagiants.

06:01.678 --> 06:04.810
Saw the whole organic food thing
jumping off in the '70s,

06:04.811 --> 06:07.577
decided to assimilate it
into the mainstream,

06:07.578 --> 06:10.843
make it all go down easy
as a decaf organic

06:10.844 --> 06:13.543
two-pump chocolate laxative.

06:13.544 --> 06:15.377
Started with one little shop
in Boulder,

06:15.378 --> 06:18.277
grew the fucker to 1,200 stores.

06:18.278 --> 06:23.411
So I travel 6,000 fucking miles
just to pitch it!

06:27.578 --> 06:30.077
But I guess this is what owning

06:30.078 --> 06:31.877
your own joint looks like,
right?

06:31.878 --> 06:35.977
You end up chasing
every nutbucket across the earth

06:35.978 --> 06:39.277
hoping he might... just might...
hire your sorry ass.

06:39.278 --> 06:42.577
If we land this whale,
we feast on the blubber

06:42.578 --> 06:46.110
until we land the next one;
feast on that blubber,

06:46.111 --> 06:49.610
sell the ivory till we land
the next one and the next one,

06:49.611 --> 06:52.710
and so on, and so
ad in-fucking-nitum

06:52.711 --> 06:55.010
until we get some fat;

06:55.011 --> 06:56.610
acquire some
blubber of our own.

06:56.611 --> 06:59.577
But until that day,
you do what you gotta do, baby.

06:59.578 --> 07:01.878
You eat sick fish ass.

07:05.844 --> 07:08.077
Mmm-mmm!
That is amazing!

07:08.078 --> 07:09.577
Right, huh?
I told you.

07:09.578 --> 07:11.043
And I'm gonna own that market!

07:11.044 --> 07:12.277
Oh, yes, you are.

07:12.278 --> 07:14.343
And you're gonna teach
the world to love it.

07:14.344 --> 07:15.443
That's right.
That's right.

07:15.444 --> 07:16.843
That is exactly
what I'm gonna do.

07:16.844 --> 07:18.310
Yeah. I mean, if...

07:18.311 --> 07:20.110
If-if what?

07:20.111 --> 07:22.310
What?
Well,

07:22.311 --> 07:25.577
look, you want to crush that
behemoth Colossal Foods, right?

07:25.578 --> 07:27.843
I mean, unless you're happy

07:27.844 --> 07:30.043
in your little faux,
dead-end hippie niche market.

07:30.044 --> 07:31.343
No judgment.

07:31.344 --> 07:33.243
Well, what are you saying, huh?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.278
You saying that, uh, Free Range
is plateauing?

07:37.111 --> 07:41.343
Hey, I do show your last three
quarterlies dangerously flat.

07:41.344 --> 07:42.777
Well, that's 'cause
the economy...

07:42.778 --> 07:44.377
Flat is death in this economy.

07:44.378 --> 07:46.777
Flat is death in
this economy, Robert.

07:46.778 --> 07:48.977
Bobby...

07:48.978 --> 07:52.710
Fuck it! Look, do you want to
be fucking 'roid rage huge?

07:52.711 --> 07:54.843
I have a 20-year
expansion rollout plan

07:54.844 --> 07:56.377
that I'm very happy with.

07:56.378 --> 07:58.210
Robert, 20 years?
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.443
The polar ice caps
will have melted in 20 years.

08:00.444 --> 08:02.177
We'll all be dead
in fucking 20 years.

08:02.178 --> 08:04.543
We'll be drowning in
our last million barrels of crude oil.

08:04.544 --> 08:06.243
These assholes
aren't gonna live through the week.

08:06.244 --> 08:07.877
What are you
willing to do today?

08:07.878 --> 08:09.877
Not in 20 years, man.

08:09.878 --> 08:11.977
How are you gonna
carpe de fucking diem today?

08:11.978 --> 08:12.910
Today!

08:12.911 --> 08:14.910
To-fucking-day!
Today.

08:14.911 --> 08:15.977
All right! Huh?
How about it, huh?

08:15.978 --> 08:17.543
Bing! Bong!
Seaweed! Oh!

08:17.544 --> 08:20.744
Oh! Oh, my God! I thought
I'd completely lost you.

08:23.144 --> 08:25.244
Oh, that's not bad.

08:28.344 --> 08:30.710
Anyone get, uh, tickets
to Days of Hope?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.577
"Anyone, duh, get tickets
to Days of Hope?"

08:32.578 --> 08:33.777
What do you think?

08:33.778 --> 08:35.342
Of course not. It's
been sold out forever.

08:35.344 --> 08:36.977
I know everybody talks about it
all the time,

08:36.977 --> 08:40.243
and I know everybody really wants to
go, but what is the actual charity?

08:40.244 --> 08:42.577
What exactly are
they raising money for?

08:42.578 --> 08:44.377
I have no idea.
I don't know.

08:44.378 --> 08:46.477
Who cares?
Not me.

08:46.478 --> 08:50.377
Word on the street is that the
CEO of Coke is firing DeMark,

08:50.378 --> 08:52.477
and everyone wants to go suck up
and get the gig.

08:52.478 --> 08:54.043
"Word on the street"?

08:54.044 --> 08:55.244
Which one, Sesame Street?

08:58.011 --> 08:59.777
Sesame Street...

08:59.778 --> 09:02.243
Mmm, I normally hate those
fucking things, but I did scam

09:02.244 --> 09:03.477
the one Galweather ticket.

09:03.478 --> 09:04.643
Really?

09:04.644 --> 09:06.543
Uh... hey, could I be
your plus-one?

09:06.544 --> 09:07.910
I don't get a plus-one.

09:07.911 --> 09:09.810
Oh...
But let me be clear:

09:09.811 --> 09:12.011
if I did get a plus-one,
it would not be you.

09:13.011 --> 09:13.977
You're funny.

09:13.978 --> 09:15.210
She's funny.

09:15.211 --> 09:16.643
Hey,

09:16.644 --> 09:18.343
do you think Marty's
gonna be there?

09:18.344 --> 09:20.043
It's very possible, Doug.
Okay, okay.

09:20.044 --> 09:21.943
Well, not saying anything...

09:21.944 --> 09:23.310
It just seems a bit cynical,
that's all.

09:23.311 --> 09:26.177
Vying to get invited
to a charity event

09:26.178 --> 09:28.277
without knowing or caring
who the money is going to...

09:28.278 --> 09:31.143
Well, hey, Benita, what
would you say if I told you

09:31.144 --> 09:32.543
I might be able
to get you a ticket?

09:32.544 --> 09:33.810
Oh, really?
No.

09:33.811 --> 09:34.710
You see, that's my point.

09:34.711 --> 09:37.277
If you had a ticket, you'd
show up at a Hitler charity.

09:37.278 --> 09:39.377
That's mean, Doug.
Well...

09:39.378 --> 09:41.778
And you know I'm anti-Hitler.

09:44.511 --> 09:46.010
I can't stand it.
I just

09:46.011 --> 09:47.843
can't stand it.
What is it now, Doug?

09:47.844 --> 09:49.043
What do you think?

09:49.044 --> 09:50.810
I have... honestly, I...
That.

09:50.811 --> 09:51.943
Her.

09:51.944 --> 09:53.277
Jack Skellington.

09:53.278 --> 09:54.277
Benita.

09:54.278 --> 09:55.577
She is driving me crazy.

09:55.578 --> 09:56.610
She's hideous.

09:56.611 --> 09:57.943
What do you want
me to say, Doug?

09:57.944 --> 09:59.510
I mean, she's a great analyst.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.310
I'm... sorry that she doesn't
fit your arousal template.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.443
You know, I used to look over
and-and be...

10:05.444 --> 10:08.043
I don't know, inspired by your

10:08.044 --> 10:09.843
generic Midwestern hotness.

10:09.844 --> 10:11.911
It's true, but now...

10:13.344 --> 10:15.877
Oh, God, now I look over
at your old desk

10:15.878 --> 10:17.810
and I see that...

10:17.811 --> 10:19.243
that Sasquatch.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.077
And...

10:21.078 --> 10:22.610
I feel sick, physically sick.

10:22.611 --> 10:24.943
I can't work, my regression
models are going to hell.

10:24.944 --> 10:27.477
Judge not lest ye be judged, Doug.

10:27.478 --> 10:29.110
Christ.
Seriously, JC?

10:29.111 --> 10:31.443
If you quote one more piece
of Bible porn at me,

10:31.444 --> 10:32.710
I...
Doug, drop it.

10:32.711 --> 10:34.143
JC, stop staring at my ass.

10:34.144 --> 10:35.510
I wasn't.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.443
I'm not.

10:36.444 --> 10:38.143
Yeah, yeah, right, okay.

10:38.144 --> 10:39.677
Or did you forget,
Jeannie, that, uh, JC doesn't like girls.

10:39.678 --> 10:40.943
What? I like girls.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.410
Oh, yeah, you just don't
like to have sex with them.

10:42.411 --> 10:43.410
By choice.

10:43.411 --> 10:45.410
My girlfriend and I are
waiting until marriage.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.410
We... made a chastity vow.

10:47.411 --> 10:48.543
How convenient.

10:48.544 --> 10:49.743
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:49.744 --> 10:51.743
You-you don't have any...
genital contact

10:51.744 --> 10:53.143
whatsoever?

10:53.144 --> 10:54.310
Not even when you're alone?

10:54.311 --> 10:56.077
- You don't, you know...
- Whoops.

10:56.078 --> 10:57.843
Well, you have to answer now.

10:57.844 --> 10:58.810
She's your boss.

10:58.811 --> 11:00.677
And remember...

11:00.678 --> 11:02.778
He's listening.

11:05.778 --> 11:07.110
Sometimes. I...

11:07.111 --> 11:08.177
Your call is starting.

11:08.178 --> 11:09.078
Thank God.

11:11.111 --> 11:13.243
I mean...
"your call is starting"?

11:13.244 --> 11:14.510
I'm sorry, Jeannie,

11:14.511 --> 11:15.643
I am, I'm sorry,

11:15.644 --> 11:16.977
I just miss the old
gang, that's all.

11:16.978 --> 11:18.943
Doug, please.
I can't help it.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.110
I mean, do you ever think

11:20.111 --> 11:21.343
Marty talks about me
to his new pod?

11:21.344 --> 11:22.710
Nope.

11:22.711 --> 11:23.877
"Nope."
See, that's what I'm talking about.

11:23.878 --> 11:25.810
That back and forth,
the good old days.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.577
Do you remember how fun it was?

11:27.578 --> 11:29.143
Clyde and me goofing around.

11:29.144 --> 11:30.777
Marty always telling
me to, you know, "Shut the fuck up."

11:30.778 --> 11:32.443
Shut the fuck up, Doug.
Exactly.

11:32.444 --> 11:33.443
And you and Marty?

11:33.444 --> 11:34.443
God, remember that?

11:34.444 --> 11:35.710
How confused and tortured

11:35.711 --> 11:37.910
and out of control
that whole thing was?

11:37.911 --> 11:40.477
Probably not so fun
for you, but, uh...

11:40.478 --> 11:41.478
Yeah, for me...

11:42.511 --> 11:43.978
Yeah, we're both busy, so...

11:47.178 --> 11:48.143
Hey.

11:48.144 --> 11:50.377
Seems like a long way to go

11:50.378 --> 11:51.677
for a mid-sized
grocery chain.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.443
Maybe that's what working
for a startup is:

11:54.444 --> 11:55.743
running halfway
across the world

11:55.744 --> 11:57.177
for a new account.

11:57.178 --> 11:59.210
I really can't tell
if our company's a huge success

11:59.211 --> 12:00.610
or about to go under.

12:00.611 --> 12:02.277
I thought working for Marty Kaan

12:02.278 --> 12:03.777
would be way more glamorous.

12:03.778 --> 12:04.977
Hmm?

12:04.978 --> 12:06.743
Because I really,

12:06.744 --> 12:08.377
really, really need
to find someone

12:08.378 --> 12:09.543
who's willing to date me.

12:09.544 --> 12:11.177
Okay, well, for a start,

12:11.178 --> 12:13.644
that kind of desperation's
a huge turn-on.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.644
Have your sport.

12:19.978 --> 12:21.943
But Marty and his pod
have always been

12:21.944 --> 12:24.743
legend when it comes
to ladykilling.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.143
Somehow, when you say that,

12:26.144 --> 12:29.144
it actually sounds like
you are killing ladies.

12:31.511 --> 12:32.743
Yep. Well...

12:32.744 --> 12:34.777
I guess, when I came
over from Kinsley,

12:34.778 --> 12:36.510
I thought he'd have
some bigger moves, too.

12:36.511 --> 12:38.277
I mean, Monica talks about him

12:38.278 --> 12:39.810
like he's fuckin' Voldemort.

12:39.811 --> 12:42.744
I can hear every
fucking word you're saying.

12:54.711 --> 12:56.010
Oh. Hey, Dad.

12:56.011 --> 12:57.843
Hey, buddy.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.710
Can you make me a macchiato?

12:59.711 --> 13:00.877
Can I make you a what?

13:00.878 --> 13:02.143
A macchiato.
Oh.

13:02.144 --> 13:03.243
Yeah.

13:03.244 --> 13:04.310
Boop!

13:04.311 --> 13:06.177
You are a macchiato.

13:06.178 --> 13:07.477
Ha-ha.

13:07.478 --> 13:09.343
But for real, I need energy.

13:09.344 --> 13:10.577
I have basketball
tryouts today.

13:10.578 --> 13:12.510
You're trying out for
the basketball team?

13:12.511 --> 13:14.810
Splash.
Mmm...

13:14.811 --> 13:16.310
Not bad.

13:16.311 --> 13:18.210
Let's see how you do
with a little defense on you.

13:18.211 --> 13:20.377
Uh... you want...
you want it?

13:20.378 --> 13:22.010
Come on.
Roscoe Kaan, three seconds left.

13:22.011 --> 13:23.443
Three... two...

13:23.444 --> 13:24.810
fouled and won!

13:24.811 --> 13:26.210
Okay, now,

13:26.211 --> 13:28.643
do you guys ever play
with a real basketball?

13:28.644 --> 13:29.977
When you, you know, do this?

13:29.978 --> 13:31.543
You know, maybe we should
get a real basketball,

13:31.544 --> 13:34.010
and I'll show you
my suh-erious skills.

13:34.011 --> 13:35.577
And I'll take you
down, old man.

13:35.578 --> 13:37.210
Oh, you didn't
just say "old man."

13:37.211 --> 13:38.610
<i>Old</i> man.
I think what you meant is "master..."

13:38.611 --> 13:39.910
Oh.
...and you want a clinic.

13:39.911 --> 13:40.977
The clinic?
That's what I'm hearing.

13:40.978 --> 13:42.677
Let's go.
Okay, posting up his dad.

13:42.678 --> 13:43.943
Let's see it.
Uh! Fake!

13:43.944 --> 13:45.710
Dunked on you!
Uh-uh! Swatted.

13:45.711 --> 13:46.977
What?!

13:46.978 --> 13:48.243
Whoops. It's in
the second row, son.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.010
Who do you think you are? What
the hell is going on out here?

13:51.011 --> 13:52.543
Young Roscoe is trying out

13:52.544 --> 13:54.377
for the basketball team today.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.843
<i>Basketball</i> basketball?

13:56.844 --> 13:58.110
Well, all right!

13:58.111 --> 13:59.710
All right.
I'm in the game.

13:59.711 --> 14:01.910
All right. I got you.
Yeah!

14:01.911 --> 14:03.143
So how was China?

14:03.144 --> 14:04.943
Uh, you know, brief, Chinese...

14:04.944 --> 14:06.643
Hey, Dad, did you see
the Peking Opera?

14:06.644 --> 14:08.010
That makeup is fly.

14:08.011 --> 14:09.777
Nah, I was just there 24 hours,

14:09.778 --> 14:10.777
I didn't really have time to...
Oh?

14:10.778 --> 14:11.710
Take in a show or anything.

14:11.711 --> 14:13.377
24 hours for a job

14:13.378 --> 14:14.710
you don't even have yet.

14:14.711 --> 14:17.077
You got to be careful
what you ask for, huh? Yeah.

14:17.078 --> 14:17.977
Big man's off the bench.

14:17.978 --> 14:19.277
I'm not complaining.

14:19.278 --> 14:21.377
I know you miss your old pod.

14:21.378 --> 14:22.777
Nope. The new pod
is just fine.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.610
Come on. Here we go.
Pass it here! Got it.

14:24.611 --> 14:26.210
I got a mean skyhook!

14:26.211 --> 14:27.943
Skyhook?
Ooh, yeah!

14:27.944 --> 14:29.910
He has a sky...
Dad, Dad, what is this, 1974?

14:29.911 --> 14:32.410
We don't have big huge Afros

14:32.411 --> 14:33.843
and play with red,
white and blue balls.

14:33.844 --> 14:34.943
In short shorts.
Oh...

14:34.944 --> 14:37.110
Oh... what?
Lookit here,

14:37.111 --> 14:39.310
double-teaming the old man.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.743
Short shorts...

14:40.744 --> 14:42.243
Give it here.
Here, here, here, here we go.

14:42.244 --> 14:43.377
Gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha, let's go.

14:43.378 --> 14:45.077
I know it's gotta be weird

14:45.078 --> 14:46.243
traveling without Jeannie

14:46.244 --> 14:47.743
at your side, huh?
Or Clyde?

14:47.744 --> 14:49.043
Or Doug? Here.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.210
You know, Dad,

14:50.211 --> 14:51.877
I would want Jeannie
definitely by my side.

14:51.878 --> 14:54.177
Well, Jeannie's not by my side,

14:54.178 --> 14:56.110
and she's not going
to be by my side.

14:56.111 --> 14:58.143
Okay?
It's fine. I miss her, too.

14:58.144 --> 14:59.977
I didn't say that I missed...
Here.

14:59.978 --> 15:01.043
Boink!

15:01.044 --> 15:02.343
Here we go.
This is stupid.

15:02.344 --> 15:03.443
Come on.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.044
I got you, Dad.
Excuse me.

15:06.411 --> 15:07.577
Come on, Dad.

15:07.578 --> 15:08.643
That's all right.

15:08.644 --> 15:09.910
Ah, cookies!
Whoa!

15:09.911 --> 15:11.310
Oh, stole the ball!

15:11.311 --> 15:12.344
Got it, got it...

15:23.378 --> 15:24.977
Three...

15:24.978 --> 15:25.910
two...

15:25.911 --> 15:27.377
one...

15:27.378 --> 15:28.743
So...

15:28.744 --> 15:30.610
I was thinking,

15:30.611 --> 15:34.610
we have had this Montana account
for... two weeks,

15:34.611 --> 15:36.077
and if I'm not mistaken,

15:36.078 --> 15:39.110
not one of you mouth-breathers have
volunteered to quarterback it yet.

15:39.111 --> 15:39.943
Pussy much?

15:39.944 --> 15:41.543
You know what?

15:41.544 --> 15:43.377
I was born to QB.
Put me in, Coach.

15:43.378 --> 15:45.543
I thought you were a kicker.

15:45.544 --> 15:46.910
Hope you're getting
that these are sports metaphors.

15:46.911 --> 15:48.743
We're not talking about
actual football, dude.

15:48.744 --> 15:49.877
Oh, okay, good.

15:49.878 --> 15:51.518
Because I'm pretty sure
you'd get crushed.

15:52.511 --> 15:53.410
Huge football fan.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.443
Really?

15:54.444 --> 15:55.443
Me, too.

15:55.444 --> 15:56.543
Really?

15:56.544 --> 15:57.543
Please shut up.

15:57.544 --> 15:58.910
I was just...

15:58.911 --> 16:00.277
Christy, stop hanging out
outside the boys' club.

16:00.278 --> 16:01.310
Do you remember
what we talked about?

16:01.311 --> 16:03.443
Ah, I'm so sorry, Monica.

16:03.444 --> 16:05.877
Pussy power.

16:05.878 --> 16:07.110
Yeah!
I'm sorry, did you just say "pussy power"?

16:07.111 --> 16:08.243
What is that?
Yeah.

16:08.244 --> 16:09.810
I think she just said
"pussy power."

16:09.811 --> 16:11.843
Ugh.
Kicker, get it done.

16:11.844 --> 16:13.010
It's so confusing.

16:13.011 --> 16:14.877
It's like sometimes
she's my mentor,

16:14.878 --> 16:16.710
and other times I feel like

16:16.711 --> 16:18.477
she's torturing me.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.810
That is the result

16:19.811 --> 16:21.577
of a steady diet
of Dalmatian puppies.

16:21.578 --> 16:23.510
Thanks, Clyde.

16:23.511 --> 16:25.310
Listen, I'm just a guy

16:25.311 --> 16:26.577
trying to let a girl know

16:26.578 --> 16:27.811
that it's gonna be okay.

16:29.011 --> 16:30.110
Okay. Well...

16:30.111 --> 16:32.343
I got to get something working,

16:32.344 --> 16:34.743
but thank you.
Truly.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.043
- It's just the person...
- Christy!

16:37.044 --> 16:39.811
I try to be.
Yeah! Coming!

16:42.544 --> 16:43.877
Does that shit really
work for you, man?

16:43.878 --> 16:45.743
What do you think?

16:45.744 --> 16:48.543
I want to say...

16:48.544 --> 16:50.543
no.

16:50.544 --> 16:52.477
<i>All right, here's</i>
<i>your marching orders.</i>

16:52.478 --> 16:54.210
<i>Caitlin, I want this deal</i>
<i>with Free Range to make,</i>

16:54.211 --> 16:55.943
so I need you to push on legal.

16:55.944 --> 16:57.943
Got it.
Jeffrey, listen.

16:57.944 --> 17:00.310
Start, you know, roughing
in that journeyline, okay?

17:00.311 --> 17:01.877
Make it look like
we're saving them from bankruptcy.

17:01.878 --> 17:03.177
We will save them, sir.

17:03.178 --> 17:04.910
Young William.

17:04.911 --> 17:06.343
Now, when you were at Kinsley,

17:06.344 --> 17:09.242
how did Monica service
the Colossal Foods account?

17:09.243 --> 17:10.510
I don't really know.

17:10.511 --> 17:12.742
I mean, she was always
pretty secretive about her accounts.

17:12.743 --> 17:14.077
Yeah,

17:14.078 --> 17:16.710
but you must've seen
her do that old trick

17:16.711 --> 17:19.443
of recycling PowerPoints
and just, you know,

17:19.444 --> 17:20.410
changing the names.

17:20.411 --> 17:22.943
I... um...

17:22.944 --> 17:24.443
I feel like if I tell you,

17:24.444 --> 17:25.910
she'll hunt me down
and kill me.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.978
Okay.
I don't want... that.

17:30.878 --> 17:32.239
Or I could just
kill you right now.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.443
You could... here...
Or that. You-you could...

17:35.444 --> 17:36.477
So...

17:36.478 --> 17:38.743
did she do that
with Colossal Foods?

17:38.744 --> 17:41.677
Uh... she might've.

17:41.678 --> 17:43.443
Will...
Yes. She did.

17:43.444 --> 17:45.143
Anybody ever find out?

17:45.144 --> 17:47.110
Never.

17:47.111 --> 17:48.643
Never.

17:48.644 --> 17:51.043
Ooh...

17:51.044 --> 17:52.210
This is awesome.
Nice digs, right?

17:52.211 --> 17:53.177
It's-it's really nice.

17:53.178 --> 17:54.278
Get out.
Okay.

18:04.511 --> 18:06.343
Monica.

18:06.344 --> 18:08.410
<i>Don't move.</i>

18:08.411 --> 18:10.110
I'm gonna freeze this moment.
This feels right.

18:10.111 --> 18:11.943
Okay, this here is perfect.

18:11.944 --> 18:13.277
So good to see you, buddy.

18:13.278 --> 18:15.077
I missed this. I really did.

18:15.078 --> 18:16.843
Good to see you, yeah, man.
Clyde, so good to see you.

18:16.844 --> 18:18.143
Yeah.
God, I missed you. I did.

18:18.144 --> 18:20.477
Do you know what I miss, though?
The cheap espresso over here.

18:20.478 --> 18:22.677
Come on, don't do that.
It is so expensive where I am.

18:22.678 --> 18:24.343
Clyde, you can say it, you
can say you miss me, too.

18:24.344 --> 18:26.243
It's all right.
Men can say that.

18:26.244 --> 18:28.210
Men in suspenders can do that.
Men, period.

18:28.211 --> 18:30.877
All right? Men are also loving
and feeling human beings.

18:30.878 --> 18:32.510
All right?

18:32.511 --> 18:33.943
The ladies do not have
that market cornered.

18:33.944 --> 18:36.143
Speaking of women...
Jeannie, Jeannie!

18:36.144 --> 18:37.443
Be-doop-ba-dee!

18:37.444 --> 18:39.077
Look who stopped by.

18:39.078 --> 18:40.377
Hi, Clyde.

18:40.378 --> 18:42.010
Jeannie...

18:42.011 --> 18:43.877
Van Der Hooven!

18:43.878 --> 18:45.510
Stop it.
I will.

18:45.511 --> 18:46.577
This is great.

18:46.578 --> 18:48.043
This is so great...
the three of us,

18:48.044 --> 18:49.310
the old gang back together.

18:49.311 --> 18:50.643
I mean, everyone
except for, uh,

18:50.644 --> 18:52.477
He Who Shall Not Be Named.

18:52.478 --> 18:54.177
Doug.
It's good to see you, Clyde.

18:54.178 --> 18:56.377
Yeah.

18:56.378 --> 18:58.010
So, how is it over here?
It's great!

18:58.011 --> 18:59.377
You guys getting business?
Yeah, tons.

18:59.378 --> 19:00.777
You're getting work?
Tons, tons, tons, too much.

19:00.778 --> 19:01.710
I'm fucking slaying it
at Kinsley.

19:01.711 --> 19:03.010
Oh, yeah?
It's insane.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.243
It's good to finally be
at the number one firm.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.010
'Cause when you walk in
the building, you're like,

19:06.011 --> 19:07.710
Yeah, that must carry you.
"Oh, this is what number one feels like."

19:07.711 --> 19:08.743
Yeah, don't have to work
as hard? I get that.

19:08.744 --> 19:10.110
No, but that's it, though,
I don't even feel

19:10.111 --> 19:11.177
like I'm getting
challenged that much.

19:11.178 --> 19:12.943
Yeah, it sounds terrible.
No, if there were some

19:12.944 --> 19:14.943
intriguing possibilities
elsewhere

19:14.944 --> 19:17.877
at any place, honestly even...
I know it sounds stupid,

19:17.878 --> 19:19.043
but even here.

19:19.044 --> 19:20.177
Here? Oh, God, don't bother.

19:20.178 --> 19:21.418
This place sucks without Marty.

19:23.044 --> 19:24.344
And you... you, you and Marty.

19:25.578 --> 19:26.677
Is that...?

19:26.678 --> 19:27.943
Yeah, that's what I was...

19:27.944 --> 19:29.610
She was at the...

19:29.611 --> 19:32.543
Uh, you're, uh, you're kind of
in my, uh, my desk, bro.

19:32.544 --> 19:34.843
Bro?

19:34.844 --> 19:37.377
It was kind of his desk
before it was your desk.

19:37.378 --> 19:38.977
Right, but, see, now it's, uh,

19:38.978 --> 19:41.677
now it's my desk.

19:41.678 --> 19:44.477
So, is this Clyde,
whom we've heard so much about?

19:44.478 --> 19:45.977
That's whom I am.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.743
Nice to meet you, Clyde.
Nice to meet you, too.

19:47.744 --> 19:50.877
And you've got to be Benita, whom
Doug talks about constantly.

19:50.878 --> 19:52.811
So sweet.
No, not really.

19:58.944 --> 20:01.110
Can I get my desk back?

20:01.111 --> 20:02.777
I don't even care, maybe
you guys can help me

20:02.778 --> 20:05.477
understand better how this
big a fuck-up happened!

20:05.478 --> 20:07.377
I don't, I don't know
because I'm-I'm back there

20:07.378 --> 20:09.243
doing what I'm
supposed to be doing!

20:09.244 --> 20:10.777
What the fuck are
you guys doing?!

20:10.778 --> 20:13.010
Don't just stare back
at me like roadkill.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.043
Let's get in the solution.

20:15.044 --> 20:16.778
Right? Now!

20:19.844 --> 20:21.010
Hi!

20:21.011 --> 20:22.377
I'm so glad you were able

20:22.378 --> 20:23.343
to make it back to work.

20:23.344 --> 20:24.277
You look rested.

20:24.278 --> 20:25.743
Thank you so much.

20:25.744 --> 20:28.210
So, let me catch you up to
speed since you've been gone

20:28.211 --> 20:29.343
for the past three hours?

20:29.344 --> 20:30.310
I was gone for, like, two...

20:30.311 --> 20:31.610
Seems that Colossal Foods,

20:31.611 --> 20:32.810
those old douche bags,

20:32.811 --> 20:35.243
have called me
into a meeting in Phoenix.

20:35.244 --> 20:36.843
"That's weird,"
I say to myself.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.177
So I do
a little back-channel digging.

20:38.178 --> 20:40.910
Turns out that there is a
nasty rumor floating around

20:40.911 --> 20:42.643
that I have given them
bogus numbers.

20:42.644 --> 20:45.344
That I've repurposed
PowerPoints.

20:46.978 --> 20:48.843
But you-you brag
about doing that.

20:48.844 --> 20:49.843
That's not the point.

20:49.844 --> 20:51.610
That's not the...? Oh.
The point is,

20:51.611 --> 20:53.610
we could be counseled out.

20:53.611 --> 20:56.043
And by the way,
everybody does it.

20:56.044 --> 20:57.743
Well, you're the first one
I've ever heard of.

20:57.744 --> 20:59.443
Aw, Everett, you big idiot.

20:59.444 --> 21:01.278
I think...

21:04.511 --> 21:06.877
Oh.

21:06.878 --> 21:08.943
I think you told them.

21:08.944 --> 21:10.077
I definitely didn't tell them.
Mm-hmm.

21:10.078 --> 21:11.077
Why would I tell them?

21:11.078 --> 21:12.477
I didn't even know.

21:12.478 --> 21:15.210
Stop making your stupidity
sound like a virtue, sweetie.

21:15.211 --> 21:16.577
Monica...

21:16.578 --> 21:19.543
If you could just use
the tits and ass

21:19.544 --> 21:21.010
that God gave you

21:21.011 --> 21:23.877
and blow the occasional CEO,

21:23.878 --> 21:25.377
maybe, just maybe,
we wouldn't be

21:25.378 --> 21:26.577
in the fuckhole

21:26.578 --> 21:28.278
that we are in right now!

21:30.611 --> 21:34.343
I want ten

21:34.344 --> 21:36.843
of the best ideas

21:36.844 --> 21:38.978
to save this account by tonight.

21:40.878 --> 21:43.610
Now, if you'll excuse me.

21:43.611 --> 21:46.543
I have to go
to the Days of Fucking Hope

21:46.544 --> 21:49.343
to save sick kids.

21:49.344 --> 21:51.343
Or animals.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.778
Or genocide.

21:55.644 --> 21:57.043
That happened.

21:57.044 --> 21:58.277
Hey, you all right?

21:58.278 --> 21:59.677
Don't touch me!

21:59.678 --> 22:00.943
Oh, my God, are you...?

22:00.944 --> 22:02.577
Don't touch me, Clyde,

22:02.578 --> 22:04.443
or I will call HR right now

22:04.444 --> 22:05.510
and I will bury you.

22:05.511 --> 22:07.977
Okay, okay.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.710
Did she say something to you?
Is that what this is?

22:09.711 --> 22:10.977
'Cause she does it all the time.

22:10.978 --> 22:11.943
She tries to pit us
against each other.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.177
It's like a sport to her.

22:13.178 --> 22:14.410
She likes to see us
fucking fight and go nuts.

22:14.411 --> 22:15.410
That's exactly

22:15.411 --> 22:16.410
what she said you'd say.

22:16.411 --> 22:18.343
Oh, it's exactly
what Monica said?

22:18.344 --> 22:20.543
Yeah, "Monica said," Clyde.

22:20.544 --> 22:22.610
We talk, we share things.

22:22.611 --> 22:25.177
She thinks that I
am a-a rising star.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.310
She just asked you
to blow a CEO.

22:27.311 --> 22:29.410
I'm not gonna have
this conversation

22:29.411 --> 22:30.643
with a rapist.

22:30.644 --> 22:33.443
Uh... who's a rapist?

22:33.444 --> 22:35.043
You are.

22:35.044 --> 22:37.077
Or "alleged."

22:37.078 --> 22:38.510
Rape accusations are
like quicksand.

22:38.511 --> 22:40.443
The more you fight,
the worse they get you.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.777
Everett, shut the fuck up!
I'm not a rapist.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.577
You know,
you know that I'm not a rapist.

22:44.578 --> 22:46.977
Just 'cause you were acquitted
doesn't make you innocent.

22:46.978 --> 22:49.643
Oh, okay, so I was acquitted?
Were you?

22:49.644 --> 22:50.977
No! How can you be acquitted
when you've never done...?

22:50.978 --> 22:52.043
Don't pick up the phone!
All right, I'm calling...

22:52.044 --> 22:53.177
Christy, look at me!
Don't-don't touch me!

22:53.178 --> 22:54.377
Oh, my God.

22:54.378 --> 22:56.877
Is there some way that you can help
me understand the fucking stupidity

22:56.878 --> 22:58.943
of the human race?
Maybe there's an app for that?!

22:58.944 --> 23:01.043
Is there some kind of a pie chart we
can refer to Christy, put down the phone.

23:01.044 --> 23:03.110
That can explain to me
the way you fucking think?!

23:03.111 --> 23:04.243
Put the... Oh, my God!

23:04.244 --> 23:05.643
Is that possible?!

23:05.644 --> 23:06.977
Is there something
that I could look at

23:06.978 --> 23:09.911
where it could make some
fucking sense to me?!

23:37.144 --> 23:40.077
Oh, my, you're moonlighting

23:40.078 --> 23:41.177
as a limo driver.

23:41.178 --> 23:42.177
You look nice.

23:42.178 --> 23:43.877
I look nice.

23:43.878 --> 23:45.643
But I'm not nice.

23:45.644 --> 23:47.611
Me neither.

23:49.778 --> 23:52.177
Now, I figured you'd be going
to this Days of Hope dinner.

23:52.178 --> 23:55.077
I thought maybe
you'd like a ride?

23:55.078 --> 23:56.711
What do you want, Marty?

23:58.244 --> 24:00.178
We miss you at the new shop.

24:02.578 --> 24:03.777
And there's still
a place there for you.

24:03.778 --> 24:05.177
I mean, I don't know

24:05.178 --> 24:07.510
if any of that matters...
That's right.

24:07.511 --> 24:10.043
I-I-I brought you a peace offering, Jeannie.
Marty?

24:10.044 --> 24:12.743
I would love to
stay and listen.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.843
But I want to get
to the CEO of Coke

24:14.844 --> 24:16.177
before anyone else does.

24:16.178 --> 24:18.510
See, I have a plan.

24:18.511 --> 24:21.177
Most people have a few drinks

24:21.178 --> 24:23.143
and they wait till they have
enough liquid courage

24:23.144 --> 24:24.843
to make a move,
typically after dinner.

24:24.844 --> 24:26.310
But I, being smart

24:26.311 --> 24:28.277
and calculating,

24:28.278 --> 24:30.877
got a little shitfaced
all alone in my kitchen.

24:30.878 --> 24:32.110
Wow.

24:32.111 --> 24:34.843
I think you were going for clever,
but that came off as really sad.

24:34.844 --> 24:36.710
Whatever, Marty.
I'll see you around.

24:36.711 --> 24:39.310
Oh, God, I thought
I taught you better than that.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.810
Jea... You are running around
on the same shitty information

24:42.811 --> 24:44.643
as all those other
dipshits out there.

24:44.644 --> 24:48.010
The CEO of Coke threatens

24:48.011 --> 24:49.877
to fire DeMark
every three years.

24:49.878 --> 24:51.210
But he's never gonna do it.

24:51.211 --> 24:53.543
Because the account manager is

24:53.544 --> 24:55.410
his brother-in-law.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.377
But, by all means,

24:57.378 --> 24:59.110
go ahead.

24:59.111 --> 25:00.943
I hear they serve
an amazing rubber chicken.

25:00.944 --> 25:02.010
And drunk driving, Jeannie?

25:02.011 --> 25:03.944
That's super smart.

25:06.644 --> 25:08.543
You know your shit, Marty.

25:08.544 --> 25:10.543
What do you got? What?

25:10.544 --> 25:11.744
Colossal Foods.

25:13.078 --> 25:14.910
Go on.

25:14.911 --> 25:17.177
They're wide open.

25:17.178 --> 25:18.777
Yours.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.577
I'll give you everything
you need to close them.

25:20.578 --> 25:22.577
That's a big account.

25:22.578 --> 25:24.910
Why are you not taking them?

25:24.911 --> 25:26.277
Daddy just closed Free Range.

25:26.278 --> 25:27.443
That's a conflict of interest.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.010
And why are you
giving them to me?

25:29.011 --> 25:30.743
How drunk are you?

25:30.744 --> 25:32.510
You take Colossal Foods,
I take Free Range.

25:32.511 --> 25:34.443
We share a little intel.

25:34.444 --> 25:35.843
Play both companies

25:35.844 --> 25:37.743
against the middle,
keep them on the hook.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.577
Forever.

25:39.578 --> 25:40.677
Ooh.

25:40.678 --> 25:42.310
That is...

25:42.311 --> 25:44.577
so illegal.

25:44.578 --> 25:45.577
No.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.544
Not the way we're gonna do it.

25:52.344 --> 25:55.077
This doesn't change
anything, though, Marty.

25:55.078 --> 25:57.410
That's... it's...
I'm not getting... Right.

25:57.411 --> 25:59.910
That's completely over, Marty.

25:59.911 --> 26:01.877
This, us, we're not...

26:01.878 --> 26:03.543
Okay, listen, listen.
Okay? I'm not getting...

26:03.544 --> 26:05.643
I will give you a ride
to Days of Hope.

26:05.644 --> 26:08.643
If you are not fully on board
by the time we get there,

26:08.644 --> 26:10.510
I'll just, you know, kill you

26:10.511 --> 26:12.611
and throw your dead carcass
in the trunk.

26:14.078 --> 26:16.611
That's very sweet.
