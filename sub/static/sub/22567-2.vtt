<i>That was Chopin's
"Minute Waltz".</i>

00:32.860 --> 00:35.380
<i>Lasts about as long
as a Middle-Eastern ceasefire.</i>

00:35.820 --> 00:37.940
<i>The time now is 12:30 p.m.,</i>

00:38.020 --> 00:39.900
<i>and also time for one of my favorites:</i>

00:39.980 --> 00:42.060
<i>Verdi's "La Traviata".</i>

Dr Iain Glennis speaking?

00:45.900 --> 00:47.140
You need to come here now.

00:47.460 --> 00:50.100
Hello, Daniel.
Sorry, uh, I can't. It's my day off.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.620
Fuck your day off!
Something terrible has happened.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.380
Calm... Calm down.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.180
- Can you give me a couple of hours?
- No! Now!

00:57.260 --> 00:59.580
Someone found out about our secret,
and now they're dead.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.420
So, you can either stay there
and enjoy your last day as a free man,

01:03.500 --> 01:05.820
or you can come here
and help me fix this situation

01:05.900 --> 01:06.980
that could fuck us both.

01:07.060 --> 01:10.740
I'm on my way but...
but please stop swearing at me.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.380

01:28.780 --> 01:30.980
- He was making love to your girlfriend?
- Yes!

01:31.540 --> 01:33.660
- He tried to escape out the window.
- You pushed him?

01:33.740 --> 01:37.900
- No! He fell! I didn't touch him.
- Yeah, yeah. He... He fell. He just fell.

01:38.420 --> 01:39.500
Yes, he fell.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.860
I can't find his pulse.
He's not breathing.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.500
Yeah, vital signs
can often elude the layman.

01:44.860 --> 01:45.860
Have you moved him?

01:46.220 --> 01:49.180
No, he fell holding a newspaper
and landed in that chair.

01:49.260 --> 01:50.580
Of course I moved him!

01:50.660 --> 01:52.700
You're not supposed
to move someone after a fall,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.300
you can make their injuries worse.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.980
I imagine there'll be a lot
of cranial bruising and bleeding.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.500
- He's dead.
- Oh, fuck!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.660
- I'm sorry.
- What do we do? Take him to the hospital?

02:05.740 --> 02:07.500
Only if you want
to go to prison for murder.

02:07.580 --> 02:10.300
- Murder?! I told you, he slipped.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.340
You discover your best friend
having an affair with your girlfriend

02:13.420 --> 02:16.100
and he suddenly takes
a mysterious fall from your window.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.260
He did slip.

02:18.140 --> 02:20.860
- We need to move this.
- Yes, yes. Understood.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.060
But I just want to make it
crystal clear... this body...

02:23.140 --> 02:23.940
Shhh!

02:24.020 --> 02:25.020
This...

02:25.220 --> 02:27.740
This body has got
nothing to do with me, OK?

02:27.820 --> 02:30.020
Remember when
you misdiagnosed me with cancer?

02:30.700 --> 02:31.700
You owe me one.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.580
Fine. Fine. Um...

02:35.100 --> 02:36.820
We can dump his body on a quiet road

02:36.900 --> 02:38.500
and make it look like
he's been run over.

02:39.060 --> 02:40.500
But instead of stopping,

02:40.580 --> 02:43.460
the driver has decided
to simply drive away.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.700
- You mean a hit-and-run.
- Yeah, or we could try that.

02:46.180 --> 02:48.540
I saw a villain do it once
in an episode of <i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

02:48.620 --> 02:49.700
Did they get away with it?

02:49.780 --> 02:52.060
- Oh, no. No, they went to prison.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.300
They went to prison
because they didn't have an alibi.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.140
So... So, I just pretend
I've been in work all day.

02:57.780 --> 03:00.060
Oh, I see.

03:00.140 --> 03:02.660
Right, so, you go back to work
and sit behind your desk

03:02.740 --> 03:05.780
while muggins here
dumps a body on a quiet road.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.540
- That's pretty much it.
- Right, OK.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.860
It was my day off today.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.980
We need to cover the body
and we'll take it to my car.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.300
Oh, brilliant.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.620
Your friend's big-boned, isn't he?

03:36.700 --> 03:38.900
The blanket is to hide
the fact we're carrying a body.

03:38.980 --> 03:40.140
Sorry. This is me.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.820
Sorry.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.300
- Right...
- Open the boot!

03:43.860 --> 03:45.700
- What are you doing?
- I'm always losing them.

03:45.780 --> 03:47.260
You must have them, you drove it here!

03:50.140 --> 03:52.300
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's ever so temperamental.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.140
I'll pull it while you press.

03:54.220 --> 03:55.700
One, two, three.

03:55.780 --> 03:56.940
One, two...

03:57.020 --> 03:58.380
We'll go in through the back seat.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.540
Yes!

04:08.860 --> 04:10.460
"I'm so fucking wet."

04:10.540 --> 04:12.300
It's been raining. Just get a towel, then.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.820
- But please stop swearing.
- It's a message.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.740
It's from Becca to Ash, it's his phone.

04:18.180 --> 04:21.420
Oh, right. Your girlfriend's been
sending rude messages to your friend?

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
Yes!

04:23.340 --> 04:26.700
- They're sending each other pictures, too.
- Oh, really? What... What of?

04:28.340 --> 04:29.340
Never mind.

04:29.740 --> 04:32.060
Well, you're going to have
to send a message back, so...

04:32.500 --> 04:33.700
she thinks he's still alive.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.100
Oh, for...

04:36.300 --> 04:38.500
You're right. Well, what do I put?

04:38.580 --> 04:40.020
Oh, I don't know, um...

04:40.580 --> 04:41.940
Compliment her on her bottom.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.900
Right. Dump this by the body.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.900
No...

04:50.340 --> 04:51.700
Call me from it just before you do.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.100
And if anyone asks, I can say
I spoke to him and he seemed fine.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.620
- OK.
- Yeah, the code is 2-0-1-9.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.300
You know your best friend's code?

04:59.380 --> 05:01.300
We have the same one, it's <i>Blade Runner.</i>

05:01.380 --> 05:03.340
2019 is the year it's set.

05:04.180 --> 05:06.660
I don't know what <i>Blade Runner</i> is.
I might forget it.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.860
- I'll make it the same as yours.
- I don't have one.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.220
I kept getting locked out.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.980
OK, I'll make it 1-2-3-4.
Think you can remember that?

05:14.660 --> 05:15.660
1-<i>2</i>-3-4?

05:16.540 --> 05:17.820
- Yeah.
- OK, I'm going to go now.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.580
Don't f... mess it up.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.380
OK, OK.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.780
Uh, remember when you get back
to work... everything is fine and dandy.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.700
Uh, apart from the fact you have cancer.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.460
Excuse me? Hello? Hello?

05:35.540 --> 05:36.860
We'd like to eat some food.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.420
- Certainly, sir.
- I'd like the...

05:38.500 --> 05:40.820
Bring us a dozen oysters to start,

05:40.900 --> 05:43.780
and then let's have the Wagyu beef...
how do you like your meat cooked?

05:43.860 --> 05:46.180
- I don't really eat meat...
- She'll have hers medium.

05:46.260 --> 05:49.100
I'll have mine blue and bloody.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.820
Now do you think you can handle that?

05:50.900 --> 05:52.300
Yes, certainly.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.140
Fucking waiters.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.220
It goes rapists, pedophiles,
vegans, Democrats,

05:57.300 --> 05:59.500
the shit on the sole on my shoe,

05:59.580 --> 06:00.780
and then fucking waiters.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.060
Loads of the <i>Made in Chelsea</i> people
come here.

06:04.140 --> 06:05.180
Oh, I love that show.

06:05.260 --> 06:08.940
A bunch of pretty, rich people,
all fucking each other.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.140
- Yeah...
- Genius.

06:11.220 --> 06:14.220
So, anyway, I know
the Stress Thumbs weren't...

06:14.300 --> 06:18.740
You know, that's all they really do,
is they just fuck each other all the time.

06:19.220 --> 06:21.580
Then they fuck each other
behind each other's backs,

06:21.660 --> 06:24.060
and then they get caught fucking
each other... it's fabulous.

06:24.140 --> 06:25.620
Right.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.620
So, you know when you're in the shower...

06:27.700 --> 06:30.820
And they fuck in the shower.
I love fucking in the shower.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.180
- So, when you wash yourself...
- Mm...

06:34.260 --> 06:36.380
- ...the shower gel's all cold, right?
- Mm.

06:36.460 --> 06:39.940
That's why I've invented
the Shower Gel Warmer.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.140
What?

06:42.220 --> 06:44.940
It's a cozy for your shower gel,
it makes it warm.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.180
Love it!

06:48.260 --> 06:51.620
You know, my shower gel
is always freezing ass.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.780
- Really? Oh, wow.
- Yes.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.620
I've already knitted the prototype.

06:57.700 --> 07:02.380
It would be lovely if you gave me
a personal demonstration in my shower.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.460
Tonight would be good.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.540
What?

07:06.620 --> 07:10.140
I can't shower in front of my boss,
I'd be embarrassed.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.820
Mother... fuckers!

07:15.260 --> 07:16.420
Uh... Hmm...

07:17.020 --> 07:18.980
Where can I dump him? Dump him?

07:32.380 --> 07:33.860
Oh, we were best friends.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.500
- I'm calling the police.
- What? Why?

07:37.580 --> 07:40.220
To escort you from the premises
for lying to your boss.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.340
That was a joke.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.420
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.860
- Why did you say "the police"?
- I thought it would be funny.

07:45.940 --> 07:47.260
I'm sorry. It didn't land.

07:47.340 --> 07:48.340
I'm sorry.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.660
Oh... I see.

07:50.740 --> 07:53.700
Well, the Post-It Note said you'd gone
and you weren't at your desk, so...

07:53.780 --> 07:56.300
No, I've been in the toilets
for the past few hours, um...

07:56.380 --> 08:00.140
I was planning on going home
but then the sickness passed.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.420
Yeah, sure. Listen, I understand.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.020
Do you need to be here?

08:04.100 --> 08:05.500
Oh, definitely. Yeah.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.380
No, no. Yeah, no,
it's taken my mind off it.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.940
<i>You have one new message.</i>

08:17.020 --> 08:19.540
<i>Hey, baby,
I saw the clip online. I hope you're OK.</i>

08:19.900 --> 08:21.060
<i>I'm thinking about you.</i>

08:21.940 --> 08:23.980
<i>To listen again, press one...</i>

08:27.100 --> 08:30.820
<i>Caring for the sick
is what We Cover is all about.</i>

08:33.220 --> 08:34.620
Oh, shit.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.539
<i>You fucking asshole!</i>

08:36.620 --> 08:38.340
What the fuck?!
I thought you said

08:38.419 --> 08:40.940
they were going to hold this,
they were never going to show it.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.500
Get him the fuck in here!

08:42.860 --> 08:43.860
Daniel?

08:44.260 --> 08:45.820
Pop in for a quick word?

08:58.025 --> 08:59.585
- 07 700...
- Why...

09:00.265 --> 09:04.505
are you using my juicing
ingredients for your shit paintings?

09:04.585 --> 09:06.425
<i>Oh. You're not meant to see it yet.</i>

09:06.505 --> 09:08.145
It's meant to be a surprise, darling.

09:08.225 --> 09:11.505
Yeah, well, you can surprise
the people at the health food shop,

09:11.585 --> 09:12.785
by buying some replacements.

09:12.865 --> 09:15.425
That might be a tad tricky, darling,
in the middle of something.

09:15.505 --> 09:18.105
Do you remember what happened
after dinner with the Corbetts?

09:18.545 --> 09:19.545
Of course I do.

09:20.105 --> 09:23.825
- Um, I'll... I'll be as quick as I can.
- <i>I'll text you a list.</i>

09:23.905 --> 09:26.305
Just try not to lose your phone
before you get to the shop.

09:26.385 --> 09:28.265
I won't, darling. Annette, I love...

09:31.105 --> 09:32.545
Annette?

09:35.425 --> 09:37.425
Everything all right, Mr. West?

09:40.105 --> 09:45.105
- You bastard!
- OK, can we just please calm down? OK?

09:45.185 --> 09:48.945
Now, Kenny, Daniel is obviously
unaware as to what's happened

09:49.025 --> 09:51.785
because he's been in the toilet
all morning, being sick.

09:51.865 --> 09:52.945
Well, that's funny.

09:53.025 --> 09:56.465
Because, for the last 30 minutes,
I've been forwarded these clips

09:56.545 --> 09:58.345
of him being sick <i>on me.</i>

09:58.425 --> 10:01.145
I thought they said they weren't
going to release that footage.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.665
Yeah, well, some asshole did.

10:03.225 --> 10:05.785
- And a health boss getting puked on?
- Well...

10:06.585 --> 10:09.145
...the irony isn't lost on me.

10:09.225 --> 10:13.105
I am so sorry, Mr. West,
you know, I mean...

10:13.185 --> 10:17.225
I mean, this is as embarrassing
for me as it is for you.

10:17.305 --> 10:21.025
Kenny! Now, I've just received a message
from my contact at BBC News.

10:21.105 --> 10:23.545
Now, they had no idea
that Daniel has cancer!

10:23.625 --> 10:24.905
Daniel has cancer.

10:24.985 --> 10:26.825
And they want to do a follow-up piece,

10:26.905 --> 10:29.265
like a human-interest story.

10:29.985 --> 10:32.785
Now, that's everyone sharing a clip

10:32.865 --> 10:35.185
that will promote We Cover.

11:06.105 --> 11:07.785
Be careful around my... my car, will you?

11:12.545 --> 11:14.705
- Tropical, eh? Fun.
- Yeah.

11:18.305 --> 11:21.825
Ooh... If you spend over £30,
you can get a free carob bar.

11:21.905 --> 11:22.945
Uh, no, thanks.

11:23.705 --> 11:26.945
It's a great chocolate substitute
and it'll help keep those pounds off.

11:27.025 --> 11:28.305
Uh...

11:31.705 --> 11:33.105
Stay away from my car.

11:34.265 --> 11:35.505
Would you like any cashback?

11:36.105 --> 11:37.105
Sir?

11:40.065 --> 11:42.985
You just get back in here, right now!

11:43.065 --> 11:44.905
Little fucking hooligans!

11:58.425 --> 11:59.505
Oh, shit.

12:03.745 --> 12:05.905
Hi, Vanessa. How's it going?

12:07.665 --> 12:08.945
Have I spoken to Ash?

12:09.025 --> 12:11.865
Uh, yeah. He's my best mate.

12:11.945 --> 12:14.385
It would be a bit weird
if I'd never spoken to him.

12:16.385 --> 12:17.385
Sorry.

12:18.065 --> 12:20.345
Yeah. No, no, I spoke to him at lunch.

12:20.825 --> 12:21.985
Yeah, I'm at work.

12:22.665 --> 12:25.785
Yeah, it sounded like he was walking
along a busy road?

12:26.505 --> 12:28.625
Not sure if that rings any bells with you.

12:29.865 --> 12:32.745
Sure. Yeah, yeah. If I...
If I hear from him, I'll call you.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.785
OK. See... See you both soon.

12:36.385 --> 12:37.745
All right. Bye!

12:39.025 --> 12:40.545
Fuck.

12:42.385 --> 12:43.425
Hey...

12:44.145 --> 12:46.225
My dad had days
where he couldn't face anything.

12:46.505 --> 12:47.505
Just go home.

12:47.865 --> 12:50.745
Remember, you can do
whatever you like. Hm?

12:50.825 --> 12:53.945
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

12:54.025 --> 12:55.025
You bet I am.

12:55.385 --> 12:57.065
You could get away with anything.

12:57.145 --> 12:59.545
Speeding, robbing a bank...

12:59.625 --> 13:02.025
Oh! Even murder.

13:16.185 --> 13:17.665
Oh, for Pete's sake!

13:18.465 --> 13:20.425
I wasn't over the speed limit,
was I, Officer?

13:20.505 --> 13:22.345
No, sir, you were driving at 6 mph.

13:22.425 --> 13:24.465
Right, so, what's the...
what's the problem?

13:24.545 --> 13:27.705
Well, just as driving too fast is
dangerous, so is driving too slow.

13:27.785 --> 13:29.265
Oh, I did not know that.

13:29.345 --> 13:32.305
- So, you're a doctor?
- Yes, indeed I am.

13:32.905 --> 13:36.945
I'm all up to date on my tax,
MOT, insurance, etc.

13:37.585 --> 13:39.425
Your rear wheel on the right side is bald.

13:39.745 --> 13:40.745
All right. Well...

13:41.345 --> 13:44.385
I will go to a garage
right this minute and...

13:44.465 --> 13:47.625
- Just replace it with your spare.
- The garage, it's five minutes away.

13:47.705 --> 13:49.865
- Look, let me help you.
- Ah...

13:49.945 --> 13:52.145
No, no, it's fine, honestly.

13:52.225 --> 13:54.425
I'm sure you have some crimes
that you need to solve.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.905
I insist. I don't want you thinking
we're all jobsworths.

13:56.985 --> 13:58.345
Pop the boot.

13:58.425 --> 13:59.985
Sir, decline the call and pop the boot.

14:00.065 --> 14:02.985
- Ah, I've connected it by mistake.
- <i>Dr Glennis? Hello?</i>

14:03.065 --> 14:05.945
<i>Sorry, Officer, I'm...
I'm terrible with mobile phones.</i>

14:06.025 --> 14:07.665
<i>Sir, put your phone away
and pop the boot.</i>

14:09.025 --> 14:11.465
Uh-oh.

14:11.865 --> 14:14.185
Let's just get your boot popped
and get you on your way.

14:14.265 --> 14:16.825
Hey... would you like a drink?

14:17.785 --> 14:19.185
Would you like some coconut water?

14:19.265 --> 14:21.185
- No, thank you.
- Or some kale?

14:21.265 --> 14:22.385
Just throw the keys to me.

14:27.145 --> 14:28.145
Nice throw.

14:36.185 --> 14:37.545
Get back here!

14:37.625 --> 14:40.505
- What happened?
- It was a hooligan. He went that way!

14:40.585 --> 14:42.225
Make sure you get
that tire changed, sir.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.065
Shit.

14:51.705 --> 14:53.545
Fuck. He's going to tell them everything.

14:54.905 --> 14:56.185
I've got to get out of here.

14:56.785 --> 14:58.545
Ah, Lanzarote!

15:00.065 --> 15:01.185
It's a shithole.

15:01.265 --> 15:04.345
But I can recommend
a terrific brothel there.

15:04.865 --> 15:06.945
Although, for £74,

15:07.025 --> 15:10.305
I think you'll be lucky to find a guy
that will let you suck <i>him</i> off.

15:10.385 --> 15:13.625
Mr. West, I don't think
I can do the interview today.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.345
I'm... I'm not really up to it,

15:15.425 --> 15:17.585
I don't think,
and I think I might even puke.

15:17.665 --> 15:19.585
So, I think I'm just going to head home.

15:19.665 --> 15:21.185
No, you're not. Come with.

15:29.265 --> 15:31.905
Oh, Lord. Um...

15:34.745 --> 15:35.745
Uh...

15:45.505 --> 15:46.665
Oh, blast.

15:47.345 --> 15:50.025
The batteries on these last
as long as a Middle-Eastern ceasefire.

15:50.985 --> 15:51.985
OK...

15:54.585 --> 15:56.905
Oh, why don't you just bog off?!

16:23.705 --> 16:25.545
Whoa, whoa, what's happening?!

16:29.705 --> 16:30.705
Come on, have a look.

16:30.785 --> 16:32.465
I'm not... I'm not comfortable with this.

16:32.545 --> 16:34.745
Open your eyes, shithead. Have a look.

16:36.025 --> 16:37.025
See?

16:40.145 --> 16:41.185
One ball.

16:42.145 --> 16:44.305
You had testicular cancer?

16:45.705 --> 16:46.705
Nobody knows.

16:47.185 --> 16:49.385
I went through the whole thing by myself.

16:49.465 --> 16:51.265
I didn't cry like a little pussy,

16:51.345 --> 16:53.945
and I ran this fucking company
at the same time.

16:54.025 --> 16:55.625
Can you put it away now, please?

16:55.705 --> 16:58.945
No, you keep looking at it because this...

16:59.025 --> 17:00.705
is why you're going to man up

17:00.785 --> 17:02.705
and get out there and do that interview.

17:04.265 --> 17:06.145
You pathetic little shit-clot.

17:06.545 --> 17:09.744
Now, you dry up those eyes.
We're doing the interview. Ten minutes.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.385
Oh, shit. Too high.

17:25.265 --> 17:26.665
Is everything OK?

17:27.265 --> 17:29.185
Yeah, yeah. No, no, I'm good, um...

17:29.985 --> 17:32.425
Just trying to get some...
you know, fresh air.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.385
OK. Well, um... your doctor's on line one.

17:36.025 --> 17:37.705
Thanks. Thanks, Michael. Yeah.

17:38.385 --> 17:41.145
- Oh, could you just... Um, yeah.
- Yeah.

17:43.785 --> 17:44.785
Thanks.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.505
Uh, yeah, if you wouldn't mind?
You know, it could be of a, you know...

17:48.585 --> 17:49.545
Yes.

17:53.905 --> 17:57.025
- What's going on?
- Uh, it's done. I dumped the body.

17:57.105 --> 17:58.505
I thought you'd been arrested!

17:58.905 --> 18:01.025
There was a cop asking
to look in your boot.

18:01.105 --> 18:04.945
Oh, yes. Yes. He was helping me
change my rear wheel.

18:05.025 --> 18:06.465
Um, it's sorted.

18:06.545 --> 18:09.065
The plan went to, uh, plan.

18:11.025 --> 18:12.025
Oh, thank God.

18:13.185 --> 18:15.065
You were supposed
to call me on Ash's phone.

18:15.145 --> 18:16.425
<i>For the alibi.</i>

18:16.505 --> 18:18.745
Yes. Yes, uh...
That one ran out of battery too.

18:19.545 --> 18:23.505
These... These things last about
as long as a Middle-Eastern ceasefire.

18:23.585 --> 18:25.425
Don't they, Daniel?

18:26.785 --> 18:27.665
Daniel?

18:27.745 --> 18:29.465
<i>Daniel? Uh, are you there?</i>

18:29.865 --> 18:30.865
<i>Daniel?</i>

18:30.945 --> 18:32.105
<i>Daniel...</i>

18:48.225 --> 18:49.225
OK.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.625
I'll play ball.

18:51.345 --> 18:52.345
Was that a joke?

18:53.705 --> 18:55.665
Oh! No! No, no, no.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.265
Pity.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.505
It's a good one.

19:14.545 --> 19:17.105
So, Mr. West, it seems
there's a bit more to this story

19:17.185 --> 19:18.425
than we initially thought.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.625
Of course, um,

19:19.705 --> 19:24.665
Daniel had just received the worst news
that a person can possibly receive.

19:25.625 --> 19:30.105
He had been diagnosed
with life-threatening cancer.

19:30.745 --> 19:33.625
And we hope that those
that are sharing the clip...

19:33.705 --> 19:35.265
and it is a great clip...

19:35.665 --> 19:38.665
will think about the story
behind the story

19:39.105 --> 19:40.105
as they view it.

19:40.545 --> 19:42.385
And, Daniel, how has this affected you?

19:43.105 --> 19:45.425
We Cover have been so supportive.

19:45.745 --> 19:46.945
Oh, of course.

19:47.025 --> 19:51.505
Uh, my girlfriend, Becca,
you know, she's stood by my side.

19:51.945 --> 19:54.985
And, um... my best friend, Ash,

19:55.745 --> 19:59.545
he, um... I haven't seen him
in a couple of days, um...

20:00.185 --> 20:01.985
but we're planning on meeting up soon.

20:03.065 --> 20:07.705
As it seems like ages
since we last saw each other,

20:07.785 --> 20:11.665
even though it's only been
a couple of days.

20:16.585 --> 20:18.425
Two hours I waited.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.425
I was so hungry
I tried to juice a fucking banana.

20:22.345 --> 20:23.345
And somehow,

20:23.425 --> 20:27.905
you still managed to come home
with the wrong fucking stuff.

20:27.985 --> 20:30.505
I... I know, I know. I'm sorry.

20:30.585 --> 20:36.025
I mean, how is almond milk
the same as coconut water?

20:38.545 --> 20:39.785
- Both nuts.
- I beg your pardon?

20:40.185 --> 20:43.025
I said, "They are both derived from nuts."

20:44.065 --> 20:45.065
Please don't.

20:45.145 --> 20:46.345
Annette, please.

20:58.025 --> 21:00.665
<i>Hi, Daniel, it's Vanessaaa.</i>

21:00.745 --> 21:03.105
<i>I've got bad news about Aaash.</i>

21:03.185 --> 21:06.105
<i>He's died after falling
from your bedroom window</i>

21:06.185 --> 21:08.145
<i>after fucking your girlfriend.</i>

21:08.225 --> 21:10.305
Yeah, can you...
can you please be serious?

21:10.385 --> 21:13.145
You know, I need to work out how
I'm going to react when she calls.

21:13.865 --> 21:16.145
You know, what do I do? Do I cry?

21:16.905 --> 21:18.225
Go all quiet? What?

21:18.305 --> 21:20.105
<i>Well, how do you feel about it?</i>

21:20.865 --> 21:22.185
Uh, I don't know.

21:22.905 --> 21:24.545
He was fucking Becca.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.665
But, you know, he was also my best friend.

21:28.105 --> 21:30.425
<i>Well, just be your usual bullshitty self.</i>

21:33.625 --> 21:34.905
- Oh, God.
- <i>What?</i>

21:35.505 --> 21:38.865
- Shit, it's Vanessa.
- <i>Oh! Do not quit. I wanna hear this!</i>

21:40.465 --> 21:43.745
Uh, I can't do it. I can't.
I can't speak to her.

21:43.825 --> 21:47.025
<i>Dude, you have to. You gotta
pretend everything's normal, yeah?</i>

21:47.105 --> 21:49.225
I'll call her back. I... I need a minute.

21:49.305 --> 21:50.665
<i>Pussy.</i>

21:50.745 --> 21:53.025
Oh, fuck! She's calling again!

21:54.385 --> 21:56.465
Shall I get that for you
so you can carry on?

21:56.545 --> 21:59.745
- Thanks, yeah.
- <i>Oh, God. You lucky fucker.</i>

22:01.185 --> 22:02.745
Hi, Vanessa. Sorry, Daniel's just...

22:04.185 --> 22:05.185
Oh, my God.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.025
What's... What's up?

22:07.745 --> 22:08.745
It's Ash. He's...

22:09.865 --> 22:11.225
He's been in an accident. He's...

22:11.905 --> 22:13.305
- He's in hospital.
- He's dead?

22:13.385 --> 22:16.065
No, he's not dead, he's in the hospital.
He was hit by a car.

22:17.025 --> 22:19.705
- He's... not... dead?
- No!

22:19.785 --> 22:21.185
He's in surgery!

22:21.265 --> 22:24.105
- Oh, my God...
- <i>Ash is alive?</i>

22:24.185 --> 22:25.905
<i>Dude, what the fuck?!</i>
