WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:11.017
- There's a category of people
that I work with

00:11.053 --> 00:13.389
that are
infuriatingly talented...

00:19.145 --> 00:22.565
that connect to an audience,
connect to what we do,

00:22.690 --> 00:23.733
that value it,

00:23.941 --> 00:26.235
being part of it
and caring about it.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.490
As long
as they're in this world,

00:32.198 --> 00:34.910
I think you always recognize
whatever it is

00:35.036 --> 00:36.120
when you see it.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.289
You're always drawn to that.

00:42.835 --> 00:43.878
- And... mark.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.506
- It's actually Mike Myers,
all right, not Mark.

00:47.631 --> 00:50.301
- How's everybody?
Good, good, good.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.386
- Any time you get to talk
about Chris Farley

00:52.511 --> 00:53.763
is a good day, man.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.973
- You want this somewhere?

00:56.098 --> 00:58.642
- Everybody cries for this,
right?

01:03.355 --> 01:04.355
- Don't give up.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.441
- Yikes.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.194
- Doo doo, on the right track.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.615
- I haven't "had sex
with a woman."

01:12.865 --> 01:14.408
- I "don't know how that works."

01:14.533 --> 01:17.495
- Natural ability, like,
you can't even talk about it.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.954
It's just natural.

01:20.206 --> 01:22.124
- Lay off me, I'm starving!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.628
- The funniest guy ever.
It was nuts. Nuts.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.796
- Booyah!

01:28.297 --> 01:29.632
- "Hello, Malibu!"

01:30.132 --> 01:31.842
- I wanted my time with Chris.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.303
- Well, maybe I'm not
"the norm."

01:35.930 --> 01:37.848
I'm not "camera friendly."

01:38.099 --> 01:39.683
- You know, when everybody's
deciding who's the funniest,

01:39.809 --> 01:42.145
YOU 90,
"Farley is the funniest."

01:45.648 --> 01:46.899
- You're from Wisconsin, right?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.234
Madison, Wisconsin?
- Yes, sir.

01:48.359 --> 01:49.985
- Beautiful state
and a very nice city.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.570
Madison, I think,
is the capital of Wisconsin,

01:51.695 --> 01:52.738
Fight?

01:52.863 --> 01:54.615
- Yeah. [coughs]
- Yeah.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.742
- Sorry about...
[grunts]

01:57.493 --> 01:59.203
- [giggling]

02:06.669 --> 02:09.630
- All right, put your hands
together for Kevin Farley!

02:09.755 --> 02:10.798
Come on, baby!

02:11.340 --> 02:12.675
[audience cheers]

02:13.926 --> 02:14.969
- Hi, Madison.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.221
Are you having fun?

02:17.763 --> 02:19.890
It's Saturday night
in Mad-town...

02:20.015 --> 02:21.100
Isn't that right?

02:21.225 --> 02:23.185
I'm the one that looks
like Chris the most, right?

02:23.185 --> 02:24.687
I look like Chris. Yeah.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.812
[audience cheers]

02:25.813 --> 02:26.856
- Ah-ow!

02:27.106 --> 02:28.357
-[laughs] Ah-ow!

02:28.858 --> 02:29.775
But it is kind of funny, though.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.943
Like, I do look like Chris
a lot,

02:31.068 --> 02:33.154
and so I go out of hotel rooms,

02:33.821 --> 02:34.821
and this guy came...

02:34.905 --> 02:36.657
I came out of the hotel
the other day,

02:36.782 --> 02:39.118
and the guy goes,
"You're that guy,"

02:39.243 --> 02:41.787
and I go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I look like that guy,"

02:41.912 --> 02:42.997
and he goes,
"Honey, get over here.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.290
It's Chaz Bono."

02:44.498 --> 02:46.375
[audience laughs]

02:49.837 --> 02:51.255
I go, "Not that guy."

02:53.799 --> 02:55.801
It was a lot of fun
growing up here,

02:55.926 --> 02:58.179
just a lot of great memories,
you know.

02:58.304 --> 03:01.807
You know, very peaceful,
and a simpler time, you know,

03:01.932 --> 03:02.975
in the '70s.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.936
There's the old haunt...

03:07.688 --> 03:09.064
the house I grew up in.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.150
But boy, when we lived here,
it was pretty simple.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.318
We had a lot of fun
in that house,

03:12.443 --> 03:13.777
I'll tell you that.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.906
- [music] You came
into the world [music]

03:18.574 --> 03:20.576
- Chris was the middle child,

03:20.910 --> 03:22.077
the black sheep,

03:23.495 --> 03:24.663
the strange one.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.750
- He always wanted
to certainly outdo me

03:27.875 --> 03:29.251
or show the younger two brothers

03:29.376 --> 03:30.669
that, you know,
he was better than that.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.421
He was just always... a game.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.633
- It's like Americana
that everyone dreams

03:36.425 --> 03:38.093
or thinks of in the 1960s.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.261
We had it all.

03:39.428 --> 03:42.139
What's ever
in everybody's imagination,

03:42.264 --> 03:43.307
totally true.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.059
Crazy, crazy, crazy-

03:45.267 --> 03:46.685
- [music] Don't let nobody [music]

03:48.354 --> 03:50.189
[music] Try to dampen your flame [music]

03:50.981 --> 03:53.108
- The poor world only got to see

03:53.234 --> 03:55.986
this part of the iceberg
that is Chris.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.989
- We lived
in a very quiet little town,

03:59.114 --> 04:01.158
Maple Bluff, little village.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.868
We were outside a lot,
playing a lot.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.163
You know, my mom would say
there was four boys and Barb.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.748
If you were shooting hoops
in the backyard

04:07.873 --> 04:09.041
and Morn came out,

04:09.416 --> 04:10.960
and the four of us shouted,
"Mom, look at this. Look at me!

04:11.085 --> 04:12.253
Mom! Look at me!"

04:13.003 --> 04:15.547
You've got to say that
before every shot?

04:15.673 --> 04:17.091
"Mommy, look at me"?

04:18.050 --> 04:20.886
It's so clear-cut,
striving for attention.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.972
- [music] 'Cause you were born
on fire [music]

04:23.097 --> 04:24.515
[music] Da da da da
da da da [music]

04:26.267 --> 04:27.347
[music] Da da da da [music]

04:28.310 --> 04:29.310
- What kind of a life

04:29.311 --> 04:31.192
did you and your folks
have when you were a kid?

04:31.230 --> 04:33.357
- Oh, lord, Dave,
I put them through hell.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.359
[audience laughs]

04:37.152 --> 04:38.279
- My dad was a great guy.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.322
He was a salesman,
just hilarious.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.448
I mean, it wasn't a house

04:41.573 --> 04:44.159
where, you know, Dad was strict
or anything like that,

04:44.285 --> 04:46.245
and he'd get home
and watch the news,

04:46.370 --> 04:47.997
and then,
you know, stir us all up

04:48.122 --> 04:49.248
into some kind of frenzy,

04:49.373 --> 04:50.374
and then
somebody would get hurt,

04:50.499 --> 04:51.917
and then he'd go,
"All right, that's enough."

04:52.042 --> 04:53.460
"You took it too far."

04:54.044 --> 04:55.379
And he started the whole thing.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.215
He liked to have the chaos,
I think, a lot of the times.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.342
- Our family dinner table,
Chris had a presence.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.345
He loved to be the entertainer,
for sure.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.889
- There was a lot of competition
that way

05:06.015 --> 05:07.933
on who could do
the funniest thing.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.311
He usually won most of the time.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.397
He just demanded it.

05:14.982 --> 05:15.983
We were probably
in fourth grade,

05:16.108 --> 05:18.027
and we had a bus
that went across town,

05:18.152 --> 05:20.904
and he would sing,
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog."

05:21.030 --> 05:22.865
[music] Jeremiah was a bullfrog [music]

05:23.699 --> 05:25.784
And he had the whole bus
standing up, singing.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.245
He took his shirt off for that,
on the school bus,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.331
and just sang it in the front.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.333
- I liked a girl
named Chris Bayer,

05:32.458 --> 05:34.168
and so he'd be
in the back of the bus,

05:34.293 --> 05:37.796
going, [music] Johnny Farley
loves Chris Bare-Naked! [music]

05:37.921 --> 05:39.298
[music] Johnny Farley... [music]

05:39.423 --> 05:40.966
He got the whole bus
to chant it,

05:41.091 --> 05:43.927
and I was in the front,
going, "Oh, why?"

05:44.428 --> 05:45.596
- In grade school,
at St. Patrick's,

05:45.721 --> 05:47.264
my mom was in a semicircle

05:47.389 --> 05:48.390
with a bunch of nuns around it,

05:48.515 --> 05:49.808
and they were saying,

05:49.933 --> 05:51.214
"You know,
the students at school

05:51.310 --> 05:53.395
are laughing at Christopher,
not with him."

05:53.520 --> 05:54.897
-[Letterman laughs]

05:55.022 --> 05:56.022
- And then...

05:56.106 --> 05:57.316
- When VHS came out, you know,

05:57.441 --> 05:58.275
Dad was one of the first,
you know,

05:58.400 --> 06:00.152
"Look at this new machine
I got,"

06:00.277 --> 06:02.154
and we're, like,
taping stuff off the TV,

06:02.279 --> 06:04.156
and we're watching it
over and over again.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.367
We had just stockpiles
of everything.

06:06.492 --> 06:09.370
And we watched Carol Burnett,
Jackie Gleason...

06:09.495 --> 06:10.871
Gleason was king in our house...

06:10.996 --> 06:14.583
the big comics, to us,
'cause they reminded us of Dad.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.339
- It was just comedy, comedy,
comedy all the time.

06:20.464 --> 06:24.051
- We would memorize comedy movies
start to finish,

06:24.301 --> 06:28.389
and we used to, like, you know,
quiz each other on movie lines.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.474
- Chris would find beats
in movies that we'd all watch,

06:30.599 --> 06:31.892
that every one of us
would watch.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.353
He'd find, like, characters
in the background, like...

06:34.478 --> 06:35.854
"That fat kid's funny
in Meatballs.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.356
I'm going to steal that bit."

06:37.481 --> 06:39.858
And he would use it.
It was hilarious.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.362
- This old country road
leads into a beautiful sanctuary

06:43.487 --> 06:46.615
of nature's last outpost
against civilization,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.326
and deep in the recesses
of the forest,

06:49.451 --> 06:52.496
this indeed...
camp life.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.339
- The Red Arrow camp
is a big part of our family

06:58.460 --> 07:00.796
because all of us boys
went there

07:01.588 --> 07:03.632
for seven weeks in the summer,

07:03.757 --> 07:05.592
up in Minocqua,
in Woodruff, Wisconsin.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.053
- Dad said,
"You're going up to camp."

07:08.178 --> 07:12.516
Your riding, soccer, baseball,
swimming, sailing, skiing,

07:12.891 --> 07:14.476
you know, we did it all,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.520
but the really interesting thing
about camp

07:16.645 --> 07:19.773
was at the end of the summer,
they did a camp play.

07:19.898 --> 07:20.941
- We'd have auditions,

07:21.066 --> 07:23.267
and then we'd see, like,
who would have the most talent,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.112
just raw talent, as a kid,

07:25.404 --> 07:26.947
and back then,
you didn't really know.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.742
We had a play director,
a guy who wrote all the plays,

07:31.452 --> 07:33.036
named Richard Wenzel.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.746
- Chris had a lot of talent,

07:34.872 --> 07:38.292
and I recognized the ability
for him to perform,

07:38.667 --> 07:40.085
and I said, you know,

07:40.586 --> 07:42.171
"There's somebody I'm going
to have to use on stage."

07:42.296 --> 07:43.380
- There was the...

07:43.505 --> 07:44.339
Chris performing, you know,
in the living room

07:44.465 --> 07:46.508
in front of aunts and uncles
is one thing,

07:46.633 --> 07:50.971
but this was, like, you know,
staged, directioned productions,

07:51.096 --> 07:52.764
and Chris... took to it.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.684
- Talent is something
you can't put your finger on.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.894
It just happens,

07:57.019 --> 07:58.061
and he had it.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.440
- There was no theater
in our life at all

08:01.565 --> 08:04.443
until Chris started, you know,
doing this stuff.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.446
- He started to think,
"Wow, that's different."

08:07.571 --> 08:10.532
"I'm different
than the other guys this way."

08:10.657 --> 08:12.576
- It wasn't a pussy thing,
as he always said.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.244
He said, "Oh,
I don't want to be in a play."

08:14.369 --> 08:15.704
"That's for pussies."

08:15.829 --> 08:17.164
Well, he was a pussy.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.665
He really was a pussy,

08:18.790 --> 08:19.833
and he did it,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.407
and he could do it beautifully.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.836
[laughs]

08:24.630 --> 08:26.548
- Chris and I
went to Edgewood High School

08:26.673 --> 08:28.008
in Madison, Wisconsin,

08:28.133 --> 08:29.259
a Catholic school.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.511
He lived for playing football.
He was nose guard,

08:30.636 --> 08:34.222
and he just loved being
a part of the football team.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.265
He always wanted to be
a part of the athletic crowd,

08:36.390 --> 08:37.476
you know, the jocks,

08:37.601 --> 08:38.434
and I would get, like,

08:38.559 --> 08:41.230
the stories
that would come down, you know.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.813
Like, "You're Chris's brother?"

08:42.940 --> 08:45.359
"Are you going to, like,
pull your pants down?"

08:45.484 --> 08:47.319
You know,
and I'd be like, "No."

08:47.444 --> 08:49.988
"Oh, okay. Well, your brother
does that a lot."

08:50.113 --> 08:52.449
- I brought my parents in
to get out of the trouble,

08:52.574 --> 08:54.785
and said, like,
"They don't love me at home,"

08:54.910 --> 08:56.662
and my dad's sitting there
in this counseling session,

08:56.787 --> 08:59.665
going, "Yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, we don't love him, yeah."

08:59.790 --> 09:01.458
"The only kid in the family
with a 10-speed bike,"

09:01.583 --> 09:02.709
"and we don't love him."

09:02.834 --> 09:03.877
"Yeah. Yo."

09:04.753 --> 09:06.153
So I thought
I'd got out of that jam

09:06.255 --> 09:07.297
until we got in the parking lot

09:07.422 --> 09:09.800
and he said, "Get in the car,
you prima donna!"

09:09.925 --> 09:11.426
-[Letterman laughs]

09:11.760 --> 09:13.554
- My dad would only get mad
at, like, little, small stuff,

09:13.679 --> 09:16.014
like if you were late
for the car.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.474
Then he'd just leave.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.102
It was just... the big stuff
he was really cool about,

09:20.227 --> 09:21.812
you know, like when...

09:22.563 --> 09:25.440
Chris pulled his penis out
in typing class.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.572
He was very cool about that.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.699
- He was constantly
whipping out his dick.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.661
- All the other football players
were in the typing class,

09:37.786 --> 09:39.204
and one of the older guys said,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.164
"Chris, we dare you
to unzip your fly"

09:41.290 --> 09:42.624
"and start typing"

09:43.333 --> 09:45.002
Of course, Chris did it.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.461
You know, he never said no.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.171
- The girl that saw him,

09:48.380 --> 09:50.465
she was, like,
a born-again Christian,

09:50.591 --> 09:53.218
and I don't think
she'd ever seen a penis before,

09:53.343 --> 09:55.596
certainly not one
as small as his.

09:55.721 --> 09:56.930
[laughs]

09:59.141 --> 10:00.309
She freaked out.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.881
- She's probably
still in therapy.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.647
- The nun had to have
a conference call with my dad

10:05.772 --> 10:07.232
about that, you know,

10:07.357 --> 10:08.525
so he had to talk
to a Catholic nun

10:08.650 --> 10:11.403
about how his son typed
with his penis.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.531
He was very cool about it.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.575
In fact, he laughed.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.037
- He had to go.
He had to go.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.122
So he went away
for one semester.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.728
- He was like,
"Heh, heh, you know..."

10:23.749 --> 10:24.791
"It was funny."

10:25.000 --> 10:26.501
I don't know why.
Weird.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.087
- He thought it was funny,
and it was.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.714
It always got a laugh.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.258
But that continued on
into adulthood,

10:33.383 --> 10:34.885
which was a little strange.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.471
- Did you go to college?

10:38.555 --> 10:39.556
- Yeah, I went
to Marquette University.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.891
- Oh, good school.
- Yeah.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.809
- When you went to college,
what kind of a kid were you?

10:42.934 --> 10:44.728
Was that... you probably were
a little more comfortable

10:44.853 --> 10:46.480
being away from home then?

10:46.605 --> 10:47.856
- Dave, the trouble continued.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.986
[laughter]

10:56.073 --> 10:57.115
- Oh, my god.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.159
- Chris goes off to college,

10:59.534 --> 11:00.702
and they don't have
a football team,

11:00.827 --> 11:02.663
so he joins the rugby team,

11:02.829 --> 11:04.665
and he's never played rugby
in his life.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.541
- We met in a bar
called The Green Tree.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.127
He couldn't have looked
more preppy if you...

11:09.252 --> 11:11.046
I never even saw
anybody like that,

11:11.171 --> 11:12.714
dressed in his pink Izod shirt

11:12.839 --> 11:15.801
and those fucking khaki pants
and stupid shoes.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.219
He was there to perform.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.888
I think he may have spoken to me
with the end of his penis.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.556
I can't quite remember,

11:21.682 --> 11:22.683
but I believe
there was some discussion

11:22.808 --> 11:24.685
when I spoke just to his penis.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.644
We were a good team,

11:25.769 --> 11:29.439
but we were also
an alcohol-fueled organization.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.441
- He always wanted
to be part of a group, you know,

11:31.566 --> 11:34.069
part of an ensemble,
part of a team.

11:34.820 --> 11:35.821
You know, he loved it,

11:35.946 --> 11:37.614
and he liked
to play his role in it.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.701
- To make the "A" side
as a sophomore was a big deal.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.745
Everybody on the team
took it really seriously.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.581
They, you know, would jog
four miles to practice.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.958
- Chris was a great athlete.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.168
He'd dribble a basketball
between his legs,

11:50.293 --> 11:52.295
but he wasn't in the best shape.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.631
He had a specific build,
for sure,

11:54.756 --> 11:58.260
and either you run with it,
or you run away from it.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.597
- He really wanted
to impress upon the others

12:02.723 --> 12:05.726
that were seniors and juniors
and really good athletes

12:05.851 --> 12:07.571
that he was as good an athlete
as they were.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.645
- There'd be a line out,

12:08.770 --> 12:09.604
which is where, like,
five or six guys line up

12:09.730 --> 12:11.648
and somebody throws the ball in,

12:11.773 --> 12:13.650
and Chris would just
grab his shorts

12:13.775 --> 12:15.235
and pull them all the way up

12:15.360 --> 12:16.801
to what would be
a present-day thong,

12:16.862 --> 12:18.062
you know, which was hilarious,

12:18.155 --> 12:20.657
but you're kind of like,
"I don't think that's right."

12:20.782 --> 12:21.908
- Right before
the ball comes in,

12:22.033 --> 12:23.076
he'd go, "Hag"

12:23.535 --> 12:24.953
like he was The Claw.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.707
There's a certain level of fear
that he instills in people,

12:28.832 --> 12:29.875
you know.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.003
He has a frightening element
that I think is hilarious.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.464
- It was almost like
an extended family to him

12:35.589 --> 12:36.965
because everybody
was just loud and fun,

12:37.090 --> 12:38.967
and he could be
the loudest and funnest.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.012
- The cliche is,
it's a gentleman's sport

12:42.179 --> 12:43.597
played by ruffians.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.557
- There's three halves in rugby.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.443
The first half,
the second half on the pitch,

12:47.559 --> 12:49.686
and the third half in the party.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.480
- We'd always say that,
you know, we may lose the game,

12:51.605 --> 12:53.190
but we'll win the party,

12:53.315 --> 12:54.775
and Chris
was a big part of that.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.651
The other team would be drawn
to Chris immediately

12:56.777 --> 12:59.362
because he was such a show
unto himself.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.323
- We had fun, huh?
- Yeah!

13:03.492 --> 13:04.493
- The girls would...

13:04.618 --> 13:06.369
Some of them didn't like
some of the stunts

13:06.495 --> 13:07.704
that Chris would pull.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.831
If there was a couple girls
walking down the street

13:09.956 --> 13:11.208
and you'd say,
"Oh, that girl's cute,"

13:11.333 --> 13:12.584
he's like, "Hold my books,"

13:12.709 --> 13:15.462
and he'd run, start jogging
in front of them,

13:15.587 --> 13:17.047
you know, kicking up his legs.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.340
- Hi. How are you?

13:19.049 --> 13:20.717
- A pretty woman would be
walking by in Madison,

13:20.842 --> 13:24.513
and he'd drop and do pushups
and just go, "198, 199,"

13:25.263 --> 13:26.515
like... [laughs]

13:26.723 --> 13:27.849
But he did it
with such commitment.

13:27.974 --> 13:28.892
- And it always
kind of got a laugh,

13:29.017 --> 13:30.393
like, "How are you
doing, ladies?"

13:30.519 --> 13:31.559
He would do all these bits

13:31.561 --> 13:32.842
in the hopes
that they'd be like,

13:32.854 --> 13:34.105
"Mmm, you're funny."

13:34.231 --> 13:36.149
- He had some girlfriends that
really liked him and saw...

13:36.274 --> 13:37.108
and they had...

13:37.234 --> 13:38.915
she had to have
a sense of humor, you know,

13:38.944 --> 13:40.362
to go out with Chris.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.282
- Well, she dumped me,
like they all did,

13:44.407 --> 13:46.076
and, you know,
she was a nice gal.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.870
I remember we used to have
nicknames for each other.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.832
"My raven-haired one-eyed pixie
that stole America's heart,"

13:51.957 --> 13:52.916
and things like that.
- That's cute.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.251
And did she have a nickname
for yourself?

13:54.376 --> 13:55.252
- She'd call me "Fatso..."

13:55.377 --> 13:57.212
- [laughter]
- And it never...

13:57.337 --> 13:58.380
- [chuckles]

13:58.964 --> 14:00.882
- If we were hanging out with,
like, at a party,

14:01.007 --> 14:03.844
with a keg with a bunch <i>of...</i>
everybody with a red cup,

14:03.969 --> 14:05.804
and he'd go see a bunch of girls
talking to each other,

14:05.929 --> 14:07.305
and he'd go roll in the mud
in front of them,

14:07.430 --> 14:09.266
and then pop up and be like,

14:09.599 --> 14:11.434
"You guys,
do you want to go out later?"

14:11.560 --> 14:13.186
you know,
or say some stupid line.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.479
"So what's your number?"

14:14.604 --> 14:16.523
and just throwing the beer
all over himself

14:16.648 --> 14:17.774
or just something...

14:17.899 --> 14:19.901
- We're going to show this world
a thing or two.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.611
We're going to show...

14:22.070 --> 14:23.113
[Crash]

14:23.446 --> 14:24.489
[laughter]

14:24.906 --> 14:26.408
- Blacking out is, like...
"Did you black out last night?"

14:26.533 --> 14:27.533
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

14:27.576 --> 14:29.786
Blackout City, motherfuckers!

14:29.911 --> 14:31.913
Let's all black out tonight.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.694
- We knew
we wanted to do comedy,

14:33.790 --> 14:35.500
but had no idea
how to do it at all.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.626
Now, Marquette
had this new thing

14:36.751 --> 14:37.751
called the Follies,

14:37.836 --> 14:39.796
where they had bands
and acts and magicians

14:39.921 --> 14:40.881
and anybody who had a talent,

14:41.006 --> 14:42.132
and they'd pack
the varsity theater

14:42.257 --> 14:43.592
with 2,000 people,

14:43.800 --> 14:46.052
and they'd have a variety show,
which is awesome.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.764
So we said, "We should sign up
for the Follies."

14:49.890 --> 14:51.266
"We've got, like, two minutes."

14:51.391 --> 14:52.431
"What are we going to do?"

14:52.517 --> 14:54.519
Chris takes my collar,
flicks it up.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.062
He goes, "You're Cool Guy."

14:56.187 --> 14:57.628
And I go,
"What are you going to be?"

14:57.689 --> 14:58.773
Chris puts on
these kind of nerdy glasses,

14:58.899 --> 15:00.734
and he goes, "I'll be Nerd Guy."

15:00.859 --> 15:03.361
- I'm not supposed to be here.
Uh...

15:03.778 --> 15:06.072
- I go out,
kind of get a few laughs,

15:06.197 --> 15:07.197
give a silly little run.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.701
Chris comes running out
full blast...

15:09.826 --> 15:11.828
trips, slides, bowling ball,

15:11.953 --> 15:14.539
knocks over his chair,
two other chairs.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.207
The place is going berserk.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.751
They're going crazy-

15:17.876 --> 15:18.919
Lights go out.

15:19.669 --> 15:20.795
And then
we're running backstage.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.964
It felt like
our shirts were even, just,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.841
were blowing
in the wind of the audience,

15:24.966 --> 15:26.718
like, applause and laughter.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.511
And Chris just stops,
and he turns to me

15:28.637 --> 15:29.638
right at the edge of the curtain
backstage

15:29.763 --> 15:31.264
and goes, "This is it."

15:33.016 --> 15:35.852
"This is what we're going to do
for the rest of our lives."

15:35.977 --> 15:38.021
- Did you hear
I finally graduated?

15:38.146 --> 15:40.023
- Yeah, in just a shade
under a decade, too.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.191
All right.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.638
- You know, a lot of people
go to college for seven years.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.195
- I know.
They're called doctors.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.613
- Clearly, you know,

15:46.738 --> 15:48.198
Dad realized
right from the start

15:48.323 --> 15:49.824
that he was unemployable

15:49.950 --> 15:50.909
and there was only one employer

15:51.034 --> 15:52.395
that could possibly
give him a job,

15:52.452 --> 15:53.620
and that was him.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.538
One thing Dad realized
really quickly,

15:55.664 --> 15:57.415
and which is easy to spot,

15:57.874 --> 15:59.459
is the guy knew people.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.544
- You just liked him right away,

16:01.670 --> 16:04.005
and you'd buy anything
they had to sell.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.171
- Hey, I'll tell you what.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.841
You could take a good look
at a butcher's ass

16:06.967 --> 16:08.218
by sticking your head up there,

16:08.343 --> 16:11.137
but wouldn't you rather
take his word for it?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.262
- What?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.306
- They had an oil company

16:13.431 --> 16:15.809
where they sold oil for pavement
and asphalt and things,

16:15.934 --> 16:16.977
and did well,

16:17.102 --> 16:19.354
and Chris goes,
"All I do is, um,"

16:19.813 --> 16:21.898
"I take these guys out,
uh, to dinner..."

16:22.023 --> 16:25.693
"uh, we just drink and eat,
and I don't pay for anything,"

16:25.819 --> 16:27.070
"and then at the end, I go,"

16:27.195 --> 16:30.448
" 'My dad wanted you guys
to sign this contract.' "

16:31.074 --> 16:32.993
" 'Is that... can you do that?' "

16:33.368 --> 16:34.661
"And they'd go, 'Sure, sure,' "

16:34.786 --> 16:36.871
"and then my dad gave me money."

16:37.205 --> 16:38.707
- Okay, I'll buy it from you.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.000
- Well, that's...
- What?

16:40.125 --> 16:42.210
- You could see why Chris's dad
was grooming him

16:42.335 --> 16:43.376
to take over the business,

16:43.378 --> 16:46.047
because it was obvious
that Chris could...

16:46.172 --> 16:48.049
had that kind of effect
on people,

16:48.174 --> 16:50.135
the kind of slapping people
on the back.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.013
- Both Chris and I worked
for my dad's asphalt company,

16:53.138 --> 16:54.889
Scotch Oil Company here in town.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.433
Nobody heard of it?
Okay.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.892
[audience laughs]

16:58.018 --> 16:59.144
But asphalt's not too hard
to sell, folks,

16:59.269 --> 17:00.854
because you either want it
or you don't.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.313
[audience laughs]

17:03.023 --> 17:05.150
- Chris's office
at Scotch Oil Company...

17:05.275 --> 17:06.108
we would go in,

17:06.233 --> 17:08.486
"Oh,
look at the little president."

17:08.611 --> 17:09.611
We'd make fun of him.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.239
We were, like, "Daddy,"
and, like,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.949
"Let's see what you're working
on there, champ."

17:13.074 --> 17:15.743
- [voice vibrating]
Luke... Luke...

17:16.202 --> 17:17.369
I am your father.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.330
- I'd open up his desk,

17:20.457 --> 17:24.002
and it'd be, like Mad magazine,
Cracked magazine...

17:24.127 --> 17:26.378
Where is anything
resembling work on this desk,

17:26.503 --> 17:27.547
at all?

17:27.756 --> 17:30.216
"What have you been doing?"
He goes, "What? Get out of here.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.509
Get out of here."

17:32.010 --> 17:34.888
- He was so encouraged
at Marquette to get onstage

17:35.013 --> 17:37.140
and do something
in the drama field.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.268
They had this little theater
called the Ark Improv Theater.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.393
- There was always

17:41.436 --> 17:44.230
a kind of nice little storefront
theater scene there.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.734
Most of the theaters there
tend to be former garages

17:47.859 --> 17:49.194
or future laundromats.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.904
The director tends to be

17:51.029 --> 17:53.615
the guy who goes out
and buys paper towels, you know.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.866
- It's late, you know.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.993
It's midnight, I don't know.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.369
It was a long day,

17:58.828 --> 18:01.164
and in walks
this big, giant guy,

18:03.708 --> 18:06.044
with this big smile, staggering.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.755
"Do you guys do classes?"

18:09.172 --> 18:10.215
[laughs]

18:11.007 --> 18:12.759
And I said,
"Yeah, yeah, we do classes."

18:12.884 --> 18:14.844
"My wife has a class
tomorrow morning,"

18:14.969 --> 18:17.013
"Saturday morning at 10:00.
Here."

18:17.138 --> 18:19.641
He reached out
and grabbed my hand,

18:20.016 --> 18:22.018
and he shook it, like, "Ouch!"

18:22.143 --> 18:24.145
Like I saved his life.
"Thank you, man!"

18:24.270 --> 18:25.688
[hyperventilates]

18:26.231 --> 18:27.982
So the next morning, I wake up,

18:28.108 --> 18:30.693
and my wife calls me
from the theater

18:31.027 --> 18:33.279
and <i>says,</i>
"Did you invite some guy

18:33.404 --> 18:35.698
to come and take my class
this morning?"

18:35.824 --> 18:36.866
I said, "Oh!"

18:38.118 --> 18:39.702
"Yeah, I did, but I, I, I,"

18:41.162 --> 18:43.748
"I didn't think
he would ever show up,"

18:43.873 --> 18:45.154
and she says, "Well, he's here,"

18:45.208 --> 18:46.459
"and he brought
a case of beer."

18:46.584 --> 18:47.627
[laughs]

18:49.129 --> 18:50.171
- Hi there.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.383
Officer Fred McGuire,
local one-niner-niner.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.969
- Kind of jaw-dropping at times
to watch Chris work,

18:56.094 --> 18:58.346
even on a local little stage
like the Ark.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.808
The power of his talent was,
even in a raw state,

19:03.434 --> 19:04.769
was so undeniable.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.938
-[mumbles as the Godfather]

19:07.063 --> 19:09.357
- He just had such presence
and charisma.

19:09.482 --> 19:13.903
- Chris had this amazing talent,
this perfect storm of comedy.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.321
Boom!
Obvious.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.741
- My love, you ate
the liverwurst!

19:19.284 --> 19:20.326
- I was hungry.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.289
- He found this art form
where you work in an ensemble,

19:24.414 --> 19:26.624
and, you know,
you work off each other,

19:26.749 --> 19:27.959
and there's no denial.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.003
It's all about acceptance.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.796
- I do remember
going every weekend

19:31.921 --> 19:33.047
and laughing my head off.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.632
I mean, I wouldn't miss it.
It was the best.

19:34.757 --> 19:35.958
- The shows were really weird.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.219
The shows were, like, bizarre.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.180
I didn't even get any of them.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.140
Chris would come out
<i>as</i> Elvis, Fat Elvis.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.351
"Well, bless my soul,
what's wrong with me?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.811
I think I shit my pants."

19:46.936 --> 19:48.146
- And then
he'd keel over on stage,

19:48.271 --> 19:49.564
and the lights would go out.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.607
-[imitates curtain falling]

19:50.732 --> 19:52.734
"Okay, what did we just watch?"

19:59.407 --> 20:02.327
- See, the thing about Chris
is his heart,

20:03.620 --> 20:05.455
this really kind, gentle,

20:05.872 --> 20:07.790
childish, innocent heart,

20:09.959 --> 20:12.462
which, I say,
was the perfect storm,

20:12.587 --> 20:15.256
because
in that kind and gentle heart

20:17.258 --> 20:19.761
was also
a very frightened person.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.722
I was sad to see him go

20:23.431 --> 20:25.642
because I thought
it was too soon.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.853
He was just beginning improv
and coming into a craft,

20:28.978 --> 20:33.399
as opposed to a party guy,
a party trick.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.032
- Chris comes down to Chicago,
and we hook up.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.118
We know Second City's the mecca.
That's the place.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.761
We don't know what to do
or where to go,

20:44.869 --> 20:47.288
but we've gotta
do this together.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.124
We're just pacing
in front of Second City,

20:50.250 --> 20:52.293
and I swear both of us
kind of thought

20:52.418 --> 20:53.878
that on the second
or third floor

20:54.003 --> 20:55.171
of the Second City offices,

20:55.296 --> 20:57.017
somebody was going to look down
and be like,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.967
"Well, then we just need
two more people,"

20:59.092 --> 21:00.343
"or we're not going
to have a show tonight."

21:00.468 --> 21:02.428
"Hey, those two fellows
look pretty funny."

21:02.553 --> 21:03.888
As if you're going
to walk around Wrigley Field

21:04.013 --> 21:05.056
and have, "Hey!"
[creaking]

21:05.181 --> 21:06.808
"Come on in.
Play some ball."

21:09.435 --> 21:10.478
- He called to tell me,

21:10.603 --> 21:12.355
"I got into the classes
at Second City,"

21:12.480 --> 21:14.691
and I was like,
"Wow, that's awesome!"

21:14.816 --> 21:17.151
- He was far more ambitious
than I ever thought.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.529
I didn't know
that he would pursue training

21:19.654 --> 21:21.406
and end up with Del Close,

21:21.906 --> 21:24.284
king shit
of improvisational acting.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.243
- I wanted to really show

21:25.368 --> 21:27.328
that we could create art
by committee.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.372
Nothing that I hear
is going to be simple.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.249
Nothing that you say to me

21:31.416 --> 21:33.376
is going to be accepted
at face value.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.461
It always means something else.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.880
- Del Close
was a fantastic improviser,

21:38.006 --> 21:39.090
great teacher.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.299
He didn't teach comedy,

21:40.383 --> 21:41.904
because I don't think
that's teachable,

21:41.968 --> 21:43.386
but he taught creativity.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.596
Del was the creative Svengali

21:45.888 --> 21:48.391
of Bill Murray,
Belushi, Aykroyd.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.062
- Del was the chief
anarchist artist there.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.773
What he taught all of us
was to be free

21:56.316 --> 21:57.567
and to be unafraid

21:58.484 --> 22:00.987
and to go out and fail
as often as possible,

22:01.112 --> 22:03.197
to try things, to die onstage.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.825
He threw off convention

22:05.950 --> 22:07.391
and kind of blew the lid
off the form

22:07.410 --> 22:09.704
so that we could really
do the freest work,

22:09.829 --> 22:11.748
um, that we were capable of.

22:12.790 --> 22:13.791
- Okay, do it.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.505
And that's the lighting we have?

22:19.630 --> 22:20.673
Okay.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.425
- We realize perfectly well

22:22.550 --> 22:23.951
that all the characters
that we play

22:23.968 --> 22:26.304
are really subsets of ourselves,

22:27.305 --> 22:30.391
they're just ourselves
in slightly different moods,

22:30.516 --> 22:34.187
ourselves carrying
a little more emotional freight.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.897
- Del said, "Mr. Myers,"

22:36.522 --> 22:39.942
"there's somebody who I think
is a kindred spirit"

22:40.109 --> 22:41.444
"that you have to meet."

22:41.569 --> 22:43.321
"You have to meet Farley."

22:44.530 --> 22:45.573
So I met him.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.325
The second I saw him,

22:47.450 --> 22:49.285
I thought he was going
to be a giant star.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.704
- If he had just been
a big, funny guy that fell down,

22:51.829 --> 22:54.374
Del Close certainly never would
have cast him at Second City.

22:54.499 --> 22:55.958
Del Close
would have washed him out

22:56.084 --> 22:57.126
right away.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.384
He had no time for people
that were just funny,

22:59.462 --> 23:02.340
and if someone sold out a scene
for a joke,

23:02.465 --> 23:04.342
Del would sometimes
just throw them offstage.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.427
He's like, "Get the hell
out of here, you turkey."

23:06.552 --> 23:09.889
Dell wanted to work with Chris
because he was funny and honest.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.099
- The smallest,

23:11.599 --> 23:15.686
the teeniest, weeniest
emotional discovery that's real

23:16.354 --> 23:17.354
beats the hell

23:17.397 --> 23:19.982
out of the biggest one
that's phony,

23:20.358 --> 23:21.442
and that's why our audience,
I think,

23:21.567 --> 23:23.069
is so much on our side,

23:24.278 --> 23:25.559
because they want us to succeed.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.324
They have this...
They're cheering us on.

23:28.449 --> 23:31.244
- "To treat the audience
like poets and kings,

23:31.369 --> 23:33.162
and they'll respond in kind."

23:33.287 --> 23:34.455
I've always felt that way,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.958
and I saw it completely embodied
in Chris Farley.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.334
- Del loved Chris,

23:39.001 --> 23:40.128
so it's no surprise to me

23:40.253 --> 23:43.339
that Del plucked him
for the mainstage cast

23:43.798 --> 23:45.133
almost immediately.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.300
- Hello there.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.543
This must be the birthday girl.

23:49.679 --> 23:50.513
- That's right.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.640
- Hi, birthday girl.
Doogie Howser.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.100
[audience laughs]

23:56.477 --> 23:58.229
Well, I guess, then,
little birthday girl,

23:58.354 --> 23:59.689
this one's for you.

24:00.982 --> 24:04.402
[music]

24:10.575 --> 24:13.453
- For Chris, I think
Del was the Lamaze birth coach

24:13.578 --> 24:14.912
that kind of pulled

24:15.329 --> 24:18.666
all of everything
that was inside of Chris out.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.960
- He said the same thing to Chris
that he said to Belushi,

24:21.085 --> 24:24.046
which is "Go out there,
attack the stage like a bull."

24:24.172 --> 24:25.381
"You have that kind of power."

24:25.506 --> 24:27.467
"Just try to kill them
with laughter."

24:27.592 --> 24:28.592
"Just kill them."

24:28.676 --> 24:30.845
- Chris on stage was crazy,
force of nature,

24:30.970 --> 24:32.138
through the roof,

24:32.263 --> 24:37.685
quantitatively, qualitatively
amped up past everybody else.

24:39.353 --> 24:42.482
- His basic impulse
is to make situations funny.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.734
He was taught
"Don't stifle that."

24:44.859 --> 24:45.902
"Expand on it."

24:47.361 --> 24:48.404
He found his identity with that,

24:48.529 --> 24:51.365
because that was
his natural impulse as a kid.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.451
- It was really that feeling
of, like, "I get it."

24:53.534 --> 24:54.702
"I'm only going
to watch that guy"

24:54.827 --> 24:55.995
"if he's onstage,"

24:56.370 --> 24:57.890
"because there's nothing
touching him."

24:57.914 --> 25:00.541
"He is wildly entertaining."

25:02.293 --> 25:03.961
- I improvised
with Chris Farley,

25:04.086 --> 25:05.630
and I was scared to death

25:05.755 --> 25:07.507
because he had already
knocked somebody's tooth out

25:07.632 --> 25:09.592
and gave somebody else a scar

25:09.717 --> 25:11.469
from just being so crazy,

25:11.594 --> 25:13.596
and I'm...
I mean, I have a lot of energy,

25:13.721 --> 25:14.680
but I don't have that energy.

25:14.805 --> 25:15.848
- Jesus...

25:16.557 --> 25:19.769
right before he'd go on stage,
he'd drop his pants,

25:19.894 --> 25:22.730
and just pull them up
at the last second.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.391
So you're standing behind him

25:24.482 --> 25:27.068
because
if you have to go out next...

25:27.360 --> 25:28.611
you get that view.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.988
- It was
a very beer-soaked culture

25:31.113 --> 25:32.657
in the improv world, you know.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.283
We all drank too much.

25:34.492 --> 25:37.620
Parties usually involved
way too much beer drinking.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.623
- One time he showed up,
he was pretty well lit up.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.334
I was like,
"My god, you can barely talk.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.418
Are you all right to go on?"

25:44.544 --> 25:46.587
I go,
"You shouldn't go on stage."

25:46.712 --> 25:49.423
Went on stage,
was crystal clear as a bell.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.259
Made everyone laugh, hilarious.

25:51.384 --> 25:52.635
Went back to the back stage,

25:52.760 --> 25:54.679
it was like,
[slurring] "Oh, my god."

25:54.804 --> 25:56.931
I'm like, "How the hell
did you just do that?"

25:57.056 --> 25:59.684
- But he did push it.
He did push it, as John did.

25:59.809 --> 26:03.020
He had automatic charisma
like John, you know.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.814
He was a light, you know.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.442
Heads would turn
when he came into the room.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.569
- Chris loved and idolized
Belushi,

26:09.694 --> 26:11.654
but he never imitated Belushi,

26:11.779 --> 26:12.779
in the same way

26:12.780 --> 26:14.991
that a Keith Richards
might emulate

26:15.116 --> 26:16.534
his old blues heroes

26:17.159 --> 26:19.579
but never really
sound like them.

26:19.704 --> 26:24.584
He took what he loved about them
and made it his own.

26:27.712 --> 26:30.381
- I got hired
for Saturday Night Live,

26:31.215 --> 26:32.675
and they said to me, you know,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.969
"Who do you think
is good there?"

26:35.094 --> 26:37.263
I listed a whole bunch of names,

26:37.722 --> 26:40.057
but the first name I said
was Chris Farley.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.268
- Come on.
It was undeniable.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.478
You couldn't stop Chris.

26:44.604 --> 26:47.773
He leaped over everyone,
and he should have.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.358
- Everybody recognized it

26:49.483 --> 26:51.902
even if they resented it
a little.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.654
You know, it was very clear.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.656
"Yeah, of course, you know."

26:55.781 --> 26:57.533
- All righty, everybody.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.536
- He was one of the people
we'd heard about,

27:00.661 --> 27:03.998
and you could tell
how much he loved to perform.

27:04.957 --> 27:08.294
This incredible sort of
generosity of spirit,

27:08.669 --> 27:11.088
and also just
a kind of innocence.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.508
I used to say
that he was the child

27:14.634 --> 27:17.470
that Dan Aykroyd
and John Belushi didn't have.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.264
There was just a joy
in what he was doing.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.599
You were always drawn to him.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.225
I knew I was bringing him
to New York.

27:23.351 --> 27:24.471
- It's a whale.
- It's a boy.

27:24.518 --> 27:25.728
- It's a whale boy.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.188
[applause]

27:32.818 --> 27:35.237
- It was a sad going-away,
a little bit.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.363
We were happy for him,

27:36.447 --> 27:37.531
but we were
also a little nervous...

27:37.657 --> 27:39.659
like, this poor little kid
from Madison

27:39.784 --> 27:43.537
going to go to New York City,
which he'd never been to,

27:43.663 --> 27:45.164
and be on a big TV show.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.000
It's kind of a lot for him,
and it was a lot for him.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.877
He was scared.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.095
- Five, four, three,
two, one, go.

27:59.637 --> 28:02.223
Live from New York,
it's Saturday Night!

28:02.348 --> 28:03.724
- Oh, one more thing.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.434
Live from New York,
it's Saturday Night!

28:05.559 --> 28:06.602
[audience cheers]

28:06.727 --> 28:09.689
- It's so intense
that it's a joke, you know.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.148
By the time you get off of it,

28:11.273 --> 28:13.192
you're like,
"How did I survive that?

28:13.317 --> 28:14.485
That's not possible."

28:14.610 --> 28:17.321
- There's nothing
like the live performance.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.449
It is the most exhilarating,
exciting...

28:20.825 --> 28:23.661
It's, like,
heart-pounding pressure.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.621
- You know, Dana Carvey says

28:25.746 --> 28:27.706
it's like being shot
out of a cannon without a net

28:27.707 --> 28:28.541
once a week.

28:28.666 --> 28:29.750
- "Chris Farley!"

28:29.875 --> 28:31.335
"Yeah, that's right.
Chris is here.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.741
We're going to see Chris Farley
live in this tiny studio."

28:33.838 --> 28:36.424
You'd hear that applause
go up more.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.426
- He was powerful on stage.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.303
I think one of the problems
he first had

28:41.595 --> 28:42.680
when he came to the show,
I think,

28:42.805 --> 28:45.433
was he was still playing
to the back row,

28:45.558 --> 28:48.561
and the fact that the camera's
sort of here

28:48.769 --> 28:50.730
took a little while
to adjust to.

28:50.855 --> 28:51.856
He always played big,

28:51.981 --> 28:54.608
but he learned
how to play big for camera.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.819
- The week Patrick Swayze
hosted, he called me.

28:56.944 --> 28:57.987
He's like,

28:58.195 --> 28:59.989
"Lorne and everybody
wants me to be the fat guy,"

29:00.114 --> 29:03.617
"and they want me to dress
to do a sketch from, uh..."

29:04.827 --> 29:06.162
"where I'm stripping
from Chippendales"

29:06.287 --> 29:07.413
"with Patrick Swayze,"

29:07.538 --> 29:08.789
"and they want me
to take my shirt off,"

29:08.914 --> 29:10.416
"and then I'm the fat guy."

29:10.541 --> 29:11.751
"What do you think?"

29:11.876 --> 29:12.835
"I mean, it's just embarrassing,
you know."

29:12.960 --> 29:14.462
It's like,
"Well, if you do that"

29:14.587 --> 29:17.214
"and you are
the funniest fat guy ever,"

29:17.339 --> 29:18.924
"then you should do it."

29:26.432 --> 29:29.602
- I'm sure he had reservations
about going out there full-on,

29:29.727 --> 29:30.770
but he saw...

29:30.936 --> 29:33.981
"This is my mission.
This is full-on comic value."

29:34.106 --> 29:35.649
"It's a perfect use
of my physicality."

29:35.775 --> 29:37.777
"Yes, I will do it."

29:39.820 --> 29:41.864
- And there's a lot of girth
going with it

29:41.989 --> 29:43.699
and not-give-a-shit pride,

29:43.824 --> 29:45.326
and "This is my body."

29:45.493 --> 29:47.912
He's not thinking it.
He's there.

29:48.162 --> 29:51.624
- Like, I feel really lucky
that I was in high school

29:51.749 --> 29:54.043
when Chris Farley
was on Saturday Night Live.

29:54.168 --> 29:55.836
That was definitely
one of those things

29:55.961 --> 29:57.171
that all the all the kids
around the schoolyard

29:57.296 --> 29:59.048
were like, "Did you see that?"

29:59.173 --> 30:00.424
"Like, that was..."

30:01.008 --> 30:02.760
"that was out of control."

30:02.968 --> 30:05.763
Even just, like, as a fat kid,
it's like "Oh, he's my hero."

30:05.888 --> 30:08.098
Like, he took his shirt off
on national TV,

30:08.224 --> 30:11.477
and he's as good a dancer
as Patrick Swayze is.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.396
The fact that you've got

30:14.939 --> 30:17.525
the late Jan Hooks
and Kevin Nealon and Mike Myers

30:17.650 --> 30:19.485
sitting there,
like, watching, as the...

30:19.610 --> 30:20.653
If they laugh.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.656
The sketch goes poof, goes away.

30:23.781 --> 30:24.824
- I'm doing...

30:25.491 --> 30:26.491
this.

30:26.534 --> 30:27.743
I'm doing a lot of this.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.745
If you kind of look
at my face in the sketch,

30:29.870 --> 30:30.704
it's a little like a dog

30:30.830 --> 30:32.456
that's hearing
a weird frequency.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.334
It was like, "What is that?"

30:39.213 --> 30:43.801
[audience cheers]

30:46.011 --> 30:47.847
- Thank you, Adrian, Barney.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.765
If you could just
give us a minute,

30:49.890 --> 30:51.976
we'll have our decision.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.357
- Oh...

30:58.941 --> 31:01.944
- Adrian... you were great
out there, man.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.821
<i>I know... it's</i> going <i>to be you.</i>

31:03.946 --> 31:05.739
- Oh, what are you talking about,
Barney?

31:05.865 --> 31:07.950
You've got it, and you know it.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.744
- Whatever happens,
you're the best.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.581
- Buddies?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.039
- Buddies.

31:16.125 --> 31:16.959
- They're ready for you guys.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.545
- And then you've got
the thing at the end

31:19.670 --> 31:20.796
where they actually say,
"Well, no.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.841
We're going to go with,"
you know, "with this guy.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.803
He's got a better body,
and he's a much better dancer."

31:27.970 --> 31:30.973
Who did Farley beat out,
then, to get... what?

31:31.098 --> 31:33.058
Yeah, okay, yeah.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.730
- On the one hand,
Chris was acting

31:37.855 --> 31:39.857
like he was embarrassed
about playing the fat guy,

31:39.982 --> 31:41.984
but on the other hand,
he fucking loved it,

31:42.109 --> 31:44.111
and that's the contradiction
he was.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.757
- After the Chippendales,
we were like,

31:45.821 --> 31:48.240
"Oh,
this guy's going to be giant.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.950
He's going to be a huge star."

31:50.075 --> 31:52.244
But I knew that back in Chicago.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.079
- You know, growing up,

31:54.204 --> 31:55.956
you think that showbiz people
come from outer space

31:56.081 --> 31:57.081
or something.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.418
You don't expect to know anybody
who's doing this,

31:59.543 --> 32:00.711
and to just watch

32:02.671 --> 32:05.132
someone you've watched
in improv basements,

32:05.257 --> 32:07.676
you know, on the biggest
comedy stage in the world,

32:07.801 --> 32:09.303
was just so exciting.

32:10.054 --> 32:12.306
- Just to see him on TV
was crazy,

32:12.890 --> 32:14.016
and the family
would all gather around

32:14.141 --> 32:15.225
and go,
"Oh, my god, look at this."

32:15.351 --> 32:17.269
"He's on TV."

32:19.313 --> 32:21.857
- We had seen Chris's sketch,
the Chippendales sketch,

32:21.982 --> 32:23.609
and went,
"We have to sign that guy,"

32:23.734 --> 32:25.027
and he sort of just sat there,

32:25.152 --> 32:26.913
and he would nod a lot,
and then he would go,

32:27.029 --> 32:28.948
"Uh, uh, uh...
Could I be with you guys?"

32:29.073 --> 32:30.240
and we were like,

32:30.950 --> 32:31.784
"No, it's supposed to be
the other way around.

32:31.909 --> 32:33.661
We're supposed
to be pitching you."

32:33.786 --> 32:35.245
- He was incredibly friendly
immediately.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.040
He didn't see it as,
"Oh, here comes the new guy,"

32:38.165 --> 32:39.165
or "Oh, good,"

32:39.166 --> 32:40.626
"I've got more competition
on the show, bubba."

32:40.751 --> 32:42.419
He was just more like,
"Hey," like,

32:42.544 --> 32:44.171
"Fellow comedian, here we go."

32:44.296 --> 32:47.007
- First day, and I see Farley
in the lobby,

32:47.132 --> 32:48.884
and he goes "How are you?
Chris Farley."

32:49.009 --> 32:50.844
"Gallagher Tent and Awning."

32:50.970 --> 32:52.680
Flips his hair around, and...

32:52.805 --> 32:55.015
which I grew to know
over the years,

32:55.140 --> 32:58.352
that was his standard
deep voice, handshake, meet guy.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.271
- The truth is that everybody
that gets the show

33:01.397 --> 33:03.565
usually are unknown and broke.

33:04.108 --> 33:06.652
Suddenly, you know,
you're living your dream life.

33:06.777 --> 33:07.977
I mean, I always say to Lorne,

33:07.987 --> 33:09.488
"Thanks for giving me
the life I dreamed of,"

33:09.613 --> 33:11.949
and that's what you get
if you succeed on that show.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.951
- We were both getting famous,

33:14.076 --> 33:17.830
and literally, when I would walk
down the street with him,

33:17.955 --> 33:20.624
it was no one else seen
except Farley.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.007
It was just "Oh, my god,
there's Chris Farley."

33:23.085 --> 33:24.086
"There's Chris Farley.
There's Chris Farley."

33:24.211 --> 33:26.922
When I walked through Chicago
with him, my god.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.090
- Da Bears.

33:29.133 --> 33:32.052
- Welcome to another edition
of Bill Swerski's Superfans.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.178
- [burps]

33:33.303 --> 33:34.346
That was me.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.974
- Very nice.
All right.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.852
- He was 100% believable
playing the biggest character.

33:39.977 --> 33:41.478
You always were like,

33:42.146 --> 33:45.107
"Yeah, I believe this guy.
I believe this guy's real."

33:45.232 --> 33:47.026
- Everything okay?

33:47.860 --> 33:48.902
-[grunts]

33:49.319 --> 33:50.319
No problem.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.947
Just having a heart attack.

33:52.072 --> 33:52.990
- He'd be pounding his chest,
you know,

33:53.115 --> 33:54.450
having a heart attack
in a hula skirt,

33:54.575 --> 33:56.785
and you're like, "Yeah,
that could be a real guy."

33:56.910 --> 33:58.162
- By the way, I should mention

33:58.287 --> 33:59.997
that Todd was kind enough
to show up today

34:00.122 --> 34:03.000
even though earlier this week,
he had yet another heart attack.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.334
- Yeah, well, the doc says

34:04.460 --> 34:07.046
that I've got a small piece
of Polish sausage

34:07.171 --> 34:09.089
lodged
in the lining of my heart.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.424
- One of the funniest lines to me
was, like,

34:10.549 --> 34:11.632
"How many is that, Todd?"

34:11.759 --> 34:12.967
- Very nice recovery.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.636
Now, how many heart attacks
is that for you, Todd?

34:14.762 --> 34:16.929
- That makes a baker's dozen
for me.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.891
- He didn't do a ton of prep.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.141
He just goes, "Yeah, yeah,
we'll figure it out,"

34:20.266 --> 34:23.145
and there's just only X amount
you can be taught,

34:23.270 --> 34:25.022
and then there's a guy
that, like that walks in.

34:25.147 --> 34:27.440
You go, "Oh, <i>he...</i>
he skips it all,"

34:27.565 --> 34:28.565
and it works.

34:28.567 --> 34:29.735
- Da... Bulls...

34:30.069 --> 34:31.589
da Bulls, da Bulls,
da Bulls, da Bulls,

34:31.652 --> 34:32.862
da Bulls...
- Yeah.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.268
- Da Bulls, da Bulls,
da Bulls...

34:35.908 --> 34:36.949
- Very good.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.368
- Because everyone can fall down
and whatever,

34:38.494 --> 34:39.369
but you can't do it that good.

34:39.495 --> 34:43.165
He doesn't put his hands up,
which is what I would do.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.877
So he doesn't block his fall,
and that's...

34:47.002 --> 34:48.170
You can't do those forever.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.797
I think Chevy Chase warned him
not to do that.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.672
- Because Chevy'd always had
something there

34:51.799 --> 34:53.132
just before he fell

34:54.134 --> 34:55.928
that he could hit
that broke the fall,

34:56.053 --> 34:58.472
but Chris was just taking it
as paid.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.224
- Da Bulls, da Bulls, da Bulls.

35:00.349 --> 35:01.975
- He wasn't paying
close enough attention

35:02.101 --> 35:04.019
to see that there was
a way you could do it

35:04.144 --> 35:05.312
and not hurt yourself.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.272
His commitment was total.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.649
- Chris, if I happened
to be in the building

35:08.774 --> 35:09.650
and he happened to be
in the building,

35:09.775 --> 35:10.775
would knock on the door

35:10.776 --> 35:12.027
and go, "Michael!"

35:12.694 --> 35:14.530
"You're such a good writer."

35:14.655 --> 35:15.739
"What are you writing?"

35:15.864 --> 35:18.033
and I'd be like,
"I'm writing a Sprockets."

35:18.158 --> 35:19.827
He goes, "Can I be in it?"

35:20.160 --> 35:22.329
Like this, just completely...

35:22.621 --> 35:25.374
And I'd go, "I don't know.
Sure. I don't know."

35:25.499 --> 35:27.209
"Can you do a German accent?"

35:27.334 --> 35:29.253
"No, no, I can't.
I can't!"

35:30.254 --> 35:32.589
And then he'd just...
"I can't!"

35:33.132 --> 35:35.259
- He's not going
to be the idea man,

35:35.384 --> 35:38.387
but he's going
to take any idea you bring in

35:38.679 --> 35:39.847
and make it better.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.265
- I know
he didn't write for himself,

35:41.390 --> 35:42.683
because a lot of those guys
wrote for themselves,

35:42.808 --> 35:43.892
the smart ones,

35:44.184 --> 35:45.384
and they created these things,

35:45.435 --> 35:47.104
and he kind of was at the mercy
of other people.

35:47.229 --> 35:50.190
- I think he was very intimidated
by the writers.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.358
I don't think he felt

35:51.483 --> 35:53.164
like he could contribute
in sketch writing,

35:53.277 --> 35:55.437
but of course he could,
because he had great instincts,

35:55.529 --> 35:58.240
and he could put himself
into a character's mindset,

35:58.365 --> 36:01.285
and he could improvise
lines and moments

36:01.702 --> 36:03.370
by just doing the character.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.496
- All you've got to do

36:04.621 --> 36:06.039
is kind of hold on to Chris
like a ski lift, you know?

36:06.165 --> 36:07.416
He'll lift you up the hill.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.251
And so you would give him
a sketch and go,

36:09.376 --> 36:11.576
"How would you make that funny
if you said it your way?"

36:11.628 --> 36:12.869
or whatever, and honest to god,

36:12.963 --> 36:14.683
he would destroy it
with how he would do it.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.134
- When we would have
a hundred people

36:17.259 --> 36:18.760
in the read-through,

36:18.969 --> 36:21.388
it was a hundred people
pulling for Farley.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.141
He was the easiest guy
to write for, for sure.

36:24.266 --> 36:27.186
- He did try to write one sketch
because he never wrote sketches,

36:27.311 --> 36:29.646
and it was called
"Puppy Lawyer,"

36:29.771 --> 36:31.481
and it was about 14 pages,

36:31.607 --> 36:33.208
and it was horrible,
and it was too long,

36:33.317 --> 36:35.110
and at the read-through,
it was dying,

36:35.235 --> 36:36.236
and just...

36:36.361 --> 36:37.863
and then I kept looking
at the read-through,

36:37.988 --> 36:40.324
going. "Ch, my god.
It's dying."

36:40.949 --> 36:41.783
[whistling sound]

36:41.909 --> 36:42.951
[explosion]

36:43.702 --> 36:44.745
Bomb.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.289
Then he grabs really hard
when he gets nervous.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.291
"David,
I'm going to get in trouble,"

36:49.416 --> 36:51.752
and then after that,
I would say,

36:52.085 --> 36:53.337
"I'm working
on Puppy Lawyer."

36:53.462 --> 36:55.047
"Your honor, arf arf."

36:55.339 --> 36:57.758
- I think
you see the purest Chris,

36:58.467 --> 37:01.136
um, when we did
the Chris Farley Show.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.890
You see the timidness.
You see the awkwardness.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.223
Somebody didn't write
the character of Chris Farley.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.811
That was Chris Farley.

37:09.937 --> 37:12.105
- It's almost
an impersonator's ability

37:12.231 --> 37:15.317
to pick up on the way the person
talks about themselves

37:15.442 --> 37:16.693
or sees the world,

37:17.319 --> 37:19.321
and heighten it a little bit,

37:19.780 --> 37:21.949
and that was Chris right there.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.659
The Chris Farley Show.

37:23.784 --> 37:25.244
That's how he felt
about the world.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.454
- Welcome
to The Chris Farley Show.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.830
I'm Chris Farley.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.291
- Most regular people relate

37:31.416 --> 37:33.752
to that
being a little star-struck,

37:33.877 --> 37:35.278
and even
when he was a star himself,

37:35.379 --> 37:38.882
I don't think he ever stopped
being kind of awestruck

37:39.007 --> 37:40.259
by celebrities he admired.

37:40.384 --> 37:44.221
- My guest tonight is
one of the greatest musicians...

37:45.472 --> 37:47.057
uh, rock musicians...

37:48.934 --> 37:51.019
I guess, songwriter... ever.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.732
- "You're Paul McCartney."
"Yes."

37:55.857 --> 37:57.776
"And you were the Beatles."

37:58.735 --> 37:59.778
"Yes."

38:00.445 --> 38:02.447
- Remember when you were
with the Beatles?

38:02.572 --> 38:03.907
[audience laughs]

38:04.700 --> 38:05.742
[applause]

38:05.951 --> 38:06.994
- Sure. Sure.

38:08.829 --> 38:10.163
- That was awesome.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.832
[audience laughs]

38:13.000 --> 38:14.501
- Yeah, it was.
Yeah.

38:15.419 --> 38:18.422
- That was a magnified version
of himself,

38:18.630 --> 38:20.382
of his own insecurities,

38:20.507 --> 38:21.925
and you knew when
he was doing those interviews

38:22.050 --> 38:24.136
that was the arc of the sketch,

38:24.511 --> 38:26.847
was we wait
for his falling apart,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.807
because he was "so stupid!"

38:29.891 --> 38:31.476
"Damn it.
Why did I say that?"

38:33.353 --> 38:34.396
- So stupid.

38:34.771 --> 38:35.981
What a dumb question.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.149
- No, no, no.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.483
Chris, I get asked that
all the time in interviews.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.237
- Awkwardly, like,
"I know, I'm an idiot,"

38:42.362 --> 38:44.448
and "Oh, it's so great,
what you do,"

38:44.573 --> 38:47.075
and he kind of felt that way
about almost anybody.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.369
- His self-deprecating manner

38:50.287 --> 38:51.727
was another part
of the vulnerability

38:51.830 --> 38:54.374
that he put in
a lot of the things that he did.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.251
- "And in the end,
the love you take

38:56.376 --> 38:58.462
is equal to the love you make."

38:59.129 --> 39:00.464
You remember that?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.341
[audience laughs]

39:02.632 --> 39:03.675
- Yes.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.720
- Is that true?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.180
[audience laughs]

39:08.388 --> 39:11.058
- All that love
that came out of the guy

39:12.059 --> 39:14.561
was him just apologizing
by nature

39:16.897 --> 39:18.815
for a lot of stuff that <i>he...</i>

39:21.068 --> 39:23.820
I wish he'd never
had to apologize for.

39:23.945 --> 39:24.988
[applause]

39:25.489 --> 39:27.991
- Yes, Chris,
in my experience, it is.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.036
I find the more you give,
the more you get.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.913
- Oh...

39:33.955 --> 39:35.791
Awesome!

39:40.295 --> 39:41.546
- All the stars that would come
on the show,

39:41.671 --> 39:43.423
on Saturday Night Live,
the hosts,

39:43.548 --> 39:45.967
they would just, out loud,
just go, "I love you."

39:46.093 --> 39:47.260
"You're the best."

39:47.552 --> 39:49.346
"I watch the show
because of you," you know.

39:49.471 --> 39:51.264
We'd all be, like,
"That's funny, man.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.808
They all love Farley."

39:52.933 --> 39:55.310
- When Christian Slater came,
he had his hair greased back.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.354
He goes,
"Christian Slater's cool,"

39:57.479 --> 39:59.481
which he said
about every single host.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.316
He started
combing his hair back,

40:01.441 --> 40:02.859
and I go, "Oh, no, no."

40:04.820 --> 40:06.196
"Is it Single White Female?"

40:06.321 --> 40:08.156
He goes, "It's cool, man."

40:08.323 --> 40:09.825
- Every host was like,

40:10.200 --> 40:11.535
"Please put me in a skit
with that guy."

40:11.660 --> 40:13.995
They just loved being around
that energy.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.164
- He was sort of nervous
outward,

40:16.289 --> 40:18.542
so he would try
to show off a lot,

40:18.959 --> 40:20.919
try to be funny all the time,

40:21.044 --> 40:22.504
and that was his way
of flirting.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.089
I remember he was walking
around with a Diet Coke,

40:24.214 --> 40:26.049
and I think Glenn Close
was there, talking,

40:26.174 --> 40:27.300
and I could see him looking,

40:27.426 --> 40:28.986
and she goes, "Well,
talk to you later."

40:29.094 --> 40:29.928
He goes, "Yeah, okay,"
and he goes...

40:30.053 --> 40:31.053
[glugging sounds]

40:31.096 --> 40:32.889
And he chugged the whole Diet...

40:33.014 --> 40:34.349
and she goes, "Okay."

40:34.474 --> 40:36.101
She walked away, and I go,

40:36.226 --> 40:37.602
"Was that...
Are you showing off?"

40:37.727 --> 40:39.604
and he goes, "Yeah,
I chugged the whole thing."

40:39.729 --> 40:41.231
I go, "And who cares?"

40:42.065 --> 40:44.234
and he's like, "Shut up, dude."

40:44.609 --> 40:47.612
- That was, like,
his Achilles' heel, you know.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.239
Any time
you were in front of a girl,

40:49.364 --> 40:50.449
he was very bashful.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.868
- Chris was very attractive
to women, very attractive,

40:52.993 --> 40:56.121
and had some of the most
beautiful women in Hollywood

40:56.246 --> 40:57.831
would come by the set
to visit him

40:57.956 --> 40:59.416
because he was nice to people.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.293
He was nice to everybody.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.421
He was funny, he was sweet,
and he was a gentleman.

41:04.546 --> 41:07.424
- It starts with
that genuine expression,

41:07.549 --> 41:10.635
that sincerity here,
that was so attractive,

41:10.760 --> 41:12.429
and then his power
and his strength.

41:12.554 --> 41:16.141
He had an incredible masculinity
at the same time.

41:16.683 --> 41:20.270
- You know, he's not
your traditional leading man,

41:20.645 --> 41:22.063
you know what I mean,

41:22.397 --> 41:23.440
<i>but it's...</i>

41:24.149 --> 41:25.400
there's no one like him.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.903
And he was infectious,
and he was kind,

41:28.028 --> 41:29.279
and he was a puppy dog.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.240
There was nothing malicious
about him,

41:32.991 --> 41:34.409
arrogant about him.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.203
It was a purity.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.998
- It may not be what you thought
was Ken doll,

41:40.540 --> 41:44.127
but it comes together,
and it's extremely attractive.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.587
- There was probably
a part of him

41:45.712 --> 41:47.255
that always wondered,

41:47.380 --> 41:48.340
"Do these women
want to be with me"

41:48.465 --> 41:49.799
"just because I'm famous,"

41:49.925 --> 41:51.760
"or do they really like me?"

41:52.427 --> 41:54.596
- He was trying to pull out of me
what it was like.

41:54.721 --> 41:55.972
"How does it work with fame?"

41:56.097 --> 41:57.766
"How do you live with fame"

41:58.475 --> 42:00.894
"and have a really good
relationship?"

42:01.019 --> 42:02.938
- I met David Spade in a deli.

42:03.355 --> 42:04.439
He knew who I was

42:04.898 --> 42:07.567
because I was, like,
doing Victoria's Secret.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.611
He heard my voice,
and he started laughing,

42:09.736 --> 42:11.488
and I knew he was laughing
at my voice.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.782
David kept saying,
"You remind me of Chris.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.158
You act like Chris."

42:15.283 --> 42:16.701
I said,
"I want to meet this Chris,"

42:16.826 --> 42:19.746
and he said, "No, because
you'll fall in love with him,"

42:19.871 --> 42:20.914
and, um...

42:21.414 --> 42:22.707
the first time I met him,

42:22.832 --> 42:26.169
I just looked at him and said,
"I love that guy."

42:26.795 --> 42:28.588
And then we just started
hanging out all the time,

42:28.713 --> 42:29.756
you know?

42:30.799 --> 42:33.802
I didn't really know
the goofball so much.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.138
I would see it sometimes,
you know,

42:37.764 --> 42:40.559
but there was just
a whole different side to him

42:40.684 --> 42:43.353
that I thought
was just so beautiful.

42:43.979 --> 42:45.730
It was just so beautiful.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.607
- We'd gone to church together,

42:47.732 --> 42:48.692
and we drove through
a very nice neighborhood.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.236
He said,
"I'd really like to settle here"

42:51.361 --> 42:52.821
"and have a wife
and have children,"

42:52.946 --> 42:54.155
"and raise my family here,"

42:54.281 --> 42:57.284
I think very much similar
to what he had been raised in.

42:57.409 --> 42:59.786
He really longed for that.

43:03.415 --> 43:04.499
- A lot of comics,

43:04.624 --> 43:07.919
they're not really funny
away from performing,

43:08.044 --> 43:09.296
and then a few are,

43:09.754 --> 43:10.964
and he was one of those.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.008
He was very funny off-camera.

43:13.133 --> 43:13.967
As far as, like,

43:14.092 --> 43:15.635
just physically doing
anything for a laugh,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.262
Chris would just...
He'd do anything.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.764
- The funniest thing
that Chris ever did,

43:19.889 --> 43:22.309
and he did it pretty
much every week,

43:22.434 --> 43:23.810
and I always forgot,

43:23.935 --> 43:25.729
so I had, like,
an insane routine down.

43:25.854 --> 43:27.981
I'd go to the upper deck
outside of Lorne's office

43:28.106 --> 43:29.524
and watch the musical acts,

43:29.649 --> 43:30.649
because I knew

43:30.650 --> 43:32.652
that I would never have a chance
again in my life

43:32.777 --> 43:35.488
to see
so many fantastic musical acts,

43:35.614 --> 43:37.657
and then I would go
and have a shower

43:37.782 --> 43:39.534
at exactly the same time,

43:40.368 --> 43:43.163
and Chris,
every time I was in the shower,

43:43.288 --> 43:44.623
would rip the curtain back.

43:44.748 --> 43:46.291
I'd be completely naked.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.543
He would tuck everything and go,

43:48.668 --> 43:50.754
"Michael, I love you so much,"

43:51.796 --> 43:53.965
and he would pin me
against the wall in the shower,

43:54.090 --> 43:57.218
and I would whale on him
like this, just whale on him,

43:57.344 --> 43:59.304
like, "Get off me. Get off me."

43:59.429 --> 44:00.847
"Just give me one kiss, Michael.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.307
I love you so much."

44:02.682 --> 44:04.601
It was the most frightening
thing in the world,

44:04.726 --> 44:07.562
and it killed me every time,
and I forgot every week,

44:07.687 --> 44:08.687
because you would think

44:08.730 --> 44:09.564
that's not something
you'd forget,

44:09.689 --> 44:11.775
and every time, I'd go,
"Oh, god, of course.

44:11.900 --> 44:15.737
I should have my shower at home,
not at work."

44:17.030 --> 44:18.073
- My daughter asked me

44:18.198 --> 44:21.409
what was the best thing
I've ever done in show business,

44:21.534 --> 44:22.577
and I said,

44:23.119 --> 44:24.162
"On stage,"

44:24.704 --> 44:27.290
"doing 'Motivational Speaker'
with Chris Farley"

44:27.415 --> 44:28.415
"eight times a week,"

44:28.500 --> 44:29.542
"no question,"

44:30.251 --> 44:32.754
and nothing
will ever come close.

44:33.672 --> 44:35.048
- Let's get better acquainted

44:35.173 --> 44:37.634
by letting me give you
a little bit of a scenario

44:37.759 --> 44:39.636
of what my life is all about.

44:39.761 --> 44:42.514
- At Second City,
people would come in,

44:42.681 --> 44:45.684
like, waiters and waitresses,
bartenders, staff,

44:45.809 --> 44:47.686
that would come in
at, like, 9:18,

44:47.811 --> 44:49.562
because they knew
that's about the time

44:49.688 --> 44:51.731
"Motivational Speaker"
was coming on at Second City.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.858
- First off, I am 35 years old.

44:54.192 --> 44:55.235
I am divorced,

44:55.902 --> 44:58.405
and I live in a van
down by the river.

44:59.489 --> 45:02.742
- He had done some speech
in kind of that voice.

45:04.536 --> 45:05.995
- Bob Odenkirk and everyone else
recognized

45:06.121 --> 45:08.415
that they had to do something
with this character.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.750
It was just too compelling
and funny.

45:10.875 --> 45:11.918
- It was so fun.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.963
He pushed it, and he broke you,

45:15.755 --> 45:17.257
and did it every time.

45:17.674 --> 45:18.717
It was insane.

45:19.467 --> 45:20.510
- Probably going to go out there
and say,

45:20.635 --> 45:22.637
"Hey, I'm going to take
the world by the tail,"

45:22.762 --> 45:25.807
"wrap it around, pull it down,
and put it in my pocket."

45:25.932 --> 45:28.184
- I thought, "What if the guy
is using himself"

45:28.309 --> 45:30.562
"as an example
of why not to do it,"

45:30.687 --> 45:32.731
"because of 'Look at me.
Look where I am.' "

45:32.856 --> 45:35.024
He is still the worst example.

45:37.777 --> 45:40.238
I mean, the sketch
has great structure to it,

45:40.363 --> 45:41.448
but the fact is,

45:42.282 --> 45:45.910
it's a framework for this
insanely wonderful performance.

45:46.035 --> 45:48.163
- You're not going
to amount to jack squat!

45:48.288 --> 45:49.288
[audience laughs]

45:50.665 --> 45:52.751
- It was a grand slam
every single fucking time.

45:52.876 --> 45:54.127
It was nuts, nuts.

45:54.711 --> 45:56.231
- As I told you,
my name is Matt Foley,

45:56.337 --> 45:58.131
and I am a motivational speaker.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.841
[audience laughs]

46:02.635 --> 46:04.179
- Chris, when he did it,

46:04.304 --> 46:06.639
was doing his dad
<i>as</i> a character,

46:07.223 --> 46:08.266
<i>and his dad...</i>

46:08.808 --> 46:10.643
great guy, but when he got mad,

46:10.769 --> 46:13.521
he, like,
transcended a scream level,

46:13.772 --> 46:15.690
scarier-sounding pocket,

46:16.649 --> 46:18.735
and it was more like, you know,

46:19.778 --> 46:23.072
"Christopher, I am not going
to tell you again."

46:23.198 --> 46:25.909
- Dad, I wish you could just shut
your big yapper!

46:26.034 --> 46:28.411
- Then we'd played rugby
with a guy, Larry Hill,

46:28.536 --> 46:30.663
he kind of ran
on the outside of his feet,

46:30.789 --> 46:32.290
so he would kind <i>of...</i>

46:32.957 --> 46:35.001
Larry would play rugby
like this,

46:35.126 --> 46:36.878
so he's there doing Larry,

46:37.003 --> 46:38.922
going,
"What we're going to do..."

46:39.047 --> 46:42.550
- Young lady, what do you want
to do with your life?

46:43.843 --> 46:45.887
- He took
what he loved about them

46:46.012 --> 46:47.347
and made it his own.

46:48.723 --> 46:50.058
- You're telling me
there's a real Matt Foley?

46:50.183 --> 46:52.936
I did not know that.
I did not know that.

46:53.853 --> 46:55.693
It's someone's unfortunate
position to be like,

46:55.814 --> 46:57.565
"Oh, well, I'm on TV now."

46:58.525 --> 46:59.818
- I am the Matt Foley.

46:59.943 --> 47:01.402
It's the height of my career,

47:01.528 --> 47:02.849
living in a van
down by the river.

47:02.946 --> 47:04.906
Caught a lot of questions
in the last <i>25</i> years

47:05.031 --> 47:06.074
about that.

47:06.699 --> 47:10.078
- He would often name or re-name
his characters at Second City

47:10.203 --> 47:12.831
after friends that he would spot
in the audience,

47:12.956 --> 47:14.791
and in that case,
the name just stuck.

47:14.916 --> 47:16.751
- Then he comes out,
"My name is Matt Foley,"

47:16.876 --> 47:18.127
and does that bit,

47:18.294 --> 47:20.922
and I just kind of sunk down
in my chair a little bit,

47:21.047 --> 47:23.341
and said, "Oh, my god,
where's this going?"

47:23.466 --> 47:26.052
- He told him, apparently,
"I'm never changing the name."

47:26.177 --> 47:27.679
You know.
"I'm keeping it."

47:27.804 --> 47:29.244
"He's always going
to be Matt Foley."

47:29.264 --> 47:31.182
- We're going to be buddies!

47:31.349 --> 47:32.642
We're going to be pals!

47:32.767 --> 47:34.435
We're going to wrestle!

47:35.144 --> 47:36.145
- I was humbled.

47:36.271 --> 47:37.831
It was a wonderful,
wonderful expression

47:37.856 --> 47:39.357
of our relationship,

47:39.899 --> 47:43.736
but my little slice of notoriety
was well appreciated,

47:43.862 --> 47:46.030
and I give thanks to him
every day for that.

47:46.155 --> 47:48.741
- I'm living in a van
down by the river!

47:48.867 --> 47:50.743
- You didn't often
see Second City scenes

47:50.869 --> 47:53.538
brought fully formed
to SNL that way.

47:54.205 --> 47:57.959
- He just had this thing wired
and perfected from Second City,

47:58.084 --> 48:00.086
so once
he even did a read-through,

48:00.211 --> 48:01.211
everyone loved it.

48:01.254 --> 48:02.839
- Your father and I came up
with a brilliant idea

48:02.964 --> 48:04.924
to give you kids
some direction...

48:05.049 --> 48:06.801
A motivational speaker.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.887
- Yeah, it was
Christina Applegate,

48:09.012 --> 48:10.430
and she was the host.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.141
- And I remember Lorne Michaels
saying to me,

48:13.266 --> 48:14.934
apologetic in a way, like,

48:15.059 --> 48:16.144
"He has this character"

48:16.269 --> 48:18.104
"he's really been wanting
to do on the show."

48:18.229 --> 48:19.981
"We're not sure what it is."

48:20.899 --> 48:23.902
"Do you mind if we premiere it
in your episode?"

48:24.027 --> 48:26.821
and I was like, "Well, yeah,
of course," you know.

48:26.946 --> 48:28.531
"Let's see what it is."

48:28.781 --> 48:30.700
- Matt, we're ready for you.

48:30.992 --> 48:32.702
- Out comes Chris
out of that door.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.913
- All right, how's everybody?

48:35.872 --> 48:38.166
Now, let's get started
by letting me give you

48:38.291 --> 48:42.045
a little bit of a scenario
of what my life is all about.

48:42.962 --> 48:44.881
First off, I am 35 years old.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.343
I am divorced,

48:49.177 --> 48:51.679
and I live
in a van down by the river.

48:52.597 --> 48:53.932
[audience laughs]

48:54.515 --> 48:56.434
- He'd combine
the scratchy voice,

48:56.559 --> 48:58.394
move his glasses around,
he can't see,

48:58.519 --> 48:59.854
and then grabs his belt,

48:59.979 --> 49:00.939
or when he's sideways to you,

49:01.064 --> 49:02.864
he crosses his eyes
so the audience can't see,

49:02.982 --> 49:04.609
try new tricks, and he'd just...

49:04.734 --> 49:05.777
"Huh? Huh?"

49:06.653 --> 49:07.779
- Okay, I'm going to go out

49:07.904 --> 49:10.406
and I'm going to get the world
by the tail,

49:10.531 --> 49:12.241
and wrap it around
and pull it down

49:12.367 --> 49:13.826
and put it in my pocket.

49:13.952 --> 49:15.954
- We all just kind of stopped.

49:16.287 --> 49:17.455
What is going on?

49:18.164 --> 49:18.998
And it just, the...

49:19.123 --> 49:21.042
"Doo, doo,
on the right track."

49:21.167 --> 49:23.878
- How can we get back
on the right track?

49:24.003 --> 49:25.338
[audience laughs]

49:26.130 --> 49:28.049
- Bigger, and more crazy,
and we just... that was it.

49:28.174 --> 49:29.467
- When Chris did Matt Foley,

49:29.592 --> 49:32.095
he tried to make everyone
crack up.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.472
- Well, la-Di-frickin'-da.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.642
[audience laughs]

49:38.059 --> 49:40.061
We've got ourselves
a writer here.

49:40.186 --> 49:41.396
- I think just the combo

49:41.521 --> 49:44.023
of watching the audience
see it for the first time

49:44.148 --> 49:46.067
and realizing
this is such a funny thing,

49:46.192 --> 49:47.944
and we'd seen it all week.

49:48.152 --> 49:50.071
I started thinking
it was funnier again.

49:50.196 --> 49:52.365
- Ol' Matt's going
to be your shadow.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.200
Here's you, here's Matt.

49:54.325 --> 49:55.159
There's you, there's...

49:55.284 --> 49:56.284
[Crash]

49:56.369 --> 49:58.121
[audience laughs, applauds]

50:00.707 --> 50:01.833
Whoops-a-daisy.

50:01.958 --> 50:03.001
- You could see me,
I'm hiding behind my hair

50:03.126 --> 50:03.960
because I knew

50:04.085 --> 50:06.087
that if I looked at him
for one second more,

50:06.212 --> 50:08.631
I was going to drop
off that couch.

50:10.049 --> 50:11.592
I couldn't even get my line out.

50:11.718 --> 50:13.158
I knew that,
"Okay, I have one line."

50:13.219 --> 50:14.971
- What do you want
to do with your life?

50:15.096 --> 50:16.931
- "I want to live in a van
down by the river."

50:17.056 --> 50:19.642
It's the only joke I had
in the whole thing,

50:19.767 --> 50:21.894
and I just was like...
[whispers]

50:22.020 --> 50:24.856
- I want to live in a van
down by the river.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.983
- "I want to live in a van
down by the river,"

50:27.108 --> 50:28.776
and I just put my head
back down.

50:28.901 --> 50:29.944
- Well,
you'll have plenty of time

50:30.069 --> 50:32.697
to live in a van
down by the river when...

50:32.822 --> 50:35.658
you're living
in a van down by the river!

50:35.992 --> 50:38.661
- You can't design it
in a laboratory,

50:39.120 --> 50:41.956
but "I live in a van
down by the river..."

50:43.124 --> 50:45.460
The first time I heard that,
I was like, "Hm."

50:45.585 --> 50:47.378
"That's yummy. I know that one."

50:47.503 --> 50:51.007
- He made my whole body
go into convulsions of joy.

50:52.884 --> 50:54.927
- And I was more scared
of getting in trouble.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.095
I did not want
to get yelled at by Lorne.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.061
I didn't want one more reason
to get rid of me.

50:58.097 --> 50:59.682
- From what I've heard,

50:59.932 --> 51:02.018
you're using your paper
not for writing,

51:02.143 --> 51:03.895
but for rolling doobies.

51:05.521 --> 51:08.941
You're going to be doing
a lot of doobie-rolling

51:09.108 --> 51:12.278
when you're living in a van
down by the river.

51:13.071 --> 51:14.530
- It just was thrilling.

51:14.655 --> 51:15.698
It was...

51:16.157 --> 51:18.159
it was like watching
Evel Knievel, you know.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.078
You just kind of
couldn't believe it.

51:20.203 --> 51:21.162
- We knew
that we were in the presence

51:21.287 --> 51:23.081
of something
that was pretty great.

51:23.206 --> 51:24.957
I don't think any of us,
on that day,

51:25.083 --> 51:26.084
knew that "Motivational Speaker"

51:26.209 --> 51:29.587
was going to become such
an iconic character for him.

51:29.712 --> 51:31.672
It was an incredible moment,
though.

51:31.798 --> 51:34.175
It was pretty cool
to see that happen.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.470
- I don't give a rat's behind,
because I'm moving in.

51:37.595 --> 51:41.349
I'm sick and tired of living
in a van down by the river!

51:42.141 --> 51:43.184
[applause]

51:43.768 --> 51:44.977
- I mean, he lit up a room,

51:45.103 --> 51:46.562
and Chris did everything
to excess.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.064
He was your friend to excess.

51:48.189 --> 51:49.482
He loved you to excess.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.109
He was kind to excess.

51:51.234 --> 51:54.570
But when it came to, you know,
drinking and other stuff,

51:54.695 --> 51:55.988
Chris got caught in a world

51:56.114 --> 51:57.990
that I don't know
if he could get out of.

51:58.116 --> 51:59.575
- Chris was one
of Lorne's favorite performers,

51:59.700 --> 52:00.993
and one of his favorite men,

52:01.119 --> 52:03.496
and truly, truly loved him.

52:05.164 --> 52:07.041
Lorne was never concerned
about, you know,

52:07.166 --> 52:10.169
<i>assisting Chris
in his artistic ability.</i>

52:11.254 --> 52:13.256
He was more concerned
about the lifestyle.

52:13.381 --> 52:15.341
- There was some part of him
that clearly trusted

52:15.466 --> 52:18.052
that if he was
a little bit fucked up,

52:19.095 --> 52:22.098
that it would be all right,
or that it would be...

52:22.223 --> 52:24.475
maybe that was
where the magic came from.

52:24.600 --> 52:25.434
- Chris and Lorne

52:25.560 --> 52:27.645
had a father-figure
kind of a relationship.

52:27.770 --> 52:29.211
Lorne was always worried
about Chris,

52:29.272 --> 52:31.691
and he looked out for Chris
a lot, you know.

52:31.816 --> 52:34.360
Lorne was very good to Chris,
and Chris looked up to Lorne.

52:38.698 --> 52:39.991
- When he got to SNL,

52:40.116 --> 52:43.202
whatever track he was on
<i>as</i> far as, you know,

52:43.953 --> 52:45.163
any drinking
or anything like that,

52:45.288 --> 52:47.123
that was just sort of
set in line,

52:47.248 --> 52:49.083
and so all the wheels
were in motion

52:49.208 --> 52:51.586
by the time we got to him,
you know.

52:51.711 --> 52:53.087
It's just hard to deal with,

52:53.212 --> 52:55.464
and not everyone's that stable.

52:56.174 --> 52:59.302
I'm not, and it's very hard.

53:02.430 --> 53:04.348
- So many comedians
have low self-esteem,

53:04.473 --> 53:07.226
feeling like, "Well,
if I'm not making people laugh,"

53:07.351 --> 53:09.729
"do I really deserve to be here?"

53:11.230 --> 53:13.900
- But he was this boy
who wanted to do good.

53:14.025 --> 53:15.735
He wanted to impress his dad
and his mom

53:15.860 --> 53:17.445
and his family so much,

53:18.279 --> 53:20.448
but then there was
this other side of him,

53:20.573 --> 53:23.159
so his whole life
was this constant battle.

53:23.284 --> 53:26.579
- You know, bars filled
from ceiling to cash register

53:26.704 --> 53:27.747
full of booze,

53:28.372 --> 53:29.540
and he goes, "Johnny,
don't you ever look at that"

53:29.665 --> 53:31.083
"and just want to drink"

53:31.209 --> 53:33.961
"every single drop
of all that stuff right there?"

53:34.086 --> 53:35.171
and I go, "Nope,"

53:35.838 --> 53:38.674
"it didn't really
enter my mind, Chris."

53:40.301 --> 53:42.136
- He was a very sweet guy...

53:42.511 --> 53:43.763
before midnight.

53:46.015 --> 53:48.684
He was as open
and like a six-year-old

53:50.061 --> 53:51.103
as he was dark,

53:52.313 --> 53:54.607
and the darkness was compelling,

53:54.732 --> 53:58.069
but not something
you want to really be around.

53:59.111 --> 54:01.197
- When he would get
super messed up,

54:01.322 --> 54:02.240
he would pull away a little bit.

54:02.365 --> 54:05.284
"Everybody's on my ass.
I want to be by myself."

54:05.409 --> 54:06.953
"I've got the exact drugs
I'm going to do,"

54:07.078 --> 54:08.638
"and then
I'm going to get it together,"

54:08.704 --> 54:09.914
which is not the way it goes.

54:10.039 --> 54:11.332
The way it goes
is you get messed up,

54:11.457 --> 54:14.961
then you really, you know,
you call your buddies.

54:15.419 --> 54:19.090
- When you're jumping up steps
in the showbiz ladder

54:21.259 --> 54:23.302
and you're leaping
over everyone around you,

54:23.427 --> 54:25.680
and everyone around you
is going,

54:25.805 --> 54:27.640
"You'd better watch out,"

54:27.974 --> 54:30.226
some part of you
has to be going,

54:31.018 --> 54:32.478
"No, you'd better watch out,"

54:32.603 --> 54:35.189
"because I'm kicking ass
every day."

54:35.356 --> 54:37.275
- I kind of grabbed him once,

54:37.525 --> 54:40.444
and I just took him,
just with all my might,

54:40.569 --> 54:42.029
I just took him
behind this curtain

54:42.154 --> 54:43.281
at an after-thing,

54:43.406 --> 54:45.449
and I said,
"Dude, what the fuck?"

54:45.574 --> 54:46.617
"Seriously?"

54:47.118 --> 54:48.369
And he'd get very,

54:48.494 --> 54:51.247
"Michael, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

54:51.372 --> 54:54.083
You're right, you're right,
you're right."

54:54.208 --> 54:56.752
I said, "Seriously, dude,
what the fuck," you know?

54:56.877 --> 54:58.004
- There came a point,

54:58.129 --> 55:00.506
certainly there came a point
in his story

55:00.631 --> 55:02.216
where he gave credence

55:02.508 --> 55:05.177
to everyone's warnings
and worries.

55:05.344 --> 55:07.555
- The thing he loved the most
was doing the show,

55:07.680 --> 55:09.348
so taking it away from him,

55:09.473 --> 55:12.226
we sent him
to a very sort of tough place

55:15.438 --> 55:17.106
in the South,
I think in Alabama,

55:17.231 --> 55:19.942
and that period
was really hard for him,

55:20.067 --> 55:21.360
but I think it also...

55:21.485 --> 55:23.404
he came back
much clearer and determined

55:23.529 --> 55:26.198
that that was never
going to happen again.

55:26.324 --> 55:27.783
- Hey, girls.
Did I miss anything?

55:27.908 --> 55:28.951
[applause]

55:30.036 --> 55:32.788
- Nothing.
Chrissy's being stupid again.

55:32.913 --> 55:33.956
- [giggles]

55:34.415 --> 55:36.500
- Oh, god, I love these fries.

55:37.376 --> 55:39.457
- If you love them so much,
why don't you marry them?

55:39.462 --> 55:40.504
[laughs]

55:41.172 --> 55:42.256
Can I have some?

55:43.341 --> 55:45.259
- Um, sure, Cindy, go ahead.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.428
- Oh, god, these are good.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.056
- Uh, Cindy,
can you leave some for us?

55:50.181 --> 55:51.223
- [laughs]

55:51.849 --> 55:54.477
- I thought you were, um,
trying to lose weight.

55:54.602 --> 55:56.896
- [deep voice] Lay off me,
I'm starving.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.564
[applause]

56:00.775 --> 56:01.817
[giggles]

56:02.735 --> 56:04.153
Diet starts Monday.

56:05.905 --> 56:08.025
- There was this steak joint
called "the Steak Joint,"

56:08.115 --> 56:11.243
and they had this thing called
the Trenchman's Cut, which...

56:11.369 --> 56:13.537
This thing was probably
this big and this wide,

56:13.662 --> 56:14.705
roast beef,

56:14.914 --> 56:16.082
and I'd be, like,

56:16.207 --> 56:17.958
"How are you going to eat that
and go on stage?"

56:18.084 --> 56:19.919
He'd be like, "I can do it."

56:20.544 --> 56:22.505
We'd all be like, "Go, go, go."

56:22.630 --> 56:24.882
- Oh, look, Tammy,
it's the Gap girls,

56:25.007 --> 56:26.007
and they're eating.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.176
What a surprise.

56:27.760 --> 56:28.928
- You're so dumb,

56:29.470 --> 56:31.722
when they were passing out
brains,

56:31.847 --> 56:34.016
you thought they said "trains,"

56:34.141 --> 56:36.894
<i>and then... you got on it...
on</i> a <i>train,</i>

56:37.770 --> 56:39.438
and then went for a ride.

56:40.022 --> 56:41.065
[applause]

56:43.734 --> 56:45.277
- Two rib-eyes, medium...

56:45.403 --> 56:47.196
and I'm not exaggerating,
I'm not trying to be funny,

56:47.321 --> 56:48.864
he'd taken the rib-eyes,

56:48.989 --> 56:50.032
he'd kind of put it in his mouth

56:50.157 --> 56:51.158
and stripped it,
kind of, almost...

56:51.283 --> 56:53.077
like a sparerib or something.

56:53.202 --> 56:54.078
And I look over at the plate,

56:54.203 --> 56:55.204
and both the rib-eyes
are gone.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.622
Later on, we were walking,

56:56.747 --> 56:59.542
and I said, "Those steaks,
the way you ate that..."

56:59.667 --> 57:02.420
and he says, "I know. I know.
What am I doing?"

57:02.545 --> 57:04.380
and whenever he said
"What am I doing?"

57:04.505 --> 57:05.381
you knew
that he knew everything.

57:05.506 --> 57:06.507
He knew everything
about himself.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.926
Nothing was, like,
sneaking past him.

57:09.051 --> 57:10.094
It just seemed

57:10.511 --> 57:11.512
like there was always something
massive that he was doing,

57:11.637 --> 57:13.431
something big, something huge.

57:13.556 --> 57:15.891
- Jeez, those two
are always OTR.

57:17.560 --> 57:18.602
- [gasps]

57:18.811 --> 57:20.312
You two are terrible!

57:20.896 --> 57:21.939
[giggling]

57:22.398 --> 57:24.442
- Sometimes he would head-butt me
in sketches,

57:24.567 --> 57:27.069
get so close
it would throw you off,

57:27.486 --> 57:30.448
like "What's going... you're
not supposed to do that."

57:30.573 --> 57:32.241
So that was funny,
and he liked it,

57:32.366 --> 57:35.703
and he'd go "I made you laugh,"
and get excited,

57:36.328 --> 57:37.371
like a child.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.081
- I'll tell you
what he never did.

57:39.206 --> 57:40.583
He didn't make it about himself.

57:40.708 --> 57:43.794
Never sat back
and was cocky about killing.

57:44.545 --> 57:47.548
His laughs were so huge
and thick and long,

57:48.924 --> 57:50.092
the giant roars,

57:50.634 --> 57:52.678
I'd say,
"Did you hear how you...?"

57:52.803 --> 57:54.524
He'd be like, "Really?
Really? It was good?"

57:54.555 --> 57:56.515
If I had some of those roars,
I would definitely

57:56.640 --> 57:59.477
have a lot more of an attitude
right now.

57:59.727 --> 58:01.395
I don't think
I'd be hanging out with you.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.105
- The world of high fashion...

58:03.230 --> 58:05.608
There was never anyone
like Dante.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.489
- These designs are atrocious.

58:12.198 --> 58:13.949
Are you trying to ruin me?

58:14.700 --> 58:16.327
- I shared an office that year,

58:16.452 --> 58:18.996
10 feet wide
with just two wooden desks.

58:19.121 --> 58:20.164
- Oh, Dante...

58:20.789 --> 58:21.832
- I sat there.

58:22.041 --> 58:23.292
Behind me was him.

58:23.709 --> 58:26.212
- That's the third assistant
you've fired this month.

58:26.337 --> 58:27.838
- I had to write my own stuff,
which was tough.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.382
He didn't write or read
or really do anything,

58:30.508 --> 58:33.552
but he was funny,
and that was more important.

58:35.095 --> 58:38.933
- I'll have not have
my decisions questioned, Lucien.

58:40.726 --> 58:42.520
In bed, you're my partner,

58:42.645 --> 58:45.147
but in this office,
you work for me.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.861
- But, Dante...
[laughs]

58:51.529 --> 58:52.571
- Go away.

58:54.490 --> 58:56.411
- Chris Rock and Sandler
had to walk through ours

58:56.492 --> 58:57.868
to get to their little office,

58:57.993 --> 58:59.995
so they would come in and out,

59:00.496 --> 59:01.497
and then
when they locked their door,

59:01.622 --> 59:03.457
you know they're starting
to write hard...

59:03.582 --> 59:05.376
especially Sandler wrote a lot.

59:05.501 --> 59:08.754
- He was a really giving guy
to the other comedians.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.631
Loved the other comedians,

59:10.756 --> 59:13.008
and if you made Farley laugh,
my god, that felt good,

59:13.133 --> 59:14.677
with that giant laugh of his.

59:14.802 --> 59:16.679
- Okay, I've got a package here
for Dante.

59:16.804 --> 59:17.846
- I am Dante.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.015
- All right, here you go.

59:20.516 --> 59:21.559
Sign on the X.

59:22.059 --> 59:23.102
- There.

59:23.727 --> 59:27.314
I'll sign your precious
Federal Express receipt,

59:27.856 --> 59:30.442
and now I wish
you could do me a favor

59:30.693 --> 59:31.735
and buzz off.

59:32.152 --> 59:33.195
- Oh, man.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.114
- There you go.
Excellent!

59:35.239 --> 59:36.282
[cackles]

59:37.116 --> 59:38.116
All right.

59:39.868 --> 59:41.203
- Peekaboo, Dante.

59:42.788 --> 59:45.708
- I was playing
some overly fey character

59:46.709 --> 59:50.212
in the designing
of clothes industry, I believe.

59:50.713 --> 59:53.882
- Well, well, well,
if it isn't Taylor Evans.

59:55.718 --> 59:58.304
If you've come looking
for modeling work,

59:58.429 --> 59:59.763
you're out of luck.

59:59.888 --> 01:00:02.641
I don't let whores
walk down my runway.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:06.729
- Charming as always, Dante,

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:10.024
but I don't intend to take "no"
for an answer.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:13.819
- Well, then, perhaps
you'll take this for an answer.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:14.987
- "Now go!"

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.865
And then at one point,

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:20.701
there was
a little fluffa happened.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.245
There was
a line that got skipped,

01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:26.248
and I just, like,
pushed his glasses up,

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:28.626
and his eyes crossed.

01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:34.673
It was this delicate moment
that made me very happy.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.926
- I have grown wise
to your trickery, Dante.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:42.306
- He came from that background
where you pull everybody up,

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:43.671
that you're there for everybody.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.392
You don't leave anybody hanging,

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:46.477
so when you're working with him,

01:00:46.602 --> 01:00:49.438
he was just right there
and helping you.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:53.442
"Come on, buddy," you know,
that kind of thing.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:56.195
- I was very influenced
by his commitment,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.072
full, all his molecules,

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.867
and anybody around him's
molecules,

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.577
into his performance.

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.914
- So powerful and so ungoverned,

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:09.667
and that was a big part
of, I think, you know,

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:10.626
Chris's appeal.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:13.504
You always had the
sense that he was...

01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:16.924
he was having
the most fun possible.

01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:20.469
- Why, it seems the liposuction
done on your face

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.596
has clogged your eardrums.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.265
Make like an egg, and beat it.

01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:27.935
- It's a word
I wouldn't normally use,

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.771
but there was something
always dutiful about him.

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:32.606
He cared about the whole show.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:36.652
He never fought for his piece
over someone else's piece.

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:39.363
He was most comfortable
being part of it

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:41.281
and caring about it.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.870
- Chris said,
"I want to become so famous"

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:51.291
"that I can go
to children's hospitals"

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:54.962
"and I can cheer the kids up,
and they'll know who I am."

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:57.881
Not a Ferrari, not mansions,
not go to Europe.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.049
That's it.

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:00.718
Like,
that kind of summed up Chris.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:03.679
- Chris walks
into St. Jude's Hospital.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.181
Within 60 seconds
of being in that kid's room,

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.349
they don't care who he is.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:08.715
They don't care about his fame.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.568
They just know
they're madly in love with him.

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.521
And he picks up an IV
and goes, 'Urrr, '

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.939
makes believe he's drinking.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:16.608
The kid doesn't care
about show business.

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.068
It's not Tom Brady.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.403
It's Chris.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.703
- Chris was a real Catholic
in the best sense,

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.824
not in a casual passing sense.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.951
He lived it.
He walked the walk.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.829
He went and visited people
on weekends

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:30.706
and didn't even tell anybody
about it, like,

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:32.708
to bring them meals
or make them laugh.

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:34.626
- His dad told him
a long time ago,

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.795
"Only by the grace of God go I,"

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.672
so he saw those
that were most vulnerable,

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.716
and he saw how blessed he was

01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:43.969
and recognized
that those people, I think,

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:46.138
he related to best.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:49.016
- The acts of kindness
that he did off-camera,

01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:52.644
which were true acts
of sort of piety and modesty,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.524
that part of him
I don't think people knew.

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:58.692
- We would go
by a homeless person

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.487
and I'd go,
"Uh, I don't have anything,"

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:02.654
and Chris goes,

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.865
"What if we just passed
Jesus Christ?"

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.492
"You know, they say he could
come back as a homeless man"

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:07.617
"or something."

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:09.328
"Maybe he's testing us."

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.790
- Kevin Nealon and Mike Myers
and Adam Sandler and David Spade

01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:14.291
were all sitting around,

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.293
and someone says, "How big
do you think you're going to be"

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:17.586
"as a performer?"

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.797
And it went around the room,
and they were all going, like,

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:21.715
"I don't know.
I'll be pretty big, I guess."

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.467
"I don't know.
I'm pretty funny."

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:24.760
"I think I'll do fine,"

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:25.969
and everyone kind of leaves,
you know,

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.387
and it's just Chris and I
were left in the room there,

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:28.931
you know, and I go, "Really?"

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.098
"Yeah ."

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:31.350
"Really,
that's what you think?"

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.684
and he looked around, waited
for them to be out of earshot,

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.853
and then he goes,
"I'm going to be so huge."

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.897
"Oh, my god,
I'm going to be so huge."

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:38.357
"I'm going to be a giant star."

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.650
- Let me tell you something.

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:41.693
On that program,
no offense to anybody else,

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:44.404
you're the life of the party,
buddy.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.073
[audience cheers]

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.950
- Scripts are coming in.
You're reading constantly.

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.868
You're trying to figure out
what are the best moves.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.113
I always call it the ride,
where the ride is headed up

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.455
and the trajectory
is straight up,

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.873
and that's where Chris was.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.043
- I was there when Lorne
was developing Chris as a talent

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:01.088
and then breaking him out
<i>as</i> a movie star.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.382
- When we were shooting
Wayne's World,

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:04.883
Chris was in it for one scene.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.426
He played the security guard,

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.220
and Mike and Dana
were, you know,

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.721
at the top of their game.

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:10.722
- I remember on Wayne's World,

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:13.267
he turned to me
and said, "How am I doing?"

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:14.560
"Is it going well?"

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:15.811
I said, "Yeah, it's going well."

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:16.937
I said, "I'd just like
to point out, Chris,"

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:17.938
"that this is my first movie."

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.065
"I've actually never even
been in a movie."

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.860
"This is my absolute first movie,
so I'm..."

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:26.321
"Well, you seem so at home
and seem so natural,"

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.240
and I said, "It's not."

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:29.575
"I'm terrified,"

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.160
"and I have no idea
what I'm doing."

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:34.121
- He was so sweet in Coneheads
and wonderful,

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.957
and just to be on the set
with him was great.

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:39.751
- Chris was the romantic lead.

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:44.882
- When you first sign somebody
as an agent,

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:47.007
you want to introduce them
to everybody in the town

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.931
who can make a difference
in their movie career.

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:50.554
First of all, he wore
the same thing to every meeting,

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:54.933
which was a button-down white
tearaway SNL wardrobe shirt,

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:56.810
so it would have
the buttons down,

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:58.979
but underneath it was Velcro...

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.607
and he wore that probably
three or four days in a row.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:02.774
- All right.

01:05:02.983 --> 01:05:04.484
- [laughs]
It's a clip-on.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:05.652
- Are you sure?

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:06.945
All right, now...

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.322
- Wayne's World, the Coneheads,

01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:10.688
all of those little cameos,
we can call them, that he did

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:11.909
were getting him
more and more notice.

01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:14.953
It was still very much
within the SNL family,

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.039
and Billy Madison
was Adam saying, you know,

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:18.832
"I want Chris
to play this part."

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:23.003
- Everybody on?
Good. Great.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.463
Grand! Wonderful!

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:27.382
No yelling on the bus!

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.344
Hey!
[tires screeching]

01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:31.762
- You laugh at the fact

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.207
that this guy's
been through hell,

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:36.016
and he's handling it
to the best he can,

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.352
and he's still lovable.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.897
- I'll turn this damn bus
around.

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:44.524
That'll end
your precious little field trip

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.318
pretty damn quick, huh?

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.030
Shit.

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:53.909
- That was bananas.

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:55.327
We don't even know
what the hell happened to him.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.787
He turned dark red,

01:05:57.037 --> 01:05:59.706
and I remember having to cut
around literally every take.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:00.958
Like, it would be like,

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:03.168
"I think we've got three frames
before Adam laughed there,"

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.836
"so maybe we can use that shot
right there."

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:06.672
It was hard to cut around,
but he was nuts.

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:07.798
He was nuts.

01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:09.925
He was so loose
as the bus driver.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.636
- All of these guys
tend to work together

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:13.971
and collaborate.

01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:16.348
The environment there
just breeds friendship.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.683
- Everyone knew he had talent,

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:19.601
and everyone wanted him
in their movie,

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.103
and he was riding high.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:24.022
It was nice to see him just
kind of rolling, doing well.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.147
He started wearing suits.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.442
He'd go down
to the Rochester Big and Tall

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.236
and buy, like, 10 suits,

01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:31.071
and he'd slick his hair back,

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.823
and I'm like, "Who's this guy?"

01:06:32.948 --> 01:06:34.741
"What are you, a Hollywood guy?"

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:35.867
But it was fun.
It was fun to see.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:37.744
- It was cool to see the man

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:42.290
driving up in, like,
a convertible Caddy or something

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:45.210
and just having huge money
and tipping people

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:49.006
and just being like
what you expect he would be.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.176
- He loved to be an actor.
He just loved it.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.970
He loved every minute of it,
you know,

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:56.763
and so he was just happy,

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.141
just having a good time,
killing it.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:02.644
- In Hollywood in the old days,
they used to call it "it,"

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:03.769
when someone had "it."

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:04.938
They didn't know
how to describe it either,

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.107
so they called it "it,"
and he had "it."

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:08.672
- The pressure
of Saturday Night Live

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:09.943
is once you get the show,

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:11.309
everyone's looking at you like,

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:13.697
"Oh, you have a chance
to do movies and be famous

01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:15.115
and be a movie star."

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.034
- First of all, to get a movie,
that's the hustle.

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:18.827
You have to be able
to get in the movie,

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.162
and Chris got in the movie,

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:23.123
and the movie
that he got in was Tommy Boy.

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.086
- Aah!

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.297
- I've got
to go to the bathroom, Daddy.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:32.132
[music] Maniac... [music]

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:34.760
Aah!

01:07:35.469 --> 01:07:37.304
- If you mention Tommy Boy,

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:39.723
80% of the people go
"Fat guy in a little coat"

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.017
because of the way
Chris did it, what it was,

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:43.222
and all that sort of stuff,

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:45.187
and that to me
is the best way to say

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:46.313
that's Chris Farley.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:47.481
- Richard...

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.775
Is this your coat?

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.026
- Fat guy in a little coat

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:52.944
was something
that Farley did to Spade.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:55.072
- Don't do it.
- Fat guy in a little coat.

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:56.637
- In my office,
he'd put the coat on.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.658
"David,
I've got your jacket on."

01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:00.535
"Fat..."
- Fat guy in a little coat.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.703
- Don't.

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:04.623
- David, for real, would say,
"Chris, take it off."

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:06.124
"Take the jacket off."

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.542
"You're going to break my ja...
You're going to split it."

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.169
"Take it off.
Take it off."

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:10.962
"Oh, fat guy in a little coat."

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:13.256
- [music] Fat guy
in a little coat... [music]

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:16.801
- Take it off, dickhead.
I'm serious.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.261
- Richard, what's happening?

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.386
[ripping]

01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:23.308
- He and Spade were
just induplicable as a team,

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:24.559
wonderful together.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:26.103
David is very acerbic,

01:08:26.228 --> 01:08:28.729
and he's, you know,
he's a toughie,

01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:30.732
and Chris is a softie.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.318
You've got the best
of Belushi and Aykroyd,

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.112
of Abbott and Costello,

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.404
of Martin and Lewis.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:41.701
You had just a perfect yin-yang
situation with those guys.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.370
- A fantastic combination

01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:46.163
of ultimately innocent
and ultimately jaded.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:51.169
They are the oil and vinegar
of comedy.

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:57.175
- Ugh, I can actually hear you
getting fatter.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.178
- They would react to stress
in different ways.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:03.682
Chris would get bigger,
and there'd be less of David,

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:04.890
and I used to say

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:07.060
that the amount of weight
in the frame

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:10.104
kind of stayed constant,
you know, in a two-shot.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.023
- They were funny.
They were close.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:14.192
You could tell they
were really good friends,

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.778
and only really,
really good friends

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.988
can fight the way they fought.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.073
- You don't want none of me.
Think it through.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.783
- Come on, give me
your best shot.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:23.118
I'll give you a free one.
Let me have it.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:24.243
[grunts]

01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:27.205
That was a good one.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.330
- They'd throw something

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.916
and not speak to each other
for a couple hours,

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.042
and we'd all sit there and laugh

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.211
and watch this thing
go back and forth.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.379
- That's it!

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.590
You are going to die!

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.801
I am going to get you!

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.679
- And when I would visit
those fools during the shoot,

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:45.098
they'd have little fights
on occasion,

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:47.225
and Farley would have a snap,

01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:50.312
and Spade would be scared
for his life.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:52.063
They were in love
with each other.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:53.356
We all were in love,

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:54.858
but Spade and Farley

01:09:54.983 --> 01:09:57.903
had a definite
brotherly relationship.

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:01.948
- Tommy Boy is basically
a skeleton sketch

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:04.159
of how we grew up in Wisconsin,

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.703
minus Bo Derek, of course.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:09.039
- I met Chris
literally on the set,

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:10.290
and I looked down,

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:11.958
and Chris was doing pushups,

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.126
<i>and just...</i>

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.978
And he got up,
and his face was beet red,

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:18.089
and he was so cute, so adorable.

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:19.466
- Holy schnykies.

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:23.762
- First scene, of course,
was the swimming pool scene.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:24.930
- Oh, man.

01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:27.015
Dad, she's like a 10.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.017
- Hi, honey.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:30.810
- And Chris was funny all day,

01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:32.938
and he actually made me relax

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.898
by making fun of me, kind of,

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:36.107
which was good.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:37.442
- I'm Tommy.

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:40.237
- I'm Beverly,
and you are just adorable.

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:41.196
{giggles}

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:42.801
- Brian Dennehy's character
and Chris,

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.033
that was a lot of him
and my dad.

01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:47.202
It's kind of like
who my dad was, you know,

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:51.164
this big, gruff,
great salesman guy, you know.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:53.750
- Hi, Dad.

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:55.042
- Tommy!

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.378
[both laugh]

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:58.672
- Ooh...

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:03.969
- We had that in common.

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:06.263
We both loved our dads,
and we both were...

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:07.948
anything our fathers said,
we'd be like,

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:10.850
"Well, now I have to do it,
because my dad told me to."

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:14.069
- Scram, don't give her
the weight room thing.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.981
- Do you know
where the weight room is?

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.357
I'll check it out.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:18.817
- Sorry.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:22.529
- I was hanging out with David
and Chris and Fred Wolf,

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:24.197
so he wrote a part for me,

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.199
but I wasn't supposed
to be naked in that part.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:28.245
I was supposed to just
jump in the swimming pool,

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:29.326
and then they're like,

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.453
"Okay, and then you
take your bathing suit..."

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:31.621
and I was like "What?"

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:34.082
and they're like, "We rented out
this whole thing,"

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:35.250
and da da da da da.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.168
"You're not going
to not do it now, are you?"

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:39.254
It was such a pressure thing.

01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:40.922
Chris was so worried about,

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.549
"You've got to make her
comfortable,"

01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:46.136
and he would just always try
to make me laugh, like,

01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:49.097
or always put a towel
around me, like...

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:52.726
he was just being
such a protective gentleman.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:54.352
- I'm back.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:58.773
Richard?

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:00.859
What were you doing?

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.902
- Going over some documents.

01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:04.195
- Look at his movie performances.

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.739
The physicality, I mean...

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.699
and Tommy Boy, just the...

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:10.035
you saw
his quality as an actor there,

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.661
and his range as an actor.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.330
- I'm going to really miss him.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.833
- Your father was a great guy.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.001
- Yeah.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:19.085
- What I think
was really important

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.253
with Tommy Boy

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:21.838
is it showed Chris
how we saw him

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.048
behind closed doors.

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:24.424
Sensitive. Kind.

01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:27.260
That kindness,
and that real vulnerability.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.971
- Oh, Richard, I'm so happy.
Hold me.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:31.222
- Yikes.

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.516
- Don't run away
from your feelings.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:34.976
- It's so great
when everyone leaves you alone.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.144
We're just trying <i>to...</i>

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.228
"What's the funniest thing
we can do here"

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.855
"that makes us laugh?"

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:41.149
Sandler, during Tommy Boy,

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.610
wrote him a sketch
in Pepper Boy.

01:12:44.778 --> 01:12:45.820
- Say when.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.364
- When.

01:12:47.489 --> 01:12:48.489
- Grazie.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:49.991
- Adam Sandler
is Pepper Boy, right?

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.368
It's like, you know,
"Fresh pepper?"

01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:52.952
and he would give people pepper.

01:12:53.078 --> 01:12:54.496
He's under high scrutiny
for this.

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:56.581
- It is an art
of the Pepper Boy, Carlo.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.333
Don't let it die with me.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.335
Please, let me teach it to you.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.128
- Teach me, Senor Marco.

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:05.030
- We had to fly all the way back
from Toronto to do the show,

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.424
and I wasn't even in it.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.301
- All right.
You see that man right there?

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:09.302
- Farley was in it,

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:10.762
but he only had one line
in that sketch,

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.263
so he was mad about it,

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.599
so he put on this huge beard.
He looked ridiculous.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.226
He goes, "Watch this line.
I'll get a laugh,"

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.311
and I'm like,
"I don't think so."

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:19.771
"You're not supposed to.
It's supposed to be Sandler,"

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:20.939
but...

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:22.357
- Fresh-y pepper?

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:24.067
- He goes, "Oh yeah? Huh?"

01:13:24.192 --> 01:13:25.192
Bite his lip,

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.111
and you knew
you were in trouble.

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:28.238
- Why, thank you, Pepper Boy!

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.950
That's the perfect
amount of pepper.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:34.035
Bravo!

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.579
- "Why, thank you, Pepper BOY,"

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.040
and we're like...

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.709
- Of course,
if you only have one line,

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:45.088
why did you fucking put on
a beard for one Li...

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.882
Like, it's, like,
this is the funniest shit ever,

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:50.093
and he's, like, just the guy...

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:52.053
He's a warm body in the sketch.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.596
It's an Adam Sandler sketch.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:54.764
- Bravo!

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.183
- That was his, like,
fighting back

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:59.018
at, "Watch how funny I can be,"

01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:00.728
and it works.
He's great at it.

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.689
-30 seconds before a skit,

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:04.649
would tap you on the shoulder
and go,

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:05.817
"I'm going to get you."

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.194
He did that a few times to me,
and he always got me.

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:10.321
- You did it!
How do you feel?

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.365
- Like I can fly, senor,

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:15.076
on wings made of pepper.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.955
- He was aware of his power.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:20.456
He was aware of his gift.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.791
He's got his BA
from Second City.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:24.169
He's got his Master's
from Saturday Night Live.

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.420
Totally equipped-

01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:26.379
- Saturday Night Live

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:28.006
with a feature film
where he's the lead...

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.382
I can't imagine the pressure

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.176
of just flying alone
back and forth

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:32.677
to be doing a movie,
then flying for the show,

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:33.845
then fly back

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.347
to be up at 5:00 a.m.
Monday morning

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:36.556
to shoot the mov...

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:38.224
I mean,
it's incredible pressure.

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.392
- That's going
to wear everybody down,

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.561
but it didn't wear Chris down
at all,

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:42.520
not even a little bit.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.063
<i>He didn't seem...</i>
he <i>didn't...</i>

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:45.523
I would...
"How are you doing?"

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:46.608
"Yeah, it's great.
So what are we doing now?"

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:48.693
He just didn't show
any signs of wear at all.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.904
- He will be
a major motion picture star

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.530
when his brand-new film,
Tommy Boy,

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.656
opens nationwide.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:54.616
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.367
please welcome
the human thunderball,

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:57.535
Chris Farley.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.662

[audience cheers louder]

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:25.855
A very impressive entrance.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.482
I think in the 10 years
we've been doing this show,

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:30.443
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:31.929
- I want to do
what the king wants,

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.530
so I'd like to do that.

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:38.409
I'm on the Dave Letterman show!
By golly...

01:15:38.535 --> 01:15:39.452
- How are you doing, buddy?

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:41.287
All excited
about your big movie?

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:42.693
- Aw, man.
- You and David Spade.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.707
David Spade, a very funny man,
very nice guy,

01:15:44.832 --> 01:15:46.334
and you guys are friends

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.794
as well as working together
on the show,

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:49.420
and now on this big movie.

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:51.506
- Yeah, he's my buddy.
We had a lot of fun.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:54.717
- When the movie came out,
the reviews were bad.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:58.846
For him, the idea that it could
be that willfully hurtful

01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:00.431
took him back,

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:02.767
and he didn't have
the confidence yet,

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.686
because it was his first movie,
you know,

01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:07.355
because I'd say,
"Let them wash over you,"

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.107
"and in two weeks,
nobody will care."

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.525
"All that matters is the work,"

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.820
"and it's a piece of work
that will be around."

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:17.031
- When the video came out,
it was an obsession.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:21.786
Our generation was into him,
and that was the coolest.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:26.040
- It's interesting that a movie
that was that savaged

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:29.919
ended up being sort of a movie
that's never gone away.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.841
- Time magazine published a page
of the 10 Comedies of All Time,

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:37.677
and Tommy Boy's there,

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.681
and I know that Farley
would have been incredibly proud

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:42.890
to see it there.

01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:44.434
- I really love this movie.

01:16:44.559 --> 01:16:45.560
I hope
that everyone will like it,

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.145
because we had fun making it,
and I think it's really good.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:48.354
- I hope so, too.

01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:49.897
I hope it's a huge hit for you
and for David Spade

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.357
and everybody else as well.

01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:52.483
- Because if I don't,

01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:53.985
I'm going back
to Wisconsin on the farm,

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.153
so go to it!

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:56.988
No, no, that was stupid too.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.156
I shouldn't have...

01:16:58.281 --> 01:16:59.281
- [laughs]

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.617
- Chris was at a place,

01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:02.702
not that he didn't need
SNL at that point,

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:03.827
because it feels

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:05.622
like it just had kind of
run its course.

01:17:05.747 --> 01:17:06.748
- Once you're on the show

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:09.626
and then you're in a movie
that does really, really well,

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.753
it's weird being on the show.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.958
It's not like you think
you're better than the show...

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.216
never, of course.

01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:19.677
The movies are a lot of work.

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:22.430
The love you get
for what you've done

01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:23.931
lasts for years,

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.466
and on Saturday Night Live,
it's gone by Sunday morning.

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:27.518
- For Chris,

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.813
the pull of Hollywood
was now very strong.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.983
A new administration
came in at NBC.

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:36.444
I think they did not like him.

01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:38.905
They did not like Adam Sandler.

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:43.076
It was a generational change.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:47.205
- What happens
after SNL is scary, man,

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.082
and you don't want it to end.

01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:50.708
I remember the last party,

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.502
looking at each other
and being like,

01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:55.880
"This is it, man?
This is over, that great run?

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.382
Now what?"

01:17:57.799 --> 01:17:58.758
- From my own experience
being on the show,

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:00.635
you always wanted,
like, to be on the show

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.179
and then have a movie out
that was a hit

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.305
at the same time,

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.140
and so if they don't do well,

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.725
you think, "Well, at least
I still have the show,"

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.560
"so I'm not, like,
completely out of it."

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:12.605
- And he was getting big offers
to do stuff,

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.774
big money,
they had big directors,

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.192
everybody loved him.

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.735
So he had stuff to do,

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:21.614
but there's that fear of,
like, "What the hell am I doing?"

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.574
"Why am I going
to be out on my own?"

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.617
because there,
you're a team together,

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:27.161
then all of a sudden,
it's all you.

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:29.622
- He said, "Kitten..."

01:18:30.123 --> 01:18:32.291
"I only saw myself
doing Saturday Night Live."

01:18:32.417 --> 01:18:35.169
"Like, that was my goal,
was to do Saturday Night Live"

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.046
"and make my father laugh."

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.882
"I never imagined myself
doing movies."

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.509
And I said, "Oh, no..."

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:44.345
"It's not in his comfort zone,"

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.305
and when
you don't get in your...

01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:47.765
you're past your comfort zone,

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.767
you've got to make sure
you're really grounded.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:52.729
Otherwise,
it can just be overwhelming.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.483
- He was a giant TV star,
a giant movie star,

01:18:57.608 --> 01:18:59.193
but the kind of routine

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:00.932
of having the show
and the family

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.656
and the same people and Lorne
and all his "brothers,"

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.200
and without that,
it wasn't the same.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:07.368
I mean,

01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:09.909
it might have made him feel
like he was floundering,

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:12.165
like there wasn't the safety
of the show,

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:15.877
the security of that set...
family atmosphere.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.176
- Hi, ma'am.

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:25.970
Vote for Donnelly.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.097
- Tommy Boy's a movie
that stayed with people,

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:29.974
and then what happens
is the studio is sort of like,

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.851
"We're going to try
to replicate that."

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:33.686
"We're going to try
to grab whatever Tommy Boy had"

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:35.646
"and make it that again,"
you know,

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:36.773
and I get that.

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:39.650
- Paramount had an option on him
from Tommy Boy,

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:40.818
and so he had to do Black Sheep.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.529
- Fred Wolf was 60 pages
into the script

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:44.739
when we were green-lit,

01:19:44.864 --> 01:19:45.865
and I went,

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.470
"We don't actually
have a script yet."

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:48.694
- Listen, I think it's better

01:19:48.743 --> 01:19:50.161
if we bring the energy
down a tad.

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:51.496
- Are you kidding me?

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.621
It's showmanship.

01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:53.539
You've got to go out
and get 'em.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:54.664
- It was like Tommy Boy.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:55.541
We wanted to get back
and do that.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:56.501
He goes,
"That's the one people like,

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:57.752
and we should try it again."

01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.754
Fred gave him
a rolling down a hill.

01:19:59.879 --> 01:20:01.506
He'd just keep falling,
because it gets funnier

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:02.882
because it's so stupid.

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.801
He's just very good at anything
you give him like that.

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:08.721
He can come up with, like,
jerky moves and funny faces,

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:10.765
and he snaps his head around.

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:12.642
- Bunk beds.

01:20:13.643 --> 01:20:15.061
I've got dibs on top.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:16.312
- Okay.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.519
- In the cabin with David,

01:20:17.522 --> 01:20:19.774
or him
rolling down that hill, <i>or...</i>

01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:22.318
There was
lots of really funny things.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:23.736
- Nothing's going
to stop us now.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:24.695
[engine fails to start]

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:25.738
- We knew there was a difference

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:26.906
between Black Sheep
and Tommy Boy,

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.574
and Chris knew that, too.

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:29.742
The process became interrupted.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:33.621
It just got to be manipulated
by people from outside.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.123
- Okay,
maybe we could use some help.

01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:37.083
- The two pictures grossed

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:39.126
almost exactly
the same amount of money,

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:42.755
so the fact that one vehicle
maybe was a little rushed

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.467
and maybe not made as lovingly
as the first one was,

01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:49.136
that's what you take away
when you're doing it.

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:50.382
- Chris was a perfectionist,

01:20:50.388 --> 01:20:54.225
and he was always, you know,
he just wanted to do the best,

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.591
and if it wasn't the best,
he was really hard on himself.

01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:58.479
- Just because
things aren't perfect

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.898
doesn't mean
people won't like them.

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:04.026
- Unfortunately,
I was with him when it...

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:06.362
when it...

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.364
when he relapsed the first time.

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:09.532
And we were...

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:12.660
He called me up, and he said,
"Do you want to go see...

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:15.872
We're doing a preview show
of Black Sheep."

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:18.958
He was just getting nervous,
and he was upset,

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.711
and to see it onscreen,
he was like...

01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:23.963
it just was enough
to set him off.

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:25.528
And the next day,
my Dad calls me up.

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:27.675
He was like,
"What happened last night?"

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.000
It's like, "What do you mean?"

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.932
It's like, "Christopher
trashed his hotel room,"

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:34.724
"and, you know, he's back
in the, you know, rehab, and..."

01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:35.850
It's like, holy shit.

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:38.603
- So he went off the handle
for two weeks,

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:40.730
then they dragged him
back into rehab.

01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:41.939
A couple more rehabs,

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:44.901
and then sober
for Beverly Hills Ninja.

01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:46.903
- Here's the thing.

01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:48.349
If you're a drug addict,
you know,

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:49.697
and an alcoholic,

01:21:49.864 --> 01:21:51.282
all of a sudden you're sober,
you're sober today.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.575
Like, it's a day.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.784
"I'm sober.
Oh, look at me, I'm sober."

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:56.787
But if you're fat,
and I speak from experience...

01:21:56.913 --> 01:21:57.914
you look in the mirror,

01:21:58.039 --> 01:21:59.332
and you've eaten healthy
one day,

01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:00.708
you're still fat.

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:02.877
You're like,
"How do I beat this thing?"

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:03.961
- I have always looked up to you,

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.922
and you have always
looked out for me,

01:22:06.047 --> 01:22:07.847
but now it is time
that I look out for myself.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.717
- Be careful in your travels,
Haru.

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.594
The world is a dangerous place.

01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:12.929
[grunts]

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:15.573
- When I saw him,
and he was cleaned up,

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:16.849
and he'd been to rehab
a couple times,

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:19.810
and he was refusing booze
at this party,

01:22:20.061 --> 01:22:22.229
he was standing up for himself,

01:22:23.022 --> 01:22:25.062
and he wasn't a kid going,
"What? What do you want?"

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:27.902
"Oh, yeah, cool, great,
whatever you've got I'll do"

01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:30.780
"to make you happy,
to be a part of this."

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:34.200
He was saying,
"No, I need to protect myself."

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:37.912
- I think it's important
to just have a self-esteem

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:40.623
and believe in yourself

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.376
and be able to tell the world...

01:22:46.045 --> 01:22:48.965
I guess, "Go fuck yourself,"
on some level.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.970
It's a tough thing to deal with
that kind of fame

01:22:54.095 --> 01:22:54.929
when you're that fam...

01:22:55.054 --> 01:22:58.057
And if it happens fast,
it's almost lethal

01:22:59.058 --> 01:23:00.810
if you don't really have
a firm belief

01:23:00.935 --> 01:23:02.478
in what you are
and what you're doing.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:03.938
- It's sad to me, though,

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:05.982
that he didn't love himself

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.275
as much as everybody around him
loved him.

01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:12.571
- He went through 17 rehabs,
but he was a committed athlete.

01:23:13.072 --> 01:23:16.409
He was not going
to let this addiction beat him.

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:17.952
- I would love

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:20.204
when he'd come back
from any rehab

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.998
and be fresh and be like,

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:24.375
"I'm done with that,"

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:27.211
and he had his eating
under control,

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:28.921
and he was excited.

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.716
He was excited
to have that new shot.

01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:35.553
- Chris sober was the most
brilliant, brightest thing

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.013
I'd ever seen in my life.

01:23:37.138 --> 01:23:38.097
To this day,
nothing's come close.

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:40.683
- You can't walk around
being funny all the time.

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:42.129
You have to be yourself
sometimes,

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:44.020
and you have to be alone
sometimes.

01:23:44.145 --> 01:23:46.022
You can't be on stage
all the time.

01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:48.816
- I think when Fatty falls down,
everybody goes home happy.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.860
It's easier than dialogue.

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:52.778
I don't have much brain.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:56.032
- But Chris also had
such a terrible self-image.

01:23:56.157 --> 01:23:57.491
"Fatty fall down,"

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.869
and "I'm just an idiot."

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:02.078
And everyone around him
would go, "No, you're not."

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.832
"You're really smart,
and you're a great person,"

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.375
and he'd go, "No, I'm not."

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.334
- There's you, there's...

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:08.502
[Crash]

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:10.254
Whoops-a-daisy.

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.548
By god, whoops-a-daisy.

01:24:13.049 --> 01:24:17.011
- It's interesting when people
put out an image of themself

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:20.139
and then in some way
have to live that life.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:24.143
People want that, expect that,

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:26.687
and if you don't get
to go offstage

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:29.440
and somehow restore yourself,

01:24:30.024 --> 01:24:31.358
the pull of it <i>is...</i>

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:34.528
you know, the flame,

01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:37.240
and you can get burned
to a crisp.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:38.885
- And now,
here with another commentary

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:40.431
is Update commentator
Bennett Brauer.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:41.534
Bennett?

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.245
[applause]

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:48.417
- He had a big appetite...

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.919
a big appetite for life,

01:24:50.044 --> 01:24:51.462
for food, for drink,

01:24:51.879 --> 01:24:53.047
for late nights,

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:56.092
for the pleasures of the earth.

01:24:56.217 --> 01:24:58.469
- Well, maybe I'm not "the norm."

01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:01.764
I'm not "camera-friendly."

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:04.809
I don't "wear clothes
that fit me."

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:07.019
- You know, he sincerely wanted
to be sober,

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:09.563
and was sober
for periods of time,

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:10.773
and...

01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.775
but I always said,
"You can't be fat, super-fat,"

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.151
"and a drug addict."

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.319
"You've got to pick one."

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.781
- I'm not "hygienic."
I don't "wipe properly."

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.324
I lack "style."

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:23.828
I have no "charisma"
or "self-esteem."

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.456
- Something was, was... amiss.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:30.126
Something wasn't working.

01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:31.752
- You know, everyone's going
to do what they're going to do.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:32.878
That's the problem.

01:25:33.003 --> 01:25:34.672
There's only so much you can do.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:35.756
- I mean,
I'll be honest with you.

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:36.799
There was something going on
in college.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:38.551
That shit
doesn't just creep up on you.

01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:40.177
I mean, I guess
it does creep up on you, but...

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.012
- Alcohol probably being
his first love,

01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:43.973
but he wasn't, you know...

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.267
the other stuff
wasn't far behind.

01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:50.646
- You know,
an addictive person...

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.400
I mean, it's a conundrum.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.819
- I don't "own a toothbrush"

01:25:57.361 --> 01:25:58.946
or "let my scabs heal."

01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:03.367
I can't "reach
all the parts of my body."

01:26:04.285 --> 01:26:05.285
[audience laughs]

01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:07.788
- There was something
about him that...

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:09.290
He was just...
I don't know.

01:26:09.415 --> 01:26:11.750
He was in deep,
a hard place to be.

01:26:12.168 --> 01:26:14.003
All of us knew, every time.

01:26:14.295 --> 01:26:16.338
His hair looked different.
He looked sweaty.

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:18.549
He looked...
His eyes were different.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:19.925
They were just...

01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:22.094
You were like, "Oh, shit."

01:26:23.304 --> 01:26:25.055
It was rough seeing him
like that,

01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:26.223
and I hated it.

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:28.017
- Thank you, Kevin.

01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:29.351
- Bennett Brauer,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:31.145
- Thank you.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.733
- I knew he was in trouble.

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:37.193
People would call me,

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:39.862
and I thought
the thing he loved the most

01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:41.155
was doing the show.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.949
He never found the thing
that was as powerful.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:45.117
[laughter]

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:47.036
- Timmy, come back.
Come back. Come back.

01:26:47.161 --> 01:26:49.288
I mean,
I'm not the host tonight,

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:51.790
and Timmy damn sure
ain't the host tonight.

01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:52.958
[laughing]

01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:55.127
No, the host tonight

01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:57.588
is our good friend,
Chris Farley.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:26:58.713
Come on, Chris.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:26:59.840
[applause]

01:27:00.007 --> 01:27:01.050
- Here we go!

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:03.010
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:04.261
- Whatever shape he was in,

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.513
coming back
and making him go through it

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:08.265
to realize, if nothing else,

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.100
this is what's happened to you,
you know...

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:12.061
that thing you're losing,

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:15.272
that ability to be able
to still play the game,

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.857
which you were an all-star at.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:18.275
- You know what I've learned?

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.611
I've learned lessons
about responsibee...

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:21.987
Responsibility.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.115
Being responsible,
not only to myself,

01:27:25.241 --> 01:27:26.617
but to the people around me.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.160
That means you guys.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.454
I think it's time
to quit goofing around.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:32.539
I think it's time
to grow up, fellas.

01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:33.999
I want you...
everything's going to be okay.

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:35.334
- All right, man.
- Okay.

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:37.378
- I'm a new Chris, okay, fellas?

01:27:37.503 --> 01:27:40.297
Now, stay,
we've got a great show tonight.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.758
Mighty Mighty Bosstones
are here,

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.051
so stick around.

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:48.264
- It's just rare
that a person has that much joy

01:27:48.389 --> 01:27:51.767
and brings that much happiness
to everyone around them,

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:53.143
but with Chris...

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:57.398
there's a limit
to how wonderful it is to me.

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:00.650
And that limit

01:28:00.651 --> 01:28:04.154
is when you kill yourself
with drugs and alcohol.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:05.614
You know?

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:09.285
That's where it stops
being so fucking magical.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:13.372
- Things are getting better
and better for you, aren't they?

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:14.540
- Yeah.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:15.958
<i>I...</i> I <i>love it.</i>

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.169
- Success in show business

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:22.798
does not always create
the best version of people.

01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:25.134
- Do you get a sense now
of how your life might change

01:28:25.259 --> 01:28:26.760
with the fame
that is going to come

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.086
with the release of this film?

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:29.513
Not that you're not famous now,

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:31.515
but, you know,
it's going to be more and more.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.640
- And also thinking

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.643
that you have the physical
capacity to handle it,

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.603
because, you know, you may think
that you can handle it.

01:28:36.729 --> 01:28:38.230
- It's not going to change me.
Going to be the same old Chris.

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:39.690
- Yeah.
- Nothing's going to happen...

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:40.815
-om

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.026
- Are you going to be okay?

01:28:42.151 --> 01:28:43.819
- Yeah, I thought that...

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:58.334
- Maybe this was the life
that he was supposed to live.

01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:00.711
I mean, I'm selfish.
I wanted more.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:03.422
- You don't really believe it
when you're going through it.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:04.798
You just think...

01:29:05.424 --> 01:29:07.384
that he'd be able
to pull it out.

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:09.270
- "You're going to die
from that shit, buddy."

01:29:09.303 --> 01:29:11.013
"You've got to stop,
you've got to stop,"

01:29:11.138 --> 01:29:13.098
"and it's just not going
to end right,"

01:29:13.223 --> 01:29:14.475
and then... it...

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.394
[static]

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:19.605
- The entertainment world
has lost a huge talent,

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:20.981
and much too soon.

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:24.360
Comedian Chris Farley
died today in Chicago.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.577
- I wasn't shocked.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:37.206
And I was very sad,
and straight <i>up...</i>

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:39.833
[sighs]

01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:43.128
Lots of things you wish
didn't happen, you know?

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:45.005
- You know, he died alone,

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.467
you know, on a linoleum floor.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:50.761
It was
not what we wanted for him,

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:53.055
nor what he wanted for himself.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:55.057
- Nobody died...

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.059
You know, you're 33.

01:29:57.476 --> 01:29:58.811
You don't die at 33.

01:29:58.936 --> 01:30:00.270
It doesn't happen.

01:30:00.521 --> 01:30:02.022
- It took months to go,

01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:04.900
"Okay, I can talk about this,
or I could just..."

01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:06.068
Too much.

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:09.279
It comes up in something
in my mind every day,

01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:11.323
and I think it will forever.

01:30:11.657 --> 01:30:13.742
- I liked having him in my life.
It was better.

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:16.495
It made my life better
being a friend of mine.

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:24.169
- Do I wish
I could clone that guy?

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:25.575
But with Chris,
you just don't...

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.089
When they say,
"God made the mold"

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.535
"and he threw it out the window,"

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:29.800
there was no mold.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:31.176
There was just...

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:33.387
It was just ether, stars,
comets,

01:30:33.512 --> 01:30:35.514
precious jewels and gems...

01:30:35.806 --> 01:30:37.683
and Chris.

01:30:40.394 --> 01:30:42.020
- Thank you, folks.
You guys have been great.

01:30:42.146 --> 01:30:43.480
Thank you for coming out.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:46.150
- Keep it going for Kevin Farley,
everybody.

01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:47.317
[cheering]

01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:49.403
- Chris, he would never want
to bring any sadness.

01:30:49.528 --> 01:30:51.488
What he would want
is just everybody to laugh

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:52.781
and don't be sad.

01:30:53.574 --> 01:30:55.325
Keep the laughter going.

01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:57.369
- It's called a clown's prayer.

01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:58.815
Before any audition
at Second City

01:30:58.829 --> 01:30:59.997
or for TV or film,

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:02.458
we'd always take out the prayer.

01:31:02.583 --> 01:31:03.625
We'd read it.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:07.337
I actually still have
the prayer in my wallet, um...

01:31:07.463 --> 01:31:09.089
I usually don't read prayers,
but I will.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.049
I mean, I do, but not for...

01:31:11.717 --> 01:31:12.759
All right.

01:31:13.552 --> 01:31:16.180
"Dear Lord, as I stumble
through this life,"

01:31:16.305 --> 01:31:18.515
"help me to create more laughter
than tears,"

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.476
"dispense more happiness
than gloom,"

01:31:20.601 --> 01:31:22.769
"spread more cheer
than despair."

01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:25.314
"Never let me become so blase
that I will fail to see"

01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:27.316
"the wonder
in the eyes of a child"

01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:29.776
"or a twinkle
in the eyes of the aged."

01:31:29.902 --> 01:31:32.404
"Never let me forget that my work
is to cheer people,"

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:35.199
"make them happy,
and make them laugh."

01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:37.451
"Never let me acquire success
to the point"

01:31:37.576 --> 01:31:39.786
"where I discontinue
calling on my Creator"

01:31:39.912 --> 01:31:41.247
"in the hour of need,"

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:42.581
"and acknowledging Him
and thanking Him"

01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:44.208
"in the hour of plenty."

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.419
"And in my final moment,
may I hear you whisper,"

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:50.380
" 'When you made my people smile,
you made me smile.' "

01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:51.590
- Chris Farley.

01:31:51.757 --> 01:31:52.799
- Whoo!

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:54.801
-[music] You came into the world [music]

01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:58.055
[music] The day
that all the kings died [music]

01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:01.642
[music] I felt the heat
in your heart [music]

01:32:03.227 --> 01:32:05.312
[music] Saw the flames
in your eyes [music]

01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:09.191
[music] For three days
and three nights [music]

01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:12.903
[music] You didn't sleep
or even tire [music]

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:16.865
[music] Yeah,
you're gonna burn bright [music]

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:20.285
[music] 'Cause you were born
on fire [music]

01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:23.497
[music] Don't let nobody [music]

01:32:25.374 --> 01:32:27.209
[music] Try to dampen your flame [music]

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:30.462
[music] Try to cool you down [music]

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.382
[music] Try to make you change [music]

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:38.094
[music] Try to steal your heat [music]

01:32:40.097 --> 01:32:41.598
[music] Or mock your desire [music]

01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:46.019
[music] Take your flames
to the street [music]

01:32:47.521 --> 01:32:49.690
[music] 'Cause you were born
on fire [music]

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:55.279
[music] Saw you playing
in the ozone [music]

01:32:56.697 --> 01:32:58.699
[music] Jumping on your
time bombs [music]

01:33:00.742 --> 01:33:03.245
[music] Skipping through
the land mines [music]

01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:05.080
[music] Made to cut you down [music]

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:08.703
[music] Cut you down [music]

01:33:11.128 --> 01:33:15.132
[music] Laid to cut you down [music]

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:19.344
[music] Well, I seen you bleed [music]

01:33:21.305 --> 01:33:22.889
[music] And I seen you bruise [music]

01:33:24.975 --> 01:33:26.393
[music] And I seen you rage [music]

01:33:28.812 --> 01:33:30.480
[music] And I've seen you blue [music]

01:33:32.649 --> 01:33:34.901
[music] But that don't
break my heart [music]

01:33:36.403 --> 01:33:38.739
[music] Like when you
look me in the eye [music]

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:42.034
[music] And you ask me questions [music]

01:33:43.827 --> 01:33:46.246
[music] Like where we going
when we die? [music]

01:33:48.332 --> 01:33:50.167
[music] Then who you gonna love? [music]

01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:53.837
[music] And how you gonna live? [music]

01:33:55.422 --> 01:33:57.257
[music] And will you
be a poor one [music]

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:01.053
[music] Or could I leave you rich?
[music]

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:04.598
[music] I can't leave
you no money [music]

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:08.644
[music] I can't leave
you no land [music]

01:34:10.479 --> 01:34:12.397
[music] I can't leave
you no faith [music]

01:34:14.232 --> 01:34:15.901
[music] I lost the little I had [music]

01:34:17.736 --> 01:34:20.155
[music] Well, I can leave you
this truth [music]

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.659
[music] Hold on to hope
and desire [music]

01:34:25.494 --> 01:34:28.163
[music] And take your flames
to the streets [music]

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:31.041
[music] 'Cause you were
born on fire [music]

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.584
