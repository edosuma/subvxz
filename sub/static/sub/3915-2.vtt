00:01.799 --> 00:02.958
I thought I lost you.

00:02.959 --> 00:04.627
We're the people that just
saved your friend's life.

00:04.661 --> 00:05.927
How and why?

00:05.962 --> 00:07.396
We used an experimental
nanoplasma

00:07.430 --> 00:09.231
to trigger
the molecule regeneration,

00:09.266 --> 00:10.566
known as the serum.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.934
You agree to help us?
Help you do what?

00:12.969 --> 00:14.102
In a world where science
can create beasts,

00:14.137 --> 00:16.538
you shouldn't be
surprised to learn

00:16.573 --> 00:18.573
that there's a lot
worse things out there.

00:18.607 --> 00:20.441
You were attacked by I don't
know what. It was unlike

00:20.476 --> 00:21.943
anything I've ever seen before.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.945
Somehow, somebody's
getting ordinary people--

00:23.980 --> 00:25.613
innocents-- to do
extraordinary things.

00:25.648 --> 00:27.749
Things that nobody
should be able to do!

00:27.784 --> 00:29.951
(growling)

00:29.986 --> 00:31.386
(grunting)

00:31.420 --> 00:33.321
Vincent, wait.
Listen to me.

00:33.355 --> 00:34.822
You cannot kill him.
He is an innocent!

00:34.856 --> 00:36.324
If you do
this, you will

00:36.358 --> 00:38.593
cross a line that you can never
come back from,

00:38.627 --> 00:40.595
and, Vincent, we
will lose everything.

00:40.629 --> 00:43.063
(growling)

00:43.098 --> 00:45.032
(sighs)

00:46.635 --> 00:51.338
Will you marry me?

to take your breath away.

You really think

Otherwise, you are a fool

01:32.980 --> 01:34.948
I am no fool.

01:34.982 --> 01:36.782
Are you sure things aren't
moving too quickly for you?

01:36.817 --> 01:38.517
Nah.

01:38.552 --> 01:43.121
It's just-- getting engaged,
moving in together, it's a lot.

01:43.156 --> 01:45.524
Um...

01:45.559 --> 01:48.694
I thought you were keeping
this one in the houseboat?

01:48.729 --> 01:50.996
No, no. No, I think you're
thinking about the chrome one.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.665
It doesn't quite go
with the decor.

01:52.699 --> 01:55.334
Do you mind if we just
put it in storage for now?

01:55.369 --> 01:57.369
Yeah, sure.
- Good.

01:59.739 --> 02:01.840
Uh, you know
what, I just...

02:01.875 --> 02:04.142
I just got to text
JT and to make sure

02:04.177 --> 02:07.312
that he's coming along nicely
with his miracle cure.

02:07.347 --> 02:08.881
Still seems like a long shot--
he doesn't even know

02:08.914 --> 02:09.882
what saved him yet, does he?

02:09.916 --> 02:11.149
No, but, uh...

02:11.184 --> 02:13.151
if JT can't replicate

02:13.186 --> 02:15.520
the healing properties
in his blood, then, um,

02:15.554 --> 02:17.555
Agent Thomas may not survive.

02:17.590 --> 02:19.056
And if he doesn't,

02:19.091 --> 02:21.926
we lose our chance
to find out what he knew,

02:21.960 --> 02:24.520
which means more innocent people
are going to be experimented on.

02:26.265 --> 02:29.233
And more homicidal maniacs
out on the loose,

02:29.268 --> 02:31.102
so let's hope JT comes through,
huh?

02:31.136 --> 02:33.104
Maybe Tess and I should
sneak into Thomas' office,

02:33.138 --> 02:34.372
see what we can find.

02:34.406 --> 02:36.073
No, it's way too dicey.

02:36.108 --> 02:38.175
DHS didn't even know
what Thomas was working on.

02:38.210 --> 02:39.543
It might be our only shot.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.645
Uh, what is that?

02:44.049 --> 02:45.416
Uh, that is...

02:45.450 --> 02:48.184
That is my-my
flat screen.

02:48.219 --> 02:49.787
Oh, it's quite large.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.856
Uh, where were you
thinking of putting it?

02:52.891 --> 02:54.625
Right there above
the fireplace.

02:54.659 --> 02:56.940
And I was thinking maybe we
could move the couches around.

02:58.129 --> 02:59.963
Okay, if we move
the couches,

02:59.997 --> 03:02.132
then the French doors
would be blocked.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.034
Yeah, but it's really hard
to play video games

03:04.068 --> 03:05.936
when the sun's glaring off
the screen, though, Cat, so...

03:05.970 --> 03:07.137
Video games?

03:07.171 --> 03:08.805
How loud are-are
these video games?

03:08.839 --> 03:11.942
'Cause sometimes I like
to sit out here and do casework.

03:11.976 --> 03:13.743
Also I emptied a drawer for you

03:13.777 --> 03:15.577
to put all of your bills
and your paperwork in

03:15.579 --> 03:17.059
until we merge all
of that stuff, too.

03:23.754 --> 03:25.287
Uh, y-you know what?

03:25.322 --> 03:28.123
I-I'm just gonna go
and check on JT

03:28.158 --> 03:30.159
and see what's
taking him so long.

03:30.193 --> 03:32.394
Wait, don't forget your...

03:32.429 --> 03:34.330
keys.

03:34.364 --> 03:37.399
TESS: <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa--</i>
<i>what do you mean he just left?</i>

03:37.434 --> 03:39.134
Yeah, more like,
"blurred"-- it's bizarre.

03:39.169 --> 03:40.902
No, it's guys.

03:40.937 --> 03:44.106
They're preternaturally built to
bolt in the face of commitment.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.308
Been there, done that.
- That's what I'm worried about.

03:46.343 --> 03:47.943
What if Vincent's
having second thoughts?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.245
What? You just said...

03:50.280 --> 03:52.247
No, I know, but,
I mean, come on.

03:52.282 --> 03:54.415
You guys are like the frigging
fairy tale, it's different.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.250
What if the fairy tale's
becoming too real?

03:56.285 --> 03:58.453
I mean, one minute
we're unpacking boxes,

03:58.488 --> 03:59.855
then the next
he's running off

03:59.889 --> 04:02.524
to talk to JT about
synthetic serums.

04:02.558 --> 04:04.526
Whoa, whoa, isn't that
what you wanted, though?

04:04.560 --> 04:06.828
Him on board with the whole
mythological mystery?

04:06.863 --> 04:08.263
Finding your destiny,
all that crap?

04:08.297 --> 04:09.597
I don't know,
maybe Vincent feels

04:09.631 --> 04:12.166
like I forced him
into all of this.

04:12.201 --> 04:13.601
You mean moving in?

04:13.635 --> 04:15.003
No, I mean everything,

04:15.037 --> 04:18.272
including the
mythological mystery.

04:18.307 --> 04:20.708
Maybe he just needs
some time, a-a little space.

04:20.742 --> 04:21.942
A little space?

04:21.976 --> 04:23.777
Tess, he's moving
in with me.

04:23.812 --> 04:26.179
By definition that means
he is giving up space.

04:26.214 --> 04:27.314
Just don't freak out,

04:27.348 --> 04:29.650
and try not to control
the situation, either.

04:29.684 --> 04:31.184
I don't try to
control situations.

04:31.219 --> 04:33.320
Really? Then what are
we doing here,

04:33.354 --> 04:34.955
about to break
into Homeland Security?

04:34.990 --> 04:36.857
We are trying to figure
out what Agent Thomas knew

04:36.892 --> 04:38.732
about Th-those freaky
experiments, that's what.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.160
Trying to save lives.

04:40.194 --> 04:42.295
Okay, you know what,
with the new captain coming,

04:42.330 --> 04:43.863
I'm a little bit more concerned
with saving my own ass,

04:43.898 --> 04:45.465
and so should you.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.468
But, no, we're here because
when you want what you want...

04:48.503 --> 04:52.172
Okay, look-- all you have
to do is run interference.

04:52.206 --> 04:54.174
I will sneak into
Agent Thomas' office.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.875
How the hell are
you going to do that?

04:55.910 --> 04:57.544
Isn't his office
secured by...

04:57.578 --> 05:00.580
I lifted Thomas'
keycard from his room.

05:00.614 --> 05:04.851
Just distract his boss,
and I will handle the rest.

05:04.885 --> 05:07.787
Like I said, when you want
what you want...

05:13.761 --> 05:16.241
Whatever Thomas and Barnett were
working on, it was top secret.

05:29.543 --> 05:32.878
♪

05:43.255 --> 05:46.324
So they called 'em in for a
briefing on Tuesday, and...

05:52.465 --> 05:55.233
(knocks on door)
MAN: Anyone in there? Hello?

06:24.429 --> 06:25.795
Whoa...

06:25.830 --> 06:27.063
You're on a
spree, dude.

06:27.098 --> 06:28.265
Got issues?

06:28.299 --> 06:29.466
No.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.668
I mean, yes.

06:31.702 --> 06:33.803
You could do casework
with all this noise, right?

06:33.838 --> 06:35.339
Doing it right now.

06:35.373 --> 06:36.940
I'm thinking about
other ways to extract

06:36.974 --> 06:39.475
the miracle cure
from my blood,

06:39.510 --> 06:41.945
even though I've got
my first trial spinning

06:41.979 --> 06:44.247
in the hospital's
centrifuge as we speak.

06:44.281 --> 06:46.415
Just for that,
I am gonna...

06:46.450 --> 06:47.617
save you.

06:47.652 --> 06:48.652
Wow.

06:48.653 --> 06:49.819
Why can't
I do that?

06:49.854 --> 06:51.821
Same reason you don't
have to worry

06:51.856 --> 06:53.589
about beasting out
on your fiancé.

06:53.624 --> 06:55.625
I still can't work out
what the hell that's about.

06:55.659 --> 06:57.627
Panic attack, fear
of commitment--

06:57.661 --> 06:59.028
it's just guy stuff.

06:59.062 --> 07:00.763
I don't know,
guys do not beast out

07:00.797 --> 07:02.431
when they're moving in
with their girl.

07:02.466 --> 07:05.834
True, but that's how your primal
brain shows fight or flight.

07:05.869 --> 07:07.303
Damn it.

07:07.337 --> 07:08.504
I suck at this.

07:08.539 --> 07:09.639
Saved you again.

07:09.673 --> 07:10.973
Fight or flight, huh?

07:11.007 --> 07:13.308
News flash--

07:13.342 --> 07:16.211
the male of the species
ain't wired for commitment.

07:16.245 --> 07:18.180
We're built to propagate,
not cohabitate.

07:18.214 --> 07:20.282
Come on, man,
I can't tell Cat that.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.051
(laughs) Of course not--
this is guy talk.

07:22.085 --> 07:24.119
The whole living together
thing only popped up

07:24.154 --> 07:25.721
100,000 years ago.

07:25.755 --> 07:27.489
But the primal brain
still wants to roll solo.

07:27.523 --> 07:28.823
Yeah, that's
the problem.

07:28.857 --> 07:30.625
You see, I-I'm having
enough trouble

07:30.660 --> 07:32.627
controlling my primal brain
as it is,

07:32.662 --> 07:35.463
hunting now who knows what.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.666
Come to think of it,
though, you're right,

07:37.700 --> 07:40.502
it did help when I changed
the subject with her.

07:40.536 --> 07:41.736
Sure, you get your
adrenaline down,

07:41.770 --> 07:43.471
then your
civilized brain,

07:43.506 --> 07:45.306
the part that controls your
primal brain, takes over.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.974
I mean, it's
a slippery slope.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.642
Okay, say after
I move in with Cat,

07:48.677 --> 07:50.544
we get into
some big fight,

07:50.579 --> 07:52.413
and I beast out,
I can't control it.

07:52.447 --> 07:55.416
She is the only one who can stop
me from crossing that line,

07:55.450 --> 07:58.419
but if I'm beasting out now
because of her,

07:58.453 --> 08:00.554
who's gonna bring me back?

08:00.589 --> 08:02.022
Vincent, just talk
to her about it,

08:02.056 --> 08:03.657
diffuse its
power over you.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.593
Just like I'm diffusing
my fear by doing this.

08:05.627 --> 08:08.061
Are you scared
of computerized aliens?

08:08.096 --> 08:09.730
No, Tess' brothers.

08:09.764 --> 08:11.498
Macho cop
brothers, too.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.368
One of whom is having a birthday
party at-- wait for it--

08:14.402 --> 08:15.736
a shooting range.

08:15.770 --> 08:17.771
Talk about your
knuckle-dragging simians.

08:17.805 --> 08:19.773
No offense.
- Yeah.

08:19.807 --> 08:22.408
So, what, you're trying to get
better by playing a video game?

08:22.443 --> 08:26.412
I'm just trying not to embarrass
myself and, by extension, Tess.

08:26.447 --> 08:28.567
Come on, man, don't worry
about it-- just be yourself.

08:28.582 --> 08:32.352
Still trying to figure out
exactly who that is,

08:32.385 --> 08:34.053
especially after I got
that miracle cure.

08:34.087 --> 08:38.190
I just feel, I don't know,
different, not myself.

08:38.225 --> 08:40.559
Dude, you worry far too much.

08:40.594 --> 08:43.129
Pot, meet Kettle.
Kettle, Pot.

08:43.163 --> 08:45.565
Just go talk to
Cat, will you?

08:45.599 --> 08:47.567
I'm telling you,
it'll work out.

08:47.601 --> 08:49.369
Damn.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.536
Go home, sweep your
woman off her feet,

08:51.571 --> 08:54.539
be the man she loves,
not the beast you fear.

08:54.574 --> 08:56.475
You'll be fine,
trust me.

08:56.509 --> 08:57.509
Go.

08:58.779 --> 09:00.846
Okay, okay.

09:11.257 --> 09:12.257

09:12.258 --> 09:13.258

09:39.988 --> 09:41.555
It was a mistake.

09:41.590 --> 09:43.391
No, no, it's not you,
i-it's not.

09:43.425 --> 09:44.558
I-It's, um...

09:44.593 --> 09:46.761
It's Matthew.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.396
Matthew?

09:48.430 --> 09:49.830
Y-Your fiancé?

09:49.865 --> 09:52.266
My ex-fiancé.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.634
He just dumped me.

09:53.668 --> 09:55.068
W-W-Why?

09:55.103 --> 09:57.070
I don't know.

09:57.105 --> 09:58.638
He just mumbled
some lame excuse,

09:58.672 --> 10:00.807
but, uh, I guess
it all boils down to--

10:00.841 --> 10:02.475
he's afraid of commitment.

10:04.779 --> 10:06.613
I just gotta
move these boxes

10:06.647 --> 10:08.515
out of the way, okay?
I'm sorry, I don't...

10:08.549 --> 10:10.317
I don't mean to rain
on your parade.

10:10.351 --> 10:12.786
After all, I know
you just got engaged.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.021
(choked up):
Congratulations, by the way.

10:15.055 --> 10:16.255
Thanks.

10:17.725 --> 10:19.258
So, uh...

10:19.293 --> 10:20.993
So you're moving in, huh?

10:21.028 --> 10:22.695
Yeah, yeah,
you know what?

10:22.730 --> 10:24.764
I'm-I'm trying to, anyway.

10:24.799 --> 10:26.098
Well, what do you mean,
"trying to"?

10:26.133 --> 10:27.767
I, you know, I just, it's...

10:27.802 --> 10:29.936
uh, it's different, that's all.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.537
Yeah, well,
especially considering

10:31.571 --> 10:33.872
how long Cat's lived here
by herself.

10:33.907 --> 10:36.008
Good luck finding
any space for your stuff.

10:36.043 --> 10:38.277
(snarls quietly)

10:38.312 --> 10:39.812
Sorry?

10:39.846 --> 10:41.047
(coughs)

10:41.081 --> 10:43.149
Just a little cough I got.
Just...

10:43.183 --> 10:44.616
HEATHER:
Are you sweating?

10:44.651 --> 10:45.951
Me?

10:45.985 --> 10:46.819
No.

10:46.853 --> 10:48.153
Are you all right?

10:48.187 --> 10:50.188
Yeah.
- Wait a minute. This...

10:50.222 --> 10:53.291
this is all looking
vaguely familiar to me.

10:53.326 --> 10:54.860
Vincent, you're...

10:54.894 --> 10:56.728
you're not having
second thoughts, are you?

10:56.763 --> 10:58.163
No!

10:58.197 --> 11:00.065
No, God-- no, no, no.

11:00.099 --> 11:01.900
I mean... don't
be ridiculous.

11:01.935 --> 11:03.634
(phone ringing)
There isn't...

11:03.669 --> 11:04.836
Excuse me.

11:06.839 --> 11:09.740
Catherine.
Yeah, we were just talking about you.

11:09.775 --> 11:12.077
We? Who's "we"?
Vincent, don't tell her I'm here.

11:12.111 --> 11:15.813
I mean, I-I-I was...
was thinking about you.

11:15.848 --> 11:17.004
(quietly): Why not?

11:17.028 --> 11:18.516
No, I-I just don't
want her to know what happened.

11:18.517 --> 11:19.550
About the shower?

11:19.585 --> 11:21.051
No, about me and Matthew.

11:21.086 --> 11:22.219
Where are you?

11:22.253 --> 11:24.021
Me? I'm-I'm at
the apartment.

11:24.055 --> 11:25.089
CATHERINE:
Oh, that's great.

11:25.123 --> 11:26.757
Are you unpacking?

11:26.792 --> 11:27.859
No, actually, um, I was,

11:27.893 --> 11:30.528
I was hoping to surprise you.

11:30.562 --> 11:31.996
I like the sound of that.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.731
Well, I mean, don't tell her
about the shower, either.

11:33.765 --> 11:35.005
CATHERINE:
Look, I think I found

11:35.033 --> 11:37.267
a lead at Agent Thomas' office.

11:37.302 --> 11:38.702
(quietly):
Why not?

11:38.736 --> 11:39.736
"Why not?" What do you...
what do you mean?

11:39.770 --> 11:41.405
I mean, um...

11:41.439 --> 11:43.040
I mean, what...
what about the lead?

11:43.074 --> 11:44.441
CATHERINE:
Well, apparently,

11:44.476 --> 11:46.276
Thomas busted this
ex-special forces guy

11:46.311 --> 11:47.777
a couple weeks ago--

11:47.812 --> 11:50.680
a courier with Effective
World-Wide Solutions.

11:50.715 --> 11:51.882
VINCENT:
Okay.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.282
Why do I know that name?

11:53.317 --> 11:54.684
CATHERINE:
Probably Afghanistan.

11:54.719 --> 11:57.787
They traffic guns,
missiles, contraband.

11:57.822 --> 11:59.556
It could be that
he's somehow connected

11:59.590 --> 12:01.290
to whoever's
behind these experiments.

12:01.325 --> 12:03.693
Could you meet me down here,
in case I need beast backup?

12:03.728 --> 12:05.562
Yeah, of course, no problem.

12:05.596 --> 12:07.731
Oh! Oh, and can you also defrost
some hamburger meat?

12:07.765 --> 12:09.032
I was thinking of making us
tacos tonight

12:09.066 --> 12:10.266
to celebrate our first night

12:10.300 --> 12:12.301
officially living together.

12:12.336 --> 12:14.137
Yeah.

12:14.171 --> 12:15.438
Yeah, okay.

12:15.472 --> 12:16.772
Okay,
gotta go.

12:16.806 --> 12:18.307
I-I gotta go.

12:18.342 --> 12:20.309
Um, but I'm
sorry to hear

12:20.344 --> 12:23.746
about you and,
uh, Matth... Matthew.

12:29.285 --> 12:31.620
(horn honks)

12:31.655 --> 12:33.288
All right, so...
whatever you do,

12:33.322 --> 12:34.790
leave the shooting to me.

12:34.824 --> 12:36.258
You don't have to
impress these bozos.

12:36.292 --> 12:37.793
What about you?
I'm the little sister.

12:37.827 --> 12:39.895
I can't
impress them.

12:39.930 --> 12:41.063
No, I mean what if
I want to impress you?

12:41.097 --> 12:42.897
By blowing up
a paper target?

12:42.932 --> 12:45.067
Or showing I'm
back in the world,

12:45.101 --> 12:47.335
having fun,
being the old JT.

12:47.370 --> 12:49.304
Just be the old JT,
that's all I care about.

12:49.338 --> 12:51.673
Come here.

12:51.707 --> 12:52.874
Let's go.

12:54.177 --> 12:55.377
Fine.

12:56.946 --> 13:00.014
(phone ringing)

13:00.049 --> 13:01.315
JT:
Hey. How'd it go?

13:01.349 --> 13:02.516
VINCENT:
Not great.

13:02.551 --> 13:03.952
I almost lost it again.

13:03.986 --> 13:05.186
JT:
Wait, what?

13:05.220 --> 13:06.588
With Cat?

13:06.622 --> 13:08.022
No. No, this time with Heather,

13:08.057 --> 13:09.657
after she was getting
out of the shower.

13:09.692 --> 13:11.192
Wait, Heather was in the shower?

13:11.226 --> 13:12.259
What happened with Heather?

13:12.294 --> 13:13.374
VINCENT:
Look, the point is,

13:13.395 --> 13:14.761
I'm not getting
any better here, man,

13:14.796 --> 13:16.297
and now Catherine wants my help

13:16.331 --> 13:18.299
trying to track down
one of Thomas' leads.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.600
So?

13:19.634 --> 13:20.767
So, I'm on primal red alert,
here, man.

13:20.802 --> 13:22.603
Would you just calm down?

13:22.637 --> 13:24.357
Is he freaking out
about moving in with Cat?

13:24.372 --> 13:26.107
No, don't be silly.

13:26.141 --> 13:27.208
Just stay
focused,

13:27.242 --> 13:29.510
breathe, and, you know,

13:29.544 --> 13:31.544
don't beast out unless you
absolutely have to, okay?

13:31.579 --> 13:32.946
Okay.

13:32.981 --> 13:34.701
I gotta go, I got my own problems.
Let's go.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.553
Hey!
- Not bad, not bad.

13:40.588 --> 13:42.388
JT:
Are your brothers watching me?

13:42.423 --> 13:43.657
I feel like your brothers
are watching me.

13:43.691 --> 13:44.858
Ignore 'em,
they're dicks.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.593
Just relax.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.831
MAN:
Uh, hold it.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.366
Yeah, my bad.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.369
Uh, he actually has to use
my service revolver.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.637
JT:
Whoa.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.005
Why?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.240
Uh, team gun.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.975
Edward says those
are the rules, so...

14:03.010 --> 14:06.012
This is your
service revolver?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.546
You know what, JT?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.081
It's just like a tranq.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.283
Just point and shoot.
You got this.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.156
Okay...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.724
(exhales)

14:25.097 --> 14:27.732
(laughing)
- JT: Point and shoot?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.334
I was hanging on for dear life.
All right, all right, all right.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.835
Try aiming low.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.906
Use the kickback to help
hit something, anything.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.177
(sighs)

14:41.747 --> 14:43.114
You know what?

14:43.149 --> 14:45.016
Maybe he should try pin
the tail on the donkey?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.052
You're such a jerk.
You know that, right?

14:47.086 --> 14:49.287
What?
We're just having a little fun.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.089
Look, besides, Professor's
gonna have to get used to it,

14:51.123 --> 14:54.124
especially if I get
promoted to next captain.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.526
You're interviewing?
- Yeah.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.894
Why not?

14:56.928 --> 14:59.063
125th could use a good one
after everything

14:59.097 --> 15:00.364
it's been through.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.799
Know anybody that
could do better?

15:01.833 --> 15:03.201
Hell, even I could
do better.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.468
You?
- Yeah.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.537
Oh, my God, please, Tess.
Give me a break.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.038
Look, no offense,

15:08.073 --> 15:09.574
but sleeping with
your old boss

15:09.608 --> 15:11.709
doesn't make you
qualified to be one, so...

15:11.743 --> 15:13.443
(gunshots)

15:16.815 --> 15:19.083
BROTHER:
Not bad, buddy, not bad.

15:19.117 --> 15:21.085
You owe your sister
an apology, birthday boy.

15:25.824 --> 15:26.856
(car horns honking)

15:29.279 --> 15:30.827
VINCENT: You sure this is
the right address?

15:30.861 --> 15:32.095
CATHERINE:
Maybe it's a front,

15:32.129 --> 15:34.264
or intentionally
off the grid.

15:34.298 --> 15:36.566
Are you all right?
- Me? Yeah, why?

15:36.773 --> 15:39.007
You hardly said two words
on the ride over here.

15:39.041 --> 15:41.743
I'm just a little
anxious, you know,

15:41.778 --> 15:43.978
about what we may
find in here.

15:44.013 --> 15:45.780
I don't know, it's a bit
of a slippery slope lately,

15:45.814 --> 15:47.315
you know, with
beasting out.

15:47.349 --> 15:49.017
I don't want to do it
unless I absolutely have to.

15:49.051 --> 15:50.651
Don't worry, I'll save you.

15:52.121 --> 15:53.554
(Vincent sighs)

15:57.626 --> 15:59.593
Looks like someone
beat us to the punch.

15:59.628 --> 16:01.762
Can't be a
coincidence.

16:10.539 --> 16:12.105
Who else would be

16:12.140 --> 16:13.674
looking for
this courier?

16:13.708 --> 16:16.143
I don't know, but whoever it is,

16:16.177 --> 16:17.444
I think they're still here.

16:20.415 --> 16:22.749
We're definitely not alone.

16:27.255 --> 16:28.455
Vincent.

16:30.524 --> 16:34.026
It's Douglas, the courier
Agent Thomas busted

16:34.061 --> 16:36.261
trying to track down whoever's
behind these experiments.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.469
(hisses)

16:42.503 --> 16:43.803
His forehead's hot to touch,

16:43.838 --> 16:45.705
like he's been
electrocuted,

16:45.739 --> 16:48.374
but I can't see any
sign of entry wounds.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.708
How's that possible?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.344
I don't know.

16:51.378 --> 16:55.281
Maybe we ought to ask
whoever's watching us.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.187
Hey!
- Police! Stop!

17:15.957 --> 17:17.134
Freeze!

17:45.661 --> 17:47.257
He's gone.
No sign of him.

17:47.686 --> 17:50.120
Yeah, well, there's no sign how
he overloaded all this, either.

17:50.155 --> 17:52.056
Wasn't pre-rigged,
neither were the outlets.

17:52.090 --> 17:53.958
Which means?
- He's gotta be one of

17:53.992 --> 17:55.325
those experiments.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.561
How so?

17:56.595 --> 17:58.395
Well, the common
denominator

17:58.430 --> 18:00.130
has gotta be
electricity, right?

18:00.165 --> 18:04.301
I mean, the circuit breaker,
overhead lights, this guy.

18:04.335 --> 18:07.037
Ionic currents, they flow
into the brain's neurons

18:07.072 --> 18:08.672
causing voltage fluctuations;

18:08.706 --> 18:12.176
in, uh, plain terms, thinking.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.344
So, the courier's brain
was overloaded,

18:14.379 --> 18:16.213
just like everything else?
I don't know.

18:16.247 --> 18:18.815
I mean, that's the only way
I can think of explaining it.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.483
But if it's true,

18:20.517 --> 18:21.985
then that guy's gotta be
one of these "worse threats"

18:22.019 --> 18:23.486
that Thomas keeps warning us
about, right?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.590
Damn it, I should've
tried to stop him.

18:26.624 --> 18:28.091
I just, uh...

18:28.125 --> 18:29.926
I'm sorry, you know,
I'm a little...

18:29.961 --> 18:32.562
gun-shy at the moment.

18:32.597 --> 18:34.664
Do you want to talk about it?
Uh, no.

18:34.699 --> 18:35.998
Not right now.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.200
Anyway, it's my problem,
not yours.

18:37.234 --> 18:38.501
We're engaged.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.269
We're moving in together,
Vincent.

18:40.304 --> 18:42.605
Your problems are now
my problems, too.

18:42.639 --> 18:44.173
Okay.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.874
I know, but I think maybe
we should just focus

18:45.909 --> 18:47.543
on catching this guy before...

18:47.578 --> 18:49.545
before he hurts
anyone else.

18:49.580 --> 18:51.247
Can you track him, follow him?

18:51.281 --> 18:52.881
I can try.

19:00.423 --> 19:01.924
No, there's too much
electrostatic noise

19:01.958 --> 19:03.358
all around him.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.061
I... I can't.

19:06.096 --> 19:07.295
But maybe I
could track

19:07.330 --> 19:09.431
where he came from.
Come on.

19:15.004 --> 19:17.372
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:18.974 --> 19:22.310
I'm just trying to
survive, like you.

19:22.345 --> 19:24.312
I tracked down the courier

19:24.347 --> 19:26.247
who was supposed
to give me my medicine,

19:26.281 --> 19:28.582
but apparently you
intercepted it, Agent Thomas.

19:28.617 --> 19:30.551
Now, I need to
know where it is.

19:30.585 --> 19:32.453
I need to know
who you gave it to,

19:32.487 --> 19:33.888
or we'll both die.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.260
Who'd you give it to?

19:42.030 --> 19:43.364
(screams)

19:45.534 --> 19:47.934
Okay, three bull's-eyes
is no fluke, JT.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.103
What, can't a guy
defend his girl's honor?

19:50.138 --> 19:52.473
Yes, and I
loved it, too.

19:52.507 --> 19:54.107
Especially the
slack-jawed look

19:54.142 --> 19:56.143
on my stupid brothers' faces
afterwards.

19:56.178 --> 19:58.444
Still, you couldn't even
hit the target before,

19:58.479 --> 20:00.580
let alone three head shots.

20:00.614 --> 20:03.750
Yeah, I know.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.785
What?

20:04.819 --> 20:05.819
I don't know. I guess

20:05.853 --> 20:07.520
I can't help wondering--

20:07.555 --> 20:09.289
worrying-- whether or not

20:09.323 --> 20:10.623
the medicine Agent Thomas used

20:10.658 --> 20:12.592
to save me had a few...

20:12.626 --> 20:13.927
side effects.

20:13.961 --> 20:15.328
Well, I never heard
of side effects

20:15.362 --> 20:17.664
that turn people into sharp shooters.
- Yeah?

20:17.698 --> 20:19.965
Heard of side effects that turn
people into Spider-Man?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.767
Like that Wall Street guy
who climbed up buildings

20:21.802 --> 20:24.370
and nearly forced Vincent
into permanent primal mode?

20:24.405 --> 20:25.605
So, what are
you saying?

20:25.639 --> 20:27.039
That the medicine
they used on you

20:27.074 --> 20:29.175
made you one of
the experiments?

20:29.210 --> 20:31.043
Just 'cause you hit
a lousy target? Come on.

20:31.078 --> 20:32.544
Hey, you're the one
who said it wasn't a fluke.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.513
Thank you.

20:34.547 --> 20:36.115
You're just being paranoid.

20:36.149 --> 20:37.449
So, what else is new?

20:37.483 --> 20:38.784
You never give yourself

20:38.819 --> 20:40.820
any credit, JT--
you know that?

20:40.854 --> 20:43.189
You always sell
yourself short. Don't.

20:43.223 --> 20:45.290
You stood up for me.
That was you.

20:45.325 --> 20:46.892
Not some crazy-ass medicine.

20:46.927 --> 20:48.627
Well, I didn't like the way
they were treating you.

20:48.661 --> 20:50.229
You know what?

20:50.263 --> 20:51.830
You could be captain.

20:51.864 --> 20:53.298
Yeah, right.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.833
No, I'm serious, Tess.

20:54.867 --> 20:56.835
You're smart,
respected by all the other cops.

20:56.869 --> 20:58.169
Plus, you know that precinct

20:58.204 --> 20:59.404
better than anyone.

20:59.439 --> 21:00.905
You would be great.

21:00.940 --> 21:02.507
I don't think so.

21:02.542 --> 21:05.309
Now who's selling
themselves short?

21:05.344 --> 21:07.812
(cell phone ringing)

21:10.415 --> 21:11.916
Weird.

21:11.951 --> 21:13.184
It's Vincent's hospital.

21:13.219 --> 21:14.819
Why are they calling so late?

21:14.854 --> 21:17.288
I don't know. Forbes.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.527
He's not here.

21:23.562 --> 21:26.631
Obviously spent a lot
of time here though.

21:28.433 --> 21:30.768
Alton Finn.
Looks like he was

21:30.802 --> 21:33.237
a mini-celebrity
in the tech world.

21:33.272 --> 21:34.838
Although someone who doesn't
have much time to live.

21:34.873 --> 21:36.507
Take a look at this.

21:36.541 --> 21:38.208
It's a brain tumor.

21:38.243 --> 21:40.343
And looks like it's spreading.

21:40.378 --> 21:42.545
From what I can see, it
looks like it's inoperable

21:42.580 --> 21:44.247
from where it's located.

21:44.282 --> 21:46.349
Although...

21:46.384 --> 21:48.351
according to these
notes, it looks like

21:48.386 --> 21:50.387
Alton has found a
way to excise it.

21:50.421 --> 21:52.289
I don't understand.

21:52.323 --> 21:55.024
Why would anyone want
to experiment on him?

21:55.058 --> 21:57.059
How could he become
extraordinary if he's dying?

21:57.094 --> 21:58.661
I don't know.

22:00.798 --> 22:03.065
See these?

22:03.100 --> 22:05.134
The tumor's tentacles
are expanding

22:05.169 --> 22:07.536
into uncharted
areas of his brain.

22:07.570 --> 22:10.439
And activating regions
in impossible ways.

22:10.473 --> 22:11.740
I guess giving him
the ability to...

22:11.775 --> 22:13.709
Overload electricity?

22:13.743 --> 22:14.876
It's what Neuroprosthetics

22:14.911 --> 22:16.278
is based on, right?

22:16.313 --> 22:17.546
The ability of the brain

22:17.580 --> 22:19.915
to control objects wirelessly.

22:19.949 --> 22:21.950
And in Alton's case,
this tumor

22:21.984 --> 22:23.985
is allowing him to take that
to the next level.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.153
So, whoever's behind
these experiments,

22:25.188 --> 22:27.389
they're trying to see how far

22:27.424 --> 22:29.157
they can evolve the
brain, what it can do?

22:29.192 --> 22:30.425
I guess.

22:30.459 --> 22:31.993
It's unbelievable, right?

22:32.028 --> 22:33.461
But why is Alton
doing this?

22:33.495 --> 22:34.963
Why would he hunt down

22:34.997 --> 22:36.564
the courier and fry his brain?

22:36.598 --> 22:37.765
Unless the courier is

22:37.800 --> 22:38.900
just the go-between
to whoever's

22:38.935 --> 22:40.836
experimenting on Alton.

22:40.870 --> 22:42.770
You said Effective
World-Wide Solutions were

22:42.805 --> 22:45.606
in the business
of illicit goods, right?

22:45.641 --> 22:47.608
Yeah, but more like arms, weapons.
- Okay, well,

22:47.643 --> 22:49.344
Muirfield were
experimenting on me

22:49.378 --> 22:51.011
with a serum to turn
me into a weapon.

22:51.046 --> 22:53.180
So, maybe Alton was
getting a serum, too.

22:53.215 --> 22:55.916
But it was cut off when
Agent Thomas intercepted it.

22:55.951 --> 22:57.819
Who then gave it to JT.

23:00.823 --> 23:02.189
(line ringing)

23:02.224 --> 23:03.924
Come on, come on, JT.

23:03.959 --> 23:05.359
Hey, big guy.

23:05.393 --> 23:07.962
Uh, JT, where are you?
Me? I'm at the hospital.

23:07.996 --> 23:10.865
Got a call my miracle medicine's
ready to try.

23:10.899 --> 23:13.800
Okay, who called you, JT?

23:13.835 --> 23:15.836
Who are you? Whoa, hey, hey!
(thuds)

23:16.804 --> 23:17.905
JT, are you there?

23:20.508 --> 23:22.342
JT Forbes?
What do you want?

23:22.377 --> 23:23.443
I want to live.

23:23.478 --> 23:25.144
Even if you have to die.

23:29.087 --> 23:30.706
Ow!
Whoa.

23:30.707 --> 23:32.309
Don't piss me off.

23:32.333 --> 23:33.632
Okay, okay.

23:33.667 --> 23:35.901
Wait. How'd you do that?

23:35.936 --> 23:38.004
Stage 4 neuroblastoma.

23:38.038 --> 23:39.372
Buried in my cerebellar nuclei.

23:39.406 --> 23:40.806
Giving me the ability

23:40.841 --> 23:43.076
to do some crazy-ass things.

23:43.110 --> 23:44.978
Stage 4?
How are you even still alive?

23:45.012 --> 23:47.847
Same reason you are...
apparently. The medicine.

23:47.881 --> 23:49.582
I was sent a dose,
promised another...

23:49.616 --> 23:51.517
Wait, what? What medicine?

23:51.551 --> 23:54.019
The one that was meant
for me, but went to you.

23:54.053 --> 23:55.821
The one that saved your life.
Now, you'd better hope

23:55.856 --> 23:57.155
your version saves me, too.

23:57.190 --> 23:59.692
So, it is the same serum.

23:59.726 --> 24:02.661
Well... how can you be
so sure it'll save you?

24:02.696 --> 24:04.396
Because it saved you.
But if the serum was

24:04.430 --> 24:07.065
meant for you, then you were
a guinea pig, which means...

24:07.100 --> 24:09.034
maybe it reacts
differently in you, maybe

24:09.068 --> 24:11.703
it was meant to supercharge
your-your, uh, tumor cells

24:11.737 --> 24:13.071
to see what would happen...

24:13.106 --> 24:15.073
Ow!
(grunting)

24:17.443 --> 24:19.844
It's supposed to heal me.

24:19.879 --> 24:21.613
You understand?
That's what they promised.

24:21.647 --> 24:23.214
That's what's gonna happen.

24:23.248 --> 24:26.951
(siren wailing)

24:26.986 --> 24:29.086
JT's still not answering.

24:29.121 --> 24:30.588
How long to the hospital
in this traffic?

24:30.623 --> 24:32.123
At least ten.
Call Tess.

24:32.157 --> 24:33.558
What? Are you kidding?

24:33.592 --> 24:35.627
She'll send in
the whole cavalry to save JT.

24:35.661 --> 24:36.895
You've seen what Alton can do.

24:36.929 --> 24:38.596
We are on our own, Cat.

24:38.631 --> 24:40.597
I'm good with that. Are you?

24:40.632 --> 24:42.433
Uh, meaning?

24:42.467 --> 24:44.768
Vincent, be honest.
Something is bothering you.

24:44.802 --> 24:47.371
And you're talking to
everyone else about it but me.

24:47.406 --> 24:49.373
That's not true.
(cell phone rings)

24:49.408 --> 24:50.607
JT?!

24:50.642 --> 24:52.376
HEATHER:
Vincent! Hi, it's me.

24:52.411 --> 24:54.545
Heather?

24:54.579 --> 24:55.879
Hey. Are you all right?

24:55.914 --> 24:57.080
I, uh, I've been
worried about you

24:57.114 --> 24:58.114
ever since you left.

24:58.115 --> 25:00.116
"Left"? Left where?

25:00.151 --> 25:01.985
Cat?
I can explain.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.453
Heather, where are you?

25:03.487 --> 25:05.388
And why are you worried
about Vincent?

25:05.423 --> 25:07.057
I'm in your apartment.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.792
Didn't Vincent tell you
I was back in town?

25:08.826 --> 25:10.661
You told me not to tell her.

25:10.695 --> 25:12.262
No, I told you not to tell her
about the shower.

25:12.296 --> 25:13.629
"Shower"?

25:13.664 --> 25:16.232
What the hell is going on?

25:16.267 --> 25:18.768
Uh, it's just like, uh,
a misunderstanding.

25:18.802 --> 25:20.570
He was only trying to reassure me.
In the shower?

25:20.604 --> 25:21.737
No!
Yes.

25:21.772 --> 25:24.807
No! No! I mean no! I...

25:24.841 --> 25:26.943
Is this a bad time?

25:26.977 --> 25:28.811
Yes!
- No!

25:28.845 --> 25:30.580
See? I knew you two were
having problems.

25:30.614 --> 25:33.415
Okay, Heather, hang up now.
Okay.

25:33.450 --> 25:35.417
But trust me, you just
be patient, all right?

25:35.452 --> 25:36.586
You two are awesome.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.153
And...

25:38.188 --> 25:40.590
uh... Hello?

25:40.624 --> 25:44.159
Okay, so, you talked to
my sister, but not to me?

25:44.194 --> 25:46.161
Catherine, that is not
what happened, okay? (cell phone ringing)

25:46.196 --> 25:49.698
Heather! Please, not now, okay?!

25:49.732 --> 25:51.700
Where's JT?
BOTH: Tess.

25:51.734 --> 25:54.103
Yeah, he just pocket dialed me,
but I can't get through to him.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.137
Is he all right? I'm worried.

25:55.171 --> 25:56.605
No, um...

25:56.639 --> 25:58.840
we think that he may have been

25:58.874 --> 26:00.609
taken hostage at the hospital.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.677
What?! Why?
We'll know more

26:02.712 --> 26:04.312
when we get there.
We'll be there in ten.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.680
All right. I'm on my way.

26:05.715 --> 26:07.115
Just come alone!

26:07.149 --> 26:08.449
We don't want anyone
else to get hurt.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.651
All right.

26:09.685 --> 26:11.853
Vincent?

26:11.887 --> 26:14.155
if you are having second
thoughts about us...

26:14.189 --> 26:15.824
I'm not having second
thoughts, okay? I swear.

26:15.858 --> 26:17.225
I love you. You know that.

26:17.259 --> 26:18.292
Okay, then what the
hell is going on?!

26:18.327 --> 26:20.394
What is the problem?

26:20.429 --> 26:23.297
Apparently, uh,
moving in with you

26:23.332 --> 26:26.300
is causing me
to have a few, uh....

26:26.335 --> 26:29.504
p-primal issues,
if you know what I mean.

26:29.538 --> 26:31.071
Oh! Oh, good.

26:31.106 --> 26:32.406
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

26:32.441 --> 26:33.474
I'm glad that
it's nothing big.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.575
Yeah.

26:34.610 --> 26:35.909
(engine revs, tires screech)

26:35.944 --> 26:38.512
Oh!

26:44.385 --> 26:46.553
How'd you even know I
was making a synthetic?

26:46.587 --> 26:48.756
Agent Thomas told me.

26:48.790 --> 26:51.491
Reluctantly.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.925
After the courier who was
supposed to deliver me

26:52.960 --> 26:54.494
my next dose told me

26:54.529 --> 26:56.496
that Thomas
intercepted it from him.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.499
"Reluctantly"?

26:59.534 --> 27:01.294
All I'm saying is maybe
we should be focusing

27:01.302 --> 27:03.102
on the courier, right?

27:03.137 --> 27:05.539
I mean, maybe he can lead us
to whoever's making this stuff.

27:05.573 --> 27:07.613
Well, I killed him before
he could tell me anything.

27:11.078 --> 27:13.379
Sometimes I-I-I push too hard.

27:13.413 --> 27:14.914
I lose control.

27:14.948 --> 27:17.150
Sounds like a friend of mine.

27:19.787 --> 27:21.087
Pain's getting worse, isn't it?

27:22.422 --> 27:23.890
You seeing white flashes, too?

27:23.924 --> 27:26.058
Yeah.
With increased frequency?

27:26.092 --> 27:27.560
Yeah, you know what?
Can you stop stalling?

27:27.594 --> 27:29.295
Just give me the...
I'm not stalling!

27:29.329 --> 27:31.063
I'm just saying even
if this does work,

27:31.097 --> 27:33.031
it's only one dose,
and, as you said,

27:33.066 --> 27:35.568
if-if the tumor is inoperable,
then it only gives you time.

27:35.602 --> 27:37.869
This could save Agent Thomas.

27:37.904 --> 27:39.438
Give me the damn serum, now!

27:39.472 --> 27:40.772
(electrical crackling)

27:48.486 --> 27:50.486
Maybe if JT beast out,
it'll calm him down.

27:50.511 --> 27:52.245
Unless the serum makes
his tumor grow,

27:52.280 --> 27:53.380
which is obviously
what they want.

27:53.414 --> 27:54.915
Vincent, you can't kill him.

27:54.949 --> 27:56.817
Otherwise we'll have even
bigger primal problems.

27:56.851 --> 28:00.119
Alton's still an innocent.
Not if he hurts JT.

28:00.154 --> 28:02.389
What's going on?
Some maniac's gone nuts in there!

28:02.423 --> 28:04.591
I don't know what the
hell he's doing!!

28:04.625 --> 28:06.926
(electrical crackling)
(people screaming)

28:06.960 --> 28:09.128
JT!

28:09.163 --> 28:11.998
(people shouting)

28:12.032 --> 28:13.400
Damn it!

28:15.368 --> 28:19.105
Vincent!

28:27.547 --> 28:30.816
Sorry... it's too late.

28:30.850 --> 28:33.151
There's no more serum.

28:34.354 --> 28:36.655
No?

28:39.125 --> 28:41.293
It's still in your
blood, isn't it?

28:51.738 --> 28:53.671
I can't hold it much longer!

28:53.706 --> 28:55.340
What's going on?
You got to help me clear this place.

28:55.374 --> 28:56.875
Where's JT?
- He's with the maniac

28:56.909 --> 28:59.144
who's supposed to have
that miracle cure.

28:59.178 --> 29:00.978
TESS: All right, I know how
to clear the room.

29:04.650 --> 29:07.385
Get everyone out of here!
Now! Move!

29:07.419 --> 29:09.854
(growling)

29:09.888 --> 29:11.322
Go! Go!

29:20.198 --> 29:22.699
(JT grunts, groans)

29:35.380 --> 29:37.414
Vincent, what are
you gonna do?

29:37.448 --> 29:40.651
What do you think I'm gonna do. Save JT.
Let us save him.

29:40.685 --> 29:42.319
You're already on the primal edge.
I can't worry

29:42.353 --> 29:44.187
about that right now.
You can't go

29:44.221 --> 29:46.490
one on one with Alton. You've
seen what he's capable of.

29:46.524 --> 29:49.159
Okay, but maybe going primal
is the only way to stop him.

29:49.193 --> 29:50.594
All right, Alton's
tumor allows him

29:50.628 --> 29:51.895
to overload brain waves, right?

29:51.929 --> 29:53.329
But a primal brain
is much simpler.

29:53.363 --> 29:55.198
It has hardly
any brain waves.

29:55.232 --> 29:57.200
So, in theory, I'm not
gonna be as vulnerable.

29:57.234 --> 29:59.714
Vincent, you can't even move in
with me without losing control.

30:02.807 --> 30:04.507
Maybe we have to trust him, Cat.
Can't.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.375
We both have too much to lose.

30:12.282 --> 30:14.550
(groans)

30:18.822 --> 30:20.323
Go!

30:29.098 --> 30:31.900
JT!

30:31.935 --> 30:34.039
I don't think Vincent can
stop Alton, not without...

30:34.063 --> 30:34.736
I know, I know.

30:34.737 --> 30:36.238
Tess, you got to get JT as far
away from Alton as possible.

30:36.272 --> 30:37.539
What are you gonna do?

30:37.573 --> 30:38.807
I'm gonna try
and save both of them.

30:38.842 --> 30:41.176
Go! Hurry!
Come on, come on.

30:42.645 --> 30:44.212
Stop!

30:49.084 --> 30:51.124
You're gonna kill each other,
is that what you want?

30:52.955 --> 30:55.957
Listen to me--

30:55.991 --> 30:59.393
you have the power to fight
whoever turned you into this,

30:59.427 --> 31:02.230
both of you do,
but not if you kill each other.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.234
Don't lose yourself,

31:06.268 --> 31:07.601
don't lose who you really are

31:07.635 --> 31:08.875
and what really matters to you!

31:37.537 --> 31:40.476
Tumor's buried in the occipital lobe
reaching into the fourth ventricle.

31:40.477 --> 31:41.910
How's he supposed
to get that out?

31:41.944 --> 31:43.612
Heck, I don't know,
but he's got to try.

31:43.647 --> 31:45.314
Okay, tell the surgeon
I'm sending him a scan

31:45.348 --> 31:46.649
and a roadmap on
how to proceed.

31:46.683 --> 31:48.450
Who did the map?

31:48.485 --> 31:50.085
The patient.

31:50.119 --> 31:52.154
It's a long story,
please, just go.

31:56.826 --> 31:58.193
Is he gonna be okay?

31:58.227 --> 31:59.227
I don't know.

31:59.228 --> 32:00.628
He's scared, you know,

32:00.663 --> 32:01.997
but he's got a
fighting chance,

32:02.031 --> 32:03.264
but it's a pretty
risky operation.

32:03.299 --> 32:05.100
But at least
it's a chance.

32:05.134 --> 32:08.269
And, in success,
he'll be able to undo

32:08.304 --> 32:10.038
whatever it is
they did to him.

32:10.073 --> 32:11.439
I'd envy that.

32:11.473 --> 32:13.208
I don't know-- I
guess I got to learn

32:13.242 --> 32:14.642
how to live with it, huh?

32:14.677 --> 32:15.776
We both do.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.778
Hey, don't you
ever get tired

32:17.813 --> 32:20.381
of having to talk
me down like that?

32:20.416 --> 32:23.951
Yes, I do, but "for better
or worse," remember?

32:23.985 --> 32:25.286
Still time to run away.

32:25.321 --> 32:26.487
We're only engaged.

32:26.522 --> 32:28.288
Engaged to be married.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.990
I'm not that easy to get rid of.

32:30.025 --> 32:32.492
Okay, I'm counting on that.

32:32.527 --> 32:35.462
I'm gonna go check in on Tess
and JT, do you want to come?

32:35.496 --> 32:36.897
You know what,
I'd love to,

32:36.932 --> 32:39.133
but I got to go check
in on Agent Thomas.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.701
Apparently,
he's awake now.

32:40.736 --> 32:42.302
So, JT came through
after all.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.038
Yeah, yeah.

32:44.072 --> 32:46.340
So, hopefully that means we'll
find out a little bit more

32:46.374 --> 32:47.807
about whoever's behind
these experiments.

32:47.842 --> 32:50.644
I'll see you at home?

32:52.747 --> 32:55.115
Yeah, I'll see
you at home.

33:01.889 --> 33:04.224
(machine beeping rhythmically)

33:08.362 --> 33:11.330
How's he doing?

33:11.365 --> 33:12.932
He's better.

33:12.967 --> 33:14.934
Don't ask me
how, but he is.

33:14.969 --> 33:17.936
Okay, good.

33:17.971 --> 33:19.905
Thanks.

33:22.108 --> 33:24.577
Agent Thomas--

33:24.611 --> 33:27.513
how you feeling today?

33:27.547 --> 33:31.384
Like I've been hit by a truck.

33:31.418 --> 33:33.386
Agent Barnett?

33:33.420 --> 33:37.022
I'm sorry, he-he died last week.

33:37.056 --> 33:40.025
You got to stop this.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.961
You have to find out
who's behind it.

33:42.996 --> 33:44.763
Okay, then you need to help us.

33:44.798 --> 33:46.464
You need to tell us
anything you know,

33:46.499 --> 33:48.300
whoever you think is
behind this.

33:48.334 --> 33:50.302
I don't know.

33:50.336 --> 33:53.705
That's why we needed you--
we couldn't figure it out.

33:53.739 --> 33:55.707
Okay, what about the courier?

33:55.741 --> 33:57.709
The one that you intercepted
to get the medicine

33:57.743 --> 34:00.044
to save my friend--
who sent him?

34:00.078 --> 34:02.046
I don't know.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.115
We were working on some leads...
(gasps)

34:04.149 --> 34:06.150
Okay, it's all right,
take it easy, take it easy.

34:06.185 --> 34:07.718
You've been through a lot.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.790
Where'd your friend get
the serum to save me?

34:12.824 --> 34:14.792
He made it.

34:14.827 --> 34:17.228
With his own blood
from what you saved him with.

34:17.262 --> 34:18.896
Be careful.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.597
Of what?

34:20.632 --> 34:22.132
Of your friend.

34:22.167 --> 34:24.335
Okay? It may
have healed him,

34:24.369 --> 34:26.969
but it's all part
of the same serum,

34:27.004 --> 34:28.972
the same experiment.

34:29.005 --> 34:30.306
Okay, what do you mean?

34:30.342 --> 34:31.908
(labored breathing)

34:31.943 --> 34:34.010
Agent Thomas, what do you mean?

34:34.045 --> 34:36.780
Okay, okay,
just breath easy.

34:36.815 --> 34:37.848
Relax.

34:37.882 --> 34:39.416
Breathe easy.

34:47.158 --> 34:49.259
♪

34:52.830 --> 34:54.864
Damn it.

34:54.899 --> 34:56.333
You're better
than me, too.

34:56.367 --> 34:58.000
Well, in fairness,
I am a cop.

34:58.034 --> 35:00.034
Well, still, I've been
playing this game for years.

35:00.036 --> 35:01.704
Are you sure this
is your first time?

35:01.739 --> 35:03.706
JT, it's just
a game, okay?

35:03.741 --> 35:06.876
Plus, you nearly died again,
so there's that.

35:06.910 --> 35:08.878
I know, I know, but...

35:08.912 --> 35:10.646
But what?

35:12.883 --> 35:14.816
I'm just confused,
I guess.

35:15.919 --> 35:17.853
Okay.

35:17.888 --> 35:21.556
On one hand, whatever saved me
saved Agent Thomas, too.

35:21.591 --> 35:23.893
On the other hand, if it's
connected to the experiments,

35:23.927 --> 35:25.895
I keep wondering if...

35:25.929 --> 35:28.230
You should be some kind
of superhuman, too.

35:28.265 --> 35:29.831
Yeah, kind of.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.332
Look, we've been
over this.

35:31.367 --> 35:34.335
All I know is that when
you stood up to my brothers,

35:34.370 --> 35:37.171
that was you, not some
crazy-ass serum, you.

35:37.206 --> 35:39.240
How can you be sure?

35:39.275 --> 35:40.909
I've been with you
long enough to know

35:40.943 --> 35:43.311
who you really are,
okay?

35:43.345 --> 35:44.745
You know, you might
present yourself

35:44.747 --> 35:46.147
as this cliché
nerdy professor...

35:46.181 --> 35:47.315
(laughs sarcastically)

35:47.349 --> 35:48.716
Thanks a lot.

35:48.750 --> 35:49.884
But you're
more than that.

35:49.919 --> 35:51.485
A lot more.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.587
Why can't you
just accept that?

35:53.622 --> 35:56.590
I don't know, maybe because
I've spent half my life

35:56.625 --> 35:58.559
being the cliché
nerdy professor?

35:58.593 --> 36:00.995
Well, look, I hate
to burst your bubble, JT,

36:01.030 --> 36:03.597
but, like I said,
you sell yourself short.

36:03.632 --> 36:04.632
No, I don't.

36:04.633 --> 36:05.633
Yes, you do.

36:05.634 --> 36:07.601
And you know what?

36:07.636 --> 36:09.036
What?

36:09.070 --> 36:12.840
Because of you,
and how much you inspired me,

36:12.874 --> 36:15.175
I'm actually thinking
of throwing my hat in the ring.

36:15.209 --> 36:16.376
Wait, for captain?

36:16.411 --> 36:17.945
Yeah.

36:17.979 --> 36:19.379
What?!

36:19.414 --> 36:20.948
I mean, I totally
won't get it,

36:20.982 --> 36:22.950
but, like, I have
to do something

36:22.984 --> 36:25.218
to avoid having to work
for my brother.

36:25.253 --> 36:27.687
Good for you.

36:27.721 --> 36:28.721
Thanks.

36:28.756 --> 36:30.123
I owe it all to you.

36:30.158 --> 36:31.258
Yeah?

36:31.292 --> 36:33.560
Yeah.

36:33.594 --> 36:35.395
Well, in that case,

36:35.430 --> 36:37.396
can you teach me how
the hell to shoot?

36:37.431 --> 36:39.766
All right, all right,
all right.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.200
Okay.

36:41.234 --> 36:42.535
Just relax
your shoulders a little.

36:42.570 --> 36:43.937
Damn.

36:43.971 --> 36:45.104
Nerdy cliché
professor's dream.

36:45.138 --> 36:46.739
Look at that,
see that? Shh.

36:46.774 --> 36:48.107
What?!
- You got to focus.

36:49.443 --> 36:50.443
(knocking on door)

36:50.444 --> 36:52.244
Cat?
- Over here.

36:52.279 --> 36:53.212
Hey.

36:53.246 --> 36:54.246
Hey.

36:54.247 --> 36:55.547
Mad at me?

36:55.582 --> 36:56.915
For showering
with my fiancé?

36:56.950 --> 36:58.050
(laughs)
Just kidding.

36:59.152 --> 37:00.286
Vincent explained
it to me.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.553
Finally.

37:01.588 --> 37:03.055
I should have
called you,

37:03.090 --> 37:04.923
let you know I was
coming back in town.

37:04.958 --> 37:06.325
Yeah, well, one
thing's for sure--

37:06.360 --> 37:08.060
you're gonna have to
turn over your key.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.728
Man in the house.

37:09.762 --> 37:11.162
I hope.

37:11.197 --> 37:13.331
What? You don't have
to worry about Vincent.

37:13.366 --> 37:15.501
He loves you
so much, Cat, okay?

37:15.535 --> 37:17.469
Nothing's ever gonna get
in the way of that.

37:17.504 --> 37:18.770
Yeah, sometimes
I'm not so sure.

37:18.805 --> 37:21.072
How can you say that?

37:21.107 --> 37:22.908
Especially after everything
you guys have been through.

37:22.942 --> 37:24.910
Fighting beasts and
bad guys is one thing,

37:24.944 --> 37:26.411
this normal
stuff is hard.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.745
(laughs)

37:27.779 --> 37:29.414
It's supposed to be.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.082
That's how you find out
whether or not

37:31.117 --> 37:33.084
you're supposed
to be married.

37:33.119 --> 37:34.952
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:34.987 --> 37:37.522
I just realized, we haven't even
had a chance to talk about...

37:37.556 --> 37:38.956
No, it's...
it's okay.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.425
Really.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.126
I mean, honestly,
I'm relieved.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.997
I barely even knew Matthew
when we got engaged.

37:46.031 --> 37:49.199
It's the wrong time
to be impulsive, I guess.

37:49.234 --> 37:52.603
Besides, compared to what
you and Vincent have,

37:52.638 --> 37:54.138
Matthew and I didn't
even come close.

38:00.245 --> 38:02.812
Uh, I'm not interrupting, am I?

38:02.847 --> 38:06.550
No, I was just leaving.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.485
Oh, and I'm staying
at Janet's, so call me.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.520
Okay.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.455
Bye.
- Bye.

38:15.259 --> 38:17.861
You're not packing up
my stuff, are you?

38:17.895 --> 38:19.796
No, I'm packing up
<i>my</i> things.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.397
Making some room
for you.

38:21.432 --> 38:24.333
Including your really
ugly lamp.

38:24.368 --> 38:25.535
There. Happy?

38:25.570 --> 38:28.071
I got that thing
at a garage sale.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.440
Really?
Yeah.

38:31.675 --> 38:33.342
You okay?

38:33.377 --> 38:36.011
Yeah, yeah, I am.

38:36.046 --> 38:38.847
You know, if you're okay
with talking me down

38:38.882 --> 38:40.716
from this ledge sometimes, too.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.851
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

38:42.886 --> 38:44.853
this commitment stuff
scares me, too.

38:44.888 --> 38:46.689
Yeah, but you
don't beast out.

38:46.723 --> 38:49.658
Yeah, but you haven't seen me
in the mornings much, yet.

38:49.693 --> 38:53.662
Well, then, I guess we'll both
have to take our chances.

38:53.697 --> 38:55.931
Vincent, we've got to learn
to talk to each other better

38:55.966 --> 38:57.733
about the stuff that bothers us,

38:57.767 --> 38:59.668
especially now that we're
going to be living together.

38:59.703 --> 39:00.836
I know.

39:00.870 --> 39:02.270
I know you're right.

39:02.305 --> 39:04.872
And I-I wanted to talk
to you about it, I did,

39:04.907 --> 39:06.408
but I just...

39:06.442 --> 39:09.377
I was just so afraid
that I'd scare you off.

39:09.412 --> 39:10.745
Never.

39:12.381 --> 39:14.349
Living together, being engaged--

39:14.383 --> 39:17.352
it's not just about the perks.

39:17.386 --> 39:19.854
And that's a big adjustment
for me, too.

39:19.888 --> 39:21.355
Right.

39:21.389 --> 39:23.424
But maybe we could just
focus on the perks?

39:23.458 --> 39:24.759
No.

39:24.793 --> 39:28.763
Unless you have something
specific in mind.

39:28.797 --> 39:30.431
Do you want to
play a video game?

39:30.465 --> 39:32.466
Do you want me
to break your lamp?

39:32.501 --> 39:33.501
Mm, sounds good.

39:34.737 --> 39:36.971
(laughs)

39:37.006 --> 39:38.439
(cell phone rings)

39:38.473 --> 39:39.740
Mm, no.

39:39.774 --> 39:40.874
No, don't. Don't.

39:40.908 --> 39:42.610
Don't answer
it, Catherine.

39:42.644 --> 39:43.710
Please.
- Mm.

39:43.745 --> 39:45.679
Ah, yes.

39:49.351 --> 39:50.551
(phone rings)
(groans)

39:50.585 --> 39:51.619
Don't.

39:51.653 --> 39:52.719
No, no.

39:52.754 --> 39:53.954
No.
- It's Tess.

39:56.024 --> 39:58.125
Hey, what's going on?

39:58.159 --> 39:59.492
You better get back
to the hospital.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.394
The hospital? What happened?

40:01.428 --> 40:03.697
Somebody shot Agent Thomas.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.468
He's dead.
