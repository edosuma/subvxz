Ne-yo!

09:45.460 --> 09:46.376
Good one, son.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.380

my "masked dancer" costars,

09:50.424 --> 09:53.216
craig robinson on the piano,

09:53.260 --> 09:57.387

- Nicole: Not from banana!

10:06.231 --> 10:10.358
- You saw that. You saw that.
- That's how craig robinson
would react.

10:10.360 --> 10:15.405
No, it's because
there was a little clue
when she said "the ball,"

10:15.407 --> 10:19.117
which I thought possibly
camila cabello and shawn mendes

10:19.161 --> 10:21.119
because she's in
the new "cinderella" movie.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.289
But her frame,
she's not as tall as--

10:24.333 --> 10:27.000
well,
this is "the masked singer,"
they could disguise it.

10:27.044 --> 10:31.046

- He's waiting.
- Yeah, they're saving it
for later.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.857

If you could give your past self
some dating advice,
what would it be?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.821
- Okay--

- All right, cupcake,

now which one of our panelists

15:10.827 --> 15:12.994

15:13.038 --> 15:15.997
I think I would connect
with you, nick.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.957
- All: Oh!
- That's what I'm talking about.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.334
I see!

15:19.336 --> 15:21.836
We both got double trouble.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.755
Ah, oh.
We both got double trouble.

15:23.798 --> 15:27.800
- Double trouble?
- That could be--
I have two sets of twins.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.844
So is she a twin
or does she have twins?

15:29.888 --> 15:31.846
Y'all figure that out.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.056
That's our job.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.308
What about
the double trouble mom?

15:35.352 --> 15:37.644
"sister, sister."
what's her name?
Jackie, is it?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.062
- Jackée, jackée.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

15:39.064 --> 15:41.230
- Nicole: Could be.
- Oh, that's not bad.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.358
But when I saw that needle
and thread,

15:43.360 --> 15:47.070
it made me think
a fashion designer or
former super model.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.529
It could be grace jones.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.823
- Ooh.
- Right?

15:50.867 --> 15:54.786
- Icon.
- I mean, I do think this is
someone who is iconic,

15:54.829 --> 15:59.040
but I am honestly thinking
this could be tina turner,
living legend.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.333
No.

16:00.335 --> 16:04.003
Ken:
The quality of her voice--
hear me out.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.080
She's been married
multiple times.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.131
Things kinda of fit
in the clue package.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.217
- Let me tell you
why you're wrong.
- Yeah.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.135
She lives in switzerland.

16:11.179 --> 16:15.473
We drove to costco together
from sherman oaks.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.808
Well, I brought cupcakes for
anyone who has a great guess,

16:16.810 --> 16:17.850
and obviously
ken's not getting one.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.646
- So I'll have yours.
- Cupcake for you, nicole?

16:21.690 --> 16:23.356
We got a new clue this week
with the thread and needle.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.317
I'm thinking tina knowles, okay?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.987
- Oh!
- Beyoncé knowles' mother.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.865
She been dressing
destiny's child and beyoncé
since "bug a boo."

16:32.909 --> 16:35.535
- I like it.
- Nick: All right.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.247
- Thank you, jenny, so much.
- You're welcome.

16:39.290 --> 16:42.291
- Oh, it's gonna be delicious.
- Ken: Okay. All right.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.962
All right, well,
we had a cupcake tonight,
and it was delicious.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.589
Y'all make some noise
for cupcake.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.300
Jenny:
Do you guys remember last
time we saw cupcake onstage,

16:51.344 --> 16:54.012
she told us all
that she was supposed
to be here with someone.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.597
- Does tina turner match that--
- no.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.142
Okay, I was just asking, guys.
She's a neighbor. How dare you?

16:59.185 --> 17:01.352

We would both have

21:44.137 --> 21:47.179
Roasting hot.
Does that give you
anything, ken?

21:47.223 --> 21:49.265
You know what, I did
the roast of alec baldwin,

21:49.309 --> 21:54.186
and his daughter
is an amazing singer.

21:54.188 --> 21:58.691
This could be
ireland baldwin possibly.

21:58.735 --> 21:59.942
Robin: That's a good guess,

22:00.278 --> 22:04.155
but there's a person that came
to mind when I saw the rock

22:04.198 --> 22:05.906
and who's very talented actress

22:05.950 --> 22:09.493
but also comes from
a very musical family,

22:09.537 --> 22:10.870
and that's ashley judd.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.289
It could be ashley judd
under there.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.374
- Nick: Ooh.
- Jenny: Could be, could be.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.542
- But she's not
the one in the group.
- Is she single?

22:16.586 --> 22:18.753
- She's not wynonna or--
- but she's a judd.

22:18.796 --> 22:19.962
- Nick: She's a judd.
- Jenny: She's a judd.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.965
- All the judds can sang.
- Robin: They got judd vocals.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.967
Yes, but can you
connect her to the rock?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.719
Yes, they were in
"the tooth fairy" together.

22:26.763 --> 22:30.264
- All: Oh!
- Nicole: Okay,
that's not bad,

22:30.308 --> 22:33.351
but vocally
I was thinking gaga,

22:33.394 --> 22:35.478
because that's one
of her favorite songs,

22:35.521 --> 22:37.855
- "la vie en rose."
she even put it--
- jenny: In the movie.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.273
In the movie
"a star is born."

22:39.650 --> 22:42.151
and then I was thinking
when she said something
about the speed dating

22:42.195 --> 22:44.320
with the motorcycles
and the hiking,

22:44.364 --> 22:47.990
I was like,
"could it be someone
like miley cyrus?"

22:48.034 --> 22:50.659
- because miley
can sing, y'all.
- Ken: Miley can go.

- Fourth grade?
- Aw, that's so sweet.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.800
I still can remember
the first day I saw her

23:47.844 --> 23:50.177
with a big curly hair,
and I was like,

23:50.221 --> 23:54.348
"that looks like a big old
glass of iced tea."

the same wavelength.

All right, well, robin,
you were about to jump
the gun on this date.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.236
Robin was jumping
up and down.

28:17.279 --> 28:20.030
So I'm thinking
about famous couples

28:20.074 --> 28:21.323
that we know that
have been together forever,

28:21.367 --> 28:23.242
and then he said dimples.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.954
And I think this might be

28:26.956 --> 28:28.372
the husband
of sarah michelle geller.

it's freddie prinze jr.

- But he can sing.
Freddie prinze jr.--
- Dimples.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.342
- Freddie prinze jr.
- Ken: But you know
who I think?

28:40.344 --> 28:43.220
Last time that the mallard
was on, with chris pratt,

28:43.222 --> 28:46.765
I actually
thought this too late
after of the show.

28:46.809 --> 28:49.268
I was thinking, oh, my god,
this could be nick offerman,

28:49.311 --> 28:52.938

from "parks and rec,"

28:52.940 --> 28:54.815

28:54.859 --> 28:58.026
is a singer,
married to megan mullally.

you're wrong real quick.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.087

on that stage?

33:59.872 --> 34:02.956
That was definitely worth
the standing ovation
you just received.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.666
Which hand can I shake?
I'll shake them all.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.835
- Shake them all.
Shake them all, nick.
- Shake them all.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.170
Jenny, you got some words?

34:08.213 --> 34:10.130
You definitely touched
my heart strings.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.882
I definitely
got all the feels.

34:11.925 --> 34:15.927
And to me, this seemed like
a frontrunner performance,
you guys.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.346
Wild card came out swinging.

34:18.390 --> 34:23.060
Okay, it's time for the panel's
first impression guesses.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.979
We have a caterpillar catapult.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.064

34:29.068 --> 34:31.109

with your best shot.

34:31.153 --> 34:33.528
All right, baby.

34:47.211 --> 34:49.294
Don't take my jacket off first.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.172
Robin: Yeah!

Uh, probably.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.883
Asking rapid fire questions.

Do you prefer to call or text?

35:42.516 --> 35:44.558
Text. Don't call me.

a freaking caterpillar costume.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.066
- He's funny.
- Which one of these panelists

35:53.110 --> 35:54.943
wiggled their way
into your heart?

35:54.987 --> 35:56.862
I'm into robin.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.281
- Oh! I have a date!
- Ken: Whoa.

35:59.324 --> 36:03.994
'cause I can't take my eyes
off all his printed shirts.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.079
- Ken: Ah!
- The printed pattern.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.122
Did that help you
at all, robin?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.583
You know, that doesn't help,

36:09.626 --> 36:13.086
but in the package, we saw
a basketball thing, right?

36:13.130 --> 36:16.298
And so it could mean bb.
Backstreet boys, right?

36:16.341 --> 36:19.926
Okay. The personality,
the sense of humor, the voice,

36:19.970 --> 36:21.303
I think it might be howie d.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.639
- That's my guess.
- Okay.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.184
That's a good guess,
but did howie d go to jail?

36:27.227 --> 36:28.852
Well, I mean, you know.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.270
They're from the backstreet.
They're tough.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.855
Yeah, they all went to jail.

36:31.899 --> 36:32.981
Whoa, nick.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.482
Sarcastic ne-yo's
in the house.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.067
How dare you?

36:37.112 --> 36:38.153
Nicole: Oh, my god.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.988
That's gonna be
my new hashtag.

36:40.032 --> 36:43.950
- But I was thinking maybe
someone backstreet adjacent.
- Right.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.077
Maybe somebody
like aaron carter.

36:46.079 --> 36:49.331
And aaron carter
I believe has done time,

36:49.374 --> 36:51.958
but he's always been
an amazing talent.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.378
I do really feel
like this is a boy bander.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.881
I just can't decide
on which one.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.257
Right.

36:59.301 --> 37:02.844
But because aj from
backstreet boys is the bad boy,

37:02.888 --> 37:04.679
I think I'll go with aj.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.348
Ken: Okay. Yeah, okay.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.017
I got mine mixed up.
Aj was the one I'm thinking
about, yeah.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.311
You know what?
I'm thinking it's aj, too.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.938
- I really do think--
- let's all get on it.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.189
They like following your lead.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.900

It's season six.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.903
Well, no one can follow
the caterpillar with
that great performance.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.196
Y'all make some noise.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.159

Eek!

Oh, my gosh.

to see who you are.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.525

let us retrieve the panel's

38:46.199 --> 38:47.324
first impression guesses
from the vault.

38:47.326 --> 38:50.118

to do that today.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.005
Here comes the gut punch.

39:02.049 --> 39:04.924
Ken, your first
impression guess,

39:04.968 --> 39:06.926
angela bassett.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.219
Ken: Oh!

39:08.263 --> 39:10.263
I've honestly been going
back and forth

39:10.307 --> 39:13.933
between angela bassett
and tina turner,

39:13.935 --> 39:16.478
but just something in my gut

39:16.480 --> 39:20.774
is telling me that cupcake
is tina turner.

39:20.817 --> 39:24.069
- Okay, and he's serious.
- He's dead serious too.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.195
- Okay.
- Yeah.

39:25.238 --> 39:29.157
And nicole? Roberta flack.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.283
Are you sticking with it?

39:30.327 --> 39:32.118
- Oh, that's good.
- I dig it.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.661
I'm not sticking with it, nick.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.788
Okay.

39:35.082 --> 39:39.209
Because I'm out for blood
this season, guys, okay?

39:39.252 --> 39:41.920
- Oh!
- ( hisses )

39:43.215 --> 39:45.382
they're used to being
with other people, right?

39:45.425 --> 39:46.716
- Yes.
- From a group.

39:46.760 --> 39:50.178
So I'm like, "who is from
a group from that era?"

39:50.222 --> 39:53.765
okay? The pointer sisters.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.183
Ooh!

39:55.227 --> 39:57.644

- Possibly.
- ♪ jump in,

was rupaul.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.039
It was.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.457
Nick: Are you
sticking with that?

40:19.751 --> 40:23.753
- No, I just have a feeling
that this is a comedian.
- Really?

40:23.755 --> 40:25.380
Robin: The jokes that
she was throwing out when
you guys were talking,

40:25.424 --> 40:27.382
I think it might be
leslie jones.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.217
All right, from rupaul
to leslie jones.

40:29.219 --> 40:32.262
I was kinda getting that vibe
last time too.

40:32.305 --> 40:36.766
Jenny, you also chose rupaul
as your first impression guess.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.268
- Right?
- Nicole: Oh!

40:41.982 --> 40:43.606

40:43.650 --> 40:47.110
that needle and thread just
reminded me of a fashion icon,

40:47.154 --> 40:49.320

it could be grace jones.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.615
Okay.

Okay, panel, now let's see if

Hey, y'all!

Miss pointer,
I have to say this,

41:38.079 --> 41:39.913
you actually
threw everyone off,

41:39.956 --> 41:43.458
because originally
you were supposed to be
here with your sister.

41:43.460 --> 41:46.294
Yeah, she was.
There were supposed to be
two cupcakes.

41:46.338 --> 41:50.924
And anita's having
some health issues
that we couldn't avoid,

41:50.967 --> 41:54.761
so I ended up
doing it by myself.

41:54.804 --> 41:58.264
Solo. Wow.
That's a true performer.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.850
But I would love for you to look
at that camera right there
