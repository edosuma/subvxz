- Damn it, Paige.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.549
I would appreciate it
if you didn't practice on me.

00:35.649 --> 00:37.132
I may be dead,
but it still hurts!

00:37.232 --> 00:40.674
I am sorry, Leo, but I
came up with a perfect way
to vanquish Cole.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.802
I kept thinking,
"What is it that makes him
so indestructible?"

00:44.902 --> 00:47.012
Then I thought,
"It's his protection shield."

00:47.112 --> 00:50.639
So I came up with a potion
that makes me invisible
long enough

00:50.739 --> 00:54.098
so I can get past it,
say a spell, and blow him up
from the inside.

00:54.198 --> 00:56.516
Firstly, congratulations.
Cool potion.

00:56.616 --> 00:58.934
- Thank you.
- Secondly, it will never work.

00:59.034 --> 01:01.977
Okay, even if it does,
it's not something
you should be going at alone.

is, it lies within

Besides, I'm a witch too

to operate on my own

No, I don't know that, Leo.

I have worked really hard
on this, by myself, for days.

at the same time?

didn't see that.

Well, it's one thing to know
and it's another thing
to actually see it.

why it happened. What caused it?

- Paige, you could have been
killed.

So, what else is new?
I just wanted to give you
a little peace.

That's very sweet but I don't
need Cole to be vanquished
to find peace.

I'm okay, really.
I am free of him emotionally.

05:44.916 --> 05:48.444
And besides, I thought we agreed
to take a vanquishing hiatus
during my last trimester?

- That's why I didn't wanna
bother you.
- You should have.

Because this is not something
you can do by yourself.

why now,

06:22.476 --> 06:23.834
after all this time?

You have unlimited powers,
don't you?

to elevate powers such as yours.

restraints of good and evil.

06:33.938 --> 06:35.839
Which makes them unlimited,
yes?

06:35.939 --> 06:39.276
- Yes.
- Then that's why for now.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.842
Which means, I assume,
that I can use these powers

06:42.942 --> 06:45.944
to manipulate say, time?

06:46.612 --> 06:47.945
Reality, even?

06:49.238 --> 06:51.514
Understand, Cole, these powers

06:51.615 --> 06:54.848
are not meant to be used
for personal vendettas.

indeed.

And believe me, I'm all for it.
But I need to take care of
something first.

I need unlimited powers.

allowed.

I just don't understand how
all this could have happened.

15:10.847 --> 15:12.247
How what could've happened?

15:12.347 --> 15:14.290
This. Piper's club.
It's totaled.

15:14.390 --> 15:16.624
Doesn't that strike you
as the least bit odd?

15:16.724 --> 15:17.917
You know Piper?

15:18.017 --> 15:20.543
Of course. Leo, the club.

15:20.643 --> 15:23.084
What about it?
It's been like this
for over a year.

15:23.184 --> 15:25.838
Ever since Piper walked away
from it, right after Prue died.

15:25.938 --> 15:27.296
That is not true.

15:27.396 --> 15:29.213
The club is kicking ass.

15:29.313 --> 15:32.565
Michelle Branch was just playing
here when I sneezed
and then I or--

15:33.732 --> 15:36.091

Maybe if I sneeze again.

15:42.361 --> 15:45.138
How do you know about orbing?
And Piper?

15:45.238 --> 15:49.031
Just take me to her.
She'll figure all this out.
She always does.

got to lose?

Unfreeze me, witch.

Sure. No problem.
Just as soon as you tell me
where I can find Shax.

16:46.142 --> 16:49.001
Shax? What's she talking about?
We vanquished him already.

16:49.101 --> 16:50.668
Nobody's vanquished Shax.

16:50.768 --> 16:52.252
Ever since he killed Prue,

16:52.352 --> 16:54.437
Piper's been obsessed
with getting revenge on him.

16:55.895 --> 16:57.938
[SCREAMS]

16:59.229 --> 17:00.381

Wrong answer.

Okay.

We can do this all night long

17:12.234 --> 17:13.887
because, God knows,
I got nothing but time.

17:13.988 --> 17:15.136
But I'd rather be killing Shax,

where I can find him.

from the Elders

17:51.253 --> 17:53.697

Tell them to shove it.

17:53.797 --> 17:55.657

you didn't really vanquish
the Lazarus demon?

cast a pretty powerful spell
