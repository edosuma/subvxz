WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:07.757
[rain falling]

00:08.717 --> 00:10.051
[thunder rumbling]

00:17.142 --> 00:18.727
[man]  After I lost my parents...

00:19.352 --> 00:22.230
I felt very unmoored and crazy.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.944
That night in July
when that happened, I-I...

00:28.028 --> 00:30.321
It... I can't even describe it.

00:31.364 --> 00:35.410
All standards were lost
at that point of reality.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.288
The unimaginable happened.

00:45.253 --> 00:50.675
The world that Mr. Big creates
is this incredibly elaborate one,

00:50.759 --> 00:54.679
in which this international
crime organization

00:54.763 --> 00:58.308
has this enormous power and...

00:58.933 --> 01:00.643
We were, like, really young and...

01:00.727 --> 01:03.313
reality had, in part,
come from films like  Goodfellas.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.445
It creates this pervasive illusion

01:10.528 --> 01:14.657
that the only options you have
are the ones that they're holding out.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.384
[man]  This undercover operation
doesn't work...

01:34.385 --> 01:38.556
unless the killers have a problem
with which they need help.

01:40.433 --> 01:44.103
So, Al, in no uncertain terms,
told Burns that if he wanted his help

01:44.687 --> 01:47.857
getting rid of that hair
and DNA evidence in Bellevue,

01:47.941 --> 01:50.819
he was going to have to tell him
exactly what went down

01:50.902 --> 01:53.154
so that he knew
what he needed to get rid of.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.197
[device clicks]

01:56.241 --> 01:59.577
[Al]  So, when'd you fucking
do the dirty deed?

02:01.704 --> 02:03.289
[Burns]  During the movie.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.807
[Al] See you left that out, see?
I'm trying to check up on things.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.809
You didn't tell me
that you left the movie...

02:22.892 --> 02:24.602
You left during the movie?

02:24.686 --> 02:27.021
Sorry, I thought
you would've known that just from--

02:27.105 --> 02:28.314
I thought you'd just take it for granted.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.650
[Al] No, I didn't take
fuck all for granted.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.069
So, they got a story. The story's false.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.489
The story doesn't match any evidence.
It doesn't make any sense.

02:37.073 --> 02:41.953
They do whatever they can
to obtain a confession.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.955
[Al] So, what's this about the shower?

02:45.290 --> 02:49.210
I took a shower to clean off,
you know, blood and that kind of stuff.

02:49.294 --> 02:53.381
The boys were called "people of interest"
for, at that point, months.

02:53.464 --> 02:56.926
And the murder weapon was
in some of the news reports.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.470
[Al] So, how do you know these weapons--?
Well, what'd you use?

02:59.554 --> 03:00.388
A bat.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.808
[Al] Okay, how did you know
they didn't find it?

03:03.892 --> 03:08.104
Well, I-I... I don't know, but, um...

03:08.438 --> 03:12.317
pretty early on, they kept saying that
they haven't found the murder weapon yet.

03:12.901 --> 03:13.735
[indistinct chatter]

03:14.319 --> 03:16.613
They kept saying they hadn't--
in the press and stuff and whatever--

03:16.696 --> 03:18.698
They kept saying they hadn't found
the murder weapon yet.

03:18.781 --> 03:22.577
And... that could be just some front
or something, but I...

03:22.660 --> 03:24.162
[Al]  They're not gonna find your clothes?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.205
They're not gonna--?
Is there blood on your clothes?

03:26.873 --> 03:27.707
[Burns]  Um...

03:29.292 --> 03:30.293
No, there wasn't.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.254
Those clothes are gone anyhow,
but, no, there was no blood on them.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.923
-[Al] There was no blood on 'em?
-No.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.383
[Al] How do you fuckin' hit someone
with a baseball bat,

03:37.467 --> 03:39.552
have to shower and have no blood on you?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.054
You do it naked.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.473
[Al] Fuck, see, I didn't know that either.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.060
See, fuckin'-- You're holding
fucking things out on me that--

03:47.143 --> 03:48.686
No, what you're saying to me, like...

03:48.770 --> 03:50.980
"Oh, well, what do I need to know?" And--

03:51.064 --> 03:52.523
[Al] Well, yeah. I wanna know.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.525
I don't give two fucks
if you did it naked.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.652
That's thinking smart.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.240
It's little details like that
that are gonna fuck us up in the end.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.324
See what I'm saying?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.202
You see why I get a little pissed off?

04:04.285 --> 04:06.162
'Cause I can't afford fuckups.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.790
Okay, actually,
I just remembered one detail. Sorry.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.416
Um...

04:10.875 --> 04:11.960
I had a gonch on.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.672
[Al] Great. Where's those gonch?

04:15.755 --> 04:18.132
Just, like, in some garbage can
or something.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.093
[Al] They're not the fucking boxer shorts
that are in the dryer

04:20.176 --> 04:23.179
-or whatever they're talking about there?
-No. Definitely fucking not.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.347
[Al] Okay.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.015
[Levin]  If you looked at the video,

04:26.099 --> 04:28.893
Burns is doing typical
criminal braggadocio.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.603
"Now let me break off here for a second."

04:30.687 --> 04:33.648
Criminal braggadocio...
I'll use a case, for example.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.361
D.E.A. headquarters
asked me to play Mr. Big

04:38.444 --> 04:42.699
in an undercover sting operation
targeting corrupt D.E.A. agents.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.952
I posed as Mr. Big, a Mafioso.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.621
Met one of these D.E.A. agents.

04:49.664 --> 04:54.919
And he so wanted to impress me
that he said things on camera

04:55.003 --> 04:57.714
that would've gotten him
indicted for homicide

04:57.797 --> 04:59.424
or conspiracy to murder.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.592
Like Burns.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.096
Only this is an experienced
D.E.A. undercover agent,

05:05.179 --> 05:06.889
not a 19-year-old.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.018
And the reason I say that is to show you
how vulnerable people are

05:10.101 --> 05:13.146
in the right situation to brag.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.439
Even though it's a lie.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.108
Criminal braggadocio is common as dirt.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.736
[Al] How solid's Atif?

05:20.695 --> 05:21.571
Solid, man.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.366
[Al] Yeah? As long as he's not gonna
fuckin' break down after and say,

05:25.450 --> 05:27.493
-"Oh, fuckin' Sebastian--"
-Jesus Christ.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.663
Al, man. How long do you think
we've been enduring all this stuff, dude?

05:30.747 --> 05:34.667
Really, like, this-- I-- I, really--
I do not think that anything that--

05:34.751 --> 05:37.628
that's gonna happen to us now
is gonna compare to that fuckin'--

05:37.712 --> 05:39.672
It was-- It was quite intense
around those days.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.718
I mean, we'd just sit around
and feel kind of sick, just all the time.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.761
[laughs]

05:44.844 --> 05:48.347
You know what I mean? 'Cause, like,
you know, it was just rough and, like,

05:48.431 --> 05:49.849
I mean...

05:49.932 --> 05:51.309
Whatever. Those would be the days--

05:51.392 --> 05:54.270
Like, cops were saying
to his fucking face, like,

05:54.353 --> 05:55.730
[in deep voice] "Atif...

05:55.813 --> 05:57.857
we know that you know who did this

05:57.940 --> 06:00.443
or that you know something about it
and you're not telling us," and stuff.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.486
And I'm like--

06:01.569 --> 06:04.197
[Al] I gotta meet him before too long.
I'll tell you that right now.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.743
'Cause when we enact this plan in motion,
I gotta make sure that cocksucker's solid.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.828
I mean, fuckin' solid.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.039
Well, I haven't told him
about it yet, but...

06:13.122 --> 06:15.833
[Al] Well, no,
we'll be telling him together.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.877
They demanded that he bring in Atif...

06:18.878 --> 06:21.172
because they needed the corroboration.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.968
[Burns]  This is, uh... Al over here.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.887
-[Atif]  Hello.
-[Al]  How you doin', man?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.764
[Atif]  Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:30.848 --> 06:34.185
The entire undercover operation
was focused on Burns,

06:34.268 --> 06:37.063
but Rafay was never there.

06:37.146 --> 06:40.399
The first time
that Rafay ever met Gary and Al

06:40.483 --> 06:43.486
was the morning after Burns
confessed to these murders.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.948
[Al] I don't know what Sebastian's
told you about me.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.366
Um...

06:49.033 --> 06:51.786
Well, he just introduced me,
said your name's Al...

06:51.869 --> 06:53.121
[Al] Before that, before today.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.580
Um...

06:56.249 --> 06:59.752
That, uh, you're a businessman
of some kind?

06:59.836 --> 07:04.590
It felt like these mobsters had sort
of  Alice in Wonderland -style--

07:04.674 --> 07:07.718
just opened up this whole 'nother view

07:07.802 --> 07:10.263
of what the surface
of the world looked like,

07:10.346 --> 07:13.558
so that, all of a sudden,
I fully believed that the police

07:13.641 --> 07:14.809
were actively framing us

07:14.892 --> 07:20.314
and that these guys had the only way
of keeping us from being arrested.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.819
[Al] You and Sebastian
are in a little bit of trouble. In fact...

07:26.070 --> 07:28.698
you and him are so close
to goin' to jail right now.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.741
It's fuckin' unreal.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.452
And I know that...

07:32.535 --> 07:35.079
'cause of different things I know
and I've read.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.247
Why did you do this?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.460
[chuckles] Well, um...

07:42.170 --> 07:46.716
Uh, I guess the reason
we did anything was to, um...

07:46.799 --> 07:49.427
I guess set ourselves up
so that we could...

07:49.510 --> 07:54.599
I guess become richer and more prosperous
and more successful and...

07:54.682 --> 07:56.142
[Al] Hey, don't be embarrassed about it.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.561
[clears throat]
Everything I do is for money.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.980
[man]  This particular Mr. Big operation

08:01.063 --> 08:03.900
was the youngest boys ever manipulated.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.570
No one really considered the fact
that these were 19-year-old boys

08:07.653 --> 08:13.743
going before extraordinarily
manipulative federal agents of Canada,

08:13.826 --> 08:15.912
the very best that they have.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.456
[Al] Who chose the bat?

08:18.539 --> 08:21.292
-I can't remember.
-We mutually did, I assume.

08:21.375 --> 08:25.213
Most of this was mutual, I assume.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.509
[Al] Why wouldn't you get a fuckin' .22?
Pop, pop, pop.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.843
We don't know where to get firearms.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.639
Tell us where to buy it back then,
and, you know, silencer and all this crap.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.933
And I'll tell you something else, okay?
One thing we didn't know--

08:37.016 --> 08:39.227
Gunshot residue test,
like, immediately after.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.603
-It was brutal.
-Yeah.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.439
I guess you may have known about that,
but, at the time, I--

08:43.523 --> 08:46.567
I was fuckin' introduced to that concept
when they did the test on us.

08:46.651 --> 08:51.531
They stashed the weapon, the Walkman
that Atif claims to have noticed

08:51.614 --> 08:55.618
that was missing in-between
observing his murdered parents,

08:55.701 --> 08:59.705
and the VCR that they yanked out of the--
out of the holder that it was in.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.291
They put them in a series
of different dumpsters in Seattle.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.087
So, the baseball bat
was never recovered.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.340
Uh, and... there was no way
it was ever going to be recovered.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.843
And-And-And, again,
that's an example of the planning

09:12.927 --> 09:15.137
that went into the way these murders
were committed.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.058
[Al] Jimmy's another guy.
What does Jimmy know about this?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.643
What happened to you in the States.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.231
-Tell me.
-Um, he knows...

09:26.607 --> 09:27.984
what happened.

09:28.067 --> 09:32.321
And then the last scenario was them
bringing Jimmy Miyoshi over to talk to Al.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.491
And Miyoshi, he was the only one
who was smart enough

09:35.575 --> 09:39.161
to not make any concessions
about having been involved in this plan.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.709
[Al]  What I like about you so far
is that, uh...

09:44.792 --> 09:48.212
when they were going down to the States,
you didn't fuckin' rat 'em out.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.299
-[Miyoshi]  There's nothing to rat about.
-[Al]  What? You could've ratted 'em out.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.842
-[Miyoshi]  Huh?
-[Al]  You could've ratted them out.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.469
[Miyoshi]  I'm just saying
that there's nothing to rat about.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.556
Do I believe that he was in
on some of the planning? I do.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.435
Jimmy Miyoshi
was the last piece to the puzzle.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.688
[Burns]  He basically just wants to know,
like-- confirm with you, I guess,

10:05.771 --> 10:08.274
did you know, like, what...

10:08.357 --> 10:11.402
you know, was going to go on
in the States kind of thing?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.154
[Miyoshi]  Why don't you talk for me, then?

10:13.904 --> 10:15.656
[Al]  This isn't gonna work.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.493
[Burns]  Jimmy, I know
that I can trust you with my life.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.370
You know what I mean?
He doesn't know that, all right?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.789
And so, if you explain,
"Yes, I knew about it in advance.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.958
I didn't say shit to anybody," okay,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.210
It just shows that, basically, you know,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.379
you... didn't fuck me up.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.174
[Al]  Did you know about it?

10:34.091 --> 10:36.093
-Huh?
-[Miyoshi]  Do you want me to speak loud--

10:36.177 --> 10:37.553
[Al]  No, I don't want you to speak loud.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.680
You're sitting there like you're
a little fucking whipped puppy dog.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.057
Do you know who killed the parents?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.642
-[Miyoshi]  Yeah.
-[Al]  Who?

10:45.102 --> 10:46.687
-[Miyoshi]  Is that all you want?
-[Al]  Yeah.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.689
[Miyoshi]  And... I just want...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.817
I just want you to explain to me exactly
the purposes of you wanting to know.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.487
Is that so we can establish
this kind of...?

10:54.570 --> 10:55.780
[Al]  Totally for trust.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.156
-[Miyoshi]  Totally for trust?
-[Al]  Totally.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.449
[Miyoshi]  Okay.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.618
-Yes, I do know.
-[Al]  Okay, who did it?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.036
[Miyoshi]  Right there.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.412
[Al]  Yeah, Sebastian.
I knew that all along,

11:03.496 --> 11:05.665
so you're not fucking telling me
somethin' I don't know.

11:06.957 --> 11:11.003
And, as we like to say,
that was the beginning of the end.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.132
[woman]  Tonight, police charged
the two 19-year-olds

11:15.216 --> 11:16.967
with three counts of aggravated murder...

11:17.051 --> 11:18.594
[man]  ...murdering his father, mother,
and sister.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.764
[woman]  They say they have
a wire-tapped confession from the pair...

11:21.847 --> 11:22.932
[man]  Once they had the confession,

11:23.015 --> 11:26.519
the Canadians made an arrest
on Burns and Rafay

11:26.602 --> 11:28.396
for the conspiracy to commit the murder.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.815
[woman] Got anything to say Sebastian?

11:30.898 --> 11:33.317
[man]  And that confession
was now probable cause,

11:33.401 --> 11:35.986
based on the physical evidence
that we had in Bellevue

11:36.070 --> 11:40.783
to get warrants for their arrest
for murder in the state of Washington.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.620
[woman]  Sebastian Burns and Atif Rafay
will likely be held in custody

11:44.703 --> 11:49.125
for some time while officials
in both countries work out legal details.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.588
[Konat]  I had to make arguments
in Canadian courts

11:54.672 --> 11:57.800
about why Burns and Rafay
should be extradited to the United States.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.803
They spent more than six years
fighting that extradition.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.557
But, ultimately,
the extradition was accomplished,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.892
and they were back
in the state of Washington

12:06.976 --> 12:08.686
so that they could be brought to trial.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.784
[man]  Rafay, after years,

12:23.868 --> 12:28.581
was offered a "sweetheart" soft time
in a Canadian prison

12:28.664 --> 12:30.708
for turning on Sebastian.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.585
As he told me--

12:32.668 --> 12:35.004
because I wanted to make sure
I heard it from him, and I did--

12:35.087 --> 12:38.132
he said, "I couldn't do that.
It just isn't the truth."

12:39.467 --> 12:40.509
And he never did.

12:41.594 --> 12:46.515
Jimmy Miyoshi was immediately threatened
with being a co-conspirator

12:46.599 --> 12:50.227
unless he went along
with the sweetheart deal

12:50.311 --> 12:51.937
and fingered both of them.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.914
[Konat]  We spent
about four and a half months

13:09.997 --> 13:11.165
putting testimony on

13:11.248 --> 13:13.918
so that all of the defense lawyers
could understand

13:14.001 --> 13:16.003
how this undercover operation works.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.964
And once they did, they were
in a position to argue to the judge

13:19.048 --> 13:20.174
that it should not be admissible.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.970
[Saunders]  When you go to trial,
the only evidence that can come in

13:25.054 --> 13:27.223
are things that's lawfully gained.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.642
And you can't force someone
to say something

13:29.725 --> 13:31.352
that they wouldn't have said otherwise.

13:31.435 --> 13:35.940
That kind of confession should not come in
because it's not freely given.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.943
[woman]  Defense attorneys
wanted the tapes thrown out,

13:39.026 --> 13:42.655
saying Canadian police
used methods illegal in the U.S.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.866
But because investigators
followed Canadian law,

13:45.950 --> 13:49.578
the judge said he'll allow it
under international treaty.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.247
That motion is denied.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.833
[woman]  It is a major victory
for prosecutors.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.837
There's all kinds of hypotheticals
and "what ifs," but that--

13:58.921 --> 14:01.882
that was a very, very key issue
in this case.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.136
And, obviously,
it was devastating to the two accused

14:06.220 --> 14:09.265
that that confession
was going to be used against them.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.105
[Dave]  Sebastian was
at first represented by Neil Fox.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.607
And Theresa Olson.

14:20.276 --> 14:24.154
They were really hard working,
hard digging defense lawyers.

14:25.906 --> 14:30.160
Theresa Olson went to see
Jimmy Miyoshi in Tokyo

14:30.244 --> 14:34.290
and came away convinced
that Jimmy knew that he'd been leaned on

14:34.373 --> 14:39.461
and that he'd like to come back
and, uh... withdraw his evidence.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.257
Having flown back to Seattle
by 7:30 in the morning,

14:43.340 --> 14:44.717
she was in to see Sebastian...

14:45.926 --> 14:47.636
to tell him what she had, uh...

14:47.720 --> 14:51.015
picked up from Jimmy
and how this was going to, uh...

14:51.098 --> 14:53.142
really turn this case around.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.896
And then...
the whole other fiasco occurred.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.286
Theresa Olson was observed by no fewer
than three corrections officers

15:12.369 --> 15:15.581
in the King County Jail
having sex with Burns.

15:15.664 --> 15:16.832
I-I didn't see it,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.960
but I did read the statements
of the three officers who did see it,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.128
and it was for real.

15:21.712 --> 15:25.382
[man]  The sex scandal at the county jail
could delay the trial again.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.676
[woman]  Olson's lapse in judgment
cost the case time,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.178
and it cost the county money.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.097
[man] How much money
may have to be re-spent?

15:32.181 --> 15:34.016
Uh, a lot. I don't have any way of--

15:34.099 --> 15:38.145
There's no way for me to give you
an estimate of what we, as tax payers,

15:38.228 --> 15:42.691
paid for the representation of Ms. Olson
and Mr. Fox for the last 34 months.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.111
[Klonsky]  Of course,
Sebastian gets blamed for this.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.906
That was a horrifically
stupid thing to do.

15:49.490 --> 15:53.118
But here's a young man
who's been in prison for years.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.162
And nobody's resisting.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.499
I think it's just part
of the strangeness of this case.

15:58.582 --> 16:04.838
The focus has to be whether Mr. Burns
and Mr. Rafay can have a fair trial.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.132
Um, they deserve to have a fair trial.

16:07.216 --> 16:12.346
The allegations involving Ms. Olson
constitute a distraction to that.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.183
[Dave]  And so, Fox and Olson
were taken off the case.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.228
Theresa vanished almost immediately.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.898
Less than 24 hours after Theresa
gets on a plane coming back,

16:22.982 --> 16:28.570
all excited about what she's been able
to extricate from Jimmy Miyoshi...

16:28.654 --> 16:29.655
That's gone.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.826
So, the case got delayed
for another 18 months, two years.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.999
While new lawyers Jeff Robinson
and Sam Richardson came in.

16:40.082 --> 16:45.713
When police officers pretend
to be mobsters, when they lie, threaten,

16:45.796 --> 16:49.133
and intimidate teenagers
into manipulating them

16:49.216 --> 16:51.552
into a make-believe world
of organized crime,

16:52.302 --> 16:55.639
that creates the recipe
for a false confession.

17:00.352 --> 17:05.274
During all of those years,
we did not know the evidence

17:05.357 --> 17:07.484
that had been gathered...

17:07.568 --> 17:08.485
against them.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.695
I learned...

17:10.821 --> 17:12.489
what the evidence really was...

17:14.033 --> 17:16.118
I'm gonna say 2002.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.872
Jeff Robinson said there's nothing
but the confessions.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.166
And I thought, "Oh, well.

17:24.043 --> 17:24.877
Thank God."

17:25.586 --> 17:27.963
Because these confessions are nonsense.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.266
According to the story
that Atif and Sebastian made up,

17:39.349 --> 17:43.187
Sebastian went around the house,
clubbed everybody to death,

17:43.270 --> 17:46.398
while Atif sat down in the living room
and did nothing.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.567
[Al]  Where was he when all this was
goin' on? That's what I wanna know.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.446
He's, like... around the corner.
He didn't physically see it.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.407
Um, and, like, the same thing
with his sister.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.410
One of the problems with that theory,

17:58.494 --> 18:02.831
uh, was that there was blood spatter
in Mr. Rafay's bedroom.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.752
And the wall showed the outline of a body,

18:07.336 --> 18:11.799
which showed, in all likelihood,
that someone was standing there,

18:11.882 --> 18:14.551
along with the person
who was killing Mr. Rafay.

18:15.511 --> 18:20.349
So, the story that Atif was sitting down
somewhere in the living room

18:20.432 --> 18:23.852
and Sebastian was going around
killing everybody,

18:23.936 --> 18:25.437
it wouldn't have held up.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.859
[woman]  There are all kinds
of internal inconsistencies and...

18:30.943 --> 18:32.528
you know, things that just
don't make sense

18:32.611 --> 18:34.613
and don't match
with the physical evidence.

18:36.698 --> 18:41.161
They were asleep upstairs,
the dad and the sister.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.043
The sister who, basically, um...

18:49.628 --> 18:53.382
yeah, was standing up
and walking around or whatever, so...

18:53.465 --> 18:55.050
This is a key marker
of a false confession.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.678
[Al] Where'd you guys
get the baseball bat from?

18:57.761 --> 19:00.347
I think it was, like,
just kickin' around or something, like...

19:00.430 --> 19:02.015
[Al] You didn't go buy it
in a store down there

19:02.099 --> 19:03.976
where they can trace it back to you guys?

19:04.059 --> 19:05.102
No?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.526
-[Al] Who bought the bat?
-It was bought in Bellingham.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.362
-[Al] You were both...
-We were both in the store.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.864
[Isaacs]  It changes over time.

19:16.947 --> 19:21.827
It changes from Sebastian to Atif.
It's a... It's a childish story.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.454
[Al] Hopefully, they don't empty
the dumpster on Tuesday morning.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.081
That's all I'm thinking of.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.876
And yours and your friend's clothes
are both in there?

19:28.959 --> 19:31.086
In dumpsters.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.421
In different dumpsters all over?

19:33.755 --> 19:35.591
Not-- Not like--
Yours and his aren't together?

19:36.592 --> 19:37.968
Each article was in a different one.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.434
-[Al] And what'd you do with your clothes?
-Uh...

19:45.767 --> 19:47.144
Hucked out the window, I think.

19:47.227 --> 19:50.981
Those-- Those ones I did.
Or-Or, at least, the socks and...

19:52.482 --> 19:54.234
We had gloves.
They got hucked out the window.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.947
[Al] Why do you say all the clothes
went in the dumpster,

19:59.031 --> 20:00.657
he says they're out the window?

20:00.741 --> 20:03.160
I'm assuming that "out the window"
is the most colloquial term

20:03.243 --> 20:05.454
for saying, "I tossed the crap out."

20:07.998 --> 20:11.627
As an undercover agent,
what would I say to Rafay and Burns?

20:11.710 --> 20:14.630
I'm trying to understand.
I'm trying to believe their confession.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.506
"Tell me how the murder
of your mother went down.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.343
This is really important.
Tell me how it went down."

20:19.426 --> 20:20.510
They didn't do that.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.180
Now, we cut back to Sultana's photo.

20:24.181 --> 20:30.062
She was obviously murdered
with the shawl over her head facing east.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.857
I mean, if you ever want
a red flashing light that said,

20:33.941 --> 20:38.487
"This is an Islamic fundamentalist
based murder," that's it.

20:39.446 --> 20:44.284
It was well into the 2000s
before I realized

20:44.368 --> 20:45.661
there's no DNA evidence.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.538
There's no fingerprints. No weapons.

20:48.622 --> 20:52.542
I don't really think I found out
about the Mr. Big situation

20:52.626 --> 20:55.671
until... the trial.

21:11.728 --> 21:16.024
[woman]  Atif Rafay and Sebastian Burns
are now 27 years old

21:16.108 --> 21:19.945
and just about to stand trial
for a triple murder that happened

21:20.028 --> 21:21.571
when they were teenagers.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.574
The two friends are accused
of beating Rafay's parents

21:24.658 --> 21:28.453
and autistic sister to death,
nine years ago in Bellevue.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.417
I thought "Yippee,
I'm getting out of work for a while."

21:34.167 --> 21:36.169
'Cause I work on my knees at Boeing.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.338
"Wow, I'll get a break for a while."

21:42.676 --> 21:45.595
It was the biggest thing
that happened in Bellevue

21:45.679 --> 21:47.597
and probably still is, you know?

21:47.681 --> 21:51.727
[Konat]  Mr. Burns and Mr. Rafay
acted in tandem to extinguish,

21:51.810 --> 21:57.190
to systematically wipe out, if you will,
the Rafay family in July of 1994.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.400
Their disenchantment...

21:58.483 --> 22:01.236
[woman]  James Konat was a snappy dresser.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.489
[laughs]

22:04.573 --> 22:05.866
He always looked so nice.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.369
Yeah. The women on the trial loved it.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.876
I wouldn't say
that the RCMP made my mind up,

22:15.959 --> 22:19.463
because my mind was pretty much
already made up even before I saw that.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.841
But I liked Mr. Big. [laughs]

22:24.051 --> 22:25.343
That was quite interesting.

22:26.470 --> 22:30.557
Part of the reason why they get
these targets involved in criminality

22:30.640 --> 22:34.603
is to devalue them in front of a jury.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.230
They want to make this person
look like someone

22:37.314 --> 22:41.193
who's not worthy of reasonable doubt
in a fair trial.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.695
[man] Do you want a stout?

22:44.780 --> 22:46.448
-Sebastian.
-No, thanks.

22:46.531 --> 22:50.160
[Isaacs]  The earlier tapes
don't look good for the RCMP.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.497
They're menacing and threatening
and bullying.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.248
And, um... that comes through.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.836
Did I tell ya' that fucker said, uh...
he needed the money...

22:59.920 --> 23:01.630
for something
and had a real fuckin' attitude?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.341
I told him, uh...

23:07.094 --> 23:09.471
Next time... it happened...

23:10.889 --> 23:13.266
I'd chop his fuckin'
old lady's hands off.

23:15.393 --> 23:16.353
And fuckin', uh...

23:17.270 --> 23:19.231
till he paid,
she'd fuckin' sit there and bleed.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.402
This guy with his ponytail
and his greasy look and, uh...

23:24.486 --> 23:26.071
"So, what the fuck
are you telling me? Fuck!

23:26.154 --> 23:28.740
I didn't come on
last night's fucking train, fuckhead!"

23:28.824 --> 23:31.952
They talked like that
to be threatening and intimidating

23:32.035 --> 23:33.995
and, uh, to add to their image.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.790
All these guys had been trained
in somebody's theater school.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.918
[Al]  How do you fucking,
uh, hit someone with a baseball bat,

23:40.001 --> 23:41.628
have to shower,
and have no blood on you?

23:42.629 --> 23:43.880
[Sebastian]  You do it naked.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.092
Once they saw the tapes,
the jury was shocked.

23:47.968 --> 23:52.264
When someone confesses to murdering
three people, that pretty much...

23:52.347 --> 23:56.434
I mean, that really solidified
the whole case, as far as I was concerned.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.395
You know, I was open-minded at first,

23:58.478 --> 24:01.439
but the one kid from Canada
had bragged about it.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.358
[Al]  Both you guys woke up one day
and said, "Hey,

24:03.441 --> 24:06.778
let's go off your family
and fuckin' get all their money?"

24:07.863 --> 24:09.114
[Sebastian]  Basically.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.617
It was quite disgusting, actually.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.536
I was disgusted at Sebastian

24:14.619 --> 24:17.247
for being so flippant
about the whole thing.

24:19.374 --> 24:23.712
Even if the content of the confession
is demonstrated to be false,

24:23.795 --> 24:26.173
juries think, "I would never do that.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.216
I would never make
incriminating statements,

24:28.300 --> 24:30.302
false statements about myself.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.220
Only a guilty person would do that."

24:32.804 --> 24:36.600
And that's part of the negative power
of confessions evidence.

24:39.769 --> 24:45.108
The original defense attorneys wanted me
to testify as to criminal braggadocio.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.235
Now, enter new attorneys.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.280
They said, "Well, we're going
with the fear defense."

24:51.615 --> 24:56.286
And, since they claimed
that they were frightened into confession,

24:56.369 --> 24:59.581
then everything I wrote,
my whole review, was moot.

24:59.664 --> 25:03.168
It was the judge that said,
"We don't need Levine's testimony."

25:03.251 --> 25:08.173
Because you don't need an expert
to tell you that somebody's afraid or not

25:08.256 --> 25:09.466
when it's on video.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.550
And I was out.

25:11.593 --> 25:16.514
The judge prohibited the defense
from raising all kinds of defenses

25:16.598 --> 25:17.807
that, uh...

25:17.891 --> 25:19.601
they should have been able to say.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.896
"It could've been these people.
It could've been that person."

25:22.979 --> 25:25.232
But none of it was allowed in
by the judge.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.651
So, we really had a situation where

25:27.734 --> 25:29.903
what the jury heard
was the state's evidence.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.865
[Isaacs]  They just had these statements,
and they chose to believe them.

25:33.949 --> 25:40.247
And they chose to not believe
all of the other substantial hard evidence

25:40.330 --> 25:41.456
that had been supplied.

25:41.539 --> 25:43.541
[man]  The defense attorney says
police ignored

25:43.625 --> 25:45.377
a fingerprint on this shower door.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.005
And they ignored a blood spot
in the shower with DNA

25:49.089 --> 25:51.549
from Tariq Rafay and someone else,

25:51.633 --> 25:55.762
someone else who didn't match
any of the victims or Burns or Rafay.

25:56.346 --> 26:02.852
Whose DNA got mixed
with Dr. Rafay's blood in the shower?

26:02.936 --> 26:05.438
Doesn't it have to be the killer?

26:05.522 --> 26:09.359
[man]  Robinson says police found
an unknown fingerprint on this door,

26:09.442 --> 26:11.361
another blood spot in the garage.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.656
Again, blood from Tariq Rafay
mixed with blood

26:14.739 --> 26:17.117
from a different, unidentified person.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.121
[Levin]  If they did do it,
that incredibly bloody murder,

26:21.204 --> 26:24.207
why could they not come up
with any forensics

26:24.291 --> 26:26.584
that was undisputably linked
to the murder?

26:26.668 --> 26:28.169
Nothing. Zero.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.671
If they did do it,

26:30.088 --> 26:32.299
how come, in the hundreds,

26:32.382 --> 26:35.510
if not, a thousand hours of audio
that I listened to--

26:35.593 --> 26:37.095
that they didn't know
they were being taped--

26:37.178 --> 26:40.640
it was in their car, in their bedroom--
how come they never even mentioned it?

26:40.724 --> 26:41.599
Sebastian...

26:41.683 --> 26:44.561
[Levin]  The fact that these prosecutors
were willing to put in as evidence

26:44.644 --> 26:48.857
that they're devotees of Nietzsche,
who believes that it's okay

26:48.940 --> 26:50.775
for people to kill each other--

26:50.859 --> 26:54.404
as evidence--
tells you really how bad this is.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.410
[Hutchinson]  They also were
the subjects of some betrayal

27:00.493 --> 27:04.539
by, at least, one of their friends,
Jimmy Miyoshi.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.084
What did Atif tell you

27:08.168 --> 27:11.212
when he discussed what had occurred
at the time of the murders?

27:12.922 --> 27:16.885
I remember him telling me,
after his mother was struck, that...

27:16.968 --> 27:22.390
he went and got the VCR,
while Sebastian had gone in...

27:22.474 --> 27:25.477
into, uh... his father's bedroom.

27:26.728 --> 27:31.649
And when they had left,
that his sister was...

27:32.359 --> 27:34.819
um, I guess, still alive.

27:36.363 --> 27:40.241
[Konat]  Jimmy Miyoshi was one
of the most obstinate and uncooperative,

27:40.325 --> 27:43.495
soft-spoken, polite witnesses
I've ever had.

27:44.537 --> 27:47.832
With the time that you were living
in Ontario, going to school,

27:47.916 --> 27:50.126
and then the time when you moved to Japan,

27:50.210 --> 27:52.670
there was a total of about six years

27:52.754 --> 27:55.715
where nobody contacted you
about this case.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.716
Yes.

27:56.800 --> 28:01.262
[Robinson] And when this case
came back into your life,

28:01.346 --> 28:04.057
it ended up touching your job, didn't it?

28:04.140 --> 28:06.476
Yes, eventually, it did affect my job.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.770
[Konat]  The only reason
he ever came back to testify

28:08.853 --> 28:12.148
was because he was working
for an American corporation in Japan.

28:12.232 --> 28:16.653
And we called them
and told them about his role and our...

28:16.736 --> 28:19.823
our concern about how involved
he might've been in this.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.449
And his employer said to him,

28:21.533 --> 28:23.952
"You need to go
to the United States of America

28:24.035 --> 28:27.497
and cooperate with the authorities and do
what you need to do to make this right."

28:28.123 --> 28:31.584
And that's the only reason
we ever got Jimmy Miyoshi back here.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.878
[Robinson] And it was clear to you

28:33.962 --> 28:37.590
that if you refused
to come here and testify,

28:37.674 --> 28:40.468
your company would find
a reason to fire you

28:40.552 --> 28:43.012
-in the immediate future?
-Yes. That's what I believed, yes.

28:45.181 --> 28:49.936
[Robinson] I'll ask if this is a copy
of an email that you sent to Mr. Konat...

28:50.979 --> 28:52.397
the King County prosecutors.

28:54.524 --> 28:59.237
In the first paragraph, sir,
did you state the following?

28:59.320 --> 29:03.450
"I did not believe you had it
in yourselves to damage careers

29:03.533 --> 29:07.746
that my wife and I have worked
considerably hard to rebuild

29:07.829 --> 29:11.458
from our situation almost ten years ago.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.961
I am not sure
what we have to live for at this point,

29:15.044 --> 29:18.590
and I am not convinced
that we can ever recover from this."

29:18.673 --> 29:20.216
-Did you write that?
-Yes.

29:21.050 --> 29:24.888
[Robinson] July 31st, 1995. I'm going
back to that day you were arrested.

29:24.971 --> 29:28.641
One of the things they were telling you
is that you could go to jail

29:28.725 --> 29:32.228
if you didn't say Sebastian and Atif
told you about the murders.

29:32.312 --> 29:37.108
And Sergeant Rinn
confirmed that for you.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.235
He told you, "Hey, we'll re-open

29:39.319 --> 29:42.530
our conspiracy-to-commit-murder case
against you in Canada

29:42.614 --> 29:47.202
if you don't come and testify, consistent
with your immunity agreement."

29:47.285 --> 29:48.953
That's what he told you, right?

29:49.037 --> 29:50.455
Possibly, yes.

29:50.538 --> 29:55.835
[Robinson] Do you recall saying
that Atif told you his sister was alive

29:55.919 --> 29:58.963
when they left the house
after attacking the family?

29:59.964 --> 30:02.050
-You said that yesterday, didn't you?
-Yes.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.636
[Robinson] It's the first time
in eight years

30:04.719 --> 30:07.972
that you have ever said
anything like that, isn't it, sir?

30:08.056 --> 30:10.683
I-I probably have mentioned
things like that,

30:10.767 --> 30:12.977
but not necessarily in those statements.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.313
[Robinson] You're making it up
as you go along, sir.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.273
That's why you're saying things
for the first time yesterday.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.608
No, I don't believe I am.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.447
[Robinson] You actually called my office
before you came here to testify.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.782
-Didn't you?
-[Miyoshi] Yes, I did.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.660
[Robinson] One of the things you said
during that conversation was,

30:28.743 --> 30:32.831
"Well, Mr. Robinson,
how would the situation change

30:32.914 --> 30:36.626
if I were to be a witness for your side?"

30:36.709 --> 30:37.710
You remember saying that?

30:39.462 --> 30:40.380
Um...

30:43.132 --> 30:43.967
No, I don't.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.638
So, from any evidence
I've ever read about Jimmy Miyoshi,

30:48.721 --> 30:55.228
he largely said what he thought--
what it was they wanted to hear.

30:55.812 --> 30:59.732
[Levin]  I-I absolutely think nothing
of the Jimmy Miyoshi statement.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.777
You can pretty much threaten
somebody with prosecution

31:02.861 --> 31:04.153
and get them to say anything.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.339
[Konat]  They're desperate
for you to believe

31:23.423 --> 31:24.757
that somebody snuck into that house

31:24.841 --> 31:28.386
in a very brief period of time
and systematically executed this family.

31:28.469 --> 31:31.848
How many times
does the evidence have to tell us

31:31.931 --> 31:34.684
it's not Sebastian and it's not Atif.

31:34.767 --> 31:37.353
They are desperate for you to ignore
the way that they behaved

31:37.437 --> 31:38.855
for the 12 months that followed.

31:38.938 --> 31:42.150
We still don't know
who committed these murders.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.526
[Dave]  I was there for the closing.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.945
And when I heard
the closing arguments of both sides,

31:46.029 --> 31:47.906
I thought, "These kids are gonna
be out of here."

31:47.989 --> 31:51.200
I was convinced
that they were gonna be walking free.

31:51.284 --> 31:55.538
She was in her bedroom
while Sebastian Burns and Atif Rafay

31:55.622 --> 31:57.832
were systematically executing her parents.

31:57.916 --> 32:02.086
I thought Konat was rambling,
and he was... he was angry.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.214
And I'm thinking,
"He thinks he's lost this case,

32:05.298 --> 32:07.759
and he's trying to pull out the--
whatever he can."

32:07.842 --> 32:14.641
What this is really all about is,
they're upset that they got caught.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.560
And that was what I took away
from his closing argument.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.811
I was dead wrong.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.360
[man] We, the jury, find the defendant,
Glen Sebastian Burns,

32:25.443 --> 32:29.030
guilty of the crime of murder
in the first degree.

32:29.113 --> 32:33.242
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Atif Ahmad Rafay,

32:33.326 --> 32:36.746
guilty of the crime of murder
in the first degree.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.416
[Hutchinson]  In the end,
despite the tight alibis,

32:41.125 --> 32:44.587
the lack of physical or forensic evidence,

32:44.671 --> 32:45.630
the jury convicted them,

32:45.713 --> 32:47.423
and they convicted them
for one reason only,

32:47.507 --> 32:49.217
and that's because of their confessions.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.136
-[man] Your reaction, Mr. Burns?
-Back off. Back off.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.554
Give us some room. Thank you.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.483
Found guilty on three counts of homicide.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.528
And then we were there for the sentencing.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.657
[man] Uh, Mr. Burns,
I'm obligated at this point to stop

33:12.740 --> 33:16.661
and give you an opportunity
to make a statement before I sentence you.

33:16.744 --> 33:21.165
If there's something you want to say,
I will, uh, certainly consider it.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.084
Mr. Burns.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.377
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:26.045 --> 33:29.090
My friend and I have been convicted
for a crime we did not commit.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.176
There's two things I want to discuss
this morning, if possible.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.723
The first is, a few reasons
why I think our trial is unfair.

33:36.806 --> 33:37.640
With respect.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.269
I was hoping to make
some comments about the evidence.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.564
We were unable to tell this jury...

33:46.274 --> 33:47.525
about other suspects...

33:48.526 --> 33:50.903
who knew what the murder weapon was
before anybody else did.

33:53.072 --> 33:56.826
We were prosecuted with a tactic
that would not be legal in this country.

33:56.909 --> 34:02.915
We were not able to present evidence
to answer the state's case.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.670
I was not allowed to give

34:07.754 --> 34:10.173
critical testimony
that I needed to give...

34:11.174 --> 34:13.051
to explain this evidence.

34:13.134 --> 34:19.640
We were defending ourselves in this trial
with both arms tied behind our backs.

34:22.351 --> 34:26.230
[Konat]  Burns stood up and said
that his two Ivy League educated lawyers

34:26.314 --> 34:28.399
didn't handle his case properly,

34:28.483 --> 34:32.278
that they didn't give him
effective assistance of counsel.

34:32.361 --> 34:33.654
You know, I think most people

34:33.738 --> 34:35.531
who understand
what the word "hubris" means...

34:36.157 --> 34:37.992
they oughta put his picture
in the dictionary.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.369
I'm certainly...

34:41.454 --> 34:44.707
I certainly feel sorry for the victims.
I feel sorry for their surviving son.

34:45.833 --> 34:49.212
I feel sorry for their surviving family.
We didn't commit the crime.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.922
We've been found guilty

34:51.005 --> 34:53.174
based on the continuing
representations of the state...

34:54.801 --> 34:56.344
and the news media.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.261
It seems that...

34:58.554 --> 35:01.140
the principal other piece of evidence
against us is...

35:01.224 --> 35:02.683
is arrogance.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.310
Our arrogant personalities.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.649
When the newspaper stories
first started to appear about us

35:09.732 --> 35:12.276
when I was 18, back in 1994...

35:13.152 --> 35:16.114
my stomach would go into knots
whenever a story would come out.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.783
I would be inconsolable
for the rest of the day.

35:18.866 --> 35:22.870
The way that I got over that
was to become cynical and to act tough.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.124
And it's the same way I got over
not being able to go to school.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.583
Or work.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.751
Or have a public life.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.297
[woman coughs]

35:35.550 --> 35:38.136
Atif and I have been convicted
for a crime we didn't commit.

35:39.512 --> 35:42.515
We're going to be sentenced
for a crime we didn't commit.

35:42.598 --> 35:46.936
Unless somebody does something to stop it.
Your Honor, that's all I have to say.

35:48.312 --> 35:52.066
[Dave]  Sebastian's statements
actually were quite articulate,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.777
but for people who were just there
for the show

35:54.861 --> 35:59.907
and hadn't followed the case,
it was written as a deranged rambling.

35:59.991 --> 36:04.537
But it wasn't that way at all.
It was the, uh, thoughts expressed,

36:04.620 --> 36:07.832
perhaps not as punchy
as they could have been,

36:07.915 --> 36:13.379
but when you've spent seven or eight years
in various forms of incarceration...

36:14.505 --> 36:15.423
uh...

36:16.382 --> 36:18.676
you...

36:18.759 --> 36:22.847
you didn't perhaps have
the, uh, best critical audience.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.683
[Mertel] Mr. Burns, you're, uh...

36:26.684 --> 36:28.269
you've been, uh...

36:29.687 --> 36:33.441
uh, given ample opportunity
to make your allocution.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.358
Uh...

36:36.694 --> 36:40.156
It's-It's-- It's chilling,
uh, your recitation...

36:40.740 --> 36:45.828
of what you feel has occurred
over these many years.

36:45.912 --> 36:51.542
It's chilling in the lack of remorse
that you show for these victims.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.753
I mean, it was virtually a throwaway line

36:53.836 --> 36:57.882
that I suspect your attorney
suggested to you after the break.

36:57.965 --> 37:00.551
-[Sebastian] That's not true.
-But, in any event, it--

37:00.635 --> 37:03.346
You got to talk, Mr. Burns.
Now, I get to talk.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.597
Okay?

37:04.680 --> 37:10.061
You're not immoral. You're amoral.
You have no moral rudder, whatsoever.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.106
You are an arrogant convicted killer.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.944
You are not a kid,
as you so often refer to yourself.

37:18.527 --> 37:22.657
You're an adult, and you will
be held responsible as an adult.

37:23.866 --> 37:28.871
You were convicted, Mr. Burns,
based on your own chilling,

37:28.955 --> 37:30.873
casual confession.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.835
It is, therefore,
the conclusion of this court

37:34.919 --> 37:39.006
that you should be sentenced
on count one, on count two,

37:39.590 --> 37:40.800
and on count three,

37:40.883 --> 37:44.136
to life without possibility of parole.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.644
Those three sentences
to run consecutively.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.734
Shall we proceed with Mr. Rafay?

38:00.069 --> 38:02.613
I wanna thank you, Your Honor,
for the opportunity in speaking.

38:03.406 --> 38:07.326
[sighs] Today is a day of anguish for me.
It's not the first.

38:08.786 --> 38:14.625
I... want to insist today on the truth...
that we are innocent.

38:14.709 --> 38:18.379
[voice breaking] And I loved my parents.
I revere their memory to this day.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.134
I can't convey to you the mortification

38:23.217 --> 38:27.430
that I felt over the course of this trial,

38:27.513 --> 38:30.933
the lie that we told,
the masks that we put on.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.561
The masks that we put on...

38:35.104 --> 38:37.440
to survive a situation,

38:37.523 --> 38:41.861
an appalling, atrocious situation
that was constructed...

38:41.944 --> 38:47.616
constructed to entice us and elicit
from us those very lies and that mask.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.537
I'm tormented by the thought

38:51.620 --> 38:57.501
that I've been manipulated somehow
into contributing to the fact

38:57.585 --> 39:00.880
that my parents' killers, to this day,
walk with impunity,

39:00.963 --> 39:04.425
that their murders have never
been properly investigated.

39:05.509 --> 39:10.181
The loss of my parents devastated me,
left me utterly bereft.

39:10.264 --> 39:14.602
I didn't know how to construct--
re-construct my life

39:14.685 --> 39:17.438
in the month--
weeks and months that followed.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.608
When I say I loved my parents,

39:20.691 --> 39:21.567
I don't mean...

39:22.735 --> 39:25.738
that I felt merely the feeling
of affection that every child,

39:25.821 --> 39:27.281
I'm sure, feels for their parents.

39:28.115 --> 39:32.620
I mean that I truly admired my father.
His brilliance, his learning...

39:33.746 --> 39:34.872
his...

39:35.456 --> 39:38.584
sincere pleasure
in every opportunity at generosity.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.422
I was probably closer to my mother
than to any other person

39:43.506 --> 39:44.590
than I ever will be.

39:46.342 --> 39:52.223
And the memory of her wit and her charm
and her keen human sympathy...

39:54.058 --> 39:56.018
are dear to me to this day.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.272
And-And they'll be vivid
to everyone who knew her,

40:01.023 --> 40:02.316
including some of my friends.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.362
I consider having my family
the greatest of privileges.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.865
They're with me in my memory today.

40:13.327 --> 40:16.372
I'm gonna continue to struggle
for the truth in this case,

40:16.455 --> 40:17.957
of our innocence.

40:18.040 --> 40:18.874
Because...

40:19.959 --> 40:23.087
I won't betray their hopes for me

40:24.213 --> 40:27.049
or their expectations of me,

40:27.133 --> 40:28.843
which I'm proud to say that they had.

40:30.094 --> 40:33.681
-I'd like to thank this court.
-[Mertel] Mr. Rafay, thank you.

40:33.764 --> 40:38.561
Unlike your colleague, I find you
genuinely remorseful, Mr. Rafay.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.104
Uh...

40:41.856 --> 40:44.191
I think you do have a moral compass. Uh...

40:46.193 --> 40:48.904
Your conviction was-- and I...

40:48.988 --> 40:52.032
I can't explain it either,
why you would do that if it wasn't true.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.161
The difficulty is telling somebody
you were lying then,

40:55.244 --> 40:57.079
but you're telling the truth now.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.914
Always a difficult proposition.

40:59.498 --> 41:02.001
But you were convicted
on your own confessions.

41:02.084 --> 41:06.380
Frightening confessions
casually given about...

41:06.464 --> 41:08.257
how you did these things
and why you did it.

41:08.340 --> 41:11.427
In fact, I think one of your remarks was,
"This was unfortunate,

41:11.510 --> 41:14.388
but it simply had to be done
to get what we wanted in life."

41:15.806 --> 41:18.851
It's the responsibility of this court
to sentence you,

41:18.934 --> 41:20.936
and I will do that at this time.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.856
On count one,
it's life without possibility of parole.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.610
On count two,
it's life without possibility of parole.

41:27.693 --> 41:31.071
And on count three,
it's life without possibility of parole.

41:31.155 --> 41:34.283
And those three sentences
are to run consecutively.

41:41.373 --> 41:44.668
[Hutchinson]  So many people can't believe
that the Mr. Big technique

41:44.752 --> 41:46.462
is allowed to happen in Canada,

41:46.545 --> 41:51.550
that police officers are allowed
to conduct themselves this way.

41:53.010 --> 41:56.388
And the Canadian Supreme Court has,
in the last year or so,

41:56.472 --> 41:58.724
thrown out a Mr. Big conviction.

41:58.807 --> 42:03.479
The Canadian Supreme Court finally said,
"From now on, you can't do it.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.773
It's presumed inadmissible in trial."

42:05.856 --> 42:09.235
But this was years after Sebastian
had already been convicted.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.452
[Dave]  We see him once a month, and...

42:19.537 --> 42:22.164
uh, it's reasonably pleasant.

42:22.915 --> 42:26.126
We can see him
for about four or five hours at a time.

42:27.127 --> 42:30.005
He spent about ten years
in solitary confinement.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.800
And solitary confinement
is a real brain scrambler.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.845
We saw many changes occurring to him.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.058
You deal with it.

42:41.725 --> 42:42.768
Sometimes, you sleep.

42:42.851 --> 42:47.648
Sometimes, you can't get it out
of your mind and you go over it.

42:47.731 --> 42:50.442
"If I had done this, if I had said that."

42:51.110 --> 42:51.986
Uh...

42:55.072 --> 42:56.031
Wow.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.290
In prison, there's an initial shock,

43:04.373 --> 43:09.295
and then there's... there's
this frightening sense of unreality.

43:11.422 --> 43:15.509
When that begins to fade away
and you enter into a routine,

43:15.593 --> 43:19.388
your previous life begins to seem
like a-- some sort of a dream.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.265
I think that's very frightening.

43:21.348 --> 43:24.476
And especially the idea
that it is gonna continue

43:24.560 --> 43:26.103
and continue and continue like that.

43:30.983 --> 43:34.403
After having recently been married,
I've had a lot of...

43:35.195 --> 43:37.865
I guess, opportunity to think about,

43:37.948 --> 43:39.908
you know, where my dad was
when he was my age...

43:41.285 --> 43:42.369
and where I am now.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.583
Loretta really changed my life
in the sense

43:47.666 --> 43:49.752
that there's now something every day

43:49.835 --> 43:52.588
that I look forward to doing,
which is talking to her.

43:52.671 --> 43:55.299
And gives a whole different shape
to my week

43:55.382 --> 43:59.386
because I'm always looking forward
to seeing her on the weekends.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.348
We always are able to share things,
like reading Shakespeare together

44:02.431 --> 44:03.891
in the visiting room

44:03.974 --> 44:06.560
or working on some issue together.

44:08.020 --> 44:11.273
It changes the whole way
in which I think about time

44:11.357 --> 44:13.233
and think about what I'm doing.

44:14.818 --> 44:18.781
It's a very strange thing
to fall in love and--

44:18.864 --> 44:23.243
and have this beautiful experience
happen in prison

44:23.327 --> 44:25.037
while you're going through
something like this.

44:25.871 --> 44:26.872
[rain falling]

44:30.042 --> 44:32.544
I had been used to my parents
taking care of me

44:32.628 --> 44:36.674
and taking care of things
in the responsible adult world.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.133
I thought that...

44:38.217 --> 44:41.345
that this was one of those things
that would just be taken care of.

44:42.888 --> 44:45.140
I should have been an adult about it.

44:46.183 --> 44:49.687
Justice will not happen
just because you're innocent.
