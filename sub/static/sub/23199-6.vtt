04:18.161 --> 04:20.248
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

04:22.375 --> 04:25.504
Joe. I really mean it. How are you?

04:26.422 --> 04:29.300
Well, I could use a little more shut-eye.

04:29.383 --> 04:32.553
I guess I have the single-parent syndrome.
Where's Steve?

04:32.636 --> 04:35.472
- He's coming.
- Yeah.

04:35.556 --> 04:37.017
Hi, Steve.

05:04.463 --> 05:06.465
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning, sir.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.967
I'm in a little over my head here.

05:09.217 --> 05:11.012
Take a look at this.

05:18.853 --> 05:21.564
That's Hamlin Rule.
He calls himself "The Pied Piper. "

05:21.648 --> 05:23.275
I just bought his last album.

05:23.359 --> 05:25.778
As they say in the trade,
it went gold in a week.

05:25.861 --> 05:29.907
It was 20 with a bullet on Monday,
and by Friday it sold a million copies.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.951
He appeared here in Washington
last night.

05:32.034 --> 05:35.789
That's right. The kids camped out
all night long waiting for tickets.

05:40.210 --> 05:44.839
During the course of that concert,
the entire box office receipts were-

05:45.006 --> 05:46.384
Ripped off?

05:46.467 --> 05:50.429
Exactly, Diana. $172,000.

05:50.554 --> 05:52.807
What's this got to do with the I.A.D.C., sir?

05:52.890 --> 05:55.559
The D.C. Police Commissioner
contacted us.

05:55.643 --> 05:58.480
The safe's lock was actually cut
from the steel door...

05:58.563 --> 06:00.691
With a device or force totally unknown.

06:00.774 --> 06:03.402
It could be devastating
in the hands of our enemies.

06:03.485 --> 06:05.153
There was nothing in the papers.

06:05.237 --> 06:06.571
On my orders.

06:06.655 --> 06:08.824
The safe was opened Without detonation...

06:08.907 --> 06:12.245
yet the entire lock mechanism
was reduced to a pile of steel dust.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.413
No witnesses.

06:13.496 --> 06:16.541
The concert manager was there,
but doesn't remember a thing.

06:16.624 --> 06:19.585
I want the I.A.D.C. to get
to the bottom of this at once.

06:19.669 --> 06:23.424
This isn't the first time that a
Hamlin Rule concert has been ripped off.

06:23.507 --> 06:25.718
Philadelphia last month,
Boston before that.

06:25.801 --> 06:27.094
We'll get right on it, sir.

06:27.177 --> 06:30.347
- I'd appreciate it. Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

06:31.807 --> 06:34.728
I think that Hamlin Rule
is appearing next in Los Angeles.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.855
We better get reservations for the Coast.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.900
Robbery or no robbery, Hoffman,
come up with the bread.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.280
Hamlin Rule did his thing.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.032
Now you do yours.

06:46.115 --> 06:49.076
I fully intend to honor our agreement,
Mr. Schwartz.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.872
If you could give me till the end
of the week, I would be most grateful.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.874
We're leaving for LA Friday night.

06:54.957 --> 06:59.296
Mr. Rule lives out there,
and we'd like the bucks before we split.

06:59.588 --> 07:03.884
I assure you, Mr. Rule will receive
all the monies due him.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.427
In cash, you dig?

07:05.510 --> 07:09.766
If I have to play handball
with a bouncing check, I'll bounce you.

07:11.392 --> 07:15.980
Mr. Schwartz, I have managed
this chain of theaters for a long time...

07:16.356 --> 07:18.941
and nobody has questioned my checks.

07:20.819 --> 07:24.907
That's what they all say
just before they lay a stiff on you.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.203
It's simple. No cash, no concert.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.374
- Come in.
- You busy?

07:32.540 --> 07:36.002
Joe, I was hoping it was you.
How about a cup of coffee?

07:36.086 --> 07:38.546
I'm about to turn into a cup of coffee.

07:38.630 --> 07:43.552
Diana, you are looking at an unhappy
victim of the generation gap.

07:44.136 --> 07:46.847
- Your daughter, Elena.
- Nineteen.

07:47.473 --> 07:50.267
I think that it's not so much
a generation gap...

07:50.351 --> 07:52.061
as it is a geographical gap.

07:52.144 --> 07:54.856
- She's still at UCLA, isn't she?
- I hope so.

07:54.940 --> 07:58.193
I guess so. She called me
and asked for a round-trip ticket.

07:58.276 --> 08:01.029
I sent it,
looking forward to a chance to visit.

08:01.154 --> 08:02.280
She was here yesterday.

08:02.364 --> 08:05.283
Oh, no. I promised to take her
shopping when she came home.

08:05.367 --> 08:08.413
I said she was here,
but you can hardly call it coming home.

08:08.496 --> 08:10.331
- You didn't see her?
- I saw her.

08:10.415 --> 08:14.127
This morning, on the monitor, when we
were watching the Hamlin Rule tape.

08:14.210 --> 08:15.294
You're kidding.

08:15.378 --> 08:18.507
Apparently she went straight from Dulles
and spent the night...

08:18.590 --> 08:20.634
waiting to buy a ticket to see him.

08:20.718 --> 08:22.219
That doesn't sound like Elena.

08:22.303 --> 08:24.596
That's the only time I saw her.

08:24.763 --> 08:27.558
She must have taken the redeye
back to LA this morning.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.226
I'm sorry, Joe.

08:29.644 --> 08:34.357
Diana, she was a 3.6 student
before she fell in with that rock group.

08:35.066 --> 08:38.528
Now there are letters from
the Dean of Girls about failing grades.

08:38.611 --> 08:40.780
She's taken to
not answering my phone calls.

08:40.864 --> 08:44.869
Obviously, the only reason I've heard
from her was because she wanted airfare.

08:44.952 --> 08:46.245
I don't know what to do.

08:46.329 --> 08:49.540
Look. Steve and I were going
to the Coast, right?

08:50.833 --> 08:52.501
Why don't you take his place?

08:52.585 --> 08:55.797
He won't mind watching the store.
That's what friends are for.

08:55.881 --> 08:57.883
- You think so?
- I think so.

08:57.966 --> 09:01.803
Give him a chance to catch up on all
that paperwork that he loves so much.

09:01.887 --> 09:04.599
- That's great. I'll go get packed.
- Okay.

09:42.598 --> 09:46.978
Little doves hovering around my birdbath.
It's charming, isn't it?

09:47.061 --> 09:49.146
You feel like a swim, Carl?

09:49.647 --> 09:51.775
Carl, take out your earplugs.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.403
- What?
- I asked if you'd like to swim.

09:54.486 --> 09:56.905
We got our usual interview
coming up pretty soon.

09:56.989 --> 09:58.615
Then you better get in costume.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.076
It's not until this afternoon, 2:00.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.079
Where's the bread from the D.C. gig?

10:03.162 --> 10:06.457
Stashed. In the vault, and in cash.

10:06.624 --> 10:07.959
Right on.

10:08.251 --> 10:11.963
Counting Boston and Philly,
we got almost half a million.

10:12.505 --> 10:14.550
How long are we going on?

10:15.134 --> 10:20.055
Until we bust them out the way
they busted me out all these years.

10:20.472 --> 10:22.850
- We're going again?
- And why not?

10:23.475 --> 10:25.185
Aren't you afraid we'll get caught?

10:25.269 --> 10:27.689
How are we going to get caught...

10:28.064 --> 10:31.651
when it's these little birdies
that are committing the robberies?

10:33.028 --> 10:35.322
Now get into costume,
and I'll do the thinking.

10:35.405 --> 10:36.656
Right.

11:25.210 --> 11:29.339
I have an immediate appointment
with Kelly, the local I.A.D.C. chief.

11:30.048 --> 11:32.884
I'll check us into the hotel
before I head out to UCLA.

11:32.967 --> 11:36.347
Forget about the hotel.
I'll take care of it after my meeting.

11:37.223 --> 11:38.808
- Diana?
- Yes.

11:38.891 --> 11:41.727
Tell Elena I'll be out to see her
the first chance I get.

11:41.811 --> 11:45.106
I will, Joe,
and just stop borrowing trouble. Okay?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.316
Everything's gonna be fine.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.403
I thought I'd done a good job with Elena.

11:49.486 --> 11:52.280
She's in college,
but it looks like I need the education.

11:52.364 --> 11:56.368
Stop it, Joe. You look like you belong
in the Lost and Found department.

11:56.451 --> 11:58.495
More lost than found, I'm afraid.

12:19.727 --> 12:21.061
You here for the interview?

12:21.145 --> 12:23.606
No. I'm looking for Elena Atkinson.

12:23.773 --> 12:26.192
They told me at the University
that she'd be here.

12:26.276 --> 12:28.653
I wouldn't know her
if she turned up in my soup.

12:28.737 --> 12:32.907
If I kept track of every girl who comes
and goes here, I'd go bananas. Excuse me.

12:32.991 --> 12:36.871
Belly dancer, you're right there.
Fairy. Yeah, go right in.

12:37.413 --> 12:38.748
See what I mean?

12:38.831 --> 12:40.958
- What's going on?
- Some kind of interview.

12:41.042 --> 12:43.252
A chance to appear on-stage
with Hamlin Rule.

12:43.336 --> 12:47.215
"The Girl in the Golden Basket. "
She turns into a snake.

12:47.424 --> 12:48.967
Sounds like fun.

12:49.051 --> 12:52.971
You couldn't prove it by me. All I know is
everybody's got to be in costume.

12:53.055 --> 12:54.848
So, why don't you get lost?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.934
Okay, thank you.

13:54.955 --> 13:57.041
You here for the interview?

13:57.375 --> 14:01.212
No, Carl. She goes around
posing as Wonder Woman all the time.

14:02.839 --> 14:05.883
You're really something else, man.
Let her by.

14:06.509 --> 14:07.802
Come in.

14:08.011 --> 14:10.139
- Come on in.
- Thank you. Hi.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.358
Isn't he a fox?

14:20.859 --> 14:23.737
I get the feeling
that we might be the hens.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.034
You all know how it goes.

14:29.659 --> 14:33.706
One of you is going to be chosen
"The Girl in the Golden Basket. "

14:34.248 --> 14:37.126
Everywhere I play, I get a different girl.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.504
It's like being chosen Miss Galaxy,
only better...

14:40.588 --> 14:43.090
'cause you get to hang out with me.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.344
Now, the hard part.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.971
Which one will it be?

15:02.653 --> 15:05.323
- You ever work without your tiara?
- No.

15:08.035 --> 15:10.371
Then I guess it's gonna have to be you.

15:10.454 --> 15:13.707
Go on upstairs.
I'll be up in a little bit. We'll rehearse.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.709
Actually, you're too tall.

15:15.793 --> 15:19.172
You would have been great, though,
for my bicentennial gig in '76.

15:19.255 --> 15:23.468
That's an incredible outfit. I love it.
I got my eagles, too. Nice to see you.

15:24.135 --> 15:27.055
Now, for the rest of you,
you can hang out if you want to.

15:27.138 --> 15:30.226
Anything you want, just ask.
And I mean anything.

15:31.310 --> 15:33.229
This is where it's at.

15:33.437 --> 15:35.564
And if that's not enough...

15:36.107 --> 15:39.902
I'll see you all get an autographed picture.
Okay? Follow me.

15:44.574 --> 15:45.951
Thank you.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.856
Elena.

16:16.066 --> 16:18.903
Diana. How did you...

16:19.738 --> 16:21.031
Dad sent you, didn't he?

16:21.114 --> 16:22.782
No, don't get all upset.

16:22.907 --> 16:25.618
Your dad's worried about you,
but he didn't send me.

16:25.702 --> 16:28.456
- I just came to see you-
- Yeah, I'm sure.

16:28.914 --> 16:31.709
- Tell him that-
- Why don't you tell him yourself?

16:31.792 --> 16:33.252
- Is he here, too?
- No.

16:33.336 --> 16:35.129
Diana, I thought you were my friend.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.298
I am your friend. You know that.

16:37.381 --> 16:39.300
Now, what are you doing in this place?

16:39.383 --> 16:41.970
I was chosen to be
"The Girl in the Golden Basket. "

16:42.054 --> 16:43.638
Now, what's that supposed to be.

16:43.722 --> 16:46.767
If you are a reporter, my dove,
you've had it.

16:47.142 --> 16:49.144
- How did she get in here?
- I don't know.

16:49.227 --> 16:51.313
I just walked in, and I'm not a reporter.

16:51.396 --> 16:52.690
Then who and what are you?

16:52.774 --> 16:55.318
I'm Diana Prince,
and I'm a good friend of Elena's.

16:55.401 --> 16:57.445
Is she telling it like it is, Elena?

16:57.528 --> 16:59.322
Well, more like it was.

16:59.405 --> 17:00.990
Can't we just be alone to talk?

17:01.074 --> 17:04.536
I'm afraid you're going to have
to buy a ticket to see Elena.

17:04.619 --> 17:06.829
I'm going to make her a star.

17:08.248 --> 17:11.210
- Show the lady the door, Carl.
- Now, wait a minute.

17:11.292 --> 17:13.420
Why don't you just come with me, hon?

17:13.503 --> 17:15.674
You don't believe this star routine,
do you?

17:15.757 --> 17:19.551
Nobody cared what I believed
till I found something I wanted.

17:20.011 --> 17:21.846
I'm not gonna leave, Diana.

17:21.930 --> 17:24.432
And you can tell my father
I don't care anymore.

17:24.516 --> 17:26.601
He cares. I care.

17:26.727 --> 17:28.186
Oh, very touching.

17:28.270 --> 17:31.357
But dig it, lady. Elena wants you to split.

17:34.860 --> 17:36.654
Mr. Rule said to show you the door.

17:36.737 --> 17:38.532
- I can walk.
- Then do it.

17:38.615 --> 17:40.492
Or I'll fix it so you can't.

17:40.575 --> 17:42.536
- I'm sure you can.
- Right on.

17:42.619 --> 17:44.246
- Elena.
- Move.

17:44.496 --> 17:45.789
Pleasure.

18:14.362 --> 18:16.865
Lay it on me. Who is Diana Prince?

18:18.283 --> 18:20.618
- She works for my father.
- That's cool.

18:20.702 --> 18:22.704
What kind of horn does your father blow?

18:22.787 --> 18:24.956
He's an agent for the I.A.D.C.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.043
Then she's an agent, too?

18:27.960 --> 18:29.587
That's not cool.

18:57.992 --> 19:00.412
If anything's gonna happen,
it will happen here.

19:01.663 --> 19:03.707
That would make it four rip-offs in a row.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.209
Rip-offs, Joe?

19:06.001 --> 19:08.128
These are the lab reports
from Washington.

19:08.212 --> 19:10.964
Those filings from the safe?
They were vibrated apart.

19:11.048 --> 19:12.425
They caused metal fatigue...

19:12.509 --> 19:15.220
and a rearrangement
of the lock's molecular structure.

19:15.303 --> 19:18.223
The scientific community's been working
on that for years.

19:18.306 --> 19:19.432
Any success?

19:19.516 --> 19:21.726
Not enough to reduce solid steel to dust.

19:21.810 --> 19:24.271
Then who could have such a device?

19:24.438 --> 19:28.234
As far as we know, no foreign countries
have anything approaching it yet.

19:28.317 --> 19:31.570
Then I guess our only hope is
that they follow the pattern.

19:32.613 --> 19:36.284
We'll have to set up a stakeout
at Rule's concert tonight.

19:36.827 --> 19:40.080
I'll coordinate it with the LAPD. Okay?

19:42.624 --> 19:44.668
- Hold it, I'm sorry.
- What?

19:45.794 --> 19:46.963
I'm losing my mind.

19:47.046 --> 19:49.257
I've got an appointment
with Lt. McMasters...

19:49.340 --> 19:52.260
about the stakeout in 10 minutes.
I'm sorry.

19:52.635 --> 19:54.971
Are you holding out on me, Joe?

19:55.430 --> 19:57.181
I guess I am, Diana.

19:57.682 --> 20:00.436
I phoned the university half a dozen times.

20:00.519 --> 20:02.521
Elena won't speak with me.

20:03.105 --> 20:04.815
I've seen her, Joe. She's okay.

20:04.898 --> 20:06.567
- Where?
- At Hamlin Rule's.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.318
- Doing what?
- She's rehearsing.

20:08.402 --> 20:11.364
She's got some crazy idea
about getting into show business.

20:11.448 --> 20:13.283
- Well, I'm going to stop her.
- How?

20:13.366 --> 20:16.661
She's over 18, and in the mood you're in,
you'll ruin everything.

20:16.745 --> 20:19.873
Believe me, I'll talk her out of it.
I promise.

20:20.415 --> 20:24.170
Now, why don't you go
and meet your Lt. McMasters? Go ahead.

20:24.253 --> 20:27.173
I guess I can afford
to lighten up a little bit.

20:27.256 --> 20:28.799
- Thanks, Diana.
- Sure.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.302
- I'll keep in contact.
- Okay.

20:43.982 --> 20:45.276
Delta Theta House.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.736
Elena Atkinson, please.

20:46.819 --> 20:48.946
This is her roommate. Is there a message?

20:49.030 --> 20:51.366
I'm Diana Prince, a friend of her father's.

20:51.449 --> 20:53.201
Do you know where I might reach her?

20:53.284 --> 20:54.994
I heard her talking on the phone.

20:55.078 --> 20:57.998
She mentioned something
about the Elura Recording Studio.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.042
That's the last I heard.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.169
Okay, thank you very much.

21:02.252 --> 21:03.337
Bye.

21:09.844 --> 21:12.847
May I please speak to the manager?
My name is Diana Prince.

21:12.931 --> 21:15.141
- Have you an appointment?
- No.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.108
There's a Miss Prince here to see you.

21:22.608 --> 21:24.652
Yes, sir, I will.

21:26.404 --> 21:30.449
He's in Studio B.
Down the hall, last door on your right.

21:30.825 --> 21:33.036
- Last door on my right.
- Right.

22:03.944 --> 22:05.988
Hello. Please sit down.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.245
I said to sit down, please.

22:16.207 --> 22:17.709
What is this?

22:17.792 --> 22:19.420
I said, sit down.

22:20.421 --> 22:21.589
Right.

22:27.011 --> 22:28.804
Okay, let me out of here.

22:28.888 --> 22:30.766
In time, Diana.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.392
- Sit down.
- No.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.728
I asked you to sit down.

23:31.790 --> 23:34.209
How about a little rock and roll,
Diana Prince?

23:34.292 --> 23:37.295
Nothing like a little bubble gum
to relax the bod.

23:40.006 --> 23:41.426
Who are you?

23:42.677 --> 23:45.096
Can't you get out of that secret agent bag?

23:45.179 --> 23:48.391
I'll crack the whip, and you take the trip.

23:48.474 --> 23:51.269
Why has the I.A.D.C. sent you here?

23:55.941 --> 23:58.068
She's going to need a little time.

23:58.694 --> 24:01.155
Wait outside and make sure
no one comes in here.

24:01.238 --> 24:02.364
Right.

24:04.325 --> 24:06.953
I am going to give Diana Prince...

24:07.746 --> 24:11.791
a little class in music appreciation.

24:13.835 --> 24:16.505
And to make sure you pay attention...

24:27.350 --> 24:31.063
Life is a rip-off, Diana.
The golden rule is backwards.

24:35.567 --> 24:38.570
If I didn't do it to you, you'd do it to me.

24:45.453 --> 24:46.871
Later.

25:25.705 --> 25:27.040
You again.

25:27.416 --> 25:28.959
Are you the real Wonder Woman?

25:29.042 --> 25:30.752
Don't make me prove it.

25:56.864 --> 25:58.240
Where's the Prince chick?

25:58.323 --> 26:01.953
She spun away.
I'd worry about myself if I were you.

26:02.203 --> 26:06.291
Let's just see
how strong you really are, lady.

26:15.926 --> 26:17.261
Easy, now.

26:48.253 --> 26:50.631
That's one way to use your head.

27:03.144 --> 27:06.773
Floor plans to the Cleft Concert Hall.

27:18.452 --> 27:22.874
So the only real lead is this floor plan,
and it came from Wonder Woman.

27:23.583 --> 27:27.963
Engineering says it's the floor plan of
the concert hall where Rule is appearing.

27:29.005 --> 27:33.135
Each time the box office of a Hamlin Rule
concert has been robbed...

27:33.218 --> 27:35.805
he's been onstage during the robbery.

27:37.014 --> 27:40.643
The only common elements present
during each of those concerts is...

27:40.727 --> 27:42.812
Let's see. Carl...

27:43.396 --> 27:45.899
Hamlin Rule himself, and fans.

27:46.442 --> 27:47.860
Female fans.

27:49.236 --> 27:51.697
That doesn't narrow it down much.

27:54.783 --> 27:57.912
I know that look, Diana.
You're onto something.

27:57.996 --> 28:00.415
Something, I just don't know what.

28:00.957 --> 28:03.877
I wish Elena wasn't
one of those female fans.

28:05.086 --> 28:09.550
Maybe you ought to go out to
the university and give it another try, Joe.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.719
- You think so?
- I think so.

28:14.722 --> 28:17.975
Just about all Carl could do
with his head was fill this hat.

28:18.059 --> 28:21.897
I could've painted a sign on his forehead,
"Out to Lunch. "

28:21.980 --> 28:24.733
But he was a good friend of yours,
wasn't he, Mr. Rule?

28:24.816 --> 28:27.444
Mr. Rule? Come on, call me Ham.

28:27.527 --> 28:31.156
Okay, Ham. But he was your friend?

28:32.240 --> 28:34.744
He needed a nametag
to find his way home at night.

28:34.827 --> 28:37.246
He was as useless
as those hummingbirds out there.

28:37.330 --> 28:39.999
But they love you. You're their idol.

28:40.124 --> 28:42.251
This year. And next year?

28:43.002 --> 28:44.170
Somebody else.

28:44.254 --> 28:47.216
But as long as they're here,
you can bet I'm gonna use them.

28:47.299 --> 28:48.383
How?

28:48.467 --> 28:51.762
That is where you come in, Elena.

28:52.221 --> 28:54.431
From now on, you're taking Carl's place.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.101
Your bodyguard?

28:56.684 --> 28:59.562
No, I can get any brainless bicep
to do that.

28:59.646 --> 29:02.190
You majored in business administration,
didn't you?

29:02.273 --> 29:03.608
Yeah, I still do.

29:03.900 --> 29:07.529
You've graduated. Hamlin cum laude.
School of hard rock.

29:07.905 --> 29:09.532
You'll be my financial adviser.

29:09.615 --> 29:12.785
I thought I was supposed
to be "The Girl in the Golden-"

29:12.868 --> 29:14.829
No, forget about show business.

29:14.912 --> 29:18.416
The real money is behind the scenes.
The box office.

29:18.707 --> 29:21.128
Come on, I'll show you. Follow me.

29:45.487 --> 29:47.656
Now, that is box office power.

29:47.740 --> 29:50.242
- I don't understand.
- Just sit down.

29:50.826 --> 29:53.495
Music! Sound!

29:55.206 --> 29:57.125
The most powerful weapon in the world.

29:57.208 --> 30:00.295
And they talk about charm
to soothe the savage beast.

30:00.378 --> 30:02.672
Scientists have been working on this
for years.

30:02.756 --> 30:05.383
But it took Hamlin Rule to perfect it.

30:06.051 --> 30:08.721
Why do you need something
that destroys things?

30:08.804 --> 30:10.806
Your songs are about love and happiness.

30:10.890 --> 30:13.976
That's for the squares.
On-stage they get what they pay for.

30:14.059 --> 30:18.148
I give them their money's worth.
Everybody gets what they want, but me.

30:18.231 --> 30:19.441
What do you want?

30:19.524 --> 30:21.860
Everything, Elena. That's all.

30:23.820 --> 30:26.907
But you owe something to your fans.
Honesty, something...

30:26.990 --> 30:29.326
I owe them nothing. They owe me.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.663
I'm sorry, I think I better be going.

30:32.747 --> 30:36.292
I'm sorry, I think you're
my business manager, remember?

30:36.417 --> 30:39.295
And one more thing.
You are controlled by my music.

30:39.378 --> 30:40.755
Part of my repertoire.

30:40.838 --> 30:42.758
You will remember what I want you to...

30:42.841 --> 30:44.718
and you will forget, and like that.

30:44.927 --> 30:48.138
You're no different than any of the chicks
that hang out here...

30:48.222 --> 30:52.267
except that your father's
a government agent. Now, can you dig it?

30:52.769 --> 30:56.564
I've been out to the university three times.
Twice she wouldn't see me...

30:56.648 --> 30:59.651
and now she's not even on campus.
I'm at the end of my rope.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.319
You think she's still at Rule's.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.279
I think so, yes.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.740
I'm going out to that house.

31:04.824 --> 31:08.494
Joe, wait. Trust me.
Nothing's happened to Elena.

31:08.869 --> 31:11.038
But she will be at the concert tonight.

31:11.122 --> 31:13.040
- Onstage?
- Yes, I think so.

31:13.124 --> 31:16.128
If I can get there early,
I can probably talk her out of it.

31:16.211 --> 31:19.089
So, trust me, I promise
everything will work itself out.

31:19.172 --> 31:22.384
It isn't any easier being a parent
than it is being a teenager.

31:29.225 --> 31:30.643
The girls are ready.

31:30.726 --> 31:33.438
Do they know
what they're supposed to do?

31:35.690 --> 31:36.858
I don't want to go.

31:36.941 --> 31:38.693
Not too cool, Elena.

31:39.486 --> 31:43.031
I've spent a lot of time
programming you and the others.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.037
A little traveling music might take away
that stubborn streak.

32:41.595 --> 32:43.514
I don't know how to use this.

32:43.597 --> 32:47.434
Part of the program. I've already taught
you. You just don't know it yet.

32:47.518 --> 32:50.688
You're not gonna have to kill anyone.
It's not even a real gun.

32:50.772 --> 32:53.024
It's just that Wonder Woman
is hanging around.

32:53.108 --> 32:55.777
If she wants to make another one
of her guest shots...

32:55.860 --> 32:59.114
I've devised a little something
to give her an encore.

33:00.323 --> 33:01.867
It will be a gas.

33:45.998 --> 33:47.124
We're standing by, Joe.

33:48.001 --> 33:49.169
You read me?

33:51.421 --> 33:52.505
All clear so far.

33:52.589 --> 33:54.966
I'll let you know as soon
as something goes down.

33:55.049 --> 33:56.134
Roger.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.202
Somebody's at the door.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.561
Joe, do you read me?

34:45.853 --> 34:47.690
I better get in there.

34:48.358 --> 34:50.652
- I'll call for a backup.
- Right.

34:51.444 --> 34:52.779
McMasters.

35:17.013 --> 35:19.766
Hold it. Freeze right there.

35:50.049 --> 35:51.926
Okay, just hold it.

36:11.615 --> 36:14.284
Mr. Atkinson, are you all right?

36:14.618 --> 36:15.827
Wonder Woman.

36:15.911 --> 36:18.747
I heard something in the corridor.

36:18.830 --> 36:20.917
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.586
I went towards the door...

36:24.253 --> 36:25.463
What happened?

36:25.588 --> 36:28.341
When I went towards the door,
it was like an earthquake.

36:28.424 --> 36:31.052
It all happened so quick, I can't remember.

36:33.305 --> 36:35.808
They were all girls. Masked.

36:36.725 --> 36:39.436
I didn't... I just couldn't...

36:39.520 --> 36:42.731
The musical pattern
obviously affects your memory.

36:47.445 --> 36:49.656
But what kind of weapon is it?

36:52.659 --> 36:55.454
There you go, ladies. Here, one for you.

36:56.497 --> 36:58.958
You got one. One for you.

37:00.709 --> 37:03.462
And thanks, really, to all of you.

37:04.171 --> 37:06.340
Hang in there. I love you.

37:09.886 --> 37:13.431
That may be the last group of girls
I'll be needing.

37:13.557 --> 37:15.475
- What do you mean?
- You.

37:15.851 --> 37:18.103
- You've solved my problems.
- Me?

37:18.186 --> 37:21.441
There's no reason for me to program
and deprogram them anymore.

37:21.524 --> 37:24.360
I'm glad you've decided
to give up this madness.

37:24.444 --> 37:26.320
"Refined" is just the word, Elena.

37:26.404 --> 37:31.201
You handled things so well last night,
I'll see if you can take over completely.

37:31.285 --> 37:33.537
- I don't want to.
- But you will.

37:33.829 --> 37:36.665
I guess it's time for a stronger serenade.

37:43.923 --> 37:46.968
Now we know
what disintegrated those locks.

37:47.051 --> 37:49.179
You sure you don't want
half this sandwich?

37:49.262 --> 37:52.015
No, thanks. My stomach wouldn't take it.

37:52.348 --> 37:55.269
We also know
there were four people involved.

37:56.145 --> 37:58.898
All masked. Not much to go on.

38:00.399 --> 38:03.694
I'm still convinced there's a tie-in
somewhere with Hamlin Rule.

38:03.778 --> 38:05.864
It's just too coincidental.

38:07.657 --> 38:08.867
What is it, Officer?

38:08.950 --> 38:10.410
I'm not sure.

38:11.536 --> 38:13.663
Maybe you'd better take a look at it.

38:13.747 --> 38:17.960
It was found on the floor near the safe.
It has an inscription on it.

38:25.968 --> 38:29.556
"Elena, happy 16th. Love, Dad. " Oh, Joe.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.076
Joe, this bracelet could have been planted.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.329
It also could have fallen
from Elena's wrist during the robbery.

38:51.412 --> 38:55.334
It doesn't add up. Unless you believe
that she was in on the Philadelphia...

38:55.417 --> 38:58.879
the Boston and the Washington jobs, too.
And she was in school then.

38:58.963 --> 39:00.881
How do I know she was in school?

39:00.965 --> 39:02.716
Okay, let's look at it this way.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.470
How could Elena get hold
of a sound device like that...

39:05.554 --> 39:07.472
unless she was brainwashed?

39:07.556 --> 39:08.598
That's a thought.

39:08.682 --> 39:12.102
Does anyone outside the police
and I.A.D.C. know about the bracelet?

39:12.185 --> 39:15.523
Not yet. I could hold release on anything
until you give the word.

39:15.606 --> 39:18.109
- How much time have we got?
- How much do you need?

39:18.192 --> 39:20.862
Enough to pay a visit on Mr. Hamlin Rule.

39:20.945 --> 39:22.321
You got it.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.816
Joe, wait.

39:56.567 --> 39:59.028
I think it's better if I just
talk to him alone.

39:59.111 --> 40:00.821
- I want to go.
- Listen to me.

40:00.905 --> 40:03.033
I know that you're
a very professional man.

40:03.116 --> 40:05.660
But do you honestly think it's wise?

40:08.663 --> 40:12.375
You're right, Diana.
I guess I'm just a father, after all.

40:12.918 --> 40:15.254
Don't apologize for being human.

40:15.463 --> 40:19.300
Don't worry about me. If I do get
into trouble, I'll yell very loud.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.135
- You do that.
- Okay.

40:32.314 --> 40:33.607
Help me.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.109
Please.

40:37.195 --> 40:38.404
Somebody.

40:51.460 --> 40:53.921
Please help me.

41:34.381 --> 41:36.176
Okay, back off, lady.

41:36.885 --> 41:39.053
- Get lost!
- Not without her.

41:39.304 --> 41:40.555
Hold it!

41:41.306 --> 41:43.224
Unless you want me to use this thing.

41:43.308 --> 41:45.435
Why have you been robbing
your own concerts?

41:45.518 --> 41:47.563
That bread belonged to me.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.064
Now move.

42:09.503 --> 42:11.422
Atkinson to all units, I'm going in.

42:24.770 --> 42:27.189
- You call yourself The Pied Piper.
- Yes.

42:27.272 --> 42:29.942
But the real Pied Piper led children
from danger.

42:30.025 --> 42:32.110
Why would you lead children into danger?

42:32.194 --> 42:35.907
You were given a gift: the ability
to make people happy with your music.

42:35.990 --> 42:40.495
Instead, you took that gift and used it
to make children steal for you. Why?

42:40.578 --> 42:44.374
When I was first coming up,
I used to play for nothing on sidewalks.

42:44.457 --> 42:48.254
Then, after that, the producers,
the publishers, and all the parasites...

42:48.337 --> 42:50.840
took credit for my music,
and most of the money.

42:50.923 --> 42:54.218
I had three gold albums
and no gold in the bank. It was the pits!

42:54.301 --> 42:57.848
Do you think that you were given this gift,
this incredible talent...

42:57.931 --> 42:58.974
simply to make money?

42:59.057 --> 43:01.852
What's money compared
to the happiness that you gave...

43:01.935 --> 43:03.436
and still give?

43:03.770 --> 43:06.690
You write lovely poems
and set them to beautiful music.

43:06.773 --> 43:09.610
The mention of your name
can fill an entire concert hall.

43:09.694 --> 43:11.904
They don't get in for free.
They have to pay.

43:11.988 --> 43:15.408
It's the promoters that go to Fat City.
I go to Hamlin.

43:15.491 --> 43:17.785
And Hamlin's the other side of the tracks.

43:17.869 --> 43:19.620
I'm some Pied Piper.

43:21.039 --> 43:24.918
Take a look around you, Hamlin.
This is hardly the other side of the tracks.

43:25.002 --> 43:27.171
I'm stealing from thieves to pay creditors.

43:27.254 --> 43:30.299
Just because those men stole from you
doesn't make it right.

43:30.382 --> 43:34.053
And it doesn't make it right,
what you did to Elena and the other girls.

43:34.137 --> 43:36.806
They loved you, and probably still do.

43:37.265 --> 43:39.184
Leave me alone, please.

43:39.893 --> 43:42.145
I can leave you alone, Hamlin.

43:43.354 --> 43:45.900
But can you be alone with yourself?

43:46.525 --> 43:47.818
I don't need anybody.

43:47.902 --> 43:51.113
That's not what you write.
That's not what you play.

43:51.197 --> 43:53.699
I don't think it's what you believe.

43:54.575 --> 43:57.120
I don't know what I believe anymore.

43:57.913 --> 44:01.166
Anyway, no one cares.

44:01.333 --> 44:03.126
No one really cares.

44:03.502 --> 44:06.505
I care, Hamlin. I really do.

44:07.005 --> 44:10.009
After what I did to you? How can you?

44:11.344 --> 44:14.013
Because you give what's in your heart.

44:22.856 --> 44:25.067
There's no price tag on that.

44:25.526 --> 44:28.195
Can't you see how foolish you've been?

44:29.321 --> 44:32.283
Mr. Atkinson,
the I.A.D.C. does know about the power...

44:32.367 --> 44:35.203
of this young man's weapon?
The one that I destroyed?

44:35.286 --> 44:37.247
Of course. Otherwise we wouldn't be here.

44:37.330 --> 44:39.040
Then they must certainly know...

44:39.123 --> 44:42.878
that Hamlin Rule only took
that of which he felt he'd been cheated.

44:43.671 --> 44:46.090
I don't follow you, Wonder Woman.

44:46.841 --> 44:49.593
He could have used his musical device
to rob a bank.

44:49.677 --> 44:51.846
He could have sold it to a foreign country.

44:51.929 --> 44:54.641
He might have even used it
to knock off the Mint, Dad.

44:54.724 --> 44:56.184
It's too late.

44:58.436 --> 44:59.896
It's never too late, Hamlin.

44:59.980 --> 45:03.441
What those men did to you was wrong,
but what you did was wrong, too.

45:03.525 --> 45:06.362
And what do they say
about two wrongs, Dad?

45:06.863 --> 45:09.198
It's not my job to judge, Elena.

45:09.740 --> 45:11.617
Hey, I'm Hamlin Rule.

45:11.993 --> 45:15.329
I'm too hip to deal in any clichés
about two wrongs.

45:17.039 --> 45:18.584
I mean, I can't.

45:19.418 --> 45:20.669
It's not cool.

45:22.254 --> 45:25.591
What? "Two bummers, two bring-downs...

45:25.716 --> 45:29.971
"two bad scenes don't...

45:31.014 --> 45:34.976
"make it cool. Two bad scenes just...

45:36.811 --> 45:39.606
"make a fool. "

45:40.774 --> 45:42.359
That's not bad.

45:43.777 --> 45:46.113
Where's that old guitar of mine?

45:59.878 --> 46:03.507
- He may have a long time to write this hit.
- Daddy...

46:05.510 --> 46:08.888
Maybe he'll write this one
for charity, Mr. Atkinson.

46:12.266 --> 46:15.604
So, you actually planted that bracelet,
hoping it would be found?

46:15.687 --> 46:18.148
What are you trying to do,
become a secret agent?

46:18.232 --> 46:22.027
- You're a stubborn little brat.
- Maybe I should join the I.A.D.C.

46:22.110 --> 46:25.280
Joe, I wonder where she got
that stubborn streak.

46:25.572 --> 46:26.907
Stubborn? Me?

46:26.990 --> 46:29.327
Yeah. Hamlin Rule told me
how stubborn I was.

46:29.410 --> 46:32.038
I must have gotten it from somewhere.

46:32.831 --> 46:35.041
That's one thing we agree on.

46:35.124 --> 46:37.794
You know, I just don't understand him.

46:38.586 --> 46:41.507
I think that he just wasn't content
with his gift for music.

46:41.590 --> 46:44.635
On-stage, he had an audience
in the palm of his hand.

46:44.718 --> 46:46.345
But he wanted their minds, too.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.597
And their money. Don't forget that part.

46:48.848 --> 46:49.890
Right.

46:49.974 --> 46:52.853
I find it hard to forgive him
for what he did to my daughter.

46:52.936 --> 46:56.481
I wouldn't be too hard on him, Joe.
He was just a far-out Pied Piper...

46:56.565 --> 46:57.774
who went a little too far.

46:57.858 --> 47:02.154
I think the first thing a judge will do
is order a psychiatric observation period.

47:02.237 --> 47:03.739
I think you're right.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.926
And Hamlin Rule thought
he could play the flute.

48:08.392 --> 48:09.435
