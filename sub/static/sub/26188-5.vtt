00:02.000 --> 00:05.360
This programme contains
strong language from the start.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.240
This is a problem for you?

00:07.240 --> 00:11.360
Not for me, Blake,
but it clearly is for them.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.120
And they pay the bills, or at least
their church does.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.280
Then have them speak to my clerk.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.920
It's your bonus.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.000
You don't think I deserve it?
A fee of this size...

00:29.480 --> 00:31.040
..who does?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.360
Me.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.880
For the work I do for you.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.480
Ordinary mortals would never
have to work again.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.360
Ordinary mortals wouldn't
touch this case.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.600
We are all ordinary mortals
in the eyes of the Lord.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.120
Yeah, well the Lord doesn't pay
my bills. And nor will we.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.960
If I decide to sue you, it won't
matter how many church fetes

01:04.960 --> 01:07.560
you have under whatever tin
roof it is you come from,

01:07.560 --> 01:10.400
there won't be enough beady
bracelets in the whole of the

01:10.400 --> 01:15.160
fucking Congo to pay for your
defence. Just as I thought.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.400
What did you think? I am looking
into the eyes of a devil.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.040
No. That was me.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.760
Last time I met with YOUR client.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.880
And trust me, when I look into the
soul of things, I look deep,

01:28.880 --> 01:34.240
and I did not like what I saw.
In him? Or You?

01:37.880 --> 01:39.800
Pay the piper, Padre.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.080
Or I'll pipe the rats right back.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.080
Actually, I'm a pastor.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.280
Yeah?

01:56.040 --> 01:57.800
Then go boil some milk.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.040
See you, fellas.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.520
HE VOMITS

02:50.600 --> 02:53.160
HE WHEEZES

03:00.160 --> 03:03.440
MUSIC: You Want It Darker
by Leonard Cohen

03:07.080 --> 03:11.720
# If you are the dealer,
I'm out of the game

03:11.720 --> 03:16.000
# If you are the healer,
it means I'm broken and lame

03:16.000 --> 03:21.440
# If thine is the glory
then mine must be the shame

03:21.440 --> 03:26.800
# You want it darker
We kill the flame

03:34.160 --> 03:38.440
# Magnified, sanctified,
be thy holy name

03:38.440 --> 03:42.600
# Vilified, crucified,
in the human frame

03:42.600 --> 03:47.440
# A million candles burning
for the help that never came

03:47.440 --> 03:50.760
# You want it darker

03:56.040 --> 03:58.160
# Hineni, hineni

03:59.520 --> 04:01.480
# I'm ready, my Lord. #

04:08.440 --> 04:10.840
I wasn't supposed to be here.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.440
My mother was due to
talk with you today.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.560
But instead you've got me.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.760
My mother wanted two things for me.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.160
First, to defeat the evil that
had touched me, and second,

04:26.160 --> 04:29.160
for that evil to see me grow
stronger than it could ever

04:29.160 --> 04:30.640
have imagined possible.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.720
When I came here as a student,

04:34.720 --> 04:40.240
it wasn't a thirst for knowledge
that drove me, or revenge,

04:40.240 --> 04:43.560
or anger, or even gratitude for the

04:43.560 --> 04:46.120
marvellous generosity of others.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.160
No.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.000
The only thing that drove me
was fear.

04:53.760 --> 05:00.520
Fear that whatever it was I had
escaped from would catch up

05:00.520 --> 05:02.800
and devour me the moment I stopped.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.240
So I didn't.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.200
I pushed on,

05:09.200 --> 05:12.840
higher, faster, further.

05:14.680 --> 05:18.880
Until two years ago when I came to
an abrupt full stop -

05:18.880 --> 05:20.520
self-inflicted.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.520
Because that's when I realised
that it doesn't matter

05:27.520 --> 05:32.320
how far you think you've gone
or who tries to help you get there.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.680
I could never outrun
what was chasing me, never.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.120
Because once you've been
touched by evil,

05:51.120 --> 05:52.920
it never lets go.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.840
It worms its way inside of you,

05:58.840 --> 06:01.960
sits there, grows there...

06:05.040 --> 06:08.600
..until the day you suddenly realise
that the thing you're most

06:08.600 --> 06:11.080
afraid of being caught by,
it's already there...

06:16.360 --> 06:18.800
..right in the heart of you.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.000
And nothing you can do will ever
defeat it.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.840
I'm sorry about that.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.800
Mr Gaines, sir!

06:51.800 --> 06:54.320
I am so sorry. They,
they, they just told me.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.360
I would have brought the car
around the front. It's all right.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.440
I just decided to call it a day.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.720
A weekend!

07:01.920 --> 07:05.200
Oh, yeah, so it is.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.880
So, where to, sir?

07:09.080 --> 07:11.840
Why do I have so many houses,
Samson?

07:11.840 --> 07:13.920
Because you are a rich man, sir.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.880
Mmm.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.520
If I had a man who loved me,
that'd be the only home I'd need.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.120
I've shocked you.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.000
Really?

07:36.120 --> 07:37.640
You'll get used to it.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.560
"What does it profit a man to gain
the world, only to lose his soul?"

07:42.560 --> 07:48.760
Huh. And there was me thinking I'd
cover myself in all this

07:48.760 --> 07:51.000
bulletproof glass.
CAR UNLOCKS

08:03.400 --> 08:06.360
So, where to, Mr Gaines?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.560
You choose.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.560
Jura House.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.200
Good choice.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.880
Today I want to talk to you about...

08:33.680 --> 08:35.160
..greed.

08:38.960 --> 08:46.400
One day Jesus said to the crowd,
"Watch out...
ENGINES REV

08:46.400 --> 08:50.760
"Be on your guard against all kinds
of greed."

08:53.360 --> 08:56.960
Then Jesus told them this parable.

08:58.440 --> 09:03.920
"The grounds of a certain rich man
yielded an abundant harvest.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.560
"The rich man thought to himself,
'I have no place to store my
crops.'

09:12.760 --> 09:16.760
"Then the rich man said,
'This is what I will do.

09:18.920 --> 09:25.800
" 'I will tear down my barns and
build bigger ones, and there I will

09:25.800 --> 09:28.800
" 'store my surplus grain' ".

09:28.800 --> 09:31.360
Samson. Morning, Mr Gaines.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.320
Are you looking to drown
the Maldives? Sorry, sir?

09:38.320 --> 09:43.360
What are you up to? Just putting
them all back in order. Hmm.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.360
You got anyone here with you today,
Mr Gaines? Why?

09:48.360 --> 09:51.720
Well, help shunt these beauties
around.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.160
No-one I'd trust.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.200
Well, you've got me, sir.
We can do it together.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.960
Do you mind jumping in the 981?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.160
What for?

10:09.160 --> 10:13.640
I think the GT3 deserves
pole position, don't you?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.760
I'll give it a go.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.440
Mr Gaines, sir.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.960
Do you have your phone on you?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.400
Why?

10:30.400 --> 10:35.080
There's a problem with the front
gate, just in case they call.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.520
No, I don't.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.960
It's fine, I, I've got mine.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.960
Good.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.640
PASTOR: " 'And I will say to myself,

10:45.640 --> 10:52.760
" 'You have plenty of grain left for
many years. Take life easy.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.320
" 'Eat, drink and be merry.' "

10:58.120 --> 11:01.880
There's no key...
ENGINE REVS

11:01.880 --> 11:04.240
Hey!
HORN HONKS

11:04.240 --> 11:06.200
What the fuck are you doing?

11:15.040 --> 11:18.520
My name is not Samson.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.040
I can't hear you.
My name is not Samson.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.160
Oh? No.

11:31.160 --> 11:35.240
It is Nkanza a Nkanga
of the House of Kinlaza.

11:38.360 --> 11:43.200
OK. I come from a line of
Congolese kings.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.400
Good for you.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.320
But now only God is my master.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.200
Oh.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.560
PASTOR: "And God said to the
rich man, 'You fool...

12:01.760 --> 12:06.440
" '..this very night your
life will be demanded from you.' "

13:08.560 --> 13:10.800
HE COUGHS

13:27.400 --> 13:30.800
Fuck it.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.880
HORN BLARES

14:31.720 --> 14:36.240
PASTOR: This is the parable
of the rich fool.

14:41.560 --> 14:45.560
With God his only master!

14:58.600 --> 15:00.200
Amen.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.440
Breaking the soil.

15:08.440 --> 15:13.240
Harvesting the crops,
cooking the food.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.960
Always.

15:14.960 --> 15:19.320
My father said my mother even sang
when giving birth to me.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.000
I know she sang me to sleep,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.320
every night.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.920
Always.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.240
Nothing happens "just like that".

15:30.240 --> 15:34.960
We went into exile 27 years
before the genocide.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.000
The Belgians had gone,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.080
the Hutus had come to power and the
Tutsis were being thrown out.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.120
We stayed for as long as we could

15:47.120 --> 15:49.320
until we could not stay any more.

15:51.360 --> 15:55.840
We lived by the river where the
water ran slow.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.400
My father said that, should we ever
journey south,

15:58.400 --> 16:00.640
we could never get lost,

16:00.640 --> 16:06.920
because all life returns to the
bend in our river,

16:06.920 --> 16:09.800
and the dead, too.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.240
And that is where we first saw her,

16:15.240 --> 16:17.640
sitting with her family,

16:17.640 --> 16:20.720
younger than me and half my weight.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.320
But still she had managed to
pull them out.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.400
She would not move until my mother,
having packed our world in

16:28.400 --> 16:34.360
three sacks, claimed her as the last
fruit from our fields,

16:34.360 --> 16:37.400
tied her to her back,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.920
and sung us all the way to Uganda.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.160
It took many, many months

16:48.160 --> 16:53.280
before Bibi Mundanzi
began to sing back.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.360
And then she claimed us
as her family,

16:56.360 --> 16:59.760
and my mother claimed
a new daughter.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.400
Until one day, again,
we found her by the river.

17:11.480 --> 17:16.120
It was poison from the water,
but when the others saw her,

17:16.120 --> 17:21.040
they thought the poison came from
her and they became afraid of

17:21.040 --> 17:23.280
my white-eyed sister.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.240
So my mother sung us north again,

17:28.240 --> 17:32.480
until the whispers did not follow.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.120
And there we stayed.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.480
There we grew.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.120
There we took back our lives.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.240
And then, one day,

17:48.240 --> 17:52.040
we took back our country,

17:52.040 --> 17:53.640
my sister and I.

17:59.720 --> 18:06.800
And the white eyes of Bibi
Mundanzi were never seen again.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.600
So, there you go.

18:17.640 --> 18:21.320
Sisters? I never realised that.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.200
She was never my sister.
Close enough.

18:26.320 --> 18:32.400
Well, now she has become the
"mother" of our nation.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.880
No longer a sister, now a parent.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.760
With draconian house rules,
would you not say?

18:37.760 --> 18:41.040
Who else knows? It is no secret.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.440
That she's a witch.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.080
She is not.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.800
There was a time.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.800
You might want to use that.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.480
Jawbones and tooth rattles?

18:53.480 --> 18:56.720
I'm going to pretend
I did not hear that.

18:56.720 --> 19:01.320
Ours is a modern society, looking to
take its place in a modern world.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.680
There is no "magic" in it.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.720
Why did you give Kate that
piece of cloth? It belongs to her.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.960
Why now? You know why.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.040
It feels pretty manipulative.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.160
Having another Chuck Yeager moment,
Mikey? Yes, I am.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.840
As a matter of fact, if I'm not
wearing a space suit these days,

19:36.840 --> 19:38.960
I find it increasingly
hard to breathe.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.120
We have not been comfortable with
any of this for over 20 years.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.080
Why don't we just tell her and
have done with it?

19:49.080 --> 19:54.880
Because we agreed, all of us -
you, me, Eunice and Eve -

19:54.880 --> 20:00.000
the moment she hears the truth,
everyone else has to hear it, too.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.480
You want to talk about manipulation,
talk about my sister.

20:05.480 --> 20:10.240
The constitution, the penal code,
political space, press freedoms.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.440
And you want to call her to
account on any of that?

20:13.440 --> 20:15.640
Then this is the only way to do it.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.360
By using the personal history of an
extremely traumatised

20:20.360 --> 20:22.280
28-year-old-woman.

20:26.360 --> 20:32.800
Oh, Michael, you are forgetting...

20:32.800 --> 20:37.920
..in my country, we are all
traumatised.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.400
Every single one.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.480
Me included.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.880
And all I am trying to do
is to help us come to terms with it.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.280
Please, help me?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.280
MONITOR BEEPS REGULARLY

21:43.680 --> 21:46.960
BEEPS INCREASE RAPIDLY

22:00.760 --> 22:02.400
BEEPS RETURN TO REGULAR PATTERN

22:09.800 --> 22:11.120
So, what is it?

22:11.120 --> 22:13.640
HE SIGHS

22:13.640 --> 22:18.520
I have to tell you,
you are something of a conundrum.

22:19.920 --> 22:24.320
To have these kind of seizures
as a child is not so unusual.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.440
Neither it is so for them to go away
once you enter adulthood, but

22:28.440 --> 22:31.840
for them to return at a mature stage
of your adult life, that is rare.

22:36.120 --> 22:42.240
So much so it's possible that your
suffering is not epilepsy at all.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.720
What else could it be?

22:44.760 --> 22:45.960
Your past.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.000
Your present.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.080
Trauma has many ways of
finding a way out,

22:50.080 --> 22:52.920
particularly if it's been
suppressed.

22:54.960 --> 22:59.600
You Westerners are so self-centred -
everything about the me.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.880
There's nobody else in the room.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.360
I am president of my nation.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.640
Of course. And now is not the time
for my nation

23:10.640 --> 23:11.880
to be seeing a "shrink".

23:13.280 --> 23:15.600
So we'll go with the TVNS.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.800
I will feel it?
A local tingling, no more.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.880
It's a device you attach
to your ear.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.560
Visibly?

23:22.560 --> 23:23.880
Yes.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.160
It cannot be visible.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.200
It's like a hearing aid thing, in
fact, that's what you can say it is.

23:28.200 --> 23:32.000
I will say that I have been deafened
by the guns of liberation.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.760
If I were you, President Mundanzi,

23:33.760 --> 23:36.640
I'd try and find a way of telling
them the truth.

23:36.640 --> 23:40.680
If you were me,
you would know there is only so much
truth that my country can hear.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.680
Maybe that's why I'm going deaf.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.960
MAN VOMITS

24:07.640 --> 24:09.000
SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

24:12.080 --> 24:13.120
HE CHUCKLES

24:20.760 --> 24:22.720
Then he'd be ahead of the CIA.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.760
We are ahead of the CIA?

24:28.680 --> 24:29.720
Yeah.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.360
But it's probably good that
you're going back now.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.680
She is here.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.360
She knows you're about to go.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.400
Are you all right?

24:51.520 --> 24:52.680
Yes.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.200
Are you sure? Yes!

25:17.440 --> 25:18.800
SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

25:23.440 --> 25:26.360
That is not a very good way
of going about it.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.360
I had to see you.
Everyone was watching.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.280
The college is being told there's a
problem with your visa,

25:33.280 --> 25:34.720
it'll be sorted by this afternoon.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.600
And you keep telling me to be
discreet.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.360
I couldn't just leave.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.320
I chose this clinic so I
could be close.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.760
You're two hours away.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.640
Better than half the world.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.640
Are you OK?

25:51.640 --> 25:53.000
I'll be fine.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.520
Well, what is wrong?

25:54.520 --> 25:56.400
My hearing. It's fine, it's nothing.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.360
Was it a good lesson?

26:01.360 --> 26:04.040
Bernoulli's equation,
it's part of fluid dynamics.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.720
My daughter, the astrophysicist!

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
I got most of my education
beneath a tamarind tree!

26:13.000 --> 26:14.880
And look where that got you.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.520
I hate all of this.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.920
What else can I do? Give it up!

26:24.200 --> 26:27.280
You've got everything you need...
Except a mother!

26:27.280 --> 26:30.240
Don't be cross.
What else do you expect me to be?

26:30.240 --> 26:34.240
I have spent half of my life living
with strangers and now I, I

26:34.240 --> 26:36.400
don't even know who you are.

26:36.400 --> 26:40.480
Except this woman I have to meet in
weird places surrounded by

26:40.480 --> 26:42.560
dangerous looking men!

26:42.560 --> 26:45.120
It is hard. No, Navier-Stokes
equations are hard,

26:45.120 --> 26:46.960
but this is impossible!

26:46.960 --> 26:50.560
But you are safe.
From what? Mumma!

26:50.560 --> 26:53.600
Nobody in my life wants to kill me,
it is only in yours!

26:54.800 --> 26:56.720
Do you think that's fair?

26:56.720 --> 26:59.320
That I have to live my life because
of your choices?!

27:04.280 --> 27:05.920
Tell me about your boyfriend...

27:05.920 --> 27:08.600
I'm not going to tell you about my
fucking boyfriend!

27:08.600 --> 27:10.480
Not least because I told you
already.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.560
Joseph.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.320
His name is Joseph.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.560
Joseph and Mary,
that has got to be good, huh?

27:18.560 --> 27:21.600
Actually, we had an argument.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.480
About what?

27:23.480 --> 27:25.280
What do you care?

27:25.280 --> 27:28.160
How are you going to fix it?

27:28.160 --> 27:29.400
By sending in the army?!

27:33.080 --> 27:35.960
I want you to be happy, that is all.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.080
I want a mother, that is all!

27:42.600 --> 27:43.960
I don't want her like this!

27:46.120 --> 27:47.200
I'm sorry.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.600
When are you going?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.960
Now.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.920
Well, then go.
It's OK, I have a few...

27:57.920 --> 28:02.920
More minutes? Really?
How wonderful! I am so lucky!

28:02.920 --> 28:05.120
I have lost years, Mumma!

28:05.120 --> 28:07.440
Years. And I am never going to
get them back!

28:07.440 --> 28:12.280
A father that I never knew and a
mother who never knew me!

28:13.360 --> 28:15.160
How is that for an upbringing?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.600
ENGINE STARTS

29:00.720 --> 29:03.560
You're not wearing your ear thing.

29:03.560 --> 29:07.040
Hmmm? No.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.120
You don't have to wear it
all the time?

29:09.120 --> 29:10.600
Just a few hours a day.

29:12.440 --> 29:16.040
When we arrive back, be sure that
you are wearing it then.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.160
"Deafened by the guns
of liberation."

29:19.560 --> 29:20.840
I like that.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.960
Yes? Mm, completely.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.640
You have a knack for this
sort of thing.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.680
Maybe I should run for president.
You already have.

29:30.680 --> 29:33.960
Hmm. Three times.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.400
It was the right thing to do.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.600
The only thing.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.520
SOFTLY: I'm tired, David.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.960
I know.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.040
SHE SIGHS

30:07.920 --> 30:10.040
So, Patrice Ganimana.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.240
It looks like we have a good
chance to extradite.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.400
Even from the UK?

30:15.320 --> 30:16.560
I'm working on it.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.120
Huh.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.840
The old world is falling.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.520
As I said.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.560
See?

30:28.040 --> 30:29.080
Stay strong.

30:30.800 --> 30:31.840
All will be well.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.880

30:47.800 --> 30:49.320
# To always be looking forward

34:53.440 --> 34:54.800
Are you allowed to do that?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.760
Why are you here?

34:59.760 --> 35:01.920
Give me your phone.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.080
What?

35:03.080 --> 35:04.840
Give it to me. Why?

35:04.840 --> 35:06.640
You want me to help you?

35:06.640 --> 35:08.520
No.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.720
You do not trust me?

35:09.720 --> 35:12.280
No. Last time I gave you
Father Patenaude.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.800
Yeah. And took a man's eye out.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.960
He was a liar.

35:16.960 --> 35:21.520
And you're not?
Then tell me who you work for.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.640
Someone who wants to keep you safe.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.160
That's, that's not an answer.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.480
It is if you're in danger.
Am I in danger? Yeah.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.040
Who from?

35:33.040 --> 35:35.800
Please, give me your phone.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.720
Why?
I cannot watch you all the time.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.720
Yeah, I don't want you to
watch me at all!

35:39.720 --> 35:41.200
And they know it.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.240
Who's they?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.960
So if someone comes, and they
might...

35:48.240 --> 35:49.360
..you should call me.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.240
This is ridiculous.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.600
Wasn't before, isn't now.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.600
Unlock it.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.760
"A", double "H".

36:21.760 --> 36:23.040
"Ahh"?

36:24.520 --> 36:25.560
Ha-ha.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.800
That lawyer you spoke to
worked for Ganimana.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.120
You are following me.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.160
He's dead.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.160
How?

36:39.160 --> 36:40.200
Dead.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.880
So any trouble?

36:42.880 --> 36:44.160
Call "Ahh". I'm serious!

36:47.320 --> 36:49.280
And stay away from Patrice Ganimana.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.360
Passion fruit?

37:09.240 --> 37:10.760
Maybe melon, do you want some?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.000
So?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.840
So? What do you expect me to say?

37:16.840 --> 37:18.120
Whatever you think.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.760
He's right. Stay away from Ganimana.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.720
He works for you?
Me?

37:25.720 --> 37:28.640
If I had access to an
extra-judicial hit man,

37:28.640 --> 37:30.800
do you think I'd be wasting my
time here presenting

37:30.800 --> 37:34.800
The Infrastructure Projects Team
of the Year?

37:34.800 --> 37:36.560
So whose is he?

37:37.640 --> 37:40.600
My guess, Bibi Mundanzi,

37:40.600 --> 37:46.040
which means the table stakes you're
playing at are pretty fucking high!

37:46.040 --> 37:47.360
No.

37:47.360 --> 37:52.080
No, she wants Ganimana extradited,
why would they want to keep me away?

37:52.080 --> 37:55.040
Unlike you.
I hoped the UN would pick him up.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.320
Well, it didn't work out that way,
did it?

37:59.640 --> 38:03.240
No, it didn't.
So, now it's just down to them.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.280
Them?

38:06.360 --> 38:09.120
Why did David Runihura go
and see you?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.080
I told you, I can't say.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.440
Was it for a file, Michael?

38:14.560 --> 38:20.480
On Patrice Ganimana, drawn up
by Eve, by my mother, in '97?

38:22.360 --> 38:23.600
He came to see you.

38:26.400 --> 38:30.160
He wants me to fly out there
and write a report on the state

38:30.160 --> 38:31.200
of their judiciary.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.520
And you said yes?

38:36.120 --> 38:37.360
Think I just have.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.120
I pay your bills, Kate.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.960
And I think I've also just resigned.

38:45.040 --> 38:49.200
The Rwandan judiciary does not have
the capability of trying a

38:49.200 --> 38:50.640
Transfer case, not on their own.

38:50.640 --> 38:51.800
Says who?

38:51.800 --> 38:55.800
This country, last year -
six - right to a fair trial.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.640
A lot of other countries disagree.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.520
And they're looking to you to prove
the British judiciary wrong?

39:00.520 --> 39:02.920
That's a pretty tall order,
Kate, even for you.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.520
Well, you didn't seem to think so
when you had me working for Alice.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.000
Then you had me.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.520
Out there, you'll be on your own.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.960
No, no, I'll be with people willing
to prosecute

39:11.960 --> 39:13.200
the very man you're not.

39:16.320 --> 39:20.680
I'd like nothing better than to see
Ganimana brought to justice.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.680
If, when he does,
that's what actually happens.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.080
You know what's really unsettling?

39:26.080 --> 39:28.240
It's not just your behaviour,
it's my mother's.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.040
To discover she'd even drawn up a
file against this guy,

39:31.040 --> 39:34.080
but instead of prosecuting
the fucker, she decided to go for

39:34.080 --> 39:37.160
Simon Nyamoya instead, a man who'd
brought the genocide to a close!

39:37.160 --> 39:38.560
It wasn't like that. No?

39:38.560 --> 39:42.400
So why is Patrice Ganimana sitting
two miles away with you

39:42.400 --> 39:44.560
DOING NOTHING TO HELP?!

39:54.960 --> 39:56.320
Where's that file?

39:59.200 --> 40:00.600
You're being played.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.320
Hmm.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.600
Yeah, I think I am.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.040
Stay away from Ganimana.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.840
Says you and your
paramilitary buddy.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.080
He's very dangerous.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.880
Yeah, took a guy's eye out.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.800
Ganimana.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.800
Because of Blake Gaines?
I looked it up.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.520
Suicide.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.280
Working for a man who's pure evil,
I think I'd do the same.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.120
Which is why I want you to
stay away from him.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.480
And that's why I wanted YOU to help!

40:31.760 --> 40:33.360
Not like this.

40:43.280 --> 40:47.120
What's that, that Yeats poem...

40:48.920 --> 40:50.600
..about it all going to shit?

40:53.400 --> 40:58.200
You're better educated than I am,
Kate, Eve made sure of that.

41:00.600 --> 41:04.640
Well, it's a shame then...

41:06.520 --> 41:08.680
..because only I can know...

41:10.080 --> 41:12.600
..how your centre

41:12.600 --> 41:14.720
couldn't hold.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.040
DOOR SLAMS SHUTS

41:30.040 --> 41:31.560
Tell me about Alice Munezero.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.880
There is a tale of a young prince,
weak and jealous...

41:39.160 --> 41:42.440
..who thought he would make a better
king than his older brother.

41:43.800 --> 41:49.240
So, one day, the old king gave his
sons a bundle of tied sticks

41:49.240 --> 41:52.320
and asked them to break it in half.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.240
But try as they might,
neither could.

41:55.240 --> 41:59.400
So then, the old king cut the cord
and handing out the sticks one

41:59.400 --> 42:04.320
by one, the princes found that they
could snap each, without effort.

42:04.320 --> 42:08.760
"This is the importance of unity,"
the old king told them.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.280
Whereupon the youngest prince,
holding the two halves of a broken

42:12.280 --> 42:17.000
stick plunged each into the heart of
his father and elder brother,

42:17.000 --> 42:18.880
killing them.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.200
And from then on,

42:20.200 --> 42:26.560
the young prince was free to rule
the kingdom alone and uncontested.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.880
For this story to work for
Alice Munezero,

42:29.880 --> 42:32.480
you need only change her gender.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.880
They're sisters?
Of experience, yes.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.440
But, only one knows how to truly
lead a nation - Bibi Mundanzi.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.880
Your president broke her
own promise to your country.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.720
She ran for a third term.

42:47.720 --> 42:52.000
And she was elected by 91%
of the electorate.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.280
And do you know why?

42:53.280 --> 42:56.120
Because everything she does
improves our country.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.960
It was unconstitutional.

42:59.960 --> 43:04.400
The constitution was changed by
95% of the electorate.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.360
And is that how you do things
in your country?

43:07.360 --> 43:09.520
If it doesn't work for you,
you just change the rules?

43:09.520 --> 43:10.960
HE LAUGHS

43:13.120 --> 43:18.200
I believe your country recently made
changes to fixed-term parliaments.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.040
It's what progressive
governments do.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.000
Yours is a dangerous precedent...
No.

43:23.240 --> 43:27.160
A tiny cartel of Western elites,
conspiring to manipulate

43:27.160 --> 43:30.440
international justice,
in an attempt to do what?

43:30.440 --> 43:32.720
What are your friends trying to do?
Who are my friends?

43:32.720 --> 43:33.880
Alice.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.160
Michael Ennis.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.200
Who else?

43:37.400 --> 43:40.920
Looking to destabilise one of the
most forward-thinking states

43:40.920 --> 43:43.800
in the entire African continent!

43:43.800 --> 43:48.040
That is a dangerous precedent!
And that needs to be stopped.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.080
Now.

43:56.680 --> 43:57.960
You know they're lovers.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.600
Then.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.640
And now.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.920
That's not possible.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.240
Except, it is.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.560
Everyone has been lying to you.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.520
Everyone.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.600
You have to help us.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.800
SCREEN UNLOCKS

45:30.120 --> 45:31.360
MOBILE PHONE MAKES CALL

45:33.880 --> 45:37.520
MAN: Hello?
Hi, my name's Kate Ashby.

45:37.520 --> 45:40.040
I believe you may know my mother,
Eve Ashby.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.080
Yeah.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.280
Sorry to hear what happened.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.760
Bad business.

45:45.760 --> 45:51.000
So the reason I'm calling is because
your number is on my mother's mobile
phone and I notice she called you

45:51.000 --> 45:54.080
a couple of days before she died.
Is that right?

45:54.080 --> 45:56.520
Yes. And I was just wondering if you
can remember

45:56.520 --> 45:58.000
what it was she called about.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.480
Oh, she,
she wanted to look at a file.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.800
File? What file?

46:06.800 --> 46:11.880
You and I would need to eye-ball
each other before I told you that.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.120
Why was she asking you for it?

46:14.120 --> 46:16.440
Because I'm the one who's got 'em.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.280
Sorry?

46:18.280 --> 46:20.280
In storage.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.480
You've got...
All the company files, yeah.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.400
Because?

46:25.400 --> 46:28.320
Because, I'm Mark Viner.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.680
I used to be her head of chambers
when she first started out.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.000
Hmm?
When I retired, I closed the firm.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.280
Your mother went on to join
that Ennis fella.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.280
When exactly was that?

46:41.280 --> 46:42.640
December '97.

46:42.640 --> 46:45.520
But up until that time
she was working...

46:45.520 --> 46:46.880
For me, yes.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.200
Sir, if I was to come out
to your house,

46:51.200 --> 46:53.560
would you allow me access
to that file?

46:53.560 --> 46:56.080
You'd have to have legal authority.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.000
I work for my mother's firm.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.760
Then I can't see why not.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.320
Would tonight be too late?

47:19.120 --> 47:20.160
HEAVY RAINFALL

47:38.760 --> 47:40.200
CAR ALARM SYSTEM CHIRPS

47:40.200 --> 47:41.240
THUNDER

47:57.200 --> 47:59.160
SHE GASPS

47:59.160 --> 48:01.720
Ms Ashby? My name is Daniel Drewe.
I'm a solicitor.

48:01.720 --> 48:05.000
No, sorry, I'm in a rush.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.440
Er, could you?

48:11.080 --> 48:13.800
My client requested
that I make contact with you.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.200
He would like to with meet you.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.320
Now, if that's at all possible.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.360
Who's your client?
Patrice Ganimana.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.280
I have a car waiting.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.480
To go where?

48:30.480 --> 48:31.640
Here, in London.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.200
I'll follow.

48:36.200 --> 48:39.960
Forgive me, but I believe you're
the one being followed?

48:39.960 --> 48:43.960
Which represents an unacceptable
risk to my client, again,

48:43.960 --> 48:45.120
on my advice.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.880
It depends on how much he
wants to see me.

48:49.880 --> 48:52.440
No, I'm afraid on this point,
Ms Ashby,

48:52.440 --> 48:56.600
it depends on how much you want to
hear what he has to say.

48:56.600 --> 48:57.960
The car's just over there.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.360
He, he's not in hospital?

49:27.360 --> 49:29.560
He's on rounds of chemotherapy.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.920
He's been freed?

49:33.920 --> 49:35.440
House arrest.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.720
In an embassy?
Friend's house.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.840
On an embassy street?

49:41.000 --> 49:42.160
It's a big house.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.040
Some friends.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.280
I will admit, I'm surprised.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.920
I said I didn't think you'd come.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.400
He said he knew you would.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.360
Please.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.280
Bonsoir.

52:43.760 --> 52:44.880
Je savais que vous...

52:54.720 --> 52:56.040
SHE STIFLES A SOB

53:00.280 --> 53:03.880
You fuck, fucked...

53:03.880 --> 53:05.400
Fucker, you fucker!

53:19.680 --> 53:21.320
HE CONTINUES IN FRENCH

53:46.560 --> 53:47.600
HE SIGHS HEAVILY

53:58.640 --> 53:59.680
Bien sur.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.440
Imbecile!

54:21.000 --> 54:22.120
Penser.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.160
And I did not kill your mother.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.880
You killed Simon Nyamoya?

54:52.880 --> 54:54.240
No.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.960
He was your enemy.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.040
Yes.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.440
You wanted him dead.

54:59.800 --> 55:01.400
Of course.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.480
But it wasn't me.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.800
Someone did it for you.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.720
I did not order it.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.880
It was not me.

55:08.880 --> 55:10.920
And I did not kill your mother.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.320
So?

55:27.440 --> 55:29.160
You want to put me in jail.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.920
Yes! Don't.

55:33.200 --> 55:36.400
You won't. No-one will.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.600
Why not?

55:39.600 --> 55:40.920
I'm already there.

55:42.960 --> 55:49.200
I spend every second of my life
living with what happened.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.440
With what you did?

55:50.440 --> 55:52.160
Every second.

55:52.160 --> 55:53.560
So you admit you're guilty.

55:54.920 --> 55:58.920
I was born at the wrong time,
on the wrong side.

55:58.920 --> 56:02.200
THAT is not what I said.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.960
And I have paid the price.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.520
No.

56:05.520 --> 56:06.920
No, no, no, no, you haven't.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.560
A million people paid the price!

56:11.840 --> 56:13.240
You just have to live with it!

56:13.240 --> 56:17.840
Nothing you could do to me could be
worse than what I already live with.

56:17.840 --> 56:18.880
Not enough.

56:20.040 --> 56:22.320
Nowhere...

56:22.320 --> 56:24.080
..near.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.320
Don't try to put me in jail.

56:26.320 --> 56:30.520
Oh, I'm going to try very,
very hard.

56:31.560 --> 56:33.160
They won't let you.

56:33.160 --> 56:34.400
Who's they?

56:34.400 --> 56:36.680
The people I'm trying to
save you from.

56:36.680 --> 56:40.280
The people who own this? Shouldn't
be too difficult to find out.

56:40.280 --> 56:44.520
Whoever you think owns this
is not who you should be afraid of.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.840
Then who should I be?

56:47.840 --> 56:49.160
They will kill you.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.480
They will kill anyone
who tries to stop them...

56:53.480 --> 56:54.640
From doing what?

56:59.200 --> 57:00.600
Repeating the past.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.280
That's weird, because killing was
so much a part of it!

57:12.160 --> 57:16.080
There, I have saved you.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.400
From what?

57:21.400 --> 57:23.000
Whether you like it or not.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.520
You have nothing on me.

57:24.520 --> 57:28.920
No, you are free
and I cannot follow.

57:30.360 --> 57:33.120
Next time I see you,
you'll be in the dock.

57:34.720 --> 57:39.400
If that should be,
then you won't ever see me again.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.720
God bless you, Kate Ashby.

57:43.800 --> 57:46.120
You still believe all that?

57:46.120 --> 57:48.000
Oh, yes.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.280
It is of Him I am most afraid.
