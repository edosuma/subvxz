00:28.294 --> 00:31.264
<i>[upbeat drumming]</i>

00:31.297 --> 00:33.266
- Please welcome
your hosts to our show,

00:33.299 --> 00:35.301
Olivia!

00:35.335 --> 00:39.472
[cheers and applause]

00:39.506 --> 00:42.776
Dylan, and Mykal-Michelle!

00:42.809 --> 00:45.845
[cheers and applause]

00:50.684 --> 00:52.652
- Welcome, everybody!
- Hi.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.221
- And keep it going
for Recker on the drums!

00:55.255 --> 00:57.023
- Yeah, oh, yeah!

00:57.057 --> 00:58.458
I'm Mykal-Michelle

00:58.491 --> 01:01.394
and this is my co-host, Dylan.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.396
- What's up, everybody?

01:03.430 --> 01:05.832
Tonight we have
a special monologue.

01:05.865 --> 01:09.069
It's the Mono-o-jog.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.405
Mykal-Michelle,
let's get jogging.

01:12.439 --> 01:17.077
- Well, my mom jogs,
my grandpa jogs, and I jog.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.278
You know,
guess you could say it

01:18.311 --> 01:21.748
runs in the family.
- Hey, good one.

01:21.781 --> 01:25.151
Scientists say jogging is
good for your heart, you know,

01:25.185 --> 01:27.887
which is good because it ain't
good for my sweat, man.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.123
I tell you that.

01:30.156 --> 01:35.128
- Let's jog fast.
Faster, faster, faster!

01:35.161 --> 01:37.430
You know, when I run fast,

01:37.464 --> 01:41.101
I imagine I'm being
chased by zombies.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.169
Eat my dust,
you brain-eating freaks!

01:43.203 --> 01:44.871
- Yeah, you freaks!

01:44.904 --> 01:46.773
We've got a great show
for you tonight.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.641
Come on, Mykal-Michelle.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.811
JoJo Siwa is here!
[cheers and applause]

01:51.845 --> 01:55.849
Race you to the desk.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.187
- Hi, everybody, I'm Olivia!

02:01.221 --> 02:04.257
And this is our desk button.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.327
Today's button says,

02:07.360 --> 02:09.629
"Push for lovely song."

02:09.662 --> 02:11.865
Will do, button.

02:11.898 --> 02:12.932
<i>[burp noise]</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:14.367
Ugh!

02:14.401 --> 02:17.203
- Ew!
- Oh, man, that's disgusting.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.440
It's a burp, not a song.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.442
- Smells like sardines.
- Wait, let me--

02:22.475 --> 02:24.511
let me hear it again.

02:24.544 --> 02:27.514
<i>[burp noise]</i>

02:27.547 --> 02:30.417
Hey, that's sorta
growing on me.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.888
<i>[burp noise]</i>

02:36.256 --> 02:37.657
You know what?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.693
That is a lovely song.

02:39.726 --> 02:43.129
- You might need to get
those ears checked.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.366
- I have to tell
you guys about Mayhem.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.501
It's a 30-second dance party

02:48.535 --> 02:51.504
that's launched by a different
secret passcode each night.

02:51.538 --> 02:54.274
- Yeah, we never
get to know what it is,

02:54.307 --> 02:56.776
but you in the audience
and at home do.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.313
Tonight's secret
Mayhem passcode is...

03:02.482 --> 03:05.185
- Keep an ear out
for that Mayhem passcode.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.053
- [laughs]

03:07.087 --> 03:08.321
Wait a second.

03:08.355 --> 03:12.459
You guys, I just realized
we have a big problem.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.227
- What is it, Olivia?

03:14.260 --> 03:17.130
- We've never shown the viewers
pictures of our pets.

03:17.163 --> 03:19.799
- Oh.
- That is--

03:19.833 --> 03:21.067
- That's a huge problem.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.736
- I know.
- Yeah.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.072
- Well, we're gonna
fix that tonight.

03:26.072 --> 03:29.509
Check out this picture
of my adorable cat, Twinkle.

03:29.542 --> 03:33.179
- Aw.
- Oh, so cute.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.083
Well, take a look at
my adorable dog, Bagel.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.785
- Aw, so cute.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.086
- Oh, I have a dog, too.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.689
His name Young Dylan Jr.

03:42.722 --> 03:46.593
- [laughs]
- Okay?

03:46.626 --> 03:48.428
- Hey, Recker,
do you have any pets?

03:48.461 --> 03:51.097
- Sure do, check out my horse.
It has my hair.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.366
<i>[horse neighs]</i>
- Oh, wow.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.869
- Whoa, it does have your hair.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.338
- It sure does.
Check out my other horse.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.040
<i>[horse snorts]</i>

04:00.073 --> 04:02.342
- Wow.
- And this horse.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.778
<i>[cow moos]</i>
- Oh, uh...

04:04.811 --> 04:06.446
sorry to break it to you,
Recker,

04:06.479 --> 04:07.681
but that's a cow.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.349
- Pretty sure
it's a horse, Olivia,

04:09.382 --> 04:11.284
but check out my other horse.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.053
<i>[alpaca squeals]</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:15.321
- Yo, Recker, that's an alpaca.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.058
- Man, you guys really
gotta learn your horses.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.859
Whoo.
Here's my other horse though.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.861
<i>[dog barks]</i>

04:21.895 --> 04:26.566
- Recker, do you know
what a horse is?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.201
- Yeah, I do.
But this has been

04:28.234 --> 04:29.569
"Horses with Recker's Hair."

04:29.602 --> 04:32.238
Back to you, Olivia.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.240
- Well, when we come back,

04:34.274 --> 04:38.411
we've got JoJo Siwa!

04:38.445 --> 04:42.716
And I'm so, so excited.
Stick around.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.785
[cheers and applause]

04:50.957 --> 04:53.927
[upbeat music]

04:53.960 --> 04:57.931
* *

04:57.964 --> 05:02.635
- Welcome back to
the "Kids Tonight Show."

05:02.669 --> 05:05.939
Our guest tonight is
a super awesome dancer,

05:06.039 --> 05:09.075
actor, and a mega pop star,

05:09.109 --> 05:11.745
and the star
of the movie musical,

05:11.778 --> 05:13.380
"The J Team."

05:13.413 --> 05:16.116
Please welcome JoJo Siwa!

05:16.149 --> 05:20.420
[cheers and applause]

05:20.453 --> 05:21.521
- Whoa.

05:21.554 --> 05:27.660
- Whoa, awesome!

05:27.694 --> 05:29.229
- Okay, okay.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.364
We got this one
for Mykal-Michelle.

05:31.398 --> 05:34.567
This one for Dylan.
- Appreciate it, appreciate it.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.302
- Let's put that on.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.338
- What is up, JoJo?

05:38.371 --> 05:41.141
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.509
- How is it going?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.377
- Well, I love
your outfit right now.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.612
- Thank you.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.580
- Yeah, that's like
the best jacket ever.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.583
I love the--it has like
the rainbow sparkles

05:50.617 --> 05:53.453
with the--with the gems,
the glams.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.288
- Got it all over.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.624
It actually--
it says my name on the back.

05:57.657 --> 06:01.728
Can you see that?
- Whoa!

06:01.761 --> 06:04.397
- Also your hair!
Love those colors.

06:04.431 --> 06:07.033
- Yeah!
- Thank you, I got the rainbow.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.837
- I always wear like--
like really cool pins

06:10.870 --> 06:14.708
in my hair, so that is awesome.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.677
- So, JoJo, do you have
any secret talents

06:17.711 --> 06:20.680
that no one knows.
- Hmm.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.383
- Oh, boy, I do, I do.

06:23.416 --> 06:27.053
And I haven't talked about it
in a few years now,

06:27.053 --> 06:30.290
but I actually can fart
with nine parts of my body.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.158
- Wait, huh?
- What?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.560
- I can fart with my ear,

06:33.593 --> 06:35.562
I can fart with my shoulder,

06:35.595 --> 06:36.763
I can fart with my neck,

06:36.796 --> 06:38.331
I can fart with my chest--

06:38.365 --> 06:39.599
- Your neck?

06:39.632 --> 06:40.800
What is happening?

06:40.834 --> 06:44.671
- Can we have
a demonstration please?

06:44.704 --> 06:45.972
- Why not? Let's see.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.575
Let's see if my neck's
gonna want to fart today.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.643
All right, are you ready?

06:50.677 --> 06:52.312
[farting noise]

06:52.345 --> 06:55.348
- Oh!
- Ooh!

06:55.382 --> 06:57.083
[cheers and applause]

06:57.117 --> 07:00.286
- So, is all that candy
in your house real?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.855
- All of it is real.
- Wow.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.323
- Is that candy
behind you guys?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.558
Is that candy real,
your skyline?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.027
- It is.
- Yes.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.561
- It is real.
- Yeah, but we can't eat it.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.364
'Cause if we eat it,
we get sick.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.901
- I wish--I wish I could just
open my mouth up like super big

07:14.934 --> 07:18.271
and just run
all across all the shelves

07:18.304 --> 07:20.373
and just all--
it all come into my mouth.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.941
- I think that'd be
a pretty good idea.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.044
- What makes you the happiest?

07:24.044 --> 07:28.381
- I think what makes me
the happiest is performing.

07:28.415 --> 07:32.185
I love to perform,
it's my favorite thing ever.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.954
My family makes me super happy.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.623
My girlfriend
makes me super happy.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.092
My friends make me super happy.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.062
All my people around me
make me super happy.

07:42.062 --> 07:46.066
- So what happened this year
that you're the most proud of?

07:46.066 --> 07:49.069
- Whoa, that's a--
that's a scary question.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.904
I think what I'm most proud of

07:50.937 --> 07:52.572
is that this year,
more than ever,

07:52.605 --> 07:54.407
I've been myself.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.543
And I've been happy,

07:56.576 --> 07:58.311
and I've showed the world
this side of me

07:58.345 --> 08:00.013
and I think that's really cool.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.781
What about you?
What are you most proud of

08:01.815 --> 08:03.717
this year that you did?
- Um, honestly,

08:03.750 --> 08:05.452
I've never been
a talk show host.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.920
That's pretty awesome.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.456
- Same.
- Yeah, that's awesome.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.224
- You're a cool drummer too.

08:11.257 --> 08:14.594
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.662
- Another question.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.231
If you had to change
your hairstyle--

08:18.264 --> 08:20.867
I love it right now,
but if you had to,

08:20.900 --> 08:22.302
what would you pick?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.837
- Mm.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.038
- Oh, boy.

08:25.071 --> 08:29.175
Well, I got some options.
- [chuckles]

08:29.209 --> 08:32.445
Oh.
- Ooh.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.583
All right,
this is good, this is good.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.085
A bob, I like it, I'm into it.

08:40.887 --> 08:42.155
- Whoa!

08:42.188 --> 08:45.125
- Oh, I call this one
the George Washington.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.593
[laughter]

08:46.626 --> 08:47.827
- Oh, whoa.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.364
- Oh, most definitely.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.166
- You could definitely
rock that.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.634
- I think the rainbow.

08:54.668 --> 08:59.172
- Okay, you're going on
"Dancing with the Stars."

08:59.205 --> 09:00.907
That is amazing.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.009
[cheers and applause]

09:03.043 --> 09:05.712
Why was it so important
for you to do

09:05.745 --> 09:08.481
[hiccups]
"Dancing With the Stars?"

09:08.515 --> 09:10.016
- You're so cute.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.419
Got a little--
got a little hiccup?

09:12.452 --> 09:13.753
- Yep.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.189
- I'm most looking forward to

09:16.222 --> 09:17.390
getting to dance with a girl.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.893
I think that's super cool
and super special.

09:19.926 --> 09:23.229
And I'm also just looking
forward to getting to dance.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.031
I love to dance
and I think it's gonna be

09:25.031 --> 09:26.900
so fun and so challenging

09:26.933 --> 09:28.635
'cause I haven't
done it in so long,

09:28.668 --> 09:30.070
but it's gonna be a blast.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.505
[cheers and applause]

09:32.539 --> 09:36.276
- So your movie, "The J Team,"
is all about being yourself.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.179
How can us kids just do that?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.348
- Well, I'm not gonna lie.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.383
Sometimes,
as crazy as it sounds,

09:43.416 --> 09:46.052
it can be tricky
to be yourself.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.956
But I like to remember
why I like to be myself.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.792
What makes me different
than everybody in the world,

09:52.826 --> 09:53.927
if that makes sense.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.929
And I think the best way

09:55.962 --> 09:58.064
to keep being yourself
is to remember

09:58.064 --> 10:00.867
what makes you special.

10:00.900 --> 10:04.204
- So what was the biggest
performance have you had?

10:04.237 --> 10:07.607
'Cause like mine's was
probably like NBA All-Star,

10:07.640 --> 10:09.876
but like yours is probably
way bigger than that.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.712
- I think my favorite
performance I've done

10:12.746 --> 10:14.647
and my biggest performance is--

10:14.681 --> 10:17.717
there's an arena in London
called the O2 arena.

10:17.751 --> 10:22.055
And it's like most famous
arena in the UK.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.256
- Were you nervous?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.225
Because like
when I'm about to perform,

10:25.258 --> 10:27.193
like I'll do a special
handshake with my dad.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.529
Like I just did it
before we went on the show.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.732
But like, what did you do
to like help the nerves?

10:32.766 --> 10:35.669
'Cause like you're in London
around all these people.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.804
- I was about your guys' age.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.873
I was 11 on--

10:39.906 --> 10:42.108
when I first started
on "Dance Moms."

10:42.142 --> 10:45.145
And then when I was 13,
I left "Dance Moms."

10:45.178 --> 10:47.547
And I remember
the day that I left,

10:47.580 --> 10:49.883
I kind of had
a crazy flashback.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.151
And I was like, "Oh, my gosh,"

10:51.184 --> 10:53.386
because I was so nervous
all the time,

10:53.420 --> 10:56.222
I missed out on
having so much fun.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.191
So after that,
I told myself, I said,

10:58.224 --> 11:01.895
"No matter what,
for every single project I do,

11:01.928 --> 11:04.064
I'm never allowed
to be nervous again."

11:04.097 --> 11:07.133
And since then,
the last five years of my life,

11:07.167 --> 11:11.771
I've never been nervous for
anything involving my career.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.074
[cheers and applause]

11:14.074 --> 11:16.076
- Are you excited
for your new show,

11:16.109 --> 11:19.079
"Siwa's Dance Pop Revolution?"

11:19.112 --> 11:23.083
And what advice do you have
for the contestants?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.185
- I am super excited.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.854
And my advice
for the contestants is

11:27.887 --> 11:31.558
"Go full out, be yourself, and
just have fun

11:31.591 --> 11:34.594
and enjoy the ride."
- Awesome.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.896
- JoJo, that was awesome!

11:36.930 --> 11:39.299
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.600
- When we come back,

11:40.633 --> 11:42.569
we're gonna play a game
with JoJo.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.838
And I'm going to send
that remote controlled car

11:44.871 --> 11:46.172
to get us a pizza.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.108
We'll be right back!

12:47.233 --> 12:52.706
in a mini challenge

12:52.739 --> 12:55.342
- Let's do it!
- Each of you have 20 seconds

12:55.375 --> 12:58.244
to stack your cup tower
as high as you can.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.547
Whoever has
the tallest tower wins.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.082

13:02.115 --> 13:04.084

Are you kidding?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.572
<i>- Look at her go!</i>

13:25.605 --> 13:27.240

- No!

13:29.843 --> 13:31.544

13:33.179 --> 13:35.849
- No!
- Time to count them up.

13:35.882 --> 13:42.422
Looks like JoJo's tower
is, uh, five cups?

13:42.455 --> 13:44.657
And Recker's tower is...

13:44.691 --> 13:46.626
three, four, five, six, seven.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.598

- All righty.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.900
- I was up there,
but my mine came

13:53.933 --> 13:56.569
tumbling down just like that.

13:56.603 --> 14:00.373
- Congratulations, Recker.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.641
All righty.
