LOUIE (over radio):
   Hey, Reiger, what are you
         gonna be doing

01:19.378 --> 01:21.046
on this miserable cold night

01:21.080 --> 01:23.748
while I'm cuddling
    with my girlfriend Zena,

01:23.783 --> 01:26.718
sipping wine and watching
   the Miss Universe pageant?

01:26.752 --> 01:28.619
I'll be driving, Lou.

01:28.654 --> 01:29.787
Close.

01:29.822 --> 01:31.089
You'll be driving an old woman

01:31.123 --> 01:32.523
and a sick husky to the vet.

01:32.558 --> 01:33.825
Hudson and Jane Street.

01:33.859 --> 01:34.992
Thank you, Lou.

01:35.027 --> 01:36.227
So long, Reiger.

01:36.261 --> 01:38.396
Mush, mush!

01:38.430 --> 01:40.364
Over and out.

01:46.004 --> 01:47.939
Hi, Zena.

01:52.945 --> 01:55.313
(woman sobbing loudly)
   What's that?

01:55.348 --> 01:57.148
It's Emily; she's
                in the bathroom.

01:57.182 --> 01:59.551
Oh, no! I thought you said
you were gonna get rid of her!

01:59.585 --> 02:01.419
I want to watch
Miss Universe.

02:01.421 --> 02:04.722
I'm sorry, but Emily is very
        upset, and she needs me.

02:04.757 --> 02:05.756
Oh...

02:05.791 --> 02:07.826
Oh, try and understand.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.629
She's been living with this
  guy, Adam, for three years,

02:11.663 --> 02:14.532
supporting him so he could
       finish art school.

02:14.566 --> 02:17.869
The day he graduates,
   he tells her he's leaving

02:17.903 --> 02:20.071
to marry another woman!

02:20.105 --> 02:21.873
That's it?

02:21.907 --> 02:22.840
Oh...

02:22.875 --> 02:24.108
(groans)

02:24.142 --> 02:25.610
Louie, be a sport!
                        Come on!

02:25.644 --> 02:27.412
(Emily crying)

02:27.446 --> 02:30.048
(sniffling)
             Zena,

02:30.082 --> 02:33.018
I feel terrible inflicting
    myself on you like this.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.319
Maybe I should go.

02:37.689 --> 02:40.291
No, no, no, no, absolutely not.

02:40.325 --> 02:42.393
Just come on and sit down, okay?

02:42.427 --> 02:46.164
Emily, this is my
               boyfriend, Louie.

02:46.198 --> 02:47.665
Yeah, yeah, tough break.

02:51.603 --> 02:53.938
(sobbing)

02:53.972 --> 02:58.476
(still crying)
                    (TV playing)

02:58.511 --> 03:03.114
I just keep asking myself,
      "Is it really over?"

03:03.148 --> 03:06.351
I just can't believe it.

03:06.385 --> 03:08.119
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

03:08.153 --> 03:09.654
What am I gonna do?

03:09.688 --> 03:12.189
What? What?
            Shh!

03:12.224 --> 03:13.391
ZENA:
                          Louis!

03:13.426 --> 03:15.360
I said, "Shh," not shut up.

03:15.394 --> 03:18.062
I really should leave.

03:19.131 --> 03:21.700
Emily, please stop that.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.703
Hey, hey, hey, how
             about a drink, huh?

03:24.737 --> 03:26.337
No, I probably
shouldn't drink.

03:26.371 --> 03:28.773
I'm taking some medication.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.275
What are you taking?

03:30.309 --> 03:33.078
I got a mild sedative
from my doctor and, uh,

03:33.112 --> 03:35.614
and one from my mother.

03:35.648 --> 03:38.617
And, oh, yeah,
the super gave me one.

03:38.651 --> 03:41.385
I just had to have something
  to help me get through this.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.387
(wailing)

03:43.422 --> 03:45.090
What is that?!

03:45.124 --> 03:47.091
(grumbling)

03:47.125 --> 03:50.095
Louie, would you please
       mind opening up the wine?

03:50.129 --> 03:51.429
I'd like some.

03:51.463 --> 03:53.397
(groaning)

03:53.432 --> 03:55.466
(grumbling)

03:57.703 --> 04:00.771
Sure you don't want something
  to wash down the goofballs?

04:03.442 --> 04:04.575
Yeah.

04:04.610 --> 04:06.043
Yeah, why not?

04:06.077 --> 04:08.513
I'm going for numb.

04:08.547 --> 04:11.882
Here, numb up,
               numb up, numb up.

04:12.951 --> 04:15.219
Thanks.
                        Mm-hmm.

04:17.755 --> 04:20.058
I know what my problem is.

04:20.091 --> 04:23.661
I let him know just
     how much I loved him.

04:23.695 --> 04:25.129
You see, Louie,

04:25.164 --> 04:27.698
I don't hold
anything back

04:27.732 --> 04:30.000
and so, I don't
have anything left.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.241
TV ANNOUNCER:
         And now a word
      from our sponsor...

04:36.275 --> 04:38.943
You know, Emily, I don't
think that's your problem.

04:38.977 --> 04:41.146
Louie, you hardly
                even know Emily.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.147
I don't think she
              wants your advice.

04:43.182 --> 04:44.615
No, I'm curious.

04:44.649 --> 04:46.651
I'd like to hear
an impartial opinion.

04:46.685 --> 04:50.088
Well, I'd like to get this in
before the commercial's over.

04:50.122 --> 04:52.256
Uh, look, Emily,

04:52.290 --> 04:54.259
uh, did either of your
parents drink a lot?

04:54.293 --> 04:55.894
My father.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.294
That's it!

04:57.329 --> 04:59.630
He was unstable
and unpredictable,

04:59.664 --> 05:01.833
but there was a kind of
excitement about that.

05:01.867 --> 05:04.769
Now you're seeking out
that excitement in a man.

05:04.803 --> 05:07.572
You look for that craziness,
and it blows up in your face.

05:07.606 --> 05:10.375
I'm missing the swimsuits.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.980
Do you realize what
       that man just did?

05:16.015 --> 05:18.917
He summed up my entire life.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.785
Why are you always
     apologizing about him?

05:26.225 --> 05:31.428
There are moments when
           I'm proud of the lug.

05:31.463 --> 05:33.531
Thank you.

05:33.565 --> 05:34.965
(grunting)

05:37.002 --> 05:38.770
Well, I gotta go.

05:38.804 --> 05:40.238
ZENA:
            Oh, no, Emily, stay.

05:40.272 --> 05:41.906
EMILY:
             No, no, I feel like

05:41.941 --> 05:44.609
I'm imposing, and...
                    and besides,

05:44.643 --> 05:46.877
I'm a lot better now.
         I'll be fine.

05:46.912 --> 05:48.646
Are you sure?
                         Mm-hmm.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.448
I just want to go
            freshen up a little.

05:50.482 --> 05:53.785
Not that it'll
       ever matter again.

05:53.819 --> 05:55.120
(sobbing)

05:55.154 --> 05:57.922
(silent cheers)

06:00.292 --> 06:02.493
Louie, we can't let
               her go like that.

06:02.527 --> 06:04.829
Why? It's good for
her she's leaving.

06:04.863 --> 06:07.231
After being dumped,
    seeing the catch you got

06:07.266 --> 06:09.367
is like rubbing
      salt in the wounds.

06:12.838 --> 06:16.007
Look, would you mind calling
       one of your cabs for her?

06:16.041 --> 06:17.809
I can't let her walk home.

06:17.843 --> 06:20.111
Oh, give me the phone,
give me the phone.

06:21.146 --> 06:22.480
(Emily sobbing)

06:22.514 --> 06:24.449
Ooh!

06:24.483 --> 06:26.951
I hate to just
               put her in a cab.

06:26.985 --> 06:30.287
I know it's asking a lot,

06:30.322 --> 06:32.090
but would you go
                 along with her?

06:32.124 --> 06:34.926
Oh, no, Zena, I can't--
I don't want to do that!

06:34.960 --> 06:39.563
Miss Barbados is gonna
play the French horn.

06:41.299 --> 06:43.935
Please?

06:43.969 --> 06:46.537
(mumbling):
Yeah...

06:56.548 --> 06:58.248
LOUIE:
All right, all right.

06:58.283 --> 07:00.952
Oh! Reiger,
they sent you.

07:00.986 --> 07:03.420
Yeah.

07:03.455 --> 07:06.858
Take us to 324
Christopher Street, Driver.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.092
(chuckles)

07:08.126 --> 07:10.962
Always glad to do a
             favor for a friend.

07:10.996 --> 07:12.797
You piece of dirt.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.069
Emily, I'd like you
to meet Alex Reiger.

07:18.103 --> 07:22.306
Alex, this bit of emotional
wreckage is Emily,

07:22.341 --> 07:24.742
a good friend of
Zena's and mine.

07:24.776 --> 07:27.979
Take it easy on her;
      she just got dumped.

07:28.013 --> 07:29.747
Nice to meet you, Alex.

07:29.781 --> 07:31.950
Yeah, hi there.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.953
He reminds me of Adam,

07:34.987 --> 07:40.658
the same Semitic coloring.

07:40.692 --> 07:43.360
Adam even had one of
      those flannel shirts

07:43.395 --> 07:45.596
when they were in style.
                        Hey.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.032
Hey, lady, come on,
      what'd I do to you?

07:48.066 --> 07:51.269
It's okay, Reiger,
     she's scrambled eggs.

07:51.303 --> 07:55.239
Look, Emily, you gotta stop
thinking about this guy.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.842
You're right, I've got to
    stop thinking about him.

07:57.876 --> 07:59.476
And I'm not gonna
       be able to do that

07:59.511 --> 08:01.445
as long as I've got things
     that remind me of him.

08:01.479 --> 08:05.049
Look, Adam and me at Tanglewood.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.985
Step on it,
will you, Reiger?

08:08.019 --> 08:11.389
Adam and me at my
       sister's wedding.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.391
(crying):
             Adam.

08:13.425 --> 08:15.058
And look, I'm carrying
       his love letters.

08:15.093 --> 08:17.662
Can you believe I still
    carry his love letters?

08:17.696 --> 08:21.599
You know, you got an
             ashtray back there.

08:21.633 --> 08:22.767
Hostile!

08:22.801 --> 08:25.369
Hostile, just like Adam.

08:25.403 --> 08:26.771
Oh, I...

08:26.805 --> 08:29.173
There I go again, I'm sorry.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.608
Do you have a handkerchief?

08:30.642 --> 08:33.010
Not one big enough for you.

08:33.044 --> 08:34.945
(sobbing)

08:34.980 --> 08:36.046
Now, now, lady,

08:36.081 --> 08:37.847
this is it, Reiger,
this is it.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.049
All right, that's good.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.217
Let it all out.

08:40.251 --> 08:42.919
Have yourself a good cry,
but do it outside.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.455
You're on the meter in here.

08:44.489 --> 08:46.257
Come on.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.925
Oh, wait a minute.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.795
That's a pretty dark building
    you're going into there.

08:50.829 --> 08:54.098
Look at all the scuzzos
           out front.

08:54.132 --> 08:56.100
Um... when you get
to your apartment,

08:56.134 --> 08:59.003
flick the lights on and off
so we know you're okay.

08:59.037 --> 09:00.504
Go on, get out.

09:00.538 --> 09:02.907
Louie, Louie, walk her up.

09:02.941 --> 09:04.141
What?
                    Walk her up.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.509
Look, I'm not
walking her...
                    Walk her up.

09:05.543 --> 09:06.844
No, I don't want to!
                    Walk her up!

09:06.878 --> 09:08.813
Walk her, walk her!
I don't want to!

09:08.847 --> 09:11.583
What are we,
  Knights of the Round Table?

09:11.617 --> 09:12.817
Walk her!

09:12.851 --> 09:14.051
All right, I'll walk her,

09:14.085 --> 09:15.719
but you wait for me, Reiger.

09:15.754 --> 09:19.223
This is the worst
Miss Universe night
I ever spent.

09:19.257 --> 09:22.059
Hang on, screwball!

09:23.662 --> 09:26.230
(door unlocking)

09:26.265 --> 09:28.699
LOUIE: Yeah, yeah,
there you are.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.405
Here you are, home
                 safe and sound.

09:34.439 --> 09:36.407
Oh, here, here.

09:36.441 --> 09:38.276
Thanks a lot, Louie.
           All right, all right.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.744
I really appreciate
the lift and, you know,

09:40.779 --> 09:42.012
you walking me up
and everything.

09:42.047 --> 09:43.847
Yeah, all right.

09:43.882 --> 09:45.816
I hate being this needy.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.885
It's okay.

09:47.919 --> 09:49.687
We all make asses
                   of ourselves.

09:49.721 --> 09:51.856
(laughing)

09:51.890 --> 09:53.824
(chuckling)

09:53.858 --> 09:55.159
Yeah, made you smile, huh?

09:55.193 --> 09:56.627
(sighing)

09:56.661 --> 09:57.995
You're a real friend.

09:58.029 --> 10:00.064
Yeah, well, okay,
                     good night.

10:00.098 --> 10:02.633
And you're a lovely man.

10:05.003 --> 10:06.871
Huh?

10:06.905 --> 10:10.841
I don't know what wonderful
  thing you're gonna say next.

10:18.183 --> 10:19.684
Well...

10:21.619 --> 10:24.455
Well, I'll tell ya,

10:24.489 --> 10:26.357
uh, you know what
       a real friend is?

10:26.391 --> 10:29.494
Uh...

10:29.528 --> 10:34.699
Well, frankly, I don't know
      very many quotes, but, uh,

10:34.733 --> 10:38.736
I think perhaps Mark Twain
       put it best when he said,

10:38.770 --> 10:43.908
"A friend is somebody who,
         who laughs at our jokes

10:43.942 --> 10:46.711
when they're not so good

10:46.745 --> 10:49.580
and who sympathizes
               with our troubles

10:49.615 --> 10:52.683
when they're not so bad."

10:54.619 --> 10:59.590
Mark Twain was the most
 brilliant man who ever lived.

10:59.624 --> 11:03.260
Yeah, but who slipped it
          into the conversation?

11:03.295 --> 11:07.665
Well, thanks again.

11:07.699 --> 11:09.066
Yeah.
    Good night.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.001
Good night,
                    good night.

11:23.548 --> 11:27.118
My mouth always opens
                   a little bit.

11:27.152 --> 11:29.120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:29.154 --> 11:31.422
You know what I'm gonna
      say next, don't you?

11:31.456 --> 11:33.657
Yeah, get the hell
                    out of here.
I don't want to be alone.

11:33.691 --> 11:35.359
Get the hell out of here?
     You don't want to be alone?

11:35.393 --> 11:37.694
I don't want to be alone.
       Get the hell out of here.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.240
Okay, Reiger, how
       much do I owe you?

11:49.274 --> 11:50.441
Oh, yeah.

11:50.475 --> 11:53.044
How long did you wait
     before you figured out

11:53.078 --> 11:57.281
that Louie De Palma was
  gonna score with that girl?

11:57.315 --> 11:58.349
An hour.

11:58.383 --> 12:00.251
It took me that
                 long to realize

12:00.285 --> 12:02.486
that you could do something
               that low to Zena.

12:04.522 --> 12:06.390
Louie, I'm appalled.

12:06.424 --> 12:09.260
You made Alex wait a whole
   hour outside the building?

12:09.294 --> 12:12.029
Tony, you don't know
      what you're saying.

12:12.063 --> 12:13.898
Shoot, every time I try
      to use a fancy word,

12:13.932 --> 12:15.700
I screw it up.
No.

12:15.734 --> 12:16.901
Tony, the word is right.

12:16.935 --> 12:18.669
But the point is,
he spent the night

12:18.704 --> 12:20.270
with Zena's best friend.

12:20.305 --> 12:22.907
Louie... I'm candid.

12:26.144 --> 12:27.845
You'll want to hear this.

12:27.879 --> 12:30.314
There she was,

12:30.348 --> 12:34.318
dejected, desperate and stoned.

12:34.352 --> 12:36.887
Everything I could
      hope for in a woman.

12:38.556 --> 12:40.591
And we went for each other.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.727
And now,
        I have two. <i>Two.</i>

12:43.761 --> 12:45.629
I have <i>two</i> women.

12:45.663 --> 12:49.534
Look, <i>two</i> phone numbers. Hmm?

12:49.568 --> 12:52.370
<i>Two.</i>

12:52.404 --> 12:56.040
For this guy, I don't mind
    tellin' ya, it's a dream

12:56.074 --> 12:57.775
come true.
    Oh, boy...

12:57.809 --> 12:59.944
I'm tellin' ya, I never thought
        it would happen.

12:59.978 --> 13:01.645
Don't give up
    on your dreams, Reiger.

13:01.679 --> 13:03.381
I hung in there.

13:03.415 --> 13:04.649
I persevered.

13:04.683 --> 13:08.752
And now, I stand humble
      in the promised land

13:08.787 --> 13:10.588
with a babe on each arm.

13:10.622 --> 13:11.922
(chuckles)

13:11.956 --> 13:13.524
Gather 'round me, boys.

13:13.559 --> 13:15.326
Let me give you some advice.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.094
Take notes if you wish.

13:17.128 --> 13:18.762
(laughs)

13:18.797 --> 13:20.598
Follow those dreams.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.099
Chase those rainbows.

13:22.133 --> 13:28.239
Climb every mountain
   and ye shall be rewarded.

13:28.273 --> 13:30.741
"Ye"? What's with him?

13:30.775 --> 13:33.310
Uh-uh-uh, this is guy talk,
           guy talk.

13:33.345 --> 13:36.681
Nobody tell Nardo anything
     or you'll set her off.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.315
Tell Nardo what?

13:38.349 --> 13:40.484
Louie's been having a fling
with Zena's best friend.

13:40.518 --> 13:41.686
(muttering)

13:41.720 --> 13:43.688
Oh, Louie...

13:43.722 --> 13:45.790
Ye really are slime.

13:46.991 --> 13:49.193
Take it easy now, Nardo.
                             No!

13:49.227 --> 13:50.794
Take...
             You know something?

13:50.828 --> 13:52.597
I'm glad you're gonna lose Zena.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.132
I'm glad.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.801
How will I lose her?

13:56.835 --> 13:58.135
Because sooner or later,

13:58.169 --> 14:00.738
someone won't be able
    to stomach what you did,

14:00.772 --> 14:03.440
and they're gonna tell her.

14:03.474 --> 14:07.445
Nobody is gonna tell
         Zena anything.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.246
Oh, no? Why not?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.483
Because it would hurt her.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.552
Neh!

14:16.120 --> 14:18.121
But you know someone
                  will tell her,

14:18.156 --> 14:21.259
because they like Zena,
        and they don't like you.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.294
And even though it's
        gonna hurt her at first,

14:23.328 --> 14:24.595
eventually she'll
                    get over it.

14:24.629 --> 14:26.530
And it'll make her
        get rid of you.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.566
And that's the best thing
 that could ever happen to her.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.435
Neh!

14:37.642 --> 14:39.276
She's right.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.244
She's right.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.581
It'll get out.

14:44.983 --> 14:48.786
It's impossible to keep
the lid on something like this.

14:48.820 --> 14:51.421
I gotta tell her--
tell her myself.

14:51.456 --> 14:54.658
She loves me,
and she'll forgive me.

14:54.692 --> 14:56.393
Thanks a lot, Jim.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.463
Hey, uh, boss?

14:59.498 --> 15:03.401
About those inspiring words

15:03.435 --> 15:08.005
you made
a few moments ago,

15:08.039 --> 15:10.908
I didn't get a few of the words
          at the end.

15:10.942 --> 15:15.512
What comes after,
"Follow those dreams,

15:15.547 --> 15:18.014
chase those rainbows..."?

15:18.049 --> 15:19.983
Suck rope, bean brain.

15:21.252 --> 15:24.855
"Suck rope, bean brain."

15:26.291 --> 15:29.259
Well, it fizzles out
   a little there at the end,

15:29.294 --> 15:32.897
but it's a timeless message
            anyway.

15:36.134 --> 15:37.701
Hi, Zena.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.004
Louie, what happened last night?

15:40.072 --> 15:41.571
I was so worried.
Uh...

15:41.606 --> 15:43.407
Look, there's something
        I gotta tell ya.

15:43.441 --> 15:45.409
This isn't easy.

15:45.443 --> 15:47.611
But to be as gentle
          as possible,

15:47.645 --> 15:50.714
last night,
    your girlfriend and I...

15:50.749 --> 15:52.850
we took a hammock ride.

15:52.884 --> 15:54.585
(gasps)

15:54.619 --> 15:56.086
Oh, God!

15:56.120 --> 15:57.888
Now, don't blame yourself.

16:01.693 --> 16:05.128
Emily! How could she?

16:05.163 --> 16:09.033
I can never be friends
        with her again.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.201
That's for sure.

16:11.235 --> 16:14.438
I must say, I lost a lot
of respect for her myself.

16:16.908 --> 16:18.542
And you!

16:18.576 --> 16:19.877
Get out of here!

16:19.911 --> 16:21.445
I don't want
       to see you again.

16:21.479 --> 16:23.280
I don't want to know you exist!

16:23.315 --> 16:26.984
Me? You're getting mad at me,
          the victim?

16:27.018 --> 16:29.586
"Victim," what are you
         talking about?

16:29.621 --> 16:31.421
You don't know that woman, Zena.

16:31.455 --> 16:33.423
She's a temptress.

16:33.457 --> 16:35.525
I didn't know what hit me.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.367
Maybe you were a victim.

16:44.969 --> 16:46.637
You're a weak man
         who hasn't had

16:46.671 --> 16:48.605
much pleasure
in his life.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.740
Yeah, you're right.

16:49.774 --> 16:52.175
I was a victim.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.078
Thanks for understanding.

16:56.281 --> 16:59.249
And besides, how long
                  can this thing

16:59.283 --> 17:01.751
between me and Emily
                   go on anyway?

17:01.786 --> 17:03.353
"Go on"?

17:03.387 --> 17:05.321
You want to continue?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.957
Yeah.

17:06.991 --> 17:09.192
Get your stuff and get out

17:09.227 --> 17:10.527
of here right now!

17:10.561 --> 17:12.963
Well, what'd I say?
We were doing so good.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.833
Don't say another word!

17:15.867 --> 17:17.501
Twist things!

17:17.535 --> 17:18.568
You lie!

17:18.603 --> 17:20.171
You're a user, Lou!

17:20.204 --> 17:21.637
You take

17:21.673 --> 17:23.941
and you take and you take
             and you never give!

17:23.974 --> 17:25.342
Don't call me!
                 Don't write me!

17:25.376 --> 17:26.410
Forget where I live!

17:26.444 --> 17:28.645
I don't want see you again!

17:28.679 --> 17:31.381
You're selfish
           and you're miserable!

17:31.415 --> 17:35.085
Zena, do you want those
      to be the last words

17:35.119 --> 17:36.853
we ever say to each other?

17:36.888 --> 17:37.955
No.

17:37.989 --> 17:39.322
You're garbage!

17:45.129 --> 17:46.597
(knocking)

17:46.631 --> 17:48.566
LOUIE:
     Oh, Emily, it's Louie.

17:53.971 --> 17:56.239
Hi. Just some
                     bric-a-brac

17:56.273 --> 17:57.908
I didn't have time
                   to take home.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.276
I'm not moving in yet.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.912
(snickering)
   Uh, Louie.

18:03.848 --> 18:06.717
I don't know quite
        how to put this.

18:06.751 --> 18:08.552
It's about last night.

18:08.586 --> 18:10.254
Ah... (laughs).

18:10.288 --> 18:11.588
Were you taller?

18:11.623 --> 18:13.757
Huh?

18:13.791 --> 18:16.526
Were you a lot better dressed?

18:16.561 --> 18:19.329
Nope.

18:19.363 --> 18:20.697
Did you have more hair?

18:20.732 --> 18:23.634
Well, not last night,
        but I did once.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.036
What's going on here?

18:26.071 --> 18:29.173
Louie, last night...

18:29.207 --> 18:31.241
was a mistake.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.443
"Mistake"? What do you mean?
   What're you talkin' about?

18:33.477 --> 18:35.712
I wasn't myself last night.

18:35.746 --> 18:38.415
Well, whoever you were,
      applause, applause.

18:38.449 --> 18:41.485
Look, Louie, I was
         really sick last night.

18:41.519 --> 18:43.420
I shouldn't have had
that wine and, frankly,

18:43.455 --> 18:45.322
I had a lot too many
of those pills.

18:45.356 --> 18:46.590
Was that it?
            You're out of pills.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.592
I can get you pills.

18:48.626 --> 18:52.162
No, you're forcing me to be
completely honest with you.

18:52.196 --> 18:55.499
In the light of day,
  you're gross and disgusting.

19:01.539 --> 19:03.707
So what?

19:03.741 --> 19:06.876
Uh, Emily, uh, some
  of the finest things in life

19:06.911 --> 19:09.079
are repulsive at first.

19:09.113 --> 19:10.947
Uh, look, look at caviar.

19:10.982 --> 19:14.017
Uh, Louie, um, I didn't want
  to discuss my personal life

19:14.051 --> 19:16.720
with you anymore,
                     but I will.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.322
My boyfriend
                  wants me back.

19:18.356 --> 19:19.590
Huh?

19:19.624 --> 19:21.258
He's gonna be here
        in five minutes.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.326
Now, he's very territorial
      when it comes to me,

19:23.361 --> 19:24.995
and I don't want him
        to see you here.

19:25.029 --> 19:26.363
But wha...

19:26.365 --> 19:27.998
I can't leave.

19:28.032 --> 19:29.600
I lost Zena.

19:29.634 --> 19:31.869
I mean, you're all I got left.

19:31.903 --> 19:33.737
I could go back to one,
            but zip?

19:33.772 --> 19:35.372
I can't do zip again.

19:35.406 --> 19:36.406
(doorbell buzzes)

19:36.440 --> 19:37.574
Oh, God. There he is.

19:37.608 --> 19:39.542
Um, I'll go downstairs
                  and stall him.

19:39.577 --> 19:41.145
You'd better get your things
            and get out of here.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.013
He's crazy jealous.
       (doorbell buzzes)

19:43.047 --> 19:44.614
Take the freight
          elevator to the cellar

19:44.649 --> 19:46.583
and go out through the alley.
But Emily...

20:04.201 --> 20:06.103
Oh, Reiger...

20:06.137 --> 20:08.105
Reiger, you're here.

20:08.139 --> 20:11.141
Thank God!
                      Thank God!

20:11.176 --> 20:13.943
Thank God you're here!
What's...?

20:13.978 --> 20:15.478
Thank you, God!
Louie, Louie.

20:15.513 --> 20:18.482
What is it?
     Reiger, you got to help me.

20:18.516 --> 20:20.717
You got to help me.
What? What?

20:20.752 --> 20:23.920
I'm at the lowest point
              in my life.

20:25.623 --> 20:29.259
I lost Zena,
         and Emily sobered up.

20:31.896 --> 20:33.930
She thinks I'm disgusting.

20:33.964 --> 20:36.232
Well, you've heard that before.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.234
Reiger...

20:38.269 --> 20:41.038
I had it all!

20:41.072 --> 20:44.574
I had Zena, an adorable,

20:44.609 --> 20:46.777
sensitive woman.

20:46.811 --> 20:50.414
A woman with a heart
                as big as a pig.

20:52.516 --> 20:54.551
And I had Emily.

20:55.986 --> 20:58.054
She was sensuous

20:58.089 --> 21:00.323
and exciting.

21:00.357 --> 21:02.592
She made me do things

21:02.627 --> 21:05.395
that I never did
     with any other woman.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.263
I don't think
      I want to hear this.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.700
Reiger!
     What?

21:09.734 --> 21:12.736
I talked baby talk to her.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.204
"Baby talk"?

21:14.238 --> 21:15.605
What're you talkin' about?

21:15.640 --> 21:17.340
I said...

21:17.375 --> 21:22.145
(talks baby talk)

21:22.180 --> 21:24.781
I was right, I was right.
           Reiger...

21:24.815 --> 21:26.417
I don't want to hear this.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.784
What?

21:27.818 --> 21:31.421
I even said,
            "I wuv you."

21:33.324 --> 21:36.093
I got nothing left, Reiger.

21:36.127 --> 21:38.962
I can't ever get Zena back, no!

21:38.997 --> 21:40.797
She'll never
                come back to me,

21:40.832 --> 21:42.699
not after as mad
                     as she was.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.968
No way!

21:45.002 --> 21:47.471
There's nothing
              I can do, nothing.

21:47.505 --> 21:49.039
Well, there's
always the obvious.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.308
Oh, no, no, no.

21:52.343 --> 21:54.678
I'm not going to give you
  some trick to get Zena back.

21:54.712 --> 21:56.479
I think she's well rid of you.

21:56.514 --> 21:58.648
But, but you know
       there's something?

21:58.682 --> 22:00.851
I have a mind.
     I have a thought, yes,

22:00.885 --> 22:03.253
but I'm not going to tell you.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.855
This is what's called
    "just desserts," Louie.

22:05.890 --> 22:09.593
Reiger...

22:09.627 --> 22:11.561
I gotta tell you.

22:12.630 --> 22:15.031
I'm so sorry for what I did.

22:16.934 --> 22:18.402
I want to die.

22:18.436 --> 22:20.370
(crying)

22:21.439 --> 22:23.473
I'm all alone.

22:23.507 --> 22:25.408
It's too much.

22:25.442 --> 22:27.644
Uh...

22:27.679 --> 22:29.346
(continues crying)

22:30.414 --> 22:32.449
Louie. Louie, please.

22:32.483 --> 22:34.250
Louie, would you
please... Please!

22:34.285 --> 22:36.854
Louie. Louie!

22:38.088 --> 22:39.956
Look, Louie.

22:39.991 --> 22:42.559
They're probably not even
 talking to each other anymore,

22:42.593 --> 22:44.561
and Zena doesn't
       know what you did.

22:44.595 --> 22:48.699
Look, Louie, all you have to do
     is go to Zena and say,

22:48.733 --> 22:51.134
"I've given up Emily for you.

22:51.168 --> 22:52.969
And I'm never
    going to see her again."

22:53.003 --> 22:55.272
And then you'd better promise
her that you're going to spend

22:55.306 --> 22:57.573
the rest of your life
making up for what you did.

22:57.608 --> 22:59.242
And you'd better
mean it, Louie.

22:59.277 --> 23:02.612
And then, maybe then,
she'll take you back.

23:02.646 --> 23:04.047
(crying stops)

23:04.081 --> 23:06.016
That'll work.

23:07.252 --> 23:08.985
It's so simple.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.356
I couldn't think of it
    because I was too depressed.

23:12.390 --> 23:16.726
But I knew if I cried
           some crocodile tears,

23:16.761 --> 23:20.797
I could get your mind
         working for me, Reiger.

23:20.832 --> 23:21.998
Excuse me.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.533
I'm off to get
                  my woman back.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.536
Oh, no! No! No!

23:26.571 --> 23:28.538
How could I let this
         happen again?

23:28.572 --> 23:30.073
I promised I wouldn't
                   let it happen

23:30.107 --> 23:31.341
to me again,
                and it happened!

23:31.376 --> 23:33.076
I'm such a jerk!

23:36.180 --> 23:38.114
Alex.

23:38.149 --> 23:39.983
What?!

23:42.353 --> 23:44.288
The tears were real.

24:27.998 --> 24:29.432
WOMAN:
             Night, Mr. Walters!

24:29.467 --> 24:30.467
(grumbling)
