and be sure everyone
is eating a tomato.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.850
You can eat those?

19:46.585 --> 19:47.818
Yes.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.859
Welcome to
Hotel Transylvania.
(BRAINS GASP)

19:54.861 --> 19:55.760
(CHUCKLES) Oh, this?

19:55.762 --> 19:58.863
This is just a mild case
of the 24-hour zombie flu.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.366
You rest assured
it's totally isolated

20:02.368 --> 20:04.235
and not contagious at all.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.103
(ALL GASP)

20:09.541 --> 20:11.209
Tomato!

20:11.211 --> 20:13.010
(ALL SHRIEKING)

20:16.381 --> 20:18.049
(SCREAMING)

20:18.051 --> 20:19.917
Where are you going?

20:25.991 --> 20:27.692
(TIRES SCREECHING)

20:28.026 --> 20:28.459
They're leaving.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.996
Seems like for
whatever reason they
changed their minds.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.164
(LAUGHING)

20:33.166 --> 20:34.699
Get it?
"Minds"?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.634
(LAUGHING)

20:36.902 --> 20:38.502
Not at all.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.071
This is a daydream.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.340
The Meeting of the Minds
is huge business.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.209
Hotel Transylvania
will be ruined.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.211
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

20:47.213 --> 20:48.012
(PHONE RINGING)

20:48.014 --> 20:51.716
(PHONE CONVERSATION
IN GIBBERISH CONTINUES)

20:52.718 --> 20:55.953
The Cramptons?
What's in the Cramptons?

20:55.955 --> 21:00.191
Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.425
Let's do this.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.462
(FIREWORKS WHISTLING,
EXPLODING)

21:10.502 --> 21:11.435
Whoa.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.170
(BEEPING PHONE OFF)

21:13.739 --> 21:18.442
So, I guess maybe
you need a place
to stay after all.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.283
Ah, very well.

21:25.584 --> 21:27.451
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

21:27.453 --> 21:29.253
Yes! We did it.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.588
We're staying.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.023
Boom drac-a-lacka!

21:32.025 --> 21:33.758
For once, scamming
the old folks

21:33.760 --> 21:35.359
doesn't blow up
in our faces,

21:35.361 --> 21:38.629
and I said that
out loud, didn't I?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.164
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

21:40.166 --> 21:43.301
I'm afraid I have to agree
with my gooey friend here.

21:43.303 --> 21:47.038
We'll need to keep
a much closer eye
on you two.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.406
(BOTH SCREAMING)

21:48.408 --> 21:49.240
Come, Mr. Blob.

21:49.242 --> 21:51.375
Diane and I
will help you unpack.

21:51.377 --> 21:52.710
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

21:52.712 --> 21:53.644
(LYDIA LAUGHING)

21:53.646 --> 21:58.149
At least they finally
left us alone.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.152
Oh.
(WATER SPLASHING)

22:01.154 --> 22:04.922
I look great in hats.
