BRIGHTON ROCK

01:34.914 --> 01:37.576
Come on, Spicer.

01:37.708 --> 01:41.291
Pick up the phone,
you drunken cur's son, you.

01:42.168 --> 01:46.411
You old drunk. Get off the fucking sofa,
you old cur's son!

01:47.884 --> 01:51.092
Come on, Spicer.
I need the boys down here.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.211
I'm in a bit of trouble here.

01:55.889 --> 01:57.880
Oh, fuck.

02:00.226 --> 02:01.715
Hello.

02:02.897 --> 02:03.886
Hello?

02:04.023 --> 02:06.355
Old Kitesy's got two rats on his tail.

02:06.483 --> 02:08.643
Eh? Eh? Let's get out of here.

02:08.775 --> 02:10.186
Whoa.

02:19.829 --> 02:22.194
Come on. Come on. Yeah?

02:22.329 --> 02:23.820
You.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.201
Your turn. You're first.

02:29.669 --> 02:31.159
Argh.

03:31.180 --> 03:33.763
Kite should never
have taken on Colleoni.

03:35.724 --> 03:37.934
Without Kite, this mob's finished.

03:38.063 --> 03:40.975
- I say we lay low.
- We lay low, they'll stamp on us.

03:41.107 --> 03:43.643
I say we hit back. Dallow?

03:45.318 --> 03:47.354
No one gets near Colleoni.

03:47.487 --> 03:49.318
Then we carve his cronies.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.937
Starting with the cunt
what stuck Kite.

03:52.574 --> 03:54.987
What do you say, Spicer?

03:55.119 --> 03:57.530
Pinkie, you get a good look at him, kid?

04:02.667 --> 04:05.499
No, no, listen, Mr Colleoni.

04:05.627 --> 04:07.582
It was an accident, I'm telling you.

04:07.711 --> 04:09.545
He was tooled up.

04:11.217 --> 04:13.376
Mr Colleoni? Mr...

05:21.610 --> 05:26.602
You pull a chiv, son...
you'd better be ready to use it.

05:43.502 --> 05:45.996
"The young have captured
this ancient island

05:46.132 --> 05:49.420
"and taken command in a country
where youth has always before

05:49.552 --> 05:52.544
"been kept properly in its place.

05:52.678 --> 05:56.420
"Suddenly, the young own the town. "

05:57.015 --> 05:59.006
Hello, Ida.

06:00.059 --> 06:03.143
- Port and lemon, Bell.
- You were young once, you old ghost.

06:03.272 --> 06:04.852
One minute they want the vote,

06:04.982 --> 06:09.097
the next minute the feckless gobshites
are tearing up the south coast.

06:09.233 --> 06:13.067
Yeah. Bring back the birch, I say.
Larrup it out of 'em.

06:13.196 --> 06:14.982
You want to take care.

06:15.114 --> 06:18.948
First Hastings, then Margate.
Brighton'll be bleedin' next.

06:21.036 --> 06:24.278
Oh. Give us a moment, sweetheart.

06:26.332 --> 06:28.323
Right you are, Ida.

06:39.469 --> 06:41.301
Fancy a dance, girl?

06:43.098 --> 06:44.759
Hello, Fred.

06:44.890 --> 06:46.220
Usual?

06:46.348 --> 06:48.682
Yeah. Yeah, just a quickie.

06:48.811 --> 06:50.642
Port and lemon.

06:52.355 --> 06:54.017
Not having one yourself?

06:54.150 --> 06:57.481
I've had enough.
Don't want to get sleepy.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.270
What is it this time, Fred?

07:02.822 --> 07:04.610
Oh, I'm...

07:04.742 --> 07:07.323
I'm in Dutch, Ida, you know.

07:08.077 --> 07:10.443
- How much?
- Not here, eh?

07:10.580 --> 07:12.409
I haven't got it, Fred.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.410
Fancy some lunch?

07:17.543 --> 07:20.287
What was it? Dogs or gee-gees?

07:20.423 --> 07:21.913
- It's complicated.
- Oh.

07:23.466 --> 07:25.046
It's that bad, is it?

07:26.342 --> 07:30.301
Come for a bite, Ida, please. Old times.

07:35.269 --> 07:38.759
You don't look well.
Fred, you're not sick, are you?

07:38.896 --> 07:41.683
Come for lunch, Ida, please.
I... I need the company.

07:41.815 --> 07:43.975
Why don't you have a bite here?

07:44.108 --> 07:45.768
You can make him a ham sandwich,
can't you?

07:45.900 --> 07:49.063
- I can make him a ham sandwich.
- No, thanks.

07:53.659 --> 07:54.819
Best be getting on.

07:57.829 --> 07:59.819
Thanks, anyway.

08:23.643 --> 08:25.506
Hey! Oi!

08:37.361 --> 08:39.570
Ready? One, two, three.

08:45.162 --> 08:48.324
- Do you want a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

08:48.456 --> 08:50.446
Fuck off, then.

08:53.709 --> 08:54.871
Give us a stick of rock.

09:29.034 --> 09:31.364
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

09:34.538 --> 09:38.246
- You down for the day, yeah?
- I'm on a break from Snows.

09:38.373 --> 09:39.862
That's nice.

09:40.541 --> 09:42.374
You gonna sit on your own all day,
are you?

09:42.503 --> 09:44.538
I've got to get back in a minute.

09:44.670 --> 09:45.878
Fancy a stroll?

09:46.006 --> 09:48.543
We could pop up the prom.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

09:48.676 --> 09:50.665
No, I couldn't be late back from lunch.

09:52.594 --> 09:54.504
I'm Fred, by the way.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.127
Rose.

09:58.663 --> 09:59.794
Fancy a drink, Rose?

09:59.821 --> 10:01.601
You're very kind
but I'd better get back.

10:02.437 --> 10:04.893
Never mind, I'll walk you.
I know Snows.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.263
There you are, Fred.

10:09.399 --> 10:10.980
This is my new friend, Rose.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.227
Pleased to meet you, Rose.
Where are we going, Fred?

10:13.365 --> 10:16.025
- We're going for something to eat.
- I've got to get back.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.444
- I know a good place.
- Does it do sundaes? They're your fave.

10:19.576 --> 10:22.408
- I couldn't possibly...
- The best sundaes.

10:24.079 --> 10:26.196
Forget it. Rose likes splits best.
Don't you?

10:26.333 --> 10:27.822
Let's go, Fred.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.995
- I said, let's go.
- Say cheese.

10:30.128 --> 10:32.493
There you are. Lovely!

10:32.630 --> 10:34.789
You have been pom-pommed.

10:34.922 --> 10:39.166
There you are, love.
Whatever you do, don't lose the slip.

10:39.303 --> 10:43.385
No slip, no photo. All right?
Pom Pom's, just there.

11:50.698 --> 11:52.062
Ah!

12:50.457 --> 12:52.119
We was only supposed to carve him.

12:52.252 --> 12:55.334
Just enough to let
Colleoni know we ain't finished.

12:55.462 --> 12:56.747
He knows.

12:56.879 --> 13:00.165
You're a runner, Pinkie.
You don't do nothing without our say-so.

13:00.297 --> 13:03.540
If we meant to kill him,
we'd have done it ourselves.

13:03.677 --> 13:05.836
Spicer. The bird from Snows -
she get a good look at you?

13:05.970 --> 13:08.428
More than a good look.
She got a bloody photograph!

13:08.557 --> 13:11.923
- That ain't the kid's fault.
- Whose fault is it, then?

13:12.060 --> 13:16.644
Lousy seaside snap wouldn't matter
if we wasn't accessories to a murder.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.979
Christ Al-fucking-mighty.
We could hang for this.

13:20.108 --> 13:22.098
We'd better get hold of that photo...

13:22.234 --> 13:25.270
- Well done, Dallow.
- ... before anyone else does.

13:25.404 --> 13:26.563
Brilliant.

13:26.697 --> 13:30.110
Pinkie, you'll get hold
of the photograph, won't you, boy?

13:32.451 --> 13:34.989
- Why me?
- You're a pickpocket, ain't you?

13:35.121 --> 13:38.656
Don't be soft. I ain't got the slip.
"No slip, no photo. "

13:38.788 --> 13:41.328
So snatch the slip, boy.

15:03.740 --> 15:05.980
- Can I help you, sir?
- I want to order.

15:06.115 --> 15:09.107
- You're late for lunch, I'm sorry.
- I want a cup of tea.

15:09.244 --> 15:11.825
Would you mind sitting at
one of the tables laid for tea?

15:15.124 --> 15:16.785
This table suits me.

15:17.795 --> 15:18.952
It does.

15:19.086 --> 15:22.543
It's next to the door you'll be leaving
through as soon as you've finished.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.912
And a plate of biscuits.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.583
- Rose?
- Coming, Miss Arnold.

15:26.507 --> 15:28.750
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

15:29.302 --> 15:30.794
It's all right.

15:35.141 --> 15:37.256
Miss Arnold just gave me a lecture.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.851
I wouldn't mind but it wasn't my fault.
I was late back from lunch.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.892
A man on the... Oh!

15:43.023 --> 15:45.512
A man on the pier... Sorry.

15:45.652 --> 15:47.562
I get nervous and I talk too much.

15:48.485 --> 15:50.272
Out for a stroll?

15:50.405 --> 15:53.191
- Sorry?
- You and your boyfriend?

15:53.323 --> 15:56.656
No, I'd never seen him before
in my life.

15:56.785 --> 16:01.026
I was on my lunch break and a friend
of his turned up and he just ran off.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.529
Why would someone do that?

16:03.667 --> 16:06.078
Some fellas don't know
how to treat a girl.

16:06.837 --> 16:09.702
You're like me - old-fashioned.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.122
Am I?

16:11.257 --> 16:13.621
You and me have got a bit in common.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.588
You're the kind of girl I like.

16:18.388 --> 16:20.218
I like a girl who's friendly.

16:21.932 --> 16:24.422
Some of them, they freeze you.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.891
They freeze me.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.852
You're sensitive. That's what that is.

16:30.981 --> 16:32.971
Like me.

16:34.276 --> 16:36.858
You and me should go out one evening.

16:36.987 --> 16:39.068
Go to the pictures.

16:41.865 --> 16:43.651
- What's your name?
- Rose.

16:45.035 --> 16:46.865
Rose.

16:47.620 --> 16:49.704
- I'm Pinkie.
- Pleased to meet you.

16:53.168 --> 16:54.156
But your tea...

16:54.294 --> 16:57.456
We've been talking and I had
an appointment at 4.30 sharp.

16:57.588 --> 17:00.669
- Sorry, you should have stopped me.
- That's all right.

17:00.798 --> 17:02.287
I liked it.

17:03.176 --> 17:06.135
It's only ten to, anyway.
What time do you get off?

17:07.013 --> 17:10.505
We don't close till half-past six,
except on Sundays.

17:11.099 --> 17:14.340
How about tonight? Quarter to eight.

17:14.478 --> 17:15.967
Oh...

17:16.646 --> 17:18.977
- Unless you've got other plans?
- Oh, no.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.597
Tonight, then.

17:21.484 --> 17:23.474
Pavilion Gardens.

17:24.362 --> 17:26.771
You and me
have got things in common...

17:27.405 --> 17:28.393
...Rose.

17:29.741 --> 17:31.572
Pinkie.

17:53.846 --> 17:57.678
- Thank you, Pinkie.
- Stick it on your wall and pray.

18:00.851 --> 18:02.841
You're a Roman, ain't you?

18:06.144 --> 18:08.014
Oh, this.

18:08.150 --> 18:10.140
I told you we had things in common.

18:21.411 --> 18:23.400
I'm a Roman, too.

18:24.622 --> 18:26.112
I used to be in the choir.

18:27.457 --> 18:29.287
Do you go to Mass?

18:32.254 --> 18:35.119
- But you believe, though?
- Course I do.

18:35.256 --> 18:37.837
It's the only thing that
makes any sense.

18:39.135 --> 18:41.376
Them atheists have got it all wrong.

18:42.636 --> 18:44.798
Course there's a hell.

18:44.931 --> 18:47.763
Flames, damnation...

18:49.059 --> 18:50.390
...and torments.

18:51.811 --> 18:54.300
And a heaven, too, Pinkie.

18:54.438 --> 18:56.271
Heaven?

18:59.153 --> 19:00.767
Maybe.

19:18.834 --> 19:23.578
? I'll never stop loving you

19:25.048 --> 19:29.964
? Whatever else I may do

19:30.597 --> 19:34.928
? My love for you

19:36.391 --> 19:41.977
? Will live till time itself is through

19:44.650 --> 19:47.139
? I'll never stop...

19:47.276 --> 19:49.268
Want to dance?

19:50.945 --> 19:52.811
Yes, Pinkie.

19:55.407 --> 19:56.396
Come on, then.

19:56.534 --> 20:01.529
? My heart will beat

20:02.248 --> 20:08.082
? The way it does each time we meet

20:08.878 --> 20:13.337
? The night doesn't question

20:13.464 --> 20:21.304
? The stars that appear in the skies

20:22.014 --> 20:26.007
? So, why should I question

20:26.142 --> 20:33.811
? The stars that appear in my eyes?

20:36.111 --> 20:41.854
? Of this I'm more than just sure

20:42.366 --> 20:47.781
? My love will last and endure

20:47.912 --> 20:49.994
? I'll never

20:50.832 --> 20:57.452
? No, I'll never stop loving you...?

21:52.450 --> 21:54.003
You ever been in love?

21:01.257 --> 21:02.748
Oh, yes.

21:04.218 --> 21:06.460
Yeah, you would say that.

21:08.013 --> 21:12.631
You're green.
You don't know what people do.

21:17.812 --> 21:19.805
You can keep doing that...

21:21.151 --> 21:22.980
...if you like it.

21:26.737 --> 21:28.522
Don't be soft.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.659
Did I do something wrong, Pinkie?

21:46.921 --> 21:47.910
Let's go.

21:48.047 --> 21:50.755
- It's him.
- Who?

21:50.885 --> 21:53.625
The man on the pier.
The one I told you about.

21:55.221 --> 21:57.176
Are you sure?
Maybe it just looks like him.

21:57.847 --> 21:59.838
It is him, Pinkie.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.432
I never forget a face.

22:05.564 --> 22:10.523
"Police... appeal for... witnesses. "

22:10.651 --> 22:13.141
One minute we were sitting
here on the pier, just here,

22:13.277 --> 22:14.766
and now...

22:15.404 --> 22:16.735
- Oh!
- What now?

22:16.863 --> 22:19.946
I almost forgot.
A man from Pom Pom's took a photo.

22:20.075 --> 22:23.488
Of all three of us.
Me and Hale and the other man.

22:24.539 --> 22:26.869
I'll show you. I've still got the slip.

22:28.248 --> 22:30.113
- I don't understand...
- Have you lost it?

22:30.249 --> 22:31.990
It was in my coat pocket, Pinkie.

22:32.127 --> 22:33.868
- You must have dropped it.
- I put it here.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.664
- It fell out.
- I buttoned it.

22:35.796 --> 22:37.662
- Never mind.
- There'll be a picture in the window.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.630
Never mind!

22:47.059 --> 22:49.298
He was frightened, Pinkie, Fred Hale.

22:50.101 --> 22:51.680
So what?

22:51.809 --> 22:54.052
He probably owed the other bloke money.

22:54.189 --> 22:56.019
It happens all the time.

22:56.690 --> 22:58.806
Chances are, the other geezer
was a bookie.

22:58.944 --> 23:02.606
Did he look like a bookie to you,
the other fella?

23:03.528 --> 23:05.018
I wouldn't know.

23:05.698 --> 23:08.062
You probably didn't get
a good look at him, then.

23:08.198 --> 23:10.863
Oh, yes, I've got a memory for faces.

23:20.377 --> 23:21.866
I like you.

23:23.714 --> 23:25.546
So I'm gonna warn you.

23:26.592 --> 23:31.506
This bloke, Hale,
I heard he was mixed up in stuff.

23:31.637 --> 23:33.467
What stuff?

23:34.639 --> 23:36.504
Never mind what stuff.

23:36.641 --> 23:38.973
You've heard of Peggy Baron, right?

23:39.477 --> 23:41.969
You must have.
It was in all the papers.

23:42.855 --> 23:46.689
She got herself mixed up with a mob
and they came after her.

23:47.776 --> 23:49.060
What happened to her?

23:52.488 --> 23:54.228
She wouldn't keep her mouth shut.

23:55.115 --> 23:57.358
So they splashed acid in her face.

23:58.494 --> 23:59.984
She lost an eye.

24:02.247 --> 24:03.737
Acid?

24:07.959 --> 24:09.951
Sulphuric acid.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.631
It burns.

24:19.136 --> 24:20.547
- Smell it.
- Pinkie!

24:20.680 --> 24:22.510
I'm only pulling your leg.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.300
It's not acid. It's just spirit.

24:24.432 --> 24:27.047
I had to warn you, that's all.

24:27.185 --> 24:29.267
You and me are friends, aren't we?

24:30.064 --> 24:33.305
I wouldn't want a friend
with a face burnt off, now, would I?

24:39.030 --> 24:41.770
You tell me
if anyone asks any questions.

24:41.905 --> 24:45.445
Anyone, mind.
You get me on the blower straight off.

24:45.577 --> 24:47.693
Brighton 33945.

24:49.371 --> 24:53.784
You have to swear to me
you'll keep your mouth shut, Rose.

24:59.716 --> 25:01.204
I swear.

25:14.558 --> 25:16.391
Spot of bother?

25:18.731 --> 25:20.561
No bother.

25:28.697 --> 25:30.357
She's safe.

25:31.575 --> 25:33.110
No bitch is safe.

25:50.050 --> 25:53.291
'? I gotta a woman and I love her mad

25:53.427 --> 25:56.715
'? I gotta a woman
and she's mine all right...?'

25:58.472 --> 26:00.711
She loves me...

26:01.892 --> 26:02.974
She loves me not.

26:07.356 --> 26:10.768
- What do you want, Spicer?
- Don't you talk to me like that.

26:10.901 --> 26:14.482
You're just a kid. I run this mob now.

26:14.610 --> 26:16.522
I've got experience.
I've put in the years.

26:16.655 --> 26:20.274
- It's a lot of years.
- Maybe. But I've got nous.

26:20.409 --> 26:21.946
'It's 8am. Here are the news headlines. '

26:22.078 --> 26:23.066
Ssh.

26:23.204 --> 26:25.443

Not if she knows what's good for her.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.601
Enjoy it.

27:05.029 --> 27:08.022
Rose, can I have a word with you?

27:13.289 --> 27:14.777
That man you met.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.412
What man?

27:17.541 --> 27:20.407
The bloke on the pier -
the one who tried to pick you up.

27:20.542 --> 27:23.537
Don't be shy. You were late
for the afternoon tea, remember?

27:23.673 --> 27:26.254
- Yeah, I remember.
- What did he look like?

27:31.135 --> 27:32.717
Ordinary.

27:32.846 --> 27:34.587
- Skinny fellow?
- Not especially.

27:34.723 --> 27:36.930
- With tattoos?
- I can't remember.

27:37.058 --> 27:38.890
Is this him?

27:41.396 --> 27:44.011
I wasn't wearing my glasses.

27:45.524 --> 27:49.358
H is name was Fred Hale
and he was a friend of mine.

27:49.486 --> 27:53.317
- A friend?
- Yeah. A gentleman friend.

27:54.157 --> 27:57.490
Nothing serious but...
I was fond of him.

27:57.618 --> 27:59.447
Poor old Fred.

28:03.998 --> 28:05.406
I'm sorry, Miss Arnold.

28:07.208 --> 28:10.872
What's the matter?
You don't look well, sweetheart.

28:11.005 --> 28:13.586
Nothing's the matter, Miss Arnold.
I just...

28:15.091 --> 28:18.172
I'm sorry to hear about your friend,
that's all.

28:18.301 --> 28:21.668
My father's not been well
and I haven't been eating properly.

28:21.804 --> 28:24.625
- I should get back to work.
- You have a lie-down in my office.

28:24.754 --> 28:25.845
I should get back to the afternoon teas.

28:25.848 --> 28:28.956
I said have a lie-down in my office.

28:42.700 --> 28:45.314
- I'm here to collect.
- You!

28:47.912 --> 28:49.616
Excuse me.

28:49.745 --> 28:52.328
This is a top-notch business.
It needs top-notch protection.

28:52.457 --> 28:55.072
Your lot's glory days are over.

28:55.751 --> 29:00.165
Kite's mob?
They couldn't even protect Kite.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.258
I can't pay you both.

29:07.387 --> 29:11.470
I would have been stabbed in the heart
if I hadn't paid Colleoni.

29:12.809 --> 29:15.925
Look around you.
Colleoni is running things now.

29:16.062 --> 29:19.519
And bigger, better than Kite ever could.

29:20.482 --> 29:22.562
Take my advice, kid.

29:23.148 --> 29:24.639
Clear out of Brighton.

29:30.783 --> 29:33.898
Christ Al-fucking-mighty.

29:34.034 --> 29:35.524
You're in the shit now, boy.

29:35.661 --> 29:37.695
I've got protection.

29:37.830 --> 29:41.163
Look at him, Dallow.
He's got protection.

29:43.626 --> 29:46.618
That's so you know who's protecting you.

29:59.472 --> 30:00.963
Oi.

30:02.351 --> 30:04.342
Expenses.

30:07.147 --> 30:08.808
- Where next?
- Home.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.099
We lay low till we know
we're in the clear for Hale.

30:11.982 --> 30:14.396
- Spicer's orders.
- Spicer's milky.

30:14.528 --> 30:18.021
We lay low and they'll bury us alive.
There's betting shops all over town.

30:18.157 --> 30:21.069
- Colleoni's betting shops.
- It's our town, ain't it?

30:22.994 --> 30:24.856
Colleoni's boys.

30:24.994 --> 30:26.485
That squealer Corkery.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.500
Fuck!

30:35.006 --> 30:37.085
You run, you're no better than Spicer,
Cubitt.

30:37.212 --> 30:40.001
I could do with the exercise.

30:40.134 --> 30:42.749
- Leave it to me, Pinkie.
- No, I ain't running.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.962
Get out the way.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.714
Hello.

31:34.846 --> 31:37.635
- Pinkie?
- Who wants him?

31:47.565 --> 31:50.477
? Well we don't care what they say

31:50.611 --> 31:54.103
? We're gonna keep on loving
this way...?

33:16.712 --> 33:19.274
- Who is this?
- It's Rose.

31:58.702 --> 32:01.818
- There's no Pinkie here.
- Is this Brighton 33945?

32:01.955 --> 32:03.239
You've got the wrong number.

33:24.984 --> 33:27.021
There appears to have been some mistake.

33:27.737 --> 33:30.320
Mr Colleoni is expecting someone...

33:31.366 --> 33:32.445
...older.

33:34.409 --> 33:37.241
His boys tried to nab me, didn't they?

33:37.369 --> 33:39.780
If talking's what he wants,
he might as well talk to me.

33:39.914 --> 33:42.748
- I doubt Mr Colleoni...
- He can talk to me.

33:58.931 --> 34:00.763
Who sent you?

34:01.808 --> 34:03.640
You did.

34:05.978 --> 34:09.094
I mean, who's running your mob
if Kite's dead?

34:09.231 --> 34:11.062
I am.

34:15.570 --> 34:17.106
Something funny?

34:17.239 --> 34:20.730
- What happened to Hale?
- What happened to Kite?

34:20.864 --> 34:22.355
There's a difference.

34:22.492 --> 34:25.484
- I don't see no difference.
- You don't see much.

34:27.831 --> 34:31.449
Kite was an accident.
People make mistakes.

34:35.043 --> 34:37.627
Now, as it stands,

34:37.755 --> 34:42.590
the bogeys have turned a blind eye
to our little contretemps.

34:44.009 --> 34:46.002
But if I give the signal...

34:52.601 --> 34:56.344
Gambling is a legitimate business now,
Mr Brown.

34:58.898 --> 35:02.390
I keep it clean... and tidy.

35:02.528 --> 35:04.485
They like it that way.

35:04.613 --> 35:07.275
Then you'd better stop trespassing.

35:08.616 --> 35:10.607
It ain't healthy.

35:14.369 --> 35:16.361
I like you.

35:18.127 --> 35:21.708
You're a promising young man.

35:22.963 --> 35:25.794
That's why I'm talking to you
like a father.

35:28.132 --> 35:30.293
You need a job, you come to me.

35:31.510 --> 35:33.503
You can't damage a business like ours.

35:33.638 --> 35:35.675
I could damage you.

35:43.229 --> 35:46.061
Mr Corkery's been complaining.

35:46.773 --> 35:49.265
You don't do that again. Not here.

35:51.863 --> 35:53.852
Brighton's on the move.

35:55.741 --> 35:57.982
She's not what she used to be.

35:59.535 --> 36:03.025
And you, whoever you think you are...

36:04.582 --> 36:06.572
...you won't last.

36:11.087 --> 36:13.247
I haven't even started.

36:32.228 --> 36:34.060
What do you want?

36:35.107 --> 36:37.440
Oh, hello. Got a warrant?

36:56.793 --> 37:01.207
Bogeys... doing Colleoni's job for him.

37:04.549 --> 37:09.542
Are you seriously telling me
that you are running Kite's gang now?

37:11.974 --> 37:15.808
What good is a young lad like you
up against the Colleoni mob?

37:16.519 --> 37:17.929
How much is he paying you?

37:19.478 --> 37:20.968
Right...

37:22.605 --> 37:24.690
Let's talk about Hale.

37:26.486 --> 37:28.477
I'm looking into things, Pinkie.

37:29.572 --> 37:32.733
- Motives.
- Bully for you.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.940
Kite was like a father to you.

37:38.999 --> 37:41.330
- You got nothing on me.
- Yet.

37:43.167 --> 37:47.078
But sooner or later...
someone's gonna talk.

37:49.755 --> 37:51.542
And when they do...

37:52.590 --> 37:55.755
...I'm gonna put a rope around
your scrawny little neck...

37:57.179 --> 37:59.760
...drop you through a trapdoor...

38:01.266 --> 38:04.883
...and bury you in fucking lime.

38:42.927 --> 38:45.339
He came to me for help.

38:46.763 --> 38:49.880
Well, a girl feels sorry for a geezer.

38:50.016 --> 38:52.723
Don't have to get mixed up in things.

38:52.851 --> 38:54.466
Well, someone's got to.

38:54.604 --> 38:57.890
It's the least you can do is
ask questions. I'd do the same for you.

39:00.651 --> 39:02.482
Would you?

39:04.028 --> 39:05.984
Course I would.

39:06.113 --> 39:10.446
I mean, who is this Kite fella
that you say Fred got into a fight with?

39:11.159 --> 39:12.647
Who was Kite?

39:23.169 --> 39:26.628
I telephoned you just like you said, to
tell you someone was asking questions.

39:26.756 --> 39:28.746
Only the man who answered sounded
just like...

39:28.881 --> 39:30.374
Come on!

39:31.052 --> 39:32.883
We're going for a walk.

39:37.389 --> 39:40.426
So you're saying one
of Kite's boys killed my Fred?

39:40.560 --> 39:44.051
I don't know that, Ida. Neither do you.

39:44.814 --> 39:48.477
All you can do is walk away,
that's what I'm saying.

39:48.609 --> 39:51.691
Walk away, Ida, for Christ's sake!

39:52.153 --> 39:53.689
You're frightened, Phil.

39:53.822 --> 39:55.857
I ain't frightened of a kid.

39:55.990 --> 39:59.401
Kid? What kid?

40:00.910 --> 40:04.073
- Who's been asking questions?
- Ida Arnold, Pinkie. She runs Snows.

40:04.205 --> 40:07.038
She said Fred Hale
was a gentleman friend.

40:08.417 --> 40:10.248
What did you tell her?

40:10.377 --> 40:12.834
I told her
I'd never seen Fred Hale before.

40:12.963 --> 40:15.077
I don't think I should go back to Snows.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.298
No, course you go back.
If you quit Snows now, it'll look bad.

40:19.428 --> 40:22.293
Besides, Fred Hale died natural.

40:22.431 --> 40:24.920
You said he was mixed up with a mob.

40:28.268 --> 40:30.099
Come on!

40:30.602 --> 40:32.004
Stop blabbing your mouth off.

40:32.258 --> 40:35.022
If you keep blabbing your mouth off,
I...

40:35.151 --> 40:37.232
There's geezers who'll come after you.

40:37.245 --> 40:39.020
I'm trying to help you.

40:39.153 --> 40:41.394
- Why can't you understand that?
- I do!

40:41.529 --> 40:46.523
If it wasn't for you...
I trust you, Pinkie, honestly, I do.

40:53.331 --> 40:54.820
I wouldn't trust anyone that far.

41:00.254 --> 41:02.245
Scared?

41:06.676 --> 41:08.838
Not when I'm with you.

41:48.836 --> 41:51.795
'After youth riots up and down

You're clearing out.

42:13.275 --> 42:15.139
I thought the filth had got you.

42:15.277 --> 42:17.438
- I thought...
- You thought what?

42:17.571 --> 42:19.653
I didn't know what to think.

42:23.074 --> 42:25.318
Why didn't you bring me
Rose's message?

42:25.453 --> 42:28.570
I come looking for you
as soon as she called.

42:28.706 --> 42:31.822
I saw two plainclothes coppers
pick you up outside the Cosmopolitan.

42:31.959 --> 42:34.324
You're too old for this life, Spicer.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.200
This life?

42:36.337 --> 42:38.576
This racket.

42:38.713 --> 42:42.127
You get nervous, you drink too much...

42:43.303 --> 42:45.292
...and then you mess things up.

42:45.888 --> 42:49.379
First with the photo,
then on the blower to Rose.

42:50.390 --> 42:52.803
- Now she thinks we're pals.
- You should have dealt with Rose.

42:52.934 --> 42:55.095
I told you time and time again,
no bitch is safe.

42:55.227 --> 42:57.220
Not with you about.

42:59.524 --> 43:01.605
It ain't my fault, Pinkie.

43:03.069 --> 43:05.309
I can't take the strain.

43:08.489 --> 43:10.900
So I thought I'd... go on holiday.

43:13.036 --> 43:14.868
Just go somewhere.

43:16.330 --> 43:18.241
Retire.

where I can keep an eye on you.

43:22.169 --> 43:24.874
You got me wrong, Pinkie!

43:25.003 --> 43:28.419
Why, if I was gonna rat on you
I'd have done it by now.

43:30.719 --> 43:34.801
- You don't want to be threatening me.
- What do you want, Spicer?

43:35.929 --> 43:38.763
You wanna run this mob,
you gotta buy me out.

43:43.521 --> 43:45.351
- Or?
- I talk.

43:45.482 --> 43:47.687
You talk, we'll hang.

43:49.150 --> 43:51.016
I never touched Fred Hale, Pinkie.

43:57.198 --> 43:59.440
There's a little pub up north.

43:59.952 --> 44:01.942
In Nottingham.

44:03.245 --> 44:05.111
The Blue Anchor.

44:06.624 --> 44:10.615
I've looked into it.
She serves a lovely pint.

44:11.462 --> 44:13.701
All I need is my cut.

44:14.881 --> 44:18.715
I worked my whole life for this racket.
I deserve a slice of it.

44:21.178 --> 44:23.260
You can trust me, Pinkie.

44:25.557 --> 44:27.386
You gotta trust me.

44:28.016 --> 44:30.008
The way I see it, you got no choice.

44:34.357 --> 44:36.439
You're right, Spicer.

44:37.192 --> 44:39.022
I've got no choice.

44:42.445 --> 44:44.653
I wanna talk to Mr Colleoni.

44:44.781 --> 44:46.775
Tell him it's Mr Brown.

44:52.204 --> 44:55.071
I've been thinking things over,
Mr Colleoni.

44:55.207 --> 44:58.199
I wanna accept your offer
of a joint operation.

45:00.211 --> 45:05.045
The thing is... certain people
are a liability, Mr Colleoni.

45:06.258 --> 45:08.249
To all of us.

45:09.887 --> 45:12.377
You have your boys
wait under the Palace Pier.

45:12.514 --> 45:16.096
I'll give the signal,
hand him a stick of rock.

45:16.850 --> 45:18.513
Something to remember Brighton by.

45:20.397 --> 45:22.729
Mr Colleoni?

48:13.754 --> 48:16.496
I wouldn't trust Dallow or Cubitt
with this.

48:16.633 --> 48:18.715
They're too tasty.

48:18.842 --> 48:21.674
But I might as well tell you,
I'm making peace with Colleoni.

48:21.804 --> 48:23.919
I'm all for peace, I always have been.

48:24.055 --> 48:28.264
That's what I'm gonna arrange.
A peace that lasts.

48:35.190 --> 48:39.100
You can't get me out of Brighton
a moment too soon, Pinkie.

49:50.632 --> 49:53.337
First we'll meet Colleoni's boys,
then you get your cut.

49:53.466 --> 49:56.126
Very generous, Pinkie.
Why, it would be an honour.

49:56.259 --> 49:58.841
I always said Kite was right
to take you on.

49:58.969 --> 50:01.711
You ought to see that pub.
You'd be welcome.

50:01.848 --> 50:03.713
Nottingham's a fine town,
the air's fine,

50:03.851 --> 50:06.557
and you couldn't ask for a better bitter
than the Blue Anchor's.

50:06.685 --> 50:10.678
Oh, I forgot you don't drink.
Still, you'd always be welcome, Pinkie.

50:11.190 --> 50:13.521
Well, this is it.

50:14.442 --> 50:16.273
Goodbye, Spicer.

50:16.401 --> 50:19.940
Well, what about Colleoni?
Aren't you and I gonna...

50:20.073 --> 50:23.564
We are the Mods! We are the Mods!
We are, we are the Mods!

50:44.718 --> 50:47.800
Here, a little souvenir
to remember Brighton by.

50:49.221 --> 50:50.384
Pinkie!

51:03.777 --> 51:04.855
Help me!

51:04.984 --> 51:08.604
- No, it's him. It's not me, it's him.
- Pinkie!

51:10.700 --> 51:12.611
It's him. Get off!

51:15.203 --> 51:16.693
Cunts!

51:47.898 --> 51:50.057
Hail Mary, full of grace...

51:50.191 --> 51:53.481
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

52:11.335 --> 52:14.576
I offered him a partnership.
Fair and square.

52:15.088 --> 52:18.330
I bring him Frank Spicer
and he done him in just as we agreed.

52:19.092 --> 52:21.173
Only he tried to do me in, too.

52:21.302 --> 52:22.791
Just when the bogeys
had their hands full.

52:22.927 --> 52:24.541
Rose!

52:24.677 --> 52:27.763
- You'd better go before she finds you.
- There isn't time to pray.

52:29.685 --> 52:31.767
Not properly.

52:31.896 --> 52:35.227
- Not when they mean to murder you.
- I won't let them get you.

52:37.690 --> 52:40.431
You can trust me... Pinkie.

52:43.364 --> 52:45.445
Cross my heart and hope to die.

52:47.493 --> 52:49.322
Rose?

52:51.496 --> 52:53.861
I was just looking for the mop,
Miss Arnold.

52:54.915 --> 52:57.202
In the dark?

52:58.960 --> 53:01.450
You stay away from us, you old bitch.

53:23.940 --> 53:25.476
Oh, fuck me.

53:26.066 --> 53:28.100
- What happened to Spicer?
- It was Colleoni.

53:29.445 --> 53:32.936
They waited till the fighting started,
then they got Spicer on the front.

53:34.741 --> 53:36.822
They nearly got me too.

53:37.786 --> 53:41.777
But Spicer's in his room.
I heard him just now.

54:07.143 --> 54:09.804
Come back for your precious booze,
Spicer?

54:10.814 --> 54:12.930
I thought you were dead, Pinkie.

54:13.065 --> 54:15.647
You must have heard me when you come in.

54:17.361 --> 54:21.194
You weren't going to clear out without
saying goodbye, were you, Spicer?

54:22.533 --> 54:25.070
Without letting me know you're alive?

54:25.202 --> 54:27.031
I got away.

54:37.462 --> 54:40.452
Don't forget your going-away present,
Spicer.

54:58.979 --> 55:01.436
I came as soon as I could, Ida.

55:02.316 --> 55:03.729
I'm so sorry, love.

55:03.862 --> 55:05.362
Never thought I'd live in fear
of anything.

55:06.033 --> 55:08.103
Except the atom bomb, of course.

55:08.238 --> 55:10.570
Certainly not a bunch of kids.

55:11.699 --> 55:13.156
One kid.

55:13.743 --> 55:15.903
You've had a fright, Ida.

55:17.288 --> 55:18.776
Still...

55:21.043 --> 55:23.623
- It's all over now.
- It's not over, Phil.

55:29.423 --> 55:32.085
It's not over by a long chalk.

56:04.036 --> 56:06.448
You let me in this flat, Rose Wilson.

56:12.378 --> 56:14.869
What happened that day on the pier,
Rose?

56:17.047 --> 56:19.334
Come on. You can talk to me.

56:19.466 --> 56:21.457
There's no need to be scared,
not about boys.

56:21.592 --> 56:23.585
I'm not scared.

56:24.347 --> 56:26.177
Course you're not. You're sweet on him.

56:27.391 --> 56:29.176
- You poor fool.
- What would you know?

56:29.309 --> 56:31.719
You're throwing your life away.

56:33.269 --> 56:34.929
Rose?

56:36.230 --> 56:38.061
You've got to go.

56:41.235 --> 56:44.353
Listen, I threw Fred Hale to the wolves.
I'm not gonna do the same thing to you.

56:44.489 --> 56:45.853
Please.

56:45.991 --> 56:48.822
Come on, Rose. You can talk to me.

56:48.950 --> 56:50.360
I can't. I don't...

56:50.492 --> 56:51.983
Rose?

56:52.120 --> 56:55.535
There'll be other boys, sweetheart.
Believe me, I should know.

56:55.666 --> 56:57.406
It's a good world if you don't weaken.

56:57.543 --> 56:58.828
Rose!

56:58.960 --> 57:00.118
Please go.

57:02.462 --> 57:04.953
Your boy's a murderer, Rose.

57:06.173 --> 57:09.085
I don't have any proof yet,
but I think you do.

57:09.217 --> 57:10.710
I've got nothing.

57:10.847 --> 57:13.836
I think you know more
than you're letting on.

57:15.015 --> 57:17.849
Either you talk to the police
or you're an accessory after the fact.

57:17.976 --> 57:19.716
Do you understand what that means?

57:19.853 --> 57:22.093
That means if they hang him,
they'll hang you too.

57:22.228 --> 57:24.890
- Pinkie's not a murderer.
- Pinkie!

57:25.859 --> 57:27.690
So that's his name.

57:28.527 --> 57:31.108
Now you tell that to the police
if you want to keep your job.

57:31.237 --> 57:33.899
- I don't.
- Course you do, you silly girl.

57:34.033 --> 57:35.239
You can stuff your job.

57:36.783 --> 57:38.272
Rose!

57:39.368 --> 57:40.948
You don't care what happens to me.

57:42.623 --> 57:44.705
And you think he does?

57:46.000 --> 57:47.411
"Pinkie. "

58:45.719 --> 58:48.210
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

58:48.347 --> 58:51.635
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

58:51.766 --> 58:53.595
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

58:53.724 --> 58:55.555
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

58:55.684 --> 58:58.176
Hail Mary, full of grace...

59:18.539 --> 59:20.995
'... that the riots up and down
the southeast coast

59:21.125 --> 59:23.616
'would make it impossible
to repeal capital punishment

59:23.751 --> 59:25.491
'in this country at this time.

59:25.627 --> 59:29.212
'In such a state of current lawlessness,
the Opposition Leader went on to say,

59:29.340 --> 59:33.423
'the death penalty represented civilised
society's last line of defence. '

59:33.551 --> 59:37.544
- It won't wash. Not with the filth.
- It'll wash, all right.

59:38.973 --> 59:42.387
I nflammation of the throat
is what happens when you drown.

59:45.020 --> 59:47.304
There's two tanks of booze
in Spicer's bloodstream

59:47.437 --> 59:49.303
and a suicide note in his pocket.

59:49.441 --> 59:53.524
And no-one can say any different.
Not even you, Cubitt.

59:56.238 --> 59:58.228
I want out, Pinkie.

01:00:03.284 --> 01:00:05.619
You took a stiff for a drive
down the coast.

01:00:06.497 --> 01:00:08.862
That makes you an accessory.

01:00:10.459 --> 01:00:12.289
Both of you.

01:00:35.353 --> 01:00:37.596
You told me he was killed.

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:44.727
Not here. Wait until we're alone.

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:47.687
By Colleoni's mob.

01:00:48.866 --> 01:00:51.826
So what? What's got you?

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.872
I said, what's got you?

01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:00.411
I want you to tell me the truth, Pinkie.

01:01:07.259 --> 01:01:08.795
Two teas, please.

01:01:11.886 --> 01:01:15.720
What a night, eh?
You're better off in here.

01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:21.260
Do it if you're gonna do it.

01:01:23.231 --> 01:01:24.720
Do what?

01:01:26.192 --> 01:01:28.022
You know what.

01:01:33.988 --> 01:01:36.195
There's two men dead, Pinkie.

01:01:36.324 --> 01:01:39.068
Somehow you're mixed up in it.

01:01:42.081 --> 01:01:44.241
If you'd only trust me.

01:02:02.763 --> 01:02:05.094
Why won't you trust me, Pinkie?

01:02:14.317 --> 01:02:16.772
- Let go of me! I'll scream!
- You're a good girl, Rose.

01:02:16.902 --> 01:02:19.483
I don't wanna be good!

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:30.859
You're good and I'm bad.

01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:34.364
- We're made for each other.
- Do you mean it, Pinkie?

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.411
Course I do.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:40.867
- That we're made for each other?
- I said so, didn't I?

01:02:41.921 --> 01:02:44.083
Do you know what this means?

01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:46.397
It means you'll never fink on me, Rose.

01:02:46.413 --> 01:02:49.047
It means I'll never let you down.

01:02:49.263 --> 01:02:51.596
Never, never, never.

01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:27.618
What do you get out of this?

01:03:29.716 --> 01:03:31.546
A life.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.922
Be careful, Pinkie.

01:03:46.812 --> 01:03:48.053
He gets moods.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:16.709
I thought maybe...
50 quid might be of use to you.

01:04:17.758 --> 01:04:19.748
We don't want your money.

01:04:20.593 --> 01:04:23.425
- Take it or leave it.
- Will you get out of here?

01:04:23.552 --> 01:04:25.292
We don't want no truck with you. Never!

01:04:28.056 --> 01:04:29.545
100.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.689
I couldn't let Rose go.

01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:43.734
Not to a complete stranger.

01:04:44.822 --> 01:04:47.061
Not for 100 guineas.

01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:49.030
125.

01:04:55.705 --> 01:04:57.865
How do I know you'd treat her right?

01:05:00.042 --> 01:05:01.873
150.

01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:08.540
- She's too young.
- Not with your consent.

01:05:11.762 --> 01:05:13.546
200.

01:05:13.679 --> 01:05:16.920
- You've had my final offer.
- You can't do nothing without my say-so.

01:05:17.057 --> 01:05:21.300
- Yeah, well, I'm not all that keen.
- 175.

01:05:21.437 --> 01:05:24.179
- I'll be seeing you.
- 150.

01:05:36.785 --> 01:05:40.775
You'll have to sign this.
It's the letter of consent.

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:43.535
Give me that.

01:06:27.286 --> 01:06:29.445
You gonna pull out, kid?

01:06:30.121 --> 01:06:32.954
Am I the only one in this outfit
with any brains?

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:36.072
Rose Wilson has hands on the lever
to the trapdoor.

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:38.620
One word from her and we'll swing.

01:06:38.752 --> 01:06:41.165
But you're a gent, though, Pinkie.

01:06:42.592 --> 01:06:45.253
Others would have done things
differently, but not you.

01:06:45.384 --> 01:06:47.214
That girl's
only alive cos you got heart.

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:55.013
Don't be a mug.
I'm buying time, that's all.

01:06:57.812 --> 01:06:59.803
Sure, Pinkie.

01:07:05.026 --> 01:07:07.437
Where you been? You're late.

01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:11.403
Excuse me.

01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:14.366
I was late because I went to church.

01:07:16.662 --> 01:07:18.821
To ask forgiveness.

01:07:20.455 --> 01:07:22.617
You gotta understand...

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:26.081
...this isn't a real ceremony.

01:07:26.211 --> 01:07:29.044
Not like when a priest says it.

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:33.505
This is sin, Rose. Mortal sin.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.960
It will be no good going to a church
ever again.

01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:54.272
Therefore if any man
can show any just cause

01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:56.642
why they may not be lawfully joined,

01:07:56.778 --> 01:08:01.523
let him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:08.819
If the witnesses would come forward
for the exchange of vows.

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:19.420
The ring.

01:08:23.216 --> 01:08:25.630
- No ring?
- This ain't a church.

01:08:34.395 --> 01:08:40.354
"Restless youth,
the ravaged and disputed territory...

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.064
"... between the two eternities. "

01:08:46.115 --> 01:08:47.604
That's poetry.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.823
Rose Wilson needs protection.

01:08:54.287 --> 01:08:57.618
Whatever you may think I am,
Miss Arnold,

01:08:57.747 --> 01:08:59.078
I'm a legitimate businessman.

01:09:00.459 --> 01:09:02.745
Whatever you may think I am,
Mr Colleoni,

01:09:02.879 --> 01:09:05.995
I'm no Brighton lady here on holiday,
three-sheets to the wind,

01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:08.544
looking for nothing better to do
than to have my palm read

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:11.256
and dabble in a spot
of amateur detection.

01:09:11.385 --> 01:09:13.796
Pinkie Brown killed a man.

01:09:15.511 --> 01:09:19.096
And he's going to be punished for it.
An eye for an eye.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.890
He's gonna suffer.

01:09:23.063 --> 01:09:25.428
I don't care how much it costs.

01:09:25.564 --> 01:09:32.229
With all due respect, Pinkie Brown
is like any other angry young man.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:33.902
Give him enough rope...

01:09:34.032 --> 01:09:35.895
Putting Rose Wilson in the witness box

01:09:36.033 --> 01:09:38.863
is the only legal way
we'll get rid of Pinkie Brown.

01:09:38.992 --> 01:09:41.825
And he knows it,
and that puts that girl in...

01:09:43.206 --> 01:09:45.786
...in the most grave danger.

01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:13.641
Can we get one of those as a souvenir?
They don't cost much.

01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:16.764
Don't be soft.
What's the point in that?

01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:19.892
If you don't want me,
why don't you just leave me alone?

01:10:21.322 --> 01:10:23.982
- What do you want me for?
- Jesus Christ!

01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:28.323
I'd rather drown.

01:10:30.453 --> 01:10:32.445
You can have your record.

01:10:34.416 --> 01:10:35.905
All right?

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:38.409
I said you can have your record.

01:10:42.588 --> 01:10:46.252
I'm sorry, Pinkie.
I don't know what come over me.

01:10:50.428 --> 01:10:52.671
What do you want me to say?

01:10:52.808 --> 01:10:54.639
Anything.

01:10:56.226 --> 01:10:58.057
Say something to me.

01:10:59.813 --> 01:11:01.302
All right.

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.283
You've asked me to make a record
in my voice.

01:11:26.754 --> 01:11:28.743
Well, here it is.

01:11:30.547 --> 01:11:33.005
What you want me to say is...

01:11:33.134 --> 01:11:34.964
..."I love you".

01:11:37.013 --> 01:11:38.842
But I don't.

01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:42.471
I hate you.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.262
I hate the way you look.

01:11:46.853 --> 01:11:48.844
I hate the way you talk.

01:11:49.565 --> 01:11:53.225
I hate everything about you.
You make me sick.

01:11:55.027 --> 01:11:56.689
Goddamn you, you little bitch,

01:11:56.821 --> 01:12:00.689
why don't you go back from wherever
you came from and leave me alone?

01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:12.827
We don't even have a record player.

01:12:18.757 --> 01:12:20.246
Don't touch me!

01:12:20.381 --> 01:12:23.123
If you fucking touch me,
I'll carve your fucking face.

01:12:23.258 --> 01:12:24.999
Where is he?

01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:30.010
- I asked for Colleoni.
- Mr Colleoni's occupied.

01:12:30.141 --> 01:12:32.927
Occupied? That's a nice word.

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.800
- Occupied.
- You're drunk.

01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:37.428
If you're looking for a job, forget it.

01:12:37.563 --> 01:12:41.307
What possible use could one
of Pinkie's boys be to Mr Colleoni?

01:12:41.442 --> 01:12:42.278
If you don't mind,

01:12:42.503 --> 01:12:45.277
- let's discuss this...
- Let's discuss it here.

01:12:45.822 --> 01:12:49.530
- Run along, Phil. This is woman's work.
- I don't like this, Ida.

01:12:49.659 --> 01:12:52.240
You don't have to like it.
You just have to let me get on with it.

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:56.031
Look, I'll be in the bar.
You need me, you know where I am.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:06.629
- ... I wanna see him now.
- He's with me.

01:13:10.466 --> 01:13:14.254
Couldn't help hearing just now...
You know Pinkie.

01:13:14.387 --> 01:13:16.050
- Pinkie?
- Yeah.

01:13:16.932 --> 01:13:19.765
- And you're a friend of...
- Pinkie's, yeah.

01:13:21.184 --> 01:13:23.221
- Are you thirsty?
- Yeah, that's it. Thirsty.

01:13:23.353 --> 01:13:25.969
- Whisky, sweetheart?
- Whisky.

01:13:26.106 --> 01:13:30.188
Could we have a couple of whiskies,
please? Make that large.

01:13:54.213 --> 01:13:57.126
- Take it or leave it.
- I'll tidy the place up tomorrow.

01:13:57.258 --> 01:13:59.340
Don't touch anything.

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:04.635
And for Christ's sake take that hat off.

01:14:09.769 --> 01:14:12.009
Well, you're staying, aren't you?

01:14:47.009 --> 01:14:48.998
You're scared.

01:14:51.681 --> 01:14:53.921
- Aren't you?
- Me?

01:16:27.972 --> 01:16:29.802
Poor old Spicer.

01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:37.385
You know, I can't see a stick
of Brighton rock without thinking...

01:16:40.025 --> 01:16:41.856
Carving's different.

01:16:42.777 --> 01:16:44.811
But Pinkie... he stops at nothing.

01:16:44.944 --> 01:16:47.027
Now, getting married...

01:16:48.656 --> 01:16:51.819
- Married? Who's getting married?
- Pinkie, of course.

01:16:52.745 --> 01:16:55.483
Who to? Not the girl from Snows?

01:16:55.619 --> 01:16:58.078
- Yeah, of course.
- Oh...

01:16:58.207 --> 01:16:59.697
Oh, the fool.

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:03.576
He's no fool.
No, he knows what's good for him.

01:17:04.546 --> 01:17:06.878
If she chose to say a thing or two...

01:17:09.089 --> 01:17:10.920
How did you know?

01:17:12.176 --> 01:17:13.257
I want some air.

01:17:13.386 --> 01:17:17.595
- It's stuffy in here.
- Don't rush off. Have another whisky.

01:17:17.725 --> 01:17:20.259
It's the central heating, you know.
It's not healthy.

01:17:20.392 --> 01:17:24.225
- Come on, sit next to me.
- I can only apologise.

01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:29.390
How much is it? There you go.

01:17:38.324 --> 01:17:40.655
Pinkie's lot. Where can I find them?

01:18:47.593 --> 01:18:49.254
"I love you, Pinkie.

01:18:49.386 --> 01:18:51.877
"I don't care what you do.
I love you forever.

01:18:53.223 --> 01:18:55.555
"Wherever you go, I go too. "

01:21:56.255 --> 01:21:57.748
Hi, kid.

01:21:58.591 --> 01:21:59.706
You got a visitor.

01:22:01.094 --> 01:22:03.506
- Who?
- Your mum.

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:11.507
You? They said my mother was here.

01:22:11.644 --> 01:22:13.886
Yeah, well,
I had to tell them something, didn't I?

01:22:16.441 --> 01:22:18.272
- I'll get Pinkie.
- Yeah, get him.

01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:20.357
I want a word with your Pinkie.

01:22:20.486 --> 01:22:24.818
- I don't let no-one bother Pinkie.
- He'll have plenty to bother him soon.

01:22:26.282 --> 01:22:28.272
He killed Frank Spicer.

01:22:28.408 --> 01:22:29.900
I know.

01:22:30.995 --> 01:22:34.203
- I know everything.
- Do you?

01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:37.538
Do you know that your precious Pinkie
battered Fred Hale to death?

01:22:37.666 --> 01:22:41.409
He choked Frank Spicer to death
with a stick of Brighton rock.

01:22:43.754 --> 01:22:46.668
- I need you to give evidence.
- Stay away from me.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.792
You're next in line, Rose.

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:50.499
No.

01:22:50.635 --> 01:22:52.877
Spicer knew about Hale,
so Pinkie killed him.

01:22:53.015 --> 01:22:56.346
You know about Hale and Spicer,
so why won't he kill you too?

01:22:56.475 --> 01:22:58.887
- He loves me.
- He doesn't.

01:22:59.019 --> 01:23:00.807
- He married me.
- Yeah.

01:23:00.938 --> 01:23:05.772
But only because they can't make a wife
give evidence against her own husband.

01:23:12.489 --> 01:23:14.821
Look, sweetheart...

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.572
...I only wanna help you.

01:23:18.704 --> 01:23:20.694
Stop saying that.

01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:26.414
I'll do anything.

01:23:28.794 --> 01:23:30.455
- Anything.
- That's more like it.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:33.080
You just leave us alone.

01:23:34.133 --> 01:23:36.622
All right. No need to get agitated.

01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:39.501
You're already an accessory.

01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:43.130
If they take Pinkie,
you think I care what happens to me?

01:23:44.682 --> 01:23:46.172
Oh...

01:23:52.775 --> 01:23:55.106
Well, I hope you're on the pill, love.

01:23:57.569 --> 01:23:59.981
You don't wanna have a murderer's baby.

01:24:17.169 --> 01:24:19.160
What the hell are you doing here?

01:24:20.341 --> 01:24:22.001
If you're bothering my girl...

01:24:22.134 --> 01:24:25.842
They can't force her to give evidence.
But she can volunteer.

01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:27.459
She won't.

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:31.179
She'll do whatever she pleases and
there's bugger all you can do about it.

01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:36.138
Because if you touch one hair
on that girl's head, there is nothing,

01:24:36.272 --> 01:24:41.514
nothing on this dear green earth
I will not do to make you suffer.

01:24:59.708 --> 01:25:02.539
- Her mum?
- Her mum, Pinkie.

01:25:03.293 --> 01:25:05.123
Did Rose say that?

01:25:05.252 --> 01:25:07.586
She ain't said nothing.

01:25:10.008 --> 01:25:11.840
We'll see.

01:25:36.403 --> 01:25:39.398
- Nice dress.
- You like it?

01:25:41.702 --> 01:25:43.534
I love it.

01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:46.611
Do another twirl.

01:25:52.336 --> 01:25:53.996
Pinkie?

01:25:54.127 --> 01:25:55.959
Yes, Rose?

01:25:59.884 --> 01:26:01.874
I done something awful.

01:26:03.387 --> 01:26:05.218
Go on.

01:26:06.931 --> 01:26:09.262
I took ten quid from the tin.

01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:12.384
I'll pay it back, I swear,
as soon as I get a job.

01:26:17.234 --> 01:26:19.315
Dallow says your mum's been.

01:26:26.658 --> 01:26:29.491
She ain't much of a mother, Pinkie.

01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:42.210
Only turns up when she wants something.

01:26:49.261 --> 01:26:51.501
She's been talking.

01:26:51.637 --> 01:26:53.127
Who to?

01:26:53.763 --> 01:26:55.754
To the tart who runs Snows.

01:26:57.141 --> 01:26:58.382
Hale's bird.

01:26:58.519 --> 01:27:01.306
If she's been talking,
then why not to the police?

01:27:01.437 --> 01:27:04.099
She said she'd never let me down.

01:27:04.232 --> 01:27:06.096
"Never, never, never. "

01:27:06.233 --> 01:27:07.769
She married you, didn't she?

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.063
If she loves me,
that would make it easier.

01:27:12.405 --> 01:27:14.489
She'd do anything I say.

01:27:30.087 --> 01:27:32.169
I could take her Hastings way...

01:27:36.342 --> 01:27:38.173
To the old lighthouse.

01:27:44.266 --> 01:27:46.258
I trust her.

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.675
All the way.

01:27:48.811 --> 01:27:51.473
I wouldn't trust anyone that far.

01:27:53.065 --> 01:27:55.056
Not even you, Dallow.

01:28:51.573 --> 01:28:53.565
If it was mine...

01:28:58.039 --> 01:29:01.371
If it was mine,
I wouldn't leave it alone all afternoon.

01:29:03.334 --> 01:29:05.166
It ain't yours.

01:29:07.631 --> 01:29:09.871
No, but it might be.

01:29:19.097 --> 01:29:21.090
Everything will be all right.

01:29:22.435 --> 01:29:24.266
Will it?

01:29:26.313 --> 01:29:28.144
I promise.

01:29:38.658 --> 01:29:41.898
Get dressed. I'm taking you out.

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.904
You look worried, Pinkie.

01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:51.280
No, I'm not worried.

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:54.415
I've got it all straight.

01:29:57.923 --> 01:30:00.163
In the box here.

01:30:53.428 --> 01:30:55.423
What do you wanna stop here for?

01:30:55.559 --> 01:30:57.592
It's where you brought me our
first night, remember?

01:30:58.559 --> 01:31:00.924
Nah, there's too many people here.

01:31:01.062 --> 01:31:02.722
We should get some air.

01:31:02.854 --> 01:31:06.471
We should go for a ride...
into the country.

01:31:06.609 --> 01:31:10.099
Can't we say goodbye to the pier first,
Pinkie?

01:31:11.404 --> 01:31:13.235
Goodbye?

01:31:15.825 --> 01:31:19.236
I lied to you... about my mum.

01:31:20.204 --> 01:31:24.491
I didn't want to, Pinkie, but...
She knows.

01:31:24.623 --> 01:31:27.367
Miss Arnold. About Fred Hale.

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.793
And Frank Spicer.

01:31:32.714 --> 01:31:35.795
I lied because I didn't want to
worry you, but then...

01:31:36.342 --> 01:31:39.800
I think maybe you should worry, Pinkie.
I think...

01:31:39.929 --> 01:31:42.168
I think maybe we should leave.

01:31:42.973 --> 01:31:44.464
Tonight.

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:46.591
Together.

01:31:49.938 --> 01:31:52.519
Do you believe me, Pinkie?

01:32:04.199 --> 01:32:06.815
Saw her coming, did you?

01:32:09.328 --> 01:32:12.281
I told you we should leave, Pinkie.
She'll never give up.

01:32:12.413 --> 01:32:13.862
I saw a ferret, out by the track once...

01:32:13.906 --> 01:32:16.407
Thought she'd blow your cover?

01:32:16.545 --> 01:32:19.159
- Is that why you confessed?
- Pinkie?

01:32:19.296 --> 01:32:21.957
Doesn't matter one way or another.
I was bound to find out. You knew it.

01:32:22.089 --> 01:32:24.251
All the time
you wondered how to cover your lie.

01:32:24.384 --> 01:32:27.338
My lie?
I told you I didn't want you to worry.

01:32:28.177 --> 01:32:31.922
- Get on.
- We've got to pack first, Pinkie.

01:32:33.308 --> 01:32:35.139
We ain't got time for that.

01:32:35.269 --> 01:32:37.179
You said so yourself.
She'll never give up.

01:32:37.311 --> 01:32:39.847
You saw a ferret once, out by the track.
Remember?

01:33:22.434 --> 01:33:24.141
Why are we stopping, Pinkie?

01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:27.852
You saw her on the pier.
She'll never give up.

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:30.311
She'll keep hounding us and hanging on.

01:33:30.439 --> 01:33:32.432
Waiting for us to slip up,
and one day it will happen.

01:33:32.567 --> 01:33:35.606
- And we'll be finished.
- She can't go on forever.

01:33:35.738 --> 01:33:38.570
Yes, she can. People don't change.

01:33:38.698 --> 01:33:40.188
It's like a stick of rock.

01:33:40.325 --> 01:33:43.656
Bite it all the way down,
you still read "Brighton".

01:33:46.163 --> 01:33:47.403
Read it.

01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:52.832
"I love you, Pinkie.

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:57.494
"I don't care what you do.
I love you forever.

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.923
"Wherever you go, I go too. "

01:34:08.683 --> 01:34:10.672
- You mean that, don't you?
- Of course I do.

01:34:10.809 --> 01:34:13.050
Every word? With all your heart?

01:34:19.065 --> 01:34:21.558
Well, do you mean it Or don't you?

01:34:23.737 --> 01:34:25.228
- Can't we wait?
- Wait?

01:34:25.365 --> 01:34:28.026
Till what? Till it's too late?

01:34:28.909 --> 01:34:32.900
Remember, Rose,
what you said to me outside the caff?

01:34:33.703 --> 01:34:35.489
You said you'd never let me down.

01:34:36.708 --> 01:34:38.867
Never, never, never.

01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:48.793
- Bell, a double rum.
- Yep.

01:34:55.891 --> 01:34:58.426
Cubitt's been arrested
on his way to the port.

01:34:58.558 --> 01:35:02.392
It's only a matter of time before
he tells the police what he told me.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.978
- Where's that girl?
- How should I know?

01:35:05.107 --> 01:35:07.017
You're the one
who put the fear of God up him.

01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:10.232
They was fine till you showed up.
He was sweet on her.

01:35:11.195 --> 01:35:13.151
It's your meddling
that's tipped him over.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.521
Anything that happens to that girl,
I blame you.

01:35:34.464 --> 01:35:36.876
I've put up the safety.

01:35:37.008 --> 01:35:39.499
All you have to do is pull the trigger.

01:35:40.055 --> 01:35:41.668
It isn't hard.

01:35:44.016 --> 01:35:47.257
Put it in your ear.
That'll hold it steady.

01:35:48.018 --> 01:35:49.097
Go on.

01:35:50.728 --> 01:35:52.218
Take it.

01:36:08.494 --> 01:36:10.485
Fuck's sake!

01:36:13.375 --> 01:36:16.707
Now, you know where he's taken her
and I can guess what for.

01:36:16.836 --> 01:36:20.247
So, if you want to keep out of trouble,
you let me into this car.

01:36:20.379 --> 01:36:22.165
Who... Shit!

01:36:28.596 --> 01:36:30.176
What if I don't shoot?

01:36:31.848 --> 01:36:33.588
Then I'll shoot myself.
Want me to do it first?

01:36:33.725 --> 01:36:35.214
No.

01:36:47.195 --> 01:36:49.025
It won't hurt, Rose.

01:36:50.823 --> 01:36:52.312
I promise.

01:37:02.833 --> 01:37:04.243
Do you love me, Pinkie?

01:37:12.133 --> 01:37:14.291
We wouldn't be together, would we?

01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:17.505
Not if they hang me...

01:37:17.638 --> 01:37:20.050
...and you have to go on without me.

01:37:42.491 --> 01:37:44.323
That's it.

01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:52.452
There! There they are!

01:37:59.549 --> 01:38:01.038
Rose!

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.007
- Rose.
- Dallow!

01:38:03.136 --> 01:38:06.173
- Come here. Get in the car.
- It's no use, Pinkie.

01:38:06.305 --> 01:38:08.294
They got Cubitt.

01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:10.217
- Pinkie!
- You come with me.

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.182
Get in the car.

01:39:13.029 --> 01:39:14.518
Pinkie!

01:39:19.284 --> 01:39:20.774
Pinkie.

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.162
- Pinkie!
- Oh!

01:39:27.291 --> 01:39:29.282
Pinkie!

01:39:30.461 --> 01:39:31.668
Pinkie.

01:39:46.558 --> 01:39:49.343
Come on, Rose. Come on, darling.

01:39:49.476 --> 01:39:52.310
Come on, Rose. Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.

01:39:52.438 --> 01:39:55.681
- No.
- Come away. Take her, Dallow.

01:39:55.816 --> 01:39:57.351
- Come on, sweetheart.
- No!

01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:36.339
What about the girl?

01:40:37.478 --> 01:40:38.967
Oh...

01:40:39.645 --> 01:40:41.637
Poor little kid.

01:40:43.192 --> 01:40:45.522
She thought he was in love with her.

01:40:46.859 --> 01:40:49.147
And was he?

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.190
In love?

01:40:51.321 --> 01:40:53.152
What difference would that make?

01:40:53.283 --> 01:40:56.947
Well, it would show...
there was some good.

01:40:57.079 --> 01:40:58.113
Oh, Phil...

01:41:00.872 --> 01:41:02.612
I think it's a bleeding miracle

01:41:02.749 --> 01:41:07.286
that nature should have planted love
in every man jack of us, Ida.

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:11.414
And every woman.

01:41:12.509 --> 01:41:14.840
Even though in some of us...

01:41:15.387 --> 01:41:17.797
...it's as useless as an appendix.

01:41:27.978 --> 01:41:29.970
Oh, I'm sorry, Ida.

01:41:30.982 --> 01:41:33.143
No, no, you're right, Phil.

01:41:41.116 --> 01:41:42.355
Let's celebrate.

01:41:44.661 --> 01:41:48.324
Well... Shall I get us
a bottle of champagne?

01:41:48.457 --> 01:41:50.491
Yes! Get us a bottle of champagne.

01:41:50.622 --> 01:41:52.363
And a room.

01:41:57.338 --> 01:42:00.377
Blimey. Talk about miracles.

01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.427
- It's expensive.
- I'll settle it.

01:42:07.556 --> 01:42:10.637
- No, a man likes to...
- Trust me, Phil.

01:42:12.352 --> 01:42:14.433
I know what a man likes.

01:42:47.592 --> 01:42:49.832
Go on, open it!

01:42:51.803 --> 01:42:53.714
I don't care what anyone says.

01:42:57.807 --> 01:42:59.422
You don't know a thing about love.

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.303
How can you persist in this delusion,
child,

01:43:04.438 --> 01:43:06.928
after what he tried to do to you?

01:43:11.984 --> 01:43:14.068
I should have pulled the trigger.

01:43:18.867 --> 01:43:20.949
I don't want your absolution.

01:43:24.538 --> 01:43:26.701
I wanna be with Pinkie.

01:43:26.834 --> 01:43:30.245
- Go on, open it!
- What is going on over here?

01:43:31.042 --> 01:43:34.079
Get back to your beds, girls.

01:43:34.212 --> 01:43:37.331
The package is to be opened
in an orderly manner.

01:43:38.092 --> 01:43:40.254
Believe in all that crap, do you?

01:43:41.054 --> 01:43:43.294
Course I do.

01:43:44.847 --> 01:43:46.338
Course there's a hell.

01:43:47.434 --> 01:43:49.422
What about heaven?

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.721
Saints?

01:43:50.854 --> 01:43:52.686
Miracles?

01:43:55.483 --> 01:43:56.561
Miracles?

01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:03.644
Maybe.

01:45:33.734 --> 01:45:36.645
"You've asked me to make a record
in my voice.

01:45:39.279 --> 01:45:41.109
"Well, here it is.

01:45:42.952 --> 01:45:45.407
"What you want me to say is...

01:45:45.536 --> 01:45:47.528
"... 'I love you'.

01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:52.781
"... 'I love you'.

01:45:53.793 --> 01:45:55.283
"... 'I love you'.

01:45:56.168 --> 01:45:57.661
"... 'I love you'.

01:45:58.675 --> 01:46:00.164
"... 'I love you'.

01:46:01.092 --> 01:46:02.581
"... 'I love you'.

01:46:03.552 --> 01:46:05.042
"... 'I love you'.

01:46:05.929 --> 01:46:07.418
"... 'I love you'.
