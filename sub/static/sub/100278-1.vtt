00:35.069 --> 00:36.335
Oh, what a drag.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.138
I'm being on featured on "Cops"
twice.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.687
Kissy ass, it's
too hard.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.572
- Damn, she's a mad slut.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.440
Ooh.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.484
- Oof, ah.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.315
- No.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.413
What the?

03:00.414 --> 03:02.648
Ow!

03:08.355 --> 03:09.688
- Hey.
- Get out.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.423
- And we've got action.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.014
Oh, you stupid fucker.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.524
And so it begins.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.540
Surprise.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.512
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.683
Rise and shine?

06:27.121 --> 06:28.520
Yeah, no good.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.490
I hate wakey wakey and
rise and shine, too.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.891
There's really no good
phrase to start the morning

06:32.893 --> 06:34.760
unless you're a morning person.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.895
I guess you'd be fine
with any old greeting.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.032
You a morning person, Brad?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.367
Don't need an alarm clock,

06:42.368 --> 06:43.701
you just wake up with a gleam in
your eye

06:43.704 --> 06:46.471
and a pep in your step,
ready for a brand new day?

06:46.473 --> 06:49.508
Yeah, I bet you're one of those
people.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.146
Not this guy, though,
am I right?

06:54.148 --> 06:55.514
Needs his beauty sleep.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.689
Isn't that right, Dylan?

07:04.691 --> 07:06.558
You need a good nine to 10

07:06.560 --> 07:08.560
hours before you start your day?

07:12.466 --> 07:13.732
- Help!

07:13.734 --> 07:15.467
- Uh, help!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.536
¶ Help! ¶

07:18.939 --> 07:21.807
Come on, we almost had a
good harmony going there.

07:21.809 --> 07:22.741
That was nice.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.677
Yell all you want.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.747
There ain't nobody out
there but us chickens.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.850
- What the fuck?

07:32.686 --> 07:35.887
- Yes indeed, what the fuck.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.856
That is the question.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.724
So glad you finally asked.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.976
- Yeah, what the fuck?

07:40.977 --> 07:42.227
- Yeah, the question's
already been established

07:42.229 --> 07:43.462
by your buddy here.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.164
- What the fuck?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.166
- It's been established.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.102
- What the, what the fuck is
this?

07:53.707 --> 07:56.608
- So here's your "what the
fuck."

07:56.610 --> 08:01.513
You're both gonna help me
answer a really big question.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.515
You've been selected to be a
part

08:03.517 --> 08:07.085
of a truly important study, an
experiment.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.756
Oh, my
God, I'm so sorry, Dylan.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.925
I knew that words like
experiment or study

08:13.927 --> 08:15.560
would make you agitated.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.728
- Fuck you, bitch.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.798
- Good one.

08:22.669 --> 08:27.739
I won't use words like
study or experiment anymore.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.675
We're gonna play a little game.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.644
- Holy shit, what is this?

08:32.645 --> 08:33.745
- Oh, shit, what?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.515
- My legs, I can't feel my legs.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.717
What did you do to my legs?

08:39.720 --> 08:40.952
- Yeah, what did you do to my
legs?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.562
- Okay now, everybody just calm
down.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.564
You're asking a lot of
questions, and rightfully so,

08:52.566 --> 08:55.000
but we've gotta have some order

08:55.002 --> 08:57.102
if anything's gonna get done
around here.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.271
You haven't even given me a
chance

08:59.273 --> 09:00.805
to address your concerns.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.641
- Well then, start answering,
you bitch.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.109
- Yeah, bitch.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.146
- God, he's so much worse than I
imagined.

09:10.951 --> 09:11.983
- What's your deal?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.757
- Let's get on the same
page here, shall we?

09:19.860 --> 09:22.561
Very good, now.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.965
Ask me a question, just one.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.168
- Who are you, like for real?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.102
- Yeah.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.022
- I'm your abductor.

09:34.023 --> 09:36.140
- Great, and what should
we call our abductor?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.110
Sorry, abductress.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.180
- General rule to live by,

09:42.182 --> 09:45.216
when going to a bar and
trying to take a girl home,

09:45.218 --> 09:47.018
it might be considered rude

09:47.020 --> 09:49.688
to not even have a clue
as to what her name is.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.924
- You were taking us to your
place.

09:55.896 --> 10:00.599
- My name's Meg, but that's not
important.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.666
Next question.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.668
- Where are we?

10:03.670 --> 10:07.706
- Deep end of an empty pool
in an empty neighborhood.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.742
Next question.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.812
- Which neighborhood, where?

10:14.848 --> 10:15.780
- Not important.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.083
- Fucking bitch.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.753
- Do go on.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.056
- What is this?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.959
- A study, an experiment.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.194
I already told you that.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.131
- Ask her if she'll let us go.

10:35.636 --> 10:39.938
- Have you, have you maimed me,
maimed us?

10:41.742 --> 10:42.741
Will I walk again?

10:44.978 --> 10:49.381
Oh God, no

10:53.286 --> 10:55.086
No, no, no, I didn't maim you.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.722
I, this isn't one of those long
stings.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.058
In fact, let's just say
that we'll be done with this

11:00.060 --> 11:03.328
by the time the sun drops
behind that hill over there.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.764
We'll be done one way or
another.

11:05.766 --> 11:09.401
That much I promise you, next?

11:11.371 --> 11:12.303
- Why?

11:16.677 --> 11:18.343
Fancy Pants!

11:21.715 --> 11:22.747
- And?

11:22.749 --> 11:23.682
- Know him?

11:24.951 --> 11:25.950
- Sure, Aaron.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.219
- Orin.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.055
- Orin, whatever, so what?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.124
- And who is Orin to you, Brad?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.359
- He's a kid at school.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.796
- Who is Orin to the two of you?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.031
- He's just some kid.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.268
- Just some kid?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.339
In the interest of brevity

11:48.341 --> 11:49.974
and moving this soiree right
along,

11:49.976 --> 11:53.745
I'm gonna read some brief and
blatantly painful excerpts

11:53.747 --> 11:55.113
from Orin's journal.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.282
Who the fuck keeps a journal

12:00.120 --> 12:02.854
- October 8th, last year.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.823
My ear continues to ring
from the punch I took

12:04.825 --> 12:06.057
from Dylan in the hall today.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.258
December 5th, last year.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.461
Brad and his bulldog, Dylan,

12:09.463 --> 12:10.929
are transferred out of my gym
glass.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.397
This is big news for me as it
means

12:12.399 --> 12:15.266
I won't be tortured after
lunch on the regular anymore.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.102
December 13th, this year.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.004
I miss being able to schedule
my abuse and humiliation.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.507
Now that Brad and the animal
are no longer in my gym class,

12:22.509 --> 12:24.476
they find me whenever they
can throughout the day.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.511
I never know when the attacks
are coming.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.780
Once I graduate and move
on from this hellhole,

12:28.782 --> 12:30.632
they will, too.

12:30.633 --> 12:32.483
I'm sure they'll learn to mask
their hatred to an extent,

12:32.486 --> 12:33.418
but they'll still be out there,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.153
as others will like them.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.887
They'll always find ways
to scourge the undeserving

12:36.890 --> 12:38.356
and make lives miserable in
their wake.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.891
I really don't see an end.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.193
No light at the end of this
tunnel.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.504
Dude's
obsessed with us.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.073
- Where exactly was the
brevity in all of that?

12:55.075 --> 12:56.875
- Yeah, brevity.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.460
What is that?

12:58.461 --> 13:00.044
- Pretty long-winded and
dramatic, if you ask me.

13:01.047 --> 13:01.980
- I didn't.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.421
Do you think that homosexuality
is a choice, Brad?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.422
- A choice?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.124
- Yeah.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.825
Do people choose to be gay, or
don't they?

13:15.862 --> 13:18.062
- We've all got free will, so
yeah.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.998
I guess it's totally a choice.

13:20.967 --> 13:21.900
- Right.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.269
Let me ask you this, Brad.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.005
Think your parents are proud?

13:28.441 --> 13:31.042
Parents, older sister?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.310
Two older sisters, right?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.213
- Stalker.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.048
It's not the first time some
chick

13:37.050 --> 13:38.082
has stalked me.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.151
- Ugh, get over yourself.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.519
Think they're proud?

13:42.989 --> 13:45.123
- Yeah, I'd like to think so.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.958
- Yeah, I bet they're proud.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.161
Bet your mom and dad, older
sisters Susan and Judy,

13:50.163 --> 13:53.231
are so proud of their
all-American son,

13:53.233 --> 13:55.366
little brother, making his way

13:55.368 --> 13:57.602
through the high school ranks so
amicably.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.071
- You could say that.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.309
- What about you?

14:04.311 --> 14:05.844
- What about me?

14:05.846 --> 14:10.982
- No siblings, no dad to
make him proud or look up to.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.219
Had to go find a chum to follow
at school.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.620
- I don't follow shit!

14:17.224 --> 14:18.857
- Is homosexuality a choice?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.195
- Yeah, it is.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.865
- No siblings, raised by your
grandma,

14:26.867 --> 14:28.032
with a double-digit IQ.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.236
Must be so difficult for you.

14:31.238 --> 14:35.139
- Yeah, well, fuck you.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.411
- Something that's always
made so little sense to me

14:40.413 --> 14:42.297
about people like you

14:42.298 --> 14:44.182
is your absolute opposition
to people of color,

14:44.184 --> 14:45.283
religion hooking up,

14:45.285 --> 14:47.352
but when it comes to the sexes,

14:47.354 --> 14:49.487
they have to be opposite
by their very definition.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.589
- So now, we're bigots, too?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.057
Hey, don't listen to her.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.225
She's trying to mind fuck you,

14:54.227 --> 14:55.660
trying to mind fuck the both of
us.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.662
Don't know why yet, but
that's what she's doing.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.065
- Dylan asked me if was
the Mayor of Queertown

15:01.067 --> 15:02.133
before slapping me across
the face in the quad.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.138
Brad and Dylan followed
me to my car, got in,

15:07.140 --> 15:09.407
and demanded that I take
them to the liquor store.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.175
I did, and they adhered rainbow
stickers

15:11.177 --> 15:13.177
all over my windows as I drove
them there.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.347
I can't peel them off without
tearing my window tint.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.250
Brad held me down and spit in my
mouth.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.418
- All right, all right.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.287
So we had some fun with this
guy.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.055
Normal high school stuff.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.523
It happens every day.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.691
What's it to you?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.993
Is he your little brother or
some shit?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.934
Great, so we fucked with
your little brother.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.335
So what, it happens.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.203
Shit like that happens.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.406
Doesn't mean you go out and
capture,

15:41.408 --> 15:44.075
you kidnap people and tie them
up

15:44.077 --> 15:45.727
like you're part of some kind

15:45.728 --> 15:47.378
of underground military
operation.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.048
Plus being his sister,
I bet you have an idea

15:50.050 --> 15:52.183
of what an insufferable prick he
can be.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.319
I'm gonna ask you again,

15:54.321 --> 15:56.988
what the fuck do you want from
us?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.556
- Yeah, just tell us what you
want,

15:58.558 --> 16:00.158
and we'll give it to
you, anything you want.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.659
- Shut your fucking face.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.593
- Sorry, Brad.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.231
- We won't give her anything she
wants.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.433
We won't give her shit.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.236
- Right, nothin' is what she'll
get.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.706
We won't give you shit

16:17.143 --> 16:21.346
Tell me, Dylan, do
you know what a hate crime is?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.715
- Of course I do.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.150
And now you're doing this to us,

16:26.152 --> 16:29.654
so this is a hate hate crime
crime.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.557
You're hate hate crime criming
us.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.463
- That checks out, that actually
works.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.431
This is a hate hate crime crime,

16:40.433 --> 16:43.334
because you hate hate
crimes, and this is a crime.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.235
- Totally.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.639
You done?

16:51.711 --> 16:54.512
Orin was always a really
smart kid, you know.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.483
When he decided to do it,

16:58.485 --> 17:01.719
he knew not to do it like
they do in the movies.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.056
You know, east to west.

17:06.492 --> 17:10.494
Instead, he dragged the blade
southbound,

17:11.297 --> 17:12.463
parallel to the vein.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.200
What would you say if I told
you this was your fault?

17:19.305 --> 17:21.172
- Again, what do you want from
us?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.275
- I'm gonna give you the
opportunity

17:24.277 --> 17:26.077
to test your theory.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.444
You know, very few theorists
ever get

17:27.446 --> 17:29.864
the opportunity to do that,

17:29.865 --> 17:32.282
but you guys are gonna prove
or disprove your theory

17:32.285 --> 17:33.818
that you have so much faith in.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.654
And by doing so,

17:36.655 --> 17:38.488
you'll also be helping me
with my thesis project.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.757
Isn't that great?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.692
- What's the bitch talking about
now?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.327
- No idea.

17:43.329 --> 17:47.532
- Brad, Dylan, you two
aren't going anywhere

17:47.534 --> 17:49.100
until you prove to me,

17:49.736 --> 17:51.335
for our audience over there,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.806
that sexual proclivity is a
choice.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.458
- What's that mean?

17:57.459 --> 17:59.309
What the fuck is this
crazy bitch talking about?

18:04.150 --> 18:05.817
- I think she wants us to have
sex.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.585
- Fuck that, with her?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.352
No way, I'd never touch that
skank.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.589
- Logistically speaking, that
would be damn near impossible,

18:11.591 --> 18:13.858
given your bondage and whatnot.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.127
- Not her, Dyl.

18:18.131 --> 18:18.863
- Then what?

18:22.235 --> 18:25.336
Oh, you mean, me and you?

18:25.338 --> 18:28.639
She wants you and me to fuck
each other?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.809
Well, I'd have big problems with
that.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.747
- What I have in store
for you is much more fun.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.868
See that one over there?

18:40.869 --> 18:42.452
That one's you, streamed live.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.490
And this one over here, that's
you,

18:45.492 --> 18:47.658
also streaming live.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.759
Wave hello.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.862
Oh, I forgot, you can't.

18:50.864 --> 18:53.464
Well, nod or something, don't be
rude.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.535
And don't worry about the word
live here.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.437
Yes, they're both live,

18:59.438 --> 19:01.338
but nobody's been alerted
to their existence yet.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.274
It's just, you know, floating
around there on the internet.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.143
It's like a bunch of other dumb
shit.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.813
Right now, they're live for
the sake of documentation.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.648
So nothing to worry about.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.851
- Sure, why would we worry
about that minor detail?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.219
- No, I'm serious.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.576
I've got a guy who's really good

19:16.577 --> 19:17.932
with the whole face-blurring
thing,

19:17.933 --> 19:19.288
so if you play your cards right,

19:19.292 --> 19:21.659
you can keep your anonymity

19:21.661 --> 19:24.162
even if this study
garners any recognition.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.669
Oh, over here.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.709
Just hold that thought,

19:38.711 --> 19:41.312
and I will be right back.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.188
Well, this is fuckin'
weird.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.924
Totally, but boobs,
right?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.360
I think I got a
concussion.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.829
Uh, like drugs?

19:58.831 --> 19:59.764
No.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.600
Oh, fuck.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.603
Is that your neck?

20:05.605 --> 20:06.604
I think so.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.373
I thought it was your
nose.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.942
You can see?

20:10.944 --> 20:12.276
Yeah, I see
black, what about you?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.544
Oh, you fuckin' idiot.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.946
I fuckin' hate you so much.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.714
What, I'm
telling you what I see.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.282
Just leave me alone.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.284
Why are you being like
this?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.354
Listen, shut up.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.388
- Sorry about that.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.226
Now, where were we, oh, yes.

20:28.928 --> 20:33.898
Mysterious third stream, ah.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.499
- Where'd you just go?

20:35.501 --> 20:39.237
- Not important, but the third
stream is.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.938
Where could it be, what could it
be?

20:40.940 --> 20:43.908
What, you're not even curious?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.344
Sorry, I'm having way too much
fun.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.779
Ah, it's a classic case
of trickle-down abuse.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.281
- I'm not playing your game.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.550
- It's like when the
victim becomes the bully,

20:52.552 --> 20:53.884
and then they relish in it way
too much,

20:53.886 --> 20:55.653
except for I'm the de facto
victim

20:55.654 --> 20:57.421
because the actual
victim's in the hospital.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.825
Anyway, third stream
is coming from a camera

21:00.827 --> 21:04.662
that sits right down there.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.332
Don't you kinda wanna see it?

21:08.334 --> 21:09.500
- Yes, show us.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.374
Fuck is that, whore?

21:16.376 --> 21:17.942
What the fuck is that?

21:17.944 --> 21:21.012
Care to see?

21:21.014 --> 21:23.981
All you have to do is look
right down, it's right there.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.760
Fantastic, isn't it?

21:39.899 --> 21:44.302
All you two have to do to
get out of here is make

21:44.304 --> 21:49.373
this little bell here chime.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.711
And I've got it rigged so that,
let's say,

21:53.713 --> 21:56.314
when you two meet,

21:57.617 --> 21:59.417
then it'll lift off of its
platform,

21:59.419 --> 22:01.786
and we'll hear its sweet little
bell.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.487
But the catch is,

22:03.489 --> 22:06.324
it has to be both members
and at the same time.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.792
You both following this?

22:07.794 --> 22:11.362
- No, members, what's
she talking about now?

22:11.364 --> 22:13.497
Who's a member, member of what?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.366
- Do you want to explain
it to him, or should I?

22:17.537 --> 22:18.569
Your dicks, honey.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.471
We're talkin' about your dicks.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.340
Need you to get a boner, a hard
on,

22:22.342 --> 22:24.709
a stiffy, wood, hard weiner.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.445
We need you to do this
at the same time together

22:27.447 --> 22:28.913
while looking into each other's
eyes

22:28.915 --> 22:30.748
because if homosexuality is a
choice,

22:30.750 --> 22:33.451
like you two have claimed it
to be over and over again,

22:33.453 --> 22:37.555
then this shouldn't be too hard
, difficult,

22:37.557 --> 22:38.889
shouldn't be too difficult.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.593
By the way, this was no easy
task

22:42.595 --> 22:44.762
as the difference in length and
girth

22:44.764 --> 22:47.598
between you two is quite
significant.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.037
Sorry, Brad, your buddy
here puts you to shame.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.740
- I've got a big dick?

22:56.976 --> 22:58.676
Is she sayin' I got a big dick?

23:00.580 --> 23:03.748
- Shall we begin with phase
one of the experiment?

23:03.750 --> 23:07.651
- Oh God, I'm sorry, I got
nervous.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.053
- My, my.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.454
- Sorry, bro, I get
bones when I get nervous,

23:10.456 --> 23:11.372
it just happens.

23:11.373 --> 23:12.289
I guess now is as good

23:12.290 --> 23:13.206
a time as any, you wanna
tell him, or should I?

23:13.207 --> 23:14.123
- Tell him what?

23:14.127 --> 23:15.293
- What, tell who what?

23:15.294 --> 23:16.460
- If you don't tell
him, I'm gonna tell him.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.862
- Okay, okay, I'll tell him.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.765
I always get boners when I'm
nervous.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.066
I suspected this
would happen at some point,

23:22.068 --> 23:24.135
but I didn't expect it
to happen so quickly.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.870
- When I get scared, it just
pops up.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.805
It just happens.

23:27.806 --> 23:29.739
- Truth is, when you get
nervous or you get scared,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.676
your heart flutters.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.611
You know, the whole fight
or flight syndrome thing.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.579
This makes getting an
erection nearly impossible.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.681
- Why the fuck is your dick
hard?

23:37.683 --> 23:39.750
- This is a different kind of
excitement.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.751
- This is fuckin' brutal.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.420
- Well, I've got some good news,

23:42.422 --> 23:43.888
and I've got some bad news.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.090
Good news is, you guys are half
way there.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.859
Brad just needs to chub up,
and you guys are good to go.

23:48.861 --> 23:53.864
Bad news is, turns out Dylan's
one of those awful people.

23:53.866 --> 23:57.001
You know, you hear about it all
the time.

23:57.003 --> 24:00.905
Politicians, CEOs, priests.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.040
Usually people in a power
position.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.944
They repress their own sexual
desires

24:06.946 --> 24:08.746
and instead turn it into
aggressive acts

24:08.748 --> 24:12.149
toward others that have similar
inclinations to their own.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.621
Didn't have to do much
searching to find out

24:17.623 --> 24:19.557
that your buddy here is clearly
gay.

24:20.526 --> 24:21.492
Always has been.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.695
- You're a fag?

24:26.248 --> 24:27.798
- She's lying, I love chicks.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.069
- So cowardly, just looking
at that clueless face

24:32.071 --> 24:35.039
makes me ponder the mistakes of
evolution.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.174
Hell, I'd be real hard pressed

24:37.176 --> 24:39.743
not to get super sadistic on you
right now

24:39.745 --> 24:41.479
if you weren't so goddamn slow.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.147
Sad, really.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.954
- Holy fuck, I can feel it
touching me,

24:49.956 --> 24:51.255
and it's getting bigger.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.958
- Told you he was a big boy.
- Oh, my God.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.760
Anyway, should we get back
at the task at hand, guys?

24:59.565 --> 25:04.568
Oh, poor thing, you look awfully
thirsty.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.243
- Get the fuck away.
- Want some water?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.046
How about you, Dylan?

25:16.048 --> 25:17.781
- I've got the opposite problem.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.118
- Okay, give me some of that.

25:23.256 --> 25:24.889
Oh, you fucking bitch.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.658
- Ask nicely.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.025
- Please give me some water.

25:29.829 --> 25:30.861
- Good, Baby Bird.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.697
I've got to take a
leak.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.700
- I put a hole in your
sleeve, just let 'er rip.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.542
- Dude, you're pissin' on my
dick!

25:44.544 --> 25:46.143
- Sorry, bro, couldn't help it.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.845
- Get me the fuck, what the
fuck,

25:47.847 --> 25:49.447
get me the fuck out of this.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.048
- Calm down, it's just
urine, it's sterile.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.249
- I don't like it.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.551
- Hm, I don't blame you,

25:53.553 --> 25:54.752
but you know what?

25:54.754 --> 25:55.953
Sooner we get to it,

25:55.954 --> 25:57.153
the sooner you two can get out
of here.

25:57.156 --> 26:00.024
So I'll give you two the full
hour

26:00.026 --> 26:02.760
to complete this simple little
task.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.451
It's a choice, after all,

26:04.452 --> 26:06.141
so it should be pretty simple.

26:06.142 --> 26:07.831
Just choose to like each other
sexually.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.200
Brad, it's all up to you.

26:12.605 --> 26:15.039
- All right, I'll play, what the
fuck.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.846
So you handled me?

26:22.848 --> 26:24.381
Really got your hands all up on
me,

26:24.382 --> 26:25.915
getting my dick into
that absurd contraption.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.120
- It's not how this works.

26:30.122 --> 26:33.090
Each other, you have to choose
each other.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.026
If I don't hear the
tingling of this little bell

26:36.028 --> 26:38.128
in one hour's time,

26:38.129 --> 26:40.229
then we're gonna have
to move on to stage two.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.634
- What's stage two?

26:43.636 --> 26:45.769
- Oh, stage two is forced.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.104
Yeah, at stage two, I'm gonna
release

26:47.106 --> 26:49.590
a whole bunch of new pictures

26:49.591 --> 26:52.075
and show everybody about your
recently acquired interests.

26:53.746 --> 26:58.248
Well, Brad's recently acquired
interests.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.883
- I'm just nervous.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.623
- I'll leave you guys to get to
it.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.858
Give you some alone time.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.135
Found this little baby inside
the house.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.372
It's amazing what some
people will abandon.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.808
This cut runs about a half hour,

27:27.095 --> 27:28.411
just to give you an
idea of where you're at.

27:31.384 --> 27:33.651
One hour, then we share.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.998
Time's up, bitches.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.101
Let's see what we got.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.770
Dylan's still strong like bull,

28:59.772 --> 29:02.372
and Brad is not so much.

29:03.476 --> 29:04.408
- Whatever.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.879
- Subject D shows visible signs

29:08.881 --> 29:10.147
of continued excitement by means

29:10.149 --> 29:11.348
of a healthy and prolonged
erection

29:11.350 --> 29:13.050
at the one hour and six minute
mark,

29:13.052 --> 29:16.086
while Subject B remains
flaccid and sexually dormant.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.891
Okay, well, time to post the
latest.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.396
And post and publish.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.773
Always gotta stay current
with your latest updates.

29:35.775 --> 29:39.009
- And you really think anyone
would take this seriously

29:39.011 --> 29:41.145
with a Chinese dick trap

29:41.147 --> 29:43.380
at the center of your little
experiment?

29:44.216 --> 29:45.783
- Yeah, I do.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.251
I think that the smart people

29:47.253 --> 29:49.236
will see the bigger picture,

29:49.237 --> 29:51.220
and that's your friend's
dick at the moment.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.958
So on to phase two.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.026
Phase two's a little bit longer,

29:56.028 --> 29:58.362
but with newer consequences.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.229
- What now, bitch?

29:59.231 --> 30:00.831
- Good one, again.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.401
Next step is physical.

30:04.403 --> 30:07.371
So if you don't make the right
choice,

30:08.908 --> 30:10.574
you're both gonna lose
something.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.508
- Oh, God.

30:23.022 --> 30:27.391
- And what would you do
if you had that knife?

30:27.393 --> 30:29.159
Don't you worry about
that rusty old thing.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.028
It won't come into play here.

30:31.030 --> 30:34.031
But I will give you a
sneak peek into what will.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.269
I'm really good with
knots, all kinds of knots.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.137
Dad was a seaman.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.071
Semen.

30:45.411 --> 30:48.512
- So you got your basic Figure
Eight,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.215
Alpine Butterfly,

30:53.085 --> 30:56.320
and then there's the
Constrictor.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.923
- Where'd you even get that?

30:59.925 --> 31:02.492
- Fun fact, see this flimsy,

31:02.494 --> 31:04.995
nearly invisible piece of
string?

31:04.997 --> 31:07.464
It can do just as much
damage as that there knife.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.301
(String zipping

31:12.204 --> 31:13.136
- Oh.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.374
- I'll leave these here for
motivation.

31:22.081 --> 31:25.315
- I can't, I just, I can't do
it.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.516
- He's trying.

31:31.156 --> 31:32.089
- Sorry.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.175
- It's not nearly as fun

31:52.177 --> 31:53.577
as I thought it would be.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.145
Kind of pathetic, actually.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.282
Yeah, it's just like you said.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.583
One guy broke almost
immediately,

31:59.585 --> 32:01.685
and the other one's totally
devastated.

32:01.687 --> 32:05.022
But you can see that yourself.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.396
Yeah, if I
didn't know any better,

32:12.398 --> 32:14.131
I'd feel kind of bad, actually.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.203
I'll be right here until
I'm not anymore.

32:27.212 --> 32:28.178
Oh, shit.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.082
Oh.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.417
Really?

32:47.733 --> 32:50.400
These fake IDs
are gonna get us laid.

32:50.402 --> 32:51.635
All right.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.636
Why are we traveling
all the way across town

32:52.638 --> 32:53.854
just to hunt cougars?

32:53.855 --> 32:55.071
- 'Cause the bartender doesn't
look up

32:55.074 --> 32:56.039
when he checks your ID.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.107
Just stares at his phone.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.009
- Yeah, really, fuck yeah, dude.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.444
Your regimen.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.113
Now, you can look every day as a
Friday.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.047
- What is that?

33:04.049 --> 33:06.316
- It's a cougar's man.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.584
- Cougar's man, just
like females, but older.

33:08.587 --> 33:09.942
Cougars.

33:09.943 --> 33:11.298
Well, you
can make that a reality

33:11.299 --> 33:12.654
at the Coke Company Limited.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.025
With our gel coma-inducing
technology--

33:15.995 --> 33:17.227
- You ready?

33:17.229 --> 33:18.261
- Hell, yeah, let's go.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.531
Yeah.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.150
Kick some ass.

33:23.151 --> 33:24.768
You can choose
anything here to be your--

33:24.770 --> 33:26.703
- Bye, grandma, be home
whenever.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.388
For the next 20
minutes,

33:28.389 --> 33:30.072
our trained deep slumber
specialists are--

33:30.075 --> 33:32.776
Wow, you're
grandma's so not a cougar.

33:32.778 --> 33:33.710
- Are these?

33:48.260 --> 33:51.161
- We have made it, my friend,
we're in.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.704
- Hey, Dylan, stop acting odd.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.805
You'll get us busted.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.490
Just drink your drink,

34:03.491 --> 34:05.174
and keep your eyes peeled for
some dimes.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.643
- Dimes, right.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.760
- Boom, found one.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.395
And she looks interested,

34:25.397 --> 34:26.596
and she's not a cougar.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.067
- That right there is a
full-blown puma.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.637
- Shit, she's comin' over here,
be cool.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.081
- Hey.

34:47.119 --> 34:47.851
- Hey.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.321
- So which one of you guys

34:51.322 --> 34:54.091
is gonna buy the thirsty girl a
drink?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.560
- Oh shit, right, of course, uh.

35:00.365 --> 35:03.567
Uh, excuse me, barkeep.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.270
Sir.

35:08.841 --> 35:09.706
- What can I get you?

35:09.708 --> 35:10.874
- The lady would like a,

35:14.680 --> 35:16.146
what would the lady like?

35:16.148 --> 35:19.282
- Adios motherfucker, if you.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.217
- Got it.

35:21.553 --> 35:22.652
- You'd like to what?

35:22.654 --> 35:25.422
- It's really cheap and
it gets really fucked up.

35:35.501 --> 35:36.666
Tip the guy, come on.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.147
- Damn, she's a bad slut.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.421
- This chick is all in.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.292
- Yup, she's crazy yo.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.628
- Yeah, you ever been
in a devil's threesome?

36:04.630 --> 36:05.562
- Nah.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.298
- Of course you haven't.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.434
Neither have I, but that's
all about to change.

36:11.436 --> 36:13.503
This is about to go down, like
for real.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.805
- What's a devil's threesome?

36:17.342 --> 36:19.609
- What do you mean, what's
a devil's threesome?

36:19.611 --> 36:21.545
We're gonna bang this girl,

36:21.547 --> 36:23.580
and at the same time and
together.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.415
- We are?

36:26.451 --> 36:27.934
- God, that's awesome.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.418
We're gonna make this puma
airtight,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.221
that's what we're gonna do.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.456
Just hope I can get it
up, I'm so fucked up.

36:36.261 --> 36:37.861
I'm gonna get this party
started.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.232
- Careful, Brad.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.635
At you now.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.782
Brad.

37:20.272 --> 37:23.907
- I need you to sound more like
a woman.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.308
More feminine.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.843
- Like this, baby?

37:26.845 --> 37:28.245
Do I sound real good?
- No.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.646
- Just like that?
- No, that's not helping, no.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.481
- You like this?

37:31.483 --> 37:33.683
Oh God, not again.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.018
I got a new problem.

37:36.255 --> 37:40.423
Uh, chick, lady, ma'am?

37:41.593 --> 37:45.495
- Meg, just call me Meg.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.900
Oh, what now, Dylan?

37:50.902 --> 37:54.804
- My contacts need out of
my head, or they'll stick.

37:55.807 --> 37:56.806
- Come again?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.575
- Sorry, ma'am, Meg.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.477
My contact lens, they're
sticking.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.645
Time to take 'em out.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.913
- You wear contacts, since when?

38:03.915 --> 38:05.915
- Since always, and they're
sticking to my eyeballs.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.617
They need out.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.686
- Yeah, I don't do that.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.856
- But--
- What happens

38:12.858 --> 38:13.957
if nothing happens?

38:13.959 --> 38:14.924
- CLARE.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.926
- Claire, who's Claire?

38:16.928 --> 38:20.330
- Contact lens acute red-eye,
CLARE.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.298
I could go blind.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.932
- Ah, seriously?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.367
- Dude, seriously?

38:24.369 --> 38:25.735
- Totally seriously.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.438
It's happened before,
like five times before.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.708
Lots of close calls, but I
think this is a record for me.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.076
Gotta get them out.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.612
- Yeah, I told you, I
don't, I don't do that.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.580
- Yeah, well, please?

38:39.718 --> 38:42.886
- Ugh, er, do I use my fingers?

38:42.888 --> 38:46.790
- Yeah, just a pinch, and on
your tip.

38:46.792 --> 38:47.724
- Uh, oh.

38:57.703 --> 38:58.852
Oh.

38:58.853 --> 39:00.002
- That was unexpectedly easy.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.940
Uh, oh.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.113
- Easy peasy, anything else?

39:14.820 --> 39:16.586
- It's like I don't even know
you.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.658
- Very good, all right, back to
it.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.793
- Oh, that was just awful.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.096
- It's all right, pal,
we'll get out of this.

39:26.098 --> 39:28.398
Everything's gonna be cool.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.101
- How, exactly, is
everything going to be cool?

39:31.103 --> 39:33.670
We're being held captive by a
crazy bitch.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.439
We're tied together, our
dicks are smashed together,

39:36.441 --> 39:38.408
and yours is rock hard and
throbbing.

39:38.410 --> 39:41.611
So how the fuck is
everything going to be cool?

39:41.613 --> 39:44.981
- There's a good chance that all
of this

39:44.983 --> 39:47.717
is just a dream.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.020
I got a good feeling about this.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.889
We're gonna wake up any minute
now.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.527
- This is no dream, Dyl.

39:57.529 --> 40:02.098
This is a very real nightmare,
that's what this is.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.106
I think this might be
a dream.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.358
What was that noise?

40:11.359 --> 40:12.609
- It's part of the dream, man.

40:13.912 --> 40:14.878
You know what?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.579
I get boners in my sleep a lot.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.747
I bet this is a dream right now

40:17.749 --> 40:18.782
'cause I have one right now.

40:18.784 --> 40:19.849
Right now, I have a--

40:19.851 --> 40:22.719
- I know, I can feel it,
remember?

40:22.721 --> 40:23.653
- Right.

40:27.959 --> 40:33.029
So do you think you could, like,
fake it?

40:33.031 --> 40:37.100
You know, pretend to like me
like that?

40:38.904 --> 40:40.570
- Your legs asleep?

40:40.572 --> 40:42.806
- Yeah, totally tingly.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.740
- Yeah, mine too.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.809
This can't be good for us.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.066
- I know, right?

40:47.067 --> 40:48.322
How do they expect us to get
boners

40:48.323 --> 40:49.578
if our legs are all asleep?

40:49.581 --> 40:51.514
- Oh, I don't know, Dyl,
but you've managed somehow.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.033
- I know, right?

40:53.034 --> 40:54.551
So maybe you can, too, right?

40:55.520 --> 40:56.453
Maybe?

40:58.590 --> 41:00.890
- Maybe.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.759
You know, maybe I should have
known.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.761
There was time at Casey's house

41:04.763 --> 41:07.130
when you were deep throating hot
dogs.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.499
And that time at Julie's

41:09.501 --> 41:10.967
when you wouldn't play strip
poker

41:10.969 --> 41:11.835
with it just us dudes.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.236
- I'm just nervous.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.907
- It's okay, I guess.

41:17.909 --> 41:22.846
Part of me, the vain part,
is flattered, but this?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.050
This is no way to find out

41:27.052 --> 41:29.118
that your best friend is a
fucking fag.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.655
Sorry, a fucking homo, is that
better?

41:34.259 --> 41:36.092
Fine, a fucking homosexual,
then.

41:37.762 --> 41:40.763
Oh, shit, are you all fucking PC
now, too?

41:40.765 --> 41:41.698
- Look.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.201
- Dyl, you're freaking me out,
what is it?

41:45.203 --> 41:46.870
- Some dude.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.538
- What dude, where, what's he
doing?

41:48.540 --> 41:49.806
- Just chillin'.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.142
- Are you sure?

41:53.144 --> 41:54.511
You're not wearing your
contacts,

41:54.513 --> 41:56.613
and you're totally squinting.

41:56.615 --> 41:59.249
- Yeah, some dude is just
chillin'.

41:59.251 --> 42:00.750
Right there, 'sup?

42:04.890 --> 42:09.192
- Hey, bro, bro, what's your
deal?

42:09.194 --> 42:10.627
State your deal.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.996
If you can hear me, do you
think,

42:12.998 --> 42:14.764
think you could help us out
here?

42:16.601 --> 42:17.534
You're sure?

42:22.240 --> 42:25.275
Holy shit, there really is a
dude.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.877
- Told you, he was just
chillin'.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.813
- Hey, bro, are you with that
chick?

42:30.815 --> 42:31.781
- Hey there.

42:31.783 --> 42:32.682
- Okay, look.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.651
You gotta help us, bro.

42:34.653 --> 42:35.952
There's this chick inside.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.555
You're not with her, right?

42:40.125 --> 42:41.891
I'll assume that's a no.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.610
She took us, kidnapped us,
really,

42:43.611 --> 42:45.328
and strung us up like this.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.797
No, no, no, no, no.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.767
Untie us first,

42:50.769 --> 42:52.869
then you can take whatever you
want.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.583
Really?

43:08.653 --> 43:09.586
- Dude's gone.

43:10.855 --> 43:13.356
Yes, Dylan.

43:13.358 --> 43:14.891
Creepy dude is gone.

43:14.893 --> 43:15.948
- You think I can't see

43:15.949 --> 43:17.004
that he's no longer looming

43:17.005 --> 43:18.060
in the fucking pool with us?

43:18.063 --> 43:19.228
- I was just sayin'.

43:23.234 --> 43:25.101
Hey, maybe he went to get help.

43:27.005 --> 43:30.974
Maybe, well, he could be getting
help.

43:30.976 --> 43:32.241
- I'm sorry, Dyl,

43:32.243 --> 43:34.978
but did that fucking
freak show have a tail?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.112
He was wearing pants,

43:36.113 --> 43:37.245
so I couldn't get a good look.

43:38.083 --> 43:39.048
- I don't think so.

43:39.050 --> 43:41.050
- Was that dude covered in fur?

43:41.052 --> 43:43.853
Was he walkin' on four legs?

43:43.855 --> 43:46.823
Oh, my God, perhaps you're
right.

43:46.825 --> 43:48.224
Do you think he might come back

43:48.226 --> 43:49.692
if we called him by name?

43:50.695 --> 43:52.629
Well, shit, let's give it a
shot.

43:55.734 --> 43:56.733
Lassie!

43:58.336 --> 43:59.969
- Lassie!

43:59.971 --> 44:01.237
- Lassie, here boy!

44:01.239 --> 44:02.238
- Lassie, here boy!

44:06.378 --> 44:08.244
- See, it's not so bad.

44:12.317 --> 44:13.249
Lassie!

44:14.352 --> 44:16.285
- They're fucking serious.

44:16.287 --> 44:18.137
- Not a word about the dude.

44:18.138 --> 44:19.988
- Unless calling to a
TV dog from the 1960s

44:19.991 --> 44:21.090
gets your dicks hard,

44:21.092 --> 44:24.160
I suggest you stop doing that.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.162
Wasting time, that's all you're
doing.

44:27.699 --> 44:31.801
I already told you, nobody
out here but us chickens.

44:35.373 --> 44:37.040
And Lassie was a girl, not a
boy,

44:37.042 --> 44:38.441
and she lived in the
countryside,

44:38.443 --> 44:39.709
not in the burnt-out suburbs.

44:39.711 --> 44:41.678
- Wrong, Lassie's a weird dude.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.412
- Hey, sh.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.786
- What in God's name
are you talking about?

44:50.955 --> 44:53.423
- I don't know, just sayin'
stuff

44:53.425 --> 44:55.858
and odd things like that.

44:55.860 --> 45:00.296
- Uh huh, record's winding down

45:00.298 --> 45:01.364
and the sun's starting to set,

45:01.366 --> 45:02.999
so you guys better get to it.

45:04.302 --> 45:05.234
- Hey, Dyl.

45:05.236 --> 45:10.339
When I tell you not to say
anything, don't say anything.

45:10.341 --> 45:12.375
- Got it, sorry.

45:13.845 --> 45:16.979
It's just, what if Lassie
decides to come back?

45:16.981 --> 45:19.882
And, and what?

45:19.884 --> 45:23.386
- Well, how we know
his name's even Lassie?

45:23.388 --> 45:26.289
- Fuck, oh my God, we don't,
Dyl.

45:26.291 --> 45:27.790
It's a fucking guess.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.275
Are you always like this

45:29.276 --> 45:30.759
when you're not high or drinking
or both?

45:30.762 --> 45:33.830
- I don't know, I guess so.

45:33.832 --> 45:36.866
I'm usually high or
drinking or both, yeah.

45:47.812 --> 45:49.312
- Just get hard with me,

45:49.313 --> 45:50.813
and she'll let us go, and
no one will ever know.

45:50.815 --> 45:52.281
- I'm not gay, you fuck.

45:52.283 --> 45:54.217
- Neither am I, I'm just goin'
along.

45:54.219 --> 45:57.153
- How could you not have told
me?

45:57.155 --> 45:58.287
You're my best friend.

45:58.289 --> 46:00.156
- I still am, I'm your bro.

46:01.326 --> 46:02.425
- We were gonna be cops.

46:02.427 --> 46:03.960
- We still can be cops, I'm
just--

46:03.962 --> 46:06.462
- Nervous, I know.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.271
- Phase three?

46:15.273 --> 46:16.939
- That's what she said.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.141
- That's what she said.

46:18.143 --> 46:20.510
So just get hard with me.

46:20.512 --> 46:21.528
- Where is she?

46:21.529 --> 46:22.545
- Don't know, get hard with me.

46:22.547 --> 46:23.479
- Quiet.

46:25.416 --> 46:26.282
Can you hear that?

46:26.284 --> 46:27.150
- Get hard with me.

46:27.152 --> 46:28.217
- Sounds like banging.

46:28.219 --> 46:30.086
- I don't care, get hard with
me.

46:53.077 --> 46:54.944
- All right, fuck it.

46:58.116 --> 46:59.415
I'm goin' in.

47:00.451 --> 47:01.484
Let's do this.

47:01.486 --> 47:03.269
- What do you need from me?

47:03.270 --> 47:05.053
- Nothing, please just say
nothing.

47:11.229 --> 47:13.229
Oh, that's
it, you can do it, man.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.836
You can do it.
- Shut up.

47:19.838 --> 47:20.570
Sorry.

47:31.583 --> 47:32.515
- Shit.

47:35.019 --> 47:37.520
But I thought it was just us
chickens.

47:39.457 --> 47:41.858
How are my two
favorite homophobes?

47:42.927 --> 47:44.077
- Aaron?

47:44.078 --> 47:45.228
It's Orin, it's always
been Orin,

47:45.230 --> 47:46.596
and I know that you know that.

47:46.598 --> 47:48.898
Hey, look, it's
Fancy Pants on the screen.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.300
Fuck you, it's Orin.

47:57.909 --> 47:59.342
- You really think this'll hold
them?

47:59.344 --> 48:01.577
- Yeah, I've tested them,
they're good.

48:03.548 --> 48:05.381
- You're one sick, twisted kid,

48:07.886 --> 48:08.618
but I like it.

48:09.621 --> 48:10.553
- Oh, my God.

48:10.555 --> 48:13.522
I'm so happy you said that, so
you're in.

48:13.524 --> 48:16.559
- Yes, but you have to keep a
cool head through everything.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.261
- Of course.

48:18.262 --> 48:19.962
- No flying off the handle
like you usually do.

48:19.964 --> 48:20.630
- Never.

48:20.632 --> 48:22.565
- Cool, calm, collected.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.133
- Always.

48:24.135 --> 48:25.902
- And I'm gonna pick them up on
my own.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.170
- No, no.

48:28.172 --> 48:29.906
- You have to stay here
and lock the place down

48:29.908 --> 48:31.007
and wait until I come back.

48:31.009 --> 48:32.174
- No way.

48:32.176 --> 48:33.276
I'm helping with the abduction.

48:33.278 --> 48:34.594
What kind of brother would I be

48:34.595 --> 48:35.911
if I left you to do that by
yourself?

48:35.914 --> 48:37.680
- Ugh, you sound like
every man in my life.

48:37.682 --> 48:39.181
What, because I'm a girl,

48:39.183 --> 48:40.516
I can't fend for myself, you
know what--

48:40.518 --> 48:42.985
- Stop with the feminism crap,
okay?

48:42.987 --> 48:43.920
Just stop it.

48:43.922 --> 48:47.089
You don't know these
mouth breathers like I do.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.658
They're strapping.

48:48.660 --> 48:51.694
Plus, abduction's number
seven on my bucket list.

48:51.696 --> 48:53.462
- What's number six?

48:53.464 --> 48:54.463
- The Grand Canyon.

48:58.403 --> 49:00.169
- You're not coming,
and they can't see you.

49:00.171 --> 49:01.570
We have to make them at least
believe

49:01.572 --> 49:04.106
that you tried to off yourself.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.508
- But I could hide.

49:05.510 --> 49:06.676
- Take it or leave it.

49:08.513 --> 49:09.445
- Okay.

49:11.416 --> 49:14.617
Okay, okay, I'll take it.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.619
You can be such a bully
sometimes, you know that?

49:16.621 --> 49:19.021
- Just don't be a dick.

49:19.023 --> 49:20.589
- Won't be a dick, promise.

49:21.392 --> 49:23.025
- You are such a dick.

49:23.027 --> 49:23.960
- Sorry.

49:34.339 --> 49:38.574
Damn, she's a
bad slut.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.254
- I'm gonna get this party
started.

49:52.256 --> 49:53.556
Careful, Brad.

50:00.131 --> 50:01.063
Bravo.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.467
It's me, it's me, it's me.

50:08.072 --> 50:09.505
- Can't believe you.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.507
- Just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

50:16.247 --> 50:18.247
- Feet off the dash, this is a
rental.

50:32.063 --> 50:32.795
Jesus.

50:37.301 --> 50:39.101
- Well done, safety first.

50:39.103 --> 50:40.703
Wouldn't want them to go
cartwheeling down the highway,

50:40.705 --> 50:41.570
now would we?

50:41.572 --> 50:44.373
Although, although,

50:46.344 --> 50:48.477
that would be spectacular.

50:54.419 --> 50:55.518
But, but what a waste.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.452
What a waste that would be,

50:56.454 --> 50:57.887
what a fucking waste.

50:57.888 --> 50:59.321
No, no, no, we do this now,

50:59.323 --> 51:01.257
we do this now, we do this
fucking now.

51:01.259 --> 51:02.675
Jesus.

51:02.676 --> 51:04.092
- Get the door.
- Shh, please tell me

51:04.095 --> 51:05.361
you're not off your meds.

51:05.363 --> 51:07.463
- I'm on my meds.

51:07.465 --> 51:09.165
- What did we say about loose
cannons

51:09.167 --> 51:11.133
and how you can't be one?

51:11.135 --> 51:12.501
- I'm totally fine.

51:12.503 --> 51:14.236
The Addies help me with my
narcolepsy.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.771
You don't know what it's like.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.339
- Narcolepsy?

51:17.341 --> 51:19.008
You never had narcolepsy.

51:19.009 --> 51:20.676
- Yeah, that's like your
opinion, move.

51:20.678 --> 51:24.814
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

51:24.816 --> 51:26.215
- Oh my, fuck.

51:36.360 --> 51:38.227
Who's in charge now?

51:39.730 --> 51:41.230
Oh, fuck.

52:05.756 --> 52:08.257
- Let's move these piles into
position.

52:08.259 --> 52:10.860
Hey, you look like
shit.

52:12.230 --> 52:13.662
Do you want some shit?

52:14.599 --> 52:16.765
I got some shit.

52:16.767 --> 52:20.569
- No, I don't want some
shit, I want a nap.

52:20.571 --> 52:21.737
Now, get your skinny ass in here

52:21.739 --> 52:23.672
and help me move these pieces.

52:23.674 --> 52:26.675
- Fine, be that way.

53:25.336 --> 53:27.203
- Fuck, I'm so bored.

53:36.847 --> 53:39.481
- The time is near.

53:39.483 --> 53:43.219
After weeks of hints and clues,

53:43.221 --> 53:46.689
this hooded homo shall out a
closeted jock

53:46.691 --> 53:48.958
who has been masquerading about
the halls

53:48.960 --> 53:50.292
of this high school

53:50.294 --> 53:53.395
as not only a straight star
athlete,

53:53.397 --> 53:54.863
but a gay basher, as well.

53:54.865 --> 53:58.667
Sometimes push comes to shove,

53:58.669 --> 53:59.835
and this hooded homo

53:59.837 --> 54:02.771
is poised and ready to shove
motherfucker

54:02.773 --> 54:06.542
all over the internet, stand by.

54:13.284 --> 54:14.883
Go on, do something.

55:04.769 --> 55:08.537
I'm not a believer, but
that always seems to work.

55:14.879 --> 55:17.446
Here we go, it's happening.

55:30.995 --> 55:31.860
Orin.

55:31.862 --> 55:33.729
- Sure, Aaron.
- Orin.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.365
- That's right.

55:36.366 --> 55:38.066
- Orin, whatever, so what?
- That's right.

55:38.069 --> 55:40.402
Gonna ask you again.

55:40.404 --> 55:41.937
What the fuck do you want from
us?

55:41.939 --> 55:43.505
Yeah, just
tell us what you want,

55:43.507 --> 55:45.107
and we'll give it to
you, anything you want.

55:45.109 --> 55:47.426
Shut your fuckin' face.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.744
Sure, why would we
worry about that minor detail?

55:49.747 --> 55:51.046
Listen, I'm serious.

55:51.048 --> 55:52.348
I've got a guy who's really good

55:52.350 --> 55:53.900
with the whole face-blurring
thing.

55:53.901 --> 55:55.451
So if you play your cards right,

55:55.453 --> 55:57.720
you can keep your anonymity,

55:57.722 --> 56:00.522
even if the study garners any
recognition.

56:00.524 --> 56:01.824
- Fuck that.

56:01.826 --> 56:04.126
Anonymity is not an option for
you at all.

56:05.563 --> 56:07.796
In fact, you know what?

56:17.108 --> 56:18.540
Guys, over here.

56:27.818 --> 56:30.419
Well, this is fucking
weird.

56:30.421 --> 56:32.821
Totally, but boobs,
right?

56:41.098 --> 56:42.164
- You fucking kidding me?

56:43.467 --> 56:44.733
You kidding me right now?

56:47.872 --> 56:49.438
They almost saw you, they almost
saw you.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.006
I had to flash those morons my
tits

56:51.008 --> 56:52.941
for them to not see you or,

56:52.943 --> 56:55.978
Oh, my God.

56:55.979 --> 56:59.014
Orin, I am absolutely
down to do this with you,

56:59.016 --> 57:01.150
for you, and about you and your
cause,

57:01.152 --> 57:03.786
but you have to meet me halfway.

57:03.788 --> 57:05.754
We must stick with the script.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.423
Do I make myself clear?

57:08.125 --> 57:09.057
- Yes.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.627
- No more loose cannon shit.

57:12.730 --> 57:15.597
Keep it up, and I pull the plug.

57:15.599 --> 57:16.865
And I will untie them,

57:16.867 --> 57:18.767
and we will all go out to
breakfast.

57:29.146 --> 57:30.679
- I'm so stupid.

57:36.053 --> 57:38.987
Come here.

57:38.989 --> 57:39.922
Come here.

57:48.232 --> 57:49.231
Look at me.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.568
I know you're excited.

57:53.471 --> 57:54.470
We're all excited.

57:54.472 --> 57:57.139
But a lot's gone into this
crazy and fucked up plan,

57:57.141 --> 57:58.841
and I need you to stay focused

57:58.843 --> 58:01.677
if we're going to see this
through and done correctly.

58:03.180 --> 58:04.112
- I know.

58:05.850 --> 58:07.816
- Just sit tight, let me do my
thing.

58:09.720 --> 58:10.919
- Okay.

58:18.896 --> 58:20.929
Do you think they'll sign your
contract?

58:20.931 --> 58:23.665
See, that's
what I'm talking about.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.534
You don't need to sweat that
stuff.

58:27.137 --> 58:31.874
To answer your
question, yeah, I do.

58:33.577 --> 58:35.344
I'm gonna get them to sign

58:35.345 --> 58:37.112
exactly what I need them
to sign for my thesis,

58:37.114 --> 58:42.184
and then, you can have
your sweet, sweet revenge.

58:44.588 --> 58:45.654
- It shall be sweet.

58:46.790 --> 58:48.924
- What do you say in the
meantime,

58:48.926 --> 58:51.760
just take it easy, you know?

58:51.762 --> 58:54.129
Lay off the pills for a shift
or two, maybe take a nap,

58:54.131 --> 58:55.597
let me work on 'em a bit?

58:59.136 --> 59:00.068
- Deal.

59:02.740 --> 59:03.672
- Good deal.

59:06.677 --> 59:08.143
You just keep cool.

59:09.680 --> 59:10.712
Let me go to work.

59:14.685 --> 59:15.817
Love you, mean it.

59:15.819 --> 59:17.119
- Love you, mean it.

59:22.660 --> 59:26.895
- Fuck your deal, bitch,
this is my operation.

59:26.897 --> 59:29.197
Just kidding, love you.

59:30.334 --> 59:32.334
Now do my bidding, you little
bitch.

59:32.336 --> 59:33.652
I don't mean that.

59:33.653 --> 59:34.969
Spit
in my fucking mouth.

59:34.972 --> 59:36.204
Fuck you, fuck, fuck you,

59:36.206 --> 59:38.206
fuck everyone, fuck, fuck, fuck!

59:38.208 --> 59:39.174
Love you.

59:57.895 --> 59:59.294
- Son of a bitch.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.167
This was not the plan.

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:07.836
This has never been the plan.

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:09.638
You're gonna ruin everything
that we've worked for

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.073
with this stupid kid shit.

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:14.676
What we're doing is way bigger
than this,

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.845
way more important than that.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.682
- You just don't get it.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.785
- Don't get it, nobody gets it.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:27.189
That's the problem with
you, nobody ever gets it.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.890
Orin knows best.

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:30.642
Look at yourself.

01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:32.393
Does this look like the life
of somebody who knows best?

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.763
- If I show you, you'll
understand.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.935
- Show me what, show me what,
Orin?

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:41.803
- All of me.

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:53.849
- So what am I supposed
to understand, exactly?

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.017
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.085
Orin, you better open up

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:58.937
this fucking door.

01:00:58.938 --> 01:01:00.788
You've lost your fucking
mind, are you kidding me?

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:02.057
- You just don't get it.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:06.128
Ugh, let me fuck out.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.796
- I wanna go viral.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:09.297
- Orin!

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:11.233
- I need to go viral.

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.703
- Un-fucking-believable.

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:26.782
- Who's in charge now, me,
that's who.

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:32.054
I just can't hear this right
now.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.722
Fuck, fuck it, fuck.

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:36.258
It's okay, everything's okay,
mm.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.429
Going to my happy place.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.219
Let me the fuck out.

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:15.030
- Show time.

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.237
Show time.

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:30.445
How are my two
favorite homophobes?

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:31.680
Aaron?

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.914
- It's Orin, it's always been
Orin,

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.883
and I know that you know that.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:35.984
Hey, look, it's
Fancy Pants on screen.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.887
- Fuck you, it's Orin.

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:41.289
Oh God, stop, stop, your moment,

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.925
not theirs, your moment, your
moment.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.996
Ooh, ooh, okay.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.435
I wanna thank you both so much

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.271
for being a part of this
experience.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:03:00.308
The last few hours have
been quite educational.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:05.013
Oh yes, I've been watching
and on the edge of my seat

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:07.315
absolutely riddled with
anticipation.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.184
The results are in.

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:16.024
Dylan did quite well, as we all
know.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:18.927
Hell, by now, just about
everybody knows that much.

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:23.298
As for you, Brad, you gave it
your best.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:26.835
That much was evident.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:29.971
There was even a little bit of
movement

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:34.276
down there at one point,
but unfortunately,

01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:37.312
it wasn't enough to make
contact with your gay pal there.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.815
Turns out you were wrong,

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:45.253
homosexuality isn't as simple
as a choice.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:53.028
Your failure pleases me greatly.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.131
One, it proves what
most of us already knew.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:04:00.202
And two, it means we get to move
on

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:04.973
to my favorite phase of all
the phases, phase three.

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:11.346
Oh, I just love this part so
much.

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:18.920
Oh, what the fuck?

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:36.338
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.272
Get the fuck off of them!

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.642
Orin!

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:41.643
- Fuck!

01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:59.661
You've lost your fucking
mind.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:00.562
You don't wanna do this.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:01.496
- Quiet, you!

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.001
Do stop that, do stop that.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:09.437
Do stop that, do stop that, do
stop that.

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:12.073
Do stop that, do stop that, do
stop that,

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.309
do stop that, do stop that, do.

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.478
These damn things are so fickle.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.380
Always falling off the runner.

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:27.322
So much better.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:33.495
Let's do this!

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.138
Just why won't he let
me ride?

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.840
He never lets me ride.

01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:46.541
Oh, I don't think
he learned how to share.

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.243
- Yeah, he was probably a
fucking only child, man.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.394
I should fuck you up.

01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:50.544
- Oh yeah, he's definitely
an only fuckin' child.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.080
He couldn't be doing it.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.249
So Talkie, what the
fuck are we doin' here?

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:56.151
What are we doin'?

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.020
You know, usually, I'm able to
pick up

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:01.423
what the fuck you're ever it
is you're trying to put down,

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:04.025
but this time, this time,
I'm a little stumped,

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.328
to be quite honest, you know?

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.229
I mean, don't get me wrong, I
mean,

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.731
it's not like I don't appreciate
you

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:11.700
comin' to us first, though,

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.069
whatever the fuck this is,

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:17.472
but I would just like to
know before we get there,

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.275
you know, maybe, he's not even
listening.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:22.744
Hey, when the fuck you gonna let
us

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:23.678
ride that thing, anyway?

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.846
- Hey, man, sharing is caring.

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.013
When are you gonna let us ride
it?

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:27.315
- Ever?
- Yeah, man.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.900
- Talkie, when are you
gonna let us ride it?

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:30.484
- Talkie, don't act
like you can't hear me.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:32.253
- Talkie.
- Hey, fuck you.

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.126
Mute bitch.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.769
- And it's never anything that--

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.210
- Sometimes it works out.
- Means anything.

01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:43.651
- Yeah, people to pay me--
- Shut the fuck up.

01:06:43.652 --> 01:06:45.092
- You're gonna be fine.

01:06:45.093 --> 01:06:46.533
- Talkie, Talkie.
- Fuck.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.237
- What, Talkie, what?

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:50.722
- What now?

01:06:50.723 --> 01:06:52.206
- What's the big deal?
- It's an empty yard.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:53.942
- That's it, man,

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:54.775
you can do it.
- Not helping.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:55.710
- Sorry.

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.555
- Come on, right there, almost.

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:08.423
You can do it.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.357
- Shut up!

01:07:12.396 --> 01:07:13.495
- Faggot shit.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:17.565
- Shit.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:21.069
Oh, but I thought it was just us
chickens.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:27.409
Oh, ooh, what?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.578
- Oh, please don't.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.715
How are my two
favorite homophobes?

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:36.418
- Aaron?

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.019
It's Orin, it's always
been Orin,

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.620
and I know that you know that.

01:07:39.621 --> 01:07:41.221
Hey, look, it's
Fancy Pants on the screen!

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.391
Fuck you, it's Orin.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.594
Oh, God, stop, stop,
your moment, not theirs.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:49.164
Your moment, your moment, ooh.

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:52.100
I wanna thank you both so much

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.769
for being a part of this
experience.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:58.440
The last few hours have
been quite educational.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:01.943
- Hey.

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.610
I've been watching
it on the edge of my seat

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:04.646
absolutely riddled with
anticipation.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:05.580
- Talkie.

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:07.549
- Psst, come here.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.157
- Give me your eye.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.625
Hand over the eye.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:21.595
Hey, how about I use
the other fuckin' eye?

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:22.997
- Yeah, probably fly a little
better.

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:24.399
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bro shit.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:26.334
Wasn't enough to
make contact with your gay--

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.402
- Atta boy.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.814
And two, it means
that we get to move on

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.751
to my favorite phase, phase
three.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.555
Oh, I just love this part so
much.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:51.725
Oh, fuck.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.765
- Hi.

01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:58.700
- Hey.

01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:00.401
Hi there.

01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:01.269
Hello.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.203
Go fuck yourself.

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:05.140
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no!

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:06.908
Get the fuck off of them!

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.510
- That guy, he's gonna
come through that door.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.743
- Yeah?
- When he does,

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:12.814
bean him with that sink.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:14.782
- Can do.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:17.919
Quiet, you!

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:21.523
Do stop that, do stop that, do
stop that,

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.791
do stop that, do stop that, do
stop that.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.795
These damn things are so fickle.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.497
Always falling off the runners.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.667
Ah, ah.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.671
Oh, it's so much better.

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:42.810
Let's do this!

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.348
- Woo!

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.616
- Woo.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.818
- That was awesome.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.756
- All right, guys, we get it.

01:10:11.757 --> 01:10:12.973
You're in charge, now, shut it
off.

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:14.375
- But I don't wanna wait for it

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.510
to get over their heads, man.

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:16.611
That's gonna take forever.

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:17.745
- So what?

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.230
Where do you gotta be?

01:10:19.231 --> 01:10:20.714
- Nowhere, I just think that
electrocution

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:21.950
would be so much better.

01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:26.354
- So, go find a toaster.

01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:30.558
And also an extension cord.

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.860
- Oh, shit.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:36.297
Please tell me that you guys
are just fucking with us.

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:37.265
- What the fuck?

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.633
- There's that question again.

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:39.734
- What the fuck is this?

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.803
- Hey, new socks.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:44.339
The homo has joined us.

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:45.373
It's Orin.

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:48.576
- What do you think would happen

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.812
if I knocked this thing in?

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:53.281
- Fucked if I know.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.250
- Should I do it, Talkie?

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:56.251
- Please don't.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:57.418
- I'm doin' it.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.353
- Please don't.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:02.357
- What, what, use your words,
shit.

01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:05.593
All right, all right, all right.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.497
- Seriously, there's like
real equipment in here.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:11.399
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:14.302
Talkie doesn't go in for
that newfangled shit.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.637
He's old school.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.348
- Yeah, well that just sounds
horrible.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.417
Fuck this, I'm
gonna go find a toaster.

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:36.658
- All right, so what exactly is
going on?

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.360
- This crazy fucking bitch--

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:40.762
- She's super nuts.
- These motherfuckers--

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:41.629
- This crazy bitch--
- She's super nuts.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.563
- Shut up.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.899
Not all everybody at once.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.934
You sound like a bunch of
cluckin' hens.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:48.870
Jesus, I just can't.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.307
Now, you.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:55.026
Why you hangin' there

01:11:55.027 --> 01:11:56.643
with your dick avatared to that
kid?

01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.380
Avatared?

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:00.448
- Yeah, you know.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.917
Like the movie, the blue one.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:07.622
Your dick is like connected,
like, inserted, even.

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:09.691
It's like they did with the
tails.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:12.827
You know, you're avatarted

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.065
Avatarted, get it, that's
a good one.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.402
Hey, Frank, you missed it.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:22.804
I just called 'em avatarted.

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:26.007
Anyways, this crazy
bitch--

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:27.075
- Shut the fuck up.

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.009
Frank?

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:31.713
Avatarted,

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:32.680
that's hilarious, Hank!

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.815
Yes, I know.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:35.750
- Don't tell them about Meg.

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:37.652
- Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.953
- That sounds pretty rad.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:40.822
Does it?

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:43.825
- Dude, the homo was holding out
on us.

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:44.692
We got Adderall up here,

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.860
and you better believe

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.027
I'm crushin' that shit up right
now.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.696
Crushed blue dust up in here,

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.666
crushed addies, yeah.

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:52.834
- Fuck yes!

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:55.937
Hey, hey, bring that shit down
here.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:58.539
- Will do, Hank.

01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:00.708
- Wait a minute.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:04.679
His name is Frank, and yours is
Hank?

01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:05.613
Frank and Hank?

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:07.582
That's so gay.

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:09.650
- Oh yeah, is it?

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.152
As gay as your dick right now,

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:12.954
touchin' his dick, huh?

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.924
- This crazy bitch picked
us up at a bar last night,

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.093
led us on, and then kidnapped
us.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:22.497
Kidnapped by
a girl?

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.049
You guys are pussies.

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:25.600
- Listen, she used her van
against us,

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.603
and she had tear gas and a gas
mask, and--

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:30.505
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait.

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:31.506
What crazy bitch?

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:32.640
His sister.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:36.511
- Pigs in a Blanket.

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:37.629
It's Orin.

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:38.746
Is he speakin' the
truth?

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.916
- Yeah, she's kinda crazy.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.684
- And she's your sister?

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:45.186
- Yes.

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:48.423
- Yeah, see now we're gettin'
somewhere.

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:54.462
All right, and so where
is this crazy bitch now?

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:57.899
- I'm telling you, your
guess is as good as ours.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.934
We're just pawns in their little
game.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.536
Now, will you please turn off
the spigot?

01:14:01.538 --> 01:14:03.905
- Ooh, that's racist.

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.740
- Spigot is not racist.

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:08.476
And would you please just turn
it off?

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:10.511
- Pigs in a Blanket, where
is your sister right now?

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.146
- Name is Orin.

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:13.981
- Sweet.

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:16.935
Bam.

01:14:16.936 --> 01:14:18.186
- Ooh, welly welly welly well.

01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:21.556
- Welly welly well.
- Yes, yes.

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:28.863
Ugh, ai ai ack.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:31.466
Particulate hairs.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.539
- Okay.
- Well.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.840
- That is--
- So, all right, fine.

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:42.109
- So help me understand this.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.980
Where, where is this
crazy bitch sister now?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.782
She just, she just disappeared?

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:49.150
- Who disappeared?

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:52.787
- All right, Pigs in a Blanket's
got

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.088
a crazy bitch sister.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.790
She kidnapped these two
pussies--

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:56.958
- A girl, what pussies.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.125
That's what I'm
sayin', they're pussies.

01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:00.628
- Hm.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:03.130
- And who made you all up to
look like fag marionettes?

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:04.232
- She did.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:05.166
- She did.

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:09.487
Why?

01:15:09.488 --> 01:15:11.004
- Because she's a crazy bitch,
that's why.

01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:13.274
- Fair enough.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:14.509
- This shit is boring.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.743
I'm gonna go find a toaster.

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.977
- All right, you do what you
gotta do.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.581
- She said it was for an
experiment for her class.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.116
- She said.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.135
- Trying to prove some point

01:15:24.136 --> 01:15:26.153
about homosexuality not
being a choice or some shit.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:28.189
That's hilarious.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.790
Of course, it's a fucking
choice.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:30.858
- That's what I said.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:31.993
But she said we had to prove it

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.027
before she'd let us go.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.028
- She said.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.831
- What, what?

01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:43.170
- She said if we got hard for
each other,

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.305
she'd let us go.

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:52.113
- That is also hilarious.

01:15:52.115 --> 01:15:54.115
Like the day's really lookin'
up.

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:58.252
All right, so she said
she picked you two, why?

01:15:58.254 --> 01:15:59.587
She said.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.090
- Kid, why do you keep sayin'
that?

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:05.159
- I don't know, 'cause
that's what she said.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.260
It's funny and stuff.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:08.029
- Is it?

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.232
Friend's retarded.

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:13.384
- He is.

01:16:13.385 --> 01:16:14.167
- Shut the fuck up.
- Shut up.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:15.636
- Merely agreeing.

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:17.622
- Anyway, what I was getting at

01:16:17.623 --> 01:16:19.607
is that we might have fucked
with this dude in school.

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:21.175
It's up for debate.

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.742
- Up for debate, fuck you, up
for debate.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.346
You fucked with me, you
both fucked with me daily.

01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:27.715
- All right, I can see that.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:30.685
So how'd it go?

01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:33.321
- How did what go?

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.289
- You know, the experiment.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.092
- I don't know, ask him.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:38.960
- Pigs in a Blanket.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:40.173
It's Orin.

01:16:40.174 --> 01:16:41.385
How'd the experiment
go?

01:16:41.386 --> 01:16:42.597
- One of them failed miserably.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.132
The other flourished.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:50.204
- Oh, good for you,
brother, good for you, eh?

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:51.973
Way to put up a fight

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.676
Uh, you know, that's a problem
these days.

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:57.111
I mean, the gays are fuckin'

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.781
takin' over everything,
you know?

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:02.149
You know, there's this guy,

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.018
lives around these parts, all
right,

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.052
runs around here

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:09.190
and he's a little funny, you
know,

01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:11.058
a little funny, know what I
mean?

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.629
Huh, I mean, can you
imagine that, a gay dude

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.930
walkin' around thinkin' he's in
charge

01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:17.932
of this fucked-up situation?

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:18.833
- Like to hear you talk that way

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.034
when he's around.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:22.069
- Hey, shut the fuck up, Frank.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.304
Hey, why don't you be fuckin'
useful?

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.739
Bring me some more fuckin' drugs

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.807
and better yet, fix this fuckin'
spigot.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.342
- I'm still lookin' for a
toaster.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.777
- He actually tried.

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.178
- Wait, tried, tried what?

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:36.183
- Brad attempted to cross over.

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.153
- It's true, asked me to
talk like a chick, even.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.187
- Dude.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.727
- Fuck you.
- You tried to get it up

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:50.264
for your bro.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:53.300
Oh, this is great, this is
fucking great.

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:55.102
Frank, come down here.

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:56.404
Your water's gushin' now.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:06.714
- Brad, Dylan.

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:08.182
The fuck do you want?

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:13.821
- I'm only gonna say this once,
I'm sorry.

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:16.824
Fantastic for all of
us.

01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:17.892
Fancy Pants is sorry.

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:18.959
Well, that doesn't do
any good for any of us,

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:20.294
now does it?

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:21.328
It's Orin.

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:24.699
And this wasn't the plan.

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:27.101
Yeah, well what
exactly was the plan?

01:18:27.103 --> 01:18:28.369
I'm racking my brain over
here tryin' to figure it out.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:31.005
- I just wanted a taste of
vengeance.

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.673
Heard it was sweet.

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.340
Wanted to humiliate you
two for fucking with me.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:37.144
Well, feel good about
yourself.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.447
I'm absolutely and utterly
humiliated at the moment.

01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:41.482
Fuck that,
I'm not, just nervous.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:44.719
- Dyl, please.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.020
- What do you think
they're gonna do to us?

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:47.188
- I don't know, Aaron.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:48.422
Your guess is as good as mine.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:49.724
- It's Orin.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:50.791
- Whatever.

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:52.727
Where's your sister?

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:54.061
- She's gone, she took off.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:54.929
- She left?

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:55.830
- Yeah.

01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:57.264
- That seems odd.

01:18:57.266 --> 01:18:58.933
Bitch got scared.

01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.402
- Dylan, shut the fuck up.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:04.772
- Brad, do you think you
could take those guys?

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.807
- These clowns, of
course I could take 'em.

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:09.143
- Do you really think you could
take 'em?

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:12.813
- Yes, if my hands weren't
hog-tied to my legs

01:19:12.815 --> 01:19:14.849
and if I wasn't suspended
by a series of ropes

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:17.051
in an empty pool with my dick
looped to my friend here,

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:19.386
then yeah, I could take
these drug-addled bitches.

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:21.756
- Listen to me very carefully.

01:19:23.493 --> 01:19:25.326
You should be able to free
yourself.

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:26.878
- And how's that?

01:19:26.879 --> 01:19:28.429
- That's a Chinese finger trap
down there.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.619
- Yeah.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.808
- The secret to its release--

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:31.997
- Holy shit, dude, my boner's
gone.

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.033
Great, Dyl, not now.

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:34.268
- Oh.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.038
- If you submit to it, give in,

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.007
then it releases, and you'll be
free.

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:41.876
- I'm so serial, it's soft now.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:43.878
- Not now, please.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.545
- Oh.

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:45.880
- What does that mean?

01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:46.947
How do we submit?

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.883
- Just do exactly what I tell
you.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:50.084
- I fuckin' hate the sound of
that.

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:52.219
- It's gone, really.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.487
- You're not going to like it,

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:55.089
but you're going to have to
trust me.

01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:56.591
- Great, go.

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:58.092
- Smash your groins together
with force.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:19:59.126
- Fuck you.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.245
- Not kidding.

01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:03.363
The knots I have you in
will release with slack.

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:06.267
And I knew you'd never do it on
your own,

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.369
and it was going to be awesome.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.404
And I'd let you know that
the secret to your release

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.373
was always right there in front
of you,

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:13.841
but your own homophobia

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.308
would have never afforded such a
scenario

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.128
for you to do this on your own.

01:20:17.129 --> 01:20:18.946
And it would have been
awe-inspiring and meaningful

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:20.848
and poetic and all that shit.

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:21.982
But then these guys showed up,

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.684
and everything went to shit

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.385
just like everything
always does in my life.

01:20:25.386 --> 01:20:27.086
And I wanna fucking smash
and obliterate everything

01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:28.088
and all this bullshit, it's so--

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:31.025
- Shut up, shit.

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:33.127
So things got fucked, all right?

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:35.112
How do we fix it?

01:20:35.113 --> 01:20:37.096
And I swear to God, if you
are fucking with me, I'll--

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:38.499
- You'll what?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.900
Wait for the water to rise to a
level

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:41.902
where you might be able to
float in my general direction

01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:43.871
and nudge me as you pass by?

01:20:43.873 --> 01:20:47.074
Just do it, smash your groins
together.

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:51.045
- You ready?

01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:52.213
- This better work, faggot.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.849
- Faggot, really?

01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:57.017
You're the one with a fucking
hard-on.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.520
- It's gone, I already
told you, it's gone.

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:00.855
Oh wait, maybe not.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.295
- Okay, we're mashed, now what?

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.965
- Okay, now roll your shoulders
back

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:14.201
at the same time.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:16.871
And your straps should release.

01:21:16.873 --> 01:21:18.439
- Shit, my boner's back.

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.211
- Not now, Dyl, just roll
your shoulders on three.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:28.549
Oh, I hate this so much.

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:31.619
One, please work.

01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:36.991
Two, fuck you, three.

01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:46.967
- What's happening, did it work?

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:49.470
- Kind of, we're on our sides
now.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:51.205
But our arms and legs are
still--

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:52.139
- What?

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:53.007
Shit, shit, shit.

01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:54.241
What, what, what?

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.977
- Looks like I won.

01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:57.978
- Hey, Aaron.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.380
- It's Orin.

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:01.215
- We're still tied up.

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:02.249
- Really?

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.217
- Just really.

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:04.418
- Brad's dick is out, though.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.086
- Not relevant in the least!

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.960
- Found a toaster and an
extension cord.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:13.661
- Great.

01:22:13.663 --> 01:22:14.528
- Holy fuck.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.130
- What?

01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:17.164
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:27.975
- Rude.

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:34.581
- What the fuck are you doin'?

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:36.717
- Sorry, I thought it was,

01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:37.952
thought the cord was long
enough.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:38.986
If I didn't throw it so far,

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.019
I think it probably would have--

01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:41.388
- Would, would have what?

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.258
- You know, electrocute them.

01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:48.395
- No, no we're not doin' that.

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:50.230
We're not, we're not doin'
murder.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:53.667
God, what's wrong with you?

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:55.336
Nothing.

01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:57.037
I just thought that we
were gonna have some fun

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:58.405
and fry these fuckers, man.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:01.742
- Yeah, Talkie's right.

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:03.677
What about all the fuckin'
equipment?

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.611
I mean, there's actual
value shit down there.

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:07.681
- I thought since they were
trespassing, we could just--

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:10.451
- Trespassing, trespassing?

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:13.220
We are all trespassing, all
right?

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:15.222
And none of this shit is ours.

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:17.524
It's fuckin' nobody's.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:19.226
We were just gonna steal the
shit,

01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:21.729
scare the fuck out of
'em, and bail, all right?

01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:23.097
Like, that's it.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.464
Please don't
steal my sister's shit.

01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:25.432
She'll kill me.

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.468
- Shut up you, Pigs in a
Blanket.

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.269
- He's right, she's crazy.

01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:30.437
Probably track you down and
string you up

01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:32.473
or some shit.

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:34.508
- Yeah well, how about you
shut the fuck up, Tiny Dick?

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.443
You know, she's
probably gonna break out

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:40.080
of that drum room upstairs any
minute now

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:41.448
and be down here raisin' hell.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.716
- You locked her up?

01:23:42.718 --> 01:23:44.685
Totally, she
was being such a snatch.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:48.422
- Wait, what, she's here?

01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:49.656
Upstairs, in the drum
room.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.792
- She's upstairs in the drum
room.

01:23:51.794 --> 01:23:53.694
Thought you did a sweep
of the house, Frank.

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:55.379
- I did, I did, Hank, I did.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.063
It's just that one of the
rooms was locked, okay?

01:23:57.066 --> 01:23:58.732
- Oh, one of the doors was
locked.

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:02.503
Oh God, does it ever end with
you?

01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:04.638
Geez, your level of
incompetence,

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:09.343
it continues to astound and
amaze me.

01:24:09.345 --> 01:24:10.444
- Thank you.

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:11.678
- It wasn't a compliment.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:16.350
- Oh look, yeah, now the water's
drainin' out of the pool.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:19.319
- Good, good, 'cause
we're not doin' murder.

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:21.588
- So boring, so then what?

01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:28.195
- All right, I don't know.

01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:40.240
- No way, no way, no way.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:41.508
Not that giant pufta.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:43.210
No, he gets way too much credit

01:24:43.212 --> 01:24:44.445
for this kind of shit as it is.

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:46.346
- I don't know, man, he might be
right.

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.083
Durant would probably
know what to do with this.

01:24:50.453 --> 01:24:52.686
- No, wait, you sayin'
I don't know what to do?

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:54.822
- You literally just said that
you didn't

01:24:54.824 --> 01:24:56.690
and that Durant's got his,
what do people call it,

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.492
you know, his fist in the pulse.

01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:01.728
- God, finger, finger
on the pulse, you fool.

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:04.932
Fuckin' idiot, he doesn't.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.234
He doesn't have his finger
on the pulse of anything.

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:09.770
He might his finger jammed
up some dude's ass, huh?

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:12.306
Yeah, might have it like
that, you know, come on.

01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:15.375
That's funny, he does,
finger, up some dude's ass.

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.882
This old girl,
she's cleanin' up real nice.

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:24.718
Hey, this chandelier, I
got this at a garage sale.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.687
Gonna put that right here.

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:29.156
I like that right there, I like
that.

01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:31.008
Whoa, whoa, what the
fuck?

01:25:31.009 --> 01:25:32.859
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, Talkie, Talkie.

01:25:32.862 --> 01:25:34.628
Right, right, right, yeah, yeah.

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.296
I have no idea what you're doing

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.465
or what you're saying, man, all
right?

01:25:39.435 --> 01:25:40.601
What do you want?

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:41.768
Can't you see we're busy right
now?

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:43.237
We're tryin' to work on these
houses.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:44.705
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:25:44.707 --> 01:25:46.673
We just painted this wall.

01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:49.810
Like I said, I'm a very
busy man at the moment.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.314
Talkie, yes, but can't you
just write this out for me

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.749
on a pad or something?

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:56.683
Listen, Lake, can y'all give me,
give me--

01:25:56.685 --> 01:25:57.885
Mm.

01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:04.158
- Wait, oh, shit.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.425
You're illiterate, too.

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:08.095
A one-eyed mute motherfucker,

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.763
and you can't read or write,
neither?

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:12.566
Damn, son, what the hell
happened to you?

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:17.304
So, eh, Talkie, eh, I'm sorry.

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.739
Look, hey, look at me, man.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.408
Don't you got an address for me,
at least?

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.676
Gimme an address, right.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:26.914
No, no, Talkie, I meant
with a pen and paper, man.

01:26:26.916 --> 01:26:28.582
No, fuck it.

01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.653
All right, so you're illiterate,

01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:36.323
and you can still do
this whole numbers thing.

01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:38.225
Shit's fascinating.

01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:41.228
237, okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:42.896
You're not talkin' about
my drum pad, are you?

01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:44.898
- Whoa, what about the drum pad,
boss?

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.936
- Let me try and decipher
this whole cave scroll shit

01:26:48.938 --> 01:26:50.737
that you're doin' on my wall
here.

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:53.307
I gotcha three people here.

01:26:53.309 --> 01:26:54.308
Are they dancing?

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:56.510
Are they fighting?

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:01.448
They're fucking?

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:03.917
In my drum house?

01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:07.754
Wait, so three people are kind
of fucking

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:09.456
in my empty swimming pool?

01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:12.726
Well, well, oh shit, Talkie.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:15.329
Please tell me no one's
gettin' raped right now.

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:21.468
All right, yeah, I got it, I got
it.

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:23.637
Yeah, this is interesting, for
sure.

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:25.505
All right, it's concerning as
hell.

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:26.773
But it's not pressing, all
right?

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:28.575
All right, yeah Talkie,

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.244
go lookin' out, man, all right?

01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:31.712
Listen, you're gonna be rewarded
for this

01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:33.847
if this turns out to
be anything, all right?

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:36.950
But right now, we gotta get
back to work, all right?

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:37.985
Talkie, gotta get back--

01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:39.987
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:27:39.989 --> 01:27:42.889
You don't advance on a man
unless you can back it up.

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.524
Can you back it up, Valkyrie?

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.562
- Hey, whoa, hey, chill,
chill, chill, man.

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:49.563
What does he want?

01:27:49.565 --> 01:27:50.781
- What the fuck, dude?

01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:51.998
You hit him in his only good
eye.

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:54.601
Dude, you're fucked up.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.304
- Yeah, I'm fucked up.

01:27:57.306 --> 01:28:00.007
Don't be pesky, all
right?

01:28:00.009 --> 01:28:01.708
Nobody likes pesky.

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:03.577
I told you, I'll get to this
matter

01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:04.745
when I'll get to it.

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:05.912
Right now, I just need you to
get the fuck

01:28:05.914 --> 01:28:06.980
out of my house.

01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:13.720
Uh, uh, uh, Talkie, not
before you fix this shit.

01:28:16.292 --> 01:28:17.891
The wall ain't gonna paint
itself.

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:22.429
Oh, shit.

01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:28.001
What y'all doing, don't
y'all know what that was?

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:31.938
- I ain't scared to
death, you know, I wasn't.

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.775
- Yeah, yeah, don't nobody read
here?

01:28:34.777 --> 01:28:37.678
Yo, that was one fast-assed
jet breakin' the sound barrier

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.046
was what that was.

01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:41.481
Yeah, a huge pressure that moves
in front

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.383
and behind the moving object,

01:28:43.385 --> 01:28:45.886
and it causes a huge burst of
energy.

01:28:45.888 --> 01:28:47.754
That shit is fascinating.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:49.756
It was right on time, too.

01:28:49.758 --> 01:28:50.991
But yeah, we behind schedule,

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:52.893
so y'all, let's get back to
work.

01:28:52.895 --> 01:28:56.697
You too, Talks, paint that shit
up.

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:05.505
Huh, people kinda fucking
in my swimming pool.

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:09.109
It's interesting for sure,
but it's not pressing.

01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:11.078
Got it?

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.012
- Yeah, boss.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:14.114
Gentral fa cation, we go
inside--

01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:17.651
- No, man, gentrification, all
right?

01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:19.419
It's when upscale hipsters move
in

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:20.854
and prices everyone else out.

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:25.559
- So is that why we're fixin'
up all these old houses?

01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:26.493
- Exactly.

01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:28.006
- All right.

01:29:28.007 --> 01:29:29.518
- We're squattin' in all these
shitholes

01:29:29.519 --> 01:29:31.030
and makin' some improvements
wherever we can, all right,

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.899
and then when the economy
recovers,

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:34.768
property values in the area
rise.

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:38.472
- Thanks to generalication.

01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:39.573
Could we go in there, we relax--

01:29:39.575 --> 01:29:42.476
- Gentrification, yes.
- Jesus.

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.044
- We'll be the rightful owners,

01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:45.979
and then we cash in, all right?

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:48.648
We're squattin' and flippin'
like motherfuckers now.

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:50.550
We cash in later, it's all
cyclical.

01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:53.019
- It's all cycle skull

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.422
'cause he, 'cause crazy smart.

01:29:55.424 --> 01:29:56.957
That's why he's the boss.

01:29:56.959 --> 01:29:59.393
- Look, you ain't gotta
worry about that, all right?

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:01.528
Just squattin', flip with me,

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:04.030
and you'll be just fine, trust
me.

01:30:04.032 --> 01:30:05.699
- Can do, boss.

01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:09.436
- Boys, but I don't know
what we about to see in here,

01:30:09.438 --> 01:30:11.004
but my interested is piqued.

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:13.807
When was the last time
y'all heard me say that?

01:30:13.809 --> 01:30:14.674
- I don't remember.

01:30:14.676 --> 01:30:15.976
- Exactly.

01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:18.712
People kinda having sex in my
pool?

01:30:18.714 --> 01:30:19.679
Makes one wonder.

01:30:21.617 --> 01:30:22.816
- Makes me kinda horny.

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.521
- Finger, finger on the pulse,
you fool.

01:30:27.523 --> 01:30:29.022
And he doesn't, he doesn't have
his finger

01:30:29.024 --> 01:30:30.991
on the pulse of anything.

01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:33.660
He might have his finger
jammed up some dude's ass, huh?

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:35.195
Yeah, might have it like that,

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:38.532
but he doesn't have his finger
on the pulse of nothin'.

01:30:38.534 --> 01:30:40.867
What, what, that was a little
funny.

01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:43.603
Finger, up some dude's
ass, 'cause he's gay?

01:30:47.058 --> 01:30:49.442
- Wrong, my finger's a-dancin'
through the victorious breeze

01:30:49.445 --> 01:30:52.779
in the crushing defeat in the
wake of your punk-ass face.

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:55.449
- But it was just us chickens.

01:30:57.019 --> 01:30:59.786
- What the fuck.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.888
That is the question.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.090
Oh, hold on.

01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:06.159
You have got the littlest dick

01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:07.661
I have ever seen, my man.

01:31:07.663 --> 01:31:08.962
Hold on, hold on, now hold it.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:12.599
You are just a little fella.

01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:14.868
Know that I've got you now and
forever

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.770
up in my cloud.

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:18.538
Hey, cover yourself up.

01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:21.842
- Thank you.

01:31:22.845 --> 01:31:24.544
- None of this is right.

01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:27.113
It don't look right,
and it don't feel right.

01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:29.316
- No, no, you're right.

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:31.518
This is a completely fucked-up
situation.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.787
But Frank and I were handling
it.

01:31:33.789 --> 01:31:35.555
- You call this handling it?

01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:38.058
These white boys laying
on the bottom of my pool?

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.693
My man over here with his dick
out.

01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:41.345
Look like he's sunbathing for an
up

01:31:41.346 --> 01:31:42.996
and coming nudist event.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:46.199
Listen, what the fuck is this
noise

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:47.567
comin' from my house?

01:31:47.569 --> 01:31:48.835
- Told you I heard something.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.270
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

01:31:50.272 --> 01:31:51.771
No one's talkin' to you.

01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:53.857
- Who is that, what's going on?

01:31:53.858 --> 01:31:55.942
- You motherfuckers don't
know how to end shit, do you?

01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:58.245
You got closing skill issues.

01:31:58.247 --> 01:32:01.047
- Oh God, I think I know what
that means.

01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:05.051
- Uh, what do you think that
means?

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:07.821
- You're gonna kill us, aren't
you?

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:12.259
- That's hilarious.

01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:14.227
The fag's a racist.

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:15.161
Fuck you!

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:16.263
- What did you just say?

01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:20.600
- Yeah, no, no, before you got
here,

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.186
the fruit roll-up there,

01:32:23.187 --> 01:32:24.703
he was talkin' about black dudes

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.207
and how they like to kill people
for fun.

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.209
- No, what, no I wasn't.

01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:32.846
- Yeah, yeah, he was using
the Nig word and everything.

01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:34.348
- Yeah.

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:35.849
- I'm not takin' sides here, but
he was.

01:32:36.818 --> 01:32:37.784
- Bullshit, shut the fuck up.

01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:38.985
- Shut the fuck up, Tiny Dick.

01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:41.004
- Yeah, no, no, no.

01:32:41.005 --> 01:32:43.022
All of this, all of this
is the fruit roll-up's

01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:45.191
some sort of revenge scheme, you
know,

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:46.793
against the two jocks.

01:32:46.795 --> 01:32:50.764
That and some sort of
a fucked-up experiment.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.567
- Experiment?

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.335
- Yeah, experiment, a fag
experiment.

01:32:55.337 --> 01:32:57.304
And one of 'em's a fag.

01:32:57.306 --> 01:32:59.239
Look at him, check the boner.

01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:00.206
He gets, wha!

01:33:01.944 --> 01:33:02.976
- We got a closet homo on our
hands?

01:33:04.295 --> 01:33:05.611
- Shut your filthy, fuckin'
mouth.

01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:09.883
We don't use the fag word
around here any more.

01:33:09.885 --> 01:33:10.750
- Okay.

01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:11.985
- Where's the closet homo?

01:33:12.988 --> 01:33:14.054
I'm just nervous.

01:33:14.056 --> 01:33:15.839
- Fuck you, Nervous.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.623
You're a latent homosexual,
you're fucking gay.

01:33:18.627 --> 01:33:20.143
- He's right.

01:33:20.144 --> 01:33:21.660
- You love dicks, and you lie
about it.

01:33:21.663 --> 01:33:24.698
Oh, yes Brad, ah, ah,
ah, ah--

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.067
- Okay, yeah, yeah, enough,
enough!

01:33:28.637 --> 01:33:30.770
What's with this one, is
he on drugs or something?

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:31.938
- Adderall.

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:33.607
- Fuckin' white boy drugs.

01:33:33.609 --> 01:33:35.642
All right, y'all
motherfuckers done fucked up

01:33:35.644 --> 01:33:37.344
by choosing my crib to do
whatever it is the fuck

01:33:37.346 --> 01:33:38.612
y'all doin' here.

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:39.346
Yup.

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:45.785
Damn, the dicks
be busy up in this bitch.

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.322
God, y'all playin some
cowcocks and lesbians.

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:51.024
Yeah, but there's a problem.

01:33:51.026 --> 01:33:53.393
'Cause this here is my bitch.

01:33:53.395 --> 01:33:55.996
Bullshit, you don't
own this house.

01:33:55.998 --> 01:33:59.265
- About to, ever heard
of squatter's rights?

01:33:59.267 --> 01:34:03.203
- Yeah, and um, what's that
genification?

01:34:04.339 --> 01:34:06.806
- Listen, y'all depraved
motherfuckers

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.342
are currently desecrating my
drum pad.

01:34:09.344 --> 01:34:12.345
- Drum room, what is this,
what is the drum room?

01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:14.914
- Explain it to him.

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:16.916
- We got a drum room upstairs.

01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:18.652
It's soundproofed and
everything.

01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:20.332
- Really?

01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:22.011
- Yeah, we like to
relax with a drum circle

01:34:22.012 --> 01:34:23.690
after a long day of flippin',
you know.

01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:24.708
- It's important.

01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:25.725
Yeah.

01:34:25.727 --> 01:34:27.160
- Hey, yo, Talkie, Talkie.

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:29.129
Hey, shut the shit down, will
you?

01:34:30.365 --> 01:34:32.332
What I'm getting at is this, all
right?

01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:34.100
As fucked up as all this is

01:34:34.102 --> 01:34:35.702
with your dicks hangin' out,

01:34:35.704 --> 01:34:37.404
all right, these Chinese finger
traps,

01:34:37.406 --> 01:34:40.440
this is just a footnote and for
what we're doin', all right?

01:34:40.442 --> 01:34:43.343
Just a tiny blip on the
proverbial map.

01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:46.379
What we're doing is gonna
change this neighborhood.

01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:47.981
Not just talk about for a day,

01:34:47.983 --> 01:34:51.251
and not just shared with
a link for a quick laugh.

01:34:51.253 --> 01:34:54.287
You small-time bitches think too
small.

01:34:55.257 --> 01:34:58.725
So get the fuck out of my house.

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:04.464
What the fuck was that?

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:07.467
- Here she comes.

01:35:10.305 --> 01:35:12.338
- And here who comes?

01:35:17.412 --> 01:35:20.847
- Who the fuck are you?

01:35:20.849 --> 01:35:23.083
- Okay, not my djembe.

01:35:23.085 --> 01:35:24.417
Listen, of all the drums up
there,

01:35:24.419 --> 01:35:26.219
you gotta grab my djembe?

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:27.821
- You like this drum, do you?

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.157
- There's just cowcocks and
lesbians.

01:35:31.159 --> 01:35:32.726
- I'm not a lesbian.

01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:34.427
- Yeah, well, whatever.

01:35:34.429 --> 01:35:36.196
- Well, this drum's about to be

01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:38.131
a really difficult puzzle

01:35:38.133 --> 01:35:39.866
if you do not let my brother go.

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:41.234
- Oh, that's savage.

01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:43.203
No need for savagery.

01:35:43.205 --> 01:35:45.138
No, eh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.173
What is this, huh?

01:35:47.175 --> 01:35:49.109
Is this an experiment in my
pool?

01:35:49.111 --> 01:35:51.511
Hey, science fascinates me, it
always has.

01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:58.918
- These two animals have
been tormenting my brother

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.487
for years with their homophobia.

01:36:00.489 --> 01:36:02.922
- Oh, oh, oh, that's just fucked
up.

01:36:02.924 --> 01:36:04.357
I've pounded on a lot of dudes.

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:05.525
Yeah, he has.

01:36:05.527 --> 01:36:06.977
- You know, I'm not gay

01:36:06.978 --> 01:36:08.428
in the conventional sense, all
right?

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.097
I'm just so hyper-masculine

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:11.765
that chicks just don't
do it for me anymore.

01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:14.167
- Oh, I get that, that makes
sense.

01:36:14.169 --> 01:36:15.535
- That's not a thing.

01:36:15.537 --> 01:36:17.303
- You care for me to
demonstrate?

01:36:17.305 --> 01:36:18.938
- Maybe.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.507
- Look, look, I beat on a lot of
dudes

01:36:20.509 --> 01:36:22.208
especially when I was ploughin'
bitches.

01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.811
But I never beat on a man
for bein' gay, all right?

01:36:24.813 --> 01:36:26.396
That's just weak.

01:36:26.397 --> 01:36:27.980
- Well, aren't you
motherfuckin' Teresa up there,

01:36:27.983 --> 01:36:30.049
you tall motherfucker, sorry.

01:36:30.051 --> 01:36:32.819
- Well, um, I'm in grad school
now, so--

01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:35.155
- No shit, where?
- Yeah, AVC.

01:36:35.157 --> 01:36:37.023
- Nice, they got a hell of a--

01:36:37.025 --> 01:36:40.026
- Psychology program.
- Psychology program.

01:36:40.028 --> 01:36:41.494
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:36:42.998 --> 01:36:44.464
- All right, so?

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:48.501
- Yeah, so my brother and I
hatched a plan

01:36:48.503 --> 01:36:52.806
to subdue this jock and
his closeted friend here.

01:36:54.376 --> 01:36:56.843
- Well, looks like you
succeeded.

01:36:56.845 --> 01:36:57.577
- Yeah, I did.

01:36:57.579 --> 01:37:00.013
- So boring, who cares?

01:37:00.015 --> 01:37:01.581
So she stuck our dicks in this
thing

01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:02.933
that is still on my dick

01:37:02.934 --> 01:37:04.284
and said we had to get
boners for each other,

01:37:04.286 --> 01:37:06.052
and I got nervous and I sprouted
one,

01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:07.087
and Brad couldn't,

01:37:07.088 --> 01:37:08.121
and now you're here and now
there's water,

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.155
and I'm tired of hearing about
it.

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:10.540
I'm just tired and hungry,

01:37:10.541 --> 01:37:11.924
and I'm just really, who cares?

01:37:15.096 --> 01:37:16.162
- You done?

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.229
- Been done, I passed the test,

01:37:17.232 --> 01:37:18.848
so get me out of here.

01:37:18.849 --> 01:37:20.465
- Hey listen, yo, don't
make me come down there.

01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:22.468
You wouldn't like it if I
were to come down there.

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:23.403
- Might.

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.474
- My uh--

01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:29.909
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait a minute, whoa.

01:37:29.911 --> 01:37:33.613
- As I was saying, my
thesis was simple enough.

01:37:33.615 --> 01:37:35.582
Set out to prove or disprove

01:37:35.584 --> 01:37:38.284
whether or not homosexuality was
a choice

01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.153
or a predisposition at birth.

01:37:40.155 --> 01:37:42.205
- And to go viral.

01:37:42.206 --> 01:37:44.256
- Not to go viral, it
was never to go viral.

01:37:44.259 --> 01:37:46.926
It was for my thesis and
for your vengeance, sure,

01:37:46.928 --> 01:37:49.362
but never to go fucking viral.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:50.780
- It's not too late.

01:37:50.781 --> 01:37:52.197
Anyone who wants to go
viral, stand up now.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.333
We can overpower them.

01:38:03.078 --> 01:38:04.077
- You suck.

01:38:12.153 --> 01:38:15.288
- All right, y'all, just
let him go, all right?

01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:17.190
He'll come back, he always does.

01:38:17.192 --> 01:38:19.459
It's not like he's gonna
be talkin' to anybody.

01:38:22.046 --> 01:38:24.630
- You know, we might have
actually gotten some good stuff.

01:38:24.633 --> 01:38:26.366
If it wasn't for this one,

01:38:26.368 --> 01:38:29.669
locking me up over his
own ridiculous agenda.

01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:31.571
- Hey well, you're out, now.

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:33.439
- I couldn't get the subjects
to sign the releases.

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:37.343
- Releases, no, no, we
can get you releases.

01:38:37.345 --> 01:38:39.112
- Oh God, I know what that
means.

01:38:39.114 --> 01:38:40.947
He's gonna cut off their
hands and sign for them,

01:38:40.949 --> 01:38:43.149
then what, cut off mine
just 'cause he can?

01:38:46.454 --> 01:38:49.155
- Listen, your brother is an
idiot.

01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:51.324
- Yeah, I know.

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:53.993
It's the drugs.

01:38:53.995 --> 01:38:55.695
I had no idea how bad it had
gotten,

01:38:57.432 --> 01:39:00.099
coupled with the trauma,

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:02.502
family and personal for the both
of us.

01:39:02.504 --> 01:39:05.071
I got my period when I was 12.

01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:07.307
It was a traumatic time for me.

01:39:07.309 --> 01:39:09.108
For Orin, too.

01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:10.977
Tried to explain to him that,
you know,

01:39:10.979 --> 01:39:13.179
my parts are my parts and
his parts are his parts,

01:39:13.181 --> 01:39:14.681
but he had a really hard time

01:39:14.683 --> 01:39:16.349
understanding and accepting
that.

01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:18.985
- Like, that's, that's
unfortunate.

01:39:21.222 --> 01:39:22.555
- Sorry, baby brother.

01:39:31.733 --> 01:39:33.566
- But I won't get into that
right now.

01:39:33.568 --> 01:39:35.335
- Yeah, all right, well look.

01:39:35.337 --> 01:39:37.170
This is how this is gonna go
down.

01:39:37.172 --> 01:39:39.505
All this stuff here, it's now
mine.

01:39:41.376 --> 01:39:42.608
- Then the drum goes down.

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:45.645
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me
finish.

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:48.147
Except for what's yours, all
right?

01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:49.749
I'm assuming you got, like, a
laptop

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:52.085
with all your important
docs and such shit?

01:39:53.088 --> 01:39:54.254
- I do.

01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:55.421
- Okay, well, you keep that.

01:39:55.423 --> 01:39:58.057
Your brother's shit, it's now
mine.

01:39:58.059 --> 01:39:59.726
It's probably all stolen,
anyhow.

01:39:59.728 --> 01:40:01.094
Might be.

01:40:10.071 --> 01:40:15.074
Hey, yo, what the fuck, man?

01:40:15.076 --> 01:40:16.376
- Woo, now I got the knife,

01:40:16.378 --> 01:40:18.378
now, I'm in charge,
motherfuckers.

01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.313
Yeah, yeah, Frank,
you got this!

01:40:20.315 --> 01:40:21.247
- Thank Hank.

01:40:22.117 --> 01:40:26.285
First of all, all this, ours.

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:27.653
All this shit is ours.

01:40:27.655 --> 01:40:30.590
Even your little school laptop,
you bitch.

01:40:30.592 --> 01:40:33.226
Second of all, who wants
to get cut first, huh, hm?

01:40:34.796 --> 01:40:37.430
What about you, a little bit
of the old in and out, eh?

01:40:37.432 --> 01:40:40.033
How about you, you wanna
get cut, faggot, huh?

01:40:40.035 --> 01:40:41.734
It's what I thought, scared
little bitch.

01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:45.038
- Yeah he is, he's a
bitch, you got this Frank.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.339
- Does he?

01:40:46.341 --> 01:40:48.541
I know I should care, but I
don't.

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:50.410
I got no stake in anybody down
here.

01:40:50.412 --> 01:40:51.444
- Oh, yeah?

01:40:51.446 --> 01:40:53.579
Yeah, you don't care, okay.

01:40:53.581 --> 01:40:55.681
He don't care, Hank, he don't
care, huh?

01:40:55.683 --> 01:40:58.718
See if you care about your
little boyfriend here, huh?

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.453
- Don't you touch him, you son
of a bitch!

01:41:00.455 --> 01:41:04.557
- Boyfriend, son, you're all
fucked up.

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:09.195
- I just did the math,
you got no angle, Frank.

01:41:09.197 --> 01:41:10.329
We're fucked.

01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:11.697
- I will smash this drum.

01:41:13.234 --> 01:41:14.834
- I don't care.

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.435
- I do, I care more about that
drum

01:41:16.438 --> 01:41:17.770
than anybody down here.

01:41:17.772 --> 01:41:19.572
No need to be so, oh, shit.

01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:21.574
Oh, does that make me a terrible
person?

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.209
- Yes, yes, it does.

01:41:23.211 --> 01:41:25.478
Boss, no it doesn't.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.347
That drum is very important to
you,

01:41:28.349 --> 01:41:30.933
so fuck them.

01:41:30.934 --> 01:41:33.518
- No, those drums are
important to all of us.

01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:37.356
You know, just in case, I'm
gonna go check

01:41:37.358 --> 01:41:40.393
to make sure they're okay.

01:41:42.197 --> 01:41:44.831
- Look, you carve this boy, and
then what?

01:41:44.833 --> 01:41:46.332
You got no recourse.

01:41:47.202 --> 01:41:48.701
- He's right, Frank.

01:41:48.703 --> 01:41:49.802
You got no resource.

01:41:50.805 --> 01:41:52.171
- Well, I'm not really sure

01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:54.140
what the word fuckin' recourse
means,

01:41:54.142 --> 01:41:56.676
but I'm pretty sure I
got the drum recourse.

01:41:56.678 --> 01:41:58.277
You know what,
you're right, Frank.

01:41:58.279 --> 01:41:59.679
You got the drum recourse, use
it.

01:41:59.681 --> 01:42:01.981
I plan to.

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:04.282
- Hey, you ever think
about bad things happening

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:05.318
to bad people?

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.986
- Huh, what?

01:42:06.987 --> 01:42:08.653
- Yeah, I think that's
what we're about to see.

01:42:08.656 --> 01:42:13.259
But the idea, please, be
careful with my djembe.

01:42:14.562 --> 01:42:17.864
Ow, ow, fuck!

01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:23.903
- And there it is.

01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:26.572
- Frank, Frank, you okay?

01:42:26.574 --> 01:42:27.573
- Fuckin' asshole.

01:42:27.575 --> 01:42:31.577
- I'm disfigured, the Nazi has
marked me!

01:42:31.579 --> 01:42:33.613
He's disfigured me, he's ruined
me, he's--

01:42:33.615 --> 01:42:35.181
- Hey, you believe in fate?

01:42:35.183 --> 01:42:36.516
It's not just
a scratch, fuck you,

01:42:36.518 --> 01:42:38.151
- What?
- It's just a scratch.

01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:39.385
- No.

01:42:39.387 --> 01:42:41.771
- Me neither,

01:42:41.772 --> 01:42:44.156
but all of this, all of this is
fortuitous

01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:45.258
if not serendipitous.

01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:50.530
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:42:50.532 --> 01:42:51.831
hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:42:51.833 --> 01:42:52.865
Like, whoa.

01:42:52.867 --> 01:42:54.500
- You tryin' to run boy?

01:42:54.502 --> 01:42:57.436
No, we're not nearly done with
you.

01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:43.749
What the fuck
is this?

01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:47.887
Dylan, I would fuck you before
I would fuck this loser.

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:51.857
Dylan, I would fuck you
in a box, in my socks,

01:43:51.859 --> 01:43:55.561
in a bar, in a car, this is
fucking bullshit, this is,

01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:58.664
I just turned him into a gay
celebrity.

01:44:01.502 --> 01:44:04.020
While some may view

01:44:04.021 --> 01:44:06.539
this method as provocative
or needlessly elaborate,

01:44:06.541 --> 01:44:08.741
I can assure you that
this scenario proved to be

01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:12.278
the most direct and effective
means of drawing a conclusion

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.881
to this sensitive and ultimately
controversial question.

01:44:17.852 --> 01:44:20.519
- Fuck you, you black bastard.

01:44:20.521 --> 01:44:23.823
No, no, no

01:44:23.825 --> 01:44:26.525
- It's science, baby, I love it.

01:44:28.896 --> 01:44:32.331
- Oh, fuck, oh, fuck you, fuck
you.

01:44:32.333 --> 01:44:33.933
- You lucky I'm not sadistic.

01:44:33.935 --> 01:44:35.885
I'd be strappin' your dicks

01:44:35.886 --> 01:44:37.836
into this urine-soaked
dingletrap if I were.

01:44:37.839 --> 01:44:39.839
You get a freshie.

01:44:39.841 --> 01:44:41.474
- Is that right, Mandingo?

01:44:41.476 --> 01:44:43.509
Well, if I wasn't
strapped all to this shit,

01:44:43.511 --> 01:44:45.945
I'd fuckin' Shaka Zulu this
shit right up your ass, huh?

01:44:45.947 --> 01:44:47.614
What do you think about that?

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:49.282
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

01:44:49.283 --> 01:44:50.950
- Actually, you know what?
- No, no, man, come on, man.

01:44:50.952 --> 01:44:53.386
- Dude, come on, no, no, no.
- Yes.

01:44:53.388 --> 01:44:54.987
- No, no, no, no.
- Guys, yeah.

01:44:54.989 --> 01:44:57.523
- Oh, oh God.
- Oh, God.

01:44:57.525 --> 01:44:58.791
It's really bad.

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.058
It's really bad, Hank.
- Oh.

01:45:00.061 --> 01:45:01.560
- We're just about set down
here.

01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:05.231
- Now while my initial aim

01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:07.533
was to answer a question
that is largely rhetorical,

01:45:07.535 --> 01:45:10.403
"Is homosexuality a choice?",

01:45:10.405 --> 01:45:12.105
I stumbled upon a new query.

01:45:12.106 --> 01:45:13.806
- To prove or disprove that
homosexuality is a choice

01:45:13.808 --> 01:45:15.808
like you say it is.

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:16.742
Hit it, Talkie.

01:45:19.414 --> 01:45:20.513
This next track here

01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:22.048
runs about 22 minutes long.

01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:22.982
- With both control groups,

01:45:22.984 --> 01:45:24.750
a common result occurred.

01:45:24.752 --> 01:45:27.987
Closeted homosexuality
resulted in latent aggression

01:45:27.989 --> 01:45:31.590
and overt violence towards
others that are openly gay.

01:45:32.694 --> 01:45:35.027
- Science, baby, I love it.

01:45:36.064 --> 01:45:37.363
Fuck.

01:45:37.365 --> 01:45:38.898
- Whoa, whoa, what, what, what?

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.334
Did I screw something up down
here?

01:45:41.336 --> 01:45:43.336
- We have another sprouter.

01:45:43.338 --> 01:45:45.805
And while this is,
admittedly, a limited sample,

01:45:45.807 --> 01:45:47.773
it does beg the question of
whether or not

01:45:47.775 --> 01:45:50.009
this is worthy of further study.

01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:51.811
Uh, what, what is that,

01:45:51.813 --> 01:45:54.113
what is touching me, what is
touching me?

01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:56.882
Hank?

01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:01.988
- That's little Hank.

01:46:01.989 --> 01:46:03.456
- God no, no, get me out of
here,

01:46:03.458 --> 01:46:05.024
get me out of this right now.

01:46:05.026 --> 01:46:06.759
Get me out, you fucker.

01:46:06.761 --> 01:46:08.361
- Would you shut the fuck up?

01:46:08.363 --> 01:46:10.085
I'm havin' a moment here, do you
mind?

01:46:10.086 --> 01:46:11.808
- No, there's no moment,
there's not a moment.

01:46:11.809 --> 01:46:13.531
- Now, I'd like to open
the floor to any questions.

01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:27.880
Yeah, um, you put
their, um,

01:46:29.684 --> 01:46:32.985
their genitals in what?

01:46:36.591 --> 01:46:40.893
Shit then.

01:46:49.003 --> 01:46:51.103
- Come on, man, Talks back
there.

01:46:51.105 --> 01:46:53.072
Check out my man Talks back
there.

01:46:53.074 --> 01:46:54.106
Yeah.

01:46:59.414 --> 01:47:00.513
- Just feel it.

01:47:00.515 --> 01:47:03.048
- Uh, I'm tellin' you all, man,

01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:06.152
this house right here is gonna
be a joint.

01:47:06.154 --> 01:47:07.870
It's fine.

01:47:07.871 --> 01:47:09.587
- Oh, this joint right
here's gonna be the joint.

01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:11.107
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:47:11.108 --> 01:47:12.625
- You got it, you got it back,
we got it.

01:47:12.627 --> 01:47:14.927
- Yeah, you know what I'm
sayin'?

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:16.629
You all got it.

01:47:16.631 --> 01:47:18.548
Can do.

01:47:20.468 --> 01:47:21.734
- I'm tired of it, man.

01:47:21.736 --> 01:47:23.469
I don't know, I'm tired, but
yeah,

01:47:23.471 --> 01:47:25.471
you wanna make this
money with us if you can.

01:48:17.024 --> 01:48:19.024
More than you can tell.

01:48:20.528 --> 01:48:22.194
Boy get it done, man.

01:48:28.069 --> 01:48:30.536
You know what, we ought
to start a band, too.

01:48:30.538 --> 01:48:31.203
We could go on the road.

01:48:31.205 --> 01:48:32.137
Cash money bag.

01:48:33.841 --> 01:48:37.810
Givin' away, they ain't gonna
owe us money after this.

01:48:37.812 --> 01:48:38.844
- You got it, dude.
