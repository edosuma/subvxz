00:05.439 --> 00:07.040
I'm a logical thinker.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.501
Paranormal's not
something in my vocabulary.

00:09.502 --> 00:11.229
- Mom.
- Did you say something?

00:11.230 --> 00:12.212
No.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.747
Is there somebody in my house?

00:13.748 --> 00:16.448
[Stairs creaking]

00:19.649 --> 00:21.888
We didn't know what it was.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.657
[Screams]

00:23.658 --> 00:26.893
There's a secret here. I'm scared.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.895
My family is being attacked now.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.056
[Screams]

00:31.365 --> 00:34.605
I have to do something.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.520
Mom!

00:38.544 --> 00:40.531
I wanted to protect my family.

00:40.532 --> 00:43.814
- Mom?
- But I didn't know how.

00:43.815 --> 00:48.315
Something was dragging
her to the window.

[Train whistle blows]

01:03.490 --> 01:05.170
_.

01:12.439 --> 01:17.610
I was a single mom with two
daughters, KK and Hailey.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.783
Honestly, I wasn't
looking for a relationship.

01:20.784 --> 01:24.744
It snuck up on me. I met Sergio.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.954
We tease each other a lot.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.891
They pick on me, and I pick on them.

01:30.892 --> 01:32.292
It was the bear.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.858
It made me feel really good
to hang out with the kids and

01:35.859 --> 01:37.594
feel like a father figure to them.

01:37.595 --> 01:39.519
So where... where are we going?

01:39.520 --> 01:40.770
He's really funny.

01:40.771 --> 01:44.637
He does the craziest things
just to make you laugh.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.774
I have fun with Sergio. He's
kind of like my best friend.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.846
Come on, Tonya, step on it.

01:49.847 --> 01:54.798
Things were going really well, so we
started looking to find a place to live.

01:54.799 --> 01:56.539
Home sweet home.

01:56.540 --> 01:59.163
And instantly fell in love
with the house, instantly.

01:59.164 --> 02:01.924
It was beautiful.

02:02.724 --> 02:05.770
It couldn't have been any
more perfect for our family.

02:05.771 --> 02:07.031
One, two, three.

02:07.032 --> 02:09.852
All: Happy family!

02:17.119 --> 02:20.573
We had to redecorate
the whole entire house.

02:20.574 --> 02:25.254
We decided to start
painting Hailey's room.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.317
We bought this mannequin, and
it's really nice, and I put

02:29.318 --> 02:32.318
different, like,
clothes and stuff on it.

02:32.319 --> 02:37.457
I was excited to make the room my own,
and we painted it red and made it my style.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.459
I love it. I love this color.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.107
We got to do it together,
and it was... it was a family.

02:42.108 --> 02:44.568
That's good.

02:45.486 --> 02:49.026
Girls, don't get all messy.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.070
We finished one wall.

02:53.071 --> 02:57.426
We decided it was a good time to break
for lunch, because the paint needed to dry.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.017
And we took the paint can,
and we hammered the lid down

03:00.018 --> 03:05.598
with the hammer to make sure
that everything was secure.

03:10.282 --> 03:14.722
We were gone, I think, about 45 minutes.

03:39.740 --> 03:43.040
There's paint everywhere.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.213
It's all over the walls.

03:54.214 --> 03:56.971
It's all over the carpet.

03:56.972 --> 03:59.510
And I'm a little freaked out.

03:59.511 --> 04:05.411
The lid was ripped off like somebody
ripped it off and tossed it on the floor.

04:06.629 --> 04:07.823
Did you do this?

04:07.824 --> 04:11.001
She asked me, did you touch the paint?

04:11.002 --> 04:12.758
And I said, no.

04:12.759 --> 04:14.315
Both: No, mom.

04:14.316 --> 04:17.071
The children hadn't been in the room.

04:17.072 --> 04:21.267
We couldn't make any sense of it at all.

04:21.267 --> 04:25.888
I had no logical answer
for what happened.

04:34.058 --> 04:37.025
So we went to get more paint.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.800
Sergio had to go to work.

04:38.801 --> 04:43.541
It's getting late, and
the girls are tired.

04:45.028 --> 04:48.388
I go to unlock the door.

04:49.663 --> 04:55.563
I try to nudge it open, because it's an old
house, and the door will stick sometimes.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.886
I don't understand why it's not opening.

05:00.887 --> 05:04.847
So I go and check the back door.

05:06.286 --> 05:09.190
But it's not budging either.

05:09.191 --> 05:11.483
And I call Sergio at work.

05:11.484 --> 05:13.892
Hi, Sergio, the door's locked.

05:13.893 --> 05:17.947
And he said, well, I'm not gonna
be home for another three 1/2 hours.

05:17.948 --> 05:19.230
You know, what are you gonna do?

05:19.231 --> 05:21.259
Girls, get back, please.

05:21.260 --> 05:27.160
I have to take drastic measures,
and I kick, and I kick, and I kick.

05:28.496 --> 05:32.636
But I finally got the door to open.

05:33.736 --> 05:37.876
The bolt was locked from the inside.

05:40.694 --> 05:42.556
I'm scared.

05:42.557 --> 05:46.133
Is there somebody in my house?

05:46.134 --> 05:49.455
And I thought about calling the
police, but I just kicked the door in.

05:49.456 --> 05:52.231
If there's somebody in the house,
they're going to be aware I'm there.

05:52.232 --> 05:53.623
Girls, wait here.

05:53.624 --> 05:58.244
So I just decided to
check it out myself.

06:07.809 --> 06:10.269
[Door creaks]

06:14.489 --> 06:19.460

through the door, I look around.

[Clattering]

06:43.418 --> 06:45.286
I felt very uneasy.

06:45.287 --> 06:48.887
I felt just extremely afraid.

07:10.845 --> 07:13.314
It's dark in the house.

07:13.315 --> 07:15.216
I'm opening doors,
looking around corners.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.694
My heart is pounding out of my chest.

07:17.695 --> 07:20.995
I'm just... I'm scared.

07:34.812 --> 07:38.112
I go to the front door.

07:43.144 --> 07:46.146
The bolt's locked there too.

07:46.147 --> 07:48.589
I was sick to my stomach.

07:48.590 --> 07:52.730
You can't lock it from the outside.

[Wood creaking]

07:56.658 --> 08:02.558
And then I hear, behind me,
somebody's coming down the steps.

08:04.194 --> 08:06.433
I kind of freeze.

08:06.434 --> 08:09.202
It sounds very lightweight.

08:09.203 --> 08:12.983
It's like a child's footsteps.

08:13.850 --> 08:16.835
I don't want to turn around.

08:16.836 --> 08:20.447
But I know that I've got to look.

08:20.448 --> 08:23.508
I slowly turn around.

08:25.487 --> 08:29.627
But there's nobody. There's nothing.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.375
I'm thinking, old homes make noises.

08:34.376 --> 08:37.256
So I dismissed it.

08:45.899 --> 08:47.112
Thank you.

08:47.113 --> 08:52.846
A couple days later, Sergio and Hailey
went out to get some drive-through.

08:52.847 --> 08:55.916
Me and mommy were in the living room.

08:55.917 --> 09:01.617
I was playing with my toys,
and she was on the computer.

09:06.227 --> 09:07.728
The TV's off.

09:07.729 --> 09:13.629
It's very quiet in our neighborhood
at that time of the day.

09:31.519 --> 09:33.153
Mom.

09:33.154 --> 09:35.589
I hear, "mom".

09:35.590 --> 09:38.091
It didn't sound like my kid.

09:38.092 --> 09:39.905
And I said, KK, did you...

09:39.906 --> 09:41.659
Did you say something?

09:41.660 --> 09:42.796
No.

09:42.797 --> 09:46.367
I asked, did you hear that?
And she said, what did you hear?

09:46.368 --> 09:48.635
And I said, a little boy saying, "mom".

09:48.636 --> 09:51.336
Right behind me.

09:52.741 --> 09:55.445
It just gives me the chills.

09:55.446 --> 09:59.406
I heard it clearly. It was scary.

It's okay.

10:10.358 --> 10:14.027
No children... there was nothing.

I had no explanation for
where this voice came from.

You scared us.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.427
Her look on her face
was... she was so startled.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.495
Did you say, mom?

10:48.496 --> 10:49.930
No.

10:49.931 --> 10:51.980
Trying to explain something,

10:51.981 --> 10:54.868
that's unexplainable is a
very difficult thing to do.

10:54.869 --> 10:57.102
We heard a little boy say, "mom".

10:57.103 --> 11:03.003
Me and Hailey looked at each other
like, what are they talking about?

11:03.478 --> 11:05.598
He just starts making
little jokes about it.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.982
Maybe it was your stomach grumbling.

- Boo.

Even though KK had heard it too, I
didn't know what to do at that point.

We just put it in the back
of our heads and moved on.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.580
One night, I was just
taking out the trash.

11:37.378 --> 11:40.498
I left the door open.

11:45.119 --> 11:49.079
It was cold outside. It was dark.

11:53.427 --> 11:57.327

12:55.961 --> 12:57.563
Locked the door? Mom!

12:57.564 --> 13:00.136
So I go to the door,
and I try to open it.

Mom!

13:01.311 --> 13:03.951
It won't open.

13:04.122 --> 13:08.442
But then I realize the bolt is locked.

13:09.102 --> 13:11.442
Let me in.

13:12.172 --> 13:13.672
Where's KK?

13:13.673 --> 13:16.783
KK couldn't have done it,
because she's too short.

13:16.784 --> 13:18.643
It's all the way up there.

13:18.644 --> 13:21.247
I left the door wide open.

13:21.248 --> 13:24.283
I didn't like that something
locked me out of my own house.

13:24.284 --> 13:26.926
- I didn't like it at all.
- It's okay. Come on.

13:26.927 --> 13:29.118
I was trying to calm her down.

voice, the paint, now the door.

I was in my room.

I had this chest. It had
black and white beads on it.

14:02.422 --> 14:05.824
I noticed beads were missing.

14:05.825 --> 14:08.432
I thought it was my sister,
because she likes to prank people.

was very sure of what she's seen.

17:54.685 --> 17:57.385
Why is he here?

17:57.657 --> 18:03.557
If it was my child, I would
want somebody to help my child.

18:04.096 --> 18:08.426
So the next day, I contacted
a local paranormal team.

18:08.427 --> 18:12.799
Hi, this sounds kind of
silly, but I've seen a ghost.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.175
They recommended that I purchase
some recording equipment...

18:16.176 --> 18:17.376
Okay.

18:17.377 --> 18:20.156
And try to communicate

I was kind of curious on what was going on.

right off onto the floor.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.594

anything, to be honest.

could with the library...

36:35.484 --> 36:37.854
- She was upset.
- There was a boy.

36:37.855 --> 36:40.555
And she says that the boy was there.

36:40.556 --> 36:43.124
She said, mommy, he looked different.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.425
He was what?

36:44.426 --> 36:46.794
She said he was badly burned.

36:46.795 --> 36:48.529
I held her. I rocked her.

36:48.530 --> 36:52.200
I told her everything was gonna be okay.

36:52.201 --> 36:55.837
I wanted to protect my family.

36:55.838 --> 37:00.098
But I didn't know how at this point.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.287
I was at the end of my rope.

37:12.288 --> 37:15.223
I couldn't handle any more.

37:15.224 --> 37:18.826
My family is being attacked now.

37:18.827 --> 37:23.664
This other spirit or whatever is taking
away everything that we've worked for.

37:23.665 --> 37:26.858
We didn't have the money
to just up and move.

37:26.859 --> 37:30.372
Everything we had was
invested in this house.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.608
There were no options.
I have to do something.

37:33.609 --> 37:34.976
[Knocking on door]

37:34.977 --> 37:37.345
- I contacted the historian...
- Hi.

37:37.346 --> 37:43.106
To see if I can get any more
information to try to help.

37:43.319 --> 37:47.080
She opened up and told me some things
that I think she intentionally kept before.

37:47.081 --> 37:49.857
J.W. Lynch wasn't all good.

37:49.858 --> 37:53.758
He also had another side to him.

37:57.433 --> 38:01.036
He had connections with Billy the Kid.

38:01.037 --> 38:04.239
And he swindled people
out of their money.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.790
He was a horrible landlord.

38:06.791 --> 38:08.876
He kicked people out just for no reason.

38:08.877 --> 38:13.222
He would just make them move right then.

38:13.223 --> 38:19.123
She said he even burned down a
house for the insurance money.

38:28.564 --> 38:30.899
Now I feel like I'm so
close to solving this puzzle.

38:30.900 --> 38:36.060
Things make more sense.
Things are coming together.

38:37.306 --> 38:40.186
The smoke detectors.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.407
The heat.

38:43.346 --> 38:45.746
The burning.

38:53.456 --> 38:58.436
What if J.W. Lynch caused
the death of Joseph?

39:04.933 --> 39:06.468
[Screams]

39:06.469 --> 39:12.049
Could this be the secret
that J.W. Lynch is protecting?

39:13.476 --> 39:16.236
Mom! Let me out!

39:25.154 --> 39:29.590
All of a sudden, something
cuts off my airway.

39:29.591 --> 39:32.411
I'm being choked.

39:36.698 --> 39:37.798
Mom?

39:37.799 --> 39:39.848
I didn't know what was going on.

39:39.849 --> 39:42.009
[Gasping]

39:42.375 --> 39:46.395
Her legs were barely on the floor.

39:47.809 --> 39:50.029
[Coughing]

39:50.418 --> 39:54.078
I was dragged from the couch.

39:54.283 --> 39:57.103
I'm being pulled.

40:00.489 --> 40:01.722
[Coughing]

40:01.723 --> 40:03.925
I can't do anything.

40:03.926 --> 40:05.786
Mom?

40:07.086 --> 40:12.986
I tried to stop myself and pull
myself up, but I kept going.

40:14.670 --> 40:15.803
Hailey!

40:15.804 --> 40:17.844
Hailey!

40:20.584 --> 40:26.281
I saw my mom being picked up and
lifted and dragged across the room.

40:26.282 --> 40:27.748
Mom!

40:27.749 --> 40:32.120
It was kind of like
someone was picking her up.

40:32.121 --> 40:33.121
[Glass shatters]

40:33.122 --> 40:35.723
We didn't know how to help her.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.559
[Clattering]

40:37.560 --> 40:39.594
The girls are screaming.

40:39.595 --> 40:41.262
Mom!

40:41.263 --> 40:45.763
Something was dragging
her to the window.

40:46.635 --> 40:50.775
She went face first into the window.

40:54.836 --> 40:56.876
[Music]

40:58.604 --> 41:00.058
Mom!

41:00.059 --> 41:01.739
_.

41:05.311 --> 41:08.131
Whatever had me...

41:08.176 --> 41:11.056
Was threatening me.

41:11.117 --> 41:14.892
It's gonna let me know
that it can hurt me.

41:14.893 --> 41:17.101
I'm so terrified.

41:17.102 --> 41:22.802
If it can do it to me, what
can it do to my daughters?

41:29.670 --> 41:33.206
But then I felt very angry.

41:33.207 --> 41:38.547
This is something I've
worked for. This is my home.

41:39.780 --> 41:44.940
No matter what, I'm going
to take my house back.

41:46.487 --> 41:50.357
I realize that in J.W. Lynch's
time, it was the Wild West.

41:50.358 --> 41:56.258
This isn't the wild, Wild West
anymore, and he's not welcome here.

42:01.501 --> 42:04.321
I'm evicting him.

42:04.954 --> 42:06.634
_.

42:11.409 --> 42:13.089
_.

42:22.326 --> 42:25.142
It's an awful thing to go through.

42:25.143 --> 42:27.773
But once you're past it you
feel stronger, you feel stronger,

42:27.774 --> 42:33.099
and you feel like you can handle
things better than you did before.

42:33.100 --> 42:39.000
I'm just glad nothing's bad anymore
and things are good and we're...

42:39.077 --> 42:41.770
Just a big old happy family again.

42:41.771 --> 42:45.191
Careful, girls. Be careful.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.358
I definitely think that
I stumbled upon something

42:49.359 --> 42:52.682
that this man has hidden
for the last hundred years.

42:52.683 --> 42:56.204
And I think that he
didn't like that at all.
