WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.106
Eagle One, Eagle Two
on the move.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.441
Was this
on the itinerary?

00:09.443 --> 00:11.310
(explosion)
Sir, we got to move.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.217
What about Catherine?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.718
Ed, she's not here.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.453
What's going on?
Where the hell is my wife?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.555
Lewis, Wordy, get security
to lock it all down--

00:23.557 --> 00:25.391
all exits,
temporary red alert.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.292
Police!
Strategic Response Unit!

00:27.294 --> 00:30.195
Police! Strategic Response Unit!

00:30.197 --> 00:32.598
Is anybody in there?

00:40.474 --> 00:42.441
Dear God, please,
just say yes.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.243
Say yes to however
much they want.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.310
They don't want money.

00:45.312 --> 00:48.180
What do they want?

00:49.650 --> 00:52.251
Guys, 12-hour shift,
plenty of OT.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.453
Be grateful we're spending it
at the Royal York.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.256
Four-star hotel,
great bathrooms.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.258
Come on.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.743
It's the Millennium Forum.

01:00.744 --> 01:02.227
Smartest people in the world
are going to be there.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.228
You guys might learn something.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.097
What, standing in the lobby?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.565
Osmosis.
I live in hope.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.566
Okay?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.334
David Graham.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.836
He's our principal.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.337
We'll call him Eagle One.
You've heard of this guy, right?

01:12.339 --> 01:15.174
Tell me you read a newspaper
and you know who this guy is.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.375
Billionaire
industrial titan

01:16.377 --> 01:18.477
turned billionaire
human rights crusader.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.380
His beautiful wife Catherine--
she runs their foundation.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.381
Now, Graham's in town

01:22.383 --> 01:23.782
giving a welcome speech.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.284
There's a big fancy-shmancy
cocktail party

01:25.286 --> 01:26.752
at the hotel.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.221
The VIP guys were on 'em, but...

01:29.223 --> 01:30.255
Some bush-league rock star
showed up

01:30.257 --> 01:31.523
without his own security detail,

01:31.525 --> 01:32.691
impromptu,
and now...

01:32.693 --> 01:34.944
PARKER:
They need us.

01:34.945 --> 01:37.196
Okay? Graham gives his keynote
speech at 7:00 tonight.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.831
VIP guys get 'em back
to the airport.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.867
We go home, take out
the garbage, and walk the dog.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.036
ALL:
Aw...

01:44.037 --> 01:46.204
Come on, we don't even have
to do a recce on this thing.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.240
It's all done:
we got itinerary, floor plans,

01:48.242 --> 01:50.409
underground access,
express elevators.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.410
Look, they even have

01:51.412 --> 01:52.711
staff security checks.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.713
Sam, you're my second today.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.716
Spike, Wordy, Lewis,
you're working access.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.518
By access you mean...

01:59.520 --> 02:01.753
Exits and revolving doors.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.155
Awesome.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.424
Jules, you're primary
on the wife.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.126
Let's call her Eagle Two,
just for fun.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.127
'Cause you know why?

02:08.129 --> 02:09.628
This job is going to be fun.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.762
What about Ed?

02:10.764 --> 02:13.499
I'd say Ed's looking
pretty darn sharp.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.551
Whoa.
Whoa.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.602
Ooh, snazzy, nice.
Oh, how you doing?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.338
Could you just try to be
a little professional?

02:19.340 --> 02:20.806
(laughter)

02:20.807 --> 02:22.273
As you can no doubt surmise,
Mr. Lane

02:22.276 --> 02:23.876
is primary
on Eagle One.

02:23.878 --> 02:26.411
Jules, you're going to need
some plain clothes today.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.580
Questions?

02:29.550 --> 02:32.251
<i> Hola.</i>

02:32.253 --> 02:34.820
WOMAN:
<i> Hola, Mami.</i>

02:34.822 --> 02:36.488
<i> ¿Tienes hambre? </i>
Mm.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.424
<i>Hice pecarones</i>
<i>y todavia estan calentitos.</i>

02:39.426 --> 02:43.328
Mmm...<i> gracias.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.329
School today?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.564
No, I have work.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.766
Ah, right.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.434
Your uniform's clean.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.670
It's hanging up.
(doorbell rings)

02:53.641 --> 02:55.841
May I help you?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.376
Señora Alvarez.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.278
No, it's Andres.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.547
You must have the wrong...
Rafael Castillo.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.483
We spoke on
the telephone.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.356
ED:
How was Dallas?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.858
It was good.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.343
Saw the kid?

03:14.344 --> 03:15.827
Oh, yeah, first time
in eight years.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.329
Nice.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.931
Tell Sophie I'm sorry,
all right?

03:18.933 --> 03:19.932
For what?

03:19.934 --> 03:23.235
Extra-long shift.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.370
What? I thought tonight was
your biannual date night.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.439
She knows the drill;
we've been married 15 years.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.475
Lots of time for date night
when I'm old and feeble.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.144
What, like me?

03:32.145 --> 03:33.812
Buddy, my understanding--
you have to have a, a date

03:33.814 --> 03:35.447
before you can blow off
date night.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.482
Oh, that.
I'm just saying.

03:37.484 --> 03:41.587
<i> Pero nos prometio,</i>
<i> por telefono.</i>

03:41.589 --> 03:43.789
<i>Cambie de idea.</i>

03:43.791 --> 03:46.325
<i> No puedo arriesgarlo.</i>

03:51.465 --> 03:53.465
<i> ¿Usted puede mirar</i>
<i> a Gabriel en los ojos</i>

03:53.467 --> 03:55.601
<i> y decirle</i>
<i> que ha cambiado de idea?</i>

03:55.603 --> 03:57.869
Huh?

04:00.407 --> 04:04.276
<i> Llevamos tres meses</i>
<i> planeando esto. Para hoy.</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:07.279
<i> Pero es imposible hacerlo</i>
<i> sin usted.</i>

04:19.860 --> 04:22.427
Alandra.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.696
<i> Entre sus cuerpos.</i>

04:24.698 --> 04:28.600
<i> Su marido, el</i>
<i> padre de Felipe,</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:30.369
<i> y mi hermano.</i>

04:30.371 --> 04:32.571
<i> Yo lo suplico.</i>

04:32.573 --> 04:36.375
<i> Es lo que el</i>
<i> hubiera querido.</i>

04:36.377 --> 04:38.377
<i> Por favor.</i>

04:55.596 --> 04:57.362
<i>Lo siento.</i>

04:57.364 --> 04:58.664
<i> No puedo.</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:03.568
<i> Un momento, Rafael.</i>

05:03.570 --> 05:05.404
<i> Hace meses que lo sabe.</i>

05:05.406 --> 05:06.838
<i>No deberiamos haber confiado</i>
<i>con ella.</i>

05:06.840 --> 05:07.839
<i> ¿Y ahora que?</i>

05:07.841 --> 05:08.907
<i>No se.</i>

05:08.909 --> 05:10.542
<i>No se.</i>
<i>Necesito pensar.</i>

05:10.544 --> 05:12.978
<i> ¿Como puede dejar de</i>
<i> hacer lo que es justo?</i>

05:12.980 --> 05:16.348
<i>Felipe, calmate. </i>
<i> Espéranme, espéranme.</i>

05:19.720 --> 05:21.386
<i> Yo les ayudo.</i>

05:21.388 --> 05:23.088
<i> Yo tambien trabajo alli.</i>

05:24.692 --> 05:26.425
JULES:
<i> You sold your car?</i>

05:26.427 --> 05:28.727
It cost, like,
half a paycheck to fill up,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.696
which is the same price
as a secondhand bike.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.532
Ooh, watch out: Sam's
packing three speeds.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.566
Why not?
(chuckles)

05:34.568 --> 05:36.435
At work,
it's all zero to 60,

05:36.437 --> 05:40.972
it's all madness and bad guys
and go, go, go, hair on fire.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.508
Okay, I get it, so
then going to work...

05:43.510 --> 05:44.776
I take my time...
Oh.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.545
...take it slow...
Nice.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.980
...try to remember that people
are generally nice.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.550
So, uh, what about,
uh, the ladies?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.385
You know, picking 'em
up, taking 'em out,

05:53.387 --> 05:55.387
night on the town.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.388
You going to do
all that on a bike?
(sighs)

05:57.391 --> 05:58.623
Excuse me.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.058
WOMAN:
You told me
not to overpack.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.694
MAN:
I simply suggested we experiment
in traveling light.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.563
WOMAN:
Which is fine,
except now you want me

06:04.565 --> 06:05.597
to wear the Dior tonight.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.032
And guess what?
It's at home.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.066
You're going to
look beautiful.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.067
Doesn't matter
what you wear.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.469
Hell, wear
the bathrobe.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.537
Sexiest thing a
woman ever put on.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.139
What do you think?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.674
Oh, I agree.
See, Ed agrees.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.642
Liked him from the
moment I met him.

06:17.644 --> 06:18.477
Poor Ed.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.544
(chuckles)

06:19.546 --> 06:21.446
Sir, I'll double-check
this stuff.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.948
Of course, whatever
you need to do.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.683
This is her traveling light.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.685
And mineral water.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.753
Absolutely.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.921
Thank you, Ms. Gagnon.

06:38.966 --> 06:43.034
Danny, 313, 314, I'm gonna
take this one up myself.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.473
Hey, boss.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.977
Thanks, Jules.
No sugar.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.012
Ah...
(computer beeps)

06:54.014 --> 06:56.415
1:23 P.M.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.416
Knock on the door.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.417
Brace yourselves.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.620
Looks like room service.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.524
What?

07:05.526 --> 07:08.527
Just haven't seen you
in a suit before.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.629
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.532
Can we get
a little focus going here?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.869
Uh, sweetheart?

07:17.871 --> 07:20.205
No, you are not having
the steak frites for lunch

07:20.207 --> 07:23.542
because we had steak
last night for dinner.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.043
Thank you very much,
my dear, perfect.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.945
Thank you.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.580
It's a nice choice.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.948
My wife says the same thing.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.683
A little omega-3
and the crossword

07:31.685 --> 07:33.084
if you want to
live to be 70.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.754
She's aiming for a hundred.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.689
14 years she's been
taking care of me,

07:37.691 --> 07:40.625
and ever since I met her,
everything's better.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.228
It's usually steamed,
but it's still better.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.539
<i> Estan en la 313 y la 314.</i>

07:54.541 --> 07:56.141
<i> Dos habitaciones contiguas.</i>

07:56.143 --> 07:58.944
<i> Han reservado</i>
<i> bajo el nombre de "Gagnon."</i>

07:58.946 --> 08:00.979
<i> Es el apellido de soltera</i>
<i> de la esposa.</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:03.548
<i> Solo hay un guardaespaldas.</i>

08:03.550 --> 08:05.584
<i> Sí, sí, estoy segura.</i>

08:05.586 --> 08:06.952
<i> No hay nadie en el pasillo.</i>

08:06.954 --> 08:09.788
I'm coming down for the package.

08:09.790 --> 08:14.092
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:50.030 --> 08:52.898
Eagle One, Eagle Two
on the move.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.600
Was this
on the itinerary?

08:55.602 --> 08:57.802
Get the feeling this guy
doesn't like itineraries.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.070
Check Eagle Two, it's on hers.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.138
JULES:
Yeah,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.040
but not for
half an hour.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.941
4:00 P.M.: interview with
a journalist, library bar.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.578
Eagle One suggested they go down
early for a glass of champagne.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.564
Aw, what a guy.

09:08.565 --> 09:10.549
All right, hold on.
Hold the elevator.
I'm on my way.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.551
You got our team
on all the exits?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.670
We do.

09:14.671 --> 09:16.788
"3:34 P.M.:
Eagle One breaks from itinerary,

09:16.790 --> 09:19.324
mark as unpredictable."

09:19.326 --> 09:21.059
So what does your wife think
of all of this?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.377
All of what?

09:22.378 --> 09:23.694
Well, it's a dangerous job
you do.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.097
I mean, now, knock on wood,
not tonight, but...

09:26.099 --> 09:27.933
Right, well, she's
okay with it.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.235
Really?
Is she a police officer as well?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.670
No, she's
a caterer.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.772
This is Jules;
she's with us.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.874
Hi.
Hi.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.860
Spike,
there's an unmarked exit

09:55.862 --> 09:57.829
just opposite the front desk.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.265
"Staff only"?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.334
That's the one.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.668
SAM:
Sarge, I'm not liking the bar.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.870
Three exits--

10:04.871 --> 10:06.071
one to the street,
one to the lobby,

10:06.073 --> 10:07.839
one towards
the kitchen.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.808
Corridors running
east, west, up, down.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.843
Yeah, we've closed off access
to the street.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.345
We're about to have Jules
on the lobby door.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.146
Copy that.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.498
Be there in two.

10:16.499 --> 10:17.849
Okay, so the bar's
a little soft.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.818
What's the closest lobby exit?

10:19.820 --> 10:20.819
South.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.853
Wordy?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.623
Outside's clear. Heading in.

10:25.359 --> 10:26.958
Okay, just stay on it.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.860
Eagle One-- he likes
to wander off-course.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.062
I'll take the front exit
when they get here,

10:31.064 --> 10:32.163
and I think we're good.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.965
Ready for anything.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.976
DAVID:
We'll be gone by 8:00.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.495
Our suite's already paid for.

10:46.496 --> 10:48.013
Why don't you bring your
wife in for the night?

10:48.015 --> 10:49.114
Fridge full of champagne,
room service.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.081
Lovely idea.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.383
Very kind, very kind, but I...

10:51.385 --> 10:53.118
DAVID:
Can't take favors.
I get it.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.353
One of the ironies of having
money-- everything costs less.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.789
I'll get you my corporate rate.
It's practically free.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.157
Sir, you know,
you're very generous

10:59.159 --> 11:00.425
with the rest of the world.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.793
I just wouldn't
feel comfortable...

11:01.795 --> 11:03.094
Ed, Ed, word to the wise.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.063
Don't try and fight him
on this.
Let me guess.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.131
You don't have enough time.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.332
Tough job, long hours.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.167
You're great at what you do, Ed,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.102
but I got a few years on you.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.806
Trust me. One thing
money can't buy is enough time.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.141
Say yes.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.709
Call your wife.
I...

11:17.711 --> 11:19.010
CATHERINE:
It's a wonderful idea.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.378
Surprise her. Give her a call.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.880
Come on, go ahead.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.048
Okay. Okay.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.315
I still remember

11:24.317 --> 11:26.184
the night you flew me
to Santiago.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.054
He said it was a surprise,
told me to pack for two nights.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.056
She packed
for two weeks.
Hotel balcony.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.541
He asked me to marry him.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.025
He said he was leaving
the mining industry behind.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.160
I was working
for the Foreign Service

11:35.162 --> 11:36.461
at the time.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.931
We had known each other
a whole entire month.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.000
I will tell you
what sold me on it.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.769
He looked at me, and he said,
"I'm finally gonna do

11:44.771 --> 11:46.004
something good
with my life."

11:46.006 --> 11:47.172
That's what he said.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.173
And he was holding out a ring.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.173
I mean, what was I gonna say?

11:49.176 --> 11:50.408
(laughs)

11:50.410 --> 11:51.409
Is she not there?

11:51.411 --> 11:53.044
No. No, she didn't, uh...

11:53.046 --> 11:55.246
She didn't answer.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.249
Okay.

11:58.251 --> 12:04.789
Mrs. Graham is waiting
at her table.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.858
Señor Castillo.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.926
Lovely to meet you.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.194
Nice to meet you.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.162
Hello. I'll see you
in the room, darling.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.497
Oh. Yes.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.733
Please,
sit, sit.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.838
Eyes on Two.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.774
(phone ringing)
Sir?

12:22.776 --> 12:24.008
Go ahead.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.277
SOPHIE:
Hey, did you just call?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.779
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.080
Do you know where
that cheese shop is?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.782
You know the new one.
It's got the, um...

12:30.784 --> 12:32.984
You should know.
You ate it all. Anyway,
Cheese?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.786
I'm having Amy over tonight
since you're working late.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.287
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I think

12:36.289 --> 12:37.822
I can get us a suite tonight.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.958
You're working
at the Royal York, right?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.826
Ed, we can't afford
the Royal York.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.862
Think I can get us a deal.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.964
You can't make it,
you can't make it.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.799
Are you kidding? Room service.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.234
Date night alone
with my husband.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.169
Champagne, fresh sheets.
What time?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.804
What about Amy?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.806
Ah, she can eat
someone else's cheese.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.007
(elevator bell dings)
Clark?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.942
I'll get my mother to come over.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.911
6:00?

12:59.912 --> 13:01.879
Okay, yeah. I might be
a little bit late, but, uh...

13:01.882 --> 13:03.415
Jay?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.949
...you know, we're gonna
finish things up here,

13:04.951 --> 13:07.051
and, uh, that should
be good. All right.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.454
Okay. I'll start the champagne
and the bubble bath without you.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.955
SOPHIE:
See you then.
See you then.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.557
Nice work. Jay, nice
to see you again.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.125
Listen, I'm gonna need
a suite for tonight

13:14.127 --> 13:15.927
at my corporate rate,
but it's not for me.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.095
Oh. Of course.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.397
We've got a lovely
suite available

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
on the fourth floor.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.233
We'll get it ready
for you right now.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.518
Always happy

13:23.519 --> 13:24.802
to have a friend...
(explosion)

13:24.805 --> 13:26.437
Sir, we got to move.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.443
Stay here. I'll
be right back.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.258
Explosion, kitchen oven.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.426
Get a medic in here.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.861
May have some injuries.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.031
Oh, my God.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.200
The woman and the journalist
sitting at this table--

13:55.202 --> 13:57.335
did anybody see them leave?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.837
Jules, what's going on?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.872
Eagle Two.

14:00.874 --> 14:01.973
Ed, she's not here.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.876
I'm gonna check the bathroom.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.394
What do you mean,
not here?

14:06.395 --> 14:07.911
What's going on?
Where the hell is my wife?

14:07.914 --> 14:09.914
Hey, Spike, bomb truck.
Figure out what happened.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.517
Lewis, Wordy, get security
to lock it all down.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.986
All exits, temporary red alert.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.426
Jules, channel two.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.428
All right, Jules, talk to me.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.929
I turned my head
for three seconds,

14:24.931 --> 14:26.197
trying to figure out
where to take her.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.132
Journalist is also missing.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.034
Possible subject.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.637
I repeat, Team One,
Eagle Two is MIA.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.339
I have no contact with her.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.142
Stairwell's clear.
Lobby's clear.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.945
Tell me what is going on.
Sir, I'll keep you up to date.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.146
You're telling me
that my wife is missing,

14:42.148 --> 14:43.214
and you'll keep me up to date?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.599
What the hell is
happening here?

14:44.600 --> 14:45.983
Sir, please,
I need you to stay calm.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.118
And I need you to stay here.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.536
It's got to be
about money, right?

14:48.537 --> 14:49.953
We'll get a ransom note
in about a half an hour.

14:49.956 --> 14:50.955
We don't know that.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.124
Well, I know that.
Sir, please.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.293
Cut off gas supply
to this kitchen now

14:55.295 --> 14:57.061
and ventilate--
fans, windows, everything--

14:57.063 --> 14:59.130
before anything else blows.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.335
Let's see why this thing
didn't take the roof off.

15:05.005 --> 15:09.073
(typing)

15:09.075 --> 15:12.210
(computer chirps)

15:12.212 --> 15:15.013
Hey, there's no sign of
Eagle Two leaving the building.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.915
As far as we can tell, she's...

15:16.917 --> 15:19.150
She's still
within the perimeter.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.152
As far as the journalist...

15:21.154 --> 15:23.955
He was fully accredited
with the Millennium Forum.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.490
Unless he's a master of forgery,

15:25.492 --> 15:27.425
he writes for a small
Chilean publication.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.127
His name is Rafael Castillo.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.228
Excuse me.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.030
What are you saying?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.432
I'm saying we may be looking
at a kidnapping.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.034
Good news is, if so,

15:36.036 --> 15:37.402
she's being held
within the building.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.137
That's the good news?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.372
WORDY:
Sarge, we got guys
at every exit.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.640
That's good. Cover Spike.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.143
Ask around,
and just wait for my orders.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.047
(panting)

15:55.989 --> 15:58.056
(grunts)

16:02.062 --> 16:04.028
(gasps)

16:17.644 --> 16:20.311
PARKER:
Okay, let's break it
down, do the math.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.713
800 rooms, divided by five...

16:21.715 --> 16:23.281
No. Excuse me.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.249
809, actually.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.451
It's 160 rooms per person.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.019
Kira, get Rolie.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.754
We need Team Three here ASAP.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.255
Even if we cut these
numbers in half,

16:31.257 --> 16:32.423
we're talking 80 rooms each.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.292
JAY:
No. Absolutely not.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.761
We have 532 guests
already checked in,

16:36.763 --> 16:39.364
27 of whom are VIPs.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.465
We cannot invade their privacy.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.600
This is their home
away from home.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.702
Jay! Jay! Jay! Jay!
I've got one job.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.437
That's protect the principal.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.506
Principal's wife goes missing,
that affects the principal.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.641
See, you, on the other hand,
have two jobs.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.510
Get my guys
some master keys,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.345
and get a grip.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.384
WOMAN:
I don't know.
I was on the phone.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.551
I was talking to my mother,

17:00.553 --> 17:02.020
and then I heard
that thing go off.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.187
Mm-hmm. It's okay.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.355
It's okay. We're just...

17:04.357 --> 17:06.708
We're trying to make sure.

17:06.709 --> 17:09.060
Uh, did you see any strangers,
any guests in the staff areas?

17:09.062 --> 17:10.879
Uh-uh.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.697
Well, Claudia, if you hear
anything, if you see anything,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.632
you come speak to
one of us, all right?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.367
Uh, you said your
shift's over at 5:00.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.668
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.404
Security's gonna show you
out the staff door.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.738
Just show 'em your ID.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.813
Police! Strategic Response Unit!

17:28.815 --> 17:31.282
Anyone there?

17:33.319 --> 17:35.486
Security. Is there anyone
in there?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.723
Police! Strategic Response Unit!

17:38.725 --> 17:41.059
Is anybody in there?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.132
Good. I'm glad I caught you.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.134
You haven't left yet.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.302
Hey. Yeah, I know.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.237
I'm just getting ready.
What do you need?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.705
Soph, we can't do it
tonight. I...

17:54.707 --> 17:57.308
We're having a serious
security problem here.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.377
Okay.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.079
Are you all right?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.381
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.549
That's okay.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.317
I'll see you when you get home.

18:06.319 --> 18:10.488
DAVID:
Well, Ed, when I was still
in mining, I took over a company

18:10.490 --> 18:12.190
in Venezuela.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.225
Hostile. Got very ugly,

18:14.227 --> 18:17.662
but, Ed,

18:17.664 --> 18:20.698
you don't become what I am
by being nice to everyone.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.434
But, I mean,
this was all years ago.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.769
Well, let me ask you this.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.571
Could your wife be involved
in something?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.339
Something
that you don't know about?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.408
I... I don't know.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.410
I don't think so,

18:32.412 --> 18:35.813
but I suppose you never really
know anyone completely.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.815
Sarge, Ed, I don't like it.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.817
I got wires. I got a fuse.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.719
Explosives 101, nothing fancy.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.621
You could learn this stuff
in high school.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.623
But it's a bomb.
It's definitely a bomb.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.858
Wasn't built to kill,

18:46.860 --> 18:49.293
but it sure was a hell
of a distraction.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.863
(panting)

18:51.865 --> 18:54.365
Do you know why you're here?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.834
No.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.769
Money, I guess. I don't know.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.638
Ramon Castillo,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.774
Gabriel Alvarez,
Diego Garcia.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.309
I...

19:05.311 --> 19:07.712
Three men who were loved
by their families.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.781
Tell her.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.217
Tell her!

19:19.159 --> 19:23.227
My father--
his name was Gabriel Alvarez.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.229
We lived in Falpago, Chile.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.831
The last time
I saw him,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.699
he was standing
on our doorway.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.403
He was making my mother laugh,
even as she was crying.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.438
He was fighting for our village,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.474
to make things right.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.643
But it didn't work.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.278
They took him away.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.913
They humiliated him.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.515
They tortured him.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.585
He disappeared.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.854
I never knew
what happened to him.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.256
I'm sorry.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.358
I am.

19:54.360 --> 19:58.396
But... I don't understand
what this has to do with me.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.798
Don't! She can't
bring them back.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.503
<i>Vete. Te estaran</i>
<i>buscando. Vete.</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:23.621
(door closes)

20:25.692 --> 20:27.758
(panting)

20:31.497 --> 20:32.580
Señor Castillo...

20:32.581 --> 20:33.664
please.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.008
I'll explain how it works.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.509
Sarge?

20:45.511 --> 20:48.312
This freight elevator
hasn't moved in 20 minutes.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.914
It's worth a shot.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.416
Jules, we've got a frozen
cargo elevator in the east wing.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.784
Might be worth a look.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.685
Send Lewis, too.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.320
Copy that.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.748
(moaning, grunting)

21:23.750 --> 21:25.383
JULES:
Sarge, she's here.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.717
We got her.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.986
But we've got
a problem.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.693
Please stand back.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.727
Stand back.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.896
Okay.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.734
They called it a necklace bomb.

21:51.678 --> 21:52.743
Civilians coming through.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.778
Let them out.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.046
That's the last of them.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.548
No, sir, no,
sir, Inspector.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.949
They told her,
anyone tampers with it,

21:58.951 --> 22:00.551
anyone tries
to isolate her,

22:00.553 --> 22:02.753
get her out of
the building,

22:02.754 --> 22:04.954
they trigger the blasting
cap and sever her spine.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.757
I don't know, I...
I don't know.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.026
They also told her it was
fitted out with a camera.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.528
We can't take
that chance.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.595
Boss, that's it.

22:11.597 --> 22:12.930
Everyone's out.
The floor's secure.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.467
Three different triggers.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.570
Mercury switch,
pressure fit, and a remote.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.838
Now, if we can
disable the remote,

22:20.840 --> 22:22.440
we can deal with
everything else.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.109
And sir, if you've
got any ideas...

22:25.111 --> 22:27.778
All right, we'll
see you in a bit.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.547
Thank you.
Where is she?

22:29.549 --> 22:30.881
She's safe.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.750
She's doing well,
but we need you to stay back.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.419
If you are gonna be down here,
you're here to help us,

22:35.421 --> 22:37.521
and you need to stay back
until further notice, sir.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.556
Do you understand me?

22:38.558 --> 22:39.557
Yes.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.558
Okay, come
on, Eddie.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.559
Wordy.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.727
We'll be back.

22:42.729 --> 22:43.928
Sir.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.430
Spike says he
can't cut it

22:46.432 --> 22:47.765
until he knows
what's triggering it.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.667
Plus, they told her
there's a camera.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.770
They'd hit play if
anyone tries to cut it.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.605
We got to get them
in bomb gear.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.673
I know.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.641
They both said no.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.046
You're gonna be fine.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.748
We're all here
with you, okay?
Okay.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.951
Guys, I need ten seconds
of complete silence, okay?

23:10.857 --> 23:12.923
If she's safe, I don't
understand why I can't go in.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.759
Sir, it's for
your own safety.

23:14.761 --> 23:15.926
How is she a threat?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.862
It's not her, sir.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.500
They've got her
in a necklace bomb.

23:23.469 --> 23:24.502
Oh, my God.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.703
You've heard of these things?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.905
I lived in South America
for eight years.

23:27.907 --> 23:28.939
Yes, I've heard of them.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.040
Oh, dear God, please.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.075
Just say yes.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.710
Say yes to however much
they want.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.412
They don't want money.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.014
What do they want?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.149
JULES:
You didn't see her?

23:38.151 --> 23:40.418
You didn't see
the woman who spoke?
No.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.686
By then, I was blindfolded,
so apart from the journalist...

23:42.688 --> 23:43.821
There was nobody else in there?

23:43.823 --> 23:45.890
I don't know.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.958
Castillo was the one
who gave me the instructions.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.593
Can you give them to me again?

23:50.863 --> 23:53.631
I am to go
to the opening address at 7:00.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.699
I don't even know
what time it is now.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.536
No alarms, no changes,
no alerting the other guests.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.537
You can't be serious.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.771
That's 20 minutes from now.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.708
In front of the room,
in front of everyone,

24:04.710 --> 24:06.877
my husband is to confess.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.879
Confess to what?

24:08.880 --> 24:10.880
CATHERINE:
<i> To something about</i>
<i> his mining operations.</i>

24:10.883 --> 24:14.852
Something about a man
named Gabriel Alvarez.

24:14.854 --> 24:18.456
Gabriel Alvarez.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.458
If you tell the truth,
your wife will live.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.961
Now, that's what
they told her.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.997
Any of this
make any sense to you?

24:32.805 --> 24:34.238
Let me see her.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.773
Okay, go.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.208
Quickly.
Okay.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
(beeping)

24:49.922 --> 24:51.889
I love you.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.896
<i> Saben quien soy.</i>
<i> No puedo estar aqui.</i>

24:58.898 --> 25:00.030
This is too much.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.515
No, it's too late.

25:01.516 --> 25:02.999
There's no time to
debate this, Claudia.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.002
You cannot back out on us now.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.806
The world needs to know
what this man did.

25:10.243 --> 25:14.044
So, I give this to Felipe
in the room...

25:14.046 --> 25:15.980
and then I can go, right?

25:15.982 --> 25:17.548
Unless I don't make it in.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.016
Why wouldn't you?

25:19.018 --> 25:21.519
Security is going
to be very tight.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.688
Listen, if I don't make it in,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.757
and if Graham
lies to us,

25:26.759 --> 25:28.058
to the room,

25:28.060 --> 25:30.661
you press...

25:30.663 --> 25:32.196
this button.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.231
Okay?
RAFAEL:
But, Claudia,

25:34.233 --> 25:38.903
if the man apologizes to us,
to everyone, nothing happens.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.571
We let her go.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.040
You promise?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.675
Of course.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.013
Okay.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.218
Thank you.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.620
Claudia, your father...

25:56.622 --> 25:58.923
this... this is what
he would do.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.259
Does it have a camera?

26:02.261 --> 26:04.094
I can't tell until
we pull it apart.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.563
Is she safe
to walk around?

26:05.565 --> 26:07.097
I need a minute
to develop the X-ray,

26:07.099 --> 26:08.732
but as far
as I can tell,

26:08.734 --> 26:10.568
there's no embedded motion
sensor, no timing device.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.969
So, it needs to
be triggered?
Yeah.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.571
Found a small amount
of TNT,

26:13.573 --> 26:15.906
and there's a blasting cap
attached to a relay switch.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.141
Could be set off
by cell phone,

26:17.143 --> 26:18.776
could be set off
by shortwave remote.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.678
Okay, meaning?
Meaning, they're either
gonna call it in

26:20.680 --> 26:22.346
or they're gonna be
within the line of sight.

26:22.348 --> 26:23.564
Probably within 30 feet.

26:23.565 --> 26:24.781
What about the
people around her?

26:24.784 --> 26:25.783
It's a blasting cap.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.017
It goes off,
it breaks her neck.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.086
She's done, but it's not
gonna hurt anybody else

26:29.088 --> 26:30.521
within five, ten feet,
I'm guessing.

26:30.522 --> 26:31.955
Okay, we'll put her
up in the balcony.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.024
Meets the demands, but
keeps her out of the way.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.659
That's the best
we can do right now.

26:35.661 --> 26:38.062
Let me know.
All right.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.030
There is no guests
or staff members

26:40.032 --> 26:41.832
with the last name Alvarez.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.301
And beyond Graham
giving a public confession

26:44.303 --> 26:46.036
during his keynote speech

26:46.037 --> 26:47.770
in front of the press,
in front of the world,

26:47.773 --> 26:50.040
we don't know what these
people want or who they are.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.275
What the hell
did this guy do?

26:51.277 --> 26:53.143
His past life, in his sleep--
I don't care.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.012
The wife doesn't even know, sir.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.880
They told her that he would
understand what it was about.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.082
No, we can't risk it.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.817
60 people having drinks,
and we're gonna

26:59.819 --> 27:01.185
put a woman
in the middle of that?

27:01.187 --> 27:03.320
We keep her up in the balcony,
out of the way.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.289
Having her in the room
is part of the demand.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.824
I don't care.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.193
This guy says one wrong word,
we've got a woman

27:09.195 --> 27:10.861
being executed
at a public function.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.396
Sir, either way,
they're gonna kill her.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.998
They're not asking for money

27:14.000 --> 27:16.233
or hostages or concessions,
which means

27:16.235 --> 27:18.035
it's like war, right?
They're making a point.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.637
They're making it publicly,
and they want him

27:19.639 --> 27:20.804
to see what happens
to his wife...

27:20.806 --> 27:22.172
Not if we stop it.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.807
We've got
14 minutes.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.876
We don't have time
to do anything else.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.679
All right.

27:28.681 --> 27:29.847
Go, Sam.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.718
PARKER:
<i> We follow their instructions</i>
<i> to the letter.</i>

27:34.720 --> 27:36.887
<i> Eagle One and Eagle Two</i>
<i> go into the party.</i>

27:36.889 --> 27:39.156
<i> Eagle One does his thing,</i>
<i> as instructed.</i>

27:39.158 --> 27:41.725
<i> In the meantime...</i>

27:41.726 --> 27:44.293
<i> Spike is working </i>
<i> on electronic countermeasures,</i>

27:44.296 --> 27:47.131
jamming all cell phone signals
within a 100-meter radius.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.133
No calls in, no calls out.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.201
Don't tell me this thing
can be set off by a cell phone.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.836
Not anymore.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.405
The only other possible trigger

27:54.407 --> 27:56.974
is shortwave remote,
like a pager.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.942
What does that mean?
That the
subject has

27:58.944 --> 28:01.845
to be within the line of sight,
30 feet from Eagle Two.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.599
<i> We contain the room.</i>

28:05.600 --> 28:07.016
<i> Sam prepares</i>
<i> a less lethal solution</i>

28:07.019 --> 28:08.919
<i> because, if the weapon</i>

28:08.921 --> 28:11.088
<i> is a garage door opener,</i>
<i> we can't take that chance.</i>

28:11.090 --> 28:13.223
<i> We cannot shoot to kill.</i>

28:13.225 --> 28:16.694
We contain the room;
the subject's already arrested.

28:18.431 --> 28:20.030
All right, Greg.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.767
I'd like to talk to
my husband, please.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.907
Sweetheart.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.743
This isn't happening, okay?

28:32.745 --> 28:34.478
It's just another night.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.147
It's just me and you.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.116
You get up there
and you tell the truth,

28:39.118 --> 28:41.185
and we go home together.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.992
CATHERINE:
David... please.

28:48.994 --> 28:51.995
You can't get up there and lie.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.764
You can't try and save me

28:53.766 --> 28:57.201
by confessing to something
you didn't do,

28:57.203 --> 28:59.770
'cause what you have built,

28:59.772 --> 29:02.172
what we've
built together,

29:02.174 --> 29:06.410
if we let them destroy it
like this, it will never end.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.215
I'll see you in there?

29:11.217 --> 29:12.516
Yes.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.185
I will see you in there.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.756
I love you.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.460
With all my heart.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.174
SAM:
Sierra One in position.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.408
Copy that.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.921
Ed?

29:50.923 --> 29:52.256
ED:
We're on our way.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.457
Copy.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.896
Okay.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.330
Let's keep the peace.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.005
(murmuring)

30:25.591 --> 30:27.891
Boss, what did
this guy do?

30:29.595 --> 30:30.594
I don't know.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.162
Eagle One approaching.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.831
Got to be something
I can do, uh,

30:33.833 --> 30:34.998
somebody I can pay.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.067
Just buy us a little time
to do our job.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.268
Longer you talk, the better.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.870
Left here, sir.

30:43.108 --> 30:46.310
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Jane Renn.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.212
I'm with the Millennium Forum.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.765
I'd like to welcome you tonight,

30:50.766 --> 30:53.317
and thank you for braving the
increased security this evening.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.119
It's my pleasure to invite
tonight's speaker to join us:

30:56.121 --> 30:58.188
David Graham.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.389
He needs no introduction.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.325
(applause)
Thank you very much.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.933
Eagle Two, we're in position.

31:09.935 --> 31:11.301
Copy that.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.639
I...

31:17.610 --> 31:21.445
don't know what to say.

31:25.885 --> 31:29.419
To be honored
tonight in this way,

31:29.421 --> 31:31.889
I wish I deserved it.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.524
I do.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.593
I wish that more than anything.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.199
The nonprofit work we've done

31:42.201 --> 31:46.069
in South America
is the work I'm most proud of.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.638
Jules, any sign
of the journalist?

31:47.640 --> 31:49.172
Negative.

31:49.174 --> 31:52.242
It all began, of course,
as an idea of Catherine's.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.510
Everything does--

31:53.512 --> 31:55.212
everything good.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.482
15 years ago,

31:58.484 --> 32:00.517
we sat on a balcony in Santiago,

32:00.519 --> 32:04.154
and I promised Catherine I would
do something good with my life,

32:04.156 --> 32:07.391
if only she would just
stay with me.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.193
Magically...

32:10.195 --> 32:12.529
she agreed.

32:12.531 --> 32:16.099
And since that night,
I've never looked back.

32:16.101 --> 32:19.503
Because if I did,

32:19.505 --> 32:22.172
if I did... look back,

32:22.174 --> 32:26.209
I would see things
I can't believe I let happen.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.947
I would see ghosts.

32:29.949 --> 32:33.216
Faces.

32:33.218 --> 32:37.187
Ramon Castillo.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.256
Diego Garcia.

32:41.961 --> 32:45.429
Gabriel Alvarez.

32:45.431 --> 32:49.299
Gabriel Alvarez mounted
a citizen's blockade.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.234
My copper mine in Huaron,

32:51.236 --> 32:54.137
a very effective

32:54.139 --> 32:57.207
and very expensive blockade.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.508
Her shift is over.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.010
That waitress,
her shift is done at 5:00.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.545
Copy that.

33:01.547 --> 33:02.713
Quadrant Three,

33:02.715 --> 33:04.081
possible subject,

33:04.083 --> 33:05.182
waitress, black hair.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.217
DAVID:
I was approached.

33:07.219 --> 33:11.621
I was told if you cut the head,

33:11.623 --> 33:14.725
the body falls.

33:14.727 --> 33:18.662
I said "Yes,

33:18.664 --> 33:20.564
"take care of him."

33:20.566 --> 33:24.601
Two days later,
the blockade was gone,

33:24.603 --> 33:27.671
and I didn't ask any questions.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.341
I am

33:31.343 --> 33:34.544
responsible for the death

33:34.546 --> 33:37.447
of Gabriel Alvarez.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.787
I said "Yes."

33:47.126 --> 33:49.092
Yes

33:49.094 --> 33:52.029
is the easiest word.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.398
Yes,

33:54.400 --> 33:56.500
I love you.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.667
Yes,

33:57.669 --> 34:00.303
I will marry you.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.441
Yes,

34:04.443 --> 34:06.643
get rid of the problem.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.612
What you don't know

34:08.614 --> 34:12.115
is that saying yes

34:12.117 --> 34:14.317
stays with you forever.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.654
The violence you do.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.057
These choices.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.658
Quadrant Three,

34:21.660 --> 34:24.294
male black suit
approaching possible subject.

34:24.296 --> 34:25.695
DAVID:
I am sorry.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.265
I am...

34:29.768 --> 34:32.169
so sorry.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.804
(gasping):
No, no, no!

34:33.806 --> 34:35.072
Sam, tell me
you got the solution.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.307
I've got it.

34:37.776 --> 34:38.809
Go, go, go, go.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.811
<i> Asesino!</i>

34:40.813 --> 34:41.745
(gasping)

34:49.421 --> 34:50.654
Now?

34:50.656 --> 34:52.189
Dead.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.757
Definitely dead.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.459
Okay, can we keep
cell signals blocked

34:55.461 --> 34:56.693
until we get
this thing is off?

34:56.695 --> 34:58.195
Done.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.663
Mezzanine clear?
Mezzanine clear.

34:59.665 --> 35:03.266
Jules, up in the mezzanine,
Spike's gonna meet you up there.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.601
Copy that.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.305
Whoa, whoa.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.873
I don't think so.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.810
Okay, it's time.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.879
Okay.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.349
Okay...

35:19.651 --> 35:21.818
Okay.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.625
All right?
Yep.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.759
You're going to take
this thing off?

35:29.761 --> 35:31.161
That's right.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.196
Where's your gear?
It's all right here.

35:33.198 --> 35:34.397
No, I mean don't you have

35:34.399 --> 35:35.465
a protective suit
or something?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.600
No, I don't need one.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.868
Please.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.836
We're going to
be just fine.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.406
Okay.
Okay.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.683
Boss, we got the journalist.

35:53.685 --> 35:54.851
He tried to exit
the staff door.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.920
One of the uniforms
recognized him.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.728
I should have told her.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.764
I'm not here to judge.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.800
I was trying to protect her.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.769
So were we.

36:52.911 --> 36:53.910
Thank you.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.412
You're welcome.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.514
Thank you.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.958
Thank you.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.959
Thank you so much.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.360
Okay.
Thank you.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.861
Excuse me,
Mrs. Graham?

37:11.863 --> 37:13.230
Yes.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.665
Go ahead.
State your name and address.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.969
My name is Claudia Andres.

37:18.971 --> 37:21.905
I live at 267 Cressy Road,

37:21.907 --> 37:24.007
in North York.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.243
I am a waitress
in this hotel.

37:26.245 --> 37:29.846
I'm really sorry
about what happened tonight.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.816
Mrs. Graham, can you
identify this woman?

37:32.818 --> 37:35.352
Her face, her voice?

37:37.956 --> 37:39.022
Yes.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.391
Yes, I can.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.427
She served us lunch today.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.669
Okay, thank you.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.537
Wordy, let's bring her
to the VIP guys.

37:54.539 --> 37:55.939
Get her processed as
a possible accessory.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.875
Copy that.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.883
Catherine, I'm sorry.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.052
I'm so sorry.
Don't you...
don't you apologize!

38:10.956 --> 38:14.024
(sobbing)

38:16.795 --> 38:20.030
Sir, they're going to need
a few minutes to debrief.

38:20.032 --> 38:23.066
Right, of course.

38:23.935 --> 38:24.901
I got to go.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.603
Okay.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.539
Thank you.
Yeah.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.449
Thank you.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.356
8:27 P.M.: incident contained.

38:46.358 --> 38:49.059
Two arrests. VIP secured.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.762
That was a long day.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.930
If it's okay with you,

38:53.932 --> 38:56.433
all right, debrief tomorrow.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.934
Yeah.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.069
Sam, Spike...

38:59.071 --> 39:02.005
good job, everybody.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.773
Good job.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.676
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.012
Date night.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.046
All right.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.848
See you tomorrow.
All right.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.785
Yeah, I know.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.120
So, why are you leaving?
We got the truck.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.521
I'll take you back.

39:51.522 --> 39:52.921
Can you just
take it back to HQ?

39:52.924 --> 39:54.858
I'm really close to my house.
I just want to walk.

39:54.860 --> 39:55.859
Fine, I'll drive you home.

What?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.578
Okay, stop, all right?

39:58.579 --> 40:00.095
I don't need you to be nice
to me right now.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.865
I don't need you to rescue me
or be the big hero.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.032
I just...

40:03.034 --> 40:06.503
I need a minute alone.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.139
You think I feel
sorry for you?

40:09.141 --> 40:11.741
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard. Let's go.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.144
Jules, I'm driving you home.

40:14.146 --> 40:15.712
I promise you don't
