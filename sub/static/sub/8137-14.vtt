00:24.124 --> 00:25.955
KITT!
Michael, help!

00:30.930 --> 00:33.899
This one's on me.
The next one is on me.

00:33.967 --> 00:37.368
I shall have to recommend he
be reclassified for light duty.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.462
KITT is the world's greatest
automobile.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.507
KITT cannot be trusted
under pressure.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.503
What happened?

00:46.479 --> 00:47.468
Let's do it!

01:04.897 --> 01:06.263
Knight Rider...

01:06.332 --> 01:09.961
a shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

01:10.303 --> 01:12.066
who does not exist.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.978
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.048 --> 01:24.642
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.717 --> 01:26.708
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.786 --> 01:30.017
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.938
Michael, Devon is calling.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.513
Hello, Michael.
Hello, yourself.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.281
If you'd waited a couple more
minutes, we could talk face to face.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.788
We're almost
back to the semi now.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.221
That's why I'm calling.
I'm afraid I won't be there.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.452
I injured my back.

04:20.526 --> 04:24.622
And I don't want any cracks about
falling off barstools, chasing blondes...

04:24.697 --> 04:27.495
slipping on banana peels,
or anything like that.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.297
Somehow, that image
didn't occur to me.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.934
Bonnie will be doing
double duty, taking my place.

04:34.073 --> 04:36.974
She'll fill you in on what
we've got. What's the case?

04:37.043 --> 04:38.943
"Acid" John Byrock.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.243
You can pat yourself on the back
for putting the Foundation onto him.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.341
I'll pat myself on the back
when we put him out of business.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.114
It took considerable research
and surveillance...

04:48.187 --> 04:50.781
but I now think we have a
handle on just how to do that.

04:50.857 --> 04:51.949
Good luck, Michael.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.390
Let's go, buddy.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.776
I think you're gonna like
the movie selection...

05:15.848 --> 05:17.008
we have for today.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.516
So Devon told me.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.246
Please, tell me you caught
Acid John in the act.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.415
No such luck. But we have put
a lot of pieces together.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.723
The waste disposal site
itself...

05:29.796 --> 05:32.390
where acid is so powerful that
it can eat through steel...

05:32.465 --> 05:34.399
and is presumably
contained...

05:34.467 --> 05:37.334
but it's actually leaching
into local ground waters.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.767
There are barrels
of toxic waste...

05:39.839 --> 05:42.535
rusted, leaking.
A nightmare.

05:44.944 --> 05:49.244
There's our man, John Byrock,
otherwise known as Acid John.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.379
Owner of
Interstate Waste Disposal.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.046
King of the polluters.
Your friend and mine.

05:55.221 --> 05:59.555
Yeah. Very famous for dumping
chemicals that kill, in your backyard...

05:59.892 --> 06:01.723
or in lakes and streams.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.458
He likes his manicures today,
but he came up from the streets...

06:06.632 --> 06:09.897
and there's still plenty of
dirt left on those fingernails.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.829
Bonnie, tell me you've found
a way to nail this guy.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.930
We concentrated
on finding his records.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.306
They'd show a jury what chemicals
came into the disposal sites...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.972
and what chemicals
were left unaccounted for.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.605
You mean dumped.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.276
We've been all through that.
The D.A. subpoenaed his records.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.478
And then Byrock was happy
to give them a set.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.954
A nice, clean phony set
from his nice, clean offices.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.086
Here. Here's what Devon
brought you in for.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.790
For obvious reasons, Byrock stays as
far away from the dumpsites as he can.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.766
But we were able to catch him
there on two separate occasions...

06:41.834 --> 06:44.234
and both times
carrying a briefcase.

06:44.303 --> 06:46.567
You think the real records
are in the dumpsite.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.368
We think
they're in that office.

06:48.441 --> 06:52.036
And the D.A. says, if we can
confirm, he'll put him away.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.739
Terrific. Now I'm gonna do
some investigating of my own.

07:20.406 --> 07:24.035
I think we just entered enemy
territory. Can you give me a reading?

07:25.578 --> 07:28.604
The road surface is covered
with benzene and PCBs...

07:28.681 --> 07:31.047
polyvinyl chloride, C-56...

07:31.117 --> 07:33.813
all in all,
a highly toxic combination.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.958
You need a hand?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.853
Who are you?
I was just passing by.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.964
You might as well just keep on
going. There's nothing you can do.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.263
There's nothing anyone can do.

08:25.638 --> 08:26.935
You sure?

08:28.307 --> 08:31.299
On second thought, why not?
He's too heavy for me.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.368
You think you can pick him up
and put him in my van?

08:33.446 --> 08:35.607
I'll take him to the vet,
for all the good it'll do.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.114
Yeah, come on.

08:41.220 --> 08:44.053
You know, I get the feeling
you know what's happening here.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.317
Is this your ranch?

08:45.391 --> 08:48.383
I'm not a rancher.
I'm a wildlife photographer.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.122
See all these dead cattle?

08:50.196 --> 08:53.324
The illegal dumping of toxic
waste is on its way in...

08:53.399 --> 08:55.026
the wildlife
is on its way out.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.830
There you go, little guy.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.863
Okay. All right.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.833
You know, everybody knows
what's going on here...

09:05.912 --> 09:09.109
but no one wants to do anything
about it. They just keep passing by.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.172
Well, not everybody.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.180
Look, I'm sorry.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.086
Thanks for your help.
My pleasure.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.057
Take care.
Yeah.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.987
Thanks a lot.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.733
You get the feeling
they don't want company?

10:05.805 --> 10:08.239
More to the point,
who'd want to visit?

10:08.608 --> 10:11.509
Yeah, right. See if you can
find the office.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.846
That's it.
Upper left quadrant.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.346
What kind of security?

10:17.416 --> 10:19.748
There's a Bell model
211-403 safe...

10:19.819 --> 10:22.811
and a Marco steel and rock
fireproof file cabinet...

10:22.888 --> 10:25.186
complete with
combination lock.

10:25.324 --> 10:28.293
Looks like we've got our work
cut out for us.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.072
All right, I'm going in, KITT.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.335
KITT, I need some help
with this lock.

11:57.750 --> 11:58.910
Thank you.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.264
I think we hit
the mother lode.

12:15.634 --> 12:19.502
Activate photo-scan, will you?
Take a couple pictures of this.

12:24.343 --> 12:27.574
Hey, you! Hey!
What are you doing in here?

12:27.646 --> 12:30.740
Hey, come here you little kitty! What
did you do? How'd you get in here?

12:30.816 --> 12:32.750
Let me go!
Give me that camera!

12:33.018 --> 12:34.349
Let me go!

12:37.356 --> 12:39.620
KITT, we've got problems.
Get in here.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.755
Right away, Michael.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.058
How'd you get in here?
Let me go!

12:51.804 --> 12:53.897
Hey, you guys, get out here!

13:03.949 --> 13:05.678
Going somewhere, fellows?

13:26.739 --> 13:27.967
Michael!

13:33.179 --> 13:34.840
KITT! Come on!

13:38.384 --> 13:39.783
Michael, help me!

13:43.789 --> 13:45.416
Michael, help me!

13:49.895 --> 13:51.522
Michael, help me!

13:52.131 --> 13:53.257
KITT!

13:53.465 --> 13:55.899
Michael.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.766
I can't, buddy. I can't.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.066
Michael...

14:01.140 --> 14:04.405
Call Byrock. We got a break
in. And set those dogs loose!

14:05.010 --> 14:07.570
They're coming.
We've got to get going.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.674
I'll be back.
Michael...

14:09.748 --> 14:11.545
I'll be back.
Come on.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.710
Come on.
I'll be back.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.814
Help.

15:58.757 --> 15:59.883
KITT?

16:12.404 --> 16:15.703
Let's get him out of here.
The sooner the better.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.777
Mr. Byrock, there's no reason
you have to...

16:32.157 --> 16:34.648
You know me?
You have a beef against me?

16:34.727 --> 16:37.696
The same beef the whole world
has. Now what do you mean by that?

16:37.763 --> 16:40.596
Mr. Byrock, there's no reason you
even have to talk to this person.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.894
All right.

16:41.967 --> 16:45.698
Look, I don't know you, I don't
know what you want, and I don't care.

16:45.771 --> 16:48.797
But I'll tell you what,
don't come back here.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.406
You know
what a restraining order is?

16:51.944 --> 16:54.742
You hear what I'm telling
you? No, I'm reading your lips.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.838
Step one more foot
on this piece of property...

16:56.915 --> 17:01.079
and I promise you, you will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.178
You got that?
You take your hands off me...

17:03.255 --> 17:05.382
or you're gonna end up
exactly where that car was.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.117
Now, have you got that?

17:07.593 --> 17:09.492
Don't press your luck.

17:09.928 --> 17:12.226
You're walking
out of here this time.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.522
This one's on me.
The next one is on me.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.970
Michael, let's get KITT
out of here, please.

17:52.504 --> 17:53.994
How bad is it?

17:55.808 --> 17:58.743
He's gone, Michael.
Destroyed.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.471
Everything, but his frame,
his shell...

18:04.183 --> 18:06.708
How long will it take
to repair him?

18:10.689 --> 18:11.951
I don't think
you understand.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.753
It's not a question
of repairing him...

18:13.826 --> 18:15.691
it's a question
of recreating him.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.696
There are only the barest
shreds of his memory bank left.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.823
But he can be recreated.

18:20.899 --> 18:25.063
With a lot of help, and a lot
of work and time, yes, but...

18:25.671 --> 18:27.002
But what?

18:27.072 --> 18:30.599
But KITT was greater than
the sum of his parts, Michael.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.310
We can recreate the parts.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.937
But whether they'll ever become
KITT again, I just can't say.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.311
We'll do it. Whatever
it takes, we'll do it.

18:37.382 --> 18:40.510
Now you said you need some
help. What kind of help? Who?

18:40.686 --> 18:43.211
Von Vorman...

18:43.288 --> 18:44.277
Breland, and Yamata.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.582
Where are they?

18:45.657 --> 18:47.488
Von Vorman's living in Berne,
Switzerland.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.027
I don't know
where Yamata and Breland are.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.527
Devon.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.298
Michael, I've been waiting
to hear. How is he?

18:59.371 --> 19:01.601
Not good. Look, we need
the original team.

19:01.673 --> 19:04.107
I don't care what you have
to do, or where they are...

19:04.176 --> 19:06.235
but we need them
and we need them fast.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.739
Michael, there's nothing you can do here.
Why don't you go get a cup of coffee?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.242
Michael?

19:57.930 --> 19:59.727
Okay, Bob. Let's go.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.766
Testing, one, two,
three, testing.

20:43.141 --> 20:44.802
Excuse me, please.

20:45.210 --> 20:48.008
Dr. Von Vorman, Dr. Yamata,
I'm so glad you're here.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.570
We came as quickly
as we could.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.412
Let me fill you in on some of
the things we've done already.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.683
Up five points, please.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.838
Bob, this is Dr. Breland. I'd like
you to help him out any way you can.

21:46.905 --> 21:49.396
Maybe start with showing him
your end of the problem.

22:01.119 --> 22:02.848
How's it coming?

22:02.921 --> 22:06.015
It's coming. How, we
won't know for a while yet.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.291
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

22:13.732 --> 22:17.327
Well, if there isn't anything
I can do... There isn't.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.335
To be honest, I could
use an hour or two. Good.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.533
I was looking for a polite way
to kick you out of here.

22:24.543 --> 22:27.103
You know, Bonnie, it's funny.
What?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.440
Sometimes it takes
something like this...

22:29.514 --> 22:32.711
to make you realize how much
you take people for granted.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.946
I'd forgotten how good
you really are.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.388
Thank you.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.400
Thanks for coming.
I know it's late.

22:53.805 --> 22:57.172
Did you bring the photos?
Yeah, they're right here.

23:02.647 --> 23:03.705
Wow.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.746
All of these were taken
at Byrock's dumpsite?

23:06.818 --> 23:09.343
Yeah. More to add
to my collection.

23:09.421 --> 23:11.753
Some of them are kind of good,
some not so good.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.814
None of them are good enough
to make the cover...

23:13.892 --> 23:15.223
of a national magazine,
though.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.591
Have people stand up
and take notice.

23:18.063 --> 23:21.328
I've got a dozen portfolios
filled with shots like these.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.892
You know, it seems to me you've
made Byrock a personal crusade.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.335
Any reason why?

23:27.105 --> 23:31.166
I came home the summer after my first
year as a professional in New York...

23:31.643 --> 23:34.441
I went to the lake where we
used to go hiking and fishing.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.743
I hadn't been there for years.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.045
I couldn't believe the change.

23:39.451 --> 23:43.512
The trees were either dead or dying,
there were no fish in the lake...

23:43.922 --> 23:47.756
Don't tell me, let me guess. Byrock
had a waste disposal site nearby.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.185
Yeah.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.922
So I extended my vacation.

23:54.466 --> 23:55.831
I made phone calls.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.064
I contacted every city
and state official I could.

23:59.137 --> 24:00.764
And then finally,
18 months later...

24:00.839 --> 24:03.535
the Department of Health
issued a search warrant.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.633
But the night before they
were to exercise it...

24:05.710 --> 24:07.940
the place just happened
to burn down.

24:08.146 --> 24:11.013
Arson. I didn't know for sure. Not then.

24:11.082 --> 24:13.141
But in the two years I've been
following him...

24:13.218 --> 24:14.845
I've seen it happen
three times.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.445
You fight the local
bureaucracy, the red tape...

24:17.522 --> 24:19.353
you're in a position
to move on him...

24:19.424 --> 24:21.722
and then suddenly
a mysterious man shows up...

24:21.793 --> 24:24.853
and there's a fire that night
that destroys everything.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.763
I think I've got an idea
how to nail this guy.

24:31.837 --> 24:35.000
It'll take 18 months.
No, it won't. Not if it works.

24:35.073 --> 24:37.541
Look, you have no idea
how involved due process is...

24:37.609 --> 24:39.543
when it comes to toxic
waste. Yeah, I do.

24:39.611 --> 24:43.047
I just want to leave it to the people
with more time and more patience.

24:43.114 --> 24:45.674
I want you to tell me everything
you know about Byrock...

24:45.750 --> 24:48.617
whether you think it's
important or not, I want to know.

25:04.769 --> 25:07.636
Hey, pal, it's me, Michael.

25:10.609 --> 25:11.837
Hello, Michael.

25:11.910 --> 25:15.368
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Ready for a couple of 180s?

25:15.447 --> 25:18.541
Maybe a couple 90s, a little
crash through a wall, huh?

25:20.552 --> 25:22.543
I was just kidding here.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.382
KITT?

25:25.757 --> 25:28.851
I guess my humor mode
needs a little more work.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.094
Where's Bonnie?
Did Bonnie leave?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.130
No. She's right outside.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.531
As a matter of fact,
she says you are doing great.

25:36.601 --> 25:39.764
You're gonna be as good as new
in no time at all.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.400
KITT?

25:44.342 --> 25:45.434
Yes?

25:46.444 --> 25:50.107
Did you hear what I
just said? Yes, Michael.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.684
Well, I...

25:55.720 --> 25:58.746
I just wanted to come in here
and see you how you're doing, pal.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.347
There's a lot of people
out there...

26:00.425 --> 26:03.553
who are really anxious to get
back in here and finish you.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.688
So, I'll see you later, huh?

26:08.266 --> 26:11.201
Goodbye, Michael.
Bye, buddy.

26:31.022 --> 26:32.148
Well?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.427
It's not him.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.594
What do you mean it's not him?
Of course it's him. It's KITT.

26:39.664 --> 26:43.794
Is, but it isn't. I don't
know, Bonnie, something's wrong.

26:44.269 --> 26:48.000
Well, of course there's something
wrong. You saw what happened to him.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.836
I don't know
what you expect of me...

26:49.908 --> 26:51.341
Bonnie,
I'm not criticizing you...

26:51.409 --> 26:53.843
it's just that KITT... KITT
has not been finished yet.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.710
He needs more work. I don't
know what you expect from him.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.544
Jokes and pratfalls?

27:03.822 --> 27:07.724
You are gonna love it.
Forty-eight feet, twin diesels...

27:07.792 --> 27:09.692
it has what they call
a "fly bridge."

27:09.761 --> 27:12.252
That's where my captain sits
when he's driving the boat.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.389
While we're down below
partying.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.559
We will leave
Friday afternoon about noon.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.937
And, why don't you bring along
that cute girlfriend for Eddie?

27:20.005 --> 27:22.906
You mean Melissa? The one
that does the bikini ads?

27:23.375 --> 27:26.469
Yeah. On second thought,
we'll leave Eddie home.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.212
Hey, Byrock!

27:31.583 --> 27:34.313
What do you want? I'm gonna
talk and you're gonna listen.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.217
Look, I warned you...
Yeah, you warned me...

27:36.287 --> 27:38.448
but I'm gonna keep coming
down on you real hard, man...

27:38.523 --> 27:40.457
until I see you out
of business for good.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.516
Don't let the limo
and the suit fool you.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.256
I know how to deal with you. I
just don't have to deal with you.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.195
You got no evidence.
Oh, really?

27:47.265 --> 27:48.994
A little trip
to your acid pit...

27:49.067 --> 27:51.194
was a lot more productive
than you thought.

27:51.269 --> 27:53.237
Oh, really?
Then where's the law?

27:53.304 --> 27:55.272
The law's
a two-edged sword, man!

27:55.340 --> 27:57.808
You've been sitting pretty
on one side for a long time.

27:57.876 --> 28:01.039
Now you're gonna feel the
other side. The side that cuts.

28:10.055 --> 28:12.785
All right, I did exactly what
I told you I was gonna do.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.985
I rattled his chain real good.
Now let's see if you were right.

28:16.061 --> 28:19.827
He's going to do it, like he's done it
every time someone's gotten close before.

28:19.898 --> 28:22.264
He's gonna burn that toxic
waste site to the ground...

28:22.333 --> 28:23.994
and then go find
a new place to poison.

28:24.069 --> 28:28.438
Fran, I wouldn't ask you to tail him,
but he's gonna be looking for me now.

28:28.506 --> 28:30.303
I'll be the eyes and ears
for both of us.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.172
Both of us? The man
hasn't got a chance.

28:33.378 --> 28:37.371
It may take a while. But I don't have any
idea when he's gonna make his next move.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.007
I've been waiting years.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.711
How's KITT doing?

28:41.653 --> 28:42.950
They're still working on him.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.700
Response time is better, yes? Yes.

29:07.045 --> 29:11.641
KITT, what's the square root of
256, and the capital of Montana?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.808
Bonnie, really...

29:13.918 --> 29:16.079
KITT, do you know the answer?

29:16.154 --> 29:18.349
Can Michael Jackson moonwalk?

29:18.923 --> 29:23.360
Sixteen and Helena,
population 22,730.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.521
The city boasts some lovely
old mansions along Power Street.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.123
Police chief Bill Ware
keeps the streets safe.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.668
And it's not as cold up there
as they say it is.

29:31.736 --> 29:33.499
Shall I go on?
You got it.

29:33.571 --> 29:35.903
Did I hear what I think
I heard?

29:36.307 --> 29:37.604
What do you say, pal?

29:37.675 --> 29:39.700
Michael, I'm so glad
to see you.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.110
I have new diodes
and circuit boards...

29:42.180 --> 29:44.045
Whoa! Don't wear yourself out.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.810
He sounds great.
How's he doing?

29:45.884 --> 29:48.876
Well, we're still not sure, but
you can see there's improvement.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.649
Improvement?
That's an understatement.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.556
We're planning a test run on the
track in a few minutes, Michael.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.561
Can you be there? I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

30:02.767 --> 30:03.927
Ta da!

30:50.615 --> 30:53.083
He looks pretty good.
Not really.

30:53.751 --> 30:56.584
He should be going
through this course at 100.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.986
He's not doing
more than 60 now.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.150
Just warming up?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.289
The suspension's too stiff,
maybe.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.694
No, that's not it.
Look at him.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.412
I was afraid of that.
What?

31:24.482 --> 31:25.779
He's been hurt.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.910
It's not surprising that he
doesn't want to be hurt again.

31:29.187 --> 31:33.248
You mean he's lost his nerve?
In layman's terms, yes.

31:34.325 --> 31:37.886
Well, maybe if I reformat the
software... Miss Barstow, I'm sorry.

31:38.663 --> 31:42.394
I shall have to recommend he
be reclassified for light duty.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.865
Light duty?

31:43.968 --> 31:45.936
Utility vehicle, perhaps.

31:46.504 --> 31:49.564
A recreational use. It's
still a very fine automobile.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.838
Very fine automobile? KITT is
the world's greatest automobile.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.277
What do you want to do?
Turn him into a golf cart?

31:55.346 --> 31:56.745
Look at him.

31:59.984 --> 32:04.114
He's trying to play the brave
soldier, for you I suspect.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.190
But he cannot be trusted
under pressure.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.852
He just doesn't have it
anymore.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.393
He'll never admit it,
but you watch.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.024
He'll find some excuse
to stay out of the action.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.905
A little rusty,
but not bad, eh, Michael?

32:22.974 --> 32:26.307
Yeah. You looked
great out there, pal.

32:27.912 --> 32:31.040
You ready for business? Just as
soon as you can get me out of here.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.913
I have been poked,
prodded, and violated.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.350
Oh, my!

32:38.589 --> 32:39.715
Fire!

32:58.343 --> 33:00.868
Maybe they should tow me back to... No.

33:00.945 --> 33:03.277
No one
is going to tow you anywhere.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.784
We are going back to Bay 3 and
we are going to get you in shape.

33:06.851 --> 33:08.751
And then we are going
to come out here...

33:08.820 --> 33:11.755
and we are going to run this
test until you get it perfect.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.381
Now, have you
got that straight?

33:13.458 --> 33:15.551
Mr. Knight, with all
due respect...

33:15.626 --> 33:18.493
I appreciate everything
you've done, Dr. Von Vorman...

33:18.563 --> 33:20.861
but the ball's in my court
now.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.962
You with me, Bonnie?

33:25.103 --> 33:26.365
You bet.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.254
Gotcha!

34:50.321 --> 34:53.779
All right! And now,
the final touch.

35:41.672 --> 35:42.764
Yes!

35:49.313 --> 35:50.780
Way to go, partner.

35:50.948 --> 35:53.542
Very good. Very, very good!

35:53.651 --> 35:55.744
Nice to have you back
at the controls, Michael.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.153
Yeah! It's nice
to be here, partner.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.350
It's very nice to be here.

36:07.532 --> 36:08.965
We are back!

36:31.255 --> 36:32.381
Perfect!

36:51.909 --> 36:53.934
Just one more test.

36:54.111 --> 36:56.978
Michael, that's 14 inches
of reinforced concrete!

36:57.048 --> 37:00.279
No sweat, pal. We've
penetrated twice that much.

37:07.425 --> 37:08.722
What happened?

37:08.793 --> 37:11.956
Michael, at this stage
of my recovery... KITT...

37:12.263 --> 37:15.824
we could have gone through
that thing like shaving cream.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.492
Trust me, will you?

37:17.568 --> 37:19.502
I do trust you, but...

37:21.138 --> 37:24.073
I'm sorry, Michael.
It's okay, pal.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.735
Sorry.

37:26.043 --> 37:27.943
What happened?
Why didn't you finish?

37:28.012 --> 37:29.775
Michael, we got him!

37:32.650 --> 37:34.880
Terrific! That's him.
Who?

37:34.952 --> 37:38.388
Mike Zoormagian, the most
infamous arsonist in the country.

37:38.456 --> 37:40.981
That's him meeting with
Byrock today. It worked.

37:41.058 --> 37:43.049
What worked? Byrock's
gonna blow the dumpsite...

37:43.127 --> 37:44.560
and we're gonna
catch him doing it.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.187
Get ready for the ride
of your life.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.255
Michael, you can't take him.
Oh, yes I can.

37:48.332 --> 37:50.562
What if he gives out on you
just when you need him most?

37:50.635 --> 37:53.365
Or what if he tries to work
for you and tries too hard?

37:53.437 --> 37:55.428
Michael, I'm not sure
I'm ready.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.937
KITT, we're partners, aren't we? Yes.

37:58.476 --> 38:00.876
And you trust me, don't you?
Yes.

38:01.178 --> 38:03.840
Then believe me
when I tell you, we're ready.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.415
Wish me luck!

38:36.747 --> 38:39.215
I was hoping I'd never
see this place again, Michael.

38:39.283 --> 38:40.978
I know how you feel.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.044
If things work out,
this'll be the last time.

38:52.763 --> 38:54.162
Here we go.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.768
That tanker full or empty?

39:04.442 --> 39:05.568
Full to the brim.

39:05.643 --> 39:08.703
Michael its contents are identical
to those awful chemicals in the pit.

39:08.779 --> 39:11.373
All right, get me Bonnie.
I'm here with Fran, Michael.

39:11.449 --> 39:12.746
Bonnie, it's going down.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.910
There's a fully loaded tanker
headed out right now.

39:14.985 --> 39:17.249
I'll relay the information
to the state police.

39:17.321 --> 39:18.845
They're ready to set up
a roadblock.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.357
All right, tell them to hustle
up. You know where to find me.

39:21.425 --> 39:24.053
That's what worries me. You
two take care of yourselves.

39:24.128 --> 39:27.859
Michael, I just detected tumblers
opening the security locks in that office.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.197
It's all falling into place,
KITT. Byrock is cleaning house.

39:31.268 --> 39:33.702
He's covering his tracks
with his usual M.O.

39:33.771 --> 39:36.934
All the evidence will go up in
flames when Zoormagian does his bit.

39:37.007 --> 39:38.872
Al!
Yeah, boss.

39:40.444 --> 39:43.675
Get everybody out of here. You got 15
minutes, then this place is going up.

39:43.748 --> 39:44.942
You got it.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.346
That's got to be Zoormagian.

39:50.755 --> 39:52.985
Yes, sir, right on cue.

40:04.935 --> 40:08.462
Well, isn't that a pretty
picture. Partners in crime.

40:08.539 --> 40:11.406
What do you say we
photograph it for posterity?

40:11.475 --> 40:13.170
Not to mention the D.A.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.441
Careful with that stuff,
or we'll both be history.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.377
You hire an expert,
and then you lose faith.

40:21.819 --> 40:23.684
I've got a 1.30 flight.

40:23.821 --> 40:26.722
I don't want anything to
happen until after I'm gone.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.919
Video and audio?
I remember the plan, Michael.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.825
I had a feeling you would.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.658
Too bad.
It was a gold mine.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.033
There'll be others.
You burn it good.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.568
It'll be
like it was never here.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.504
Two minutes. I've got
to clear out the safe.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.475
Byrock just talked himself
right into jail.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.303
You ready?

40:49.380 --> 40:51.439
What exactly
are we going to do, Michael?

40:51.515 --> 40:53.676
KITT, you were just bragging
about your memory.

40:53.751 --> 40:58.154
Michael, if you're suggesting I'm afraid,
nothing could be further from the truth.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.522
I don't experience fear.

41:00.591 --> 41:04.083
I do, however, abide
by my dominant program...

41:04.395 --> 41:08.161
the preservation of human life. I
mean, you could be hurt down there.

41:08.899 --> 41:10.127
KITT...

41:11.035 --> 41:12.662
before we met...

41:13.571 --> 41:15.562
when I was still
Michael Long...

41:17.308 --> 41:20.744
What am I telling you this for,
huh? You already know what happened.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.676
But maybe you don't know
all of it.

41:23.747 --> 41:27.979
When I regained consciousness
a couple days later...

41:28.252 --> 41:31.949
I could still see
that muzzle flash in my face.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.180
I couldn't get it
out of my mind.

41:34.258 --> 41:38.627
For months after that, every
time somebody lit a match...

41:39.497 --> 41:42.830
or car headlights went by
in my face, I'd flinch.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.770
How did you overcome
it, Michael? I didn't.

41:48.472 --> 41:50.235
It overcame itself.

41:50.574 --> 41:53.566
All I did was refuse
to give in to it...

41:53.644 --> 41:56.078
and do what I knew
had to be done.

41:59.950 --> 42:04.284
Speaking of what has to be done, I
believe we have an arsonist to stop.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.116
Gotcha.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.585
You ready? Yes, Michael,
I am. And Michael...

42:11.862 --> 42:13.762
thanks.
Piece of cake.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.031
Silent mode.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.407
Nicely done, Michael.
Thanks, pal.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.778
We're not finished yet.
We got to find Byrock.

43:09.453 --> 43:10.818
Michael...

43:19.129 --> 43:20.994
We could micro-lock
his brakes.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.622
That wouldn't prove much,
would it?

43:22.700 --> 43:24.292
No, it wouldn't, partner.

43:24.368 --> 43:27.929
It's you and me, pal.
It's you and me. Let's do it!

43:49.493 --> 43:52.587
Welcome back, buddy!
Welcome back.

43:52.663 --> 43:54.995
I must admit, this is
a good feeling, Michael.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.099
Let's do it, KITT.
Let's end it.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.040
Decoy him to the pit.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.387
All right, let's end it
right here.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.428
Come on.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.286
Payback time.

45:28.992 --> 45:30.425
What a shame.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.724
Get me out of here!

45:37.968 --> 45:39.333
Over here!

45:42.272 --> 45:43.796
That's perfect.

45:44.475 --> 45:46.340
What are you two doing here?

45:47.244 --> 45:50.509
We're getting the cover for
Newswatch magazine, what else?

45:52.382 --> 45:55.613
Come on. What is this? Get
me out of here. What is this?

45:55.686 --> 45:58.780
I believe it's called
"hazardous waste disposal."

45:58.856 --> 46:02.189
Wouldn't you agree, partner?
I most certainly would.

46:18.876 --> 46:20.503
Sorry about the rain.

46:20.577 --> 46:24.445
Well, a picnic's a picnic,
and this way there's no ants.

46:25.149 --> 46:27.049
Very, very good point.

46:28.852 --> 46:31.320
Bet you're real proud of
that photograph, aren't you?

46:34.158 --> 46:36.991
Yeah, it's been
a long time coming.

46:37.427 --> 46:41.227
Well, I'm glad we're the ones
who made sure he finally got...

46:41.398 --> 46:42.558
wasted.

46:44.368 --> 46:48.270
Yes, well, unless my speed reading
program has developed a glitch...

46:48.338 --> 46:52.104
I can't find anything in the
accompanying article that indicates...

46:52.176 --> 46:55.168
who put those Neanderthals
into that acid pit.

46:55.512 --> 46:57.002
Why, KITT...

46:57.147 --> 47:01.140
I seem to detect a subtle craving
for recognition in that statement.

47:01.218 --> 47:02.776
After
what I've been through...

47:02.853 --> 47:06.516
a little publicity might help
reinforce my self-image.

47:06.723 --> 47:08.657
Well, gee,
I'm real sorry, buddy.

47:08.725 --> 47:11.523
I thought you were one of
those old-type heroes, you know?

47:11.595 --> 47:14.120
The kind who just
drove off into the sunset...

47:14.198 --> 47:15.495
secure in the knowledge...

47:15.566 --> 47:18.160
that you could handle any
situation that might arise.

47:18.235 --> 47:21.261
I don't know if those
old-time heroes were so much.

47:21.338 --> 47:25.240
I mean, they always drank
sarsaparilla and never kissed the girl.

47:25.576 --> 47:28.340
What was all that about?
Michael?

47:29.780 --> 47:31.042
Michael?

47:33.917 --> 47:34.906
Michael.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.115
Michael.
