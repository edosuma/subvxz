47:42.302 --> 47:45.004
[Crickets chirping]

47:45.105 --> 47:47.507
[Water running]

47:47.607 --> 47:49.343
[Water stops]

47:56.650 --> 48:00.254
I think Mariel and Friedrich
are fighting.

48:00.354 --> 48:03.623
Barely said a word to her
all night.

48:07.093 --> 48:08.862
That was some toast you gave.

48:08.962 --> 48:10.797
Yeah, I was feeling nostalgic.

48:10.897 --> 48:13.367
I could see that.

48:14.534 --> 48:17.771
You ever like to look back,
Clare?

48:18.905 --> 48:20.740
You like to...

48:20.840 --> 48:22.709
reflect on your life?

48:22.809 --> 48:24.010
Your family?

48:24.110 --> 48:25.945
You're drunk.

48:26.045 --> 48:27.147
But you're...

48:27.247 --> 48:29.115
always very composed.

48:29.216 --> 48:30.384
Aren't you?

48:30.484 --> 48:32.118
[Sighs]

48:32.219 --> 48:34.188
I go to all this trouble,

48:34.288 --> 48:36.290
slave away to throw you
the perfect night...

48:36.390 --> 48:38.792
Perfect night in a perfect life.

48:42.296 --> 48:45.232
You know everything about her,
don't you?

48:46.266 --> 48:50.003
You know every little detail.

48:50.103 --> 48:53.039
Or has it been you,

48:53.139 --> 48:55.775
just playing me this whole time?

48:55.875 --> 48:57.811
[Scoffs]

48:58.878 --> 49:00.780
Tell me...

49:00.880 --> 49:02.816
Clare.

49:03.950 --> 49:06.653
Where did she end

49:06.753 --> 49:09.689
and you begin?

49:09.789 --> 49:11.891
Hmm?

49:11.991 --> 49:14.761
Did I ever even fuck
my real wife?

49:14.861 --> 49:16.095
You want to fuck me?

49:16.196 --> 49:18.232
I said "my wife"!

49:18.332 --> 49:20.734
[Yelps, grunts]

49:20.834 --> 49:23.503
[Baby crying in distance]

49:29.343 --> 49:31.177
This your way out, Clare?

49:31.278 --> 49:33.046
Hmm? You ever get caught,

49:33.146 --> 49:34.514
one little swallow,
it all goes away?

49:34.614 --> 49:37.016
- Fuck you!
- Take it, you fucking spy!

49:37.116 --> 49:39.219
I'm giving you a way out.
Take it!

49:39.319 --> 49:41.655
[Crying continues in distance]

49:43.390 --> 49:46.159
It won't do anything, Peter.

49:46.260 --> 49:48.595
I let it go bad.

49:49.729 --> 49:52.499
It expired.

49:54.434 --> 49:56.336
Don't you understand?

49:56.436 --> 49:58.372
[sniffles]
All my life,

49:58.472 --> 50:01.841
I never had anything of my own.

50:03.009 --> 50:05.545
But things are different now.

50:07.847 --> 50:09.516
How?

50:09.616 --> 50:11.685
[Crying continues in distance]

50:15.289 --> 50:17.691
[Fussing]

50:22.762 --> 50:25.164
[Fussing stops]

50:25.265 --> 50:27.834
NURSE: Just give her a minute.

50:27.934 --> 50:30.404
[Fussing softly]

50:32.205 --> 50:34.173
[Chuckles softly]

50:34.274 --> 50:36.209
How'd she know how to...

50:36.310 --> 50:39.713
'Cause, dear, she's yours.

50:42.282 --> 50:44.684
What will you call her?

50:44.784 --> 50:46.386
For the register.

50:50.824 --> 50:52.892
Spencer.

50:57.431 --> 51:00.467
Call her Spencer.

51:01.305 --> 51:07.406
