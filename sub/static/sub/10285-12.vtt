00:04.105 --> 00:05.606
Previously on ER:

00:05.639 --> 00:08.309
How would you feel
about an Ortho rotation?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.678
You have a surgical elective
requirement, so now...

00:10.711 --> 00:12.113
you're all mine.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.714
I'm Jaspreet,
Neela's cousin.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.483
My pleasure.
Uh, wait.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.350
Excuse me.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.618
Wait. But...

00:17.651 --> 00:19.687
I'm your friend.
Are you really about

00:19.720 --> 00:21.655
to lecture me on love
with your track record?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.291
Don't....
Because I'm
thinking right now

00:23.324 --> 00:25.426
Ray is really wishing
he didn't meet you.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.095
I need to go somewhere.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.397
A facility with
professionals.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.634
So take Joe,
go to Croatia for your father,

00:33.667 --> 00:35.603
while I do that.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.259 --> 01:00.661
MAN:
Your full reinstatement,
Dr. Lockhart, is yet

01:00.694 --> 01:02.663
to be determined.

01:02.696 --> 01:06.167
You'll be allowed to work
shifts on a probationary status

01:06.200 --> 01:07.835
until several contingencies
are met.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.203
LOCKHART:
Okay.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.804
WOMAN:
A minimum of two

01:10.838 --> 01:12.773
two weekly physician
diversion group meetings,

01:12.806 --> 01:14.675
plus at least three
AA meetings a week.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.743
LOCKHART:
Okay. Understood.

01:15.776 --> 01:19.447
(construction roaring)

01:19.480 --> 01:21.349
MAN:
Under normal circumstances

01:21.382 --> 01:22.750
this committee would
require you to attend another

01:22.783 --> 01:24.452
30 meetings in 30 days

01:24.485 --> 01:26.320
before allowing you
back on the schedule

01:26.354 --> 01:30.658
in addition to the 30
you've already attended.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.326
but, because you
were so forthcoming

01:32.360 --> 01:33.761
and volunteered
to check yourself

01:33.794 --> 01:35.896
into a domestic

01:35.929 --> 01:38.599
detox facility, we've decided
to make an exception.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.235
Dr. Pratt also asked us
to make some concessions

01:41.269 --> 01:43.171
on your behalf.

01:43.171 --> 01:47.208
So, effective immediately, you
are cleared to return to work.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.743
Oh.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.245
Uh... thank you.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.313
Thank you,

01:52.346 --> 01:55.183
but I need a little more time.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.851
Um... My husband,
Dr. Kovac, and our son

01:57.885 --> 01:58.886
are in Croatia.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.454
They've been there...

02:00.488 --> 02:02.823
I, I just need to spend
some time with them,

02:02.856 --> 02:06.494
and I think I would be better
for it when I come back to work.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.332
We have no problem with that.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.700
Dr. Pratt?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.202
It's fine by me.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.703
I can always adjust
the schedule.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.271
How much time
do you think you need?

02:17.305 --> 02:19.240
A couple of weeks, maybe.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.210
Since we won't be able
to monitor you in Europe,

02:22.210 --> 02:24.812
you understand, we'll have to
ask you to start all over again

02:24.845 --> 02:25.813
when you return.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.849
60 meetings. 60 days.

02:28.882 --> 02:29.850
Diversion group.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.819
Random urine tests.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.955
Absolutely. Agreed.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.324
Thank you.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.933
Jaspreet, I gotta pee.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.936
Jaspreet!

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
I heard you got in late
last night.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.777
(shower running)

02:56.810 --> 02:58.279
Where'd you end up going?

03:03.351 --> 03:04.818
Where'd you end up going?!

03:10.358 --> 03:13.361
Some club called The Passage.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.962
DJ was wicked.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.697
What are you doing?

03:16.730 --> 03:17.965
I have to pay

03:17.998 --> 03:19.300
for hot water, you know.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.292
Okay. No pronator drift.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.695
Mrs. Smalls.
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.298
Oh, another cute doctor.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.732
Must be my lucky day.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.702
She's been having
trouble sleeping.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.670
No past medical history.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.506
Exam was normal.
I haven't had

03:58.539 --> 04:00.341
a good night in weeks.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.943
Have you had any belly
or chest pains?

04:02.976 --> 04:05.313
This is all Marty's fault.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.747
He's my husband.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.750
Mmm.
He's the one
that keeps waking me up.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.853
I hear him calling me
in the middle of the night.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.955
So, I don't quite follow.
He, he wakes you up

04:14.988 --> 04:16.390
while you're sleeping?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.925
Yes, every night.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.594
Have you considered
telling him to stop?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.363
Waking you up.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.899
It doesn't help.
Then I just dream about him.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.935
Well, is he here?
Maybe we can talk to him.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.704
He's been dead
for six years.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.608
Now, you don't worry,
Mrs. Smalls.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.943
We're gonna take
good care of you,

04:35.976 --> 04:38.746
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.482
Psych consult?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.684
Yeah. Check the CBC,
chem panel, and UA

04:43.717 --> 04:46.820
in case she has
hypercalcemia, okay?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.489
And, uh, call Julie Dupree.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.824
The chaplain?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.426
She's pretty hot
for a chaplain.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.694
She's pretty hot, period.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.862
How's that working out?

04:56.564 --> 04:57.898
I'm gonna go
order these labs.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.367
Sam, you seen any attendings?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.369
(vomiting)

05:01.402 --> 05:03.036
My God.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.438
Please make it stop.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.673
What the hell
happened to you?

05:05.706 --> 05:06.574
Bad baba ganoush.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.841
Oh...

05:07.875 --> 05:10.378
I need you to sign off
on our CHF'r,

05:10.411 --> 05:11.845
and the board's getting
pretty full.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.481
And I need one, too.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.050
Why don't you go home?

05:17.084 --> 05:19.052
You look like ass.
Thank you.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.055
I was home until Skye
got sick with the flu.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.691
Morris, are you sick?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.526
No, Frank, I got this IV

05:25.559 --> 05:26.860
because I'm feeling
a little parched.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.596
I can't get sick. I got
a date this weekend.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.963
It's food poisoning.
You can't catch that.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.732
(speaking Spanish)

05:31.765 --> 05:32.933
Loco me dice se todo.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.602
Gates, GYN has a bed,

05:34.635 --> 05:36.704
but they can't take
your PID for two hours.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.472
That's what they said
four hours ago.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.007
Don't get uppity.
I just work here, honey.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.109
Sam, what's with my
chemo lady in 4?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.011
Still waiting for Oncology.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.979
Are we the only department
working today?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.515
I need a coffee.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.717
Uh... Dr. Pratt and Abby
need some privacy

05:49.750 --> 05:50.618
for a few minutes.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.819
Abby's back?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.521
I thought she
was in Croatia.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.656
Well, what are they doing
in there? What's so private?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.658
Well, I suppose if they
had wanted you to know,

05:57.691 --> 05:58.826
they would have
invited you.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.161
And where am I gonna
get my coffee?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.563
Jumbo Mart. In fact,

06:02.596 --> 06:04.465
you should get
us all one.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.734
Ooh, yeah. I'll
take a large latte.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.869
Mm. Black. Regular.
Hold the cream.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.704
Gimme a hot tea, will ya?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.105
FRANK:
Large, no foam

06:12.139 --> 06:13.541
percent latte Americana.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.875
What the hell is that, Frank?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.544
Just tell Bheru to fix
Frank's regular.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.712
I don't drink coffee.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.780
All right, if anyone needs me,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.715
I'll be at the Jumbo Mart.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.551
Freeloaders.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.453
(door bangs)

06:25.486 --> 06:27.788
Somebody help!

06:27.821 --> 06:29.590
Hold on. What happened?
What happened?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.124
I heard some guy
beating on her.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.526
I-I broke in.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.761
I fought him off.
All right.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.995
All right. I need a gurney here!

06:35.028 --> 06:36.464
What's her name?
Sally.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.832
Sally. Okay, Sally.
Can you hear me?

06:38.866 --> 06:40.601
He hurt her bad this time.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.570
I-I think
her arm is broken.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.605
ABBY:
Okay.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.540
What are people saying?

06:46.574 --> 06:49.910
Well, they think you've been
in Croatia since Christmas.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.612
That's it?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.749
I was sure the rumor train
would be running.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.884
Thank you.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.151
Well, you know
how it is.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.687
One minute
it's Thanksgiving.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.955
Then all of a sudden
it's next year.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.857
People do their own thing.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.495
Mmm.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.163
Listen, thank you very much
for your discretion

07:10.197 --> 07:11.965
and, um...

07:11.999 --> 07:15.503
and I'm sorry I had to
burden you with this stuff.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.505
It's not a burden, Abby.
It's management.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.573
You know, the only reason
I know the whole story

07:19.607 --> 07:22.009
is because I'm your supervisor.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.711
I gotta say it.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.515
I thought we
were friends.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.617
Of course we're friends, Greg.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.655
Then why wouldn't you
come to me for help?

07:34.688 --> 07:37.858
You know, it didn't
have to go like this.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.660
Well, it turns out...

07:39.693 --> 07:41.995
I'm not so great
at asking for help.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.531
(laughs)

07:45.232 --> 07:46.667
Well.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.701
Well, I'm here.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.170
Okay?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.705
You do know that, right?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.010
(sighs)

07:57.044 --> 07:59.279
Chuny and the nurses
sent a condolence card
for Luka's dad

07:59.312 --> 08:01.549
and I told them I'd call
when I got back

08:01.582 --> 08:02.683
and I just... I hate this.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.018
(sighs)

08:05.052 --> 08:08.221
I'm so embarrassed
and ashamed.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.024
Oh, you shouldn't be.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.693
Really?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.795
I was a bad friend.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.030
I was a bad doctor.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.699
I was a bad wife.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.634
I was a bad mother...

08:20.668 --> 08:22.035
No.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.938
We see bad mothers come
through here all the time,

08:24.972 --> 08:26.907
and you do not qualify.

08:28.609 --> 08:32.078
We all have flaws, Abby,
but how many of us actually

08:32.111 --> 08:33.581
work to fix it?

08:33.614 --> 08:34.914
(knocking)

08:36.183 --> 08:37.751
Sorry to interrupt.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.820
Victims from a building fire
are en route.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.855
All right, go ahead
and prep the trauma rooms.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.823
I'll be right there.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.058
(sighs)

08:45.092 --> 08:46.259
Damn.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.728
It's a terrible day
for multiples.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.729
(groans)

08:48.762 --> 08:49.730
What's up?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.965
We're short-staffed.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.034
Hey, I could work
for a couple of hours.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.069
Really. I'm cool.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.238
My flight's not till tomorrow.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.807
Might even feel good.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.074
Wow.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.210
Your cousin, Neela,
is truly gifted.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.078
Do I look taller?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.747
I-I feel taller.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.849
Yeah. My advice
is cut and run.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.183
Are you insane?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.085
Cut and run? I'm putting
this on my blog.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.821
Oh, God, that's just wrong.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.056
If that's wrong,
I don't want to be right.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.058
Uh-oh. The surgeons are here.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.327
Hey, what's up, party people?!
Hi, guys.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.095
Hey, Neela, how's Jaspreet
doing? She hasn't called me

09:22.129 --> 09:23.997
in a few days.
Oh, Jaspreet?

09:24.031 --> 09:25.198
She's doing just
fine, buddy.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.266
Trust me.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.637
Somebody call
for a doctor?

09:29.637 --> 09:30.638
Hey, you.
Welcome back.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.639
How was Croatia?

09:31.639 --> 09:33.006
Uh, you know. European.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.207
Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.142
Harms, what it look like?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.810
Dexter Jackson, 11,

09:36.844 --> 09:39.913
apartment building fire,
burns to hands and chest.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.181
Crush injuries from
falling debris.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.282
Tachy to 160. BP: 100.
All right, Dex.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.951
Don't worry: we're gonna

09:43.984 --> 09:45.886
get you fixed up.
Morris, take him to Trauma 1.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.154
Grady, you go with him.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.957
What we got here?
Kayla Weeks, seven.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.392
Smoke inhalation, minor
injuries, some wheezing.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.861
Sat's 92.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.395
Having trouble
breathing, sweetie?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.798
Firefighter behind us
is pretty bad.
Okay.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.167
Abby, get her set up on nebs
and check a baseline chest.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.835
Chuny, come with me.
Yup!

10:01.869 --> 10:03.170
Zades, talk to me.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.172
Jay Gleason, 28.
Floor gave way in a fire.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.206
15-foot fall.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.274
Burns to hands and face.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.341
Possible spine injury.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.877
Jake, where you hurting at, man?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.244
Back mostly.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.279
Sat's 91.
All right.
Come on.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.014
Let's get him in Trauma 2.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.283
Hey, do me a favor. Wiggle
those toes for me, all right?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.818
Like that?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.090
I'm sorry. I know
it's last-minute,

10:23.123 --> 10:24.191
but they surprised me.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.726
Well, that was
nice, right?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.728
Yes, I guess, from a
certain point of view

10:27.761 --> 10:29.262
one's big brother
and his wife

10:29.296 --> 10:31.164
showing up unannounced
is nice, yes.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.733
Not nice?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.101
No. Yes. It's very nice.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.936
It's just that...

10:35.969 --> 10:38.739
usually by dessert they're
telling me how worried they are

10:38.772 --> 10:42.209
because, you know, I'm wasting
my life away as a chaplain.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.077
Well, if the shoe fits...

10:44.111 --> 10:46.213
Kidding. What,
are they not religious?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.281
Hardcore Catholic.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.083
And he's a hedge
fund millionaire,

10:50.117 --> 10:52.686
so it doesn't help that I'm
a $35,000-a-year chaplain.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.887
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:53.921 --> 10:54.988
Are you scared
to meet my family?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.223
Who, me?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.091
No, I would love
to meet your family.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.092
It's just that, uh...

10:59.126 --> 11:00.360
You know, I just don't know

11:00.393 --> 11:03.096
what time I'm gonna
be done here, and..

11:03.130 --> 11:04.431
Well, if you can,

11:04.464 --> 11:06.099
I could really
use some backup.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.835
All right. I'll...
I'll let you know.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.303
How's she doing?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.205
Out cold.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.107
Sally?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.109
Sally?

11:16.143 --> 11:17.377
(moaning weakly)

11:17.410 --> 11:19.747
Oh, got a little ETOH
going here, huh?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.081
Yeah, don't light a match.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.952
And, uh, it's not just alcohol.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.787
All right, we still
need a head scan.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.388
Did the plain films
come in yet?

11:28.421 --> 11:31.291
Uh-huh. And the CT will be ready
for her in a few minutes.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.359
And I already paged Ortho.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.794
Okay.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.828
She gonna be okay?

11:34.862 --> 11:37.030
I think so.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.366
They always fighting
over there, man.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.001
The guy, the guy--
he's a real prick.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.837
It's a good thing
you were close.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.905
C-spine's clear.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.007
How's her arm?

11:47.040 --> 11:52.312
Well, it's, uh... it's broken
pretty bad, but it's fixable.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.847
(Sally moans quietly)

11:53.881 --> 11:55.348
Can you get the
finger traps ready

11:55.382 --> 11:56.383
when they take her to CT?

11:56.416 --> 11:57.851
Should I wait here?

11:57.885 --> 12:00.120
That's fine.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.354
Oh, your head's bleeding.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.124
Hey, don't worry about it.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.059
Well, we should
look at it.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.297
It's okay. We won't bite.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.078
All right,
let me take a look.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.914
Want to sit down here?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.415
That doesn't look too bad.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.818
We could fix that up
with a couple staples here.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.385
Sam...

12:34.421 --> 12:36.356
Car accident.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.993
Head-on with
a drunk driver.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.429
I used to be a grade
school music teacher.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.966
Now I do courses online.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.435
Kind of hard
to scare the students
that way, isn't it?

12:56.509 --> 12:57.577
Wait, wait.
This is Ortho.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.012
Yeah. I start today.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.547
Oh, no, I thought
that was next week.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.115
Dubenko hates me!

13:02.149 --> 13:03.951
Well, Dubenko's not on.
Crenshaw is.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.319
Yeah, great.
He hates me more.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.022
Neela...

13:09.890 --> 13:11.358
(screams)
Ooh!

13:11.391 --> 13:13.093
(mocking groans,
laughter)

13:13.126 --> 13:14.527
Just a bit outside. Ow.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.429
Look at you.
You're early.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.899
Well, you know,
first impressions.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.200
Dr. Rasgotra, I'd like you
to meet Drs. Ramsey...

13:20.233 --> 13:21.434
Hey.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.936
...Craig...
How's it going?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.371
...and Pavlich.
Hey, what's up?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.239
RAMSEY:
Heard great things
about you.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.875
What's that?

13:27.875 --> 13:32.279
Oh, uh, this is Dr. Zelinsky,
surgical intern.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.381
You okay, man? You need a glass
of water or something?

13:34.414 --> 13:35.415
You look a little dry.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.516
No, I'm good.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.386
Yeah, Harold
was just leaving.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.587
Good luck.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.325
Hockey-- I used to play
a little at school.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.159
Field, not ice.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.427
Take a shot.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.062
Oh, I couldn't.
It's been years.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.230
Come on. Take a shot.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.970
Yes!

13:57.004 --> 13:58.438
Girl power! Come on!

13:58.471 --> 14:01.141
Aah!
Yes!

14:01.174 --> 14:03.410
First albuterol is done.
You want continuous?

14:03.443 --> 14:07.380
Uh, no, sats are up to 97
and the wheezing's better.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.916
Repeat treatment
in half an hour.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.550
Is that your brother
in there?

14:10.583 --> 14:14.421
No, he's not my real brother,
but he's nice to me so far.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.023
Are you guys foster kids?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.024
Yeah.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.125
Okay, well, you sit tight.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.259
I'm going to go check on him.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.493
My name is Abby.
This is Malik.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.195
Let us know if
you need anything.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.166
GRADY:
BP's up a little to 85.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.434
How's he doing?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.069
MORRIS:
Not great.
Still taching away.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.603
Blood in the belly?

14:30.637 --> 14:32.372
No free blood, but
look at the liver.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.574
LOCKHART:
Subscapular hematoma.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.543
Films are back.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.644
How's Luka holding up?

14:37.677 --> 14:40.180
Um... you know,
it's hard.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.082
My dad died
when I was 19.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.550
Well, at least you're back
in the States.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.653
Always nice to come home
after a long trip, huh?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.288
C-spine looks clear.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.290
Uh, nothing on the
chest or pelvis.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.491
FRANK:
Kid's foster mom is here.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.160
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.295
We were in the laundry room
when the fire broke out.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.663
Are they okay?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.665
Um, uh, Kayla has
some smoke inhalation,

14:58.698 --> 15:00.033
but she's gonna be fine.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.501
Dexter's a little more serious.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.303
He's got some bleeding
around his liver.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.038
It's probably
Stupid's fault.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.007
You leave
the oven on again?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.608
Keisha, I told you,
stop calling her that.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.477
Y'all got a phone
I could use, please?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.579
I need to get somebody
to cover my shift.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.081
Right there.
Dial 9 first.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.715
Pratt could use
a hand in here.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.350
I'll go.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.287
Solumedrol,
2.4 grams over 15 minutes,

15:20.320 --> 15:22.990
then infuse at
430 milligrams per hour.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.224
Somebody page Neurosurge.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.058
Can you get
a central line going?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.126
Yeah.
Good.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.327
MARQUEZ:
Nice to have you back.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.528
We missed you.
How's Luka?

15:28.561 --> 15:29.429
He's good.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.630
Sterile sixes, please.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.631
Neurosurgery's
on the way.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.266
Good.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.501
Well, if you're going
to have a funeral,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.736
Croatia's a good
place to do it.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.705
How is he?
Fracture at T-11.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.573
T-11.
What's that mean?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.010
Looks like we got
a fractured vertebra,

15:43.010 --> 15:45.445
with bruises of
the spinal cord.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.613
Will it get better?

15:46.646 --> 15:48.381
I'm not gonna be
paralyzed, am I?

15:48.415 --> 15:51.718
Uh, it's just a little too early
to tell right now.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.586
Those kids I saved--
are they okay?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.488
So far, so good.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.624
That little girl hadn't broken
that window and screamed,

15:57.657 --> 15:59.526
we would've never known
they were in there.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.727
(alarms blaring)
MORRIS:
Damn it!

16:00.760 --> 16:02.562
All right, go.
Just go, go.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.564
Okay, uh, prep and drape,
I'll be right back.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.632
All right.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.600
MORRIS:
Another 600 cc bolus!

16:07.634 --> 16:10.103
Hemoglobin's down
to 12.4. BP: 70.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.471
Type and cross
two more units.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.440
See what you did, Stupid?
Keisha...

16:13.473 --> 16:15.175
I didn't leave the oven on!
Liar.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.676
Okay, just stop! Stop!

16:16.709 --> 16:18.778
Dexter's gonna die
and it's all your fault!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.047
I hate you!

16:22.482 --> 16:24.151
Kayla, wait!

16:26.686 --> 16:28.521
Kayla...

16:28.555 --> 16:29.789
Ooh!

16:29.822 --> 16:32.559
Oh, my gosh...
are you okay, honey?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.494
Ow...
Come here, sweetie.
You okay?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.163
It's not my fault.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.766
I didn't leave the
oven on. I didn't.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.743
How many fingers
am I holding up?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.180
Um... three?

16:53.213 --> 16:54.714
Okay, what about here?

16:54.747 --> 16:57.084
No, sorry-- two.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.086
Can you follow my finger?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.558
Okay.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.165
How long have your eyes
been like that?

17:12.199 --> 17:15.135
I don't know. Forever.

17:15.167 --> 17:18.371
Yeah? You ever seen
a doctor for it?

17:18.405 --> 17:21.741
No. I keep it a secret
so people won't hate me.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.310
Sweetheart, nobody hates you.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.679
All my foster families do.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.581
That's why I
keep getting moved.

17:28.615 --> 17:32.252
Listen to me: grownups can
be really weird sometimes.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.587
And it may seem like
they don't like you,

17:34.621 --> 17:36.823
but that's probably just
because they're really...

17:36.856 --> 17:40.527
busy, or they're sad
or they're mad,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.462
but I guarantee you
it's not about you.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.763
You understand?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.133
And for what it's worth,
I like you.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.136
I left the oven on once,

17:49.136 --> 17:51.171
but I turned it off
all the way this time.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.573
I know I did.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.676
Ortho's here.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.411
GATES: Hey, Mayday.
RASGOTRA: Hey.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.447
Hey, since when
are you Ortho?
Since this morning.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.149
GROSSMAN:
You guys mind if
maybe we catch up later?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.784
I can see some films?

18:04.817 --> 18:06.353
TAGGART:
Here you go.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.521
Who are these guys?

18:08.555 --> 18:10.557
GATES:
Orthopedic specialists.
They're here to look at her arm.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.758
Okay, what ligaments
are disrupted

18:11.791 --> 18:13.393
in a perilunate dislocation?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.462
RASGOTRA:
The scapholunate and
the lunotriquetral

18:15.495 --> 18:17.530
interosseous ligament.
And?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.201
Back from X-ray?

18:21.234 --> 18:22.869
No, never went.
Sats are dropping.
Down to 91.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.471
All right, we'll have to
tube him before he goes to CT.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.373
Grady, you're up.
YOLANDA:
Is he okay?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.341
LOCKHART:
He might have some smoke damage
to his lungs.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.309
We're gonna help him breathe
for a little while.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.843
MORRIS:
Suction, please.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.180
Do you know anything about
Kayla's vision problems?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.314
Vision problems?!

18:34.347 --> 18:36.316
No.
Cricoid pressure.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.785
She's only been with me
for a couple of weeks.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.354
That explains a lot.
She's clumsy.

18:41.388 --> 18:41.921
MORRIS:
See the cords?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.390
Yep.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.525
Now, why would they send me
a disabled kid?

18:45.558 --> 18:48.561
They should know better than...
I can't handle that.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.464
I'm a single foster mom,
and I got five of 'em.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.632
I'm in.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.201
I don't think they knew.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.835
I think she's been keeping
this to herself.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.437
MARQUEZ: Sats are
coming up. 96.
But I'd like to run

18:57.470 --> 18:59.206
a few more tests, if
that's okay with you.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.507
Surgery's here.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.442
What do you need us
to fix this time?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.377
MORRIS:
25% body surface area burns.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.446
Crush injury with liver hematoma
on FAST scan.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.714
Pressure's down again.
What's happening?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.549
GRADY:
Following the Parkland formula?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.419
Four cc's per
kilo per...
Yes, thanks. We know.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.321
Hematoma could be expanding.
Let's take a quick look.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.956
I'll throw in a central line.
I want his BP up before CT!

19:16.989 --> 19:18.458
Intraosseous is faster.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.293
No, I can get more fluids
with a central line!

19:20.327 --> 19:21.694
(tool whirring)
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:25.465 --> 19:27.800
Oh, and I am in
before you even gloved up.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.469
CRENSHAW:
All right, let's get him up
to CT.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.939
LOCKHART:
Okay, squeeze in
another few liters.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.242
And you should go with them.
Let's just follow them.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.579
I hate surgeons.
It seems like
it's mutual.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.581
How you feeling?
Like hell.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.852
Morris, have you ever heard of
a genetic disorder called LCA?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.555
No, but it's just
food poisoning.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.823
Not you. Little girl
from the fire.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.426
Leber's congenital amaurosis.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.495
It causes center field
vision loss in kids.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.497
And she had a normal
fundoscopic exam,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.432
and nystagmus,
which are indicators.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.868
Well, I've never heard of it.
Send her to Ophtho.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.336
Let them sort it out.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.937
Can somebody please
give me a shot?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.005
I'm dying here.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.340
What is it,
compazine?

20:07.374 --> 20:09.576
Yeah, I been
puking my brains out.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.910
What are you doing?

20:10.943 --> 20:12.912
I'll do the arm.
No butts.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.514
Well, it hurts way more
in the arm.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.815
No. Here.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.418
Come on!
Be a professional!

20:18.451 --> 20:20.420
All right, Abby, make it quick.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.625
(groans)

20:25.658 --> 20:27.394
Right cheek or left?

20:29.028 --> 20:31.731
Okay, exaggerate the deformity
slightly...

20:31.764 --> 20:32.832
then pull.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.833
Ow!

20:33.866 --> 20:35.968
Not bad. Splint.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.505
You want a sugar tong extended
to the end of the phalanges?

20:38.538 --> 20:39.506
Thanks, hon.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.508
Or Sam.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.476
Post-reduction films
and get her on the surgery list.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.711
Stabilize the wrist.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.546
Think I can go home soon?

20:46.579 --> 20:49.382
Uh, no. You know what?
I want to get

20:49.416 --> 20:51.618
a tetanus shot
for that head lac first, okay?

20:51.651 --> 20:53.453
How long is that gonna take?
I should go.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.689
Just hang out. We'll take
care of you soon, okay?

20:56.723 --> 20:57.890
Wow. What happened
to that guy?

20:57.924 --> 20:58.891
Car accident.

20:58.925 --> 20:59.892
You did great.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.628
RASGOTRA:
I did?

21:01.661 --> 21:04.464
TAGGART:
Hey, stranger.
We heard you were back.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.765
Hi.
Hi.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.766
GATES:
What's up?

21:06.799 --> 21:07.900
Nothing. Hi.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.569
Hi.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.774
TAGGART:
How are you?
I'm good.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.543
GATES:
Yeah? You were gone
a long time.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.477
We didn't know
if you were coming back.
Yeah.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.978
Where were you?

21:19.011 --> 21:21.348
I was taking some private time
to... uh, personal time.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.649
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.050
Barry Grossman.
Orthopedics.
Hi.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.420
Abby Lockhart.
So you're up in Ortho.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.755
Uh, yeah.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.523
That's great.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.592
TAGGART:
How was Croatia?
I hear it's gorgeous.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.094
Yeah. Uh, well, yeah.
I'm going tomorrow.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.863
Oh, you mean you didn't go?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.565
No. Joe and Luka
are there.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.933
But I had some stuff I had
to take care of, so...

21:40.967 --> 21:42.835
Okay.

21:42.869 --> 21:47.574
Sorry to break up the little
reunion, but we gotta...

21:47.607 --> 21:48.107
Hey, I'm gonna call
you tonight, okay?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.642
Okay.

21:49.676 --> 21:53.045
I'm gonna go work
on that splint.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.514
GATES:
Cool. I'll meet
you there.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.515
Good to see you.
You, too.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.584
Welcome back.
Thanks.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.489
ROSEMARY:
Then the rabbi
says to the priest,

22:02.522 --> 22:05.725
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know
you were sitting here."

22:05.758 --> 22:07.527
(laughing)
That's hilarious!

22:07.560 --> 22:09.496
I've never heard
that one before.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.930
Hi. Looks like you
guys are having fun.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.099
She's delightful.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.101
Well, your labs
came back normal,
which is good,

22:15.134 --> 22:16.803
so there's gonna
be another doctor

22:16.836 --> 22:18.871
to come down here and
talk to you soon, okay?

22:18.905 --> 22:22.542
Take your time.
I got nowhere to be.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.677
You mind if I borrow
her for a second?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.646
(whispers):
Go ahead.
I'll be right back.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.148
Thanks for coming down.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.484
I thought maybe a little God
talk would do her good.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.985
Oh, she's actually
an atheist.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.555
But did you know she was
a Rockette back in the '50s?

22:35.588 --> 22:36.889
That's how she met
her husband.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.491
He came to the
show one night,

22:38.525 --> 22:40.493
and he hung out at the
stage entrance afterwards,

22:40.527 --> 22:41.794
just so he could
meet her.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.596
He said of the whole
line of beautiful girls,

22:43.630 --> 22:45.432
she was the only one
he saw.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.601
So... no prayers,
no meditation?

22:48.635 --> 22:50.069
Just shooting
the breeze?

22:50.102 --> 22:53.072
She's alone and grieving.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.107
And no matter
what you believe in,

22:55.141 --> 22:58.545
even if it's nothing, grief
is something I'm good with.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.815
Dinner is at Gibson's,
by the way,

23:02.849 --> 23:04.517
if that sweetens
the deal.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.652
Doesn't hurt.

23:05.685 --> 23:06.919
I'll see you later.
Okay.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.123
Hey, Frank, can you page
Psych for me again?

23:11.157 --> 23:12.625
What you do you mean,
she wasn't in Croatia?

23:12.659 --> 23:13.493
Luka and Joe went
without her.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.827
What was that all about?

23:14.861 --> 23:16.463
Yeah, where's she been
the past few weeks?

23:16.463 --> 23:17.664
Said she had some
personal stuff.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.031
Sounds like
divorce talk to me.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.166
No, you think? Really?

23:20.199 --> 23:21.468
I knew it
all along.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.669
Just a matter
of time.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.036
Guys...

23:26.606 --> 23:27.674
Everything okay?

23:27.707 --> 23:28.908
Yeah, it's all good.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.477
You bet.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.811
Ophtho returned
your call.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.546
Thanks, Frank.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.981
PRATT: Watch his IV.
HALEH: Trauma One's ready.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.015
HALEH:
It's flowing.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.056
PRATT:
Hang packed cells now!

23:44.090 --> 23:45.558
What happened?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.093
CRENSHAW:
Crashed before
we could scan him.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.227
What he mean, "crashed"?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.696
HALEH:
Rapid infuser's primed.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.631
LOCKHART:
Uh, he's bleeding internally.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.199
CRENSHAW:
He needs an ex-lap.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.867
He probably opened up
his hematoma.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.703
BP's 82/58.
We need more access.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.705
Hold on.
Maybe it's a pelvic fracture.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.707
You said you didn't see one.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.974
Yeah, but it's a tough call
in kids.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.576
And look, the symphysis
looks wide.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.877
There's a separation
and some SI diastasis.

24:04.911 --> 24:05.912
We don't have time
to argue

24:05.945 --> 24:07.880
about a questionable
finding.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.916
He could be crashing
because he's bleeding
in his pelvis.

24:09.949 --> 24:10.783
Liver's the most
likely source.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.251
You open his belly

24:12.284 --> 24:14.086
and it's a pelvic fracture,
he'll bleed out.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.187
So what, we just
screw around till
he exsanguinates?

24:15.221 --> 24:16.856
No, just keep looking.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.124
Show me free fluid.
You could do your ex-lap.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.926
T-pod him, infuse two units.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.128
We need to take
him up now.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.632
All right,
just give her two minutes.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.667
You know how this goes
if you're wrong?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.738
(alarm beeping)
This should tampen out
any pelvic bleeders.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.941
The liver hematoma's enlarging.
This kid needs the OR.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.042
No, it's not
that impressive.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.009
Abby, your two minutes
are up.

24:37.043 --> 24:37.944
How much blood has he had?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.579
That's 20 per kilo.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.947
Okay, let's get
this show on the road.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.650
(beeping stops)
Wait! Hold on!

24:43.683 --> 24:44.784
Pressure's good: 100/60.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.819
Hemoglobin's up to 14.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.255
You see any free fluid
in the belly?

24:49.288 --> 24:51.023
I suppose surgery
can wait a bit.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.559
What's going on?!

24:52.559 --> 24:53.693
We stopped the bleeding.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.564
Okay, stable.
Take him up to CT.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.668
GATES:
Hey, what are you
doing out here?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.235
What's the deal
with my tetanus shot?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.971
No one's come
for that yet?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.673
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
We're really slammed.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.575
You know what?
Why don't you go lay down

25:08.575 --> 25:10.577
on one of the beds?
You'll be more comfortable.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.613
She's been mumbling.

25:13.646 --> 25:17.016
I thought she
might wake up.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.919
I'm definitely not
the first thing
that she wants to see.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.721
GATES:
Oh, I'm guessing
she won't mind.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.091
You saved her life, man.

25:25.124 --> 25:28.828
One night...
I found her in the hall,

25:28.861 --> 25:30.830
passed out and drunk.

25:30.863 --> 25:35.067
So I went ahead
and I fished the keys
out of her purse.

25:35.101 --> 25:38.337
I couldn't just leave her there.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.973
But when I
brought her inside,

25:41.007 --> 25:44.711
she woke up and she freaked out.

25:44.744 --> 25:48.014
Yeah. Good times.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.951
I'll go check on your tetanus,
all right?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.953
Hang in there.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.693
Hey, man, listen very carefully,
all right?

26:00.727 --> 26:03.295
I don't care how backed up
you are. Just fix it.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.631
Thank you.
I'm glad somebody

26:04.631 --> 26:06.098
finally gave it
to Radiology.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.167
No, Frank, I was on the phone
with my landlord.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.936
My toilet's been running
for weeks now.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.971
Dr. Gates, the daughter
of your patient in 2

26:12.004 --> 26:13.139
returned your call.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.273
All right,
Psych come down

26:14.306 --> 26:16.042
for her yet?
Not that I know of.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.877
All right. Can you check
on my tetanus guy, please?

26:17.910 --> 26:20.179
Oh, for sure.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.154
Oh, my God, girl,
pinch me, I'm dreaming.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.355
Yes, gentlemen,
may I help you?

26:29.388 --> 26:30.256
We're looking for Dr. Pratt.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.290
Yeah, that's me.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.792
You guys must be

26:32.825 --> 26:34.293
here for Jake Gleason.
He all right?

26:34.326 --> 26:35.962
I think he's still in surgery,
but come on.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.063
I'll take you guys up.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.798
I can do that, Dr. Pratt.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.133
Yeah, thanks, Javier,
but I got this.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.168
Come on, fellas.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.003
(scoffs)

26:46.372 --> 26:48.274
We need to do
a test called

26:48.307 --> 26:50.910
an "electroretinogram,"
which tells us

26:50.943 --> 26:52.779
if the cells in the retina
respond to light.

26:52.812 --> 26:56.182
If it is this LCA thing,
what then?

26:56.215 --> 26:58.985
Well, we'll know what
we're dealing with, for one,

26:59.018 --> 27:00.920
and there are some
new therapies

27:00.953 --> 27:02.154
that could help.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.090
You just need
to sign here for consent.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.692
Okay.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.160
And they can actually
take her today if you want.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.764
Um, Dexter's up in surgery.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.932
Shouldn't I be up there?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.834
Okay. How about this?

27:14.867 --> 27:18.237
On the way up, we drop you off
at the OR and I go with Kayla

27:18.270 --> 27:20.740
for her test?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.174
You okay with that?

27:24.877 --> 27:27.847
Yeah, she can
come with me.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.318
God, where the hell's
the rest of my stuff?!

27:32.351 --> 27:33.085
Sally, get back in bed.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.887
Who are you?

27:34.921 --> 27:36.723
I'm Dr. Gates, and you have
a very serious fracture.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.324
Whatever.
You need surgery.

27:38.357 --> 27:42.028
Shut up! Will you just take this
off so I can go home?!

27:42.061 --> 27:43.763
Who stole my
other shoe, huh?!

27:43.796 --> 27:45.031
If you don't keep this
immobilized,

27:45.064 --> 27:46.198
it's not gonna heal right.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.234
Take if off!

27:48.267 --> 27:50.169
You want to sign out
against medical advice?

27:50.202 --> 27:52.238
Damn right.
I'm not letting you touch me.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.239
Fine by me.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.440
I'll get
the paperwork.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.242
You know what?
You walk out that door,

27:56.275 --> 27:57.977
you're gonna lose
the use of your hand.
You want that?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.079
What?

28:00.112 --> 28:02.815
Just get back in bed, okay,
and let us do our job.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.751
Do you even know
what happened to you?

28:04.751 --> 28:06.485
No.
Do you remember?
You got beat up.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.487
And your neighbor Eddie
intervened.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.856
You mean the freak?

28:09.889 --> 28:11.357
He should mind his own business.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.160
Oh, yeah?
Well, he saved your ass, okay?

28:14.193 --> 28:17.263
And he's got
a pretty nasty cut
on his head to prove it.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.199
How long's this gonna take,
anyway, huh?

28:20.232 --> 28:22.134
Does the posterior
technique have a name?

28:22.168 --> 28:23.169
The Kocher approach.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.270
And who was Kocher?

28:24.303 --> 28:26.338
A 19th century Swiss surgeon,

28:26.372 --> 28:28.775
perhaps the most famous
in his day.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.409
Published Kocher's Operative
Surgery 1892,

28:30.442 --> 28:33.079
Won the Nobel Prize for medicine

28:33.112 --> 28:34.480
in 1909.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.848
She Nobel-prized
you, bro.

28:35.882 --> 28:36.849
It's not funny.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.450
Oh, come on.
Give it up.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.787
She's money.
You're money.
Ignore him.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.855
Dude, give her some.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.056
I need some, too.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.792
Oh, no.
What?

28:45.792 --> 28:49.261
Wendy can't play next week.
Out-of-town baby shower.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.330
(sighs)

28:51.363 --> 28:53.032
What position did you play?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.867
Sorry?

28:54.901 --> 28:56.168
Field hockey? What position?

28:56.202 --> 28:58.304
Center forward.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.206
So we're all squared away
with your tetanus.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.307
We'll get you
signed out

29:01.340 --> 29:02.274
and you can split,
okay?

29:02.308 --> 29:03.442
Did she finally wake up?

29:03.475 --> 29:05.177
Yeah, just a little
bit ago.

29:05.211 --> 29:07.146
And her CT was clear,
so she's gonna be fine.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.817
She say anything
about what happened?

29:10.850 --> 29:14.220
No, but, um,
you know, she was...

29:14.253 --> 29:15.254
Dr. Gates.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.023
Not now, Grady, I'm busy.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.224
It's important.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.226
Like urgent
important.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.395
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.197
Stay.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.265
What?

29:26.298 --> 29:27.466
It's Mrs. Smalls in 2.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.035
Psych not come down yet?

29:29.068 --> 29:31.403
No, that's not really
a problem now.

29:31.437 --> 29:35.908
I found her pulseless
and apnic. She's got

29:35.942 --> 29:37.276
rigor mortis
and lividity.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.478
She must have died,
like, an hour ago.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.981
Didn't anyone come
and check on her?

29:42.014 --> 29:44.183
They were waiting
for Psych.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.057
You doing okay, kiddo?

29:51.090 --> 29:52.391
Yeah.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.326
You know, if it is LCA,

29:54.360 --> 29:55.862
might be worth
a write-up.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.164
We could co-author.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.465
That's okay. It's all you.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.299
Doesn't hurt at all.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.901
See? Told you.

30:01.934 --> 30:05.237
All right, now move
your forehead right up

30:05.271 --> 30:08.007
to the dome
and touch it.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.175
Good. Right there.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.615
It'll just take a minute
to calibrate.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.251
Hey, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.387
A doctor and a singer.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.322
Wow, both, huh?

30:23.355 --> 30:26.058
Well, I can't help you
with the singing.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.093
I'm really bad.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.227
I'm pretty good.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.196
Why don't you sing me a song?

30:31.263 --> 30:34.600
* I am beautiful

30:34.633 --> 30:38.404
* No matter what they say

30:38.437 --> 30:44.243
* Words can't bring me down

30:44.276 --> 30:50.016
* I am beautiful
in every single way *

30:50.049 --> 30:57.389
* Yes, words can't bring me
down, oh, no *

30:57.423 --> 31:01.360
* So don't you bring me down
today. *

31:05.064 --> 31:05.932
Gates, heard you killed
another happy customer today.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.199
That's nice, Frank, great.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.268
Uh, Psych just came down
to see her.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.003
Said they'd meet you in Sutures.

31:11.037 --> 31:14.340
Somebody's got a lot
of 'splaining to do!

31:14.373 --> 31:15.975
Pratt, can you sign off
on our GI bleeder?

31:16.008 --> 31:17.043
Yeah, and I need one
for my chemo lady.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.244
All right.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.479
Hey, how are you?
I'm good.

31:20.512 --> 31:24.616
Uh, I just wanted
to say if you need
to talk or anything,

31:24.650 --> 31:26.252
I'm totally here.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.454
I just want to make sure
that everything's okay.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.123
It's good.
I'm good. Thanks.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.659
JULIA:
The bone fragment was removed
from the spine.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.361
Surgery was successful.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.695
He's already started
moving his legs.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.097
It's all good.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.398
Thank you for everything,
Miss Dupree.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.299
My pleasure.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.201
You know what?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.403
I'll make sure the chapel stays
open for you guys all night.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.273
Oh, hey, excuse me.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.108
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
I worked on Jake.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.176
That's really
good news about him.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.410
Thank you, Doc.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.344
We appreciate everything
you people did.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.579
You're very welcome.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.481
Listen, do you
by any chance know

31:55.514 --> 31:57.483
how that fire
got started?

31:57.516 --> 32:01.453
Mrs. Rosemary Smalls.
What happened to her?

32:01.487 --> 32:02.989
We don't know.

32:03.022 --> 32:06.358
All righty, then.
Love the easy ones.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.426
Have a good night.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.233
Okay, great. Thanks.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.401
Good news.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.502
Dexter's surgery
went very well.

32:16.535 --> 32:17.503
He's in recovery
right now.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.271
Thank God.

32:19.305 --> 32:22.008
Emily can take you
up there as soon
as we're done here.

32:22.008 --> 32:26.278
So, there's no treatment
for this LAC thing?

32:26.312 --> 32:28.447
LCA.
Leber's congenital amaurosis.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.518
Sorry. This day's just...
it's been a lot.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.220
I know.

32:34.253 --> 32:37.189
Well, there may be
some gene-replacement therapies

32:37.223 --> 32:40.326
or clinical studies
we can enroll her in.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.630
You know, this
is manageable.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.232
There is hope.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.667
There's no reason
why she can't be

32:48.700 --> 32:51.137
a perfectly happy kid
with a full life.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.339
And you can do all
those tests right here?

32:53.372 --> 32:55.374
Well, no, there's an
organization in Iowa...

32:55.407 --> 32:58.444
Iowa?
Yeah, but we'd just
have to send them

32:58.477 --> 33:01.647
a tube of her blood,
and all the tests
are free of charge.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.316
Okay, baby girl,
let's go ahead and do this.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.185
Oh, and, um...

33:06.218 --> 33:09.588
I talked to the fireman,

33:09.621 --> 33:13.792
and he told me
there was an electrical
problem on the second floor

33:13.825 --> 33:15.161
that started
the fire

33:15.194 --> 33:17.563
so it had nothing
do with your oven.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.399
So... she didn't do it?

33:22.334 --> 33:25.304
You got something
to say?

33:26.472 --> 33:28.274
Keisha.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.076
(sighs)

33:30.076 --> 33:31.377
I'm sorry.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.813
But don't call me Stupid
anymore, okay?

33:34.846 --> 33:37.483
Don't worry, baby. She won't.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.087
Kayla...

33:42.488 --> 33:44.156
It was really great
to meet you.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.557
You take care, okay?

33:45.591 --> 33:47.326
Okay.

33:49.628 --> 33:53.432
How long will I have
to stay here, huh?

33:53.465 --> 33:56.135
Surgeons will answer
all your questions
when you get upstairs.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.104
What, a day, two days,
a week...?

33:58.137 --> 33:59.505
GATES:
We don't know, Sally.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.273
I got a life, you know?

34:01.307 --> 34:02.408
Could have fooled me.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.675
What did you say?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.777
You...

34:05.811 --> 34:08.380
Excuse me, Dr. Gates, how do I
get out of this place?

34:08.414 --> 34:09.481
This place is
like a maze.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.416
Just take those
doors back there.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.417
Hey, it's you.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.619
Hi.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.656
What, you can't look at me?

34:21.693 --> 34:23.329
Take off your hood.

34:37.376 --> 34:38.677
Oh, thank you...

34:38.710 --> 34:41.612
for what you did.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.415
You're welcome.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.155
Well, see you around.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.364
You can just go out
through those doors.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.831
Thank you.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.500
Take care, huh?

35:03.269 --> 35:04.336
Bye, Eddie.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.843
Poor guy.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.479
Yeah, it must be tough.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.516
Hey, Alex is in town.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.385
We're going to go
see a movie.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.787
If you and Sarah
want to come...
Can we go another time?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.255
I have this thing
I have to do.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.656
Yeah, anytime.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.657
Okay.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.693
Sure?
Mm-hmm.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.599
Go!
(shouting encouragement)

35:33.632 --> 35:36.502
Go! Go! Go! Go!

35:36.535 --> 35:38.637
Go! Go! Go!

35:38.670 --> 35:40.539
Go! Go!

35:45.844 --> 35:47.213
What are you doing here?

35:47.246 --> 35:49.281
I came to say good-bye.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.349
What's with the skates?

35:50.382 --> 35:51.283
Oh, long story.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.884
Where are you going?

35:52.918 --> 35:55.487
I'm going to go see Cousin Maya
in San Francisco.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.656
My father's apparently
coming to Chicago

35:57.689 --> 35:59.458
so I need to skip town
for the weekend.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.228
And what do you want
me to tell him?

36:02.261 --> 36:04.463
Tell him I've
completely disappeared

36:04.496 --> 36:06.532
and you have no idea
where I went.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.601
Okay, I'll call him.

36:09.635 --> 36:12.538
But I need you to do me
a really big favor.

36:12.571 --> 36:13.772
Rasgotra, practice
is Wednesday at 6:00.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.541
Game's Thursday at 7:00.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.643
We'll be at Ike's
if you want to join us.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.710
Hey, congratulations.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.347
Night.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.549
Congratulations?

36:23.582 --> 36:24.850
Did you win something?

36:24.883 --> 36:27.319
No, I think I just
got recruited.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.388
So what's this
big favor?

36:29.421 --> 36:30.956
All right, lastly,
starting tomorrow

36:30.989 --> 36:33.492
docs will not be permitted
to ask a nurse or clerk

36:33.525 --> 36:34.560
to call a consultant.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.961
It has to be a written order.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.429
More work for Frank.
Me, too.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.864
GATES:
Why do we have to do that?

36:38.897 --> 36:40.499
What if we're in the middle
of a trauma?

36:40.532 --> 36:41.800
Calm down.
It's just for a month.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.469
We have to present
real data to admin

36:43.502 --> 36:46.705
if we want to
eliminate delays.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.608
Unless anyone has
anything else to say,

36:49.641 --> 36:51.577
come on, let's
get back to work.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.878
Uh, hey, can I have a minute?

36:52.911 --> 36:53.845
With everybody?

36:59.818 --> 37:02.020
Um, I know some of you
have been wondering--

37:02.053 --> 37:03.555
and I appreciate the concern.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.024
I wasn't in Croatia

37:06.057 --> 37:08.360
for the last few weeks.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.629
After Luka's father died,
they left without me.

37:10.662 --> 37:15.301
And I was in a residential detox
facility.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.471
I'm an alcoholic.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.776
S...

37:24.810 --> 37:27.813
I just wanted to set the record
straight and tell the truth

37:27.846 --> 37:30.349
because I have way too much
respect for all of you

37:30.382 --> 37:31.550
to keep lying

37:31.583 --> 37:32.784
and I'm very,
very sorry

37:32.818 --> 37:34.320
because I know

37:34.353 --> 37:36.488
what I did
didn't only affect me.

37:36.522 --> 37:39.325
It affected all of you, too.

37:39.358 --> 37:43.362
And I just hope I haven't done
any irreparable damage

37:43.395 --> 37:45.397
to any of the relationships
here.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.698
But I'm sober now

37:46.732 --> 37:48.367
and I'm going
to stay that way.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.472
So you were in rehab
the whole time?

37:53.505 --> 37:55.574
Yeah.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.676
Were you ever drunk at work?

37:59.911 --> 38:00.979
Okay, come on, guys.
Let's get signed out

38:01.012 --> 38:02.548
get back out
on the floor.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.416
We still got a lot
of patients out there.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.817
Thanks.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.454
Wow, girl.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.821
Mmm.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.835
GATES:
I told her daughter
she was fine.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.904
I worked her up.
Everything seemed normal.

38:25.937 --> 38:28.607
Did you do everything
you were supposed to?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.576
Proper history, labs?

38:30.609 --> 38:33.078
I could have done an EKG,

38:33.111 --> 38:35.614
no, cardiac monitor.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.749
Maybe I missed an MI,
arrhythmia.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.018
Well, I'd be worried
about you

38:40.051 --> 38:42.120
if you weren't upset
about Mrs. Smalls,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.456
but I think
it's pretty obvious

38:44.490 --> 38:46.458
what the cause
of death was.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.693
She missed her husband

38:47.726 --> 38:49.695
and she wanted
to be with him.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.697
You're kidding me, right?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.032
No, I think she was
a pretty lucky lady.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.034
Julia, she died.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.404
She had a beautiful
daughter.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.706
She had a full life
filled with happiness

39:00.739 --> 39:03.041
and she found true love.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.544
Some people live their whole
lives and never get that.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.879
I mean, how else do you explain
her husband calling her

39:07.913 --> 39:09.615
from the other side?

39:09.648 --> 39:11.583
You really believe that?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.952
Yeah, I do.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.488
That's because I have faith.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.023
Faith?

39:18.056 --> 39:20.058
Yes.

39:20.091 --> 39:24.129
Look, we all end up
like Rosemary Smalls.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.564
Who knows when?

39:25.597 --> 39:26.865
Who knows how?

39:26.898 --> 39:29.701
But love, trust,

39:29.735 --> 39:32.638
truth, a higher power,

39:32.671 --> 39:34.139
the things
that really matter--

39:34.172 --> 39:36.442
you can't have any of those
without faith.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.577
Especially love.

39:40.679 --> 39:43.449
Now we are losing precious
pre-dinner drink time,

39:43.482 --> 39:44.683
and I need at least

39:44.716 --> 39:46.652
two martinis to deal
with my brother.

39:46.685 --> 39:47.986
So, come on.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.955
Come on, come on.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.091
Some meeting,

39:53.124 --> 39:54.125
huh?

39:54.159 --> 39:55.661
Yeah, some meeting.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.663
Let's admit to Med-Surg
for IV antibiotics.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.531
And where are her diverticula
most likely to be?

39:59.565 --> 40:00.932
The narrowest portion
of the colon

40:00.966 --> 40:02.033
with the highest
intrasegmental pressures

40:02.067 --> 40:03.635
is the sigmoid colon.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.504
Excellent work,
Harold.
All right, you,

40:05.537 --> 40:08.507
you, come here.

40:08.540 --> 40:12.511
All right, so, uh,
here's the deal.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.680
Jaspreet's gone
and she's not coming back.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.147
Where'd she go?

40:16.181 --> 40:18.149
Well, I could tell you that,

40:18.183 --> 40:20.652
but then I'd have to kill you.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.621
She asked me to relay
the following:

40:22.654 --> 40:25.624
"Archie, thank you
for a wonderful night.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.825
"It was great, but
please stop calling,

40:26.858 --> 40:28.226
and don't ever
call again.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.828
Ever." "Harold,

40:29.861 --> 40:31.530
"thank you
for a wonderful night.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.064
"It was great,
but please stop calling,

40:33.098 --> 40:35.100
and don't ever
call again. Ever."

40:35.133 --> 40:38.169
So, there you go.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.738
I'd very much appreciate it

40:39.771 --> 40:42.240
if we never speak of this again.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.675
Ever.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.780
You?

40:48.814 --> 40:50.482
You?

40:52.584 --> 40:53.585
Abby.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.120
Hi.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.922
Hey.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.624
How was your first day back?

40:58.657 --> 41:00.091
Good.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.593
How was Ortho?

41:01.627 --> 41:03.595
Great.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.597
I heard about
the staff meeting.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.933
Yeah, that was fun.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.802
It's good
you said all that.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.241
Listen, I owe you
an apology.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.709
No, you don't.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.711
I-I do.

41:19.745 --> 41:22.247
Because you tried to help me
and I just pushed you away,

41:22.280 --> 41:24.282
and you don't
deserve that.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.085
I'm still here
if you need help, you know.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.721
Thank you.

41:29.755 --> 41:30.822
(sighs)

41:30.856 --> 41:32.190
Gosh.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.859
You had me
so worried.
I know.

41:33.892 --> 41:34.993
I'm sorry.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.995
It's so great to have you back.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.664
Yep.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.998
Just in time
to leave again.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.567
When do you go?

41:41.600 --> 41:42.568
Tomorrow morning.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.835
I can't wait.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.637
I miss Joe and Luka
like crazy.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.138
Well, give them my best.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.574
Travel safe.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.141
Thanks.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.677
Okay.
All right.

41:51.710 --> 41:52.944
Bye.
Bye.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.648
See ya.
Bye.
