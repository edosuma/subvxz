that it's a little strange.
- "A little"?

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:45.393
- And we're hoping
to get to the bottom of this.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:48.430
- I mean, this is insane.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:51.633
- Would you like some coffee?
This could take a while.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:06.047
- Give it a rest, Mom.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.887
- <i>So until the arraignment,</i>

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.889
<i>they can't interrogate me</i>

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:16.124
unless I have
one of my attorneys present,

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.093
but there's no bail hearings
on the weekends,

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.095
so I'm stuck here.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.364
- It's ridiculous.

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:24.933
They asked me about everything
for hours.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.904
I thought I was losing my mind.
- You know, just take it easy.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.050
- Couldn't Bobby testify
that you were here at the house

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.041
that night?
We both could, couldn't we?

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:36.244
- It's not strong enough.
The time of death is long after

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:43.285
The most important thing is
I am innocent

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:48.490

but it's gonna take some time.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:52.227

it's connected to Lynn's case.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.930
- And what... what did Moran
think about that?

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.266

about something David said

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:30.258

It was about two years ago.

He came home really late
with this beautiful picture

And I was having

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:43.004

My old partner

- Who was released about
two weeks ago from a nuthouse.

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:08.683

Flay. If she just got out
of the nuthouse,

or in someone's custody.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.200
I had a totally different
picture of you in my head.

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:28.336

the best side of themselves
on social media.

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:33.775
Just pictures and text.

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:38.813

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.517
Wasn't I different

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:46.521
