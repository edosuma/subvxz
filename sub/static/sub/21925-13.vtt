00:11.511 --> 00:13.847
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery<i>:</i>

00:14.556 --> 00:16.891
<i>All hail Her Most Imperial Majesty...</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:18.727
<i>Mother of the Fatherland.</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:24.482
All hail the Emperor Philippa Georgiou
Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.651
All hail the emperor!

00:26.735 --> 00:31.239
You're a fugitive wanted for my murder.
You attempted a coup against the emperor.

00:32.741 --> 00:36.077
Listen to me. I need you. You need you.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.497
Your Georgiou is dead.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.625
-She's a ghost.
<i>Captain Michael Burnham.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:46.671
Captain Gabriel Lorca. That Stamets exploited the network
for his own gain. He corrupted it.

00:51.593 --> 00:56.514
There's no difference between his network
and our network. It's just one.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
That's why the damage is spreading.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.602
Everything everywhere
will be exterminated.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.564
There's a clearing in the forest.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.400
That's how they go.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.944
I'm sending coordinates
to the emperor's ship.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.197
<i>I would feel better</i>
<i>if Captain Lorca were the one</i>

01:12.280 --> 01:14.074
<i>making this request for a rendezvous.</i>

01:14.157 --> 01:16.201
-Trust me, so would I.
-<i>Acknowledged.</i>

01:16.284 --> 01:17.452
We'll see you soon.

01:17.535 --> 01:22.248
You're sensitive to light.
Lorca is sensitive to light, too.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.753
The Lorca I knew was my right hand.
I trusted him with you.

01:28.713 --> 01:33.218
My so-called captain's not from
my universe. He's from yours.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.359
<i>One year...</i>

03:14.694 --> 03:17.030
<i>and 212 days of torture.</i>

03:18.156 --> 03:19.657
<i>Of agony, my friends.</i>

03:21.159 --> 03:22.327
<i>My followers.</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:28.291
<i>But I have returned to give meaning</i>
<i>to your suffering.</i>

03:29.334 --> 03:34.714
<i>Today is our day we reclaim our Empire.</i>

03:34.797 --> 03:37.091
-Long live the Empire.
-Long live the Empire.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.473
Captain?

03:45.350 --> 03:47.227
Welcome back, Commander Landry.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.278
-They told us you were dead.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.155
-Not for a second, sir.
Sir.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.451
-Let's get you geared up.
-Sir.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.080
<i>Charon</i> has ten battalions
of Imperial guards on station.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.959
I don't know how you got here,
or how you got us all out alive,

04:11.042 --> 04:16.214
but we should withdraw, regroup.
We have supporters on several worlds.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.424
The emperor's ship is where we need to be.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.553
I have been to another universe and back.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.349
You think I'd come all this way
without a plan?

04:33.022 --> 04:33.982
-Clear.
-Clear.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.610
Stamets is gone.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.240
Coward probably left
at the first sign of trouble.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.993
All his research is still here.

04:45.743 --> 04:49.956
I've known more than one Stamets,
and they both have one thing in common.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.793
They love their work too much...

04:56.546 --> 04:58.715
to leave any of it behind.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.803
-Hello, Paul.
Gabriel.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.266
-I really hoped you were dead.
-You can't always get what you want.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.059
-Hi, doc.

05:12.562 --> 05:17.859
Ironically, I have to thank you
for helping me finish what I started.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.946
After you sold me out
and ruined our coup attempt,

05:22.488 --> 05:26.951
I was on Priors World recruiting allies
when the emperor caught up with the <i>Buran.</i>

05:29.454 --> 05:32.582
<i>As I beamed back to join the fight,</i>
<i>her torpedoes hit.</i>

05:34.292 --> 05:39.547
<i>And luckily, so did an ion storm,</i>
<i>which caused a transporter malfunction.</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:41.758
<i>And...</i>

05:43.968 --> 05:48.389
-I'm still stuck on the "not dead" part.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.807
A parallel universe.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.855
The ion storm must've swapped
your transporter signatures.

05:55.938 --> 06:01.235
To me, it was physics,
acting as the hand of destiny. My destiny.

06:04.113 --> 06:07.033
The bioweapon you're developing
for the emperor, show it to me.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.744
Happily, sir.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.395
Sensors have detected
mass casualties on Decks 1 through 17.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.981
He's come back from the grave
to stage a revolution

06:39.065 --> 06:40.525
and that's the best he's got?

06:41.067 --> 06:43.986
If he keeps doing that,
he'll reveal his location.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.530
Then he's mine.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.241
Emperor, I've seen firsthand
how he operates.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.327
He can get inside your head.
Manipulate you.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.330
-He is baiting you.

06:54.413 --> 06:58.459
He wants you to come to him.
Let me contact my ship again.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.628
They have no idea
they're flying into a battle zone.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.298
Please, Philippa.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.552
I'm not Philippa to you.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.054
But you are right about one thing.

07:10.138 --> 07:14.600
He preyed on my sentiment,
my weakness for your face.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.060
It will not happen again.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.021
Take her to the brig.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.984
Your choices have determined your fate.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.152
No.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.333
Go!

07:40.251 --> 07:42.462
-They'll find her, Emperor.
-Take your men.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.549
Bring Lorca to me alive.
I will kill him myself this time.

07:53.764 --> 07:59.979
<i>Captain's log, stardate 1834.2.</i>
<i>Acting Captain Saru recording.</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:03.065
<i>We are en route to the Terran flagship,</i>

08:03.149 --> 08:05.568
<i>having been summoned</i>
<i>by Specialist Burnham.</i>

08:05.902 --> 08:08.362
Discovery's<i> spore drive</i>
<i>is operational again,</i>

08:08.446 --> 08:11.949
<i>thanks to the full recovery</i>
<i>of our navigator, Lieutenant Stamets.</i>

08:12.992 --> 08:15.077
<i>Yet, despite his best efforts,</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:18.206
<i>the lieutenant was unable</i>
<i>to save </i>Discovery's<i> mycelium crop.</i>

08:19.957 --> 08:24.337
<i>His fear is that his Terran counterpart</i>
<i>has already contaminated the network.</i>

08:25.338 --> 08:29.509
<i>And, if so,</i>
<i>the results could be catastrophic.</i>

08:31.802 --> 08:33.638
What is it you wish to show me?

08:33.721 --> 08:36.516
We have less than 30 minutes
before we reach the Terran vessel.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.894
Airiam flagged it. A massive
energy signature off the central orb.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.354
It's mycelial.

08:41.437 --> 08:44.524
This is what my counterpart
has been using his mycelium for.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
-It powers their ship.
-As it does ours.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.029
Not exactly.
We ride along the network with the spores.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.241
That orb is pulling power
directly out of the network.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.327
But I thought the network
could regenerate itself.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.789
Typically, it does,
but this process is poisoning it.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.124
It's spreading infection back up
into the system.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.418
Without a fresh supply of spores,
it'll only get worse.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.088
The Terrans must be aware of this flaw.
It's not sustainable.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.423
I don't think sustainability
is their objective.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.843
But it does provide them with more energy
than I ever thought possible.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.845
Enough to run their city-sized ship

09:14.929 --> 09:17.014
and power weapons
that can destroy a planet.

09:17.098 --> 09:21.310
-As they did on Harlak.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.688
The Terrans are egotistical enough
to believe

09:23.771 --> 09:26.816
that they can replenish this resource
before it collapses.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.318
The other Stamets
must've been looking for a solution

09:29.402 --> 09:31.362
when he got trapped in the network
with me.

09:31.737 --> 09:36.701
If we don't stop them soon,
the contamination will be irreversible.

09:37.493 --> 09:41.205
The network will continue
to deteriorate everywhere.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.544
Here in this universe, back in ours,
across the entire multiverse.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.129
And when it does?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.758
Life as we know it will cease to exist.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.228
Take this ship-wide.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.065
Hello, Philippa.

10:09.025 --> 10:13.362
<i>I've watched for years... you let</i>
<i>alien races spill over the borders,</i>

10:13.446 --> 10:17.658
flourish in our backyard,
and have the gall to incite rebellion.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.330
<i>Terrans need a leader who will preserve</i>
<i>our way of life. Our race.</i>

10:23.873 --> 10:26.751
Try as you might, it's clearly not you.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.003
<i>Even Michael knew that.</i>

10:30.129 --> 10:31.714
<i>It was her great shame.</i>

10:32.381 --> 10:35.718
<i>Well, it's indecorous of me</i>
<i>to share pillow talk.</i>

10:36.636 --> 10:40.264
<i>To the rest, many of you know me,</i>
<i>some served with me.</i>

10:41.015 --> 10:45.895
<i>To all, I make this offer:</i>
<i>Renounce Georgiou.</i>

10:46.437 --> 10:49.815
<i>The Empire is dying in her hands,</i>
<i>but you don't have to.</i>

10:50.274 --> 10:51.108
<i>Not today.</i>

10:51.817 --> 10:55.112
<i>Michael Burnham is not to be touched.</i>

10:55.946 --> 10:58.574
<i>She is integral to our future plans,</i>

10:58.658 --> 11:04.163
<i>a future where we together</i>
<i>will make the Empire glorious again.</i>

11:04.246 --> 11:06.582
Got him. He's in the main labs.

11:12.588 --> 11:16.050
Lorca does not control this ship. I do.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.803
We take the fight to him.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.723
All hail the emperor!

11:55.673 --> 11:56.966
Don't shoot.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.391
Where are your troops?
-We were ambushed.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.103
How did you survive?

12:11.355 --> 12:12.481
Lorca spared me.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.694
-He said he wanted you to know...

12:19.071 --> 12:20.281
That he was here.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.126
Hello, Philippa. Did you miss me?

12:55.274 --> 12:56.525
Light her up.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.365
-Mr. Stamets.
-Containment field at 30 percent.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.533
Twenty-five percent.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.995
Five, four, three, two, it's down.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.296
-Flash grenade.
-Cover! Cover!

13:18.172 --> 13:19.632
Emergency transport.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
You didn't warn me
she could do that, Mr. Stamets.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.781
-Please tell me we can kill him now.
That depends if he can disable

13:43.864 --> 13:45.491
an emergency-transport system.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.702
I can. I can do that.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.579
Good.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.708
Set up a perimeter around
the throne room. Let's tighten the noose.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.673
Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i>
Do you copy? Come in, <i>Discovery.</i>

14:08.847 --> 14:11.684
Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i>
Do you copy? Come in.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.269
<i>Discovery,</i> do you copy?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.194
Come in.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.656
Please come in.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.286
Discovery <i>here. We are receiving you.</i>

14:31.912 --> 14:35.040
-<i>It's good to see you, Saru.</i>
-You as well, my friend.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.712
<i>It appears your situation has become dire.</i>
<i>Is the captain with you?</i>

14:40.963 --> 14:42.464
He's one of them. He's Terran.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.969
<i>He used us and the </i>Discovery
<i>to jump here to his own universe.</i>

14:47.052 --> 14:49.805
-<i>It was his plan all along.</i>
That's impossible.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.933
We would have sensed something.
I would have.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.728
That's why we didn't end up
at Starbase 46.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.148
Lorca altered the coordinates
of my last jump.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.274
How?

15:00.900 --> 15:05.112
He got the data he needed from those jumps
I did around the Klingon ship.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.073
Then all that was left was
to access navigation control,

15:08.157 --> 15:10.618
and he can do that from his chair. Lorca's staging a coup
against the emperor.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.373
<i>You have to abort coming</i>
<i>to the palace ship.</i>

15:16.790 --> 15:20.044
-Get as far away as you can.
-<i>I will not consider leaving you behind.</i>

15:20.127 --> 15:24.131
Saru, he has no need for our crew.
He will kill all of you.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.719
He might take <i>Discovery</i> to our universe
and bring the whole Terran fleet with him.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.555
Not if the Terrans
have wiped out all life already.

15:32.681 --> 15:36.101
They have created a super-mycelial reactor
on the <i>Charon,</i>

15:36.185 --> 15:40.898
and it's destroying the network.
When it goes, it takes all life with it.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.399
In all universes.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.198
How do we stop it?

15:49.281 --> 15:53.285
<i>Lieutenant Stamets believes a direct hit</i>
<i>from our photon torpedoes</i>

15:53.369 --> 15:56.622
on their energy orb
would create a detonation large enough

15:56.705 --> 16:01.460
to sever the reactor's connection
and allow the network to heal itself.

16:01.543 --> 16:05.214
We're running simulations
to account for energy dispersal.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.340
But?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.134
There's a containment field
protecting the orb.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.638
-Our weapons can't penetrate it.
-<i>Leave the containment field to me.</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:16.433
<i>Stay at warp so you can't be boarded,</i>

16:16.517 --> 16:19.103
<i>and I'll find a way to signal you</i>
<i>when I'm in place.</i>

16:19.603 --> 16:22.064
Be ready to blow up the reactor when I do.

16:24.942 --> 16:25.985
<i>Burnham out.</i>

16:43.794 --> 16:46.296
Your lack of vision continues
to disappoint me.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.966
I used to suffer from that, too.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.763
But nothing that's happened to me
was an accident.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.308
Not ending up in another world.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.353
Not finding a ship
that would help me return here.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.354
None of it.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.608
I'm living proof that fate is real.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.612
Speaking of which,
we've reached the tipping point

17:11.405 --> 17:15.451
where your usefulness to me is outweighed
by the risk of keeping you alive.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.704
I mean, I'm never gonna trust you.
Honestly. The living core of the mycelial network.

17:30.674 --> 17:35.137
It's poetic justice, don't you think?
Scientist destroyed by his own creation?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.139
Just kidding.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.682
I hate poetry.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.319
Sir, I'm getting word of
an unauthorized ship-to-ship transmission.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.363
That'll be my Burnham.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.128
<i>Hello, Michael.</i>

18:08.879 --> 18:12.716
<i>Judging from your communications hack,</i>
<i>you're somewhere on the third deck.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:15.886
<i>Where, precisely, I can't tell,</i>
<i>but no matter.</i>

18:15.969 --> 18:18.972
<i>I'm not gonna hunt you down.</i>
<i>I'll wait for you to come to me.</i>

18:19.640 --> 18:22.810

-Because you belong here.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.521

-In the real world.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.232
I know that's hard
for you to see right now,

18:28.315 --> 18:32.945
-because you're blinded by your emotions.
-<i>The only thing I was blinded by was you.</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:38.325
I know you understand
that I had to lie to you, Michael.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.618
<i>To get home.</i>

18:39.701 --> 18:44.748
<i>Just like you know that the Federation</i>
<i>is a social experiment doomed to failure.</i>

18:45.165 --> 18:46.667
<i>Childish idealism.</i>

18:46.750 --> 18:51.421
<i>Every species, every choice,</i>
<i>every opinion is not equal.</i>

18:51.505 --> 18:53.465
No matter how much they want it to be.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.176
The strong and the capable
will always rise.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.637
Like you and me.

18:59.596 --> 19:04.059
<i>And every living being is safer</i>
<i>and happier knowing their place.</i>

19:04.143 --> 19:06.145
<i>That's why we have a duty to lead.</i>

19:07.312 --> 19:09.481
<i>Like what you did that day</i>
<i>at the Binaries.</i>

19:10.566 --> 19:11.525
Stay with me.

19:12.025 --> 19:17.114
<i>Stay here and help me bring peace</i>
<i>to this world through strength and order.</i>

19:17.197 --> 19:18.031
<i>The right way.</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:20.909
There was no one else like the other you.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.330
<i>What she and I set out to achieve</i>
<i>was gonna be remarkable.</i>

19:26.331 --> 19:27.332
And then I met you.

19:28.375 --> 19:33.922
And the truth is, your gifts...
far surpass hers.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.510
<i>I see you, Michael Burnham.</i>

19:39.178 --> 19:40.888
<i>I see your power.</i>

19:40.971 --> 19:42.848
<i>And I'm offering you a future.</i>

19:44.600 --> 19:47.644
<i>I have since the day</i>
<i>I brought you onto the </i>Discovery<i>.</i>

19:48.187 --> 19:49.021
Take it.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.780
<i>She rerouted the feed</i>
<i>and disabled the carrier address.</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:01.867
<i>-She could be anywhere.</i>
<i></i>

20:03.368 --> 20:04.244
She'll come.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.307
How did you find me?

20:26.391 --> 20:29.770
My bracelet makes
my life signs undetectable.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.443
This is your sanctuary.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.530
Considering the situation,
it made sense you'd come here.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.115
I should have known.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.786
Lorca seduced you, too.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.413
Why would you say that?

20:48.747 --> 20:52.626
He broadcast it for everyone to hear.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.004
Why else would he protect you?

20:56.088 --> 20:59.091
Lorca believes destiny brought me to him.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.636
But he doesn't get to tell me
what my future is.

21:03.220 --> 21:07.182
I'm responsible for forging my own path.
We all are.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.103
-My Philippa taught me that.
-This...

21:13.647 --> 21:15.232
belonged to my Michael.

21:15.732 --> 21:19.319
Now Lorca has taken everything from me.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.530
You lost a daughter.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.907
An empire.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.412
I lost a captain...

21:31.456 --> 21:32.457
and a life.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.553
Both versions of me
betrayed both versions of you.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.891
I won't let that happen again.
And I won't let you die again.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.519
So that's what happened to me
on your side.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.899
I'm gonna stop Lorca.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.030
I see why he is so enamored with you.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.742
You almost make me believe you can do it.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.452
I will do it.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.582
For what he's done to me.
For what he's done

22:13.665 --> 22:16.376
to all the innocent people
who have stood in his way.

22:17.919 --> 22:21.673
And for the loss of life to come,
if no one stops him here.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.051
Today.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.346
What is your plan?

22:29.931 --> 22:32.017
Disable the orb's containment field.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.812
Those controls are in the throne room.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.190
How will you get to them?

22:39.149 --> 22:41.526
By giving Lorca exactly what he wants.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.654
We have a problem.

22:44.738 --> 22:49.242
We knew the orb harnessed exotic energy
by blocking the flow of the network,

22:49.326 --> 22:52.746
but we didn't know that all those
mycelial spores packed in together

22:52.829 --> 22:55.791
created hypergravitational
and magnetic fields, too.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.294
Even a blast from photon torpedoes
won't be enough to free it.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.006
We'll have to create a chain reaction.
Overload it with potential energy.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.717
What do we have that harnesses
that kind of power?

23:06.176 --> 23:07.177
Uh...

23:07.761 --> 23:08.970
Our harvested spores.

23:09.221 --> 23:13.016
They hold enough energy
to power us across galaxies.

23:13.975 --> 23:17.187
We should modify our warheads
by loading them up.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.815
How much of our spore supply
would we need to use?

23:21.274 --> 23:24.820
All of it.
We won't be able to jump back home.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.201
We need to get in close for a clear shot.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.578
The orb is in the heart
of that superstructure.

23:33.662 --> 23:37.040
I don't think we could outmaneuver
a blast like that if we're that close.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.792
I just ran the simulations.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.921
<i>Discovery's</i> shields aren't strong enough
to protect us from the energy wave

23:43.004 --> 23:44.881
that will be released when the network
is freed.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.385
The shock wave will incinerate us. I don't think we can make it out alive.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.483
It is well-known...

24:04.484 --> 24:08.655
that my species has the ability
to sense the coming of death.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.119
I do not sense it today.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.289
I may not have all the answers.

24:17.831 --> 24:22.544
However, I do know that I am surrounded
by a team I trust.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.298
The finest a captain could ever hope
to command.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.885
Lorca abused our idealism.

24:31.428 --> 24:36.266
And make no mistake,
<i>Discovery </i>is no longer Lorca's.

24:37.767 --> 24:38.810
She is ours.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.940
And today will be her maiden voyage.

24:44.816 --> 24:49.654
We have a duty to perform.
And we will not accept a no-win scenario.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.409
You have your orders. On your way.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.119
Aye, Captain.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.793
We've executed her lords
and senior officers, sir.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.088
The rest of the crew
are swearing allegiance to you.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.006
Good.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.635
I was just thinking about everyone
who's ever said

25:11.718 --> 25:15.222
that victory felt empty
when it was attained.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.891
What a bunch of idiots they were.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.025
She's here.  Michael.

25:42.874 --> 25:43.959
What's this about?

25:44.376 --> 25:46.670
I won't let another crew die on my watch,
Gabriel.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.677
I've been here long enough to know

25:53.760 --> 25:56.638
that if you want your claim to the throne
to be legitimate...

25:57.764 --> 25:59.599
you have to execute the emperor.

26:04.562 --> 26:08.525
And you're prepared
to condemn Philippa here to death?

26:08.942 --> 26:12.696
What you said on the shuttle yesterday...
was right.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.573
She's not my Philippa.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.576
That's very Terran of you.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.577
But you and I both know
that I have her now.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.833
-I think you know.

26:27.627 --> 26:32.007
In exchange for my crew...
I offer you me.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.510
Let them leave safely, and I'm yours.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.220
Like you said,

26:38.054 --> 26:41.016
my future is here.

26:43.435 --> 26:47.480
But know this:
I'm offering you my mind, nothing more.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.279
Until you've completely settled in...

26:57.032 --> 26:58.408
I'm sure you understand.

27:06.458 --> 27:11.171
Well, it looks like you are destined
to be betrayed

27:11.254 --> 27:14.299
by Burnhams in every universe.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.051
No.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.637
I'm destined to kill you.

27:20.013 --> 27:20.972
Well.

27:21.431 --> 27:25.602
That would certainly
be an impressive trick.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.527
Welcome home, Michael.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.000
Captain was right.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.253
What about?
-"Do not accept a no-win scenario."

27:52.337 --> 27:57.092
There may be a way out of this after all.
I've reanalyzed the simulations.

27:58.259 --> 28:01.179
Now, if we blow the reactor core,

28:01.262 --> 28:04.682
the resulting explosion
will be pure mycelial energy, right?

28:05.225 --> 28:06.059
Right.

28:07.268 --> 28:10.063
Right, but not just an explosion.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.983
According to this,
the mother of mycelial shock waves.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.653
If we can stay right on the leading edge,

28:16.736 --> 28:19.781
we can ride it long enough
for the energy to activate the drive,

28:19.864 --> 28:22.283
-and then you can navigate us home.
-But, um...

28:22.951 --> 28:26.371
The ship's shields still
aren't strong enough to protect us.

28:26.454 --> 28:30.250
Unless we modify the spore drive
to run concurrently with the warp drive.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.837
The resulting warp bubble may provide
a secondary layer of protection.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.422
A shield from the blast.

28:36.047 --> 28:39.509
If I reverse-engineer the coordinates
that Lorca used to get us here,

28:39.592 --> 28:42.929
I should be able
to pinpoint the right pathway to take.

28:43.012 --> 28:47.183
And that will get us to the same point
in our timeline, or at least close to it.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.562
There'll be infinite pathways opening up.
That's gonna be really...

28:50.645 --> 28:52.856
"Hard" is the word you're looking for.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.568
But I don't accept no-win scenarios.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.864
Thank you for your inspiration, cadet.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.953
Now, please, inform the captain
of your findings.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.039
Looks like we may be going home after all.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.878
Message from the <i>Charon</i>.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.630
We're advised it's safe
to drop out of warp.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.508
The message has
Burnham's security code on it.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.847
-Lieutenant Detmer, drop us out of warp.
-Yes, Captain.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.563
Captain, we're being hailed.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.065
It's Lorca, sir.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.573
On-screen.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.201
<i>Mr. Saru.</i>

29:47.410 --> 29:48.620
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

29:50.497 --> 29:54.250
<i>I'm glad I got a chance to say goodbye</i>
<i>to you and the rest of the crew.</i>

29:55.251 --> 30:00.340
I want you to know that my admiration
for you was and is sincere.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.760
When I look at you, I see...

30:04.469 --> 30:07.305
a formidable unit of soldiers
that I sculpted.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.684
<i>If I thought for a second</i>
<i>that any of you were capable</i>

30:11.768 --> 30:15.480
<i>of relinquishing this cult-like devotion</i>
<i>to the Federation,</i>

30:16.022 --> 30:18.066
<i>I'd enlist your skills today.</i>

30:18.149 --> 30:21.820
We are not interested in your sentiments.
Where is Specialist Burnham?

30:21.903 --> 30:23.446
<i>She's fine.</i>

30:24.781 --> 30:28.409
<i>You don't die today</i>
<i>because she chose to stay by my side.</i>

30:28.493 --> 30:31.621
I would like to hear that from her.
You are not a reliable source.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.625
<i>I'm where I need to be, Saru.</i>

30:36.918 --> 30:37.919
This is my place.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.674
That is all I needed to see.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.562
Fire!

31:04.237 --> 31:06.865
-Keep your eye on that containment field.
-Aye, Captain.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.199
Detmer, give Rhys a clear shot.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.826
-Yes, sir.
Let's go, people.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.025
Wait.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.862
Stop.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.702
-Don't make me have to kill you.
-You won't.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.764
We would've helped you get home
if you had asked.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.977
That's who Starfleet is.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.230
That's who I am.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.739
-That's why I won't kill you now.
But I will.

34:01.914 --> 34:02.790
We...

34:03.624 --> 34:04.625
We could have...

34:40.995 --> 34:42.246
It was a good plan.

34:46.292 --> 34:49.003
Burnham did it.
The containment field is down.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.507
-Beam her back. Now.
-I can't get a lock. I'm working on it.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.424
Work faster.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.637
You fought well. For a moment...

35:00.765 --> 35:02.517
I thought I had her back with me.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.399
Lorca's troops.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.945
I will buy you some time.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.785
I am a defeated emperor.
They've seen my neck.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.453
I have no future now.

35:23.454 --> 35:27.416
But I will die on my feet,
as fitting my station.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.211
Go, Michael Burnham.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.297
Find a way home.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.591
Live.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.274
Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i>

35:51.357 --> 35:52.942
-I've got her.
-Get her out now.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.795
She's onboard.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.922
-Black alert.
-Aye, Captain.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.760
<i>Black alert. Black alert.</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:35.109
Lock weapons onto that ship.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.777
The Terran ship is targeting us.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.863
-Now or never, Detmer.
-Aye, Captain.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.380
What the hell are they doing?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.344
Is the containment field up?

37:04.764 --> 37:06.515
Locked on, Captain.
-Fire.

37:06.599 --> 37:07.642
Aye, sir.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.567
-Warp speed. Now.
-Yes, sir.

37:28.287 --> 37:30.915
Ambient mycelial energy
is interacting with the drive.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.717
-Levels looks good.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.680
-Engage the spore drive. Now.
-Aye, Captain.

38:09.328 --> 38:12.039
It's working. The network is regenerating.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.639
Heat shields at maximum.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.685
The pathways are bifurcating too quickly.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.237
I don't know where to go.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.951
The network is a gift. It's the thread
that weaves life through space.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.041
I can't even find my way out.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.921
-Follow the music, Paul.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.840
Open your eyes.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.979
Wait. It's the clearing in the forest.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.169
Thanks, Hugh.

40:22.711 --> 40:23.712
Tilly...

40:25.923 --> 40:29.427
Reboot the system
and find out where we are.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.804
And when.

40:39.186 --> 40:41.439
What have you done to me?

40:44.233 --> 40:48.654
Captain, celestial patterns
and subatomic analysis confirm

40:48.737 --> 40:50.739
we are in our Alpha quadrant.

40:50.823 --> 40:51.824
Ah.

40:51.907 --> 40:58.247
But we overshot by nine months.

41:04.670 --> 41:08.090
Mr. Bryce,
send a transmission to Starfleet.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.718
-Inform them we have returned.
-Aye, Captain.

41:12.052 --> 41:15.264
Mr. Rhys, update our tactical map.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.600
-I need to see the status of the war.
-Aye, sir.

41:20.728 --> 41:24.356
Captain, there's no response
from the Federation to our signal.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.942
Not even an automated one.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.777
What does that mean?

41:28.861 --> 41:30.779
War map on-screen, Captain.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.831
If the map is to be believed...

41:43.042 --> 41:44.001
it appears...

41:45.586 --> 41:47.671
the Klingons have won the war.
