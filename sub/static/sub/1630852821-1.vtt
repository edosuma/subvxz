01:37.847 --> 01:39.014
Hi.

01:40.381 --> 01:42.517
Yeah, you're awake.

01:42.584 --> 01:45.553
Yeah. I have an early
spin class this morning.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.589
And then an interview
with some women's magazine

01:47.690 --> 01:49.191
and then lunch with Helen.

01:49.257 --> 01:50.358
Ah, send her my love.

01:50.492 --> 01:53.428
I will.

01:53.528 --> 01:56.866
Ugh, you look tired.

01:56.932 --> 01:58.734
I'll be happy
when the shoot's done.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.435
Why don't I come out
next week?

02:00.535 --> 02:02.104
Just for a few days.

02:02.204 --> 02:05.607
I mean, yeah, if you can that
would be ama... oh, no, wait.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.110
<i>Ah, no,
next week won't work.</i>

02:08.210 --> 02:10.012
- <i>We're on night shoots.</i>
- Oh.

02:10.079 --> 02:11.379
And the week after that.

02:11.513 --> 02:15.383
Um. What about the 10th?

02:15.450 --> 02:16.719
Ugh. I can't.

02:16.852 --> 02:18.788
I'll be getting ready
for my film.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.791
It's okay, my love.
It was just an idea.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.092
Never mind.

02:23.225 --> 02:25.360
Yeah, but I do mind.

02:27.462 --> 02:28.697
How's the shoot going?

02:28.764 --> 02:30.232
It's fine.

02:30.365 --> 02:31.299
No, I mean, it's good.

02:31.399 --> 02:32.701
We're only a day
behind schedule,

02:32.768 --> 02:35.738
but the studio are happy
with the dailies, so.

02:35.871 --> 02:37.572
- And your star?
- <i>Alexandra?</i>

02:37.706 --> 02:38.808
Um-hmm.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.243
She. is. good.

02:41.376 --> 02:42.310
Better than me?

02:42.410 --> 02:45.080
Oh, no. She's way
better than you.

02:45.147 --> 02:46.081
And younger.

02:46.215 --> 02:48.083
Yeah. Yeah, much younger.

02:48.217 --> 02:52.288
And very, very, very boring.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.757
Oh!
Well, tell me more about that.

02:54.824 --> 02:55.991
<i>Oh, are you jealous?</i>

02:56.091 --> 02:58.426
Desperately.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.495
Darling,
I'm so sorry.

03:00.595 --> 03:01.997
I'm falling asleep here.

03:02.097 --> 03:04.767
Okay. I miss you.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.237
- I miss you, too.
- I love you.

03:08.304 --> 03:09.504
I love you, too.

03:24.854 --> 03:25.955
Hello!

03:27.022 --> 03:28.791
Oh, you look well.

03:28.858 --> 03:29.692
Give me a hug.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.961
Oh, thank you.
I feel well.

03:32.094 --> 03:35.264
Just did a spin class
and I feel springy and taut.

03:35.331 --> 03:37.498
I could eat a horse.

03:37.632 --> 03:39.969
Good afternoon, Maggie.

03:40.035 --> 03:41.036
The usual, I suppose?

03:41.136 --> 03:42.470
Yes, please.

03:42.604 --> 03:44.940
Chopped salad, no dressing,
and a pot of Earl Grey.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.108
- Thank you.
- That's not a horse.

03:46.175 --> 03:47.710
That's not even
a miniature Shetland pony.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.012
I'll have the club burger,
rare, extra fries,

03:50.145 --> 03:51.680
and another one of those.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.016
Superb. I'll bring you
something special.

03:54.149 --> 03:55.550
Thank you.

03:55.651 --> 03:57.552
I have to tell you.

03:57.653 --> 04:01.489
<i>Cat Skills</i> is picking up
a lot of heat.

04:01.623 --> 04:05.627
Traction, whatever.
All I can say is,

04:05.694 --> 04:08.396
you'd better start
gearing up for award season.

04:09.631 --> 04:11.466
Time to practice
that acceptance speech,

04:11.532 --> 04:14.469
even if it's only in the mirror.
Gettin' my drift?

04:14.535 --> 04:15.871
Don't be ridiculous.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.173
What's ridiculous about
you winning an award, darling?

04:19.308 --> 04:21.142
It's your turn.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.577
And you need one to go
with Christopher's.

04:22.678 --> 04:23.913
They can be bookends.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.683
I just
want to focus on <i>Paper Scissor</i>,

04:27.816 --> 04:29.852
which now that you've read it.

04:31.353 --> 04:32.587
Oh, Helen, come on.

04:32.688 --> 04:34.056
Lucca read it.

04:34.189 --> 04:35.824
Lucca's the intern.

04:35.891 --> 04:37.693
When do I have time to read

04:37.760 --> 04:39.594
anything longer than a menu?

04:44.366 --> 04:45.600
So for real.

04:45.701 --> 04:47.670
All this award seasons talk.

04:47.736 --> 04:49.872
You're not joking?
They really like <i>Cat Skills</i> ?

04:49.939 --> 04:52.207
The word
on the grapevine is.

04:52.274 --> 04:54.944
you are a shoe-in for top spot.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.211
That's all I'm saying.

04:56.345 --> 04:57.746
Oh, I don't know.

04:58.781 --> 05:00.249
Lips are sealed.

05:00.382 --> 05:01.216
That's exciting.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.284
It's okay.

05:02.384 --> 05:04.053
I'm excited too.

05:04.119 --> 05:05.054
Bring the bottle.

06:30.005 --> 06:31.507
<i>Darling, I am so sorry.</i>

06:31.639 --> 06:32.808
<i>I didn't mean
for this to happen.</i>

06:32.941 --> 06:35.377
<i>I didn't want you
to find out like this.</i>

06:35.477 --> 06:36.812
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

06:36.945 --> 06:39.114
<i>The press... I... I mean,
I know that's not an excuse.</i>

06:39.181 --> 06:42.117
<i>But Christ, Maggie,
it's not you.</i>

06:42.184 --> 06:45.988
<i>It's not us.
It just happened.</i>

06:46.055 --> 06:48.390
<i>Please, when you get this,
will you call me?</i>

06:48.490 --> 06:51.160
<i>Just. call me, okay?</i>

07:02.570 --> 07:04.907
I am so, so sorry.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.475
How long?

07:07.810 --> 07:09.711
- Uh.
- Is that her?

07:09.845 --> 07:10.846
Is she there?

07:10.913 --> 07:12.347
Maggie, uh, no, no, no, uh.

07:12.414 --> 07:13.348
I'm sorry.

07:13.415 --> 07:14.383
We are both sorry.

07:14.516 --> 07:16.218
I don't care how sorry she is.

07:16.351 --> 07:17.319
<i>How long?</i>

07:17.386 --> 07:21.056
Um. uh, not long.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.991
How long?

07:23.058 --> 07:24.860
I don't know.
A couple of months.

07:24.993 --> 07:30.032
Um, come... coming up on a year,
maybe.

07:30.099 --> 07:30.899
Ugh.

07:31.033 --> 07:31.867
<i>Maggie, it wasn't</i>

07:32.000 --> 07:33.435
<i>meant to happen like this.</i>

07:33.535 --> 07:34.770
Ugh, I bet it wasn't.

07:34.870 --> 07:37.605
No, the press, I...
I don't know how they knew.

07:37.706 --> 07:39.441
Do you love her?

07:39.541 --> 07:42.845
No. It's... it's complicated.

07:42.911 --> 07:44.913
It's not that hard
of a question.

07:46.748 --> 07:49.384
She's pregnant. Um.

07:49.451 --> 07:50.385
<i>Maggie, I'm so...</i>

07:54.456 --> 07:56.125
Why?

08:02.397 --> 08:03.232
Hello?

08:05.701 --> 08:06.802
Mags?

08:08.070 --> 08:08.971
Oh, Fee.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.708
Mags, are you okay?

08:12.774 --> 08:17.546
I just saw the news.
Is it true?

08:17.613 --> 08:20.048
He says he loves her and.

08:22.451 --> 08:24.119
she's pregnant.

08:24.253 --> 08:28.090
Right. So.

08:28.223 --> 08:31.493
Mags, there's a flight
leaving Gatwick for St. Kitts

08:31.593 --> 08:32.760
this afternoon.

08:32.828 --> 08:34.096
I can't, Fee.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.931
I have to start a movie
in Cape Town in a month.

08:36.063 --> 08:38.232
<i>It's not up for
discussion, Mags.</i>

08:38.299 --> 08:39.934
You get on that plane.

08:40.001 --> 08:44.273
And you come to Nevis,
and you let me take care of you.

08:44.339 --> 08:46.441
You let the island
take care of you.

08:46.508 --> 08:51.113
<i>You'll spend two weeks here,
sleeping, swimming</i>

08:51.180 --> 08:54.183
and doing whatever
it is that you need to heal.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.484
Okay.

08:55.617 --> 08:57.019
<i>Ah, good.</i>

08:57.119 --> 08:59.621
Good, because I already
bought the ticket.

08:59.688 --> 09:04.326
So, Mags, go pack.

09:04.459 --> 09:05.260
Yeah.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.428
I'll text you
the flight details

09:06.495 --> 09:11.767
and next time you see me,
you'll be in Nevis.

09:11.833 --> 09:12.968
Okay?

09:14.636 --> 09:15.537
Yeah.

09:23.378 --> 09:24.646
Maggie.

09:24.713 --> 09:26.148
Have you talked
to your husband, Maggie?

09:28.150 --> 09:30.619
Have you spoken to Chris?
Is there no going back?

09:30.687 --> 09:32.888
Will you go away!

09:32.988 --> 09:35.490
Get out of my way!
Get that out of my face!

09:35.624 --> 09:36.525
Step away!

09:39.662 --> 09:40.896
Get out of my way!

09:42.364 --> 09:45.067
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves!

10:10.392 --> 10:11.326
Come here.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.863
Baby, no, no, no,

10:14.997 --> 10:15.998
no, no, no, no.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.338
Oh.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.175
No tears now, okay?

10:28.176 --> 10:29.679
I just can't
stop crying all the time.

10:33.115 --> 10:35.617
Baby, I'm so sorry.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.386
We'll take care
of you here, okay?

10:39.855 --> 10:41.556
We've got you, okay?

10:45.027 --> 10:46.862
Check this out.

10:46.928 --> 10:49.798
What do you say, huh?

10:49.898 --> 10:51.967
It's beautiful.

10:52.067 --> 10:55.604
And you know what?
You never get used to it.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.406
Right, shall we?

12:15.150 --> 12:17.886
Why haven't I
come to visit sooner?

12:17.986 --> 12:19.321
'Cause you
didn't need to.

12:21.523 --> 12:25.994
Oh, and that's Sam,
our renowned chef.

12:26.128 --> 12:27.329
Renowned.

12:31.466 --> 12:32.367
This way.

12:36.138 --> 12:37.305
Welcome.

12:37.372 --> 12:40.175
.to your home
away from home.

12:40.308 --> 12:41.744
It's beautiful.

12:45.815 --> 12:47.082
Gonna be all right, Mags.

12:49.017 --> 12:50.185
I promise.

12:57.159 --> 12:59.829
This is what happens
to other people.

12:59.896 --> 13:01.263
not us.

13:02.998 --> 13:06.168
And somehow, I feel ashamed.

13:06.234 --> 13:08.036
Did you have any inkling?

13:08.103 --> 13:10.372
Nothing.

13:10.505 --> 13:11.540
Nothing at all.

13:11.674 --> 13:15.711
I mean, I knew he was having
a tough shoot and that.

13:15.778 --> 13:16.779
he was tired.

13:18.781 --> 13:19.749
Now I know why.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.616
Um-hmm.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.019
I know when it started.

13:24.085 --> 13:28.390
It's when he went to LA.
to see her for the movie.

13:32.627 --> 13:35.464
What's wrong with me, Fee?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.567
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong with you.

13:41.436 --> 13:43.572
And you knew
where I was a year ago?

13:44.807 --> 13:47.075
I was in a clinic
at Palm Springs.

13:48.778 --> 13:53.415
Getting an eyelift,
and a, and a skin rejuvenation.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.050
Why?

13:55.116 --> 13:56.251
You're perfect.

13:56.318 --> 13:58.253
Why?

13:58.320 --> 14:00.756
It was Christopher's idea.

14:00.823 --> 14:03.258
That's devious.

14:03.325 --> 14:04.593
And you know,
then it hit me

14:04.660 --> 14:10.165
that while I was worrying
about trying to look my age,

14:10.265 --> 14:12.601
he was off with some bimbo,

14:12.668 --> 14:15.838
getting it on
who was half my age.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.940
Ugh. You know what?

14:18.073 --> 14:20.342
I hate women
who hurt other women.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.911
Like, why?

14:21.978 --> 14:24.513
What's so hard about
"he's married?"

14:24.613 --> 14:25.413
"She's married."

14:25.480 --> 14:27.415
Like what's...
what's difficult?

14:27.482 --> 14:29.451
And now she's having his baby?

14:29.584 --> 14:30.352
Yeah.

14:30.452 --> 14:33.622
I mean, I never asked.

14:33.689 --> 14:35.624
Did you want children?

14:35.691 --> 14:39.160
I just assumed you guys
were too busy with work.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.130
But I wanted children.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.267
Desperately.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.203
And Christopher didn't.

14:48.336 --> 14:51.273
He was terrified
of becoming a parent.

14:52.307 --> 14:55.644
Well,
he's in for a rude awakening.

14:55.778 --> 14:58.146
He's about to
find out just how loud

14:58.213 --> 15:00.515
the pitter-patter of small,
tiny feet can be.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.985
He deserves
every sleepless night

15:03.118 --> 15:04.553
and every full diaper.

15:04.654 --> 15:08.557
In fact, I hope
he gets triplets.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.992
Okay, listen.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.493
You're my number one priority.

15:11.626 --> 15:13.228
I have canceled
everything and everyone

15:13.328 --> 15:14.730
for the next two weeks.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.033
Screw the other guests. Okay?

15:17.165 --> 15:21.102
But for right now, I want you
to get a good night's sleep.

15:21.202 --> 15:24.472
In fact, take as many days
as you need.

15:24.539 --> 15:25.507
Okay?

15:25.640 --> 15:30.913
So, I'll check in on you,
but I won't intrude.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.683
Unless I get bored and then
I'll come and poke you awake.

15:33.749 --> 15:35.350
Yeah.

15:35.483 --> 15:36.852
Then I'm gonna
leave you to it.

15:39.321 --> 15:40.522
I love you, Mags.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.861
I love you.

19:24.814 --> 19:25.881
Hey.

19:27.315 --> 19:29.251
Hi.

19:29.317 --> 19:30.385
I thought
you'd like some company

19:30.451 --> 19:34.256
after that long hibernation.

19:34.389 --> 19:36.591
I'd like some company.

19:36.659 --> 19:40.062
All right.
I was so bored.

19:40.129 --> 19:43.132
I was sitting there
willing you to wake up.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.599
And here you are.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.136
How long
was I sleeping for?

19:47.269 --> 19:50.306
Two and a half,
maybe three days.

19:50.438 --> 19:53.742
Wow.

19:53.809 --> 19:54.743
You hungry?

19:57.012 --> 20:00.316
You know, at some point
I had some papaya.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.251
It was really good.

20:02.318 --> 20:06.121
Yeah.
But that's not enough.

20:06.255 --> 20:07.857
You need feeding.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.425
You need sustenance.

20:10.491 --> 20:13.028
You say that
as if I'm a 12-year-old

20:13.128 --> 20:15.764
or someone who's really ill.

20:15.831 --> 20:18.701
You're recovering
from a broken heart.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.804
People used to die from those
in the old days.

20:21.937 --> 20:24.173
For real.

20:24.306 --> 20:29.477
So, why don't I ask Sam
to prepare a tray for you?

20:30.445 --> 20:33.115
Right.
Sam, the chef.

20:33.182 --> 20:35.351
The guy who likes to take a
dip at dawn.

20:35.483 --> 20:36.517
Yeah, what say you?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.486
Hmm?

20:38.620 --> 20:39.688
Are you feeling this?

20:40.723 --> 20:44.827
I mean,
you know, it's okay.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.864
Go on. You can say
you love it.

20:48.998 --> 20:52.634
I don't know,
I think it's kind of quiet.

20:52.701 --> 20:54.236
Maybe even too quiet.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.171
Yeah.
But peaceful, right?

20:57.472 --> 20:58.406
But hot.

20:58.506 --> 21:03.411
You know,
just maybe even too hot.

21:03.511 --> 21:04.980
Yeah. Um-hmm.

21:05.047 --> 21:08.350
But you see, that's where
the pool comes in handy.

22:56.591 --> 22:57.459
Oh.

22:57.525 --> 22:58.460
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

23:00.029 --> 23:03.165
- Good morning.
- Yes.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.867
Oh my gosh. You know,
if this were a movie,

23:04.967 --> 23:07.302
it would be that clichÃ©
romantic comedy moment.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.041
Yeah. I, um, I don't
watch a lot of movies.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.710
Oh. Right.

23:14.810 --> 23:18.347
You're, uh,
you're Fiona's guest, right?

23:18.480 --> 23:21.649
Yes. Yes.
Maggie Russell.

23:21.717 --> 23:23.118
Right.

23:23.185 --> 23:24.319
Fiona's cousin.

23:24.386 --> 23:26.188
Right. Yeah.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.222
Okay.

23:29.058 --> 23:30.159
I'm Sam.

23:30.292 --> 23:31.060
I'm... I'm sorry.

23:32.861 --> 23:34.463
- I'm, um.
- Yes. Right.

23:34.530 --> 23:36.999
I'm here if you need me
for anything.

23:37.132 --> 23:38.633
And you do wonderful
things with vanilla.

23:40.035 --> 23:41.737
Well, I... I try my best. Yeah.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.038
Oh, and papaya.

23:43.105 --> 23:44.873
Oh my God. The way
you just cubed that.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.410
I... I... I mean,
I would just mess it up.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.412
D-Do you cook?

23:50.512 --> 23:53.248
No, I wouldn't
call it cooking.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.752
I mainly just chuck a bunch
of things into a blender.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.021
- Mostly kale.
- Ah, sauce.

23:59.088 --> 24:00.422
Yeah.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.193
Uh, do you...

24:04.326 --> 24:07.396
do you want to come to the
kitchen and, um, see what I do?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.000
Sure, yeah.

24:12.067 --> 24:13.435
Really?

24:13.535 --> 24:16.839
Yeah. I mean,
if you want me to.

24:16.905 --> 24:18.674
Yes. Yes, please.

24:18.740 --> 24:19.708
That would be great.

24:19.842 --> 24:21.043
That'd be great.

24:21.110 --> 24:22.211
So, you take the fruit
that you've cut in half.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.881
just like that.

24:25.948 --> 24:28.684
It helps when it's...
when it's ripe.

24:28.750 --> 24:34.223
And then you slice off
the top and the bottom.

24:34.289 --> 24:36.892
And you just very gently
peel off the skin.

24:38.594 --> 24:40.429
You make it look
so easy.

24:40.562 --> 24:41.897
And then with what's left,

24:41.964 --> 24:46.468
you slice it and dice it
into little cubes.

24:58.113 --> 25:01.817
Why is that
the best papaya ever?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.152
What did you do to it?

25:03.252 --> 25:07.089
Well, I only...
I only just picked it.

25:07.156 --> 25:08.323
Are you okay?

25:08.423 --> 25:09.925
I'm sorry.

25:10.058 --> 25:14.163
Just, uh, I seem to
be crying a lot at the moment.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.268
It just sort of
hits me and then,

25:19.334 --> 25:20.969
and then I can't stop.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.072
It's weird because I never cry.

25:26.842 --> 25:28.310
Fiona told me what happened.

25:30.646 --> 25:32.181
I'm sorry.

25:35.184 --> 25:36.318
I've been trying to think
how I would feel

25:36.451 --> 25:39.288
if I was in your situation
and I think.

25:39.354 --> 25:44.026
apart from betrayal,
I think I'd feel. confused.

25:46.495 --> 25:48.330
So, you do know
who I am.

25:50.499 --> 25:52.669
And you know how I feel.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.136
Yeah.

25:54.269 --> 25:56.238
I think
I'm gonna cry again.

25:56.338 --> 25:59.141
You came
to the right place, you know.

25:59.274 --> 26:00.175
What? The hotel?

26:00.309 --> 26:04.146
No, no, no. The island.
It's strong medicine.

26:08.850 --> 26:10.719
Come on. You want a go?

26:10.819 --> 26:12.621
Oh, uh, no.

26:12.689 --> 26:15.457
I'll probably just get juice
all over myself.

26:15.524 --> 26:19.828
Um, I should
probably go find Fiona.

26:19.895 --> 26:22.331
She'll, uh,
she'll be in the dome.

26:22.464 --> 26:24.166
Okay.

26:24.233 --> 26:26.902
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you bet.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.108
Hey.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.876
Hey, did you get lost?

27:08.010 --> 27:09.712
I
was beginning to worry

27:09.778 --> 27:11.446
you'd fallen back asleep.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.618
Where is everyone?
I thought you said it was busy.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.053
Oh, I'm sold out.

27:18.186 --> 27:20.222
Everybody does their own thing.

27:20.355 --> 27:23.125
So many places to
hide around here.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.294
But they'll all be back tonight.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.464
Sam's reputation just guarantees
a full restaurant every night.

27:29.564 --> 27:31.734
So lucky to have him.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.268
Yeah, you are.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.773
What is that mountain
over there?

27:36.905 --> 27:40.108
Ah, not a mountain.
It's a volcano.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.780
And, um, I was actually thinking
of taking you hiking there

27:43.912 --> 27:46.716
one of these days
when you feel stronger.

27:46.783 --> 27:49.752
When you get your mojo back.

27:49.885 --> 27:53.622
And maybe
some sensible shoes.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.090
These are ridiculous,
aren't they?

27:55.223 --> 27:58.994
No.
They are ridiculously gorgeous.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.430
I'm just jealous 'cause you're
always good in high heels.

28:01.563 --> 28:05.934
Me? Anything over an inch
and I go all wobbly.

28:08.437 --> 28:14.009
Listen, um, I wanna strike
a happy balance between,

28:14.109 --> 28:16.011
you know,
showing you the island,

28:16.111 --> 28:20.082
taking you out of yourself,

28:20.148 --> 28:21.917
and letting you
rest and recover.

28:21.983 --> 28:23.919
So, will you let me know

28:23.985 --> 28:27.289
if I'm doing too much
or not enough?

28:32.762 --> 28:34.697
You did not deserve this.

28:39.669 --> 28:41.169
It's not your fault.

28:42.371 --> 28:43.538
Okay?

28:46.641 --> 28:47.609
Please don't cry.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.980
Please don't.
I can't take it, you know.

28:52.981 --> 28:53.816
You want some tea?

28:56.017 --> 28:57.720
Yeah.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.559
I sound like my mom.
Tea.

29:07.028 --> 29:08.698
Thank you.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.805
Hi.
Just passing through.

30:58.006 --> 30:59.174
Hi.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.475
Hi.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.778
Hi. Sorry,
I just wanted to stop by

31:02.912 --> 31:04.479
and say thank you for these.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.615
Well, it's a pleasure.

31:06.682 --> 31:07.950
They look great on you.

31:08.016 --> 31:09.518
Thanks.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.754
Oh God,
it smells so good in here.

31:11.821 --> 31:13.689
Smells like my childhood.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.158
You know, I used to help
make bread when I was a kid.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.794
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:18.861 --> 31:19.929
Where was that?

31:19.996 --> 31:21.196
Ah, in Provence.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.699
My family actually
had a holiday home there.

31:23.799 --> 31:24.967
Wow.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.802
Where are you from?

31:26.869 --> 31:28.103
Montana.

31:28.169 --> 31:29.772
- Montana?
- Yep.

31:29.839 --> 31:33.308
Wow.
How did you end up here?

31:33.441 --> 31:36.478
Well, I was young, younger.

31:36.545 --> 31:39.347
Um, and I wanted
to see the world.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.483
And I came out here
with a friend and I.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.152
I never left.

31:44.286 --> 31:46.488
I can see how that happens.

31:46.621 --> 31:49.357
Do you ever go back?
To Provence?

31:49.491 --> 31:54.030
Oh, uh, no.
My parents died when I was 12.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.399
And, uh, the house
got sold and.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.869
yeah, there's nothing left.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.369
Except you.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.239
I mean, you're still here.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.141
Yeah.

32:06.207 --> 32:07.677
Do you want a go?

32:09.045 --> 32:11.546
Uh, yeah.

32:11.681 --> 32:12.982
- Yes? Okay, okay.
- Sure. Why not.

32:13.049 --> 32:13.916
Just grab that right there.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.183
- Okay.
- Turn it out.

32:15.250 --> 32:15.918
Gosh, it's been a minute.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.352
- There you go.
- Ooh.

32:17.419 --> 32:19.354
I was taught to be
firm but gentle.

32:19.487 --> 32:22.157
Oh, and what about
the bread?

32:24.225 --> 32:25.861
- So.
- Right, the flour.

32:25.995 --> 32:26.829
Use the palm of your hands.

32:26.896 --> 32:27.863
Okay.

32:27.997 --> 32:28.831
Just massage it like that.

32:28.898 --> 32:29.865
Right.

32:29.932 --> 32:30.866
There you go.

32:31.000 --> 32:31.934
When do I
get to throw it?

32:32.034 --> 32:32.935
- You can throw it right now.
- Really?

32:33.035 --> 32:34.837
Whatever it feels right. Yeah.
Just.

32:34.904 --> 32:36.005
There it is.

32:39.541 --> 32:40.575
Appreciate that.
You have... you have a little...

32:40.710 --> 32:42.611
just right... right here.
Just like... there you go.

32:42.712 --> 32:43.578
There you go. Just.

32:49.051 --> 32:49.752
- Sorry.
- I deserved that.

32:49.826 --> 32:51.107
No, I deserved that.
That's... That's...

32:51.186 --> 32:52.621
I deserved that.

33:04.132 --> 33:05.600
That guy's waving at you.

33:05.735 --> 33:08.070
Ugh. Ignore him.

33:08.136 --> 33:09.939
Don't worry about him.

33:10.072 --> 33:11.907
You got some flour on your face.

33:13.141 --> 33:15.410
And something in your hair.

33:15.477 --> 33:16.544
I'm assuming it's flour

33:16.611 --> 33:18.413
and that you haven't
picked up some nasty

33:18.480 --> 33:20.415
Hollywood cocaine habit.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.552
Maybe I should.

33:24.619 --> 33:28.390
At least I'd get
my lying, cheating,

33:28.456 --> 33:30.425
cradle-robbing bastard,

33:30.558 --> 33:33.261
so obviously,
midlife-crisis-laughingstock

33:33.395 --> 33:34.997
of a husband's attention.

33:37.632 --> 33:39.935
Nope, we're not gonna
go down that route.

33:40.069 --> 33:40.970
You hear me?

33:42.104 --> 33:43.773
We'll have none of that.

33:43.839 --> 33:47.175
I'm gonna go
off the rails

33:47.275 --> 33:49.577
and become a mess
so I can win him back.

33:49.644 --> 33:50.780
Nonsense.

33:52.647 --> 33:56.584
No. We're gonna go
quite the contrary.

33:56.651 --> 33:58.788
We're gonna go stronger
without him.

34:00.188 --> 34:01.356
You understand?

34:02.658 --> 34:04.325
I just don't know
if I can.

34:05.828 --> 34:06.962
Of course you can.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.431
Look at me.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.134
I didn't even have
my own bank account

34:12.266 --> 34:14.302
when Jack left me.

34:14.369 --> 34:16.038
I didn't even know how to drive.

34:17.371 --> 34:20.507
And now. look at me now.

34:21.509 --> 34:24.612
Huh? Now I know what it's like

34:24.679 --> 34:27.183
to have created
something of my own.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.452
And, you know,
that is so satisfying.

34:30.518 --> 34:32.688
And so liberating.

34:32.822 --> 34:36.491
I know I need to pick
myself up and dust myself off.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.829
And I will, you know.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.998
In time. It's just...

34:44.800 --> 34:47.235
I'm just hurting so much,
FeeFee.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.971
I know.

34:49.038 --> 34:50.472
I'm just really hurting.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.810
I know. I'm sorry.

34:59.682 --> 35:00.648
Look.

35:02.184 --> 35:05.553
Look at that view, Mags.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.522
And tell me the world

35:07.656 --> 35:11.727
is not a wondrous place
and life worth living.

35:13.863 --> 35:15.430
Truly.

35:21.237 --> 35:22.370
Hm.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.941
- Mm?
- Oh.

35:27.342 --> 35:28.844
Your drinks.

35:28.911 --> 35:30.045
Thank you.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.717
Well, that is what
your dad would call ambrosial.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.520
- Right!
- Uh-huh.

35:38.586 --> 35:40.122
I'd forgotten about that.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.859
So what's in it
other than rum and an umbrella?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.129
It goes like this.

35:47.229 --> 35:53.736
One of sour, two of sweet,
three of strong, four of weak.

35:56.739 --> 35:57.807
Okay.

35:59.809 --> 36:04.713
Okay. Dark rum,
passionfruit, lemon,

36:04.780 --> 36:08.550
secret ingredient, soda,
angostura bitter,

36:08.616 --> 36:11.120
and nutmeg.

36:12.755 --> 36:15.724
Well, I demand to know
what the secret ingredient is.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.795
Oh, come on.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.264
It wouldn't
be secret otherwise.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.934
And it's the nutmeg
that matters.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.269
Oh, really? Why?

36:27.335 --> 36:29.637
'Cause it's an aphrodisiac.

36:29.772 --> 36:32.141
Oh, well, excuse me.

36:32.274 --> 36:35.845
Look at you
and your aphrodisiacs.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.112
What are you hiding?

36:38.848 --> 36:39.815
Nothing.

36:39.949 --> 36:42.517
- Uh, nothing?
- Yeah, nothing.

36:45.353 --> 36:47.122
You have a man,
don't you?

36:48.623 --> 36:49.792
I know you much too well.

36:49.925 --> 36:51.760
It was the guy
in the fishing boat, wasn't it?

36:51.827 --> 36:53.762
The one who was waving at you.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.299
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.969
Oh, come on. Tell me.

37:02.604 --> 37:03.504
Tell me.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.144
Oh, it's kinda nice.

37:09.278 --> 37:10.179
- Oh?
- Yeah.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.146
Of course you would say that.

37:13.048 --> 37:15.718
I forgot
how good you are at netball.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.552
What?
Do you want another?

37:17.653 --> 37:20.622
No,
I think this is enough.

37:20.689 --> 37:22.324
Let that melt right here, okay?

37:22.390 --> 37:24.693
Hm, hm, hm.
Are you gonna tell me now?

37:24.827 --> 37:27.562
Are you gonna
tell me what his name is?

37:27.663 --> 37:29.564
Do you want another one?

37:29.665 --> 37:31.000
- Are you done?
- Don't change the sub...

37:31.066 --> 37:32.167
don't change the subject.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.380
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

39:58.480 --> 39:59.515
I'm good. How are you?

39:59.647 --> 40:02.117
Look at this.

40:02.184 --> 40:05.120
And did you...
do you make this?

40:05.187 --> 40:06.554
You always...

40:06.655 --> 40:08.891
she's always trying
to get the aphrodisiac.

40:12.627 --> 40:13.529
What do you think?

40:13.662 --> 40:15.164
Do you think it fits?

40:15.297 --> 40:16.498
Hmm. Too big?

40:16.631 --> 40:17.733
Yeah.

40:20.302 --> 40:21.670
What about this?

40:23.972 --> 40:26.675
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

40:27.676 --> 40:29.678
Oh, look, we'll go
diving for these, okay?

40:29.812 --> 40:31.180
- Yes. They're amazing.
- Um-hmm.

40:31.313 --> 40:32.381
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.716
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

40:34.850 --> 40:35.918
- Um.
- Uh, I...

40:36.018 --> 40:37.186
I'm just
shopping for dinner.

40:37.252 --> 40:38.320
- Did you find anything?
- Oh, of course.

40:38.387 --> 40:39.221
Uh, I found this hat.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.422
- Oh, it suits you.
- What do you think?

40:40.522 --> 40:42.524
- I like that.
- Thank you.

40:42.658 --> 40:43.759
Where you off to next?

40:43.859 --> 40:45.027
You... you wanna join me?

40:45.094 --> 40:47.696
Sure. I mean,
that would be great.

40:49.665 --> 40:51.433
You're gonna love this.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.102
Hi, Sylvia. How are you?

40:53.202 --> 40:56.371
Look at these.
Wow. tilapia, red snapper.

40:56.505 --> 40:57.706
Beautiful. Yum.

40:57.773 --> 40:59.241
Singing fish?

40:59.374 --> 41:00.843
Singing.

41:00.909 --> 41:02.945
Uh, both of these, please.

41:03.045 --> 41:04.012
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

41:04.079 --> 41:05.881
I'm just gonna grab something.

41:06.014 --> 41:07.549
What kind of fish is this?

41:07.683 --> 41:08.684
This one's a snapper.

41:08.750 --> 41:11.753
Hey, it's Maggie.

41:11.887 --> 41:14.056
Maggie, Maggie.
Can we get a selfie, please?

41:14.123 --> 41:14.890
Uh, you know.

41:14.957 --> 41:16.592
Please.
Just... just one.

41:16.725 --> 41:17.893
- Just one, please.
- Um. Fine.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.561
Darlin', I'm so sorry.
I thought I lost you.

41:19.627 --> 41:20.562
Sorry.

41:20.628 --> 41:21.797
Let's go. Come on.

41:21.897 --> 41:23.065
I don't know
how you put up with that.

41:23.132 --> 41:24.199
That's nothing.

41:24.266 --> 41:25.267
Von.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.368
- Hey.
- How are you, man?

41:26.435 --> 41:27.903
- Uh, the usual, please.
- Sure.

41:28.036 --> 41:29.538
What's...
what's the usual?

41:29.605 --> 41:32.774
Um.
you're gonna love these.

41:32.908 --> 41:36.311
Oh, my God, what is this?

41:36.411 --> 41:37.913
- Try it.
- Okay.

41:37.980 --> 41:40.582
- Oooh, it's hot.
- Yeah. Just blow on it.

41:40.716 --> 41:41.984
Oh, so fresh.

41:43.252 --> 41:44.219
Mm.

41:45.754 --> 41:47.256
- You're terrible.
- I thought you might like it.

41:47.389 --> 41:48.991
- I might have to have another.
- You can have another.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.159
- You want some?
- Uh, yup.

41:51.126 --> 41:53.328
Ah, it's really,
it's really hot.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.296
It's really hot.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.430
- You weren't kiddin'.
- Yeah.

41:55.497 --> 41:57.499
Oh, my goodness.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.334
- But delicious, right?
- Amazing.

42:08.310 --> 42:09.311
Oh, I feel terrible.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.946
Oh, yeah. That might be
a little too much

42:11.013 --> 42:12.147
of a good thing, I think.

42:17.119 --> 42:20.189
Thank you.

42:24.159 --> 42:25.662
Sam, don't you
want to sit in the front?

42:25.794 --> 42:27.629
- There's more leg room.
- No, no. I'm okay.

42:27.696 --> 42:29.131
I feel safer back here.

42:30.866 --> 42:32.034
Cheek.

42:33.268 --> 42:35.971
So, what's
for dinner tonight?

42:36.038 --> 42:37.539
Uh, it's a surprise.

42:37.639 --> 42:38.974
Ugh, I hate surprises.

42:39.107 --> 42:40.442
No, no.
You'll like this one.

42:43.845 --> 42:45.447
Hey, I was thinking.
What about dinner,

42:45.514 --> 42:46.982
just you and me together
tonight?

42:47.049 --> 42:48.450
I would love that.

42:48.517 --> 42:49.318
Well, in that case,

42:53.622 --> 42:54.990
I'd love that too.

42:58.527 --> 42:59.828
Here we go. Hold on.

42:59.962 --> 43:02.998
Okay, man. Chill.

43:45.107 --> 43:46.408
What am I doing?

43:57.687 --> 43:58.887
Good evening, chef.

43:58.954 --> 44:00.389
Oh, hi there.

44:12.769 --> 44:14.636
Knock, knock.

44:14.737 --> 44:16.204
Oh. Wow.

44:18.407 --> 44:20.042
You dressed up.

44:20.108 --> 44:23.746
This old thing?

44:23.812 --> 44:24.747
If you say so.

44:30.118 --> 44:31.586
These are some of my people.

44:31.654 --> 44:32.755
Yeah.

44:32.888 --> 44:35.090
That's from
your parents' wedding.

44:35.223 --> 44:37.225
I haven't seen
this one before.

44:39.594 --> 44:40.996
Are you hungry?

44:44.599 --> 44:45.600
Here we go.

44:45.735 --> 44:46.769
Thank you.

44:46.835 --> 44:48.603
And cheers.

44:48.738 --> 44:50.072
Cheers.

44:53.442 --> 44:55.243
Ooh.
It's got a kick to it.

44:56.845 --> 44:58.613
Can barely feel my toes.

44:58.681 --> 45:00.282
Okay.

45:02.785 --> 45:05.954
It's the juice
from a habanero chili.

45:06.088 --> 45:07.622
Sam thinks nobody knows.

45:08.825 --> 45:10.525
But we all do,
so don't tell him.

45:10.625 --> 45:11.426
Here he comes.

45:11.493 --> 45:13.161
All right,
I hope you're hungry.

45:13.295 --> 45:14.596
I could eat a horse.

45:14.664 --> 45:16.298
Local operatic fish,

45:16.365 --> 45:19.334
line-caught this morning,
grilled over wild herbs,

45:19.468 --> 45:22.304
and tossed with ransoms
and cilantro from the garden,

45:22.371 --> 45:24.005
and dressed with
a vanilla-infused,

45:24.139 --> 45:27.209
locally sourced olive oil
from the bucida spinoza olives

45:27.309 --> 45:29.444
that are native
to these islands.

45:29.511 --> 45:31.313
The, uh, fish comes from
where we were this morning.

45:31.380 --> 45:32.381
- Yeah.
- Out in the water,

45:32.481 --> 45:34.549
past the rocks
and just to the left.

45:34.649 --> 45:35.818
So, the fish from the market.

45:35.951 --> 45:36.885
That's right.

45:36.985 --> 45:38.654
Oh, my singing fish.

45:38.721 --> 45:40.155
They're still
happy to see you.

45:40.222 --> 45:41.189
And they'll taste sweet

45:41.323 --> 45:43.492
because they're local
and they're fresh.

45:43.558 --> 45:46.662
And, um. I haven't done
anything to them so they can

45:46.729 --> 45:49.799
speak and sing
for themselves.

45:49.866 --> 45:51.667
Thank you.
It looks wonderful.

45:53.168 --> 45:55.671
Uh. Can I get you
anything else?

45:55.738 --> 45:59.307
No. So can you please go
so we can talk about you.

45:59.374 --> 46:00.308
Enjoy.

46:00.375 --> 46:02.210
Thank you.

46:03.178 --> 46:05.981
He's lovely, isn't he?

46:06.047 --> 46:07.750
He is, yeah.

46:07.850 --> 46:09.685
I do worry about him, though.

46:09.819 --> 46:11.586
Why?

46:11.687 --> 46:13.321
I think he gets lonely.

46:13.388 --> 46:15.858
And raising Daniel
all by himself.

46:15.991 --> 46:17.559
Who's Daniel?

46:17.693 --> 46:19.060
Daniel is his son.

46:20.897 --> 46:24.767
Oh. How old?

46:24.867 --> 46:30.005
Three? No, four. Four.

46:30.071 --> 46:32.474
And does Daniel have a mom?

46:32.574 --> 46:36.378
She left them.
She went to the States.

46:36.511 --> 46:41.550
Nobody knows where.
And just never came back.

46:41.684 --> 46:45.587
God, that's terrible.
It must've been so hard.

46:48.557 --> 46:52.594
Makes me think that
you two have stuff in common.

46:56.631 --> 46:59.301
Why? Because we've both been
abandoned?

46:59.401 --> 47:04.707
Well, it's more like
you're both lonely people.

47:04.774 --> 47:07.944
I'm not lonely. I
mean.

47:08.076 --> 47:11.413
I just see
two wonderful people

47:11.480 --> 47:15.718
who've made a genuine
connection.

47:15.785 --> 47:17.285
Please.

47:19.655 --> 47:20.489
It's probably his thing.

47:20.589 --> 47:23.759
You know, all these
lonely, sad women

47:23.826 --> 47:26.929
who come on holiday
and in comes gorgeous Sam

47:26.995 --> 47:27.964
with his rum punch

47:28.096 --> 47:31.767
and just sweeps them
off their feet.

47:31.901 --> 47:33.435
He's just not that guy.

47:37.606 --> 47:41.009
Oh, well, well, well.
Hello there.

47:41.109 --> 47:46.114
Maggie, this is Victor.
My lawyer and my friend.

47:46.181 --> 47:47.449
I didn't know
you had company.

47:47.582 --> 47:51.286
I told you
my cousin was coming to stay.

47:51.419 --> 47:53.288
And you were waving at us
the other day.

47:53.355 --> 47:55.624
- Yes.
- And you ignored me.

47:55.691 --> 47:58.159
I've been phoning you,
left numerous messages,

47:58.293 --> 48:01.296
all ignored.
I sent you flowers.

48:01.363 --> 48:03.699
Don't be needy.
It's not like you at all.

48:03.799 --> 48:06.635
Come on, have a seat. Join us.

48:06.769 --> 48:07.536
As you can see,

48:10.806 --> 48:12.440
Five.

48:12.507 --> 48:13.341
The what?

48:16.846 --> 48:19.481
I was beginning to think that
this cousin of hers was a guy.

48:19.548 --> 48:22.718
And I was going to
have to get jealous.

48:22.818 --> 48:25.320
No, I'm a girl.

48:25.387 --> 48:27.823
Maggie. Nice to meet you.

48:27.957 --> 48:29.558
Hello, Maggie.

48:29.659 --> 48:33.361
And I am a ridiculously
famous movie star

48:33.495 --> 48:35.463
whose life is falling apart.

48:35.530 --> 48:37.499
And the only way
to get better

48:37.566 --> 48:41.536
is to come here
and be with my fabulous,

48:41.671 --> 48:44.674
wonderful cousin
and closest friend

48:44.740 --> 48:47.677
on this idyllic island.

48:47.810 --> 48:49.210
I see.

48:49.344 --> 48:51.847
Do you like to join us
for some singing fish?

48:53.315 --> 48:55.550
Maggie, I like you already

48:55.685 --> 48:57.385
and yes, I will have
some of that singing fish.

48:57.519 --> 48:59.021
Here.

48:59.087 --> 49:00.522
Great.

49:00.589 --> 49:04.927
Then we can talk about
your friendship with my cousin.

49:05.027 --> 49:06.361
I'd love that.

49:08.864 --> 49:10.165
Do you have an accent,
by the way?

49:10.231 --> 49:11.199
Where are you from?

49:11.333 --> 49:13.602
Saint Martin.
French Caribbean.

49:13.703 --> 49:15.037
Oo-la-la.

49:18.206 --> 49:19.775
I mean, we nearly
ran out of fish.

49:19.875 --> 49:21.409
I know.

49:21.543 --> 49:24.446
And then this is what Jessica
was asking for, the mahi-mahi.

49:24.546 --> 49:25.580
- Again.
- Again.

49:28.884 --> 49:30.251
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:30.385 --> 49:33.221
Where are you two off to
all cloak-and-dagger?

49:33.355 --> 49:35.190
We're, uh, we're
going night-crabbing.

49:35.256 --> 49:36.391
- Oh.
- Wanna come?

49:36.458 --> 49:38.226
Is that like
nightclubbing, but not?

49:38.360 --> 49:39.260
I told you
she has sense of humor.

49:39.394 --> 49:40.195
You were so right.

49:41.363 --> 49:42.297
How big are the crabs?

49:42.397 --> 49:44.466
Well, like. like this.
Not... not...

49:44.566 --> 49:47.803
Oh. You know what?
Good night, boys. Have fun.

49:47.903 --> 49:49.437
No

50:04.954 --> 50:05.988
Me?

50:08.924 --> 50:09.925
Good night, Sam.

50:13.996 --> 50:14.997
Good night.

52:29.464 --> 52:31.399
- Stop.
- What?

52:31.466 --> 52:33.468
You keep looking at me.

52:33.568 --> 52:35.403
You keep being there.

52:35.470 --> 52:36.772
You're such a flirt.

52:37.740 --> 52:40.242
As promised.
fresh rolls.

52:40.308 --> 52:41.744
- Hot.
- Oh my God. You're a genius.

52:41.811 --> 52:42.745
Look at those.

52:42.878 --> 52:43.913
Oh my God, Sam.

52:43.979 --> 52:45.413
Mm.

52:45.480 --> 52:46.581
Good morning.

52:46.715 --> 52:47.817
- Morning.
- Hi.

52:49.584 --> 52:51.153
A little boy
dropped these off.

52:51.253 --> 52:53.656
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

52:55.257 --> 52:57.993
Uh, I... I just might. Yes.

52:58.093 --> 52:59.594
He's adorable.

52:59.662 --> 53:02.430
The apple does fall
far from the tree.

53:02.497 --> 53:03.966
Oh, you do have
a sense of humor.

53:05.301 --> 53:06.969
May I get you
a cup of coffee?

53:07.102 --> 53:08.003
Sure.

53:09.504 --> 53:11.439
Sit down.

53:16.511 --> 53:18.013
Victor.

53:19.315 --> 53:20.448
All right.

53:21.349 --> 53:23.618
- I must be going.
- Oh, okay.

53:23.686 --> 53:24.920
I've gotta go home and change.

53:24.987 --> 53:25.955
Yeah.

53:29.959 --> 53:31.660
And drop the keys
to the farm.

53:31.794 --> 53:33.361
Oh, is that
the house on the hill?

53:33.461 --> 53:34.596
The one for sale?

53:34.663 --> 53:37.166
It is. Why?
Are you interested?

53:37.299 --> 53:39.335
Victor.
I'll find you later.

53:39.467 --> 53:40.602
Okay?

53:40.669 --> 53:42.204
I'm stealing her away
for the day.

53:42.304 --> 53:43.939
But she's a willing hostage.

53:44.006 --> 53:47.042
Huh, a touch
of Stockholm syndrome?

53:47.142 --> 53:49.111
Something like that.

53:49.178 --> 53:50.212
I'm... I'm sorry.

53:50.312 --> 53:51.546
I really... I'm sorry.

53:51.646 --> 53:52.647
I thought
we were climbing

53:52.781 --> 53:55.284
to the top of that mountain
today.

53:55.351 --> 53:57.186
I have
some making up to do.

53:57.319 --> 53:59.487
You understand, right?

53:59.554 --> 54:02.024
You gonna be okay by yourself?

54:02.157 --> 54:02.958
Yeah, I'll be fine.

54:08.664 --> 54:12.034
Uh, you could.
you could always come with me.

54:12.167 --> 54:15.237
I have to head up to the
vegetable garden this afternoon.

54:15.337 --> 54:16.672
Could always use
an undergardener.

54:16.739 --> 54:19.341
A... a what?
An... an undergardener?

54:23.645 --> 54:27.082
I... I mean,
how could I resist?

54:27.182 --> 54:28.083
Great.

54:32.354 --> 54:36.759
So how serious are
things between you and Victor?

54:36.859 --> 54:40.696
He's a good guy, Mags.
And they're hard to find.

54:40.763 --> 54:45.533
So when you do find them,
you have to hold on to them.

54:45.668 --> 54:49.405
I will probably not
be back tonight.

54:49.537 --> 54:52.942
So don't worry.
I'm in excellent hands.

54:53.075 --> 54:55.844
You are terrible.

54:55.911 --> 54:59.748
I'm happy, Mags.
And I'm alive.

54:59.882 --> 55:00.916
And I don't want to
hear anything

55:01.050 --> 55:03.052
about any garden-related
accidents.

55:03.185 --> 55:04.053
You understand?

55:04.186 --> 55:05.254
Oh, please.

55:06.722 --> 55:07.588
Hi.

55:07.723 --> 55:09.590
Hello, Victor.

55:09.725 --> 55:11.961
Madam.

55:15.463 --> 55:16.398
Have fun.

55:17.465 --> 55:19.101
You know we will.

55:28.310 --> 55:31.113
I, uh, hope you're ready
for a hard day's work.

55:33.415 --> 55:34.649
Yeah.

56:21.430 --> 56:22.364
Wow.

56:23.932 --> 56:25.801
Yeah, it's fertile here.

56:25.868 --> 56:27.970
More fertile than
my patch at Golden Rock.

56:28.037 --> 56:31.606
Victor negotiated the rental
on this plot for Fiona.

56:38.646 --> 56:39.815
And this house is for sale?

56:41.050 --> 56:44.119
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh,
it's been empty for ages.

56:46.455 --> 56:47.656
Let me get the tools.

57:37.940 --> 57:39.508
Oh.

57:39.575 --> 57:41.710
My, uh, home
away from home.

57:41.777 --> 57:43.545
It's wonderful.

57:43.611 --> 57:45.080
It's great, isn't it?

59:30.819 --> 59:31.987
Here.

59:32.120 --> 59:33.355
- What is it?
- Have a smell.

59:38.493 --> 59:41.530
Oh. vanilla.

59:41.664 --> 59:43.966
Vanilla pompona,
to be exact.

59:44.032 --> 59:45.702
Also known as
West Indian vanilla.

59:45.834 --> 59:47.670
It's a... it's a type of orchid.

59:49.004 --> 59:50.138
The Aztecs cultivated it

59:50.205 --> 59:51.506
and the conquistadors
called it vanilla,

59:51.640 --> 59:54.711
which means "little pod."

59:54.843 --> 59:55.744
They took it
back to Europe

59:55.844 --> 59:58.046
at the same time
they introduced cacao.

59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.917
It's hugely labor-intensive,
which is why it's so precious.

01:00:02.017 --> 01:00:03.185
You have to
pollinate it by hand

01:00:03.252 --> 01:00:05.053
in a method discovered
by a 12-year-old slave

01:00:05.187 --> 01:00:07.189
named Albius
in the 19th century.

01:00:07.256 --> 01:00:10.359
And, uh, it's
not just used in flavoring.

01:00:10.425 --> 01:00:13.428
It's also in cosmetics
and perfumes,

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:15.330
and it's in medicine.
Not just homeopathic medicine,

01:00:15.397 --> 01:00:18.367
it's... has antiseptic
properties.

01:00:18.433 --> 01:00:19.901
It's antispasmodic.

01:00:20.035 --> 01:00:21.203
Helps you sleep,
wakes you up.

01:00:23.171 --> 01:00:25.274
Its scent tricks you
into thinking

01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:27.542
you've eaten chocolate
and makes you happy.

01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:31.380
That's why
you're always smiling.

01:00:31.446 --> 01:00:35.550
Probably.

01:00:35.685 --> 01:00:36.551
You really love it.

01:00:38.453 --> 01:00:39.521
Yeah, I really do.

01:00:43.693 --> 01:00:46.361
There's
something you're not telling me.

01:00:48.096 --> 01:00:49.898
Am I really
that transparent?

01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:52.434
Just tell me.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:55.537
Okay. And I haven't
told anybody this.

01:00:55.604 --> 01:00:56.638
One day.

01:00:58.708 --> 01:01:01.243
I'm gonna open a vanilla farm
right here on the island.

01:01:01.376 --> 01:01:03.578
I mean, it's perfectly
suited to it.

01:01:03.645 --> 01:01:06.048
It's the right loamy soil,
the sun, a little bit of shade,

01:01:06.114 --> 01:01:10.085
the slope,
it's... it's perfect.

01:01:10.152 --> 01:01:11.788
It's crazy, right?
That sounds crazy.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.090
No, it sounds wonderful.

01:01:15.157 --> 01:01:16.291
You should do it.
Absolutely.

01:01:16.425 --> 01:01:19.161
I mean,
it's your passion, Sam.

01:01:19.261 --> 01:01:22.631
I mean, we should always do
what we're passionate about.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.134
Well, there is one...

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:29.438
one other thing
that I'm passionate about.

01:01:45.287 --> 01:01:47.456
You never told me
you could sail.

01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:48.758
You never asked.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.361
Ugh. I love it.

01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:53.796
I always forget
it's my happy place

01:01:53.929 --> 01:01:55.097
until I'm in it.

01:01:57.966 --> 01:01:59.968
Tighten up the sheet, Skipper.

01:02:00.035 --> 01:02:02.537
Aye-aye, Captain.

01:02:34.202 --> 01:02:35.904
<i>â™ª Lord knows Lord knows</i>

01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:04.687
This reminds me
of high school.

01:05:09.825 --> 01:05:12.327
Where's Daniel tonight?

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.896
He's, uh,
he's at a sleepover.

01:05:16.331 --> 01:05:18.166
Oh, so you
planned this, huh?

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:21.037
You know, "planned"
sounds kinda creepy.

01:05:22.304 --> 01:05:24.006
Uh, but...
but hoped, definitely.

01:05:24.072 --> 01:05:25.841
Yeah, definitely hoped.

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:16.892
- That was wonderful.
- Yeah.

01:06:16.959 --> 01:06:17.893
It was perfect.

01:06:19.127 --> 01:06:20.462
It was perfect.

01:06:26.902 --> 01:06:28.403
Um, I.

01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:30.706
have to go to work.

01:06:31.874 --> 01:06:32.775
I know.

01:06:34.342 --> 01:06:36.045
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:06:36.112 --> 01:06:37.079
Thank you.

01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:10.746
Did you sleep well,
Margaret?

01:07:10.813 --> 01:07:13.816
Oh, wonderfully, Fiona.

01:07:13.949 --> 01:07:16.952
It must have been
a nice sleep-in, yeah?

01:07:17.086 --> 01:07:18.486
Lazy morning in bed?

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:21.256
Oh, yes, it was bliss.

01:07:21.322 --> 01:07:23.125
Yeah.

01:07:23.258 --> 01:07:25.326
Uh-huh.

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.962
No disturbances?

01:07:27.096 --> 01:07:28.296
No, none.

01:07:29.865 --> 01:07:31.533
So how come I've been
banging on your door

01:07:31.633 --> 01:07:33.334
for the past two hours?

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:36.438
One hour.

01:07:36.504 --> 01:07:37.639
Fine, 10 minutes.

01:07:37.773 --> 01:07:42.111
I guess
I'm just a sound sleeper.

01:07:42.178 --> 01:07:44.113
Uh-huh. Slut.

01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:50.452
Okay, come on.
I want all the details.

01:07:50.518 --> 01:07:52.655
No.
There's nothing to tell.

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:55.725
Okay.

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:57.993
Well, I'm gonna take you
on a walk then.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.327
Nice try.

01:07:59.394 --> 01:08:01.329
I'm not talking.

01:08:01.396 --> 01:08:02.665
You'll talk.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.868
Now you know
what it feels like.

01:09:26.148 --> 01:09:27.149
God, the beauty
of this island,

01:09:27.249 --> 01:09:30.417
it just hits you
again and again.

01:09:33.956 --> 01:09:36.759
Are you feeling better?
You sound better.

01:09:40.095 --> 01:09:40.996
Yeah, I am.

01:09:43.933 --> 01:09:45.600
It's the island
doing its work.

01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:51.273
And maybe Sam has
a little to do with it.

01:09:51.406 --> 01:09:52.841
Yes, he does.

01:09:52.942 --> 01:09:55.110
- Uh-huh.
- And you.

01:09:55.244 --> 01:09:56.812
And Nevis.

01:09:56.946 --> 01:10:02.952
Oh, I just feel like I'm finally
finding myself, you know?

01:10:03.085 --> 01:10:03.986
Um-hmm.

01:10:04.954 --> 01:10:07.289
I feel like
I could stay here.

01:10:07.422 --> 01:10:08.691
Maybe even live here.

01:10:12.294 --> 01:10:16.165
So.
what's stopping you?

01:10:16.298 --> 01:10:18.466
Work.

01:10:18.533 --> 01:10:21.136
Living here
wouldn't stop that.

01:10:21.203 --> 01:10:21.971
No, I guess you're right.

01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:27.977
and keep this as a home base.

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:31.280
Would you miss London?

01:10:31.347 --> 01:10:33.816
No, not at all.

01:10:33.949 --> 01:10:34.683
Deep down inside,

01:10:37.152 --> 01:10:38.888
Just never had the time to go.

01:10:42.557 --> 01:10:44.326
Do you miss Christopher?

01:10:44.459 --> 01:10:45.661
You know,
when I first got here,

01:10:45.728 --> 01:10:50.398
I felt that panicky feeling of,
how am I ever gonna cope?

01:10:50.498 --> 01:10:52.134
Um-hmm.

01:10:52.201 --> 01:10:53.235
That's gone now.

01:10:54.703 --> 01:10:56.672
And I feel so much stronger.

01:10:58.406 --> 01:11:00.508
All thanks to you.

01:11:00.575 --> 01:11:03.511
It's such a joy
having you here.

01:11:03.645 --> 01:11:04.980
I wish you could
stay here forever.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:10.352
I love you, Fee.

01:11:10.485 --> 01:11:12.721
And I love you.

01:11:12.855 --> 01:11:15.724
Right. So. this afternoon,

01:11:15.858 --> 01:11:20.162
I was thinking we'd go
and do some shopping therapy.

01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:25.067
Actually, I've already
made plans with Sam and Daniel.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.236
Tomorrow?

01:11:27.369 --> 01:11:30.005
Of course.
As long as you're happy.

01:11:30.072 --> 01:11:32.207
That's all I care about.

01:11:32.274 --> 01:11:35.576
I am, Fiona.
I'm really happy.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.883
Okay, I want to welcome
you to the Swim Academy.

01:11:41.016 --> 01:11:42.885
And children,
it's very important

01:11:43.018 --> 01:11:44.853
that you listen to
the instructors, okay?

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.587
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:11:46.722 --> 01:11:48.257
Everybody ready
to have some fun?

01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:49.291
Me!

01:11:49.391 --> 01:11:51.026
Okay! Let's go!

01:11:55.698 --> 01:11:58.400
Hey, kiddo, it's okay.

01:11:58.533 --> 01:12:01.536
I was nervous
the first time too.

01:12:01.602 --> 01:12:03.405
But you know Terry's there
and the parents,

01:12:03.471 --> 01:12:05.140
and your dad and me.
we're all here.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.241
You're gonna be safe.

01:12:06.308 --> 01:12:09.244
It really is.
Hey, I know you...

01:12:09.311 --> 01:12:10.913
I know you're worried about
getting splashed in the face.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.580
But you splash me
all the time, right?

01:12:12.647 --> 01:12:14.917
All the time.
Are you ready?

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.918
Are you ready?

01:12:16.051 --> 01:12:17.086
Do you want one of us
to take you down?

01:12:19.655 --> 01:12:20.756
Do you wanna go
with Maggie?

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:23.826
Come on, come on.
Be brave.

01:12:23.926 --> 01:12:25.160
Oh!

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.628
Oh, I see.
I see how it is.

01:12:27.763 --> 01:12:30.766
Oh, all right.
Let's do it.

01:12:30.899 --> 01:12:32.801
All right,
have fun, big guy.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.848
What about that?

01:12:45.948 --> 01:12:49.284
Any... any day
that I'm not gonna.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:51.987
You want to
bury your feet?

01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:53.122
You want to bury
one of my feet?

01:12:56.624 --> 01:12:57.592
Thank you.

01:12:57.659 --> 01:12:59.194
Oh, my goodness!

01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:02.765
Well now,
what am I gonna do?

01:13:02.831 --> 01:13:04.299
I've got no feet left.

01:13:04.433 --> 01:13:05.801
I'll bury yours too.

01:13:06.869 --> 01:13:08.337
We're gonna be feet monsters
when we come out.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:10.172
We'll be full of sand!

01:13:12.341 --> 01:13:13.641
That's silly, I know.

01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:15.543
But we'll go in the water
and we'll wash it all off.

01:13:15.643 --> 01:13:17.980
And it'll just disappear
into the ocean.

01:13:18.113 --> 01:13:20.315
And all the fishes
will wiggle in the sand.

01:13:20.449 --> 01:13:21.717
Ready to pull them out?

01:13:21.817 --> 01:13:23.886
One, two, three.

01:13:23.986 --> 01:13:24.853
Oh!

01:13:24.987 --> 01:13:26.655
Look at all that sand.

01:13:26.722 --> 01:13:28.524
It's all over the place.

01:13:28.657 --> 01:13:31.126
Now, can I have
my hat back, Mister?

01:13:31.193 --> 01:13:32.127
Yeah.

01:13:32.194 --> 01:13:33.829
Thank you.

01:13:33.962 --> 01:13:35.964
All right.
You ready for this?

01:13:36.031 --> 01:13:37.166
You wanna get in the water?

01:13:37.232 --> 01:13:39.567
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.

01:14:10.099 --> 01:14:13.735
- Yay! Come on, boy.
- Yay!

01:14:13.869 --> 01:14:15.571
You did great.
High five.

01:14:15.704 --> 01:14:17.439
- All right!
- Come on, come on.

01:14:17.539 --> 01:14:19.174
You're so strong.

01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:20.876
Nice grip.

01:14:24.446 --> 01:14:25.547
- Yay!
- Come on, let's go

01:14:25.681 --> 01:14:26.882
hop back in the car.

01:14:27.015 --> 01:14:28.050
Okay. Go, go, go.

01:14:34.022 --> 01:14:35.224
You are brilliant
with him, you know.

01:14:37.059 --> 01:14:39.394
Well, he's a good kid.

01:14:39.528 --> 01:14:42.865
I know. I'm lucky.

01:14:42.931 --> 01:14:47.436
With his mother leaving,
it's hard on a little kid.

01:14:47.569 --> 01:14:50.305
He asks about her sometimes.

01:14:50.405 --> 01:14:52.741
You haven't
talked about it?

01:14:52.808 --> 01:14:56.044
She...
she was a mess.

01:14:56.111 --> 01:14:57.546
I hoped she would stop
being a mess.

01:14:57.613 --> 01:14:59.915
But she didn't.

01:15:03.752 --> 01:15:05.254
and then she left.

01:15:09.224 --> 01:15:11.126
That must have been
devastating.

01:15:13.428 --> 01:15:14.429
I should've seen it comin'.

01:15:16.231 --> 01:15:19.434
The thing is.
she left me Daniel.

01:15:20.936 --> 01:15:22.604
And I see it as a privilege
that I get to raise him,

01:15:22.738 --> 01:15:23.805
spend so much time with him.

01:15:23.939 --> 01:15:26.675
Because a lot of dads
don't get to do that, so.

01:15:26.775 --> 01:15:28.577
So yeah.

01:15:28.644 --> 01:15:30.145
I think I'm the one
that's lucky.

01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:34.783
I think Daniel's
pretty lucky too.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.762
Come here, big guy.
Come here.

01:15:51.633 --> 01:15:54.269
You were great today.

01:15:54.336 --> 01:15:56.171
Hey, I'll meet you up
in the kitchen, pal.

01:15:56.305 --> 01:15:57.472
Bye, Maggie.

01:15:57.606 --> 01:15:58.874
Bye.

01:15:58.974 --> 01:16:01.210
Oh, my gosh,
how was he not exhausted?

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:02.211
I am whupped.

01:16:02.311 --> 01:16:03.812
Yeah.

01:16:05.214 --> 01:16:10.352
Um, do you think that
we could see each other later?

01:16:12.854 --> 01:16:15.057
Yeah, I think.
I think we can make that happen.

01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:18.160
Oh.

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.034
Okay.

01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:39.982
Christopher.

01:16:41.516 --> 01:16:43.686
What are you doing here?

01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:45.420
How did you find me?

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.256
Wasn't hard to figure out.

01:16:47.356 --> 01:16:50.092
Fiona is the only person
you're ever gonna go to.

01:16:59.534 --> 01:17:00.402
I have a plane booked

01:17:00.535 --> 01:17:03.038
to take us back to London
tomorrow morning.

01:17:03.105 --> 01:17:04.873
You can't just
show up here like this.

01:17:05.007 --> 01:17:06.908
Maggie, we're married.

01:17:07.042 --> 01:17:09.211
Okay? You don't just walk away
from 10 years of marriage

01:17:09.278 --> 01:17:10.545
just because...

01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:14.717
I...

01:17:14.783 --> 01:17:18.954
I made a mistake.
And I'm so sorry.

01:17:21.523 --> 01:17:26.228
Please, let's just go home
and we can talk about it.

01:17:43.078 --> 01:17:44.913
What you doin'?

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.982
I'm leaving.

01:17:47.082 --> 01:17:48.984
I can see that.

01:17:50.052 --> 01:17:51.586
Christopher's here.

01:17:54.256 --> 01:17:56.091
He wants me to come home.

01:17:57.559 --> 01:17:58.593
So I'm going.

01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:00.929
Why?

01:18:02.732 --> 01:18:04.966
Because.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.235
I can't just leave everything
behind, you know?

01:18:08.837 --> 01:18:09.971
He's my husband.

01:18:11.473 --> 01:18:14.009
I can't just walk away
from that.

01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:16.945
At least without
talking about it.

01:18:19.514 --> 01:18:21.249
Can you trust him again?

01:18:29.358 --> 01:18:30.359
I don't know.

01:18:32.294 --> 01:18:36.498
Just know that
I'm right here for you.

01:18:36.631 --> 01:18:40.202
And, um, I love you.

01:18:43.505 --> 01:18:44.973
I love you too.

01:19:10.298 --> 01:19:11.466
- Maggie, I...
- No, wait.

01:19:11.533 --> 01:19:13.201
Let me speak, please.

01:19:13.335 --> 01:19:16.338
You're the most
extraordinary person

01:19:16.405 --> 01:19:19.408
I have ever met.

01:19:19.508 --> 01:19:24.045
And I was not expecting
to have all of these feelings.

01:19:26.047 --> 01:19:29.017
Which makes it
all the more complicated.

01:19:30.485 --> 01:19:38.026
'Cause I feel frightened
and conflicted and excited and...

01:19:38.093 --> 01:19:41.596
and angry and sad and happy
all at the same time.

01:19:44.399 --> 01:19:47.035
My head is... is...
is a complete mess.

01:19:50.172 --> 01:19:53.275
But I can't just walk away
from my old life.

01:19:55.243 --> 01:19:57.546
Our actions have consequences.

01:19:58.714 --> 01:20:01.216
And I have to go back
and talk to my husband.

01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:06.421
I know.
I understand that.

01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:14.730
I'm sorry that I wasn't
strong enough.

01:20:15.964 --> 01:20:18.099
to not complicate
your life even more.

01:20:19.601 --> 01:20:20.736
The fact is you made.

01:20:22.705 --> 01:20:27.075
you made me feel something
that I have never felt before.

01:20:36.985 --> 01:20:39.287
Give Daniel
a hug for me, okay?

01:21:09.785 --> 01:21:10.786
Are you sure?

01:21:12.287 --> 01:21:14.657
Look, even the island
doesn't want you to leave.

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:16.191
It's crying.

01:21:21.263 --> 01:21:23.265
I have to go, Fee.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.304
I'm gonna miss you.

01:21:33.041 --> 01:21:34.543
Me too.

01:21:38.146 --> 01:21:39.214
We're here, okay?

01:23:03.398 --> 01:23:04.700
Come on,
get out of the way, guys.

01:23:04.767 --> 01:23:05.901
Give the lady some room.

01:23:10.372 --> 01:23:13.241
Maggie, Maggie.
Have you got a comment?

01:23:13.308 --> 01:23:14.777
Maggie. Please, please, please.

01:23:17.412 --> 01:23:19.048
Get off my property!
Back off!

01:23:19.115 --> 01:23:20.548
Back off!

01:24:07.129 --> 01:24:08.698
Um, kettle just boiled.

01:24:08.798 --> 01:24:10.465
Um, do you want tea?

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.003
What are you having?

01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:15.503
Chamomile.

01:24:50.706 --> 01:24:53.475
Why'd you come back,
Christopher?

01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:57.012
No more lies,
no more excuses.

01:24:57.079 --> 01:24:58.379
Just the truth.

01:25:02.517 --> 01:25:04.220
When we spoke on the phone,

01:25:04.352 --> 01:25:06.989
everything was just crazy.
Okay?

01:25:07.056 --> 01:25:08.389
I was in the middle of a shoot,

01:25:08.523 --> 01:25:11.060
the whole Alexandra pregnancy
thing, it just.

01:25:14.196 --> 01:25:15.865
I made a mistake.

01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:18.533
But that's done now,
and I'm thinking clearly.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.736
And Maggie, I love you.

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.504
Okay? I don't want
to have a baby.

01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:24.840
What am I gonna do with a kid?

01:25:24.907 --> 01:25:27.408
I want this, us, the life
that we've created together,

01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:30.578
making films,
because it works.

01:25:30.713 --> 01:25:33.515
And you know, the Alex thing,
in a way I don't regret it

01:25:33.581 --> 01:25:37.253
because it made me realize
what we have is so special.

01:25:37.385 --> 01:25:39.054
I'm sorry,
let me get this straight.

01:25:40.689 --> 01:25:45.227
You run off with another woman,
who is now having your child,

01:25:45.293 --> 01:25:48.864
and you want us to pretend like
we can just go back to normal?

01:25:48.931 --> 01:25:52.600
Like I should be flattered
that it took all of this

01:25:52.735 --> 01:25:55.271
for you to realize
that what we had was special?

01:25:55.403 --> 01:25:56.304
Maggie...

01:25:56.404 --> 01:25:59.108
No, Christopher.

01:25:59.241 --> 01:26:00.976
This is done.

01:26:01.076 --> 01:26:02.745
Don't do this to us.

01:26:02.812 --> 01:26:05.748
To us?

01:26:05.815 --> 01:26:08.884
Where was "us" when
you were having an affair?

01:26:08.951 --> 01:26:11.754
There hasn't been an us
for as long as I can remember.

01:26:11.887 --> 01:26:13.656
There wasn't even an us
at our wedding.

01:26:13.756 --> 01:26:16.926
It has always been about you.

01:26:16.992 --> 01:26:20.763
And if I've learned anything
in the past few days,

01:26:20.896 --> 01:26:24.300
it's that I am stronger
without you.

01:26:24.432 --> 01:26:25.433
I don't want to be
the leading lady

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.436
in your story anymore.

01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:30.438
I'm gonna be the hero
in my own.

01:26:33.676 --> 01:26:35.443
So what are you saying?

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:37.179
I'm saying this is over.

01:26:38.848 --> 01:26:40.415
Our marriage
has reached its third act.

01:26:40.481 --> 01:26:42.151
And I'm not hanging around.

01:26:43.518 --> 01:26:44.954
Billy Wilder.

01:26:45.087 --> 01:26:46.322
Yeah.

01:26:46.454 --> 01:26:48.456
At least he knew
how to make a movie.

01:27:17.119 --> 01:27:18.787
Darling.

01:27:21.323 --> 01:27:22.291
Oh.

01:27:24.059 --> 01:27:26.527
Helen. Maggie!

01:27:26.662 --> 01:27:28.463
Aren't you a sight to behold.

01:27:28.529 --> 01:27:29.798
Why thank you.

01:27:29.865 --> 01:27:33.168
What can I get you? Chopped
salad, no dressing?

01:27:33.235 --> 01:27:36.471
No, I think I'll have
whatever is fresh and local.

01:27:36.537 --> 01:27:38.340
Let the chef decide.

01:27:38.406 --> 01:27:41.143
And a large glass
of Sancerre, please.

01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:42.845
I'll have the Merlot, darling.

01:27:42.912 --> 01:27:44.880
I'm gonna have to send
all my clients

01:27:45.014 --> 01:27:47.582
to the Caribbean on a jolly
if this is how they come back.

01:27:49.018 --> 01:27:50.753
Hmm. So?

01:27:50.853 --> 01:27:54.356
How's Christopher when
he's not punching journalists?

01:27:54.422 --> 01:27:55.925
He didn't punch them.

01:27:56.025 --> 01:28:00.329
But you really
want to know how Christopher is?

01:28:00.396 --> 01:28:01.697
He's pathetic.

01:28:02.865 --> 01:28:05.701
I know a four-year-old
with more backbone than him.

01:28:05.768 --> 01:28:09.071
So, you left him?

01:28:09.204 --> 01:28:10.571
Yeah.

01:28:12.408 --> 01:28:13.541
Thank you.

01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:17.746
That's it.
Getting a divorce.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.716
It's over.
New life. New Maggie.

01:28:22.685 --> 01:28:24.552
Good girl.

01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:33.228
Hmm. And.
I'm not doing it.

01:28:33.362 --> 01:28:34.529
Doing what?

01:28:34.595 --> 01:28:36.732
The next movie.

01:28:36.865 --> 01:28:39.868
I just want to concentrate
on <i>Paper Scissors</i>.

01:28:39.935 --> 01:28:42.071
You know, I want to focus
on something else.

01:28:42.137 --> 01:28:46.141
I've been acting
for the past 20 years and.

01:28:46.241 --> 01:28:48.643
when I wrote this script,

01:28:48.744 --> 01:28:51.146
I didn't know
what the story was

01:28:51.246 --> 01:28:53.048
or where it was going.

01:28:53.115 --> 01:28:55.117
Or anything about
the lead character.

01:28:57.119 --> 01:28:59.221
But now I know.

01:28:59.288 --> 01:29:02.658
You deserve
some happiness, darling girl.

01:29:02.758 --> 01:29:07.096
You've phoned me every day
since I represented you,

01:29:07.162 --> 01:29:08.931
and in the last ten days
you've phoned me twice;

01:29:08.998 --> 01:29:11.632
once to tell me
you were going away,

01:29:11.767 --> 01:29:14.303
and then again to tell me
you were coming back.

01:29:14.436 --> 01:29:17.940
The gap in between
speaks volumes.

01:29:18.073 --> 01:29:21.076
There is something
different about you.

01:29:23.412 --> 01:29:24.980
Let's toast to that.

01:29:26.647 --> 01:29:27.950
Cheers.

01:29:37.292 --> 01:29:38.593
- Goodbye, darling.
- Oh, bye.

01:29:40.595 --> 01:29:41.463
- Be safe.
- Okay.

01:29:41.529 --> 01:29:43.165
Yeah, bye.

01:31:29.304 --> 01:31:32.574
Hey, bud. Come on.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.543
Right,
don't go too far, okay?

01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:37.246
Okay.

01:32:32.167 --> 01:32:34.469
Don't even think about
stealing that water.

01:32:34.603 --> 01:32:36.305
This is private property,
you know.

01:32:38.974 --> 01:32:41.043
You'll find the water
belongs to Nevis.

01:33:30.926 --> 01:33:34.363
Come on.
Let's go get Daniel.

01:33:36.531 --> 01:33:39.101
Still have a lot of vanilla
vines to plant, you know.
