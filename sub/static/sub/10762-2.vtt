WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:10.577
When the phone company says
they will be at your door

00:10.577 --> 00:12.078
between the hours
of 9:00 and noon

00:12.078 --> 00:14.581
they have entered
into a verbal contract.

00:14.581 --> 00:18.451
If they show up at 12:47, they
are in breach of said contract.

00:18.451 --> 00:20.286
Again, I agree.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.221
Well, I just shouldn't

00:21.688 --> 00:22.756
have waited
for them, that's all.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.224
Now my entire day is thrown off.

00:24.591 --> 00:27.660
Still, I appreciate your taking
the time to give me a lift.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.629
FRASIER:
Yes, well, when you informed me

00:29.629 --> 00:31.965
you had to get to
the Promenade shops posthaste

00:31.965 --> 00:34.300
I assumed it was
an actual emergency--

00:34.300 --> 00:36.669
not to return a cage

00:36.970 --> 00:38.972
for some silly lovebirds.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.541
It may not be on the order
of a fallen pant cuff,

00:41.541 --> 00:44.044
but until I get back home
with something more secure,

00:44.044 --> 00:47.447
little Daphne and Niles
are living under a colander.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.582
Dear God..

00:49.582 --> 00:52.819
don't tell me you actually named them
 after yourselves.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.088
A big mistake, I admit.

00:55.288 --> 00:56.790
This morning
when Daphne escaped,

00:57.157 --> 01:00.226
I just kept thinking
"What if she's hurt or lost

01:00.226 --> 01:01.227
or eaten by a cat?"

01:01.227 --> 01:03.696
Or worse...
"What if she meets a bird

01:03.696 --> 01:08.034
who's more birdly than Niles
 but without the substance."

01:08.034 --> 01:12.338
Trust me, no one
is more birdly than Niles.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.543
What is with
all this traffic?

01:16.543 --> 01:19.012
I tell you, don't
these people have jobs?

01:19.012 --> 01:20.513
Some of us have a radio show to
do.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.983
Frasier, relax, you're not on
for another hour and a half.

01:23.983 --> 01:28.021
Well... that
can't be right.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.522
Oh, dear God!

01:30.023 --> 01:32.025
My show's
on in 15 minutes!

01:32.025 --> 01:33.493
I had no idea
it was so late.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.928
Hey, you can just
drop me out front.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.496
I'll get a cab home.

01:36.496 --> 01:39.165
FRASIER:
I'm afraid I'll have to.
Damn it!

01:39.165 --> 01:41.167
I tell you, he gets in here and
wants to hear his radio station

01:41.167 --> 01:45.171
and he starts pushing buttons
like a lab rat on amphetamines.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.684 --> 01:59.686
Excuse me.
We've changed our minds.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.688
We won't be parking.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.691
That's two dollars.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.593
No, you see, we just came in
for a second

02:06.593 --> 02:07.594
and decided not to park.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.062
Just check the time
on the ticket.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.065
Look, it's two dollars for any portion
 of 20 minutes.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.566
One second, ten minutes,
whatever.

02:13.566 --> 02:16.336
Unless you go over,
then it's two more dollars

02:16.536 --> 02:20.974
Forgive me.
Perhaps I'm not being clear.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.810
You see, I mistakenly pulled
in here, decided not to park,

02:23.810 --> 02:25.211
and now I'd like
to just get out.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.513
Two dollars.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.914
I have two dollars.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.050
ATTENDANT:
Sorry, your mistake

02:31.417 --> 02:32.852
you pay; that's policy.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.220
Oh, really?

02:34.220 --> 02:36.723
It just so happens that I have
a few policies of my own,

02:37.223 --> 02:40.026
and one of them is that I do not
pay good money for nothing.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.294
Well, not for nothing

02:41.294 --> 02:42.729
but your car's taking up space
 on the property.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.664
That's not parking.
It's parked to me.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
But it's been continually in motion.

02:46.599 --> 02:47.467
It stopped.

02:47.734 --> 02:48.735
But it's still running.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.137
It's parked.
Look, the fee is two dollars.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.472
.
There's nothing you can do

02:52.772 --> 02:53.840
Is that so?

02:54.274 --> 02:55.742
Did you hear that, Niles?

02:56.109 --> 02:58.478
Yes, and it makes sense to me.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.780
Fine.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.917
Have it your way.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.021
(engine shuts off)

03:08.254 --> 03:10.323
What are we doing, Frasier?

03:10.757 --> 03:11.824
If I'm going to be paying for parking,

03:12.325 --> 03:14.794
we are going to get
our 20 minutes worth.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.630
Then he may have my $2.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.133
(car horns honking)

03:30.210 --> 03:32.712
and a little bit of sky.

03:32.712 --> 03:36.216
Ear with sky.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.718
Ear with sky.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.886
Well, this is it.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.387
Sorry, it's
taken me so long

03:41.387 --> 03:43.389
to pick up the
last of my things.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.891
Oh, no problem.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.660
Frasier's not having
the carpet people here
till Friday.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.428
Oh, really?

03:48.928 --> 03:49.929
When it was my room

03:49.929 --> 03:51.931
he said the carpet's
 good for another 20 years.

03:51.931 --> 03:55.735
Yeah, well, now it's going
to be a reading sanctuary.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.470
He's turning my room
into a library?

03:57.470 --> 04:01.407
No, he made it very clear
it was a reading sanctuary.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.309
A library implies sharing.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.214
I think there are some pieces
missing from this one.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.749
You always say that.
Keep looking.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.684
Why do I even do
this stupid thing?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.152
Some puzzle. There's a picture

04:13.653 --> 04:14.654
of what it's going to look like
 right on the box.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.555
You always say that, too.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.959
(barking)

04:19.959 --> 04:21.494
What's wrong, Eddie?

04:21.494 --> 04:22.495
Come, boy.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.163
He must know

04:24.163 --> 04:25.231
you're moving.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.733
He gets this way whenever
I bring out my suitcase.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.235
He knows I'm going away,
and he starts raising hell.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.169
Boy, come.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.638
(barking continues)

04:32.038 --> 04:33.606
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.608
Well, there's nothing
to get upset about.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.111
I'll be here every day
for your physical therapy.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.012
You hear that, boy?

04:39.345 --> 04:42.749
She'll be here every day
to torture your master.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.485
(barks)

04:45.485 --> 04:47.086
What should I do?

04:47.086 --> 04:51.224
Maybe it'd distract him
if you made me lunch.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.530
(horn honking)

04:57.530 --> 05:00.400
Hold it, man!

05:00.633 --> 05:01.634
Dumbass!

05:02.135 --> 05:05.138
Other motorists
are getting angry.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.006
If they weren't so shortsighted

05:07.006 --> 05:08.541
they'd see that I'm doing
this for their own good.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.043
Like correcting
people's grammar--

05:10.043 --> 05:12.445
I don't do it to be popular.

05:12.779 --> 05:13.846
And I support that,
but in this case

05:13.846 --> 05:15.815
I strongly feel that we should
pay the money

05:15.815 --> 05:17.350
and get out of here
before there's violence.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.819
Oh, Niles, they can get
around us if they want to.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.854
So, what, it takes them
an extra two seconds?

05:21.854 --> 05:24.297
It's a small price to pay
for making this a better world.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.528
Niles, you'll get home

05:28.528 --> 05:31.431
to your stupid, filthy birds
soon enough!

05:31.431 --> 05:35.301
I meant that your radio show
is about to start.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.170
Dumbass.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.005
(horns honking)

05:40.506 --> 05:41.841
Right.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.676
doc?
Where the hell's the

05:43.676 --> 05:44.677
He still isn't here.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.179
It's almost show time.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.681
I swear to God nobody
here has any discipline.

05:51.818 --> 05:55.388
I mean, gee whiz,
I try to make ever

05:55.388 --> 05:58.157
and all it gets me
is a twisted gut.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.926
Well, no more.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.928
This Saturday, we're going
 to have a staff meeting.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.830
We're going to hash out some rules.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.631
I'm busy Saturday.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.000
.
Well, it's not mandatory

06:08.000 --> 06:09.936
(phone rings)

06:09.936 --> 06:11.437
Roz Doyle.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.374
Frasier, where are you?

06:14.874 --> 06:15.842
What?

06:16.175 --> 06:17.210
He's at some mall.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.746
He's still got ten minutes
of parking left.

06:19.746 --> 06:23.149
You know, you don't have to us
the full 20 minutes.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.785
(Frasier yelling indistinctly)
He knows that.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.887
What are you doing?

06:30.189 --> 06:33.993
What? You lost me
after Gandhi.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.795
Just stall.

06:36.295 --> 06:37.263
I don't know.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.733
Read some fan mail,
if you have to.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.135
There must be!

06:42.468 --> 06:45.338
Just check
in my in box!

06:45.571 --> 06:46.639
Oh, never mind.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.908
.
I'll be there when I get there

06:49.142 --> 06:52.211
And when I do, I will have a
little speech for my listeners

06:52.211 --> 06:55.148
about the power of one.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.850
Sounds like everybody's
a winner today.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.154
Are you being snide?

07:01.154 --> 07:03.022
.
Because that's not helping

07:03.356 --> 07:05.425
I will just go
and return my birdcage.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
Niles, you close
that door!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.695
You can't desert me in the middle of a fight.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.230
I'm not deserting you.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.965
It would appear to others
that you are,

07:13.499 --> 07:15.001
thereby weakening my position.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.335
Please, you must stay.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.108
What the hell is going on here?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.876
I'm glad you asked me
that question.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.145
I'm making a stand
against this garage

07:26.145 --> 07:29.582
that holds me, my passenger
and my automobile hostage

07:29.582 --> 07:31.918
for a parking fee
which I do not owe.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.121
He don't want
to pay two dollars.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.389
.
I already told you,
it's not about the money

07:36.756 --> 07:38.791
In fact, to prove it
's not about the money,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.727
I will donate two dollars
to the charity of your choice.

07:41.727 --> 07:44.197
Only rich people have time
for this kind of crap.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.099
Just pay the two bucks, Mr. BMW.

07:47.099 --> 07:50.803
My income and the style of car
which I drive are irrelevant.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.004
Isn't that so, Niles?

07:52.238 --> 07:53.306
Yes. I drive a Mercedes

07:53.806 --> 07:55.808
and I would have paid
ten minutes ago.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.278
I told my boss
I have a non-pay.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.147
Oh. You see, Niles,
this happens so often

08:01.147 --> 08:02.682
they actually have a name
for us.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.951
More than one, I bet.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.819
Just sign the form where it says
"Unable to Pay"

08:06.819 --> 08:08.221
and you can send
us a check.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.557
(laughs)
I'm certainly not
going to send you a check.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.992
Look, most people don't.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.262
Just sign the form
so I can get this gate open.

08:16.462 --> 08:17.530
.
Oh, Frasier, it's an out

08:17.530 --> 08:18.531
You should take it.

08:18.531 --> 08:19.999
Niles, I refuse to sign anything

08:19.999 --> 08:22.001
that says I am unable to pay--
it's untrue.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.769
ATTENDANT:
Look, I really
don't care, Jack.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.905
I just got to get
this lane reopened

08:25.905 --> 08:27.974
Now, it's either two dollars or the form

08:27.974 --> 08:29.175
so I can put it in my drawer.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.010
You know my terms:
you will receive your money

08:31.010 --> 08:32.010
when the 20 minutes is up.

08:32.410 --> 08:33.479
Fine.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.248
Then I'll put in my own money.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.448
No, no, you can't do that.

08:36.816 --> 08:37.383
.
It's too late. It's on me

08:37.884 --> 08:38.683
Go ahead, Mr. Beemer.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.019
Don't you call me that.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.421
!
You put that down right now.
We're not going anywhere

08:42.421 --> 08:44.824
(horns honking)
(Niles screams)

08:45.291 --> 08:47.126
I can't do this anymore,
Frasier!

08:48.394 --> 08:50.863
Will you excuse me?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.801
What are you talking about?

08:55.801 --> 08:57.203
Do you really want justice?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.672
Or is this just an outlet
for your bad mood?

08:59.672 --> 09:01.173
Oh, fine, just go.

09:01.674 --> 09:05.177
And bravo for staying
a whole ten minutes.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.479
Good-bye!

09:10.883 --> 09:11.751
I don't blame you

09:12.285 --> 09:13.653
for bailing
on that idiot.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.023
He's not an idiot.
He's just passionate.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.891
I think he's an idiot.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.327
Suit yourself, idiot.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.466
That idiot
happens to be my brother.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.409
(horns honking)

09:54.961 --> 09:57.530
Don't these people realize
 I'm on their side?

09:57.530 --> 10:01.000
I don't think they care
so long as you're in their lane.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.970
I am doing this
for all of you!

10:03.970 --> 10:05.338
Don't you understand?

10:05.338 --> 10:07.707
us.
No, no, come out here and explain it to

10:07.707 --> 10:09.642
Don't even think
about it, Frasier.

10:09.642 --> 10:10.610
That man wants to hit you.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.578
I'm not afraid.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.956
People, please.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.958
I am not the enemy.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.260
I am your champion.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.029
Well, we got places to be,
so move your ass.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.530
WOMAN:
Yeah, move it.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.332
But I'm doing this
for all of us.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.901
If you want to do something
for me, get out of the way.

10:35.901 --> 10:38.104
Yeah, save the protest for your own driveway.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.539
If you could only see things
from my point of view,

10:40.539 --> 10:42.041
then I'm sure
you'd agree with me.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.542
You see,
I pulled into this garage

10:43.542 --> 10:45.044
decided not to park,
and now I want to leave

10:45.044 --> 10:47.046
but they still insist
on collecting two dollars.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.481
Is that fair?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.050
Has a service been provided?

10:51.450 --> 10:52.518
Even if it's a rip-off

10:52.518 --> 10:54.286
it's better than causing
a big stink.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.488
Ah, but is it?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.056
I say no.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.557
I say we've been trod upon long enough

10:58.557 --> 11:01.060
by people who are supposedly
providing us services.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.062
By the postmen who mix up
our deliveries--

11:03.062 --> 11:04.563
by the telephone repairmen
who swear to be there

11:05.064 --> 11:05.998
between 9:00 and noon

11:06.432 --> 11:09.769
and yet arrive at 12:47 when you're wearing

11:09.769 --> 11:13.506
nothing but a towel
and a head full of shampoo.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.541
Well, enough!

11:15.975 --> 11:19.545
I invoke my right
to peaceful protest.

11:19.545 --> 11:23.549
Civil disobedience is a
cornerstone of this country,

11:23.549 --> 11:26.052
for it is how
the common man is heard.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.054
Can you tow it?

11:28.054 --> 11:30.156
Not with him in it

11:32.725 --> 11:37.630
Well, that's just tough luck,
 because we ain't budgin'

11:37.630 --> 11:39.865
You'll have to call the police.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.967
Good idea
About time.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.303
Go ahead!

11:50.276 --> 11:53.179
I think I've made a mistake.

11:53.097 --> 11:55.548
Maybe it's time to back down

11:55.548 --> 11:56.916
I'm not sure that I can.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.784
I am right, after all.

11:58.784 --> 12:01.220
My principles
are holding me captive.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.289
Your principles
may have started this,

12:05.357 --> 12:06.425
My right

12:06.926 --> 12:08.928
The rigid ones are those
who operate this garage

12:08.928 --> 12:10.796
and enforce
such inflexible policies.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.865
You've been given more
than one opportunity

12:13.365 --> 12:14.233
to leave without paying.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.601
Yes, but that's not the point.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.603
They have to know why I won't pay.

12:17.603 --> 12:18.604
Which you could
explain in a letter.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.606
But, no, you won't
be satisfied

12:20.606 --> 12:22.108
until everyone either
agrees with you

12:22.541 --> 12:25.611
or has suffered
for failing to.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.913
Do you really think so?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.049
I do.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.418
Well...

12:32.418 --> 12:35.354
that's quite an indictment

12:37.690 --> 12:39.759
I've never really thought
 of myself as uncompromising.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.763
Well, not in a bad way.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.433
I'm not sure I like
this side of myself.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.270
If you can leave here

12:51.270 --> 12:52.772
without getting
your full 20 minutes worth,

12:53.272 --> 12:54.640
you'll be
the bigger person for it.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.509
Yes, but then these taunting
motorists won't know

12:56.942 --> 12:58.010
that I'm being
the bigger person.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.012
They'll think they've gotten the better of me

13:00.012 --> 13:01.447
or that I'm afraid
to be arrested.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.383
The bigger person doesn't worry about
 what other people think.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.452
Damn!

13:06.452 --> 13:07.953
I do want to be
the bigger person.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.789
It's just so hard.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.792
You know, we wouldn't
be in this mess

13:12.792 --> 13:15.060
if it weren't for you
and that ridiculous birdcage.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.630
Oh, come on.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.466
I can only change
one character flaw at a time.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
DAPHNE:
You were right
about distracting him.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.306
He seems fine now.
But as soon as you head

13:27.306 --> 13:29.208
for that door again,
he's going to have a fit

13:29.208 --> 13:32.111
Let me get you
some dog treats
to give him.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.587
I don't understand.

13:41.587 --> 13:42.655
I may sleep across town

13:43.155 --> 13:44.990
but I still see him
all the time.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.525
Well, you've got to look at it

13:46.525 --> 13:47.827
from Eddie's point of view.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.395
This person who's meant
so much to him

13:49.895 --> 13:50.793
isn't going to be
living here anymore.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.433
For nine years, he's felt the comfort

13:54.433 --> 13:56.235
of knowing you were here
every night

13:56.569 --> 14:00.005
and making him his
breakfast every morning.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.841
He's come to depend on that.

14:02.074 --> 14:05.845
Now everything's changed.

14:08.914 --> 14:11.350
Oh, would
you look at that.

14:11.350 --> 14:15.321
He's probably going
to get under my bed to pout.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.323
I think he'll adjust.

14:17.823 --> 14:18.824
Well, who knows?

14:18.824 --> 14:22.828
Old dogs get used
to a certain routine.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.497
And as tough
as they might look,

14:25.497 --> 14:27.566
they get lonely.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.568
But I guess he'll adjust
eventually.

14:29.568 --> 14:33.038
You know, maybe I haven't be
en coming around enough lately.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.541
Why don't you and I make
a regular appointment

14:36.008 --> 14:37.109
to walk him together?

14:37.109 --> 14:39.178
Oh, geez, that'd be great.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.180
I have to check with him

14:41.180 --> 14:43.515
but he's free
most of the time.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.851
Why don't we start
tomorrow morning?

14:45.851 --> 14:49.221
That way I can have breakfast
with the old boy, too.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.558
He'd really like that.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.765
(door closes)

15:06.272 --> 15:10.276
and a fruit cup.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.279
That takes care
of the St. Victoria's

15:13.279 --> 15:16.282
elementary lunch schedule
for the next month.

15:16.282 --> 15:20.252
We'll be back to tackle
St. Victor's after this.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.824
Holy buckets,
what are you doing?

15:25.824 --> 15:27.226
Take some calls.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.127
I'm not a shrink.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.462
I can't tell people
what to do.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.698
Yeah, that always stops
you women.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.567
Just rap about something.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.503
Open up a discussion, you know.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.271
over.
The station's I.D.'s

15:39.271 --> 15:40.606
Go.
Okay.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.107
Hello again, everybody.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.110
Well, we're still
waiting on Dr. Crane,

15:45.110 --> 15:48.113
so until he gets here,

15:48.614 --> 15:50.115
let's hear what's
on your minds.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.617
And you know the number.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.854
Give me a call.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.856
Hello, caller.
You're on the air.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.859
MAN:
Hi, Roz, this is Mark
from Bainbridge,

16:00.859 --> 16:02.361
and I made a big mistake.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.863
(imitating Frasier):
Go on.

16:07.366 --> 16:08.367
I slept with my boss.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.637
Now things at work
are super uncomfortable.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.441
Well, Mark, I feel for you.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.944
I've been there myself.

16:18.944 --> 16:23.749
What you ought to do is just
talk it out with your boss.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.551
You went through this, too?

16:25.551 --> 16:28.053
Yeah. And it was weird
for a while

16:28.053 --> 16:32.057
but now,
things are just fine.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.060
Who else out there
needs my advice?

16:35.060 --> 16:37.563
Let me hear your calls.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.565
You're on the air.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.567
How can I solve your problem?

16:41.567 --> 16:44.069
WOMAN:
Actually, I was calling
about something else,

16:44.069 --> 16:45.571
but when you say
"now things are fine"

16:46.138 --> 16:48.640
it sounds like you still
work with this person.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.142
What?

16:50.642 --> 16:53.145
(chuckling):
No. No.

16:53.145 --> 16:57.149
I worked with this person
a long, long time ago.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.152
Then why'd you say "now"?

17:00.152 --> 17:06.157
Because...
I don't speak so good?

17:06.157 --> 17:09.261
And... isn't Dr. Crane
your boss?

17:09.261 --> 17:12.664
Well, no. I like to think
of Frasier as a colleague.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.165
So now he's "Frasier."

17:14.165 --> 17:15.666
No, uh... yeah...

17:15.666 --> 17:17.169
.
I mean, it's just that I..

17:17.169 --> 17:20.172
I think you did Frasier.

17:31.917 --> 17:32.918
of your character.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.420
You can decide
right now

17:34.420 --> 17:35.921
that you're going
to be the flexible one here.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.923
Pay the money and go.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.224
I could break my pattern.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.292
Yes.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.561
I could just pay the money

17:43.062 --> 17:44.563
without proving to everyone
that I'm right.

17:45.064 --> 17:45.998
Without teaching them
a lesson.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.900
Exactly. You can do it.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.272
Sir...

17:53.272 --> 17:55.908
I'll have you know

17:55.908 --> 17:58.510
I am leaving with time to spare.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.679
Congratulations.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.548
Since you cannot understand
the moral code

18:02.548 --> 18:04.049
for which I stayed here,

18:04.049 --> 18:06.051
I'm sure you must be perplex
ed that I am leaving

18:06.051 --> 18:07.486
before the 20 minutes is up.

18:07.486 --> 18:12.324
Suffice to say, I am
the bigger man for it.

18:12.324 --> 18:16.728
And you and your nefarious
policy may now carry on

18:17.229 --> 18:21.100
in what is highway robbery
in the truest sense

18:21.100 --> 18:23.268
of the expression.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.970
Here is your ticket...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.206
and...

18:27.573 --> 18:32.044
your ill-gotten two dollars.

18:33.912 --> 18:36.348
Four dollars.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.184
Four dollars?!

18:39.184 --> 18:40.519
You went over 20 minutes.

18:41.019 --> 18:43.789
It's two dollars for each portion of 20 minutes.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.090
But I already backed down.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.593
Well, if you would've
spared me the speech

18:47.593 --> 18:49.094
you would've made it out
in time.

18:49.094 --> 18:52.064
Tough break, huh?

18:52.431 --> 18:55.000
Indeed.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.140
Hold on, Niles.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.308
(tires screeching)

19:09.715 --> 19:11.216
I can't believe it.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.218
I mean, I always
felt some chemistry

19:13.218 --> 19:15.721
between you and the doc but... wowza!

19:15.721 --> 19:17.723
This can't hurt ratings.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.992
Calm down, Kenny.
It isn't true.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.293
(laughing):
Yeah, right.

19:21.293 --> 19:24.096
Hey, you didn't do it here at the station, did you?

19:24.296 --> 19:25.364
Of course not.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.867
Hey, as long as it wasn't on my couch, who gives?

19:28.867 --> 19:30.369
Hey, the commercial's over.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.271
And we're back...

19:32.638 --> 19:34.206
with our new topic:

19:34.673 --> 19:37.643
Cats or dogs: which is better?

19:37.643 --> 19:40.245
Hello, caller,
you're on the air.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.314
MAN:
This is Jerry from Elliot Bay.

19:42.814 --> 19:43.749
Which do you
have, Jerry,

19:43.749 --> 19:45.150
cat or a dog?

19:45.150 --> 19:47.152
Frasier, I'm so sorry.

19:47.152 --> 19:48.086
I really screwed up.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.821
That's all right, Roz.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.089
I'll take care
of everything.

19:51.089 --> 19:53.659
I just want to know what's going on with Dr. Crane.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.227
Yes, well,
I'll bet you do, Jerry.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.229
Dr. Frasier Crane here, Seattle.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.230
I'm sorry I'm late.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.533
It sounds like Roz has
informed you of my exploits.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.868
She hasn't said much.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.736
We'd like to hear it
from you.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.972
Well, it wasn't my finest hour

20:06.972 --> 20:10.242
Let's just say
that I got in there

20:10.242 --> 20:12.177
realized I made a mistake

20:12.678 --> 20:15.581
and then tried like hell
to get out.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.848
Frasier!

20:19.851 --> 20:23.355
and then a line started
to form behind me.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.858
Fortunately, my brother was
with me for moral support

20:26.858 --> 20:30.762
