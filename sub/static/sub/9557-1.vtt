WEBVTT

03:55.818 --> 03:57.320
What the heck is this?

03:57.904 --> 03:58.738
What?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.451
That's pretty gross.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.956
It looks like a mutated fish.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.583
Is it dead?

04:10.959 --> 04:13.169
No, I think it moved a second ago.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.254
Yes? Wait...

04:19.425 --> 04:21.469
Ouch!

04:22.387 --> 04:23.346
That was close.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.682
My daughter gave me this cup.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.517
Look, it's swimming away.

04:29.727 --> 04:33.231
How many tails does that thing have?

04:33.439 --> 04:36.442
It's gross. It makes my skin crawl.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.738
-Mr. Yoon!
-Sir!

04:41.155 --> 04:43.032
What the hell are you doing?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.326
Don't do it!

04:45.785 --> 04:47.287
No!

04:51.374 --> 04:52.458
Did you guys see that?

04:58.047 --> 04:59.132
Underneath...

05:01.301 --> 05:02.135
the water!

05:10.435 --> 05:13.855
There is something big and dark
in the water.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.607
You really didn't see it?

05:21.362 --> 05:22.780
What the hell are you talking about?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.659
You're both morons until the very end.

05:29.996 --> 05:30.997
Have a good life.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.383
Welcome, what would you like?

06:26.969 --> 06:28.179
-How much is this?
-It's 700 won.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.518
Ah... Not again... Lift your head.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.110
One, two, three... Here you are.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.539
Daddy!

06:55.998 --> 06:57.750
Hyun-seo? Hyun-seo?

06:58.042 --> 06:58.876
Wait for me!

07:02.338 --> 07:03.965
Now that you're awake...

07:07.385 --> 07:09.762
Three roasted squids for mat number four.
Hurry!

07:11.431 --> 07:15.226
Gosh, how much sleep does he need?

07:42.587 --> 07:43.421
Hyun-seo!

07:48.634 --> 07:49.469
Hyun-seo.

07:50.887 --> 07:51.721
Here you are.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.270
Oh, that hurts.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.899
Did your uncle do a good job?

08:03.232 --> 08:04.442
He came, at least.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.069
I was worried.

08:07.403 --> 08:12.742
I was the only one whose uncle came
to parents' day.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.453
That's why I kept calling,
but you didn't answer.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.413
Why didn't you answer?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.290
You think this phone can receive signals?

08:19.916 --> 08:23.044
I'm too embarrassed to use it in public.
You take it.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.128
What is wrong with it?

08:24.670 --> 08:25.671
Oh, and about uncle...

08:26.672 --> 08:30.676
I could smell alcohol on him
when he stood in the back of the class.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.554
That punk, getting drunk at this hour.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.556
Grandpa, did it start yet?

08:35.806 --> 08:36.641
What?

08:36.724 --> 08:39.185
Today is Nam-joo's competition,
aren't we going to watch?

08:39.268 --> 08:41.145
Oh, Nam-joo! Right...

08:57.328 --> 08:58.162
Why isn't it on?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.041
-You know what this is?
-What?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.627
I'm saving up to buy you a new phone.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.171
There is a lot, right?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.219
They are all 100 won coins!
That will never be enough.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.056
There are some 500 won coins, too...

09:17.598 --> 09:19.392
What is this 50 won coin doing here?

09:20.309 --> 09:23.729
This is all from the change box, right?
I'll tell Grandpa.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.816
-Go ahead, tell the geezer.
-Geezer?

09:27.483 --> 09:28.317
Look, it's a dead body.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.195
-<i>Only parts of the body were left...</i>
-That's gross.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.738
Why aren't they showing the game anyway?

09:32.822 --> 09:34.865
Turn to 505. The sports channel.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.159
Oh, there it is!

09:37.994 --> 09:39.245
I made that for her! For my aunt!

09:39.328 --> 09:41.038
A bullseye every time!

09:41.664 --> 09:43.374
-Nam-joo Park!
-Grandpa!

09:43.791 --> 09:45.626
He needs to run the stall,
let's watch it ourselves.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.837
What do you mean?
We all need to support her.

09:48.963 --> 09:49.797
Grandpa!

09:49.880 --> 09:52.258
Let the geezer roast some squid.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.637
Where's the straw... Here...

09:57.179 --> 09:59.390
Let's have a drink. Here.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.517
This is beer!

10:02.560 --> 10:03.561
You're in middle school now.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.897
-What? Are you really my father?
-When your Daddy was in middle...

10:07.023 --> 10:09.066
All right! The semi-finals!

10:09.817 --> 10:11.319
Wow. She looks tough.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.032
It's bitter!

10:17.074 --> 10:18.200
Go, Nam-joo Park!

10:18.284 --> 10:19.702
NAM-JOO PARK,
GYEONGGI, SUWON CITY HALL

10:19.785 --> 10:22.204
Who else takes so long to fire a shot?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.957
-Oh, it started.
-Nam-joo is up. Are you going to watch?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.542
Gold medal time!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.003
I can't watch my daughter's matches,
I get too nervous.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.671
Gold medal this time!

10:30.796 --> 10:31.672
Gang-du.

10:31.839 --> 10:32.840
-Yes?
-Come outside.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.926
-I have to watch this.
-Come on out.

10:38.012 --> 10:38.846
Now!

10:40.931 --> 10:45.144
I received a complaint from our customers
on mat number four.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.022
Their squid had only nine legs.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.858
Did you eat one?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.234
No...

10:53.194 --> 10:57.615
Don't deny it!
Why would you touch other people's things?

10:58.407 --> 11:02.161
Think of the squid
from the customer's perspective.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.664
The torso tastes delicious,
but the legs...

11:04.747 --> 11:07.708
The longest one is the best, right?

11:08.125 --> 11:10.670
From a customer's perspective,
it's all important.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.590
Take this to mat number four.
Tell them it's on the house.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.181
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

11:23.015 --> 11:24.100
Here, mat number four.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.728
-I've brought your order.
-Oh, put it down there.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.732
What are you looking at?
I can't see anything.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.192
There's something over there. Come on.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.115
-There, under the bridge.
-Can you see it?

11:40.699 --> 11:43.577
-Do you see it?
-How long has it been there?

11:43.661 --> 11:46.330
-It has been there for a while.
-I told you.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.706
It's an equipment for construction.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.458
-They hung it for construction.
-No.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.044
I don't think so. It's moving.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.255
Yes, it just moved. Didn't it?

11:58.592 --> 11:59.427
Bullseye!

12:00.219 --> 12:01.929
She's amazing!

12:02.847 --> 12:05.516
I'm not just saying that
because she's my daughter.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.810
How could she hit the exact center
like that?

12:07.893 --> 12:08.727
Right!

12:09.728 --> 12:10.563
I can't believe it!

12:11.105 --> 12:12.898
Let's close the stand today.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.698
It's going in.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.793
-Let's go closer.
-That's a weird looking fish.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.381
Yes, it does look really strange.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.678
It does seem to be a fish.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.431
Maybe it came from the ocean.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.600
How did it come all the way here?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.906
Did you see that? He ate the can!

13:01.989 --> 13:04.283
-It looks like a dolphin.
-It ate it all in one gulp.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.494
Have some snacks, too!

13:06.869 --> 13:09.163
-Have this, too!
-Here you go.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.498
Let's throw this, too.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.334
-Throw what you have.
-Eat this!

13:13.417 --> 13:16.128
-Let's throw this.
-Throw that, too.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.922
-It's going.
-It's going away.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.090
-It's going down.
-It's going away.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.344
-It's going away.
-You threw too much at it.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.513
-It's a dolphin for sure.
-Hey guy, let's just go.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.687
This time there are ten legs, mister.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.981
This time there are ten legs.
Count them yourself.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.818
I'm sure it's a dolphin.
I saw it with my own eyes.

13:40.027 --> 13:44.240
Let's go. Who knows
when it'll show up again?

14:16.146 --> 14:18.274
Run away! Everyone run away!

14:46.468 --> 14:48.512
<i>Gyeong-bu Highway is experiencing
a little bit of traffic.</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:51.307
<i>There is slow traffic all the way
from Suwon to Dongjak bridge.</i>

14:51.390 --> 14:52.308
<i>The road to Busan...</i>

15:02.109 --> 15:02.943
Open up!

15:14.830 --> 15:17.333
Young-ho!

15:19.209 --> 15:21.503
My son must be in there.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.674
Someone help, please!

15:28.844 --> 15:30.387
Hey, mister, my kid...

16:13.555 --> 16:16.392
What...

16:23.482 --> 16:25.609
Faster! Let's go!

16:25.693 --> 16:26.944
Throw it hard!

17:07.651 --> 17:08.652
<i>This is the last shot</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:10.237
<i>-of the semi-finals.
-She's not shooting.</i>

17:10.320 --> 17:12.281
<i>Now is not the time to lower her bow.</i>

17:12.364 --> 17:14.283
-<i>There's no time, Nam-joo Park.</i>
-Shoot!

17:14.658 --> 17:17.786
<i>Because if she goes over the clock...</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:18.704
Shoot!

17:18.996 --> 17:19.997
<i>Two, one...</i>

17:20.831 --> 17:23.625
<i>Oh, no! Nam-joo Park
couldn't take the shot!</i>

17:23.709 --> 17:24.710
You could have just let go.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.671
<i>It seems that Nam-joo Park has a weakness
of taking too long to release.</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:29.131
<i>And today it cost her the title.</i>

17:29.214 --> 17:32.092
<i>She shouldn't have lowered the bow.
She wasted much time.</i>

17:32.176 --> 17:34.678
<i>At this point, Nam-joo Park can only</i>

17:34.762 --> 17:37.473
<i>hope for the bronze medal
at the third place play-off.</i>

19:38.468 --> 19:39.303
Hyun-seo!

19:53.150 --> 19:56.403
-Hyun-seo!
-Hey, come back!

19:57.154 --> 19:58.322
Gang-du!

20:00.532 --> 20:02.409
-Hyun-seo!
-Hold on!

20:03.035 --> 20:03.869
Hyun-seo!

20:10.459 --> 20:11.376
Hyun-seo!

20:15.839 --> 20:18.258
Hyun-seo!

20:19.551 --> 20:20.552
Hyun-seo!

20:26.391 --> 20:27.226
Sir!

20:28.894 --> 20:29.728
Sir!

20:32.231 --> 20:33.649
You have ten minutes to clear the area!

20:34.316 --> 20:35.442
Pack your belongings.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.268
RESTRICTED AREA

21:22.698 --> 21:23.907
Come on.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.072
Nam-joo.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.621
Hyun-seo.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.876
It's bronze. Bronze.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.797
Your aunt brought you a bronze medal.

22:31.099 --> 22:34.478
Hyun-seo, it's your aunt...

22:40.734 --> 22:42.444
Hyun-seo...

22:57.167 --> 22:58.502
Hyun-seo...

23:05.592 --> 23:09.971
Hyun-seo, your uncle came.

23:11.598 --> 23:18.563
Hyun-seo, we're all together...

23:19.022 --> 23:21.817
-Hyun-seo!
-Hyun-seo!

23:23.401 --> 23:24.903
Let go of me!

23:37.165 --> 23:38.750
What are you taking pictures of?

23:38.834 --> 23:41.211
What is so goddamn interesting? Fuck off!

23:41.294 --> 23:43.380
Damn it, someone's parked
a car over there...

23:44.256 --> 23:48.426
Calling the owner of a Hyundai car,
with plate number, 2487!

23:48.510 --> 23:50.929
Owner of an Avante? Anyone?

23:52.889 --> 23:57.561
Hey lady,
how could you park your car there?

23:59.729 --> 24:01.106
So, you screwed up?

24:01.857 --> 24:03.441
I heard everything.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.318
You grabbed some other girl's hand?

24:05.902 --> 24:07.571
You left Hyun-seo on the ground?

24:08.196 --> 24:09.656
You left your own daughter!

24:09.739 --> 24:11.283
You call yourself a fucking father?

24:11.908 --> 24:14.995
You son of a bitch!

24:15.620 --> 24:17.789
I thought it was Hyun-seo's hand...

24:29.009 --> 24:30.927
She's so pretty in that photo.

24:33.889 --> 24:38.518
She looks just like her mom in that photo.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.857
Do you think her mom even knows
that she died?

24:44.733 --> 24:45.567
Not a chance.

24:46.526 --> 24:50.530
It has been 13 years since she gave birth
and just ran off.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.658
If I was his wife, I'd run away, too.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.789
Are you sleeping? Huh?

24:59.873 --> 25:00.790
Nam-il...

25:01.124 --> 25:02.542
You can sleep at a time like this?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.085
What are you doing to your brother?

25:13.428 --> 25:17.307
Her birth was an accident...

25:18.934 --> 25:20.393
and so was her death...

25:23.939 --> 25:25.273
Old people always said,

25:26.191 --> 25:31.738
an animal that kills a human
should be torn limb from limb.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.616
That it's our duty as humans to do so.

25:39.996 --> 25:45.752
Until I slit that beast's stomach and
at least find Hyun-seo's body,

25:46.086 --> 25:48.338
I will never leave this world in peace.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.472
Attention please!

25:58.682 --> 26:04.104
Ladies and gentlemen,
those present at the river incident...

26:04.229 --> 26:05.772
There are probably a lot of you here...

26:05.855 --> 26:11.403
This is an important matter of
life and death.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.363
Those who were at the scene

26:14.030 --> 26:16.366
or those who have come
in contact with these people,

26:16.616 --> 26:17.909
raise your hands!

26:19.619 --> 26:21.997
This isn't something you should hide.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.540
Raise your hands.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.461
If you go home,
it might affect your families.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.629
Raise them high!

26:34.884 --> 26:35.719
Hey, mister.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.680
What the hell is going on here?

26:39.055 --> 26:42.267
Fuck. Shouldn't you start
by explaining what is happening?

26:42.350 --> 26:43.685
-He's right!
-Explain!

26:44.060 --> 26:49.566
An explanation should be appearing
on the news now.

26:51.026 --> 26:54.654
To save time, let's just watch the news.

26:55.196 --> 26:58.408
Okay, the news... The news...

26:58.950 --> 27:01.161
-Take off that shit and speak!
-The news isn't on now.

27:01.995 --> 27:02.829
Shit...

27:03.288 --> 27:07.625
Anyway, from this moment...

27:08.001 --> 27:11.463
you're under our control, so start moving!

27:11.546 --> 27:13.131
This is for your own safety.

27:13.381 --> 27:18.345
We have transport buses waiting outside.

27:18.553 --> 27:22.557
Okay, please move toward the buses
in an orderly fashion.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.895
That's right. Watch your children.

27:29.147 --> 27:33.777
Oh, did anyone here touch
or come into contact with the creature?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.863
Um... I didn't touch it.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.617
But some of its blood got sprayed
in my face.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.161
Don't move! Tell him to freeze!

27:44.245 --> 27:46.122
Grab him! Grab that one!

27:46.331 --> 27:48.291
Everyone, please remain calm.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.379
What are you doing?
My son didn't touch anything!

27:52.462 --> 27:53.713
Let go!

27:54.214 --> 27:55.256
Why are you doing this?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.425
-Gang-du! Get out of there!
-Dad!

27:57.634 --> 27:59.344
-Don't!
-Dad!

27:59.761 --> 28:02.555
Gang-du, don't worry. I'm coming with you.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.141
Stop that! Hey, Number 32! Stop!

28:05.725 --> 28:06.559
<i>Breaking news.</i>

28:06.643 --> 28:11.147
<i>It now appears that the creature,
which disappeared after its attack</i>

28:11.231 --> 28:16.194
<i>on surprised parkgoers today, is far more
dangerous than previously assumed.</i>

28:16.945 --> 28:21.825
<i>U.S. Army Sergeant Donald White,
who fought bravely with the creature,</i>

28:22.033 --> 28:24.828
<i>and lost an arm in the process,</i>

28:24.953 --> 28:27.789
<i>is now undergoing treatment
at a U.S. Army hospital.</i>

28:28.498 --> 28:32.085
<i>After a thorough examination,
U.S. Army medical staff have identified</i>

28:32.293 --> 28:34.879
<i>an unknown virus, primarily in body parts</i>

28:35.046 --> 28:37.632
<i>that came into contact with the creature.</i>

28:44.139 --> 28:47.183
<i>The U.S. Army has shipped a sample
of the virus to the U.S.</i>

28:47.267 --> 28:49.352
<i>The medical team sent to the CDC</i>

28:49.644 --> 28:53.398
<i>confirmed that the creature
from the Han River,</i>

28:53.481 --> 28:57.360
<i>like the Chinese civet wild cat and SARS,</i>

28:57.444 --> 29:01.114
<i>is the host of this deadly new virus.</i>

29:01.614 --> 29:07.287
<i>All military units sent to pursue
and capture the creature</i>

29:07.370 --> 29:10.832
<i>have been recalled due to
the risk of infection.</i>

29:11.249 --> 29:15.086
<i>Only special forces trained
in biological warfare</i>

29:15.170 --> 29:19.507
<i>and disinfectant units are allowed access
to the Han River area.</i>

29:20.967 --> 29:26.055
Damn, they made a fuss dragging us
in here!

29:26.681 --> 29:27.682
What is this shit?

29:28.933 --> 29:30.310
Where are all the guys in yellow?

29:30.643 --> 29:31.478
Look!

29:32.312 --> 29:33.688
The doctors aren't even wearing masks.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.441
Hello, sir!

29:37.066 --> 29:39.944
When might we be able to go home?

29:40.737 --> 29:43.615
-You can't go home.
-What? We can't?

29:43.865 --> 29:45.283
Dad, am I going to die?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.202
Don't say that!

29:47.619 --> 29:49.954
Just do what the doctors tell you.

29:50.747 --> 29:53.750
But Dad, my back feels itchy and weird.
Like something is moving.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.959
Ah, shit...

29:55.168 --> 29:58.296
It's a squirmy feeling,
like something is there.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.508
It's because you haven't taken a bath,
it's okay.

30:01.674 --> 30:05.887
Attention!
Numbers 25-40, raise your hands. Quickly!

30:06.888 --> 30:10.350
This group, move to room 904 now.

30:12.393 --> 30:13.603
Not again!

30:13.686 --> 30:17.774
Don't tell anyone about the blood
on your face, okay?

30:17.982 --> 30:19.818
-Mr. Gang-du Park?
-Yes?

30:21.444 --> 30:24.906
You need to take a lot of tests,
so don't eat until tomorrow morning.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.199
What? Don't eat anything?

30:26.282 --> 30:27.826
Don't feed him anything! No food!

31:22.964 --> 31:23.798
Hello?

31:24.674 --> 31:25.508
Hello?

31:27.427 --> 31:31.055
<i>My battery is...</i>

31:31.139 --> 31:34.893
<i>Hello?</i>

31:34.976 --> 31:35.977
<i>It's me, Hyun-seo!</i>

31:36.060 --> 31:39.856
<i>Dad, can you hear me? Please answer me!</i>

31:39.939 --> 31:40.773
Is this Hyun-seo?

31:41.316 --> 31:44.485
<i>Dad, listen to me! I can't get out!</i>

31:44.861 --> 31:47.196
You're alive? Where are you?

31:47.280 --> 31:49.824
<i>It's like a big sewer.
Really big and deep.</i>

31:49.949 --> 31:51.659
-Where? Hello?
<i>-Dad!</i>

31:53.244 --> 31:54.078
Hyun-seo...

31:55.830 --> 31:57.165
<i>-Come quick!</i>
-Hyun-seo...

31:57.248 --> 31:58.082
Is it Hyun-seo?

32:17.518 --> 32:18.353
What is it?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.396
Did you see that?

32:21.481 --> 32:22.649
-What?
-Wait a minute.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.205
Sweet!

32:37.580 --> 32:38.414
Hey!

32:40.208 --> 32:41.960
Hey, don't go near the water.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.421
Be careful!

32:53.221 --> 32:55.473
Let's go. Let's grab a bite.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.433
Okay, let's go.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.346
Mister!

34:21.142 --> 34:22.310
Try to turn...

35:11.984 --> 35:14.904
<i>Your daughter, Hyun-seo Park, a first
grader at Dangsan Girls Middle School</i>

35:17.115 --> 35:18.991
is on the deceased list.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.204
Yes, she goes to
Dangsan Girls Middle School...

35:23.871 --> 35:28.167
She's deceased, but she isn't dead.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.465
I mean, she died, but she's still alive.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.593
Now you're talking in circles.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.263
So, she's on the list...

35:40.555 --> 35:42.473
Wait, shut up.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.560
-At any rate, there was a call.
-Right.

35:45.643 --> 35:50.439
So, shouldn't you be able to
trace the call or something?

35:50.523 --> 35:51.399
Trace the call?

35:51.649 --> 35:54.694
That isn't something we do
for just anyone.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.029
Are you even aware of how complicated
that is?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.574
"Just anyone"? Is that what you said?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.242
Stop it! Step back!

36:01.325 --> 36:02.160
What the...

36:02.827 --> 36:06.038
Please, Officer.
Let's talk like reasonable people.

36:06.664 --> 36:10.042
-They are just kids, don't...
-What are you doing?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.127
No, I mean...

36:11.335 --> 36:15.840
Your daughter never called you
in the first place, okay?

36:15.923 --> 36:19.927
Your son had a dream,
but it was so real that...

36:22.221 --> 36:24.390
You don't believe anything we said?

36:26.642 --> 36:28.644
Now you're obstructing an officer...

36:28.728 --> 36:29.770
Step back, Nam-joo.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.148
Officer, should I explain it again?

36:32.231 --> 36:33.191
What happened was...

36:33.274 --> 36:37.528
I know. You saw your daughter die.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.864
But she called you
in the middle of the night?

36:40.031 --> 36:42.283
Does that make any sense?
That's completely ridiculous!

36:42.366 --> 36:45.286
How can you talk like that
when you're a public servant?

36:45.369 --> 36:47.038
-What is your problem?
-Just a moment...

36:47.121 --> 36:47.955
Stop!

36:53.211 --> 36:54.045
This is...

37:01.761 --> 37:07.516
This is my daughter Hyun-seo Park.
My daughter...

37:08.100 --> 37:09.185
I'm the creature.

37:10.686 --> 37:17.610
I ate her... okay? And then...

37:23.199 --> 37:26.994
It happened like this. This is the sewer.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.163
Don't you understand?

37:31.290 --> 37:32.917
Is he the one who had
psychological treatment?

37:34.377 --> 37:38.631
He isn't a bad man, but he's in shock.
We should understand.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.175
-Hey.
-I knew it!

37:41.342 --> 37:45.137
Officer!
My daughter is alive in the sewer!

37:45.471 --> 37:46.889
-Officer?
-Cut it out!

37:47.223 --> 37:49.100
You putting up a damn show doesn't help!

37:49.392 --> 37:53.354
My friend's nephew's husband's
brother-in-law is a cop,

37:53.479 --> 37:54.814
maybe we should contact him?

37:54.897 --> 37:56.607
Right, I'm sure he would gladly help us.

37:56.816 --> 38:00.778
You're a 4-year college graduate,
can't you even persuade a cop?

38:01.112 --> 38:02.989
What has college got to do with it?

38:04.240 --> 38:06.701
I put you through school
selling instant noodles, and you...

38:06.784 --> 38:07.868
-Dad.
-Huh?

38:08.536 --> 38:10.871
How long has she been starving?
Down in the sewer?

38:13.249 --> 38:14.458
What is there to eat down there?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.141
You over there!

38:30.975 --> 38:32.560
Hey blondie, stop!

38:34.937 --> 38:35.771
Run!

38:36.647 --> 38:37.481
Out of the way!

38:39.066 --> 38:39.900
Catch them!

38:42.069 --> 38:43.487
Out of the way! Quick!

38:44.655 --> 38:46.991
This way! Hurry up!

38:47.908 --> 38:48.743
Gang-du, hurry up!

38:49.577 --> 38:51.287
-Which floor?
-Close the door! Quick!

38:52.955 --> 38:56.083
I'm going downstairs,
but I'm in the elevator, so...

38:56.167 --> 38:57.501
Where is he?

38:57.585 --> 38:58.419
B4 A3?

38:59.879 --> 39:00.713
What did I just say?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.173
-B4 A3!
-B4 A3!

39:04.717 --> 39:07.261
A3. Where is A3?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.179
There it is!

39:10.139 --> 39:12.141
Stop! Catch that car.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.229
Hurry! Open the door!

39:18.314 --> 39:20.441
Go! Step on it!

39:22.735 --> 39:24.028
-Nam-joo!
-Hurry up!

39:24.320 --> 39:25.196
Where is Nam-joo?

39:25.279 --> 39:26.364
Where is she?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.740
Did they catch her?

39:27.948 --> 39:28.824
-Oh, shit.
-Where?

39:28.908 --> 39:29.784
Where?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.535
-There!
-Where?

39:31.619 --> 39:32.453
Over there.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.246
That idiot!

39:34.330 --> 39:38.417
How could you leave your only sister?

39:38.501 --> 39:40.920
-We can pick her up!
-Pick her up then!

39:41.003 --> 39:43.297
-Mister, can you stop here?
-Nam-joo!

39:43.381 --> 39:44.298
Hurry up!

39:44.382 --> 39:45.424
What an idiot!

39:46.384 --> 39:47.802
-Hurry it up, will you?
-Faster!

39:48.010 --> 39:53.140
Hey, family! Everyone stop. Stop the van.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.269
Hey, stop!

40:00.272 --> 40:01.190
Just close it! Close!

40:12.993 --> 40:13.828
Did we make it?

40:18.040 --> 40:18.874
That does it.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.042
<i>This won't do.</i>

40:20.793 --> 40:25.840
The pick-up fee and the fee for the items
you ordered is 7.4 million won.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.260
Including the Han River sewer map.

40:29.552 --> 40:33.681
Plus, we ran from a cop
in the parking lot,

40:34.056 --> 40:36.142
and two police cars on the road.

40:37.143 --> 40:43.566
Anyway, including hazard fees,
the total is 11.4 million won.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.193
<i>One of the infected
and escaped family members,</i>

40:46.277 --> 40:48.154
-<i>Gang-du Park,</i>
-Wow, Gang-du Park is on TV!

40:48.529 --> 40:51.532
-<i>had direct contact with the creature...</i>
-That's my citizen ID photo.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.784
Is it from one
of those subway photo booths?

40:54.076 --> 40:57.121
Hey, we should record this and show it
to Hyun-seo, that Daddy is on TV...

40:57.663 --> 40:58.497
Jesus...

41:01.292 --> 41:06.005
We don't accept these.
If you're short on cash, we accept cards.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.509
We'll just take the card.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.099
<i>The blonde one
who made direct contact with it.</i>

41:17.183 --> 41:19.768
<i>He's the stupidest of them all.</i>

41:20.394 --> 41:23.439
That bitch! Just listen to her.

41:23.522 --> 41:26.108
<i>He pounced on me and slammed me
to the floor.</i>

41:26.734 --> 41:30.446
<i>I think he gave me arthritis.
I'm sure that I'll need treatment.</i>

41:30.529 --> 41:31.363
<i>That's what he's like.</i>

41:31.447 --> 41:32.573
I know who she is.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.159
Like we can't recognize her
through that voice distortion?

41:37.119 --> 41:38.662
But they keep reporting on us.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.458
<i>In addition, the daughter among
the escaped family members</i>

41:42.541 --> 41:45.336
<i>is confirmed to be Nam-joo Park,
a national bronze medalist in archery.</i>

41:45.419 --> 41:47.463
What the hell?
Why isn't there anything about me?

41:48.506 --> 41:50.674
There is nothing special about you.

41:51.717 --> 41:54.094
There are plenty of unemployed
university graduates these days...

41:55.387 --> 41:57.556
I sacrificed my youth
for the democratization of our country,

41:58.516 --> 42:00.559
and those fuckers
won't even give me a job.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.063
The passwords are all 4989?

42:04.522 --> 42:06.607
There is a white truck outside.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.109
It's a disinfection truck,
you can take it.

42:12.738 --> 42:17.743
<i>There are concerns that Korea
is not adequately quarantining</i>

42:17.826 --> 42:21.413
<i>-the infected. The U.S. also...</i>
-Come on, let's go.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.169
That's the truck?

42:28.420 --> 42:29.588
Does it really work?

42:30.381 --> 42:33.300
This is what you got
for everything you had?

42:34.843 --> 42:38.430
This gun is... Fuck, we're not boy scouts.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.850
And why only two disinfectant suits?

42:42.184 --> 42:45.020
So two of us should just
creep around while hiding?

42:45.104 --> 42:47.106
Dad, shouldn't this be yellow?

42:47.731 --> 42:49.567
If it isn't yellow,
they are bound to catch us.

42:49.942 --> 42:54.113
-It's from a different team.
-Wow, the worst of it all is this map.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.532
Red circles to indicate sewers?

42:57.283 --> 43:00.202
Did you really spend 500,000 won on this?

43:00.369 --> 43:01.203
Really?

43:01.287 --> 43:05.541
But I got it from a civil servant
who knows the sewer system.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.585
It's even photocopied on the back
of used paper.

43:08.335 --> 43:09.587
Hey, a guard post. Get down!

43:12.256 --> 43:14.341
Cover up, quickly!
Your blonde hair is showing.

43:15.551 --> 43:16.385
Get down quickly!

43:17.344 --> 43:19.930
Whatever, you two handle it.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.771
NO PASSING

43:43.495 --> 43:47.082
What?
If that's their attitude, why even bother?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.127
They are a bunch of lazy idiots.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.128
Quiet! Hide.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.155
Mr. Park?

44:20.908 --> 44:21.742
Mr. Bacteria?

44:24.912 --> 44:25.746
Lower your mask.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.381
This is definitely
a Daesung disinfectant truck.

44:37.007 --> 44:38.092
But are you from Daesung?

44:44.807 --> 44:49.228
Yes, but we're a different team.

44:50.646 --> 44:51.647
Oh, really?

44:54.108 --> 44:55.609
I'm Manager Cho from the district office.

44:59.488 --> 45:00.364
Don't you know who I am?

45:01.782 --> 45:06.078
Did you know that there are 14 companies
on shifts, disinfecting the area?

45:08.247 --> 45:10.874
But Daesung just barged in at the end.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.585
Other companies will not
welcome a situation like this.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.713
President Gwak and I
had an agreement yesterday...

45:21.760 --> 45:23.345
Not this! No!

45:25.055 --> 45:26.056
Let go!

45:32.438 --> 45:34.982
Manager Cho, this is all I have
with me right now.

45:35.399 --> 45:38.861
Sorry, I'll see you later.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.003
Hey, Gang-du.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.408
Hyun-seo! Daddy's here!

46:28.327 --> 46:29.536
Hyun-seo!

46:42.591 --> 46:43.717
Hyun-seo!

46:58.315 --> 46:59.316
Hyun-seo Park!

47:01.568 --> 47:02.611
Hyun-seo!

47:05.781 --> 47:06.740
Hyun-seo!

47:10.786 --> 47:12.079
Hyun-seo!

47:15.874 --> 47:17.125
Hyun-seo!

47:20.420 --> 47:22.923
Why does he act like that? He isn't a kid.

47:23.924 --> 47:24.758
Let him be.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.220
He wants to disinfect himself.

47:30.472 --> 47:35.060
He's worried he'll pass the virus
on to Hyun-seo.

47:36.937 --> 47:37.771
The virus...

47:40.065 --> 47:42.985
We're all fine, so why are they still
panicking over a fucking virus?

47:44.152 --> 47:48.115
We have to accept whatever the government
says. What else can we do?

47:49.866 --> 47:51.660
Is it the virus that is
making me so sleepy?

47:53.328 --> 47:54.162
Hyun-seo...

47:54.371 --> 47:57.541
Look on the ground for footprints.

47:58.625 --> 48:04.715
Hey, did Hyun-seo describe
any special traits of the sewer?

48:05.215 --> 48:06.049
Special traits?

48:06.592 --> 48:08.635
We need some kind of hint here.

48:08.802 --> 48:13.724
Hyun-seo said it was a big sewer.
Look how big this is.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.935
Yes, it seems we'll find something.

48:17.477 --> 48:22.190
Sure. Wandering blindly through
the sewers would certainly help.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.318
We need to think of a better way.

48:24.401 --> 48:27.613
Stop complaining! Put your time into
searching another sewer instead.

48:28.071 --> 48:32.618
Hey, tortoise! Just try to keep up.
You're a slow-ass bronze medalist.

48:32.909 --> 48:33.869
-Do you want to die?
-Wait!

48:38.206 --> 48:40.000
Hyun-seo!

48:40.083 --> 48:40.917
Turn it off.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.882
Something moved over there.

49:06.109 --> 49:06.943
Move!

49:07.194 --> 49:08.028
This way!

49:13.408 --> 49:14.242
Get down!

49:19.706 --> 49:20.540
What is this?

49:23.627 --> 49:24.628
It's just water!

49:26.296 --> 49:27.130
Damn it!

49:29.549 --> 49:30.384
How typical of you.

49:31.843 --> 49:32.928
Sorry, Dad.

49:36.515 --> 49:37.683
Did you pee?

49:38.350 --> 49:41.603
A little, because of the gunshots.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.317
Why are they going around shooting?

49:54.658 --> 49:58.870
Wow, this cave really does lead to
the Han River!

49:59.371 --> 50:01.039
It isn't a cave, it's a sewer.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.419
They are all connected like this.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.696
Gosh, it's hard to make a living.

50:33.655 --> 50:35.323
Do we really have to go?

50:37.159 --> 50:38.744
So, you're not hungry?

50:39.035 --> 50:40.620
No, I'm hungry!

50:42.289 --> 50:47.043
If we do this once,
we can eat well for a whole month.

50:48.295 --> 50:49.337
-Don't you know that?
-I do.

51:03.477 --> 51:04.811
Wow, There is money, too.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.105
Don't touch it.

51:08.106 --> 51:09.483
Why not? I'm taking it.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.111
It's theft if we take that, too.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.030
Put it back now, okay?

51:17.824 --> 51:20.368
We're stealing from this place anyway.

51:23.413 --> 51:27.125
Se-joo, this is not theft.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.963
We're doing <i>seo-ri</i>.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.425
Like melon <i>seo-ri</i> at a farm.

51:39.971 --> 51:44.518
Hey, do you even know what <i>seo-ri</i> means?

51:47.312 --> 51:49.773
No? Our age gap is pretty big.

51:50.357 --> 51:54.069
It's like a prank kids used to play.
So, <i>seo-ri</i> is a right of the hungry.

52:10.126 --> 52:10.961
Run!

55:35.749 --> 55:37.375
Hey.

55:44.090 --> 55:47.510
What should I do?

55:51.056 --> 55:51.890
Are you okay?

56:56.788 --> 57:00.792
Look at that... Isn't that amazing?
In this situation?

57:01.292 --> 57:02.710
Wake him up, There is no time.

57:03.336 --> 57:07.090
Let him sleep a little longer.
He needs to sleep every so often.

57:07.173 --> 57:09.425
Let's leave him here. He's no help anyway.

57:10.635 --> 57:11.803
Kids, wait a minute.

57:15.974 --> 57:16.808
Sit down.

57:24.816 --> 57:29.863
Do you think Gang-du really is pathetic?

57:32.073 --> 57:32.949
-Yes.
-Yes.

57:36.077 --> 57:41.624
You wouldn't know it,
but he was a really smart kid.

57:43.042 --> 57:48.339
For example, when he was two,
he would sit before the village store,

57:49.382 --> 57:52.343
and everyone who passed by
would ask him for directions.

57:53.011 --> 57:56.055
That's how smart he looked.

58:04.189 --> 58:07.400
As you know, when he was young,

58:09.194 --> 58:10.904
I wasn't a good parent,

58:10.987 --> 58:12.947
I hardly ever came home,
and I stayed out all night.

58:14.365 --> 58:18.286
And this poor boy with no mother,

58:20.413 --> 58:22.415
he must have been so hungry.

58:22.790 --> 58:25.543
Going around, doing <i>seo-ri</i> all the time.

58:26.336 --> 58:28.838
Raising himself on organic farms.

58:29.714 --> 58:32.800
Whenever he got caught,
he would get beaten up.

58:34.677 --> 58:38.848
In that way, he lacked protein

58:40.016 --> 58:42.268
when he needed it the most.

58:43.728 --> 58:48.858
So that's why every now and then,
he dozes off like that.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.030
I think something in his head

58:57.283 --> 59:00.078
must have gone wrong, too.

59:12.674 --> 59:16.344
Have any of you heard it?

59:18.346 --> 59:22.642
The heartbreak of a parent
who has lost a child...

59:25.520 --> 59:27.647
When a parent's heart breaks,

59:28.565 --> 59:31.568
the sound can travel for miles.

59:32.610 --> 59:36.447
So, I really need to say this to you.

59:37.115 --> 59:41.327
Be as nice to Gang-du as you can.

59:42.161 --> 59:44.998
Don't scold him, okay?

59:46.124 --> 59:50.795
Like last time, "Why did you grab
another girl's hand, moron?"

59:51.212 --> 59:54.465
You should never say things like that
to him, okay?

1:00:00.513 --> 1:00:05.935
You know, I spend most of the day
in the small food stand with him.

1:00:06.311 --> 1:00:08.271
So whenever I hear him fart,

1:00:09.147 --> 1:00:13.401
I can tell right away
if he's in a B- or A+ condition.

1:00:14.861 --> 1:00:16.404
What do you two know?

1:00:18.323 --> 1:00:22.201
But even still... our Hyun-seo...

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:23.953
Hyun-seo...

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:26.414
Hey, you're...

1:00:27.415 --> 1:00:28.249
It's watching.

1:00:29.167 --> 1:00:30.001
Huh?

1:00:32.962 --> 1:00:33.796
It's watching us.

1:01:07.622 --> 1:01:08.456
Fire!

1:02:02.635 --> 1:02:03.469
Do you see it?

1:02:14.230 --> 1:02:16.107
What is going on?

1:02:17.483 --> 1:02:19.652
Hyun... Hyun-seo!

1:02:20.153 --> 1:02:22.613
Quiet! It's moving!

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:27.660
-What are you doing? Make sure it's dead!
-Wait!

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:30.455
It... It's running away!

1:02:31.914 --> 1:02:33.374
Don't get too close!

1:02:35.752 --> 1:02:36.586
Shoot!

1:02:37.378 --> 1:02:38.212
Dad!

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:45.511
Shoot it in the legs!
Make sure it can't run!

1:02:47.597 --> 1:02:48.431
Shoot, right now!

1:02:56.814 --> 1:02:57.648
It's over there!

1:02:59.358 --> 1:03:01.277
Come on, shoot!

1:03:06.699 --> 1:03:07.867
-The bullets...
-No bullets!

1:03:11.829 --> 1:03:13.498
-Where did it go?
-Are you trying to kill us?

1:03:29.222 --> 1:03:30.348
Let's go to the truck.

1:03:33.351 --> 1:03:34.560
You all go ahead!

1:03:35.353 --> 1:03:38.272
I'm going to finish that thing off!

1:03:38.564 --> 1:03:39.440
Just run!

1:03:39.649 --> 1:03:41.359
-Does anyone have any bullets?
-I have one left.

1:03:41.442 --> 1:03:43.861
Good. Give it to me, and get to the truck.

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:45.154
Dad! Come on!

1:03:45.238 --> 1:03:46.906
-Don't worry about me, go to the truck!
-Dad!

1:03:47.573 --> 1:03:48.407
Dad! Just come here!

1:03:58.668 --> 1:04:00.169
I'll take you down
with one shot this time.

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:01.671
Get up here!

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:04.006
Huh, what is that?

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:06.634
Nam-joo! What are you doing?

1:04:06.801 --> 1:04:08.302
-Nam-joo!
-When did she go out?

1:04:08.386 --> 1:04:09.637
Go back!

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:15.643
-Oh, no... Hey!
-Somebody come get Nam-joo!

1:04:17.061 --> 1:04:18.771
-Stop that!
-Let go!

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:20.189
Hurry back! Quick!

1:04:44.088 --> 1:04:45.590
No! Dad!

1:04:46.674 --> 1:04:47.717
Fuck! No!

1:04:49.635 --> 1:04:50.469
Dad!

1:05:22.835 --> 1:05:23.669
Dad...

1:05:25.504 --> 1:05:27.006
Dad, wake up!

1:05:27.965 --> 1:05:30.134
Dad, they're coming after us.

1:05:30.343 --> 1:05:31.177
Dad!

1:05:31.469 --> 1:05:32.929
You two, get out of here! Quick!

1:05:33.012 --> 1:05:33.846
Fuck!

1:05:34.639 --> 1:05:36.724
We should never have...

1:05:37.141 --> 1:05:38.601
Dad, what about Hyun-seo?

1:05:38.684 --> 1:05:41.270
Hyun-seo... We can't get caught.
Hurry, hurry...

1:05:41.604 --> 1:05:42.647
Run!

1:05:42.730 --> 1:05:43.648
Dad!

1:05:43.731 --> 1:05:48.778
What about Hyun-seo... Dad...

1:06:14.553 --> 1:06:15.388

-When did you get here?
-Just a minute ago.

1:09:55.774 --> 1:09:57.026
Nobody followed you, right?

1:09:57.693 --> 1:09:59.528
It's okay, I checked carefully.

1:10:00.029 --> 1:10:02.072
And Nam-joo? Where is Nam-joo?

1:10:03.365 --> 1:10:04.200
Nam-joo? Why?

1:10:04.491 --> 1:10:05.826
You two travel separately?

1:10:27.014 --> 1:10:31.644
So, if you just type into the computer,
it shows up?

1:10:31.727 --> 1:10:32.561
Really?

1:10:32.645 --> 1:10:34.438
Hyun-seo called late at night, right?

1:10:35.189 --> 1:10:37.274
Then the transmitter will be listed
in the call records.

1:10:37.775 --> 1:10:41.153
That means she's within 200 meters
of a transmitter.

1:10:42.696 --> 1:10:43.530
That's simple.

1:10:45.699 --> 1:10:47.409
It's that easy to get her location?

1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:50.329
That's right,
you should have come to me earlier.

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:53.207
Is your entire family so stupid
all the time?

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:58.128
Right... Searching through
all those sewers... Fuck.

1:10:59.088 --> 1:11:01.298
It's okay, finding her
is just a matter of time.

1:11:01.924 --> 1:11:04.093
All thanks to you.

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:10.224
You were always busy protesting,
when did you ever study?

1:11:11.016 --> 1:11:13.394
It must be really hard getting work
at a telecom firm.

1:11:14.728 --> 1:11:16.397
Still, I'm just a salaryman.

1:11:17.815 --> 1:11:20.693
But you must make 60 million won a year?

1:11:22.361 --> 1:11:23.821
My credit card debt is 60 million.

1:11:24.446 --> 1:11:26.156
-Look.
-Wait...

1:11:27.741 --> 1:11:30.744
The time, the number...

1:11:30.953 --> 1:11:32.621
Here. This is it!

1:11:32.705 --> 1:11:33.539
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1:11:34.081 --> 1:11:35.249
Just a minute.

1:11:39.586 --> 1:11:40.754
This is definitely her call.

1:11:41.630 --> 1:11:42.589
-Type this in.
-Yeah.

1:11:43.132 --> 1:11:45.050
ATR1020.

1:11:47.511 --> 1:11:48.345
It doesn't work.

1:11:48.637 --> 1:11:49.471
Really?

1:11:51.348 --> 1:11:54.393
The password...
It must be in the manager's room.

1:11:57.771 --> 1:11:58.605
Hey. Nam-il.

1:11:59.273 --> 1:12:00.733
Where is Nam-joo anyway?

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:02.568
Why do you keep asking?

1:12:03.027 --> 1:12:04.528
She's your sister, aren't you worried?

1:12:11.201 --> 1:12:12.786
When we left the Han River,

1:12:14.913 --> 1:12:16.790
we just separated in the sewer.

1:12:19.376 --> 1:12:20.377
I'm sure she's fine.

1:12:21.545 --> 1:12:23.255
I see...

1:12:35.434 --> 1:12:36.268
Now what?

1:12:37.144 --> 1:12:40.272
It will be hard to get Nam-joo.
It seems like he really doesn't know.

1:12:42.608 --> 1:12:45.778
Then, let's take care of Nam-il first.

1:12:47.154 --> 1:12:50.783
He's a real escape artist, though.
You should be careful.

1:12:53.786 --> 1:12:54.620
Hey!

1:13:04.213 --> 1:13:07.091
By the way, how much is the tax
on the reward money?

1:13:08.592 --> 1:13:12.262
Well, there is no tax on extra earnings
like reward money.

1:13:13.097 --> 1:13:13.931
I see...

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:20.521
Huh? This...

1:13:21.939 --> 1:13:22.773
Hyun-seo!

1:13:24.358 --> 1:13:25.192
Hey, it worked!

1:13:25.359 --> 1:13:28.237
-Mr. Nam-il Park.
-Are you feeling sick?

1:13:28.362 --> 1:13:31.115
-Greetings, Mr. Park!
-Just stay right there.

1:13:34.576 --> 1:13:35.786
Wonhyo Bridge.

1:13:40.874 --> 1:13:43.085
You should go to the hospital.

1:13:44.253 --> 1:13:45.087
Fuck off!

1:13:47.423 --> 1:13:48.257
What the...

1:13:58.058 --> 1:13:59.059
Hey! Come on!

1:14:32.801 --> 1:14:33.635
Shit!

1:14:58.535 --> 1:15:00.454
Hey, Yong-bae, did you see him?

1:16:00.514 --> 1:16:05.269
<i>The cell phone is turned off.
Please record a message after the beep.</i>

1:16:05.352 --> 1:16:06.937
<i>Your voice recording will be charged.</i>

1:16:07.479 --> 1:16:08.397
Nam-joo...

1:16:18.282 --> 1:16:23.996
Hyun-seo, Wonhyo Bridge

1:17:10.167 --> 1:17:11.293
Hyun-seo!

1:17:34.691 --> 1:17:36.568
<i>You have one new message.</i>

1:17:40.864 --> 1:17:42.783
Hyun-seo, Wonhyo Bridge north side. Hurry!

1:18:36.086 --> 1:18:38.797
It's me, Nam-joo. Nam-joo!

1:18:39.965 --> 1:18:42.175
I found it! A huge sewer.

1:18:42.676 --> 1:18:44.720
Right under the north side
of Wonhyo Bridge!

1:18:45.387 --> 1:18:47.139
I can't reach Nam-il!

1:19:10.495 --> 1:19:12.372
<i>Hello? Nam-joo! Nam-joo!</i>

1:19:19.921 --> 1:19:24.843
<i>Are you okay? Hello?
Nam-joo... Nam-joo Park...</i>

1:19:25.677 --> 1:19:26.762
Nam-joo... Nam-joo Park...

1:19:27.554 --> 1:19:28.555
Please calm down.

1:19:29.931 --> 1:19:33.852
Wonhyo Bridge... is it... where is...

1:19:34.269 --> 1:19:36.188
-Wonhyo Bridge...
-It's near Yeouido, right?

1:19:36.313 --> 1:19:37.856
-Right!
-I need to go out for a minute.

1:19:40.066 --> 1:19:42.068
Sit down. You need to get a shot.

1:19:44.029 --> 1:19:46.323
What kind of shot did you say this was?

1:19:47.115 --> 1:19:48.200
An anaesthetic.

1:19:48.533 --> 1:19:52.996
Oh, right...
I'll get the shot before I leave.

1:19:53.872 --> 1:19:56.541
-Okay, let your arm relax.
-But Wonhyo Bridge...

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:58.043
Hyun-seo is still...

1:20:00.796 --> 1:20:01.630
Grab him!

1:20:03.089 --> 1:20:04.382
Hyun-seo...

1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:09.930
-Let me go.
-He's really strong.

1:20:10.013 --> 1:20:13.350
She's near the north side
of Wonhyo Bridge.

1:20:13.975 --> 1:20:17.145
Is Wonhyo Bridge named
after the monk Wonhyo?

1:20:17.229 --> 1:20:18.355
That's hilarious.

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:21.942
Would a bridge be named after a monk?

1:20:23.902 --> 1:20:26.029
Did you really inject the proper amount?

1:20:26.613 --> 1:20:27.823
-Yes.
-For sure?

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:31.701
We did for sure. And it has been an hour.

1:20:36.206 --> 1:20:37.791
-And he's still like that?
-Yes.

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:39.960
Then what should we do?

1:20:41.211 --> 1:20:43.004
We have to start the tissue sampling.

1:20:50.929 --> 1:20:52.514
Why is he like that?

1:20:53.515 --> 1:20:56.309
If we've anaesthetized him,
he should be sleeping.

1:20:57.143 --> 1:20:58.645
Why is he causing such a scene?

1:21:00.355 --> 1:21:01.189
Why?

1:21:46.943 --> 1:21:50.322
Mr. Park, I've heard your daughter
is still alive.

1:21:56.536 --> 1:21:57.454
Is she really alive?

1:21:59.247 --> 1:22:02.292
Yes, my daughter...

1:22:04.210 --> 1:22:09.549
is in a sewer under Wonhyo Bridge...

1:22:17.974 --> 1:22:20.685
Why didn't you contact
the police or the military?

1:22:21.728 --> 1:22:23.396
Because nobody...

1:22:28.944 --> 1:22:32.322
Have you considered
contacting television stations,

1:22:32.405 --> 1:22:33.907
or human rights organizations, or anyone?

1:22:36.076 --> 1:22:41.623
Because nobody fucking listens
to me, damn it!

1:22:43.833 --> 1:22:47.003
Please don't cut me off.
My words are words too...

1:22:47.087 --> 1:22:50.423
Why don't you listen to my words?

1:23:14.656 --> 1:23:16.199
What?

1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:19.119
But now,
he's obviously completely delusional.

1:24:23.058 --> 1:24:23.892
Huh?

1:24:28.229 --> 1:24:29.272
There is no virus?

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:31.941
Right? There is no virus!

1:24:35.111 --> 1:24:37.822
You're talking about a virus
that doesn't exist.

1:24:37.989 --> 1:24:40.617
Mister, they said there is no virus.

1:24:40.867 --> 1:24:43.078
So, you should let me go now...

1:24:44.370 --> 1:24:50.668
My daughter Hyun-seo
is under Wonhyo Bridge.

1:24:51.086 --> 1:24:53.755
I need to go quickly. Please let me go.

1:24:54.047 --> 1:24:57.008
Okay mister, huh?

1:24:57.300 --> 1:24:59.886
You shitheads! You bastards!

1:25:02.305 --> 1:25:05.600
Please mister, I beg you. Let me go.

1:25:06.017 --> 1:25:07.435
I'll give you my food stand, okay?

1:25:07.519 --> 1:25:10.313
I'll give the rights to you.

1:25:10.855 --> 1:25:14.734
What are you doing? Please, mister! Wait!

1:25:16.111 --> 1:25:20.573
Fuck! This is driving me crazy!

1:25:20.865 --> 1:25:22.742
I really need to get to Hyun-seo!

1:25:22.992 --> 1:25:27.247
Mister, please save me!
What is this? Please!

1:25:28.957 --> 1:25:31.793
Hyun-seo, I'm sorry... Daddy...

1:25:40.135 --> 1:25:44.180
Hyun-seo, do you know what I want?
I want banana milk.

1:25:47.016 --> 1:25:49.686
Tell me what you want then.

1:25:50.019 --> 1:25:54.482
Make a list of the top ten things
you want to eat when we get out.

1:25:55.942 --> 1:25:58.319
We have a food stand,
so I'll get you whatever you want.

1:25:58.695 --> 1:26:01.614
Huh? A stand? I want to live there!

1:26:02.115 --> 1:26:03.324
What about your home?

1:26:04.617 --> 1:26:05.702
I don't have a home.

1:26:06.411 --> 1:26:07.245
Really?

1:26:09.497 --> 1:26:12.041
No home, but a lot of homes.

1:26:13.293 --> 1:26:17.672
-And your mom and dad?
-I have a brother, but no parents.

1:26:22.969 --> 1:26:24.179
Muscleman Sausage!

1:26:24.679 --> 1:26:25.513
We got it.

1:26:25.805 --> 1:26:26.639
Hard-boiled eggs!

1:26:27.682 --> 1:26:29.017
-We got it.
-Hot dogs!

1:26:29.809 --> 1:26:31.603
Quail's eggs! Fried chicken!

1:26:33.855 --> 1:26:34.689
Instant noodles!

1:26:35.732 --> 1:26:36.774
Of course, we do.

1:26:37.025 --> 1:26:39.277
Then you must eat them every day?

1:26:41.321 --> 1:26:43.615
You know, kids from Chinese restaurants
don't eat dumplings.

1:26:48.036 --> 1:26:50.455
What do you want to eat most of all?

1:26:53.791 --> 1:26:56.336
Beer. A cold beer.

1:26:57.921 --> 1:26:59.839
<i>-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!</i>

1:27:26.741 --> 1:27:28.743
Se-joo, have you rode on piggyback before?

1:27:29.327 --> 1:27:30.161
Yes.

1:27:52.892 --> 1:27:53.893
Someone else is coming out.

1:27:54.769 --> 1:27:57.939
Please be a guy
with a working cell phone this time.

1:29:49.175 --> 1:29:50.009
Hey.

1:29:50.968 --> 1:29:51.803
Hey!

1:30:02.730 --> 1:30:03.564
Everyone look here.

1:30:04.899 --> 1:30:07.610
Get on the floor! Move!

1:30:08.694 --> 1:30:10.738
Hey, fat ass! Get on the floor!

1:30:12.115 --> 1:30:13.533
-Get on the floor!
-Do you like viruses?

1:30:13.991 --> 1:30:15.201
I'll stick it right in her body.

1:30:15.409 --> 1:30:18.538
You're not lying down?
You want me to spray this on you?

1:30:21.332 --> 1:30:23.793
-You at the end! Open the door, quick!
-Open it!

1:30:24.127 --> 1:30:24.961
You want to do it?

1:30:25.670 --> 1:30:28.673
That's right! Open it!

1:30:31.092 --> 1:30:32.802
Open all of them!

1:30:41.727 --> 1:30:43.855
Everybody get down! You bastards!

1:30:44.897 --> 1:30:45.815
Get down!

1:30:45.898 --> 1:30:48.401
Where is the car?

1:30:51.571 --> 1:30:55.491
What are you doing? Out of the way!

1:30:57.869 --> 1:30:59.287
I'm going to kill everyone!

1:30:59.662 --> 1:31:01.497
Hey, start the engine!

1:31:01.831 --> 1:31:04.083
If anyone follows,
I'll inject her with the virus!

1:31:04.250 --> 1:31:05.084
Start the engine!

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:09.839
What the hell is all this?

1:31:37.033 --> 1:31:37.867
What are you doing?

1:31:38.701 --> 1:31:40.453
What? Who are you?

1:31:40.912 --> 1:31:44.290
You punk...
I even let you eat and sleep here...

1:31:45.249 --> 1:31:49.045
Mister, where is Wonhyo Bridge?
Where do I have to go?

1:31:49.462 --> 1:31:51.881
You don't know?
Do you even know where you are?

1:31:52.423 --> 1:31:56.636
I'm in a real hurry!
How can I get to the main road?

1:31:56.969 --> 1:31:58.262
Figure it out yourself.

1:32:02.725 --> 1:32:07.438
Mister, I need some soju bottles.
And a bag... this is a nice bag.

1:32:11.150 --> 1:32:12.360
Here, I'll give you money.

1:32:18.950 --> 1:32:21.244
Do you think money can buy you anything?

1:32:23.412 --> 1:32:24.830
Well, I'm bored anyway.

1:32:25.456 --> 1:32:26.290
Wonhyo Bridge?

1:32:29.043 --> 1:32:30.503
Oh, fuck!

1:32:30.962 --> 1:32:31.796
What the hell?

1:32:32.046 --> 1:32:34.966
What are you two doing back there?

1:32:35.049 --> 1:32:38.552
Who uses those at demonstrations
these days, you blockhead?

1:32:38.636 --> 1:32:41.681
I told you, it isn't for a demonstration.

1:32:41.764 --> 1:32:44.392
Get out! I'll pull over, so get out!

1:32:44.475 --> 1:32:46.978
Just keep driving.
I'll pay you quadruple the fare.

1:32:47.103 --> 1:32:47.979
Quadruple?

1:32:48.062 --> 1:32:51.816
Wow, look at his hands work.
He's a master!

1:32:51.899 --> 1:32:56.195
You said the north side of Wonhyo?
That won't be easy.

1:32:56.279 --> 1:32:58.406
You see everyone heading
to that direction?

1:32:58.489 --> 1:33:02.702
<i>-Demonstrators are now gathering</i>
-It's going to take all day...

1:33:02.785 --> 1:33:07.123
<i>at the Agent Yellow release point.</i>

1:33:07.415 --> 1:33:11.168
<i>The police have virtually given up
controlling the Han River restricted area,</i>

1:33:11.252 --> 1:33:16.090
<i>as demonstrators have broken past
all barricades.</i>

1:33:23.014 --> 1:33:24.223
Hyun-seo!

1:33:35.192 --> 1:33:36.485
Hyun-seo!

1:34:24.575 --> 1:34:26.619
Are you okay, Se-joo?

1:34:27.953 --> 1:34:29.288
I'm hungry...

1:34:34.001 --> 1:34:35.669
And blood keeps coming out.
