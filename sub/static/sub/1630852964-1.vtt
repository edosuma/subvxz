00:31.251 --> 00:32.952
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

00:35.085 --> 00:36.753
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

00:39.086 --> 00:43.418
<i>Imagine a place
that comforts you,</i>

00:43.551 --> 00:45.485
<i>brings you joy.</i>

00:50.086 --> 00:53.619
<i>Our meditation begins now.</i>

01:01.519 --> 01:04.720
<i>Breathe in for
four seconds.</i>

01:07.221 --> 01:10.652
<i>Hold your
breath for seven seconds.</i>

01:14.586 --> 01:18.787
<i>Now breathe out
for eight seconds.</i>

01:25.721 --> 01:28.487
<i>Feel yourself
calming down,</i>

01:29.320 --> 01:30.888
<i>feeling relaxed.</i>

02:03.822 --> 02:05.388
I'm ready.

02:06.989 --> 02:08.922
<i>You wait until I'm ready.</i>

02:10.056 --> 02:11.223
Of course.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.388
<i>Everything to your liking?</i>

02:15.156 --> 02:16.522
No.

02:16.656 --> 02:17.890
Oh.

02:35.190 --> 02:36.224
Oh.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.556
<i>You're a nasty,</i>

02:40.691 --> 02:41.958
dirty,

02:42.356 --> 02:43.824
<i>ugly...</i>

02:44.691 --> 02:46.058
Boy.

02:47.490 --> 02:49.257
Pineapple!

02:50.523 --> 02:51.958
Too rough?

03:13.825 --> 03:15.491
Cutting it short.

03:16.258 --> 03:18.092
Like the hatbox?

03:18.226 --> 03:19.358
Black market, baby.

03:19.492 --> 03:20.892
I got a whole
trunk full of 'em.

03:21.725 --> 03:23.559
What?

03:23.693 --> 03:25.425
Well, it's my thing.

03:26.226 --> 03:27.593
You didn't know
it was my thing?

03:27.726 --> 03:29.258
I just thought that my
reputation preceded me.

03:29.391 --> 03:30.893
Some of it.

03:31.391 --> 03:33.559
That's what I thought.

03:33.693 --> 03:35.760
<i>116-12, copy 506.</i>

03:36.760 --> 03:38.060
<i>I got the same one.</i>

03:38.193 --> 03:39.492
Then you don't have
to touch it, do you?

03:39.626 --> 03:41.793
Whoa, you need to
chill, old man.

03:41.926 --> 03:44.960
What is the point if
we can't have a laugh?

03:45.093 --> 03:46.760
Point is to do the job.

03:47.526 --> 03:49.493
And a huge paycheque,
am I right?

03:52.259 --> 03:53.794
Let's get the gear.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.426
Sure. Let's.

04:11.927 --> 04:12.894
Take this.

04:13.027 --> 04:14.728
Ah, good.

04:14.862 --> 04:15.595
Phew.

04:15.728 --> 04:17.628
You think I'm ugly, really?

04:17.762 --> 04:19.094
Shut up.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.427
<i>Better?</i>

04:20.561 --> 04:22.129
Yeah, feels better.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.460
<i>Like I care,
you pig.</i>

04:25.261 --> 04:26.294
It's coming back.

04:26.427 --> 04:27.928
Come on.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.962
Could you try some
Russian accent?

04:32.628 --> 04:34.828
<i>Like, you know,</i>

04:34.962 --> 04:36.995
Russian accent, okay?

04:37.129 --> 04:40.028
Don't
tell me what to do!

04:40.162 --> 04:41.162
That's not-

04:41.294 --> 04:42.829
not 100% but is good,

04:42.963 --> 04:43.829
just come on!

04:43.963 --> 04:46.428
Shut your big fat yap.

04:46.562 --> 04:48.096
Okay, okay.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.929
What?

05:00.963 --> 05:02.029
What's that?

05:10.964 --> 05:12.730
<i>Oslo, we found you.</i>

05:13.630 --> 05:15.197
<i>Go, hide.</i>

05:18.464 --> 05:20.064
Oslo, you fat fuck!

05:20.197 --> 05:21.564
No!

05:25.231 --> 05:26.798
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

05:29.631 --> 05:32.197
<i>Finished
before you finished.</i>

05:32.330 --> 05:33.998
You know, he was uh-

05:34.831 --> 05:35.965
The man is dead.

05:36.098 --> 05:37.598
How 'bout a little tact?

05:38.330 --> 05:39.698
Who cares?

05:39.831 --> 05:40.865
Not him.

06:09.365 --> 06:10.265
One, two.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.700
I got this blade
for a steal.

06:22.666 --> 06:24.433
Glides like a dream.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.767
Home Smart Tools
and Fixtures.

06:48.266 --> 06:49.801
Come on.

06:52.201 --> 06:54.467
<i>All right,
help me roll him over.</i>

07:05.401 --> 07:08.401
<i>Oslo, you kinky fucker.</i>

07:29.603 --> 07:30.301
<i>Get her!</i>

07:39.070 --> 07:40.301
Goddammit.

07:40.436 --> 07:41.836
Did ya get her?

07:41.970 --> 07:43.402
<i>No,
I actually didn't shoot her</i>

07:43.536 --> 07:45.036
<i>in a hallway full
of people, okay?</i>

07:45.170 --> 07:46.703
<i>Shit.</i>

07:51.303 --> 07:52.704
<i>What are you doing, man?</i>

07:52.836 --> 07:54.570
- Can you help out?
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>

07:54.704 --> 07:56.269
Come on!

07:58.170 --> 08:00.269
You're supposed to be alone.

08:02.537 --> 08:04.004
There's nothing yet.
We gotta move.

08:04.138 --> 08:05.504
Problem solved.

08:05.637 --> 08:07.338
<i>Peyton Sallow.</i>

08:07.470 --> 08:11.104
7045 Curtis Street.

08:11.238 --> 08:13.338
Unit 403, go get her.

08:13.471 --> 08:14.338
What?

08:14.471 --> 08:15.538
Go get her.

08:15.671 --> 08:17.605
Like chop her
fucking head off.

08:21.138 --> 08:22.872
You can shoot a girl.

08:24.138 --> 08:25.271
That's equality.

08:25.404 --> 08:26.738
I'd do it but I'd
rather do this.

08:26.872 --> 08:28.404
Besides, it's your
fucking fault!

08:28.538 --> 08:29.872
I'll do it.

08:30.005 --> 08:31.605
I don't really hear
your enthusiasm.

08:31.738 --> 08:33.305
I got it!

08:33.972 --> 08:35.671
That's better.

09:10.507 --> 09:11.807
- Hi.
- What's goin' on?

09:11.940 --> 09:13.740
- Let me in.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:14.273 --> 09:15.406
What's goin' on?

09:15.540 --> 09:17.740
I just need a
place to crash.

09:17.874 --> 09:18.907
Look at me.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.074
<i>Who's it at this hour?</i>

09:20.207 --> 09:21.040
Bad things are happening.

09:21.174 --> 09:23.274
Aw, dammit, woman.

09:24.174 --> 09:26.407
Uh, um, uh-

09:26.541 --> 09:28.274
Who are you?

09:28.907 --> 09:30.208
Mike's friend.

09:30.541 --> 09:31.708
That-that, um, that thing-

09:31.840 --> 09:33.107
Mike doesn't have
friends like you.

09:33.242 --> 09:34.407
From, uh, from
the other day.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.841
I'm callin' the police.

09:35.974 --> 09:38.407
She-she, uh, she's the
girl from upstairs, Mom.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.307
Please-please don't.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.941
Shit, hold on a sec.

09:44.574 --> 09:46.308
Here, you know what?

09:46.441 --> 09:47.775
Take this.

09:47.908 --> 09:48.775
What?

09:48.908 --> 09:50.875
Stay warm, okay?

09:51.008 --> 09:54.275
And I will call you,
I promise.

09:54.408 --> 09:55.908
Oh, fuck your scarf!

09:56.041 --> 09:58.209
<i>Don't you
give her your scarf!</i>

09:58.342 --> 09:59.209
Oh, Mom.

09:59.342 --> 10:00.342
It's a beautiful scarf.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.609
It will keep you warm.

10:01.742 --> 10:03.042
Mike, but I really need-
- I'm sorry.

10:03.842 --> 10:05.442
But I really
need to come in!

10:28.777 --> 10:30.710
It's a cold night, huh?

10:31.943 --> 10:33.245
Mmm hmm.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.511
Don't move.

10:54.146 --> 10:55.711
What-what, just-

10:59.111 --> 11:00.677
Oh, crap.

11:09.978 --> 11:11.478
Jesus.

11:13.112 --> 11:14.645
What are you doin' here?

11:15.311 --> 11:18.411
I heard about a hooker in
leather on the cop box, so.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.845
What can I say?
I got paranoid.

11:22.247 --> 11:23.945
Sweet score.

11:25.678 --> 11:27.079
<i>All right, let's get
her ready for Reggie's.</i>

11:27.213 --> 11:28.279
I got room.

11:28.412 --> 11:29.812
No, I'm not done.

11:29.945 --> 11:31.180
Man, I am two for two tonight.
Let me get my saw.

11:31.312 --> 11:32.945
Forgot about her.

11:34.113 --> 11:38.946
There's a guy up there
and he spoke to her and,

11:39.079 --> 11:41.113
I just don't know
what she said to him.

11:41.247 --> 11:42.880
So I gotta deal with that.

11:43.013 --> 11:44.513
I got it, don't worry.

11:46.646 --> 11:49.013
You mean the loser with
the cock-blocking mom?

11:50.513 --> 11:51.813
These cops,
they got some zingers.

11:51.946 --> 11:53.813
Yeah, they're
not comin' here.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.880
<i>That wacko lady
she calls 'em a lot.</i>

11:56.013 --> 11:57.046
Okay.

11:57.181 --> 11:58.313
But you never
can be too sure.

11:58.447 --> 11:59.680
Yeah, I said I'd
take care of it.

11:59.814 --> 12:01.347
I think I'll
fit two heads.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.380
Do you hear what I'm
saying you psycho fuck?

12:12.215 --> 12:14.747
Relax.

12:14.881 --> 12:17.048
It's a joke.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.182
I'll get you back.

12:31.348 --> 12:32.448
Where you going?

12:32.581 --> 12:34.548
Kill those witness
fucks in 308.

12:39.183 --> 12:40.948
See ya at Reggie's.

13:52.818 --> 13:54.885
<i>Whew!</i>

13:55.751 --> 13:56.785
I gotta tell you, man,

13:56.918 --> 13:58.285
I was shocked to
hear from you,

13:58.418 --> 14:00.585
you know, out here.

14:00.719 --> 14:01.752
Yeah.

14:01.885 --> 14:04.119
Well, things didn't
go as planned.

14:04.253 --> 14:05.619
<i>Yeah, clearly.</i>

14:05.752 --> 14:07.819
God, getting dinged
up on your last gig?

14:07.953 --> 14:10.120
<i>That-that-that is
some luck, man.</i>

14:10.253 --> 14:12.120
I don't
believe in luck.

14:12.253 --> 14:13.318
As you shouldn't.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.286
Okay, now look,
I got here,

14:15.418 --> 14:17.254
address is on the key,

14:17.386 --> 14:18.786
<i>burner phone,</i>

14:18.919 --> 14:20.254
<i>you're good.</i>

14:20.553 --> 14:22.319
- Listen.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

14:22.987 --> 14:24.154
I need a few things.

14:24.286 --> 14:26.154
Oh yeah, some favours?

14:26.286 --> 14:27.553
When do you do a favour?

14:27.686 --> 14:29.419
<i>No, you're right,
never, never.</i>

14:29.553 --> 14:31.154
It's an integral part
of my business model.

14:31.286 --> 14:32.286
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

14:32.419 --> 14:34.154
I need a new passport.

14:34.286 --> 14:35.753
Mmm hmm.

14:35.988 --> 14:37.486
Or maybe two.

14:38.054 --> 14:39.921
<i>Two? Why?</i>

14:45.820 --> 14:47.155
<i>What the holy hell, man?</i>

14:47.287 --> 14:49.853
What, what is that?

14:49.988 --> 14:50.853
It's a-it's a witness.

14:50.988 --> 14:51.853
A witness?

14:51.988 --> 14:52.654
Yeah.

14:52.788 --> 14:53.854
<i>Well, get rid of it!</i>

14:53.988 --> 14:55.054
<i>Come on, it could-</i>

14:55.188 --> 14:56.521
it could be listening
to my voice right,

14:56.654 --> 14:57.521
<i>it's hearing my
voice right now!</i>

14:57.654 --> 14:58.554
<i>Are you hearing my voice</i>

14:58.687 --> 14:59.654
Witness Under the Tarp?

14:59.788 --> 15:00.754
<i>She can't hear you, okay?</i>

15:00.889 --> 15:02.222
I gave her something, she's...

15:02.354 --> 15:03.922
"Gave her something."

15:05.321 --> 15:07.189
So this is why you're
not gone, right?

15:07.321 --> 15:08.455
<i>So why? Who?</i>

15:08.587 --> 15:10.421
Who the fuck cares?
Who is this?

15:15.688 --> 15:17.189
Do you remember Laura?

15:17.321 --> 15:18.355
Maybe.

15:18.488 --> 15:20.022
Wait, redhead?

15:21.023 --> 15:22.089
Laura.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.555
My Laura from
twenty years ago.

15:24.688 --> 15:26.890
Oh, Laura, yeah,
I remember Laura,

15:27.023 --> 15:29.157
of-of course.

15:29.289 --> 15:32.422
Wow, that really brings
me back, man, why, why?

15:33.322 --> 15:35.056
<i>I need some answers.</i>

15:35.190 --> 15:36.356
Oh, Keele, oh, man, no.

15:36.489 --> 15:39.289
This-this is way
beyond my expertise.

15:40.489 --> 15:41.356
But for you,

15:41.489 --> 15:43.123
I'm gonna make it work.

15:43.257 --> 15:44.223
<i>Absolutely make it work.</i>

15:44.356 --> 15:45.790
<i>Now, that, uh-</i>

15:45.924 --> 15:48.356
You-you-you really were
gonna check out, huh?

15:48.489 --> 15:50.024
Maybe I still am.

15:50.723 --> 15:52.456
<i>But I'm short now, but...</i>

15:53.991 --> 15:56.857
Well, you might be
a little shorter

15:56.991 --> 15:57.991
'cause you're gonna have,

15:58.124 --> 15:59.590
<i>I need one for
the safe house</i>

15:59.723 --> 16:03.457
<i>and one, two,
for the passports.</i>

16:05.091 --> 16:06.657
We'll see, huh?

16:09.757 --> 16:14.490
So this is the, uh, sum total
of all your ill deeds, huh?

16:14.624 --> 16:16.590
Eh, it's not bad.

16:19.557 --> 16:21.757
I just want some peace
and quiet until I die.

16:23.391 --> 16:24.624
Fuck!

16:24.757 --> 16:26.558
Excuse me, sir,
what's going on here?

16:27.625 --> 16:28.958
<i>A conversation.</i>

16:29.092 --> 16:31.725
Mm, okay,
is that all?

16:32.558 --> 16:35.291
- Yeah, that's all.
- <i>Okay.</i>

16:35.424 --> 16:37.959
You plan on paying for
your fuel, mister?

16:38.093 --> 16:39.625
What the hell?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.126
In a minute.

16:41.260 --> 16:42.758
Okay, how 'bout right now?

16:43.193 --> 16:45.959
How 'bout you give some
respect to your customers?

16:46.093 --> 16:47.658
Okay, so here's the thing.

16:47.793 --> 16:50.492
Ah, you've been sittin' here
for about, mmm, thirty minutes

16:50.626 --> 16:52.093
and ya haven't
fuckin' paid.

16:52.226 --> 16:54.425
So, you could be
a customer, yeah,

16:54.559 --> 16:57.626
or you could be a thieving
son of a bitch, so.

16:57.759 --> 16:59.126
We're talkin' a minute.

16:59.260 --> 17:00.692
Right, oh,
yeah, no, yeah.

17:00.827 --> 17:04.161
And you can continue your
extremely important conversation

17:04.292 --> 17:06.161
after you pay for
your fuckin' fuel.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.592
Can you just roll
down the window

17:07.726 --> 17:08.960
and deal with
this guy, please?

17:09.094 --> 17:10.592
I will deal with it,
don't worry about.

17:10.726 --> 17:12.293
It's called
being considerate.

17:12.426 --> 17:13.659
Ya ever heard of that?

17:13.794 --> 17:14.827
- Oh my god.
- I just don't wanna be out here-

17:14.960 --> 17:16.460
He's a Chatty Cathy,
isn't he?

17:16.593 --> 17:17.460
"Please, sir, can you
pay for your fuel?"

17:17.593 --> 17:19.060
Answer, "No, I do not."

17:19.194 --> 17:20.460
<i>'Cause the world fucking
revolves around you, doesn't it?</i>

17:20.593 --> 17:21.761
He can't see your
face as long-

17:21.895 --> 17:23.194
Fuck.
- Shoot him, just shoot him.

17:23.326 --> 17:24.326
All right, here.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.795
Here's your money.

17:25.928 --> 17:27.527
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

17:27.660 --> 17:29.795
<i>Better not expect me
to have change, asshole.</i>

17:31.426 --> 17:32.928
<i>Fuck!</i>

17:33.294 --> 17:34.461
What the fuck, man?

17:34.593 --> 17:36.162
I'm not an asshole!

17:36.727 --> 17:39.693
<i>Okay, wow,
um, on that note,</i>

17:39.828 --> 17:42.828
<i>I'm gonna go and get
those calls started and, uh,</i>

17:42.961 --> 17:45.361
I don't know, Keele,
just try to relax, man,

17:45.494 --> 17:47.494
it's not good for
your blood pressure.

17:47.962 --> 17:50.427
I need to hear
back soon, okay?

17:50.561 --> 17:52.294
<i>Yeah!</i>

18:29.197 --> 18:30.363
Aw.

18:56.198 --> 18:58.397
Where the fuck are you?

19:28.232 --> 19:29.633
Hey.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.767
<i>We're sorry,</i>

20:00.901 --> 20:02.467
<i>you have reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>

20:02.600 --> 20:04.801
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

20:04.934 --> 20:06.601
<i>Please check the number
or try your call again.</i>

20:06.734 --> 20:08.067
I'm gonna get you,
old man.

20:08.201 --> 20:09.567
<i>This is a recording.</i>

20:38.468 --> 20:40.169
Ow.

21:14.070 --> 21:15.737
Let me out!

21:19.336 --> 21:20.870
Help!

21:24.271 --> 21:25.704
<i>Help!</i>

21:25.838 --> 21:27.403
God.

21:59.772 --> 22:01.872
<i>Let me out!</i>

22:03.106 --> 22:05.705
<i>Let me out!</i>

22:20.106 --> 22:21.773
Stop that shit!

22:22.673 --> 22:24.606
<i>This place is a rental.</i>

22:27.540 --> 22:29.673
You're being very loud.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.574
How 'bout instead of
throwing stuff at the camera,

22:32.706 --> 22:34.439
<i>you lie down and you try
to take a bit of a nap?</i>

22:34.574 --> 22:36.474
<i>What do you think?</i>

22:37.840 --> 22:39.373
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go get some food

22:39.507 --> 22:41.207
but if you're throwing
shit around the room,

22:41.339 --> 22:43.541
I'm not gonna trust
you with eggs.

22:47.274 --> 22:48.373
Okay then.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.275
All right, well, good,
there's more food for me.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.808
You having a good
time in there?

22:59.141 --> 23:02.407
<i>What do you want
from me, you asshole?</i>

23:09.075 --> 23:11.009
I'm not an asshole.

23:11.142 --> 23:12.209
Sure.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.475
But I'm the one
with the gun

23:13.608 --> 23:15.142
so you're gonna show
me some respect.

23:15.276 --> 23:16.375
- No!
- <i>Okay, I'm taking-</i>

23:16.508 --> 23:17.575
<i>No!</i>

23:17.708 --> 23:19.075
Hey!

23:19.942 --> 23:21.509
Pervert.

23:22.742 --> 23:25.476
To keep you quiet, okay?

23:25.609 --> 23:28.676
And stop messing
with the room!

23:29.810 --> 23:31.308
Okay.

23:32.109 --> 23:33.676
Thank you.

23:35.743 --> 23:37.043
You can drink
the tap water.

23:37.177 --> 23:39.442
It doesn't taste good but
it's not gonna kill you.

24:12.678 --> 24:14.044
<i>Phone, Eli, it's ringing.</i>

24:14.178 --> 24:15.711
- Yeah, I hear it.
- <i>It's ringing, baby.</i>

24:15.844 --> 24:16.845
I know.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.111
You gonna answer it?

24:18.244 --> 24:19.678
Am I?

24:19.812 --> 24:21.278
Yeah. I'll-I'll
answer it, babes.

24:21.411 --> 24:23.278
- Thank you.
- <i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

24:31.978 --> 24:33.711
Got it, I got it.

24:33.845 --> 24:34.845
Go ahead.

24:34.978 --> 24:36.512
What's the word?

24:37.145 --> 24:38.345
I'm workin' on it.

24:38.479 --> 24:39.978
Why are you calling
the house, man?

24:40.112 --> 24:43.112
'Cause I called your cell
phone like three times already.

24:43.512 --> 24:45.179
Turn off that opera crap.

24:45.979 --> 24:48.546
It's the Thompson
Symphony Orchestra

24:48.679 --> 24:50.379
and it's very soothing.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.479
I'm losing my
mind out here.

24:54.879 --> 24:55.979
How much longer?

24:56.113 --> 24:57.579
See, Keele,

24:57.712 --> 25:00.380
you could use a little symphony
in your life, my friend.

25:00.513 --> 25:02.280
What has she told you?

25:02.413 --> 25:05.079
Well, we're not
conversing at the moment.

25:05.213 --> 25:08.046
She's called me an asshole
and also a pervert.

25:09.313 --> 25:10.647
So you get her
to talk, right?

25:10.780 --> 25:12.513
Maybe she tells you
what you need to know,

25:12.647 --> 25:13.647
end of story.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.380
And how do I do that?

25:15.513 --> 25:16.513
Isn't that what you do?

25:16.647 --> 25:18.014
<i>No, for some reason,</i>

25:18.147 --> 25:19.147
I don't actually get to
know the people I murder,

25:19.281 --> 25:20.780
ya fuckin' moron.

25:21.414 --> 25:23.214
Look, it's special
circumstances.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.713
Now look,

25:24.847 --> 25:26.581
I hate to be the one to
tell you this but, um,

25:26.713 --> 25:28.681
<i>yeah, it's your new
friend who's lookin' for ya,</i>

25:28.814 --> 25:30.681
<i>so just prepare yourself.</i>

25:32.481 --> 25:34.047
That was quick.

25:36.247 --> 25:38.447
<i>Well then you just
better hurry up, okay?</i>

25:38.581 --> 25:40.414
<i>I can't take much
more of this.</i>

25:40.548 --> 25:42.081
This place.

25:42.215 --> 25:43.781
This girl.

25:43.915 --> 25:45.714
I mean, I thought I was done
with other people's bullshit.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.448
Look, there's-there's
one of him and two of you.

25:48.582 --> 25:50.848
So just leave her
there, right?

25:50.981 --> 25:53.948
<i>Let her be Palmer's problem,
just get outta there.</i>

25:54.081 --> 25:55.448
<i>It's just a thought.</i>

25:55.615 --> 25:57.415
My guys are on it,
I'm waiting on them.

25:57.549 --> 25:58.649
Who's on the phone?

25:58.782 --> 26:01.082
Uh, I put a rush
on your provolone.

26:02.582 --> 26:04.448
- Twenty.
- I'm good.

26:07.582 --> 26:08.882
I put a rush
on your order

26:09.016 --> 26:10.982
on account of the
whole Palmer thing.

26:11.116 --> 26:13.449
Nobody knows where you are
so if you can stand it-

26:13.583 --> 26:15.016
I can stand it.

26:15.149 --> 26:17.550
<i>Then just sit tight
and I'll be in touch.</i>

26:21.082 --> 26:22.316
Babes, I could eat.

26:22.449 --> 26:23.983
I could eat.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.856
Hey!

29:07.956 --> 29:09.456
Hello?

29:09.956 --> 29:11.456
Help!

29:29.091 --> 29:30.591
Okay.

30:16.992 --> 30:19.127
And so I'm like,
I take his money,

30:19.260 --> 30:20.692
and he hits me on
the fucking head.

30:20.826 --> 30:23.526
It's like, bam,
on the ground.

30:23.660 --> 30:25.860
<i>What the fuck is
that about, right?</i>

32:06.730 --> 32:07.965
<i>Hey!</i>

32:10.864 --> 32:12.098
Oh my god,
what have you done?

32:12.232 --> 32:13.397
What did you do?

32:18.898 --> 32:20.965
<i>Goddammit.</i>

32:25.965 --> 32:27.965
No, let me go!

32:32.431 --> 32:33.265
Stop it.

32:33.398 --> 32:34.299
No!

32:34.431 --> 32:35.299
Stop it!

32:37.398 --> 32:38.966
Just do it already!

32:39.099 --> 32:40.431
Do what?

32:40.565 --> 32:43.765
You're gonna do it,
so just do it.

32:53.266 --> 32:54.766
I'm not.

33:51.601 --> 33:53.102
Little bitch.

33:53.836 --> 33:55.836
<i>You said two hours.</i>

33:55.969 --> 33:58.368
Well, how long is
the lab saying now?

33:59.468 --> 34:02.036
You have
everything you need.

34:03.036 --> 34:05.368
No, you can't
fucking email me!

34:05.502 --> 34:06.870
Because this never happened!

34:07.002 --> 34:09.602
Look, it's not my DNA.

34:12.169 --> 34:13.070
Doesn't matter!

34:13.203 --> 34:14.569
Babe.

34:14.970 --> 34:18.037
Yeah, no, just, uh, tell me,
uh, when to pick up the order

34:18.170 --> 34:19.702
and I'll be there.

34:20.635 --> 34:22.403
Love you, love you.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.003
And we never spoke, okay?

34:31.503 --> 34:33.070
Oh it's good!

34:33.204 --> 34:34.871
Babe, it's good.

34:35.503 --> 34:37.071
Fucking good.

35:17.206 --> 35:19.905
<i>Let's try this again, okay?</i>

35:20.039 --> 35:21.605
<i>Good morning!</i>

35:22.405 --> 35:23.906
Listen,

35:24.705 --> 35:27.173
none of this shit from earlier,
all right?

35:27.306 --> 35:28.873
I forgive you.

35:32.773 --> 35:34.638
Eggs coming through, here.

35:53.506 --> 35:55.041
Okay.

35:56.439 --> 35:57.941
Sorry there's no cutlery.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.141
<i>You know why.</i>

36:00.941 --> 36:03.841
<i>And there's no toaster
here so don't even ask.</i>

36:03.974 --> 36:06.741
<i>I guess that's what they
call roughin' it, huh?</i>

36:20.142 --> 36:22.440
Okay, look, we got
off to a bad start.

36:22.574 --> 36:24.540
<i>But I'm feeding you now,
aren't I?</i>

36:29.275 --> 36:32.042
<i>You're quite the
little fighter though.</i>

36:32.175 --> 36:33.709
Give you that.

36:46.109 --> 36:49.509
So I got some coffee,
you want some coffee?

36:51.776 --> 36:54.076
<i>Look, the sooner
you start talking,</i>

36:54.210 --> 36:55.710
the better things will be.

37:00.977 --> 37:02.542
All right.

37:03.077 --> 37:04.777
Well, this was nice!

38:09.545 --> 38:11.445
Help!

38:14.279 --> 38:16.013
You ready to talk?

38:16.847 --> 38:18.613
<i>I want coffee.</i>

38:20.246 --> 38:21.780
Now you want coffee?

38:22.247 --> 38:23.780
<i>Yes.</i>

38:26.247 --> 38:27.780
Now she wants coffee.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.814
Let's go.

38:38.781 --> 38:40.346
Stand up.

39:00.882 --> 39:03.281
This wouldn't be able to
slide under the door anyway,

39:03.414 --> 39:04.949
would it?

39:13.480 --> 39:15.815
Mm!

39:15.949 --> 39:17.815
It's nuclear.

39:17.949 --> 39:18.815
What?

39:18.949 --> 39:20.516
Extremely hot?

39:21.448 --> 39:22.549
I didn't know.

39:22.683 --> 39:24.115
Well you coulda
checked first.

39:24.249 --> 39:25.481
Yeah, I coulda done
your nails first too

39:25.616 --> 39:27.516
but life's not fair,
is it?

39:39.749 --> 39:41.916
You got make up
on your scar.

39:42.050 --> 39:43.584
There.

39:44.116 --> 39:45.684
How'd you get that?

39:46.317 --> 39:47.183
I don't know.

39:47.317 --> 39:48.349
You don't know?

39:48.483 --> 39:49.983
No.

39:50.116 --> 39:52.584
You don't know how you got
that huge scar on your neck?

40:02.218 --> 40:05.650
If I untie ya, you gonna
throw the nuclear coffee at me?

40:05.784 --> 40:08.017
'Cause I'll put you
right back in that room.

40:37.485 --> 40:39.384
Stop looking at my scar.

40:44.185 --> 40:45.752
Why am I here?

40:47.384 --> 40:48.919
We're hiding out.

40:49.186 --> 40:50.719
Where's the other guy?

40:51.519 --> 40:53.586
That's who we're
hiding out from.

40:56.986 --> 40:59.053
I thought you
wanted to kill me.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.886
If I wanted you dead,

41:01.019 --> 41:02.019
I'd get my silencer,
take you in the woods and-

41:02.153 --> 41:03.687
Then why am I here?

41:04.653 --> 41:06.320
I need to ask you
some questions.

41:06.453 --> 41:08.020
About what?

41:10.020 --> 41:11.587
Who are you?

41:12.221 --> 41:13.320
Peyton Sallow.

41:13.453 --> 41:15.154
Yeah, I know that.

41:15.287 --> 41:16.787
Then why'd you ask?

41:18.254 --> 41:19.820
Just tell me somethin'.

41:21.720 --> 41:24.020
About yourself, you know,
just somethin'.

41:25.721 --> 41:27.187
My name is Peyton Sallow.

41:27.321 --> 41:28.588
I saw you kill a guy,

41:28.721 --> 41:29.888
what else do
you wanna know?

41:30.020 --> 41:31.054
Christ, no, I mean,

41:31.187 --> 41:32.921
like where you from, just-

41:33.754 --> 41:35.055
Detroit.

41:35.721 --> 41:37.088
Where'd you grow up?

41:37.222 --> 41:38.788
Detroit.

41:39.554 --> 41:42.754
And what about your mom,
or your dad?

41:44.921 --> 41:45.888
What about them?

41:46.021 --> 41:47.422
<i>I don't know,
just somethin'.</i>

41:47.555 --> 41:49.055
What are their names?

41:49.188 --> 41:50.722
Why, so you can kill them?

41:50.855 --> 41:52.955
Can you just please
work with me here?

41:53.088 --> 41:54.589
I really wanna get out
of this shit house

41:54.722 --> 41:55.956
sometime in the
near future.

41:56.088 --> 41:57.056
So leave then!

41:57.188 --> 41:58.056
You're making me stay.

41:58.188 --> 41:59.622
No I'm not!

41:59.755 --> 42:02.089
Yeah, the fact that you exist
is making me stay, okay?

42:03.256 --> 42:04.555
Okay.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.722
Okay, Jesus, what's
with all the attitude?

42:06.856 --> 42:08.323
You're freaking me out, okay?!

42:08.456 --> 42:09.323
I'm freaking you out?

42:09.456 --> 42:10.755
Yeah.

42:10.889 --> 42:11.656
Me just talkin' to you
is freaking you out?

42:11.789 --> 42:12.722
Yeah!

42:12.856 --> 42:13.656
Okay, well then,
I'm gonna freak out too.

42:13.789 --> 42:14.922
Let's all freak out!

42:15.056 --> 42:16.623
I'm gonna freak out, yup.

42:16.756 --> 42:18.356
Freakin' out, ohhhh!

42:22.256 --> 42:23.823
Jesus.

42:34.756 --> 42:36.657
I don't need this shit.

42:40.591 --> 42:41.890
You've got a problem.

42:42.023 --> 42:44.490
Yeah, and you're a hooker
tied to a chair, so.

42:44.624 --> 42:46.157
I'm a call girl,
there's a difference.

42:46.290 --> 42:47.858
Yeah, not much.

42:47.991 --> 42:49.490
You're judging me?

42:50.390 --> 42:51.824
You cut off people's heads.

42:51.958 --> 42:54.557
I do not cut off people's heads,
that's the other guy.

42:54.691 --> 42:56.258
Yeah, well,
you're still a murderer.

42:56.391 --> 42:58.724
And you rent yourself
out by the hour!

42:59.292 --> 43:00.858
And you don't?

43:20.625 --> 43:22.992
Oh, stop crying.

43:29.959 --> 43:33.025
Will you just,
can you just stop, please?

43:35.159 --> 43:37.293
I can't breathe.

43:37.426 --> 43:38.426
Stop crying.

44:22.094 --> 44:23.795
Put the glass down.

44:29.995 --> 44:31.928
That's it, you're going
back in the room.

44:32.062 --> 44:33.062
No.

44:33.196 --> 44:34.330
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:34.462 --> 44:36.595
You had your chance
and you blew it.

44:36.728 --> 44:37.862
I promise I won't
do it again.

44:37.995 --> 44:40.429
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- You can trust me.

44:41.230 --> 44:42.395
Yeah, I don't think so.

44:42.529 --> 44:45.062
<i>Fine, you wanna
know about me?</i>

44:46.362 --> 44:47.963
About this?

44:51.929 --> 44:53.462
I was nine.

44:54.529 --> 44:56.863
<i>Like usual,
there's a new guy over.</i>

44:58.363 --> 45:00.096
And he's drunk.

45:03.729 --> 45:05.264
I walked into the kitchen

45:05.396 --> 45:08.129
and I guess he didn't like me
drinking his orange juice.

45:10.730 --> 45:13.864
He had a ring on, so.

45:33.898 --> 45:37.664
That other guy who chops
people's heads off,

45:37.798 --> 45:39.332
he wants to kill you.

45:40.098 --> 45:43.132
So if you run from here,
he'll do anything to find you.

45:44.233 --> 45:46.631
I'm the only thing
between you and him.

45:47.965 --> 45:49.498
You got it?

45:51.132 --> 45:52.632
Okay.

46:08.432 --> 46:10.999
You can't walk
around in that.

46:12.732 --> 46:14.665
What's wrong with this?

46:17.466 --> 46:20.167
You might be more
comfortable in these.

46:20.300 --> 46:21.866
<i>Bathroom's upstairs.</i>

47:34.902 --> 47:36.870
You guy with the complaint?

47:37.002 --> 47:38.103
And the grey van?

47:38.237 --> 47:39.402
Another one?

47:39.536 --> 47:41.103
Yeah, I got assigned
to your case.

47:41.237 --> 47:43.104
So, you must be special.

47:44.870 --> 47:48.104
Okay, I'm not just some
guy with a complaint, okay?

47:48.238 --> 47:49.403
I'm Doug.

47:49.536 --> 47:51.238
Assistant Manager.

47:51.370 --> 47:52.936
You sound special, Doug.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.037
Talk to the other cops.
I don't got all day.

47:56.171 --> 47:57.936
<i>You bandage that yourself?</i>

47:58.936 --> 48:00.470
This? Yeah.

48:01.338 --> 48:02.971
Well, it's a
little dramatic.

48:03.537 --> 48:05.871
Well, it hurts,
a lot, so.

48:06.005 --> 48:08.238
<i>A customer might find
that off-putting.</i>

48:08.370 --> 48:10.271
<i>They might think that
a crime happened here</i>

48:10.403 --> 48:12.637
<i>and then they might decide to
take their business elsewhere.</i>

48:12.770 --> 48:15.072
And I'm sure that my
presence isn't helping.

48:16.205 --> 48:18.637
You got a question about
these guys or what?

48:19.404 --> 48:20.904
Guys?

48:21.038 --> 48:24.272
<i>Like I told yous before,
there's two guys in a car.</i>

48:24.404 --> 48:25.504
One of them didn't
pay his bill

48:25.638 --> 48:27.471
so I approached
the vehicle.

48:28.705 --> 48:30.404
Did you get a licence plate
on the other vehicle?

48:30.538 --> 48:33.771
Again, it's 551UF,

48:33.905 --> 48:35.173
I fucking forget
the last two.

48:35.305 --> 48:38.372
But it was a-is a
black muscle car.

48:39.173 --> 48:40.738
Real nice car.

48:42.405 --> 48:44.139
<i>This one of the guys?</i>

48:47.572 --> 48:48.938
Yeah.

48:49.073 --> 48:51.439
Yeah, that's the fuckin'
asshole right there, yeah.

48:51.572 --> 48:53.772
Ah, the other guy,
can you describe him?

48:55.139 --> 48:56.439
Real Jewy, man.

48:56.572 --> 48:58.207
I don't know what else
to fuckin' tell ya.

48:58.340 --> 49:00.806
Again, you guys have gotta
get your heads together, man.

49:00.940 --> 49:03.539
<i>The crime in this town
is going through the,</i>

49:03.672 --> 49:05.174
through the fuckin'
roof, okay?

49:05.307 --> 49:06.174
Do your job.

49:07.307 --> 49:08.174
<i>Do your job.</i>

49:08.307 --> 49:09.373
Yeah.

49:09.506 --> 49:10.473
Ah, thank you
for your tips.

49:10.607 --> 49:11.940
Um, listen.

49:12.074 --> 49:14.040
Do you mind following
me back to my vehicle?

49:14.174 --> 49:16.740
I've got some headshots
I'd like you to review.

49:17.941 --> 49:19.473
You couldn't-you couldn't
have fuckin', oh god.

49:19.607 --> 49:21.406
Make it quick, okay,
I don't got all day.

49:21.540 --> 49:23.075
It'll only take a second.

50:41.509 --> 50:43.078
Hello?

50:44.410 --> 50:45.978
<i>Hello?</i>

50:47.078 --> 50:47.944
<i>Hello?</i>

50:53.211 --> 50:54.744
Got you.

50:55.245 --> 50:56.744
Hello?

50:58.879 --> 51:00.079
<i>Baby, who is it?</i>

51:00.211 --> 51:01.744
No one, babes.

51:19.545 --> 51:21.112
<i>Feel better?</i>

51:21.246 --> 51:22.212
Huh?

51:22.346 --> 51:23.678
<i>The clothes.</i>

51:23.813 --> 51:25.578
<i>Come sit in here.</i>

51:48.147 --> 51:50.512
What are those pills for?

51:53.613 --> 51:55.380
Bunch of things.

51:57.746 --> 51:59.314
You ever try breathing?

51:59.447 --> 52:02.714
Yeah. Yeah, I try breathing.

52:02.847 --> 52:05.947
No like four, seven, eight?

52:06.815 --> 52:09.413
<i>When you're stressed
out you close your eyes,</i>

52:09.547 --> 52:11.082
count in for four.

52:13.048 --> 52:14.614
<i>Hold for seven.</i>

52:17.380 --> 52:18.915
<i>Then you go out for eight.</i>

52:20.148 --> 52:21.680
Until you feel better.

52:22.082 --> 52:23.315
<i>Try it.</i>

52:23.448 --> 52:25.215
That's some real hippy
crap right there.

52:25.349 --> 52:27.215
<i>No, it's not.</i>

52:28.015 --> 52:30.448
It's an actual
medical thing.

52:30.581 --> 52:33.115
I promise it works,
just try it.

52:34.816 --> 52:36.115
Come on.

52:37.749 --> 52:39.548
It'll make you
feel better.

52:52.916 --> 52:54.983
Nope, don't feel
any better.

52:57.350 --> 52:59.083
<i>Does that make you calm?</i>

52:59.817 --> 53:01.382
Mmm hmm.

53:04.184 --> 53:07.415
So is what you said about
that other guy true?

53:10.117 --> 53:11.582
Yeah, it's true.

53:12.084 --> 53:13.617
<i>His name's Palmer.</i>

53:14.383 --> 53:15.817
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

53:15.950 --> 53:17.718
Are you gonna
turn him in?

53:19.184 --> 53:23.284
No, with these people,
there's always another guy.

53:23.416 --> 53:24.985
So what are we gonna do?

53:26.383 --> 53:28.284
There's only two ways out.

53:28.784 --> 53:32.583
Listen, gotta tell
you something.

53:36.650 --> 53:38.584
I'm taking you to Argentina.

53:39.417 --> 53:40.751
What?

53:40.885 --> 53:43.685
Yeah, I thought I'd-I'd
take you somewhere

53:43.819 --> 53:45.752
that you're gonna like.

53:46.986 --> 53:49.019
That's my stuff!

53:50.285 --> 53:51.919
Yeah, it's not embarrassing.

53:53.285 --> 53:54.384
See this?

53:54.517 --> 53:56.517
That's personal!

53:57.052 --> 53:58.385
So what?

53:58.517 --> 54:00.253
Do you know how much shit I
usually collect on my marks?

54:00.385 --> 54:01.685
That's fuck all.

54:02.353 --> 54:05.152
And how 'bout little bit of
fucking gratitude here, huh?

54:05.286 --> 54:07.152
I am not going.

54:07.286 --> 54:08.853
You don't have a choice!

54:10.552 --> 54:12.052
Hey!

54:13.020 --> 54:14.653
Give her back.

54:14.786 --> 54:16.153
No.

54:21.820 --> 54:23.220
<i>Oh, I'm sorry,
did you want this?</i>

54:23.354 --> 54:26.419
Oh, what are you gonna
do with that now, huh?

54:26.553 --> 54:27.419
Hey.

54:27.553 --> 54:28.419
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

54:30.654 --> 54:31.953
Don't, don't.

54:33.220 --> 54:34.453
No!

54:39.721 --> 54:41.419
Get back here!

54:42.021 --> 54:43.553
Peyton!

54:44.586 --> 54:46.654
Peyton, stop, hey!

54:49.420 --> 54:50.954
<i>HELP!</i>

54:59.321 --> 55:00.822
<i>I hate you!</i>

55:19.256 --> 55:20.822
<i>Whoa.</i>

55:22.222 --> 55:23.789
Palmer.

55:25.488 --> 55:26.956
Swanky.

55:27.656 --> 55:30.023
Why don't you just knock
like a normal person here?

55:30.156 --> 55:31.521
<i>What-what's-what's
going on?</i>

55:31.656 --> 55:32.923
What's with the badge?

55:33.056 --> 55:33.990
<i>Oh, you like it?</i>

55:34.123 --> 55:37.856
So did the gas station
guy on 24?

55:38.890 --> 55:40.357
Said he saw you
there with Keele.

55:40.489 --> 55:41.890
Yeah.

55:42.023 --> 55:44.123
Yeah, see, a man approaches
me wanting a service

55:44.257 --> 55:46.824
<i>as long as he's willing
to pay for that service,</i>

55:46.956 --> 55:47.923
then I abide.

55:48.056 --> 55:49.991
Well, now I'm in need
of your service.

55:50.624 --> 55:52.057
Where is he?

55:52.190 --> 55:53.724
I don't know.

55:55.057 --> 55:56.522
Man, he fucked
with my business

55:56.657 --> 55:58.024
and I don't like
the way that feels.

55:58.157 --> 55:59.224
Hey, what are you-

55:59.358 --> 56:00.522
<i>Hey!</i>

56:00.657 --> 56:02.191
Come on, man,
what are you doing?

56:02.324 --> 56:03.824
Do you have any idea
how expensive that is?

56:03.957 --> 56:05.024
<i>What was that?</i>

56:05.157 --> 56:06.324
Oh, shit, honey-

56:06.457 --> 56:07.024
Oh my god.
- It's okay, everything-

56:07.157 --> 56:08.558
Hello.

56:08.691 --> 56:09.558
Please, honey, honey, honey,
it's a misunderstanding.

56:09.691 --> 56:10.558
I got it under control.

56:10.691 --> 56:12.091
No, no, no, no, no, no,

56:12.224 --> 56:14.157
<i>this is an infringement
on our civil liberties.</i>

56:14.291 --> 56:15.658
<i>Can you please go back
in your bedroom, go back-</i>

56:15.791 --> 56:17.025
No, take out your
phone and tape him!

56:17.157 --> 56:18.524
Ma'am, would you kindly
shut the fuck up?

56:18.658 --> 56:19.658
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Fuck!

56:19.791 --> 56:20.958
- Jesus, fuck!
- Easy man, easy!

56:21.092 --> 56:22.524
Look, look, I got
this under control.

56:22.658 --> 56:23.791
<i>Leave her alone, okay?</i>

56:23.925 --> 56:25.192
She doesn't know
anything about anything.

56:25.325 --> 56:26.092
She doesn't
know about you?

56:26.225 --> 56:27.625
No, no, well, no.

56:27.758 --> 56:29.992
Nothing, nothing, nothing
important and not that-

56:30.125 --> 56:31.791
Nothing important?

56:32.659 --> 56:33.659
You know what your
husband does?

56:33.791 --> 56:35.359
Yeah, he imports cheese.

56:35.491 --> 56:36.626
- I import cheese.
- <i>"He imports cheese."</i>

56:36.759 --> 56:38.792
No, he's a fixer.
That's a criminal.

56:38.926 --> 56:40.792
He's aiding a
murderer right now.

56:40.926 --> 56:42.559
- What? Why are you saying this?
- What is he saying?

56:42.692 --> 56:45.458
You should be honest with
your bride before you die!

56:45.592 --> 56:47.859
Here, look, look,
I'll start, I'll start.

56:49.692 --> 56:51.293
Well, I'm not a real cop.

56:51.425 --> 56:52.926
Oh!

56:53.926 --> 56:55.059
It looks pretty
good though, right?

56:55.193 --> 56:56.459
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

56:57.059 --> 56:58.526
Okay, Keele-
- Explain, yeah.

56:58.660 --> 57:00.126
- Keele.
- Come on, let's go.

57:00.260 --> 57:01.493
- <i>Keele.</i>
- Come on!

57:01.627 --> 57:03.059
Keele's got two hundred K
on him, okay?

57:03.193 --> 57:04.593
Oh, fuck you, man.

57:04.727 --> 57:06.627
Okay? Well, I'm sure we
can work something out.

57:07.459 --> 57:10.160
- Sorry, baby.
- Fuck! Should've-

57:10.293 --> 57:11.860
Sorry, baby.
- Bastard!

57:13.027 --> 57:13.994
Great.

57:14.127 --> 57:15.261
Stay there.

57:15.393 --> 57:17.127
<i>Hello! Hello, police?</i>

57:18.294 --> 57:19.527
<i>UGH!</i>

57:19.660 --> 57:22.060
<i>You better fix this Eli,
you swore!</i>

57:22.194 --> 57:23.327
You made a promise.

57:23.461 --> 57:24.194
<i>You made a vow!</i>

57:24.327 --> 57:25.361
A little hubbah.

57:25.494 --> 57:27.094
- Yeah, I remember.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

57:27.227 --> 57:28.594
You know I'm gonna need to
do something about that.

57:28.728 --> 57:30.961
Okay, please don't, please.

57:32.961 --> 57:35.694
Okay, what do
you wanna know?

57:37.061 --> 57:38.628
Does he know I'm coming?

57:39.228 --> 57:40.794
Yes.

57:41.594 --> 57:43.528
Why'd he take her?

58:01.096 --> 58:02.395
That's too bad.

58:02.528 --> 58:04.729
<i>Find out right
before she dies.</i>

58:06.129 --> 58:07.695
Wait, wait, you-

58:07.829 --> 58:11.395
You're gonna break the guy's
heart right before you kill him?

58:11.529 --> 58:13.429
That's life.

58:19.596 --> 58:21.463
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

58:22.963 --> 58:24.463
Where is he?

58:36.097 --> 58:37.664
Come on.

59:24.099 --> 59:25.832
<i>You've
reached Eli's Fine Cheeses.</i>

59:25.965 --> 59:27.733
<i>I can't get to
the phone right-</i>

59:37.432 --> 59:39.000
Is it any better?

59:39.466 --> 59:40.933
No.

59:43.532 --> 59:44.966
<i>The van's toast,</i>

59:45.100 --> 59:46.567
<i>and you'd be too if
you tripped that wire.</i>

59:46.699 --> 59:48.467
Well, sorry.

59:49.567 --> 59:51.400
Look, I wasn't
trying to shoot ya.

59:51.533 --> 59:53.066
<i>Well, I know that now.</i>

1:00:10.369 --> 1:00:11.934
Oof.

1:00:12.734 --> 1:00:14.568
That's gonna need something.

1:00:14.701 --> 1:00:16.434
You got a fever?

1:00:33.768 --> 1:00:35.235
You thought I was
gonna kill ya, right?

1:00:35.370 --> 1:00:36.902
Here you are alive.

1:00:37.336 --> 1:00:39.068
I let you out,

1:00:39.202 --> 1:00:40.303
I showed you the plan.

1:00:40.435 --> 1:00:41.769
I mean,
what's it gonna take?

1:00:42.303 --> 1:00:43.836
For what?

1:00:44.435 --> 1:00:46.135
For you to trust me.

1:00:48.736 --> 1:00:50.602
What's your name?

1:00:55.936 --> 1:00:57.470
It's James.

1:00:58.936 --> 1:01:01.703
And what's your
last name, James?

1:01:05.371 --> 1:01:06.936
Uh...

1:01:07.637 --> 1:01:09.503
That's what I thought.

1:01:10.770 --> 1:01:13.970
It's for your own good you
don't know my name, okay?

1:01:16.070 --> 1:01:19.837
Will you just tell
me why I'm here?

1:01:51.538 --> 1:01:53.438
<i>I knew your mother.</i>

1:01:55.971 --> 1:01:56.939
How?

1:01:57.071 --> 1:02:00.373
Well, we met after
I was discharged.

1:02:00.505 --> 1:02:02.171
It was a long time ago.

1:02:04.805 --> 1:02:06.906
Did you know
that she died?

1:02:08.406 --> 1:02:10.006
No.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:15.173
I mean, we tried to
make it work, you know?

1:02:15.307 --> 1:02:17.039
But it was complicated.

1:02:19.873 --> 1:02:22.406
Are you saying you
slept with my mother?

1:02:22.539 --> 1:02:24.072
No, it was...

1:02:26.406 --> 1:02:28.406
It was more than
that, Peyton.

1:02:28.539 --> 1:02:30.073
What do you mean?

1:02:30.740 --> 1:02:33.140
I mean,
I can't be sure, but...

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:40.607
No.

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.007
It's not you.

1:02:45.308 --> 1:02:47.674
So then you know
who your dad is?

1:02:48.908 --> 1:02:50.474
Do you?

1:02:53.607 --> 1:02:57.707
Well, I got a friend
looking into it, so.

1:02:59.774 --> 1:03:02.541
She said he was
a good man.

1:03:04.074 --> 1:03:05.575
It's not you.

1:03:13.508 --> 1:03:15.942
Well, either way,
we're going to Argentina.

1:03:30.343 --> 1:03:32.042
Whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy!

1:03:32.176 --> 1:03:33.876
<i>It's me, it's just me!</i>

1:03:36.542 --> 1:03:38.110
What are you doing here?

1:03:38.776 --> 1:03:40.343
It's been a long day, okay?

1:03:40.476 --> 1:03:42.542
Please, please.

1:03:45.211 --> 1:03:46.410
- Peyton.
- What?

1:03:46.542 --> 1:03:47.910
It's okay.

1:03:48.177 --> 1:03:50.443
<i>Hey, sorry about
that, yeah, with the-</i>

1:03:51.076 --> 1:03:52.743
Um, I'm Eli.

1:03:54.378 --> 1:03:55.910
Nice to-

1:03:56.543 --> 1:03:57.943
I got what you wanted.

1:03:58.077 --> 1:03:59.744
- Come in.
- Yeah.

1:04:01.077 --> 1:04:02.410
You stay here.

1:04:02.777 --> 1:04:04.244
<i>You don't move.</i>

1:04:04.378 --> 1:04:05.877
I mean it.

1:04:14.345 --> 1:04:17.044
<i>Swanson hasn't
made good contact with the ball,</i>

1:04:17.178 --> 1:04:18.145
<i>and is just at the-</i>

1:04:20.544 --> 1:04:21.645
What the hell happened
to your face?

1:04:21.778 --> 1:04:23.945
What, oh, Palmer,
that's what.

1:04:24.078 --> 1:04:26.078
Yeah, he, uh, somehow
he found the gas guy.

1:04:26.212 --> 1:04:28.778
He came to my house but I gave
him an address in Hillsdale.

1:04:28.912 --> 1:04:30.046
Are you sure you're
not followed?

1:04:30.179 --> 1:04:31.279
There's no way,
there's no way.

1:04:31.411 --> 1:04:32.678
It was too long of a ride,

1:04:32.811 --> 1:04:34.046
I would've-I would've
made him for sure.

1:04:34.179 --> 1:04:35.645
That's one guy you
don't want on your tail.

1:04:35.778 --> 1:04:36.912
You're positive, right?

1:04:37.046 --> 1:04:38.380
'Cause we're
sittin' ducks here.

1:04:38.512 --> 1:04:39.878
Yes. Yes, let's get
this done, okay?

1:04:40.012 --> 1:04:42.146
Let's, you can fly the
coop for good this time

1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.412
and get outta here.

1:04:43.545 --> 1:04:44.445
I wanna get
outta this shithole.

1:04:44.579 --> 1:04:45.412
Yeah, no kidding,
this is-

1:04:45.545 --> 1:04:46.879
this is a safe house?

1:04:47.012 --> 1:04:49.646
<i>Yeah, I-I grossly
overpaid for this.</i>

1:04:54.579 --> 1:04:57.180
Trucking? Trucking, huh?

1:04:57.313 --> 1:04:58.314
Yeah, no, I-

1:04:58.445 --> 1:05:00.047
I can see that.

1:05:00.180 --> 1:05:03.480
Well, I had a real nice semi
picked out for me up in Alaska.

1:05:03.612 --> 1:05:06.347
But, you know,
change of plans.

1:05:07.114 --> 1:05:10.014
Yeah, uh, here,
I got some, uh,

1:05:11.014 --> 1:05:13.413
I got some bad
news for ya, man.

1:05:14.014 --> 1:05:15.214
What?

1:05:15.347 --> 1:05:19.446
Okay, your new name,
it's, uh, Lester Kaplowski.

1:05:19.580 --> 1:05:23.580
Sorry man,
it's out of my hands.

1:05:24.115 --> 1:05:27.315
<i>Here, I didn't-I
didn't pick it.</i>

1:05:28.613 --> 1:05:29.713
I appreciate it.

1:05:29.847 --> 1:05:30.980
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

1:05:31.115 --> 1:05:32.780
<i>What-what's,
what's this?</i>

1:05:34.215 --> 1:05:35.481
I haven't slept, so.

1:05:35.614 --> 1:05:36.681
Well, that's understandable.

1:05:36.814 --> 1:05:38.714
And the girl's
a handful, so.

1:05:39.614 --> 1:05:41.814
<i>On a tear, zero-</i>

1:05:42.215 --> 1:05:43.215
She's a good-looking kid.

1:05:43.348 --> 1:05:44.514
- Hey!
- What?

1:05:44.648 --> 1:05:46.414
Take it easy.

1:05:47.581 --> 1:05:49.116
<i>Here.</i>

1:05:49.614 --> 1:05:51.116
<i>What?</i>

1:05:52.049 --> 1:05:53.982
It's for the
other passport.

1:05:55.582 --> 1:05:58.082
So, uh, so you decided.

1:05:58.216 --> 1:05:59.582
Mmm hmm.

1:05:59.749 --> 1:06:01.482
So, you-you're not
even gonna ask me?

1:06:01.615 --> 1:06:03.515
Doesn't matter now.

1:06:04.849 --> 1:06:06.849
You can't be
serious, man, you-

1:06:06.983 --> 1:06:08.916
<i>you put all of our
lives on the line,</i>

1:06:09.050 --> 1:06:11.349
for-for-for what then?
For what?

1:06:11.482 --> 1:06:12.482
For what you just
put in your pocket.

1:06:12.615 --> 1:06:14.250
Okay, no,
you should know-

1:06:14.384 --> 1:06:15.615
I should know what?

1:06:15.749 --> 1:06:16.916
Drop it!
Okay, let's go.

1:06:17.050 --> 1:06:18.516
No, okay, well,
fuck it, fuck it.

1:06:18.649 --> 1:06:21.083
Congratulations.
You're not a father.

1:06:22.284 --> 1:06:23.650
Whoa, hey, buddy, buddy!

1:06:23.783 --> 1:06:25.017
I said don't tell me!

1:06:25.150 --> 1:06:26.883
Hey, what is happening
here right now?

1:06:27.017 --> 1:06:28.883
I thought that
was a good thing!

1:06:29.384 --> 1:06:30.883
<i>Jesus.</i>

1:06:34.816 --> 1:06:38.549
Forget about the girl,
get outta here.

1:06:38.683 --> 1:06:40.616
Make this a happy ending.

1:06:43.018 --> 1:06:44.584
I'm taking her.

1:06:46.385 --> 1:06:47.417
Fine.

1:06:47.550 --> 1:06:49.118
Fine, whatever.

1:06:50.251 --> 1:06:51.784
Just don't understand why,

1:06:51.919 --> 1:06:54.617
why you're so attached
to somebody else's kid.

1:06:55.151 --> 1:06:56.717
We're not attached.

1:06:57.085 --> 1:06:58.617
<i>She hates me.</i>

1:07:08.152 --> 1:07:09.386
What's going on?

1:07:09.518 --> 1:07:10.952
Who is that guy?

1:07:11.085 --> 1:07:12.851
<i>He's an old friend.</i>

1:07:13.952 --> 1:07:15.886
<i>We're going with him.</i>

1:07:17.052 --> 1:07:18.119
Put this on
your forehead.

1:07:18.252 --> 1:07:19.252
Why?

1:07:19.386 --> 1:07:20.418
'Cause you're not well.

1:07:20.551 --> 1:07:21.418
Just do it.

1:07:21.551 --> 1:07:22.953
Stop!

1:07:23.086 --> 1:07:25.986
I can see your fever
from here, please.

1:07:36.519 --> 1:07:37.852
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

1:07:37.986 --> 1:07:39.287
<i>After Sanku's
record-breaking night,</i>

1:07:39.419 --> 1:07:40.887
<i>Donald Swanson-</i>

1:07:42.086 --> 1:07:43.419
<i>So we can't
leave from Detroit</i>

1:07:43.552 --> 1:07:44.853
because there's too
much heat on us.

1:07:44.987 --> 1:07:46.552
Fine, fine, I'll get
you as far as Clarkson

1:07:46.686 --> 1:07:47.921
and then you guys are on
your own from there, okay?

1:07:48.054 --> 1:07:49.154
No, first we need to
go by a drugstore.

1:07:49.288 --> 1:07:50.452
But-
- I'm fine.

1:07:50.586 --> 1:07:52.187
You're not!

1:07:52.321 --> 1:07:53.619
We also need a
car in Clarkson.

1:07:53.753 --> 1:07:55.254
Right, right, okay.

1:07:55.388 --> 1:07:56.786
I'm gonna hook you up with
a car in Clarkson right now

1:07:56.921 --> 1:07:58.321
and let's go,
we'll go right now, okay?

1:07:58.453 --> 1:07:59.420
<i>How much?</i>

1:07:59.553 --> 1:08:00.453
No, preferred client discount.

1:08:00.587 --> 1:08:01.620
How much you want?

1:08:01.754 --> 1:08:03.021
I don't want anything,
keep it.

1:08:03.154 --> 1:08:04.820
You're gonna need it
when you get there.

1:08:10.587 --> 1:08:11.553
- Something's not right.
- Whoa.

1:08:11.687 --> 1:08:12.620
Oh, whoa, okay, okay.

1:08:12.754 --> 1:08:13.720
What are you doing?

1:08:13.855 --> 1:08:15.620
What are you doing-

1:08:16.289 --> 1:08:18.055
Keele! Keele?

1:08:18.188 --> 1:08:20.022
<i>Couple warmup
pitches as Derrick Graham-</i>

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:22.955
Did you set me up?

1:08:23.554 --> 1:08:25.155
After all I've
done for you.

1:08:25.289 --> 1:08:27.488
After all we've been through
together, you're not-

1:08:28.122 --> 1:08:30.022
<i>Are you really asking
me that question?</i>

1:08:30.155 --> 1:08:32.488
You've never done a
favour in your life.

1:08:37.389 --> 1:08:38.355
Okay.

1:08:38.488 --> 1:08:40.056
Don't move.

1:08:43.056 --> 1:08:44.588
No, no.

1:08:50.889 --> 1:08:52.056
<i>Oh, fuck, Eli.</i>

1:08:53.189 --> 1:08:54.555
You could've got out.

1:08:54.689 --> 1:08:56.056
You had a chance to get
out and you didn't go

1:08:56.189 --> 1:08:58.189
<i>and that's on you,
man, that's on you!</i>

1:08:59.124 --> 1:09:02.190
Okay, why did you get
me involved in this

1:09:02.323 --> 1:09:04.324
<i>in the first place?
You pulled me into this!</i>

1:09:04.455 --> 1:09:06.924
I was getting a good clean
business going on my own.

1:09:07.057 --> 1:09:09.157
You were never clean
in your life, Eli.

1:09:09.291 --> 1:09:10.890
Cleanish, cleanish!

1:09:11.024 --> 1:09:12.523
You weren't there, okay,
you didn't see him.

1:09:12.657 --> 1:09:13.857
You didn't see him,
this guy was crazy.

1:09:13.990 --> 1:09:14.957
This guy's crazy!

1:09:15.090 --> 1:09:16.523
<i>And not-not-not
regular crazy,</i>

1:09:16.657 --> 1:09:17.824
it's like calm crazy.

1:09:17.957 --> 1:09:18.990
It's like the worst
kind of crazy.

1:09:19.124 --> 1:09:20.590
How much does he know?

1:09:21.224 --> 1:09:22.324
He knows everything, man.

1:09:22.456 --> 1:09:23.958
He knows everything,
all right?

1:09:24.091 --> 1:09:25.690
<i>He knows about the stash,
he knows about the girl</i>

1:09:25.824 --> 1:09:27.758
and your passports.

1:09:27.891 --> 1:09:29.025
<i>And-and-and he's
waiting out there</i>

1:09:29.158 --> 1:09:30.523
<i>and I'm supposed
to walk you out.</i>

1:09:30.657 --> 1:09:31.824
I'm supposed to
walk you out

1:09:31.958 --> 1:09:32.991
and then he's gonna
finish you off

1:09:33.125 --> 1:09:34.392
but there's two of us

1:09:34.524 --> 1:09:35.791
and there's one of him.

1:09:35.925 --> 1:09:36.925
There's only one of him,
and if we work together,

1:09:37.058 --> 1:09:38.658
if we work
together on this,

1:09:38.791 --> 1:09:40.058
we can get outta here.

1:09:40.191 --> 1:09:41.524
<i>Hey, man,
it wasn't for nothing,</i>

1:09:41.658 --> 1:09:42.691
<i>it wasn't for nothing, okay?</i>

1:09:42.825 --> 1:09:44.658
He was gonna kill Myra,

1:09:44.792 --> 1:09:46.524
gonna kill her, okay?

1:09:46.658 --> 1:09:48.191
<i>And then-then-then-then,</i>

1:09:48.325 --> 1:09:49.457
what am I supposed to do?

1:09:49.591 --> 1:09:51.226
<i>You woulda done
the same thing,</i>

1:09:51.358 --> 1:09:52.259
<i>you woulda done the same,
what are you gonna kill me?</i>

1:09:52.392 --> 1:09:53.259
Come on, man.

1:09:53.392 --> 1:09:54.259
You gonna kill me, Keele?

1:09:54.393 --> 1:09:55.259
You gonna kill me?

1:09:55.393 --> 1:09:56.425
You're not gonna kill me.

1:09:56.557 --> 1:09:57.992
You're not an asshole,
are you?

1:09:58.126 --> 1:09:59.658
I'm not an asshole.

1:10:00.525 --> 1:10:02.592
I'm sorry, man, okay?

1:10:05.692 --> 1:10:07.458
I'm sorry too.

1:10:12.159 --> 1:10:13.726
<i>The ball is
launched into the outfield-</i>

1:10:50.194 --> 1:10:51.695
Let's just go.

1:10:52.661 --> 1:10:54.828
Wherever you wanna go,
I'll go.

1:10:55.627 --> 1:10:57.962
We getting outta here
right now, come on.

1:11:02.728 --> 1:11:04.427
We're going out back.

1:11:05.427 --> 1:11:06.962
Wait here.

1:11:26.930 --> 1:11:28.696
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

1:11:45.931 --> 1:11:48.330
You said Eli was a friend.

1:11:48.462 --> 1:11:49.997
He was.

1:11:50.330 --> 1:11:51.997
But even friends can turn.

1:11:54.562 --> 1:11:56.596
Wait, here.

1:11:57.097 --> 1:11:58.398
Take this.

1:11:58.529 --> 1:12:00.430
I saved it for you.

1:12:14.398 --> 1:12:16.898
Okay, we gotta
get outta here.

1:12:17.398 --> 1:12:19.065
Gotta get to Eli's car.

1:12:20.032 --> 1:12:23.032
Take this and don't
shoot me with it.

1:12:23.165 --> 1:12:25.898
But, but I don't
know how to use it!

1:12:26.365 --> 1:12:27.798
There's nothing to it.

1:12:27.932 --> 1:12:29.232
You just point it where you
want the bullet to go.

1:12:29.365 --> 1:12:30.265
All right?

1:12:30.399 --> 1:12:31.365
You ready?

1:12:31.498 --> 1:12:34.098
No!

1:12:34.232 --> 1:12:35.933
<i>You fucked up, old man.</i>

1:12:39.299 --> 1:12:40.399
<i>You had one job!</i>

1:12:41.531 --> 1:12:43.066
AH!

1:12:46.732 --> 1:12:48.465
All right, take this!

1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:50.465
You're gonna
get in the car-

1:12:50.599 --> 1:12:51.366
What? No.
- And you're gonna go.

1:12:51.499 --> 1:12:52.766
- No!
- Yes.

1:12:52.899 --> 1:12:53.966
No, I can't, I don't
know what I'm doing.

1:12:54.099 --> 1:12:55.700
Yes, you're gonna
go right now.

1:12:55.832 --> 1:12:57.300
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- It's not me, okay?

1:12:57.432 --> 1:12:58.532
What?

1:12:58.667 --> 1:13:00.199
Eli told me.

1:13:02.566 --> 1:13:03.867
Fuck you!

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.300
Think about getting
out of here right now

1:13:05.432 --> 1:13:06.465
and that's it,
now let's move!

1:13:07.867 --> 1:13:08.566
<i>Nowhere to hide, Keele!</i>

1:13:08.700 --> 1:13:09.432
Look at me!

1:13:09.566 --> 1:13:10.867
<i>It okay.</i>

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.067
Go, go!

1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:13.367
All right.

1:13:25.034 --> 1:13:27.433
<i>Come get me,
you fuckin' psycho!</i>

1:15:29.406 --> 1:15:30.539
Don't move.

1:15:39.539 --> 1:15:41.206
Yeah, I learned
all your tricks.

1:15:49.573 --> 1:15:51.140
What a waste.

1:15:51.273 --> 1:15:53.106
<i>You didn't learn this one,
you little prick.</i>

1:16:04.207 --> 1:16:06.441
Ah, not bad.

1:16:08.041 --> 1:16:10.774
I can't wait to get
acquainted with your girl.

1:16:11.508 --> 1:16:13.641
I'll be able to use this to
chop her fuckin' head off.

1:16:27.741 --> 1:16:29.475
<i>Rest easy, old man.</i>

1:16:30.008 --> 1:16:31.841
<i>I'll take good
care of her.</i>

1:16:34.042 --> 1:16:36.442
<i>Oh, shit, you bitch!</i>

1:16:54.742 --> 1:16:56.109
So you're his girl?

1:16:56.243 --> 1:16:57.809
Shut up!

1:16:59.876 --> 1:17:01.743
<i>Hey, Peyton.</i>

1:17:04.209 --> 1:17:05.810
You don't wanna do that.

1:17:05.944 --> 1:17:07.476
<i>Peyton.</i>

1:17:08.777 --> 1:17:10.243
<i>Listen to me, okay?</i>

1:17:11.377 --> 1:17:13.010
You can't undo it.

1:17:13.910 --> 1:17:15.210
He gets what he deserves.

1:17:15.345 --> 1:17:17.210
Hey, listen to me for once!

1:17:18.643 --> 1:17:22.144
That will stick
with you forever.

1:17:23.777 --> 1:17:26.010
You should listen
to the old man.

1:17:26.910 --> 1:17:28.477
Peyton?

1:17:30.844 --> 1:17:32.911
You don't wanna
be like me.

1:17:35.145 --> 1:17:36.644
Gimme the gun.

1:17:44.145 --> 1:17:45.145
No!

1:18:10.179 --> 1:18:11.912
I told you to go.

1:18:59.349 --> 1:19:00.914
Okay.

1:19:08.782 --> 1:19:10.581
I'm okay, I got it.

1:19:10.715 --> 1:19:12.448
Are you sure?

1:19:14.581 --> 1:19:16.115
Well, maybe a little help.

1:19:35.050 --> 1:19:38.250
So, James, how do we
get to Argentina?

1:19:38.683 --> 1:19:40.816
Now you wanna go?

1:19:40.950 --> 1:19:42.083
Of course.

1:19:42.318 --> 1:19:44.649
I've always wanted
to go to Argentina.

1:19:44.783 --> 1:19:46.284
You said you didn't.

1:19:47.050 --> 1:19:49.116
Well, I didn't want
to go with you.

1:19:50.384 --> 1:19:51.950
You do now?

1:19:53.251 --> 1:19:54.817
Yeah.

1:19:57.384 --> 1:19:59.116
But I still hate you.

1:20:00.617 --> 1:20:02.152
I know.

1:20:03.284 --> 1:20:04.418
<i>What about Alaska?</i>

1:20:04.550 --> 1:20:05.917
<i>I hear it's peaceful and-</i>

1:20:06.218 --> 1:20:08.517
<i>You just promised Argentina.</i>

1:20:08.650 --> 1:20:09.917
<i>All right, forget it.</i>

1:20:10.051 --> 1:20:11.917
<i>You know how to
drive, right?</i>

1:20:12.385 --> 1:20:13.352
<i>Ahhhh, yeah.</i>

1:20:13.484 --> 1:20:14.984
<i>Holy Jesus.</i>

1:20:18.419 --> 1:20:20.419
<i>Ugh, this music.</i>
