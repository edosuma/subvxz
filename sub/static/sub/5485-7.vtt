00:00.075 --> 00:01.929
<i>Previously on
The Bastard Executioner...</i>

00:02.009 --> 00:04.577
Blessed news.
Lady Love is with child.

00:04.611 --> 00:05.745
(murmuring happily)

00:05.779 --> 00:07.446
<i>The baron's parting gift--</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.381
<i>an heir at Ventrishire.</i>

00:09.416 --> 00:11.918
That woman
is not with child.

00:11.952 --> 00:13.419
LADY LOVE:
<i>Nearly two weeks of thought</i>

00:13.453 --> 00:14.820
has given me no better sense

00:14.855 --> 00:17.023
of how to carry out
my deception.

00:17.057 --> 00:19.258
Our shires deserve
the fruits

00:19.292 --> 00:20.726
<i>of a greater tree.</i>

00:20.761 --> 00:22.061
<i>And Lady Love is a widow</i>

00:22.095 --> 00:24.263
and her rule is in the hands
of a frivolous king.

00:24.297 --> 00:25.731
PRYCE:
<i>You are quite aware</i>

00:25.766 --> 00:27.066
<i>that I'm already married?</i>

00:27.100 --> 00:28.233
<i>My wife may well return</i>

00:28.268 --> 00:29.134
to good health.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.103
Of course, one could only hope.

00:32.472 --> 00:34.040
PRYCE: You knew she
was in that wagon!

00:34.074 --> 00:36.442
CORBETT: <i>I promised Baron
Pryce swift justice</i>

00:36.476 --> 00:39.311
in the trial and punishment
of this godless murderer.

00:39.345 --> 00:41.746
The baron claims
that the guilty man

00:41.781 --> 00:43.415
was under orders of the Wolf.

00:43.450 --> 00:45.284
I am not your husband.

00:45.318 --> 00:47.286
Nor am I
an executioner.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.854
Corbett holds that secret
over my head.

00:49.889 --> 00:51.623
Threatens the lives
of all of you

00:51.657 --> 00:52.958
if I do not willingly

00:52.992 --> 00:54.659
- commit his sins.
- You commit no sins,

00:54.694 --> 00:55.660
Maddy.

00:55.695 --> 00:57.563
All I do is commit sin.

00:57.597 --> 00:58.630
CORBETT:
Sir Norton.

00:59.932 --> 01:01.266
He is my offering.

01:01.301 --> 01:03.302
Torture him. Kill him.

01:03.336 --> 01:05.804
Your wrath will not touch

01:05.838 --> 01:07.072
our reeve or any
of his other men.

01:07.107 --> 01:08.840
You are well aware

01:08.874 --> 01:10.642
of the consequences

01:10.676 --> 01:11.676
<i>if you turn against that.</i>

01:11.711 --> 01:12.677
Do not stop me!

01:12.712 --> 01:14.413
TORAN:
<i>This knight, he knows</i>

01:14.447 --> 01:15.747
of the man who killed my Eva.

01:15.781 --> 01:16.915
I need to take that from him.

01:16.949 --> 01:19.618
If we are to be crushed
under Corbett's thumb,

01:19.652 --> 01:22.520
at least give me the relief

01:22.554 --> 01:23.822
of knowing who
took her life.

02:53.812 --> 02:57.647
I'm struggling
sitting still with God.

03:09.094 --> 03:10.861
I twist with guilt,

03:10.895 --> 03:13.197
knowing I caused that struggle.

03:13.231 --> 03:16.934
The twist is mine,
brother.

03:16.968 --> 03:19.970
I've earned the blood

What of the blood
yet to spill?

03:24.174 --> 03:25.808

03:25.843 --> 03:28.911
Locke, Denley and the reeve

03:28.946 --> 03:30.580
complete our vengeance.

And with that...

03:34.685 --> 03:37.420
tortured reveal

03:37.455 --> 03:40.323
comes the truth
of Corbett's screws.

03:42.426 --> 03:45.262
I needed to find a way out
from under his screws

03:45.296 --> 03:46.763
before he took them to you.

03:46.797 --> 03:47.797
Yea.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.169
Is that why you make an effort
to get close to our baroness?

03:56.106 --> 03:57.774
I see it,
brother.

03:57.808 --> 03:59.541
As do others.

03:59.576 --> 04:01.610
I am but a curiosity
to Lady Love.

04:01.645 --> 04:03.479
There is no effort
to get close.

04:03.513 --> 04:04.680
MAN:
Clear the way!

04:24.401 --> 04:28.137
Ah. Punisher.

04:28.172 --> 04:30.105
You need to ready
your stock and chains.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.674
This rebel must bear a death

04:32.708 --> 04:34.109
most agonizing.

04:35.577 --> 04:37.946
For what crime
is he guilty?

04:37.980 --> 04:39.047
CORBETT:
One most heinous.

04:41.217 --> 04:43.618
While the baroness of Pryceshire

04:43.652 --> 04:47.122
traveled to the salt springs
for a cure,

04:47.156 --> 04:49.157
he ambushed her caravan.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.327
Killed her men.

04:53.930 --> 04:55.931
Set her wagon on fire.

05:00.369 --> 05:02.337
Burned Lady Trula alive.

06:54.125 --> 06:57.161
Isabelle has prepared Erik's
winter salon for Baron Pryce.

06:57.162 --> 06:58.662
That should
be suitable.

06:58.697 --> 07:00.731
Yes. Most suitable,
my lady.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.103
Such a sad play
of circumstances.

07:07.706 --> 07:10.006
Baron Pryce, now without spouse,

07:10.041 --> 07:12.209
will find comfort in a room

07:12.243 --> 07:15.345
that gave our dear
departed baron such joy.

07:15.379 --> 07:17.914
You confuse eros

07:17.949 --> 07:19.615
with happiness,
good chamberlain.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.517
I know
the winter salon

07:21.552 --> 07:24.620
was where Erik
bedded his mistresses.

07:24.655 --> 07:26.990
I hope that is
not the comfort

07:27.024 --> 07:28.691
you propose we offer
Baron Pryce.

07:28.726 --> 07:31.328
No, Lady Love.

07:31.362 --> 07:34.697
I believe that Edwin Pryce
will only find comfort

07:34.732 --> 07:36.366
in a woman
whose beauty and grace

07:36.400 --> 07:39.970
are matched by her wit
and intellect.

07:44.075 --> 07:45.675
Our relations with Pryceshire

07:45.709 --> 07:47.910
have become
increasingly strained.

07:47.944 --> 07:50.880
As would any relation
where trust and fairness

07:50.914 --> 07:54.083
have been
stripped away.

07:54.117 --> 07:57.019
Perhaps
God shines a ray of sunlight

07:57.053 --> 08:00.289
on this darkness, my lady.

08:00.323 --> 08:02.291
An opportunity
for Pryceshire

08:02.325 --> 08:04.193
and Ventrishire
to unite

08:04.227 --> 08:06.662
- in the execution of justice.
- (screaming)

08:06.697 --> 08:09.265
(man gasping)

08:09.299 --> 08:10.733
Halt.

08:12.369 --> 08:15.872
The baroness would like
to speak to this prisoner.

08:15.906 --> 08:18.207
(gasping)

08:18.241 --> 08:22.378
I do not know what more this
rebel can tell you, my lady.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.179
His confession
is complete

08:24.214 --> 08:27.383
and binds him to his fate.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.887
Thank you, good chamberlain.

08:53.109 --> 08:56.778
I have read your confession,
Berwyn Cairn.

08:58.681 --> 08:59.981
Although it's exact

09:00.015 --> 09:02.784
in the retelling
of the horror,

09:02.819 --> 09:05.487
I am having difficulty
understanding your loyalty.

09:05.521 --> 09:07.589
My loyalty is
to the Byth Encil.

09:09.492 --> 09:13.027
That is my confusion.

09:13.062 --> 09:14.529
You refuse to give the names

09:14.564 --> 09:16.297
of the rebels
who were at your side,

09:16.332 --> 09:19.067
yet willingly condemn
your leader

09:19.101 --> 09:21.803
as the one
who demanded the murder.

09:21.838 --> 09:23.472
Is not your loyalty backwards?

09:23.506 --> 09:26.274
A good soldier
protects his commander.

09:26.308 --> 09:29.644
The Wolf is...

09:29.679 --> 09:30.979
he is not concerned

09:31.013 --> 09:33.014
with protection.

09:35.351 --> 09:38.186
You heard this command
for murder from his lips?

09:40.356 --> 09:41.356
Yea.

09:44.026 --> 09:46.027
I see.

09:48.063 --> 09:50.331
I hear he is a beast of a man.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.602
Thick-waisted,
red-bearded

09:54.636 --> 09:57.538
and ruddy.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.309
Yea.

10:01.343 --> 10:04.312
A large, hard-looking man.

10:07.915 --> 10:09.483
(crying quietly)

10:20.061 --> 10:22.095
Did you hear
what you needed, my lady?

10:22.130 --> 10:23.563
Yes.

10:23.597 --> 10:26.866
Tell me, Master Gawain,
what would possess a man

10:26.901 --> 10:28.535
to tell a lie that seals a fate

10:28.569 --> 10:30.303
of a certain and awful death?

10:33.074 --> 10:35.675
(panting, whimpering)

10:35.709 --> 10:37.710
The prisoner did not
commit this crime.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.416
Frightened men
tell desperate tales.

10:45.185 --> 10:47.754
What is the man afraid of?

10:49.557 --> 10:52.659
What all liars fear, Baroness.

10:52.693 --> 10:56.563
The truth and
its responsibility.

10:56.597 --> 10:59.933
Is not the weight of the untruth
a greater burden?

10:59.967 --> 11:01.267
Always.

11:01.301 --> 11:04.771
But a weight
that some shoulders bear well

11:04.805 --> 11:10.077
and some even feel uneven
without.

11:11.945 --> 11:13.845
That is very sad.

11:15.648 --> 11:18.284
Thank you for that insight,
Master Gawain.

11:32.065 --> 11:34.066
(panting)

11:46.679 --> 11:48.947
Marshal.

11:59.759 --> 12:00.759
What need?

12:00.793 --> 12:02.628
A scout brings news
of a rebel camp

12:02.662 --> 12:03.962
west of the marsh.

12:03.997 --> 12:05.597
With Norton
and Huxley still away

12:05.632 --> 12:07.099
on the chamberlain's duties,

12:07.133 --> 12:10.135
we need another
able body.

12:10.169 --> 12:11.302
The attack on Lady
Trula rattles nerves

12:11.337 --> 12:12.470
on both sides
of the marshes.

12:12.505 --> 12:15.706
The rebel threat
is to be crushed

12:15.741 --> 12:17.275
by any method,

12:17.309 --> 12:20.578
above or below manor law.

12:22.548 --> 12:24.182
A mission with no decree.

12:24.216 --> 12:25.183
LOCKE:
Yea.

12:25.217 --> 12:26.884
With the spoils of the hunt

12:26.918 --> 12:28.453
shared by all.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.488
LEON: Can we count
on your blade?

12:33.259 --> 12:35.493
Yea.

12:37.530 --> 12:39.531
(door opens)

12:40.599 --> 12:42.466
Maddox.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.468
I am told you need
more suitable gear.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.836
(door closes)

12:47.539 --> 12:50.074
My stocks and chains
are sufficient.

12:50.108 --> 12:52.609
It is a guilty victim I require.

12:52.644 --> 12:55.946
We both know this is a crime
in need of swift punishment.

12:58.349 --> 13:00.017
Berwyn Cairn.

13:00.052 --> 13:01.451
A wife.

13:01.486 --> 13:02.586
Two sons.

13:02.620 --> 13:03.654
Two younger ones, dead.

13:03.689 --> 13:05.022
Starvation.

13:05.057 --> 13:06.890
His rye fields
turned to swamp

13:06.924 --> 13:08.224
by summer flood,

13:08.258 --> 13:11.294
a debt that will take
three generations to clear.

13:11.328 --> 13:15.131
This is a writ of payment
from Baron Pryce.

13:15.166 --> 13:18.201
It clears all
of Cairn's debts.

13:18.235 --> 13:21.738
This is a letter from me
to our steward,

13:21.772 --> 13:24.841
securing his wife
and boys

13:24.875 --> 13:26.810
positions and shelter

13:26.844 --> 13:29.245
here at Castle Ventris.

13:29.279 --> 13:32.749
You used his life as currency?

13:32.783 --> 13:34.084
He was on
his way

13:34.118 --> 13:35.684
to debtor's prison.

13:35.719 --> 13:38.553
His family, a few days away
from a hungry death.

13:38.588 --> 13:40.823
We offered him
salvation

13:40.857 --> 13:42.858
and he gladly
accepted.

13:44.794 --> 13:47.295
A murder conspired by greed.

13:47.330 --> 13:49.331
Executed by the ignorant.

13:51.467 --> 13:55.204
I know you think of me
as a simple demon,

13:55.238 --> 13:58.941
but you know a mere
glimpse of me, Wilkin.

13:58.975 --> 14:01.610
I have lived many hard lives.

14:01.644 --> 14:03.678
And I survived by seeing
the shadow of the axe

14:03.713 --> 14:05.714
before it falls.

14:08.251 --> 14:10.518
Everything I have done
since Erik's death,

14:10.553 --> 14:12.554
I do to protect this shire.

14:14.390 --> 14:17.492
And yes, the benefits
fall to my favor.

14:19.729 --> 14:21.363
But they also fall to the favor

14:21.397 --> 14:23.064
of the one you care for most.

14:24.099 --> 14:26.301
Lady Love.

14:26.335 --> 14:28.769
(door opens)

14:30.238 --> 14:32.139
Forgive me,
Chamberlain.

14:32.173 --> 14:33.574
The punisher's
soldier and I

14:33.608 --> 14:36.143
need a word with him,
when you are finished.

14:36.177 --> 14:39.780
I think we are finished,
are we not, Maddox?

15:03.674 --> 15:05.108
Are you the strangers
in servitude?

15:06.143 --> 15:07.711
If not,
these are the heaviest hides

15:07.745 --> 15:09.512
ever to wrap my feet.

15:09.546 --> 15:11.181
Yea, and the loudest.

15:11.215 --> 15:12.648
Are you in want of hog or...

15:12.683 --> 15:14.984
Remove their chains.
Archdeacon's request.

15:25.729 --> 15:27.196
What's an "arshateeken"?

15:27.231 --> 15:30.333
Something we don't need.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.090
Pardon, scribe.

15:56.092 --> 15:57.826
Baroness.

15:57.861 --> 15:59.594
(chains rattle)

16:01.965 --> 16:03.932
Indentured scribe, my lady.

16:03.967 --> 16:05.533
I would like to see

16:05.568 --> 16:07.870
any records,
testimony or accounts

16:07.904 --> 16:10.505
we may have on this family name
in Ventrishire.

16:10.539 --> 16:13.608
Baroness, please,
let me be of service?

16:15.745 --> 16:18.413
Not of nobility.

16:20.115 --> 16:21.382
Perhaps some land deeds

16:21.416 --> 16:22.516
or receipts, my lady.

16:22.550 --> 16:24.185
Gather what you can find.

16:24.219 --> 16:25.419
With haste.

16:25.453 --> 16:27.388
Yes, Baroness.

16:28.891 --> 16:29.957
Good day, Moor.

16:29.992 --> 16:31.993
Baroness.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.201
(door closes)

16:40.235 --> 16:42.503
Is there a service you require?

16:52.113 --> 16:53.781
Sir.

16:53.815 --> 16:57.384
Why is that you bring
these men to my chapel?

16:57.419 --> 16:59.219
Sorry, priest.

16:59.253 --> 17:01.888
What is it that demands
such secrecy?

17:01.923 --> 17:04.257
Not your concern.

17:04.291 --> 17:07.428
If it concerns my congregation,
it concerns me.

17:08.430 --> 17:09.663
Let me pass.

17:11.866 --> 17:13.666
Will it not be a greater concern

17:13.702 --> 17:16.303
if your flock were
to lose its shepherd?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.475
(groans)

18:04.751 --> 18:07.253
(ripping)

18:09.019 --> 18:14.348
_

18:26.606 --> 18:29.073
The brands
of different shires.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.709
Pilfered, no doubt.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.677
These people are nomads,
not rebels.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.047
The Wolf enlists
any deprived soul ready

18:36.081 --> 18:37.916
to throw a rock
for his cause.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.119
This is my charge,
punisher.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.021
You are here only at
the beseech of Marshal.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.522
TORAN:
He's right, Reeve.

18:44.556 --> 18:45.990
If this were a rebel camp,

18:46.025 --> 18:48.393
we would have heard clicks
and whistles a mile back.

18:48.427 --> 18:52.030
And by this mark,
we'd all be pinned with arrows.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.264
Search the shelters.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.601
Find the men.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.182
(baby crying)

19:45.349 --> 19:47.183
Wench attacked with a blade.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.688
Daffodil and dagger draped
upon her bounty.

19:57.995 --> 20:00.662
(thunder rumbling)

20:09.538 --> 20:10.872
(bellowing)

20:16.545 --> 20:18.146
(grunting)

20:18.180 --> 20:20.048
(horses whinnying)

20:41.403 --> 20:42.403
(grunting continues)

21:11.399 --> 21:12.598
There can be no witness.

21:21.575 --> 21:23.042
Hold.

21:25.112 --> 21:26.546
There's been enough butchery.

21:26.580 --> 21:27.613
The rebel?

21:27.647 --> 21:28.714
Moves like a ghost.

21:28.748 --> 21:31.250
Lost in the rocks.

21:31.285 --> 21:33.052
Hyah!

21:42.929 --> 21:45.931
Hyah.

21:49.168 --> 21:50.569
(grunting)

22:10.890 --> 22:13.058
Another guilty one dies.

22:13.093 --> 22:14.994
Another of Leon's men.

22:15.028 --> 22:17.596
Our chamberlain will think
this was our brutal blade.

22:17.631 --> 22:19.765
But the reeve,
he will attest to...

22:19.799 --> 22:21.199
Leon didn't see it.

22:21.234 --> 22:23.235
And Corbett
will only see betrayal.

22:42.834 --> 22:44.235
Take the goods to the side gate.

22:44.270 --> 22:45.537
The peddler should
be waiting.

22:45.571 --> 22:46.804
Reeve, I need
our chamberlain's ear.

22:46.838 --> 22:47.905
The chamberlain
will be occupied

22:47.939 --> 22:49.707
with the duties of a host.

22:49.741 --> 22:52.076
Baron Pryce and his chancellor
arrived this evening.

22:52.110 --> 22:53.710
But as for our part

22:53.744 --> 22:55.011
in this rebel mission,

22:55.046 --> 22:56.413
I need to explain...

22:56.447 --> 22:58.315
There is nothing
to explain, punisher.

22:58.349 --> 23:00.284
We struck down a rebel camp

23:00.318 --> 23:03.220
and took the goods they use
to pay for their attacks

23:03.254 --> 23:05.389
and lost a good man in the task.

23:09.093 --> 23:11.161
Give them their piece.

23:13.097 --> 23:15.599
We want nothing of this.

23:17.268 --> 23:19.002
Then you'll have none.

23:37.221 --> 23:39.288
Do you think you can put enough
truth into Corbett's ear?

23:39.323 --> 23:41.324
Only God knows
what sways his heart.

23:41.358 --> 23:43.760
Until you convince
him Denley's death

23:43.794 --> 23:45.228
was not our retaliation,

23:45.262 --> 23:46.930
all those we love
are at risk.

23:46.964 --> 23:48.564
Yea.

23:48.599 --> 23:49.932
I can take watch
at the square.

23:49.966 --> 23:52.101
Watch my house
and the stockyard.

23:52.135 --> 23:53.736
I'll take guard
below the stacks.

23:53.770 --> 23:55.637
Make sure no one gets to Berber.

23:59.843 --> 24:01.844
(playing slow song)

24:34.977 --> 24:36.978
(song ends)

24:44.151 --> 24:47.220
It is an exquisite
instrument

24:47.254 --> 24:50.256
and such an extravagant
gift, dear baron.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.926
Hearing you play it, my lady,
clearly, the gift is all ours.

24:52.961 --> 24:54.461
(chuckles)

24:54.495 --> 24:56.630
The bowing of an angel.

24:56.664 --> 24:59.265
That kind of praise turns reason
to revelry, Chancellor.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.601
Let us not forget

25:00.635 --> 25:02.569
the sober reason we all gather.

25:02.604 --> 25:04.605
Indeed.

25:07.041 --> 25:08.475
May I share a revelation I had

25:08.509 --> 25:10.310
during my morning prayer,
Lady Love?

25:10.344 --> 25:12.679
Yes, please, Baron.

25:20.421 --> 25:22.388
Through the cold haze
of morning,

25:22.423 --> 25:25.825
I was struck by the warmth
of a bright beam of sunlight.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.161
In that moment,
I saw the higher purpose

25:28.195 --> 25:31.197
for all the tragedy
that has settled on us.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.701
It is God's desire
to melt away the years

25:35.736 --> 25:37.537
of ill will between our shires.

25:37.571 --> 25:40.273
That Pryceshire and Ventrishire
are to come together.

25:40.307 --> 25:43.376
And in that effort,
we become stronger, sounder

25:43.410 --> 25:47.113
and more pious
than we were individually.

25:47.148 --> 25:49.382
(chuckles)

25:53.987 --> 25:55.888
That is most profound,
dear baron.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.858
Although not as divinely
inspired as your vision,

25:59.892 --> 26:03.795
I, too, have been shown
the grace in this sadness.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.166
The opportunity
for us to govern in harmony.

26:08.568 --> 26:11.002
You from your magnificent,
gifted castle in Pryceshire.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.071
And myself

26:13.105 --> 26:15.740
from the humbler stones
laid by my ancestors,

26:15.775 --> 26:17.776
here in Ventrishire.

26:19.579 --> 26:22.581
And now, if you will
kindly excuse me, gentlemen.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.916
Tomorrow approaches with haste,

26:24.950 --> 26:27.319
and I do need my rest.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.420
Of course, my lady.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.655
Although you show
but a hint of it,

26:29.689 --> 26:31.657
we are all aware
you require the sleep of two.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.025
Yes.

26:34.060 --> 26:34.993
Good night, my lady.

26:45.370 --> 26:49.207
It seems you and the good baron
share a deep poetic connection.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.077
It is as if you are reading
each other's thoughts.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.880
And perhaps writing them down
and rehearsing them as well.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.280
♪

27:54.639 --> 27:56.640
♪

27:59.276 --> 28:00.643
Are you Master Gawain?

28:00.678 --> 28:01.945
Yea.

28:01.979 --> 28:03.513
We bring word
from the baroness.

28:03.547 --> 28:04.614
She needs your help.

28:04.648 --> 28:06.115
Most urgently, she said.

28:06.149 --> 28:07.383
She waits in her bed chamber.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.452
She was quite upset, crying.

28:09.487 --> 28:10.620
Why? What happened?

28:10.654 --> 28:13.389
We only know of
her needs, sir.

28:18.328 --> 28:20.329
Should we tell
her you refuse?

28:27.036 --> 28:29.505
Oh, I am certain
that you are quite lost.

28:29.539 --> 28:31.239
I was told the baroness
needed to see me.

28:31.273 --> 28:32.641
An urgent matter.

28:32.675 --> 28:34.009
By the sisters.

28:34.043 --> 28:35.176
The twin maidens.

28:35.211 --> 28:36.979
The twins?

28:37.013 --> 28:39.147
They do not tend
to the needs of my lady.

28:39.181 --> 28:40.549
I'm surprised
those giggle wenches

28:40.583 --> 28:42.584
aren't already warming
Corbett's bed.

28:43.586 --> 28:46.021
Who are you talking to, Isa...

28:46.055 --> 28:47.556
I am sorry.

28:50.026 --> 28:51.426
You should not be here,
Master Gawain.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.061
Yes. I have...

28:53.095 --> 28:55.230
He carries a message
for a Pryceshire noble, milady.

28:55.264 --> 28:56.731
I'll show him the way.

28:56.765 --> 28:58.365
My apologies, Baroness.

29:01.102 --> 29:03.103
(sighs)

29:33.400 --> 29:35.101
(door creaking)

29:40.975 --> 29:42.976
(sighs)

29:46.781 --> 29:49.683
Father, is all well?

29:49.717 --> 29:51.751
Yes.

29:51.786 --> 29:54.120
Will you put me to bed?

29:54.154 --> 29:55.989
(grunts)

30:22.749 --> 30:24.984
(grunts)

30:27.821 --> 30:29.421
What did I...?

30:29.455 --> 30:31.789
(shushing)

30:31.824 --> 30:34.459
Not yet.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.968
When I was nine...

30:44.003 --> 30:47.439
perhaps ten...

30:47.473 --> 30:50.742
this cleric that ran
the foundling's home--

30:50.776 --> 30:53.645
Darbone--

30:53.679 --> 30:56.981
he would teach us
piety and patience

30:57.016 --> 30:59.951
with a hot iron.

31:01.154 --> 31:03.388
It was very cruel.

31:03.422 --> 31:05.657
Very effective.

31:05.691 --> 31:06.958
Please...

31:06.992 --> 31:08.493
(shushing)

31:10.328 --> 31:12.429
At night...

31:12.464 --> 31:15.432
Darbone would visit us

31:15.467 --> 31:17.301
in the sleep hall.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.471
And choose from...

31:20.505 --> 31:23.107
20 or more boys.

31:25.044 --> 31:27.278
I was his favorite.

31:27.312 --> 31:29.280
Pretty

31:29.314 --> 31:32.884
and firm.

31:32.918 --> 31:35.219
And as he would

31:35.253 --> 31:37.488
tear his gnarled meat

31:37.522 --> 31:41.125
into my innocent bottom,

31:41.160 --> 31:45.063
do you know
what he would call me?

31:45.097 --> 31:47.832
His Little Lammy.

31:47.866 --> 31:50.633
Quite sweetly.

31:50.668 --> 31:52.669
Softly.

31:54.505 --> 31:56.506
Now...

31:59.276 --> 32:00.844
you,

32:00.878 --> 32:03.680
Little Lammy.

32:03.715 --> 32:06.016
Speak it--

32:06.050 --> 32:08.484
Little Lammy.

32:08.519 --> 32:10.520
(crying)

32:15.860 --> 32:19.730
Lit...

32:19.764 --> 32:21.531
Little Lammy.

32:21.565 --> 32:22.665
Yeah.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.601
Little Lammy.

32:24.635 --> 32:26.603
Keep speaking it.

32:26.637 --> 32:27.937
Little Lammy.

32:27.971 --> 32:29.472
Please.

32:29.506 --> 32:31.040
Little Lammy.

32:32.710 --> 32:35.345
(bleating nearby)

32:35.379 --> 32:37.380
(moaning nearby)

32:58.969 --> 33:00.702
Yea.

33:00.737 --> 33:03.239
Who goes there?

33:04.674 --> 33:06.242
ASH:
No!

33:06.276 --> 33:08.277
Calo, no!

33:09.913 --> 33:11.981
Oh!

33:22.458 --> 33:25.394
He got up to piss.

33:25.428 --> 33:26.995
I didn't hear a thing.

33:27.029 --> 33:29.030
(crying)

33:50.803 --> 33:54.138
The yard boss doesn't
remember killing Calo.

33:54.173 --> 33:57.241
And he never will.

33:57.276 --> 33:59.443
Just as the man awaiting
these will never

33:59.477 --> 34:01.112
be able to recall his crime.

34:09.387 --> 34:11.688
CORBETT: Make sure the villagers
stay clear of the pulling range.

34:15.793 --> 34:17.527
I am not a man
of idle threats.

34:17.562 --> 34:19.463
You, more than anyone,
should know that.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.967
We didn't kill Denley.

34:24.002 --> 34:26.136
TORAN:
It was nomads.

34:26.170 --> 34:28.304
Slavic bandits.

34:28.340 --> 34:31.708
I have no proof of that.

34:31.743 --> 34:33.510
A knight,
you were told not to harm,

34:33.545 --> 34:36.012
was found dead at your feet.

34:36.047 --> 34:38.815
You gave me no choice,
but to have to take

34:38.850 --> 34:40.951
a life in return.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.257
To your work, punisher.

35:03.807 --> 35:06.343
(grunting)

35:12.416 --> 35:15.085
Moor.

35:16.453 --> 35:18.288
I tried to speak to the others.

35:18.322 --> 35:20.656
They were afraid.

35:20.691 --> 35:21.757
Yes.

35:21.791 --> 35:25.160
What happened
in the chapel yesterday?

35:25.195 --> 35:26.996
Your archdeacon.

35:27.030 --> 35:30.232
He had us stripped
from neck to waist,

35:30.267 --> 35:31.833
looking for
heretical markings,

35:31.868 --> 35:34.036
burned with hue
into the skin.

35:34.070 --> 35:37.339
But no one among us had them.

35:37.374 --> 35:39.141
He splashed us with holy water

35:39.175 --> 35:41.576
and gave a harsh warning.

35:41.611 --> 35:45.381
And if we were to speak
of what happened,

35:45.415 --> 35:48.050
it could bring
the heretical marks

35:48.084 --> 35:49.651
to our skin.

35:49.685 --> 35:53.555
Why just you and a few others?

35:53.589 --> 35:56.124
No one among us had
any holdings of land

35:56.158 --> 35:58.993
or history of wages.

35:59.028 --> 36:02.964
Seems heretics keep no records.

36:02.998 --> 36:05.900
The markings...

36:05.935 --> 36:08.937
did the archdeacon say
what they looked like?

36:08.971 --> 36:12.307
Were they letters

36:12.341 --> 36:14.142
and odd symbols?

36:14.176 --> 36:16.110
You have seen such markings.

36:16.145 --> 36:17.645
No.

36:17.679 --> 36:19.747
Who gives penance
when the priest tells a lie?

36:19.781 --> 36:20.982
(quiet laugh)

36:21.016 --> 36:23.617
The healer.

36:23.652 --> 36:26.086
Yes.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.387
Do you know her?

36:27.422 --> 36:28.755
I do.

36:28.789 --> 36:31.391
She is no heretic.

36:31.426 --> 36:34.461
She is quite the opposite.

36:34.495 --> 36:36.129
Why are they
looking for her?

36:36.164 --> 36:37.831
I do not know.

36:43.404 --> 36:46.106
This archdeacon and his men?

36:46.140 --> 36:48.908
They may be ordained
in Christ's name,

36:48.943 --> 36:51.445
but they serve another.

36:51.479 --> 36:54.747
You must warn Annora,
good priest.

36:57.385 --> 37:00.753
Our healer is
in the Far Caverns.

37:00.788 --> 37:03.923
In a cave at the base
of the widest gorge.

37:10.330 --> 37:12.331
(door opens)

37:13.367 --> 37:15.368
(door closes)

37:28.148 --> 37:32.184
You were greatly missed
at morning meal, my lady.

37:32.219 --> 37:35.921
Baron Pryce and myself so looked
forward to your company.

37:35.955 --> 37:38.557
I find it difficult
to digest anything

37:38.591 --> 37:41.193
with the awareness
that sundown brings

37:41.228 --> 37:44.163
such gruesome justice.

37:44.197 --> 37:47.233
A justice well-deserved.

37:47.267 --> 37:50.202
I had our scribe
search for any records

37:50.237 --> 37:53.371
on our prisoner Berwyn Cairn.

37:53.406 --> 37:56.841
He found no
previous documents.

37:56.875 --> 38:00.345
Only two recent ones,
copied but yesterday.

38:00.379 --> 38:03.781
If this prisoner's justice
is well-deserved,

38:03.815 --> 38:07.185
then why does Baron Pryce see
fit to buy off his debt?

38:07.219 --> 38:08.819
And why do you offer

38:08.854 --> 38:10.688
standing to his family?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.357
Matters you need
not concern yourself with.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.725
All matters of this shire
concern me, Chamberlain.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.728
Then I suggest
you stop treating Pryce

38:17.763 --> 38:19.364
like the bastard of an ogre.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.898
He is our only hope.

38:20.933 --> 38:23.333
I am not a silent child
to be married off

38:23.368 --> 38:26.103
to noble or bastard.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.072
Nor do you carry a child,
silent or otherwise.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.440
We all know our baron

38:29.474 --> 38:31.809
was barren!

38:39.785 --> 38:42.987
I am deeply sorry, my lady.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.625
As am I, Milus.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.064
I have been the offering
of marriage once already.

38:55.133 --> 38:58.001
I will not do it again.

38:58.035 --> 39:00.370
My only concern
is the welfare of this shire,

39:00.405 --> 39:04.341
dear Love.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.177
Baron Pryce's hand in marriage
is the only way

39:07.212 --> 39:09.279
you will hold
your place here.

39:28.732 --> 39:32.468
Did you have a hand
in Lady Trula's death?

39:33.803 --> 39:36.939
Of course not.

39:36.973 --> 39:39.442
We know it was rebels
by what we found

39:39.476 --> 39:40.676
at the wreckage.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.711
But the man we punish today?

39:45.715 --> 39:49.418
A brave representation, my lady.

39:49.453 --> 39:52.321
An act of justice
greater than the man.

39:54.724 --> 39:58.894
A mind that is open
and a heart that is shut tight.

40:03.867 --> 40:06.234
Grandfather's requisite
for leadership.

40:07.737 --> 40:10.405
A very wise man.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.676
A very sad man.

40:46.681 --> 40:49.982
You think he spins a tale
to save himself from servitude?

40:50.017 --> 40:52.018
A converted Jew.

40:52.052 --> 40:55.021
Who knows what darkness
still clouds his soul?

40:55.055 --> 40:57.189
We will see
what becomes of it on our way

40:57.223 --> 41:00.091
out of this godless, damp hole.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.676
I'm sorry, brother.

41:17.711 --> 41:20.879
I owed you, Calo
and the others

41:20.913 --> 41:22.413
the truth.

41:22.448 --> 41:24.082
When I buried my sword,

41:24.116 --> 41:26.751
I should not have buried
all of my past with it.

41:29.255 --> 41:31.689
Farmer or fighter,

41:31.724 --> 41:34.726
I knew the man then.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.728
I know him now.

41:36.762 --> 41:40.098
You are a good friend, Toran.

41:40.132 --> 41:43.368
I wish my friendship
served you better.

41:46.438 --> 41:48.639
Father, I should be helping.

41:48.674 --> 41:52.209
You don't always need
to help, Luca.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.311
You can do other things.

41:54.346 --> 41:56.347
I don't want
to do other things.

41:56.382 --> 41:59.550
I want to be just as you are.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.123
Come on,
you little pint of piss.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.458
(short laugh)

42:07.493 --> 42:08.826
We need to make
our measurements.

42:08.861 --> 42:12.062
Let him do the arithmetic.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.931
He has to.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.832
Because I can't.

42:42.693 --> 42:45.261
Is this what one wears
to watch a man pulled apart?

42:45.296 --> 42:47.997
Is it not to your liking,
my lady?

42:48.032 --> 42:49.999
(knocking)

42:50.034 --> 42:52.536
Are you expecting anyone,
my lady?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.571
No.

42:59.277 --> 43:02.178
Your insolence swings heavier
than your axe, headsman.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.915
Forgive my boldness, my lady.

43:05.950 --> 43:08.451
But I deliver a truth
that will give comfort.

43:09.686 --> 43:12.588
I need but a moment in private.

43:12.623 --> 43:15.591
And that will happen
when pigs learn to dance.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.130
Allow us a moment, maiden.

43:23.199 --> 43:25.368
Yes, Baroness.

43:25.402 --> 43:27.436
I'll be in the yard
dancing with pigs.

43:32.643 --> 43:36.444
And what is this truth,
Master Gawain?

43:39.816 --> 43:43.618
That is not my name.

43:43.653 --> 43:45.520
Gawain Maddox was
an executioner

43:45.554 --> 43:48.556
killed in service
to your husband.

43:48.591 --> 43:53.162
I am one of the hooded
bandits he pursued.

43:53.196 --> 43:56.165
One of the men
who killed Baron Ventris.

43:58.567 --> 43:59.902
I took

43:59.936 --> 44:00.936
the punisher's identity

44:00.970 --> 44:04.071
to save myself and my friends.

44:04.106 --> 44:07.975
Never was the farce to last
more than a moment.

44:10.378 --> 44:12.914
The wife?

44:12.948 --> 44:16.984
The family was...
tortured by Maddox.

44:18.220 --> 44:21.155
It seems I offered them
something different.

44:23.591 --> 44:27.361
My name is Wilkin Brattle.

44:27.395 --> 44:31.332
I was a knight
in Longshanks' army.

44:32.968 --> 44:36.603
Ventris was my commander.

44:36.638 --> 44:40.975
He sent me and my legion
into an ambush of certain death.

44:43.712 --> 44:47.180
I was spared, by a miracle,

44:47.215 --> 44:48.882
and fled to your land.

44:51.586 --> 44:53.587
Only to be roused
again, in blood.

44:57.692 --> 44:59.693
Why do you tell me all this now?

45:01.730 --> 45:05.733
An innocent man will soon
be brutally executed.

45:08.936 --> 45:10.937
I need to save him.

45:17.746 --> 45:19.380
Please honor the
requests of my friends.

45:19.414 --> 45:21.081
They, too, are innocent.

45:29.056 --> 45:31.724
Master... Sir Brattle.

45:33.427 --> 45:36.396
A confession of this candor...

45:36.430 --> 45:39.399
I do not know how...

45:39.433 --> 45:41.401
Give it to Baron
Pryce's Chancellor.

45:41.435 --> 45:43.836
He will take
proper action.

45:46.207 --> 45:48.841
Allow me but a brief
time after I leave you

45:48.876 --> 45:51.244
for some final
tasks and devotion.

45:58.685 --> 46:00.686

to you, Lady Love.

46:03.356 --> 46:07.993
My time with you...

Lady Trula was

Black oak root
