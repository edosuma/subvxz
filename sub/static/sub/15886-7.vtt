08:04.184 --> 08:05.450
Can I ask you a question,
biggest of men?

08:05.452 --> 08:07.118
I got a question
right quick.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.691
(male announcer)
as don's week in the warehouse

08:12.693 --> 08:14.559
Was wrapping up,
he decided it was time

08:14.561 --> 08:16.294
To come clean
with his employees.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.196
Actually, everybody, uh,

08:18.198 --> 08:19.331
I've got an announcement
to make.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.266
Don't nobody want to hear
your bull[bleep], newbie.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.034
- Okay.
- Don't nobody want to hear it!

08:23.036 --> 08:25.070
I think you will care
about this one,

08:25.072 --> 08:26.538
So gather around.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.640
I'm not actually
a new employee.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.441
You could say that again.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.376
You a waste of space,
as far as I'm concerned.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.777
Can't get nothing done on time.

08:32.779 --> 08:36.214
Like a--like a snail over here.

08:36.216 --> 08:41.753
I am actually president
of the company.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.122
You're on<i> undercover boss.</i>

08:44.124 --> 08:46.358
- What?
- The tv show, yeah.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.158
- What?
- Wow.

08:47.160 --> 08:52.163
In this week since I've been
working here amongst you,

08:52.165 --> 08:58.036
I got to hear each and every one
of your stories, just about,

08:58.038 --> 08:59.471
And, uh, I...

08:59.473 --> 09:00.405
You know I was
just playing, right?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.407
You know I--I was just
trying to lighten the mood

09:02.409 --> 09:04.075
In the workplace
and whatnot, you know.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.577
Thank you, joseph.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.045
Bill.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.248
Buddy, you were telling me
that your car broke down,

09:10.250 --> 09:12.150
And it hasn't been
working right ever since.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.620
Well, I want to get you
a new ford explorer.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.089
Oh, my god.
Thank--thank you so much, mark.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.659
That means so much to me.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.661
My whole family
died in one day.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.862
- Joseph.
- Thank you.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.530
Huge car crash.
Huge, man.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.532
We were having a family picnic,
and then this truck

09:27.534 --> 09:29.901
Just came on through
and just killed everybody.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.869
It chopped
everybody's heads off.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.272
Eleanore, you were worried
that you were not going

09:34.274 --> 09:36.775
To be able to afford college
for your two--two boys,

09:36.777 --> 09:40.579
And I'm starting a college
fund for them both.

09:40.581 --> 09:44.049
Putting $10,000
in each one of them.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.918
This is amazing.
I'm so grateful.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.019
You know, I-I can't
make no family anymore

09:48.021 --> 09:49.788
'cause my dick got chopped up
in the accident--

09:49.790 --> 09:51.623
- Joseph, joseph.
- And now I pee out the side.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.358
Sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.193
I just--
I start to pee.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.027
Right in my mouth.

09:56.029 --> 09:56.928
Oh, joseph,
that's disgusting.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.063
Sometimes poop come out
the other side.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.664
- I don't even know why that--
- joseph.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.299
My dick is in eight pieces.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.133
Joseph.
Okay, you know--

10:02.135 --> 10:03.168
If you could
just give me a raise.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.603
I ain't asking for no kind
of scholarships or nothing.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.737
Okay, you know, joseph,
I'm gonna get--

10:05.739 --> 10:06.771
I'm gonna go--get
to you right now.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.206
Okay, dude, did I mention
I was a prostitute

10:08.208 --> 10:09.808
Since the age of 17?
15--10?

10:09.810 --> 10:10.508
No, joseph.
Joseph.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.143
7--3--been a prostitute
since I was 3.

10:12.145 --> 10:12.777
Joseph, joseph--

10:12.779 --> 10:14.346
I was in--I was a prostitute
in the womb.

10:14.348 --> 10:14.846
Joseph.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.648
A dude put his peepee
in my--in my mama,

10:16.650 --> 10:18.016
And it got inside of me,
and then--

10:18.018 --> 10:19.384
And then they gave me money.

10:19.386 --> 10:19.851
Joseph.

10:19.853 --> 10:20.885
Just please, man.
Just give me a raise.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.589
Joseph, you have been rude to me
since the moment I came here.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.256
Come on, man.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.524
I mean, I was playing
with you, dog.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.593
I knew you was the boss
the whole time, man.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.661
Look at this fake
ass mustache.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.063
Ow--that's my real mustache,
joseph.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.400
That really hurt.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.735
You're fired.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.669
Get out of here.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.137
Can I stay and watch?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.572
Get out of here.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.040
I got a rare--
I got a rare condition

10:42.042 --> 10:43.074
That make me unlikable.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.342
No, you don't, joseph.

10:44.344 --> 10:44.776
Lance?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.144
Lance, you been in the urinal
with me.

10:46.146 --> 10:46.978
You see me in the urinal.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.313
Lance, I am sorry,
but do not engage him.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.814
Tell him--tell him my dick
in three pieces.

10:49.816 --> 10:50.715
Joseph,
leave lance alone.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.183
It's true, so they give me
a little bit of money.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.452
- No, it's not gonna happen.
- Can I have a--

10:54.454 --> 10:55.954
Joseph?

10:55.956 --> 10:56.621
He did--he did--

10:56.623 --> 10:59.357
Joseph, leave norman
out of this.

10:59.359 --> 10:59.991
Who's norman?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.093
- The foreman.
- Norman the foreman?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.796
That's his name.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.398
I know that.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.632
I work intimately with him.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.367
No, you don't, you're fired.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.035
All right.
Go on.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.470
All right, out the door
with you, joseph.

11:12.472 --> 11:15.507
I am sorry about that.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.309
Is he gone?

11:18.311 --> 11:21.780
Okay, uh, betty...

11:21.782 --> 11:25.316
When you told me
that your father passed away,

11:25.318 --> 11:27.786
It hit me because my father
passed away.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.654
But my dick got chopped up,
though!

11:29.656 --> 11:30.388
Joseph!

11:30.390 --> 11:31.189
My dick got chopped up.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.190
That is so
disrespectful, joseph.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.092
What are you doing?
I thought you left, joseph.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.493
Like gristle
off a thanksgiving turkey.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.729
- You're lying, and I don't--
- I got a gristle dick.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.998
Joseph,
that's wildly inappropriate.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.932
Straight meat gristle.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.701
It's hanging out here
right here, right now.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.636
- You can't see it.
- Joseph!

11:44.638 --> 11:46.037
(announcer)
coming up.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.238
We have so many siblings,

11:47.240 --> 11:52.644
And just to know that we
both share a familial bond

11:52.646 --> 11:54.779
And that there's nothing
that can take that away.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.281
But my dick got
chopped up, though.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.682
Joseph!

11:57.684 --> 11:59.617
Where--how did you...?

12:05.725 --> 12:09.227
Now, are you still on
the reality show bandwagon?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.596
It's not a bandwagon.
It's a way of life.

12:11.598 --> 12:12.731
Oh, boy.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.032
<i>Bachelor.</i>

12:14.034 --> 12:14.966
Ro--<i> challenge.</i>

12:14.968 --> 12:16.801
- See, that's what's not real.
- It's not real, I mean--

12:16.803 --> 12:19.070
Nothing's real as soon
as the camera appears.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.073
I mean, you and I, we're out
here on the road by ourselves.

12:22.075 --> 12:22.841
This is real.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.775
This is a different thing.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.009
- We're real.
- We're doing something.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.046
You're here, those--that scrub
brush out there is real.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.581
You can smell the...

12:29.583 --> 12:30.648
The dirt of the road.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.016
- Sandy air.
- This is real.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.786
This is real,
what's happening right now.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.888
Mm-hmm.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.897
I think we're both going
to have--you know,

12:45.899 --> 12:49.601
When key and peele's over,
we both have our solo careers.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.069
Yeah, but we'll
come back in.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.137
We'll come back in
every now and then.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.304
Do a little key and peele--
pepper that little

12:53.306 --> 12:54.973
Key and peele--stoice it
back out, come back in,

12:54.975 --> 12:55.740
A little key and peele.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.276
But I think--well, obviously
we're gonna both have success

12:58.278 --> 12:59.410
In our own...

12:59.412 --> 12:59.878
Right.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.212
Right, you know, we're just
gonna be a regular,

13:01.214 --> 13:03.815
You know, simon and garfunkel.

13:03.817 --> 13:04.449
How's that again?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.551
Oh, yeah, I get--oh,
like simon and garfunkel?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.253
No--nnn, kind of, but I'm--

13:08.255 --> 13:09.854
I'm thinking, like,
our solo careers are like--

13:09.856 --> 13:11.256
(both)
simon, garfunkel.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.023
Right, I got you.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.727
No, I think we're agreeing,
so like, I--I would be simon,

13:15.729 --> 13:16.995
And you would be garfunkel.

13:16.997 --> 13:17.829
Garfunkel.
Simon.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.663
I think we're--we're just--

13:18.665 --> 13:19.864
No, no.
No, no, what I'm saying is...

13:19.866 --> 13:20.999
I mean, we're basically saying
the same thing.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.001
It would be like--like,
you would be art garfunkel,

13:23.003 --> 13:26.771
And I'd be
simon--paul simon, so.

13:26.773 --> 13:27.438
It's like--

13:27.440 --> 13:28.873
Well, that's--maybe
that's a bad example.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.075
Maybe that's a bad--but
you know, like, as far as,

13:31.077 --> 13:32.076
Like, going down in history.

13:32.078 --> 13:32.977
It's--we'd be like--yeah.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.078
Going down in history be like--

13:34.080 --> 13:35.280
I'm lucille ball,
you're desi.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.281
I'm desi--I'm lucille,

13:36.283 --> 13:37.081
But you're desi arnaz.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.017
Okay.
Like, I'm elvis the pelvis.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.386
- Mm hmm.
- You're his brother, enis.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.987
With a curl.
What?

13:42.989 --> 13:45.256
I don't even know
who enis presley is.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.258
You know his nickname was?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.059
Yeah.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.528
I'm thinking scott baio and...

13:50.530 --> 13:54.566
(both)
willie aames.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.569
I guess there's no real
winner there, is there.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.470
Well played.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.712
Here's your coffee.

14:07.714 --> 14:11.616
Hey, man, I just have
to say, I am a huge fan.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.818
Outkast, like,
changed my life.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.686
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, man.

14:14.688 --> 14:20.325
So are you gonna collaborate
with andré 3000 again?

14:20.327 --> 14:21.759
Nah.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.728
How come?

14:23.730 --> 14:26.364
People grow apart.

14:33.305 --> 14:34.372
Greetings.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.575
May I have a half-caff
decaf mint mocha latte,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.510
Foam on the bottom,
served in a flower vase,

14:39.512 --> 14:41.279
And if y'all got
some green food coloring

14:41.281 --> 14:43.214
Back there, throw it in.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.415
André 3000!

14:44.417 --> 14:45.216
In the flesh.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.517
Big boi is right over there.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.987
- [gasping dramatically]
- big boi!

14:48.989 --> 14:51.055
Bitch, I'm trying
to read a book.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.724
Big boi!

14:52.726 --> 14:55.960
What's up, my brother
from another mother, man?

14:55.962 --> 14:58.229
Hey, when I say mother, you know
I'm talking about art, right,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.698
'cause we got cut out of
her womb linked together.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.902
What's up, man?
What's up, andré?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.070
André who?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.805
I ain't gonna say it, man.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.476
It's not 2,999.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.511
It's not 3,001.
- André 3000.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.114
Hey, man, what happened
to you after the show?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.215
Yeah, um.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.018
I just--I must have, like, snuck
out or something like that.

15:20.020 --> 15:24.589
[in english accent]
I thought perchance
you went missing.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.024
Don't do the voices, man.

15:26.026 --> 15:26.958
Do what voice, my dear boy?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.693
Why do you--why do you
got to do the voices, man?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.695
Why you doing the voices?
Why you doing that, man?

15:30.697 --> 15:33.998
One green half-caff half
decaf mint mocha latte,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.667
Foam on the bottom,
in a vase?

15:35.669 --> 15:37.435
I got a new idea
for a album, man.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.271
It's gonna be just the sound
of screeching metal,

15:40.273 --> 15:43.374
And then only one
spoken word per track.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.442
- Cool, cool.
- Yeah.

15:44.444 --> 15:49.614
[high pitched squeals]

15:49.616 --> 15:51.282
That's my new screeching
metal sounds

15:51.284 --> 15:52.250
I was talking about
earlier, man.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.986
One green half-caff half
decaf mint mocha latte,

15:54.988 --> 15:58.623

in a vase or "vahz."

You the only [bleep]

Yeah, okay, so what
is going on with me?

16:04.831 --> 16:05.663
What is happening with me?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.967
Man, what the [bleep]
happened, man?

16:08.969 --> 16:12.203
- What are you talking about?
- We used to be somebody, man.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.471
We used to be a team.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.672
We was on top.

16:14.674 --> 16:19.043
Then you went
and lost your [bleep] mind.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.384
Can we just lose this, man?

16:26.386 --> 16:30.088
Can we just lose the 3000
and just have you talk as andré?

16:30.090 --> 16:34.425
Tell me--tell me straight up,
man, what happened?

16:34.427 --> 16:38.629
You know what be even
better, though, man?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.732
Is if you looked into the
pinwheel with your third eye.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.967
I thought you was gonna say
some stupid [bleep] like that.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.235
And everything
will be revealed.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.870
All right, man.
It's been good, man, thank you.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.605
- Thanks for coming by, man.
- Okay, yeah.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.640
Matter of fact, I got
an appointment right now

16:49.642 --> 16:50.742
