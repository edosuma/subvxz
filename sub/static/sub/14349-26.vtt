00:27.150 --> 00:29.448
Who's there?

00:29.519 --> 00:31.009
It's your relief, Sam.

00:38.328 --> 00:39.260
All quiet?

00:39.329 --> 00:40.956
Didn't see
a thing, Chief.

00:41.031 --> 00:42.464
Nobody ever does.

00:42.532 --> 00:45.194
Whatever the thing is,
it's already killed 50 people.

00:47.437 --> 00:49.735
I never realized
how dark it is down here.

00:49.806 --> 00:51.239
Stay on your toes,
Schmitter.

00:51.308 --> 00:54.243
Keep your phaser in your hand
at all times.

00:54.311 --> 00:55.744
What good will that do?

00:55.812 --> 00:59.339
You saw what happened to Ed Appel
when he shot at it.

00:59.416 --> 01:00.940
How about those
other people?

01:01.017 --> 01:04.349
I'm sorry, Schmitter,
but we've got to have guards.

01:04.421 --> 01:06.150
O.K., Chief.

01:08.525 --> 01:10.720
I'll do what I can.

01:10.794 --> 01:11.920
Keep alert.

01:11.995 --> 01:14.793
If you hear anything
or see anything, call in.

01:14.864 --> 01:16.388
Somebody can arrive
in three minutes.

01:16.466 --> 01:19.526
A lot can happen
in three minutes.

01:19.603 --> 01:23.471
Chief, is it true
the Enterprise is on its way?

01:23.540 --> 01:24.700
It's coming.

01:24.774 --> 01:28.175
You think it could get here
in the next four hours?

01:28.245 --> 01:29.678
You'll be all right.

01:56.039 --> 01:56.971
[Fiery Noise]

02:00.610 --> 02:01.838
No.

02:01.911 --> 02:04.038
Aah!

02:04.114 --> 02:05.240
Come on.

02:05.315 --> 02:07.249
Aah...

02:13.723 --> 02:14.849
Schmitter.

02:16.526 --> 02:19.051
Like the rest of them.

02:19.129 --> 02:20.960
Burned to a crisp.

02:29.472 --> 02:32.202
Space --
the final frontier.

02:33.843 --> 02:37.279
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:37.347 --> 02:38.780
Its five-year mission--

02:38.848 --> 02:42.409
to explore
strange new worlds...

02:42.485 --> 02:45.420
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

02:46.690 --> 02:49.955
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:23.059 --> 03:27.462
Captain 's Log -- star date 3196.1.

03:27.530 --> 03:30.021
A distress call
from the pergium

03:30.100 --> 03:31.533
production station
on Janus 6

03:31.601 --> 03:33.000
has brought
the Enterprise

03:33.069 --> 03:34.934
to that
long-established colony.

03:35.004 --> 03:38.440
Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy,
and I have beamed down

03:38.508 --> 03:40.840
to meet with
Chief Engineer Vanderberg,

03:40.910 --> 03:43.003
administrative head
of Janus 6.

03:50.854 --> 03:52.754
Let's assume
there is a monster.

03:52.822 --> 03:55.222
What has it done?
When did it start?

03:55.291 --> 03:58.658
About three months ago,
we opened up a new level.

03:58.728 --> 04:01.356
Sensors gave us
an unusually rich pergium reading.

04:01.431 --> 04:03.797
Not only pergium,
whatever you want.

04:03.867 --> 04:06.461
Uranium, serium, platinum.

04:06.536 --> 04:08.094
The whole planet's
like that.

04:08.171 --> 04:09.399
It's a treasure house.

04:09.472 --> 04:10.905
We're aware of that.

04:10.974 --> 04:12.942
If mining conditions
weren't so difficult,

04:13.009 --> 04:17.036
Janus 6 could supply the mineral
needs of a thousand planets.

04:17.113 --> 04:18.444
But what happened?

04:18.515 --> 04:21.108
First, the automatic
machinery, piece by piece,

04:21.184 --> 04:22.811
started to almost
disintegrate.

04:22.886 --> 04:25.753
Metal began
dissolving away.

04:25.822 --> 04:27.619
There was no reason
for it,

04:27.690 --> 04:30.750
and our chemists were unable
to analyze the corrosive agent.

04:30.827 --> 04:33.387
I'm sure there
is an answer.

04:33.463 --> 04:35.192
It simply has not
yet been discovered.

04:35.265 --> 04:37.529
Yes, it has.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.125
I don't know what this
butchering monster is,

04:40.203 --> 04:42.637
but I know
what it's doing.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.834
Our maintenance engineer
sent down to the drifts

04:46.910 --> 04:48.775
to repair
the corroded machinery.

04:48.845 --> 04:51.678
We found him...
seared to a crisp.

04:53.550 --> 04:54.778
Volcanic activity?

04:54.851 --> 04:58.116
There is none currently
on this planet, Captain.

04:58.188 --> 05:00.315
He's right. None.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.415
At first, the deaths
were down deep,

05:02.492 --> 05:04.790
but they've been moving
up toward our levels.

05:04.861 --> 05:06.795
The last man
died two days ago

05:06.863 --> 05:08.160
three levels below this.

05:08.231 --> 05:09.493
Same way? Burned?

05:09.566 --> 05:12.262
I'd like
to examine the body.

05:12.335 --> 05:15.133
We kept it for you.
There isn't much left.

05:15.205 --> 05:17.139
Roberts will show you.

05:21.244 --> 05:23.235
It isn't pretty.

05:23.313 --> 05:25.474
You post sentries? Guards?

05:25.548 --> 05:29.245
Of course.
Five of them have died.

05:29.319 --> 05:31.219
Who else has seen this?

05:31.287 --> 05:33.118
I have.

05:33.189 --> 05:36.420
This is Ed Appel,
chief processing engineer.

05:39.229 --> 05:40.196
Describe it.

05:40.263 --> 05:43.664
I can't.
I only got a glimpse of it,

05:43.733 --> 05:46.201
but it's...
big and shaggy.

05:46.269 --> 05:48.100
Ed shot it.

05:48.171 --> 05:51.299
Oh. You mean shot at it.

05:51.374 --> 05:54.343
No. I mean shot it.
With this.

05:54.410 --> 05:55.900
Fascinating.

05:55.979 --> 05:57.276
A good, clean shot.

05:57.347 --> 05:59.679
Didn't even
slow it down.

06:01.451 --> 06:04.318
Well, I've made
my report to you.

06:04.387 --> 06:07.322
Production's stopped, nobody
will go into the lower levels,

06:07.390 --> 06:08.857
and I don't blame them.

06:08.925 --> 06:10.187
The Federation
wants pergium,

06:10.260 --> 06:12.990
then you'll have to do
something about it.

06:13.062 --> 06:14.495
That's why we're here.

06:14.564 --> 06:16.498
You're all pretty
tough, aren't you?

06:16.566 --> 06:18.591
Starship,
phaser banks.

06:18.668 --> 06:21.262
You can't get your starship
down in the tunnels.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.565
No need to.

06:22.639 --> 06:25.233
Mr. Vanderberg, I'll need
a complete subsurface chart

06:25.308 --> 06:27.105
of all the drifts,
galleries, tunnels.

06:27.176 --> 06:28.438
You'll get it.

06:28.511 --> 06:30.445
Mr. Vanderberg,
what is this?

06:30.513 --> 06:31.775
It's a silicon
nodule.

06:31.848 --> 06:33.782
Millions of them
are down there.

06:33.850 --> 06:35.112
No commercial
value.

06:35.184 --> 06:38.119
But a geological oddity,
to say the least.

06:38.187 --> 06:39.119
Pure silicon?

06:39.188 --> 06:40.621
A few trace elements.

06:40.690 --> 06:44.091
Look, we didn't call you here
so you could collect rocks.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.457
Thank you,
Mr. Vanderberg.

06:45.528 --> 06:47.428
We'll need your
complete cooperation.

06:47.497 --> 06:48.794
You'll have it.

06:48.865 --> 06:51.299
Just find that creature,
whatever it is.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.301
I've got a quota
to meet.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.802
Come on, Appel.

06:56.639 --> 06:59.574
Vast number of tunnels
won't make our hunting any easier.

06:59.642 --> 07:01.303
Schmitter didn't
burn to death,

07:01.377 --> 07:03.242
not in the usual
sense, anyway.

07:03.313 --> 07:04.245
Explain that.

07:04.314 --> 07:06.248
Well, there are
only fragments

07:06.316 --> 07:08.079
of bone and teeth left,

07:08.151 --> 07:11.086
but the plant's physician agrees
with me -- a chemical corrosion...

07:11.154 --> 07:14.590
Almost as if he'd been
thrown into a vat

07:14.657 --> 07:16.181
of extremely
corrosive acid.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.490
Strong enough
to eat machinery?

07:19.562 --> 07:21.792
Strong enough to eat
anything you can think of.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.797
Mr. Spock,

07:25.868 --> 07:27.130
show me
the positions

07:27.203 --> 07:30.468
of the deaths and
acts of sabotage.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.802
Here, here,
and here.

07:31.874 --> 07:34.274
If the times of these incidents
are accurate,

07:34.344 --> 07:36.778
the creature would
have to have moved

07:36.846 --> 07:38.108
at an incredible speed.

07:38.181 --> 07:39.614
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Vanderberg,

07:39.682 --> 07:41.616
how recent are
these charts?

07:41.684 --> 07:43.618
They were made
last year.

07:43.686 --> 07:46.120
Before the appearance
of whatever it is?

07:46.189 --> 07:47.121
That's right.

07:47.190 --> 07:48.122
I see.

07:48.191 --> 07:50.125
Mr. Spock...
give us a report

07:50.193 --> 07:51.785
on life beneath
the surface.

07:51.861 --> 07:54.625
Within range of our sensors,
there is no life,

07:54.697 --> 07:56.631
other than
the accountable human residents

07:56.699 --> 07:58.633
of this colony
beneath the surface,

07:58.701 --> 08:01.568
uh, at least, no
life as we know it.

08:01.638 --> 08:03.902
We can't cover
all the tunnels on foot.

08:03.973 --> 08:05.270
Production
must be resumed.

08:05.341 --> 08:07.275
We must have
that pergium!

08:07.343 --> 08:09.675
If we could force another
appearance of this creature...

08:09.746 --> 08:12.909
When that creature
appears, men die.

08:17.487 --> 08:18.749
[Fiery Noise]

08:37.506 --> 08:39.702
Aaaahhhh!

08:55.258 --> 08:56.691
Too many tunnels.

08:56.759 --> 08:58.192
We couldn't possibly --

08:58.261 --> 09:00.627
Mr. Spock, our sensors
can pick up

09:00.697 --> 09:03.359
normal life functions
at a considerable distance.

09:03.433 --> 09:06.231
But what about
abnormal life functions?

09:06.302 --> 09:07.394
[Siren Blares]

09:07.470 --> 09:09.904
Something's happening
in the reactor room!

09:17.647 --> 09:19.581
Back to your stations.

09:19.649 --> 09:21.082
Look at that.

09:26.656 --> 09:28.590
I wouldn't
touch it, Captain.

09:28.658 --> 09:30.592
An extremely
active corrosive.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.924
Traces may linger.

09:32.995 --> 09:34.053
Kirk! Quickly!

09:40.169 --> 09:42.603
The main circulating pump
for the entire reactor--

09:42.672 --> 09:43.866
It's gone.

09:43.940 --> 09:46.272
Same indication as shown
at the door, Captain --

09:46.342 --> 09:47.775
very strong
corrosive.

09:47.844 --> 09:49.778
Is there a replacement
for that?

09:49.846 --> 09:51.279
No. None.
It's outdated,

09:51.347 --> 09:52.939
but it always
worked fine.

09:53.015 --> 09:53.982
Spock, onboard?

09:54.050 --> 09:55.950
Nothing for a device
this antiquated.

09:56.018 --> 09:57.451
Without the pump
mechanism,

09:57.520 --> 09:59.112
the reactor will
go supercritical.

09:59.188 --> 10:01.122
It could poison
half the planet.

10:01.190 --> 10:02.782
We can't
shut it down.

10:02.859 --> 10:05.293
It provides heat and air
and life support

10:05.361 --> 10:06.794
for the whole
colony.

10:06.863 --> 10:10.799
Mr. Spock, we seem
to have been given a choice --

10:10.867 --> 10:12.630
death by asphyxiation...

10:12.702 --> 10:14.932
or death by
radiation poisoning.

10:24.881 --> 10:26.314
A PXK pergium reactor?

10:26.382 --> 10:28.976
No, sir. We don't have
any spare circulating pump

10:29.051 --> 10:30.985
for a thing like that.

10:31.053 --> 10:33.851
I haven't seen
a PXK in 20 years.

10:33.923 --> 10:36.858
Can you rig one up?
It's vital.

10:36.926 --> 10:39.326
I can put together
some odds and ends,

10:39.395 --> 10:41.329
but it won't hold
for long.

10:41.397 --> 10:42.329
How long?

10:42.398 --> 10:43.990
48 hours maybe,
with luck.

10:44.066 --> 10:46.000
48 hours is better
than nothing.

10:46.068 --> 10:49.697
Gather what you need
and beam down here. Top priority.

10:49.772 --> 10:50.704
Aye, Captain.

10:50.773 --> 10:52.832
I'll be right down.
Scott out.

10:54.410 --> 10:56.344
What happens
when it breaks down?

10:56.412 --> 10:58.846
Hopefully we'll find
the missing part by then.

10:58.915 --> 10:59.847
Small chance.

10:59.916 --> 11:01.679
The alternative
is to evacuate

11:01.751 --> 11:03.616
all you people
to the Enterprise.

11:03.686 --> 11:05.620
A dozen planets
depend on you

11:05.688 --> 11:07.121
for pergium
for their reactor.

11:07.190 --> 11:09.124
They're already screaming.
Reactors closing down,

11:09.192 --> 11:10.454
life support
systems --

11:10.526 --> 11:12.960
I'm concerned with my
people right here, Kirk.

11:13.029 --> 11:14.291
They're being murdered.

11:14.363 --> 11:16.923
Find that monster
and kill it.

11:16.999 --> 11:19.263
The missing pump
wasn't taken by accident.

11:19.335 --> 11:21.963
It was the one piece of equipment
absolutely essential

11:22.038 --> 11:23.972
for the operation
of the reactor.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.632
Do you think
the creature

11:25.708 --> 11:28.302
is trying to push the colonists
off the planet?

11:28.377 --> 11:29.844
It would seem so.

11:29.912 --> 11:31.812
But why now?
These production facilities

11:31.881 --> 11:34.076
have been in operation
for over 50 years.

11:35.218 --> 11:37.311
I don't know.

11:37.386 --> 11:39.547
But there is
a possibility.

11:41.557 --> 11:42.489
What's that?

11:46.395 --> 11:48.329
Life as we know it

11:48.397 --> 11:52.026
is universally based on some
combination of carbon compounds.

11:54.070 --> 11:58.370
But what if life exists
based on another element?

11:58.441 --> 12:00.841
For instance...

12:00.910 --> 12:01.842
Silicon?

12:03.679 --> 12:06.239
You're creating
fantasies, Mr. Spock.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.578
Not necessarily. I've heard
of the theoretical possibility

12:10.653 --> 12:12.280
of life based
on silicon,

12:12.355 --> 12:14.846
but life of an entirely
different order.

12:17.326 --> 12:20.227
It's possible that our phasers
might not affect it.

12:20.296 --> 12:23.595
Certainly not phaser I, which is
far less powerful than phaser II.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.632
All right.

12:27.370 --> 12:29.804
How about this --

12:29.872 --> 12:32.807
a creature that lives deep
in the planet below us,

12:32.875 --> 12:34.809
at home in solid rock.

12:34.877 --> 12:37.471
It seems to me that
in order to survive,

12:37.546 --> 12:41.915
it would have to have some form
of natural armor plating.

12:41.984 --> 12:43.349
It could explain much,

12:43.419 --> 12:46.479
especially since the colonists
are armed only with phaser I.

12:46.555 --> 12:47.988
But we have phaser II.

12:48.057 --> 12:50.651
Which I could render
more effective against silicon.

12:50.726 --> 12:54.321
Silicon-based life
is physiologically impossible,

12:54.397 --> 12:57.332
especially in
an oxygen atmosphere.

12:59.201 --> 13:01.999
It may be, Doctor,
that the creature can exist

13:02.071 --> 13:04.938
for brief periods
in such an atmosphere

13:05.007 --> 13:07.271
before returning
to its own environment.

13:07.343 --> 13:09.277
I still think
you're imagining things.

13:09.345 --> 13:11.939
Maybe, but at least
it's something to go on.

13:12.014 --> 13:14.448
Mr. Spock, have
Lieutenant Commander Giotto

13:14.517 --> 13:15.779
assemble
the security troops

13:15.851 --> 13:17.785
and arm them
with phaser II.

13:17.853 --> 13:19.787
You make the proper
adjustments.

13:31.367 --> 13:35.030
You seem fascinated
by this rock.

13:37.873 --> 13:38.931
Yes, Captain.

13:40.376 --> 13:42.970
You recall that
Vanderberg commented

13:43.045 --> 13:46.481
there were thousands of these
at a lower level--

13:46.549 --> 13:48.983
the level which
the machinery opened

13:49.051 --> 13:51.815
Just prior to the first appearance
of the creature.

13:51.887 --> 13:53.411
Do they tie in?

13:55.391 --> 13:56.824
I don't know.

13:56.892 --> 13:57.824
Speculate.

14:02.231 --> 14:05.098
I have already given Dr. McCoy
sufficient cause for amusement.

14:05.167 --> 14:08.330
I'd prefer to cogitate
the possibilities for a time.

14:08.404 --> 14:10.338
A short time,
Mr. Spock.

14:11.841 --> 14:13.365
We have very little.

14:16.846 --> 14:18.279
How's it going,
Scotty?

14:18.347 --> 14:19.609
It's a plumber's
nightmare,

14:19.682 --> 14:21.616
but it'll hold
for a bit.

14:21.684 --> 14:23.117
It has to hold
longer.

14:23.185 --> 14:25.619
Sorry. That's about
the best I can do.

14:25.688 --> 14:26.620
[Beep Beep]

14:26.689 --> 14:27.951
Kirk here.

14:28.024 --> 14:29.286
Captain, security officers
have gathered

14:29.358 --> 14:30.791
in Chief Vanderberg's office.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.293
I'll be right there.

14:32.361 --> 14:34.295
Scotty,
ride herd on it.

14:34.363 --> 14:36.297
Kind words.
Tender, loving care.

14:36.365 --> 14:39.300
Kiss it. Baby it.
Flatter it if you have to,

14:39.368 --> 14:40.630
but keep it going.

14:40.703 --> 14:42.637
I'll do what
I can, sir.

14:42.705 --> 14:44.639
You'll proceed
from level to level,

14:44.707 --> 14:46.641
checking out
every foot of opening.

14:46.709 --> 14:49.644
You are searching for
some sort of creature

14:49.712 --> 14:52.146
which is highly resistant
to phaser fire.

14:52.214 --> 14:54.808
Phasers will be set on maximum,
and remember this--

14:54.884 --> 14:57.751
50 people have died.
I want no more deaths.

14:57.820 --> 14:59.082
Except
the bloody thing.

14:59.155 --> 15:01.817
The creature may or may not
attack on sight.

15:01.891 --> 15:02.823
However, you must.

15:02.892 --> 15:04.257
It is vitally important

15:04.326 --> 15:07.989
we get this installation
back into production.

15:08.064 --> 15:10.498
Mr. Vanderberg,
may I ask at which level

15:10.566 --> 15:13.000
you discovered
the nodules of silicon?

15:13.069 --> 15:15.401
The 23rd. Why?

15:15.471 --> 15:17.405
Commander Giotto,
take your detail.

15:17.473 --> 15:19.407
Go directly
to the 23rd level.

15:19.475 --> 15:20.908
Start your search
there.

15:20.976 --> 15:23.774
Aye, aye, sir.
Do you have reason to suspect

15:23.846 --> 15:26.280
this creature may
be on that level?

15:26.348 --> 15:27.940
It's a possibility
we've discussed.

15:28.017 --> 15:31.282
Keep your people on the top level
together at a safe place.

15:31.353 --> 15:33.651
I don't know any safe place,
Captain,

15:33.722 --> 15:35.986
the way that thing
comes and goes.

15:36.058 --> 15:38.492
Well, gentlemen,
you have your instructions.

15:38.561 --> 15:39.994
Let's get at it.

16:14.663 --> 16:16.597
[Sensor Wails]

16:23.672 --> 16:25.264
Mr. Spock?

16:25.341 --> 16:26.433
Find something?

16:26.509 --> 16:29.444
Adjusting my tricorder
to register for silicon.

16:29.512 --> 16:31.275
[Sensor Continues
To Wail]

16:34.416 --> 16:35.348
Interesting.

16:35.417 --> 16:36.349
Traces?

16:46.862 --> 16:49.296
A life form, Captain...

16:49.365 --> 16:51.458
bearing -- 111 degrees.

16:51.534 --> 16:52.967
Elevation -- 4 degrees.

16:53.035 --> 16:54.468
One of our people?

16:54.537 --> 16:56.232
No, sir. Silicon.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.307
Come on.

17:17.826 --> 17:19.020
[Fiery Noise]

17:21.997 --> 17:24.932
Aaaaahhhh!

17:36.178 --> 17:38.772
He never even had
a chance to fire, Captain.

17:38.847 --> 17:41.441
It's only been seconds
since we heard him scream.

17:41.517 --> 17:43.451
The creature must
still be around.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.140
Captain.

18:10.913 --> 18:12.107
This tunnel.

18:12.181 --> 18:15.082
My readings indicate
it was made within the hour,

18:15.150 --> 18:16.412
moments ago,
in fact.

18:16.485 --> 18:18.350
- Are you certain?
- Positive.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.445
This tunnel goes
out of sight.

18:20.522 --> 18:23.423
Our best machinery couldn't
cut a tunnel like this.

18:23.492 --> 18:25.892
Indeed, Captain.
I'm quite at a loss.

18:25.961 --> 18:26.893
[Fiery Noise]

18:44.847 --> 18:45.779
Get gone.

18:46.849 --> 18:47.941
Disappeared.

18:48.017 --> 18:49.951
Astonishing that
anything of that bulk

18:50.019 --> 18:51.611
could move
so rapidly.

18:51.687 --> 18:53.120
These walls are hot.

18:53.188 --> 18:54.553
Indeed.

18:54.623 --> 18:55.954
This tunnel
was cut

18:56.025 --> 18:57.617
within the last
two minutes.

18:57.693 --> 18:58.955
You all right,
Captain?

18:59.028 --> 18:59.960
Yes. Perfectly.

19:00.029 --> 19:01.291
Did you see it?

19:01.363 --> 19:03.297
Yes. Where does
the tunnel go?

19:03.365 --> 19:05.890
Readings indicate a maze of tunnels
in that direction.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.560
Did you shoot
at it?

19:07.636 --> 19:10.400
Yes. We took
a bite out of it.

19:15.744 --> 19:17.678
Not animal tissue.

19:17.746 --> 19:19.179
What is it?

19:19.248 --> 19:21.682
Closest approximation
I could come to

19:21.750 --> 19:23.183
would be
fibrous asbestos,

19:23.252 --> 19:24.685
a mineral, Captain.

19:24.753 --> 19:26.414
Then your guess
was right.

19:26.488 --> 19:27.750
It would seem so.

19:27.823 --> 19:29.415
Silicon-based.

19:29.491 --> 19:30.458
Summation.

19:30.526 --> 19:32.926
We are dealing with
a silicon creature

19:32.995 --> 19:34.428
of the deep rocks,

19:34.496 --> 19:36.430
capable of moving
through solid rock

19:36.498 --> 19:38.932
as easily as we move
through the air.

19:39.001 --> 19:40.434
That explains
the tunnels.

19:40.502 --> 19:43.767
This creature's body secretes
an extremely powerful corrosive.

19:43.839 --> 19:46.706
Powerful enough to dissolve
the door of the reactor chamber.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.936
And it explains
the murdered men.

19:50.512 --> 19:52.104
It's definitely
phaser resistant.

19:52.181 --> 19:55.446
We had our weapons set
for silicon and on full power,

19:55.517 --> 19:58.213
yet we only damaged it.
It still lives.

19:58.287 --> 19:59.982
Meaning it's
impossible to kill?

20:00.055 --> 20:02.455
No. No, it might require
amassed phasers.

20:02.524 --> 20:05.459
Or a single phaser
with much longer contact.

20:05.527 --> 20:06.653
Commander...

20:08.530 --> 20:10.464
Pass this on
to your men --

20:10.532 --> 20:12.557
We knew
it was a killer.

20:12.634 --> 20:14.067
Now it's wounded...

20:14.136 --> 20:15.569
probably in pain

20:15.637 --> 20:17.195
somewhere
back there.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.473
There's nothing more dangerous
than a wounded animal.

20:27.149 --> 20:28.639
Commander Giotto.

20:28.717 --> 20:31.185
Instruct your men to concentrate
the search in this sector.

20:31.253 --> 20:33.187
Remind them
the creature is wounded.

20:33.255 --> 20:34.688
Aye, aye, sir.

20:38.026 --> 20:39.459
What is it, Spock?

20:39.528 --> 20:42.964
I've run a complete check
on all life forms, radius 100 miles.

20:43.031 --> 20:44.623
I've located all our men,

20:44.700 --> 20:46.292
and I've located
one creature

20:46.368 --> 20:49.303
moving rapidly through
native rock, bearing 201.

20:49.371 --> 20:50.804
And that is all.

20:50.873 --> 20:52.807
One creature
in 100 miles?

20:52.875 --> 20:54.172
Exactly.

20:54.243 --> 20:56.643
Captain, there are literally
thousands of these tunnels

20:56.712 --> 20:58.304
in this general
area alone,

20:58.380 --> 21:01.315
far too many to be cut
by the one creature

21:01.383 --> 21:02.645
in an ordinary
lifetime.

21:02.718 --> 21:04.413
Then we're dealing with
more than one creature,

21:04.486 --> 21:05.919
despite your
tricorder readings,

21:05.988 --> 21:07.922
or we have
a creature

21:07.990 --> 21:09.924
with an extremely
long life span.

21:09.992 --> 21:13.257
Or it's the last
of a race of creatures

21:13.328 --> 21:14.556
which made these tunnels.

21:14.630 --> 21:18.088
If it is the only survivor
of a dead race,

21:18.167 --> 21:22.570
to kill it would be
a crime against science.

21:25.674 --> 21:27.073
Mr. Spock...

21:27.142 --> 21:30.077
our mission is
to protect this colony,

21:30.145 --> 21:31.908
to get the pergium
moving again.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.414
This is not a
zoological expedition.

21:36.518 --> 21:38.952
Maintain a constant
reading on the creature.

21:39.021 --> 21:42.457
If we have to, we'll use phasers
to cut our own tunnels.

21:42.524 --> 21:43.957
We'll try
to surround it.

21:47.529 --> 21:48.962
I'm sorry, Mr. Spock,

21:49.031 --> 21:51.966
but I'm afraid
the creature must die.

21:53.535 --> 21:55.969
I see no alternative
myself, Captain.

21:56.038 --> 21:57.699
It merely seems a pity.

21:57.773 --> 22:00.708
The search team
is gathering in the main tunnel.

22:00.776 --> 22:01.708
Good.

22:01.777 --> 22:04.405
So it is wounded...

22:04.480 --> 22:06.914
and therefore
twice as dangerous.

22:06.982 --> 22:08.415
Stay in pairs.

22:08.484 --> 22:09.917
If you see it,

22:09.985 --> 22:11.418
concentrate
your phaser fire

22:11.487 --> 22:13.921
at what appears
to be its head.

22:13.989 --> 22:14.921
Concentrate it.

22:14.990 --> 22:16.116
Maintain it.

22:16.191 --> 22:18.921
It is definitely resistant,
but it can be hurt,

22:18.994 --> 22:21.428
and thus
it can be killed.

22:21.497 --> 22:23.431
Gentlemen, if you'll examine
your charts.

22:23.499 --> 22:25.091
I last located
the creature

22:25.167 --> 22:27.101
in the area
marked Attit-26

22:27.169 --> 22:29.797
moving in bearing 201.

22:29.872 --> 22:32.602
This particular group
will move out beyond that area

22:32.674 --> 22:34.767
in all directions
to surround it,

22:34.843 --> 22:36.037
possibly capture it.

22:37.179 --> 22:39.545
Your orders are
shoot to kill.

22:39.615 --> 22:42.948
Protect yourself
at all times.

22:43.018 --> 22:44.952
Commander Giotto,
disperse your search parties.

22:45.020 --> 22:46.453
Aye, aye, sir.

22:46.522 --> 22:48.956
Louis, Vinzi,
take your men out.

22:49.024 --> 22:50.184
Mr. Spock.

22:53.028 --> 22:55.622
Capture it? I don't recall
giving any such order.

22:55.697 --> 22:58.632
You did not. I thought,
if the opportunity arose--

22:58.700 --> 23:00.930
I will lose
no more men.

23:01.003 --> 23:03.471
The creature will
be killed on sight.

23:03.539 --> 23:04.904
That's the end of it.

23:04.973 --> 23:06.338
Very well, sir.

23:06.408 --> 23:07.340
Mr. Spock.

23:07.409 --> 23:09.400
I want you
to assist Scotty

23:09.478 --> 23:13.312
in maintaining
that make shift circulating pump.

23:15.150 --> 23:17.118
I--I beg your pardon, sir?

23:17.185 --> 23:21.087
You heard me. It's vital that
we keep that reactor in operation.

23:21.156 --> 23:22.418
Your scientific
knowledge --

23:22.491 --> 23:24.083
Is not needed there, sir.

23:24.159 --> 23:26.423
Mr. Scott has
far more knowledge

23:26.495 --> 23:28.258
of nuclear reactors
than I.

23:28.330 --> 23:29.797
You're aware of that.

23:29.865 --> 23:32.425
Mr. Spock, you
are second in command.

23:32.501 --> 23:34.401
This hunt
will be dangerous.

23:34.469 --> 23:37.370
Either one of us alone
is expendable. Both are not.

23:37.439 --> 23:39.930
Captain, there are
approximately 100 of us

23:40.008 --> 23:42.943
engaged in this search
against one creature.

23:43.011 --> 23:50.076
The odds against you and I
both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1.

23:51.853 --> 23:55.789
2,228.7 to 1?

23:58.527 --> 24:00.461
Those are pretty good odds,
Mr. Spock.

24:00.529 --> 24:02.963
And they are
of course accurate, Captain.

24:03.031 --> 24:03.963
Of course.

24:04.967 --> 24:07.401
Well, I hate
to use the word,

24:07.469 --> 24:10.404
but logically,
with those kind of odds,

24:10.472 --> 24:13.407
you might as well
stay.

24:13.475 --> 24:16.911
But please stay out of trouble,
Mr. Spock.

24:16.979 --> 24:19.072
That is always
my intention, Captain.

24:20.816 --> 24:21.748
[Beep Beep]

24:23.485 --> 24:24.417
Kirk here.

24:24.486 --> 24:25.919
Scotty here, Captain.

24:25.988 --> 24:28.422
My brilliant improvisation
Just gave up the ghost.

24:28.490 --> 24:29.923
He couldn't
stand the strain.

24:29.992 --> 24:31.584
Can you
fix it again?

24:31.660 --> 24:33.753
Negative, Captain.
It's gone for good.

24:33.829 --> 24:36.798
Start evacuation of all colonists
to the Enterprise.

24:36.865 --> 24:38.230
Not all, Captain.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.860
I and my key personnel
are staying.

24:40.936 --> 24:42.733
We'll be down
to join you.

24:42.804 --> 24:44.465
We haven't enough
phasers for you.

24:44.539 --> 24:45.972
We'll use clubs.

24:46.041 --> 24:48.475
We won't run away.
We're staying.

24:48.543 --> 24:51.478
Good. Get everybody else
aboard the Enterprise.

24:51.546 --> 24:52.979
The fewer people
down here,

24:53.048 --> 24:54.982
the longer
we can hold out.

24:55.050 --> 24:56.278
How much longer, Scotty?

24:56.351 --> 24:58.251
The reactor goes critical
in 10 hours

24:58.320 --> 25:00.481
unless you find
the mechanism.

25:00.555 --> 25:01.988
We'll do our best.

25:02.057 --> 25:04.491
Start feeding us
constant status reports.

25:04.559 --> 25:07.187
Vanderberg, you
and your crew assemble

25:07.262 --> 25:10.698
at level 23, checkpoint Tiger.
Kirk out.

25:12.267 --> 25:13.700
Team up with
Enterprise personnel.

25:13.769 --> 25:15.202
They're better armed
than you.

25:15.270 --> 25:17.204
Always keep
someone in sight.

25:17.272 --> 25:19.706
Vanderberg, take two men
and enter that tunnel.

25:19.775 --> 25:21.208
Rendezvous
with Commander Giotto.

25:21.276 --> 25:23.710
Appel and the rest,
go through there.

25:23.779 --> 25:26.213
Tie up with
Lieutenant Osborne's detail.

25:26.281 --> 25:30.718
Mr. Spock and I will control
the operation from a central point.

25:30.786 --> 25:31.718
That's all.

25:36.291 --> 25:37.724
Mr. Spock?

25:38.794 --> 25:40.728
Captain, we are
being watched.

25:41.797 --> 25:43.230
Are you sure?

25:43.298 --> 25:44.731
Intuition?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.233
No, sir.

25:46.301 --> 25:48.633
We're being watched.

25:58.146 --> 26:00.239
[Electronic Tone]

26:00.315 --> 26:01.247
Captain.

26:01.316 --> 26:03.250
Fresh readings
within the hour

26:03.318 --> 26:05.183
in each of these tunnels.

26:05.253 --> 26:08.188
Chart says both of these
tunnels converge

26:08.256 --> 26:10.190
a few thousand
yards further.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.694
You go left.
I'll go right.

26:13.762 --> 26:15.195
Should we separate?

26:16.765 --> 26:19.199
Two tunnels,
two of us.

26:19.267 --> 26:20.700
We separate.

27:19.761 --> 27:20.853
Mr. Spock.

27:20.929 --> 27:22.863
Yes, Captain.

27:22.931 --> 27:27.698
I've found a whole layer
of these silicon nodules of yours,

27:27.769 --> 27:29.202
hundreds of them.

27:29.271 --> 27:30.363
[Spock]
Indeed?

27:30.438 --> 27:32.929
I find that most
illuminating, Captain.

27:33.008 --> 27:35.602
Be absolutely certain
you do not damage any of them.

27:36.778 --> 27:38.609
Explain.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.375
Only a theory I have.

27:40.448 --> 27:42.040
[Rumbling]

27:43.218 --> 27:44.845
Captain?

27:48.290 --> 27:49.723
[Spock]
Are you all right?

27:50.792 --> 27:51.724
Jim?

27:52.794 --> 27:53.726
Jim!

27:55.797 --> 27:57.128
Yes, Mr. Spock.
All right.

27:57.199 --> 28:01.226
We...seem to have
had a cave-in.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.174
I could phaser you out.

28:07.242 --> 28:08.675
[Kirk]
No, you better not.

28:08.743 --> 28:11.541
Any disturbance might
bring down the rest.

28:11.613 --> 28:13.672
Besides, it isn't necessary.

28:13.748 --> 28:17.411
The chart said the tunnels
meet further on.

28:17.485 --> 28:18.679
Very well,

28:18.753 --> 28:21.187
but I find it
extremely disquieting

28:21.256 --> 28:24.692
that your roof chose
that particular moment to collapse.

28:24.759 --> 28:26.693
Please proceed
with extreme caution.

28:26.761 --> 28:29.161
I shall quicken my pace.

28:29.231 --> 28:30.664
Very well, Mr. Spock.

28:30.732 --> 28:32.893
I'll meet you
at the other end--

28:32.968 --> 28:35.334
[Rumbling]

29:45.173 --> 29:47.107
[Beep Beep]

29:47.175 --> 29:48.437
Kirk here.

29:48.510 --> 29:51.968
Captain, I just read
some fresh signs.

29:52.047 --> 29:53.742
The creature is
in this area.

29:53.815 --> 29:55.248
I'll take
a life form reading.

29:55.317 --> 29:56.750
It's not necessary,
Mr. Spock.

29:56.818 --> 29:59.116
I know exactly where
the creature is.

29:59.187 --> 30:00.745
Where, Captain?

30:00.822 --> 30:03.791
10 feet away from me.

30:03.858 --> 30:05.257
Kill it, Captain,
quickly.

30:05.327 --> 30:09.991
It's not making any
threatening moves, Spock.

30:10.065 --> 30:11.760
You don't dare
take the chance.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.266
Kill it.

30:13.335 --> 30:15.769
I thought you wanted it
kept alive,

30:15.837 --> 30:16.929
captured if possible.

30:17.005 --> 30:18.768
Jim, your life
is in danger.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.774
You can't take
the risk.

30:20.842 --> 30:24.039
It seems to be waiting.

30:24.112 --> 30:26.945
I remind you
it's a proven killer.

30:27.015 --> 30:29.540
I'm on my way.
Spock out.

30:58.546 --> 30:59.808
Well...

30:59.881 --> 31:02.816
what do we do,
Just...talk it over?

31:08.323 --> 31:11.258
Well, you can be hurt,
can't you?

31:13.695 --> 31:15.458
We just sit here?

31:17.832 --> 31:19.197
It's your move.

31:22.137 --> 31:23.661
No, no! Don't shoot.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.295
Come on over,
Mr. Spock.

32:06.815 --> 32:08.146
Fascinating.

32:09.317 --> 32:11.751
He's made no moves
against you.

32:11.820 --> 32:14.983
No. It seems
to be waiting.

32:15.056 --> 32:17.524
I tried talking to it,
but no response.

32:21.296 --> 32:22.763
Yes...

32:24.099 --> 32:25.532
They're all through here.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.500
All over the place.

32:28.570 --> 32:29.764
Thousands of them.

32:29.838 --> 32:31.396
Yes, I see.

32:33.608 --> 32:35.041
It means something to you?

32:36.611 --> 32:38.545
Possibly the answer,
Captain,

32:38.613 --> 32:41.047
but I'm not certain.

32:43.118 --> 32:46.053
Captain, you are aware
of the Vulcan technique

32:46.121 --> 32:48.055
of the joining
of two minds.

32:52.627 --> 32:55.562
You think you can get
through to that thing?

32:55.630 --> 32:57.063
Possible.

32:59.134 --> 33:00.260
Mr. Spock...

33:01.436 --> 33:03.563
I know it's a...

33:03.638 --> 33:06.573
terrible personal lowering
of mental barriers...

33:06.641 --> 33:08.768
but if there's a chance...

33:08.843 --> 33:10.538
I'll try.

33:48.449 --> 33:49.711
Aah!

33:54.622 --> 33:55.919
Pain!

33:57.625 --> 33:59.115
Pain!

33:59.194 --> 34:01.389
Pain!

34:06.801 --> 34:08.996
That's all I got,
Captain...

34:09.070 --> 34:11.163
waves and waves
of searing pain.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.433
It's in agony.

34:42.103 --> 34:44.003
''No kill I.''

34:45.239 --> 34:48.641
What is that,
a plea for us not to kill it,

34:48.710 --> 34:51.007
or a promise that
it won't kill us?

34:51.079 --> 34:53.047
I don't know,
Captain.

34:53.114 --> 34:55.047
Evidently, it gained
an immediate knowledge of us

34:55.116 --> 34:57.550
from its empathy
with me.

34:57.619 --> 34:59.712
In my brief contact
with the creature's mind,

34:59.787 --> 35:01.721
I discovered it is
a highly intelligent,

35:01.789 --> 35:02.983
extremely sophisticated animal...

35:03.057 --> 35:05.719
in great pain, of course,
because of its wound,

35:05.793 --> 35:08.762
but not reacting at all
like a wounded creature.

35:08.830 --> 35:10.764
It calls itself
a Horta.

35:12.900 --> 35:14.333
A Horta.

35:16.404 --> 35:18.497
A Horta!

35:18.573 --> 35:21.167
Mr. Spock, we need that
retardation mechanism.

35:21.242 --> 35:23.176
You must reestablish
communications with it.

35:23.244 --> 35:26.179
Captain, it has no reason
to give us the device,

35:26.247 --> 35:27.509
and apparently
every reason

35:27.582 --> 35:29.516
for wishing us
off this planet.

35:29.584 --> 35:30.778
I'm aware of that.

35:30.852 --> 35:33.514
If we could only
win its...

35:33.588 --> 35:35.112
confidence.

35:39.927 --> 35:41.792
Dr. McCoy,
this is Captain Kirk.

35:41.863 --> 35:43.125
[McCoy]
Yes, Captain?

35:43.197 --> 35:47.031
Grab your medical kit
and come down here on the double.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.261
Is somebody
injured?

35:48.336 --> 35:49.394
What happened?

35:49.470 --> 35:51.836
Never mind. Just come down
to the 23rd level.

35:51.906 --> 35:54.272
You'll be led to us
by tricorder readings.

35:54.342 --> 35:55.536
Jim, I remind you

35:55.610 --> 35:58.044
that this is
a silicon-based form of life.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.046
Dr. McCoy's medical knowledge
will be useless.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.207
He's a healer,
let him heal.

36:02.283 --> 36:05.548
Mr. Spock, you must
reestablish communications.

36:05.620 --> 36:09.317
I want to know why it
suddenly took to murder.

36:09.390 --> 36:12.325
To obtain that kind
of communication, Captain,

36:12.393 --> 36:14.827
it will be necessary
to touch it.

36:18.900 --> 36:21.164
We have seen how
the creature destroys.

37:03.111 --> 37:04.544
Lieutenant Commander Giotto.

37:04.612 --> 37:05.806
Giotto here,
Captain.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.972
Are you
all right?

37:07.048 --> 37:08.982
Perfectly all right.
Where are you?

37:09.050 --> 37:10.984
We're at the end
of the tunnel.

37:11.052 --> 37:12.986
A Mr. Vanderberg and
his men are here,

37:13.054 --> 37:14.214
and they're
pretty ugly.

37:14.288 --> 37:15.482
Shall I let them
through?

37:15.556 --> 37:18.491
Under no circumstances
allow them in here yet.

37:18.559 --> 37:20.493
The minute
Doc McCoy gets there,

37:20.561 --> 37:21.892
send him through.

37:21.963 --> 37:22.987
Aye, aye, sir.

37:28.403 --> 37:29.836
Pity!

37:32.907 --> 37:35.000
The thousands...

37:36.477 --> 37:37.842
Devils!

37:40.248 --> 37:42.910
Eternity ends...

37:46.087 --> 37:49.682
The chamber of the ages...

37:49.757 --> 37:52.351
The altar of tomorrow!

37:56.931 --> 37:58.228
[Spock]
Murderers!

38:00.935 --> 38:02.197
Stop them!

38:03.604 --> 38:05.697
Kill!

38:05.773 --> 38:07.468
Strike back!

38:09.544 --> 38:11.444
Monsters!

38:17.552 --> 38:19.577
What in the name of...

38:30.731 --> 38:32.164
What is Spock doing?

38:32.233 --> 38:34.667
It's wounded--badly.
You've got to help it.

38:34.735 --> 38:36.168
Help that?

38:36.237 --> 38:37.670
Go take a look.

38:46.581 --> 38:48.674
[Spock]
The end of life...

38:51.419 --> 38:53.011
Murderers.

39:10.371 --> 39:12.305
You can't be serious.

39:12.373 --> 39:14.841
That thing is virtually
made out of stone!

39:14.909 --> 39:16.968
Help it. Treat it.

39:17.044 --> 39:19.137
I'm a doctor,
not a bricklayer.

39:19.213 --> 39:21.147
You're a healer.
There's a patient.

39:21.215 --> 39:22.648
That's an order.

39:32.059 --> 39:33.321
Mr. Spock...

39:35.863 --> 39:38.297
Tell it we're
trying to help.

39:42.737 --> 39:43.999
The mechanism.

39:46.073 --> 39:47.665
Understood.

39:52.413 --> 39:54.677
Is the end of life...

39:57.084 --> 40:00.019
Eternity stops...

40:03.925 --> 40:05.290
Go out...

40:05.359 --> 40:08.021
into the tunnel.

40:12.266 --> 40:16.134
To the chamber...
of the ages.

40:23.110 --> 40:25.874
Cry...

40:25.947 --> 40:27.710
for the children.

40:30.952 --> 40:34.217
Walk...carefully...

40:36.123 --> 40:38.887
in the vault
of tomorrow.

40:42.129 --> 40:44.723
[Sobbing]

40:44.799 --> 40:51.068
Sorrow...for
the murdered children.

41:06.821 --> 41:08.948
The thing you
search for is there.

41:10.925 --> 41:12.859
Go.

41:12.927 --> 41:14.690
Go.

41:18.366 --> 41:19.856
Sadness.

41:22.103 --> 41:24.970
Sadness...

41:25.039 --> 41:27.473
for the end of things.

41:30.711 --> 41:32.474
Go...

41:32.546 --> 41:33.808
into the tunnel.

41:35.883 --> 41:39.375
There is a passage way.

41:39.453 --> 41:40.886
Quickly, quickly.

41:49.363 --> 41:51.729
The captain said for you
to wait here,

41:51.799 --> 41:53.630
and here is where
you'll wait.

41:53.701 --> 41:55.293
That murdering
monster's in there.

41:55.369 --> 41:56.802
We're going to kill it.

41:56.871 --> 41:58.133
You're going
to stay here.

42:42.550 --> 42:43.983
That's right,
Lieutenant.

42:44.051 --> 42:46.485
Just beam it down
to me immediately,

42:46.554 --> 42:48.988
and never mind
what I want it for.

42:49.056 --> 42:50.489
I just want it!

42:50.558 --> 42:51.490
Now move!

42:53.060 --> 42:55.893
It is time...

42:55.963 --> 42:57.260
to sleep.

42:59.767 --> 43:01.200
It is over.

43:03.104 --> 43:04.264
Failure.

43:07.241 --> 43:09.903
The murderers...

43:09.977 --> 43:13.037
have won.

43:13.114 --> 43:15.514
Death is welcome.

43:18.185 --> 43:20.881
Let it end...

43:20.955 --> 43:21.887
here.

43:21.956 --> 43:22.888
Mr. Spock...

43:25.860 --> 43:26.792
Mr. Spock...

43:26.861 --> 43:29.329
Spock...

43:29.396 --> 43:30.522
Spock...

43:30.598 --> 43:32.031
Come out of it.

43:44.879 --> 43:47.313
I found the unit
in there.

43:47.381 --> 43:49.315
It's in pretty good shape.

43:49.383 --> 43:52.318
I also found about
a million of these...

43:52.386 --> 43:54.320
silicon nodules.

43:54.388 --> 43:55.821
They're eggs,
aren't they?

43:55.890 --> 43:57.323
Yes, Captain, eggs...

43:57.391 --> 43:58.824
and about to hatch.

43:58.893 --> 44:02.761
Miners must have broken
into the hatchery.

44:02.830 --> 44:06.960
Their operations
destroyed thousands.

44:07.034 --> 44:07.932
No wonder.

44:08.002 --> 44:09.867
There. They're coming.

44:12.940 --> 44:16.273
All right!
All right, let's go!

44:16.343 --> 44:17.503
Come on.

44:18.746 --> 44:21.544
How are you doing, Doc?

44:21.615 --> 44:24.015
I'll let you know.

44:24.084 --> 44:26.279
[Running Footsteps]

44:26.353 --> 44:28.287
All right,
let's get them!

44:28.355 --> 44:29.413
Don't fire.

44:29.490 --> 44:31.788
First man that fires
is dead.

44:31.859 --> 44:35.226
That thing has killed
50 of my men.

44:35.296 --> 44:37.560
You've killed thousands
of her children.

44:37.631 --> 44:38.598
What?

44:38.666 --> 44:41.032
Those round silicon
nodules you've been

44:41.101 --> 44:42.534
collecting
and destroying?

44:42.603 --> 44:45.128
They're her eggs.

44:48.142 --> 44:49.575
Tell them, Mr. Spock.

44:49.643 --> 44:52.578
There have been many generations
of Horta on this planet.

44:52.646 --> 44:55.376
Every 50,000 years,
the entire race dies,

44:55.449 --> 44:57.883
all but one,
like this one,

44:57.952 --> 44:59.385
but the eggs live.

44:59.453 --> 45:01.921
She cares for them...

45:01.989 --> 45:03.286
protects them.

45:03.357 --> 45:04.790
And when they hatch,

45:04.859 --> 45:07.726
she is the mother to them,
thousands of them.

45:07.795 --> 45:10.730
This creature here is
the mother of her race.

45:10.798 --> 45:15.929
The Horta is intelligent...
peaceful...

45:16.003 --> 45:17.231
mild.

45:17.304 --> 45:19.898
She had no objection to sharing
this planet with you,

45:19.974 --> 45:22.408
till you broke
into her nursery

45:22.476 --> 45:24.410
and started
destroying her eggs.

45:24.478 --> 45:27.413
Then she fought back
the only way she knew how,

45:27.481 --> 45:31.315
as any mother would
when her children are in danger.

45:31.385 --> 45:32.818
We didn't know.

45:32.887 --> 45:34.115
How could we?

45:34.188 --> 45:36.122
You mean,
if these eggs hatch,

45:36.190 --> 45:37.452
thousands
of those things

45:37.524 --> 45:39.822
will be crawling
around down here?

45:39.894 --> 45:41.828
This is where they live.

45:41.896 --> 45:44.194
They digest rock.
They tunnel for nourishment.

45:44.265 --> 45:46.699
And they are the most inoffensive
of creatures.

45:46.767 --> 45:48.701
They harbor no ill will.

45:48.769 --> 45:51.499
Look, we have
pergium to deliver.

45:51.572 --> 45:53.062
Yes, I know.

45:55.209 --> 45:57.575
Here's your
circulating pump.

45:58.712 --> 46:00.646
You've complained
this planet is

46:00.714 --> 46:02.147
a mineralogical
treasure house

46:02.216 --> 46:05.151
if you had the equipment
to get at it.

46:05.219 --> 46:07.153
The Horta moves
through rock

46:07.221 --> 46:10.622
the way we move through
air, leaving tunnels.

46:10.691 --> 46:12.989
The greatest natural miners
in the universe.

46:13.060 --> 46:16.894
It seems to me we could
make an agreement,

46:16.964 --> 46:18.761
reach a modus vivendi.

46:20.467 --> 46:23.459
They tunnel.
You collect and process,

46:23.537 --> 46:24.970
and your process operation

46:25.039 --> 46:28.167
would be a thousand times
more profitable.

46:33.981 --> 46:36.415
It sounds all right
if it will work.

46:36.483 --> 46:37.916
Except for one thing.

46:37.985 --> 46:40.215
The Horta is
badly wounded.

46:40.287 --> 46:41.720
It may die.

46:41.789 --> 46:43.222
It won't die!

46:43.290 --> 46:46.521
I'm beginning to think
I can cure a rainy day.

46:46.593 --> 46:48.026
Can you help it?

46:48.095 --> 46:50.029
Help it? I cured it.

46:50.097 --> 46:51.029
How?

46:51.098 --> 46:53.532
I had the ship beam down

46:53.600 --> 46:55.534
100 pounds of that
thermal concrete

46:55.602 --> 46:57.593
we use to build
emergency shelters.

46:57.671 --> 46:59.400
It's mostly silicon.

46:59.473 --> 47:01.907
I just troweled it
into the wound.

47:01.976 --> 47:04.410
It'll act like a bandage
until it heals.

47:04.478 --> 47:05.911
Take a look.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.845
It's as good as new.

47:07.915 --> 47:10.850
You'll have to get in touch
with the Horta again.

47:10.918 --> 47:12.351
Tell her our proposition.

47:12.419 --> 47:14.979
She and her children
can tunnel.

47:15.055 --> 47:16.989
Our people will
remove the minerals.

47:17.057 --> 47:19.457
Each side leaves
the other alone.

47:19.526 --> 47:20.788
Think she'll go for it?

47:20.861 --> 47:22.294
It seems logical,
Captain.

47:22.363 --> 47:25.264
The Horta has
a very logical mind.

47:25.332 --> 47:27.766
And after close association
with humans,

47:27.835 --> 47:29.632
I find that
curiously refreshing.

47:43.017 --> 47:45.611
Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain.
Course laid in.

47:45.686 --> 47:46.948
Very good,
Mr. Spock.

47:47.021 --> 47:49.455
Chief Engineer Vanderberg
standing by on channel 1.

47:49.523 --> 47:50.455
Fine.

47:50.524 --> 47:52.048
Yes, Chief.
Kirk here.

47:52.126 --> 47:55.095
Just wanted to tell you
the eggs are hatching.

47:55.162 --> 47:58.325
First thing the little devils do
is start to tunnel.

47:58.399 --> 48:00.959
We've already hit
huge new pergium deposits.

48:01.035 --> 48:03.629
I'm afraid to tell you
how much gold, platinum,

48:03.704 --> 48:05.672
and rare ores
we've uncovered.

48:05.739 --> 48:07.570
I'm delighted
to hear that, Chief.

48:07.641 --> 48:10.075
Once Mother Horta tells her kids
what to look for,

48:10.144 --> 48:11.805
you'll all be
embarrassingly rich.

48:11.879 --> 48:15.007
The Horta aren't so bad once
you're used to their appearance.

48:15.082 --> 48:17.550
That's about it, Kirk.
Thanks for everything.

48:17.618 --> 48:19.552
Our pleasure, Chief.
Kirk out.

48:19.620 --> 48:22.418
Curious. What Chief Vanderberg
said about the Horta

48:22.489 --> 48:25.947
is exactly what
the Mother Horta said to me.

48:26.026 --> 48:27.960
She found humanoid
appearance revolting,

48:28.028 --> 48:31.464
but she thought
she could get used to it.

48:31.532 --> 48:33.261
Oh, she did,
did she?

48:33.333 --> 48:36.791
Did she happen to make any comment
about those ears?

48:36.870 --> 48:37.837
Not specifically.

48:37.905 --> 48:40.430
But I did get
the distinct impression

48:40.507 --> 48:44.500
she found them the most attractive
human characteristic of all.

48:44.578 --> 48:47.445
I couldn't bear to tell
her that only I have--

48:47.514 --> 48:49.948
She really liked
those ears?

48:50.017 --> 48:54.818
Captain, the Horta is a remarkably
intelligent and sensitive creature

48:54.888 --> 48:56.321
with impeccable taste.

48:56.390 --> 48:58.381
Because she approved
of you.

48:58.459 --> 49:00.222
Really, Captain,
my modesty...

49:00.294 --> 49:02.728
Does not bear close
examination, Mr. Spock.

49:02.796 --> 49:06.459
I suspect you're becoming
more and more human all the time.

49:06.533 --> 49:07.397
You...

49:09.136 --> 49:13.334
Captain, I see no reason
to stand here and be insulted.

49:15.742 --> 49:17.573
Ahead, warp factor 2.
