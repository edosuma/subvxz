00:31.710 --> 00:33.187
Oh, crap!

00:33.255 --> 00:36.264
What's going on? Is it the smoke detector? Are we on fire?

00:36.336 --> 00:37.933
It's not the smoke detector, it's the alarm!

00:38.169 --> 00:39.730
- What alarm? 
- Our alarm.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.088
We don't have an alarm.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.369
Then, we have really angry rats. Did you cut your hair?

00:44.887 --> 00:46.413
I just trimmed it.

00:46.668 --> 00:48.476
You didn't tell me you were cutting your hair.

00:48.578 --> 00:49.806
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

00:49.915 --> 00:53.289
A spur-of-the-moment, "let's not tell my mother I'm pulling a G.I. Jane"?

00:53.417 --> 00:56.500
Are we seriously gonna have this conversation now during the air raid?

00:56.582 --> 00:57.364
You're right. Come on.

00:57.693 --> 00:58.389
What are we doing?

00:58.578 --> 01:01.702
I figured out that there is a motion detector, and if you stand over here,

01:01.789 --> 01:03.202
it can't see you and calms down.

01:03.816 --> 01:06.213
- Great, so what now? 
- We wait.

01:07.954 --> 01:09.592
So why didn't you tell me you were getting your hair cut?

01:09.685 --> 01:12.520
- It's just a trim. 
- To the Braille Institute, it's just a trim.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.549
- Do you like it? 
- Will you put it back if I don't?

01:14.636 --> 01:15.182
Mom!

01:15.378 --> 01:16.668
- Yes, I like it. 
- Thank you.

01:17.719 --> 01:19.428
Oh, thank God.

01:19.966 --> 01:21.235
Feels good when it's over, huh?

01:21.430 --> 01:23.264
This is crazy. When did we get an alarm?

01:23.452 --> 01:24.877
- Well, apparently, Kirk... 
- Oh, no.

01:24.979 --> 01:27.491
...has recently joined the Stars Hollow Security Company. 

01:27.593 --> 01:30.530
And apparently, now that I'm the pretty spinster living all alone,

01:30.596 --> 01:33.171
- he's concerned for my safety. 
- Did he tell you all this?

01:33.253 --> 01:35.383
Do you think I labeled myself the pretty spinster?

01:35.547 --> 01:37.508
- What did you say? 
- I haven't talked to him face-to-face.

01:37.611 --> 01:42.343
I come home to this and there was a note and his card and his gun.

01:42.480 --> 01:43.397
Oh, jeez!

01:43.561 --> 01:46.208
Yeah, and then when I called the alarm-response center to complain about the alarm,

01:46.361 --> 01:47.458
no one answered.

01:47.723 --> 01:51.272
I had to leave a message with Meg - she sweeps up.

01:51.369 --> 01:53.849
I can't even believe there's a security company in Stars Hollow.

01:53.944 --> 01:55.142
Nothing ever happens here.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.946
- Oh, that is not true. Plenty happens here.
- Like what?

01:58.042 --> 02:01.206
Like, people now break into your houses and install alarm systems.

02:01.385 --> 02:02.281
I heard about that.

02:02.404 --> 02:03.724
- And we have a new mail carrier. 
- We do?

02:03.797 --> 02:05.900
Yeah, so now if you wanna get your mail, you just have to go see Miss Patty.

02:06.018 --> 02:07.467
- Why? 
- 'Cause that's where he brings it.

02:07.622 --> 02:10.068
He brings Babette's mail to Andrew's, Norma's mail to the deli,

02:10.238 --> 02:13.111
and Taylor still hasn't found his mail, which I have to admit is kind of fun.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.233
I rescind my previous statement. This place is hopping.

02:15.810 --> 02:17.703
- So, did you eat yet? 
- Nope.

02:17.856 --> 02:19.398
- I thought I'd let you feed me. 
- Sure.

02:19.654 --> 02:22.440
I can feed you, but I can't know if you're getting your hair cut.

02:22.589 --> 02:25.051
I will never do anything again without telling you - happy?

02:25.163 --> 02:27.545
I don't know. I'm finding this whole guilt thing rather satisfying.

02:27.857 --> 02:28.825
No, no, where are you going?

02:29.634 --> 02:32.096
- Why did you do that? 
- I was gonna get my laundry!

02:32.455 --> 02:34.596
- You made it mad! 
- I didn't mean to!

02:34.760 --> 02:36.111
Back in the corner, back in the corner!

02:39.645 --> 02:42.031
- No place like home, huh? 
- Yeah.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.776
- Mom? 
- Follow the Post-It's.

03:48.784 --> 03:50.842
Does our life seem at all ridiculous to you?

03:50.975 --> 03:53.890
I spent all morning carefully tracking that motion detector.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.722
What an excellent use of your time.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.314
We're good as long as we stay on the path.

03:57.728 --> 03:59.541
So I should follow the yellow stick road?

04:00.412 --> 04:02.891
We'll be here all week, try the veal. Stop.

04:03.121 --> 04:04.217
- What? 
- Read.

04:04.893 --> 04:07.120
"Crouch down and hop." Oh, come on.

04:07.401 --> 04:11.021
The motion-detector beam at the top of the staircase dips very low over there.

04:11.113 --> 04:12.811
You seriously want me to crouch down and hop?

04:12.906 --> 04:14.360
Like a little hunchbacked bunny.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.911
You know, I had decided that if I ever went to therapy,

04:18.988 --> 04:21.625
- I was gonna leave you out of it, but now... 
- Okay, you can stand up.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.447
Did you at least call the stupid security company again?

04:24.571 --> 04:26.187
Yes, Meg sends her love.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.252
Don't worry - I'll stop by on my way to the inn.

04:28.578 --> 04:30.582
And what are your plans today, Persis Khambata?

04:30.808 --> 04:33.464
Well, today, I'm going to do nothing but hang out in town,

04:33.628 --> 04:36.925
read, veg, drink coffee, and have the perfect Stars Hollow day.

04:37.099 --> 04:40.080
Look out. I get to go over to the inn

04:40.182 --> 04:42.681
and hear a contractor laugh at me every time I say,

04:42.746 --> 04:44.216
"But that won't cost too much more, right?"

04:44.294 --> 04:45.773
- Enjoy. 
- Late lunch at Luke's?

04:45.891 --> 04:46.470
You're on.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.896
So, which way do I go?

04:49.254 --> 04:50.936
Oh, just follow the Post-It's.

04:51.031 --> 04:52.521
But they're going in two different directions.

04:52.859 --> 04:53.941
- They are? 
- Look.

04:54.144 --> 04:56.781
Oh. I must have kicked some out of the way by accident.

04:56.885 --> 04:58.851
- Well, which one do I take? 
- Which looks more intentional?

04:59.061 --> 05:01.928
- No Post-It path looks intentional. 
- I'm drawing a complete blank.

05:02.024 --> 05:03.622
- You seriously don't remember? 
- Sorry.

05:04.026 --> 05:05.999
Well, how are we supposed to get out of our house?

05:09.266 --> 05:10.330
I hate Kirk.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.569
Whoa. What's going on?

05:34.728 --> 05:36.064
I'm just setting things up for tomorrow.

05:36.383 --> 05:38.277
- Oh, tomorrow. What's... 
- Heads up!

05:40.862 --> 05:41.898
I think you may need to move.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.743
Yeah, I kinda got that. Excuse me. What's tomorrow?

05:45.241 --> 05:47.785
...tons of tulle so that everything looks like frosting.

05:48.261 --> 05:50.401
She's our only daughter - frost the town.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.981
Now, where should we put the poster? I want to make sure everybody sees it.

05:54.109 --> 05:56.838
- Oh, what about next to the cake? 
- Yes, next to the cake.

06:03.016 --> 06:04.478
- Lane. 
- Rory.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.997
Have you heard of a phone? Because as my friend,

06:07.212 --> 06:09.781
it is your responsibility to use it to call me and tell me

06:09.885 --> 06:13.360
that my ex-boyfriend's wedding is on Sunday so I'm not accidentally in it.

06:13.500 --> 06:13.990
What?

06:14.299 --> 06:16.270
I'm sitting out in the gazebo, reading,

06:16.474 --> 06:19.501
and this guy almost brains me with a stack of tablecloths.

06:19.644 --> 06:22.280
Oh, that's right, they're having their reception in the town square.

06:22.490 --> 06:26.950
Yes, and Lindsay was out there holding a giant picture of her with Dean, and...

06:27.114 --> 06:28.205
Oh my God, did she see you?

06:28.363 --> 06:30.582
I don't think so. I do a pretty good idiot run when I need to.

06:30.704 --> 06:33.755
I'm sorry, I meant to tell you. I just didn't know you were coming home this weekend.

06:33.843 --> 06:36.325
It totally slipped my mind. Things have been so crazy.

06:36.428 --> 06:39.454
I just figured I'd tell you when we talked, and then we didn't, and...

06:39.972 --> 06:41.451
oh, I'm sorry, can you hold on for a sec?

06:45.573 --> 06:47.247
- Not cool, Lane. 
- I'm sorry, guys.

06:47.498 --> 06:50.228
- Fourth time today. 
- Well, I thought Rory was my mom.

06:50.391 --> 06:51.856
The resemblance is uncanny.

06:52.066 --> 06:53.933
We should get your mom a bell like a cat.

06:54.175 --> 06:56.131
- What's going on? 
- We're having a band meeting.

06:56.223 --> 06:59.209
- We need to figure out what to do about a guitarist. 
- I think I got a splinter.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.651
You know that a splinter can get into your bloodstream,

07:01.717 --> 07:03.049
go straight to your heart, and kill you.

07:03.228 --> 07:04.169
Why would you tell me that?

07:04.385 --> 07:07.395
- Whatever, dude. This is lame. I'm gonna bail. 
- Zach, come on.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.131
- We need to find a guitarist. 
- That's right.

07:09.270 --> 07:12.173
We have come too far to let the band fall apart just because Dave...

07:12.280 --> 07:14.953
Hey, do not say the "d" word, Lane.

07:15.035 --> 07:15.798
- But... 
- Don't.

07:15.896 --> 07:17.058
- Dave... 
- Dave is dead to me.

07:17.252 --> 07:21.334
Comprendo? Dead. Cover the mirror, rip a shirt, that guy doesn't exist.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.113
- He just went to college, Zach. 
- No, he did not just go to college.

07:24.216 --> 07:25.674
He walked out on his art, man.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.396
He walked out on his sound.

07:27.810 --> 07:31.093
Do you think a sound is so easy to find? Did you ever see that Glenn Miller movie?

07:31.226 --> 07:33.351
For two hours, Jimmy Stewart's walking around,

07:33.494 --> 07:36.264
"I gotta find a sound. I gotta find a sound."

07:36.535 --> 07:39.608
We had a sound and Dave took that sound to freaking California.

07:39.761 --> 07:42.741
You don't come back from California, man. It changes you.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.682
What did you expect him to do - not go to college?

07:44.763 --> 07:46.749
No true rock 'n' roller goes to college!

07:46.859 --> 07:48.706
Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics.

07:48.963 --> 07:49.586
What?

07:49.731 --> 07:54.988
Yeah, and, Dexter Holland of The Offspring got his PhD in molecular biology at USC.

07:55.162 --> 07:57.549
Greg Ginn of Black Flag graduated from UCLA.

07:57.713 --> 08:01.319
The guy from Bad Religion got his masters in geology from UCLA,

08:01.414 --> 08:05.055
and he's working on his PhD in evolutionary biology at Cornell.

08:05.408 --> 08:06.859
Lane, she's your friend.

08:07.263 --> 08:08.967
I'm sorry. I'm going. I'll call you later.

08:10.255 --> 08:12.772
Hey, are you mad?

08:12.936 --> 08:14.097
No, I'm not, I promise.

08:14.282 --> 08:17.918
I'm just... a little surprised. I mean, Dean's wedding...

08:18.353 --> 08:20.580
- I know. 
- But it's okay.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.888
It just means that I have to be a little more careful about where I go this weekend, that's all.

08:24.011 --> 08:25.419
Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow.

08:25.701 --> 08:28.512
- We're using the garage - guitar auditions. 
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

08:28.794 --> 08:31.701
Shut up, shut up, shut up. Weezer did not go to Harvard.

08:31.835 --> 08:34.620
- Not the whole band, just the lead... 
- Get away from me! I mean it.

08:35.942 --> 08:37.933
- Bye. 
- Bye.

08:50.975 --> 08:54.355
- Were you... 
- Oh, I was at Lane's.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.348
Right, Lane's.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.480
So, you're home this weekend.

08:58.768 --> 09:02.495
Yeah, I ran out of clean clothes and quarters, so...

09:03.397 --> 09:06.023
- How are things? 
- Good. You?

09:06.591 --> 09:08.057
- Good. 
- You like Yale?

09:08.174 --> 09:09.356
- I love Yale. 
- I figured.

09:09.622 --> 09:11.645
- And Connecticut State? 
- It's good.

09:11.921 --> 09:13.663
Oh, good. I'm glad it's good.

09:13.775 --> 09:16.166
I mean, not that I would have had any recourse if it wasn't, but...

09:16.248 --> 09:18.777
this makes my lack of recourse a lot easier to deal with.

09:19.695 --> 09:21.476
So, I see you've taken over the town.

09:21.660 --> 09:25.127
Oh, yeah. Lindsay thought... she likes the gazebo, and...

09:25.262 --> 09:26.689
- And it's her wedding. 
- It is her wedding.

09:26.822 --> 09:28.716
And your wedding. I mean, it's your wedding, too.

09:28.809 --> 09:31.097
Yes, it is. It's my wedding, too.

09:31.323 --> 09:33.877
Well, it's nice. It's... it's pretty.

09:34.128 --> 09:37.005
It looks like heaven or a Victoria's Secret commercial,

09:37.087 --> 09:38.875
which, to some people is basically the same thing.

09:39.643 --> 09:41.537
I didn't know you'd be home this weekend.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.668
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

09:43.883 --> 09:47.447
Because if I had known, I would have, you know, invited you.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.725
Oh. Oh, well, it's...

09:49.833 --> 09:52.511
I mean, I didn't want you to think I was just not inviting you.

09:52.663 --> 09:55.362
- No, I didn't think that. 
- I just figured you'd be at school.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.011
- 'Cause you're logical. 
- I just didn't know.

09:57.099 --> 09:58.706
- No, I know you didn't know. 
- I didn't want you to think...

09:58.833 --> 10:01.901
No, I didn't think. I don't think. I go to Yale now. They think for you.

10:04.595 --> 10:08.742
- But, hey, since you are here, come. 
- Come?

10:08.828 --> 10:10.140
To my wedding. Come to my wedding.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.309
- Oh, Dean... 
- You and Lorelai, I want you to.

10:13.401 --> 10:14.491
- Well... 
- Chicken or beef?

10:14.584 --> 10:16.485
- What? 
- Wait, beef.

10:16.781 --> 10:19.914
Of course, beef. I mean, the two of you are definitely beef.

10:20.406 --> 10:22.582
I mean, not like you resemble beef or anything.

10:22.684 --> 10:26.125
- You know, you don't even have to... 
- Okay, so, noon at the church.

10:26.489 --> 10:27.666
I'll be the one in the tux.

10:28.327 --> 10:31.410
And don't worry, we didn't write our own vows and no one's singing opera.

10:31.553 --> 10:33.826
- I know you think that's lame. 
- Oh, no, well, it's a wedding.

10:33.944 --> 10:36.422
It's supposed to be... operatic.

10:36.575 --> 10:39.131
Okay, so, I better get over there. Lindsay's expecting me.

10:39.299 --> 10:41.548
So, I'll just see you two tomorrow.

10:42.207 --> 10:42.782
But...

10:49.976 --> 10:51.026
- Now? 
- Nothing.

10:52.162 --> 10:54.067
- What about now? 
- No, nothing.

10:55.101 --> 10:58.036
- Okay. Now? 
- Nothing.

10:58.163 --> 10:59.802
Kirk, what's supposed to happen?

11:00.753 --> 11:01.241
What?

11:01.477 --> 11:03.192
I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for.

11:05.193 --> 11:06.329
- Kirk? 
- I'm not sure.

11:07.533 --> 11:10.150
- Kirk, please come downstairs. 
- Are you going to hurt me?

11:10.584 --> 11:11.332
Kirk.

11:12.094 --> 11:14.195
I swear, they told me it would be self-explanatory.

11:14.271 --> 11:17.872
I just had to get in the main box, and in seconds, this thing would be disabled.

11:18.086 --> 11:20.636
They didn't tell me that I needed a key or that if I didn't have a key,

11:20.780 --> 11:23.830
that I would be mildly electrocuted, and then, after all that,

11:24.005 --> 11:26.831
when I got in the box, there's nothing self-explanatory about it.

11:27.272 --> 11:27.706
Kirk.

11:27.968 --> 11:29.638
- I was trying to do a nice thing. 
- I know.

11:29.781 --> 11:33.175
And Jimmy said he would install it for me because I do not have those skills yet.

11:33.268 --> 11:34.779
The class was full by the time I got there.

11:34.896 --> 11:37.041
- That's okay. 
- Damn my constant tardiness.

11:37.149 --> 11:40.375
Kirk, please, what can we do right now? The alarm is just so loud.

11:40.472 --> 11:43.375
Yeah, that's my fault, too. I asked Jimmy to really crank it up.

11:43.463 --> 11:44.241
Well, he did.

11:44.398 --> 11:46.038
If you're gonna have an alarm, you need it loud.

11:46.212 --> 11:49.299
You don't want some crazed, knife-wielding gunman at your throat

11:49.387 --> 11:53.205
and the neighbors are going, like, "Is that a fan? Did I leave the water running?"

11:53.355 --> 11:54.978
You want them to know, "Hey, that's an alarm."

11:55.091 --> 11:57.078
Your imaginary attacker has a knife and a gun?

11:57.226 --> 11:59.326
- And a really dirty tank top. 
- Okay.

11:59.417 --> 12:02.750
So, Jimmy's out of town, but until he gets back, we can...

12:02.869 --> 12:05.179
- Change the code. 
- Really? To something I know?

12:05.340 --> 12:07.144
- You can pick it. 
- You know how to do that?

12:07.251 --> 12:08.798
- Yes, I do. 
- That is perfect.

12:09.556 --> 12:11.977
Okay, here we go. Just punch in a 7-number sequence.

12:12.193 --> 12:12.909
You got it.

12:14.644 --> 12:16.985
- Did you know your phone's not working? 
- What?

12:17.254 --> 12:19.699
I've been calling you for an hour. I had the operator check it.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.089
- She said it's cut off or something. 
- It was working this morning.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.872
- I'll be right back. 
- Kirk!

12:24.035 --> 12:24.840
I have tape.

12:25.126 --> 12:27.226
- You look tired. 
- Yeah, well, Kirk.

12:27.548 --> 12:29.945
Right. Hey, listen, I got a call today.

12:30.191 --> 12:33.237
- From? 
- Michel. A very upset Michel.

12:33.426 --> 12:33.949
Why?

12:34.369 --> 12:36.836
Apparently, he called you and you never called him back.

12:37.242 --> 12:38.214
When did he call me?

12:38.628 --> 12:40.108
He said he called you in July.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.814
I was in Europe in July.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.368
I think that he thinks we're trying to ease him out of the Dragonfly.

12:45.504 --> 12:46.939
Oh, come on. Why would he think that?

12:47.128 --> 12:49.053
I don't know, but he was so hysterical

12:49.263 --> 12:51.732
that his voice got into that high-pitched squeal he does,

12:51.824 --> 12:54.441
and all I could make out was "fire" and "abandon me"

12:54.614 --> 12:58.224
and something about not receiving a thank-you card for the Statue of Liberty.

12:58.327 --> 13:00.913
That is crazy. He knows we always intended to take him with us.

13:01.107 --> 13:03.805
I mean, we love Michel, right?

13:03.948 --> 13:07.405
Right. He's the best concierge in the world.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.378
Absolutely.

13:09.596 --> 13:11.337
- A little abrasive. 
- Kind of impatient.

13:11.578 --> 13:14.106
- But charming. 
- And great at what he does, knows the community.

13:14.184 --> 13:18.709
- Willing to go that extra mile. 
- Tiny bit obnoxious.

13:19.295 --> 13:23.078
Makes you want to scream, "life's too short!" two, three times a day, but...

13:23.206 --> 13:24.215
Picture life without him.

13:26.814 --> 13:28.956
We do need him, right?

13:29.089 --> 13:30.805
- Let's just go down there and talk to him. 
- Right.

13:35.408 --> 13:38.332
Well, we know where all those Calvin Klein ads went to die.

13:38.786 --> 13:40.384
They look like they all had the same mother.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.335
That must be one tired supermodel.

13:42.586 --> 13:43.635
Excuse me, we're look...

13:44.389 --> 13:45.409
I wouldn't talk to us either.

13:45.714 --> 13:47.656
Hey, talk to a boy. A boy will be nice to you.

13:50.573 --> 13:52.786
Excuse me, we're looking for Michel Gerard.

13:53.206 --> 13:54.814
- The corner of Mercer and Broom. 
- Excuse me?

13:55.858 --> 13:57.932
Oh, Janet Jackson's on the phone.

13:58.142 --> 13:59.914
No worries. Hi.

14:00.411 --> 14:01.464
- Us? 
- Yes.

14:01.845 --> 14:04.211
- We're looking for Michel Gerard. 
- Michel.

14:04.394 --> 14:05.454
Yes, Michel Ger...

14:06.304 --> 14:08.296
- Janet again. 
- She's very needy lately.

14:08.392 --> 14:09.781
You have some guests at the front desk.

14:11.332 --> 14:13.207
No worries. He comes like the wind.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.036
Thanks.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.430
- He doesn't need our thanks. 
- Well, he has Janet, so...

14:18.105 --> 14:20.957
You have reservations at Tamtam at 7:00.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.013
Do not order the duck because it will take forever and you will miss the curtain.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.927
If you have any problems at all, you have my pager number.

14:28.049 --> 14:29.878
Just call me. Goodbye.

14:30.364 --> 14:32.945
Well, look who the cat dragged in.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.265
Hi, Michel. We've missed you.

14:34.405 --> 14:36.637
Yes? Well, I have missed you, too.

14:36.837 --> 14:38.013
This place is wonderful.

14:38.403 --> 14:41.813
You look so important, walking around, talking to yourself.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.902
But you're not really talking to yourself.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.287
You're actually talking to someone else in a headset with your headset.

14:47.368 --> 14:51.578
- How are you? 
- Me? I am wonderful, and yourselves?

14:51.726 --> 14:54.982
We're great, and we're breaking ground on the inn on Monday.

14:55.142 --> 14:58.783
- Oh, yes. Is that still happening? 
- It is still happening.

14:58.895 --> 15:00.293
Well, that's lovely.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.397
There's a small charge for the use of the internet.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.500
All instructions are in the minibar. I'm so pleased.

15:05.629 --> 15:07.394
Listen, Michel, I know you're a little upset with me.

15:07.563 --> 15:10.211
- Upset? I don't think so. 
- It's okay, I told her about the call.

15:10.302 --> 15:12.141
- What call? 
- The call you made to me yesterday,

15:12.254 --> 15:15.628
the one where you told me that you called Lorelai and she didn't call back.

15:15.798 --> 15:18.404
- I make so many calls. 
- The one where you cried.

15:18.823 --> 15:20.892
Are you sure it wasn't another Michel?

15:21.081 --> 15:23.722
You called me! You kept me on the phone for over an hour.

15:23.826 --> 15:26.213
I missed the beginning of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and by the time

15:26.315 --> 15:28.469
- I got back, they were all gay. 
- Okay, it doesn't matter.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.691
We just want you to know if there was any misunderstanding

15:30.804 --> 15:32.863
about wanting you to come with us to the Dragonfly,

15:33.016 --> 15:34.440
- well, we're sorry. 
- I'm not.

15:34.598 --> 15:37.293
Well, that's very sweet of you to say. Thank you.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.691
Unless you don't want to come with us.

15:40.798 --> 15:43.743
I mean, this place is very impressive, and I would understand if you didn't want to leave.

15:43.891 --> 15:46.068
Yes, this place is impressive, isn't it?

15:46.401 --> 15:49.529
I mean, the uniform alone - like working in your jammies.

15:49.674 --> 15:51.797
And these headsets, are they not fabulous?

15:51.981 --> 15:54.926
Especially when, for example, you're in the bathroom,

15:55.085 --> 15:58.141
a place one would normally choose to be alone, then suddenly, bang,

15:58.292 --> 16:01.275
someone is yakking in your ear. How delightful.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.380
- You can never get lonely. 
- I suppose not.

16:03.492 --> 16:06.150
And the people who work here... a joy.

16:06.277 --> 16:11.582
So young, so talented. Some of them are actors in ambitious off-Broadway revues.

16:11.833 --> 16:17.532
They play cockroaches and derelicts and do Shakespeare dressed like punk rockers.

16:17.608 --> 16:19.191
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

16:19.344 --> 16:22.350
Yes, extra towels are complimentary, Matthew, and stop asking me

16:22.432 --> 16:24.429
who the hottie I'm talking to is. I'll tell you what,

16:24.629 --> 16:27.256
I'll think about it and get back to you, okay?

16:27.475 --> 16:29.760
- Nice to have you aboard, Michel. 
- I'm busy, go.

16:34.035 --> 16:34.802
Thank God.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.580
Matthew, what?

16:37.379 --> 16:40.236
- So, he invited us to his wedding. 
- And we're having beef.

16:40.590 --> 16:43.160
- What was his body language like? 
- Tall.

16:43.299 --> 16:46.390
No, I mean, did he squirm or back away

16:46.462 --> 16:48.172
when he invited you or was he all darty-eyed?

16:48.592 --> 16:52.862
Not much squirming, no backing away, but there was a little bit of darty-eye.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.248
- So, he was nervous. 
- Well, we were both nervous.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.623
I mean, we didn't expect to run into each other, and I think he probably just invited us

16:58.710 --> 17:01.444
- 'cause he felt like he had to, to be nice. 
- That does sound like Dean.

17:01.516 --> 17:02.714
So, what do we do? Do we go?

17:02.945 --> 17:05.196
Oh, I can't decide this. He's your ex-boyfriend.

17:05.296 --> 17:07.814
- It seems weird that we go. 
- Then we don't go.

17:07.968 --> 17:11.377
But if we don't go, it may look like we're trying to make some kind of statement.

17:11.473 --> 17:12.202
Then we go.

17:12.272 --> 17:14.506
If I had just stayed at Lane's for two more minutes...

17:14.624 --> 17:16.897
- Yeah, fate. 
- Yes, it is fate.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.874
- Do we ignore fate? 
- I don't know.

17:18.986 --> 17:20.834
- Do you have any important papers due soon? 
- Why?

17:20.901 --> 17:22.238
- Just in case. 
- Fate's gonna flunk me?

17:22.304 --> 17:24.133
- It's always a possibility. 
- Well, then that's it. We are going.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.523
- Going where? 
- Dean's wedding. Fate's making us.

17:26.603 --> 17:29.601
I hope fate will cough up forty bucks for a salad spinner for him.

17:29.693 --> 17:30.973
Please, there is no fate.

17:31.076 --> 17:34.128
What do you mean there is no fate? Of course there is fate.

17:34.245 --> 17:37.128
There is no fate, there is no destiny, there is no luck.

17:37.211 --> 17:39.073
Astrology is ridiculous.

17:39.176 --> 17:41.635
Tarot cards tell you nothing. You cannot read a palm.

17:41.716 --> 17:43.620
Tea leaves make tea and nothing else.

17:43.703 --> 17:47.825
Jim Morrison is not hanging out with Elvis, and the Kennedys did not kill Marilyn.

17:47.947 --> 17:50.763
- I totally knew you were gonna say that. 
- I came over here. My fault.

17:50.882 --> 17:53.406
I read your mind. It spoke to me. We're psychic.

17:53.549 --> 17:54.425
Enjoy the fries.

17:55.106 --> 17:56.074
So where does this leave us?

17:56.191 --> 17:59.729
Well, I think that Dean's gonna expect us to go, and it is his day,

17:59.822 --> 18:01.795
and I don't want him to feel like I don't care about him.

18:01.901 --> 18:03.928
- I know. 
- I just want him to be happy.

18:04.221 --> 18:07.272
Okay, we'll get him a salad spinner first thing tomorrow morning.

18:07.425 --> 18:08.024
Thank you.

18:09.674 --> 18:13.078
- Oh, there you are. Honey, I've got your mail. 
- Oh, great.

18:13.329 --> 18:17.866
Oh, I'm exhausted. I've been looking all over town for you.

18:18.029 --> 18:19.734
Oh, Patty, you could have just left me a message.

18:19.816 --> 18:20.774
I would have stopped by and picked it up.

18:20.886 --> 18:22.745
Oh, there was something marked urgent in there,

18:22.847 --> 18:24.112
and I just wanted to make sure you got it.

18:25.120 --> 18:25.905
Thank you.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.650
All right, I'm leaving.

18:27.977 --> 18:32.407
Oh, I'm gonna kill that mail carrier. I don't care if he doesn't have a tongue.

18:33.164 --> 18:35.126
Our new mail carrier doesn't have a tongue?

18:35.560 --> 18:37.621
- You've got to be kidding me. 
- That's what Patty just said.

18:37.737 --> 18:40.732
No, Taylor has sent me a cease and desist order on the inn.

18:40.979 --> 18:41.532
What?

18:41.753 --> 18:43.336
"Dear Lorelai Gilmore, it has come to the attention

18:43.432 --> 18:46.265
of the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society that you and Miss Sookie St. James 

18:46.358 --> 18:49.033
intend to commence construction on the Dragonfly Inn.

18:49.181 --> 18:52.392
Any proposed renovations must be submitted, discussed, and approved

18:52.443 --> 18:54.465
by the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society.

18:54.573 --> 18:57.307
We must therefore ask that all work halt until such time

18:57.363 --> 18:58.486
that this procedure has been followed. 

18:58.583 --> 19:01.675
- Thank you, and have a historical day." Is he kidding? 
- What are you gonna do?

19:02.972 --> 19:05.346
- I'm going to talk to him. 
- Cool.

19:05.581 --> 19:07.225
Don't say cool like that. It's gonna be very pleasant.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.711
I thought you said you were gonna go talk to Taylor.

19:08.827 --> 19:10.631
I own my own business now, Rory.

19:10.728 --> 19:13.432
I'm gonna have to deal with tiny men like Taylor all the time.

19:13.590 --> 19:17.188
You can't go around yelling at people, no matter how historical they might be.

19:17.282 --> 19:17.840
Bummer.

19:18.337 --> 19:21.234
You have to learn to separate the personal from the business.

19:22.393 --> 19:27.133
Remember in The Godfather, Michael telling Sonny how he was gonna kill Tattaglia

19:27.199 --> 19:29.084
and Captain McCluskey in that Italian restaurant?

19:29.202 --> 19:32.442
He lays out the whole thing very calmly, very unemotionally,

19:32.556 --> 19:34.025
'cause that's what you do in business.

19:34.139 --> 19:35.940
Yeah, but then he went and shot two guys in the head.

19:36.533 --> 19:38.162
Okay, but I wasn't describing that scene.

19:38.454 --> 19:42.576
But if you know you already like lime, then you're not sampling,

19:42.692 --> 19:45.402
you're savoring, and that's just gluttonous.

19:47.046 --> 19:49.790
- Hi, Taylor. 
- Well, hello there.

19:49.876 --> 19:51.675
Lorelai, Rory, what can I get for you?

19:51.972 --> 19:55.837
Oh, well, gosh, look at all the choices, really hard to pick.

19:56.018 --> 19:59.529
I think I'll try a scoop of butter brickle crunch. Rory?

19:59.703 --> 20:02.094
- I'll try the chocolate chocolate chocolate. 
- Coming right up.

20:02.226 --> 20:03.918
Listen, Taylor, while I have you here,

20:04.029 --> 20:08.183
I received this letter in the mail, and I'm having kind of a blond day,

20:08.315 --> 20:09.785
and I wonder if you could explain this to me.

20:09.892 --> 20:14.117
Well, it says you have to get approval before you can start construction on the inn.

20:14.193 --> 20:15.396
That's what I thought it said.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.769
I have to tell you, Taylor, I'm a little concerned

20:17.892 --> 20:21.598
because we have a construction crew coming Monday, so... yikes.

20:21.705 --> 20:24.660
The Dragonfly is a historical building, Lorelai.

20:24.804 --> 20:27.357
Yeah, but the whole town is a historical building, Taylor.

20:27.455 --> 20:31.147
I mean, George Washington ate, slept, or blew his nose all over the damn place.

20:31.265 --> 20:33.589
He only blew his nose in the park. You've read the sign.

20:33.712 --> 20:36.206
Taylor, that inn needs love. It's falling down.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.083
Sookie and I have no intention of ruining its historical aspect.

20:39.257 --> 20:43.037
- We'd just like some running water. 
- Running water was not always historical.

20:43.134 --> 20:44.987
You're not seriously telling me I can't put in running water?

20:45.145 --> 20:47.849
Oh, my God, this is incredible.

20:47.968 --> 20:49.596
It's called chocolate chocolate chocolate,

20:49.723 --> 20:52.631
but it's seriously chocolate chocolate chocolaty.

20:53.508 --> 20:54.157
Sorry.

20:55.008 --> 20:57.527
I'm just telling you, there are rules and they have to be followed.

20:58.203 --> 20:59.089
Fine.

20:59.796 --> 21:04.660
What do I have to do to get the Historical Preservation Society's stamp of approval?

21:04.797 --> 21:08.207
- Well, a formal presentation is necessary. 
- When?

21:08.422 --> 21:12.346
Any town function or gathering is open to a presentation, Lorelai.

21:12.483 --> 21:14.905
- Okay, so, like, the town meeting tonight? 
- If you like.

21:15.505 --> 21:18.617
- The town meeting it is. 
- Oh, now, don't look sad.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.795
I went through this with my place, too.

21:20.896 --> 21:24.311
Of course, I knew the rules so I didn't get the embarrassing letter.

21:24.582 --> 21:27.123
Right, okay, great. Well, we'll see you later, Taylor.

21:29.344 --> 21:29.892
Yes?

21:30.316 --> 21:31.522
That'll be $3.50 for the ice cream.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.359
And worth every penny, let me tell you.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.617
Sorry, but this is really good.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.923
So, any additional landscaping to the town square

21:40.036 --> 21:42.852
will be paid for directly from the town park funds,

21:42.918 --> 21:46.712
and town park funds only. All righty.

21:48.489 --> 21:50.512
- Long one tonight. 
- Astonishingly long.

21:50.649 --> 21:52.400
- We've got to be next, right? 
- We've got to be.

21:53.988 --> 21:55.161
Michel, are you okay over there?

21:55.381 --> 21:57.563
He says the guy next to him has unforgivable B.O.

21:57.752 --> 21:59.196
Michel, you're French. How can you even tell?

21:59.340 --> 22:00.649
Could we have a little quiet please?

22:00.799 --> 22:03.297
Sorry, Taylor, we're just waiting here very patiently,

22:03.486 --> 22:05.397
as you can see, all ready and everything.

22:05.725 --> 22:10.681
Yes, well, the next item, people, is a wonderful feather in Stars Hollow's cap.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.528
One of our very own, fourth grader Donny Pass,

22:13.677 --> 22:17.788
was named a runner-up in the Connecticut State story-writing contest

22:17.905 --> 22:21.146
for his work entitled The Happiest Doughnut.

22:21.347 --> 22:23.164
I think I'm gonna give birth just out of boredom.

22:23.287 --> 22:26.053
Donny's mom is here tonight. Let's give her a big hand.

22:27.962 --> 22:29.170
I almost think he's doing this on purpose.

22:29.902 --> 22:32.109
- Almost? 
- Bordering on pretty damn sure.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.375
I won't spoil the plot of The Happiest Doughnut for you, folks,

22:35.463 --> 22:38.971
except to say it's funny and a little sad and truly inspiring.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.510
But a caveat for all you parents -

22:41.674 --> 22:44.895
the dunking scene may be too intense for preschool-aged children.

22:45.033 --> 22:46.779
How can a stupid doughnut be happy?

22:47.065 --> 22:50.133
But see, he's got you curious. That's the genius of Donny Pass.

22:50.614 --> 22:52.473
Hey, I've got a bunch of your mail. Here.

22:52.674 --> 22:54.669
Oh, I've got some of yours, too, and some of Al's.

22:55.545 --> 22:57.670
Will you pass this back to him for me?

22:57.864 --> 23:00.701
- Yeah. Oh, if you hand this up to Andrew. 
- Can do.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.375
I can't smell anything.

23:09.718 --> 23:12.566
I'm breathing it all in so it's not reaching you.

23:13.247 --> 23:14.879
Thanks for taking that grenade for me, pal.

23:15.064 --> 23:17.475
People, could we have some order here?

23:17.691 --> 23:20.225
Oh, Gypsy, the letter from my girlfriend's open.

23:20.456 --> 23:23.818
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Andrew. It must have fallen open accidentally.

23:23.963 --> 23:26.507
- You read my private letter. 
- There's nothing private in that letter.

23:27.071 --> 23:28.316
Except for the medical stuff.

23:28.489 --> 23:31.095
Taylor, I got your PennySaver and your girly magazines.

23:31.582 --> 23:33.800
Those are lifestyle magazines.

23:34.377 --> 23:38.336
People, this meeting has degenerated into our usual weekly anarchy.

23:38.422 --> 23:40.460
I say we adjourn. We'll see you next week.

23:40.588 --> 23:41.890
- What? 
- Taylor!

23:42.017 --> 23:45.330
Everyone pick up a free copy of The Happiest Doughnut on your way out.

23:45.462 --> 23:46.661
- You won't be sorry. 
- Taylor, wait,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.041
we were supposed to make our presentation about the Dragonfly.

23:49.186 --> 23:51.801
Oh, yes. Well, you're bringing this up kind of late.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.537
- We've been sitting here. 
- It won't take long.

23:53.676 --> 23:56.118
It was your idea, remember? You suggested this.

23:56.378 --> 23:58.043
Well, okay.

23:58.608 --> 24:01.854
People, your children and elderly are going to have to wait

24:01.940 --> 24:05.590
a while longer for you to get home because Lorelai Gilmore and her associates

24:05.765 --> 24:11.265
want to discuss some proposed changes to a beloved town structure.

24:11.357 --> 24:13.487
Thank you. Let's go, Sook, Augustus Gloop.

24:13.983 --> 24:14.730
Knock 'em dead.

24:16.758 --> 24:20.158
Guys, I know we've been here forever, but I very quickly want to tell you

24:20.349 --> 24:24.602
what we have in mind for this beautiful Dragonfly property.

24:24.741 --> 24:27.393
- The historic Dragonfly property. 
- I think that goes without saying.

24:27.506 --> 24:30.091
I don't think you should try to hide the fact that it's historic.

24:30.215 --> 24:32.513
- Okay, I'm not hiding anything. 
- Proceed, please.

24:32.801 --> 24:36.946
- Okay, well, we're very excited... 
- How many guest rooms will this establishment have?

24:37.563 --> 24:38.216
Ten.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.438
Yeah, ten. Anyway, the property's been unoccupied for...

24:42.554 --> 24:44.469
And parking? How many parking spaces?

24:45.124 --> 24:45.959
Eighteen.

24:47.313 --> 24:49.052
Something wrong with the parking, Taylor?

24:49.176 --> 24:51.623
Two people to a room, each with their own car,

24:51.735 --> 24:53.388
that's twenty cars - you don't have enough parking.

24:53.507 --> 24:56.086
But some of the people will be driving there together in one car.

24:56.513 --> 24:59.508
- So, you have a crystal ball, do you? 
- That's just common sense.

24:59.560 --> 25:03.517
Because if you have a crystal ball, I sure would like to borrow it to take to the racetrack.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.449
No, I don't have a crystal ball, but if the parking's not enough,

25:07.521 --> 25:09.323
- we can always add more. 
- Easy.

25:09.442 --> 25:13.010
- So, pave paradise and put up a parking lot. 
- Not what we're saying.

25:13.092 --> 25:15.370
I heard you were planning to serve alcohol - is this true?

25:15.493 --> 25:17.971
- Well, there will be a restaurant. 
- Wine, cocktails.

25:18.115 --> 25:21.392
- Give the people what they want. 
- So it'll be a party spot, huh?

25:21.509 --> 25:25.344
Catering to that crowd - hip-hoppers, the Manson family.

25:25.463 --> 25:26.706
It's a little country inn.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.866
A perfect secluded spot for murderers to revel in impropriety.

25:29.984 --> 25:32.919
Have you noticed, this is not going very well.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.165
Taylor, everyone, there will be millions of questions,

25:35.319 --> 25:39.027
some of them even legitimate, but the bottom line is, you know me.

25:39.195 --> 25:44.777
I've been apart of this town for... well, look how big my daughter is - for that long.

25:44.924 --> 25:49.718
And opening this inn has been a dream of mine and of Sookie's for most of that time.

25:50.086 --> 25:57.085
Along with Michel, we plan to make this community as proud of the historic Dragonfly Inn

25:57.254 --> 26:00.500
as you were when the same team was running the Independence Inn.

26:00.628 --> 26:03.040
You mean the place that burned down on your watch?

26:03.271 --> 26:04.331
Can I slap him?

26:04.710 --> 26:09.216
Now, this will also help our local economy because we plan to employ

26:09.564 --> 26:11.131
Sorry, we plan to employ...

26:13.447 --> 26:16.338
This call is coming from the house.

26:16.628 --> 26:18.437
- Our house? 
- It's flashing our number.

26:18.586 --> 26:20.117
- But we're here. 
- I know.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.559
That's the weird part. Sookie, keep it going in here.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.586
I'll be just a quick... second.

26:25.047 --> 26:27.506
Okay, if you have any questions...

26:27.664 --> 26:31.119
Yes, about the Dragonfly or deodorant -

26:31.238 --> 26:34.275
the places to buy it, how to apply it, that sort of thing.

26:35.796 --> 26:38.913
I responded to the activation of an alarm at your residence,

26:38.975 --> 26:41.541
- and I apprehended a prowler in the garage. 
- You did?

26:41.627 --> 26:45.002
Yes, ma'am - female, approximately eighteen years old, Korean.

26:45.247 --> 26:48.048
Kirk, that's Lane. You know Lane.

26:48.161 --> 26:51.305
I thought I knew Lane, but now I think she's in some kind of gang.

26:51.432 --> 26:52.368
Lorelai, help.

26:52.923 --> 26:56.062
- Their front is some sort of musical group. 
- They are a musical group, Kirk.

26:56.185 --> 26:57.613
- Honey, go sort it out. 
- Got it.

26:58.662 --> 27:02.610
Rory's on her way over - brown hair, blue eyes, about 5'6" - don't cuff her.

27:02.739 --> 27:03.952
- 10-4. 
- Okay.

27:04.837 --> 27:05.262
What...

27:05.877 --> 27:08.432
- We failed you. 
- He is a very unpleasant man.

27:08.529 --> 27:09.129
What happened?

27:09.353 --> 27:11.484
The second, I mean, the second you walked out the door,

27:11.586 --> 27:13.824
Taylor adjourned the meeting over our objections.

27:14.264 --> 27:16.799
- Well, where is he? Where'd he go? 
- He was the first one out the door.

27:17.110 --> 27:17.992
Unbelievable.

27:18.955 --> 27:21.503
You can run but you can't hide.

27:22.542 --> 27:26.113
Oh, this is cute... The Happy Doughnut.

27:28.140 --> 27:30.429
Hey, we have a little misunderstanding back there, Taylor?

27:30.510 --> 27:34.217
Lorelai, please don't sneak up on me like that. I almost blew my emergency whistle.

27:34.346 --> 27:35.729
- We weren't done. 
- Oh, I thought we were.

27:35.897 --> 27:37.537
- No, we weren't. 
- Well, what more was there to say?

27:37.710 --> 27:40.010
Nothing was decided. You said to come to the town meeting

27:40.126 --> 27:41.765
and explain what you're doing, then we can start our work.

27:41.872 --> 27:43.497
Oh, well, you can't do that until after the walk-through.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.871
Oh, Taylor, I'm in heels. Do you mind? What walk-through?

27:46.998 --> 27:50.797
I and other members of the Historical Preservation Society need to examine

27:50.930 --> 27:54.238
the property in person. You didn't think we were gonna make a decision

27:54.320 --> 27:57.158
based on a little chat, did you? I'm sure I mentioned a walk-through.

27:57.281 --> 27:59.497
- I don't think you did. 
- Well, I'm mentioning it now.

27:59.691 --> 28:01.196
Okay, so, when's the walk-through?

28:01.499 --> 28:03.740
Well, I'd have to check with the other society members,

28:03.874 --> 28:05.908
set something up in the next month or so.

28:06.055 --> 28:08.745
But I have workmen coming Monday, Taylor, the day after tomorrow.

28:08.898 --> 28:11.084
Oh, dear. That's cutting it pretty close.

28:11.201 --> 28:13.009
Let's do it tomorrow, please - tomorrow.

28:13.168 --> 28:14.637
- Tomorrow's Sunday. 
- Yes, it is.

28:14.792 --> 28:17.050
- Well, it would have to be before church. 
- Okay, so midmorning?

28:17.208 --> 28:19.512
- Six? 
- Six? Six in the morning?

28:19.640 --> 28:21.955
Or another day - I could take it up with the society.

28:22.104 --> 28:24.551
No, no, six is fine. Six sharp.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.466
- See you then. 
- Bright and early.

28:28.411 --> 28:29.675
- Goodnight. 
- Goodnight. Thanks.

28:30.602 --> 28:33.471
We do or die for Stars Hollow High!

28:33.762 --> 28:37.376
We do or die for Stars Hollow High!

28:37.633 --> 28:40.813
It's the one we fight and fall for,

28:41.059 --> 28:44.238
- it's the one we give our all for. 
- Oh, goody.

28:44.951 --> 28:50.540
Stars Hollow High! Whoo!

28:51.162 --> 28:53.424
That is our Stars Hollow High fight song.

28:53.542 --> 28:56.261
Could've sworn it was Mozart. What is this, guys?

28:56.378 --> 28:57.230
Pit stop!

28:58.857 --> 29:02.744
- Bachelor party, phase one is over. 
- Our boy Dean here is tying the knot.

29:02.850 --> 29:04.263
Look, I was just closing up.

29:04.414 --> 29:05.713
- Luke! 
- Dean!

29:06.268 --> 29:08.339
- That's funny. 
- I wasn't even trying.

29:08.477 --> 29:11.137
We just need to refuel for phase two, sir. It won't take long.

29:11.345 --> 29:14.008
You wouldn't turn away a man on his wedding day, would you?

29:14.137 --> 29:16.665
- It's not your wedding day yet. 
- That's what I keep telling him, dude.

29:16.778 --> 29:19.994
- It's your last day of freedom. 
- Hey, we should get strippers, right?

29:20.229 --> 29:21.176
And cake.

29:21.555 --> 29:24.653
Hey, my name's Luke, too. We should start a club or something.

29:24.818 --> 29:27.735
Yeah, that would be swell. Look, guys, why don't you go sit down over there?

29:27.924 --> 29:31.002
- I'll make some coffee. 
- Tomorrow is the big day, man - big day.

29:31.119 --> 29:33.245
- You're tipping there, Dean. Watch him. 
- I got him, sir.

29:36.486 --> 29:38.668
- We really appreciate this, sir. 
- Stop calling me that.

29:39.476 --> 29:42.338
- He's a good guy, really. 
- So, what was phase one?

29:42.466 --> 29:46.200
A case of beer in the JC Penney parking lot, then batting cages and laser tag.

29:46.673 --> 29:49.522
I've decided that I really like beer.

29:51.059 --> 29:53.543
- I'm the designated driver. 
- Good man.

29:53.706 --> 29:56.055
- I'm in the Navy now, you know. 
- Uniform tipped me off.

29:56.256 --> 29:59.307
My older cousins did two-year stints. It paid for their college and stuff,

29:59.429 --> 30:02.620
so I joined up. Of course, we weren't fighting international skirmishes

30:02.769 --> 30:05.278
on two or three dangerous fronts like we are now.

30:08.013 --> 30:10.061
Hey, what are you doing?

30:10.444 --> 30:11.781
- Sugar football. 
- Don't.

30:12.097 --> 30:14.408
Come on, guys, respect the establishment.

30:15.549 --> 30:17.866
- They're still kids. 
- I got a better idea, guys.

30:18.043 --> 30:21.980
How about I whip up some pancakes real fast, help soak up whatever it is you drank?

30:22.067 --> 30:24.239
Sounds good. We'll be needing energy for phase two.

30:24.340 --> 30:27.177
Strippers, right? We gotta get strippers.

30:27.315 --> 30:30.802
- Hey, how much do you give a stripper? 
- Well, that depends on what she does.

30:30.947 --> 30:34.561
Are they really prostitutes? 'Cause I'd feel bad if they were prostitutes.

30:34.688 --> 30:36.870
Look, guys, I gotta go in the back for a couple seconds.

30:37.142 --> 30:39.543
Don't drink anymore. Don't play jets.

30:39.691 --> 30:43.148
Don't jump on the furniture. Just sit still, okay?

30:43.603 --> 30:45.154
- And do what? 
- I don't know.

30:45.462 --> 30:47.679
Make up a dirty version of the fight song or something.

30:48.488 --> 30:51.012
- Great idea! 
- Rory.

30:52.215 --> 30:55.084
- What did he say? 
- Oh, he is so toasted.

30:55.441 --> 30:56.159
Rory.

30:56.921 --> 30:59.574
- Did he say what I think he said? 
- Hey guys, you know what I think?

30:59.675 --> 31:03.009
I think it's real late and that maybe you ought to cancel phase two.

31:03.584 --> 31:05.442
- No way. 
- Hear him out, fellas.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.695
I mean, think about it, guys - how you gonna beat laser tag?

31:07.971 --> 31:11.084
- I don't know. 
- Aw, is Dean sick?

31:11.482 --> 31:12.548
He just needs his rest.

31:13.147 --> 31:15.396
Kyle, why don't you march your friends out of here?

31:15.482 --> 31:17.510
I'll take care of the groom, and he'll see you all tomorrow.

31:18.144 --> 31:21.867
- He's right, guys. Let's saddle up. 
- Aren't we getting pancakes?

31:22.389 --> 31:24.622
- I'm not feeling good. 
- Come on, big guy.

31:24.811 --> 31:26.290
- What? 
- Try to walk.

31:30.438 --> 31:31.775
Here we are.

31:33.632 --> 31:35.931
She's smart, man. You know, she's so smart.

31:36.112 --> 31:38.612
- I know, I know. 
- She could probably fix the world, you know?

31:38.733 --> 31:41.561
Right, right. She could team up with Kyle - her brains, his brawn.

31:41.677 --> 31:43.905
- No, not Kyle - Rory. 
- Almost there.

31:44.822 --> 31:45.768
She's the one, you know?

31:46.977 --> 31:49.814
Come on, Dean, just slide down there, stop talking.

31:50.091 --> 31:52.707
And the hair - pretty hair. She has the prettiest hair.

31:53.126 --> 31:55.610
- And that head. What is that? 
- Just your shoes.

31:58.103 --> 31:58.897
I miss her.

32:01.770 --> 32:03.608
Why didn't she love me?

32:14.797 --> 32:16.609
Scrubbing shower grout with a toothbrush.

32:16.870 --> 32:19.491
Sure, sure. Flossing with that really, really fine floss

32:19.618 --> 32:21.058
that cuts between your teeth like a razor.

32:21.901 --> 32:24.125
- Staring into the sun. 
- 'Til you're blind.

32:24.284 --> 32:26.808
- Absolutely. 
- I feel very ugly this morning.

32:27.140 --> 32:27.863
Join the crowd.

32:28.277 --> 32:30.695
That unpleasant man and his cohorts in there?

32:30.838 --> 32:32.298
And have been for about thirty frickin' minutes.

32:32.547 --> 32:34.883
Watching a foreign movie without subtitles.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.735
- Getting brain freeze from eating ice cream. 
- What are you doing?

32:37.909 --> 32:39.983
We're listing all the things we'd rather be doing than this.

32:41.331 --> 32:44.232
- What a mug. 
- It's like he sucked a lemon.

32:44.524 --> 32:46.281
I've really grown to hate him.

32:50.254 --> 32:52.774
- Nice, huh? 
- Oh, so much potential.

32:52.901 --> 32:55.379
It needs a lot of TLC.

32:55.503 --> 32:56.798
And we've got an abundance of it, Taylor.

32:57.565 --> 32:59.394
Patty, please, please, help, help.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.708
He's killing me here, and you've got pull with him.

33:01.949 --> 33:06.229
Oh, honey, I got my own remodeling to do on my studio that Taylor has to approve.

33:06.409 --> 33:07.944
I'm saving my pull for me.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.909
Can't I have just a little teeny, tiny bit of your pull, please?

33:11.063 --> 33:12.881
Oh, he's gonna see us talking.

33:14.483 --> 33:16.419
Lorelai, consultation, please.

33:17.750 --> 33:20.095
- This porch is falling apart. 
- I know.

33:20.285 --> 33:22.385
- It's got live termites. 
- Big, fat ones.

33:22.493 --> 33:24.421
- It's a safety hazard. 
- It's the first thing to go.

33:24.595 --> 33:26.425
To go? This porch can't go.

33:26.941 --> 33:29.112
I'm sorry, Taylor. You just said it's falling apart.

33:29.235 --> 33:32.200
I didn't tell you to tear it down. It's historical. It has to stay.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.062
No, no, the porch is not historical, Taylor. It was added in 1980.

33:35.149 --> 33:37.099
- So? 
- So it's a 23-year-old porch.

33:37.268 --> 33:40.377
Unless you think Kate Hudson is historical, it's not historical.

33:40.494 --> 33:44.592
Not now, but how do you think we get historical 200-year-old structures

33:44.698 --> 33:46.475
if we tear 'em down when they're just 23?

33:46.635 --> 33:47.974
It's rotting away.

33:48.098 --> 33:51.637
- Which just means that your guests can't walk on it. 
- So they should hover over it?

33:51.744 --> 33:54.832
No, you could build a bridge over it, using appropriate materials, of course.

33:54.929 --> 33:55.467
A bridge?

33:55.686 --> 33:59.060
Or you could build a transparent Lucite porch over this porch,

33:59.220 --> 34:01.042
so people could walk on the Lucite porch

34:01.151 --> 34:02.763
and see the old porch underneath the new porch.

34:02.887 --> 34:06.844
Build a clear plastic porch over the rotting wood porch?

34:06.982 --> 34:09.373
With the proper permits, of course, and those are hard to come by.

34:09.690 --> 34:12.399
- That's it! 
- Lorelai, watch it. I've got church later.

34:12.496 --> 34:14.621
What did I do to make you torture me like this, Taylor?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.373
- I don't know what you're talking about. 
- The hoops!

34:16.552 --> 34:19.809
- The hoops with the jumping and the fire and the hoops! 
- It's just business, Lorelai.

34:19.895 --> 34:22.476
I pay to shop in your store. I eat your banana splits.

34:22.572 --> 34:23.766
I've never physically hurt you...

34:23.962 --> 34:26.553
except for that one spit wad in the one town meeting,

34:26.649 --> 34:28.896
but I didn't mean for it to hit your eye and I apologized profusely,

34:28.974 --> 34:31.632
so please, please, put me out of my misery and tell me what I need to do

34:31.703 --> 34:34.038
- to make this thing happen! 
- I want an ice-cream truck.

34:34.226 --> 34:36.699
- What? 
- I want to sell ice cream off a truck in the summer.

34:36.782 --> 34:38.385
I want to park it in front of the soda shop.

34:38.512 --> 34:40.750
I want to ring the bell on it every day at noon,

34:40.838 --> 34:44.212
but the only place I can park it is the space that's partly in front of Luke's diner.

34:44.335 --> 34:46.326
- So? 
- You have pull with Luke.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.795
- I guess, maybe. 
- You're friends.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.809
- Yes. 
- You can get him to agree to this.

34:49.926 --> 34:51.186
- Use my pull. 
- If you don't mind.

34:51.318 --> 34:53.695
So if I get Luke to agree to this, the madness stops?

34:53.813 --> 34:56.056
- If that's what you want to call it. 
- The work begins and the porch goes?

34:56.179 --> 34:58.072
All expedited, nice and neat.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.113
- An ice-cream truck? 
- An ice-cream truck.

35:03.874 --> 35:04.632
You can go.

35:05.037 --> 35:08.093
Well, this has been a very successful outing.

35:08.442 --> 35:11.877
- Back on the bus, everyone. 
- Unbelievable.

35:12.153 --> 35:16.081
Yup. Hey, when do you think you'll... Shortcut to Luke's.

35:16.454 --> 35:18.231
How is she going to get over Potter's Creek?

35:19.010 --> 35:19.648
Jump it?

35:23.980 --> 35:25.696
- Give him his ice-cream truck. 
- What?

35:26.373 --> 35:29.491
I forged a stream and I almost got attacked by a beaver,

35:29.599 --> 35:31.265
- and I'm not leaving here till you agree. 
- To what?

35:31.375 --> 35:33.884
You don't own the street, you own the building.

35:34.212 --> 35:37.356
It's a public street. Just let him park his stupid truck.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.357
- I'm missing something here. 
- Don't change the subject.

35:39.506 --> 35:40.442
I don't even know what the subject is.

35:40.746 --> 35:43.335
If you let Taylor park his stupid ringy-dingy ice-cream truck -

35:43.444 --> 35:45.723
not even in front of the diner, but in front of part of the diner -

35:45.856 --> 35:48.278
then I can start work on the inn. But if you don't say yes,

35:48.420 --> 35:51.182
then you may not have to see his truck parked outside,

35:51.304 --> 35:53.890
but you will have to see my body swinging from that tree over there

35:53.990 --> 35:56.532
because I will hang myself. I am waiting for your answer.

35:57.422 --> 35:58.350
Sure.

36:00.730 --> 36:01.835
Sure what?

36:02.205 --> 36:04.483
- He can park it there. What do I care? 
- Oh, don't kid around here.

36:04.605 --> 36:06.516
Your life's at stake. I wouldn't kid around.

36:06.634 --> 36:07.745
- That easy? 
- That easy.

36:07.898 --> 36:09.485
- Well, why'd you say no before? 
- When?

36:09.602 --> 36:11.773
- When Taylor asked you before? 
- He never asked me before.

36:12.189 --> 36:13.797
- He never asked? 
- Not about a truck,

36:13.935 --> 36:17.941
about a giant ice cream cone a few months back. I said no to that.

36:18.113 --> 36:20.157
Probably why he thought I'd say no to the truck.

36:20.837 --> 36:22.321
- He never asked? 
- Nope.

36:22.511 --> 36:25.974
But you're fine with this, and he could have asked?

36:26.045 --> 36:26.766
It's a public street.

36:26.890 --> 36:28.851
- And you would have said yes? 
- I'd have said yes.

36:28.993 --> 36:31.841
- And I wouldn't have had to go through all this. 
- Probably not.

36:31.973 --> 36:35.061
You know what, I've learned something very valuable here today.

36:36.413 --> 36:38.148
Come on in. Sit down there. Take a load off.

36:38.641 --> 36:40.049
- Very valuable. 
- Good.

36:41.149 --> 36:42.618
I've had a business epiphany.

36:43.059 --> 36:47.514
It's like I'm Bud Fox, saying, "Thanks for the lesson, Mr. Gekko."

36:47.638 --> 36:48.636
This will pass, folks.

36:48.804 --> 36:52.159
The Lorelai you knew is dead. Remember her?

36:52.333 --> 36:54.278
The eager to please, fresh of face?

36:54.539 --> 36:58.031
She thought that success in business meant working hard, applying yourself,

36:58.154 --> 37:01.770
and respecting your coworkers, and she preached that to others - oh, little child.

37:01.994 --> 37:03.833
You should probably get some rest.

37:03.965 --> 37:08.112
It's about scratching backs, my friend, and kissing things - I won't be graphic.

37:08.231 --> 37:11.109
- It is Sunday morning. 
- It's dirty, that's what business is.

37:11.201 --> 37:16.209
It's smoke-filled back rooms with exposed pipes and shady players chewing

37:16.286 --> 37:19.874
on fat cigars and twirling their dirty mustaches.

37:20.125 --> 37:23.688
And when you go into those rooms, you can't be a milquetoast muppet.

37:23.791 --> 37:26.516
You have to have pointy teeth and jaws that snap.

37:26.572 --> 37:29.613
- The meek shall not inherit the earth! 
- Thanks for the perspective.

37:30.294 --> 37:32.736
- Do you have any coffee? 
- I'm not giving you coffee.

37:33.488 --> 37:35.070
I don't have time for coffee.

37:35.435 --> 37:39.009
I gotta go find Taylor and close this deal. You think he's back at the store?

37:39.091 --> 37:41.000
Or having his dirty mustache cleaned.

37:41.118 --> 37:42.748
- You're good with the truck? 
- I'm good with the truck.

37:43.633 --> 37:44.236
Bless you.

37:47.585 --> 37:48.579
I'll be right with you, folks.

37:53.633 --> 37:54.268
So, you're up.

37:55.092 --> 37:57.570
Yeah, I'm up.

37:58.231 --> 38:00.433
It took me a minute or two to figure out where I am, but...

38:00.556 --> 38:01.942
Oh, that's right. You've never been here before.

38:02.567 --> 38:05.732
Yeah, it's not that I remembered. I just kinda looked out the window

38:05.855 --> 38:08.256
- and that's how I could tell. 
- Good, smart.

38:08.988 --> 38:11.036
Little concoction of mine - it'll help with the hangover.

38:15.081 --> 38:18.544
- Guess I had a beer or two too many last night, huh? 
- Yeah, it happens.

38:18.877 --> 38:21.835
- Hope the guys didn't bug you too much. 
- No, they were fine.

38:22.359 --> 38:22.910
Good.

38:25.001 --> 38:26.056
So, you're all dressed there?

38:26.488 --> 38:29.464
Yeah, you know, big day - getting married.

38:30.237 --> 38:30.970
Getting married.

38:33.883 --> 38:36.658
I'm due in the church in about an hour.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.672
- Hey, Dean... 
- And I still gotta pick up my tux.

38:41.887 --> 38:42.694
Yeah, right.

38:48.523 --> 38:49.347
Thanks for everything, Luke.

38:50.779 --> 38:51.564
Yeah, sure.

38:52.849 --> 38:53.566
Good luck.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.421
- So, a total strikeout, huh? 
- Total.

39:04.641 --> 39:06.305
And, you know, at first, I felt bad for them -

39:06.448 --> 39:10.283
so lacking in talent, yet so clueless. Then I just felt bad for their guitars.

39:10.484 --> 39:12.358
Where are all the good young musicians these days?

39:12.485 --> 39:13.965
My ears wanted to fly off my head.

39:14.333 --> 39:17.113
I'm going to the music store to look at things I can't afford. Want to come?

39:17.252 --> 39:18.415
I have to go get ready for this.

39:18.701 --> 39:20.416
- Right. Tell me how it goes. 
- I will.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.931
- Hey, Luke. 
- Hey, Rory.

39:23.114 --> 39:26.648
- Where's your mom? 
- Around somewhere. Why?

39:26.791 --> 39:29.357
I thought I'd find her at Doose's. Did she go back to the inn, or...

39:29.479 --> 39:31.759
She was going back to the inn, then she was picking up a wedding present

39:31.855 --> 39:34.297
for Dean from us, because she hates it when people send gifts later.

39:34.472 --> 39:38.194
And then depending on time, I was either gonna meet her back at home or at the church.

39:38.307 --> 39:40.524
- She have her cell on her? 
- I think it's dead.

39:40.684 --> 39:43.155
- What's going on? 
- Or a pager or something?

39:43.324 --> 39:45.753
- Is something wrong? 
- Oh, no, I just need to check something with her.

39:45.931 --> 39:48.384
- Well, we can stop by after the wedding. 
- Don't go to the wedding.

39:48.523 --> 39:51.118
- What? 
- Don't go to Dean's wedding.

39:51.262 --> 39:55.491
- Why? 
- I just... don't go. Trust me.

39:56.638 --> 39:58.185
It'd just be better this way.

39:59.137 --> 40:00.970
So, you're not going?

40:01.911 --> 40:03.324
- I guess not. 
- Okay, good.

40:04.191 --> 40:07.477
- Good. I'll see you guys later. 
- Yeah, Luke, I'll see you later.

40:11.804 --> 40:14.615
- Lorelai, do you have a minute? 
- Oh, sure, Kirk.

40:14.989 --> 40:16.591
We've had a successful disconnection.

40:16.909 --> 40:18.476
- No more alarm? 
- No more alarm.

40:18.651 --> 40:19.474
Fantastic.

40:19.664 --> 40:22.101
The roofer will be out tomorrow. The repair should take about a day.

40:22.541 --> 40:23.929
I'm not gonna inquire about that right now.

40:24.026 --> 40:26.831
It's all taken care of, and I want to apologize for any inconvenience.

40:26.985 --> 40:28.040
It was no big deal.

40:28.189 --> 40:30.980
I have this strong sense of chivalry when it comes to women living alone.

40:31.093 --> 40:32.127
That's very nice.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.416
My family tree dates back to a 12th-century knight.

40:34.595 --> 40:37.959
As a kid, I thought that meant we were related to Ted Knight.

40:38.277 --> 40:40.485
I wrote him a lot of letters. He never responded.

40:40.784 --> 40:43.223
- That's cute, though. 
- I just want you to feel safe.

40:44.282 --> 40:45.700
You really do, don't you, Kirk?

40:45.900 --> 40:47.999
So, I hope you don't mind my watching out for you.

40:48.572 --> 40:49.280
Not at all.

40:52.654 --> 40:53.243
Thank you.

40:53.877 --> 40:55.208
- I'll see you around. 
- See ya.

40:57.611 --> 41:00.360
I think I found the perfect wedding present for Dean.

41:00.647 --> 41:03.033
It's sweet, not too personal, classy, yet cheap.

41:03.141 --> 41:04.701
- We're not going. 
- What?

41:05.102 --> 41:08.563
Luke was looking for you and ran into me, and he was all nervous and everything,

41:08.624 --> 41:11.143
- and then he finally just said we shouldn't go. 
- What does that mean?

41:11.209 --> 41:12.597
I think it means that we shouldn't go.

41:12.674 --> 41:13.991
- Did he give a reason? 
- Not really.

41:14.236 --> 41:16.444
- I'll go talk to him. 
- No, Mom, he seemed really serious,

41:16.571 --> 41:19.322
and I think that if you saw him you'd feel the same way. He was kind of upset.

41:19.422 --> 41:21.122
- About Dean's wedding? 
- Yeah.

41:21.646 --> 41:22.562
So, we're not going?

41:23.105 --> 41:25.435
- I think it's better that we don't. 
- Okay.

41:25.818 --> 41:27.302
- Mystery, though. 
- Kind of.

41:27.841 --> 41:30.575
Well, you've got your nothing-to-do weekend back.

41:30.735 --> 41:31.834
Yeah, got that back.

41:37.574 --> 41:40.529
Mom, Kirk's following us in a little clowny car.

41:41.159 --> 41:42.285
He's watching out for us.

41:47.392 --> 41:48.501
Ready?

41:49.689 --> 41:52.361
No, it's gotta look like we're actually demolishing the porch.

41:52.783 --> 41:53.909
We're gonna do pretend swings.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.462
Which would have been easier if we had pretend sledgehammers.

41:56.550 --> 41:57.851
Why do they make these so heavy?

41:57.954 --> 42:01.733
Well, even without the swing, this is a good picture of the two of you

42:01.819 --> 42:05.649
about to record an important moment for the two of you.

42:05.864 --> 42:06.411
Michel...

42:06.540 --> 42:10.355
I would love a copy of this for my mantel, such a nice moment.

42:10.468 --> 42:11.896
You have to be in the picture, too, Michel.

42:12.023 --> 42:14.538
Me? I don't know. All right.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.085
That thing have a timer on it?

42:16.203 --> 42:19.218
It's set. I framed the shot. Grab your hammer and smile.

42:20.968 --> 42:22.930
- One more for safety? 
- Okay.

42:28.523 --> 42:29.064
What?

42:32.871 --> 42:34.769
Just sometimes, it hits me.

42:35.408 --> 42:39.505
This place had a long history before us, has a long future after us.

42:40.109 --> 42:43.436
I keep thinking it's apart of our lives, but, really, it's the reverse.

42:44.410 --> 42:45.331
For a little while...

42:46.125 --> 42:48.645
I don't know... it's like we're apart of its life.
