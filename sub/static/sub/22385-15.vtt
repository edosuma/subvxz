WEBVTT

00:01.107 --> 00:02.666
How do you say "organic" in Spanish?

00:02.691 --> 00:03.973
<i>"Organico,"</i> right?

00:03.998 --> 00:06.120
And cloth is <i> "paño,"</i> yeah.

00:06.145 --> 00:07.511
I don't see 'em.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.270
They have organic nighttime diapers,

00:09.295 --> 00:10.905
they have cloth nighttime diapers.

00:10.930 --> 00:13.600
I do not see organic cloth
nighttime diapers.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.516
No, I'm not saying
I want to move back to America,

00:15.541 --> 00:18.192
I'm just saying that in America,
diapers come to you.

00:18.312 --> 00:19.688
Hold on, there's a guy right here.

00:19.713 --> 00:21.612
I'm gonna ask him. Call you back.

00:21.714 --> 00:23.781
Hi,<i> hola.</i> Um...

00:23.851 --> 00:25.830
I'm looking for <i> organico...</i>

00:25.906 --> 00:29.607
<i>paño... Durante la noche pañales?</i>

00:29.662 --> 00:31.369
Does that... Am I saying...

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.261 --> 00:42.927
There's a shredder at the office.

00:42.952 --> 00:44.418
You know that, right?

00:44.443 --> 00:46.650
I prefer closing the case
with a burn bag.

00:47.010 --> 00:48.443
No leftover pieces,

00:48.468 --> 00:50.118
nothing to glue back together.

00:50.146 --> 00:51.411
So paranoid.

00:51.436 --> 00:53.165
Well, paranoia kept me alive

00:53.190 --> 00:54.388
in my undercover days.

00:54.413 --> 00:55.701
What'd you say your cover was?

00:55.726 --> 00:57.936
Senior bibliographical specialist

00:57.961 --> 01:02.074
for digital resources
and electronic catalogs

01:02.099 --> 01:04.157
- for archival assets...
- Oh, my God,

01:04.182 --> 01:05.815
stop, that is so boring.

01:05.917 --> 01:07.917
Yeah, well, that was the idea.

01:09.358 --> 01:11.792
- Do you ever miss it?
- Hmm?

01:11.896 --> 01:13.195
Being undercover?

01:13.244 --> 01:14.610
Traveling the world?

01:14.645 --> 01:16.879
Yeah, I do.

01:17.108 --> 01:18.863
But my family's my life now.

01:18.955 --> 01:20.922
The field works for people
who don't have anyone.

01:24.355 --> 01:27.023
Keaton. When?

01:27.451 --> 01:28.882
Okay, we'll take it from here.

01:28.907 --> 01:30.899
- What's going on?
- A CIA transport plane

01:30.924 --> 01:32.810
just crashed in the East River.

01:32.835 --> 01:35.569
Come on, let's go find out more.

01:41.094 --> 01:44.106
Uh... No. Definitely not.

01:45.009 --> 01:47.168
Seriously? I grew up in Europe.

01:47.328 --> 01:50.272
Right. So do you see
the Eiffel Tower out there?

01:51.533 --> 01:53.442
He's a stickler for the rules.

01:53.949 --> 01:55.582
Thanks for dinner.

01:55.650 --> 01:57.884
I've been eating a lot
of takeout recently

01:57.953 --> 01:59.752
and it was nice to have
something homemade.

01:59.821 --> 02:01.087
Well, we're glad you could come.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.056
Um...

02:03.124 --> 02:05.892
We didn't just
invite you here for dinner.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.207
There's something that you need to see.

02:08.646 --> 02:11.460
A friend of mine
sent me some information.

02:11.572 --> 02:12.705
Someone that I trust.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.968
I'm calling because I've uncovered

02:14.993 --> 02:16.402
some very interesting information

02:16.471 --> 02:17.923
<i>about Avery's death.</i>

02:18.283 --> 02:20.234
This is starting to feel less nice.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.941
We wanted to show you in person

02:22.010 --> 02:23.781
and go over the information together

02:23.806 --> 02:26.707
so that if you have
any questions or doubts,

02:26.732 --> 02:28.865
we could all talk about them together.

02:29.063 --> 02:32.160
We have evidence that
your dad might not have been

02:32.185 --> 02:33.632
exactly who you thought he was.

02:33.657 --> 02:35.456
- What do you mean?
- Well, we know that you

02:35.522 --> 02:36.788
grew up around the Crawfords

02:36.844 --> 02:38.944
and that your families
were really close.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.825
I don't think we realized how close.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.370
Can you just tell me
what you're gonna tell me?

02:42.999 --> 02:44.526
We think your dad killed someone

02:44.551 --> 02:46.884
and Hank Crawford covered it up.

02:47.249 --> 02:49.340
- In this folder...
- No.

02:49.481 --> 02:52.482
No, just because my dad was
Crawford's VP of operations

02:52.548 --> 02:54.566
- doesn't make him a killer.
- I know this is difficult

02:54.591 --> 02:56.867
and I know that you probably
don't want to hear it from me,

02:56.898 --> 02:58.985
but Avery, you really
should open the folder.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.543
Screw the folder.

03:00.642 --> 03:01.979
Whatever you guys think you know,

03:02.004 --> 03:04.004
you're wrong.

03:05.655 --> 03:08.689
Avery. Avery, wait!

03:13.274 --> 03:16.697
I'll be honest, I don't
know what I'm looking at.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.997
It's everything on Hank Crawford.

03:19.022 --> 03:20.355
No, I know what it is.

03:20.380 --> 03:22.396
I'm saying it's garbage,
it's a garbage file.

03:22.421 --> 03:23.586
It's enough to investigate him.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.027
Yeah, if only we had some sort of

03:25.052 --> 03:26.718
federal bureau to do just that.

03:26.743 --> 03:28.367
You're the U.S. attorney.

03:28.392 --> 03:31.016
And I'd like to stay a U.S. attorney.

03:31.041 --> 03:33.021
I can't go after someone like Crawford

03:33.060 --> 03:34.993
with circumstantial tattoo theories.

03:35.018 --> 03:39.282
As far as my office goes,
Hank Crawford is... is what?

03:39.555 --> 03:41.960
A slightly crooked businessman?

03:41.985 --> 03:43.718
That's a big "who cares" right now.

03:43.743 --> 03:46.935
You're not seeing
the connections, okay?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.700
This guy is an international
criminal operator.

03:48.749 --> 03:50.191
He funded Sandstorm.

03:50.239 --> 03:52.106
He's actively planning
something right now.

03:52.131 --> 03:54.852
The fact that we don't know what
it is should terrify us all.

03:54.877 --> 03:57.305
That doesn't matter.
Crawford can out-leverage

03:57.330 --> 03:59.849
and outspend the entire
United States of America.

03:59.876 --> 04:03.121
He can shift the news cycle
in any direction he wants.

04:03.288 --> 04:06.920
And we... when I say we,
I mean specifically I...

04:06.973 --> 04:10.508
Don't have the privilege of
beyond a reasonable doubt.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.222
I need zero doubt. I need a cooperator

04:13.247 --> 04:14.916
from inside his organization

04:14.941 --> 04:17.041
or a confession or video proof.

04:18.244 --> 04:21.012
Until we have that, we've got nothing.

04:21.081 --> 04:22.740
Have a nice night.

04:32.344 --> 04:34.625
All right, all right, all right.

04:35.038 --> 04:36.662
Go over it again.

04:38.057 --> 04:39.792
We're wasting time, okay?

04:39.817 --> 04:40.857
Another 24 hours, and Blake...

04:42.786 --> 04:44.853
Jean-Paul Bruyers is
gonna be here any second,

04:44.922 --> 04:46.723
and I want crystal
clarity on the details

04:46.748 --> 04:49.961
of how you lost our children
before he arrives.

04:49.986 --> 04:52.820
Go over it again.

04:57.359 --> 04:58.809
I told you.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.540
There was nothing I could do.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.508
And now I'm here wasting time with you

05:07.533 --> 05:08.925
when I could be out there
looking for her.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.570
The kidnappers haven't
contacted us yet.

05:10.595 --> 05:13.190
I can't have you raging all over Rio,

05:13.250 --> 05:15.868
making a bigger mess while
I try to get Blake back.

05:15.902 --> 05:17.901
So, that's it? I'm just
supposed to sit around

05:17.926 --> 05:19.855
while you and Jean-Paul
make phone calls?

05:20.743 --> 05:22.856
What am I doing here if I can't help?

05:23.296 --> 05:25.293
Do you think I'm a dangerous man, Tom?

05:27.252 --> 05:29.778
Well, Jean-Paul
is a very dangerous man.

05:29.865 --> 05:32.784
You are here for my protection,

05:33.324 --> 05:35.303
so beyond that,
you keep your mouth shut.

05:36.338 --> 05:38.443
You stay out of my way.

05:46.622 --> 05:48.021
- Jake.
- Hey.

05:48.046 --> 05:50.042
- Thanks for coming.
- Anytime. This is Zapata.

05:50.094 --> 05:52.002
Zapata, New York station
chief Rob Donnelly.

05:52.027 --> 05:53.762
- I heard great things.
- Likewise.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.868
What happened here?

05:54.893 --> 05:57.487
Air traffic control guy
lost a mayday call

05:57.512 --> 05:59.272
just as a pilot was attempting

05:59.301 --> 06:01.364
to make an emergency water landing.

06:01.389 --> 06:03.597
The plane's in the drink.
Any survivors?

06:03.686 --> 06:05.819
I wouldn't hold your breath, or theirs.

06:05.994 --> 06:07.260
Flight manifest?

06:07.503 --> 06:08.857
They're working on it.

06:08.882 --> 06:10.949
- Black box?
- Divers just brought it up.

06:11.047 --> 06:12.680
- I'll get it for you.
- Okay.

06:21.910 --> 06:23.042
Are you seeing that?

06:23.093 --> 06:24.443
Valkyrie International Cargo.

06:24.499 --> 06:26.236
The musical notes on Jane's lower back

06:26.261 --> 06:28.327
are from Wagner's
"Flight of the Valkyries."

06:28.352 --> 06:30.152
This could be what
Patterson's been looking for.

06:30.409 --> 06:31.727
We need to get that black box.

06:31.752 --> 06:33.852
- Whoa, whoa. Pump your brakes, Chief.
- Why?

06:33.877 --> 06:36.292
Because that's a CIA plane
and Jane's tattoos

06:36.317 --> 06:37.972
don't tend to uncover good news.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.426
- Did you know about this?
- No, but this is clearly

06:40.451 --> 06:41.923
an op we haven't been read in on,

06:41.948 --> 06:43.446
so let's just keep this internal

06:43.471 --> 06:45.405
until we have more
answers than questions.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.441
- You see this yet?
- This gonna be a problem?

06:47.466 --> 06:49.419
No. Not if they don't find out.

06:49.652 --> 06:52.287
We're already keeping
Project Dragonfly from them.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.880
- And?
- And I'm at capacity

06:53.948 --> 06:56.219
for keeping CIA secrets
from this task force.

06:56.286 --> 06:58.723
Besides, a plane crashed.

06:58.843 --> 07:01.176
It's gonna be hard to keep that quiet.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.122
All right, do what you gotta do.

07:15.822 --> 07:17.889
- Kurt.
- Hmm?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.504
I think I just heard something.

07:33.437 --> 07:34.569
Don't move.

07:34.594 --> 07:36.320
Cade...

07:36.496 --> 07:38.014
I'm not gonna kill you.

07:38.944 --> 07:40.532
I need your help.

07:47.956 --> 07:51.956
synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com

07:58.567 --> 07:59.967
Call your boyfriend in.

08:00.182 --> 08:01.534
He's my husband now.

08:01.594 --> 08:03.571
How nice for you. Call him!

08:03.862 --> 08:07.175
Kurt. Cade's here, he has a gun.

08:07.476 --> 08:08.795
I can see that.

08:08.858 --> 08:13.027
Easy. I told your wife
I'm not gonna shoot anyone.

08:13.189 --> 08:15.455
- So put it down.
- I will.

08:15.518 --> 08:17.518
Soon as I'm sure
you're not gonna shoot me.

08:17.586 --> 08:19.129
What do you want?

08:19.229 --> 08:20.688
I want what I was promised.

08:20.757 --> 08:23.991
I want a guarantee that I can
walk away free after this.

08:24.328 --> 08:26.350
I didn't think you were gonna
come through on your promise.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.275
- Where will you go?
- Anywhere but here.

08:28.688 --> 08:31.171
- I want my family back.
- Your family?

08:31.236 --> 08:33.477
My husband. My son.

08:33.503 --> 08:35.077
I'm not supposed to be in a blacksite.

08:35.102 --> 08:36.581
I'm supposed to be with them!

08:36.606 --> 08:38.631
- We had a deal!
- You got your money,

08:38.657 --> 08:39.932
we let you walk away.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.890
The CIA burned that deal to the ground.

08:42.017 --> 08:43.381
I put my son to bed.

08:43.446 --> 08:45.646
I went out for diapers
and they took me.

08:45.715 --> 08:47.360
That was the last time I saw them.

08:47.587 --> 08:50.251
My family thinks I abandoned them.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.212
We can help you get your family back.

08:52.259 --> 08:54.688
Just put the gun down.

08:55.325 --> 08:57.758
I want a new deal. In writing.

08:57.827 --> 09:00.094
You just broke out of a blacksite.

09:00.656 --> 09:02.344
It's gonna be very hard to help you.

09:02.396 --> 09:03.631
I didn't break out.

09:04.069 --> 09:05.975
I was on a CIA plane that crashed

09:06.362 --> 09:07.868
and I'm not the only one who survived.

09:08.236 --> 09:09.402
What do you mean?

09:09.437 --> 09:10.636
It was a black flight.

09:10.661 --> 09:11.778
There were three other prisoners

09:11.802 --> 09:12.935
on the plane with me.

09:13.003 --> 09:14.688
Now they're all loose in New York.

09:14.802 --> 09:16.572
That is not enough for a new deal,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.107
unless you help us find them.

09:19.575 --> 09:21.308
I can do more than that.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.874
The plane was crashed on purpose

09:24.166 --> 09:27.334
and I'm the only one who
knows what's really going on.

09:35.536 --> 09:37.449
There's no way anyone walked away

09:37.496 --> 09:39.783
from that crash unscathed,
let alone multiple people.

09:39.808 --> 09:42.149
Then how do you explain Cade
showing up at our apartment?

09:42.174 --> 09:43.981
I don't know. Maybe he took the subway.

09:44.048 --> 09:45.113
Hey, maybe he burned through

09:45.138 --> 09:46.186
the half-million you already gave him

09:46.210 --> 09:47.600
and stopped by for a top-up.

09:47.625 --> 09:48.695
Think he's playing us?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.434
Yeah, of course he is. He's Sandstorm.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.988
- Former Sandstorm.
- Look, he wants full immunity,

09:53.220 --> 09:54.653
Millions in reparations,

09:54.678 --> 09:56.397
witness protection for his family,

09:56.422 --> 09:57.822
and he's not gonna say another word

09:57.847 --> 09:59.453
until he gets it? Come on.

09:59.478 --> 10:01.551
- He's got a big bunch of nothing.
- I trust him.

10:01.576 --> 10:02.924
Yeah, that surprises me zero.

10:02.949 --> 10:05.019
He took a huge risk coming to us.

10:05.087 --> 10:07.320
Jane's right. Until
we can prove otherwise,

10:07.345 --> 10:09.278
we have to operate as if
he's telling the truth.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.212
- You got a flight manifest?
- I'm working on it.

10:11.237 --> 10:12.612
Cade was being held with some

10:12.637 --> 10:13.955
of the world's worst criminals.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.167
If any of them escaped,
the whole country

10:16.192 --> 10:17.428
would go to threat level red

10:17.453 --> 10:18.792
right until they're caught or killed.
All right,

10:18.816 --> 10:20.541
so let's give him a deal,
find out what he knows.

10:20.566 --> 10:21.783
I'm not handing out a deal

10:21.808 --> 10:23.238
to a Sandstorm terrorist.

10:23.263 --> 10:25.456
Cade helped us fight Sandstorm.

10:26.089 --> 10:27.630
You've given deals to worse people.

10:27.655 --> 10:29.629
Listen to you. Look, we don't even know

10:29.654 --> 10:31.359
for sure if he was on that plane.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.733
What is it?

10:35.961 --> 10:37.861
It's a flight manifest.

10:38.851 --> 10:40.563
Cade was for sure on that plane,

10:40.588 --> 10:41.910
and according to the manifest,

10:41.935 --> 10:44.369
so were these three
terrifying individuals.

10:44.470 --> 10:45.969
They're all forever prisoners.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.215
Is that what it sounds like?

10:47.240 --> 10:48.375
Continued detention

10:48.400 --> 10:49.659
pursuant to the authorization

10:49.684 --> 10:51.519
for use of military force
as informed by

10:51.544 --> 10:53.201
the principles of the laws of war.

10:53.226 --> 10:54.623
You can see why they
gave it the nickname.

10:54.648 --> 10:56.648
Their wrap sheets are a gong show.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.162
Terrorism, war crimes,

10:58.231 --> 10:59.661
crimes against humanity,

10:59.686 --> 11:01.505
inciting and financing a genocide.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.868
This guy, though? Never mind, it's bad.

11:03.893 --> 11:04.936
It's all very bad.

11:04.961 --> 11:06.170
And it gets worse from there.

11:06.239 --> 11:08.005
The CIA plane was a tattoo.

11:08.074 --> 11:09.673
And not just any tattoo,

11:09.742 --> 11:12.276
my nemesis tattoo,
"Ride of the Valkyries."

11:12.417 --> 11:15.362
I've been sifting through dead-end
Valkyrie hits since day one.

11:15.387 --> 11:16.747
Now we know why.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.602
Valkyrie International Cargo
is a CIA front.

11:20.642 --> 11:23.154
No paper trails, no record
of these planes being active,

11:23.222 --> 11:25.367
so until this one fell from the sky,

11:25.673 --> 11:27.706
there was no way to find
the Crawford connection.

11:27.731 --> 11:28.968
There's a Crawford connection?

11:28.993 --> 11:31.043
This plane is part of
a fleet of DASH-19 jets

11:31.068 --> 11:34.415
manufactured exclusively
by a subsidiary of HCI Global.

11:34.464 --> 11:36.935
So Crawford built the planes
and sold them to the CIA.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.252
To what end?

11:38.452 --> 11:39.887
Commerce, probably.

11:39.912 --> 11:41.200
We gotta buy our planes from someone.

11:41.225 --> 11:42.354
You knew about this?

11:42.379 --> 11:44.019
I'm getting real tired
of being asked that.

11:44.044 --> 11:45.140
I'm getting tired of asking.

11:45.165 --> 11:46.631
So why keep it off the books?

11:46.863 --> 11:49.097
Well, that's how we operate, Kurt.

11:49.218 --> 11:51.085
That's our whole thing...
We hide stuff.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.834
Well, lucky for us, I find stuff.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.352
I ran a flight simulator

11:55.377 --> 11:57.649
to analyze the data from the black box.

11:57.887 --> 12:00.659
Most of the readings add up,

12:00.759 --> 12:02.397
but there are some inconsistencies

12:02.465 --> 12:04.332
if you know what
to look for, which I do.

12:04.401 --> 12:06.740
- What'd you find?
- The black box was hacked.

12:06.864 --> 12:08.519
The telemetry was programmed

12:08.544 --> 12:11.269
to follow a script,
but the script couldn't account

12:11.294 --> 12:12.930
for every real-world variable.

12:13.016 --> 12:14.590
- For example, the thrust...
- You know what?

12:14.662 --> 12:16.919
- Just skip ahead.
- Very good.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.811
Cade's telling the truth.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.537
That plane was crashed on purpose.

12:21.702 --> 12:23.201
So we need to know who in the CIA

12:23.226 --> 12:24.746
has access to those prisoners.

12:24.771 --> 12:26.020
This is an inside job.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.812
Or someone making it look like one.

12:27.837 --> 12:29.185
She just said the box was hacked,

12:29.210 --> 12:30.479
the plane could have been, too.

12:30.504 --> 12:32.144
Look, either way, whoever it was

12:32.199 --> 12:34.432
is powerful enough to have
access to CIA planes

12:34.461 --> 12:35.894
and jailbreak those terrorists.

12:35.957 --> 12:37.173
We need to find them.

12:37.198 --> 12:38.690
Let's move.

12:49.676 --> 12:50.975
Ten million.

12:52.749 --> 12:54.148
They have really done their homework.

12:54.227 --> 12:55.760
What makes you say that?

12:55.889 --> 12:59.018
I've got a 200 million kidnap
and ransom policy for Blake,

12:59.532 --> 13:01.120
with a 20 million deductible,

13:01.388 --> 13:02.654
and they're calling this a discount.

13:02.722 --> 13:05.195
10 million is not a discount.

13:05.220 --> 13:06.816
Jean-Paul, if money is a concern...

13:06.841 --> 13:08.103
No, money is not a concern.

13:08.128 --> 13:09.371
I am willing to pay your share.

13:09.396 --> 13:11.042
No, don't be foolish.
I won't allow you to pay.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.654
And I won't allow you to let your pride

13:12.679 --> 13:14.479
get in the way of
getting our children back.

13:14.504 --> 13:16.787
Look, if we pay these animals,

13:16.830 --> 13:19.764
they will just take my son
again or someone else will.

13:19.789 --> 13:22.112
It will be open season on our families.

13:22.156 --> 13:23.391
And have you got a better idea?

13:23.416 --> 13:25.250
Yes. Yes.

13:25.275 --> 13:28.043
I'll have this man skinned
and hanged from a bridge

13:28.068 --> 13:31.487
as a warning to others
that it never happens again.

13:38.591 --> 13:40.024
Very good.

13:40.351 --> 13:42.442
- Prepare the team.
- For what?

13:42.502 --> 13:44.796
Well, I have a lot of
contacts here in Rio

13:44.864 --> 13:47.629
and the children are likely
being held in a nightclub

13:47.694 --> 13:49.140
in Favela de Rocinha.

13:49.198 --> 13:50.440
Take the armored car.

13:50.465 --> 13:52.703
- That's a mistake.
- Tom...

13:52.772 --> 13:55.314
Rocinha is controlled
by Amigos dos Amigos.

13:55.374 --> 13:56.827
Your men walk in the wrong door,

13:56.852 --> 13:58.236
they're not walking out again.

13:58.261 --> 13:59.433
Who is this?

13:59.458 --> 14:02.208
No one. He's my daughter's bodyguard.

14:02.252 --> 14:04.352
Oh, so this is all your fault.

14:05.734 --> 14:07.848
We still don't know who
has Blake and Christophe,

14:07.873 --> 14:09.166
we don't know how many there are

14:09.191 --> 14:10.693
or what they're willing
to do to get their money.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.083
You don't wanna pay, that's fine,

14:12.108 --> 14:14.982
there are other ways to get them back,

14:15.142 --> 14:16.811
but if you're gonna storm the gates,

14:16.836 --> 14:19.045
do it right, 'cause if you do it wrong,

14:19.128 --> 14:21.261
you start a gang war and the kidnappers

14:21.286 --> 14:22.986
will cut their losses
and kill your kids.

14:23.019 --> 14:24.517
My men are ex-Mossad.

14:24.547 --> 14:26.856
They are the best of
the best. I trust them.

14:27.289 --> 14:28.856
Do you?

14:31.328 --> 14:32.627
Jean-Paul is right.

14:33.077 --> 14:34.462
We need to send a message.

14:35.216 --> 14:37.565
And right now, we got
the element of surprise.

14:37.963 --> 14:40.068
All right. It's settled, then.

14:40.136 --> 14:41.369
Draw up a plan.

14:41.438 --> 14:43.605
I want to be on the road
within the hour.

14:55.558 --> 14:57.393
Why didn't you tell me
the CIA's using planes

14:57.418 --> 14:58.684
built by Hank Crawford?

14:58.803 --> 15:00.317
Because I didn't know.

15:00.437 --> 15:01.764
You expect me to believe that?

15:01.789 --> 15:03.789
I'm your boss. I expect you to drop it.

15:04.117 --> 15:05.667
Did you know about Cade?

15:05.947 --> 15:07.589
Look, CIA intel

15:07.614 --> 15:09.313
is highly compartmentalized.

15:09.347 --> 15:11.095
You don't like being kept in the dark,

15:11.120 --> 15:12.505
you're working for the wrong company.

15:12.530 --> 15:14.604
There's always gonna be
stuff we don't know.

15:14.644 --> 15:15.977
They need us not to know

15:16.002 --> 15:17.666
and you need to get okay with that.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.883
Why wouldn't you give Cade his deal?

15:23.012 --> 15:25.317
Because I can't deliver on it yet.

15:25.422 --> 15:27.377
Look, I made a few calls, all right?

15:27.402 --> 15:30.136
Cade's family is placed in CIA WITSEC.

15:30.459 --> 15:32.626
His husband's not
especially eager to see him

15:32.651 --> 15:33.684
now that he knows the truth.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.709
- And the truth is?
- Cade got married

15:35.734 --> 15:38.169
and adopted a baby under a false name.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.950
I wouldn't be thrilled to find
out my spouse was a terrorist.

15:41.004 --> 15:42.198
I'm heading to the office,

15:42.223 --> 15:43.658
see if I can expedite the red tape

15:43.683 --> 15:44.809
and get them onto a plane.

15:44.834 --> 15:47.501
Cool. I know a secret
airline you can use.

15:52.622 --> 15:54.054
Where's my deal?

15:54.108 --> 15:55.522
We're working on it.

15:55.591 --> 15:57.081
You're sure taking your sweet time.

15:57.106 --> 15:58.217
It's almost like you don't want to know

15:58.241 --> 15:59.757
- what's gonna happen.
- It's not us.

15:59.782 --> 16:01.220
- What does that mean?
- Technically,

16:01.244 --> 16:02.476
you're a prisoner of the CIA

16:02.501 --> 16:04.035
and the CIA is reluctant to deal.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.626
But if you do give us
something in good faith,

16:06.765 --> 16:09.111
- that could go a long way.
- Nice try.

16:09.747 --> 16:11.479
Isn't that why you came to us?

16:11.548 --> 16:13.117
Because we made good
the first time around,

16:13.142 --> 16:14.473
we let you walk away.

16:14.498 --> 16:16.940
Yeah, right into a CIA blacksite.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.453
Why should I trust you this time?

16:18.522 --> 16:20.126
Because we have a history,

16:20.216 --> 16:21.616
even if I can't remember it.

16:22.126 --> 16:24.526
Look, I got the chance
to change my life.

16:24.825 --> 16:26.278
I want the same for you, too.

16:26.323 --> 16:28.156
'Til someone comes along
and rips it away again.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.005
No, not this time.

16:30.454 --> 16:32.578
Look, I promise you,
I will push for you

16:32.603 --> 16:35.437
as hard as I can, but I need
something to push with.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.701
Prisoner got out of his cuffs,

16:40.760 --> 16:42.917
killed the escort officers
and freed everyone else,

16:42.984 --> 16:44.744
grabbed the parachutes
under our seats and jumped.

16:44.769 --> 16:46.697
- So who crashed the plane?
- Beats me.

16:46.722 --> 16:48.547
Soon as my cuffs were off,
I was out the door.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.067
Landed in the woods, ditched my chute

16:50.136 --> 16:52.601
and made my way to what I
hoped was still your apartment.

16:52.694 --> 16:54.371
You just confessed
to multiple felonies.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.417
So add it to my immunity deal.
I'm telling you the truth

16:57.442 --> 16:59.643
so no one can throw me in
the hole on some technicality.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.009
If the CIA was reluctant
to give you a deal before,

17:02.034 --> 17:03.600
there's no way they're gonna do it now.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.058
Yes, they will.

17:05.126 --> 17:06.858
'Cause this wasn't just a prison break.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.674
Those prisoners aren't just on the run.

17:08.699 --> 17:10.232
What are you talking about?

17:10.295 --> 17:14.337
Someone masterminded this
because they had a plan.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.374
An attack in New York.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.701
What's the attack?

17:18.726 --> 17:20.025
It's a building raid.

17:20.050 --> 17:22.282
Plenty of firepower
and plenty of spectacle

17:22.372 --> 17:24.606
and it's happening tonight.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.835
Now, where's my son?

17:29.289 --> 17:30.752
Where are we on the missing prisoners?

17:30.777 --> 17:31.897
I'm combing through social media

17:31.922 --> 17:33.595
looking for anyone
who witnessed the jump,

17:33.669 --> 17:35.564
looking for anything
that'll give us a lead.

17:35.589 --> 17:36.803
- And?
- Still combing.

17:36.828 --> 17:38.662
Okay, what about whoever
masterminded the crash?

17:38.687 --> 17:40.754
How many CIA operatives have
access to the blacksites?

17:40.959 --> 17:42.853
Hard to say.
The whole list is redacted.

17:43.090 --> 17:44.144
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

17:44.169 --> 17:45.619
Zapata, you can't get
a clean copy of this thing?

17:45.643 --> 17:46.812
I'm trying, believe me.

17:46.837 --> 17:47.877
It's a bureaucratic nightmare.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.300
Well, it's gonna be
a very real nightmare

17:49.325 --> 17:50.343
if we don't stop this attack.

17:50.368 --> 17:51.767
Cade is sitting in interrogation.

17:51.792 --> 17:53.279
He could know where the prisoners are.

17:53.304 --> 17:54.470
He could know where the attack is.

17:54.495 --> 17:55.856
All he wants to see is his kid.

17:55.881 --> 17:56.946
Can someone tell me again

17:56.971 --> 17:58.190
why we're not bringing his kid in?

17:58.215 --> 18:00.807
Hang on. We're bringing in his kid.

18:00.993 --> 18:03.041
- Since when?
- Since Keaton just texted.

18:03.066 --> 18:04.711
Okay, do whatever it takes.
I want Cade's deal

18:04.736 --> 18:06.480
ready to sign as soon as they land.

18:15.032 --> 18:17.150
They want you, sir.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.325
Jean-Paul's men
are cold-blooded killers

18:20.404 --> 18:22.971
whose primary objective
is to get his son back.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.786
If something goes wrong
and they have to choose

18:24.811 --> 18:26.110
between Blake and Junior,

18:26.621 --> 18:27.977
they won't choose her.

18:28.254 --> 18:31.313
All right. You said your piece.

18:31.562 --> 18:33.315
I'm not debating this with you.

18:33.384 --> 18:35.098
The kidnappers have done
their homework.

18:35.123 --> 18:36.263
They know who they took, so they know

18:36.287 --> 18:38.354
who'll be coming for them
and they will be ready.

18:38.422 --> 18:41.555
Jean-Paul's plan is a suicide mission.

18:41.868 --> 18:44.693
This is the only way to prevent
them from being taken again.

18:44.929 --> 18:46.762
How, by having them
killed the first time?

18:46.831 --> 18:48.270
I made a deal.

18:48.550 --> 18:51.033
I gave the man my word,
I can't go back on it.

18:51.605 --> 18:52.846
Of course you can.

18:52.871 --> 18:55.037
Jean-Paul, he's not
gonna pay the ransom.

18:56.056 --> 18:58.707
- I have no other choice.
- Yes, you do.

18:59.203 --> 19:02.424
Send someone from our side with them.

19:02.993 --> 19:04.568
Someone who will choose Blake.

19:04.593 --> 19:06.523
You just said this was
a suicide mission.

19:06.614 --> 19:08.581
So I'll get her back
or I'll die trying.

19:17.611 --> 19:19.339
Okay, that's the last signature.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.009
Deal's done. I'll bring him in.

19:23.225 --> 19:24.924
Wait.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.866
Can you...?

19:28.382 --> 19:30.138
I'm sorry, I can't.

19:31.532 --> 19:33.178
Here.

19:37.231 --> 19:38.431
Thank you.

19:38.513 --> 19:39.679
Yeah.

19:43.363 --> 19:44.529
Hi.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.984
Hi, little man.

19:47.147 --> 19:49.314
Oh, you got so big. Hi.

19:51.171 --> 19:52.704
Where's Joe?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.391
He didn't want to come in.

19:54.608 --> 19:57.036
What? We made him come here,

19:57.061 --> 19:58.909
we can't force him into the room.

20:00.047 --> 20:01.713
It's okay, baby.

20:01.782 --> 20:03.682
It's okay, it's Daddy, it's okay.

20:03.850 --> 20:04.850
No.

20:04.890 --> 20:06.890
I never left you, okay?

20:07.154 --> 20:09.788
I love you, I love you with my
whole heart, I never left you.

20:15.295 --> 20:17.395
Let him go, let him go.

20:22.935 --> 20:25.863
Hey. They said you were in here.

20:25.975 --> 20:30.041
I just came to apologize
for storming out like I did.

20:30.669 --> 20:33.678
The stuff you guys were saying
about my dad was hard to hear.

20:34.362 --> 20:35.762
I understand.

20:35.916 --> 20:37.075
Do you?

20:37.129 --> 20:39.848
My father wasn't who
I thought he was either.

20:39.981 --> 20:42.519
Or maybe he was exactly
who I thought he was.

20:42.587 --> 20:44.489
Either way, I had to know the truth.

20:44.985 --> 20:46.117
That's why I'm here.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.499
What's in that folder?

20:47.568 --> 20:49.201
It's a police report.

20:49.262 --> 20:51.662
Your father was arrested
for murder in Prague.

20:51.826 --> 20:54.023
His name was taken off the record,

20:54.048 --> 20:55.407
it was officially filed.

20:55.476 --> 20:57.042
But we have the original.

20:57.397 --> 20:58.496
I want to see it.

20:58.565 --> 21:00.031
I'll have it brought down.

21:00.322 --> 21:02.567
We could use your help in figuring out

21:02.636 --> 21:04.369
how all these pieces fit together.

21:04.437 --> 21:09.173
Your father, Crawford, Roman,
they're all connected.

21:10.342 --> 21:11.948
I'll do my best.

21:12.628 --> 21:15.179
All we have is the truth.

21:15.533 --> 21:17.166
Even when it hurts.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.822
I'm sorry, I know that's
not what you wanted.

21:25.032 --> 21:26.958
No.

21:27.434 --> 21:29.861
We still need to know where
the attack is happening.

21:30.416 --> 21:31.715
Who's planning it?

21:31.848 --> 21:34.132
Forget it, I don't know
what I was expecting.

21:34.548 --> 21:35.833
Cade, please.

21:36.243 --> 21:38.002
There's still time to change this.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.928
We can try again. We held up
our end of the deal.

21:40.953 --> 21:42.259
Now, you need to tell us
everything you know

21:42.283 --> 21:43.379
or it all goes away.

21:43.404 --> 21:44.469
It's already gone away.

21:44.494 --> 21:45.993
My husband doesn't want to see me,

21:46.018 --> 21:47.220
my son doesn't even know me.

21:47.245 --> 21:49.261
Think of everyone who will lose a child

21:49.286 --> 21:51.453
or a parent if this attack happens.

21:51.874 --> 21:53.488
You came to us for help.

21:53.943 --> 21:55.475
Let us help.

21:58.247 --> 22:00.061
A woman visited me in the blacksite.

22:00.130 --> 22:01.215
Who was she?

22:01.240 --> 22:02.462
Was she on the plane with you?

22:02.487 --> 22:03.798
No.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.835
Just me and the other prisoners
and the escort officers.

22:07.094 --> 22:08.583
All I had to do
was jump with the others,

22:08.608 --> 22:10.241
meet everyone at the flophouse.

22:10.407 --> 22:12.455
That's a pretty big ask
with very few details.

22:12.547 --> 22:13.947
Why would you agree to it?

22:13.982 --> 22:16.356
I was being held
without charge or trial.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.658
She was offering me freedom.

22:18.985 --> 22:21.127
More money than I could ever use.

22:21.513 --> 22:23.563
I was never gonna go along
with the bigger attack.

22:23.588 --> 22:25.882
I didn't even know which
building was being raided.

22:25.907 --> 22:27.296
You were bluffing?

22:27.682 --> 22:29.302
You don't know anything? No.

22:30.609 --> 22:32.448
I know what the woman looks like

22:32.473 --> 22:35.574
and I know where she told us
to meet her before the attack.

22:37.377 --> 22:39.086
Bravo team just got to the flophouse.

22:39.111 --> 22:41.255
They're taking pictures,
but no sign of the prisoners.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.564
We just didn't get there in time.

22:42.589 --> 22:45.396
See, MREs, prisoner jumpsuits.

22:45.421 --> 22:46.590
They've already been there and left.

22:46.614 --> 22:48.407
This attack's in motion.
We're running out of time.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.100
There are four parachutes.

22:50.150 --> 22:51.806
Cade said he ditched his in the woods.

22:51.831 --> 22:53.581
And he also said there
were only four prisoners

22:53.606 --> 22:54.953
on that plane, including himself.

22:55.008 --> 22:56.832
Which the manifest confirms.

22:56.898 --> 22:59.226
So who's the fifth parachute?
Who else jumped?

22:59.251 --> 23:00.705
Cade said that the woman
from the blacksite

23:00.730 --> 23:02.861
- wasn't on the plane.
- Yeah, but what if she was?

23:02.930 --> 23:04.297
What if he just couldn't see her?

23:04.322 --> 23:05.659
There's only one place on that plane

23:05.683 --> 23:07.104
that you can be without being seen.

23:07.129 --> 23:09.209
- Cockpit.
- How many high-level CIA officers

23:09.234 --> 23:10.401
have pilot credentials?

23:10.426 --> 23:11.549
It can't be that many.

23:11.574 --> 23:12.738
She could have hacked the black box,

23:12.762 --> 23:14.060
sent the plane on a collision course

23:14.085 --> 23:15.398
with the water and jumped out
at the last minute.

23:15.422 --> 23:17.275
Yeah, but why take the risk?
Why be on that plane

23:17.300 --> 23:18.900
if you don't have to be?
Because it's the only way

23:18.949 --> 23:20.538
- to make the mayday call.
- Yeah, to ensure

23:20.563 --> 23:22.329
everything goes exactly as planned.

23:22.365 --> 23:23.768
Maintain anonymity in case

23:23.793 --> 23:25.250
one of the prisoners
has a change of heart.

23:25.275 --> 23:27.881
That's a great plan.
'Cause one of them already did.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.013
This is the pilot.

23:30.038 --> 23:32.939
Is this the same woman
from the blacksite?

23:33.464 --> 23:35.196
Yeah, that's her.

23:35.265 --> 23:37.091
Who is she?

23:37.327 --> 23:39.991
Quinn Bonita, CIA
company woman for 15 years,

23:40.016 --> 23:41.834
first as an undercover field officer,

23:41.859 --> 23:43.258
then as one of the youngest

23:43.283 --> 23:45.116
foreign station chiefs in history.

23:45.168 --> 23:47.235
Multiple honors, multiple promotions.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.706
If she was so smart, why didn't she use

23:48.731 --> 23:49.803
an alias on the manifest?

23:49.828 --> 23:51.476
Because whatever attack she's planning,

23:51.501 --> 23:52.900
she wants the world
to think she's dead.

23:52.925 --> 23:54.291
Or that she's the one that did it.

23:54.316 --> 23:56.816
Great. So where the hell is she?

23:59.462 --> 24:02.682
Hello, welcome back. I'll need
to see your credentials...

24:13.453 --> 24:15.759
Signal's jammed. This is it.

24:16.406 --> 24:19.004
Anyone who makes it out alive
will be paid well

24:19.029 --> 24:21.229
and given new lives
with America's thanks.

24:21.298 --> 24:23.158
Let's go.

24:28.637 --> 24:29.904
I don't get it.

24:29.929 --> 24:32.252
Quinn reads like
a CIA recruitment poster.

24:32.277 --> 24:34.110
Why go rogue 15 years in?

24:34.135 --> 24:35.217
Because of this.

24:35.242 --> 24:37.372
Her husband was an
undercover CIA officer, too.

24:37.397 --> 24:39.404
Jason Bonita... he was working

24:39.429 --> 24:40.978
in the Middle East
when he was captured.

24:41.003 --> 24:43.776
The CIA disavowed him,
claimed he was a grad student.

24:43.801 --> 24:46.417
I remember that. The story went
public just after he was killed.

24:46.442 --> 24:49.059
Because his captors posted a
public video of his beheading.

24:49.084 --> 24:51.539
And Quinn kept working
for the CIA after that?

24:51.772 --> 24:53.612
How was she not completely destroyed?

24:53.682 --> 24:56.149
She was, but she turned it into fuel.

24:56.217 --> 24:57.617
I saw her give a talk at Langley.

24:57.642 --> 24:58.841
She dedicated her entire career

24:58.866 --> 25:00.194
to taking down those responsible.

25:00.219 --> 25:01.536
Quinn just pulled a group of criminals

25:01.561 --> 25:03.113
out of a CIA blacksite.

25:03.138 --> 25:05.152
Because she wants to take
down those responsible.

25:05.177 --> 25:06.763
What if she doesn't mean the people

25:06.788 --> 25:08.620
who captured her husband?

25:08.670 --> 25:10.670
What if she means the people
who didn't get him back?

25:10.695 --> 25:13.095
She's about to attack the CIA.

25:13.301 --> 25:14.867
Hey!

25:17.239 --> 25:18.938
Please, no, don't shoot!

25:32.640 --> 25:34.874
Is there any connection
between Quinn and the prisoners?

25:34.929 --> 25:36.780
Anything that could
point us to her target?

25:36.835 --> 25:38.668
- There's not gonna be a connection.
- Why not?

25:38.693 --> 25:40.732
Because Quinn's smart and
there doesn't need to be.

25:40.757 --> 25:42.134
Raise your hand
if you've ever been held

25:42.159 --> 25:43.812
and tortured in a CIA blacksite.

25:43.837 --> 25:45.440
There's two thoughts
that get you through.

25:45.465 --> 25:46.644
Freedom and revenge.

25:46.669 --> 25:47.835
Quinn offered them both.

25:47.869 --> 25:49.943
- Fair point.
- I just put the CIA's

25:49.968 --> 25:51.465
New York headquarters on high alert.

25:51.490 --> 25:52.944
Has anyone heard from Keaton?

25:52.969 --> 25:55.053
No. Why? You still can't reach him?

25:55.078 --> 25:57.392
No. And no one from
headquarters has seen him.

25:57.498 --> 25:59.636
- You try his house?
- He's not there.

25:59.661 --> 26:02.668
He said he was going to
the office and there's onl...

26:04.024 --> 26:05.508
He meant his other office.

26:05.538 --> 26:07.030
What other office?

26:07.055 --> 26:08.947
He sometimes works out of an outpost

26:08.972 --> 26:10.246
for undercover operatives.

26:10.293 --> 26:11.766
- Where is it?
- It's classified.

26:11.796 --> 26:13.620
Seriously? That's the line you
want to take with us right now?

26:13.644 --> 26:15.338
I mean it is classified from me.

26:15.363 --> 26:16.755
I am not an undercover officer.

26:16.780 --> 26:19.095
I don't know where the
undercover outpost is.

26:19.201 --> 26:20.748
But Quinn does.

26:20.794 --> 26:22.609
Both her and her husband
were undercover

26:22.634 --> 26:24.317
and there were both based
here in New York.

26:24.342 --> 26:25.935
That's got to be what she's attacking.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.185
It says here her
non-official cover identity

26:28.210 --> 26:30.198
was a special collections librarian.

26:30.245 --> 26:32.171
And her husband's was a grad student.

26:32.214 --> 26:35.447
Keaton said he was a
bibliographic specialist

26:35.508 --> 26:38.527
or something. I... I don't remember.

26:38.592 --> 26:40.592
I wasn't listening. It
sounded so lame and boring.

26:40.617 --> 26:42.712
All those jobs have
something in common.

26:42.811 --> 26:45.629
They can all be found
at research universities.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.662
Yeah, but look at the map.

26:47.687 --> 26:51.088
How do we know which library
is the secret CIA outpost?

26:51.205 --> 26:54.233
Leftover pieces, nothing
to glue back together...

26:54.913 --> 26:56.859
It's Bellmore.

26:56.937 --> 26:58.803
- How do you know?
- Just trust me.

26:58.866 --> 27:01.300
There are four libraries at
Bellmore, so which one is it?

27:01.376 --> 27:04.144
This one. It's right around
the corner from the gas station

27:04.195 --> 27:05.557
that Keaton and I use as a dead drop.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.882
He chose it because
it's close to the outpost.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.929
So you weren't gonna tell me
about the Crawford connection?

27:12.954 --> 27:14.256
What connection?

27:14.289 --> 27:15.997
Those planes were purchased years ago

27:16.022 --> 27:17.303
with discretionary funds.

27:17.328 --> 27:20.127
Okay. You do know
I'm running a task force

27:20.152 --> 27:21.485
investigating him, right?

27:21.510 --> 27:23.860
Right, and you know that
there are hundreds of tattoos

27:23.885 --> 27:25.812
on Jane Doe's body, so you expect us

27:25.837 --> 27:27.137
to memorize them all, right?

27:27.162 --> 27:28.361
Don't give me that, all right?

27:28.389 --> 27:31.167
Dragonfly is just a logo
and we sure as hell

27:31.192 --> 27:32.546
made sure to protect that project.

27:32.571 --> 27:33.925
So what would you have had us do?

27:33.950 --> 27:35.392
- Change planes.
- Ah!

27:35.417 --> 27:36.518
Change flight paths.

27:36.543 --> 27:38.016
Increase security.

27:38.041 --> 27:40.486
Literally anything
to protect our officers,

27:40.520 --> 27:42.303
instead of sitting back
and doing nothing.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.963
Where's your gun?

27:44.988 --> 27:46.519
We don't have guns on
the operation floor.

27:46.607 --> 27:47.817
Where's your damn gun, Robert?

27:47.842 --> 27:50.877
It's in the safe in the corner.

27:52.439 --> 27:53.572
Oh.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.329
- Quinn.
- Robert...

27:57.679 --> 27:59.543
Quinn, what are you doing?

27:59.789 --> 28:01.678
Jake, I didn't know you'd be here.

28:01.812 --> 28:04.193
I'm sorry you're getting caught
up in this, I always liked you.

28:04.232 --> 28:05.931
We thought you died in the crash.

28:06.273 --> 28:09.141
I died the day my husband did.

28:47.674 --> 28:49.181
There's no one here.

28:49.236 --> 28:51.294
This doesn't make sense.

28:54.227 --> 28:55.860
You're right.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.770
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

29:10.891 --> 29:13.072
It's me, it's me. It's me.

29:13.157 --> 29:16.092
Tom. What's... How did you...

29:16.123 --> 29:17.572
Blake, Blake, listen to me.

29:17.666 --> 29:18.799
I need you to keep it together

29:18.824 --> 29:20.198
just a little longer, okay?

29:20.262 --> 29:21.564
Things went wrong. The rescue team

29:21.589 --> 29:23.289
can't hold off the
kidnappers much longer.

29:23.314 --> 29:25.514
We need to get out
of here right now, okay?

29:33.255 --> 29:34.487
What the hell is going on?

29:34.512 --> 29:36.212
Follow me.

29:51.316 --> 29:53.506
We have to rush the gunmen.

29:53.736 --> 29:56.270
We won't all live, but we
can't let this play out.

29:56.476 --> 29:57.825
Just tell me when to move.

29:59.988 --> 30:01.654
No talking, please.

30:11.446 --> 30:13.403
I spent my life fighting terrorism,

30:13.428 --> 30:15.328
but the CIA is the biggest terrorist

30:15.353 --> 30:17.153
organization in the world.

30:17.242 --> 30:19.774
They use their own people
and kill them,

30:19.799 --> 30:21.977
do it again and again
without a second thought.

30:22.077 --> 30:23.271
Well, no more.

30:23.315 --> 30:25.354
Today, I give the Central
Intelligence Agency

30:25.379 --> 30:27.885
and the American people
something to think about.

30:30.188 --> 30:32.495
Stop, Quinn. Don't.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.122
I'm the deputy director.

30:34.147 --> 30:35.950
You'll send a stronger
message if you kill me.

30:35.975 --> 30:37.474
You're next, Jake.

30:37.694 --> 30:39.762
But the honor of going first
belongs to Robert.

30:39.787 --> 30:41.634
He's the reason we're all here.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.707
He sent Jason on an unsanctioned op,

30:43.742 --> 30:45.742
then abandoned him
when he was captured.

30:45.917 --> 30:49.085
Your husband knew exactly
what he was signing on for.

30:49.399 --> 30:50.825
Both of you did.

30:50.923 --> 30:52.823
You could have gone looking for him.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.242
We wanted proof of life.

30:55.327 --> 30:56.750
You wouldn't pay for his release.

30:56.775 --> 30:58.097
We don't negotiate.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.556
No, you negotiate <i>for</i> terrorists.

31:01.100 --> 31:04.801
You spend all this time
and energy and resources

31:04.826 --> 31:07.480
to rendition monsters just to
lock them in your blacksites

31:07.505 --> 31:09.939
and you won't lift a finger
to help your own people.

31:09.988 --> 31:12.055
Well, now I've let some monsters out

31:12.080 --> 31:13.663
and it's time to reap what you've sown.

31:13.688 --> 31:15.888
Quinn, please. He killed him, Jake.

31:15.913 --> 31:18.821
He let Jason be murdered
in front of the whole world.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.236
Now it's his turn.

31:20.299 --> 31:21.565
This won't bring Jason back.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.954
I know. But it's all I've got.

32:01.266 --> 32:03.340
Things went bad
as soon as we got there.

32:03.540 --> 32:06.296
We had to shoot our way in.
We got pinned down.

32:06.672 --> 32:09.233
There's no one here.
This doesn't make sense.

32:09.332 --> 32:11.784
If it wasn't for your men
holding off the kidnappers,

32:11.857 --> 32:13.246
the three of us
wouldn't have made it out.

32:13.271 --> 32:14.771
They're all dead?

32:18.436 --> 32:20.403
They saved our lives.

32:21.514 --> 32:23.680
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

32:23.892 --> 32:25.930
It's not your fault.

32:26.085 --> 32:28.018
You must have been terrified.

32:28.597 --> 32:30.654
I'm happy to be alive.

32:30.822 --> 32:33.307
And out of that damn
sensory deprivation.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.075
I feel crazy.

32:35.153 --> 32:38.092
And you didn't see or hear anything?

32:38.122 --> 32:40.790
Nothing that could help us
find the people that did this?

32:41.019 --> 32:43.193
No, I'm sorry, it just...

32:43.337 --> 32:45.737
All I remember is Tom saving me.

32:46.038 --> 32:48.051
Prince Charming over here.

32:48.778 --> 32:50.511
All right.

32:50.828 --> 32:52.344
What do you say we call it a night?

32:52.369 --> 32:55.370
Yes, it's late. We have
a long flight ahead of us.

32:56.410 --> 32:58.844
Thank you for everything, Hank.

33:00.057 --> 33:03.303
And Mr. Jakeman. Thank you.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.216
I had my misgivings,
but you saved my boy.

33:06.535 --> 33:08.967
I don't know what I would have done.

33:10.342 --> 33:13.573
Sorry, it's been a long night. Yeah.

33:13.632 --> 33:16.099
- To a better tomorrow.
- Yeah.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.661
Yes, indeed.

33:35.477 --> 33:38.326
You and your task force cut it
pretty close back there.

33:38.424 --> 33:39.906
We like to keep it interesting.

33:39.931 --> 33:41.790
Yeah, well, thanks.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.337
You should thank Cade.

33:43.648 --> 33:47.249
Yeah. I'll drop by his cell sometime.

33:48.542 --> 33:50.022
Please tell me you didn't.

33:50.047 --> 33:52.180
He's a terrorist.
But we gave him a deal.

33:52.297 --> 33:54.607
Yeah, and we got
what we needed from him

33:54.679 --> 33:56.693
and now his deal is in a burn bag.

33:56.718 --> 33:59.452
Cade chose to help us. He could've run,

33:59.498 --> 34:01.225
he could've just saved himself.

34:01.266 --> 34:02.938
Look, Sandstorm operatives

34:02.963 --> 34:05.730
are detained indefinitely, full stop.

34:05.951 --> 34:08.130
By that logic, Jane
should be locked up, too.

34:08.219 --> 34:09.764
Jane was locked up.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.748
Jane escaped and Jane
had friends in high places.

34:12.871 --> 34:14.755
You weren't the one
who had to interrogate her.

34:14.781 --> 34:17.400
I mean, keeping her locked up
is more trouble than it's worth.

34:17.482 --> 34:19.416
This isn't right.

34:20.799 --> 34:23.367
Look, there is no right.

34:23.465 --> 34:25.098
There's just how it is.

34:25.183 --> 34:27.737
Cade's going back to the blacksite.

34:28.846 --> 34:30.643
What am I supposed to tell him?

34:30.768 --> 34:34.795
You look him right in the eye
and you lie to him.

34:34.918 --> 34:36.447
And I'm sure I don't
have to tell you this,

34:36.472 --> 34:39.338
but as far as the rest
of the team's concerned,

34:39.710 --> 34:42.485
Cade got his deal. Yeah?

34:42.632 --> 34:44.199
Yeah.

34:51.096 --> 34:52.608
You stop the attack?

34:52.661 --> 34:53.931
Yeah, we got her.

34:54.315 --> 34:55.855
We want to thank you again
for coming to us.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.083
Wasn't trying to be noble.

34:57.108 --> 34:58.374
Just wanted my life back.

34:58.399 --> 34:59.861
Well, it won't be long now.

34:59.918 --> 35:01.860
Where's my deal? I want a copy.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.237
It's waiting for you at the hotel.

35:03.262 --> 35:04.640
We're processing your release.

35:04.690 --> 35:06.673
Gonna take you there,
get you cleaned up,

35:06.698 --> 35:09.156
get you something to eat,
and then you'll be free to go.

35:09.863 --> 35:11.348
Sounds good.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.915
One step closer, she dies!

35:22.534 --> 35:24.068
Look, Cade, nobody has to die here.

35:24.135 --> 35:25.888
- You lied to me!
- What are you talking about?

35:25.913 --> 35:27.290
You won't show me the deal.

35:27.356 --> 35:29.269
I know how that works. You're lying!

35:29.343 --> 35:31.002
No, that's not how we do things here.

35:31.027 --> 35:32.766
No, you just let the CIA do it for you.

35:32.791 --> 35:34.173
Don't move!

35:35.117 --> 35:37.078
Jane, you have the main door.

35:37.103 --> 35:38.382
I'll go around the side.

35:38.407 --> 35:39.443
Just let her go.

35:39.468 --> 35:40.977
All you have to do is let her go
and you're still free.

35:41.001 --> 35:42.156
We can chalk this up to fried nerves.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.379
You're still lying!

35:43.381 --> 35:44.847
Was that even my son?

35:44.849 --> 35:46.182
- I understand...
- Was it?

35:46.184 --> 35:47.294
You've been through a lot today.

35:47.319 --> 35:48.958
- You're tired.
- Was that my son?

35:48.983 --> 35:50.182
Of course it was.

35:50.805 --> 35:52.188
Then why didn't Joe come in?

35:52.213 --> 35:53.347
- Huh?
- I don't know.

35:53.391 --> 35:55.391
Joe wasn't even here, was he?

35:55.728 --> 35:57.765
Look, I just wanted my family back.

36:14.925 --> 36:16.412
I know what you did.

36:16.612 --> 36:18.047
And what's that?

36:18.552 --> 36:20.449
You had Blake and Junior kidnapped

36:20.949 --> 36:23.219
so you could use it
to get close to Jean-Paul.

36:23.328 --> 36:26.455
- To a better tomorrow.
- Yes, indeed.

36:26.615 --> 36:28.424
You never wanted to pay the ransom.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.493
You wanted a reason
to take Jean-Paul's side

36:30.540 --> 36:31.721
when I objected.

36:31.746 --> 36:32.929
Jean-Paul's right.

36:33.365 --> 36:34.797
We need to send a message.

36:35.279 --> 36:36.899
But something went wrong.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.625
You got cold feet.

36:38.705 --> 36:40.236
I must have gotten in your head.

36:40.402 --> 36:41.878
If something goes wrong
and they have to choose

36:41.902 --> 36:43.443
between Blake and Junior,

36:43.575 --> 36:44.842
they won't choose her.

36:44.929 --> 36:46.382
So you, uh...

36:46.509 --> 36:48.911
You called the whole thing off.

36:49.168 --> 36:51.914
That's why they had already gone
by the time we showed up.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.284
Or maybe they were the ones
who got cold feet.

36:55.626 --> 36:57.626
Or maybe they were paid to walk away.

36:58.647 --> 37:00.423
Who killed Jean-Paul's men?

37:00.738 --> 37:01.903
I did.

37:01.938 --> 37:03.004
They wouldn't have stopped

37:03.029 --> 37:05.110
until they found
the people responsible,

37:05.242 --> 37:06.541
which was you.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.265
So you were protecting me.

37:09.386 --> 37:11.167
Why keep a loose end
if you don't have to?

37:11.419 --> 37:14.470
Now no one will ever know
the truth, except us.

37:14.675 --> 37:16.282
And why would you cover for me?

37:16.307 --> 37:18.174
You're a smart man.

37:18.487 --> 37:20.353
I trust you had your reasons
for doing what you did

37:20.378 --> 37:21.811
just like I had mine.

37:21.962 --> 37:24.457
But now I know how far
you're willing to go

37:24.968 --> 37:28.400
to get what you want,
and now you know how far

37:28.480 --> 37:31.320
I'm willing to go for you.

37:32.526 --> 37:34.490
What about Blake?

37:35.034 --> 37:36.396
I love her,

37:36.949 --> 37:39.528
so I'll never tell her what you did.

37:40.230 --> 37:42.130
It'd destroy her.

37:46.436 --> 37:48.836
I've liked you from the minute we met.

37:51.322 --> 37:56.325
And I always knew that you would be

37:56.704 --> 38:00.883
a welcome addition
to this family, and...

38:03.460 --> 38:05.960
I appreciate your silence.

38:18.482 --> 38:20.236
But...

38:20.428 --> 38:23.005
now you know my secret,

38:23.827 --> 38:26.208
which means you have to die.

38:30.864 --> 38:31.991
Yeah, but don't worry,

38:32.016 --> 38:35.577
I'm not gonna stab you
like I did Victor.

38:35.720 --> 38:39.221
That poison that you're drinking...

38:41.551 --> 38:43.532
it'll do just fine.

38:49.626 --> 38:51.901
Your face.

38:55.112 --> 38:56.639
I'm just messing with you.

38:57.038 --> 38:58.865
Okay, relax, relax.

39:00.044 --> 39:02.078
Good job today.

39:02.246 --> 39:04.246
Good job.

39:11.570 --> 39:13.066
Another day at the office, huh?

39:13.091 --> 39:14.527
Yeah, you know.

39:14.687 --> 39:16.182
Punch in, punch out.

39:16.648 --> 39:18.594
You ever think about
coming back to the FBI?

39:18.841 --> 39:21.097
Sometimes.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.901
But then I feel like I found my calling

39:22.926 --> 39:24.459
over on the dark side.

39:24.813 --> 39:26.880
Yeah, but at what cost?

39:28.265 --> 39:30.739
Earlier today, you told me,
do whatever it takes.

39:31.251 --> 39:32.824
That is what Keaton does.

39:32.849 --> 39:33.997
He makes the hard decisions

39:34.022 --> 39:35.696
so everybody else doesn't have to.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.344
Yeah, but they're bad decisions.

39:37.369 --> 39:39.269
No, they're just different.

39:39.294 --> 39:42.847
I know you don't believe in
Keaton's way, but I do.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.316
That's why I left.

39:59.137 --> 40:00.670
Hey.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.603
Sorry you had to wait around all night.

40:03.690 --> 40:05.290
It's okay.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.403
It's given me time to think.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.806
Well, we can take you
home now if you're ready.

40:10.768 --> 40:12.715
Home.

40:12.857 --> 40:14.857
Where is that?

40:16.602 --> 40:19.403
My father killed people.

40:19.517 --> 40:23.085
I feel like I don't...
I don't know anything.

40:23.699 --> 40:25.359
I mean...

40:26.586 --> 40:29.294
that has to be why he
killed himself, right?

40:29.808 --> 40:32.375
It just became too much for him.

40:32.590 --> 40:34.990
It was causing him
so much pain that he just...

40:39.817 --> 40:41.917
It just hurts, you know?

40:42.027 --> 40:45.557
The weight of that, escaping that

40:45.582 --> 40:48.416
meant more to him
than staying here with me.

40:49.170 --> 40:52.553
Avery, we can never

40:52.711 --> 40:55.188
truly know someone else's pain.

40:55.287 --> 40:59.155
What your dad did to himself,
to other people,

40:59.578 --> 41:01.842
it doesn't mean he didn't love you.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.936
Families can do terrible,
selfish things

41:06.158 --> 41:08.658
and still love each other.

41:10.662 --> 41:12.192
I'm sorry.

41:12.244 --> 41:15.378
If you want to let it out,
then just let it out.

41:24.636 --> 41:26.795
I'm so sorry you
had to go through this.

41:34.365 --> 41:36.858
Hey, Anthony,
how was your Friday night?

41:37.042 --> 41:38.538
Oh, you know, pretty good.

41:38.616 --> 41:40.616
Thawing out some guy's
dead frozen body,

41:40.641 --> 41:42.809
dumped him in the river,
grabbed a slice, you?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.467
Hey, look, you heard the man.

41:44.492 --> 41:46.659
He said he need this
popsicle to wash up.

41:46.712 --> 41:47.999
You ready?

41:48.193 --> 41:49.392
- On three.
- Hey, give me a sec, man.

41:49.454 --> 41:50.587
My back is killing me.

41:50.695 --> 41:52.024
Hey, man, you killing me.

41:52.097 --> 41:53.764
Lift with your knees.

41:55.044 --> 41:56.830
On three.

41:56.975 --> 41:59.482
One, two...

41:59.537 --> 42:00.635
three!
