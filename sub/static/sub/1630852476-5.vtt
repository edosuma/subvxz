WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:03.168
Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:04.878
We have chosen
the perfect ingredient

00:04.922 --> 00:06.839
for today's challenge--
poultry.

00:06.882 --> 00:10.426
Nyesha:
The person that's won safety
for their team?

00:10.428 --> 00:13.262
- The squab dish.
- Finally, I'm number one.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.055
Gordon:
Team nyesha and team richard

00:15.099 --> 00:16.515
are now gonna have to
nominate their chef

00:16.559 --> 00:19.351
that's gonna go head to head
in the elimination battle.

00:19.395 --> 00:22.646
The least favorite dish
was the chicken and the sage.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.648
Sergio, it's time to go home.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.775
Bloody well done to courtney.

00:26.819 --> 00:31.613
Before our next challenge,
you need something more than
just words to inspire you.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.323
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:33.409 --> 00:35.284
Devonnie:
This is the first field trip
of the competition.

00:35.327 --> 00:39.413
Today's challenge,
we want you to create a burger
worthy of the next level.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.665
- Let's get it, baby.
Let's get it.
- Fire in the basement!

00:41.709 --> 00:43.375
- ( alarm beeping )
- this is horrible.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.003
The idea is to cook
in the basement,
not set it on fire, yes?

00:46.088 --> 00:48.172
- I can't swallow that.
- We have one dish
that's so bad,

00:48.174 --> 00:51.508
this chef is gonna be lucky
to be cooking again
even in the elimination.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.680
<i> ( music playing )</i>

01:10.154 --> 01:11.737
welcome. Come on in.

01:11.781 --> 01:14.740
Devonnie:<i> This is wild.</i>

01:14.784 --> 01:16.658
This is the first field trip
of the competition

01:16.660 --> 01:18.619
<i> to gordon ramsay burger.</i>

01:18.662 --> 01:20.287
<i> Can I sit down?</i>
<i> Can I order something?</i>

01:20.331 --> 01:22.081
<i> Are we staying here</i>
<i>for a while? Can I get a drink?</i>

01:22.124 --> 01:23.165
Bartender?

01:23.209 --> 01:24.583
Right, good morning.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.085
All: Good morning, chef.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.419
Richard, nyesha, and myself

01:27.463 --> 01:30.214
thought you could use
a little inspiration.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.591
What better place to bring you
than my restaurant,

01:32.593 --> 01:34.343
gordon ramsay burger?

01:34.386 --> 01:35.552
In recent years,
the humble burger

01:35.596 --> 01:38.680
has undergone
a major upgrade, right?

01:38.724 --> 01:41.058
All: Yes, chef.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.893
Now, we are here
to inspire you all,

01:42.937 --> 01:46.313
so richard and nyesha and I
are each gonna create

01:46.357 --> 01:49.024
our own take
on our next level burger.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.818
- Sound good?
- All: Yes, chef.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.069
Let's get cracking.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.780
I'll be doing
an amazing farm burger,

01:54.824 --> 01:56.031
and it's a topped
with a fried egg

01:56.033 --> 01:57.116
with some grilled bacon.

01:57.159 --> 02:00.744
I'm going to do
a duck-duck-duck burger.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.745
- Whoo!
- Expect nothing less.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.164
My burger is inspired
by my favorite soup,

02:04.208 --> 02:05.165
the french onion soup.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.291
It's called the le burger.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.710
- Oh.
- I have a cheese blend

02:08.796 --> 02:11.755
of provolone and gruyere
that I'm gonna torch on top.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.175
I mean, whoa! Yo!

02:15.210 --> 02:17.177
I'm frying my egg,
and what I'm gonna do now

02:17.221 --> 02:20.139
is drop these little bacon bits
in there for texture.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.557
Over here,
I'm making my duck burger,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.268
and then what I'm doing
is I'm combining just humbly

02:24.270 --> 02:26.228
store-bought ketchup, right?

02:26.272 --> 02:28.522
With some pomegranate seeds.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.149
I'm going into, like,
competition mode.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.317
<i> I'm focusing on getting</i>
<i> as much information</i>

02:32.361 --> 02:34.153
as I possibly can
from all of the mentors.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.156
For me, I really want this
burger to have lots of moisture

02:37.199 --> 02:39.658
and jus and be almost decadent.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.285
- Almost?
- Almost?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.495
- And then, look, my cheese.
- Let's go!

02:43.539 --> 02:45.539
I wanna melt that
cheese over there.

02:45.583 --> 02:49.168
And there we have a delicious
gordon ramsay farm burger.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.043
- Wonderful, chef.
- Stunning.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.755
- Look at that. See it?
- That is sexy!

02:53.799 --> 02:56.300
Tell me about it, right?
Oh, yes!

02:56.343 --> 02:58.468
I'll see your
cheese pull, nyesha.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.180
( cheering )

03:01.223 --> 03:02.598
- would you like a taste?
- Yes, chef.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.599
Gordon: Yes.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.142
I wanna try all the burgers.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.018
<i> I want that one,</i>
<i> I want that one,</i>

03:06.061 --> 03:07.019
<i> I want that one, too.</i>

03:07.021 --> 03:08.729
- Get in there.
- Both: Cheers.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.147
- Clinkies.
- Gordon: Enjoy.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.149
- Those flavors!
- Oh, my gosh.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.109
- Gordon: How's that taste?
- This is amazing.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.194
Do you think after
tasting those burgers,

03:15.487 --> 03:17.446
you can now elevate your burger
to the next level?

03:17.489 --> 03:19.406
- All: Yes, chef.
- Excellent.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.534
Because for today's challenge,
we want you all

03:22.578 --> 03:25.996
to create a burger
worthy of the next level.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.457
- Is that clear? Good.
- All: Yes, chef!

03:28.500 --> 03:31.752
Let's get back to our kitchens
and make a delicious burger.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.172
What do you think, team blais?
You think you can create a
better burger than we did today?

03:35.216 --> 03:38.342
- We got it. We got it.
- That's good.
I love the confidence.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.427
Head back to the elevators
and pick a random keycard

03:40.471 --> 03:43.055
to find out what floor
you'll be cooking on.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.974
- I need to be alone.
- Yeah.

03:49.813 --> 03:50.729
Ooh, here we go.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.193
- Whoo!
- All right.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.486
- Okay.
- Bye!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.863
The type of meat
picked for this challenge
is very important.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.367
♪ get to the top,
and it'll open maybe,
please, god, please ♪

04:03.410 --> 04:06.662
so I'm hoping for the top floor
strictly for the ingredients.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.416
- Whoo!
- Yeah! Yeah!

04:11.418 --> 04:12.542
Mariah:
<i> I'm, like, super pumped up.</i>

04:12.586 --> 04:14.628
<i> We get first selection</i>
<i> of ingredients,</i>

04:14.672 --> 04:15.629
<i> the best equipment.</i>

04:15.673 --> 04:17.130
We should not screw this up.

04:17.174 --> 04:20.175
Please not the basement
for a burger challenge, please.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.969
We were just in the basement.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.012
After cooking in
the bottom kitchen last time,

04:24.056 --> 04:25.472
I don't want to be
anywhere near it.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.352
No!

04:32.106 --> 04:35.941
Why am I here again
in the depths of hell?

04:35.985 --> 04:37.359
I'm about to pass out.

04:37.403 --> 04:40.195
I said I never wanted
to see this kitchen again.

04:44.201 --> 04:48.203
Chef arrington's burger
was super inspirational to me,

04:48.247 --> 04:50.864
so I know that I can produce
an amazing burger

04:50.874 --> 04:55.419
at any level because
this challenge is truly about
creativity and flavors.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.380
- ( groans )
- thank you.

04:58.424 --> 05:01.258
- Ah!
- Yes.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.261
- Back again,
like I never left.
- We home, baby!

05:04.263 --> 05:06.305
- This is it.
- We are home.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.473
Pyet:<i> At this point</i>
<i> in the competition,</i>

05:08.517 --> 05:10.559
I'm feeling like I'm kind of
just floating through.

05:10.602 --> 05:15.439
I don't feel like
I have made the impact
that I wanted to have,

05:15.441 --> 05:17.524
and I'm really hoping
from this point on

05:17.568 --> 05:20.610
<i> to really bring pyet</i>
<i> to the competition.</i>

05:21.697 --> 05:24.323
Let's go.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.366
Oh, no.
In the basement again?

05:26.410 --> 05:28.285
- Really? What is happening?
- Let's get back
on the elevator.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.412
- Maybe we could do it again?
- Oh, boy. Right, listen up.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.582
You only have 30 minutes
to make a cracking burger.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.168
Not 45. 30 minutes.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.421
- Hello, chef.
- Let's go, guys. Gather up.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.131
- Line up. How you feeling?
- Very good.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.049
- Feeling good, chef.
- Excellent.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.176
We're gonna have
the number one dish today.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.553
- I'd love that for us! Yes!
- Yes, we are.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.556
30 minutes to cook
anything is difficult,
because the reality is,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.767
you're trying to
conceptualize your dish

05:51.810 --> 05:53.977
and also execute
at the same time.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.564
- One, two, three.
- All: Number one burger!

05:57.608 --> 05:59.316
<i> But I know my team</i>
<i> can bring it all together.</i>

05:59.318 --> 06:01.693
<i> And after visiting</i>
<i> gordon ramsay burger today,</i>

06:01.737 --> 06:04.654
<i> I want more than ever</i>
<i>to beat gordon at his own game.</i>

06:07.618 --> 06:08.533
- All right, here we go.
- Yes!

06:08.577 --> 06:09.910
- Hi, chef.
- Top floor.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.036
Not sure
if we deserve it, okay?

06:11.330 --> 06:14.247
We underperformed in
the last challenge, all right?

06:14.249 --> 06:16.708
I will be embarrassed
if one of us is in that
elimination challenge.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.709
You will not
be embarrassed today.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.630
It's really important
that team trailblaisers

06:21.673 --> 06:22.964
wins the competition today

06:23.008 --> 06:24.508
and gains safety
for all the team members.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.219
<i> Courtney fought</i>
<i> for her life last time,</i>

06:27.262 --> 06:29.346
<i> and I do not want</i>
<i> that stress again.</i>

06:29.390 --> 06:32.766
<i> We're on the top floor today,</i>
<i> so there are no excuses.</i>

06:32.810 --> 06:34.226
<i> We have to nail these burgers.</i>

06:34.311 --> 06:36.144
All right, let's go.
Grab the elevator.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.522
Okay, line up, please, guys.
Come on.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.315
- Yes, chef.
- 30 minutes.
Come on, come on, come on.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.650
We are not going
into that elimination.
I want to hear you.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.653
- No, we're not.
- No, we're not going
into elimination.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.488
Are we?
Hell no, we are not.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.198
Don't do too much.
Don't bite off more
than you can chew.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.324
All: Yes, chef.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.035
All right, team trailblaisers,
we're gonna move fast.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.620
We're mentally focused.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.543
It is time to go!

06:59.586 --> 07:01.128
Quick, quick, quick.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.212
You need a protein off the top.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.422
I'm gonna take the bison.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.590
I need a good protein,
and I just grab lamb.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.676
Richard:
Do you have something that's
gonna function as bread?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.010
- Hand me the ketchup.
- Here we go.

07:09.346 --> 07:13.140
I see a brioche bun,
but I'm thinking,
the lamb may be juicy,

07:13.142 --> 07:15.684
so my bun may be soggy.
Let me get a harder bread.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.352
<i> And I pick ciabatta bread!</i>

07:17.396 --> 07:19.980
Why? I don't know.
I don't know why I picked it.

07:19.982 --> 07:23.942
- Does anybody see bacon?
- Condiments, garnish,
protein, bread, fat.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.527
Four, three, two, one.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.155
- Does anybody see jalapenos?
- I've got them right here.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.450
Stay there if you've got to.
Raise whatever you got!

07:31.493 --> 07:33.535
- ( bleep )
- back to the tables.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.328
Nyesha: Platform's here.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.706
When that light changes green,
we're going! Go, go, go!

07:37.749 --> 07:39.291
Yes! Yes!

07:39.334 --> 07:42.419
I see-- that's sirloin.
Wagyu short rib.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.338
I have no idea what the people
on the top floor are thinking

07:45.382 --> 07:48.175
<i> to let that wagyu beef</i>
<i>slide down to the second floor.</i>

07:48.218 --> 07:50.385
Nyesha: Don't forget about
your fats, yes, guys?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.387
Amber:<i> I'm just repeating</i>
<i> in my head,</i>

07:52.431 --> 07:54.806
<i> "meat, cheese,</i>
<i> bun, condiments,"</i>

07:54.850 --> 07:57.517
and just rattling
through everything
so I don't forget.

07:57.561 --> 08:01.730
- Nyesha: Three, two, one.
- ( muttering )

08:01.773 --> 08:03.523
- come on, guys.
- Okay.

08:03.567 --> 08:07.110
Nyesha: Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.070
Go! Let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

08:09.114 --> 08:10.989
30 seconds.
Well done, kenny.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.825
What is this?
I can't see the sign-- ostrich!

08:13.869 --> 08:16.620
- Hell no.
- I wanna make sure
I grab some heat.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.538
I wanna get something sweet.
I see a mango.

08:18.624 --> 08:21.166
Boom. Got that.
I see a jalapeno. Got that.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.293
Where's the buns?
Oh, ( bleep ).

08:23.295 --> 08:24.753
- I don't know what this is.
- Ground turkey, no?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.129
- Turkey.
- Grab, grab, grab. Come on.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.797
Kenny:
<i> I see a dry aged blend. Boom.</i>

08:27.841 --> 08:30.133
Give me that,
because I can take that,
and I can make magic.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.551
- Oh, god.
- Lettuce.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.053
- Five, four...
- Did I grab an onion?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.514
- ...Three, two, one.
- An avocado.

08:35.557 --> 08:39.851
And she's moving.
Grab it, grab it, grab it,
devonnie! Grab it!

08:39.895 --> 08:42.729
- Oh, my lord.
- I don't know what
the ( bleep ) I grabbed.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.067
- Gordon:
Reuel, what'd you get?
- I have gotten ostrich.

08:47.110 --> 08:51.321
- Ostrich? Wow. Tough one.
- Yeah. I hate my life!

08:51.323 --> 08:54.241
<i> Don't want it at all.</i>
<i> Zero fat.</i>

08:54.284 --> 08:57.160
Looking up like this to all
the upper levels, like...

08:59.331 --> 09:02.290
Amber:
<i> I get back to my station</i>
<i>and I'm so pleased with myself.</i>

09:02.292 --> 09:05.335
I'm like, we got herbs,
we got this, we got--

09:05.379 --> 09:07.128
oh, my god,
I didn't grab a bread.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.757
-  <i>I didn't grab a bun. </i>
- Okay.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.677
<i> I left the most important</i>
<i> ingredient off</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:15.262
and I'm just about in tears.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.139
You better find a solution.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.523
Oh, my god,
I didn't grab a bread.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.194
You better find a solution.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.529
Amber:
<i> To have a really good burger,</i>

09:32.573 --> 09:34.823
<i> you need the ratios,</i>
<i> you need the good bun.</i>

09:34.866 --> 09:36.283
I found a solution.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.493
- Beautiful. Protein style.
- Yes.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.162
Please, good lord,
don't let this fail.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.123
30 minutes starts now, guys.
Let's go.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.458
- Zach: Rocking and rolling.
- Stay ready, okay?

09:46.920 --> 09:50.255
I'm expecting magic across
30 minutes. One burger, right?

09:50.299 --> 09:52.507
- Yes, chef.
- 'cause I wanna
beat them upstairs.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.384
- Do you wanna
beat them upstairs?
- Yes, chef.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.052
We got this.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.305
- How we doing, chef zach?
- I'm doing good.

09:58.348 --> 10:02.309
Richard:
We have to beat gordon ramsay
and nyesha arrington.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.852
- We have to win this.
- Yes, chef.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.395
- Chef, I have a question.
- Yes?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.398
I'm thinking about doing
a southern style nashville
spicy chicken burger.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.483
Keep moving while
we're talking. Okay.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.404
Having chef blais as a mentor
for this challenge is amazing.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.866
His duck burger
totally inspired me
to think outside of the box.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.869
And I'm thinking about doing
a pimento cheese using this,
the cheddar.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.037
- I love it. No, no.
- Do you think this
is gonna overpower it?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.873
You're gonna use
the jalapeno to replace
the red pepper

10:24.916 --> 10:25.957
- that usually would be
in pimento cheese?
- Exactly, yes.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.462
I go in with the intention
of looking for chicken,

10:30.464 --> 10:33.089
which is not considered
a high end ingredient,

10:33.133 --> 10:36.176
<i> but I want to do something</i>
<i> that will make me stand out</i>

10:36.219 --> 10:38.136
<i> from the rest</i>
<i> of my competition.</i>

10:38.138 --> 10:40.847
Let's go.
We are slow starters
over here usually.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.515
- I know.
- You got your two lamb patties.

10:42.893 --> 10:46.102
- What's the sauce gonna be?
- The sauce, I'm thinking
lemon aioli, for sure,

10:46.146 --> 10:49.064
- but I kind of wanna add
shallots to it for a kick.
- Okay, yeah.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.774
I wanna push myself
to try something new.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.735
<i> I want the mentors to see</i>
<i> that I not only know</i>
<i> asian flavors,</i>

10:53.779 --> 10:55.320
but I know
other flavors as well.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.406
I'm going to do
a fresh greek approach.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.824
<i> I feel like</i>
<i> the longer I'm here,</i>

11:00.202 --> 11:03.536
the more they will see
what my best and greatest
dish looks like.

11:03.580 --> 11:07.207
Okay, you know exactly
what you're doing.
Keep going with it.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.460
Nyesha: We wanna make sure
that we're getting on

11:10.504 --> 11:12.837
what takes the longest
to cook first, right?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.964
- Yes, chef.
- What do we got?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.801
- Wagyu short rib.
- Beautiful. Great grab.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.720
- I kinda wanted to put
a little bit of me on this.
- Okay, beautiful.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.014
I'm gonna make
what's called wojapi.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.975
It's a native-american
braised berry sauce.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.435
- Excellent.
- Wojapi sauce is sweet.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.688
I'm typically eating it
on toast

11:29.731 --> 11:31.398
or I'll add it to yogurt.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.316
But I don't know
if something that sweet

11:33.318 --> 11:35.151
would go well on a burger,

11:35.195 --> 11:37.612
and I definitely don't
want to disappoint myself,

11:37.656 --> 11:40.156
disappoint my ancestors
for even trying to do this.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.616
- Wojapi.
- Wojapi.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.243
So you're sort of
doing a play on that?

11:43.286 --> 11:45.161
Yeah, so it's more
a berry barbeque sauce, yeah.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.329
Okay, okay. Cool.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.998
So I'm having to be
extremely careful

11:49.042 --> 11:50.166
with what I'm doing today.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.334
That's exciting, pyet.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.544
Angie:
Char up for me, baby.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.797
I have to say, chef angie,
great grab on that elk as well.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.258
- That's one of the best-tasting
game meats around.
- Thank you, chef.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.384
It's gonna be delicious.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.927
I'm gonna roast
both these peppers

12:01.012 --> 12:02.220
and then make a sauce.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.724
I may have entered this contest
with a little imposter syndrome,

12:05.767 --> 12:08.393
<i> but now two times in a row,</i>

12:08.395 --> 12:12.230
<i> I've been so, so close to</i>
<i> winning top dish for my team.</i>

12:12.274 --> 12:15.233
I'm also gonna render it down
and put it on my bun.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.152
This is some next level
right here.

12:17.195 --> 12:21.114
I am more sure than ever that
I have the next level chef
on my team.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.116
<i> These guys are bringing it</i>
<i> and they're excited.</i>

12:23.118 --> 12:26.119
It's palpable.
You can feel the energy
coming out of this kitchen.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.038
- Winning dishes only.
- Yes, chef.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.375
So, we're five minutes in
with 25 minutes to go.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.628
Make those scream.
Now tell me about the burger.
Where are we going?

12:35.672 --> 12:37.422
I'm gonna do a pimento cheese,
a bacon jam.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.423
Love that idea.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.383
- The dry aged beef.
- Yes, sir.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.218
- That's the sort
of chefy burger, right?
- Absolutely.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.888
<i> I'm a making</i>
<i> a dry age blend burger</i>

12:44.931 --> 12:47.432
<i> with pimento cheese,</i>
<i> fried tomatoes,</i>
<i> and a bacon jam.</i>

12:47.476 --> 12:49.184
I'm honed in
on getting this right,

12:49.227 --> 12:51.603
<i> and I'm still thinking</i>
<i> about gordon ramsay burger.</i>

12:51.646 --> 12:54.230
That gave me that drive
to know that my mentor,

12:54.274 --> 12:57.400
the man who's right here
inspiring me,
I have to do this.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.528
- Get this burger
to the next level.
- Absolutely. For sure.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.071
- That way you'll stay out
of elimination, yes?
- For sure.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.450
Right, all of you,
what goes well with a burger?

13:05.494 --> 13:06.493
- Potatoes?
- Potatoes, chef.

13:06.828 --> 13:11.206
- Potatoes, that's right.
- Well, we're ( bleep ).

13:11.249 --> 13:13.374
Richard: All right, listen up,
team trailblaisers.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.294
You gotta go grab
one whole basket of potatoes.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.797
Why? Why are there potatoes?
Potatoes take so long to cook.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.175
You know, fries, potato salad,
chips, whatever it is.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.551
A potato side.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.595
I don't think there's any time
for us to be frying

13:25.639 --> 13:26.596
some potatoes right now.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.972
<i> We are stressed as hell.</i>

13:28.016 --> 13:29.390
I can barely make
this damn burger.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.726
Oh, here we go.
A nice side.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.230
One basket of potatoes each.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.191
Think about size.
Think about texture.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.485
Think about flavor, right?

13:40.487 --> 13:45.031
15 seconds.
Grab one basket of potatoes.
Let's go!

13:45.033 --> 13:47.283
Fries, tater tots,
mashed potatoes,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.994
chips, crisps, you name it.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.205
Excellent. Well done.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.374
Do we have mandolines down here?

13:54.417 --> 13:57.836
- Did you ask for a mandoline?
- Yes, chef.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.754
There's no basement kitchen
anywhere in the u.S. Tonight

13:59.798 --> 14:01.840
- with a mandoline,
let me tell you.
- Yes, chef.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.925
You've been spoiled,
haven't you?
A top floor girl.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.260
Oh, my god.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.719
- Reuel.
- Yes, chef?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.555
- You've got the ostrich, yeah?
- Yes.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.181
Between you and I
and all three floors,

14:10.225 --> 14:12.517
quite possibly
the toughest protein.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.228
- So we need fries.
What'd you get?
- Russet.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.522
- An amazing potato
for fries, yes?
- Yes.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.440
- What are you gonna do?
- Right now, I'm thinking

14:19.484 --> 14:23.027
I'm gonna incorporate it
into my leek rings.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.737
So, leek rings,
almost like the onion ring?

14:24.781 --> 14:26.322
- Yes, chef.
- Okay, the secret here

14:26.366 --> 14:27.699
is to stay out
of that elimination.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.951
- I'm gonna make it.
- Good.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.829
- What'd you get?
- I'm honestly not too sure,
chef. It's purple.

14:32.831 --> 14:36.457
- Yeah, so purple potatoes.
- I'm going to fry
the avocados into fries

14:36.501 --> 14:39.210
- and then pickle the cucumbers.
- Wow. So, you're doing
avocado fries?

14:39.254 --> 14:42.755
- Yes, chef. Pork, chef.
- You got pork, right?

14:42.799 --> 14:45.133
Now that's a tough one,
but it could be delicious.

14:45.176 --> 14:48.595
Last time, I had best dish,
and I saved my team.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.513
So that's a lot of pressure.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.099
<i> I'm just trying to get</i>
<i> this burger cooked perfectly.</i>

14:53.143 --> 14:54.392
Gordon: We gotta go, guys.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.269
We are not losing.
Let's go.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.274
Grease fire. Oh, my god.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.984
- ( bleep )
- gordon: Fire in the basement!

15:03.028 --> 15:04.319
I'm ( bleep ).

15:04.362 --> 15:05.570
Kenny: Come on,
get that fire out of there.

15:05.614 --> 15:09.157
- Watch your hands.
- What is happening?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.617
<i> We are already in hell, baby.</i>

15:10.660 --> 15:12.201
We don't need any more fire
down here.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.162
Watch out! ( bleep )

15:14.205 --> 15:16.456
- ow.
- When chef ramsay picked me,

15:16.458 --> 15:19.334
<i> it was probably one of the</i>
<i> happiest moments of my life.</i>

15:19.377 --> 15:23.713
And I'm like,
"damn. Chef ramsay, how much
do you regret it right now?"

15:23.757 --> 15:25.381
( bleep )

15:25.383 --> 15:26.674
man!

15:26.718 --> 15:27.675
( bleep )

15:27.719 --> 15:29.594
oh, my ( bleep ) god.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.517
Fire in the basement!

15:36.561 --> 15:38.186
Watch your hands.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.270
This is horrible.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.231
<i> I've never set a fire</i>
<i> in my life.</i>

15:43.401 --> 15:45.777
I am so mad at myself
right now.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.028
Man!

15:47.030 --> 15:48.237
Tricia: Moron.

15:49.532 --> 15:52.533
Now we're focusing on the things
that you know you can get done.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.620
Team blais cannot afford
to lose another team member.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.330
Team trailblaisers, top floor,

15:57.332 --> 16:00.291
<i> we have some classic burger</i>
<i> combinations up here,</i>

16:00.335 --> 16:03.795
but we have no room for error.
We have to be perfect.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.338
All right, courtney,
you're over here at the sirloin.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.091
You got a juicy burger.
It's been seasoned, right?
It's been seasoned well?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.300
- It's definitely been seasoned.
- Okay.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.387
<i> I'm making a sirloin burger,</i>
<i> a jalapeno special sauce,</i>

16:12.430 --> 16:14.639
<i> crispy bacon,</i>
<i> and a fried egg on top.</i>

16:14.641 --> 16:17.558
That's a big burger.
You got a fork or something?

16:17.560 --> 16:20.853
Just poke a couple holes in it,
so it doesn't ball up,
all right?

16:20.897 --> 16:23.231
- Especially when you're cooking
a big burger. Good job.
- Thank you.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.358
<i> So now that I've experienced</i>
<i> the elimination,</i>

16:25.402 --> 16:28.194
there's no room for mistakes.

16:28.238 --> 16:32.407
Every single cook that I go into
after that elimination cook,

16:32.450 --> 16:35.118
I have to bring it
no matter what.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.120
Richard:
Jonathan, what do you think
we got going on here?

16:37.163 --> 16:41.332
We've got brisket here.
Maybe go classic american,
but also a little spicy.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.752
- Hit with a red pepper
garlic confit aioli.
- Okay. I love it.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.838
Jonathan:<i> I'm feeling all right</i>
<i> about my performance</i>
<i> in this competition.</i>

16:46.881 --> 16:48.840
I did well the first round
when we were picking teams.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.093
<i> The second round I came</i>
<i> in second. Third round I won.</i>

16:52.137 --> 16:54.053
Last time left
a little bit to be desired

16:54.097 --> 16:56.222
with that turkey,
but didn't end up in the bottom.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.224
But the turkey shook me
a little bit.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.561
All right, jonathan,
you gotta move.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.896
I'm worried about the pace
right now, okay?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.314
My nerves are crawling
all over me.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.025
<i> I'm trying to bust up</i>
<i> out of that,</i>

17:07.027 --> 17:08.359
<i> but I am nervous for sure.</i>

17:08.403 --> 17:10.111
We're cruising up
on 15 minutes, all right?

17:10.155 --> 17:11.612
That's not a lot of time.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.031
- Chef?
- Yes?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.824
My burger bun got smashed.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.452
All right, listen,
you can used this smashed bun
if you want.

17:17.495 --> 17:20.538
- Okay.
- Or you can figure out
how to do a lettuce wrap.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.457
Okay. It's a rough day
in the kitchen.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.667
- And you'll only grabbed
one bun, right?
- Yes, sir.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.544
- You good?
- Gonna simmer down.
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:28.423 --> 17:32.008
Right, now we're multitasking.
Potatoes should be cut.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.551
- Buns nicely toasted, yes?
- All: Yes, chef.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.180
Good. My team is down
in the basement again.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.765
<i> We avoided elimination</i>
<i> last time,</i>

17:38.767 --> 17:40.266
<i> and we need to do that again.</i>

17:40.310 --> 17:41.517
And down here, honestly,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.352
<i> already the burgers</i>
<i> are the next level.</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:45.396
- Right, what'd you get?
- Got some ground turkey, chef.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.024
- Did you want that?
- Uh, I wasn't mad at it.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.692
- Make sure it's
nicely seasoned, yes?
- Yes, chef.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.486
It's super lean.
Can be really bland.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.322
I'm gonna put a lot of flavors.
I'm gonna go caribbean
with this burger.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.325
- Please, please, please,
stay out of elimination.
- For sure, chef.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.327
There's so many moving parts
to an upscale burger,

17:59.329 --> 18:01.788
so I'm really trying
to make sure I get
everything done.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.457
- I'm out of the fryer.
- Gordon: Out of the fryer.
Thank you for letting us know.

18:04.459 --> 18:08.086
Each challenge,
I've done a little better,
but I'm such a better cook

18:08.129 --> 18:09.629
<i> than the dishes</i>
<i> that I've put out so far.</i>

18:09.672 --> 18:12.173
<i> I want to win the top dish</i>
<i> just once.</i>

18:12.217 --> 18:15.009
Okay. I didn't make an aioli.
Okay. That's okay.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.179
- 14 minutes to go, guys, yes?
- All: Yes, chef.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.223
Nyesha:
Guys, looking good.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.724
What's the plan here
with the burger?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.101
- I am doing a southern burger.
- Excellent.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.229
- I have got pimento cheese.
I've got bison.
- Oh, heck yeah!

18:26.272 --> 18:27.772
I'm gonna stuff the pimento
tarragon in the middle

18:27.816 --> 18:29.273
- because it's such a lean meat.
- Okay.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.275
Every time I watch you cook,
you get stronger,

18:31.277 --> 18:33.820
- and it's so beautiful.
- Thank you, chef.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.572
- You wanna try the sauce?
- Talk to me about it.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.534
So, there's berries, tomato,
a little bit of acid in that.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.537
- Some sweetness
with the brown sugar.
- That is exciting on my palate.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.871
- Okay, I'm happy
to hear that, chef.
- Wow.

18:44.207 --> 18:47.083
- Bringing my culture
to the forefront.
- As you should, girl.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.419
Nyesha:
<i> When someone can drive flavor</i>
<i> through their heritage</i>

18:50.463 --> 18:55.424
and bring an added level
of authenticity to your dish,
it's always gonna shine.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.051
- How we doing, chef zach?
- I'm doing good.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.261
Everything's coming
together right now.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.762
I grabbed a chuck,

18:59.806 --> 19:02.056
and I'm making
a double smash burger

19:02.100 --> 19:04.142
with bacon,
a fried cheese disc,

19:04.144 --> 19:05.935
and a spicy onion marmalade.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.020
That fried cheese
situation sounds amazing.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.814
- It's milwaukee staple
right there.
- Oh!

19:09.858 --> 19:11.357
If you're not
frying your cheese,
you're not from around there.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.067
Bring it.
Nice looking smash.

19:13.528 --> 19:19.157
I got a body by burgers,
so I'd been doing them injustice
if I make a bad burger today.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.700
- Coming through.
- Let's go!

19:21.035 --> 19:23.995
Big push. There's one
winning burger coming out
of this kitchen today.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.288
All: Yes, chef.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.041
Let's work, guys!
Let's get it, baby!
Let's get it!

19:29.085 --> 19:31.752
If I put this burger
on my brioche bun,

19:31.796 --> 19:34.046
that juice gonna
eat through this,

19:34.090 --> 19:35.631
and they're gonna have
a soggy burger.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.342
I'm going to take
these potatoes, build a bed,

19:38.386 --> 19:41.137
so the juices
don't soak straight
into my bottom bun.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.889
Gordon: Six minutes to go!

19:42.932 --> 19:45.057
Your burger, girl,
you've got six minutes
to get that done.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.225
In we go.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.811
<i> It's very easy</i>
<i> to underestimate a burger,</i>

19:48.855 --> 19:51.522
and it's one
of the biggest staples
on any menu across america.

19:51.524 --> 19:56.235
<i> I think my team severely</i>
<i> has underestimated</i>
<i> these burgers.</i>

19:56.279 --> 19:59.071
<i> They have got to step it up</i>
<i> and fast.</i>

19:59.115 --> 20:00.489
I got somebody's fries
right here.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.118
Kenny, look at me!
Your burger needs to go on.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.370
- Heard, chef. Heard.
- And stop messing around
with the garnish

20:06.414 --> 20:09.540
and get the burger on now!
Right now.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.334
- Don't do this to me.
- I hear you, chef.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.919
You get so wound up
doing the prep.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.212
- Focus on the burger.
- I hear you, chef.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.506
Oil in there. If anyone's
burger's undercooked,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.342
you keep that on there
till the last second, yes?

20:19.385 --> 20:22.386
- All: Yes, chef.
- Let's go. Devonnie, wake up.
Let's go.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.556
Okay, you got olive oil
on there?

20:25.600 --> 20:26.766
Uh, no, I don't.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.893
Olive oil. Greek.
Tell me the story.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.311
- Yes, yes!
- Two minutes! It's go-time!

20:30.730 --> 20:31.387
Aren't you gonna do anything
with the bun? You're just
going to leave it?

20:32.056 --> 20:32.813
No, no, I'm about to put
butter on there and put it on.

20:33.816 --> 20:37.568
Yes, yes.
The best thing that happened was
you went to that elimination

20:37.612 --> 20:39.403
and you've come back
ten times stronger.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.115
- Thank you, chef.
- Platform's coming down.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.575
Platform is here, guys.
Let's go.

20:44.619 --> 20:48.162
- Kenny: Let's go, guys!
- Gordon: Ten, nine, eight.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.998
Devonnie, please!
Six, five.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.084
- Devonnie!
- Kenny: Come on, dev.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.670
Three. Get it on! One.

20:55.713 --> 20:58.256
Get it on!
Get it on, please!

20:58.299 --> 21:00.633
- Kenny: Get it on there!
- Please, please, please!

21:00.718 --> 21:02.426
( bleep )

21:05.390 --> 21:07.014
platform is here, guys.
Let's go.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.016
- Get it on!
- Get it on there.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.769
Please, please,
please, please!

21:11.813 --> 21:13.312
- Man!
- ( bleep )

21:13.356 --> 21:15.690
nyesha: Platform's here, guys.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.276
Oh, ( bleep ).

21:18.319 --> 21:23.489
Come on, zach.
Five, four, three, two, one.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.409
- Yes.
- Good job, guys. Good job.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.995
- Your platform has arrived.
- ( bleep )

21:29.080 --> 21:31.330
- let's go.
Move, move, move.
- ( bleep )

21:31.332 --> 21:33.416
be careful when you walk
those over to the platform.

21:33.418 --> 21:38.462
Five, four, three, two, one.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.256
Okay, last looks.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.591
- Whoo!
- ( bleep )

21:42.593 --> 21:44.343
oh, my god.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.054
- I'm so proud of you.
- ( overlapping chatter )

21:47.098 --> 21:49.098
tricia:
<i> The basement sucks.</i>

21:50.268 --> 21:53.561
I hope my burger's cooked.
It looked cooked.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.698
Wow. That was a tough,
tough challenge.

22:07.201 --> 22:10.619
And we started off this morning
with an inspirational taste

22:10.663 --> 22:12.204
with some really good burgers.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.539
I think each and every one
of you can see

22:13.583 --> 22:17.543
how personal this is
for the mentors, right?

22:17.587 --> 22:18.336
Right, shall we taste?

22:18.379 --> 22:19.420
- Yes.
- Yes, chef.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.589
Richard, let's start
with you, please.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.924
Richard: This chef has a very
clear theme to this burger.

22:23.968 --> 22:29.263
It's a southern inspired
spiced chicken burger
with pimento cheese

22:29.307 --> 22:32.391
and a peach
and horseradish ketchup

22:32.435 --> 22:34.977
with some fried sweet potatoes.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.521
Nyesha:
Stunning flavors.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.023
I'm getting really beautiful
charred notes

22:39.067 --> 22:40.191
coming off of this burger.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.817
Gordon: Choosing chicken
on the top floor

22:41.861 --> 22:45.654
with all those
top flight proteins
is a risky choice.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.198
But, my god, it delivers.

22:47.241 --> 22:50.159
Oh, thank you, lord.
So worried.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.453
Our next chef has made

22:52.497 --> 22:56.248
an absolute classic rendition
of a burger.

22:56.292 --> 22:59.794
Whoever cooked that on your team
is a professional chef,
let's get that right.

22:59.796 --> 23:03.756
So this is sirloin,
pretzel bun, fried egg,

23:03.800 --> 23:05.508
a special jalapeno sauce.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.969
The potatoes are cooked amazing
and a really lovely side.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.347
For me, it tastes
as good as it looks.

23:11.432 --> 23:15.184
Wow. My heart is smiling.

23:15.228 --> 23:19.647
Especially after cooking
in the elimination round,
it's the best feeling.

23:19.649 --> 23:23.984
Our next chef, this is
a greek inspired lamb burger

23:24.028 --> 23:26.404
with an oregano lemon aioli.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.073
The actual lamb's delicious.
Pâté is delicious.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.535
Bread is disgusting.

23:32.578 --> 23:36.330
I would love to have seen
some greens on this plate.

23:36.374 --> 23:38.165
All right, our next burger.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.084
You've heard
of a smashed burger.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.919
Smashed? Where's the bun?
Where's the bread?

23:41.963 --> 23:46.424
Man, that is the most
unappetizing burger
I've seen in a long time.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.466
That's raw.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.262
( spits )

23:52.765 --> 23:54.682
( bleep )

23:56.352 --> 23:57.643
yeah.

23:58.646 --> 23:59.728
I can't swallow that.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.981
I'll lose
my third star michelin.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.816
If chef ramsay
ever spit my food out,

24:03.901 --> 24:08.404
I would just walk out
and go dig my grave
and lay in it.

24:08.406 --> 24:11.449
Kind of a remarkable achievement
to be able to burn something

24:11.492 --> 24:13.075
and keep it raw
at the same time.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.452
That's harsh.

24:14.495 --> 24:17.288
<i> I need mariah or courtney's</i>
<i> burger to win this</i>

24:17.331 --> 24:18.122
to keep me out of elimination,

24:18.374 --> 24:21.625
because I am for sure
headed there

24:21.627 --> 24:23.085
if we don't win today.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.837
Right. Basement.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.631
I think one
of the most difficult proteins
on that platform,

24:27.675 --> 24:29.216
this is an ostrich burger.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.010
I mean, where'd you get
calamari from? There's squid.

24:31.053 --> 24:34.597
- No. They're leeks.
- I wanna do a vegetarian
calamari dish now

24:34.640 --> 24:35.973
because of that.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.391
Where were the potatoes
used in this dish?

24:37.393 --> 24:39.226
I thought the fries
were forgotten. They weren't.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.770
Unfortunately,
the fries are on there.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.189
Nyesha: The burger itself,

24:43.232 --> 24:44.732
seasoned nicely
in terms of salt,

24:44.775 --> 24:47.443
- but lacking depth of flavor.
- It's missing a condiment.

24:47.487 --> 24:50.821
I'm not getting anything to take
this dish to the next level.

24:50.865 --> 24:54.283
This one was a bit
of a chef's dream.
This is a dry aged.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.160
I'm amazed it hit the basement.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.954
So we start off with a bacon jam
and fried tomatoes.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.041
Look at that. Wow.

25:02.084 --> 25:05.044
The cook is superb. Bingo.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.004
- Mmm, mmm.
- Oh, boy.

25:07.048 --> 25:10.007
This is a pork based burger.

25:10.051 --> 25:13.886
It has fried
crispy avocado chips

25:13.921 --> 25:17.806
with a crisp from
a purple potato as well
and a pickled cucumber.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.392
The combination
of the cucumber and the avocado
are very tasty.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.353
The burger and the bun,
not very good at all.

25:22.396 --> 25:25.189
I've seen this individual cook
brilliantly in this competition,

25:25.233 --> 25:27.525
but when you have a garnish
of a deep fried avocado

25:27.568 --> 25:29.485
that tastes better
than your burger,
we're in trouble, period.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.029
Well, at least the garnish
tastes good.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.658
This is a turkey burger
with a mango salsa.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.787
( bleep )

25:39.789 --> 25:41.413
that's raw.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.957
I'm so sorry.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.751
Just professionally, I can't ask
either of you to taste that.

25:48.256 --> 25:51.257
Gordon:<i> For me,</i>
<i> I'm slightly pissed off,</i>
<i> because we are strong.</i>

25:51.259 --> 25:52.132
<i> We're super strong.</i>

25:52.134 --> 25:55.469
And we still put up raw burgers.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.012
That is an insult.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.347
Right, shall we move
to the middle floor?

25:58.474 --> 26:03.352
Okay, first up, we have
a milwaukee inspired burger.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.437
Deep fried
cheese down the center,

26:05.439 --> 26:08.524
crispy bacon,
and smashed potatoes
on the side.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.317
There's more cheese on there
than there is burger.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.987
Well, I mean, we're probably
gonna have a heart attack,

26:13.030 --> 26:15.864
but it looks good.

26:15.866 --> 26:16.657
Is the portion of the cheese

26:16.867 --> 26:18.158
a little too much
for the burger?

26:18.160 --> 26:20.452
I'm gonna say yes,

26:20.496 --> 26:22.413
but the flavor overrides
all of those negatives.

26:22.456 --> 26:25.332
Next up,
we have an elk burger.

26:25.376 --> 26:29.169
Anyone picking up this protein,
honestly, deserves to get
to the next level.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.547
Like the bison, the ostrich,
it's the one they all run
a mile away from.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.799
So, if this tastes
as good as it looks...

26:33.801 --> 26:38.053
The potatoes
were shaved thin enough,
and they're beautiful.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.430
- That is delicious.
- Wow.

26:39.473 --> 26:42.725
Man, what's going on
with your floor?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.686
They brought it today, chef.
They were working with intention
the entire time.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.062
Really proud.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.190
♪ happy burger dance,
happy burger dance ♪

26:50.234 --> 26:53.360
this bison burger is a play
on a juicy lucy,

26:53.404 --> 26:55.988
so this burger is stuffed
with pimento cheese.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.073
They forgot the bun?
Or they--

26:58.117 --> 27:00.159
unfortunately, the chef
did forget the bun.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.995
This is such a tragedy.
I'll to explain why.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.246
It actually tastes delicious.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.332
You just need
to be blind to eat it.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.376
I'd rather that
than it looks beautiful

27:09.420 --> 27:12.087
but you need to have
no taste buds to eat it.

27:12.131 --> 27:16.133
- So here we have
a wagyu short rib burger.
- Wow.

27:16.177 --> 27:20.220
And then made a barbeque sauce
this is called wojapi.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.723
There's more juice in there
than j. Lo's butt.

27:22.725 --> 27:25.392
- Oh!
- Wow.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.230
Here's the upsetting news.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.274
This is a wagyu burger,

27:32.318 --> 27:34.401
and the big issue for me
across this

27:34.445 --> 27:36.278
is that this person's
not on my team.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.573
There's no chef
in america tonight

27:39.617 --> 27:43.035
who can beat the temperature,
the flavor,

27:43.079 --> 27:45.287
and then the heritage
coming into that.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.039
Richard:
I mean, millions of people,
including myself,

27:47.083 --> 27:48.666
are running
to the keyboard right now

27:48.709 --> 27:51.585
figuring out what wojapi is.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.837
That is next level.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.089
Pyet:<i> This morning I woke up,</i>

27:55.132 --> 27:56.215
<i> and the first thing</i>
<i> I told myself is,</i>

27:56.300 --> 27:58.092
<i> "we're not playing it</i>
<i> safe anymore."</i>

27:58.094 --> 28:00.219
I actually wanted to bring forth

28:00.262 --> 28:01.720
a little bit more today

28:01.722 --> 28:05.140
and take
a little bit more of a risk.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.767
<i> And I did that today.</i>

28:06.811 --> 28:08.560
I'm on
an emotional rollercoaster.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.440
Your floor was on fire,
and mine was on fire literally.

28:13.484 --> 28:17.027
A different type of fire.
Some highs and lows, all of you.

28:17.071 --> 28:20.656
Right now we need some
very serious time on our own.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.491
Excuse us.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.076
I'm not too sure
whether that was nyesha

28:24.537 --> 28:28.163
cooking those burgers
on that middle floor,
because they were immaculate.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.499
And personally,
we got our ass kicked.

28:30.501 --> 28:33.001
Some disasters in both yours
and my kitchen.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.379
Yeah, I mean,
we have one dish that's so bad,

28:35.423 --> 28:38.549
this chef is gonna be lucky
to be cooking again
even in the elimination.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.259
- Wow.
- Honestly, richard, I think we
have more than one of those.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.970
It's all good.
Don't worry about that.

28:43.013 --> 28:46.181
Don't think about
what you're gonna make.
We're not there yet.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.516
- Some amazing highs,
I mean, incredible highs.
- Yes.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.059
- Really, really.
- Definitely.

28:49.061 --> 28:53.439
I am blown away.
That last wagyu? Off the charts.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.025
One of the best burgers
of the night, richard,
was the sirloin.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.528
I mean, for me, that definitely
is the most cohesive,

28:59.572 --> 29:00.988
well thought out burger.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.406
- Shall we?
- Yes, thank you.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.366
Of course, I don't wanna lose
anyone from my team.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.368
Neither does gordon or nyesha.

29:06.454 --> 29:10.289
But at the end of the day,
we are looking for the one
next level chef

29:10.291 --> 29:12.708
regardless of what team
they're playing for.

29:12.752 --> 29:17.129
This was a tough choice

29:17.173 --> 29:20.549
because we did some
great burgers tonight.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.510
And the winning burger
of the night...

29:26.223 --> 29:27.431
Is...

29:35.149 --> 29:36.565
The winning burger
of the night..

29:40.529 --> 29:41.361
Is...

29:43.449 --> 29:44.323
The wagyu.

29:44.358 --> 29:46.325
Congratulations, team nyesha.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.412
My heart can't take it.
My heart is exploding.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.040
Oh, my god. You did it.
I knew it, pyet.

29:53.042 --> 29:56.084
There's been
a lot of conversation
about native-americans,

29:56.128 --> 29:58.420
<i> there not being a seat</i>
<i> at the table for them,</i>

29:58.464 --> 30:01.173
but tonight
we conquered the table.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.925
Congratulations,
you are all safe.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.218
Young lady, how do you feel?

30:04.261 --> 30:06.178
I feel extremely proud

30:06.222 --> 30:08.305
to bring my heritage
to the forefront,

30:08.307 --> 30:12.059
and I know my ancestors are--
they're singing.

30:13.187 --> 30:17.731
Unfortunately,
for the not so good news...

30:19.109 --> 30:23.320
Gordon and richard both
have to nominate one dish

30:23.364 --> 30:25.489
to go into
the elimination tonight.

30:27.076 --> 30:30.285
My team was literally on fire,
way out of control.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.288
<i> We put up three dishes</i>
<i> that are dreadful.</i>

30:33.332 --> 30:35.958
<i> I know the chef</i>
<i> I'm sending into</i>
<i> the elimination</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:39.086
<i> has what it takes to pull off</i>
<i> a better dish</i>

30:39.129 --> 30:40.963
<i> and come back strong.</i>

30:41.006 --> 30:43.674
The dish I'm nominating
is simple.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.260
Devonnie's turkey burger.

30:46.262 --> 30:51.139
It's raw, and it's miles away
from anything servable.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.267
Devonnie:
<i> I don't wanna go home.</i>
<i> I'm not ready to go home.</i>

30:53.269 --> 30:56.228
<i> But I get why I'm going</i>
<i> into the elimination.</i>

30:56.230 --> 31:00.315
I have my baby,
I have people who love me

31:00.359 --> 31:02.025
that I know are cheering me on,

31:02.069 --> 31:04.069
and I'm not ready
to disappoint them.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.280
<i> So I'm ready to bring it.</i>

31:06.323 --> 31:09.324
Today I'm gonna put up
our worst dish of the day.

31:09.410 --> 31:12.369
This dish was burnt,
this dish was raw,

31:12.413 --> 31:15.497
this chef has
a lot to prove to me.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.166
I have one chef
who's on a downward slide,

31:18.168 --> 31:20.168
<i> and I've seen</i>
<i> with one of our other chefs</i>

31:20.170 --> 31:22.004
<i> that if you win</i>
<i> an elimination,</i>

31:22.006 --> 31:23.505
it really can put some wind
in your sail,

31:23.549 --> 31:26.008
so I'm hoping that does that
for this chef.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.635
I'm sending up against devonnie,
chef jonathan.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.387
Yeah.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.391
Devonnie, jonathan,
say goodbye to your teams.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.184
Everyone else,
head to the top floor

31:36.186 --> 31:38.353
- and we'll meet you there.
- Hey, let's go.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.314
Jonathan:
<i> I've had to fight a lot in</i>
<i> my life for people's respect.</i>

31:40.357 --> 31:42.357
I was the kid
who liked to cook.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.151
I was the kid who liked to sing.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.235
<i> And that wasn't always easy,</i>

31:45.279 --> 31:47.905
but it's given me
a lot of fight,

31:47.948 --> 31:48.906
and I'm willing to fight
to stay here.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.491
Both of you,
we're gonna give you a chance

31:51.535 --> 31:56.705
at one of the most difficult
dishes on the burger menu today.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.833
An ahi tuna burger

31:59.835 --> 32:03.503
with slaw
and a side of onion rings.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.380
Devonnie, I've seen you
cook brilliantly.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.090
- Remember who you are.
- Yes, chef.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.009
- You can do this, right?
- I can, chef.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.303
Jonathan, take a deep breath,

32:11.305 --> 32:13.555
and just go up there
and cook a delicious dish.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.265
I'll see you upstairs.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.185
- Thank you, chef.
- Devonnie, good luck.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.020
- Thank you, chef.
- Good luck, jonathan.

32:20.064 --> 32:21.521
- Thank you, chef.
- Yes, chef.

32:26.820 --> 32:29.529
Whatever happens, we both
have done so well to be here

32:29.573 --> 32:31.281
- to even get this far.
- Yeah. Truly, truly, truly.

32:31.367 --> 32:34.284
So many people
have already left,
and we're still here.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.452
Yeah, yeah.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.287
I guess I shouldn't be
as nervous

32:37.331 --> 32:39.081
because jonathan
is also a home chef,

32:39.124 --> 32:41.500
<i> but he has been coming</i>
<i> out the gate strong.</i>

32:43.462 --> 32:46.421
<i> And he knows his way</i>
<i> around any ingredient</i>
<i> you throw at him.</i>

32:46.423 --> 32:49.716
But I want this. I'm not gonna
make it easy for him.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.968
$250,000 is at stake,

32:51.053 --> 32:53.553
<i> and then the mentorship</i>
<i> that goes with that.</i>

32:53.555 --> 32:56.390
I'm gonna do my best
to whoop some ass.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.393
- You got this. Let's work it.
- Yeah, you do too.

33:02.022 --> 33:05.983
Your 30 minutes starts now!

33:06.026 --> 33:08.568
- Go!
- ( muttering )

33:08.612 --> 33:12.114
remember, guys,
this is an ahi tuna burger.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.783
A beautiful slaw,
a beautiful onion ring, yes?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.201
- Yes, chef.
- Jonathan: Yes.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.413
So the tricky thing
about ahi tuna is that
you can eat it raw.

33:19.456 --> 33:22.666
You wanna get a very hard sear
on the outside

33:22.710 --> 33:24.251
but keep the middle raw,

33:24.294 --> 33:26.128
and that can be difficult.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.587
So what are you thinking
about here, jonathan?

33:27.965 --> 33:33.176
I'm going to be doing
a red cabbage serrano
yellow pepper slaw.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.262
Awesome. How are we bringing
acid into your slaw?

33:35.305 --> 33:38.306
We are going use lime juice,
and maybe some lemon
from over there.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.683
That's what
you're looking at. Yup.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.059
- How we feeling, chef?
- Good, chef.

33:41.186 --> 33:45.147
- Good. What's the plan?
- I'm gonna make a sesame seed

33:45.149 --> 33:47.482
encrusted ahi tuna burger

33:47.526 --> 33:49.401
with a brown sugar soy
chili glaze.

33:49.445 --> 33:53.739
- Beautiful.
- And some pickled cucumber
and carrots for my slaw.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.408
It's super important to cut
the right thickness of the fish

33:56.452 --> 33:58.910
<i> because you don't want it</i>
<i> to be cold in the middle.</i>

33:58.954 --> 34:02.539
And this cooks very quickly
because you don't want
to overcook the fish.

34:02.583 --> 34:08.503
I would cut two steaks
an inch and a half thick
so you can sear on each side.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.548
An inch and a half.
Inch and a half.
Use your finger.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.884
You have the notches
in your finger.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.218
- Smaller.
- Ooh, that's big.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.797
Slice your slaw a little thinner
or find you a mandoline.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.182
Right.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.349
- Reuel: Fish sauce?
- Yeah, fish sauce.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.225
Fish sauce,
you could add a little bit.

34:22.519 --> 34:25.062
- It has salt to it too, right?
- Got it.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.105
That's a big umami boost.
That's it.

34:27.149 --> 34:28.732
- Devonnie,
cook your dish, okay?
- Yes, chef.

34:29.151 --> 34:32.944
That wonderful yellow mustard
that's in the back of you,
rub it on your tuna.

34:32.946 --> 34:36.573
Take a little bit,
and you're just gonna put
a little crust on it

34:36.617 --> 34:37.866
just to rub it.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.076
Here's the deal, right?

34:39.369 --> 34:42.412
<i> Devonnie's receiving a lot</i>
<i> of feedback from her team.</i>

34:42.456 --> 34:44.831
<i> In terms of driving her dish,</i>
<i> you know, did she really want</i>

34:44.833 --> 34:47.918
<i> to put yellow mustard</i>
<i> on her tuna? I'm not so sure.</i>

34:47.961 --> 34:51.254
- No, I gotta that.
- Devonnie, just remember,
this is your dish.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.256
- Yes, chef.
- This is your team, right?

34:53.300 --> 34:55.133
But we want to see
your personality in this dish.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.135
Absolutely, chef.
It'll come through
in my flavors.

34:57.179 --> 35:00.347
I believe you.
Ten minutes down, guys!
Ten minutes down.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.391
Move your knives.
Ooh, please be careful.
Thank you.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.936
Nyesha: Working fast,
but working efficient, right?
Working clean.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.312
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

35:07.564 --> 35:10.065
- Yes, chef.
- Please be careful, right?
Working, working.

35:10.109 --> 35:13.068
- I'm so sorry, chef.
- Intention, focus.
Breathe through your nose.

35:14.988 --> 35:18.115
- Chill the hell out.
- Yeah, just leave him alone.
He's getting frustrated.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.326
Just leave him alone.
Jonathan is just shaking.

35:21.411 --> 35:24.162
His nerves were shot before
he was even in this elimination,

35:24.206 --> 35:26.164
<i> and now he's just</i>
<i> all over the place.</i>

35:26.208 --> 35:29.292
This is gonna just rip apart his
chance to win this challenge.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.211
Please be careful
of your fingers.

35:31.255 --> 35:32.337
Mariah: You doing good!
You got your slaw going.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.923
- You're doing amazing.
- You got your aioli going.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.092
- You're making good time.
- We still got to make
onion rings though.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.052
- Organize yourself.
- We still got to-- god.

35:39.096 --> 35:41.555
- Nyesha: You okay?
- Medic! Medic! Medic!

35:41.598 --> 35:43.014
Jonathan: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Just let me get...

35:43.058 --> 35:44.599
Put your hand up.

35:44.601 --> 35:49.521
Jon doesn't cut himself.
Jon cuts himself.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.022
Stop the clock!

35:51.066 --> 35:53.358
- Medic.
- Medic!

35:53.402 --> 35:54.860
Go. Just go.

35:54.903 --> 35:58.572
He is dripping blood, and
I'm thinking he needs stitches.

35:58.574 --> 36:02.159
He's pretty bloody.
Medic is on his way, jonathan.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.207
( muted chatter )

36:09.251 --> 36:12.043
it's my thumb.
Have we stopped time?

36:12.087 --> 36:14.713
- Yes, stopped time.
You're good.
- Okay.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.340
Devonnie, just one moment, okay?

36:17.384 --> 36:19.467
Just breathe for a second.
Just hold off for one second.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.845
- Okay.
- We're just gonna
patch this up.

36:21.889 --> 36:25.599
I gotta calm my ass down
in the kitchen, period.
Not a question about it.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.935
<i> You know, it would behoove me</i>
<i> to slow down a little bit</i>

36:28.979 --> 36:31.188
or else I'm probably
not gonna have any fingers
by the time it's all over.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.773
Back to your stations.
Don't touch anything yet.

36:33.775 --> 36:35.984
There are ten minutes left.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.445
Ready? Start now.

36:38.447 --> 36:41.740
You are done.
You are done. Okay.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.201
Good mise en place.
I like how you're setting things
to the side.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.120
There you go.

36:47.164 --> 36:50.540
The judges need to taste
how badly I want to be here.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.834
Don't forget about
your onion rings in the fryer!

36:52.878 --> 36:54.377
- How we looking on those?
- They're good.
I just looked. You're good.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.256
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Toss you veggies. Taste.
Make sure your flavor's there.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.717
- Happy?
- A little salt.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.261
It's really challenging actually
seeing jonathan and devonnie

37:03.263 --> 37:04.721
because when I look a jonathan,

37:05.057 --> 37:08.558
<i> I always see</i>
<i> that swiss chard gratin</i>
<i> from his steak challenge.</i>

37:08.644 --> 37:12.062
And with devonnie,
she puts her whole soul
into everything she does.

37:12.105 --> 37:16.066
So it's really hard
to see these two sweet angels
cook against each other today.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.318
Let's watch these sesame seeds.

37:18.779 --> 37:22.489
I'm concerned about
the sesame seeds because
he's gonna double cook them.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.407
- He's gonna double cook them.
- Start with some fresh ones?

37:24.409 --> 37:27.494
- Nyesha: Focus, jonathan.
- Tuna! Tuna out.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.746
- Tuna out, baby.
- Tuna out. Tuna!

37:29.790 --> 37:32.073
Okay, guys, start plating!

37:32.084 --> 37:34.292
Two minutes left.
Start plating.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.169
- Slaw on top.
- All: Yes.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.420
Pyet: Beautiful color.

37:37.714 --> 37:41.424
- Take those big ass pieces
of the cabbage off.
- Yeah.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.260
- Make your plate is clean,
chef, okay?
- Yes, chef.

37:43.303 --> 37:46.429
- This is "next level chef,
do you understand?
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.808
You've got one of
the greatest chefs in the world
trying to help you.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.269
You're trying to tune
everybody else out
to listen to her.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.354
<i> You're just buzzing so hard</i>
<i> in your head</i>

37:54.398 --> 37:56.189
trying to make sure
you're getting everything done.

37:56.233 --> 37:58.775
Good job, both of you.
He would be proud.

37:58.819 --> 37:59.776
- ( bleep )
- let's go!

38:00.070 --> 38:02.487
- Good job. Good job.
- Let's go, jonathan!

38:02.531 --> 38:05.615
- Put it on there.
Put it on there.
- Three, two, one!

38:05.617 --> 38:07.742
- Stop cooking.
- Boom. Good work, chef.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.536
- Good job!
- Here, man.

38:09.538 --> 38:13.456
- Good job. Good job.
Good job, chef.
- Thank you, chef.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.334
I put my very best
on that plate,

38:16.378 --> 38:19.129
everything I'm made of,
everything I love.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.214
All I can do is leave
my heart on that plate.

38:21.249 --> 38:23.091
- Thank you for your help.
- Yeah, no problem, sir.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.135
I wanna stay
in this competition
so bad it hurts

38:25.178 --> 38:28.221
<i> because this is the avenue</i>
<i> to which I'm gonna be able</i>

38:28.265 --> 38:29.723
<i> to get to do</i>
<i> what I want to do every day.</i>

38:29.766 --> 38:31.558
I don't want it to end.

38:33.145 --> 38:36.354
- Right, nyesha, how was that?
- Gordon, richard.

38:36.398 --> 38:40.317
It's so hard to pick a chef
to send into the elimination,

38:40.360 --> 38:42.444
<i> and by doing</i>
<i> these tastings blind,</i>

38:42.487 --> 38:44.195
<i> my back is against the wall</i>

38:44.239 --> 38:46.281
<i> if jonathan didn't pull off</i>
<i> the better dish.</i>

38:46.283 --> 38:47.449
<i> But the bottom line is</i>

38:47.784 --> 38:50.577
if a chef doesn't perform
in an elimination, that's it.

38:50.620 --> 38:53.788
-<i> Game over. </i>
- Very intense.
They both battled it out.

38:53.832 --> 38:58.376
We have two ahi
sesame crusted burgers,
onion rings, and slaw.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.046
On the right,
we have lightly pickled
vegetables

39:01.089 --> 39:04.299
with a pickled ginger
as well as sweet chili aioli.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.510
On the left,
it has sliced avocado,

39:07.554 --> 39:11.765
and this has a red cabbage slaw
with a ginger aioli.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.978
Moment of truth here.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.943
Okay, so nothing wrong
when you see rare tuna.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.653
The question is,
is it ice cold?

39:30.327 --> 39:32.285
The actual tuna
is cooked beautifully.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.412
The right amount of seasoning
is on there.

39:34.456 --> 39:38.333
Onion rings nice and crispy,
slaw works well,

39:38.377 --> 39:41.169
but it's just too much tuna.

39:41.213 --> 39:44.255
It's almost too thick
for the bread.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.257
Richard: It still needs
a little bit more sauce though,

39:46.301 --> 39:49.135
and I don't see
that layer of sauce.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.139
So this one here,
strange color,

39:53.141 --> 39:55.016
but again,
it's all in the flavor.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.143
And how does that taste?

39:59.147 --> 40:00.438
- Richard: Okay.
- Yeah?

40:00.440 --> 40:01.648
- Mm-hmm.
- Beautifully done.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.691
Whew.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.486
<i> Eliminations are very tough</i>

40:06.530 --> 40:08.571
because I don't want to lose
anybody I've mentored.

40:08.615 --> 40:12.409
<i> I just hope the burger</i>
<i> that impresses us the most</i>
<i> is devonnie's.</i>

40:12.452 --> 40:15.161
<i> Honestly,</i>
<i> I can't afford to lose</i>
<i> another team member.</i>

40:15.163 --> 40:18.164
This one for me is not as dense.

40:18.208 --> 40:21.209
Richard: The onion rings
are seasoned so perfectly.

40:21.211 --> 40:24.254
I'm not a big fan
on the rough cuts
when you're negotiating

40:24.297 --> 40:26.589
big, heavy, thick slices
of red cabbage.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.675
I don't even know
if I can call that slaw.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.929
So both tunas
are nailed beautifully.

40:32.973 --> 40:35.473
We're nitpicking,
and it's gonna come down
to the finest detail.

40:35.517 --> 40:38.101
So this is a tough one.
Richard, please.

40:38.145 --> 40:40.478
My favorite tuna burger

40:40.480 --> 40:42.439
is the one
with the avocado over here.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.357
Wow.

40:44.401 --> 40:46.693
I'm gonna go over
for the ahi tuna burger

40:46.736 --> 40:49.446
that is the most delicious.

40:49.489 --> 40:50.697
And that burger...

40:55.078 --> 40:58.455
...Is the one with avocado.
Who is that?

40:58.498 --> 41:00.957
- Nyesha:
That's jonathan's burger.
- Jonathan.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.294
Whew.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.629
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.797
Well done.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.132
Thank you so much.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.842
I'm elated that
they chose my food, you know?

41:10.886 --> 41:15.013
I'm feeling good.
And then it hits you
that devonnie's leaving.

41:15.056 --> 41:16.556
Gordon:
I'm sorry, devonnie.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.225
Young lady, let me tell you
something really important.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.312
You cook with a lot of passion.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.981
You've got incredible talent.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.941
Thank you, chef.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.110
Say goodbye to your team.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.155
- Thanks, guys.
- So sorry.

41:33.950 --> 41:37.702
I really thought I had it
because I put my soul
on this plate.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.122
I knew what I was cooking for.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.374
I know what this means,
I know what's at stake,

41:43.418 --> 41:45.752
and I left everything
on that plate.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.337
- ( cheering )
-<i> I put it there.</i>

41:52.719 --> 41:54.219
All of you, listen carefully.

41:54.304 --> 41:55.303
These decisions
are getting tougher.

41:55.347 --> 41:56.596
Stay out of elimination.

41:56.932 --> 42:01.309
- Learn from
other people's mistakes.
- I feel for devonnie.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.478
<i> Even though it's her hands,</i>
<i> her decisions,</i>

42:03.480 --> 42:05.188
<i> I just felt like</i>
<i> I let her down.</i>

42:05.232 --> 42:07.357
And now
we're just down to three,

42:07.359 --> 42:10.610
<i> which means our probability</i>
<i> of putting up a good dish</i>

42:10.612 --> 42:12.320
is now less than everybody's.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.156
<i> Moving forward,</i>
<i> stakes are way higher.</i>

42:15.200 --> 42:17.116
Now get some rest,

42:17.160 --> 42:19.285
because the next time
we see you,

42:19.287 --> 42:21.162
we're all going up a level.

42:21.164 --> 42:23.039
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.040
- Good night.
- Thank you for your kindness.

42:24.084 --> 42:25.250
- Good job.
- Thank you so much.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.126
- Thank you, chefs.
- Thank you, chefs.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.337
Oh, my god, jonathan.

42:29.381 --> 42:30.421
( sighs )

42:30.465 --> 42:33.550
that's my boy!
You're my boy!

42:33.593 --> 42:35.301
( laughs )

42:37.055 --> 42:39.013
<i> this Sunday on</i>
<i> an all-new episode...</i>

42:39.015 --> 42:42.058
Today's challenge,
a next level brunch dish.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.894
Brunch is not my forte. Aah!

42:44.938 --> 42:46.229
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I messed this one up.

42:46.690 --> 42:50.400
I'm gonna have to summon
every angel I know
to get me through this.

42:50.443 --> 42:53.069
- Gordon: I am done losing.
- Today is war.

42:53.113 --> 42:55.530
Nobody going home.
I'm getting dirty to win.

42:55.532 --> 42:58.950
Chef arrington
seems highly unsure
about what I'm doing.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.452
- Gotta hope that works out.
- Oh, my god!

43:01.538 --> 43:04.581
- One of my chefs did
not make the platform.
- How is that possible?

43:04.666 --> 43:07.125
This individual
shot themselves in the foot.
