- I need a sample.

some advance notice next time?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.092

Was claiming some useless skin
care cream changed her life,

09:56.063 --> 09:58.363
Gave her financial independence.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.065

for a side hustle,

- I don't know,
I just listened, I guess.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.473
It was pretty easy,
to be honest.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.675
- Easy? (laughs)
- yeah.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.412
- You think anyone can do this?
- No. But...

16:54.481 --> 16:56.346
Maybe I can.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.183
- Do you know how many hours
I had to put in to do this?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.118
I went to medical school, I...

17:01.254 --> 17:03.154
Cut open cadavers.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.857
- To be a therapist?

17:05.859 --> 17:07.458
You didn't think
to question that?

17:07.593 --> 17:09.260

You can help by answering
phones, uh,

Keeping your mouth shut.
Got it?

17:18.271 --> 17:19.804
- Why?

17:19.873 --> 17:22.540
Are you scared that I'm gonna
become a better psychiatrist

17:22.542 --> 17:24.341

18:12.625 --> 18:14.458
In the podeski family
for generations,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.327
We should probably insure it

it's sterling?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.279

it's sterling.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.215
- What is its provenance?
- Um... England?

18:38.217 --> 18:39.650
- Well, that's impossible.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.420
These markings are distinctly
germanic.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.955

actually?

18:45.024 --> 18:46.757
- Why? Wouldn't you want
to make sure something

18:46.826 --> 18:49.092
So valuable is properly
cared for?

18:49.129 --> 18:51.295
Unless it's not valuable.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.597
- Now, kate,
let's not be hasty.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.033
Maybe this is that special
kind of silver

18:56.102 --> 18:57.568
That's so rare and expensive

18:57.703 --> 18:59.303
It actually looks like a cheap
piece of shit.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.905

Honey, I'm... I'm not trying
to replace her.

when she chose your dad

She knew I was part
of the package.

If I got her sign-off,

19:49.923 --> 19:51.288
Do you think I can get yours?

What if I throw in a new frog
to sweeten the pot?
