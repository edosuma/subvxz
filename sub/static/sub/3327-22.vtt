ANNOUNCER: <i>Previously on</i> Elementary:
Several weeks ago,

00:05.735 --> 00:07.034
<i>he learned of the existence</i>

00:07.036 --> 00:08.685
<i>of a woman named Irene Adler.</i>

00:08.687 --> 00:10.855
<i>He's only loved</i>
<i>one person in his life,</i>

00:10.857 --> 00:12.740
as far as I can tell,
and she was murdered.

00:12.742 --> 00:15.493
Your girl, that was him.

00:15.495 --> 00:18.245
That was Moriarty.

00:18.247 --> 00:20.214
And whom do I have the
pleasure of speaking to?

00:20.216 --> 00:22.249
My name is Moriarty.

00:22.251 --> 00:25.920
I believe we're overdue
for a chat.

00:25.922 --> 00:29.723
Well, if this is Moriarty,
then, yeah, long overdue.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.342
If?

00:31.344 --> 00:33.210
You're just a voice on
the end of a telephone.

00:33.212 --> 00:35.262
I don't even know if
you have a first name.

00:35.264 --> 00:37.064
Mind telling me
your first name?

00:37.066 --> 00:38.849
I appreciate your

00:38.851 --> 00:42.219
passing my message along
to Sebastian Moran.

00:42.221 --> 00:44.888
I hear his prognosis
is quite grave.

00:44.890 --> 00:46.073
So what?

00:46.075 --> 00:47.858
I expect you to feel angry

00:47.860 --> 00:49.560
because I manipulated you.

00:49.562 --> 00:51.612
Rather easily, I might add.

00:51.614 --> 00:53.163
Chin up, Holmes.

00:53.165 --> 00:54.865
Manipulation is my business.

00:54.867 --> 00:57.568
Seems more like murder
is your business.

00:57.570 --> 01:00.037
A part of it.

01:00.039 --> 01:02.089
Explain.

01:02.091 --> 01:04.090
Consider me a spider.

01:04.093 --> 01:05.793
I sit motionless

01:05.795 --> 01:07.478
at the center of my web.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.079
That web has
a thousand radiatis,

01:09.081 --> 01:11.849
and I know well every
quiver of each of them.

01:11.851 --> 01:14.351
I do little myself,
I only plan.

01:14.353 --> 01:18.255
But my agents are numerous
and splendidly organized.

01:18.257 --> 01:19.974
If there is a crime to be done,

01:19.976 --> 01:22.226
a paper to be abstracted,
a house to be rifled,

01:22.228 --> 01:25.563
a man to be removed,
the word is passed to me,

01:25.565 --> 01:26.614
the matter is planned

01:26.616 --> 01:28.666
and carried out.

01:28.668 --> 01:32.319
So, you're a pimp, and
assassins are your girls.

01:32.321 --> 01:34.605
Yes, I suppose that's

01:34.607 --> 01:36.407
one way of putting it.

01:36.409 --> 01:38.442
Irene Adler.

01:38.444 --> 01:40.944
Did you have her killed?

01:40.946 --> 01:43.497
That is the question, is it not?

01:43.499 --> 01:45.966
The one that's haunted you
these many months?

01:45.968 --> 01:47.217
Why'd you do it?

01:47.219 --> 01:49.286
And what is your interest in me?

01:49.288 --> 01:51.305
You want answers.

01:51.307 --> 01:53.240
I don't blame you.

01:53.242 --> 01:55.626
But first, I require
something of you.

01:55.628 --> 01:56.844
I'd like to hire you.

01:56.846 --> 01:59.480
Not as an assassin,

01:59.482 --> 02:01.865
though I do believe you'd excel
in that position.

02:01.867 --> 02:05.586
I'd like to secure your services
as an investigator.

02:05.588 --> 02:07.888
A man named Wallace Rourke

02:07.890 --> 02:09.740
was murdered in Brooklyn
several months ago.

02:09.741 --> 02:12.693
The New York Police
Department investigated,

02:12.695 --> 02:14.862
but failed to find any leads.

02:14.864 --> 02:17.298
Bring his killer to justice,
and I promise

02:17.300 --> 02:20.401
I'll give you all the answers
you can handle.

<i>Here we are.</i>

02:50.704 --> 02:52.637
New York Ledger
from December.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.756
Wallace Rourke,
mechanic, age 43,

02:54.758 --> 02:57.308
found stabbed to death
in an alley in Brooklyn.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.077
Can we just take a moment
to talk about

02:59.079 --> 03:00.578
what just happened?
Mr. Rourke's missing wallet

03:00.580 --> 03:01.813
and watch led
the police to suspect

03:01.815 --> 03:03.181
he was the victim of a mugger.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.650
Moriarty, or someone
claiming to be Moriarty,

03:05.652 --> 03:08.019
called and asked you to take
a case, and you're doing it.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.471
And why wouldn't I?
For one thing, he's dangerous.

03:10.473 --> 03:12.307
For another, you think
he's behind Irene's death.

03:12.309 --> 03:14.142
Yes, and in the course
of one brief exchange,

03:14.144 --> 03:15.476
I've already gleaned
that Moriarty

03:15.478 --> 03:17.362
is between 40 and 45
years of age,

03:17.364 --> 03:19.697
he hails from Sussex,
and he has some interest

03:19.699 --> 03:21.900
or connection
to Mr. Wallace Rourke.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.117
As the case continues,

03:23.119 --> 03:24.202
there will be more interactions.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.236
And with each interaction,

03:25.238 --> 03:27.205
more of the man
will be revealed to me.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.740
Assuming the man on the phone
is actually is Moriarty.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.024
Even if it is a mere minion,

03:30.026 --> 03:31.543
just identifying
the minion will get me

03:31.545 --> 03:33.194
one step closer
to identifying the man himself.

03:33.196 --> 03:34.412
How do you know
it's not a trap?

03:34.414 --> 03:36.464
How do you know he doesn't
want to kill you?

03:36.466 --> 03:37.799
He doesn't.
How can you be so sure?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.167
Because three years ago,
he ordered

03:39.169 --> 03:41.202
Daniel Gottlieb
not to kill me.

03:41.204 --> 03:43.671
Last night, I was in the sights
of another assassin's rifle.

03:43.673 --> 03:45.256
Yet, here I sit.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.558
It couldn't be clearer--
he doesn't want me dead.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.809
Then what does he want?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.345
That's precisely
what I intend to find out.

03:53.182 --> 03:54.566
<i>So...</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:56.184
as we already know,

03:56.186 --> 03:57.518
Wallace Rourke was attacked

03:57.520 --> 03:58.820
by an unknown assailant.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.221
His watch, wallet
and cell phone were taken.

04:00.223 --> 04:01.356
He bled to death
in an alleyway...

04:01.358 --> 04:03.107
He was married.

04:03.109 --> 04:05.260
Perhaps a condolence call
to his widow is in order.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.580
Captain Gregson wants a word
with you.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.781
Can it wait?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.250
Not you.
Miss Watson.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.619
Hi. You wanted to see me?

04:14.621 --> 04:16.070
Oh, yeah. Oh, come in.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.704
Sit down. Close the door.

04:17.707 --> 04:19.173
You ever have trouble trying

04:19.175 --> 04:21.759
to remember
your online passwords?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.761
Sure. Sometimes. Why?

04:23.763 --> 04:25.579
I got this friend named Eddie.

04:25.581 --> 04:27.682
We grew up together.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.134
He invented a widget
for storing all your passwords

04:30.136 --> 04:32.687
for your computer
into one place.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.555
You know the one?
Yeah.

04:34.557 --> 04:37.091
He made a fortune,
sold his company,

04:37.093 --> 04:38.943
and he moves his family

04:38.945 --> 04:41.195
down to Boca Raton.
Good for Eddie.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.448
Yeah, but not so good
for his daughter, Kelly.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.300
She ended up with
a pretty serious drug problem.

04:45.302 --> 04:46.651
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:46.653 --> 04:47.986
So Eddie and I were

04:47.988 --> 04:49.787
talking on the phone
the other day.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.373
And he happened to mention that
he and his wife were looking

04:52.375 --> 04:54.125
to hook Kelly up
with a sober companion

04:54.127 --> 04:56.127
after she gets out.
I'm thinking,

04:56.129 --> 04:58.162
I know a great one.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.065
You know that I don't
do kind of work anymore.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.468
Probably only take you
a coup of months.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.887
It's not like you're formally
committed to Holmes anymore.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.472
Right?
Hmm. Speaking of. Oh.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.390
He's already downstairs.
I should go meet him.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.293
But you know what?
I will give you some other names.

05:14.146 --> 05:16.764
I'm sorry, I've never heard

05:16.766 --> 05:18.483
the name "Moriarty"
before in my life.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.118
Does your husband
do any business

05:20.120 --> 05:21.602
with any British people?

05:21.604 --> 05:23.971
Wallace worked in a garage.

05:23.973 --> 05:27.075
I mean, he knew a couple
of Dominican guys.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.110
When the police questioned you,
you mentioned something

05:29.112 --> 05:31.284
about Wallace thinking that
he was being followed.

05:31.309 --> 05:32.281
Yeah.

05:32.282 --> 05:34.148
A few weeks, um, before he died,

05:34.150 --> 05:35.583
he kept seeing the same car

05:35.585 --> 05:37.418
in his rearview mirror,
but it just...

05:37.420 --> 05:39.454
it happened the one time,
so the cops said

05:39.456 --> 05:40.955
it didn't have anything
to do with the mugging.

05:40.957 --> 05:42.523
Are those some
of your husband's things?

05:42.525 --> 05:45.093
Uh, yeah.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.661
Wallace was kind of a packrat.

05:47.663 --> 05:49.564
Do you mind if we take a look?

05:49.566 --> 05:52.383
Yeah.

05:52.385 --> 05:55.803
So, you said

05:55.805 --> 05:57.972
you're consulting
detectives, right?

05:57.974 --> 05:59.607
Not the real kind?

05:59.609 --> 06:02.610
Oh, I assure you, the work
that we do is quite real.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.645
So, does that mean
there's a new lead?

06:04.647 --> 06:06.447
Not exactly,
but sometimes,

06:06.449 --> 06:09.701
new eyes on a case can be just
as useful as new information.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.536
As a matter of fact,

06:11.538 --> 06:12.686
it might be quite useful

06:12.688 --> 06:14.572
to spend a bit more time
with his belongings.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.023
Perhaps we could borrow them
for a few days.

06:16.025 --> 06:17.959
Sure.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.328
Uh, fine, yeah.
Take whatever.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.879
Thanks.

06:23.499 --> 06:25.917
Um, I thought I read
in the police report

06:25.919 --> 06:28.169
that the mugger also stole
your husband's phone.

06:28.171 --> 06:29.887
Yeah, well,
like I said--

06:29.889 --> 06:31.806
Wallace is a packrat.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.707
He never threw anything out.

06:33.709 --> 06:35.209
That's his old phone.

06:35.211 --> 06:36.561
A few weeks before he died,

06:36.563 --> 06:39.263
someone bumped
into him on the street

06:39.265 --> 06:40.815
and spilled coffee all over it.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.551
He had his new one
on him when he died.

06:43.553 --> 06:48.222
Please... please...
find whoever did this.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.908
According to Wallace's
financial records,

06:50.910 --> 06:52.944
him and his wife were living
quite close to the bone.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.579
Is that significant?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.564
Moriarty paid
Sebastian Moran

06:56.566 --> 06:59.567
and Daniel Gottlieb
quite handsomely.

06:59.569 --> 07:03.004
Oh, so, you think Rourke
was working for him, too?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.590
Moran and Gottlieb
were assassins.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.009
Perhaps he did something
less dangerous.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.294
Perhaps he was just good
at hiding his money.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.880
Maybe, but why
would Moriarty want

07:12.882 --> 07:14.715
to expose another
one of his employees?

07:14.717 --> 07:16.684
It seems a little
risky, doesn't it?

07:16.686 --> 07:18.386
It's one of the advantages

07:18.388 --> 07:20.221
of being a shadowy
criminal mastermind, I imagine.

07:20.223 --> 07:21.773
You get to take
the occasional risk.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.691
But I see your point.

07:23.693 --> 07:27.311
According to the M.E.'s report,
Rourke's initial wounds

07:27.313 --> 07:28.980
were these two stabs
to the chest.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.782
The wounds are smooth,
not jagged,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.984
which would seem to
suggest that he was

07:32.986 --> 07:35.119
<i>not moving or struggling</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:36.537
when he was stabbed.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.872
You're saying
he didn't resist?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.907
I'm saying he was motionless

07:39.909 --> 07:42.109
or maybe he was frozen in fear.

07:42.111 --> 07:44.162
Wallace was
a former Army Ranger.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.914
Given his combat experience,
that doesn't seem likely.

07:49.451 --> 07:51.135
See this bruise
below his left ear?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.753
That's from a blow
to the mastoid process.

07:52.755 --> 07:55.339
That's designed to stun.

07:55.341 --> 07:57.842
<i>He wasn't frozen in fear;</i>
<i>he was immobilized.</i>

07:57.844 --> 07:59.977
<i>Then the killer stabbed him</i>
<i>in each lung,</i>

07:59.979 --> 08:01.846
silencing him for good.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.964
Whoever attacked Wallace
wanted him dead,

08:03.966 --> 08:05.566
and knew how to do it.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.652
This is not the work of
your average street thug

08:07.654 --> 08:09.103
looking for a wallet, no.

08:09.105 --> 08:10.855
Moriarty's right.

08:10.857 --> 08:14.058
Obviously, there's more to
this than meets the eye.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.195
And now...

08:17.197 --> 08:20.948
I require sustenance.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:31.760 --> 08:33.494
Out with it, Watson,
or you're gonna spend

08:33.496 --> 08:35.796
all night
almost asking me something.

08:35.798 --> 08:38.716
What was she like?

08:40.352 --> 08:42.687
Irene, you-you talk
about what happened to her,

08:42.688 --> 08:45.223
but you never talk
about who she was.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.191
She was difficult to explain.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.644
And I mean that as a compliment.

08:49.646 --> 08:51.345
She was American.

08:51.347 --> 08:53.397
Really?

08:53.399 --> 08:55.566
I held it against her
only briefly.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.986
She was
an exquisite painter.

08:58.988 --> 09:02.490
She made her living
restoring Renaissance paintings

09:02.492 --> 09:04.525
for art museums.

09:04.527 --> 09:07.712
She traveled extensively
because of her work.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.549
She was highly intelligent,

09:11.551 --> 09:15.052
optimistic
about the human condition.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.171
You mean that
as a compliment, too?

09:17.173 --> 09:19.140
I do, oddly enough.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.893
I usually consider it
a sign of stupidity,

09:21.895 --> 09:23.978
but with Irene, it seemed...

09:23.980 --> 09:25.596
almost convincing.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.548
She was,

09:27.550 --> 09:30.351
to me, <i>the</i> woman.

09:30.353 --> 09:32.403
To me, she eclipsed
and predominated

09:32.405 --> 09:35.773
all of her gender.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.360
She's the one I ever, um...

09:39.362 --> 09:40.912
And the sex...

09:40.914 --> 09:42.496
You-you don't have to...

09:42.498 --> 09:44.081
I learned things, Watson-- me.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.534
And that hasn't happened before.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.870
What is it?

09:49.872 --> 09:51.905
I think Wallace Rourke
might have been right

09:51.907 --> 09:53.474
about being followed.

09:53.476 --> 09:55.793
Have a look at that.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.079
It's an old shipping label.

09:59.081 --> 10:01.716
For the cell phone he had on him
when he died.

10:01.718 --> 10:02.967
Look at the return address.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.770
Uh, "Postal Unlimited.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.755
2249 Lexington Avenue""

10:07.757 --> 10:09.607
All the major
cellular companies ship

10:09.609 --> 10:12.092
from distribution warehouses
upstate.

10:12.094 --> 10:13.778
And how does that equal
him being followed?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.529
Because the simplest way
to follow someone in this day

10:15.531 --> 10:17.431
and age is to track them
via their cell phone.

10:17.433 --> 10:18.749
It's a relatively
simple undertaking

10:18.751 --> 10:20.051
if you have the device's

10:20.053 --> 10:21.902
electronic
identification number.

10:21.904 --> 10:23.371
Which you would have

10:23.373 --> 10:24.622
if you'd supplied
the replacement cell.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.741
So who sent Rourke
his new phone?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.494
You learning anything?

10:30.496 --> 10:32.580
Apparently, if my gut
tells me I'm in danger,

10:32.582 --> 10:33.998
I probably am.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.133
Profound stuff here.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.636
Guy runs one of the biggest
private security firms

10:38.638 --> 10:40.454
in the country;
he's got to know something.

10:40.456 --> 10:42.122
Mr. Holmes, Miss Watson.

10:42.124 --> 10:43.791
Hi.

10:43.793 --> 10:45.259
I'm Daren Sutter.

10:45.261 --> 10:46.761
This is my wife Kate.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.347
We were told you consult
for the NYPD.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.598
We have a few
questions.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.066
If it's all the
same with you,

10:52.068 --> 10:53.818
we'd like to ask
them in private.

10:55.604 --> 10:59.690
Hmm, so you're a third-degree
black belt in Kyokushinkai.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.158
That's impressive.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.244
Yeah, only took me 20 years
of study to pull it off.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.946
Do you practice the,
uh, martial arts?

11:05.948 --> 11:09.000
A bit of single-stick
now and again.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.585
How can we help you?

11:11.587 --> 11:14.338
This is Wallace Rourke.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.840
Your firm was tracking him.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.041
We'd like to know why.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.009
Oh.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.993
No?

11:19.995 --> 11:21.629
No, I'm afraid
we don't recognize him.

11:21.631 --> 11:23.664
Several months ago,
you or one of your employees

11:23.666 --> 11:25.433
ran into Mr. Rourke
and made sure

11:25.435 --> 11:28.469
that his cell phone met its end
via a cup of French Roast.

11:28.471 --> 11:30.304
He ordered another cell
phone from his provider

11:30.306 --> 11:31.305
but, according to them,

11:31.307 --> 11:32.857
never switched it on,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.525
most probably because
it was intercepted en route

11:34.527 --> 11:36.894
by you or another one
of your employees.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.563
Instead, unbeknownst
to Mr. Rourke, he received

11:39.565 --> 11:41.649
and began to use
an identical cell phone

11:41.651 --> 11:43.651
supplied by your company.

11:43.653 --> 11:46.821
We found the shipping label
for that in Rourke's things.

11:46.823 --> 11:49.022
The return address is
for a shipping store

11:49.024 --> 11:50.491
right around the
corner from here.

11:50.493 --> 11:52.576
A helpful gentleman
identified your company

11:52.578 --> 11:54.628
as the one who paid
to have it sent.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.363
Once Rourke activated
your phone,

11:56.365 --> 11:58.031
you were able to monitor
his every move,

11:58.033 --> 12:00.534
and we believe that you did,
right up until the moment

12:00.536 --> 12:04.171
he was stabbed to death
three months ago in Brooklyn.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.374
Actually we only surveilled
Rourke for a couple of days.

12:06.375 --> 12:07.591
Daren...

12:07.593 --> 12:09.343
Well, investigative
work like this

12:09.345 --> 12:11.562
merits at least some kind
of an answer; it's not

12:11.564 --> 12:14.148
as if we can keep denying
any knowledge of Rourke.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.183
Right?

12:16.185 --> 12:17.401
You understand
we're not admitting

12:17.403 --> 12:18.652
to tracking his phone.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.321
No, no, that would be illegal.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.573
We looked into
Mr. Rourke based on threats

12:22.575 --> 12:25.159
he allegedly made
against a client.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.194
After a brief period
of legal surveillance,

12:27.196 --> 12:29.413
we realized the claims
were unfounded;

12:29.415 --> 12:30.781
we stopped the surveillance.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.199
Who was this client?

12:32.201 --> 12:34.085
I'm afraid
that's confidential.

12:36.905 --> 12:40.207
Let me guess: the client who
hired Sutter Risk Management

12:40.209 --> 12:42.343
to investigate
Wallace Rourke is

12:42.345 --> 12:43.744
our new suspect
in his murder.

12:43.746 --> 12:45.846
Now all we have to do
is figure out his name.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.964
Already have.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.583
First name "Made""
second name "Up""

12:49.585 --> 12:51.185
I don't believe he exists.
Why not?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.586
Because I believe
we've already met

12:52.588 --> 12:54.054
Wallace Rourke's murderer,

12:54.056 --> 12:56.273
and he's the spitting
image of this man.

13:03.401 --> 13:04.451
Daren Sutter's book

13:04.453 --> 13:06.135
amounts to a
virtual confession

13:06.163 --> 13:08.129
to the murder of
Wallace Rourke.

13:08.131 --> 13:10.148
He published that book
five years ago.

13:10.150 --> 13:11.866
How'd he confess to something
he hadn't done yet?

13:11.868 --> 13:13.218
The book is more than

13:13.220 --> 13:15.286
a mass market précis
of his insights

13:15.288 --> 13:17.038
into security and
risk management.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.224
It is a window into what
drew him to the field

13:19.226 --> 13:20.541
in the first place.

13:20.543 --> 13:22.894
Look at page 13.

13:22.896 --> 13:26.064
February, 1991,
Westport, Connecticut--

13:26.066 --> 13:27.732
Sutter was 23.

13:27.734 --> 13:29.050
His older sister Leah was

13:29.052 --> 13:30.018
brutally murdered during

13:30.020 --> 13:31.769
what the police believe was

13:31.771 --> 13:33.238
<i>a home invasion robbery.</i>

13:33.240 --> 13:35.857
<i>Sutter was staying with her</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

13:35.859 --> 13:37.458
Oh, he got home just as the
perpetrator fled the house.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.610
More than that.

13:38.612 --> 13:40.328
He came face-to-face
with the man.

13:40.330 --> 13:43.581
He gave the police
a full description.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.900
Enough for them to generate...

13:45.902 --> 13:49.754
a detailed sketch.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.157
So you think Wallace Rourke is

13:53.159 --> 13:56.211
the one who killed
Sutter's sister 22 years ago.

13:56.213 --> 13:57.712
The police never
caught the culprit.

13:57.714 --> 14:00.381
Sutter was tormented
by his failure

14:00.383 --> 14:02.717
to protect her and law
enforcement's failure

14:02.719 --> 14:05.553
to catch killer-- it
became his raison d'étre.

14:05.555 --> 14:06.754
He dropped out of
business school.

14:06.756 --> 14:08.022
He began to study
law enforcement,

14:08.024 --> 14:10.808
security... and
Kyokushinkai karate,

14:10.810 --> 14:13.261
which utilizes
mastoid strikes.

14:13.263 --> 14:16.648
Just like the blow used
to stun Wallace Rourke

14:16.650 --> 14:17.815
before he was stabbed to death.

14:17.817 --> 14:19.600
Now all you really
know is that

14:19.602 --> 14:22.320
Wallace Rourke has
a passing resemblance

14:22.322 --> 14:23.988
to an old police sketch.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.407
Did he have
a criminal history?

14:26.409 --> 14:28.293
According to his Army record,
he enlisted under a waiver,

14:28.295 --> 14:30.278
which means a judge
gave him the choice

14:30.280 --> 14:32.213
between prison or the Army.

14:32.215 --> 14:34.966
His conviction was for
breaking and entering.

14:34.968 --> 14:36.617
Can we place Rourke
anywhere near the murder?

14:36.619 --> 14:40.454
Following his discharge from
the Army in November 1990,

14:40.456 --> 14:42.257
Rourke moved back to
his mother's house

14:42.259 --> 14:45.426
in Stamford, Connecticut,
which I believe

14:45.428 --> 14:47.428
is half an hour's drive
from where Leah was killed.

14:47.430 --> 14:49.897
So it is possible that,
over 20 years ago,

14:49.899 --> 14:51.516
Wallace Rourke killed
Sutter's sister.

14:51.518 --> 14:53.901
And that Rourke's recent death
was the result

14:53.903 --> 14:57.805
of Sutter tracking him down
and killing him in retribution.

14:57.807 --> 15:00.325
But why does Moriarty care
about any of this?

15:00.327 --> 15:03.111
I would venture he wants us
to bring down Sutter.

15:03.113 --> 15:05.980
Sutter's security firm,
as you yourself pointed out,

15:05.982 --> 15:07.665
is one of the best
in the country.

15:07.667 --> 15:09.117
With Sutter removed, it would

15:09.119 --> 15:10.818
in theory, make his
clients more vulnerable.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.087
Moriarty may have one of
them in his crosshairs.

15:13.089 --> 15:14.172
Which means our work
on this case

15:14.174 --> 15:15.823
could cost someone
their life.

15:15.825 --> 15:18.543
Not if our work leads to
Moriarty's undoing first.

15:18.545 --> 15:20.962
Which will mean we save that
person and anyone else

15:20.964 --> 15:22.797
Moriarty intends to
victimize in the future.

15:22.799 --> 15:24.799
Okay, let's say you're right--
Moriarty planned this.

15:24.801 --> 15:26.050
That would mean he already knew

15:26.052 --> 15:27.935
that Sutter killed
Wallace Rourke.

15:27.937 --> 15:29.437
Which is why I've arranged
to speak with Sutter

15:29.439 --> 15:31.055
first thing in the
morning in private.

15:31.057 --> 15:33.775
"In private"?

15:33.777 --> 15:35.393
It's gonna be a very
delicate conversation.

15:35.395 --> 15:36.611
For what it's worth,

15:36.613 --> 15:38.229
he's not bringing
his wife either.

15:50.326 --> 15:52.293
Mr. Sutter, thank you
for meeting me.

15:52.295 --> 15:54.495
Stand up, please.

15:57.966 --> 15:59.367
Okay...

15:59.369 --> 16:01.719
Can you tell me what
you're doing there?

16:01.721 --> 16:02.720
It's a bug-sweeper.

16:02.722 --> 16:03.838
I'm checking
for listening devices.

16:06.376 --> 16:08.259
Okay.

16:08.261 --> 16:10.011
Right.

16:12.649 --> 16:13.714
Okay.

16:13.716 --> 16:16.717
Thank you. Your turn.

16:16.719 --> 16:18.519
When you've heard
what I have to say,

16:18.521 --> 16:19.904
you'll want to be quite sure

16:19.906 --> 16:21.722
we're not being recorded.

16:25.745 --> 16:28.029
Excellent, good.

16:28.031 --> 16:31.416
Now then, I'm curious.

16:31.418 --> 16:34.402
How do you feel since
you killed Wallace Rourke?

16:34.404 --> 16:36.087
Okay, we're done.
No, no, listen to me.

16:36.089 --> 16:40.091
Consider it an inquiry from
one scarred man to another.

16:40.093 --> 16:41.876
Or rather from one man to one

16:41.878 --> 16:45.246
whose wounds have
finally begun to heal.

16:45.248 --> 16:46.597
I can tell the change from
the pictures in your office.

16:46.599 --> 16:48.299
<i>Since December</i>
<i>you've lost 15 pounds,</i>

16:48.301 --> 16:50.852
<i>you got rid of the bags</i>
<i>under your eyes.</i>

16:50.854 --> 16:53.087
Both signs
of a lifting depression.

16:53.089 --> 16:56.524
Avenging your sister's death
has... has freed you.

16:56.526 --> 16:58.059
I told you--
we surveilled Rourke

16:58.061 --> 16:59.427
for a couple of days;
that's it.

16:59.429 --> 17:00.561
You're a terrible liar.

17:00.563 --> 17:01.729
Actually, I'm an
excellent liar.

17:01.731 --> 17:02.930
No, no, no--
better than most

17:02.932 --> 17:04.898
and excellent are
two different things.

17:04.901 --> 17:07.435
I know that you killed Rourke.

17:07.436 --> 17:09.554
If you had proof, you'd be
talking to the police, right?

17:09.556 --> 17:11.172
I don't have
any proof yet.

17:11.174 --> 17:13.124
It's just a matter of time.

17:13.126 --> 17:15.292
Unless we can find some way

17:15.295 --> 17:18.329
to divert my attention.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.748
Moriarty.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.215
Does the name mean
anything to you?

17:22.218 --> 17:24.001
Should it?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.386
Yes, it should.

17:25.387 --> 17:27.505
He pointed me
in your direction.

17:27.507 --> 17:30.258
I think he wishes to profit
from your incarceration.

17:30.260 --> 17:31.726
I'm just not sure how.

17:31.728 --> 17:34.145
I've never heard that name
before in my life.

17:34.147 --> 17:37.098
Now you're telling the truth.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.233
Okay, I'm gonna need access
to your client files.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.468
See if I can discern
if there's a link

17:40.470 --> 17:42.019
between him and one of them.

17:42.021 --> 17:44.188
You want me to trust
you with my business

17:44.190 --> 17:46.441
based on some crazy story
about a mystery man

17:46.443 --> 17:47.658
plotting my demise?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.993
No.

17:48.995 --> 17:51.312
Some proof then.

17:51.314 --> 17:54.031
Judging by the precision
with which you killed Rourke,

17:54.033 --> 17:56.617
not to mention
Moriarty's resources,

17:56.619 --> 17:58.819
I wouldn't be surprised if he
learned of your transgression

17:58.821 --> 18:01.372
via listening device
in your office and/or home.

18:01.374 --> 18:03.624
Impossible-- we sweep
both regularly.

18:03.626 --> 18:05.843
"Regularly"-- so if one
knew the schedule,

18:05.845 --> 18:08.679
then one could remove
and replace bugs as needed.

18:08.681 --> 18:10.998
So, sweep them today,
see what you find,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.050
then contact me and we'll talk
about your clients.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.475
Are you trying to
get rid of me?

18:21.510 --> 18:22.477
What're...?

18:22.479 --> 18:23.844
What are you talking about?

18:23.846 --> 18:25.146
Well, your friend in Boca,

18:25.148 --> 18:27.148
the one whose daughter
needs a companion,

18:27.150 --> 18:28.349
I-I just feel like
you're pushing me

18:28.351 --> 18:29.450
to take that offer.

18:29.452 --> 18:30.785
Are you unhappy with my work?

18:30.787 --> 18:33.187
No, of course not.

18:33.189 --> 18:35.706
I appreciate the work
you've done with Holmes.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.909
And, uh, you're
turning into a...

18:37.911 --> 18:41.195
pretty damn good investigator
in your own right.

18:41.197 --> 18:42.696
But...?

18:44.032 --> 18:46.167
Have a seat.

18:49.721 --> 18:52.206
There's something you got
to try to understand.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.426
Guys like him,

18:55.428 --> 18:57.345
they walk between the raindrops.

18:57.347 --> 18:58.479
They don't get wet.

18:58.481 --> 19:00.064
People like you do.

19:00.066 --> 19:02.767
People like
his ex-girlfriend do.

19:02.769 --> 19:05.102
So you're concerned
about my safety.

19:05.104 --> 19:07.238
In case you haven't noticed,

19:07.240 --> 19:10.057
a lot of bodies been dropping
around our boy of late.

19:10.059 --> 19:11.993
You're in the danger zone, also.

19:11.995 --> 19:14.245
I've been a cop for 30 years.

19:14.247 --> 19:15.396
I carry a gun.

19:15.398 --> 19:17.365
And a penis.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.283
You think this is
about you being a woman?

19:19.285 --> 19:21.168
I'm just don't understand
why you are concerned

19:21.170 --> 19:23.087
about my safety specifically.

19:23.089 --> 19:26.290
No one, and I mean no one,
is closer to this guy

19:26.292 --> 19:29.243
than you are-- you live in
his house, for crying out loud.

19:29.245 --> 19:30.578
He needs me right now.

19:30.580 --> 19:34.265
That guy is always
gonna need someone.

19:34.267 --> 19:37.768
He may be the smartest guy
I've ever met in my life.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.688
But he is also
the most self-absorbed.

19:40.690 --> 19:43.774
He probably doesn't
even recognize

19:43.776 --> 19:45.643
the danger you're in.

19:45.645 --> 19:47.361
I do.

19:50.149 --> 19:53.484
Captain...sorry to interrupt,
but there's a Daren Sutter here

19:53.486 --> 19:55.536
from Sutter Risk Management.

19:55.538 --> 19:57.779
Says he wants to confess
to the murder of Wallace Rourke.

19:58.574 --> 20:01.442
Uh, I came across Wallace Rourke

20:01.444 --> 20:03.544
after a routine
background check.

20:03.546 --> 20:05.129
He was a mechanic.

20:05.131 --> 20:08.249
He applied for a position
at a high-end dealership.

20:08.251 --> 20:11.802
My company was responsible for
reviewing the three finalists.

20:11.804 --> 20:14.472
And how did you know he was
the man who killed your sister?

20:14.474 --> 20:16.390
I recognized him
immediately.

20:16.392 --> 20:18.792
It's been 22 years since
Leah was murdered,

20:18.794 --> 20:21.479
and I still remember
everything about that night.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.514
Especially him.

20:23.516 --> 20:25.316
Okay...

20:25.318 --> 20:26.467
why don't we start
at the beginning?

20:26.469 --> 20:27.985
He found them.

20:27.987 --> 20:30.137
Moriarty's bugs.

20:30.139 --> 20:32.857
You think that's how Moriarty
knew he killed Rourke?

20:32.859 --> 20:34.909
He knows that someone can
prove that he killed Rourke,

20:34.911 --> 20:36.777
and he's confessing to
get out ahead of it,

20:36.779 --> 20:38.479
and get the best
deal that he can.

20:38.481 --> 20:40.848
If only he'd followed
instruction.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.333
Come to me instead.

20:42.335 --> 20:44.452
Probably thought you were
part of the conspiracy.

20:44.454 --> 20:47.004
I suppose, in a sense, I am.

20:50.342 --> 20:52.543
So, what now?

20:52.545 --> 20:54.045
We've done as
Moriarty asked.

20:54.047 --> 20:55.513
I found Wallace
Rourke's killer

20:55.515 --> 20:57.431
and brought him to justice.

20:57.433 --> 20:58.799
Now we await his call.

20:58.801 --> 21:00.101
And my answers.

21:00.103 --> 21:02.169
Personal security expert
Daren Sutter,

21:02.171 --> 21:06.273
who was best known for his book
<i>Friend or Foe,</i> has confessed

21:06.275 --> 21:08.275
to the murder of Wallace Rourke,

21:08.277 --> 21:11.112
whom he alleges was responsible
for the murder of his sister

21:11.114 --> 21:12.563
22 years ago.

21:12.565 --> 21:14.348
Leah Sutter, who is
Daren's older sister...

21:14.350 --> 21:16.901
Okay, that is
not distracting <i>at all.</i>

21:16.903 --> 21:19.820
Moriarty must know about
Sutter's arrest by now.

21:19.822 --> 21:21.122
Why hasn't he called?

21:21.124 --> 21:23.190
Moriarty, as you
so eloquently put it,

21:23.192 --> 21:24.959
is an assassin pimp.

21:24.961 --> 21:26.344
Did you really think
if you solved this case,

21:26.346 --> 21:27.495
he'd keep up to his side
of the bargain?

21:27.497 --> 21:28.696
I'm well aware that

21:28.698 --> 21:30.381
Moriarty is playing with me.

21:30.383 --> 21:32.166
Just because I can't predict
his next move,

21:32.168 --> 21:36.036
doesn't mean I can't
expect him to make one.

21:36.038 --> 21:38.673
Why were you at the police
station the other day

21:38.675 --> 21:40.141
when Sutter came
in to confess?

21:40.143 --> 21:41.976
I needed to talk to Gregson.

21:41.978 --> 21:43.811
Was this a continuation of your
earlier mysterious conversation

21:43.813 --> 21:45.763
with him or is it
an entirely new one?

21:58.627 --> 22:00.961
I see Daren Sutter
is under arrest.

22:00.963 --> 22:02.196
Congratulations.

22:02.198 --> 22:03.781
I held up my half
of the bargain,

22:03.783 --> 22:05.666
I expect you to do the same.

22:05.668 --> 22:09.537
To the contrary, you've only
revealed part of the truth.

22:09.539 --> 22:10.838
I owe you nothing.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.173
You want the whole truth?

22:12.175 --> 22:13.591
I know a great deal
more than you think.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.092
I know that Sutter
was your target all along.

22:15.094 --> 22:16.927
I know that you had him
under surveillance.

22:16.929 --> 22:18.629
I know that you didn't want
to reveal that surveillance

22:18.631 --> 22:20.598
to the authorities, so you
utilized me to expose him.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.416
You're slipping, Holmes.

22:22.418 --> 22:25.019
I'm referring to the truth
about Leah Sutter's murder.

22:25.021 --> 22:26.920
Wallace Rourke killed her.

22:26.922 --> 22:29.857
No, in fact, he did not.

22:29.859 --> 22:30.975
He had an alibi.

22:30.977 --> 22:32.943
Let me guess:
his mother swears

22:32.945 --> 22:35.362
that she dealt him into her
bridge hand that evening.

22:35.364 --> 22:37.031
After Rourke left the Army,

22:37.033 --> 22:39.233
his mail went to his mother's
house in Connecticut,

22:39.235 --> 22:40.735
but Rourke did not.

22:40.737 --> 22:43.204
He was in Saudi Arabia doing
off-the-books work

22:43.206 --> 22:44.705
for an American oil company.

22:44.707 --> 22:47.941
He didn't return
until March 1991.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.911
Sutter swears
that he saw him.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.213
Sutter is wrong.

22:52.215 --> 22:53.998
He killed the wrong man.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.884
And your work is far from done.

22:56.886 --> 22:58.302
Finish it.

23:11.614 --> 23:13.564
Oh, good, you're awake.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.866
Oh... how long was I out?

23:14.868 --> 23:16.451
107 minutes.

23:16.453 --> 23:18.503
Precisely enough time to cycle
through all five stages

23:18.505 --> 23:20.538
of REM and non-REM sleep,

23:20.540 --> 23:22.240
leaving your mind clear
for the day's labor.

23:24.678 --> 23:26.211
Oh... have you made
any progress?

23:26.213 --> 23:27.795
If by "progress""

23:27.797 --> 23:30.048
you mean have I proven
that Moriarty was wrong

23:30.050 --> 23:32.217
and Wallace Rourke killed
Daren Sutter's sister,

23:32.219 --> 23:34.686
as Daren and myself had
come to believe, then, no,

23:34.688 --> 23:36.804
I have made
the opposite of progress.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.256
Ugh. So Rourke <i>was</i>
in Saudi Arabia

23:38.258 --> 23:39.557
at the time of the murder.

23:39.559 --> 23:41.092
I can't prove that.

23:41.094 --> 23:44.229
Nor, unfortunately, can I prove
he was anywhere else.

23:44.231 --> 23:46.965
After Rourke left the Army
in 1990,

23:46.967 --> 23:48.866
his mail and
his personal effects

23:48.868 --> 23:51.536
went to his mother's place
in Connecticut.

23:51.538 --> 23:53.938
There is nothing to suggest
that Rourke accompanied them.

23:53.940 --> 23:57.275
There's no credit card
purchases, no...

23:57.277 --> 23:59.410
no bank withdrawals...
no financial activity at all.

23:59.412 --> 24:00.878
Monetarily... a ghost.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.714
Maybe his mother paid
for everything.

24:02.716 --> 24:04.582
An arrangement
which is not unheard of.

24:04.584 --> 24:08.720
However, Rourke's
medical records show

24:08.722 --> 24:10.388
that shortly before
he left the Army,

24:10.390 --> 24:11.956
he refilled his
malaria pill prescription.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.575
He also received
a typhoid booster.

24:14.577 --> 24:16.627
So it's possible that he was
planning to stay in Kuwait.

24:16.629 --> 24:19.463
He also received
a vaccination for...

24:19.465 --> 24:21.099
meningococcal disease.

24:21.101 --> 24:23.434
Inoculation for that disease
is only required

24:23.436 --> 24:26.637
for travel to
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia!

24:26.639 --> 24:28.906
Again, not proof.

24:28.908 --> 24:30.308
But it is a suggestive detail

24:30.310 --> 24:31.859
which I should have noticed
before.

24:31.861 --> 24:35.530
I also should have noticed
the $30,000 deposit

24:35.532 --> 24:38.449
made to Rourke from a shell
corporation in April 1991,

24:38.451 --> 24:40.418
mostly likely a payment
for his services

24:40.420 --> 24:42.870
to the oil company.
Still not conclusive.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.822
And our assignment was to find
the killer for Wallace Rourke,

24:44.824 --> 24:46.324
not Leah Sutter.

24:46.326 --> 24:49.377
A case which-- I have just
bothered to find out--

24:49.379 --> 24:51.829
unidentified fingerprints were
found on Leah's door

24:51.831 --> 24:53.214
after her death.

24:53.216 --> 24:54.498
Now they could have been
left behind by someone

24:54.500 --> 24:56.167
unrelated to the case.

24:56.169 --> 24:57.635
They could have been left
by a deliveryman, pizza boy.

24:57.637 --> 24:59.220
But the police
have long suspected

24:59.222 --> 25:00.638
they were left by Leah's killer.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.507
I'm guessing that
the fingerprints

25:02.509 --> 25:04.008
were not a match
for Wallace Rourke?

25:04.010 --> 25:05.676
Correct.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.680
All of which would suggest
that Moriarty may be right.

25:08.682 --> 25:10.615
Daren Sutter killed
an innocent man.

25:10.617 --> 25:13.534
Maybe Moriarty's right
because he set Sutter up.

25:13.536 --> 25:14.786
An excellent theory,

25:14.788 --> 25:16.020
hindered only by the fact

25:16.022 --> 25:17.705
that it is nigh on impossible.

25:17.707 --> 25:19.290
It's completely possible.

25:19.292 --> 25:20.958
Moriarty said he did
things like this for a living.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.994
Daren Sutter saw
his sister's killer

25:22.996 --> 25:24.528
running away from her body.

25:24.530 --> 25:25.963
His face is etched onto

25:25.965 --> 25:27.548
his brain.
How does anyone,

25:27.550 --> 25:28.933
including Moriarty,

25:28.935 --> 25:30.868
trick a man into killing someone
other than

25:30.870 --> 25:32.837
the person he saw?
It's been over 20 years.

25:32.839 --> 25:34.538
Memories get distorted,
influenced...

25:34.540 --> 25:37.875
No, no, not the memory of
the person who took your sister,

25:37.877 --> 25:39.927
who took someone you loved
from you.

25:43.048 --> 25:45.049
It is a conundrum.

25:46.985 --> 25:48.936
But once solved...

25:48.938 --> 25:51.722
we will have the complete truth
which Moriarty has requested.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.608
This taste in my mouth
is horrid.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.734
If you want to use the toilet,
I'll just turn away.

26:03.736 --> 26:06.204
You didn't have asparagus
last night, did you?

26:06.206 --> 26:08.447
Why do you think Moriarty's
putting you through all this?

26:09.341 --> 26:11.909
Well, he obviously
views me as an enemy.

26:11.911 --> 26:14.245
Yes, but why?

26:15.631 --> 26:16.964
I must have interrupted

26:16.966 --> 26:18.249
some criminal enterprise
of his in London.

26:18.251 --> 26:19.750
Well, then why
didn't he just kill you?

26:19.752 --> 26:20.968
Why do what he did
to Irene,

26:20.970 --> 26:22.854
and why is he making you

26:22.856 --> 26:24.939
jump through hoops,
now that you're in New York?

26:26.692 --> 26:28.776
Uh, he's a more
complex opponent

26:28.778 --> 26:30.728
than I have faced
in some time.

26:30.730 --> 26:33.431
Are you even afraid of him?

26:35.567 --> 26:37.285
I find fear to be
an unproductive filter

26:37.287 --> 26:39.787
with which to view the world.
It dampens my powers of...

26:39.789 --> 26:42.106
Can't you just answer a question
like a normal human being?

26:42.108 --> 26:43.241
As I mentioned earlier,

26:43.243 --> 26:45.042
he clearly doesn't
want to kill me,

26:45.044 --> 26:46.828
so, no, I'm not afraid.

26:47.779 --> 26:49.780
Well, there are ways
to hurt you

26:49.782 --> 26:52.667
that do not involve
hurting... you.

26:59.641 --> 27:02.643
Watson, you know that
there are risks entailed

27:02.645 --> 27:06.464
in the work that I--
that <i>we--</i> perform.

27:06.466 --> 27:08.766
You cannot do the work
without undertaking those risks.

27:08.768 --> 27:09.984
But know this:

27:09.986 --> 27:11.352
as far as Moriarty
is concerned,

27:11.354 --> 27:14.272
I will never allow
any harm to come to you.

27:14.274 --> 27:16.257
Not ever.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.276
You can't promise that.

27:18.278 --> 27:19.827
And yet, I have.

27:21.296 --> 27:22.997
Now...

27:22.999 --> 27:24.749
given the amount of questions
which need answering,

27:24.751 --> 27:25.983
I propose that we split up.

27:25.985 --> 27:27.952
I will go and see
Mr. Sutter again,

27:27.954 --> 27:30.288
see if he can't shed some more
light on the situation.

27:30.290 --> 27:32.173
You pay a visit to Mrs. Sutter.

27:32.175 --> 27:33.791
See if you can't
convince her

27:33.793 --> 27:35.793
that access to
the firm's client list

27:35.795 --> 27:38.963
might help us find the man who
put them in this predicament.

27:38.965 --> 27:40.348
Okay?

27:47.672 --> 27:50.775
Wallace Rourke
killed my sister.

27:50.777 --> 27:53.361
The evidence suggests...
What evidence?

27:53.363 --> 27:55.012
It's an assortment of facts

27:55.014 --> 27:56.731
arranged to support
what you want to believe.

27:56.733 --> 27:58.065
I don't <i>want</i>
to believe anything.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.735
I <i>want</i> to make sense
of this.

28:00.737 --> 28:02.987
I acknowledge that the evidence
that Rourke was

28:02.989 --> 28:05.790
out of the country
is-is far from iron-clad.

28:05.792 --> 28:07.825
And yet it seems unwise
to ignore the possibility

28:07.827 --> 28:09.043
that you were misled.

28:09.045 --> 28:12.079
If you were, who stands
to benefit from that?

28:12.081 --> 28:13.548
You're being played.

28:13.550 --> 28:15.917
Manipulated by whoever
sent you down this path.

28:15.919 --> 28:17.668
Well aware of that possibility.

28:17.670 --> 28:20.471
And yet, as unlikely
as it seems,

28:20.473 --> 28:22.473
it is at least possible

28:22.475 --> 28:24.675
that you were tricked
into killing the wrong man.

28:24.677 --> 28:26.377
Okay.

28:26.379 --> 28:28.095
You said the other day
I'm a terrible liar?

28:28.097 --> 28:30.047
You tell me if
I'm lying right now.

28:30.049 --> 28:33.434
Wallace Rourke
murdered my sister.

28:36.054 --> 28:37.605
If there is a crime to be done,

28:37.607 --> 28:38.839
a paper to be abstracted,

28:38.841 --> 28:40.308
a house to be rifled,

28:40.310 --> 28:41.776
a man to be removed...

28:41.778 --> 28:43.344
the word is passed to me,

28:43.346 --> 28:45.896
the matter is planned...
No, I'm sorry.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.782
I've never heard
this man's voice before.

28:47.784 --> 28:50.501
Like I said, Mr. Holmes and I

28:50.503 --> 28:52.703
believe that he may be targeting
one of your clients.

28:52.705 --> 28:55.172
Now, if you would allow me
to look at your list,

28:55.174 --> 28:56.757
we might be able to figure out...
I'm sorry.

28:56.759 --> 28:59.143
Our clients need to be able
to trust our discretion

28:59.145 --> 29:01.329
as much as our ability
to keep them safe.

29:01.331 --> 29:03.898
And as far as your theory
that this man is behind

29:03.900 --> 29:06.017
some conspiracy
to bring Daren down...

29:06.019 --> 29:08.436
You found bugs in here,
didn't you?

29:08.438 --> 29:11.222
Let's say that we did.

29:11.224 --> 29:13.107
There's a lot of people
who'd like to know

29:13.109 --> 29:14.609
what's going on
inside these walls.

29:14.611 --> 29:16.594
And even if the man
you're referring to

29:16.596 --> 29:18.512
is surveilling us,

29:18.514 --> 29:20.831
he couldn't possibly have set
Daren up to kill the wrong man.

29:20.833 --> 29:23.200
Daren saw Wallace Rourke's
face that night.

29:23.202 --> 29:25.786
Isn't it possible
that he got it wrong?

29:25.788 --> 29:28.439
That after so many years
of wanting to find the killer,

29:28.441 --> 29:30.324
he was ready
to believe he had?

29:30.326 --> 29:33.644
There's no way he would make
a mistake like that.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.796
You have to understand--
for Daren...

29:35.798 --> 29:38.249
his life is divided
into two halves:

29:38.251 --> 29:40.618
before Leah's murder, and after.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.970
Did you know Daren
before she died?

29:42.972 --> 29:44.622
I wish I had.

29:44.624 --> 29:48.259
I actually met Daren
at a candlelight vigil

29:48.261 --> 29:50.094
the town was holding for Leah.

29:50.096 --> 29:53.180
That is a very complicated time
to get involved.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.349
It was a complicated
time to meet.

29:55.351 --> 29:57.852
We didn't get involved
until a few months after.

29:57.854 --> 30:00.271
Daren found closure

30:00.273 --> 30:02.806
when he killed Wallace Rourke.

30:02.808 --> 30:05.809
Am I sad that he's in jail?

30:05.811 --> 30:08.613
Yes.

30:08.615 --> 30:12.083
But I'm also grateful
that he finally...

30:12.085 --> 30:13.501
found some peace.

30:17.322 --> 30:19.957
Sherlock? You here?

30:25.464 --> 30:27.932
Oh. Well, my meeting
with Kate Sutter was a bust.

30:27.934 --> 30:29.967
She's not giving up
their client list.

30:29.969 --> 30:32.553
Her husband refused
to discuss his enemies,

30:32.555 --> 30:35.022
as that would entertain the
notion that he was being set up.

30:35.024 --> 30:38.225
So I began
to catalogue them myself,

30:38.227 --> 30:40.778
using some files I got
from Detective Bell.

30:40.780 --> 30:43.731
As the head of a successful
risk management firm,

30:43.733 --> 30:48.018
Sutter's put away a long list
of stalkers, abusive husbands,

30:48.020 --> 30:49.487
and dangerous obsessives.

30:49.489 --> 30:51.539
Well, it looks like
a pretty competitive field.

30:51.541 --> 30:53.741
On top of that,
he shared his obsession

30:53.743 --> 30:55.409
with his sister's killer
with the world,

30:55.411 --> 30:56.661
so there's no shortage of people

30:56.663 --> 30:58.829
who know about
his Achilles' heel.

31:00.216 --> 31:01.532
Are you all right?

31:01.534 --> 31:03.050
Yeah, I'm just a bit stiff.

31:03.052 --> 31:04.502
Been sitting for too long.

31:09.541 --> 31:12.810
I'm just...

31:12.812 --> 31:15.045
Forgive me.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.815
The last few days have
just-just, uh, taken their toll.

31:19.018 --> 31:21.385
To be so...

31:21.387 --> 31:25.106
so close some answers which
I've sought for... so long.

31:26.942 --> 31:29.110
I cannot come up empty-handed.

31:32.497 --> 31:34.565
Why don't you go get
something to eat?

31:35.534 --> 31:36.917
I will clean up.

32:09.284 --> 32:12.870
I was just thinking how
difficult this case is for you.

32:12.872 --> 32:14.622
I know how badly
Moriarty hurt you,

32:14.624 --> 32:16.323
and I was just thinking, I wish

32:16.325 --> 32:18.509
that I could fix it for you.

32:19.778 --> 32:21.328
I appreciate the sentiment,
Watson,

32:21.330 --> 32:24.632
but I fear that your goal
may be unobtainable.

32:24.634 --> 32:27.168
What about Daren Sutter?

32:27.170 --> 32:28.619
I mean, he's a lot like you.

32:28.621 --> 32:31.388
Except he got what he wanted.

32:31.390 --> 32:33.641
He's at peace now.

32:33.643 --> 32:35.392
We've been trying
to identify people

32:35.394 --> 32:37.144
who wanted to tear Sutter down,

32:37.146 --> 32:40.097
but what if he was tricked
into killing Wallace Rourke

32:40.099 --> 32:42.132
by someone who wanted
to lift him up?

32:55.937 --> 32:57.254
If this is about Daren,

32:57.256 --> 32:58.572
I don't feel comfortable
answering questions

32:58.574 --> 33:00.007
without his attorney.

33:00.009 --> 33:01.592
Well, actually, Mrs. Sutter,
this is about you.

33:01.594 --> 33:03.744
We were hoping that you might
be able to confirm

33:03.746 --> 33:06.380
exactly when you met
your husband.

33:06.382 --> 33:09.133
Well, as I told Ms. Watson,
it was in 1991,

33:09.135 --> 33:10.601
at a vigil for his sister Leah.

33:10.603 --> 33:12.219
So that would be
after her death?

33:12.221 --> 33:13.604
Obviously.

33:13.606 --> 33:15.940
Well, being with Daren
as long as you have,

33:15.942 --> 33:18.392
I'd assume you know as much
about her case as anyone.

33:18.394 --> 33:20.093
So surely you know
that partial fingerprints

33:20.095 --> 33:22.262
were found on her front door
that night.

33:22.264 --> 33:23.397
They were
never identified,

33:23.399 --> 33:24.865
but police thought
there was a chance

33:24.867 --> 33:27.952
they belonged
to the killer.

33:27.954 --> 33:29.620
They belonged to you.

33:29.622 --> 33:31.605
<i>'Cause you were the one who</i>
<i>came through the door</i>

33:31.607 --> 33:33.123
<i>that night; not your husband.</i>

33:33.125 --> 33:36.276
You handled
Ms. Watson's phone yesterday.

33:36.278 --> 33:38.295
We were able to pull your prints
and compare them

33:38.297 --> 33:39.580
to the ones from
Leah's house.

33:39.582 --> 33:40.781
They matched.

33:40.783 --> 33:42.583
That means you lied to me.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.551
You did know Daren
before Leah died.

33:44.553 --> 33:46.670
We checked
public records.

33:46.672 --> 33:49.340
You were married to
another man at this time.

33:49.342 --> 33:52.149
And and Mr. Sutter
were having an affair.

33:52.174 --> 33:53.538
Okay.

33:54.462 --> 33:57.564
So Daren and I were together
before Leah died-- so what?

33:57.566 --> 33:59.266
So...

33:59.268 --> 34:01.101
now we know why
he was so certain

34:01.103 --> 34:03.070
he killed the right man
all those months ago.

34:03.072 --> 34:05.522
'Cause you told him
it was the right man.

34:05.524 --> 34:08.242
He never saw
the killer's face; you did.

34:08.244 --> 34:11.143
But you couldn't admit that
without revealing your affair.

34:11.146 --> 34:13.530
And, so, Daren
became the official witness,

34:13.532 --> 34:16.166
relaying all the details you
saw, as if you were the one

34:16.168 --> 34:17.818
who that came in
the door that night.

34:17.820 --> 34:18.985
Problem solved.

34:18.987 --> 34:20.704
Till the police
couldn't find the man

34:20.706 --> 34:22.005
you described to Daren.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.757
That was hard on Daren.

34:23.759 --> 34:25.509
And you.

34:25.511 --> 34:28.344
22 years later,
you came across

34:28.347 --> 34:30.699
a man who you
thought would pass

34:30.725 --> 34:32.725
for an older version

34:32.768 --> 34:35.002
of the man in
this sketch.

34:35.004 --> 34:36.954
And that was
Wallace Rourke.

34:36.956 --> 34:38.889
And the only way you could
give your husband the peace

34:38.891 --> 34:42.275
that he'd never had was to insist
that Wallace Rourke

34:42.277 --> 34:44.277
was the man that
you saw that night.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.513
He was the man I saw that night.

34:46.514 --> 34:48.399
Rourke killed Leah.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.850
As a matter of fact,
he didn't.

34:49.851 --> 34:52.569
We were just able to confirm,
a little while ago,

34:52.571 --> 34:56.123
he wasn't even in the country
at the time of the murder.

34:56.125 --> 34:58.659
<i>You saw someone else</i>
<i>that night.</i>

34:58.661 --> 35:02.296
Now listen,

35:02.298 --> 35:06.333
your husband is gonna find
out about this sooner or later.

35:06.335 --> 35:08.419
Why don't you
do yourself a favor,

35:08.421 --> 35:11.088
and tell us
the whole story.

35:16.544 --> 35:18.645
I loved Leah, too.

35:18.647 --> 35:19.897
But she wasn't my sister.

35:19.899 --> 35:21.732
She was Daren's.

35:21.734 --> 35:26.687
What happened that night,
it... it changed him.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.689
I didn't love him any less.

35:28.691 --> 35:31.058
If anything, I loved him more.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.027
Doing what we do here

35:33.029 --> 35:34.695
and doing it well,
that helped him.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.497
He started to get better.

35:36.499 --> 35:39.533
But then...
when we came up

35:39.535 --> 35:43.037
on the 20th anniversary
of Leah's death...

35:43.039 --> 35:45.039
he started to
slip away again.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.406
We tried everything:

35:46.408 --> 35:48.926
all kinds of therapy,
antidepressants...

35:48.928 --> 35:50.844
none of it helped.

35:50.846 --> 35:52.429
And a few months ago,

35:52.431 --> 35:56.550
I came home... and I
found him with a gun.

35:56.552 --> 36:00.220
He had already written me
a note saying good-bye.

36:00.222 --> 36:03.273
I talked him down,
but I knew

36:03.275 --> 36:05.142
it was just going
to be a matter of time

36:05.167 --> 36:07.167
before he tried again.

36:07.596 --> 36:10.147
I had to do something.

36:10.149 --> 36:12.783
He looked enough like
the sketch to fool Daren.

36:12.785 --> 36:14.151
That combined
with your insistence

36:14.153 --> 36:16.153
that it was the same man
was all it took.

36:16.155 --> 36:18.739
This was the only
way to save Daren.

36:18.741 --> 36:22.042
No, that's what 72-hour
psych holds are for.

36:22.044 --> 36:24.495
Rourke was an innocent man.

36:24.497 --> 36:26.380
I didn't relish
Mr. Rourke's death,

36:26.382 --> 36:31.218
but between him and Daren,
it wasn't a hard choice.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.087
Neither is this:

36:33.089 --> 36:34.755
You're under arrest.

36:38.059 --> 36:39.845
So now that we have
the whole truth,

36:39.870 --> 36:41.295
why do I feel so lousy?

36:41.296 --> 36:42.846
That's Moriarty's
intention.

36:42.848 --> 36:45.799
I think this is supposed
to be a stupid lesson.

36:45.801 --> 36:47.901
Show me a man
who craves vengeance

36:47.903 --> 36:50.020
and can destroy
the lives of others.

36:50.022 --> 36:54.191
You think this is his way
of getting you to back off?

36:54.193 --> 36:56.977
I think I'm gonna go
and visit Daren Sutter again.

36:56.979 --> 36:59.163
I feel an obligation
to break the news

36:59.165 --> 37:01.615
of his wife's
deceit personally.

37:01.617 --> 37:03.984
I'll meet you back
at the brownstone.

37:03.986 --> 37:06.787
<i>Uh, I'm just curious</i>

37:06.789 --> 37:09.322
why you're the one
telling me all this.

37:09.324 --> 37:11.491
I thought you deserved to know.

37:11.493 --> 37:14.661
You said you understood me.

37:14.663 --> 37:17.297
You experienced loss,
too, but what,

37:17.299 --> 37:20.517
you couldn't wait
for... one more night?

37:20.519 --> 37:23.353
After I suffered
through 22 years?

37:23.355 --> 37:25.189
I'll delve into Leah's case.

37:25.191 --> 37:28.892
I'll do everything possible
to bring her killer to justice.

37:28.894 --> 37:31.011
Wow, you still
don't get it, do you?

37:31.013 --> 37:33.897
Unless you plan on finding
the man who murdered my sister

37:33.899 --> 37:37.117
and bringing him back here
to me so I can strangle him

37:37.119 --> 37:40.003
with my own hands, there's
never gonna be any justice.

37:40.005 --> 37:42.914
<i>I've just been informed</i>

37:42.939 --> 37:44.324
<i>of Mrs. Sutter's arrest.</i>

37:45.049 --> 37:47.295
Finally,
you've earned your answers.

37:47.296 --> 37:49.663
I don't suppose I could convince
you to deliver them in person?

37:49.665 --> 37:52.199
The truth, Holmes,
is that I hope we never meet.

37:52.201 --> 37:54.201
My sense is that
would be a great shame.

37:54.203 --> 37:55.302
Mm, for once of us.

37:55.304 --> 37:57.871
My point.
We can end this now.

37:57.873 --> 38:01.175
I can promise you our paths
will never cross again.

38:01.177 --> 38:03.677
Or, you may have your answers.

38:03.679 --> 38:06.063
I'm curious to see
which you choose.

38:14.122 --> 38:16.089
Watson.

38:16.091 --> 38:18.892
Just checking in.
How did Daren take the news?

38:18.894 --> 38:20.727
As well as can be expected.

38:20.729 --> 38:22.579
Have you heard anything
from Moriarty yet?

38:22.581 --> 38:23.914
No, afraid not.

38:23.916 --> 38:25.232
I'm returning home.

38:25.234 --> 38:26.783
I'll be there shortly.

38:48.756 --> 38:52.259
What do you
think's inside?

38:52.261 --> 38:54.261
In this day and age,
the simplest way

38:54.263 --> 38:56.146
to track someone
is via their cell phone.

38:56.148 --> 38:59.616
You cloned the phone that
Moriarty's been using to contact us.

38:59.618 --> 39:02.435
I did.
Right after you told me

39:02.437 --> 39:04.738
that you'd never
let Moriarty hurt me.

39:04.740 --> 39:07.407
I thought you'd try and pull
something like this.

39:07.409 --> 39:09.960
You asked <i>me</i>
to be <i>your</i> partner.

39:09.962 --> 39:10.976
You are my partner.

39:11.001 --> 39:12.080
You lied to me
about hearing from Moriarty

39:12.081 --> 39:14.081
so you could
come here on your own.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.299
Watson...

39:18.219 --> 39:20.003
...most puzzles I see
from the outside

39:20.005 --> 39:21.722
and it gives me
a certain clarity.

39:21.724 --> 39:24.224
I am right in the
center of this one.

39:24.226 --> 39:28.145
It has blurred my vision...
to say the least.

39:28.147 --> 39:30.430
I just... I just
lied to protect you.

39:30.432 --> 39:32.132
I didn't ask you
to protect me.

39:32.134 --> 39:34.801
And I did not sign on
to work with you

39:34.803 --> 39:37.070
to be put on the sidelines
every time you or-or Gregson

39:37.072 --> 39:38.999
or anyone decides
it's too dangerous.

39:39.024 --> 39:39.741
You want the danger.

39:39.742 --> 39:41.570
No, I want to know
that I'm not kidding

39:41.595 --> 39:43.027
myself by staying with you.

39:43.028 --> 39:47.030
The reasons I'm
here are personal.

39:47.032 --> 39:49.816
I could say the same thing.

39:51.252 --> 39:53.486
I have been with you
every step of the way

39:53.488 --> 39:55.088
these past couple of weeks.

39:55.090 --> 39:56.840
We have worked hard
on this case.

39:56.842 --> 39:59.009
Whatever answers he's got
in there for you,

39:59.011 --> 40:00.544
I deserve them, too.
