WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:06.391
Yes, I promise I will call you
as soon as I get the results.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.838
Yes, I am aware that hospitals are a
hotbed of infection. Thank you, Manny.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.197
A couple of weeks ago,
I had a minor heart incident. I am fine.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.351
But just to be safe,
I'm having an angiogram,

00:16.440 --> 00:19.478
which is when they inject a dye
to make sure there's no blockage.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.040
It's-It's no big deal.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.674
We're not worried.
No.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.589
If something were to happen,
which it's not-Not gonna.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.832
I would turn our bedroom
into a shrine to Claire.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.354
Wow.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.353
And this room
into a hall of magic.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.716
Luke, please stop
taking appliances apart.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.877
I'm making something.
You're unmaking something.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.196
'Cause I'm giving my notice today.
Wait. What?

00:41.280 --> 00:43.670
But wouldn't we rather have toast
that's already buttered?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.797
I love that you're asking
these kinds of questions.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.951
If only the springs
were stronger,

00:48.040 --> 00:50.714
the toast would be catapulted
into the pool of butter.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.032
Really strong springs,
like the ones in your mattress?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.634
You're unbelievable.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.234
What do you
mean, you're quitting?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.880
Your manager just started letting you
open and close the store.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.474
It's boring.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.836
And Jennifer said that I could
get a job at the jewelry store.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.709
Honey, you need to learn to stick with things.
You just got the big keys.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.280
Where's the coffeepot?

01:09.360 --> 01:10.840
You mean
the soon-to-be coffee-bot?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.400
Luke!
I need caffeine today.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.393
You can have juice. How late were
you at that party last night?

01:15.480 --> 01:17.437
Oh, please.
She snuck in at 10:00...

01:17.520 --> 01:20.080
and spent all night reading
under the covers with a flashlight.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.755
Alex, what have I told you
about staying out past your curfew?

01:22.880 --> 01:25.236
I need to do it more often.
Exactly.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.993
You need to learn
to have some fun.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.630
You are going on
that spring break trip with Nicole.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.189
No! No, I can't.
I have to study for the P.S.A.T.'s.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.079
Luke! Phil, talk to your children.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.714
All right.
Everybody listen up.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.280
Haley, you're not quitting.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.840
You're resigning.
It sounds better.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.389
- No. Uh-uh.
- Alex, you have all of spring break...

01:43.480 --> 01:45.233
to lock yourself
in your room and study.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.239
No, no, no, no, no. And, Luke,
coffee-bot is a non-starter.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.552
But I do like the idea of popcorn
kernels in the pancake batter...

01:51.680 --> 01:53.592
so they self-flip.
Stop talking!

01:53.680 --> 01:55.512
Step away from the children.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.016
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:04.320 --> 02:05.515
♪ Hey♪ ♪

02:11.760 --> 02:14.798
¿ Quién es el hombre
más herm oso de esta casa?

02:14.880 --> 02:17.952
Ah, perdón. ¿ Quién esel otro hombre
más herm oso de esta casa?

02:18.040 --> 02:19.679
- Manny?
- Huh?

02:19.800 --> 02:21.757
I am telling you how
handsome you are. Oh.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.797
Well, next time, tell me in
English so I don't miss it.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.714
You're forgetting all your Spanish.
You never practice.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.360
Perdóneme, mami.
Soy embarazada.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.511
You just told me that you're pregnant.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.637
Congratulations. You're glowing.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.279
Really?
That's what you're wearing?

02:35.360 --> 02:37.272
Really? That's how
you talk to your meal ticket?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.317
Besides, those snobs
don't care what I wear...

02:39.400 --> 02:41.676
as long as I bring my checkbook.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.036
Today I have an interview
with the Dryden Academy.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.555
It's only the most prestigious
prep school around.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.951
Their school song has 36 verses,
and I know all of 'em.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.679
Settle in.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.750
Oh

02:52.840 --> 02:55.230
And the reason
you're not bringing him?

02:55.360 --> 02:58.273
He says that I make him nervous,
that I care too much.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.717
That's why I'm not even allowed
to bring him to his haircuts anymore.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.950
I never went to private school.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.470
Hell, I never even finished college,
and look at me.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.598
That Danish I just ate cost six bucks.
I didn't even blink.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.195
I've always felt out of place
in public school,

03:13.280 --> 03:15.636
like a lone petunia
in an onion patch.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.189
You felt out of place.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.159
Let me tell you something
about your prep school buddies.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.790
When I was younger, I had a job
checking coats at a country club.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.917
These smug rich kids
used to waltz in there...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.071
and throw their coats at me
like I was nothing.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.517
That was before your high-tech fabrics.
They weighed a ton.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.671
- You see that scar?
- The one you got in the war?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.592
That's what I tell people.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.717
I caught the scalloped edge...

03:38.800 --> 03:41.952
of a Burberry duffel coat toggle.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.191
Still not sure
there isn't a piece in there.

03:46.280 --> 03:50.593
Kids will always wanna quit when
things get hard if you let 'em.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.559
This is a girl
who was kicked out of college.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.280
The least she can do is stick
it out at a little-Hey, Phil.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.115
Sorry. Look, all we can do is give
Haley the time to find out who she is.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.560
Or we could save that time, and
I could tell her who she is.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.359
Let me know
how that works out.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.199
Excuse me?
Oh, sorry.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.840
But my TV doesn't work,
and you're all I've got.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.519
I'm Norman.
Good to meet you, Norman.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.393
What are you in for?
Triple bypass.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.320
Awesome. And it sounded like you were
agreeing with my parenting style,

04:15.440 --> 04:17.397
so please, continue.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.914
I've raised three kids,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.596
and the main thing I learned is you
have to let them be who they are.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.319
Thank you, Norman.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.800
Just because he's behind a curtain
doesn't make him a wizard.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.153
Dad, I made you this necklace.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.800
- It's good for healing.
- There's no scientific evidence to back that up, Dad.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.276
I married a doctor.
I have three degrees.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.919
Girls, where's
your little brother?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.754
He didn't get his arm stuck in a
vending machine again, did he?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.081
Are you getting this? Yes.
They sound just like our kids,

04:43.120 --> 04:45.200
and they all got together
to visit their dad. Mm-hmm.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.240
Who apparently did
a pretty good job raising them.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.352
Please. He sounds like an old hippie.
A wise, insightful, old hippie.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.914
Mm-hmm.
A Jeff Bridges hippie.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.759
Hey, Dad. There he is.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.479
Look at that sharp suit.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.597
Oh, my God, Luke gets huge.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.637
You've seen this.
I wore it to Angela's wedding.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.157
Oh, yeah. It's just like the one I
had made for my little Jonathan.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.512
- Okay, Mrs. Dunphy. Time for your prep.
- Okay.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.638
See what happens
when parents get out of the way?

05:09.720 --> 05:12.110
Weddings, babies, sharp suits.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.954
You might wanna wheel her by the burn unit.
She just got scorched.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.876
Wait. You made a suit for Jonathan?
He's a cat.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.919
He's a hairless stray.
He needs the suit for warmth-

05:23.000 --> 05:26.232
you know, that thing all of your husbands
eventually stop feeling for you.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.880
I did not come here to be insulted.
I came here for Dad.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.680
Dad, I need $500.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.514
How can you need money?
You have four divorce settlements.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.434
Yeah, sorry I'm not
some sad, lonely exorcist.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.637
Archivist.
I'm an archivist.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.154
This arguing.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.038
I might as well
have just stayed in court.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.834
- Please be a lawyer. Please be a lawyer.
- How'd it go?

05:45.920 --> 05:48.151
I got probation
plus time served. Suck it.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.632
Maybe now you'll stop siphoning
electricity off the grid with a meat hook.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.279
Hey, look at me for a second.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.751
When you die alone in your bed,
Jonathan's going to eat you.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.874
Yep.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.391
Lily! Time for girls' day!

06:05.480 --> 06:09.110
We've always tried to make sure that Lily
has a feminine influence in her life.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.476
Because I'm sure
it is so difficult...

06:11.600 --> 06:14.877
for her to be around so much
masculine energy all the time.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.199
Yeah. And recently, uh, she's been asking
a lot of questions about the female body.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.794
And-

06:20.880 --> 06:24.430
Uh, we are not exactly experts,
so we'd-Just sit on 'em.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.512
We decided to call in
the big guns.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.636
Hola.
Hi, Gloria!

06:29.720 --> 06:31.234
Lily is so excited
for girls' day.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.720
But don't keep her
all afternoon.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.354
You know how we miss her. Okay.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.592
When am I going to get
real boobs?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.353
Okay.
So we'll see you whenever.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.951
Absolutely. Just have a really great time.
Vamos, mami. Vamos.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.350
So we'll do a little shopping.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.877
We can have our pretty nails
done and our pretty hair.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.560
Do you think that's fun?
Yeah!

06:51.680 --> 06:55.469
And you know what the best part
of having a girls' day is?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.751
That you can ask me
anything you want.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.832
Did you know I'm gay?

07:07.760 --> 07:11.037
This is lucky. At 2:00, the school's
award-winning bell players...

07:11.120 --> 07:14.033
will be performing a medley
of Civil War drinking songs.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.432
What do they call that? Unhappy hour?
Hmm. Interesting.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.957
This was an all-boys academy
when it was established in 1901.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.000
Thank God they went away
from that tradition, huh?

07:23.080 --> 07:25.959
Yeah. I bet the place is one
giant orgy now. Jay, please.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.681
- Hey, do you wanna grab a coat?
- Grab your own coat, college boy.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.271
Uh, I meant for you. They want us all
to wear a school blazer for the tour,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.079
get the whole
Dryden experience.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.391
Right. I-I'm sorry, buddy.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.200
Hello, parents, prospective Norsemen.
Welcome.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.237
Our tour will begin
in this direction...

07:41.320 --> 07:43.755
with a view of our renowned
equestrian center.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.230
Ooh!

07:46.360 --> 07:48.113
It took me right back
to 40 years ago-

07:48.200 --> 07:50.920
candy-ass preppies
with too many privileges.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.435
You know what I hated most
about those guys?

07:53.520 --> 07:55.796
They all had
these little noses.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.360
What is that?

07:57.440 --> 08:00.558
To your left, the world-class
Campbell Observatory.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.633
Now, of course, if it's stars
of the Hollywood kind that you like,

08:03.720 --> 08:05.677
our award-winning theater
is just here,

08:05.760 --> 08:09.549
where this June, Ms. Nicole Kidman
will be appearing in Picnic.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.479
Okay, gun to my head?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.712
Maybe I was a tiny bit jealous
of those guys back then,

08:16.800 --> 08:19.838
with their cars
and their fancy hair products-

08:19.920 --> 08:23.516
your Brylcreems and your VO5's.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.592
We'll now take a short break,
where you're free to explore...

08:25.680 --> 08:28.798
the treasures
of our rare book library.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.880
You know what was a rare book
in my school library?

08:30.960 --> 08:33.953
One that didn't have genitals
drawn all over it.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.599
Who am I kidding?

08:35.679 --> 08:37.717
I wanted
what those kids had then,

08:37.799 --> 08:41.032
and 40 years later,
I still wanted it.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.080
Manny, write down what they
said about the library.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.032
They're liable to ask you
about that in the interview.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.191
And get the lead out. We don't
wanna miss the bell players.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.600
Excuse me.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.672
But she's so young.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.560
Do you really think that she
already-I knew when I was five.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.393
- Everybody knew when you were five.
- Not true.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.201
Not everyone knew until I threw myself
my second fifth birthday party.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.438
Come on. Lily is not gay.
It's probably just a phase.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.358
Oh, my God.
Did I just say that?

09:03.480 --> 09:05.517
Do not tell anyone
I just said that.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.671
I got my sweater.
Can I go now?

09:07.760 --> 09:09.194
Here. Yeah, sweetie.
Have a seat.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.795
Oh. If this was a hay bale
and she was wearing a prairie skirt,

09:11.880 --> 09:13.394
it would be a total flashback.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.914
Stay with us.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.435
So Gloria was telling us about
something that you said.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.954
Something about you being gay?

09:19.120 --> 09:21.555
What about it? Okay, very aggressive.
Just saying.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.758
We're just wondering,
you know, why did you say that?

09:24.840 --> 09:27.958
- Because I'm gay.
- But why do you think you're gay, sweetie?

09:28.040 --> 09:30.919
- We're learning about it in school.
- Oh.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.072
My friend Aldo's parents
are Italian, so he's Italian.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.073
And you and Daddy are gay,
so I'm gay.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.356
Oh!

09:39.440 --> 09:42.274
First of all, adorable.
But that's not how it works.

09:42.360 --> 09:46.912
When Aldo's talking about him being
Italian, he's talking about his heritage.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.640
Yeah, and that's a totally
different thing than being gay.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.679
See, heritage is, uh-Well, it's
something that you're born with.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.399
And-Oh, my God.
What's wrong with me?

09:54.480 --> 09:57.678
And with respect
to your heritage, you're not gay.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.274
You're Vietnamese.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.354
- What's that?
- Well, Vietnam is a beautiful country,

10:03.440 --> 10:05.909
and it's near China.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.350
Uh, it-
it's known for, uh,

10:08.440 --> 10:10.477
its-its farms,
with all of the, uh-

10:10.560 --> 10:12.074
Um-

10:12.160 --> 10:13.594
Uh, water buffalo.
Water buffalo.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.592
Uh, bikes. Lily,
there are bikes ever here.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.559
Oh! There are so many bikes.
So many bikes.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.200
People are biking around.
Mm-hmm.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.959
And then-And they're wearing hats.
Hats.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.921
They have these beautiful sun hats.
That swoop.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.032
Yeah. Can
I go and play now?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.197
Please. Go. Yes.
Yes, gosh. Would ya?

10:28.280 --> 10:30.192
Love for you to.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.953
Is that all you know
about her culture?

10:32.040 --> 10:36.273
No. We're saving some of the things
until she gets older to tell her about-

10:36.400 --> 10:38.437
I wanna say the windmills
and the tulips. Don't.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.398
No wonder she has
so many questions.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.039
She doesn't know who she is.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.801
I guess we kind of dropped the ball.
Yeah.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.593
You know what?
Forget the pretty nails.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.831
We are all going to
a Vietnamese restaurant...

10:47.920 --> 10:50.674
and we are gonna give her
a taste of her culture.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.719
Which one is the best
restaurant around here?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.152
I wanna say Saigon-
There's Little, um-

10:57.240 --> 10:59.391
You know nothing.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.870
I'll look in the Yelp.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.798
Thank you.
You're welcome.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.712
Hey, we should go.
Mom's gonna be here soon.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.156
Why don't you stay and say hello?
She'd love to see you.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.481
Why? So she can
tell me how to live my life?

11:10.520 --> 11:12.716
Yeah, I've got my
probation officer for that.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.235
We'll see her on her birthday.
When's the next important one?

11:15.360 --> 11:17.431
Um-

11:17.520 --> 11:19.159
I know it's none
of my business,

11:19.280 --> 11:21.351
but is it possible that
your mom doesn't want you...

11:21.440 --> 11:23.750
to make certain mistakes
'cause she cares?

11:23.880 --> 11:26.076
Oh, my God. You sound just like her.
Let's roll.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.795
Haley, you are not
quitting your job.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.593
Where is this coming from?

11:33.680 --> 11:36.120
It's coming from the future, your
future, and it ain't pretty.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.795
I don't understand.
In the future, I'm not pretty?

11:38.880 --> 11:40.681
No, you hold up okay.
But this path you're on-

11:40.760 --> 11:42.194
flitting from one thing
to the next-

11:42.280 --> 11:44.078
It ends in a pile of ex-husbands
and nicotine fingers.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.192
Can I talk now, Dad?

11:46.280 --> 11:47.760
No!
Hello?

11:47.840 --> 11:50.355
Alex? You don't have to go
on that trip with Nicole.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.551
You can study
as much as you want.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.394
- Just know that I love you.
- Okay.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.960
Listen to me, Haley.
You are dangerously close...

11:57.040 --> 11:58.838
to getting on a path
you can't get off of.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.156
Dad, stop yelling.
Mom, stop crying.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.397
I know I'm not a big nerd.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.721
Here. Mom wants to talk to you.
Dad wants to talk to you.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.240
Hello?

12:07.320 --> 12:10.119
Alex, book down,
run a brush through your hair.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.880
You're going on that trip
with your friend.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.600
What?
Haley, I love you.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.320
If you don't wanna work in that store, I'll
help you find something you like better.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.153
Is this reverse psychiatry?

12:19.240 --> 12:21.675
No, honey.
Actually, nothing is.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.678
I just want you to be happy.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.240
Mom, you're freaking me out.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.800
Why is everyone screaming?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.360
Here!

12:28.440 --> 12:29.874
This is Luke.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.872
Why are Mom and Dad
acting so crazy?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.429
I don't know, but it's creepy.
Something's going on.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.440
Do you think it has to do
with Mom's heart thing?

12:36.480 --> 12:37.994
Like it's more serious
than they're saying?

12:38.120 --> 12:40.589
We have to go to the hospital.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

12:40.680 --> 12:43.275
Okay, everybody, calm down.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.919
Here's what we know.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.560
Mom had to go to the hospital
for a simple procedure.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.633
Then Mom and Dad
start calling us, acting weird.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.393
Open your eyes, people.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.312
They've been kidnapped.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.834
Well, now that the tour's over,
we can probably take these off.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.400
I don't see the rush.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.711
And you gotta be mentally sharp
for your interview.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.036
How you feeling?
Pretty good.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.794
Parents are allowed to sit in,
but if you don't feel like it-

13:09.880 --> 13:11.439
Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't miss it.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.313
This is
where it all starts.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.520
Sure seems like you've come
around on this place, Jay.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.519
How could I not?
This place is unbelievable.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.114
I'm already picturing
those jerks at the club...

13:20.200 --> 13:22.840
seeing my son walk in
wearing a Dryden jacket.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.071
Manny Delgado?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.359
I- I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

13:29.440 --> 13:31.318
I like books for reading them.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.796
You care to elaborate?
Indeed.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.830
Did you ever see one
of those slow-motion movies...

13:40.920 --> 13:44.880
where they destroy an old
casino and it just implodes?

13:46.240 --> 13:47.435
That.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.632
So, who are your favorite authors?
That's a long list.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.111
I'd probably have
to start with, uh-

13:54.200 --> 13:56.590
Go ahead.
Hard as you can.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.434
Mmm! So good.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.797
- I want a cheeseburger.
- But this is a special soup called pho.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.076
You told me
not to say that word.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.154
It is delicious. This is
the food of your people.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.799
Can I get
you anything else?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.641
Actually, we're just trying to teach
our daughter about your country.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.951
And as I'm saying that,
I'm hoping you're from Vietnam.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.396
I was born there.
So was Lily.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.314
Oh, it's a beautiful country.
Uh, my family still lives there.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.800
I hate Vietnam!

14:30.880 --> 14:32.519
Lily,
honey, we don't hate.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.950
I hate Vietnam.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.999
Okay, um,
we need just a second.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.634
Lily, that was rude.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.200
I wanna go home.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.511
No. It's important
that you celebrate...

14:43.600 --> 14:45.432
the culture of your ancestors.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.079
You are Vietnamese.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.278
No, I'm not. I'm gay! I'm gay!

14:50.360 --> 14:52.716
Honey, no, you're not gay.
You are just confused.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.190
Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?
It's like I-

14:55.280 --> 14:57.033
Oh, please.
We have tons of lesbian friends.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.391
Odd that you would reference
our friends and not us.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.193
Also gay.
We should just go.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.749
No, nobody's going anywhere
until she finishes the whole soup!

15:03.880 --> 15:06.395
- No, Gloria, it's fine. We don't wanna push her.
- No, no, no, it's not fine.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.320
That's the problem with this country.
Nobody cares where they come from.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.920
They just want cheeseburgers
and prep school,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.595
and they have forgotten
about Colombia!

15:14.680 --> 15:18.310
Okay, I can't help but feel that maybe
you're bringing something to the table...

15:18.400 --> 15:21.916
that's possibly, uh,
not at all about Lily.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.593
I think you're right.

15:23.680 --> 15:28.596
It's just that I feel like
I'm losing my children to America.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.435
They're just going to grow up
and become boring old white people.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.911
Uh, most of our friends
are white, actually.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.480
Okay, can everybody
just calm down...

15:37.560 --> 15:39.279
and go back
to their own conversations?

15:39.360 --> 15:43.320
- Just-Thank you.
- Hey. Hey, what's going on with you?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.750
Manny has forgotten
most of his Spanish,

15:46.880 --> 15:49.270
and Joe-I'm sure he's not
even going to learn it.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.478
I know this is silly,
but I just don't like feeling...

15:52.560 --> 15:55.519
like I'm so different
from the rest of my family.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.677
- Oh, honey.
- It feels so lonely, yes.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.275
Oh, wait just a second. Lily,
is that why you wanna be gay-

16:00.360 --> 16:01.874
to be more like your daddies?

16:01.960 --> 16:04.680
Oh, honey.
No, the three of us are a family...

16:04.760 --> 16:06.558
even though we come
from different places.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.872
You know, you were born in
Vietnam, and I grew up in a city.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.475
And even though he never talks about
it, your daddy grew up on a farm.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.880
Yeah.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.600
The point is that we're a family
because we love each other.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.160
Okay.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.709
And you know what? You just
caused a scene in a restaurant,

16:20.800 --> 16:23.235
and you can't get any more
like your daddies than that.

16:23.320 --> 16:27.155
Maybe I'll just take Manny
and Joe to Colombia this summer.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.720
I think that's a great idea.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.957
I really think that keeping
in touch with your heritage...

16:31.040 --> 16:33.157
only enriches our culture.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.471
Absolutely. I think we
would all be better off...

16:35.560 --> 16:38.314
if people would go back
to where they came from.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.080
I-

16:43.160 --> 16:45.152
I'll pull the car around.
Yes.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.635
All I can think about are
the good times I had with Mom.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.991
Who's gonna walk me down the aisle?
Stop spinning out.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.117
There's no point in imagining
some horrible future.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.557
Hey.
Mmm.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.680
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.273
You made it.
Mm-hmm.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.357
You're in heaven.
That's not funny.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.954
Okay.
Knock, knock.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.720
Don't bother. She's not in the mood for jokes.
Your results are great.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.678
Minimal plaque.
Your heart is strong.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.991
Oh. Thank you.
That's such good news.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.878
Well, keep taking your medication,
you'll outlive all of us.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.513
Thanks.
Honey, you nailed it.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.955
Mmm. You weren't worried,
were you?

17:28.079 --> 17:30.959
No.
Mmm. Me neither.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.156
I wasn't done with that.
Me neither.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.915
Hmm.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.595
God, do you soak your hair
in cigarettes?

17:39.720 --> 17:41.677
Do you
wash your clothes in tears?

17:41.760 --> 17:44.639
I have to get home. My
roommate needs these shoes.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.234
Weirdos.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.391
Luke, don't be so mean.
I can't take it today.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.073
I may be your sort of mom now,

17:50.160 --> 17:51.640
and I'm practically
a child myself.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.872
Okay, let's calm down.
Mom could be fine.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.201
Come on. They wouldn't be
freaking out if they were fine.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.112
Right, 'cause Mom and Dad
never freak out over nothing.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.396
They don't.
They're perfect.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.711
Remember the time
when Dad was switching jobs...

18:03.800 --> 18:05.361
and Mom threw away
all of our junk food?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.910
That was completely different.
No, no, actually, it's not.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.879
They don't know how to deal with
their stuff, so they obsess over us.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.634
Maybe that's all this is,
right?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.598
I can't believe
how relieved I am.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.876
Me too.
I'm just texting the kids.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.191
It's like at a certain age,
"It's probably nothing"...

18:20.280 --> 18:22.715
becomes
"It's probably nothing."

18:22.800 --> 18:24.951
Like they add italics at 40.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.316
Well, the good news is-
Mmm.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.996
These situations just bring us
closer and closer together.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.560
Hmm.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.720
By the way, you did a great job
of keeping your cool.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.991
Well, I didn't wanna
scare the kids.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.639
You did a pretty
good job yourself.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.234
Thanks.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.431
I have a secret.
What's that?

18:42.520 --> 18:44.160
We're pretty good
at this parenting thing.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.833
I think we are.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.714
Kiss me.
I'm gonna try.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.273
"Mom okay"? You guys are
the worst parents ever.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.119
It's the same every time.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.237
One of you guys goes
through something stressful,

18:57.320 --> 18:59.232
and instead of dealing with it,
you freak out on us.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.879
"Quit your job,
don't quit your job"?

19:00.960 --> 19:02.440
"Read more, read less"?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.950
Be better at being adults.
Come on, Luke. Let's go.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.993
You're not my
mom anymore, but okay!

19:10.240 --> 19:12.709
Save the judgy looks
for another 15 years.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.154
What the hell happened
in there?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.516
I don't know. I've never
choked like that before.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.193
You think it's a definite no?

19:23.280 --> 19:26.432
You pointed to a picture of the
dean's son and asked when she's due.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.995
Right.
Sorry I let you down, Jay.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.794
Me? I saw how much
it meant to you.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.360
It's like I was
on the football field.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.558
You were up in the stands,
all proud of me, rooting me on.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.077
I'm not used to that.
I just whiffed.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.198
That's not even the right sport.
Why am I trying to blame you?

19:43.280 --> 19:45.431
Probably 'cause you should be.
Sit down.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.511
I think I put
some stuff on you...

19:48.600 --> 19:52.037
that is about
some guys 40 years ago...

19:52.120 --> 19:55.158
with tiny noses
and perfect hair.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.550
You're losing me.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.712
There's only one thing
I want you to understand.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.396
If today was the first time you've
felt that I was proud of you,

20:04.480 --> 20:06.517
then I should be apologizing,

20:06.640 --> 20:08.916
'cause I'm proud of you
every day.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.276
Thanks, Jay.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.033
Let's go.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.760
Did I really bet him I could fit
his whole cell phone in my mouth?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.559
Forget about that guy. You're
never gonna see him again.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.120
I'm not sure about that.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.835
Wait here.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.514
Kernels in? Check.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.393
On the right side only?
Check.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.233
You know this is the last
of our batter, right?

20:32.320 --> 20:33.754
Our backs are against the wall.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.230
Last chance at mastering
the self-flipping pancake.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.750
You mean "popcake."
I was thinking "flipjack."

20:38.920 --> 20:41.151
Oh, of course!
It's okay.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.199
Okay.
This is the one. I feel it.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.158
If this works,
centuries from now,

20:46.240 --> 20:47.799
someone's gonna dig
one of these things up...

20:47.880 --> 20:49.872
and wonder what the heck it is.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.357
Five, four,

20:53.480 --> 20:55.437
three, two-

20:55.520 --> 20:57.557
Flip!

20:57.680 --> 21:00.400
Flip, damn you!
It's over.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.910
No, it's not!
It's over!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.480
It's all right.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.314
We left it all out there
on the griddle.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.198
We live to fight another day.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.760
Yeah. I guess.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.196
I can't believe we wasted
all that batter.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.640
I guess you can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.478
Am I right?

21:17.560 --> 21:19.074
Or can we?

21:19.160 --> 21:21.436
To the grocery store.
