08:45.567 --> 08:47.610
If eight years of private school
taught me anything,

08:47.694 --> 08:49.529
it's that you got to join 'em early.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.156
Besides, they mean well.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.533

That's next month. [laughs]

10:11.194 --> 10:12.320
[pop music playing]

10:12.403 --> 10:14.906
Gloria Steinem would be rolling over
in her grave

10:14.989 --> 10:16.241
if she saw us here.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.827
Gloria Steinem isn't dead.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.453
[sighs]

10:20.537 --> 10:22.705
Okay, well, what else
were we supposed to do?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.165
Open-mic night?

10:24.249 --> 10:26.000
You want to play darts in the lounge?

10:26.084 --> 10:29.462
Everything we do is on the off chance
it'll help us get laid by a guy

10:29.546 --> 10:31.965
who might make one of us
First fucking Lady someday

10:32.048 --> 10:33.675
so we actually have a shot
at leaving our mark

10:33.758 --> 10:35.510
on this ass-backwards, patriarchal,

10:35.593 --> 10:38.179
corporate republic we call a country.

10:39.514 --> 10:43.434
I took 60 milligrams of Adderall,
but I promise I'm gonna be fine. I just--

10:43.518 --> 10:45.019
I think my heart might explode.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.479
Pull it together, Muffy.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.065
-Okay.
-[man] Hey, you.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.153
Let's go.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.029
Muffy's a low-key freak, y'all.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.823
Yeah, well, I'm a high-key freak,

10:56.906 --> 10:58.950
and I need to get some tonight.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.744
And I broke Idris.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.371
[laughs]

11:09.169 --> 11:11.087
[man] You waiting for me?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.505
Ready?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.886
[man] Hey. Allow me.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.403
Worst night ever.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.780
I know.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.324
It's on every network.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.409
Wait, what? How is that possible?

11:41.492 --> 11:44.537
<i>If you're just tuning in,</i>
<i>again, there will be no indictments</i>

11:44.621 --> 11:46.581
<i>for Officer Stevens and Lieutenant Smith</i>

11:46.664 --> 11:49.918
<i>in the shooting death</i>
<i>of 17-year-old Caleb Jones.</i>

11:50.001 --> 11:53.296
<i>Now, Jones had been stopped</i>
<i>by Stevens and Smith allegedly...</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:54.631
They can't keep doing this to us.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.050
Turn that off.
How can you watch this shit?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.593
[man] <i>As it turns out...</i>

11:58.676 --> 12:01.888
I know it's graphic,
but we got to stay woke.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.806
We can't put our heads in the sand.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.559
I was born woke, Sam.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.061
The shit I saw growing up...

12:08.645 --> 12:10.230
<i>In addition to that, the police chief,</i>

12:10.313 --> 12:12.023
<i>Peter Austin, now claiming</i>
<i>that his officers</i>

12:12.106 --> 12:15.068
<i>found traces of marijuana</i>
<i>in Jones' jeans pocket.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:16.444
Of course they did.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.363
And therefore he deserved to die.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.864
I just can't.

12:19.948 --> 12:23.576
[man continues speaking]

12:28.581 --> 12:30.917
[woman] <i>I don't know, guys.</i>
<i>So what do you want to do?</i>

12:31.000 --> 12:34.796
Boycott our classes,
a hunger strike, a sit-in?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.673
These people have convinced themselves

12:36.756 --> 12:39.425
that a sleepover in the president's office

12:39.509 --> 12:41.469
is going to help Caleb Jones.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.847
How do you know it won't?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.560
Uh...

12:49.644 --> 12:51.354
Hey. Hi.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.106
I'm Sam.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.483
A freshman.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.987
Look, I know we all feel

12:59.070 --> 13:01.197
a little hopeless,

13:01.280 --> 13:02.865
at least I do.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.576
I feel a million miles away from Caleb.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.453
But, y'all,
that could have been any of us.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.665
These aren't freak incidents.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.876
They happen way too often
for us to not do more.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.088
[fingers snapping]

13:17.171 --> 13:19.132
No matter their color, kids at Winchester

13:19.215 --> 13:22.593
don't think things like this
have anything to do with them.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.930
But we have a responsibility
to make them see it does.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.600
Maybe.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.689
-[applause]
-[clamoring]

13:39.152 --> 13:41.320
[Coco] It's still not gonna
change anything.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.905
[Sam] I wish you'd stop saying that.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.657
[Karen] Sam, is it?

13:44.741 --> 13:46.701
Nice little speech.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.828
And your hair, it's everything.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.079
Where'd you get it?

13:50.955 --> 13:51.873
My head.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.166
Bitch.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.292
Mine too.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.418
Obviously.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.794
What's up, ladies?

13:58.296 --> 14:00.089
What's up, Karen?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.926
Fuckboys. Am I right?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.636
-Everything you say is right.
-I guess.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.348
So... our Alpha Delta Rho
informational is this week.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.268
We're always looking for motivated,

14:12.351 --> 14:15.229
bright young ladies like yourselves.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.148
So better see you bad <i>chicas there.</i>

14:17.231 --> 14:19.317
Sounds good. Thanks for the invite.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.152
Sure thing. We'll be there.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.571
We will not be there.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.490
[gasps] Bitch, we're going.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.158
You're better than this.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.201
I am not.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.288
What I am is horny as fuck
and too cute to be this pressed.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.582
-Did you see Troy?
-You mean Clarence Thomas?

14:34.665 --> 14:36.542
He was under her spell.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.586
Whatever baby-nectar voodoo shit

14:38.669 --> 14:40.797
the Alpha Deltas are drinking, I want it.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.633
Can I throw shade the entire time?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.551
You can shade. You cannot read.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.471
Deal.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.889
[squeals] Thank you, thank you.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.599
-[kissing]
-Oh, oh.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.394
Now we got to do something about this.

14:56.020 --> 14:56.938
Ooh!

14:57.021 --> 14:57.939
Afro puffs.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.275
That wasn't a "no."

15:05.863 --> 15:07.365
Ow.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.700
Is this really what you want to do?

15:09.784 --> 15:10.868
[moans]

15:10.952 --> 15:12.286
Beauty is pain.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.164
Do you guys know what you're doing?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.041
Providing a public service.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.419
Where else you gonna
get your hair did around here?

15:19.502 --> 15:21.421
Yeah, black hair matters.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.506
What are your majors?

15:23.589 --> 15:24.799
Neurobiology.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.761
-And yours, Tanika?
-[coughs]

15:29.387 --> 15:33.141
Tanika dropped out last semester
and won't leave.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.852
-Ain't nobody talking to you, Abigail.
-[Coco moans]

15:35.935 --> 15:39.105
Two words-- traction alopecia.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.691
Sam, I love you,

15:42.525 --> 15:45.528
but this weave is going to change my life.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.072
[voice breaking]
Now shut up and hand me an Advil.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.575
Ow.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.411
Ow... ow, ow, ow, ow.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.495
[inhales sharply]

15:54.579 --> 15:55.872
[exhales deeply]

15:56.664 --> 15:58.541
Oh, you think this is funny, bitch?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.168
No, no.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.462
[laughs] A little.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.466
That Advil didn't work.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.760
You think I'll overdose
if I take the whole bottle?

16:10.344 --> 16:13.973
I look too cute to die tonight. [groans]

16:21.814 --> 16:23.691
[exhales deeply]

16:23.774 --> 16:25.318
[inhales deeply] Oh, yeah.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.944
Here...

16:27.028 --> 16:28.529
hit this.

16:28.613 --> 16:29.864
What is this?

16:29.947 --> 16:32.158
This is Goldie.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.203
Goldie, meet Coco.

16:35.286 --> 16:39.081
This is the answer to all
of your weave-related ailments.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.502
From me to my best friend.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.422
Girl, who sold you this?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.591
I don't feel anything.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.513
I feel everything.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.642
[sighs happily]

16:57.725 --> 16:59.644
[breathes deeply]

16:59.727 --> 17:03.481
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.024
This feels so good.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.150
[laughs] Shh.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.693
Keep it down.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.737
People gonna think we're scissor sisters.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.489
Mmm. [laughs]

17:11.572 --> 17:13.324
Wait, what have you heard?

17:13.407 --> 17:15.201
[laughing]

17:15.284 --> 17:19.539
The extraordinary women
of the Xi Lambda Chapter

17:19.622 --> 17:25.086
of Alpha Delta Rho Sorority Incorporated
aspire to have a positive impact

17:25.169 --> 17:27.171
on local low-income communities

17:27.255 --> 17:30.466
through tutoring, food banks

17:30.550 --> 17:32.510
and clothing drives.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.096
You see, what we want to do...

17:35.179 --> 17:37.515
You know the BSU does the same things,

17:37.598 --> 17:40.351
and we don't adhere
to regressive gender roles.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.979
[whispering]
The library's closed. Shade only.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.066
Oh, look...

17:47.149 --> 17:48.734
to serve the community with these girls,

17:48.818 --> 17:52.655
you only need to pay them
a $1,500 initiation fee.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.865
And what's the fee to get you
to shut the fuck up?

18:07.503 --> 18:10.256
Okay, we got to go in,
and we got to hit hard.

18:10.339 --> 18:14.302
You are the sorriest bunch
of pledges, I swear.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.678
And you...

18:17.013 --> 18:20.182
I gave you one job.

18:22.727 --> 18:27.106
What's listed for Coleman Lounge
for this Sunday at 3:00 p.m.?

18:27.189 --> 18:29.567
BSU fund-raiser.

18:29.650 --> 18:33.195
Shit, I made the request
for Coleman Hall not Coleman Lounge.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.656
Don't worry, Big Sister Too Fabulous,
I'll get it fixed.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.074
You're damn right you will.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.543
Sam, I need your help.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.212
Did you book Coleman Lounge for BSU?

18:50.296 --> 18:53.049
Yeah, we're raising money
for Caleb Jones' family.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.676
I was supposed to reserve it
for the Alpha Delta

18:55.760 --> 18:57.887
Sassy but Classy Etiquette Tea,
but I fucked up and--

18:57.970 --> 19:00.389
"Sassy but Classy"?
That is a terrible name.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.642
Could you possibly find another venue?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.519
We've already sold a bunch of tickets.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.521
And this is kind of my big project.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.774
Can't you have your sass-tea
somewhere else?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.359
Sassy but Classy.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.863
Look, the BSU wants to make a difference.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.698
We care about things like that.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.533
[Coco] Oh, we do?

19:19.617 --> 19:21.994
Because not that long ago,

19:22.078 --> 19:24.288
BSU didn't want you at their table.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.248
[sighs] You know what?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.958
I'm just trying to wake this campus up.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.461
Sweets, the oppressed
do not get their freedom

19:30.544 --> 19:33.047
by appealing to the morality
of their oppressor.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.925
Ever think of that?
Assata Shakur did, so boom.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.469
Don't Assata Shakur me.
I told you about Assata Shakur.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.012
And what would she say

19:40.096 --> 19:42.932
about you overdrawing your bank account
for a weave?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.433
You have a rat's nest on your head

19:44.517 --> 19:46.811
with a comb sticking out of it,
running around campus

19:46.894 --> 19:49.438
trying to be Miss Blackety Black-Black.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.232
I wanted an avant-garde look,
like Solange--

19:51.315 --> 19:52.733
something that says, "I'm woke,

19:52.817 --> 19:54.485
but I'll also kick your ass
in an elevator."

19:54.568 --> 19:56.821
Dear white people,
let me tell you about yourselves

19:56.904 --> 19:59.073
when I don't even know who the hell I am.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.450
Oh, I don't know who I am, Colandrea?

20:01.534 --> 20:04.120
No, you don't, but I do.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.998
You're the girl who didn't learn
she was black until Beth Wheeler

20:08.082 --> 20:10.626
left you out of her second-grade sleepover

20:10.710 --> 20:12.461
'cause you'd be "the only one."

20:12.545 --> 20:15.131
That is the last time I share
a personal story with you.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.259
Well, you see, with me,
there is no confusion.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.761
People take one look at my skin,

20:20.845 --> 20:24.974
and they assume that I'm poor
or uneducated or ratchet.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.101
So, yeah, I tone it down,

20:27.184 --> 20:29.186
make myself more palatable,
join a sorority.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.438
What's so wrong with that?

20:30.521 --> 20:31.856
[scoffs] Everything.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.482
Dear white people,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.317
you made me hate myself as a kid,

20:35.401 --> 20:38.362
so now I hate you,
and that's my secret shame.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.906
Dear white people,
if you wanted to demoralize us

20:40.990 --> 20:42.867
with your European beauty standards,

20:42.950 --> 20:44.326
mission accomplished.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.579
Ooh, ow, ooh, ow.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.957
Dear white people, you're a selfish bitch,
and I don't want to live with you anymore.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.336
[cell phone ringing]

20:54.962 --> 20:56.255
[sighs]

20:56.338 --> 20:58.716
Greetings, Big Sister Too Fabulous.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.385

Oh, well, the guys, they--

23:10.222 --> 23:11.390
they invent these secret clubs,

23:11.473 --> 23:13.642
and then they host hot girls like us
in their mansions

23:13.726 --> 23:17.521
so they can do cocaine
and make flimsy promises.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.566
