00:03.010 --> 00:08.000
# Read about the things that happen
throughout the world

00:09.020 --> 00:13.020
# But don't believe in everything
you see or hear

00:14.070 --> 00:18.000
# Read all about it

00:22.050 --> 00:25.090
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

Hello and welcome to Mock The Week.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.060
I'm Dara O Briain and
joining me this week are

00:38.060 --> 00:41.308
Rhys James, Deborah Frances-White
and Tom Allen,

00:41.310 --> 00:43.340
Milton Jones, Hugh
Dennis and Ed Byrne.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.300
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:45.302 --> 00:50.288
For subtitling services, contatct:
waqas.zahoor89@gmail.com

00:50.290 --> 00:53.320
We start with a round called If This
Is The Answer, What Is The Question?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.310
On the board are six categories.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.310
Deborah - which category
would you like?

00:57.310 --> 01:00.260
Oh, Dara, I think I'll have
politics. Excellent.

01:00.260 --> 01:03.300
Your category is Politics.
And the answer is...

01:03.300 --> 01:04.349
What is the question?

01:04.349 --> 01:09.260
Is it how many tins of Spam will be
in our weekly food rations

01:09.260 --> 01:10.300
post-Brexit?

01:12.270 --> 01:13.320
Oh, Mrs Upper Class here!

01:14.340 --> 01:17.330
Is it how many aubergine emojis
can you put in a text to your

01:17.330 --> 01:19.320
plumber before he
changes his number?

01:23.310 --> 01:27.310
Is it, what's a really bad time
to phone a cuckoo?

01:29.320 --> 01:31.300
APPLAUSE

01:35.270 --> 01:38.280
Is it how many people have eaten
in Zizzi in Salisbury this year?

01:41.260 --> 01:42.330
APPLAUSE

01:44.270 --> 01:47.330
It's how many words do
the Eskimos have for slush?

01:50.340 --> 01:53.320
Is it, if I was asked how many
people are on a football team,

01:53.320 --> 01:55.280
how many I'd hazard a guess at?

01:57.270 --> 01:58.290
Is it, how many pages

01:58.290 --> 02:01.280
of my Nuns Having Fun calendar
are stuck together?

02:05.270 --> 02:08.259
Is it how many years does a woman
have to do stand-up comedy

02:08.259 --> 02:09.350
before she's allowed
on a panel show?

02:09.350 --> 02:11.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

02:14.300 --> 02:17.310
Good point. I was doing
comedy for 10 years

02:17.310 --> 02:20.270
when I got on the show so let's
not get too carried away.

02:20.270 --> 02:24.280
Yeah, but I am 12. Oh,
yeah, true. Yeah, OK, sorry.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.280
Is it how many times a day is
Prince Philip poked with a stick by

02:28.280 --> 02:29.350
an anxious footman?

02:36.290 --> 02:39.280
Is it, if Doctor Who is eating a
pizza, on average how many

02:39.280 --> 02:42.270
times is he asked if he wants
DALEK bread with that?

02:44.310 --> 02:49.260
How old was I when my parents
stopped saying "it's a boy"
when people came to visit me?

02:50.340 --> 02:54.280
Is it, how many Jews
trust Jeremy Corbyn?

02:55.310 --> 02:57.260
APPLAUSE

03:00.350 --> 03:05.310
A question beginning with "how many
Jews" - I thought, this is going
to be an interesting moment.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.270
Yeah, I think it's how many Tory MPs
have threatened to resign

03:10.270 --> 03:11.340
if Boris Johnson becomes leader?

03:11.340 --> 03:13.320
Absolutely right.
Thank you very much, Hugh.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.290
APPLAUSE

03:16.310 --> 03:19.280
Yes, the question I was looking
for was, how many Conservative MPs

03:19.280 --> 03:22.280
are threatening to resign if
Boris Johnson became leader?

03:22.280 --> 03:24.330
The MPs issued their warning after
Johnson sparked outrage

03:24.330 --> 03:28.280
with comments in a newspaper article
about Theresa May's Brexit strategy.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.280
So what were his outrageous
comments THIS week?

03:31.280 --> 03:35.320
He used a metaphor where he
described The Constitution being

03:35.320 --> 03:38.350
wrapped in a suicide vest and the
detonator being handed to Brussels.

03:38.350 --> 03:41.290
Well, if you hand the detonator
to somebody else,

03:41.290 --> 03:44.290
it's not a suicide vest any more.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.270
APPLAUSE

03:47.320 --> 03:50.340
I realise that's not the main
point that's to be made with this.

03:50.340 --> 03:52.340
No, no, no, but I think
we need accuracy.

03:52.340 --> 03:55.320
Accuracy is very important. Accuracy
in our metaphors. Yeah, sure.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.350
People are getting very offended
by the use of, you know,

03:58.350 --> 04:00.300
figurative language lately.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.270
Just people using metaphors and
there's no need to get so angry.

04:03.270 --> 04:07.270
He also said that the UK's
battle with Europe was like

04:07.270 --> 04:10.340
a 7st weakling doing
battle with a 500lb gorilla.

04:10.340 --> 04:15.260
I wasn't offended that he used
the term 7st weakling.

04:15.260 --> 04:17.329
Dara, were you offended that he
used the term 500lb gorilla?

04:17.329 --> 04:20.320
APPLAUSE Exactly.

04:25.340 --> 04:28.340
He's really just trying to
change the subject, isn't he?

04:28.340 --> 04:30.350
I mean, it is effectively
the equivalent of going,

04:30.350 --> 04:32.260
"Oh, look, a lion!"

04:33.270 --> 04:34.320
From what, pray tell?

04:34.320 --> 04:36.300
Well, I think his
marital problems. Yeah.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.350
Because he wrapped his marriage
in a suicide vest...

04:40.290 --> 04:43.310
..and handed the detonator to the
first blonde who come up said hello.

04:43.310 --> 04:46.330
You don't really hear about
suicide SLEEVES, do you?

04:46.330 --> 04:50.280
You know, it's always vest-based.
Don't suicide bombers get cold?

04:52.260 --> 04:54.340
It's not, I imagine,
their primary concern.

04:54.340 --> 04:56.320
They've got a long way to travel.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.290
The "gil-et" is the chosen item of
choice for your average...

04:59.290 --> 05:01.260
Did you say gil-et?

05:01.260 --> 05:05.260
Do you not mean gilet? I don't
say gilet. It's a gilet, Dara.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.260
I say gil-et. Oh, my goodness.

05:07.260 --> 05:10.310
Suddenly... Suddenly, leaving
the EU sounds very appealing.

05:11.340 --> 05:15.320
There's a reason you booked a woman
and a gay and it's so we can
tell you it's gilet.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.340
Can I just say... I know, I am not
walking around saying gilet.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.280
..none of this would have
happened with suicide sleeves.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.300
You know, gilet -
the best a man can gay.

05:29.300 --> 05:32.300
I hope you're not poking fun at
us when you three are sat there

05:32.300 --> 05:35.300
like three dads outside the changing
rooms in Marks & Spencer.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.300
APPLAUSE

05:42.350 --> 05:45.340
I'll turn to the team with
the lady and the gay.

05:45.340 --> 05:50.270
Why is he so attractive? I don't
get it. Sorry... Before we proceed,

05:50.270 --> 05:53.300
this team is not known as
The Lady And The Gay.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.270
APPLAUSE

05:55.270 --> 05:58.270
It's the Lady And The Gay
And Our Adopted Son.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.270
This team is known as Diversity.

06:03.270 --> 06:06.260
We don't know, Dara, is the answer.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.320
I can't look at that man and think,

06:07.320 --> 06:10.290
"Ooh, if he were bearing down
on me, I'd change my mind."

06:11.300 --> 06:14.300
I imagine if he was bearing down
on you, you'd change your mind

06:14.300 --> 06:15.320
about a lot of things.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.280
You would completely reassess
a lot of choices you had made in

06:20.280 --> 06:24.280
life that led you to have
him bearing down on you.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.330
Listen, I haven't thought
out the plot.

06:26.330 --> 06:29.330
I've just cut to the last scene
and I don't like it.

06:29.330 --> 06:32.300
It would make a very different
series of Bodyguard,

06:32.300 --> 06:35.300
er, if he had been
the politician in question.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.280
Oh, yes, I don't think I'd like to
see him fingering himself in an

06:38.280 --> 06:40.260
adjoining hotel door.

06:40.260 --> 06:41.340
GROANS FROM AUDIENCE

06:41.340 --> 06:46.350
No, thank you. Can I say - for
many reasons - spoiler alert!

06:49.300 --> 06:52.350
You spoil my ears,
that's how bad that is.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.260
It is quite a clever trick,
though, isn't it? His hair.

06:57.260 --> 06:59.300
I mean, because it finally does
explain the hair because if

06:59.300 --> 07:01.310
you look like you've just
got out of bed,

07:01.310 --> 07:05.300
who's to know that, 90% of the time,
that is what you have just done?

07:09.340 --> 07:11.260
APPLAUSE

07:14.280 --> 07:17.280
It's amazing when you consider Boris
Johnson's impact on the world, given

07:17.280 --> 07:20.330
that he is basically a mop
that a wizard enchanted
to have an erection.

07:22.350 --> 07:25.280
It is bizarre.
There's a dossier, apparently.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.280
Number 10 created a dossier about
him, before he was to run in 2016.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.290
Created a dossier about him.

07:31.290 --> 07:34.290
A dossier. Or as you call it,
a dosser. A dosser.

07:34.290 --> 07:36.280
This is such a missed
opportunity, right.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.330
This is a document designed to get
rid of Boris that is about
his sexual history.

07:40.330 --> 07:44.260
They should have called it Get Your
Johnson Out.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.340
APPLAUSE Oh!

07:45.340 --> 07:47.320
Very good. Very good.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.280
In other news,

07:51.280 --> 07:54.320
how has Labour MP Chuka Umunna
upset some of his Party members?

07:54.320 --> 07:59.260
Is it that he said, "call off the
dogs," about some of the policies

07:59.260 --> 08:01.340
there and everybody went, "Ah, how
dare you call us dogs!"

08:01.340 --> 08:05.260
Rather than listening to what he had
to say they went, "How dare
you call us dogs!

08:05.260 --> 08:08.280
"That's outrageous, we're not dogs."
And all it made me think was,

08:08.280 --> 08:11.280
like, "Wouldn't it be wonderful
if all politicians were dogs?"

08:11.280 --> 08:14.280
Can you imagine Brexit negotiations?

08:14.280 --> 08:17.280
Like, how could Barnier say no
to an adorable Andrex puppy

08:17.280 --> 08:20.280
demanding things from the
European Union? It would be lovely.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.310
Imagine a dachshund as the
Foreign Secretary or something.

08:23.310 --> 08:26.300
It would be lovely, like, I'd really
get engaged with politics again.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.290
I love that it's your first
thought - that if we had dogs

08:29.290 --> 08:32.260
negotiating for us,
they'd be cute puppies.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.299
Not vicious Rottweilers.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.320
You've gone for the charm offensive
as opposed to the sort of...

08:37.320 --> 08:39.350
That's the thing with
heterosexual men. Yep.

08:39.350 --> 08:43.320
They always go for aggression when
actually charm can take you
an awfully long way.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.310
APPLAUSE

08:49.350 --> 08:51.280
What do we think?

08:51.280 --> 08:53.350
"Dash-hund" or "Dacks-hund"?

08:53.350 --> 08:55.290
As I said that I thought,

08:55.290 --> 08:57.330
one of those pricks is going to
pick me up on this.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.290
Some dogs do make good
politicians - look at Churchill.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.300
APPLAUSE

09:07.300 --> 09:11.260
None of this is any more ridiculous
than hearing John McDonnell

09:11.260 --> 09:12.330
treat the "call off the dogs"

09:12.330 --> 09:16.270
as being as serious as calling
Labour supporters dogs.

09:16.270 --> 09:17.340
That was possibly a low point.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.260
And it probably would be,
honestly, to the Labour Party,

09:20.260 --> 09:24.320
"Oh, my God, would you get your head
out of your collective arses? There
is a national debate going on."

09:24.320 --> 09:28.340
But this was particularly
funny to watch him go,
"Uh, you called us dogs!" No!

09:28.340 --> 09:31.340
It was a metaphor. You know!
It's a common turn of phrase.

09:31.340 --> 09:34.300
Do you think he goes to work
and literally crouches in the

09:34.300 --> 09:38.330
shadow of a filing cabinet because
he can't understand the metaphor?

09:38.330 --> 09:41.300
Do you think all the time he's
slightly out of the light?

09:41.300 --> 09:45.340
"I am The Shadow."
No, John, it's just a title.

09:45.340 --> 09:48.320
SINISTER VOICE: No!
For I am The Shadow.

09:49.330 --> 09:52.330
Especially as someone who's been
accused of institutional

09:52.330 --> 09:55.310
racism - don't call him a dark
horse, he'll lose his shit.

09:56.340 --> 09:58.350
Corbyn's been accused of
anti-Semitism

09:58.350 --> 10:01.290
but he's promised to learn
Hebrew in "Jew" course.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.310
APPLAUSE

10:06.330 --> 10:09.340
Have you had the pleasure of an
attack ever by those

10:09.340 --> 10:12.340
Corbyn supporters who are quite
attack dog about the whole thing?

10:12.340 --> 10:15.300
Have you ever had the online
joy of their company?

10:15.300 --> 10:18.300
Even as we say this - and I'm
looking straight down the lens at
you -

10:18.300 --> 10:21.330
there is somebody with a stopwatch
at the moment timing how much time

10:21.330 --> 10:25.270
we spent on Boris Johnson versus how
much time we spent
on the Labour Party.

10:25.270 --> 10:27.320
There's literally a tonne of those
people and they write in going,

10:27.320 --> 10:32.310
"Well, er, 6 minutes, 37 seconds
and then the Labour Party had
7 minutes, 14 seconds.

10:32.310 --> 10:34.260
"Oh-oh, BBC bias!"

10:38.260 --> 10:40.320
Literally, you are doing it right
now, you are doing it right now.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.350
I want you to enjoy the moment,
own the moment

10:43.350 --> 10:47.310
that I look down the lens at you
and say, "Go on, look at you, look
at the screen,

10:47.310 --> 10:49.330
"watch the seconds tick up,
watch that, right,

10:49.330 --> 10:51.280
"as I'm talking, directly to you."

10:51.280 --> 10:53.280
You big eejit. Right.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.290
I got in grief once
because we mentioned -

10:55.290 --> 10:57.320
cos we will be mentioning -
we mentioned that Corbyn and the

10:57.320 --> 11:00.320
ineffectual thing that Corbyn did
and somebody went... Someone tagged

11:00.320 --> 11:04.290
me into a Tweet going, "Well,
clearly Dara O Briain despises
the poor."

11:07.260 --> 11:10.260
To be fair, you're well known
in comedy circles for despising

11:10.260 --> 11:12.290
the poor. OK, but they
don't know that.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.350
They don't know that I do
actually despise the poor.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.310
So the Tories are in a mess,
Labour are in a mess

11:19.310 --> 11:22.340
but Vince Cable is invincible
according to spell-check.

11:25.270 --> 11:27.260
APPLAUSE

11:27.260 --> 11:31.300
OK, before we move onto the
next topic, we have to note one
small thing, by the way, which is...

11:31.300 --> 11:34.340
Actually, Deborah, this, by sheer
fluke but still a happy thing,

11:34.340 --> 11:39.300
you are our 100th guest we've ever
had on Mock The Week.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.350
APPLAUSE Oh, thank you!

11:43.260 --> 11:45.300
I'm touched, ah!

11:45.300 --> 11:48.320
And possibly the cheapest
trophy ever made.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.260
I'm the 100th guest and the fourth
woman. And I'm very thrilled.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.300
And I know that you're kind
of hurt if we, you know...

11:56.300 --> 11:59.310
All right, we got you one as well,
because you've done them all.

11:59.310 --> 12:03.300
Me? Yeah, so we got you
the Attendance Award.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.260
APPLAUSE

12:08.320 --> 12:10.310
The quality of this
metal is amazing.

12:13.340 --> 12:16.280
At the end of that round the points
go to Ed, Hugh and Milton.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.350
APPLAUSE

12:21.320 --> 12:23.280
Now we play a round called...

12:23.280 --> 12:26.320
..How Much Chock Would A Novichok
Chok If A Novichok Could Chok Chok?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.340
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

12:28.340 --> 12:32.340
This game involves Tom and Milton
so if you could make your way to
the performance area, please.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.290
This round is a stand-up challenge.

12:34.290 --> 12:36.320
I launch the Wheel of News,
and wherever it chooses to stop,

12:36.320 --> 12:39.300
one of our performers must step
forward and talk about that subject.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.290
OK, here we go,
let's spin the wheel.

12:42.330 --> 12:45.270
The first subject is - Parties.

12:46.290 --> 12:47.300
Hello.

12:48.320 --> 12:53.270
I get invited to parties, I get
invited to hen parties quite a lot.

12:53.270 --> 12:56.290
I get invited as the token gay.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.300
I know.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.330
And I never seem to get invited to
the stag parties, I don't know why.

13:01.330 --> 13:05.260
It may be people think I wouldn't
be very good at zip-wiring
through North Wales.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.270
And a little while ago I got invited
to a friend of mine's hen party -

13:13.270 --> 13:14.320
a friend of mine from school -

13:14.320 --> 13:17.290
and it was being organized by her
chief bridesmaid, Emma.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.260
And Emma is, how would
you describe her?

13:19.260 --> 13:20.280
Passive aggressive?

13:21.310 --> 13:26.300
I knew I had to go to this hen party
because suddenly I was added

13:26.300 --> 13:28.270
to a WhatsApp group!

13:28.270 --> 13:31.310
WhatsApp, WhatsApp, what's up?
Well, I'll tell you what's up.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.340
I looked at my phone.

13:32.340 --> 13:36.290
I had 324 notifications

13:36.290 --> 13:38.310
from people I did not know.

13:38.310 --> 13:41.320
I'm in this group with
the mother of the bride -
we've all got to call her "Mum".

13:41.320 --> 13:44.330
Her sister, Auntie Wendy.
And then they're all sending
selfies to each other.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.340
Except Auntie Wendy can't
send a selfie, can she?

13:46.340 --> 13:49.300
She sends a video of
her eyebrow!

13:50.330 --> 13:51.340
Twice!

13:51.340 --> 13:53.340
She's used up all my data,
all my storage has gone.

13:53.340 --> 13:56.280
Then something pink covers the lens
at the end of the video which

13:56.280 --> 13:58.330
you assume is a finger
but you don't like to ask.

13:58.330 --> 14:01.280
Then I had to go to this
hen cottage, right,

14:01.280 --> 14:04.280
this dream hen cottage which
was just outside Reading.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.330
I pulled up, I donned a penis
headdress, put a pink sash on,
got out of the car.

14:08.330 --> 14:11.340
Right, Emma was answering the door
in a steadily escalating pitch
of excitement.

14:11.340 --> 14:13.340
"Oh, my God, hi, you look
amazing, come on in."

14:13.340 --> 14:15.340
"Oh, my God, hi,
you look amazing, come on in."

14:15.340 --> 14:17.340
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING

14:17.340 --> 14:19.350
NORMAL VOICE: "Oh, hi, Tom." Rude.

14:19.350 --> 14:23.280
Then I had to go and introduce
myself to all the other hens.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.350
And if there is one thing worse
than being invited to a hen party

14:25.350 --> 14:29.340
as the token gay, it's if they've
invited another token gay.

14:31.290 --> 14:35.280
And who was it? This guy Kevin,
right, he's a dancer,
he's got a hat on.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.350
He's a better gay than me.

14:37.350 --> 14:39.320
You can't compete with that.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.340
Then we've got to go off
and do all these activities.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.280
We started the day with
a guacamole-making class.

14:44.280 --> 14:48.350
What the hell...
is a guacamole-making class?

14:48.350 --> 14:51.310
You can't chop an avocado,
it's basically just mush.

14:51.310 --> 14:53.330
Then... Then we had
to go to a Tango lesson.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.310
I can't do it,
I haven't got the hips for it.

14:55.310 --> 14:57.340
Kevin can,
he's actually VERY TALENTED.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.350
Then, right, we had
to go on a gondola ride -

15:01.350 --> 15:04.340
a gondola ride round Reading.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.320
I mean, it's hardly Venice, is it,
when you're going past a Matalan?

15:13.290 --> 15:17.280
Auntie Wendy's going, "Oh, it's just
like St Mark's Square, isn't it?
Or is that ASDA car park?"

15:18.320 --> 15:21.350
Anyway, I wish I had been on a zip
wire somewhere in Wales. Thank you.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.330
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15:28.300 --> 15:30.290
OK, that leaves us with Milton.

15:30.290 --> 15:33.290
Let's see what your topic is.
Let's spin the wheel.

15:33.290 --> 15:36.320
And the topic is Travel.
Away you go.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.290
So I'm in Brazil.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.350
And I bought some fruit off some
of the indigenous people

15:44.350 --> 15:46.310
and they turned round and said,

15:46.310 --> 15:49.330
"People who bought fruit on Amazon
also bought these sausages."

15:53.300 --> 15:55.260
APPLAUSE

15:56.340 --> 15:59.320
I don't know if you've ever fallen
asleep while eating a plate

15:59.320 --> 16:03.350
of broccoli and woken up
and thought you were in a forest.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.280
What's worse than that, though,
is falling asleep in a forest

16:09.280 --> 16:11.320
and waking up and trying
to finish the broccoli.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.330
The Paris Metro, that's the
weirdest Tesco I've been in.

16:25.320 --> 16:28.260
Easter Island,
that's a difficult place to find.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.280
Well, it's in a different
place every year.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.290
The weirdest thing
I ever saw, though...

16:35.290 --> 16:39.260
I was in Reading and I saw this
hen party.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.330
APPLAUSE

16:45.270 --> 16:47.260
Thanks, that doesn't normally work.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.300
Thank you very much, Milton
Jones! Oh, very, very good.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.270
The points there for Tom Allen at
the end. Bravo for that.

16:57.270 --> 16:58.320
APPLAUSE

17:01.320 --> 17:04.280
Our next round is called
Picture Of The Week.

17:04.280 --> 17:08.310
I show the panel a topical image
and ask them to tell me what is
happening. So, what's going on here?

17:10.329 --> 17:13.280
I think he's so sad about
getting teased about

17:13.280 --> 17:15.349
having small hands, because
he's so sensitive, he's had an

17:15.349 --> 17:19.260
operation and turned both his
little hands into one big hand.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.280
Is he saying...

17:24.280 --> 17:27.339
AMERICAN ACCENT: "No, sorry, I don't
buy remote controls at the door"?

17:27.339 --> 17:29.340
I think he's probably saying...

17:29.340 --> 17:33.290
AS TRUMP: "Sorry, this one's out
of order, I blocked it."

17:35.290 --> 17:37.260
"Of course I know how
to fly a plane,

17:37.260 --> 17:38.320
"I'm flying this plane right now."

17:40.320 --> 17:44.300
Is this Trump finding out the only
in-flight movie is Black Panther?

17:44.300 --> 17:46.320
Is he saying...

17:46.320 --> 17:49.280
AMERICAN ACCENT: "Can anyone help me
straighten my trousers?

17:49.280 --> 17:50.330
"The press is a disgrace."

17:53.290 --> 17:56.320
He just looks like he's shouting
"Ivanka, I need to be changed!"

17:59.310 --> 18:01.290
Does anyone know the
actual answer here?

18:01.290 --> 18:03.260
It does look like they've airbrushed

18:03.260 --> 18:05.260
Vladimir Putin's cock
out of that, though.

18:10.270 --> 18:13.350
The answer is, that's
Donald Trump. Yes.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.290
That is the answer.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.280
APPLAUSE

18:19.280 --> 18:23.260
Yes, this is US President Donald
Trump chatting to reporters

18:23.260 --> 18:25.280
on Air Force One recently.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.330
His presidency has been rocked
by revelations by an anonymous

18:28.330 --> 18:32.310
New York Times article and by a book
by respected Watergate journalist

18:32.310 --> 18:35.280
Bob Woodward, that portray
Trump's White House in disarray.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.300
What were the sort of
revelations, then?

18:37.300 --> 18:39.340
There weren't any
revelations whatsoever.

18:39.340 --> 18:42.340
It is exactly what we thought is
going on in The White House.

18:43.340 --> 18:47.260
It just says things like he flies
off the handle and... Yeah.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.310
..he's irrational and other
things we've,

18:49.310 --> 18:51.330
I've personally picked up
from Twitter.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.340
The book says he's... They call
him the Mayor of Crazy Town. Yes.

18:54.340 --> 18:59.260
And apparently Trump was furious
because he was like, "I'm the
PRESIDENT of Crazy Town!"

18:59.260 --> 19:02.280
Yes, he said about wanting to put
the staff under lie detectors to

19:02.280 --> 19:05.330
find who the leak is but, er,
apparently they were all broken.

19:06.350 --> 19:10.340
Taking a lie detector into that
White House is like putting
a smoke alarm in a volcano.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.290
How do lie detectors work, though?

19:14.290 --> 19:18.300
That suggests they're, like,
existing on some sort of lie rays.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.340
It's like a gaydar.

19:20.340 --> 19:24.330
Oh, it's like Grindr, it's like a
Grindr for liars. It is, yeah, yeah.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.270
Oh, OK.

19:26.270 --> 19:29.300
One of the things it tests is how
much your sphincter is retracted.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.260
The lie dictator or Grindr? Both.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.300
APPLAUSE

19:34.300 --> 19:38.280
Both. Useful to know. Yup.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.260
And now they say he's got to
just try to catch people out.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.290
Right, so he's got to just
make the one own up to writing

19:43.290 --> 19:45.330
this op-ed by just saying,
"Yeah, that op-ed was rubbish.

19:45.330 --> 19:49.260
"It was written by someone who
probably has a really small
dick and/or vagina."

19:49.260 --> 19:50.340
And then just look around
suspiciously.

19:50.340 --> 19:53.280
A small vagina isn't an insult.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.280
Yeah, but I haven't really been with
a lot of women so I don't really
know what you're talking about.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.330
That's why you're on a team
with a girl and a gay.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.320
I am learning so much.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.260
Yeah, you will.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.270
Who else has annoyed President
Trump this week? "Nik-e"?

20:10.270 --> 20:12.270
"Nik-e" have, and specifically..

20:12.270 --> 20:15.270
Isn't it "Nike", Grandad?
Oh, sweet Jesus.

20:18.350 --> 20:23.340
Yes, it is the famous footwear and
sports manufacturer, "Nik-ay".

20:26.260 --> 20:27.320
Yes, and who were they using?

20:27.320 --> 20:29.350
Whose name do you want to try and
pronounce in case I get it wrong?

20:29.350 --> 20:33.300
Colin "Kay-per-nick"?
Colin "Ka-per-nick".

20:33.300 --> 20:37.300
Colin Kaepernick has decided that
he's OK with child labour -

20:37.300 --> 20:40.300
and um... Oh, God, the poor guy.

20:40.300 --> 20:43.320
Yeah, I'm not really having a go.
I'm wearing Converse, which are
owned by Nike,

20:43.320 --> 20:46.320
so, you know, I have nothing I
can actually... Oh!

20:46.320 --> 20:49.290
Baseball shoes with a suit.
Oh, quirky dad.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.280
APPLAUSE

20:55.340 --> 20:59.300
Why was Trump furious about
Colin Kaepernick? He didn't stand.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.350
He's one of those American
footballers who didn't stand

21:01.350 --> 21:04.340
for the national anthem, which
is weird because, in Britain,

21:04.340 --> 21:07.310
going down on one knee
is the absolute mark of...

21:07.310 --> 21:10.270
You know, of...
Yes, of respect and deference.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.350
You try standing in
front of the Queen...

21:11.350 --> 21:13.320
IMITATES SLICING

21:15.270 --> 21:17.350
The point with the footballers,
though, is it is something
respectful.

21:17.350 --> 21:20.310
They're not saying, "I don't care
about the national anthem,"

21:20.310 --> 21:26.280
they're saying, out of respect
for fellow African Americans,
who are consistently being

21:26.280 --> 21:31.340
shot and killed in acts of random
police brutality, I respectfully

21:31.340 --> 21:37.350
take a knee, and it's so horrifying
that this man has now caused

21:37.350 --> 21:42.290
a furore because, you know, people
are out burning their Nike products.

21:42.290 --> 21:46.300
Yes. But sales went up by 31%
and that is because of two things.

21:46.300 --> 21:49.270
One is, all the decent, nice
Americans have gone out

21:49.270 --> 21:52.260
and bought Nike in solidarity
and all the racist ones

21:52.260 --> 21:55.280
have gone to buy extra products
in order to burn them.

21:56.340 --> 21:59.340
I wouldn't like to be
in their shoes. Phew!

21:59.340 --> 22:01.280
APPLAUSE

22:05.270 --> 22:07.320
Colin Kaepernick is so impressive -
not only because of the stuff

22:07.320 --> 22:09.320
he's done, the stand he's
taken and whatever -

22:09.320 --> 22:11.340
but also he's made people
think they're getting revenge

22:11.340 --> 22:13.350
on him by burning
their own property.

22:15.330 --> 22:19.260
Meanwhile, where has nudity been an
issue recently? The Royal Academy.

22:19.260 --> 22:22.300
The Royal Academy, yes, The Royal
Academy in London were saying it.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.260
They were looking for there to
be parity between the amount of

22:25.260 --> 22:28.260
female and male nudes on display.
It turns out, actually,

22:28.260 --> 22:31.340
ironically you're more likely to see
the penis displayed than the vagina.

22:31.340 --> 22:34.350
The nipple count is higher for
women than it is for men,
but the genital count...

22:34.350 --> 22:38.320
But overall, sort of, anecdotally,
I think we all know that in art
galleries there are many, many,

22:38.320 --> 22:42.280
many more pieces of work BY men
and many more objectified women.
Very true, that, yes.

22:42.280 --> 22:46.260
And what I was thinking is
this show is very much art. Indeed.

22:46.260 --> 22:49.350
That what we could do here is
a political act to rebalance

22:49.350 --> 22:54.290
patriarchal forces, is for me to
be the only one clothed
for the rest of the show.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.310
If you would all show your nipples,
there would be a balance.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.260
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

23:02.290 --> 23:04.290
It's what the people want.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.330
I left my... If I show my nipples,
it's not what they want.

23:06.330 --> 23:08.330
CHEERING

23:11.260 --> 23:13.260
And let me tell you this. I think...

23:13.260 --> 23:15.280
I think, people...

23:15.280 --> 23:19.260
Wow, that's one more nipple
than was available earlier today.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.310
And that is just one of them.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.310
APPLAUSE

23:23.310 --> 23:26.280
At the end of that round the points
go to Tom, Deborah and Rhys!

23:26.280 --> 23:27.350
CHEERING

23:31.320 --> 23:33.330
Now we come to
Scenes We'd Like To See.

23:33.330 --> 23:36.320
So if everyone can make
their way over to
the performance area, please.

23:36.320 --> 23:41.300
I'll read out this week's topics and
then we'll see what our panellists
can come up with.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.300
OK, here we go.

23:43.310 --> 23:48.260
The first subject is...

23:57.270 --> 23:59.280
This is Radio Novichok.

24:00.340 --> 24:02.270
Don't touch that dial.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.280
Give yourself a spray of
Lynx Africa,

24:09.280 --> 24:12.300
open up a can of Relentless, sit
back in your cargo shorts and relax.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.280
This is Virgin Radio.

24:19.320 --> 24:23.260
And with the time now at 3am
it's probably time to just

24:23.260 --> 24:25.330
stare into space and think about
where it all went wrong and...

24:25.330 --> 24:27.320
..maybe have a bit of a cry.

24:33.340 --> 24:36.340
Yes, yes, yes, coming up, we have
got some of the sickest tracks,

24:36.340 --> 24:38.320
from some of the illest
artists around.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.330
This is karaoke on hospital radio.

24:45.260 --> 24:48.260
Well, today on The Archers,
Daisy gets a bolt from the blue

24:48.260 --> 24:51.320
when she unexpectedly
wanders into an abattoir.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.350
Viking, dogger,

24:59.350 --> 25:02.280
forties, white.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.310
Oh, sorry, that's not
the shipping forecast.

25:05.310 --> 25:08.280
That's my Tinder date's bio.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.320
At number two that was
Ed Sheeran with Galway Girl.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.350
And now at number one,
for the 50th week in a row,

25:16.350 --> 25:18.300
Ed Sheeran with Galway Girl.

25:22.290 --> 25:24.280
And now the long-range forecast.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.300
It's going to be quite windy.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.290
We welcome you to Radio 3.

25:36.290 --> 25:38.330
That's right, just... Just you.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.340
And now it's time for
Thought For The Day.

25:47.260 --> 25:48.310
No, it's gone.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.300
Well, this is Gardener's Question
Time, and a big welcome

25:55.300 --> 25:59.290
especially to our younger viewers
like 92-year-old Enid from Surrey.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.350
And next on Radio 4,
it's Women's Hour.

26:05.350 --> 26:08.340
And after that, 23 men's hours.

26:13.350 --> 26:16.290
Must have coffee.

26:16.290 --> 26:18.300
That was first Thought Of The Day.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.350
On Jazz FM, it's a new
entry at number one.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.350
It's
skib-bi-di-bab-bab-bibbity-bab-beem.

26:26.350 --> 26:29.280
Sorry, I was having a stroke -
it's Ed Sheeran, Galway Girl.

26:32.330 --> 26:35.330
Boris Johnson is joining us
on the couch this morning.

26:35.330 --> 26:38.350
He's not a guest, it's just
that's where he slept last night.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.350
The shipping forecast.

26:44.350 --> 26:47.260
There will be shipping.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.260
And we interrupt this broadcast
to bring you the tragic news

26:55.260 --> 26:57.340
that Aretha Franklin
has sadly passed away.

26:57.340 --> 27:00.310
And what better way to show our
respect for Ms Franklin

27:00.310 --> 27:02.280
than with Galway Girl by Ed Sheeran?

27:03.300 --> 27:06.320
OK, the next topic is...

27:10.320 --> 27:12.310
She was bewitching.

27:12.310 --> 27:15.290
She danced as though
possessed by the elements,

27:15.290 --> 27:18.310
a creature created by the
rhythms of nature itself.

27:19.310 --> 27:21.260
More, Mrs May, more!

27:26.290 --> 27:29.350
"Toby, I'm not feeling well,"
said Amber.

27:29.350 --> 27:32.300
Embarrassed,
she turned red, then green.

27:40.270 --> 27:43.260
As he climaxed inside her, John
knew he would never be allowed

27:43.260 --> 27:45.260
to visit the
Statue of Liberty again.

27:49.340 --> 27:53.350
She looked on expectantly
as he undid his zip

27:53.350 --> 27:56.340
and slowly removed his anorak.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.340
She looked into his
deep eyes and said,

28:05.340 --> 28:09.340
"You're the most attractive
man I've ever seen.

28:09.340 --> 28:12.280
"Oh, no, wait, hold on -
I'm just ovulating."

28:15.310 --> 28:17.300
"How to Please a Lady, Chapter 1."

28:19.310 --> 28:21.330
"Wet her spoons."

28:21.330 --> 28:22.340
Ha-ha-ha.

28:22.340 --> 28:24.300
Sorry - Wetherspoons.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.350
After five unrelenting hours,

28:31.350 --> 28:35.310
James really began to regret
making his safe word "harder".

28:39.330 --> 28:41.300
She gazed around her.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.270
There were shelves
containing whips...

28:44.300 --> 28:46.290
..blindfolds...

28:46.290 --> 28:48.290
..chains, and she thought,

28:48.290 --> 28:51.300
"Lidl really do sell everything."

28:55.350 --> 28:58.350
The role play had gone wrong again.

28:58.350 --> 29:00.340
"My bad," he said,

29:00.340 --> 29:02.350
"I thought you said Mr ARSEY."

29:07.260 --> 29:10.320
As he looked at her lower back
tattoo of two little birds,

29:10.320 --> 29:12.280
one word came to mind.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.320
"Swallows."

29:18.300 --> 29:20.340
Instead of the passionate kiss
he was expecting,

29:20.340 --> 29:23.260
she just gave him a peck on
the cheek.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.350
"Ah," he thought, "this chicken is
playing hard to get."

29:30.280 --> 29:31.340
"Reader,

29:31.340 --> 29:33.300
"I SHAGGED him."

29:38.340 --> 29:41.300
His tender words still echoed
around the dappled glade as he

29:41.300 --> 29:44.260
climbed aboard and "eh-eh!"

29:47.330 --> 29:49.300
"Do you come here often?"

29:49.300 --> 29:51.340
"Yes, I come here every week
to get tested."

29:54.320 --> 29:58.270
"I know I'm supposed to get
over you," he said,
"but it's too difficult.

29:58.270 --> 30:02.310
"I'm constantly reminded of you
every time I look at the nutritional
info on a packet of food

30:02.310 --> 30:04.310
"and I see "Fat Trace"."

30:07.280 --> 30:10.280
At the end of that round the points
go to Tom, Deborah and Rhys.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.270
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:17.320 --> 30:18.350
That's the end of the show.

30:18.350 --> 30:22.330
This week's winners are Rhys James,
Deborah Frances-White and Tom Allen.

30:22.330 --> 30:25.350
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:25.350 --> 30:29.280
Commiserations to Milton Jones,
Hugh Dennis and Ed Byrne.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.310
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:31.310 --> 30:34.280
Thank you for watching.
I'm Dara O Briain. Goodnight.
