WEBVTT

00:42.459 --> 00:45.128
Thanks a lot.
Y'all have a good evening.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.333
Go, go, go!

01:33.301 --> 01:35.875
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.016
- Oh, man.
- Look, he's been shot.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.336
Oh, man.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.553
Do I have to remind you
of the nunchuck incident?

02:22.058 --> 02:25.593
If you get hurt, you're driving yourself
to the ER. All I'm saying.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.036
Freeze. Right there.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.722
- This is yours?
- Yes.

02:31.026 --> 02:34.205
It's my dragon head Kwan dao.

02:34.229 --> 02:37.251
You know, one of the
18 arms of wushu.

02:37.275 --> 02:39.631
That like those Chinese dumplings?
I love that stuff.

02:39.655 --> 02:40.917
No.

02:40.941 --> 02:46.172
Wushu is the Chinese martial art
with 18 arms or weapons.

02:46.196 --> 02:49.636
I prefer the steel whip
or the meteor hammer,

02:49.660 --> 02:52.599
but you have to stay in practise
with all of them.

02:52.623 --> 02:56.392
No doubt. I mean, you never know
when a horde of murderous Mongols

02:56.416 --> 02:58.384
are gonna come galloping
over Laurel Canyon.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.596
All hands on deck.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.577
You gave him a whistle?

03:09.601 --> 03:11.741
Oh, do I look as if I've gone daft?

03:11.765 --> 03:14.669
I'd sooner give a chainsaw
to a spider monkey.

03:14.693 --> 03:17.624
At least I took his Segway away.

03:17.648 --> 03:19.174
I'll speak to Mr. Beale.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.251
Sooner than later, okay?

03:21.275 --> 03:24.677
Because the next time he toots
that thing, he won't be using his lips.

03:24.701 --> 03:27.255
Well, maybe you can use
your wushu dragon breath.

03:27.279 --> 03:30.743
Dragon head Kwan dao!

03:37.008 --> 03:39.191
Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Wendall Dobbs.

03:39.215 --> 03:42.778
Dobbs was promoted to a job
in logistics 18 months ago,

03:42.802 --> 03:45.736
after his second tour
in Anbar Province, Iraq.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.994
That's a lot of entry wounds.
Some serious lead slinging.

03:49.018 --> 03:50.444
What were they using?

03:50.468 --> 03:52.532
AK-47 s. Multiples.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.997
The most popular gun
in every conflict around the world.

03:55.021 --> 03:56.961
Still very rare in the U.S.

03:56.985 --> 04:00.653
Eric, do we have any video footage
on the shooting?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.509
Got this from
the supermarket security camera.

04:06.533 --> 04:10.097
The plates were stolen, but I've got
Kaleidoscope looking for the vehicles.

04:10.121 --> 04:12.059
Probably stole the vehicles
for the drive-by

04:12.083 --> 04:13.852
so they could dump
and torch them after.

04:13.876 --> 04:15.955
Rewind it back to the shooting.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.987
Dropped the magazine.
Mags typically aren't expendable.

04:23.011 --> 04:25.943
- So they're either sloppy...
- Or very well-equipped.

04:25.967 --> 04:29.391
Where the hell are they getting
Kalashnikovs with extra mags?

04:30.520 --> 04:33.201
Gang violence in the military
is an ongoing problem.

04:33.225 --> 04:36.292
And SecNav is pushing hard
to route out any and all offenders.

04:36.316 --> 04:38.951
But I don't see any indications
of gang ties

04:38.975 --> 04:40.897
in Wendall Dobbs'
Service Record Book.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.091
L.A.P.D. Said there's an escalating war
between the gangs.

04:44.115 --> 04:46.003
A lot of jockeying for drug turf.

04:46.027 --> 04:48.136
Where edge in firepower
makes a big difference.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.675
Dobbs was in uniform, so it's unlikely
a case of mistaken identity.

04:51.699 --> 04:54.805
He clearly wasn't a random victim.
He was targeted.

04:54.829 --> 04:56.888
- Question is why.
- How do we wanna play it?

04:56.912 --> 04:59.935
I'll go put in a call to Dobbs' CO
and his medical officer.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.354
I'll swing by the crime scene,

05:01.378 --> 05:04.089
see if I can track down any witnesses
who are willing to talk.

05:04.512 --> 05:08.296
Well, looks like we're going to pay
our respects to the family.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.283
NCIS.

05:16.307 --> 05:17.941
May we speak with you, sir?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.775
- Come in.
- Thank you.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.298
Proudest day of my life,

05:29.322 --> 05:32.283
when Wendall graduated
from boot camp.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.891
Did your son have any enemies
you were aware of, Mr. Dobbs?

05:37.915 --> 05:40.768
Yeah, some terrorists
in Fallujah and Abu Ghraib.

05:40.792 --> 05:43.646
Any old relationships
that could've come back to haunt him?

05:43.670 --> 05:45.587
Meaning what?

05:46.262 --> 05:49.773
He was an ideal son
and an outstanding Marine.

05:49.797 --> 05:52.109
We're not trying
to disrespect your son, sir.

05:52.133 --> 05:54.528
We're just trying to find
and prosecute his killers.

05:54.552 --> 05:57.516
Then you better find them
before I do.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.859
Pardon me, gentlemen.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.737
Where Lil' Mac D?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.489
I need to talk to him.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.508
Get out before I throw you out.

06:13.532 --> 06:15.509
Hey, cool your ass, old man,
before l...

06:15.533 --> 06:17.333
Before you what?

06:18.837 --> 06:20.913
You might wanna think about
what you're doing.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.798
You best tell Lil' Mac D
we're looking for him.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.599
Let's roll.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.064
Move it. Move it.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.031
Sorry about that.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.322
Who's Lil' Mac D?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.505
I assume they mean
my younger son, James.

06:56.529 --> 06:58.511
Kids don't go by their given names
anymore.

06:58.535 --> 07:00.892
It's always Lil' this, Doggy that.

07:00.916 --> 07:03.305
Mac Daddy Love Handles.
It's ridiculous.

07:03.329 --> 07:04.645
Wendall has a brother?

07:04.669 --> 07:06.560
Yeah, James.

07:06.584 --> 07:09.132
Wendall was his rock.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.825
When he went to the war,
James got in with the wrong crowd.

07:14.849 --> 07:18.861
Wendall left a job he loved,
leading his Marines in battle,

07:18.885 --> 07:23.275
to take a non-deployable billet
back here just to help James and me.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.525
I was diagnosed with diabetes
six months ago.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.525
But I told him
I don't need a nursemaid.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.861
A man should never outlive
his children.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.536
Get down!

07:46.382 --> 07:47.758
Stay down!

07:51.096 --> 07:53.800
- You okay, sir?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.721
- You good?
- Good.

08:14.409 --> 08:17.801
Champagne-coloured
Chevy Impala low rider.

08:17.825 --> 08:19.383
Thanks, Eric.

08:19.407 --> 08:23.341
Oh, and call me if you get any IDs
on that other picture I sent you.

08:23.365 --> 08:25.726
- Thanks.
- G.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.231
Found this on the fridge.
Suntiago Equipment, Inc.

08:29.255 --> 08:31.892
Looks like a pay stub
with James' name on it.

08:31.916 --> 08:33.778
7.62-by-39.

08:33.802 --> 08:35.738
Same weapons and ammo
that killed Wendall.

08:35.761 --> 08:37.259
And they're firing cheap reloads.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.326
Maybe the Taliban's having a sale.

08:39.350 --> 08:41.096
Thanks, officer.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.874
What's Suntiago Equipment, Inc?

08:46.898 --> 08:50.293
That's where James worked.
It's a heavy equipment outfit.

08:50.317 --> 08:53.001
Backhoes, bulldozers,
that sort of thing.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.297
They're out by the airport.

08:55.321 --> 08:57.200
Why would James' gang
want Wendall dead?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.879
I don't know
what any of this is about.

08:59.903 --> 09:03.223
It may be best if you stay elsewhere
until we find somewhere safe for you.

09:03.247 --> 09:06.310
Hell, no! This is my house.
Hell, I been living here longer

09:06.334 --> 09:08.306
than most of those punks
have been alive.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.151
I'm not leaving
unless it's in a body bag.

09:11.175 --> 09:15.125
Just find my son before something bad
happens to him too.

09:15.846 --> 09:16.925
We're trying, sir.

09:21.351 --> 09:27.022
I ran Callen's covert little happy-snap
against our and L.A.P.D.'s databases.

09:27.649 --> 09:30.140
"Rashad Hollander, a.k.a. Slide.

09:32.362 --> 09:34.521
Dishonourably discharged
from the Army in 2007 for..."

09:34.865 --> 09:36.833
Let me guess. Gang activity.

09:36.857 --> 09:38.587
Bingo.

09:38.611 --> 09:42.427
Managed to compile a pretty
impressive rap sheet since then.

09:42.451 --> 09:45.386
As has Wendall's
prodigal brother, James.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.051
James seems like a petty thief,
whereas Hollander appears

09:48.075 --> 09:51.100
to be well on his way
to becoming a full-fledged sociopath.

09:51.124 --> 09:55.603
Both Rashad "Slide" Hollander
and James "Lil' Mac D" Dobbs

09:55.627 --> 09:58.340
have links
to the 82nd Street Black Posse.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.400
They've been expanding
to the territories

10:00.424 --> 10:02.532
of rival gangs
with increasing violence.

10:02.556 --> 10:05.703
So, what does this have to do with
our stellar Marine, Wendall Dobbs?

10:05.727 --> 10:07.935
That's the part
we haven't figured out yet.

10:13.028 --> 10:14.582
Check out the Humvees.

10:14.606 --> 10:16.748
Looks like they've seen some action.

10:16.772 --> 10:19.629
Something tells me
we need to play this on the down-low.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.712
Think I just became James' cousin.

10:21.736 --> 10:23.631
I'll buy that.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.514
Hey, guys,
is your supervisor around?

10:25.538 --> 10:27.332
That guy.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.057
Excuse me. How you doing?

10:34.081 --> 10:36.927
Keith Dobbs.
This is my buddy, Ernie.

10:37.552 --> 10:40.862
Ronnie Miller.
How can I help you, gentlemen?

10:40.886 --> 10:43.523
We're looking for my cousin, James.
James Dobbs.

10:43.547 --> 10:44.781
That would make two of us.

10:44.805 --> 10:46.945
Your cousin hasn't been here
since Friday.

10:46.969 --> 10:49.197
Be looking for a new job,
he doesn't check in soon.

10:49.221 --> 10:51.141
His brother was killed last night.

10:51.858 --> 10:52.890
Wendall?

10:53.944 --> 10:55.912
- You know James' brother?
- A little.

10:55.936 --> 10:58.568
I gave James the job as a favour
to Wendall. What happened?

10:59.157 --> 11:00.711
Looks like it was a drive-by shooting.

11:00.735 --> 11:03.720
But, uh, police are still looking into it.

11:03.744 --> 11:06.237
Oh, man.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.846
That's messed up. I'm so sorry.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.226
That's cool you gave him the job
as a favour.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.813
Yeah, well,
it was the least I could do.

11:15.837 --> 11:19.566
Wendall had a big part in helping me
secure my military contract.

11:19.590 --> 11:21.397
He wanted to keep the jobs
in California.

11:21.421 --> 11:23.803
I was the lowest bid in the state.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.365
You see the Humvees.

11:26.389 --> 11:27.698
I inspect and repair vehicles

11:27.722 --> 11:29.993
coming back to U.S. Bases
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

11:30.017 --> 11:32.038
Take serious abuse
in the desert over there.

11:32.062 --> 11:34.877
So we get them back in shape
for service here.

11:34.901 --> 11:37.203
It's been a real godsend
in this economy.

11:37.227 --> 11:39.278
You have any idea
where we can find James?

11:39.614 --> 11:42.046
- We're really worried about him.
- Not a clue.

11:42.070 --> 11:45.338
Any co-workers or friends,
buddies?

11:45.362 --> 11:47.885
I don't know.
He was my night watchman.

11:47.909 --> 11:50.346
So to be honest, I never saw him.

11:50.370 --> 11:52.261
Do you bring back weapons
and stuff too?

11:52.285 --> 11:53.895
No, just vehicles.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.961
Humvees mostly.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.421
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious.

11:59.676 --> 12:02.024
- Well, thanks. I appreciate it.
- Hey.

12:02.048 --> 12:03.715
- Again, my condolences.
- Thank you.

12:04.222 --> 12:05.633
- Thanks.
- Take care.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.280
Ernie?

12:09.304 --> 12:11.554
Do I look like an Ernie?

12:12.022 --> 12:14.156
So a Marine gets his brother a job
with a company

12:14.180 --> 12:16.540
that refurbishes equipment
from the war.

12:16.564 --> 12:18.335
Then that same Marine
is gunned down

12:18.359 --> 12:21.589
by gangbangers armed with AK-47 s.

12:21.613 --> 12:23.715
Seems to me these Humvees
aren't the only things

12:23.739 --> 12:25.083
being brought back from Iraq.

12:25.107 --> 12:27.052
It sounds like Wendall's
figured out a way

12:27.076 --> 12:30.637
to supply L.A. Gangs
with Kalashnikov rifles.

12:30.661 --> 12:33.595
Think we'd better have Eric
check this place out.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.870
And Ronnie Miller.

12:36.463 --> 12:38.478
We gotta get to James
before anybody else does.

12:38.502 --> 12:40.559
Well, he can't go home.

12:40.583 --> 12:41.957
Forget about the streets,

12:42.302 --> 12:44.235
especially with your own gang
after you.

12:44.259 --> 12:46.837
He's gotta be holed up somewhere.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.821
Well, his brother got him
the job here.

12:49.845 --> 12:52.283
Maybe he was always
looking out for him.

12:52.307 --> 12:55.433
No place safer
than big brother's house.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.462
TV's on.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.432
If he's hiding,
he's not gonna answer.

13:13.456 --> 13:15.914
Not even for one of
Wendall's old buddies?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.056
Wendall?

13:30.267 --> 13:32.282
It's Gordy, baby. What's up?

13:32.306 --> 13:34.245
I got your Xbox.

13:34.269 --> 13:37.557
I gotta tell you, I'm getting pretty good
at "Call of Duty."

13:40.444 --> 13:43.919
Easy, easy.
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.

13:43.943 --> 13:46.213
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Gordy. Gordon.

13:46.237 --> 13:48.542
Gordo. You're James, right?

13:48.566 --> 13:51.116
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see your brother.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.132
Yeah? Where's the Xbox then?

13:53.156 --> 13:55.241
Federal agent!

14:02.174 --> 14:03.478
Gordo?

14:03.502 --> 14:05.668
And you were complaining
about Ernie?

14:18.548 --> 14:20.184
Who killed your brother, James?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.482
You don't have to be afraid.
We're here to help.

14:22.506 --> 14:24.028
I'm not afraid of anything.

14:24.052 --> 14:25.940
So why were you hiding
at your brother's?

14:25.964 --> 14:27.526
I wasn't hiding. I was chilling.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.443
Heh, your brother's dead

14:29.467 --> 14:32.536
and your boys put about 30 rounds
in your father's house this morning

14:32.560 --> 14:34.993
with me and my partner inside.

14:35.017 --> 14:36.684
And you were just chilling?

14:37.233 --> 14:39.190
Where are Slide and the gang
getting their guns?

14:39.485 --> 14:41.121
- I don't know.
- Was your brother Wendall

14:41.145 --> 14:43.966
using Suntiago Equipment
to smuggle weapons to the gang?

14:43.990 --> 14:46.754
No way. Wendall was clean.
He was a war hero.

14:46.778 --> 14:48.719
You can't say nothing bad
about my brother.

14:48.743 --> 14:50.548
No? But you can dishonour him

14:50.572 --> 14:53.427
by acting like
some punk-ass thug, huh?

14:53.451 --> 14:56.851
What about the owner
of Suntiago Equipment, Ronnie Miller?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.645
- He bringing in the guns?
- Look, man.

14:58.669 --> 15:00.522
I don't know anything about
no guns, okay?

15:00.546 --> 15:01.854
So stop sweating me.

15:01.878 --> 15:04.481
Okay, let me ask you a question.

15:04.505 --> 15:07.215
If you're so tough,
why didn't you enlist?

15:07.805 --> 15:09.513
Your old man did. Your brother did.

15:09.807 --> 15:12.096
What were you, scared?

15:16.064 --> 15:18.768
I tried, okay? I tried.

15:23.529 --> 15:25.403
I got a heart murmur.

15:26.407 --> 15:27.878
I don't feel it.

15:27.902 --> 15:30.625
I didn't even know
that it was there. But they...

15:30.649 --> 15:32.620
Well, they wouldn't let me in
because of it.

15:36.459 --> 15:38.760
Look, James,

15:38.784 --> 15:41.369
we both know your gang buddies
killed your brother Wendall.

15:41.923 --> 15:43.251
Why?

15:43.800 --> 15:46.267
- I don't know.
- Why are you protecting them?

15:46.291 --> 15:48.983
I'm not protecting nobody
but myself.

15:49.007 --> 15:52.110
Where I come from, you're either a
gang member or you're a gang victim.

15:52.134 --> 15:55.475
And my brother, well,

15:55.770 --> 15:59.305
he couldn't be looking out for me
when he was off fighting in the war.

16:01.859 --> 16:03.662
You hungry?

16:03.686 --> 16:05.688
You like Thai food?

16:06.489 --> 16:07.900
I'm thinking Thai.

16:08.199 --> 16:09.230
Sure.

16:18.876 --> 16:20.015
Thai food?

16:20.039 --> 16:22.061
Wanna shed a little light here, Sam?

16:22.085 --> 16:25.766
- Maybe he doesn't know anything.
- Maybe. Maybe he does.

16:25.790 --> 16:28.516
He doesn't wanna talk,
but he hasn't asked for a lawyer either.

16:28.540 --> 16:30.487
He knows he's safer here
than anywhere else.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.565
Because he knows
who killed his brother.

16:32.589 --> 16:34.022
He does, Sam.

16:34.046 --> 16:36.906
But this goes way beyond murder.
We have a gunny sergeant

16:36.930 --> 16:39.652
who may be supplying
automatic weapons to L.A. Gangs.

16:39.676 --> 16:42.239
He's gonna tell us.
He just needs a little more time.

16:42.263 --> 16:43.746
Well, the more time it takes,

16:43.770 --> 16:46.754
the more likely his gang buddies are
to start using those AKs again.

16:46.778 --> 16:47.953
When that gets out...

16:47.977 --> 16:51.501
Maybe we need to be out looking
for them instead of leaning on this kid.

16:51.525 --> 16:53.361
Let him spend some time with Nate.

16:54.037 --> 16:56.171
Look, if you wanna
keep questioning him, that's cool.

16:56.195 --> 16:58.080
But I'm heading back to Ops.

17:11.012 --> 17:13.313
You know I don't like people
sneaking up on me, Hetty.

17:13.337 --> 17:15.483
I tread lightly.

17:15.507 --> 17:17.343
I don't sneak.

17:18.978 --> 17:21.825
- Are there any new developments?
- No.

17:21.848 --> 17:24.371
And what about our unfortunate
Gunny Dobbs?

17:24.395 --> 17:27.663
Still trying to convince James
to tell us about his brother's killers.

17:27.686 --> 17:29.498
And where they're getting
their guns from.

17:29.522 --> 17:33.007
Moe and Dom,
and now this young man.

17:33.031 --> 17:35.277
This one isn't hitting too close
to home, is it?

17:37.205 --> 17:39.932
The problem isn't Moe,
Dom or James.

17:39.956 --> 17:41.535
It's the other 10 million.

17:43.002 --> 17:46.751
Know what the leading cause of death
for young black men in this country is?

17:47.298 --> 17:50.003
- Homicide.
- That's right.

17:50.259 --> 17:52.524
Usually at the hands
of another young man with a gun.

17:52.548 --> 17:56.932
You can't take it upon yourself
to save all of them.

17:57.475 --> 17:58.475
No.

17:59.435 --> 18:01.309
But at least I can save this one.

18:08.611 --> 18:10.070
Sam.

18:10.446 --> 18:11.833
- In the last six months,
- Hmm.

18:11.857 --> 18:15.127
Suntiago Equipment has repaired
and refurbished hundreds of vehicles

18:15.151 --> 18:17.010
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

18:17.034 --> 18:20.595
All of which came back
via military air transport.

18:20.619 --> 18:23.471
Of course,
effectively bypassing Customs.

18:23.495 --> 18:25.138
- No Customs check?
- No.

18:25.162 --> 18:27.637
And it wouldn't be too hard
to fill those vehicles up

18:27.661 --> 18:30.769
with black-market weapons
before shipping them home.

18:30.793 --> 18:34.525
So, Gunny Dobbs helped Suntiago
Equipment get the Humvee contract,

18:34.549 --> 18:36.606
then got James a job there
as a night watchman.

18:36.630 --> 18:39.189
Eric, tell them what you found
on our friend Ronnie Miller.

18:39.213 --> 18:42.986
It's not only what I found,
but what I didn't find.

18:43.010 --> 18:46.248
Ronnie Miller used to be
Royad Markovic.

18:46.272 --> 18:49.916
Serb. Maybe changed his name
to sound more American?

18:49.940 --> 18:52.708
Royad Markovic died in '89.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.455
By the time we get a warrant
to search Suntiago Equipment

18:55.479 --> 18:58.670
and Ronnie Miller's residence,
any evidence could be long gone.

18:58.694 --> 19:02.795
- What about a FISA warrant?
- You're going to try and claim this

19:02.819 --> 19:05.217
under a Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act warrant?

19:05.241 --> 19:06.805
Well, why not?

19:06.829 --> 19:09.517
AK-47 s are a foreign weapon.

19:09.541 --> 19:12.975
They're bought on the black market.
They're smuggled into the country.

19:12.999 --> 19:17.636
Their profits are probably being used
for terrorist activities. No?

19:19.348 --> 19:21.721
Okay. I'll buy that.

19:24.145 --> 19:25.805
I thought you were staying
with James.

19:26.105 --> 19:27.872
I figured I'd let
Nate have a crack at him,

19:27.896 --> 19:32.146
so we could, uh, work
on some other angles.

19:36.073 --> 19:38.909
Checked the whole yard.
There's nothing.

19:39.285 --> 19:42.178
I told you people.
I run a legitimate operation here.

19:42.202 --> 19:43.676
I don't import weapons.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.676
If it's legitimate,
then why change your name?

19:45.700 --> 19:48.223
America's a melting pot,
I wanted to melt in.

19:48.247 --> 19:49.973
And what about the real
Royad Markovic?

19:49.997 --> 19:51.369
The one who died in Zagreb?

19:52.506 --> 19:55.152
Royad was a friend of mine.
A business partner.

19:55.176 --> 19:58.509
We had our own heavy equipment
business, but he was killed in the war.

19:59.847 --> 20:01.982
I was bankrupt.

20:02.006 --> 20:06.406
So I came here and I started over.
A new country, a new life.

20:06.430 --> 20:08.030
This isn't sounding good for you,
Ronnie.

20:11.275 --> 20:12.282
What do you got, Eric?

20:12.306 --> 20:14.003
There's been
a gang shootout downtown.

20:14.027 --> 20:16.022
They were using automatic
weapons.

20:19.659 --> 20:21.793
TV 2 is inbound to the crime scene

20:21.817 --> 20:23.346
south of downtown.

20:23.370 --> 20:25.008
TV 2. Police 3.

20:25.032 --> 20:27.340
Please, maintain 1,500 or above.

20:27.364 --> 20:29.594
Wilco on the altitude.

20:29.618 --> 20:31.264
Shop 324. Be advised.

20:31.288 --> 20:33.596
We have code 20 overhead.

20:33.620 --> 20:35.647
TV 3, perimeter is secure.

20:35.671 --> 20:37.395
County coroner's on the scene.

20:37.419 --> 20:38.838
Four-17 victims.

20:39.178 --> 20:40.945
You're good to code four.

20:40.969 --> 20:43.985
Roger that. We'll take
a last look and depart the area.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.057
Thanks for your help.

20:57.238 --> 20:59.811
AK-47 mag.

21:17.883 --> 21:19.603
Tragically a number of bystanders

21:19.627 --> 21:20.857
were caught in the crossfire.

21:20.881 --> 21:23.924
The death toll stands at four...

21:30.938 --> 21:33.868
It's one of the gangbangers
from Dobbs' house.

21:33.892 --> 21:36.308
The one that knocked on the door.

21:40.072 --> 21:42.563
Looks like our gang war's heating up.

21:55.328 --> 21:58.448
I'm guessing a couple of these guys
are friends of yours.

21:59.290 --> 22:01.757
- What happened?
- Same thing that'll happen to you.

22:01.781 --> 22:05.293
Maybe your father, if we don't
take care of this right here, right now.

22:06.339 --> 22:07.560
- How?
- By telling us

22:07.584 --> 22:10.568
where we can find who's responsible,
where they're getting weapons.

22:10.592 --> 22:12.041
I told you, I don't know.

22:12.887 --> 22:15.437
They shot your brother with AK-47 s,

22:15.461 --> 22:17.573
pumped about a pound of lead
into his body.

22:17.597 --> 22:21.053
And you don't even have the guts
to tell me who else was in that car?

22:24.774 --> 22:28.249
You wanna know who else was in car
the night my brother got killed?

22:28.273 --> 22:30.770
You really wanna know?

22:34.909 --> 22:36.154
It was me.

22:37.829 --> 22:39.288
Yeah, that's right.

22:39.497 --> 22:41.620
I was there. I saw it.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.493
I saw everything.

22:45.712 --> 22:50.290
Slide said that, uh, he wanted
to show me something.

22:50.925 --> 22:52.799
And he did.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.379
He made me watch
as they gunned Wendall down.

22:57.015 --> 22:58.425
Wendall! No!

22:59.851 --> 23:01.226
No!

23:01.644 --> 23:03.436
No! Don't!

23:11.404 --> 23:15.188
Why? Why'd they do that?

23:18.453 --> 23:23.340
Wendall wanted me out of the gang
and away from Suntiago Equipment.

23:23.364 --> 23:26.803
- Slide didn't like him interfering.
- Interfering with what?

23:26.827 --> 23:28.936
Is Miller bringing guns in
through his company?

23:28.960 --> 23:32.748
Look, I don't know, all right?
I just work the gate at night.

23:34.177 --> 23:37.546
When Slide found out,
he got real interested

23:37.972 --> 23:40.237
and he just told me
to let him in sometimes.

23:40.261 --> 23:41.868
To do what?

23:41.892 --> 23:45.226
I mean, I guess steal stuff, you know?
That's what I thought they were doing.

23:47.649 --> 23:49.368
- You don't know.
- No.

23:49.392 --> 23:51.085
I just work the gate.

23:51.109 --> 23:53.210
I don't ask questions
and they don't tell me.

23:53.234 --> 23:55.289
And your boss didn't know
what Slide was doing.

23:55.313 --> 23:57.815
No, and neither did my brother.

23:58.368 --> 24:00.693
I didn't think
it was anything big, though.

24:01.245 --> 24:03.950
I just thought
Wendall was overreacting.

24:06.501 --> 24:09.050
Now he's dead and I'm next.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.261
We'll protect you.

24:10.285 --> 24:12.871
You can't protect me any better
than my brother could.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.377
You're right.

24:20.014 --> 24:23.430
Because sooner or later, we all end up
on our own, with no one at our back.

24:23.893 --> 24:26.325
At that point, you have to decide
which side you're on.

24:26.349 --> 24:28.098
And whether you're gonna run
or fight.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.949
Now, you choose to stick
with Slide and his gang,

24:30.973 --> 24:32.728
you'll wind up dead just like JJ.

24:33.695 --> 24:37.040
Try running from Slide and his crew,
and you'll probably wind up dead too.

24:37.064 --> 24:40.110
Because they're gonna hunt you down
like a dog.

24:41.744 --> 24:44.805
But if you stand and fight with us,

24:44.829 --> 24:49.018
I promise you
we will take these guys down

24:49.042 --> 24:52.602
and you won't have to run
or hide again.

24:52.626 --> 24:55.632
What makes you think you can take
Slide's gang down when cops can't?

25:00.888 --> 25:03.177
We're not cops.

25:11.941 --> 25:13.032
Straight day in Los Angeles,

25:13.056 --> 25:14.870
with a shootout earlier this morning

25:14.894 --> 25:16.694
outside an illegal Hollywood
after-hours club.

25:18.156 --> 25:20.836
Two men believed to be members
of a Colombian drug cartel

25:20.860 --> 25:24.295
were riddled with automatic gunfire
while sitting in their car.

25:24.319 --> 25:27.223
James is the only way to get
to the gang that killed his brother.

25:27.247 --> 25:30.807
Look, Slide, Rashad Hollander,
is extremely dangerous.

25:30.831 --> 25:32.389
And after this morning's shootout,

25:32.413 --> 25:34.306
he's gonna be even more
paranoid and jumpy,

25:34.330 --> 25:36.557
which is gonna make him
more prone to violence.

25:36.581 --> 25:38.311
Which is why we have to act now.

25:38.335 --> 25:41.688
Get those killers and their automatic
weapons off the street.

25:41.712 --> 25:44.402
What's to say Slide doesn't kill James
the moment he sees him?

25:44.426 --> 25:46.366
He's your only witness in any of this.

25:46.390 --> 25:49.785
Slide's already lost three guys,
including JJ, his right-hand man.

25:49.809 --> 25:52.707
He's in a turf war with the Mexicans
and the Colombians.

25:52.731 --> 25:54.333
He'll take all the help he can get.

25:54.357 --> 25:58.084
Look, I know you guys are gonna do it
anyway, but I just want it on the record

25:58.108 --> 26:01.173
that I think this op
has an unacceptable risk level.

26:01.197 --> 26:02.919
There are too many dangerous
variables,

26:02.943 --> 26:05.169
especially with this short of a setup.

26:05.193 --> 26:08.370
That said, I hope you kick some ass.

26:08.873 --> 26:09.964
I'll prep James.

26:09.988 --> 26:11.850
I'll get Eric
working on the tech spread.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.391
I'll download some more
profiles on Slide.

26:14.415 --> 26:17.458
- May be something there you can use.
- Thanks, Nate.

26:18.966 --> 26:20.650
You wanna be briefed on this?

26:20.674 --> 26:23.168
I don't know, do I?

26:23.513 --> 26:25.113
I could run it by Vance, if you prefer.

26:25.137 --> 26:27.156
Oh, Lord, no.

26:27.180 --> 26:30.077
One of the reasons I'm here
is to protect him

26:30.101 --> 26:32.119
as a designated fall guy.

26:32.143 --> 26:36.334
"I had no previous knowledge
of the operation, Mr. Secretary.

26:36.358 --> 26:40.358
That mad woman went off her rocker
and acted autonomously."

26:40.947 --> 26:42.666
You're the first line of defence?

26:42.690 --> 26:44.988
Yeah, you gotta get by me first.

26:46.410 --> 26:48.426
- And Mr. Hanna?
- Will be as safe as we can manage,

26:48.450 --> 26:49.652
as will James.

26:50.039 --> 26:51.581
Bring them both back, hmm?

26:52.458 --> 26:57.001
Go with God, Mr. Callen,
or whoever it is who watches over you.

26:58.339 --> 26:59.833
I have a guardian angel.

27:01.551 --> 27:04.801
She's tiny, but very tough.

28:01.652 --> 28:04.962
All right, Sam's button cam is up.

28:04.986 --> 28:07.171
Where are we
with the schematics on this building?

28:07.195 --> 28:10.616
Building is old. I'm not sure
they're even available, but I'm trying.

28:30.514 --> 28:33.005
Long time no see, Lil' Mac D.

28:33.517 --> 28:36.281
Well, lookie here,
Mr. Night Watchman.

28:36.305 --> 28:38.637
We all been wondering where
Lil' Mac D been hiding.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.189
Turns out the little bitch was
on his honeymoon.

28:44.271 --> 28:47.280
Yo, this is my cousin, Sam.
He just got out here from New York.

28:49.575 --> 28:51.343
I don't care
if he's your imaginary friend.

28:51.367 --> 28:53.777
You shouldn't
have brought him here.

28:55.039 --> 28:57.078
Your cousin, huh?

28:59.585 --> 29:02.372
Where's your little white girlfriend at,
coz?

29:03.172 --> 29:05.248
He's my parole officer.

29:06.717 --> 29:08.401
Parole officer.

29:08.425 --> 29:10.338
We got us a genuine bad ass here.

29:10.638 --> 29:13.449
Sam did four years up in New York.
Sing Sing.

29:13.473 --> 29:15.444
- Supposed to impress me?
- Looking for work.

29:15.468 --> 29:17.658
- Try Burger King.
- James said you was look...

29:17.682 --> 29:19.929
Just shut the hell up.
I ain't talking to you.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.681
I been calling you, Lil' Mac D.

29:24.068 --> 29:25.396
Yeah, you know, I've been, uh...

29:26.362 --> 29:30.288
I've just been dealing with
my brother's funeral and, uh, stuff.

29:30.312 --> 29:31.747
I heard about JJ.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.928
Yeah. You heard how many Mexicans
we smoked?

29:34.952 --> 29:37.552
- Yeah. Ha, ha.
- And the Colombians.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.124
Tore them up. They was all like:

29:51.429 --> 29:53.302
Think you can run
with the big dogs, coz?

29:53.806 --> 29:54.861
What you think, Tiny?

29:54.885 --> 29:57.631
- He don't want nothing.
- Yeah.

29:58.352 --> 29:59.550
Let's see what you got.

30:07.653 --> 30:09.646
It's okay.
They're just jumping him in.

30:16.787 --> 30:18.423
- Eric, we lost our feed.
- Yeah.

30:18.447 --> 30:20.556
I'm working on it.
These aren't indestructible.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.292
Neither is Sam.

30:27.214 --> 30:29.290
Did I tell you to do that?

30:35.639 --> 30:36.920
Yo, fuck you, man. Fight!

30:39.894 --> 30:41.886
What's up, big man?
What's up? What's up?

30:52.782 --> 30:54.442
That's enough!

30:54.992 --> 30:56.237
I said that's enough!

31:03.959 --> 31:06.629
You just got owned, fat boy.

31:13.052 --> 31:14.380
Welcome to the clique.

31:30.419 --> 31:31.474
Eric, talk to me.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.677
Camera has been damaged.

31:32.701 --> 31:34.136
I'm trying to get the picture back.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.557
I need to know what's happening.
At least get me audio.

31:36.581 --> 31:38.252
I'm trying.

31:38.844 --> 31:40.006
Man.

31:40.262 --> 31:42.314
Yo, you need to go to work, man.

31:42.338 --> 31:44.174
What about my cousin?

31:44.766 --> 31:46.142
Got a job for him too.

31:48.186 --> 31:49.811
Let's go, man.
Get the hell out of here.

31:51.523 --> 31:52.982
Let's go. Let's go.

31:53.734 --> 31:55.014
Callen.

31:57.904 --> 31:59.564
James is leaving.

32:01.199 --> 32:02.362
James is on the move, Eric.

32:07.372 --> 32:10.515
- Where are they taking him?
- It's okay.

32:10.539 --> 32:12.666
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd already be dead.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.036
Look at that.

32:30.060 --> 32:32.102
Yeah.

32:34.107 --> 32:35.649
Puppet.

32:38.028 --> 32:41.420
- Tiny.
- Some serious firepower.

32:41.444 --> 32:44.841
- You got some more?
- You know how hard it is to get these?

32:44.865 --> 32:46.968
I thought maybe you guys
were selling them.

32:46.992 --> 32:49.296
- You thought wrong.
- Where you get these?

32:49.320 --> 32:51.300
- Craigslist.
- Hope you got a good price.

32:51.324 --> 32:53.100
- Nice and cheap.
- And why is that?

32:53.124 --> 32:55.594
They look like the real deal,
but they're knockoffs.

32:55.618 --> 32:58.476
That's why Butterfingers
is having a problem locking in his clip.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.223
- What makes you such an expert?
- I used to move guns.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.359
- Yeah?
- What you think I was in jail for?

33:03.383 --> 33:06.223
And I bet that ammo you're using
is crapping reloads too.

33:08.225 --> 33:11.570
Seriously, I think you got ripped off.
I wouldn't fire one of those.

33:11.594 --> 33:13.430
It's more likely to blow up
and kill you.

33:15.273 --> 33:18.167
Fool, we've been busting these
like freaking Rambo.

33:18.191 --> 33:19.913
It ain't no problem.

33:19.937 --> 33:21.879
Not yet.
How many rounds went through there?

33:21.903 --> 33:25.214
I bet it's less than three clips.
Just wait.

33:25.238 --> 33:29.453
You don't have to worry about that,
because you ain't getting one.

33:31.122 --> 33:33.672
I swear to God, Tiny,
if your uncle jacked us on these,

33:33.696 --> 33:36.473
I'm driving to Miami myself
to kill him.

33:36.497 --> 33:38.685
- You got these from Miami?
- That's right.

33:38.709 --> 33:41.394
My Uncle Boney got six of them
from South America.

33:41.418 --> 33:43.880
Will you shut up, Tiny?

33:54.229 --> 33:55.688
You can drive.

33:57.566 --> 33:59.143
Let's go.

34:15.792 --> 34:19.219
If these guys mount a.50 cal
on that thing, I'm gonna retire.

34:19.243 --> 34:21.804
- Eric, in a Humvee.
- I'll stay on them with traffic cams.

34:21.828 --> 34:23.891
Alert L.A.P.D. And Highway Patrol.

34:23.916 --> 34:26.132
I don't want anyone pulling
that Humvee over.

34:38.106 --> 34:41.190
Yo, Lil' Mac D. Open the gate.

35:01.338 --> 35:03.959
Eric, we're at Suntiago Equipment.

35:17.938 --> 35:20.938
Look over there.
Check out those Humvees.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.135
You see anything?

35:32.159 --> 35:34.379
No, lost them behind the Humvee.

35:34.403 --> 35:36.263
Eric, Kensi and I are going in.

35:36.287 --> 35:38.259
We need additional backups
at Suntiago.

35:38.283 --> 35:40.747
- Nobody leaves this lot.
- I got it.

35:48.927 --> 35:51.216
Hey, yo, I got something.

35:53.848 --> 35:55.011
That's just bloodstains.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.141
Keep looking.

36:03.775 --> 36:05.768
There's some right here, 622.

36:22.377 --> 36:25.473
- Come on, man, hurry up.
- I think it's dead.

36:25.497 --> 36:28.079
You're gonna flood it, man.
Look out, man.

36:36.057 --> 36:37.220
Come on, man.

36:39.185 --> 36:40.572
You know anything
about Humvees?

36:40.596 --> 36:43.261
- Enough to steal them.
- Think you can get this started?

36:43.815 --> 36:46.163
- Why don't we try another one?
- Because I want this one.

36:46.187 --> 36:48.707
Why? What's so special
about this one? What's it got?

36:48.731 --> 36:51.655
- Satellite radio or something?
- Can you get it started or not?

36:52.032 --> 36:53.692
Probably be easier to call AAA.

36:55.535 --> 36:57.907
Probably be easier if
I just shot you in your head.

37:02.125 --> 37:03.785
I doubt that would get this started.

37:14.721 --> 37:17.947
- It's the battery.
- Open the hood.

37:17.971 --> 37:20.822
- It's under the passenger seat.
- How you know that?

37:20.846 --> 37:22.240
You an expert on Humvees too?

37:22.264 --> 37:24.986
Like I said,
I know enough to steal them.

37:25.010 --> 37:28.451
I spent 20 minutes one night trying
to find the battery on one of these.

37:28.475 --> 37:30.667
Now you want me
to get this started or not?

37:30.691 --> 37:32.356
I need some heavy-duty
jumper cables.

37:33.364 --> 37:37.576
Well, go find some cables, man.
You two, both of you, go! Now, man!

37:41.164 --> 37:44.176
Eric, did our backups just drive
right by us?

37:44.200 --> 37:46.913
- Impossible. They're nowhere near yet.
- Then we got company.

37:52.967 --> 37:53.999
What the hell is this?

37:54.427 --> 37:56.669
How am I supposed to know?
It's your party.

37:57.597 --> 38:01.677
You! Get out of the car, now!
Tiny, check him for jumper cables.

38:03.269 --> 38:05.155
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

38:05.179 --> 38:07.762
- Shut up and get on the ground!
- You're on my property!

38:10.235 --> 38:12.026
- I got jumper cables.
- Hook him up.

38:17.158 --> 38:18.818
Take it.

38:20.620 --> 38:22.743
Now's your chance
to get some street cred.

38:25.375 --> 38:26.869
Kill him.

38:29.212 --> 38:31.679
We start shooting out here,
the cops will be all over us.

38:31.703 --> 38:33.020
We'll never get out of here.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.209
What make you think
you getting out of here?

38:36.386 --> 38:39.221
Puppet, swap out the Humvees.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.306
Time to man up, boy.

38:52.735 --> 38:53.980
You killed my brother.

38:54.446 --> 38:57.281
Don't do it, James.
Put the gun down.

38:58.450 --> 38:59.481
Do it.

39:02.537 --> 39:05.075
Do it. Pull the trigger.

39:11.546 --> 39:14.037
That's what I thought.
You can't do it.

39:18.845 --> 39:21.276
Yo, Puppet. Come here
and smoke this sorry piece of...

39:21.300 --> 39:24.118
- Drop the guns!
- Federal agents. Drop your weapons.

39:24.142 --> 39:25.767
Get down!

39:50.752 --> 39:51.950
Go! Go!

40:23.243 --> 40:25.069
- You good?
- Right as rain.

40:30.541 --> 40:32.084
Hey.

40:32.794 --> 40:33.968
Good job.

40:33.992 --> 40:36.933
You showed the same courage
your father and brother did as Marines.

40:36.957 --> 40:39.587
- They would both be proud of you.
- Thanks, man.

40:46.391 --> 40:48.716
Not much more of this Humvee
we can pull apart.

40:57.694 --> 40:59.651
Bingo.

41:02.865 --> 41:04.525
Looks like heroin.

41:08.079 --> 41:10.036
- It's about a kilo.
- May I?

41:10.498 --> 41:11.577
Sure.

41:14.294 --> 41:16.891
Fresh from the poppy fields.

41:16.915 --> 41:20.065
We thought Slide was using overseas
connections to smuggle in guns.

41:20.089 --> 41:21.479
Turns out it was drugs.

41:21.503 --> 41:25.317
Packed away nicely in the Humvees
coming back from Afghanistan.

41:25.341 --> 41:26.817
James let them into the compound.

41:26.841 --> 41:29.506
They'd swap the Humvee
with the drugs for one of their own.

41:29.851 --> 41:31.950
Foolproof plan
Gunny Dobbs stumbled upon.

41:31.974 --> 41:35.395
We send our young men
to slay the terrorist dragon,

41:36.065 --> 41:40.359
and what do we get back
but the dragon we were sent to slay.

41:40.862 --> 41:42.142
It's hard to believe,

41:42.488 --> 41:45.299
but it was a beautiful country
once upon a time.

41:45.323 --> 41:46.630
You've been to Afghanistan?

41:46.654 --> 41:49.803
I spent a wonderful Christmas there
in Bamiyan Valley

41:49.827 --> 41:52.344
with a local Pashtun family.

41:52.368 --> 41:54.283
When was that?

41:54.584 --> 41:59.412
Well, it must have been, uh, 1979.

42:00.548 --> 42:04.249
Didn't the Russians invade
Afghanistan, Christmas 1979?

42:08.014 --> 42:13.353
So they did, Mr. Callen. My mistake.

42:14.562 --> 42:17.492
I meant 1978.

42:17.516 --> 42:19.599
Of course you did.

42:21.527 --> 42:23.816
How silly of me.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.117
Oh, dear.
