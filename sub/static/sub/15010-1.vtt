00:08.300 --> 00:11.370
Today, new dangers face mankind.

00:12.074 --> 00:16.212
Dangers which challenges life,
threaten it's very existence.

00:16.912 --> 00:21.575
Sound frequencies have been found
that can penetrate the human brain
and destroy life.

00:22.555 --> 00:25.560
Deadly isotopes of unknown elements
have been discovered.

00:25.661 --> 00:28.201
That can burn and sear the flesh.

00:28.763 --> 00:34.227
Pilotless aircraft crashing the sonic barrier
can gain complete mastery over the skies.

00:35.140 --> 00:37.872
To meet this challenge to our existence

00:38.011 --> 00:42.280
a new agency has been formed.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.911
O.S.I:
The Office of Scientific investigation.

00:47.158 --> 00:50.651
The operatives of O.S.I
are called A-Men.

00:51.230 --> 00:54.998
A-Men, sounds like the final
word of a prayer.

00:55.202 --> 00:56.966
It is not.

00:57.272 --> 01:01.301
"A" stands for Atom
and "Atom" stands for power.

01:01.577 --> 01:05.277
Power man has unleashed
but has not yet learned to control.

01:05.819 --> 01:10.258
Whirling in space, each atom is a
solar system unto itself.

01:10.826 --> 01:13.562
When studies separately,
it's gamma rays yield

01:13.563 --> 01:18.593
information useful in the
experiments carried on by
the technicians at O.S.I

01:19.205 --> 01:21.810
Our equipment covers the
range of instruments

01:21.811 --> 01:26.772
From the simple test tube to the
complex 50,000 Volt Electron Microscope.

01:27.150 --> 01:30.518
A-Men are detectives
with degrees in science.

01:30.688 --> 01:34.395
The criminals we seek are sometimes
invisible to the human eye

01:34.396 --> 01:39.891
Like radiation from outer space,
or particles held prisoner deep
in the heart of the atom.

01:40.203 --> 01:41.938
Infinitesimal,

01:41.939 --> 01:46.245
yet within this tiny molecule there's
a tremendous force that once unlocked

01:46.246 --> 01:49.049
can create or destroy planets.

01:49.149 --> 01:52.652
Our Earth, is a planet.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.624
July 18,

01:54.625 --> 01:58.595
The morning, calm, quiet, peaceful.

01:58.596 --> 02:02.056
I reported for work as usual at
8:55am.

02:02.469 --> 02:05.073
My name is Stewart,
Jeff Stewart.

02:05.074 --> 02:07.772
Class of 39, M.I.T, Boston, Mass.

02:08.949 --> 02:11.490
I'm in charge of research at O.S.I.

02:11.491 --> 02:13.730
The world seemed safe and good.

02:13.931 --> 02:17.256
Bye, honey.
I'll pick you up at six.

02:17.257 --> 02:19.161
Eh, what is this, a brush off?

02:19.162 --> 02:22.495
Didn't I buy you dinner and flowers
and breakfast?

02:25.769 --> 02:28.307
Jeff, you're late,
and I'm a married woman.

02:28.308 --> 02:30.936
Are you?
You don't act that way at all.

02:33.147 --> 02:36.832
There's lipstick on your nose.
Very undignified for a man of science.

02:36.867 --> 02:40.627
Call me as soon as you've seen the
doctor, will you?
It's nothing honey, just a routine check up.

02:40.659 --> 02:43.942
I want to know why you're so skinny.
Other girls are fat in their 4th month.

02:43.977 --> 02:47.226
- They aren't.
- And don't do any housework.

02:47.302 --> 02:50.602
Heavens, no! The upstairs maid
and the butler will do it all.

02:50.673 --> 02:53.234
- I mean it! See you at six.
- Bye.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074

03:12.706 --> 03:16.769
RESEARCH

03:19.182 --> 03:22.711
Yes General, Doctor Allard's in.
I'm connecting you.

03:24.422 --> 03:26.482
- Good morning Dr. Stewart.
- Morning Nelly.

03:26.559 --> 03:30.199
Dr. Forbes is waiting for you he'd like you to
come in to the lab, he says it's urgent. -Ok.

03:32.802 --> 03:34.669
- Hey Nelly...
- Yes Dr Stewart.

03:34.704 --> 03:37.231
- You've got children, haven't you?
- A boy and a girl.

03:37.942 --> 03:40.639
Were you skinny in your 4th month?

03:40.813 --> 03:42.941
I was never skinny.

03:45.687 --> 03:47.713
Office of Scientific investigation...

03:48.692 --> 03:50.888
- Morning Dan.
- Hi.

03:52.063 --> 03:55.330
Jeff, when was the last atomic test
at Las Vegas?

03:55.502 --> 03:57.596
Couple of months ago, why?

03:57.772 --> 04:00.503
Would you mind checking these
here samples for me please?

04:00.742 --> 04:01.971
Sure.

04:04.315 --> 04:06.784
- What's the trouble?
- I'll show you.

04:23.644 --> 04:26.910
2280 disintegrations per minute.

04:27.349 --> 04:29.649
Much higher than yesterday's
concentration.

04:30.887 --> 04:33.648
- Could there be something wrong with the counter?
- No, I checked it.

04:34.592 --> 04:36.653
Let's have another sample.

04:56.125 --> 04:59.118
2360 disintegrations per minute.

05:12.681 --> 05:15.014
Traces of radioactive dust.

05:18.391 --> 05:20.450
Hand me that pad, will you.

05:24.933 --> 05:29.304
Average disintegrations
per minute 2300.

05:30.074 --> 05:33.170
- What time is it?
- Exactly 9 O'clock.

05:44.329 --> 05:46.560
- Good morning Mr. Simon.
- Morning.

05:53.476 --> 05:54.943
Albert!

05:56.547 --> 05:59.244
- Yes Mr. Simon?
- Look, the clocks.

05:59.518 --> 06:03.236
I am an orderly man,
I'm running an orderly store.

06:03.271 --> 06:06.954
It's 9 O'clock now and our clocks
say it's 12 minutes past 12.

06:09.032 --> 06:10.591
I don't get it.

06:10.702 --> 06:13.900
You don't get a lot of things,
like a raise for instance.

06:13.973 --> 06:17.171
It's my duty to pay your wages,
and it's your duty to wind the clocks.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.704
But I wound them!

06:18.913 --> 06:22.977
- Customers don't buy clocks that
show the wrong time.

06:23.053 --> 06:25.773
I wound all the clocks last night!
The electric clock has Mr Simon...

06:26.124 --> 06:29.529
12 minutes past 12.

06:29.564 --> 06:31.804
- There must have been a power failure.
- Try the lights.

06:33.801 --> 06:37.204
- Well the lights are working.
- Well then the clocks ought to work too.

06:37.473 --> 06:39.534
- Yes but they don't.
- Mr. Simon!

06:39.843 --> 06:40.869
Mr. Simon!

06:42.281 --> 06:43.840
- Mr. Simon!
- What's this?

06:43.917 --> 06:47.410
- It's stuck!
- It's not stuck, it's magnetised.

06:48.758 --> 06:50.792
Mr Simon, there are magnetised too!

06:50.827 --> 06:53.820
- But I can't understand it.
- My wristwatch has stopped.

06:54.532 --> 06:58.198
- Mine too!
- Mine still shows 9, that's the
time entered the store.

06:59.306 --> 07:00.798
Look!

07:11.223 --> 07:14.125
Someone is wrecking my store
with magnetic power.

07:14.194 --> 07:17.188
- Magnetic power?
- We must call the police!

07:20.805 --> 07:25.073
Hello operator?
Give me the Department of Power and Light.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.683
Immediately! This is an emergency,
do you understand, an emergency!

07:30.886 --> 07:32.250
Engineer Watson speaking.

07:32.723 --> 07:35.090
Yes, I'm the chief Engineer.

07:36.027 --> 07:38.691
Simon's Hardware store,
918 Lincoln?

07:40.033 --> 07:41.933
Yes, I know where that is.

07:42.938 --> 07:44.165
What's that?

07:44.640 --> 07:48.669
Well you must have a powerful
magnet in your store. You haven't?

07:49.546 --> 07:52.919
I can't have appliances sailing
around my store.

07:52.954 --> 07:55.752
Listen Mr Simon, I have no time
for practical jokes.

07:55.922 --> 07:58.893
But I am a taxpayer,
do you understand? I insist!

07:59.028 --> 08:01.862
Alright, alright Mr Simon, I'll
have somebody over there right away.

08:02.633 --> 08:04.464
918 Lincoln.

08:11.379 --> 08:13.507
Office of Scientific investigation?

08:13.649 --> 08:15.584
Connect me with Dr Allard please.

08:17.020 --> 08:19.820
This is the office of power and light.
Watson speaking.

08:20.827 --> 08:24.285
Say Doctor, directive 149, says that
if anything unusual happens

08:24.364 --> 08:26.560
to contact your office immediately.

08:26.868 --> 08:30.773
I think you'd better send a couple
of your A-Men over to Simon Hardware...

09:02.721 --> 09:06.124
Well I'm glad you got here, my name
is Simon I am the proprietor.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.754
I'm Dr. Stewart.
This is Dr. Forbes, my assistant.

09:08.963 --> 09:10.694
What seems to be the trouble?

09:19.212 --> 09:20.680
This.

09:27.057 --> 09:29.892
When did you first notice these
magnetic effects?

09:29.962 --> 09:31.361
When I first entered the store.

09:31.531 --> 09:34.023
All of the clocks stopped last
night at 12 past 12.

09:34.201 --> 09:36.067
I am answering the questions..

09:36.604 --> 09:38.596
Could I have a piece of stiff paper please.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.748
- Er thank you, and some small tacks.
- Er, Joy?

09:50.292 --> 09:51.657
Thank you..

10:02.543 --> 10:05.446
- This proves our point Mr Simon.
- What point?

10:05.582 --> 10:08.222
See if we can find out where it
comes from. Yeh, that's a good one.

10:13.291 --> 10:14.658
That'll do it.

10:20.836 --> 10:23.671
- The epicentre is up there.
- Epicentre?

10:24.909 --> 10:26.606
What do you keep up there Mr Simon?

10:26.880 --> 10:29.577
There's nothing to do with the store,
they're offices.

10:34.290 --> 10:36.987
What would you say Dan?
Paramagnetic forces, no doubt about it.

10:37.394 --> 10:41.797
Get the prober for me, will you?
Could I use one of those fish poles?

10:42.399 --> 10:43.892
- Albert.
- Yes sir.

10:45.005 --> 10:47.174
No no, not a metal one, the bamboo.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.110
Thank you.

10:55.487 --> 10:57.207
There's a bomb in there,
I can hear it tick!

10:57.957 --> 10:59.692
- This isn't a bomb, it's a Gieger Counter.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.197
-Why does it tick?
The clicking noise shows the presence
of radiation.

11:06.702 --> 11:07.702
Radiation?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.413
Small frequency indicates it's
not dangerous, yet.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.306
- We'd better put the badges on though.
- Alright.

11:23.330 --> 11:26.697
What's this all about, where does
the magnetism come from?

11:27.200 --> 11:30.759
Radiation definitely emanating from the
2nd floor, wouldn't you say Dan?

11:32.073 --> 11:33.233
Yes, I imagine just overhead.

11:34.376 --> 11:36.576
- What are those things for?
- Photographic plates.

11:38.016 --> 11:41.751
Any radiation will expose them.. We want
to know how much radiation we absorb.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.291
This store was founded in 1905,

11:45.395 --> 11:47.589
Now we handle the most modern equipment.

11:48.164 --> 11:50.204
But nothing like this has ever
happened here before.

11:50.268 --> 11:52.333
Nelly, connect me with Dr. Allard please.

11:55.442 --> 11:57.207
- Yes?
- Dr. Stewart on 4.

12:00.382 --> 12:01.382
Yes Jeff?

12:03.353 --> 12:04.833
Well I don't see how that's possible?

12:06.124 --> 12:07.784
Must be Para-Magnetism.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.758
Have you found the source?

12:10.759 --> 12:12.928
No sir, not yet, not definitely.

12:13.969 --> 12:15.697
Well get into your protective
clothing at once.

12:15.698 --> 12:18.391
Yes sir, we have protective
clothing in the car.

12:18.392 --> 12:21.073
I'll get police help to you
as soon as I can.

12:21.609 --> 12:23.106
Now here's what I want you to do...

12:24.083 --> 12:26.517
Yes, yes sir I understand.

12:27.256 --> 12:28.383
Right chief.

12:28.959 --> 12:32.327
- What did he say?
- To wait for the police to surround the block.

12:32.328 --> 12:33.455
The Police?

12:34.098 --> 12:37.264
We'll use every means at our disposal
to recover the radioactive matter.

12:37.438 --> 12:39.463
Police will be instructed
to shoot to kill.

12:41.008 --> 12:42.376
Come on, let's go.

13:05.145 --> 13:09.382
- 320 milliroentgens.
- We're getting hot alright.

13:10.286 --> 13:11.351
Beta rays increasing.

13:21.267 --> 13:25.603
Jeff. You remember Newbold's
theory of unipole magnetism?

13:26.108 --> 13:28.504
Sure, heavy element out of equilibrium.

13:29.314 --> 13:31.946
Only one pole, North or South.

13:33.051 --> 13:35.545
Defies gravitation. Why?

13:36.325 --> 13:38.488
You suppose that this could be it?

13:41.198 --> 13:42.332
Stick close to me.

13:46.206 --> 13:47.606
Sounds like a machine gun.

14:00.460 --> 14:01.956
This place is really loaded.

14:02.262 --> 14:04.323
Must be right here.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.465
Come here.

14:48.129 --> 14:49.159
Overdose of radiation.

14:49.399 --> 14:53.064
Must have been dead for hours.
Wonder who he is?

14:54.405 --> 14:55.405
Find out that out later.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.344
Jeff the impulses don't
seem to be dying down..

14:59.313 --> 15:02.341
Emanations constant.
420 'MR'.

15:03.618 --> 15:07.522
There must be another strong source
of radioativity around here somewheres..

15:25.118 --> 15:26.148
Here it is!

15:36.935 --> 15:39.263
Empty. It isn't there any more.

15:45.747 --> 15:49.047
It must have contained a very
heavy element. Heavier than Uranium.

15:50.153 --> 15:52.921
It must have been pretty close
to an explosive stage too.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.387
Strong enough to kill.

15:57.198 --> 15:58.864
Or wipe out a few city blocks.

15:59.135 --> 16:01.536
Jeff, being magnetic..

16:02.005 --> 16:05.904
It must be showing up on TV screens,
interfering with radar.

16:06.144 --> 16:07.144
Right.

16:08.114 --> 16:10.752
Whatever it is, it can't hide from us.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.520
- Come on, let's get going.
- Right.

16:17.429 --> 16:19.227
10:40 am.

16:20.199 --> 16:23.171
Forbes and I went back, checked the
hardware store with special equipment.

16:23.706 --> 16:25.135
Then returned to O.S.I.

16:25.540 --> 16:29.676
We didn't know where the element was,
but we knew it would strike again.

16:29.677 --> 16:33.875
We tried to get ready for it.
Though our clues were pathectically few.

16:34.220 --> 16:38.722
The Speed of an Alpha particle is between
9 and 20,000 miles a second.

16:39.193 --> 16:40.795
Applying standard procedure..

16:40.930 --> 16:46.737
We measured the speed and distance of the
radioactive particles emitted by the empty
container we'd found in the attic.

16:47.372 --> 16:51.911
Next we analysed dust particles
and finger nail scrapings taken
from the dead man.

16:56.785 --> 17:00.457
Without a sample of the element itself,
we could only hope for the best.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.021
From the film plate of the spectrum
of an element

17:05.299 --> 17:08.571
It is possible with amazing accuracy
to obtain the isotopes'

17:08.607 --> 17:11.769
unit charge and atomic weight
of a substance.

17:12.810 --> 17:16.108
The Spectrograph of our dust particles
was carefully examined

17:16.449 --> 17:19.678
But the test yielded results
we'd never seen before.

17:20.188 --> 17:24.311
In desperation we decided to submit
our findings to the Electronic Brain.

17:25.195 --> 17:28.329
Our calculations were forwarded
by long distance telephone

17:28.599 --> 17:33.869
Received by the input unit and automatically
recorded for assimilation by The Brain.

17:34.241 --> 17:38.237
While our findings were being coded
and the computations punched on cards

17:38.649 --> 17:42.553
The extensive library of every
basic element and radioactive substance

17:42.689 --> 17:45.121
known to man was systematically examined.

17:45.258 --> 17:47.052
If a similar element existed

17:47.195 --> 17:50.427
it would be found among the thousands
of facts available to the machines that

17:50.499 --> 17:53.766
comprised the system known as 'The Maniac'.

17:54.906 --> 17:57.098
Finally the tabulations were
double-checked

17:57.176 --> 18:00.271
against our mathematical description
of the element

18:00.381 --> 18:03.177
that had already taken the life of one man.

18:03.652 --> 18:04.452
Unless we were able to stop it,

18:04.487 --> 18:07.754
It's radioactivity would remain
a constant threat.

18:08.226 --> 18:10.320
Our problem was fed to 'The Brain'.

18:10.862 --> 18:13.458
An automatically sequenced computer

18:14.033 --> 18:16.165
employing a high speed
cathode ray memory unit.

18:16.436 --> 18:19.631
'The Maniac' sings with weird
voices when it is working.

18:22.112 --> 18:23.708
But even under skilled guidance

18:24.115 --> 18:26.180
It faltered and was silent.

18:26.252 --> 18:29.690
Frustrated by an unknown
element that could kill.

18:30.258 --> 18:31.723
1.15 pm

18:32.961 --> 18:34.840
Every means of communication was
used to inform the city

18:34.864 --> 18:38.165
that a dangerously radioactive
element was at large.

18:38.936 --> 18:42.702
The public, and all federal and civilian
agencies were instructed

18:42.878 --> 18:45.812
to report immediately any disturbances
in home appliances

18:45.982 --> 18:48.473
radio, television,...

18:49.220 --> 18:51.621
Radar Screens and scopes,...

18:51.690 --> 18:53.521
High frequency equipment,

18:53.926 --> 18:55.656
Telephone service,

18:55.762 --> 18:57.629
Western Union facilities,

18:57.965 --> 19:00.799
and all types of electrical equipment.

19:01.639 --> 19:06.304
Every 15 minutes Dr Allard and myself
took turns broadcasting on the radio

19:06.378 --> 19:08.142
Ladies and gentlemen..

19:08.447 --> 19:10.780
We are conducting a scientific test

19:10.851 --> 19:13.116
Please let us know at once

19:13.589 --> 19:16.754
If any of your watches
or clocks have been magnetic.

19:16.827 --> 19:20.093
Should you discover any magnetism
coming from metallic objects

19:20.465 --> 19:23.402
like your car, your toolbox,

19:23.804 --> 19:28.004
or your electrical equipments,

19:28.111 --> 19:31.073
Call Ogden 22-22.
Ogden 22-22.

19:48.206 --> 19:51.336
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I heard you.

19:51.479 --> 19:54.347
I wrote it down.
You'll hear from us.

19:55.116 --> 19:58.716
He says the battery of his hearing aid burned
out and he wants us to look into the matter.

19:58.988 --> 20:01.386
Oh fun.
What are these, more addresses?

20:01.860 --> 20:04.658
- About 2 dozen.
- I've already checked 3 dozen.

20:05.131 --> 20:06.927
Oh I'm worn in, done out, beat.

20:07.501 --> 20:11.201
Dr. Forbes, Dr. Allard told
me to give this to you.

20:12.141 --> 20:15.181
Have the police get in touch with those
people, Let them check the addresses.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.753
And ehm, sweatheart keep
the intercom switched on.

20:20.754 --> 20:23.791
Your Television set doesn't work?
Where do you live?

20:23.826 --> 20:26.921
What do they think we are?
Repairmen for broken down equipment?

20:27.699 --> 20:30.134
Office of scientific Investigation.

20:30.435 --> 20:34.534
- White spots on your TV screen?
- White spots? That cars going by.

20:34.609 --> 20:37.635
- Anything significant?
- No. All blind alleys.

20:41.853 --> 20:43.845
Teletype from Washington.

20:44.290 --> 20:48.387
No Radioactive matter reported
missing from any, from any plant.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.531
Well that settles that.

20:51.901 --> 20:53.995
Office of scientific Investigation.

20:54.137 --> 20:58.175
- I drive a cab and I heard your broadcast.
- Yes? Please go on.

20:58.810 --> 21:01.714
Look. I just dropped a fare at the
airport but my cab acts kind of funny.

21:02.049 --> 21:03.850
She stopped on me, won't start.

21:04.185 --> 21:05.185
Listen to this.

21:05.253 --> 21:09.885
I just got a brand new battery
I know about cars, checked her.

21:09.961 --> 21:11.201
But she deader than a mackerel.

21:11.668 --> 21:14.572
But we can't fix your cab.
Please call your garage.

21:15.074 --> 21:20.035
- They wouldn't know what to do, the motor's
froze. My screwdriver sticks to the block.

21:20.444 --> 21:21.820
- His Motor's become magnetic.
- Yeh.

21:21.844 --> 21:23.844
- This may be it.
- Nelly, switch his call in here.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.411
Hello this is Dr. Stewart, speaking.
Where are you located?

21:27.685 --> 21:29.182
At the airport, South gate.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.490
Your Licence number?

21:30.525 --> 21:35.029
- 7-Z-1456.
- 7-Z-1456.

21:35.264 --> 21:37.598
Stay right where you are.
I'm coming out.

21:37.733 --> 21:40.197
Stay where I am?
Are you kiddin'. I can't move!

21:44.177 --> 21:45.793
Take a look at this Jeff.

21:45.794 --> 21:50.117
Air terminal reports extreme interference
radar and radio communication.

21:51.321 --> 21:53.813
- Well that's it alright.
I'd better get out there.
- Right.

21:54.393 --> 21:57.888
I'll call the airfield and tell the
office you'll be there in 20 minutes.

21:58.097 --> 22:01.381
- Report back if you need any assistance.
- Right, Chief. Dan, bring a Geiger counter.

22:01.405 --> 22:02.303
Right, with you.

22:02.338 --> 22:05.239
Dr Stewart called, don't forget you
have a date with her tonight.

22:07.245 --> 22:10.045
Call her and tell her not to leave
the house. Tell her to stay at home.

22:11.918 --> 22:14.319
I'm sorry, Nelly.
Please give her that message.

22:41.095 --> 22:43.326
AIRPORT SUPERVISOR

22:44.999 --> 22:47.231
- Where'd you pick him up?
- At 7th and Hill.

22:47.670 --> 22:51.108
- What time was it when he left your cab?
- I don't know for sure, my watch stopped.

22:51.143 --> 22:55.240
- He didn't say which plane he wanted to catch?
- No, but I got out of here about 5 O'clock..

22:55.350 --> 22:58.722
We've had about 14 planes leave during
that hour. That's a lot of planes to stop.

22:58.757 --> 23:00.154
What'd he look like?

23:00.255 --> 23:03.091
Well usually I don't take a good
look at my fares in the daytime..

23:03.161 --> 23:06.188
Of course at night it's different.
But he was no kid.

23:06.299 --> 23:07.299
How old?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.861
Oh, about 60.
He carried a large brown suitcase.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.340
You know the kind of a case that opens
on top, more like a brief case.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.248
- It was pretty heavy.
- Did you lift it?

23:17.283 --> 23:19.364
No, he wouldn't let me near it.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.530
But I could tell it was heavy
by the way he carried it.

23:21.554 --> 23:24.291
He seemed nervous.
He fumbled when he kinda

23:24.326 --> 23:26.995
paid me the money, he put the
case between his feet.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.667
He seemed to be afraid somebody
would steal it.

23:30.102 --> 23:33.070
- Thats about all can remember.
- Yeh, alright thanks very much.

23:33.105 --> 23:36.701
- Eh, what'd the old guy do, rob a bank?
- No, thanks for your help.

23:36.978 --> 23:40.979
You never can tell what you get in a cab
now a days. Yesterday a fella got in my
hack with a Kangaroo.

23:42.217 --> 23:44.888
You know, I quit driving a
gasoline truck,..

23:44.923 --> 23:47.051
Thought it was too dangerous.

24:16.469 --> 24:17.960
What'd you want me to do?

24:18.105 --> 24:20.875
Can you instruct all planes
to land at the nearest airport?

24:20.910 --> 24:22.976
I haven't got the authority.

24:23.011 --> 24:26.393
Then get permission. All the planes
would have reached their destination
before I got through.

24:26.417 --> 24:29.719
- All except one.
- After all there's a chance he
didn't take a plane?

24:29.754 --> 24:33.784
Now look, look. Very soon the airplane
that he's in is going to crash.

24:34.695 --> 24:35.396
How soon?

24:35.431 --> 24:38.060
It all depends on how far the
briefcase is from the motors.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.568
What do you mean?

24:39.603 --> 24:41.280
If he's sitting in one of the
forward seats,

24:41.304 --> 24:44.619
the magnetism is going to take
hold at any time and the motors
are going to conk out.

24:44.643 --> 24:46.822
If he's sitting back towards the tail,
there may be some delay.

24:46.846 --> 24:50.148
Now will you please put that order
through? My responsibility!

24:50.752 --> 24:54.019
Alright, I'll order all planes to
land at the next emergency field.

24:54.358 --> 24:55.792
Get me the Control Tower please.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.495
- Jeff.
- Dan!

24:57.530 --> 24:59.931
- I think I know which plane our man is on.
- Yeh, which one?

24:59.966 --> 25:02.765
- We'll find out in a minute, come on quick!
- Coming, Mr. Smith?

25:03.104 --> 25:04.902
Cancel the call please.

25:08.012 --> 25:11.039
Excuse me please.
Jeff, check the counter.

25:13.386 --> 25:17.292
- Wow, definitely radioactive!
- Our man took out an insurance policy.
- No wonder.

25:17.527 --> 25:20.828
- But how do you know?
- Whatever blank he signed will be plenty hot.

25:21.798 --> 25:24.667
This little machine is tracking
him down like a bloodhound.

25:25.937 --> 25:26.937
Getting warmer!

25:30.845 --> 25:31.845
There it is.

25:32.915 --> 25:35.050
Howard Denker, Flight 17.

25:35.085 --> 25:37.747
- 17 took off at 5-0-5.
- Can I get 17 back to the field.

25:38.089 --> 25:42.037
- Howard Denker, I know him he's a
research physicist at South western.
- Yes, I've heard of him, come on.

25:42.061 --> 25:43.061
Thankyou.

25:50.941 --> 25:52.476
I love to fly.

25:53.078 --> 25:56.072
It's the only sure cure for
my hay fever.

25:56.450 --> 25:58.817
I often take a trip just to stop it.

25:59.419 --> 26:02.186
I never feel as well as in a plane!

26:02.926 --> 26:07.331
I wrote to the company and suggested they
have special flights called 'Hay fever rides'.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.825
They'd make lots of money.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.235
Say, are you sick?

26:13.507 --> 26:16.307
Its, its the altitude.

26:17.748 --> 26:21.014
- Anything wrong sir?
- No. No.

26:21.286 --> 26:23.619
- Let me take your briefcase.
- No!

26:24.324 --> 26:25.985
Don't touch it.

26:27.662 --> 26:30.929
Wouldn't you like to sit further back.
You could rest better.

26:31.401 --> 26:35.032
Leave me...
Leave me alone, will you...

26:53.200 --> 26:55.135
Airport's calling.

26:55.537 --> 26:57.506
Flight 17.

26:58.206 --> 26:59.971
This is Flight 17, over.

27:00.378 --> 27:04.145
Return to the airfield at once.
Your engines might quit at any moment.

27:05.517 --> 27:08.043
What does he mean 'engines might quit'?

27:20.172 --> 27:21.573
That's the starboard engine.

27:21.642 --> 27:23.769
Tell them we're coming back.

27:23.845 --> 27:27.783
Captain, we've got a sick man onboard,
his gums are bleeding.

27:29.387 --> 27:32.552
Received message, returning.
Starboard engine cutting out.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.753
Have sick man aboard, over.

27:35.329 --> 27:39.097
He's suffering from radiation sickness.
Isolate him from the other passengers

27:39.268 --> 27:42.865
His briefcase contains dangerous
radioactive material.

27:42.974 --> 27:46.604
Push it as far back towards the
tail of the aircraft as you possibly can..

27:46.713 --> 27:49.615
Don't touch it with your hands.
Repeat.

27:49.683 --> 27:51.948
Do not touch it with your hands.

27:52.254 --> 27:55.986
An ambulance and decontamination squad
will standby at the airfield.

27:56.359 --> 27:59.024
Hope your engines will make it.
Good luck.

27:59.098 --> 28:00.359
Over and out.

28:00.432 --> 28:02.162
Take over.

28:03.938 --> 28:07.272
- Good thing we're not over the Rockies.
- I'll take care of that briefcase.

28:11.483 --> 28:14.748
- This man here.
- Ok, get away from him till
I can move that briefcase.

28:16.422 --> 28:18.984
Excuse me, eh, I've got to
borrow your cane.

28:25.403 --> 28:29.569
Just, just keep in your seats folks. Don't
be alarmed, everything will be alright

28:38.187 --> 28:41.523
Fasten your seatbelts please.
We're going to make a landing.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.294
Everything will be alright.

29:15.909 --> 29:20.669
Alright, keep your seats folks.
Keep your seats, you'll be told
when you can leave the plane.
It'll be just a few minutes.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.809
- Where is it Captain?
- Right back there Sir.

29:23.986 --> 29:24.986
Come on.

29:34.101 --> 29:36.182
- Now where's the sick man?
- Up in front on the right.

29:36.206 --> 29:37.206
Doctor!

29:40.311 --> 29:42.258
Folks you may leave now
but please file out slowly.

29:42.282 --> 29:45.411
And let the passengers at the
rear of the plane come out first.

29:45.519 --> 29:46.519
Ar, you first mamm.

29:47.655 --> 29:48.687
Well, what's that for?

29:50.426 --> 29:53.426
You'd better let the stewardess
take you to the hospital mamm,
for a check up.

29:53.464 --> 29:55.184
- Hospital? I'm not sick!
- This way please.

29:55.334 --> 29:56.334
Dr. Denker?

29:58.271 --> 30:01.469
I'm Dr Stewart of the Office
of Scientific Investigations.

30:02.110 --> 30:05.038
Its, it's in my briefcase.

30:07.418 --> 30:08.458
Just a minute sir, please.

30:10.456 --> 30:12.705
I'm afraid we'll have to take
this cane away from you sir.

30:12.729 --> 30:14.009
- Would you help him out please?

30:15.229 --> 30:16.397
- What is it Dr Denker?

30:17.201 --> 30:22.203
Sereneum. A comparatively harmless
matter when I received it.

30:23.008 --> 30:24.101
What'd you do to it?

30:25.245 --> 30:27.114
I kept bombarding it with
Alpha particles.

30:28.248 --> 30:29.944
For 200 hours.

30:30.118 --> 30:32.484
It changed it's properties.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.459
It became unipolar, magnetic.

30:37.729 --> 30:38.822
Why didn't you report it?

30:39.133 --> 30:44.036
I didn't want to have any
interference with my experiment.

30:44.907 --> 30:48.443
I was afraid that others might
share my discovery.

30:49.714 --> 30:51.684
Why'd you take that laboratory
on Lincoln Street?

30:52.818 --> 30:56.482
I wanted to work unobserved
with my assistant.

30:57.392 --> 30:58.761
But that Sereneum...

30:59.796 --> 31:03.233
Turned out to be, unstable.

31:04.737 --> 31:08.907
When my assistant was killed...

31:09.277 --> 31:12.737
I tried to take it back to the laboratory.

31:13.682 --> 31:14.682
At the University.

31:14.985 --> 31:18.778
I'm still in full possession of
my mental faculties..

31:19.458 --> 31:21.525
I still know what I'm saying.

31:22.362 --> 31:24.195
Remember this, Stewart.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.561
Keep it under constant electric charge.

31:30.006 --> 31:31.766
Electric charge? Why?

31:32.043 --> 31:36.411
It's hungry. It has to be fed constantly.

31:37.250 --> 31:40.419
Or it will reach out it's magnetic arm..

31:41.355 --> 31:43.922
And grab at anything within it's reach,

31:44.394 --> 31:45.394
and kill it!

31:47.031 --> 31:50.398
It's monstrous, Stewart.
Monstrous!

31:51.303 --> 31:54.405
It grows bigger, and bigger.

31:54.810 --> 31:57.976
- How can it be stopped?
- I don't know.

32:00.584 --> 32:01.880
Other scientists...

32:02.954 --> 32:04.687
will have to find the solution.

32:07.127 --> 32:08.627
My contribution...

32:10.132 --> 32:11.496
is finished.

32:13.138 --> 32:15.407
I know this:

32:17.242 --> 32:19.436
In nuclear research

32:20.581 --> 32:25.542
there's no place for lone wolves.

32:32.266 --> 32:36.900
Specially trained technicians from
the State University prepared to
receive the element

32:37.105 --> 32:39.498
being transported ascross the
field under Police Guard.

32:40.310 --> 32:43.906
Every precaution was taken by the men
who would accompany the element on it's

32:44.000 --> 32:48.823
long journey, but even then, we
failed to realise the power of
Denker's creation.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.860
The element was reaching out
with invisible fingers

32:52.261 --> 32:55.564
gripping metallic objects with
terrifying strength

32:56.134 --> 32:59.765
We had no time to consider the reason for
Denker's experiment or what he had hoped

32:59.840 --> 33:04.676
to accomplish. Our main concern was
to remove the element from the airfield
as soon as we could.

33:06.182 --> 33:10.353
Working as quickly as possible the
technicians opened Denker's briefcase.

33:11.189 --> 33:12.255
Using non-magnetic tools

33:12.757 --> 33:15.237
They carefully removed the cylinder
containing the new element

33:15.297 --> 33:18.592
and transferred it to a case made
of special alloys,

33:19.201 --> 33:21.597
designed to prevent the spread
of radioactive particles.

33:24.309 --> 33:27.941
The Guards had not been required to wear
protective clothing due to their brief

33:28.082 --> 33:33.222
exposure to the element.
Yet they shared our relief in the fact that
the element was in a double container.

33:33.657 --> 33:35.888
For added protection, a
special lead-lined truck

33:35.960 --> 33:42.862
had been provided to contain any stray
radiation, while the element was en route
to it's destination

33:42.931 --> 33:44.571
The Cyclotron at the State University.

33:45.874 --> 33:46.874
Denker was right.

33:47.909 --> 33:52.474
In Nuclear research there is no
place for lone wolves.

33:53.251 --> 33:54.251
July 19th.

33:54.453 --> 33:59.556
Forbes and I had installed the element
in it's new home in the Cyclotron of the
State university,

33:59.627 --> 34:02.709
It was early morning by the time we'd
been checked through radiation quarantine

34:02.733 --> 34:05.167
and had made our report to Dr. Allard.

34:05.368 --> 34:08.204
As I approached home, and Connie,

34:08.438 --> 34:10.734
Denker's dying words
kept ringing in my ears

34:11.512 --> 34:13.646
"It will reach out with
it's magnetic arms.."

34:14.315 --> 34:18.148
"and grab anything within it's reach,
and kill it."

34:50.266 --> 34:52.560
Jeff, is that you Jeff?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.900
Were you expecting somebody else?

34:56.311 --> 34:58.678
You've been away for days.

34:59.549 --> 35:03.153
Don't I rate a kiss?
What kind of husband are you?

35:03.488 --> 35:06.823
The kind, kind. I wouldn't kiss any
girl with these whiskers on my face.

35:07.795 --> 35:09.092
Not even my own wife.

35:10.198 --> 35:12.469
- Why didn't you call me?
- You know what time it is?

35:12.904 --> 35:14.861
- No.
- 6.30 am.

35:18.177 --> 35:19.501
Oh darling,

35:20.880 --> 35:23.182
This is the most beautiful bedroom
in the world.

35:25.487 --> 35:28.716
Hey, what the doctor say?
When are you gonna start getting fat?

35:29.091 --> 35:31.072
- He said not for a while.
- Yeh, how long a while?

35:31.096 --> 35:34.831
He said some women never get fat
until the last 2 days. I may be the type.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.821
He doesn't know anything about babies.

35:39.707 --> 35:43.476
Today, we're gonna look for a house.

35:45.283 --> 35:45.983
What?

35:46.218 --> 35:47.887
I'm gonna take the day off.

35:49.056 --> 35:50.303
Jeff we can't afford a house!

35:50.338 --> 35:53.151
Our boy is gonna have a real
patch of grass and

35:53.362 --> 35:55.264
Sunshine and a real tree to climb in.

35:55.799 --> 35:59.136
I was brought up in an apartment
and I was a very healthy child.

35:59.437 --> 36:01.732
Skinny.
4th month and still skinny!

36:02.107 --> 36:04.176
- I am not skinny!
- I ought to know.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.381
He's gonna have a patch of
real green grass.

36:10.986 --> 36:13.021
You must be dead tired you poor darling.

36:13.925 --> 36:16.228
From now on I'm the boss.
We're gonna buy a house

36:16.431 --> 36:20.523
and you're gonna be fed under
my personal supervision.

36:21.235 --> 36:23.936
- Medical science says in the 4th month...
- And I say..

36:24.507 --> 36:28.845
Hot cakes, syrup, sausage,
white bread

36:28.913 --> 36:31.216
- If you say so.
- I say so.

36:37.394 --> 36:39.992
Police cars with loud speakers,
television announcements

36:40.065 --> 36:44.102
I tell you for 24 hours I was the
most important guy in this town.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.471
Of course you're a very important person.

36:46.539 --> 36:50.173
You've saved many many lives and I'm sure
they'll give you a medal, but never a raise.

36:50.246 --> 36:51.766
We can buy that house without a raise.

36:51.816 --> 36:55.411
That element, that Dan and you recovered?
Where'd you take it?

36:56.554 --> 37:00.252
To the State University for observation.
I'm through with it thank heaven.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.261
Now let me see,

37:03.164 --> 37:04.664
We've got 3,000...

37:06.102 --> 37:09.731
- 3,000 in the bank.
- 2,883.

37:09.808 --> 37:11.241
Alright, alright, alright..

37:11.509 --> 37:14.245
A 1,000 dollars for a
down payment on a GI house.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.583
- Money for the hospital.
- Yeh, I figure on 300.

37:17.618 --> 37:21.286
Figure on 500.
And we need a nurse for
a few days who can cook.

37:21.557 --> 37:22.557
I can cook.

37:26.732 --> 37:28.997
1,000 dollars for a down payment
on the furniture.

37:30.305 --> 37:32.185
But darling, we're not figuring
on having twins.

37:32.342 --> 37:35.148
Well, what about carpets, drapes?

37:35.283 --> 37:36.732
We don't want the neighbours looking
into our living room.

37:36.756 --> 37:43.283
What we need is a patch of grass, a backyard with a few miles
of sunshine above it. The rest will take care of itself slowly.

37:44.593 --> 37:45.624
Very slowly.

37:48.197 --> 37:50.210
Say, what happens if you're transferred
to another place?

37:50.234 --> 37:53.199
You're a Government employee.
And portable.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.297
Darling, stop worrying.

37:56.142 --> 37:56.742
Now look!

37:57.044 --> 37:58.444
You've eaten all your pancakes.

37:59.079 --> 38:00.645
We'll have a fat sassy baby.

38:00.783 --> 38:03.150
You just let me handle things
and everything'll work out.

38:03.987 --> 38:07.186
- I married a genius.
- And a great lover.

38:07.229 --> 38:08.229
Huh!

38:09.900 --> 38:14.564
Don't answer it, please Jeff. Remember
you're taking the day off to look for
a house with a backyard..

38:14.605 --> 38:16.864
A patch of grass and a mortgage.

38:23.818 --> 38:24.818
Hello?

38:25.653 --> 38:27.053
Oh yes Dr. Allard.

38:29.257 --> 38:30.257
What?

38:35.267 --> 38:36.763
Yes sir, I'll be right over.

38:42.578 --> 38:44.218
There was an explosion at the University.

38:44.349 --> 38:45.507
How bad?

38:47.752 --> 38:48.752
Very!

38:51.290 --> 38:52.290
Dr. Chase was killed.

38:53.296 --> 38:56.264
- And Freddy Lipton. You know Freddy.
- Well that's terrible.

38:56.999 --> 38:59.733
It was that same thing that killed Dr.
Denker.

38:59.803 --> 39:01.465
- Oh Jeff...
- I know, I'll be careful.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.837
I've gotta come back to both of you.

39:13.189 --> 39:14.817
8:16 am.

39:15.126 --> 39:19.121
The Score: 4 murders in 2 days.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.965
Cause of death, the element was hungry.

39:24.173 --> 39:27.202
When I arrived at the Office
of Scientific investigation

39:27.677 --> 39:29.248
The entrance was blocked

39:29.549 --> 39:34.115
The autogates shut. There'd never been a
reason to evacuate the entire area before.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.448
Apparently the guard at the gate
knew less about it than I did.

39:42.165 --> 39:45.966
Inside the corridor was empty,
the desks deserted.

39:46.840 --> 39:50.235
It gave an eerie sombre feeling
to O.S.I.

40:09.672 --> 40:12.952
We received the element from your office
and treated it as highly explosive matter.

40:13.378 --> 40:16.177
Unfortunately the instructions we
received did not prevent the disaster.

40:16.201 --> 40:18.177
Gentlemen meet Dr Stewart.

40:18.185 --> 40:20.915
Captain Dryer, of the department
of civilian defence

40:21.123 --> 40:23.527
- Dr. Serny, of State university
- Oh yes, how do you do.

40:23.762 --> 40:26.726
Dr. Stewart,
Can you give us an explanation?

40:27.166 --> 40:29.461
First I need an explanation Colonel.
Why the roadblock?

40:29.969 --> 40:31.528
Why the explosion?

40:31.972 --> 40:34.569
- It wasn't an explosion.
- That building collapsed on the Campus.

40:34.593 --> 40:38.845
A Cyclotron that Government funds helped pay for out
of tax payer's money was smashed to smitheerines.

40:39.251 --> 40:42.085
- What do you call that if not an explosion?
- Nonsense gentlemen!

40:42.120 --> 40:45.020
It was an inverted explosion.
An implosion.

40:45.192 --> 40:48.626
The walls were pulled inward by
some unbelievable force.

40:49.765 --> 40:52.057
Girders were bent,
Rivets were pulled out...

40:52.437 --> 40:56.430
All metal parts within a radius
of 100 yards became magnetic.

40:57.109 --> 41:01.009
Look, Colonel.
This is a bolt from one of the girders.

41:01.183 --> 41:02.245
Now watch.

41:05.223 --> 41:08.185
Why, I've never seen anything
like that in my life!

41:10.029 --> 41:11.029
What is that?

41:11.164 --> 41:15.665
A piece of steel has been magnetised
by some radioactive element.
So far, undefined.

41:16.304 --> 41:18.624
We placed it in our vacuum chamber.
Forbes is watching it.

41:18.675 --> 41:21.407
Oh it's quiet now but heavenly only
knows when it will react again.

41:21.879 --> 41:25.125
But you have no right to keep a highly
dangerous substance in the centre of the City!

41:25.149 --> 41:26.869
My instructions are to find out what it is.

41:27.188 --> 41:29.852
What happens if it explodes again,
while you do your research?

41:29.924 --> 41:32.788
Then captain, it becomes the
responsibility of our successors.

41:33.397 --> 41:34.397
Dr. Serny,...

41:35.267 --> 41:39.827
Did you, did you notice any difference
in the element after the implosion?

41:40.641 --> 41:41.641
Yes.

41:42.676 --> 41:45.070
Its hard to say because it's
so hard to believe.

41:45.815 --> 41:47.055
It defies every law of physics.

41:48.386 --> 41:49.445
It doubled it's size...

41:50.554 --> 41:53.126
Then lost it's magnetism
and it's radioactivity.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.187
Denker was right.
It's unipolar magnetic.

41:57.197 --> 42:00.634
Constantly growing, doubling it's mass.
Growing larger and larger.

42:00.669 --> 42:03.441
But this is ridiculous,
metal objects can't grow!

42:05.009 --> 42:08.369
- Yes?
- This is Forbes. I'm ready with the samples.

42:08.548 --> 42:09.588
We'll be over right away..

42:10.316 --> 42:14.249
We'll examine the element under
the electronic microscope. Will
you gentlemen please follow me.

42:16.794 --> 42:18.234
Turn out the light Captain, please..

42:20.733 --> 42:21.860
Maximum vacuum, Dr. Stewart.

43:00.625 --> 43:01.822
It's Extraordinary!

43:09.170 --> 43:10.241
Look, they're multiplying.

43:11.544 --> 43:12.944
They're forming rings of their own.

43:13.648 --> 43:19.211
Adding new structure to the old.
Doubling their size.
Growing larger and larger.

43:22.157 --> 43:23.197
You know what's happening?

43:24.994 --> 43:27.661
Mass is forming in
supposedly empty space!

43:30.602 --> 43:31.602
I don't follow.

43:33.139 --> 43:37.408
Energys' being drawn into space
transforming itself into mass.

43:38.815 --> 43:39.815
What does it mean?

43:48.629 --> 43:49.629
They're like planets.

43:50.199 --> 43:53.162
This process might have been
the origin of the solar system.

43:54.871 --> 43:55.871
Yes, gentlemen.

43:57.208 --> 43:59.037
We're witnessing the secret of creation..

44:01.316 --> 44:03.581
Diameter of the molecule:

44:05.321 --> 44:07.813
45 thousandths of one millimetre.

44:11.128 --> 44:12.188
Cycle of multiplication:

44:13.299 --> 44:17.998
4 seconds and 4 tenths.

44:35.163 --> 44:38.194
This growing process follows a
straight mathematical progression.

44:39.370 --> 44:42.773
- It's amazing.
- Amazing to me we didn't explode.

44:44.811 --> 44:45.811
What's next?

44:47.215 --> 44:49.981
We'll run the tests and communicate
the data to "Maniac".

44:50.516 --> 44:53.749
- Who's the 'Maniac'?
- M.A.N.I.A.C.,

44:54.225 --> 44:57.665
Mathematical Analyser Numerical
Integrator and Computer.

44:57.700 --> 45:01.193
- You mean the giant brain machine?
- 'MANIAC', in short.

45:01.903 --> 45:02.903
8:55

45:03.973 --> 45:05.973
With a sample of the element
to work with at last..

45:06.878 --> 45:08.643
We began a series of exhaustive tests.

45:09.715 --> 45:12.715
Our first move was to check
it's chemical composition,

45:12.821 --> 45:15.783
Critical mass, density and
point of saturation.

45:16.458 --> 45:19.060
Measuring the emission of
it's Alpha and Beta particles

45:19.099 --> 45:22.362
was almost beyond the scope of the
Geiger Counter's scaling unit.

45:23.002 --> 45:25.429
But testing it under extremely
high frequencies

45:25.706 --> 45:29.410
we were able to ascertain the exact
strength of it's magnetic field.

45:30.512 --> 45:33.414
The response of the element bore
out Denker's statement.

45:33.817 --> 45:35.884
It was of a highly unstable nature

45:36.223 --> 45:39.250
Its wavelength yielded frequencies

45:39.394 --> 45:42.125
well above 2 million megacycles
per second.

45:42.831 --> 45:45.690
Intense heat enabled us to
photograph it's spectrum,

45:45.869 --> 45:49.602
and three hours later we had
compiled all the information possible.

45:50.176 --> 45:52.743
Our next step was to consult
the M.A.N.I.A.C.

45:53.478 --> 45:55.358
At last we were coming close
to a true picture..

45:55.850 --> 45:59.017
Of the monster Denker had
blundered into existence.

46:00.623 --> 46:02.217
The problems are broken down in code..

46:03.060 --> 46:06.340
You must feed them, to the computer as soon
as possible and teletype us the results.

46:06.698 --> 46:08.263
There can't be any delay.

46:09.101 --> 46:12.365
The total problem, data as follows...

46:13.410 --> 46:15.211
Energy: 0011.

46:17.048 --> 46:19.717
Time of Cycle: 1001.

46:21.554 --> 46:24.692
Atomic weight: 10011.

46:26.061 --> 46:28.263
Radiation: 10100.

46:29.031 --> 46:32.330
11:55
Last minute preparations were made.

46:33.071 --> 46:34.637
Our coded results were checked,

46:35.242 --> 46:36.375
and re-checked.

46:37.578 --> 46:39.641
Finally, everything was ready.

46:41.216 --> 46:43.284
The computer was awakened
from it's slumber,

46:43.921 --> 46:46.458
and the data fed into the brain
of the M.A.N.I.A.C.

46:47.093 --> 46:49.497
It was a matter of time,
until whether we would know

46:49.566 --> 46:52.628
Whether we had succeeded or failed.

46:55.806 --> 46:57.405
This is worse than waiting for a baby.

47:01.011 --> 47:04.183
It's almost 6. I've got to
relieve Dan in the vacuum chamber.

47:04.218 --> 47:07.055
I'll call you as soon as I get
the information from the M.A.N.I.A.C.

47:07.190 --> 47:08.190
Ok, chief.

47:10.826 --> 47:11.826
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.858
- Brought you some Java.
- Yo!

47:14.500 --> 47:16.633
- Nothing yet?
- No.

47:17.036 --> 47:19.802
- Any word from the M.A.N.I.A.C?
- Not yet.

47:26.684 --> 47:28.218
Jeff, what do you think?

47:30.856 --> 47:31.856
I don't dare say it.

47:32.893 --> 47:36.429
- Afraid?
- Sure, aren't you?

47:41.205 --> 47:42.264
What's that?

47:45.178 --> 47:46.178
Dan, Look!

47:48.682 --> 47:49.876
Magnetic field's increasing!

48:04.773 --> 48:05.935
It's actually growing!

48:07.610 --> 48:09.242
Jeff, that's alive thing!

48:10.080 --> 48:12.742
If it's growing it's feeding
on something.

48:13.319 --> 48:15.185
And if it's not being fed..

48:15.288 --> 48:18.657
It implodes and draws energy
from surrounding matter.

48:19.394 --> 48:21.454
And turns that into mass.

48:22.533 --> 48:24.868
Nuclei and electrons form matter.

48:25.403 --> 48:28.667
Let's feed that thing electrons,
it's our only chance Dan, let's try it.

48:30.177 --> 48:31.909
Increase the voltage.

48:32.748 --> 48:33.748
Go on give it more.

48:36.084 --> 48:37.253
Give it maximum output.

48:47.936 --> 48:48.936
That's it.

49:04.628 --> 49:05.754
Jeff, look.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.306
It's quiet again.

49:20.117 --> 49:21.913
Yeh, for the time being.

49:24.190 --> 49:26.918
- Serny was right.
- About what?

49:30.098 --> 49:31.731
It's doubled it's size.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.334
And it's appetite.

49:39.347 --> 49:40.506
Yes?

49:41.717 --> 49:45.154
Right chief.
Allen's got the M.A.N.I.A.C on
the wire, give me my coat.

49:46.824 --> 49:48.416
Here it is gentlemen.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.187
Energy gained per cycle
500 Million Hertz.

49:52.866 --> 49:55.859
Unstable. Unipolar.

49:56.270 --> 49:58.866
Cycles of Implosion: 11 hours.

49:59.709 --> 50:02.346
It will double it's size
every 11 hours.

50:02.381 --> 50:04.849
The last implosion was at
7 O'clock this morning.

50:04.884 --> 50:08.254
- The next one is due at 6 O'clock.
- 6.30 now.

50:08.289 --> 50:10.723
There you are, the whole thing
is a miscalculation.

50:10.791 --> 50:12.260
No captain.

50:12.627 --> 50:15.223
There was an implosion at 6,
but we stopped it.

50:15.833 --> 50:19.770
And there'll be another one at 5
in the morning, only double it's size.

50:21.609 --> 50:24.601
Gentlemen we have 10 hours and 30 minutes.

50:27.116 --> 50:31.953
While Forbes kept watch on the element, I
attended an all night session at City Hall.

50:32.023 --> 50:34.492
Scheduled implosion at 5 the next morning

50:34.527 --> 50:37.259
Would be met with all the available
power in the city

50:37.365 --> 50:40.067
Radio and TV stations remained on the air

50:40.102 --> 50:44.040
To inform the public that a special test
was to be made the following morning.

50:45.177 --> 50:46.405
Ladies and gentlemen,

50:46.511 --> 50:50.505
In 10 minutes we're suspending our
telecast for a period of 30 minutes.

50:50.751 --> 50:54.920
The Department of Power and Light informed us
that the City will go dark for a half hour.

50:54.955 --> 50:59.090
We tried to contact the Mayor's office
but we were refused explanation.

51:00.331 --> 51:03.919
Gentlemen, as Mayor of this city,

51:03.954 --> 51:07.507
You see what I'm up against!
Mr Mayor the City must go dark to
supply the power we need.

51:07.576 --> 51:10.011
And after 11 hours, what then?

51:10.112 --> 51:12.883
Then we'll need the entire power
of Bolder Dam to feed it.

51:12.918 --> 51:15.548
We must make preparation to
evacuate the city.

51:15.622 --> 51:19.080
How can we evacuate 4 million
people in a few hours?

51:19.427 --> 51:20.872
What's the limit of it's growth?

51:20.896 --> 51:24.355
There is no limit, General.
It'll grow larger and larger.

51:24.601 --> 51:27.731
- Doubling it's size with each cycle.
- But what would happen?

51:28.074 --> 51:29.267
Look.

51:29.609 --> 51:33.205
As long as the earth remains in
Equilibrium, nothing will change.

51:33.781 --> 51:37.185
But very soon, this element is
going to make the Earth eccentric,

51:37.220 --> 51:40.590
It's gonna fly out of it's orbit.
Into space!

51:45.599 --> 51:47.429
You can't be serious?

51:47.735 --> 51:49.863
Mr Mayor, we're stating facts.

51:52.575 --> 51:54.840
How large is our supply of electricity?

51:54.978 --> 51:58.246
600,000 kilowatts for the whole city.

51:58.585 --> 52:00.419
Well let's shoot it into space.

52:00.454 --> 52:02.858
Far as I know Sir, we don't
possess a rocket that powerful.

52:02.893 --> 52:04.691
What about dumping it into the ocean?

52:04.726 --> 52:06.854
In a matter of weeks the ocean
would turn into steam.

52:06.963 --> 52:09.661
Isn't there some way to stop it's growth?

52:09.734 --> 52:11.726
Yes, Mr Mayor, theoretically.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.973
If we could use it's own power,
bombard it with that power,

52:15.008 --> 52:18.881
over feed it until it burst,
and fissioned into 2 stable elements

52:18.916 --> 52:21.077
You mean elements that are not cancerous?

52:21.685 --> 52:23.711
How many volts would it take to split it?

52:23.789 --> 52:25.758
According to the M.A.N.I.A.C, ,

52:26.960 --> 52:29.225
900 million Volts..

52:29.730 --> 52:32.632
- There isn't a generator that powerful.
- That's right.

52:32.768 --> 52:33.792
Wait!

52:34.670 --> 52:37.938
The Canadian Government operate
a top secret plant in Nova Scotia

52:38.177 --> 52:41.064
They own the most powerful
Deltatron in existence.

52:41.099 --> 52:43.952
When they realise the common danger,
they'll let us use it

52:43.987 --> 52:47.149
Nova Scotia is 4000 miles away.

52:47.624 --> 52:50.686
The period between cycles is 11 hours.

52:50.762 --> 52:53.130
How are we going to transport
it there in that time?

52:53.165 --> 52:55.601
Our jets travel at 600 miles an hour.

52:55.636 --> 53:00.235
And what's more the new alloys we
use in our jets are non-magnetic.
They'll not be affected by the cargo.

53:00.709 --> 53:03.907
You Dr. Stewart and Forbes can follow
in another plane, just in case.

53:05.017 --> 53:08.385
Operator, This is General Behan.
Give me Washington,

53:08.521 --> 53:10.786
Connect me with the
Secretary of Defence.

53:11.125 --> 53:14.426
I like this world.
Let's keep it in one piece.

53:15.297 --> 53:16.890
Or at least let's try.

53:50.083 --> 53:53.542
July 21, 7.45am.

53:54.389 --> 53:58.794
We had sapped the strength of
the city to keep a monster alive.

53:58.929 --> 54:02.890
The element had been fed, and
for the time being was at rest.

54:03.469 --> 54:06.303
The Air Command supplied us
with Jet Aircraft,

54:06.474 --> 54:08.705
One for Forbes and myself,

54:09.376 --> 54:10.777
and one for the element.

54:11.481 --> 54:15.220
It had quadrupled it's size
and due to it's increasing density,

54:15.255 --> 54:18.816
we were no longer able to extract
a sample even for test purposes.

54:19.492 --> 54:23.453
A new cylinder had been fashioned
from a combination of special alloys.

54:23.664 --> 54:26.999
We were able to contain the strength
of the element's magnetic field

54:27.070 --> 54:30.598
and lessen the degree of it's
radiation but like a chained beast

54:30.675 --> 54:34.237
it had the power to break lose
in an unpredictable frenzy.

54:34.716 --> 54:38.086
The element was loaded into the plane
for the trip that we hoped would carry it

54:38.121 --> 54:40.682
to final and total destruction.

54:43.394 --> 54:48.265
Forbes and I had already taken off
in the jet bomber that had been placed
at our disposal by the Air Command.

54:48.635 --> 54:54.474
Ours was a fast ship, but no match for
the pursuit job that was to carry the
element to its destination.

54:55.245 --> 54:57.407
By placing the element in the plane,

54:57.549 --> 55:02.147
The technicians from State university
had fulfilled their end of the bargain.

55:02.289 --> 55:04.554
The rest was up to the pilot.

55:22.651 --> 55:25.884
8:43 am, the element was airborne.

55:27.093 --> 55:30.551
We'd made countless tests with the
monster Denker had created,

55:30.797 --> 55:35.100
But we didn't know how it would react to the
sudden acceleration of a jet fighter plane.

55:35.571 --> 55:38.097
Fortunately, or unfortunately,

55:38.542 --> 55:41.308
The pilot would be the
only one who could tell us.

55:42.114 --> 55:45.310
11:17 am, somewhere over Kansas,

55:46.519 --> 55:50.893
The fighter had dropped it's wing tanks and
prepared to take on fuel while in flight

55:50.928 --> 55:53.989
to save the one important factor, time.

55:56.101 --> 55:57.967
If the element was hungry,

55:58.070 --> 56:01.269
It would have to wait until
the fighter quenched it's thirst.

56:13.293 --> 56:15.285
Our bomber was next.

56:30.018 --> 56:32.544
Finally our tanks were full.

56:33.690 --> 56:36.023
Time: 11:51.

56:36.093 --> 56:38.561
Destination: Nova Scotia.

56:38.596 --> 56:41.032
What we'd do there we didn't know for sure.

56:41.067 --> 56:45.905
If we got there, we had exactly
1 hour and 35 minutes to find out.

56:52.218 --> 56:54.938
- They're here, the Americans.
- I hope they know what they're doing.

56:59.162 --> 57:00.490
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeh, this way.

57:11.114 --> 57:12.951
That's a hot potato you tossed us!

57:13.886 --> 57:15.918
I read you report you
sent over by Teletype.

57:16.521 --> 57:20.619
- I must say I am quite at a loss.
- That's why we're here Dr. Benton.

57:21.496 --> 57:24.693
- How far down are you taking us?
- 1700 feet.

57:25.266 --> 57:29.036
This is an old mine. The Government put us
down here in the interests of public safety.

57:29.740 --> 57:32.940
I've studied the specifications
of your Deltatron Dr.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.606
I hope it's powerful enough to do the job.

57:38.018 --> 57:40.385
What is the nature of your job?

57:42.625 --> 57:47.087
What's the maximum output of your machine,
your specifications didn't state it?

57:47.165 --> 57:49.532
600 million Volt maximum.

57:49.935 --> 57:51.234
That's all?

57:51.405 --> 57:54.341
The insulators haven't
been tested for more.

57:56.245 --> 57:58.714
We haven't time left to run a test.

58:13.471 --> 58:17.000
- It's cold down here!
- Yes, we're under the ocean floor.

58:17.076 --> 58:20.877
It's the deepest mineshaft we could
find. Just perfect for our purpose.

58:21.182 --> 58:23.617
- Safety reasons?
- Only partly.

58:23.886 --> 58:26.334
The sea water's almost at
freezing point down here.

58:26.369 --> 58:28.782
We need it to cool the Deltatron.

58:30.897 --> 58:34.390
Nice to see the sun again.
Patch of grass.

58:35.002 --> 58:38.872
For 11 years I've practically lived in
this hole under the Ocean Dr Stewart..

58:39.375 --> 58:41.844
Yes Dr. Benton I'm familiar with your work.

58:41.912 --> 58:45.145
Then you can understand my
apprehension, and curiosity.

58:45.651 --> 58:48.486
How do you plan to use my Deltatron?

58:49.624 --> 58:52.424
I'm going to try to kill
that thing we sent you.

58:52.996 --> 58:55.624
- How you going about it?
- Choke it.

58:55.799 --> 58:58.233
- I don't follow you.
- It feeds on energy.

58:58.303 --> 59:00.101
Our only chance it to over-feed it.

59:00.172 --> 59:03.474
Ram all available, power down it's throat.
Choke it to death.

59:03.578 --> 59:06.309
But if it can assimilate all the energy?

59:07.150 --> 59:08.242
What then?

59:08.719 --> 59:11.086
I'll leave that to your imagination.

59:28.916 --> 59:30.212
Open the floodgate.

59:33.223 --> 59:35.394
The Deltatron is beyond those doors.

59:35.929 --> 59:38.096
Safety checks begin?

59:38.100 --> 59:41.726
Just in case an explosion should blow
through the floor of the Ocean sometime.

59:41.902 --> 59:42.902
They're watertight.

01:00:06.138 --> 01:00:07.572
She's a brute ain't she?

01:00:07.607 --> 01:00:09.038
Took 11 years to build her.

01:00:13.582 --> 01:00:16.520
You say the maximum load would be
600 million Volts.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.015
That's the upper limit, although
we've never been that high.

01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:20.892
It's not high enough then.

01:00:21.927 --> 01:00:25.366
The Deltatron has an output
of 600 million Volts.

01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:27.747
That will be the upper limit
of your operating conditions.

01:00:29.706 --> 01:00:31.899
- Mind if I have a look?
- Go ahead.

01:00:52.807 --> 01:00:55.868
But I don't understand.
What's he got on his mind

01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:57.912
How much voltage is he gonna use?

01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:59.549
We consulted The M.A.N.I.A.C..

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:02.954
Here's the answer.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:15.296
But this is preposterous!
This is impossible

01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:18.369
I don't think the M.A.N.I.A.C
made a mistake.

01:01:20.982 --> 01:01:23.394
I don't question the M.A.N.I.A.C
but at this high voltage, the...

01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:26.415
Molecular movement can't be controlled.
There's no way of directing it.

01:01:27.925 --> 01:01:28.965
Do you have a better plan?

01:01:48.489 --> 01:01:49.489
What's up there?

01:01:50.993 --> 01:01:52.954
It's the Tele-metering Control Room.

01:01:53.663 --> 01:01:55.501
I'd better talk to
the Defence Minister.

01:01:58.572 --> 01:02:02.333
I won't take any responsibility for the
safety of the people and the equipment.

01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:05.881
But I must repeat
their lives are in danger.

01:02:10.555 --> 01:02:11.555
Very well Sir.

01:02:13.225 --> 01:02:14.225
I understand.

01:02:23.542 --> 01:02:25.644
- Cartwright here.
- Cartwright.

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.079
Yes Sir?

01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:30.746
Tell the Crew that Dr. Stewart
is in full charge.

01:02:31.819 --> 01:02:34.381
- They'll take orders from him.
- Yes Sir.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.231
Stewart,..

01:02:46.341 --> 01:02:48.304
How can you take such a personal risk?

01:02:51.849 --> 01:02:54.052
I'm gonna set the machine
and leave in time.

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:57.768
- So are the men.
- But she isn't built to take such a load!
- She'll break up!

01:02:58.025 --> 01:02:59.025
Dr. Benton,

01:02:59.428 --> 01:03:02.692
Our only hope is that she'll break that
element before she breaks herself.

01:03:23.464 --> 01:03:24.689
Start your Generators.

01:03:25.766 --> 01:03:27.764
Cut in Emergency Voltage when called for.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:32.399
Stand clear of the machine.
I'm gonna see how much it can take.

01:05:47.807 --> 01:05:52.178
I'm now going to set the Deltatron
at it's maximum output, and close
the flood gates.

01:05:52.347 --> 01:05:56.442
I want you all to leave. You've got
about 7 minutes to reach the surface.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.353
- What about you?
- I'll get out in time too.

01:05:59.559 --> 01:06:03.224
The flood gates will hold no matter
what happens. You'll be safe the other
side of them.

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:05.831
I'm now going to close those Gates.

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:08.910
You can't do that,
you can't do that!

01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:11.242
Benton, what are you doing up here?

01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:14.172
This is about listening to reason,
it's insanity what you're doing!

01:06:14.277 --> 01:06:15.892
Get out of here Benton,
I'm gonna close those Gates.

01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:17.850
But I implore you listen to me.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.582
Lock the remote controls
and come on down!

01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:13.433
Come back cowards!

01:07:14.502 --> 01:07:17.464
You know it can't be stopped now.
Come on, get out of here.

01:07:48.486 --> 01:07:51.884
Now you'll have to stop the Generators!
You'll have to!

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.427
You'll drown.
You and 400 men!
All of you!

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:21.421
The doors won't close, stay alive!
Get out!

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.233
Give me your big cutters!

01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:24.699
- Listen?
- Yeh.

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:27.573
Sill alive.

01:11:29.245 --> 01:11:30.941
- It's the end.

01:11:33.245 --> 01:11:34.245
- Come on.

01:12:00.757 --> 01:12:02.786
We did it, Dan.
We killed it!

01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:06.197
It's gone.

01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:10.597
It's gone forever.

01:12:44.789 --> 01:12:47.324
Hey! Not so skinny.
- I'm working on it,

01:12:47.726 --> 01:12:49.292
I'm getting bigger and better.

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:53.364
- The Secret of multiplication.
- What are you talking about?

01:12:54.071 --> 01:12:55.333
I'm not sure.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.105
Excepting they both seem to have
something to do with multiplication.

01:13:00.212 --> 01:13:03.980
Done through love the result
is a baby, a lovely thing.

01:13:05.153 --> 01:13:08.852
But without love,
and through hate or with fear,

01:13:09.326 --> 01:13:11.318
The result is a Monster.

01:13:11.396 --> 01:13:13.865
An element that grows.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.700
Jeff.....

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:37.300
