04:58.532 --> 04:59.965
how about if I took the cards,
and put them in new deck order,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.300
and put them in new deck order,
reverse the one card, put them

In the plastic?
>> Oh, that would be a fine

Inside, there is a paper seal.

Inside, there is a paper seal.
It says "United States playing

Look, I'm gonna pop open the

Inside, a brand-new deck of

Okay, yeah, that's perfect.

out.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.521
Out.
If you look at the deck,

05:56.523 --> 05:58.357
if you look at the deck,
there isn't a premium card on

05:58.359 --> 05:58.824
there isn't a premium card on
the end.

05:58.826 --> 05:59.691
The end.
Do you know why?

05:59.693 --> 06:00.359
Do you know why?
>> Why is that?

06:00.361 --> 06:01.560
>> Why is that?

>> Mm-hmm.
>> Let me get them out.

06:03.880 --> 06:04.629
>> Let me get them out.
There's a lot of them.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.864
There's a lot of them.
There's the jokers, and the

Premium card.
All of them were in here.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.369
All of them were in here.
That means that this should be a

06:10.371 --> 06:11.603
that means that this should be a
new deck ordered deck.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.538
New deck ordered deck.
Take a look and see if they run

06:12.539 --> 06:13.472

ace through king.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.229
Ace through king.
Oh, maybe you can turn this way,

06:14.230 --> 06:14.985
oh, maybe you can turn this way,
so the camera can see.

06:14.986 --> 06:15.741
So the camera can see.
>> Maybe I could.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.875
>> Maybe I could.
Someone who was a professional

06:16.877 --> 06:18.009
someone who was a professional
in show business would have done

06:18.011 --> 06:20.946
in show business would have done
that automatically.

06:20.948 --> 06:21.830
That automatically.
>> Now, when you get to the

06:21.831 --> 06:22.713
>> now, when you get to the
diamonds, do you notice one card

06:22.716 --> 06:23.548
diamonds, do you notice one card
is reversed?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.417
Is reversed?
>> I do, between the 8 and the

06:25.419 --> 06:26.852

6 of diamonds...

06:26.854 --> 06:27.636

you?

06:32.426 --> 06:33.392
You?
I'll just kind of pull it like

06:33.394 --> 06:34.559
I'll just kind of pull it like
that, lightly, and turn it

06:34.561 --> 06:35.827
that, lightly, and turn it
around like that so you can see

06:35.828 --> 06:37.094
around like that so you can see
that it really does have your

06:37.097 --> 06:37.763
that it really does have your
signature.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.698
Signature.

>> okay, so, I know you're not
going to tell us how you did it,

07:01.988 --> 07:02.987
going to tell us how you did it,
but that was unique.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.756
But that was unique.
Does anyone else do that?

07:03.757 --> 07:04.523
Does anyone else do that?
>> It's a trick.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.524
>> It's a trick.
It's my job.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.091
It's my job.

[Laughter]

07:07.561 --> 07:08.560
[Laughter]
I know you can't share, but

07:08.562 --> 07:09.161
I know you can't share, but
does anyone else do that

07:09.163 --> 07:10.529
does anyone else do that
particular technique?

07:10.531 --> 07:11.630
Particular technique?
>> No, there was a--not the

07:11.632 --> 07:12.497
>> no, there was a--not the
similar technique.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.698
Similar technique.
The same effect was a gentlemen

07:13.700 --> 07:14.733
the same effect was a gentlemen
by the name of George schindler

07:14.734 --> 07:15.767
by the name of George schindler
many years ago, now the Dean of

07:15.769 --> 07:16.902
many years ago, now the Dean of
American magicians.

07:16.904 --> 07:17.936
American magicians.
He inspired me, but I came up

07:17.938 --> 07:18.937
he inspired me, but I came up
with a completely different

07:18.939 --> 07:19.604
with a completely different
method.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.206
Method.
>> And that would be the key, I

07:21.208 --> 07:22.040
>> and that would be the key, I
guess, this evening, to fool

07:22.042 --> 07:22.941
guess, this evening, to fool
those guys, 'cause if it's a new

07:22.943 --> 07:24.042
those guys, 'cause if it's a new
method and they haven't seen it

07:24.043 --> 07:25.142
method and they haven't seen it
before, they can't put their

07:25.145 --> 07:26.511
before, they can't put their
finger on it, we'll get away

07:26.513 --> 07:28.480
finger on it, we'll get away
with it, and by we, I mean you,

07:28.482 --> 07:29.448
with it, and by we, I mean you,
of course, although I'd like

07:29.450 --> 07:30.882
of course, although I'd like
some of the reflected glory.

07:30.884 --> 07:31.817
Some of the reflected glory.
>> That's awesome.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.717
>> That's awesome.
I'll share.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.685
I'll share.
>> And is that one of the most

07:33.687 --> 07:34.586
>> and is that one of the most
technically difficult ones in

07:34.588 --> 07:35.954
technically difficult ones in
your routine to do?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.022
Your routine to do?
>> It is, in fact, not the most

07:37.024 --> 07:38.957
>> it is, in fact, not the most
technically difficult, but it's

07:38.959 --> 07:39.791
technically difficult, but it's
probably the most fun to

07:39.793 --> 07:40.926
probably the most fun to
present, because most of it

07:40.928 --> 07:42.027
present, because most of it
takes place in the spectator's

07:42.029 --> 07:43.562
takes place in the spectator's
hands, and I think magic that

07:43.564 --> 07:44.696
hands, and I think magic that
takes place in somebody else's

07:44.698 --> 07:45.864
takes place in somebody else's
hands is so much more powerful

07:45.866 --> 07:46.765
hands is so much more powerful
than magic that takes place in

07:46.767 --> 07:47.232
than magic that takes place in
our own.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.200
Our own.
>> That's what I tell my wife

07:48.202 --> 07:48.900

all the time.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.836
All the time.
>> That's true.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.804
>> That's true.
>> I'm learning some tricks at

home.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.541
Home.
That's all it is.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.242
That's all it is.
I think we have given you enough

07:57.244 --> 07:57.909
I think we have given you enough
time.

07:57.911 --> 07:58.577
Time.
Uh, penn?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.979
Uh, penn?
>> This is a really, really

08:00.981 --> 08:02.247

tough call for us.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.684
Tough call for us.
I think anybody has to know that

08:05.686 --> 08:06.985
I think anybody has to know that
at some point, you had to do a

08:06.987 --> 08:08.720
at some point, you had to do a
deck switch.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.890
Deck switch.
Unfortunately, there was a

08:11.892 --> 08:15.560
unfortunately, there was a
moment when we both saw it, when

08:15.562 --> 08:16.528
moment when we both saw it, when
you were pulling the pen out.

08:16.530 --> 08:16.995
You were pulling the pen out.
>> Yes.

08:16.997 --> 08:17.796
>> Yes.
>> And we had all these

08:17.798 --> 08:20.599
>> and we had all these
discussions, and meetings about

08:20.601 --> 08:21.500
discussions, and meetings about
this, which we've talked for

08:21.502 --> 08:23.735
this, which we've talked for
hours with the producers about

08:23.737 --> 08:25.136
hours with the producers about
what would constitute fooling

08:25.138 --> 08:25.804
what would constitute fooling
us.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.506
Us.
We've said over and over again,

08:27.508 --> 08:29.508
we've said over and over again,
if we actually saw a move, it

08:29.510 --> 08:31.109
if we actually saw a move, it
would negate the whole thing.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.645
Would negate the whole thing.
But all that having been said,

08:33.647 --> 08:35.813
but all that having been said,
and the feeling that we saw a

08:35.816 --> 08:37.616
and the feeling that we saw a
move that we should not have

08:37.618 --> 08:41.285
move that we should not have
seen, we have no idea how you

08:41.288 --> 08:44.689

identical to the one that Sara
is holding in her hand.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.057
Is holding in her hand.
The only difference is, ladies

14:19.059 --> 14:20.024
the only difference is, ladies

guns are empty.

Guns are empty.
They are not loaded with

14:22.362 --> 14:24.128
they are not loaded with
staples, and therefore, are

14:24.130 --> 14:25.396
staples, and therefore, are
completely safe.

Completely safe.
I want you to take the guns out

Can have a hero tag.
You could have spotted that

19:49.455 --> 19:51.422
you could have spotted that
stapler, moved it to the left,

19:51.424 --> 19:53.457
stapler, moved it to the left,
had her use her left hand,

19:53.459 --> 19:55.893
had her use her left hand,
gambled that she was gonna reach

19:55.895 --> 19:57.328
gambled that she was gonna reach
for that, and then done another

19:57.330 --> 19:58.596
for that, and then done another
out adjusting, and if she

19:58.598 --> 20:00.865
out adjusting, and if she
didn't, but you got lucky,

20:00.867 --> 20:01.899
didn't, but you got lucky,
because that could be the way

20:01.901 --> 20:03.534
because that could be the way
she was most likely to reach it.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.735
She was most likely to reach it.
However, that's not the way you

20:04.737 --> 20:06.404
however, that's not the way you
did it.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.940
Did it.
The smart guy has it so that

20:08.942 --> 20:12.243
the smart guy has it so that
when that thing spins, none of

20:12.245 --> 20:15.446
when that thing spins, none of
those staplers will fire, in

20:15.448 --> 20:17.381
those staplers will fire, in
which case, you need to have

20:17.383 --> 20:19.483
which case, you need to have
some way to have that be a

20:19.485 --> 20:20.451
some way to have that be a
prover.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.519
Prover.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.721
pulling out the staples at the
end, you could have all of them

20:23.723 --> 20:25.356
end, you could have all of them
with that, and it wouldn't

20:25.358 --> 20:26.624
with that, and it wouldn't
change the firing, so the

20:26.626 --> 20:28.960
change the firing, so the
question is: How do you get the

20:28.962 --> 20:31.462
question is: How do you get the
card to staple onto the board?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.564
Card to staple onto the board?
And we believe that the card

20:33.566 --> 20:35.666
and we believe that the card
that you stapled on afterward

20:35.668 --> 20:37.835
that you stapled on afterward
was actually not stapled, but

20:37.837 --> 20:39.003
was actually not stapled, but
stuck to the board with an

20:39.005 --> 20:40.605
stuck to the board with an
adhesive, or in some sort of

20:40.607 --> 20:42.473
adhesive, or in some sort of
other way, and on top of

20:42.475 --> 20:44.575
other way, and on top of
that, your accent is phony!

20:44.577 --> 20:45.810
That, your accent is phony!
[Laughter]

20:45.812 --> 20:46.911
[Laughter]
Your accent is phony.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.579
Your accent is phony.
You did not even fool us with

20:48.581 --> 20:50.514
you did not even fool us with
your accent!

20:50.516 --> 20:51.382
Your accent!
>> Oh, you're good.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.583
>> Oh, you're good.
They--they--they--

20:52.585 --> 20:53.517
they--they--they--
I would say they nailed it, but

20:53.519 --> 20:54.652
I would say they nailed it, but
they stapled you right to the

20:54.654 --> 20:56.287
they stapled you right to the
wood on that, didn't they?

20:56.289 --> 20:57.388
Wood on that, didn't they?
>> They did, yes.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.623
>> They did, yes.
Uh, yeah, I'm actually from

20:58.625 --> 20:59.490
uh, yeah, I'm actually from
margate.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.524

My name's Gary.

21:00.526 --> 21:04.462
My name's Gary.
[Laughter]

21:04.464 --> 21:05.429
[Laughter]
>> You know what, you didn't

21:05.431 --> 21:05.896
>> you know what, you didn't
fool penn or teller.

21:05.898 --> 21:06.714
Fool penn or teller.
You didn't fool them with the

21:06.715 --> 21:07.531
you didn't fool them with the
accent either.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.899
Accent either.
You fooled me with the accent

21:08.901 --> 21:10.568
you fooled me with the accent
initially, and the act.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.435
Initially, and the act.
I think he fooled everyone.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.503
I think he fooled everyone.

21:54.013 --> 21:54.912
performances for her majesty,
the queen.

21:54.914 --> 21:55.980
The queen.
The queen just looked to me at

21:55.982 --> 21:57.748
the queen just looked to me at
one point, and just said,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.918
one point, and just said,
"it's impossible."

22:00.920 --> 22:02.553
"It's impossible."
I develop my ideas, and then

22:02.555 --> 22:04.388
I develop my ideas, and then
take them to my director Tony.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.089

important for any performer,

As far as we know, nobody has

22:18.805 --> 22:19.937
as far as we know, nobody has
ever done it before in the

22:19.939 --> 22:20.971
ever done it before in the
world.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.773
World.
I strongly believe that deep

I strongly believe that deep
down, every magician loves to be

22:24.711 --> 22:26.577
down, every magician loves to be
fooled, and I'm sure it's the

22:26.579 --> 22:30.881
fooled, and I'm sure it's the
same with penn and teller.

Same with penn and teller.

And where on earth I'm going.
I need a cost for a flight

24:34.173 --> 24:36.874

that each and every one of you
has a different destination.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.591
Has a different destination.
Studio audience, would you

studio audience, would you
please hold up your number

24:54.894 --> 24:56.794

different destination, every
single one of you?

25:01.801 --> 25:02.867
Single one of you?
So would my volunteer at the

25:02.869 --> 25:05.169
so would my volunteer at the
board take out your number card,

25:05.171 --> 25:06.837
board take out your number card,
and look at the destination on

25:06.839 --> 25:08.005
and look at the destination on
the back, and write it up

25:08.007 --> 25:11.842
the back, and write it up
clearly on the board?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.544
Clearly on the board?
Let me explain something really

25:13.546 --> 25:14.078
let me explain something really
bizarre.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.746
Bizarre.
Tonight, under my jacket, I'm

25:15.748 --> 25:16.981
tonight, under my jacket, I'm
wearing a t-shirt.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.516
Wearing a t-shirt.
On the t-shirt is printed one

25:18.518 --> 25:20.885
on the t-shirt is printed one
word, and one word only.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.219
Word, and one word only.
Now, bearing in mind that I

25:22.221 --> 25:24.121
now, bearing in mind that I
can't see anything that's going

25:24.123 --> 25:25.856
can't see anything that's going
on in the studio tonight, if I

25:25.858 --> 25:28.626
on in the studio tonight, if I
could guess the continent of the

25:28.628 --> 25:29.793
could guess the continent of the
destination, then that would be

25:29.795 --> 25:30.928
destination, then that would be
pretty good.

25:30.930 --> 25:31.996
Pretty good.
You'd give me some credit.

25:31.998 --> 25:32.663
You'd give me some credit.
>> Sure.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.565
>> Sure.
>> If I could guess exactly,

25:34.567 --> 25:36.300
>> if I could guess exactly,
then that would be marvelous,

25:36.302 --> 25:37.835
then that would be marvelous,
but if the one word on my

25:37.837 --> 25:39.670
but if the one word on my
t-shirt matched the chosen

25:39.672 --> 25:41.572
t-shirt matched the chosen
destination precisely, well,

25:41.574 --> 25:43.173
destination precisely, well,
then, we'd raise the roof,

25:43.175 --> 25:46.944
then, we'd raise the roof,
because tonight, I had a funny

25:46.946 --> 25:48.045
because tonight, I had a funny
feeling that you would send me

25:48.047 --> 25:51.315
feeling that you would send me
to...Malaysia.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.651
To...Malaysia.
[Cheers and applause]

26:02.761 --> 26:06.964
Okay, so now we've got to
determine how much my trip to

26:06.966 --> 26:09.667
determine how much my trip to
Malaysia is gonna cost.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.135
Malaysia is gonna cost.
Tony, has my volunteer finished

26:11.137 --> 26:12.136
Tony, has my volunteer finished
making all the decisions with

26:12.138 --> 26:13.571
making all the decisions with
the brochures?

26:13.573 --> 26:14.905

You impressed me with that.
That's quite...

28:44.023 --> 28:47.291
That's quite...
Certainly unexpected.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.392
Certainly unexpected.
I thought Leroy was getting

28:48.394 --> 28:49.893
I thought Leroy was getting
nervous, because I saw sweat up

28:49.895 --> 28:51.829
nervous, because I saw sweat up
here on the back of his head, so

28:51.831 --> 28:52.730
here on the back of his head, so
I don't know how he did that.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.198
I don't know how he did that.
That's most--

28:54.200 --> 28:55.716
that's most--
well, I'm talking about Leroy as

28:55.717 --> 28:57.233
well, I'm talking about Leroy as
if he's a different person,

28:57.236 --> 28:58.302
if he's a different person,
which is a horrible thought.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.269
Which is a horrible thought.
>> Split personality.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.270
>> Split personality.

Sweating, it's really hot.
>> Sweating heavily.

29:04.977 --> 29:05.960
>> Sweating heavily.
So much sweat it was coming

29:05.961 --> 29:06.944
so much sweat it was coming
through the rubber mask.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.112
Through the rubber mask.
[Laughter]

29:08.114 --> 29:08.946

Can I just ask--

29:08.948 --> 29:09.680

do you ever wear that getup

29:09.681 --> 29:10.413
do you ever wear that getup
just to give your partner a

29:10.416 --> 29:12.449

Creep at home?
Okay, gentlemen, I think we've

29:13.319 --> 29:14.184
okay, gentlemen, I think we've
had enough time.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.319

we've given you plenty of space
to deliberate.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.154
To deliberate.
What do you think?

29:17.156 --> 29:17.921
What do you think?
>> I don't think there's

29:17.923 --> 29:20.924
>> I don't think there's
anything more powerful in magic

29:20.926 --> 29:22.426
anything more powerful in magic
than a human being turning into

29:22.428 --> 29:23.360

another human being.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.094
Another human being.

<i>mission impossible,</i> and they do
that peelin' the face off thing,

29:28.434 --> 29:31.001
that peelin' the face off thing,
that is done with huge amounts

29:31.003 --> 29:33.370
that is done with huge amounts
of movie magic, and to see that

29:33.372 --> 29:35.405

done live is astonishing.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.207
Done live is astonishing.
Is there anybody in the room

29:37.209 --> 29:38.776

that said it was Chris when
Leroy walked onstage?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.479
Leroy walked onstage?
Unfortunately, one of the people

29:42.481 --> 29:44.214
unfortunately, one of the people
who said that, and said it

29:44.216 --> 29:47.451
who said that, and said it
aloud to me, was teller when you

29:47.453 --> 29:50.454
aloud to me, was teller when you
walked onto the stage.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.357
Walked onto the stage.
Once you knew that, whatever you

29:53.359 --> 29:55.459
once you knew that, whatever you
wrote on there was not that hard

29:55.461 --> 29:58.162
wrote on there was not that hard
to do, because all you had to do

29:58.164 --> 30:00.864
to do, because all you had to do
was have Malaysia on your card,

30:00.866 --> 30:01.899
was have Malaysia on your card,
and that was done.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.200
And that was done.

This question here.
What we are figuring is that

actually under any of these
seats, except for the 408 which

30:14.446 --> 30:17.447
seats, except for the 408 which
you had, so if someone has the

30:17.449 --> 30:21.585
you had, so if someone has the
number 177, or the 181, we do

30:21.587 --> 30:24.321
number 177, or the 181, we do
not know how you got yourself

onstage.

Again, please?

say you kind of nailed it.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.473

together for over 35 years, but

37:17.803 --> 37:19.002
together for over 35 years, but
they've never stopped inventing

37:19.004 --> 37:21.271

>> As Jonathan--as Jonathan
said, this is a brand-new trick

37:42.995 --> 37:43.660
said, this is a brand-new trick
for us.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.894
For us.
We've never done it over here.

37:44.896 --> 37:45.629
We've never done it over here.
We've also never done it

37:45.631 --> 37:47.564
we've also never done it
anywhere on television.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.332
Anywhere on television.
It's an escape trick, and we

37:49.334 --> 37:51.635
it's an escape trick, and we
haven't done an escape act in

37:51.637 --> 37:52.502
haven't done an escape act in
years.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.704
Years.
It's also a stupid trick.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.006
It's also a stupid trick.
It's really stupid, but there's

37:56.008 --> 37:58.775
it's really stupid, but there's
one moment in it that's kind of

37:58.777 --> 38:01.344
one moment in it that's kind of
boss, and we do the whole trick

38:01.346 --> 38:04.381
boss, and we do the whole trick
just for that one moment, and

38:04.383 --> 38:07.517
just for that one moment, and
I'm gonna pick somebody from the

38:07.519 --> 38:09.286
I'm gonna pick somebody from the
audience here.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.354
Audience here.
Let's see who we got.

38:11.356 --> 38:12.389
Let's see who we got.
How about you, sir, with the

38:12.391 --> 38:12.856
how about you, sir, with the
tats?

38:12.858 --> 38:13.523
Tats?
Yeah, right up here.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.424
Yeah, right up here.
What's your name, please?

38:14.426 --> 38:14.891
What's your name, please?

please, Steve?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.496
Please, Steve?
Just walk up here onstage.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.363
Just walk up here onstage.
Now, when you're brought

38:20.365 --> 38:23.300
now, when you're brought
onstage for an escape act, it

38:23.302 --> 38:25.001
onstage for an escape act, it
often turns into this kind of

38:25.003 --> 38:27.304
often turns into this kind of
macho competition thing, because

38:27.306 --> 38:28.071
macho competition thing, because
usually when you're brought

38:28.073 --> 38:29.806
usually when you're brought
onstage for an escape act,

38:29.808 --> 38:30.840
onstage for an escape act,
you're essentially, Steve,

38:30.842 --> 38:32.575
you're essentially, Steve,
you're, like--you're, like,

38:32.577 --> 38:33.877
you're, like--you're, like,
tying a guy up, you know?

38:33.879 --> 38:35.078
Tying a guy up, you know?
Like, put rope on him, or a

38:35.080 --> 38:37.514
like, put rope on him, or a
straight jacket, or handcuffs,

38:37.516 --> 38:39.482
straight jacket, or handcuffs,
or leg irons, and there's

38:39.484 --> 38:40.884
or leg irons, and there's
telephone booths, and niagara

38:40.886 --> 38:42.352
telephone booths, and niagara
falls, and helicopters.

38:42.354 --> 38:42.969
Falls, and helicopters.
We're not doing any of that,

38:42.970 --> 38:43.585
we're not doing any of that,
Steve.

38:43.588 --> 38:44.587
Steve.
What teller's gonna do, is he's

38:44.589 --> 38:47.490
what teller's gonna do, is he's
gonna escape from this trash

38:47.492 --> 38:48.425
gonna escape from this trash
bag.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.592
Bag.
[Laughter]

38:49.594 --> 38:50.627
[Laughter]
That's the whole trick, an

38:50.629 --> 38:51.628
that's the whole trick, an
escape from a trash bag,

38:51.630 --> 38:52.896
escape from a trash bag,
something any of you can do, and

38:52.898 --> 38:55.665
something any of you can do, and
we're also gonna fill the bag

38:55.667 --> 38:58.468
we're also gonna fill the bag
with helium, which makes the

38:58.470 --> 39:01.538
with helium, which makes the
trick even stupider, 'cause

39:01.540 --> 39:04.441
trick even stupider, 'cause
helium is a deadly gas.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.376
Helium is a deadly gas.
It displaces oxygen.

39:06.378 --> 39:07.877
It displaces oxygen.
The amount of time you can stay

39:07.879 --> 39:09.579
the amount of time you can stay
in a helium environment is only

39:09.581 --> 39:10.513
in a helium environment is only
the amount of time you can hold

39:10.515 --> 39:11.481
the amount of time you can hold
your breath.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.683
Your breath.
It's a deadly gas, but it's also

39:13.685 --> 39:15.785
it's a deadly gas, but it's also
a fun and happy gas.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.653
A fun and happy gas.
[Laughter]

39:16.655 --> 39:17.821
[Laughter]
When you think about helium, you

39:17.823 --> 39:18.722
when you think about helium, you
don't think about it being

39:18.724 --> 39:19.589
don't think about it being
deadly.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.590
Deadly.
You think about it blowing up

39:20.592 --> 39:22.625
you think about it blowing up
balloons for children's birthday

39:22.627 --> 39:24.627
balloons for children's birthday
parties, so it's really stupid

39:24.629 --> 39:26.930
parties, so it's really stupid
to do a dangerous trick that

39:26.932 --> 39:28.531
to do a dangerous trick that
looks happy and fun.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.433
Looks happy and fun.
We're gonna fill this bag with

39:30.435 --> 39:32.469
we're gonna fill this bag with
helium, and teller will escape

39:32.471 --> 39:34.804
helium, and teller will escape
from the trash bag without

39:34.806 --> 39:35.839
from the trash bag without
letting the helium out.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.440
Letting the helium out.
Steve, just cinch this shut,

39:37.442 --> 39:38.074
Steve, just cinch this shut,
would you please?

39:38.076 --> 39:39.059
Would you please?
When you get it shut, just let

39:39.060 --> 39:40.043
when you get it shut, just let
go for a second.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.111
Go for a second.
I'm just gonna give this a tie,

39:41.113 --> 39:42.445
I'm just gonna give this a tie,
and then, if you would please,

39:42.447 --> 39:43.913
and then, if you would please,
Steve, bring your hand in here.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.548
Steve, bring your hand in here.
Yeah, right in here, left hand,

39:45.550 --> 39:46.516
yeah, right in here, left hand,
right up close so the gas

39:46.518 --> 39:47.917
right up close so the gas
doesn't get out very much, and

39:47.919 --> 39:48.852
doesn't get out very much, and
then, you'll also be very

39:48.854 --> 39:50.787
then, you'll also be very
careful of your rings and your

39:50.789 --> 39:51.988
careful of your rings and your
watch, because you don't want to

39:51.990 --> 39:53.623
watch, because you don't want to
puncture the bag, or you'll ruin

39:53.625 --> 39:54.491
puncture the bag, or you'll ruin
the whole trick.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.492
The whole trick.
We're gonna start filling this

39:55.494 --> 39:55.959
we're gonna start filling this
up.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.894
Up.
Now, any of you could get out of

39:57.896 --> 39:59.996
now, any of you could get out of
this trash bag, and that's

39:59.998 --> 40:01.281
this trash bag, and that's
another thing that makes it

40:01.282 --> 40:02.565
another thing that makes it
stupid, but filling it up--got

40:02.567 --> 40:04.100
stupid, but filling it up--got
to be real careful of that watch

40:04.102 --> 40:05.135
to be real careful of that watch
there, Steve.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.404
There, Steve.
Filling it up here.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.038
Filling it up here.
I just want to check--I want to

40:09.040 --> 40:10.540
I just want to check--I want to
check on teller, make sure he's

40:10.542 --> 40:11.741
check on teller, make sure he's
doing okay in there.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.042
Doing okay in there.
You okay in there, teller?

40:13.044 --> 40:14.644
You okay in there, teller?
>> Yes, I am, penn.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.079
>> Yes, I am, penn.
[Laughter]

40:16.081 --> 40:16.880
[Laughter]
>> It's rare teller speaks

40:16.882 --> 40:17.714
>> it's rare teller speaks
onstage.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.583
Onstage.
Fill this up a little more.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.552
Fill this up a little more.
There you go, Steve.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.153
There you go, Steve.
Now, just keep holding.

40:23.155 --> 40:24.120
Now, just keep holding.
I know you're bending over.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.156
I know you're bending over.
Try not to hit it with your

40:26.158 --> 40:28.091
try not to hit it with your
watch there, and then, let go

40:28.093 --> 40:29.025
watch there, and then, let go
for a second.

40:29.027 --> 40:29.843
For a second.
Let me just gonna get another

40:29.844 --> 40:30.660
let me just gonna get another
tie in.

40:30.662 --> 40:31.417
Tie in.
Now, you're gonna hold it a

40:31.418 --> 40:32.173
now, you're gonna hold it a
little bit differently.

40:32.174 --> 40:32.929
Little bit differently.
Take your left hand, hold it

40:32.931 --> 40:34.464
take your left hand, hold it
near the end, don't let go.

40:34.466 --> 40:34.931
Near the end, don't let go.
Hold that tight.

40:34.933 --> 40:35.765
Hold that tight.
Keep it right there.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.633
Keep it right there.
Don't let go.

40:36.635 --> 40:37.867
Don't let go.
Like I said, it's a really

40:37.869 --> 40:39.536
like I said, it's a really
stupid trick, but there's one

40:39.538 --> 40:42.605
stupid trick, but there's one
moment in it that's really boss.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.540
Moment in it that's really boss.
We do it for just this one

40:43.542 --> 40:44.207
we do it for just this one
moment.

40:44.209 --> 40:49.179
Moment.
One, two, three...And that's the

40:49.181 --> 40:51.047
one, two, three...And that's the
moment right there, when the

40:51.049 --> 40:52.749
moment right there, when the
audience sees that you're out of

40:52.751 --> 40:55.885
audience sees that you're out of
the bag and the helium is still

40:55.887 --> 40:57.454
the bag and the helium is still
in it.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.488
In it.

Brand-new trick.
