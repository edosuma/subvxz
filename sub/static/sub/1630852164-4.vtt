Thank you so much. Thank you.

07:36.994 --> 07:38.778
Oh, here's the thing,

07:38.822 --> 07:41.085
the first order of business,

07:41.128 --> 07:44.436
and perhaps the most
important thing, is payment.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.178
Now, did everyone have a chance
to get cash or cashier's check?

07:47.221 --> 07:49.006
Okay, good. Great.

07:49.049 --> 07:50.573
Great, wonderful.
Okay, well, let's get started.

07:50.616 --> 07:51.965
-[pen clicks]
-Chain saw,

07:52.009 --> 07:54.794
avocado, marlin.
What'd I just say? You.

07:54.838 --> 07:58.581
Um... chain saw,
avocado, marlin?

07:58.624 --> 08:00.104
Right!

08:00.147 --> 08:01.540
Which is wrong.

08:01.584 --> 08:05.239
You just violated
the first rule of acting.

08:05.283 --> 08:06.458
You listened.

08:06.502 --> 08:07.894
When you are listening,

08:07.938 --> 08:09.417
you are not talking,

08:09.461 --> 08:11.245
and if you're not talking,
you're not getting paid.

08:11.289 --> 08:14.074
You know who doesn't talk
throughout an entire movie?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.336
An extra.

08:15.380 --> 08:18.035
Which brings me
to rule number two,

08:18.078 --> 08:20.080
acting is...

08:20.124 --> 08:21.908
Oh, um, reacting.

08:21.952 --> 08:25.085
Wrong again. Acting is ignoring.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.478
Think about it.

08:26.522 --> 08:27.914
Ignore reality.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.090
You're in a casting office,
not Jurassic Park.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.788
Ignore your scene partner

08:31.831 --> 08:33.964
because you better goddamn
believe they're ignoring you.

08:34.007 --> 08:37.010
And, for Christ's sake,
ignore the script, okay?

08:37.054 --> 08:39.186
[chuckles] You're better
than a writer, right?

08:39.230 --> 08:40.231
Writers are dorks, okay?

08:40.274 --> 08:42.842
Any questions?

08:42.886 --> 08:45.149
No! Put your hands down!

08:45.192 --> 08:46.629
No.

08:46.672 --> 08:47.934
Don't ask questions.

08:47.978 --> 08:49.370
That shows
you don't know something,

08:49.414 --> 08:50.546
which makes you look weak.

08:50.589 --> 08:52.548
Got it?

08:52.591 --> 08:54.941
Now, if we could circle back
on the payment thing again,

08:54.985 --> 08:57.074
it's pretty important
to me, okay?

08:57.117 --> 08:58.597
'Cause I'm-I'm dead serious,

08:58.641 --> 09:02.383
you're not walking out of here
without the payment.

09:02.427 --> 09:03.602
Oh, my God, Charlie,

09:03.646 --> 09:05.561
we're not going to Scranton.

09:05.604 --> 09:07.563
All right, fine. What about
Harrisburg? Williamsport?

09:07.606 --> 09:08.738
Altoona? You know...

09:08.781 --> 09:10.435
Okay, will you at least consider

09:10.478 --> 09:12.132
going someplace
outside of Pennsylvania?

09:12.176 --> 09:15.222
All those cities
are in Pennsylvania?

09:15.266 --> 09:16.659
Are you kidding me?
Like, you don't want to know--

09:16.702 --> 09:17.964
thank you, monkey--
you don't want to know, like,

09:18.008 --> 09:19.618
how this shit works, man?

09:19.662 --> 09:22.795
No. I don't want to find out
how zoning districts work.

09:22.839 --> 09:24.841
I don't care about that.
Thank you, monkey.

09:24.884 --> 09:26.407
I want to go somewhere exotic.

09:26.451 --> 09:27.670
Baltimore?

09:27.713 --> 09:29.628
-Baltimore is not exotic, Frank.
-DENNIS: No.

09:29.672 --> 09:32.283
I'll tell you, I've seen shit
happen in Baltimore

09:32.326 --> 09:34.241
-that would blow your mind.
Thank you, monkey.
-Wow.

09:34.285 --> 09:35.939
You know what, guys?
I'll tell you what.

09:35.982 --> 09:36.896
Regardless of where
we decide to go,

09:36.940 --> 09:38.463
we're taking this goddamn monkey

09:38.506 --> 09:40.204
-because I love this guy.
I love him.
-Oh, yeah.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.162
It would be great
if we could hire more monkeys

09:42.206 --> 09:44.164
to do our job for us
while we're gone.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.471
Like, a team of monkeys who run
the bar, you know what I mean?

09:46.514 --> 09:49.082
-Mm.
-Oh, yeah, 'cause they're all
out of work now, you know?

09:49.126 --> 09:51.041
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-Yeah, because Hollywood decided

09:51.084 --> 09:53.652
you can't beat 'em no more, so
they had to set 'em all free.

09:53.696 --> 09:55.132
-What?
-Are you seriously?
-You can't beat monkeys?

09:55.175 --> 09:56.307
-No, you can't.
-At all?

09:56.350 --> 09:57.874
Those monkeys don't even
have jobs anymore

09:57.917 --> 09:59.049
-'cause of these snowflakes?
-Not allowed to do it no more.

09:59.092 --> 10:00.877
-These Hollywood...
-Oh, my God.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.052
I do have to admit, though,

10:02.095 --> 10:04.532
it-it is a little
disappointing to, um,

10:04.576 --> 10:07.710
discover that a team of primates
could do our jobs for us, but...

10:07.753 --> 10:09.320
[stammers]
I'm gonna blow past it

10:09.363 --> 10:10.626
because I really do
want to come up

10:10.669 --> 10:11.931
with a vacation spot
for us, you know?

10:11.975 --> 10:13.846
So, here's what
I'm thinking, guys.

10:13.890 --> 10:15.631
E-Everybody grab a napkin
there, okay?

10:15.674 --> 10:16.457
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Grab a napkin.

10:16.501 --> 10:18.416
And, uh, everybody

10:18.459 --> 10:21.288
write down a destination
on the napkin,

10:21.332 --> 10:22.899
and then we'll put
that destination

10:22.942 --> 10:25.075
in this bowl right here,

10:25.118 --> 10:26.729
I'll pick one out,

10:26.772 --> 10:28.600
-and that way
not one of us decides...
-Oh.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.689
...but we let fate take over.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.473
-What do you guys think
about that plan?
-Okay.

10:32.517 --> 10:34.040
KIKI:
I didn't say that

10:34.084 --> 10:36.173
-I don't love you.
-Then what is it?

10:36.216 --> 10:37.827
Is it my gang ties?
Because I don't need that shit.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.132
I'll leave it all behind.

10:39.176 --> 10:41.352
-Just tell me what's wrong.
-[mouthing along]

10:41.395 --> 10:42.570
KIKI:
The baby...

10:42.614 --> 10:45.182
It's not yours. It's my...

10:45.225 --> 10:47.184
my...

10:47.227 --> 10:49.273
-my father's.
-Bigger.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.188
-[inhales] My father's!
-N-- louder.

10:51.231 --> 10:54.147
-[yelling]: My father's!
-Yes!

10:54.191 --> 10:55.366
Good. Now you go.

10:56.802 --> 10:59.152
-Your father's?!
-Louder.

10:59.196 --> 11:01.677
[yelling]: Your father's?!

11:01.720 --> 11:04.810
Okay! Now, this is what
I'm talking about.

11:04.854 --> 11:06.682
Nice work. [applauds]
Do you all see that?

11:06.725 --> 11:08.771
Goddamn, that's what I want.
I want to be able

11:08.814 --> 11:10.642
to see your performance
from the fucking moon.

11:10.686 --> 11:12.818
Guys, the louder you are,

11:12.862 --> 11:15.342
the more people have
to pay attention to you.

11:15.386 --> 11:18.258
Yeah... [sighs] Yeah,
I-I don't understand the script.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.564
What movie did you say
this was from?

11:19.607 --> 11:21.827
I-I didn't. I wrote it.

11:21.871 --> 11:23.960
It's a mash-up of Chinatown

11:24.003 --> 11:26.179
and Tupac Shakur's
Poetic Justice.

11:26.223 --> 11:28.616
Oh. Are you, are you gonna
write all the scenes?

11:28.660 --> 11:31.750
Well, there you go asking a
bunch of questions again, Tony.

11:31.794 --> 11:33.012
[laughs] Uh, Kiki,

11:33.056 --> 11:34.797
how does that
make him seem to you?

11:34.840 --> 11:37.234
Um... weak?

11:37.277 --> 11:39.062
Weak! Good. Very good.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.846
Now, you, Kiki,
you're really getting this.

11:40.890 --> 11:42.282
But did you feel that?

11:42.326 --> 11:43.980
Did you feel how he went
from, like, a hot stud

11:44.023 --> 11:46.199
you'd like to bang
to a weak little bitch

11:46.243 --> 11:48.027
right before your eyes? Right?

11:48.071 --> 11:49.899
I mean, that doesn't mean
I still wouldn't do him,

11:49.942 --> 11:51.465
but that's between him and me.

11:51.509 --> 11:53.076
Tony, see me after class.

11:53.119 --> 11:55.774
Um... Okay.

11:55.818 --> 11:58.603
Wrong! Wrong! Okay.

11:58.646 --> 12:00.997
People in power
will try and bang you.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.435
Now, sometimes it will be
necessary to get the part,

12:04.478 --> 12:06.524
but assess the situation.

12:06.567 --> 12:08.569
Why go all the way when
a simple hand job will suffice?

12:10.136 --> 12:12.878
Tony, do see me after class.

12:12.922 --> 12:14.619
DENNIS:
And the place

12:14.662 --> 12:16.447
that we're going to is...

12:18.579 --> 12:20.973
[sighs] "Yell"... "Yellow"?

12:21.017 --> 12:23.193
What is, what is this?
Who, who wrote this?

12:23.236 --> 12:26.370
Uh... [stammers] Me. Yeah.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.676
W-Were you trying to
s-say Yellowstone or...?

12:28.720 --> 12:31.636
Uh... no. Uh, just yellow.

12:31.679 --> 12:33.072
-Just yellow?
Just the color yellow?
-Uh, well, I panicked.

12:33.116 --> 12:34.421
You know, you were shooting down
all the other places

12:34.465 --> 12:35.988
I've been naming, so I-I
couldn't think of something.

12:36.032 --> 12:38.121
Okay, well, that's not
a goddamn place, you idiot, so..

12:38.164 --> 12:39.600
[groans]
We're gonna try this again.

12:39.644 --> 12:41.515
Next place I pick out,
that's where we're gonna go.

12:41.559 --> 12:43.387
Mm-hmm.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.780
-"Purple."
-Mm.

12:44.823 --> 12:46.216
What is happening?

12:46.259 --> 12:48.305
[burps] That was me.
Yeah, I did purple.

12:48.348 --> 12:49.567
-You did purple?
Two of you wrote colors?
-Yeah, I...

12:49.610 --> 12:51.047
Okay, so you thought
of a color, too?

12:51.090 --> 12:52.657
I didn't understand
the assignment either.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.528
-It-it was not clear.
-I said write down
a destination,

12:54.572 --> 12:55.703
-and two people
wrote down colors?
-We're sorry, we're sorry.

12:55.747 --> 12:57.183
-I don't understand...
-I like purple.

12:57.227 --> 12:58.881
I like purple, too, Frank.
That's why I wrote it down.

12:58.924 --> 13:00.708
Well, maybe we could go there.
That could be pretty.

13:00.752 --> 13:02.972
Go where?! Purple?
That's not a place!

13:03.015 --> 13:05.148
-That-- All right, you know...
-CHARLIE: Okay, you're right.

13:05.191 --> 13:08.368
I think, um...
these beers are a little strong.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.893
-Are you drunk?
-I-- these beers
are a little strong...

13:10.936 --> 13:12.764
I will admit that the beers
are also stronger

13:12.808 --> 13:14.461
-than I was anticipating.
-I like this beer.

13:14.505 --> 13:15.549
You know what, guys?

13:15.593 --> 13:17.508
I'm having a lot of fun here.

13:17.551 --> 13:19.510
Uh, but I do want to
figure this out, so, new plan.

13:19.553 --> 13:20.946
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

13:20.990 --> 13:23.079
Instead of writing down places,

13:23.122 --> 13:26.125
why don't we write down
key words?

13:26.169 --> 13:27.648
Or phrases, you know?

13:27.692 --> 13:28.998
Let's go with our instincts,
you know?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.260
Whatever we want to feel,

13:30.303 --> 13:31.870
what-whatever
we want to experience

13:31.914 --> 13:33.350
on the vacation, okay? And then

13:33.393 --> 13:34.742
we'll put it up on a board.

13:34.786 --> 13:36.309
We'll look at it all together
and then maybe

13:36.353 --> 13:39.051
the destination will just
reveal itself to us.

13:39.095 --> 13:42.141
And... we can drink
more monkey beer.

13:42.185 --> 13:43.751
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

13:43.795 --> 13:45.928
-Monkey!
-We'll drink monkey beer
while we're doing it.

13:45.971 --> 13:48.017
-Monkey.
-Four more monkey beers, monkey.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.845
-Monkey, monkey, monkey beer!
-Monkey! Four more!

13:52.543 --> 13:54.327
Ms. Reynolds, can I talk
to you for a second?

13:54.371 --> 13:56.808
Oh, God, what's this? Listen,
if you don't have the cash,

13:56.852 --> 13:59.332
you're gonna want to borrow it
from, like, an uncle or a friend

13:59.376 --> 14:00.943
or something 'cause I don't make
exceptions. [chuckles]

14:00.986 --> 14:03.902
No. It's, uh, it's not
the money, um...

14:03.946 --> 14:06.687
I just wanted to say...
thank you.

14:06.731 --> 14:08.515
It feels

14:08.559 --> 14:10.561
so good to be seen like that.

14:10.604 --> 14:12.737
My parents don't really
believe in me, so...

14:12.780 --> 14:15.261
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Stop talking.

14:15.305 --> 14:17.960
Holy shit. [gasps]

14:18.003 --> 14:20.571
You're making me
realize something here.

14:20.614 --> 14:21.920
Maybe this doesn't
have to be a scam.

14:21.964 --> 14:22.965
What?

14:23.008 --> 14:24.183
Well, what I mean is,

14:24.227 --> 14:25.924
I-I was just able
to give you something

14:25.968 --> 14:27.186
your parents never did,

14:27.230 --> 14:29.797
and all-all I had to do
was... [chuckles]

14:29.841 --> 14:32.452
toss you a single
compliment. [gasps]

14:32.496 --> 14:34.280
I can control you.

14:34.324 --> 14:37.544
I can make you feel
however I want you to feel,

14:37.588 --> 14:39.895
which will help you
be a better actor.

14:39.938 --> 14:42.027
-Oh, I do want to be a better...
-Shh. I'm not done.

14:42.071 --> 14:45.944
[gasps] Oh, that's-that's
real power.

14:45.988 --> 14:48.773
Way more power than just acting,
and I think that's what it was

14:48.816 --> 14:50.470
probably all about
for me, you know?

14:50.514 --> 14:52.777
I just... I was searching
for a sense of control.

14:52.820 --> 14:53.865
Oh, Kiki...

14:53.909 --> 14:55.432
[laughing]:
you were...

14:55.475 --> 14:57.129
terrible.

14:57.173 --> 14:59.088
Wait, I-I was?

14:59.131 --> 15:00.959
No. No. [laughs]

15:01.003 --> 15:02.656
-[sighs]
-I'm kidding.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.703
[gasps] You were amazing.

15:05.746 --> 15:08.488
And you're going to make it.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.925
I believe in you.

15:09.968 --> 15:11.970
Oh, you do?

15:12.014 --> 15:13.885
Maybe.

15:13.929 --> 15:15.713
I'm not going
to tell you right now.

15:18.107 --> 15:19.325
But yes.

15:19.369 --> 15:21.197
[both laughing]

15:21.240 --> 15:23.634
Oh, my God! This is... [gasps]

15:23.677 --> 15:25.636
This is amazing. Yes, Kiki, yes.

15:25.679 --> 15:27.377
I'm going to be there for you.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.248
I'm going to be the mother
and father that you never had.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.859
-I'm only going to take 35%...
-[phone buzzing]

15:31.903 --> 15:32.904
...of all your future earnings,

15:32.948 --> 15:34.645
and I will never, never

15:34.688 --> 15:37.343
turn my back on you,
do you understand?

15:37.387 --> 15:39.737
-Yes.
-Because you--
Can you give me one second?

15:39.780 --> 15:41.521
-My phone is buzzing
off the hook in my pocket.
-Oh, yeah.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.349
One sec. Hello?

15:43.393 --> 15:45.090
No! I'm gonna see the director.

15:45.134 --> 15:48.006
Um, hi, yes. Uh, is this
Deandra Reynolds?

15:48.050 --> 15:50.095
-Yup.
-[over phone]: Right. Well, uh,

15:50.139 --> 15:51.923
-I'm so sorry to just call you
out of the blue like this...
-Faster.

15:51.967 --> 15:53.707
-What?
-Faster.

15:53.751 --> 15:55.927
Right. Brilliant. Um,

15:55.971 --> 15:57.798
well, I am the director
of the TV show

15:57.842 --> 15:58.886
that you crashed
the audition on the other day,

15:58.930 --> 16:01.280
and we have a role that...

16:01.324 --> 16:03.674
-Slower.
-[laughs]

16:03.717 --> 16:04.936
All right, um,

16:04.980 --> 16:07.417
well, as I was saying, I am...

16:07.460 --> 16:08.896
the... director...

16:08.940 --> 16:10.246
Too slow. Don't start over.

16:10.289 --> 16:13.379
[chuckles] Okay.
Uh, well, I saw your tape,

16:13.423 --> 16:16.904
and, based on what I saw,
and this conversation,

16:16.948 --> 16:18.863
I think we have a part
that might be right for you.

16:18.906 --> 16:19.951
Stop.

16:19.995 --> 16:22.910
Attention, everyone.

16:22.954 --> 16:25.261
Dee Reynolds Acting School
is officially closed.

16:25.304 --> 16:27.089
And I'm sorry, there will be
no return on investments,

16:27.132 --> 16:29.656
but it was in the fine print.
Have a wonderful afternoon.

-What the hell is happening?

16:43.279 --> 16:45.237
-[clears throat] Guys, wake up.
-Huh?

16:45.281 --> 16:46.238
-Wake...
-[groans]

16:46.282 --> 16:47.718
-Huh?
-Wha...

16:47.761 --> 16:49.894
Oh, my God.
My head is killing me.

16:49.937 --> 16:53.115
Oh, dude. I am very hungover.
I do not feel good.

16:53.158 --> 16:55.769
Charlie,
you're full of scratches.

16:55.813 --> 16:57.945
-So are you.
-[sighs]

16:57.989 --> 16:59.860
-Wait, I got scratches, too.
-Oh, shit. [groans]

16:59.904 --> 17:02.167
-Dude, Mac, I think you
got bit in the neck, man.
-[winces]

17:02.211 --> 17:03.777
-Is that shit on the bar?
-[groans]

17:03.821 --> 17:05.518
What-what is that...

17:05.562 --> 17:08.347
sour, salty taste in my mouth?
Do you guys have that?

17:08.391 --> 17:09.696
-Yeah, I got that.
-Yes. Yes, I have that.

17:09.740 --> 17:12.177
-What is that? [groans]
-Yeah, it's real bad.

17:12.221 --> 17:13.265
Uh-oh, guys...

17:13.309 --> 17:14.658
CHARLIE:
Oh, yeah, I feel like shit.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.094
I think we've been outsmarted.

17:16.138 --> 17:17.400
-What?
-Huh?

17:17.443 --> 17:19.271
[scoffs]
The monkey got us drunk,

17:19.315 --> 17:20.403
assaulted us,

17:20.446 --> 17:21.795
robbed the bar,

17:21.839 --> 17:23.667
and possibly fucked our mouths.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.103
[retching]

17:26.626 --> 17:28.933
-Oh, God!
-Yeah, he did.
That is what happened.

17:28.976 --> 17:30.282
Yeah, the guy who sold him to me

17:30.326 --> 17:31.892
did say something
like this could happen.

17:31.936 --> 17:33.546
He did?!

17:33.590 --> 17:35.374
Yeah. Apparently,
the monkey's grandfather

17:35.418 --> 17:37.811
was Fatty Arbuckle's monkey,

17:37.855 --> 17:38.899
and you know
how these things go.

17:38.943 --> 17:40.727
These monkeys are passed down

17:40.771 --> 17:42.773
from one Hollywood creep
to the next,

17:42.816 --> 17:44.166
until, eventually,

17:44.209 --> 17:46.298
they wind up
under a bridge in Philly

17:46.342 --> 17:48.474
getting drunk and pulling scams.

17:48.518 --> 17:51.260
-[groans] Goddamn. All right.
-What?

17:51.303 --> 17:53.088
All right, all right, we got
to think about this. All right,

17:53.131 --> 17:56.178
so let's not take the monkey
on our vacation.

17:56.221 --> 17:57.962
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:58.005 --> 17:59.442
The vacation.

17:59.485 --> 18:01.096
I think we landed on a
vacation destination last night.

18:01.139 --> 18:03.359
Yeah, we did, we did.
Look, look, look.

18:03.402 --> 18:04.838
-Oh, look at the board.
-We did?
-Yeah.

18:04.882 --> 18:06.231
We got something on here.
Let's um...

18:06.275 --> 18:08.146
Okay, should we see
where we're going?

18:08.190 --> 18:10.322
-Yeah, where are we going?
-Where we going? Where we going?

18:10.366 --> 18:12.716
All right, here we go...

18:12.759 --> 18:14.761
"Monkey beer island

18:14.805 --> 18:17.024

18:17.068 --> 18:19.114
-[sighs] Goddamn it.
-That's not a place.

18:19.157 --> 18:20.724
-That's not a place?
-No, it's not!

18:20.767 --> 18:23.161
No, it's not a goddamn place.
You know what this is?

18:23.205 --> 18:24.815
This is the ramblings
of four men

18:24.858 --> 18:26.338
who got very, very drunk last
night on a mystery concoction

18:26.382 --> 18:28.384
invented by a wild animal.

18:28.427 --> 18:30.255
[whimpers]
Why can't we just be normal?

18:30.299 --> 18:31.822
-That is what it is.
-That's so weird.

18:31.865 --> 18:33.040
Why would we do that?

18:33.084 --> 18:35.130
Because the monkey beers
were so delicious.

18:35.173 --> 18:37.219
All right? That-that-that monkey
may have been a pervert,

18:37.262 --> 18:39.960
but he was also a genius, which
is often the case in Hollywood.

18:40.004 --> 18:41.440
You know what I'm thinking?

18:41.484 --> 18:43.616
'Cause I'm seeing a lot of empty
whiskey bottles around,

18:43.660 --> 18:45.792
I'm thinking maybe that monkey
was just pouring, like,

18:45.836 --> 18:47.185
half a bottle of whiskey
in each beer.

18:47.229 --> 18:48.186
-You know?
-That could be.

18:48.230 --> 18:49.318
Based on my hangover, I think

18:49.361 --> 18:50.667
that's what I'm,
that's what I'm feeling.

18:50.710 --> 18:51.798
-[sighs] Goddamn it.
-That tracks, that tracks.

18:51.842 --> 18:53.409
So, monkey beer

18:53.452 --> 18:55.672
is just whiskey...

18:55.715 --> 18:57.804
-CHARLIE: Whiskey-beer, yeah.
-...beer?

18:57.848 --> 19:00.416

19:10.730 --> 19:12.906
Do not even care
'cause guess what, dick nips.

She comes in screaming.

-Screaming.
-Cackling like a witch.

19:44.460 --> 19:47.332

like... [sighs]

-I don't know.
-Uh, you don't know?

20:01.651 --> 20:03.130
-Right? It wasn't clear.
-Frank looked at me...

20:03.174 --> 20:04.523
Why did you guys act like
you knew what it was, then?

20:04.567 --> 20:05.959
I don't know. We were all
getting excited together.

20:06.003 --> 20:07.222
-I was excited... [stammers]
-And, yeah, uh...

20:07.265 --> 20:08.571
Goddamn it.
Frank, you tell them what it is.

20:08.614 --> 20:10.834
-Yeah, what is it?
-I don't know what it is.

uh, we don't know what it is.
