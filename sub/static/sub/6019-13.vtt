00:02.440 --> 00:04.078
I love it when people
are complimented on their clothes.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.148
And they accept the compliment
as if it was about them.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.517
Nice tie. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.391
The compliment is for the tie.
It's not for you. But we take it.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.831
And that's the job of clothes.
To get compliments for us.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.116
Because it's very hard
to get compliments...

00:22.280 --> 00:25.590
...based on your human qualities.
Right? Let's face it.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.955
No matter how nice you are,
nobody is gonna say;

00:28.120 --> 00:30.076
"Hey, nice person."

00:30.760 --> 00:34.639
It's much easier to be a bastard and
just try and match the colours up.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.833
Oh, look at this.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.356
Boy. Oh, I miss the days when
they made toys that could kill a kid.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.390
Oh, cool. Look at that.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.591
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.151
That is a Schwinn Sting-Ray.
And it's the girls' model.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.153
Oh, I always wanted one
of these when I was little.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.794
What do you think, Jerry?

01:02.920 --> 01:05.673
Jerry. What do you think?

01:05.840 --> 01:08.479
Oh, yeah, it would be great
for your paper route.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.039
I love it. I'm getting it.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.710
Can you help me get it down, Jerr?
Jerry.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.753
-Your friend needs some help.
-The only way to really help her...

01:16.920 --> 01:18.672
...is to just let her be.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.392
Hey.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.433
-A little baby girl?
-Doctor says it could be any day now.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.319
So, Carrie, you and Susan
are cousins.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.709
So your baby daughter is gonna be
Susan's second cousin, right?

01:45.880 --> 01:48.917
-So, what does that make me?
-lt doesn't make you anything.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.156
Well, so, legally, I could
marry your daughter.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.318
So have you picked out a name yet?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.670
Well, we've narrowed
it down to a few.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.068
We like Kimberly.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.715
Oh, boy.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.797
You don't like Kimberly?

02:11.320 --> 02:13.311
-What else you got?
-How about Joan?

02:13.520 --> 02:15.829
-Come on, I'm eating here.
-George.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.713
-Pamela?
-Pamela?

02:19.680 --> 02:21.033
All right. I'll tell you what.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.509
You look like nice people.
I'm gonna help you out.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.672
You want a beautiful name? Soda.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.758
-What?
-Soda.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.031
S-O-D-A. Soda.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.390
I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.594
All names sound strange
the first time you hear them.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.955
Are you telling me people
loved the name Blanche...

02:41.120 --> 02:43.315
...the first time they heard it?

02:43.520 --> 02:46.512
-Yeah, but Soda?
-Yeah, that's right.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.796
-It's working.
-We'll put it on the list.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.831
I solve problems.
That's just what I do.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.748
Yeah, let's look at that boy.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.754
That's good.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.558
You're going to town with that turkey.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.790
Oh, yeah. I got a big appetite.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.998
Oh, Jerry. You got no mustard.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.873
-It's on the door.
-What, this yellow stuff?

03:12.040 --> 03:13.871
No, I said, mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.112
I still wanna do it.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.279
No.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.394
That's bush league. No.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.071
Hey, wait. You're just gonna
leave it there?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.390
-It's half a pound of turkey.
-I can't eat that.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.312
You can't eat a sandwich
without Dijon.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.950
Yeah, you're right. I really should keep
more of your favourites on hand.

03:34.680 --> 03:38.593
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm getting a vibe here.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.231
What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

03:42.040 --> 03:43.712
What arrangement?

03:43.920 --> 03:46.718
I was under the impression that
I could take anything I wanted...

03:46.880 --> 03:48.950
...from your fridge. You take
whatever from mine.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.515
Let me know when you get
something in there, and I will.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.394
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.393
Hey. What's with your neck?

03:58.320 --> 04:01.869
It's still killing me from having
to get that bike off the wall...

04:02.040 --> 04:03.359
...by myself.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.393
Well, if it's any consolation,
I did get her number.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.636
I think I really strained it.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.916
Oh, I doubt you strained it.
Maybe you pulled it.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.672
-Maybe.
-Did you twist it?

04:12.840 --> 04:14.671
-You could have twisted it?
-I don't know.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.552
Did you wrench it?
Did you jam it?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.075
-Maybe you squeezed it and turned it?
-Why don't you...

04:19.240 --> 04:21.515
-...just shut the hell up.
-All right.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.152
God, man, this is killing me.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.995
I would give that bike to the person
who could make this pain go away.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.432
-You're really hurting, huh?
-Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.670
Well, you're arterioles
have constricted.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.438
All right, lean forward. Relax.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.716
-What? What?
-Encounter shiatsu.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.791
Wait a minute. You know
what you're doing?

04:40.960 --> 04:44.350
Oh, yeah. A wise man once
taught me the healing power...

04:44.520 --> 04:46.875
...of the body's
natural pressure points.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.071
He sells T-shirts near
the World Trade Center.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.959
He's a genius.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.599
Here we go.
Here we go.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.637
All right, from pain
will come pleasure.

04:58.440 --> 04:59.839
VoilÃ .

05:00.560 --> 05:02.312
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.268
Wow, that is unbelievable.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.635
That pain is totally gone.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.475
What's even more amazing is
his formal training is in paediatrics.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.553
All right. My work is done here.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.836
Oh, man. Kramer, thank you.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.634
-You can send that bike over any time.
-What?

05:20.160 --> 05:22.549
-What is he talking about?
-I don't know.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.109
You said you'd give the bike
to whoever fixes your neck.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.788
-You really think he wants the bike?
-Oh, yeah.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.313
But it took him like 10 seconds.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.478
Well, that's the most he's
worked in the last four months.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.239
-I think they really went for that Soda.
-What are you, crazy?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.595
They hated it.
They were just humouring you.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.876
All right. Very good.
Believe me.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.793
-That kid's going to be called Soda.
-I can tell you...

05:46.960 --> 05:48.757
...I would never name my child Soda.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.871
Oh, no, no, no.
No, of course not.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.759
I got a great name for our kids,
a real original.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.837
You wanna hear what it is?
Are you ready?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.399
Yeah.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.199
-What is that, sign language?
-No.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.591
Seven.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.950
Seven Costanza. You're serious?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.628
Yeah, it's a beautiful name
for a boy or a girl.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.951
-Especially a girl. Or a boy.
-I don't think so.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.516
-What, you don't like the name?
-It's not a name. It's a number.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.711
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.030
So not only is it
an all-around beautiful name...

06:21.200 --> 06:24.397
-...it is also a living tribute.
-It's awful. I hate it.

06:25.240 --> 06:28.038
-Well, that's the name.
-Oh, no it is not.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.755
No child of mine is ever going
to be named Seven.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.757
All right. Let's just
stay calm here.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.275
Don't get all crazy on me.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.511
Seven? Yeah, I guess
I could see it.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.319
Seven. Seven periods of school.
Seven beatings a day.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.950
Roughly seven stitches a beating,
and, eventually, seven years to life.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.758
You're doing that child
quite a service.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.359
Yes, I am.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.909
I defy you to come up
with a better name than Seven.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.559
All right. Let's see.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.790
How about Mug?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.991
Mug Costanza.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.388
That's original.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.438
-Ketchup. Pretty name for a girl.
-Right. You having a good time?

07:03.600 --> 07:06.239
I got 50 right here in the cupboard.
How about Bisquick?

07:06.640 --> 07:10.349
Pimento? Gherkin? Sauce?

07:10.520 --> 07:13.910
-Maxwell House?
-All right, already.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.838
This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.399
I had this name for a long time.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.959
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.673
That's the one you met in the store?

07:20.840 --> 07:23.479
She had this great black and white
dress with a scoop neck.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.551
She looked like some
kind of superhero.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.593
And you met her in an antique store.
I don't know how you do it.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.233
I'm not engaged.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.438
-I got it.
-Got what?

07:34.600 --> 07:37.194
I got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem is solved.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.795
Oh, it's no problem.
You can take whatever you want.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.150
I will. But now I'm accountable.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.151
All right, I take what I want. Here.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.639
And I write it down.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.950
One cupcake.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.714
And then I put it in the bowl.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.075
There. Very simple.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.876
-Sort of a mooching inventory.
-No, not mooching.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.871
Because at the end of the week
you add them.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.758
-And you give me the bill.
-All right.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.319
Look, I gotta run some errands.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.034
When Elaine comes by with that bike,
hang on to it for me.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.276
Kramer, I don't know
if you're getting that bike.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.238
Oh, yes, I am.
We had a verbal contract.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.551
If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.398
Oh, yeah, yeah, put that on my tab.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.635
Well, this is it.
The food is atrocious.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.633
But the busboys
are the best in the city.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.753
-May I take your coat, miss?
-Yes, thank you.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.195
-The same outfit?
-The exact same outfit.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.674
-How many days between encounters?
-Three.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.311
Three days. Well, maybe you caught
her on the cusp of a new wash cycle.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.955
You know, she did laundry
the day after she met you.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.156
Everything got clean.
She started all over again.

08:53.720 --> 08:58.669
Possibly. But then shouldn't the outfit
only reappear at the end of the cycle?

08:58.880 --> 09:01.075
Maybe she moved it up
in the rotation.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.396
Why? It's our first date.
She's already in reruns.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.435
-Very curious.
-lndeed.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.676
Einstein wore the exact same outfit
every day.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.713
Well, if she splits the atom,
I'll let it slide.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.994
-All right. I'm heading home.
-Did Susan change her mind...

09:18.160 --> 09:20.276
-...about the name?
-Not yet, but she's weakening.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.072
Just because your life is destroyed...

09:22.240 --> 09:24.470
...don't destroy someone else's.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.319
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry.
My idol.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.233
-How about Mickey?
-Mickey?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.598
Mickey....

09:38.280 --> 09:41.272
-ls this your half a can of soda?
-Nope, that's yours.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.317
My half is gone.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.473
-What?
-Yeah.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.114
I put my half a can here in the tab.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.159
-Why? What's your beef?
-You cannot buy half a can of soda.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.357
-Well, why not?
-I don't wanna get into the physics of it.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.909
But you know the sound
a can makes when you open it?

10:00.080 --> 10:01.354
-Yeah.
-That is the sound...

10:01.520 --> 10:03.192
...of you buying a whole can.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.750
And the same goes for this.
Okay?

10:06.920 --> 10:10.356
When you pierce the skin of a piece
of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.954
Not a third of an apple.
Not a half of a banana.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.838
-All right.
-You bite it, you bought it.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.235
All right. I'll make
the necessary adjustments.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.231
-All right.
-Thank you.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.755
Oh, so how's the neck?

10:21.960 --> 10:23.188
Nice and loose?

10:23.400 --> 10:25.595
Lookit, Kramer, you are
not getting this bike.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.911
I don't even know why you want it.
I mean, it's a girls' bike.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.991
It's a verbal contract.
We had a deal.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.428
No, we didn't.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.113
You take these things too literally.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.511
It's like saying you're hungry
enough to eat horse.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.792
Well my friend Jay Riemenschneider
eats horse all the time.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.315
He gets it from his butcher.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.913
This is not the point.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.470
The point is,
you just can't have the bike.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.870
Boy, I am really surprised at you.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.077
You are the last person I figured
would do something like this.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.670
I mean, George, yeah, I can see that.
Even Jerry.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.709
But not you, Elaine.
I always put you up here.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.189
They're over here.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.909
Now you're all;

11:12.360 --> 11:15.830
-All right.
-Yeah.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.669
Come on. It's a fantastic name.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.270
It's a real original. Nobody else is
gonna have it. And I absolutely love it.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.391
Well, I don't know how original
it's gonna be.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.355
-Why not?
-Well, I was telling Carrie...

11:30.520 --> 11:33.751
...about our argument. And when l
told them the name, they just loved it.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.991
-So, what are you saying?
-They're naming their baby Seven.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.276
What? They're stealing the name?

11:41.440 --> 11:42.668
That's my name. I made it up.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.393
I can't believe they're using it.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.158
Now, it's not gonna be original.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.833
It's gonna lose all its cachet.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.070
I don't know how much
cachet it had to begin with.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.713
Oh, it's got cachet, baby.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.553
It's got cachet up the ying-yang.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.717
Oh, God.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.788
Oh, God.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.599
Kramer.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.672
Watch your step.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.713
Oh, stupid Kramer.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.559
Excuse me, Elaine.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.278
Over here.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.317
I thought that was you.
You're Jerry's friend.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.351
Yeah. Yeah.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.239
-Christie?
-Yes, how you doing?

12:31.440 --> 12:33.078
I'm fine.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.390
Well, I gotta run.
It was good to see you.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.160
Okay. It was good to....

12:38.320 --> 12:40.117
Good to see you.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.589
-Looking good.
-Hey, Cosmo.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.228
-Nice wheels.
-You got that right.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.073
-Hey, you're riding a girls' bike.
-Kramer.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.078
Kramer.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.917
-Hello.
-Hello, Ken.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.150
It's George Costanza.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.197
I think we need to talk.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.312
Kramer.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.830
-Kramer!
-Hey.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.878
God. Is Kramer back
from his little joyride yet?

13:10.280 --> 13:13.750
-Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
-His chiropractic job was a crock.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.229
I mean, it's even worse
than it was before.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.158
I'd think Kramer
would have a knack...

13:18.320 --> 13:20.197
...for moving a person's spine
around.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.039
Hey, you know what?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.430
I think I ran into that girl
from the antique store.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.751
-What's her name, Christie?
-You saw her? What was she wearing?

13:30.400 --> 13:33.039
I don't know. I couldn't see.
I couldn't look down...

13:33.200 --> 13:35.555
-...because of my neck.
-Didn't you get a glimpse?

13:35.720 --> 13:37.438
-An impression?
-What do you care?

13:37.640 --> 13:39.835
Both times I've seen her,
she's worn the same dress.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.880
-Did you have a nice ride?
-Oh, great ride.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.918
Oh, that's good,
because it was your last.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.797
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.912
You gotta give me back that bike.
Look at this! Look!

13:57.080 --> 13:58.991
I couldn't even crawl
out of bed this morning.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.152
Bed? You should be sleeping on
a wooden board for at least a week.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.716
-What? You never told me that.
-Well, it's common sense.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.030
What is he talking about?
He's being ridiculous.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.792
Look, Jerry, you know
the whole story.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.359
-You should settle this.
-Yeah.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.272
I'm flattered you'd
appeal to my wisdom.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.670
But, unfortunately,
my friendship to each of you...

14:15.840 --> 14:17.671
...precludes my getting involved.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.149
What you need is
an impartial mediator.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.749
Yeah, I'd go for that.
Would you go for that?

14:22.920 --> 14:24.797
All right, I'm down.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.675
It would have to be someone
who hasn't heard the story.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.832
Someone who is unencumbered
by any emotional attachment.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.479
Someone whose heart is so dark...

14:32.640 --> 14:36.599
...it cannot be swayed by pity, emotion
or human compassion of any kind.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.798
So that's the situation.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.437
You present an interesting dilemma.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.476
Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.112
And yet the bicycle can have
only one rightful owner.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.396
Quite the conundrum.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.190
As a federal employee,
I believe the law is all we have.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.476
It's all that separates us
from the savages...

15:00.640 --> 15:02.551
...who don't deserve
the privilege of mail.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.029
Stuffing parcels in mailboxes,
where they don't belong.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.912
Newman!

15:10.680 --> 15:15.151
But you must promise
that you will abide by my decision...

15:15.320 --> 15:19.199
...no matter how unjust
it may seem to either of you.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.271
Do I have your word?

15:21.440 --> 15:23.271
-All right, yeah.
-Yeah.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.557
All right. Let's begin.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.638
My cocoa.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.273
Why can't we use Seven?

15:31.480 --> 15:34.756
It's my name. I made it up.
You can't just steal it.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.951
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.918
You already postponed the wedding.
Who knows if you'll get married.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.317
Hey, hey, don't worry about me.
I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.391
Look, we're both big
Mickey Mantle fans.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.278
And we love the name.
It's very unusual.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.000
What happened to Soda?
I thought we all agreed on Soda.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.509
-We don't care for Soda.
-You don't care for Soda?

15:52.720 --> 15:54.438
No, no. We don't like Soda at all.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.632
How do you not like Soda?
It's bubbly. It's refreshing.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.119
-What is it?
-I felt something.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.077
-Are you okay?
-I'm going into labour.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.038
Oh, God. Okay, let's not panic.
Let's just get to the hospital.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.555
-Okay.
-I got the suitcase packed right here.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.756
-Let's go.
-What about Six?

16:09.320 --> 16:11.515
Nine? Thirteen?
Thirteen is no good.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.796
Fourteen. Fourteen.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.349
Are you okay, Jerry?
You seem quiet.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.314
No, I'm just a little worn-out.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.751
-I know exactly what you mean.
-Oh, I'm sure you do.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.235
What in God's name
is going on here?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.595
Is she wearing the same thing
over and over again?

16:32.760 --> 16:35.228
Or does she have a closet full
of these like Superman?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.595
I've got to unlock this mystery.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.830
Oh, my God.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.678
I can't go to the movies like this.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.274
Do you mind if we go back
to my apartment so I can change?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.839
Change? Yes, I think
that's a super idea.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.478
-Are we almost there?
-Just keep breathing, okay?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.358
-Okay, okay.
-Okay.

16:58.520 --> 17:02.559
You know, the thing is, I kind
of promised the widow Mantle...

17:02.720 --> 17:04.597
...that I would name my baby Seven.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.273
Now's not the best time, George.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.829
It's just that I know her.
And, boy--

17:11.000 --> 17:12.877
George, she's in labour.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.512
So am l.

17:18.599 --> 17:23.627
Well, you both presented
very convincing arguments.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.076
On the one hand, Elaine...

17:26.240 --> 17:28.674
...your promise was given in haste.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.075
But was it not still a promise?

17:32.760 --> 17:37.038
And, Kramer, you did provide a
service in exchange for compensation.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.829
But does the fee, once paid,
not entitle the buyer...

17:41.000 --> 17:44.276
...to some assurance
of reliability?

17:46.200 --> 17:50.318
These were not easy questions
to answer.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.833
Not for any man.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.880
But I have made a decision.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.591
We will cut the bike
down the middle...

17:58.760 --> 18:00.671
...and give half to each of you.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.916
What? This is your solution?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.798
To ruin the bike?

18:04.960 --> 18:07.349
All right. Fine, fine.
Go ahead.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.398
-Cut the stupid thing in half.
-No, no, no. Give it to her.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.869
I'd rather it belong to another
than see it destroyed.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.871
Newman, give it to her.
I beg you.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.396
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Not so fast, Elaine.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.232
Only the bike's true owner...

18:20.400 --> 18:23.153
...would rather give it away
than see it come to harm.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.834
-Kramer, the bike is yours.
-What?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.037
Sweet justice.
Newman, you are wise.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.599
But this isn't fair.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.951
Lookit, my neck is still hurting me.
And now you have the bike?

18:34.160 --> 18:35.673
Well, tell it to the judge, honey.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.629
I'm going for a ride.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.034
Here we are.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.672
So this is the fortress of solitude.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.193
Well, I guess I'll go change.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.234
Yes, change. By all means, change.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.712
August 17th, 1992.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.399
The same dress.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.597
She never changes. Oh, my God.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.189
She's gotta have hundreds
of these dresses.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.193
There must be a secret stash
around here somewhere.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.794
-Are you looking for something?
-I thought you were changing.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.389
You know, maybe we should
just call it a night.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.830
No, no, no. Come on.
Put something else on.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.399
It's early. Let's go out.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.035
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.875
You know, I'm kind of tired myself.
I'll just sleep here on the couch.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.430
In the morning, we'll walk out together.
Both dressed, different clothes.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.868
I'll be in the same clothes.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.190
You'll be in different clothes,
as it's your place.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.033
We'll go down. Me in my same
clothes, you in different clothes.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.117
Jerry, I don't think so.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.592
-Wanna throw something on,
walk me...

19:52.800 --> 19:54.119
-...to a cab?
-Get out.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.477
Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow.
I'll help you lay it out on the bed.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.992
-Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
-You're really being very selfish.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.475
Be nice if you'd think
of someone other than yourself.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.835
-I'm having a baby.
-You're not getting Seven.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.116
-Now, get out of here.
-Please, I have so little.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.430
-I'm sorry, sir. Family only.
-I'm family.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.397
I'm having sex with the cousin.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.473
Seven! Seven!

20:19.800 --> 20:23.076
Hello, Christie. I was wondering
if we could get together again.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.873
Oh, really?

20:25.040 --> 20:26.996
You can't break up
with me over the phone.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.839
You gotta do this in person.
It doesn't have to be one-on-one.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.991
Bring a group of friends.
I just wanna see you.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.516
Don't hang up on me. Why do you
always wear the same dress? Hello?

20:37.320 --> 20:39.390
Jerry, if you're gonna be
snacking on these...

20:39.560 --> 20:41.630
...you can't expect me to pay
for the whole box.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.236
All right, Hobo Joe.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.430
I didn't wanna put a damper
on your smorgasbord.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.672
But it's the end of the week,
so I added up your tab.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.032
I know, pretty steep.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.872
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.072
-Few do.
-I'm good for it.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.397
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid,
the food court is closed.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.154
Closed? All right.

21:05.320 --> 21:09.108
I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And don't eat any more.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.988
Hey, that's my bike.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.191
-Gangway.
-This is my bike.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.073
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I bought it from Kramer.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.033
He was hard up for cash.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.714
Fifty bucks. Can you believe it?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.152
I had to make some
minor modifications.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.511
Solid tires, reinforced seat post...

21:30.720 --> 21:33.951
...heavy-duty shocks.
But, baby, this is one sweet ride.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.879
No, you gotta give me back that bike.
Newman, give it.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.356
Elaine, Elaine.
Help me. Help me.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.590
Help. Help. Help.
