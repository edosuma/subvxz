[water gushing]

01:16.291 --> 01:18.291
[Lemony]  If you are considering
a career in villainy,

01:18.375 --> 01:20.041
you will need several things...

01:20.541 --> 01:22.333
-A villainous laugh...
-[laughter]

01:22.416 --> 01:26.541
...a villainous way to get around,
like a particularly nightmarish submarine,

01:26.958 --> 01:28.416
and most important of all,

01:28.500 --> 01:31.583
a villainous disregard
for the lives of other people.

01:31.666 --> 01:34.666
You orphans are as useless at sea
as you are on land.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.958
I order you to bring my girlfriend
a sugar bowl,

01:37.041 --> 01:39.291
and instead,
all you bring is a coughing baby!

01:39.875 --> 01:42.958
If you are a mycologist,
or if you have seen the previous episode,

01:43.041 --> 01:45.958
then you know several facts
about the Medusoid Mycelium.

01:46.041 --> 01:47.458
[Olaf] The brig is this way!

01:47.791 --> 01:50.750
You know that it is a poisonous fungus
that waxes and wanes,

01:50.833 --> 01:53.750
a phrase which here means
it disappears and reappears.

01:53.833 --> 01:55.458
What the No, this way.

01:55.791 --> 01:58.250
You know that it grows best
in small, dark places,

01:58.333 --> 01:59.958
like the throat of a toddler,

02:00.041 --> 02:02.666
and you know that it works
on a very strict schedule,

02:03.041 --> 02:06.375
a schedule that currently meant
Sunny Baudelaire had an hour to live.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.958
[Olaf] We definitely
haven't been this way. Wait.

02:09.041 --> 02:12.208
[panting] Sunny has less than an hour.
We have to find an antidote!

02:12.291 --> 02:14.791
Fiona will know what to do.
She has books on fungi in her library.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.083
We have to get to the  Queequeg.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.750
-Well, now which way?
-We have to go back.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.583
Don't be ridiculous!
We just came from there.

02:19.666 --> 02:21.750
Sunny's been poisoned.
If we don't go back, she'll die!

02:21.833 --> 02:24.375
Fine with me. I only need one of you alive
to get your fortune.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.583
Serves her right for coming back
without the sugar bowl.

02:26.666 --> 02:27.541
It's this way!

02:28.333 --> 02:30.000
We have to find an antidote!

02:30.083 --> 02:33.541
Yes, well, I anti-don't care.
Tee-hee, ticklish!

02:33.625 --> 02:34.958
Tort-tort, turmeric!

[screams]

02:37.625 --> 02:38.833
[Olaf] Hey, hey, hey!

02:38.916 --> 02:40.625
Not so fast!

02:40.708 --> 02:43.458
[panting] Sunny's life depends on us!

02:43.541 --> 02:47.541
Uh, I think you're confused.
Your life depends on me.

02:48.541 --> 02:50.041
Now let me be clear.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.916
If I wanted, I could drown you in the sea,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.208
or have you strangled by the arms
of this mechanical octopus.

02:56.291 --> 02:59.750
It is only through the kindness
of my heart and greed

02:59.833 --> 03:03.000
that I am throwing you in the brig
and torturing you instead!

03:03.083 --> 03:04.916
Now let's get moving!
Which way?

03:05.750 --> 03:06.708
To the right!

03:11.291 --> 03:13.166
The left. When I said right, I meant left.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.291
[Lemony]  I beg of you,

03:14.375 --> 03:16.916
turn the corner
on this unfortunate episode,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.375
for like the respiratory system
of poor, poor Sunny Baudelaire...

03:20.458 --> 03:21.500
[coughing]

03:21.583 --> 03:27.250
...the Baudelaires' situation
still has time to get much, much worse.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.625
Follow me, orphans.
The Snow Scouts.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.333
Row faster, you cakesniffers!

03:32.416 --> 03:33.500
[Violet] And Carmelita.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.500
Hiya, Baudelaires!
Phil! You're alive!

03:35.583 --> 03:36.541
Oh, better than alive.

03:36.625 --> 03:39.500
Just think, yesterday I had one job
on a submarine.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.666
Today, I have two!

03:41.750 --> 03:43.833
I'm a rower and a swabber!

03:44.291 --> 03:46.583
Well, let's hurry along before we
Countie!

03:46.666 --> 03:49.666
You're just in time
for my special dance recital.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.000
[all groaning] Please, no!

03:52.083 --> 03:55.166
Carmelita is  the  most talented dancer
in the universe!

03:55.250 --> 03:58.000
When you see her dance,
your eyes will bleed with gratitude

03:58.083 --> 04:00.416
until it all clots up
and you get an eye infection.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.500
I can vouch for that!

04:01.583 --> 04:04.458
You are gonna stay and watch my recital,

04:04.958 --> 04:06.291
aren't you, Countie?

04:06.375 --> 04:09.625
I'm busy. I have to throw the Baudelaires
into the brig.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.666
You like the Baudelaires more than me?!

04:11.750 --> 04:14.541
I'll have Hooky torture these orphans.
You stay here and...

04:15.500 --> 04:16.583
torture those orphans.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.583
Tell him to be extra vicious
with those brats! I want the location of--

04:19.666 --> 04:21.791
The sugar bowl. I know, I know!

04:22.625 --> 04:24.750
Welcome to the brig, Baudelaires.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.458
That's the pirate word for jail.

04:26.541 --> 04:29.458
Please let us get back to the  Queequeg.
Can't you see Sunny coughing?

04:29.541 --> 04:33.083
-[coughing]
-Of course. I can also see me not caring.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.083
[coughing continues]

04:35.166 --> 04:37.708
Oh, she's really coughing her lungs out.
She's going to die!

04:37.791 --> 04:40.125
Finally we agree on something.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.291
[door locks]

04:42.625 --> 04:44.958
Hang on, Sunny. We're gonna get help.

[sunny wheezes]

04:47.208 --> 04:48.041
[coughing]

04:48.875 --> 04:51.833
How are we supposed to get out of here?
We're locked in the brig.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.250
We've broken out of prison before.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.166
That was a jailhouse
made of brick and mortar.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.333
[stammering] This is a submarine.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.500
Those walls are reinforced steel.

04:59.583 --> 05:00.875
There has to be some--

05:02.000 --> 05:03.583
Going somewhere?

05:03.666 --> 05:07.125
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, orphans.
I'm here to torture you.

05:07.208 --> 05:10.125
You can torture us all you want.
I am gonna torture you all I want.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.583
We don't know where the sugar bowl is,
and we don't care. Sunny--

05:13.666 --> 05:14.500
Shh!

05:14.916 --> 05:16.750
Now, the boss has questions, and so do I.

05:16.833 --> 05:19.500
Why were you on the  Queequeg?
What are you playing at?

05:20.500 --> 05:21.333
Where's the baby?

05:21.416 --> 05:22.875
She's in bed. She's sick.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.000
If we don't get her back to the  Queequeg,
she'll die.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.250
I don't have time for tricks!

05:26.333 --> 05:27.916
[coughing]

05:28.000 --> 05:31.083
I saved your life on that mountain, baby,
and the boss has made me suffer for it.

05:31.166 --> 05:34.000
But I think that suffering is like
a family dinner. It should be shared.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.500
[coughing]

05:35.583 --> 05:37.500
Let me just take off that stupid helmet.
No!

05:39.375 --> 05:40.583
[spluttering]

05:40.666 --> 05:42.708
She's infected with the Medusoid Mycelium.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.375
Do you know how dangerous that fungus is?

05:47.458 --> 05:49.625
Oh, no. The spores are already taking root
in her throat!

05:49.708 --> 05:52.291
We have to get out of here!
You have to help us, please!

05:52.958 --> 05:54.166
She's our sister.

06:09.375 --> 06:10.500
It's gonna be okay.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.375
The rowing room
is around the curve to the right.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.583
From there, it's a series
of confusing twists and turns

06:20.666 --> 06:22.833
that took me hours and hours
of walking to memorize.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.416
Right, then left, then another right,
then right again,

06:25.500 --> 06:27.916
then two more lefts
and you'll be back at the  Queequeg.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.208
That's right, left,
right, right, left, left.

06:30.750 --> 06:31.750
Show-off.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.416
Don't think this means
I'm on your side, orphans.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.375
You rotten brats
have made my life miserable.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.875
Every time we fail to get your fortune,
Count Olaf yells at me.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.666
You're the one
who makes our lives miserable!

06:40.750 --> 06:42.875
Count Olaf performs terrible schemes,
and you help him!

06:42.958 --> 06:44.583
-Let's just agree to disagree.
-[coughing]

06:44.666 --> 06:47.125
Shh! Sorry, baby.
You're gonna have to be quiet.

06:47.916 --> 06:48.833
Here.

06:50.833 --> 06:51.708
All right.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.500
I'll go see if the coast is clear.

06:53.583 --> 06:54.916

06:56.041 --> 06:57.125
[Hooky] Oh! Oh!

06:57.208 --> 06:58.458
You scared me!

06:58.541 --> 06:59.666
You scared me, boss.

07:00.416 --> 07:02.708
Uh, what's wrong?
What? Nothing. Nothing.

07:02.791 --> 07:05.041
No, I'm just taking a stroll
down one of the many corridors

07:05.125 --> 07:07.125
of my enormous submarine.
What could be wrong?

07:07.208 --> 07:08.791
If you're lost, I can help.
Thank you.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.708
I'm looking for the room
where we keep the wine.

07:10.791 --> 07:11.750
Oh, the galley.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.083
No. The wine room. It's this way, right?

07:14.166 --> 07:15.958
No, it's this way, left. Let me show you.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.291
Aren't you supposed to be
torturing orphans right now?

07:18.375 --> 07:22.208
I was headed to the galley--
to the wine room, to sharpen my hooks...

07:22.708 --> 07:25.500
um, so that I could... uh...

07:25.583 --> 07:29.208
poke their orphany skin with minimal
effort while achieving maximum pain.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.916
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Hooky.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.083
Thanks, boss.
But you're still not family.

07:34.166 --> 07:37.333
Now, off to the wine room!
I could use a nice  Caber-net.

07:42.291 --> 07:46.458
For my third number, I'm going to twirl
around while you clap as hard as you can!

07:46.541 --> 07:47.541
[boy] Carmelita, please.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.333
We've been rowing for hours.

07:49.416 --> 07:50.625
My hands are too sore to clap.

07:50.708 --> 07:51.666
[children moan]

07:51.750 --> 07:54.166
After we save Sunny,
we have to help those kids.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.458
We have to get past
Carmelita and Esmé first.

07:57.416 --> 07:58.458
[sighs]

07:59.791 --> 08:02.416
We need to create a distraction
to get back to the  Queequeg.

08:02.500 --> 08:06.416
Then once Sunny's safe, we can find a way
to free those Snow Scouts. Violet?

08:09.083 --> 08:09.916
Violet?

08:10.291 --> 08:11.750
Maybe we can do both.

08:12.416 --> 08:13.666
We need to create a sea monster.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.708
-Baudelaires, what's going on?
-We need your help.

09:48.791 --> 09:50.750
We encountered
the Medusoid Mycelium in the grotto.

09:50.833 --> 09:51.833
Sunny's been infected.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.208
We need to find an antidote.
She's getting worse.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.166
How did you escape?
Did you find the sugar bowl?

09:56.250 --> 09:58.541
-It's with someone we trust.
-We didn't escape.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.708
Olaf's henchman let us get away,
the one with hooks.

10:00.791 --> 10:03.500
Where is he?
He's distracting Olaf, but we got away.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.625
Can you help us save Sunny?

10:04.708 --> 10:06.708
Aye. She who hesitates is lost.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.583
This is where I read
about the Medusoid Mycelium.

10:08.666 --> 10:09.916
[coughing]

10:10.000 --> 10:10.833
Hurry!

10:10.916 --> 10:12.500
Chapter 40, "The Gorgonian Grotto."

10:12.583 --> 10:15.000
"The fast-acting poison
makes the mushroom extremely volatile."

10:15.083 --> 10:16.416
Does it say anything about a cure?

10:16.500 --> 10:18.750
"Currently Very Fancy Doctors
are searching for an antidote

10:18.833 --> 10:21.458
at a facility near Lousy Lane,
but have not come up with a cure yet."

10:21.541 --> 10:22.875
Very Fancy Doctors. V.F.D.

10:22.958 --> 10:25.083
It's an old book. Maybe V.F.D.
have found a cure by now.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.083
Could we send
a Volunteer Factual Dispatch?

10:27.166 --> 10:29.291
My telegraph was smashed
when Olaf searched the sub.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.125
-We can repair it.
-[Klaus] Hang on, Sunny.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.625
-We're close, I promise.
-The machine isn't broken too badly.

10:33.708 --> 10:34.875
We can use tape.
And pliers.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.083
[together] And library paste.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.291
There's an annotation in the margin.
What does it say?

10:38.375 --> 10:39.958
Well, it's a poem.

10:40.041 --> 10:43.958
"Is dilution simple? But of course.
Just one small dose of root of horse."

10:44.041 --> 10:47.000
Dilution is another word for antidote.
But horses don't have roots.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.541
Plants do. Plants are often used
to make antidotes.

10:49.625 --> 10:52.083
The book said scientists were working
on a cure near Lousy Lane.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.500
We drove down Lousy Lane on our way
to live with Uncle Monty.

10:54.583 --> 10:57.416
I remember the smell.
It was terrible, like black pepper.

10:57.708 --> 10:58.625
No, not pepper.

10:58.708 --> 10:59.791
Root of horse...

11:01.916 --> 11:03.083
[all] Horseradish.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.916
Gum! There's nothing in this cupboard
but boxes of gum!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.083
I found the spice rack,
but there's no horseradish.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.416
Just a lot of wasabi and tarragon.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.458
What about the fridge?

11:16.208 --> 11:17.125
Lemon-lime soda.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.958
Gorgonzola cheese.
And what's that?

11:19.541 --> 11:20.458
[Klaus] Your birthday.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.041
I forgot.
Sunny didn't.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.791
That must be the surprise
she and Phil were cooking up.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.083
We can't lose Sunny.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.416
We can't lose her!

11:35.166 --> 11:38.083
We've researched an antidote,
but only horseradish can save you.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.708
-There's no horseradish in the kitchen.
-[babbling]

11:47.166 --> 11:49.125
The expression "the tables have turned"

11:49.208 --> 11:52.708
is not one the Baudelaire orphans
had much occasion to use.

11:52.791 --> 11:55.333
It refers to a situation
that has suddenly been reversed

11:55.416 --> 11:57.125
so that those who are
in a powerless position

11:57.208 --> 12:00.458
suddenly find themselves
in a powerful one,   and vice versa.

12:01.375 --> 12:05.708
Sunny knew that adventurous cooking
often necessitates quick substitutions,

12:05.791 --> 12:08.708
so when she suggested
a horseradish substitute,

12:08.791 --> 12:11.250
Klaus hurriedly opened the jar of wasabi

12:11.333 --> 12:14.291
and spooned the spicy, green mixture
into Sunny's mouth,

12:14.666 --> 12:17.250
it seemed like the tables
might turn after all.

12:18.916 --> 12:20.416
[panting] It's working.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.750
We've turned the tables
on that terrible fungus.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.250
You saved yourself.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.083
We had wasabi the entire time,

12:29.166 --> 12:31.166
but we didn't think to use it
until you told us.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.875
[beeping]

12:49.250 --> 12:50.083
Aha!

12:50.458 --> 12:52.208
I found the tool to sharpen my hooks.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.083
I'm off to torture orphans now.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.041
I'll join you.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.041
Those pesky brats
cause me nothing but grief.

12:58.291 --> 13:01.583
I want to see the look on their faces
while you make them suffer.

13:01.666 --> 13:04.208
Get up close and personal to their pain.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.708
Savor them like a fine wine.

13:08.291 --> 13:09.375
Or this wine.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.958
But first, I want a sandwich.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.416
I can make you one, boss.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.416
Now that my schemes
have bore orphan fruit,

13:18.916 --> 13:22.458
there's only one thing in the world
that my heart desires,

13:22.541 --> 13:23.958
besides a sandwich.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.875
My mentors think that I'm small.

13:29.458 --> 13:30.458
A failure.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.041
I need to show them.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.791
Actually, it sounds
like your heart's desire

13:34.875 --> 13:37.875
is to win the love and approval of your
parental figures. I can relate to that.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.291
That's not what I'm saying at all.

13:39.375 --> 13:43.916
I need to do something big and dramatic
to get back at those V.F.D. goody-goodies.

13:44.541 --> 13:47.041
Ideally something
that doesn't require any work.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.166
But how?

13:48.750 --> 13:54.750
If only some powerful, convenient way
to destroy a whole bunch of people

13:54.833 --> 13:58.625
was placed into my hands right now
like a sandwich.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.500
Here's your submarine sandwich.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.833
Well, it's torture time.
I'm off to the brig.

14:02.916 --> 14:04.208
Wait.

14:08.875 --> 14:11.375
Disengage from the  Queequeg.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.083
But you smashed its equipment.
If you disengage, it's going to sink.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.000
Bah!

14:15.083 --> 14:18.250
There's nothing left on that wreck
but rusty pipes and poetry books.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.625
Widdershins and his fondness
for limericks.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.500
Literary and annoying.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.625
Nah...

14:23.708 --> 14:25.333
You know, I don't know. Maybe...

14:26.250 --> 14:28.041
Maybe we don't need to disengage
right away.

14:28.125 --> 14:28.958
Why?

14:29.666 --> 14:31.750
Is there something you're not telling me?

14:33.000 --> 14:33.833
No...

14:35.041 --> 14:36.125
No, no.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.916
I'll... I'll disengage right away.

14:49.625 --> 14:50.500
It worked.

14:50.583 --> 14:53.083
She's sleeping now, but she'll be up
biting again in no time.

14:53.166 --> 14:56.083
I'm glad she's okay.
We couldn't have done it without you.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.458
I sealed the helmet
with a dinner plate and some chewing gum

14:58.541 --> 15:00.000
so the fungus can't get out.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.500
You didn't destroy it?
No, we saved it for you.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.916
It's a valuable specimen
for a talented mycologist.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.500
This is an incredible find.

15:07.208 --> 15:10.791
The poison of a volatile fungus can be
the source of some powerful medicines.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.125
Well, maybe something good
can come out of something bad.

15:15.541 --> 15:16.875
Are you all right?

15:17.916 --> 15:18.750
Aye.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.250
I'm glad Sunny is safe.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.375
And it's a good thing
you fixed the telegraph machine,

15:22.458 --> 15:25.083
-or this message couldn't come through.
-"Attention: all volunteers."

15:25.166 --> 15:27.166
"Please arrive by Thursday
to the Last Safe Place..."

15:27.250 --> 15:28.166
"The Hotel Denouement."

15:28.250 --> 15:30.666
And it's signed "J.S."
Like the initials from the headquarters.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.083
Our parents went to the Hotel Denouement
a long time ago.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.000
It's a seaside hotel.
We can take the sub there.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.625
I'll start charting a course.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.208
I'll repair the damage to the sub.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.541
I repaired the damage myself,
but we're not going anywhere.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.708
What do you mean?
Captain's orders. We wait.

15:44.791 --> 15:46.291
For what?
We don't have time to wait.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.833
Count Olaf could discover we're missing.
She who hesitates--

15:48.916 --> 15:50.958
I'm not hesitating. I'm deciding.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.208
We're not leaving.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.416
Not yet.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
Whatever this is about, you can tell us.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.958
She not gonna tell us anything.
She's hiding something.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.458
She's not hiding anything!

16:00.500 --> 16:01.500
Fernald!

16:02.541 --> 16:03.500
Fiona!

16:05.041 --> 16:06.791
This is a volatile situation.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.875
[Lemony]  As the Baudelaires knew,
the word "volatile" means "unstable"

16:09.958 --> 16:11.291
or "likely to cause trouble."

16:11.375 --> 16:12.708
I thought I'd never see you again.

16:12.791 --> 16:16.125
And it can apply to people
as well as to poisonous mushrooms.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.916
You probably have a person or two
in your life who is like that.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.875
Perhaps even a sibling.

16:22.958 --> 16:24.250
When this person pops up,

16:24.333 --> 16:25.916
trouble may wax.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.541
And when they vanish...

16:30.083 --> 16:31.333
trouble may wane.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.166
But not always.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.500
For years, contacting my own siblings
brought them nothing but trouble,

16:43.583 --> 16:46.708
so it was easier
to let them believe I was dead.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.958
Now, of course,
it is my brother who is dead,

16:50.041 --> 16:53.291
and I do not know
if I will ever see my sister again.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.666
Are you working for Count Olaf?

16:55.750 --> 16:56.750
Never mind that.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.625
You joined up with the Baudelaires?

16:58.708 --> 17:01.208
Well, they joined up with me.
So Step-Pop's really gone?

17:01.291 --> 17:03.916
Aye. He told me you died
in a manatee accident.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.958
What? No, I left.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.541
I told him I never wanted to see his face
again, but I'm sorry I left you alone.

17:09.625 --> 17:10.750
He's your brother?

17:10.833 --> 17:14.000
He found me when he was searching the sub,
but we didn't have time to talk.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.250
He's a terrible villain!

17:15.333 --> 17:17.583
He's helped Count Olaf perform
countless treacherous deeds!

17:17.666 --> 17:19.333
He also saved your sister.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.291
Wait. Where is the baby? Is she okay?

17:21.375 --> 17:24.166
She's resting, and she's fine.
We found the antidote to the poison,

17:24.250 --> 17:27.291
and now we're headed to meet the rest
of the volunteers at the Hotel Denouement,

17:27.375 --> 17:28.250
the Last Safe Place.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.708
And you could come with us.

17:29.791 --> 17:31.375
We're not going anywhere with him!

17:31.458 --> 17:33.208
I'm not abandoning my brother!

17:33.291 --> 17:35.250
He's my only family!
[Klaus] He's dangerous!

17:35.333 --> 17:37.625
He's wicked!
He burned down Anwhistle Aquatics!

17:37.708 --> 17:39.666
I read about it
in a Volunteer Factual Dispatch.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.166
It said Fernald betrayed V.F.D.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.541
He committed arson
and joined the wrong side of the schism.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.791
You still don't get it.
There is no wrong side of the schism.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.000
[Violet] Of course there is.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.333
One side puts out fires,
and the other side starts them.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.125
You should have seen the fire.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.083
I was an apprentice at Anwhistle Aquatics

17:57.166 --> 18:00.625
when I learned what Gregor Anwhistle
was cultivating in his grotto:

18:00.708 --> 18:02.125
a fungus so powerful

18:02.208 --> 18:05.583
it could destroy V.F.D.'s enemies
once and for all.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.875
He was playing with fire.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.791
I warned him it was volatile.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.666
If the fungus got out,
it could destroy everyone.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.500
But he didn't listen.

18:15.208 --> 18:18.958
So I decided to fight fire with fire.

18:19.583 --> 18:23.291
I'll never forget the sight of it,
like the sea was burning.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.666
It was the worst day of my life.

18:26.625 --> 18:28.375
But what choice did I have?

18:30.750 --> 18:31.583
Oh, no!

18:33.541 --> 18:37.291
I did a terrible thing for a noble reason,
and I paid for it.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.875
I lost my hands in the fire,
and I got kicked out of V.F.D.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.375
My step-dad was so furious.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.833
He never told me why you did it.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.666
He just said there were secrets
too terrible for young people to know.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.833
He used to say that to me, too.
He was a fool.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.666
He is not a fool. He is a noble man.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.458
And V.F.D. is a noble organization.

18:55.541 --> 18:57.666
They'd never cultivate something
that would harm people.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.375
Tell that to your little sister.

18:59.916 --> 19:01.291
Well, what about Count Olaf?

19:01.375 --> 19:03.708
He's a wicked person,
and you help him time and time again.

19:03.791 --> 19:06.208
Count Olaf took me in
when no one else would have me.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.041
Sure, I ended up doing more murder, arson,

19:08.125 --> 19:10.041
and assorted violence
than I would have preferred,

19:10.125 --> 19:12.041
but people aren't either wicked or noble.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.250
They're like chef's salads,

19:13.333 --> 19:16.333
with good things and bad things
chopped up and mixed together

19:16.416 --> 19:18.541
in a vinaigrette
of confusion and conflict.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.916
I mean, look at you, Baudelaires.

19:20.666 --> 19:23.750
You helped burn down Caligari Carnival.
You've played with fire, too.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.625
We're nothing like you.
Or Count Olaf.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.416
You only know the bad aspects of him.
He has his good parts.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.375
Like what?

19:30.791 --> 19:31.916
Well, he, uh...

19:34.458 --> 19:36.125
[Fernald] Uh... Wait.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.750
He has a wonderful laugh.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.291
[Olaf] Ha, ha, ha.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.166
Ha, ha, ha.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.166
[creaking]

19:49.416 --> 19:50.583
There you are.

19:50.666 --> 19:53.125
My girlfriend said we should ditch you
when you didn't come back,

19:53.208 --> 19:55.666
-but I said, "Not without Hooky."
-[Esmé] Who would do the cooking?

19:55.750 --> 19:56.750
Heehee, hot pot!

19:56.833 --> 19:58.458
Hahaha, harpy!

19:58.750 --> 20:00.833
Hahaha, half-wit!

20:00.916 --> 20:03.625
Anyway, we rounded up the Snow Scouts,

20:03.708 --> 20:05.291
and so we're ready to take off.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.291
Who's the chick with the glasses?
I thought you said this sub was empty.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.125
It was, boss!
Or at least I thought it was.

20:11.208 --> 20:14.166
I have no idea who this girl is
or where she came from, I swear.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.583
[laughs]

20:19.666 --> 20:21.541
Look what I found.

20:22.416 --> 20:24.666
A couple of cakesniffers
trying to sneak away.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.416
How did you escape the brig?
I locked you in there with

20:29.833 --> 20:31.208
Turncoat!

20:31.625 --> 20:33.833
Wait, boss!
That was your last chance.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.541
Do you know what pirates do to traitors?

20:36.625 --> 20:39.166
Don't hurt him!
My brother would never betray you!

20:39.250 --> 20:40.083
Your brother?

20:40.458 --> 20:42.000
Well, hello.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.916
The last time I saw you, I was throwing
thumbtacks into your cradle,

20:46.291 --> 20:47.750
but now you're all grown up,

20:48.125 --> 20:50.500
and you get to watch your brother die.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.708
[groans]

20:53.750 --> 20:55.708
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.
Help, please.

20:55.791 --> 20:57.833
He didn't betray you, and I can prove it.

20:57.916 --> 20:59.875
He didn't free the Baudelaires
so they could escape.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.958
He let them go so he could give you this.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.291
[Violet] No!
What are you doing?

21:03.375 --> 21:06.625
Well, I appreciate the gesture,
but I prefer a smaller, lighter hat.

21:06.708 --> 21:09.875
Inside this helmet is a specimen
of Medusoid Mycelium.

21:10.208 --> 21:11.625
That's what made Sunny sick.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.291
Medusoid Mycelium?

21:16.125 --> 21:18.291
I thought this was destroyed
in the Anwhistle fire.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.791
[panting]

21:19.875 --> 21:20.916
I thought so too.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.916
How marvelously poisonous!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.291
Nice work, Hooky.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.958
You too, you little fungal freak.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.125
My name is Fiona.

21:29.208 --> 21:32.166
That's not a very "in" name.
I'm calling you Triangle Eyes.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.541
Baudelaires,
when you are back in the brig,

21:35.625 --> 21:38.333
I'm going to open this helmet
and toss it inside,

21:38.416 --> 21:42.250
and then you will suffer
like I've always wanted you to suffer.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.125
No! You shouldn't waste the specimen
on the Baudelaires.

21:45.458 --> 21:46.375
It's too valuable.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.333
Triangle Eyes is right.

21:48.416 --> 21:50.833
There are far more important people
who deserve to be poisoned.

21:50.916 --> 21:51.875
That's a good point.

21:52.333 --> 21:56.541
I was just thinking how nice it would be
to have some powerful, convenient way

21:56.625 --> 21:59.666
to destroy a bunch of people
placed into my hands, wasn't I, Hooky?

21:59.750 --> 22:02.416
His name is Fernald.
And I call him Hooky.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.833
You've got a lot of moxie, kid.

22:05.916 --> 22:08.916
How would you like to join your brother
on my crew?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.041
We could use the help.

22:10.125 --> 22:13.000
-Those Snow Scouts are terrible rowers.
-[Carmelita] Hm-mm.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.291
Look around.

22:16.708 --> 22:19.000
Your stepfather abandoned you.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.916
Your submarine has been captured.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.625
Even your new friends
only care about themselves.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.666
That's not true.
[Olaf] Really?

22:28.083 --> 22:31.958
Because I thought you Baudelaires
always put your siblings first.

22:32.791 --> 22:35.541
Fiona, please don't do this.
Please don't do it.

22:37.208 --> 22:38.625
What choice do I have?

22:40.875 --> 22:42.083
[Olaf chuckles]

22:42.458 --> 22:45.041
Let's sink this wreck
and torture the prisoners.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.875
I only need one orphan alive
to get their fortune.

22:47.958 --> 22:50.583
I can test the fungus on the other two.

23:00.916 --> 23:01.958
[squeaking]

23:02.041 --> 23:03.333
[Olaf] Baudelaires...

23:03.416 --> 23:06.000
for too long, you have spoiled my plans.

23:06.083 --> 23:09.500
A nice cycle for you,
an unprofitable one for me.

23:09.583 --> 23:12.291
But now that cycle
has finally been broken.

23:12.916 --> 23:15.125
You should have given up a long time ago.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.375
Darling, I'm stuck.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.791
I triumphed
the moment you lost your family.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.750
We didn't lose our family.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.125
Only our parents.

23:24.208 --> 23:25.500
Our family is right here.

23:25.583 --> 23:28.083
Oh, darling, I can't move.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.750
You will lose everything, orphans.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.625
Wait and see.

23:39.541 --> 23:41.875
[Esmé] Okay, that's all right now.
That's absolutely fine.

23:42.416 --> 23:45.166
Triangle Eyes, find the baby
and bring the Baudelaires to the brig.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.208
Ayeaye, Captain.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.000
Hooky, we need to talk.

23:52.250 --> 23:55.291
You heard him.
Get to the brig, you biscuiteaters!

23:55.541 --> 23:57.541
That's pirate for an insulting term!

23:57.625 --> 23:59.208
[door slams and locks]

23:59.875 --> 24:01.083
Quick, we don't have much time.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.375
You're not taking us to the brig?
Of course not.

24:03.458 --> 24:04.625
I'm letting you escape.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.208
But you'd better hurry
before Count Olaf notices.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.875
Come with us. We can go
to the Last Safe Place together.

24:09.958 --> 24:11.500
I can't abandon my brother.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.375
No matter what he's done,
he's the only family I have.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.250
I understand.

24:20.458 --> 24:24.208
There's a troupe of kidnapped Snow Scouts
on that sub. Can you help them?

24:24.291 --> 24:25.166
Aye.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.666
Take care of the  Queequeg  for me.

24:30.041 --> 24:30.875
Aye.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.208
Please don't go with Olaf.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.000
You're not a wicked person.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.958
People aren't either wicked or noble.

24:39.541 --> 24:40.958
They're like chef salads.

24:41.291 --> 24:44.583
When you think of me,
think of a food you love very much.

25:02.166 --> 25:05.583
How can someone so wonderful
do something so terrible?

25:06.125 --> 25:07.583
She let us go.

25:09.333 --> 25:13.125
She's right. We'd better hurry before
Count Olaf notices we're not in the brig.

25:13.208 --> 25:14.166
Let's go.

25:21.000 --> 25:21.916
Hey, boss.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.125
Thanks for being so understanding
about my--

25:24.708 --> 25:26.500
Do you think I believe that story?

25:26.583 --> 25:28.625
You were going to desert me.

25:28.708 --> 25:31.958
I think strangling your sister
might teach you a lesson.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.166
Don't hurt Fiona.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.125
Give me one reason not to.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.416
I'll give you the location
of the Last Safe Place.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.666
The who, what, when, why?

25:39.750 --> 25:41.500
Where all V.F.D. is gathering.

25:44.458 --> 25:47.208
You're my favorite again,   Ferndale.

25:47.291 --> 25:48.833
Fernald.
Furnail.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.333
I'm taking all three of you Baudelaires
to the brig!

25:51.416 --> 25:54.291
Get to the brig, you biscuiteaters!

25:54.375 --> 25:55.958
I think I'll stick with Hooky.

25:56.625 --> 25:58.250
Get in there, Baudelaires!

26:01.541 --> 26:03.541
Or I'll feed you to a manatee!

26:05.125 --> 26:07.708
Nice work, Triangle Eyes.

26:08.666 --> 26:10.333
Now make me a pizza.

26:10.416 --> 26:12.583
[Olaf] Disengage from the  Queequeg.

26:13.166 --> 26:14.000
Okay?

26:21.250 --> 26:24.458
Fiona did a great job with the repairs.
We'll be out of here in no time.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.833
I'll chart a course
to the Hotel Denouement.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.208
Good news is the  Carmelita  is gone.

26:29.291 --> 26:31.625
Great news,
although you don't sound happy about it.

26:31.708 --> 26:34.041
That's because The Great Unknown
is headed straight for us.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.625
What can we do?

26:39.666 --> 26:41.583
[Violet]
I'm putting the sub into turbo drive.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.666
Hold on.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.083
[Violet]
Let's hope the engine doesn't blow.

26:45.166 --> 26:47.166
[screeching]

26:48.041 --> 26:51.208
I am happier than a pig eating pork.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.833
I am tickled pinker
than a sunburned Caucasian.

26:54.916 --> 26:56.625
I am so happy-go-lucky

26:56.708 --> 26:58.083
that happy and lucky people

26:58.166 --> 27:00.000
are going to beat me senseless
with a stake

27:00.083 --> 27:02.625
out of total unbridled jealousy.

27:03.458 --> 27:07.083
Soon, we will be arriving
at the Hotel Denouement,

27:07.166 --> 27:10.000
where I will unleash the Medusoid Mycelium

27:10.083 --> 27:14.958
and end V.F.D. and their stupid codes
and poetry once and for all!

27:15.041 --> 27:20.125
Teehee, taha, to-ho-tal annihilation!

27:20.208 --> 27:22.083
We still haven't found
the sugar bowl, darling.

27:22.166 --> 27:26.041
With our luck, Esmé, the sugar bowl
will come falling out of the sky!

27:26.125 --> 27:27.375
[laughs]

27:27.458 --> 27:28.833
Ooh, wait a minute.

27:29.333 --> 27:30.666
That wasn't a fake laugh.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.041
That was real.

27:32.791 --> 27:35.875
Esmé, I finally found something
to laugh about.

27:36.791 --> 27:39.458
[evil laughter]

27:39.541 --> 27:42.125
[laughing and whooping]

27:44.541 --> 27:47.625
[laughing and cackling]

27:47.708 --> 27:50.000
I never should have given the fungus
to Count Olaf.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.250
You did a terrible thing
for a noble reason.

27:52.958 --> 27:54.125
You saved my life.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.416
Oh, oh, oh! Esmé, let's go laugh
at the Baudelaires in the brig.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.458
[laughing hysterically]

28:01.916 --> 28:05.250
[laughing and whooping]

28:06.250 --> 28:07.208
What do we do now?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.000
We're at a crossroads.

28:11.541 --> 28:13.291
[Klaus]
The Great Unknown is falling behind.

28:13.375 --> 28:16.541
Maximum knots, and the propulsion motor
is dangerously close to blowing.

28:16.625 --> 28:18.125
[Violet] The motor's not going to hold.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.041
We need a place to surface.
A beach or a dock.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.166
I can find a place
near the Hotel Denouement.

28:25.583 --> 28:26.416
Klaus...

28:27.375 --> 28:28.625
Do you think we'll find Quigley?

28:28.708 --> 28:31.125
I'm sure we'll find him... wherever he is.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.333
[birds cawing]

28:39.416 --> 28:41.791
[Lemony]  The water cycle consists
of three phenomena:

28:41.875 --> 28:44.958
evaporation, precipitation,
and collection.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.416
Occasionally,
while I'm collecting evidence

28:48.500 --> 28:50.916
concerning the history
of the Baudelaire orphans,

28:51.541 --> 28:53.916
I imagine myself as a drop of water,

28:54.000 --> 28:58.541
especially if it is raining
or if my desk is floating in a reservoir.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.416
It is not a pleasant feeling.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.500
I think about how ghastly it would feel

29:03.583 --> 29:05.958
to be yanked away from my comrades,

29:06.041 --> 29:08.541
when we were gathered
in a lake or a puddle,

29:08.625 --> 29:13.000
and forced into the sky
through the process of evaporation.

29:14.041 --> 29:16.625
Think how terrible it would feel
to be chased out of a cloud

29:16.708 --> 29:18.625
by the process of precipitation,

29:18.708 --> 29:20.208
and tumble to the earth...

29:20.916 --> 29:22.125
like a sugar bowl.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.625
[birds cawing]

29:29.375 --> 29:31.625
How heartbroken I would feel

29:31.708 --> 29:34.250
to gather once more in a body of water

29:34.333 --> 29:36.041
and feel that I had reached...

29:36.833 --> 29:38.875
the Last Safe Place...

29:40.375 --> 29:44.875
only to have the tables turn,
and evaporate into the sky once more,

29:44.958 --> 29:48.458
as the tedious cycle
started all over again.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.166
I found the closest beach.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.375
It is awful to contemplate

29:52.458 --> 29:55.416
this sort of life   in which one would
always be forced into motion

29:55.500 --> 29:58.333
by a variety of mysterious
and powerful forces,

29:58.416 --> 30:00.250
never finding a safe place,

30:00.333 --> 30:03.041
never able to turn the tables
for very long.

30:03.125 --> 30:04.708
[waves crashing]

30:09.583 --> 30:11.541
For the same reason,
the Baudelaire orphans

30:11.625 --> 30:15.416
found it awful to contemplate their
own lives as their submarine landed

30:15.500 --> 30:20.416
at the very place where their cycle
of unfortunate events began.

30:24.583 --> 30:26.708
It's like we're starting the cycle
all over again.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.000
[man coughing]

30:29.166 --> 30:30.375
[coughing continues]

30:30.458 --> 30:31.625
Baudelaires?

30:31.708 --> 30:34.125
What are you doing here
on Briny Beach... again?

30:34.208 --> 30:36.666
What are you doing here?
I'd given up all hope of finding you,

30:36.750 --> 30:38.083
and I decided to visit this beach

30:38.166 --> 30:41.000
to indulge in some sadness and rock
skipping instead of searching for you,

30:41.083 --> 30:43.208
which frankly
has given me nothing but tsuris.

30:43.291 --> 30:44.500
"Tsuris" means trouble.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.000
We know what tsuris means.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.125
Where have you been,
and how did you get here?

30:48.208 --> 30:49.083
[Kit] Baudelaires!

30:49.541 --> 30:51.208
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.875
Is that my new secretary?
What are you doing here?

30:53.958 --> 30:55.458
When you didn't show up at the office,

30:55.541 --> 30:57.333
I figured you were either sick
or giving birth.

30:57.416 --> 31:00.333
My apologies, Mr. Poe, but perhaps
you forgot I don't work for you.

31:00.416 --> 31:03.833
It is customary to give at least ten days'
notice when resigning a position, Ms...

31:03.916 --> 31:04.791
Miss...

31:05.500 --> 31:06.375
Ms...

31:07.458 --> 31:09.791
I seem to have forgotten your name.
I never gave it to you.

31:09.875 --> 31:11.083
Ah, then it's your fault.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.500
My cab is just over there,
and I'd be happy to drive you

31:13.583 --> 31:15.916
to the Last Safe Place,
if that's still where you want to go.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.083
Baudelaires, I insist you come with me.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.625
You've been accused of murder, arson,

31:19.708 --> 31:21.666
kidnapping, and all sorts
of assorted misdemeanors.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.083
We're innocent!
I'm sure you are,

31:23.166 --> 31:24.791
but that's why
you need to come with me

31:24.875 --> 31:26.875
to the police station
so we can sort everything out.

31:27.916 --> 31:30.041
Since you ran away from your problems,
it became clear

31:30.125 --> 31:31.625
that the stem of your troubles

31:31.708 --> 31:34.458
is from not having a clear guardian figure
in your life.

31:34.958 --> 31:37.166
Perhaps it's time
for that guardian to be me.

31:37.958 --> 31:40.541
You know how good I am with children.
So, come along, Baudelaires!

31:40.625 --> 31:42.958
Let's end this unfortunate cycle
once and for all!

31:43.041 --> 31:45.291
You're right.
I know I am. That's why I said it.

31:45.375 --> 31:48.041
We have to break this cycle.
That's why we can't go with you.

31:48.125 --> 31:49.375
But... don't be ridiculous.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.333
I don't know where you've been,
how you got here,

31:51.416 --> 31:53.875
or why you're wearing a picture
of Santa Claus on your uniforms.

31:53.958 --> 31:54.791
Herman Melville.

31:54.875 --> 31:55.833
I beg your pardon?

31:55.916 --> 31:57.916
The picture on their uniforms
is Herman Melville.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.250
He's one of my favorite authors.

31:59.333 --> 32:02.000
I like the way he dramatizes
the plight of overlooked groups,

32:02.083 --> 32:04.083
like poor sailors and young people.

32:04.750 --> 32:05.583
Me too.

32:05.666 --> 32:08.333
I'm not surprised.
He was one of your parents' favorites.

32:09.666 --> 32:13.708
I should warn you, if you come with me,
your lives may become more difficult.

32:13.791 --> 32:16.250
You may learn things
that you didn't want to know.

32:16.333 --> 32:20.291
I wouldn't blame you for wanting
to leave this beach with that banker.

32:20.375 --> 32:23.250
See? Even this strange, fertile woman
wants you to come with me.

32:23.333 --> 32:24.958
But you'll take us to V.F.D.?

32:25.041 --> 32:26.083
I promise.

32:32.750 --> 32:33.875
Goodbye, Mr. Poe.

32:35.916 --> 32:38.625
How did you find us?
With a little help from your friends.

32:38.708 --> 32:41.291
Fiona Widdershins sent
a Volunteer Factual Dispatch

32:41.375 --> 32:43.208
so that we knew you were on the  Queequeg.

32:43.291 --> 32:46.500
And Quigley Quagmire tracked your location
by studying tidal charts.

32:46.583 --> 32:47.416
Is he here?

32:47.708 --> 32:48.708
He wanted to be,

32:48.791 --> 32:51.958
but he got a lead on a certain
self-sustaining hot air mobile home

32:52.041 --> 32:53.333
He left to find his family.

32:54.166 --> 32:55.416
He thought you would understand.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.583
Baudelaires, you can't just go off
on your own!

32:58.875 --> 32:59.916
You're children!

33:00.666 --> 33:01.583
You're orphans!

33:04.291 --> 33:05.166
You're leaving.

33:11.875 --> 33:14.583
I was expecting this brig
to be full of suffering Baudelaires,

33:14.666 --> 33:16.833
but someone let them get away.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.833
I want you to think
about what you've done,

33:20.250 --> 33:22.250
and once you're good and sorry,

33:22.333 --> 33:25.666
I will tear you hook from hook.

33:26.958 --> 33:28.000
[door locks]

33:31.958 --> 33:33.833
We have to get out of here.
I know.

33:33.916 --> 33:36.375
And then we have to warn V.F.D.
about the Medusoid Mycelium.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.291
Why do we?

33:37.375 --> 33:40.416
And then we have to rescue
those Snow Scouts, defect from Count Olaf,

33:40.500 --> 33:43.291
and search for our stepfather
so we can be a family again.

33:43.791 --> 33:44.791
That sounds nice.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.166
But first we have to escape
from this brig.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.250
[rattling]

33:58.166 --> 34:00.833
They who hesitate are lost.

34:06.541 --> 34:07.375
[snapping]

34:08.041 --> 34:10.541
Our agents are already converging
on the Hotel Denouement,

34:10.625 --> 34:13.375
so we'll have to drive quickly.
Do you have any questions?

34:13.458 --> 34:14.416
Who are you?

34:14.500 --> 34:15.708
An excellent question.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.166
The name's Snicket.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.250
Kit Snicket.

34:28.416 --> 34:31.041
