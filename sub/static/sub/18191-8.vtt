00:00.988 --> 00:02.852
Previously on "Chasing Life"...

00:02.873 --> 00:05.169
- Who is this?
- That girl is our half-sister.

00:05.189 --> 00:07.498
- Her name is Natalie Ortiz.
- Does this mean that dad...

00:07.518 --> 00:09.450
- Had an affair.
- It's my body

00:09.470 --> 00:11.452
and if I wanna have a baby...

00:11.575 --> 00:14.025
- April you are my baby.
- I am an adult.

00:14.045 --> 00:16.872
- Your payment was already processed.
- But I haven't paid yet.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.596
Well, someone else did.
They asked to remain anonymous.

00:19.732 --> 00:21.896
Your gonna love me.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.640
What are you doing?
I have a boyfriend!

00:27.660 --> 00:28.846
So you wanna take a break?

00:28.971 --> 00:30.786
I have a lot of stuff to
figure out right now,

00:30.806 --> 00:34.755
and I think it's probably
better that I do that on my own.

00:40.993 --> 00:42.868
How do you like that trick, ladies?

00:42.888 --> 00:44.418
We really do make a great team.

00:44.438 --> 00:46.965
I am not sure what you just did,
but yeah, we do.

00:46.999 --> 00:49.019
I never win this much when pearl's here.

00:49.039 --> 00:51.282
Let's hope she needs a new hip every week.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.790
- Emma!
- Thanks for inviting me.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.936
If I wasn't down here,
I'd be up in my room

00:56.956 --> 00:58.391
Facebook-stalking Dominic.

00:58.411 --> 01:00.214
April's been seeing a boy who left

01:00.234 --> 01:01.935
to follow a band around Europe.

01:01.955 --> 01:04.405
Show them his picture.
That'll excite them.

01:05.711 --> 01:06.450
My God,

01:06.470 --> 01:08.564
- those dimples... whew.
- I know.

01:08.584 --> 01:10.703
Oh, he reminds me of Willie.

01:10.723 --> 01:11.996
My late husband.

01:12.016 --> 01:13.513
Oh, I'm sorry, Gertie.

01:13.533 --> 01:17.212
Oh, thank you, Bubbeleh. But he was old.

01:17.232 --> 01:18.195
It happens.

01:18.215 --> 01:20.072
You girls hear about Bonnie?

01:20.092 --> 01:23.392
- Croaked in her sleep last week.
- That's the way it go.

01:23.412 --> 01:24.805
Gertie: It's much better than a stroke.

01:24.825 --> 01:27.942
Especially if you have
someone lying next to you.

01:28.302 --> 01:30.906
Emma, I think I'm offending
your granddaughter.

01:30.926 --> 01:33.840
- Actually, I don't think it's the best...
- You know, it's okay.

01:33.860 --> 01:38.679
It's just you guys are so casual,
talking about death.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.974
Oh, honey, when you get to be our age
you're just used to it.

01:41.994 --> 01:43.690
You've said goodbye to so many people,

01:43.710 --> 01:46.461
it's just a part of the mishegas of life.

01:46.495 --> 01:50.449
I know, as a religious woman,
I'll be going to a better place.

01:50.469 --> 01:51.978
Emma: Religious? Since when?

01:51.998 --> 01:54.092
God knows not in
'57 when you were sleeping

01:54.112 --> 01:55.958
with all the Boston Celtics.

01:55.978 --> 01:58.131
It wasn't all the Celtics.

01:58.151 --> 01:59.687
Just a couple of forwards.

01:59.707 --> 02:00.892
(Laughs)

02:00.912 --> 02:04.025
I have no regrets for
having fun in my life.

02:04.045 --> 02:06.102
And if he, or she,

02:06.122 --> 02:07.861
doesn't want let people
like me into heaven,

02:07.881 --> 02:10.025
then I don't want to go there anyway.

02:10.044 --> 02:12.146
I'd rather go down there.

02:12.557 --> 02:14.576
Maybe that's where the party is.

02:14.596 --> 02:16.163
(Dottie laughs)

02:21.462 --> 02:23.321
Leo: Namaste.

02:23.497 --> 02:25.165
You never come to yoga nights.

02:25.199 --> 02:28.787
Yeah well,
I used to have plans on Thursday nights.

02:28.986 --> 02:31.975
Dominic and I would go to Trivia
at the pour house.

02:31.995 --> 02:34.445
Oh, so dimples left.

02:34.465 --> 02:36.075
Can you stop calling him that?

02:36.354 --> 02:37.561
Sorry.

02:39.013 --> 02:40.607
Look, I get it.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.081
Break-ups suck.

02:42.116 --> 02:44.884
So if you ever need to talk...

02:45.134 --> 02:46.788
I'm good. But thanks.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.196
Where is Jackson?

02:50.216 --> 02:52.335
He's the one that kept
telling me to come to this.

02:52.355 --> 02:54.792
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

02:55.078 --> 02:57.358
Jackson's back in the hospital.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.735
Chemo's not working.
Sounds like it's only a matter of time.

03:01.021 --> 03:02.862
How is that possible?

03:03.073 --> 03:05.000
Look around you.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.530
You're in a cancer support group.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.747
People don't always stick around.

03:10.555 --> 03:12.706
Sometimes we die.

03:44.843 --> 03:45.909
You going somewhere?

03:45.944 --> 03:48.017
Yeah, Miami with the Eco Club.

03:48.037 --> 03:50.243
We leave super early tomorrow.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.058
Since when are you in the eco club?

03:52.078 --> 03:55.018
Since... whatever.

03:55.714 --> 03:57.588
Is that girl in it or something?

03:57.622 --> 03:58.622
The one you loo-ve?

03:58.657 --> 04:00.824
I don't love her.

04:00.859 --> 04:02.793
But yeah, she's in it.

04:03.179 --> 04:05.231
I can't believe your
school's taking you to Miami.

04:05.251 --> 04:08.278
The only field trip we took
in high school was to Fenway.

04:08.298 --> 04:10.081
Hey, Ape?

04:10.101 --> 04:13.404
Did you know when you search
Natalie Ortiz on the Internet

04:13.438 --> 04:15.639
there are like a thousand
results that come up?

04:17.180 --> 04:18.809
I did know that, actually.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.644
What else do you know about her?

04:20.850 --> 04:23.238
Not much. Just that she lives near

04:23.258 --> 04:26.684
- where dad had his writing retreat.
- In Florida?

04:26.889 --> 04:30.158
Guess writing wasn't the only thing
he was doing there.

04:31.290 --> 04:32.690
(Footsteps)

04:32.894 --> 04:34.458
Morning, girls.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.827
Hey, brenna, are you packed for your trip?

04:36.861 --> 04:38.629
I'll finish when I get home from school.

04:38.663 --> 04:40.597
Don't forget you have to
be at the hospital by 3:00

04:40.632 --> 04:42.576
- to get your cheek swabbed.
- Hey, thanks for doing that.

04:42.596 --> 04:44.255
Yeah, of course.

04:44.275 --> 04:46.370
I'll swab my cheek for you anytime, girl.

04:50.983 --> 04:53.711
So how are you feeling?

04:54.241 --> 04:58.549
Okay. I mean, for a person
gearing up for chemo.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.914
And a fertility treatment before that.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.130
Which apparently someone already paid for.

05:05.212 --> 05:07.558
Wait, what? Someone paid for it?

05:08.303 --> 05:11.131
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought maybe you
had... never mind, no.

05:11.151 --> 05:13.397
April, it's not like I wouldn't have
paid for it.

05:13.431 --> 05:14.665
You know what, mom? You don't have to lie.

05:14.699 --> 05:16.311
I know you're not supportive of this.

05:16.331 --> 05:17.768
- I am.
- I have to go.

05:17.802 --> 05:19.473
I'll see you later.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.745
So once you've checked into mass medical,

05:27.779 --> 05:30.481
Dr. Hamburg will become
your primary doctor.

05:30.515 --> 05:32.349
And you're in very good hands.

05:32.384 --> 05:34.980
She's the top A.M.L.Specialist
in all of new England.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.920
It's true, I am.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.689
I hate cancer.

05:38.723 --> 05:40.624
I hate cancer so much I
made it my life's work

05:40.658 --> 05:41.958
to destroy it.

05:41.978 --> 05:43.935
And I know that our greatest chance

05:43.955 --> 05:47.156
of beating this is to
deal with it head-on.

05:47.176 --> 05:48.532
Just look it straight in the eye

05:48.566 --> 05:49.700
and kill the bastard.

05:49.734 --> 05:52.297
Let's do it. Um...

05:52.837 --> 05:55.773
So what's the plan? I do chemo,

05:55.807 --> 05:57.775
and then stay in the hospital for a month.

05:57.809 --> 06:00.236
And then get a bone marrow transplant?

06:00.256 --> 06:01.645
You may not need a transplant,

06:01.679 --> 06:04.021
but we prefer to have a donor on standby,

06:04.041 --> 06:06.550
ready to go.
So we're gonna test your family.

06:06.584 --> 06:10.172
Siblings are usually the best choice
for a full match.

06:10.192 --> 06:12.934
But if I do need the transplant,
it's really risky, right?

06:12.954 --> 06:15.122
Why don't we cross that
bridge when we come to it.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.594
I just found out a friend might die soon

06:17.629 --> 06:20.276
and I don't want that to happen.

06:20.296 --> 06:24.156
Okay, patient would like to not die.

06:24.379 --> 06:25.244
I got it.

06:25.245 --> 06:25.909
(Chuckles)

06:25.929 --> 06:28.914
April,
I am always gonna shoot straight with you.

06:28.934 --> 06:32.222
Yes,
there are risks if you have a transplant.

06:32.242 --> 06:36.010
There could be organ damage,
threats of infections...

06:36.030 --> 06:38.268
some people don't survive it.

06:38.288 --> 06:40.784
And if I don't do it?

06:40.819 --> 06:43.587
Well, there are gonna be risks
whatever choice you make.

06:43.621 --> 06:46.201
But I promise you, I will do everything

06:46.221 --> 06:48.253
I possibly can to keep you alive.

06:48.273 --> 06:50.378
I am not a quitter.

06:50.851 --> 06:52.654
I hope you're not either.

07:02.809 --> 07:04.508
All right, you really need to pack.

07:04.542 --> 07:05.609
In a minute.

07:05.643 --> 07:08.044
I'm not putting out
till that bag is packed.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.945
Isn't weird that I'm going to Florida

07:12.965 --> 07:15.619
like right after I find out
that I have a sister there?

07:15.653 --> 07:18.288
- Where does she live?
- Key Largo.

07:18.323 --> 07:20.791
It's like an hour away
from where we're gonna be.

07:20.811 --> 07:24.852
I found her address
after April told me where she lives.

07:25.213 --> 07:27.493
I could totally take a cab there.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.570
Brenna...

07:28.590 --> 07:30.739
Maybe I need to go find her.

07:30.759 --> 07:34.152
Maybe this is why the universe
wanted me to join Eco Club.

07:34.172 --> 07:36.173
No...
The universe wanted you to join

07:36.207 --> 07:39.748
the Eco Club because its president
is really hot.

07:39.768 --> 07:42.357
Seriously. Maybe this is why

07:42.377 --> 07:44.571
I'm just finding out about her now.

07:44.591 --> 07:47.232
If April needs a bone marrow transplant

07:47.252 --> 07:49.309
and I'm not a match,

07:49.329 --> 07:50.963
maybe this girl could be one.

07:50.983 --> 07:53.503
They say siblings are the best chance.

07:54.038 --> 07:56.443
All right, well,
if you're gonna go find her

07:56.463 --> 07:59.241
- I'll go with you.
- I can go alone.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.661
You, like, love ecology.

08:02.096 --> 08:05.125
(Chuckles) It sounds so nerdy
when you call it ecology.

08:05.145 --> 08:06.381
Yeah well...

08:06.401 --> 08:08.328
you're a nerd.

08:09.136 --> 08:11.001
Not so much of a nerd that
I won't break the rules

08:11.021 --> 08:13.097
every once in a while.

08:16.766 --> 08:18.370
(Typing)

08:27.961 --> 08:30.953
- Hey, Raquel, how are you?
- Yeah, you too, Donny.

08:30.973 --> 08:33.142
How's that summation coming along?

08:33.162 --> 08:36.089
Last time I checked you
weren't my supervisor anymore.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.845
Last time I checked I'm
still your superior.

08:38.865 --> 08:40.193
So?

08:40.905 --> 08:43.897
In summation... it's really tedious.

08:43.932 --> 08:45.693
Well...
Hang in there.

08:45.713 --> 08:47.658
If you need me, I'll be in my office.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.253
- Man, I'd love to be in her...
- Danny, no.

08:53.273 --> 08:55.609
I was just gonna say office.

08:59.197 --> 09:01.448
April: What does it feel like?

09:01.483 --> 09:03.717
Do you actually see light?

09:03.955 --> 09:06.653
Or does everything just go dark?

09:06.965 --> 09:08.661
Maybe it's neither.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.849
Maybe you just kind of...

09:10.869 --> 09:12.125
fade away.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.327
I don't know.

09:13.361 --> 09:15.948
Jackson's here.
I guess he got better.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.759
Um, did you just see that?

09:21.545 --> 09:22.905
Wait, Meg, where are you...

09:22.925 --> 09:25.300
Dominic? What are you doing here?

09:27.451 --> 09:29.471
Leo, where is everyone going?

09:29.491 --> 09:31.879
Don't be naive, April.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.080
You know the answer already.

09:35.497 --> 09:36.878
(Gasps)

09:43.319 --> 09:44.991
Sara: I'm glad you're getting away.

09:45.011 --> 09:46.470
It'll take your mind off
the stress around here

09:46.490 --> 09:49.062
- for a little while.
- Yeah, you too.

09:49.082 --> 09:51.382
Have a fun sailing trip.

09:51.402 --> 09:53.619
It's not really a trip,
just a couple hours on the boat

09:53.653 --> 09:55.240
with the caregivers group.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.299
It doesn't exactly sound
like a break from the stress.

09:58.319 --> 10:01.527
Sitting around crying with other parents
about your sick kids?

10:01.561 --> 10:03.662
Believe me,
that's the last thing this group does.

10:03.697 --> 10:06.499
I'm getting the sense their
meetups are mostly about drinking.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.334
- Now you're talking.
- (Laughs)

10:08.368 --> 10:10.722
- I'm kidding.
- (Car honks)

10:10.742 --> 10:12.538
There's your van.

10:13.055 --> 10:15.794
Have a great time in Florida...
and be safe.

10:22.907 --> 10:24.715
Hey, what do you think it was
about that place

10:24.735 --> 10:26.472
that dad loved so much?

10:27.665 --> 10:29.357
I don't know.

10:29.481 --> 10:31.769
Maybe you'll get an idea
when you're down there.

10:32.851 --> 10:34.393
Bye.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.225
Ring ring. "Hey, Dominic, it's April.

10:41.245 --> 10:43.339
What's up? I have cancer."

10:43.359 --> 10:45.384
He'll be back in Boston in five hours,
done and done.

10:45.404 --> 10:47.770
- I can't do that to him, Beth.
- Can't you though?

10:47.790 --> 10:49.697
All you do is talk about
how much you miss him.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.824
I do, but...

10:51.844 --> 10:53.627
It just wouldn't be right.

10:53.647 --> 10:56.781
He's doing his dream job,

10:56.815 --> 10:59.017
while I am doing a nightmare assignment.

10:59.051 --> 11:01.919
Dude, play hooky. You've only got a
few more days till you start chemo.

11:01.954 --> 11:02.954
Exactly.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.689
I only have a few more days

11:04.723 --> 11:06.958
until my entire life changes.

11:07.344 --> 11:10.221
I have to keep things as
normal as I can until then.

11:10.241 --> 11:12.463
Oh, but that's so much less fun for me.

11:12.498 --> 11:15.215
Oh, you want something fun
to do in the next two days?

11:15.235 --> 11:17.612
Find out who paid for
me to freeze my eggs.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.129
Do you think it could be George?

11:19.149 --> 11:21.964
Mmm. My Uncle paid for
my fertility treatment?

11:21.984 --> 11:23.158
Sounds like a reality show.

11:23.178 --> 11:25.496
A reality show I'd totally watch.

11:25.516 --> 11:26.640
Look, whoever it is is a saint.

11:26.660 --> 11:29.021
It's like they're giving you
free babies or something.

11:29.041 --> 11:30.898
Speaking of babies,
how many are you planning to have

11:30.918 --> 11:32.117
with your new lover Graham?

11:32.137 --> 11:34.069
Oh my God. Stop it.

11:34.089 --> 11:36.390
I still never got the details.

11:36.763 --> 11:40.265
Let's just say there's an upside
to sleeping with a perfectionist.

11:42.026 --> 11:42.993
But, no...

11:42.994 --> 11:45.028
There are a lot of downsides...

11:45.063 --> 11:47.030
like the fact that he
smells like kombucha,

11:47.065 --> 11:48.866
and I'll always have to use tissues

11:48.900 --> 11:50.801
instead of toilet paper in that bathroom.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.456
Those guys are always
running out of toilet paper.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.941
(Vacuum running)

12:11.122 --> 12:12.431
What is going on?

12:12.451 --> 12:13.923
Pipe burst last night,

12:13.958 --> 12:15.759
bullpen is flooded.

12:15.793 --> 12:18.258
Luckily my office escaped the mess.

12:18.482 --> 12:20.697
It's a little higher up
than everyone else's.

12:20.731 --> 12:22.347
Hm, I don't think so.

12:27.672 --> 12:28.905
Everyone...

12:29.174 --> 12:30.940
Meet in front of the Hansen ballroom

12:30.975 --> 12:33.743
at 6:00 P.M. sharp for the conference.

12:33.778 --> 12:35.578
You'll sign in with...

12:35.613 --> 12:38.415
Annie, our club secretary.

12:41.712 --> 12:44.174
How's the keynote address coming,
Mr. Ostrowsky?

12:44.298 --> 12:46.007
(Stammers)

12:46.027 --> 12:47.897
When I was running for class president,

12:47.917 --> 12:50.682
it really helped to rehearse my speech
in front of the mirror.

12:50.702 --> 12:53.128
Well, clearly it worked for you,

12:53.148 --> 12:55.075
Ms. President.

12:55.312 --> 12:57.612
Good... good advice.

13:01.728 --> 13:03.956
Okay, Annie said she'll sign us in later.

13:03.976 --> 13:05.361
Let's get a cab.

13:05.381 --> 13:08.377
You really think Mr. Ostrowsky's
not going to notice?

13:08.397 --> 13:10.149
He can barely speak in
front of 20 students

13:10.169 --> 13:11.714
in environmental science,

13:11.748 --> 13:13.382
he's gonna be a mess tonight.

13:13.603 --> 13:14.777
(Laughing)

13:14.797 --> 13:16.824
You ready?

13:33.202 --> 13:34.803
- Hey.
- Hey...

13:34.837 --> 13:35.804
Join the party.

13:35.805 --> 13:36.905
Oh, April...

13:36.939 --> 13:38.874
There's no plants or
flowers in the cancer ward,

13:38.908 --> 13:41.910
'cause the bacteria can mess with
the patient's immune systems.

13:41.944 --> 13:42.978
Oh, um...

13:43.012 --> 13:45.614
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

13:47.531 --> 13:48.917
(Laughs nervously)

13:48.951 --> 13:52.194
I'm way past the point where
some plant will do me in.

13:52.505 --> 13:54.213
How are you feeling?

13:54.233 --> 13:57.550
Good. I'm dying a little, but good.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.621
I'm sorry, that wasn't the
right thing...

13:59.641 --> 14:03.402
No no, it's me.
Being blunt is just my coping mechanism.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.125
So it's a beautiful day out, huh?

14:07.494 --> 14:09.337
I wish people had told me
how much I was gonna miss

14:09.372 --> 14:11.615
being outside before I checked in.

14:11.635 --> 14:16.186
It's like you're trapped indoors,
breathing this hospital air.

14:16.584 --> 14:19.424
Never feeling the wind or...

14:19.444 --> 14:21.384
smelling the rain or anything.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.517
It's just sad.

14:24.977 --> 14:26.835
I should have gotten out more first.

14:26.855 --> 14:27.956
(Knocks)

14:29.148 --> 14:32.115
- Cannolis, anyone?
- Oh, hell yeah.

14:37.338 --> 14:39.415
Mmm, God.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.653
Will you please make sure they
serve these at my funeral?

14:42.673 --> 14:45.434
Actually, don't.
If I can't be there to enjoy this,

14:45.468 --> 14:47.236
I need everyone else to suffer.

14:47.270 --> 14:49.371
Oh, you've always been so selfless.

14:49.406 --> 14:51.307
Hey, man, it's my funeral.

14:52.617 --> 14:53.909
Doesn't it suck

14:53.944 --> 14:55.844
that you can't go to your own funeral?

14:55.879 --> 14:58.113
I mean,
it's basically a party in your honor

14:58.148 --> 14:59.982
and you don't even get to go.

15:00.016 --> 15:02.306
I mean,
you don't even get to pick the playlist.

15:02.326 --> 15:04.620
Oh, F.Y.I. guys,
please make sure they play

15:04.654 --> 15:05.821
Daniel powter's "bad day."

15:05.855 --> 15:07.623
Meg: Way to be literal, Jackson.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.825
Well, I should head back to the office.

15:09.859 --> 15:11.527
Hey, you wanna hang out later, April?

15:11.561 --> 15:13.434
Leo and I have some fun stuff planned.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.531
- Rude.
- Sorry.

15:15.565 --> 15:18.204
Um, I can't really skip work, but thanks.

15:18.966 --> 15:20.799
I'll see you later, Jackson.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.609
Mmm... maybe.

15:22.734 --> 15:25.300
If I haven't died from a
fatal plant infection first.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.730
- Dude.
- Sorry.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.305
Coping mechanism.

15:33.070 --> 15:34.574
(Vacuums running)

15:36.129 --> 15:38.330
Danny: How's the boring article coming?

15:39.001 --> 15:40.119
What?

15:40.139 --> 15:43.813
Sorry, I can't hear you
over the soul-sucking sounds of vacuums.

15:43.833 --> 15:44.126
(Vacuum stops)

15:45.549 --> 15:48.173
This would never happen at
"The New York Times."

15:48.932 --> 15:50.899
So how's the boring article coming?

15:50.934 --> 15:53.772
- Speaking of soul-sucking...
- (Chuckles)

15:54.145 --> 15:55.804
(Bag rustles)

15:58.224 --> 16:00.126
(Chewing loudly)

16:02.675 --> 16:04.013
(Vacuum running)

16:09.551 --> 16:11.006
(Loud office chatter)

16:14.541 --> 16:16.493
What am I doing here?

16:22.995 --> 16:25.783
Yeah, exactly.
I know... excuse me. (Clears throat)

16:25.803 --> 16:28.280
- I'm on the phone.
- I'm sick, I'm leaving.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.549
You look healthy to me.

16:29.569 --> 16:32.284
Well, I'm not. And I have a ton
of sick days I haven't used yet.

16:32.421 --> 16:34.249
So I'm going to take
one of them right now.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.525
Enjoy your dry office.

16:39.049 --> 16:41.268
You are such a badass.

16:41.288 --> 16:43.468
I've never taken a sick day in my life.

16:43.488 --> 16:45.956
Well, as someone who basically
takes a sick day every day,

16:45.990 --> 16:48.748
I'm used to this feeling.
It's liberating, right?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.886
And it's also one of your
last days of freedom.

16:51.906 --> 16:53.847
So what should we do?

16:53.867 --> 16:55.223
Hmm...

16:55.695 --> 16:57.386
I have an idea.

16:58.636 --> 17:00.036
(Phone dialing)

17:02.094 --> 17:03.728
Hey, Leo?

17:03.763 --> 17:04.796
Where are you?

17:04.830 --> 17:07.094
Meg said you had some fun stuff planned.

17:07.516 --> 17:09.991
(Hard rock music playing)

17:13.606 --> 17:15.071
This is the right address?

17:16.266 --> 17:18.031
I'm sure it is.

17:22.348 --> 17:24.415
Welcome to the Velvet Lounge.

17:24.450 --> 17:27.068
Take a seat, absorb the deluxe decor.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.871
Oh, I don't think we'll be staying.

17:28.891 --> 17:29.965
Think again, cancer friend,

17:29.985 --> 17:32.071
because something really
awesome is about to happen.

17:32.091 --> 17:33.992
Uh, Mindy,
can we get another round of wings

17:34.026 --> 17:35.960
for my friends here? Thank you.

17:35.995 --> 17:38.830
Of course Leo Hendrie
eats lunch at strip clubs

17:38.864 --> 17:40.898
and is on a first-name
basis with the strippers.

17:40.933 --> 17:42.567
Actually, April,

17:42.601 --> 17:44.469
you're on a first-name basis
with one of 'em.

17:44.503 --> 17:46.437
What are you talking about?

17:46.472 --> 17:47.839
Dj: And now, the Velvet Lounge presents

17:47.873 --> 17:50.408
first-time dancer Meg.

17:50.442 --> 17:52.377
(Cheering)

18:00.219 --> 18:03.054
I told you something really
awesome was about to happen.

18:03.088 --> 18:06.090
- Man: Come on, you got it, girl!
- (Rock music playing)

18:11.002 --> 18:12.843
Man 2: What are you waiting for?

18:14.086 --> 18:15.914
When's she gonna get naked?

18:19.276 --> 18:21.738
Go, Meg! Woo! Yeah!

18:22.384 --> 18:24.436
(Cheering)

18:32.909 --> 18:34.500
April: Go, Meg!

18:46.835 --> 18:49.614
Here you go, if you want this... but now,

18:49.634 --> 18:51.875
you've gotta work for it.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.871
(Crowd gasps)

19:06.891 --> 19:08.719
Hey!

19:11.179 --> 19:12.821
Now that's what I call taking it all off.

19:14.972 --> 19:16.307
Woo-oo!

19:16.327 --> 19:18.409
Thank you so much for including me.

19:18.443 --> 19:20.726
Of course.
I'm glad we didn't scare you off

19:20.746 --> 19:22.006
after last time.

19:22.026 --> 19:24.481
Dr. Carver mentioned
that you were expecting

19:24.501 --> 19:26.471
a more traditional support group.

19:26.491 --> 19:28.560
And traditional we are not.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.211
(Laughing) Well,
I'm grateful for that actually.

19:30.231 --> 19:34.178
This is exactly what I need, outing
reckon not thinking

19:34.198 --> 19:35.989
about cancer for one day.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.159
Hey, Liz, where do you keep the ice?

19:39.732 --> 19:41.195
George?

19:41.229 --> 19:42.704
Sara?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.880
What are you doing here?

19:44.900 --> 19:48.035
Well, isn't this for the support group?

19:48.070 --> 19:50.771
I didn't think the group was your thing,
after last time.

19:50.806 --> 19:51.872
Liz: I'm sorry.

19:51.907 --> 19:53.841
I assumed you knew the other was coming.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.047
Aren't you brother and sister-in-law?

19:59.271 --> 20:01.649
Well,
I'm just glad we convinced you to join us.

20:01.683 --> 20:03.784
So many of us owe our
children's lives to him.

20:03.819 --> 20:05.451
Oh, come on.

20:07.489 --> 20:08.722
It's true.

20:10.265 --> 20:11.759
Well... (Laughs)

20:11.793 --> 20:15.496
Here's to taking the day off from...

20:15.530 --> 20:16.530
everything.

20:16.531 --> 20:18.332
- (Laughs)
- Okay, come on.

20:19.501 --> 20:21.469
That stage will never be the same.

20:21.503 --> 20:23.304
Meg: Thank you...

20:23.338 --> 20:24.472
so much, Leo.

20:24.506 --> 20:26.273
Wait, you planned all this?

20:26.308 --> 20:29.443
Let's just say my dad has a
few connections to this place.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.974
And so when Meg said it was
a lifelong dream of hers...

20:31.994 --> 20:33.280
Meg: Not lifelong.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.483
Just since "showgirls."

20:35.517 --> 20:37.051
I blame Nomi Malone.

20:37.085 --> 20:38.219
Right there with you.

20:38.253 --> 20:41.190
Although I'm more of a
Cristal Conrs myself.

20:42.048 --> 20:45.759
Ever since I lost my hair,
I've just felt so...

20:45.779 --> 20:46.894
Invisible to guys.

20:46.928 --> 20:50.058
And now, i definitely don't.

20:50.078 --> 20:53.216
I feel hot and kind of slutty.

20:53.236 --> 20:55.674
You'll always be a slut to me, Meg.

20:56.146 --> 20:58.427
Leo is like the patron Saint of the group.

20:58.447 --> 21:00.013
Stop, please.

21:00.138 --> 21:01.507
You never got to meet Chris,

21:01.527 --> 21:03.713
but he took Chris to Iceland
because he wanted to see

21:03.733 --> 21:06.237
the northern lights before he died.

21:06.257 --> 21:09.665
Just a few weeks ago he took
Alan out on his dad's boat.

21:11.138 --> 21:13.534
- April: Leo?
- Hmm?

21:13.554 --> 21:15.739
Did you pay for my fertility treatment?

21:16.075 --> 21:18.658
Eww, fertility? Gross.

21:18.692 --> 21:19.759
Eggs, ugh.

21:19.793 --> 21:20.793
Thank you.

21:20.828 --> 21:22.328
Pffft!

21:22.363 --> 21:24.564
Now I have one more mission for us.

21:24.598 --> 21:27.367
But I gotta say it first, this mission

21:27.401 --> 21:31.371
involves... possibly getting into trouble

21:31.405 --> 21:34.432
and maybe breaking a law or two.

21:36.377 --> 21:38.821
Let's do it. Let's go.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.480
(All laugh)

21:41.097 --> 21:42.282
Who is this person?

21:42.316 --> 21:45.256
- Beth: I know, wow.
- All right.

21:57.921 --> 22:00.122
You can do this, Brenna.

22:11.989 --> 22:14.277
Well, I guess she's not home so...

22:19.808 --> 22:21.064
(Clears throat)

22:21.263 --> 22:22.954
Hi, I'm Brenna.

22:24.347 --> 22:25.811
Carver?

22:27.005 --> 22:28.751
So, um...

22:29.585 --> 22:31.520
You probably already know this,

22:31.554 --> 22:35.223
but it turns out we have the same dad.

22:35.258 --> 22:39.187
I know. And I'm sorry that
you came all the way down here

22:39.207 --> 22:41.806
for me to tell you that I
want nothing to do with you.

22:43.025 --> 22:44.466
Or your family.

22:45.611 --> 22:47.581
You probably should have called first.

22:47.601 --> 22:49.031
(Door slams)

23:04.489 --> 23:06.038
(Clears throat)

23:06.072 --> 23:07.626
Hey, go ahead.
We'll meet you at Meg's car.

23:07.646 --> 23:09.081
Okay. (Giggling)

23:09.504 --> 23:11.991
Hey, where are you going?

23:12.513 --> 23:14.880
- Patients can't just leave.
- Don't worry, Marion.

23:14.914 --> 23:16.748
I'll have him back in a couple hours.
Love you!

23:16.783 --> 23:18.463
(Sighs)

23:20.019 --> 23:22.392
Okay, how long is the wait for a cab?

23:22.412 --> 23:24.506
We can't give up so easily.

23:24.526 --> 23:28.414
What are we supposed to do?
I can't force her to talk to me.

23:28.434 --> 23:30.609
Hi, yes, I'm here.

23:30.644 --> 23:32.478
Two hours?

23:32.512 --> 23:34.847
Yeah, we're forcing her to talk to you.

23:34.881 --> 23:39.047
- Will you just talk to us for a minute?
- I thought I told you that I...

23:39.067 --> 23:41.420
- Natalie, please.
- Who do you think you are,

23:41.455 --> 23:43.689
just showing up at my house
out of nowhere like this?

23:43.724 --> 23:46.794
I'm sorry if it sucked finding
out your dad had a secret kid.

23:46.814 --> 23:48.766
Did you think for a second what it must
have been like for me,

23:48.786 --> 23:50.942
being the secret kid?

23:51.398 --> 23:53.820
- I'm sorry, I hadn't thought...
- Well, maybe you should have,

23:53.840 --> 23:56.176
before you flew all the way down here.

23:56.860 --> 24:01.340
Look, coming here might have been
a really impulsive thing to do.

24:01.618 --> 24:03.973
But I came with good intentions,

24:03.993 --> 24:05.444
I swear.

24:06.777 --> 24:10.082
Things have been really
crazy with my family lately.

24:10.544 --> 24:13.571
- Mostly with my older sister April.
- Oh, right.

24:13.591 --> 24:16.147
That freak who chased
me through the cemetery.

24:16.167 --> 24:17.540
I recognized her.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.177
It's not like I hadn't
looked you guys up years ago.

24:20.749 --> 24:23.845
Seems like you lead pretty perfect lives.

24:25.474 --> 24:27.954
Actually April has cancer.

24:27.974 --> 24:31.427
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.730
That must be hard.

24:36.065 --> 24:38.801
That's kind of why that...
must bi came down here.

24:39.435 --> 24:42.084
I wanted to meet my other sister.

24:42.104 --> 24:44.131
Aren't you curious too?

24:47.737 --> 24:51.160
Fine, let's get to know each other.

24:56.355 --> 24:58.260
You guys coming or what?

25:01.530 --> 25:02.993
April: What are we doing here?

25:03.028 --> 25:04.929
Jackson: Having a funeral.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.831
If everyone can please
make their way inside,

25:06.865 --> 25:08.899
- we'll begin shortly.
- You heard him.

25:08.934 --> 25:10.944
Dude wanted to see his funeral.

25:12.454 --> 25:14.572
Okay, this is weird.

25:14.606 --> 25:15.673
Do you want to leave?

25:15.707 --> 25:17.475
Come on, gals.

25:17.509 --> 25:19.207
Let's funeral down.

25:30.422 --> 25:31.455
Another round, please? Thank you.

25:31.490 --> 25:32.940
Hey, yo.

25:33.338 --> 25:35.392
I saw you trying to move
in there for a while,

25:35.427 --> 25:36.862
- so here you go.
- Thank you.

25:36.882 --> 25:38.629
It's been a long time
since I waited in line

25:38.663 --> 25:41.265
- at a crowded bar.
- That's probably a good thing.

25:41.299 --> 25:43.234
- That was fun on the boat...
- George?

25:43.268 --> 25:45.336
- I thought that was you.
- Carrie...

25:45.370 --> 25:46.794
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:48.796 --> 25:52.309
Carrie Rosen, this is Sara Carver.

25:52.626 --> 25:54.851
You got married? Wow.

25:54.871 --> 25:57.363
No, I'm his sister-in-law.

25:57.383 --> 26:00.235
Oh, I was gonna say, did hell freeze over?

26:00.255 --> 26:03.282
- George carver a married man?
- So how's M.I.T.?

26:03.302 --> 26:04.730
I just got tenure.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.284
Wow, congratulations. That's fantastic.

26:07.304 --> 26:10.462
Carrie's a professor...
astrophysics.

26:10.795 --> 26:12.258
And I should get back to my colleagues.

26:12.278 --> 26:14.698
- It was nice meeting you, Sara.
- Nice meeting you.

26:14.718 --> 26:17.441
- And good to see you, George.
- You too.

26:21.505 --> 26:23.506
She seems nice, how do you know her?

26:23.541 --> 26:25.308
Carrie and I used to date.

26:26.644 --> 26:28.052
Oh...

26:29.547 --> 26:32.349
She's pretty and smart, what happened?

26:32.383 --> 26:34.117
She was the woman I was seeing

26:34.151 --> 26:35.951
when Thomas died, so...

26:46.690 --> 26:48.568
I'm really gonna miss you, man.

26:50.433 --> 26:51.776
That's all you got?

26:52.871 --> 26:55.972
I'm dead,
you're literally never gonna see me again.

26:56.007 --> 26:58.608
Can you at least try
to dig a little deeper?

26:59.056 --> 27:01.866
I don't know how deep this is, but...

27:02.774 --> 27:05.614
I love watching
"Vanderpump Rules" with you.

27:05.634 --> 27:07.179
(Jackson laughs)

27:07.199 --> 27:11.445
I mean, every single week I
look forward to doing that.

27:11.465 --> 27:14.549
I never laugh that hard
with anyone else...

27:14.959 --> 27:16.660
ever.

27:16.694 --> 27:21.236
And when I think about how we won't
have that time together again...

27:22.641 --> 27:24.170
it sucks.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.558
It really really sucks.

27:27.043 --> 27:30.704
I just wish we could rewind life

27:30.724 --> 27:32.315
or something,

27:32.987 --> 27:35.449
so that we could keep having
those Monday nights together,

27:35.922 --> 27:37.414
over and over,

27:38.446 --> 27:40.282
forever.

27:40.781 --> 27:42.969
Now that's what I'm talking about.

27:43.218 --> 27:44.822
I love you, Adam.

27:51.573 --> 27:52.779
(Sighs heavily)

27:52.916 --> 27:54.222
Okay, um...

27:54.242 --> 27:55.901
Who's next?

28:08.081 --> 28:09.362
Grandma?

28:10.155 --> 28:12.610
No, this can't happen yet.
(Breathing heavily)

28:12.630 --> 28:16.323
It's too soon.
Please please...

28:24.256 --> 28:27.234
Did somebody say Mai Tais?

28:27.254 --> 28:29.673
- Thanks, Natalie.
- It's on my mom.

28:29.693 --> 28:31.427
I figured she wouldn't
mind me using her card

28:31.462 --> 28:33.496
for a little family reunion.

28:33.530 --> 28:35.765
My mom would,
she doesn't even know that I'm here.

28:35.799 --> 28:36.799
Really?

28:36.834 --> 28:38.301
You're hardcore.

28:38.335 --> 28:40.737
Yeah, she'd freak out if she knew.

28:40.771 --> 28:42.672
She's pretty uptight.

28:42.706 --> 28:44.574
So are you and your mom close?

28:44.608 --> 28:47.243
Very. I mean, we kind of had to be

28:47.278 --> 28:49.145
since it was just the two of us.

28:50.414 --> 28:51.547
Why are we talking about our moms,

28:51.582 --> 28:53.483
when we have delicious
drinks in front of us?

28:53.517 --> 28:54.475
(Laughs)

28:54.495 --> 28:56.613
Cheers, bitches.

28:59.896 --> 29:03.164
- Are you two lesbians?
- I am.

29:03.166 --> 29:04.232
Uh...

29:04.266 --> 29:06.150
Let's dance.

29:07.602 --> 29:09.442
Come on.

29:14.244 --> 29:17.178
Leo: As some of us partake
in Jackson's complimentary

29:17.213 --> 29:19.355
medicinal marijuana,

29:19.691 --> 29:21.574
it'sime for the man of the hour

29:21.594 --> 29:23.688
to say a few words.

29:30.428 --> 29:33.761
Thank you all so much for coming today.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.054
As weird as it sounds,
this has seriously been

29:36.074 --> 29:37.952
the best day of my life.

29:38.126 --> 29:40.948
Getting to see all of you
for what could be...

29:43.375 --> 29:46.054
You know what?
I'm not gonna say the last time.

29:46.074 --> 29:49.672
Because I believe that
we'll all meet up again,

29:49.692 --> 29:52.009
somewhere sometime.

29:52.029 --> 29:54.882
Maybe in heaven, maybe in another life,

29:54.916 --> 29:59.197
I don't know for sure. But what I do know,

30:00.216 --> 30:03.954
is I've loved the time that I
had with all of you in this life.

30:04.924 --> 30:06.533
You made it fun.

30:06.553 --> 30:09.040
You made it worth living.

30:09.562 --> 30:11.520
Especially after I got sick

30:11.540 --> 30:13.012
and all I wanted to do was give up

30:13.032 --> 30:16.704
because this cancer was kicking my ass.

30:17.319 --> 30:19.396
You guys made me fight.

30:20.092 --> 30:21.883
And I did.

30:22.293 --> 30:25.985
And even though it looks
like I'm probably gonna lose,

30:26.905 --> 30:30.872
I think it's fair to say
that I played the game the whole time.

30:31.344 --> 30:34.341
And the best part is

30:34.615 --> 30:37.038
I got to play with all of you.

30:39.674 --> 30:41.432
I might need a hit of that joint.
(Chuckles)

30:41.452 --> 30:43.392
(Light laughter)

30:44.822 --> 30:47.425
I'm not sure what happens next for me.

30:48.109 --> 30:52.574
But after today, I'm at peace
with whatever that might be.

30:59.980 --> 31:01.595
We love you, Jackson.

31:02.763 --> 31:04.598
And to conclude...

31:05.052 --> 31:06.526
a surprise performance

31:06.546 --> 31:10.304

(Dance music playing)

32:23.205 --> 32:25.710
- Greer, what's wrong?
- I do not feel well.

32:25.730 --> 32:27.739
Hey, can we get some water, please?

32:30.052 --> 32:31.420
Here.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.729
Greer can barely stand.
She was fine a second ago

32:37.749 --> 32:39.522
and now she's, like, wasted.

32:39.542 --> 32:42.892
That sucks,
maybe you should dump the lightweight.

32:42.912 --> 32:46.244
I don't think she's drunk.
Did you put something in her drink?

32:46.369 --> 32:47.981
You think I drugged her?

32:48.016 --> 32:49.716
Wow.

32:49.751 --> 32:51.182
I should have known you
rich new-England girls

32:51.202 --> 32:53.060
would have found some
way to look down on us.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.211
I don't think coming here was a good idea.

32:55.231 --> 32:57.491
What, did you think it was gonna be some

32:57.525 --> 32:59.393
heartfelt, tearful reunion?

32:59.427 --> 33:00.594
(Laughs)

33:00.628 --> 33:01.785
You and me,

33:01.805 --> 33:05.399
we've got nothing in common except
the fact that we share a dad.

33:05.433 --> 33:07.434
Not that he was even in my life that much.

33:07.468 --> 33:09.636
I was a part-time kid.

33:09.671 --> 33:12.920
You and April were always gonna be
the only daughters who really got him.

33:12.940 --> 33:15.456
Look, I didn't come here
to find a new best friend.

33:15.476 --> 33:18.939
I already have one...
my sister April.

33:19.956 --> 33:22.149
I was gonna ask if you would get tested

33:22.183 --> 33:24.217
to be a possible bone
marrow donor for her.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.353
But now that I've met you,

33:26.387 --> 33:29.056
I realize you are way too selfish

33:29.090 --> 33:31.116
to ever do anything like that.

33:32.074 --> 33:33.864
Well, you got one thing right.

33:35.767 --> 33:37.397
How's Sara doing, by the way?

33:37.432 --> 33:39.366
I haven't seen her in a while.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.520
Oh, you didn't know your mom
knew about me?

33:43.951 --> 33:46.276
Well, we've met.

33:46.296 --> 33:49.136
Guess your family's not
as perfect as you thought.

33:50.131 --> 33:52.158
One point for the bastard.

33:59.992 --> 34:02.990
I mean, Carrie understood
where I was coming from, but...

34:03.762 --> 34:06.093
I wasn't...

34:06.127 --> 34:08.902
I wasn't in a place
to start a new relationship.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.042
You know, after what had happened.

34:11.062 --> 34:14.420
These past couple of years have been...

34:14.943 --> 34:16.092
Believe me, I know.

34:16.112 --> 34:17.670
(Chuckles)

34:20.378 --> 34:21.675
I'm so sorry, Sara.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.431
For what?

34:27.851 --> 34:30.484
Well, I mean, I was driving.

34:31.943 --> 34:35.062
George, it was an accident.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.331
I know, but I...

34:39.351 --> 34:40.699
you always blamed me.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.864
No, I didn't.

34:42.884 --> 34:44.349
Not for that.

34:45.157 --> 34:46.985
It's just...

34:49.982 --> 34:53.029
I find out about the affair and Natalie

34:54.466 --> 34:56.257
and I was hurt.

34:56.754 --> 34:59.415
And the fact that you had
both kept it from me...

35:01.604 --> 35:04.593
Especially... I mean,
you and I go way back,

35:04.613 --> 35:06.801
even before I met Thomas.

35:08.007 --> 35:09.189
(Sighs) Yeah.

35:11.328 --> 35:13.350
I don't blame you.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.735
I mean that sincerely.

35:18.668 --> 35:20.826
I appreciate that.

35:21.637 --> 35:24.450
Still doesn't change the
fact that I blame myself.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.341
Don't do that, George.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.543
You cannot keep carrying
that weight around.

35:28.577 --> 35:30.536
It'll crush you.

35:43.325 --> 35:46.161
Some fries and a milkshake!

35:46.195 --> 35:47.462
There's a diner down the street.

35:47.496 --> 35:49.164
Sweet. You guys coming?

35:49.198 --> 35:51.099
Uh, no, I've got to stay and clean up.

35:51.133 --> 35:53.268
I promised the guy who runs the place.

35:53.302 --> 35:54.469
Uh, I'm gonna help.

35:54.503 --> 35:56.318
All right.

36:01.177 --> 36:04.526
So tonight ended up being nice.

36:04.874 --> 36:07.577
Good,
I'm glad you were able to enjoy yourself.

36:07.597 --> 36:10.885
Enjoy is a strong word, but it was amazing

36:10.920 --> 36:13.586
to see Jackson so happy.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.530
And everyone else.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.792
It's like, everyone can be comfortable

36:17.827 --> 36:20.074
saying goodbye to him now.

36:20.297 --> 36:22.585
- That was the plan.
- Hey...

36:24.734 --> 36:27.746
You're not as much of an
ass as you pretend to be.

36:28.940 --> 36:30.264
Damn it.

36:30.284 --> 36:31.740
The secret's out.

36:32.253 --> 36:34.094
Thank you for helping me

36:34.529 --> 36:36.469
with everything.

36:39.801 --> 36:42.550
Helping people like this...

36:43.431 --> 36:45.433
It's the best thing that
could have happened to me.

36:46.217 --> 36:48.343
It gives me something, you know?

36:48.654 --> 36:50.238
A legacy.

36:50.984 --> 36:57.500
When I die I won't just be Bruce
Hendrie's dead rich-kid son. I'll be...

36:57.520 --> 36:59.639
the guy that...

36:59.920 --> 37:02.661
got to make people happy
befor the time ran out.

37:02.681 --> 37:05.272
And a guy...

37:05.292 --> 37:08.252
that helped people realizing
the most important thing in life.

37:08.724 --> 37:11.423
To leave this world with no regrets.

37:25.848 --> 37:27.365
(Sighs)

37:59.959 --> 38:01.405
So I have a question.

38:01.425 --> 38:02.360
Mm-hmm.

38:02.361 --> 38:04.803
Who's gonna grant your last wish?

38:05.313 --> 38:07.576
Oooh. Who's to say it wasn't just you?

38:10.102 --> 38:11.841
(Sighs)

38:12.314 --> 38:15.601
You know, it's been really hard

38:16.247 --> 38:18.910
for me to accept people being so casual

38:18.944 --> 38:21.545
and direct about death.

38:22.390 --> 38:23.848
How do you...

38:23.883 --> 38:27.645
I mean... You're terminal.

38:28.727 --> 38:30.331
Wait, what?

38:32.656 --> 38:34.310
Are you scared?

38:34.671 --> 38:37.211
If I let myself go to that place,

38:37.231 --> 38:38.972
I...

38:40.266 --> 38:42.901
It's just not a place I like to go to.

38:43.462 --> 38:45.837
I hadn't let myself go
there till recently.

38:45.961 --> 38:49.430
And now I just feel like
death is everywhere,

38:49.450 --> 38:51.609
it's inescapable.

38:51.838 --> 38:53.173
It's like the cancer might kill me

38:53.193 --> 38:56.265
or the bone marrow
transplant might kill me.

38:56.389 --> 38:58.516
Everything just feels so risky.

38:58.811 --> 39:01.452
It's like I'm damned if I do,
damned if I don't.

39:01.472 --> 39:03.441
I totally get that.

39:03.461 --> 39:05.866
It's the reason why I'm
not getting the surgery.

39:05.886 --> 39:06.923
Surgery?

39:06.943 --> 39:08.986
Yeah, to try and remove the tumor.

39:09.006 --> 39:10.404
You can do that?

39:10.424 --> 39:13.110
Well, it's not 100% effective.

39:13.918 --> 39:16.000
I mean, there's some major risks involved.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.324
What could be more major
than dying from it?

39:18.344 --> 39:19.816
Well, um...

39:19.836 --> 39:22.139
Waking up a vegetable,

39:22.174 --> 39:25.176
not being myself for the next 40 years,

39:25.210 --> 39:26.977
lying in a coma forever.

39:27.012 --> 39:30.247
So Mr. You-gotta-live is just giving up?

39:30.282 --> 39:32.116
April, you know me by now.

39:32.150 --> 39:34.084
Do you really think I would do well

39:34.119 --> 39:36.756
as a brain-dead hospital patient

39:36.776 --> 39:39.282
whose fate gets decided by doctors

39:39.302 --> 39:41.321
or my parents or some court?

39:41.341 --> 39:44.127
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna let that happen.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.897
I'm gonna die on my own terms

39:46.932 --> 39:50.748
with dignity and with this...
fully intact.

39:50.768 --> 39:52.414
What you're doing is quitting.

39:52.434 --> 39:54.379
- (Scoffs)
- And I'm not gonna quit.

39:54.399 --> 39:56.177
I'm gonna fight.

39:57.508 --> 39:59.385
Well, that's good for you.

40:04.943 --> 40:06.920
How are you feeling?

40:07.318 --> 40:09.159
I've been better.

40:09.179 --> 40:11.454
But thanks for taking such
good care of me last night.

40:11.474 --> 40:12.834
Yeah, of course.

40:12.854 --> 40:14.886
It's the least I could do.

40:14.906 --> 40:16.937
I feel terrible that that happened.

40:16.957 --> 40:21.045
Greer, Brenna, how'd you two like
my keynote address last night?

40:21.065 --> 40:23.546
It was phenomenal, Mr. Ostrowsky.

40:23.581 --> 40:26.483
I had no idea how harmful
ocean acidification

40:26.517 --> 40:27.818
was on marine life.

40:27.838 --> 40:31.063
You were very...
Jacques Cousteau-like.

40:31.083 --> 40:32.455
Thanks, Greer.

40:33.433 --> 40:34.980
Practicing in front of a mirror

40:35.000 --> 40:36.626
definitely helped.

40:37.763 --> 40:39.882
Okay, everyone, let's get moving.

40:39.902 --> 40:42.565
These dolphins aren't
gonna swim with themselves.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.301
How did you...

40:44.335 --> 40:46.703
Annie recorded it on her
phone and sent it to me.

40:46.737 --> 40:49.472
I knew I had to cover all my bases.

40:49.507 --> 40:51.508
Thanks for going with me to meet Natalie.

40:51.542 --> 40:53.543
I would have regretted it if I hadn't.

40:53.577 --> 40:55.478
- Even though...
- She sucked.

40:55.513 --> 40:57.380
Kinda, yeah.

41:05.489 --> 41:07.257
Sara: Hey, honey.

41:07.291 --> 41:09.690
Okay, so dinner's in the oven,

41:09.710 --> 41:12.090
and Brenna's on her way home.

41:12.110 --> 41:13.644
Mom...

41:15.333 --> 41:17.467
I've been thinking a lot about death.

41:17.501 --> 41:18.686
Oh, April, that's not...

41:18.706 --> 41:21.304
No, it's okay,
I want to talk about it for a minute.

41:26.321 --> 41:28.845
If I were to die tomorrow,

41:28.865 --> 41:30.984
you know what I would regret the most?

41:31.004 --> 41:32.539
What?

41:32.961 --> 41:38.072
Having this tension between us,
or whatever it is. I just...

41:38.693 --> 41:42.394
- Can we go back to normal?
- Honey, yes, of course.

41:42.414 --> 41:45.699
- (Crying)
- (Door opens)

41:45.913 --> 41:47.400
Brenna.

41:47.435 --> 41:48.568
(Gasps) She's here!

41:48.603 --> 41:50.270
Brenna's home!

41:50.304 --> 41:51.671
Yay.

41:51.739 --> 41:54.169
Oh, good, everyone's finally home.

41:54.189 --> 41:56.476
How about a little bridge before dinner?

41:56.510 --> 41:58.832
- April: Yes.
- Oh, mother...

41:59.547 --> 42:00.964
Grandma, you know we suck.

42:00.984 --> 42:02.979
Oh good. I'll take all your money then.

42:02.999 --> 42:04.745
Anyway,
no one could be worse than this one.

42:04.881 --> 42:05.796
(All chuckle)

42:05.797 --> 42:08.221
So, Brenna, tell us everything.

42:08.255 --> 42:10.209
How was your trip to Florida?

42:10.229 --> 42:13.460
It was... informational,

42:13.494 --> 42:15.319
to say the least.

42:16.028 --> 42:18.431
All right, ladies, enough chitchat.

42:18.466 --> 42:20.200
I'm gonna kick some butt here.

42:20.234 --> 42:21.568
- I will keep score.
- (Sara laughing)

42:21.602 --> 42:24.371
Funny? It's not funny, no.

42:24.405 --> 42:25.572
You remember how to play this game?

42:25.606 --> 42:27.440
I remember how to play the game,
mother, barely.

42:27.475 --> 42:29.542
Four suits,
does your mother know about the suits?

42:30.106 --> 42:31.645
- (Laughing)
- I'm terrible.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.313
It's really not that hard.

42:33.347 --> 42:35.315
