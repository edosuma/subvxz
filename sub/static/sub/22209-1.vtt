00:05.665 --> 00:08.556
ALL OF MY HEART: INN LOVE

00:08.949 --> 00:12.449
subrip: Pix

00:16.117 --> 00:17.216
good morning.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.117
Good morning...

00:19.420 --> 00:20.452
You know, I really
gotta fix these stairs

00:20.488 --> 00:21.553
before the inn opens.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.821
Let's worry about
the rooms first.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.889
Honey, October 10th's
only two weeks away.

00:23.924 --> 00:24.823
You know that, right?

00:24.892 --> 00:25.824
We'll be ready.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.627
I just love fall.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.764
The leaves are turning.
The air is so crisp.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.966
I'll take any time of year,
as long as it includes you.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.634
That is a good line.

00:35.669 --> 00:36.935
A little corny,
but true.

00:36.971 --> 00:37.970
Well, it worked.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.138
Okay, what are we doing?

00:39.173 --> 00:39.972
Okay, I've got
to drop the croissants off

00:40.007 --> 00:41.106
at the coffee shop,

00:41.142 --> 00:42.841
and then, I still need
to get curtains

00:42.910 --> 00:44.076
for the guest room.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.477
-You know what I was thinking?
-What?

00:45.513 --> 00:46.912
These beautiful planters here.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.847
We need some, like,
orange and gold flowers...

00:48.916 --> 00:49.815
And some pumpkins.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.116
Of course.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.584
You can't have a b&b without
flowers and pumpkins.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.119
No, and it's bucks county.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.754
Celebrating the season
is the law.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.156
Who would have thought it?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.490
Thought what?

00:58.526 --> 01:00.692
I live in a small town,
and people know my name.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.094
It's nice to feel
like you belong.

01:02.129 --> 01:03.462
Like this guy...
Yeah, but I grew up

01:03.497 --> 01:05.364
in the mean streets
of Manhattan, honey.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.965
Being friendly
is a big adjustment.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.101
Well, you seem like
you're holding up really well.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.602
Well, I appreciate that.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.771
Look!

01:12.807 --> 01:15.107
Pretty soon, that's
going to be you and me.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.275
I don't know
about you,

01:16.310 --> 01:17.309
but I think I'd look
better in a tux.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.946
Hey.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.148
I live to make you laugh.
You know that.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.620
And it doesn't hurt you
staring at me like that

01:28.656 --> 01:29.555
with those beautiful eyes.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.058
I mean, all of my dreams
are coming true.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.660
The inn is opening.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.862
Jenny's home bakes
is taking off,

01:36.897 --> 01:38.230
and whoever thought
I would own a company?

01:38.299 --> 01:40.499
Well, I did,
but you know what?

01:40.534 --> 01:43.469
I only proposed to you
because of those scones.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.171
The best part of the dream
was finding you.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.973
Six months ago,
we didn't even know each other.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.041
Yeah, well,
look at us now, right?

01:50.478 --> 01:52.211
I couldn't be happier.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.246
I know.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.548
Kind of have that effect
on people.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.687
-Look at this!
-There you go.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.356
It's got a lot of drawers
for the guests.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.358
I really think this says
"Emily's Country Inn."

02:08.062 --> 02:10.329
Look at that.
It also says "expensive."

02:10.364 --> 02:11.663
Well, what about this one?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.701
Okay, wait.
This one is perfect.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.870
Look at that.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.605
It's a little worn,
but we can Polish it up.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.606
What do you think?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.875
This one...

02:22.910 --> 02:24.710
Says that
"this is our dresser."

02:24.745 --> 02:25.844
That's what
I think it says, too.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.212
High five.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.680
Love your work.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.249
I'm going to have
to Polish this, though.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.850
It's a very nice piece.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.285
-Hi.
-hi.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.553
We're opening a b&b.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.554
I think this could be

02:35.589 --> 02:36.688
just perfect.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.557
A lot of my customers
have b&bs.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.626
So I guess the competition
must be pretty stiff, then.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.361
No, but it's a good time
of year to open.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.428
People are traveling
out to the country

02:43.464 --> 02:44.963
to see the leaves turn.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.865
It doesn't get any prettier
than bucks county in the fall.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.367
I agree.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.768
I love this lamp.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.704
How much is this lamp?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.340
I'm actually having
a special today...

02:55.376 --> 02:57.075
A free lamp
with every dresser.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.043
Really?

02:59.180 --> 03:01.079
Thank you so much.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.581
I am going to give this lamp
such a good home.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.217
Does she always get
this emotional about furniture?

03:05.252 --> 03:07.186
Just over free lamps.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.887
Well,
you guys are a lot of fun.

03:08.923 --> 03:09.955
She is.
I'm still learning.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.424
No, I think
you're doing pretty good.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.725
See?
Doing pretty good.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.093
Pretty good.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.736
Something smells really good,

03:24.772 --> 03:26.104
and I think I'm going to try it.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.272
Go for it!

03:27.308 --> 03:28.307
I'm experimenting
with pumpkin croissants

03:28.375 --> 03:29.541
to take to the coffee shop.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.044
Yeah.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.048
If you bake it,
they will come...

03:36.083 --> 03:37.115
In droves.

03:37.151 --> 03:39.117
Good.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.485
My distributor's expanding,
so I just want them to know

03:40.554 --> 03:42.421
that my little company
can keep up with the demand.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.623
Well, back at the inn,

03:44.658 --> 03:45.424
remember the heater
in one of the guest rooms?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.060
Yeah, it's on the Fritz.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.461
No. no, no, no, no, no.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.562
I can't handle any more fritzes.
I have too much to do.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.331
Relax.
I will have a sit down

03:52.399 --> 03:53.599
and have a chat
with the heater.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.434
Yeah, but my to-do list,
it keeps getting longer.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.636
I swear, I cross off one thing,
three more appear.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.837
Well, I have a to-do list, too.

03:58.906 --> 03:59.905
I've got to go see Tommy

03:59.940 --> 04:00.973
about these knobs
for this cabinet.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.175
This remodel was worth
every penny...

04:03.244 --> 04:05.277
That we no longer have.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.079
Yeah, but I do love
my new spacious kitchen

04:07.114 --> 04:08.380
that I get to cook in.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.581
I just want
to make the be breakfast

04:09.617 --> 04:10.749
in bucks county.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.984
I think you have that title
all sewn up.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.120
Thank you.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.053
I have to say, though,
cooking with my ring,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.223
it's...
it's pretty distracting.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.757
And I'm blind.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.459
Sometimes, I just stare at it,
and I forget to stir the sauce.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.896
I placed an ad for the inn.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.431
What's more important,
the inn or our romance?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.399
Come on.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.268
I'm trying to combine the two.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.802
Hello?

04:30.838 --> 04:32.404
Hi!

04:32.439 --> 04:33.605
Hi, yes!

04:33.641 --> 04:35.974
Yes, we have a room.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.443
When will you be arriving?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.012
And your name?

04:41.248 --> 04:42.748
Okay, then...
That is great.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.182
We will see you then.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.250
Thank you!

04:46.287 --> 04:47.352
What?

04:47.421 --> 04:48.287
We just got our first booking.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.421
Awesome!

04:49.456 --> 04:51.123
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley
will be arriving

04:51.158 --> 04:52.457
on October 10th.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.492
I'm so proud of you.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.493
She sounded so nice.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.428
And how can you tell?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.131
Well, she picked
Emily's Country Inn, right?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.967
Good.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.969
On that romantic note,
I'm going to go feed the goats.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.004
Okay.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.039
And I'm going to take
another one of these.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.274
-Hey.
-No.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.114
I just wish I had
a few more planters.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.883
I want it to look
perfect for the guests.

05:17.951 --> 05:18.950
Let's hope
they're into goats.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.353
Don't give me...
Come here.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.988
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not going over there.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.356
Get off!

05:24.391 --> 05:26.224
Ricky, come on!
Ricky!

05:26.293 --> 05:28.827
Brian and his flock have
certainly a special bond,

05:28.862 --> 05:29.828
don't they?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.296
I got her.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.098
I'll tell you what she said,
but it's confidential.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.200
Not your typical career path,

05:35.269 --> 05:37.302
from, you know,
MBA to Wall Street...

05:37.338 --> 05:38.970
I heard you!
I heard you...

05:39.006 --> 05:40.372
To goat-herder.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.041
Now the only stocks
I have in my life are livestock.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.309
I'm just not sure yet
what to do

05:44.345 --> 05:47.145
with my investments
having a tail.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.780
Okay.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.221
Yeah.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.724
Musical plumbing
and creaking stairs.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.891
Let's hope our
guests like a house

05:59.960 --> 06:01.560
with sound effects, right?

06:01.628 --> 06:03.662
This looks just perfect.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.297
Yeah.
The price was certainly right.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.299
You know what else
I want to do?

06:07.334 --> 06:08.166
I want to get
a little embroidered pillow

06:08.202 --> 06:09.201
on each bed

06:09.236 --> 06:10.836
that says, "welcome..."

06:10.871 --> 06:11.970
And I was also thinking

06:12.005 --> 06:13.538
some fresh-cut flowers
for the nightstands.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.806
And don't forget

06:14.842 --> 06:15.974
the best breakfast
they ever ate.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.143
These people
may never leave.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.978
B&B's thrive
on repeat business.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.713
That's true.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.582
What?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.851
Nothing, I just...

06:25.886 --> 06:27.219
My new identity
as an innkeeper's taking

06:27.254 --> 06:28.520
a little getting used to,
that's all.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.489
Do you ever think
about your old life in New York?

06:31.658 --> 06:33.392
Sometimes.
sort of.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.494
I mean, I just miss
the pace of the city.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.328
You know,
it matched my internal speed.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.197
Wall street runs
on adrenaline.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.565
It's just hard
to slow down, that's all...

06:40.601 --> 06:44.102
But I will take contentment
over commerce any day.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.406
And... are you content?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.042
I'm getting there.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.210
You know what?

06:52.246 --> 06:53.278
I think I should get
a new tablecloth

06:53.347 --> 06:54.713
for the dining room table,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.248
and maybe get
some new coffee mugs.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.018
Yeah.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.421
It's not exactly even, is it?

07:02.456 --> 07:04.089
No one will notice
when I put the curtains on it.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.091
Symmetry isn't high
on your list, is it?

07:07.294 --> 07:08.593
Obviously not.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.695
I'm sorry.
It's terrible.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.963
You know, I've been
reading this travel blog

07:12.032 --> 07:14.132
called "the out-of-towner,"

07:14.201 --> 07:16.768
and basically, she covers
the pitfalls of B&Bs, and...

07:16.804 --> 07:18.069
I don't know,
I'm starting to think

07:18.105 --> 07:19.938
maybe we should spring
for better WiFi service.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.307
Honey,
the remodel just tapped us out.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.575
I mean, how much more a month
are you talking about?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.076
This woman is
really well-known.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.046
She gave someone two stars
for a lousy Internet connection.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.248
Great.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.083
Okay...

07:32.119 --> 07:33.218
I'll tell you what.
I'll do some research,

07:33.253 --> 07:34.386
and I'll try to get us
the best deal.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.921
Thanks.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.322
I'd better go

07:37.391 --> 07:38.657
'cause I have to drop stuff off
at the coffee shop.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.759
You know what else?
I've got to get new towels.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.994
Get more stuff.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.629
Bleed me dry.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.768
Good morning!

07:49.803 --> 07:50.969
Hi!

07:51.004 --> 07:52.671
Hi!
Okay, so...

07:52.739 --> 07:53.839
I brought a few new things

07:53.907 --> 07:54.606
just to try and see
if they would sell.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.576
It's our only income
until the inn opens.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.580
Okay, I can't tell anyone
until the ink is dry,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.014
but my boss is retiring,

08:03.083 --> 08:03.982
and I'm going
to buy the coffee shop.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.251
What?
That is so exciting!

08:06.286 --> 08:08.019
I know!

08:08.088 --> 08:09.621
And when I own this place,

08:09.656 --> 08:10.522
I will take
all the Jenny's home baked

08:10.591 --> 08:11.623
that you can bring me.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.191
Thank you.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.761
October 10th's the big day.
Tell all your friends.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.129
There's so many b&bs
opening in bucks county,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.065
so we would really appreciate
the word-of-mouth.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.466
I just hope
that my cooking

08:21.502 --> 08:23.268
is enough to set us apart.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.403
Are you kidding?
This looks amazing.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.305
Thank you.
Have a good day.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.673
Bye!

08:32.479 --> 08:33.477
Hey, vern!

08:35.015 --> 08:35.981
Hey, hey!

08:36.015 --> 08:38.416
I saw your ad for the inn.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.785
Boy, you and Jenny
have come a long way

08:41.822 --> 08:43.321
since you inherited that house.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.656
Well, an old lady
writes a will,

08:44.691 --> 08:46.124
and next thing you know,

08:46.159 --> 08:47.292
I'm driving
an old pick-up truck,

08:47.327 --> 08:48.627
and I'm hanging out
at the general store.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.628
You were like
a duck out of water

08:49.663 --> 08:50.595
when you came here.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.696
It's true.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.032
I still have
my unsteady moments, vern...

08:54.101 --> 08:56.167
Little tugs
of who I used to be,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.602
but every time
I look in Jenny's eyes...

08:57.638 --> 08:58.970
Yeah?

08:59.006 --> 08:59.938
I remember that's
the man I want to be.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.040
Well, keep looking.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.842
Well, thank you.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.809
Don't...
don't...

09:04.845 --> 09:05.877
Don't touch?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.379
-I won't do that ever again.
-Hey!

09:07.447 --> 09:09.014
Here's your better half.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.382
Hey, vern!

09:10.450 --> 09:12.784
Did you hear Emily's Country Inn
is finally opening?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.319
You did well by her.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.288
That means a lot
coming from you.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.689
Thanks.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.357
I see that suitcase over there.
You going somewhere?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.527
I've got a niece in Philly
who's getting married.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.695
Okay.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.298
Nothing I like better
than a wedding.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.699
Well, we'll make sure

09:27.734 --> 09:28.700
that you're the first to know
when we pick a date, 'Kay?

09:28.735 --> 09:30.669
I better be.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.737
All right, I've got to go
pick up the rest of the fabric.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.172
Yeah, actually,

09:34.207 --> 09:35.006
I've got to pick up those knobs
for the cabinets, so...

09:35.042 --> 09:36.675
Enjoy your wedding.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.044
Well, it's just a warm-up
for yours, sweetheart.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.045
Thanks.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.079
Love you!

09:41.148 --> 09:42.514
-Bye!
-bye.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.250
Now, try not to mess things up
while I'm away, okay?

09:45.319 --> 09:47.719
I will do my best.
I promise.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.756
Looks like your ride is here.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.560
How soon they come.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.195
All right.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.598
Listen...
there's a storm coming, too.

10:00.767 --> 10:01.700
What are you
talking about, vern?

10:01.735 --> 10:02.734
Looks okay to me.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.236
Nah, I got a trick knee,

10:05.272 --> 10:08.707
and it hurts
every time it's going to rain.

10:08.742 --> 10:12.010
You can call it
my own personal barometer.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.545
Barometer.
here we go!

10:13.580 --> 10:14.613
Why don't you help me?

10:14.681 --> 10:15.847
I'm helping you.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.351
Morning, Trish.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.288
Hey! hey, frank.
How are you?

10:23.357 --> 10:24.556
Good.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.358
Did you get my invoice
for the kitchen counter?

10:26.393 --> 10:27.225
I did, yes.
I did, absolutely,

10:27.260 --> 10:28.560
and...

10:28.595 --> 10:30.061
Actually, Jenny
is making a delivery

10:30.097 --> 10:31.096
to her distributor,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.530
so we'll send you a check

10:32.566 --> 10:33.932
as soon as the funds
hit the account.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.100
Yeah, that's
fair. Okay.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.234
Tell Jenny
I say hi, okay?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.469
Will do.
Nice work, by the way.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.770
Thank you.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.210
This remodel is costing us

10:45.245 --> 10:46.077
every nickel
that we've ever had.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.614
I guess I'll have to do
the repairs myself.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.116
My condolences to the house.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.217
Thanks.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.618
Speaking of repairs,

10:53.654 --> 10:56.488
can I pick up those knobs
for those cabinets, please?

10:56.556 --> 10:57.956
How's Jenny liking
her new kitchen?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.057
You kidding me?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.158
She's a professional chef, man.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.260
It's like Picasso
with a new canvas.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.463
So the inn's
finally going to open.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.331
Hey, yeah, you should send
some of your friends.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.565
We could use the business.

11:07.601 --> 11:10.301
That'd put me
between a rock and my ex-wife.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.070
You care to explain?

11:12.105 --> 11:15.373
Gloria is turning
my former home,

11:15.409 --> 11:16.408
with my big-screen TV

11:16.443 --> 11:17.542
and the backyard patio

11:17.577 --> 11:19.044
that I built myself,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.378
into a b&b.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.480
That house is pretty small.
You mean the airbnb?

11:22.549 --> 11:25.116
She didn't say what type.
I just know it ain't right.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.618
Yeah, good stuff.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.420
Hey, you and Jenny going
to the music festival?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.221
Afraid not, man.
We're too busy with the inn.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.756
You've got to come.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.224
My band's playing.
It's our debut.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.227
You're in a band?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.401
I just put the kettle on,

11:43.437 --> 11:45.303
and the sewing machine
is ready to go.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.905
Thank you so much, Alice.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.073
Just need
to finish the piping

11:48.108 --> 11:50.108
on the quilt and the shams.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.248
I can't believe
how much I still have to do

11:57.284 --> 11:59.284
before the inn opens.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.952
Well, this is
nearly done.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.155
It's very pretty.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.190
You know, who knew

12:05.258 --> 12:06.458
an inherited house

12:06.493 --> 12:07.692
would come
with such a good friend?

12:07.761 --> 12:10.128
Emily gave me
a great neighbor.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.165
I just wish
I had known her.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.300
I hope I do her house justice.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.802
You and Brian filled it
with joy.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.938
The decorating is just gravy.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.141
I wanted to tell you

12:23.176 --> 12:24.943
that I saw
a wedding dress I like.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.146
I saw it in a store window.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.449
Which begs the question,
when is the wedding?

12:31.485 --> 12:32.650
I have too much on my plate
right now

12:32.686 --> 12:33.985
to plan a wedding.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.188
We have to focus on getting
the inn up and running,

12:37.224 --> 12:39.224
and, well, I'm also trying
to expand Jenny's home baked,

12:39.292 --> 12:40.992
and my distributor expects me
to keep up the pace.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.528
Well, you know best.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.533
The remodel also cost
more than we thought.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.669
I can tell that Brian's
really worried about money,

12:51.705 --> 12:53.004
and I just want
to walk down the aisle

12:53.039 --> 12:55.507
when the only thing on his mind
is him and me.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.844
That kind of consideration
is how you make it last.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.149
Where would I be
without you, Alice?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.352
One quilt and
two shams short.

13:10.857 --> 13:11.823
Hey! what're you doing?

13:11.858 --> 13:12.757
Hey, babe.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.726
I am putting on
this last knob

13:14.761 --> 13:16.194
on the cabinets,

13:16.229 --> 13:16.995
and then you and I are taking
the rest of the day off,

13:17.030 --> 13:17.896
and we're going on a date.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.897
We are?

13:20.066 --> 13:21.766
The music festival
in Buckingham.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.835
Well, don't get me wrong,
I'm all in,

13:23.870 --> 13:25.203
but why there?
Why now?

13:25.238 --> 13:28.506
Well...
Rusty's, band is playing.

13:28.542 --> 13:31.075
Wait...
Rusty the tow-truck driver?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.577
Yeah, that'd be...
Yeah, that'd be him.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.913
He doesn't seem like
the musician type.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.281
Well, I don't seem like
the goat farmer type.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.382
That's true.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.216
I do pretty
good, though.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.284
You're a cute one.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.618
Let's go rock out.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.287
I hope there's
some '80s music.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.388
Come on,
we can do it.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.455
Squeeze through.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.691
One less croissant,
and I could make it!

13:46.726 --> 13:48.927
I am so glad
we're doing this...

13:48.962 --> 13:49.727
Going on a date.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.262
Me too.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.064
You know, we went
from strangers to homeowners

13:53.099 --> 13:54.599
to engaged.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.034
We kind of skipped
the whole courtship, right?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.435
Well then, it's high time
we do this, right?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.237
No goats, no worries,

13:59.272 --> 14:00.672
just the two of us.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.273
You know, we've never even been
to the movies.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.341
Well, of course,

14:03.376 --> 14:04.442
because vin diesel
and Meryl Streep

14:04.511 --> 14:06.578
have never been
in a film together, so...

14:06.613 --> 14:07.779
Okay, I've got
to ask you this.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.247
Buttered popcorn or plain?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.115
Buttered, but only
if it's the real deal.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.283
Well, the real deal
works for me.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.552
All right,
thank you all for coming out.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.855
This is my band,
Rusty and the breaks.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.858
Hope you enjoy
what we have for you.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:38.979 --> 14:40.945
Who knew?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.781
Man, they are not bad.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.126
You want to dance?

14:55.161 --> 14:56.294
I thought
you'd never ask.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.064
You love your dancing.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.196
I love you.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.134
I never want this song to end.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.769
Me neither.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.176
I love you, Jenny.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.719
I love the rain.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.788
Dancing in the rain.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.143
I love you

16:19.179 --> 16:20.478
more and more every
moment I'm with you.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.518
I hope the roof
doesn't leak!

16:27.554 --> 16:29.520
It's going to be...

16:35.528 --> 16:37.996
All right!
All right! I get it!

16:44.304 --> 16:46.871
Hey, how's it...
How's it going out here?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.041
How's it going up here?

16:50.076 --> 16:52.243
I don't think
roofing is my calling.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.245
You're doing a good job.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.313
How would you know?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.084
Yeah, that didn't work.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.029
Hey, I'm going to run
to the coffee shop

17:11.064 --> 17:12.329
and drop off
the pastries.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.865
I don't think those shingles
are going to hold.

17:13.900 --> 17:14.898
I'm going to have
to tarp them.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.067
I'm sorry.
Good luck.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.068
Be safe.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.102
I will.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.503
-Please.
-okay.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.010
The house is a wreck.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.046
Thank you so much
for taking me in.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.181
You can stay at my place
for as long as you like.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.516
Yeah, good,
'cause rain or shine,

17:31.551 --> 17:34.018
Jenny's home baked
has to be made and delivered.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.120
We need the money
more than ever.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.022
My kitchen
is your kitchen.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.757
Thanks.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.027
Hey.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.062
Hey.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.530
You know that tarp?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.298
Yeah, it got,
blown off the roof.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.067
I'm sorry.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.401
Yeah, the roof
sprang a new leak,

17:50.437 --> 17:51.436
and a leak after that,
and another one, actually,

17:51.471 --> 17:52.737
so all those rooms
upstairs are...

17:52.772 --> 17:53.871
They're getting wetter
and wetter by the hour.

17:53.907 --> 17:54.705
So what are we going to do?

17:54.741 --> 17:55.907
Move.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.708
I'd laugh, but I think
I'm forgetting how.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.078
That's good.
Appropriate.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.079
Yeah, we should
actually call this

18:01.114 --> 18:02.080
"emily's ark."

18:02.115 --> 18:03.881
Yeah.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.316
Turn it into a cruise ship.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.250
I'll be its captain.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.859
Thanks, Tommy.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.965
The couch is yours
for as long as you need it.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.768
Thanks, Tommy.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.937
So how bad is the house?

18:25.972 --> 18:28.106
Well, all the upstairs rooms
are all wet.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.441
Jenny and I have no idea
what we're going to do.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.176
Well,
I can help you fix the roof.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.179
I...
man, I don't know what to say.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.481
Say good night.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.052
Good night.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.220
Night.

18:43.523 --> 18:48.226
Honey, my room
is completely soaked.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.633
Well, all of our guests
are going to need wetsuits.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.835
Welcome to
Emily's Country Inn.

18:57.871 --> 18:58.903
My room's a mess,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.538
not to mention
all the guest rooms.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.640
Yeah, I feel like my dreams
are literally drowning.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.242
Hey, hey, hey.
No, it's okay.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.512
Right, what's a little weather
when you're in love?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.479
Do you remember
this is the spot

19:08.515 --> 19:10.014
where we first kissed?

19:10.049 --> 19:12.216
I do.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.318
I guess every storm
has its upside?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.690
We'll get through this.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.227
Look at this.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.666
"I'd rather be fishing."

19:28.701 --> 19:30.668
That's nice.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.569
A storm
with a sense of humor.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.972
No, our sign!

19:35.008 --> 19:36.841
You think it's a sign?

19:36.876 --> 19:40.811
I think
what it means is up to us.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.079
Let's see...

19:44.551 --> 19:46.083
You see?

19:46.152 --> 19:48.519
And I think it says
we are going to be just fine.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.890
I still think it says
we need a new roof, but...

19:52.926 --> 19:53.858
You know.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.395
Balancing books
is a lot different

19:57.430 --> 19:58.563
than waiting tables.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.599
You know what, maybe
we could help each other out.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.268
I mean, my kitchen is
great for making breakfast,

20:04.337 --> 20:06.204
but I could possibly expand
Jenny's home baked

20:06.239 --> 20:08.005
if I had a commercial kitchen
to cook in.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.574
You can use mine
whenever you want.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.209
No, I couldn't do that to you.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.578
The utilities alone
would be crazy.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.879
I'd have to do something for you
in return.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.381
This is some negotiation.
Whose side are you on?

20:17.417 --> 20:18.716
Ours.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.252
Okay, how about this?

20:21.287 --> 20:23.354
If I provide the pastries
for the coffee shop,

20:23.389 --> 20:24.922
will you let me cook here
when you're closed?

20:26.926 --> 20:27.892
You're on.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.260
Really?

20:29.295 --> 20:31.095
Yeah.
being my own boss rocks.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.898
It rocks
when it isn't raining.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.100
Our first guests arrive
next week.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.703
There's still so much to do.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.238
I'm a little worried
about Brian.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.607
I feel like maybe this is more
than he bargained for.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.442
Maybe you should ask him.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.746
Yeah.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.123
Well, hello.

20:59.158 --> 21:02.059
You know, we've really got
to stop meeting like this.

21:02.095 --> 21:02.960
Come here.
Let me help you.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.132
Are you becoming disenchanted
with a house in the country

21:08.167 --> 21:10.268
and opening an inn?

21:10.303 --> 21:11.168
What are you
talking about?

21:11.237 --> 21:13.104
Honey, come on! No.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.972
I love this house.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.308
I just wish it were drier
and open for business.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.643
Me too.

21:18.678 --> 21:19.443
Good.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.145
Sorry.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.079
Got a phone call.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.751
Hello. Emily's Country Inn.
How can I help you?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.621
No, no, of course, no.

21:30.657 --> 21:31.689
Bucks county
is lovely in the fall.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.524
Is it just for you?

21:33.593 --> 21:34.525
Well then, okay, Mr. Albert.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.926
We'll see you then.

21:35.962 --> 21:36.961
You are going
to love it here.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.630
All right.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.299
Take care.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.833
Honey...

21:42.869 --> 21:44.268
This is good news.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.003
We have three guests
and none of the rooms are done.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.638
They will be...

21:47.674 --> 21:48.639
You know, eventually.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.107
Okay, let's...

21:50.143 --> 21:51.208
Let's do
the stanleys' first

21:51.277 --> 21:52.176
and then we'll do
Mr. Albert's.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.045
Plan.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.147
He sounded
like a really nice guy.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.215
Maybe he'd be willing
to bunk with the goats.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.451
I'm going to have
to clean these.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.856
What are you doing?

22:05.892 --> 22:08.025
What? it's just a moment
of self-expression.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.694
A semi-gloss wish.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.062
Wait, semi-gloss?

22:11.130 --> 22:12.029
Yeah, that's
all we have left,

22:12.065 --> 22:13.064
but it's water-resistant,

22:13.132 --> 22:13.998
in case we have
another storm.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.266
By the way,

22:15.301 --> 22:16.133
tommy and I are going to fix
the roof this weekend,

22:16.169 --> 22:17.268
I promise,

22:17.303 --> 22:18.636
so it never rains
in our house again.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.970
Good.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.316
Honey, what are you doing?

22:34.887 --> 22:35.853
The drawer is stuck.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.521
It needs to dry out.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.789
Sweetie,
it's an antique.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.192
And, well, that storm
aged it another 50 years.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.160
Hey!
look what I found.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.995
Those must have been Emily's.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.464
Yeah, doesn't say much
for her taste.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.699
I think
they're very moving.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.201
You know, shoes say a lot
about a person.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.236
Yeah, I think these shoes say
she needs a new roof.

22:52.305 --> 22:53.371
You know, I just love finding
little traces of Emily

22:53.406 --> 22:54.472
around the house.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.840
All I found
was a rolling pin

22:55.875 --> 22:57.575
and a popular mechanics
magazine.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.976
I don't know about you,

22:59.011 --> 23:00.745
but I think our benefactor
was a very complex woman.

23:00.813 --> 23:04.215
She was lonely, you know,
trying to fend for herself.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.517
How can you be so attached
to someone you never even knew?

23:06.552 --> 23:07.852
She's family.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.720
Your mom's aunt
was her cousin.

23:09.756 --> 23:10.721
That wasn't even first-string.

23:10.757 --> 23:11.856
Nevertheless...

23:11.891 --> 23:12.990
And I was the descendant
of her caretaker,

23:13.025 --> 23:14.592
so forgive my irreverence,
but honey...

23:14.660 --> 23:16.160
You know,
if it weren't for Emily,

23:16.195 --> 23:17.061
we never would have met.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.331
All right.
Point taken.

23:20.366 --> 23:21.399
You do know, legally,

23:21.434 --> 23:22.433
one of those shoes
does belong to me.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.402
There you are.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.270
Thank you.

23:26.339 --> 23:27.438
I don't know about you,

23:27.507 --> 23:29.507
but I think I'm going
to bronze mine.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.010
You do that.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.879
Might even try them on.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.250
Hey.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.885
Why do you have
a toolbox?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.186
This?

23:42.221 --> 23:43.120
Well, let me tell you...

23:43.189 --> 23:45.256
I have a new rule.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.892
"First, do no harm."

23:47.927 --> 23:48.926
Yeah, it's the oath
the doctors take.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.897
And what are you going
to be repairing?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.632
Honey,
the stairs got really wet.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.699
They're creaking
more than ever.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.101
I like stairs I can hear.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.603
Really?
okay... all right.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.447
Did you break the stairs?

24:09.482 --> 24:10.815
No.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.383
I did no harm,

24:12.418 --> 24:14.452
but unfortunately,
the creaking was incurable,

24:14.487 --> 24:15.619
except for,
of course...

24:16.889 --> 24:19.924
The fourth step
from the bottom.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.729
See?

24:25.765 --> 24:28.799
And one silent step
before the big finish.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.805
You know what?
I kind of like the variation.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.608
Do you?
Creak! Creak!

24:39.011 --> 24:40.811
Just love me and
love my toolbox.

24:40.847 --> 24:41.812
I do.

24:41.848 --> 24:42.913
Good.

24:44.517 --> 24:45.983
We eating yet?

24:49.522 --> 24:50.855
A phonecall?

24:52.458 --> 24:53.524
Hey, Harry.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.092
Hey, I got your message.
What's up?

24:55.127 --> 24:56.660
Listen, you know,
the inn's about to open.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.028
I just thought
I'd put the offer out

24:58.097 --> 24:59.630
and see if any friends
are looking for a vacation.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.066
I'll be sure
to send them your way.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.834
How are you liking life
in the sticks?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.769
Are you kidding me?
It's great...

25:05.805 --> 25:06.971
I mean,
apart from the leaky house

25:07.006 --> 25:09.507
and the lack of income...

25:09.575 --> 25:10.808
But you know
what I was thinking?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.142
I'm going to do
a little financial consulting.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.744
<i>Just put up a shingle.</i>

25:13.779 --> 25:15.412
I hear bucks county is teeming
with mergers and acquisitions.

25:15.448 --> 25:17.181
Okay, you know what, I get it.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.415
You know, maybe I didn't think
this thing through,

25:18.451 --> 25:19.650
but don't rub it in, all right?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.252
<i>No kidding.</i>

25:21.287 --> 25:22.453
<i>Hey, I've got to run.
I'm locking up this deal.</i>

25:23.623 --> 25:25.122
You know what, Harry?
Good timing...

25:25.157 --> 25:26.423
'Cause I've got a goat
to deal with.

25:26.459 --> 25:27.358
I'll call you later, buddy.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.759
All right.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.495
Coming, Gabby.

25:31.531 --> 25:32.930
You know,
at this point, Tommy,

25:32.965 --> 25:34.598
you're five shingles
to my one.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.768
My dad was a carpenter,
and his dad was a Mason,

25:37.803 --> 25:39.203
so home improvements
are in my genes.

25:39.272 --> 25:41.839
Yeah, well,
my dad traded stocks.

25:41.874 --> 25:42.873
His dad was a broker.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.942
You can make your own destiny.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.645
Yeah, I just don't think
it should involve roofing.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.782
What?

25:51.817 --> 25:54.318
Wasn't enough paper
in your dinner?

25:54.353 --> 25:55.853
Come here, Gabby.
Hey, Gabby.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.154
What's that?
There you go.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.789
Yeah, that's
the last of my resumes, okay?

25:58.824 --> 26:00.224
Eat up.

26:00.293 --> 26:01.859
Everything I thought
I wanted to be.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.130
Well, I appreciate
your sensitivity, yeah.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.197
Thanks there, Gabby...

26:08.868 --> 26:10.367
But I'll be fine.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.569
Why don't you share it
with your babies?

26:16.642 --> 26:17.808
Why don't you share it
with your babies?

26:21.981 --> 26:22.913
Come here.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.283
You know, Tommy's couch
is getting pretty old.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.384
I'm not getting much sleep,

26:27.420 --> 26:28.319
so I can't wait
until he comes over,

26:28.387 --> 26:29.486
and we can fix up
this roof today.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.555
Yeah,
we can finish those rooms,

26:31.591 --> 26:34.558
and Emily's Country Inn
can officially open.

26:34.594 --> 26:35.826
Can't wait.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.266
What do you think?

26:42.301 --> 26:43.233
What do you mean,
what do I think?

26:43.269 --> 26:44.268
Look at this thing!

26:44.303 --> 26:45.569
It's awesome.
It's amazing.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.805
I'm running out
of adjectives.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.672
It's harvest Berry waffles.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.178
You know, I'm going to die
a very fat and happy man.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.346
Just hopefully not a poor one.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.780
That would be good.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.682
I just feel like everything's
going to be great now.

26:58.751 --> 26:59.984
Don't do that again.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.585
You're always seeing
the silver linings.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.487
Yeah, says
the prince of doubt.

27:03.522 --> 27:04.421
What are you talking about?
I'm a realist.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.323
No, you're a pessimist...

27:06.359 --> 27:07.324
With a lot of potential.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.026
Well, thank you.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.128
It's a good thing
opposites attract.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.096
Definitely.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.432
-Hi!
-hi!

27:17.470 --> 27:19.637
That is the last of
the fruit from my trees.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.038
Thanks, Alice.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.473
You can thank me with pie.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.676
We got another reservation
for the inn.

27:25.711 --> 27:26.977
That's great.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.345
Yeah.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.980
You know, I've been reading
this blog about b&bs,

27:30.016 --> 27:31.215
and there's just so much
I want to do

27:31.283 --> 27:32.316
when we can afford it.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.818
There's a county fair
in Warwick.

27:34.854 --> 27:35.886
You could sell
your baked goods there

27:35.955 --> 27:37.121
and make some extra money.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.356
That's a great idea.

27:39.392 --> 27:41.058
I could make all kinds
of seasonal stuff.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.460
I could just make
every kind of pie,

27:43.496 --> 27:44.862
and who knows?
Maybe I could make enough

27:44.897 --> 27:46.697
to buy a new sofa
for the sitting area.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.265
I just want people

27:48.300 --> 27:51.535
to feel like Emily's Country Inn
is a second home, you know?

27:51.604 --> 27:53.871
The sofa's probably optional.

27:53.939 --> 27:57.207
Your enthusiasm
will do the trick.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.709
Well, hey, Alice!
How are you?

27:58.778 --> 27:59.777
Hey, I'm going
to make some pies

27:59.812 --> 28:01.011
and take them
to the county fair.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.546
Sounds like a great idea.

28:02.615 --> 28:03.814
I'm going for a run, okay?

28:03.849 --> 28:05.049
My trail got washed out
in the storm,

28:05.117 --> 28:05.816
so I might be
a little longer.

28:05.851 --> 28:06.984
Have fun!

28:07.019 --> 28:08.185
Okay.
good to see you, Alice!

28:08.220 --> 28:10.120
Yeah.
is there coffee?

28:10.156 --> 28:12.322
There's always coffee.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.861
Those muffins
look so good.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.396
Thanks! they're actually
raspberry buttermilk.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.066
Brian howell?

28:23.402 --> 28:24.501
Hi, Roger.
How are you?

28:25.738 --> 28:28.005
Dolling out muffins
instead of doing mergers?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.074
Actually, no, I...
Well...

28:30.142 --> 28:31.175
I inherited a house,

28:31.210 --> 28:32.710
and I moved out here
to bucks county.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.344
This is my fiancee's booth.
I'm just helping her out.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.512
Hi.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.480
You know,
I heard about what happened

28:36.515 --> 28:37.414
at your last firm, Brian.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.683
That was unfair.

28:39.719 --> 28:40.551
I appreciate
you taking my side, Roger.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.552
Thanks.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.487
Come on, daddy.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.222
Yeah, sure.
You made me a lot of money.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.757
The least I can do
is buy a box of those muffins.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.692
Here, keep the change.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.360
I owe you a lot more than that.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.431
Great.
thanks, Roger. That's...

28:54.500 --> 28:55.365
This is my wife, Laura.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.700
Hello.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.035
Hi, how are you?
This is Jenny.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.169
Hi.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.070
And what is your name?

29:00.106 --> 29:01.205
Shay.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.607
Brian and I
did a deal together

29:03.676 --> 29:04.908
a hundred years ago.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.510
It had been stalled.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.746
Brian walks in,
and we closed in a week.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.214
It's luck.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.381
Dad, I want
to go see the ponies.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.583
Yeah, let's go.

29:12.618 --> 29:13.951
Nice seeing you again, Brian.

29:14.019 --> 29:14.918
You as well, sir.

29:14.954 --> 29:15.953
Take care.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.857
He's a nice guy.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.626
Yeah, he was
my very first big client.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.461
Any regrets?

29:24.530 --> 29:25.696
He's a very wealthy man.

29:25.731 --> 29:26.930
My only regret
is not selling him more muffins.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.366
Bombarded. hi!

29:33.038 --> 29:33.871
I'm so proud of you.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.739
Thank you.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.275
You did all of this...

29:38.310 --> 29:39.543
And I'm so proud of you.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.544
Thank you for your help.

29:40.579 --> 29:41.912
Are you kidding me?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.247
People seemed
to really enjoy them.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.548
If we didn't sell them,
I was going to eat them all.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.551
Well, hello!

29:47.586 --> 29:48.652
Hi!

29:48.721 --> 29:50.420
Hi.
can you high-five?

29:50.456 --> 29:51.588
No?

29:51.624 --> 29:54.625
Yeah!
thatta girl.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.592
What a cute baby.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.766
You know, the goats
helped me cut the grass.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.002
I think we'll be ready
in time for the stanleys.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.938
Yeah.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.973
Looks pretty good
in here, actually.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.910
Yep, now we just have
to finish Mr. Albert's room.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.814
All right.
I'm on it.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.916
You know,
this innkeeping gig?

30:18.951 --> 30:20.784
It isn't easy.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.589
Break's over.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.361
Step aside, little lady.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.932
It's time I lowered this
an octave or two.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.400
You know what?
I like it this way.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.068
Let's just leave
well-enough alone.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.304
Why don't you step back...

30:40.339 --> 30:42.406
Focus on those baked goods...

30:42.441 --> 30:43.574
Oookay.

30:43.609 --> 30:46.577
And let your man...

30:46.612 --> 30:47.411
Do what men do.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.515
All right.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.616
That didn't work.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.923
Hey, Harry.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.191
Kind of busy right now.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.960
Well, not as busy
as you're going to be.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.128
What do you mean?

31:05.164 --> 31:07.331
You bumped into Bailey,
Roger Bailey.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.832
You sold him a muffin
or something?

31:10.336 --> 31:11.702
That's right.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.036
<i>I have been trying
to land him as a client.</i>

31:13.105 --> 31:14.271
<i>He wants me to bring you onboard</i>

31:14.306 --> 31:17.040
as a consultant
on a merger he's doing.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.610
Wouldn't it be sweet
to prove your old boss wrong

31:19.645 --> 31:20.510
for having let you go?

31:23.682 --> 31:24.781
Brian?

31:24.817 --> 31:26.483
Yeah, I'm, I'm...
Yeah, I'm here.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.718
I hear you, Harry.
I'm here.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.286
<i>Hey, between the two of us,</i>

31:29.321 --> 31:30.454
<i>we could have this thing
wrapped up in a couple of days.</i>

31:33.859 --> 31:35.025
Truth is, I could use the money.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.193
Do I take that as a "yes"?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.896
Yes.

31:38.964 --> 31:40.163
Yeah, you can... absolutely,
you can take it as "yes."

31:40.199 --> 31:41.999
Thanks, Harry.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.233
Appreciate the call.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.006
Roger Bailey wants me

31:49.041 --> 31:49.873
to help him close a deal
with Harry's firm.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.042
That's great.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.744
Yeah.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.712
I mean, wall street
doesn't carry the same allure

31:55.748 --> 31:57.314
as it once did.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.248
I mean, I'm done
with the bulls and bears.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.316
Prefer goats.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.884
That's good to know.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.353
Where was I?

32:03.389 --> 32:04.321
You were about
to break the sink.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.355
Right!

32:08.327 --> 32:09.726
It's going to get
serious down here.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.665
Hey, you guys.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.733
Hey, Gabby. Hey,
what do I have here?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.236
Listen, I'm going
to make sure

32:19.271 --> 32:20.671
to bring you
some spreadsheets for dessert.

32:20.706 --> 32:21.538
Okay?

32:21.573 --> 32:23.006
There we go...

32:23.042 --> 32:25.242
And you beautiful babies,
you guys behave.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.243
Oy...

32:27.546 --> 32:28.512
Look at me.

32:28.547 --> 32:29.846
Look at this.

32:29.882 --> 32:31.248
I'm going to be
the only guy on wall street

32:31.283 --> 32:32.182
with goat hair
on his suit.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.383
That's...

32:33.419 --> 32:34.952
You're certainly
the most handsome.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.753
You're too kind.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.121
You know,

32:38.190 --> 32:39.523
you sure you don't want me
to drive you to the station?

32:39.558 --> 32:40.424
Well, you've got enough to do.

32:40.459 --> 32:41.758
I'll be fine.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.194
The stanleys called,
and they are on their way.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.296
I'm,
I'm sorry I can't be here.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.364
No, it's okay.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.198
You'll see them
when you get back.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.132
Yeah.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.102
Okay.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.806
Good luck.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.909
I feel like a stock broker
going to a rodeo.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.045
Have fun.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.557
Hi, I'm Jenny.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.392
Welcome
to Emily's Country Inn.

33:15.427 --> 33:16.960
Hey, I'm Nora.
This is my husband, Wade.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.061
Hi.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.763
It's very nice to meet you.

33:19.798 --> 33:20.897
Come on.
I'll show you to your rooms.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.232
Perfect.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.739
Come in.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.574
So, did you have any trouble
finding the house?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.709
My GPS got
a little confused.

33:32.745 --> 33:35.045
I made him switch it off.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.381
"Turn left, turn right."
She never lets up.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.483
Yeah, sounds like
my mother-in-law.

33:39.551 --> 33:40.617
Are you guys hungry?

33:40.652 --> 33:41.585
I'm happy to make you brunch.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.486
I'm starving.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.154
Great!

33:44.223 --> 33:45.222
Here you are.

33:49.995 --> 33:50.927
This is so sweet.

33:50.963 --> 33:51.895
Yeah.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.800
Red velvet pancakes, no less!
You should be a chef.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.668
I kind of am.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.137
I sort of thinks of this
as my little restaurant...

34:00.172 --> 34:01.238
With beds.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.473
Where did you work before?

34:03.509 --> 34:04.441
Chef Oliver's gourmet catering.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.009
It's in greenwich.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.944
He was a perfectionist,

34:07.980 --> 34:10.313
but I certainly got
a four-star education.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.815
So where is this "Emily"?
Will she be joining us?

34:12.851 --> 34:14.951
Only in spirit.

34:14.987 --> 34:17.353
She passed away,
and I inherited the house...

34:17.422 --> 34:18.855
Me and my fiance, Brian.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.257
Where is he?

34:20.292 --> 34:22.092
He's on his way to wall street.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.261
Well, I have to ask...

34:24.295 --> 34:25.962
Where's a good place
to go antiquing?

34:25.998 --> 34:28.632
There's a great little
shop here right in danfield,

34:28.667 --> 34:29.666
and there are plenty of others
in doylestown.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.201
Great.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.103
Well, this breakfast
looks amazing.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.371
Looks like we picked
the right place.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.639
Thank you so much.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.507
Enjoy!

34:47.018 --> 34:51.487
This merger would benefit
both sides equally.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.824
Except for next year's
projected revenue.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.293
I mean, yeah, of course,
you can look at the numbers,

34:56.328 --> 34:57.861
or you can look
at the big picture.

34:57.896 --> 34:58.829
Which is?

35:00.399 --> 35:02.999
Which is, the fundamentals
and the technical analysis

35:03.035 --> 35:05.702
both show that
this sector has momentum.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.204
This is at its peak
before the fall

35:07.239 --> 35:09.206
if you sit
on this opportunity.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.507
The time to act is now...

35:12.177 --> 35:13.844
While you have
the market's attention.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.049
Looks like
we're getting closer to a deal.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.086
Come in.

35:23.155 --> 35:26.857
I am so glad you chose
Emily's Country Inn, Mr. Albert.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.558
Mitchell, please.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.994
I'll bring some fresh
towels to your room.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.262
Okay.
that would be fine.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.264
Okay, we'll be in touch.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.769
I think we'll be able to
wrap this up pretty soon.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.505
I'm working
on a new acquisition.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.273
I'd like you
to consult on that as well.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.508
That is
a great idea.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.909
Nobody bottom-lines
the numbers

35:45.944 --> 35:47.544
as persuasively
as Brian.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.880
I appreciate that, Harry.
It would be an honor.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.181
Now, I'm late
for a 1:00.

35:51.216 --> 35:52.782
I'll call you guys later.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.084
Sounds good.
Thanks, Roger.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.385
All right,

35:55.420 --> 35:56.086
let's get you caught up
on the Peterson deal.

35:56.121 --> 35:57.053
Yeah.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.423
Hey, look, I know
Bailey can be demanding,

36:00.459 --> 36:01.458
but he's a good guy.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.059
It has nothing
to do with him.

36:03.095 --> 36:04.394
Fact of the matter is,

36:04.429 --> 36:05.762
what am I going
to tell Jenny?

36:05.797 --> 36:07.731
We're only talking
about another week or two here,

36:07.766 --> 36:10.066
and everybody in the office
commutes from Connecticut,

36:10.102 --> 36:11.768
or wherever.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.171
You can commute
from bucks county.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.006
Slay the markets
during the day,

36:16.041 --> 36:17.007
and tend your goats
at night...

36:17.042 --> 36:18.041
You done?

36:18.076 --> 36:19.676
Yeah, let's get this.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.844
Why don't we go
in your massive office

36:20.879 --> 36:22.279
and get me the Peterson deal.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.385
Honey?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.419
Jenny?

36:29.454 --> 36:30.554
Hey! how are you?

36:30.589 --> 36:31.555
I'm good.
I've got to get to Casey's

36:31.590 --> 36:33.223
and start baking.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.192
Listen,
before you go,

36:35.227 --> 36:38.128
I think there's something
you and I should discuss.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.129
No.
is it good or bad?

36:40.465 --> 36:42.065
It depends
on how you look at it, really.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.369
Roger Bailey...

36:47.806 --> 36:49.206
Asked me to help him
close another deal.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.941
That's amazing! Congratulations.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.809
I know.
It's not going to take long,

36:52.878 --> 36:53.810
and I can commute back
every night.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.412
It'll be easy.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.780
It's great.

36:56.815 --> 36:57.747
You're okay with it, right?

36:57.783 --> 36:59.449
Yeah.

36:59.484 --> 37:00.750
Honey, listen to me.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.419
My life is here.
It's going to be fine.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.386
This is just a way
to make a quick buck.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.288
I just miss you, but...

37:05.324 --> 37:06.323
That's awesome.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.224
I've got to get
going, though.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.494
Can you bring me back

37:11.563 --> 37:12.662
some of that
Jenny's home baked

37:12.731 --> 37:14.064
so I can eat it
on the train?

37:14.099 --> 37:15.165
Of course.

37:16.268 --> 37:18.001
I love you.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.915
It's okay.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.919
Bye!

37:42.961 --> 37:44.761
I have three guests!

37:44.796 --> 37:46.730
Congratulations.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.098
I finished these
last night.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.566
I just thought
I'd drop them off.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.767
Thank you so much, Alice.

37:50.802 --> 37:51.968
You know, you should stay
and eat something.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.103
I made enough for an army.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.071
If you insist.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.682
This is some spread
you put out.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.284
I'm so glad
you're enjoying it.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.685
Where's Brian?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.253
Will we meet
him today?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.855
He's...
he's just in the city,

38:11.923 --> 38:12.922
doing one more deal,

38:12.958 --> 38:13.790
and then
he'll be back for good.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.129
Well, I found
an antique lamp yesterday

38:19.164 --> 38:20.330
that's part of a pair,

38:20.365 --> 38:22.432
so I am determined
to find its mate. Hon'?

38:22.467 --> 38:23.667
I guess that's my cue.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.668
Happy hunting.

38:24.703 --> 38:25.769
Thank you.

38:25.804 --> 38:26.970
Good luck
finding that lamp.

38:27.005 --> 38:27.937
See you later.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.374
You know, Alice lives

38:31.443 --> 38:33.443
on that beautiful farm
just down the road.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.347
That's a very pretty
piece of land.

38:37.382 --> 38:38.848
I saw it when I drove by.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.618
When I was a pilot,
I traveled all the time.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.053
Now I just want
to land for good,

38:43.121 --> 38:45.155
and maybe do
a little bit of fishing.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.357
I have a boat
docked at the lake.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.192
More trout than you can count.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.194
Well, if that's an invitation,
I'd be delighted.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.536
Those pumpkin croissants
are a huge hit.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.705
I'm so glad.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.807
All right, well,
I'd better get back to the inn.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.108
Is everything okay?

39:05.143 --> 39:08.278
Yeah, yeah, no.
The guests are great.

39:08.313 --> 39:10.447
I just hardly ever see Brian.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.482
He's been back and forth
to the city all week.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.783
He spends
more time on the train

39:13.819 --> 39:14.951
than he does with me.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.886
That's just
temporary, right?

39:16.955 --> 39:17.987
Right.

39:18.023 --> 39:18.955
Yeah.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.327
You ladies let me know
when you're ready to order.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.062
-Thanks, Casey.
-Yeah, thank you.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.166
So what brings you
to bucks county?

39:30.202 --> 39:33.336
Research
for the "out-of-towner."

39:33.372 --> 39:35.238
I'm doing this series.

39:35.307 --> 39:36.873
Well, no,
it's more like a warning

39:36.908 --> 39:38.875
about all these new b&bs
that are popping up in the area.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.177
We do have
a ton of b&bs around here.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.245
I know.

39:42.314 --> 39:43.646
I've already tried
three of them.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.814
I was not impressed.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.816
Casey, do you know
any good b&bs?

39:46.852 --> 39:48.985
Yeah, I know a great one.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.687
It's brand-new,
and the food is terrific.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.422
Really?
which one is that?

39:52.491 --> 39:54.090
It's called
Emily's Country Inn.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.093
Emily's inn...

39:57.162 --> 39:58.695
Maybe you should check it out.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.597
Yeah, maybe.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.068
Do you know
where we could find a latte?

40:05.103 --> 40:06.336
Hi, Harry.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.671
Listen, tell him to run
the numbers again, okay?

40:08.707 --> 40:10.106
Because I know
I'm right.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.408
All right, I'm on my way.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.876
Are you okay?

40:12.911 --> 40:13.943
No, no, listen, this deal
is in danger of falling apart.

40:14.012 --> 40:14.911
I've got to go.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.513
Okay.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.447
I miss you.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.216
I miss us.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.285
I miss you, too.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.035
Not now!

40:48.113 --> 40:49.112
What happened?

40:52.451 --> 40:55.151
Emily's Country Inn
just blew a fuse.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.791
Who needs electricity
on a night like tonight?

41:01.827 --> 41:05.462
I've never seen so many stars.

41:05.630 --> 41:06.830
That's the beauty
of getting out of town.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.098
What did you do to these?

41:09.134 --> 41:12.735
Those s'mores
have cognac and Cranberries

41:12.771 --> 41:14.571
and a little bit
of almond extract.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.473
Gourmet s'mores.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.241
Where's Brian?

41:20.178 --> 41:21.578
He had to work late.

41:22.948 --> 41:23.947
How could you miss
a night like this?

41:37.662 --> 41:40.196
Man.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.232
Tommy came over,
and he checked it out,

41:42.267 --> 41:44.167
and said that three guests
was just more

41:44.236 --> 41:45.435
than the worn-out wiring
could handle.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.237
Okay, fine.
So then, what do we do?

41:47.272 --> 41:49.405
He said the whole house
needs to be rewired.

41:49.441 --> 41:50.573
Honey, the whole house?

41:52.644 --> 41:54.477
All right, well,
what about our guests?

41:54.513 --> 41:57.981
I've given them candles
and lanterns in their rooms.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.315
I don't know,

41:59.351 --> 42:00.016
I feel like we're spending
more money on the b&b

42:00.085 --> 42:01.084
than we're making.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.119
It's... let me just...
It's fine.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.587
Look, honey...

42:04.623 --> 42:05.822
I'm going to make enough money
on this job with Harry.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.525
I'll put the lights back on.
I just...

42:08.593 --> 42:10.093
The whole house, I mean...

42:10.128 --> 42:12.996
I guess I should wave you off
with more enthusiasm, then.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.597
No...

42:14.633 --> 42:16.132
But I will settle for a kiss
once I get back.

42:19.471 --> 42:21.504
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.006
Could we just have
a few more candles for the room?

42:23.041 --> 42:24.007
Of course!
Absolutely.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.642
You must be Brian.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.143
Yes! hi.

42:27.178 --> 42:28.344
You know, you are
one lucky fella.

42:28.380 --> 42:29.712
She's an incredible cook.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.481
I am the luckiest man
in the world.

42:31.516 --> 42:32.782
Thank you
for being so understanding.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.618
You know what?
I actually enjoy this.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.620
Wade isn't reading
or watching TV,

42:37.656 --> 42:39.389
so we're actually talking
to each other.

42:39.457 --> 42:41.357
Turns out
we have a lot to say.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.493
Anyway,
you two, carry on.

42:49.801 --> 42:50.800
I'm so happy
you're home.

42:50.835 --> 42:52.235
Me too, baby.
Come here.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.548
Hey, hand me
those needle-nose pliers.

43:05.584 --> 43:06.416
This one?

43:06.484 --> 43:08.051
Yep.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.519
Stupid name for pliers.

43:11.156 --> 43:12.322
You know,
this is my first day off

43:12.357 --> 43:13.389
since I went back
to wall street.

43:13.425 --> 43:14.724
Is that what you did?

43:14.759 --> 43:15.658
Only temporarily.

43:17.062 --> 43:18.661
Enough with
the knowing looks, Tommy.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.830
Jenny and I are doing just fine,
thank you.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.498
You still've got that picture
of your 'kids' on your phone?

43:30.742 --> 43:32.375
I'm the same guy, Tommy.

43:32.410 --> 43:33.676
I'm just wearing a suit
to make a buck.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.011
Well...

43:35.046 --> 43:36.512
Don't let the suit
define the man?

43:38.850 --> 43:39.782
You know,
if you weren't so tall,

43:39.851 --> 43:40.783
I could afford to be offended.

43:43.722 --> 43:45.421
<i>Hello?</i>

43:45.457 --> 43:48.224
Is this... Emily's inn, or...?

43:48.259 --> 43:50.560
<i>W-would you like a room?
Although I should warn you,</i>

43:50.595 --> 43:52.595
we don't have any electricity
right now.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.400
Okay, well, do you think the inn
will be fully-functional soon?

43:57.435 --> 43:58.534
It better be,

43:58.570 --> 43:59.535
'cause I'm running
out of candles.

43:59.571 --> 44:01.237
<i>Yes,</i>

44:01.272 --> 44:03.806
<i>I am hoping that everything
will be fixed by tomorrow.</i>

44:03.875 --> 44:04.707
Would you like
to make a reservation?

44:04.743 --> 44:06.409
Okay.

44:06.444 --> 44:07.777
Is it just for yourself?

44:07.812 --> 44:09.045
<i>Yes.</i>

44:09.080 --> 44:10.480
Okay,
and when will you be arriving?

44:10.548 --> 44:11.714
Next Tuesday.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.983
You can put it under...
Denise.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.885
Denise.
okay, great, we'll see you then.

44:18.556 --> 44:20.957
She's clearly an amateur.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.294
How's everything at the inn?

44:25.330 --> 44:26.429
Good.

44:26.464 --> 44:27.697
Nora and Wade
are about to check out.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.565
I got another booking.

44:29.601 --> 44:31.601
I just have
to keep those rooms rented.

44:33.304 --> 44:35.071
You know, I kind of feel like...

44:35.106 --> 44:36.239
Kind of feel
like our money problems

44:36.274 --> 44:38.541
have forced Brian
back to wall street.

44:38.576 --> 44:39.742
That's not what I want.

44:39.778 --> 44:41.077
What does he want?

44:44.049 --> 44:45.748
I don't know.

44:52.657 --> 44:54.223
Hi.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.993
Goodness...

45:00.732 --> 45:03.232
This view is so much better
with you beside me.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.372
Man...
I've got to tell you, Jenny,

45:09.407 --> 45:12.809
I was up all night
monitoring the markets.

45:12.844 --> 45:15.044
I've been falling asleep
on the train.

45:16.915 --> 45:17.980
Jenny, I don't know,

45:18.016 --> 45:18.848
but this commute's
taking a toll,

45:18.883 --> 45:21.150
so...

45:21.186 --> 45:22.351
I thought I'd talk to Harry

45:22.387 --> 45:23.386
and see if maybe
I could stay at his place...

45:23.421 --> 45:24.387
You know, just the week.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.522
What do you think?

45:26.558 --> 45:27.557
I understand.

45:27.592 --> 45:28.925
Do you?

45:30.028 --> 45:30.927
Yeah.

45:33.164 --> 45:34.230
Okay. thank you.

45:35.433 --> 45:37.100
Heck.

45:39.571 --> 45:41.904
I'm going to be...
I'm going to miss my train.

45:41.940 --> 45:42.905
I will call you later.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.373
Okay?

45:51.449 --> 45:54.851
It's not forever, you know.

45:54.886 --> 45:55.718
I'll be home on the weekends.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.288
I'm okay with it.

46:13.905 --> 46:15.972
Well, I think
we're going to get going.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.607
You know
that little shop in doylestown?

46:17.642 --> 46:19.475
They're trying to find me
a matching lamp.

46:19.544 --> 46:20.643
They'll call me
when it comes in.

46:20.712 --> 46:21.911
Well,
I hope you'll stay here.

46:21.946 --> 46:23.212
Of course, we will!

46:23.248 --> 46:24.947
We've had
such a good time.

46:24.983 --> 46:26.983
Well, you are always welcome.

46:27.051 --> 46:27.984
We'll see you soon.

46:28.052 --> 46:29.619
All right, take care.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.389
Roger, I also factored
in all the variables

46:33.424 --> 46:36.058
and the impact
of currency fluctuations.

46:36.094 --> 46:37.827
<i>You got Peterson
back to the table.</i>

46:37.896 --> 46:40.263
He'd only leave Dallas
if he was ready to close.

46:40.298 --> 46:41.497
Good work, guys.
Really good work.

46:41.566 --> 46:43.299
<i>Thank you, Roger.</i>

46:43.334 --> 46:45.401
I made the right decision
getting you involved, Brian.

46:45.436 --> 46:46.302
Yeah, you did.

46:46.337 --> 46:47.403
Appreciate it, man.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.606
You, my friend,

46:50.642 --> 46:52.074
are making yourself
indispensable.

46:52.110 --> 46:52.909
What're you doing?
What're you doing? 'Kay.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.243
Hey...

46:54.279 --> 46:56.779
I've got an empty office
at the end of the hall.

46:56.815 --> 46:58.447
No, no, no, no, no.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.149
This is only supposed
to be temporary, Harry.

47:00.185 --> 47:01.284
I'm only providing a desk.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.585
The ambivalence,
that's all yours.

47:06.191 --> 47:07.490
Enjoy!

47:07.525 --> 47:09.125
I can almost guarantee
it's not as big as yours.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.359
Guaranteed.

47:14.332 --> 47:15.398
Hey, honey.

47:15.433 --> 47:18.000
Hey, I...
I just got a call.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.635
Are you okay?

47:19.671 --> 47:21.437
<i>My distributor was bought out
by another company,</i>

47:21.472 --> 47:23.606
and they may be dropping
Jenny's home baked.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.408
Okay, all right.
Just calm down.

47:25.443 --> 47:26.309
You'll find yourself
another distributor.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.443
It's fine.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.278
Yeah, but it took so long
to get that one.

47:30.615 --> 47:31.781
They want to have a meeting
to discuss the terms.

47:31.816 --> 47:32.849
What do you think?

47:32.917 --> 47:34.150
See, there you go.
They want to meet.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.117
That's a good sign, okay?

47:35.153 --> 47:37.520
Yeah, I hope so.

47:37.589 --> 47:38.521
I know
we really need this income.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.190
We'll be fine.

47:41.259 --> 47:42.925
<i>Keep your chin up.
I love you.</i>

47:51.469 --> 47:53.269
We distribute to supermarkets
and chain stores.

47:53.304 --> 47:55.671
We don't carry
many smaller start-ups like you.

47:55.707 --> 47:56.973
Our sales
are really starting to increase.

47:57.008 --> 47:58.641
You'll need
to step up production,

47:58.676 --> 47:59.642
which means
moving your operation

47:59.677 --> 48:00.643
to Pittsburgh,

48:00.678 --> 48:02.678
where we have a plant.

48:02.714 --> 48:05.615
But... I think bucks county
is a much better fit

48:05.650 --> 48:06.649
for Jenny's home baked.

48:06.684 --> 48:08.718
The personal association
with the brand

48:08.786 --> 48:09.819
is of limited use.

48:09.854 --> 48:11.854
It's not just
a marketing ploy.

48:11.890 --> 48:13.856
We can get you into more stores

48:13.892 --> 48:16.058
if you use cheaper ingredients
to cut down costs.

48:17.495 --> 48:18.628
It's quantity over quaint
in the outlets that we serve.

48:20.665 --> 48:22.198
So what do you think?

48:22.233 --> 48:26.636
I think you're confusing
"quaint" with quality.

48:28.539 --> 48:29.672
I want to make something
I'm proud of.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.375
Well, let me know
how that works out.

48:40.518 --> 48:42.551
Jenny lost her distributor.

48:42.587 --> 48:43.886
No.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.554
Big financial blow, Harry.

48:45.590 --> 48:46.889
At least we have the inn.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.257
Well, and you've
got this job.

48:48.326 --> 48:49.225
Yeah, which is why I've got
to get up to the office.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.226
I've got a lot of work to do.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.527
Listen, have you
talked to Roger

48:51.562 --> 48:52.695
about that meeting
we're supposed to be lining up?

48:52.730 --> 48:53.396
Yeah, I have.
It's all coming together.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.497
Good, 'cause I mean,

48:54.532 --> 48:55.498
we've got to nail
this down, buddy.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.074
Hi!

49:05.109 --> 49:06.008
You must be Denise.

49:06.044 --> 49:06.943
Yes.

49:07.011 --> 49:09.078
Welcome to Emily's Country Inn!

49:09.113 --> 49:10.513
Thank you.

49:10.548 --> 49:12.114
Come on up.
I'll show you to your room.

49:12.183 --> 49:13.916
We're so happy you're here.

49:13.952 --> 49:15.051
Okay, I...

49:17.221 --> 49:18.354
Okay.

49:20.758 --> 49:21.924
Two-story craftsman house.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.962
The room is rather small.

49:26.030 --> 49:27.730
It's adequately furnished.

49:27.765 --> 49:29.932
The bathroom's down the hall.

49:29.968 --> 49:33.602
It's an average view,
just a barn and so on.

49:38.409 --> 49:39.608
Just in case
you want to take a shower.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.477
I should warn you, though...

49:41.546 --> 49:42.778
The plumbing
is a little...

49:42.814 --> 49:43.779
Musical.

49:43.815 --> 49:45.381
Is that so?

49:45.416 --> 49:46.949
Yeah, but it works
totally fine.

49:48.052 --> 49:49.051
Anything else?

49:49.087 --> 49:50.953
How do you take your coffee?

49:50.989 --> 49:51.988
I prefer tea.

49:52.056 --> 49:53.422
Tea.
got it, great.

49:53.458 --> 49:54.924
I'll see you downstairs.

50:03.201 --> 50:04.700
Emily's inn is a bust.

50:06.738 --> 50:08.471
It's a very small chair.

50:13.211 --> 50:14.377
There you go.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.281
So...
all of this food is just for me?

50:19.317 --> 50:21.317
Well,
my other guest is out fishing.

50:21.386 --> 50:23.152
My friend, Tommy, may join us,

50:23.221 --> 50:24.954
but he's actually trying
to fix the electrical outlets.

50:24.989 --> 50:25.988
Well.

50:26.057 --> 50:27.056
That smells so good.

50:28.726 --> 50:29.992
Please,
have a seat.

50:30.061 --> 50:31.727
Tommy,
this is Denise.

50:33.464 --> 50:34.397
Hello.

50:34.432 --> 50:35.564
Hi.

50:41.806 --> 50:42.671
I eat
based on height and weight.

50:43.975 --> 50:46.142
You should try
the blueberry scones.

50:46.177 --> 50:47.443
Okay.

50:50.915 --> 50:51.781
Incredible, right?

50:52.817 --> 50:53.849
It's delicious.

50:53.918 --> 50:55.951
Just wait
until you try the crepes.

50:59.257 --> 51:00.990
This is...
This is very good.

51:02.126 --> 51:03.259
You came to the right place.

51:07.498 --> 51:08.931
I can run the inn

51:08.966 --> 51:10.800
and keep
Jenny's home baked afloat.

51:10.835 --> 51:12.768
You know that coffee-shop chain,
creamacinos?

51:12.804 --> 51:15.004
That would be an
ideal vendor for me.

51:15.039 --> 51:16.472
Yeah, I've been
to the one in Warwick.

51:16.507 --> 51:18.674
I could do an entire line
of cappuccino-flavored pastries.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.675
I've been experimenting
with cupcakes and croissants

51:19.710 --> 51:20.810
all day.

51:20.845 --> 51:21.877
How much cappuccino
have you had?

51:21.946 --> 51:23.112
I had to taste
everything I baked.

51:23.147 --> 51:24.647
Why, do you not think
this is a good idea?

51:24.682 --> 51:26.115
Is this the caffeine talking,
or is this a good idea?

51:26.150 --> 51:27.850
No, it's a good idea.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.018
Okay.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.553
Whatever it is,

51:30.621 --> 51:31.720
it beats me sitting around,
waiting for the phone to ring.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.856
You could always call Brian.

51:36.194 --> 51:37.526
I'm not the one who went away.

51:48.539 --> 51:49.638
You still at it?

51:51.476 --> 51:52.575
Hey, did you know

51:52.643 --> 51:54.643
the nikkei and the Dax
are both way up?

51:56.080 --> 51:58.047
Come on, Harry.
Could play in our favor.

51:58.082 --> 51:59.148
You want a beer?

51:59.183 --> 52:00.416
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Thanks.

52:05.857 --> 52:07.223
You know,

52:07.258 --> 52:08.257
you don't really look like a guy

52:08.326 --> 52:11.227
who's about to walk away
from all this.

52:11.262 --> 52:12.928
You know...

52:15.066 --> 52:16.499
The truth?

52:17.768 --> 52:19.401
I'm confused.

52:19.437 --> 52:22.171
Confused is better
than deceiving yourself.

52:24.275 --> 52:25.674
Cheers.

52:27.211 --> 52:28.277
You know, I've got
a briefcase in one hand,

52:28.346 --> 52:30.546
and I've got a toolbox
in the other.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.616
There's a metaphor
you don't hear very often.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.584
That's not a metaphor.

52:35.620 --> 52:36.719
It's my reality.

52:36.754 --> 52:39.221
I say this with
all due respect to Jenny,

52:39.257 --> 52:40.523
who you know
I like very much.

52:42.226 --> 52:43.592
I don't see you
living in the sticks.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.463
I don't want to lose her, Harry.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.532
This guy, the one that
belongs on wall street?

52:49.567 --> 52:51.700
That's not the guy
she fell in love with, Harry.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.602
What if this is
who you really are?

52:53.671 --> 52:55.704
You can't change
for someone else.

52:55.740 --> 52:56.705
That never works.

52:56.741 --> 52:58.707
Trust me, I've tried.

52:58.743 --> 52:59.909
Just ask my ex-wife.

52:59.944 --> 53:01.577
I'd rather not.

53:03.514 --> 53:05.581
I don't know, I...

53:05.616 --> 53:07.349
I don't know.
I just don't know what to do.

53:07.385 --> 53:09.919
It may not entirely be
up to you.

53:11.589 --> 53:14.023
Jenny may have
doubts of her own.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.331
I can taste the cappuccino.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.632
Good.

53:23.668 --> 53:25.734
I'm taking all my samples
to their flagship store.

53:27.505 --> 53:29.038
When will,
Brian be back?

53:30.308 --> 53:32.308
Hopefully, the weekend.

53:32.343 --> 53:33.375
He's under a lot of pressure
at work,

53:33.411 --> 53:34.476
so I try not to ask.

53:34.512 --> 53:36.178
Maybe you should go see him.

53:36.214 --> 53:37.413
The trains go both ways.

53:37.481 --> 53:39.381
Yeah, but he's busy,
and I'm busy here.

53:39.417 --> 53:40.516
I can't just leave the inn.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.151
At least let him know
how you feel.

53:42.186 --> 53:44.186
Casey, I don't know how I feel.

53:44.222 --> 53:45.854
I...

53:45.890 --> 53:47.423
He's changing.

53:47.491 --> 53:49.725
I just feel like we're being
pulled in separate directions.

53:49.760 --> 53:53.929
Maybe he was trying to be
who you wanted him to be.

53:53.998 --> 53:56.899
It's what I've done with
everyone I've ever dated,

53:56.934 --> 53:58.200
which is why I'm still single.

54:01.672 --> 54:02.938
It's Brian.

54:04.942 --> 54:06.609
Hi.

54:06.677 --> 54:07.376
<i>Listen, I hope
I'm not calling too late.</i>

54:07.411 --> 54:08.444
Is everything okay?

54:08.512 --> 54:10.412
No, it's not, Jenny.

54:10.448 --> 54:11.447
I miss you.

54:13.284 --> 54:14.250
I miss you.

54:14.285 --> 54:15.551
And I love you.

54:17.088 --> 54:18.087
Did I mention that?

54:18.122 --> 54:19.755
Not recently.

54:19.790 --> 54:22.091
<i>Well, I do.</i>

54:22.126 --> 54:23.459
I love you, too.

54:26.230 --> 54:27.863
That's really just
all I wanted to say.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.366
That's enough.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.067
Can I call you in the morning
and say it again?

54:32.103 --> 54:33.702
I'd like that.

54:33.738 --> 54:35.571
<i>I'll see you tomorrow night.</i>

54:39.610 --> 54:41.076
You've got to hand
it to the guy...

54:41.112 --> 54:42.111
His timing is great.

54:44.915 --> 54:46.749
Yeah.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.717
He's great.

54:52.456 --> 54:53.422
Brian!

54:53.457 --> 54:54.790
Yeah.

54:54.825 --> 54:56.125
I just scored us an
invitation to Bailey's party.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.826
Strictly a
power-player affair.

54:57.895 --> 54:58.927
Are you serious?

54:58.963 --> 54:59.895
Yes, sir.

54:59.930 --> 55:01.664
Dude, nice work, buddy!

55:01.732 --> 55:03.098
Hey, listen, do you think
my old boss will be there?

55:03.134 --> 55:05.567
I mean, I could use
some professional vindication

55:05.603 --> 55:06.735
being fired for his mistakes.

55:06.771 --> 55:08.237
He'll probably show up.

55:08.272 --> 55:09.805
Bailey's parties
are a networking paradise.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.906
That's awesome.

55:10.941 --> 55:11.907
Listen,
I just want to thank you.

55:11.942 --> 55:13.809
Hey, if it wasn't for you,

55:13.844 --> 55:14.643
I wouldn't be able
to redeem myself on the street.

55:14.679 --> 55:15.744
It means a lot.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.413
-Evening, gentlemen.
-Hello, sir.

55:17.448 --> 55:19.615
Brian, I assume
you're coming to the party.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.084
Absolutely.
wouldn't miss it.

55:22.119 --> 55:23.585
Good.
bring your fiancee.

55:23.621 --> 55:25.254
My wife was very impressed
with those muffins.

55:25.289 --> 55:28.023
I will let her know... yes.

55:28.092 --> 55:29.024
You're becoming
quite an asset, Brian.

55:31.028 --> 55:32.594
I've got to get home.

55:32.630 --> 55:33.996
Later.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.137
Good morning.

55:42.173 --> 55:44.606
Wish you didn't have to leave
so soon.

55:44.642 --> 55:47.109
I know, honey, me too,
but I've got to get back.

55:47.144 --> 55:48.243
There's some issue

55:48.279 --> 55:49.611
with the final draft
of the proposal.

55:49.647 --> 55:51.180
I mean, the deal is close
to closing and everything,

55:51.248 --> 55:52.414
and you know how wall street is.
They're just...

55:52.450 --> 55:54.283
Actually, I...
I don't know.

55:54.318 --> 55:55.617
Well, you know,

55:55.653 --> 55:58.620
I mean, there's always
this social component, right?

55:58.656 --> 56:00.622
I mean, there's golfing,
there's lunches and parties...

56:02.259 --> 56:04.159
You know, I mean...

56:05.996 --> 56:07.863
Look, okay...

56:09.967 --> 56:11.033
Roger's throwing this party

56:11.102 --> 56:12.267
after work on Friday night,
all right,

56:12.303 --> 56:14.169
and it is a very big deal
to even get invited.

56:14.205 --> 56:15.371
Now, I know you're busy...

56:16.807 --> 56:17.639
But I'd really like you to come.

56:18.976 --> 56:20.943
I'd like that,
but I have guests.

56:20.978 --> 56:21.977
I can't just leave the inn.

56:22.012 --> 56:23.345
It's a cocktail party.

56:23.381 --> 56:25.514
You won't even be late
getting back, honey...

56:25.549 --> 56:27.049
And Alice, I mean, maybe
she could pinch-hit for you.

56:27.118 --> 56:28.784
Okay, I'll think about it.

56:28.819 --> 56:29.651
Just let me think about it.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.020
Okay.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.822
I love you.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.057
You too.

56:37.161 --> 56:38.560
Wish me luck.
Let's close this thing, okay?

56:38.629 --> 56:39.528
Good luck.
Be careful.

56:39.563 --> 56:40.362
You got it.

56:48.706 --> 56:51.640
I could use another lamp
in my room,

56:51.675 --> 56:53.976
but there's only one outlet.

56:54.011 --> 56:55.344
Okay, I'll ask
Tommy to install one.

56:56.981 --> 56:58.147
Okay, good.

56:58.182 --> 56:59.181
Thanks.

56:59.216 --> 57:00.983
Sure, no problem.

57:01.018 --> 57:04.753
Is he...
An electrician?

57:04.822 --> 57:06.255
Well,
he owns the general store,

57:06.323 --> 57:08.590
so he kind of just does
everything.

57:08.659 --> 57:09.858
Honestly, this house
would fall over

57:09.894 --> 57:10.759
if it wasn't for him.

57:13.030 --> 57:14.863
Is he responsible
for the musical plumbing?

57:14.899 --> 57:16.899
No, that would be
Brian's fault.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.367
He's my fiance.

57:18.402 --> 57:19.868
He'll be here tomorrow.
You'll get to meet him.

57:19.904 --> 57:21.437
Okay.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.605
Bye.

57:25.409 --> 57:27.242
You know, two outlets
would be better,

57:27.278 --> 57:28.911
just because people need
to charge their phones.

57:30.281 --> 57:31.346
Sure.

57:31.382 --> 57:32.714
Yeah, I'll ask Tommy.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.249
Great. okay.

57:38.055 --> 57:42.257
Mitchell and I
go fishing every day,

57:42.293 --> 57:43.759
then I make him dinner.

57:46.130 --> 57:49.264
It's been a long time
since I cared for anyone.

57:50.468 --> 57:52.568
Alice, he seems
like a really nice guy.

57:52.603 --> 57:53.936
He is.

57:53.971 --> 57:57.473
And he actually asked me
if he could extend his stay...

57:57.541 --> 57:58.607
I think because of you.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.247
What's going on
with you and Brian?

58:06.550 --> 58:07.616
I don't know.

58:07.651 --> 58:08.584
He wants me to go
to this cocktail party

58:08.619 --> 58:09.785
in the city,

58:09.820 --> 58:12.287
and I'm just so busy, and...
I don't know.

58:12.323 --> 58:14.223
It does kind of seem
important to him, though.

58:14.258 --> 58:15.591
Well then, you should go.

58:15.626 --> 58:17.159
Yeah, but it's
a park Avenue penthouse

58:17.228 --> 58:19.061
and this wall street crowd.

58:19.096 --> 58:20.729
It's not really my style.

58:20.764 --> 58:21.697
It's a party.

58:21.732 --> 58:24.566
Go have fun.

58:24.602 --> 58:26.802
Maybe that would help you
understand that part of him.

58:29.273 --> 58:31.240
Well,
guess I'm going to New York.

58:41.452 --> 58:43.252
You look very nice.

58:43.287 --> 58:44.987
Thank you.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.256
Okay, so I've left a ton of food
in the refrigerator.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.123
Are you sure you're
going to be okay?

58:48.158 --> 58:49.658
You bet.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.260
Alice should be here
any time.

58:51.295 --> 58:52.661
We're going to be watching
a movie together.

58:52.730 --> 58:54.062
Thank you
for holding down the fort.

58:54.098 --> 58:55.230
I'm becoming

58:55.266 --> 58:58.967
kind of a permanent fixture
around here.

58:59.003 --> 59:01.603
Alice and I are turning into...

59:01.639 --> 59:02.771
A lot more than I ever expected.

59:04.775 --> 59:06.074
Well, you're a great guest.

59:06.110 --> 59:07.276
I mean, if I had my way,
you'd never leave.

59:08.579 --> 59:09.444
I'm going to grab
more of those scones.

59:09.480 --> 59:10.913
Right.

59:10.948 --> 59:11.914
You have a good evening.

59:11.949 --> 59:13.448
Thank you.

59:13.484 --> 59:16.485
So... there was hardly
enough light

59:16.520 --> 59:17.819
to read last night.

59:17.855 --> 59:20.155
Yes, I'm so sorry.
Tommy just got here to fix it.

59:20.190 --> 59:21.423
Are you going somewhere?

59:21.458 --> 59:22.324
Yeah, I'm just driving
into Manhattan.

59:22.359 --> 59:23.492
I'll be back tonight.

59:23.527 --> 59:25.928
So you're leaving
your guests unattended?

59:25.963 --> 59:27.462
Yes, but my friend, Alice,
will be here.

59:27.498 --> 59:28.797
Alice?

59:28.832 --> 59:30.132
She's great.

59:30.167 --> 59:32.000
Hello, ladies.

59:32.036 --> 59:33.201
Are you off
to the city?

59:33.270 --> 59:35.804
Yes, that...
That was the plan.

59:35.839 --> 59:37.105
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

59:37.141 --> 59:39.641
I'll be around
if you need anything.

59:39.677 --> 59:41.143
I guess...

59:42.680 --> 59:45.147
Yeah, that'll be okay.

59:45.182 --> 59:46.214
Okay. s

59:52.656 --> 59:54.156
let's see about putting
that outlet in your room?

59:54.191 --> 59:56.058
Yeah.

59:56.093 --> 59:58.093
Two...
if it's not too much trouble.

59:58.162 --> 59:59.261
No trouble at all.

59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.228
Okay.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.332
It's just a chair.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:06.234
So it's my room.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:22.818
Hi. I'm looking
for Brian howell.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:23.819
And you are?

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:24.920
Jenny fintley.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.455
Yes,
Brian's expecting you.

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:27.356
His office
is right up the stairs.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.924
His office?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.025
Second door
on the left.

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:31.193
Great. thanks.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:42.704
You're here!

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:45.307
Hi!

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.875
Look at you!
You look so gorgeous.

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:48.276
Thank you.

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:50.512
I didn't know
you had an office.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:52.280
This is so nice.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.215
Yeah, I mean, come on,
it's just temporary

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.516
until we close this deal.

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.818
I am so happy
to see you.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:01:00.155
It was worth the trip
to see your smile.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.957
Jenny!

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:02.691
You made it.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.526
Hi!

01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:06.862
You look lovely,
as always.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:07.929
Thank you.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.032
Is that...
Is that new?

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.601
This is new.

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:13.935
What do you think?
I'm trying to look important.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.375
No? it's too much.
It's too much, isn't it?

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:23.545
Yeah, it looks
like I'm trying too hard.

01:01:23.614 --> 01:01:24.479
I am.
I am trying way too hard.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.116
I am going
to go home and change,

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:29.985
and I'll see you kids
at the party.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:35.724
Is this an audition,
or a party?

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.960
No, this is a night out
together in the city.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.362
Okay?

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:48.570
This is what I guess
real money buys you.

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:50.238
Look at that view.

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:52.908
-It's beautiful...
-Brian?

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:54.376
Yes?

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:56.144
I thought that was you.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.312
Hi, Howard.

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:59.014
I heard you were
back in the game.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.048
I'm pleased for you.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.517
You must miss him,
Howard.

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.720
With Brian, I always know
I'm in excellent hands.

01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:09.991
It's good seeing you again.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:14.396
Thank you, Roger.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.164
Welcome.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.899
Jenny,
let me get Laura.

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:18.867
I know
she'd love to see you.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:20.235
Great.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.203
I'll be right back.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.371
That's...

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:24.773
Howard, my old
"legendary" boss.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.274
Wait, the one
who fired you?

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.442
Yes, the one who fired me.

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.777
Thanks for reminding me.
I appreciate that.

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:31.046
I am so glad
you could join us. Hi!

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.181
You make
the best muffins I ever ate.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.250
That's very nice of you to say.

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:36.718
Excuse me.

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:38.220
Brian, why don't we go
grease the wheels

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.254
on this Peterson deal?

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.424
I'll be right back, okay?

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:43.558
Excuse me.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:44.593
All right, babe.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:45.594
Have fun.

01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:47.095
Thank you.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.698
So Roger tells me

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:51.032
that you and Brian
have a little inn?

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.467
We do, in bucks county.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:55.570
That's
an awfully long commute.

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.239
You two should get
an apartment in the city.

01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:00.776
Duty calls.

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.244
Excuse me, Jenny.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.113
Sure.

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.086
That looks...
That looks really good.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.554
Can I try that?

01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:13.622
Of course.

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:19.594
I can actually taste
the tarragon.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.396
Sorry, I used to be a caterer.

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.298
How'd you graduate to guest?

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.267
It's a long story.

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:28.170
Honestly, I'd rather be
in your shoes tonight.

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:30.906
It's not exactly
my crowd.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:33.074
My feet are killing me.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:35.744
Good luck.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.917
I mean, look,

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:43.318
we've made our mistakes
in the past,

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:44.519
but that's behind us.

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:45.921
Nobody's perfect.

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:47.622
You don't want to work
with a team that's perfect.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.405
Come here.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.840
Come here...

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:17.018
You know...

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:18.587
Brian and I were
at the same party,

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:20.622
and we were
a million miles apart.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:23.091
It's me and Daryl
all over again.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:25.427
Except Brian makes you laugh.

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.929
He used to,
but he's never around anymore.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:32.100
Casey,
I think I have to...

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:33.301
I think I have to start thinking
about what happens

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:34.269
if we don't make it.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:35.871
What?

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.138
No, it won't come to that.

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.341
No, I've got to fend for myself.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.710
That's why this meeting
is so important.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:45.981
How do I look?
Do I look professional?

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.782
You look like
you mean business.

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:49.017
Good.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.652
Okay, I've got my samples.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:52.687
We are all set.

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:54.556
I even made a cupcake
with the logo in the frosting.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:56.157
I tried one.
They're delicious.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.627
Thanks.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.732
You certainly are persistent.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.233
That's a lot of calls
and emails.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:07.302
I hope I didn't overdo it.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.404
I'm afraid all I can give you
is 10 minutes.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.072
That's five more
than I'll need.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.674
Okay.
show me what you got.

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:13.875
All right,

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:16.511
this is a almond
and cappuccino croissant.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:28.089
You're not selling these
anywhere else?

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.058
No, I created that recipe
just for you.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.693
They'd only be sold here.

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:32.928
That's nice
how you did the label.

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:34.329
Thank you.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.664
It's white chocolate frosting.

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:36.831
I'm impressed.

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:39.701
Most of my suppliers
are big operations,

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:42.270
with cost and delivery
that I can depend on.

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:44.172
Those big operations,

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:45.607
they had to start
somewhere, right?

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:48.209
I mean, kind of like you.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.544
I'm just asking
for an opportunity

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:50.946
to prove myself.

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:51.880
I won't disappoint you.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.183
I'll start you in
three locations,

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:56.084
and we'll see how it goes.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.119
So we have a deal?

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.421
You had me at the cupcakes.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.789
Thank you.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:04.025
Thank you so much.

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:06.094
So they found
my matching lamp...

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.363
And maybe even a table
from the same estate.

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:09.698
That's great!
Well, your room is all ready.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.102
What a view.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.437
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.572
Just going to... catch
the dolphins' game.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:21.776
Where's Brian?

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:24.579
He's enjoying the view
in Manhattan.

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:27.148
You must miss him.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.984
I was hoping it didn't show.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.286
You should tell him.

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:37.625
Hey, it's me.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:38.693
<i>Listen, Peterson
had to go back to Dallas,</i>

01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:39.627
<i>so everything is in limbo.</i>

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.697
Including us.

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:44.399
Brian, we have to decide
what we're doing.

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:47.035
Okay.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.970
I know, and we will.

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.305
<i>But I think
we need to do it now.</i>

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:53.308
I miss you.
That's...

01:06:53.377 --> 01:06:54.209
That's all I needed to say.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.212
That's all I needed to hear.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.420
Hey, hey.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:08.823
I have got to go home
for a few days, Harry.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:11.926
And then what?

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.433
I don't know.

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:23.905
I, I really don't know.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.578
My cappuccino cupcakes
seem like they're a hit.

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.781
Yeah!
That's great.

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:34.616
And the inn
is filling up, and...

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.284
Yeah.
It's all good.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:37.786
You know, I just...

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:39.020
I picture things in my head,

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.523
and they're...
They're kind of coming true.

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:48.063
I never pictured
you being absent, though.

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:49.297
Honey, I know.

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.433
I mean, it's not something
I pictured either.

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:52.300
We've just got to work
through it right now.

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.870
Hold on.

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:56.971
It's Roger.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.906
I've got to take this, okay?

01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:58.973
Yeah.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:00.108
-You sure?
-Yeah, of course.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:01.109
Roger.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:03.545
Hey.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.146
Yeah, no,
I'm in bucks county.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:06.381
No, listen,
listen.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.315
Harry can handle
the meeting.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:08.616
Everything's going
to be fine.

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:10.418
Yeah, I just had to come
home for a few days.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:14.289
Great, I'll get
back to you.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:15.390
Thanks, Roger. Bye.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:20.662
Okay, sorry.
Where were we?

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.598
Brian, I feel like we're...

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:24.832
I feel like we're right
where we started

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.734
when we inherited the house.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.970
Your heart
is on wall street,

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:32.407
and Brian,
my heart's here.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.341
Honey, can't we just say
my heart's commuting?

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:36.444
I mean, I just...

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.946
Yeah,
but you're changing, Brian.

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:38.979
What?

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:40.682
Honey, I'm...

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.486
Okay, you know what?
Maybe, yeah.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.453
I admit that the pull
of who I used to be is strong.

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:47.522
I admit that,

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.524
but it's not just
for the money.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:50.992
You know,
it's for the energy of the city,

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:52.026
and the fact that I get a chance
to do what I love to do

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:53.528
and be good
at what I want to do.

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:54.496
No, I understand that.

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:55.596
Do you?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.663
Of course,
I understand that,

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.631
and I want you
to be honest with me.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:58.867
I am.

01:08:58.935 --> 01:08:59.801
We have to be honest
with each other,

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:01.970
no matter what.

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:04.139
Okay.

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:04.872
Then know this.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:08.977
I honestly love you...

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.779
And the rest of this, I'll...

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.048
Try to figure it out, okay?

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:15.683
I don't want to pressure you.

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:17.785
I know.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.154
You know, I want
to spend my life with you,

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:20.388
but...

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:23.591
I can't wait forever.

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:26.661
I know...

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:28.196
And you won't.

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:32.834
-Okay.
-okay. come here.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.042
So, Susan,
you decided to stay.

01:09:42.112 --> 01:09:44.112
I'm reviewing Emily's Inn.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:45.212
What do you think?

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:46.680
Meh, it's on par
with the other newbies...

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.783
Except for the food,
which is excellent.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.451
Hey! Denise.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:52.319
Hi.

01:09:53.657 --> 01:09:55.156
This is
my general store.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:57.492
Stop in and
say hello.

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:00.361
Maybe we could have lunch.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:01.296
If you have time.
I...

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.664
Yeah. yep.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:03.998
Yeah, I... I do.

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:05.166
Great.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:07.735
Well, I've got to run.

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:15.810
Bye.

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:20.181
Who's your friend?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.152
I...
I met him at the inn.

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:26.254
Why did he call you "Denise?"

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:28.389
Sometimes, I just...

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.857
I check in under
a false name,

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.026
just in case anyone
knows who I am.

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:34.329
Well, he's very good-looking.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.263
Yeah.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.765
And very tall.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.902
Maybe he'll end up
in your blog.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.704
Maybe.

01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:45.573
I just promised Jenny

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:48.576
I'd finish painting
the hallway.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.112
Are you going to be around
long enough to watch it dry?

01:10:51.181 --> 01:10:52.714
Better keep her happy,
or you'll turn into me.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.549
You pining for your ex?

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.418
I miss my dog,

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.754
and my big-screen TV...

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:02.190
But most of all,

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:04.692
I miss the way
she saw right through me.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:07.629
Sometimes, you don't know
how good you got it

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:08.730
'til you lose it.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.531
"A mechanic's guide to love."

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.600
Words to live by, guys.

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:13.434
He happens to be right.

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:18.273
Hey, Denise.

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:19.374
Hi!

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:20.408
I just...

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.277
I just came here
to get some push pins.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.478
Okay, that's fine.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:24.445
Jenny's probably got
them at the house.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.446
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:26.414
No, no, no.
That's okay.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.715
I'm going to get my own.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:29.751
Okay.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.052
Hi.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.920
Hi.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.322
Push pins, right?

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.958
Yeah.

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:38.926
There you are!

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:41.796
You're spoiling us, Jenny.

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:42.930
No.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.265
It's just 'cause
I want you to come back.

01:11:46.236 --> 01:11:47.935
You know, I don't know
about you guys,

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.170
but I don't think

01:11:49.239 --> 01:11:50.805
Jenny should limit herself
just to breakfast.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.508
I think this should be
a b&b&d...

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.109
Bed and breakfast and dinner.

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:56.077
What do you think?

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.078
Yes!

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:58.012
Well, I mean,

01:11:58.081 --> 01:11:59.247
that may not be practical,

01:11:59.282 --> 01:12:00.315
considering
both of you are gone so much.

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:04.085
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean,

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.186
I'm doing a little work
in the city.

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:06.654
It's only temporary.
Right, honey?

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.189
I hope.

01:12:08.258 --> 01:12:10.992
Well, I don't know how
you can beat bucks county.

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:12.827
I know, right?
I love it here.

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:14.595
I mean, I love it.

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:15.596
Don't you love it?

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:16.597
I do, I love it.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.833
I love it.

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.001
It's the most beautiful place
in the world...

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.635
I've got to take this call.
One second.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:23.738
Roger!
hey, man.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.840
Yeah, listen, I'm going
to have to call you back, okay?

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:26.808
Okay, thanks.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.142
Bye.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.179
Sorry.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.120
Well, the antiquing
around here, I mean,

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:40.088
it's incredible.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.089
Call him,
if you want to call him.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:42.290
It's fine.
No, he can wait.

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:43.458
It's not a big deal.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.460
What's going on?
Why is he calling so much?

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:46.928
Honey, we're doing
another deal together,

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:47.829
so, I mean, I owe him
a little bit of my time.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.297
You're doing another deal?

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:50.665
Yeah.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.532
That means
you're going to be gone

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:52.633
even more?

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:53.835
Why haven't you told me that?

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.370
Because it slipped
my... I'm sorry.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.338
-Slipped your mind?
-I'm telling you now.

01:12:57.374 --> 01:12:58.773
Look, you want me to apologize

01:12:58.808 --> 01:12:59.841
for trying to bring
more money in here?

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.476
No, I'm not asking
you to apologize,

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.643
but I shouldn't have
to apologize

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:03.845
for being upset
that you're never here.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.513
Never here?
I commute every single night!

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.681
Brian, we never see each other!
I miss you.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.015
We never see each other

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:09.517
because you're out
working on your...

01:13:13.623 --> 01:13:16.057
I'm...
I'm so sorry.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:18.626
You did not come here
to hear about our problems.

01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:19.394
Please enjoy
your breakfast.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.240
Excuse me.

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.020
Do you remember

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:48.022
when we couldn't agree
on a color for the house?

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:51.392
I don't know
what the compromise is

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:53.227
in this situation.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.597
I don't think you do, either.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.233
Jenny, look...

01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:00.168
We can figure this out.

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:05.006
We have so many memories here.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.208
What are you talking about?

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:09.710
It's no one's fault...

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.047
But...

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.349
We're just drifting apart.

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.092
What are you doing, Jenny?

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.231
This just makes me sad
right now.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:35.870
I think you should
hold onto it...

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:40.875
Until you know
what you really want.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:02.463
Hey, I am heading to Lucas's
for a drink.

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:03.965
You want to come with?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.099
No, man.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:07.001
I'm just going to stay
and work...

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.836
But you have fun.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:10.338
Anything I can do?

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:11.906
No, man, I'm good.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.641
You are good.
The best.

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:43.437
Hey, you ready
to dazzle them?

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.509
Yeah, sure.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.012
That's the spirit.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:57.552
How are you liking
your stay?

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:00.021
You need any help?

01:16:01.491 --> 01:16:03.658
I'm almost finished.
Thank you, though.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:08.729
How are you doing?

01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:12.066
I'm okay.

01:16:12.135 --> 01:16:14.168
Relationships aren't easy.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.637
No, they are not.

01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:18.005
You and Wade seem so happy.

01:16:19.509 --> 01:16:23.144
We've had
our ups and downs,

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.547
but this place,
it's good for us.

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:28.649
I'm glad to hear that.

01:16:28.685 --> 01:16:29.984
Can I help?

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:31.252
Thank you.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:35.523
All right.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:40.561
Breakfast
is served.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:43.664
There you are.
Sure.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.600
Jenny?

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:48.502
I'd like
to extend my stay again.

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:50.338
That is so great!
For how long?

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:52.239
Well, that'll depend on Alice.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.847
It's really been good for me
to be here.

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:04.518
You know, I...

01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:05.786
I didn't really think

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:08.723
that I would have
much to smile about today, so...

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.091
I just want to say thank you.
You guys have been great.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.927
I just have one question.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.929
Does that mean we get
another chocolate souffle?

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.300
You bet.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:20.768
We all know

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.470
this acquisition's going
to benefit everybody involved.

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:24.805
Right? the buyer, the seller,
the stockholder...

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.907
You guys don't need
my opinion.

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:28.576
Just look in the
proposal there, Harry.

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:30.311
Open it up.
Take a look at the numbers.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.413
Right?
I mean, that's why we're here.

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.614
Let's be honest with each other.

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:34.982
Because we're all
going to make money.

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:36.617
Sure, Brian.

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:38.486
Everyone'll make money.

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:40.588
I think what Brian means to say

01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:41.822
is that we have a very
good deal on the table.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:43.290
Is that
what you mean to say, Brian?

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.763
Roger, the deal is fine.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.398
I'm just not the guy to do it.

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:51.799
Not anymore.

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:54.902
You all right, Brian?

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:56.771
No, I'm not, Roger.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:00.908
I miss my goats.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.209
I miss my girl.

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:06.580
Not necessarily in that order.

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:07.982
I understand.

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:11.719
I'm sorry, Roger.

01:18:11.754 --> 01:18:14.555
I'm a family man, Brian.
I respect your choice.

01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:18.993
Good luck with the deal.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:20.227
Thank you.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:23.798
Harry.

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.099
Good luck with the girl.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:29.303
Thanks.

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:39.146
Hey, I speak goat, too!

01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:42.149
Yeah...

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:51.459
Hi.

01:19:05.675 --> 01:19:07.308
Are you sure
this is what you want?

01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:10.111
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.180
What I feel for you...

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:14.482
Is priceless.

01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:26.827
Welcome home.

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:36.203
Tommy asked me
to be his date tonight

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:38.506
and I have nothing to wear.

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.473
You're welcome
to borrow something of mine.

01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:42.076
I really like him.

01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:44.044
There's a lot of him to like.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.913
Yeah...

01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:48.549
Come on.
Come look.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:52.820
Did you...
Did you invite Rusty?

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.722
He invited himself.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:02.596
I'm a man of few words,
so...

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.233
Let me simply say...

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:14.341
I'm going to go
put the champagne on ice.

01:20:15.511 --> 01:20:17.545
I just...
I didn't have anything to wear,

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.013
so Jenny told me

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:20.214
that she could lend me
something,

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:21.515
and so I put it on,

01:20:21.551 --> 01:20:23.751
and I thought
that maybe I'd...!

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:28.789
I really like it here.

01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:38.165
Now, this is a grand opening.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.770
Hey, brother!
Thanks for having us.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.338
Thanks for coming.
We appreciate it.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:46.507
Jenny!

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:49.210
My date just revealed
her identity.

01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:52.279
Turns out her real name
is Susan Barry,

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:53.214
and she checked in
to review the inn.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.050
What?

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:58.085
She writes that travel blog,
"the out-of-towner."

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.053
I love your blog!

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:00.888
Thank you.

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:03.290
I didn't have time
to get you a present,

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:07.528
but I did write you
a five-star review.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:14.635
"The house is deceptively
ordinary at first.

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:17.872
It takes a while to discover
what a gem it really is.

01:21:17.907 --> 01:21:20.875
Emily's Country Inn
is a magical place,

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.376
and everyone lucky enough
to stay there

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:24.812
seems to find themselves
falling in love."

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:30.918
You know,
that's...

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.720
That's very true,

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:34.288
'cause,

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:35.322
Jenny and I were an unlikely bet

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:36.891
when we first arrived,
weren't we?

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.459
Yeah.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:39.960
Look at us now.

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:50.237
This is where I proposed to you
last time,

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:51.305
and this is where
I want to propose to you again.

01:21:54.644 --> 01:21:56.010
Jenny...

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:02.416
I want to make you laugh
the rest of your life.

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:05.986
Will you marry me?

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:07.988
Yes.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.627
I love you.

01:22:13.663 --> 01:22:15.029
To Brian and Jenny.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.298
And Emily,
who brought these two together.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:20.200
Tonight would have
made her very happy.

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:22.436
You know, Alice?
You're right.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.505
To Emily!

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:25.372
To Emily.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:26.707
Cheers, everybody.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.620
You look nice.

01:22:41.324 --> 01:22:43.390
It's Emily's Country Inn
and we're both single.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:44.692
I felt compelled to flirt.

01:22:46.696 --> 01:22:48.963
Anything is possible.

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:58.572
I just wanted a moment alone
with you.

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:01.041
Talk about a happy ending.

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:03.477
No...
