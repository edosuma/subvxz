13:43.065 --> 13:44.899
We've got genocide
going on in Rwanda.

13:44.965 --> 13:48.599
And we've got the
Kurdish factions routing
each other everyday.

13:48.665 --> 13:52.365
Of course,

give us updates, don't they?

on both sides of the door.

14:04.499 --> 14:07.065

witness was, didn't he?

14:11.599 --> 14:16.465
You could tell?
Well, only because
he clenched his hands.

14:16.532 --> 14:19.865
Most of the time,
that's the only way I can tell.
He makes these fists.

14:19.932 --> 14:22.832

14:26.999 --> 14:29.499
He had a slight stroke
about a year ago.

14:29.565 --> 14:33.232

on the memory part of the brain.

too concerned about reneging.

- What kind of lawyer are you?
- We're goin' into court.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.265
- We'll try to enforce
the agreement and then--
- Next time, I don't tell.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.732
That's the message here.
Don't tell.

15:14.865 --> 15:16.865
The thing is,
the salon closed.

15:16.932 --> 15:20.765
And the guy is kinda
judgment proof. So, suing him
wouldn't make much sense.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.632
But he's got this other,
uh, venture capital thing
going down,

15:23.699 --> 15:27.532

to give you stock options,
supposedly worth double.

15:27.599 --> 15:30.365
- All right.
- Good.

15:30.432 --> 15:32.665
Fine. Okay.

15:34.665 --> 15:37.599
Oh, uh, we'll wait out

- Mr. Berluti, it's-- it's okay.

Well, I know I was
some sort of sexual icon
to teenage boys back then.

and it turned into a fight.

If we want our best people to
come forward and give themselves
to public service--

17:32.799 --> 17:37.765
and I believe we do--
then how can we continue
to let a mercenary press...

freedoms and the individual
rights of their families?

That's nonsense.

When you looked over at both
tables, you saw the empty chair
next to yours...

the guy on the witness chair
must be your own client.

17:58.465 --> 18:02.165
It was a very efficient direct.
I got everything I needed.

Short-term memory.

18:18.199 --> 18:20.932
Long-term memory is fine.

18:20.999 --> 18:24.732
And I know the reason.
It's when I digress
with opposing counsel.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.132
When I digress,
I lose focus.

19:52.599 --> 19:55.265
This is not about the nature
of the crime.

You know there's an old,
old, ancient tale...

25:11.123 --> 25:14.690
of a small town
where there lived
a very wise old man.

25:14.757 --> 25:17.190
And there was a young boy...

25:17.257 --> 25:19.790
who was determined
to show that that old man...

25:19.857 --> 25:23.690
wasn't really as smart
and as wise as--

25:23.757 --> 25:25.757
as he pretended
to be after all.

25:25.823 --> 25:29.057
And the young boy had a plan
to humiliate the old man.

25:29.123 --> 25:32.190
His plan was to capture
a small bird,

25:32.257 --> 25:36.523
and take the bird
cupped in his palms
to the old man and say,

25:36.590 --> 25:39.023
"What do I have
in my hands, old man?"

25:39.090 --> 25:42.323
He didn't expect the old man
to guess correctly,
but even if he did,

25:42.390 --> 25:46.423
the young boy would then say,
"Is it dead or alive, old man?"

25:46.490 --> 25:49.923
And if the old man said,
"It's alive,"

25:49.990 --> 25:52.023
then the boy was going
to squeeze the bird,

25:52.090 --> 25:54.823
break its neck, and
then reveal it to be dead.

25:54.890 --> 25:58.990
However, if the old man
said, "It's dead,"

25:59.057 --> 26:01.590
he would simply open
his palms and
allow the bird to fly away.

26:01.657 --> 26:04.990
So he went and caught
the bird and he brought
it to the old man...

26:05.057 --> 26:07.223
and he said, "Old man,
what do I have in my hands?"

26:07.290 --> 26:09.557
And the old man looked at him
a moment and then he said,

26:09.623 --> 26:13.423
"You have a bird
in your hand, young man."

26:13.490 --> 26:17.923
And then the young man said,
"Is it dead or alive,
old man?"

And the old man looked
at him a long moment,

26:21.657 --> 26:25.523

The reason he gave
the Gerry Spence

he forgot the facts.
