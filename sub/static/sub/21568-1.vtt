Riley! Riley, are you okay,
honey?

15:28.762 --> 15:30.528
Are you Mrs. Turling?
Yes.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.297
It was a very small fire...

15:32.399 --> 15:34.065
so you're looking at minimal
damage.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.466
Don't let the trucks scare you.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.335
We have to respond this way
to all alarms.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.370
Thank you.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.205
We're almost finished inside,
so I'm gonna get started...

15:41.308 --> 15:43.675
on the paperwork for your
insurance.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.210
Do you have any idea what might
have caused it?

15:46.313 --> 15:50.181
It, um, it appears to have
started on the stove.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.184
The stove?

15:53.286 --> 15:56.387
That can't be right.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.590
When we got here, the burner
was turned all the way up.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.131
I'm so sorry.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.711
Sorry, got here as fast
as I could.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.679
That's okay.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.750
Well, sounds like it could've
been a lot worse.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.554
I wasn't even here and my life
flashed before my eyes.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.423
It's just stuff. We'll get it
all replaced.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.192
Yeah.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.893
And look for a new nanny.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.864
Yeah, looks like it.

16:39.966 --> 16:43.134
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.103
I've just been really stressed
with this whole transition...

16:45.205 --> 16:47.271
and I didn't mean to take
it out on you.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.340
You're-- no, you're right, um--

16:49.442 --> 16:52.877
I could do a better job
of checking in.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.545
I do trust you, Ben.

16:54.647 --> 16:58.783
Good, I don't plan on giving you
a reason not to.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.752
Hey, did you talk to your mom?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.321
Ask if she sent Riley's doll,
I want to send a thank you.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.591
Uh, no, I've been playing phone
tag with her.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.394
I talked to my sister and she
didn't send it...

17:09.496 --> 17:11.596
but she assures me a nice set
of paints are in the mail.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.799
Oh, good, maybe Riley can redo
the cabinets.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.769
Right.

That is the third time this week
somebody's called and hung up.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.782
We both have cell phones,
let's get rid of that line.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.483
The only people that call
are telemarketers.

17:32.585 --> 17:36.387
I guess. Just with the calls
and the letters--

17:38.825 --> 17:42.460
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.396
Nothing to worry about.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.267
Except for grease fires,
they're very dangerous.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.303
All right, I'm gonna go see
what we're working with.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.240
On a scale of one to ten,
what am I bracing myself for?

17:56.342 --> 17:57.909
An 11.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.477
Really?

17:59.579 --> 18:02.246
Okay, fine, a two, but a really
traumatic two.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.248
Okay, well, you did say you want
a new stove, so--

18:04.350 --> 18:05.416
Not like this.

18:07.921 --> 18:11.255
It's gonna be okay. Promise.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.940
We're so happy to have you here,
Alyssa.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.709
Oh, trust me, I was excited
to get your call.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.377
You're staying in the guest
room...

18:33.480 --> 18:35.680
but feel free to decorate it
however you want.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.949
Just consider it yours.
Thank you.

18:38.051 --> 18:42.353
My husband and I are really
grateful that you're here.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.789
Our last nanny really felt
like family...

18:44.891 --> 18:48.960
and we're hoping that you feel
like that soon, too.

18:49.062 --> 18:52.029
Oh, wow, what a lovely family.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.733
Thank you. So, this is your
room right here.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.903
Right next to Riley's,
Ben and I sleep downstairs.

18:59.005 --> 19:02.240
So, just take some time to
settle in and come down...

19:02.342 --> 19:03.875
and I'll introduce you to Riley.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.409
Perfect.

19:09.749 --> 19:14.051
Riley? This is Miss Alyssa.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.887
Well, hello, Riley, I'm gonna
be your new nanny.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.989
How does that sound?

19:23.530 --> 19:26.464
Well, who's this?

19:26.566 --> 19:27.932
It's a new birthday gift.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.601
Ah. Well, does she have a name?

19:32.539 --> 19:39.977
Hm, I think that she looks like
an Alyssa. What do you think?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.646
That's your name.

19:41.748 --> 19:45.016
It is? Oh, no.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.951
Well, then I guess that you and
I will have to come up...

19:47.053 --> 19:49.954
with a name for her together.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.957
Deal?

19:55.495 --> 19:56.827
Hey, are you up for a trip?

19:56.930 --> 19:59.063
I wanna show you one of Riley's
favorite spots.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.040
This is a great place to bring
Riley if you ever feel like...

20:09.142 --> 20:10.741
she's just got tons of energy.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.710
She'll just run herself ragged.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.478
She's a sweet girl.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.481
Yeah, we think so.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.050
She looks just like you.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.686
Oh, she's adopted actually.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.521
Oh.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.891
I was a foster kid, bounced
around a lot of homes...

20:26.993 --> 20:28.526
it was hard.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.761
So, whenever I pictured
motherhood...

20:30.863 --> 20:32.830
this is what I thought of.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.366
Giving a child the stability
I never had.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.501
It was important to me.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.971
Well, it's not blood
that makes family.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.640
We surround ourselves with the
people that we love.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.908
That's family.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.743
Yeah.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.981
Oh, no, that was my
grandmother's.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.415
Yes, was.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.918
Ugh.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.655
Hey, charge it to your new
account.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.558
Hey, can we get the adjuster
in here this week?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.926
The sooner we can get this
kitchen back to normal...

21:02.028 --> 21:03.794
the better.

21:03.896 --> 21:08.065
Some more bad news.
Stove's on back order.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.501
So, it's the hot plate for the
foreseeable future.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.140
Sorry to interrupt, we're just
grabbing a drink.

21:16.242 --> 21:19.610
Uh, this is Alyssa. Alyssa,
this is my husband, Ben.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.379
Nice to meet you.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.014
You as well...
welcome to the team.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.082
Happy to be here.
Ben, was it?

21:25.184 --> 21:26.584
Yeah.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.686
Okay, ready?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.393
She seems nice.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.195
Yeah, Riley really seems to like
her.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.831
Well, I hope this one works out
better than the last one.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.900

Hey...

21:56.816 --> 21:59.116
I saw that fire truck yesterday
and was just beside myself.

21:59.218 --> 22:03.187
Oh, everyone's okay, it was just
a small stove fire.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.990
I'm relieved to hear that.
I had worried it had been--

22:06.092 --> 22:07.858
Been what?

22:07.960 --> 22:10.594
Well, you know I don't like
to stick my nose...

22:10.697 --> 22:12.163
where it doesn't belong.

22:12.265 --> 22:14.031
Of course.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.735
But I saw someone outside your
house the other day, young girl.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.237
She was walking up and down
the path.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.173
Seemed nervous, it was very
strange.

22:22.275 --> 22:23.774
I've been interviewing
nannies...

22:23.876 --> 22:26.711
so, you probably just saw
one of them.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.982
I'm sure that was it.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.584
Well, thanks.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.886
Yeah, I'm glad everyone's okay.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.197
I just have one more question...

22:46.299 --> 22:47.965
about what we talked about
the other day.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.101

know anything about us, right?

23:13.893 --> 23:17.027
Oh, yeah, just with the fire and
all the change...

23:17.130 --> 23:18.629
I just want to make sure
I've dotted all my "I's"...

23:18.731 --> 23:20.498
and crossed all my "t's",
so to speak.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.099
Absolutely.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.768
Oh, one more thing.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.971
If you notice something strange,
will you tell me?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.672
Strange, how?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.574
Just if something doesn't seem
right.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.710
Of course.

23:32.812 --> 23:36.013

Um, the insurance adjuster
called...

24:13.853 --> 24:16.687
and he's just running a little
late today, so...

24:16.789 --> 24:18.656
I'm just thinking we're
burning daylight.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.224
You guys should just go
to the beach without me.

I'll meet you later.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.661

do it another day?

24:23.763 --> 24:26.630
No, she's been looking forward
to this for weeks.

24:26.732 --> 24:27.932
And so have you.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.800
If we hadn't adopted her
in December...

24:29.902 --> 24:31.101
that's the first place you
would have taken her.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.003
I tried, you stopped me.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.806
It was 32 degrees and snowing,
Ben.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.009
I just-- I don't want to
disappoint her.

24:39.111 --> 24:42.046
I think you not being there
would disappoint her more.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.681
I won't be long.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.116
Okay, you sure?

24:46.219 --> 24:47.318
Positive.

to impose.

enough.

I wanted strawberry.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.215
You're gonna love that one,
I promise.

25:51.317 --> 25:54.051
Piña colada always reminds me
of being on vacation...

25:54.153 --> 25:55.319
or on an island.

25:55.421 --> 25:57.454
Do you know how to swim,
Riley?

25:57.557 --> 26:00.057
She takes lessons at the Y.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.294
You know, I grew up by the
water, right up the coast.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.229
Really?
Yeah.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.065
Yep, and when my parents moved
away, they left the house to me.

If you follow the shoreline
for a very long time...

26:10.937 --> 26:12.870
you'll come to a little town

Oh, cool.

there's a little cove hiding...

where I grew up.

someday.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.414

Um, yeah, you know, I was kind
of hoping we'd wait for Kara.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.265
She'd-- she'd want to be here
for that.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.935
It's like 90 degrees and we've
been baking in the sun all day.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.536
I don't think she's gonna
make it.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.538
You've kept her on the sand
the whole time...

27:21.641 --> 27:23.974
you brought her here for the
ocean, she wants to try.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.075
Don't you wanna try, Riley?

27:25.177 --> 27:28.445
Yeah! Come on, Dad.

27:28.547 --> 27:32.249
Okay. Ready for the big moment?

27:32.351 --> 27:34.551
Ready.
All right, let's go.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.925
[KARA] Hey, Ben, the adjuster
never showed...

27:42.028 --> 27:43.961
so I'm just gonna reschedule
for another day.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.196
I really don't want to miss
Riley's first time in the water.

27:46.298 --> 27:51.902
So, stall for me, would ya?
I'll see you soon. Bye.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.438
Hi, can I help you?

27:58.077 --> 28:00.077
Are you-- are you Kara Turling?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.312
Yes.

28:02.415 --> 28:05.149
My name is Vanessa Shaw.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.421
I'm Riley's mother.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.560
Oh.

28:16.662 --> 28:20.497
I just came to talk. You haven't
responded to any of my letters.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.499
How did you find out
where I live?

28:22.601 --> 28:26.670
I've been working really hard
on getting better... for her.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.906
I love her.

28:29.008 --> 28:33.343
You've been calling, haven't
you? Hanging up, that was you?

28:33.446 --> 28:36.547
I was trying to get up
the nerve.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.083
I've imagined this conversation
a million times.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.551
You need to leave.

28:40.653 --> 28:43.353
Please, I just want to be part
of her life.

28:43.456 --> 28:46.256
Then maybe you should have put
her first.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.659
I made some mistakes.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.229
You were a danger to yourself
and to Riley.

28:52.331 --> 28:55.632
I never had the fire department
come to my house.

28:55.735 --> 28:59.069
How do you know about that?

28:59.171 --> 29:01.672
It doesn't matter.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.475
What do you want from us?

29:05.845 --> 29:08.245
I wanna see my daughter.

29:13.686 --> 29:16.220
We need to memorialize this.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.504
Hey.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.306
Here. Cheese!

29:36.408 --> 29:37.608
Can you say, "cheese"?
Cheese!

29:37.710 --> 29:39.109
Can you say, "cheese"?

29:41.714 --> 29:43.147
Oh, do you mind taking a photo
of us?

29:43.249 --> 29:46.416
Yeah, sure.

29:46.519 --> 29:50.654
Let's take a picture.

29:50.756 --> 29:54.124
Aw, you guys make such a cute
family. All right, together!

29:54.226 --> 29:55.526
We're not really a fam--

29:55.628 --> 29:57.628
Aw, come on, Ben,
it's just a picture.

29:57.730 --> 29:59.763
[CALI]
One, two and... cheese!

29:59.865 --> 30:01.298
Perfect.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.599
Thank you.

30:08.641 --> 30:11.441
Hey! Sorry we missed you.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.212
What's wrong?

30:18.584 --> 30:21.418
Let's go find a jar
for your shells.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.226
What's wrong?

30:31.831 --> 30:34.231
You're starting to scare me
a little bit.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.601
She was here?

30:39.438 --> 30:41.271
Who?

30:41.373 --> 30:48.345
Riley's birth mother. She just
showed up on our doorstep.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.750
What-- what did she want?

30:53.853 --> 30:56.420
What do you think?

31:13.606 --> 31:16.440
Did you have fun at the beach
today?

31:18.143 --> 31:19.509
I really wish I could have
been there...

31:19.612 --> 31:22.179
but I'll plan something fun
really soon.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.581
Just for the two of us, okay?

31:24.683 --> 31:26.717
You promised.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.055
I know, I'm really sorry.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.558
[ALYSSA]
All right, Riley, I found them.

31:34.660 --> 31:39.363
Hi. We were just gonna do
some coloring.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.865
Did you want to join us?

31:44.737 --> 31:46.236
You two go ahead.

31:48.340 --> 31:53.610
Okay... so, what color do you
want to start with?

31:53.712 --> 31:55.779
[ALYSSA] Ooh, how about red?

31:55.881 --> 31:57.648
I like green.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.417
Excellent choice.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.564
I'll call the adoption agency
in the morning.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.800
I don't want you on
edge about this.

32:16.902 --> 32:19.269
I just wasn't expecting it,
that's all.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.239
Of course not, this is supposed
to be confidential.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.175
I'd like to know how she
even found out.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.444
Well, she seems very persistent.

32:29.815 --> 32:34.952
You know, there's nothing she
can do, right? Kara?

32:35.054 --> 32:37.154
I can't lose her, Ben.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.290
And you won't. She's ours.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.926
Can we just leave this alone
for right now?

32:43.028 --> 32:46.763
Yeah.

32:46.865 --> 32:48.865
How did she do?

32:50.703 --> 32:54.738
She did great.
Look, she's like a fish.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.210
[BEN] Maybe we should get
a pool or something.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.887
[ALYSSA]
That looks great.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.289
Here, do you want to see mine?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.457
What is it?

33:13.559 --> 33:14.925
Well, that's my house.

33:15.027 --> 33:17.427
The one I was telling you about
today at the beach.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.530
And there's the water
and there's you, Riley...

33:20.632 --> 33:24.534
and your dad and do you know
who this is?

33:24.636 --> 33:27.337
Mom?

33:27.439 --> 33:31.608
No, no. That's me.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.644
You, me, Daddy.

33:37.016 --> 33:40.484
You, me, Daddy.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.287
Yeah.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.996
I assure you, we don't
normally eat like this.

33:53.098 --> 33:56.700
We do, on occasion, feed our
child a vegetable.

33:56.802 --> 34:00.370
Well, I guess there are always
the tomatoes in the sauce.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.605
Tomatoes are a fruit.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.973
Really?

34:03.075 --> 34:04.908
Yeah, there's all kinds
of strange rules...

34:05.010 --> 34:10.013
like a strawberry isn't a berry,
but you know what is? A banana.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.915
Well, that doesn't even make
sense.

34:12.017 --> 34:14.551
Yeah, it's funny, we think
things are a certain way...

34:14.653 --> 34:17.521
when they're really much,
much different.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.896
So, Alyssa, how are you
settling in?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.935
I'm very comfortable.

34:32.037 --> 34:34.371
[KARA]
Oh, good.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.672
Can I have some more milk,
please?

34:35.774 --> 34:38.542
I'll, um-- I'll get it.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.782
Who's ready for another slice?

35:09.942 --> 35:12.075
What has gotten into you?

35:12.177 --> 35:14.644
I've missed you.

35:16.014 --> 35:19.749
<i> ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

35:28.527 --> 35:30.660
Do you want me to stop?

35:30.762 --> 35:32.662
No.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.439
I miss you, too.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.705
[RILEY]
Daddy!

36:20.646 --> 36:22.746
I'll go get her.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.681
No, I'll go.

36:29.121 --> 36:30.720
So, you had a nightmare?

36:30.822 --> 36:32.055
Yeah.

36:32.157 --> 36:35.091
It's okay, nothing can hurt you.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.494
Alyssa?

36:37.596 --> 36:39.462
I heard her call out
for her dad...

36:39.565 --> 36:41.565
so I just wanted to make sure
she's okay.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.233
I've got it from here.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.570
Okay, feel better, Riley.
Goodnight.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.774
Hey, sweetie, did you have a bad
dream?

36:50.876 --> 36:52.609
[RILEY] Where's Daddy?

36:52.711 --> 36:56.713
He's in the bed. Do you want to
tell me what's wrong?

36:58.951 --> 37:00.116
I'm scared.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.630
Well, there's nothing in here.

37:13.732 --> 37:18.969
Unless-- is this guy giving
you a hard time?

37:19.071 --> 37:22.772
Do you want me to stay with you
until you go to sleep?

37:22.874 --> 37:24.174
Yeah.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.978
How about I sing you a song?

37:28.080 --> 37:31.948
Can you sing to her? She gets
scared at night, too.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.283
Sure.

37:37.055 --> 37:42.125
♪ Rock-a-bye baby in the
treetop ♪

37:42.227 --> 37:47.731
♪ When the wind blows
The cradle will rock ♪

37:47.833 --> 37:53.136

The cradle will fall ♪

37:53.238 --> 37:58.975
♪ And down will come baby
Cradle and all ♪

38:00.912 --> 38:06.016
You never have to be scared,
Riley, I'll always protect you.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.696
Looking a little flush, Ben.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.599
Just thirsty.

38:31.276 --> 38:33.276
What the hell were you doing
at the dinner table tonight?

38:33.378 --> 38:36.713
Having dinner with my new
family.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.850
You know what, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.952
It's not the right position
for you.

38:43.055 --> 38:46.823
Do you have another position
in mind?

38:50.996 --> 38:53.730
Look, I don't know what kind
of games you're playing...

38:53.832 --> 38:55.799
but I'm a happily married man.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.135
You weren't a year ago.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.240
Excuse me?

39:04.343 --> 39:06.009
Do you really not remember me?

39:07.979 --> 39:09.779
That hurts my feelings,
Ben...

39:09.881 --> 39:11.948
because I could never forget
you.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.617
Here, let me refresh your
memory.

39:14.720 --> 39:19.055
It was a crowded bar in the
city, I sent you a drink.

39:19.157 --> 39:25.428
I was wearing a blue dress,
you said it brought out my eyes.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.063
We shared a cab ride home...

39:27.165 --> 39:29.332
but when we got to my place,
you never left.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.641
That girl was blonde.

39:38.744 --> 39:41.177
That girl was me.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.714
There we go.

39:44.816 --> 39:48.318
What the hell are you doing
here? How did you find me?

39:48.420 --> 39:49.919
I thought you'd be happy
to see me.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.855
You knew we had--

39:54.059 --> 39:56.726
You've been living here this
whole time, are you crazy?

39:56.828 --> 39:58.661
Don't call me that.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.830
Fine. You're delusional.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.099
That's not what you said
that night.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.702
To be honest, I don't remember
what I said that night...

40:05.804 --> 40:10.206
because it was one night,
a year ago.

40:10.308 --> 40:11.941
Do you know how hard I've worked
on my marriage?

40:12.043 --> 40:13.777
If Kara ever found out--

40:13.879 --> 40:15.011
Well, then, I guess you don't
want her finding out...

40:15.113 --> 40:16.913
now, do you?

40:17.015 --> 40:20.049
What do you want from me?

40:46.278 --> 40:48.011
You're fine, it's okay.
I'm right here.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.480
I'll catch you, I won't let
you fall.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.615
It's okay, you got this,
you're fine. Slide down.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.184
Hurry up!

40:55.754 --> 40:56.853
Can you guys let her through,
please?

41:02.794 --> 41:06.529
It's okay, honey... it's okay.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.636
Um... why don't you go play
on the swings...

41:13.738 --> 41:15.138
for a little while, okay?

41:21.246 --> 41:24.113
Are you following us now?

41:24.216 --> 41:26.316
She always was afraid
of heights.

41:26.418 --> 41:28.618
Please don't make me call
the authorities.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.221
I just wanted to see her.
I'll stay here.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.790
Then we're leaving.

41:33.892 --> 41:38.027
You won't even give me this?
I'm not even talking to her.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.164
You don't understand what's
it's been like for me.

41:41.266 --> 41:44.033
No, what I don't understand is
how you could have someone...

41:44.135 --> 41:46.236
like Riley and make the choices
that you did.

41:48.206 --> 41:51.908
I've forgiven myself,
hopefully she can, too.

41:54.779 --> 41:58.348
You can't keep me away
from her forever.

41:58.450 --> 42:03.286
Riley, we're leaving,
come on, let's go! Come on!

42:19.004 --> 42:21.170
Thought you might be thirsty.

42:21.273 --> 42:23.273
I'm not.

42:23.375 --> 42:27.343
Come on... it's fresh squeezed!

42:30.282 --> 42:33.216
If you're going to stay here, we
need to set some ground rules.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.318
Mm.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.258
■
Well, you're the boss, boss.

42:42.360 --> 42:48.965
No more flirting. In fact, we
don't even need to talk, period.

42:52.404 --> 42:53.703
Understand?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.705
I do.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.048
[BEN]
What are you doing?

43:05.150 --> 43:07.917
Not talking.

43:08.019 --> 43:11.187
Please stop. Please stop.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.855
No, I don't want to stop...

43:12.958 --> 43:16.659
and I don't think you want me
to, either.

43:16.761 --> 43:22.932
I do-- stop, please. Stop it.
Please stop!

43:26.204 --> 43:30.273
You need to stop.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.841
Do you remember what you said
to me that night...

43:31.943 --> 43:33.643
that we were together?
No.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.912
You said that we were good
together, and we are, Ben.

43:36.014 --> 43:37.714
I was drunk, stop it!

43:37.816 --> 43:41.084
I was out of my mind,
I was in a terrible place.

43:41.186 --> 43:44.420
No... I've seen the way
that you look at me.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.956
Your eyes follow me
wherever I go.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.092
That's not true.

43:49.194 --> 43:52.662
I came here to show you
how well we fit together.

43:52.764 --> 43:55.298
That day at the beach,
it was effortless.
