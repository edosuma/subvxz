08:53.010 --> 08:54.838
Oh, you're
my Man Crush Monday.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.144
Hell, yeah.

08:56.187 --> 08:59.887
You know what?
You two are really cute.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.803
Next round's on me.
[laughter]

09:02.846 --> 09:04.761
both: Dibs! Jinx!

09:04.805 --> 09:05.980
Damn it!

09:06.023 --> 09:08.286
Oh, I'm in a tough spot
right now.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.028
I love Mika,
but I also love drama.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.508
You know what?
They'll be fine.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.466
She just needs zaddy
to show her some more love.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.990
- Yeah.
- Face it, bro, Shelly's got

09:16.033 --> 09:17.513
a case of the Pam.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.602
It's a Pam-demic.

09:19.646 --> 09:22.518
No, no, no,
she has Gary-rrhea.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.565
I don't know do that
as well as you do that.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.479
Ooh, hold on to your shrimps.

09:27.523 --> 09:30.265
Looks like there's trouble
in paradise.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.354
Come on, y'all.
That's just Black love.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.182
They are just talking it out.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.923
See, right now she's saying,

09:35.966 --> 09:37.838
"When we get home later,
my king,

09:37.881 --> 09:39.927
I'm going to massage you here,
here, and here."

09:39.970 --> 09:42.625
Man, that isn't Black love.
That's Black "Love & Hip Hop."

09:42.669 --> 09:44.758
He should have gave her
that record deal.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.324
See?
all: Oh.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.326
- Wow.
- No.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.632
Hey, you think she got

09:49.676 --> 09:51.242
those lemon-pepper
turkey tenders in there?

09:51.286 --> 09:52.766
I don't think so.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.071
Wait, you guys,

09:54.115 --> 09:56.508
but Nick's still paying
for all this, right?

09:56.552 --> 09:57.988
Oh, hey, while you're here,

09:58.032 --> 10:00.948
can we get, like, I don't know,
five lobster entrées,

10:00.991 --> 10:04.516
a couple of tiramisus, two
of those Pesco's sweatshirts?

10:04.560 --> 10:05.866
A bottle
of lemon-pepper sauce

10:05.909 --> 10:07.041
just to keep in the car.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.695
A bottle lemon-pepper sauce.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.479
Oh, can I get a lobster
out the tank-don't kill it.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.003
I want to have it as a pet
for my nieces or myself.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.136
A hat to cover
my child's red head.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.441
But all of it to-go.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.226
- Thank you.
- Please. Thank you.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.403
Thank you.
- Oh, you're so sweet.

10:21.446 --> 10:26.060
These NASA photos are faked.
This is the real thing.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.671
Phil, walk away.

10:28.715 --> 10:32.066
Don't blame me
when you fall off.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.502
I'll never get used to it.

10:33.545 --> 10:36.766
Hey, champ, you want
to talk about last night?

10:36.810 --> 10:38.246
Uh, what about it?

10:38.289 --> 10:41.292
Well, some people are saying,
not myself,

10:41.336 --> 10:44.818
but maybe you broke up
with Nick for doing his job.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.429
Look, he said he was going
to be there for us,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.692
and then he bailed--it's like
Keith all over again.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.173
It's nothing like Keith.
Who's Keith?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.783
My first fiancé.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.785
So it's just better to end
things with Nick

10:55.829 --> 10:57.744
before someone gets hurt.
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.181
I thought you broke up
with all your fiancés.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.878
Not the first one.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.011
Look, Kenan,
I'm really busy, okay?

11:04.054 --> 11:05.621
I approved a lot
of crappy stories

11:05.665 --> 11:08.145
when we were making
mac and cheese.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.278
No, no, come on, come on,
Talk to me, now.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.410
All right, look,
it was a long time ago.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.717
Keith and I fell in love
freshman year at college.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.459
I pledged JKA--skee-wee.
He was a Kappa.

11:17.502 --> 11:20.244
Boo. Sorry, sigma.

11:20.288 --> 11:23.247
You know!
Continue.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.293
Anyway, a week
before the wedding,

11:25.336 --> 11:26.642
he broke things off

11:26.686 --> 11:28.731
and didn't tell me why,
no explanation.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.951
Didn't even bother to ask me
for the ring back.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.387
Well, that's messed up.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.823
Yeah, and I swore

11:33.867 --> 11:36.783
I would never let myself
get hurt like that again.

11:36.826 --> 11:40.961
So now when I see
the warning signs, I'm out.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.528
Yeah, but what
if you're wrong?

11:43.572 --> 11:46.488
Either way, I save myself
a lot of heartbreak.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.317
Now, I really got to find
a replacement for this

11:49.360 --> 11:51.449
"Karens have feelings, too"
segment.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.625
Oh, good Lord, you was drunk
on that splish-splash.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.715
- I know.
- I'll see you later.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.026
Bam!
All in your face.

12:03.070 --> 12:06.813
That's Rachelle on Instagram
holding hands with a man--

12:06.856 --> 12:07.944
a Black man.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.859
Clearly she was into me.

12:09.903 --> 12:13.776
No, look, Rachelle
with her arm around a woman,

12:13.820 --> 12:16.474
a white woman or Greek.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.475
I can't tell.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.868
I mean, Greek is white,

12:18.912 --> 12:20.870
but not at certain times
in our history.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.785
Damn it, Pam, they was
always white to me.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.439
What we going to do, man?

12:24.482 --> 12:25.875
We can't walk up to here
and ask her what she's into.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.355
Not in these times.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.704
We need someone

12:28.748 --> 12:31.228
who is not afraid to ask
offensive questions.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.187
Right, somebody from
a different generation

12:33.230 --> 12:34.579
who's not afraid
to get canceled

12:34.623 --> 12:36.668
'cause we already
gave up on them.

12:36.712 --> 12:41.064
Mm-hmm, just a sad person
who just will ask anything.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.850
Let me put this in terms a
younger person can understand.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.853
What's your most used emoji--

12:46.896 --> 12:50.987
uh, eggplant or vagina emoji?

12:51.031 --> 12:54.469
How long does it take
to say Pam?

12:55.513 --> 12:58.386
I think I got your answer.
She's attracted to Pam.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.691
- Yes!
- What?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.824
- And Gary.
- Yes!

13:01.868 --> 13:03.043
Phil, can you clarify

13:03.086 --> 13:04.653
what you think the word
"answer" means?

13:04.696 --> 13:07.177
Apparently she's something
called "omnisexual."

13:07.221 --> 13:09.527
Ah, of course.
What the hell does that mean?

13:09.571 --> 13:12.269
I assume it means she only
has sex in Omni hotels.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.010
So you two better
start saving up.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.925
Not quite.
She's just progressive.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.623
It means she's open
to finding love from anyone.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.799
Sure.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.062
Well,
let the best anyone win.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.585
- Game on!
- Whoa!

13:23.628 --> 13:26.022
You two are getting
into some dangerous territory.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.719
Let me give you
some hard-earned advice

13:27.763 --> 13:29.112
from my days in Phil Collin--

13:29.156 --> 13:31.811
My Phil Collins tribute band
with my friend Collin.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.335
Wait, wait, wait.
You have a friend?

13:34.378 --> 13:37.120
I did.
But then Trisha got between us.

13:37.164 --> 13:40.036
Sure, I lost my virginity,
but I also lost my best friend,

13:40.080 --> 13:42.386
and they both
were very painful.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.823
- Oh.
- Ew.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.869
Trust me on this.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.784
- [exhales deeply]
- [mumbles]

13:48.828 --> 13:50.655
You know, he is right, Gary.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.919
Besides, the woman I was
with two nights ago told me

13:52.962 --> 13:55.747
I had to stop having
meaningless flings.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.402
I mean, I cannot remember
her name,

13:58.446 --> 14:00.404
but she was very wise.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.059
So how about
we just let this one go?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.582
All right, forget it.

14:04.626 --> 14:05.845
- All right.
- Yeah, man.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.455
I don't even remember
what it was about.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.761
I'm glad we cleared
that up, okay.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.154
Yeah, we did.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.246
[mumbling to self]

14:16.290 --> 14:19.380
Mika. You got time
to go car shopping with me?

14:19.423 --> 14:21.121
You know how bad I am
at negotiating.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.949
Birdie's allowance
is, like, a stack a week.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.341
Look, Kenan, I'm really busy.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.256
I'm still undoing all my
mac-and-cheese decisions.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.519
And by the way,
I couldn't unbook Chet Hanks,

14:28.563 --> 14:30.652
so you may have to
make jerk chicken with him.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.828
Chet Hanks.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.048
Oh--Well, now you definitely
owe me one.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.137
[sighs]
Fine.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.098
Okay, so, when I'm haggling,
if it looks like

14:42.142 --> 14:44.013
I'm going to cry, I'm not.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.450
If it looks like I'm going to
throw up, I'm not.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.801
if it looks like he's going to
cry and throw up, we winning.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.934
That's great advice.
Let's go get 'em.

14:51.978 --> 14:55.068
Wait a minute.
Keith Allen's Luxury Autos?

14:55.111 --> 14:56.460
Kenan, what are you doing?

14:56.504 --> 14:57.853
All right, I just happen
to be shopping

14:57.897 --> 14:59.681
for a fancy-ass car
from the guy

14:59.724 --> 15:02.640
that broke your heart
in a million little pieces.

15:02.684 --> 15:05.774
But, Mika, you never got over
your first fiancé,

15:05.817 --> 15:09.647
and now you are sabotaging all
your future chances at love.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.388
Now, come on in here
and talk to this man.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.477
You know what's funny, is
that I remember telling you

15:13.521 --> 15:17.003
to stay out of it, so, no,
we ain't going nowhere.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.962
Well, what kind of friend
would I be

15:20.006 --> 15:21.616
if I just listened
to you all the time?

15:21.659 --> 15:22.965
Uh, you'd be a smart friend.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.662
All right, come up
off my unlock button.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.230
You going to listen to me,
Kenan--we staying here.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.624
Hi. Welcome. Come to
test-drive a new vehicle today?

15:29.667 --> 15:32.670
No. No, no.
Thank you, no. <i>De nada.</i>

15:32.714 --> 15:34.585
Mika, talk to him.

15:34.629 --> 15:38.067
Get some closure.
It'll help you move on.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.243
Okay, fine.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.203
Keith Allen!

15:43.246 --> 15:44.987
- Mika Caldwell!
- Wow!

15:45.031 --> 15:48.730
- Come on.
- What a coincidence, huh?

15:48.773 --> 15:50.645
[chuckles]
You know, my friend here

15:50.688 --> 15:53.126
wants to buy
the most expensive car you got.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.171
- Oh.
- Uh, that is correct.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.521
I enjoy expensive things.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.698
I'm actually the owner of issue
number 30 of "X Men"...

16:00.742 --> 16:01.786
mint!

16:01.830 --> 16:04.137
Oh, oh, this guy's got taste.

16:07.531 --> 16:10.882
So here it is--
the most expensive car we have.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.362
Great.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.669
Uh, quick question--
you got any, uh, deals going on

16:14.712 --> 16:16.845
or, like, any rebates
with this baby?

16:16.888 --> 16:18.890
[laughing]

16:18.934 --> 16:20.414
- I'm joking.
- This guy.

16:20.457 --> 16:24.244
I'll just show myself
the car while y'all catch up.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.810
Let's see.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.031
Maybe give it a little smack,
talk to it.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.728
Uh, Lamborghini up.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.339
Uh, just push the button
right there.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.775
Oh, my bad.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.298
This must be one
of the older ones.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.432
No, it's a 2023.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.695
Yes, it is.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.523
This is so blowing my mind
right now.

16:42.566 --> 16:43.872
How long has it been since--

16:43.915 --> 16:46.614
11 years ago,
this Valentine's Day.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.051
Yeah, I remember because
we were supposed to get married

16:49.095 --> 16:50.835
on Valentine's Day, so...

16:50.879 --> 16:53.751
Hey, man, how much horsepower
is in these wipers?

16:53.795 --> 16:55.492
You know what?
I'll look it up online.

16:55.536 --> 16:56.711
Carry on.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.148
Well, let me say,
I'm really sorry.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.194
Oh, I don't want
your apologies, Keith.

17:01.237 --> 17:04.327
I just want to know
why you ghosted me.

17:04.371 --> 17:07.113
Like, what was
so wrong with me?

17:07.156 --> 17:08.505
Nothing.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.117
I just think
we really weren't vibing.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.335
[horn honks]
- Oh, oh.

17:12.378 --> 17:14.424
Sorry.
Horn works, though.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.776
So you walked away
from a four-year relationship

17:18.819 --> 17:21.561
six days before our wedding
because we weren't vibing?

17:21.605 --> 17:24.913
Mika, the truth is...

17:24.955 --> 17:27.002
I smoked a lot of weed
back then.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.699
I mean, if I knew
what stupid thought I had

17:28.743 --> 17:31.572
when I was 24, I'd tell you.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.922
But I just don't remember.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.271
Seriously?

17:35.315 --> 17:38.057
[horn honks, alarm blares]
- Oh! Uh, I'm sorry.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.015
Mika, Keith, can y'all help me
out here?

17:40.059 --> 17:43.366
I don't know what I did.
- Wow.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.672
Yo, we got a stucky!

17:44.715 --> 17:46.804
Sorry,
I'm the stucky, I guess.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.725
What the hell?

17:54.769 --> 17:56.945
I thought we agreed that
we were not going to let a girl

17:56.988 --> 17:59.600
get in between us
like Phil's band.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.123
What are you doing here?

18:01.167 --> 18:02.559
She DM'd me.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.258
Look, here's the thing, Pam...

18:05.301 --> 18:07.303
she fine as hell--that's it.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.522
Same reason you here, I bet.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.741
- She is very attractive.
- Yeah.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.961
But this doesn't make
any sense.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.703
She just DM'd me
to come over here.

18:15.746 --> 18:18.706
She DM'd you the same time
she DM'd me?

18:18.749 --> 18:20.795
You think it means
what I think it means?

18:20.838 --> 18:24.277
A threesome?
We cannot be that kind of band.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.583
We are not the Jonas Brothers.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.195
Or, hot take, are we?

18:31.458 --> 18:33.503
[sighs] Hmm.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.986
- All right.
- Yeah.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.640
- But I've got terms.
- Okay.

18:39.683 --> 18:40.989
- No eye contact.
- I hate eyes.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.425
- Leave your socks on.
- Always.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.079
And don't tell Phil.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.255
I turned him and his partner
down after the Christmas party.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.170
Wait, they asked me second?

18:48.214 --> 18:49.519
[scoffs] Damn.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.869
- Should I do push-ups?
- No.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.741
- Okay.
- We don't got time for that.

18:56.526 --> 18:59.007
Gary and Pam.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.096
I'm so glad you
both could make it.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.489
Come in.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.143
Get in there.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.146
You're just in time
for the customer testimonials.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.060
Girl... What?

19:09.104 --> 19:11.411
Ah, SmoothieLyfe?

19:11.454 --> 19:14.153
This is a damn pyramid scheme.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.328
I should have known.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.200
Nobody has
daytime threesomes anymore.

19:18.244 --> 19:21.334
Hey, guys, you're seeking
financial freedom, too?

19:26.208 --> 19:27.340
I got nothing.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.906
No closure?

19:28.950 --> 19:31.213
Not only did I not get any
closure.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.042
I feel ten times worse.
I got "unclosure."

19:34.085 --> 19:36.044
Wouldn't that just be opened?

19:36.087 --> 19:38.873
All right, well, what reason
would make you feel better?

19:38.916 --> 19:40.266
I don't know. Anything.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.137
Okay, so what if he said,
"I cheated on you"?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.139
Would that be better?
- No.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.793
What if he said
his mama couldn't stand you?

19:45.836 --> 19:47.664
Oh, no, definitely not.
No, his mama loved me.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.406
We're still Facebook friends,
She be like, like, like, like.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.669
- [laughs] That's weird.
- Yeah.

19:52.713 --> 19:55.019
All right, what if he said,
"I'm an addict?"

19:55.063 --> 19:57.239
- Mm.
- Or, "I'm gay"?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.546
- Hmm.
- Or, "It's not you it's me"?

19:59.589 --> 20:01.243
- Ugh.
- "The Devil made me do it"?

20:01.287 --> 20:03.767
Come on, Mika,
these are good reasons.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.116
You know what?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.770
I don't think there's anything
he could've said

20:06.814 --> 20:08.555
that would've made me feel
any better.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.992
So what?
You never get closure?

20:11.035 --> 20:13.951
Maybe I don't get closure
from him.

20:13.995 --> 20:17.303
I mean, I guess I just have
to make the choice to move on

20:17.346 --> 20:19.914
and...be happy.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.916
And I really want to be happy.

20:21.959 --> 20:25.659
Sounds like someone
just found some closure.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.400
So I guess my plan
worked after all.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.272
Okay. You're playing
accidentally worked.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.621
Thanks, Kenan.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.101
I'm going to call Nick
and apologize.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.668
Oh, tell him I got
those Hawks tickets.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.235
Yep.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.454
The view is obstructed,
but they're still good seats.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.282
Ready for that test-drive?

20:40.326 --> 20:42.110
Oh, uh, actually, no.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.851
I don't need a car after all.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.896
Oh, but this isn't a car,
Mr. Williams.

20:45.940 --> 20:46.854
This is a lifestyle.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.117
Uh, yeah, okay.

Man, that girl crazy as hell,

but she about to make me
the smoothie king, though.

Whoa, this is
what a threesome with Phil

20:54.949 --> 20:56.516
and his partner
would taste like.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.257
Man, what is all this crap?

20:58.300 --> 20:59.693
I cannot believe y'all

Did you just buy a car?

21:06.482 --> 21:10.312
Oh, I didn't buy a car.
I leased a lifestyle.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.751
Does that lifestyle come with
selling smoothies, brother?
