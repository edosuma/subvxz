00:58.683 --> 01:03.688
2009, SEOUL

01:14.365 --> 01:17.118
Here, on the house.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.543
Thank you for everything.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.881
I'll miss this.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.562
Do you have a lover in the North?

01:45.313 --> 01:47.565
-Would you like to see?
-Sure.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.781
So pretty!

01:55.448 --> 01:59.494
Not just one lover! You're a greedy man.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.416
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Sure.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.756
When will you come back to the North?

02:11.840 --> 02:15.426
Don't be so chatty.
Have your drink and move on.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.856
Please stay healthy.

02:28.356 --> 02:32.902
Go back, forget what's happened

02:33.361 --> 02:36.114
and have a wonderful life.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.493
Go on now!

03:43.431 --> 03:45.850
Li Young-ho! Surrender!

03:46.601 --> 03:48.144
There's no other way!

03:49.812 --> 03:51.439
You've got nowhere to run.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.900
How do you think we found you?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.822
The North has already abandoned you!

04:00.698 --> 04:02.116
Don't make a scene.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.458
Li! What are you doing?

04:10.541 --> 04:11.876
Sniper unit, report.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.878
Don't move! Freeze!

04:15.296 --> 04:17.006
-Target in range.
-Ready to fire.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.927
Li Young-ho!

04:39.988 --> 04:44.367
YODUK LABOR PRISON CAMP

05:04.679 --> 05:06.681
Reporting, Colonel.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.610
Are you Li Young-ho's son?

05:22.530 --> 05:23.990
How old are you?

05:25.658 --> 05:26.909
Eighteen, sir.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.541
Myung-hoon…

05:45.261 --> 05:50.141
An award from our great leader
for the youth movement…

05:53.352 --> 05:57.523
If it wasn't for your traitor father,
you'd have gone far.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.527
My father is not a traitor.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.700
Don't get worked up,
I'm not interested in that.

06:10.620 --> 06:15.875
Myung-hoon, would you like to leave here?

06:18.503 --> 06:20.171
Is that possible?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.507
There is a way.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.595
For you and your sister
to leave here alive,

06:28.888 --> 06:30.014
there's just one way.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.266
What is that?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.648
Become an agent.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.836
2 YEARS LATER
2011, SEOUL

07:15.935 --> 07:18.729
Unit 8, Comrade Kim Sun-myung.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.215
Head of Recon Bureau Unit 8,
Kim Sun-myung.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.511
He was sent here in 1992,
and ran a shell company.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.727
These three are known sleeper agents.

07:58.144 --> 08:02.190
All in Unit 8,
and all killed by the same suspect.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.526
The lefty who uses a Tokarev.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.406
This is the CCTV footage.

08:14.452 --> 08:19.248
He looks like a skilled assassin
from the North.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.417
"Assassin"?

08:22.460 --> 08:26.422
All the victims were from Unit 8.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.883
They were loyal, but one day,

08:29.175 --> 08:32.261
they were all wiped out by an assassin.

08:32.845 --> 08:37.475
It's part of a power struggle
after Kim Jong Il's health deteriorated.

08:37.975 --> 08:41.020
The anti-Republic of Korea
threw the first punch.

08:45.274 --> 08:49.028
<i>A small drifting boat was rescued</i>
<i>from the Japanese open sea,</i>

08:49.111 --> 08:53.199
<i>and the defectors</i>
<i>reached Incheon Airport today.</i>

08:53.282 --> 08:57.078
<i>A group of four men, four women</i>
<i>and two children</i>

08:57.161 --> 09:00.998
<i>received support</i>
<i>from Nagasaki Immigration,</i>

09:01.082 --> 09:04.252
<i>and they all wanted to be in South Korea.</i>

09:04.544 --> 09:07.838
<i>After debriefing their defection route,</i>

09:07.922 --> 09:10.675
<i>they'll receive relocation support…</i>

09:10.758 --> 09:12.051
Name?

09:12.301 --> 09:13.636
Kang Dae-ho.

09:13.719 --> 09:14.929
Age?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.180
Nineteen years old.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.934
Why did you defect?

09:20.518 --> 09:22.103
I wanted to live like a human being.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.399
By yourself? What about your family?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.487
They're all dead.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.619
Please call once a month to check in.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.037
FOSTER CARE AGREEMENT

09:40.121 --> 09:44.542
Dae-ho's quiet and gruff,
but he's a gentle soul.

09:45.209 --> 09:49.171
Please take good care of him.
Thank you again.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.382
We should be thankful.

09:51.757 --> 09:56.846
For Dae-ho and you, could I say a prayer?

09:57.805 --> 09:58.973
Pardon?

09:59.432 --> 10:00.933
Give me your hand.

10:02.852 --> 10:07.106
Our dear Lord,
thank you for your generosity.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.276
You've given us…

10:13.237 --> 10:15.615
About 20 years now.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.367
Are you shocked?

10:19.076 --> 10:22.496
I'm sure Dae-ho is your alias.
What's your real name?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.206
Enough!

10:24.290 --> 10:25.541
Who cares?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.253
I am his foster mother after all.
I should know.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.342
I like his reticent personality.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.866
Come in.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.881
Go and rest now.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.091
This way.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.106
This is your room.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.663
You must be tired.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.010
Who'd suspect a teen agent, right?

12:01.053 --> 12:04.014
No good will come from getting involved.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.142
Why?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.521
Will he rob our safe?

12:10.604 --> 12:13.232
Until the package is shipped,
don't leave the house unattended.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.643
Which unit?

12:50.352 --> 12:51.812
Unit 8, Special Ops.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.398
You must be well-trained, then.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.277
There's only one rule here.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.323
Stay out of our business.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.534
Then we won't take an interest
in yours, either.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.996
I was looking forward
to a new family member.

13:09.079 --> 13:13.417
No need for strong words
at our first dinner.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.548
You have to wake up early tomorrow.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.467
Students study really hard here.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.595
From sunrise till midnight.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.267
Are you serious?

13:48.369 --> 13:50.871
Everyone, attention!

13:51.830 --> 13:53.916
We've got a new transfer student.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.168
Introduce yourself.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.922
My name is Kang Dae-ho.
I'm pleased to meet you.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.509
That was dull.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.095
Take that empty seat.

14:08.180 --> 14:14.228
I'm begging you,
don't use cell phones in class.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.105
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.690
Dismissed.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.786
Buddy, get the hell out.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.420
Lee Hye-in, where were you yesterday?

14:40.254 --> 14:42.423
Hye-in, got our money yet?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.135
Let's do some accounting later.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.722
She's mute again.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.767
She never answers right away.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.645
What do you think?

14:59.815 --> 15:01.025
My heart just stopped.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.902
I'll fucking whup you.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.162
Check out his fierce eyes.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.372
Stand down, boy.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.085
What a piece of work.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.758
He's been working out.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.719
Stand the fuck down, asshole.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.806
Jackpot! Brand-new bills!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.559
So much money!

15:35.643 --> 15:39.772
If you don't want trouble,
keep your mouth shut.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.817
Who's this?

15:43.901 --> 15:46.654
She's cute, who is she?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.490
She looks Chinese, though.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.283
I think this fuck's from Yanbian.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.286
Are you from Yanbian? Korean-Chinese?

15:58.499 --> 16:00.042
Take the wallet and walk away.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.462
What the fuck's this?

16:04.421 --> 16:06.298
You asswipes!

16:07.091 --> 16:08.884
I saw this coming.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.804
Come here. You heard me!

16:12.638 --> 16:13.847
Let's go.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.692
Just my luck.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.908
One, two, three…

16:34.868 --> 16:36.787
Again.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
And down.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.681
Once more.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.476
What happened to your face?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.857
Did they hurt you?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.738
Is your name Lee Hye-in?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.031
Yeah.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.075
Why are they bothering you?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.539
No reason at all.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.377
And down.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.422
I was never here.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.349
What is it?

19:02.182 --> 19:05.477
So, who got caught
playing games during class?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.437
You? Or you?

19:07.563 --> 19:08.814
It's you, then.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.195
I knew you were up to no good!

19:17.030 --> 19:19.324
Those of you who were late today,
raise your hand!

19:19.992 --> 19:21.243
Me!

19:22.870 --> 19:26.915
Don't bother trying to skip cleaning duty.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.042
-Got it?
-Yes!

19:29.126 --> 19:30.711
-Dismissed!
-Dismissed!

19:34.089 --> 19:35.424
Hey, Yanbian!

19:36.175 --> 19:39.636
Hear that? Clean the windows, too.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.430
Spotless.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.432
Don't wanna?

19:43.724 --> 19:45.601
You got a new friend to help you.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.769
I'll kill you if you take off.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.814
Get to it!

20:41.156 --> 20:43.867
<i>This is your mission in the South.</i>

20:44.743 --> 20:49.456
<i>The victims were all sleeper agents</i>
<i>from our unit.</i>

20:50.457 --> 20:53.752
<i>They must have been killed</i>
<i>by an agent from Section 35.</i>

20:57.339 --> 21:00.884
<i>Buk Doo-sung, Section 35's agent.</i>

21:01.551 --> 21:05.973
<i>First, make contact with our network</i>
<i>and gather the necessary gear.</i>

21:06.056 --> 21:07.599
<i>Find Buk and eliminate him.</i>

21:26.618 --> 21:28.829
Evening!

21:33.000 --> 21:34.251
You have it ready?

21:35.210 --> 21:36.461
I had a great dream.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.754
I see.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.474
I'd like a cake. No decorations.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.230
There are plenty of candles.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.331
BOXING CLUB

22:21.173 --> 22:23.550
-Who is it?
-Delivery.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.198
Who are you? Who sent you?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.116
Where's Buk Doo-sung?

22:48.742 --> 22:50.327
Never heard of him.

22:54.122 --> 22:59.044
One last time, where is Buk?

22:59.294 --> 23:03.006
Fuck… If I tell you, you'll let me live?

23:04.257 --> 23:06.218
Okay, wait!

23:08.053 --> 23:11.598
There's a guy who saw him once.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.768
He's a butcher.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.893
Take this!

23:57.811 --> 23:59.229
You're trash.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.064
Total trash.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.232
Clean it up.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.068
Take this, too.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.696
Here it is.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.781
Hurry up!

24:17.581 --> 24:19.916
Move! Clean it up!

24:20.083 --> 24:22.210
Hurry up!

24:22.294 --> 24:24.212
Come on, clean it up!

24:26.756 --> 24:28.258
What's with him?

24:29.885 --> 24:33.847
Yo, Yanbian, you two look good together.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.808
Have fun with her.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.768
Love between a Yanbian and a loner.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.520
Here, there's some more.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.522
They look so good!

24:48.361 --> 24:54.743
A, during the zygote's development,
the sex chromosomes do not separate.

24:54.951 --> 25:00.415
Or B, sperm's chromosomes do not separate.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.209
Hey, newbie.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.836
What did I just say?

25:04.920 --> 25:07.714
Solve question 18.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.269
The X chromosome comes from the mother,

25:21.353 --> 25:23.939
and nondisjunction in the father

25:24.022 --> 25:26.191
causes Turner Syndrome.

25:26.274 --> 25:29.361
It is a chromosomal abnormality

25:29.736 --> 25:32.572
in which all or part of
one of the sex chromosomes

25:32.656 --> 25:34.950
is absent or has other abnormalities,

25:35.033 --> 25:38.995
and not caused by
the remaining chromosomes.

25:41.164 --> 25:46.336
Since B and D are correct,
5 is the answer.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.298
Right, very good.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.469
Okay, let's move on to question 19.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.390
Check the remaining questions
with the answer sheet.

25:58.473 --> 25:59.432
Okay!

25:59.516 --> 26:00.767
Good work.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.651
Hye-in, let's try together.

27:43.870 --> 27:47.165
Sorry, I thought it was empty.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.086
I was just leaving.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.336
Don't just toss your shoes!

28:36.047 --> 28:39.134
What is it? Move aside.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.182
Yo, loner!

28:46.266 --> 28:48.601
What are you doing in our practice room?

28:50.353 --> 28:52.147
Did you dance?

28:53.523 --> 28:55.316
She danced!

28:58.445 --> 29:01.948
Can't you see I'm talking to you?

29:02.031 --> 29:04.200
Dance for us.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.495
If you're good, you can use this room.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.206
I heard you danced in middle school.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.419
PHARMACY

29:19.924 --> 29:21.760
-All here.
-All here.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.307
He’s with us, don't worry.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.350
Go to sleep now.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.270
Who's that?

29:32.353 --> 29:33.480
Son.

29:34.856 --> 29:35.815
Son?

29:35.899 --> 29:37.776
He fell from the sky.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.403
Where are you going at this hour?

29:40.487 --> 29:42.781
Must I report my tasks to you?

29:42.864 --> 29:45.325
You should have said someone was upstairs.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.743
I didn't want to.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.746
Here!

29:54.918 --> 29:56.628
It's a black Grandeur.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.630
This is his license plate.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.258
That's all I know.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.302
Please, don't kill--

32:27.487 --> 32:29.197
Look into the motorcycle first.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.949
Yes, sir.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.746
There's no one here!

33:26.671 --> 33:28.297
Let's go inside.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.557
Holy shit!

33:39.392 --> 33:41.561
-Good work.
-Nice job, cutie.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.312
No.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.859
That's for my private lessons!

33:55.450 --> 33:56.659
He did it.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.288
It was him!

34:02.498 --> 34:04.876
-Who's that?
-Almost had a heart attack.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.254
You got business with us?

34:09.547 --> 34:10.715
You shit!

34:57.720 --> 34:59.597
Having fun? Think for once.

35:17.990 --> 35:20.368
Go kneel in the hall.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.464
It's him.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.186
When I get my cast off,
I'll make his asshole bleed.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.480
A bucket full, make sure of it.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.482
He fucking deserves to die!

35:51.566 --> 35:53.151
He's no joke, though.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.779
Look.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.322
There!

36:08.624 --> 36:11.794
Do you know where Hye-in works?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.443
What is it?

36:35.985 --> 36:37.570
I've got a migraine.

36:38.070 --> 36:42.617
Leave early? Sure, you're free to go.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.869
I'll give you a slip.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.710
Why are you looking for Hye-in?

36:53.044 --> 36:54.337
I'm just curious.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.925
I heard she's quitting school
to work somewhere else,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.177
but I don't know the details.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.393
Dae-ho!

37:12.730 --> 37:14.398
It's your uniform.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.447
Been well?

37:24.700 --> 37:25.910
You cut your hair.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.627
Why aren't you coming to school?

37:37.171 --> 37:38.714
I found something I want to do.

37:45.554 --> 37:46.597
I'll be going now.

37:48.683 --> 37:49.892
Dae-ho!

37:52.561 --> 37:54.230
I need a favor.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.071
Okay.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.457
-Hello.
-Afternoon.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.501
-Did you come together?
-Yes.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.422
Big brother!

38:24.260 --> 38:25.344
Come here!

38:37.315 --> 38:38.816
PART-TIME JOB CONSENT FORM

38:49.785 --> 38:52.788
LEE DAE-HO

39:06.385 --> 39:11.265
OLDER BROTHER

39:14.685 --> 39:16.479
What's with the rain?

39:18.481 --> 39:19.482
Wait here.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.456
Take this!

39:35.539 --> 39:38.542
Brother, please stop!

39:39.335 --> 39:41.796
Please stop!

39:43.589 --> 39:45.257
Jun-su!

39:46.550 --> 39:48.594
I told you not to bother your sister.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.971
You have to be good!

39:58.479 --> 39:59.855
Shall we?

40:08.864 --> 40:10.074
Come on!

40:17.957 --> 40:19.500
Thank you, big brother.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.630
You like hearing that?

40:27.091 --> 40:31.554
All guys without a sibling
go gaga over that.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.098
I have a sister.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.642
Really?

40:38.227 --> 40:39.478
Same name as you.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.356
How old is she?

40:46.193 --> 40:47.862
Getting too personal?

40:48.404 --> 40:49.780
Fine.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.994
Are you really from Yanbian?

41:20.144 --> 41:23.189
Is there anywhere you want to go?

41:25.941 --> 41:27.610
I never thought of that.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.155
Do you have somewhere in mind?

41:34.074 --> 41:35.910
Somewhere no one knows me.

41:38.245 --> 41:42.791
My parents passed away.
No other family, either.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.132
It's okay.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.968
I come here when I miss them.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.640
My dream is in there.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.895
I threw my gum…

42:03.562 --> 42:05.231
and it stuck right here.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.861
I looked it up
and it has a famous dance company.

42:13.197 --> 42:17.284
They express themselves with dance.

42:20.246 --> 42:21.580
Isn't it great?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.418
Wanna try it?

42:27.545 --> 42:28.629
Dance?

42:29.922 --> 42:31.257
No, gum!

42:33.384 --> 42:34.760
Try it.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.680
Come on!

42:42.268 --> 42:43.310
Here.

42:52.194 --> 42:53.445
Do it properly.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.383
Dang it.

43:14.967 --> 43:17.094
Idiot, you should have aimed for Europe.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.679
You got it in the ocean.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.443
-This is where he lives?
-Yes, sir.

43:33.068 --> 43:38.282
It looked like the pharmacy
houses Unit 8's safe.

43:39.950 --> 43:44.204
PHARMACY

44:14.109 --> 44:16.111
What brings you…

44:36.882 --> 44:41.136
You know I don't live by loyalty.

44:48.519 --> 44:51.772
Let me live and I'll do anything.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.107
The package.

44:55.651 --> 44:59.530
Master bedroom safe.
The password is "sun prayer."

44:59.613 --> 45:03.200
See? Anything you want.

45:44.825 --> 45:47.077
Holy shit!

46:02.926 --> 46:06.305
If you disrupt this place,
you'll start a war.

46:31.872 --> 46:33.332
I got everything.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.047
Go ahead.

47:45.737 --> 47:48.198
A little young to be a killer.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.247
Here it is.

50:43.665 --> 50:46.668
Madam! Madam, drink with us.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.380
That's enough!

50:53.592 --> 50:56.720
I'm off for the day. Go next door.

50:58.388 --> 51:00.140
The pharmacy's closed.

51:03.226 --> 51:04.394
Yeah?

51:06.062 --> 51:07.814
Then wait a moment.

51:12.027 --> 51:16.448
-Madam, goodbye!
-See you!

51:26.291 --> 51:30.587
What a clumsy bastard.

51:34.466 --> 51:35.509
Here.

51:35.592 --> 51:38.804
It's the only place
that bought a Ducati last month.

51:39.596 --> 51:41.598
I'm certain it's this place.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.913
Boss, he looks different.

52:05.580 --> 52:06.623
Isn't it obvious?

52:07.290 --> 52:11.169
These sleeper agents
probably faked their identities.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.964
Check into this.

52:16.049 --> 52:17.175
Okay.

52:24.850 --> 52:28.436
They funneled around $30 million recently.

52:28.770 --> 52:30.272
It all went to the North?

52:30.355 --> 52:33.942
This also has to be
part of the succession power struggle

52:34.025 --> 52:37.821
between Unit 8 and Section 35.

52:42.492 --> 52:46.371
Write it up, and conclude that
this incident is a gas explosion.

52:46.913 --> 52:48.915
There's one more problem.

52:57.674 --> 52:58.884
What's this?

52:59.926 --> 53:02.137
He was adopted by the deceased.

53:20.906 --> 53:22.032
Look at you.

53:23.325 --> 53:28.580
You look like a young noble,
but eat like a dog.

53:29.998 --> 53:31.249
Lieutenant.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.171
-Is it always like this?
-What is?

53:36.713 --> 53:38.214
It's taking…

53:39.966 --> 53:41.718
far longer than I thought.

53:41.968 --> 53:42.969
Look here.

53:44.012 --> 53:47.557
Do you know what my first mission
in three years is?

53:50.602 --> 53:53.271
To feed your sorry ass.

53:56.691 --> 54:00.195
It's only been a month. Wait it out.

54:02.447 --> 54:05.909
Unless they abandon us,

54:05.992 --> 54:08.286
all you can do is be patient.

54:11.665 --> 54:16.461
Don't call me "lieutenant."
It's "Granny" to you.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.186
Stop!

54:35.397 --> 54:37.023
Madam!

54:38.942 --> 54:40.944
Doing well?

54:41.736 --> 54:43.405
Hard at work?

54:44.447 --> 54:45.407
Your grandson?

54:45.824 --> 54:49.953
Like hell! Come by after work.

54:50.036 --> 54:51.830
Have a drink on me.

54:52.455 --> 54:54.374
Sounds good, I will!

54:54.457 --> 54:57.669
Okay, be careful now!

55:05.677 --> 55:10.098
Write "spy" on your forehead,
why don't you?

55:11.349 --> 55:12.642
Idiot.

55:18.606 --> 55:21.276
Come on now, relax.

55:22.652 --> 55:25.030
You can just walk away casually.

55:30.785 --> 55:32.579
How old are you?

55:34.706 --> 55:36.207
Twenty this year.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.004
Any family?

55:43.548 --> 55:45.258
My parents passed away…

55:51.389 --> 55:53.016
and only my sister left.

55:53.892 --> 55:55.143
Is that so?

55:57.562 --> 55:58.855
Isn't she pretty?

55:59.522 --> 56:00.648
Let me see.

56:03.651 --> 56:08.031
She looks so beautiful.

56:09.741 --> 56:11.534
She's very energetic.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.961
Is that your father?

56:41.564 --> 56:44.150
PYONGYANG

56:51.491 --> 56:55.578
Shouldn't we tighten the noose on 35?

56:56.121 --> 56:59.415
To make our move, we need our funds back.

57:00.542 --> 57:03.962
Don't worry, preparations are under way.

57:14.430 --> 57:17.267
PIANO TUNING

57:28.862 --> 57:30.822
-Mr. Kang Dae-ho?
-Yes.

57:59.225 --> 58:00.852
Why haven't you called?

58:01.936 --> 58:04.022
The situation's complicated here.

58:04.689 --> 58:07.609
The Party decided
to give you a bigger role.

58:08.067 --> 58:09.819
Don't let us down.

58:11.237 --> 58:14.240
Remember the incident at the pharmacy?

58:15.325 --> 58:18.244
Don't think too hard. We'll hit them back.

58:19.078 --> 58:20.497
Is Hye-in doing well?

58:22.665 --> 58:24.042
Don't you worry.

58:24.334 --> 58:29.547
<i>It's your last mission.</i>
<i>Bring back what was taken.</i>

58:29.631 --> 58:34.010
<i>Then you can meet your sister.</i>

59:03.957 --> 59:05.333
<i>Brother.</i>

59:06.251 --> 59:09.837
<i>I heard you'll be back in a few days,</i>

59:10.547 --> 59:14.425
<i>so I'm making this as a present for you.</i>

59:15.260 --> 59:16.636
<i>Myung-hoon…</i>

59:17.428 --> 59:20.181
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

59:54.090 --> 59:56.175
Thank you for coming all this way.

59:56.926 --> 1:00:00.263
I didn't realize
a liaison officer would come.

1:00:00.346 --> 1:00:03.057
It's important enough for me to come.

1:00:03.141 --> 1:00:04.350
This way, please.

1:00:09.105 --> 1:00:11.190
Please sit here, sir.

1:00:13.401 --> 1:00:14.485
The package?

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:18.072
Street value is $30 million.

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:21.117
I organized it for your convenience.

1:00:38.926 --> 1:00:40.053
Who the hell--

1:00:42.972 --> 1:00:44.349
We've got an intruder!

1:00:44.432 --> 1:00:45.683
Sung-hoon!

1:00:50.772 --> 1:00:52.357
Go outside and check!

1:01:05.662 --> 1:01:07.246
We have to move, sir.

1:01:08.748 --> 1:01:11.668
Officer, what about us? Comrade?

1:02:08.516 --> 1:02:09.726
Give it to me.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:18.609
Why did they call the meet?
Off the record, too.

1:02:19.444 --> 1:02:22.905
They probably want a cover-up,
God damn it.

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.242
Let's talk after the Beijing trip.

1:03:00.777 --> 1:03:01.861
Good work.

1:03:02.904 --> 1:03:08.576
It's been a while since someone returned.

1:03:14.749 --> 1:03:15.958
What's this?

1:03:18.711 --> 1:03:21.422
Well, well, well!

1:03:21.923 --> 1:03:24.467
Just look at this tacky color!

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:29.055
I hope to see you back home.

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:34.894
Nonsense. My duty is to be
the backbone of our revolution.

1:03:35.603 --> 1:03:38.564
Leave everything behind when you go.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:43.069
Go back to being a youth.

1:03:43.653 --> 1:03:48.407
Stay immature as long as possible, got it?

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:57.792
I have to get ready. You go on now.

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:17.562
Granny…

1:04:20.982 --> 1:04:22.525
please stay healthy.

1:04:24.902 --> 1:04:29.198
Don't you worry about me. Go on now!

1:05:08.279 --> 1:05:09.405
Dae-ho?

1:05:19.624 --> 1:05:21.208
What brings you here?

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:26.088
I'm going somewhere.

1:05:27.506 --> 1:05:30.176
Where? Far away?

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:33.888
To meet my sister.

1:05:42.229 --> 1:05:43.731
That's great.

1:05:51.155 --> 1:05:52.657
Keep in touch?

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:50.381
Here for the boat?

1:06:51.507 --> 1:06:52.800
Yes.

1:06:52.883 --> 1:06:54.719
Come inside first.

1:06:58.639 --> 1:07:01.559
BEIJING

1:07:04.770 --> 1:07:08.441
Can I trust this intel?

1:07:08.524 --> 1:07:15.031
We'll take the heat
and hand over all Unit 8 agents,

1:07:15.114 --> 1:07:16.657
and you don't want it?

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:20.661
This is taking the heat?
More like a slap in the face!

1:07:20.786 --> 1:07:22.246
Be quiet.

1:07:22.955 --> 1:07:23.956
Listen carefully.

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:32.214
The era of great ruler Kim Jong-Un
will begin soon.

1:07:33.132 --> 1:07:37.636
Who did you say was the great ruler?

1:07:38.971 --> 1:07:41.724
You'll have to figure out

1:07:41.807 --> 1:07:46.562
how you'll maintain a relationship
with Section 35.

1:08:01.118 --> 1:08:02.453
Did you get the package?

1:08:03.829 --> 1:08:05.247
I have it with me.

1:08:07.374 --> 1:08:08.834
Where's your home?

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:11.754
Pyongyang, Usungdong.

1:08:12.838 --> 1:08:19.470
It's five hours to Heju Harbor.
You'll have breakfast at home.

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:22.556
Great.

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:31.357
What the hell?

1:08:32.608 --> 1:08:34.860
Sir, must we do this?

1:08:35.152 --> 1:08:36.320
<i>Yes!</i>

1:08:36.779 --> 1:08:37.947
<i>Do it!</i>

1:08:38.322 --> 1:08:40.324
It's a commie sweep job, so why not?

1:08:40.783 --> 1:08:44.620
More like cleaning up
after their bitch fight!

1:08:44.703 --> 1:08:46.497
<i>It'll still be clean.</i>

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:50.251
Let's say it's a power struggle,
as you said.

1:08:50.334 --> 1:08:52.336
If we defuse the situation like this…

1:08:53.504 --> 1:08:56.674
This is from the top. Get it done!

1:08:56.757 --> 1:08:58.175
<i>Sir!</i>

1:09:03.389 --> 1:09:04.640
<i>God damn it.</i>

1:09:38.465 --> 1:09:39.592
What are you doing?

1:09:45.931 --> 1:09:48.809
You're quite naive.

1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:56.525
Who ordered you?

1:10:00.362 --> 1:10:01.822
Who ordered you?

1:10:03.115 --> 1:10:04.909
No agent has ever returned home.

1:10:05.701 --> 1:10:08.329
But that doesn't mean you can live here.

1:10:44.281 --> 1:10:46.200
Wait!

1:10:46.575 --> 1:10:48.869
You look so scary!

1:10:49.578 --> 1:10:51.497

1:11:11.016 --> 1:11:13.477

1:11:13.978 --> 1:11:14.937
Don't move!

1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:16.021
Granny!

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:17.898
-Go away!
-What are you doing?

1:11:17.982 --> 1:11:19.650
Lower your knife, please.

1:11:19.733 --> 1:11:23.612

1:11:23.946 --> 1:11:25.739

1:11:26.031 --> 1:11:29.243
I've still got some fight in me!

1:11:38.085 --> 1:11:42.172
Why are you still around?

1:11:44.091 --> 1:11:45.676
Get out of here!

1:11:51.265 --> 1:11:52.975
-I'll kill you all!
-Don't shoot!

1:11:56.895 --> 1:11:58.147
Granny.

1:12:08.324 --> 1:12:13.579
Go back alive…

1:12:30.012 --> 1:12:31.055
Freeze.

1:12:43.484 --> 1:12:44.818

1:12:58.290 --> 1:13:00.542
Give yourself up. That's the only way.

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:03.796
How do you think we found you?

1:13:05.422 --> 1:13:07.299
The North has already abandoned you.

1:13:10.386 --> 1:13:12.262

1:13:14.223 --> 1:13:15.557

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:45.582
Dae-ho, what's wrong?

1:15:51.797 --> 1:15:53.590
I shouldn't have come here.

1:16:00.430 --> 1:16:01.890
You can't go like that!

1:16:02.849 --> 1:16:04.476
I know you're on the run.

1:16:22.327 --> 1:16:23.579
What are you saying?

1:16:26.707 --> 1:16:28.125
You're my friend!

1:16:37.092 --> 1:16:38.885
I don't have any friends.

1:17:14.004 --> 1:17:18.008
I'll bring it back for sure.

1:17:20.927 --> 1:17:26.308
I was his handler.
I can get in touch with him.

1:17:31.980 --> 1:17:34.399
That was quite amusing.

1:17:38.654 --> 1:17:40.280

1:35:30.307 --> 1:35:32.017
Let me talk to him.

1:35:36.981 --> 1:35:38.274
<i>Give yourself up.</i>

1:35:39.150 --> 1:35:41.485
<i>I know what's happening to you.</i>

1:35:44.530 --> 1:35:46.323
<i>Come see your sister.</i>

1:35:48.075 --> 1:35:50.870
<i>-There's something I must do.</i>
-Myung-hoon.

1:35:53.497 --> 1:35:58.878
I'll come tomorrow, after it's done.

1:37:15.162 --> 1:37:16.372
Hello?

1:37:17.373 --> 1:37:18.582
<i>Myung-hoon?</i>

1:37:20.084 --> 1:37:21.210
<i>Myung-hoon?</i>

1:37:27.049 --> 1:37:30.010
Triangulate this call, on the double!

1:37:43.983 --> 1:37:45.776
I knew this would happen.

1:37:46.277 --> 1:37:50.447
Unnecessary emotions
will get you in the end.

1:37:59.331 --> 1:38:00.499
Where is she?

1:38:42.333 --> 1:38:43.917
These meaningless stones…

1:38:46.629 --> 1:38:48.130
you thought I'd keep them?

1:38:53.093 --> 1:39:00.017
You're still a child,
a long way from adulthood.

1:39:00.768 --> 1:39:02.770
You can't do this to me.

1:39:07.858 --> 1:39:10.110
I followed all your orders.

1:39:10.194 --> 1:39:15.282
I wanted to make you our nation's hero.

1:39:18.702 --> 1:39:20.037
But you…

1:39:24.291 --> 1:39:26.001
made me a killer.

1:40:11.839 --> 1:40:14.633
Are you hurt? Do as I say.

1:40:27.062 --> 1:40:28.731
Resilient fuck.

1:40:40.868 --> 1:40:41.869
You okay?

1:41:43.972 --> 1:41:45.015
Let's go.

1:41:49.353 --> 1:41:50.354
Dae-ho!

1:41:51.104 --> 1:41:52.397
Go!

1:41:54.316 --> 1:41:55.609
Go!

1:42:03.909 --> 1:42:05.452
Get out of here!

1:42:15.712 --> 1:42:17.005
Sir…

1:42:41.947 --> 1:42:45.576
Motherfucker, my diamonds…

1:42:47.119 --> 1:42:48.245
You're finished.

1:42:53.250 --> 1:42:54.626
Moon Sang-chul!

1:42:55.419 --> 1:42:56.795
Don't move!

1:42:57.921 --> 1:42:59.214
It's all over!

1:43:01.341 --> 1:43:03.135
It's far from over!

1:43:04.011 --> 1:43:09.433
Comrade Li, if you want to live,
shoot him.

1:43:09.516 --> 1:43:12.477
Myung-hoon, drop your gun.

1:43:25.449 --> 1:43:26.867
What can I do?

1:43:30.579 --> 1:43:32.623
I can't even go back.

1:43:37.085 --> 1:43:38.086
This must be the end.

1:43:43.759 --> 1:43:44.927
Myung-hoon!

1:43:45.886 --> 1:43:47.137
Myung-hoon!

1:45:18.478 --> 1:45:20.063
I have to go.

1:45:22.649 --> 1:45:24.609
She's waiting for me.

1:45:37.998 --> 1:45:39.583
I'm sorry.

1:48:04.102 --> 1:48:06.897
You must be Hye-in.

1:48:10.066 --> 1:48:13.904
Are you Hye-in, too?

1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:17.032
Yeah.

1:48:24.539 --> 1:48:28.084
Hye-in, wanna take a walk?

1:48:38.261 --> 1:48:39.846
<i>You said to me once</i>

1:48:41.348 --> 1:48:44.768
<i>that you wanted to be somewhere</i>
<i>no one knew you.</i>

1:48:44.851 --> 1:48:47.520
How do you know my brother?

1:48:49.272 --> 1:48:50.190
How?

1:48:50.273 --> 1:48:53.568
<i>How nice would it be, if I could, too?</i>

1:48:53.652 --> 1:48:55.445
We were classmates.

1:48:57.113 --> 1:49:00.116
My brother and you
went to the same school?

1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:03.370
<i>I lived here as Kang Dae-ho…</i>

1:49:04.579 --> 1:49:09.376
<i>but when I was with you,</i>
<i>I found myself again.</i>

1:49:13.421 --> 1:49:15.006
<i>Thank you, Hye-in.</i>

1:49:18.134 --> 1:49:21.179
<i>My name is Li Myung-hoon.</i>
