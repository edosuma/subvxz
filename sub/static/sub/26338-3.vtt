03:48.489 --> 03:51.056
both made
from transparent explosives,

03:51.100 --> 03:52.841
detonated in Morocco.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.146

03:54.190 --> 03:55.931
were still
in the theoretical phase.

the theoretical phase, Mac.

took out

Uh, transparent bombs
are cutting-edge explosives.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.601
They're made from thin,
see-through, volatile material

to cover any object.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.393
The material stolen,
when combined,

04:23.437 --> 04:25.874
gave the thieves
everything they needed

04:25.917 --> 04:29.704
to build the world's
first two transparent bombs.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.096

04:31.140 --> 04:34.970

at Western Tech.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.973
After graduation,

04:38.016 --> 04:41.063
each went to work for one
of the three R & D firms

04:41.106 --> 04:42.325
that was just robbed.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.979
So these three
are working together?

04:44.022 --> 04:46.329
No. And this is where
it gets strange.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.157
They all graduated
different years,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.115
and as far as we can tell,
they never

04:50.159 --> 04:52.204
crossed paths
at school or after.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.510
How do three people

04:53.554 --> 04:54.903
who have never come in contact
with each other

04:54.946 --> 04:57.122
manage to build
a high

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
48 hours before the thefts
took place,

04:58.950 --> 05:02.214
all three received e-mails
giving them the green light

05:02.258 --> 05:04.173
to proceed with their mission.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.610
So someone's recruiting sleeper
agents out of Western Tech.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.003
MATTY:
It appears so.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.657
And we have no idea who,

05:09.700 --> 05:12.703
because after Caroline, Kyle,
and Nick completed their task,

05:12.747 --> 05:14.401
all three were murdered.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.533
Damn. That's just cold.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.143
None of these students
seem like the type

05:18.187 --> 05:19.493
to betray their country,

05:19.536 --> 05:22.191
so how did they get recruited?

05:22.234 --> 05:23.410
Maybe these three, at first,

05:23.453 --> 05:24.846
thought that they
were being recruited

05:24.889 --> 05:26.326
into a collegiate
secret society.

get this straight.

or rush parties.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.657

are going undercover

05:53.701 --> 05:55.659
to smoke out a skilled handler

of domestic terrorists.

Want to come inside

Tempting. But, uh,
I have a test in about an hour.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.851
Do you guys think you could turn
the music down a little bit

09:50.894 --> 09:52.722
so I can get some
studying done

09:52.766 --> 09:54.898
That's what

09:54.942 --> 09:57.292
Yeah, as if
you've ever been there.

09:57.335 --> 10:00.164
I've been there. Once.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.633
You should come.
Bring her.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.461

I was saying
these e-mails go back to '08.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.690
Factoring this in,
we uncovered that

10:47.734 --> 10:49.300
every time a message goes out,

10:49.344 --> 10:52.129
an attack happens less
than 24 hours later.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.131
Guys, we uncovered a pattern.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.350
MacGYVER:
Yeah. A pattern

10:55.393 --> 10:56.960
we could use
to connect this ring

10:57.004 --> 10:58.527
to a decade's worth
of unsolved bombings.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.225
The recruiter has been at
Western Tech at least that long,

11:01.269 --> 11:02.879
so it can't be a student.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.142
I've had our techs start looking
into the profiles

11:05.186 --> 11:06.666
of every staff and faculty

11:06.709 --> 11:08.406
member there with this in mind.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.234
We've come up with a suspect.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.888
Elliot Lambeau,

11:11.932 --> 11:14.804
Professor of Material Science
and Engineering.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.806
Material science-- that means
he'd have the, uh, knowledge

11:16.850 --> 11:19.461
and skill needed
to make transparent bombs.BOZER: And look, he's been

11:19.504 --> 11:21.202
arrested a dozen times
since he started teaching here

11:21.245 --> 11:23.030
at protests that
turned violent.
LEANNA:
And a lot

11:23.073 --> 11:24.684
of the graduates involved
in these attacks

11:24.727 --> 11:26.207
took his class
over the years.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.557
This has got to be our guy.
We should pay him a visit.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.124
He just started a lecture.

11:30.167 --> 11:33.040
Mac, go sit in on his class
and get a read on him.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.478
The rest of you, go find me
evidence he's our recruiter.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.001
The stress parallel
to the slope

11:38.045 --> 11:39.437
that pulls the object
in the downslope

11:39.481 --> 11:41.788
direction parallel
to the slope.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.441
So... Excuse me?

11:43.485 --> 11:44.486
Do you have a cell phone?

11:44.529 --> 11:46.140
Um... yeah.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.837
Do you need it?

11:47.881 --> 11:50.187
And on that phone on the top,
right in the middle is what?

11:50.231 --> 11:53.016
The...
The answer
I'm looking for is a clock.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.192
So there was no reason
for you to be 32 minutes

11:55.236 --> 11:57.151
late to my lecture, Mister...?

11:57.194 --> 11:58.935
MacGyver.
Mm. Come here.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.502
Come over here.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.113
Since you didn't think it was
important to join us on time,

12:03.157 --> 12:04.854
I can only assume
that you've already

12:04.898 --> 12:07.770
mastered the engineering
principles of slope stability.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.120
So, there is an...

12:10.164 --> 12:13.515
object at the bottom
of this box.

12:13.558 --> 12:17.084
I want you to retrieve it
using those principles.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.392
MacGYVER:
Um...

12:21.436 --> 12:24.787
with all due respect, there's
an easier way to do this.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.789
Using the principles

12:26.833 --> 12:30.488
of fluidization,
I can "liquefy" the sand,

12:30.532 --> 12:32.490
which is a lot quicker

12:32.534 --> 12:34.057
than if I used the principles
of slope stability.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.552
Hmm.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.423
Well, that's certainly
one way to do it.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.079
But it's not the correct way.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.646
Go take a seat.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.828
Okay, Matty, we're
in Lambeau's office.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.917
MATTY: Guys, hurry up.
His class will be over soon.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.361
LEANNA:
Hold up, Bozer.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.233
That one's wired.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.017
If you open it, an
alarm will go off.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.933
Okay. No problem.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.109
I got this.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.503
Let's see.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.334
Did you learn
that from Mac?

13:33.377 --> 13:34.552
Nope.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.380
Learned this little trick

13:36.424 --> 13:38.208
while working on a student film.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.254
Heist movie.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.349
Guess film school was good
for something after all.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.918
I hope there's something
incriminating on that computer,

13:51.961 --> 13:55.225
Riley, 'cause all we got here
are tests waiting to be graded.

13:57.271 --> 14:01.797
You know, this Victor guy
doesn't seem that bad.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.755
All he's got's
a few petty thefts.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.367
Yeah, and then he graduated
to robbing convenience stores

14:06.410 --> 14:08.325
and stealing cars.Actually,

14:08.369 --> 14:12.025
you mean convenience "store" and
"car," both singular. Felonies,

14:12.068 --> 14:13.330
for sure, but
it's not like

14:13.374 --> 14:14.897
this guy's
a hardened war criminal

14:14.941 --> 14:17.465
or an international terrorist
or anything like that.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.293
Look, the flavor
of a criminal doesn't matter.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.772
A criminal is a criminal.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.165
That's not...

14:22.209 --> 14:24.167
In my experience,
it isn't always the case.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.908
Now listen to this.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.868
It says here that Victor's dad
died when he was 12,

14:28.911 --> 14:30.826
and his mother had...

14:30.870 --> 14:32.393
Oh, my gosh, I mean,
his mother had

14:32.436 --> 14:34.177
a litany of problems, so,

14:34.221 --> 14:35.962
this kid had
no parental guidance whatsoever.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.267
I mean, what's gonna happen?

14:37.311 --> 14:39.574
Tell me. Huh? Trouble.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.706
All right, you're reading
too far into this.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.579
You mind if I give you
a piece of advice?
Sure.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.015
Don't humanize the skip.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.799
It only makes the job harder.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.627
Now this guy jumped bail.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.717
I was hired to hunt him down,
not figure out why he did it.

14:52.761 --> 14:56.199
And is this super detached
emotional thing

14:56.243 --> 14:58.201
something you apply
only to work,

14:58.245 --> 15:00.029
or in your personal life?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.726
Now, is this your clever way

15:01.770 --> 15:03.815
of asking about my relationship
with Riley?

15:03.859 --> 15:05.339
Give that man a gold star.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.080
I knew you were
a smart guy, Billy.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.212
So, are you two
exclusive?

15:09.256 --> 15:11.171
Yeah, as far as I'm concerned,
we are.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.303
And do you see
a future in this,

15:13.347 --> 15:16.002
or are you just
having fun?

15:16.045 --> 15:18.004
Look, Jack...I would encourage you

15:18.047 --> 15:19.831
to choose your words
very carefully.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.877
Now, that-that's my little girl.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.491
I care for Riley... a lot.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.930
And I take this relationship
very seriously.

15:30.973 --> 15:34.107
So much so that I convinced
my mama to offer her a job.

15:34.150 --> 15:38.067
Wait, the Coltons
offered Riley a job?

15:41.027 --> 15:42.506
There.
In Louisiana?

15:42.550 --> 15:44.813
When did this happen?
What?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.119
You know, Riley,
the job interview.Jack, we got to cut him off.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.729
Well, answer the question.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.644
I'll stay on him,
you go around.Answer the question.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.080
[car door closes,
engine revs]

15:53.039 --> 15:54.997
Billy?
Jack, what the hell?!

15:55.041 --> 15:56.999
I told you to go around
so we could cut him off.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.523
My bad.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.873
MATTY:
Guys, Professor Lambeau's
class just ended.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.571
Please tell me
you're wrapping this up.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.661
I found something.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.663
He's got a hidden bank account.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.360
Whoa. That's way more

16:10.404 --> 16:12.623
than even a tenured professor
should be making.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.624
MATTY:
Could be the funding

16:13.668 --> 16:15.104
for his recruitment operation.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.714
Riley,
can you source this money?

16:16.758 --> 16:18.890
Yeah, I can,
but it's gonna take some time.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.327
Mac, stall him.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.462
Professor,
I'd like to apologize

16:25.506 --> 16:26.942
for being late to the lecture.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.988
I appreciate that,
Mr. MacGyver.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.033
:
You know...

16:31.077 --> 16:33.557
that was a pretty
advanced trick you pulled.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.298
Most students barely
have an answer,

16:35.342 --> 16:37.039
let alone show up
the professor

16:37.083 --> 16:39.085
after being put on
the spot in class.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.956
I wasn't trying
to show you up, but...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.350
just thinking outside
of the box is kind of my thing.

16:43.393 --> 16:46.092
Mm-hmm.
Why haven't I seen you before?

16:46.135 --> 16:48.790
I actually just transferred
from State, so...Uh-huh.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.618
And you clearly have a grasp
of the material.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.793
Why are you taking the course?

16:51.836 --> 16:54.274
All of your other lectures
were full

16:54.317 --> 16:56.928
and you and I share interests
in a lot of the same causes.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.496
Do we?

16:59.540 --> 17:00.889
Yeah.

17:03.326 --> 17:06.982
Well, we're gonna have
to pick this up on Monday.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.985
Uh, it would be great if I could
ask you a few more questions.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.857
Well, um... no,
I really... I have to go.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.207
It would be better
if you stayed.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.087
Mac, was that an explosion?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.568
Uh, yeah. Lambeau tried
to make a run for it.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.701
I said stall him, not stun him.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.355
Well, I did both.
He'll be fine.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.096
But is he our guy?
He was acting shady.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.532
Tried to hit me
with a microscope.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.099
RILEY:
Well, there's a reason for that.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.102
He is guilty, just not
of recruiting sleeper agents.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.625
He's been embezzling
department funds

17:41.669 --> 17:43.105
to funnel to his radical causes.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.498
Explains why he ran.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.282
He must have thought
you were an undercover cop, Mac.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.501
So we're back at square one.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.893
Actually, it's worse than that.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.243
While we were looking
into Lambeau,

17:50.286 --> 17:52.419
I just got another alert.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.638
Our recruiter just sent out
another e-mail.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.945
Which means something's going
down in the next 24 hours.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.995
MATTY: All right, people,
tell me we ID'd

18:04.039 --> 18:04.996
the student that received

18:05.040 --> 18:06.259
the recruiter's latest e-mail.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.522
The closest I can get is
pinpointing the hub

18:08.565 --> 18:10.263
on the network
where the e-mail was opened.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.569
Which should lead us to a dorm,
which would help us narrow down

18:12.613 --> 18:14.702
our suspects.

18:18.445 --> 18:21.012
There. I got a physical address.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.188
Which dorm is it?

18:22.231 --> 18:24.320
That's not a dorm.

18:24.364 --> 18:25.930
That's the Zeta Kappa Tau
frat house.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.106
Most likely, our
e-mail recipient

18:27.149 --> 18:28.542
is a member of that frat.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.152
So, if we can
identify them, it may

18:30.196 --> 18:31.588
lead us to whoever
sent the e-mail.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.373
The Zetas have 16 members.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.157
Any one of 'em could have
received that e-mail.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.419
Okay, how do we figure out

18:36.463 --> 18:37.812
which frat brother
is the right brother?

18:37.855 --> 18:39.509
We just need to find the one

18:39.553 --> 18:40.771
with this e-mail
on his computer.LEANNA: Easier said than done.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.686
We can't just waltz
to the front door

18:42.730 --> 18:45.776
and expect to get private time
alone with all 16 computers.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.170
Actually, we can. Tonight,
the house'll be packed. Should

18:48.214 --> 18:51.130
give Riley enough cover to slip
in and search the computers.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.653
It'll give us all
enough cover.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.263

24:21.111 --> 24:24.245
I'm sorry, did this dude

24:24.288 --> 24:26.421
Yes. They recruited me.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.596
Okay, if that's the case,
what's the name

24:27.640 --> 24:28.945

you've been working with?

24:28.989 --> 24:30.033

24:30.077 --> 24:31.644

24:31.687 --> 24:33.210
I have no idea.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.647
I was supposed to meet him
for the first time tonight.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.039
I was picking up a package.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.214
He's talking
about a bomb.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.086
The recruiter's planning
another attack.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.740

24:40.783 --> 24:43.438
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know. Um...

24:43.482 --> 24:45.135

GPS coordinates.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.616
I'm supposed to be there
in, like, 20 minutes.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.014
He's telling the truth.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.798
Well, then, we need
to get to this meeting now.

25:01.021 --> 25:06.113
I'm the king of the world!

25:06.156 --> 25:07.157

Bozer, get down.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.334

25:10.378 --> 25:12.249
Suddenly, I don't feel so great.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.990
Leanna, can you maybe slow down?

25:14.034 --> 25:15.514
If we're gonna ID
Simon's contact,

25:15.557 --> 25:16.645
fast is the only option.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.865
We are ten minutes late already.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.170
Leanna, you can't go
any faster, can you?

25:20.214 --> 25:21.781
My foot is literally
on the floor, Mac.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.260
Riley, any luck with the cameras
in the area?

25:23.304 --> 25:25.698
No. The only one
is three miles away

25:25.741 --> 25:27.351
from these GPS coordinates.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.092
This location
was chosen for a reason.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.399
Here you go.The CIA just confirmed

25:31.442 --> 25:32.748
what we already suspected.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.881
There's no officially sanctioned
Agency ops

25:34.924 --> 25:36.665
running out of Western Tech.

25:36.709 --> 25:39.494
This is a "false flag"
operation.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.583
So Simon's contact
is pretending to be CIA

25:41.627 --> 25:44.020
to trick students
into betraying the U.S.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.022
Okay, guys, satellite's up,
but perimeter's empty.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.110
There's nobody there.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.198
We missed the meeting.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.548
When Simon didn't show,

25:49.591 --> 25:50.461
they must've assumed
he'd been exposed.

25:50.505 --> 25:51.985
So we just lost our best chance

25:52.028 --> 25:53.160
to catch this guy.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.378
Now what?

25:54.422 --> 25:56.380
I dunno about you three,

25:56.424 --> 26:01.124
but I'm gonna try
really hard to not puke.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.692
No, that way. No.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.874
Oh, man.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.137
I'm having that dream
about the woods again.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.617
MATTY:
It's not a dream, Bozer.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.577
This is where Western Tech's
Meteorology Department

26:18.620 --> 26:20.274
conducts its weather
experiments.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.275
Hey. Look.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.842
There. That's a weather balloon.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.583
BOZER:
Maybe, or maybe it's
an alien orb.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.454
MacGYVER:
Trust me, it's a balloon.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.456
And that one should be able to
tell us who was here earlier.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.940
Leanna, I'm gonna need you
to start the car.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.652
Good job.

26:50.696 --> 26:54.221
I hate balloons, too.
And clouds.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.831
Okay, Mac, I'll bite.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.442
Other than pissing off
a few meteorology nerds,

26:58.486 --> 26:59.748
what's popping that thing
gonna do?

26:59.792 --> 27:02.403
Well, weather balloons can do
a lot of things.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.884
Including:
suspend a thermal camera

27:04.927 --> 27:06.494
high above a corn field

27:06.537 --> 27:10.759
to measure the heat impact
on crop yields.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.893
This camera, every ten seconds,

27:13.936 --> 27:16.983
was snapping a high, wide-angle
thermal photo

27:17.026 --> 27:21.640
of the field, including the road
that runs through it,

27:21.683 --> 27:23.467
to show the progression
of sun damage on crops.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.644
And since this is the
only road out here,

27:25.687 --> 27:27.689
whoever was meeting Simon
must've driven down it.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.517
Exactly. There may
be a photo on here

27:29.560 --> 27:31.214
that can help us
ID our recruiter.

27:36.872 --> 27:40.180
Guys, this car drove up
right before Simon's meeting,

27:40.223 --> 27:41.529
parked for five minutes
and then left.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.574
Gotta be his contact.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.447
Does everyone else see a red
squiggly shape or is it just me?

27:46.490 --> 27:48.362
No, it's not just you,
but we might be able to use

27:48.405 --> 27:51.104
that red squiggly shape to help
us ID Simon's contact.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.583
Yeah, look at
the heat signature.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.020
There's no engine.
It's running off a battery.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.283
It's an electric vehicle.Uh-huh.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.633
Matty, can, uh, you
run the chassis shape

27:58.677 --> 27:59.939
and see if you can
get a make and a model?

27:59.982 --> 28:01.592
If we do get a hit we can
cross-reference it

28:01.636 --> 28:03.377
with staff and faculty vehicles.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.379
I can, but it might take
some time.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.598
Right now, it's our only option.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.339
MATTY:
All right. Stand by for a name.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.602
BILLY: The guy I spoke with said
Victor's headed down here

28:11.646 --> 28:13.648
to sell some stuff
for some quick cash.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.954
But if he doesn't turn up,

28:14.997 --> 28:16.956
Mama's gonna be
pissed you lost him.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.523
So?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.351
She really doesn't like when
people mess with her money.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.831
Well, you tell Mama
I really don't like it

28:22.875 --> 28:25.268
when people mess
with my family.

28:25.312 --> 28:28.576
And I consider offering Riley
a job behind my back

28:28.619 --> 28:30.752
messing with my family.
She's with us now.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.581
Okay, for the record,
that wasn't my intent.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.366
I just-- I don't want
to think about a future

a future with you,

a little girl, right?

28:51.904 --> 28:54.733

Riley decides

28:54.776 --> 28:56.604

that's her decision.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.693

your position say

29:46.567 --> 29:47.655

29:47.698 --> 29:48.830
Yeah. I'm sure they do.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.223
But, look, if you take me in

29:50.266 --> 29:51.528

happen to her.

29:53.879 --> 29:54.967
Happen to who?

29:55.010 --> 29:56.795
My mom.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.710
What's the matter with her?

29:59.754 --> 30:01.451
24-hour care isn't cheap.

30:05.499 --> 30:06.892
She's so behind in
payments as is,

30:06.935 --> 30:09.720
I just... I needed that money.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.810

Look, I'm trying to
sell everything I can.

30:14.508 --> 30:15.857
That's why I came here.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.859
And I got friends,
they owe me money and...

30:17.903 --> 30:19.818
If I can just get that money

30:19.861 --> 30:22.777
and pay off
her bills,

30:22.821 --> 30:24.126
I will turn myself in.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.241
Jack.

30:52.285 --> 30:55.070
Yeah.What are you doing?
Did he come this way?

30:55.114 --> 30:57.507
No, no, no. I came
around the corner. I seen this.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.988
So he-- I don't know--
he must've doubled back.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.207
No, he didn't.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.382
He didn't.

Yeah, okay.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.790
MATTY:
Julian Sloane,

31:19.834 --> 31:21.270
I'm Matilda Webber,

31:21.314 --> 31:23.882
and I work for an agency
you never heard of.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.536
You have a lot of explaining
to do, Ms. Webber.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.930
Your people just kidnapped me
off the street.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.585
Oh, you want to play
private citizen? Fine.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.630
But you're not really
a citizen of this country,

31:33.674 --> 31:36.111
are you, Mischa Burov?

31:36.155 --> 31:38.722
Born in Moscow, 1963.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.724
Joined the KGB in 1981.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.378
In 1985, you were sent

31:42.422 --> 31:44.163
to the States to recruit spies.

31:44.206 --> 31:45.991
And in 1986, you applied

31:46.034 --> 31:48.732
to the Western Tech
Admissions Department

31:48.776 --> 31:50.778
under the name Julian Sloane.

31:50.821 --> 31:51.735
You were hired

31:51.779 --> 31:53.215
and since worked your way up

31:53.259 --> 31:54.651
to head of admissions.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.349
Then, in '91,
the USSR crumbled.

31:56.392 --> 31:57.741
So, what did you do?

31:57.785 --> 31:58.960
You turned your recruitment ring

31:59.004 --> 32:00.570
into a private
moneymaking operation.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.181
Working in the admissions
department gave you

32:02.224 --> 32:04.879
access to students' profiles
and records,

32:04.923 --> 32:08.883
allowing you the opportunity to
handpick who you wanted to admit

32:08.927 --> 32:10.189
and recruit.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.625
A nice story.

32:11.668 --> 32:12.974
But it's just a story.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.977
Except it isn't. I've got
ten years of e-mails

32:16.021 --> 32:17.936
sent from your account
to your student recruits

32:17.979 --> 32:19.024
ordering dozens
of bombings.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.590
LEANNA: Bombings
that directly correlate

32:20.634 --> 32:22.984
to deposits made into your
offshore bank account. Oh, yeah.

32:23.028 --> 32:23.985
We found that, too.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.987
Your last three deposits
all came

32:26.031 --> 32:28.859
from the same place, which
tells me that you were hired

32:28.903 --> 32:30.861
to set off three bombs.

32:30.905 --> 32:32.776
Two already detonated.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.561
So where's the third, Mischa?

32:34.604 --> 32:36.563
We know you didn't make
the handoff to Simon.

32:36.606 --> 32:39.044
And there's no bomb in your car,
your office, or your home.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.871
Which means
you planted it yourself.

32:40.915 --> 32:44.005
The only way to stay out of jail
for the rest of your life

32:44.049 --> 32:46.703
is to tell us where that third
bomb is before it goes off.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.444
What was Simon's target?

32:51.795 --> 32:53.928
Turn on the news at 9:00.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.278
All your questions
will be answered.

32:59.890 --> 33:02.023
MATTY: It's just after
8:00 a.m., which gives us less

33:02.067 --> 33:04.504
than an hour
before that third bomb goes off.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.245
That's just not
a lot of time.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.464
GPS in Sloane's car
has been turned off.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.118
There's no way to tell
where he's been.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.294
The, uh, time stamp
on the weather balloon photos,

33:12.338 --> 33:15.384
it said that Sloane drove away
from the cornfield at 2:00 a.m.,

33:15.428 --> 33:17.430
and we grabbed him at 7:00 a.m.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.171
So he drove two and half hours
max to the target

33:19.214 --> 33:20.346
and two and a half hours back.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.870
The list of potential targets
is massive.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.351
Okay, let's review
what we already know.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.005
The students involved
in these attacks

33:27.048 --> 33:28.658
used their employee access

33:28.702 --> 33:30.486
to sneak the bombs
into the buildings.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.053
What did Simon have access to?

33:32.097 --> 33:35.839
Well, he's a Chinese
and business double major.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.624
Did a semester abroad

33:37.667 --> 33:40.148
interning
at the Shanghai National Bank.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.932
Shanghai doesn't fit
our timetable.

33:41.976 --> 33:44.848
No. But the Shanghai
National Bank does have

33:44.892 --> 33:46.067
a corporate services branch

33:46.111 --> 33:48.983
located on the 20th floor
of a building

33:49.027 --> 33:50.898
half an hour from Western Tech.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.031
Well, that's got
to be the target.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.728
RILEY: Without Simon's access,
Sloane couldn't have snuck

33:54.771 --> 33:56.860
his bomb into the bank.
So where'd he hide it?

33:56.904 --> 34:00.038
MATTY: Probably somewhere in the
building he could easily access.

34:00.081 --> 34:00.864
Like the lobby?

34:00.908 --> 34:02.649
Like the lobby. Go. Now.

34:14.574 --> 34:22.669
RILEY: Damn it.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.105
I can't see it anywhere.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
Isn't that the whole point
of a transparent bomb?

34:25.759 --> 34:26.890
It can't be seen
to the naked eye?

34:26.934 --> 34:28.457
BOZER: Yeah,
but it's not invisible.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.155
Got to be some way
to detect it, right There is.

34:30.198 --> 34:32.461
It's called an induced
secondary emission generator.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.767
Do all those big words mean

34:33.810 --> 34:34.811
"transparent bomb
finder"?

34:34.855 --> 34:36.030
Pretty much.

34:36.074 --> 34:36.987
When I pass this
over the bomb,

34:37.031 --> 34:38.685
it will shoot ions at it,

34:38.728 --> 34:39.816
causing it to glow orange.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.602
The fire department's
on its way.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.125

34:44.169 --> 34:45.735
Yep. We are nearly there.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
Mac, you have 20 minutes

34:47.650 --> 34:48.956

before it goes off.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.479
So, no pressure.

Thanks.

Solar panels have
hydrogen fuel cells.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.993
We were able
to connect the dots

37:37.037 --> 37:40.649
between the two attacks in
Morocco and Shanghai National.

37:40.693 --> 37:41.998
Turns out
the Moroccan government

37:42.042 --> 37:44.523
was doubling its efforts
to fight terrorism

37:44.566 --> 37:46.525
and secured a loan
at the Chinese bank

37:46.568 --> 37:48.918
to fund both
a weapons development facility

37:48.962 --> 37:51.834
and a training center
for their anti-terrorist troops.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.793
Oh, so a local radical group

37:53.836 --> 37:54.750
was trying to hurt
the government's efforts

37:54.794 --> 37:55.969
to stop terrorism.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.797
Yeah. And they hired Sloane

over the region.

Really?

38:34.137 --> 38:35.138
Mm-hmm.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.445
What can I say, I guess

38:37.489 --> 38:40.709
skip chasing just
ain't my thing.

38:40.753 --> 38:41.710
Hmm.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.364
Dig that T-shirt, by the way.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.716
Yeah.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.065
Geez,

38:49.109 --> 38:50.719
Bozer, what's up? You
look like the south end

38:50.763 --> 38:51.851
of a northbound mule.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.069
Thanks, Jack.

38:53.113 --> 38:54.157
The good news is

38:54.201 --> 38:56.725
I feel the south end of...

38:56.769 --> 38:58.161
whatever you said, too.Mm, mm, mm.

38:58.205 --> 38:58.988
Hey, blondie,

38:59.032 --> 39:00.381
I've got something
for you.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.556
Really

39:01.600 --> 39:03.776
Well, this one's not from me.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.952
In light of everything
you did for Western Tech,

39:05.995 --> 39:08.084
the administration
wanted you to have this.

39:13.002 --> 39:18.094
You are no longer
a college dropout.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.057
Aw.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.493
You know what they say
about diplomas, don't you?

39:25.537 --> 39:26.799
No. You gonna tell me?

39:26.842 --> 39:28.714
Great for when you run out
of toilet paper.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.194
Are you jealous, Dalton?

39:31.238 --> 39:32.761
Girl, I don't need
a piece of paper to prove

39:32.805 --> 39:34.807
how smart I am, okay?

39:34.850 --> 39:36.678
Well, I don't need
a piece of paper to prove

39:36.722 --> 39:38.680
how smart you're not.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.597
Was that an insult

39:42.641 --> 39:43.816
No. You're a genius.

39:43.859 --> 39:44.773
Oh, thank you.

39:44.817 --> 39:45.774
All righty,

39:45.818 --> 39:48.821
who's ready to take me on?

39:50.779 --> 39:52.738
Drink up, Bozer.
