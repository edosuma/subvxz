is that the <i>Today</i> show is

about money.

<i>- Khak to saret!</i>
<i>- [Laughs]</i>

17:32.447 --> 17:35.565
Unlike every other place
I've ever worked,

17:35.567 --> 17:38.401
this business makes
no sense.

17:38.403 --> 17:40.203
And it doesn't matter
if you went

17:40.205 --> 17:41.955
to Harvard business school
or...

17:41.957 --> 17:43.339
Your college mascot
and president

17:43.341 --> 17:46.209
- was a bear in a hat?
- Exactly.

17:46.211 --> 17:48.711
This industry is
totally irrational.

17:48.713 --> 17:50.797
So if all my credentials
and degrees

17:50.799 --> 17:53.016
and experience don't matter,

17:53.018 --> 17:55.251
that means the only
qualification for this job

17:55.253 --> 17:57.720
is... loving television.

17:57.722 --> 17:59.472
What are you saying, sir?

17:59.474 --> 18:02.392
I'm saying I'm finally going
to do something for this network

18:02.394 --> 18:04.861
that I know is right.

18:04.863 --> 18:06.563
You like NBC,
don't you, Kenneth?

18:06.565 --> 18:08.565
Oh, I think it's
the most wonderful place

18:08.567 --> 18:10.033
in the whole wide world.

18:10.035 --> 18:15.054
Good. Because
I'm giving it to you.

18:15.056 --> 18:16.406
The whole thing.

18:16.408 --> 18:18.124
You're the next president

18:18.126 --> 18:22.278
of the National Broadcasting
Company.

18:22.280 --> 18:28.117
[Strained giggles]

18:43.183 --> 18:44.601
[Rock music]

18:44.603 --> 18:46.903
Welcome to <i>the Man Cave.</i>

18:46.905 --> 18:50.023
TV for your peen.

18:50.025 --> 18:51.741
R.I.P., Todd.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.964
- Why isn't he in costume?
- Ladies and gentlemen

18:57.966 --> 19:02.118
of the Kabletown board,
I quit.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.821
- So do I.
- What the hell are you doing?

19:05.823 --> 19:08.257
They're replaceable... we can get
David Alan Grier and Miss Piggy.

19:08.259 --> 19:10.093
I'll tell you
what we're doing, LL.

19:10.095 --> 19:11.994
We're finally stepping up.

19:11.996 --> 19:13.496
This show is a disaster.

19:13.498 --> 19:16.649
Except for the very moving
Todd Debeikis tribute.

19:16.651 --> 19:19.936
Todd, we'll miss you.

19:19.938 --> 19:22.305
I know you want to
save <i>TGS,</i> Lemon head,

19:22.307 --> 19:24.223
but there is no <i>TGS</i>
to save.

19:24.225 --> 19:26.225
And you should be
at the airport right now

19:26.227 --> 19:27.510
picking up your chili.

19:27.512 --> 19:28.844
Children, Tracy.

19:28.846 --> 19:31.397
Children? Why the hell
are you still here?

19:31.399 --> 19:33.232
We knew you'd never
give up, so for once,

19:33.234 --> 19:36.736
let us step up and do
what we do best... nothing.

19:36.738 --> 19:38.788
You're doing this for me?

19:38.790 --> 19:41.824
We all are.
I quit, Liz.

19:41.826 --> 19:44.860
Me too.

19:44.862 --> 19:46.746
I quit.

19:46.748 --> 19:48.331
Mommy's baby quits.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.133
I actually quit
two years ago.

19:50.135 --> 19:53.503
Subhas out.
Suck it!

19:59.259 --> 20:01.094
Get out of here, lady!

20:07.884 --> 20:09.602
I hit that.

20:14.692 --> 20:17.160
Hang on. Is that them?

20:17.162 --> 20:18.861
Is that the twins?

20:18.863 --> 20:22.498
No way!
So it <i>is</i> possible.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.001
Yeah,
I saw it on <i>Maury.</i>

20:27.371 --> 20:29.872
Is that a camera?

20:29.874 --> 20:32.709
I'm gonna need you
on my good side.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.210
What up, Liz Lemon?

20:34.212 --> 20:37.296
I will not be able
to attend school tomorrow

20:37.298 --> 20:40.016
because of an issue
with my lizard.

20:40.018 --> 20:42.585
That seems about right.
