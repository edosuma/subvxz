WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:03.422
Previously on Elementary...

00:03.470 --> 00:05.119
Uh, we're here to see
Fiona Helbron, aka "Mittens."

00:05.170 --> 00:06.467
She wrote some software
that was used

00:06.500 --> 00:08.092
to take control
of a car last night

00:08.140 --> 00:10.734
that caused a fatal accident.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.635
She wouldn't hurt anybody.
She couldn't.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.272
They say autism is a spectrum,

00:14.310 --> 00:16.801
but it's really an array
of different conditions

00:16.850 --> 00:18.442
all lumped together.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.311
I prefer the term
"neuro-atypical."

00:20.350 --> 00:22.238
What did you
want to say?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.349
Well, I confess
that I'm here to discuss

00:24.390 --> 00:25.812
the uncomfortable subject
of the murders

00:25.850 --> 00:27.283
which occurred the other day.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.685
More specifically, I'd like you

00:28.720 --> 00:31.052
to help me apprehend
the person responsible.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.559
(glass jar rattling)

00:59.760 --> 01:02.388
What does China landing
a moon rover have to do

01:02.430 --> 01:03.852
with someone trying
to kill your father?

01:03.890 --> 01:05.824
Nothing, as far
as I can tell.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.418
Or everything.

01:07.460 --> 01:08.757
At any given moment,

01:08.800 --> 01:10.392
father's fingers
were in many pies,

01:10.430 --> 01:12.261
so I'm reviewing events
both great and small

01:12.300 --> 01:13.733
which might have been
influenced by his removal.

01:13.770 --> 01:14.759
And?

01:14.800 --> 01:16.108
A few possibilities.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.734
Nothing in
high relief, as yet.

01:18.770 --> 01:19.771
(rattling continues)

01:22.310 --> 01:23.800
Okay, that's not annoying.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.272
These are the bullets

01:26.320 --> 01:27.378
that father's private surgeons

01:27.420 --> 01:28.739
removed from abdomen.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.316
Now that we're a"
sharing Information,

01:30.350 --> 01:32.887
I requested that
they send them over.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.808
His overpaid investigators
were making

01:34.860 --> 01:36.452
zero progress with them,
after all.

01:36.490 --> 01:37.787
And you have?

01:37.830 --> 01:38.854
They're of little use

01:38.890 --> 01:40.551
in tracking his shooters.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.659
Nine-millimeter,
hollow point, American-made.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.793
Obtainable almost anywhere
in the world.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.798
They do however,
help me enter the mind

01:46.840 --> 01:49.434
of whoever might have wanted
to murder my father.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.665
Not a long walk, I confess.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.272
You going somewhere?

01:57.310 --> 01:59.642
Yeah, do you remember
Fiona Helbron?

01:59.680 --> 02:01.739
I do.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.816
Well, apparently,
she's in need of a detective.

02:03.850 --> 02:07.411
She e-mailed me yesterday,
and asked me to meet up.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.484
Just you?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.555
Just me.

02:09.590 --> 02:10.579
You know, social interactions

02:10.630 --> 02:11.824
are tough for her,

02:11.860 --> 02:13.293
so I'm guessing three's a crowd.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.722
I'll circle back later.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.868
(door opens, phone rings)

02:18.900 --> 02:20.663
(door closes)

02:20.700 --> 02:21.894
Captain?

02:21.940 --> 02:23.305
GREGSON:
Ah.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.877
Sherlock Holmes,

02:27.910 --> 02:30.276
Captain Will Lombardi,
Narcotics.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.244
I've heard a lot about you.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.679
Should I be concerned?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.244
Last time you summoned
me to meet police

02:35.280 --> 02:36.884
from another precinct,
they accused me of murder.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.182
You can relax.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.881
Will's an old friend.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.854
The two_ of us were_ out
havmg dinner last night,

02:41.890 --> 02:44.427
and Will mentioned a problem
that his team is having.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.722
Something that stumped them.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.455
I told him he should
talk to you.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.297
Yeah.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.922
You ever heard
of "Satan's Brood?"

02:50.970 --> 02:52.961
Yeah, motorcycle gang.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.262
In charge of a sizeable share

02:54.300 --> 02:55.892
of the crystal meth distribution

02:55.940 --> 02:57.305
in and around the city.

02:57.340 --> 02:58.602
Yeah, these are bad guys.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.937
Armed to the teeth.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.402
They operate out
of a building in Queens

03:01.440 --> 03:03.340
that they protect
like a fortress.

03:04.550 --> 03:05.869
And how can I be of service?

03:08.880 --> 03:10.438
We want to pull
off a heist.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.185
A heist.
At their building.

03:13.820 --> 03:16.220
You want to steal something
from a heavily armed,

03:16.260 --> 03:18.319
meth-dealing band
of bike-riding Satanists?

03:18.360 --> 03:19.952
Interested?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.399
I'm practically engorged.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.398
When do we start?

03:23.430 --> 03:24.658
*

03:58.070 --> 03:59.890
LOMBARDI: Taking this place
would be a piece of cake

03:59.940 --> 04:01.032
for a small army.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.708
Mm-hmm.

04:02.740 --> 04:03.809
Well, they've
spared no expense

04:03.840 --> 04:05.967
embracing the clichs,
have they?

04:06.010 --> 04:07.602
Ubiquitous leather,

04:07.640 --> 04:09.608
the bikes modified
for maXImum norse.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.312
And you forgot the .38s
and the sawed-off shotguns.

04:12.350 --> 04:13.749
But it's not just show
with these guys.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.941
They also shuttle product
in from Southern Missouri.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.483
Now, they've had run-ins with
cops in five different states,

04:18.520 --> 04:20.988
and never once did
they go down easy.

04:21.020 --> 04:23.056
This is Will's undercover guy,

04:23.090 --> 04:26.651
Detective Ryan Dunning.

04:28.530 --> 04:29.758
Quite the chameleon.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.062
GREGSON: For 12 months,
he's been buying

04:31.100 --> 04:32.465
crystal from them,

04:32.500 --> 04:33.797
working up from grams
to half-pounds.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.592
So he's convinced them
he's a dealer.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.938
Right, all the intel
you see here came from him.

04:37.970 --> 04:40.905
And what's the target
of the heist?

04:40.940 --> 04:43.841
Dunning is in tight

04:43.880 --> 04:45.643
with the New York leader,

04:45.680 --> 04:47.477
Nicholas Farris.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.771
LOMBARDI: Yeah, he's sharp,
and he's organized.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.913
According to Dunning,
he keeps records

04:50.950 --> 04:52.952
of the whole operation
on his computer.

04:52.990 --> 04:56.881
Right, which is in an office
rear of the building,

04:56.930 --> 04:58.784
up a ramp.
Correct.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.457
If Dunning's right,
and we can get that,

05:00.500 --> 05:01.524
then we get the supply chain,

05:01.560 --> 05:02.788
foot soldiers, bank accounts,

05:02.830 --> 05:04.889
we can make convictions
up and down the ladder.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.568
So why don't you
just raid the place

05:06.600 --> 05:08.033
with this "small army"
that you mentioned?

05:08.070 --> 05:09.935
I said, "If Dunning is right."

05:09.970 --> 05:11.005
See, these guys like
their own product.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.405
They never sleep.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.532
So Dunning's never had a chance

05:13.580 --> 05:14.831
to actually check the computer.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.438
So you can't conﬁrm
its contents

05:16.480 --> 05:17.777
without storming the castle.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.641
If you storm the castle,
and it's empty,

05:19.680 --> 05:21.079
you've wasted a year's work.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.441
Catch-22.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.981
And let me be clear,
we are not trying

05:26.020 --> 05:27.578
to get the whole machine.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.485
We just need enough time
for Dunning to get in there,

05:29.530 --> 05:30.952
copy the files
onto a thumb drive

05:30.990 --> 05:32.719
and get out with his head
still attached.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.991
So you can analyze
its contents, mm-hmm.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.065
Straightforward enough.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.863
(scoffs)
Is it?

05:38.900 --> 05:40.629
My people have been working
on this for weeks.

05:40.670 --> 05:43.104
Well, then you should have come
to see me weeks ago.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.832
* To say you're trying...

05:48.880 --> 05:50.541
Fiona, hi.
You're late.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.971
Oh, three minutes. I'm sorry.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.510
Because you were late,
I started working on some code.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.744
That's okay.
Because I started,

05:56.790 --> 05:58.018
now I need to finish.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.608
I'll get some coffee.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.888
I'm finished.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.953
How have you been?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.922
I've been well, thank you.
How have you been?

06:10.970 --> 06:13.029
I have a new boss.
His name is Greg Wakino.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.731
He might be a criminal.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.701
My last boss was a criminal.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.140
I remember,
you helped us prove that.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.909
But most people
are not criminals.

06:24.950 --> 06:28.078
My last boss
used my code to hurt people,

06:28.120 --> 06:30.543
and Ijust can't
let that happen again.

06:30.590 --> 06:34.048
_ So I need to know
If Greg WakIno IS a good person.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.910
Do you want me to run
a background check on him?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.951
For money.
I have lots of it.

06:37.990 --> 06:39.958
Pentillion pays me
more than I spend,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.025
so I can give you
whatever you need.

06:42.060 --> 06:44.062
I appreciate it,
but you did me and Sherlock

06:44.100 --> 06:45.624
a favor last time.

06:45.670 --> 06:46.967
We can do you one
in return.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.636
You're right,
you can do me a favor.

06:51.670 --> 06:53.604
Well, thank you.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.108
You're welcome.

07:03.020 --> 07:06.558
You're finally making up
for that childhood you never had

07:06.590 --> 07:08.717
as a three-year-old girl

07:08.760 --> 07:10.955
Bought out
a toy shop's entire stock

07:10.990 --> 07:12.890
of "Sparkle Poodle Playhouse."

07:12.930 --> 07:14.795
The unicorns are the bikes.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.821
The train's the pool table.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.592
This one is Nick, the leader.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.799
I think it captures the gestalt

07:23.840 --> 07:25.660
of a fearsome biker gang,
don't you?

07:25.710 --> 07:27.632
I take it this is the case
you texted me about,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.672
helping Narcotics get
information off of a computer?

07:30.710 --> 07:32.974
Mm-hmm, which is...

07:33.020 --> 07:34.510
the cupcake

07:34.550 --> 07:36.689
in the inner office.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.109
Obviously.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.124
So, how is it going?

07:43.160 --> 07:46.152
Well, it's early, but I can't
foresee any real problems.

07:46.190 --> 07:49.921
I've requested an in-person
meeting with Detective Dunning,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.029
the department's
undercover operative.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.537
He's been wearing
a concealed camera

07:53.570 --> 07:54.935
for most of the year,

07:54.970 --> 07:56.062
but there are some holes
In hIs Intelligence

07:56.100 --> 07:57.135
I would like to fill.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.058
Given the _
communIcatIon restraInts

07:59.110 --> 08:01.670
of an officer posing
as a drug dealer,

08:01.710 --> 08:04.941
it's difficult to say when I'm
going to be hearing from him.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.579
How's our friend, Fiona?

08:08.620 --> 08:09.939
She's worried
about her new boss,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.014
so she wants to run
a background check

08:11.050 --> 08:12.119
before she shares code with him.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.686
I don't really blame her.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.085
Do you require assistance?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.087
No, it's routine.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.121
(phone chimes)

08:19.700 --> 08:23.522
I'm to meet Detective Dunning
on Staten Island in one hour.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.060
That's going to take some doing.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.965
Please don't
touch anything.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.833
I'll try to
restrain myself.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.111
(engine stops)

08:48.090 --> 08:52.959
I applaud your choice in
out-of-the-way meeting places.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.197
No chance of those you've
infiltrated spotting us here.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.295
You think this is a joke?

08:59.330 --> 09:02.163
You risk your neck
to bring down a violent gang,

09:02.200 --> 09:04.202
you have my utmost respect.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.698
They peddle poison to finance
their denim cosplay.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.072
They deserve all
the ridicule I can muster.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.817
Lombardi said
you needed more photos.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.110
There you go.

09:15.150 --> 09:17.641
Thanks.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.080
You want no part of me,
do you?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.883
I didn't ask for your help.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.727
I told Lombardi he should
take this crew down.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.298
You don't share his, uh,
"catch-22" opinion?

09:29.330 --> 09:31.992
_ No confidence
In the computer's contents?

09:32.030 --> 09:33.236
I know one way to ﬁnd out.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.989
Well, regardless,
these will suffice.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.361
Gonna have to.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.207
I'm not doing this again.

09:56.060 --> 09:56.958
What?

09:56.990 --> 09:58.184
I had another item

09:58.230 --> 10:00.118
on the agenda for this meeting.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.664
The real hole in the information
I was prOVIded, was you.

10:03.700 --> 10:07.067
Your physical dimensions,
your dexterity.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.133
You'll do.

10:12.210 --> 10:13.871
(engine starts)

10:41.300 --> 10:43.109
(phone ringing)

10:49.910 --> 10:52.174
You know all the furniture
Is gone, rIght?

10:52.210 --> 10:54.212
HOLMES: Join me on the roof,
would you?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.320
What are you doing?

11:08.360 --> 11:09.964
Test runs.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.160
I need to get my plan

11:11.200 --> 11:12.292
for Satan's Brood
on its feet.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.968
To try and get
a sense of how long

11:14.000 --> 11:15.194
it's gonna take
Detective Dunning

11:15.240 --> 11:16.434
to traverse
the gang's headquarters

11:16.470 --> 11:18.165
using different routes.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.099
Is that my bed?

11:21.140 --> 11:23.677
Yeah, I needed a substitute
for the gang's pool table.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.316
How did you do all this?

11:27.350 --> 11:29.318
Do you remember Luc,
my personal mover?

11:29.350 --> 11:30.749
Yeah, well,

11:30.790 --> 11:31.779
he better still be up here,

11:31.820 --> 11:33.082
because if my bed
is not back

11:33.120 --> 11:36.180
in my room
in ten minutes...

11:36.220 --> 11:37.289
(door rattles)

11:40.960 --> 11:42.188
Did you change the lock?

11:42.230 --> 11:43.788
It's the same one

11:43.830 --> 11:45.422
that's on the door
of Nick Farris' office.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.267
I'd like you to pick it.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.837
It's unreasonable _
to expect DetectIve DunnIng

11:49.870 --> 11:51.201
to be as nimble as I am,

11:51.240 --> 11:53.128
so I thought it best
to time you.

11:59.410 --> 12:00.946
You _said the common room
Is always crowded,

12:00.980 --> 12:02.277
how's he supposed
to pick a lock

12:02.320 --> 12:04.288
without a bunch
of bikers seeing him?

12:04.320 --> 12:07.084
Obviously,
a distraction will be needed.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.917
Nothing infuriates
a territorial gang

12:08.960 --> 12:10.848
_more _than other_ criminals
InfrIngIng on theIr terrItory,

12:10.890 --> 12:12.357
so staging a loud holdup

12:12.390 --> 12:14.255
of the check casher's
across the street

12:14.300 --> 12:15.858
should draw people outside.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.265
I've also_notic_ed
from DunnIng's Intel,

12:17.300 --> 12:18.369
there's a reliable dip
in attendance

12:18.400 --> 12:20.095
at the gang's headquarters

12:20.140 --> 12:22.290
that coincides with
the free Wednesday lunch buffet

12:22.340 --> 12:23.932
at the strip club
around the corner.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.359
I mean, we could wait
for the inevitable outbreak

12:26.410 --> 12:28.298
of hepatitis A,
but I think the detective

12:28.340 --> 12:30.399
might want to act
sooner than that.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.441
(phone ringing)

12:36.150 --> 12:37.378
Captain,

12:37.420 --> 12:39.809
Watson and I are just
ironing out a few kinks,

12:39.860 --> 12:40.918
but I think the plan
for the heist

12:40.960 --> 12:42.211
is going to be ready shortly.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.319
GREGSON:
Yeah, well you can stop ironing.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.554
We won't be needing it anymore.

12:45.590 --> 12:46.955
Why not?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.297
Because we no longer have

12:48.330 --> 12:50.366
an inside man to carry it out.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.139
Detective Ryan Dunning

12:53.170 --> 12:54.398
is dead.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.545
(gunshot)

13:10.420 --> 13:12.411
As far as we can tell,
Dunning went after

13:12.450 --> 13:13.917
the computer on his own.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.313
(gunshot)
This footage is from the drive

13:15.360 --> 13:18.227
on his body cam.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.989
He must've recorded it
so he could document

13:20.030 --> 13:21.918
the source of the files.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.996
HOLMES:
Is there more to the video?

13:24.030 --> 13:25.395
No.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.239
The wire must have got
pulled out of the camera.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.932
Probably when the killer
dragged the body away.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.063
The shooter didn't
Issue a warnIng,

13:32.110 --> 13:34.169
didn't ask Dunning
what he was doing in the office.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.178
Do you think the gang
realized he was a cop?

13:36.210 --> 13:37.438
If they had,
they would've done

13:37.480 --> 13:38.299
a better job getting
rid of the body.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.578
And they sure as hell

13:39.610 --> 13:41.441
would have checked him
for a wire. No.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.846
The best guess is that
they thought he was a dealer,

13:43.890 --> 13:45.346
who was trying to rip them off,

13:45.390 --> 13:47.278
caught him with his hand
in the cookie jar.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.457
Idiot.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.449
Excuse me?

13:50.490 --> 13:52.026
Dunning.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.254
I met the man.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.256
He was impatient.
A risk-taker.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.222
He wasn't suicidal.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.919
Which, given everything he
shared with us about the gang's

13:58.970 --> 14:00.392
comings and goings, would be
the only other explanation

14:00.440 --> 14:02.533
for this stupid attempt.

14:02.570 --> 14:05.164
Maybe he thought he saw
a window of opportunity.

14:05.210 --> 14:06.563
Maybe they all went to see

14:06.610 --> 14:08.430
Star Wars or something,
we don't know.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.345
Anyway, a cop is dead.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.472
The gloves are off.

14:11.510 --> 14:13.876
ESU hit the hangout before dawn.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.617
Netted 20 kilos of meth
and 14 gang members.

14:17.650 --> 14:21.518
That's all of the regulars,
except...

14:21.560 --> 14:22.413
the leader.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.950
Name is Nick Farris.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.981
We put a Finest Message
out on him.

14:27.530 --> 14:29.191
Do we know

14:29.230 --> 14:31.061
which of the gang members
is the shooter?

14:31.100 --> 14:33.295
No. No one's talking.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.637
They won't have to.

14:34.670 --> 14:37.400
There might be another way
to identify the gunman.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.636
His sleeve rides up here.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.646
There's a mole
on hIs rIght erst,

14:45.680 --> 14:47.910
shaped like...

14:47.950 --> 14:50.145
Iceland.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.159
I'll ask someone to check
the bikers we have in custody.

14:53.190 --> 14:56.387
I take it CSU
is still processing the scene?

14:56.420 --> 14:58.183
I'd like to see it.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.475
It's almost like dj vu,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.442
entering a space
you've studied so intently,

15:22.480 --> 15:25.449
but never set foot in.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.315
Although,
Detective Dunning's research

15:28.360 --> 15:31.420
failed to include
the onslaught of smells.

15:31.460 --> 15:34.156
Smoke of several types,
body odor,

15:34.200 --> 15:37.419
alcohol,
pre- and post-consumption.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.199
That was the captain.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.266
All the bikers in custody
have been checked out.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.631
There's plenty
of scars and tattoos,

15:42.670 --> 15:44.729
but no one's sporting
a map of Iceland.

15:44.770 --> 15:48.137
So Nick Farris is probably
the one who shot Dunning.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.648
I'm gonna try
to find his office.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.375
No need, it's this way.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.433
The rug is gone.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.200
Dunning landed on
a rug when he was shot.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.606
Hey, you guys already bag
a rug that was here?

16:22.640 --> 16:25.245
The floor was clear
when we got here.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.599
Likely the killer removed it

16:26.650 --> 16:29.210
to eliminate blood
and gunshot reSIdue.

16:29.250 --> 16:32.242
I'll have Unis check all
the Dumpsters in the area.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.554
I think I might know where
to find the missing Nick Farris.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.387
This is a broken

16:36.420 --> 16:38.149
kick-start lever to
an antIque BrItIsh motorcycle,

16:38.190 --> 16:39.657
Triumph 650.

16:39.690 --> 16:40.725
Well, on our way in,
I saw them

16:40.760 --> 16:42.398
loading the bikes for impound.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.398
Looked to me like
they were all Harleys.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.068
15 of them.
One for each member of the gang,

16:46.100 --> 16:48.261
including Nick Farris'.
I recognized his

16:48.300 --> 16:49.562
from a photograph
that Dunning took of it.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.603
So Nick Farris isn't here,
but his bike is?

16:52.640 --> 16:53.777
Maybe he heard
about the raid,

16:53.810 --> 16:55.471
got a different ride
out of town.

16:55.510 --> 16:58.308
Or, if we're luclq,
he still intends to.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.238
Tetrachloroethylene.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.181
It's _an oil used to remove
partIcularly stubborn bolts.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.585
Judging by the fumes,

17:04.620 --> 17:06.645
this was removed
in the last 48 hours.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.783
So whatever bike that's from,
it still might be in the shop.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.321
Only a handful
of mechanics

17:10.360 --> 17:11.679
in the city service

17:11.730 --> 17:13.595
antique British motorcycles.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.552
Bike shops keep
notoriously lazy hours.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.397
If we post police
at each of them,

17:17.430 --> 17:19.591
we might get luclq
and catch Mr. Farris

17:19.630 --> 17:21.632
as he picks up
his second ride.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.228
I'll let the captain know.

17:23.270 --> 17:25.431
(phone chimes)

17:27.310 --> 17:29.528
Hey, are you okay
without me for a while?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.400
Uh, I'm supposed to meet
with Fiona again.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.668
I'll let you know
if the missing biker turns up.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.617
WATSON:
This was published

17:40.660 --> 17:42.252
in a trade magazine
a few years ago.

17:42.290 --> 17:43.518
It reads like a puff piece,

17:43.560 --> 17:45.084
but if you look at my research,

17:45.130 --> 17:47.428
you'll see
that it is all true.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.553
Greg Wakino is,
by all accounts,

17:49.600 --> 17:50.692
a great guy.

17:50.730 --> 17:53.267
Smart, patient,
a great leader.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.861
He's also on the board
of two charities.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.107
Phi_| was involved
In charItIes.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.698
People called him
a great guy.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.605
Well, he and Greg
are very different people.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.777
And for what it's worth,

18:03.810 --> 18:05.744
I get a really good feeling
from him.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.668
That helps.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.711
All of this helps.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.217
Thank you.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.715
Say, "You're welcome."

18:16.620 --> 18:18.156
You're welcome.

18:18.190 --> 18:20.795
I'd like you
to take something.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.619
Old Possum's Book
of Practical Cats.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.695
By Thomas Stearns Eliot.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.662
He was also called "T.S."

18:29.700 --> 18:32.134
1939.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.330
This is a first edition.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.529
Fiona, I can't take this.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.672
This is too generous.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.575
I wasn't clear, I'm sorry.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.168
I'd like you
to take it to Sherlock.

18:39.210 --> 18:40.814
It's his.
He loaned it to me.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.710
He did?

18:43.750 --> 18:44.887
The day the police
arrested Phil.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.740
He knew I liked cats,

18:46.790 --> 18:49.350
so he thought I might like poems
about them, too.

18:49.390 --> 18:50.823
I didn't.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.680
You don't have to tell him that.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.790
I won't.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.890
You got the wrong guy.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.794
You are Nick Farris, right?

19:02.840 --> 19:04.501
That was your Triumph 650

19:04.540 --> 19:05.859
you were trying to pick up
at that garage?

19:05.910 --> 19:07.639
I mean, I didn't do this.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.272
GREGSON: Do us a favor,
show us your wrist.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.641
Come again?

19:10.680 --> 19:13.376
Your right wrist--
we want to take a look.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.417
No mole.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.189
What are you talking about?

19:22.220 --> 19:24.882
We took down 14 of your buddies
last night at your clubhouse.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.422
What I want to know is,
who did we miss?

19:28.460 --> 19:30.826
Sounds like nobody.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.189
Any bikers

19:32.230 --> 19:33.788
from another chapter,

19:33.840 --> 19:36.593
out-of-state guests,
female entertainment?

19:36.640 --> 19:40.508
I already told you,
I wasn't there,

19:40.540 --> 19:42.679
but my guys know the rules,

19:42.710 --> 19:44.644
no guests.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.443
Uh, you think
one of them did it,

19:46.480 --> 19:47.674
only we already know,

19:47.720 --> 19:49.472
none of them is a match
for our shooter.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.782
Then I don't know
what to tell you.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.981
You get that CCS has
your computer now, right?

19:53.020 --> 19:54.749
They're like
the department's I.T. squad.

19:54.790 --> 19:56.712
They're going to dig
through every nook and cranny.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.921
Between that and all
the video Dunning got of you,

19:58.960 --> 20:00.825
you're looking at 15 to 25.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.828
GREGSON:
Help us find

20:02.860 --> 20:04.794
the person who did this,
maybe the DA.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.263
offers you a deal.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.991
Is something funny?

20:10.040 --> 20:13.305
I was just thinking,

20:13.340 --> 20:15.535
this is the first time
In my lIfe,

20:15.580 --> 20:18.299
me and the cops want
the same thing.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.318
I don't know who did this,

20:20.350 --> 20:22.841
but whoever he is,

20:22.880 --> 20:25.417
he brought you guys
down on my head, so...

20:25.450 --> 20:28.817
I hope you find him.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.420
And I hope you put him
in my cell.

20:33.860 --> 20:36.590
He and I have a lot
to talk about.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.669
Hmm, that can not be good
for your eyes.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.860
Mine eyes offend me.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.436
They're missing something.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.903
It's an unsettling sensation.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.908
(sighs)

20:47.940 --> 20:49.908
So, I got Marcus' text.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.908
Farris isn't our shooter.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.918
Obviously, one of the gang
let someone in last night.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.269
They swear that they did not.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.673
I believe them.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.982
What, you think
someone broke in?

20:58.020 --> 20:59.840
Leaving aside the fact that
the Brood's lair

20:59.890 --> 21:02.518
is nigh impenetrable,
let's say they had.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.050
What would be their agenda,
to steal from the gang?

21:04.090 --> 21:06.058
As far as anyone can tell,
nothing was taken.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.627
Maybe the shooting didn't have
anything to do with the gang.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.821
Maybe Dunning had an enemy,
they followed him in...

21:10.870 --> 21:12.064
And shot him twice
in a building occupied

21:12.100 --> 21:13.465
by 15 heavily armed bikers?

21:14.670 --> 21:15.796
I have to believe there were

21:15.840 --> 21:17.967
easier times and places
to do the man in.

21:19.010 --> 21:19.965
Has the rug turned up?

21:20.010 --> 21:20.977
It has not.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.500
The bikers in lockup swear

21:22.540 --> 21:23.939
that they got rid of it
a week ago

21:23.980 --> 21:25.709
when one of their hard-partying
crew named "Chainsaw,"

21:25.750 --> 21:27.672
soiled it in
a most unpleasant way.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.449
Obviously,
that is a lie, right?

21:29.480 --> 21:31.880
Or Farris
replaced the rug.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.926
Aren't you gonna ask me
how it went with Fiona?

21:42.760 --> 21:43.966
How did it go with Fiona?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.092
It went well.

21:45.130 --> 21:47.462
Her boss seems like a nice guy.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.865
She's decided
to stay at Pentillion.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.333
(inhales)

21:52.870 --> 21:55.100
You know, you could have
told me that you like her.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.698
I beg your pardon?

21:56.740 --> 21:58.002
You like her.

21:59.410 --> 22:01.742
Yes, I like Fiona.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.509
She's compulsively honest,

22:03.550 --> 22:04.881
and she's congenitally
unpretentious.

22:04.920 --> 22:05.909
And pretty.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.649
You like her as in like like.

22:10.690 --> 22:11.952
You're suggesting
a romantic interest,

22:11.990 --> 22:13.548
and more specifically,
you're suggesting

22:13.600 --> 22:14.794
a_ romantic interest
In the vernacular

22:14.830 --> 22:15.922
of a prepubescent child.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.761
This is the book you loaned her.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.688
She wanted me to give
it back to you.

22:26.770 --> 22:27.930
So?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.642
So?

22:30.680 --> 22:33.649
Hundreds of books in the house,
how many volumes of poetry?

22:33.680 --> 22:34.942
Zero.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.140
You bought if for her.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.989
Bought it to lend it.

22:38.020 --> 22:38.987
Right.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.578
Do you mind?

22:41.620 --> 22:42.917
No, I don't mind at all.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.855
Oh, come on.

22:49.830 --> 22:50.797
Why are you being

22:50.830 --> 22:51.967
so weird about this?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.160
I'm being weird.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.690
Yes, you are.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.889
You like someone,
that's amazing.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.430
I like many women,

22:57.470 --> 22:58.835
often two at at time,
you know that.

22:58.870 --> 23:00.974
No, this is not about sex.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.477
You really like her.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.978
Stop using that word.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.898
I'm sorry,
and I'm sorry that I teased you,

23:06.950 --> 23:07.917
but I really do think
this is great.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.019
I want to help.

23:09.050 --> 23:10.517
Help?

23:10.550 --> 23:12.518
I could talk to her,
feel her out.

23:12.550 --> 23:13.881
See if the feeling is mutual.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.080
Look, the book thing
didn't work out,

23:15.120 --> 23:17.008
but maybe we could find
something that does.

23:23.130 --> 23:25.564
It's Detective Dunning's
autopsy report.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.965
"Cause of death,
multiple gunshots."

23:30.000 --> 23:31.638
Surprise, surprise.

23:33.640 --> 23:34.971
What?

23:35.010 --> 23:37.740
We need to go to
the morgue right away.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.582
Do you want to tell me
what we're looking for?

23:43.620 --> 23:45.542
Iceland.

23:45.590 --> 23:46.943
Under "distinguishing marks,"

23:46.990 --> 23:50.881
the medical examiner
|Isted a small mole.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.921
It's location...

23:52.960 --> 23:54.996
Detective Dunning's right wrist.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.592
This doesn't make any sense.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.791
It does, if you let it.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.138
The man we saw
shoot Ryan Dunning,

24:03.170 --> 24:05.866
was Ryan Dunning.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.975
WATSON: Dunning and
an accomplice staged the video.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.715
Dunning played the part
of the shooter,

24:17.750 --> 24:19.638
while his partner
wore the camera.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.988
Why?
HOLMES:
Well, we don't know yet.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.681
Presumably, he intended
to survive the ruse

24:23.730 --> 24:25.152
and merely fake his own death.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.897
Maybe he was gonna leave us
a body we couldn't identify

24:27.930 --> 24:30.023
or maybe the camera
was just gonna turn up.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.766
Given his current residency
at the morgue,

24:31.800 --> 24:32.960
it seems likely
that his co-conspirator

24:33.000 --> 24:34.558
double-crossed him.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.761
The real_ bullet wounds
were p05ItIoned to match

24:36.800 --> 24:39.906
what we believe we saw.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.033
At the very least,
this suggests an awareness

24:42.080 --> 24:44.548
on the killer's part
that a video was being made.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.070
All this over a mole.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.111
Hell, it could be
a piece of dirt.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.583
It isn't just the mole.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.713
Once we realized _
whose hand we were lookIng at,

24:52.750 --> 24:54.149
we re-examined the video.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.181
The shooter's legs
and lower body

24:56.220 --> 24:57.619
are also a match for Dunning.

24:57.660 --> 24:59.025
HOLMES:
Conversely,

24:59.060 --> 25:00.755
we found that the person
wearing the camera

25:00.800 --> 25:02.529
could not be Dunning.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.266
The detective stood
at six-foot-two.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.767
When I met him,

25:05.800 --> 25:06.789
I measured his stride length

25:06.830 --> 25:08.866
to be 34 inches.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.834
Upon questioning
those details in the video,

25:10.870 --> 25:13.134
I estimate the camera's wearer
to be about five-foot-seven,

25:13.170 --> 25:15.138
with a step length of 30 inches,

25:15.180 --> 25:17.102
also a slight favor
of the left leg.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.846
GREGSON:
I know.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.541
It's a lot to take in, Will.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.047
A lot to take in?

25:23.020 --> 25:26.217
It's unbelievable.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.881
Why?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.012
Why would he stage the video?

25:30.060 --> 25:31.687
What did he stand to gain?

25:31.730 --> 25:32.879
You told me that Dunning
had been pushing

25:32.930 --> 25:34.158
for months to take
down that crew?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.055
Staging his own murder
in Farris' office

25:37.100 --> 25:38.658
made that happen.
HOLMES:
As for motive,

25:38.700 --> 25:40.998
at this point,
we can only theorize.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.996
Detective Dunning managed
to shoot this video

25:43.040 --> 25:45.258
inside a veritable fortress.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.959
Given those circumstances,

25:47.010 --> 25:48.034
it seems likely he was in league

25:48.080 --> 25:49.809
with one or more members
of the gang.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.070
It's possible it was
a well-concealed mutiny.

25:52.110 --> 25:53.748
Farris takes a big fall,

25:53.780 --> 25:56.169
while his underlings
get slaps on the wrist.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.881
They get out
long before he does,

25:57.920 --> 25:59.740
and Dunning's partner
rises to the top.

25:59.790 --> 26:02.987
There's another possibility,
too.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.079
Dunning's last assignment
had him buying product

26:05.130 --> 26:06.654
from the Mexicans.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.226
Now they've stepped right
into the vacuum

26:08.260 --> 26:09.727
and taken over Farris' corners.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.125
Maybe,

26:11.170 --> 26:13.365
Dunning got chummy
with one of them.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.129
Maybe they coerced him
into doing this,

26:15.170 --> 26:17.229
I-I don't know,

26:17.270 --> 26:19.932
but I'll look into it,

26:19.970 --> 26:23.679
and whatever the truth is,
we'll deal with it.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.089
Who are you calling?

26:32.120 --> 26:34.008
CCS.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.254
Back when _
DetectIve DunnIng

26:35.290 --> 26:37.281
was urging his captain
to raid the gang,

26:37.320 --> 26:39.185
he insisted
that Farris' computer

26:39.230 --> 26:41.095
held a wealth
of evidence against them.

26:41.130 --> 26:42.119
Now, that might
have been a lie

26:42.160 --> 26:44.094
to bait the captain
into action

26:44.130 --> 26:45.666
or he might have been
telling the truth.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.928
If it is true,

26:46.970 --> 26:48.198
that computer has
all the details

26:48.240 --> 26:50.663
of the gang's
activities and finances.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.702
A good place to look for other
motives to break them up.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.276
If you're asking if Dunning
was telling the truth

26:55.310 --> 26:57.301
about the computer, he was.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.001
It took some time
to break the encryptIon,

26:59.050 --> 27:00.244
so I haven't been through
the whole machine yet,

27:00.280 --> 27:02.168
but there's already plenty here,

27:02.220 --> 27:03.881
and not just against Farris.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.114
I'd say his suppliers
in the Midwest

27:05.150 --> 27:07.141
have plenty to worry about, too.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.385
What about money? Dunning
mentioned banking records.

27:09.420 --> 27:13.186
Yes, Farris had accounts
in Switzerland,

27:13.230 --> 27:14.197
and the Cayman Islands.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.198
Would you be able to tell

27:16.230 --> 27:17.424
if there was any activity
on these accounts

27:17.460 --> 27:19.121
in the last 24 hours?

27:19.170 --> 27:20.364
I checked.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.698
Someone cleaned them out
late yesterday mornIng.

27:22.740 --> 27:26.403
All together, about
five-and-a-half million dollars.

27:26.440 --> 27:30.228
The transfers were
at around 11:30.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.372
That was after the raid,

27:31.410 --> 27:33.401
and before police
picked up Farris,

27:33.450 --> 27:35.418
so it's possible he realized
we had his computer,

27:35.450 --> 27:37.179
and moved the money
while he still could.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.414
Or Dunning's accomplice

27:38.450 --> 27:40.281
used the distraction
of a po|Ice raId

27:40.320 --> 27:42.083
to help himself
to Farris' money.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.348
(phone rings)

27:43.390 --> 27:46.325
Excuse me a minute--
thIs IS my captaIn.

27:50.230 --> 27:51.299
You were right.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.195
About?
About Fiona.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.130
I am drawn to her.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.331
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

27:57.370 --> 27:58.405
It is a bad thing.
Why?

27:58.440 --> 27:59.429
Well, let's say

27:59.470 --> 28:01.006
I acted on my feelings.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.371
and I, uh, engaged her.

28:02.410 --> 28:04.071
Forged a relationship.

28:04.110 --> 28:05.338
Do you think
that would end well for her?

28:05.380 --> 28:07.143
Why are you assuming
it would end?

28:07.180 --> 28:08.738
Oh, so she's my destiny now,
is she?

28:08.780 --> 28:10.247
We're going to get married
and have children.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.384
I'm just saying, you're worrying
about the breakup

28:12.420 --> 28:14.183
when you haven't even
gone out on a date.

28:14.220 --> 28:15.983
There's not going
to be a date.
Why not?

28:16.020 --> 28:17.749
Because she's more sensitive
than the average woman.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.326
She's easier
to hurt and confuse.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.225
So, don't hurt her.
Don't confuse her.

28:21.260 --> 28:22.227
I confuse everyone.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.069
So, by not asking Fiona out,

28:24.100 --> 28:25.397
you are protecting her from you.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.933
That is ridiculous.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.938
You make it sound like you
can't be in a relationship,

28:29.970 --> 28:31.232
when you were, with Irene.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.237
Oh, you mean Moriarty?

28:32.270 --> 28:33.999
Whatever you want
to call her,

28:34.040 --> 28:35.109
you loved her.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.107
She broke your heart,
I get it,

28:36.140 --> 28:37.209
but just because she did,

28:37.240 --> 28:39.276
doesn't mean
that Fiona will, too.

28:40.350 --> 28:41.749
(footsteps approaching)

28:41.780 --> 28:42.849
TECH:
Sorry...

28:42.880 --> 28:44.313
I have to go prep a deposition,

28:44.350 --> 28:46.784
but you can keep all of this.

28:46.820 --> 28:49.380
I'll let you know
ifI find anything else.

28:49.420 --> 28:50.978
Okay, thanks.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.253
She has a nice butt, okay.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.995
You don't have to stare at it.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.330
Detective Hagen?

29:07.510 --> 29:09.831
Sorry, our captain would
like a quick word.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.949
It shouldn't take a moment.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.868
Okay.

29:12.910 --> 29:15.071
Thanks.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.217
Captain's not even here.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.251
How tall would you say
the detective was?

29:23.290 --> 29:26.157
I don't know, five-seven?

29:26.190 --> 29:28.294
Mm-hmm.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.059
See how she favors
her left leg?

29:30.100 --> 29:32.364
She has a step length
of approximately 30 inches,

29:32.400 --> 29:34.391
or wouldn't you agree?

29:36.470 --> 29:39.860
We've seen that gait before.

29:47.880 --> 29:51.338
Detective Hagen was
Ryan Dunning's accomplice.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.187
She plays the part

29:53.220 --> 29:54.414
of Dunning in that video.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.449
Why?

29:55.490 --> 29:58.050
She has hips and breasts.

29:58.090 --> 30:01.150
Putting her behind the camera
protects her identity.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.896
Not to_ mention the fact that
In thIs conspIracy of two,

30:03.930 --> 30:06.398
only Dunning could pass
for a member of the Brood.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.364
This was about the computer.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.992
This was always
about the computer.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.531
Gaining access to it long enough
to decrypt its contents

30:12.570 --> 30:14.936
and empty Nick Farris'
bank accounts.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.403
Dunning spent months trying
to convince his captain

30:17.440 --> 30:20.546
to execute a raid
on the gang's headquarters.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.411
What would said raid
have accomplished?

30:22.450 --> 30:24.338
It would put the computer
in Lisa Hagen's hands.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.846
Precisely.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.585
Only Captain Lombardi
refuses to act,

30:27.620 --> 30:30.589
so the two detectives
concoct Plan B.

30:30.620 --> 30:34.124
Fake Dunning's murder
to force the raid.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.252
Same result.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.393
Computer goes to Hagen.

30:37.430 --> 30:40.194
Only this time,
she gets an added bonus,

30:40.230 --> 30:42.391
doubling the value of her prize.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.601
She kills Dunning,
keeps all the money for herself.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.505
You're right.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.974
Everything you're saying
fits perfectly.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.204
Thank you.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.879
Except for one thing,

30:52.910 --> 30:54.377
none of it makes any sense.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.412
Dunning shows up
at a heavily guarded building

30:57.450 --> 30:59.941
with a second cop, a female cop,

30:59.990 --> 31:01.878
which you would think
would stand out a little.

31:01.920 --> 31:02.989
Somehow he sneaks

31:03.020 --> 31:04.624
past a gauntlet of bikers

31:04.660 --> 31:06.457
into the office,

31:06.490 --> 31:08.890
where they stay long enough
to shoot a video,

31:08.930 --> 31:11.398
with gunshots,
and then get out alive.

31:11.430 --> 31:12.988
Have you forgotten about
the hours you spent trying

31:13.030 --> 31:16.238
to figure out how to get Dunning
in there alone,

31:16.270 --> 31:19.330
just to give him enough time
to copy files to a stick drive?

31:20.370 --> 31:23.373
Oh, um, can you remind me,

31:23.410 --> 31:25.549
which one of these is Dunning,
and which one is Hagen?

31:25.580 --> 31:27.309
Oh, right,
it doesn't matter,

31:27.350 --> 31:30.945
because they would both be dead.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.158
According to Captain Lombardi,

31:35.190 --> 31:36.452
Lisa Hagen and Ryan Dunning
worked together

31:36.490 --> 31:38.253
on a previous assignment.

31:38.290 --> 31:39.484
Perhaps they grew close.

31:39.530 --> 31:41.088
Perhaps they grew very close.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.394
Given the encryption
on Farris' computer,

31:43.430 --> 31:45.990
Dunning would have known he'd
need an expert to mine its data.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.258
Which brings us back
to my question,

31:47.300 --> 31:48.460
which you still
haven't answered.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.536
If Dunning could get
a computer expert in,

31:50.570 --> 31:52.401
and with all that time,

31:52.440 --> 31:54.169
why would he need
to get the computer out,

31:54.210 --> 31:55.575
Why not just copy the files?

31:55.610 --> 31:57.237
Perhaps Farris'
safeguards prevented one

31:57.280 --> 31:59.407
from simply copying the files.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.509
If so, getting the computer
out of the ofﬁce

32:01.550 --> 32:03.438
and into the police lab would
still have been necessary.

32:05.420 --> 32:08.457
Okay, even if you're right,
which, I'm still not saying,

32:08.490 --> 32:09.718
how are we going to prove it?

32:09.760 --> 32:11.489
The bank transfers
are untraceable,

32:11.530 --> 32:12.588
and Lisa's
had carte blanche

32:12.630 --> 32:14.188
to that computer
for at least two days.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.492
I mean, she would
have been smart enough

32:15.530 --> 32:17.122
to get rid
of any digital track

32:17.160 --> 32:18.991
she might have left.

32:20.030 --> 32:21.361
Okay, now,

32:21.400 --> 32:22.492
you might not need sleep,
but I do,

32:22.540 --> 32:25.634
so please, get out of my room.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.514
(doorbell buzzes)

32:38.790 --> 32:41.486
I know it's late,
but I wanted to give Joan

32:41.520 --> 32:43.112
a present for helping me.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.457
Oh, come in.

32:50.430 --> 32:53.297
Food is for new houses
or babIes,

32:53.330 --> 32:56.390
but this is pie,
which is for dessert.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.466
_Wine is _
for dInner partIes.

32:59.510 --> 33:00.568
Flowers can be
lots of thIngs,

33:00.610 --> 33:02.009
I guess,
depending on the color.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.439
These are yellow,
multi-purpose,

33:03.480 --> 33:05.107
but not romantic.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.469
She can pick
the gift she wants,

33:06.510 --> 33:10.344
or have them all.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.314
Is she here?

33:12.350 --> 33:13.612
Uh, yes, she's just
turning in for the night,

33:13.650 --> 33:14.719
but if you
give me a moment...

33:14.760 --> 33:16.057
No, that's okay.

33:16.090 --> 33:17.182
I don't want
to bother her.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.551
And besides,

33:18.590 --> 33:20.649
I also wanted to see you.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.698
The day Phil was arrested,
you walked me home.

33:24.730 --> 33:27.426
We talked...
and I liked it...

33:28.670 --> 33:31.104
...talking to you.

33:31.140 --> 33:32.505
Can we do it again?

33:34.540 --> 33:36.701
It's pretty up here.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.800
My apartment has
a nice view,

33:39.850 --> 33:41.545
but nothing like this.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.275
Watson tells me you're
about to start working

33:43.320 --> 33:45.515
with Phil Balsam's
replacement.

33:45.550 --> 33:47.541
Uh, next week.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.581
His name is Greg Wakino.

33:52.290 --> 33:53.757
I, uh, I wrote him
an e-mail today.

33:53.790 --> 33:57.294
I explained
that I'm neuro-atypical.

33:57.330 --> 33:58.592
Told him

33:58.630 --> 34:00.598
what it's like
to work with me,

34:00.630 --> 34:03.565
whatI need from him,
and what he can expect.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.637
That way when we meet,
it'll be easier.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.571
I'm sure
he appreCIated that.

34:09.610 --> 34:12.306
It's hard for me, talking,

34:12.350 --> 34:15.513
not picking up on the things
that other people do.

34:15.550 --> 34:18.189
The uh, the signals...

34:21.220 --> 34:22.653
...|ike now.

34:24.590 --> 34:28.321
I can't tell if you're,
if you're happy to see me, or...

34:28.360 --> 34:30.419
I'm very happy to see you.

34:33.370 --> 34:34.792
Would you like to kiss me?

34:39.640 --> 34:42.632
Asking 'cause I'd like you to.

34:44.380 --> 34:45.847
Um, Fiona...

34:45.880 --> 34:47.507
I've been, uh,
thinking about you.

34:47.550 --> 34:50.474
Spending time with you that day,

34:52.350 --> 34:55.251
That doesn't happen very often.

34:55.290 --> 34:57.656
Also, you're very handsome,

34:57.690 --> 34:59.624
and you smell nice.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.821
A lot of people don't.

35:03.630 --> 35:04.562
(phone chimes)

35:08.500 --> 35:09.728
Was that your phone?

35:09.770 --> 35:11.806
Uh, yes it was.

35:13.810 --> 35:16.176
Strange that you're
not checking it, isn't it?

35:18.910 --> 35:21.640
It's a colleague,
he wants me to call him.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.647
I'll go now.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.183
I should.

35:25.220 --> 35:26.619
This was hard, coming here,

35:26.650 --> 35:28.413
saying these things.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.657
I'm glad I did,
but I'd like to stop now.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.742
Sherlock!

35:58.990 --> 36:00.218
What the hell is all this?

36:00.250 --> 36:01.683
You're confused.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.312
You're wondering
how I managed to move you

36:03.360 --> 36:04.827
and your bed to the media room
without waking you.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.624
A little.
I didn't move you.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.196
Wh-- are you saying
someone else did?

36:09.230 --> 36:11.562
After you turned in last night,
Marcus informed me

36:11.600 --> 36:13.761
that the missing rug
had been found.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.461
The one from the video?

36:15.500 --> 36:17.468
The police traced it
from the gang's Dumpster

36:17.500 --> 36:19.707
to a landfill.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.708
It had been soiled
in precisely the way

36:21.740 --> 36:23.628
the bikers said it would be.

36:26.510 --> 36:27.408
So?

36:27.450 --> 36:29.645
So, it was not soiled

36:29.680 --> 36:31.489
in the staged video.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.611
What does this have to do
with you

36:37.660 --> 36:38.786
moving my bed in here?

36:38.830 --> 36:40.388
As I said, I didn't move you.

36:40.430 --> 36:41.556
Look out the window,
you'll see you're still

36:41.600 --> 36:42.794
squarely on the second floor.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.976
This is my bedroom.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.705
So, you moved all
this stuff down here

36:58.750 --> 37:00.809
to make me think
I was in the media room.

37:00.850 --> 37:01.874
Now you know why the two rugs

37:01.920 --> 37:03.672
don't look the same.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.982
One of them
is the genuine article...

37:10.390 --> 37:12.381
So Dunning and Hagen
built an exact replica

37:12.430 --> 37:13.988
of this office someplace else.

37:14.030 --> 37:15.691
That's where they
shot the video.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.857
I'd very much like to find it,
wouldn't you?

37:25.940 --> 37:27.669
You don't have to carry that.

37:27.710 --> 37:29.029
I'm a big detective.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.399
Oh, no, it's my pleasure.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.668
So glad we ran
into each other,

37:31.710 --> 37:32.904
it gives me a chance
to tell you

37:32.950 --> 37:34.713
how useful_
our preVIous meetIng was.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.377
Oh, glad to hear it.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.741
I think that's everything
off Farris' computer now,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.917
so I can give you
a more thorough report.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.281
How was your deposition?

37:42.320 --> 37:44.379
Uh, rescheduled for next week.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.920
I just have to ask,

37:45.960 --> 37:47.723
the bits and pieces
we get from the sidelines,

37:47.760 --> 37:48.749
it's like trying to put
a jigsaw puzzle together

37:48.800 --> 37:50.620
with half the set.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.264
Good practice, by the way,
if you haven't tried it.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.392
Um, I-I heard Dunning
faked his own murder

37:56.440 --> 37:57.759
to get to the bank accounts,

37:57.800 --> 38:00.303
but then his accomplice
really killed him?

38:00.340 --> 38:01.568
That's our understanding.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.498
We should know
more soon, yeah.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.372
Oh, we're in here today.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.857
Would you mind?

38:19.390 --> 38:21.790
Detective, have a seat.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.798
(clears throat)

38:23.830 --> 38:25.525
Detective Hagen.

38:25.570 --> 38:29.734
This is Detective Riba,
your union delegate.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.658
We know you did it, Lisa.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.029
HOLMES:
I confess,

38:33.070 --> 38:34.901
we were stumped
for quite some time,

38:34.940 --> 38:36.908
trying to work out how you
and Detective Dunning

38:36.940 --> 38:37.736
shot that video.

38:37.780 --> 38:38.974
_ Then we realized_
It was more a questIon

38:39.010 --> 38:40.546
of where you shot it.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.343
Once we understood
that you had created

38:42.380 --> 38:44.348
a facsimile
of Nick Farris' office,

38:44.390 --> 38:46.483
it was just a matter
of locating it.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.010
WATSON:
Your grandparents were in

38:48.050 --> 38:49.779
the antiques business
up in Tarrytown.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.027
We saw that your family
still owns a warehouse up there.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.687
We searched it this morning,

38:53.730 --> 38:55.550
and found what's left
of your set.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.056
HOLMES:
You dressed it perfectly.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.694
Meticulously matching
every detail.

38:59.730 --> 39:00.958
Paneled walls,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.865
desk, girlie calendar...

39:03.700 --> 39:05.361
the rug.

39:06.810 --> 39:08.061
At some point
after you were done,

39:08.110 --> 39:09.805
you shot Dunning
in the back for real.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.671
You were careful to use
the same angles

39:11.710 --> 39:13.803
as you did in the video,
so they would match,

39:13.850 --> 39:16.045
including the final shot
to the head.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.479
HOLMES:
You did your best

39:17.520 --> 39:18.782
to scrub everything down.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.947
Burned what you
couldn't wash away.

39:20.990 --> 39:23.083
But that's the difference
between a fake crime scene

39:23.120 --> 39:24.587
and a real one.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.825
Evidence always
sticks around.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.088
We didn't have to invite

39:28.130 --> 39:30.792
your union delegate
for this conversation.

39:30.830 --> 39:32.593
We could have ambushed you,

39:32.630 --> 39:34.791
like you ambushed
Detective Dunning.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.831
But in the end,

39:36.870 --> 39:39.532
we decided
to treat you WIth respect,

39:39.570 --> 39:41.003
like a cop.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.803
HOLMES: Really, the only
things we don't know,

39:42.840 --> 39:46.947
and-and this might offer you
some small saving grace,

39:46.980 --> 39:48.845
is_ who's _idea it was
In the ﬁrst place,

39:48.880 --> 39:50.518
and when the plan changed,

39:50.550 --> 39:52.689
leading to
Detective Dunning's death.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.982
WATSON: Maybe he got
violent with you,

39:54.020 --> 39:55.180
and maybe you realized
he was gonna

39:55.220 --> 39:56.949
double-cross you,
so you killed him first.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.719
If there's anything
you want to tell us

39:58.760 --> 40:02.389
to make this go easier,
now's your chance.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.998
(doorbell rings)

40:11.910 --> 40:15.573
I was hoping we might resume our
conversation from last night.

40:16.840 --> 40:17.977
Come in.

40:31.730 --> 40:32.958
* Hey, hey, take me,
I'm yours... *

40:32.990 --> 40:34.696
I've had boyfriends before.

40:34.730 --> 40:37.995
I, myself, have not.

40:38.030 --> 40:40.567
Perhaps I just haven't met
the right guy.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.136
I thought maybe you
were wondering...

40:42.170 --> 40:43.990
if...

40:44.040 --> 40:46.668
_ I don't know-- _
sometImes people are summed.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.530
You're a remarkable woman.

40:48.580 --> 40:53.176
I assumed I was not
the first person to notice that.

40:53.210 --> 40:56.668
I'm different, too,
from other women you've dated,

40:56.720 --> 40:59.780
or other women you could date.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.880
It takes a little
more work with me.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.558
A little more time.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.228
I know that
because I've heard it

41:06.260 --> 41:09.024
from both
my previous boyfriends.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.755
They were NT, neuro-typical.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.166
Personally, I abhor the typical.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.532
* Hey, hey, baby...

41:15.570 --> 41:18.562
Does the offer
to kiss you still stand?

41:19.810 --> 41:20.959
No.

41:22.010 --> 41:23.637
I mean it does,

41:23.680 --> 41:25.272
just not right now.

41:25.310 --> 41:28.143
* Oh, let me in...

41:28.180 --> 41:29.875
I'm a little afraid.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.046
* Hey, hey, baby...

41:31.080 --> 41:33.640
I'm a little afraid, too.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.955
Would you like to get
some coffee with me?

41:36.990 --> 41:39.151
I'd be delighted.
