02:35.021 --> 02:36.623
You ran again?

02:36.623 --> 02:38.682
- It's raining though.
- Yes.

02:39.926 --> 02:43.630
'Even God gets jealous
of your good time.'

02:43.630 --> 02:46.190
What the heck this means?

02:46.533 --> 02:49.736
It's your fortune for today.
Year of the Sheep, right?

02:49.736 --> 02:51.203
Heard today's your last day.

02:51.538 --> 02:55.998
Don't work too hard.
Just keep the till balanced.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.508
- So long.
- Bye.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.704
- Take care.
- I will.

03:10.623 --> 03:15.328
MIN from SUNG's Gym won today.
He's got strong punch.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.931
Yes, he proved himself.

03:17.931 --> 03:22.035
It seems there's no rival for him
here in Korea.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.900
I wonder whom he will fight next.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.796
I'm on time, ain't l?

03:27.640 --> 03:30.944
Sweet jelly
and tangerines for you.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.646
This is for me!

03:33.646 --> 03:38.481
And your favorite ugly rolls.

03:38.618 --> 03:43.282
I even brought Soju.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.788
I can see
you're really impressed.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.696
Who are you?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.897
Who are you?
Where's grandpa?

03:54.734 --> 03:56.599
He quit today.

03:58.538 --> 04:01.006
Then why did you take them?

04:01.841 --> 04:03.001
You gave them to me.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.774
I used to watch TV shows
with him over snacks.

04:11.217 --> 04:13.583
Is he sick?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.822
Heard he's moving
to another city.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.187
I see.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.692
Sorry to interrupt.

04:39.045 --> 04:43.209
Hey, stay for a program.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.976
It's pouring.

04:51.924 --> 04:52.525
This is the one!

04:52.525 --> 04:56.529
Don't wear it.
I hate grey.

04:56.529 --> 05:01.796
You know why?
I'm grey!

05:03.236 --> 05:12.110
I also want to be primary color.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.909
Thank you for drama.

05:47.647 --> 05:51.083
Well, this tastes better than it looks.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.980
Right. It looks too bad.

06:01.928 --> 06:05.531
And you see that night jasmine?
Remember to water that once a week!

06:05.531 --> 06:07.499
It's very important.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.589
How can I help you?

06:41.033 --> 06:44.799
Telephone number for SUNG's Gym.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.508
See you tonight.

07:26.846 --> 07:30.475
Hello, customer service.

07:30.817 --> 07:33.920
I'll get you the nearest A/S center.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.323
There can be extra charges
for the visit, sir.

07:37.323 --> 07:40.326
I've been waiting fucking hours!
You only talk 'bout damn charges?

07:40.326 --> 07:43.529
Sorry for the inconvenience.

07:43.529 --> 07:51.838
There must've been mistakes.
Will put you to speed service.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.739
How about 5PM today?

07:53.739 --> 07:56.742
You'd better be right this time!
I made tons of calls for this shit!

07:56.742 --> 08:01.247
I apologize once again.
Is there anything... Sir?

08:01.247 --> 08:04.517
Why yells at me?
I'm not her kid.

08:04.517 --> 08:09.079
Royalty to your company!
Be nicer to the customer.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.286
Must be tired working night shift.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.593
I can sleep in.
It's better.

08:16.028 --> 08:21.591
You know you're the candidate
for employee of the month?

08:22.034 --> 08:23.092
Alight.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.712
Keep your arms down.

08:38.618 --> 08:41.883
Keep your guard up
even when you kick!

08:42.522 --> 08:46.185
Hold your back in
when you punch!

08:46.926 --> 08:51.590
Too many things to correct.
I can be better than you!

08:53.533 --> 08:59.301
Boss! Look who's here.

09:11.217 --> 09:16.086
I'm here to apologize.
I'm sorry, boss.

09:17.323 --> 09:21.783
Take this drink and smile,
will ya?

09:22.128 --> 09:26.497
You are a big man
so get over with the past!

09:28.134 --> 09:34.004
Past? I even couldn't feed
my own sons properly...

09:34.340 --> 09:36.900
... as I gave everything to him!

09:38.844 --> 09:41.005
Damn bastard!

09:48.220 --> 09:51.678
It's just they didn't like eating.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.531
Attention!
Look who's here.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.534
JANG Chul-min.

10:01.534 --> 10:06.339
National champion in '99.
He swept all game.

10:06.339 --> 10:11.043
All won by KOs
with a few punches.

10:11.043 --> 10:15.412
And I got beat up by him
at the final.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.476
It's been a while.

10:18.918 --> 10:22.822
Right. I forgot that.

10:22.822 --> 10:23.923
But Chul-min, remember.

10:23.923 --> 10:27.927
He's not the same guy
who you blew away.

10:27.927 --> 10:31.731
He's the best mixed martial arts player.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.497
He'll make it to UFC soon.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.137
I saw you on TV.
You were good.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.197
What? Good?

10:43.242 --> 10:46.145
How about sparring
for old time's sake?

10:46.145 --> 10:49.603
Stop it.
You're professional player now.

10:49.749 --> 10:52.018
He can't even stand for 1st round.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.384
Give him a break.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.023
- So long.
- Bye.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.786
Wind a bandage first.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.694
Just one round.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.595
I'm sorry, sir.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.500
Who let in this fool
who's not even a boxer?

11:13.739 --> 11:15.297
Get him out!

11:17.843 --> 11:19.105
Sorry.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.791
Do you mind opening the door?

11:35.127 --> 11:37.891
Sorry.
I'm sensitive to smell.

11:47.139 --> 11:50.597
I guess you worked out?

11:56.248 --> 11:58.375
What kind of clothing?

12:00.019 --> 12:02.021
Plain T-shirt.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.889
Not you.
I mean her from TV.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.494
- Skirt.
- And the shoes?

12:10.329 --> 12:13.232
- Yes.
- Of course, yes.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.598
I mean what kind of shoes
she wears.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.339
Woman's shoes.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.103
You mean flat shoes?

12:24.343 --> 12:25.605
And hair?

12:27.146 --> 12:28.247
Short perm.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.215
- Earrings?
- Hey.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.485
Why speak too much over drama?

12:34.120 --> 12:37.089
'Cause I cannot see it!

12:38.624 --> 12:40.785
What kind of earrings?

12:44.530 --> 12:47.397
Similar to yours.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.298
Really? You mean it?

13:12.024 --> 13:13.082
Hey.

13:14.727 --> 13:15.989
The lunch box.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.696
And the taste?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.497
Way better than it looked.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.696
I put some peaches.

13:24.837 --> 13:27.439
- Did you wash them?
- Yes.

13:27.439 --> 13:30.408
- Did you treat them nice?
- Pardon?

13:30.543 --> 13:33.846
You need to eat peach
right after washing carefully.

13:33.846 --> 13:38.374
They get bruises and
less sweet with touching.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.582
Thank you!

13:41.220 --> 13:46.385
By the way...
My name is Jung-hwa, not hey.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.594
You need to hold hands
when you greet us.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.803
Wow, it's so hard!
What do you do?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.383
Thank you for drama.

14:28.734 --> 14:32.938
Family offrogs get together.

14:32.938 --> 14:42.006
They sing all night Iong.

14:42.248 --> 14:46.776
They don't care
even nobody's Iistening.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.199
You got the new shoes?

16:12.538 --> 16:14.597
I can smell them.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.608
It's been already a few days.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.509
Drama shall start soon.
I'll be back.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.478
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.986
Don't go! I'm not OK!
I'm totally not OK!

16:37.830 --> 16:39.297
Don't go!

16:41.734 --> 16:42.792
Pardon?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.601
Teo says he's leaving.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.600
Is he crying now?

16:54.546 --> 16:55.604
Yes.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.882
He doesn't have to go
if it hurts him so bad.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.126
We can hear your hearts.

17:07.126 --> 17:10.686
Can feel better as we can't see.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.488
Handsome?

17:14.833 --> 17:18.394
- Of course, he is an actor.
- I mean you.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.606
Don't bluff as I can't see.

17:27.246 --> 17:31.717
People say I look manly.

17:31.717 --> 17:36.381
Means you are not a doll-face.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.914
Don't move!

18:17.529 --> 18:18.587
Are you okay?

18:21.533 --> 18:24.136
Oh my!
They're all shattered!

18:24.136 --> 18:26.438
I was supposed to watch them.
What shall I do?

18:26.438 --> 18:28.841
I'll pay for them.
Sorry.

18:28.841 --> 18:34.346
Why are you out at night
when you can't see?

18:34.346 --> 18:35.904
I'm sorry.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.616
I'm in a trouble.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.676
Would you please
watch the parking lot for me?

18:41.220 --> 18:43.085
I need to take her
to the hospital.

18:44.022 --> 18:48.186
No problem. Go now.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.691
What's your name?

18:59.638 --> 19:01.503
- Marcelino.
- What?

19:04.042 --> 19:05.805
JANG Marcelino.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.347
You are a foreigner?

19:08.347 --> 19:11.416
No, I'm Korean.

19:11.416 --> 19:15.621
And you're Jean Marcelino?

19:15.621 --> 19:16.781
Yes.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.389
Jean Marcelino?

19:21.727 --> 19:22.591
Correct.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.799
Wait.
Let's have some break.

19:34.940 --> 19:35.998
I can carry you on my back.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.403
You'll regret it.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.812
I'm fine. On my back.

19:45.717 --> 19:49.084
Don't complain later.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.482
No wily scheme.

20:34.633 --> 20:39.538
Hey! We're at the forked road.
Beauty shop at the right.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.199
Oh! Then...

20:41.740 --> 20:44.106
Go straight to your right.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.881
I warned you.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.593
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Totally.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.601
Then why am I coming down?

21:14.940 --> 21:18.744
And you see a kid at the corner?

21:18.744 --> 21:20.211
Better watch out!

21:35.127 --> 21:37.329
- Ouch! What are you?
- Mister!

21:37.329 --> 21:39.631
- What's wrong with you?
- I'll give you a shot!

21:39.631 --> 21:41.098
Mister, run!

21:43.035 --> 21:44.798
We're here.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.505
We're here.

21:53.745 --> 21:55.303
You must be exhausted.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.818
But a man should be strong.

21:59.818 --> 22:05.085
I'm really strong but
there were too many stairs.

22:06.525 --> 22:12.486
Can I ask one more favor
if you have some time?

22:12.631 --> 22:16.397
Give me a minute.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.772
Something's stuck in there?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.788
It looks like panties.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.726
Squirrels on it?

22:40.726 --> 22:42.694
- Squir...
- It was a gift.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.597
I've been looking all over.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.997
Now I found it.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.196
- Can I have a towel, please?
- Here you are.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.702
What kind of music do you like?

22:59.845 --> 23:03.508
The music radio plays.

23:07.018 --> 23:10.922
It's a reward for
carrying me all the way.

23:10.922 --> 23:13.584
Go with your friend.
Tickets for the concert.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.033
No thanks.
I don't know music.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.935
Don't have anyone to go with.

23:23.935 --> 23:27.302
Pity you don't have friends at all.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.804
Want me to go with you?

23:57.836 --> 24:02.140
How do you like your hair done?

24:02.140 --> 24:06.945
How about digital perm
which is hip in Paris?

24:06.945 --> 24:12.217
Your petit and elegant face
will go along with it for sure.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.582
- You sure?
- Of course!

24:13.919 --> 24:16.822
How about hair from that drama...

24:16.822 --> 24:17.923
How dare you!

24:17.923 --> 24:22.087
So out of fashion!
We're in a digital era.

24:22.427 --> 24:23.929
Then whatever you say.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.489
You have a date, right?

24:26.832 --> 24:29.596
- No.
- If you don't want to talk...

24:29.734 --> 24:32.498
Let's go for the digital perm.

24:37.943 --> 24:39.808
The pink lipstick is...

24:41.346 --> 24:42.813
Pink...

24:52.724 --> 24:54.783
No. 3, No. 4...

25:28.426 --> 25:30.087
I hope you didn't wait long.

25:33.131 --> 25:41.402
¢Ý FIower's in bloom in my heart.

25:42.040 --> 25:49.811
¢Ý You're the flower.

25:50.916 --> 25:59.483
¢Ý Petals are Ieading me...

25:59.925 --> 26:06.990
¢Ý... into your arms...

26:08.934 --> 26:18.707
¢Ý It's you who I've been waiting for.

26:18.944 --> 26:26.518
¢Ý You don't know how Ionely I've been...

26:26.518 --> 26:28.577
What does female vocalist look like?

26:33.325 --> 26:37.284
She is a woman with big eyes

26:37.729 --> 26:39.890
and long hair.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.506
The concert really hit the spot!

26:48.740 --> 26:51.300
It's been so long
since I went to the concert.

26:52.043 --> 26:55.146
Got your hair done?

26:55.146 --> 26:57.671
You don't like it?

26:58.316 --> 27:01.519
I like it.
Aren't you hungry?

27:01.519 --> 27:04.923
There's one place I really wanna go.

27:04.923 --> 27:09.383
I've been there often
with the one I loved.

27:09.527 --> 27:11.290
Not sure if it's still there though.

27:16.234 --> 27:17.997
Nice.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.717
You know 'Le Penseur'?

27:32.717 --> 27:35.220
A sculpture by Rodin?

27:35.220 --> 27:40.590
He has really short toenails.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.290
I know this as I studied sculpture
at school.

27:45.530 --> 27:49.489
But I can't remember things
I saw everyday.

27:49.934 --> 27:57.397
Like flowers at our garden,
where my beauty spot is,

27:57.542 --> 27:59.407
... and face of my dad.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.975
The one I loved is my dad.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.284
I should've watched him carefully.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.789
If I remember them,
I can still see them.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.405
I know you work at parking lot.
And during daytime?

28:30.542 --> 28:35.002
I deliver the waters.

28:35.847 --> 28:38.475
What did you do?
When you were young?

28:40.318 --> 28:45.779
You lived restless life
doing bad things?

28:50.929 --> 28:54.387
Mind your business.

28:59.637 --> 29:02.606
I can take it as you ignored me just now.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.212
Why can't you be honest?

29:09.047 --> 29:12.417
You know how I feel now?

29:12.417 --> 29:16.478
I don't know and don't care.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.889
But I surely know
what you ate in the morning.

29:32.036 --> 29:37.599
Yes, I show the people
what I eat everyday.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.610
Excuse me.

29:58.029 --> 30:01.487
Sorry you had a hard day
because of me.

30:02.934 --> 30:09.100
Sorry for bothering you.
Good bye.

30:13.344 --> 30:18.680
I'm now thirty.

30:19.918 --> 30:23.684
I was a boxer.
And when I was young...

30:26.324 --> 30:30.988
I was really a bad boy.
Really.

30:32.931 --> 30:37.391
But now I try not to be.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.300
That's who I am.

30:42.140 --> 30:47.601
I couldn't tell you
because I feel ashamed.

30:49.347 --> 30:53.283
Not because I ignored you.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.385
Good night.

31:13.838 --> 31:18.901
Thank you.
Have a good day.

31:27.118 --> 31:28.119
Yes.

31:28.119 --> 31:30.883
Jung-hwa, come to my room.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.293
Sit down.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.901
A present for you.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.300
Why?

31:49.440 --> 31:52.944
Why didn't you tell me
your birthday was last week?

31:52.944 --> 31:56.047
You really don't have to.
Thanks.

31:56.047 --> 31:59.380
Let's have dinner next week.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.284
Need to get back to work.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.701
I hate this awkward mood.

32:52.837 --> 32:53.938
Hey, Chul-min!

32:53.938 --> 32:58.543
Come back to gym.
Boss and I need you.

32:58.543 --> 33:00.602
Let's start all over again.

33:02.347 --> 33:03.748
I'm sorry.

33:03.748 --> 33:09.084
I'll ask one question.
Where have you been?

33:14.025 --> 33:18.229
I don't know much
as I didn't learn much.

33:18.229 --> 33:20.493
But I know damn well
your fist is really powerful.

33:21.232 --> 33:25.737
Boxing is out of fashion now.
People don't watch it.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.900
Asian champ earns only 3K a year.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.708
Let's do mixed martial arts.

33:33.244 --> 33:37.476
It's a shame that you don't use
that powerful fist!

33:42.520 --> 33:46.684
If you got nothing to say,
I'm leaving.

33:47.725 --> 33:48.783
Boss.

33:51.229 --> 33:56.599
I was in prison.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.193
What?

34:00.238 --> 34:02.798
For 4 years and 3 months.

34:25.129 --> 34:27.231
After I quitted boxing...

34:27.231 --> 34:31.793
I beat up the people
to collect their debts.

35:02.533 --> 35:08.995
I sent my kids to orphanage.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.599
My wife ran away.

35:14.445 --> 35:22.284
Your parents must've sung
a lullaby to you.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.088
But I can't do that...

35:29.727 --> 35:34.687
This is all I've got, bastard!

35:38.536 --> 35:43.599
Nobody sang a damn lullaby to me.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.412
I'm an orphan!

35:51.516 --> 35:53.117
Hey, open the door!

35:53.117 --> 35:54.277
Who the hell?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.301
Brother Marcelino?

36:11.936 --> 36:16.202
I told you you look
much nicer when you smile.

36:17.241 --> 36:21.109
You see?
You have to keep that smile.

36:22.346 --> 36:28.285
Can't we change
baptismal name, Sister?

36:28.519 --> 36:32.285
Why? Sounds like an actor!

36:32.523 --> 36:35.583
JANG Marcelino!

36:35.726 --> 36:38.490
I was so happy to
receive that name for you.

36:43.234 --> 36:46.203
People from our order made this.

36:47.638 --> 36:50.505
Got a girlfriend to give that?

37:06.924 --> 37:08.226
Who is it?

37:08.226 --> 37:11.028
So you're living here?

37:11.028 --> 37:12.430
Captain MA?

37:12.430 --> 37:15.399
Why do you lie?

37:16.234 --> 37:19.897
You don't have any plan after work.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.599
Let's have tea together.

37:34.318 --> 37:38.687
Sorry there's no hot tea.
I can't use the fire.

37:38.923 --> 37:44.088
Sorry I couldn't think that.

37:47.031 --> 37:50.489
Must be scared to live alone.

37:56.240 --> 38:00.199
Was it during the college?
That accident?

38:01.646 --> 38:07.175
I'm so sorry.
Sure boys went crazy 'bout you.

38:08.719 --> 38:12.678
Please leave now.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.592
Does your wife know
what you're doing?

38:20.631 --> 38:25.796
You didn't even open the present.

38:28.339 --> 38:36.906
I got divorced recently
for beating up my wife.

38:39.216 --> 38:42.276
I knew it.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.385
It really looks good on you!

38:44.922 --> 38:48.187
You don't know how pretty you are.

38:54.532 --> 38:55.590
Damn!

38:58.235 --> 39:02.899
It's not for one time sex.
I can buy much prettier girls for that.

39:03.541 --> 39:08.103
You need to know
how I feel about you.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.470
Stay still.

39:12.917 --> 39:18.522
Want me to rape you?
That's what you want?

39:18.522 --> 39:21.082
Please stop!

39:21.625 --> 39:22.683
Stop right now!

39:38.142 --> 39:39.143
Please stop.

39:39.143 --> 39:43.914
Well... I work with Jung-hwa.

39:43.914 --> 39:44.881
I'm here to just to have tea.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.696
Please stop it, Mister!

40:10.241 --> 40:12.106
Look me in the eyes.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.979
I'll kill you if I see you again.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.002
Jung-hwa.

40:42.239 --> 40:43.399
Are you okay?

40:47.144 --> 40:48.805
Why did you do that?

40:50.815 --> 40:55.019
What if he fires me?

40:55.019 --> 40:58.682
Do you still want that job?

40:59.323 --> 41:02.426
Why put up with harassment?

41:02.426 --> 41:04.291
Because I need to survive!

41:05.930 --> 41:07.693
I have to live.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.935
I'll take care of you.
I will.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.802
You'll get the new job for me?

41:14.538 --> 41:17.098
Or you'll come to rescue
whenever it happens?

41:20.044 --> 41:22.512
What do you think you are?

41:26.617 --> 41:29.984
I'll help you.

41:31.822 --> 41:38.386
You're making me more miserable.

41:52.443 --> 41:54.001
Please leave now.

43:49.526 --> 43:50.788
When did you come?

43:54.632 --> 43:56.190
A while ago.

43:58.435 --> 44:00.096
I quit.

44:01.538 --> 44:05.406
I feel so cramped inside.

44:06.143 --> 44:11.171
Will you take me out
this weekend?

44:13.517 --> 44:15.719
You're not answering?

44:15.719 --> 44:17.880
You said to take care of me.

44:18.022 --> 44:20.388
Then you can do that at least.
Right?

44:22.026 --> 44:25.189
Yes, I'll.

44:49.319 --> 44:50.286
Take this.

44:51.622 --> 44:56.527
What is it?

44:56.527 --> 44:59.930
He'll keep you company.

44:59.930 --> 45:01.932
He will be the eye dog
when he grows up.

45:01.932 --> 45:03.934
Is he Golden Retriever?

45:03.934 --> 45:05.035
Yes.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.196
Oh my!

45:08.939 --> 45:11.999
What shall we call him?

45:12.543 --> 45:14.645
- How about Easy?
- Easy?

45:14.645 --> 45:17.375
To live in easy.

45:19.416 --> 45:22.476
Then he's Jean Easy?

45:22.920 --> 45:26.083
Nice to see you, Easy!

45:42.639 --> 45:44.607
I grew up in the orphanage
across this river.

45:46.043 --> 45:51.982
We swam and did fishing here.

45:54.218 --> 45:58.780
Now orphanage is flooded.

45:59.523 --> 46:05.393
The only place I remember
is under water.

46:07.731 --> 46:11.895
Mister, get a pebble for me.

46:21.945 --> 46:25.472
This pebble feels exactly like you.

46:25.916 --> 46:29.119
I'll carry it always
taking it as you.

46:29.119 --> 46:33.988
So you carry this
taking as me.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.394
You're so warm.

46:56.547 --> 47:01.518
There must be a reason
to come back now.

47:01.518 --> 47:05.978
He wants to earn the money.
What's wrong with that?

47:06.223 --> 47:10.427
Let's make it to UFC!

47:10.427 --> 47:12.395
USA!

47:54.838 --> 47:56.396
Wanna read, Easy?

48:08.819 --> 48:10.980
Come in harder.

48:12.422 --> 48:13.787
Take your time.

48:38.315 --> 48:40.078
Table on your right.

48:41.018 --> 48:43.077
You even rounded the corners?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.779
Moved furnitures a bit.

48:53.030 --> 48:55.897
Doorsill is gone, too.

49:00.237 --> 49:01.602
There's a bed.

49:13.917 --> 49:17.375
I got the new window
to let the sun in.

49:32.836 --> 49:35.202
- Why?
- I wanna see you.

50:13.243 --> 50:19.375
It makes me see you.

50:22.819 --> 50:27.188
Are you looking at my eyes?

50:27.724 --> 50:29.126
Yes.

50:29.126 --> 50:30.491
You're lying.

51:29.619 --> 51:31.382
Good job!

51:46.336 --> 51:47.394
Must be hurt.

52:25.041 --> 52:28.204
- I'm not a good dancer.
- I can see that.

53:10.120 --> 53:13.223
I used to like raining.

53:13.223 --> 53:16.192
But now I hate it.

53:17.227 --> 53:18.387
Why?

53:20.030 --> 53:21.190
No reason.

53:23.533 --> 53:24.693
Turn around.

53:25.135 --> 53:27.296
- Why?
- Just turn around!

53:28.038 --> 53:30.506
What are you trying now?

53:34.244 --> 53:39.876
After pressing the muscle
near backbone with a thumb...

53:40.717 --> 53:42.018
Does it hurt?

53:42.018 --> 53:44.987
No. It feels good.

54:00.637 --> 54:04.441
What did it say?
The line on notebook?

54:04.441 --> 54:07.544
You wanna learn braille?

54:07.544 --> 54:09.205
Just curious.

54:09.446 --> 54:12.279
It's a line from 'Romeo & Juliet.'

54:12.916 --> 54:16.477
'Her eye discourses.'

54:16.620 --> 54:20.283
'l will answer it.'

54:23.226 --> 54:25.128
Why learn massage?

54:25.128 --> 54:29.394
Well...You never know.
It can relax you.

54:30.133 --> 54:32.235
Be sure not to get hurt.

54:32.235 --> 54:34.537
I sense you get face swollen often.

54:34.537 --> 54:37.802
It's for fun. Not a big deal.

54:38.141 --> 54:43.346
Wanna open your workshop!

54:43.346 --> 54:46.782
You can make plates and vases...

54:48.718 --> 54:51.585
I'll do the delivery!

55:24.821 --> 55:29.190
Let go with armlock, trust yourself!
Go for it.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.896
Move forward.

56:05.729 --> 56:07.890
Break! Break!

56:19.843 --> 56:21.606
You did good!

56:22.545 --> 56:25.378
Well done.

56:28.918 --> 56:31.521
They added $100 more
to original $300.

56:31.521 --> 56:33.623
Also we got some tips!

56:33.623 --> 56:37.787
Hey, you were still okay!

56:39.729 --> 56:41.030
Hey!

56:41.030 --> 56:47.036
Come to the official league
and let's have a great fight.

56:47.036 --> 56:50.199
Bro, long time no see?

56:50.640 --> 56:54.144
I'm not your bro.

56:54.144 --> 56:57.213
We don't share the blood.

56:57.213 --> 57:01.081
You could've come out with me.

57:04.120 --> 57:05.485
Let's go.

57:06.222 --> 57:08.190
See you soon on the ring.

57:10.627 --> 57:15.231
That son of bitch
left us for the big money.

57:15.231 --> 57:19.099
He couldn't pay his rent.
Now he's driving a Benz.

57:20.336 --> 57:23.703
Bro, please cut here.

57:24.140 --> 57:26.506
That'll go down soon.

57:27.744 --> 57:29.145
She'll kill me.

57:29.145 --> 57:31.670
But you're happy.

57:31.815 --> 57:34.375
Can't stop smiling?

57:37.020 --> 57:39.022
- Here it goes.
- Wait!

57:39.022 --> 57:42.788
Come on, it's not the first time.

57:44.627 --> 57:49.332
You hurt the lonely guy's feeling

57:49.332 --> 57:52.392
so you deserve to be hurt.

57:57.240 --> 57:59.902
Yes, blood is coming.

58:00.543 --> 58:03.774
But you just can't stop smiling,
can you?

58:10.520 --> 58:14.183
- I'm home.
- How was the fight? Let me see.

58:21.431 --> 58:23.296
Not bad.

58:26.436 --> 58:28.338
Going somewhere?

58:28.338 --> 58:30.440
Tomorrow's holiday.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.204
Wanna go somewhere with you.

58:48.124 --> 58:53.289
Meet my parents, Mister.

58:56.933 --> 59:00.596
How do you do?

59:01.237 --> 59:03.797
Hi Dad. You like him?

59:04.140 --> 59:07.109
You told me to bring
my boyfriend if I get one.

59:08.344 --> 59:15.273
Mom, what? He's tall
but not good looking?

59:16.920 --> 59:22.381
I knew he's a good guy
when I first met him...

59:22.625 --> 59:25.685
... as he got a real warm voice.

59:40.543 --> 59:46.880
It was a Childrens' Day.
We went for a family trip.

59:48.418 --> 59:51.683
It was raining but I insisted...

59:53.823 --> 01:00:00.592
I wanted to do something
before my graduation.

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.684
I'm an orphan!

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.586
- Hey. Open the door!
- Who the hell?

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.629
What is it?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.932
Police. Someone reported
hearing the beating here.

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.490
Open the door! Quick!

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:41.101
Open up!

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.243
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:50.110
Don't live like this.
You'll regret it.

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.579
I wish they weren't hurt...

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.281
I really do...

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:14.588
They must be watching over me.

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:19.499
I believe they sent you.

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.596
Jung-hwa?

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.782
Is it you?

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.587
Sit down, please.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:25.297
The regression is fully progressed.

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.536
Ifyou Ieave her Iike this...

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.902
she'II Iose eyesight forever
within a month.

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:33.342
Is there any other way
than waiting for doner?

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:36.311
Actually, there is...

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:02.595
Here!

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:11.873
What brought you here?

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:16.084
I need some money.

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:19.179
- How much?
- $30,000.

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.688
By when?

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:24.192
As soon as possible.

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:31.798
Life is full of surprises.

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:35.495
I used to ask you the money.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.881
There is one chance.

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.383
Do you really need the money?

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.185
- Wait!
- Let's go.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.187
Hold on tight!

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:13.802
Are you okay?

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:17.678
- Jung-hwa?
- Why was that?

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:21.074
What took you long
to take me to this fun?

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.985
- Let's get the operation.
- What?

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:30.588
Doc said we can buy
the cornea from the States.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:34.793
You knew this, right?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.396
We can't afford it.

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:42.900
Don't worry.
I have some savings.

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:49.004
I like the way we are now.
Having you beside me...

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:51.679
... makes me happier than ever.

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:56.274
It's now or never.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:04.486
Whenever I think of that day

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:08.388
and what happened to mom and dad,

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:12.894
I feel guilty and it hurts so bad.

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:17.103
I feel I don't deserve to survive.

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:22.106
I feel better being blind.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.976
Don't wanna see me?

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.284
How about babies we'll have?

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:35.789
Don't wanna see them?

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.290
Married?

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:46.194
No, sir.

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:48.696
Girlfriend?

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.604
Yes.

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:56.746
It can be really dangerous...

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.373
Are you okay with that?

01:06:58.514 --> 01:06:59.981
I won't fail.

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:06.179
$30,000 for advance.
A duplicate phone for you.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:15.731
This is nothing
but ordinary fight.

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:21.601
But when Thai police finds out,
it gets complicated.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:29.402
Nobody can help you
if you get caught, understand?

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.481
You're not answering?

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.879
I get it.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:58.503
Take good care of her, Easy.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:10.277
Your family can get hurt.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:15.584
So be sure that
nobody can track you.

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.986
You know what I mean?

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.395
Are you crazy?

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:27.091
Told you not to deal with Tae-sik.

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.939
Don't know what you're doing.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.041
It's only one fight.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:34.143
We finally got into the official league

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.407
after all these sufferings!

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:40.276
Is this for her eyes?

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:47.523
If something happens,
... balance will be wired.

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.889
Please give it to her.

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.495
What if you become crippled?

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:58.296
You've got only one life to live!

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.203
I won't regret it.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:20.282
- You're right.
- About what?

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:25.892
I wanna see sunset with you,

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:28.330
also lovely Easy,

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:37.398
... our house you fixed,
river we went together.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.505
And...

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:46.374
I'll lie on my bed
and see your face only.

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:51.379
For about 23 hours a day?
One hour for my face.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:10:00.187
What if you look a lot
uglier than I think?

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:08.001
You'd better get prepared.

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:13.342
I look really bad.
You might not recognize me.

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:16.607
Never.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:22.478
I'm so nervous.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.691
See you soon!

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.600
See you.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.489
You'll be waiting for me?
Not going anywhere?

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:08.194
I've got no place to go.

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.089
See you soon.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:51.398
Memorize your name and address.
Isn't Kim Hak-sun the nice name?

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.905
It was difficult to find three-no's.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:12:01.080
No relative, no conviction,
not wanted.

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:11.281
Never saw
you get nervous like this.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:15.781
This bastard already
put many into death.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:20.493
Don't even try to win.
Try to survive.

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.237
There's no rule.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:32.901
Game ends only
when one dies or passes out.

01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:01.498
Wanna know whom I bet on?

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:05.500
Sweat it out, Doggy.

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:56.327
You knew he's this strong?

01:17:57.439 --> 01:18:00.499
Bring my money back
if you don't want to die.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:31.989
Ifyou win,
they'II give you the bet,

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:36.903
a dimond of 10 carats
instead of millions of dollors.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:44.676
When you can bring it safe,
I will add up $20,000.

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:52.375
How's the result of
HA Jung-hwa's operation?

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:03.796
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:18.013
- Hello.
- I arrived safe.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:20.982
- Got that thing with you?
- Yes.

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:25.620
Someone might tag along,
so call once you get Incheon St.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.178
I see.

01:21:36.825 --> 01:21:38.588
That's it.

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:48.694
No call from him yet?

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:01.917
DISAPPEARNCE REPORT

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.284
Your relation to him?
His wife?

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.623
No.

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.682
Sister?

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:14.529
I'll accept this for now but...

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:17.732
...you don't know his social security number
and are not legal relative.

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:21.293
If you are a girlfriend,
just wait at home.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:28.107
People report disappearance
to track the debtors.

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:37.619
You're so stubborn.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:40.522
We need to tear this building down...

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.524
You are the last one.

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:47.086
You have one week left!
That's it!

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:07.315
You're moving!
Thank god, it was close.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.976
Package for Mr. JANG.

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:28.195
Marcelino's girlfriend.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:32.500
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jung-hwa.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:35.300
Please sit there.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:48.278
Good that you can see now.

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:57.489
Chul-min told me 'bout you.

01:23:57.632 --> 01:24:01.398
He said you're very beautiful.

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:14.871
May 5th, the day I got accident

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:22.584
... is the day you got hurt.

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:27.984
It was raining.

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:42.858
2 YEARS LATER

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:47.235
Your design is very warm...

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:49.601
and the color is very elegant.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:55.002
The order details are all in here.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:58.579
Can we get 52 pieces
within this month?

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:02.674
Sure! Thank you.
I'll make them nice.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:05.978
You're not married?

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:09.779
I am.

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:17.697
Well, the beautiful and talented
are always taken.

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:20.999
- Happy to work with you.
- Me, too.

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.376
Hello.

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:42.590
Of course, I will.

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:47.293
See you on weekend.

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.695
Hello, director.

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:54.335
You're amazing to come regularly.

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.436
Not at all.

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:58.200
Everyone gets crazy
'bout your massage.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.408
Hello.

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:08.080
Grandpa.
How have you been?

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:15.187
Bad.
My joints are stiff and sore.

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:19.427
I'll leave this pot here.
I made it myself.

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:24.091
You are good
at so many things!

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:29.902
You must've exercised.
You got much better.

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:10.667
Hello.
I guess you are new here.

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:14.670
He's transferred from lncheon.

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.920
Can't you speak?

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.687
Guess so.
He didn't speak a word.

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:26.493
Let me give you massage.

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:55.180
You lost lots of muscle.

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:40.198
I'll turn you around.

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:12.095
NAME: KIM HAK-SUN

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.893
You'll get well soon.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:45.899
I'm pretty sure.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.822
I'll leave it here for now.

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.224
Isn't it a turtle?

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:46.127
It seems sick.
I'll take it to doctor.

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:49.290
- Will go get some colors.
- Okay.

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:50.590
Let's go.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.324
It's evening primrose.
We call it night jasmine too.

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:18.726
Only blooms at night.
Very beautiful.

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.694
Do you want this?

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:47.679
Easy! Easy!

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:54.392
Are you okay?
Come here, Easy!

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:56.086
Are you okay?

01:33:57.632 --> 01:33:59.896
Can you stand up?

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:03.537
I'm sorry.
He's usually calm.

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:06.097
Are you okay?

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:09.104
Are you...

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:15.373
I think we met at hospital?

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:23.290
Where are you going?
Let me take you.

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:39.802
What is wrong with you, Easy?
Stay calm!

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:18.368
- I left my wallet.
- I see.

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.384
Where is the turtle?

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.382
You left it there.

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:48.206
What is it, Jung-hwa?

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:56.772
Did a guy on crutch...
come here just now?

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:58.376
Yes.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.483
He bought night jasmine.

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:54.635
Yes, the one with the scar
in the last room on 2nd fl.

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:59.800
His name is different...
He Ieft a few weeks ago.

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.290
Mister!

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:36.398
I told you...

01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:40.805
I would see your face only.

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:48.782
Why did you make me
see only mine?

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.981
I'm sorry, Mister.

01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:34.091
I'm really sorry.

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:52.976
Look at me

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:58.681
Look into my eyes!

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:41.994
I missed you.

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:58.571
Jung-Hwa, I love you.
