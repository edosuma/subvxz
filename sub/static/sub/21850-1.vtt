04:06.787 --> 04:10.854
Welcome to detention, boys and girls.

04:10.856 --> 04:14.258
Officer Pete, will you please escort these

04:14.260 --> 04:17.128
'children to the detention room?'

04:17.130 --> 04:19.300
I'll be joining you shortly.

04:29.943 --> 04:32.079
Wanna cuff me, hall cop?

06:10.811 --> 06:12.279
Ugh.

06:51.952 --> 06:54.422
What's the story, gay and whorey?

06:58.892 --> 07:01.062
Ah, this is cute.

07:02.128 --> 07:04.294
Where'd you get this?

07:04.296 --> 07:07.364
Uh, I made it myself.

07:07.366 --> 07:08.936
Hmm.

07:28.888 --> 07:31.422
'Yes, my little Kernel Popcorn.'

07:31.424 --> 07:34.428
'Meow, meow. I love my meow.'

08:18.137 --> 08:20.438
I got you, Miss Presley.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.844
'Thank you very much, Jessica.'

08:25.878 --> 08:28.111
Good morning ladies and gentleman

08:28.113 --> 08:30.484
and welcome to Saturday detention.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.524
As we informed you and your parents

08:40.525 --> 08:42.893
'the school is being
fumigated for an unfortunate'

08:42.895 --> 08:46.163
and potentially rabid possum infestation.

08:46.165 --> 08:50.000
So the district has kindly
arranged for us to stay here

08:50.002 --> 08:53.437
and what was formerly
known as Way View Prison.

08:53.439 --> 08:56.242
Now it may seem a little worn

08:57.274 --> 08:58.976
little dark, maybe a little imposing.

08:58.978 --> 09:02.580
'But it still has that
institutional dependability.'

09:02.582 --> 09:07.018
Rule number one, there will be no talking.

09:07.020 --> 09:11.355
Rule number two, there will
be no leaving of your seats

09:11.357 --> 09:15.259
or this holding area
without permission from me.

09:15.261 --> 09:17.896
'And number three, in accordance
to the outreach effort'

09:17.898 --> 09:21.199
put forth to help those troubled teens

09:21.201 --> 09:25.470
with their feelings due
to the unfortunate suicide

09:25.472 --> 09:29.040
of your fellow classmate
Jenny Duke last spring

09:29.042 --> 09:33.511
you are all going to
write an 800 word essay

09:33.513 --> 09:35.282
entitled..

09:37.384 --> 09:39.854
...The Me You Don't See.

09:41.321 --> 09:43.988
Let me find out

09:43.990 --> 09:46.291
what really makes you tick.

09:46.293 --> 09:48.593
Hand these out, Barrett.

09:48.595 --> 09:50.327
Make sure everyone gets one.

09:50.329 --> 09:54.132
'And rule number four, which
is my personal favorite'

09:54.134 --> 09:58.036
all cellphones will be
handed to me at this time

09:58.038 --> 10:02.407
'and returned to the rightful
owners at 4 o'clock today.'

10:02.409 --> 10:05.276
Wake up. Cellphone time.

10:05.278 --> 10:07.144
Get them out, everybody.

10:07.146 --> 10:09.147
Oh, there goes that one. Good luck to you.

10:09.149 --> 10:11.215
I'm calling your mother, if you have one.

10:11.217 --> 10:13.250
Thank you, Jessica.

10:13.252 --> 10:15.655
Jesus saves. Thank you, Kevin.

10:17.624 --> 10:19.994
Lexi, may I have your phone?

10:26.399 --> 10:28.532
'Miss Presley.'

10:28.534 --> 10:30.500
Yes, Barrett.

10:30.502 --> 10:34.272
- So I'm a borderline diabetic.
- Oh.

10:34.274 --> 10:37.207
And I have this app on my
phone to track my blood sugar

10:37.209 --> 10:39.476
so I'm gonna have to keep it.

10:39.478 --> 10:42.412
Ha! Suck on this

10:42.414 --> 10:44.481
if you feel a coma coming on.

10:44.483 --> 10:47.384
Your phone is mine until 4 o'clock.

10:47.386 --> 10:50.120
Now..

10:50.122 --> 10:53.191
...number 2 premium pencils.

10:53.193 --> 10:55.258
There is nothing like the smell of this.

10:57.697 --> 11:01.465
Don't you love that smell?

11:01.467 --> 11:04.569
You know, all I smell is the stink

11:04.571 --> 11:08.406
of desperation and... middle age.

11:12.245 --> 11:16.214
Well, we can talk about the
real smell of desperation

11:16.216 --> 11:20.218
next Saturday when you
act like a hot ticket.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.723
Don't be surprised when you get punched.

11:25.558 --> 11:28.026
I am right across the hall.

11:28.028 --> 11:30.061
All I want to hear

11:30.063 --> 11:33.500
is the gentle scrape of pencils on paper.

11:36.770 --> 11:38.438
Thank you.

11:42.141 --> 11:44.077
I'll be watching you..

11:45.812 --> 11:47.481
...closely.

12:18.645 --> 12:21.311
I know you.

12:21.313 --> 12:24.617
You never talk.

12:26.151 --> 12:28.518
- Are you deaf?
- Shut up.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.723
Deaf people can't hear you.

13:06.659 --> 13:08.327
Nope. Ugh.

13:13.366 --> 13:14.701
Hello.

13:36.155 --> 13:37.491
Oh.

13:45.497 --> 13:47.633
What are you drawin'?

13:57.809 --> 14:00.478
Oh, I get it.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.882
He's your bae, so he's
not allowed to talk to me.

14:04.884 --> 14:07.585
Yeah, I get that a lot.

14:07.587 --> 14:09.686
The jealousy thing.

14:09.688 --> 14:11.522
'But don't worry, honey.'

14:11.524 --> 14:14.892
Just because he sees what's
in the vending machine

14:14.894 --> 14:19.330
doesn't mean he's getting any candy.

14:19.332 --> 14:20.833
You're gross.

14:22.568 --> 14:24.936
Whatever she just gets
off from the attention.

14:24.938 --> 14:27.540
How do you know what gets me off?

14:35.615 --> 14:39.216
Ah! Naughty, naughty.

14:39.218 --> 14:42.552
This is a flyer for a drinking party.

14:42.554 --> 14:45.855
What do you school-spirit
types do to get turned?

14:45.857 --> 14:47.825
- Why do you care?
- Oh, that's right.

14:47.827 --> 14:48.993
You probably don't drink.

14:48.995 --> 14:50.360
Aren't you training

14:50.362 --> 14:51.829
for the Special Olympics or something?

14:51.831 --> 14:54.368
- The Junior Olympics.
- Yeah.

15:00.305 --> 15:02.375
What's your name again?

15:04.510 --> 15:05.875
Barrett.

15:05.877 --> 15:08.678
Barrette?

15:08.680 --> 15:12.249
Why did your parents name
you after a hair clip?

15:12.251 --> 15:14.951
Your mouth is so pretty when it's closed.

15:14.953 --> 15:18.824
But I can do so many cool
things when it's open.

15:32.904 --> 15:34.604
You know what?

15:34.606 --> 15:38.508
I think we have a big
fat faker in our midst.

15:38.510 --> 15:39.880
Huh?

15:49.922 --> 15:52.822
Maybe she's dead.

15:52.824 --> 15:55.494
She sure smells like it.

15:56.895 --> 15:58.998
Don't poke the weirdo.

16:00.566 --> 16:02.603
Just leave her alone.

16:05.904 --> 16:09.340
Woo-ooh! Hello?

16:18.518 --> 16:21.351
Let go of me, you freak!

16:21.353 --> 16:22.519
'Ugh, you're so..'

16:23.755 --> 16:26.324
'...I'm telling you, freak.'

16:26.326 --> 16:27.861
Jesus Christ.

16:31.097 --> 16:32.632
Shit.

16:33.566 --> 16:35.099
Ah, son of a bitch.

16:38.371 --> 16:40.904
What is going on in here?

16:40.906 --> 16:42.773
You're supposed to be writing your essays?

16:42.775 --> 16:45.609
I thought I made the
rules clear, Alexandra.

16:45.611 --> 16:47.378
What? I'm just stretching.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.812
Well, you just stretched yourself

16:48.814 --> 16:50.880
into another Saturday detention.

16:50.882 --> 16:53.683
Miss Presley.

16:53.685 --> 16:56.653
I'm starting to think
you have a crush on me.

16:56.655 --> 16:58.455
You sure like spending time together.

16:58.457 --> 17:01.725
I could say the same thing about you.

17:01.727 --> 17:03.494
Any more outbursts

17:03.496 --> 17:06.396
and all of you will earn another detention.

17:06.398 --> 17:07.598
'Is that clear?'

17:09.601 --> 17:11.368
Yes, ma'am.

17:11.371 --> 17:13.002
I gotta take care of this.

17:15.907 --> 17:18.876
Would you mind not dragging the rest of us

17:18.877 --> 17:21.348
into your black hole
of juvenile delinquency?

17:22.915 --> 17:24.647
I bet some of you would love

17:24.650 --> 17:27.086
to be dragged into my black hole.

17:29.522 --> 17:30.756
Ooh.

17:33.993 --> 17:35.693
You wanna have some fun?

17:35.695 --> 17:37.528
Haven't you caused enough damage today?

17:37.530 --> 17:39.096
'Sit down.'

17:39.098 --> 17:41.902
If she catches you, the rest of us get it.

17:44.937 --> 17:46.973
Wish me luck, hair clip.

18:03.121 --> 18:04.658
Damn.

18:23.909 --> 18:25.879
Phoo, phoop.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.515
Ooh, woop!

18:36.121 --> 18:38.555
Ooh!

18:41.960 --> 18:43.627
Ah!

18:43.629 --> 18:44.727
Put it back.

18:44.729 --> 18:46.830
Hell, no.

18:46.832 --> 18:49.567
This is mine.

18:49.569 --> 18:52.639
You're going to get us
all a month of Saturdays.

18:56.775 --> 18:58.842
What is that? Some kind
of giant glass dildo?

19:00.111 --> 19:02.146
Shut up. Here she comes.

19:03.649 --> 19:06.216
- Lexi.
- There you go.

19:06.218 --> 19:07.885
- What is going on?
- What?

19:07.887 --> 19:09.853
Don't act coy, sister.

19:09.855 --> 19:12.188
I can tell from that little
smug smirk on your face

19:12.190 --> 19:13.590
that you're up to somethin'.

19:13.592 --> 19:15.192
Why, Miss Presley, I have no idea

19:15.194 --> 19:16.860
what you're talking about.

19:16.862 --> 19:19.565
I have just been working on my essay.

19:24.803 --> 19:27.170
I would expect more from an elite athlete.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.840
I already finished my paper, Miss Presley.

19:29.842 --> 19:32.012
I am superbly disappointed.

19:34.746 --> 19:36.216
I'm sorry.

19:40.986 --> 19:43.521
'You, what do you know?'

19:43.523 --> 19:45.121
- Get it.
- What? Are you kidding me?

19:47.526 --> 19:49.225
Oh! Are you.. Are you..

19:49.227 --> 19:51.230
- Really? No...
- Kevin.

19:53.666 --> 19:57.201
I assume that you are incapable of lying.

19:57.203 --> 19:59.936
So what the hell are
these delinquents up to?

19:59.938 --> 20:02.942
I, uh, I honestly have
no idea, Miss Presley.

20:04.310 --> 20:09.112
- Um..
- Do you take me to be a fool?

20:09.114 --> 20:13.519
Do you think you can pull
one over on old Miss Presley?

20:14.820 --> 20:16.986
You know, I can read your mind.

20:16.988 --> 20:19.255
'I can read all of your minds.'

20:19.257 --> 20:20.791
Old Miss Presley.

20:20.793 --> 20:22.059
Listen to me, you little thuglet.

20:24.930 --> 20:27.700
I know it's you and I know that
you are up to something no good.

20:29.134 --> 20:31.769
You know what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna drag you outside

20:31.771 --> 20:34.972
in the hallway and rip
each and every one of those

20:34.974 --> 20:39.208
disgusting, ridiculous
piercings out of your body

20:39.210 --> 20:43.179
so that you give up in a
blood, snot and tear-filled

20:43.181 --> 20:45.784
torrent of shame and regret.

20:52.624 --> 20:54.627
Now what the F?

20:58.598 --> 20:59.964
I have to take this.

20:59.966 --> 21:03.067
Noses in your pages and mouths shut.

21:03.069 --> 21:04.704
This isn't over!

21:36.034 --> 21:39.903
'No! No! No! No!'

21:39.905 --> 21:41.671
'You get away from me!'

21:41.673 --> 21:44.675
'Get him. Oh, God! Oh, God! No!'

21:44.677 --> 21:47.043
Open this door! Open this door!

21:47.045 --> 21:49.812
Let me in! Let me in!

21:49.814 --> 21:52.148
No! No! Let me in! Let me in!

21:52.150 --> 21:54.651
Looks like we got
ourselves a little privacy.

21:56.755 --> 21:58.054
Open the door.

22:02.294 --> 22:04.227
- 'Oh, my God!'
- I don't have a death wish?

22:04.229 --> 22:05.396
This is beautiful.

22:05.398 --> 22:08.134
Get off me. Please, no! Stop!

22:11.403 --> 22:13.936
'Oh, God! Oh, God!'

22:29.721 --> 22:31.724
It's locked.

22:40.466 --> 22:43.233
It's a prison. No amount of
karate is gonna open this.

22:43.235 --> 22:45.038
What about Presley?

22:51.976 --> 22:53.846
Sweet baby Jesus.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.782
I don't do bodily fluids.

22:58.784 --> 23:01.150
- We have to help her.
- And what?

23:01.152 --> 23:02.886
Let the succubus that just turned Presley

23:02.888 --> 23:04.288
into a smoothie in.

23:04.290 --> 23:07.390
- She's got a point.
- When did you turn Team Skank?

23:07.392 --> 23:08.992
Who says skank anymore?

23:08.994 --> 23:11.895
I have had about all I can take from you.

23:11.897 --> 23:13.830
- Bring it.
- Yeah?

23:13.832 --> 23:15.299
- Yeah. Come on.
- Fine. Stop...

23:15.301 --> 23:17.734
'Help!'

23:17.736 --> 23:19.906
I can't hear a thing!

23:26.344 --> 23:28.145
Hello?

23:28.147 --> 23:30.013
Hello?

23:30.015 --> 23:31.383
Hello?

23:34.986 --> 23:37.454
Hello? Is anybody there?

23:37.456 --> 23:39.693
Somebody help us, please. Hello?

23:41.459 --> 23:43.095
It's dead.

23:46.832 --> 23:49.366
Horribly ironic choice of words.

23:49.368 --> 23:52.235
There's got to be another
phone in here somewhere.

23:52.237 --> 23:54.871
I'm not dying in detention today.

23:54.873 --> 23:56.439
Nobody is dead.

23:56.441 --> 23:59.976
Um, there is pretty compelling
evidence to the contrary

23:59.978 --> 24:03.246
coming under the door out there.

24:03.248 --> 24:05.485
I am going to find a way out.

24:07.253 --> 24:08.351
- Ah!
- Oh, what..

24:10.488 --> 24:12.356
Now what are we gonna do?

24:12.358 --> 24:14.858
'Attention, students.'

24:14.860 --> 24:17.394
There is a ghost. There is.

24:17.396 --> 24:19.329
No, there is no such thing as ghosts.

24:19.331 --> 24:21.063
Oh, yeah?

24:21.065 --> 24:22.800
'This prison is unavoidably'

24:22.802 --> 24:24.534
'detained at this time.'

24:24.536 --> 24:26.969
A lot of people died here.

24:26.971 --> 24:30.139
- Bad, bad people.
- That is not a ghost.

24:30.141 --> 24:33.212
That's some nut who also has
control over all the doors.

24:35.380 --> 24:36.813
'Where is that coming from?'

24:36.815 --> 24:38.381
Maybe it's someone who can help us.

24:38.383 --> 24:40.149
Can you hear us?

24:40.151 --> 24:42.084
'The rules have changed.'

24:42.086 --> 24:44.288
Not sounding super helpful.

24:44.290 --> 24:46.023
We're locked in the holding room.

24:46.025 --> 24:49.025
- Please, let us out.
- What do you want from us?

24:49.027 --> 24:52.094
Where is she? Where is Miss Presley?

24:52.096 --> 24:54.363
'I am your new principal.'

25:02.274 --> 25:04.875
What are we supposed to do?

25:04.877 --> 25:06.475
I think we're supposed to bounce.

25:06.477 --> 25:08.544
Yeah, and get full-scale Presleyed.

25:08.546 --> 25:10.214
Well, we can't stay here.

25:22.594 --> 25:24.962
She's not there.

25:24.964 --> 25:26.499
Uh, let's go.

25:38.444 --> 25:41.014
- Uh, this is not okay.
- Ugh.

25:59.063 --> 26:00.630
Eww.

26:00.632 --> 26:03.399
Okay, what's the plan?

26:03.401 --> 26:06.302
Presley obviously went that way.

26:06.304 --> 26:08.237
And that's where our cell phones are.

26:08.239 --> 26:10.173
Huh? Oh, hell, no.

26:10.175 --> 26:12.408
I am not going down the trail of smears.

26:12.410 --> 26:14.110
Unh-unh.

26:16.681 --> 26:19.182
- Maybe I am.
- Uh-huh.

26:19.184 --> 26:20.550
- Great.
- Come on.

26:20.552 --> 26:23.219
What?

26:23.221 --> 26:26.555
What if the killer's in there
waiting with a blowtorch?

26:26.557 --> 26:29.126
Don't worry, baby.

26:29.128 --> 26:31.028
Mama's got it covered.

26:31.030 --> 26:32.361
Huh.

27:09.334 --> 27:11.400
Okay.

27:11.402 --> 27:13.405
We gotta find the cell phones.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.611
Eww.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.216
Uh-huh.

27:34.059 --> 27:35.257
What?

27:35.259 --> 27:37.429
What do we do now?

27:40.365 --> 27:42.631
We find a way out.

27:42.633 --> 27:44.336
Duh, Jessica.

28:02.021 --> 28:04.457
This place is totally haunted.

28:06.257 --> 28:08.358
<i>Ghost</i> is out for blood.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.494
Don't be ridiculous.

28:10.496 --> 28:12.631
There is no such thing as ghosts.

28:14.432 --> 28:16.433
"When they saw him walk across the lake

28:16.435 --> 28:17.734
"they were terrified.

28:17.736 --> 28:19.369
"'It's a ghost, ' they cried.

28:19.371 --> 28:21.670
"But Jesus immediately said

28:21.672 --> 28:25.141
"'Take courage for it is I.

28:25.143 --> 28:27.279
Do not be afraid.'"

28:28.246 --> 28:30.613
There is a ghost.

28:30.615 --> 28:34.551
The forgotten prisoner of Way View Prison.

28:34.553 --> 28:37.587
This place used to be a prison

28:37.589 --> 28:40.823
for the criminally insane.

28:40.825 --> 28:43.392
I looked it up when I, uh, found out

28:43.394 --> 28:45.497
we were having detention here.

28:47.065 --> 28:49.599
When they closed this place

28:49.601 --> 28:53.403
one prisoner got left behind.

28:53.405 --> 28:58.407
She was locked in solitary confinement.

28:58.409 --> 29:04.513
They found her cold,
lifeless body weeks later.

29:04.515 --> 29:07.783
They say she is still here

29:07.785 --> 29:11.189
haunting the halls.

29:14.459 --> 29:18.395
Thanks for creeping me
out even more, freak show.

29:18.397 --> 29:22.432
Guys, there is no such thing as ghosts.

29:22.434 --> 29:25.401
You're right. It's not a ghost.

29:25.403 --> 29:26.703
It's Presley.

29:26.705 --> 29:29.406
Did you see the blood mile back there?

29:29.408 --> 29:31.308
- Fake.
- Presley's dead.

29:31.310 --> 29:33.310
She's messing with us.

29:33.312 --> 29:35.111
She's a total wack job.

29:35.113 --> 29:37.313
'This is just the kind
of sick, twisted crap'

29:37.315 --> 29:40.216
that hag would pull to try to freak us out.

29:40.218 --> 29:43.188
You might have a point, Lexi.

29:44.823 --> 29:46.626
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

29:49.561 --> 29:51.861
I do have a point.

30:22.928 --> 30:24.160
'Damn it.'

30:24.162 --> 30:26.164
I don't think that's gonna work.

30:27.666 --> 30:29.802
They can't all be locked.

30:40.478 --> 30:41.811
One of them has to be the way out.

30:41.813 --> 30:43.245
It's closed.

30:47.285 --> 30:50.253
I got assurances to go in there.

30:50.255 --> 30:52.291
Maybe this is the way.

30:55.259 --> 30:56.895
After you.

31:06.338 --> 31:07.436
Maybe..

31:14.545 --> 31:17.682
Okay, this feels like a setup.
Let's just call her bluff.

31:40.738 --> 31:43.773
Jesus. Will you put that thing away?

31:43.775 --> 31:45.844
You nearly stabbed me.

31:49.781 --> 31:53.252
'Who's going to make it to the
end of the deadly detention?'

31:54.753 --> 31:57.920
Okay, Presley, very funny.

31:57.922 --> 32:00.590
We know it's you.

32:00.592 --> 32:03.728
So come out, come out wherever you are.

32:22.913 --> 32:27.485
When I say Marco, you say Polo, biatch.

32:29.321 --> 32:30.954
Marco.

32:30.956 --> 32:32.388
'Polo.'

32:36.061 --> 32:38.331
- Taylor.
- Jesus.

32:40.732 --> 32:43.836
She is in here. We just have to find her.

32:55.313 --> 32:56.913
Okay.

32:56.915 --> 33:00.617
Principal Presley, you got us.

33:00.619 --> 33:02.651
'You totally did.'

33:02.653 --> 33:04.587
You know, if you could just come out

33:04.589 --> 33:07.456
we promise we'll be good
kids and we'll sit down

33:07.458 --> 33:10.659
and finish our essays
and, and we solemnly swear

33:10.661 --> 33:14.763
we will never do anything
bad ever again, okay?

33:14.765 --> 33:17.469
'Just, just come out.'

34:27.905 --> 34:31.043
Holy crap. We have to help Presley.

34:47.123 --> 34:48.524
I didn't mean to call her a bitch.

34:48.525 --> 34:49.824
I mean, she's totally a bitch

34:49.827 --> 34:52.829
but, but now, she's dead.

34:52.831 --> 34:54.830
Isn't she?

34:54.831 --> 34:57.065
I don't know. I don't feel a pulse.

34:57.068 --> 34:59.436
You're doing it wrong. You
have to do it at the neck.

34:59.438 --> 35:01.905
No, I think the left wrist will be
better if you just go from the left wrist.

35:01.907 --> 35:04.441
- 'Are you sure?'
- 'I don't know. I saw a docu...'

35:04.443 --> 35:06.508
- 'No, I'm pretty sure.'
- '...the neck, the left neck...'

35:06.510 --> 35:08.144
Do any of you two doctors
wanna get down here

35:08.146 --> 35:10.180
and do this yourself?

35:10.182 --> 35:11.780
- You?
- Um..

35:11.782 --> 35:13.550
- Nah, I'm cool. I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

35:13.552 --> 35:14.917
Check to see if she has a Fitbit.

35:14.919 --> 35:16.619
All old people wear Fitbits.

35:16.621 --> 35:17.887
It tells you if there's a pulse

35:17.889 --> 35:19.588
and how many calories you've burned.

35:19.590 --> 35:20.957
Check it!

35:20.959 --> 35:22.992
'Attention, students.'

35:22.994 --> 35:25.160
'Please step away from the body.'

35:25.162 --> 35:27.162
So much for Presley pranking us.

35:27.164 --> 35:28.933
We gotta go.

35:47.218 --> 35:50.153
Guys, wait, wait, wait.

35:50.155 --> 35:53.523
This isn't right. Someone
should say something.

35:58.063 --> 36:00.930
- Me?
- You knew her best.

36:00.932 --> 36:04.533
Since when does being
most likely to get expelled

36:04.535 --> 36:07.736
qualify you to eulogize your
dead bludgeoned principal

36:07.738 --> 36:09.905
in the middle of a freaking meat locker.

36:09.907 --> 36:11.774
The Lord will guide
you. Come on, I got you.

36:11.776 --> 36:14.276
Fine. Whatever.

36:14.278 --> 36:16.512
Oh, wait.

36:16.514 --> 36:17.849
Thanks.

36:23.822 --> 36:25.053
Okay, here's the thing.

36:25.055 --> 36:26.789
Presley was a piece of crotch rot.

36:26.791 --> 36:28.557
I freakin' hated her.

36:28.559 --> 36:30.959
And standing over her dead

36:30.961 --> 36:34.796
twisted, waste of a middle-aged body

36:34.798 --> 36:37.700
has been my soft, wet fantasy

36:37.702 --> 36:40.937
for the last three and a half years.

36:40.939 --> 36:43.305
But I didn't know it would be so gross

36:43.307 --> 36:45.742
so I am sorry for that.

36:45.744 --> 36:47.744
Mostly because I think
I'm gonna puke right now.

36:47.746 --> 36:49.581
Amen!

36:50.749 --> 36:52.180
Ugh.

36:59.189 --> 37:01.823
Look at you, bein' all nice.

37:01.825 --> 37:04.294
What? I just, I don't want her to come back

37:04.296 --> 37:07.129
and haunt me for that trophy.

37:07.131 --> 37:10.099
You know, it's okay if you liked her.

37:35.860 --> 37:37.327
Which way now, Pocahontas?

37:37.329 --> 37:39.595
Um, I think you mean Sacagawea.

37:39.597 --> 37:40.829
Pocahontas wasn't a guy.

37:40.831 --> 37:41.965
She was actually more of a, uh..

37:43.635 --> 37:46.369
Well, answers that.

37:46.371 --> 37:49.271
Yeah, right, and fall right into that trap?

37:49.273 --> 37:51.673
No, <i>gracias,</i> I'll find my own way.

37:51.675 --> 37:53.876
Wait.

37:53.878 --> 37:56.144
What? It's not a door to Narnia, honey.

37:56.146 --> 37:58.780
I know, it's just..

37:58.782 --> 38:01.085
There's something not
right about that door.

38:06.890 --> 38:10.296
Oh! Oh! I hate you so hard right now.

38:12.697 --> 38:14.896
- Punk'd! Ah!
- Douche.

38:14.898 --> 38:17.867
I'm just.. Really?

38:17.869 --> 38:19.267
I'm just tryin' to lighten up the mood.

38:19.269 --> 38:21.039
Ugh!

38:24.108 --> 38:26.644
'It's even less funny the
second time, Barrett. Let's go.'

38:28.012 --> 38:29.412
Oh, shit!

38:29.414 --> 38:31.013
- Holy shit!
- No, don't touch him!

38:31.015 --> 38:33.282
Don't touch him! You're
gonna shock yourself!

38:33.284 --> 38:35.621
Barrett. No! Oh!

38:38.322 --> 38:40.722
- Barrett.
- Okay. We have to find a spoon.

38:40.724 --> 38:43.358
We have to put it in his mouth so
he doesn't bite down on his tongue.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.292
That's for seizures.

38:44.294 --> 38:47.030
Slap his face or something.

38:47.032 --> 38:48.830
Barrett, come on.

38:48.832 --> 38:50.767
- Kiss him.
- That's fairytales.

38:50.769 --> 38:53.702
Really, guys? You need to bone
up on your basic first aid.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.738
It's a reflex. If she kisses him

38:55.740 --> 38:56.838
then he might kiss her back.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.441
You do it then.

38:59.443 --> 39:01.244
Okay.

39:22.267 --> 39:25.968
Oh, yeah, he's really comin' around.

39:27.338 --> 39:30.042
Okay. He's alive.

39:31.209 --> 39:33.975
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:33.977 --> 39:37.182
- What happened?
- You got shocked by that door.

39:38.950 --> 39:41.283
Oh.

39:41.285 --> 39:44.322
- Thanks for reviving me.
- My pleasure.

39:45.356 --> 39:48.026
Alright, upsy-daisy.

39:51.296 --> 39:53.262
Great, I smell like barbeque.

39:53.264 --> 39:55.800
Well, you don't taste like it.

39:57.968 --> 39:59.202
Alright, break it up.

39:59.204 --> 40:02.037
We are in imminent danger, people.

40:02.039 --> 40:03.405
'Think it's safe to assume'

40:03.407 --> 40:05.408
all the wrong doors are booby-trapped.

40:05.410 --> 40:07.477
Yeah, duh. 'Cause the forgotten prisoner

40:07.479 --> 40:09.982
wants us to follow her evil map.

40:11.816 --> 40:13.483
It is not the forgotten prisoner.

40:13.485 --> 40:15.984
Okay, then what the hell is it?

40:15.986 --> 40:19.488
'No one leaves till detention is over.'

40:19.490 --> 40:21.524
Show yourself, you fucking coward.

40:21.526 --> 40:23.358
That's great. Question his moral character.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.760
Ghosts really like that.

40:24.762 --> 40:25.995
It is not a ghost.

40:25.997 --> 40:27.863
It is a ghost.

40:27.865 --> 40:30.133
I'm kind of leaning towards ghost too.

40:30.135 --> 40:31.901
I don't care if it's a ghost.

40:31.903 --> 40:33.468
I just wanna get away from you freaks.

40:33.470 --> 40:35.403
Hey, come on. Now..

40:35.405 --> 40:38.240
No, bring it in. Bring it in, guys.

40:38.242 --> 40:41.176
Get in here. Break.. It's
called a huddle. Bring it in.

40:41.178 --> 40:43.812
Uh, go around me. Come on.

40:43.814 --> 40:45.847
Oh, alright. No.

40:45.849 --> 40:48.151
No.

40:48.153 --> 40:49.885
Okay.

40:49.887 --> 40:52.988
Listen, whatever this

40:52.990 --> 40:56.992
this thing is, we have to ignore it

40:56.994 --> 40:59.461
and just keep trying to find a way out.

40:59.463 --> 41:01.329
It is just trying to scare us

41:01.331 --> 41:03.800
and we can't let it get the best of us.

41:03.802 --> 41:06.535
The more you allow it to freak you out

41:06.537 --> 41:11.073
the less focus you will have
to do what you need to do

41:11.075 --> 41:13.475
to survive, to win.

41:13.477 --> 41:16.945
'I can hear you.'

41:16.947 --> 41:20.316
There are no other options.

41:20.318 --> 41:22.984
Keep your eyes on the prize.

41:22.986 --> 41:25.254
We get out there on that field

41:25.256 --> 41:29.358
and we run that ball, and we are gonna win.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.359
That's what we're gonna
do. We're gonna win.

41:31.361 --> 41:33.129
Ready? On nine.

41:33.131 --> 41:37.265
Ready? One, two, three

41:37.267 --> 41:40.570
four, five..

41:40.572 --> 41:41.903
Whatever, guys.

41:41.905 --> 41:44.573
Six, seven. This is..

41:44.575 --> 41:46.441
Eight, nine!

41:46.443 --> 41:49.278
Alright! Be the best.

41:49.280 --> 41:52.117
Alright..

41:53.184 --> 41:54.486
Uh..

41:56.220 --> 41:59.988
Barrett, lead pipe in the kitchen, huh?

41:59.990 --> 42:02.524
Hmm. Yeah, this is yours. Let's go.

42:02.526 --> 42:04.396
Alright, um.. Oh.

42:06.430 --> 42:08.164
Sharp and pointy, Lexi.

42:08.166 --> 42:09.398
Sounds just like you.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.234
Alright, and ooh.

42:12.236 --> 42:15.173
I've got a stake. Let's go, bitches.

42:22.914 --> 42:25.513
So, uh, how did you get detention?

42:25.515 --> 42:29.017
You don't seem like a rule breaker.

42:29.019 --> 42:32.088
Graffiti on the gym wall.

42:32.090 --> 42:35.124
Wait, that was you that
put Jesus ate my homework

42:35.126 --> 42:37.292
in pink and gold sparkle in the gym?

42:37.294 --> 42:40.129
What do you think? No.

42:40.131 --> 42:42.465
Jesus would have turned in my homework.

42:42.467 --> 42:44.302
'Wait, what?'

42:46.371 --> 42:49.171
- You didn't do it?
- No.

42:49.173 --> 42:51.307
'Everyone just assumed it was me.'

42:51.309 --> 42:53.675
Plus, they found the spray paint
and the glitter in my locker.

42:53.677 --> 42:56.945
- Wait. That wasn't yours?
- No.

42:56.947 --> 42:59.481
Well, at least not the spray paint.

42:59.483 --> 43:01.149
Besides, I will not waste my glitter

43:01.151 --> 43:02.919
on a high school gym wall, okay, girl?

43:02.921 --> 43:05.387
- Yeah.
- Same happened to me.

43:05.389 --> 43:07.957
Oh, they found your glitter stash too?

43:07.959 --> 43:09.925
Cute, but no.

43:09.927 --> 43:13.361
They found a bottle of vodka
in my locker in a locker sweep.

43:13.363 --> 43:15.231
Only it wasn't mine.
It wasn't even my brand.

43:15.233 --> 43:19.135
I wanna know what Miss
MVP did to get detention.

43:19.137 --> 43:20.635
One day, the volleyball nets were slashed

43:20.637 --> 43:22.470
and someone said I was the last one

43:22.472 --> 43:24.372
leaving the gym the night before.

43:24.374 --> 43:27.246
I would never damage school property.

43:29.247 --> 43:31.180
'That sucks.'

43:31.182 --> 43:34.350
Hey, you're in detention
too. What did you do?

43:34.352 --> 43:38.086
Someone called me a tranny,
and I punched her in the face.

43:38.088 --> 43:40.157
So you were framed too, huh?

43:41.159 --> 43:43.494
No. I punched her.

43:46.430 --> 43:48.432
'Come on, guys.'

43:58.709 --> 44:00.142
What's that smell?

44:00.144 --> 44:03.178
The funk of 40,000 years.

44:03.180 --> 44:05.680
Be careful. It's dark and slippery in here.

44:05.682 --> 44:08.017
- That's what she said.
- Shut up, Barrett.

44:08.019 --> 44:11.287
Um, did you Google Maps
the spookiest path available

44:11.289 --> 44:13.655
or was this an accident? I'm confused.

44:13.657 --> 44:17.526
I just felt what my senses
told me was the right way.

44:17.528 --> 44:21.262
Great. Now jock girl has spidey senses.

44:21.264 --> 44:22.698
You wanna lead?

44:22.700 --> 44:25.300
You guys, nobody asked
me if I wanted to lead.

44:25.302 --> 44:27.202
- Do you?
- No.

44:27.204 --> 44:29.070
Wait. Did you hear that?

44:32.309 --> 44:36.012
- 'Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!'
- 'Come on!'

44:40.684 --> 44:42.987
Oh, my God! Ah. Ah.

44:47.758 --> 44:50.291
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go!

44:50.293 --> 44:52.128
- Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

44:52.130 --> 44:54.562
- Get in, get in!
- Shut it!

44:54.564 --> 44:56.164
Oh, my God.

44:56.166 --> 44:58.767
I told you guys, there is a ghost.

45:03.807 --> 45:07.075
What is that? Oh, my God! What is that?

45:07.077 --> 45:08.544
It's gas!

45:12.416 --> 45:14.185
- 'Kevin!'
- God.

45:16.253 --> 45:18.421
Guys, it's gas. Cover your mouth.

45:20.590 --> 45:23.094
- Kevin, I need your jacket.
- Here, here, here, here!

45:27.398 --> 45:29.798
- 'What are you doing?'
- My hat! My hat!

45:29.800 --> 45:32.103
- 'Taylor!'
- Wait, let me help you!

45:33.838 --> 45:35.738
Barrett.

45:35.740 --> 45:37.640
Come on, I need it. Come on!

45:38.742 --> 45:41.744
- 'Ah!'
- Go, go, go!

45:41.746 --> 45:43.682
You follow me.

45:45.816 --> 45:47.082
'Come on!'

45:49.720 --> 45:52.024
'Taylor, come on!'

45:59.597 --> 46:02.263
Stay on the poles, guys. The
tiles can't hold our weight.

46:02.265 --> 46:04.302
'Go. Go.'

46:14.211 --> 46:16.479
Oh, shit.

46:16.481 --> 46:18.650
'Yo. Wait, wait, girl.'

46:21.718 --> 46:24.253
I was just sayin', like, if
you wanna attract the ladies

46:24.255 --> 46:26.421
you should dress more sexy, you know.

46:26.423 --> 46:28.791
Get better pants or somethin'.

46:28.793 --> 46:30.695
Shut up, Barrett.

46:32.195 --> 46:33.662
'I'm just trying to help.'

46:33.664 --> 46:35.631
What's wrong? Are you stuck?

46:35.633 --> 46:39.200
I'm fine. Uh, just go.

46:39.202 --> 46:41.238
Okay. Ooh.

46:59.456 --> 47:00.624
Go.

47:05.563 --> 47:07.164
Whoa.

47:14.572 --> 47:16.740
No, no, Kevin!

47:43.434 --> 47:44.870
Ah.

47:55.713 --> 47:57.213
Hey.

47:57.215 --> 47:59.881
Hey, Jessica, you okay?

47:59.883 --> 48:01.584
Hm.

48:01.586 --> 48:04.787
Where is Taylor? Did she make it?

48:18.369 --> 48:19.968
Barrett?

48:19.970 --> 48:22.905
- Barrett, are you okay?
- Hm?

48:22.907 --> 48:25.608
Hmm.

48:25.610 --> 48:27.977
- Oh.
- What the hell happened?

48:30.648 --> 48:32.383
We fell.

48:35.485 --> 48:37.588
- Oh.
- Where is everybody?

48:38.822 --> 48:39.954
I don't know.

48:41.691 --> 48:42.791
What's wrong? Are you okay?

48:44.294 --> 48:45.995
I think I just fractured my coccyx.

48:47.965 --> 48:49.465
- Oh.
- Stupid.

48:49.467 --> 48:51.966
'You okay? Oh.'

48:51.968 --> 48:54.773
'Oh, where is Taylor? Did she make it?'

48:58.041 --> 49:00.244
I don't think so.

49:01.012 --> 49:03.912
Where's Lexi and Barrett?

49:03.914 --> 49:05.650
I don't know.

49:08.418 --> 49:10.551
- Ow.
- Oh, man.

49:16.059 --> 49:18.295
I'm sorry. You okay?

49:20.030 --> 49:21.632
Oh.

49:29.740 --> 49:32.908
Oh, my ankle.

49:32.910 --> 49:35.380
I think I landed wrong in the fall.

49:37.014 --> 49:39.548
Oh.

49:39.550 --> 49:41.483
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

49:41.485 --> 49:42.984
I think it's just sprained.

49:42.986 --> 49:45.019
I'll be okay. Thanks.

50:15.785 --> 50:17.454
Shit.

50:27.465 --> 50:30.832
- Ow.
- Okay, what's this?

50:30.834 --> 50:33.936
Ah. Where have you been
hiding this the whole time?

50:35.673 --> 50:37.776
Got it from my dad last night.

50:39.043 --> 50:41.512
- Sharing is caring.
- Yep.

50:44.381 --> 50:45.747
Yo.

50:45.749 --> 50:47.515
Can I have some?

50:49.887 --> 50:51.756
Be my guest.

50:53.157 --> 50:54.793
Ow.

50:58.796 --> 51:00.799
Do you think it will hurt?

51:02.099 --> 51:03.601
Dying.

51:04.769 --> 51:06.471
Um, maybe.

51:09.572 --> 51:11.575
Got any last wishes?

51:14.512 --> 51:17.579
To be really wasted when it happens.

51:17.581 --> 51:18.783
Yeah.

51:24.588 --> 51:27.088
It's fucking creepy in here.

51:27.090 --> 51:28.559
Here.

51:53.818 --> 51:55.820
Got any last wishes?

51:58.088 --> 52:00.124
I just wanna be happy.

52:01.124 --> 52:02.626
Don't you?

52:04.794 --> 52:06.097
I guess.

52:08.064 --> 52:10.501
What have you got to be unhappy about?

52:11.535 --> 52:13.138
You have everything.

52:16.173 --> 52:18.410
I guess, yeah.

52:20.244 --> 52:22.713
I'm loaded, hot.

52:25.849 --> 52:28.550
Everybody loves me. Ow.

52:34.090 --> 52:35.793
Come on, Kev.

52:37.193 --> 52:39.563
You gotta use it. We gotta go.

52:40.631 --> 52:42.667
Okay, okay, okay. Ugh.

52:44.968 --> 52:47.539
It's like all that stupid
shit they say on "Oprah."

52:48.939 --> 52:50.972
Ow.

52:52.610 --> 52:55.780
You haven't been looking
in the right cookie jars.

53:00.150 --> 53:02.486
You can't screw your way to nirvana either.

53:07.291 --> 53:10.562
Maybe not, but it sure is worth a try.

53:24.909 --> 53:27.579
- Be careful, it's slippery.
- Yeah, I got it.

53:31.782 --> 53:34.550
- How you doing, man?
- I'm okay, okay. You go on.

53:34.552 --> 53:36.053
Don't stop.

54:11.789 --> 54:14.124
Wait! Might be booby-trapped.

54:15.793 --> 54:17.792
You, you wanna get out of here, right?

54:17.794 --> 54:19.530
Yeah.

54:22.198 --> 54:24.999
Be the best.

54:25.001 --> 54:28.003
Yes!

54:28.005 --> 54:30.008
- 'Come on.'
- Damn, girl.

54:38.115 --> 54:40.782
No! Dead end.

54:40.784 --> 54:42.153
Shit.

54:49.325 --> 54:51.061
Oh, no!

55:02.773 --> 55:04.905
What is that thing?

55:07.677 --> 55:09.680
Don't worry about it.

55:14.184 --> 55:17.285
- You're scared?
- Yeah.

55:17.287 --> 55:20.756
No. No, I don't get scared.

55:20.758 --> 55:22.189
It's weak.

55:22.191 --> 55:24.329
- It's human.
- Same thing.

55:28.032 --> 55:30.798
How could I be so stupid?

55:30.800 --> 55:33.068
I walked us into a dead end!

55:33.070 --> 55:34.805
Ow!

55:36.305 --> 55:38.407
Alright, come here.

55:38.409 --> 55:41.242
Come here, come here.

55:41.244 --> 55:42.880
Let me see.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.990
Really?

55:54.858 --> 55:57.091
Look, you got a little crazy on you, honey.

55:57.093 --> 55:59.126
Don't worry, I got it.

55:59.128 --> 56:01.296
Just leave it.

56:01.298 --> 56:03.868
We're gonna die in five minutes, anyway.

56:06.936 --> 56:10.273
So that's it. You just, just giving up?

56:12.242 --> 56:15.046
You see any chance of us
getting out of here alive?

56:16.780 --> 56:18.249
Well, no.

56:20.784 --> 56:22.854
But I still have hope.

56:26.090 --> 56:27.858
Crap.

56:29.159 --> 56:32.193
I don't cry either.

56:32.195 --> 56:34.162
Well, look at you.

56:34.164 --> 56:36.330
You're havin' all kinds
of new experiences today

56:36.332 --> 56:38.101
sports robot.

56:41.438 --> 56:43.740
'I can't die yet.'

56:46.110 --> 56:47.943
And what makes you so special?

56:47.945 --> 56:50.314
'I haven't made him proud yet.'

56:52.349 --> 56:54.352
You haven't made who proud of you yet?

56:55.785 --> 56:57.320
My dad.

56:58.956 --> 57:00.158
Ah.

57:02.059 --> 57:06.064
So is, is that what all this
be-the-best crap is about?

57:11.068 --> 57:12.767
Okay, look.

57:14.872 --> 57:16.303
I'm assuming

57:16.305 --> 57:20.307
that back at that rabid
possum-infested dump

57:20.309 --> 57:22.878
we call high school

57:22.880 --> 57:25.981
is a beautiful glass-front trophy case

57:25.983 --> 57:28.883
filled with all the little awards

57:28.885 --> 57:32.456
that sporting sportsters
just like yourself win, right?

57:34.057 --> 57:36.358
I'm looking for a response here, honey.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.559
Yeah.

57:38.561 --> 57:41.229
And it's also safe to assume

57:41.231 --> 57:46.001
that more than a few of
those shiny little chalices

57:46.003 --> 57:48.405
and medals have your name on them.

57:52.108 --> 57:54.408
Right?

57:54.410 --> 57:56.914
And who wins the awards?

58:00.117 --> 58:03.117
- The best.
- I can't hear you.

58:03.119 --> 58:05.253
- The best.
- You better testify!

58:05.255 --> 58:07.023
The best.

58:09.293 --> 58:12.028
Listen, you've already been the best.

58:13.597 --> 58:16.865
And you don't have to prove it to anyone

58:16.867 --> 58:18.535
but yourself now.

58:21.371 --> 58:22.874
Okay?

58:25.441 --> 58:27.110
Thank you.

58:28.044 --> 58:29.380
Of course.

58:44.461 --> 58:46.531
You wanna do it again?

58:48.197 --> 58:50.332
Hashtag YOLO.

59:27.371 --> 59:29.539
- How's your ankle?
- I'm okay.

59:41.684 --> 59:44.385
'Come on, we gotta hurry.'

59:44.387 --> 59:46.320
Believe me, I'm trying.

59:46.322 --> 59:48.325
We gotta run. Come on.

01:00:07.577 --> 01:00:09.146
Kevin!

01:00:11.414 --> 01:00:12.949
Kevin!

01:00:15.017 --> 01:00:16.684
Kevin!

01:00:16.686 --> 01:00:18.889
Where did you go?

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:21.492
Kevin!

01:00:25.195 --> 01:00:26.597
Kev!

01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:42.410
Oh! You're so freakin' hot.

01:00:42.412 --> 01:00:43.979
You're so freakin' hot.

01:00:43.981 --> 01:00:45.650
Ah! Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:01.465
Guys!

01:01:09.405 --> 01:01:10.974
Hello?

01:01:13.477 --> 01:01:15.046
Barrett!

01:01:43.439 --> 01:01:45.342
'Lexi!'

01:01:48.412 --> 01:01:50.081
Anybody!

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:55.118
Hello?

01:01:57.253 --> 01:01:58.488
'Barrett!'

01:02:00.356 --> 01:02:01.592
'Guys!'

01:02:03.526 --> 01:02:05.229
You're alive.

01:02:07.329 --> 01:02:09.733
Oh, I thought I was the only one left.

01:02:12.535 --> 01:02:14.501
Where's Kevin?

01:02:14.503 --> 01:02:17.674
One second he was with
me and next he was gone.

01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:22.644
- Barrett, what is on your face?
- What?

01:02:22.646 --> 01:02:24.312
- Wait, get it off.
- Oh!

01:02:24.314 --> 01:02:26.747
You're so freaking pretty.
It's just lipstick, Barrett.

01:02:26.749 --> 01:02:29.117
Dude, be specific, okay?

01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:30.852
We're in a shit storm right now.

01:02:30.854 --> 01:02:33.457
'Please return to the holding area.'

01:02:36.226 --> 01:02:38.626
I cannot believe I'm going to die

01:02:38.628 --> 01:02:42.396
and the two of you are the
last people I'll ever see.

01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:44.332
'Way to bring us down, Jessica.'

01:02:44.334 --> 01:02:47.501
Yeah. Way to bring us down, Jessica.

01:02:47.503 --> 01:02:50.504
It is all your fault.

01:02:50.506 --> 01:02:51.773
What are you talking about?

01:02:51.775 --> 01:02:54.575
Do you even care that Kevin's dead?

01:02:54.577 --> 01:02:57.579
You just ran off to bump uglies or whatever

01:02:57.581 --> 01:02:59.881
instead of trying to find a way out.

01:02:59.883 --> 01:03:03.184
And if just for one second
you had thought about anything

01:03:03.186 --> 01:03:05.189
other than getting off..

01:03:06.555 --> 01:03:08.722
...he would still be here.

01:03:08.724 --> 01:03:12.126
At least Kevin was halfway interesting.

01:03:12.128 --> 01:03:13.695
As far as I can tell,
you're just the champion

01:03:13.697 --> 01:03:16.330
of whiny and bossy.

01:03:16.332 --> 01:03:18.265
It's not that I don't care, Jessica.

01:03:18.267 --> 01:03:20.434
I'm just sorry it wasn't you.

01:03:20.436 --> 01:03:21.769
Excru...

01:03:21.771 --> 01:03:24.108
- Shut up, Barrett.
- Shut up, Barrett.

01:03:25.675 --> 01:03:28.376
Listen up, proud Mary.

01:03:28.378 --> 01:03:31.479
I don't make excuses for
the way I live my life.

01:03:31.481 --> 01:03:33.548
But I live it.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.885
And if I am gonna kick it
in this janky-ass prison

01:03:36.887 --> 01:03:38.620
where the smell of piss and desperation

01:03:38.622 --> 01:03:40.454
are making my eyes water

01:03:40.456 --> 01:03:42.689
then the last words out of my smiling lips

01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:46.660
are going to be "no regrets."

01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:48.765
Can you say the same thing?

01:03:50.467 --> 01:03:53.734
I'm just going to assume this crazy

01:03:53.736 --> 01:03:55.436
is the syphilis talking.

01:03:55.438 --> 01:03:57.872
- What? You have syphilis?
- No, Barrett.

01:03:57.874 --> 01:04:00.374
Don't go setting your
wiener on fire yet, okay?

01:04:00.376 --> 01:04:01.843
Look, what is bugging you?

01:04:01.845 --> 01:04:03.945
I feel like neither of you are trying.

01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:05.812
Is there a way that I'm supposed to act

01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:08.883
when we are being stalked
by a faceless killer?

01:04:08.885 --> 01:04:10.852
'Please return to the holding area.'

01:04:10.854 --> 01:04:13.256
- Oh.
- Shut up, we get it!

01:04:15.457 --> 01:04:16.957
Have you guys noticed
there aren't any mirrors

01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:18.892
in this place?

01:04:18.894 --> 01:04:21.629
Are you kidding me?

01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:23.698
I mean, I guess certainly criminals

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.566
don't care what they look like.

01:04:25.568 --> 01:04:28.803
Impending doom awaits
us around every corner

01:04:28.805 --> 01:04:31.606
and all Barrett wants is a facial.

01:04:31.608 --> 01:04:34.776
Look, if I'm gonna die today,
I still wanna go out hot.

01:04:34.778 --> 01:04:38.278
How can you joke about that right now?

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.349
I don't want to die.

01:04:41.351 --> 01:04:43.283
I don't wanna joke about dying.

01:04:43.285 --> 01:04:44.519
Why are you getting pissed at me?

01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:45.954
Because, Barrett

01:04:45.956 --> 01:04:48.722
because you're a such a piece of nothing.

01:04:48.724 --> 01:04:51.291
You're like a waste of beautiful space.

01:04:51.293 --> 01:04:52.459
Shut up, Jessica.

01:04:52.461 --> 01:04:53.695
Your biggest fear

01:04:53.697 --> 01:04:54.963
is running out of hair gel.

01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:56.330
I said shut up.

01:04:56.332 --> 01:04:58.233
Not getting enough likes on Instagram.

01:04:58.235 --> 01:05:00.767
Hey, I said shut up, okay?

01:05:00.769 --> 01:05:02.970
Stop hating.

01:05:02.972 --> 01:05:05.807
We all live in our little bubbles, right?

01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:09.244
You're the athlete. Kevin
was all nerdy for Jesus.

01:05:09.246 --> 01:05:12.582
I don't know what Taylor was,
but maybe that was her thing.

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:15.785
You're a slut.

01:05:19.655 --> 01:05:21.455
Come on, Lexi.

01:05:21.457 --> 01:05:24.024
You talk like it. You dress like it.

01:05:24.026 --> 01:05:25.959
I, in fact, have personal experience

01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:28.331
to back this observation up.

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:34.301
Look, somewhere along the
way, we all picked the part

01:05:34.303 --> 01:05:36.671
and now we play them, okay?

01:05:36.673 --> 01:05:38.809
Don't get pissed at me for picking popular.

01:05:40.343 --> 01:05:43.443
I'm not you, Barrett.

01:05:43.445 --> 01:05:45.848
Yeah, but deep down, you kinda wanna be.

01:05:48.952 --> 01:05:50.955
You're a total jerk.

01:05:56.626 --> 01:05:58.229
Whatever.

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:05.768
I don't know why he's such a dick.

01:06:15.611 --> 01:06:18.749
Haters gonna hate, but
Barrett's always great.

01:06:22.519 --> 01:06:26.854
Jessica, look, I'm sorry, okay?

01:06:26.856 --> 01:06:29.959
I didn't, I mean, I've always been a dick.

01:06:31.695 --> 01:06:35.599
So at least I'm honest, right?

01:06:36.633 --> 01:06:38.966
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.773
Barrett.

01:06:49.945 --> 01:06:52.315
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Barrett.

01:06:57.787 --> 01:06:59.290
Oh, my God.

01:07:00.423 --> 01:07:02.493
Oh, my God. His face.

01:07:04.994 --> 01:07:07.695
We shouldn't have left him.

01:07:07.697 --> 01:07:10.934
Barrett, I'm so sorry.

01:07:15.372 --> 01:07:18.004
He just wanted to die hot.

01:07:18.006 --> 01:07:20.742
'And he looks awful.'

01:07:20.744 --> 01:07:23.811
Oh, he's gonna be so pissed.

01:07:23.813 --> 01:07:26.546
He's dead, Lexi.

01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:28.818
Ghost pissed, Jessica. I'm not stupid.

01:07:37.793 --> 01:07:40.797
We have to find out who's doing this to us.

01:07:42.798 --> 01:07:44.367
You're right.

01:07:48.003 --> 01:07:50.470
And when we find that asshole

01:07:50.472 --> 01:07:53.009
we're gonna fork him up.

01:07:57.579 --> 01:07:59.012
Damn right.

01:07:59.014 --> 01:08:01.149
What? Are you gonna flip
him over when he's done?

01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:02.450
Slap his face?

01:08:04.854 --> 01:08:06.457
- No.
- No.

01:08:09.559 --> 01:08:10.994
Alright.

01:08:43.759 --> 01:08:46.496
Be the best!

01:08:48.197 --> 01:08:51.096
Okay, that was good.

01:08:51.099 --> 01:08:54.001
Um, but a little less cheerleader.

01:08:54.002 --> 01:08:56.005
A little more assassin.

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:03.211
But I really, like, I felt
it was very powerful...

01:09:03.212 --> 01:09:04.782
'Come on.'

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:10.720
Eww, there's poop everywhere.

01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:38.014
Kevin.

01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:44.488
I'm gonna get you, asshole.

01:09:58.134 --> 01:10:00.735
This prison's only so big.

01:10:00.737 --> 01:10:03.303
The killer has to be here somewhere.

01:10:03.305 --> 01:10:07.941
'Attention, ladies,
this is your principal.'

01:10:07.943 --> 01:10:11.279
Where are you, Principal Chicken Shit?

01:10:19.789 --> 01:10:21.258
Stay close.

01:10:34.571 --> 01:10:38.605
'Congratulations. You
are the sole survivors.'

01:10:38.607 --> 01:10:41.575
What do we win? A plaque or a trophy?

01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:43.209
'Look out.'

01:11:21.683 --> 01:11:23.883
This is fun. Aren't we
having fun today, ladies?

01:11:23.885 --> 01:11:25.955
I know I sure I am.

01:11:56.219 --> 01:11:57.854
Look.

01:12:05.228 --> 01:12:08.361
Why is there a shrine of Jenny Duke?

01:12:08.363 --> 01:12:11.735
I don't know, but that's really weird.

01:12:42.698 --> 01:12:44.166
No! No.

01:12:49.104 --> 01:12:51.204
No.

01:12:51.206 --> 01:12:53.677
No, please, stop that..

01:13:07.356 --> 01:13:09.425
Oh, my hair! Oww!

01:13:43.392 --> 01:13:44.894
You.

01:13:47.028 --> 01:13:48.197
Urgh!

01:13:50.098 --> 01:13:52.800
Really? The hall cop.

01:13:52.802 --> 01:13:55.770
You find that amusing?

01:13:55.772 --> 01:14:01.041
No. I find that incredibly fuckin' lame.

01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:02.943
Shut your slutty little mouth.

01:14:02.945 --> 01:14:04.947
Suck me, hall cop.

01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:15.959
Hall cop.

01:14:19.262 --> 01:14:22.999
I'm just some invisible
nobody to you people.

01:14:25.134 --> 01:14:27.467
But I see things.

01:14:27.469 --> 01:14:30.171
I hear things. I know things.

01:14:30.173 --> 01:14:34.874
And, young lady, I have got the power now.

01:14:34.876 --> 01:14:38.846
Oh, yeah. You're a real superhero.

01:14:38.848 --> 01:14:41.047
You know, I made all this happen.

01:14:41.049 --> 01:14:43.050
Did you know that?

01:14:43.052 --> 01:14:45.285
This is my impressed face.

01:14:45.287 --> 01:14:48.321
Do you know how hard it
is to sneak 50 opossums

01:14:48.323 --> 01:14:50.423
'into a public high school?'

01:14:50.425 --> 01:14:52.226
Opossum.

01:14:52.228 --> 01:14:54.531
It's pretty ingenious, you have to admit.

01:14:56.131 --> 01:14:58.899
'And that's just the tip of the iceberg.'

01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:02.238
It was me who made sure
you all got detention.

01:15:03.339 --> 01:15:06.006
Yeah. Leave a little clue here.

01:15:06.008 --> 01:15:09.109
Give information to the right people there.

01:15:09.111 --> 01:15:10.543
And it worked.

01:15:10.545 --> 01:15:12.413
And I would have gotten away with it too

01:15:12.415 --> 01:15:14.849
if it weren't for you meddling kids.

01:15:14.851 --> 01:15:19.285
I made sure all of you
narcissistic, hateful brats

01:15:19.287 --> 01:15:23.392
were under one roof with no
way out and no one else around.

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:30.567
Not a soul.

01:15:36.205 --> 01:15:37.506
Wanna see?

01:15:39.075 --> 01:15:40.544
Scream.

01:15:45.313 --> 01:15:49.084
Go ahead. Scream as loud as you can.

01:15:50.253 --> 01:15:52.953
Scream, slut.

01:15:52.955 --> 01:15:55.489
Jessica! Jessica, where are you?

01:15:55.491 --> 01:15:59.229
Jessica! Jessica, where are you?

01:16:06.335 --> 01:16:09.372
Man, I wish I brought
some popcorn to this show.

01:16:12.909 --> 01:16:14.510
She's gone, sweetie.

01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:18.514
She really lost her head.

01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.518
They're all gone.

01:16:26.022 --> 01:16:27.323
'And you're next.'

01:16:28.657 --> 01:16:31.324
Please, okay.

01:16:31.326 --> 01:16:34.528
Just, please, let me go.

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:36.129
'I won't tell anybody.'

01:16:36.131 --> 01:16:38.535
Please, just, please let me go, Mr..

01:16:41.704 --> 01:16:43.305
...Hall Cop.

01:16:44.706 --> 01:16:47.309
You don't know my name, do you?

01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:51.945
Officer Hall Cop?

01:16:51.947 --> 01:16:55.481
You see me every day
for the past four years

01:16:55.483 --> 01:16:57.987
and you don't even know my name?

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.195
I bet you didn't know I
have a daughter either.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.033
Had..

01:17:13.035 --> 01:17:14.470
...a daughter.

01:17:16.205 --> 01:17:18.241
You're Jenny's dad.

01:17:21.677 --> 01:17:25.011
She was beautiful.

01:17:25.013 --> 01:17:28.217
Smart as a whip and filled with dream.

01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:32.386
'She was gonna be an architect.'

01:17:32.388 --> 01:17:34.390
Unh, unh, unh.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.467
She made me laugh.

01:17:47.469 --> 01:17:50.104
I mean, dang, this girl

01:17:50.106 --> 01:17:52.375
knew how to tickle my funny bone.

01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:04.120
I can still hear her voice..

01:18:05.353 --> 01:18:07.423
...each night when I go to sleep.

01:18:10.593 --> 01:18:12.329
Goodnight, daddy.

01:18:14.095 --> 01:18:16.332
Sounded like a little bell ringing.

01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:20.970
And then she'd sing to me.

01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:26.209
♪ After you've gone ♪

01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:30.981
♪ After you've gone away ♪♪

01:18:34.784 --> 01:18:37.053
But she's gone now.

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:45.592
She'll never..

01:18:45.594 --> 01:18:47.330
'...go to prom..'

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:51.200
...or graduate or go to college.

01:18:53.469 --> 01:18:56.336
I know, I know.

01:18:56.338 --> 01:18:58.271
Must be hard to believe, huh?

01:18:58.273 --> 01:19:00.707
How could such a smart and pretty girl

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:03.746
be the daughter of a lowly hall cop?

01:19:06.749 --> 01:19:09.652
I told her not to tell
anyone that I was her dad.

01:19:11.487 --> 01:19:14.524
I didn't want you wolves making fun of her.

01:19:18.626 --> 01:19:20.263
It didn't matter.

01:19:21.729 --> 01:19:24.166
People made fun of her for other things.

01:19:26.735 --> 01:19:29.703
She wasn't the prettiest.

01:19:29.705 --> 01:19:31.707
She didn't have as much money.

01:19:33.342 --> 01:19:35.309
- 'She was shy.'
- She had friends.

01:19:35.311 --> 01:19:37.778
You wolves ate her alive.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.180
You all did, chewed
her up and spit her out.

01:19:40.182 --> 01:19:41.448
That's not true.

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:43.417
All of you jocks and populars

01:19:43.419 --> 01:19:46.453
and holier-than-thous who think
you're so much better than...

01:19:46.455 --> 01:19:48.187
We didn't hurt Jenny. I never hurt...

01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:50.492
Don't interrupt me!

01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:03.238
She was a delicate, little flower..

01:20:05.741 --> 01:20:08.078
...and you bullied her.

01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:14.314
You crushed her.

01:20:14.316 --> 01:20:16.719
You crushed her until she
couldn't take it anymore.

01:20:18.454 --> 01:20:21.090
So she slit her wrists.

01:20:23.558 --> 01:20:27.194
You might as well have
held the razor blade.

01:20:27.196 --> 01:20:29.762
No! I didn't kill Jenny.

01:20:29.764 --> 01:20:31.668
Yes, you did.

01:20:32.668 --> 01:20:34.168
You killed her.

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:35.735
You're a whore.

01:20:35.737 --> 01:20:40.207
Yes. You're gonna pay for
what you did to my Jenny.

01:20:40.209 --> 01:20:43.213
You're gonna pay for what you did to..

01:20:47.415 --> 01:20:48.817
Jenny.

01:20:50.853 --> 01:20:52.485
Where did you get this?

01:20:53.522 --> 01:20:55.521
Where did you get this?

01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:58.691
- Jenny was my best friend.
- You're a liar.

01:20:58.693 --> 01:21:00.560
This is Jenny's locket. You stole it.

01:21:00.562 --> 01:21:01.828
She gave it to me.

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:04.297
I didn't know it was a goodbye gift.

01:21:04.299 --> 01:21:07.467
You're lying. I would have known.

01:21:07.469 --> 01:21:10.270
Jenny told me everything.

01:21:10.272 --> 01:21:12.405
She was always covered in bruises.

01:21:12.407 --> 01:21:14.641
She tried to hide them, but I saw.

01:21:14.643 --> 01:21:16.310
Shut up.

01:21:16.312 --> 01:21:19.312
She told me her father
had a real temper problem

01:21:19.314 --> 01:21:21.381
but that she was handling it.

01:21:21.383 --> 01:21:23.417
You can't turn her against me.

01:21:23.419 --> 01:21:26.520
You're right. I can't because she's dead.

01:21:26.522 --> 01:21:29.922
She checked out of Hotel
Abusive Father aka her life.

01:21:29.924 --> 01:21:32.325
I didn't kill Jenny. You did!

01:21:32.327 --> 01:21:35.229
Shut up! Shut up.

01:21:35.231 --> 01:21:37.867
- Please.
- Shut up.

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:44.837
Lexi! Lexi. Lexi.

01:21:44.839 --> 01:21:46.606
Lexi, wake up. Wake, wake up, honey.

01:21:46.608 --> 01:21:48.275
There you are.

01:21:48.277 --> 01:21:49.943
God, I never thought I'd say this

01:21:49.945 --> 01:21:51.611
but I am so happy to see...

01:21:51.613 --> 01:21:53.279
Zombie Presley!

01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:54.815
- No. No!
- Get off me, you bitch!

01:21:54.817 --> 01:21:56.550
I'm here! I'm alive!

01:21:56.552 --> 01:21:59.352
Lexi, look at me, I'm alive. I'm alive.

01:21:59.354 --> 01:22:00.953
I am here, and I'm alive.

01:22:00.955 --> 01:22:04.257
- Presley?
- Yes. Yes. Okay?

01:22:04.259 --> 01:22:05.993
Okay, but there was a lot of blood

01:22:05.995 --> 01:22:08.595
and you, you looked like shit.

01:22:08.597 --> 01:22:11.664
Yeah, but I don't go down that easy, okay.

01:22:11.666 --> 01:22:13.734
Here, let me help you up.
Here we go, upsy-daisy.

01:22:13.736 --> 01:22:14.767
You promise you're not a zombie.

01:22:14.769 --> 01:22:17.003
I promise I'm not a zombie.

01:22:17.005 --> 01:22:18.939
Hundred percent human.

01:22:18.941 --> 01:22:20.673
Okay, there you go.

01:22:20.675 --> 01:22:24.645
Oh. Thanks for leaving behind the trophy.

01:22:24.647 --> 01:22:27.446
Came in handy.

01:22:27.448 --> 01:22:30.316
I don't understand. Was this all a joke?

01:22:30.318 --> 01:22:32.586
No, honey. It wasn't a joke.

01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:35.622
Assembly's gonna be really
depressing Monday morning.

01:22:35.624 --> 01:22:37.556
What do we do?

01:22:37.558 --> 01:22:39.458
Well, I always like to
start with the good news

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.028
and I transition into the bad.

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:42.695
Oh, when there's a pep rally Wednesday

01:22:42.697 --> 01:22:43.864
which is really gonna pump up...

01:22:43.866 --> 01:22:46.736
No, Presley. About him?

01:22:48.003 --> 01:22:49.703
Leave it there.

01:22:49.705 --> 01:22:51.808
Someone always picks
up the trash eventually.

01:22:56.545 --> 01:22:59.346
I'll take this.

01:22:59.348 --> 01:23:01.748
Hey, I'm sorry I called you crotch rot.

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:04.318
- What?
- Nothing.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.053
Okay. Oh, watch your step.

01:23:07.055 --> 01:23:08.622
'What about everybody else?'

01:23:08.624 --> 01:23:10.556
Well, considering old Pete did

01:23:10.558 --> 01:23:12.492
such a bang-up job of offing me

01:23:12.494 --> 01:23:15.529
I took the liberty of
checking a couple of pulses.

01:23:15.531 --> 01:23:17.963
I'm not saying they're going
to look cute come Picture Day

01:23:17.965 --> 01:23:19.565
but they won't look dead.

01:23:19.567 --> 01:23:21.702
Well, how about that? I saved us all.

01:23:21.704 --> 01:23:23.636
I thought I saved us all.

01:23:23.638 --> 01:23:26.506
Yeah, well, you also think
that dress goes with those pumps

01:23:26.508 --> 01:23:28.510
but we all make mistakes.

01:23:29.878 --> 01:23:33.012
Ah, I see. So we're
back to the game already.

01:23:33.014 --> 01:23:35.681
Mutual respect is so boring.

01:23:35.683 --> 01:23:37.784
Do that again and you can
join your little friends

01:23:37.786 --> 01:23:40.753
on the ride to the ER.

01:23:40.755 --> 01:23:43.724
I'm assuming that surviving
multiple murder attempts

01:23:43.726 --> 01:23:46.459
gets me a pass on those
extra Saturdays, right?

01:23:46.461 --> 01:23:49.128
Try coming back from the
dead and we can talk about it.

01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:53.100
That's weird. I'm actually..
