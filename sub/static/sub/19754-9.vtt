00:50.584 --> 00:53.194
You know we'll never be able
to prove he was murdered.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.489
Maybe not.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.462
I'm not sure I even care.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.234
I probably should, but...

01:07.235 --> 01:10.765
it's almost enough
to know that he...

01:10.771 --> 01:12.771
He didn't give up on us.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.720
Jocelyn needs to know that.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.027
Yes, come on.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.228
Stop. To the right,
to the right, to the right.

01:37.231 --> 01:41.201
Come on, everybody go out to the
side, all right, let's go, come on.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.842
One more time, one more time.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.509
Here we go right
one more time. Okay?

01:50.511 --> 01:51.711
Here we go, here we go.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.190
Be right back.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.626
Sorry for the intrusion,
sergeant.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.198
I promise this won't take long.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.527
Not today, Judge. Not any day.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.332
Daughter's birthday,

02:13.334 --> 02:16.603
- Congratulations.
- We are done with each other.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.242
Sergeant, look, I hear ya.

02:18.243 --> 02:19.708
You got every right to be angry.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.676
But you gotta help me
find Alcala.

02:21.677 --> 02:24.405
I helped you before
and you tried killing him.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.882
After you gave me your word.

02:25.883 --> 02:28.415
That was unfortunate.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.916
Have a good day, Judge.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.262
If you don't do it for me,
do it for Alcala's kids.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.355
What the fuck you say?

02:38.359 --> 02:41.359
He's got two boys. Great kids.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.130
Smart. Happy.

02:44.131 --> 02:48.067
This is his oldest going to
school just this morning.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.598
You gotta help me find Alcala,

02:49.603 --> 02:52.305
otherwise, I got no choice.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.606
I can't go to prison.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.810
I'll get what you want.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.881
And...

03:01.882 --> 03:04.351
Please apologize to Mrs.
Kessler for the intrusion.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.852
You get the fuck
away from my house.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.359
Look, Dad, look.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.402
Yes!

03:22.403 --> 03:24.571
There you go, PJ.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.072
Hold on. I can do this.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.313
Right, Dad?

03:42.423 --> 03:44.563
Get some, Dad, get some.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.401
I said get outta here. Now!

03:55.403 --> 03:57.970
Everything's fine.

03:57.971 --> 03:58.971
I'm leaving.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.549
So, your phone does work.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.387
I'm not gonna tell you
where she is.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.023
- I need to talk to her.
- Call her.

05:22.024 --> 05:25.224
She's like you.
She doesn't answer.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.455
She needs space.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.856
From me?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.573
Not just you.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.173
Look, you're trying to be
a good friend.

05:35.174 --> 05:36.898
I get that.

05:36.904 --> 05:40.740
Why don't you be a good
mother-in-law and let her be?

05:40.741 --> 05:45.511
Let me ask you a question.
Since you're her friend.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.523
What do you think
she needs more,

05:47.524 --> 05:50.675
space... or closure?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.440
God.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.484
Dad.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.951
Hey, you should probably
have another cup,

06:59.953 --> 07:03.493
I can still smell
the single malt.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.658
Look, I'm... I'm not hungry.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.660
I got biscuits,
sausage and a waffle.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.963
Are you trying to kill me?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.970
'Cause you're, like,
number 13th in the will.

07:12.971 --> 07:14.766
The most you're
looking at getting

07:14.768 --> 07:17.138
is, some old sneaks.
Maybe a hoodie.

07:17.139 --> 07:19.606
Whatever. Look,
I got wheatgrass, too.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.337
It's good for
the blood pressure.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.080
You know why black people
don't drink that shit, right?

07:24.081 --> 07:24.977
Why?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.408
Because we suffered enough.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.984
How's the
endorsement list coming?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.754
I need everybody in before
we, make the announcement.

07:34.755 --> 07:35.915
I'm marking them off.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.992
Goldstein even asked
if he can co-chair

07:37.993 --> 07:40.631
the re-elect Robert Boston
finance committee.

07:40.632 --> 07:43.295
See?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.726
That's building a bridge.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.032
A long, skinny Jewish bridge.

07:47.034 --> 07:50.002
I didn't see
Pernell's name on the list.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.771
No, you didn't.

07:51.772 --> 07:56.308
Okay, so, where's the campaign
money coming from now?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.978
- Brooks hasn't endorsed yet.
- Yeah, he will.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.579
Dad, you know his money
doesn't come free, either.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.550
Nobody's does.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.118
Just about setting the price.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.587
It's perfect.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.756
And the way
the market is right now,

08:08.757 --> 08:10.086
you're gonna do
very well, Tessie.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.590
Great.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.430
Now, let's talk timeframe.
Have another place in escrow.

08:14.431 --> 08:17.096
I don't want to carry both mortgages
any longer than I have to.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.666
Are you kidding? I'm gonna
have multiple offers

08:19.667 --> 08:21.227
before the first open house.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.468
Perfect.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.738
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Hey.

08:23.739 --> 08:25.267
You're not
bringing this in here.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.182
Where would you like it?
I got more in the truck.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.052
Shay, why don't you go take
some pictures of the backyard.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.283
Okay.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.289
Um...

08:48.061 --> 08:49.095
How you been?

08:49.096 --> 08:50.426
What the hell is this?

08:50.430 --> 08:54.100
Judge Harris thought
you might need some things,

08:54.101 --> 08:56.068
it's for the baby.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.609
- Here.
- You are taking all this shit back.

08:58.610 --> 09:00.636
- Now.
- I can't do that.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.841
You're gonna need these things.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.042
Baby's gonna need these things.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.183
I don't want anything
from Pernell.

09:05.184 --> 09:08.147
That includes you.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.148
Go.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.161
Get it, Moonlight,
get it, get it, get it.

09:20.162 --> 09:23.295
Good boy. Good boy,
bring it here.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.456
Bring it here.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.399
Out, out, out, out.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.434
Out.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.495
Okay.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.006
Ready? Ready?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.437
You ready?

09:35.442 --> 09:36.642
Are you ready?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.654
Go get it.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.716
Good boy, get it.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.417
Get it, come here.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.318
Bring it here.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.391
Yeah.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.216
Did you find Alcala?

10:17.217 --> 10:19.047
No. He's nowhere.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.622
Nobody knows where
they have him stashed.

10:20.623 --> 10:21.790
Bullshit. You're lying.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.519
Fuck you, I don't lie.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.164
I called in all my favors.

10:26.165 --> 10:28.394
Chief put him down real tight.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.855
Hey, look at me.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.664
If you mess with that family,

10:31.665 --> 10:32.965
- I swear to God, I will find...
- Scott.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.366
Listen. I thought maybe
you were the guy.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.208
Maybe take a hose to the
department and clean it out.

10:39.209 --> 10:41.206
But you threatened that
man's family, his kids.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.638
Scott, relax. I'd never do that.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.748
It was just some kids at
school I took pictures of.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.919
I gotta find Alcala, man.
It's all I got.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.586
Yeah? Well, you got nothing.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.717
You hear that? Nothing.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.797
You're not wearing that
to voir dire today.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.839
What?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.074
No. No. No.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.335
Pernell.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.811
Pernell.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.749
I need your head
in the game today.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.319
We... We need a fair jury.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.747
Which would be a miracle.
You need to go home,

11:26.754 --> 11:30.364
and change into the "I am so fuckin'
innocent" shirt and tie combo

11:30.365 --> 11:32.757
the jury consultant sent over.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.030
You think maybe
we could persuade the judge

11:34.031 --> 11:35.857
to postpone this thing
for a couple of days?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.596
Why? Somebody die?

11:37.597 --> 11:39.067
You plannin' on
bein' in the ICU?

11:39.068 --> 11:40.496
I need a reason to give her.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.440
I-I... I just... I just got
somethin' I gotta do.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.404
What?

11:45.405 --> 11:46.765
I want to hear this.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.114
I want to hear
what you're choosing

11:48.115 --> 11:49.778
over making a good
first impression

11:49.779 --> 11:51.807
on the people that will be
deciding your fate.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.452
I really want to know
what trumps that.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.451
Look, Daddy, look.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.358
What do you got there, kid?

12:02.359 --> 12:03.885
Excuse me?

12:03.891 --> 12:05.260
What are you lookin' at?

12:05.261 --> 12:07.158
Pernell, I don't
have time for this.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.326
I love Mommy and Daddy.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.865
I made it for you.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.326
- You like it?
- I love it.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.902
What? Love what?

12:15.903 --> 12:18.337
- I gotta go.
- No, wait, wait.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.506
Okay.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.507
Wait. PJ!

12:27.848 --> 12:29.648
All right, I'm gonna
make this easy, Pernell.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.149
Be at voir dire ready to
be sympathetic at 11:00,

12:32.152 --> 12:33.392
or find a new lawyer.

12:33.393 --> 12:35.356
Nick. Nick, come on.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.094
Do you know why
I took this case?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.825
Because Crystal asked me to.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.233
And I said yes.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.566
Because I don't want to
owe you anything...

12:51.571 --> 12:52.871
when I take her from you.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.855
Hey.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.557
Did you get the gifts?

13:11.558 --> 13:15.858
Stop calling me, and stop
sending things for my son.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.496
Our son.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.867
No. This child is gonna have
a normal life.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.068
Without a father.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.569
I didn't say that.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.538
What does that mean?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.039
The best chance this kid
can have is with me,

13:29.042 --> 13:31.512
and the stable home
I am making for him.

13:31.513 --> 13:34.411
You need to step back
and let me do this my way.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.984
Understood?

13:38.886 --> 13:40.346
How'd you get pregnant, Tessie?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.557
Get out of my way.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.788
Woman in your profession,
as smart as you are,

13:47.794 --> 13:49.304
doesn't make
a mistake like this.

13:49.305 --> 13:51.896
You ever read the warning label?

13:51.899 --> 13:54.699
No contraception is
100 percent effective.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.435
But you kept it.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.536
Why?

13:58.538 --> 14:01.138
Because it's a miracle,
and you know it.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.741
No.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.144
I saw a way to make some money.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.605
My wealthiest customer
was losing his mind,

14:07.614 --> 14:10.084
and I figured I could
take care of myself for good.

14:10.085 --> 14:11.683
It wasn't a miracle,
it was math.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.924
So, why didn't you tell me
if you were just cashin' in?

14:13.925 --> 14:15.591
Why did you hide it from me?

14:15.592 --> 14:17.818
I said it started that way.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.825
It's not like that now.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.086
Now, move.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.531
Tessie.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.499
If this turns into a war,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.769
you're gonna lose.
You gotta know that.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.470
Is that so?

14:32.472 --> 14:35.682
I never heard of anybody winning
a custody battle from prison.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.350
All rise.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.451
The Honorable Judge
Stanton presiding.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.961
Be seated.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.996
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:54.997 --> 14:56.955
You are all being
considered as jurors

14:56.964 --> 14:58.670
in the state of
California's case

14:58.671 --> 15:00.065
against Pernell Harris,

15:00.067 --> 15:02.167
who is being charged
with murder.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.509
Counselors, are we ready to
proceed with voir dire?

15:05.510 --> 15:07.365
Yes, your honor.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.114
You may question your first juror, Mr.
Tramble.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.877
Thank you, your honor.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.222
Good morning, ma'am.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.010
Are you familiar with
Pernell Harris?

15:44.011 --> 15:45.548
I saw him on the Lavey Show.

15:45.549 --> 15:47.275
And did you form an opinion
of Mr. Harris

15:47.280 --> 15:49.118
when you were
watching that show?

15:49.119 --> 15:50.646
To me, it's pretty obvious.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.020
He's guilty.

15:55.055 --> 15:58.124
I'm sorry, and what makes
you think he's racist?

15:58.125 --> 16:00.185
My son's a freshman
at Eli Harris High.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.400
The school has a graduation
rate of just 40 percent,

16:03.401 --> 16:05.096
but that doesn't matter
to Judge Harris.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.098
He's more interested in protecting
the name of the damn school

16:08.101 --> 16:09.501
than helping the students.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.242
I don't trust him. He just says

16:11.243 --> 16:13.538
anything he can to distract us.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.870
I've got a daughter like that.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.475
I don't see her anymore.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.176
I don't like how
he called the cops dirty.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.048
Rich people think they can
do whatever they want.

16:20.049 --> 16:23.215
I am open-minded,
but DNA doesn't lie.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.716
Are you or any of
your family members

16:24.717 --> 16:26.587
in the law enforcement
profession?

16:26.588 --> 16:29.486
Do you consider yourself
religious?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.419
How would you define
reasonable doubt?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.494
You've heard me ask this
question a few times today.

16:33.495 --> 16:36.062
Have you met or do you have
an opinion of Mr. Harris?

16:36.063 --> 16:37.296
Yeah, I know him.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.297
He sentenced my son
to eight years for weed.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.700
And he didn't even kill a cop
like the judge did.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.839
What kind of shit is that?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.736
How do you feel
about the death penalty?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.908
I don't have a problem
with the death penalty.

16:47.909 --> 16:49.437
It just depends on the crime.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.382
Mr. Harris has damned
himself for an eternity.

16:52.383 --> 16:55.514
Some people deserve to die.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.584
There he is. Have a seat.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.145
I'm glad you could make it, Dad.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.089
Can I start you guys off
with some drinks?

17:04.090 --> 17:05.361
What would you like?

17:05.362 --> 17:08.098
Two single malts.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.896
Since when do you drink scotch?

17:10.896 --> 17:13.767
Ever since I was 12 and I started
stealing it from your cabinet.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.734
The way you drink,
you never noticed.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.739
Look, Dad.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.608
Look.

17:24.844 --> 17:28.146
This is something
I've been working on.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.348
"Bathwater."

17:31.518 --> 17:34.786
I need 25 grand
to get things started up.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.557
I know it's a lot of money,

17:36.558 --> 17:38.156
but I... I thought that...

17:39.992 --> 17:41.330
You don't need 25 grand.

17:41.331 --> 17:43.128
I knew you wouldn't understand.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.960
I don't know why I thought
this would be any different.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.634
You need at least 100 grand.

17:46.635 --> 17:48.667
To get capitalized.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.336
I tell you what.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.607
I'll give you 250 thou,
just to be safe.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.175
You will?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.206
Yeah, I will.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.680
You can do anything, kid.
Anything.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.251
I believe in you.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.621
Wish you'd said that
the first time around

18:07.622 --> 18:09.860
instead of telling me
to get a real job.

18:09.861 --> 18:11.756
Yeah, that sucked.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.488
Probably wouldn't have cheated on
Jocelyn if you believed in me.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.200
Which means she
wouldn't have been raped.

18:16.201 --> 18:18.326
And my best friend
would still be alive.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.866
And Shane Caldwell.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.167
And me.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.035
Don't say that.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.206
Don't say that!

18:26.773 --> 18:27.973
Don't say that!

18:27.974 --> 18:29.040
Don't say that!

18:29.041 --> 18:32.644
Pernell.
Man, what are you doing?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.005
What?

18:34.013 --> 18:36.182
You have to at least act like
you're paying attention.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.423
What are you writing? Is that
supposed to mean something?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.497
I have to go.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.645
Here you go.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.876
Yeah, thank you.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.221
Good morning to you.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.316
That work?

19:15.322 --> 19:18.290
Mr. Mayor.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.326
Always good to see you.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.227
That's the... what, the Alexander
Graham Bell trick, right?

19:24.231 --> 19:25.431
Trying to brainstorm on the edge

19:25.432 --> 19:26.672
between a wink and a sleep?

19:26.673 --> 19:28.334
Hypnagogia.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.895
- Yeah.
- Yes, it works.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.704
At least, for me.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.405
Coffee?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.607
Single plantation Kenyan.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.278
Sure. Nice to see something else

19:39.279 --> 19:42.279
from Africa in this building.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.852
Try the chair.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.658
It's engineered to stimulate
thought and creativity.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.627
Nah, yeah. No, I'm more of
a think the shower type.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.758
This morning I was in the
shower thinkin' about you.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.466
- Did you have an epiphany?
- I did.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.067
We need to formalize what we've
been talking about, you and me.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.299
And I believe
we're on the same page

20:04.304 --> 20:05.714
regarding the future
of this city.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.077
But you haven't committed
to, endorsing me

20:10.078 --> 20:11.306
for re-election yet.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.683
I'm not going to.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.953
Excuse me, the last time we
spoke we were all kumbaya

20:19.954 --> 20:22.321
talkin' African bees
taking over the hive.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.792
Chaos and a new power
structure, you and me.

20:24.793 --> 20:26.825
We were?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.626
Then I learned about
the subpoena.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.628
You're dirty laundry is about
to be aired in a major trial,

20:31.631 --> 20:33.601
diminishing your contribution
to the new power structure,

20:33.602 --> 20:38.240
and, unfortunately, eliminating
my contribution to you.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.782
What if there's no trial?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.019
Then we'd have
a lot to talk about.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.434
Yeah, I'll just see myself out.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.442
Thank you for coming
out here to tell me.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.347
It's not something I'd want
to hear over the phone.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.920
We don't know who killed him.

21:29.656 --> 21:30.916
There's something else.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.560
If PJ was killed,

21:36.563 --> 21:39.130
that means his...

21:39.131 --> 21:42.568
suicide note...

21:42.569 --> 21:44.469
wasn't a suicide note.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.445
This is why you came here.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.146
I... I don't... I don't want to...

21:55.147 --> 21:56.677
- I don't want to read this, I...
- Jocelyn.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.784
- No.
- He wrote it for you.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.615
He's trying to
tell you something.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.861
- Just read it.
- If I do that,

22:02.862 --> 22:06.224
then it all comes back.
Do you understand?

22:06.225 --> 22:08.285
And it hurts just as much
on the way back up

22:08.294 --> 22:09.534
as it did going down.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.868
He was ready to move on,
all right?

22:12.869 --> 22:14.395
- A new love and a new life...
- No.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.767
I just want to do
the same thing.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.998
No, he wasn't gonna
do that to you.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.004
- No, he loved you.
- Please.

22:19.005 --> 22:23.405
He might have
lost his way, but...

22:23.410 --> 22:24.740
He loved you.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.413
Please.

22:27.414 --> 22:30.854
Please, Ann, stop calling.

22:35.422 --> 22:39.425
Jocelyn and I...

22:39.426 --> 22:41.886
we're trying to have a baby.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.429
No, I can't.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.560
I can't.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.777
What did you find out?

23:01.781 --> 23:04.916
How about a "How are you?"

23:04.917 --> 23:07.317
"I know this has been
tough on you as well."

23:07.319 --> 23:08.587
Seriously?

23:08.588 --> 23:10.357
That's what you want, seriously?

23:10.358 --> 23:12.456
No, you idiot.
I want you to beat this

23:12.459 --> 23:14.289
so we get back to work.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.933
If I watch any more Fox TV,

23:15.934 --> 23:19.197
I'm gonna shoot myself
in the face.

23:19.198 --> 23:24.936
My guy in records
confirmed that 1-1-Q-0-0-9-7

23:24.937 --> 23:28.167
is a motorcycle license plate.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.275
I knew it.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.376
For a dead guy.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.608
Shit!

23:33.613 --> 23:35.951
Now, just slow down.
That actually helped,

23:35.952 --> 23:38.588
because I had time to
dig a little deeper,

23:38.589 --> 23:41.585
and I found out that dead guy

23:41.588 --> 23:44.588
is renting a trailer
over in Alameda.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.756
That's gotta be where
they're holding Alcala.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.932
Did you get an address?

23:55.535 --> 23:56.765
I don't see
anything I haven't seen

23:56.769 --> 23:58.737
a hundred times before.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.568
There's something there,
there's gotta be.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.779
Maybe not.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.912
He wrote poetry

24:06.913 --> 24:09.319
while somebody held
a gun to his head.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.245
He could have written "I'm
sorry, I love you, goodbye,"

24:12.251 --> 24:13.284
but he didn't.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.085
PJ wrote a lot of poetry.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.117
It's one more thing
you didn't know about him.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.763
Come on, Moonlight, let's go.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.663
I know that he wouldn't want
"Bathwater" lost forever,

24:24.664 --> 24:26.534
and I know that he wrote code,

24:26.535 --> 24:29.568
so I think he's trying to
tell us where it is,

24:29.569 --> 24:31.199
or maybe who killed him
or, I don't know,

24:31.203 --> 24:32.303
something else.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.344
Thought I left
all this behind me.

24:33.345 --> 24:34.639
It'll still be waiting for you

24:34.641 --> 24:37.541
when you get back to
San Vicente.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.282
I'm not going back
to San Vicente, Crystal.

24:40.283 --> 24:41.449
I already put the house up,

24:41.450 --> 24:44.115
and looked at
some places in Portland.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.316
I like it up there,
there's nice people,

24:46.318 --> 24:47.948
and no memories.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.015
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.664
Your honor,

24:58.665 --> 25:00.465
given the bias of
this jury pool,

25:00.466 --> 25:01.926
I'd like to ask for additional...

25:01.934 --> 25:03.572
I think we're done, Mr. Tramble.

25:03.573 --> 25:04.939
You're out of challenges.

25:04.940 --> 25:06.667
If all the jurors
currently seated

25:06.673 --> 25:08.113
would remain in their seats.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.177
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

25:12.178 --> 25:16.078
I instruct you to not discuss
this case with anyone.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.482
This is a big case.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.790
Maybe the biggest in
San Vicente's history.

25:19.791 --> 25:22.216
I instruct you to
not form an opinion

25:22.221 --> 25:25.321
until all of the evidence
has been presented.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.492
Now, we will begin in two days.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.603
I suggest you all get some rest,

25:29.604 --> 25:31.626
visit with family,

25:31.631 --> 25:33.601
and prepare yourselves.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.267
Good luck, counselor.

25:36.268 --> 25:40.168
You think your, client will
bother to show up for the trial?

25:40.172 --> 25:41.712
Really think it would
make a difference?

25:41.713 --> 25:43.608
How about a hug?

25:43.610 --> 25:44.940
Fuck you.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.790
19. Over there.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.895
Excuse me.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.338
You know the guy
who lives in 19?

26:13.339 --> 26:14.539
Ray? Not really.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.908
He keeps to himself pretty much.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.177
- Is he home?
- Nope.

26:19.178 --> 26:23.178
This Ray, has he, got a
beard, kind of a stocky guy?

26:23.182 --> 26:26.384
Ray's got a beard.
I don't know about stocky.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.685
Thank you.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.960
Easy, easy.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.704
Here we go. Come on.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.671
Why don't you let me
go in there first?

26:45.672 --> 26:47.072
Make sure that kid's right.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.839
We can wait for
Alcala here, right?

27:58.811 --> 28:00.811
This is the guy.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.480
What guy?

28:02.481 --> 28:04.421
The guy who was talkin' to
Chief Clay in the warehouse.

28:04.422 --> 28:05.946
The one who cut me.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.752
What's Alcala
got to do with this guy?

28:12.591 --> 28:15.091
Holy shit.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.863
What?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.774
This isn't about Alcala at all.

28:19.775 --> 28:20.896
What?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.800
That license plate
was given to me by PJ.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.003
He's the one that sent us here.

28:25.004 --> 28:28.073
- For what?
- For the video.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.784
The one Heather Caldwell
was tellin' me about.

28:29.785 --> 28:31.206
Didn't you say
he said he had it?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.780
Yeah. Shit.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.850
Let's go. Move that fuckin' pen.

29:09.851 --> 29:11.218
Move that fuckin' pen!

29:11.219 --> 29:12.917
- Let's go.
- Come on, buddy!

29:12.919 --> 29:14.419
- Shane, grab his arm.
- Move it. Hurry up.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.960
Start your writing, son.
Come on. Come on.

29:15.961 --> 29:17.515
Don't fight us. Don't fight us!

29:17.523 --> 29:19.229
- Fuck you!
- Don't fuckin' fight us!

29:19.230 --> 29:21.655
- Fuck you!
- This doesn't go right,

29:21.660 --> 29:23.300
we'll bring your wife here, we'll
shoot her right in front of you.

29:23.301 --> 29:25.055
You don't fuckin' touch her.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.504
We will fuckin' shoot her
in front of you.

29:26.505 --> 29:27.565
Get up. Get up.

29:27.566 --> 29:30.135
You stay away from her.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.396
- Either way, it's gonna happen.
- Sit the fuck down.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.174
You're not gonna
fuckin' hurt her.

29:34.175 --> 29:36.474
Give him the gun.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.905
Give him the gun. Do it.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.184
Come on. Do it. Now!

29:46.185 --> 29:49.415
I'm sorry, Jocelyn.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.221
I love you.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.065
Sh... Shit! Shit!

30:00.066 --> 30:01.996
Come on. Get back in here.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.901
- Settle the fuck down.
- Shit, there's a lot of blood.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.572
Put his gun hand by his head.

30:05.573 --> 30:07.238
- Come on, get this right.
- Hey!

30:07.239 --> 30:08.469
Watch where you're
steppin', man.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.408
We already have enough
to clean up.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.179
- Okay, listen, listen.
- Shh. No. It's too perfect.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.946
Okay, pull him down.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.447
Twist his body.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.018
And bend him forward a little.

30:18.019 --> 30:19.517
Put that gun hand
up by his head.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.416
- All right.
- How's that?

30:28.794 --> 30:31.096
It's good.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.357
Let's get the fuck out of here.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.871
Judge Harris!

30:39.872 --> 30:41.712
Boss! Boss.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.046
We gotta go.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.193
Let me finish this.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.274
Come on. We're in a hurry.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.011
Get in the car.

31:45.637 --> 31:46.637
Dad, you okay?

31:47.974 --> 31:48.974
Yeah.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.735
Same old shit every election.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.212
I got Brooks on board, though.

31:52.213 --> 31:53.848
I hope that's a good thing.

31:53.849 --> 31:55.075
At least with Pernell,

31:55.081 --> 31:56.481
we knew what
we were getting into.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.149
What?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.990
You backin' Pernell up now?

31:59.991 --> 32:02.246
I'm not backin' him, he's just...

32:02.254 --> 32:04.464
The rich devil
you know, I guess.

32:04.465 --> 32:07.025
Pernell had baggage,
he always did.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.494
Hell, Pernell was baggage.

32:09.495 --> 32:10.595
Brooks is just money.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.656
He's a fire hydrant
full of money.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.672
- Look, I know what I'm doing.
- I know you do, Dad,

32:14.673 --> 32:15.826
but it takes more than money

32:15.834 --> 32:17.302
to open the doors
Pernell opened.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.773
Motherfucker, can you
give a man his due?

32:18.774 --> 32:20.708
You know how much
I did without him?

32:20.709 --> 32:23.406
You think he had his hand up
my ass making this city work?

32:23.409 --> 32:26.009
- Dad, I'm not sayin' that.
- What are you sayin'? What are you sayin', boy?

32:26.012 --> 32:27.312
You sayin' I can't
sit in this chair

32:27.313 --> 32:28.613
without some asshole
pulling it out for me?

32:28.614 --> 32:29.582
- No.
- That's my chair!

32:29.583 --> 32:31.121
I'm making choices
no one wants to make

32:31.122 --> 32:32.817
every single day.
Is that enough...

32:32.818 --> 32:34.848
Dad. Dad!

32:34.853 --> 32:36.621
Dad!

32:36.622 --> 32:38.556
Get my pill.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.587
My pill.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.492
Fuck!

32:42.494 --> 32:43.494
Mr. Mayor.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.195
Open your mouth,
open your mouth.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.068
You're all right, Dad.
You're all right. Okay.

32:48.069 --> 32:51.597
Okay. Just breathe.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.571
I'm okay.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.110
That never would have happened,
Tessie, if you called me first.

32:56.111 --> 32:57.138
You're supposed to consult me

32:57.143 --> 32:58.543
before any large purchases.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.582
I will consult with you
whenever I damn well please.

33:01.583 --> 33:03.250
This is my money
we are dealing with.

33:03.251 --> 33:05.379
You work for me.

33:05.384 --> 33:10.055
Now, explain to me why
my escrow check bounced?

33:10.056 --> 33:12.456
Your money's tied up,
long term stuff.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.158
You didn't tell me to
plan for early retirement.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.628
Well, now you know the plan.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.164
Where is my money?

33:19.165 --> 33:21.825
Exactly.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.934
A lot of it's gone.

33:23.935 --> 33:26.365
What do you mean, gone?
Gone where?

33:26.372 --> 33:29.210
The stock market has been doing fine.
Bonds, too.

33:29.211 --> 33:30.538
I thought we had more time,

33:30.542 --> 33:33.544
so I took some chances
that didn't work out.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.875
- You...
- They might. Eventually.

33:35.881 --> 33:40.451
I told you to put it
into boring shit.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.122
My job was exciting enough,

33:42.123 --> 33:45.621
I didn't need big returns,
I needed steady returns.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.464
Let me be straight
with you, Tessie.

33:49.465 --> 33:51.161
Well, it's about damn time.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.564
I figured there was
no down side.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.395
Either we make
a shit load of money,

33:55.401 --> 33:58.869
you're happy and I'm
driving something Italian.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.640
Or it goes south, and since
you're just a whore,

34:02.641 --> 34:04.311
who are you gonna complain to?

34:04.312 --> 34:05.980
You made your money
on your back,

34:05.981 --> 34:09.214
and there's no IRS
line item for that.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.114
That money doesn't exist.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.577
Not as far as
the law is concerned.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.496
Jesus.

34:30.668 --> 34:31.739
I'm calling the cops.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.371
What are you gonna do,
press charges?

34:35.373 --> 34:36.744
You're a whore's accountant.

34:36.745 --> 34:37.808
You don't exist

34:37.809 --> 34:40.208
as far as the law is
concerned, motherfucker.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.152
Get out of my damn house!

34:49.821 --> 34:50.960
Shit!

37:13.665 --> 37:14.665
It's empty.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.371
Relax, Keith.

37:20.372 --> 37:23.140
Toby didn't pick this
place to kill me.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.741
Then why meet here?

37:24.743 --> 37:28.112
I call the meeting,
he picks the spot.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.423
Here he comes.

37:51.637 --> 37:54.137
- What do you want?
- Let's go inside.

37:54.139 --> 37:58.039
He's not armed.
You leave your gun.

38:00.946 --> 38:01.976
Is he serious?

38:03.349 --> 38:04.649
He's got trust issues.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.077
What's this?

38:38.049 --> 38:40.385
A video.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.416
You killing my son.

38:42.421 --> 38:45.956
Found it. Ray Kelly's trailer.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.187
What do you want?

38:47.192 --> 38:49.699
I want you to make sure that
my murder trial goes away.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.795
You're feelin'
pretty good right now.

38:51.797 --> 38:56.197
I'm feelin' like I want to
hurt you really bad right now.

38:56.201 --> 38:57.470
But I'll settle for this.

38:57.471 --> 38:58.999
I got a surprise for you, too.

39:07.679 --> 39:11.148
Whatever you
want to know, just ask.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.818
Tell me what happened
to Shane Caldwell.

39:13.819 --> 39:16.119
- Come on, Bobo.
- You said anything.

39:18.624 --> 39:21.291
Caldwell was dirty.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.894
He raped Jocelyn.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.325
I did what had to be done.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.865
Bobo, wait.

39:27.866 --> 39:33.036
Just wait. Hear me out.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.438
I didn't kill him.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.781
But I ordered it done.

39:36.782 --> 39:39.305
Instead of watching him go free,

39:39.310 --> 39:40.850
and I wasn't gonna do that.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.554
Did he know?

39:49.555 --> 39:54.124
Who? Your BFF? Of course.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.525
Ordering a murder.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.858
That's first degree.

39:58.864 --> 40:03.133
Special circumstances of
Shane being a cop then...

40:03.134 --> 40:04.344
puts a needle in your arm.

40:04.345 --> 40:06.435
We got a problem, you and me.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.405
Yeah.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.136
We've got a problem.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.142
Stalemate.

40:20.886 --> 40:25.686
You're gonna make sure
my murder trial goes away.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.958
'Cause if I go to prison,

40:27.959 --> 40:31.429
I can't see any reason why that video
doesn't make the light of day.

40:38.169 --> 40:41.105
If anything happens to me...

40:41.106 --> 40:43.736
after I do this for you,

40:43.742 --> 40:46.877
your confession goes
straight to McCauley.

40:46.878 --> 40:47.948
Likewise.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.130
Let's go.

41:35.460 --> 41:36.660
Wait here.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.641
Hi, Dad.

41:50.642 --> 41:53.578
I'm so sorry.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.909
I couldn't be there
with you that day.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.484
Why? Would you have taken
that bullet for me?

41:58.485 --> 42:00.951
Yeah.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.421
Sure, of course I would have.

42:02.422 --> 42:03.790
Like you did just now?

42:10.395 --> 42:12.725
I didn't have any choice.
I mean...

42:12.731 --> 42:15.031
I can't do anybody any good
if I'm in prison.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.473
You let the guy
who murdered me walk.

42:17.474 --> 42:18.998
Judge maximum.

42:22.340 --> 42:25.010
We always have a choice.

42:27.613 --> 42:28.983
Look, Dad.

42:30.616 --> 42:31.876
Look.
