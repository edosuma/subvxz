Oh, great.</i>

5 seconds ago?</i>

01:11.807 --> 01:13.440
<i>Did you see my peener?
I mean, I don't care.</i>

that's, like, a super-rare thing.</i>

01:23.885 --> 01:25.085
- Noted.
- You know what?

01:25.087 --> 01:26.753
<i>I still got to pee just a little bit.</i>

01:26.755 --> 01:28.588

- Yeah, sure. Whatever.

01:41.436 --> 01:42.902
<i>There was an attack!
Oh, man.</i>

01:42.904 --> 01:45.305

<i>Sorry if you caught a glimpse
of my peener during that.</i>

01:52.080 --> 01:53.780
<i>You saw that, right?
Crazy.</i>

01:53.782 --> 01:55.882
It's not a big deal.

01:55.884 --> 01:57.183
- Literally.
- Pardon me?

<i>Hey, needle peen!</i>

01:59.321 --> 02:02.022
- So, what are you in for?
- Well, I was minding my own

02:02.024 --> 02:04.991
business, eating some food, and
then some more food started

02:04.993 --> 02:08.061
shooting at me, so I starting
eating that food, and then like

02:08.062 --> 02:10.597
two more foods surrounded me...
and I woke up here.

02:10.598 --> 02:14.116
[bleep] food, man.
[bleep] food.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.937
Abby!
We'd like to invite you to join

02:16.939 --> 02:19.206
the babysitters club!
All the baby-sitters in

02:19.208 --> 02:21.508
Stoneybrook join,
and the club only takes 15%.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.877
No, thanks.
I have my own clients, and I get

02:23.879 --> 02:26.113
- to keep all the money.
- We are babysitting in this town.

02:26.115 --> 02:30.817
- If we ask you to join, you join.
- Sorry.

02:32.487 --> 02:34.221
Hi, Todd.
I'm here for our date.

02:34.223 --> 02:36.690
Listen, I don't think we can
be boyfriend-girlfriend anymore.

02:36.692 --> 02:38.592
Baby-sitter club told me you have AIDS.

02:38.594 --> 02:40.894
- Now we're having a four-way.
- Wha...?

02:41.622 --> 02:43.797
How could they do this to me?

02:43.799 --> 02:48.668
Hmm?

02:52.741 --> 02:55.275
Mom, Dad!
They put a wolf in my closet!

02:55.277 --> 02:57.277
Who put a wolf in your closet?!

02:57.279 --> 02:58.945
No!

02:58.947 --> 03:02.282
I'll never join you!
I'll fight you to the gates of hell!

03:02.284 --> 03:06.720

03:26.408 --> 03:28.341
<i>- Together: Nay.
- Resolution fails.</i>

03:28.343 --> 03:31.011
Worth a shot, right?

03:31.013 --> 03:35.348
Oh, you are so adorable.
Okay...

03:35.350 --> 03:38.660
- now take all of your clothes off.
- Reow?!

03:39.571 --> 03:41.254
Visionaries, you shall

03:41.256 --> 03:44.724
receive magic in the form of
powerful animal totems.

Witterquick, due to your
blinding speed, receive

03:47.930 --> 03:51.531
the power of the cheetah!

03:51.533 --> 03:54.568
- Incredible!
- Toby, your stealth has earned

03:54.570 --> 03:57.037
you the totem of...
the toothpick fish.

03:57.039 --> 03:59.105
What the [bleep] is a toothpick fish?

03:59.107 --> 04:00.740
Oh, yeah!
I read about those.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.042
Some guy peed in the Amazon.

04:02.043 --> 04:05.011
The toothpick fish swam up his
urine stream and into his urethra.

04:05.013 --> 04:06.746
He had to have elaborate surgery.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.282
Merklynn, can I have another
totem, please?

04:09.284 --> 04:12.586
Not looking forward to swimming
up a pee stream into

04:12.588 --> 04:14.621
- a bad guy's donger!
- Once the totem has been

04:14.623 --> 04:19.059
- bestowed, it is permanent.
- Oh, that's fantastic news.

04:19.060 --> 04:22.519
Witness the rise of Darkstorm!

04:22.554 --> 04:26.666
To assert my dominance over you,
I shall piss on your battered bodies!

04:26.668 --> 04:31.790
- Ahh.
- Oh, jackpot! It's Toby time!

04:35.479 --> 04:38.754
Something's in my urethra! It is
like a bladder infection but worse!

04:38.755 --> 04:42.195
I-I need to get this checked out!

04:42.447 --> 04:46.753
- Toby, you saved our lives! Toby?
- I think he's still in

04:46.755 --> 04:50.970
- Darkstorm's dick.
- That is going to require elaborate surgery.

04:51.246 --> 04:53.821
Comrade Obama cut the
defense budget again,

04:53.822 --> 04:56.977
General Hawk. I can nix
our efficient drone program

04:56.978 --> 05:00.800
or the G.I. Joe program that
racks up billions to stop a single

05:00.801 --> 05:04.622
terrorist group! I mean, for [bleep] sake,
where were you on 9/11?

05:04.623 --> 05:07.838
Ending Cobra's scheme to conquer
America with an evil telethon!

05:07.847 --> 05:09.773
Oh, god.
I'll see myself out, sir.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.248
Goodbye, army of
village people rejects.

05:12.299 --> 05:14.847
Say hello to G.I. Drone!

05:16.084 --> 05:19.719
<i>* G.I. Drone *

<i>- Holy shit!
- Its purpose ... to bomb the</i>

<i>[bleep] out of whoever, whenever.</i>

05:37.873 --> 05:40.440
<i>Oh, yeah.
We have an erection, too.</i>

05:40.442 --> 05:43.661
- Hide in that hospital!
- What happened to proportionate

05:43.662 --> 05:47.568
[bleep] response?! I only
wanted to control the weather!

05:47.603 --> 05:50.517
<i>* G.I. Mother[bleep] drone *</i>

05:50.519 --> 05:53.453
According to passover
tradition, I will pardon one

05:53.455 --> 05:56.957
prisoner of your choosing.
Will you pardon the murderer

05:56.959 --> 05:59.793
Barabbas, or will you pardon Jesus?

05:59.795 --> 06:02.796
<i>Barabbas! Barabbas!
Barabbas!</i>

06:02.798 --> 06:05.865
- Barabbas, you are pardoned.
- What?

06:05.867 --> 06:09.428
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait. Which one is the magic one?

06:09.463 --> 06:11.938
I'm the magic one!

06:11.940 --> 06:14.706
No takebacks, chickenheads!

06:15.740 --> 06:19.244
The midnight society
is now in session.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.214
Can you all handle Betty Ann's

06:21.216 --> 06:25.452
scary story, or are
you afraid of the dark?

06:25.454 --> 06:28.088
My story actually happened to me.

06:28.090 --> 06:31.057
I call it "night of terror."

06:31.059 --> 06:34.527
<i>I agreed to a date with a guy,
who shall remain nameless, who I</i>

06:34.529 --> 06:36.079
<i>did not want to go out with.</i>

06:36.080 --> 06:37.630
But our parents are friends so I had to.

06:37.632 --> 06:40.000
<i>It was a shit-show from the</i>

06:40.002 --> 06:42.435
<i>moment he showed up in his
crappy Nissan.</i>

06:42.437 --> 06:45.305
<i>- Hi, Betty Ann!
- He was so nervous, he ejac'd in</i>

06:45.307 --> 06:48.541
<i>his khakis and then ran into
a low-hanging tree branch.</i>

06:50.779 --> 06:53.046
Hey, don't you drive a Nissan, Gary?

06:53.048 --> 06:55.448
What?! No!
Yes! I mean ...

06:58.753 --> 07:00.954
Oh, my khakis!

07:02.089 --> 07:04.457
Forrest, we've been married for a while.

07:04.459 --> 07:07.527
Maybe we should spice things up.
Talk dirty to me.

07:07.529 --> 07:10.330
- What does that mean, Jen-ny?
- I don't know.

07:10.332 --> 07:12.799
- Say something mean.
- Okay.

07:12.801 --> 07:17.003
- You are a [bleep] idiot.
- Not what I had in mind, Forrest.

07:17.005 --> 07:19.339
Say something else, but call me

07:19.341 --> 07:21.708
- a slut after.
- Okay.

07:21.710 --> 07:26.179
Staying sober is a daily
struggle for you... slut.

07:26.181 --> 07:28.214
Forrest! Just, um...

07:28.216 --> 07:32.018
be rough with me.
Don't worry. I'll like it.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.920
Ow!
Shit, Forrest!

07:33.922 --> 07:36.990
Spicing things up is hard, Jen-ny.

07:36.992 --> 07:39.447
I'm gonna go get some ice.

07:39.682 --> 07:42.095
Bitch be out of her damn mind.

07:43.097 --> 07:45.450
Ow! Ow!

07:46.134 --> 07:48.268
All right, y'all, let's get sexy!

07:48.270 --> 07:52.101
That was a terrible way to
start a grief-counseling session.

07:52.136 --> 07:53.540
- Yeah.
- How terrible.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.444
Honey, look out! Cliché!

07:57.446 --> 07:58.667
Huh?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.383
- What's happening?!
- Kre-o!

08:03.385 --> 08:05.848
They're everywh...

08:05.887 --> 08:08.088
Run!
There's something wrong with them.

08:08.090 --> 08:11.458
They look like us but different!

08:11.460 --> 08:15.471
This way! Hurry!
Your life has more value than other people!

08:19.366 --> 08:22.735
- Jerry, we need your expertise!
- My expertise?

08:22.737 --> 08:25.505
- I'm not a soldier!
- Jerry, we need a lawyer.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.610
Put simply, Jerry,
we're being invaded...

08:30.612 --> 08:34.179
- by imitation blocks.
- Off-brand products with

08:34.182 --> 08:36.982
- a taste for LEGO blood!
- They're nearly identical but

08:36.985 --> 08:39.652
different... wrong.
Like when you sit on your hand

08:39.654 --> 08:42.054
until it goes to sleep.
You try to pretend flo from the

08:42.057 --> 08:44.324
progressive commercials is
giving you an H.J.,

08:44.326 --> 08:46.426
but you know it's not flo.
You know that!

08:46.428 --> 08:48.995
She'd never be so clumsy, so artless.

08:48.997 --> 08:51.064
That's impossible!
We're trademarked!

08:51.066 --> 08:53.199
No, general. LEGO bricks
aren't protected by trademark.

08:53.201 --> 08:56.970
- They're protected by patent.
- Hell, man, what's the difference?

08:56.972 --> 09:00.173
The difference is...
patents expire.

09:00.175 --> 09:02.976
Cool! Someone turned that
legal document into a gif.

09:02.978 --> 09:04.677
- That's fun.
- Isn't it "jiff"?

09:04.679 --> 09:07.347
- Anyway, how do we stop it?
- There's nothing we can do.

09:07.349 --> 09:08.982
Don't worry, flo.
I'll protect you.

09:08.984 --> 09:10.984
Don't worry, girl from the
Wendy's commercials.

09:10.986 --> 09:12.686
Don't worry, Geico gecko.

09:12.687 --> 09:15.322
<i>They covered the whole globe
in no time ... </i>

09:15.440 --> 09:18.424
<i>Mega bloks, Kre-o,
Best-lock, Coco, Banbao,</i>

09:18.426 --> 09:23.112
<i>Rokenbok, Super blox, and Leggo with
two g's, which was especially insulting.</i>

09:25.258 --> 09:27.367
<i>* LEGO my baby *</i>

09:27.369 --> 09:29.736
<i>* LEGO my honey *
* LEGO my ragtime gal *</i>

09:29.738 --> 09:31.838
- Daddy, are we safe?
- Of course we are, son.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.673
People are singing, aren't they?
Ugh.

09:33.675 --> 09:35.909
That is the lowest form of music.

09:35.911 --> 09:39.179
<i>* Honey, you'll lose me *
* then you'll be left alone *</i>

09:41.845 --> 09:43.016
The terrible singing!

09:43.018 --> 09:45.385
They're attracted to
the terrible singing!

09:45.387 --> 09:47.353
- Ohh!
- Ow!

09:47.355 --> 09:49.489
Fire! Fire!
They're too fast!

09:49.491 --> 09:52.625
- Ohh!
- Jerry, I've found a way to

09:52.627 --> 09:55.028
- camouflage ourselves!
- That beats my solution.

09:55.030 --> 09:57.764
- Pew pew! Pew pew! Pew!
- LEGOs are machined to

09:57.766 --> 10:00.867
a tolerance of 10 micrometers!
That's why we're so expensive!

10:00.869 --> 10:03.937
But this serum will make us
look cheaper and sloppier!

10:03.939 --> 10:06.472
We look like them now!

10:06.474 --> 10:09.442
- I'd... rather... die.
- What?!

10:09.444 --> 10:12.912
- They have Transformers?
- No, son! No!

10:13.614 --> 10:15.481
Nooooo!

10:15.483 --> 10:17.884
You probably don't even want
to go on living now.

10:17.886 --> 10:20.587
Huh? Oh, that was just a kid
from my wife's first marriage.

10:20.589 --> 10:23.923
But that looked really painful.
Hit me with the juice!

10:25.552 --> 10:28.321
No! You turned me
into a [bleep] Duplo!

10:28.356 --> 10:31.898
It's the same company
as LEGO, you fool!

10:34.452 --> 10:38.612
Guys, is this ending working?
Let's re-shoot it.
