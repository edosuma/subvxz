WEBVTT

00:14.098 --> 00:16.635
Clark, I know hunting down Zoners
is your top priority.

00:16.809 --> 00:19.266
But if you haven't found anything
in South America...

00:19.436 --> 00:23.020
...we still have a situation back here
in Kansas we need to deal with.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.394
No, he'll be here in 15 minutes.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.854
Okay, great.
See you in a few.

00:31.323 --> 00:34.065
Dr. Caselli. You're early.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.985
And you are annoyingly persistent,
Miss Sullivan.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.699
I've already told you,
I don't know anything.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.080
Don't sell yourself short, doctor.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.367
I think you're a very knowledgeable man.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.786
In the last few months,
over a dozen patients...

00:46.964 --> 00:49.296
...have been transferred
out of Belle Reve.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.549
And I believe that's your signature
on all the paperwork.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.806
Patients are transferred in and out
of mental facilities all the time.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.145
Even ones that exhibit unusual abilities?

01:02.312 --> 01:04.098
Where were they transferred to?

01:04.273 --> 01:05.854
ls LuthorCorp involved?

01:06.024 --> 01:08.481
Does this have anything to do
with 33.1 ?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.946
Okay. I'll take that as a "no comment."

01:15.117 --> 01:17.449
I didn't want any of this.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.909
But it was so much money.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.711
-Chloe. You okay?
-Yeah.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.748
Just in the nick of time as always.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.008
It wasn't me.
He was down when I got here.

01:35.179 --> 01:38.512
What? Well, if it wasn't you,
then who—

01:44.188 --> 01:46.554
Dude, he's open.
Pass the ball. Pass the—

01:48.150 --> 01:50.562
What's the matter with you, man?

02:21.058 --> 02:23.265
Still too slow, Stretch.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.269
Bart.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.360
He got away from you?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.403
I thought you were
the fastest man alive.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.540
Whoever he was, he saved your life,
which is more than I can say.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.747
Come on, Clark, it wasn't your fault.
Even with all your powers...

03:32.921 --> 03:35.253
-...you can't be everywhere at once.
-I have to be.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.461
I'm the only one who can round up
prisoners from the Phantom Zone.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.217
And stop Lex from experimenting
on people with abilities.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.379
What'd you ﬁnd out from Caselli
about 33.1?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.390
Nothing. I'm not going to.
Caselli was in and out of prison...

03:46.560 --> 03:48.425
...before the ink could dry
on his prints.

03:48.604 --> 03:49.969
How'd he get out so fast?

03:50.147 --> 03:52.980
I don't know. But a LuthorCorp lawyer
paid Caselli a visit...

03:53.150 --> 03:54.765
-...right before his release.
-Lex.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.605
Caselli could be stashed
halfway around the world by now.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.316
I'll get in touch with Lionel.
He can tell us something.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.276
l'll sift through my LuthorCorp intel.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.692
Maybe we'll get lucky, come up
with a few crumbs.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.361
Hey, gorgeous.
What's up? You miss me?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.698
Bart Allen. We had a moment in
the Talon last time I was here.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.743
Two years ago.
Before you had a boyfriend.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.584
Oh, right. Wow, it's good
to see you again, Bart.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.874
Yeah, well, the pleasure's all mine,
seﬁorita.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.336
I'll see you around.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.015
Knock it off.
What's with the Spanish?

04:33.190 --> 04:35.476
Well, I just grabbed lunch
down in Mexico, man.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.358
They got this burrito down there,
El lntestino Bustor.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.691
You gotta take a run down there
with me to try one.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.025
What are you doing here?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.691
Well, I'm hanging out
with my amigo, man.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.531
-What's it look like?
-That's what I'm trying to ﬁnd out.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.538
Last time you blew through town,
you stole my dad's wallet...

04:51.708 --> 04:54.541
...swiped a priceless artifact from Lex.
Nearly got killed.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.451
Yeah. Yeah. Those were the days?

04:57.506 --> 05:00.293
Yeah, all right. Look, man.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.550
I already told you,
things are different now. Okay?

05:03.720 --> 05:07.212
Back then, I needed a super-kick
in the butt and you laid it on me.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.303
Since then there's been no stealing
for this gringo, I swear.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.468
Am I really supposed to just buy that?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.762
I could squirt out some tears,
if that'll help?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.476
No, but the truth might.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.515
What were you doing
at the Daily Planet?

05:18.694 --> 05:20.901
I saw Chloe-licious had a byline
a while back.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.733
l was in town on business,
ﬁgured I had to check it out.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.408
What kind of business?

05:25.575 --> 05:28.612
I'm a courier. I pick things up.
I drop them off.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.743
Lickety-split, don't have a ﬁt.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.582
All right. Look, man, whatever.
You don't trust me, that's ﬁne.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.415
Okay, I'll be gone
before you can even blink.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.751
I don't know...

05:43.301 --> 05:46.168
...I can still blink pretty fast.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.677
Mexico?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.429
Wanna go get that burrito?

06:05.115 --> 06:08.232
Now that is what I call
a three-martini lunch.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.077
It's a four-martini lunch.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.322
If you include the one that
you spilled down my shirt.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.615
-Right.
-Yeah.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.706
Well, how am I ever
going to make it up to you?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.839
I don't know because...

06:24.968 --> 06:26.799
...this is my favorite shirt.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.961
Oh, well, then...

06:29.139 --> 06:31.471
...I think we should get it
into the laundry...

06:31.641 --> 06:33.142
...so that it doesn't stain.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.847
Yeah, that's a good idea.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.528
I gotta take this.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.997
Go ahead.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.964
Give me ﬁve minutes.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.880
-|--
-You know...

07:10.055 --> 07:15.516
...what I had in mind is gonna take
a little longer than ﬁve minutes.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.686
Rain check?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.266
Sure.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.525
I'll just put it next to the rest of
the umbrellas you keep handing me.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.606
-Lois--
-I mean...

07:27.781 --> 07:33.993
...is it just me or is this relationship
all interruptus and no coitus?

07:36.248 --> 07:39.456
You're always running off just
when things start getting interesting.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.665
And I like being interested.
A lot.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.707
Yeah.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.373
Yeah, I know, you're right.
This—

07:50.011 --> 07:51.547
It's not fair to you.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.716
I think we should take a break.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.228
You mean like--? What?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.403
See other people?

08:07.571 --> 08:10.233
Well, okay. Yeah, I mean,
if that's what you want.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.320
l was thinking more along the lines
of taking a vacation.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.826
Together.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.747
-Really?
-Yeah. Really.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.328
No rushing out in the middle
of the good stuff?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.916
No. None.

08:28.091 --> 08:32.084
It'll be you, me...

08:32.262 --> 08:34.093
...and Monte Carlo?

08:34.264 --> 08:37.506
There's just a few things that I do
need to take care of before we go.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.094
And I think once we get--

08:41.771 --> 08:43.853
Oh, God, you're good at that.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.772
-l'|l start packing.
-Okay.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.865
Bye.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.179
I need to talk to you. You alone?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.053
Just me and my shadow, Dad.

09:17.224 --> 09:21.968
Lana's in Paris with Nell,
shopping for a wedding dress.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.931
It's good she's out of the country,
considering what's happening.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.769
Look, if this is about Dr. Caselli--

09:28.944 --> 09:30.775
Caselli? He's the least of our worries.

09:30.946 --> 09:34.359
Another LuthorCorp facility
has been hit. That's six.

09:34.532 --> 09:38.400
Each one of them has some connection
with 33.1.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.911
The only thing housed in those facilities
was peripheral research.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.494
All the vital data is still secure
in the mainframe.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.080
How long do you think before that
is compromised?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.996
If it ever became public that
LuthorCorp is experimenting...

09:50.173 --> 09:51.959
...on people with abilities—

09:52.133 --> 09:53.634
It won't.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.545
What's this?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.681
A single frame pulled off
a security camera...

09:58.848 --> 10:00.258
...from one of the break-ins.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.806
Whoever's responsible...

10:08.984 --> 10:12.442
...has the ability to move faster
than a speeding bullet.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.777
Such a unique individual would...

10:14.948 --> 10:18.611
...make an interesting test subject
to add to 33.1.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.366
Don't you think?

10:21.913 --> 10:23.119
What do you plan to do?

10:24.291 --> 10:27.783
Protect our investment.
Come on, I'll walk you out.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.197
Yeah, I got it.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.901
Meet me at the rendezvous.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.632
Hey, are we gonna do this?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.179
You're gonna lurk in the shadows
all night?

11:22.349 --> 11:23.680
Just being careful.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.215
After all...

11:25.393 --> 11:27.770
...l'm not as fast as you.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.535
Clark.

11:46.164 --> 11:49.247
I was just thinking about you.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.123
You got a funny way of showing it.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.455
I've left you half a dozen messages.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.874
I'm sorry. I've been preoccupied.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.711
Helping that doctor from Belle Reve
get out of jail?

12:00.095 --> 12:04.054
Clark, my involvement with Belle Reve
is past history.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.967
But it appears that you still have
a very active interest...

12:08.144 --> 12:10.226
...in breaking into LuthorCorp.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.892
-Where was this taken?
-Mexico.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.861
The LuthorCorp processing plant.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.525
If you're going to continue playing
games like this...

12:26.121 --> 12:27.486
...you should be more careful.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.992
This isn't me.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.531
No?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.087
Who is it then?

12:42.887 --> 12:46.345
God, Mrs. K, thank you so much.
This is so good.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.676
Where do you put it all?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.718
You eat more than Clark
and he's twice your size.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.853
Yeah. Well, you know,
I burn a lot of calories.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.854
Well, there's plenty more in the fridge.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.856
I have to run to a meeting.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.769
Would you mind cleaning up?

13:03.533 --> 13:05.524
Yeah, anything for you, Mrs. K.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.244
It's nice to have you here, Bart.
I hope you stay longer this time.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.913
Hey, what's up, man?
You just missed a killer spread.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.377
You can cut the act.
I know about LuthorCorp...

13:22.552 --> 13:25.214
...and the break-ins by somebody
who's as fast as me.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.595
Yeah, faster, actually.

13:28.766 --> 13:32.759
It's funny, I actually believed your
story about how I changed your life.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.771
Look, it's not a story, Clark.
Okay? Really, I'm not the same guy.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.603
You stole from Lex before,
you're stealing from him again.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.439
-What's the difference?
-lt's-- It's complicated.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.401
-l'm a smart guy. Explain it to me.
-I can't.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.362
Why not? I thought we were amigos?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.492
Yeah, well, we are.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.279
Then tell me why you're stealing
from LuthorCorp.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.749
ljust-- I can't.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.258
I'll ﬁnd out for myself then.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.302
Look, I'm sorry I can't tell you
all my secrets, Clark.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.937
Okay, I thought a guy like you
would understand it.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.278
-I know it's just a vacation, but--
-What? Vacation?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.037
No, vacation is Palm Springs.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.699
Monte Carlo is a fairy tale.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.744
Yeah, hopefully
without Prince Charming...

14:40.922 --> 14:44.164
...having a disappearing act
every ﬁve minutes.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.256
I think you'll be keeping
his full attention, Lois.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.714
Yeah. You know, I'd better.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.972
It's not like I go Victoria's Secret
for anybody.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.424
What do you think?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.468
-Should I have gone with the black?
-No.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.021
Something tells me
green is deﬁnitely his color.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.808
Hey, Chloe--

15:04.237 --> 15:06.694
God, Smallville. Learn how to knock.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.485
Lois is jetting off to Monte Carlo
with Oliver.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.324
Oliver?

15:15.498 --> 15:17.830
Yeah, I'll send you a postcard
if I'm not too busy.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.913
-No, Lois, you should—
-Get a couple new bikinis?

15:21.838 --> 15:25.251
Good idea.
Thanks, Smallville.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.962
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to help Oliver keep his secret from her.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.258
That he's the Green Arrow?
No offense, Clark, but you weren't...

15:36.436 --> 15:38.518
...honest with Lana
about your secret either.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.224
Look how that ended up.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.348
Maybe all keeping secrets does
sometimes...

15:43.526 --> 15:46.188
...is force you to lie to people
you care about.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.194
Are we still talking about Oliver?

15:53.870 --> 15:56.282
The guy who saved you
at the Planet?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.955
He didn't exactly get away.
It's Bart.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.741
What? Wait a minute.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.911
-Bart can superspeed too?
-He's actually a lot faster than I am.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.205
That's the truth.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

16:07.383 --> 16:11.001
It's ﬁne, you were protecting him.
It's okay. If anyone gets it, it's me.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.215
But why are you outing him now?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.505
He's headed for trouble
and I need to ﬁnd him.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.968
Can you GPS his cell phone?

16:17.143 --> 16:19.304
Yeah, I can try.
Do you have his number?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.894
He broke into a LuthorCorp plant
down in Mexico.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.555
Now, I think Lex is on to him.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.724
If he tries to break into
another facility—

16:25.902 --> 16:28.063
No good.
His phone must be off.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.396
What about call history?
Can you pull up a record?

16:31.574 --> 16:34.532
Legally? Absolutely not.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.204
There's over a dozen calls
to that number in the last 24 hours.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.335
Let's see who's on the other end.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.754
Artemis Global Consortium?
I've never heard of them.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.631
It's a subsidiary of JL International...

16:57.809 --> 17:01.347
...which is a satellite company
currently orbiting...

17:01.562 --> 17:03.098
...Queen Industries.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.771
It's Oliver.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.975
He's using Bart to attack LuthorCorp.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.536
I'm in.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.189
Not so fast now, are you?

18:01.497 --> 18:02.953
Oliver.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.623
Look, Clark, whatever's got
your tightie-whities...

18:05.793 --> 18:07.499
...in a bunch,
now's not the time.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.705
Where's Bart?

18:09.255 --> 18:12.463
I saw his phone records.
I know he's working for you.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.379
Not for me.
He's working with me.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.714
There's a difference.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.505
It's not gonna matter
when he ends up in jail or worse.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.514
You don't know
what you're talking about.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.596
I know how much you hate Lex.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.638
Is that why you recruited Bart?
To help with your little vendetta?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.898
No, to stop 33.1.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.068
You know about 33.1?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.862
Why didn't you tell me
what you were up to?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.323
Clark, do you check in with me...

18:42.497 --> 18:44.738
...every time you run off
to save the world?

18:47.043 --> 18:48.999
That's right. For a second there,
I forgot.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.331
You like to just wait
for trouble to show up.

18:51.506 --> 18:52.541
That's not true.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.047
Then why haven't you done anything
to stop 33.1?

18:55.218 --> 18:57.083
I was busy with another problem.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.377
What could be more urgent
than Lex Luthor...

18:59.555 --> 19:01.762
...developing an army
of super freaks, Clark?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.844
That's what he's doing.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.766
He's starting a war.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.558
What have you found out?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.224
Not enough.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.568
Last night, Bart inﬁltrated a place...

19:15.738 --> 19:19.230
...that was supposed to house
the mainframe for 33.1.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.695
That's the last time I heard from him.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.077
So I reconned the target this morning,
the place had been stripped clean.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.240
Everything's gone.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.417
The whole thing was a setup.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.578
Lex has Bart.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.292
We have to ﬁnd him.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.581
My team's already on it.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.090
Your team?

19:44.475 --> 19:46.261
Not everybody ﬂies solo, Kent.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.200
Morning, sunshine.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.374
I know you.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.961
You've stolen from me before.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.135
I want a lawyer.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.143
And I want a ponytail.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.929
Disappointment abounds.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.269
Who do you work for?

20:36.444 --> 20:38.309
What you see is what you get,
Goldilocks.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.318
You're a low-level thief.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.447
Swiping corporate data isn't your style.

20:43.618 --> 20:47.657
Now, tell me who you're working for
and this won't have to get unpleasant.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.826
All right.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.333
All right.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.672
I work for a guy...

20:59.842 --> 21:03.130
...called Mr. Kiss My Butt.
Would you like me to introduce you?

21:14.357 --> 21:17.440
The ﬂoor of your cell has been
outﬁtted with pressure plates...

21:17.610 --> 21:19.191
...designed to track movement.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.319
Stop in one place for even
a millisecond...

21:22.490 --> 21:24.276
...after I activate them...

21:24.450 --> 21:26.190
...and you fry.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.912
Last chance.

21:34.168 --> 21:38.252
Well, maybe you'll feel more talkative
when you get tired of running.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.724
AC, check the LuthorCorp manifests.

21:52.895 --> 21:53.930
Gotcha.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.891
How long you guys been
working together?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.601
I joined up about six months ago.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.232
Ollie and Bart had already been doing
their thing.

22:00.403 --> 22:04.112
-What about your girlfriend, Katherine?
-Dude, don't even go there.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.992
She gave it her best shot.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.742
But with all this hardware in me....

22:09.912 --> 22:11.368
I'm sorry, Victor.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.367
Ollie found me, I was living
on the streets.

22:14.542 --> 22:18.160
He gave me a warm meal,
roof over my head...

22:19.213 --> 22:20.919
...and a reason to go on living.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.592
Did he just say something nice
about me?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.927
Maybe he's starting to rust.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.309
AC, how'd you fall into all this?

22:35.479 --> 22:38.892
I got into a little trouble sinking
a whaler off the coast of Japan.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.933
A little trouble?
That's what you're gonna go with?

22:42.111 --> 22:45.069
Ollie had to save your scaly butt
from getting ﬁlleted.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.234
-I would've gotten out of it.
-Really?

22:47.408 --> 22:49.945
Before or after they pack you
into a thousand tin cans?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.610
Well, at least
he would've been dolphin-safe.

22:53.956 --> 22:57.119
Fish jokes.
That's all I ever get, are ﬁsh jokes.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.539
So how's Lois doing, man?
Is she all right?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.453
I think you'd have to ask your boss.

23:02.631 --> 23:06.123
Now's not the time.
We need to focus on locating Bart.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.839
And how exactly did you get him
involved in this?

23:09.013 --> 23:10.878
He's never been much of a team player.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.514
It looks like you two have something
in common.

23:17.646 --> 23:21.104
Actually, I was out on patrol
in Star City one night...

23:21.275 --> 23:22.890
...and I came across Bart.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.435
He was helping himself to a free meal.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.146
I could tell he was a good kid.
You know, he just...

23:28.324 --> 23:31.191
...needed a little direction.
So I offered him a job.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.949
Look where that got him.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.162
I underestimated Lex.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.035
It won't happen again.

23:41.670 --> 23:46.334
I've compiled a list of all LuthorCorp
holdings within a hundred-mile radius.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.043
Bart could be held
in any one of those facilities.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.671
That's a lot of real estate to cover.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.555
I think I know someone
who can help us narrow it down.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.317
Victor Stone and Arthur Curry
are working for him too?

24:07.488 --> 24:10.446
Oliver's been busy. Is there anything
in your LuthorCorp intel...

24:10.616 --> 24:13.028
...that could help ﬁnd out
where Bart's being held?

24:13.202 --> 24:16.535
I don't know. Wait.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.696
When I had my feelers out
for Dr. Caselli...

24:18.874 --> 24:21.365
...I managed to shake loose
some internal documents.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.206
In the last few days, there's been
equipment transfers...

24:24.380 --> 24:26.712
...to the Ridge Facilities in Metropolis.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.713
LuthorCorp moves equipment
all the time.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.499
This isn't a couple of forklifts.

24:30.678 --> 24:33.465
Half a ton of lead shielding,
electrical pressure plates...

24:33.639 --> 24:37.052
...more than $20 million of equipment
to measure high velocity particles.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.512
It's Bart. Take everything
and bring it to Oliver.

24:39.687 --> 24:40.767
Me? Clark—

24:40.938 --> 24:42.974
I can get to the Ridge faster myself.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.105
I can't let anything happen to Bart.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.598
Mr. Queen, its Chloe Sullivan.
Clark sent me.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.401
-Where's Clark?
-He went to rescue Bart.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.899
He told you about Bart?

25:33.073 --> 25:35.564
We trust each other.
Clark tells me everything.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.699
Well, almost everything.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.328
I did have to ﬁgure out about your
green leather fetish on my lonesome.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.580
Don't worry, I didn't say
anything to Lois.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.457
Although you might wanna consider--

25:45.628 --> 25:49.587
Hey, let's just stick to the
main plot there, sidekick.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.714
-So, what do you got?
-Hopefully a solid lead on Bart.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.125
Where are Victor and AC?

25:58.098 --> 26:01.135
I guess we're not that good
at the whole secret part of this yet.

26:01.310 --> 26:04.052
Yeah, but you're great
at getting caught by the villain.

26:05.439 --> 26:08.852
Anyway, I think Bart's being held
at a place called the Ridge Facility.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.186
That's down by the docks.

26:10.361 --> 26:13.853
It's on our list of possible 33.1 targets.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.195
All right, boys, you know the drill.
Let's gear up and get out.

26:22.373 --> 26:23.988
Oh, no.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.246
What now?

26:26.961 --> 26:29.293
Lead shielding.
This isn't just for Bart.

26:29.463 --> 26:33.001
I think the Ridge Facility is being used
to reﬁne meteor rock.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.461
Clark's in trouble.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.683
Green Arrow to Watch Tower.
We're in position.

27:33.861 --> 27:37.854
Okay. There should be a security
access panel near the east door.

27:39.241 --> 27:42.529
According to the schematic, you
need to carefully rewire the system--

27:42.703 --> 27:43.738
Or...

27:45.497 --> 27:48.159
...I could just jack in
and shut the whole perimeter down.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.371
-You can do that?
-Queen Industries upgrade.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.748
Accessing perimeter security.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.927
Perimeter neutralized.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.056
Aquaman, you're up.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.476
Perimeter breached.
Proceeding to target.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.444
You make one hell of a can opener.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.284
And you'd look good
on a bag of green beans.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.866
All right, we're in.
Which way?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.536
The reﬁnement vault's
a hundred meters southwest.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.626
-Still no word from Clark.
-If he's in there, we'll get him out.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.463
-Let's go.
-You've got a different mission.

28:42.596 --> 28:46.384
-You're the boss, Robin Hood.
-What mission? What are you doing?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.732
Watch Tower to Green Arrow,
what's your status?

29:05.744 --> 29:09.157
Switching to Silent Running.
Stand by for instructions.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.365
Aquaman, do your thing.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.772
Hey. You're not supposed to be here.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.409
Neither am I.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.788
All right. Come on.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.955
-l'm all right. Yeah.
-You sure?

30:01.508 --> 30:02.748
Green Arrow to Watch Tower.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.212
Boy Scout's out of the woods.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.044
Boy Scout?

30:08.223 --> 30:10.805
If you hadn't ran off,
you could've picked your own name.

30:10.976 --> 30:14.059
You don't wanna play for the team,
that's ﬁne. Be smart about it.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.560
Point taken.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.938
-Where's Bart?
-lmpulse.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.724
He didn't get to pick
his own code name either.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.567
Watch Tower will guide you to where
he's probably being held.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.232
What are you gonna be doing?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.907
What I do best.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.002
Watch Tower to Boy Scout,
let's ﬁnd Impulse.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.595
Cyborg to Aquaman.
Where the hell are you, Fish Stick?

30:59.900 --> 31:01.606
Dude, what took you so long?

31:01.777 --> 31:05.065
Nice. But please, put a shirt on.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.901
-l swim faster when I'm naked.
-I bet you do.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.940
You're lucky I still got my pants on.

31:35.477 --> 31:38.184
Boy Scout's located Impulse.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.373
Bart. You okay?

32:05.507 --> 32:09.625
I don't care. I want a Level One
Iockdown. No one gets in or out.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.464
Little late for that.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.221
You got 10 minutes to clear
your people out of here...

32:15.392 --> 32:17.383
...before I blow this place off the map.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.560
-You.
-You remember.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.897
-l'm touched.
-Well, it's a little hard to forget.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.184
Last time we met,
you put an arrow in my chest.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.980
You put a bullet in mine. Bygones?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.569
Go to hell.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.069
You ﬁrst.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.547
Can you superspeed?

32:56.725 --> 32:59.057
Yeah, ljust-- I need a minute
to catch my breath.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.718
You know what, you're gonna
have to catch it later.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.683
Aquaman, Cyborg.

33:03.857 --> 33:06.564
-Rendezvous Alpha, conﬁrm.
-We're on the move.

33:06.735 --> 33:09.568
Watch Tower. Have all of
Luthor's people cleared the building?

33:09.738 --> 33:12.946
The last heat signatures
are moving away from the north.

33:13.116 --> 33:16.074
Wait a second. What are you doing?

33:16.244 --> 33:18.951
What do you think? You want
more of your friends in here?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.534
Yeah, I'm voting no on that one.

33:25.128 --> 33:28.541
Watch Tower, are you sure
everyone's out of the building?

33:28.715 --> 33:31.206
One hundred percent positive.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.094
All right, let's do it.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.460
All right, have the jet fueled and ready.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.630
I wanna be in the air
as soon as possible.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.470
Hey. I hope your bird's
got some serious lift...

34:22.644 --> 34:24.885
...because this thing weighs a ton.

34:26.523 --> 34:29.481
Aren't you packed yet?
Where's your stuff?

34:31.862 --> 34:33.352
Lois....

34:34.906 --> 34:37.818
Don't even think about saying
what I think you're gonna say.

34:39.995 --> 34:44.284
I'm sorry. I have to go away
on business.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.754
Postpone it.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.593
It's not that simple.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.259
Nothing with you ever is.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.387
You're like
two completely different people.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.773
There's the charming, romantic guy
that I fell in love with...

35:11.943 --> 35:13.808
...and then there's this other guy...

35:13.987 --> 35:17.821
...who can't stick around in one place
long enough to see what he's missing.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.658
Ever since my parents died...

35:27.042 --> 35:32.582
...l've jumped around from city to city,
from continent to continent.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.834
And in all those years...

35:38.345 --> 35:40.961
...not once have I regretted
leaving anyone.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.716
But then I met you.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.901
Then stay.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.075
I can't.

36:06.915 --> 36:10.749
Because there are more important
things in this world than what I want.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.543
And what I love.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.210
I hope someday I can explain why.

36:22.973 --> 36:26.761
Don't expect me to be waiting around
for that when you get back.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.974
I'm not coming back, Lois.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.901
At least not anytime soon.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.495
I'm
sorry

36:59.801 --> 37:02.133
I never wanted to hurt you.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.097
Well, you ﬁnally got around to it
anyway, didn't you?

37:11.813 --> 37:14.304
This is the moment, right?

37:14.482 --> 37:17.815
The moment that I'm gonna regret
for the rest of my life, isn't it?

37:19.029 --> 37:20.485
Yes.

37:54.064 --> 37:57.682
Bart Allen gone, he escaped.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.817
A multimillion-dollar installation
destroyed.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.854
33.1, irrevocably compromised.

38:04.991 --> 38:08.108
But at least you found out, son,
that the, Jolly Green Archer...

38:08.286 --> 38:09.901
...and his extraordinary cohorts...

38:10.080 --> 38:12.366
...they're not your
run-of-the-mill adversaries.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.533
Which is exactly why
we have to continue with 33.1.

38:16.753 --> 38:20.086
If terrorists like Green Arrow
are recruiting people with abilities...

38:20.256 --> 38:23.965
...the only way to protect freedom
and democracy is to ﬁght ﬁre with ﬁre.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.841
Freedom and democracy? Well, well.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.298
I hadn't realized your goals
were quite so lofty.

38:28.473 --> 38:32.057
Well, there's a lot that escapes your
attention in your declining years, Dad.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.058
But not mine.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.221
The security footage from
the Ridge Facility was destroyed.

38:37.399 --> 38:40.891
However, several guards described
one of Green Arrow's men...

38:41.069 --> 38:45.108
...as someone that sounded
remarkably like Clark Kent.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.989
Clark? Impossible.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.867
A word that always seems to pop up
when talking about him.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.154
Lex, it was not Clark.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.663
How can you be so sure?

38:55.834 --> 38:59.201
Because I was having dinner with him
last night when all this happened.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.544
Martha made pot roast...

39:02.716 --> 39:05.128
...with new potatoes and
tiny little baby carrots.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.343
Clark had three helpings.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.387
But don't worry, son.

39:11.558 --> 39:15.597
You still have plenty of enemies
out there, plotting your downfall.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.731
Okay, thanks.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.112
So the Daily Planet
is running with the story...

39:28.283 --> 39:31.400
...that a gas explosion destroyed
the vacant LuthorCorp building...

39:31.578 --> 39:33.489
...down by the docks.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.570
Vacant?

39:35.749 --> 39:37.865
The Luthor cover-up machine
is in full swing.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.702
Well, at least we got Bart out before
Lex ran him into an early grave.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.869
Oh, come on.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.039
No worries. I had plenty of juice left.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.128
Could've fooled me, the way
you cleaned out Mama Kent's fridge.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.339
Well, it's because I like to stay
fueled up.

39:52.307 --> 39:56.016
Just in case I need to spring
into action.

39:56.478 --> 39:57.809
I still have a boyfriend.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.095
Yeah, well, a man can dream, can't he?

40:00.273 --> 40:02.138
Now you know why we call him Impulse.

40:04.194 --> 40:05.775
Impulse, Cyborg...

40:05.945 --> 40:08.322
...Aquaman, Green Arrow,
what do you call your team?

40:08.490 --> 40:11.106
I don't know. I've been thinking.
We need something cool.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.615
We need something like--

40:12.786 --> 40:15.573
I was thinking about something
with the word "justice" in it.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.204
After all, that's what Lex
is gonna get a big dose of.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.207
Victor and AC were able to hack
into the 33.1 mainframe...

40:21.377 --> 40:22.913
...before we blew the building.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.953
That was your other mission.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.668
Haven't met the computer yet
I couldn't crack wide open.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.173
What'd you guys ﬁnd out?

40:29.344 --> 40:32.006
Lex isn't satisﬁed playing
in his own backyard anymore.

40:32.847 --> 40:36.715
LuthorCorp is starting up divisions
of 33.1 all across the globe.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.017
Wherever there's evidence of people
with abilities...

40:40.188 --> 40:42.304
...there'll be laboratories
to do experiments.

40:42.482 --> 40:43.847
We can't let that happen.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.349
We won't.

40:46.778 --> 40:51.112
Gentleman, our ﬁrst target is a large
facility on the island of Corto Maltese.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.944
You guys know the drill.
Wheels up in 30 minutes.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.030
Get your gear.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.987
You coming, amigo?

40:59.165 --> 41:02.282
-Yeah, you gotta come with us, man.
-We could use the big guns.

41:04.504 --> 41:07.621
They're right, you know?
You'd be a major asset to the team.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.384
I wanna be a part of this, guys.
I really do.

41:13.555 --> 41:15.136
But?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.639
That problem I told you about...

41:18.810 --> 41:21.643
...the one that I caused.
I have to take care of that ﬁrst.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.646
This isn't the end of the story, Clark.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.354
This is just the beginning.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.411
Chloe.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.451
Come on, boys.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.163
Let's go save the world.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.131
You know, you have some pretty
amazing friends, Clark Kent.

41:52.302 --> 41:54.964
Yeah. I do.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.464
