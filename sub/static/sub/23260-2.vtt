- A little.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.010

That's so sweet.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.186
But I can come join you

12:32.229 --> 12:33.927
downstairs
and we can eat together.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.798
- Well, we kind of let you
sleep in a little bit.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.844
It's almost 8:00.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.584
Oh, shoot.
We got to get you to school.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.891
- No, no, it's okay.
I can take him there.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.588
You relax.
Enjoy your breakfast.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.634
Come on, scout.
Let's let your mom eat.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.897
- Hey.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.421
Thanks.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.859
- Not even close to a problem.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.435
I've been worried sick.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.002
You never came home.
I tried calling.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.352
You didn't picked up.
- My phone died.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.702
- And sign this as well,
please.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.836
- I'm taking my mother
out of here.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.882
- Okay.
Why?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.927
- I'm bringing her home.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.494
- Wait.
What?

13:19.537 --> 13:21.713
Are you serious?
- I am, come here.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.803
That doesn't make any sense.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.587
- Look,
I have to dream with her.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.676
- You promised you wouldn't.
- No, I said

13:27.719 --> 13:30.026
you wouldn't lose me in
the dream world, and you won't.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.723
- You have no idea
what could happen.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.161
Please, I...I don't want you
to end up in a coma.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.859
You can't--
- I've already done it.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.992
I dreamt with my mother
last night.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.863
Okay?
Something is happening.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.517
In the dream world.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.735
And I think it may be connected

13:43.779 --> 13:45.999
to this case I'm working on.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.219
- In a way, yeah.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.873
She showed me in our dream.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.488
This woman who,
by your own admission,

13:57.532 --> 13:59.577
has been manipulating
and abusing you

13:59.621 --> 14:01.275
since you were a child.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.406
Suddenly now,
because of a dream,

14:02.450 --> 14:03.712
you're going
to trust her?

14:03.755 --> 14:05.453
- Look, it's a chance
I have to take.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.282
- Right, yeah, because
she's been such a good mother.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.980
Even when she's a goddamn
vegetable lying in bed,

14:11.024 --> 14:12.764
she's trying to find ways
to hurt you.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.201
- This isn't about my mother.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.898
- It is!

14:15.942 --> 14:18.205
She just can't handle the fact
that her little boy

14:18.248 --> 14:19.946
finally has a life--
- Okay, shut up!

14:24.037 --> 14:27.214
I should have consulted you,
I know.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.085
But the bottom line is this:

14:29.129 --> 14:31.174
I am bringing her home.

14:31.218 --> 14:34.525
With or without your support.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.223
- I see.

14:36.266 --> 14:40.227
Thank you for being
so considerate of my feelings.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.359
- Sabine.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.933
- When you first elected me
to serve as your mayor,

14:50.977 --> 14:52.369
my opponents claimed
we couldn't afford

14:52.413 --> 14:54.937
to rebuild our
crumbling infrastructure.

14:54.981 --> 14:58.723
Well, here we stand
four years later.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.682
And, thanks to our revitalized

15:00.725 --> 15:03.337
bridges, roads,
and rail systems,

15:03.380 --> 15:06.035
New York's economy is surging
to new heights.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.562
Yes!

15:16.045 --> 15:19.440

As you know, my opponent,
Phil Whittaker...

15:23.226 --> 15:25.663
Has been gaining in the polls.

Are we going to let him
beat us?

15:27.535 --> 15:29.972
all: No.
- Hell no.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.322
- Then please,
open your checkbooks

15:32.366 --> 15:35.108
and help me win a second term.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.981
Thank you.

Oh, thank you.

for everything that you've done

15:53.735 --> 15:57.652

tonight was incandescent.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.349
- Incandescent.

I've been called many things
but never that.

I didn't mean to
sound like a gushing fanboy.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.008

16:06.052 --> 16:08.968
I could use it after a steady
diet of Whittaker's attack ads.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.752
- Yeah, but that jerk would
send this city

16:10.795 --> 16:13.189
back to the dark ages.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.887
That's why I would like
to offer you my support.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.854
- That's very generous of you,
Mr. Hammond.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.377

back together again.
