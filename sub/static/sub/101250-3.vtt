WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.851
-[bell ringing]
-[people shouting]

00:19.352 --> 00:21.813
[Merlin] Have you any idea
what you've done?

00:22.147 --> 00:26.443
I knew my apprentice was an ignoramus,
but traveling through time?

00:26.526 --> 00:27.360
Time!

00:27.444 --> 00:30.196
I think we handled ourselves just fine,
all things considered.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.240
And, technically, it was <i>your</i> idea.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.160
Well, then, you must have botched it up!

00:35.243 --> 00:37.203
My planning is flawless.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.873
For the record, Master,
I had nothing to do with this.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.542
He did, which is me, and... ugh!

00:42.625 --> 00:44.377
Time travel, so confusing!

00:45.628 --> 00:49.466
Aah! The timelines
are in complete disarray!

00:49.549 --> 00:51.718
Look, I can fix this, I swear!

00:51.801 --> 00:56.097
Ah-ah, your meddling has already
wreaked enough havoc on history.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.017
Then surely we can use the Time Map
to change things back,

00:59.100 --> 01:00.602
and then it'll all be as it was.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.645
It doesn't work that way.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.024
The map only offers glimpses
of possible futures.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.568
There are no detailed instructions.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.487
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.404
[grunts]

01:12.030 --> 01:13.782
Aah! By my beard!

01:14.032 --> 01:15.533
Not that bad, eh?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.119
-Oh, fuzz buckets!
-Fuzz buckets!

01:18.411 --> 01:21.623
Your little dungeon break
must have changed fate.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.751
Now, unless I stop it, the king will die!

01:25.877 --> 01:28.088
[Douxie whistling tune]

01:28.171 --> 01:29.672
[theme music playing]

01:59.035 --> 02:01.037
Your sister, as requested, my lord.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.455
Why have I been summoned?

02:02.539 --> 02:06.417
The beasts in the dungeon have escaped,
aided by shadow magic.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.419
Curious coincidence, hmm?

02:08.503 --> 02:13.216
I was in my quarters all night,
being a good little indentured sorceress.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.094
The creatures were seen fleeing
into the Wild Woods.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.804
You will help take them down.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.264
What? Why?

02:19.347 --> 02:21.224
Consider it a test of loyalty.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.019
Bring me their heads or yours will be
on the chopping block next.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.148
[shouts] When you get the chance,
you do it.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.358
-Boom, like that!
-[Steve] Onion brew?

02:30.733 --> 02:32.610
[burps] Ah, nectar from heaven!

02:32.694 --> 02:35.738
-I'm gonna make you knight-dudes so proud!
-[cow moos]

02:35.822 --> 02:40.535
Today, we hunt down every last beast
who dared defy Arthur's law!

02:40.618 --> 02:42.996
-Hip, hip!
-[knights] Huzzah!

02:43.079 --> 02:45.665
They're hunting Jim!
If they catch him, he'll be killed!

02:45.832 --> 02:47.333
I know, and he's not the only one.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.461
Because of us, Arthur's now fated
to eat the big one, too!

02:50.545 --> 02:52.714
Eat the what?
Oh, no, was I supposed to bring food?

02:52.797 --> 02:56.301
-He'll be eating a death sandwich, Steve.
-Ugh, who would eat that? Gross.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.552
[groans] Look.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.972
If Arthur dies, we lose
the Battle of Killahead

03:01.389 --> 03:02.849
and the war.

03:02.932 --> 03:07.562
Which will probably mess up time so much,
you'll never be able to return home.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.023
Oh, no! Toby!

03:10.440 --> 03:14.193
-What's happening to him?
-The future-- our future is vanishing!

03:15.987 --> 03:18.740
-What's that?
-Well-- Well, that wasn't there before.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.534
It's a new timeline,
one where Arthur and Jim live.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.994
And Morgana's the hero?

03:23.077 --> 03:25.872
I thought she was destined
to become Mistress Doom.

03:25.955 --> 03:30.919
It looks like there's a possibility,
if we get Arthur and Morgana to reconcile,

03:31.002 --> 03:32.629
then, somehow, nobody dies.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.755
[Galahad] Squire Steve!

03:33.838 --> 03:35.882
-[horse neighs]
-[Galahad] We are all thirsty!

03:35.965 --> 03:38.635
I'll keep an eye on Morgana.
Douxie, you work on Arthur.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.012
And, Steve, make sure
they don't kill my boyfriend.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.139
Okay, Arch, let's save history-- Whoa!

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
[Merlin] Oh, no, you don't, boy.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.018
[Douxie] But, Master Merlin, I can help!

03:47.101 --> 03:48.853
I'm 900 years smarter, tougher--

03:48.937 --> 03:51.481
Nine hundred years crazier, clearly.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.692
I must focus on protecting
the king's life.

03:54.859 --> 03:59.822
So I'm taking an apprentice
who won't mess up the fabric of time.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.407
L-Let's do this, Master!

04:01.491 --> 04:04.369
Him? But he's just a moppet
with a man bun!

04:04.452 --> 04:07.664
Someone's just jealous
they don't get to ride on the horse.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
-[horse farts]
-Oh!

04:08.831 --> 04:10.124
[fanfare plays]

04:10.208 --> 04:14.003
It's time we root out
every last enemy in our lands.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.964
-[knight] Hyah!
-[horse neighs]

04:16.089 --> 04:17.298
[grunts, groans]

04:18.049 --> 04:18.883
[exhales]

04:19.259 --> 04:22.804
-[Arthur] Death to all Trolls!
-[knights] Death to all Trolls!

04:22.887 --> 04:27.725
Let's get out there, boys,
and rip their faces off!

04:27.809 --> 04:30.270
-Medieval Bessie, go!
-[bell clanging]

04:30.353 --> 04:32.730
-Ho-ho! Cow-ho!
-[moos]

04:32.814 --> 04:35.108
What a beautiful day for a ride.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.651
It just makes you want to--

04:37.110 --> 04:37.944
Huh?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.446
[snoring] Yes, Mummy, it tickles.

04:40.530 --> 04:44.742
You do know that repeat sleep spells
can cause memory loss permanently.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.744
Huh, don't remember that. No matter.

04:46.995 --> 04:47.870
[grunts]

04:47.954 --> 04:50.456
-Let's go! The king needs us!
-[horse neighs]

04:55.295 --> 04:58.756
[panting, groaning]

04:59.340 --> 05:00.216
[sizzling]

05:00.466 --> 05:01.342
Aah!

05:01.426 --> 05:02.885
[coughs, pants]

05:03.428 --> 05:04.554
Whoa.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.514
[Callista] Yes! We made it to the border!

05:10.393 --> 05:12.103
[birds calling]

05:12.854 --> 05:13.938
That's Killahead.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.693
Yeah, yeah.
Big, scary name for a puny, little bridge.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.571
River's been dry for years.
At this point, it's a bridge over nothing.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.323
My friends were supposed
to find us by now.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.574
Something must have happened.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.118
You guys need to get to safety.
[groaning]

05:27.201 --> 05:28.202
Whoa, take it easy.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.829
-You're still in rough shape.
-[winces]

05:29.912 --> 05:31.706
I'll be all right.
You should go on ahead, too.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.500
And leave you here to die
and haunt my night dreams? No, thanks.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.210
I don't get why you trust
those humans.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.962
You'll see. We're not all bad.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.256
-You just gotta give us a chance.
-[fanfare plays]

05:40.340 --> 05:42.258
-[men shouting]
-Ugh, a chance to what?

05:42.341 --> 05:45.803
See? Those humans are coming
to turn your head into a wall decoration.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.138
Everybody, hide!

05:48.723 --> 05:51.768
-[distant shouting]
-[Jim panting]

05:51.851 --> 05:53.144
[knight] Tally-ho!

05:53.561 --> 05:55.605
[horse neighs, sputters]

05:56.230 --> 05:57.065
[whimpers]

06:01.319 --> 06:02.153
[whimpers]

06:03.071 --> 06:04.030
-[fart squeaks]
-Oh!

06:09.077 --> 06:10.411
We can't let them find the others.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.288
They'll lead them
straight to our village.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.748
No-good fleshbags.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.541
-We gotta distract them.
-Oh, you're right.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
Aah! Oh, he-hello!

06:17.835 --> 06:18.795
[growls]

06:19.087 --> 06:20.713
-Get them!
-[horse neighs]

06:21.464 --> 06:23.091
I can't believe you pushed me!

06:23.424 --> 06:24.884
[Arthur] Faster, men! Faster!

06:24.967 --> 06:27.220
Come on!
We'll lose them in the Wild Wood!

06:27.303 --> 06:29.388
[knight] Yes! Now they're going this way!

06:30.014 --> 06:32.266
-[Steve] Medieval steed, ho!
-[cow moos]

06:32.350 --> 06:33.684
At-- At your leisure.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.187
[Douxie] Merlin, you have to look
at the Time Map!

06:36.270 --> 06:37.146
-We found--
-You!

06:37.230 --> 06:41.234
You defy my command
when the king's life is in jeopardy?

06:41.317 --> 06:45.571
Need I remind you that we trespass
in Gunmar's territory?

06:45.655 --> 06:48.533
But, Master, I found a new line of fate!

06:48.616 --> 06:51.369
We can save everyone
if we get Arthur and Morgana--

06:51.744 --> 06:52.954
-Whoa! Whoa! Oh!
-[neighs]

06:54.997 --> 06:57.458
-[knights murmuring]
-[horse neighs]

06:58.543 --> 07:00.002
Come on. Now's our chance.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.963
They've entered the Wild Wood.

07:02.046 --> 07:02.964
Abandon the horses.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.549
We head on foot!

07:05.299 --> 07:08.970
-[horse nickers]
-Changing fate is never that simple.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.513
I'll deal with you later.

07:10.596 --> 07:14.976
What's most important
is that I keep Arthur safe from harm.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.311
Okay, good chat, sir!

07:17.478 --> 07:19.272
Forget him. Stick to the plan.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.190
-I'll take the king.
-I'll cover Morgana.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.777
And let's just focus on getting
these royal siblings to hug and make up.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.280
-[Claire] And not die.
-[Archie] Uh, yes, that, too.

07:28.030 --> 07:28.948
[creature shrieks]

07:29.031 --> 07:31.325
[clears throat]
Eh, enjoying the hunt, milord?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.035
[sighs] You again, boy?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.621
No. I'll feel better
after dealing with my sister.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.958
Wouldn't you say life's too short
to hold grudges?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.001
[growls]

07:40.084 --> 07:41.711
[chuckles] I mean...

07:41.794 --> 07:43.588
family's so important, isn't it?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.257
You're lucky that you've got one.
Closest I ever got was him.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.383
[coughs]

07:47.467 --> 07:48.634
-Hmm.
-[Douxie] Please, sire.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.637
Morgana was only looking out
for those poor creatures.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.974
Is all this really worth hurting her?

07:55.057 --> 07:57.185
-I will speak of this no more!
-[sighs]

07:57.602 --> 07:59.020
[knight] Keep an eye out.

07:59.228 --> 08:03.191
-Ugh, my brother has eyes everywhere.
-He's just looking out for you.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.442
Can you blame him?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.819
He's already accused me of betrayal.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.362
I lost my brother once.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.156
You don't appreciate them
till they're gone.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.993
-Maybe if you just talked?
-Pfft, look where that last talk got us.

08:14.076 --> 08:17.371
Please, of everyone here,
you're the only one I can trust.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.665
Me? What made him stop trusting you?

08:19.749 --> 08:20.833
It's a long story.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.043
Come on.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.629
[knight] No sign of them, sire.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.713
Trail's gone cold.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.256
[owl hoots]

08:27.465 --> 08:30.051
Mm, not much love left between them.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.304
If only you could make him remember
the good old days.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.390
-[meows]
-Maybe I can.

08:37.391 --> 08:42.021
Say, my liege, didn't you used
to spend time in this wood?

08:42.104 --> 08:42.939
Yes.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.565
As a boy.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.610
Much time was lost
in this accursed forest.

08:47.944 --> 08:52.156
I often fled to these woods to escape
from my growing responsibilities.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.783
-[whirs]
-[gasps]

08:58.871 --> 09:01.374
[knight 1] On your guard, men!
We've been bewitched!

09:01.457 --> 09:02.708
[knight 2] What's happening?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.419
-It's coming for me!
-[disembodied laughter echoing]

09:05.503 --> 09:07.088
[knight 2] It's dark magic!

09:07.463 --> 09:09.632
[scoffs] Stand down.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.300
We're not in danger.

09:11.425 --> 09:12.635
Uh, my lord...

09:15.096 --> 09:16.097
[Arthur] Gwen.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.058
-[exhales] My betrothed.
-[children laughing]

09:19.350 --> 09:20.601
My beloved.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.895
She was the heart of me.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.279
Mm, we loved these woods.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.030
The freedom they offered.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.034
The wood showed us kindness
for our courage.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.122
Gwen and I were never scared.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.456
Arthur, however...

09:42.999 --> 09:46.127
I knew what danger lurked in the darkness.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.086
Gwen!

09:47.169 --> 09:48.796
Away from her, demon!

09:49.130 --> 09:51.966
[Arthur] As we grew older
and duty kept me inside,

09:52.049 --> 09:53.926
Morgana encouraged Gwen,

09:54.010 --> 09:57.513
brought her out when she should have
stayed safe within Camelot.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.641
Arthur always blamed me
for our moonlight trips.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.894
But that night, it was Gwen
pulling me out of the door.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.149
We'd stumbled into a Stalkling nest.

10:09.066 --> 10:09.900
Gwen!

10:10.484 --> 10:12.278
-[snarling]
-[Morgana] It was afraid.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.281
-[yelps]
-[roars]

10:15.364 --> 10:16.532
[screams]

10:16.824 --> 10:20.369
That night, Gwen went into the woods
and never returned.

10:21.787 --> 10:25.124
[sighs] You, sister,
should have known better.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.169
You never forgave me.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.174
And when my own gifts blossomed,
you saw yet another abomination.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.719
Ordered Merlin to teach me
to control that part of me...

10:38.095 --> 10:40.598
though Gwen loved magic as I did.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.644
Yes. Yes, she did.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.270
[Arthur gasps]

10:47.104 --> 10:47.938
[Arthur] I...

10:48.105 --> 10:49.982
I miss her terribly.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.400
As do I...

10:52.818 --> 10:53.653
brother.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.535
It's working!

11:01.619 --> 11:04.121
Troll! We found one!

11:04.205 --> 11:08.000
[growls] I will lose no one else
to those creatures.

11:08.084 --> 11:08.918
To arms!

11:09.126 --> 11:11.003
No, no, no, no, no! Not now!

11:11.087 --> 11:12.046
Oh, no! Jim!

11:12.213 --> 11:14.799
Steady, men! Remember your training.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.842
-Kill the beast!
-Wait, kill?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.719
I thought this was catch-and-release!

11:19.053 --> 11:21.055
Using magic? On the king?

11:21.138 --> 11:22.139
Are you mad?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.809
Come, we must protect Arthur.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.144
[knights murmuring]

11:28.729 --> 11:29.688
[knights murmuring]

11:29.772 --> 11:31.107
[Troll growling]

11:35.236 --> 11:36.112
[Troll grunts]

11:36.487 --> 11:38.823
-[roaring]
-[shouts]

11:38.906 --> 11:40.491
Take the beast down!

11:40.783 --> 11:41.867
Arthur, no!

11:42.326 --> 11:43.160
[Troll grunts]

11:43.702 --> 11:46.622
-Squire Steve, will you do the honors?
-[whimpers]

11:47.039 --> 11:48.207
-[roars]
-[yelps]

11:48.290 --> 11:49.291
-[shouts]
-[grunts]

11:49.375 --> 11:51.752
Careful, young squire.
Show these beasts no sympathy.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.129
-[shouts]
-[groans]

11:53.671 --> 11:55.923
[hissing]

11:56.132 --> 11:57.883
[all] Huzzah! Huzzah!

11:58.092 --> 12:00.594
-[whimpering]
-[snarling]

12:00.928 --> 12:01.804
[screams]

12:02.179 --> 12:03.013
[roars]

12:04.306 --> 12:08.185
-Bular the Butcher!
-The Gumm-Gumm prince himself!

12:08.477 --> 12:11.230
[all grunting]

12:13.566 --> 12:15.484
[laughing] Oh...

12:16.152 --> 12:18.404
[Galahad] Come on,
let's see what you're-- [shouts]

12:18.487 --> 12:20.364
[Bular shouting]

12:20.990 --> 12:21.907
For Camelot!

12:22.700 --> 12:26.745
I'll drink your blood
out of a goblet made of your skull!

12:27.746 --> 12:29.498
[Bular shouting]

12:29.582 --> 12:31.834
[Arthur groaning]

12:33.085 --> 12:36.380
I'll carve you open,
let your guts spill out!

12:36.672 --> 12:38.632
-My king!
-Arthur!

12:39.467 --> 12:41.177
-[Arthur grunts]
-[Bular] Huh?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.180
[grunting] There's no spilling
anything today!

12:44.388 --> 12:46.390
[shouting, grunts]

12:46.599 --> 12:48.934
[strains] Finish it, then, fleshbag!

12:49.143 --> 12:51.645
[Arthur] The spawn of Gunmar.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.148
-I won't dull Excalibur's edge with you.
-[thuds]

12:54.231 --> 12:56.984
-[Bular grunts]
-Drag this monster back to Camelot!

12:57.067 --> 12:59.028
I have plans for him.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.864
The rest, with me!
My blade hungers.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.616
[Lancelot] As you wish, milord. Onward!

13:03.991 --> 13:05.826
Who's the monster here?

13:06.243 --> 13:07.536
[caws]

13:08.120 --> 13:11.373
Huh, these tracks are fresh!
The other beasts can't be far, milord.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.626
-Best we spread out, flank them!
-Go.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.920
And, you, time to pick a side.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.298
You would do well not to return
with a clean sword.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.386
We gotta slow these fleshbags down,
or we'll end up statues in Arthur's hall.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.638
[panting]

13:25.721 --> 13:27.681
Try and keep up!
We're taking a detour.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.807
Hold!

13:29.225 --> 13:30.351
[creature chitter]

13:30.643 --> 13:32.269
-What are those?
-[clunks]

13:32.561 --> 13:33.646
-Ah!
-Oh.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.814
You know Trolls--
we like to protect our homes.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.566
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

13:37.650 --> 13:40.110
Those fleshbags would have to be stupid
to follow us now.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.278
You don't know Steve.

13:43.113 --> 13:43.948
[chuckles]

13:44.031 --> 13:47.034
This area is dangerous,
but there's no way around.

13:47.701 --> 13:51.372
[clears throat] Fear not,
for Steve will scout the enemy base.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.957
Hold, Squire. Watch out for the--

13:53.040 --> 13:53.916
-Ha ha!
-[clunks]

13:54.166 --> 13:56.252
-Ow! [whimpering]
-[Galahad] Oh!

13:56.669 --> 13:57.586
-Ow!
-[knights] Oh!

13:58.754 --> 14:00.381
[Steve screaming]

14:00.464 --> 14:02.800
-[laughing]
-[screaming continues]

14:02.883 --> 14:04.134
[groans]

14:04.218 --> 14:07.638
-[Galahad] That one's gotta hurt!
-Well done, Squire Steve!

14:07.721 --> 14:09.723
-Now the path's clear.
-[slurring] I love you guys.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.684
You guys are my best friends.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.645
-[knight shouts]
-Lousy smoothskins just keep coming.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.022
So, how'd you know about the traps?

14:17.106 --> 14:17.940
'Cause...

14:18.607 --> 14:19.567
I used to live here.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.652
[bird squawking]

14:21.735 --> 14:23.862
[Callista] This is Tombro, my home.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.656
Or what's left of it.

14:26.073 --> 14:29.118
It's, uh... nice.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.245
It was.

14:31.453 --> 14:35.165
You know, "great" King Arthur,
always expanding his borders.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.085
I was just a youngling
when the knights sacked the village,

14:38.168 --> 14:41.297
caught me, gave me
my human name: Callista.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.883
Never knew my Troll name,
my real one.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.093
You know, usual story.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.263
Callista, I'm so sorry.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.474
There'll be time to lick our wounds
when those pinkbellies aren't hunting us.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.561
You know, where I'm from,
humans and Trolls get along.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.688
[laughs] And where's that again?

14:57.771 --> 14:59.690
Prepare to have your mind blown.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.568
Look! People and Trolls, working together.

15:02.651 --> 15:06.196
-They don't have to fight.
-Oh! Who's the one with the baby hands?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.698
Must be the runt of the litter.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.116
He was tall for his age!

15:09.491 --> 15:10.993
But you see? They're not all bad.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.163
Shh, I've got one in my sights.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.623
This one's sort of sweet.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.792
Uh, oh, no, what do I do, what do I do?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.169
Such conflict.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.254
Oh, snap! Uh... mosquito!

15:22.713 --> 15:24.298
-[Callista grunts]
-Clumsy jackanape!

15:24.381 --> 15:26.383
-Callista!
-[grunts] Run, now!

15:26.467 --> 15:28.761
-[Steve] Oh, no! Another mosquito!
-Aah!

15:30.220 --> 15:31.221
[panting]

15:32.139 --> 15:33.265
[groans]

15:34.141 --> 15:36.894
[panting, groaning]
Let's go! Hurry it up!

15:37.519 --> 15:38.354
Jim?

15:39.188 --> 15:41.273
-Jim!
-[groaning]

15:41.440 --> 15:42.274
Callista!

15:42.608 --> 15:43.442
Where are you?

15:43.734 --> 15:45.194
-[panting]
-[Claire] Jim!

15:45.569 --> 15:47.112
-Jim!
-[Troll snarls]

15:47.321 --> 15:50.032
-[grunts]
-What if we let this one go?

15:50.115 --> 15:51.700
You never let them go!

15:51.784 --> 15:52.701
Rally, men!

15:52.785 --> 15:55.371
Whoever gets that Troll gets a fiefdom!

15:55.454 --> 15:58.040
-Huzzah!
-[knights] Huzzah!

15:58.123 --> 15:58.958
Uh...

15:59.333 --> 16:01.335
-Wait!
-My king, it's not safe!

16:01.585 --> 16:02.920
-Oh, no.
-Come, handmaiden.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.046
Not a moment to lose.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.923
What are you gonna do if we catch them?

16:06.006 --> 16:07.257
Whatever I have to.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.176
[gasps] Jim!

16:09.885 --> 16:11.679
[panting]

16:11.762 --> 16:14.890
Aah! [grunting]

16:14.974 --> 16:16.850
[coughing]

16:16.934 --> 16:20.270
-[shouts] There you are.
-[panting] Morgana?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.689
Jim! Jim!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.399
[Jim panting]

16:24.108 --> 16:26.026
-[shouts]
-[Morgana] Don't be afraid.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.027
I won't hurt you.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.362
[Claire] Jim!

16:28.445 --> 16:30.030
Don't kill him! You said--

16:30.114 --> 16:32.700
-[groans, gasps]
-I'm sorry you were ever in a cage.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.243
-[moans]
-[sighs]

16:34.827 --> 16:36.453
-[gasps]
-Down in the clearing!

16:36.537 --> 16:38.539
Go. I will draw away the others.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.082
-Go!
-I'll find you.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.003
[groans]

16:45.004 --> 16:46.672
Oof! [gasps]

16:46.755 --> 16:47.881
-Arthur!
-Jim!

16:47.965 --> 16:49.133
So, sister.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.927
Your true loyalties
stand revealed at last.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.597
I warned you not to return
with a clean sword.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.807
No!

16:57.391 --> 16:58.809
What? What are you doing?

16:58.892 --> 17:03.105
-What I should have done years ago.
-You dare raise arms against your king?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.815
[both grunting]

17:05.899 --> 17:07.317
-Run, Jim!
-[groans]

17:07.401 --> 17:09.820
Get back here, you gravel-eater!

17:09.987 --> 17:10.988
No!

17:11.613 --> 17:13.782
What the...? She's a wit-- Oh!

17:14.074 --> 17:15.325
Oh-ho, man!

17:15.409 --> 17:17.911
That Troll-- that came out of nowhere!

17:17.995 --> 17:19.538
-Right, guys?
-[groans]

17:19.621 --> 17:20.622
-Ooh!
-[nervous chuckle]

17:20.706 --> 17:21.540
Go!

17:21.623 --> 17:23.167
-[shouting]
-I knew it was you!

17:23.250 --> 17:27.796
You defied me, freed those monsters,
and now attack your own blood?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.089
What possesses you?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.633
Clarity of mind, brother. [shouts]

17:32.092 --> 17:33.177
Morgana?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.012
She takes Arthur's life.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.930
No, no! No, wait, wait!

17:37.222 --> 17:39.475
We don't have to figh-- Oh!

17:39.558 --> 17:40.392
[grunting]

17:40.476 --> 17:42.728
Defend the king at all costs!

17:43.353 --> 17:45.397
[grunts] You, too, old man?

17:45.481 --> 17:48.150
I do what I must for the greater good!

17:48.358 --> 17:49.234
Traitors!

17:49.318 --> 17:52.196
You throw us in chains,
fearing what you cannot control,

17:52.279 --> 17:56.617
but we of magic are not lesser creatures,
we are more!

17:58.077 --> 17:59.745
-[grunts]
-[all shout]

17:59.828 --> 18:01.997
Stop! We found another way!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.582
[Douxie] We can do this peacefully!

18:03.665 --> 18:05.959
The time for peace ended long ago.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.087
[Claire] Morgana, he's not the enemy.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.463
I trusted you!

18:09.546 --> 18:12.424
Now you side with my brother
over your own kind?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.759
You're just one of them.

18:13.842 --> 18:17.471
You're all against me,
but I am more powerful than you know.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.057

18:35.697 --> 18:37.866
At least little Jim got away.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.535
[knight] There's another one!

18:39.618 --> 18:41.787
Trying to get away, beastie?

18:42.287 --> 18:43.247
[Jim shouts]

18:44.331 --> 18:45.165
[both shout]

18:45.249 --> 18:48.669
Ugh, why aren't you running, you idiot?
Now we're both gonna die.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.463
I told you before,
no one gets left behind.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.674
[groans] Oh, hey, feelings.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.761

19:01.348 --> 19:02.683
Oh, no way!

19:02.766 --> 19:04.977
Can't get me! Ha ha! [chokes]

19:05.060 --> 19:06.395
-Yah!
-[grunting, screams]

19:06.478 --> 19:09.898
Your cruelty towards magic-kind
knows no bounds!

19:09.982 --> 19:13.235
You have taken and taken,
and now we take back!

19:15.904 --> 19:17.114
Protect the king!

You outlaw magic,
but fight with an enchanted sword!

19:56.403 --> 20:00.824
You snuff out any power that isn't yours,
but I won't go so quietly.

20:00.908 --> 20:05.579
I denied your true nature for so long
because you are my sister.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.540
But when I look at you now,
all I see is a demon!

20:08.707 --> 20:09.666
A witch!

20:09.750 --> 20:10.876
[panting]

20:11.084 --> 20:16.006
And all I see is a little boy driven mad
by hatred and prejudice!

20:19.676 --> 20:21.553
-Goodbye, brother.
-[groans]

20:21.720 --> 20:22.554
Morgana!

20:22.930 --> 20:24.264
No! No, no, no!

20:26.558 --> 20:27.434
[Morgana shrieks]

20:28.101 --> 20:29.645
[whimpering]

20:29.728 --> 20:30.604
No...

20:31.021 --> 20:31.855
Brother?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.150
[gasps, screaming]

20:35.317 --> 20:36.777
-Morgana!
-No!

20:36.860 --> 20:38.528
No!

20:48.038 --> 20:49.039
[shouts]

20:51.917 --> 20:56.213
[Arthur screaming]

20:56.296 --> 20:58.215
[crows caw]

20:58.298 --> 20:59.466
[chains rattling]

20:59.633 --> 21:03.679
Now magic has truly taken
everything from me.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.100
She's gone. We failed.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.851
No, I failed.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.855
Master, I-- I'm so sorry.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.984
This is why you don't meddle with time.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.528
But I tried. I tried to fix it.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.071
Don't you see, boy?

21:21.446 --> 21:23.824
There is no "fixing" anything.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.618
Every change has consequence.

21:26.702 --> 21:31.206
Knowing the future is a responsibility
to bear with caution,

21:31.290 --> 21:34.584
lest you cause worse things to happen.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.005
Morgana's dead, Excalibur's broken.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.381
That never happened.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.842
We are in uncharted territory.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.429
[both panting]

21:45.846 --> 21:47.472
Almost... there.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.309
[both groan]

21:50.600 --> 21:52.894
[both panting]

21:53.312 --> 21:54.313
[groans] Thanks.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.274
You didn't leave me to die, Jim.
[chuckles]

21:57.816 --> 21:59.693
-[both grunt]
-You're in bad shape.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.821
Aah! And, so am I, actually.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.281
Help!

22:04.364 --> 22:06.033
Can somebody help us, please?

22:08.618 --> 22:09.453
[groans]

22:12.122 --> 22:13.373
Blinky?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.292
Blinky?

22:15.375 --> 22:18.503
It's Blinkous Galadrigal to you,
youngling!

22:20.297 --> 22:23.175
