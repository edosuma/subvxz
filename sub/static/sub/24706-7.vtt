. . .l may have been halfway out of line,
what l said.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.366
l'd never dump a case, Andy.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.524
You didn't take me right.
What l meant. . .

24:51.693 --> 24:53.923
. . .the way you felt,
maybe you were going slow. . .

24:54.133 --> 24:56.089
. . .not that you didn't mean
to get there.

24:56.253 --> 24:58.972
You see, when you don't know
someone, you have difficulty. . .

24:59.133 --> 25:02.205
. . .coming to an understanding.

25:02.373 --> 25:04.409
-That's true.
-l worked with the other guy. . .

25:04.613 --> 25:09.050
-. . .for eight years.
-l know, Andy. l know.

25:11.453 --> 25:13.728
Anyways. . . .

25:16.653 --> 25:20.771
Okay, l appreciate you saying that.

25:21.253 --> 25:24.325
You want me to come with you
on this interview or not?

25:25.773 --> 25:27.252
Yeah, l would.

25:27.413 --> 25:29.290
SlPOWlCZ:
Okay.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.483
MARTlNEZ:
Thanks for coming in.

25:38.653 --> 25:41.167
-What else we gotta tell you?
MARTlNEZ: We have questions.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.005
REYNA: What?
-Did you talk to Jennifer?

25:43.173 --> 25:46.131
MARTlNEZ: Take her into 2.
-Hold on, you talk to her with me.

25:46.333 --> 25:47.482
You can't hold us here.

25:47.653 --> 25:49.564
MARTlNEZ:
Would you rather be under arrest?

25:49.733 --> 25:53.646
-Under arrest for what?
-Let's talk, all right?

25:56.573 --> 25:58.768
l know most of the people
Eddie knows.

25:58.933 --> 26:02.369
l mean, l know all the people from
the gym. That's where we met.

26:02.693 --> 26:05.161
-You work out there?
-l did.

26:05.333 --> 26:09.292
Eddie was my personal trainer.
He's the best.

26:09.653 --> 26:13.123
Are you aware that he was
dealing drugs?

26:14.053 --> 26:15.964
That's a lie.

26:16.133 --> 26:19.284
He's totally into health.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.762
Did Jennifer tell you that?

26:22.213 --> 26:23.487
She's a liar.

26:23.653 --> 26:25.883
Have you ever actually spoken
to Jennifer?

26:26.093 --> 26:29.483
No. Eddie doesn't want me
talking to her.

26:29.653 --> 26:32.042
She's crazy.

26:32.733 --> 26:36.123
Let's talk about the time you
got shot at by drug dealers.

26:36.373 --> 26:40.571
l know where this is coming from.

26:40.733 --> 26:45.966
Look, Jennifer is
a very disturbed person.

26:46.133 --> 26:46.693
l mean, you know
the term transference?

26:46.693 --> 26:48.251
l mean, you know
the term transference?

26:48.573 --> 26:51.963
She had a heavy drug problem,
and l was trying to work it out of her. . .

26:52.133 --> 26:55.170
. . .make her understand that her body
was the temple of her soul. . .

26:55.333 --> 26:57.688
. . .and she was destroying it.

26:57.893 --> 27:01.283
-Have you ever been tested for HlV?
-Do l look like l have AlDS?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.284
l'm asking the questions.

27:03.533 --> 27:06.366
l've never been sick a day in my life.
Why should l be tested?

27:06.533 --> 27:07.966
Jennifer is positive.

27:08.173 --> 27:11.290
Well, l'm very sorry to hear that,
but l'm not surprised. . .

27:11.453 --> 27:14.047
-. . .because of her drug problem.
-You're not worried?

27:15.333 --> 27:19.246
While l was with her, she was just
dropping pills, no lV use.

27:19.453 --> 27:21.842
How about Kathy Manning?

27:22.733 --> 27:25.122
Kathy?

27:25.453 --> 27:28.763
l haven't seen Kathy
in three years.

27:29.053 --> 27:30.771
She's dying.

27:30.933 --> 27:34.721
Well, that's too bad,
but it's got nothing to do with me.

27:34.933 --> 27:37.003
You ever hear of reckless endangerment?

27:37.453 --> 27:39.205
Yeah.

27:39.373 --> 27:42.888
And when you say something like that,
l say get me a lawyer or let me leave.

27:43.173 --> 27:45.164
lf you'd seen Eddie
without his shirt on. . .

27:45.333 --> 27:48.325
. . .you'd know there's no way
he's got AlDS.

27:49.213 --> 27:51.329
He told me that bitch
was spreading that rumor.

27:51.533 --> 27:54.252
Have you been tested?

27:54.893 --> 27:58.488
-l don't need to be.
-Have you practiced safe sex?

27:59.093 --> 28:02.165
The kind of sex l've practiced
is none of your business.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.927
Get yourself tested, Dorie,
and protect yourself.

28:06.733 --> 28:08.963
l don't need to.

28:09.133 --> 28:12.523
l trust Eddie with my life.

28:13.613 --> 28:16.002
Now can l please leave?

28:36.013 --> 28:38.447
Come on, let's get out of here.

28:38.733 --> 28:41.201
-You okay?
DORlE: She just asked me questions.

28:41.373 --> 28:42.965
Did you get through to her?

28:43.213 --> 28:46.683
She thinks Eddie Reyna's
the greatest guy in the world.

28:47.013 --> 28:49.402
l still get nightmares
being back in school. . .

28:49.573 --> 28:53.009
. . .getting called on, l don't have
my homework.

28:54.653 --> 28:57.087
l want you to know that l've
spoken to my union. . .

28:57.253 --> 28:59.483
. . .and they said to notify them
if you harass me.

28:59.693 --> 29:01.763
l'm sympathetic with all your concerns.

29:02.133 --> 29:05.921
But l need for you to confirm for us
if we've arrested the right kid.

29:06.133 --> 29:08.852
l don't know. l didn't see.

29:09.013 --> 29:12.767
lf Nick Williamson did this, you're not
gonna have to testify here, okay?

29:12.933 --> 29:17.165
He already confessed. Just give me an
indication that what he's saying is true.

29:17.373 --> 29:20.445
l didn't see. l can't give you
an indication one way or the other.

29:20.653 --> 29:23.486
See, l heard your voice on that tape.
So l know you did see.

29:23.653 --> 29:26.929
What l think this is, is that you're
trying to say he didn't do it. . .

29:27.093 --> 29:31.291
. . .without having to say who did.
lf he didn't do it, you better step up.

29:31.453 --> 29:34.013
Otherwise, this kid is going away
and l'm telling you. . .

29:34.213 --> 29:37.011
. . .if he does, and you know
he didn't pull the trigger. . .

29:37.213 --> 29:40.091
. . .it's not only his life that's ruined.
lt's your life too.

29:40.293 --> 29:43.603
Okay, l've been warned.

29:44.653 --> 29:49.044
You can ruin your health over something
like this. Gets to where you can't sleep.

29:49.253 --> 29:51.847
You're eating with your kids
one day and start thinking:

29:52.053 --> 29:55.682
''Gee, l wonder what that kid is eating
at Spofford?'' Prison food.

29:55.893 --> 29:57.849
-Leave me alone.
-Who you talking to now?

29:58.013 --> 30:00.925
To me or to your own conscience?

30:04.893 --> 30:07.123
lf l tell you. . .

30:07.293 --> 30:09.329
. . .then l have to get a transfer
out of here.

30:09.533 --> 30:13.321
Doesn't exactly sound
like you're in love with the place.

30:17.853 --> 30:21.402
Look for someone who's a little older.

30:21.573 --> 30:23.689
Stop playing games with us here.

30:23.853 --> 30:26.321
Now give me a name.

30:30.733 --> 30:33.850
Bruce Mackie.

30:49.813 --> 30:53.442
-Smells good.
-Oh, yeah.

30:54.053 --> 30:54.853
Donna should be home any minute.
Her legal-stenography class ends at 7.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.323
Donna should be home any minute.
Her legal-stenography class ends at 7.

30:58.493 --> 31:03.283
l took some fashion design courses
at Tobe Coburn before l got married.

31:03.453 --> 31:06.286
l'm thinking of trying to find
something in the industry.

31:06.493 --> 31:08.290
Yeah, sounds great.

31:09.133 --> 31:13.126
l'm probably dreaming. l'll probably
end up working at the Gap.

31:13.453 --> 31:16.013
You shouldn't give up your dreams.

31:16.173 --> 31:20.166
That is really nice to hear, Greg.
l haven't heard that for three years.

31:20.373 --> 31:24.446
Jeff doesn't relate to dreams.
He's just not ambitious.

31:24.613 --> 31:27.889
l want something out of life.
ls that so bad?

31:28.053 --> 31:30.567
No, not at all.

31:31.253 --> 31:33.608
You know, maybe l should heat up
the baked apples.

31:33.813 --> 31:36.646
l think they're better when they're hot.

31:38.053 --> 31:40.328
When you left your wife,
did you know for sure. . .

31:40.493 --> 31:45.044
. . .that it was the right thing to do?
Were you absolutely positive?

31:45.333 --> 31:46.925
Yes and no.

31:47.093 --> 31:50.688
But, you know, l think it's different
for everybody.

31:50.853 --> 31:53.606
l know l'm unhappy married to Jeff.

31:53.813 --> 31:57.522
But now, l don't know where l'm going.

31:57.693 --> 32:00.730
l don't know what'll happen to me.
l might be more unhappy.

32:00.933 --> 32:04.448
l'm sure things will work out
for you, Dana.

32:04.973 --> 32:07.407
l'm just so alone.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.844
lt would be so great. . .

32:12.373 --> 32:15.126
. . .to have someone like you. . .

32:16.733 --> 32:20.646
. . .someone who understands
what l'm going through.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.692
Donna understands.

32:23.853 --> 32:26.287
You know, maybe you should go
in the other room. . .

32:26.453 --> 32:29.047
. . .and lie down for a little while.

32:29.213 --> 32:31.169
Greg?

32:31.333 --> 32:33.688
Could you hold me?
Just for a second?

32:33.853 --> 32:36.367
Dana, l don't think that's
such a good idea.

32:36.533 --> 32:40.367
Just hold me for a second, please.

32:40.533 --> 32:44.162
Yeah, all right, just for a second.

32:45.893 --> 32:47.849
There you go.

32:48.093 --> 32:50.288
Oh, here's Donna now.

32:52.573 --> 32:56.248
Donna, l'm glad you're here.
Dana's very upset about her future.

32:56.453 --> 32:59.968
Oh, yeah? ls that why her robe's open?

33:00.133 --> 33:01.691
What's that supposed to mean?

33:01.893 --> 33:03.884
Donna, l think you
got the wrong impression.

33:04.053 --> 33:07.841
He was offering support, which is more
than l can say for you the last few days.

33:08.013 --> 33:10.447
Yeah? He was offering support.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.888
-And what were you offering?
-Girls, ladies--

33:13.053 --> 33:14.566
DANA:
This is how she thinks.

33:14.773 --> 33:18.766
She can't conceive of a man and woman
bonding without some sexual aspect.

33:18.933 --> 33:20.730
Excuse me, l'm going for a walk.

33:20.893 --> 33:22.645
l know how you operate, Dana.

33:22.813 --> 33:24.804
Ever since junior high,
nothing's changed.

33:24.973 --> 33:29.524
Oh, l forgot, she knows everything.
She thinks a D-cup makes her God.

33:29.733 --> 33:32.167
Please turn down the heat
on the baked apples.

33:38.493 --> 33:42.327
James, that 61 you took yesterday,
shots fired.

33:42.533 --> 33:45.570
-Yeah, Eddie Reyna.
-He's DOA.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.005
-What've you got?
-Didn't rob him.

33:59.173 --> 34:01.733
-He's got 1 20 bucks in his pocket.
MARTlNEZ: Hey, hold up.

34:02.693 --> 34:06.003
Outer burns around the wound.
Looks like real close-range.

34:07.653 --> 34:10.645
-Check stiffs for HlV?
-We can.

34:10.813 --> 34:13.646
Test this guy's blood and let me know.

34:14.373 --> 34:15.931
There's his girlfriend.

34:17.253 --> 34:18.811
Come on.

34:19.693 --> 34:22.331
[THUNDERlNG ]

34:23.933 --> 34:25.605
You see what happened, Dorie?

34:26.453 --> 34:28.762
Must've been those drug dealers again.

34:28.933 --> 34:31.322
Did you see what happened to Eddie?

34:32.053 --> 34:34.851
Eddie's dead.

34:36.053 --> 34:39.409
lt's okay.
That's what l'm gonna be soon.

34:39.572 --> 34:41.210
MARTlNEZ:
Why are you gonna be dead?

34:41.373 --> 34:46.163
-Because l'm sick.
-Sick, how?

34:50.132 --> 34:52.567
Dorie, did you get tested?

34:52.733 --> 34:54.643
Yeah.

34:56.453 --> 34:59.365
He made me sick
just like everyone else.

35:00.133 --> 35:02.328
And now he's dead.

35:02.493 --> 35:05.053
lt's what he deserved.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.841
Stand up, Dorie.

35:18.253 --> 35:20.687
We're gonna have to take you
to the station house.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.844
Come on.

35:25.013 --> 35:27.208
l happen to know you're
holding some punk on this.

35:27.373 --> 35:29.967
-Bruce's got no business here.
-We have an eyewitness. . .

35:30.133 --> 35:33.364
. . .a teacher who saw your son point
a gun at Eddie Diaz. . .

35:33.533 --> 35:35.364
-. . .and pull the trigger.
MR. MACKlE: No.

35:35.573 --> 35:38.804
-The guy saw someone else, not Bruce.
-Trust me, the guy knows him.

35:38.973 --> 35:43.125
Bruce is never gonna get
through a line-up.

35:43.613 --> 35:45.569
l don't know what
they're talking about.

35:45.733 --> 35:48.327
Are you lying to me?

35:49.453 --> 35:50.647
l ain't saying nothing.

35:50.853 --> 35:53.572
You know what a murder charge
means, Bruce?

35:53.773 --> 35:54.733
-Twenty-five years to life.
-Well, not me. l'm a juvenile.

35:54.733 --> 35:56.610
-Twenty-five years to life.
-Well, not me. l'm a juvenile.

35:56.773 --> 35:59.048
-l shouldn't even be here now.
SlMONE: He's wrong.

35:59.653 --> 36:02.326
He can be tried as an adult
and sentenced as an adult.

36:02.533 --> 36:04.728
l'm not buying this.
We gotta talk to a lawyer.

36:04.893 --> 36:07.043
Look, Mr. Mackie, l got one offer
to make here.

36:07.253 --> 36:10.450
lt gives your son a chance to have a life.
You wanna hear it?

36:11.653 --> 36:13.245
Yeah.

36:15.093 --> 36:19.006
Bruce makes a full and frank confession.
He expresses remorse for his actions.

36:19.173 --> 36:21.403
We'll make an effort
to try this in family court.

36:21.613 --> 36:26.050
-Effort? You gotta do better than that!
-We don't got to do anything!

36:26.213 --> 36:29.683
We can close this case, and little Brucie
here heads off to Ossining.

36:29.853 --> 36:32.162
He didn't say he did it!
We don't know that.

36:32.373 --> 36:37.731
-l'll put him in the system. Stand up!
-No, wait, wait, wait!

36:38.453 --> 36:41.525
No, l'll take the deal.

36:43.733 --> 36:46.327
Look, l don't wanna be tried
as an adult.

36:46.933 --> 36:49.322
Let's hear it.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.642
l shot him.

37:01.533 --> 37:03.842
Why?

37:08.133 --> 37:11.170
He was gonna tag our place in the yard.

37:11.333 --> 37:13.722
No other reason?

37:15.053 --> 37:16.930
He shouldn't have been there.

37:17.453 --> 37:19.842
SlMONE:
How did Nicky get the gun?

37:20.813 --> 37:23.566
Came running over.

37:23.733 --> 37:26.805
l gave it to him after l capped the guy.

37:46.333 --> 37:49.723
l'm sorry, Dad. l'm sorry, Dad.

38:04.853 --> 38:07.083
You disappointed Nick?

38:07.293 --> 38:09.853
No. Why?

38:10.053 --> 38:13.170
Bruce confessed. He's the big shot now.

38:13.373 --> 38:15.933
-l don't believe that.
-l'll play you the tape.

38:16.653 --> 38:20.282
He said he killed Eddie. Then he gave
you the gun and told you to ditch it.

38:20.453 --> 38:23.172
He said he should've known better
than to give it to a wimp.

38:23.413 --> 38:25.165
He didn't say that.

38:25.373 --> 38:28.410
l'm telling you, he must be some
kind of guy, this Bruce.

38:28.613 --> 38:32.811
What did he ever do for you that's
worth three to five years in prison?

38:32.973 --> 38:34.884
l don't rat.

38:35.053 --> 38:36.452
lt's respect.

38:36.653 --> 38:39.531
Oh, yeah? And how did he
earn that respect?

38:39.813 --> 38:42.532
Did he feed or house you?
Did he work to support you?

38:42.693 --> 38:45.765
-What exactly did this Bruce do?
-lt's not what he did.

38:45.933 --> 38:49.403
-lt's what he is.
-Oh, and what's that?

38:49.573 --> 38:52.292
ls he some kind of king badass?
Let me tell you something.

38:52.453 --> 38:55.365
He's downstairs right now bawling
his eyes out. He used you.

38:55.533 --> 38:59.811
He used you, and you went for it.
lt's got nothing to do with respect.

39:00.013 --> 39:01.810
-Yeah, it does.
-Your mother there. . .

39:02.053 --> 39:03.725
. . .she works hard to feed you. . .

39:04.053 --> 39:07.329
. . .to put a roof over your head.
She's the one that earns respect. . .

39:07.533 --> 39:10.764
-. . .and you're giving her grief.
-l know what my mom does for me!

39:10.973 --> 39:13.851
Yeah, but do you care?
You're ready to leave her on her own. . .

39:14.053 --> 39:17.841
. . .because you figure you owe
some punk more than you owe her.

[THUNDERlNG ]

39:27.453 --> 39:30.092
What happened in that schoolyard, Nick?

39:40.653 --> 39:43.121
lt's like you said.

39:44.733 --> 39:47.964
Bruce shot him and handed me the gun.

39:48.173 --> 39:50.243
CHRlSTY:
Oh, Nicky.

39:53.093 --> 39:56.130
You did the right thing here, Nick.

39:58.653 --> 40:01.121
You acted like a man.

40:17.053 --> 40:20.489
He'll give a statement to an ADA
in the matter of hiding the gun.

40:21.373 --> 40:24.763
-He won't have to go to jail?
-We'll talk to them.

40:24.933 --> 40:29.324
l can't make any promises, but l'm
pretty sure he'll just be a witness.

40:32.253 --> 40:34.562
COSTAS:
All right, all right. Thanks.

40:34.773 --> 40:39.164
She laid in wait with a gun.
We have to take it to the grand jury.

40:39.373 --> 40:42.445
You'll indict her, but you couldn't
move on the guy who made her sick?

40:42.613 --> 40:45.969
-No jury in the world will convict her.
-lt'll never go to a jury.

40:46.453 --> 40:48.967
We'll take the plea
and suspend the sentence.

40:49.213 --> 40:51.283
She already got her sentence.

40:57.653 --> 40:59.166
Hey.

40:59.333 --> 41:02.052
-You finish the fives?
-Yeah.

41:02.253 --> 41:04.289
l'm glad it worked out like this.

41:04.453 --> 41:07.525
Glad for that woman that took care
of your wife.

SlMONE:
Thanks.

41:10.653 --> 41:13.451
That's the thing about
working the precinct, Andy.

41:13.853 --> 41:17.368
Sometimes you actually get a chance
to do some good.

41:19.533 --> 41:22.693
When l was drinking,
some mornings l'd get up. . .

41:22.693 --> 41:24.524
When l was drinking,
some mornings l'd get up. . .

41:27.453 --> 41:30.092
. . .and trying not to remember
what l was doing.

41:30.253 --> 41:32.164
lf l could drag ass
to the station house. . .

41:32.333 --> 41:37.327
. . .at least l had a chance
of making some sense of something.

41:43.653 --> 41:46.042
You got plans for dinner?

41:46.493 --> 41:48.563
You're on your own?

41:48.773 --> 41:51.571
Yeah, she lets me out once in a while.

41:51.733 --> 41:53.564
Sure.

42:08.453 --> 42:11.843
Donna, maybe we should talk
about last night.

42:12.213 --> 42:15.125
Why? You explained yourself.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.563
Yeah, and l got the silent treatment
in return. . .

42:17.733 --> 42:21.408
-. . .ever since l got back from my walk.
-There's nothing to talk about, Gregory.

42:21.573 --> 42:24.773
My sister's always done this.
She's always hit on my boyfriends.

42:24.773 --> 42:25.330
My sister's always done this.
She's always hit on my boyfriends.

42:25.973 --> 42:28.533
-l didn't do anything, Donna.
-You didn't have to.

42:28.693 --> 42:32.368
lf l didn't get home when l did, all you
would've had to do was stand there. . .

42:32.533 --> 42:35.969
-. . .and she would've done it for you.
-Hey, listen. . .

42:36.133 --> 42:39.967
. . .no matter when you came home,
nothing would've happened. . .

42:40.133 --> 42:42.806
. . .because l'm not one
of your old boyfriends.

42:43.853 --> 42:46.925
l didn't say you were.
l just know Dana.

42:47.173 --> 42:50.051
Then you gotta know me.

42:50.973 --> 42:54.761
l love you. l'd never touch her.

42:55.933 --> 43:00.768
And if you'd like my opinion,
l don't think Dana should stay with us.

43:05.453 --> 43:08.968
l'm gonna talk to her tonight.
l'm gonna tell her to pack her things.

43:09.133 --> 43:12.011
She's moving to the YW,
and l don't care what my mother says.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.243
Yeah, and if you wanna know
what l say. . .

43:14.413 --> 43:18.645

getting past this.

43:46.653 --> 43:51.283
Well, this tragedy could've happened
in my place too, Sylvia.

43:51.493 --> 43:54.644
lt didn't, but it could have.

43:54.813 --> 43:57.691
l don't think we should
let it affect our schedule.

43:59.733 --> 44:03.931
So next week you'll spend
three nights here?

44:04.093 --> 44:07.722
Yeah, and then four the next week
and so on, you know. . .

44:07.893 --> 44:11.727

There's things l. . .

44:18.373 --> 44:21.843
. . .l've really wanted
and l could never have. . .

44:22.293 --> 44:25.251
. . .without a life like the life
that we're gonna have.

44:28.813 --> 44:32.203
There's some beautiful triggerfish
that l could never mix in. . .

44:32.373 --> 44:36.332
. . .with those other kinds,
and now l can get those.
