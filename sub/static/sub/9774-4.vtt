- But they're not real.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.926
HANNIBAL: They don't need to be real.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.523
Next to these eyes,
real rocks is a waste of bread.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.046
JAMIE: Hey.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.885
This how he treats all his bands?

22:22.360 --> 22:24.681
I'm so sorry. It's crazy here today.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.564
- Fucking bullshit.
- Have you had lunch?

22:26.760 --> 22:27.807
No.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.042
There's a diner called Munson's up the block.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.601
We ain't signed.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.520
We ain't got no money.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.211
LESTER: What'd you think
was gonna happen?

22:48.280 --> 22:49.327
I don't...

22:49.400 --> 22:52.006
Even if you managed to sell this sorry shit
as an album, what then?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.969
The fucking <i>Mike</i> Douglas Show like this?

22:54.280 --> 22:56.726
Am I a sideshow monkey, man?
Put me in a little vest?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.370
- Shut the fuck up.
- You got a guilty conscience

22:58.480 --> 22:59.481
and this is your solution?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.130
Ten years and this is what you come up with?

23:01.200 --> 23:03.168
Yeah, man, that's it! That's all I got!

23:03.440 --> 23:04.851
You don't like it, get the fuck out!

23:07.760 --> 23:08.841
Fuck.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.210
I listened to that shit.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.641
That's my fault.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.968
It's been years since I heard what I used to...

23:28.320 --> 23:30.243
Why didn't you just fucking
hit me with a bat like Galasso did?

23:30.320 --> 23:32.891
- Ain't no difference.
- Lester, if I thought for one second

23:32.960 --> 23:34.166
that this was gonna hurt...

23:36.600 --> 23:39.285
Look, I swear to God, man, I just thought that
if we took those tracks...

23:39.360 --> 23:41.203
What are you doing? What are you doing?

23:41.280 --> 23:43.487
Oh, that's great. Very nice.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.004
Oh, come on, man. Yeah, that's really great.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.050
Thanks. Cece, get me some water, please.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.922
- Cece, get me some water!
- Holy shit!

23:54.000 --> 23:55.764
Cece, get me a fire extinguisher!

23:56.240 --> 23:57.571
WOMAN: What's happening in there?

23:58.200 --> 24:00.601
- Back, now.
- Are we getting water?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.842
- Cece, anybody, get me some water!
- I sent someone, Richie.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.803
JAMIE: Hurry up!
CECE: Get the hell out of there!

24:04.920 --> 24:06.410
(FIRE ALARM RINGING)

24:06.840 --> 24:08.126
CECE: Go away! Get out!

24:08.200 --> 24:10.248
- RICHIE: What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.731
Fucking kidding me?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.843
Fuck!

24:42.440 --> 24:45.410

that she loved you</i>

24:45.480 --> 24:51.123
<i>Much more than I did</i>

24:51.560 --> 24:54.006
<i>But all I know
is that she left you</i>

24:54.080 --> 24:56.686
<i>And you swear that you
just don't know why...</i>

24:56.760 --> 24:58.842
WOMAN: This was when?
DEVON: Uh, a couple weeks ago.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.570
WOMAN: You, too, or just the den?

25:01.240 --> 25:02.207
Excuse me?

25:02.280 --> 25:04.044
Any physical abuse in the marriage?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.691
Oh, no, no. Not in... No.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.326
No, you don't need to write that down.
It was an accident.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.009
(SCOFFS) ls that what women say?

25:18.120 --> 25:19.690
I get a lot of clumsy women.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.410
That's not what this was.
It was a car accident.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.847
As much my fault as Richie's.
So you can cross that out.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.445
How about I do my part, you do yours?

25:25.520 --> 25:28.569
I don't want you suggesting in your records
that I have an abusive husband.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.766
He abuses drugs.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.363
That's different.
I want it to be about what it is.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.522
- Drug abuse.
- And alcohol.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.887
- Which, for an addict with a history of...
- Accidents.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.243
Is this supposed to feel
like a cross-examination?

25:40.320 --> 25:42.163
It's not supposed to feel very nice.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.322
And if someone told you it would,
they misled you.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.446
You expect sole custody of the children?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.081
No.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.881
He's a good father.
He's never exposed the kids to...

25:53.960 --> 25:57.009
I thought your son
found him drunk on the couch

25:57.080 --> 25:59.003
with the rectangular guitar.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.411
Shared custody.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.686
Because he's a good father?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.081
Yes.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.801
Sylvia!

26:07.080 --> 26:08.127
Invoice the hour.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.521
You want the questionnaire?

26:09.800 --> 26:11.006
Sure, what the hell?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.568
You bring a checkbook with you,
Mrs. Finestra?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.480
- Yes.
- Great.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.369
There's a $150 charge for this meeting

26:21.440 --> 26:23.408
and Sylvia will give you a questionnaire.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.970
You can fill it out at home.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.410
Your secretary said on the phone

26:27.520 --> 26:29.807
that there would be no charge
for the initial consultation.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.210
- Well, she was mistaken.
- What if I hadn't brought my checkbook?

26:33.320 --> 26:34.606
Lucky for me you did.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.648
If you think this somehow
makes me more comfortable

26:37.720 --> 26:39.131
with the idea of you handling my divorce...

26:39.240 --> 26:41.129
You're not getting divorced, Mrs. Finestra.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.202
You just wasted an hour of my time

26:43.280 --> 26:46.489
generating a card to play
in the next fight you have with your husband.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.289
That is
the most condescending thing anyone...

26:48.360 --> 26:50.169
You love your husband, sweetheart.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.402
I wish you didn't.
He sounds like a real asshole.

26:52.920 --> 26:57.369
If I'm wrong, fill out the questionnaire
and we'll discuss it the next time we meet.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.967
$150. My last name is Gross.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.281
Spelled like "Wow, that was really gross."

They could care less about me</i>

27:19.000 --> 27:21.162
<i>As long as they are to end
the place that they want to be</i>

27:21.240 --> 27:23.481
<i>They're always wearing false smiles
I guess it goes with their style</i>

27:23.560 --> 27:25.289
<i>Politicians in my eyes...</i>

27:36.080 --> 27:37.844
<i>LESTER". You get an idea, you can't shake it.</i>

27:38.120 --> 27:39.849
Hum along with it when you're on a train.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.244
You like it for a minute, but then you hate it.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.602
It ain't good enough,
but you write it down anyway

27:44.680 --> 27:45.841
just to get it out of your head.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.926
Then you pull out your guitar,

27:48.400 --> 27:49.731
see if it might stand up.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.443
Your mouth, your thought, your hand.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.000
Put a microphone in your face,
somebody hits record. Hmm.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.960
Now you sign a deal with a label,

28:02.320 --> 28:04.527
paid you a big chunk of change
to cut an album,

28:04.600 --> 28:07.968
so you're feeling like the man,
but they gonna hit that pile of cash,

28:08.440 --> 28:10.124
pull out a stack to pay for the studio,

28:10.360 --> 28:14.126
the guy pushing the button and the cover art
and the poster and the launch party.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.041
That's called recoupment.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.925
Cut the record, it sells in stores,
shop gets half.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.443
Take out a buck for the manufacturing.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.849
Buck and a half for the distribution.
Buck for marketing.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.801
Not a whole lot left for you.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.647
But, even if there is,

28:31.200 --> 28:34.966
you don't get to see a dime of it
till they pay off your production costs.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.408
Probably need to sell
100,000 records to do that.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.086
A hundred thousand is more people
than you'll ever meet in your life.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.007
You know the difference
between mechanical royalties,

28:46.120 --> 28:49.363
performance royalties, artist royalties,
songwriting royalties?

28:50.680 --> 28:53.251
All that shit's gonna show up
on a stack of paper,

28:53.320 --> 28:56.324
your name at the bottom under a dotted line
like it's already done.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.483
And Richie Finestra's gonna hand you
a drink and a pen.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.009
He knows that
every single one of those things

29:03.080 --> 29:05.321
is negotiable down to 100th of a percent.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.641
I know.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.330
Only ones that don't know is you.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.560
And you're the ones holding the pen.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.970
CECE: Hannibal said he'd put me on the list
for the show tonight.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.008
- RICHIE: Good for you.
- You're going, too, right?

29:24.720 --> 29:26.324
What do you want, a ride in the limo?

29:28.800 --> 29:30.006
Are you gonna change before the show?

29:30.120 --> 29:32.043
I take off the jacket, it's a whole nother story.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.646
All right.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.082
Goulet wants to record an original song,
I think we should let him do it.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.606
- Throw him a bone.
- You're the one who thinks

29:43.680 --> 29:46.331
we're getting evicted,
so if you want to do it...

29:46.400 --> 29:48.641
You're the one who wants new material, okay?

29:48.720 --> 29:50.961
He's got a fresh idea. It's worth trying.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.805
Got him in here anyhow.
Not like we got to hire an orchestra.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.004
You know what, we're here arguing

29:56.080 --> 29:57.684
and they're sitting in the studio
burning up the hour...

29:57.760 --> 29:59.046
I said yes.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.965
What, you want it in a telex?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.561

30:06.560 --> 30:08.688
Richie, you're signing the Nasty Bits.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.646
- You can do it in Julie's office.
- Can't I get one minute?

30:11.840 --> 30:14.650
No. They've been
sitting here for the entire afternoon.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.241
- Try and look excited, okay?
- Shut the fuck up.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.242
Hey, there they are. The Bits.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.609
We were listening
to your demo this afternoon.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.251
- It was so hot, set my office on fire.
- Shit.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.688
Cece's gonna open a bottle of champagne
so we can all get shit-faced, okay,

30:29.760 --> 30:31.603
before you throw your chop on the line.
Come on.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.607
Get in there, you nasty, Nasty Bits.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.920
Hey, coffee.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.921
We want to
go over a couple of deal points first, yeah?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.606
Yeah, okay. Sure.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.367
Our manager's gonna join.
He just went to take a leak.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.764
You got a manager?
Good, one less thing to figure out.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.570
- Yeah, there he is.
- Great.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.480
You two go back, right?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.444
I don't need to do no introductions.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.930
What the hell are you doing?
You can't touch that.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.164
I'm gonna have to call my manager.

I get you fired.

- Okay, sunflower?

31:43.160 --> 31:44.571
Hey, why is my Donny Osmond display

31:44.640 --> 31:47.041
shoved in the back of the window
behind the Dueling fucking Banjos?

31:47.120 --> 31:49.521
People love those banjos.
That fucking retarded kid.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.761
But I paid you for the front row.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.286
I want to see Donny Osmond's face,
he's got half a nose out there.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.691
Okay, okay. I'll fix it.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.651
Okay, Mario just sent you
an overrun of the Osmond.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.805
I want you to hold off on it for a while.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.881
- You kidding me?
- No.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.167
Gonna put the whole operation
on ice for a couple of months.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.324
Fuck that.
I got two dozen copies of that fucking record.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.326
I want my return money.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.643
No, you can return what you'd have normally.
No extras, okay?

32:12.720 --> 32:15.166
'Cause I got accountants
crawling up every orifice this week.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.447
- That's your problem, man.
- Oh, you want to blow the whole gig?

32:17.520 --> 32:18.567
You don't need the extra cash?

32:18.640 --> 32:19.880
They pay you so much as a manager

32:20.000 --> 32:22.606
of shoving paper clips up his ass,
you don't want a cut anymore?

32:22.680 --> 32:23.920
Why can't Mario take them back?

32:24.040 --> 32:25.405
Because Mario's a fucking asshole.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.720
Like you're a fucking asshole.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.451
He gets a cut, you get a cut.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.120
- I'm the only one taking risks.
- Oh, you don't get a cut?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.771
You bought that shit-brown Camaro on
what you won betting on the Mets?

32:34.280 --> 32:35.361
I take plenty of risk.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.406
Howard's been sniffing around here
all the time now that his wife left him.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.210
And I'll tell you what risk I'm not gonna take.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.045
I'm not storing 50 boxes
of illegal Donny Osmond albums.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.566
I'm gonna lose my job.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.406
I just bought a bumper pool table.
I can't be out of work right now.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.970
You destroyed my office!

32:56.720 --> 32:58.370
That's 10 grand worth of damage in there.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.324
Fucking gold records warped.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.640

33:01.720 --> 33:04.007
You're a fucking manager,
I'm Venus on the half-shell.
