00:02.753 --> 00:04.380
<i>I'd like to tell you a story</i>

00:04.463 --> 00:06.424
<i>about a time I was right.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:07.842
<i>Now, I'm sure you're thinking,</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:10.469
<i>"But, Sheldon,
you're never wrong."</i>

00:10.553 --> 00:12.471
<i>And you'd be right.</i>

00:13.681 --> 00:15.558
<i>But it's worth taking
a closer look</i>

00:15.641 --> 00:18.227
<i>at this particular incident.</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:20.604
<i>Because it began
with a loaf of bread,</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:23.107
<i>and ended with me and my family</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:27.069
<i>almost being kicked out of
the United States of America.</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:33.159
Uh-oh.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.285
What's the matter?

00:34.368 --> 00:36.454
Something's wrong
with my sandwich.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.997
Did it go bad?

00:38.080 --> 00:41.667
No. It just tastes... different.

00:41.751 --> 00:44.253
If you don't want it,
I'll trade you for my dumplings.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.421
I'm already unhappy.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.923
Do you really think dumplings
will fix the problem?

00:48.007 --> 00:50.926
It'll fix my problem.
I'm sick of dumplings.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.681
Mary Cooper,
how may I bless you?

00:55.765 --> 00:56.974
<i>Hello, Mom?</i>

00:57.058 --> 00:58.601
Sheldon? Everything okay?

00:58.684 --> 01:00.144
- No.
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:02.897
- What happened?
- My sandwich tastes different.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.066
You know you're not
supposed to call

01:05.149 --> 01:06.400
unless it's an emergency.

01:06.484 --> 01:09.278
I'm well aware.
So what did you change?

01:09.361 --> 01:10.905
I didn't change anything.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.866
Same bread, same peanut butter,
same jelly.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.952
Did you use one knife
for the PB and the J?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.371
- No.
- Are you sure?

01:19.455 --> 01:21.665
That was one time two years ago,

01:21.749 --> 01:23.292
and all the other knives
were dirty.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.336
It was 14 months
and 11 days ago.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.671
When we made the big switch
from Wonder Bread.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.756
Oh, how could I forget?

01:28.839 --> 01:31.175
Sheldon, I didn't
change anything.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.802
Can I get back to work now?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.346
I suppose so.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.889
Thank you. Bye.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.557
Don't I get an "I love you"?

01:38.641 --> 01:40.392
I love you.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.812
One more time,
with a little more energy.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.943
Must've been disconnected.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.904
Well, my mother didn't do
anything differently.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.614
Are you gonna eat it?

01:53.697 --> 01:56.951
Better. I'm going
to do science on it.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.453
I would eat it.

02:01.539 --> 02:02.873
Are the goggles necessary?

02:02.957 --> 02:05.459
No, but they really
set the mood.

02:05.543 --> 02:08.670
Okay, subject "A," jelly.

02:12.383 --> 02:16.387
That's definitely strawberry
and definitely Smuckers.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.765
Subject "B."

02:22.393 --> 02:25.104
That's Jif all right.
Creamy and delicious.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.522
It must be the bread.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.567
Hold on. This is a
scientific experiment.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.569
We can't make
assumptions.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.487
Subject "C."

02:34.989 --> 02:37.032
It's the bread.

02:37.116 --> 02:40.327
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am♪♪</i>

02:40.411 --> 02:43.038
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain♪♪</i>

02:43.122 --> 02:45.416
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero♪♪</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:48.377
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man♪♪</i>

02:48.460 --> 02:52.381
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

02:59.763 --> 03:01.974
Welcome to the family, Hacksaw.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.442
- Hey.
- Oh.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.818
Hey, Georgie.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.403
You okay?

03:14.486 --> 03:15.654
Mm-hmm.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.281
You sure?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.741
Not really.

03:18.824 --> 03:22.203
Um... Dustin broke up with me.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.622
What?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.957
He said I was immature.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.209
Is he crazy?

03:28.292 --> 03:31.003
Everything about you
screams womanhood.

03:32.463 --> 03:33.589
See?

03:33.672 --> 03:36.383
Happy Hearth Home Bakeries,
just like always.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.928
Well, something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.096
- What?
- That's Shakespeare, Mom.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.138
Great.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.475
Missy, did your sandwich
taste different today?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.727
Couldn't tell you.
I traded it for a Ding Dong.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.981
Your sandwich is exactly
the same, Sheldon.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.442
- What's going on?
- This bread is different.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.693
Let me see.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.821
You know, he
might be right.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.823
Ow.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.076
Shelly, it's probably
just your taste buds

04:02.159 --> 04:03.535
changing as you get older.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.120
But I don't like change.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.747
Then you're gonna
hate puberty.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.626
Got me with your ring.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.629
She wasn't wrong.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.357
Studies do support
that your sense of taste

04:15.381 --> 04:16.507
changes over time.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.884
So the bread's the same
and you're different?

04:18.968 --> 04:20.427
Apparently so.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.099
Nope, it's the bread.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.988
Hey.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.531
Hi.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.033
I was wondering if you wanted
to grab a bite to eat

04:43.117 --> 04:44.285
at the Waffle House?

04:45.494 --> 04:46.912
Not like a date.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.790
But as someone who recently
had his heart broke,

04:49.873 --> 04:51.125
I think I could help.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.793
Who broke your heart?

04:53.752 --> 04:54.753
I love you.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.588
Ooh!

04:56.672 --> 04:57.715
You did.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.842
Oh. Yeah.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.386
I'm just saying,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.221
I know what
you're going through.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.849
So if you need a friend with
a pocket full of waffle money...

05:11.687 --> 05:13.731
Look at these prices.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.292
No wonder supermarkets
are running my parents

05:15.316 --> 05:16.817
out of business.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.694
Your parents own
a convenience store.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.946
They charge extra
for the convenience.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.656
How is this not convenient?

05:22.740 --> 05:23.782
Excuse me, sir.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.367
Has anything changed
with the bread

05:25.451 --> 05:27.536
from the Happy Hearth
Home Bakeries?

05:27.619 --> 05:28.787
I have no idea.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.956
How can you not know?
You work here.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.082
What do you want from me?

05:32.166 --> 05:34.835
I get $3.35 an hour
to stock shelves.

05:34.918 --> 05:35.919
Are you kidding?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.005
My father pays me
five dollars a week.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.593
I bet they're violating
child labor laws.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.178
Look. This loaf says

05:44.261 --> 05:47.097
"A subsidiary of the Domestic
Food Corporation."

05:47.181 --> 05:48.682
This older loaf doesn't.

05:48.766 --> 05:51.060
I wonder if I can take
my parents to court?

05:51.143 --> 05:54.021
It smells like my bread.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.648
Or I could start a labor union
with my sisters.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.234
This is it!
This is my bread!

05:59.318 --> 06:00.444
We could go on strike.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.363
Bring them to their knees.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.989
Vindication!

06:12.247 --> 06:13.582
Happy Hearth Home Bakeries.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.459
This is Pete.
How can I help you?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.086
Hello, Pete.
My name is Sheldon Cooper,

06:17.169 --> 06:18.921
and I would like to know
what changed

06:19.004 --> 06:21.340
in your white sandwich loaf
to make it taste different.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.801
Sheldon, hang up the phone.
It's dinner time.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.096
Be right there, Mom. I'm doing
battle with corporate America.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.390
I'm sorry, Pete.
You were saying?

06:29.473 --> 06:31.326
Any chance your bread was past
the expiration date?

06:31.350 --> 06:34.228
No, it was brand-new.
But I did a taste comparison

06:34.311 --> 06:37.147
after it was bought out
by the Domestic Food Corporation,

06:37.231 --> 06:39.441
and they are definitely
not the same.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.443
Well, I can assure you that...

06:41.527 --> 06:42.820
"The recent acquisition

06:42.903 --> 06:45.823
by the Domestic Food
Corporation has not affected

06:45.906 --> 06:48.033
the quality of our products
in any way.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.953
Every single bread, baked good,
and pastry

06:51.036 --> 06:53.455
is made with love,
from our hearth to your home."

06:53.539 --> 06:56.250
Then why does it taste
different, Pete? Why?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.727
Well, because
now we make everything

06:57.751 --> 07:00.045
really cheap and fast. Bye.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.052
I thought Dustin was different.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.304
I thought he wanted to live
a Christian life like me.

07:09.388 --> 07:13.142
But... all he wanted
is what every guy wants.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.018
Guys.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.938
Oh, please, you're
all the same.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.774
Hey. You rejected me,
you punched me in the face,

07:20.858 --> 07:22.734
and I'm still here.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.820
Happy eating waffles with you.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.699
Georgie, do you really think
you're capable

07:28.782 --> 07:30.200
of just being my friend?

07:30.868 --> 07:32.953
That's a good question.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.289
My brain says yes.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.082
What about the rest of you?

07:37.166 --> 07:39.585
Honestly, I wouldn't trust it.

07:42.171 --> 07:45.215
Excuse me. Would you
like to sign my petition

07:45.299 --> 07:46.651
against Happy Hearth
Home Bakeries?

07:46.675 --> 07:49.094
Maybe on the way out.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.513
Excuse me. Would you like
to sign my petition

07:51.597 --> 07:53.348
against Happy Hearth
Home Bakeries?

07:53.432 --> 07:55.601
Oh. Maybe on the way out.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.852
I hate to say it,

07:56.935 --> 07:59.855
but everybody's way out
is at the other set of doors.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.109
I have noticed.
Why do you think that is?

08:04.193 --> 08:06.570
Cowards.
The whole bunch of 'em.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.657
Mr. Givens!

08:11.325 --> 08:12.993
Hello, Sheldon.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.662
Meemaw, this is my science
teacher, Mr. Givens.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.331
- Nice to meet ya.
- Hi.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.874
This is strange.
I never think of you

08:18.957 --> 08:20.709
as existing outside of school.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.920
Well, it turns out I do.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.047
And you're here
buying food.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.632
I am.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.550
Fascinating.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.595
All right.
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.889
Wait. Would you like
to sign my petition

08:33.972 --> 08:35.283
against Happy Hearth
Home Bakeries?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.475
Well, what have they done?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.203
They're making their bread
faster and cheaper

08:38.227 --> 08:39.227
to save money.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.979
That's terrible.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.524
It is. Would you like to sign?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.609
- I would.
- Excellent.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.945
- I'll get you on the way out.
- Thank you.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.323
Well, that's one.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.492
Yeah.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.667
<i>I know it's tough,
but you gotta be strong.</i>

09:01.750 --> 09:04.127
<i>And remember,
you're not alone.</i>

09:05.003 --> 09:06.004
Hello?

09:06.088 --> 09:07.339
<i>Kinda busy.</i>

09:07.422 --> 09:09.192
Well, there's only one bathroom
in the house, Georgie,

09:09.216 --> 09:11.009
and it's not
for phone calls.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.219
<i>I gotta call you back.</i>

09:13.512 --> 09:14.680
Sorry.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.390
Who you talking to?

09:16.473 --> 09:17.808
That Veronica girl?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.059
Yeah.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.435
What's going on with that?

09:20.519 --> 09:22.104
Nothing. We're
just friends.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.522
Okay.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.691
Now, you ever want to run
any of this stuff by me,

09:25.774 --> 09:26.942
I'm here for you.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.027
Why would I want
to run it by you?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.613
Well, I was once
a 15-year-old boy.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.658
I know what it's like to have
strong feelings for a girl.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.120
Gross. I'm not gonna
talk to you about this.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.747
I... I saw that kid
on <i>Who's the Boss?</i>

09:40.831 --> 09:43.000
talk to Tony Danza
about his problems.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.169
They're not related.
This is totally different.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.969
<i>Damn it, Georgie,
you could flush once in a while.</i>

09:55.596 --> 09:57.306
On behalf of
sandwich-loving children

09:57.389 --> 09:59.057
everywhere, I thank you.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.060
- How many is that?
- 13.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.729
A baker's dozen.
What do you say we

10:03.812 --> 10:04.980
pack up and head
outta here?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.566
No, we have to wait
for Channel 7 news.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.775
Channel 7?

10:08.859 --> 10:10.277
Yes. I called them this morning

10:10.360 --> 10:11.921
and told them
there was a human interest story

10:11.945 --> 10:13.238
at the supermarket.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.322
What story?

10:14.323 --> 10:15.782
Classic Americana.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.492
Little guy
versus corporate greed.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.203
Honey, Channel 7
is not coming...

10:22.873 --> 10:24.916
- You Sheldon Cooper?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.376
You gotta be kidding me.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.502
How's my hair look?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.303
Hey, how'd it go?

10:36.386 --> 10:37.929
Great.
Turn to Channel 7.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.264
But I'm watching the game.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.224
But I'm going
to be on Channel 7.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.351
What's he talking about?

10:42.434 --> 10:45.103
He's gonna be on Channel 7.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.023
<i>I was shocked to learn</i>

10:48.106 --> 10:50.442
<i>that the Happy Hearth Home
Bakeries had been bought out</i>

10:50.525 --> 10:52.027
<i>by the Domestic
Food Corporation,</i>

10:52.110 --> 10:54.696
<i>and they started making their bread
faster and cheaper.</i>

10:54.780 --> 10:57.115
<i>- And you don't like that, do you?
- No.</i>

10:57.199 --> 10:58.784
<i>And you're collecting signatures</i>

10:58.867 --> 11:00.702
<i>- to make them stop.
- I am.</i>

11:00.786 --> 11:02.954
<i>Corporations
shouldn't be allowed to make</i>

11:03.038 --> 11:04.373
<i>these decisions on their own.</i>

11:04.456 --> 11:05.832
<i>Well, who should?</i>

11:05.916 --> 11:07.459
<i>The people who eat the bread.</i>

11:07.542 --> 11:09.836
<i>This wouldn't happen
if there were centralized control</i>

11:09.920 --> 11:11.380
<i>over all these big corporations.</i>

11:11.463 --> 11:12.964
<i>Are you suggesting</i>

11:13.048 --> 11:16.218
<i>a communist form of government
in Texas?</i>

11:16.301 --> 11:17.344
<i>I suppose I am.</i>

11:17.427 --> 11:18.428
<i>Hang on a sec...</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:21.390
<i>There you have it.
Local boy Sheldon Cooper</i>

11:21.473 --> 11:24.726
<i>says communism
is what Texas needs.</i>

11:26.478 --> 11:27.729
Oh, dear God.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.694
I just... you...

11:33.777 --> 11:36.154
Why... I-I-I-I-I...

11:36.238 --> 11:37.823
Why would you...

11:37.906 --> 11:39.533
What were you th...

11:39.616 --> 11:40.826
- Oh, God.
- Calm down.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.328
It was just the 4:00 news.
I'm sure no one saw it.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.830
I hope a lot of people saw it

11:44.913 --> 11:45.997
and Happy Hearth is forced

11:46.081 --> 11:47.624
to give our country
good bread again.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.959
No! No more bread.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.877
No more country.
No more talking.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.463
Excuse me.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.006
Where are you going?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.360
I'm gonna go put up an American
flag in front of my house.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.820
That's a great idea.
Mare, where's our flag?

11:58.844 --> 12:00.554
Uh, uh, it's in the garage.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.933
Is something wrong?

12:05.016 --> 12:07.686
Yes, Sheldon,
something is wrong.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.813
Oh, now what?

12:12.149 --> 12:14.067
Is anybody going to fill me in?

12:15.652 --> 12:17.195
Not a good time, Brenda.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.740
I don't want your boy
playing with my boy anymore.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.075
Excuse me?

12:22.159 --> 12:23.285
Someone get that!

12:23.368 --> 12:25.328
I just saw Sheldon on the news.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.514
He doesn't need to be filling

12:26.538 --> 12:29.374
Billy's head
with crazy commie ideas.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.877
Crazier than sitting on an egg
and trying to hatch it?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.796
'Cause I saw your precious son
do that the other day.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.591
Oh, so you're spying on us.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.676
Good to know.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.265
Yes, I do understand
we're in the middle of a cold war.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.475
But have you seen

12:46.558 --> 12:49.603
how many people wait in line
for bread in Moscow?

12:49.686 --> 12:51.980
It stands to reason
their bread must be great.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.106
Who you talking to?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.734
- A reporter from <i>Time</i> magazine.
- No!

12:56.735 --> 12:57.736
He didn't mean it.

12:57.819 --> 12:58.987
God bless America.

13:09.331 --> 13:12.042
- Traitors.
- Yeah, go back to Russia.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.044
Go back?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.171
I've never been there
in the first place.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.881
Well, have a great
day, Georgie.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.884
A great day?
Are you out of your mind?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.761
Our lives are over.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.972

I know it looks bad,
but we're handling it.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.388

I'm sorry, George,
but I can't have

Well, this bread better be worth
you losing your job.

Now, hang on.
G... Give me a chance to fix it.

15:49.824 --> 15:50.867
Please.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.372
All right, George.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.135
But if I hear
from one more angry parent...

15:57.207 --> 15:59.834
Thank you. Thank you.

You're my people.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.435
Then what's this all about?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.270
My son just wanted

You're welcome.
Now, I understand

16:50.969 --> 16:52.363
you wanted to set
the record straight

16:52.387 --> 16:54.055
regarding your
son's communism.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.598
Yes. N... No!

16:55.682 --> 16:58.226
He's not a communist.
He's ten years old.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.061
Listen,
I fought for this country.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.479
I love this country.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.981
My kids love this country.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.232
Isn't that right, Sheldon?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.192
Yes.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.652
Although, in all fairness,

17:07.736 --> 17:09.820
the Social Security system
is a form of...

17:09.904 --> 17:11.990
- You love this country!
- I love this country.

17:24.169 --> 17:27.255
I have something important
that I'd like to say.

17:30.842 --> 17:31.843
These last few days,

17:31.926 --> 17:33.636
I've been giving
the new Happy Hearth bread

17:33.720 --> 17:34.864
another chance,
and I've decided

17:34.888 --> 17:36.473
it's not so bad.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.643
Also, it toasts well.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.898
So, I'm going to say

17:44.981 --> 17:47.650
that's a sign of personal
growth on my part.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.320
In fact, let's call it maturity.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.660
Still not talking to me, huh?

17:59.120 --> 18:02.373
Well...
I'll check back in tomorrow.
