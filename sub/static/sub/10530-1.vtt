- Yeah, I sure am.

to be joined together
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.501
- Man, it sure is hot.
- Hot? You call this hot?

04:47.379 --> 04:48.631
Well, I'll be...

04:48.756 --> 04:51.092
- What's the matter?
- Thought I saw Ben Miller.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.261
- He's down in Texas somewhere.
- I know.

04:54.470 --> 04:56.597
Looked like Pierce and Colby, too.

04:57.098 --> 04:58.516
It couldn't be, though.

05:18.202 --> 05:20.621
My goodness gracious.

05:27.169 --> 05:30.339
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir.

05:30.548 --> 05:32.424
At least, I think so, sir.

05:32.550 --> 05:36.262
Don't know a reason
why it shouldn't be, Mr Pierce.

I do.

06:44.663 --> 06:48.500

I'm going to try, Amy. I'll do my best.

I will, too.

- I can.

Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

10:30.847 --> 10:33.350
- What's so funny?
- I mean a big hurry.

10:35.018 --> 10:38.730
Hey, you don't suppose Kane's scared
of those three gunnies?

10:41.608 --> 10:45.070
Well, you didn't see him.
I never saw him whip a horse that way.

10:57.374 --> 10:59.543
- Sam!
- Come in, Helen.

10:59.751 --> 11:03.755
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.595
I guess I'll take a look around.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.977
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got to go back, Amy.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.604
Why?

12:00.729 --> 12:02.439
This is crazy.
I haven't even got any guns.

12:02.564 --> 12:04.608
Then let's go on. Hurry.

12:04.816 --> 12:07.903
No, that's what I've been thinking.

12:08.403 --> 12:11.573
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

12:11.698 --> 12:15.493
- Well, I don't understand any of this.
- Well, I haven't got time to tell you.

12:15.619 --> 12:19.539
- Then don't go back, Will.
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

13:21.851 --> 13:24.437
- Kane's back.
- I don't believe it.

13:24.562 --> 13:25.980
I just seen him.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.528
- How many coffins we got?
- Two.

13:31.653 --> 13:34.114
We're going to need at least two more
no matter how you figure.

13:34.239 --> 13:36.032
You'd better get busy, Fred.

13:38.701 --> 13:42.997
Please, Will, if you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

13:43.832 --> 13:46.209
I sent a man up five years ago for murder.

13:46.334 --> 13:48.002
He was supposed to hang.

13:48.128 --> 13:52.006
But up north, they commuted it to life.
Now he's free.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.260
I don't know how.
Anyway, it looks like he's coming back.

13:55.385 --> 13:57.011
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

13:57.720 --> 14:01.724
Well, he was always wild, kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

14:02.851 --> 14:05.478
But that's no concern of yours,
not anymore.

14:06.229 --> 14:08.398
I'm the one who sent him up.

14:08.606 --> 14:10.191
Well, that was part of your job.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.361
That's finished now.
They've got a new marshal.

14:13.486 --> 14:17.699
He won't be here till tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.119
Anyway, I'm the same man,
with or without this.

14:21.244 --> 14:22.745
Well, that isn't so.

14:22.871 --> 14:24.581
I expect he'll come looking for me.

14:24.706 --> 14:26.749
Three of his old bunch are waiting
at the depot.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.835
That's exactly why we ought to go.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.629
They'll just come after us. Four of them.

14:32.297 --> 14:34.340
And we'd be all alone on the prairie.

14:35.216 --> 14:36.301
We've got an hour.

14:36.426 --> 14:37.927
- What's an hour?
- Well, we could...

14:38.052 --> 14:41.014
What's 100 miles? We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

14:41.139 --> 14:43.808
They'd come after us and we'd have to
run again as long as we live.

14:43.933 --> 14:47.312
No, we wouldn't.
Not if they didn't know where to find us.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.400
Oh, Will.
Will, I'm begging you, please let's go.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.568
I can't.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.946
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero. Not for me.

14:57.071 --> 15:01.367
I'm not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

15:01.576 --> 15:04.412
Look, Amy, this is my town.
I've got friends here.

15:04.746 --> 15:06.372
I'll swear in a bunch of special deputies

15:06.497 --> 15:09.083
and with a posse behind me,
maybe there won't even be any trouble.

15:09.209 --> 15:13.588
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then it's better to have it here.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.262
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.847
Do you?

15:22.972 --> 15:25.850
Of course I do.
I know it's against your religion and all.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.896
- Sure I know how you feel.
- But you're doing it just the same.

15:31.064 --> 15:35.276
Oh, Will, we were married
just a few minutes ago.

15:35.944 --> 15:39.614
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

15:40.365 --> 15:43.409
You know I've only got an hour
and I've got lots to do.

15:44.160 --> 15:49.029
- Stay at the hotel until it's over.
- No, I won't be here when it's over.

15:49.184 --> 15:52.835
You're asking me to wait an hour to find
out if I'm going to be a wife or a widow.

15:52.961 --> 15:56.306
- I say it's too long to wait. I won't do it.
- Amy!

15:56.431 --> 16:00.802
I mean it, if you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.138
I've got to stay.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.455
- Glad you got here, Perce.
- Are you?

16:42.301 --> 16:45.805
Have you forgotten that I'm the man
who passed sentence on Frank Miller?

16:47.348 --> 16:50.059
You shouldn't have come back, Will.
It was stupid.

16:50.184 --> 16:53.729
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.398
You figured wrong.

16:55.523 --> 16:58.276
I can deputise a posse.
Ten, 12 guns is all I need.

16:58.401 --> 17:00.736
Yeah, my intuition tells me otherwise.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.321
Why?

17:04.073 --> 17:06.992
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

17:07.535 --> 17:09.954
In the fifth century B.C.,
the citizens of Athens,

17:10.079 --> 17:13.749
having suffered grievously under a tyrant,
managed to depose and banish him.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.085
However, when he returned some years later

17:16.210 --> 17:20.964
with an army of mercenaries, those same
citizens not only opened the gates for him,

17:21.299 --> 17:24.926
but stood by while he executed
members of the legal government.

17:26.137 --> 17:31.476
A similar thing happened about eight
years ago in a town called Indian Falls.

17:32.143 --> 17:35.563
I escaped death
only through the intercession of a lady

17:35.688 --> 17:38.149
of somewhat dubious reputation,

17:38.274 --> 17:42.361
and at the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

17:42.487 --> 17:46.073
- Unfortunately, I have no more rings.
- You're a judge.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.327
I've been a judge many times
in many towns.

17:49.785 --> 17:52.163
And I hope to live to be a judge again.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.041
I can't tell you what to do.

17:55.166 --> 17:58.127
Why must you be so stupid, Will?
Have you forgotten what he is?

17:58.252 --> 17:59.629
Have you forgotten
what he's done to people?

17:59.754 --> 18:01.464
Have you forgotten that he's crazy?

18:01.589 --> 18:03.674
Don't you remember
when he sat in that chair and said,

18:03.799 --> 18:06.344
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

18:06.469 --> 18:09.430
"I'll kill you, Will Kane.
I swear it, I'll kill you"?

18:16.812 --> 18:19.148
Here you are, ma'am.
This'll take you to Saint Louis.

18:19.273 --> 18:20.441
Thank you.

18:27.782 --> 18:29.575
Maybe you'd rather wait somewheres else.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.285
Like at the hotel, maybe.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.662
All right, thank you.

18:32.787 --> 18:34.997
I'm awfully sorry
about all this, Mrs Kane.

18:35.122 --> 18:38.417
But don't you worry, the marshal
will take care of himself all right.

18:38.542 --> 18:40.127
Thank you very much.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.965
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

18:44.465 --> 18:45.967
So what?

18:46.092 --> 18:48.928
Nothing. Yet.

18:54.016 --> 18:57.812
Harvey, don't you think Kane
will be looking for you about now?

18:58.062 --> 18:59.063
Yeah.

19:00.147 --> 19:01.649
You're really sore at him.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.442
Wouldn't you be if you were me?

19:03.567 --> 19:05.569
I suppose. If I were you.

19:14.578 --> 19:16.247
Be back in a little while.

- Think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.570
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

19:48.112 --> 19:51.115
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

19:51.615 --> 19:53.200
There isn't time.

19:54.285 --> 19:56.996
What a waste. Good luck.

- Why ain't you?

- Look, will you do something for me?
- Sure.

20:20.936 --> 20:22.646
- and tell them I want them here.
- Right.

20:22.771 --> 20:26.108
- And then find Harv Pell.
- Don't have to do that, here I am.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.486
- Well, where have you been?
- Busy.

20:29.778 --> 20:31.155
- You know what's doing?
- Sure.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.406
Well, come on, we got lots to do.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.285
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

20:36.494 --> 20:37.912
Well, that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.873
When I tell you, it means something,
so you can just listen a second.

20:40.998 --> 20:42.500
All right, I'm listening.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.502
Now, this is the way I see it.

20:44.919 --> 20:47.463
If you'd gone, with the new marshal
not due here till tomorrow,

20:47.588 --> 20:49.340
I'd be in charge around here, right?

20:49.465 --> 20:50.633
Right.

20:50.758 --> 20:54.845
Well, tell me this, then, if I'm good enough
to hold down the job when there's trouble,

20:54.970 --> 20:57.306
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanent?

20:57.431 --> 20:59.183
I don't know.

20:59.308 --> 21:01.519
- Don't you?
- No.

21:01.644 --> 21:03.687
That's funny, I figured
you carried a lot of weight.

21:04.355 --> 21:08.067
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

21:08.192 --> 21:09.777
You think I'm too young, too?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.071
You sure act like it sometimes. Come on.

21:21.121 --> 21:22.873
It's very simple, Will.

21:22.998 --> 21:26.168
All you gotta do is tell the old boys
when they come that I'm the new marshal.

21:26.794 --> 21:30.839
And tomorrow they can tell the other fellow
they're sorry, but the job's filled.

21:30.965 --> 21:33.634
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

21:35.844 --> 21:38.639
- Well, I can't do it.
- Why not?

21:39.181 --> 21:41.517
If you don't know,
it's no use me telling you.

21:41.642 --> 21:42.810
You mean you won't do it.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.728
Have it your way.

21:44.853 --> 21:48.315
All right, the truth is you probably
talked against me from the start.

21:50.150 --> 21:53.445
You've been sore about me and
Helen Ramírez right along, ain't you?

21:54.738 --> 21:56.365
You and Helen Ramírez?

21:57.866 --> 22:01.704
It so happens I didn't know, and it doesn't
mean anything to me one way or the other.

22:01.829 --> 22:02.913
You ought to know that.

22:03.038 --> 22:05.124
Yeah, you been washed up
for more than a year.

Oh, you go out and get yourself married,

22:07.251 --> 22:10.045

taking your place there, can you?

22:10.170 --> 22:12.506
- Especially me.
- You're a...

22:18.721 --> 22:20.848
I haven't got time, Harv.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.559
Okay, then let's get down to business.

22:24.059 --> 22:26.395
You want me to stick,
you put the word in for me like I said.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.105
Sure, I want you to stick.

22:28.230 --> 22:30.983
But I'm not buying it.
It's got to be up to you.

23:06.143 --> 23:07.978
I thought you'd grew up by now.

23:08.937 --> 23:12.858
I thought your disposition might have
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

23:13.275 --> 23:14.818
I guess we're both wrong.

23:22.743 --> 23:24.203
What's so funny?

23:25.162 --> 23:27.664
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

23:27.790 --> 23:28.791
Why not?

23:29.124 --> 23:30.876
When are you going to grow up?

23:31.251 --> 23:32.711
I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.

23:32.836 --> 23:35.130
- Then grow up.
- Cut it out!

23:40.552 --> 23:41.678
All right.

23:42.179 --> 23:44.348
Why shouldn't he have gone for it?
He needs me.

23:44.473 --> 23:46.308
He'll need me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

23:46.433 --> 23:47.476
That's possible.

23:47.601 --> 23:49.144
Should've had me made marshal
to begin with.

23:49.269 --> 23:51.730
He's just sore, is all.
Sore about you and me.

23:52.314 --> 23:53.815
- Is he?
- Sure.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.777
- You told him?
- Sure.

You are a fool.

Why? Didn't you want him to know?

Hey, who did the walking out, anyway?
You or him?

24:14.503 --> 24:15.671
Get out, Harvey.

24:17.172 --> 24:19.508
- I might just do that.
- Then do it.

- Try me.

- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

24:34.564 --> 24:37.901

so pretty when he gets through with you.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.072
He won't believe me. He'll know I'm lying.

You do like I tell you.

39:24.828 --> 39:25.996
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:37.758 --> 39:41.887
- Hello, Mrs Fuller, is Sam in?
- No. No, he isn't.

39:44.598 --> 39:47.893
Do you know where he is, Mrs Fuller?
It's important to me that I find him.

39:48.018 --> 39:52.481
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

39:54.775 --> 39:55.943
Without you?

39:56.068 --> 39:58.403
I'm gonna go in a little while,
as soon as I dress.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.329
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

40:31.311 --> 40:34.690
Now, what do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

40:34.815 --> 40:37.109
Do you want to be a widow?
Is that what you want?

40:37.234 --> 40:39.069
No, Sam, no.

40:40.195 --> 40:41.196
JIMMY: Kane.

40:44.032 --> 40:47.953
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothing. I've been looking for you.

40:48.078 --> 40:51.707
I want a gun. I want to be with you
when that train comes in.

40:53.166 --> 40:57.337
- Can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

40:57.587 --> 40:59.089
- Honest.
- But why...

40:59.214 --> 41:01.842
It ain't just getting even.
It's a chance, see? It's what I need.

41:01.967 --> 41:04.302
Please, Kane, let me get in on this.

41:05.512 --> 41:08.432
All right, Jimmy,
I'll call you if I need you.

41:20.694 --> 41:21.987

Come in, Sam.

41:31.329 --> 41:33.039
You're leaving town?

41:34.499 --> 41:37.461
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

41:38.170 --> 41:40.505
That doesn't make much sense.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.136
You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller?

41:46.761 --> 41:47.804
No.

41:47.929 --> 41:50.056
Sure you are, or you wouldn't be running.

41:50.182 --> 41:53.393
You got nothing to be worried about
as long as I'm around. You know that.

41:53.518 --> 41:55.770
I'm not scared of Miller.
I'll take him on any time.

41:55.896 --> 41:57.314
I believe you.

41:57.814 --> 41:59.274
Then why are you going?

42:00.817 --> 42:02.527
- You cutting out with Kane?
- Oh, Harvey.

42:02.652 --> 42:04.779
- Then why are you going?
- What difference does it make?

42:04.905 --> 42:06.156
It's Kane. It's Kane, I know it's Kane.

42:06.406 --> 42:11.369
It isn't Kane, but I'm going to tell you
something about you and your friend Kane.

42:11.494 --> 42:12.871
You're a good-looking boy.

42:12.996 --> 42:16.583
You have big, broad shoulders,
but he is a man.

42:16.708 --> 42:19.502
It takes more than big, broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

42:19.628 --> 42:21.671
and you have a long way to go.

42:23.715 --> 42:26.509
You know something?
I don't think you will ever make it.

42:29.137 --> 42:31.306
Let me tell you something.
You're not going anywhere.

42:31.431 --> 42:34.935
You're staying here with me.
It's going to be just like it was before.

42:39.773 --> 42:41.983
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

42:42.817 --> 42:47.197
Kane will be a dead man in half an hour,
and nobody is going to do anything about it.

42:47.322 --> 42:51.493
And when he dies, this town dies, too.
I can feel it.

42:51.743 --> 42:53.536
I am all alone in the world.

42:53.662 --> 42:57.999
I have to make a living.
So I'm going someplace else. That's all.

43:02.003 --> 43:05.423
And as for you, I don't like anybody
to put his hands on me

43:05.548 --> 43:06.716
unless I want him to.

43:06.841 --> 43:09.636

I'm sorry, Parson.
I don't want to disturb the services.

43:47.632 --> 43:49.342
You already have.

43:49.467 --> 43:52.262
You don't come
to this church very often, Marshal.

43:52.387 --> 43:55.724
And when you got married today,
you didn't see fit to be married here.

43:56.141 --> 43:58.768
What could be so important
to bring you here now?

And maybe that's a bad thing.

44:10.572 --> 44:14.033
And I didn't get married here today
because my wife's a Quaker.

44:14.784 --> 44:18.496
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

know it, but if you don't,

ain't no longer marshal?

and what Miller is.

What's more, we're wasting time.

46:19.284 --> 46:21.744
All right. Coy.

46:21.869 --> 46:25.707
Yes, we all know who Miller is.
But we put him away once.

46:25.832 --> 46:29.335
And who saved him from hanging?

we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.

You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

we're gonna have plenty more trouble.

Go ahead, Kibbee.

47:23.639 --> 47:25.349

walking the streets bold as brass.

47:28.728 --> 47:30.271
Why didn't you arrest them, Marshal?

47:30.396 --> 47:32.315
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

47:32.440 --> 47:35.026
Then we'd only have Miller to worry
about instead of the four of them.

47:35.151 --> 47:37.779
I haven't anything to arrest them for,
Mr Trumbull.

47:37.904 --> 47:39.405
They haven't done anything.

There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

Don't you remember when a decent woman

47:48.956 --> 47:51.292
couldn't walk down the street
in broad daylight?

47:51.417 --> 47:54.879
Don't you remember when this wasn't
a fit place to bring up a child?

47:55.004 --> 47:58.466
How can you sit here
and talk and talk and talk like this?

47:58.591 --> 48:00.802
What are we all getting so excited about?

48:00.927 --> 48:03.596
How do we know
Miller's on that train, anyway?

48:03.888 --> 48:06.349
Well, we can be pretty sure he's on it.

48:06.641 --> 48:08.518
Time's getting short.

48:10.019 --> 48:12.813
Parson, you got anything to say?

48:12.939 --> 48:17.235
I don't know. The Commandments say,
"Thou shalt not kill."

48:17.360 --> 48:19.904
But we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

48:20.279 --> 48:23.032
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here.

48:23.699 --> 48:26.619
But if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill

48:26.744 --> 48:28.788
and maybe get themselves killed,

48:29.038 --> 48:33.292
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

48:34.627 --> 48:36.837
All right. I'll say this,

48:36.963 --> 48:39.840
what this town owes Will Kane here,
it can never pay with money.

48:39.966 --> 48:41.634
And don't ever forget it.

48:42.218 --> 48:45.972
He's the best marshal we ever had,
maybe the best marshal we'll ever have.

48:46.097 --> 48:50.768
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

48:51.102 --> 48:54.188
It's our problem because this is our town.

48:54.313 --> 48:56.691
We made it with our own hands
out of nothing.

48:56.816 --> 48:59.193
And if we want to keep it decent,
keep it growing,

48:59.318 --> 49:01.279
we've got to think mighty clear
here today.

49:01.404 --> 49:04.115
And we've got to have the courage
to do what we think is right,

49:04.240 --> 49:07.285
no matter how hard it is. All right.

49:07.994 --> 49:11.080
There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

49:11.205 --> 49:15.209
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure. Now,

49:15.835 --> 49:18.838
people up north
are thinking about this town.

49:18.963 --> 49:22.300
Thinking mighty hard, thinking about
sending money down here

49:22.425 --> 49:24.885
to put up stores and to build factories.

49:25.261 --> 49:28.431
It'll mean a lot to this town. An awful lot.

49:28.889 --> 49:32.601
But if they're gonna read about
shooting and killing in the streets,

49:32.727 --> 49:34.729
what are they gonna think then?

49:34.895 --> 49:39.734
I'll tell you. They're gonna think
this is just another wide-open town,

49:39.859 --> 49:42.945
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

49:43.070 --> 49:47.700
In one day,
this town will be set back five years.

49:48.034 --> 49:50.578
And I don't think we can let that happen.

49:50.828 --> 49:54.081
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

49:54.665 --> 49:57.084
He's a mighty brave man. A good man.

49:57.710 --> 50:00.129
He didn't have to come back here today.

50:00.671 --> 50:04.341
And for his sake and the sake
of this town, I wish he hadn't.

50:05.926 --> 50:08.262
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

50:08.387 --> 50:11.432
my hunch is there won't be any trouble.
Not one bit.

50:11.557 --> 50:13.267
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal,

50:13.392 --> 50:16.520
and if we can all agree here
to offer him our services,

50:16.729 --> 50:19.523
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

50:20.316 --> 50:22.026
Now, to me, that makes sense.

50:22.693 --> 50:25.071
To me, that's the only way out of this.

50:26.572 --> 50:30.659
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

50:32.495 --> 50:35.581
It's better for you, and it's better for us.

can come back and shoot at you again.

54:29.356 --> 54:31.650
- So long, Mart.
- So long.

54:33.485 --> 54:38.198
It's all for nothing, Will.
It's all for nothing.

54:44.121 --> 54:45.414
(WHISTLING)

54:49.209 --> 54:53.297
Excuse me,
what is Mrs Ramírez's room number?

54:54.423 --> 54:56.550
- Three.
- Thank you.

55:13.734 --> 55:15.027
HELEN: Come in.

55:18.614 --> 55:22.242
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramírez? I'm Mrs Kane.

55:22.951 --> 55:24.161
I know.

55:26.455 --> 55:28.999
- May I come in?
- If you like.

55:35.172 --> 55:37.883
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

55:38.300 --> 55:40.344
- What do you want?
- Oh, please...

55:40.469 --> 55:43.805
It's just that I'm afraid if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

55:43.930 --> 55:46.850
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

55:47.059 --> 55:48.143
Why?

55:48.852 --> 55:52.397
Look, Mrs Ramírez,
Will and I were married an hour ago.

55:52.522 --> 55:54.649
We were all packed and ready to leave,

55:54.775 --> 55:57.277
and then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

55:57.402 --> 56:01.740
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

56:02.616 --> 56:06.703
- And now?
- Well, that man downstairs, the clerk,

56:07.371 --> 56:09.498
he said things about you and Will.

56:10.332 --> 56:12.959
I've been trying to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

56:13.085 --> 56:16.671
and now all I can think of
is that it's got to be because of you.

56:16.797 --> 56:18.382
What do you want from me?

56:18.507 --> 56:21.802
Let him go. He still has a chance.
Let him go.

56:21.927 --> 56:25.389
- I cannot help you.
- Please.

56:25.514 --> 56:27.682
He isn't staying for me.

56:28.183 --> 56:31.186
I haven't spoken to him for a year
until today.

56:34.898 --> 56:39.444
- I am leaving on the same train you are.
- Then what is it? Why is he staying?

56:40.362 --> 56:44.074
If you don't know,
I cannot explain it to you.

56:46.409 --> 56:49.913
Well, thank you, anyway.
You've been very kind.

56:51.748 --> 56:55.794
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

56:56.128 --> 56:59.047
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

56:59.256 --> 57:01.925
No, Mrs Ramírez, I've heard guns.

57:02.592 --> 57:05.220
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

57:05.804 --> 57:09.933
They were on the right side, but that didn't
help them any when the shooting started.

57:10.058 --> 57:13.436
My brother was 19. I watched him die.

57:14.646 --> 57:19.609
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

57:20.110 --> 57:23.363
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

57:26.199 --> 57:28.535
Will knows how I feel about it.

57:29.536 --> 57:33.248
Just a minute. Are you going
to wait for the train downstairs?

57:33.999 --> 57:36.543
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

57:53.059 --> 57:56.479
Well, I got no use for Kane,
but I'll say this, he's got guts.

57:56.605 --> 57:59.065
You're mighty broad-minded, Joe.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.405
Now, you, Harv,
I always figured you for guts,

58:05.530 --> 58:07.908
but I never gave you any credit
for brains, till now.

58:08.033 --> 58:09.701
What's that mean?

58:10.493 --> 58:14.414
Nothing. Only it takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

58:17.083 --> 58:21.546
If I can't pick my company when I drink
in here, I ain't coming in here anymore.

58:22.297 --> 58:25.508
Okay. All right.

58:25.634 --> 58:28.553
Look at the boy with the tin star.

58:28.678 --> 58:31.264
All right, if that's the way you want it.

58:34.559 --> 58:37.145
JOE: All right, boys,
what are you going to have?

59:42.293 --> 59:43.461
(HORSE SNORTING)

59:55.181 --> 59:58.685
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

59:59.227 --> 01:00:00.937
He'll go a long way before he tires.

01:00:01.062 --> 01:00:02.897
That's what you were thinking, wasn't it?

01:00:03.022 --> 01:00:04.941
- Kind of.
- You scared?

01:00:06.818 --> 01:00:08.027
I guess so.

01:00:09.904 --> 01:00:12.365
Sure. It stands to reason.

01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:18.246
Come on, let me help you.

01:00:24.085 --> 01:00:27.964
Seems like all everybody and his brother
wants is to get me out of town.

01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:30.550
Well, nobody wants to see you get killed.

01:00:33.428 --> 01:00:34.596
Hold it. Where are you going?

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:36.222
I don't know. Back to the office, I guess.

01:00:36.347 --> 01:00:39.350
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and you're getting out.

01:00:39.475 --> 01:00:41.227
What's the matter with you?

01:00:41.352 --> 01:00:44.022
You were ready to do it yourself.
You said so.

01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:45.648
Look, Harv.

01:00:45.773 --> 01:00:48.109
I thought about it because I was tired.

01:00:48.234 --> 01:00:50.612
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired.

01:00:50.737 --> 01:00:52.864
- But I can't do it.
- Why?

01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:54.782
I don't know.

01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:57.243
Get on that horse, Will.

01:00:58.995 --> 01:01:01.956
Why is it so important to you?
You don't care if I live or die.

01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:03.374
Come on.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.211
Don't shove me, Harv.
I'm tired of being shoved.

01:01:42.747 --> 01:01:44.832
(HORSES NEIGHING FRANTICALLY)

01:02:51.566 --> 01:02:54.694
I hate this town. I always hated it.

01:02:56.112 --> 01:02:59.240
To be a Mexican woman in a town like this.

01:02:59.657 --> 01:03:00.867
I understand.

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:04.996
You do? That's good.

01:03:05.121 --> 01:03:08.833
I don't understand you.
No matter what you say.

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:12.003
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him like this.

01:03:12.128 --> 01:03:14.088
I'd get a gun. I'd fight.

01:03:14.213 --> 01:03:15.381
Why don't you?

01:03:17.341 --> 01:03:20.052
He is not my man. He's yours.

01:03:39.614 --> 01:03:42.241
You got some clean water I can use?

01:03:42.366 --> 01:03:45.870
Why, sure, Marshal. Sure, sure. Sit down.

01:03:53.127 --> 01:03:55.338
Run into some kind of trouble, Marshal?

01:03:55.463 --> 01:03:57.131
No, no trouble.

01:03:58.257 --> 01:03:59.467
(HAMMERING)

01:04:01.594 --> 01:04:04.972
- What are you building?
- Oh, just fixing things up out back.

01:04:05.097 --> 01:04:08.225
Now take it easy, Mr Kane.
Just settle back. That's it.

01:04:11.479 --> 01:04:13.898
- Fred, Fred, hold it a while, will you?
- Hold it?

01:04:14.023 --> 01:04:15.691
You just stop till I tell you to start again.

01:04:34.877 --> 01:04:37.129
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Marshal.

01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:38.631
No charge...

01:04:38.756 --> 01:04:41.592
You can tell your man
he can go back to work now.

01:05:06.701 --> 01:05:07.702
Will!

01:05:07.827 --> 01:05:11.372
I guess I forgot about you, Herb.
I'm sure glad you're here.

01:05:11.497 --> 01:05:13.416
I couldn't figure out
what was keeping you.

01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:15.960
- Time's getting pretty short.
- Sure is.

01:05:16.085 --> 01:05:19.380
When are the other boys gonna
get here? We got to make plans.

01:05:19.505 --> 01:05:22.216
The other boys?
There aren't any other boys, Herb.

01:05:22.341 --> 01:05:24.719
- It's just you and me.
- You're joking.

01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:27.304
No, I couldn't get anybody.

01:05:28.222 --> 01:05:31.267
I don't believe it.
This town ain't that low.

01:05:31.475 --> 01:05:33.269
I couldn't get anybody.

01:05:33.811 --> 01:05:36.480
- Then it's just you and me.
- I guess so.

01:05:36.605 --> 01:05:39.567
You and me against Miller
and all the rest of them?

01:05:40.401 --> 01:05:43.028
That's right. Do you want out, Herb?

01:05:43.362 --> 01:05:47.366
Well, it isn't that I want out, no.

01:05:48.075 --> 01:05:50.286
You see... Look, I'll tell you the truth.

01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:53.831
- I didn't figure on anything like this, Will.
- Neither did I.

01:05:53.956 --> 01:05:55.458
I volunteered. You know I did.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:57.376
You didn't have to come to me.
I was ready.

01:05:57.501 --> 01:06:00.754
Sure, I'm ready now.
But this is different, Will.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.756
This ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

01:06:02.882 --> 01:06:05.259
This is just plain committing suicide.
And for what?

01:06:05.384 --> 01:06:07.761
Why me? I'm no lawman. I just live here.

01:06:07.887 --> 01:06:11.390
I got nothing personal against nobody.
I got no stake in this.

01:06:12.308 --> 01:06:13.809
I guess not.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.520
There's a limit
how much you can ask a man.

01:06:16.645 --> 01:06:19.148
I got a wife and kids. What about my kids?

01:06:20.232 --> 01:06:22.193
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:30.451
You get some of the other fellows, Will,
and I'll still go through with it.

01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:32.369

like you wanted me to.

01:07:02.942 --> 01:07:06.570
- All but Mr Henderson.
- I found him. Thanks.

01:07:06.695 --> 01:07:08.197
You're welcome.

Marshal, listen. Let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

01:07:14.495 --> 01:07:17.164
- No.
- Please let me, Marshal.

You're a kid. You're a baby.

You ought to see me.

You're 14.
And what do you want to lie for?

01:07:26.048 --> 01:07:29.218
Well, I'm big for my age. Please, Marshal.

01:07:29.343 --> 01:07:31.887
Well, you're big for your age all right,
but, no.

01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:34.390
