WEBVTT

01:45.752 --> 01:47.419
Watch where you're going!

02:01.075 --> 02:02.075
Hey.

02:02.591 --> 02:03.591
Hey.

02:07.514 --> 02:08.514
What's up?

02:09.052 --> 02:10.052
Neh...

02:10.498 --> 02:11.498
Not much.

02:22.265 --> 02:23.983
Is Mahdi still mad at me?

02:25.155 --> 02:26.429
No one's mad at you, man.

02:28.671 --> 02:29.671
You sure?

02:29.936 --> 02:30.936
Yeah.

02:37.796 --> 02:39.108
We're just worried, man.

02:40.484 --> 02:42.179
We don't really get what your thing is.

02:42.515 --> 02:43.211
My thing?

02:43.429 --> 02:44.429
Yeah!

02:44.492 --> 02:45.492
You've been...

02:45.679 --> 02:47.070
Acting so strange.

02:47.479 --> 02:48.479
Oh, yeah.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.940
Yeah.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.261
I'm sorry about that. It's just...
A lot is happening right now.

02:53.472 --> 02:55.417
Lately.
Family and stuff as well.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.876
And I can't sleep, so...

02:58.142 --> 03:00.908
I lose my temper like, so damn quickly.

03:01.623 --> 03:03.029
But I'm sorry about that.

03:06.521 --> 03:07.521
Okay...

03:09.475 --> 03:11.139
But... Let me know,

03:11.440 --> 03:13.026
If you want to talk about it.

03:27.743 --> 03:30.143
I don't know, but there's...

03:33.692 --> 03:35.392
That's what I'm thinking as well. That...

03:37.264 --> 03:38.264
Yeah.

03:41.146 --> 03:43.412
When you're in love...

03:44.343 --> 03:48.233
You think love is just like in the movies.

03:49.046 --> 03:50.046
But...

03:51.140 --> 03:52.585
That's not how it works.

03:53.726 --> 03:54.726
I...

03:54.753 --> 04:01.588
I mean, I seriously thought William and
I would be together forever.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.732
It ends where it ends, you know...

04:08.365 --> 04:10.685
No one lives happily ever after.

04:11.865 --> 04:13.889
You know, because in...

04:14.490 --> 04:15.490
Real life...

04:15.846 --> 04:17.924
Like, in the end...

04:18.917 --> 04:25.682
No one's willing to sacrifice anything
for love in 2016.

04:29.902 --> 04:30.980
Did I wake you?

04:32.418 --> 04:34.027
What are you doing here?

04:34.519 --> 04:37.019
No, just... Uh, Eskild
brought a guy home.

04:37.245 --> 04:39.073
So, I just moved here.

04:39.299 --> 04:42.706
The walls are pretty thin in the
living room, to put it that way.

04:42.807 --> 04:45.456
Yeah, well the walls aren't so fucking
thick here either, though?!

04:45.799 --> 04:46.838
I, I need to sleep!

04:46.863 --> 04:49.926
And I can't sleep when you lie here and...
talk a lot of shit!

04:50.026 --> 04:51.979
It's 2 AM! Have some respect!

04:52.526 --> 04:53.526
Okay...?

04:57.144 --> 04:58.644
Yeah. I'm sorry, but...

04:59.246 --> 05:00.832
I have to sleep!

05:02.488 --> 05:04.605
Yeah, I get that.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.566
I...

05:08.026 --> 05:11.175
Of course, I can...
I can talk to Eva tomorrow.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.104
Yeah...

05:14.300 --> 05:15.370
Say hi, though.

05:16.151 --> 05:17.151
I'll do that.

05:24.698 --> 05:26.479
And...

05:27.448 --> 05:28.651
William is an...

05:29.518 --> 05:32.495
an idiot if he gives up on
the two of you.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.104
Good night, Isak.

05:36.635 --> 05:37.932
G'night, Noora.

05:44.623 --> 05:45.732
That'll be 22.

05:46.139 --> 05:47.412
Thank you.

05:48.784 --> 05:51.268
Thanks a lot. Bye!

05:54.104 --> 05:55.504
Do you have more cheese sandwiches?

05:55.557 --> 05:56.753
I can heat one up.

05:57.199 --> 05:58.644
Can you heat one up for me as well?

05:58.824 --> 05:59.824
Yes!

06:05.269 --> 06:06.340
That'll be 25.

06:18.268 --> 06:20.909
Uh, I think there's one crown missing.

06:31.638 --> 06:32.739
There you go.

06:33.317 --> 06:34.317
Thank you.

06:59.056 --> 07:00.056
Thank you.

07:07.672 --> 07:08.672
Hey.

07:09.172 --> 07:10.172
Hey.

07:15.932 --> 07:18.143
No... cardamom?

07:26.057 --> 07:27.151
Cardamom.

07:31.768 --> 07:32.768
No, so...

07:37.403 --> 07:40.091
- But, uh...
- I think I gotta go.

07:47.598 --> 07:49.129
The urine just kept
running out of her?

07:49.154 --> 07:50.715
Yeah.
It was just running out, you know.

07:50.740 --> 07:53.208
She had started working out,
and so it just kept running down

07:53.233 --> 07:55.848
her pants, and into her shoes.
She was very upset, though.

07:56.114 --> 07:57.520
I see. But, uh...

07:57.737 --> 08:00.393
I mean, it does get very loose
if you don't squeeze at all.

08:00.487 --> 08:02.346
Didn't she squeeze at all, then, or?

08:02.549 --> 08:04.924
You know what, I asked
if she had taken that test.

08:04.949 --> 08:06.885
I mean, I said
"Have you put your finger inside?"

08:06.910 --> 08:08.955
And then squeeze real good.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.346
And you know what she said then?
She didn't feel a thing...!

08:11.371 --> 08:11.979
No...

08:12.104 --> 08:13.917
Isak Valtersen.

08:14.971 --> 08:17.409
She was almost on her way
over to Aleris.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.611
You know, start having surgery and such.

08:20.878 --> 08:21.878
Yes.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.397
Just have a seat.

08:25.843 --> 08:26.843
Thanks.

08:33.315 --> 08:35.447
You're...
You're the school doctor?

08:36.346 --> 08:40.104
Yeah, I mean, not exactly a doctor.
Yeah, kinda.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.948
It said... It said doctor on...

08:43.167 --> 08:45.972
Mhm. Well, that sign is from 1962.

08:46.081 --> 08:47.441
What can I do for you?

08:52.026 --> 08:54.222
I'm having trouble sleeping lately.

08:57.293 --> 09:00.332
Yeah, I've had a lot of
trouble sleeping lately.

09:00.357 --> 09:02.120
And it's starting to affect
school and stuff.

09:03.793 --> 09:04.847
That's shitty.

09:05.966 --> 09:06.966
Yeah.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.309
So, I was wondering if I could
get some pills or something.

09:12.481 --> 09:13.919
Because, yeah...

09:14.557 --> 09:17.424
Even though, even though
my problem isn't the worst...

09:19.018 --> 09:20.862
Sleep deprivation is very serious.

09:22.151 --> 09:26.378
You have to think about how many
accidents could've been prevented

09:26.403 --> 09:29.135
If people hadn't fallen asleep
behind the wheel, for example.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.553
I don't... I don't drive a car, though.

09:33.803 --> 09:36.287
No. But you're moving around in traffic...

09:38.310 --> 09:38.826
Yeah.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.717
And that's one inattentive moment, and then

09:41.815 --> 09:44.450
'Bam!', you slam into a
semi truck, break your

09:44.475 --> 09:46.941
neck, and get paralyzed
from the neck down.

09:46.966 --> 09:48.706
You'll go straight into a wheelchair.

09:48.731 --> 09:51.057
It happened to a friend of mine,
she's still in that chair.

09:51.284 --> 09:52.284
Isak.

09:52.479 --> 09:56.081
For how long have you had trouble sleeping?

09:58.471 --> 10:00.057
It's been a while, really.

10:00.112 --> 10:02.620
But it's been worse over
the past couple of weeks.

10:03.073 --> 10:04.073
Like...

10:04.659 --> 10:06.620
Last night I slept for maybe...

10:08.106 --> 10:09.208
One hour.

10:09.895 --> 10:10.895
Yeah.

10:11.052 --> 10:14.395
We'll refer you to BUP then.
(= Child and youth psychiatric polyclinic)

10:14.919 --> 10:16.067
What does that mean?

10:17.135 --> 10:20.674
It means that you'll
get to talk to someone

10:20.699 --> 10:23.448
who can help sort out some of
the thoughts in your head.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.245
No. I'm not doing any of that.

10:26.409 --> 10:27.409
No.

10:28.112 --> 10:29.253
No, it's not like that...

10:30.573 --> 10:33.135
No. I'm not going to do that. Then...

10:33.244 --> 10:35.526
I'm completely serious, I'm not
doing something like that.

10:39.980 --> 10:40.980
Isak.

10:43.168 --> 10:44.691
Do you like other people?

10:47.903 --> 10:49.153
Sure, yeah?

10:50.395 --> 10:50.841
Mhm.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.966
Because you see...

10:53.645 --> 10:57.293
Every person is an island. ("Kvart mennske
er ei Ã¸y", a poem by Tarjei Vesaas)

10:57.470 --> 11:00.416
And the only bridge across to others

11:00.667 --> 11:01.862
Is through words.

11:02.846 --> 11:04.901
And as long as we don't talk to each other

11:05.034 --> 11:07.572
We end up becoming lonely little islands

11:07.768 --> 11:10.948
That are high on pills. Just like Ibiza,
do you get what I'm saying?

11:12.737 --> 11:13.221
No.

11:13.307 --> 11:14.307
No...

11:14.495 --> 11:18.346
I understand that, because I mixed
in a poem by Inger Hagrup

11:18.371 --> 11:20.236
So it didn't make total sense

11:20.261 --> 11:21.542
But the point is

11:22.674 --> 11:24.518
That you can't keep isolating yourself.

11:25.222 --> 11:27.066
Everything is harder on your own.

11:28.176 --> 11:29.176
Hey.

11:31.183 --> 11:33.152
Don't you have someone you can talk to?

12:04.772 --> 12:05.382
Hey.

12:05.741 --> 12:06.741
Hey.

12:10.398 --> 12:12.046
Do you have any plans for tonight, or...?

12:12.977 --> 12:15.422
Nah, I don't really know.
I was just thinking I'd...

12:15.570 --> 12:17.219
Go home and watch a movie or something.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay.

12:19.492 --> 12:20.750
What are you doing now, though?

12:20.963 --> 12:22.487
Now...

12:23.268 --> 12:25.416
Now I was just thinking of going home.
What about you?

12:29.003 --> 12:31.073
Will you join me for a Kebab?

12:31.347 --> 12:32.347
I've got money.

12:32.511 --> 12:33.511
Yeah.

12:34.277 --> 12:35.347
Yeah, sure.

12:35.448 --> 12:36.839
Who would say no to Kebab.

12:38.691 --> 12:39.745
No one.

12:53.682 --> 12:56.034
- Can you hold...
- Yeah!

12:58.408 --> 13:00.533
Where should we...
Where should we go?

13:01.120 --> 13:01.792
Over there.

13:01.987 --> 13:02.987
Not over there?

13:03.104 --> 13:05.674
No, not over there, because...

13:08.510 --> 13:10.479
Dressed. And he was like...

13:10.542 --> 13:12.370
Wearing a shirt and everything.

13:12.588 --> 13:14.908
And I saw that he was flirting with a girl

13:14.933 --> 13:16.393
And I thought like, "Alright."

13:16.667 --> 13:17.667
And then...

13:19.292 --> 13:22.268
And I saw that he was standing with
that girl, then he leaned forward

13:22.721 --> 13:24.268
And then he started vomiting...

13:24.674 --> 13:25.838
Like crazy.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.135
On, like, on her feet.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.745
And he just kept vomiting.

13:30.770 --> 13:33.018
And then he stopped for a few seconds.

13:33.198 --> 13:37.042
And then she had time to start
yelling, like, "What the fuck?!"

13:37.167 --> 13:38.792
And then he started vomiting even more.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.510
It came out like a pressure washer,
and it was absolutely awful.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.409
I was laughing so much!

13:43.807 --> 13:46.096
The ones who vomit are always
the ones you'd least expect.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.331
Yeah!

13:48.065 --> 13:50.167
And... Yeah, I felt really bad for him.

13:51.401 --> 13:52.401
Yeah.

14:13.707 --> 14:15.121
You know...

14:16.386 --> 14:18.753
You know that thing about me
being a little weird lately...?

14:19.293 --> 14:20.293
Mhm?

14:29.673 --> 14:30.673
It's...

14:31.088 --> 14:32.893
It's because of a person I like.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.440
That, uh... Emma?

14:40.167 --> 14:41.206
No, not Emma.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.128
Take a guess.

14:45.299 --> 14:46.307
A guess?

14:47.057 --> 14:48.362
I can't guess...

14:52.105 --> 14:53.105
Try.

14:58.863 --> 14:59.965
Is it Vilde?

15:00.699 --> 15:01.879
Vilde?!

15:02.527 --> 15:04.222
Who do you think I am?! Vilde?!

15:04.247 --> 15:05.652
Yeah, I don't fucking know! What...

15:05.677 --> 15:06.379
No...

15:06.543 --> 15:07.840
Can't you just tell me?

15:12.395 --> 15:13.645
I'll give you a hint.

15:15.981 --> 15:16.981
A hint?

15:22.565 --> 15:23.776
It's not a girl.

15:27.338 --> 15:28.338
Hmm.

15:38.482 --> 15:39.482
Is it me?

15:39.967 --> 15:40.967
No!

15:41.100 --> 15:41.857
You?!

15:42.021 --> 15:43.041
No, no, no!

15:43.596 --> 15:44.346
What the fuck?

15:44.371 --> 15:46.198
Yeah, I don't fucking know.
Just tell me then.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.503
"No, no, no!"
What, am I completely unattractive or what?

15:50.528 --> 15:52.057
No, not like that, but...

15:52.237 --> 15:53.526
No, it's not you.

15:59.647 --> 16:01.085
Is it that...

16:02.987 --> 16:05.526
Is it that guy from Vilde's revue group?

16:06.166 --> 16:07.166
Yeah.

16:10.245 --> 16:11.245
What's his name?

16:11.518 --> 16:12.518
Even.

16:21.026 --> 16:22.128
Good...

16:22.370 --> 16:23.784
Good-looking guy, though.

16:23.932 --> 16:24.932
What?

16:26.331 --> 16:28.159
Yeah? What else am I supposed to say?

16:28.581 --> 16:29.760
I don't even know myself.

16:33.605 --> 16:34.824
But...

16:36.269 --> 16:37.933
What's the thing between the two of you?

16:39.652 --> 16:40.652
Nah...

16:43.237 --> 16:45.018
Nah, I'm not actually sure, right now...

16:45.182 --> 16:48.214
I don't understand shit, because he's a
really back and forth kind of guy

16:48.276 --> 16:49.276
And...

16:49.823 --> 16:50.893
And he has a girlfriend.

16:51.253 --> 16:52.253
Oh, I see.

17:07.167 --> 17:08.854
I think it's mine.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
Hey.

17:18.457 --> 17:20.472
Nah, I'm eating a Kebab is all.

17:22.902 --> 17:23.902
Tomorrow?

17:25.808 --> 17:26.816
Okay. Where?

17:28.847 --> 17:31.410
I'm not sure I can be bothered going
that far just for a party...

17:31.435 --> 17:34.941
(Cheese toastie without cardamom.) (Meanwhile in
another universe: Cheese toastie with cardamom.)

17:34.965 --> 17:36.206
Okay, I'll see you there, then.

17:36.713 --> 17:38.971
Maybe... Okay, bye.

17:42.682 --> 17:43.682
What's that?

17:45.690 --> 17:46.690
It's from Even.

17:56.277 --> 17:58.159
Like, he's got to break up
with his girlfriend.
