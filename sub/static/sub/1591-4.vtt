About the miata queens
of orlando.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.045
We meet every other month,

18:34.047 --> 18:35.046
But whatever.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.848
You'll read about it.
[ sighs ]

18:37.950 --> 18:39.951
[ doorbell rings ]

18:42.488 --> 18:44.122
What's going on?

18:44.124 --> 18:45.790
These two were fast asleep

18:45.792 --> 18:47.758
In the backseat
of a miata I repo'd.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.962
Evan: It was more comfortable
than the pantry.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.464
Uh, of course!

18:53.466 --> 18:56.501
My boys I was so worried about
and knew were gone!

18:56.503 --> 18:59.237
Thank you for not repo'ing
my children.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.672
No problem.
Comes with the job.
Mm.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.841
As well as dibs on anything
we find in the cars.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.009
Mm.

19:14.686 --> 19:17.588
[ speaking chinese ]

19:17.590 --> 19:19.891
Hello, juice.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.628
You know, for the record,

19:23.630 --> 19:25.630
That dealer told me
that miata was new.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.665
Well, people lie.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.133
Sometimes
even to themselves.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.003
[ chuckles ]
hey, don't worry, okay?

19:32.005 --> 19:33.838
I won't tell the family
about any of this.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.473
I know business
has its ups and downs.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.175
You'll get back
on your feet.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.543
I appreciate it, louis.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.178
You know...

19:40.180 --> 19:41.812
I got to say [sighs]

19:41.814 --> 19:44.382
It'd be a lot easier
if I still had my best salesman.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.950
[ chuckles ]

19:45.952 --> 19:47.618
Hey, if you ever need
any advice,

19:47.620 --> 19:49.020
Just give me a call,
okay?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.521
Just not on
my dedicated fax line

19:50.523 --> 19:51.856
'cause that's just
for faxes.

19:51.858 --> 19:52.857
[ chuckles ]

19:52.859 --> 19:54.692
Oh.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.028
There we go.
[ chuckles ]

19:57.030 --> 19:59.497
Sorry I got
a little upset before.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.866
Guess I just got caught up
in the emotion of the moment.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.134
Really?

20:03.136 --> 20:05.503
'cause to me it looked like
you were straight-up crying.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.005
But maybe my baby ears
didn't hear it right.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.341
You guys want to listen
to some 2pac?

20:10.343 --> 20:12.143
Really?
We can listen with you?

20:12.145 --> 20:13.244
Mm.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.513
I'll go get some sunny d
and raisins.

20:15.515 --> 20:19.150
I'll get our toothbrushes
for after.

20:19.152 --> 20:22.853
Well, I can't wait
to get out of this swampland.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.655
Well,
nothing's stopping you.

20:24.657 --> 20:28.426
By the way,
your hair looks terrible.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.128
And your boobs
are way too big.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.334
Have a safe drive, mom.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.402
[ speaks chinese ]

20:39.771 --> 20:41.439
Well,
she's coming around.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.044
Connie!

20:47.046 --> 20:48.179
Coming, ah-ma.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.355
<i>We all took something away</i>
<i>from that trip, except grandma,</i>

20:57.357 --> 20:58.422
<i>Who set something loose.</i>

21:02.961 --> 21:05.429
<i>And in the process, we learned</i>
<i>that just like o.J...</i>

21:05.431 --> 21:07.431
[ engine turns over ]
<i>...People aren't always</i>
<i>what they seem.</i>

21:08.533 --> 21:10.201
I can't believe it.

21:10.203 --> 21:11.302
We won.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.436
Yes, we did.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.039
We finally proved
steve's miata was used.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.140
[ chuckles ]

21:16.142 --> 21:18.542
And we are always honest
with each other.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.244
We are the more
successful couple.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.080
You realize we're swimming
in debt, too.

21:23.082 --> 21:27.485
Yes, but we're swimming
together.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.053
Aw, man!
Ew!

21:29.055 --> 21:30.955
Come on!
That one was gross.
