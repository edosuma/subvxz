WEBVTT

00:05.570 --> 00:07.050
This is
the demon blood.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.138
You have to fight it!

00:12.360 --> 00:13.883
God's gone.
It's just us.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.190
And about
three billion ghosts.

00:16.233 --> 00:19.149
Vinciamni!

00:19.193 --> 00:20.498
The warding
is fading.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.283
Rowena: "Death Is
an Infinite Vessel."

00:22.326 --> 00:26.113
I can soak them up for a time
if I pay the price.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.071
Why didn't you just
stick to the damn plan?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.159
Belphegor was lying.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.118
All the ghosts
and all the demons --

00:31.161 --> 00:34.643
I'm gonna suck them all
right back into me.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.428
Something went wrong.

00:37.472 --> 00:38.864
Something always
goes wrong.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.388
Yeah, why does that something
always seem to be you?

00:40.431 --> 00:42.172
I think it's time
for me to move on.

00:48.439 --> 00:49.919
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.182
Spiced rum
with cinnamon.

00:52.226 --> 00:53.879
I infused it myself.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.664
Bet she learned that
from a podcast.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.188
Yes, I did.
And you're welcome.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.105
To our annual
camping trip.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.717
To 11 years
of not dying from exposure.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.633
To our last
camping trip.

01:08.677 --> 01:11.549
Oh, God.
Ashley, way to be a downer.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.595
We just graduated
from college.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.075
Can't we just
celebrate that?

01:15.118 --> 01:17.555
Yeah, but you two
got jobs.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.079
You're both leaving.

01:20.254 --> 01:23.909
I have a philosophy degree,
and I drive Uber.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.955
Well, you did that
to yourself.

01:26.956 --> 01:31.134
She means...
you picked a harder road.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.615
You'll find something.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.531
Drink the rum.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.533
It'll help.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.804
See?

01:52.764 --> 01:54.070
What was that?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.119
Look at your face.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.774
It's probably just
a deer or something.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.776
A deer's not gonna
kill you.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.257
That sounded a lot bigger
than a deer.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.695
Maybe it's
a really big deer.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.175
Guys.

02:12.219 --> 02:15.439
Look, you're nuts.
There's nothing out there.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.093
Oh, my God.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.791
Look, I'll prove it to you,
okay?

02:19.835 --> 02:21.271
I'm getting more rum.

02:29.671 --> 02:33.370
Okay. Don't really think
we need more rum.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.810
Julie?

02:41.857 --> 02:44.816
Julie?
Are you okay?

02:55.523 --> 02:57.568
No.

02:59.570 --> 03:00.615
No.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.244
-Aah!

03:46.661 --> 03:48.924
Hey.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.796
Supply run is done.

03:53.363 --> 03:57.193
Hey, you know they make
Ghost Pepper Jerky?

03:58.977 --> 04:01.066
Sam: Uh, you're not
gonna like it.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.895
What are you talking about?
I like all jerkies.

04:03.939 --> 04:07.769
Dude,
ghost peppers are really hot.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.162
Ah, please.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.210
Aha.

04:18.432 --> 04:21.913
Mm.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.657
How is it?

04:26.701 --> 04:27.876
It's good.

04:27.919 --> 04:28.920
It's really good.
I like it.

04:28.964 --> 04:32.054
Good --
Good flavor.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.229
Great.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.101
Uh, you should have
another piece.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.973
That's fine.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.759
Ooh. Thank you.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.195
Water.
You mind if I, uh...

04:50.202 --> 04:51.943
I'm...

04:51.987 --> 04:54.511
What?

04:54.555 --> 04:56.165
Huh?

04:58.123 --> 05:01.344
You want -- Okay?
Yeah. Sure.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.269
Ahh.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.966
Mountain lion.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.707
What?

05:16.751 --> 05:18.100
I didn't really,
uh, catch that.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.015
Will you say it again,
please?

05:21.886 --> 05:24.106
The mountain lion,
the case in Colorado

05:24.149 --> 05:26.413
with the moun--
with the mountain lion.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.371
Wait.
Say it one more time.The case in Colorado

05:28.415 --> 05:30.155
with the mountain lion
and the three dead.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.288
Where are we
with that one?

05:32.332 --> 05:36.292
Uh...we are at five.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.427
What?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.646
We're up to five.

05:45.954 --> 05:49.131
Then what are we doing here?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.831
Oh, sweet mother.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.964
Do you --
I'm gonna go
get ready for --

06:20.815 --> 06:22.207
Please forgive me.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.964
No.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.409
The Colt.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.067
Did you really think
that would work?

07:00.594 --> 07:03.684
Poor, faithful Dean.

07:03.727 --> 07:07.078
We both knew
it had to end this way.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.451
You okay?

07:31.494 --> 07:34.497
Yeah. Just a --

07:34.541 --> 07:36.934
Just a...bad dream.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.806
Gee. Another one?

07:40.198 --> 07:42.636
Dean: Well, why don't you
tell me about it?

07:42.679 --> 07:44.768
No. Come on.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.640
I'll, uh --
I'll Freud you.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.729
Dean: Keep me awake
till we hit Colorado.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.600
I'm fine.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.821
Alright.

08:05.354 --> 08:08.313
We're here.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.490
We going Fed?

08:10.533 --> 08:11.665
Nope.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.016
Fish and Wildlife.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.931
Fish and Wildlife?Yeah.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.368
Check these
bad boys out.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.897
Hamill and Ford?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.812
Wow.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.335
That is a deep cut.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.034
Look at you.
You look like a baby.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.471
Me?
Look at you.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.649
What?

08:39.693 --> 08:41.216
I look exactly the same.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.437
Like, nothing has changed.
It's...

08:46.700 --> 08:47.701
Nothing's changed.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.267
Yeah. Right.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.878
You --

08:56.448 --> 08:57.754
You the sheriff?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.147
That's what
the mug says.

09:01.410 --> 09:05.153
Uh, Fish and Wildlife,
Agent Ford and Hamill.

09:09.723 --> 09:12.029
This you?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.553
Obviously.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
Okay.

09:20.385 --> 09:24.476
Uh, we're here about the five,
um -- the mountain-lion attacks.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.566
If that's what
you want to call them.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.176
Is that not what you
want to call them?

09:28.219 --> 09:30.178
I don't know.
Maybe.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.875
We don't get many big cats
around here.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.355
We've had a few bears,

09:33.398 --> 09:35.183
but they don't do sustained
attacks like this.

09:35.226 --> 09:38.578
I mean, unless
the bear's psychotic.

09:38.621 --> 09:42.799
So, your two theories are
mountain lion or psychotic bear.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.368
Look, you ask me, these aren't
animal attacks at all.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.849
The scenes --
they're too clean.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.938
There's no parts torn off.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.592
I mean, we're still
working on this.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.245
We had to tell the papers
something.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.813
So you think a person
did this?

09:56.857 --> 09:59.468
If he did,
he's a monster.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.515
Yeah. Of course.

10:03.559 --> 10:04.908
Either way,
we need to be sure.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.257
Uh, do you have
any case files,

10:06.301 --> 10:08.303
any photographs of the bodies
we can look at?

10:08.346 --> 10:10.044
Sure.
I can get you those.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.262
And what about witnesses?

10:11.306 --> 10:14.135
There's one --
Ashley Monroe.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.919
She's not saying much.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.573
I think she's in shock.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.664
I mean, having your friend's
heart ripped out will do that.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.058
She's asked us to keep her name
out of the articles,

10:24.101 --> 10:26.756
you know,
because of the trauma.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.585
And where is she now?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.761
It all happened so fast.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.459
We understand, but...

10:34.503 --> 10:37.637
Ashley, do you remember
anything at all?

10:53.827 --> 10:55.132
I can't.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.485
Uh, sir?

11:00.529 --> 11:02.357
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions in the hall?

11:02.400 --> 11:05.665
Sure.

11:13.847 --> 11:17.764
Whatever you saw...

11:17.807 --> 11:18.808
we'll believe you.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.207
Ashley, listen to me.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.037
Whatever
you're about to say,

11:30.080 --> 11:33.170
I want you to know
that we've heard worse.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.694
We've heard of weirder.

11:40.569 --> 11:45.008
It -- It was a man...
who killed my friends.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.749
Okay.

11:48.403 --> 11:51.101
But it --
it wasn't a man.

11:51.145 --> 11:55.584
He -- He --
He had claws and fangs.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.070
A werewolf.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.029
Claws. Fangs.
It was a werewolf.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.552
No, no.
There's no such thing.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.207
I -- I must have been
hallucinating.

12:10.251 --> 12:13.733
You weren't.

12:16.474 --> 12:21.436
Werewolves, monsters --
they're all real.

12:21.479 --> 12:26.093
And me and my brother --
we hunt them, and we kill them.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.008
That's what we do.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.401
Oh, God.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.795
Hey.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.405
Whatever you're worried about,

12:34.449 --> 12:38.148
hey, whatever comes at you,
we will handle it.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.237
I promise you that.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.850
Now, this thing --
did you get a good look at it?

12:51.466 --> 12:55.209
You saw what we did
to your friends, right?

12:55.252 --> 12:56.514
Mm-hmm.

12:56.558 --> 13:00.997
Tell anyone about this,
you'll get worse.

13:09.353 --> 13:13.923
If I tell you...
you have to protect me.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.666
I promise you I will.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.801
Sir,
she was responsive?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.803
Nurse: Not at all,
but you know what?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.456
She'll be fine.
Just a minor concussion.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.502
Great.
Thank you for your time.Yep.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.157
So?
Andy May.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.375
What?

13:31.419 --> 13:34.291
That's the guy
that attacked Ashley.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.293
And he's a werewolf.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.904
Wait a second.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.123
The night Ashley was attacked,
there wasn't a full moon.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.472
Maybe a pure blood.

13:41.516 --> 13:44.301
Alright.
I'll find an address.

14:19.554 --> 14:23.166
Alright, so, Andy lives here
with his brother, Josh.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.951
He a wolf, too?

14:24.994 --> 14:26.561
One way to find out.

14:27.736 --> 14:28.737
Hi there.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.347
Yeah?

14:30.391 --> 14:32.959
Agents Ford and Hamill,
Fish and Wildlife.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.308
That's you?

14:39.182 --> 14:40.749
Are you Andy?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.272
No.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.578
Andy?

14:46.973 --> 14:49.410
Hi there. You mind if we have
a moment of your time?

14:49.453 --> 14:50.846
Can we say no?

14:52.456 --> 14:55.329
He's -- He's joking.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.157
We just don't have
a lot of visitors.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.246
Because we don't want
visitors.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.161
Right.
Well, we'll be quick.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.860
Tell me --
have you see this woman?

15:07.384 --> 15:09.256
I --Never seen her.

15:09.299 --> 15:13.434
What does, uh, that have to do
with Fish and Wildlife?

15:13.477 --> 15:15.871
She was attacked
three nights ago near here.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.264
Her friends were killed.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.918
She managed to get away.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.745
Huh.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.660
Paper said
that was a mountain lion.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.924
Right, yeah, that's one
of a few working theories.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.316
Hm.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.580
Uh, well, sometimes we go out
in the woods at night.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.366
Maybe we could help.
What exactly did you need?

15:32.409 --> 15:34.324
You go out in the woods
at night a lot?

15:34.368 --> 15:37.501
We set rabbit traps
at night.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.940
Haven't seen anything bigger
than a raccoon for years.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.593
Alright, then.
We'll get out of your hair.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.378
Just do me a favor.
Do you mind, um,

15:44.421 --> 15:45.640
writing down
your phone numbers

15:45.683 --> 15:47.598
so we can reach you
for a follow-up?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.689
We don't have a phone.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.564
If you need us,
we'll be here.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.700
Well, I say we just shoot them
right now, you know?

16:04.659 --> 16:08.097
Ashley?

16:08.141 --> 16:11.579
No, no, no. No, no.
We'll -- We'll be right there.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.420
"We go out in the woods
at night"?

16:29.597 --> 16:31.642
"Maybe we can help"?

16:31.686 --> 16:34.645
I-I-I didn't know
what to say.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.125
I would-- I wouldn't
have to say anything

16:36.169 --> 16:38.736
if you didn't kill
those girls.But I did.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.042
And you said
you got the other one.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.262
You said you ate her heart,
but -- but no.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.611
You let her live?

16:43.654 --> 16:45.482
I made her promise
not to tell.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.006
Oh, God,
that worked out great.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.834
I didn't want to hunt people
in the first place.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.011
Dad would never have --Dad is dead!

16:56.363 --> 16:58.974
Look, hey...

16:59.018 --> 17:03.065
if you don't want to
hunt people, we'll stop.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.026
You're lying.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.551
I don't lie to you.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.034
I look out for you.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.907
So we'll stop.

17:22.128 --> 17:29.961
But first, that Ashley girl,
she's got to go.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.093
Right?

17:53.811 --> 17:58.120
I'm sorry. I -- I didn't have
anyone else to call.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.905
I just couldn't be alone.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.908
No, it's, uh --
it's alright.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.999
Listen, why don't you take
our room, and, uh...

18:08.043 --> 18:10.219
We'll just grab
one of the rooms next door.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.613
There you go.Thank you.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.095
And then
we'll circle back

18:16.138 --> 18:19.359
and take down
the lumberjack twins, right?

18:19.402 --> 18:21.535
Sam? Right?

18:21.578 --> 18:23.493
Yeah. Right.

18:23.537 --> 18:27.193
I just -- This case -- I mean,
it -- it just feels weird.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.325
We -- We roll into town.
There's an eyewitness.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.935
We find them immediately.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.764
Doesn't it seem
a little too easy?

18:33.808 --> 18:36.898
Easy's good.
I like easy.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.337
Okay, um...
you gonna be alright?

18:41.381 --> 18:43.644
Yeah. Thanks.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.777
Actually...um...

18:46.821 --> 18:49.302
could you stay
with me?

18:49.345 --> 18:51.042
Just until
I fall asleep?

18:54.176 --> 18:56.309
Sure. Yeah.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.144
You sure?

19:06.493 --> 19:08.538
She's here.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.627
I can smell her.

19:12.977 --> 19:16.633
But so are those guys
who came out to the cabin.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.679
That's their car.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.945
Don't worry.

19:23.988 --> 19:27.166
We're good at quick
and quiet.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.395
Just had to splash some water
on my face, try to wake up.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.833
How are youdoing?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.226
Good.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.793
I'm tired.

19:45.836 --> 19:50.450
Those, um -- those pills the
hospital gave me really work.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.060
Yeah.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.239
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is the good stuff.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.854
Do you like your job?

20:04.725 --> 20:06.509
What do you mean?

20:06.553 --> 20:10.121
I mean...monsters.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.517
Right.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.867
Do I like it?

20:16.911 --> 20:20.219
Uh...

20:20.262 --> 20:22.221
I do.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.224
I mean, there's bad,
don't get wrong.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.008
There's a lot of bad.

20:28.096 --> 20:31.752
Still, it feels good
to help people.

20:31.795 --> 20:35.059
You know?

20:35.103 --> 20:37.236
Did you ever want to be
anything else?

20:37.279 --> 20:39.150
Jimi Hendrix.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.981
No, not really.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.986
I'm where
I'm supposed to be.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.554
That's nice.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.121
Hm.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.692
I just graduated college.

20:58.735 --> 21:01.347
Uh, we all did.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.087
My friends.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.220
We were celebrating,
actually.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.700
We've gone camping
together

21:06.743 --> 21:08.876
every year
since we were little girls.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.359
Now I don't even
have them.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.276
I just moved back here,

21:17.319 --> 21:20.409
and I have no idea
what I'm gonna do with my life.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.634
You got plenty of time.

21:36.947 --> 21:42.301
It's all just so random
and awful.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.869
Wouldn't it be great

21:45.913 --> 21:49.308
if everything was just
planned out for you...

21:51.875 --> 21:56.358
...if it was all
just already decided?

21:59.666 --> 22:02.146
No, not really.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.422
Sam: Dean?

22:16.465 --> 22:18.032
Hey, Dean.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.036
Where is she?

22:22.079 --> 22:24.734
D-- I don't know.
She was with you.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.953
What?

22:25.996 --> 22:27.128
Dean,
I just went out for food.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.390
I got back,
the door was open,

22:28.434 --> 22:30.653
she was gone,
and -- and you were sleeping.

22:30.697 --> 22:31.741
Dude, what the hell?

22:31.785 --> 22:34.788
You --
Come on!

22:44.058 --> 22:46.626
Andy: Okay, can we just talk
about this for two seconds?

22:46.669 --> 22:50.064
We have a plan.I know. It's just --

22:50.107 --> 22:51.848
I don't like
who we are now, Josh.

22:51.892 --> 22:54.285
This isn't who we are.

22:54.329 --> 22:57.376
This is exactly
who we are.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.292
And I want to eat
her heart.

23:07.081 --> 23:10.171
Yeah, no, look,
I get why we're here,

23:10.214 --> 23:12.434
but there is no way
those dumbasses took Ashley

23:12.478 --> 23:13.479
without me waking up.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.784
No way.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.648
Okay. You're okay.
You're alright.

23:52.692 --> 23:55.477
Okay.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.522
Thank you.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.132
Where are they?
Where are they?

23:58.175 --> 23:59.742
I-I don't know.
They ran.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.484
Okay, okay, okay, let's go.
Come on.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.138
Go. Go on.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.944
Hunters.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.773
I bet you even had
silver bullets in that gun.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.471
Well, you'd win that bet.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.601
Josh!

25:43.542 --> 25:46.588
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no. Hey. Hey.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.024
You don't have to do this.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.504
Alright?
You don't want to do this.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.207
He...

25:57.251 --> 25:59.079
He was my brother,

25:59.122 --> 26:01.168
and he promised,

26:01.211 --> 26:04.040
but he was
never gonna stop.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.175
And he turned into
a monster.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.270
And I'm a monster, too.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.634
You -- You good?

26:32.678 --> 26:33.896
Yeah.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.333
Yeah, that was --
that was weird.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.776
Hey, hey, you okay?

26:43.819 --> 26:45.255
Don't touch me.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.257
No!

26:50.565 --> 26:52.219
What?

26:59.269 --> 27:01.707
Well, this is a bitch.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.419
Oh.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.856
And I was doing
so well, too.

27:29.473 --> 27:30.997
What are you?

27:31.040 --> 27:34.609
Aw, Sam.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.352
You don't remember
little ol' me?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.280
Lilith?

27:56.805 --> 27:58.154
No.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.373
No. You're dead.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.636
Wasdead. Yeah.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.595
In the Empty,
sleeping the big sleep,

28:04.639 --> 28:07.207
until the boss
brought me back.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.948
The boss?

28:08.991 --> 28:10.514
Lucifer?

28:10.558 --> 28:11.472
God.

28:11.515 --> 28:13.474
I was supposed to
get rescued,

28:13.517 --> 28:16.738
and in a moment of sweet relief,
seduce Dean, blah, blah, blah.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.785
Obviously,
that's not happening...now?

28:19.828 --> 28:22.483
So...

28:22.526 --> 28:23.702
Oh, well.

28:25.355 --> 28:28.097
So, Chuck sent you
to kill us?

28:28.141 --> 28:29.969
No. I wish.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.753
That's not how
this story goes.

28:31.797 --> 28:32.798
Story?

28:32.841 --> 28:34.103
Come on.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.018
You know how he is.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.716
All this?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.369
Personally, I thought
the whole thing

28:39.413 --> 28:43.199
was kind of...
easy...stupid?

28:43.243 --> 28:47.813
But I batted my eyes,
and I put Dean to sleep.

28:49.771 --> 28:54.733
Made sure you guys saw those
two mutts go all murder-suicide.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.386
So, yeah.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.780
Alright,
if you're not here to kill us,

28:58.824 --> 28:59.999
then what do you want?

29:00.042 --> 29:01.740
The magic gun.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.306
The one he gave you.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.960
The Equalizer.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.657
I'm not calling it that.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.618
Just give me the gun,
and we'll be done.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.187
If God wants
his little toy back,

29:14.230 --> 29:16.580
he can come get it
himself.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.582
Oh. Okay.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.802
We're gonna do this
the hard way.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.369
I love the hard way.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.895
Demon blade.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.900
Angel blade.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.554
You upgraded.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.643
Lady,
you have no idea.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.793
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, don't touch him.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.104
Fine, you want the gun?
I'll show you where it is.

30:02.888 --> 30:06.195
Oh, you would promise a girl
the moon,

30:06.239 --> 30:07.893
wouldn't you,
Dean Winchester?

30:07.936 --> 30:11.940
I should've spent more time
with youthe last go-around.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.465
But what if you're lying?

30:16.902 --> 30:18.425
Then you can kill me.

30:19.078 --> 30:21.820
Except, like I said,
I can't.

30:23.952 --> 30:26.825
Still, a girl has needs.

30:26.868 --> 30:30.829
So if this is just
some desperate attempt

30:30.872 --> 30:34.484
to save poor Sam,

30:34.528 --> 30:36.312
by the time
I'm through with you,

30:36.356 --> 30:39.185
you'll be begging
to die.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.711
So are you sure?

30:45.713 --> 30:47.193
Yeah, I am.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.457
Deal.

31:23.403 --> 31:26.623
Dean, hey,
s-stop, stop, okay?

31:26.667 --> 31:29.278
This isn't you.
Okay?

31:37.939 --> 31:40.333
No, no, no, no, no.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.622
Why?

32:08.665 --> 32:10.580
Just why?

32:10.624 --> 32:13.888
Well, because,
of the three potential vessels,

32:13.932 --> 32:15.324
Ashley had
the best hair.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.371
No,
why are you doing this?

32:18.414 --> 32:20.677
You even said it yourself
this is stupid.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.984
It is.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.247
Do you think
I wantto be here?

32:25.291 --> 32:27.946
I died to free Lucifer
from the Cage.

32:29.121 --> 32:32.254
I had to die
for what I wanted most.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.083
And then you two went
and screwed it all up.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.390
Yeah, but that was --
that was God, too, right?

32:37.433 --> 32:38.782
I mean, just another one
of his stories?

32:38.826 --> 32:41.089
Yeah, well,
I can't hurt him.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.265
But I can hurt you.

32:59.107 --> 33:00.674
Dean: I don't get it.
Why the games?

33:00.717 --> 33:02.241
What?

33:02.284 --> 33:05.418
You didn't like the part
when you bonded with the victim?

33:10.510 --> 33:13.992
"Wouldn't it be great
if everything was just...

33:14.035 --> 33:17.038
planned out for you?"

33:19.693 --> 33:20.824
Ah.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.565
Let me guess.
One of Chuck's lines?

33:22.609 --> 33:23.958
Word for word.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.266
God -- He is not exactly
Shakespeare.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.182
He's more of
a low-rent Dean Koontz.

33:30.225 --> 33:36.318
I had to listen to his whole
"writing philosophy,"

33:36.362 --> 33:40.366
and his very weird,
very perv-y obsession with you.

33:41.367 --> 33:46.850
And it always ends the same --
one brother killing the other.

33:46.894 --> 33:49.679
I mean, this world?

33:49.723 --> 33:55.076
He could've ended it in so many
ways, and he likes that one.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.644
You know,
I guess that's why

33:57.687 --> 34:00.777
you had to see the werewolf bros
die the way they did

34:00.821 --> 34:03.693
'cause...foreshadowing.

34:12.572 --> 34:16.315
So, here we are.

34:16.358 --> 34:20.536
Now, be a good boy
and show me that big gun, huh?

34:21.668 --> 34:23.844
You know what?

34:23.887 --> 34:25.324
It's on me.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.065
I forgot.
We didn't actually bring it.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.371
Sorry.

34:33.506 --> 34:36.552
Have you ever heard
of Lingchi?

34:36.596 --> 34:38.424
It's Chinese.

34:38.467 --> 34:43.298
It means "lingering death" --
death by a thousand cuts.

34:46.258 --> 34:47.433
Where is the gun?

34:51.785 --> 34:53.047
Go to hell.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.963
Ohh.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.399
Ah!

34:57.443 --> 35:00.228
I can make this last
for a really long time, Dean.

35:00.272 --> 35:03.318
I can make it last
almost forever.

35:04.493 --> 35:05.625
Tell me.

35:24.470 --> 35:27.386
You...

35:27.429 --> 35:28.343
What?!

35:28.387 --> 35:31.129
Devil's Trap bullet.
We upgraded.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.480
Dean, you good?

35:34.523 --> 35:37.483
Nothing that a box
of Band-Aids can't fix.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.443
Where's Chuck?

35:41.487 --> 35:44.403
Why would I
ever tell you anything?

35:44.446 --> 35:46.274
Because I've killed you
before...

35:48.929 --> 35:50.191
...and I can do it again.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.585
See,
you keep saying that,

35:52.628 --> 35:55.283
but you killed me
because I let you.

35:55.327 --> 35:59.200
Now I'm feeling
less generous.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.252
Let's move.

36:12.779 --> 36:13.997
Wait.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.521
That shot ain't gonna
hold her forever, man.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.436
We got to get.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.657
Dean, I can't move.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.659
Oh, crap.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.444
Sucks, doesn't it?

36:27.620 --> 36:29.752
You're never
getting that gun.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.233
Sure, I am.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.670
See, you boys left
that room so fast

36:34.714 --> 36:36.368
you had no time
to grab anything.

36:36.411 --> 36:40.328
So the gun
was never there.

36:40.372 --> 36:45.333
Would you really take
something like that home?

36:46.726 --> 36:50.556
I mean,
what if you needed it, hmm?

36:52.514 --> 36:56.301
So it's not
in the room...

36:57.389 --> 37:00.218
...and it's not
in the bunker.

37:12.186 --> 37:13.318
-No, no, no, no.
=Come on.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.189
No, no, no, please.

37:35.035 --> 37:38.821
Ohh, well,
this was fun.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.345
You know what?

37:40.388 --> 37:41.868
Go ahead and take it.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.130
We'll get it back.

37:43.173 --> 37:44.914
Will you?

38:02.541 --> 38:05.500
Thank you, boys.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.764
See ya soon.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.784
That Cass?

38:30.264 --> 38:33.093
Yeah, straight
to voicemail -- again.

38:33.136 --> 38:36.401
Yeah, well, we gave him the
heads up on Chuck and Lilith.

38:36.444 --> 38:40.709
So, what else
are we supposed to do?

38:49.370 --> 38:51.329
He was
supposed to be gone.

38:52.634 --> 38:55.158
God was
supposed to be gone.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.291
Yeah.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.991
So, what, we're just --
we're stuck in his --

39:02.035 --> 39:04.342
in his maze still?

39:04.385 --> 39:06.169
And now Lilith
is back?

39:06.213 --> 39:07.345
I mean,
what's he gonna do,

39:07.388 --> 39:08.868
just throw
our greatest hits at us?

39:10.391 --> 39:11.697
I mean...

39:11.740 --> 39:14.308
why doesn't he
just kill us already?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.179
Because that's not
what he wants.

39:18.530 --> 39:26.494
Lilith said that Chuck
only likes one kind of ending --

39:26.538 --> 39:28.757
you kill me,
or I kill you.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.195
What?

39:32.239 --> 39:34.197
Yeah.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.938
Well,
that'snot happening.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.680
Dean.

39:38.724 --> 39:45.600
My...dreams, visions,
or whatever --

39:45.644 --> 39:50.562
they all end the same way,
with us killing each other.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.870
You're just
telling me this now?

39:54.914 --> 39:57.482
I-I-I thought, uh,
they must've been some form

39:57.525 --> 40:00.920
of, like, messed-up PTSD,
but...

40:00.963 --> 40:02.225
but what if they're not?

40:02.269 --> 40:07.709
What if I'm somehow
seeing Chuck's endings?

40:07.753 --> 40:09.494
You know,
different ones.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.930
How would that
be possible?

40:14.455 --> 40:15.804
'Cause of this.

40:15.848 --> 40:19.721
When I shot Chuck,
the bullet wasn't a bullet.

40:19.765 --> 40:23.551
It w-- it was a-a --
a piece of me, right?

40:23.595 --> 40:26.946
So, what if it created
a-a link of some sort, you know?

40:26.989 --> 40:31.516
I-I mean, what if --
what if, I don't know...

40:31.559 --> 40:34.736
What if somehow
I'm in his head?

40:39.698 --> 40:42.004
This was
supposed to be over.

40:45.138 --> 40:47.401
We were done.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.447
We were free.

40:49.490 --> 40:52.101
And now...

40:55.365 --> 40:57.455
What are we
supposed to do, man?

41:01.676 --> 41:05.332
Do we just keep running
in this -- this...

41:05.375 --> 41:07.987
freaking hamster wheel
until we die?

41:09.554 --> 41:13.079
Or until we get boring
and he ends us?

41:14.776 --> 41:15.951
Or we fight.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.087
Fight God?

41:22.915 --> 41:25.874
Without the gun?

41:25.918 --> 41:27.441
It's God, Sam.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.445
And he's coming for us.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.448
How the hell are we
supposed to fight God?
