00:01.835 --> 00:04.105
DUNDER MIFFLIN,
THIS IS ROLANDO.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.174
OH, YES, SHE'S BEEN
EXPECTING YOUR CALL.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.679
(woman)
YEAH.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.814
KAREN?
HE'S ON LINE ONE.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.049
THANKS, RO.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.653
HEY. WE FINALLY CONNECTED.
HOW'S SCRANTON?

00:19.687 --> 00:23.157
I AM THE REGIONAL MANAGER
OF DUNDER MIFFLIN, UTICA BRANCH.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.193
TURNS OUT
IT'S A PRETTY EASY GIG

00:25.226 --> 00:26.560
WHEN YOUR BOSS
ISN'T AN IDIOT

00:26.594 --> 00:28.829
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
NOT IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.599
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS IT WOULD
BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY,

00:31.632 --> 00:34.102
AND WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
COME ABOARD.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.569
SO THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.172
OKAY, BYE.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.841
LOOK, FOR THE RECORD,

00:40.874 --> 00:44.278
A CERTAIN SCRANTON
SALESMAN APPROACHED ME, OKAY?

00:44.312 --> 00:45.679
(Michael)
THIS IS PERFECT!

00:45.713 --> 00:47.448
(Dwight)
HE LOOKS LIKE YOUR TWIN.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.782
(Michael)
THIS IS A DUMMY,

00:48.816 --> 00:50.251
A LA FERRIS BUELLER'S
DAY OFF.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.819
WE HAVE TIED A STRING
TO THE WRIST

00:51.852 --> 00:53.087
WHICH GOES TO THE DOOR.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.555
WHEN SOMEBODY
OPENS THE DOOR,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.090
THE HAND GOES DOWN,
HITS THE REMOTE,

00:56.124 --> 00:57.191
TURNS ON THE TAPE RECORDER,

00:57.225 --> 00:59.193
WHICH IS ME SNORING.
[snoring]

00:59.227 --> 01:01.795
NOW NOBODY KNOWS
WHETHER I AM HERE

01:01.829 --> 01:03.131
OR WHETHER I AM GONE.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.598
I WILL KNOW.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.167
BUT YOU WILL NOT
TELL ANYONE.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.568
I WON'T NEED TO,

01:07.601 --> 01:09.337
'CAUSE WE'LL BE TOGETHER
PLAYIN' HOOKY!

01:09.370 --> 01:10.504
YEAH!
WELL, SOMETIMES.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.406
MOST OF THE TIME,
I WILL BE WITH RYAN.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.774
OR DARRYL.

01:13.807 --> 01:14.608
[knocking]
YES.

01:14.642 --> 01:15.509
OH, GOOD, GOOD, STANLEY!
FIRST VICTIM.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.778
THIS IS WHAT I WANT
YOU TO DO.
[snoring]

01:17.811 --> 01:20.114
GO OUT, COME BACK IN.
WE'RE GONNA HIDE.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.749
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
IF THIS LOOKS LIKE ME, OKAY?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.617
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SLEEPING AT YOUR DESK

01:23.651 --> 01:24.852
IS BETTER THAN
YOU NOT BEING HERE.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.720
JUST GO OUT
AND COME BACK IN.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.124
I GOT AN OFFER FROM UTICA
FOR MORE MONEY.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.492
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.494
[snoring]
WHAT?

01:33.527 --> 01:35.163
[door closes]

01:35.196 --> 01:38.166
[cheerful music]

01:38.199 --> 01:46.207
*

02:07.828 --> 02:11.165
HEY, EVERYONE, CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.766
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU ALL SHOULD KNOW

02:12.800 --> 02:15.736
THAT STANLEY HUDSON
IS PLANNING ON LEAVING US

02:15.769 --> 02:19.173
BECAUSE OUR OLD FRIEND KAREN
FROM UTICA

02:19.207 --> 02:21.642
IS GOING TO GIVE HIM
MORE MONEY TO WORK THERE.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.843
OKAY!
THAT'S GREAT.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.313
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO-NO, NO, NO.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.848
YOU COMPLETELY
MISINTERPRETED MY TONE.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.517
THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.386
CLEARLY, KAREN IS TRYING
TO GET BACK AT US

02:32.420 --> 02:34.455
BECAUSE JIM DUMPED HER.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.856
OH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.359
OKAY, WELL, SMARTY PANTS.
THEN WHY?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.929
WHY IS SHE TRYING
TO TAKE STANLEY FROM US?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.931
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
OF MY SALES RECORD.

02:43.964 --> 02:47.235
THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY
BE IT.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.637
YOU CANNOT TAKE
THE HILARIOUS BLACK GUY

02:49.670 --> 02:51.505
FROM THE OFFICE.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.242
STANLEY IS PART OF WHAT MAKES
THIS BRANCH SO EXTRAORDINARY.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.844
THE BLUESY WISDOM.
THE SASSY REMARKS.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.547
THE CROSSWORD PUZZLES.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.883
THE SMILE.
THOSE BIG, WATERY RED EYES.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.786
I DON'T KNOW HOW GEORGE BUSH
DID IT WHEN COLIN POWELL LEFT.

03:05.819 --> 03:09.323
AND IF UTICA THINKS THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO POACH STANLEY,

03:09.357 --> 03:11.259
THEY HAVE ANOTHER THINK COMING.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.632
HOW CAN I GET YOU
TO STAY?

03:18.666 --> 03:19.733
MONEY.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.803
YEAH.
WE ALL WANT MONEY.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.573
BUT THERE IS NONE
IN THE BUDGET, SO...

03:25.606 --> 03:27.408
TELL ME WHY
YOU'RE REALLY LEAVING.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.976
MONEY.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.644
MO MONEY, MO PROBLEMS,
STANLEY.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.346
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.981
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.516
IF I WERE--

03:35.549 --> 03:36.884
MONEY.
PSSH. 'KAY.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.987
[whispering]
OSCAR.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.856
DID YOU BRING IT?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.858
TO BE EDWARDIAN.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.394
HIS BEST WORK.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.528
OKAY, WELL, I HAVE
THE TABLECLOTH.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.529
DON'T FORGET THE FLATWARE.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.830
SURE THING, PAM.
CAN'T WAIT.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.999
OSCAR, TOBY, AND I
ARE FOUNDING MEMBERS

03:52.032 --> 03:54.602
OF THE FINER THINGS CLUB.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.505
WE MEET ONCE A MONTH
TO DISCUSS BOOKS AND ART,

03:57.538 --> 04:00.408
CELEBRATE CULTURE
IN A VERY CIVILIZED WAY.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.311
SOMETIMES THE DEBATE
CAN GET HEATED.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.913
BUT WE'RE ALWAYS RESPECTFUL.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.915
THERE IS NO PAPER,
NO PLASTIC,

04:07.948 --> 04:09.950
AND NO WORK TALK ALLOWED.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.454
IT'S VERY EXCLUSIVE.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.423
BESIDES HAVING SEX
WITH MEN,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.890
I WOULD SAY
THE FINER THINGS CLUB

04:16.924 --> 04:18.926
IS THE GAYEST THING
ABOUT ME.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.794
[Spring from
Vivaldi's Four Seasons plays]

04:20.828 --> 04:23.631
SO TELL ME AGAIN WHY
I CAN'T BE A PART OF YOUR CLUB.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.832
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK

04:24.865 --> 04:25.933
THAT YOU MONOPOLIZE
THE CONVERSATION

04:25.966 --> 04:28.469
BY TRYING TO BE FUNNY.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.637
OSCAR?

04:29.670 --> 04:30.838
SOME PEOPLE.

04:30.871 --> 04:31.972
(Karen)
HELLO?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.874
FILIPELLERS,
HOW THEY HANGIN'?

04:33.907 --> 04:35.843
MICHAEL.
TO THE LEFT?
TO THE RIGHT?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.578
LISTEN, I-I'M REALLY--

04:37.611 --> 04:38.912
OKAY, ENOUGH SMALL TALK.
GO AHEAD.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.913
YOU CALLED ME.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.949
YES. LISTEN.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.016
UM...

04:43.050 --> 04:46.019
YOU CANNOT TEAR STANLEY
FROM HIS FAMILY LIKE THIS.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.855
I'M PRETTY SURE HIS FAMILY'S
COMING WITH HIM.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.089
NO, HIS WORK FAMILY.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.592
LOOK, THIS IS VERY
HARD FOR ME,

04:51.625 --> 04:53.527
BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU MY BEST MAN.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.962
YOU MAY HAVE TOBY.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.797
TOBY'S NOT A SALESPERSON.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.767
YOU CAN TRAIN HIM.
HE'S VERY, VERY SMART.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.802
AND FUNNY, AND CHARMING.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.003
AHH...OOH.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.406
YOU KNOW--
I CAN'T DO IT.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.640
TOBY IS THE WORST.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.908
THAT--
THAT WAS A BLUFF.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.410
UM...

05:09.443 --> 05:12.446
LISTEN, IF YOU ARE
GOING TO POACH ONE OF MY GUYS,

05:12.480 --> 05:13.947
I AM GOING TO POACH
ONE OF YOURS.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.883
OOH!
GOOD-BYE, MICHAEL.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.818
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.
WAIT, WAIT!

05:17.851 --> 05:19.453
KAREN.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.755
COULD YOU TRANSFER ME TO ONE
OF YOUR SALESPEOPLE, PLEASE?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.824
YOUR BEST ONE?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.459
[Karen hangs up]

05:25.493 --> 05:27.595
I HAVE BEN NUGENT
ON THE LINE.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.430
HE IS THE TOP SALESMAN
IN UTICA.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.764
HI, BEN.
MICHAEL SCOTT.

05:30.798 --> 05:31.899
(Ben)
HI, MICHAEL.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.034
I'M GOING TO CUT
RIGHT TO THE CHASE HERE.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.003
DO YOU LIKE MAGIC?

05:36.036 --> 05:38.038
BECAUSE I AM
A GENIE IN A BOTTLE,

05:38.071 --> 05:39.907
AND I'M GOING TO GRANT YOU
THREE WISHES--

05:39.940 --> 05:43.677
TO MOVE TO SCRANTON,
TO HAVE A GREAT JOB,

05:43.711 --> 05:45.413
AND TO BE MY BEST FRIEND.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.580
AREN'T YOU THE GUY

05:46.614 --> 05:48.782
THAT HIT THE WOMAN
WITH YOUR CAR?

05:48.816 --> 05:49.850
[low voice]
GET OUT.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.453
UH, YEAH.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.488
I ALSO SAVED HER LIFE.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.624
BUT I GUESS
THAT'S NOT AS GRABBY.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.493
EVERYONE SAYS SCRANTON BRANCH
IS WORSE THAN CAMDEN.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.796
DIDN'T EVERYONE FROM STAMFORD
QUIT, LIKE IMMEDIATELY?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.965
NO, I FIRED THEM.
AND YOU'RE NEXT.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.404
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

06:10.438 --> 06:11.705
SERIOUSLY?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.674
(Michael)
WHAT IS THAT GUY
TALKING ABOUT?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.643
SCRANTON IS NOT LAME.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.111
SCRANTON IS THE COOL,
FUN BRANCH.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.481
WE'RE LIKE ANIMAL HOUSE.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.683

FOUND HIM!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.552

06:24.585 --> 06:26.920
WE'RE GETTING CRAPPED ON.
WORD IS OUR BRANCH SUCKS.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.822
AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.990
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

06:30.023 --> 06:30.758
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.560
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
A MONSTER SALE

06:32.593 --> 06:34.027
IS WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.028
CORCORAN
DROPPED STAPLES.

06:35.062 --> 06:35.763
DID THEY?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.731
YES, THEY DID.
OH, YES, THEY DID.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.633
AND WE ARE GOING
TO MURDE IT!

06:39.667 --> 06:40.834
YOU, ME, DWIGHT,

06:40.868 --> 06:41.935
ARE GOING TO JUMP INTO
MY PT CRUISER.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.672
[Vivaldi playing]
WE ARE GOING TO CRUSH
THIS SALE.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.839
WE ARE GOING TO PROVE--

06:45.873 --> 06:47.908
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT MUSIC?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.611
IT'S VIVALDI.
FOR FINER THINGS.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.112
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.781
WE NEED ROCK AND ROLL,
PAM.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.082
ROCK AND ROLL!

06:55.115 --> 06:56.817

OH...MY...

06:59.186 --> 07:01.589
[whispers]
GOD.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.891
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
ARE LEAVING.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.695
I--

07:07.728 --> 07:09.463
I HAVE NO WORDS.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.077
WE JUST PASSED
THE EXIT FOR CORCORAN.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.079
WHAT? WHAT?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.782
SURPRISE!
YAAH!

07:28.816 --> 07:30.017

YES, LOOK AT HIS FACE!

07:31.919 --> 07:34.054
LOOK AT HIS FACE!

WHAT ARE WE DOING, DWIGHT?
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.726
OH, WELL, GEE, JIM,
I DON'T KNOW.

A PANTY RAID TO UTICA

WE'RE GOING TO UTICA?

07:45.866 --> 07:48.035
UH-HUH!
[crazed laughter]

07:48.068 --> 07:49.036
I'M NOT GOING
TO UTICA RIGHT NOW.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.203
YES, YOU ARE.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.204
OH, BUCKLE UP, JIM.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.906
NO.

07:52.940 --> 07:53.874
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE KAREN

WISH THAT SHE HAD NEVER
BEEN DUMPED BY YOU.

GAH! HAH! GA-HAH!

08:17.230 --> 08:18.832
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:18.866 --> 08:20.568
NO COMMUNICATION
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, JIM.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.604
IT HAD TO BE DONE.
IT HAD TO BE DONE.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.838
WELL, THAT KINDA SUCKS.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.542
BECAUSE IT HAD ALL THE PHOTOS
OF MY BROTHER'S NEW BABY ON IT.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.710
SO...

08:29.743 --> 08:32.913
OH, NO.
THAT IS TOO BAD.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.214
SHOOT.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.224
OKAY.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.959
HEY, DWIGHT,
HE FOUND IT.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.561
(Jim)
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:47.595 --> 08:49.196
I'M JUST GONNA CALL A CAB
FROM HERE.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.164
ALL RIGHT--YOU'RE GONNA MISS
THE BEST PRANK EVER.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.833
ALL RIGHT.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.070
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING?

08:59.072 --> 09:00.207
DO YOU REALLY
WANNA KNOW?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.575
OH, GOD.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.710
FOLLOW ME.
COME HERE.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.044
HERE'S WHAT WE BROUGHT.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.013
WE BROUGHT UNIFORMS
FROM THE WAREHOUSE.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.581
I BROUGHT SILLY STRING.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.717
DWIGHT BROUGHT GASOLINE
AND CHUNKS OF RUBBER

09:09.750 --> 09:10.818
TO MAKE STINK BOMBS.

09:10.851 --> 09:11.985
OR REAL BOMBS.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.854
NO, NO.
NOT REAL BOMBS.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.056
YEAH, COME ON.
IT'LL BE SO BADASS.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.925
UH, MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.026
I DON'T KNOW.
NO.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.027
COULD BE BADASS.
WELL...

09:20.060 --> 09:21.595
YEAH, IT WILL!

09:21.629 --> 09:23.230
ABSOLUTELY,
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.232
COME ON! I ALREADY FILLED
THE BOTTLES WITH THE GAS.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.000
IT'S GONNA BE SO BADASS!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.168
WE'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND

09:28.201 --> 09:29.770
WITH THIS IN THE TRUNK
THE WHOLE TIME?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.839
(Michael)
TEACH HER TO OFFER
STANLEY MORE MONEY.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.274
[makes explosive sound]

09:34.307 --> 09:36.710
SO...THE DEAL WAS,

09:36.744 --> 09:39.046
DWIGHT
DOESN'T BLOW ANYTHING UP,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.748
AND I WEAR A COSTUME.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.717
AND A MOUSTACHE.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.922
SO WHY DID YOU AND KAREN
BREAK UP?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.724
WAS IT THE SEX?
WHAT?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.926
I CAN'T IMAGINE
THE SEX BEING BAD.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.994
I MEAN, HER BODY IS...
OKAY.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.063
YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY DON'T WE
PLAY THAT ALPHABET GAME

09:56.096 --> 09:57.364
THAT YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.365
OKAY. I WILL START.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.634
UM..."A."

10:00.668 --> 10:04.104
[chanting]
"A," MY NAME IS ALAN,
AND MY WIFE'S NAME IS ALICE.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.274
WE LIVE IN ALASKA,
AND WE SELL...

10:07.307 --> 10:09.109
DAMN IT.
WHAT DO WE SELL?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.310
UM...

10:10.343 --> 10:11.945
DOESN'T MATTER.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.180
I'M TRYING TO THINK
OF WHAT WE COULD SELL.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.214
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.083
AH LA LA LA.
WHAT IS THAT?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.318
[liquid splashing]
THAT SOUND...

10:18.351 --> 10:21.021
THE AIR CONDITIONING
LEAKING OR SOMETHING?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.190
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
IT COULDN'T BE.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.058
[liquid splashing]
WHAT IS THAT?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.194
[splashing]

10:27.227 --> 10:29.129
DWIGHT,
ARE YOU PEEING?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.198
I'M PEEING
IN THIS EMPTY CAN.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.365
OH, MY GOD!
OH, COME ON!

10:32.399 --> 10:34.034
THAT IS DISGUSTING, DWIGHT.

10:34.067 --> 10:34.935
YOU SAID WE COULDN'T
MAKE ANY MORE STOPS,

10:34.968 --> 10:35.936
AND I REALLY HAD TO GO.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.170
WATCH THE ROAD!

10:37.204 --> 10:39.006
HEY, YOU'RE MAKING ME
SPRAY!

10:39.039 --> 10:40.307
I'LL KILL YOU, MAN!
OH, MY GOD!

10:40.340 --> 10:41.709
MICHAEL, MICHAEL,
PULL OVER.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.310
THAT IS JUST
SO DISGUSTING!

10:43.343 --> 10:45.713
I THINK I CUT MY PENIS
ON THE LID.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.115
CAN YOU IMAGINE A LIFE
WHERE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

10:48.148 --> 10:50.884
IS SUMMER
IN THE ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE?

10:50.918 --> 10:51.785
I KNOW, RIGHT?

10:51.819 --> 10:54.121
I JUST WANNA GO
AND LOOK AT ART AND...

10:54.154 --> 10:55.956
SWIM IN THE ADRIATIC.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.725
AND SPEND TIME
WITH GEORGE EMERSON.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.026
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.794
I MEAN, IT'S THE BEST
MALE PROTAGONIST

11:00.828 --> 11:02.029
WE'VE READ, RIGHT?

11:02.062 --> 11:02.896
TOTALLY!

11:02.930 --> 11:04.397
I MEAN, COME ON,
SUCH A FREE SPIRIT.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.933
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:05.966 --> 11:09.903
JUST CAME TO DISCUSS
MY FAVORITE E.M. FORSTER NOVEL.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.139
PAM, THESE FINGER SANDWICHES

11:12.172 --> 11:15.342
LOOK FINGER-LICKIN'
DELICIOUS, PAM.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.911
UM, I'M SORRY, ANDY,
BUT THIS IS A CLOSED CLUB.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.851
THE FINER THINGS CLUB

11:23.884 --> 11:26.419
IS THE MOST EXCLUSIVE CLUB
IN THIS OFFICE.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.789
NATURALLY,
IT'S WHERE I NEED TO BE.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.858
THE PARTY PLANNING COMMITTEE
IS MY BACKUP,

11:30.891 --> 11:33.060
AND KEVIN'S BAND
IS MY SAFETY.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.795
FINE.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.831
I'LL JUST...

11:39.232 --> 11:42.803
SIT HERE...
IN THE COMMON AREA

11:42.836 --> 11:44.204
AND READ MY BOOK.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.305
WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE

11:45.338 --> 11:47.941
THE VERY SAME BOOK
YOU'RE READING.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.410
ALL RIGHT, JUST KNOW YOU'RE NOT
IN THE FINER THINGS CLUB.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.445
WHY CAN'T I BE IN THE CLUB?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.948
(Jim)
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE HERE.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.917
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.085
(Dwight)
BELIEVE IT.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.820
AFRO WIG?
DO YOU WANT THE AFRO WIG?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.188
NO, MICHAEL, I'M NOT
LEAVING THE CAR.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.123
GOD. ALL RIGHT, DWIGHT.
YEAH.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.525
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO DOWN.
YOU AND I--

12:05.558 --> 12:07.995
[whispering]
GUY'S GOING BY. SHH.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.830
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
SNEAK INSIDE.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.865
WE WILL PRETEND
THAT WE ARE WAREHOUSE WORKERS,

12:11.899 --> 12:13.901
AND WE WILL SILLY STRING
THE BEJESUS OUT OF THE PLACE.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.435
AND IF WE HAVE
TO DEFEND OURSELVES,

12:15.468 --> 12:17.337
I WILL STAB THE SECURITY
GUARD IN THE EYE

12:17.370 --> 12:18.505
WITH THE JUMBO CHALK.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.407
NO! NO, YOU WON'T
DO THAT. NOPE.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.775
THEN I'LL GRIND UP
THE JUMBO CHALK

12:21.809 --> 12:23.210
AND BLOW IT
IN HIS EYES.

12:23.243 --> 12:27.014
DWIGHT, NOTHING
WITH THE EYES. PLEASE?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.782
[whispers]
OKAY, JIM.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.517
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S HER.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.352
THAT'S HER, GO, GO, GO!

12:32.385 --> 12:33.987
(Dwight)
LET'S MOVE, MOVE,
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

12:34.021 --> 12:35.355
SHUT UP!
YOU...SHUT UP.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.890
THIS IS THE DUMBEST
THING WE'VE EVER DONE.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.002
(Pam)
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING
HOW FORSTER USES

12:49.036 --> 12:52.272
ITALY TO REPRESENT SEXUALITY
AND PASSION.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.809
[coins clanking]
AND THAT ALSO BROUGHT UP
THEMES OF, UH...

12:55.843 --> 12:57.811
YOU KNOW,
FATE AND COINCIDENCE.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.013
AND LUCY'S TORN
BETWEEN THESE TWO THINGS.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.414
SHE'S TORN BETWEEN
PASSION AND CONVENTION.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.483
DAMN IT!

13:03.516 --> 13:05.318
IT JUST--

13:09.556 --> 13:12.092
TO BE MAKING THE CASE
FOR PASSION IN EDWARDIAN TIMES,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.427
I THOUGHT WAS, UH...
YES!

13:18.065 --> 13:19.466
DAMN IT.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.568
[banging machine]

13:21.601 --> 13:23.136
MADE HIM SORT OF
AHEAD OF HIS TIME AS A WRITER.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.237
[microwave beeping]
VERY BRAVE.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.474
VERY BRAVE CHOICE
I THOUGHT ALSO.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.076
AND GEORGE, HIS--
HIS YOUTHFULNESS,

13:29.109 --> 13:31.278
HIS, UM, FREEDOM
[microwave beeping]

13:31.311 --> 13:34.281
UM, EVOKES, UM...
[beep beep]

13:34.314 --> 13:36.083
[beep beep beep beep beep]
FEELINGS,

13:36.116 --> 13:37.150
UM...

13:37.184 --> 13:39.552
TO THE, UM...
[beep beep beep]

13:39.586 --> 13:41.354
[shouts]
WHAT ARE YOU MICROWAVING?!

13:41.388 --> 13:42.422
POPCORN.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.891
WHY DON'T YOU USE
THE MICROWAVE

13:43.924 --> 13:45.025
IN THE KITCHEN, PHYLLIS?

13:45.058 --> 13:46.426
SOMEONE NEEDS TO CLEAN IT.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.361
IT SMELLS LIKE POPCORN.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.999
[microwave whirring]

13:54.968 --> 13:57.437
SO, STANLEY,
YOU REALLY OUTTA HERE?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.973
YEP. LOOKS THAT WAY.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.076
I'M GONNA
MISS YOU, MAN.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.978
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE
AN UNCLE TO ME.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.514
LIKE A KIND OLD...

14:07.547 --> 14:09.883
UNCLE REMUS.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.052
I WANNA STAY IN TOUCH.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.991
[Michael, over walkie-talkie]
WE ARE IN A STAIRWELL.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.527
(Dwight)
WE ARE CLIMBING SOME STAIRS.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.295
[panting]

14:22.329 --> 14:23.931
I'M BREATHING HEAVILY.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.797
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:24.831 --> 14:26.333
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO BE
UPDATING ME

14:26.366 --> 14:27.968
AS MUCH AS YOU'RE
UPDATING ME.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.602
(Michael)
THERE'S A GUY.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.971
(Dwight)
THERE'S A SECURITY GUARD
COMING BY.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.473
HELLO,
WE'RE WAREHOUSE WORKERS.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.641
WOULD YOU LIKE MORE PROOF?

14:34.674 --> 14:36.209
[Michael exhaling]

14:36.243 --> 14:37.978
(Michael)
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS VERY CLOSE.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.546
(Dwight)
I CAN SEE
THE SECURITY GUARD'S EYES.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.915
NO. NO. DON'T DO
ANYTHING TO THEM.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.451
(Dwight)
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO HIS EYES!

14:44.484 --> 14:47.654
THE EYES...
ARE THE GROIN OF THE HEAD.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.056
ALL RIGHT, GREAT SCOTT.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.623
IF YOU FOUND THAT
CHOKING HAZARD POSTER,

14:50.657 --> 14:51.992
JUST HEAD ON HOME.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.327
(Michael)
WE GOT SOMETHING FAR BETTER.
THEIR CROWN JEWEL.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.130
THEIR INDUSTRIAL COPIER.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.665
ISN'T THAT THING HUGE?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.000
(Dwight)
IT'S ENORMOUS.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.501
BUT IT'S GOT WHEELS.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.070
WE'RE WHEELING IT
DOWN THE HALL

15:03.103 --> 15:04.404
INTO THE STAIRWELL.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.706
GET THE CAR READY.
KEEP THE ENGINE RUNNING.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.943
NO. THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
DON'T DO THIS.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.678
AAH!
[crashing sound,
glass shattering]

15:11.711 --> 15:13.947
(Dwight)
MY HIP BONE!

15:13.981 --> 15:15.348
(Michael)
WE'RE WEDGED BETWEEN
THE COPIER AND THE RAILING.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.649
OW! GOD!

15:16.683 --> 15:18.018
OW, MY LEG!

15:18.051 --> 15:19.719
LEAVE US, JIM!
DON'T LEAVE US!

15:19.752 --> 15:21.421
(Michael)
SAVE YOURSELF!

15:21.454 --> 15:23.156
(Dwight)
DON'T LEAVE US, HELP US!
WE NEED HELP, JIM!

15:23.190 --> 15:25.092
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
STOP USING MY NAME.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.259
AND SECOND OF ALL--

15:26.293 --> 15:27.727
(Michael)
DWIGHT, YOU GOTTA MOVE--

15:27.760 --> 15:28.661
DAMN IT, GUYS!

15:28.695 --> 15:30.397
DWIGHT, JUST MOVE OVER
A LITTLE BIT!

15:30.430 --> 15:32.265
(Dwight)
I'M LOSING CONTROL
OF MY BLADDER!

15:32.299 --> 15:33.733
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
KAREN IS BACK.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.035
(Dwight)
DID YOU SAY KAREN?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.470
(Michael)
TAKE HER TO A MOTEL.
MAKE LOVE TO HER, JIM.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.671
NO, I'M NOT DOING THAT.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.641
(Michael)
JUST SAY YOU WANNA
GET BACK TOGETHER.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.310
NO! I'M NOT DOING THAT.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.045
(Dwight)
JIM, IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO MEAN ANYTHING.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.646
DO IT FOR STANLEY.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.083
JUST CLIMB ON TOP OF HER
AND THINK ABOUT STANLEY.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.385
JIM, THIS IS IT FOR ME.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.221
PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.023
HOST THE DUNDIES.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.524
[knocking]
JIM?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.096
HEY, KAREN.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.067
UH...WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.535
FIRST OF ALL, HI.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.037
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:10.070 --> 16:10.870
YOU GOOD?

16:12.739 --> 16:15.042
I'M JUST CHECKING
ON THE OTHER BRANCHES.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.045
MICHAEL WANTS ME TO DO THAT
FROM TIME TO TIME, SO...

16:18.078 --> 16:21.581
(Dwight)
DO NOT TELL KAREN ABOUT
THE INDUSTRIAL COPIER!

16:21.614 --> 16:23.550
COPY THAT.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.552
I CRIED FOR WEEKS
OVER THAT GUY.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.054
SO, YEAH...

16:27.087 --> 16:28.755
SEEING HIM CLIMB OUT OF
A PT CRUISER

16:28.788 --> 16:31.191
IN A LADIES' WAREHOUSE
UNIFORM...

16:31.224 --> 16:32.759
FELT PRETTY GOOD.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.128
LET ME ASK YOU,

16:35.162 --> 16:36.629
DID YOU ACCOMPLISH
WHAT YOU WANTED?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.531
LISTEN, LADY,

16:38.565 --> 16:40.233
YOU CAN EXPECT THESE KIND
OF REPERCUSSIONS

16:40.267 --> 16:42.502
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP TRYING
TO POACH OUR PEOPLE.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.337
I'M TAKING STANLEY.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.374
THEN WE WILL BURN UTICA
TO THE GROUND.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.475
[whispers]
DWIGHT.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.277
[Michael clears throat]

16:50.310 --> 16:54.414
GRANTED, MAYBE THIS
WAS NOT THE BEST IDEA,

16:54.447 --> 16:58.285
BUT AT LEAST WE CARE ENOUGH
ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES

16:58.318 --> 17:02.089
THAT WE ARE WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR THEM.

17:02.122 --> 17:06.826
AND IF YOU SO MUCH AS HARM
A HAIR ON STANLEY'S HEAD...

17:06.859 --> 17:10.063
WE WILL BURN UTICA
TO THE GROUND.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.771
JIM, HANG ON A SECOND?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.173
YES.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.312
SO YOU'RE STILL

17:25.345 --> 17:27.247
DOING THIS KINDA STUFF,
HUH?

17:27.280 --> 17:30.117
YEAH.
TRYING TO QUIT, THOUGH.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.618
IF YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME,

17:31.651 --> 17:34.087
YOU COULD HAVE JUST
CALLED ME LIKE AN ADULT.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.256
OH, NO. I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.725
NOT THAT I'M NOT
HAPPY TO BE SEEING YOU.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.393
RIGHT NOW.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.695
I'M JUST SAYING, ULTIMATELY,
I WAS HERE FOR THE COPIER.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.397
EQUAL.
I'D SAY IT WAS EQUAL.

17:44.431 --> 17:48.401
SO, GOOD TO SEE YOU...

17:48.435 --> 17:49.269
[scoffs]

17:49.302 --> 17:50.270
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THAT--

17:50.303 --> 17:51.504
[clears throat]

17:51.538 --> 17:54.174
YOU KNOW, PAM AND I
ARE STILL DATING, SO...

17:54.207 --> 17:57.577
AND...I JUST MEAN THAT THINGS
ARE GOING REALLY WELL,

17:57.610 --> 18:01.348
SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU...

18:01.381 --> 18:02.282
OH, THINGS ARE GOING
REALLY WELL?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.151
ARE THEY?
MM.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.318
THEY ARE.
THAT'S GREAT.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.386
THAT'S SO GREAT.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.422
I WANNA HEAR MORE ABOUT
HOW HAPPY YOU ARE WITH PAM.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.158
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THAT?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.260
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TO UTICA

18:13.293 --> 18:14.494
AND BREAKING MY COPIER

18:14.527 --> 18:17.730
AND TELLING ME HOW WELL THINGS
ARE GOING IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.199
REALLY. THANK YOU.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.433
ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE WELCOME.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.335
I'M GOING TO GO

18:22.369 --> 18:24.771
BECAUSE OF, UM...
TRAFFIC.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.306
TRAFFIC. YEAH.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.408
OH, DEF--GO--

18:28.441 --> 18:29.442
GO 'CAUSE OF TRAFFIC.
DEFINITELY.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.778
BEAT--BEAT THE TRAFFIC.
MM-HMM.

18:31.811 --> 18:35.182
I...WILL...

18:38.485 --> 18:39.452
[clears throat]

18:39.486 --> 18:42.689
WE TRIED,
AND WE FAILED.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.593
STANLEY,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.528
YOU MAY GO.

18:48.561 --> 18:54.501
HERE IS A BOX...

18:54.534 --> 18:56.503
FOR YOUR THINGS.

18:57.704 --> 19:01.241
BUT I DOUBT THAT THAT BOX
WILL BE ABLE TO CONTAIN

19:01.274 --> 19:03.876
ALL THE MEMORIES
THAT YOU HAVE OF THIS PLACE.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.546
[sighs]

19:06.579 --> 19:07.814
FLY AWAY,
SWEET LITTLE BIRD.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.916
FLY AWAY AND BE FREE.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.386
PAM...

19:13.420 --> 19:15.922
I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP
WRITING A WANT AD.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.627
UM...

19:20.660 --> 19:22.462
WANTED...

19:22.495 --> 19:25.532
MIDDLE-AGED BLACK MAN
WITH SASS.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.501
BIG BUTT.
BIGGER HEART.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.902
[knock on door]

19:29.936 --> 19:31.571
I CAN'T...DO THIS.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.406
MICHAEL?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.242
A WORD.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.376
OF COURSE.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.214
I CHANGED MY MIND.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.550
I WANNA KEEP THIS JOB.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.285
REALLY?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.587
I WASN'T REALLY
PLANNING ON LEAVING.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.556
ALL I WANTED WAS A RAISE.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.392
HOW ON EARTH DID MICHAEL
CALL MY BLUFF?

19:52.425 --> 19:54.961
IS HE SOME SORT OF
SECRET GENIUS?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.596
[laughing]

19:56.629 --> 20:00.933
SOMETIMES I SAY
CRAZY THINGS.

20:03.936 --> 20:04.937
HEY.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.573
I'M SO SORRY.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.375
ROLANDO TOLD ME
EVERYTHING.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.944
HOW HUMILIATING.

20:11.978 --> 20:15.915
WOULD IT HELP YOU
TO RETURN TO ANOTHER AGE?

20:15.948 --> 20:19.252
A TIME OF...REFINEMENT

20:19.286 --> 20:20.920
AND CIVILITY?

20:20.953 --> 20:24.023
ARE YOU INVITING ME
TO THE FINER THINGS CLUB?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.558
(Andy)
OH--

20:25.592 --> 20:27.294
OH, COME ON!

20:30.697 --> 20:31.898
[Irish accent]
ANGELA'S ASHES.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.300
TOP O' THE MORNIN' TO IT.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.034
FRANKIE'S PROSE IS FINER
THAN A POT OF GOLD,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.469
SAY I.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.806
OKAY. DID YOU GET IT
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.308
YEP.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.909
NO, I MEAN
I REALLY LIKED IT.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.477
THOUGHT IT WAS A FUN READ.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.878
FUN?
MM-HMM.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.314
REALLY?
YEAH.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.015
WHAT WAS FUN ABOUT IT
FOR YOU?

20:49.048 --> 20:50.850
WAS IT THE DEATH
OF THE TWINS?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.288
NO, THAT WASN'T...FUN.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.956
DID YOU EVEN
READ IT?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.625
COURSE I READ IT.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.726
(Oscar)
HOW DOES IT END?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.828
WHO WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER?

21:01.861 --> 21:04.731
ANGELA.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.898
NOPE.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.634
ASHES.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.338
[mouths word] "SORRY"
