WEBVTT

00:38.121 --> 00:41.989
Little car takes first...
And third place!

00:48.966 --> 00:53.130
A lot of herbie fans
here today wearing herbie's colors.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.392
- What the heck happened to you?
- I'm sorry, crazy Dave.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.025
I had a few problems getting
this critter on the truck.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.691
Please. I've blown
bigger things out my nose.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.238
Prettier too.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.576
What was that?!

03:28.667 --> 03:31.454
I wouldn't insult him
if I was you. He's sensitive.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.123
- He's a carr.
- Yeah, I know.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.751
It's that he's proud.
That's all I'm saying.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.133
The shed I got him out of
was just full of these old trophies.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.385
I think he used to be a racecar

03:42.472 --> 03:44.713
a racecar?

03:44.808 --> 03:49.677
Yeah. You know, I bet it took
first place at the ugly-anapolis 500.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.481
Oh! Oh! Oh, ow! What did?

03:56.194 --> 03:59.152
It wasn't the car! All right.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.904
Just be calm.
I don't have to take this.

04:01.992 --> 04:06.326
This is just a carr...
An inanimate object.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.954
Oh...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.581
Are you kidding?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.624
It just leaked all over my shoe!

04:13.712 --> 04:16.202
Just get this thing
off my truck!

04:16.298 --> 04:20.166
You are so in the crusher push!

04:35.025 --> 04:36.185
Come onl!

04:49.623 --> 04:51.534
Come onl!

04:57.380 --> 04:59.587
Ahh! Whoa!

05:01.092 --> 05:03.754
Whoa!

05:08.850 --> 05:10.806
Oh!

05:13.230 --> 05:15.812
Oh...

05:25.617 --> 05:29.201
I'm... just gonna...

05:29.329 --> 05:32.446
- I got to go!
- Hey! Hey, you...

05:47.889 --> 05:50.676
All right. Listen up, car.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.803
No one makes a fool
out of crazy Dave.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.225
No one.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.017
Consider yourself crushed!

06:11.788 --> 06:14.404
Marie Peters.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.991
Derek Parker

06:21.631 --> 06:23.963
Gregory petell.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.674
Chad Peterson.

06:28.346 --> 06:32.134
- Margaret Peyton.
- Yeah!

06:33.476 --> 06:35.182
Congratulations.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.639
I've seen some photo finishes
in my time.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.224
That was cutting it close.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.901
Ok, dad.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.944
Getting dizzy. Oxygen deprived.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.568
Your mom would be so proud.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.024
You're the first Peyton
to graduate college.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.781
One where you don't
have to keep a toolbox at the end.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.954
- Where's ray?
- Running some laps.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.162
We got a qualifying race.
He's working on some problems.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.367
Like not crashing?

07:00.462 --> 07:02.168
Mag-wheels!

07:04.090 --> 07:06.547
Check out what mom and dad
got me for graduation.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.917
Oh, great. Rub it in.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.800
4.2 \v-8, right?

07:12.849 --> 07:16.216
V-8, what? I don't know,
but it's adorable!

07:16.311 --> 07:18.723
Promise you'll look
after Maggie in New York.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.897
- We'll be roommates for 15 minutes.
- An assistant producer job at ESPN.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.895
You'll be in front of
the camera in a heartbeat.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.567
Have a great time in Paris.

07:26.655 --> 07:30.113
Bye. Be back in a month.
I'll spring you from riverside.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.784
We'll cruise to the big apple
and start our new lives. Au revoir!

07:36.665 --> 07:40.032
I promised your brother we'd
meet him at the track. We got to go.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.367
Do I even get
a graduation lunch?

07:43.713 --> 07:46.329
Well, this isn't quite
what I had in mind, but...

07:46.424 --> 07:48.380
Hey, I sprung for the churros.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.709
Dad, is Sally
still sponsoring you?

07:50.804 --> 07:54.137
One of the proud, the few.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.343
Hey, guys!

07:59.437 --> 08:01.769
- Congrats on the ESPN job!
- Thank you.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.064
I thought Maggie might swing
some free publicity over there.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.733
Only publicity team Peyton
needs is to win a race.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.279
We're turning this thing around.
I know it believe me.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.826
Aw, come on, ray.
What are you doing?

08:21.459 --> 08:23.290
Ray, what...?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.549
Ow.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.761
Ray, you were just
pushing the right front.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.765
Was that what it is?
Did you learn that in college? Thanks!

08:47.110 --> 08:50.648
- At least he loses with style.
- He's sure had enough practice.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.860
I can't believe
trip Murphy won Daytona.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.784
He's a loser. A well-paid loser.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.785
Hey, ray,
the guy's a great racer.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.789
Say what you want about him.
He has excellent focus.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.912
Focus.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.502
You drove past that tree
on purpose.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.802
- No. We're taking a shortcut.
- You were gonna chop it down.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.471
We tried to knock it down
by crashing a car into it...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.549
Oh, wait! That was you!

09:20.643 --> 09:25.262
Oh, right. I'm not the one
who crashes into walls, am I?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.639
Don't let him get to you.
The important thing

09:27.734 --> 09:31.272
is when you see that tree and this town
in your rearview mirror,

09:31.321 --> 09:34.905
you know you're on your way
to a better life. Right?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.947
- Right.
- All right.

10:02.185 --> 10:05.598
Now you, gramps, had style.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.930
He sure did.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.307
Listen.

10:11.361 --> 10:15.070
I'm sorry I didn't really pull out
all the stops for graduation.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.397
It's ok. You know,

10:17.492 --> 10:19.574
that was always
mom's department.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.529
It's been ten years.
I should have more of a clue.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.286
I didn't know the team
was doing so badly.

10:27.377 --> 10:31.586
Maggie, it's a bad streak.
We'll pull out of it.

10:31.714 --> 10:37.004
But I do think it's time we find room
for you up on that wall.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.926
That ought to do it justice.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.264
- Night, dad.
- Night, baby.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.561
Tomorrow morning, getting you
a graduation present.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.021
It's ok. I really
don't need anything.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.066
I want to. First thing,
bright and early, you and me.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.284
- You get to pick it out.
- Ok.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.369
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.046
Dad, uh, what are we doing here?

11:23.141 --> 11:24.722
Buying you a car.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.051
I appreciate the gesture,
but I'm only here a month.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.062
You don't want me chauffeuring you
around for a month.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.982
Happy graduation, magpie.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.772
Hey, Dave!

11:53.463 --> 11:55.499
Wow a stock car

12:34.087 --> 12:37.625
One lap to go. Maggie Peyton
is about to make Nascar history.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.707
She's going! She's going!

12:40.843 --> 12:42.799
She's done it! Unbelievable!

12:42.845 --> 12:47.259
She's the first female driver
to take the nextel cup! Wow!

12:47.350 --> 12:49.215
Hey, Maggie!
You find anything yet?

12:54.440 --> 12:58.183
- Not yet, dad! Still looking!
- Ok, honey.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.227
- What do you think, hon?
- Nothing calls out to me.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.443
Now, trust me.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.359
There's a certified
pre-owned champion out there

13:45.408 --> 13:46.989
waiting to be discovered.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.944
A car with the guts, the character,
the heart of a thoroughbred.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.665
Dad! It's perfect!

14:03.760 --> 14:06.422
Ok, just think,
if this horn hadn't gone off,

14:06.512 --> 14:09.299
I wouldn't have found
this Nissan!

14:13.061 --> 14:15.177
Hey, Maggie.
What about this guy?

14:15.271 --> 14:18.479
These are great. Take care
of the engine, they run forever.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.603
- Doesn't really need anything.
- It's cute.

14:21.736 --> 14:22.736
But, dad...

14:25.073 --> 14:27.860
How much for the Nissan?

14:27.950 --> 14:30.487
Good eye. Good eye.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.570
We've had a lot of interest
in that car this week. But, um...

14:35.291 --> 14:37.031
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.833
Since you are
the first customer today,

14:39.921 --> 14:42.003
I think I can cut you a deal.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.043
Hmm.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.843
I'll give you 50 for the bug.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.298
Sorry, no can do. See...

14:53.351 --> 14:57.970
I always felt there was something
special about that car.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.846
I wouldn't sell
in a million years.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.808
- Seventy-five.
- Oh, sold!

15:02.860 --> 15:04.942
I'll make out the papers.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.662
At least we know the horn works.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.309
Ok, mags. Tires are good.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.227
Gas is good. Brakes are good.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.814
Look at that. The speedometer
goes up to 200 miles an hour.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.701
Somebody's got a sense of humor

15:54.787 --> 15:57.824
all right, now. Come over
to the garage later.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.865
Have augie take a look at it.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.699
Thank you, dad.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.013
"Please take care of herbie.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.354
Whatever your problem,
he'll help you find the answer."

16:28.738 --> 16:32.447
Great.
A fortune cookie on wheels

16:34.243 --> 16:35.699
ok, let's start slow.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.829
What are you doing?! Stop!

16:51.427 --> 16:53.167
This isn't funny anymore!

16:54.555 --> 16:57.922
Come on, car!
You're a car! I drivel

16:59.560 --> 17:01.642
what is going on?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.518
Oh, my god! No!

17:15.284 --> 17:17.400
- Oh, god...
- Oh, my god.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.031
I'm so sorry. Let me help you.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.657
Are you ok?

17:29.966 --> 17:33.174
- Maggie?
- Kevin?

17:34.178 --> 17:36.339
God, you look great.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.385
I mean, it's great to see you.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.843
What are you... I haven't
seen you since high school.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.645
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I just got this car.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.519
My dad wanted to get me
something for graduation.

17:52.989 --> 17:57.358
Didn't you used to drive cars
with a little bit more, uh... muscle?

17:57.451 --> 18:00.534
This car is not for racing.
It's for regular driving.

18:00.621 --> 18:01.986
- For show.
- Yeah

18:04.250 --> 18:06.241
oh, man.

18:06.335 --> 18:10.374
You know what? It's not worth it.
I'm gonna take it back to crazy Dave.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.877
- Good to see you, Kevin.
- Yeah, good to see you.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.843
Hey, mags.
I could fix it for you.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.384
Oh, no, that's ok.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.557
No. That's what I do.
Kevin's custom car shop.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.177
- Nothing too fancy.
- No. Just the basics.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.514
We'll take him for a test drive,
see what we got to work with.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.772
- Sorry for almost running you over.
- Don't do that again.

18:34.989 --> 18:39.403
Whoa! Whoa

18:39.493 --> 18:42.155
ok. All right. Easy, mags.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.407
- Smooth ride.
- Sorry.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.285
Do you know where we
could get some new shocks?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.961
Uh... there's a car show
at the fairplex.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.836
We could borrow parts
from the Hernandez brothers.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.214
Yeah, I'm not really up
for that whole scene

18:59.305 --> 19:01.387
what? You used to
tear it up there.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.089
Well, I mean, that was then.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.513
Besides, this bucket of bolts
couldn't make it down there

19:06.562 --> 19:09.429
whoa!

19:15.696 --> 19:17.232
That's the Maggie I know!

19:17.323 --> 19:19.689
What are you talking about?
I'm not doing this!

19:19.742 --> 19:20.948
What'd you say?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.745
Ok, mags!

19:32.588 --> 19:34.795
Oh, my god.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.417
It has more horsepower
than I expected.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.924
Are you kidding me?
He just took off.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.300
- He?
- Herbie!

19:44.392 --> 19:46.303
Ok, the car's name is herbie?

19:46.435 --> 19:49.302
It wasn't my first choice.
Name came with the car

19:49.397 --> 19:51.683
let's strip it down,
get rid of old parts.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.607
- Maybe there's something to salvage.
- Works for me.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.852
Go easy, mags... herbie.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.150
What are you doing?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.153
- Steering wheel's jammed.
- Left

20:03.244 --> 20:05.530
I can't turn it! It's jammed!

20:05.621 --> 20:08.328
Oki

20:08.416 --> 20:10.281
ok! Easy!

20:10.376 --> 20:13.288
Great. I'm being
carjacked by my own car!

20:28.018 --> 20:31.476
Ok. Watch the people.
Easy, easy.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.183
Oh! That's the e-brake.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.772
That should be
connected to something.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.230
Oh, good.
They have valet parking.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.276
Oh, man!

20:42.867 --> 20:44.448
Sorry.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.992
What are you doing?
You didn't want to come.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.944
I didn't! It was herbie!

20:48.998 --> 20:50.613
That's funny, mags.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.949
"It was herbie"

20:55.379 --> 20:57.620
- hey. Where are you going?
- What?

20:57.673 --> 21:01.086
- I'm so sorry.
- Her bad.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.168
Step away from the vehicle.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.300
Maggie!

21:04.388 --> 21:06.470
- What's up?
- What's up? How are you?

21:08.851 --> 21:11.308
Pablo, pancho.
Hey, what's up, guys?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.594
- Hey!
- Hello!

21:13.689 --> 21:16.601
- You look good!
- Yeah, what happened?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.978
Thanks, guys.
Great to see you too.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.609
Hey, is that your car?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.903
No no.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.572
No, no. I don't know
whose that is.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.775
Good thing,
'cause that thing is ugly!

21:41.383 --> 21:42.998
Hey, trip!

21:46.472 --> 21:48.463
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:48.557 --> 21:52.675
nextel cup series champion,
trip Murphy!

21:55.856 --> 21:58.268
I hope you don't mind
I crashed your party.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.064
When I'm in the
middle of a race,

22:03.197 --> 22:07.281
swapping paint with
Dale earnhardt, Jr. and Jeff Gordon,

22:07.409 --> 22:08.899
you know what keeps me going?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.276
It's you guys.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.869
My fans.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.950
And now, I'm going to give you
that same experience

22:18.045 --> 22:20.252
in your very own living rooms.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.872
Crash? What have you got for me?

22:22.967 --> 22:26.255
Oh, wow. You guys
are in for a real treat.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.885
It's my new video game.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.015
"Trip Murphy: Undefeated."

22:40.150 --> 22:41.856
All right.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.435
You got a sports illustrated
shoot in an hour.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.735
No sweat. I'll do two laps.
Keep the sharpies handy.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.741
And when women give you
their numbers, get photos.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.868
I don't want
a replay of Phoenix.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.367
- I do enough charity work already.
- Ok.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.072
Can I get your autograph?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.542
Trip! Sign my head.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.837
Yeah yeah!

23:03.924 --> 23:05.084
Whoo-hoo!

23:05.175 --> 23:07.962
Yes! Trip Murphy signed my head!

23:11.682 --> 23:14.173
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.892
I'm not gonna be
embarrassed again.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.477
What about the car?

23:18.564 --> 23:21.351
Crazy Dave can keep his cash.
I'll stick with my board.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.603
You can't just leave it here.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.268
Hello? Look around.
Somebody will take it.

23:46.216 --> 23:49.458
What is with this car?
Like it's trying to embarrass me...

24:03.692 --> 24:05.023
I ook at this.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.897
Some guy named Maxx
left these in the trunk

24:07.988 --> 24:09.444
you look great.

24:09.531 --> 24:14.070
You got a tiny little spot
on your shirt. What happened?

24:14.161 --> 24:17.779
- You're gonna change into those?
- Stand guard. No peeking.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.081
Don't flatter yourself.
"No peeking."

24:38.018 --> 24:39.508
Oh. Hey.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.678
- Oh, good. It fits. All zipped up.
- Let's go.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.435
- Wait. Where are the keys?
- Uh, they're in the...

24:45.567 --> 24:47.228
Oh!

24:51.156 --> 24:54.239
Oh, whoa. Take it easy, guy.
All you gotta do is ask.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.236
I'd wear a helmet too
if my ride looked like that.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.457
Oops.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.958
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Good idea, loser.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.962
Get this car back to the circus
before bozo puts out an apb.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.970
Ha-ha. Good stuff.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.734
Oh, my god!

25:31.780 --> 25:34.567
Ok. Ok, oki

25:34.616 --> 25:36.948
what are you...? Take it easy.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.112
Oh...

25:42.791 --> 25:44.998
Oh!

25:47.796 --> 25:50.629
Ohhh! Oh, dude!

25:53.135 --> 25:56.753
- What did you do?
- I swear to god, I did not do that!

25:56.805 --> 25:58.796
Ok, try telling that to him.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.801
Race! Racel race! Racel

26:03.896 --> 26:05.511
trip! You gonna take that?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.103
Race, race, race!

26:07.232 --> 26:10.065
I can't race. Get out there
and tell them I'm sorry!

26:10.152 --> 26:12.143
I love that I have
to do this. Sure.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.229
'Cause trip and I
have such a good rapport.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.485
Racel racel racel

26:17.576 --> 26:21.285
what have I got to lose?
It's a bug.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.291
Open.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.954
Oh, my god! Kevin!
Kevin! Help me!

26:32.591 --> 26:34.627
Kevin! Kevin!

26:35.719 --> 26:38.085
Mags! What are you doing?

26:38.180 --> 26:40.637
Kevin!

26:51.360 --> 26:53.851
What is going on?
I don't want to race!

26:56.990 --> 26:58.696
Kevin! Kevin!

27:02.955 --> 27:04.866
Race, race, race, race!

27:15.175 --> 27:17.791
What are you trying to do,
you crazy little car?

27:49.918 --> 27:52.000
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

28:25.370 --> 28:28.237
Ok. So that's
how you want to do it?

30:08.348 --> 30:10.839
I thought you said
you hadn't been racing.

30:10.934 --> 30:14.222
- That was unbelievable!
- I know. Unbelievable.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.723
Hey, trip. What do you say?

30:18.025 --> 30:19.811
Get that camera out of my face!

30:20.861 --> 30:23.022
Did you see me
come off that guardrail?

30:23.071 --> 30:25.278
I saw... I don't know
how you did that.

30:25.407 --> 30:28.774
All right. This is gonna
sound strange, but it wasn't me.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.446
I think it was herbie.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.036
Herbie is a car.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.322
You always said
they had personalities.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.284
Yeah, personalities.
They're not possessed.

30:38.378 --> 30:42.747
I can't explain it, but when trip
blocked me on that final turn,

30:42.799 --> 30:45.962
I wished I was on my skateboard
so I could rail-slide past.

30:46.053 --> 30:49.045
Then herbie did it.
It was like we were connected.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.385
That makes perfect sense.
Cuckoo!

30:52.434 --> 30:54.049
What are you doing?

30:54.102 --> 30:58.095
Checking to make sure exhaust fumes
haven't gone back inside the car.

30:58.190 --> 31:02.103
Kevin, I beat the reigning
Nascar champion in a '63 bug!

31:02.235 --> 31:04.521
- How else do you explain that?
- How about,

31:04.613 --> 31:06.854
you're an amazing racer
and proved it?

31:06.948 --> 31:09.030
Why are you
afraid to admit that?

31:09.117 --> 31:14.783
You beat trip Murphy, on your own,
with this... hunk of junk.

31:14.915 --> 31:15.915
Ow!

31:19.544 --> 31:21.705
Hey. Admit it.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.083
It felt great to be
behind the wheel again.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.082
Yeah it did

31:27.135 --> 31:28.796
that's what I thought.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.935
The family's been
in racing for 40 years.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.349
I won't let guys in suits
tell me what to do.

31:44.444 --> 31:47.777
- These guys pay our bills.
- What do they know about racing?

31:47.823 --> 31:49.814
They know not to back
a losing team!

31:54.371 --> 31:57.579
- Another sponsor bite the dust?
- They come, they go.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.952
That's business.
You got in late last night.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.834
Let me direct you to the date
of birth on my license.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.495
Let me direct you to the
address on that license.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.705
My house, my rules.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.276
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Sally.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.150
Hey, sal. Don't tell me
you're pulling out too.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.236
No. I'm making your day.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.988
You're gonna love this.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.329
Taking the sports world
by storm.

32:39.416 --> 32:42.579
Here it is again.
Our exclusive footage of trip Murphy

32:42.711 --> 32:46.499
just getting scorched
in an impromptu street race.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.084
And get this:

32:48.216 --> 32:52.334
The competition was
a 1963 Volkswagen beetle.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.845
That's right, folks. A '63 bug.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.810
I'l be back dad!

33:02.898 --> 33:04.889
What did I do?

33:16.411 --> 33:18.823
I sense you're looking
for an explanation.

33:18.914 --> 33:22.281
You promised,
no more street racing.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.208
Listen to me.
I almost lost you once.

33:25.253 --> 33:29.587
- I'm not gonna let that happen again.
- At least let me explain first.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.505
Ok, go ahead. I'm all ears.

33:31.593 --> 33:32.958
I ran into Kevin.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.795
Kevin? You aren't
in town 24 hours,

33:35.889 --> 33:39.381
and goofy Kevin talks you
into street racing again.

33:39.476 --> 33:42.092
Maggie. Do you think
I busted my butt

33:42.187 --> 33:43.893
to put you through school

33:43.939 --> 33:46.601
so you could get back behind
the wheel of a racecar?

33:50.237 --> 33:53.604
- Dad, I wasn't even driving.
- Who was?

33:53.657 --> 33:57.741
It was Kevin's friend, Maxx,
who was driving.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.152
They wanted to challenge trip,

34:00.247 --> 34:04.365
so I let them borrow the car,
and it was a one-shot deal

34:08.672 --> 34:09.911
promise?

34:10.966 --> 34:13.378
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.012
Sorry.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.011
I'm sorry too.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.360
Whoever this Maxx guy is,
must be pretty good

34:34.447 --> 34:37.234
if he beat trip Murphy
in a little thing like that.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.860
Not bad

35:07.606 --> 35:11.019
Life's a trip. Then you drive.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.058
- Cut.
- I nailed that one.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.189
I agree. I'd love
to try one more.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.647
- It doesn't get much better than that.
- Ok. Moving on!

35:18.700 --> 35:20.656
- Can I talk to you?
- What is it?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.325
The sponsors are all over me,

35:22.412 --> 35:24.494
and the ESPN special
is down the drain

35:24.539 --> 35:27.076
because you banished
the film crew

35:27.167 --> 35:31.536
- I won't talk about yesterday.
- I'm not. I'm talking about tomorrow.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.121
This is your future.
Those people paid for it,

35:34.215 --> 35:37.707
- so get your head in the game...
- I can't deal with this, Larry!

35:42.724 --> 35:45.716
Good hustle, everybody.
Good hustle.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.698
It doesn't make any sense.
How could that thing beat me?

36:05.830 --> 36:08.242
Nobody cares about
a stupid street race.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.621
I care. I'm a nextel cup
series champion

36:11.711 --> 36:14.168
who got beat
by a Volkswagen bug.

36:14.255 --> 36:17.918
Yes. You're a champion
on the track, where it counts.

36:21.429 --> 36:24.421
By Thursday, everybody
will forget it happened.

36:24.474 --> 36:27.716
I've been up all night
going over this race.

36:27.811 --> 36:30.268
I outclassed him on every front.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.444
- I want a rematch.
- Aw, jeez. Trip, no.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.442
It's me, your brother.
Forget it.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.616
A two-day racing event
where I beat all comers

36:44.703 --> 36:47.365
and then destroy
that little bug.

36:47.455 --> 36:51.448
I want posters at every garage,
body shop and auto parts store,

36:51.543 --> 36:54.000
and full-page ads
in the local rags.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.453
How do you know
this Maxx guy would show up?

36:56.548 --> 36:59.665
Maxx is a racer he'll show.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.181
I'm gonna exterminate this bug.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.979
Hey.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.534
Where you been? Look at this.
I want to show you something. Huh?

37:28.496 --> 37:30.828
2180 engine.
Dual weber carburetors.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.581
Front, rear swing axles.
Pretty sweet, huh?

37:33.668 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, they're, um... wow.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.749
You really put
a lot of thought into this.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.424
There's potential in this car.
We can turn him into a champion.

37:42.510 --> 37:46.970
It'll take work, but, uh, there's
a race in Lancaster in a few weeks

37:47.056 --> 37:50.514
whoa. Hold on a second.
The other day was great.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.635
I don't know how it happened,
but it was a fluke.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.974
You loved being
back behind the wheel

37:56.024 --> 37:58.436
yeah, I did, but now
I'm moving to New York

37:58.526 --> 38:00.642
and I'm starting a new life and...

38:00.695 --> 38:02.560
How are you gonna
move to New York,

38:02.655 --> 38:04.816
a city where you take
a subway to work?

38:04.908 --> 38:07.024
Listen, I told my dad
no more racing,

38:07.118 --> 38:08.733
and I ended up lying to him.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.820
The last time that happened,
I ended up in the hospital.

38:11.915 --> 38:15.703
Note the vicious afterschool special
cycle I'm trying to break here.

38:15.794 --> 38:19.412
- I need cash for my apartment.
- Those are the classifieds.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.503
Listen, kev, I'm really sorry.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.090
I know, I know.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.135
What about herbie?

38:31.226 --> 38:34.639
I guess I'll drop off the keys
and the number to an exorcist.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.766
What?

38:41.861 --> 38:44.227
Maggie, what happened?
Are you all right?

38:52.997 --> 38:55.329
I know what you're thinking.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.372
It's one race, mags.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.167
One race, ten grand.
That's a lot of cash.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.961
Ok. We'll split it.

39:02.090 --> 39:06.299
You got rent money to pay.
I got this dump to fix up.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.798
Everybody wins. What do you say?

39:09.681 --> 39:10.921
Maxx?

39:34.455 --> 39:35.661
Come on, herbie.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.502
Hey!

39:52.223 --> 39:53.804
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.166
Yeah!

41:18.226 --> 41:22.686
I have been over every inch
of this model ten times.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.056
I've run all the tests.

41:26.150 --> 41:30.063
There's no way an ordinary vw engine
like this could have smoked yours.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.239
There's nothing ordinary
about this bug.

41:41.249 --> 41:43.991
I don't know what
it's got under its hood,

41:44.085 --> 41:46.701
but I intend to find out.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.925
Those guys always use you

42:02.061 --> 42:03.767
to get me to do something.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.899
You can't let them drop us.
It'll break Ray's heart.

42:09.986 --> 42:12.568
No. It's gonna break your heart.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.524
When are you gonna
open your eyes?

42:14.615 --> 42:17.072
Ray junior
is not cut out for racing.

42:17.160 --> 42:20.368
I have held out
as long as I can.

42:20.455 --> 42:23.993
Bass pro is dropping you.
I'm sorry.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.412
Wait a minute, Sally.
Wait, please.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.167
Tell them to hold on
until the speedway races.

42:36.304 --> 42:40.422
If ray doesn't place,
I'm out. I close up shop.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.132
I'll sell motor oil.
I'll do something.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.893
How long you been standing here?

42:54.947 --> 42:56.437
Long enough.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.446
I sure am glad
you're not part of this.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.197
Why do I feel like we just got
sentenced to five to ten?

43:44.288 --> 43:46.279
I'm gonna go sign us in.

43:54.715 --> 43:56.831
Maggie Peyton.

43:56.884 --> 43:59.421
Haven't seen you in a long time.
Who you here for?

43:59.512 --> 44:02.754
- "In-the-way ray"?
- Actually, I'm sponsoring Maxx.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.636
So, do you like the makeover?

44:18.239 --> 44:20.855
You can take the car
out of the junkyard, Maggie,

44:20.950 --> 44:23.908
but you can't take
the junkyard out of the car.

44:23.953 --> 44:27.286
- How do you know this Maxx?
- Um, we go way back.

44:27.373 --> 44:31.366
I'd like to meet him.
Can you arrange a face-to-face?

44:31.419 --> 44:33.535
He's meditating.
Getting in the zone.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.961
Sure. Pressure's getting to him?

44:36.048 --> 44:39.540
- He's not worried. He beat you once.
- Beginner's luck.

44:39.635 --> 44:43.127
You tell that to yourself at night
in your trip Murphy pajamas?

44:43.222 --> 44:44.587
Look,

44:44.640 --> 44:49.100
you tell Maxx I'm really
looking forward to the rematch.

44:49.145 --> 44:52.387
Oh, hey. Sorry, big fella.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.523
I'm so sick of all
this trip Murphy cra...

44:55.610 --> 44:56.975
Geez.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.315
Hey. See you later, trip.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.273
I don't know if I can do this.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.700
Time to suit up, Maxx.

45:09.457 --> 45:13.370
Race fans,
please welcome our own trip Murphy.

45:18.591 --> 45:21.458
We've got 200 names up there.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.589
By the end of the day,
there will be only one.

45:24.722 --> 45:29.091
- Yeah!
- And that driver will face me,

45:29.143 --> 45:31.805
and have a chance
to win $10,000.

45:33.105 --> 45:34.436
I et's race.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.182
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:37.276 --> 45:40.518
today's winner goes up
against trip Murphy tomorrow!

45:54.877 --> 45:56.117
Herbiel

46:02.677 --> 46:05.168
Vroom, vroom!
Let me hear you say "hey, yo!"

46:05.263 --> 46:07.720
What a day.
The real wild card here

46:07.807 --> 46:10.469
is the enigmatic racer
known only as Maxx.

46:10.518 --> 46:12.304
Questions abound. Who is Maxx?

46:12.395 --> 46:15.011
Where did he come from?
What's with the helmet?

46:44.468 --> 46:46.333
Gotcha, Maxx.

46:59.483 --> 47:02.145
I've signed so many autographs,
my hand is numb.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.397
Guess who wants an interview.

48:21.524 --> 48:24.106
How'd you get over here?

48:24.193 --> 48:25.308
What's wrong?

48:26.695 --> 48:30.813
Wow. Maggie, you...
Look amazing.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.241
I mean, you know, for someone
who changed in a port-a-potty.

48:34.328 --> 48:37.445
Come on. I know there's
a compliment in there somewhere.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.614
I think I'm losing my mind.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.494
That was my first reaction.

48:41.627 --> 48:45.290
And then I embraced
the mystery that is herbie.

48:45.381 --> 48:46.746
She's too young for you.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.047
I got to tell you...

48:53.139 --> 48:55.050
Winning definitely suits you.

48:56.517 --> 48:59.054
Oh, I got you something.

49:01.564 --> 49:02.724
It's stupid.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.562
It's for luck tomorrow.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.644
It's amazing.

49:17.872 --> 49:19.282
Evening.

49:19.373 --> 49:22.536
I hardly recognized you
without your camera crew.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.333
I decided to give them
the night off.

49:27.381 --> 49:28.837
Can we talk?

49:30.050 --> 49:31.050
Alone?

49:33.220 --> 49:35.302
- You ok?
- Yeah

49:37.600 --> 49:40.342
your driver did pretty well,
for an amateur.

49:40.394 --> 49:45.309
But he's got some serious flaws.
Take his car, for instance.

49:45.399 --> 49:47.481
The chassis's too high, and...

49:47.568 --> 49:50.275
The aerodynamics are all wrong.

49:50.404 --> 49:53.692
Thanks for the tip.
I'll pass it on to Maxx.

49:53.782 --> 49:56.273
You know what I
can't figure out?

49:56.410 --> 49:58.696
Why you're not behind the wheel

49:58.787 --> 50:01.870
I hear you were a heck of
a street racer back in the day.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.453
- Ancient history.
- I doubt it.

50:04.543 --> 50:05.828
It's in your blood.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.707
Your grandfather was one
of the greatest drivers

50:08.756 --> 50:10.246
to ever hit the track.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.956
He's why I got into racing.

50:12.051 --> 50:17.421
And I gotta believe it's
hard-wired into your DNA.

50:17.556 --> 50:21.219
Your dad ought to get ray out of 56
and put you behind the wheel.

50:21.352 --> 50:24.765
How many women drivers
have won a Nascar championship?

50:24.813 --> 50:28.601
Well... it only takes
one person to Blaze a trail.

50:30.319 --> 50:33.106
Ever think that you might be
the next great Peyton?

50:35.282 --> 50:38.365
Thanks for the props,
but I gotta go.

50:38.452 --> 50:41.569
You want to see how it feels
behind the wheel of a real car?

50:47.378 --> 50:48.788
Are you serious?

50:48.879 --> 50:51.586
I doubt your old man is
gonna make you the same offer.

50:52.883 --> 50:53.963
Go on.

50:54.093 --> 50:56.084
It'll be our little secret.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.592
Ok, bug.

52:20.679 --> 52:23.170
Let's see what makes you tick.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.191
There's no way you could
beat me with this engine.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.857
Ooh!

52:54.129 --> 52:56.085
You want a piece of me?!

53:09.978 --> 53:11.309
Who's laughing now?

53:29.957 --> 53:31.367
Huh?

53:47.683 --> 53:51.141
- That was unbelievable!
- She's a pretty sweet ride.

53:51.186 --> 53:53.222
I've never driven
anything like it.

53:53.313 --> 53:56.055
That was my most awesome
driving experience.

53:56.150 --> 53:58.937
Amazing what
a real car can do, isn't it?

53:58.986 --> 54:02.353
I got a little proposition.
Why don't we raise the stakes.

54:02.448 --> 54:03.984
My car for your car.

54:04.074 --> 54:07.612
Let's make tomorrow's race
for pinks too. Huh?

54:07.661 --> 54:10.744
I don't know. I mean,
herbie's really special.

54:10.831 --> 54:14.540
Come on. Nobody's gonna
take you seriously in that thing.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.077
Now, if, uh,

54:18.172 --> 54:21.084
you drive home
in trip Murphy's stock car,

54:21.175 --> 54:24.793
your dad would be an idiot
not to put you on the team.

54:24.887 --> 54:27.629
What do you say? For pinks?

54:32.060 --> 54:33.220
All right.

54:40.068 --> 54:43.652
You just better hope your boy Maxx
is on top of his game tomorrow.

54:52.748 --> 54:56.332
Ray, if you drank all the
orange juice, I'll kill you.

54:56.376 --> 54:59.914
- Mag-wheels!
- Charisma!

55:00.005 --> 55:03.168
- Why aren't you in France?
- Ugh! Paris was a drag.

55:03.217 --> 55:05.708
I couldn't understand anybody.
And hello!

55:05.803 --> 55:08.215
Learn to pick up
after our poodles.

55:08.263 --> 55:11.255
I thought I'd come back to start
our road trip early.

55:11.350 --> 55:14.763
Slight problem. I promised
I'd meet a friend in the desert.

55:14.853 --> 55:17.720
Why? Are you burying a body?

55:18.816 --> 55:21.102
No, he's in a racing tournament.

55:21.235 --> 55:24.853
You think you're clever,
but I see through you.

55:24.947 --> 55:25.982
You can?

55:26.073 --> 55:28.189
It's obvious. You're dating him.

55:29.368 --> 55:30.858
Ok, if you say so.

55:30.953 --> 55:33.911
Don't be coy. What's his name?
Is it serious?

55:33.956 --> 55:38.541
Maxx. You know, we're so close,
it's like we're the same person.

55:38.627 --> 55:41.209
What are you doing?
Where have you been?

55:41.296 --> 55:45.039
In a nightmare where my dad,
brother and best friend showed up.

55:45.133 --> 55:48.125
Well, you got a new problem.
Herbie's freaking out.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.677
I don't know what to do.
Stop it!

55:53.767 --> 55:55.883
Did you leave him alone
with trip?

55:55.978 --> 55:58.344
Hey, Maggie!

56:00.107 --> 56:02.473
- Who's that?
- Keep her away from my dad.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.433
And she thinks I'm dating Maxx.

56:04.528 --> 56:07.144
Just don't ask me to explain.

56:07.239 --> 56:09.605
Five-minute warning.
Get suited up.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.487
And have a heart-to-heart
with your car. Ok?

56:12.578 --> 56:13.818
Yeah. Sure.

56:14.913 --> 56:17.245
- Where you been?
- Excuse me.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.657
I'm Kevin!
You must be charisma, yes?

56:19.751 --> 56:21.958
- Good to meet you.
- I just came back.

56:22.045 --> 56:26.004
- I had the worst time...
- Herbie. What's going on?

56:26.091 --> 56:29.299
I don't have time for this now.
We need to beat trip.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.386
Just get a grip. You're a car.

56:33.473 --> 56:35.759
You do what I tell you to do,
all right?

56:45.485 --> 56:47.225
Bool

56:47.321 --> 56:49.437
it's winner take all at the

56:49.531 --> 56:51.487
trip Murphy
sudden death showdown.

56:51.575 --> 56:54.191
Maxx decimated
his challengers yesterday,

56:54.286 --> 56:57.278
but now he's up against
superstar trip Murphy!

56:57.331 --> 57:02.997
And now here comes Maxx
and herbie to the starting line.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.715
Blow his wheels off, Maggie!

57:18.810 --> 57:20.175
I mean, maxxie!

57:51.385 --> 57:53.626
Come on, herbie!
He's pulling ahead!

57:57.557 --> 57:58.842
That's it, herbie.

58:15.075 --> 58:16.940
Come on! I want that stock car!

58:28.088 --> 58:29.168
What?

58:29.256 --> 58:30.371
Oh!

58:46.398 --> 58:48.514
Stupid car!
You blew this on purpose!

58:48.608 --> 58:50.348
You were supposed to help me!

58:50.444 --> 58:54.062
The voice is more high-pitched
than I might have imagined.

58:55.115 --> 58:56.946
Come on, Maxx.

58:57.034 --> 59:00.242
Take off the helmet and show
everybody who you really are.

59:10.964 --> 59:14.798
- It's a chick!
- That ain't a chick! That's Maggie!

59:16.636 --> 59:18.877
I guess I was wrong about you.

59:18.972 --> 59:21.384
You're not the next
great Peyton after all.

59:21.475 --> 59:24.933
You're just another amateur
who choked in the clutch.

59:32.652 --> 59:38.147
Mags! Maggie. Hey. Hey, come on.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.276
Come on. Stop this.

59:39.367 --> 59:41.198
You had a bad day.
That's it. Ok?

59:41.286 --> 59:45.950
Come on. Let's get out of here,
take herbie back to the garage.

59:46.083 --> 59:49.621
- There's always another race.
- There's not. Kevin, it's over.

59:49.753 --> 59:52.369
I should have never done
this in the first place.

59:52.506 --> 59:53.586
That's

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:05.641
- Hey. Whoa. Get away from him!
- Hold it, buddy! Take it easy.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:08.427
- Ok. All right! Easy!
- Wait a minute.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.229
- Maggie didn't tell you?
- What?

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:13.557
We were racing for pinks.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:17.361
It was a little deal we made
after I let her race my car.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:22.612
She said it was
the best ride of her life

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.207
Please tell me
you didn't do that.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:36.588
Look, Kevin, I'm sorry.
Ok? I'm sorry.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:39.166
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to herbie.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.175
He's the one
you stabbed in the back.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.725
- How could you lie to me?
- I can explain.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.568
Your word
used to mean something.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.941
I thought I taught you honesty.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:02.818
Guess I was wrong.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.531
- Dad, Walt!
- I'm through listening, Maggie.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:17.541
- Don't hurt him!
- It's a car!

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.342
Payback time, bug.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:49.282
I can't believe you were pulling
a racer x on everybody.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.079
I thought this was
a conversation-free ride.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.782
We've been friends for years.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.209
I've never known
the real you until today.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.411
A lying backstabber

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.962
who alienated
everyone she cares about.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.798
You don't get it.
You were awesome out there

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.134
why go to New York?

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.674
You belong behind
the wheel of a racecar

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:10.053
- grab the wheel!
- What are you doing?

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.223
Sorry.

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:14.098
Look, I'm really excited
about this new career.

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.601
Are you going to be happy
to report the story

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.641
rather than being one yourself?

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.240
Trip, we need to talk.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:32.746
Amateur hour's over.
I've got a real race to prepare for.

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:34.447
I want to buy herbie back.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.291
- Herbie?
- The Volkswagen.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.961
Oh, yeah, the bug.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:43.586
I'm sorry. I'd like to help you,
but you're a little late.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:46.510
Crash just took him out
for a little spin.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.507
Trip, what did you do with him?!

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:52.140
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:55.427
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:58.514
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:01.433
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.395
Ten cars enter! One car

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:15.910
Yeah!

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:31.968
Ten cars enter! One car leaves!

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.676
Drivers! Are you ready?

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.135
Get set!

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.471
Let's go!

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.535
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.367
- Drivers only.
- No, wait.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:59.624
You don't understand.
That's my car out there.

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.919
Well, now, you parked it
in the wrong place.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.167
My name's Jimmy d.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.093
This here's my place,

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.547
and that there car
belongs to me.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:15.177
How much to buy him back?

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:18.305
If he comes out
of this thing in one piece,

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:21.054
I'll just give him back
to you free. How's that?

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:54.922
Whoo! Monster trucks rock!

01:04:56.768 --> 01:05:00.932
I'm gonna wipe that bug
off my windshield!

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:10.987
Don't just sit there!

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.283
Do you work out?

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:19.036
Yeah, actually.
My gym's six miles from here.

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:20.284
Go, Maggie!

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.842
- What are you doing?
- Sorry!

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:43.641
Come on, herbie.
I can't lose you. We're a team!

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.194
I need you, herbie! Come on!

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:57.696
Oh, come on, herbie.
Don't do this please!

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.662
That's it. Come on, herbie.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.251
You can do it!

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.976
I didn't do that.
It was the car.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:32.481
- His name is herbie.
- That's a ridiculous na.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.284
Ok, herbie.
Let's get out of here.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.489
Yeah!

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.071
Oh, come on!

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.083
Jerk!

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.511
Go, herbie, go! Come on!

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:45.933
Yeah!

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.391
There we go!

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.987
All right! Hang on, herbie!

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.540
Pile driver!

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:33.805
Thanks, buddy.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:00.924
What? What?

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.719
Ahh!

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.019
Oh...

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.678
Look, I don't care if you
ever speak to me again,

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:13.559
but you have to help herbie.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.640
What happened?

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:18.772
I was a jerk. I know.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.734
Me too.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:25.450
- You weren't a jerk.
- No, I meant...

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:27.785
I also know you were a jerk.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:36.245
What are you gonna do about ESPN
and New York and the big time?

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.830
I met someone
who made me shift gears.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.041
You know, get a new perspective.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:49.161
We're down to the final few spots
to see who gets into the big race.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.080
We're down to the final few spots
to see who gets into the big race.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.595
One lap to go for
ray Peyton, Jr. in the 56 car.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:54.930
It's gonna be close.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:59.063
Let's see if ray Peyton, Jr. can qualify
for Sunday's nextel cup race.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:00.814
Come on, ray!

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:10.612
Whoo! Yeah!

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.335
Oh, my god.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:34.807
Peyton. To the right.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.764
- He needs to be transferred.
- Ray, you ok?

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.808
I'm fine. I keep
telling everybody.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.815
Can we please get out of here?
I'm fine! Jeez!

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.407
I guess that means
he's not totally fine.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:49.950
No.

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:52.533
- Come here, ray. Come on.
- Ow!

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.576
Doc, I'm fine.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.875
- Look straight ahead.
- I see ijt it's

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.369
now it's bright.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:01.705
There's a problem
with his left eye.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:04.131
His depth perception is off.

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:07.635
We won't know the extent
of the problem until we run tests.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.046
Bottom line,
he can't race Sunday.

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:17.895
Dad, I'm sorry.

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:22.351
Hey. It's not your fault.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:25.270
You ran great today.
I'm gonna go see the doctor.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.479
Wait a minute, dad.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.901
I still qualified.

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:30.616
All we need is another driver
and we got a shot.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.159
Let Maggie race.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.040
Yeah, ray. It's a good idea.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:45.081
I mean, team Peyton
needs this race.

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:47.462
She's ready, sir.
She's really good.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:54.470
No. That's not gonna happen.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.845
Dad!

01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:00.017
Dad, I'm sorry
I lied to you, ok?

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:03.103
But all I've ever
wanted to do is race.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:05.230
You're not getting
behind the wheel

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:08.696
because I'm a girl? I've had
one crash. Ray's had dozens!

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.356
It's different!

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:12.491
The only difference
is your support!

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.944
What's really your problem
with me racing?

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:22.702
Because you're the
spitting image of your mom.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:28.837
And I can't lose her twice.

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:33.755
Dad, I may look like her
on the outside,

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.177
ok, but on the inside, I'm you.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.759
I'm a Peyton.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.436
Racing is in my blood.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.226
Please, let me race.

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:46.560
I can't

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:49.270
I'm sorry.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.239
I got it. Ok.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.408
All right. Fine. Bye.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:10.545
I have bad news. I just got off
the phone with my supplier.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:14.512
They're not gonna give me parts
until I pay my overdue bills,

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:18.683
- which you need money to do.
- So you can't fix herbie?

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:36.404
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- Mags, I'm not blind.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:40.283
I just can't race. But you can.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.498
You're taking my space tomorrow.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:44.458
Well, wait. What about dad?

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:47.787
Dad always says
I should be a team leader

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.424
I called rest of the crew.
They agree. You're the one.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:58.130
Look, we got a lot to do

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.926
if we wanna get my car
ready to race.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.228
There's one car I'm gonna drive.
He's sitting over there.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.143
You serious?

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.268
I race in herbie,
or I don't race at all

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:12.755
I'm with trip Murphy,
nextel cup series champion.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.549
The prevailing wisdom
in the press box

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:18.878
is that your only worry is you
don't have enough shelf space

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.713
for a fourth championship.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:23.049
Tell the boys
thanks for the support.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:26.056
But it's a tough track.
It's a 500-mile race.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:28.604
There are some
competent drivers out here.

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.765
Jeff Gordon's a decent driver.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.067
There's an outside shot
he could win.

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.194
I guess what
I'm saying is, it's a...

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:38.114
Long race and anything
can happen in this sport.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.790
We love you, trip!

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:59.920
I thought you told me
you destroyed that car.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:03.806
- I'm sorry, dude.
- Hey, trip.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.508
I know you're gonna win,

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:11.059
I've set up a slim-fast
"big loser" campaign.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.435
So there's that.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.732
- He's mad at me.
- He's mad at me.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.485
- Hates me.
- He hates us both.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.534
- Never seen a bug with a spoiler.
- Don't touch

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:32.455
Soft top on a racecar.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.917
- I like that.
- I like that

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:41.427
- this car just winked at me.
- A racecar winked at you.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.800
I swear the car winked at me.

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.382
Are you feeling ok?
Is it the pressure?

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:49.014
I'm fine! Fine.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:52.138
No problem. I'm telling you,
it just winked at me.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.310
- Hey, kev.
- Hey.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:59.854
- Could we get a second alone?
- You and.?

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:02.031
- Herbie.
- Of course. Hey, guys.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:05.651
Ray? Augie? Let's give
the lady some space, huh?

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.744
- Sure.
- Thanks, guys.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:22.926
You nervous?

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:28.220
It's good to be nervous.
Keeps you alert.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:34.848
I just want to say,
in the spirit of honesty,

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.107
I did total a car once
when I was racing.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.648
That was a long time ago.

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:46.200
Hey, um...
Thanks for not giving up on me.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.285
All right.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:54.037
Ready to do this thing?

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:00.130
Cool. Let's show them
what we got.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:56.520
Here we go, herbie. This is it.

01:18:56.607 --> 01:19:00.225
- Maggie Peyton. Is that right?
- That's what I've got too.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:03.857
So it's Maggie Peyton
in ♪53 for team Peyton

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:06.314
in a last-minute ruling
by race officials.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.990
What? Come on.
You've tried to think of a way

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.818
to sell gear to women for years.

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:12.911
It says she calls
the car herbie.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.455
I've never heard
of a vw bug racing Nascar,

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:17.703
but team Peyton
found a loophole.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:19.872
- Go, Maggie!
- What are you doing?

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:22.417
You go, girl! Whoo!

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.796
Go, Maggie, go!

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:43.104
Ladies and gentlemen,
rise for our national anthem.

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.592
Here we go.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:26.185
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:30.197
Is this what you dreamed
it'd be like?

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:34.744
Yeah. I mean, I wanted my dad
here cheering me on, but...

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.913
Yeah. There's something
I want to say to you.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.707
I guess
I underestimated you guys.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.253
Good luck out there today.

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.380
Thanks, trip.

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:54.214
Word to the wise:
It gets pretty nasty out there.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:58.267
Uh, trip, we got a race.

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.845
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Don't listen to him.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:04.018
He's trying to get inside your head.
Kev, let's go.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:05.189
All right.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.895
So, you wanted
to tell me something.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:11.150
Yeah

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:14.650
I was gonna say,
don't cut your turns too tight.

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.201
Got it, chief.

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:19.078
Ok.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:27.037
Let's go!

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:50.941
Drivers, start your engines!

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:12.383
We've got
the makings of a great race today.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:15.336
Beautiful weather
and a great field of cars

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:18.298
as they head out
for their two pace laps.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.849
We anticipate a record crowd.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.801
Fans have come to see
which driver

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:24.978
will hoist
the nextel cup trophy.

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.230
Great stories bookend this field

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:29.148
trip Murphy, star of the season,

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:32.478
will lead the field to the
green flag from pole position.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:35.606
Then there's Maggie Peyton,
starting last.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:37.482
We'll see if she has what it takes

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.735
and if herbie has
a good enough engine.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:42.909
The pace car is off,
the green flag is out,

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:45.908
and we're underway here
at California speedway!

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:53.044
Those guys are fast!

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:56.298
Looks like
the 53 car got left in the dust.

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.049
There is a minimum speed.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.256
She better get going
or get a black flag.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:03.137
Come on, herbie.
We're not out of this yet.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:07.263
Come on, mags. Go!

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:10.516
Rookie jitters
or a mechanical problem,

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.143
but Maggie Peyton's
barely hanging on now.

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:14.944
Ok. Let's go get Dale!

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.993
Herbie starts to gain ground.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.947
Here's Peyton drafting up
fo Dale jarrett in the 88.

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:29.869
Wait. I don't
think herbie's drafting.

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.329
I think he's
literally attached to ♪88.

01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:34.415
That little car's
riding my bumper!

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.751
Come on, Dale, shake her off!

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:40.508
Hang on!

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.348
Come on, Maggie.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.471
Here we go! Ready?

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:50.973
What a move!

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:54.522
Maggie just did a slingshot on
Dale jarrett to move past ♪88.

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:56.444
Yes! Go, mags!

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:59.569
Unorthodox, but it
put her back in the race.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:02.363
I bet her granddad's
smiling at that one.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.538
We're back in it.
Who's running first?

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.741
Trip has junior by 2 lengths.

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.217
Come on, mags!

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:04.429
Best pit stop
of the day for team Peyton.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:06.097
That keeps them in the hunt.

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:08.425
Got a hungry pack
chasing the leaders.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.513
Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon,
Mike bliss, all after the top spot.

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:16.192
Maggie Peyton
and herbie come up on the outside.

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:19.691
Eighteen laps to go in one
of the most surprising races

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.146
in Nascar history.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:23.319
Trip Murphy in ♪82 is in front.

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.909
But can he hold the lead
in the final laps?

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:27.038
Here we come.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.662
Herbie, we gotta find
an opening!

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.291
We'll make a move on turn three.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.090
They're boxing us in.

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:47.673
Three wide behind the leaders!

01:25:47.768 --> 01:25:49.599
Labonte low,
Peyton in the middle!

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:53.019
Peyton takes a shot from Gordon
and one from labonte.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:55.188
And now one from Kasey kahne!

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.433
Herbie's getting pounded
in this pack!

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:03.359
- I'm getting killed. Can't shake them!
- Yes, you can.

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:05.611
You can do this, sparkplug.

01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:08.944
- Dad?
- Buckle down and grit your teeth.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.537
Come on, magpie.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.825
You're the next great Peyton.
Time for everyone to know it.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.251
Thanks, dad.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:21.290
L. Ook at that.

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:22.465
Now what?

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.839
- Any suggestions?
- Gas it. Gas it right now!

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:35.224
Huh?

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:38.060
There's
running over competition,

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.857
but never done like that!

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:41.560
- Yeah!
- Yah-hah!

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:44.112
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:47.900
Uh-oh. We've got a new problem.

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:51.157
Herbie's losing
oil pressure... fast!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.458
Looks like the 53's
leaking oil on the track.

01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:58.835
We're coming in.

01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:05.129
Kevin, it's Sally.
What's going on with ♪53?

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:08.299
- Did you drive here?
- Yeah. Why?

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:10.798
Here comes the caution flag.

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.974
Everyone to the pits.

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:16.770
Team Peyton may be out of
the race with that oil leak

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:39.083
That stunt you pulled
almost cost us the race!

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.328
Take care of the car
and let me drive.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:45.875
- Can I make two suggestions?
- Not now, Larry!

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.802
Not a perfect fit,
but it'll have to hold!

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.472
- How bad is it?
- It might hold for 5 laps.

01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:58.474
It might hold for one.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:01.811
Either way, avoid being
slammed around out there!

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:08.572
Listen. You raced your heart
out there today, herbie.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:12.989
But if we keep going, that might
be it for you. Forever.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:17.531
Sorry. I'd rather lose
this race than lose you.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:25.080
Whoa! Oh! Are you sure?

01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:27.006
I can't believe jt

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:30.130
Maggie Peyton and herbie
are getting back on the track!

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.673
For a car,
you're not a good listener.

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:39.678
Ok, herbie. Let's finish this.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.651
Where is she, crash?
The bug! Where's the bug?

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:55.861
Focus on the win!

01:28:55.914 --> 01:29:00.032
The fans are pulling
for rookie driver Maggie Peyton,

01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:02.082
in a car she calls herbie.

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.049
Attagirl. Nice move.
Now go get 'em, Maggie!

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:12.673
Peyton on an incredible rally,

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.425
passing them left and right.

01:29:14.558 --> 01:29:18.392
Now up to second place,
behind trip Murphy. Amazing!

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:21.557
Come on.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:29.978
Did you miss us?

01:29:30.073 --> 01:29:32.906
This girl's really
beginning to tick me off.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:35.363
2 laps to go in a two-car race.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:38.991
Trip Murphy and Maggie Peyton
will settle this between them!

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:41.198
Go, Maggie!

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:43.329
- All right!
- We've got him now!

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:52.595
On the outside!

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:55.128
Go high, herbie.

01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:03.095
Come on, herbie.
We're almost there.

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:07.182
Door to door
off the corner at the final. Contact!

01:30:07.277 --> 01:30:09.313
Murphy slams
into the side of Peyton!

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:18.743
Mags, don't push it.
Mags, herbie can't take it.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:31.961
- Forget the bug and win!
- You're going down, bug!

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.465
Trouble in turn four!

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.142
Murphy into the wall
and upside down!

01:30:44.314 --> 01:30:48.227
Ok, herbie, you ready?

01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:50.684
- Keep it steady!
- Ahh!

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.612
No place to go!
Look out for the crash!

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:55.654
Herbie's

01:30:55.742 --> 01:30:58.654
herbie's on the fence!
Herbie's on the fence!

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:05.831
Oh! Oh, god!

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:13.294
Maggie Peyton won!

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:19.713
I've never seen anything
like this in Nascar,

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:23.346
not to mention the birth
of the next great Peyton!

01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:35.604
We did it.

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:41.568
Let's go!

01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:43.532
Whoo-hoo!

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:08.478
- Whoo!
- Yes!

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:14.233
I'm so proud of you!

01:32:14.279 --> 01:32:16.361
Thanks, dad.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:18.063
Maggie, that was awesome!

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:20.949
- Thank you.
- So great!

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:28.035
Hey! I thought
your depth perception...

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:30.037
Oh, well,

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:33.211
the best Peyton was on
the track today. You did it.

01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:36.131
- Congrats.
- Oh

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:37.840
look! Listen to me!

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:39.550
That car is possessed!

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:41.047
Trip!

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:44.597
I saw it too. It smiled at me!

01:32:45.769 --> 01:32:47.555
That car is alive!

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:50.978
You gotta believe me.
It's mocking me!

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:53.523
I'm telling you!
That car is alive!

01:32:55.653 --> 01:32:59.487
Look! It's doing it again!

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:02.657
You gotta believe me!
You gotta believe me!

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:04.530
This isn't the end, bug!

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:08.079
I'm going to get you, bug!
I'm going to get you!

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:11.784
He's fine. He's fine.
Just a little dehydrated.

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:14.661
Wow.

01:33:18.176 --> 01:33:21.293
Gotta say, Peyton, you and
herbie make a great team.

01:33:21.387 --> 01:33:23.719
We make a great team.

01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:27.265
Yeah, I thought we had good
driver-crew chief rapport there.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:29.809
Herbie, help me out here.

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:31.185
Wha

01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:00.833
All right, now, I'm gonna trust
you guys this time,

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.625
but you got
a big race coming up.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.258
Have her home at a decent hour.
Show some respect. All right?

01:34:06.349 --> 01:34:08.135
My house, my rules. Comprende?

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.718
Ok, ray, I think they got it.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:13.804
All right.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:16.389
Go on. Get out of here.

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:21.360
I mean it, herbie.

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:29.027
Rrrrr!
