WEBVTT

00:08.134 --> 00:10.052
Try anything smart,

00:10.136 --> 00:13.222
gonna put a hole
right in your pal's back.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.192
I thought you were my friend.

00:25.276 --> 00:29.447
I was. That's why I told you
not to take the job down here.

00:29.447 --> 00:33.409
What kind of cop are you?

00:33.409 --> 00:35.202
The kind that goes
where the money is.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.830
Old partner offered up

00:37.830 --> 00:39.665
protect a counterfeiting ring.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.585
But then you make me
a babysitter. I was hoping

00:42.585 --> 00:43.878
you'd just get run off course,

00:43.878 --> 00:45.504
this whole thing
would blow over, but no.

00:45.588 --> 00:48.340
You and this fuckin' ape
couldn't let things go.

00:48.424 --> 00:52.219
- Where's Roscoe?
- Oh, my girl's doing just fine.

00:54.346 --> 00:58.350
<i>Reacher, they want me
to tell you to do what they say,</i>

00:58.434 --> 01:03.022
<i>or me, Charlie and the kids...
they're gonna do to us</i>

01:03.022 --> 01:06.484
<i>what they did to Morrison.</i>

01:06.484 --> 01:08.861
Whatever you want,
I won't do it.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.071
No way you're letting them
walk away from this.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.157
- They know too much.
- You're smart.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.451
You, Finlay, Roscoe;
you're all dead.

01:15.451 --> 01:18.329
But I'd prefer to spare
Charlie and the kids.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.581
When civilian women
and children get killed,

01:20.581 --> 01:22.583
people get really worked up,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.919
more questions get asked.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.378
Yeah, I'm not worried
about 'em talking.

01:26.462 --> 01:27.963
Pretty sure they'll keep quiet

01:28.047 --> 01:29.840
after they watch
what I do to their dad.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.844
Hubble? You killed him already.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.387
He's on the run.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.015
Thought getting lost
would protect his family.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.059
He was wrong, but I want him.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.393
Last loose end.

01:41.477 --> 01:44.271
Let me guess why
loose ends concern you.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.607
Your father promised
some real bad guys overseas

01:46.607 --> 01:48.818
a hefty amount
of counterfeit cash.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.861
But thanks
to the Coast Guard blockade,

01:50.945 --> 01:53.989
those boys haven't gotten
what they paid for in a while.

01:54.073 --> 01:57.243
So they sent some Venezuelan
hitters to help you get...

01:57.243 --> 01:59.161
back on track.

01:59.245 --> 02:02.164
But things got real messy,
and pretty soon,

02:02.248 --> 02:04.124
those Venezuelans are gonna
give you the same necktie

02:04.208 --> 02:05.376
they gave your daddy.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.466
I killed my father.

02:13.509 --> 02:18.180
And I cut his throat, just like
I saw the Venezuelans do.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.015
See, the old man,
he had the brains

02:20.099 --> 02:22.935
to create this whole operation,
but he never had the guts

02:22.935 --> 02:25.312
to do what needed
to be done to protect it.

02:25.396 --> 02:28.732
And so, I hired
Picard's partner

02:28.816 --> 02:30.526
to go kill that agent
in Memphis,

02:30.526 --> 02:33.070
and I sent Dawson down there
to make sure it was done right.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.031
I killed Jobling.

02:36.115 --> 02:39.159
I had that bitch killed
in the subway.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.453
And I...

02:45.374 --> 02:47.877
I killed your brother.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.469
You shot Joe.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.890
Dawson kicked him
after he was dead,

03:00.890 --> 03:04.393
and Morrison covered him up.

03:04.393 --> 03:08.230
You know, after I bodied
Morrison, my old man lost it.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.316
He started talking about

03:10.316 --> 03:13.027
how he's gonna send me away
to an institution

03:13.027 --> 03:15.654
for a while for rest.

03:15.738 --> 03:20.034
He tried that once when I was
a kid, but it didn't take.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.952
- No shit.
- We'll make it look

03:22.036 --> 03:23.454
like the two crooked
Reacher brothers

03:23.454 --> 03:25.289
were working
with an out-of-town cop,

03:25.289 --> 03:28.208
running drugs or guns
or something nefarious

03:28.292 --> 03:30.920
through the virgin streets
of our Margrave.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.380
Roped in a banker
to finance it all,

03:33.464 --> 03:35.883
paid off some unscrupulous
local cops,

03:35.883 --> 03:38.719
and then, you all turned
on each other.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.387
You're gonna take Picard
to wherever

03:40.471 --> 03:42.640
Hubble's holed up, and
you're gonna bring him to me.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.183
How do you expect me to do that?

03:44.183 --> 03:45.935
You're a tracker, ain't ya?

03:45.935 --> 03:48.145
Go fucking find him.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.773
Then I'll trade Mommy
and the girls for Daddy.

03:50.773 --> 03:53.275
Picard's got
my number memorized.

03:53.359 --> 03:54.944
If I don't get a call from you

03:54.944 --> 03:58.197
by 6:00 a.m. saying
Hubble's in custody,

03:58.197 --> 04:01.533
ah, those four ladies
I'm holding die

04:01.617 --> 04:04.828
in ways you can't even imagine.

04:27.601 --> 04:31.063
I don't know how you think
I'm gonna find Hubble.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.773
Well, you have
till sunrise tomorrow,

04:32.773 --> 04:35.025
so I suggest you figure it out.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.694
We're just gonna be
driving aimlessly

04:36.694 --> 04:38.696
unless you let me
stop somewhere.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.864
I need a map
and a place to think.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.579
Okay, but try anything,
and this thing goes off.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.874
Understood.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.379
What can I get you fellas?

04:55.379 --> 04:57.256
Black coffee, peach pie.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.632
Nothing for me.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.428
Dessert?

05:02.428 --> 05:06.140
Been trying to get my hands
on that pie for a while.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.225
- Give me a pen.
- You expect me

05:08.225 --> 05:10.811
to hand you something
you can use as a weapon?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.355
Hey, the food's ready.
Here you go.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.316
<i>♪ Down by the river where the...</i>

05:16.400 --> 05:18.152
This scare you?

05:20.154 --> 05:23.115
All right.

05:24.158 --> 05:27.327
<i>Down by the river ♪</i>

05:27.411 --> 05:29.788
<i>♪ Where them springtime
flowers bloom</i> ♪

05:34.835 --> 05:37.212
<i>♪ I've been waiting
there for you...</i>

05:39.048 --> 05:41.467
He's in Augusta.

05:41.467 --> 05:44.136
Oh. Just like that?

05:44.136 --> 05:48.098
I chased down AWOLs for a
living, know how they think.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.684
If I were Hubble,
I'd go to Augusta.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.478
Why?

05:52.478 --> 05:56.190
He knew to protect his family
he had to get away from 'em,

05:56.190 --> 05:58.901
but not too far in case
he felt the need to go back.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.779
So he ran off to Atlanta,
about an hour from Margrave.

06:01.779 --> 06:05.741
Figured, big city, lots of
people makes it easy to hide.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.202
Then he realized more people
means more chances

06:08.202 --> 06:10.996
of being spotted, especially
in a town where his old bank

06:11.080 --> 06:12.247
has a branch in it.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.208
- So he left.
- To Augusta?

06:14.208 --> 06:17.920
Athens. Just over two hours
from Margrave.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.548
It's hard for a man,
if he's halfway decent,

06:21.632 --> 06:22.925
to leave his family behind.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.551
It's done in stages.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.179
But Athens is home
to University of Georgia,

06:27.179 --> 06:28.764
where Paul and Charlie
went to college.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.849
It's a place directly
linked to Hubble,

06:30.933 --> 06:32.851
and one of the first places
they'd look.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.937
He'd move on after a day.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.980
So Augusta is next?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.233
Over three hours away,
but still close enough

06:39.233 --> 06:41.735
he feels connected
to his wife and kids.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.612
Plus, Hubble's a golfer.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.531
He's played Augusta.
It means nice memories

06:45.531 --> 06:47.950
in a city he's been to before.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.785
It soothes him
in a time of stress,

06:49.785 --> 06:52.329
like when his mom used
to sing him "Rocky Raccoon."

06:54.123 --> 06:55.833
Bullshit.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.794
You can't just
stare into something

06:58.794 --> 07:00.963
and get inside a man's head
like that.

07:00.963 --> 07:04.216
I didn't offer my help.
You assholes demanded it.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.135
Right now you're wondering

07:06.135 --> 07:08.887
what's the best time
and place to kill me.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.098
You know you'll need
to take me by surprise

07:11.098 --> 07:13.433
'cause you're not sure
if you can take me

07:13.517 --> 07:15.727
if I know it's coming.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.272
Let me save you the trouble.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.732
You can't.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.152
So if I were you,

07:23.152 --> 07:25.737
I'd take me by surprise.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.908
Coffee, black,

07:29.992 --> 07:32.119
and a slice of peach.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.370
Thank you.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.290
- Oh. Ugh.
- Oh.
- Oh.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.666
- That's my fault.
- Why don't y'all take another booth

07:37.666 --> 07:39.126
- while I clean this up?
- No, no.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.752
Actually, we got to go.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.382
You better be right
about Augusta.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.077
Got to say, you're a little
tougher than I thought you were.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.374
And you're exactly
what I thought you were.

08:38.310 --> 08:42.147
Oh.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.153
Low tire pressure.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.238
We should check it out.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.822
Keep driving.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.411
Got a flat.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.497
No way we make it to Augusta.

08:59.498 --> 09:00.874
You being cute?

09:00.958 --> 09:02.834
You've been with me
the whole time.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.673
Fine. Just... pull over.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.558
You think I'm gonna
leave you alone here

09:18.642 --> 09:21.728
while I go and change
the damn thing? Get to work.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.695
And if you're thinking
about throwing a tire iron

09:29.695 --> 09:31.488
in my direction, think again.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.115
Not my plan.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.668
KJ's waiting on my call.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.587
My voice is the only thing

09:47.671 --> 09:50.090
that's keeping Charlie
and those kids alive.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.343
You shoot me, I ain't
the only person you're killing.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.512
Guess I didn't
think that through.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.641
But if you shoot me,
you're never finding Hubble.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.856
I guess
we need each other, then.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.900
Okay, fine.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.986
I'm not gonna kill you.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.488
You gonna kill me?

10:15.198 --> 10:17.117
No.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.827
You have my word.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.871
Your word doesn't mean shit,

10:20.871 --> 10:23.123
but I don't have
many options right now.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.668
So on "one,"

10:26.752 --> 10:29.463
we raise our guns up
over our heads.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.716
On "two,"

10:32.716 --> 10:35.218
- we lay 'em on the trunk.
- I know what

10:35.302 --> 10:37.429
a gun hitting metal sounds like,
so don't you fuck with me!

10:37.429 --> 10:39.598
And on "three,"

10:39.598 --> 10:42.976
we stand up
and face each other, hands up.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.229
Then I take two steps back,

10:46.313 --> 10:48.523
and you come get my piece.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.526
Got it?

10:51.610 --> 10:54.071
Yeah, I got it.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.867
Okay.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.869
One.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.920
Two.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.466
Three.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.551
Oh!

11:42.411 --> 11:44.579
Find motels within three miles
of Augusta bus station.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.790
Your input
is being processed.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.995
Hello, Hubble.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.393
Ladies.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.604
Here's where we are.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.440
Your boyfriend is out looking
for her coward of a husband.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.151
Might be a while,
so stay comfortable.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.865
Your daddy's caused us
a lot of problems.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.618
Did you know that?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.454
No.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.663
Please. No.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.081
It's okay. No, it's okay.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.500
You go with him. Go with him.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.126
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.670
- Come on! Don't do this!
- But I have to.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.131
'Cause you and your friends
are troublemakers.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.383
Get down and stay quiet.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.512
Just like your old pal, Gray, was a troublemaker.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.724
Sure had good taste
in guns, though.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.518
We'll keep them someplace safe

13:29.518 --> 13:31.269
as insurance,
things goes smoothly.

13:31.353 --> 13:35.398
Things don't, they might fall
into one of those chemical tubs.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.739
Okay.
That's how you guessed

13:42.739 --> 13:44.866
what city I was in.
How'd you find my motel?

13:44.950 --> 13:47.494
Use credit cards, and Kliner
finds you, so you use cash,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.371
which means travel by bus.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.997
Needed the money to last,

13:51.081 --> 13:53.208
so low-rent motels
were your only option.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.626
Found a cluster of motels

13:54.626 --> 13:56.336
within walking distance
of the bus depot.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.463
You'd use
a pay-by-the-hour joint

13:58.547 --> 14:00.215
which looks the other way
on ID requirements.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.342
Well, how'd you guess my alias?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.719
People use the names
of things they like.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.471
You love the Beatles.

14:06.555 --> 14:10.141
Started with the first
"Harrison."

14:12.143 --> 14:14.604
You really think
they'll let my family go?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.356
No.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.442
They said that just
to get me to cooperate.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.653
Their plan is to kill all of us,

14:21.653 --> 14:23.029
just like
they killed my brother.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.741
Your treasury contact.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.451
Mark Salas?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.203
That's just the name
he gave you.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.038
Real name's Joe.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.332
Mark Salas played for
the Yankees in the late '80s.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.381
I'm sorry... about Joe.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.968
I'd heard rumors the Coast Guard
blockade was being lifted.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.345
Venezuelans were breathing
down Kliner's neck

14:47.429 --> 14:49.139
'cause production had
ground to a halt.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.558
But I knew,
with the blockade ending,

14:51.558 --> 14:54.644
I had to try to get out before
business was underway again.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.898
So I-I left a message
on a federal tip line.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.610
- And Joe called you back.
- At first it was just me

15:01.610 --> 15:03.445
helping in exchange
for immunity.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.323
But then I noticed
cash was going missing.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.117
And I tied it
to a truck driver.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.369
- Pete Jobling.
- He tried to deny it, but

15:11.453 --> 15:13.496
when I told him I'd seen
Kliner's guys kill someone

15:13.580 --> 15:17.459
right in front of me,
he-he... went white.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.796
So I put him in touch with Joe.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.424
Kliner must've already
had eyes on Jobling.

15:26.301 --> 15:30.138
I'm sorry, Reacher.
I... got your brother killed.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.015
No, you didn't.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.558
KJ killed Joe.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.685
The kid?

15:35.769 --> 15:39.314
Killed Joe and Morrison,
Stevenson and his wife,

15:39.314 --> 15:41.399
even killed his own father.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.402
Holy shit.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.404
If you want
to keep your family alive,

15:46.488 --> 15:48.114
you need to listen
to me carefully

15:48.198 --> 15:49.532
and do everything I say.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.409
Okay.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.996
Can I ask you one question?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.623
Okay.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.000
Why are two
of my windows tinted?

16:08.677 --> 16:10.804
Keys to Dawson's truck are
inside. I'll be right back.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.222
Oh, I'll come with you.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.765
You don't want to see in there.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.976
Lots of blood and mud
and busted-up shit.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.064
Guess my cleaning lady's
gonna be pissed.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.400
Not as pissed as your pool guy.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.865
I'm bored.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.826
<i>♪ Now she's spending
her nights...</i>

16:32.826 --> 16:34.411
Maybe I'll uncuff you
for a while.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.872
Make the fight
more interesting.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.166
<i>I still wonder why ♪</i>

16:40.250 --> 16:41.501
Yeah.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.754
<i>She can't shake his memory ♪</i>

16:44.838 --> 16:47.298
<i>♪ We don't talk about the lies...</i>

16:47.382 --> 16:50.343
Hey, somebody's
texting you, buddy.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.220
Oh, I'll get it.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.474
<i>I wish that I knew ♪</i>

16:56.558 --> 16:59.978
<i>♪ That her love could be true...</i>

16:59.978 --> 17:02.856
"Duck and cover"?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.566
What the hell does that mean?

17:31.551 --> 17:32.802
You okay?

17:32.886 --> 17:35.096
I'll live.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.998
I can't help
but see you're alone.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.584
If they don't get
Picard's call by 6:00...

18:04.584 --> 18:06.294
Won't need till 6:00.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.631
- Hubble?
- Yup.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.096
I got Finlay.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.265
I noticed.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.145
Well, it's good
to see you alive.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.855
All right.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.816
Let's hit the gun locker,
the ammo safe.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.526
Grab anything useful.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.294
This place have a hose out back?

18:48.378 --> 18:49.546
Yeah. Why?

18:49.546 --> 18:52.382
We're gonna need it.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.509
It's okay. She's with me.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.679
- Boss.
- Neagley, this is Finlay and Hubble.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.764
Finlay and Hubble, Neagley.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.516
Fellas.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.518
How is she here?

19:03.518 --> 19:05.687
Our last phone call,
I asked Reacher

19:05.687 --> 19:07.438
how he knew Picard was involved.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.025
He said, "Lucky guess."

19:11.109 --> 19:14.863
Reacher believes in facts
and statistics, not luck.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.199
Might as well have
shouted "Mayday."

19:19.200 --> 19:21.244
Where's your lady friend?

19:23.371 --> 19:26.958
Oh. Fuck.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.334
Let's get to work.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.420
Thanks for letting us
set up here.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.171
Sorry for the late hour.

19:32.255 --> 19:35.675
I'm just glad
Kliner's gonna get his.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.433
I'm gonna go upstairs
and put on some coffee.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.728
All right. I've been
in here a million times.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.813
This is the layout.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.356
Probably holding Roscoe

19:50.440 --> 19:52.025
and Charlie
somewhere around here.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.318
Out of the way
and cornered, but where

19:53.318 --> 19:54.569
they can still
keep an eye on 'em.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.279
What about my kids?

19:56.279 --> 19:58.740
They're being held
someplace else.

19:58.740 --> 20:02.243
Psych tactic to make sure
Charlie and Roscoe behave.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.953
Probably up here.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.079
Lock 'em up in there,
you don't have

20:05.163 --> 20:06.247
to waste a man watching 'em.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.799
Two by the door,

20:16.883 --> 20:18.593
one around the corner
by the exterior staircase.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.970
Lot of firepower
for a guy

20:21.054 --> 20:22.847
who doesn't believe
in security cameras.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.603
It's for me.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.813
They think you're with Picard.
You're not a threat.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.398
Ah, they know me by now.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.108
Their ideal world?
Hubble and I get marched

20:34.192 --> 20:35.944
through the front door,
and they kill all of us.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.737
They suspect I won't
go down lightly

20:37.737 --> 20:39.906
so they put guns outside,
and probably a dozen men inside

20:39.906 --> 20:43.201
armed to the teeth in case
I somehow go in guns blazing.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.870
So what do we do?

20:45.954 --> 20:47.747
We go in blazing.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.874
Neagley, we need to take out
those two guards facing us

20:49.958 --> 20:51.417
quietly, without one of them

20:51.501 --> 20:53.169
setting off
an automatic weapon.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.088
They won't make a sound.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.131
Good. Double-check your weapon,
ready your shot.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.217
- Copy.
- Hubble, come with me.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.647
Safe to say
you never shot anyone before?

21:13.690 --> 21:16.859
- I've never fired a gun.
- Okay.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.238
All you got to do is
extend, aim, fire.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.240
No point in having a weapon

21:22.240 --> 21:23.825
unless it's ready
for instant use.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.994
You hesitate, you die. Uh...

21:27.829 --> 21:29.247
Only point it at the bad guys.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.848
Love the smell of gasoline.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.184
The tweed comes off.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.520
Feel like we should all
bow our heads or something.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.190
I don't want to get any
of their blood on it.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.027
Good attitude.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.618
- Are you Catholic?
- Yeah.

22:11.122 --> 22:14.417
Listen, I know
we've spent most of our time

22:14.417 --> 22:17.045
together fighting,

22:17.045 --> 22:20.465
but I bet your soldiers
really enjoyed working with you.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.844
I enjoyed working with you, too.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.598
You know, it's hard
to tell with the suit on,

22:28.598 --> 22:30.141
but you're kind of
jacked, Finlay.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.770
Really?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.354
No.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.817
Asshole.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.744
Fucking shit.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.956
Hey.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.959
You've got
to get your shit together.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.253
They're gonna... kill us.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.130
- They're gonna kill my children.
- No.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.467
Hey, listen to me, okay?

23:04.467 --> 23:06.344
I know Reacher.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.638
There's no way in hell
that he is just gonna

23:08.638 --> 23:10.681
roll over
and take this loss, okay?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.936
Sometime before 6:00,

23:14.936 --> 23:16.938
he is gonna come knocking,

23:16.938 --> 23:19.899
and KJ's gonna wish
he never started this fight.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.863
Reacher and Hubble
should be in place by now.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.032
Really think I should
take one of the shots.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.159
Two shooters, better odds.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.788
You have experience
with long-range kill shots?

23:33.788 --> 23:35.790
No.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.918
I do.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.969
Put the biscuit in the basket.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.727
Our friend around the corner
heard 'em fall.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.153
Go, go, go, go, go.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.837
Soon as it's lit, you move.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.922
Got it.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.467
Your only job is
to get your kids out of there.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.512
Don't let anyone stop you
from doing your job.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.102
All right. Time to shine.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.937
Wait.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.149
I got this.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.613
If I'm gonna die,

24:48.613 --> 24:52.074
I'm goin' to flavor country
one last time.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.709
Yeah.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.962
Are we gonna die?

25:05.046 --> 25:07.506
Let's find out.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.945
- What the hell was that?
- That's Reacher knocking.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.907
What the hell
is going on?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.581
Get over there!
Put out the fire!

25:40.665 --> 25:44.460
Move your ass! Move it!

26:18.953 --> 26:22.248
Everybody in here now!

26:54.697 --> 26:56.198
Charlie!

26:56.282 --> 26:59.201
Paul! Paul, go!
They're in there.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.583
Oh, fuck!

27:07.126 --> 27:09.670
Oh. Okay. Okay.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.339
Okay. Okay.

27:11.339 --> 27:15.092
Fuck. Give me your hands!
Give me your hands!

27:18.012 --> 27:18.929
Dad?

27:19.013 --> 27:20.765
Come on. Come on.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.108
I got them!

27:31.192 --> 27:33.527
- Mom!
- Run! Go!

27:33.611 --> 27:35.696
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go. Go!

27:35.780 --> 27:38.449
- Go.
- It's okay. Just...

27:40.326 --> 27:43.120
Go! Go! No, you're good. You're good.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.753
Down. Get down.
Down, down, down. Stay down.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.221
He's over here!

28:21.659 --> 28:24.870
Yes. Okay. Okay.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.415
I'm gonna take you out of here.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.127
You good?

29:02.366 --> 29:05.077
- Go get your kids.
- Thank you.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.250
- Come on!
- Paul!

29:11.250 --> 29:13.252
Come on.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.629
- Oh, get down. Get down.
- Yeah.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.272
Finlay, is that you?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.441
I know you're here.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.944
Picard,
I thought you were dead.

29:39.028 --> 29:41.489
Not yet.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.837
No!

30:07.097 --> 30:08.891
Oh!

31:11.662 --> 31:13.664
No! No!

31:18.168 --> 31:19.920
Stop!

31:20.004 --> 31:21.547
Don't fuckin' do that.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.317
Neagley.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.572
There's too much
smoke. We gotta go!

31:49.116 --> 31:52.244
Roscoe! Over here.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.626
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

31:58.626 --> 32:01.337
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.804
Where is he?

32:10.888 --> 32:12.806
- We've got to go get Reacher.
- He'll be okay.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.975
How do you know that?

32:15.059 --> 32:17.311
Because he's Reacher.

32:17.311 --> 32:19.313
- Roscoe, let's go.
- What are you doing?

32:31.200 --> 32:32.826
Hey!

32:32.910 --> 32:36.163
I think it might be just
you and me now, Reacher!

32:46.799 --> 32:50.177
Let me tell you a story, Jack.

32:50.177 --> 32:54.390
So, a couple years ago,

32:54.390 --> 32:57.434
I'm on safari
in the savanna.

32:57.518 --> 33:01.021
There's a dawn fog as thick
as my dead daddy's bankroll.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.941
It made the smoke in here
look like mist.

33:03.941 --> 33:06.735
But through all that soup,

33:06.819 --> 33:10.197
I spot this big old rhinoceros.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.574
Six thousand pounds
if he's an ounce,

33:12.658 --> 33:14.827
and he's just sitting there

33:14.827 --> 33:17.621
chewing grass.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.421
Now, the rhino knew
I was out there.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.631
He could sense me.

33:29.717 --> 33:32.052
Feel me.

33:32.136 --> 33:34.096
But it was foggy,

33:34.096 --> 33:35.681
the light's bad,

33:35.681 --> 33:38.517
and rhinos are nearsighted
as hell.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.353
And so I just walked

33:41.437 --> 33:46.442
right up to his big, dumb ass

33:46.442 --> 33:47.818
and killed him.

33:52.072 --> 33:56.535
You see, that stupid rhino

33:56.535 --> 33:59.246
wasn't smart enough
to realize

33:59.246 --> 34:01.415
he was overmatched.

34:01.415 --> 34:06.128
He thought he could just
lumber through life,

34:06.128 --> 34:08.046
go wherever he wanted...

34:10.799 --> 34:14.094
...do whatever he wanted,

34:14.178 --> 34:17.556
fuck whoever he wanted,

34:17.556 --> 34:19.725
all without consequence.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.149
But in life,

34:27.149 --> 34:30.819
there's always consequences.

34:30.903 --> 34:33.530
There was one for that rhino.

34:35.365 --> 34:39.036
That's why his head's up
in my daddy's hallway.

34:39.036 --> 34:42.664
Right next to
where yours will go.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.242
It's over.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.231
Hello, Reacher.

37:57.401 --> 37:58.443
You're okay?

37:58.527 --> 38:00.988
I'm okay, Joe.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.365
Remember what I taught you.

38:03.365 --> 38:06.743
No matter what,
you don't cry.

38:18.005 --> 38:20.674
<i>Mes fils. Venez.</i>

38:20.674 --> 38:23.969
<i>Embrassez votre mère.</i>

38:23.969 --> 38:26.638
<i>- Bonjour, maman.
- </i> Mmm.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.434
<i>C'est bon. Bien.</i>

38:30.434 --> 38:32.394
<i>Bonjour, maman. Ca va?</i>

38:32.394 --> 38:33.854
<i>Ca va?</i>

38:33.854 --> 38:36.273
I'm dying, silly boy.

38:36.273 --> 38:39.693
But I am so happy...

38:39.693 --> 38:41.737
...to see my sons.

38:44.614 --> 38:47.159
I have connections
through my job.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.869
I can get you to the States

38:48.869 --> 38:51.413
- to see experts.
- My dearest Joseph,

38:51.413 --> 38:54.291
what did I always tell you? Hmm.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.917
I want to hear it.

39:01.089 --> 39:04.801
I don't need to solve
all the world's problems.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.762
Solving some is more
than enough.

39:06.762 --> 39:10.015
And Reacher.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.185
You have the strength
of three men.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.520
What will you do will
all that strength?

39:17.230 --> 39:19.483
I'm going to do
the right thing, Mom.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.277
I know you will.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.446
You always have.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.324
Even when what was right
was unpleasant.

39:29.743 --> 39:32.204
Ever since you were
a young boy in Okinawa.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.247
No?

39:35.707 --> 39:38.710
You knew...

39:38.794 --> 39:42.798
that I beat up Curtis Bishop
in Okinawa.

39:42.798 --> 39:45.008
You never believed it was Joe.

39:45.092 --> 39:48.637
He wanted to tell you
the truth, Mom.

39:48.637 --> 39:49.805
I wouldn't let him.

39:49.805 --> 39:52.015
You were saving him.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.559
That is who you are.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.438
And you protected
a special boy from torment.

39:58.522 --> 40:03.026
Your father and I never
saw any need

40:03.110 --> 40:05.821
to prevent either of you
from following your natures.

40:07.948 --> 40:11.451
Your natures are pure,

40:11.535 --> 40:14.204
like your hearts.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.042
I need to make a quick call.
I'll be right back.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.236
Your grandfather's war medal.

40:50.365 --> 40:54.119
For bravery
in the face of danger.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.374
It takes bravery
to do what's right.

41:21.062 --> 41:24.316
Now you can cry, Reacher.

41:38.288 --> 41:43.126
So the staties and the Feds
are gonna come knocking.

41:43.210 --> 41:45.587
They're gonna want you
to stick around for a few days

41:45.587 --> 41:49.090
and answer their questions.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.343
I don't like answering
questions.

41:51.343 --> 41:54.512
And you don't like
sticking around.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.978
A hundred thousand years ago
there were people

42:02.062 --> 42:06.733
who stayed by the campfire
and people who wandered.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.693
I'm pretty sure
I'm a direct descendent

42:08.777 --> 42:12.364
of the wandering type.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.449
It's just who I am.

42:17.369 --> 42:18.703
If there was anyone
who could make me

42:18.787 --> 42:20.330
stay close to the flame,
it would be you.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.465
Hmm.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.592
Well...

42:34.803 --> 42:39.224
...if you ever find yourself
wandering by here again...

42:39.224 --> 42:41.685
give me a call.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.319
I will.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.450
What are you gonna do?

43:01.288 --> 43:05.250
I'm gonna rebuild the town
my family built.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.751
You should run for mayor.

43:08.169 --> 43:09.963
Hear there's an opening.

43:17.178 --> 43:19.472
Wow.

43:19.556 --> 43:21.725
That's not a half-bad idea.

44:05.185 --> 44:06.519
Hey, boy.

44:06.603 --> 44:09.898
Finlay got you watching
his car?

44:09.898 --> 44:11.524
Making you listen to shit music?

44:16.112 --> 44:18.698
He got you a tweed collar.

44:36.758 --> 44:38.927
Oh, excuse me.

44:38.927 --> 44:41.012
Sorry.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.198
I knew you'd stop here
before leaving town.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.991
I'm getting predictable.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.911
Later than I thought, though.

45:04.911 --> 45:07.664
Roscoe's not easy
to walk away from, huh?

45:11.459 --> 45:12.877
Thank you.

45:14.379 --> 45:15.797
So the Feds are freaking out
because of

45:15.797 --> 45:17.549
Picard's involvement and all.

45:17.549 --> 45:19.134
They want to interview you.

45:19.134 --> 45:21.344
- What'd you tell 'em?
- That they'll never find you.

45:21.428 --> 45:24.180
But they're still in town
down by the warehouse,

45:24.264 --> 45:25.807
and you kind of stand out, so...

45:25.807 --> 45:27.434
I'll be gone as soon as
we're done here.

45:27.434 --> 45:30.270
Good. Smart.

45:32.897 --> 45:36.401
Listen, I'm not big
on goodbyes and all,

45:36.401 --> 45:40.238
and I'm sure
you're not either, but...

45:40.238 --> 45:42.240
if you hadn't come to Margrave,
I would have never

45:42.240 --> 45:43.283
figured out what was going on,

45:43.283 --> 45:44.492
or I would have wound up dead.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.286
You would have figured it out
eventually.

45:46.286 --> 45:47.787
I appreciate that.

45:47.871 --> 45:48.997
And then you would have
wound up dead.

45:53.251 --> 45:56.713
You may be an animal,
but deep down you're all right.

45:56.713 --> 45:58.339
You may be an uptight
pain in the ass,

45:58.423 --> 45:59.716
but you're all right, too.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.677
And a hell of a cop.

46:02.677 --> 46:05.889
Well, not for long.

46:05.889 --> 46:07.557
I'm done with police work.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.809
- Boston?
- Mm-hmm.

46:09.893 --> 46:12.520
Gonna stay here a few weeks,
help Roscoe get things in order,

46:12.604 --> 46:13.897
and then I'm going home.

46:13.897 --> 46:17.650
Time to stop spinning,
stop running away, you know?

46:17.734 --> 46:20.403
Sharon would want me
to live a life.

46:20.487 --> 46:24.032
And not live it alone.

46:24.032 --> 46:27.035
Yeah.

46:27.035 --> 46:30.788
Think I'm ready
to take care of someone again.

46:30.872 --> 46:32.457
Besides, I couldn't leave Jack
in the shelter.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.667
Jack?

46:34.751 --> 46:36.753
Yeah, he needed a name,
and you weren't using it,

46:36.753 --> 46:38.338
Reacher, so Jack it is.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.634
You know, I shouldn't be
the only one

46:42.634 --> 46:44.344
shaking up his snow globe.

46:44.344 --> 46:45.887
There are more people out there

46:45.887 --> 46:47.805
like Roscoe and I
than you think.

46:47.889 --> 46:50.850
You should try
letting them in sometime.

46:53.436 --> 46:54.938
- Noted.
- Okay, well,

46:54.938 --> 46:56.606
as one of my last
official acts

46:56.606 --> 46:59.067
- as Chief Detective...
- You were fired.

46:59.067 --> 47:00.693
By a dead man,
so it didn't stick.

47:00.777 --> 47:04.155
So as one of my last official
acts as Chief Detective,

47:04.239 --> 47:06.407
I need to right a wrong
that took place

47:06.491 --> 47:10.828
at this very spot about
a week and a half ago.

47:10.912 --> 47:13.540
Slice of peach.
Best in Georgia.

47:13.540 --> 47:16.459
Thank you.

47:16.543 --> 47:18.211
You're gonna eat that?

47:18.211 --> 47:21.256
It's got sugar and fat,
you know?

47:21.256 --> 47:23.550
Shut up and eat
your damn pie.

47:30.223 --> 47:32.100
Mmm.

47:33.142 --> 47:34.143
So, worth the wait?

47:36.604 --> 47:37.855
I've had better.

48:27.488 --> 48:30.575
It takes bravery to solve
the world's problems, too, Joe.
