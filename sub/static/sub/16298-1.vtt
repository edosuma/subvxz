- Water landing.
- Captain?

04:29.840 --> 04:31.671
This was not a crash
and it wasn't a ditching.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.949
We knew what we were
trying to execute here.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.155
It was not a...

04:36.320 --> 04:38.436
It was not a crash.
It was a forced water landing.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.440
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.391
There simply was not enough altitude.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.240
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough and smooth enough

04:48.360 --> 04:50.720
and wide enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.920
BEN: Air Traffic testified

04:52.040 --> 04:53.920
that you stated
you were returning to LaGuardia,

04:53.960 --> 04:55.552
but you did not.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.392
As I began the left turn,

04:59.560 --> 05:02.028
I realized I couldn't make it back

05:02.200 --> 05:04.136
and it would have eliminated
all the other options.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.080
Returning to LaGuardia
would have been a mistake.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.736
Okay, well, let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.120
There was no time for calculating.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.632
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude and speed

05:13.800 --> 05:15.870
of thousands of flights over four decades.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.616
You're saying you didn't do any...

05:17.640 --> 05:19.119
I eyeballed it.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.431
You eyeballed it?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.473
Yes.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.598
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.634
And I'd bet my life on it.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.074
In fact, I did.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.993
And I would do it again.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.957
Aviation engineers are theorizing

05:34.120 --> 05:36.156
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.795
Well, engineers are not pilots.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.598
They're wrong.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.519
And they weren't there.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.136
Regardless, we have to follow up
on all implications

05:46.160 --> 05:47.752
as part of our investigation.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.434
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.160
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.197
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.590
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.069
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.920
BEN: Not possible during an investigation.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.555
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure

06:04.760 --> 06:07.035
due to multiple bird strikes?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.031
That would be unprecedented.

06:09.560 --> 06:13.473
Well, everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.520
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

06:18.640 --> 06:20.039
Eight hours. Enough.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.918
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

06:22.080 --> 06:24.958
I was rested, alert
and completely aware of my surroundings.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.296
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.320

06:29.680 --> 06:30.680
No. Never.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.311
Uh, don't drink. Never have.

any troubles at home lately?

And nothing that affected my work.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.757
It's bullshit.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.390
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned out right?

06:57.600 --> 06:58.816
It didn't turn out all right
for the airline

06:58.840 --> 07:00.114

07:00.280 --> 07:01.998

12:28.360 --> 12:29.395
Great.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.196
All right. Be down there in five minutes.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.718
You enjoying the shakes?

12:40.520 --> 12:42.158
The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.360
A little bit.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.317
Union's offering us counseling.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.511
(SCOFFS) Yeah. What are they gonna say?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.717
"You were in a plane crash and lived.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.269
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

12:52.720 --> 12:55.678
I don't like not being
in control of the process.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.876
- I want my self back.
- Yeah.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.480
I'm hoping six months from now,
we'll just be laughing

13:00.560 --> 13:02.676
about how we got to meet David Letterman.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.111
We're doing David Letterman?

13:07.280 --> 13:09.350
Yeah. Right after the next NTSB interview.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.600
Letterman.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.269
SKILES: I'm guessing Dave
is gonna be slightly funnier.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.708
SULLY: This is so surreal.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.758
I guess I'm having a little trouble

13:16.920 --> 13:19.718
separating reality
from whatever the hell this is.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.029
Yeah.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.395
This is two men freezing their asses off.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.075
Sully.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.556
Don't worry. You did a great thing.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.870
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.752
Here's the funny thing.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.230
I've delivered a million passengers
over 40 years in the air,

13:39.120 --> 13:43.079
but in the end,
I'm gonna be judged on 208 seconds.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.196
Come on. Tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

13:48.760 --> 13:52.150
Computer sims will prove you were right.
We can all put our wings back on.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.673
You wanna run?

13:53.840 --> 13:55.068
Yeah, let's run.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.708
(BOTH EXHALING LOUDLY)

13:59.080 --> 14:00.638
SKILES: Fucking cold out here.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.753
It was obvious.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.319
It was a critical situation,

14:04.920 --> 14:08.913
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude

14:09.280 --> 14:13.273
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.595
But choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big "if."

14:19.520 --> 14:21.351
I was sure I could do it.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.954
You were?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.514
Yes.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.192
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.435
I don't feel like a hero.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.950
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.874
The right man for the job
at the right time.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.790
You've been flying for what,
nearly 40 years?

14:43.440 --> 14:46.000
Forty-two. It's been my life.

Still six bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.354
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.
Just learn from them.

and this is important.

- I apologize for the perspiration.
- Oh, no.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.640
After what you did,

15:59.880 --> 16:01.840
I'd think that Katie
couldn't be too intimidating.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.074
Oh, it wasn't Katie.

16:03.240 --> 16:06.198
It was the lights and the camera
that she brought with her.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.153
Okay. All done.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.430

There's something else.
Arnie Gentile called.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.639
He has the ACARS data.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.155
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.313
Not possible. I felt it go.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.232
It was like we were stopped in midair.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.914
Arnie said there was a chance
it was sub-idle,

17:53.080 --> 17:54.877
that it still could've had thrust.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.837
I'm just letting you know
since the NTSB already does.

We've been through all this before.

CHARLES: Look,
I'm sorry if you're frustrated,

18:31.120 --> 18:34.157
but our job is to investigate
how a plane ended up in the Hudson River.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.992
- On the Hudson River.
- (SLURPS)

18:40.200 --> 18:42.839
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.514
Seeking the facts
is hardly "fishing," Mr. Skiles.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.256
SKILES: Okay,
then here's the most important fact.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.776
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit that day

18:49.800 --> 18:50.800
and I'm one of them.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.360
And we appreciate your perspective.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.316
Why do you even think we're here today?

18:56.440 --> 18:59.989
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.713
Look, I just finished training on the A320
and I can tell you,

19:04.880 --> 19:06.856
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did,

19:06.880 --> 19:08.438
that the aircraft could land anywhere,

19:08.720 --> 19:11.360
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.516
He was simply following the QRH.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.159
No. No, he wasn't.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.117
He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.475
And I know, because
I had the QRH in my hands.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.554
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.551
According to Airbus,
that's the 15th thing on the list to do.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.039
Fifteenth.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.880
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.792
Maybe that's the part you don't like.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.996
You're not used to having
answers to your guesses.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.838
Look, what Jeff is saying

19:40.000 --> 19:44.152
is that I know the A320,
what it does and what it doesn't do.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.074
I have read countless CVR transcripts
of deceased pilots

19:48.240 --> 19:50.800
and I have significant
accident investigation experience.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.231
CHARLES: There is no question

19:53.480 --> 19:57.632
that you are a talented, dedicated,
experienced professional.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.354
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th

20:00.520 --> 20:03.876
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview of this investigation.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.034
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.598
Your union has been advised.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.273
ACARS data relayed that the left engine

20:13.480 --> 20:15.311
continued to turn throughout the flight.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.078
Then the ACARS data is wrong.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.912
The evidence shows that the left engine

20:19.080 --> 20:22.356
was at idle or sub-idle
immediately following the bird strike.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.876
You show me the left engine,
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

20:26.040 --> 20:30.272
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.635
But we can circle back to that later.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.678
Let's just assume that it was,
as you say,

20:35.880 --> 20:38.348
- a dual engine loss due to bird strike.

- Agree?
- Correct.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.656
BEN: We were able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.117
And the resulting computer simulations
of US Airways Flight 1549

20:57.280 --> 21:00.078
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.439
There was enough altitude and speed
after the bird strike

21:03.600 --> 21:05.955
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.875
Successful?

21:08.040 --> 21:10.395
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.875
Intact.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.948
Undamaged.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.156
You got that from one computer simulation?

21:16.320 --> 21:17.355
BEN: No.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.680
From 20.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.190
Including attempts made for
Teterboro runways 1-9

21:22.360 --> 21:25.670
and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

21:25.840 --> 21:29.515
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters

21:29.720 --> 21:33.110
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.872
And not just possible, probable.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.028
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

21:44.640 --> 21:46.358
Captain Sullenberger?

21:47.560 --> 21:48.788
First Officer Skiles?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.752
Not at this time.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.753
I would like to go over
the parameters that were used.

We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

I'm just anxious

24:39.480 --> 24:41.869
and I'm alone and not enough sleep.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
Yeah, I know.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.590
Not a lot of sleep going on here either.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.591
I'm sorry if I'm adding to your stress.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.149
But just tell me
you'll be back in the air soon.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.632
Not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.799
LORRIE: We need you flying.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.918
SULLY: Lorr, if this goes badly,

24:59.080 --> 25:04.074
my career as a safety expert
will end as a website and a business card.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.515
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.591
What if I did blow this?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.638
What are you saying?

25:15.520 --> 25:19.149
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

25:19.920 --> 25:23.196
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

25:23.640 --> 25:28.350
Sully, watch the news. You're a hero.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.114
Everyone's gonna have to get used to it,
including the NTSB.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.272
Worst case scenario,

25:34.440 --> 25:37.159
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.959
That's immediate retirement. No pension.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.675
My life's work gone.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.957
Okay, you're scaring me now, Sully.
What is going on?

25:45.720 --> 25:48.996
(SIGHS) The left engine might have
still been idling.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.872
And the Airbus simulations say

25:52.040 --> 25:54.998
I could've made it back
to LaGuardia safely.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.198
But that doesn't make sense.

25:57.680 --> 26:01.639
Doesn't jibe with everything
I felt in the cockpit.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.510
Then why did you do it, Sully?

26:05.720 --> 26:07.472
What, land in the water?

26:08.480 --> 26:10.914
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could have done?

26:18.160 --> 26:20.674
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.910
The, uh, tuna basil
or the ham and cheddar?

26:25.080 --> 26:27.548
Tuna basil, Mr. Sully. Very fresh.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.071
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.196
Too cold today. Too much cold.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.709
When are you gonna come fly with me?
(GRUNTS)

26:37.920 --> 26:40.832

26:48.760 --> 26:50.432
- It's his birthday!
- Come on! No, Mom!

26:50.600 --> 26:52.033
Just a little something.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.400
The suitcase is already overstuffed
with gifts for Will.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.520
It's always fun to get
something from the airport.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.512
Feels like you've traveled, too.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.438
DIANE: Ma, he's turning one.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.353
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.919
But I will.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.957
Maybe a snow globe.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.634
Something he'll remember.
Something "New York."

27:09.800 --> 27:12.030
Were you this generous when we were kids?

27:12.200 --> 27:13.394
Okay, sweetheart.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.869
I'll get you a snow globe, too.

Hey, guys! Jeff!

27:44.600 --> 27:45.749
We're not gonna make it!

27:45.920 --> 27:47.216
I've been waiting for a year
for this trip, Dad.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.616
I'm not gonna miss this flight.
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

27:49.640 --> 27:51.280

28:25.440 --> 28:26.953

You could go pro.

Hey.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.878
Oh, I'm only teasing.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.160
The site does make it sound

30:18.320 --> 30:21.040
like your air safety consulting business
has got about 100 employees

30:21.080 --> 30:24.117
and headquarters in three states.

of being a bullshitter.

It's only seven miles.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.910
bound for Charlotte, North Carolina,

39:03.080 --> 39:04.911
and then a mid-air disaster

39:05.080 --> 39:08.277
struck US Airways Flight 1549.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.228
It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.109
The pilot quickly realized he could not
return to the airport and land.

His options severely limited,

you could. It was more than enough.

was still operating at idle.

for a successful return to LaGuardia.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.216
Although no one'll believe her.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.656
Hell, I'm standing here with you right now
and I don't believe it.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.496
You landed a plane on the Hudson.
Not a scratch on you.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.555
Arnie.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.758
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today, huh?

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.559
Talked to Dan Britt, Sully.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.954
Got a count.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.234
155.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.148
155.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.514
It's official.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.751
- 155.
- 155.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.319
(SIGHS) 155.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.558
Thank you, Arnie.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.271
- Hey, Carl.
- CARL: Jeff.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.793
- Sully.
- Carl.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.800
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.915
Well, we're here.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.957
It's about all I know at the moment.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.032
Oh, this is Ms. May, with the hotel.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.720
Wanted to have a quick word with you.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.160
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.456
This is only to say that my staff and I

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.856
are committed to protecting your privacy.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.394
So, if there's anything I can do at all...

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.711
If it's possible, I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.320
It's the only clothing that I have.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480
Dry-cleaning?

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.232
If it's too much... If it's too late...

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.549
Are you kidding?

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.593
Captain Sullenberger,
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.389
Oh, okay.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.590
Well, thank you, Evelyn.
Thank you very much.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.591
- Anything for Sully.
- Okay.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.159
Have a blessed day.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.953
What just happened?

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.350
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.273
Ah, come on, Sully.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.431
When's the last time you heard of someone

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.591
landing a jet plane on the water

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.439
and everybody lived?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.955
Exactly.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.115
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.277
And new clothes.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.836
What, did you think we were ninjas?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.672
Kmart was the only store open.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.136
It's Queens. It's 10:00 in the evening.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.628
- You find a Brooks Brothers.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.120
Sully.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.552
What are you even still doing in uniform?

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.552
Ah. You know, I don't know.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.315
Look, guys. It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.314
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.270
- Thank you, Carl.
- Yeah, thank you, Captain.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.474
It's been a while since
New York had news this good.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.640
Especially with an airplane in it.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.839
I'll see you later, Sully.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720
(DOOR SHUTS)

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.590
KRISTINE: The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing."

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.877
The perfect timing of the NYPD scuba units

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.071
and of the ferry boat captains,

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.392
and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.950
Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time,

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.350
became a man for all time.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.680
This is Kristine Johnson...

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840
The ti mi ng.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.680
...reporting live from the Hudson River.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.976
MALE NEWSCASTER: New York One Minute.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.136
The coast guard released this new video
of Flight 1549

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.116
making its emergency landing
on the Hudson.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.192
Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine of the aircraft.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.552
Hey, Sully. Let me...

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.119
Come on. Answer.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.915
Answer!

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.435
Larry, the CVR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.715
Sully?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.555
I know that Airbus has simulations
scheduled for the S22 sim at the factory.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.315
But that's next week in Toulouse.
Can you get them to reschedule?

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.754
It's 1:30 in the morning.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.040
I need you to make it happen

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.639
before we listen to the CVR.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.756
Before our testimony is complete.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.069
Why?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.638
I have a right to see the simulations
and I have a feeling that

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.156
with human pilots and not a computer,
the results are going to be different.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.754
What if they show the exact same result?

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.275
If they do,
then I'll hand you my wings myself.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.793
It's all about the timing, Larry.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.056
You can accomplish anything
if you're never in a hurry.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.832
I sure as hell agree with that.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.309
The CVR is on Wednesday. That's 36 hours.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.799
Can you make it happen?

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.599
I'll try.
It's a lot of phone calls to make.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.416
It's already 7:30
in the morning in France,

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.555
so you better get started.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.597
Thank you, Larry. Thank you.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.439
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.400
Hey, Lorrie.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.672
LORRIE: Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
before the hearing.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.274
Sweetheart, what happened?

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:45.271
I realized just now,
for the first time, that there were...

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.193
(VOICE BREAKING) There were 155 people
on that plane and you were one of them.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.437
We almost lost you.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.072
Yeah, but you didn't. I'm right here.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.472
How are you holding up?

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.193
Oh, I'm holding up.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.237
Please tell me this is almost over.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.318
It's almost over.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.515
Okay.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.795
I love you.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.359
I love you, too.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.710

- SKILES: Good morning, Sully.
- Jeff.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.536
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.709
My name is Charles Porter.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.559
I've been assigned by the
National Transportation Safety Board

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.069
to conduct this public hearing here today.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.152
We have a lot of material to cover.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.393
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.479
And we will be listening to it
for the first time

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.078
along with you, gentlemen.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.595
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union,

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.990
Airbus has agreed to link us via satellite

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.229
to today's piloted simulations.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.072
Upload link, please.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.600
(WHISPERS)
They're just simulations, Sully.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.990
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.398
Might change theirs.

All right. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.279
We have to return to the field.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.113
Okay. I'm gonna left turn
back to LaGuardia 1 -3.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.320

I'll activate the approach for you.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.353

sims bear the same result.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.992
We are simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.150
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.120
And frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.596
Can we get serious now?

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.435
Captain?

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.336
We've all heard about
the computer simulations

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.920
and now we are watching actual sims.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.230
But I can't quite believe

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.352
you still have not taken
into account the human factor.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.039
Human piloted simulations

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.160
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.794
No, they don't.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.119
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings,

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.788
like people who are experiencing this
for the first time.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.680
Well, they may not be reacting
like you did.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.352
Immediately after the bird strike

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.078
they are turning back for the airport.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.196
Just as in the computer sims, correct?

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360
That is correct.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.796
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.319
They did not run a check.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.833
They did not switch on the APU.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.275
They had all the same
parameters that you faced.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.078
No one warned us.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.033
No one said,
"You are going to lose both engines

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.839
"at a lower altitude
than any jet in history.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.629
"But be cool.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.155
"Just make a left turn for LaGuardia

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.595
"like you're going back

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.118

with 155 souls onboard.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.188
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that.

No one.

The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.235
we were not the Thunderbirds up there.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.216
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.310
before he actually pulled it off.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.192
I'm not questioning the pilots.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.793
They're good pilots.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.872
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.837

all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.553
How much time did the pilots
spend planning for this event?

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.278
For these simulations?

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.115

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.270
This wasn't a video game.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.192
It was life and death.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.910
Sully's right. That's worth a few seconds.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.514

practice runs they had.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.558

had 17 practice attempts

What did you think?

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.359
Hearing the CVR just now?

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.671
Let me tell you what I think.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.312
I'm just so damn proud.

And you, you were right there,
through all that distraction.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.871
With so much at stake.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.868
We did this together. We were a team.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.074
Thanks, Sully.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.596

Hey, you did good.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.240
All right, folks.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.896
I'd like to call this hearing
back to order.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.592
If we could settle, please.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.073
Take your seats.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.916
That is honestly the first time

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.911
that I have listened to a crash recording

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.592
while actually sitting

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.398
with the captain and the first officer.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.673
It's extraordinary.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.714
That was no simulation.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.113
No, it wasn't.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.988
Gentlemen,

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.269
I want to inform you that
the left engine has been recovered.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.595
We just received a comprehensive report.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.952
There was extensive damage

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.588
to both the guide vanes
and fan blades of the engine.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:42.558
Five compressor blades were fractured

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.793
and eight variable guide vanes missing.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.197
So, no thrust?

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.429
As you testified,

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.270
it was completely destroyed.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.635
The ACARS data was wrong.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.278
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.757
I can say with absolute confidence

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.912
that after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew,

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.274
with bird experts, aviation engineers,

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.279
after running through every scenario,

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.670
after interviewing each player,

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.594
there is still an "X" in this result

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.153
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.314
Remove you from the equation,
and the math just fails.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.752
I disagree.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.153
It wasn't just me. It was all of us.

We all did it.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.510
We survived.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.033
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.636
Anything you would have done differently

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.478
if you had to do it again?

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.714
Yes.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.958
I would have done it in July.

but the other faces,
