into debts studying music

06:19.880 --> 06:22.481
when I could just perform?"

06:22.583 --> 06:25.083

to Nashville in the first place,

06:25.219 --> 06:27.819
not to go to school.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.155
How's that panning out for you?

Well, without student aid, I ran
out of money pretty quickly.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.763
Turns out, street performing
isn't super lucrative,

06:37.831 --> 06:41.299

with mom and dad.

I don't need to be reminded

I am.

I'm okay.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.786
It's been three years
and every day gets easier.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.022
But being here
reminds me so much of James.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.092
He always loved
all of our Christmas traditions.

to spot you?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.214

08:36.316 --> 08:38.482

You know, when I heard this
order, I knew it had to be you.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.304
You haven't changed
since high school.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.272
This is
a perfectly reasonable order.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.042
It's a soy-latte with whipped
cream. It makes no sense.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.944
I don't have to explain myself

It's nice to see you, too,

09:46.486 --> 09:48.753
Likewise.

So I'm just going to wait here

- If you wanna...

09:55.729 --> 09:56.928
Mm-hmm.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.000
How long has it been?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.735
Hm. Hundred years, give or take.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.571
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
- [woman 1] Got a peppermint...

10:06.673 --> 10:09.441
So, um, what brings you to town?

10:09.476 --> 10:12.277
I thought you were spending
Christmas in LA these days.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.513
Well, mom and dad are spending
the sunny Christmas back home,

10:15.582 --> 10:17.949
but they're gonna have
to make do without me this year.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.119
- Oh, poor them.
- Or lucky you.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.924
Actually, I moved back.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.159
Been here a few months now.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.894
Really?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.163
Why is it so hard for you
to believe?

10:32.265 --> 10:33.565
Are you kidding me?

10:33.700 --> 10:35.133
You couldn't wait to get to USC

10:35.268 --> 10:37.736
and out
of tiny little Woodstock.

10:37.838 --> 10:42.440
True, but, um... things change.

10:42.476 --> 10:46.111
Now I see the appeals
of a great, little family town.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.880
- Yes, it is.
- Um...

10:51.351 --> 10:55.120
I'm sorry about James.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.722
My parents told me
about the accident and...

10:57.791 --> 11:00.425
Yeah, I should have called.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.060
It's okay.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.332
Well, actually, um,
I was gonna look you up.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.535
Uh, I have something
I need to talk to you about.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.704
- Really?
- I just got a text from mom.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.272
Bethany and George
are at the house.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.408
They're gonna start cooking.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.976
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.045
You guys still do
the Christmas cook-off?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.179
Yup.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.059
Leave it to your family
to take a holiday feast

11:23.083 --> 11:25.517
and turn it into a competition.

11:25.619 --> 11:27.752
Are you hoping for an invite?

11:27.788 --> 11:31.289
Oh, uh, well, I-I could never
say no to your cooking...

11:31.391 --> 11:34.759
- Always a pleasure, Nash.
- Sorry, got to run.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.430
Nash, it's been, well,
it's been just like high school.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.200
Is that a good thing?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.668
Jury's still out.

11:43.770 --> 11:47.072
[instrumental music]

11:48.208 --> 11:51.476
- [grunts] There.
- And that looks yummy.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.112
[Peggy]
Oh, it's a good one this year.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.916
Oh, honey, look at that.
Looks delicious.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.185
Don't you think it's a little
unfair to have a cook-off

12:00.220 --> 12:04.022
as a family tradition with Megan
being a professional chef?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.825
It started
as a way to share new recipes.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.862
It's not supposed to be
a competition.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.499
- Tell that to Bethany.
- Hey!

12:14.601 --> 12:16.601
How am I supposed to compete
with pie?

12:16.636 --> 12:18.203
In what world
are mashed potatoes

12:18.305 --> 12:19.771
more delicious than pie?

12:19.873 --> 12:20.638
She's right.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.140
Audrey doesn't stand a chance

12:22.175 --> 12:23.575
against this.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.243
Any dish is fair game.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.213
Remember the year
dad won with a salad?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.281
You just have to think
like a chef.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.683
Add some pizzazz.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.018
Speaking of which,
how's work, Megan?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.221
You still liking the restaurant?

12:36.289 --> 12:39.624
It's steady.
I love running the kitchen.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.826
I just wish
I could run the menu, too.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.129
Her boss is hopeless.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.296
That's what mom says.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.465
[laughing]

12:47.501 --> 12:49.734
Yeah, the owner is a bit much.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.469
You should open your own place.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.472
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to start a restaurant?

12:54.574 --> 12:56.307
Bethany's right.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.110
There is no way
I'm ready for that.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.546
And the most important thing

13:01.581 --> 13:03.882
is that we're happy in Austin.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.918
[Daniel] Oh, Megan,
that is outstanding!

13:06.987 --> 13:10.822
[Bethany] Wow, Megan.
[Ivy] Mm, looks good, mom.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.056
So unfair.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.693
That's it. I surrender.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.997
This has got to be the best
holiday cook-off we've had yet.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.799
Way to go, Marvins.

13:20.901 --> 13:25.503
And I think we all agree on
our surprise winner this year.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.038
[Megan] Hm.
[Audrey] Called it.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.518
I couldn't have done it
without grandma.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.774
- Could I?
- Oh.

13:29.810 --> 13:33.144
I think the prize
is all yours, Ivy.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.046
To the successful beginning

13:35.081 --> 13:36.915
of our family
Christmas celebration.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.316
May the next two weeks be full

13:38.351 --> 13:40.318
of joy, love and warmth,

13:40.420 --> 13:43.054
and lead to the best Christmas
we've ever had.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.626
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Merry Christmas.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.698
Mm. Thank you, Daniel.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.134
I think
that's an appropriate segue

13:56.269 --> 13:59.037
into delivering our news.

13:59.105 --> 14:03.107
- Ooh, what could it be?
- Right.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.744
Kids, uh, as you know,
I've been planning to retire

14:06.780 --> 14:08.446
for quite some time now

14:08.515 --> 14:10.648
and this year
I'm finally doing it.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.717
- Oh, great, dad. Oh.
- [Megan] Congratulations.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.385
- Congratulations.
- [Daniel] Thank you.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.522
I've had a good run, 37 years.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.991
George,
you'll get there someday.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.126
[all laughing]

14:22.229 --> 14:24.329
At least I'm teaching college,
I can't imagine

14:24.397 --> 14:26.497
teaching Earth Science
at high schools for that long.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.301
Honestly, it had its faults,
but it rocked.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.936
- [Peggy] Hm.
- Oh, no, dad.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.805
[all laughing]

14:33.907 --> 14:36.207
And with my retirement,

14:36.243 --> 14:37.620
your mother and I
are ready to move on

14:37.644 --> 14:39.143
to the next stage of our lives.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.445
Oh.

14:41.681 --> 14:45.884
Well, what your father's
trying to say is...

14:47.053 --> 14:49.187
we're selling the house.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.824
What?

14:52.859 --> 14:54.392
Mom, you can't be serious.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.461
We grew up in this house,
I guess.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.663
That's too expensive
for just your mother and me.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.231
And, of course,
we always thought

15:00.300 --> 15:02.333
the house would stay
in the family.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.235
But then Bethany moved
to Philadelphia

15:04.304 --> 15:07.639
and Megan to Austin.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.041
You all started your own lives.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.710
But if you move, where would we
celebrate Christmas?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.078
Exactly!

15:14.114 --> 15:15.580
This is the one place
we actually

15:15.649 --> 15:16.681
get to see each other.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.483
You can't just sell it.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.020
I... Where are we,
y-you going to live?

15:22.088 --> 15:26.591
We already have a condo in mind.
We've given a deposit.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.394
When we sell the house,
we'll have enough to retire.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.662
You kids will love it.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.431
It's a cute, little community

15:33.466 --> 15:35.166
just outside Sedona.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.434
Arizona?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.803
Imagine living that close
to the Grand Canyon.

15:38.838 --> 15:42.840
And I'm thinking
of all those desert landscapes

15:42.876 --> 15:44.208
waiting to be photographed.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.277
Mm. That's great, mom.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.112
You guys are gonna love it.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.548
Guys, let's not lose focus here.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.417
They're selling the house.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.387
Megan, you have to be with me
on this one.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.223
We do have
a lot of great memories here

15:59.359 --> 16:02.660
and we'll make plenty more
wherever we celebrate Christmas.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.830
I'm happy for you, dad.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.232
You deserve to retire.

16:08.301 --> 16:12.070
I know this is sudden,
but things are moving fast.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.739
We have some buyers coming
to the house in the morning.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.140
In the morning?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.913
We'll have to make
our last Christmas here

16:22.015 --> 16:24.015
that much more special.

16:27.454 --> 16:31.422
So was Bethany really okay
with our plan?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.625
She thinks it's a smart decision
and so do I.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.030
Your turn.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.632
Here you go, flatter side down,

16:41.735 --> 16:44.002
eyes on the top
where you wanna strike.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.539
You got that?

16:53.279 --> 16:55.380
[grunts] Oh.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.282
Well, that's a start.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.385
I'm gonna go check on the girls.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.521
[instrumental music]

17:07.694 --> 17:12.630
So now you bring this stitch
back that way.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.266
There you go. That's it.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.468
- Great.
- Good.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.804
Look at you.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.241
- How's our lumberjack?
- I have an apprentice.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.309
[all laughing]

17:30.283 --> 17:32.350
- Oh, Peggy?
- Hm?

17:40.693 --> 17:41.904
[chuckles]
Good morning, Daniel.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.428
Good morning, Lane.
Please come in.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.829
Thank you.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.536
Everyone,
I'd like you to meet Lane.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.837
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.506
Lane Castle.
Archer Real Estate.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.309
- Wonderful to meet you.
- You're the real-estate agent?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.878
Yes, but in this particular
instance,

18:00.947 --> 18:04.582
I'll be handling the transaction
for myself.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.551
I never pass up
on a good investment property.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.886
- Huh?
- So I thought I'd make an offer.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.756
- Well, me and my partner.
- Partner?

18:11.858 --> 18:14.125
Yes, he is covering
half the purchase.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.626
He's been doing work
as a contractor

18:15.728 --> 18:16.994
on some of my properties

18:17.130 --> 18:18.641
these past few months,
and when I learned

18:18.665 --> 18:21.099
he was also looking
for an investment property,

18:21.167 --> 18:22.767
we decided to team up.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.135
Will he be joining us?

18:24.237 --> 18:25.636
I spoke to him on the way over.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.105
He should be here any minute.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.473
Would you like some coffee?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.741
Sure. Oh.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.845
Oh, there he is now.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.215
Are you going to live here?

18:37.317 --> 18:40.118
Oh, I don't think so. [chuckles]

18:40.153 --> 18:42.120
Well, hi there.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.655
Hi, Mr. Marvin.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.257
Nash?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.060
Why, it's been ages.

18:49.095 --> 18:52.196
- I heard you'd moved back.
- [Lane] Hey.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.298
You k-know each other?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.802
Megan and Nash were close
all through high school.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.571
He was over here
almost every day.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.007
Oh? Well, then you must be

19:03.042 --> 19:05.443
pretty familiar
with the property.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.379
Um, it's great
to see you all again.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.515
It's been way too long.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.985
Wait. You're buying our house?

19:15.221 --> 19:19.023
Yeah. Well, I mean,
we're buying it.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.026
Why didn't you mention this
yesterday?

19:22.128 --> 19:25.096
I'm sorry. I tried to, but...

19:25.165 --> 19:28.466
- [Nash] Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.235
But, I mean, it is
a little weird, though, right?

19:31.371 --> 19:32.770
Well, yeah.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.340
Well, why don't we talk
in the kitchen?

19:36.442 --> 19:38.509
Lane, let's get you that coffee.

19:38.578 --> 19:42.213
- And a cup for you, Nash?
- I think that's a great idea.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.383
- Nash?
- Yeah, sure.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.218
It was wonderful
meeting you all.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.686
Nice to meet you.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.257
I'm sorry.
We'll talk about this later?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.659
Yeah.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.135
Sibling meeting. The attic.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.470
Now.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.607
[instrumental music]

20:11.177 --> 20:12.710
Sorry, dad.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.899
We are not gonna
let this happen.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.157
- Audrey.
- This is where we grew up.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.803
Are you really gonna let
your ex-boyfriend

20:27.827 --> 20:29.293
do who-knows-what with it?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.762
If I had to say,
yes, he's, he's flipping it.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.531
Audrey,
this is none of our business.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.133
If mom and dad wanna sell,
let them sell.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.702
What about Christmas?

20:37.804 --> 20:40.238
Megan, you used to live
for all our family traditions.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.907
You were, like,
the Christmas police.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.809
What'll happen
once the house is gone?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.011
We can always make
new traditions.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.681
It's just a house. We can meet
somewhere else for Christmas.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.650
Our place in Philadelphia
is perfect

20:52.685 --> 20:55.786
for hosting family functions.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.121
And, actually...

20:57.223 --> 20:59.457
We all know this is about
more than just a house.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.592
Megan, back me up here.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.160
I understand what you're saying.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.364
Remember, I have ten years
on you in this house.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.166
- So I know how special it is.
- Thank you.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.802
So if this
is our last Christmas here,

21:11.871 --> 21:15.439
we should be making it
as memorable as possible,

21:15.508 --> 21:17.441
doing all the things
that make it so special.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.477
Yeah, like chopping down
the tree?

21:19.545 --> 21:21.812
Exactly, we are going to do

21:21.914 --> 21:24.181
all of our Christmas traditions
to the fullest.

21:24.250 --> 21:29.153
Like, finding a tree and
making ornaments, the snowman.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.222
Donating toys,
decorating cookies.

21:31.324 --> 21:35.760
Making gingerbread houses
and the Christmas firework tour.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.828
Of course, how could we forget?

21:37.864 --> 21:41.932
- So we say goodbye properly.
- I don't believe this.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.302
Megan, I thought, of all people,
you'd understand.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.104
You got married
in our living room.

21:47.206 --> 21:51.709
Can you really let it go
so easily?

21:51.778 --> 21:53.110
Well,
I'm not gonna let it happen.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.723
And what exactly
are you gonna do to stop it?

21:54.747 --> 21:57.348
- I'll think of something.
- Audrey, come on!

21:57.383 --> 21:59.750
Can we try to be a little more
mature about this?

21:59.819 --> 22:02.620
- You can all do what you want.
- Audrey!

22:07.860 --> 22:09.727
That could have gone better.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.330
[knocking on door]

22:12.365 --> 22:14.198
I got it, mom!

22:16.502 --> 22:18.769
- Hi, Brandon.
- Morning, neighbor. What's up?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.639
How do you feel about helping me
save my house?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.021
[Audrey] By the way, I'm glad
you're on semester break.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.045
Okay...

22:27.146 --> 22:28.779
[instrumental music]

22:30.650 --> 22:32.350
[Lane] I just wanna be sure.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.219
We're putting up a lot
in earnest money.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.121
And we can kiss
that deposit goodbye

22:37.223 --> 22:38.823
if you simply get cold feet.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.392
[chuckles]
I won't get cold feet.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.227
I do this for a living,
you know?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.540
Besides,
you're reading into things.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.464
Megan and I dated ages ago.

22:46.532 --> 22:50.034
Yes, you did, which is why
I find it interesting

22:50.103 --> 22:53.237
that you're going all in
on this property in particular.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.905
It's a good house.

22:55.007 --> 22:59.009
Look, would I take a risk
if I had any reservations?

23:00.313 --> 23:02.313
Trust me, things are more than
under control.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.815
In fact, I'm heading over there
tomorrow to oversee

23:04.851 --> 23:08.786
the home inspection and I'm not
even thinking about her.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.623
If you say so.
We need to be a team on this.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.092
I can't afford this deal
without you, Nash.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.629
Yes, I say so.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.731
You've nothing to worry about.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.466
Now, if you'll excuse me.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.538
Nash?

23:27.607 --> 23:30.674
I'm all for reconnecting
with old flames.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.376
Just try not to ruin

23:32.412 --> 23:35.379
a perfectly good
real-estate deal in the process.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.115
I won't. [sighs]

23:38.151 --> 23:40.885
I just hope that Megan can
withstand my natural charm

23:40.953 --> 23:42.353
through all this.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.457
Bye, Lane.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.593
[instrumental music]

23:52.098 --> 23:54.098
[Bethany] Do you know
that this train has been here

23:54.133 --> 23:56.100
since I was your age?

23:56.135 --> 23:58.369
- Really?
- It really has been.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.471
It's awesome.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.705
They put it out every Christmas.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.009
[indistinct chatter]

24:08.848 --> 24:11.649
I'm just picking
wrapping paper, mom.

24:11.751 --> 24:16.754
I know, but it might be the last
time in your favorite toy store.

24:16.823 --> 24:20.191
They've had that same train
setup since I was Ivy's age.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.392
[indistinct chatter]

24:21.494 --> 24:23.727
Ah, I love this place.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.897
Ah.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.702
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about

24:31.771 --> 24:33.337
what happened this morning.

24:34.474 --> 24:38.476
- Are you all right?
- Mm. I am fine.

24:38.578 --> 24:41.078
And you didn't know it was gonna
be Nash any more than I did.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.547
I know, but still...

24:45.017 --> 24:46.617
Don't worry, mom.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.089
Hey, can you buy this, too, dad?

24:52.158 --> 24:53.924
- Of course.
- Oh, thank you.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.460
[laughing] That is quite
the donation this year...

24:56.562 --> 24:58.095
And we're not done.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.931
Ivy still has a few gifts
to pick out.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.666
Come on, let's help her decide.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.735
[woman 1]
I'll hold on to these.

25:07.373 --> 25:10.407
[gasps]
Remember those?

25:10.510 --> 25:13.477
You and Bethany
had the entire set.

25:13.546 --> 25:17.181
Right. So where are they now?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.617
Tsk.
Probably under Audrey's bed.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.154
Oh. I'm really
going to miss it here.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.325
They do have toy stores
in Arizona, mom.

25:28.361 --> 25:31.295
I know, but...

25:31.330 --> 25:33.697
I guess, part of me always
imagined Ivy coming here

25:33.766 --> 25:37.701
with her children, too.
I know it's silly.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.804
I am excited to move and start a
new adventure with your father,

25:40.873 --> 25:45.442
but Woodstock will always hold
a special place in my heart.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.611
It will for all of us.

25:49.949 --> 25:53.117
I don't know. Doesn't that seem
kind of dishonest?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.685
How is it dishonest?

25:54.787 --> 25:57.655
If anything,
it's the right thing to do.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.690
We're pointing out
the house's problems.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.125
With a few embellishments

26:01.227 --> 26:02.960
to convince them
not to go through with it.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.628
What, it's not like
it's against the law

26:04.730 --> 26:05.774
to bend the truth a little.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.765
It's called perjury.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.033
Isn't Bethany a lawyer?

26:09.101 --> 26:11.168
How did none of that
rub off on you?

26:11.237 --> 26:13.938
I don't know. [laughs]

26:14.006 --> 26:17.007
Okay. Uh... How do your sisters
feel about this?

26:17.109 --> 26:20.978
They're both in denial.
Well, at least Megan is.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.547
But trust me,
this is for the best.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.050
I'm just buying a little time
for my parents to see

26:26.152 --> 26:29.019
how important it is
to keep the house.

26:29.121 --> 26:33.023
I mean, if you really want me
to move away...

26:33.159 --> 26:36.293
[inhales sharply]
Okay. Fine.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.429
I'll help. But you owe me.

26:38.531 --> 26:40.297
Good...

26:40.366 --> 26:43.334
because the home inspector
is coming by tomorrow.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.107
[knocking on door]

26:50.176 --> 26:51.909
[door creaking]

26:52.011 --> 26:53.477
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey, Brandon.

26:53.579 --> 26:56.013
- Hey.
- It's good to see you.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.782
What are you guys up to?

26:58.851 --> 27:00.451
- Nothing!
- Uh, we're...

27:00.553 --> 27:02.019
- Just catching up.
- [clears throat]

27:02.121 --> 27:06.056
Well... Well, I'm just waiting
for the home inspector.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.325
- He should be here any minute.
- Oh.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.261
- Wow. What a coincidence.
- Hm.

27:11.364 --> 27:13.297
Oh, there he is now.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.402
[instrumental music]

27:25.578 --> 27:28.846
- What's he doing here?
- Aha!

27:28.948 --> 27:32.149
Would you look at that?

27:32.284 --> 27:36.520
Looks like he wanted
to oversee the inspection.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.790
Unless he's interested
in more than just the house.

27:42.228 --> 27:45.929
If you'd like, Brandon and I
can show the inspector around.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.798
Give you some more time
with Nash.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.067
Don't be ridiculous.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.976
- Well, hi there.
- Hey.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.412
I didn't know
you'd be here today.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.180
Well, I figured I should be here

28:03.249 --> 28:04.615
in case something serious
pops up.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.151
This is Randy,
he'll be doing the inspection.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.120
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.922
I guess I should be
getting used to the fact

28:12.024 --> 28:13.991
that we'll be seeing more
of each other.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.093
I will let you two get to it.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.797
Yeah, actually, um,
do you mind tagging along?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.432
I thought it might be helpful,

28:21.467 --> 28:25.703
just in case Randy needs
any details that I don't have.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.905
Uh, Brandon and I can help.

28:27.940 --> 28:32.843
In fact,
why don't you two catch up?

28:32.945 --> 28:36.447
And if we need you,
we'll, we'll come find you.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.151
I do have some sugar cookies
to bake.

28:41.187 --> 28:44.455
[instrumental music]

28:51.430 --> 28:53.597
Is that your brother-in-law?

28:53.699 --> 28:55.632
Yeah. George.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.735
Dad says he's improving.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.608
So fill me in.

29:04.677 --> 29:07.711
You're buying old houses
and flipping them now?

29:07.813 --> 29:10.781
Well, only houses that I know
other people are gonna love.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.784
Houses with history
and character.

29:13.853 --> 29:17.221
I mean,
who wouldn't wanna live here?

29:17.289 --> 29:19.490
Well, you used to not want to.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.959
Last time I saw you,
you were racing off to LA.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.694
Hey, that was for school.

29:23.729 --> 29:27.631
And my family moved
and my dad opened his new firm

29:27.700 --> 29:31.702
in Southern California
and, on paper, it was perfect.

29:31.737 --> 29:34.605
Then I graduated,
got a job at the firm

29:34.673 --> 29:37.374
and it turned out that I didn't
want to be an architect

29:37.476 --> 29:39.243
as much as he wanted me to be.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.178
- Yeah, sure.
- Hm.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.046
But I-I always did love
renovating.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.016
So I figured
why not make it a living.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.619
Well, how's it going?

29:48.654 --> 29:51.288
Honestly? I love it.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.023
There's nothing like
taking something old

29:53.058 --> 29:56.360
and transforming it while
keeping its original essence.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.861
[oven alarm beeps]

29:59.765 --> 30:04.301
And I couldn't see my future
in Southern California, so...

30:05.571 --> 30:08.505
a few months ago I moved back.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.407
Just like that?

30:10.476 --> 30:13.010
Well, it's Vermont, well,
they do things different here

30:13.078 --> 30:14.511
and I've had to adjust,

30:14.613 --> 30:17.548
but, you know, it's been
a little more challenging

30:17.583 --> 30:18.882
than I thought it would be.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.051
Oh, is that why
you started working

30:21.086 --> 30:23.720
with Ms. Castle...

30:23.823 --> 30:27.958
Lane. Well, pretty much.
It's a, it's a big step.

30:29.695 --> 30:32.830
Hey, uh-uh,
those are for l-later.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.298
Hm... Mm.

30:34.366 --> 30:38.502
Oh, my gosh,
I forgot how good these are.

30:38.571 --> 30:43.407
It's amazin' how that can
bring you back in time.

30:43.475 --> 30:46.610
Oh, yeah.
Remembering anything good?

30:47.646 --> 30:50.981
Yeah. All of it. Every second.

30:56.722 --> 31:00.958
I-I wonder how Randy is doing
with Audrey and Brandon.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.294
Oh, I'm sure they're taking
great care of him.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.631
[instrumental music]

31:11.337 --> 31:14.037
D'you remember when we were kids
and I fell through the floor

31:14.106 --> 31:15.606
while helping find
Christmas lights?

31:15.641 --> 31:18.275
Oh, yeah,
you know, I think my dad

31:18.344 --> 31:20.143
said something about termites.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.146
- Hm. Yeah.
- Naughty little guys.

31:25.451 --> 31:29.052
Yeah, my dad's been meaning
to fix that.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.094
[clattering]

31:37.162 --> 31:38.195
Careful.

31:38.330 --> 31:42.299
That fuse box is, uh,
temperamental.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.268
I myself have been electrocuted
three times

31:44.403 --> 31:46.370
right where you're standing.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.242
Okay, I'm sorry.
But what is this?

31:52.311 --> 31:56.079
That is a sleigh.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.814
Obviously.

31:57.850 --> 32:00.350
Ivy, do we have a ruling?

32:00.419 --> 32:02.519
Sorry. Reject pile.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.254
- Oh...
- That's cruel.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.123
Nash, you might be
even worse at this

32:06.191 --> 32:07.269
than you were in high school.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.492
Now, that's impossible.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.560
- [chuckles]
- [knocking on door]

32:10.629 --> 32:11.828
Hey.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.499
Is everything okay?

32:15.601 --> 32:17.401
I'll have my report to you
tomorrow.

32:17.503 --> 32:20.637
Just, it's gonna be
a long report.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.206
- Huh.
- What happened?

32:23.275 --> 32:26.410
Nothing.
We were just very thorough.

32:26.445 --> 32:30.948
Huh. Ah, well, I gotta take off,
too, actually...

32:30.983 --> 32:32.616
You're not going to come
caroling?

32:32.685 --> 32:35.285
We're going to town
to sing on Main Street.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.587
Wow! You guys still do that?

32:37.656 --> 32:40.190
- Yeah, of course, we do.
- [Peggy] The whole town does.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.125
We'd love for you to come.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.095
You're not sick of me yet?

32:45.164 --> 32:47.664
Oh, I can't speak
for the whole family.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.299
[all laughing]

32:49.435 --> 32:50.801
But, yeah, you should come.

caroling happens in Woodstock.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.820
[chuckles]

33:43.889 --> 33:47.657
I, um, wanted to say,
your voice is amazing.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.226
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:49.261 --> 33:53.330
I mean, I knew you were good
when you left. But now?

33:53.399 --> 33:57.434
I'm surprised they let you drop
out with a voice that good.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.037
You should share it
with more people.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.638
I'll think about it.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.576
So good-goodnight.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.844
Night.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.817
Even rejects taste good.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.119
They sure do.

34:19.257 --> 34:23.627
So, uh, thank you again
for today. [chuckles]

34:23.762 --> 34:25.161
It's our pleasure.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.864
- Bye.
- See you around.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.768
- Definitely.
- Hey, Nash.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.335
What are you doing tomorrow?

34:33.371 --> 34:36.339
Oh, I-I have a few errands
to run in the morning,

34:36.408 --> 34:38.909
but I'm free in the afternoon.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.110
[Daniel] Great.
Why don't you stop by again?

34:41.179 --> 34:43.847
You can help us with another
Marvin family tradition.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.382
- We're overdue for a tree.
- Yeah.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.150
Where else are we gonna put
all the presents?

34:48.187 --> 34:50.454
- It'd be great.
- Okay.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.989
Well, I guess
I'll see you all tomorrow.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.260
- [Ivy] Yeah.
- [chuckles] I'll walk you out.

35:00.999 --> 35:04.801
Well, Megan and Nash seem to be
getting along pretty well.

35:04.903 --> 35:09.806
Yes, they do. I haven't seen
Megan this happy in years.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.853
Is that why you invited Nash
to come over tomorrow?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.911
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:16.115 --> 35:19.182
[Umental music]

35:23.956 --> 35:26.623
- And what about this one?
- [Ivy] No.

35:26.725 --> 35:27.924
[Audrey chuckles]

35:27.960 --> 35:29.893
- Hey.
- Hey. [laughs]

35:29.928 --> 35:34.197
- Is this good?
- I think there's a better one.

35:34.266 --> 35:37.901
[exhales] Yeah. I forgot
how committed your family is.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.069
What do you mean?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.448
Where else
are you supposed to find

35:40.472 --> 35:41.738
the perfect tree?

35:41.773 --> 35:43.974
Oh, I remember my first time
doing this

35:44.009 --> 35:46.910
with your family, vividly.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.044
We just started dating

35:48.180 --> 35:49.913
and your dad was walking me out

35:49.948 --> 35:51.348
into the middle of the woods

35:51.383 --> 35:53.250
carrying a giant saw.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.352
- [laughing]
- Mom, catch up.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.554
We'll never get a tree
walking this slow.

35:57.623 --> 35:58.623
[Megan] We're coming.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.990
I'm glad you got to,

36:00.058 --> 36:02.325
you get to share this tradition
with Ivy.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.994
- Yeah.
- [clears throat]

36:04.062 --> 36:07.864
Cutting down the tree up here's
one of her favorite things.

36:07.900 --> 36:11.034
You know, uh, I never asked.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.637
Why did you guys move?

36:13.772 --> 36:16.239
James landed his dream job
in Austin,

36:16.275 --> 36:19.409
and I knew I'd have more
opportunities to cook out there.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.145
It was the best move for us,
for Ivy.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.950
It's kind of ironic.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.652
I mean, we broke up
because I wanted

36:28.687 --> 36:31.221
to get out of this town
and you wanted to stay.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.558
And now I've moved back
and you're the one who left.

36:34.593 --> 36:38.428
No, no, no, you're the one
who broke up with me.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.065
- Regardless.
- [laughs]

36:42.167 --> 36:44.868
I'm glad I get to spend
one last Christmas with you.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.807
Ah. That's it.

36:53.745 --> 36:54.811
- This one?
- Mm-hmm.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.846
It looks like it's big enough.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.448
- Dad?
- Yup.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.417
The only feeling

37:00.519 --> 37:02.786
better than finding
the perfect tree

37:02.821 --> 37:04.154
is cutting it down.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.356
[laughing]

37:08.393 --> 37:10.126
Are you serious?

37:10.262 --> 37:13.597
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna be honest.
I always wanted to do this.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.266
[laughs]
You know, though, I, uh,

37:16.401 --> 37:19.402
I think I'm gonna need
some help, somebody strong.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.505
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Yeah.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.107
Come here.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.813
All right. [sighs]

37:29.848 --> 37:31.081
There.

37:31.183 --> 37:32.582
[indistinct chatter]

37:32.651 --> 37:35.885
God job. Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.665
Keep it straight.
All right, uh, there we go.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.722
- All right.
- [cheering]

37:38.857 --> 37:40.523
- Yay!
- [Peggy] Good job.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.158
[Nash] Yahoo! All right.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.294
[instrumental music]

37:44.329 --> 37:46.529
- Watch your step, guys.
- I got it.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.233
- Got it?
- Yup.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.437
So what's the deal with Nash?

37:56.642 --> 37:59.242
I know you don't like to talk
about this kind of thing,

37:59.311 --> 38:03.780
but we all noticed how you were
looking at him earlier.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.149
Bethany, we broke up
many years ago.

38:06.251 --> 38:10.120
- There's nothing going on.
- Really?

38:10.155 --> 38:12.055
Yes, he's still cute

38:12.190 --> 38:15.225
and always knows
how to make me smile,

38:15.327 --> 38:16.493
but don't misinterpret that.

38:16.561 --> 38:20.030
We're just reconnecting
as friends.

38:20.065 --> 38:24.000
- I don't want anything more.
- Why not?

38:24.069 --> 38:27.671
When James and I met in college,
it was love at first sight.

38:27.739 --> 38:31.408
We were partners in everything.
Well, you know how that feels.

38:31.510 --> 38:35.512
You and George, in your way,
are so close.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.548
Imagine losing that.

38:40.152 --> 38:44.821
Well, I need to be here for Ivy,
she's my focus now.

38:44.923 --> 38:47.924
I know you haven't so much
as looked at another guy

38:47.959 --> 38:50.393
in three years.

38:50.429 --> 38:54.197
I will always be here for you
to lean on.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.132
But if you ever want
something more,

38:56.168 --> 38:58.435
you shouldn't feel guilty
about it.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.871
Thanks, sis.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.473
- All right, come around.
- Okay.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.675
[Daniel and Brandon]
Ready? One, two, three.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.143
[Daniel]
And up!

39:08.814 --> 39:11.081
- All right. How's that?
- All right.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.416
- Uh, a little to the left.
- My left or your left?

39:13.518 --> 39:16.353
- Right there?
- [George] Oh, sorry.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.088
- How's it look?
- Is that good?

39:18.123 --> 39:19.956
- [Brandon] Good?
- Perfect.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.492
- [George] Great.
- Thanks, boys.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.962
- [sighs] Good job, sir.
- Hey, thanks.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.466
Hey, Audrey, uh,
thanks for letting me tag along.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.769
My family firmly falls
into the tree-like category.

39:34.339 --> 39:36.005
Yeah, it was really fun
last night.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.307
Yeah, it was.

39:37.342 --> 39:40.877
So, uh, any updates
on the house?

39:40.946 --> 39:44.614
No word on the inspection report
yet, but I can't say

39:44.649 --> 39:47.417
that Nash hanging around so much
is a good sign.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.686
...California...

39:49.721 --> 39:52.122
At least he seems to be making
your sister happy.

39:52.157 --> 39:56.092
Yeah.
I think he's pretty happy, too.

39:56.128 --> 39:57.605
And it's definitely
not just the house

39:57.629 --> 39:59.662
that keeps bringing him back.

40:01.466 --> 40:04.334
I just wish it didn't mean
losing the house.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.009
[Ivy] I'm ready
for my early Christmas present.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.878
Close your eyes.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.346
Hold out your hands.

40:18.316 --> 40:19.783
- Guess.
- A rock?

40:19.885 --> 40:23.119
It's a geode, and I promise you
there's a surprise inside,

40:23.155 --> 40:26.122
but you have to wait
for Christmas to open it.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.557
Thank you.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.430
What you doin'?

40:33.465 --> 40:34.831
Everyone's deciding if they have

40:34.866 --> 40:37.634
the energy to decorate tonight.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.169
[Megan] We can't
decorate the tree.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.271
We haven't made
the ornaments yet.

40:41.306 --> 40:45.408
Hm, we can just use
the ones we have.

40:45.477 --> 40:46.609
Mom.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.979
[chuckles] Oh, honey.
You're so cute.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.715
Of course, we'll make them.

40:52.784 --> 40:56.219
I'll go check it up.
All right.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.423
Hey.

41:00.459 --> 41:05.361
Hey. I just wanted to say
goodbye before heading out.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.797
[chuckles] I had
a really good time today.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.733
- Yeah. Me, too.
- And I heard from Randy.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.203
He sent over
the inspection reports.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.271
Turns out
that there is a lot of things

41:15.407 --> 41:17.006
that need fixing in this house.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.189
And I know you guys have plenty
of Christmas celebrating to do,

41:21.213 --> 41:22.812
so if it's not too much
of a nuisance,

41:22.914 --> 41:24.481
I could come over
in the next few days

41:24.516 --> 41:27.083
for some DIY.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.419
Are you sure you aren't using
this whole DIY thing

41:29.454 --> 41:32.722
as an excuse to muscle
into my family Christmas?

41:32.824 --> 41:35.325
Oh, wow. Yeah, I'm...

41:35.360 --> 41:36.726
- Yeah, I'm hurt.
- [chuckles]

41:36.828 --> 41:38.862
What an accusation.
I would never do that.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.864
[laughs]

41:40.899 --> 41:45.969
[sighs] Well, it is the most
wonderful time of the year.

41:46.004 --> 41:49.839
- So is that a yes?
- I'll run it by my parents.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.908
Cool. They already said yes.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.515
[laughs] Oh!

41:58.617 --> 42:01.784
Okay. We can both
sleep in this bed tonight.

42:04.489 --> 42:05.855
Did you have fun today?

42:05.957 --> 42:08.291
Yeah, I like Nash. He's nice.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.126
Yeah, I do, too.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.395
Christmas is coming.
Are you excited?

42:12.464 --> 42:13.496
Yeah.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.933
What's wrong?

42:17.002 --> 42:20.136
I want Christmas
to be here, but...

42:21.540 --> 42:23.773
It's the last one
at grandma and grandpa's?

42:23.808 --> 42:27.143
I know. It's a special place.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.813
We're all gonna miss something
about it.

42:30.916 --> 42:35.151
I liked cutting down the tree.
It reminds me of daddy.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.722
- Oh, honey...
- It's okay. It's a good feeling.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.159
You are awesome.

42:44.396 --> 42:45.962
Night, munchkin.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.965
- Goodnight, mom. Love you.
- I love you.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.461
Handyman reporting for duty.

43:18.496 --> 43:22.332
Wow. You weren't joking
about getting a jump on things.

43:22.367 --> 43:24.300
Oh, I never joke
about home renovations.

43:24.402 --> 43:27.704
Hm. So where do we start?

43:27.739 --> 43:29.339
[Nash] Upstairs.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.042
Okay. Hold it steady.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.948
Screwdriver, please.
Thank you.

43:42.621 --> 43:44.988
There you go.

43:45.023 --> 43:48.324
Come on. Come on.
Oh, God! Okay.

43:48.393 --> 43:49.892
[laughing]

43:49.928 --> 43:52.695
Yeah. Okay. Yup. Ah, good work.

43:52.731 --> 43:55.999
Oh. Thank you.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.735
[indistinct chatter]

43:58.770 --> 44:01.638
- Oh, that's looking good.
- Oh!

44:01.740 --> 44:04.707
Did you do this?
That is actually perfect.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.210
[indistinct chatter]

44:07.345 --> 44:09.846
I think it's gonna...
I'm gonna cool it off.

44:09.948 --> 44:11.514
- What?
- Boom. I'm out.

44:11.583 --> 44:12.982
- [laughs]
- Catch you later.

44:13.084 --> 44:14.450
All right? Yeah? Right, right.

44:14.486 --> 44:17.320
- Okay, we good?
- Okay, great.

44:17.455 --> 44:18.455
- Just a...
- Okay, ready?

44:18.490 --> 44:20.223
Good. Go for it.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.791
Okay.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.526
- Yes! All right.
- Aha!

44:23.561 --> 44:26.863
[indistinct chatter]

44:36.841 --> 44:38.608
[cell phone ringing]

44:49.254 --> 44:52.121
[drill whirring]

44:53.058 --> 44:56.325
[indistinct chatter]

44:58.630 --> 45:01.731
[drill whirring]

45:12.077 --> 45:14.110
<i>[instrumental "Jingle Bells"]</i>

45:14.145 --> 45:16.546
Ow! Whoa. Dude, dude, what...

45:16.581 --> 45:18.114
Did you just throw it at me?

45:18.149 --> 45:20.383
[clamoring]

45:24.389 --> 45:26.656
No. Ow...

45:26.725 --> 45:27.957
No!

45:28.059 --> 45:29.625
[Megan] Oh!

45:29.661 --> 45:32.395
- Nice job!
- Defeat! Defeat!

45:32.464 --> 45:34.397
[indistinct chatter]

45:34.499 --> 45:36.032
[laughing]

45:37.302 --> 45:38.302
Look.

45:39.537 --> 45:41.904
Wow! It's cutting down
the tree.

45:42.006 --> 45:43.372
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's really good.

45:43.408 --> 45:46.242
[instrumental music]

45:48.179 --> 45:50.019
But still looks like
there's a lot of this tree

45:50.081 --> 45:51.647
left to decorate.

45:51.783 --> 45:53.416
[footsteps approaching]

45:53.518 --> 45:55.318
Finally found them.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.854
[Daniel] Let's get
to decorating, people.

46:00.291 --> 46:02.258
[clears throat]

46:04.028 --> 46:07.330
Ah, this was the year that you
made the scales of justice.

46:07.432 --> 46:11.000
Yeah. They're in here somewhere.

46:11.136 --> 46:14.103
- Remember this?
- Oh, of course.

46:14.239 --> 46:15.738
What is it?

46:16.741 --> 46:18.574
[Peggy sighs]

46:18.610 --> 46:21.244
It's the Eiffel Tower.

46:21.312 --> 46:24.781
Your grandpa made this years ago
after we came back from Paris.

46:24.883 --> 46:27.283
- You went to France?
- We did.

46:27.318 --> 46:29.085
And I introduced your grandpa

46:29.120 --> 46:31.854
to the beautiful paintings
in the Louvre.

46:31.923 --> 46:35.424
We had plenty of adventures
before settling down here.

46:35.527 --> 46:38.461
And, hopefully,
we'll have plenty more.

46:38.496 --> 46:40.763
I remember making this one.

46:43.034 --> 46:45.835
Mom, I don't wanna go back
to Austin.

46:46.471 --> 46:47.737
Oh, honey.

46:47.872 --> 46:50.373
I don't want this
to be our last Christmas here.

46:50.475 --> 46:52.742
It won't be the same
somewhere else.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.948
I know.

46:59.050 --> 47:02.685
But we can't forget all the
great ones we've already had.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.389
We should enjoy this one
as much as we can.

47:06.457 --> 47:08.024
That's my girl.

47:08.126 --> 47:10.259
Now, you know what I think
would help us feel better?

47:10.361 --> 47:11.627
What?

47:11.696 --> 47:14.096
Some of grandma's hot chocolate.

47:14.199 --> 47:17.500
Hm. I think
that's a wonderful idea.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.802
- I'll help.
- Okay.

47:19.871 --> 47:20.903
[clears throat]

47:28.179 --> 47:29.245
[Peggy coughs]

47:32.016 --> 47:33.583
- Hey.
- [Daniel] Here.

47:34.586 --> 47:35.586
Hey.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.187
You okay?

47:39.057 --> 47:40.356
Yeah.

47:40.391 --> 47:43.426
Okay. Well, I should head out.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.595
You sure?

47:45.630 --> 47:49.065
Yeah. Go be with Ivy.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.105
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.776
Yeah, well, um,
I'll see you soon.

48:00.845 --> 48:01.878
Mm-hmm.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.447
[Daniel] Night, Nash.

48:04.482 --> 48:06.616
Ah, goodnight, Mr. Marvin.

48:06.718 --> 48:08.951
- Goodnight, George.
- Goodnight.

48:15.260 --> 48:17.159
[Lane on voicemail]

48:17.228 --> 48:18.394
<i>Sorry I missed your call.</i>

48:18.429 --> 48:19.829

48:19.931 --> 48:22.198

48:22.233 --> 48:24.500
Hey, Lane. Um...

48:27.472 --> 48:30.439
Sorry to, uh, call so late.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.041
Uh, can we meet up for coffee
tomorrow?

48:32.143 --> 48:34.911
I just wanna go over
a few things.

48:36.214 --> 48:37.214
Yeah.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.860

[chuckles] Excuse me,
this is a private show.

49:58.997 --> 50:01.230
You owe me thirty bucks.

50:01.265 --> 50:04.834
[whistles] Steep. But worth it.

50:04.936 --> 50:06.669
So any chances
one will end up online?

50:06.738 --> 50:09.171
Yeah, if there's
a Christmas miracle.

50:09.273 --> 50:11.807
Well, I'm glad to see you
embracing the Christmas spirit.

50:11.909 --> 50:13.809
Ugh!

50:13.878 --> 50:16.278
Hey, you haven't seemed as upset
about the house lately.

50:16.414 --> 50:20.116
Yeah, well, I'm still
not thrilled about it, but...

50:20.251 --> 50:23.052
Actually, me, neither.

50:23.087 --> 50:26.188
I didn't realize it
until the last couple of days.

50:26.257 --> 50:30.026
I'm finally starting to feel
like I belong here again.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.929
But it is not our decision
to make.

50:35.266 --> 50:36.999
We have to let it go, right?

50:37.068 --> 50:39.702
[Bethany] What? Are you serious?

50:41.372 --> 50:43.272
Was that Bethany?

50:46.577 --> 50:48.411
What's going on?

50:48.513 --> 50:49.945
You dropped out of college?

50:50.048 --> 50:51.280
Mom!

50:51.315 --> 50:54.750
It just slipped.
I assumed you told her.

50:54.786 --> 50:57.053
Can you believe this?

50:57.789 --> 51:00.022
Wait, you know?

51:00.091 --> 51:01.891
[scoffs] Wow. Great.

51:01.926 --> 51:03.606
Everyone in the family knows
except for me.

51:03.661 --> 51:05.428
Yeah, because I knew
you'd freak out.

51:05.463 --> 51:07.196
Audrey, I'm trying to help you.

51:07.298 --> 51:09.799
Bethany, it is so not
a big deal.

51:09.834 --> 51:13.702
Not a big deal? I helped you
write your application. [scoffs]

51:13.805 --> 51:15.838
I had to pull some strings
to get you an interview.

51:15.873 --> 51:18.340
I'm sorry, okay?

51:18.409 --> 51:20.254
But you don't have to treat me
like I'm a child.

51:20.278 --> 51:22.144
Yes, I do, because you keep
acting like one.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.379
You guys!

51:23.414 --> 51:24.780
I don't need to take this.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.482
I'll be at Brandon's
if anyone needs me.

51:26.517 --> 51:29.185
Audrey, wait,
it's Christmas Eve.

51:29.287 --> 51:30.486
[door slams]

51:31.789 --> 51:32.988
Uh...

51:38.029 --> 51:39.469
Yeah. I've given it
a lot of thought.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.464
It's just...

51:41.499 --> 51:43.566
not the right thing for me
right now.

51:43.634 --> 51:46.168
Wow. Well, I have to say
I'm pretty surprised.

51:46.204 --> 51:48.471
You seemed so excited
about the house.

51:48.573 --> 51:52.408
Um, I know the inspection report
wasn't exactly glowing, but...

51:52.443 --> 51:56.512
Yeah, it's...
It's not about that.

51:56.647 --> 51:59.115
Okay, so what is it about?

51:59.217 --> 52:00.716
[Nash sighs]

52:00.818 --> 52:04.453
This house is important
to the Marvins.

52:04.489 --> 52:05.889
Way more important
than it is to me.

52:05.957 --> 52:07.067
And if you'd been there
last night...

52:07.091 --> 52:11.127
- Ah. Of course.
- What?

52:11.229 --> 52:13.195
I told you this would happen.

52:13.231 --> 52:14.597
You have a history with Megan,

52:14.632 --> 52:17.366
so I guess
it shouldn't come as a shock

52:17.435 --> 52:19.335
that you'd fall for her again.

52:19.437 --> 52:21.403
[scoffs] You're not thinking
clearly.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.706
No, I am thinking clearly.

52:23.841 --> 52:26.809
[scoffs] What is it, guilt?

52:26.844 --> 52:29.011
Why? Her parents
want to sell the house.

52:29.046 --> 52:30.980
Everybody's onboard,

52:31.015 --> 52:33.749
except for you, apparently.

52:33.784 --> 52:37.153
Look, what you're feeling
is natural.

52:37.255 --> 52:39.054
Okay? It's a big purchase.

52:39.190 --> 52:43.025
But, please, make the decision
for the right reason.

52:43.094 --> 52:46.695
Don't back out because you feel
bad for doing nothing wrong.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.534
Then why does it feel wrong?

52:53.504 --> 52:55.070
Because you're thinking
with your heart,

52:55.173 --> 52:57.139
instead of your head.

52:57.208 --> 52:59.742
Say, you don't buy the house,

52:59.777 --> 53:02.912
what happens when Megan goes
back to Austin after Christmas?

53:03.014 --> 53:04.180
How does it help?

53:05.816 --> 53:09.018
Daniel and Peggy
are anxious to sell.

53:09.120 --> 53:11.064
Isn't it better the house go
to someone they know?

53:11.088 --> 53:14.223
Someone they trust, who'd
give it the love it deserves?

53:16.327 --> 53:20.229
Not to mention, you'd be leaving
me high and dry in the process.

53:22.934 --> 53:24.500
Just sleep on it.

53:25.903 --> 53:28.237
I'm sure you'll come
to the right decision.

53:30.141 --> 53:32.775
Okay, but if it still
doesn't feel right...

53:34.679 --> 53:36.912
Then you and I will settle out.

53:47.124 --> 53:48.924
Just because she has a career
and a husband

53:48.960 --> 53:50.504
and doesn't live at home
with her parents

53:50.528 --> 53:53.262
doesn't mean
that she's better than me.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.231
Bethany doesn't think
she's better than you.

53:55.333 --> 53:57.366
She's just hurt
you didn't tell her.

53:57.468 --> 54:01.303
I just thought I could make it,
you know?

54:02.473 --> 54:06.342
If I recorded a song
or something,

54:06.410 --> 54:08.611
maybe they wouldn't be
so disappointed in me.

54:08.646 --> 54:11.981
Who do you think's
disappointed in you? Bethany?

54:12.116 --> 54:15.951
Her life is so together
and mine's never been.

54:15.987 --> 54:17.319
[scoffs]

54:17.555 --> 54:20.956
Maybe that's why I've been
holding on to the house so much.

54:20.992 --> 54:22.725
They have their lives
to go back to.

54:22.793 --> 54:24.893
But once the house is gone,

54:24.996 --> 54:26.795
I don't really have
anything else.

54:26.897 --> 54:28.897
Yes, you do.

54:29.033 --> 54:31.300
You have courage.

54:31.435 --> 54:33.335
I mean,
putting everything on the line

54:33.371 --> 54:36.038
to pursue your dream of music?

54:36.140 --> 54:38.240
That takes guts.

54:38.309 --> 54:41.744
I have no doubt in my mind
that if you keep trying,

54:41.812 --> 54:43.545
you're gonna make it.

54:43.648 --> 54:45.948
- You think so?
- Yeah.

54:46.083 --> 54:48.550
And what about everything else
you have?

54:48.619 --> 54:50.452
Passion, beauty,

54:50.521 --> 54:54.456
and let's not forget me,
which is also super valuable.

54:54.492 --> 54:57.426
[chuckles] Thanks, Brandon.

55:01.832 --> 55:03.365
- And there. All right.
- There we go.

55:03.434 --> 55:04.633
Let me see.

55:04.735 --> 55:06.302
- What do you think, there?
- Yeah.

55:06.337 --> 55:08.437
Kinda close together.
Ah, that's pretty good.

55:08.572 --> 55:09.838
[Ivy] That's good.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.240
[gasps] I can't believe

55:11.342 --> 55:13.142
you're doing the snowman
without me.

55:13.210 --> 55:15.577
- Hey, mom.
- Hey. You know the rules.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.213
It's Christmas Eve.
We had to do it today.

55:18.316 --> 55:21.817
Grandma, why do we build
a snowman on Christmas Eve?

55:21.852 --> 55:25.321
I never told you? Huh!

55:25.389 --> 55:29.558
Well, when I was a little girl,
younger than you,

55:29.660 --> 55:31.860
there was one year
grandpa was stuck in a blizzard

55:31.962 --> 55:33.195
and couldn't make it home.

55:33.331 --> 55:35.764
Yup, I took my AP students
on a field trip

55:35.800 --> 55:38.233
to Coolidge State Park
over winter break.

55:38.269 --> 55:41.704
Unfortunately,
the roads were so bad

55:41.739 --> 55:43.105
when they wanted to come home

55:43.140 --> 55:47.009
that they were stuck there
for two days.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.011
I was so sad
that on Christmas Eve

55:49.046 --> 55:50.846
your grandma and I
made a snowman

55:50.948 --> 55:52.181
to look just like grandpa,

55:52.249 --> 55:53.582
with his clothes and all.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.150
So that way,
on Christmas morning,

55:55.219 --> 55:57.386
it was like
he was there with us.

55:57.421 --> 55:59.688
And we started doing it
every year.

56:01.258 --> 56:04.026
I think he's still missing
one thing.

56:05.429 --> 56:06.662
[chuckles]

56:12.069 --> 56:14.703
I guess we won't be doing this
in Arizona.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.839
[chuckles]

56:16.941 --> 56:18.841
Not unless we build one
out of rocks.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.776
Hey, it sounds like fun to me.

56:20.845 --> 56:21.845
Ha!

56:29.920 --> 56:31.887
There. What do you think?

56:31.922 --> 56:34.857
I think it's perfect.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.893
Mom, we haven't done
the Christmas firework tour,

56:37.995 --> 56:40.629
and this is the night
they do it.

56:40.664 --> 56:43.265
You are so right.

56:43.300 --> 56:46.068
- Grandma?
- Let's go.

56:46.137 --> 56:47.669
- Yay!
- Yay!

56:48.739 --> 56:51.707
Hey. You sure you up for it?

56:51.809 --> 56:53.709
I know this was always
your and James' thing.

56:53.744 --> 56:57.746
Yeah. I know James
wouldn't want us to miss it.

56:57.815 --> 57:00.916
Mom, can we invite Nash?

57:01.819 --> 57:03.051
Uh...

57:04.021 --> 57:05.287
Yeah, sure.

57:05.423 --> 57:08.524
[instrumental music]

57:09.326 --> 57:12.594
[fireworks exploding]

57:19.937 --> 57:23.372
- [Megan] Hey.
- I've not done this in forever.

57:23.407 --> 57:25.474
Thank you
for letting me tag along.

57:25.543 --> 57:26.842
My pleasure.

57:27.044 --> 57:28.922
Our parents already went ahead,
but our ride should be

57:28.946 --> 57:30.145
right around that corner.

57:30.181 --> 57:31.914
Uh, we'll meet back here
real soon.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.282
Yeah. Sounds good.

57:33.317 --> 57:35.751
Mom, can I ride
with Aunt Bethany?

57:35.786 --> 57:37.519
Uh, as long as it's okay
with them.

57:37.621 --> 57:40.456
- Of course. Come on.
- Definitely.

57:40.524 --> 57:41.924
Come on.

57:44.261 --> 57:45.561
Have fun!

57:51.001 --> 57:53.068
Giddyup! There we go.

57:53.170 --> 57:54.703
Bye!

57:58.375 --> 58:01.276
Well, looks like
it's just the two of us.

58:04.515 --> 58:05.747
Whoa!

58:08.919 --> 58:10.319
Allow me.

58:17.261 --> 58:18.460
Oh...

58:20.397 --> 58:21.497
[driver clicks tongue]

58:21.599 --> 58:23.232
Let's go. Come on.

58:31.942 --> 58:33.642
- [chuckles]
- Hm.

58:35.880 --> 58:40.415
You know... this is kinda
starting to feel like a date.

58:41.352 --> 58:43.085
[chuckles] Yeah.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.454
Well, we haven't done this
since senior year.

58:45.489 --> 58:47.022
Yeah.

58:47.057 --> 58:49.958
I have really enjoyed
being back here this Christmas.

58:50.027 --> 58:52.928
- Yeah, me, too.
- Hm.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.364
I have to ask.

58:55.432 --> 58:58.233
Is it a coincidence
that out of all the houses

58:58.335 --> 59:01.370
you could have chosen to buy,
you chose to buy ours?

59:01.472 --> 59:04.006
I know the house.
It's a good property.

59:04.141 --> 59:07.476
I wanna make it the best
it can be and send it off right.

59:08.846 --> 59:12.281
Well, at least
that's what I wanted at first.

59:12.349 --> 59:14.316
But then we started seeing
more of each other

59:14.418 --> 59:17.586
and it was... great

59:17.621 --> 59:20.055
being with you
and your family again.

59:22.226 --> 59:24.560
So what if I want
something more?

59:28.766 --> 59:32.534
What, is that so crazy?
Megan, I know you.

59:32.570 --> 59:36.738
Where do you see this going?
Because...

59:36.774 --> 59:41.276
Yeah... we've both felt
something.

59:41.312 --> 59:44.246
And, honestly... it's something

59:44.381 --> 59:47.049
I haven't felt in a long time.

59:47.151 --> 59:49.685
But what if it's just nostalgia?

59:49.820 --> 59:54.122
The magic of Woodstock
and Christmas.

59:54.191 --> 59:57.693
Ivy and I get on a plane in
a few days to go back to Austin.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.361
Why?

59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.997
Because that's where
our life is.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.133
It doesn't have to be.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:08.070
Megan, I...

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:10.405
I realized
that even after 17 years,

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:14.009
the way I feel about you
is exactly the same.

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:16.511
I never stopped caring
about you.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.749
And I don't wanna
lose you again.

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:25.921
But I can't just
uproot our lives.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.690
W-what about my job?
What about Ivy?

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.292
I can't just pull her out
of school,

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:31.567
take her away from her friends.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.962
She said she didn't even
wanna go back.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:34.998
Stop.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.202
This isn't about where I live.

01:00:41.438 --> 01:00:42.938
And it isn't about our house.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:48.243
It... it isn't even about you.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:51.246
Okay.

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:57.085
Have you ever lost someone?

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:59.721
Someone you loved so much

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:03.725
that life without them
seemed impossible,

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:07.929
like a piece of you
was lost, too?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.568
I'm not ready

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:17.673
to face that kind of hurt
ever again.

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.279
Yeah, I, I understand.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:32.187
Then you'll let me enjoy
our time together right now...

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:35.524
just for what it is.

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:45.534
[driver] Okay, folks.
Ride's almost over.

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:47.869
Merry Christmas.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:54.143
Whoa!

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.780
I'm sorry, Nash.

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.688
Truly I'm sorry.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.233
Wasn't that the best?

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:21.503
I'm so glad we got to do that
one more time.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.706
What's wrong?

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:28.677
Nothing.

01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:30.812
I was just saying goodnight
to your mother.

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:35.050
Goodbye, Megan.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:39.321
Goodbye.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.666
Hey, everything okay?

01:02:57.474 --> 01:02:58.707
Yeah.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.486
[knocking]

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:27.002
This is an unexpected surprise.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.539
Yeah, I was just
passing by and...

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.346
I take it you've thought
about our conversation.

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:39.648
Yes...

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.051
And I'm sorry.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.087
I didn't know this was gonna
put you in a tight spot, but...

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:49.791
I've to back out.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:53.762
[chuckles] It-it turns out I
was, uh, thinking with my heart

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:56.231
and, uh, turns out

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.034
that my heart is pretty stupid.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:00.335
[clears throat]

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:03.171
So you and Megan...

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:04.739
Yeah, it's over.

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:07.876
But even if she doesn't
wanna be with me,

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:12.614
I, I know how she feels
about that house.

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:15.417
It just doesn't feel right
to fix it up

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.086
and sell it to someone else.

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:20.288
And how does Megan feel
about this?

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.657
She doesn't know.

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:24.726
Not yet.

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.563
[exhales sharply] Okay.

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.899
If that's what you want.
I mean...

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:34.669
Really?

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:38.340
Yeah. We had an agreement
and you've made your choice.

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:42.577
- So...
- Um, thank you, Lane.

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:46.281
And then I'll pay you back
your half of the deposit.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.850
Uh, it's gonna take me a while,

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:51.987
but I will get you every penny.

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:55.857
I'm sure
we can work somethin' out.

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:58.193
Can I offer you some advice?

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:01.529
Yeah, sure.

01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:04.733
If you care enough about Megan
to kill this deal,

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:07.435
why are you lettin' her go
so easily?

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:20.315
Hi, sweetheart.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.217
Did you guys go
on the fireworks tour?

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:24.786
It was so beautiful.
We missed you.

01:05:24.855 --> 01:05:27.122
I missed you, too.

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:31.059
Well, we're all here now
and it's Christmas Eve.

01:05:31.128 --> 01:05:33.206
Yeah, what are we standing
around for? We should be...

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.263
[whispering] Everybody's here.

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:36.831
Wait.

01:05:37.868 --> 01:05:40.235
Megan, is something wrong?

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:42.971
Uh, no.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:45.607
Nash and I...

01:05:47.678 --> 01:05:49.177
It got complicated

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.880
and I probably
won't be seeing him again.

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:54.482
But tonight I told him that,
you know,

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.919
we have our lives back in Austin

01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:00.522
and that being here
this Christmas Eve,

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:04.459
even though it reminded me
how much I love this place,

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:06.561
that it didn't matter.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:10.465
But the truth is, even as I was
saying it, I didn't believe it.

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:13.468
Mom, dad, I-I'm so happy for you

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:16.371
to start this next chapter
of your lives,

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.107
but I feel guilty...

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.609
'cause the fact is
that I am not ready

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.044
to let go of this house.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.047
Well, why didn't you tell us
sooner?

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:28.149
I didn't wanna ruin your plans.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.920
You deserve to retire,
go on adventures.

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:34.255
And I was worried that
if you knew how I really felt,

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:37.192
that you might put the sale
of the house on hold.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.962
Oh, and, Ivy, honey,
I know how much you've loved

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:43.098
doing all the Christmas
traditions this year,

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.934
because I have loved it
just as much.

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.671
But I promise you that no matter

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.307
where we spend Christmas,

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.276
we'll bring the magic
of this place with us.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:59.214
I don't want us to fight.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.757
Well, you heard her.
No fighting.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.692
Only the Christmas spirit here.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.761
Let's get this celebration
started.

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:16.097
Ivy, let's see
what's in your stocking.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.073
- You have a sec?
- Sure.

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:33.848
Megan's right,
we shouldn't spend

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:36.818
our last Christmas here
fighting, so...

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:42.190
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.160
Okay.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:47.128
I shouldn't have lied to you.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:50.765
I was ashamed, I guess.

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:53.568
I didn't want you
to be disappointed in me,

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:56.337
because sometimes it feels like

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:59.474
that's the only dynamic we have
anymore.

01:08:02.646 --> 01:08:06.214
- What happened to us?
- What do you mean?

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:08.883
When we were kids,
we were best friends.

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.720
I-I miss being that close.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:17.459
I guess we both grew up.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.464
We started our own lives
and just... drifted apart.

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:25.633
I think that's what
I was afraid of

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:27.268
with the house.

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:30.337
We all live in different places

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.675
and this house is our anchor.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:36.444
And mom and dad started talking
about moving to Arizona,

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.281
and I just freaked out.

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:43.751
What would happen
if we didn't have this?

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:46.386
Maybe we'd start missing
Christmas.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.593
I'm sorry, too.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.095
I know I treat you
like a child sometimes,

01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:56.430
and I don't mean to.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:01.169
I just don't know
how else to help you.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:04.272
I've always played it safe,
by the rules,

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.975
and it's worked for me.

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:12.313
But you, you have
so much talent and passion.

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:15.850
And I've always been jealous
of that.

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:18.118
[scoffs]

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:22.357
I'm glad we're getting one more
Christmas here together.

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:25.326
Feels like we're getting
a second chance,

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:27.862
and I wanna make the most of it.

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.464
I do, too.

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:33.100
I have some news.

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:34.801
- [footsteps approaching]
- Yeah.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:38.805
Everyone, listen up!
We have a serious problem.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.575
What's wrong?

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:43.411
Bethany has an announcement
to make

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:46.247
and it's going to affect
Christmas.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:51.219
We're gonna have to hang
another stocking next year.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:54.889
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:57.025
Oh! Congratulations!

01:09:57.127 --> 01:09:58.426
- Oh.
- Thank you.

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.695
Oh!

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.331
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:10:03.433 --> 01:10:05.200
- Mom!
- George.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.601
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.437
- Sweetheart.
- [chuckles]

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.406
You're gonna have a cousin.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.809
- Daddy.
- Oh, come here.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.245
How excited are you?

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.614
It's exciting. It's exciting.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.382
[laughs] Yay!

01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:25.820
[instrumental music]

01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.587
Merry Christmas, mom.

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:02.423
- Merry Christmas.
- Hm.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.735
[sighs] Wonderful about Bethany.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.471
Yeah!

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:18.773
Oh, I'm so excited for them.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:23.244
Are you ready to move on?

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:28.383
I guess.

01:11:29.753 --> 01:11:32.053
Gonna miss my room.

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:34.989
I mean...

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:37.825
take another chance at life?

01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:44.732
- What?
- You light up around Nash.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:47.568
I haven't seen that in years.

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:50.338
Mom.

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:51.739
I know it's scary to commit

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:54.208
to someone after James,

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:57.412
but you owe it
to yourself and Ivy

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.580
to be brave.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:03.251
Brave.

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:06.487
You have a lot of life
in front of you.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:10.224
And I wanna see my daughter
truly happy.

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:14.395
And now you have the chance.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.465
You'll never know
unless you try.

01:12:22.272 --> 01:12:23.671
All right.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:27.342
I just needed to say it.

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:32.480
Well...

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:36.551
time to get breakfast started.

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:37.586
Okay.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:15.823
Tell Ivy
I'll be back in a while.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:37.178
Of course.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.314
[drill whirring]

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.789
[drill powers off]

01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:54.762
You know that's rude.

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:57.732
[Megan] Well, it's Christmas.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.667
What are you doing?

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:03.337
Trying not to think about you.

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:11.679
Everything I said to you
last night in the carriage,

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.415
I realized
I hadn't said out loud before.

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:19.887
And this morning I thought,

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.790
if I can share that with you,

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:25.092
I can share all my feelings
with you.

01:14:26.329 --> 01:14:28.963
So I have something
I need to tell you.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:30.531
Yeah.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:35.403
I love you.

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:40.808
Love you.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.415
I love you.

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:50.485
[chuckles]

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:09.337
So, um, Megan,

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:12.540
um, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:14.675
Okay.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:17.745
I bailed out
on the partnership with Lane.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.949
I'm no longer
going to be buying your house.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.854
Yeah, I couldn't see myself

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.123
surrounded by the memories
of your house

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:31.459
while I knew
you didn't want me around.

01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:35.930
Wait a minute.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.299
Do you think
Lane would do us a huge favor

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.434
on Christmas morning?

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.874
Just what we needed.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.442
Thanks, George.

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:51.178
Thank you.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:54.549
First present. Go ahead.

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:57.985

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:02.056
- [Daniel laughs]
- [Peggy] Oh!

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:05.226
- [chuckles]
- Cool!

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:07.295
And if you wanna know
how it formed,

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:08.440
your grandpa will tell you.

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:11.465
- Actually, it...
- Later.

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:13.000
Merry Christmas.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:15.002
[Peggy] Nash!
[Megan] Sorry we're late.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:17.438
Merry Christmas.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.140
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:22.276
Mom, it's time for presents.
Sit down.

01:16:22.378 --> 01:16:24.178
Oh, okay.

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:26.814
So who's going first?

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:27.916
Ivy?

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:31.352
Actually... we sort of have

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:33.220
something for everyone.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:36.591
[chuckles] A last-minute gift.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.865
We hope everyone likes it.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.068
Well, what is it?

01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:59.714
It's a purchase offer
for the house from Megan.

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:01.349
And Nash.

01:17:03.553 --> 01:17:05.620
[Peggy] I don't understand.

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:08.122
I thought Nash and Lane...

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:12.059
I am sorry to say,
but that previous deal...

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.161
fell apart. [chuckles]

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:15.730
But it's for the best.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.432
You'll see that the offer
is exactly the same,

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:19.534
not a penny less.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:20.646
Well, how did you get this all

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:21.736
together this morning?

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.270
Well, we had Lane draft it up

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.839
this morning.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.440
We wanted to make it official.

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:27.575
Megan...

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.343
[Megan] Mom, it's like you said.

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:32.313
It's time for me
to take a chance.

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:35.182
And I don't want this
to be our last year here.

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.585
So it's a gift for everyone.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.221
It's our home
so we can keep celebrating

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.922
our family Christmas.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:44.358
Nash is gonna re-invest
his initial offer

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:46.827
and I'm going to apply
for a business loan.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:49.196
- A business loan?
- [Megan] Yeah.

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:51.043
It's like mom and dad said,
this house is too big

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:53.034
for a couple of people,

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:56.203
but we have some great
bed-and-breakfast ideas.

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:58.472
Yeah, I know
this amazing local chef

01:17:58.508 --> 01:17:59.940
who's gonna help me run it.

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:01.475
That is, as soon as she gives

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:04.812
her two weeks' notice in Austin.

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:07.548
And, of course,
there will be some ground rules.

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:10.117
We won't be doing
much renovation.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.453
Except, we are going to fix
all the problems

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:15.990
that were found
in the inspection report.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:19.093
Yeah, um, some of those

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.696
may have been a bit exaggerated.

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:23.264
Really?

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:26.000
And, of course, the entire house
will be reserved

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:27.301
every Christmas

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:29.203
for one very large,

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.206
very rambunctious family.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:35.342
But I only want to do this
if everyone's onboard.

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:39.847
Ivy, do you still wanna
stay here?

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:41.082
Yeah.

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:44.485
Mom? dad?

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:49.590
It looks like we'll be
celebrating Christmas here

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.559
for longer than we thought.

01:18:51.661 --> 01:18:53.294
[all laughing]

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:57.798
I'm so happy for you.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.511
- Thanks, mom.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:03.137
- Let's open presents.
- That is a great idea.

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:04.572
- Let's see.
- What is this one?

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:07.208
- I think for...
- For you, dad.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.643
- [doorbell rings]
- I'll get it.

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:15.916
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:18.319
- I was hoping you'd stop by.
- Of course, I came by.

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:19.920
How else would I give you
a present?

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:22.223
You got me a present?

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:28.429
Huh! No way!

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:33.033
Megan told me
you hawked your guitar.

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:35.069
And that didn't seem right,

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.971
not with a voice
as pretty as yours.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:38.105
[chuckles]

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:40.875
It's perfect.

01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:42.877

Everybody,
look what Brandon got me.

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:58.065

- Merry Christmas, guys.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.394
- Hey, Brandon.
- Merry Christmas, Brandon.

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:03.364
- Hi.

Um, okay.

I dedicate this song

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:15.676
