WEBVTT

00:03.026 --> 00:04.268
We need to get this ship

00:04.269 --> 00:07.246
out of Clarence's clutches
once and for all.

00:07.272 --> 00:09.205
- Any ideas?
- Chookity pok.

00:09.239 --> 00:10.757
- Chookity.
- Ugh!

00:10.758 --> 00:13.829
That might be the most disgusting
thing I have ever heard.

00:13.830 --> 00:17.696
Your incivility is only exceeded
by your buffoonery.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.041
Bango. Got him.

00:19.042 --> 00:21.044
Give me a blaster
and five minutes,

00:21.079 --> 00:24.254
and I'll assassinate
that slimy little hobgoblin.

00:24.289 --> 00:26.705
- I got it.
- Ooh. What's the plan?

00:26.739 --> 00:28.534
- They say the ship belongs to them.
- Yes.

00:28.569 --> 00:30.225
- We know it's ours.
- Yeah?

00:30.226 --> 00:33.194
Time to reclaim this property
the Ventrexian way.

00:33.629 --> 00:36.232
- And how is that done?
- Trust.

00:37.302 --> 00:41.823
Okay.
What did I just agree to?

00:41.858 --> 00:45.724
- Mission accomplished.
- Mission accom... Oh!

00:45.758 --> 00:48.382
Oh! It smells like ...
Oh!

00:48.416 --> 00:51.385
Did you just piss all over the ship?

00:51.419 --> 00:54.215
That's how you claim territory
where I come from.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.390
By pissing everywhere?

00:57.529 --> 00:59.565
You brilliant rascal.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.083
Ugh!

01:01.084 --> 01:04.053
Your Ventrexian just pissed
all over my ship.

01:04.087 --> 01:07.228
That's right, he did.
The Crimson Light is ours, yo.

01:07.263 --> 01:09.851
We reclaimed it, the all-natural way.

01:09.886 --> 01:12.682
Pardon me, but did you say
you claimed my ship?

01:12.716 --> 01:13.716
It's been reclaimed.

01:13.717 --> 01:15.417
- Reclaimed!
- Reclaimed!

01:15.443 --> 01:18.067
That's Ventrexian Piss Etiquette 101.

01:18.101 --> 01:20.919
Once the piss hits stuff,
it's ours.

01:20.954 --> 01:21.862
Fox.

01:21.863 --> 01:23.450
- Yes, father?
- Piss it up.

01:23.451 --> 01:26.765
It's time to reclaim our territory.

01:26.799 --> 01:29.837
Oh, no. Spider Cat,
they're double pumping.

01:29.871 --> 01:31.943
I think I got some more in me,
Thunder Bandit.

01:31.977 --> 01:33.737
Ju... Juice it.
Juice it out.

01:35.894 --> 01:37.603
Don't cross the streams,
little buddy!

01:37.638 --> 01:39.605
Aah! Oh!

01:39.640 --> 01:41.435
It's in my ...
It's in my mouth.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.883
They got it in my mouth.

01:42.884 --> 01:44.852
KVN's pissing, too.

01:44.886 --> 01:47.993
In the place of a dark lord,
you will have a queen!

01:48.028 --> 01:51.522
- Behold, pi...
- Chookity!

01:52.204 --> 01:54.999
- Gary, I'm scared.
- We got to re-juice.

02:02.042 --> 02:04.009
- Aah!
- Ahh!

02:04.044 --> 02:05.744
Yah!

02:05.769 --> 02:07.080
Aah!

02:07.081 --> 02:08.781
Aah!

02:11.430 --> 02:12.775
Mah!

02:12.776 --> 02:14.882
<i>A vessel is approaching
our location.</i>

02:14.916 --> 02:18.678
<i>- And, Ash, you now have a UTI.
- Yes!</i>

02:18.679 --> 02:21.406
<i>I've never seen a ship
like this before.</i>

02:21.440 --> 02:23.649
These guys do not look friendly.

02:23.684 --> 02:25.479
AVA, spool out
the lightfold engines.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.066
<i>Spooling.</i>

02:27.067 --> 02:29.483
All right, lightfold.

02:29.517 --> 02:33.004
Okay, this is great.
Getting pulled in to the big ship

02:33.038 --> 02:35.316
while we're all smelling like piss.

03:05.735 --> 03:07.663
It's a big ship.
Could be Raiders.

03:07.697 --> 03:09.458
- Could be the Burner Tribe.
- Oh, Raiders.

03:09.492 --> 03:10.906
Ooh, yeah.
Okay, Burner Tribe.

03:10.907 --> 03:12.218
Could have been
a little bit of Burner Tribe.

03:12.219 --> 03:13.530
Let's just hope it's not
the Chomper Club...

03:13.531 --> 03:16.187
- The Chomper Club.
- ...or half of us will be killed, skinned,

03:16.188 --> 03:17.983
- and eaten alive.
- Skinned and eaten alive.

03:18.018 --> 03:19.605
That's the whole ...
the whole gamut there.

03:19.606 --> 03:21.849
Okay. Well, you got
a real sunny disposition.

03:21.884 --> 03:24.851
I have a partly cloudy disposition
with a high in the mid-60s.

03:24.852 --> 03:26.751
Ooh, that sounds like a perfect day.

03:26.785 --> 03:28.994
I'm ready to blow things up
with these!

03:29.029 --> 03:30.824
They're going downtown, y'all.

03:30.858 --> 03:32.895
All right, when the door opens,

03:32.929 --> 03:35.518
we rain a hell-storm
of laser fire,

03:35.553 --> 03:37.831
killing everything in sight.

03:37.865 --> 03:40.005
On three ... one...

03:40.040 --> 03:42.180
two...

03:42.214 --> 03:43.914
three!

03:45.528 --> 03:47.427
Hello! Hello! Hello!

03:47.461 --> 03:49.394
Welcome to the Happy Place!

03:50.775 --> 03:53.260
It's where we harness the power
of your happiness

03:53.294 --> 03:56.608
and use it to light up
the entire world!

03:56.643 --> 03:57.884
- What?
- Uh...

03:57.885 --> 04:00.509
That's so freakin' beautiful.

04:00.543 --> 04:03.132
I like it.
I like you.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.306
You're weird, and I especially like

04:05.341 --> 04:06.755
those freaks in the hover canoe.

04:06.756 --> 04:08.758
- Yo, freaks!
- Hey!

04:08.793 --> 04:11.312
I'm Hushfluffles!

04:11.347 --> 04:12.830
And these are my Fluffles!

04:12.831 --> 04:15.696
And we are going to be
your best friends ever!

04:15.731 --> 04:17.767
No, you won't.
This one's off-limits.

04:17.802 --> 04:19.803
He's mine. All mine.

04:19.838 --> 04:22.737
- A huggle for you.
- Thank you.

04:22.738 --> 04:24.705
And another huggle for you.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.569
- You want a huggle?
- You wanna die?!

04:27.570 --> 04:32.437
Who wants a Chewy Mind-Bendy
or a Super-Smile Gooey Ball?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.439
- What flavor?
- Lemon.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.959
- I'm good.
- I have a brilliant idea.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.272
I'm going to sell this place
to some sucker.

04:40.307 --> 04:42.896
It doesn't even belong to you,
Clarence.

04:42.930 --> 04:46.727
Yes, but the sucker buying it
doesn't know that.

04:46.762 --> 04:50.731
Ash, Fox, don't let my
"property" get away.

04:50.766 --> 04:53.182
No one would know.

04:53.216 --> 04:56.634
Now, who wants to go
to their happy place?!

04:56.668 --> 04:58.429
It's the most fun, dreamlike world

04:58.463 --> 05:01.501
where all your inner fantasies
come to life!

05:01.535 --> 05:03.468
- Right here.
- I want to go in the hover canoe!

05:03.503 --> 05:06.471
Well, I choose Gary Goodspeed.

05:07.610 --> 05:09.440
Oh, hey, you know my name.

05:09.474 --> 05:13.582
Sure! It's not every day
somebody loses a planet!

05:13.616 --> 05:15.962
- You're famous.
- I am?

05:17.793 --> 05:18.862
Yes!

05:18.863 --> 05:21.797
My greatest day just got better.

05:21.831 --> 05:25.283
Something's off about this place.

05:25.317 --> 05:29.494
Get ready, Gary.
Your journey's about to begin.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.704
My God, that's a big needle.
Okay, are you sure about this?

05:32.739 --> 05:35.880
- What are you injecting me with?
- Hyper 7-6.

05:35.914 --> 05:40.056
We're gonna take you to your
most special happy place!

05:40.091 --> 05:41.747
Yeah, of course.
Okay, yeah, totally.

05:41.748 --> 05:44.060
- I could use a day off.
- Have fun!

05:44.095 --> 05:46.477
It's going to get wild!

05:52.655 --> 05:54.968
<i>You're going to your happy place.</i>

05:55.002 --> 05:56.278
<i>Happy place!</i>

05:56.279 --> 05:58.462
<i>Ha-ha-ha-happy place!</i>

05:59.110 --> 06:02.838
Ahh! I forgot how much
I love chopping wood!

06:08.222 --> 06:10.984
The Overlord and his army
of Frost Bears

06:11.018 --> 06:12.744
are destroying
everything in sight!

06:12.779 --> 06:15.644
We need you.
You're the one, Gary.

06:15.678 --> 06:18.370
Sorry, Hushfluffles.
I'm retired.

06:18.405 --> 06:22.443
Got kids, a family, this wood.

06:22.478 --> 06:24.238
- Pop Pop!
- Pop Pop!

06:24.273 --> 06:29.174
Gary, go. Become the
hero you were born to be.

06:29.209 --> 06:32.246
But first, give me some smooches.

06:32.281 --> 06:34.559
Oh, hell yeah, Cookie Wife.
Get in here.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.699
Oh, put those chocolate chips
in my mouth.

06:36.734 --> 06:38.736
Oh. Mm.
Oh, hell yeah.

06:38.770 --> 06:41.739
These Frost Bears,
they have a weakness?

06:41.773 --> 06:44.224
Yes. Super-good dancing.

06:44.258 --> 06:47.572
And super-good dancing
is what makes you happiest!

06:47.607 --> 06:49.781
Wait, how do you know that?

06:49.816 --> 06:52.750
Because happiness is our business!

06:52.784 --> 06:56.408
Pop Pop, are you gonna
dance them to death?

06:56.443 --> 07:00.447
I'll see...
what I can do.

07:05.901 --> 07:07.868
This all seems too perfect.

07:11.803 --> 07:13.771
Nightfall, look at this.

07:19.431 --> 07:21.710
This place just got a lot less happy.

07:21.744 --> 07:23.953
Unless you like
floating dead bodies.

07:23.988 --> 07:26.231
In which case, this place
is pretty terrific.

07:26.266 --> 07:28.613
We've got to find Gary.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.650
Where's Gary, and what
have you done with him?!

07:30.684 --> 07:33.514
He's having a dream
in his happy bubble.

07:35.758 --> 07:38.243
Hmm.
Suddenly, I'm less relaxed.

07:38.278 --> 07:39.623
Oh!

07:55.213 --> 07:56.731
Aah!

08:08.399 --> 08:10.953
What kind of Frost Bear

08:10.988 --> 08:14.957
would murder rainbow cookies
in cold blood?!

08:14.992 --> 08:17.270
You think you're gonna stop us?

08:17.304 --> 08:21.861
Unlucky for you,
I'm here...

08:21.895 --> 08:24.864
- to dance.
- Don't let him dance!

08:24.898 --> 08:26.243
Get him!

08:51.891 --> 08:53.996
Zenbar 9 is free.

08:54.031 --> 08:58.138
Tell the Overlord
his reign of terror is over.

08:58.173 --> 09:01.745
Over? You're over!

09:04.558 --> 09:07.976
A dance wound.
It won't stop me.

09:08.010 --> 09:11.531
- I have a date with the Overlord.
- Good luck.

09:11.565 --> 09:14.879
While you were here,
he captured your wife and kids.

09:16.398 --> 09:18.883
No. Cookie wife.
Cookie kids!

09:18.918 --> 09:20.885
- Wah!
- Aah!

09:20.920 --> 09:25.027
I'm coming.
Wah!

09:37.315 --> 09:40.248
Ugh.
Help me.

09:40.249 --> 09:43.218
You have to get me out of here.

09:43.252 --> 09:46.877
- What is this place?
- Ohh, it's a power plant.

09:46.911 --> 09:51.398
They harvest the energy you
generate from your happy place

09:51.433 --> 09:55.368
to power everything in the galaxy.

09:55.402 --> 09:57.197
- Oh.
- Even toasters?

09:57.232 --> 09:59.958
- Oh, yes.
- What about radios?

09:59.959 --> 10:01.822
Oh, I'm sure of it.

10:01.857 --> 10:05.136
- Electric toothbrushes?
- I... suppose.

10:05.171 --> 10:08.277
- Paper towels?
- Oh, that's not electric.

10:08.312 --> 10:11.902
- Uh, electric paper towels?
- Oh! Those are not real.

10:11.936 --> 10:14.974
- But what if they were?
- Uh... yes.

10:15.008 --> 10:17.286
- He's dead.
- He's dead?!

10:17.321 --> 10:19.323
I had so many more questions!

10:19.357 --> 10:21.946
They're sucking the life out of Gary.

10:21.981 --> 10:26.226
You have any sugar water?

10:26.261 --> 10:30.610
- You really own this place?
- Oh, dear, sweet, Tagaleechi.

10:30.644 --> 10:34.096
This property has been in
my family since Sector RX-532

10:34.131 --> 10:37.099
was but a glimmer
in the Vernubla Nebula.

10:38.825 --> 10:43.623
- That has been a while.
- Oh, yes, it has.

10:43.657 --> 10:45.797
Now make me an offer
on this amazing place

10:45.832 --> 10:49.662
- that I absolutely do own.
- Clarence!

10:49.663 --> 10:51.596
Fraskenhaur, you're just in time.

10:51.631 --> 10:55.323
- What is this?
- A bidding war.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.814
He's up there somewhere.

11:03.815 --> 11:07.405
- Go, Mooncake. Find Gary.
- Chookity pok pok!

11:08.820 --> 11:12.169
Come on, Ashy. We're
gonna get Dad's Gary back.

11:12.203 --> 11:13.376
Whoo!

11:13.377 --> 11:16.828
This one's coming with me.
Get over here!

11:16.863 --> 11:18.727
- I'm not a pet.
- Says you.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.798
I like you because you're all fluffy.

11:20.832 --> 11:23.559
I think he's fluffy, too!
Hooray!

11:23.594 --> 11:26.217
Gary, where are you?

11:26.252 --> 11:31.058
In case you're interested,
H.U.E. is right here. Hey.

11:33.845 --> 11:36.503
Ew. How long have they been
siphoning these people?

11:36.538 --> 11:38.194
Look, pets don't think.

11:38.195 --> 11:42.042
They just sit there and look cute,
like you. Got it?!

11:42.043 --> 11:44.062
- Uh...
- Great.

11:44.063 --> 11:47.583
Keep doing that, and you might
get a snack from my pop pop.

11:47.618 --> 11:51.070
Right, Mr. Yumsters?

11:52.071 --> 11:55.005
- Tribore?
- Um... who's that?

11:55.039 --> 11:57.007
One of us.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.699
One sun sets while the other rises.

11:59.733 --> 12:02.667
Why is there a big letter "R"
on that second sun?

12:02.702 --> 12:04.876
Does it stand
for what I think it does?

12:04.911 --> 12:06.878
Yes. The Resistance.

12:06.913 --> 12:11.331
And I'm its leader, Tribore,
the guardian of hope.

12:11.366 --> 12:13.609
Dream with me and live.

12:13.644 --> 12:15.370
<i>Hooray!</i>

12:18.131 --> 12:19.831
Whoa!

12:21.893 --> 12:25.448
- Ha. How did you get here?
- How the hell do I know?

12:25.449 --> 12:27.692
The last thing I knew,
I was saving the world,

12:27.727 --> 12:30.040
and I've been making
inspirational speeches

12:30.074 --> 12:32.249
to the youth camps ever since.

12:32.283 --> 12:34.699
- Were they well-received?
- Very!

12:34.734 --> 12:37.944
So, why are we standing around
here twiddling our wieners?

12:37.978 --> 12:40.705
You know why?
We're saving my best friend.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.811
If he's caught in one of these things,

12:42.845 --> 12:45.607
he only has until
his "happy" runs out.

12:45.641 --> 12:49.231
Incoming question.
How did you survive this long?

12:49.266 --> 12:52.096
I'm a very jovial person.

12:52.131 --> 12:54.600
Okay, let's rock it to it.

12:59.275 --> 13:00.896
Overlord, Gary's here!

13:00.897 --> 13:02.597
Overlord!

13:04.142 --> 13:06.903
I've just got one thing
I need to know.

13:06.938 --> 13:10.562
Where's cookie wife?
Where's cookie kids?

13:14.152 --> 13:16.430
Alive, but you'll never see them again

13:16.465 --> 13:19.943
unless you out-dance me.

13:21.262 --> 13:24.265
Hushfluffles, play the good stuff.

13:28.649 --> 13:30.098
Aah!

13:32.170 --> 13:34.137
This is a move.

13:39.764 --> 13:41.464
I laughing at you.

13:41.490 --> 13:44.078
Dance, Gary! Dance!

13:55.193 --> 13:56.504
Ooh.

14:00.509 --> 14:01.992
Aah!

14:10.173 --> 14:11.873
Ahh!

14:13.832 --> 14:17.629
You messed with the wrong guy.

14:17.664 --> 14:20.045
Man, can he dance.

14:24.049 --> 14:26.776
Cookie kids!
Cookie wife!

14:26.811 --> 14:29.330
<i>Papa Gary, you saved us.</i>

14:29.365 --> 14:34.196
No... he didn't.

14:34.197 --> 14:35.197
Aah!

14:35.198 --> 14:37.373
Cookie kids!
Cookie wife!

14:37.407 --> 14:41.411
Noooo!

14:42.896 --> 14:44.863
You killed my cookie family.

14:47.072 --> 14:49.385
Now you know how I feel.

14:51.594 --> 14:53.562
Gar Gar Gar Gar!

15:01.259 --> 15:03.330
No, no, no, no!

15:03.364 --> 15:05.228
Nooo!

15:06.264 --> 15:10.682
- Gary!
- I had the strangest dream.

15:10.717 --> 15:13.720
You will not get away from me.

15:13.754 --> 15:15.272
Oh, no, it was real.

15:15.273 --> 15:18.759
Gary, it must be nice to have
the people you love around you.

15:18.794 --> 15:23.281
I would know
because you killed all my loved ones!

15:23.315 --> 15:26.249
And now
I'm going to kill yours.

15:26.284 --> 15:27.905
Who are you?

15:27.906 --> 15:29.286
You don't know me.

15:29.287 --> 15:32.255
I'm Todd H. Watson,
and I know you.

15:32.290 --> 15:35.914
You see, you stole
something from me

15:35.949 --> 15:38.468
when you lost the Earth!

15:38.503 --> 15:41.955
Holly! Jed!
Are you okay?

15:41.989 --> 15:45.717
Talk to me!
Aah!

15:45.752 --> 15:49.410
That was my family!

15:49.445 --> 15:52.448
And then I intercepted
your transmission.

15:53.725 --> 15:56.590
<i>We've lost the Earth,
but I can still save you.</i>

15:56.625 --> 15:59.110
<i>Goodbye, Gary.</i>

15:59.144 --> 16:01.940
I was trying to save the Earth.

16:01.975 --> 16:05.392
I have nobody to blame
but you.

16:05.426 --> 16:09.016
Will this fix anything?
Let's give it a go.

16:11.985 --> 16:16.990
Is there any reason why
I'm not running for my life?

16:17.024 --> 16:18.957
Oh, boy!

16:19.292 --> 16:23.133
- Two million dropnoids!
- Four million!

16:23.134 --> 16:25.791
- Five million!
- Six million!

16:25.792 --> 16:28.382
Seven quadtillion dropnoids.

16:29.036 --> 16:32.936
- Is that actually a number?
- No.

16:32.937 --> 16:36.456
- Get the hell out of here, Raymond.
- Clarence,

16:36.457 --> 16:40.496
a property like this comes on
the market once in a lifetime.

16:40.530 --> 16:45.674
You want to make sure
that it goes into the proper hands.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.952
Seventy million dropnoids.

16:47.986 --> 16:52.163
I'm Clarence, I'm old,
and that baby's sold.

16:52.197 --> 16:54.544
Clarence, we're gentlemen.

16:54.579 --> 17:00.136
- We shake deals with handshakes.
- Congratulations.

17:00.171 --> 17:02.794
Oh, no, Clarence, no.

17:02.829 --> 17:05.141
That's just one of my hands.

17:05.175 --> 17:09.608
You have to shake all of them.

17:18.845 --> 17:22.538
This garbage bot gets rid of... garbage.

17:32.375 --> 17:36.724
Pop Pop! Daddy!
Get on the ship! Sir!

17:36.725 --> 17:39.417
As soon as I finish shaking
this monster's hands.

17:39.451 --> 17:40.900
- Here's one.
- Okay.

17:40.901 --> 17:42.731
I've got another one
right over here.

17:42.765 --> 17:44.594
- Yes. There seems to be no end of them.
- Oh. Mm. Firm one.

17:44.629 --> 17:46.216
I forgot about that one.

17:46.217 --> 17:48.875
- Ah.
- Oh, I have so many hands.

17:48.909 --> 17:50.289
Okay. Here we go.

17:50.290 --> 17:52.223
Run! H.U.E.!
Faster!

17:52.257 --> 17:56.814
- Will you run faster?
- I'm already at maximum speed.

17:56.848 --> 18:00.610
- KVN is saving H.U.E.
- This puts the H.U.E. in humiliation.

18:00.645 --> 18:03.198
- Oh...
- You are super welcome.

18:03.199 --> 18:05.201
One more.
That one's my favorite.

18:05.236 --> 18:08.298
- You've got to be joking.
- Okay! Quick!

18:08.333 --> 18:09.723
Go! Leave!
Take off without him!

18:09.758 --> 18:15.522
Wait! I'm coming!
For God's sakes, hold on.

18:34.437 --> 18:36.750
This doesn't end here.

18:40.478 --> 18:43.177
Anytime, Clarence!

18:48.701 --> 18:50.357
<i>I'm not coming back.</i>

18:50.358 --> 18:52.429
<i>Goodbye, Gary.</i>

18:56.157 --> 18:57.857
Hey.

19:00.713 --> 19:03.370
- What's up?
- What are you doing?

19:03.371 --> 19:05.071
Well, you know, just kind
of feel like being alone,

19:05.097 --> 19:07.893
- if that's okay.
- Yeah. Sure.

19:13.105 --> 19:16.246
All right, not really
what I had in mind, but sure.

19:17.247 --> 19:19.353
Oh. I guess ... I guess
it's a party now.

19:19.387 --> 19:23.667
Did someone say "party"?
'Cause I think they did.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.187
You did not lose the Earth, Gary.

19:26.222 --> 19:29.535
Well, I sure as hell
didn't save it, either, did I?

19:29.570 --> 19:33.401
- You tried your best.
- My dad once told me that.

19:33.402 --> 19:35.403
It was good enough for him.

19:35.438 --> 19:38.682
Thing is, it's not
good enough for me.

19:38.717 --> 19:41.064
Worst party ever.

19:41.099 --> 19:43.791
Gary, in every timeline,

19:43.825 --> 19:46.069
the Earth gets pulled
into the breach.

19:46.104 --> 19:50.384
- There was nothing you could do.
- Yeah, I suppose so.

19:50.418 --> 19:54.422
But why did all this horribleness
have to happen through me?

19:54.457 --> 19:57.080
You said something that helped me

19:57.115 --> 19:59.427
when I was at my lowest point.

19:59.462 --> 20:02.706
We'll get through it together
as a team.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.918
Gah!

20:18.653 --> 20:22.933
As a squad.
As a team squad.

20:22.968 --> 20:24.348
Except for him.

20:24.349 --> 20:27.455
I don't want to be
on your stupid team squad.

20:29.492 --> 20:32.253
And I'm still making my mind up
about them.

20:32.288 --> 20:34.928
Guys? I know you're
new here and you're just

20:34.929 --> 20:37.569
getting to know us, so
I made you something...

20:37.603 --> 20:41.504
out of Little Cato's hair.
You better love it.

20:41.538 --> 20:44.127
Oh, my ...
It's terrifying.

20:44.162 --> 20:48.131
- So, what happened in your happy place?
- Oh, man!

20:48.166 --> 20:50.961
Well, you know, I had a cookie
wife and some cookie kids,

20:50.996 --> 20:53.999
and then they got kidnapped
by a Spanish dance giant.

20:54.033 --> 20:57.002
And there were some Frost Bears
there, too, with some big guns,

20:57.036 --> 20:59.108
and they were murdering
rainbow cookies...
