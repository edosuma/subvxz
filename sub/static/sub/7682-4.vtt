01:00.929 --> 01:03.264
MacGyver!

01:03.265 --> 01:06.350
Great place to start
day one of your vacation.

01:06.351 --> 01:10.229
Vacation, nothing.
This is a Phoenix-sponsored

01:10.230 --> 01:13.941
save the wilderness mapping
expedition, and don't you forget it.

01:13.942 --> 01:16.986
- Just ask the Department of Interior.
- That's right.

01:16.987 --> 01:20.155
This is a highly sensitive
electronic boundary marker.

01:20.156 --> 01:23.909
You've got five of them to place
in your sector, one every ten miles.

01:23.910 --> 01:27.454
- Don't expect a straight line.
- The satellite'll line them up.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.624
Make sure that marker is stationary.
If it slips or falls

01:30.625 --> 01:34.128
or gets washed away by rain water,
our satellite goes berserk.

01:34.129 --> 01:37.214
We need topographical
reference points to chart with.

01:37.215 --> 01:39.715
They'll be solid as a rock.

01:41.886 --> 01:44.386
Works fine.

01:50.353 --> 01:52.771
This is the Tungus weather station.

01:52.772 --> 01:56.441
As far as you're concerned,
it's the last frontier.

01:56.442 --> 01:57.693
So have fun.

01:57.694 --> 02:01.093
I'll see you two in a couple of days.

02:03.074 --> 02:06.744
- MacGyver, take care.
- I usually do.

02:33.312 --> 02:37.190
This untracked wilderness reminded
me of my Minnesota backwoods,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.776
full of the beauty
of old Indian legends.

02:39.777 --> 02:43.488
I was only too happy to be a part of
the Phoenix Foundation 's effort

02:43.489 --> 02:46.324
to map it out, and make it
a national preserve.

02:46.325 --> 02:50.494
And to be honest,
it was just nice being here.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.843
Winslow and Dockins should have
set their second markers by now.

03:05.844 --> 03:09.097
MacGyver picked the toughest sector.
I hope he's up to it.

03:09.098 --> 03:12.100
MacGyver? Are you kidding?
The man is in his element.

03:12.101 --> 03:18.318
I hope so. I've spent the last five
years making this preserve happen.

03:20.776 --> 03:25.357
- Here's that status report you wanted.
- Thank you.

03:28.158 --> 03:31.619
Ah, looks like Sorenson
just placed the second marker.

03:31.620 --> 03:36.374
Dockins, Winslow, Riley,
right on schedule, contact point two.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.502
Roger? Would you print up
that quadrant for me, please?

03:39.503 --> 03:40.711
Right away.

03:40.712 --> 03:43.965
Looks like your man MacGyver's
got some catching up to do.

03:43.966 --> 03:47.426
Don't worry, in a little while
they'll be chasing his tail.

03:47.427 --> 03:51.097
You sure have a lot of faith in
this guy. What makes him so special?

03:51.098 --> 03:53.182
I've known him for eight years now,

03:53.183 --> 03:56.102
and I've never quite been able
to put my finger on it.

03:56.103 --> 03:59.660
He always comes through,
no matter what.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.951
Kind of a strange place
to see a totem pole,

04:11.952 --> 04:16.351
unless this one served
as a warning of some kind.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.250
But a warning of what?

05:28.444 --> 05:30.946
The ancient skeleton
had been placed there

05:30.947 --> 05:33.448
to look out over the land
and protect it.

05:33.449 --> 05:37.494
Whoever the old soul was,
I think he 'd be happy if he knew

05:37.495 --> 05:40.914
we were doing the same thing
with our modern technology.

05:40.915 --> 05:43.415
Protecting the land.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.791
One down, four to go.

06:33.008 --> 06:35.802
So there you are, MacGyver.

06:36.762 --> 06:39.805
Well, what did I tell you?
Right on time.

06:39.806 --> 06:44.999
- Must be in good shape.
- Well, he plays a lot of hockey.

06:45.687 --> 06:48.187
Ow!

06:59.159 --> 07:03.917
Where did you come from,
and what are you doing here?

07:29.147 --> 07:31.647
Hello!

07:35.695 --> 07:38.195
Hello, the ship!

08:23.201 --> 08:27.495
One of my biggest problems is
I can never leave a puzzle alone.

08:27.496 --> 08:30.029
And this ship sure qualified.

09:37.983 --> 09:40.483
Hello, the ship!

11:40.938 --> 11:43.438
Anybody home?

17:27.281 --> 17:31.015
Who are you, and
what are you doing here?

17:32.286 --> 17:36.097
Hold on... Not going to hurt you!
Hold it.

17:52.807 --> 17:55.307
Come on.

17:59.772 --> 18:02.272
Come on. Stay with me.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.740
Trust me on this.

19:00.457 --> 19:02.416
What the heck is that thing?

19:02.417 --> 19:04.917
Hey, come here!

19:05.712 --> 19:07.838
Settle down. Settle down.

19:07.839 --> 19:10.395
Now look at me.
Look at me.

19:11.343 --> 19:14.720
There's nothing but a hundred
miles of raw country

19:14.721 --> 19:17.843
between us and anything except that.

19:20.394 --> 19:22.770
I think it's time you started
to trust me,

19:22.771 --> 19:26.093
or I'm not going to be able to help.

19:56.721 --> 19:59.181
- There's another marker.
- Okay, good.

19:59.182 --> 20:02.476
- MacGyver, right?
- No. That's Sorenson's quadrant.

20:02.477 --> 20:04.019
That's his third marker.

20:04.020 --> 20:08.398
If we can get MacGyver in gear, we might
have the makings of a survey by morning.

20:08.399 --> 20:11.735
He should have gotten to his
next marker point by this time.

20:11.736 --> 20:16.163
Relax, Pete. You said your man
would come through.

20:22.872 --> 20:25.372
Still not talking yet?

20:26.501 --> 20:28.293
Not English, anyway.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.794
How about French?

20:33.174 --> 20:35.674
German?

20:50.942 --> 20:53.611
Thirsty? I am.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.796
Sometimes, when you're in trouble,

21:12.797 --> 21:17.478
you just got to tap Mother Nature
for a little help.

21:41.325 --> 21:43.825
Have a drink.

22:02.763 --> 22:05.263
Ready to talk?

22:10.270 --> 22:12.770
No.

22:12.814 --> 22:15.314
Okay.

22:16.109 --> 22:18.609
Let's get out of here.

22:33.668 --> 22:37.756
Well, we've tried French,
Italian, German.

22:38.965 --> 22:43.719
I'm starting to feel like a tour guide
at the UN, you know.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.220
Joke.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.764
How about Russian?

22:53.980 --> 22:55.522
It is.

22:55.523 --> 22:58.023
It's Russian, huh?

22:58.193 --> 23:00.277
Well, that's great.

23:00.278 --> 23:02.071
Well, maybe not so great.

23:02.072 --> 23:06.522
You're gonna have to put up
with my lousy accent.

23:10.538 --> 23:13.792
By the way, name's MacGyver.

23:15.877 --> 23:19.661
Put this on.
It's a little nippy up here.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.136
You're gonna be all right.

23:27.972 --> 23:30.472
Ma-Gyver?

23:33.561 --> 23:36.230
Yeah. MacGyver.
That's right.

23:37.899 --> 23:40.399
And you?

23:44.197 --> 23:47.116
My name is Karin. Karin Graff.

23:48.743 --> 23:52.966
- You speak English.
- Of course. I am educated.

23:55.082 --> 23:57.793
Tell me, who is Karin Graff?

24:02.298 --> 24:04.798
I am from the Baltic.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.803
But my father is here, in Alaska.

24:10.681 --> 24:12.140
June-now?

24:12.141 --> 24:14.559
- Juneau.
- Juneau.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.896
- Did your dad send for you?
- No. No.

24:17.897 --> 24:21.566
When my mother die,
I write to him to come.

24:21.567 --> 24:24.528
But he writes to me to wait.

24:24.695 --> 24:27.615
He is arranging things.

24:29.158 --> 24:31.658
But I want to be with him.

24:33.454 --> 24:35.622
So my... my cousin, Alexander,

24:35.623 --> 24:39.376
he heard about this ship
going to Alaska,

24:39.543 --> 24:42.296
and he have an idea.

24:42.463 --> 24:45.548
What? To hide on the ship?
Stow away?

24:45.549 --> 24:49.219
Yes. Yes. We bringed food
and blankets.

25:00.397 --> 25:02.897
Karin.

25:04.818 --> 25:07.318
What happened?

25:11.074 --> 25:13.574
We were safe.

25:13.785 --> 25:17.705
The whole trip, Alexander and me.
Until the ship stopped.

25:17.706 --> 25:20.570
The ship stops where you saw it.

25:25.213 --> 25:28.216
And then, it came aboard.

25:29.801 --> 25:33.764
I... I hear the sound, Iike animals...

25:34.556 --> 25:38.100
...and the men are yelling
and running and...

25:38.101 --> 25:40.601
Alexander go to look...

25:42.564 --> 25:45.064
...and it killed him.

25:46.860 --> 25:49.528
- What killed him?
- I don't know!

25:49.529 --> 25:52.364
- Did you get a good look at it?
- No.

25:52.365 --> 25:54.865
No, I...

25:55.243 --> 25:57.743
I saw once a shadow,

25:57.829 --> 26:01.373
bigger, higher than a man,
and... and...

26:01.374 --> 26:03.874
...and once I saw a hand.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.460
I know.

26:07.297 --> 26:09.797
I saw it too.

26:13.428 --> 26:17.620
And I'd sure like to get
a better look at it.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.641
But not until you're safe.

26:24.939 --> 26:28.609
So I want you to eat your dinner,
get to bed.

26:28.610 --> 26:31.755
Got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

26:31.821 --> 26:34.321
You sound like my father.

26:34.490 --> 26:36.990
Yeah?

26:54.844 --> 26:56.803
Hey, hey, take it easy.

26:56.804 --> 26:59.806
Sorry. We didn't mean
to shake you up.

26:59.807 --> 27:02.307
I'm Joe Whales.

27:03.352 --> 27:06.897
This is Dave, my brother.
And Len. He's our uncle.

27:06.898 --> 27:10.358
We've been out checking
our trap lines and saw your fire.

27:10.359 --> 27:11.985
We didn't mean any harm.

27:11.986 --> 27:17.714
Thought we could warm up by
your fire a bit, if you don't mind.

27:18.617 --> 27:21.245
- Okay.
- Thank you.

27:36.051 --> 27:38.992
You guys came up kind of quietly.

27:39.930 --> 27:43.795
Anything in particular
you were looking for?

27:46.478 --> 27:49.011
They know about the creature.

27:53.694 --> 27:56.739
I caught a glimpse of a...

27:56.905 --> 27:59.405
Kind of an oversized animal.

27:59.867 --> 28:01.951
Did you see it too?

28:01.952 --> 28:04.412
No, we didn't see it.

28:04.413 --> 28:06.539
But we saw signs.

28:06.540 --> 28:07.915
And we heard it.

28:07.916 --> 28:10.586
And it got at our trap lines.

28:10.752 --> 28:14.205
And the animals we caught?
It ate 'em.

28:14.715 --> 28:16.507
Like eating candy.

28:16.508 --> 28:22.652
Hey, anything could have been at
those traps. Mountain lions, wolves...

28:23.724 --> 28:25.683
It's a sasquatch.

28:25.684 --> 28:28.184
Sasquatch?

28:28.770 --> 28:30.187
As in Bigfoot?

28:30.188 --> 28:34.384
- Hey, that's just old man talk.
- Yeah, maybe.

28:35.152 --> 28:39.679
But what we saw was big,
hairy and kind of cranky.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.668
When he was little,
he saw sasquatch.

28:53.003 --> 28:56.088
There is a story among
the west coast people...

28:56.089 --> 28:58.340
...that sasquatch comes in the night

28:58.341 --> 29:02.095
to raid our traps
and steal our children.

29:07.517 --> 29:10.269
Well, what we saw killed her cousin.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.062
Then it's back.

29:12.063 --> 29:14.619
And it doesn't want us here.

29:33.167 --> 29:35.667
You call that old man talk?

29:37.922 --> 29:42.259
I don't believe in ghosts.
I believe in explanations.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.927
Reality's strange enough.

29:43.928 --> 29:46.054
Well, I don't want to understand it.

29:46.055 --> 29:48.056
Not if I'm gonna have to face it.

29:48.057 --> 29:51.393
- I just want to get out of here.
- You get no argument from me.

29:51.394 --> 29:54.896
I'm supposed to be 20 miles
northeast setting survey markers.

29:54.897 --> 29:57.274
Okay, maybe we should
stay here tonight.

29:57.275 --> 30:01.598
But we ought to get moving
early in the morning.

30:16.419 --> 30:17.752
Hey.

30:17.753 --> 30:19.671
Oh, what is it?

30:19.672 --> 30:21.840
'Morning.

30:21.841 --> 30:23.967
You hungry?

30:23.968 --> 30:26.386
Oh, yes.

30:26.387 --> 30:28.513
Good.

30:28.514 --> 30:31.141
They're gone! Where did they go?

30:31.142 --> 30:33.802
The creature, did it get them?

30:37.982 --> 30:41.694
Oh, they probably
just moved out early

30:41.861 --> 30:44.195
to check their trap lines,
that's all.

30:44.196 --> 30:45.405
Here.

30:45.406 --> 30:48.449
It's got to be a fast breakfast.
I want us out of here.

30:48.450 --> 30:50.950
Yes.

31:02.256 --> 31:04.756
Karin...

31:04.925 --> 31:07.343
...our visitors last night
were on foot.

31:07.344 --> 31:10.763
That means civilisation of
some kind can't be too far off.

31:10.764 --> 31:13.516
You'll be with your father in no time.

31:13.517 --> 31:16.017
Thank you, MacGyver.

31:17.688 --> 31:19.564
I'm sorry I was so afraid.

31:19.565 --> 31:22.900
Are you kidding? Did you
see me jump off that ship?

31:22.901 --> 31:24.735
I hit the water running.

31:24.736 --> 31:28.932
- But you took me with you.
- I needed company.

31:29.324 --> 31:31.824
Now hustle.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.875
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

31:41.044 --> 31:43.587
- Any sign of him?
- Nothing.

31:43.588 --> 31:45.506
Coffee's hot.

31:45.507 --> 31:48.040
Winslow just set number four.

31:48.593 --> 31:51.971
Oh, there's Sorenson. Now all
we need is Dockins to check in,

31:51.972 --> 31:54.640
and we can start putting
more pieces together.

31:54.641 --> 31:57.518
Things are still a standstill
in MacGyver's turf.

31:57.519 --> 31:59.562
Maybe he had some weather problem.

31:59.563 --> 32:02.106
Electrical disturbances
in the atmosphere

32:02.107 --> 32:05.693
- interfere with transmissions.
- I already checked that.

32:05.694 --> 32:09.280
Things up in MacGyver's
segment are crystal clear.

32:09.281 --> 32:11.699
Or should I say,
where he's supposed to be.

32:11.700 --> 32:15.119
- What do you mean by that?
- Face it, your man dropped the ball.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.079
He's probably out there fishing.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.415
I did notice he took
a fishing pole along.

32:19.416 --> 32:23.043
Did you also happen to notice that
he took next to no food or water?

32:23.044 --> 32:26.088
The man is an experienced
woodsman, he travels light,

32:26.089 --> 32:27.965
survives on what he can find.

32:27.966 --> 32:30.884
All right, maybe I'm out of line.
But answer me this.

32:30.885 --> 32:33.053
If he's the modern-day Daniel Boone,

32:33.054 --> 32:36.515
what is keeping him from reaching
that next marker location?

32:36.516 --> 32:39.016
I don't know.

32:49.612 --> 32:52.112
- Hear that?
- What?

32:52.281 --> 32:54.781
Listen.

32:54.826 --> 32:56.827
Oh, I hear. What, what is it?

32:56.828 --> 33:00.127
It's your ticket to Juneau.
Come on.

33:04.168 --> 33:05.377
People!

33:05.378 --> 33:08.630
Peel, you're holding me up.
How you coming with that pipe?

33:08.631 --> 33:14.386
I'd say that's part of the crew from
the Nanooket Pipeline. Come on.

33:14.387 --> 33:16.429
No! No!

33:16.430 --> 33:18.014
What?

33:18.015 --> 33:20.433
Those are the men from the ship!

33:20.434 --> 33:21.685
More welding rods.

33:21.686 --> 33:23.770
- The crew?
- Yes.

33:23.771 --> 33:26.272
I thought they were killed
by the creature.

33:26.273 --> 33:28.316
I want 'em.
Get that pipe hooked up.

33:28.317 --> 33:30.527
They look pretty healthy to me.

33:30.528 --> 33:34.239
But what are they doing here,
working on a pipeline?

33:34.240 --> 33:37.617
Not working, stealing.
They've tapped into the pipeline.

33:37.618 --> 33:39.953
They're pumping oil into the ship.

33:39.954 --> 33:41.538
They are stealing the oil?

33:41.539 --> 33:44.624
Ship's hold could be filled,
and they could be gone

33:44.625 --> 33:47.252
before anyone at the other end
figured it out.

33:47.253 --> 33:51.245
And that welding equipment?
Look at the glow.

33:51.757 --> 33:55.301
That explains the lights we saw
the other night to me.

33:55.302 --> 33:58.304
Okay. I've got an idea.
I want you to stay here.

33:58.305 --> 33:59.514
No! No, please.

33:59.515 --> 34:03.059
Karin, you'll be safer here
than anywhere else. Please.

34:03.060 --> 34:06.562
I've got to get in a position
to send a signal for help.

34:06.563 --> 34:09.065
I'll be back. I promise.

35:18.009 --> 35:21.231
Look what I found,
up on the ridge.

35:22.597 --> 35:25.432
Who are you? How did you get here?
Who brought you?

35:25.433 --> 35:27.933
No, I... I am lost!

35:28.061 --> 35:31.939
Hear that accent? She must have
been with the other one, the Russian.

35:31.940 --> 35:36.819
- There's more than you, isn't there?
- No, I... I am alone.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.071
A stowaway and a liar.

35:39.072 --> 35:41.240
What'll we do with her?

35:41.241 --> 35:44.182
I don't want any disruption here.

35:44.536 --> 35:47.829
Take her down the footpath
to the ship, with Murphy.

35:47.830 --> 35:49.414
Be sure she's safe.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.792
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

35:51.793 --> 35:53.669
What are you going to do with me?

35:53.670 --> 35:56.170
Move it.

36:04.972 --> 36:07.099
Do you have to kill her?

36:07.100 --> 36:11.423
- She's a little girl.
- She's a little witness.

36:53.979 --> 36:58.483
- Where are we going?
- The ship. Just keep moving.

37:09.536 --> 37:13.081
You are not taking me to the ship.
The ship is a long way from here.

37:13.082 --> 37:15.792
It's just up ahead. Now quiet.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.880
MacGyver!

37:29.681 --> 37:32.181
Come on!

37:36.897 --> 37:39.397
Tenon!

37:39.733 --> 37:42.903
Bench! It's Tenon! He's down!

37:43.570 --> 37:46.070
Come on, move it!

38:14.726 --> 38:16.435
Bench.

38:16.436 --> 38:18.479
Tenon's out cold.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.689
It's not important. She's gone!

38:20.690 --> 38:22.816
Never mind him. Find the girl!

38:22.817 --> 38:25.653
Murphy, go that way.
Peel, up through the trees!

38:25.654 --> 38:28.154
I knew she wasn't alone.

38:34.788 --> 38:36.914
What... What will we do?

38:36.915 --> 38:42.566
I'm gonna do what I started out
to do. Send a signal for help.

40:15.429 --> 40:16.638
What now?

40:16.639 --> 40:21.447
Now we find a place to wait
for the cavalry. Come on.

40:22.895 --> 40:26.355
Got here as soon as I could.
What have you got?

40:26.356 --> 40:28.941
Three of MacGyver's markers
just showed up.

40:28.942 --> 40:30.610
At the same time? Where?

40:30.611 --> 40:33.321
Now, look, this is the weird part.

40:33.322 --> 40:36.616
They moved at high speed
from here, about a hundred yards,

40:36.617 --> 40:39.243
- into this inlet here.
- You mean in the water?

40:39.244 --> 40:41.787
Well, either he's just
hooked a big one or...

40:41.788 --> 40:43.873
Or he's trying to tell us something.

40:43.874 --> 40:47.001
He's in trouble. What are
the exact coordinates there?

40:47.002 --> 40:49.253
A mile south of
the Nanooket Pipeline.

40:49.254 --> 40:53.382
Call the ranger station.
Tell them I'm flying up right away.

40:53.383 --> 40:57.602
I'll have a printout for you
in just a second.

40:59.014 --> 41:00.222
Where are we going?

41:00.223 --> 41:03.559
We'll try to get to the top of
the hill so he can see us better.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.060
- Who?
- A friend of mine.

41:10.192 --> 41:12.109
He should be on his way by now.

41:12.110 --> 41:15.921
- You're so certain.
- He's a good friend.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.369
Oh, boy!

43:02.094 --> 43:04.594
Let's go, take her down!

43:05.598 --> 43:07.640
Look out, MacGyver!

43:07.641 --> 43:10.141
Nail him!

43:42.009 --> 43:44.509
MacGyver!

43:46.096 --> 43:48.596
MacGyver!

43:51.643 --> 43:53.603
What is that?

43:53.604 --> 43:56.104
It's a long story, Pete.

44:07.492 --> 44:09.452
I wish that you
could come with me.

44:09.453 --> 44:12.496
I... I think my father would
very much like to meet you.

44:12.497 --> 44:15.583
Karin, I think my visit to Juneau
is gonna have to wait.

44:15.584 --> 44:20.254
I've got a little unfinished
business to take care of.

44:20.255 --> 44:22.755
Thank you, MacGyver.

44:25.427 --> 44:27.927
You're welcome.

44:38.148 --> 44:40.357
Chopper's ready in 1 5 minutes.

44:40.358 --> 44:42.860
Think you can get these
planted this time?

44:42.861 --> 44:48.532
Yes, ma'am. As long as I don't run into
any strange detours along the way.

44:48.533 --> 44:52.035
You didn't really fall for that guy
in the monkey suit, did you?

44:52.036 --> 44:55.747
I don't know. What with all the
evidence piling up over the years:

44:55.748 --> 44:59.282
Sightings, footprints,
stuff like that...

44:59.752 --> 45:02.254
Yeah, the guy had me
going for a while.

45:02.255 --> 45:04.799
Are you kidding? Bigfoot?

45:05.925 --> 45:09.405
Why not?
Legend has to start someplace.

45:14.517 --> 45:17.017
Pretty slick, huh?

45:17.020 --> 45:19.938
We found this connected
to the PA system on the ship.

45:19.939 --> 45:25.026
The pirates used it to give new life
to the sasquatch legend.

45:25.027 --> 45:27.527
The making of a legend?

45:28.305 --> 45:34.556
