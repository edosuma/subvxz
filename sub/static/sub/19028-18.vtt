WEBVTT

00:05.812 --> 00:08.042
<i>This saliva-heavy display
was because</i>

00:08.273 --> 00:10.582
<i>Keith was going out of town
for a few days.</i>

00:10.817 --> 00:12.614
Come on, Elliot.
Let me just borrow it for the weekend.

00:12.818 --> 00:14.013
I promise I'll bring it back.

00:14.196 --> 00:16.027
No, I need it. Now, go.

00:17.783 --> 00:20.092
Whenever he goes away,
he always wants to take my tushie.

00:20.327 --> 00:21.919
Why doesn't he just do what I did
when we were dating?

00:22.120 --> 00:24.554
Wait until you fall asleep naked
and take a picture of it.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.258
- Did you actually do that?
- No!

00:27.501 --> 00:29.617
<i>It's my screensaver.</i>

00:29.836 --> 00:32.350
Whenever we're apart,
I always get so bummed.

00:32.714 --> 00:34.909
Well, then let's get you
cheered up, huh?

00:35.133 --> 00:37.601
<i>Look what I just bought
in the back of Boys' Life,</i>

00:37.844 --> 00:39.436
Spider-Man goggles.

00:39.805 --> 00:42.478
Still gloomy? Let's put on the wipers.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.459
Nothing?

00:47.270 --> 00:48.669
Dr Beardface!

00:48.855 --> 00:50.925
Let's see if he wants to play Macaroni.

00:51.149 --> 00:53.105
How do you play?

00:54.903 --> 00:56.416
One-nothing, your turn.

00:56.988 --> 01:00.617
<i>Playing Macaroni was much more fun
than dealing with a hypochondriac.</i>

01:01.451 --> 01:02.964
I have chest tinglies.

01:03.161 --> 01:06.676
Lloyd, you're 40 years old
and you're a delivery man,

01:06.957 --> 01:09.346
so you should be suffering
from a pretty severe case

01:09.584 --> 01:12.815
of the where-did-I-go-wrongsies,
but other than that, you're fine.

01:13.088 --> 01:14.521
I ran every test.

01:15.173 --> 01:17.050
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:17.342 --> 01:19.094
But the pain starts here

01:19.302 --> 01:21.862
and then it goes along,
and then skips this area,

01:22.097 --> 01:26.136
and then starts hurting again here, and
then, of course, there's the tinglies.

01:30.021 --> 01:31.852
I'm gonna head out now, Lloyd.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.833
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

01:35.902 --> 01:38.097
I call next on Macaroni.

01:38.321 --> 01:39.390
He plays?

01:39.573 --> 01:41.689
Dr Kelso,
would you mind using your gum

01:41.908 --> 01:43.944
to show Elliot your mad 'oni skills?

01:49.374 --> 01:50.693
Man, he's good.

01:51.835 --> 01:53.666
You know, you really
cheered me up today.

01:53.879 --> 01:55.358
God, I feel like
we haven't really hung out all year.

01:55.547 --> 01:56.946
- I really miss it.
- I know.

01:57.132 --> 01:59.123
Well, your boyfriend's out of town.
Let's hang out tonight.

01:59.342 --> 02:02.220
Oh, I'd love to, but I've got dinner with
the partners and I've got to work late.

02:02.471 --> 02:03.426
Oh, that's too bad.

02:03.597 --> 02:06.430
<i>Since I was checking out
that kid's awesome plastic cow,</i>

02:06.683 --> 02:08.719
<i>I saw Elliot's friend first.</i>

02:10.103 --> 02:11.331
Elliot?

02:11.521 --> 02:13.432
Melody? Oh, my God!

02:14.483 --> 02:16.235
<i>And just like that, they regressed</i>

02:16.443 --> 02:19.833
<i>to the two 19-year-old
sorority sisters they had once been.</i>

02:20.113 --> 02:22.707
Dude, we should get out of here
before they look our way.

02:22.949 --> 02:23.904
Why?

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.794 --> 02:36.308
There's only one way to stop them!

02:36.546 --> 02:38.582
Show them the picture of Izzy!

02:38.799 --> 02:40.630
Go! Go!

02:45.597 --> 02:48.555
<i>Must show picture!</i>

02:54.314 --> 02:55.508
Girls?

02:56.942 --> 02:58.819
- Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.
- Yeah, it's been a while.

02:59.027 --> 03:00.301
- Good work.
- Hey.

03:00.487 --> 03:01.761
Hey, no, I lost mine.

03:16.572 --> 03:17.846
Thank you, Jerry.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.405
Hey, what's the deal
with Elliot's friend?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.209
Break her down for me, C-Bear.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.050
Okay, check it out. She and Elliot
went to college together, right?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.833
<i>Welcome to Turk's Booty Breakdown.</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:38.226
J.D., I gotta tell you,
I'm a huge fan of this chick.

03:38.469 --> 03:42.178
She seems smart, fun,
and she's got a little bit of a wild streak.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.772
Smack it and I'll do
a fake sexy "ooh" for you.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.338
Boys...

03:49.647 --> 03:50.602
Count it!

03:50.773 --> 03:53.048
Melody works as a
hotel reviewer for Zagat,

03:53.275 --> 03:56.073
has green eyes, perfect feet,
if you're into that.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.550
And here's the best part. Tell them!

03:59.990 --> 04:01.139
I'm single.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.444
Boo-yah!

04:03.619 --> 04:05.211
Bus Driver Dance us home.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.268
Driving, driving, passenger on.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.888
- Driving, driving, passenger on.
- Yeah!

04:11.794 --> 04:13.785
Why don't people dance
the Bus Driver any more?

04:14.004 --> 04:15.562
Because it's not a real dance.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.224
For us honkeys,
it's a very important dance.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.298
Driving, driving, inside the bus.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.229
Anyway, I know it's hard to believe,

04:22.429 --> 04:25.148
but when I first got to college,
I was a little bit of a...

04:25.391 --> 04:26.380
- Dork?
- Geek?

04:26.558 --> 04:28.833
Good-time Sally
who gave it away for free?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.431
I was the tramp, you old bitch.

04:31.814 --> 04:32.929
Liking her.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.366
You were so much fun.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.841
You know how Mel
got around campus?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.540
She'd just jump
on some random dude's back

04:38.737 --> 04:40.170
and then make him take her
wherever she wanted to go.

04:40.364 --> 04:43.037
Oh, remember that time
I made you do that with Grill Face?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.272
Yes!

04:44.493 --> 04:46.961
Come on, do it! Just pick a guy.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.555
- Go on!
- Okay.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.235
Let's go!

05:00.467 --> 05:02.503
I mean, before that happened,

05:02.720 --> 05:04.995
Grill Face's name was just Steve.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.663
Yeah.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.410
Why does this bed sheet
have two holes in it?

05:11.687 --> 05:14.679
That's on me.
Sometimes at night I haunt paediatrics.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.780
Yo, Mickhead, incoming.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.661
That is a double-bypass heart patient
with a ruptured spleen on the side.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.640
Hot damn.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.683
How come you don't ever give me
any of the good surgeries?

05:29.913 --> 05:32.381
I could do a bypass like... Done!

05:32.708 --> 05:35.347
Now, Gumball, that's hardly the point.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.585
The older surgical attendings
around here are warriors.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.830
Hell, if I screw with Mickhead,

05:41.050 --> 05:43.484
he'll send me
every bowel obstruction he gets.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.152
You, on the other hand,

05:45.346 --> 05:48.656
you're just not formidable enough
to have ever earned my respect.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.411
I don't even know
why I'm speaking with you.

05:50.601 --> 05:54.310
In fact, I'm going to stop talking
right in the middle of whatever I'm...

05:55.564 --> 05:57.236
Come on, Dr Cox, hook me up.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.579
You want a patient?

06:02.071 --> 06:03.026
Enjoy.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.844
Hey, weren't we
in an air band together?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.235
Maybe.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.688
I think so.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.836
Let's hit the town later.
I wanna roll with Nancy again.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.621
Who?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.189
That's the name
I gave her crazy wild side.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.580
I thought that was Jenji.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.878
No, Jenji's your super-sensitive,
neurotic side.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.213
You don't still think I'm neurotic,
do you?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.380
Because that would make me
so bummed. I mean,

06:31.558 --> 06:32.786
I thought that I'd done
so much work with all...

06:32.977 --> 06:34.296
Easy, Jenji.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.036
Breathe, breathe.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.890
Later.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.583
I thought you were too busy
to go out tonight.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.696
Please, it's Mel. I dropped everything.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.462
<i>She didn't do that for you.</i>

06:45.656 --> 06:48.489
God, it's so weird. She hasn't changed
at all since college.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.300
I love her for that.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.768
Hey, you can tag along if you want.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.148
<i>"Tag along"?</i>

06:53.330 --> 06:55.048
<i>Let her know you're upset,
but be subtle.</i>

06:55.249 --> 06:56.364
I'd love to.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.871
Okay, there's nothing wrong
with you, Lloyd.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.079
Your enzymes are negative,
you have a normal echo.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.509
Does heart trouble
even run in your family?

07:05.718 --> 07:07.117
Well, my uncle was shot in the heart.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.069
Okay, that helps.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.749
- Really?
- No.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.103
- Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Hey, it's okay.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.745
But now the Ghost That Hates Spills
is going to come.

07:21.984 --> 07:22.939
Who?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.943
You're right, Devin.
He might come this very night.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.439
And, as you know,
that ghost's entire family was killed

07:29.700 --> 07:32.260
by a careless spill, just like yours.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.353
Just like yours.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.373
Okay, this ends now.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.272
Do you know how messy kids can be,

07:42.463 --> 07:44.693
and how clean this place
has been ever since

07:44.923 --> 07:45.912
the ghost?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.844
And besides,
I'm only picking on the tonsil cases,

07:49.053 --> 07:51.203
the spoiled ones,
getting ice cream for every meal.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.819
Do you know what I had to eat
when I had my tonsils out?

07:54.058 --> 07:56.811
- What?
- Hot coffee and granola bars.

07:57.061 --> 07:59.177
Hot and scratchy, hot and scratchy!

07:59.647 --> 08:03.083
- Are you insane?
- I'm a little bit tired.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.031
I was up all night
learning to rollerblade.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.908
I want the ghost to be
a little bit more glide-y.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.561
Thanks, bro.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.899
Nice drink. Does it come in hetero?

08:21.085 --> 08:23.041
It does, but I didn't like it.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.937
Elliot's running 20 minutes late.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.122
You want to play darts
or maybe sing show tunes?

08:28.384 --> 08:30.500
<i>Don't say show tunes, it's a trap.</i>

08:31.011 --> 08:32.888
I mean, I guess we could make out.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.416
<i>Wait, what now?</i>

08:35.224 --> 08:37.897
Yeah, I know it's a little bit trampy,
but what the hell, so am I.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.532
The one thing I have tweaked
now that I'm an adult is,

08:40.770 --> 08:43.239
I mean, I'll mack anyone,
but that's where I draw the line.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.471
At macking?

08:44.650 --> 08:46.845
Yeah. And if you get too into it, I'll stop.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.670
- You want to think about it?
- What?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.908
<i>Well, this is fun.</i>

08:53.409 --> 08:55.400
- Hands at your side.
- Sorry.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.582
What the hell?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.782
He was turfed back to you from surgery
with endocarditis.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.240
Dr Turk said I was a present for you.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.654
Is he doing the Bus Driver?

09:16.098 --> 09:17.451
Yeah, dude.

09:18.434 --> 09:19.947
Don't get comfortable.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.455
"Aortic dissection"?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.142
"Pulmonary embolism"?

09:37.995 --> 09:38.950
No.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.983
"Splenic impart"?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.068
Hell, no!

09:47.963 --> 09:50.113
It's okay, I'll walk myself back.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.998
Heads up!

09:59.433 --> 10:01.583
Exciting news there, Milk Dud.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.687
I've convinced young Lloyd in there

10:03.896 --> 10:06.251
that the arm pain that he thought
was a heart attack

10:06.482 --> 10:08.234
is actually just what, Lloyd?

10:08.525 --> 10:09.844
Arm pain, Perry.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.144
A 100% surgical issue.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.333
It's O-V-E-R. I win.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.327
And, for your dignity's sake,

10:18.535 --> 10:21.129
please stop trying to play
with the big boys.

10:24.458 --> 10:28.451
<i>As I kissed Melody, knowing we were
headed somewhere amazing...</i>

10:29.171 --> 10:30.160
You moaned, we're done.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.897
No, no, no.
We're just macking, right back in.

10:32.091 --> 10:33.524
Where are your hands?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.039
In your pants.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.388
- Let's just put these there.
- All right.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.711
You know what's so amazing? It's like,

10:42.893 --> 10:46.932
I haven't seen Elliot in so long
and now she's this big-time doctor.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.665
I just wonder what she thinks,
you know, seeing me.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.573
<i>I was still mad at Elliot, so I said this.</i>

10:53.529 --> 10:55.804
She actually said she thought
it was a little weird

10:56.031 --> 10:57.942
that you haven't changed since college.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.228
<i>I left out that Elliot loved that.</i>

11:01.996 --> 11:02.985
Hey, guys!

11:03.747 --> 11:06.386
<i>We've all made
a few rash moves in our time.</i>

11:08.335 --> 11:09.848
Now it's really over.

11:10.421 --> 11:12.491
Oh, yeah? What did you do, kill him?

11:13.048 --> 11:15.198
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

11:15.801 --> 11:18.873
You said it was arm pain,
so I operated on his arm.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.311
But there was nothing wrong with him.
Are you crazy?

11:22.558 --> 11:25.072
Look, the man wanted something done,
I did it.

11:25.311 --> 11:26.983
End of story.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.743
Good day.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.259
<i>Ultimately, you have to hope</i>

11:31.442 --> 11:34.115
<i>your rash move doesn't cause
too many problems.</i>

11:34.361 --> 11:36.511
Okay, Jenji's wondering
whether or not her hair is working,

11:36.739 --> 11:39.378
but Nancy is ready to roll.
What's the plan?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.846
I'm sorry, I have to get going.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.845
Is she pissed at me?

11:45.039 --> 11:46.597
Why would she be pissed?

11:53.964 --> 11:56.842
- Hey, Elliot, are you and Melody okay?
- No.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.287
She wouldn't even tell me
why she's so pissed.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.864
God, it's so weird
how we always regress

12:01.055 --> 12:02.488
when we're with people from our past,
you know?

12:02.681 --> 12:04.000
I mean, she's being
just as passive-aggressive

12:04.183 --> 12:05.821
as she was when we were 19.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.013
I'm actually wishing she had
a boyfriend I could go mack with

12:09.229 --> 12:10.264
to get back at her.

12:10.439 --> 12:11.554
<i>Okay, this has gone far enough.</i>

12:11.732 --> 12:14.610
<i>You can't just mess up
Elliot and Melody's friendship.</i>

12:16.779 --> 12:19.691
<i>You have to come clean.
Tell her you started their fight.</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:21.832
I guess it doesn't really matter, anyway.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.433
I mean, she's already left town.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.337
<i>Or you can say nothing.</i>

12:25.537 --> 12:27.255
Well, since Keith is still gone,

12:27.456 --> 12:30.766
maybe we could use
that rain check tonight and hang out.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.498
Yeah.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.428
Thanks, I'd like that.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.502
Cool.

12:38.801 --> 12:39.790
Boo.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.108
That can't be good.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.726
Look, in this world,
when you're trying to settle a score,

12:47.935 --> 12:50.324
there's things you can do
and things you cannot do.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.999
Under no circumstances can you ever
perform unnecessary surgery

12:55.317 --> 12:57.308
just to unload an annoying patient.

12:58.529 --> 13:00.724
Did I get drunk last night
and send you an email

13:00.948 --> 13:02.620
asking for your opinion
about what I did?

13:02.825 --> 13:05.134
I don't know. I didn't check.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.803
Dr Turkleberry,
can you please explain to me

13:08.038 --> 13:10.347
why you performed surgery
on that patient?

13:10.624 --> 13:13.661
Better yet, you can tell it
to the ethics committee later on today.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.796
Maybe they'll just slap you
with a suspension,

13:16.005 --> 13:18.041
instead of taking away your licence.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.335
<i>That night, Elliot and I went out,
just the two of us.</i>

13:24.596 --> 13:26.075
Okay, how many beers?

13:26.890 --> 13:29.688
I'd say about eight
before she would do you.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.449
<i>Yeah, it was just like old times.</i>

13:33.605 --> 13:34.754
Hello, Elliot.

13:37.151 --> 13:39.745
Hit that thing.
It stops like that all the time.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.797
Hey, I'm the Fonz.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.007
- Did he see that?
- No.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.645
Good. Elliot, we're adults now.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.664
I don't want to behave the way
we used to, and I'm not leaving mad.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.475
I don't even know why you're mad.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.025
You told J.D. that it was weird
I haven't changed since college.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.028
Yeah, I said that I love that about you.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.484
Did I not mention that?

14:07.348 --> 14:09.782
What the hell are you doing?

14:10.017 --> 14:12.406
I'm reading Mr Gertner's chart,

14:12.936 --> 14:15.450
but if you'd like me to be more specific,

14:15.689 --> 14:19.284
I'm also standing, breathing,
thinking and now talking,

14:19.568 --> 14:23.322
which is actually preventing me
from what I was originally trying to do.

14:23.781 --> 14:27.171
Turk's career is in danger and you're
going to toss that attitude my way?

14:27.451 --> 14:29.009
I never asked him
to operate on that guy.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.239
No, you tortured him
into playing a game

14:31.455 --> 14:32.729
he shouldn't have been playing.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.985
Never mind that you and I are
supposed to be friends,

14:35.209 --> 14:36.688
and that I just had a baby
that I was hoping

14:36.877 --> 14:38.833
my husband would help support.

14:39.296 --> 14:42.368
What horrible thing did Turk do to
piss you off in the first place?

14:42.633 --> 14:44.510
He asked me to occasionally

14:46.303 --> 14:48.180
toss him a good surgery.

14:49.181 --> 14:52.730
Well, if he didn't apologise for that,
let me do it for him.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.736
He's so sorry.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.879
Don't worry about it.

15:05.364 --> 15:08.003
You know what? I should probably go.
It's late.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.224
Forgot to pay my cheque.

15:14.415 --> 15:16.565
- Here's a credit card for you.
- Thanks.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.602
It's quiet in here.
I think the music went off again.

15:23.841 --> 15:26.150
Someone want
to tap that jukebox for me?

15:26.677 --> 15:28.156
No? Okay.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.459
Wow, you guys can stare
an awfully long time

15:32.683 --> 15:35.197
without letting your eyes blink.
That's amazing. That's...

15:35.436 --> 15:37.108
I try and do that and I

15:38.397 --> 15:39.796
can never really

15:40.524 --> 15:41.673
do it,

15:41.942 --> 15:42.897
when I've tried.

15:43.068 --> 15:46.777
- Sorry, the, machine's busted.
- Unfortunate. Okay...

15:47.072 --> 15:49.222
Thank you, Frank. I will pay cash.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.145
Ben Franklin, here,
should take care of things.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.121
A $ 100 bill.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.308
I don't got change for that.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.058
He doesn't "got change,"
that's how he says that. Okay.

15:59.752 --> 16:02.266
Surely one of my lady friends could...

16:03.630 --> 16:05.427
No. All right, you know what?

16:05.632 --> 16:09.386
I'm going to pay $ 100
for that Appletini.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.509
I like you, you're a good barman.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.633
You never tease me
when I order the 'tinis.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.282
Drink them myself.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.744
Good night.

16:22.483 --> 16:24.872
I can't spend $ 100 on an Appletini,
it's absurd!

16:25.110 --> 16:26.987
That's like 10 'tinis, with a tip!

16:27.196 --> 16:28.595
No, there must be something else
that I can buy.

16:28.781 --> 16:31.136
How much is
that weird mounted fox tail?

16:31.617 --> 16:33.050
Actually, that's a beard.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.473
You'll probably keep that then.
Probably a family heirloom.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.820
You know what, Frank?
I'm going to do it.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.433
$ 100 for one Appletini

16:41.710 --> 16:43.860
that was, frankly, light on the 'tini.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.547
All right. Good night.

16:50.386 --> 16:51.978
- Found a fiver in my pocket.
- No.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.135
Okay. Keep that, too.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.861
Well, of course I'd like
to get to know you better.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.531
What is it, Perry?

17:04.191 --> 17:05.260
Bob,

17:06.234 --> 17:08.874
what I'm about to say is so painful,

17:09.113 --> 17:11.580
that I plan on erasing it
from my memory tonight

17:11.824 --> 17:13.701
by drinking a fifth of Jack
and challenging...

17:13.909 --> 17:16.423
One moment, Perry. I want to see this.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.328
Go ahead.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.375
I know that Gandhi messed up, I do.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.193
But I need you to let him off the hook.

17:28.424 --> 17:29.903
And why is that?

17:31.969 --> 17:34.608
Because I pushed him into it, okay?

17:35.806 --> 17:36.955
Or because he's a good person,

17:37.141 --> 17:39.530
or better yet,
because he's a good surgeon.

17:39.768 --> 17:42.157
Then I'll think about it. Bye-bye.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.768
<i>Sometimes, standing up for someone
still isn't enough</i>

17:46.984 --> 17:48.622
<i>to make the guilt go away.</i>

17:57.202 --> 17:58.635
That is cool.

17:59.413 --> 18:00.368
No scar!

18:04.501 --> 18:06.139
You never operated on him?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.317
But he said
he watched his own surgery.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.114
He thinks he did.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.655
I put up a divider,
sprayed on some local anesthetic

18:13.886 --> 18:16.559
and then put
Mrs Nawabi's heart surgery on the TV.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.636
What's that thing?

18:22.102 --> 18:23.660
That's your shoulder sack.

18:23.854 --> 18:24.843
Dude.

18:25.481 --> 18:27.199
You tricked me?

18:27.399 --> 18:29.196
I couldn't have done it
without my supporting players.

18:29.401 --> 18:33.280
Ladies and gentlemen, my muse,
my shining light,

18:33.572 --> 18:34.846
Miss Carla Turk.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.997
Stop being mean to my husband.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.872
And, of course, playing
the cantankerous Chief of Medicine,

18:43.123 --> 18:45.512
you know him, you love to hate him,

18:45.751 --> 18:49.300
Dr Bob Kelso!

18:59.848 --> 19:01.486
Again.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.415
That was fun.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.070
Don't mess with me ever again.

19:15.364 --> 19:18.834
- I'm so proud of you, baby.
- You know I do what I do...

19:23.414 --> 19:26.008
J.D., what the hell
were you doing in there?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.285
I don't know.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.448
I guess I was just pissed off

19:28.627 --> 19:30.777
because you cancelled your plans
for Melody but not for me.

19:31.005 --> 19:33.314
She was only in town
for a couple of days.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.905
I get it, I'm an idiot. It's just that, Elliot,

19:37.177 --> 19:39.896
when was the last time
we made any time for each other?

19:40.222 --> 19:42.258
We used to be so close

19:43.434 --> 19:45.789
and it just doesn't feel like
we are any more.

19:46.437 --> 19:49.952
Look, you know what it's like
when you're in a relationship.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.587
Not to mention work.
Plus, Turk's your best friend

19:52.818 --> 19:54.092
and Carla's my best friend.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.076
I want to be Turk's best friend
and your best friend.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.447
I just don't want to lose you.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.250
Then we'll both try harder.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.516
Take me over to them.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.310
Come on, now, mush!

20:11.503 --> 20:13.812
<i>I guess all relationships
have to evolve.</i>

20:14.131 --> 20:15.644
Gandhi, incoming!

20:16.634 --> 20:19.785
Mr Randolph's Nissen fundoplication
is all yours.

20:24.058 --> 20:27.289
<i>There's nothing you can do to stop it,
even if you wanted to.</i>

20:30.564 --> 20:31.838
Keith?

20:32.024 --> 20:35.300
Elliot, I didn't go home
to see my family.

20:36.862 --> 20:40.616
I went to see your father
to ask his permission to do this.

20:44.995 --> 20:47.555
Elliot, will you marry me?

20:51.001 --> 20:52.434
No way!

20:53.587 --> 20:55.782
<i>Yeah, such is life.</i>
