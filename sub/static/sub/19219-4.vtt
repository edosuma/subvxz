WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.212
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.712 --> 00:04.506
Based on the new data,
I'd say we have

00:05.215 --> 00:06.508
two months
of survivability.

00:06.716 --> 00:08.301
How many of us will
the ship sustain?

00:08.510 --> 00:09.386
No more
than a hundred.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.596
We just have to decide
who gets to live here.

00:11.805 --> 00:13.098
Arkadia
is just plan "B."

00:13.306 --> 00:14.474
It doesn't help
the grounders.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.226
I'm not stopping
until we have

00:16.434 --> 00:17.769
a solution
that saves everyone.

00:17.978 --> 00:20.271
If I'm on that list,
you're on that list.

00:20.605 --> 00:22.148
Write it down,
or I will.

00:22.649 --> 00:24.109
Bellamy,
I can't.

00:25.235 --> 00:27.696
Now we put it away and hope
we never have to use it.

00:27.904 --> 00:29.823
Nyko, what
happened to them?

00:30.031 --> 00:31.157
Sickness.

00:31.366 --> 00:32.826
We didn't treat her.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.286
Her body's rejecting
the radiation on its own.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.038
There's only one variable

00:37.247 --> 00:39.249
that separates Luna
from the others.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.084
Nightblood.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.229
Ha! He's awake!

01:02.814 --> 01:07.277
Hey, Jaha, it looks
like you got floated.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.904
So Jaha says we
need police here and here.

01:15.410 --> 01:16.828
Heh.

01:19.414 --> 01:20.874
Keeping yourself
busy, Mr. Jordan.

01:21.082 --> 01:24.836
Oh, I'm living it up,
every last day.

01:25.045 --> 01:26.337
Do I want to know
how you managed

01:26.546 --> 01:27.839
to do this without
waking me up?

01:28.048 --> 01:29.215
Oh, probably not,

01:29.424 --> 01:30.967
but the effects
are harmless,

01:31.176 --> 01:33.970
I promise, kind of.

01:39.768 --> 01:41.644
All right.
We've had our fun.

01:43.313 --> 01:44.731
Let's get
back to work.

01:57.619 --> 01:59.245
What's with the "we're
all gonna die" face?

02:02.248 --> 02:03.166
I mean--

02:03.750 --> 02:05.210
I know
what you mean.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.046
Bellamy should
be back by now.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.092
Hunting parties
go radio-silent.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.052
It's nothing new.

02:16.262 --> 02:17.305
What else?

02:20.141 --> 02:22.268
I just feel useless.

02:22.644 --> 02:25.063
I'm stuck here in case anyone
needs a cut bandaged,

02:25.271 --> 02:26.981
supervising the backup plan
when I should be

02:27.190 --> 02:28.608
going to the island
to make Nightblood.

02:28.817 --> 02:30.610
Clarke, you're not
a geneticist.

02:30.819 --> 02:31.903
Neither is my mom.

02:32.112 --> 02:33.655
Yeah. Well,
they have raven.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.156
Genetic code,
computer code.

02:35.365 --> 02:36.491
They'll
figure it out.

02:36.699 --> 02:38.493
Monty, I'm serious.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.036
So am I.

02:40.829 --> 02:42.080
If Jaha's right
and Becca

02:42.288 --> 02:43.540
created
Nightblood there,

02:43.790 --> 02:45.166
they'll find
her records,

02:45.667 --> 02:46.417
and all they
have to do

02:46.626 --> 02:48.336
is reverse-engineer
it from Luna.

02:48.545 --> 02:49.587
Everyone lives.

02:49.796 --> 02:50.421
If they
can get it done

02:50.630 --> 02:52.340
before the radiation
gets here.

02:54.592 --> 02:55.969
I guess we better
finish the ship.

02:59.139 --> 03:00.390
Riley,
how's it coming?

03:00.974 --> 03:01.975
We're on schedule here.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.018
We should have the radiation
patch up before dark.

03:04.936 --> 03:07.272
See? One less thing
to worry about.

03:15.071 --> 03:15.738
Black rain.

03:16.489 --> 03:17.115
All right.

03:17.323 --> 03:20.285
Everyone inside, just
like we practiced. Go.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.745
Sound the alarm!
This is not a drill!

03:25.165 --> 03:26.541
Move, move, move!

03:34.799 --> 03:36.134
Jasper! Come on!

03:39.345 --> 03:41.556
Jasper,
what are you doing?

03:42.265 --> 03:43.516
Can't live
your life in fear.

03:43.725 --> 03:45.226
Run!

03:47.687 --> 03:50.023
Monty, you can't.
You can't.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.066
Jasper!
Let me go.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.652
No!

04:00.158 --> 04:01.326
Clarke,
what do we do?

04:03.286 --> 04:07.290
The sky is...Falling.

04:07.498 --> 04:11.544
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
The sky is falling.

04:11.753 --> 04:14.589
Ha ha ha! Ha ha!

04:14.797 --> 04:16.966
Whoo! Ha ha!

04:17.175 --> 04:18.593
What is wrong with you?

04:18.801 --> 04:22.263
It's just rain,
not radioactive ash.

04:22.639 --> 04:25.099
Dude, not cool.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.938
Come on. It's a joke.
Don't be like that, guys.

04:30.146 --> 04:30.939
Guys!

04:33.900 --> 04:36.653
When did everyone around here
lose their sense of humor?

05:17.694 --> 05:18.778
Abby,
if you're right,

05:18.987 --> 05:21.739
then Luna's
the miracle we need.

05:21.948 --> 05:23.491
I wish I were
with you.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.619
Abby, on radio: Me, too,
but you have to be there.

05:26.828 --> 05:28.204
Once we create
this Nightblood serum,

05:28.413 --> 05:30.206
we're gonna have to
distribute it very quickly,

05:30.415 --> 05:32.917
and we need peace
for that.

05:34.294 --> 05:36.796
I have to go.
Stay safe, Abby.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.090
Be in touch when
you find the lab.

05:39.841 --> 05:43.177
I will.
You stay safe, too.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.397
Have a seat.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.692
What did I do now?

06:00.445 --> 06:02.322
Rumors of the flame's
destruction are spreading.

06:02.697 --> 06:04.907
People on the street openly
call for the king's head.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.327
Your choices
have consequences.

06:07.702 --> 06:09.370
Would you rather
I killed Indra's daughter?

06:09.579 --> 06:11.372
I'd rather
you didn't kill.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.917
Our mission is to keep
Roan on the throne,

06:15.126 --> 06:16.294
to buy time
for the others

06:16.502 --> 06:18.546
to find a way to save us
from the radiation.

06:18.755 --> 06:19.714
I'm doing that.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.008
By decapitating
an innocent boy.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.219
Everyone's guilty
of something.

06:26.721 --> 06:28.598
There's a darkness
in you, Octavia.

06:29.182 --> 06:30.558
I know you're
still mourning.

06:31.017 --> 06:32.268
Sit down.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.360
You didn't have
to kill that boy.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.820
You didn't have to kill
ambassador Rafel.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.366
You didn't
have to kill pike.

06:47.784 --> 06:49.660
Pike got
what he deserved.

06:49.869 --> 06:52.163
Justice and vengeance
are not the same thing.

06:52.372 --> 06:53.623
To me, they are.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.047
Your decision-making
has grown

07:01.255 --> 07:02.799
increasingly
questionable,

07:03.007 --> 07:04.801
and I can't have my
people going rogue.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.427
"Rogue."
I'm a warrior.

07:06.636 --> 07:08.888
No. A warrior knows
when not to kill.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.349
Lincoln
taught you that.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.601
You seem to have
forgotten.

07:14.769 --> 07:16.187
You're right that we
have a job to do here,

07:16.938 --> 07:17.897
and right now,
you're making it

07:18.106 --> 07:19.190
more difficult.

07:21.526 --> 07:25.571
Chancellor Kane,
the king would like to see you.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.159
You're no longer part
of my security detail.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.291
I had Helios
saddled for you.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.043
The ride home
will do you good.

07:39.252 --> 07:40.878
I'm not going anywhere
before I talk to Indra.

07:41.087 --> 07:42.422
Suit yourself.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.465
She'll be here
soon enough.

07:44.674 --> 07:46.342
After you.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.750
Where are the boats?

08:20.001 --> 08:22.336
Without Alie, there's
no reason to be here.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.839
According
to Thelonious' map,

08:25.882 --> 08:27.675
the lab is in
the middle of the island,

08:28.843 --> 08:30.553
5 Miles straight ahead.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.933
You OK
for that hike?

08:36.142 --> 08:38.060
Try to keep up
with me.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.812
Never thought
I'd be here again.

08:40.021 --> 08:41.856
Ah, you shouldn't
have come.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.858
You're not fooling
anyone, Murphy.

08:44.484 --> 08:45.568
You're still a dick.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.424
Luna, Nyko, time to move.

09:23.439 --> 09:24.815
I said, let's go.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.834
What's wrong?

09:44.627 --> 09:47.838
Alie's rules--
no Frikdreina past this line.

09:49.215 --> 09:50.466
I've never crossed it.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.343
Frikdreina?

09:53.553 --> 09:54.804
Mutants.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.431
I never met a line
I wouldn't cross.

10:03.062 --> 10:04.981
All right, everyone.
Let's go.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.983
We have a long walk
ahead of us.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.118
Let's move.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.002
What is that?

10:27.753 --> 10:28.379
Drone?

10:28.588 --> 10:29.463
We should run.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.340
Why? What's the penalty
for crossing the line?

10:33.050 --> 10:35.052
- Run!
- Run!

10:35.261 --> 10:36.304
I thought
you said Alie was down.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.431
She is.
It's probably automated.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.515
Raven.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.100
I can't keep up.

10:41.309 --> 10:42.810
I got you. Cover Luna.
Cover Luna!

10:43.728 --> 10:45.438
Move! Move!

10:45.646 --> 10:48.691
I got her.
Go, go, go, go, go.

10:51.235 --> 10:55.197
Get down.
Emori, are you OK?

11:00.578 --> 11:02.163
- Nyko, no!
- You can't help him.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.957
- Nyko. Nyko!
- It's too late.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.628
No.

11:09.754 --> 11:10.379
Nyko.

11:11.505 --> 11:15.551
- Luna, take cover!
- Nyko. No! No!

11:21.849 --> 11:23.225
Well, that
took you 10 shots.

11:23.976 --> 11:24.727
Alie's got
dozens of drones.

11:24.935 --> 11:25.561
Who do you think's
gonna run

11:25.770 --> 11:26.771
out of bullets
first, huh?

11:26.979 --> 11:29.106
Could we talk about why
they're still in the sky?

11:32.151 --> 11:35.529
No.
Where the hell's Luna?

11:45.122 --> 11:45.998
They're back.

11:46.207 --> 11:48.626
We can see that,
Jackson. Here's the deal.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.586
If we don't find Luna,
then everybody we know

11:50.795 --> 11:53.714
is gonna die in a wave of fire,
so we split up.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.092
Murphy, Emori, Abby,
go west.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.843
Wilson, Taggart.
You got east.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.261
Jackson and I
will go north,

11:59.470 --> 12:01.305
and...Raven...

12:02.807 --> 12:04.392
- I like the beach.
- Stay under the trees.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.560
You're safe here, OK?
Rest of you do the same.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.436
Let's check in
every 10.

12:08.479 --> 12:09.605
It's still active.

12:09.814 --> 12:11.524
One problem
at a time, raven.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.192
Let's move out.

12:13.401 --> 12:14.652
I'll take up
the back.

12:23.828 --> 12:25.079
We shouldn't be in
this forest, John.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.622
We need to cut
our losses.

12:26.831 --> 12:27.707
Why?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.418
Hey, what are you
not telling me?

12:32.628 --> 12:34.296
Just trust me.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.882
There are worse things
on this island than drones.

12:37.383 --> 12:38.467
We're safer
at your bunker.

12:38.676 --> 12:39.635
It's not stocked.

12:39.844 --> 12:40.594
I told you,
I ate everything.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.138
So we restock it.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.181
You said it was
big enough for two.

12:45.558 --> 12:49.687
Is everything OK?
We need to keep moving.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.501
Is there a reason we're
meeting in the embassy?

13:13.669 --> 13:15.421
- I would have thought--
- tell me the plan.

13:16.422 --> 13:17.089
The plan?

13:17.298 --> 13:18.966
It's been 3 weeks
since Clarke told me

13:19.175 --> 13:21.761
Praimfaya would once again
destroy our world.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.889
Skaikru asked for time
to find a solution.

13:26.015 --> 13:27.433
What do you have
to show for it?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.560
We're still
working on it.

13:29.769 --> 13:33.773
- Hopefully, with more time--
- enough. Echo.

13:36.609 --> 13:41.530
Stephens, Bellamy,
are you all right? What is this?

13:42.281 --> 13:44.325
Echo saw your people
rebuilding your ship.

13:44.784 --> 13:47.036
She captured these two
hunting in my woods.

13:47.912 --> 13:50.372
This one says it's
a shelter from the radiation.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.962
It's a backup plan,
nothing more.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.841
He said that, too,
just before he told us

14:01.050 --> 14:02.593
that you have
a Nightblood.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.348
It's a good thing
the flame's been destroyed,

14:07.556 --> 14:10.267
or I'd be worried you're
planning an ascension.

14:10.476 --> 14:12.061
You have
to trust me.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.479
We discovered
that Nightblood

14:13.687 --> 14:16.148
helps metabolize
radiation.

14:17.358 --> 14:18.651
We're investigating
ways to create it

14:18.859 --> 14:19.819
for everyone,

14:20.402 --> 14:22.988
turn everyone
into Nightbloods

14:23.197 --> 14:24.532
so we can all
survive.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.200
Blasphemy.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.993
Nothing they
tell us is true.

14:28.202 --> 14:31.789
This is. It's not blasphemy.
It's--it's science.

14:32.832 --> 14:34.708
If Nightblood
can save lives,

14:35.042 --> 14:36.377
we should use it.

14:49.139 --> 14:52.268
- Agh...
- No! No! No.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.646
Warriors don't
reveal their secrets.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.357
No.

14:58.566 --> 15:01.485
Truth is the first
causality of war.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.279
If your motives
were pure,

15:03.487 --> 15:06.073
you would've shared
your plan with me.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.075
Our alliance is broken.

15:15.916 --> 15:16.750
No.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.962
Listen to me. No! No!

15:22.673 --> 15:23.591
No!

15:24.258 --> 15:25.551
No!

15:26.552 --> 15:27.678
No!

15:38.272 --> 15:39.565
I can't believe you
talked me into this.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.901
Come on.
You saw Clarke.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.445
She needs to chill out.
We're doing her a favor.

15:45.738 --> 15:47.781
Fire-suppression foam
is almost gone,

15:47.990 --> 15:51.577
but there should be enough left
in the pipes for one shot.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.331
It's gonna be epic.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.166
I need something to pry
the keypad open.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.460
Uh...Oh.

16:01.587 --> 16:02.671
Hmm?

16:03.464 --> 16:05.466
Phew. Oh. Nice.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.093
I already wrote
the program.

16:08.302 --> 16:09.803
It should only
take a second.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.349
Heh, remember
the time we welded

16:13.557 --> 16:15.351
your dad's furniture
to the ceiling?

16:15.643 --> 16:17.603
That was a prank.

16:17.811 --> 16:21.649
Uh, why does Clarke have
a list of 100 names?

16:31.825 --> 16:34.119
Let's go. She's gonna
be back any second.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.206
- What is this?
- Just put it away.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.874
Monty, talk to me.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.001
- Give it to me.
- Hey, what--

16:42.294 --> 16:43.671
what's going on?

16:44.171 --> 16:46.131
I know you know
something.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.176
The ship will only
save 100 people.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.096
Guess Clarke
made a list.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.562
- You didn't tell me?
- Clarke has a plan.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.856
Clarke lied
to our faces.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.442
She didn't--didn't tell you
she was making a list.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.194
- Now you're defending her?
- What do you care?

17:07.987 --> 17:09.780
You've made it clear
you're planning to die,

17:09.989 --> 17:10.823
planning to
leave me alone.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.867
Which is my choice,
not Clarke's.

17:15.536 --> 17:16.829
She put herself
on this list, by the way.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.247
You still think
it's all good?

17:18.455 --> 17:19.957
Look. I'm sure
she has a reason.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.835
Ohh, Clarke's deciding
who's worth saving.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.587
That--that
is just great.

17:28.924 --> 17:32.636
Guess what, Monty.
You're not.

17:33.846 --> 17:34.722
What?

17:34.972 --> 17:36.390
See for yourself.

17:39.018 --> 17:40.561
Clarke thinks
you're expendable.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.273
Clarke, wait.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.319
Really?

17:51.280 --> 17:52.281
I found your list.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.575
I guess we know
who really matters to you.

17:55.284 --> 17:56.410
J--Jasper--

17:56.618 --> 17:57.494
you're not God, Clarke.

17:57.703 --> 17:58.871
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.539
The list is a backup.
We have a--

18:00.748 --> 18:02.207
well, I guess you don't mind
if I tell everyone, then, right?

18:02.416 --> 18:03.459
- Jasper, no.
- Please--

18:03.667 --> 18:04.585
People have
a right to know

18:04.793 --> 18:05.878
that they're working
for nothing.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.880
Is there a fire?
Everything all right?

18:09.048 --> 18:10.174
Not for you.

18:10.382 --> 18:11.550
You're not
on the list.

18:11.884 --> 18:12.801
What list?

18:13.594 --> 18:14.511
Attention, Arkadia.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.763
I have an announcement
that could affect--

18:15.971 --> 18:17.056
aah!

18:21.727 --> 18:23.687
Jasper, you OK?
Jasper.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.397
He broke into
the chancellor's office.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.399
Lock him up.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.820
I'm acting on the authority
of chancellor Kane.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.572
Take him
into custody.

18:36.784 --> 18:37.868
Get him
out of here.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.039
Uhh!

18:44.583 --> 18:45.334
Let's go.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.634
- Monty, it--
- don't.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.929
Just...Don't.

19:27.543 --> 19:28.502
Indra.

19:32.798 --> 19:33.507
No.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.260
Indra. Indr--

19:44.852 --> 19:46.436
Uh! Uh...

19:47.688 --> 19:49.356
Skairipa...

20:34.401 --> 20:35.986
Monty--

20:36.195 --> 20:38.655
Jasper's fine,
in case you care.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.366
I do care.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.785
Can we talk
in private, please?

20:53.420 --> 20:56.131
It wasn't easy
making that list.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.842
I only had so many
slots for engineers.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.719
You're an apprentice.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.721
Jaha's more knowledgeable
about the ship.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.557
He's more experienced,
and raven I--

21:06.975 --> 21:08.310
that's what you
think this is about?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.938
Clarke, I get

21:11.146 --> 21:12.773
why you didn't
put me on the list.

21:13.607 --> 21:14.566
I may have even
agreed with it.

21:14.775 --> 21:17.778
It's just,
who are you?

21:18.278 --> 21:20.113
When did you
become this person?

21:21.240 --> 21:22.908
I haven't
become anyone.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.409
The Clarke I know
wouldn't be

21:24.618 --> 21:26.036
arresting
her friends.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.081
Kane agreed that we
needed to keep this quiet.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.084
Kane isn't here.
That's just an excuse.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.543
You're the one
saying, you live

21:33.752 --> 21:34.795
and Harper dies.

21:35.254 --> 21:36.797
You're the one
shock-batoning Jasper,

21:37.422 --> 21:38.507
then arresting him.

21:38.715 --> 21:39.800
You're the one
going too far

21:40.008 --> 21:41.468
and using the same
old justification--

21:41.677 --> 21:42.886
"it's all
for my people."

21:43.095 --> 21:44.179
It is.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.474
I know you think people
will freak out,

21:47.933 --> 21:50.185
but if you just tell
everyone the truth,

21:51.478 --> 21:52.980
maybe they'll
surprise you.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.027
Monty, it's too risky.

22:02.281 --> 22:05.450
Jasper was right.
You're not God.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.714
Monty, on P.A.:
I have an announcement to make.

22:19.631 --> 22:22.134
Clarke Griffin
has been lying to you.

22:22.342 --> 22:22.968
No.

22:23.135 --> 22:25.262
Arkadia will only
save 100 people.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.766
Who thinks
they made the list?

22:31.518 --> 22:33.603
"Abby Griffin,

22:33.812 --> 22:35.522
"Eric Jackson,

22:35.939 --> 22:37.858
"Thelonious Jaha,

22:38.400 --> 22:39.943
"Raven Reyes,

22:40.152 --> 22:42.112
"Octavia Blake,

22:42.821 --> 22:44.031
"Jim Bruder,

22:44.239 --> 22:45.907
"Heather David,

22:46.116 --> 22:47.868
"Grazia Watson,

22:48.368 --> 22:49.745
"Danny Vertue,

22:50.287 --> 22:51.830
"Sarah Soderquist,

22:52.331 --> 22:53.707
"Susan Crawford,

22:54.583 --> 22:55.584
Shelley Skerritt..."

23:07.846 --> 23:09.765
You can't fly,
but you can talk.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.396
Ah! Uh!

23:18.899 --> 23:21.109
Ah! Uh!

23:22.986 --> 23:25.113
Miller, on radio:
Raven, report. Are you OK?

23:27.616 --> 23:30.619
All good here. Worry
about your damn self.

23:35.415 --> 23:36.416
Ohh...

23:38.210 --> 23:39.795
Luna no!
You'll get killed!

23:45.050 --> 23:46.593
Luna's here.
She's heading for the boat.

23:47.135 --> 23:47.886
Miller, on radio:
Copy that, raven.

23:48.095 --> 23:48.845
Do whatever you can
to stop her.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.347
We're on our way.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.349
Screw it. Uh!

24:05.946 --> 24:08.907
I can't let you leave.
We need you.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.617
I've heard
that before.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.832
So I am a prisoner.

24:19.668 --> 24:23.130
Your blood can
save us, everyone.

24:23.713 --> 24:26.216
Do you really think you
deserve to be saved?

24:27.426 --> 24:29.386
I know how
you feel, OK?

24:30.011 --> 24:33.181
I get it, but it won't
always be like this.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.476
You just have
to keep fighting.

24:37.853 --> 24:39.354
What if the fight
is all we are?

24:40.647 --> 24:44.317
We torture, kill,
betray.

24:45.235 --> 24:46.319
We pretend we're
more than that

24:46.528 --> 24:48.196
just to make ourselves
feel better,

24:48.947 --> 24:50.240
but it's a lie.

24:52.576 --> 24:54.077
What about
the child--

24:56.163 --> 24:57.164
Adria?

24:57.914 --> 24:59.332
Was she more
than that?

25:02.502 --> 25:05.881
Adria's gone.
They're all gone.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.175
But she was good,

25:09.468 --> 25:10.760
wasn't she?

25:12.554 --> 25:15.557
There are others
like her out there.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.311
Don't you want
to give them a chance?

25:29.821 --> 25:31.448
You're not
a prisoner, Luna.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.493
You have a choice.

25:38.246 --> 25:39.706
Miller, on radio: Raven,
we can't get to the beach.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.833
Taking fire
in the north woods.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.502
Jackson's hit.
I'm low on ammo.

25:43.710 --> 25:44.461
Put pressure on it.

25:44.669 --> 25:45.629
Abby, on radio: What do
you mean, Jackson's hit?

25:45.837 --> 25:46.630
Is he OK?

25:46.838 --> 25:47.631
I think so.

25:47.839 --> 25:49.007
He took one in the arm,
and we're pinned down.

25:49.216 --> 25:50.175
We're on our way.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.259
Luna's
the priority!

25:51.468 --> 25:52.969
Nothing's more
important than her.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.477
We need to help them.
Luna, please.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.854
I know what to do,
but my leg--

26:04.439 --> 26:06.650
look. I can't
do it myself.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.240
What do I need
to do?

26:19.579 --> 26:21.206
Are you sure
about this?

26:21.498 --> 26:22.332
I'm sure.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.043
If you can get it,
I can hack it.

26:44.187 --> 26:46.356
Run. Luna!
Use the trees!

26:57.534 --> 27:00.078
Run, Luna! Go!
Go, go, go!

27:09.087 --> 27:10.171
You're up.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.339
Miller, on radio:
Still taking fire.

27:11.548 --> 27:12.716
Abby, on radio:
We're almost there.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.092
Save your friends.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.512
I just need to access
its core programming.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.685
The drones are
protecting Alie's facilities

27:23.893 --> 27:25.270
like guard dogs.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.105
Can you stop them?

27:28.815 --> 27:29.899
We need you, Abby.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.485
Yeah. There
must be a way.

27:32.694 --> 27:33.820
We can see you.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.618
I can't see it.

27:40.744 --> 27:41.995
I'll draw
its fire.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.121
What the hell
are you doing?

27:43.330 --> 27:44.331
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

27:44.539 --> 27:45.790
When they come
for me, shoot them.

27:47.876 --> 27:49.794
- Hey! Over here.
- Abby...

27:54.466 --> 27:55.467
Abby, run!

28:04.893 --> 28:06.978
The drones just fell
out of the sky.

28:07.896 --> 28:09.022
What happened?

28:09.898 --> 28:11.024
I happened.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.359
Now get your asses
back to the boat.

28:12.567 --> 28:13.902
Luna's here. Over.

28:21.743 --> 28:22.952
Luna.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.208
It's not your blood
that defines you.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.043
It's your heart.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.095
I didn't
survive the ice nation

28:40.303 --> 28:43.014
just to die because you
think I'm not good enough.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.433
Riley, you're smart,
but you were training

28:45.642 --> 28:47.018
to be a guard
on the ark.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.687
We only need
so many soldiers.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.355
You're telling me
that Darcy

28:50.563 --> 28:51.773
is more qualified
than me?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.900
She's a trainee, too,
and I'm a hell

28:54.109 --> 28:55.985
of a lot better shot,
no offense.

28:56.194 --> 28:58.071
I know this is
hard to take in,

28:58.738 --> 29:00.156
but to ensure
the survival

29:00.365 --> 29:01.991
of the human race,
the list had to be

29:02.200 --> 29:03.034
weighted towards
young women

29:03.243 --> 29:04.077
who can have
children.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.245
Wait. What?

29:05.453 --> 29:07.122
It's because she
can have kids?

29:07.330 --> 29:08.206
How's that fair?

29:08.415 --> 29:10.417
It's not fair.
It's smart.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.544
Yeah?
What about Harper?

29:16.715 --> 29:17.632
There's a chance
she could be

29:17.841 --> 29:19.384
a drain on
medical resources.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.344
Well, I'm not sick.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.471
Not yet.

29:24.889 --> 29:25.932
Your dad.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.227
You went into
her medical records?

29:29.728 --> 29:30.562
You're
condemning me

29:30.770 --> 29:32.647
for an illness that
I might have someday?

29:33.773 --> 29:34.941
I had to
consider all variables.

29:35.483 --> 29:36.234
That's rich
for a person

29:36.443 --> 29:37.527
who put herself
on the list.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.320
And Bellamy Blake?
Come on.

29:39.654 --> 29:42.866
Of course Clarke
and Bellamy should be included.

29:46.286 --> 29:49.205
Strong leadership is
essential for survival.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.626
All right.
You don't like the list.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.677
Consider it shredded.

30:03.136 --> 30:05.513
Now, we can keep
fighting each other and die,

30:06.055 --> 30:07.390
or we can work together

30:08.141 --> 30:10.894
and give everyone
a shot at survival,

30:12.103 --> 30:12.854
your choice.

30:13.521 --> 30:14.272
Meaning what?

30:14.481 --> 30:17.025
We hold a lottery,
randomly choose

30:17.233 --> 30:19.277
The 100 people
to survive,

30:20.028 --> 30:22.280
but you have to work for it
every day.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.532
You don't show up
for your assignments,

30:25.325 --> 30:26.868
you can't be
in the lottery,

30:27.243 --> 30:30.121
and when the time comes,
we'll collect the names,

30:31.289 --> 30:32.457
and we draw.

30:34.542 --> 30:35.168
Good?

30:36.961 --> 30:37.796
Good?

30:39.464 --> 30:40.757
Then it's settled.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.802
Now, that radiation
shield is ready.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.763
Who's gonna help me
put it in place?

30:50.767 --> 30:51.684
Let's get it done.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.358
Hey, wait.

31:01.736 --> 31:02.654
What are you doing?

31:03.196 --> 31:04.072
Helping.

31:05.657 --> 31:07.242
I'm not trying to
undermine you, Clarke.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.119
You have to know that
a random lottery is risky.

31:10.537 --> 31:11.913
We could end up
with no doctors,

31:12.121 --> 31:12.997
no engineers.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.040
You saw that we
have to give them

31:14.249 --> 31:15.416
something
to fight for.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.418
We can't tell people
they have no value.

31:18.670 --> 31:19.671
That's not
what I said.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.506
That's what
they heard.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.135
The list
was pragmatic,

31:27.512 --> 31:28.596
but the people
need to feel like

31:28.805 --> 31:30.640
they have a say
in their fate.

31:32.475 --> 31:33.935
I hope you're right.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.104
Heh.

31:48.825 --> 31:49.951
Faster, Helios!

32:14.309 --> 32:15.894
- Yah.
- Yah.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.275
Stop her!

32:48.968 --> 32:51.471
Huh! Uh! Huh!

32:51.971 --> 32:54.140
It's over, Octavia.
Don't fight it.

32:54.641 --> 32:57.226
Roan wants you alive.
Come quietly.

32:57.518 --> 32:58.436
That'll happen.

33:00.313 --> 33:01.606
- Huh!
- Ohh!

33:02.148 --> 33:02.899
Uh!

33:10.323 --> 33:11.157
Ah!

33:12.241 --> 33:14.160
Uh! Yah! Uh!

33:25.004 --> 33:26.255
Doesn't have
to be this way.

33:26.464 --> 33:28.633
It does. You made
sure of that.

33:29.467 --> 33:30.343
Rrgh!

33:30.551 --> 33:32.178
- Uh! Uh!
- Ah!

33:42.522 --> 33:44.107
- Uh!
- Ah!

33:46.943 --> 33:48.611
Ah! Uh...

33:52.281 --> 33:53.908
- Uh!
- Uh!

34:02.208 --> 34:03.835
I said,
I wanted you alive.

34:35.950 --> 34:36.826
Uh...

35:13.404 --> 35:14.906
I shouldn't
have locked you up.

35:15.615 --> 35:17.950
I thought it was
the only choice I had.

35:19.035 --> 35:21.120
It was the only choice
you gave yourself.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.417
If you think you
have the best idea,

35:27.418 --> 35:29.420
you have to
convince people,

35:30.129 --> 35:31.214
not lie to them

35:33.049 --> 35:34.675
or lock them up.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.137
That doesn't
matter now.

35:39.222 --> 35:41.015
Monty read the list
over the radio.

35:41.849 --> 35:43.392
Everyone
knows everything.

35:43.601 --> 35:44.977
What a shame.

35:45.686 --> 35:48.022
You were giving Jaha a
run for his money there,

35:48.856 --> 35:50.316
Jaha lite.

35:51.776 --> 35:54.403
You know, he used to be
everything that I hated.

35:57.365 --> 35:59.617
Maybe he was
keeping us together.

36:02.411 --> 36:05.498
When Jaha's
looking reasonable,

36:05.706 --> 36:06.791
it's time
to reassess.

36:10.878 --> 36:11.838
You can go.

36:14.715 --> 36:19.053
You know, someday
when all this is over,

36:20.513 --> 36:21.764
you're gonna realize

36:23.891 --> 36:25.560
that foam bit
was funny.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.320
We getting
close, Dr. Griffin?

36:37.655 --> 36:39.115
It's just
through there.

36:39.657 --> 36:40.616
Let's go.

36:41.492 --> 36:42.743
Yep.

36:45.454 --> 36:48.624
Luna, I'm sorry
about Nyko.

36:48.958 --> 36:49.959
Me, too.

36:51.294 --> 36:53.713
Hey, about, uh,
what happened

36:53.921 --> 36:56.716
at the beach,
thank you.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.344
Careful, Reyes.

37:00.761 --> 37:02.597
Emori's already
got dibs on me.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.779
Uh, small question.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.616
Alie had a security system
to protect this thing, right?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.910
Any idea what she
was protecting it from?

37:25.786 --> 37:27.622
Let's hope
we don't find out.

37:28.623 --> 37:30.333
Just in case, raven,
get the drones

37:30.541 --> 37:32.210
back into the sky.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.549
Auxiliary power
initiated.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.086
Not bad, Becca.

38:26.055 --> 38:27.640
Doesn't matter
what we do.

38:28.391 --> 38:31.185
Always end up here--
the brink of war.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.480
Abby's on
the island.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.775
She'll find a cure.
I know she will.

38:39.986 --> 38:41.028
Hey...

38:42.697 --> 38:44.031
We will get
through this.

38:57.128 --> 38:58.587
On your feet.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.382
What are you doing?

39:04.218 --> 39:05.678
We're bringing you home.

39:06.637 --> 39:08.681
Your ship is shelter
from Praimfaya,

39:08.889 --> 39:10.391
so I intend to take it.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.021
You don't
have to do this.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.149
We can find a
solution together.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.942
That time
has passed.

39:20.985 --> 39:21.944
Get them ready
to march.

39:22.153 --> 39:24.071
Octavia
will get there first.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.617
She'll warn them you're coming.
You'll lose.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.193
She wouldn't
be taken alive.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.655
No. No.

40:06.864 --> 40:07.823
I am sorry.

40:11.369 --> 40:12.870
It was a good death.

40:13.079 --> 40:15.331
Ohh...

40:22.421 --> 40:26.884
Oh, my--no!

40:27.468 --> 40:30.304
No!

40:30.513 --> 40:33.808
Waah! No!

40:34.767 --> 40:37.645
No! Uhh!

40:38.145 --> 40:39.438
No!

41:03.838 --> 41:04.797
Uh...

41:14.348 --> 41:15.266
Helios.

41:17.393 --> 41:18.686
Uh...

41:23.816 --> 41:24.817
Uh!

41:26.652 --> 41:28.195
Uhh...

41:31.699 --> 41:32.408
Uh!

41:35.244 --> 41:36.120
Uhh!

41:39.540 --> 41:42.376
Home, Helios.

41:42.793 --> 41:44.044
Take me home.
