From beautiful downtown Malibu,

00:03.086 --> 00:06.798
it's time for everyone's favorite game:

00:06.881 --> 00:09.426
What Do Ya Know??

00:09.509 --> 00:11.594
A game that answers the question,

00:11.678 --> 00:14.889
how well do you really
know your roommates?

00:14.973 --> 00:18.810
For example, I can tell by the way
Frankie is glaring at me right now,

00:18.893 --> 00:23.940
she wants me to stop using
this voice immediately.

00:24.024 --> 00:28.528
Just one game night without the
voice, Paige. Just one.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.698
[Frankie] Team Zane and Rodney,
you're in the hot seat.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.826
If the answers to my questions match what
your partner already wrote down,

00:34.909 --> 00:36.244
you get a point.

00:36.327 --> 00:39.748
Rodney, what is your favorite
mode of transportation?

00:40.832 --> 00:41.833
Submarine.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.585
-Submarine!
-[bell dings]

00:44.961 --> 00:47.797
Zane, what is your favorite
kind of sandwich?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.466
Submarine.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.551
-Submarine!
-[bell dings]

00:51.801 --> 00:53.720

00:55.472 --> 00:59.017
Paige and Frankie, it's your turn.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.353
Frankie, what's your biggest pet peeve?

01:01.436 --> 01:03.521
Oh, the unnecessarily dramatic way

01:03.605 --> 01:05.815
Paige flips over her answer cards.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.359
I resent that,

01:07.442 --> 01:09.861
and yet, I wrote, uh...

01:09.944 --> 01:12.113
the way I flip my answer cards.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.031
[bell dings]

01:13.740 --> 01:16.534
Paige, what's your favorite color?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.870
Oh, gosh! That's a hard one.

01:18.953 --> 01:22.457
I mean, sometimes, it's red,
but I also like blue.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.959
I guess today it's yellow, 'cause
I'm in a yellow kind of mood.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.878
Frankie, what did you write?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.130
Oh, gosh! That's a hard one.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.925
I mean, sometimes, it's red,
but I also like blue.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.968
I guess today it's yellow...

01:34.052 --> 01:36.471

01:39.140 --> 01:41.476
[Zane] Team Amelia and Willow are up.

01:41.559 --> 01:44.354
Amelia, what is your worst quality?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.773
My competitiveness.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.817
-I wrote...
-Competitiveness! I said it first!

01:50.193 --> 01:53.029
Willow, what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.031
Happy and fulfilled.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.033
I was close. I wrote mermaid.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.280
also played.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.410
[lively, loud voice] Let's go to the
kitchen and grab a snack.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.121
You're right. That is fun.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.461
Wow, Amelia.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.172
You really don't know anything about that
girl you're babysitting.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.758
That's my sister.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.635
Oh, that's why she's here all the time.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.222

Oh, yeah, I made a couple
changes to my channel.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.622
It was getting pretty boring just doing

04:07.706 --> 04:10.417
the behind the scenes of the
Vuuugle House thing, so...

04:10.500 --> 04:13.586
I decided I needed a house
villain to stir things up.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.088
So, who's the villain?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.048
Me.

04:17.882 --> 04:18.717
You? [scoffs]

04:20.719 --> 04:22.303
You?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.764
Villains are brilliant
masterminds of evil.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.307
You're a lot of things, Bernie Schotz,

04:26.391 --> 04:28.601
but you are definitely not a villain.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.646
I can be a villain.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.190
What makes you such an expert on villains?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.776
I watch every reality show there is.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.154
In <i>Big House with a Big Pool,</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:42.323
right after I say Tonya is gonna
betray Meredith at the pool,

04:42.407 --> 04:45.869
uh, she gonna get backstabbed by the pool.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.456
-She gonna?
-Oh, she gonna!

04:49.539 --> 04:51.207

reality show villains.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.879
Okay, well, that doesn't really
help me with my thing, so...

04:55.962 --> 04:57.380
Or maybe it does.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.132
What if I was your house villain?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.219
You know what, Frankie? You would be
really good at that.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.096
-Thanks.
-So, I'll definitely think about it.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.973
Great. Wait, what?

You're gonna think about it?

someone in the house

06:05.365 --> 06:08.952

Ugh! No!

Um, what are you doing?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.983
I'm separating the fashion dos
from the fashion don'ts.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.278
Amelia, clothing donations
don't need to be fashionable.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.155
I know, but... come on.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.157
Who wears flannel shirts?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.702
It's Frankie's.

a little sister break.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.305
Actually, I'm gonna head out
to the shelter.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.431
Why?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.266
To bring them all these clothes.

07:13.350 --> 07:17.020
We have to fold them and bring them?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.230
[sighs] Okay, I guess I'll go.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.107
Um... you know what?

07:21.191 --> 07:23.985
Don't worry about it.
Paige and I got this.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.029
-What?
-It's okay.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.531
Maybe this just isn't your thing.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.242
Oh, okay.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.452
Have fun!

07:32.535 --> 07:34.162
I'll just be here...

07:35.080 --> 07:36.331
[sighs] ...not bonding with my sister.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.542

07:43.338 --> 07:45.048
Bernie, what is this?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.633
I'm the only house villain you need.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.427
-Why are you holding auditions?
-Hello, Miss Wong.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.055
Please sign in, and we'll
call you in a few minutes.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.518
Okay, um, Zane and Rodney.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.191
Okay, so you guys
are auditioning as a team?

08:03.274 --> 08:05.151
Yes, sir. We think two villains

08:05.235 --> 08:06.986
might cause more trouble than one.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.157
Yep, the math checks out.

08:12.367 --> 08:16.162
So, tell me why you two think
you'd make great house villains.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.165
Well, first, we have an awesome name.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.083
[both] The Clock Boys!

08:21.876 --> 08:23.795
And we already have a catchphrase.

08:23.878 --> 08:27.340
[both] It's bad o'clock somewhere!

08:29.384 --> 08:32.345
Wow! I'm very impressed.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.514
You guys are exactly what I'm looking for.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.852
What? You're seriously considering these
two to be your house villains?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.271
Hey, Zane and Rodney came prepared.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.273
They have their own catchphrase.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.066
I mean, look at 'em.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.656
They're children wearing
boxes and alarm clocks.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.117
Besides, a great reality show villain

08:54.200 --> 08:56.453
is nothing like a comic book villain.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.290
Creating chaos and drama
is a nuanced skill

09:00.373 --> 09:03.168
requiring years of experience
messing with people's heads.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.045
Frankie, there's no need to get worked up.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.964
Oh, you mean like how Rodney
said Zane gets worked up

09:08.048 --> 09:09.632
when he can't tie his own shoes?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.885
I can tie my own shoes!

09:11.968 --> 09:12.844
Not cool, dude!

09:12.927 --> 09:15.347
Whoa! Rodney, that hurt.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.016
Don't explode at him like
Bernie always says you do.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.351
[screaming] I don't explode at people!

09:20.977 --> 09:25.148
And don't get me started on how Horse Face
Guy relies on random props

09:25.231 --> 09:27.192
'cause he has nothing interesting to say.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.740
And that... is how you villain a house.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.993
-Wow!
-Thank you.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.162
Thank you so much. Thank you.

09:39.245 --> 09:44.459
Wow! She's just like Tonya from
<i>Big House with a Big Pool.</i>

09:44.542 --> 09:47.253
Wow. Frankie, that...

09:47.337 --> 09:48.963
That was amazing.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.091
The part of the Vuuugle
House villain is yours.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.384
Oh!

09:53.426 --> 09:55.261
Aw, man! Thanks!

09:55.345 --> 09:58.264
It's just... It's something I enjoy.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.519
I need help.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.187
Then you've come to the right place.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.481
Please, have a seat.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.777
Here's my card.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.950
"Paige Olvera. Emotional stuff.
It's my jam."

10:17.617 --> 10:21.413
Look, in the corner, there's
a little jar of jam.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.289
I ordered, like, a thousand of these.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.916
This is the first time I'm giving one out.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.834
[squeals excitedly]

10:26.459 --> 10:28.086
How can I help?

10:30.296 --> 10:33.174
Willow and I don't have
anything in common anymore,

10:33.258 --> 10:36.219
and I'm afraid if we don't
like any of the same stuff,

10:36.302 --> 10:38.221
we're never gonna be close again.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.432
We can fix this.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.727
You guys just need to find your thing.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.396
-Oh, oh! How about we role-play?
-Okay.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.231
Um, we'll act out different scenarios

10:48.314 --> 10:50.859
until we find something
you and Willow both like.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.110
I'll play Willow. You play you.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.987
Ooh, I got the lead!

10:55.405 --> 10:58.241
Okay, so Willow loves gardening,

10:58.324 --> 11:00.160
and you love... shopping.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.953
Let's find where those things overlap.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.209
Hi, I'm Willow. Wanna garden with me, sis?

11:08.293 --> 11:11.046
Ew! Dirt! Gross! I'm gonna go shopping.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.672
Uh, Amelia,

11:12.756 --> 11:15.508
it might be easier to find something you
both like if you don't leave.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.261
-Gotcha. Let's try again.
-All right.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.682
Wanna garden with me, sis?

11:22.766 --> 11:26.144
Ew! Dirt! Gross!
I'm gonna go online shopping...

11:27.187 --> 11:28.772
right here.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.274
This is going great.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.193
Okay, new scenario.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.570
Um, I'm getting hungry.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.323
Why don't I take you to my
favorite vegan restaurant?

11:38.406 --> 11:41.409
Because I'm Willow, and I love animals.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.452
Right, yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.583
I'll have the veggie sampler.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.002
I'll have the steak.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.462
It's a vegan restaurant.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.714
Oh, right. Uh...

11:54.798 --> 11:56.174
I'll have the hummus

11:56.257 --> 11:58.635
with a side of steak.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.221
Amelia, come on. You're not even trying.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.265
I am trying! This is pointless.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.726
My sister and I,
we're just too different now.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.437
We're never gonna find our thing.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.065
Amelia, wait!

12:13.233 --> 12:15.944
Hey, if you're not gonna use the card,

12:16.027 --> 12:17.612
can you at least give it back?

12:17.696 --> 12:19.989
I only ordered a thousand!

12:27.831 --> 12:29.124
Amelia!

12:29.874 --> 12:31.668
Come on. You can't give up.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.796
Did white jeans give up when everyone
said they were out of fashion?

12:34.879 --> 12:37.924
Thank you for putting that
into words I can relate to.

12:39.050 --> 12:44.597
But I just don't think Willow and I will
ever be as close as we once were.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.811
Thank you, Paige,

12:49.894 --> 12:52.731
but I just need to be alone right now.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.899
Okay, I understand.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.360
[wind blowing]

13:00.447 --> 13:02.907
Oh, come on!

13:08.621 --> 13:10.206
Stupid tree.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.168
This is why I never go outside!

13:15.045 --> 13:17.088
Ugh! I just did my nails,

13:17.172 --> 13:19.966
and this outfit is brand-new.

13:23.970 --> 13:24.804
[Willow] Amelia?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.765
Willow?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.850
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing up there?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.269
I'm righting a wrong.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.522
I'm so proud of you.

13:34.606 --> 13:38.526
I didn't know you cared
about saving endangered trees.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.695
Uh...

13:40.779 --> 13:43.448
Yeah! Who doesn't?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.785
That's so cool!

13:46.868 --> 13:48.912
Can I save this tree with you?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.081
Wait.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.918
Would you say that saving
trees is your thing?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.128
I'm a woman of many things,

13:57.212 --> 13:59.506
but this is definitely one of them.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.009
Well, then come on up, lil' sis,

14:03.093 --> 14:05.178
'cause it's my thing too.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.934
Look at us, saving nature.

14:11.017 --> 14:15.605
It feels so good to make a difference.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.235
Okay, well, this bark is
sticky, time to get down.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.697
Oh, Meels, I love your jokes.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.199
But as you know,
our work is just beginning.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.034
We're not climbing down from here

14:28.118 --> 14:32.914
until the government agrees not
to tear down this leafy goddess!

14:32.997 --> 14:34.332
Preach!

14:35.542 --> 14:37.335
Governments work really quickly, right?

14:37.419 --> 14:40.588
Ha! Where do you think we are, Canada?

14:41.339 --> 14:46.553
We could be up here for days,
weeks, years. Who knows?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.888
We may have to withstand extreme heat...

14:48.972 --> 14:49.848
Uh-huh.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.683
-...extreme cold...
-Oh.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.309
-...no bathing...
-[cringing]

14:53.393 --> 14:54.936
...potential spider attacks.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.896
Oh, boy!

14:56.980 --> 14:58.773
Excuse me.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.317
Get this straight, tree.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.071
After I save you, I'm gonna destroy you.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.495
[crickets chirring]

15:12.912 --> 15:15.290
No wonder they make cradles out of wood.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.918
I feel like a baby
in Mother Nature's arms.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.672
Yep, who needs a king-sized bed
when you've got...

15:22.756 --> 15:23.673
[grunts]

15:25.216 --> 15:26.301
...branches?

15:27.552 --> 15:28.803
Amelia, don't move.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.889
There's something on your shoulder.

15:30.972 --> 15:31.806
What is it?

15:33.975 --> 15:35.226
Dinner.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.145
Seriously?

15:37.228 --> 15:39.898
Of course. Bugs are full of protein.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.733
Here. You take the first one.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.485
Uh, no, you.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.819
-No, you.
-No, you.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.280
-No, you. No, you. No, you.
-No, you. No, you. No, you.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.865
No, you!

15:49.532 --> 15:50.367
Okay.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.284
[crunching]

15:52.035 --> 15:53.203
Oh! [gagging]

15:54.996 --> 15:56.998
And to wash it down...

15:57.582 --> 15:59.751
we can suck the dew right off the leaf.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.885
Mmm!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.804
It's like bubbly water,

16:10.887 --> 16:13.640
except the bubbles are... dirt.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.725
[phone ringing]

16:17.894 --> 16:19.104
<i>Hey, Amelia. Where are you?</i>

16:19.187 --> 16:21.564
Hi, Paige. We're in a tree!

16:22.982 --> 16:25.652
Yeah, we're keeping it
from getting cut down,

16:25.735 --> 16:28.530
you know, because I love trees,

16:28.613 --> 16:29.614
just like Willow,

16:29.698 --> 16:31.991
and this is our thing.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.869
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

16:34.953 --> 16:37.539
<i>You love... trees.</i>

16:37.622 --> 16:41.167
<i>I think it's so great that</i>
<i>you're bonding with that... tree,</i>

16:41.251 --> 16:46.297
<i>so you can have a better relationship</i>
<i>with that... tree.</i>

16:46.381 --> 16:48.174
Why is she talking slowly,

16:48.258 --> 16:49.801
an what's wrong with her eye?

16:49.884 --> 16:52.595
Uh, she has a bug in her eye.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.972
It probably flew through the screen.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.557
4G is the future. Bye, Paige!

16:57.976 --> 16:59.978
Who's shining those lights?

17:00.061 --> 17:01.896
Malibu Action News Team,

17:01.980 --> 17:04.816
led by yours truly, Lou Scoopmaker.

17:04.899 --> 17:06.901
You can't be serious!

17:06.985 --> 17:08.987
I know. It's not my real name.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.740
But my family recently
started calling me by it,

17:11.823 --> 17:14.034
so that's a win, right?

17:14.117 --> 17:16.995
Yay! The local news media.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.997
I would have preferred national coverage,

17:19.080 --> 17:21.958
but it's just great
to get the word out there.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.211
Oh, we're not here for this.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.089
We're here to cover the big windstorm
that's about to blow in.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.343
They're expecting 40-mile-per-hour
winds tonight.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.303
-What?
-Whoo-hoo!

17:33.386 --> 17:34.971
Sounds like we're gonna get

17:35.013 --> 17:37.599
a front-row seat to nature's fury.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.894
A 40-mile-per-hour windstorm?

17:40.977 --> 17:43.813
Yep, you girls want some
help getting down from there?

17:43.897 --> 17:46.608
-Yes, please.
-Nothing can pry us from this tree

17:46.691 --> 17:49.611
except the long arm of justice.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.947
[whines] What she said!

17:54.324 --> 17:56.701
All right, girls, just hold on tight.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.787
I'm gonna get my footage and get home.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.956
Mommy hates it when I play in the wind.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.418
Lou Scoopmaker, Malibu Action News, out!

18:07.629 --> 18:12.342
I can't believe I'm jealous of Lou
Scoopmaker's life right now.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.888
Hey, Bernie, I am so
excited to get to work.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.182
I already wrote out
a bunch of villain stuff.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.976
Frankie, shh! I'm filming.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.189
The Clock Boys strike again!

18:26.272 --> 18:30.485
[both] It's bad o'clock somewhere!

18:30.694 --> 18:32.987
And cut!

18:33.071 --> 18:34.155
Great job, boys.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.157
Nailed it.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.119
Wait. What is going on?

18:39.202 --> 18:40.995
Oh, yeah. So, I thought about it more,

18:41.079 --> 18:43.289
and I decided to make Zane and
Rodney the house villains.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.541
-What?
-Yeah.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.251
I just think they're better.

18:48.336 --> 18:52.173
They have cool costumes, and their
catchphrase is really memorable.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.093
It's somewhere in Clock Town!

18:55.176 --> 18:58.054
I mean, bad clocks are everywhere!

18:58.096 --> 18:59.347
I mean...

18:59.472 --> 19:01.433
They said it 10 seconds ago,

19:01.516 --> 19:03.184
and you can't even remember it!

19:03.268 --> 19:05.812
You know, I'd love it if you
were their sidekick, though.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.647
Look, I made you a costume.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.191
The F stands for The Follower.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.985
Because after Zane and
Rodney go somewhere,

19:12.068 --> 19:13.611
you always follow them.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.739
Couldn't the F stand for Frankie?

19:15.822 --> 19:18.616
No, it has to stand for
The Follower. I trademarked it.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.076
[growls] Bernie!

19:20.994 --> 19:22.871
Why did you let me get
excited to be your villain

19:22.954 --> 19:24.372
and then take it from me?

19:24.456 --> 19:27.375
You played with my emotions
and manipulated me.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.502
That's right. I did.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.422
Because I'm the house villain.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.632
-What?
-You said I couldn't be a villain,

19:34.716 --> 19:37.135
so I made a plan to prove you wrong,

19:37.218 --> 19:39.095
and everybody was in on it.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.723
-[laughing]
-[wind howling]

19:42.932 --> 19:46.102
By the way, there's a
windstorm. Don't go outside.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.314
Well, Bernie, I gotta admit. I was wrong.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.523
You are a great villain.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.609
Yes, I am.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.736
And now, all my viewers know it too.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.279
Your camera is not on.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.324
No, your camera is not on.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.576
Saved it.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.746
It's still not on.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.459
[wind howling]

20:09.709 --> 20:11.961
It's like a hug from nature.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.423
I can't feel my face!

20:15.507 --> 20:16.341
[screaming]

20:18.677 --> 20:21.179
I hate this stupid tree!

20:21.262 --> 20:24.599
I just wish they'd chop it down!

20:27.894 --> 20:29.312
What did you just say?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.231
Willow, I'm sorry,

20:31.314 --> 20:33.733
but I... I don't wanna be up here.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.361
I wanted us to have a thing,

20:36.444 --> 20:40.073
so I lied about wanting to save the tree.

20:40.156 --> 20:40.990
[sighs]

20:41.324 --> 20:43.910
I understand if you're mad at me.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.330
Amelia, do you remember a few years ago

20:47.414 --> 20:50.375
when I said how much I loved that
scarf you covered in sequins?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.794
Duh! I remember vividly.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.254
You begged me to wear it.

20:54.337 --> 20:57.507
-I hated that thing.
-[gasping]

20:57.590 --> 21:01.469
I spent two days hot-gluing that scarf.

21:01.553 --> 21:05.181
It won first place at the Amelia
Fashion Awards.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.350
Judge Amelia gave it five Amelias.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.188
Why did you act like you liked it?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.607
'Cause I knew how much it meant to you,

21:14.691 --> 21:16.860
so I lied to make you feel better.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.320
Just like you lied to me about this tree.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.657
Wow.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.327
Thanks for going through
all this for me, Meels.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.705
It was worth it.

21:29.998 --> 21:33.084
You know, I probably
don't say this enough,

21:33.168 --> 21:34.002
but-- [spitting]

21:34.878 --> 21:36.171
Bug! Bug! Bug!

21:40.300 --> 21:41.718
I love you.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.184
Well, I guess we can get down now.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.227
No. You know what?

21:51.311 --> 21:53.313
I'm gonna stay up here.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.272
For you.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.732
Really? You'd do that?

21:57.484 --> 22:00.236
As long as it takes, sis.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.363
[Lou Scoopmaker] Hello, girls!

22:01.446 --> 22:03.990
Lou Scoopmaker,
Malibu Action News.

22:04.074 --> 22:07.410
I got a hot tip from Fritz
Oak at the Eco Desk.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.789
Turns out, this tree is being
cut down for a good reason.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.999
It's infested with a fungus

22:13.083 --> 22:14.918
that could spread to other trees.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.587
Ew! Fungus!

22:17.671 --> 22:20.256
Yeah, even I'm grossed out by that.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.384
You're on your own, Stella.

22:25.804 --> 22:30.141
And so, these brave sisters left this
handsome reporter wondering,

22:30.225 --> 22:34.312
if two's a crowd,
then maybe, tree's company.

22:36.147 --> 22:36.981
[feedback squeals]

22:37.357 --> 22:39.484
Come on, Lou! You're never going national

22:39.567 --> 22:41.444
with this weak-sauce, amateur junk!

22:41.528 --> 22:43.321
I wish there was someone in this world

22:43.405 --> 22:46.616
who could help me with
my many, many issues.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.577
Paige Olvera, emotional consultant.

22:49.661 --> 22:50.829
It's my jam.

22:50.912 --> 22:53.873
Oh, look at that. You put a jar
of jam right on the card.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.208
'Cause I get you...

22:55.291 --> 22:57.002
out of a jam!

22:57.085 --> 22:59.045
Not bad, but you wanna turn quicker

22:59.129 --> 23:00.922
and make your voice deeper.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.925
Out of a jam!

23:04.009 --> 23:05.051
No, watch me.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.929
Out of a jam!

23:08.054 --> 23:10.306
-Out of a jam!
-Out of a jam!

23:10.390 --> 23:11.975
Mustache. Out of a jam!

23:12.058 --> 23:13.184
Out of a jam!

23:15.979 --> 23:19.566
-Out of a jam!
-Out of a jam!
