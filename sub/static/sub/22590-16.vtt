00:10.428 --> 00:12.013
<i>NARRATOR".
Morning at Gotham State Prison.</i>

00:12.222 --> 00:16.059
<i>And in the office of Warden Crichton,
an old foe is saying his farewell.</i>

00:16.267 --> 00:20.396
Oh, thank you, Warden Crichton,
for all your kind words on my behalf.

00:20.605 --> 00:23.650
You've been on your best behavior
for several months now, Joker.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.110
Mr. Wayne and I felt it should be rewarded.

00:26.319 --> 00:30.240
Yes, as chairman of the parole board,
I've given your case a great deal of scrutiny.

00:30.448 --> 00:33.076
I'm convinced that you've mended
your former ways.

00:33.284 --> 00:36.913
And so in keeping with our liberal
penological practices...

00:37.121 --> 00:39.499
...we're releasing you
considerably ahead of time.

00:41.292 --> 00:45.838
Oh, well, it isn't silk,
but it's honestly made by my fellow inmates.

00:46.047 --> 00:49.050
I guess I'll have to get used
to civilian clothes.

00:49.259 --> 00:51.761
Bare With this, uh, $10 bill.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.514
We hope you will seek a new life
on the outside.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.101
One replete with good citizenship
and fine deeds.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.894
Ten dollars. Mm.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.814
I used to light my cigars
with $10 bills. Ha, ha.

01:03.022 --> 01:06.401
Oh, how about a cigar
to celebrate the occasion?

01:06.609 --> 01:09.112
Well, I don't mind if I do.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.115
No, thank you.
I never use tobacco in any form.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.499 --> 01:24.002
Ha, ha. That's very good.

01:24.210 --> 01:28.172
Ha-ha-ha. You know,
I sort of expected it to explode.

01:28.673 --> 01:29.882
Explode?

01:30.091 --> 01:32.844
Oh, you must have me confused
with somebody else, warden.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.555
I'm a reformed man. Ha-ha-ha!

01:35.763 --> 01:37.849
Well, nice seeing you again.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.563
Toodle-oo. Ha-ha-ha!

01:44.397 --> 01:48.109
Well, I wonder who's picking him up
for the drive back to Gotham City.

01:48.318 --> 01:50.236
Let's take a look.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.350
You want a lift, big boy?

02:20.558 --> 02:23.978
Make it look good, Catwoman.
Pull a gun on me, the way we planned.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.147
They're probably watching us.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.984
Get in this car, or I'll blow
whatever little brains you have out.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.030
She's kidnapping me.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.074
Honest.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.177
Kidnapped? By Catwoman?

02:56.386 --> 02:58.388
Well, he's barely out of prison.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.933
- I'd better call Commissioner Gordon.
<i>- I'll</i> take care of that, warden.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.811
Get your men after them
before they get too far away.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.063
Good idea.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.573
Stately Wayne Manor.

03:17.782 --> 03:20.159
Alfred, plug me into the Batphone
and stand by.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.453
Consider it done, sir.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.342
I think I'd better take a rain check
on that luncheon date.

03:36.551 --> 03:38.302
Mm-hm.

03:48.730 --> 03:49.772
Yes, commissioner.

03:49.981 --> 03:53.109
You're calling to tell me
that Catwoman kidnapped Joker?

03:53.317 --> 03:56.529
I might have realized you'd be on top
of the situation, Batman.

03:56.738 --> 03:58.865
Seems I'm always the last to know anything.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.992
We'll be right there.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.661
You leaving, Mr. Wayne?

04:03.870 --> 04:07.790
In light of the day's happenings, I'm gonna
forgo my usual inspection of the prison.

04:07.999 --> 04:11.127
- Any luck?
-Well, I've, uh, set up roadblocks...

04:11.335 --> 04:14.422
...at all the major highway points
leading back to Gotham City.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.798
It's a slim chance, but our only hope.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.136
With Joker in the feline clutches
of Catwoman...

04:20.344 --> 04:23.347
...who knows what all of us may be facing?

05:38.047 --> 05:40.049
<i>NARRATOR".
And at the Sleazy Hotel...</i>

05:40.258 --> 05:44.762
<i>...a sleazy hotel across the street
from police headquarters...</i>

05:46.931 --> 05:49.725
Oh, thanks for my old suit, Catwoman.

05:49.934 --> 05:52.562
I felt out of place in this one.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.397
You looked out of place, Joker.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.108
But now you're back
to your handsome self again.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.610
Yes. Ha-ha-ha.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.153
What are you doing?

06:01.362 --> 06:06.909
The telescopic lens on this Catgun
affords me a fine and magnified view...

06:07.118 --> 06:08.744
...of Commissioner Gordon's office...

06:08.953 --> 06:11.455
...right across the street.
-Oh!

06:12.623 --> 06:15.376
Oh, so it does, so it does.

06:15.585 --> 06:17.670
And unless my youthful eyes
are deceiving me...

06:17.879 --> 06:21.007
...that looks like the Dynamic Dimwits
in that office.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.426
You're going to kill them?
I hope, I hope, I hope.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.760
No, Joker.

06:24.969 --> 06:31.475
Just going to send Batman the first
of several little tokens of my affection.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.728
- The first?
-Yes.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.063
He's as evilly clever as we.

06:36.272 --> 06:39.942
He'll no doubt figure out
where my memento came from...

06:40.151 --> 06:42.695
...and will pay a call on this hotel room.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.698
- Oh, we better be gone.
-We will.

06:45.907 --> 06:50.119
But I'll leave a second
token of my devotion in our place.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.500
Yes, we have our work cut out
for us, all right.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.628
I should say we do.

06:58.836 --> 07:02.423
Anytime two arch-criminals get together,
Gotham City, and perhaps the world...

07:02.632 --> 07:04.342
...is in for enormous difficulty.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.843
But Catwoman kidnapped Joker.

07:06.052 --> 07:09.513
Maybe the fellow
sincerely wants to go straight.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.521
Mother Machree, we're under attack.

07:25.655 --> 07:27.406
No, hold your fire, Chief O'Hara.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.992
We're not sure which direction
that bullet came from.

07:30.201 --> 07:33.037
-Innocent people might be hurt.
-Yes.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.069
It appears to be a message of some sort.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.612
Holy special delivery.

08:06.821 --> 08:09.198
"This one was just a warning, Batman.

08:09.407 --> 08:11.659
The next one will be between your eyelids"

08:11.867 --> 08:12.910
Any signature?

08:13.119 --> 08:14.787
"Signed, a well-wisher."

08:14.996 --> 08:19.125
Well, it seems like somebody's
interested in your welfare.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.585
You stay put.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.588
We'll Batcreep to the window.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.182
Somebody lose a contact lens?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.351
Get down, Barbara.

08:42.565 --> 08:46.444
It must have come from the Hotel Sleazy
across the street.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.864
Judging from the trajectory and the angle...

08:50.072 --> 08:53.659
...and figuring the wind at six knots per hour,
north by northeast...

08:53.868 --> 08:56.287
...as per this morning's weather report...

08:56.495 --> 08:59.957
...X times six squared, over...

09:04.086 --> 09:05.421
Yes.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.507
You see, it came from that room
on that floor.

09:14.305 --> 09:17.433
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Are you sure this is the room?

09:17.641 --> 09:21.479
Positive. That's the suit Joker wore
when he was released from prison.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.123
Mm.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.000
Mm-hm.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.127
Mm!

09:45.836 --> 09:47.755
No fingerprints.

09:49.006 --> 09:54.178
But judging from the familiar scent of Cat Lily
perfume, which is Catwoman's trademark...

09:54.386 --> 09:56.347
...and that suit over there...

09:56.555 --> 09:59.517
...I would assume that they were both
in this room...

09:59.725 --> 10:02.561
...not less than three minutes ago.

10:02.812 --> 10:03.938
Find anything?

10:04.146 --> 10:06.023
That scrap of paper. Nothing more.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.987
Batgirl, what are you doing here?

10:12.196 --> 10:16.075
Just thought I might be able
to lend a glove, so to speak.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.078
You constantly amaze me.
I can't figure out how you manage...

10:19.286 --> 10:21.997
...to stay on top of a caper
as quickly as we do.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.000
Tea leaves, stars, crystal-gazing...

10:25.209 --> 10:28.212
...all part of a woman crime-fighter's
arsenal, Batman.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.463
Any clues?

10:29.672 --> 10:32.842
Enough to tell us know we're dealing
with both Catwoman and Joker.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.343
How can I help?

10:34.552 --> 10:38.264
Until we find something
more tangible, you can't.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.891
Well, then it's hello and goodbye.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.060
At least for now.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.105
At least for now.

10:47.565 --> 10:50.484
That scrap of paper, Batman, it's gone.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.446
Yes, Batgirl slipped it into her belt
when she thought I wasn't looking.

10:54.655 --> 10:58.117
- You think she's trying to double-cross us?
-No, but she's a woman, Robin...

10:58.325 --> 11:02.371
...with a woman's inborn desire
to outsmart men.

11:02.955 --> 11:07.459
Tea leaves, crystal-gazing, stars.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.881
I wonder what she'll come up with next.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.592
Whoa. Woo, ha-ha-ha!

11:19.471 --> 11:21.724
- You like it, Joker?
-it's me.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.684
It's like I never left home.

11:23.893 --> 11:27.271
Oh, you certainly have an eye
for decoration.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.733
Now it's time to meet my cat's paws.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.402
Front and center, henchmen.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.948
This is Giggler.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.410
Oh, it's sure gonna be nice
working with you, Joker. Heh, heh.

11:41.619 --> 11:43.412
Oh, ha-ha-ha, yes.

11:43.621 --> 11:46.415
- This is Laugher.
-Ha-ha-ha!

11:46.624 --> 11:50.294
I've always wanted to work with you, Joker.
It's the realization of my boyhood dream.

11:52.046 --> 11:55.382
Well, thanks, fellas. Keep smiling.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.426
They're good men, Joker.

11:57.635 --> 12:02.264
Perfect aides-de-camp
for our evil crime spree, don't you think?

12:02.473 --> 12:05.809
Oh, perfect, Catwoman. Ha-ha-ha.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.771
Oh, and speaking of evil crime sprees...

12:08.979 --> 12:11.732
Shall I catalog it for you, Joker?

12:11.941 --> 12:15.486
- Categorically, Catwoman.
-Ha, ha.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.698
Then cast your eyes on this.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.659
- A poem?
-Yes.

12:21.867 --> 12:26.455
Handwritten over 200 years ago
during the French and Indian War.

12:26.664 --> 12:29.875
I purloined it from the library.

12:30.084 --> 12:33.712
It was written by Gargon Maltese,
the famous crook...

12:33.921 --> 12:38.550
...and it's a clue to 1 million pounds
of gunpowder he stole...

12:38.759 --> 12:42.054
...and hid someplace in the environs
of Gotham City.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.056
Oh, now you're talking.

12:44.265 --> 12:46.433
One million of anything is a lot.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.644
We're going to find that gunpowder...

12:48.852 --> 12:51.855
...and blow a hole
in the federal depository building...

12:52.064 --> 12:53.649
...you can drive a truck through.

12:53.857 --> 12:57.653
Then drive a truck through
and loot the place.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.990
Oh, why don't we just heist
a bunch of dynamite?

13:01.198 --> 13:04.034
Far too simple, Joker.

13:04.243 --> 13:07.997
And not half as much fun
as being devilishly clever.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.834
- Oh.
-After all, we're not common thieves.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.753
- No. Ha-ha-ha.
-Listen.

13:14.962 --> 13:20.175
<i>Gunpowder is what you shall find
Should you have a most logical mind</i>

13:20.384 --> 13:23.304
<i>In riches you'll wallow
If you carefully follow</i>

13:23.512 --> 13:26.890
<i>The clues I have herein consigned</i>

13:27.099 --> 13:29.560
His iambic pentameter is a bit off.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.563
- What he should have said was--
-Now, listen.

13:33.063 --> 13:38.319
<i>My old nightshirt will do for a start
In its hem is a clue that's a chart</i>

13:38.652 --> 13:43.032
<i>Then from there find my crib
On its side is a fib</i>

13:43.240 --> 13:47.369
<i>And my powder is yours, if you're smart</i>

13:47.578 --> 13:50.289
Oh, your voice has a nice lilt, Catwoman.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.541
But just what does all that mean?

13:52.750 --> 13:56.712
I've located the nightshirt and the crib.

13:56.920 --> 14:02.551
Now our next move is to purloin
and if possible...

14:02.760 --> 14:06.096
...permanently purge Batman, Batgirl...

14:06.513 --> 14:09.892
...and Robin, the Boy Wonder.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.560
Do they know about that poem?

14:11.769 --> 14:13.771
If they don't, they should.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.230
Shortly.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.566
The missing corner of this parchment...

14:17.775 --> 14:22.446
...was intentionally left
in that fleabag of a hotel room. Ha, ha.

14:22.946 --> 14:28.786
Meanwhile back in her guise as
Barbara Gordon, the mild-mannered librarian...

14:33.791 --> 14:36.001
<i>The document she wants is missing...</i>

14:36.293 --> 14:41.215
<i>...but the Gotham City Library
makes microcopies of everything.</i>

15:01.652 --> 15:04.071
<i>- I'll</i> take it, Alfred.
- Right, sir.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.991
- Yes, commissioner?
-Batman, this is Batgirl.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.661
Batgirl on
Commissioner Gordon's red phone?

15:11.954 --> 15:14.164
Just as there are secrets in crime-fighting...

15:14.373 --> 15:16.875
...so should every crime-fighter
be allowed his...

15:17.292 --> 15:20.003
<i>-...or her secret.
- Agreed.</i>

15:20.462 --> 15:24.133
I've come up on something that may help
in your search for Catwoman and Joker.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.218
Crystal-gazing again, Batgirl?

15:26.427 --> 15:28.137
This time I used cards.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.181
Meet me immediately
at the apartment of Little Louie Groovy...

15:31.390 --> 15:33.684
...27 Disc Drive.
-Little Louie Groovy...

15:33.892 --> 15:37.521
...the teenage tycoon who's never missed
producing a million-seller record?

15:37.729 --> 15:41.650
- Gosh, Bruce, I've always wanted to meet him.
-We'll be right there.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.904
To the Batpoles.

16:08.427 --> 16:10.679
<i>NARRATOR".
Shortly, in the groovy pad of Little Louie...</i>

16:10.888 --> 16:13.223
<i>...the young tycoon
of the recording business...</i>

16:13.432 --> 16:16.351
Who you recording tonight?
You never tell me anything anymore.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.438
A new group I just discovered
about 20 minutes ago.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.815
Called the Gotham Boulevard Off-Ramp.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.194
They'll have the number one record
in the country a week from Tuesday.

16:25.402 --> 16:29.114
Look, I gotta make my money fast.
Another couple of years, I'll be in my mid-20s.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.284
Too old for the music business,
over the hill.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.036
Heh.

16:34.244 --> 16:35.996
It's no wonder I'm insecure.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.458
- Okay, split.
-Ooh. Ooh!

16:39.666 --> 16:42.085
What a client I got.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.006
Little Louie, you've just slipped the groove.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.758
Who's that?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.765
Look, if you're here to rob me,
I ought to warn you...

17:36.974 --> 17:39.351
...that I'm a karate expert and I can hurt you.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.644
So stay back.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.854
Hyah!

17:43.063 --> 17:45.691
Karate isn't effective
unless accompanied by yelling.

17:45.899 --> 17:50.195
Let him howl until he
sprains a vocal chord, then get him.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.629
I can't yell anymore.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.506
I'm done for.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.849
All right, boys. Now.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.907
Hoo,hoo!
Oh, I have to give you credit, Catwoman.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.869
I expected this place to be a shambles
because of a fight.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.538
As it may yet be, Joker.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.999
So, Batman, you found us.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.376
As you perhaps planned, Catwoman.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.921
The mere thought of pulling a caper
without your masked meddling...

18:50.130 --> 18:52.215
...would be most perturbing to me.

18:52.424 --> 18:56.136
Found us you have, and get you we will.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.471
Get them, boys.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.775
My first royalty check.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.807
No, no, that's $4000. Please, don't.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.451
Oh, no, no. Please, please.

20:09.626 --> 20:14.589
You guys ruined my apartment.
It'll cost over $11,000 to replace all the goodies.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.634
Never fear, Mr. Groovy,
full restitution will be made.

20:17.843 --> 20:22.723
Even if it takes Catwoman and Joker
the rest of their natural lives to pay it off.

20:23.140 --> 20:27.602
I can't understand why you went
to all that trouble to steal a nightshirt.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.229
He doesn't know about the gunpowder.

20:29.438 --> 20:31.690
- Give him a catchy story.
-Oh...

20:31.982 --> 20:36.611
Well, it was all Catwoman's fault, fellas.
If you recall, it was she who kidnapped me.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.238
You cat fink.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.574
She told me that Louie Groovy
was a hip oat...

20:40.782 --> 20:43.452
...and that it might be fun
if we stole the cat's pajamas.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.496
Well, you know how I am
about practical jokes.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.206
I couldn't resist it.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.834
You must have
flipped your raspberry, Joker.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.503
How could you allow anyone
to talk you into something stupid?

20:53.712 --> 20:56.506
Agreed.
You're absolutely and positively right.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.925
Oh, I made a dreadful mistake.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.470
Oh, let bygones be bygones.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.056
I'd like to shake hands with both of you.
Can't we be friends?

21:05.557 --> 21:07.893
I'd rather shake hands with a spitting cobra.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.644
You're being cynical, Robin.

21:09.853 --> 21:14.107
"To err is human, to forgive divine."

21:14.316 --> 21:17.486
Perhaps he has repented.

21:17.861 --> 21:22.157
I think the poor fellow
should have a fighting chance.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.159
I'll shake your hand, Joker.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.621
Oh, okay, I'll shake your hand too.

21:32.042 --> 21:35.629
- Another practical joke, Joker?
- Not exactly, Batman.

21:36.213 --> 21:39.007
No, it's my lethal Joker-buzzer.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.885
One by one,
your five senses will leave you...

21:42.093 --> 21:46.640
...then your lungs will collapse,
and shortly you'll be kaput, finis, defunct.

21:46.848 --> 21:51.019
Ha-ha-ha. Sorry we can't stay
for the big finish, Batman...

21:51.228 --> 21:53.980
...but I'll always treasure the memory
of this moment.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.318
Let's go.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.090
Three beats a minute, not too good.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.275
What took you so long, Batgirl?

22:38.483 --> 22:41.319
Rush hour traffic.
Plus all the lights were against me.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.572
You wouldn't want me to speed, would you?

22:43.780 --> 22:46.074
Your good driving habits
almost cost us our lives.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.951
Rules are rules, Robin.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.954
But you do have a point.

22:54.165 --> 22:57.085
How did you know that Catwoman
and Joker would be here?

22:57.294 --> 22:59.921
It's all written in a poem they have
in their possession.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.800
The nightshirt they stole and cradle
are clues to an enormous cache of gunpowder.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.678
- Where is the cradle?
-In the possession of Karnaby Katz...

23:06.887 --> 23:09.472
...devil-may-care men's
clothing designer from Londinium.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.391
Here, drink this.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.978
Water? Champagne.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.320
Over here.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.491
Oh, my head.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.828
- We're too late.
-What happened, Mr. Katz?

23:33.538 --> 23:39.878
The 17-year locusts have
descended upon me, governor.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.966
But they didn't touch the safe
or my wife's jewels...

23:45.175 --> 23:49.095
...or my collection of comic books
or anything valuable like that.

23:49.304 --> 23:54.893
All they took was a little cradle
that I picked up at an antique store.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.145
Why do you suppose they did that?

23:57.354 --> 23:59.022
That is the question.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.732
How long ago did they leave?

24:00.941 --> 24:02.859
Seconds before you walked in.

24:03.068 --> 24:05.403
I thought you might have met them
on their way out.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.366
Do you have any idea
where the gunpowder might be, Batgirl...

24:09.574 --> 24:11.910
...or why they might it?

24:12.327 --> 24:15.705
The poem would've led us to the clues,
and without the clues, we're lost.

24:16.373 --> 24:19.084
We can just wait and see
what their next move is.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.295
Where could they have disappeared to
so quickly?

24:23.546 --> 24:26.841
<i>NARRATOR". Closer than you think.
Just outside waiting to ambush you.</i>

24:27.050 --> 24:32.013
<i>Will Joker and Catwoman make good
their perfidious plan to steal millions?</i>

24:32.222 --> 24:35.308
<i>For the answer to these
and other cataclysmic questions...</i>

24:35.517 --> 24:38.061
<i>...watch the next episode.</i>
