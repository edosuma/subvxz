17:21.191 --> 17:22.695
(Michael sighs)

17:22.728 --> 17:25.333
Honey, can I ask you something?

17:25.366 --> 17:27.705
When you watch these things,

17:27.738 --> 17:30.611
do you fantasize about being
the masochist or the sadist?

17:30.644 --> 17:32.514
Okay, this is way too fucked‐up

17:32.548 --> 17:35.219
a conversation to have
with your parents, all right?

17:35.253 --> 17:36.789
I'm sorry
I looked at that stuff

17:36.823 --> 17:38.325
when I told you guys I wouldn't.
Bye.

17:38.359 --> 17:40.096
Nope. No.
That is not good enough.

17:40.129 --> 17:43.168
Okay? We're gonna
want you to see a therapist.

17:43.202 --> 17:46.475
To find out what‐‐
why pain and shame turns me on?

17:46.509 --> 17:48.245
It turn every girl on.

17:48.279 --> 17:49.615
Haven't you seen
Fifty Shades of Grey?

17:49.649 --> 17:52.186
No, this is not just
shame and pain.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.659
‐It's violence.
‐We are putting a child lock
on the Internet

17:54.692 --> 17:57.463
and you are grounded
this weekend for lying to us.

17:57.498 --> 17:59.434
Wh‐What? No.
You can't.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.506
I‐I have a slumber party
to go to.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.142
Whose?

18:03.175 --> 18:06.148
This girl Maya, who I like,
and her friends.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.588
I'm sorry, okay?
I'll do whatever you want.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.793
I'll go to therapy, just...

18:11.826 --> 18:13.563
please...

18:13.597 --> 18:15.399
don't take this from me.

18:17.538 --> 18:18.840
Fine.

18:18.873 --> 18:20.577
But you are seeing a therapist.

18:20.611 --> 18:22.113
She'll be at the house tomorrow.

18:22.146 --> 18:23.750
Hey.

18:23.783 --> 18:25.353
No more lying.

18:25.386 --> 18:28.158
Honey, we're
understanding parents.

18:28.192 --> 18:29.829
We're not uptight.

18:29.862 --> 18:31.799
I mean,
I got photos of Michael

18:31.833 --> 18:33.737
at the Folsom Street Fair
from before you were born

18:33.770 --> 18:35.206
that will prove that.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.811
But there is a line
when sex stops

18:37.845 --> 18:40.617
and something very dark
and unhealthy starts.

18:40.651 --> 18:42.554
Okay?

18:42.588 --> 18:44.859
Okay.
(sniffles)

18:44.892 --> 18:47.498
I understand.

18:47.531 --> 18:48.767
Love you.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.804
Hey, we love you, too,
sweetheart.

18:50.837 --> 18:53.175
Love you too.
Uh...

18:54.612 --> 18:56.214
(sighs)

18:56.248 --> 18:58.352
‐(door opens)
‐I think it went well.

18:58.385 --> 19:00.189
‐Yeah.
‐(door slams)

19:00.222 --> 19:01.926
Okay.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.530
TEACHER:
The largest part
of the human brain

19:03.563 --> 19:04.865
is the cerebrum,

19:04.899 --> 19:06.569
which is divided
into two hemispheres.

19:06.602 --> 19:09.274
And underneath lies
the brain stem,

19:09.307 --> 19:11.445
and behind that
sits the cerebellum.

19:11.478 --> 19:13.817
The outermost layer
of the cerebrum

19:13.850 --> 19:15.419
‐is the cerebral cortex,
‐(phone vibrates)

19:15.453 --> 19:18.325
which consists of four lobes‐‐
the frontal,

19:18.359 --> 19:20.697
(echoing): parietal,
temporal and occipital.

19:20.731 --> 19:22.868
Like all vertebrae brains,

19:22.901 --> 19:25.741
the human brain develops
from three sections

19:25.774 --> 19:28.880
known as the forebrain,
midbrain and hindbrain.

19:55.534 --> 19:56.769
(drawer scrapes)

20:14.003 --> 20:16.475
(sighs)
Fuck me.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.570

22:10.604 --> 22:12.340
‐Scarlett, you okay?
‐Who are you?

22:12.373 --> 22:14.778
I'm gonna call 911.
Just get out of our house.

22:14.812 --> 22:16.348
Get out of our fucking house!

22:16.381 --> 22:18.318
(laughing)

22:19.989 --> 22:21.492
Gotcha.

22:21.526 --> 22:23.663
‐Oh, my God. Scarlett.
‐What?

22:23.696 --> 22:25.399
‐What the hell are you doing?
‐Oh, my...

22:25.432 --> 22:27.069
‐Where did you get that suit?
‐Jesus.

22:27.103 --> 22:28.606
I found it in the house.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.975
I threw it away,

22:30.009 --> 22:32.848
but I thought you guys
put it back in my closet.

22:32.881 --> 22:34.450
A used S and M suit?

22:34.484 --> 22:35.820
Why the fuck would we do that?

22:35.854 --> 22:37.123
I don't know.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.993
‐Isn't it cool, though?
‐(both): No.

22:39.027 --> 22:40.897
‐Were you scared?
‐Go take that thing off.

22:40.931 --> 22:42.701
And go take a very hot shower.

22:42.734 --> 22:44.905
‐I don't ever want to see
that again.
‐No, I'm keeping it.

22:44.939 --> 22:46.742
Oh, my God.
Absolutely not.

22:46.776 --> 22:48.613
God, you guys think you can
control every part of me.

22:48.646 --> 22:50.984
Well, guess what‐‐
it is my body and my mind,

22:51.017 --> 22:53.155
‐and you can't control it.
‐Yeah? Okay, fine.

22:53.188 --> 22:54.758
‐Then I'm gonna tear it off you
and I'm gonna throw it...
‐Stop! No!

22:54.792 --> 22:56.862
‐Ow! Fuck.
‐Oh, my God. Daddy, I'm sorry.

22:56.896 --> 22:58.733
‐Okay, hang on, hang on.
‐I'm sorry.

22:58.766 --> 23:00.837
‐Fuck.
‐Okay, here, babe.

23:00.870 --> 23:02.741
You think you need stitches?

23:02.774 --> 23:06.616
‐I do. Fuck.
‐Okay, okay.
Let's get you dressed, okay?

23:06.649 --> 23:08.820
‐I think there's
an urgent care nearby.
‐Let me come with you.

23:08.853 --> 23:10.456
No.
Just go to your room.

23:10.489 --> 23:11.759
You can come out to throw away

23:11.792 --> 23:13.496
that awful costume,
but that is it.

23:13.529 --> 23:14.899
And please be aware, young lady,

23:14.932 --> 23:17.470
I will not be talking to you
for weeks.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.009
(quietly):
Just let me...

23:39.147 --> 23:42.053
found that only 17%
of young women under 18

23:42.086 --> 23:44.057
watched porn
for sexual excitement.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.696
and only 0.3 of them
watched violent porn.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.833
So you're saying I'm a freak.

23:48.866 --> 23:50.770
I'm saying that when someone's
behavior is atypical,

23:50.804 --> 23:52.774
it's worth exploring
the reasons why.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.878
Scarlett, you're not a freak.

23:54.912 --> 23:57.651
You're not weird
or defective in any way.

23:57.684 --> 23:59.655
What turns you on
turns you on.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.559
The only reason why
we have to get into this

24:01.592 --> 24:04.030
is because last night
you acted out in a violent way.

24:04.063 --> 24:06.468
That was an accident.
I never would have hurt my dads.

24:06.502 --> 24:08.573
Honey, then why
scare us like that?

24:08.606 --> 24:10.710
I don't know, 'cause I thought
it was funny or something.

24:10.744 --> 24:12.948
We prank each other
all the time, don't we?

24:14.150 --> 24:15.787
Uh, she's not wrong about that.
We do.

24:15.820 --> 24:18.493
I mean, one time
we challenged Troy

24:18.526 --> 24:19.795
to a water balloon fight

24:19.828 --> 24:21.699
but we filled
our balloons with paint.

24:21.732 --> 24:22.934
Yeah, and one time I changed

24:22.968 --> 24:24.938
Michael's iPhone language
to Chinese.

24:24.972 --> 24:26.976
He had to take it to
the Apple Store to get it fixed.

24:28.011 --> 24:29.581
So you think
dressing up in a costume

24:29.615 --> 24:31.585
and threatening your dads
with a knife

24:31.619 --> 24:33.088
is in the same ballpark
of fun and games

24:33.121 --> 24:35.760
as changing a language
on an iPhone?

24:36.762 --> 24:38.098
Uh, we tend to be

24:38.131 --> 24:40.002
a little overprotective. Um...

24:42.006 --> 24:44.143
When Scarlett was three,
she was kidnapped.

24:45.647 --> 24:47.116
I was, uh, at the market.

24:47.149 --> 24:48.553
And I...

24:48.586 --> 24:50.724
I put her
in her car seat first.

24:52.193 --> 24:53.963
And then I went around back

24:53.997 --> 24:55.967
to put the groceries
in the trunk.

24:56.001 --> 24:58.138
(grunts)

25:00.142 --> 25:02.614
(groans)

25:02.647 --> 25:04.083
(engine starts)

25:04.117 --> 25:05.887
While I was back there,
someone stole the car

25:05.920 --> 25:07.223
with Scarlett in it.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.526
What are you doing?

25:08.559 --> 25:10.162
No, that's my daughter!

25:10.195 --> 25:13.569
No! No!

25:13.603 --> 25:15.573
Scarlett!

25:15.607 --> 25:18.613
‐That's terrible.
‐Yeah, she was missing
for ten days.

25:18.646 --> 25:22.253
They found the car right away,
but no sign of Scarlett.

25:22.286 --> 25:24.558
‐It was all over the news.
‐TROY: Mm‐hmm.

25:24.591 --> 25:27.129
Finally, a pediatrician's office
called the police.

25:27.163 --> 25:29.535
This woman had brought
a three‐year‐old girl in

25:29.568 --> 25:31.739
for a checkup
without any information

25:31.772 --> 25:33.810
about her "daughter's"
medical history.

25:33.843 --> 25:36.782
Turns out that this woman
had just lost her own daughter.

25:36.816 --> 25:39.320
Her ex‐husband
had murdered the child.

25:39.353 --> 25:41.224
I guess it just
drove the poor woman mad.

25:41.257 --> 25:43.095
She went looking
for a replacement.

25:44.865 --> 25:47.704
Scarlett, do you remember
anything about those ten days?

25:49.708 --> 25:51.077
Not really.

25:51.111 --> 25:53.850
I mean, I don't even
remember being scared

25:53.883 --> 25:56.287
or anyone trying to hurt me
or anything.

25:56.321 --> 25:58.826
She didn't have
a scratch on her.

25:58.860 --> 26:01.231
I mean, we're the ones who were
the most traumatized by it.

26:02.901 --> 26:04.938
But then, when we saw
the porn sites

26:04.972 --> 26:07.744
and the suit we got worried

26:07.778 --> 26:11.719
that maybe
she had been affected.

26:13.288 --> 26:16.027
Maybe.

26:16.060 --> 26:18.165
What I'm most worried about
is this house.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.237
Scarlett, you've heard
all the stories

26:21.271 --> 26:22.941
about what happened here, right?

26:22.974 --> 26:25.847
Yeah. Like Amityville Horror
on crystal meth.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.951
Do you think
it's been challenging,

26:27.984 --> 26:29.320
emotionally, moving in here?

26:29.353 --> 26:30.957
I'm sorry, we don't believe

26:30.990 --> 26:32.359
‐in haunted houses.
‐(chuckles)

26:32.393 --> 26:34.063
Seriously, why would
a spirit stick around

26:34.097 --> 26:36.301
on Earth when it has
the whole universe to explore?

26:36.334 --> 26:38.105
The stories are absurd.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.875
We believe in science
in this family.

26:39.908 --> 26:42.814
(chuckles) I don't believe
in haunted houses, either.

26:42.848 --> 26:46.054
But I do believe that knowing
what dark things have occurred

26:46.087 --> 26:49.928
in a place can create a darkness
in someone's psyche.

26:49.962 --> 26:53.235
It's the reason
why cemeteries feel scary

26:53.268 --> 26:57.042
or old dungeons
or "haunted" houses.

26:58.178 --> 27:00.115
If we know what terrible things

27:00.149 --> 27:01.685
have happened in a place,

27:01.719 --> 27:03.221
then we are forced
to confront the truth

27:03.255 --> 27:05.727
that terrible things
can happen at all.

27:07.263 --> 27:08.766
I mean,
it's impossible not to get

27:08.800 --> 27:10.837
a little dark,
a little depressed.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.208
It affects all of us.

27:13.241 --> 27:15.245
I‐I felt it myself
when I came in here.

27:15.279 --> 27:16.749
A heaviness in the air.

27:16.782 --> 27:18.418
See?
It's all your fault.

27:18.451 --> 27:20.355
I didn't say that.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.259
I'm sorry, we have to end.

27:22.293 --> 27:23.963
‐(pen clicks)
‐But we're not‐we're not done.

27:23.996 --> 27:25.733
Can we pay you for another hour?

27:25.767 --> 27:27.369
I have another client
all the way over in Brentwood.

27:27.403 --> 27:29.842
‐But I would like to see
all of you next week.
‐MICHAEL: Yes.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.948
‐And Scarlett alone
later this week.
‐MICHAEL: Great.

27:32.981 --> 27:35.820
You can set all that up
with my office.

27:35.854 --> 27:37.757
‐Would you mind if I used
the restroom before I go?
‐No.

27:37.791 --> 27:39.862
Oh, sure, it's the third door
down that hall.

27:39.895 --> 27:42.099
Thank you.
I'll see myself out.

27:44.003 --> 27:45.673
Definitely no slumber party
tonight, though.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.409
What? No.

27:47.443 --> 27:49.347
Hey, your father has
six stitches in his arm.

27:49.380 --> 27:51.752
I'm sorry, you'll have to see
this girl next weekend.

27:51.785 --> 27:53.823
Fuck you! Fuck both of you!
You heard her.

27:53.856 --> 27:57.797
This is all because you moved us
into this stupid fucking house.

27:57.831 --> 28:00.369
I wish that kidnapper
would have kept me!

28:02.339 --> 28:04.443
‐(sighs) So do we.
‐Michael.

28:04.477 --> 28:06.414
Sorry.
Sorry, I went dark.

28:06.447 --> 28:08.819
‐That's not helpful.
‐Sorry, honey.

28:14.063 --> 28:16.034
(creaking)

28:26.889 --> 28:28.793
Scarlett?

28:30.964 --> 28:33.235
Is anyone there?

28:33.268 --> 28:34.838
‐(wood snaps)
‐(giggling)

28:37.877 --> 28:39.915
ANDI:
Hello?

28:49.835 --> 28:51.839
BOY (echoes):
You are going to die in there.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.204
(muttering softly)

29:13.014 --> 29:14.818
(exhales)

29:22.801 --> 29:24.003
(quietly):
The fuck?

29:40.570 --> 29:43.375
‐Whose blood was that?
‐I don't know.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.880
Hers, maybe?
Time of the month?

29:45.913 --> 29:47.984
Oh, right.

29:48.018 --> 29:50.890
It would also explain
how bitchy she's been.

29:51.959 --> 29:54.531
You want to get blitzed on Xanax
and edibles and watch The Crown?

29:54.564 --> 29:57.436

There's another therapist here,

46:32.291 --> 46:33.528

We need to talk about
your feelings about this.

46:39.406 --> 46:42.478
