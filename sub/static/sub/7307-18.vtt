WEBVTT

00:09.417 --> 00:10.532
Rod, wake up.

00:10.627 --> 00:12.916
- What?
- I heard a noise.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.338
Come on. Aren't you gonna check?

00:16.758 --> 00:17.873
Check what?

00:18.802 --> 00:19.881
That.

00:21.721 --> 00:23.761
It's probably just Bella.

00:28.186 --> 00:29.265
Rod?

00:31.272 --> 00:32.351
Rod?

00:33.400 --> 00:35.108
Damn it, Rod,
why didn't you answer me?

00:35.193 --> 00:36.984
You scared the hell out of me.

00:38.655 --> 00:41.110
Turn over and lay on your stomach.

00:41.992 --> 00:44.483
Do as I say and you won't get hurt.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.575
Do it.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.077
It's 3:00 in the morning,

01:56.166 --> 01:57.685
you hear a strange noise in your house,

01:57.709 --> 01:59.437
- what do you do?
- Slide the pistol from under my pillow,

01:59.461 --> 02:01.397
- and I go after the guy.
- I'm talking about real people, Kate.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.024
Why do they always feel the need
to go and look?

02:03.048 --> 02:04.328
It's called human nature, Tony.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.713
Let me guess.
You're that person in a horror movie

02:06.802 --> 02:08.613
that decides that
since all your friends are dead,

02:08.637 --> 02:10.698
you really need to go check out
the demonic breathing noise

02:10.722 --> 02:11.885
down in the basement?

02:11.973 --> 02:13.493
Well, that beats being the girl
who twists her ankle

02:13.517 --> 02:14.744
and gets everybody else killed.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.537
You sleep with a gun under your pillow
every night?

02:16.561 --> 02:18.056
- Well, it depends.
- On what?

02:18.146 --> 02:19.391
On who I'm sleeping with.

02:19.481 --> 02:20.512
Oh!

02:21.441 --> 02:23.897
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.001
I mean,
Tony just asked me what I would do

02:26.029 --> 02:28.188
if a man came into my bedroom
and I said it depends.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.780
I mean, it doesn't depend on the man.

02:31.535 --> 02:33.574
Tony, could you
help me out here, please?

02:34.454 --> 02:36.826
- She sleeps with a gun, boss.
- That true?

02:37.416 --> 02:39.207
Sort of. Sometimes.

02:39.710 --> 02:40.789
Yes.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.958
Good girl.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.588
What do we know about last night?

02:48.677 --> 02:49.708
Not much.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.555
The fugitive is a former SEAL
named Jack Curtin.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.439
He somehow managed to escape
from Leavenworth,

02:54.474 --> 02:55.637
and nobody seems to know how.

02:55.726 --> 02:58.347
We do know
he broke into a house at 03:40

02:58.437 --> 03:01.397
and scared the hell out of two civilians
before stealing the guy's clothes.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.432
Get me everything on him,
birth to last night.

03:03.525 --> 03:05.683
I thought Leavenworth
was Army CID jurisdiction?

03:05.777 --> 03:09.063
CID's gonna search where he's been,
we're gonna find out where he's going.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.907
Have Leavenworth pack up Curtin's cell,
overnight it to Abby.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.636
I want everything
but the paint on the walls.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.736
- You got it.
- Do we know what this guy was in for?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.498
Same thing I'm gonna be
if you don't get your ass moving.

03:18.582 --> 03:19.744
Right.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.579
Murder.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.708
And you didn't even use a lifeline.

03:26.590 --> 03:29.128
What makes you so sure
he's not running to Canada or Mexico?

03:29.217 --> 03:31.044
He spent a year in pretrial confinement.

03:31.136 --> 03:32.655
If he wanted to run,
he wouldn't have waited

03:32.679 --> 03:33.990
until he was sent to Leavenworth.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.659
Well, if he wanted to kidnap his kid,
he could've done that back then, too.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.304
- Well, yeah, there is that.
- So why are we here?

03:39.394 --> 03:42.597
I want you to keep an eye on his son
till I can arrange for a protection detail.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.208
Is that a nice way of saying baby-sit?

03:44.232 --> 03:46.225
Hey, you're catching on.

03:46.401 --> 03:48.310
Has your grandson
received any calls or letters

03:48.403 --> 03:49.945
from his father recently?

03:50.030 --> 03:53.031
No. And if he did,
I wouldn't let him hear or read them.

03:53.116 --> 03:56.402
Has he had any contact with his father
since you were awarded custody?

03:56.495 --> 04:00.444
We were granted custody because
his father murdered two people.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.292
One of them was his mother,
our daughter.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.702
So why would we give him visitation?

04:06.171 --> 04:08.744
You think
Jack might try to contact Kevin.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.963
- It's a possibility.
- Oh, my God, or he might...

04:11.051 --> 04:12.842
I'm gonna go out front.

04:12.928 --> 04:14.447
I'll take you out in a few minutes, Kevin.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.629
- I can go by myself.
- We're almost done.

04:16.723 --> 04:17.754
I wanna go now.

04:17.849 --> 04:20.803
With that attitude
you're not going anywhere.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.385
Nice board. Mind if I check it out?

04:23.980 --> 04:25.640
Yeah, I do.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.152
- He's angry.
- Yeah. I don't blame him.

04:31.238 --> 04:35.152
All he does is ride that skateboard
or sit by himself and draw.

04:35.784 --> 04:38.191
His father
is probably running for a border.

04:38.286 --> 04:40.493
But I'm gonna leave Agent Todd here
for a while.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.367
If the phone rings, you let her answer it.

04:47.003 --> 04:49.210
- You on a roll?
- Aren't I always?

04:49.297 --> 04:52.417
- Guess you don't need this, then, huh?
- You need it, I like it.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.945
Kate get you the stuff from Curtin's cell?

04:53.969 --> 04:57.005
- It's on its way. Kate rules.
- Thought Abby ruled.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.089
Good women
don't mind sharing a throne, Gibbs.

04:59.182 --> 05:00.863
How about just
sharing what you found, Abs?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.428
I will, when I find it.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.306
I'm still downloading the SAINT data
from Leavenworth.

05:05.397 --> 05:08.018
- That's one acronym I don't know.
- It's like LoJack for inmates.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.025
It should be able to tell us when
and where our chicken flew the coop.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.172
I am much more interested in how,
and with whose help.

05:13.196 --> 05:14.572
- Got it.
- Good.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.361
I haven't had anything to do
with Petty Officer Curtin

05:21.454 --> 05:23.032
since I prosecuted the case.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.433
Where'd he run after the murders?

05:24.457 --> 05:27.542
He didn't.
He was the one who called the police.

05:28.420 --> 05:31.539
- He called the police on himself?
- Insisted he was innocent.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.291
Claimed he came home
and found them dead.

05:33.383 --> 05:34.498
Victim of circumstance.

05:34.593 --> 05:37.593
He said his wife might have been
involved with drug dealers.

05:37.679 --> 05:39.304
It all fell apart pretty fast.

05:39.389 --> 05:41.382
- He end up confessing?
- No.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.661
But he had both victims' blood
all over him,

05:43.685 --> 05:45.594
and his fingerprints
were on the murder weapon.

05:45.687 --> 05:47.081
It was pretty obvious what happened.

05:47.105 --> 05:50.106
He came home, found his wife upstairs
with the cable guy, and lost it.

05:50.191 --> 05:53.276
Guess he picked the wrong housewife
to give a free upgrade, huh?

05:53.361 --> 05:55.769
Is that your idea of humour,
Special Agent DiNozzo?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.030
Is that your idea of a sharp pencil?

05:58.617 --> 06:00.360
You know which one I'm talking about.

06:00.535 --> 06:02.528
Not gonna poke anyone's eye out
with that one.

06:02.829 --> 06:06.578
- Are we finished here?
- Was the cable guy doing the missus?

06:08.043 --> 06:10.960
Actually, he really was
just fixing the cable.

06:11.046 --> 06:13.691
- Curtin was just paranoid and freaked.
- Why wasn't he on death row?

06:13.715 --> 06:16.502
He was granted leniency
due to post-traumatic stress.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.004
From the cable going out?

06:19.095 --> 06:20.340
Slightly amusing?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.473
Come on, Counsellor,

06:22.557 --> 06:25.095
you gotta give me something
to work with here.

06:25.185 --> 06:29.432
- I have clients to see, Agent DiNozzo.
- Why did Curtin freak?

06:29.522 --> 06:31.432
Everyone thinks
because the Taliban fell fast,

06:31.524 --> 06:32.604
it was a cakewalk.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.981
But for the guys over there,
it was anything but.

06:35.070 --> 06:38.320
Anybody testify on his behalf?
Someone he would go to for help?

06:38.406 --> 06:40.778
Curtin heloed into Afghanistan
on September 12th

06:40.867 --> 06:43.903
with nothing but an MP5,
a K-Bar knife, and a radio.

06:43.995 --> 06:47.281
Doesn't strike me
as the kind of guy who needs help.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.075
I appreciate your help,

06:51.086 --> 06:52.746
Commander Coleman.

06:53.421 --> 06:55.414
It's been a lot of laughs.

07:00.679 --> 07:02.303
Now that's funny.

07:06.768 --> 07:09.555
Petty Officer First Class Jack Curtin.
He's hard-core, boss.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.760
Yeah?

07:10.855 --> 07:12.599
What's your definition of hard-core?

07:12.691 --> 07:15.561
Grew up in foster homes. Enlisted at 17.

07:15.652 --> 07:18.439
Went from boot camp to BUDS,
which is unusual.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.937
Went through hell in Afghanistan,
which apparently isn't.

07:21.032 --> 07:23.191
His entire SEAL team
showed up at his trial

07:23.284 --> 07:24.483
as character witnesses.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.784
- Where's his team now?
- Mostly deployed.

07:26.871 --> 07:28.057
Tony, I'm going to need you to go...

07:28.081 --> 07:30.786
Track them down,
and see if Curtin contacted them?

07:30.875 --> 07:32.998
Or I could let you finish your question.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.995
You have the name
of the team commander?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.796
- Current or past?
- Both.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.589
Current's location is classified.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.082
Satcom can be arranged
as soon as he becomes available

07:41.177 --> 07:43.170
- and when that'll be is...
- Classified.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.461
Unknown.

07:44.556 --> 07:47.473
Past is stationed at Little Creek.
A Commander William Foley.

07:47.559 --> 07:50.014
Where exactly at Little Creek?

07:54.399 --> 07:55.941
There, exactly.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.268
It's a brave new world, boss.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.531
Well, if he's looking for help
from an old teammate,

08:04.617 --> 08:06.575
he'll have to go to Iraq to get it.

08:07.245 --> 08:10.080
- You're here.
- Hazards of promotion.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.435
Have you had any contact with Curtin
since his conviction?

08:12.459 --> 08:14.950
No. Not that I'd avoid it.

08:15.545 --> 08:17.205
Jack was a good man.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.206
He's convicted of killing two people.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.544
Agent Gibbs,

08:22.343 --> 08:24.304
you know what it's like
to spend every free moment

08:24.345 --> 08:26.137
dreaming about being home again,

08:26.222 --> 08:28.262
hugging your wife,
hearing your kids laugh,

08:28.349 --> 08:30.472
only to come home
and learn it's all gone?

08:30.894 --> 08:32.471
It doesn't justify murder.

08:32.854 --> 08:34.134
I didn't say it did.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.804
Anything else?

08:36.482 --> 08:37.645
Not for the moment.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.479
That's very Jack Webb.

08:41.738 --> 08:42.769
Thanks.

08:43.198 --> 08:45.024
Curtin definitely did his homework.

08:45.116 --> 08:46.837
You got my attention, Abs.
How'd he get out?

08:46.910 --> 08:49.151
According to the computer, he didn't.

08:49.245 --> 08:50.656
I hate riddles.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.989
SAINT tracks both inmates and guards

08:53.083 --> 08:55.574
through a single source data system
that compares information

08:55.668 --> 08:58.539
on a digital smartcard
that every inmate is required to carry,

08:58.630 --> 09:00.836
with some aspect of their physiology.

09:00.924 --> 09:05.218
How about an explanation
that doesn't require a digital smartcard?

09:05.303 --> 09:06.583
Okay.

09:06.679 --> 09:10.547
You got a fingerprint. You got a card.
You swipe, you press, match-match.

09:10.642 --> 09:12.718
The computer knows who you are
and where you are.

09:12.811 --> 09:14.388
The readers are in every cell

09:14.479 --> 09:16.518
and every entryway
to locations within the prison.

09:16.606 --> 09:19.441
So there's no need
for bed checks or roll calls.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.602
You save time, you save money.
Everybody wins.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.402
Until an inmate hacks the system.

09:23.488 --> 09:24.863
Until an inmate hacks the system.

09:24.948 --> 09:26.110
It was maximum security.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.524
They don't get pencils,
much less a laptop.

09:28.618 --> 09:32.034
Yes, but they do give them toothpaste.

09:33.957 --> 09:36.530
At first, I thought he molded
a duplicate of his finger,

09:36.626 --> 09:38.168
- but...
- It's a guard's finger.

09:38.253 --> 09:41.372
That's what I love about you, Gibbs.
Always one finger ahead.

09:41.464 --> 09:44.134
- Find out which guard.
- I already have.

09:44.634 --> 09:47.255
SAINT had the guard logged
at the prison laundry

09:47.345 --> 09:48.720
for the last 22 hours.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.264
Which is odd for several reasons,

09:50.348 --> 09:52.222
but especially because
it was his day off.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.217
Curtin used the fake finger
to get to the laundry.

09:55.311 --> 09:58.099
And he hid in a hamper,
and he went out with the whites.

09:58.189 --> 10:00.182
How'd he get the guard's finger
to make the mold?

10:00.275 --> 10:03.145
Easy. Kicked sand in his face.
Watch this.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.446
Curtin did a few fingertip pull-ups,

10:10.535 --> 10:13.452
and then challenged the guard
to do the same.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.085
And I'm guessing
that's not dirt he found above the door.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.523
And I'm guessing that
you're looking in the wrong direction,

10:22.547 --> 10:25.382
just like the guard. Watch.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.561
So a finger he made of this
fooled the computer.

10:38.646 --> 10:41.433
The biometric readers note lines
and ridges in three dimensions.

10:41.524 --> 10:42.668
They don't check for a pulse.

10:42.692 --> 10:44.837
A finger's useless
without the smartcard that goes with it.

10:44.861 --> 10:48.396
The guard lost his card
two weeks after Curtin arrived.

10:48.489 --> 10:52.024
In the incident report,
he claimed that his dog ate it.

10:52.243 --> 10:53.762
It didn't work for me in the sixth grade.

10:53.786 --> 10:57.037
You're a late bloomer, Gibbs.
It didn't work for me in the second.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.329
They don't have a way
to disable lost cards?

10:59.417 --> 11:00.448
They do, but they didn't.

11:00.543 --> 11:03.628
- Guess they figured without the finger...
- Exactly.

11:03.713 --> 11:06.204
Well, they fingered wrong.

11:25.860 --> 11:26.891
McGee.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.943
Kate. Checking out a noise
in the kitchen.

11:29.030 --> 11:30.310
Roger. Standing by.

11:57.225 --> 11:59.763
Kevin, what are you doing?

11:59.852 --> 12:00.884
Nothing.

12:02.063 --> 12:03.094
Oh, jeez.

12:05.775 --> 12:07.020
Code 4, McGee.

12:07.110 --> 12:09.186
- Just a little spilt milk.
- Roger, that.

12:11.114 --> 12:14.031
You've gotta get back to bed, buddy.
It's late.

12:14.117 --> 12:16.109
- I'm hungry.
- Have a piece of fruit.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.233
I hate fruit.

12:18.121 --> 12:19.152
Bananas.

12:19.247 --> 12:22.331
They're the closest thing
to not being a fruit that a fruit can be.

12:22.417 --> 12:24.955
I don't know what that means, either.
Just go to bed.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.203
What about the floor?
If my grandma sees this, she...

12:27.297 --> 12:29.966
Don't worry about the floor.
I got it, okay?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.591
It's not a big deal, all right?

12:31.884 --> 12:32.916
I've got the floor.

12:33.011 --> 12:35.336
You just need to go back to bed
for me, okay...

12:36.556 --> 12:37.801
One word,

12:38.891 --> 12:42.557
and the milk won't be
the only thing spilled on the floor.

12:50.219 --> 12:51.863
The whole neighbourhood
is under surveillance.

12:51.887 --> 12:53.761
You'll never get away with him.

12:54.265 --> 12:56.590
I didn't come here to take him away.

12:56.684 --> 12:58.760
I came to say goodbye.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.587
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.605
You could've just called, written a letter.

13:05.025 --> 13:06.306
You don't have kids, do you?

13:07.319 --> 13:08.778
He needs to know that I love him,

13:08.863 --> 13:10.584
and that this is the best place
for him now.

13:10.614 --> 13:12.821
So you can run away
without feeling guilty?

13:13.159 --> 13:14.701
I shouldn't have to run at all.

13:16.871 --> 13:19.622
Open your mouth. Open wide. Okay.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.867
There you go. It's not too tight.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.468
Is it scary in jail?

13:41.520 --> 13:42.849
Sometimes.

13:43.397 --> 13:45.971
'Cause there's guys bigger than you?

13:47.485 --> 13:48.599
Well,

13:50.196 --> 13:51.904
there's a lot of different reasons.

13:54.283 --> 13:55.742
You think about your mom a lot?

13:56.535 --> 13:57.614
Yeah.

13:59.079 --> 14:00.324
So do I.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.585
Kate. McGee. You got a sitrep for me?

14:09.215 --> 14:11.207
Kate, you there? Come in.

14:13.385 --> 14:14.630
No, don't go.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.796
- I have to.
- No, Dad, please.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.513
Radio check. Kate, you there?

14:30.611 --> 14:32.651
- Where is he?
- In the back bedroom with Kevin.

14:32.738 --> 14:33.769
My hands.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.273
Give me your phone.

14:39.328 --> 14:40.870
This is NCIS Special Agent Todd.

14:40.955 --> 14:42.864
We need immediate assistance
at 10600 Vincent.

14:42.957 --> 14:45.329
We've got an armed federal escapee
inside the house.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.604
Clear.

15:10.693 --> 15:12.068
You can't shoot him!

15:12.778 --> 15:14.023
Oh, man.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.355
- Come here, bud.
- What's going on?

15:16.448 --> 15:17.693
He was here, now he's gone.

15:17.783 --> 15:18.946
No!

15:19.034 --> 15:20.066
- Kevin?
- It's okay.

15:20.202 --> 15:21.471
- Kevin, you all right?
- Let me go.

15:21.495 --> 15:23.014
Go after him.
I'm gonna go back out front

15:23.038 --> 15:24.199
and see if he parked his car.

15:24.248 --> 15:25.790
No. Tell them you found his car.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.282
On the radio, notify the team,
tell them you found his car,

15:28.377 --> 15:29.540
and you got it covered.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.787
Kevin, do you know
where your father's going?

15:31.881 --> 15:33.458
Bravo 4, this is Bravo 1.

15:33.549 --> 15:34.794
We've found Curtin's vehicle.

15:34.884 --> 15:36.486
Got it covered.
Repeat, we have found his vehicle.

15:36.510 --> 15:37.708
- Standing by.
- Copy that.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.048
- Damn.
- You think it'll work?

15:39.138 --> 15:40.217
We'll find out.

15:40.431 --> 15:41.759
It's okay.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.469
Stop! Get out of the car now!
Get out of the car!

15:48.564 --> 15:49.939
Okay. Okay.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.147
Out of the way!

16:30.522 --> 16:32.562
- Checkpoints up?
- On all the major roads.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.900
APB went out on the car.
He got away in at 0400.

16:35.986 --> 16:38.857
One of the deputies just found
an old pickup with Missouri plates.

16:38.948 --> 16:41.735
- Reported stolen yesterday morning.
- Sounds like our guy's.

16:41.825 --> 16:43.226
Impound it? Bring it to the garage?

16:43.285 --> 16:45.305
No, there's no time.
Bag everything, get it to Abby.

16:45.329 --> 16:47.535
- Will do, sir.
- Bag the windshield fragments, too.

16:47.623 --> 16:50.196
Get them to Abby. Then take photos.

16:50.292 --> 16:51.703
Both scenes.

16:52.461 --> 16:54.039
What're you doing down here?

16:54.129 --> 16:56.703
Oh, main office
needed a temporary refill.

16:57.508 --> 17:01.375
- I was low on the pole.
- Yeah, we got a lot of people out sick.

17:01.470 --> 17:05.219
Some kind of gastrointestinal bug
going around.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.433
You didn't use our toilet, did you?

17:16.777 --> 17:18.604
Curtin snuck in last night.
I didn't hear him.

17:18.695 --> 17:20.106
He came to say goodbye to his boy.

17:20.196 --> 17:21.608
And while he was saying goodbye?

17:22.616 --> 17:25.451
I was tied up in the living room.

17:27.121 --> 17:28.152
He has my weapon.

17:29.164 --> 17:30.623
But I hit him with the shotgun.

17:30.958 --> 17:32.452
- How bad?
- Don't know.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.168
Contact the ERs in the area.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.962
Tell them to be on the lookout
for a GSV.

17:37.047 --> 17:38.839
- And get them Curtin's photo.
- Okay.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.549
- Where's the boy?
- In his room.

17:47.349 --> 17:49.306
- You think he swam?
- Who?

17:49.393 --> 17:50.971
Leavenworth's in Kansas.

17:52.354 --> 17:53.848
The truck's from Missouri.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.311
Little thing called the Mississippi
between the two.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.899
Well, actually
there's a little thing called 200 miles

17:59.987 --> 18:01.896
between Leavenworth
and the Mississippi.

18:01.989 --> 18:03.103
Try the Missouri.

18:03.198 --> 18:06.116
Same thing. Potato, potato.

18:09.788 --> 18:13.157
All we know is,
this guy swam across a big-ass river.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.078
You enjoy this, don't you?

18:15.711 --> 18:18.166
- Having fun at your expense?
- Yeah.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.044
Really a lot.

18:32.686 --> 18:34.679
Are you gonna arrest me?

18:34.855 --> 18:36.100
For helping your dad?

18:36.815 --> 18:37.846
No.

18:38.358 --> 18:40.647
We don't arrest boys for that.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.145
Thought you might be hungry.

18:48.535 --> 18:50.847
You know, when I was a kid,
we used to take roller skates apart

18:50.871 --> 18:54.205
and nail them onto boards.
Pretty unbelievable, huh?

18:55.876 --> 18:58.034
Yeah, I'd be speechless, too.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.955
I'm gonna guess that's your dad.

19:02.674 --> 19:06.209
- Is he going to shoot someone, Kevin?
- Don't wanna talk about it.

19:09.431 --> 19:11.091
I understand that.

19:13.727 --> 19:16.562
Hardest thing for guys like us is talking.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.897
What do you mean, "guys like us"?

19:20.609 --> 19:23.230
I don't know,
you just seem a little bottled up.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.274
Like me.

19:28.158 --> 19:31.527
Everyone thinks I should just spew,
you know?

19:31.745 --> 19:33.405
Yeah.

19:33.747 --> 19:35.656
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.082
What are you bottled up about?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.666
I let a guy get away from me.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.969
Bad guy. He shot one of my people.

19:50.264 --> 19:51.972
- Shot me.
- Where?

19:54.810 --> 19:56.470
Bothers me that I can't find him.

19:58.981 --> 20:00.938
But I'm gonna find him.

20:07.072 --> 20:09.195
I'm not gonna help you catch my dad.

20:10.033 --> 20:11.444
That's okay.

20:20.627 --> 20:22.335
Oh, yeah. That's okay.

20:26.675 --> 20:28.169
"Ladies and gentlemen,

20:28.552 --> 20:29.963
"I want a hard-target search

20:30.053 --> 20:32.461
"of every residence, gas station,
farmhouse, hen house,

20:32.556 --> 20:35.011
"doghouse and outhouse in the area,
you got that?

20:35.100 --> 20:39.180
"Good! Now, turn off those cameras
and get out of the way."

20:39.605 --> 20:41.182
Accent's still not right.

20:41.523 --> 20:42.554
Damn!

20:42.649 --> 20:44.772
It's too Arkansas,
Tommy Lee's more Texas.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.852
You got to think more untamed,
in-your-face.

20:51.992 --> 20:54.032
Where's the stuff from Curtin's car?

20:54.119 --> 20:56.871
It's there,
but you're gonna wanna see this first.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.284
I haven't done a precipitin yet,

20:58.373 --> 21:00.247
but unless someone else
was shot recently

21:00.334 --> 21:02.872
inside the car that Curtin carjacked,

21:02.961 --> 21:05.203
I think Kate just unsealed our SEAL.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.171
- First shot, too.
- How can you tell?

21:07.257 --> 21:09.250
See the crenellated marks?

21:09.885 --> 21:12.802
That's caused from blood spray
hitting a perpendicular surface

21:12.888 --> 21:15.557
- at a pretty good clip.
- How do you know it's the first shot?

21:15.641 --> 21:16.803
The first shot hit home

21:16.892 --> 21:18.745
and caused the blood to splatter
inside the car.

21:18.769 --> 21:19.883
The second...

21:19.978 --> 21:21.372
Blasted the stained glass
onto the street.

21:21.396 --> 21:24.267
Stained glass.
That's very spiritual, Gibbs.

21:26.026 --> 21:27.306
How severe a wound?

21:27.402 --> 21:29.775
From a close-range blast
with a double-ought buck,

21:29.863 --> 21:31.737
and considering his position
behind the wheel,

21:31.823 --> 21:33.946
and the fact that
he hasn't turned up dead yet,

21:34.034 --> 21:38.245
I'd say that he probably just got grazed,
or he's down to one arm.

21:38.747 --> 21:40.740
What're you looking for?

21:42.501 --> 21:44.908
- This.
- It's from the glove compartment.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.292
Yeah, never known anyone
who'd keep gloves in there.

21:47.381 --> 21:48.579
Well, now you do.

21:48.674 --> 21:49.817
- You wanna know why?
- Not really.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.027
- I don't like the sun.
- Abby.

21:51.051 --> 21:52.528
So, when I have to go put gas in my car,

21:52.552 --> 21:54.462
I have these vintage
elbow-length gloves.

21:54.554 --> 21:55.634
Black?

21:55.722 --> 21:58.640
Yes, they match
my black lace vintage parasol.

21:58.725 --> 21:59.805
At a gas station?

21:59.893 --> 22:01.371
Well, yeah.
You can't be too careful, Gibbs,

22:01.395 --> 22:03.790
and you can't have an indoor gas station
'cause of all the fumes.

22:03.814 --> 22:05.012
- Abby?
- Yeah.

22:05.107 --> 22:06.933
- Can we move on?
- Sure.

22:09.152 --> 22:11.026
It's a map of Washington, DC.

22:11.613 --> 22:13.357
- The new one.
- So?

22:13.448 --> 22:15.026
This one isn't.

22:15.117 --> 22:16.196
My guess is,

22:16.285 --> 22:19.120
he didn't know he had a DC map
in the glove compartment,

22:19.204 --> 22:20.367
so he bought a new one.

22:22.457 --> 22:25.127
Kevin obviously thinks
his dad is out to shoot somebody.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.286
He told me
his dad has gotta find someone

22:27.379 --> 22:29.857
- and then he's gonna give himself up.
- Does he know who it is?

22:29.881 --> 22:32.966
No. But he seems to know something
about the plan after he finds him.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.380
If Curtin's like most inmates,

22:34.469 --> 22:36.509
he blames everyone but himself
for his conviction.

22:36.596 --> 22:38.922
There was a new DC road map
in the car he abandoned.

22:39.016 --> 22:41.933
Both of the JAG lawyers
involved in his trial had DC addresses.

22:42.019 --> 22:44.640
- What about the judge?
- Retired. Lives in El Paso.

22:45.522 --> 22:47.515
Curtin also did right by all three of them.

22:47.607 --> 22:51.226
Coleman didn't even contest
the post-traumatic stress diagnosis.

22:51.820 --> 22:54.441
Plus, the judge was lenient
in sentencing.

22:54.531 --> 22:55.811
So, who's he after?

22:55.907 --> 22:57.983
Curtin told me
he shouldn't have to run at all.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.820
He's always insisted he was innocent.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.991
So, you're saying we should be looking
for a one-armed man.

23:03.081 --> 23:05.240
- Very funny.
- Maybe we should.

23:05.334 --> 23:06.496
Are you kidding, boss?

23:06.585 --> 23:08.957
The repairman
really was fixing the cable,

23:09.046 --> 23:11.334
the lawyers were professional,
the judge was fair.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.831
Maybe the one person
that Curtin still has a beef with

23:13.925 --> 23:15.550
is the one who killed his wife.

23:15.635 --> 23:17.260
He's not running.

23:19.056 --> 23:20.514
He's chasing.

23:25.929 --> 23:27.886
Nothing from area hospitals.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.760
Still checking smaller clinics,
as well as doctors' offices.

23:30.850 --> 23:33.602
- He could have seen a vet.
- Tony's marking that territory.

23:34.771 --> 23:35.850
- Cute.
- I thought so.

23:35.939 --> 23:37.267
I didn't.

23:37.357 --> 23:40.477
- Nothing from the vets, boss.
- APB on the car?

23:40.569 --> 23:42.691
- Nothing.
- Tired of hearing that word.

23:44.948 --> 23:47.949
- We think Curtin's innocent, right?
- Maybe.

23:48.034 --> 23:49.943
Assume he's innocent,
for the sake of argument.

23:50.036 --> 23:52.278
- Why?
- Because I said to.

23:52.372 --> 23:54.412
- Innocent. Sure. Why not?
- Go on.

23:54.499 --> 23:55.780
If Curtin's innocent,

23:55.875 --> 23:57.687
and he's going after the guy
that murdered his wife

23:57.711 --> 23:58.790
and the cable repairman...

23:58.878 --> 24:01.500
I don't think he cares
about the cable repairman.

24:02.215 --> 24:04.007
If Curtin knows the murderer,

24:04.092 --> 24:05.752
why didn't he say so
when he was arrested?

24:05.844 --> 24:09.427
He did. He said he thought
it might have been drug dealers.

24:09.514 --> 24:11.471
Generic. Not specific.

24:11.558 --> 24:14.475
He's going out
to get someone specific now.

24:14.561 --> 24:15.640
He didn't know.

24:15.729 --> 24:18.350
He found out who slit their throats
while he was in prison.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.080
What about the stuff
that was in his cell?

24:20.108 --> 24:21.388
Be here in 20 minutes.

24:21.484 --> 24:24.189
But I have a list
of everything that's coming.

24:24.362 --> 24:28.063
Curtin's cell had seven large file boxes

24:28.158 --> 24:32.736
containing appeals, police reports,
detective notes, crime scene photos,

24:32.829 --> 24:35.154
phone records
and an official trial record.

24:35.248 --> 24:36.726
He found something
in one of those boxes

24:36.750 --> 24:39.241
- that told him who killed his wife.
- If he's innocent.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.284
We're gonna reinvestigate this case,
from top to bottom.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.503
Get both of those JAG lawyers in here.

24:44.591 --> 24:47.675
Kate, take prosecution. Tony, defence.

24:47.761 --> 24:49.089
- On it.
- On it.

24:49.179 --> 24:50.258
Central Files.

24:50.347 --> 24:52.672
I need all our records on a murder case,
three years ago.

24:52.766 --> 24:55.517
- Hi...
- Petty Officer First Class Jack D. Curtin.

24:55.602 --> 24:57.678
I wanna know
who here investigated the case.

24:57.979 --> 25:00.684
No. No, you will not call me back.
I'll hold.

25:00.774 --> 25:02.414
This is Special Agent Kate Todd
from NCIS.

25:02.484 --> 25:04.607
What the hell are you doing?

25:08.365 --> 25:10.690
Can you form a sentence,
Agent McGee?

25:10.784 --> 25:15.244
NCIS investigator was
Special Agent Clay Williamson, sir.

25:15.330 --> 25:18.533
- That's a good sentence.
- He's retired and living on a boat.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.997
Gets his mail every three months
in Tahiti.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.707
- What kind of boat?
- I don't know, sir.

25:23.797 --> 25:27.746
But I was able to download
his investigation from Central Files.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.549
I want the evidence custody document
so we can get...

25:31.638 --> 25:32.717
Already got it, sir.

25:32.806 --> 25:35.641
I can call Norfolk
and have the evidence transferred here.

25:35.725 --> 25:36.840
How fast?

25:36.935 --> 25:39.556
Joint Forces Command
has a helo shuttle to the Pentagon.

25:39.646 --> 25:40.891
- Do it.
- Okay, yes, sir.

25:40.980 --> 25:43.518
- You don't have to call me "sir."
- No, sir.

25:43.608 --> 25:44.723
Lawyers?

25:44.818 --> 25:47.487
Commander Coleman
is unhappily on her way.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.230
The defence lawyer told me to shove it.

25:49.322 --> 25:51.564
The message was actually delivered
by his assistant,

25:51.658 --> 25:53.318
but he assured me it was verbatim.

25:53.410 --> 25:56.327
- I want him here, DiNozzo.
- Boss, he's no longer a JAG.

25:56.413 --> 25:59.947
He's a $400-an-hour Beltway lawyer
with really nice shoes.

26:00.041 --> 26:01.452
DiNozzo, I don't care.

26:01.543 --> 26:05.410
I don't care
if he's wearing Armani or Prada,

26:05.505 --> 26:09.170
or Ermen-something Zegna.
Get his ass here!

26:09.259 --> 26:12.094
It's Ermenegildo Zegna, boss.

26:13.430 --> 26:15.090
Just so you know.

26:15.181 --> 26:17.055
Evidence is on its way,

26:18.268 --> 26:19.382
boss.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.764
I'm gonna own your house,
Agent DiNozzo.

26:23.273 --> 26:24.435
I rent.

26:24.524 --> 26:26.066
You know what
the federal minimums are

26:26.151 --> 26:28.274
for aggravated assault
under cover of authority,

26:28.361 --> 26:30.318
kidnapping, false imprisonment?

26:30.405 --> 26:31.685
Well, you know, I don't,

26:31.781 --> 26:35.281
but I'm sure my boss,
Special Agent Jethro Gibbs, does.

26:36.619 --> 26:38.162
Very subtle, DiNozzo.

26:38.246 --> 26:40.452
Shooting him
just seemed so ham-fisted.

26:40.540 --> 26:41.785
Whatever it takes.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.334
Uncuff him
so he can say hello to an old friend.

26:48.631 --> 26:50.505
I prefer him in cuffs.

26:50.884 --> 26:53.838
Wish I'd have known that
when we were at JAG.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.757
I want every photograph,
witness statement,

26:58.850 --> 27:00.558
lab report, autopsy report,

27:00.643 --> 27:03.644
and anything else you find
in these boxes re-examined.

27:03.730 --> 27:05.473
Petty Officer Curtin
may be innocent now,

27:05.565 --> 27:08.519
but if we don't find who he's after,
he will not be for long.

27:08.610 --> 27:09.724
Innocent?

27:09.819 --> 27:13.603
I believe Curtin told his son
that he escaped from jail

27:13.698 --> 27:15.691
to get the person
who murdered his mother.

27:15.784 --> 27:19.402
And what was he going to tell his son,
"I murdered your mother"?

27:19.496 --> 27:21.453
You had no eyewitnesses,
no confession.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.142
I had enough evidence
to get a conviction.

27:23.166 --> 27:27.543
Guilty or innocent, you are both here
to help us find who he is after

27:27.629 --> 27:29.039
before another murder is committed.

27:29.130 --> 27:32.748
Okay. If Curtin can prove he's innocent,
why didn't he just tell the authorities?

27:32.842 --> 27:35.001
- Would you listen?
- No, but if I was innocent,

27:35.094 --> 27:36.968
I'd keep telling people
until someone did.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.806
I wouldn't escape from prison
and go after the killer myself.

27:39.891 --> 27:41.535
That's why women
aren't allowed in the SEALs.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.468
Because we think
with the head on our shoulders?

27:44.479 --> 27:45.973
They remind you of anybody?

27:46.815 --> 27:48.060
- No.
- No.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.561
Me, neither.

27:51.152 --> 27:52.812
Evidence from Norfolk.

27:52.904 --> 27:54.184
Top box is autopsy.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.237
The rest is evidence
collected at the scene.

27:56.324 --> 27:59.610
Top box goes on the table for Ducky.
Everything else goes to the lab.

27:59.702 --> 28:01.778
- You take Abby with you.
- I'm on her.

28:02.497 --> 28:04.739
It. I'm on it, sir.

28:05.542 --> 28:06.870
I'm sorry.

28:09.128 --> 28:10.955
No drugs found in either victim's blood.

28:11.047 --> 28:12.728
Special Agent Williamson,
who investigated,

28:12.757 --> 28:14.631
found he's sailing
a 13-meter ketch, boss.

28:14.717 --> 28:16.675
Must be married.
You can't single-hand a ketch.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.572
Take it you're not building a ketch
in your basement.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.921
Of course not.
The basement's too small.

28:21.015 --> 28:22.493
Know what,
if I was getting $500 an hour

28:22.517 --> 28:24.723
I wouldn't care
how long this little sidebar went on,

28:24.811 --> 28:26.720
but since I'm here pro bono, can we...

28:26.813 --> 28:28.640
Special Agent Williamson
had a drug tox screen

28:28.731 --> 28:30.475
done on the wife's hair. Nothing.

28:30.567 --> 28:33.603
Okay. Curtin's drug dealer idea
didn't pan out. What did?

28:33.695 --> 28:35.695
Curtin was convinced
his wife was having an affair.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.358
Petty Officer Curtin was paranoid.

28:37.448 --> 28:39.927
First, drug dealers did it.
When that didn't pan out, it was a lover.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.196
Was he paranoid?

28:41.286 --> 28:42.400
- No.
- Yes.

28:42.495 --> 28:44.618
- Proof?
- Pass this, please.

28:44.706 --> 28:46.081
The court-appointed psychiatrist

28:46.165 --> 28:49.166
found Curtin experienced
severe insomnia in Afghanistan.

28:49.252 --> 28:51.743
- Who didn't?
- Sleep deprivation can cause paranoia.

28:51.838 --> 28:53.830
So can a wife
who's cutting another guy's jib.

28:53.923 --> 28:56.248
Curtin's the type of guy
who intimidates other SEALs.

28:56.342 --> 28:57.736
Who's gonna make a move on his wife?

28:57.760 --> 28:59.303
Maybe she was the one
making the moves.

28:59.387 --> 29:00.965
Where are her phone records?

29:01.055 --> 29:02.992
There was nothing in them
to indicate she had a lover.

29:03.016 --> 29:04.724
Unfortunately, she's right.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.478
I checked out every number
she called while he was overseas.

29:07.562 --> 29:10.124
- Did you check her cell phone calls?
- She didn't have a cell phone.

29:10.148 --> 29:11.891
- That's odd.
- Everyone has a cell phone.

29:11.983 --> 29:14.189
- I have a cell phone.
- Well, she didn't.

29:14.277 --> 29:15.937
Evidently her husband thought she did.

29:16.029 --> 29:18.029
He subpoenaed every
cell phone company in Virginia.

29:18.114 --> 29:21.565
Verizon, Sprint, AT&T Wireless.
And there's more.

29:21.659 --> 29:24.115
These are subpoenas
for prepaid cell phone providers.

29:24.203 --> 29:26.492
Floor 4 Wireless, Bingham Wireless,

29:26.581 --> 29:30.531
sharkphone. Com,
zophone. Com, nophone. Com...

29:31.377 --> 29:33.085
Houston, the cell phone has landed.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.163
Prepaid cell phone records
for one Margaret Curtin

29:35.256 --> 29:37.130
from upfrontphone. Com.

29:37.216 --> 29:40.301
And the date on the subpoena
was four weeks ago.

29:43.723 --> 29:45.098
Court's adjourned.

29:45.183 --> 29:46.891
Thanks
for your cooperation, Counsellors.

29:46.976 --> 29:50.677
Special Agent Todd will escort you out.
Tony, get on those numbers.

29:51.564 --> 29:54.055
- You'll let me know how this turns out?
- Of course.

29:54.150 --> 29:57.982
Afraid you put an innocent man
in Leavenworth, Faith?

29:58.071 --> 30:01.605
Yes. But innocent or not,
I still kicked your ass.

30:09.415 --> 30:12.167
- Hey, Pacci.
- Tony! How's the shoulder?

30:12.251 --> 30:13.687
- Getting there.
- You got a minute, Gibbs?

30:13.711 --> 30:15.585
- No, not really.
- Been working a hot case?

30:15.672 --> 30:16.917
Smoking!

30:17.006 --> 30:19.544
Tony, I'm gonna check on Ducky,
then Abby.

30:19.634 --> 30:22.404
- Give me a... Call me the second...
- I find anything. I got it, boss.

30:22.428 --> 30:23.709
Pacci?

30:24.180 --> 30:26.967
- What do you need?
- No, you're busy. It's a cold case.

30:27.058 --> 30:28.173
What's one more day?

30:32.855 --> 30:35.607
I think I got something useful
from his accent.

30:36.192 --> 30:38.648
- What?
- The terrorist.

30:38.736 --> 30:43.279
He had a definite Euro accent,
but he occasionally used British syntax.

30:43.366 --> 30:46.071
I think his higher education
was in the British Isles.

30:47.453 --> 30:50.953
Yeah. Well, that's all I have
for the moment on that bastard.

30:51.165 --> 30:56.123
But on the one who did these murders,
I've just found something really useful.

30:56.212 --> 30:59.581
The ME misread the cause of death.

31:00.591 --> 31:02.216
You'd think it was so obvious.

31:02.760 --> 31:06.129
A massive loss of blood
from a kitchen knife.

31:06.931 --> 31:10.347
I mean, he sliced them from ear to ear.
The attack was so vicious,

31:10.435 --> 31:12.676
that both victims
were nearly decapitated.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.248
- That didn't cause their death?
- No.

31:14.272 --> 31:17.723
The ME missed that they both also

31:19.694 --> 31:23.193
had fractures of the cervical spine.

31:23.656 --> 31:26.361
- Their necks were broken.
- Precisely. Yes.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.527
The killer incapacitated each victim

31:28.619 --> 31:32.154
with a violent, and most likely fatal,
twist of the head.

31:32.248 --> 31:35.699
- Duck, I get the idea.
- Anyway, he slit their throats.

31:36.002 --> 31:39.952
Probably, to cover up the fact
that he knew how to kill with his hands.

31:40.048 --> 31:42.455
- Like a Navy SEAL.
- Yes.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.256
Which brings us back
to Petty Officer Curtin.

31:45.386 --> 31:49.087
- I've said all along, he's guilty.
- Nothing in her cell phone records?

31:49.182 --> 31:51.102
If she got that cell phone
to call her boyfriend,

31:51.142 --> 31:53.342
then he's working at the video store,
the grocery store,

31:53.394 --> 31:56.597
the hairdresser, the dry cleaner,
or directory assistance.

31:56.689 --> 31:58.812
She only got the phone
when her husband shipped out.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.540
What's the most frequently
dialled number?

32:00.568 --> 32:02.810
- Commander Foley's house.
- Curtin's CO?

32:03.362 --> 32:05.189
Only he was in Afghanistan with Curtin.

32:05.281 --> 32:07.606
Mrs Foley confirmed
Margaret Curtin called frequently,

32:07.700 --> 32:09.859
but it wasn't unusual.
All the wives did it.

32:09.952 --> 32:12.823
The CO's wife's the den mother
when the unit's deployed.

32:12.914 --> 32:13.993
It's a dead end, boss.

32:14.082 --> 32:17.118
That cell phone log is the only record
Curtin had that no one else did,

32:17.210 --> 32:19.451
and he got that just before he escaped.

32:19.545 --> 32:21.668
Whoever he is chasing
is at one of those numbers.

32:21.756 --> 32:24.211
We just have to find out which one.

32:28.763 --> 32:30.074
If she was cheating on her husband,

32:30.098 --> 32:32.076
do you really think
she'd tell the Commander's wife?

32:32.100 --> 32:33.980
Not if she's anything
like the den mother I had.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.895
- Talk about your bÍte noires.
- You were a Boy Scout?

32:37.438 --> 32:38.517
Cub.

32:39.899 --> 32:41.856
What'd they kick you out for?

32:41.943 --> 32:43.769
Trying to score Brownie points.

32:46.989 --> 32:48.899
Not the brunette
in the little red number?

32:48.991 --> 32:50.071
Yep.

32:50.159 --> 32:53.077
She is absolutely
nothing like my den mother.

32:54.956 --> 32:56.865
You really should talk to my husband.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.583
I barely knew Petty Officer Curtin.

33:00.128 --> 33:01.688
We're actually more interested
in what you know

33:01.712 --> 33:04.120
about his wife, Margaret, Mrs Foley.

33:04.215 --> 33:05.484
According to her cell phone records,

33:05.508 --> 33:08.177
you two spoke regularly
after your husband's deployment.

33:08.261 --> 33:11.464
I kept in touch with all the wives.
It was a stressful time.

33:11.556 --> 33:15.221
Did Mrs Curtin ever talk about a man
that she might've become close to?

33:15.309 --> 33:17.468
- Maybe even started seeing?
- No.

33:17.562 --> 33:20.313
But Margie wouldn't confide in me
about something like that.

33:20.398 --> 33:21.809
What'd you talk about?

33:21.899 --> 33:25.149
Mostly about whether
we heard any news or talked to anyone.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.644
We were all desperate for information.

33:27.738 --> 33:30.146
Did Mrs Curtin seem any more
desperate than the rest of you?

33:30.241 --> 33:31.486
Or less?

33:31.576 --> 33:34.031
I really don't know.
I was a wreck myself.

33:34.537 --> 33:36.079
My husband got called to Washington

33:36.164 --> 33:38.655
immediately after the second plane
hit the Trade Centre.

33:38.749 --> 33:42.617
Said his team was being deployed.
He couldn't say where or for how long.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.412
They don't waste their time, do they?

33:45.506 --> 33:47.997
For the first six weeks,
we didn't hear so much as a word.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.844
After that,
we got occasional phone calls, e-mails.

33:50.928 --> 33:53.336
How long were they in Afghanistan?

33:53.514 --> 33:57.761
The lucky ones, almost six months.
One came back after the first week.

33:58.561 --> 34:00.241
Bill made it
through four and a half months

34:00.271 --> 34:01.516
before he got wounded.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.349
Wait. Your husband made it back

34:03.441 --> 34:05.730
almost a month
before Petty Officer Curtin?

34:06.402 --> 34:07.481
That's right.

34:09.864 --> 34:13.362
Abby, we have something linking
Curtin's wife to Commander Foley?

34:14.368 --> 34:16.574
As in, biblically linking?

34:16.661 --> 34:19.034
- You got it.
- No, I don't.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.286
Can you find it?

34:20.373 --> 34:22.367
Sorry, Gibbs,
I left my Ouija board at home.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.414
Is the magic in the board
or in the hands that hold it?

34:25.504 --> 34:26.536
Good point.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.456
But it's spirits, not magic.

34:28.549 --> 34:31.219
Fine. Have them call me
when you find something.

34:31.302 --> 34:34.469
Okay. Be careful what you wish for.

34:37.891 --> 34:39.303
Commander Foley?

34:40.853 --> 34:41.967
Yeah?

34:42.396 --> 34:43.855
We'll drive.

34:45.190 --> 34:49.402
E-L-I-S-A!

34:49.487 --> 34:51.063
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.112
- What you got?
- ELISA.

34:53.616 --> 34:58.325
See, I figure
how could I find evidence of an affair

34:58.412 --> 35:01.579
using only physical evidence
collected at a crime scene?

35:01.666 --> 35:04.157
And then I thought... ELISA.

35:04.919 --> 35:08.667
- It's a blood test for Herpes simplex 2.
- Curtin's wife had herpes?

35:09.590 --> 35:10.788
And her husband didn't.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.919
His medical records were admitted.

35:14.011 --> 35:16.134
Petty Officer Curtin
had an extensive physical done

35:16.222 --> 35:18.179
before he went overseas.
And I mean extensive.

35:18.266 --> 35:19.380
No herpes.

35:19.475 --> 35:21.411
Well, his wife could've gotten it
before they got married.

35:21.435 --> 35:22.515
Oh, the old,

35:22.603 --> 35:24.477
I-must've-gotten-it-before-we-met
defence.

35:24.563 --> 35:26.473
- Well, it can happen.
- Really?

35:27.650 --> 35:28.978
Well, not to me.

35:29.068 --> 35:30.693
No, it didn't.

35:30.778 --> 35:32.901
It hasn't happened. It won't happen.

35:32.989 --> 35:34.447
It didn't happen to her, either.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.774
Her medical records were admitted
during trial.

35:36.867 --> 35:39.193
Her last physical was
six months before she was murdered,

35:39.287 --> 35:40.911
when her husband was in Afghanistan:

35:40.997 --> 35:42.076
No herpes.

35:42.832 --> 35:45.749
All we need to do now
is check Commander Foley's records.

35:45.835 --> 35:47.911
Is there anything you can't find?

35:48.004 --> 35:49.996
A way to shut up DiNozzo.

35:54.802 --> 35:56.177
All right.

36:04.812 --> 36:07.220
You agree to waive
your Article 31 rights?

36:07.606 --> 36:08.935
I've got nothing to hide.

36:09.108 --> 36:10.899
I already told you,
I haven't heard from him.

36:10.985 --> 36:12.064
I don't expect to.

36:12.570 --> 36:16.105
Why not?
You testified on his behalf at the trial.

36:16.198 --> 36:18.736
Certainly seemed to be sympathetic
to his situation.

36:19.285 --> 36:20.530
Situation?

36:20.703 --> 36:24.403
Coming home and finding his wife
in the bedroom with another guy.

36:24.498 --> 36:25.957
Well, wouldn't that bother you?

36:26.042 --> 36:30.668
Oh, yeah, it bothered me a hell of a lot,
only I chose divorce over murder.

36:30.755 --> 36:32.249
- I didn't know that.
- He's lying.

36:32.340 --> 36:35.091
Establishing rapport
through shared communication.

36:35.176 --> 36:38.627
- Are you sure he's lying?
- Of course I'm... not.

36:38.721 --> 36:41.074
Of course, I was coming home
from a three month float in the Med,

36:41.098 --> 36:42.509
not six months in a war zone.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.920
Wouldn't make a difference to me.

36:45.519 --> 36:49.303
Actually, it was more like
four and a half months for you.

36:49.398 --> 36:52.150
- RPG broke your leg.
- I was lucky.

36:52.234 --> 36:53.978
Killed Petty Officer Gomez.

36:54.070 --> 36:55.101
You came home.

36:55.196 --> 36:57.354
Did you come home on crutches
or a walking cast?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.862
What does any of this have to do
with Petty Officer Curtin?

37:00.951 --> 37:02.066
It doesn't.

37:02.661 --> 37:03.990
It has to do with his wife

37:04.080 --> 37:06.535
and who really murdered her
and the cable repairman.

37:07.958 --> 37:09.501
You think I killed her?

37:10.669 --> 37:11.914
Did you?

37:12.838 --> 37:14.036
What's taking you so long?

37:14.131 --> 37:16.456
It's not like I can just Google
a Navy SEAL Commander

37:16.550 --> 37:18.271
and access
his confidential medical records.

37:18.594 --> 37:20.254
You think I'd frame a teammate?

37:20.679 --> 37:23.135
A guy who would put his life on the line
to save mine?

37:23.224 --> 37:24.599
Maybe you didn't mean to.

37:24.683 --> 37:27.221
If Curtin hadn't come home
exactly when he did,

37:27.311 --> 37:29.553
who knows what direction
this case might've gone in.

37:29.647 --> 37:33.479
Jack Curtin was one of the most
insanely jealous men I've ever met.

37:33.567 --> 37:37.186
- That's not what you said at his trial.
- I didn't wanna see him get executed.

37:39.407 --> 37:42.028
Sorry, could I see you a second, boss?

37:42.785 --> 37:44.943
Oh, I can't believe
I'm seeing what I'm seeing.

37:51.836 --> 37:55.335
Never interrupt an interrogation, McGee.

37:55.423 --> 37:56.502
Never.

37:56.590 --> 37:58.500
I'm sorry.

37:59.051 --> 38:00.843
I just thought...

38:00.928 --> 38:04.344
To have a thought, McGee,
you have to think.

38:04.432 --> 38:06.056
Were you thinking

38:06.559 --> 38:09.180
when you went
into the interrogation room?

38:09.270 --> 38:11.891
Yes, sir. I think so.

38:13.941 --> 38:16.017
Well, okay.

38:18.279 --> 38:20.318
What is so damn important?

38:38.549 --> 38:41.420
Margaret Curtin wasn't murdered
by her jealous husband.

38:42.344 --> 38:44.966
She was murdered by her jealous lover.

38:45.931 --> 38:47.723
The same one that gave her herpes.

38:50.478 --> 38:53.265
I'm not answering another question
until I talk to a lawyer.

38:56.192 --> 38:57.983
I want a lawyer, now.

38:59.069 --> 39:01.821
Hate to rain on your parade,
but we still don't have Curtin.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.982
At least he won't be able
to kill Commander Foley.

39:04.074 --> 39:06.363
Well, if we go public
that we found his wife's killer,

39:06.452 --> 39:08.263
there's a good chance
Curtin'll turn himself in,

39:08.287 --> 39:09.366
if he's still alive.

39:21.425 --> 39:22.919
It doesn't make any sense.

39:24.094 --> 39:26.170
- What?
- Nothing. It just

39:27.306 --> 39:30.473
- doesn't make any sense.
- You gonna give it up, DiNozzo?

39:31.143 --> 39:32.944
Or are you just gonna
keep repeating yourself?

39:32.978 --> 39:35.101
The calls from Curtin's wife
to the Foley house

39:35.189 --> 39:38.439
pretty much stopped
after Foley got back from Afghanistan.

39:38.526 --> 39:39.605
Yeah? So?

39:39.693 --> 39:41.004
So, if they were having an affair,

39:41.028 --> 39:43.780
wouldn't the calls increase
after he got back into town?

39:44.156 --> 39:45.877
Well, they didn't need to talk
on the phone.

39:45.908 --> 39:47.865
They could see each other in person.

39:47.952 --> 39:51.118
- Why did she stop talking to his wife?
- Well, maybe she couldn't.

39:51.205 --> 39:53.114
Would you be able to talk to the spouse

39:53.207 --> 39:54.867
of someone
you were having an affair with?

39:54.959 --> 39:58.078
- I mean, would a normal person?
- But she didn't completely stop.

39:58.170 --> 40:01.504
McGee, did Foley spend any time
in the hospital after he got back?

40:01.590 --> 40:05.374
Yeah, he had surgery on his leg,
and then again for a staph infection.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.794
Right. The surgery
was on November 13,

40:07.888 --> 40:11.138
back in for the infection on the 21st
for one, two, three days.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.469
Yeah, you're right.
How'd you know that?

40:13.561 --> 40:15.055
Because those are the only days.

40:15.145 --> 40:17.767
Curtin's wife made calls
to Foley's house after he got back.

40:19.733 --> 40:22.307
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

40:22.403 --> 40:23.565
I don't know, boss.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.528
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

40:26.574 --> 40:28.815
Yeah. Her lover wasn't Foley.

40:29.368 --> 40:30.648
It was his wife.

41:58.957 --> 42:00.749
I think you have something of mine.

42:01.877 --> 42:04.664
Put your hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

42:13.138 --> 42:16.554
Is this what you wanted your son
to remember you for?

42:22.940 --> 42:24.482
I'm not sure I'd even mind.

42:24.566 --> 42:26.559
You wouldn't mind
if your wife had an affair?

42:26.652 --> 42:29.024
With another babe? I don't think I would.

42:29.113 --> 42:31.568
Okay, I know I'm gonna regret this,
but, why?

42:31.657 --> 42:34.409
Easy. With a guy,
I'd think, "What's he got that I don't?"

42:34.493 --> 42:35.821
But if it was a woman, I'd know.

42:35.911 --> 42:38.319
- Plus, there's the whole, you know.
- What?

42:38.414 --> 42:41.331
- When the women, you know...
- Oh, please.

42:41.417 --> 42:43.742
Why are guys so interested in women

42:43.836 --> 42:46.327
who, by definition,
have no interest in them?

42:46.839 --> 42:48.084
There's no such thing.

42:48.716 --> 42:51.156
- There's no such thing as lesbians?
- That's not what I said.

42:51.218 --> 42:53.887
Oh, you just think
all lesbians secretly still want a man?

42:53.971 --> 42:55.928
- Not all of them.
- Just the good-looking ones?

42:56.014 --> 42:57.425
You're putting words in my mouth.

42:57.891 --> 42:59.931
Welcome to the wonderful world
of DiNozzo.

43:00.018 --> 43:03.103
So I guess you're completely
above such fantasies?

43:03.188 --> 43:04.433
Yeah, I am.

43:04.690 --> 43:06.065
Believe it.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.615
Who's that?

43:16.702 --> 43:18.576
That's a good question. Ask him.

43:19.705 --> 43:21.496
Just dropping off my glasses.

43:24.168 --> 43:25.282
Boss?

43:26.795 --> 43:27.826
Yeah, McGee?

43:27.921 --> 43:30.459
It was really nice
working with you again.

43:31.633 --> 43:32.796
Same here, McGee.

43:34.887 --> 43:35.966
By the way,

43:36.054 --> 43:39.139
there's something that Tony and Kate
have been meaning to ask you.
