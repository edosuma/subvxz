[hospital equipment beeping,
distant sirens]

00:11.920 --> 00:14.320
[woman] Best case scenario,
if the baby survived,

00:14.400 --> 00:16.720
-and that's a big 'if'...
[Audrey] Fuck.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.720
[woman] ...we'd be dealing with
a pretty severe head injury.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.760
-Shit.
[woman] You're incredibly lucky, you know.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.840
Hi. Are you...
Are you OK? What happened?

00:23.920 --> 00:26.400
-Pine cone.
-What?

00:27.440 --> 00:30.120
A pine cone fell from a tree onto my head.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.160
-It was a really big one.
-OK.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.080
-Don't laugh. It really hurt. It did.
-[chuckling] I'm not laughing.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.400
I'm relieved.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.840
You texted me 'HEAD INJURY AT EMERGENCY'
in caps.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.120
Five stitches there.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.440
OK, but can we just agree
to use lower case

00:45.520 --> 00:46.760
unless there's a real emergency?

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
It could have been Stevie.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.560
Well, thank God it wasn't.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.760
Don't you think it's a sign?

00:51.840 --> 00:52.960
A sign of what?

00:53.040 --> 00:55.400
Well, a projectile
literally falling from sky.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.440
Oh, wow. We're not doing this.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.320
It was a pine cone.
I think that's a sign that spring is done.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.040
-We're atheists, remember?
-Yeah, you are.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.360
I'm a lapsed Catholic, leaning agnostic.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.520
Since when?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.480
We're not baptising Stevie

01:09.560 --> 01:11.480
because you made a promise to God
in the heat of the moment.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.560
That's their modus operandi,
preying on the weak.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.200
Let me see.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.280
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're really neat.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.760
Look, even if you don't believe,

01:19.840 --> 01:21.560
-does it really matter if I do or not?
-Yes.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.320
-The church is just around the corner.
-I don't care.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.600
-I really want to--
[doctor] How's the patient?

01:25.680 --> 01:27.680
-Have you checked him for brain damage?
-Very nice.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.760
Of course. We check for brain damage
with every head injury.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.600
Sorry, I was just kidding.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.880
We don't kid about brain damage.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.400
OK. Sorry. You two are fun.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.120
[electronic music]

01:47.120 --> 01:49.520
[whispering indistinctly]

01:49.600 --> 01:50.800
[Belle] Here she is.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.120
Thank you.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.480
[Ester] Half day?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.920
-What? It's 9:05.
-Oh, no, I'm joking. [laughs]

01:59.000 --> 02:00.560
Oh, god. [laughs]

02:00.640 --> 02:03.040
But we all do manage to get here
before 8:00.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.680
Sure, that should be fine next week.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.840
Sorry, I just had to drop Stevie at Barb's
because I couldn't get--

02:06.920 --> 02:08.479
Hold on. Shh. Hold on.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.280
Sorry, hang on.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.400
Sorry.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.240
-Hi.
-Hi!

02:13.320 --> 02:16.560
So, you wrote the Lord Mayor's
speeches?

02:16.640 --> 02:18.640
Ah, not exactly.
They use my copy sometimes--

02:18.720 --> 02:23.000
I am speaking at an international
conference on retirement savings,

02:23.080 --> 02:26.760
discussing SMSFs
and how we can close the gender gap...

02:26.840 --> 02:29.440
[speech fades] ...and give women
more financial integrity,

02:29.520 --> 02:33.240
but any time that I mention the phrase
'gender gap', people just tune out.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.120
Gee, that's appalling.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.920
And so I need you to draft something
really punchy and engaging.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.480
Got it. Easy-peasy.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.400
Oh, did you want a coffee first?

02:42.480 --> 02:43.720
Yes, please. I haven't had one.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.680
Great. Can you get me one too?
I want a skinny latte.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.080
But don't go to that place downstairs,
'cause they spell 'espresso' with an X.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.840
And then you can just crack on
with the speech.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.160
Will do. Great.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.320
[whispers] Excuse me, what's an SMSF?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.520
-Self managed super fund.
-Fund! That... -It's what we do here.
-Yeah, thought so. Thank you.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.560
Sorry, I got a bit close then.
Back in a sec.

[Miss Jo] Hands in laps. Thank you.

-Sorry.
-Morning, Jake. Morning, Jess.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.720
Come and find your spot on the rug.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.200
Now, today is...

03:48.280 --> 03:50.440
[all] Monday.
[boy] Friday.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.880
[Miss Jo] No, it's Thursday.
It's Thursday.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.920
Because yesterday was...

03:56.000 --> 03:57.640
[children] Wednesday.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.360
[Miss Jo] And tomorrow is...
[children] Friday.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.320
[Miss Jo] OK. Now, let's all get ready
for our morning visitors.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.000
First up, we have Ollie's mum, Karen.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.920
Hi, Miss Jo. Hi.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.080
Sorry, what's going on?
Why is Karen in dress-ups?

04:13.160 --> 04:15.000
They're operating scrubs.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.320
Oh, careers day.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.920
How did I miss that email?
I'm room parent!

04:20.000 --> 04:21.600
It didn't go to everyone.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.120
Oh, hi, Ray's dad!

04:25.200 --> 04:28.400
OK. It's Josh. Hi.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.560
Hi, Josh.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.160
OK, well, have fun, career people.
[chuckles]

04:34.240 --> 04:35.440
OK, bye.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.520
OK. You two behave.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.080
[Miss Jo] OK, well,
who here knows what a doctor does?

04:41.160 --> 04:42.440
Let's go to the park.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.360
[child] Fixes people.
[Miss Jo] Fixes people!

04:44.440 --> 04:48.200
[solemn piano music]

04:58.200 --> 05:01.040
So we retire with half the cash?
Well, that's brilliant.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.560
Well, a little more than half, but yeah.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.400
Jesus, women are screwed.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.880
And no-one does anything about it!

05:07.160 --> 05:09.360
Apart from you, obviously. Thank you.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.440
Right. But what with the wage disparity,
we have got a long way to go.

05:12.520 --> 05:17.800
Well, from now on, I am coming to you
for all of my retirement stuff.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.240
What fund are you in?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.240
Uh, I've actually got
a few different funds.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.640
-I should probably consolidate.
-Yep, do that.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.720
-Yeah, but all the forms, and the...
-Yeah. One form.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.040
-Just one, is it?
-Yep.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.440
I will.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.080
Um, but this speech will write itself,

05:34.160 --> 05:35.800
because everyone loves a story
of oppression.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.280
Great. Just make sure it sounds like me,
sharp and direct.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.200
Nothing cutesy, no wordplay
or silly puns. I hate that shit.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.320
I know what you copywriters are like.
Just make it good.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.640
OK, let's have fun with the funds.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.680
[Ester] Not that.
-OK, no.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.880
Today we will learn
how to save a child's life.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.440
Is this it?

06:04.520 --> 06:06.080
Um, yep. Mm-hm.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.400
Well, it's hardly worth it.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.600
Psst.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.880
Psst. Belle.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.720
Belle? Sorry, Belle?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.480
-Belle?
-Yeah?

06:38.560 --> 06:41.240
Um, the princess syndrome is?

06:41.320 --> 06:43.800
Relying on a man to take
financial care of you.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.280
That makes sense, right.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.520
OK, uh...

06:51.800 --> 06:53.000
Belle?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.960
Sorry, Belle?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.880
Belle? Belle?

06:57.720 --> 06:58.720
Belle?

06:59.600 --> 07:02.120
Belle? Belle?

07:04.840 --> 07:06.960
[phone rings]

07:07.040 --> 07:08.520
Hello, Belle speaking.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.640
Ah, Belle, it's Audrey.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.400
[all counting softly]

07:16.160 --> 07:17.240

Organ collapse.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.200
You're hitting the intestines,
not the heart.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.160
Two fingers, not the whole hand.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.240
Oh, OK. I'm sorry.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.640
Don't apologise to me.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.400
Dead.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.920
OK, whatever.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.720
OK, yours is fighting for its life.
What's the acronym?

07:37.800 --> 07:41.160
Um, OK, it is DS... D... Doctor...

07:41.240 --> 07:42.720
-Come on!
-DSR...

07:42.800 --> 07:44.520
-A!
-Come on! Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.200
Sorry, can you just stop yelling at me
for a second?

07:46.280 --> 07:47.680
Come on. Come on!
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.080
DRSABCD!

07:49.160 --> 07:51.080
Yes, DRS. S.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.800
'S' for 'send for help'. Didn't happen.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.880
No paramedic is coming to help that bub.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.280
Now it's dead.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.440
No, no, no, it's still breathing.
Three, four. Ah, ah...

08:00.520 --> 08:02.640
-It is not breathing.
-...staying alive. It is still breathing.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.200
-Three, four--
-It's not breathing. It's dead.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.000
No. [sighs]

08:09.080 --> 08:10.640
[camera shutter noise]

08:10.720 --> 08:11.720
What are you doing?

08:12.640 --> 08:15.520
Oh, sorry, won't take a sec,
I've just got to post this.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.440
No, it's inappropriate,
and plus, they're really expensive.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.600
Put it down.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.880
Right, one more time.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.520
OK. Thank you, Dr Karen.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.240
I actually did get the email.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.240
Hey, aren't I next?
I've really got to get back.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.440
Calm down, it's raining outside.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.320
Oh, OK, well, it looks like Barbara
is here, and she's...

08:36.400 --> 08:37.880
-Hold that.
-What?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.960
[upbeat military march plays]
So excited to be here. Hi, everyone!

08:42.120 --> 08:45.880
Who knows what a SAHM is? Anyone?

08:45.960 --> 08:48.240
[children] No.
[Barbara] Anyone? No? Miss Jo?

08:48.320 --> 08:51.000
Doctor? Didn't learn that at uni.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.840
It is a stay-at-home mum.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.080
With super powers and a cape.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.520
OK, cut the... cut the music. Cut it.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.080
[music stops]
Yeah. Yeah, cool.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.120
OK, so, I have extraordinary
superpowers.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.840
Who wants to hear what they are?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.040
[all] Me, me, me, me, me.
-Yeah, OK, alright, ready?

09:12.120 --> 09:14.640
Number one, super speed.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.000
Who knows where a super mum
might go shopping?

09:17.080 --> 09:20.760
-Target.
-No, a supermarket.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.600
You should see me whip around that
supermarket faster than the speed of light

09:24.680 --> 09:26.440
and I'm telling you,
no-one can keep up with me.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.280
Especially Jakey, he always ends up
in the lost and found.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.640
[laughter]

09:30.720 --> 09:33.480
Number two, I can make things disappear,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.880
like, good things, like cake and wine,

09:35.960 --> 09:39.960
but also bad things, like sore tummies
or nightmares or splinters.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.200
I can totally get a splinter out
in ten seconds or less.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.280
No tears, no tweezers, guaranteed.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.280
Number three, excellent communication.

09:48.360 --> 09:52.360
I can understand people
who can't even speak.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.040
Oh, and I can totally produce my own milk.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.160
Because I'm a SAHM.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.120
[all cheering]

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
[Ester] It's mostly grammatical.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.320
-Oh, really?
-Really.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.400
Hey, how many licence points
do you have?

10:10.480 --> 10:12.040
Not sure. Why?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.640
Just wondering if you could sign this.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.960
"I declare that I was driving the vehicle
on the afternoon of the twenty..."

10:19.040 --> 10:21.640
Hang on. So, what, I'm...

10:21.720 --> 10:23.280
I'm supposed to have been
driving your car?

10:23.360 --> 10:26.360
I'll pay, obviously,
I just need some of your points.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.200
-Can't Ruben?
-Oh, no. No, he can't.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.480
I mean, it's not a big deal.
Belle's given me four points.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.440
-Six.
-Six points. Thank you, Belle.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.520
Can I check how many points I have left?

10:38.480 --> 10:41.000
Um, if you need to.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.440
[Belle] You should check.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.720
OK.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.440
[alarm gently beeps]
Oh, uh...

10:48.520 --> 10:51.320
Um... where can I express?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.200
-Express what?
-Milk.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.800
-Oh.
-Yeah.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.000
[Belle] You can't do it here?

10:57.080 --> 11:00.560
She can't do it here, Belle!
Out in the open.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.360
Unless you want to do it here.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.680
[child] What do you actually do?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.280
Um, heaps.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.400
Who do you go to if you fall off your bike
and you're bleeding?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.400
The doctor?

11:13.080 --> 11:14.720
No, mate, waste of time and money,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.240
not unless she bulk bills,
but then she'll still keep you waiting.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.440
It's me.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.760
And what about,

11:19.840 --> 11:23.200
who looks after your sheets
if you've done a little bit of a wee?

11:23.280 --> 11:25.120
[all laugh]
-The cleaner.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.040
Ah. I wish. Me!

11:28.120 --> 11:30.320
And what about if you need to
sort out your finances?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.640
The bank?

11:31.720 --> 11:35.240
-No, it's me again!
[all giggle]

11:35.320 --> 11:36.680
Do you know Santa?

11:36.760 --> 11:38.360
-Yeah.
[all gasp]

11:38.440 --> 11:40.280
And the Easter bunny
follows me on Instagram.

11:40.360 --> 11:45.560
Oh, and sometimes I Snapchat with
the tooth fairy, and she is hilarious.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.000
You guys would love her.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.520
[phone ringing]

11:52.960 --> 11:56.160
<i>Hi, this is Barb. Leave a message. Thanks.</i>

11:56.240 --> 11:58.440
Uh...
[pump whirring loudly]

11:58.520 --> 12:02.800
Hi, Barb. It's just Audrey again,
just checking in about Stevie.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.080
So if you could give me a call back
or just text me, that would be great.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
OK, thanks.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.760
Oh, shit. [gasps] Oh, my god.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.880
[Barbara] But the most important part
about my job

12:13.960 --> 12:16.840
is making sure that my employees,
you guys,

12:16.920 --> 12:18.360
are happy and healthy, yeah,

12:18.440 --> 12:21.560
and you grow up to be the best
superheroes you can be.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.800
Ha-ha! So, any questions?

12:25.680 --> 12:27.960
My rabbit died.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.280
OK, I'll take that as a comment.
Any questions? Go.

12:31.360 --> 12:35.240
What do you like best about your job?

12:35.320 --> 12:38.960
Ooh, tough one. Top three -

12:39.040 --> 12:42.360
I can wear a flat shoe,
I like most of my employees,

12:42.440 --> 12:44.400
and, oh, and I can never get fired.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.760
But I can also never quit,
so, you know, pros and cons.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.480
Next. Yeah.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.080
How much do you get paid?

12:52.160 --> 12:53.560
[chuckles] Don't ask.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.840
Heaps. I get paid in hug currency.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.680
I'm actually a billionaire.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.680
When I grow up, I'm going to be
a stay-at-home mum.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.240
-Me too.
-Yeah! SAHM! Whoo-hoo.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.840
[children cheering]

13:11.200 --> 13:12.600
Alright. They're all yours.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.440
Come on, give me some skin.
Give me some skin.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.240
Thanks, Miss Jo. Whoo-hoo. See ya.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.760
Um. Hi. So, I'm a firefighter...

13:21.840 --> 13:24.320
Fuck, I can't cancel it.
I'll just have to...

13:24.400 --> 13:26.480
Well, we'll move the other thing.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.200
Sorry, that took a while.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.880
Wow, you're like some kind of dairy cow.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.640
I just dropped my phone in the loo
when I was trying to call Barb.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.200
Does anyone have any hand sanitiser?

13:35.280 --> 13:36.280
Give it here.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.080
Rice.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.880
Multi-tasking is a bitch.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.080
But the good news is it does get easier.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.560
You'll get on top of it.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.360
And I will find Barb's phone number
for you.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.640
Oh, thank you.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.600
I just need to ask you a little favour.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.080
Uh, is it legal?

13:53.160 --> 13:54.600
Well, it depends.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.000
I'm just wondering if
you can meet Ruben

13:57.080 --> 13:58.520
at the Santa Sabina Church
on the corner--

13:58.600 --> 14:01.480
Oh, I know that. It's right near my house.
I love that place. Sorry, why?

14:04.880 --> 14:07.240
I haven't seen you two at mass.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.520
No... I've been here!
We've... We've been here.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.480
-Um, a few weeks back.
-Yeah.

14:15.560 --> 14:21.560
When you gave that beautiful speech
about the LGBT... QI...

14:21.640 --> 14:22.840
-A.
-A.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.400
-Don't forget the A.
-Of course. [chuckles] The asexuals.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.960
-Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
-I did. Yeah.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.320
So, you're after an endorsement letter.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.880
-Yes.
[Ruben] Yeah.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.480
Yeah, we'd love Eva to, um...
to go to...

14:36.560 --> 14:38.480
Santa Sabina. Yeah.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.760
Because we really think
it's important that she...

14:41.840 --> 14:45.080
Attend an affordable girls' school
with a good academic record?

14:47.760 --> 14:50.480
I'm guessing you know that Santa Sabina
was ranked the number-one girls' school

14:50.560 --> 14:52.200
in the state last year?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.680
Yeah, we did hear about that.
Didn't we, darling?

14:54.760 --> 14:57.240
We did. And that's remarkable, Father.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.480
Thank you.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.680
But, you know, it's the pastoral care,
really, that excites us.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.240
-Doesn't it?
-That's right. Yep.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.760
Right, then, just a few questions.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.080
Ester, do you like your Bible?

15:14.880 --> 15:17.720
Do I? Yes, I do. [laughs]

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
Favourite gospel?

15:20.320 --> 15:25.400
Oh, that is... that's a tough one,
Father.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.960
You always say Matthew, though.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.080
I do. I do say Matthew.

15:30.280 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, I think, yeah,
probably still Matthew.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.080
Yeah.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.920
Um... because Matthew...

15:37.600 --> 15:39.800
What's the word? He really...

15:39.880 --> 15:43.320
-Humanises the Jesus story.
-That's what he does. He does.
And, well, it just grounds it for me.

15:46.920 --> 15:51.120
Whereas I'm more of a John man.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.000
I really like the, uh,
the symbols in his gospel.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.800
Sure does. Always going on about
John and the symbols.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.000
[laughs] Typical male.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.880
Ester, what do you mean?

16:06.280 --> 16:12.960
Oh, that's just a sweeping generalisation
about symbols... and men.

16:14.320 --> 16:18.320
You know how men and symbols,
traditionally they're...

16:18.400 --> 16:21.080
Although, look, that's not even true
because I was very good at algebra.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.000
I like symbols as well.

16:23.920 --> 16:28.200
And he is not a typical male in any way.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.560
He is a primary carer.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.120
He is a very devoted father
and a beautiful father.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.720
Look, at him. [chuckles]

16:33.800 --> 16:35.040
Amazing at it.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.680
That's all I meant.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.880
Favourite Biblical figure?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.440
[Ruben] Well, for me...

16:43.520 --> 16:46.400
Ah... Ester?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.480
I like...

16:50.920 --> 16:54.040
I like the singers in the Bible.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.520
I like...
See, I like all the religious songs.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.480
-Hymns.
-Hymns. I love all the religious hymns.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.920
But that wasn't the question.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.319
Um, if I had to choose one figure,
I would say...

17:08.880 --> 17:10.000
Noah.

17:11.358 --> 17:12.720
Noah?

17:12.800 --> 17:16.118
I really like... um, I love water.
I mean, I'm a bit of a swimmer.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.240
But I love the rain and animals.

17:21.319 --> 17:25.040
Wasn't a big fan of the Russell Crowe
movie, though.

17:25.118 --> 17:28.760
That was woeful.
But it is a great story, isn't it?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.520
Apocalyptic, and, I mean,
he's a real hero figure.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.760
Saving the animals.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.680
I think that's a worthy thing to do.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.240
Yeah, yeah.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.760
Well, I'll be happy to write you
the school endorsement letter.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.840
-Oh, really? Oh, thank you.
-That's fantastic. [chuckles]

17:48.920 --> 17:53.280
-Thank you.
-Yeah, so do we just wait here or outside?

17:53.360 --> 17:56.920
Well, I could do it for you now...
or I'll see you Sunday.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.040
-Yeah.
-[stammering indistinctly]

18:02.120 --> 18:05.200
Sunday is fine.
We'll see you here anyway.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.360
Sunday.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.480
What a good devoted Catholic couple.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.080
You'd be surprised how many parents
come in here just after that letter.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.120
-Never come to mass.
[both] Really?

18:14.200 --> 18:16.040
-Oh, well, that's shocking.
-Mmm.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.400
-Just deplorable.
[both chuckle]

18:18.480 --> 18:21.040
-I can imagine, actually, some people.
-Yeah.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.440
I am so... I'm so sorry. I just,
when I'm nervous I just can't stop.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.840
Oh, no, thank God you did.
I just froze. Just left you out to dry.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.720
I went straight back to St Joseph's.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.640
Oh, god, I'm still shaking.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.520
-I'm sorry I mentioned <i> The Book of Mormon.</i>
-Oh, no.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.600
I meant to say <i> Jesus Christ Superstar,</i>
obviously. Which I love.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.400
-No, I don't think he noticed.
-Oh, man. Really?

18:43.480 --> 18:45.680
Yeah. I wouldn't have picked you
for a musical girl.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.760
Huh?

18:46.840 --> 18:49.160
No, I mean, that's a massive compliment,
by the way.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.280
-Huge. The biggest fan.
-Me too.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.480
-Really? What?
-Yeah.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.800
-Jeremy hates them.
-So does Ester.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.160
-What's your favourite?
<i>-Les Mis.</i>

18:56.240 --> 18:58.520
-Yes, yes, it is.
[both laugh] How about Hugh Jackman in the movie?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.680
-Oh, yes, the confrontation.
-Oh, my god! Yes.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.320
I do a pretty good Valjean, actually.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.480
And I, Javert.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.440
[man's voice loudly reads pop-up]

19:20.520 --> 19:24.000
Shut up, shut up, shut up...

19:26.280 --> 19:28.400
[volume increases then decreases]
Sorry, guys. Just...

19:28.480 --> 19:31.600
[man's voice] <i> ...and he'll destroy you</i>
<i>off the face of the earth.</i>

19:31.680 --> 19:32.880
[silence]
What is that?

19:32.960 --> 19:36.680
Uh... are your ad pop-up algorithms
all weird today?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.440
-Nup, no.
-Really? Mine are just... cuckoo.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.560
[both singing]
[Audrey laughing]

19:44.960 --> 19:46.440
Oh, my god.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.720
I think I just had a mini stroke.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.520
That was... [laughs]

19:50.600 --> 19:52.080
You can get up there.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.280
-You have a really good baritone.
-Thank you.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.480
-Yeah. Wow.
-That was... That was good.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.120
-Whoo.
-Yes.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.280
[laughing] Oh, my god. Thanks for that.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.120
Yeah. Anytime.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.200
[laughs]

20:08.320 --> 20:09.600
Well, I should probably...

20:09.680 --> 20:11.560
There's my car,
so I should probably go back to work.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.760
-How's it going with Ester?
-Ah, it's fun.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.000
-Oh, good.
-Yeah, she's a real dynamo, isn't she?

20:17.080 --> 20:19.880
Yes, she is.
I told her to be on her best behaviour.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.400
-Did you?
-Yeah.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.760
Are you missing Stevie?

20:23.520 --> 20:25.520
Well, my boobs are. Jeez.

20:25.600 --> 20:30.800
Um, but if... you know, would you think
I was a terrible mother if I said no?

20:31.880 --> 20:36.320
Nup. And I happen to think you're an
excellent mother for that very reason.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.520
Because you're honest.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.480
I mean, you did just lie to a priest.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.040
-I did.
-But yes, apart from that.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.720
We both did.
And we will do it again Sunday.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.240
Ah, yes.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.720
Actually, you know what, don't worry
about Sunday. I'll do that myself.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.160
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.200
OK.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.080
Well, I'll... I'll go.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.920
Yeah. Thank you so much.
It was just... You were perfect.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.720
You are perfect. I mean, thank you.
See you later, wifey.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.000
-[laughs] OK. Bye, husband.
-Bye.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.080
-Bye.
-See you later.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.200
[both] Oop.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.120
Uh...

21:11.920 --> 21:13.920
-I'm so sorry about that.
-OK. That...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.200
-No, that's... [chuckles]
-My tongue just...

21:16.280 --> 21:18.520
No, that's fine. That's fine. Um...

21:18.600 --> 21:19.760
Bye, Eva.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.720
-Um, OK.
-Thank you. I'm sorry.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.200
No, no, no. OK, see ya.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.480
I was just... OK, that happened.
That's OK.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.960
[Ester] I know. Yep.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.720
[phone rings]

21:43.960 --> 21:46.240
[Ester] Let me deal with it.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.440
I won't be a moment.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.280
[whispers] Audrey, can you come in here?

21:53.360 --> 21:55.240
Just say that you have lost
the spreadsheet.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.280
Just go with me. Just say,
"I have lost the spreadsheet."

21:58.360 --> 22:00.040
OK, sure. That's fine.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.000
-Sorry. Just...
-No, that's fine.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.160
-Can you close the door, please?
-Yep.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.000
Do you want to explain to Jan

22:10.080 --> 22:12.000
what happened to her
investment options spreadsheet

22:12.080 --> 22:13.800
that she was expecting last week?

22:16.880 --> 22:19.000
I... lost it.

22:19.080 --> 22:23.080
Lost it? How do you lose a spreadsheet?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.640
Well... Um...

22:31.920 --> 22:34.800
-Um...
-Use your words, Audrey.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.360
Your mistake has cost
our most valued client significantly.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.080
There will be serious repercussions.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.040
I think that you owe Jan an apology.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.320
OK. Sorry, Jan.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.760
Oh, please. A proper apology.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.600
-I'm very sorry, Jan.
[Ester] Thank you.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.400
-You can go.
-Thank you.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.360
[Ester] Amateur, absolute amateur.
She's on her final warning.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.320
I'm so sorry.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.560
Great, well, let's get this fixed.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.520
Yes, well, that's my point exactly,
but no, no, it was no trouble at all,

23:14.600 --> 23:17.520
and thank you for fitting it in
before your flight.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.360
Bye, now.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.000
-[whispers] I am so sorry.
-It's OK.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.800
Sorry, Belle, can you just
make sure she gets the taxi.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.640
Sorry.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.280
So how did you and Ruben go?
Did you get away with your little ruse?

23:31.360 --> 23:33.360
[chuckles] Yeah, I think so.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.040
So you got the endorsement letter.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.760
-Well, no.
-What?

23:36.840 --> 23:40.480
I mean, yes. We will. Just on Sunday.

23:40.560 --> 23:44.800
Father kind of tricked us into that.
He's very crafty.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.280
So are you free to go on Sunday?
Oh, god, that's not going to work, is it?

23:47.360 --> 23:50.600
No, because it has to be you.
And besides, I'm Jewish.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.240
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.560
We just wanted to have a bet both ways,
you know,

23:54.640 --> 23:56.800
in case we were wrong,
which I doubt we are.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.240
But you're free Sunday?

23:58.920 --> 24:01.920
Yeah, I can be free on Sunday.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.480
And do bring me all your super stuff.
I will consolidate it for you.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.120
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.960
Oh, and, uh...
did you check your licence points?

24:12.040 --> 24:13.560
Yes, they're all yours.
How many do you need?

24:13.640 --> 24:15.200
-Four.
-Oh.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.400
Shit.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
[knocking on door]

24:18.480 --> 24:21.080
[Barbara] Who's that? Who's that?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.720
That's... Mummy!

24:24.800 --> 24:26.880
-Hi!
-Hey, love.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.840
Oh, I am sorry I'm so late.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.600
I was the first to leave,
if you can believe it.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.920
Oh, no, she is a dream.
It's almost not fair.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.120
Oh, yeah, sorry about the permanent
marker on her little cardie there.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.920
I don't think it is perm... I think they
just say it's permanent on the packet,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.640
yeah, I got it off her face mostly.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.280
Thank you. It's OK. Thank you, Barb.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.200
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, you're welcome. Bye, love. Bye.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.520
Oh, I missed you, my darling. [kisses]

24:51.480 --> 24:56.400
And so, what, at present,
is the reward for a lifetime of caring?

24:56.480 --> 24:58.560
Seeing out your retirement in poverty?

24:58.640 --> 25:02.640
This needs to change, it has to change,
and it can.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.440
Christ, she thinks she's Aaron Sorkin.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.400
I'll have to cut out
all that sentimental rubbish.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.520
It's really good, Est.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.080
It's not that good. It's a bit wordy.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.160
Too many puns. Typical copywriter.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.160
-Hey, Est?
-Yeah?

25:20.840 --> 25:23.320
I'm wondering if we should
go back to couples.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.480
Therapy? Why?

25:31.120 --> 25:32.920
I just... I think I miss it.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.120
Just... Do you?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.520
I mean, it'd be nice to see Brad again.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.360
I mean, unless you don't want to.
If you don't want to...

25:40.440 --> 25:42.680
-There's nothing wrong.
-You want to go?

25:42.760 --> 25:44.480
Not if you don't want to, but...

25:44.560 --> 25:45.960
[phone ringing]

25:48.240 --> 25:50.200
Oh, hey, Audrey.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.480
Yep.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.520
Yeah, I'm just going to send through
some corrections on the speech, OK?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.960
What?

26:05.360 --> 26:07.280
-What? What's she saying?
-Yeah.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.840
OK.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.240
Yeah.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.040
What is it? What is it?

26:20.800 --> 26:23.800
It was very brief.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.080
Audrey's quit.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.160
[relieved sigh]

26:30.200 --> 26:32.760
[annoyed sigh] Unreliable.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.120
[Ester] Totally.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.680
-That was so fast. So unprofessional.
-Unprofessional.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.960
Shoosh, you kids. I'm on the phone.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.160
[Miss Jo] <i> Hi, Barb.</i>
-Hello?

26:44.240 --> 26:47.120
<i>-Oh, it's Miss Jo.</i>
-Oh, g'day, Miss Jo. What have they done?

26:47.200 --> 26:49.520
<i>No, nothing. I'm calling because...</i>

26:49.600 --> 26:51.720
<i>Well, you know Margaret, our teachers aid,</i>

26:51.800 --> 26:55.200
<i>she is retiring in two months,</i>
<i>and we haven't found a replacement yet.</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:58.200
<i>And you clearly have a great rapport</i>
<i>with the kids.</i>

26:58.280 --> 27:02.560
<i>I don't suppose you'd be interested in</i>
<i>working in the classroom two days a week?</i>

27:02.640 --> 27:05.600
-Like, with my kids and all the kids?
<i>-Yes.</i>

27:05.680 --> 27:07.960
[gentle piano music]

27:09.400 --> 27:11.600
Nah. Wouldn't have thought so, love.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.080
<i>-Oh.</i>
-Definitely not. It's a hard no.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.840
<i>-OK.</i>
-OK. OK, then. Bye-bye.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.320
<i>-Bye.</i>
-No.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.600
[Ruben] Yes, yes, we've heard
the music program is excellent,

27:22.680 --> 27:25.360
which we're very excited about.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.280
-Ester, good morning.
-Morning, sir. Father.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.240
-Happy to lend my support.
-Oh, terrific.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.560
See you inside.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.160
-Thank you. Yes. See you in there.
-You will. Thanks.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.560
Thank you so much for doing this.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.320
-It's fine.
-Let's just...

27:42.000 --> 27:43.600
-OK.
[Pete] Audrey.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.800
Hi. Audrey.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.120
No, Ester.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.800
Ester? Audrey.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.560
Ester, where are you going?

27:54.640 --> 27:55.920
What is going on?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.720
Nothing. What are you doing?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.640
Nothing. Are you about to...

28:01.440 --> 28:03.280
Fucking hell, Jeremy.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.560
Hey, just... just calm down.
Sorry, Father. No, I will not calm down until you tell me

28:07.920 --> 28:10.720
you were not seriously about to
baptise our child without my consent.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.960
[priest stammers]
-Jesus Christ. Is that even legal?

28:14.040 --> 28:15.680
Technically, one parent can baptise,

28:15.760 --> 28:18.000
but whose child... is that...

28:18.080 --> 28:19.240
How many babies you got?

28:19.320 --> 28:20.840
[Ruben] Maybe we should do this
somewhere else.

28:20.920 --> 28:24.280
Look, Aud, it's just one little sacrament,
alright? It's just one.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.680
I don't want to do the other six,
although I do want to get married one day.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.960
I'm terrified something is going to
happen to her or to you.

28:30.040 --> 28:33.200
Because of a promise you made
to a god you don't even believe in?

28:33.280 --> 28:35.280
I never said I don't believe in...

28:35.360 --> 28:38.960
Oh, Father, that's Mary firing up
the organ. We should head in to...

28:39.640 --> 28:40.800
And why is he here?

28:40.880 --> 28:42.200
Godparent.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.560
That's your pick?

28:43.640 --> 28:46.120
He is a misanthrope who hates children,

28:46.200 --> 28:48.560
and I happen to know he's taken
the Scientology test twice.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.640
[Pete] Once with you.
-Are you even Catholic?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.240
Yes, Church of England, which,
until Henry VIII, was Catholic.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.560
-Right, Father?
-No.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.640
[Pete] I dispute that.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.520
Is anyone here
an actual practising Catholic?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.720
Besides him, obviously.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.360
-Ester, Ester, let's go. Let's go.
[priest] Just, please!

29:09.080 --> 29:10.360
[Ruben] Oh, no.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.200
So close.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.760
Father, could we talk? Could we just...

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
I don't know what that was...

29:17.920 --> 29:20.280
Give her to me. Give her to me.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.160
And what are you doing here?

29:22.240 --> 29:24.520
You were on a nice little church date
with your mate Ruben.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.040
Do you want to tell me a bit about that?

29:31.880 --> 29:32.960
Aud. Audrey.
