00:05.680 --> 00:08.200
Ah, the annual nurses' convention.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.280
You know, according to
my bathroom reading...

00:10.360 --> 00:13.920
all nurses are actually
horny for high school boys.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.200
Why do you think
those hospital gowns have no backs?

00:18.240 --> 00:20.280
So the nurses can
check out your ass.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.520
Look at this sexy stampede.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.520
It's like <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:31.440
I will stalk their
sexy herd like a lion.

00:31.520 --> 00:35.440
I cannot run as fast, but let's see a lion
put on this much cologne.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.480
Oh, look, Red!

00:40.560 --> 00:44.680
All of my colleagues gathered
together to talk about health and medicine.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.640
And to drink until their livers
turn into cocktail onions.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.680
- Red, it is not that bad.
- Yeah?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.680
What about last year when you and
your buddies took the bellboy's pants?

00:54.760 --> 00:56.360
Well, they were all wet.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.480
Because you threw him in the pool!

00:59.560 --> 01:01.440
- Oh, hey, Roy.
- Hi, guys.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.480
Oh, st-stay away from
this batch of egg rolls.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.720
- They were on the floor.
- Oh, you dropped 'em?

01:05.760 --> 01:08.280
No, I was lying down.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.200
You know, if I were God,
this is what heaven would be like-

01:11.280 --> 01:13.600
pretty girls in white
and free egg rolls.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.440
Fez, I thought you said
heaven would be French maids...

01:17.520 --> 01:20.320
with licorice hair
and gumdrop nipples.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.840
Oh, no, that's my 30th birthday.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.320
Hi there.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.800
- So, do you work here?
- Yeah, I'm stuck here all night.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.600
That's good. 'Cause I'll probably be doin'
some things I'll regret later.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.520
If you're interested.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.520
Thanks for the offer,
but, uh, I have a girlfriend.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.120
What a coincidence.
I have a room.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.960
You know, I... don't
have a girlfriend.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.280
But I have, uh, written several love letters
to Barbara Walters, so, uh-

01:52.480 --> 01:55.960
Oh, Roy, you're goin' after
the wrong ones, man.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.200
You gotta think like a lion and pick off
the weakest member of the herd.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.480
Well, like that one, with the braces
and the desperate eyes.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.280
Oh, she's not makin' it
past sundown.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.760
[Growls]

02:20.320 --> 02:22.960
Aw! Look at him.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.640
All tuckered out from
a day of chasing nurses.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.440
<i>Yeah, he's like</i>
<i>a gigantic, horny baby.</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:32.320
I bet he's havin' sweet dreams.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.120
Welcome to the clinic
for sexy foreigners.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.480
Tell me where it hurts, baby.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.280
Oh, I have a bad case
of horniness for nurses.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.520
What you need is a sexy sponge bath.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.320
I like the way you... operate.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.560
How's that?

02:57.640 --> 03:00.320
- It's not bad.
- But I sure am.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.960
Yes, you are, naughty nurse.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.760
Maybe you need a little spanking.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.680
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Maybe I do.</i>

03:11.680 --> 03:14.960
Now, why don't you
turn your head and cough?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.720
Aah!

03:18.800 --> 03:21.960
- Oh, what's the problem, buddy?
- Aah!

03:23.680 --> 03:26.200
- What's the problem, buddy?
- Aah!

03:54.680 --> 03:57.480
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

04:03.460 --> 04:08.100
So, anyways, Eric, me and Joanne
feel real bad since Red fired you.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.820
So, we decided to get you a job...

04:10.900 --> 04:14.900
on account of we're pretty sure you're
not gonna be successful on your own.

04:14.980 --> 04:17.100
Isn't that great?

04:17.180 --> 04:19.779
See, now you can save up for school,
and we can get married.

04:19.860 --> 04:24.100
Wow. I had heard crazy rumors
that sometimes parents help children...

04:24.180 --> 04:28.580
but I just always thought
it was some kind of beautiful fairy tale.

04:28.660 --> 04:32.060
A position opened up at my company,
and it's yours if you want it.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.500
Oh, my God!
I'll take it. This is great!

04:35.580 --> 04:39.140
Yep. She's as generous in
real life as she is in the sack.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.340
[Groans]

04:44.620 --> 04:47.340
Wow, that's...
wildly inappropriate.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.940
So, Joanne, about my new job-
[Chuckles]

04:51.020 --> 04:53.580
- I don't even know where you work.
- The dog-food factory.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.500
The-

04:58.100 --> 05:00.140
The dog-food factory!

05:02.980 --> 05:05.100
I didn't see that comin'.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.380
- Hey!
- Hey.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.940
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was brutal!

05:10.980 --> 05:12.900
How can nurses wolf down
mini pizzas...

05:12.980 --> 05:16.300
right after watching
a film strip on butt rashes?

05:16.380 --> 05:19.500
Yeah. No, I know. Michael and I
were hangin' at The Hub...

05:19.580 --> 05:22.420
- and he told me it's been tough.
- What?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.860
No, no, no. You don't need to be
hangin' out with Kelso alone.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.140
- Why not?
- Because I don't trust him.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.940
Yeah, but don't you trust me?

05:29.020 --> 05:32.220
No!

05:32.300 --> 05:35.260
Haven't you been paying attention?
I don't trust anything.

05:35.340 --> 05:37.940
I don't trust the government.
I don't trust the newspapers.

05:38.020 --> 05:42.180
I'm not even sure what time we think it
is right now is really what time it is.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.780
But most of all, I don't trust you
and Kelso alone together.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.700
[Sighs]
All right.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.660
You know what?
I guess I deserve that.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.300
So, I promise I won't
be alone with Michael anymore.

05:51.380 --> 05:54.140
However, I do think you're
making a big deal out of nothing.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.860
That's what you said after you yelled
"get off my boyfriend"...

05:56.940 --> 05:59.740
- when you saw Kelso kissing Annette.
- Okay, what do I have to do...

05:59.780 --> 06:02.140
to get you to stop bringing that up?

06:07.140 --> 06:08.980
I'm not doing that.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.060
Then I'm gonna keep bringin' it up.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.180
All right!
Let's play some ball.

06:16.260 --> 06:19.420
Why would you slap me on the butt?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.580
Is there something about me
that would make you think...

06:23.620 --> 06:27.260
that I, a boy, would like you,
another boy, to put his hand on my butt?

06:28.740 --> 06:31.860
Uh, no?

06:31.940 --> 06:34.940
Then keep your hands
to yourself, butt-slapper.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.740
- [Chuckles]
- Okay.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.700
- Let's just play some ball.
- Yeah.

06:40.740 --> 06:43.540
All right. Me and Fez are shirts.
You and Donna be skins?

06:46.580 --> 06:49.660
Once again, Kelso, you're not gonna
fool me into being skins.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.580
Loosen up, Big "D."

06:52.660 --> 06:55.100
Fine!
We'll be skins!

06:57.060 --> 07:00.420
Oh, look at Mr. Handsome
taking his shirt off. [Chuckles]

07:00.500 --> 07:03.140
As if that were something
that I would dream about.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.220
Okay, what is your problem, man?

07:10.300 --> 07:12.220
It's just-

07:12.260 --> 07:15.540
Okay. Um...

07:15.620 --> 07:18.740
has anyone ever had a dream
where you were with a girl?

07:18.820 --> 07:21.780
Oh, hell, yeah.
Miss October.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.900
- Hey!
- And-And you know what I said to her?

07:23.940 --> 07:26.940
I said, "Get the hell out of
my dream, Miss October.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.660
I'm Donna's man."

07:29.740 --> 07:33.220
Now, has any of you
ever had a dream...

07:33.300 --> 07:35.980
where you were with
the opposite of a girl?

07:40.020 --> 07:41.940
Like two girls?
Sure.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.140
No. See, I had a dream...

07:49.820 --> 07:52.260
and it was erotic...

07:54.780 --> 07:57.060
and it was about Kelso.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.820
- What?
- Wow!

08:01.500 --> 08:03.660
Wow!

08:04.620 --> 08:06.780
That is awesome!

08:08.540 --> 08:11.380
Fez, you gotta tell us
about this dream.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.740
Wh- No!
You don't gotta!

08:15.460 --> 08:18.660
Look at him! He's undressing me
with his eyes right now!

08:18.740 --> 08:21.180
You undressed yourself,
you son of a bitch!

08:22.180 --> 08:24.900
Fez.

08:24.980 --> 08:27.020
Tell us what happened.

08:27.100 --> 08:31.140
And-And don't be afraid
to use colorful words like "sweaty"...

08:31.220 --> 08:33.140
or "fondle" or "forbidden."

08:33.220 --> 08:35.780
- Go ahead.
- Well...

08:35.860 --> 08:37.940
Kelso was a nurse.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.940
And there was sponging.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.620
Oh!

08:50.700 --> 08:55.300
But, hey, maybe- maybe the dream continued,
and we went to find some girls.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.180
- Well, did it continue?
- No!

08:58.220 --> 09:00.100
What could this mean?

09:00.140 --> 09:02.140
Well, isn't it obvious?

09:02.220 --> 09:04.380
It means that I'm gay!

09:13.920 --> 09:15.800
[Whines]

09:15.840 --> 09:18.360
Why is the dog on the counter?

09:18.440 --> 09:20.560
He likes to be tall.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.360
Where are you off to, honey?

09:25.440 --> 09:29.040
Oh, I'm off to a little thing I like
to call my new job.

09:29.120 --> 09:33.400
That's right. Despite both your best efforts
to keep me and Donna from getting married...

09:33.440 --> 09:37.560
I can now afford to, because I got a new job
at the dog-food factory.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.200
Dog food!

09:40.280 --> 09:42.640
Well, you finally made it, Son!

09:43.720 --> 09:45.560
Hey, I'll have you know...

09:45.640 --> 09:47.600
I am the coupon liaison.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.680
Do you even know what you're
getting yourself into?

09:50.760 --> 09:53.520
When I pass that factory
on my way home from fishing...

09:53.560 --> 09:58.000
I hold a dead fish up to my face,
so I don't have to smell it.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.240
Seriously.
Honey, dog food?

10:03.320 --> 10:05.480
[Whines]

10:05.560 --> 10:08.320
That is the worst part of the cow.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.560
You won't last the day.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.480
<i>- [Laughs]</i>
- I will last the day.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.840
And you know what?
Donna and I <i>are</i> getting married.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.280
And I'm sorry, but just because
of your attitude...

10:19.320 --> 10:22.320
no one here will be getting the employee
family discount on Pupper Supper.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.240
Thank you very much.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.280
Jackie!

10:27.320 --> 10:29.200
- I need to talk to you!
- No. No, no.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.040
You have to go. I cannot hang out
with you anymore. I promised.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.400
Jackie, I need to talk to you. Something
happened that could tear apart the group!

10:35.480 --> 10:38.040
I don't care. Okay?
You have to go right now.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.000
Jackie, Fez had
a sex dream about me.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.160
You poor baby!

10:44.720 --> 10:47.920
What if he's in love with me?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.480
I don't know that I can
return those feelings.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.720
No, of course you can't.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.440
I mean, sure, he's supercool...

10:57.880 --> 11:00.040
and he's good looking...

11:01.400 --> 11:03.320
and we have a ton in common.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.880
- But I can't-
- I know. I know, baby. I know.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.440
I just wonder what I did
to make this happen.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.480
I mean, should I have
tried to be less desirable?

11:14.560 --> 11:19.440
Michael, the beautiful cannot be held
responsible for the havoc our looks create.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.920
- That's true.
- Aw. Come here.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.240
No one understands me
like you do, Jackie.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.240
I told Jackie I don't want her
hangin' out with Kelso.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.320
I walk in, they're playing
couch Twister.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.440
And I don't know if something just happened
or something was about to happen.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.520
But you know what?
I don't care anymore.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.440
- Have you talked to her?
- No!

11:52.480 --> 11:54.920
Come on, man. I'm done talkin'.
I'm just glad I saw them.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.800
Now I can be the bigger person
and bail before she does.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.680
Yeah, that's what
I should've done with Lauren.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.040
And Susan.
And Janice.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.960
Ah, who am I kiddin'?
I'm just makin' these names up.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.800
Hey, Roy. I just need to
grab my check.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.840
Hey, Kelso, what the hell were you doin'
with my girlfriend on Donna's couch?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.600
Huh? That wasn't me.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.120
I saw you!

12:23.360 --> 12:25.720
Oh. Uh-

12:25.760 --> 12:29.640
Uh, well- Okay, look.
It wasn't what you think.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.080
Um, it was totally different.

12:32.160 --> 12:37.760
See, Fez had this
sex dream about me.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.640
And... I was, like, a nurse in it.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.440
And I was totally freakin' out,
and Jackie was just comforting me.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.840
I mean, 'cause, you know- [Whispering]
Fez had a sex dream about me.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.960
So your story is that you
were with Jackie...

12:54.040 --> 12:57.560
because Fez had
a boy-on-boy dream about you?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.000
[Chuckles]
It's crazy, huh?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.640
Kelso, that is
the worst lie you've told...

13:04.720 --> 13:07.640
since you claimed to be
the prince of South Carolina.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.320
No, I'm not lying about Fez's dream!

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
Wh- I was sponging him!

13:18.120 --> 13:20.000
It's the truth!

13:20.080 --> 13:22.320
Hey, I believe people
have dreams about you, man.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.080
I mean, put a blond wig on,
you're Goldie Hawn.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.960
I know that.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.520
Oh, Mr. Red.
I need some advice.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.440
I had an erotic dream about Kelso.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.760
Well, Joanne, thank you
for the factory tour.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.800
So, um, where is
the coupon liaison office?

13:57.880 --> 14:00.120
You're standing in it.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.480
Well, it's... big.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.000
And, look, you have a window.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.440
Maybe someday you can
climb up there and look out.

14:11.960 --> 14:17.080
Joanne, what exactly
is the coupon liaison?

14:24.040 --> 14:25.960
[Laughs]
Oh, oh!

14:26.040 --> 14:28.840
Look, girls, there's the boys!

14:28.920 --> 14:31.360
Hands off though.
They're minors.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.080
[Inhales, Exhales]
Mrs. Kitty...

14:35.160 --> 14:37.960
we need your medical expertise.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.240
Honey, if you've got V.D.,
I'm not looking at it.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.600
No!

14:43.680 --> 14:46.440
Fez had a dream and-

14:46.520 --> 14:49.280
[Whispering]
And I was doin' stuff to him in it.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.480
And I don't want to do it again!

14:53.560 --> 14:55.640
I'm scared to let him go to sleep!

14:55.680 --> 15:00.920
See, Kelso was a nurse.
And I had no shirt.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.080
And he had a sponge.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.080
A soft one!

15:07.160 --> 15:09.880
Okay, boys...

15:09.960 --> 15:14.200
dreams are- are just compilations
of what you experience during the day.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.040
- What did you do yesterday?
- Um, Kelso and I looked at nurses.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.680
Um, oh, and I ate 39 spicy egg rolls
that were on the floor.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.960
Well, spicy foods- there you go.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.880
You know, one time, I ate stuffed peppers
before I went to bed...

15:32.960 --> 15:35.560
and I dreamt that I ended a war...

15:35.640 --> 15:39.160
by giving the prime minister
a belly dance.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.960
So my dream didn't mean anything!

15:42.040 --> 15:44.600
Oh, thank God!

15:44.680 --> 15:47.520
I mean, I love you, Fez,
just not in that way.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.000
And my appreciation for your beauty
is purely aesthetic.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.880
You know what, Fez?
Maybe right now is not a great time...

15:57.960 --> 16:00.920
for you to be complimentin' my ass.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.440
Well, if it isn't
the conquering hero...

16:07.520 --> 16:11.280
home from a big day of dog food.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.760
Hey, I had a great day, okay?

16:14.840 --> 16:17.000
And by the way,
I'm nowhere near the actual food.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.600
I'm off with, like, the executives.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.440
<i>- [Schotzie Whining]</i>
- Really?

16:22.520 --> 16:27.120
<i>Well, Schotzie sure does</i>
<i>love the smell of executives.</i>

16:29.000 --> 16:33.760
Okay, look. Okay, maybe Eric
is working with dog food...

16:33.840 --> 16:36.920
but he's not complaining,
and he's not quitting.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.360
And we're gonna get married
no matter what you think...

16:39.440 --> 16:41.440
or how he smells.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.320
Aw, thanks, honey.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.240
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

16:49.840 --> 16:55.120
Look at you. You got that
great dog-food job now...

16:55.200 --> 16:57.480
and plenty of dog-food money
comin' in, and-

16:58.800 --> 17:02.200
I mean, you two are happy, right?

17:02.240 --> 17:04.800
- Very happy.
- Yes.
- Of course you are.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.319
And that's why I've changed my mind.

17:07.400 --> 17:11.560
This promising new career
in dog food has convinced me...

17:12.839 --> 17:15.640
that you two are mature enough
to get married.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.359
What?
A-Are you serious?

17:18.400 --> 17:23.440
Absolutely. Hey, let's get you happy kids
hitched as soon as possible.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.599
Like next week.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.000
Next week?

17:29.080 --> 17:32.160
Wow, that's- that's really soon.

17:32.240 --> 17:36.280
Yeah, I- Sooner than we thought.
We were thinkin', like...

17:36.320 --> 17:39.160
- someday.
- Yeah.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.880
- Yeah, someday. That's good.
- Yeah.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.040
Well, what's the matter?
I mean, uh...

17:44.120 --> 17:46.360
gettin' engaged is
a silly, fun thing to do...

17:46.440 --> 17:48.600
but now that we're talking
about an actual wedding...

17:48.640 --> 17:51.320
you're turning into a couple of
dumb-ass kids who aren't ready?

17:53.160 --> 17:56.480
'Cause, I mean, if you're not ready-
Heck, I got myself all excited for nothin'.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.400
<i>No, no. We're ready.</i>
<i>We are more than ready.</i>

17:59.480 --> 18:01.240
We're ready?

18:01.320 --> 18:03.200
Yeah. I mean-

18:04.440 --> 18:06.560
Well, I am if you are.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.080
Well, yeah. Sure,
I'm completely ready.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.400
<i>Well, that's great.</i>
<i>You know, it's all settled.</i>

18:14.480 --> 18:16.880
I'll just- I'll go call
the cake shop right now.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.840
So, it's, uh, a wedding.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.200
- Next week.
- Right.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.600
- Oh, I have some homework-
- Yeah, I gotta clean my room.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.720
Hey, Roy, where's Steven?
You know, I haven't seen him all day.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.640
You got a lot of nerve
showin' your face around here.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.360
Hyde saw you and Kelso
snuggled up on the couch.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.280
Tramp.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.720
- Wait. What?
- Yeah, I said, "tramp."

18:59.240 --> 19:01.400
Oh, my God.
I have to find Steven.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.000
Uh, d-don't tell him
I called you a tramp.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.800
I betJackie's been foolin' around
with Kelso this whole time.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.200
I feel like an idiot.

19:10.240 --> 19:14.360
Oh, my poor, little broody-brood.
[Laughs]

19:15.680 --> 19:17.520
You know, when I first met you...

19:17.600 --> 19:19.480
you were such a cute, little guy.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.200
And now you're-
you're a great, big guy with-

19:22.240 --> 19:27.160
with great, big hair and-
and great, big problems...

19:27.200 --> 19:30.120
my little broody-brood.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.080
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.400
There.
[Laughs]

19:40.960 --> 19:42.920
You may leave me now.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.280
Hey there. Still have
that girlfriend?

19:53.280 --> 19:55.360
- You know what? I don't know.
- Hmm.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.880
Let's go talk about it.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.320
Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman,
have you seen Steven?

20:04.400 --> 20:08.680
Oh, honey, I've had a couple sips of wine,
and I don't remember.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.400
Oh, but you know what you need?

20:13.440 --> 20:17.880
You need more umbrellas in your hair.
[Laughs]

20:17.960 --> 20:21.480
Oh, bartender,
we're gonna need more umbrellas.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.760
Welcome to the clinic
for sexy Kelsos.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.360
What can I do for you?

20:31.400 --> 20:34.920
Well, I'm here for my
supersexy sponge bath.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.280
But I have money,
so if you do other stuff too-

20:38.360 --> 20:40.640
<i>Oh, I'll do anything you want.</i>

20:40.680 --> 20:42.960
You're one good-lookin' stud!

20:43.040 --> 20:45.640
Right back at ya, handsome.
