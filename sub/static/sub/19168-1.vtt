- Tom, what's happening?
- You all right, Danny?

Yo, don't say I never do nothing for ya.

01:23.442 --> 01:24.775
Oh, sweet.

- Who's that?
- I didn't say it weren't secondhand.

01:33.192 --> 01:35.567
[woman] This morning,
we're gonna go over your revision sheets

01:35.650 --> 01:37.692
and take a look at exam prep.

If we don't hit the 60 percent pass rate,

we're gonna be spending a lot more time

So, Tom, how did you get on
with the exercises?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.317
Okay, Eileen, what about you?

01:58.400 --> 02:00.775
Yeah, it was all right.
One thing I didn't under...

02:00.858 --> 02:03.233
Man, it's painful watching you sometimes.

02:03.317 --> 02:04.817
- What?
- This.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.775
Everyone knows you've fancied
Lucy Walker since forever.

02:07.858 --> 02:10.067
Just man up and get it done, all right?

02:10.733 --> 02:13.775
Ooh, here she comes. This could be
your big chance to impress her.

02:13.858 --> 02:15.942
So, make sure you say something
really, really cool.

02:16.025 --> 02:18.400
- Go away, please.
- Tom.

02:18.483 --> 02:20.900
- Hey.
- Uh, did you get the science revision?

02:20.983 --> 02:23.567
- Yeah.
- No, I mean, like, did you <i>get</i> it?

02:23.650 --> 02:26.567
- Oh, did I get it? Yeah, I think so.
- Cool.

02:26.650 --> 02:30.650
Look at Tommy boy.
He's getting moist just talking to a girl.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.900

- What are you looking at?

02:33.983 --> 02:35.650
Fuck off.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.942
So, anyway, um, the science revision.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.233
I, uh, was wondering if you could help me
'cause I tried looking at it,

02:41.317 --> 02:44.608
and then I remembered I haven't paid
attention in science since, like, 2011.

02:44.692 --> 02:46.233
[chuckles]
I'll see what I can do.

02:46.317 --> 02:49.733
I mean, I can only work with what I got.
You're not exactly a model student.

after school, but come by later, yeah?

02:57.192 --> 02:58.150
Sure.

02:58.233 --> 03:03.692
- Charlie Gibbs or Charlie Penford?
- Uh, Charlie Gibbs. As in Charlotte?

03:03.775 --> 03:06.275
I haven't seen Charlie Penford in months.

03:06.358 --> 03:09.025
Right, of course. I mean,
it's none of my business, obviously.

03:09.108 --> 03:10.108
I'll see you later then.

03:10.192 --> 03:12.483

If someone said
for you to come around later,

03:30.317 --> 03:31.733
what time would you say that was?

03:31.817 --> 03:34.150
- Later than what?
- Than earlier.

03:35.942 --> 03:37.525
Like, eight, do you think, maybe?

03:37.608 --> 03:39.858
Well, that's certainly later on
than earlier.

03:40.775 --> 03:43.317
- What you writing?
- A romance novel.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.400

- Yes, they are.

07:05.817 --> 07:07.692

07:07.775 --> 07:08.900
Well, it's a brain,

07:08.983 --> 07:11.692
so we tend to think of all of it
as quite important.

07:11.775 --> 07:13.900

You've been out for nearly ten days, Tom.

07:28.108 --> 07:28.942
At the moment,

07:29.025 --> 07:31.858
nothing in there is moving around
in any way that worries us.

07:31.942 --> 07:34.858
- You were very lucky.
- Will there be, like, side effects?

07:34.942 --> 07:37.983
We're gonna keep an eye on you,
but if anything unusual happens,

07:38.067 --> 07:39.900
I want you to let me know straightaway.

07:39.983 --> 07:44.192
- Unusual, like, how?
- Just unusual.

07:51.275 --> 07:53.108
I should've done something.

07:54.108 --> 07:55.858
You did the only thing you could, love.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.650
- Have you seen her?
- No.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.775
It'll take a while, Tom.

08:04.858 --> 08:07.942
Is there something about my grandson
you find particularly fascinating?

08:08.025 --> 08:10.775
- No, no, no.
- Well, stop bloody staring at him, then.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.942

08:13.025 --> 08:16.108
Well, thank you
for your considered medical opinion.

08:16.192 --> 08:19.567
Maybe, next time, I'll get the doctor
to drive us and you to do the operation.

08:19.650 --> 08:22.442
- How about that?
- Calm down, love.

08:22.525 --> 08:23.775
It's only an observation.

08:41.942 --> 08:42.942
[sighs]

08:47.775 --> 08:48.775
So, how you feeling?

08:50.400 --> 08:52.858
- How's the head?
- It's all right.

08:58.025 --> 09:00.608
- How's it look?
- Already, it looks better.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.150
We need to even this up a bit.

09:06.900 --> 09:10.233
You know, if you feel up to it,
maybe later you should go to Lucy.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.608
- No, she's not gonna want to see me.
- Of course, she is.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.150
I ran away, Nan.

Anyone could be forgiven
for running out of that flat, Tom.

But someone who kept running afterwards
when she really needed them?

09:24.692 --> 09:26.025

Who says that?

I mean, come on.
He said he was gonna call me.

09:33.067 --> 09:35.608
Then, when I saw him,
he said he was out of credit.

but he's got a line, you know?

15:32.608 --> 15:36.567
- Yeah, but what if he was? What do I do?
- Look, he wasn't there.

Did you hear what I said? Party tonight.

16:16.483 --> 16:19.775
- Oh. Hadn't heard about it.
- Yeah, he might not have invited you.

16:19.858 --> 16:21.525
Everyone still thinks
you're in a coma now.

16:21.608 --> 16:23.983
- Right.
- But you should come.

16:26.358 --> 16:29.192

You know what else is funny?
I know where you live, you little...

- What the fuck are you...?
- All right, Eugene.

20:52.358 --> 20:55.067
- Chill out, bruv. Hey, just chill out.
- Get him out of here now.

20:55.150 --> 20:56.692

- Take him back to Nanny, bruv.

20:56.775 --> 20:59.400

[can clattering]

21:04.983 --> 21:06.775
What's the matter with you?

21:06.858 --> 21:09.233
Do you want another hole in your head?

21:09.317 --> 21:11.150
You start a fight in there,
you ain't gonna win it.

21:12.608 --> 21:14.692
They were there.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.650
- What you talking about?
- At Lucy's.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.192
When are you gonna get it
through your head that this wasn't them?

21:20.275 --> 21:22.900
[scoffs]
You talk like you're not one of them.

21:22.983 --> 21:25.608
I know they've already got you selling.
What, you think this won't escalate?

21:27.400 --> 21:29.775
Don't be a dickhead about it, Tom.

21:29.858 --> 21:31.442
I'm doing what I want.

21:31.525 --> 21:35.150
You get that? You know what? One day,
it'll be me at the top giving out orders,

21:35.233 --> 21:38.192
and it won't be none of this shit,
just business.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.983
Tom, I can't always be there, you know.

- [chuckles] Sorry.

22:43.525 --> 22:48.150

- It was all right. Didn't miss much.

22:51.192 --> 22:52.067

Good.

Yeah?

- Yeah.
- That's good.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.692
Maybe you'll be able to come
back to school soon.

23:06.150 --> 23:09.567
- Yeah, maybe.
- Boring without you there.

23:12.108 --> 23:14.275
Got no one to throw chips at
in the canteen.

23:15.442 --> 23:19.233
- Like you'd ever dare throw chips at me.
- Yeah, what would you do about it?

23:19.317 --> 23:21.150
Give you a slap, obviously.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.108
[chuckles] You'd have to find
a chair to stand on first.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.025
[chuckles]

23:28.108 --> 23:32.067
You're gonna regret all this talk
when I'm owning you in front of everyone.

Okay. I wouldn't mind that so much.

30:32.150 --> 30:35.275
we will be discussing with you
future planning.

Now, as you know, many of the top here
will be, uh, taking their exams soon.

God, how did that even happen?

31:45.942 --> 31:46.983
Don't know.

- Should we listen to some music?

33:27.900 --> 33:30.108

33:30.192 --> 33:31.817
<i>Look, if you can pay the 600 now,</i>

33:31.900 --> 33:33.817
<i>then we can stop the added interest
on the account,</i>

33:33.900 --> 33:35.358
<i>but until then, my hands are tied.</i>

- Wait, hold on.</i>

33:46.692 --> 33:49.358
<i>It's saying the payment's been made.
The account's coming up as cleared.</i>

33:49.442 --> 33:51.608
<i>- I think this might be an error.
- Oh, an error?</i>

33:51.692 --> 33:53.608
I thought the system was
a hundred percent accurate?

33:53.692 --> 33:55.608
- Hold on a minute.
- [door opens, closes]

33:57.858 --> 33:58.692
Right.

34:00.108 --> 34:03.150
I don't reckon
I could live on a canal boat.

34:03.233 --> 34:06.358
- Why not?
- It's too low down.

34:06.442 --> 34:09.733
I really like being able to see
all of the city and the little people

My mum just watches me constantly.

34:35.567 --> 34:39.650
It's like she thinks I'm gonna throw
myself off the balcony or something.

34:43.233 --> 34:44.733
I've never been the victim.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.775
It doesn't feel right.

34:47.858 --> 34:50.317
- I don't see you like that.
- Yeah, you do.

34:52.483 --> 34:53.608
But it's all right.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.108
You'll get there.

35:00.108 --> 35:03.900
You know, out of everyone,

35:03.983 --> 35:08.275
you're the only person
who has come to see me.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.025
- Luce, what happened?
- Tom...

35:13.108 --> 35:15.692
No, I... I just...

35:16.900 --> 35:18.317
I want you to know you can...

35:20.983 --> 35:23.692
I want you to feel safe when I'm around.

35:23.775 --> 35:24.775
What I mean is,

35:24.858 --> 35:27.733
if we were in trouble again, I want you
to know that I wouldn't run this time.

35:27.817 --> 35:29.108
I'd stay.

35:29.192 --> 35:31.483
Even if it meant I'd die, I'd just...

35:33.525 --> 35:34.942
I just want you to know that.

35:40.192 --> 35:41.192
Okay.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.692
Same.

35:48.108 --> 35:50.150
Did I ever tell you
about when I got locked out

35:50.233 --> 35:52.317
on your roof overnight
with, uh, what's-her-face?

35:52.442 --> 35:53.692
- No.
- Alice.

35:53.775 --> 35:56.192
Do you know Alice?
She sat, like, left of you in...

35:56.275 --> 35:57.650
- ...math?
- I think so.

35:57.733 --> 36:00.358
We thought it'd be a really good idea
to go and sit up there, and...

36:00.442 --> 36:01.275
Lucy!

36:02.567 --> 36:04.442
- Oh, shit.
- You all right?

36:05.233 --> 36:06.442
Yeah?

36:06.525 --> 36:08.150
Heard about
what happened to you and Ben.

36:09.067 --> 36:12.525
That's messed up, you know.
But they'll get what's coming to 'em.

36:12.608 --> 36:14.900
- I promise you that.
- Right.

36:16.233 --> 36:18.775
You don't think it's nothing
to do with us, do ya?

36:19.942 --> 36:22.400
- Why would I think that?
- No, exactly.

36:24.858 --> 36:26.442
'Cause, you know, since it happened,

36:26.525 --> 36:30.192
some little prick has been playing
these childish games with us.

36:31.483 --> 36:33.525
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you, Luce?

36:34.775 --> 36:36.192
No.

36:38.067 --> 36:40.983
- 'Cause I think you might...
- Leave it, Eugene.

36:42.358 --> 36:45.483

36:45.567 --> 36:48.192

- What about me?

- Look at my legs, bruv!
- Stop fucking revving the car, bruv!

38:49.150 --> 38:50.900
Hey, yo, there's smoke
coming from the car, fam!

Yo, what's the difference
between shepherd's pie and cottage pie?

40:43.983 --> 40:46.733
No, it's the potatoes, innit, man?

40:46.817 --> 40:50.275
Mashed potatoes are fluffy,
like sheep. Shepherd's pie.

40:50.358 --> 40:55.483
Cottage pies have them square potatoes,
like the roof of a cottage.

- Get the fuck out of here, man.

40:58.067 --> 40:59.692

[chuckles]

43:31.650 --> 43:34.108
Yeah, heard that as well.

43:34.192 --> 43:35.358
What an idiot.

43:37.192 --> 43:40.108
Well, you know,
maybe this is just the start.

43:40.192 --> 43:43.108
Maybe he's gonna change
this place for the better.

43:43.192 --> 43:46.317
What? By setting fire to cars
and getting into fights?

43:47.233 --> 43:49.983
To clean this place up,
he'll have to do a lot more than that.

52:58.650 --> 53:00.858
You know, I see your mom in you
when I look at you.

53:00.942 --> 53:02.775
- She was a junkie.
- She was your mother.

53:02.858 --> 53:04.567
And she was my daughter.

53:05.983 --> 53:09.525
She made mistakes, but she was kind.

53:09.608 --> 53:12.817
And she was good. She loved you.

53:14.150 --> 53:18.775
She didn't know how to cope,
and I should have been there for her.

53:19.692 --> 53:22.567
So, I will say to you
what I wished I had said to her.

53:24.442 --> 53:25.567
I love you.

53:28.233 --> 53:29.692
Come home.

53:32.983 --> 53:33.817
Don't wait up.

53:35.108 --> 53:38.942
[door opens, closes]

53:40.067 --> 53:41.067
[boy]
Yay!

53:41.150 --> 53:43.650
[indistinct chatter]

53:46.567 --> 53:49.567
You all right, sweetheart?
Looking for some business?

53:49.650 --> 53:52.358
I got a tenner somewhere.
Could do with a little sucky-suck.

53:52.442 --> 53:56.358
Why don't you take that tenner
and shove it up your ass, my darling?

53:56.442 --> 53:59.317
I knew your granddad back in the day.
We used to call him "The Pencil."

53:59.400 --> 54:00.858
- Know what I mean?
- [all laughing]

54:00.942 --> 54:01.817
Shut up, man.

54:02.608 --> 54:05.567
- Ms. Harvey.
- Yeah, Danny, can I have a word?

54:06.108 --> 54:09.942
Tell me, have you noticed
Tom behaving oddly recently?

54:10.025 --> 54:12.942
[chuckles]
He's always been odd, but...

54:13.025 --> 54:15.442
Yeah, he's been different
since the accident.

54:15.525 --> 54:19.275
- It wasn't an accident.
- No, I suppose not.

54:20.317 --> 54:22.233
But, yeah, he has changed. He...

54:22.317 --> 54:23.317
[sighs]

54:23.400 --> 54:27.233
He's angry, and I...
I don't know what he's gonna do.

54:29.025 --> 54:31.275
But I do know I don't want him
to get hurt anymore,

54:31.358 --> 54:33.317
so will you look out for him, Danny?

54:33.400 --> 54:37.483
Yeah, yeah. Of course, I will, Ms. Harvey.
I'll definitely do that.

54:37.567 --> 54:40.108
You're a good boy. Thanks.

54:40.192 --> 54:42.108
[siren wailing in distance]

54:54.817 --> 54:56.150
[car beeps, door unlocks]

54:58.192 --> 54:59.358
[car door opens]

55:01.233 --> 55:02.483
[car door closes]

55:02.567 --> 55:05.025
- [phone dings, vibrates]
- [indistinct chatter on TV]

55:16.608 --> 55:18.192
[car engine starts]

56:09.608 --> 56:10.442
Shit.

56:11.733 --> 56:14.567
[helicopter whirring in distance]

56:32.525 --> 56:34.983
[indistinct police radio chatter]

59:33.108 --> 59:34.108
Get on him.

59:37.650 --> 59:38.858

- Step him out!

59:48.983 --> 59:52.692
[high-pitched electronic screeching]

59:52.775 --> 59:54.358
[all screaming]

59:54.442 --> 59:56.358
[screeching continues]

01:00:05.858 --> 01:00:08.983
Knock this shit out!
[groans, shouts]

[screaming]

Lucy.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.233
Nice of you to show up, Tom.

01:01:55.192 --> 01:01:58.692
- I know. I'm... I'm sorry I wasn't there.
- No, listen.

01:01:58.775 --> 01:02:01.858
You said you would come with me.
You said that.

01:02:01.942 --> 01:02:03.733
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

01:02:04.858 --> 01:02:06.358
Look, I'm sorry. I've been busy.

01:02:06.442 --> 01:02:08.483
- I promise you, I'll make it up to you.
- Busy?

01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:10.650
I wish I could explain,
but things have been...

01:02:10.733 --> 01:02:13.567
- I haven't been myself.
- No, seriously, Tom, just forget it.

01:02:19.942 --> 01:02:21.358
[gasps]

01:02:48.525 --> 01:02:49.525
Cass, man.

01:02:51.483 --> 01:02:52.900
I've known him since forever.

01:02:55.025 --> 01:02:56.567
He was a dickhead, but...

01:02:58.358 --> 01:02:59.317
Yeah.

01:03:01.858 --> 01:03:03.150
So, what happened to you?

01:03:05.025 --> 01:03:07.692
Oh, just... got jumped, that's all.

01:03:09.233 --> 01:03:10.817
I haven't seen you around lately.

01:03:13.567 --> 01:03:14.942
Been revising.

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.900
It's not what I've heard.

01:03:17.983 --> 01:03:20.317
My cousin Tia says
you haven't been in exams.

01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.567
It's a shame, man.

01:03:24.858 --> 01:03:26.817
I always thought
you'd be the one to go places.

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.108
Who killed Cass, Danny?

01:03:33.858 --> 01:03:35.067
If you ask me...

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:37.733
I blame that hacker.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.608
He started shit
that could only end one way.

01:03:46.233 --> 01:03:49.442
- See you around, Tom.
- See you around.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.358
- [girl] <i>Did you hear about that Cass guy?</i>
- [boy] <i>That Cass guy...</i>

01:04:09.525 --> 01:04:14.358
[overlapping chatter continues]

01:04:14.442 --> 01:04:17.317
Why don't you tell me a little bit
about what's going on with you?

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.858
It's just... this pain in my head...
I just... I need the pieces...

01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:23.983
You've gotta find some way... I just...

01:04:24.067 --> 01:04:26.358
- You need to operate.
- Well, look...

01:04:26.442 --> 01:04:27.775
Just take the pieces
out of my fucking brain!

01:04:27.858 --> 01:04:29.650
Hey, hey. Okay, okay.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:32.150
There's not a lot that we can do about it.

01:04:32.233 --> 01:04:35.317
These fragments have moved
a lot deeper into your brain tissue.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.067
- There's just no safe way that we can...
- What if I pay you?

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:39.942
Well, then I'd be in private practice,

01:04:40.025 --> 01:04:42.150
but I'm afraid
I would still have to say no.

01:04:42.233 --> 01:04:44.025
You've got to help.

01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:46.317
Things haven't been the same
since it's happened.

01:04:48.608 --> 01:04:50.900
[sighs]
Look...

01:04:50.983 --> 01:04:54.650
Perhaps, I'm not the kind of doctor
that you need to be talking to.

01:05:20.942 --> 01:05:22.233
[objects clattering]

01:05:49.108 --> 01:05:50.525
You're gonna need some more milk.

01:05:57.108 --> 01:05:57.942
Hello, Wendy.

01:05:59.858 --> 01:06:01.983
I've just been reading
some of your stories.

01:06:02.067 --> 01:06:04.067
You're a dark horse, aren't you?

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.817
Ellman, what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.317
After all these years,
can't we at least be civil?

01:06:10.108 --> 01:06:12.150
You leave us alone, you fucking bastard!

01:06:12.692 --> 01:06:14.442
- Nan!
- Cutz.

01:06:14.525 --> 01:06:16.483
Really? The granny?

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:21.442
[scoffs] Put her on the bed.
Make sure she's breathing.

01:06:21.525 --> 01:06:23.692
- Let me see her.
- Don't worry, she'll be all right.

01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:25.067
We'll keep an eye on her.

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:28.817
Cutz is a man with a hammer
in a world of china. Know what I mean?

01:06:29.983 --> 01:06:31.692
Keon, let him go.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.733
- [chuckling]
- You're gonna wish you hadn't done that.

01:06:38.858 --> 01:06:41.067
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna
fucking do, you little prick?

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:42.483
Cutz, enough.

01:06:49.942 --> 01:06:51.692
I grew up in this tower block.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.525
My bedroom looked out
the same side as this.

01:06:55.608 --> 01:06:57.317
- View's changed a bit.
- What do you want?

01:06:58.358 --> 01:07:00.358
To reminisce uninterrupted. Is that okay?

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.608
You see, back in the day,
when I was in short trousers,

01:07:03.692 --> 01:07:05.192
this whole area was a shit-hole.

01:07:05.275 --> 01:07:08.900
Now, it's just us...
in the shadow of millionaires.

01:07:10.108 --> 01:07:11.317
How many lads from the estate

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.233
do you think make it up
those skyscrapers, Tom?

01:07:14.317 --> 01:07:16.608
We have different towers
to climb, don't we?

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.650
So...

01:07:21.692 --> 01:07:25.483
You called. Here I am.
What did you want to say to me?

01:07:27.692 --> 01:07:31.692
No? These moments are always better
in our head, aren't they?

01:07:31.775 --> 01:07:34.108
The French have a word for it.

01:07:34.192 --> 01:07:36.817
But then they have a word
for fucking everything.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.817
- I wanted to hurt you.
- Okay, good.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.900
- Now, we're getting somewhere.
- Not anymore.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.608
- You're not worth it. It's over now.
- It's pretty far from over, Tom.

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:53.108
You don't call the devil
then get upset when he turns up.

01:07:53.192 --> 01:07:55.108
You're not the devil. You're just a cunt.

01:07:55.192 --> 01:07:56.358
[chuckles]

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:58.900
I suppose I am a bit, yeah.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.233
What was that?

01:08:04.483 --> 01:08:06.025
What is it you're doing?

01:08:06.733 --> 01:08:10.067
You've got a little look in your eye
like you're busy.

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.858
Are you, Tom?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.650
Are you busy little bee?

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:17.858
What you looking for?

01:08:20.358 --> 01:08:21.858
Do you know?

01:08:21.942 --> 01:08:27.358
I've heard rumors that you can tap
into phones with just your mind.

01:08:27.442 --> 01:08:30.817
Break into bank accounts
with the click of a finger.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:34.942
- Sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

01:08:35.733 --> 01:08:37.192
But do you know...

01:08:37.274 --> 01:08:38.649
I happen to think...

01:08:41.483 --> 01:08:42.399
that it's true?

01:08:44.692 --> 01:08:46.317
I wouldn't know anything about that.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:47.899
[sighs]

01:08:47.983 --> 01:08:49.483
[scoffs]
Don't do that.

01:08:49.567 --> 01:08:51.774
That's the difference
between us and them.

01:08:53.192 --> 01:08:55.942
They have a modicum of talent,
they shout it from the rooftops.

01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:58.442
Us? We have a talent,
we get told to shut up.

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:01.024
"Don't show off.
Don't be such a clever bastard."

01:09:01.108 --> 01:09:06.192
You're special, Tom.
Don't ever, ever pretend that you're not.

01:09:08.192 --> 01:09:09.274
All right, I'm special.

01:09:10.983 --> 01:09:12.733
What's it got to do with you?

01:09:16.524 --> 01:09:20.817
My one gift,
if I may be so bold, is vision.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:23.524
I want to help you fulfill your potential.

01:09:24.192 --> 01:09:27.567
I want to give you the opportunity
to change the world.

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:30.692
You mean the opportunity
to make a lot of money.

01:09:30.774 --> 01:09:34.442
- An obscene amount of money.
- I'll pass.

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:37.899
- Why?
- 'Cause go fuck yourself, that's why.

01:09:38.983 --> 01:09:40.192
Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:44.149
Okay.

01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:48.649
Okay. Well...

01:09:50.442 --> 01:09:52.108
It was worth a shot.

01:09:57.358 --> 01:10:00.192
I've spent a lot of money
bailing my boys out of police custody,

01:10:00.275 --> 01:10:01.942
so you owe me.

01:10:02.025 --> 01:10:05.358
Now, I want you to ask yourself
one very important question.

01:10:06.442 --> 01:10:11.400
"Where, oh, where is Lucy?"

01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:16.317
[gasps]

01:10:18.775 --> 01:10:20.400
You see her, don't you?

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.942
She's got nothing to do with any of this.

01:10:25.067 --> 01:10:26.733
That's entirely up to you.

01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:36.483
I don't like this.

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:39.108
Next time, get a note
from your fucking mom or something.

01:10:39.192 --> 01:10:41.608
- I can't kill no girl.
- It ain't gonna come to that!

01:10:41.692 --> 01:10:43.817
- Yeah, what if it does?
- I'm right here, you know.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.983
Yeah, we see you.

01:10:45.067 --> 01:10:49.233
What, just like you've seen me
every fucking day since nursery?

01:10:49.317 --> 01:10:51.233
Does that mean nothing?

01:10:54.858 --> 01:10:56.192
Come on, Ant.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.150
We grew up together.

01:10:59.942 --> 01:11:01.608
Our moms used to walk us home
from school together.

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.608
We used to play
in that little park by the estate?

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:06.650
- Fuck this, man!
- Oi, gag her or something, Haz.

01:11:06.733 --> 01:11:08.775
I can't listen to her shit anymore, man.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.942
- So, how does it work, then?
- I woke up with it after they shot me.

01:11:24.025 --> 01:11:25.025
[chuckles]

01:11:25.108 --> 01:11:27.692
- You get shot and you get super powers.
- Yes.

01:11:27.775 --> 01:11:30.650
- Most people just get dead.
- Lucky, I guess.

01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:32.900
That's yet to be established.

01:11:34.567 --> 01:11:38.317
- So go on. Show me what you can do.
- I won't steal for you.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.150
I think you probably might, though.

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:48.317
You're gonna do what I say,
or I'm gonna burn your world down.

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.733
Danny, can you come in here, please?

01:11:53.817 --> 01:11:55.942
It was young Daniel here
who first suggested

01:11:56.025 --> 01:11:57.942
you might be our masked man.

01:11:58.817 --> 01:12:02.483
And do you know? He didn't even want
to be here to see if he was right.

01:12:02.567 --> 01:12:05.608
- How long have you known Danny?
- My whole life.

01:12:05.692 --> 01:12:07.233
Your whole life.

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:12.483
I've never even met the guy
and yet, he gave you up to me.

01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:15.733
Do you know why?

01:12:19.567 --> 01:12:21.400
Little pictures of the Queen.

01:12:23.525 --> 01:12:27.567
If you're gonna betray a friend,
look him in the eye while you do it.

01:12:29.942 --> 01:12:31.358
Little pictures of Elizabeth.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.525
Open your mouth, Danny.

01:12:39.608 --> 01:12:40.775
Open your fucking mouth.

01:12:45.192 --> 01:12:47.567
[breathing heavily]

01:12:50.608 --> 01:12:53.317
In case you're wondering,
that's what power looks like.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.567
Now...

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.900
You're gonna put funds
into my bank account...

01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:00.942
because I know you can do it,

01:13:01.025 --> 01:13:03.817
and I know you're not gonna let me do
the things I'm willing to do if you don't.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400
Give me your phone, Danny.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.608
Now, fuck off.

01:13:13.567 --> 01:13:17.108
Okay, none of us are getting any younger.
Let's get this done.

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.650
Be a dear and fill her up, will you?

01:13:28.275 --> 01:13:29.275
[Ellman gasps]

01:13:30.192 --> 01:13:31.317
[chuckles]

01:13:32.525 --> 01:13:34.192
Is that as fast as you can go?

01:13:36.608 --> 01:13:39.108
I could just dump the entire
Bank of England in there, but...

01:13:39.192 --> 01:13:41.442
I think people might start
asking questions.

01:13:41.525 --> 01:13:42.358
[chuckles]

01:13:42.442 --> 01:13:45.650
You see, I still like this guy
despite everything.

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.733
You're a special kid, Tom.

01:13:52.025 --> 01:13:53.567
A special kid.

01:13:55.775 --> 01:13:57.025
Looks like we're doing it.

01:13:58.358 --> 01:13:59.567
I'm gonna put an X on it.

01:14:00.567 --> 01:14:01.483
Yeah?

01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:05.608
Whoever gets the X has got to do it.
Put your hands out.

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:07.942
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:08.025 --> 01:14:09.692
- What'd you expect...?
- Don't talk to her.

01:14:09.775 --> 01:14:13.317
Well, I wouldn't shoot
an unarmed girl tied to a chair.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400
Shut up.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.692
But I guess I'm not a big man
like you, Eugene.

01:14:16.775 --> 01:14:18.900
Shut up! Just shut the fuck up!

01:14:18.983 --> 01:14:22.650
Why don't you just fucking do it, then?
Isn't that what you want?

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.817
- Hey, yo, calm down, man. Come on, man.
- Don't test me, man!

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.567
- Chill, mate! Chill, man!
- Get the fuck off me!

01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:30.400
- [overlapping chatter]
- [siren wailing]

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.983
- Help!
-Hurry up!

01:14:34.067 --> 01:14:35.858
- Shut up.
- [muffled screaming]

01:14:35.942 --> 01:14:38.650
- We gotta fucking go, man!
- Hurry up, man!

01:14:43.275 --> 01:14:44.608
What just happened?

01:14:45.983 --> 01:14:46.817
Nothing.

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.650
Cutz, check in with the warehouse.

01:14:53.817 --> 01:14:57.358
[muffled grunting, panting]

01:15:01.317 --> 01:15:02.817
[phone vibrating]

01:15:05.108 --> 01:15:06.067
Turn it off.

01:15:08.108 --> 01:15:08.942
Fuck.

01:15:11.358 --> 01:15:12.900
No answer, boss.

01:15:16.442 --> 01:15:19.275
All right, let's take this on the road.

01:15:25.733 --> 01:15:27.233
[boys chuckling]

01:15:27.317 --> 01:15:30.733
They're gone. Oi, they're gone.

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:33.317
[laughing]
That was fucking close, bruv.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.775
[indistinct chatter, laughing]

01:15:37.858 --> 01:15:41.025
Oh, shit. You fucked up.

01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:08.483
Tom... of the Crowley Estate Harpers.

01:16:09.358 --> 01:16:13.275
I knew your mum back in the day.
She was a good time girl.

01:16:13.358 --> 01:16:15.442
She could light up a room
with her hand jobs.

01:16:15.525 --> 01:16:17.942
[men laughing]

01:16:18.025 --> 01:16:20.317
You must have been, what,
three when she died?

01:16:21.358 --> 01:16:23.567
- Two.
- Two?

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:25.483
I knew her well, you know.

01:16:27.067 --> 01:16:27.900
Very well.

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:33.692
Gosh, you don't think...

01:16:34.567 --> 01:16:36.442
[men laughing]

01:16:37.983 --> 01:16:40.650
We both certainly like getting
into a lot of trouble, don't we?

01:16:51.775 --> 01:16:53.692
I wasn't actually gonna kill you, Luce.

01:16:54.692 --> 01:16:56.400
- No?
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:58.192 --> 01:16:59.108
Calm down.

01:16:59.942 --> 01:17:04.692
I never used to think you could
rape me... either, Eugene.

01:17:06.025 --> 01:17:08.150
'Cause we grew up together.

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:11.608
And we were friends, remember?

01:17:11.692 --> 01:17:15.525
- What happened was fucked up, I admit...
- You don't get to talk about it!

01:17:15.608 --> 01:17:17.650
Fuck you, Ant!

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.817
Fuck all of you!

01:17:23.733 --> 01:17:24.942
Tell me you're ashamed.

01:17:25.025 --> 01:17:26.358
- I'm ashamed.
- Honestly, I'm ashamed.

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:29.400
- I'm ashamed. I swear that I'm ashamed.
- No!

01:17:31.483 --> 01:17:33.025
You're scared!

01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:40.150
If you were ashamed,
you wouldn't be able to even look at me.

01:17:42.442 --> 01:17:45.317
So, don't fucking look at me!

01:17:50.275 --> 01:17:51.525
Get on your knees, all of you.

01:17:51.608 --> 01:17:52.942
- Lucy, Lucy...
- Now!

01:17:53.025 --> 01:17:55.733
- Lucy, you don't have to do this, please.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.858
I don't know what happened to you.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:17.817
Well...

01:18:19.567 --> 01:18:22.567
I have to admit I was expecting you
to be rather more restrained than this,

01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:23.692
young lady.

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:25.567
Bravo.

01:18:27.442 --> 01:18:29.483
Boys, can you come out here, please?

01:18:33.525 --> 01:18:34.983
You haven't shot them, have you?

01:18:37.025 --> 01:18:37.858
Oh, good.

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:43.817
Gentlemen, everything under control?
Only, the hostage has got the gun.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.483
- Lucy!
- [both grunting]

01:18:48.567 --> 01:18:50.067
Don't fucking move.

01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:51.400
Tom?

01:18:53.525 --> 01:18:54.733
Natural order is restored.

01:18:56.525 --> 01:18:58.150
Come on, Tom, up you get.

01:18:59.442 --> 01:19:01.275
By the way,
I wanted to apologize personally

01:19:01.358 --> 01:19:03.650
for the indignities you had to suffer.

01:19:03.733 --> 01:19:05.025
Young people today...

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.400
Like animals, you know?

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:13.233
I wouldn't like me, either.

01:19:18.067 --> 01:19:19.400
Continue.

01:19:26.317 --> 01:19:27.608
Come on, Tom.

01:19:28.817 --> 01:19:29.858
I'm trying.

01:19:33.983 --> 01:19:35.400
A bit of performance anxiety?

Come on!

01:19:50.942 --> 01:19:53.358
[beeping continues]

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.358
If I gave you the option to walk away,
would you take it?

01:19:58.442 --> 01:19:59.608
What?

01:19:59.692 --> 01:20:04.275
If I gave you the option to walk away
and never come back, would you take it?

01:20:05.942 --> 01:20:07.525
Why the fuck would I do that?

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.233
Just thought I'd ask first.

01:20:12.317 --> 01:20:13.650

Oh, Tommy.

01:24:20.817 --> 01:24:21.692
What do you want?

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.150
Here's the money Ellman gave me.

01:24:29.525 --> 01:24:32.775
What I did was unforgivable. I know that.

01:24:32.858 --> 01:24:36.275
I know we're done.
I just wanted to do right by you.

01:24:36.358 --> 01:24:38.983
[scoffs]
Why? 'Cause we were friends?

01:24:40.067 --> 01:24:41.317
Or 'cause you're scared of me?

01:24:44.067 --> 01:24:45.067
Keep it. I don't want it.

01:24:46.817 --> 01:24:50.233
I reckon you did us all a favor,
you know, taking him out.

01:24:51.483 --> 01:24:54.483
I'm just saying, I know you're probably
beating yourself up about it,

01:24:54.567 --> 01:24:58.608
but, guys like that, they gotta get got.

01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:05.358
You know, Danny, I was thinking,
I went after everyone in that video,

01:25:05.442 --> 01:25:08.233
but I didn't stop to think
about who was filming.

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:13.817
Maybe you'll get him yet.

01:25:15.817 --> 01:25:17.025
Peace, Tom.

01:25:20.067 --> 01:25:20.900
Yo.

01:25:22.275 --> 01:25:23.400
Give it to you down there.

01:25:31.567 --> 01:25:32.442
Don't jump.

01:25:35.317 --> 01:25:37.150
Unless you can fly now, too.

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:38.942
Is that another one
of your magical powers?

01:25:41.692 --> 01:25:46.233
- So, things got pretty mental back there.
- People got hurt, Tom.

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.275
I know.

01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:52.817
- I mean, I literally shot a guy.
- I'm sorry, Lucy.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.525
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.942
All right.

01:25:58.025 --> 01:25:59.192
I forgive you.

01:26:01.067 --> 01:26:03.775
I see his face whenever I close my eyes.

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:09.233
I see a lot of faces when I close my eyes.
I don't know if it ever really goes away.

01:26:11.317 --> 01:26:13.817
But I'll help you if you help me.

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:25.650
You know, there are restaurants in town.

01:26:25.733 --> 01:26:29.192
People go and then other people
cook for them. It's really great.

01:26:29.275 --> 01:26:31.275
- You should try it.
- [chuckles]

01:26:32.692 --> 01:26:33.858
The view's pretty good, though.

01:26:39.358 --> 01:26:41.483
So, are you gonna stick around, then?

01:26:45.608 --> 01:26:46.900
In case you need me?

01:26:48.358 --> 01:26:50.067
In case I want you.
