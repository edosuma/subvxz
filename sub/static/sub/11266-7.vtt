WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.379
Previously on 90210:
Sasha told me
she was HIV positive.

00:04.421 --> 00:06.173
And I thought I had it.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.633
I was trying to push you away.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.050
While we were broken up,

00:09.092 --> 00:10.302
I slept with Oscar.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.053
Pretending you wrote a song

00:12.095 --> 00:14.222
you actually stole
from a dead man.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.223
Okay, well, that's not...

00:15.265 --> 00:17.893
I have a recording of Javier

00:17.935 --> 00:19.227
singing it six months ago.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.521
Stay away from me.

00:20.562 --> 00:21.772
I'm not gonna tell anybody
that we hooked up.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.400
What's the matter, baby?
Nothing.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.068
Why aren't you...?

00:27.110 --> 00:29.070
'Cause you're just not that hot.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.406
I get what you're going through.
I went through it, too.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.074
You wouldn't accept help
from me, so I told my mom

00:33.116 --> 00:34.242
to do me a favor
and offer you a job.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.870
I don't believe this.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.413
She can never know
we had a romance.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.915
Nothing ever happened
between us.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.250
And now that I'm crashing here,
nothing ever can.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.920
I don't want anyone else
to know that Cannon raped me.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.380
Who you gonna tell?

00:46.421 --> 00:48.173
OFFICER: I think you should
still press charges.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.925
You just have to prepare
yourself for a very messy trial.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.761
I can't. I just can't.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.930
RYAN:
As I was pulling out,
I saw Cannon and Naomi.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.264
Ryan, you have to come forward.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.642
You could help
make her case.

01:07.150 --> 01:11.279
I could watch you
sleep all day.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.781
(chuckles)

01:12.823 --> 01:14.825
What are you doing
in my room?

01:14.867 --> 01:16.535
It's my house,
isn't it?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.954
(grunts)

01:18.996 --> 01:21.248
(chuckles)
Ooh, boy, you're cute.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.917
If you weren't an
employee, I would...

01:22.958 --> 01:25.126
Oh, no, don't get dressed.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.962
What do you want, Laura?

01:27.004 --> 01:28.463
You know what I want.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.715
Work-wise.

01:31.341 --> 01:36.471
Laura Mathison fun fact:
I design bags.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.973
Bags?

01:38.015 --> 01:39.098
Mm-hmm. You know,

01:39.140 --> 01:42.061
purses, handbags,
the occasional clutch.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.729
I just started
my own business,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.940
and it is
actually doing

01:45.981 --> 01:47.148
really really well!

01:47.190 --> 01:49.443
So, I'm gonna need you
to take me downtown

01:49.484 --> 01:50.527
to get supplies.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.404
Can't you just
give me a list?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.155
It'll be quicker if I go alone.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.325
Quicker... but way less fun.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.494
I'll meet you outside?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.996
Oh, and it's hot out,

02:01.038 --> 02:03.164
so you don't have
to wear a shirt.

02:09.755 --> 02:10.965
(sighs)

02:19.389 --> 02:22.935
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
My new locker mate!

02:22.977 --> 02:24.394
Finally we meet.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.771
Full disclosure?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.523
I was kind of hoping they'd
keep this locker free.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.484
Yeah, I was thinking about
putting in a mini fridge.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.111
Well, I'm sorry
to crush your dreams.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.528
Nah, it's okay.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.281
I can drink my coconut water
room temperature.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.118
Have we met before?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.119
I don't think so.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.536
I just transferred to West Bev.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.706
Oh, okay. Weird,
'cause you look so familiar.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.207
Well, do I look familiar?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.709
My name's Navid,
by the way.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.336
Navid Shirazi.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.218
What did I say?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.391
(girls speaking low,
indistinctly)

03:14.277 --> 03:16.905
(hoarsely):
Hey, uh, do I sound

03:16.947 --> 03:18.281
like I have laryngitis

03:18.323 --> 03:19.741
and that I should rest
my voice instead

03:19.783 --> 03:20.909
of doing my history
presentation?

03:20.951 --> 03:22.243
No.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.411
(normal voice)
Well, damn.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.872
Do you have a extra history
presentation?

03:26.498 --> 03:28.083
What's up with them?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.084
(girls chuckling)

03:29.126 --> 03:31.712
It's probably that stupid rumor.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.254
What rumor?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.008
You know the girl Parker, right?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.425
She was just running her mouth.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.260
About what?

03:39.302 --> 03:42.430
Well, she said
you guys hooked up

03:42.472 --> 03:46.185
and that you were shooting pool
with a rope. Ha!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.104
Unbelievable, man.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.898
She's just pissed
'cause I rejected her.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.315
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I figured.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.567
I'm not interested
in screwing around.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.860
I want to be with Silver.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.277
Things were good with us,
you know? We were good.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.739
I need to get her back.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.575
Yeah. Yeah, well,
I hear you buddy.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.578
(hoarsely):
Maybe you should talk to her.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.371
(normal voice)
Sound any better? No?

04:07.497 --> 04:09.249
All right, man.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.333
Later.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.089
"Torch."

04:16.130 --> 04:17.216
"Loo."

04:17.257 --> 04:18.257
"Lift."

04:18.298 --> 04:20.886
I just love
the way you talk.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.138
You make English sound so...

04:23.180 --> 04:24.598
English?

04:24.639 --> 04:25.849
Exactly!

04:27.267 --> 04:28.643
So are you from London or what?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.187
Not far.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.230
Let's say

04:31.271 --> 04:32.522
London is here.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.067
Now, to get to my
little hamlet,

04:35.109 --> 04:36.484
you'd have to
travel east...

04:36.526 --> 04:38.445
just a bit.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.447
And then it ticks south.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.866
What the hell are you
still doing here?!

04:43.784 --> 04:44.785
I think she means me.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.994
More cartography later.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.163
Stay away from him,
he's a psychopath!

04:48.205 --> 04:50.165
Ivy, come now.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.499
Seriously, why don't you just...

04:51.541 --> 04:53.501
God, why don't you
just go home?!

04:53.543 --> 04:55.087
Got to finish my PG year.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.508
Wow. So you're staying?

05:00.550 --> 05:01.843
I am.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.595
Look, I understand
you're upset,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.472
but your mum had it coming.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.432
She destroyed my family.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.517
And you were just...

05:11.061 --> 05:13.521
...collateral damage.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.858
You are a repulsive human being.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.694
We'll agree to disagree.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.697
Whatever.
Just stay the hell away from me!

05:25.200 --> 05:26.827
I just don't get it.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.536
Why does my locker neighbor
hate me?

05:28.578 --> 05:29.871
You think I was
acting all cocky

05:29.913 --> 05:31.123
because I'm a big,
cool senior now?

05:31.165 --> 05:35.043
Don't worry.
You're not that cool.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.878
Maybe she was weirded out
by the straightening iron

05:36.920 --> 05:38.337
you keep in your locker.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.007
You guys don't understand the
threat of a Persian curl.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.883
Did you tell her
any of your dumb jokes?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.052
Dude, I don't tell
any dumb jokes!

05:44.094 --> 05:46.013
DIXON:
Are you serious?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.889
How do you get
a Kleenex to dance?

05:47.931 --> 05:49.057
Put a little boogie in it!

05:51.268 --> 05:53.770
Dude, that's legitimately funny!

05:55.105 --> 05:56.231
Oh, hey, Navid.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.399
Hey, Harper.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.235
Just dropping off the yearbook
DVDs for dubbing.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.402
Yeah, it's fine
with me.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.364
So, I hear we're running
neck and neck

06:05.406 --> 06:06.741
for the Leadership Award.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.367
Yeah? That so?
Yes, it is.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.037
Of course,
the fact that I was

06:10.078 --> 06:11.746
the one who lobbied to
have the Senior Achievement

06:11.788 --> 06:13.665
Awards Ceremony moved
to the beginning of the year

06:13.707 --> 06:15.167
in the first place
should place my neck

06:15.209 --> 06:16.710
slightly ahead
of your neck.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.545
I mean, what's the point of
winning the Leadership Award

06:18.586 --> 06:20.255
if I can't put it on
my college application?

06:20.297 --> 06:22.257
You know, I might actually win,
Harper.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.842
I know you might.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.093
Hey, don't be so cocky, okay?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.594
I'm the one
who resurrected the Blaze.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.263
Well, I'm editor
of the yearbook.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.265
Well, I got Key Club.
And I still maintain that you

06:30.307 --> 06:31.725
stuffed those ballot boxes!
I did what?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.727
All right, you two,
let's take it down a notch.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.272
Yeah. Um, look, you know what
you both need?

06:37.314 --> 06:40.775
You guys just need to ditch
the Achievement Awards

06:40.817 --> 06:42.610
and head on over to the Undies.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.280
The Underachievement Awards?
Really?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.615
Is that joke of a ceremony
still going on?

06:47.657 --> 06:49.243
It sure is.
And actually, I hear

06:49.284 --> 06:51.536
they have a hell
of a DJ this year.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.537
Who is it...?

06:52.579 --> 06:53.872
Oh, yeah, that's right, it's me.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.750
Who in their right mind
actually wants

06:56.791 --> 06:58.001
to celebrate
underachievement?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.713
Navid, I'll see you tomorrow
night.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.759
All kidding aside,
may the best person win.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.469
Psych!

07:08.511 --> 07:10.097
Handshake denied.
(chuckles)

07:16.519 --> 07:18.563
There are no words.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.899
(Dixon whistles)

07:25.362 --> 07:27.322
Yeah, I mean, I'll do
whatever it takes, you know?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.074
I'll sign statements,
I'll testify.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.744
I'll do whatever you want,
whatever you need.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.292
What?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.834
Look, I'd love to tell you

07:39.876 --> 07:41.295
that this new information solves
everything,

07:41.336 --> 07:44.381
but all it really does is place
you and Cannon at the school

07:44.423 --> 07:46.133
on the night
of the alleged assault.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.884
And frankly,
the fact that you were drunk

07:47.926 --> 07:49.469
hurts your credibility.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.553
Sorry.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.681
So what does this mean?

07:53.723 --> 07:54.975
Bottom line?

07:55.016 --> 07:58.103
It's still your word
against Cannon's.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.148
But I still believe you should
come forward.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.358
Right, a slutty teenage girl
who wears short skirts

08:03.400 --> 08:06.194
and has a history of lying
versus an Oxford-wearing

08:06.236 --> 08:07.946
Oxford scholar
with a fancy accent.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.949
That sounds like a fair fight.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.284
Well, if you want
a schoolteacher

08:12.326 --> 08:14.119
who has been known
to drink too much

08:14.161 --> 08:15.745
and destroy school property
on your side...

08:17.414 --> 08:22.043
Um, look, it may not be
a fair fight,

08:22.085 --> 08:24.296
but it's a fight worth fighting.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.214
And you're not alone, Naomi.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.767
Okay.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.186
Let's do it.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.563
Let's press charges.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.716
Just please sign the attendance
book for me, okay?

09:09.757 --> 09:11.885
I promise I had a valid reason
for missing school.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.304
Uh-huh. And what's the reason?

09:14.346 --> 09:18.016
I was doing something personal
that I'd rather not discuss.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.185
Please, you're just gonna have
to trust me.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.062
You'll forgive me if I don't.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.357
Oh, my God, don't make me make
someone fire you!

09:25.399 --> 09:28.068
Don't make me mention this
to Principal Nowack.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.820
Just sign the book!

09:30.862 --> 09:33.614
You can use my pen, which, BTW,
is worth more than your car.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.951
Sign the book.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.497
Hey, Mrs. List, Principal Nowack
wanted to see me. Naomi.

09:41.789 --> 09:45.085
Um, attendance.
Yeah, I meant to tell you

09:45.126 --> 09:46.836
that Naomi's absence
yesterday was excused.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.886
What the hell are you
looking at?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.013
A vision.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.270
What a bitch.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.772
I know.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.276
Hey. Uh,

10:09.317 --> 10:11.778
you seemed upset when I said
you look familiar.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.946
Maybe I was a jerk

10:12.987 --> 10:14.531
when we crossed paths
or something.

10:14.573 --> 10:17.242
Sometimes I jerk out,
but never on purpose.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.410
Very funny.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.619
Excuse me?

10:19.660 --> 10:22.205
Look, I know exactly
how you know me,

10:22.247 --> 10:24.416
and you know exactly
how you know me.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.251
So since we both know
exactly what's going on,

10:26.293 --> 10:28.878
we really don't need to talk
about it, do we?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.309
Hey, Silver.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.477
Hey.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.103
Come on.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.646
What?

10:46.687 --> 10:48.607
I miss you.
And I know you're pissed,

10:48.648 --> 10:49.857
but you gotta give me
a chance

10:49.899 --> 10:51.526
to make things up
to you.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.652
I don't gotta
do anything.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.988
But I love you.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.615
We were good together.
At least let me

10:56.656 --> 10:57.740
come with you to the
Achievement Awards tonight,

10:57.782 --> 10:58.825
show my support.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.994
Why, is Parker busy?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.330
L-Look, whatever you heard...

11:03.371 --> 11:05.081
Doesn't matter what I heard.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.749
I shouldn't have even
brought it up.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.251
This isn't
about Parker.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.211
We're not getting back together.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.214
You need to move on.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.679
No, no, no.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.557
It's not that your segment on
secret piercings isn't good...

11:22.599 --> 11:24.225
Yeah, it's really
friggin' good.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.602
Right. Fine.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.020
But we have to follow
FCC guidelines.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.021
And school
guidelines.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.607
So we can't
actually show, uh...

11:30.649 --> 11:33.026
genitals on the Blaze.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.444

11:34.486 --> 11:36.196

Uh, can we talk

11:43.244 --> 11:45.288

11:49.334 --> 11:50.377

11:50.418 --> 11:51.545
thank you so much.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.629

11:52.671 --> 11:57.300
Long, uncomfortable, uh,
graphic story.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.303
Uh... I'll tell you
later tonight.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.888
Right. About that.

12:01.929 --> 12:02.889
Uh-oh.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.391
I'm really sorry, Navid.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.059
I wanted to be
at the Achievement Awards.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.436
It's just, some studio time
opened up.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.063
No, say no more.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.191
I'm just, uh, I'm just glad
you're still recording.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.359
Victor decided

12:14.401 --> 12:15.569
not to expose you, huh?

12:15.610 --> 12:17.070
Smart man.
He's probably afraid

12:17.111 --> 12:19.573
the wrath of Navid
would rain down on him.

12:19.614 --> 12:23.159
Actually...
I didn't dump Victor.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.245
What?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.996
I decided not to.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.039
Ade, why?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.083
He's done some really big things

12:30.124 --> 12:31.251
for my career.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.336
The picture I took--

12:33.378 --> 12:35.338
it's gonna be the cover
of a national magazine.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.257
Great.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.092
The cover, Navid!

12:39.133 --> 12:41.052
That's a huge deal.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
It's right there, you know?

12:43.137 --> 12:46.266
Everything I've dreamed of,
it's-it's all happening.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.395
And if he tells what he knows,
it'll all go away.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.230
Temporarily, but you'll
get it all back,

12:52.272 --> 12:53.398
and on your terms.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.567
You don't know that.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.902
It's just not worth the risk,
not when I'm this close.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.030
And besides, it's still
my voice singing the songs.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.990
Lots of people don't write
their own music, right?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.492
Sure. Gotcha.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.120
Um, listen, I got to send
this last Blaze edition out.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.787
I'll talk to you later, okay?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.373
Yeah.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.750
Okay.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.134
Hey, so guess what?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.801
The police told the school
about the investigation

13:22.843 --> 13:23.970
and Cannon
got suspended.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.888
Hey, that's great.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.056
What-what's going on?

13:29.183 --> 13:30.435
I got suspended, too.

Oh, Mr. Matthews.
No, it's okay.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.649
I, uh, I knew this would happen
when I agreed to come forward.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.151
And, uh... I don't regret it.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.736
Not at all.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.782
Seriously, don't give it
another thought.

I do than I have ever done."

it'll be mine.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.947
Well, we'll see about that,

14:24.989 --> 14:26.574

14:46.720 --> 14:48.513
Yeah, bit of

Englishman roaming the halls.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.939
Actually, I'm, uh, I'm taking
a leave of absence.

excuse me.

there, right?

29:35.649 --> 29:37.192
With what?

29:37.234 --> 29:39.319
Why would you take yourself
out of the running

29:39.361 --> 29:41.029
for the Leadership Award?

29:41.071 --> 29:43.823
Uh... Well, I realized

29:43.865 --> 29:45.492
that Harper deserved it
more than I did.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.786
Anyways, we're late

29:47.827 --> 29:49.288
for a thing.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.456
Have a good night, Ms. Nowack.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.665
And, uh,

29:51.707 --> 29:52.708
thanks for the chicken.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.543
Good night.

29:54.585 --> 29:55.961
Navid...

29:56.002 --> 29:58.297
So who do you think,
uh, cleaned up the Undies?

29:58.338 --> 29:59.965
You thought she deserved it,
seriously?

30:00.006 --> 30:01.634
Well, yeah. She's in
charge of yearbook,

30:01.675 --> 30:02.842
she's on student government.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.137
She did move up the ceremony
so we could use it

30:05.178 --> 30:07.765
on our college apps.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.808
And after hearing
her dad lay into her,

30:09.849 --> 30:11.851
you felt bad.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.481
Well, I have a lot, you know.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.817
Great family, great friends,
great looks.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.277
(both chuckle)

30:20.319 --> 30:24.573
Nah, I have enough.
I don't need any award.

30:24.615 --> 30:27.743
You're a good guy,
you know that?

30:27.785 --> 30:29.328
Yeah, whatever.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.496
No, not whatever.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.205
Seriously good.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.754
Wait, is "seriously good"
proper English?

30:38.796 --> 30:40.506
Shut up.
I'm just saying.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.549
The Achievement Award
hasn't been engraved yet.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.092

30:44.134 --> 30:47.513
Among us losers,
there are winners.

If you won an Undies Award
tonight,

please raise it proudly
in the air. Yes.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.019
Air that dirty laundry, people.

30:55.729 --> 30:58.315
You know, those other kids

they may have brains and drive

31:01.067 --> 31:02.277
and ambition,

31:02.319 --> 31:04.488
but at the end of the day,

31:04.530 --> 31:05.656
we'll get farther in life,

31:05.698 --> 31:07.533
because we're hotter

but I don't think anybody's
going to steal these.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.973
Yeah, no kidding.

She's having some kind

What the hell
is a purse emergency?

33:23.543 --> 33:26.338
(sighs)
This is taking a while.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.131
I think it's a good sign.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.259
Thanks.

33:31.301 --> 33:34.220
For your help.

No thanks necessary.

Dinner will suffice.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.099
Still not going to happen.

33:38.141 --> 33:41.770
But you can have my pen
as a consolation prize.

33:44.523 --> 33:48.861
I'm going to use this to sign
our marriage license someday.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.278
Uh-huh.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.532
I've got good news, finally.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.867
Turns out you were right.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.786
Mr. Cannon is Mr. Atherton,

33:57.828 --> 33:59.204
and he's wanted
in the U.K.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.372
Oh, my God.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.999
That's great.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.542
Um... what happens now?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.711
Now we put his extradition
paperwork into motion,

34:05.752 --> 34:08.213
and we arrest
the son of a bitch.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.056
Officer, I'm so sorry.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.933
I was just in such a hurry.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.143
I know I was speeding, but...

34:22.185 --> 34:24.813
is there any way I can dance
my way out of this ticket?

34:33.864 --> 34:36.199
Is that the same person?

34:37.367 --> 34:38.994
Yeah.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.286
Looks like the
same girl to me.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.621
I knew it.
I knew I recognized her.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.623
Well, congratulations.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.083
You're a true
porn connoisseur.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.668
No. It was a long summer.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.170
Ade was out of town,

34:49.212 --> 34:50.964
so yeah, I snuck
into my dad's office

34:51.005 --> 34:52.591
and uploaded a few movies.
No explanation necessary.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.009
It's okay.

34:54.051 --> 34:56.887
No, it's not okay, Silver.

34:56.929 --> 35:00.181
Don't you get it? That girl
Kaitlyn is a junior.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.683
Which means my dad put an
underage girl in his movie.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.358
What?

35:10.400 --> 35:11.359
LAURA:
Bullcrap.

35:11.401 --> 35:14.195
We agreed to $3,000,
not $2,000.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.031
How do we know
about the quality?

35:16.073 --> 35:17.365
It's good, I swear.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.700
Who are these guys?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.118
We're customers.

35:20.159 --> 35:23.538
Customers that are
trying to stiff me.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.792
Ten purses, three grand,
that's the price.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.627
Maybe we won't pay the price.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.836
Well, you have to.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.463
LIAM:
Okay, everybody,
let's calm down.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.381
We're talking about purses here.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.842
No, I don't think
it's worth $3,000.

35:35.884 --> 35:36.802
Nah.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.933
LIAM:
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell, man?

35:58.448 --> 36:00.075
Not bad.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.077
No kidding.

36:03.954 --> 36:07.373
So... three grand?

36:17.300 --> 36:20.595
I-I'm just saying,
I think you were robbed.

36:20.637 --> 36:23.306
All right? I think you have way
less school spirit than Liam.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.892
I mean, do you even know
what the school mascot is?

36:25.934 --> 36:28.436
Yes. It's that stupid cat.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.438
See? See, I wish the voters
would've heard that.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.357
Come here.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.282
Now, look, um...

36:41.324 --> 36:44.410
I don't want to pressure you
into anything, all right?

36:44.452 --> 36:46.454
And you know, if-if you're
not into it, just say,

36:46.496 --> 36:48.540
"Dixon, back off," and
I'll back off, all right?

36:48.581 --> 36:50.959
What?

36:52.335 --> 36:54.963
Well, before everything
happened with Sasha,

36:55.005 --> 36:59.384
I was going to come over,
and we were going to...

36:59.425 --> 37:00.385
You know.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.302
Right.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.017
I'm-I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have...

37:07.059 --> 37:08.810
No, it's cool.
No, no, no, no. No.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.854
It's not, I-I...

37:10.896 --> 37:12.105
(sighs)
I was being a jerk.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.649
You know, we got
to build up trust again.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.484
And you know,
I lied to you,

37:16.526 --> 37:18.820
and you've always been
honest with me.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.363
Dixon...

37:20.405 --> 37:22.240
Look, I don't want to
rush things, all right?

37:22.281 --> 37:26.912
Your first time, it's...
it's got to be right, so...

37:26.953 --> 37:28.830
we could take as
long as you want.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.711
Dixon, when you broke up
with me,

37:34.753 --> 37:37.505
I just felt so, so rejected...

37:37.547 --> 37:38.840
Baby, I know, I know...

37:38.882 --> 37:40.717
Look, look, will you
let me finish?

37:42.552 --> 37:45.597
I felt so rejected,

37:45.638 --> 37:47.515
and I-I went home...

37:50.977 --> 37:52.104
And Oscar was there...

38:01.905 --> 38:03.198
And I slept with him.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.025
Dude, dude,
slow down, all right?

38:39.067 --> 38:40.068
We're not in a rush.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.278
Yeah, I don't want to die.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.739
I mean... I kinda do, but...

38:44.781 --> 38:46.074
(car horns honking)
Whoa!
Hey!

38:46.116 --> 38:47.242
What the hell, man?

38:47.284 --> 38:48.243
(clears throat)
Sorry.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.161
Sorry.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.246
Are you okay?

38:51.288 --> 38:53.581
You didn't drink
before this, did you?

38:53.623 --> 38:54.666
No.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.420
Fine, whatever.
I smoked a little weed.

39:00.797 --> 39:01.923
What?

39:01.965 --> 39:04.217
Relax. Like an hour ago,
all right?

39:04.259 --> 39:05.551
I'm totally cool now.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.761
Pull over.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.638
I'm fine.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.598
Pull over! Right now!

39:10.640 --> 39:12.600
NAVID:
Dude, I'm not kidding,
seriously,

39:12.642 --> 39:14.019
stop the car.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.780
NAVID:
You could've killed us, man.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.115
What is wrong with you?

39:27.157 --> 39:28.783
Calm down!

39:28.825 --> 39:30.160
No. What the hell is

39:30.202 --> 39:31.703
Nothing.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.332
Hey, where you going?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.791
I'm going to walk.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.126
Why?

39:38.168 --> 39:41.171
Just leave me alone, okay?

39:41.213 --> 39:43.089
I just want to be left alone.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.306
I cannot wait to see
the look on his face.

39:51.348 --> 39:52.640
Are you guys sure
we should be here?

39:52.682 --> 39:54.309
Hell, yeah.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.977
I'm getting a shot
of this jerk in handcuffs,

39:56.019 --> 39:58.813
for YouTube.

39:58.855 --> 39:59.772
What's taking so long?

39:59.814 --> 40:01.316
Maybe he's resisting arrest

40:01.358 --> 40:02.901
and they're beating
the crap out of him.

40:09.782 --> 40:10.658
Wait...

40:12.869 --> 40:14.246
Where is he?

40:16.248 --> 40:18.583
Naomi, you shouldn't be here.

40:18.624 --> 40:19.667
This is police business.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.127
Well, where is he?
He's not here?

40:21.169 --> 40:22.545
He fled.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.881
He packed up everything.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.299
The place is totally
cleaned out.

40:26.341 --> 40:27.759
I guess he knew
something was up.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.969
So he-he could be anywhere.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.470
We have an APB
out on him.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.724
If he pops up anywhere near
here, he'll be arrested.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.605
He's gone? He's...

40:40.646 --> 40:42.648
Naomi.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.649
It's over.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.611
You don't have to
see him ever again.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.529
It's over.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.991
He's gone.
