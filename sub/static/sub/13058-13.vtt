00:02.770 --> 00:05.437
Provenza: We may not have
been able to connect him

00:05.439 --> 00:08.374
to the courtroom massacre yet,

00:08.376 --> 00:11.577
but we've arrested his
10 Little Nazi conspirators,

00:11.579 --> 00:13.679
connected them to
the poisoned Thai food,

00:13.681 --> 00:16.548
and you know, Captain,
one of these guys will crack.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.649
They always do.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.618
And when that happens,
we'll get Graff.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.321
Well, Graff may have been
involved in the death

00:22.323 --> 00:24.723
of our court clerk, Hai Sun,
but I'm finding it

00:24.725 --> 00:27.326
difficult to believe
that he would help Dwight

00:27.328 --> 00:28.460
shoot up a courtroom.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.962
What did he get
out of that?

00:29.964 --> 00:33.665
The entire L.A.P.D. hopping up
and down on his gang, ma'am.

00:33.667 --> 00:37.703
By comparison,
this conspiracy to kill Hai Sun

00:37.705 --> 00:38.971
was simple-minded.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.406
Ridiculous, even.

00:40.408 --> 00:45.177
But Dwight's murders were
intelligently designed.

00:46.814 --> 00:51.583
Not only to conceal information.

00:51.585 --> 00:56.388
But also to eliminate
loose ends.

00:56.390 --> 01:01.393
And to stop a prosecutor who was
close to uncovering the truth.

01:02.329 --> 01:05.197
All very deliberate.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.435
Except for the murder
of Marco Calderon,

01:09.437 --> 01:11.570
his court-appointed attorney.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.604
And Taylor.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.840
No. Taylor was
shooting at Dwight,

01:14.842 --> 01:16.775
who only returned fire, sir.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.445
But Calderon.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.580
Well, maybe Dwight
just hated Calderon.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.183
He yelled at him when
we were in court, ma'am.

01:24.185 --> 01:27.619
What if Calderon
was targeted, too?

01:27.621 --> 01:31.457
Marco Calderon is
the only outside person

01:31.459 --> 01:35.260
besides Simms who had
regular contact with Dwight.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.196
[ Clears throat ]
Uh, Detective Sanchez,

01:37.198 --> 01:38.831
do you have a second?

01:38.833 --> 01:40.332
Oh. Sure.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.268
Uh, excuse me, Captain,
Lieutenant.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.974
So, Calderon might have been
one of the loose ends.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.909
Do you believe
there are more?

01:50.911 --> 01:52.411
Yes, I do.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.347
A loose end we haven't
considered until now.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.816
And one that is staring us

01:57.818 --> 02:00.652
straight in the face.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.631
We found
Mark's grandparents.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.801
They live in Calabasas
and want to take custody of him.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.402
Are you sure?

02:17.404 --> 02:19.438
We're testing their DNA
and running it against Mark's,

02:19.440 --> 02:20.839
but it seems like it --

02:20.841 --> 02:22.975
Okay, where the hell have
they been his whole life?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.543
His grandparents.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.145
They lost track
of their daughter

02:26.147 --> 02:27.346
when she ran away from home

02:27.348 --> 02:28.947
and started hanging out
with Aryans.

02:28.949 --> 02:32.584
God. Right.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.319
Mark.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.990
He just lost his mother,
and he really depends on me.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.459
Look. We --

02:40.461 --> 02:43.061
Mark has his own room
in our house, and, uh...

02:43.063 --> 02:44.329
I just got him a bike helmet

02:44.331 --> 02:45.898
so he can ride
my old bike, and...

02:45.900 --> 02:48.367
We're catching him up
on his math and his spelling

02:48.369 --> 02:49.601
so that he won't be behind.

was only an emergency placement

the boy's family.

You could bring Mark
to work with you tomorrow.

you're ready to say goodbye.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.427
Dwight talks to Dr. Joe
and says his father's alive

03:48.429 --> 03:50.929
right when he gets a new
court-appointed attorney.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.432
Calderon would have also
received a copy of Dr. Joe's

03:53.434 --> 03:55.500
confidential notes
on Dwight's evaluation.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.736
Well, Amy, Julio, and I can do
a LexisNexis search

03:57.738 --> 03:59.838
on Calderon's clients
and see if there's an overlap

03:59.840 --> 04:01.139
with our case.
Good.

their development plans at noon,

assuming various
hair-loss patterns

10:01.168 --> 10:02.934
and different levels
of weight gain.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.803
And this is the only guy
that popped up

10:04.805 --> 10:06.204
with the name "Bill Jones."

10:06.206 --> 10:07.973
Popped up where?

10:07.975 --> 10:08.773
Facebook.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.709
Oh. The Facebook.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.777
His page is private,
and all I know is that

10:12.779 --> 10:14.546
in his profile picture,
he's standing at

10:14.548 --> 10:17.282
Griffith Observatory holding
hands with a kid I can't see.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.152
And the background photo looks
like a used car dealership.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.320
Ah, a used car dealer.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.223
So he never really
gave up the criminal life.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.526
But if we could I.D. that
dealership and we find him,

10:28.528 --> 10:31.029
do you guys have enough
to ask him here for a meeting?

10:31.031 --> 10:34.232
No. If we ask him here,
he'll just disappear.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.235
We need to see if his prints
match the William Jones

10:37.237 --> 10:39.137
I found in
Hecht's high school annual.

10:39.139 --> 10:43.608
Yeah. Oh. Looks like
we're back to Dwight Darnell.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.176
Uh, we'll
pick this up later.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.679
Let me think of a way to hunt
for this William Jones.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.147
We're very close, though.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.017
Very, very close.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.671
I'm not comfortable charging
Graff with murder or conspiracy

11:12.673 --> 11:14.172
just on this statement.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.775
I agree, although it does
give us a lot of information

11:16.777 --> 11:19.944
on the Z's illegal drug
and weapons trade.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.413
We corroborate what
Patrick told us,

11:21.415 --> 11:23.248
and the Z Brotherhood
is out of business.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.418
And that is another loose
connection severed.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.253
Provenza: The Z Brotherhood
a loose connection?

11:28.255 --> 11:30.321
I thought they were
behind this conspiracy.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.290
Well, you said so yourself,
Lieutenant,

11:32.292 --> 11:35.593
that there are easier ways
to have Dr. Joe killed

11:35.595 --> 11:37.729
than shooting him
on the stand.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.564
That's what that idiot
Patrick just said.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.933
How stupid it was for the Zs
to shoot up the courtroom.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.368
What does it get them?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.637
Well, they got the entire
L.A.P.D. on their backs.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.238
Hobbs:
Their property was condemned.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.307
We have a guide to their drug-
and gun-running operation.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.377
But who was trying to
put the Zs out of business?

11:52.379 --> 11:56.548
Someone who decided
the Zs were a liability,

11:56.550 --> 11:58.183
someone who had a lot to lose,

11:58.185 --> 12:01.853
someone who was hopefully
connected to Marco Calderon.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.121
Where are we with that?

12:03.123 --> 12:04.856
Well, Dwight bumped
his first

12:04.858 --> 12:07.225
court-appointed attorney,
and Calderon showed up

12:07.227 --> 12:09.527
to advise him
almost immediately, ma'am.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.829
Volunteered.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.931
Oh, out of the goodness
of his heart?

12:12.933 --> 12:15.600
Calderon mostly represented
white-collar criminals,

12:15.602 --> 12:18.403
but according to LexisNexis,
he also took on about

12:18.405 --> 12:20.905
five or six
pro bono cases a year.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.575
All for truck drivers who
couldn't afford an attorney.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.310
Here's
a couple of examples.

12:25.312 --> 12:29.080
Carl Kubiak was arrested
for smuggling firearms.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.082
Calderon argued that
it was an illegal search.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.917
Got the case dismissed, ma'am.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.787
And another trucker,
Mike Walton -- arrested by CHP

12:35.789 --> 12:38.223
in Chatsworth for hiding
ephedrine in his cargo.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.991
Again, thrown out
as an illegal search.

12:39.993 --> 12:43.361
So Calderon had
a history of saving people

12:43.363 --> 12:45.630
illegally trafficking
drugs and weapons.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.800
Yeah, which proves a connection
to the Z Brotherhood.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.068
But Dwight?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.636
Sykes: It does connect
to Dwight because

12:51.638 --> 12:54.773
all the drivers Calderon repped
worked for the same company --

12:54.775 --> 12:56.007
Bullhood Trucking.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.776
And this is important
because...?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.778
Because for the past
18 years,

12:59.780 --> 13:02.046
Bullhood's
Board of Directors included

13:02.048 --> 13:04.015
Dwight's mother,
Wildred Darnell,

13:04.017 --> 13:06.951
and its
Chief of Operations...

13:06.953 --> 13:08.820
Jordan Graff.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.488
Who replaced
the old Z shot-caller,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.557
Brian Schultz, when
he died two years ago.

13:12.559 --> 13:16.261
Wildred Darnell knows both of
them, and she lied about that.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.863
Maybe she taught her son
to be an Aryan, too.

13:18.865 --> 13:22.167
Hobbs: I think we should see
exactly what routes

13:22.169 --> 13:24.803
Bullhood Trucking drives
and through what cities.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.938
And whose cargo
they're transporting

13:26.940 --> 13:28.706
between Los Angeles and Mexico.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.275
Lieutenant Tao's
on it right now.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.278
Buzz, would you call up
the video of the interviews

13:33.280 --> 13:35.547
between Marco Calderon
and Dwight

13:35.549 --> 13:36.815
when he was in County?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.183
There won't
be any sound.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.319
That's okay.
I need to take a look at them.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.223
Okay, so these are
Bullhood's regular routes.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.526
I also have their manifests,
inventories, bank finances.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.128
Where'd you get all
this data from, Mike?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.730
When I ran the company,
the FBI already had

13:52.732 --> 13:55.166
an open investigation
on Bullhood,

13:55.168 --> 13:58.169
which despite its name,
is a company owned in Panama

13:58.171 --> 14:01.139
and licensed to operate
in Mexico and the U.S.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.274
It would have taken us months
to track down its owners

14:03.276 --> 14:04.909
and its Board of Directors.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.378
That's just what you would want
if you were smuggling guns

14:07.380 --> 14:08.513
to Mexico.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.081
Or distributing meth

14:10.083 --> 14:12.350
all across
the Southwestern U.S.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.054
The main cities Bullhood
services are the ones

14:16.056 --> 14:18.556
Patrick listed as
Z's distribution centers.

14:18.558 --> 14:22.160
But Bullhood must carry
some kind of legal cargo.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.430
Tao: UV glass and lumber
to Mexico, solar panels,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.966
green building materials,
and cement coming back.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.835
But employees
of all different races.

14:30.837 --> 14:34.072
The on-the-record overlap
with Z is specifically limited

14:34.074 --> 14:36.975
to Jordan Graff, and during
the 16 years before him,

14:36.977 --> 14:39.110
Brian Schultz.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.445
Andrea,
what do you think?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.780
Patrick's statement
gives us probable cause.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.884
You could get a search warrant
for every Bullhood vehicle

14:45.886 --> 14:47.218
currently on the road.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.888
Andy, can you coordinate
that operation with CHP?

14:49.890 --> 14:54.492
It may take a few hours to get
started, but by tonight...

14:54.494 --> 14:55.860
Captain.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.428
We have a video
of Dwight and Marco's

14:57.430 --> 14:59.063
visitation,
which I've forwarded.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.331
If I could pull it up?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.566
Be my guest.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.002
I found something
that might be interesting.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.804
Ye Gods.
All these screens.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.107
Here we go.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.617
So that continues
for a while.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.353
And then...

15:31.231 --> 15:35.099
So, Marco gives Dwight
some bad news,

15:35.101 --> 15:37.568
news that upset him,
and then Marco calms him down.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.636
How is that?

15:38.638 --> 15:40.705
Well, it would be
great to ask them.

15:40.707 --> 15:45.276
Or maybe Simms, who was there,
even if he was out of earshot.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.179
But of course we can't
because they're dead.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.682
Tao: But it could be
Calderon passed along an order

15:50.684 --> 15:53.384
that Dwight didn't like,
then told him where it came from

15:53.386 --> 15:54.819
and got him more interested.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.221
And for once,
it was a conversation

15:57.223 --> 15:59.958
that Simms was
not allowed to hear.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.427
Are you suggesting
Simms told Dwight

16:02.429 --> 16:05.196
to kill Calderon and then
Calderon comes along and says,

16:05.198 --> 16:06.497
"Hey, you have to
kill Simms?"

16:06.499 --> 16:08.166
Well, it could have
happened like that

16:08.168 --> 16:11.202
if Dwight trusted
Calderon's source.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.672
But who was that source?

16:14.674 --> 16:18.576
Who would have profited
from all of this?

16:20.747 --> 16:25.550
We have an interim report.
So far, three of Bullhood trucks

16:25.552 --> 16:28.553
had disassembled M-4s
hidden in the lumber,

16:28.555 --> 16:31.055
and two were caught
coming back from Tijuana

16:31.057 --> 16:32.857
with ephedrine
in cement bags.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.225
Good.
So now we've got

16:34.227 --> 16:36.027
enough evidence
to charge Graff with murder,

16:36.029 --> 16:38.429
smuggling firearms,
drug distribution.

16:38.431 --> 16:42.767
So, the drivers of Bullhood's
trucks will need legal counsel,

16:42.769 --> 16:45.503
and Marco Calderon
is no longer available.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.338
Enter Jordan Graff.
Mm-hmm.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.208
You know, for someone
who worked Internal Affairs

16:50.210 --> 16:52.043
most of her career,

16:52.045 --> 16:55.113
[ Door opens ]
you're really sneaky.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.514
[ Door closes ]

16:56.516 --> 16:57.715
Oh, uh...

16:57.717 --> 16:59.417
I didn't realize
you guys would still be up.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.918
What's that
behind your back?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.487
Um...

17:02.489 --> 17:05.890
Well, look.
You guys were all so busy.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.659
I figured out a way
to identify the Bill Jones

17:08.661 --> 17:11.062
that Buzz located online as --
Whoa.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.430
Nice move, kid.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.298
It's not a nice move,
Andy.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.068
Rusty Thomas Beck,
you are not supposed to be

17:17.070 --> 17:19.837
following around
murder suspects.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.339
I didn't follow him.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.975
I found out what
car dealership he worked at,

17:23.977 --> 17:26.044
and he tried to sell me
a used car.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.279
Or, in his words,
"A pre-owned Mustang."

17:28.281 --> 17:31.382
And then I asked him
for a bottle of water,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.751
and he gave it to me.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.520
Plus his business card.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.855
You have to admit,
that's good work.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.224
Rusty's not supposed to be
knowingly putting himself

17:40.226 --> 17:41.459
in harm's way.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.161
I didn't put myself
in harm's way.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.329
I didn't go for a test drive
with him or anything.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.432
I was in public,
surrounded by a lot of people,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.500
and look, if I am gonna
end up being a journalist,

17:49.502 --> 17:50.768
not every single assignment

17:50.770 --> 17:53.704
is gonna be like
an Easter egg hunt.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.513
Okay.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.949
We can use this.

18:04.951 --> 18:10.555
But that is the end of
Rusty Beck, junior detective.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.426
Although, this does
bring us closer

18:15.428 --> 18:20.131
to being able to solve two cases
about fatherless boys.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.544
You know what? I'm gonna go grab
a soda from the break room.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.645
No.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.180
I'll get water, then.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.216
Mark, you can't try
and run away again.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.151
Then I'll just run away
from my grandparents

18:40.153 --> 18:41.219
when you give me up.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.088
I'm not giving you up.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.023
I don't have a choice.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.125
Here.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.594
Why don't you read
"Make Way For Ducklings"

18:49.596 --> 18:51.963
and watch TV over here
for a while?

18:51.965 --> 18:55.433
You can't be where
we're working today, Mark.

18:55.435 --> 18:59.170
Julio, did I
do something wrong?

18:59.172 --> 19:00.671
What did I do wrong?

19:03.243 --> 19:04.709
Nothing.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.777
You didn't do
anything wrong, Mark.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.012
Okay? It's, uh...

19:08.014 --> 19:09.847
It's just the way
the world works.

19:09.849 --> 19:14.185
You're supposed to be
with blood relatives, you know.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.354
Your grandparents.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.989
But I won't like them.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.091
I like you.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.827
Mark, you have to
give them a chance.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.362
Graff: Knock, knock.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.264
I'm here to meet the driver
you arrested last night

19:26.266 --> 19:28.733
on the specious charge
of weapons smuggling.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.734
Where is he?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.502
Hey.
What's the matter?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.004
Do you recognize
that guy?

19:33.006 --> 19:33.804
Yeah.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.740
That's Mr. Graff.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.375
He came to
my Uncle Henry's house

19:37.377 --> 19:38.643
and he yelled at my mom.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.111
Okay, Mark, it's
very important

19:40.113 --> 19:42.713
that you don't tell anyone
else that you know that man.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.148
And I'm gonna
explain to you why.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.083
And you have to listen.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.623
Where's my client?

19:52.625 --> 19:58.496
Well, Mr. Graff, uh,
why don't you join us?

19:58.498 --> 20:01.332
