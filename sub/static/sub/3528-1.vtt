02:54.049 --> 02:56.217
-Sir Thomas.
-Your Grace.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.100
-Your Grace.
-Sir Thomas.

03:04.268 --> 03:08.563
Ambassador Chapuys,
I thought you had abandoned us.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.859
It's true. l did. Or tried to.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.112
In all conscience,
I could never abandon Her Majesty.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.240
She is the most gracious
and wonderful woman in the world.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.784
-And the saddest.
-l agree with you.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.870
So does the emperor.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.247
He has written this letter
of encouragement...

03:26.415 --> 03:30.126
...and support for your efforts
on her behalf.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.922
I beg you not to deliver it to me.

03:35.299 --> 03:38.384
Although I have given sufficient proof
of my loyalty to the king...

03:38.552 --> 03:40.595
...l must do nothing
to provoke suspicion.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.264
Consider the times we live in.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.558
I don't want to be deprived...

03:45.726 --> 03:49.270
...of the liberty which allows me
to speak boldly in private...

03:49.438 --> 03:52.982
...about those matters which concern
your master and the queen.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.652
I understand. You need say no more.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.074
-Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.
-Your Majesty.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.328
Sir Thomas More.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.455
Cromwell.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.626
Sir Thomas.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.461
Your Majesty.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.796
I must tell you,
I have received a petition...

04:15.964 --> 04:18.132
...from the members
of the House of Commons.

04:18.300 --> 04:23.262
Complaining of the cruel behaviour and
abuses of the prelates and the clergy.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.264
Thomas...

04:26.600 --> 04:29.644
...people are asking for freedom
from clerical rule.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.813
Your Majesty knows very well...

04:32.981 --> 04:35.775
...that l have always condemned
the abuses of the clergy...

04:35.943 --> 04:38.819
...when they have been brought
to light. As your chancellor...

04:38.987 --> 04:44.200
...l have worked hard to eliminate them
and purify our Holy Church.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.993
But....

04:47.329 --> 04:48.788
You know where I stand.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.208
You've always known.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.712
I cannot condone
this newfangled vision...

04:56.880 --> 04:59.298
...of private belief
and personal grace.

04:59.466 --> 05:04.553
For me, the Church is the permanent
and living sign of God's presence.

05:04.763 --> 05:09.767
It is a visible, palpable community.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.064
Not just a few brethren
gathered in secret rooms.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.405
Then you will speak against me?

05:25.409 --> 05:28.202
My loyalty and love
for Your Majesty is so great...

05:28.370 --> 05:30.871
...that l will never say a word
against you in public.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.169
So help me God.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.101
All rise for the king!

05:55.731 --> 06:02.611
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.038
My Lords, Your Graces...

06:12.205 --> 06:14.415
...we have come here
to hear your response...

06:14.583 --> 06:17.126
...to the charges and responsibilities
laid against you.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.754
You are charged
with supporting the authority...

06:19.921 --> 06:21.797
...of the late Cardinal Wolsey...

06:21.965 --> 06:26.093
...and the bishop of Rome, against
that of your own king and country.

06:30.474 --> 06:34.643
Some here among you may suppose
I seek personal advantage.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.396
It is not so.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.107
As your king...

06:40.275 --> 06:43.319
...l am commissioned
to restore right order on Earth...

06:43.487 --> 06:44.987
...and assert the immunities...

06:45.155 --> 06:50.284
...and princely liberties
of our realm and crown.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.997
This is my sacred duty...

06:56.291 --> 06:59.126
...sealed before God...

06:59.878 --> 07:03.798
...and by solemn oath
at my coronation.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.512
What is your conclusion,
Archbishop Warham?

07:10.680 --> 07:15.434
Your Majesty, before I deliver it,
I give way to His Grace...

07:15.602 --> 07:19.855
...the most Reverent Bishop Fisher,
the Bishop of Rochester.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.782
My Lords...

07:31.034 --> 07:33.536
...we are asked
to admit His Majesty...

07:33.703 --> 07:37.706
...as supreme head
of the Church in England.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.127
Unfortunately,
we cannot grant this to the king...

07:41.294 --> 07:45.214
...without abandoning our unity
with the see of Rome.

07:47.843 --> 07:51.804
If we are to renounce the unity
of the Christian world...

07:51.972 --> 07:55.391
...and leap out of Peter's ship...

07:55.559 --> 07:58.519
...then we shall be drowned
in the waves of all heresies...

07:58.687 --> 08:01.730
...sects, schisms and divisions.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.817
I say to you...

08:04.985 --> 08:09.029
...that the acceptance of regal
supremacy over our Holy Church...

08:09.197 --> 08:15.744
...would represent a tearing asunder
of the seamless coat of Christ.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.250
Your Grace...

08:22.544 --> 08:24.545
...we will hear your judgement.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.758
I will put this proposal
to convocation...

08:29.926 --> 08:32.928
...that Your Majesty has a new title:

08:33.889 --> 08:38.767
Supreme head of the Church
and clergy of England.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.896
But l add the caveat:

08:42.272 --> 08:46.442
"As far as the law of Christ allows."

08:48.445 --> 08:50.237
A trick.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.741
Those in favour?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.633
Very well.

09:14.387 --> 09:19.266
Whoever remains silent
shall be assumed to agree.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.275
Thank you, Your Grace.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.698
-Cardinal Campeggio.
-Holy Father.

10:18.159 --> 10:22.496
Sit down, Cardinal Campeggio.
I know you are a martyr to gout.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.334
And my feet are killing me too.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.169
What do you want to see me about?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.213
We have received two new letters...

10:31.381 --> 10:33.632
...regarding the King of England's
great matter.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.011
Oh, that again.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.221
What do they say?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.557
Well, the first
is from the king himself...

10:41.725 --> 10:46.020
...urging the curia to make a final and
favourable decision on his annulment...

10:46.187 --> 10:48.022
...for the sake of peace in England.

10:49.858 --> 10:54.028
He uses some intemperate language,
Holiness, complaining that:

10:54.195 --> 10:57.573
"Never was there any prince handled
by a pope...

10:57.741 --> 11:00.075
...as Your Holiness has treated us."

11:00.618 --> 11:04.246
He meant my predecessor and,
frankly, he has a point.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.874
Clement
was a terrible procrastinator.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.045
Although it was very wrong for some
people to dig up his dead body...

11:11.212 --> 11:14.923
...and stab it in the street,
I can well understand their feelings.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.551
He was never popular.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.554
And the second letter?

11:20.722 --> 11:21.930
From the emperor.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.934
On behalf of his aunt, Catherine,
the unhappy queen...

11:26.144 --> 11:30.064
...urging you
to prevent the annulment...

11:30.231 --> 11:33.442
...and excommunicate the king.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.238
It is true we must come
to a judgement.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.950
On the other hand...

11:42.660 --> 11:44.661
...to protect the interests
of the Church...

11:44.829 --> 11:48.290
...we should try not to antagonize
one power above the other.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.959
After all,
they have soldiers and guns...

11:51.127 --> 11:55.089
...whereas we must make do
with beauty and truth.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.301
What of this girl, this putain,
the king's whore?

11:59.803 --> 12:01.595
-Anne Boleyn.
-Yes.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.265
Why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.160
No.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.413
Don't get up.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.837
Stay like that.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.592
You're so very beautiful.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.013
So very desirable.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.811
I have to possess you utterly.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.363
I can't wait.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.574
Oh, my love...

13:04.367 --> 13:09.037
...just a little longer. And then....

13:12.709 --> 13:15.627
I am made head of the Church
of England.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.715
Is it true?

13:22.469 --> 13:26.346
Then l am so glad.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.933
At last you have your right...

13:30.393 --> 13:32.853
...and can do as you will.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.568
I'm going to have Cromwell refurbish
some of the apartments in the Tower.

13:40.361 --> 13:45.908
Every Queen of England stays there
before her coronation.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.135
Papa.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.013
What's wrong?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.182
Don't you want to celebrate?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.100
It's far too early for that.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.103
The bishops
were not really defeated.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.358
By default, they voted to make
the king head of the Church...

14:19.526 --> 14:22.903
...but only as far
as the law of Christ allows.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.032
You don't have to be a lawyer
to know that the law of Christ...

14:27.200 --> 14:29.451
...may be used to invalidate
the vote itself.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.287
Then it was all for nothing.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.499
No.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.960
Not for nothing.

14:38.628 --> 14:42.130
The principle has now been effectively
conceded by most of them.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.342
As George told me, their resistance
and recalcitrance...

14:45.510 --> 14:48.470
...really stem from only one man.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.639
-That bloody Bishop Fisher.
-Fisher.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.648
-Sir.
-Mr. Cranmer.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.651
I'm so sorry to be late, Mr. Cromwell.
It's unforgivable.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.861
Nonsense.
We haven't yet begun to dine.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.655
It's good to see you.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.658
Mr. Boleyn, Mr. Wyatt,
this is Mr. Cranmer.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.870
Mr. Cranmer.
You're a man of the cloth, l believe?

15:14.455 --> 15:16.498
And are you not a poet, Mr. Wyatt?

15:16.666 --> 15:19.960
That's the least of my sins. You may
take my confession after supper.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.588
I wouldn't if I were you.
It'll turn your hair white.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.673
We were discussing,
before you arrived...

15:24.841 --> 15:27.342
...the progress
of the convocation of bishops...

15:27.510 --> 15:30.095
...which was called to decide
upon the king's supremacy.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.724
His Majesty has wisely decided
to appoint George Boleyn here...

15:33.891 --> 15:35.851
...to negotiate with Their Graces.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.894
I find most of them accommodating.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.397
Of course, there are a few stubborn
exceptions.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.609
-Bishop Fisher, l assume?
-Naturally.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.902
May I ask who else?

15:46.362 --> 15:49.197
The archbishop himself, Warham...

15:49.866 --> 15:53.285
...after years of being pliable has
suddenly become rather intransigent.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.496
That's because he's old, consequently
he's closer to his Maker...

15:56.664 --> 15:58.582
...to whom he must explain himself.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.043
I'm sure it will be a simple matter
to explain...

16:01.210 --> 16:03.462
...how he helped liberate
his Church...

16:03.630 --> 16:06.757
...from superstition, religious
falsehoods and clerical greed.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.797
Mr. Roose.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.259
Yes, sir.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.762
A cook...

16:54.138 --> 16:55.972
...by trade.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.476
Yes, sir.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.064
You understand
what's expected of you?

17:06.651 --> 17:09.778
I do. Yes.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.323
This is for your trouble.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.876
If you betray us...

17:26.129 --> 17:30.632
...l will destroy your entire family.

18:23.019 --> 18:27.022
Majesty, this is Mr. Cranmer,
of whom l have often spoken.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.399
It was Cranmer
who first spoke to the fact...

18:29.567 --> 18:34.029
...that your Majesty's great matter was
a theological issue, not a legal one.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.198
Mr. Cranmer.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.454
I have desired to meet you
almost above any person now living.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.873
You are most welcome here at court.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.959
-Majesty, l--
-lt's funny.

18:48.169 --> 18:51.087
Some of the greatest and most
celebrated minds in my kingdom...

18:51.255 --> 18:55.717
...sweated and struggled over an issue
which you, an obscure cleric...

18:55.885 --> 18:59.304
...was able to resolve with perfect
simplicity and a clarity of mind...

18:59.472 --> 19:02.307
...which put them all to shame.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.893
Majesty, I--

19:06.229 --> 19:07.479
I--

19:07.688 --> 19:12.943
Mr. Cranmer, His Majesty has decided
to appoint you his personal chaplain.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.822
I--

19:19.784 --> 19:21.451
You must thank His Majesty.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.829
Of course.

19:24.747 --> 19:25.956
Majesty.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.961
You are welcome here, Mr. Cranmer.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.631
-Mr. Cromwell.
-Majesty.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.513
Well done, Mr. Cranmer, well done.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.268
So you married your ward.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.853
What's her name?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.231
-Catherine Brook.
-Catherine.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.233
Why her?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.777
I love and admire Miss Brook.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.238
And my young son needs a mother.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.490
How old is she?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.285
Seventeen.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
Some mother.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.960
Poor Catherine.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.755
You're incapable of fidelity, Charles.
You always have been.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.467
-This time is different.
-How different?

20:22.305 --> 20:23.972
I don't know.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.475
I just feel it.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.979
And it's not just
because she's beautiful.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.484
It's a marriage of true souls.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.322
Surely you can understand that.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.588
Oh, sun, go away.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.554
And leave us to our own devices.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.227
And l love you, Anne Boleyn.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.855
And l always will.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.943
Always?

21:19.195 --> 21:21.696
How can you say that, Thomas?

21:22.698 --> 21:25.700
Or know what fortune brings
or time changes?

21:33.626 --> 21:35.543
Time won't change me.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.636
Or this.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.743
Thomas.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.672
My Lady Anne...

22:21.507 --> 22:25.176
...you are to be congratulated
for reaching so high.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.679
Thank you, Thomas.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.433
I shall never forget
that we were once true friends.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.270
I wish I could forget.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.690
But l see you are raised too?

22:38.899 --> 22:41.026
Only as a sometimes diplomat.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.528
Thanks to the patronage
of Mr. Cromwell, we--

22:43.696 --> 22:45.905
We poets and painters
sometimes have our uses.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.117
There is someone here
I should like you to meet.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.119
Lady Anne Boleyn,
this is Mark Smeaton.

22:51.287 --> 22:55.165
Dancing master, singer, musician,
and general all-round genius.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.210
-Mr. Smeaton.
-He likes to be called just plain Mark.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.629
How could he possibly
be called plain?

23:01.797 --> 23:05.133
My Lady. It's a great pleasure.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.305
-You play the violin?
-lndeed.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.557
Play me something.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.726
Of course.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.525
Will you show me?

24:31.387 --> 24:34.139
-There's another guest at the table.
-Who is it?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.933
Sir Thomas More is staying.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.764
I wanted to thank Your Grace
for your speech to convocation.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.810
-lt was well said and very brave.
-l spoke only truth.

25:20.978 --> 25:24.981
I believe that the caveat "so far
as the law of Christ allows"...

25:25.149 --> 25:28.443
...does indeed invalidate
the whole bill.

25:28.652 --> 25:33.948
How can the law of Christ
permit a layman, even a king...

25:34.116 --> 25:35.617
...to be head of the Church?

25:37.161 --> 25:39.954
Boy, a little for me.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.889
-Amen.
-Amen.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.893
I must ask you, Sir Thomas...

26:02.686 --> 26:05.605
...if you still have a mind
to resign your office?

26:06.732 --> 26:11.069
After the vote, Your Grace,
I must confess l was sorely tempted.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.238
But, on reflection...

26:13.656 --> 26:16.157
...l am content to stay
and fight for Christendom.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.369
Oh, this is excellent news.

26:19.662 --> 26:22.997
As, indeed, is the turning again
of the archbishop.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.833
I thank God that his conscience
has finally driven him...

26:26.001 --> 26:28.503
...to condemn the king's nullity suit.

26:29.046 --> 26:34.634
And he has stated his intention
to oppose any legislation...

26:38.555 --> 26:40.556
...which might be injurious
to the Church.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.274
Get a doctor.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.192
Fetch a doctor, quick.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.696
Help, please help.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.532
God. God.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.453
Four men died of their pains.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.541
Bishop Fisher survived only
because he ate so little of the soup.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.794
It's very unfortunate, Sir Thomas.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.880
It's more than unfortunate,
Your Majesty.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.969
Fisher's cook has been arrested.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.888
But l must tell you that--

27:21.724 --> 27:26.686
That rumours abound as to the identity
of those who plotted against him.

27:28.814 --> 27:32.233
-Who?
-Wiltshire has been named.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.111
-Boleyn?
-Yes.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.738
And....

27:38.407 --> 27:40.742
Well, some people even blame
the Lady Anne.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.828
Some people will blame her
for everything!

27:44.580 --> 27:47.832
They will blame her if it rains
or if the rains fail.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.419
They'll blame her for the barrenness
of the queen and that I love her.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.255
They'll blame her for the wind that
destroys our crops...

27:54.423 --> 27:59.093
...and the storms that sink our ships.
It's all the fault of the Lady Anne.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.731
What about you, Sir Thomas?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.775
Do you blame her?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.819
Do you think she tried to poison
Bishop Fisher?

28:16.987 --> 28:20.031
-Harry, l--
-The time for Harry is over.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.287
Whoever was to blame...

28:26.538 --> 28:30.792
...the cook, Roose, tried blatantly
and almost successfully...

28:30.959 --> 28:33.711
...to poison one of Your Majesty's
great public servants...

28:33.879 --> 28:36.297
...a bishop of our Holy Church,
as well as me.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.052
If Your Majesty were to turn
a blind eye to the offence...

28:41.261 --> 28:45.181
...everyone would be forced to assume
that the attempted murders...

28:46.308 --> 28:48.393
...were done with your blessing.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.540
My Lord Boleyn.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.090
Mr. Roose...

29:19.299 --> 29:25.680
...we've been going over and over
this all day, so one more time:

29:26.181 --> 29:28.516
Who gave you the poison?

29:33.897 --> 29:37.275
Mr. Roose, it is inconceivable that
you suddenly take it upon yourself...

29:37.443 --> 29:39.902
...to murder your master
and his household...

29:40.070 --> 29:43.739
...after serving him so diligently
these past four years.

29:43.907 --> 29:47.118
Who gave you the poison?

29:51.957 --> 29:54.709
Sir, l have three daughters.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.259
What is that to me?

30:09.725 --> 30:12.727
I want them to find good husbands.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.605
But that takes money.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.237
We can pay you
for your information.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.282
No, sir.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.912
The payment is already made...

30:31.663 --> 30:33.414
...the account settled.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.928
You're a fool.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.430
And you will die for it.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.768
-Hurry, come along.
-Hold on, sir.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.524
-Lady Anne.
-Lady Anne.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.317
My lady.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.907
You. Hold a moment.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.541
Where are you taking this linen?

31:16.959 --> 31:19.627
-To the Queen's Majesty.
-Why?

31:19.795 --> 31:22.964
To make shirts for His Majesty.
She always has done.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.675
She still makes his shirts?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.010
Yes, Mistress Anne.

32:04.715 --> 32:05.923
Sweetheart.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.717
How could you?

32:07.884 --> 32:09.343
-What?
-Your shirts.

32:09.511 --> 32:12.597
She still makes your shirts.
How could you let her?

32:12.764 --> 32:15.099
I hadn't even thought about it.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.187
You told me there was nothing
intimate between you anymore.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.524
There isn't. What's intimate?
They're just shirts, for God's sake.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.901
No, they're not just shirts.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.613
They are you and me.
They are you and her.

32:29.573 --> 32:30.615
I don't understand.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.116
Then you ought to.

32:33.493 --> 32:37.913
It's so hard, when we're to be married,
but she's still here.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.459
You can't have three people
in a marriage.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.377
Why can't you see that?

32:43.545 --> 32:44.795
Why can't you understand...

32:45.005 --> 32:48.132
...that l have more things
to think about than my shirts?

32:57.517 --> 33:00.770
The king has agreed to a new
and harsh treatment of poisoners.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.147
They're to be boiled alive.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.527
He is wise to have dealt
so severely in this case.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.281
But he cannot avoid
some suspicion.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.743
At least against the Lady
and her father.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.915
We are all in the hands of God.

33:22.918 --> 33:27.922
But l worry that,
while l lie here uselessly...

33:28.340 --> 33:30.758
...the king may proceed
with his divorce...

33:30.926 --> 33:34.679
...since he has given himself
the power.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.264
I was told that at the last council...

33:37.432 --> 33:39.475
...the king became angry...

33:39.643 --> 33:41.644
...and demanded
to know what would happen...

33:41.812 --> 33:43.604
...if he went ahead
and married Anne...

33:43.772 --> 33:45.439
...without the pope's permission.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.484
And what did they say?

33:48.652 --> 33:52.988
Only Boleyn supported him.
Not even his friend Brandon.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.617
Thank God.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.873
-Catherine.
-Majesty.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.212
Husband.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.631
-How are you feeling?
-What?

34:10.799 --> 34:14.552
They told me you are suffering from
a toothache which is a terrible pain.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.846
And someone even said
you had a touch of gout.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.305
Of course I don't have gout.

34:18.473 --> 34:21.809
I don't know why you even listen
to such stupid rumours.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.519
Because I care for you.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.984
Catherine, you're going to have
to stop making my shirts.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.821
I thought you liked the shirts
I made for you.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.365
I see you are wearing one.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.161
-Henry--
-What now?

34:42.038 --> 34:44.540
Our daughter Mary has been unwell.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.419
She has not kept any food down
for eight days now.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.338
Do you not think
we should visit her?

34:51.506 --> 34:54.175
You can go and visit the princess
if you like.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.843
And you can stay there.

34:58.847 --> 35:03.225
Henry, not for our daughter, nor for
anyone, would l dream of leaving you.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.688
You know my rightful place
is by your side.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.537
I consign myself to God's mercy.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.249
Bless you, sir.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.712
Tell my girls l died easily
and with no pain.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.131
Head first?

35:34.299 --> 35:36.050
Or however it comes?

36:01.409 --> 36:03.202
Save me.

37:08.518 --> 37:10.144
Sit.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.777
Your wife looks very beautiful.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.696
You seem very happy together.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.157
Yes, we are.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.994
A happy marriage is devoutly
something to be wished for.

37:28.371 --> 37:32.416
Talking of which,
I want you to do something for me.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.612
-Your Grace.
-Madam.

38:02.364 --> 38:04.198
I need to speak to Your Majesty
alone.

38:13.959 --> 38:17.336
The king has sent you?
At this hour? Why?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.965
The king asks you to be sensible.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.385
Withdraw your appeal to Rome
and entrust your affairs to his hands.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.388
And he promises
to be more than generous.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.265
Parliament has now voted
to make him supreme...

38:30.433 --> 38:32.643
...in all matters spiritual
as well as temporal.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.395
No.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.064
Only the pope has God's power
here on Earth...

38:37.232 --> 38:39.233
...and is the image of eternal truth.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.944
-Yes, but the king is--
-Your Grace.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.322
I love and have loved His Majesty...

38:45.490 --> 38:48.158
...as much as any woman
can love a man.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.828
But l would not have borne
him company as his wife...

38:50.996 --> 38:54.415
...one moment against the voice
of my conscience.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.627
I am his true wife.

39:00.964 --> 39:04.967
Go to Rome, if you want, and argue it
there with lots of important men...

39:05.135 --> 39:08.804
...instead of here
with just one poor woman.

39:41.463 --> 39:42.546
What did she say?

39:42.714 --> 39:45.507
She said she would obey Your Majesty
in everything...

39:45.675 --> 39:48.719
...save for her obedience
to two higher powers.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.014
Which two higher powers?
The pope and the emperor?

39:52.474 --> 39:56.143
No. God and her conscience.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.198
Chapuys.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.825
-Majesty.
-You can tell your master--

40:11.993 --> 40:13.911
Actually,
you can tell anyone you like.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.497
--l will never agree to be judged
by the pope.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.832
I don't care of his threat
to excommunicate me.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.169
He can do what he likes in Rome.
I'll do what I like here.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.963
-Majesty.
-And by the way...

40:26.382 --> 40:27.841
...welcome back to court.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.010
Majesty.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.751
How was the queen?

41:03.503 --> 41:05.379
She was beautiful.

41:05.755 --> 41:08.882
It's like a thing of the other world
to watch her courage.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.285
I remember you once told me...

41:36.452 --> 41:38.954
...that you might sometimes
have to make me feel sad.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.749
Even if you didn't mean to.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.920
Are you really
going to make me sad?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.550
No.

41:52.093 --> 41:56.597
I swear to all that is holy,
all things worthy and good...

41:57.056 --> 42:01.435
...that to you l will always be true...

42:02.312 --> 42:04.104
...and never changing.

42:11.613 --> 42:14.323
I wouldn't blame you
if you don't believe me.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.328
Do you believe me?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.977
Majesty.

42:44.145 --> 42:47.105
-You sent for me?
-Anne.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.651
How should you like to go
hunting tomorrow?

42:54.364 --> 42:56.990
If that is what Your Majesty desires.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.701
We may be away for a while.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.912
Visit people.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.122
Stay with them.

43:05.333 --> 43:09.836
-Majesty, what is this all about? l--
-And when we return...

43:10.255 --> 43:12.256
...we shall be alone.

43:12.674 --> 43:14.091
Alone?

43:14.259 --> 43:17.511
You and I. Here.

43:18.763 --> 43:21.014
No third person.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.687
Do you mean it?

43:27.146 --> 43:30.148
I've already given instructions
for Catherine to leave.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.153
My God.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.535
Are you the most happy?

44:15.737 --> 44:18.989
Husband, what is it?

44:22.910 --> 44:24.703
-l saw it.
-What?

44:25.788 --> 44:28.582
-What did you see?
-l knew it a long time.

44:30.251 --> 44:34.713
I knew Luther and Tyndale
were false prophets.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.424
There's so many signs.

44:38.926 --> 44:43.597
I still don't understand.
What is it you've seen?

44:43.973 --> 44:45.766
The beast.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.727
The Antichrist.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.813
He is near at hand, Alice.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.868
Here we go.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.372
-Did you remember to pack my dress?
-Yes, madame.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.041
Beautiful morning for a ride.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.959
Beautiful.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.505
Get it tighter.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.217
Be very careful with her, John.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.177
On your honour.

45:26.391 --> 45:27.891
Get ready.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.646
Let's go.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.649
Walk on.

46:11.686 --> 46:16.022
My Lady, Mr. Secretary Cromwell
is here to see you.

46:17.567 --> 46:19.192
Madam.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.874
His Majesty commands
that you be gone from this place...

46:34.041 --> 46:36.835
...within the month
and settled at his house, the More.

46:42.383 --> 46:44.968
He did not even say goodbye.

46:51.851 --> 46:55.729
You're free, of course, to take with you
your attendants and servants.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.151
Wherever l go...

47:01.569 --> 47:03.945
...l remain his wife.

47:04.113 --> 47:06.156
And l will pray for him.

47:10.995 --> 47:14.831
There is a further matter.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.918
His Majesty wishes that you
return to him the official jewels...

47:18.085 --> 47:20.003
...of the queens of England.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.263
No.

47:30.890 --> 47:33.350
I will not give up
what is rightfully mine...

47:33.518 --> 47:36.937
...to adorn a woman
who is the scandal of Christendom.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.736
God bless Your Majesty.

48:27.989 --> 48:29.573
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

48:29.740 --> 48:32.158
-Thank you.
-Your Majesty.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.660
God bless Your Majesty.

48:33.828 --> 48:35.370
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

48:35.538 --> 48:38.582
-God bless Your Majesty.
-Thank all of you.

48:39.083 --> 48:43.962
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

48:46.007 --> 48:47.382
Your Majesty.

48:53.055 --> 48:54.973
Blessed Lady.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.601
Queen of hearts.

48:57.768 --> 49:01.229
There will be even greater crowds
than these to welcome you...

49:01.689 --> 49:03.273
...on your return to London.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.701
-God bless Your Majesty.
-Thank you.

49:49.570 --> 49:52.155
Yes? Come.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.497
Well?

50:00.665 --> 50:05.251
Majesty, I am asked to pass on
a message of farewell from the queen.

50:05.419 --> 50:09.172
She regrets that you did not wish
her goodbye...

50:09.590 --> 50:13.426
...and she enquires
after Your Majesty's health.

50:26.691 --> 50:29.526
Tell the queen l do not want
any of her goodbyes...

50:29.694 --> 50:33.780
...and have no wish to offer
her consolation.

50:33.948 --> 50:36.449
I do not care whether she asks
after my health or not.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.618
Let us stop this
and mind our own business.

50:39.078 --> 50:41.371
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.123
Get out.

50:58.848 --> 51:00.181
I'm sorry.

51:00.641 --> 51:02.684
Don't apologise.

51:14.655 --> 51:17.115
How could it have been different?

51:19.869 --> 51:22.495
And yet everything is beautiful.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.625
Don't you think?

51:28.252 --> 51:31.004
Everything is beautiful?

51:35.843 --> 51:37.635
Yes.

51:38.846 --> 51:41.681
Everything is beautiful.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.033
She's a witch...

52:00.201 --> 52:03.953
...who deserves no other fate
than to be dispatched to hell.

52:04.663 --> 52:07.540
And you will assassinate
the Lady Anne?

52:07.792 --> 52:12.045
Being a close servant of the king,
I'm in a position to do so.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.131
She has seduced
and bewitched him.

52:15.299 --> 52:19.552
He considers betraying his lawful wife
and the Holy Church.

52:21.472 --> 52:22.972
You must not stay any longer.

52:23.182 --> 52:25.475
But our prayers and hopes
go with you.
