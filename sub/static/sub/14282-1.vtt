WEBVTT

04:04.084 --> 04:05.501
Sir, we profited 75 crores...

04:05.709 --> 04:07.459
...from our Xantray fight club.

04:08.042 --> 04:09.501
50 crores from Hong Kong fight club.

04:09.751 --> 04:11.501
40 crores from Korean fight club.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.959
Raghav...we found her!

04:16.250 --> 04:17.375
Where?

04:17.375 --> 04:18.625
Hyderabad.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.501
Cut! Cut! Cut!

04:44.501 --> 04:45.667
Move!

04:46.084 --> 04:47.084
Pack up!

04:47.084 --> 04:48.917
Baby injured...l am ruined!

04:49.126 --> 04:50.876
My daughter's worth 100 crores.

04:50.876 --> 04:53.167
Call the ambulance. Call a doctor!

05:01.917 --> 05:04.667
Sir...where are you going?

05:05.001 --> 05:06.751
Wait sonny boy!

05:07.292 --> 05:09.042
Didn't you hear?

05:09.626 --> 05:11.959
I said it loud and clear... Pack up!

05:11.959 --> 05:13.542
What are all of you doing here?

05:13.542 --> 05:15.626
Pack up means pack up!

05:15.626 --> 05:16.876
Shooting resumes tomorrow.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.501
And this fake gun that you're holding.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.167
I must admit that
action isn't my forte...

05:23.417 --> 05:29.042
...but back home people use real guns
with real bullets to unbuckle their belt.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.001
Like this...

05:31.251 --> 05:32.501
They shoot...like this...

05:32.501 --> 05:33.501
Take a look...

05:33.501 --> 05:34.459
Like this...

05:34.459 --> 05:36.084
Then fire...

05:40.542 --> 05:41.292
.Q-_

05:41.792 --> 05:44.042
I was going to return your money!

05:44.542 --> 05:45.667
I mean...

05:45.667 --> 05:46.667
Dad what...

05:59.917 --> 06:01.209
What? Raghav!

06:01.542 --> 06:03.834
No, no, no!
The local police can't help you.

06:04.084 --> 06:05.709
Sir...
- Go talk to some Minister or someone.

06:05.709 --> 06:06.626
<i>Now gm!</i>

06:13.376 --> 06:16.667
We can't take any
action against Raghav.

06:17.167 --> 06:20.292
He's the reason we get votes.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.417
But...
- Sorry!

06:59.917 --> 07:02.501
I am sorry for whatever
happened with your daughter.

07:03.084 --> 07:04.334
But the problem is...

07:04.334 --> 07:07.292
...we don't have any extradition
treaty with Thailand.

07:08.417 --> 07:10.376
I mean I can notify the officials.

07:10.876 --> 07:12.751
But it's going to take a lot of time.

07:14.542 --> 07:15.834
Rama! Rama!

07:16.167 --> 07:18.626
The film was already shelved 3 times.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.209
Impossible.

07:22.167 --> 07:26.667
Not even God can save my heroine,
your daughter.

07:29.751 --> 07:30.834
There is someone.

08:10.126 --> 08:11.042
Yes.

08:15.084 --> 08:16.084
Look, Ronny.

08:16.084 --> 08:18.042
Subbu's test reports have arrived.

08:18.251 --> 08:20.126
And he can definitely speak again.

08:20.126 --> 08:22.834
All you need to do is arrange
for the money as soon as possible.

08:23.084 --> 08:25.917
Because Dr. Robert will be
in India only for few more days.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.042
Okay-

09:05.334 --> 09:06.459
You Ronny?

09:10.084 --> 09:11.917
Myself Guddu Sohan.

09:12.459 --> 09:13.834
Film Producer.

09:14.876 --> 09:18.251
I started making
a film 2 years ago.

09:19.334 --> 09:22.459
And reshot it three times.

09:23.542 --> 09:27.876
My first heroine...
eloped with her lover.

09:28.376 --> 09:32.709
The second one...
got pregnant...and ran away.

09:33.501 --> 09:34.709
And the third one...

09:35.292 --> 09:36.792
Well, she didn't run away.

09:36.959 --> 09:40.334
She was abducted...
and took her to Bangkok.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.459
Bloody...

09:45.834 --> 09:48.001
You've to bring her back.

09:48.542 --> 09:49.501
You..

09:49.501 --> 09:52.126
I'm ready to pay any price. .

09:56.251 --> 09:57.376
This is her photo.

09:57.834 --> 09:58.792
<i>'5'“; m.!</i>

10:01.542 --> 10:03.667
You need to bring her back...

10:03.667 --> 10:05.834
...and complete my shooting.

10:12.501 --> 10:13.834
Never!

10:17.417 --> 10:18.626
Save her.

10:19.001 --> 10:20.376
You love her.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.834
Please...listen to me.

10:24.751 --> 10:27.209
Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama!

10:27.709 --> 10:29.084
He won't do it.

10:30.334 --> 10:32.876
He hates her.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.792
I was afraid that he
might have stopped hating her.

10:38.626 --> 10:40.501
But there's something still left.

10:40.834 --> 10:43.167
Otherwise he wouldn't be so worried.

11:02.834 --> 11:03.584
What happened?

11:04.376 --> 11:05.917
Changed your mind?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.251
I'll do it...

11:12.001 --> 11:13.042
But only for money.

11:17.084 --> 11:18.251
Money?

11:47.084 --> 11:49.251
Sir, can you switch off your laptop?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.959
We're ready to take off.

11:51.334 --> 11:52.417
Thank you!

12:30.042 --> 12:31.001
Hey...!

12:31.667 --> 12:32.834
Why did you stop?

12:35.834 --> 12:37.292
Feeling shy?

12:37.876 --> 12:39.501
Enough with your attitude.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.001
You know I love you.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.834
Please rain...please rain.

12:44.834 --> 12:48.042
Rain so hard...and don't stop.

12:51.084 --> 12:52.126
You won't?

12:53.501 --> 12:54.667
You won't?

12:55.459 --> 12:57.251
Fine! I am not talking to you!

12:57.501 --> 12:58.334
Bye.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.876
Are you done?
- What?

13:08.876 --> 13:10.251
Checking me out.

13:10.542 --> 13:11.584
Do I look fine...

13:11.584 --> 13:13.251
...or should I lose some more weight?

13:14.542 --> 13:16.167
You must have read behind trucks!

13:16.167 --> 13:17.501
"Horn OK Please!"

13:18.084 --> 13:19.251
"Keep Distance!"

13:21.126 --> 13:24.084
Well, I was just waiting.
- For whom?

13:24.084 --> 13:25.417
You, of course.

13:25.834 --> 13:29.792
I mean...if you're done, then...

13:31.084 --> 13:32.876
...can I talk to the clouds as well?

13:35.084 --> 13:36.542
You're crazy.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.792
Nice?
- Who? Me?

13:38.792 --> 13:40.167
Your sense of humor.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.751
You'll really make
it big someday.

13:42.459 --> 13:44.376
Really?
- Yes.

13:44.376 --> 13:46.834
Everywhere you go,
people will say...

13:46.834 --> 13:48.751
fleet lost-ll

14:21.709 --> 14:22.792
Where were you?

14:24.167 --> 14:25.251
Where's Daddy?

14:25.251 --> 14:29.792
PP Khurana, pride of Ludhiana...
has entered South.

14:29.792 --> 14:32.084
Make arrangements for the shooting...

14:32.084 --> 14:35.334
Naidu sir...the heroine's
simply the best.

14:35.542 --> 14:39.459
I've trained her in dance,
drama and self-defense.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.167
She'll set the screen on fire.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.959
People will start a riot.
They'll go crazy.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.459
Commit suicides.

14:45.459 --> 14:46.959
Burn down the cinema house.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.167
I mean...cinema will be revived.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.834
People will make temples in her honor.

14:53.709 --> 14:55.542
Well...the train's 15 minutes...

14:56.667 --> 14:57.376
You're too much.

15:00.084 --> 15:01.042
Call me back.

15:01.626 --> 15:03.376
Change it!

15:08.167 --> 15:09.667
I'll go change it right away.

15:35.626 --> 15:37.001
Oh God!

<i>"Lungi Dance. Lungi Dance.

15:45.876 --> 15:47.709
I'll go check why the train's stopped.

16:34.459 --> 16:35.417
Hello, sir.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.084
Sir, water problem on the track, sir.

16:37.084 --> 16:39.876
Sir, please sit in the cabin,
sir. Please.

16:50.167 --> 16:51.209
Sir, please.

16:52.876 --> 16:54.542
Anything sir? Tea or coffee?

16:54.542 --> 16:55.751
Where are you going?

16:56.042 --> 16:57.126
Outside.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.292
Your father will get angry.

16:59.292 --> 17:00.126
Keep seated.

17:01.251 --> 17:02.917
But daddy's out there.

17:18.584 --> 17:19.666
Listen.

17:21.084 --> 17:22.001
Hi.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.501
Stop trying
to work your charms on me.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.209
It's not going to work.

17:26.541 --> 17:27.876
Stay in your limits.

17:27.876 --> 17:30.959
And please abandon any wrong
ideas you have on your mind?

17:31.959 --> 17:34.959
Why do you think I'll only
have wrong ideas about you?

17:36.501 --> 17:37.917
I can get right ideas too.

17:43.334 --> 17:45.167
You'll make it really big someday.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.001
But this is it...okay.

17:47.001 --> 17:47.959
Over.

17:48.251 --> 17:49.417
So soon?

17:51.084 --> 17:52.376

Dad's not on the train.
- You sure?

22:11.584 --> 22:13.792
Okay, relax. I'll check.
- Okay.

22:23.876 --> 22:24.876
You're here?

22:25.501 --> 22:27.084
No, I am under the train.

22:27.417 --> 22:28.542
Come on.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.751
Found him!

22:34.126 --> 22:35.376
Not yet.

Found dad!

Not yet!

He's on the train.

Hey!

Welcome.

All well?
- Very well.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.167
Father.
- Hmmmm.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.001
I thought this time...

24:08.001 --> 24:10.376
...you'll choose someone else
as captain for the boat race.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.584
I've been doing it
for seven years in a row.

24:12.917 --> 24:14.126
Its tradition, son.

24:14.584 --> 24:17.167
Only the best student of
this academy can become the captain.

You're not a kid anymore.

24:23.251 --> 24:27.542
Always feeding me the first morsel.
- I'll always be a kid for you.

24:29.834 --> 24:32.042
This time you'll have
to stay back longer.

24:33.584 --> 24:35.584
I'm not sending you back
until I don't get you married.

25:23.834 --> 25:24.751
Teacher?

25:36.792 --> 25:37.917
Qkay...

25:38.376 --> 25:40.959
Well, dad sent a letter for you.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.251
Just a minute.

25:45.584 --> 25:46.584
So sorry...

25:47.876 --> 25:49.001
Just a minute.

25:49.001 --> 25:49.959
Yeah.

Yes.

"While fighting for
our country in the army..."

26:10.251 --> 26:14.792
"...we completely forgot that we need to
protect our family and children too."

26:15.667 --> 26:17.792
"My son turned out to be a rebel."

26:18.251 --> 26:20.417
"He never follows any rules."

26:20.792 --> 26:23.126
"He likes picking a
fight without a reason."

26:24.001 --> 26:26.167
"Earlier his actions would amuse me."

26:26.792 --> 26:29.751
"But now... one thing always scares me."

26:30.209 --> 26:32.251
"What will happen to him after me?"

"This concern won't
let me die peacefully."

26:36.001 --> 26:38.126
"Save my son."

26:38.542 --> 26:41.376
"Turn him into a human being.
I request you."

26:41.834 --> 26:44.917
"Your friend, Col. Samarjeet Singh."

26:45.542 --> 26:48.042
How old are you?
- I am 23.

26:48.876 --> 26:50.042
I am sixty-eight.

26:51.334 --> 26:53.251
How old is that in English?

26:53.251 --> 26:54.501
68.

26:56.584 --> 26:57.959
Don't lie.

26:57.959 --> 26:59.626
Is it true?

26:59.834 --> 27:01.376
That's...pretty impressive.

27:01.376 --> 27:02.584
Nice.

27:03.792 --> 27:06.126
I see you like fighting.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.834
Only when someone forces my hand.

27:13.626 --> 27:15.334
Maybe you weren't prepared.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.126
Come.

27:20.376 --> 27:23.042
I don't attack women,
children and old guys.

27:25.626 --> 27:27.334
Don't be scared. Try again.

27:27.876 --> 27:29.334
Look...don't force me.

27:32.501 --> 27:34.626
Room no.29.

27:35.209 --> 27:36.959
You sleep after I sleep...

27:37.126 --> 27:39.417
...and wakeup before I do.

27:43.376 --> 27:45.417
What's 68 in Hindi?

27:48.042 --> 27:49.126
Sixty-eight.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.126
Hi. Harish Shivraman.

27:56.251 --> 27:58.959
This is Subbu. He can't speak.

27:58.959 --> 27:59.959
Qkay...

28:00.209 --> 28:01.334
Where's your bed?

28:07.209 --> 28:08.667
Bed.
- Fine.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.042
Now turn on the AC.

28:12.042 --> 28:13.167
AC's on.

28:16.917 --> 28:17.876
Fridge?

28:18.709 --> 28:19.667
Fridge!

28:23.209 --> 28:25.626
Well...will I get something to eat...

28:25.626 --> 28:27.334
You must cook yourself...

28:27.334 --> 28:28.834
Not just for yourself, but everyone.

28:28.834 --> 28:29.626
Today is a special day.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.626
'Vallam Kalli' Boat Race!

28:32.417 --> 28:33.376
Yeah!

28:33.376 --> 28:36.667
'Vallam Kalli'...
the Boat Race has begun!

28:36.667 --> 28:39.917
Around 15 teams have
participated this year.

28:39.917 --> 28:43.209
And there's a new team
participating as well...

28:43.209 --> 28:46.792
...which looks like the
biggest competition here.

29:01.376 --> 29:03.917
Raghav.

29:34.084 --> 29:35.001
Hey move.

29:35.001 --> 29:36.751
Raghav, where are you going?

29:36.751 --> 29:38.792
We've won the trophy.

29:38.792 --> 29:39.792
We're supposed to collect
the trophy back there.

29:39.792 --> 29:40.751
Where are you going?

29:42.167 --> 29:43.417
<i>SN,'</i>

29:43.417 --> 29:44.792
Who are you looking for, Raghav?

30:04.042 --> 30:06.126
Run!

30:39.084 --> 30:39.834
You?

30:41.834 --> 30:43.042
So you remember me.

30:45.209 --> 30:46.209
How can I forget?

30:46.792 --> 30:48.417
You know I felt so guilty.

30:49.334 --> 30:50.459
After meeting me?

30:50.459 --> 30:53.209
Yes. A boy that missed his train.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.459
I missed it intentionally.

30:55.459 --> 30:57.876
I thought...what the point
of catching a train...

30:59.584 --> 31:01.167
...that has no beautiful girl.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.001
Hey...where are you going?

31:19.042 --> 31:20.042
Stop staring.

31:20.751 --> 31:22.084
And praise me if you want to.

31:23.792 --> 31:25.959
Don't you have anything better
to do than getting wet in the rain?

31:26.209 --> 31:29.334
Don't you have anything
to do rather than following me?

31:31.042 --> 31:34.167
Listen...do you live in this town?

31:34.834 --> 31:35.834
No.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.292
I came here to meet my grandma.

31:37.667 --> 31:38.709
That's great.

31:40.417 --> 31:43.001
I mean...we can meet every day.

31:44.042 --> 31:45.709
Any special reason for us to meet?

31:45.917 --> 31:47.542
Every time we meet it starts to rain.

31:47.959 --> 31:49.751
Even God wants us to meet.

31:52.626 --> 31:54.667
See that Lighthouse.

31:54.667 --> 31:56.792
They say that the town looks
absolutely beautiful from up there.

31:56.792 --> 31:57.751
I really want to know.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.417
Let's go there.
Come on, let's go.

32:01.209 --> 32:03.334
You really are going to make it big.

32:04.376 --> 32:05.167
Shall we go?

32:05.167 --> 32:06.209
Come on...

32:24.417 --> 32:26.292
If there's connect between us...

32:29.709 --> 32:31.292
...then next time it rains...

32:38.709 --> 32:40.001
We will meet again.

32:43.001 --> 32:44.126
Maybe.

33:03.167 --> 33:05.251
Wait. Wait.

33:05.959 --> 33:08.001
Let's have some fun.
What say?

33:18.876 --> 33:20.959
Dude, this guy's amazing.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.292
Kuruswami's son.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.751
He's the world champion.

33:26.876 --> 33:27.876
Let's go.

33:28.167 --> 33:29.126
Come, come.

33:54.459 --> 33:55.167
Raghav.

34:15.751 --> 34:17.833
This is their nap time.

34:18.251 --> 34:20.876
Sorry, father. I was only practicing.

34:23.083 --> 34:24.208
Did you eat yet?

34:25.833 --> 34:27.626
How can I eat without you?

34:28.542 --> 34:29.792
I am waiting.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.667
What girl...

34:35.001 --> 34:37.083
Forget that girl.

34:38.792 --> 34:42.501
Don't ever make that
mistake of forgetting her.

34:43.667 --> 34:44.792
Just a minute.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.833
One can even find God
if you truly seek Him.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.126
Why can't you find a girl?

34:52.126 --> 34:53.333
Sure you will.

34:53.751 --> 34:56.417
I can't find the opener.
- Allow me.

34:56.626 --> 34:57.417
Give it.

35:00.959 --> 35:03.459
Oh no...l drank some of it. .

35:03.917 --> 35:05.459
I'll drink it.

35:09.334 --> 35:11.751
You won't understand his case.

35:11.751 --> 35:13.417
Let me explain you.

35:14.042 --> 35:16.042
Question no.1
...are you from Punjab?

35:17.834 --> 35:20.584
With one look I can
say where one belongs from?

35:21.126 --> 35:22.584
For example...

35:25.084 --> 35:26.084
This chicken?

35:27.417 --> 35:30.042
Can you tell me whether
it's home-grown or farm-bred?

35:31.209 --> 35:31.959
Give up?

35:32.167 --> 35:33.126
I'll tell you.

35:36.876 --> 35:37.751
It's from the farm.

35:39.417 --> 35:40.542
It's uncooked.

35:40.542 --> 35:41.501
That one's better.

35:41.501 --> 35:42.376
No, no...these are uncooked too.

35:42.626 --> 35:44.084
Everything on this table is uncooked...

35:44.084 --> 35:45.084
Then you don't eat it...

35:45.417 --> 35:46.501
You'll get a stomach-infection.

35:46.667 --> 35:47.459
Don't touch.

35:49.084 --> 35:50.917
Is she a stuffed-bread or a rice-cake?

35:52.084 --> 35:53.126
She's a girl.

35:54.501 --> 35:56.626
Then stop wasting
your youth over beer.

35:56.792 --> 35:57.792
Go find her.

35:58.001 --> 35:59.167
Your sweetheart.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.417
And shower all your love on her.

36:02.501 --> 36:05.542
You... - Father? Don't
worry about the father.

36:05.542 --> 36:07.834
Let him go to hell.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.459
If the boy and girl are willing,
to hell with the father.

36:11.584 --> 36:13.667
Hey rice-cake,
stop drinking, you're drunk.

36:13.667 --> 36:14.917
Drink some Sambar instead.

36:15.917 --> 36:18.209
Do you have change for 1000 rupees?

36:18.376 --> 36:19.751
I'll get it.

36:20.709 --> 36:21.959
Sir. Sir...

36:21.959 --> 36:24.584
lam drunk.

36:25.084 --> 36:27.209
No matter how early I wake up...

36:27.417 --> 36:30.417
But no student could ever
wakeup before the Teacher.

36:41.917 --> 36:43.751
What the...
What's your problem?

36:47.334 --> 36:48.334
Go!

37:00.126 --> 37:01.376
Come on!

37:01.751 --> 37:02.709
Go!

37:11.334 --> 37:12.209
Come on!

37:32.876 --> 37:33.792
Come on!

38:27.917 --> 38:29.667
You? Here?

38:29.917 --> 38:31.709
Oh...you remember?

38:32.334 --> 38:34.167
Of course, champion.

38:35.584 --> 38:37.084
Who is it?

38:37.709 --> 38:39.751
Are you Mr. PP Khurana?

38:39.751 --> 38:41.626
Myself Nainsukh Khurana!

38:41.626 --> 38:44.376
PP Khurana died yesterday.

38:44.709 --> 38:46.167
Died? How?

38:46.334 --> 38:48.042
I don't know how.

38:48.042 --> 38:50.709
He borrowed 50,000 from me...

38:50.709 --> 38:52.292
...and said he'll double the amount.

38:52.292 --> 38:54.667
But all he gave me was double-shock.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.959
Do you have change for 1000 rupees?

38:56.959 --> 38:58.709
Last note left for buying rations.

38:58.709 --> 38:59.626
How much is that?

38:59.626 --> 39:02.626
Not 1000.
- It's okay, I'll manage.

39:03.917 --> 39:07.334
Were you supposed to take
something from him too? - No.

39:07.334 --> 39:08.417
We're here to give him something.

39:08.417 --> 39:11.042
I see...so you're the generous kind.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.209
Come in.

39:15.751 --> 39:17.626
Please, come.
- I was rehearsing for my play...

39:17.626 --> 39:20.792
The apple of my Mama's eye...
Nainsukh, the poor boy.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.459
And emotional saga.

39:24.959 --> 39:26.334
Get some tea, dear.

39:27.417 --> 39:28.376
Okay-

39:28.751 --> 39:31.667
She makes very nice.

39:32.959 --> 39:35.959
What are you doing here?
- Tea.

39:35.959 --> 39:38.167
I'll make tea...you go.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.209
He has many kinds
of business in Hong Kong.

39:40.209 --> 39:41.126
I see...

39:41.126 --> 39:42.834
A turnover of 5000.

39:42.834 --> 39:44.167
5000?

39:44.167 --> 39:46.251
5000 crore.

39:48.959 --> 39:53.292
Look...coming to the point,
I really like your daughter.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.126
And I want to marry her.

39:55.834 --> 39:57.084
I seem!

39:59.334 --> 40:02.792
Shouldn't your father
be discussing this with me?

40:03.126 --> 40:05.751
According to our customs, it's always
the elders that bring marriage proposals.

40:06.792 --> 40:09.001
Well, that's okay.
Thank you for the offer.

40:10.917 --> 40:12.376
Tea, please.

40:12.376 --> 40:13.751
Please have.

40:15.834 --> 40:16.792
Have a cup.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.876
Where's Siya?
- She's inside.

40:20.876 --> 40:21.751
I see...

40:21.917 --> 40:23.501
I wonder why she's being so coy.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.917
Oh...these silver cups
are always too hot.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.959
Well...Siya's been getting
such offers since she was a kid.

40:32.084 --> 40:33.792
She just recently signed a film...

40:33.792 --> 40:36.417
...and soon she'll star
of the film industry.

40:38.751 --> 40:41.584
I accept...your turnover's more.

40:41.584 --> 40:45.251
But don't mind,
you're a bit older as well.

40:45.251 --> 40:47.959
Fine, fine...let's do one thing.

40:48.334 --> 40:51.001
How about you ask Gandhiji?
- Meaning.

40:59.126 --> 41:00.334
Kusum!

41:00.334 --> 41:01.751
Yes.

41:02.542 --> 41:03.834
Who can be above him?

41:03.834 --> 41:05.292
He's the Father of our Nation.

41:05.459 --> 41:07.834
Take the bag, it's a token.

41:07.834 --> 41:09.751
So should I consider this a yes?

41:09.959 --> 41:12.042
Just find an auspicious date.

41:12.584 --> 41:14.167
Okay...bye.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.126
See you, friends. Bye.

42:09.834 --> 42:12.251
Stop pouring here.

42:16.084 --> 42:17.542
Rain on his house too.

42:17.542 --> 42:20.834
So that duffer knows
I am waiting for him.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.959
Fine...laugh all you want.

42:26.584 --> 42:27.834
Laugh all you want.

42:30.751 --> 42:32.667
I don't love him or anything.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.334
If he would've been here...

42:36.334 --> 42:37.959
...I would've made him friends.

42:39.126 --> 42:40.251
His bad luck!

42:45.667 --> 42:46.876
Are you done?

42:51.251 --> 42:53.501
If you're done.
can I talk to the clouds too.

42:54.792 --> 42:56.417
You're really going to make it big.

43:21.542 --> 43:24.834
<i>"I am your benefactor."</i>

43:25.209 --> 43:28.126
<i>"My heart shares a bond with yours."</i>

43:28.417 --> 43:32.126
<i>"I can't live without you."</i>

43:39.334 --> 43:44.584
<i>"Girl I need you."</i>

43:54.251 --> 43:56.292

43:56.292 --> 43:57.876
"...I'll spend in your arms."

43:58.084 --> 44:01.584
<i>"Keep your face in front of my eyes...
and let you dwell in heart."</i>

44:08.959 --> 44:12.626

I can't live without them."</i>

44:12.626 --> 44:16.334

And become a drunkard for you."</i>

44:16.334 --> 44:20.042
<i>"I can't get over your intoxication,
I'll forget the entire world.</i> "

44:20.042 --> 44:23.626
<i>"O girl...every time I see you,
My restlessness is growing."</i>

44:23.626 --> 44:26.584
<i>"Girl I need you...
It's happened for the first time."</i>

44:26.751 --> 44:30.584

I wonder how it's happened."</i>

44:30.584 --> 44:33.876
<i>"Girl I need you...
It's happened for the first time."</i>

44:33.876 --> 44:35.501
<i>"Girl I need you..."</i>

It's happened for the first time."</i>

45:42.917 --> 45:44.459
<i>"Girl I need you..."</i>

45:44.917 --> 45:46.792
<i>"Never leave you."</i>

46:01.876 --> 46:03.751
This is really close to my heart.

46:09.501 --> 46:11.042
Don't ever take it off.

46:11.876 --> 46:13.167
My dad gave me this.

46:22.251 --> 46:24.126
You're really going too far.

46:53.292 --> 46:54.876
This is not some hotel.

46:58.501 --> 47:01.584
Listen, Teacher.
I didn't come here willingly.

47:01.876 --> 47:04.126
Yet I am ready to learn...
but you don't teach me.

47:04.334 --> 47:05.709
And I never will.

47:05.709 --> 47:07.917
I don't want to learn
this nonsense either.

47:09.084 --> 47:12.001
The Shaolins have
the best Martial Arts.

47:12.001 --> 47:13.042
Chinese.

47:13.334 --> 47:14.917
World famous.

47:14.917 --> 47:16.667
I'll go there and learn.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.209
Wait.

47:21.542 --> 47:22.417
And listen.

47:24.042 --> 47:29.417
In 1542...Lord Buddha
went to China from India.

47:30.251 --> 47:33.542
He laid the foundation
of your so called Shaolin Temple.

47:34.334 --> 47:39.042
He...taught the '18 hands
of Buddha' technique...

47:39.042 --> 47:40.542
...to the monks there.

47:40.792 --> 47:44.417
And it's a part of our
'Adavugal' from our Kalhari.

47:44.667 --> 47:46.626
And for thousands of years...

47:46.834 --> 47:50.626
...it's been practiced as
'Vadakkan Style' of Kallaripattu.

47:52.001 --> 47:53.876
But you won't understand.

48:09.584 --> 48:10.709
Sober yet?

48:11.709 --> 48:12.542
Yes.

48:27.667 --> 48:30.126
When a deer wakes up in the jungle...

48:30.459 --> 48:35.876
...he thinks, if I don't run
with all my might, then I'll die.

48:36.667 --> 48:40.292
The same morning,
a lion wakes up and thinks...

48:41.167 --> 48:45.209
...if I don't run with all my might,
then I'll die of starvation.

48:46.917 --> 48:50.917
Whether you're a deer or a lion,
you must run.

48:52.751 --> 48:55.542
There's not much of a difference...

48:55.834 --> 48:57.376
...between a rebel and a soldier.

48:59.751 --> 49:05.417
It's their motive that
makes them a rebel or a soldier.

49:07.834 --> 49:09.084
Be a rebel.

49:09.542 --> 49:10.626
Be a rebel!

49:11.584 --> 49:13.292
But for a cause.

49:17.959 --> 49:21.001
Do you want to train
further...or go back?

49:21.417 --> 49:23.001
When did we ever begin?

50:03.042 --> 50:05.876
Your training began from day 1.

51:23.751 --> 51:26.167
<i>"Come on get...get up now."</i>

51:26.417 --> 51:28.917
<i>"Fill your nerves with passion."</i>

51:29.126 --> 51:31.626
<i>"Nothing is easy here."</i>

51:31.876 --> 51:34.501
<i>"Make your own way."</i>

51:34.751 --> 51:37.292
<i>"Work hard...sweat it out."</i>

51:37.459 --> 51:40.042
<i>"No stopping...no tiring here."</i>

51:40.334 --> 51:42.876
<i>"if you want to win it here."</i>

51:43.126 --> 51:46.292
<i>"Prepare yourself."</i>

51:48.334 --> 51:49.751
<i>"Get ready to fight."</i>

51:53.917 --> 51:55.417
<i>"Get ready to fight."</i>

51:59.501 --> 52:01.417
<i>"Get ready to fight."</i>

52:05.167 --> 52:06.667
<i>"Get ready to fight."</i>

52:10.751 --> 52:12.167
<i>"Get ready to fight."</i>

52:34.251 --> 52:35.126
Hey...

52:35.334 --> 52:37.751
You're good man.
- Thank you so much, sir.

52:37.959 --> 52:40.292
Not sir...Raghav.

52:41.251 --> 52:43.292
Keep it up.
Someday I'll call you to Bangkok.

52:43.542 --> 52:44.376
Really?

52:44.542 --> 52:45.376
Yeah.

53:13.334 --> 53:15.542
Siya...does this look special?

53:15.542 --> 53:16.876
It's for teacher.

53:16.876 --> 53:17.959
It's just awesome.

53:18.126 --> 53:20.417
Subu...come on, do this.

53:22.709 --> 53:23.584
How much?

53:23.584 --> 53:24.334
Rs. 10
- I see...

53:24.334 --> 53:25.292
Oh, it fell down.

53:25.959 --> 53:28.334
Ohh...that idiot's coming here too.

53:29.334 --> 53:30.292
Dad!

53:32.792 --> 53:33.792
Dad?

53:35.626 --> 53:36.917
He's your dad.
- Yes.

53:41.334 --> 53:43.209
- Go, Q01 go'

53:43.542 --> 53:44.626
Ronny...

53:44.626 --> 53:47.334
My second cousin lives on the
third floor. - That one?

53:47.334 --> 53:48.584
That window...

53:49.042 --> 53:51.376
Hello, uncle.
- Where did your Juliet go?

53:51.542 --> 53:52.417
You should've introduced me to her.

53:52.584 --> 53:53.251
What uncle?

53:53.417 --> 53:55.209
Next time for sure.
I am so sorry.

53:55.209 --> 53:57.584
How about a beer?
- I stopped drinking.

53:57.917 --> 53:59.751
But you didn't stop treating others?

54:01.334 --> 54:04.542
So...how's your Juliet?

54:04.834 --> 54:07.501
Did you kiss her yet or not?
- Let it be, uncle.

54:07.709 --> 54:09.626
Why should I tell her?
- So what?

54:09.626 --> 54:11.084
No need to be shy.

54:11.084 --> 54:12.042
Tell me.

54:12.584 --> 54:16.001
I'll be really happy
if you kissed her.

54:16.209 --> 54:18.209
You did...didn't you?

54:18.417 --> 54:20.167
Yes.

54:22.417 --> 54:24.042
I am really happy.

54:24.626 --> 54:27.209
You'll have to buy me two beers.

54:27.459 --> 54:28.917
All I need is your blessings.

54:28.917 --> 54:30.584
Always...

54:37.709 --> 54:39.042
What happened?

54:40.834 --> 54:43.501
These ladies rings are not lucky.
Take it off.

54:44.667 --> 54:46.084
Are you getting married?

54:48.209 --> 54:49.876
Yes.
- When?

54:51.001 --> 54:53.792
I haven't thought about it.
- Don't even think about it.

54:55.917 --> 54:57.251
He didn't pay me.

54:57.251 --> 54:59.084
Run away. Get lost.

55:00.542 --> 55:05.626
This is not a threat...
it's just an advice...from an elder.

55:06.626 --> 55:09.084
You always talked about
Romeo's and Juliet's.

55:09.917 --> 55:12.084
What happened at the
end of those stories?

55:15.334 --> 55:16.667
Move aside now.

55:19.542 --> 55:21.709
I have to go, move.

55:40.334 --> 55:42.126
I'll marry only Siya...

55:42.459 --> 55:46.167
Even if I have to...
get rid of him forever.

55:47.251 --> 55:48.292
What did you say?

55:51.417 --> 55:52.459
Greetings, sir.

55:53.459 --> 55:55.126
Get rid of him forever?

55:55.751 --> 55:56.834
Will you kill him?

55:58.084 --> 56:00.584
Father...l love that girl.

56:00.834 --> 56:04.292
Humans can achieve victory
over someone with his power.

56:04.834 --> 56:06.126
Make him bow.

56:06.334 --> 56:08.084
But never attain love.

56:09.417 --> 56:12.417
I won't allow this injustice
as long as I am alive.

56:33.917 --> 56:35.126
Sony, father.

56:48.542 --> 56:51.126
I've finalized your wedding date.

56:52.084 --> 56:53.584
Yes.

56:54.667 --> 56:56.126
We must go to Mangalore tomorrow...

56:56.126 --> 56:57.584
...to give the auspicious token.

58:36.334 --> 58:37.417
Thank you so much.

58:39.542 --> 58:41.001
Ronny, come.

58:41.542 --> 58:43.792
Raghav's sent for you.
- Raghav!

58:44.042 --> 58:44.917
Me?

58:45.626 --> 58:48.042
Just 5 minutes.
Let the kid finish his ice-cream.

58:48.042 --> 58:50.042
What do we do until then? Huh?

58:50.042 --> 58:51.417
Play volleyball?

58:53.917 --> 58:54.792
You decide.

59:01.876 --> 59:02.626
Sorry, sorry.

59:02.626 --> 59:03.876
Don't touch the kid.
- Sorry.

59:04.167 --> 59:06.584
My mistake.
Please... Please...

59:08.251 --> 59:09.501
I am sorry.

59:17.001 --> 59:18.292
Bye, son.

59:18.459 --> 59:20.126
Finish your ice-cream and come soon.

59:24.584 --> 59:25.584
Subbu!

59:30.417 --> 59:33.042
Subbu!

59:35.209 --> 59:37.251
Wait!

59:37.751 --> 59:39.334
Subbu!

59:50.917 --> 59:52.667
Come, come, come.

59:52.959 --> 59:54.959
Hey Subbu. Don't cry.

59:54.959 --> 59:56.501
No. I am right here.

59:56.501 --> 59:58.667
You want baby. Come.

59:59.126 --> 01:00:00.751
Please come, Subbu.

01:00:00.751 --> 01:00:02.126
Let him go.

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:07.709
No.

01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:17.251
Subbu!

01:00:30.584 --> 01:00:31.792
Subbu!

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.084
Subbu?

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.584
Subbu!

01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:04.167
Subbu!

01:01:07.626 --> 01:01:10.834
Look. You want the kid.

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:14.042
Should I let him go?

01:01:14.251 --> 01:01:15.876
Should I let him go?

01:01:15.876 --> 01:01:17.459
Here...see.

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:14.251
You Okay?

01:04:37.876 --> 01:04:41.417
You're a kid...and you'll
always be a kid.

01:04:41.709 --> 01:04:45.126
No one could ever match
me...and no one ever will.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.751
Now this fight will
end with your death.

01:05:26.876 --> 01:05:27.876
Raghav?

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:37.042
What's this fight for?

01:05:37.042 --> 01:05:38.626
How has that kid harmed you?

01:05:38.626 --> 01:05:40.417
You're the reason...

01:05:41.126 --> 01:05:43.126
...by coming in Siya's life.

01:05:45.584 --> 01:05:46.376
Siya?

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:49.251
Yes...l love her.

01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:54.001
But she loves me.
- Women only love power.

01:05:54.876 --> 01:05:56.167
You can't even save yourself...

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:57.667
...how will you save her?

01:06:05.126 --> 01:06:10.626
I can die for her...can you?
Then come forward.

01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:15.042
Come on.

01:06:18.667 --> 01:06:22.084
You're dead!

01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:24.751
What's the hurry?

01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:26.959
I am just getting started.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.876
Okay, okay...don't be afraid.

01:07:29.792 --> 01:07:31.792
It's a new place...new life.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:32.667
I can understand, yeah.

01:07:32.667 --> 01:07:34.542
I am not the kind of girl you think.

01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:37.876
When I get a chance...

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:41.209
...I will kill you.

01:07:41.209 --> 01:07:43.167
This is what I love about you.

01:07:44.376 --> 01:07:46.042
You're different.

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:49.334
I admit I came quite
late in your life.

01:07:49.334 --> 01:07:50.917
It doesn't mean I am wrong.

01:07:51.459 --> 01:07:52.959
Okay, okay, don't be scared.

01:07:52.959 --> 01:07:55.792
L...won't touch you...

01:07:56.209 --> 01:07:57.667
Until we don't get married.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:07:59.792
Marry...

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:01.251
With you...

01:08:02.709 --> 01:08:05.292
I wish you had read 'The Ramayan'.

01:08:05.292 --> 01:08:08.876
Then you would've known
that it's not possible.

01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:13.001
Stories change with time.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:19.167
And yes...this is my city.

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:22.334
Don't think someone
will come to save you.

01:08:38.376 --> 01:08:39.501
I love you.

01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:45.501
<i>"Your eyes...are uniquely charming."</i>

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:52.584
<i>"Your breath makes my heart soar..."</i>

01:08:52.584 --> 01:08:54.959
<i>"Such is your grace."</i>

01:08:55.126 --> 01:08:59.209
<i>"Your eyes...are uniquely charming."</i>

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:01.834
Hey, what are you doing?

01:09:02.084 --> 01:09:06.542
Cleaning my taxi.
- Oh, this is not your taxi.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.667
Didn't you pull the handbrake,
the car's driving away.

01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:10.376
Wait, wait wait!

01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:15.209
No, no...sorry, sorry.

01:09:15.209 --> 01:09:16.876
He's blind.

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:20.709
Do you want your license revoked?
- He blind.

01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:21.709
Oh, blind.

01:09:21.876 --> 01:09:23.292
Okay, give me a hug.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.167
Hug, me?
- Yes, hug.

01:09:25.501 --> 01:09:26.459
Sorry! Sorry!

01:09:26.459 --> 01:09:28.709
Jaaki Maaki,
did I do something good to her...

01:09:28.876 --> 01:09:30.626
...that she's hugging me?

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.417
Brother-in-law, think about my sister.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.751
That's exactly why I am hugging her,
you rascal.

01:09:34.751 --> 01:09:35.584
You can't see the world...

01:09:35.584 --> 01:09:36.667
...but you know exactly
where my cheeks are.

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:38.417
It's Valentine's Day...

01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:40.792
She's gone.

01:09:41.376 --> 01:09:43.334
Well...at least this
way I also cleaned my car.

01:09:43.501 --> 01:09:44.584
Brother-in-law.
- What?

01:09:44.584 --> 01:09:46.334
Passenger's coming.
- Passenger?

01:09:46.334 --> 01:09:47.542
Yes.

01:09:48.376 --> 01:09:51.251
Is he Indian?
- Doesn't look like one.

01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:53.334
Is he peeing in the bushes?
- Doesn't look like it.

01:09:53.334 --> 01:09:55.542
Is he ogling at the girls?
- Doesn't look like it.

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.709
Then...
- Then he must be Italian.

01:09:57.709 --> 01:10:01.292
If he's ltalian...he
won't doubt us either.

01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:04.209
Brother-in-law...good looks,
black jacket.

01:10:05.959 --> 01:10:09.667
Fair face...black jacket. Italian!

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:13.792
Chungking Street.

01:10:16.376 --> 01:10:18.292
He's saying Chungking Street.

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:20.709
Think about my sister.

01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:23.084
Come on...come.

01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:30.167
Are you going to tell me, Jaki Maki?

01:10:30.167 --> 01:10:32.292
2 breaths straight, 2 degrees right...

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:33.751
...then keep going
straight for 10 breaths.

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.542
2 breaths straight...

01:10:35.542 --> 01:10:37.167
2 degree left...

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:39.001
10 breaths ahead.

01:10:39.584 --> 01:10:42.584
Slow...slow...slow...
- Slow...

01:10:42.584 --> 01:10:44.292
Keep going. Keep going.

01:10:45.376 --> 01:10:47.042
Keep going for 10 breaths.

01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:50.042
Answer the phone, son.

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:53.334
What's the point?
Must be our creditors.

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:56.126
Could be your sister too?
- Why will sister call?

01:10:56.126 --> 01:10:58.959
You just recently became uncle.

01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:01.417
You haven't gone home for 2 years...

01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:02.667
...yet you're having kids.

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:04.917
Shut up.
- You shut up, you blind man.

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:07.376
Abuse me in Hindi if you want.

01:11:07.376 --> 01:11:09.709
Otherwise the Italian
will get suspicious.

01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:11.084
I won't get suspicious at all.

01:11:12.376 --> 01:11:15.126
Jaki Maki, she's speaking in Hindi.

01:11:15.292 --> 01:11:16.126
Indian?

01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:17.834
Please don't complain about us.

01:11:18.084 --> 01:11:20.376
He's got a license, but he can't see.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:25.376
I can see. but I can't drive.
