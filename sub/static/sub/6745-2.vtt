Before he died, I think,
in an effort to make sure

his wife got to keep

the money he'd been paid
to murder Dr. henson,

swallowed a note.

This one, with
the psychiatrist's name on it,

of his car.

From your personal
checking account,

32:06.292 --> 32:08.592
totaling $40,000.
I assume $20,000 in advance,

32:08.594 --> 32:11.161
$20,000 to be paid
upon completion,

32:11.163 --> 32:12.930
because $20,000
is the amount

32:12.932 --> 32:14.331
that you redeposited
yesterday.

why don't you have a seat?

about a few more transactions.

we took a look at your family.

supposed to make mistakes.

it's something that's
hard for you to get over.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.785

at your firm,

something like

33:11.423 --> 33:13.390
"bad outcomes
do not equal negligence."

accept things and move on.

I don't know. Uh, he's not
exactly a reliable source --

40:35.634 --> 40:37.934
slider.
Well, be careful.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.337
Diving into Alice's life
could open up some old wounds.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.472
It does.

40:42.474 --> 40:45.308
But for some reason,

40:45.310 --> 40:47.811
the more
I-I learn about her,

40:47.813 --> 40:50.513
the more important
Alice becomes to me.

40:50.515 --> 40:53.983
Yes. It works that way
for us, too.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.720
It will help you
to not exhaust yourself.

40:57.722 --> 41:00.023
I won't. Um, I just --

41:00.025 --> 41:02.725
I-I promised
another post by tomorrow.

41:02.727 --> 41:05.962
And, um,
I think I have it.

41:15.974 --> 41:19.075
Rusty:
<i> I noticed that Alice drew this</i>
<i> a lot, this -- this bird.</i>

41:19.077 --> 41:22.645
<i> It was on her shoes,</i>
<i> on -- on her -- on her tent.</i>

41:22.647 --> 41:25.148
<i> Do you know</i>
<i> anything about it?</i>

41:25.150 --> 41:26.683
Slider:<i> Not really.</i>

41:26.685 --> 41:30.553
<i> I-I mean, she said</i>
<i> it reminded of her sister.</i>
