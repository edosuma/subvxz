WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.470
Ah... That's the last
of your cavalry.

00:07.880 --> 00:11.630
And that, Father, is check mate.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.510
SHE CACKLES

00:13.560 --> 00:16.870
Yeah... never did have
much luck with my bishops.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.310
Still, it wouldn't be summer
until you'd beaten me at chess.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.350
So...

00:23.400 --> 00:26.350
~ time for a rematch?
~ 'This way, Mr Moxley.'

00:26.400 --> 00:27.750
DOG BARKS

00:27.800 --> 00:31.040
Later, perhaps. Right now,
I think I have some visitors.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.360
Father Brown, I might have known.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.750
Mrs McCarthy, Jeremiah...

00:44.800 --> 00:48.470
I was just welcoming Aggie
back to Kembleford.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.070
Bridget, how have you been keeping?

00:51.120 --> 00:53.550
Until this morning, I
was doing quite well.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.430
Then I entered the church

00:55.480 --> 00:59.390
only to find a chalice had
been snatched off the altar.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.830
Oh, dear. I presume you
have informed the police?

01:02.880 --> 01:04.709
We're on our way.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.270
But first, we thought we would
confront the culprit directly.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.990
Your son was witnessed by Mr Moxley
here, fleeing the churchyard.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.990
What rot. ALFONS!

01:15.040 --> 01:17.990
The bearded, brutish fellow.
I'll swear on the cross.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.430
~ Alfons was here all morning.
~ I saw him there with my own eyes.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.710
Aggie and her family have been
visiting Kembleford for years.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.390
If you would only take time
to get to know them...

01:28.440 --> 01:30.470
I do know them. They're all the same.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.710
And that Chalice is worth all
your caravans put together

01:33.760 --> 01:36.680
AND it's a personal
favourite of mine.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.590
Let's see what the inspector
says, shall we?

01:40.640 --> 01:44.310
You! I've warned you
about coming round here.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.230
I could make the same request.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.670
Isn't there a rubbish dump
somewhere you could occupy?

01:48.720 --> 01:51.710
Young man, we are here
to investigate a theft.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.590
DOG GROWLS Alfons.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.870
You keep away from here.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.470
Alfons...

01:57.520 --> 02:02.070
may I remind you, that
violence begets violence.

02:02.120 --> 02:06.400
And, Jeremiah, may I suggest
you don't lose your head.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.789
~ In a manner of speaking.
~ He doesn't frighten me, Father.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.270
Then I'll try harder.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.150
You're just dirty pagans,
raising dirty children

02:16.200 --> 02:18.190
on other people's land

02:18.240 --> 02:21.030
and it's always other people
that has to pay the price.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.880
BIRDS FLUTTER

02:26.480 --> 02:30.270
This is your final warning.
Keep away from this land

02:30.320 --> 02:32.550
or you'll have to be carried away...

02:32.600 --> 02:34.200
in a box.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.680 --> 03:16.590
On the third night, as
the fire burns to embers

03:16.640 --> 03:18.470
and she sits beside the cradle,

03:18.520 --> 03:23.470
Clarissa realises it's not the house
that's cursed at all, it's the baby.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.550
And in the corner of the
room, in the dying light,

03:26.600 --> 03:29.760
she sees the twitching shadow
of a wicked boggart.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.710
~ You hate it?
~ No, it's thrilling.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.870
~ One thing?
~ Yes?

03:37.920 --> 03:40.430
I'm not entirely sure I
know what a boggart is.

03:40.480 --> 03:44.550
~ Oh, that's easy. It's...
~ A boggart, Father, is
an unwelcome little imp

03:44.600 --> 03:46.390
from another world.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.230
One who causes nothing but trouble.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.270
Forgive my daughter. She has
a fine talent, I'm assured,

03:52.320 --> 03:56.070
but her fantasies are a little
far-fetched for my taste.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.670
I think it's wonderful that a
young woman has such passion.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.320
~ Hannah, I laid out a dress
for you. Go and change.
~ Yes, Daddy.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.030
You're not one of those priests
who don't partake, I hope?

04:13.080 --> 04:15.750
And what sort of priests are those?

04:17.120 --> 04:20.110
I must say, again, how
surprised I was to see you

04:20.160 --> 04:22.990
at the traveller's
camp, this morning.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.910
Surely, you of all people, know that
some souls are not worth saving?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.750
I must respectfully disagree.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.510
The travellers may not be your
sort of people, Jeremiah,

04:32.560 --> 04:34.470
but they're always
welcome at St Mary's

04:34.520 --> 04:37.350
My daughter has always
been so fond of you.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.950
So, I must thank you for escorting
her to Lady Felicia's.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.910
Without a chaperone it would
be out of the question.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.710
We are all looking forward
to hearing her latest work.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.910
Her last novel sold very well,
I hear. You must be proud.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.190
I am just happy that she spends
her time upstairs writing,

04:53.240 --> 04:56.760
not socialising with every Tom,
Dick and Sid in Kembleford.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.230
Still, they attempt to
woo her through the post,

05:01.280 --> 05:03.030
her so-called fans.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.710
All these letters are for Hannah?

05:04.760 --> 05:09.280
Yes, and gifts. Perfume from
Paris, chocolates from Belgium.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.870
Help yourself, Father.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.270
Since they published her photograph
in Modern Profile magazine,

05:19.320 --> 05:21.910
the letters seem to
come in almost daily.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.070
And let me tell you, these men have
not got literature on their minds.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.080
She's 22, Jeremiah.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.560
She is no longer a girl.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.660
And her work, I understand,
is very mature.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.630
Yes, she has done very well for herself,
there's no mistake of that.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.000
But she knows that her duties
here are her first priority.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.910
When the time is right for a suitor,

05:47.960 --> 05:50.700
it's a decision we'll take together.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.190
Ah, Hannah.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.430
Yes, you look very smart.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.150
You will read your work,

05:59.200 --> 06:02.510
take an hour to socialise,
and then return here.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.670
~ Is that clear?
~ Of course.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.950
Goodbye, Daddy.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.200
Yep. Eight o'clock, then.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.160
Don't take your eyes off her.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.670
I used to dream of losing
myself in these fields.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.190
I'd run out as far as I could go,

06:22.240 --> 06:24.550
but I was never more than
half a mile from home.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.590
Daddy still thinks of
me as that little girl.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.550
I fear, he always will.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.590
Do you know how many weddings
I've been to, Hannah?

06:32.640 --> 06:35.070
For the bride, it's always
the happiest day of her life,

06:35.120 --> 06:37.590
for the father, it's
often bittersweet.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.830
Did somebody tell you
I was courting, Father?

06:39.880 --> 06:42.070
It's not true, I assure you.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.390
All I meant to say was, sometimes
it's hard for a father

06:44.440 --> 06:46.190
to let go of his daughter.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.070
But it's necessary to
give her some freedom

06:49.120 --> 06:52.320
or let her access her
own finances, at least.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.390
~ He's unreasonably strict.
~ Mm.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.310
If my second novel is published,
I hope it will give him the chance

06:58.360 --> 07:00.390
to see how I've matured.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.310
If?

07:02.360 --> 07:04.430
From what I hear, the
literary establishment

07:04.480 --> 07:06.880
is waiting with baited breath.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.950
I wanted to ask, if you'd
be the first to read it?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.340
It would mean so much to me.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.160
It'd be an honour.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.350
Goodness, all these people.
They're not here for me?

07:43.400 --> 07:48.000
Indeed, they are. And these are
just your local fans, Hannah.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.520
Ah. Oh, Mrs McCarthy,

07:53.560 --> 07:57.350
how nice of you to come and
support our local writer.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.750
Oh, yes. And I thought
I might see Jeremiah.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.590
I do hope he has made a full
statement to the police

08:03.640 --> 08:06.070
about those... those travellers.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.830
Daddy stayed home tonight.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.990
In fact, I expect he's already
asleep by the fire.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.790
We are all distressed about
this theft, Mrs McCarthy,

08:14.840 --> 08:17.830
but the matter is now in
Inspector Sullivan's hands.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.620
Perhaps you could take the night off?

08:21.800 --> 08:25.830
~ A sherry?
~ Oh, well. Maybe a little one.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.960
Help me relax.

08:28.960 --> 08:34.230
Father Brown, Hannah. Let me
introduce, Harry Grandage.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.390
Father Brown.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.760
Harry. I'm a journalist
and a big fan.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.310
I sent Harry a copy of The
Darkest Rose last year.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.070
And I fell in love.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.910
Well, thank you, really.
Mr... Grandage?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.750
Harry, please.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.230
Harry's something of a globetrotter,

08:58.280 --> 09:00.390
he seeks out the truth.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.750
Where you deal in fiction,
he finds the facts.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.910
Sadly, my stories rarely
come with happy endings.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.070
Your words took me away, Miss Moxley,

09:09.120 --> 09:11.590
at a time when I needed saving.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.230
It's so nice to tell you in person.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.990
Come, Hannah. It's a sorry sight
to see the guest of honour

09:17.040 --> 09:19.380
without a drink in her hand.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.550
Are you staying with Lady Felicia?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.470
She mentioned a reading by Miss
Moxley, how could I resist?

09:28.520 --> 09:30.430
I've only just got
back from Brussels.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.510
I spent two months there before
travelling down to Antwerp.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.190
I was covering the damage
from the North Sea floods.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.350
So many lives affected.

09:38.400 --> 09:42.470
My work always seems to bring
me to people in times of grief.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.590
It takes its toll.

09:44.640 --> 09:49.110
So, when I read The Darkest Rose,
I was so happy to lose myself to it.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.710
It's a modern masterpiece.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.110
Well, you're certainly a fan.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.230
More than a fan.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.350
Miss Moxley's work offers escape.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.710
~ HANDBELL RINGS
~ I'm sure her second novel
will be just as uplifting.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.030
Ladies and Gentlemen,

10:03.080 --> 10:06.120
if you'd like to take your
seats, we're ready to begin.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.600
MUSIC: Kindertotenlieder
by Gustav Mahler

10:19.920 --> 10:23.870
Mrs Mallory lay stiff and
bloated at Clarissa's feet.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.430
Across her throat a tidy, fine slash,

10:27.480 --> 10:30.830
the stinging mark of
a whip sharp tail.

10:30.880 --> 10:36.030
And all around the room, she saw the
messy trail of an uninvited guest.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.070
A fresh fall of soot
blanketed the hearth

10:39.120 --> 10:42.230
and the floor was marked
by jagged claws.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.630
As she rushed to the empty cot,

10:44.680 --> 10:48.310
she saw the boggart's promise
had been fulfilled.

10:48.360 --> 10:52.000
The housekeeper was dead
and the baby was gone.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.640
APPLAUSE

11:04.080 --> 11:06.390
What a frightful story.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.470
If that's what passes
for modern literature,

11:08.520 --> 11:10.390
I'll stick with the Woman's Weekly.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.390
It's certainly a change
of tone from her.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.470
From high jinks and espionage, to
things that go bump in the night.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.710
Still, Harry seems rather impressed.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.870
I'm not sure it's Hannah's
work he's so taken with.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.070
He certainly didn't waste much
time in getting her autograph.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.790
Now, I doubt Jeremiah would approve

11:25.840 --> 11:27.670
his daughter talking to a journalist.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.550
Really! She spends all day and
night locked up in that room

11:30.600 --> 11:33.710
tap-tappidy, tap-tapping away, how's
she supposed to ever meet anybody?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.470
I don't suppose she is.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.310
Besides, she's got a lot more
to offer than just her writing.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.390
~ She's kind and beautiful and she's...
~ She's vanished.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.310
I beg your pardon?

11:45.480 --> 11:48.480
~ Where's she gone?
~ I haven't the foggiest.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.040
Excuse me. Oh, thank you.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.560
Ahem, excuse me. Thank you.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.030
No luck finding her?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.190
I've tried every room of the house.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.990
All 600 of them.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.070
She's probably away with the fairies.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.750
That seems to be where
she's most comfortable.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.990
Unfortunately, her
father was very keen

12:13.040 --> 12:15.030
on the importance of time keeping.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.950
So, unless you'd like your parish
to be without a priest...

12:18.000 --> 12:22.150
We could cut across the fields and
maybe meet her on her way home.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.240
Good idea.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.600
DOOR CREAKS

12:40.880 --> 12:43.510
Hannah?

12:43.560 --> 12:46.160
Jeremiah?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.120
~ The door was open.
~ We are not trespassing.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.310
MUFFLED THUD

13:03.360 --> 13:05.760
Father, what was that?

13:15.640 --> 13:18.720
May I borrow your hatpin,
Mrs McCarthy?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.680
Thank you.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.270
Holy mother of God!

13:49.320 --> 13:54.870
HE PRAYS IN LATIN

13:54.920 --> 13:57.350
What an almighty mess.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.430
Some kind of burglary, I suppose.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.470
Or... or maybe an attack?

14:02.520 --> 14:05.230
I mean, a dead body...

14:05.280 --> 14:09.630
and Father, what do you make of
these deep scratches on the floor?

14:09.680 --> 14:12.440
And look, soot everywhere.

14:14.480 --> 14:19.030
~ Perhaps, Hannah's boggart was here?
~ Oh, what nonsense.

14:19.080 --> 14:23.160
After this morning, I think we both
know who is responsible for this.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.390
And how do you think Alfons
disappeared? Up the chimney?

14:29.440 --> 14:31.560
DISTANT SMASHING

14:34.120 --> 14:36.630
Father, it's locked.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.680
Downstairs.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.830
Mrs McCarthy? Father Brown?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.950
Whatever's the matter?

15:04.080 --> 15:06.550
You say you came straight
from the reading, Father?

15:06.600 --> 15:10.750
That's correct. Miss
Moxley is a fine writer.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.710
So I've heard. What's
she like as a daughter?

15:13.760 --> 15:16.830
Mostly, I think, very obedient.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.420
Does she know? About her Father?

15:20.240 --> 15:24.360
She's distressed. Lady Felicia is
well acquainted with the family.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.110
She'll be looked after.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.950
Might be an idea to get some
light in here, sergeant.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.670
Shutter's locked tight,
sir. There's no key.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.430
So, did anything unusual
happen at the reading?

15:35.480 --> 15:38.310
Did Miss Moxley seem at
all distracted to you?

15:38.360 --> 15:41.840
~ She was nervous before she read.
~ What's her latest novel about?

15:42.920 --> 15:45.310
It's...

15:45.360 --> 15:48.550
it's about a murderous boggart

15:48.600 --> 15:52.070
locked in an attic wreaking havoc,

15:52.120 --> 15:56.640
scratches up the floor and then
disappears up the chimney.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.910
~ A boggart...
~ Yes, I know what a boggart
is, thank you very much.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.630
I just don't think it's likely
that one jumped out of a novel

16:04.680 --> 16:06.310
and into this study.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.790
That'll be all, Father. Thank you.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.400
Oh, you're politely
asking me to leave?

16:16.240 --> 16:19.680
~ Inspector...
~ I can be more direct, if you like?

16:27.840 --> 16:31.830
~ Break-in gone wrong, inspector?
~ Possibly, sergeant.

16:31.880 --> 16:35.800
Let's wait and see what Miss Moxley
has to say for herself, shall we?

16:43.080 --> 16:45.160
Good morning, Father.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.800
Well, don't you look dreadful?

16:53.640 --> 16:56.550
You've had your nose in that
book all night, I suppose?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.750
Well, Hannah left us
with such a cliffhanger,

16:59.800 --> 17:03.240
I wanted to see how Clarissa
faired with her little boggart.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.069
~ How did you sleep?
~ Not a wink.

17:10.119 --> 17:14.720
I had nightmares about sinister
men and wicked creatures.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.670
I'm going to speak with
Hannah this morning.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.829
She seemed very upset.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.710
Well, tell her never fear.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.160
I'm sure the inspector will catch
up with that Alfons soon enough.

17:31.840 --> 17:37.030
~ You seem certain he's involved.
~ The men clearly had history.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.030
He should be taken in for
questioning at the very least.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.150
They need to act quickly.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.350
Aggie and her family
will be leaving soon.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.600
Leaving Kembleford? Well, they can't!

17:51.320 --> 17:53.950
Mrs McCarthy, I think you
need to make your mind up

17:54.000 --> 17:59.070
because you are in danger
of sending mixed messages.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.670
Where are you going now?

18:01.720 --> 18:03.710
I'm going to the police station.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.320
A man has been murdered and somebody
must be held to account.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.110
There was a jewellery box
in the attic, Miss Moxley.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.240
I was hoping you could tell
me what the contents were?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.430
Oh...

18:23.480 --> 18:27.230
~ I'm not sure.
~ You're not sure?

18:27.280 --> 18:30.070
They were my mother's,
but I never wear them.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.830
Do you think it was stolen?

18:31.880 --> 18:35.310
Yes. There seems to have been
a struggle in the attic.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.750
Downstairs, however,
there was no sign

18:37.800 --> 18:39.910
of any forced entry into the house.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.320
Whoever was there, was most likely
welcomed in by your father.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.640
Hannah, good morning. How are you?

18:52.640 --> 18:55.960
Father, I was just asking
Miss Moxley some questions.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.670
Well, just ignore me.
Quiet as a mouse.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.240
Where were you after the reading?

19:08.320 --> 19:12.790
I was with Mr Grandage, we
walked around the grounds.

19:12.840 --> 19:17.390
Right, of course. I was boring
her with travelling stories.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.870
When Hannah realised Father Brown
had gone, she hurried home.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.350
If I had never come for drinks
in the first place...

19:24.400 --> 19:27.070
He didn't want me to go.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.120
Poor girl's exhausted.
Can't your questions wait?

19:32.280 --> 19:35.030
~ HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
~ Yes, that will be all, for now.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.480
~ I'll show you to the door, inspector.
~ Thank you.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.350
Hannah, I know this
is a terrible shock...

19:52.400 --> 19:56.550
~ Excuse me, Father. I'm sorry,
I think I need to lie down.
~ Yes.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.600
Try and rest. I'll
bring you up some tea.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.550
~ She's in shock.
~ Hm.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.470
It's only natural she should feel
guilty about leaving the house,

20:10.520 --> 20:13.260
but nobody could foresee a burglary.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.030
I think her sense of guilt
goes deeper than that.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.220
What are you suggesting?

20:21.840 --> 20:25.320
She seemed nervous about more
than her reading, yesterday.

20:26.560 --> 20:31.120
And the goodbye hug she gave
her father was rather...

20:33.240 --> 20:35.200
.. final.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.350
How long has she known Mr Grandage?

20:39.680 --> 20:43.830
As I understand, she only met
him yesterday. You were there.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.910
Lady Felicia, there seems
to be a disruption

20:45.960 --> 20:47.310
in the west part of your wood.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.720
~ I trust you wouldn't mind
accompanying me down there?
~ Yes.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.790
Jeremiah Moxley is dead

20:54.840 --> 20:58.230
and we must make sure his murderer
is brought to justice.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.470
Nobody here knows anything
of that man,

21:01.520 --> 21:04.470
besides the fact he was a sourpuss
with a face like thunder.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.150
Oh, speaking ill of the dead now?

21:07.200 --> 21:11.880
That lavender will never settle the
child, rub chamomile on the gums.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.910
Nobody asked for your
advice, thank you.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.630
Here, take him.

21:18.680 --> 21:22.230
Perhaps you could call out your son?
I've got some questions for him.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.310
If you want to speak to Alfons,
you'll have to go through me.

21:25.360 --> 21:29.230
My back may be shot, but
my fists work just fine.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.480
Ma! Go inside.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.990
Not for all the whisky in Windsor.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.110
Oh, here's the inspector now.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.870
At last, someone with
some actual authority.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.790
What seems to be the problem, here?

21:41.840 --> 21:45.230
While the whole of Kembleford is
reeling from the murder of Jeremiah,

21:45.280 --> 21:49.310
your prime suspect is about to
hitch his wagon to the next town

21:49.360 --> 21:51.070
to sell his ill-gotten gains.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.030
We had no business with that man.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.270
It's true, Jeremiah had more
enemies than friends, Mrs M.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.670
Yes, but which of those enemies
threatened his life

21:58.720 --> 22:00.710
on the very day he died?

22:00.760 --> 22:02.150
Is that right?

22:02.200 --> 22:04.470
Did you threaten Mr Moxley?

22:04.920 --> 22:07.550
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
answering my questions

22:07.600 --> 22:08.830
at the station.

22:08.880 --> 22:12.230
It wasn't a threat, it was a warning.

22:12.280 --> 22:16.200
Father Brown heard it himself,
he was standing right there.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.700
Father? Can you verify this?

22:23.200 --> 22:26.150
I don't think anybody was acting
reasonably yesterday morning...

22:26.200 --> 22:28.070
Father Brown, did you see this man

22:28.120 --> 22:31.120
threaten Jeremiah Moxley
the day he died?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.340
I saw something of the sort.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.950
That's good enough for me.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.350
I am arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Jeremiah Moxley,

22:41.400 --> 22:43.390
you are not obliged to say anything,

22:43.440 --> 22:47.630
but anything you do say will be
taken down and given in evidence.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.910
According to my records,

22:48.960 --> 22:53.350
Jeremiah has complained several
times about your presence.

22:53.400 --> 22:58.190
Is there a particular reason why you
settle so close to the Moxley house?

22:58.240 --> 23:01.360
Her ladyship has always
offered the land.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.560
From what I know of the man,
he was a controlling bully.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.270
I'm sure many people wanted him gone.

23:11.320 --> 23:14.520
May I remind you, you're
still under caution.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.870
And if you expect me to believe
you were nowhere near the house...

23:18.920 --> 23:23.280
I was at the camp. And a dozen
witnesses will confirm it.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.670
I've no doubt they will.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.270
But I'd rather stick to the evidence.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.230
So let's just wait and see if
your fingerprints match the ones

23:33.280 --> 23:35.350
we found in the attic.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.950
Shouldn't take long.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.030
In the meantime, I've requested
a warrant to search the caravans.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.550
What are you expecting to find?

23:45.680 --> 23:48.080
I'll know when I've found it.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.550
"Dear Larry..."

23:59.600 --> 24:02.910
Ah, yes, I did correct her.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.950
Rather charming, really.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.120
Added to which I have an Uncle Larry
whose birthday is fast approaching.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.910
Mr Grandage, are you planning
on staying long?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.670
Hannah asked me to stay.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.710
I think she finds some comfort in me.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.590
The two of you are becoming close.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.950
I'm pleased to say, we are.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.870
When I first read her book, I
was in the Republic of Korea,

24:27.920 --> 24:30.390
covering the war,

24:30.440 --> 24:32.630
a taste of hell.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.670
Her work offered me the
chance to escape then,

24:34.720 --> 24:37.320
and now I can do the same for her.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.910
A distraction in the worst of times.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.230
Father Brown, here you are.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.900
Hannah.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.190
If you're ready, I thought
I would escort you home.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.190
I did promise your father.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.870
That's kind, but I
think I will stay put.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.120
Felicia and Mr Grandage
are looking after me.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.310
Felicia said that one
of the travellers

25:03.360 --> 25:05.350
was arrested for Daddy's murder.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.870
Who is he?

25:09.480 --> 25:14.520
Your father had a minor dispute
yesterday with a man called Alfons.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.240
The police are investigating.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.590
How could he... To an old man?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.780
I can't bear to think...

25:25.440 --> 25:28.790
The Inspector is asking
him some questions.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.950
I'm sure if he wishes
to press charges,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
he will have to provide
serious evidence.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.270
You've no right going
through my belongings.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.830
Your son is in serious trouble,
do you realise that?

25:43.880 --> 25:46.190
You've got an awful
lot of junk in here.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.950
I trade door to door,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.630
home-made jams and wild flowers.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.790
Things I find and make myself,
what's wrong with that?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.580
Nothing at all.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.150
How much for this?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.230
Well, that's not...

26:07.280 --> 26:08.550
That don't belong to Alfons.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.750
You don't say.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.640
I mean, I've no idea
who put that there.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.460
Kembleford Boggart, perhaps?

26:24.200 --> 26:26.470
That must be a very gripping book

26:26.520 --> 26:30.220
because you haven't said
a word for an hour or more.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.720
I am so proud of you, Father.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.720
It's nice to leave the investigation
to the police, for once.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.840
On the contrary, Mrs McCarthy, my
investigations have been ongoing.

26:50.120 --> 26:54.750
And if you'll be so kind I
would like you to accompany me

26:54.800 --> 26:56.270
to the Moxley house.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.910
Whatever for?

26:57.960 --> 27:01.440
Yes, I think we both need
a lesson in perspective.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.680
And how are you proposing we
get inside the house, Father?

27:22.560 --> 27:23.700
Oh.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.710
Perhaps we could use this.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.510
Come up to the attic
and I'll explain.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.630
Miss Moxley certainly
is a popular girl,

27:40.680 --> 27:42.790
make of that what you will.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.440
They're fan letters. They
might cheer her up a little.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.980
Come along.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.100
Found in your waistcoat.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.870
I'm not sure they're
really your style.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.550
But you'd make a tidy
sum selling them.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.600
I didn't steal those.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.070
I didn't kill that man.
I've done nothing wrong,

28:18.120 --> 28:20.060
I swear on my life.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.750
You may well be swearing
on your life.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.670
The jewellery in your pocket,

28:27.720 --> 28:30.470
and now the matching fingerprints
on the attic room door.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.520
You could well be heading
for the gallows.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.510
When we entered this
room the other night,

28:39.560 --> 28:41.470
what was the first
thing you remarked on?

28:41.520 --> 28:43.070
Well, the body, obviously,

28:43.120 --> 28:45.950
and then those scratch
marks on the floor,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.940
and soot everywhere.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.110
It reminded me of Hannah's story.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.550
Like some dreadful re-enactment.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.030
Precisely.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.990
But neither of us had ever been
in this attic room before.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.710
So how would we know that
what we saw was unusual?

29:04.760 --> 29:07.030
Perhaps it wasn't unusual.

29:08.200 --> 29:12.000
What if soot fell from
that chimney every day?

29:13.680 --> 29:17.160
For instance, when somebody
retrieved something from it.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.470
Like what?

29:19.520 --> 29:21.190
For example...

29:23.800 --> 29:25.070
A key.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.990
And what if a badly hung door

29:36.040 --> 29:39.830
made marks on the floor
every time it is opened,

29:39.880 --> 29:42.620
makes the scratches of deadly talons.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.680
Not life imitating art, Mrs
McCarthy, art imitating life.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.790
It wasn't until I finished
Hannah's manuscript that

29:54.840 --> 29:58.140
I realised the most
significant image of all...

30:02.240 --> 30:04.110
The missing child.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.630
Heavens above... A baby, hidden away!

30:13.680 --> 30:16.630
To his shame, Jeremiah
Moxley was a grandfather.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.720
I believe it was his influence
that kept the child hidden.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.960
It's high time some light was
let into this gloomy place.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.710
~ Father, the chalice!
~ Mmm.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.910
What on earth is it doing here?

30:31.960 --> 30:34.230
My guess is that Jeremiah
stole it himself

30:34.280 --> 30:36.390
in an attempt to frame
the travellers.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.840
But why?

30:40.920 --> 30:44.030
Because the father of Hannah's
child was not the sort of man

30:44.080 --> 30:47.380
Jeremiah Moxley wanted
in his daughter's life.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.760
Two minutes.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.910
So, what words of comfort
do you bring me, Father?

31:05.960 --> 31:07.710
Only these.

31:07.760 --> 31:11.910
If Hannah Moxley seemed ashamed of
your relationship, if she asked you

31:11.960 --> 31:16.070
to keep quiet about it, it was only
at the insistence of her Father.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.060
You must know that.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.240
I found the nursery...

31:27.080 --> 31:30.480
.. and the key to the front
door she left for you.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.760
You were planning to
leave together, yes?

31:36.080 --> 31:38.070
She swore me to secrecy.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.310
She was terrified about what
people would think of her

31:41.360 --> 31:43.470
and of our child.

31:43.520 --> 31:47.280
She was desperate to leave but
only if nobody knew the truth.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.270
Well, now your life is at stake

31:55.320 --> 31:59.960
and I fear her father's shame may
last for the rest of her life.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.200
They found her jewellery,
Father, in my waistcoat.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.910
Ah, I see.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.750
She told me to take
it from the house.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.270
Jeremiah controls her money, just
like he controls everything else.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.720
Those jewels were the only
thing of value she has.

32:20.760 --> 32:24.160
We first made plans
to leave last summer.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.190
She was freer, then.

32:27.240 --> 32:32.030
She'd visit the camp,
read us her stories.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.550
I never intended it to...

32:34.600 --> 32:35.870
But...

32:37.840 --> 32:39.640
You fell in love.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.990
And she fell pregnant. Her
father was beside himself.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.990
"I've just locked her up."
When she first came to see me,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.470
just a few days ago, she
told me about the child.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.070
She told me where
to find her door key

32:53.120 --> 32:55.790
and she promised to meet
me from the party.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.750
I was worried her father
would catch me

32:57.800 --> 33:00.540
sneaking back into the house, but...

33:02.280 --> 33:04.550
Jeremiah was already dead.

33:06.840 --> 33:11.000
And when you heard us, you
locked the study door and...

33:13.280 --> 33:14.590
Holy Mother of God.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.350
'.. hid in the nursery.'

33:16.400 --> 33:19.470
'I could heard you
but I was trapped.'

33:19.520 --> 33:21.910
So you created a diversion.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.150
'Up the chimney.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.550
'Leaving me to ponder
a broken flowerpot

33:27.600 --> 33:31.030
and a distressed geranium.'

33:31.080 --> 33:32.790
I could have killed him.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.470
For what he'd done to us, the way
he kept them locked up in that house

33:36.520 --> 33:40.790
but I swear, Father, on
the Lord's name, I didn't.

33:40.840 --> 33:44.560
I found him there, dead,
beside that letter opener.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.710
Letter opener.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.230
Of course.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.190
Initially, I thought that the
murderer must be close to home

33:55.240 --> 34:02.560
but now, I realise that he has been
at a safe distance all the time.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.989
Father, nice to see you.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.270
You've caught me on
my way out of town.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.920
Just come from Lady Felicia's,
looking for Hannah.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.480
Well, that is her shawl
in the back of your car?

34:31.600 --> 34:33.989
I've offered her a place
to stay in the city.

34:34.040 --> 34:37.070
She's desperately in need of escape.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.310
I presume you'll be informing
Inspector Sullivan she's leaving?

34:40.360 --> 34:43.550
Actually, Father, we were hoping
for a bit of discretion,

34:43.600 --> 34:44.870
a new start for the girl.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.110
I've offered to help
her in any way I can.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.500
Things are very complicated.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.380
Don't mind, do you?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.950
I know about the baby, Harry.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.400
I've just met with his father.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.320
Yes. A terrible business.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.630
She feels quite betrayed
by him, obviously.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.870
She'll be back from the
camp any moment now -

35:13.920 --> 35:17.150
I'm sure she'd rather just
disappear with little fuss.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.670
I'm trying to piece together a story,

35:19.720 --> 35:22.190
and I have a few pages missing.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.950
I thought you might be able to
fill in the gaps while we wait.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.470
I'm not sure I'll be much help.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.430
Yesterday, when she signed your book,

35:32.480 --> 35:35.070
I saw a frown set on your face.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.390
She got my name wrong.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.990
It was more than that.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.440
She had no idea who you were.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.590
And when you first saw her
handwriting, you realised

35:45.640 --> 35:48.310
you had no idea who she was either.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.550
It was then, I think, you
decided to pay a visit

35:51.600 --> 35:53.470
to the place you'd been writing to.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.390
Writing to? I don't
know what you mean.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.840
You had been writing to her
from Belgium for months.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.560
And you thought that she
was writing back to you.

36:08.320 --> 36:12.590
But you had no idea she didn't
even get to read her fan mail.

36:12.640 --> 36:17.270
Her father controlled that, as
he controlled everything else.

36:17.320 --> 36:21.350
You felt betrayed. It must
have made you very angry.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.800
This is a wonderful work of fiction,
Father. You're quite the fantasist.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.430
Father Brown!

36:27.480 --> 36:29.070
I can explain.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.590
BABY CRIES

36:37.280 --> 36:38.910
There's no need.

36:38.960 --> 36:43.150
I've seen the nursery for myself
and I've spoken to Alfons.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.750
What a beautiful baby
boy you both have.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.940
He deserves a good life.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.430
I wish we could we
could stay, Father,

36:50.480 --> 36:53.310
but I can't imagine what people
would say if they knew.

36:53.360 --> 36:56.270
Hannah, listen. I don't think
Alfons killed your father.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.710
~ We really must go.
~ I wish I had your faith,

36:58.760 --> 37:01.350
but I don't know what
to believe any more.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.790
Goodbye, Father. Pray for us.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.990
When I went to your house,

37:06.040 --> 37:09.310
the key you left for Alfons
was still beneath the statue.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.670
He didn't need it to get in, because
somebody was already there,

37:12.720 --> 37:15.390
~ with your father.
~ Why were you at my house?

37:15.440 --> 37:19.030
I think it's time you read
some of your fan mail.

37:19.080 --> 37:23.950
This one from Belgium is
particularly interesting.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.430
Hannah...

37:25.480 --> 37:26.910
BABY GURGLES

37:26.960 --> 37:32.510
You span a good story, Harry, and
now it's time the truth comes out.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.030
I know you think you're
trying to help the girl,

37:35.080 --> 37:36.830
but please, just let us go.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.230
She's made her choice.
Hannah! Get in the car.

37:39.280 --> 37:43.990
She is a grieving woman who
has been easily influenced.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.870
You have manipulated her into thinking
that she is safe with you,

37:47.920 --> 37:50.830
while an innocent man
may be sent to hang.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.110
What does this letter mean, Harry?

37:53.160 --> 37:55.150
Have you been writing to me?

37:55.200 --> 37:56.950
Yes.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.750
He has been writing to you.

37:58.800 --> 38:03.550
He and your father have been
making plans for your future.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.070
Harry didn't come back to
Kembleford for your latest work.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.830
He came back for you.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.350
It wasn't like that,
Hannah. I didn't know!

38:12.400 --> 38:15.800
I thought it was you writing
back to me, I thought we were...

38:20.760 --> 38:23.790
You were at my house last night?

38:23.840 --> 38:25.830
It was you.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.800
For your own sake, tell the truth.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.590
I only wanted what is best for you.

38:33.640 --> 38:37.470
Your father told me he had been
writing back to me on your behalf.

38:37.520 --> 38:41.110
That he needed to be sure I was
the correct suitor for you.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.990
What kind of twisted old man are you?

38:43.040 --> 38:44.910
I was going to explain
everything to her.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.430
It's much more complicated...

38:46.480 --> 38:47.750
'I was furious.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.550
'Humiliated.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.070
'And then, as we spoke downstairs,
I heard the baby cry.'

38:53.120 --> 38:54.430
BABY CRIES

38:54.480 --> 38:56.110
What in God's name?

38:56.160 --> 38:58.790
It didn't make a difference
to me. I wanted you both.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.950
But he wouldn't listen...

39:00.000 --> 39:03.470
A baby. All this while, you've
been hiding a child?

39:03.520 --> 39:06.310
No, no, no, no! Please, please!
The girl made one mistake.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.190
There is no reason why
anyone should know.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.190
~ I'm going back to the party.
~ No, you're not!

39:10.240 --> 39:12.670
~ I need to speak with her.
~ No! You mustn't! You can't.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.310
'When I threatened to tell you
the truth, he turned on me.

39:15.360 --> 39:18.520
'He was too afraid to lose you.
It was an accident, I swear.'

39:24.200 --> 39:25.310
GRUNTING

39:25.360 --> 39:26.830
HE SCREAMS

39:26.880 --> 39:28.440
BABY CRIES

39:29.960 --> 39:32.790
All I wanted was to take you
away, to escape with you.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.150
~ Isn't that what you wanted?
~ No!

39:35.200 --> 39:37.950
You're no better than he was.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.510
You want to control me.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.670
Well, I won't let you.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.350
I've spent too long locked away.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.790
I want a free life.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.310
I owe that much to him.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.190
Hannah, please!

39:51.240 --> 39:53.240
BABY CRIES

39:56.360 --> 40:00.670
When that child is safely
with his grandmother,

40:00.720 --> 40:04.190
she will take that
letter to the police.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.710
He came at me. I had no choice.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.420
Then that is what you must tell them.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.830
I don't know how any
of this happened!

40:14.880 --> 40:19.030
All I wanted was to escape
to the life she wrote about.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.820
No more misery and suffering, just...

40:23.040 --> 40:24.840
.. a family.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.580
Some peace.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.640
If you love the girl,
you must come clean.

40:32.640 --> 40:33.870
For her sake?

40:33.920 --> 40:36.390
No, no.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.350
For your sake.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.670
For the sake of your soul.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
You may not get YOUR
happy ending, Harry.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.200
But you can give Hannah
the life she deserves.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.630
So, has he confessed yet?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.350
Father Brown left in a hurry.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.990
I don't think he's convinced
you've got your man, Inspector.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.710
The problem with the
priest, sergeant,

41:03.760 --> 41:05.670
is that he
over-complicates everything.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.270
Alfons couldn't be easier to convict

41:07.320 --> 41:10.480
if he'd walked into the station
and handed himself over.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.750
Yes, sir, how can I help you?

41:14.800 --> 41:17.070
My name is Harry Grandage.

41:17.510 --> 41:18.510
I'm here to confess

41:18.560 --> 41:21.760
to the accidental killing
of Jeremiah Moxley.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.560
CHURCH BELLS RING

41:30.120 --> 41:32.670
In nomine Patris

41:32.720 --> 41:34.790
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.400
ALL: Amen.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.270
Jeremiah, may you be
blessed with a life

41:41.320 --> 41:44.600
free from intolerance
and free from shame.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.880
ORGAN PLAYS

41:59.760 --> 42:01.950
Would you mind?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.870
Hello, sweetheart.

42:07.440 --> 42:12.350
Oh, look at them. What a
perfectly beautiful family.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.150
It's not hard to see why Harry
would crave such a life.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.350
He spent so long reporting
the worst of the world.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.910
Perhaps he'd seen enough.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.310
Too much of the world is
better than not enough.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.990
And for better or worse,
Hannah is a free woman now.

42:24.040 --> 42:28.390
And in the end, Harry
did the right thing.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.710
With the church's guidance!

42:31.760 --> 42:33.430
Oh, excuse me.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.510
I owe you an apology.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.270
You owe us more than one.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.430
As though my Alfons
could do such a thing.

42:43.480 --> 42:48.670
I was taken in by Jeremiah's lies,
and I feel terrible for it.

42:48.720 --> 42:51.150
So this is for you.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.110
For your back - it's a muscle rub.

42:54.160 --> 42:57.550
St John's wort and valerian,
my mother's own remedy.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.710
I use witch hazel and beeswax.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.870
Oh, this will work much
better. I made it myself.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.510
All right.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.150
Worth a try.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.510
Well, when all's said and done,

43:09.560 --> 43:12.350
we're not so different,
Aggie and myself.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.590
What's this, Mrs McCarthy,
a change of heart?

43:14.640 --> 43:16.750
"Absolute heathen", wasn't it?

43:16.800 --> 43:18.590
"Nothing but a pest..."

43:18.640 --> 43:21.070
I never said such things.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.590
Malicious gossip. Pure fiction.

43:24.040 --> 43:28.120
And remember, there's a fine
line between fact and fantasy.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.830
Couldn't have put it better myself.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.160
Walk on.
