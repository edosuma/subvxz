00:14.233 --> 00:15.033
DIVORCE PAPERS.

00:15.067 --> 00:16.533
THE BALL'S IN YOUR COURT.
IF YOU SIGN,

00:16.567 --> 00:18.367
I'LL SIGN AND BE ON
THE FIRST PLANE OUT OF HERE.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.300
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT
WITH ME TONIGHT?

00:20.333 --> 00:21.667
THE HOSPITAL GRANTS YOU

00:21.700 --> 00:23.300
FOUR MONTHS TO RETAKE
THE MEDICAL BOARD EXAM.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.233
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T PASS
THE SECOND TIME?

00:25.267 --> 00:27.167
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE A SURGICAL
RESIDENT AT SEATTLE GRACE.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.100
YOU LOOK GREAT.
THANKS.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.400
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH. YOU READY TO GO?

00:30.433 --> 00:33.400
I DIDN'T LIE.
YOU WITHHELD THE TRUTH.
HOW DID I KNOW YOU WERE--

00:33.433 --> 00:35.233
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER YOU
BREAKING THINGS OFF WITH ME.

00:35.267 --> 00:36.500
(Woman) DR. YANG.
CRISTINA.

00:36.533 --> 00:38.100
(Addison) IT WAS
AN EXTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY.

00:38.133 --> 00:39.367
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.033
I DON'T THINK
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.367
(Addison) I DON'T WANT SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T WANT ME, MEREDITH,

00:44.400 --> 00:46.333
BUT IF THERE'S THE SLIGHTEST
CHANCE THAT HE DOES,

00:46.367 --> 00:48.800
I'M NOT LEAVING SEATTLE.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.433
(thunder rumbles)

00:52.467 --> 00:55.100
(Meredith)
PAIN COMES IN ALL FORMS...

00:55.133 --> 00:57.300
I HAD A GOOD TIME. REALLY.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.300
THANK YOU. IT WAS JUST
THE PERFECT EVENING.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.500
BEST DATE EVER. EVER.
IZZIE.

01:01.533 --> 01:03.433
YOU KNOW, I ESPECIALLY
LIKED THE PART

01:03.467 --> 01:05.733
WHERE YOU TREATED ME
LIKE CRAP THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

01:05.767 --> 01:07.433
THAT WAS FUN.
I HAD A GOOD TIME.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.133
REALLY?

01:09.167 --> 01:10.100
YEAH.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.600
THE SMALL TWINGE,

01:11.633 --> 01:14.167
A BIT OF SORENESS,
THE RANDOM PAIN,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.600
THE NORMAL PAINS WE LIVE WITH
EVERY DAY...

01:16.633 --> 01:18.700
I GOTTA GO.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.333
***

01:20.367 --> 01:23.200
SERIOUSLY?

01:23.233 --> 01:25.133
SERIOUSLY?

01:25.167 --> 01:27.767
THEN THERE'S THE KIND OF PAIN
YOU CAN'T IGNORE.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.133
SERIOUSLY?
A LEVEL OF PAIN SO GREAT

01:30.167 --> 01:32.667
MOVE OVER.
THAT IT BLOCKS OUT
EVERYTHING ELSE...

01:32.700 --> 01:35.133
OH, I WAS SLEEPING.
OH, SHUT UP.

01:35.167 --> 01:36.500
(thunder rumbles)

01:36.533 --> 01:39.567
MAKES THE REST OF THE WORLD
FADE AWAY...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.333
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN.
MEREDITH.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.267
YOU DIDN'T SIGN
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.333
FINE. I GET IT.
END OF DISCUSSION.
MEREDITH.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.133
WHAT?!

01:47.167 --> 01:49.067
UNTIL ALL
WE CAN THINK ABOUT...

01:49.100 --> 01:51.067
OH.
IS HOW MUCH WE HURT...

01:51.067 --> 01:52.800
I USUALLY JUST SAY "MEREDITH,"
AND THEN YOU YELL AT ME.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.067
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
PAST THAT POINT.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.567
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING PLANNED.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.767
HOW WE MANAGE OUR PAIN
IS UP TO US.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.167
WHAT IS THAT?
HEY, STOP IT!

02:01.200 --> 02:03.567
SERIOUSLY?! SERIOUSLY?

02:03.600 --> 02:04.700
SERIOUSLY?

02:04.733 --> 02:08.233
THIS IS A VERY SMALL BED.

02:08.267 --> 02:10.167
HE'S A BRAIN SURGEON.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.067
I LOOK FANTASTIC.
I SHAVED MY LEGS.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.667
HE'S A BRAIN SURGEON.
HOW CAN HE BE SO BRAINLESS?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.600
HELLO? SERIOUSLY.

02:18.633 --> 02:19.800
SERIOUSLY.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.633
SHH.

02:21.667 --> 02:23.600
(thunder rumbles)

02:23.633 --> 02:25.433
PAIN...

02:25.467 --> 02:26.767
WE ANESTHETIZE,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.167
RIDE IT OUT, EMBRACE IT,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.100
IGNORE IT...

02:32.133 --> 02:35.067
***

02:37.300 --> 02:40.167
AND FOR SOME OF US,
THE BEST WAY TO MANAGE PAIN

02:40.200 --> 02:42.533
IS JUST TO PUSH THROUGH IT.

02:42.567 --> 02:45.467
***

02:48.567 --> 02:49.733
YOU'RE DRIPPIN'.
I'M BACK.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.733
I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR.
I'M BACK. I'M READY TO WORK.

02:52.767 --> 02:55.300
HAS ANYONE SEEN DR. SHEPHERD
THIS MORNING?

02:55.333 --> 02:57.233
HIS NAME'S ON THE O.R. BOARD.
HE SHOULD BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

02:57.267 --> 02:59.167
I'M GOOD.
I'M READY TO SCRUB IN.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.733
I'M 100% ON TOP OF MY GAME.

03:00.767 --> 03:02.067
YOU JUST GOT DISCHARGED.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.700
PACE YOURSELF.
I'M PACED. I'M PACED.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.767
MM-HMM. ROUNDS, PEOPLE.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.733
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT
TALKIN' TO ME ANYMORE?

03:09.767 --> 03:12.567
OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

03:12.600 --> 03:14.233
I'M FINE.

03:14.267 --> 03:16.167
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

03:16.200 --> 03:18.700
FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, ALEX?

03:18.733 --> 03:20.667
NO, I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU ANYMORE.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.167
AHEM. DR. BAILEY?

03:25.200 --> 03:28.700
HENRY LAMOTT, AGE 42,
IS SCHEDULED WITH DR. SHEPHERD

03:28.733 --> 03:31.833
FOR A SPINAL IMPLANT TO CONTROL
THE PAIN OF HIS HERNIATED DISC,

03:31.867 --> 03:33.767
IS ALLERGIC TO
ALL PAIN MEDICATION.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.433
(sexy music playing)
IS THAT...

03:35.467 --> 03:38.200
PORN.
PORN?

03:38.233 --> 03:39.733
AS IN "PORN"?
ALL RIGHT.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.600
WHAT ARE WE WATCHING?

03:41.633 --> 03:42.833
KAREV, GO STAND
IN THE HALL.

03:42.867 --> 03:45.067
UH, MR. AND MRS. LAMOTT,

03:45.067 --> 03:46.800
I'M SURE YOU ARE
REALLY NICE PEOPLE,

03:46.833 --> 03:49.400
AND WHAT YOU DO
IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN--

03:49.433 --> 03:50.767
(Woman laughs)

03:50.800 --> 03:52.767
LOOK, WE CAN'T HAVE PORN
IN HERE. THIS IS A HOSPITAL.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.700
IT'S FOR MY PAIN.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.633
MY DOC SAYS IT RELEASES
ENDORPHINS IN THE BRAIN,

03:56.667 --> 03:59.300
AND IT HELPS KEEP MY PAIN
AT A MANAGEABLE LEVEL.

03:59.333 --> 04:00.400
REALLY?
(Woman laughing)

04:00.433 --> 04:01.600
GEORGE--HALL.
YEAH.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.633

04:05.500 --> 04:08.267
WHAT IS THIS?

04:08.300 --> 04:11.167
"NASTY, NAUGHTY NURSES..."
UM, "4."

04:11.200 --> 04:14.167
(Women laughing)

04:15.167 --> 04:17.067
THAT DOES NOT
LOOK COMFORTABLE.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.367
TRUST ME, IT'S NOT.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.433
GET IN THE HALL.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.067
STEVENS,
THERE'S A CARDIAC PATIENT

04:55.100 --> 04:56.433
WAITING FOR YOU UP ON TWO.

04:56.467 --> 04:57.800
YANG, KEEP AN EYE
ON THE LAMOTTS.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.533
I DON'T WANT
ANY PROBLEMS. GO.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.500
GREY, YOUR MOTHER'S BEING
DISCHARGED THIS EVENING.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.567
YOU'VE MADE ARRANGEMENTS,
OR DO YOU NEED MORE TIME?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.500
THE NURSING HOME
IS COMING AT 8.

05:06.533 --> 05:09.400
ALL RIGHT. THEN YOU'RE WITH
SHEPHERD--DEREK SHEPHERD TODAY.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.333
HEY, LIFE IS SHORT.
TIMES ARE HARD.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.200
THE ROAD IS LONG
WITH MANY A WINDING TURN.

05:13.233 --> 05:16.067
HE ASKED FOR YOU.
TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.

05:18.567 --> 05:19.600
OKAY.

05:19.633 --> 05:21.400
PETE WILLOUGHBY,

05:21.433 --> 05:24.667
25-YEAR-OLD G.S.W.
TO THE CHEST.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.300
IMMEDIATE RETURN
OF 860 c.c.s OF BLOOD...

05:27.333 --> 05:30.300
OH, MAN, THIS HURTS.
HE'S PUT OUT MORE THAN 200 c.c.s
OVER THE PAST HOUR.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.500
THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN MOVIES
HOW MUCH IT HURTS TO GET SHOT.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.433
PUSH MORPHINE, 2 MILLIGRAMS.
ALEX, THIS IS MY CASE.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.767
MORPHINE, 5 MILLIGRAMS.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL HIM.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.567
I DON'T HAVE TO CALL HIM.
I WAS HERE FIRST.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.633
YOU GOT HERE FIRST BECAUSE
I LET YOU.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.733
WHERE'S THE CHEST FILMS?
UNH.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.667
I GOT 'EM.
YOU ALWAYS GET THE SURGERY.

05:44.700 --> 05:47.200
TODAY,
I'M GETTING A SURGERY.
GUYS, KNOCK IT OFF.

05:47.233 --> 05:48.667
HE'S ONE OF SEATTLE'S FINEST.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.500
YOU'VE GOT AN ENTIRE
POLICE FORCE WATCHING YOU.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.067
(George) PAGE DR. BURKE.

05:56.067 --> 05:58.133
LET HIM KNOW I'M BRINGIN' UP
A G.S.W.

05:58.167 --> 06:00.667
THAT WE ARE BRINGING UP
A G.S.W.

06:02.467 --> 06:05.367
LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO GO HOME TODAY, ELLIS.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.433
BUT I STILL
HAVE PATIENTS TO SEE.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.333
NO. NO MORE PATIENTS.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.200
I'LL BE BACK
TO CHECK ON YOU LATER, OKAY?

06:12.233 --> 06:14.067
YOU SHOULD KNOW I'M THINKING
OF LEAVING THATCHER.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.100
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE MARRIED HIM.

06:17.133 --> 06:20.633
I'LL LEAVE HIM, YOU LEAVE ADELE.
THEN WHEN OUR RESIDENCY'S OVER,

06:20.667 --> 06:23.067
WE CAN BOTH GET JOBS
AT THE SAME HOSPITAL.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.133
WHY DON'T YOU GET HER MEDS
READY FOR DISCHARGE, NURSE?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.400
THANK YOU.

DR. CHIN, TWO WEST.

06:31.667 --> 06:35.533
ELLIS... THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO, REMEMBER?

06:35.567 --> 06:38.167
WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION
21 YEARS AGO.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.733
THINK ABOUT IT, RICHARD.
WE SHOULD MAKE THE BREAK NOW.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.667
IF WE WAIT
UNTIL RESIDENCY'S OVER,

06:42.700 --> 06:44.600
YOU'LL BE AT ONE HOSPITAL,
AND I'LL BE AT ANOTHER.

06:44.633 --> 06:45.667
WE COULD END UP

06:45.700 --> 06:49.133
AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE COUNTRY.
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

06:52.433 --> 06:55.267
(elevator bell dings)
MEREDITH.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.200
YOUR WIFE
IS LOOKING FOR YOU.
OH, MY GOD.

06:57.233 --> 06:59.533
THIS IS HARD
FOR ME, MEREDITH.
WELL, LET ME
MAKE IT EASY, THEN.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.467
I'M NOT GONNA BE
THAT WOMAN--

07:01.500 --> 07:03.433
THE ONE WHO BREAKS UP A MARRIAGE
OR BEGS YOU TO WANT ME.

07:03.467 --> 07:06.700
YOU CAN SIGN THE PAPERS OR
YOU CANNOT. THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

07:06.733 --> 07:09.333
EITHER WAY, WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS RELATIONSHIP, I'M OUT.

07:09.367 --> 07:10.767
NOW WHERE'S THIS PATIENT

07:10.800 --> 07:12.700
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING YOU WITH?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.500
DOWN THERE.

07:15.567 --> 07:18.200
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED
TO WALK THE DOG IN THE RAIN.

07:18.233 --> 07:21.100
OH, LOU, IT WASN'T THE RAIN.
I JUST PASSED OUT.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.833
ACTUALLY, MRS. BRADLEY--
VERNA.

07:22.867 --> 07:25.800
VERNA, YOU PRESENTED
WITH LATERAL S.T. ELEVATIONS

07:25.833 --> 07:28.433
AND RECIPROCAL INFERIOR CHANGES
CONSISTENT WITH AN M.I.--

07:28.467 --> 07:30.367
A HEART ATTACK.
(Lou) OH, MY GOD.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.167
LOU, DON'T WORRY. COME ON.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.100
I'VE HAD THESE LITTLE
CHEST PAINS BEFORE,

07:34.133 --> 07:36.600
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING.
THIS IS NOTHING.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.267
LOU, NOT IN FRONT
OF THE DOCTOR.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.733
I'VE HAD A TWINGE
IN MY BACK FOR AWHILE.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.667
I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AWAY,

07:45.700 --> 07:47.600
BUT THEN LAST NIGHT,
MY LEGS WENT NUMB,

07:47.633 --> 07:51.300
AND THIS MORNING, MY BACK--
THE PAIN IS JUST TOO MUCH.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.233
MS. CHUE, LET ME PUT YOU
ON A P.C.A. PUMP,

07:53.267 --> 07:55.533
GIVE YOU SOME MORPHINE, WHICH
SHOULD HELP CONTROL THE PAIN.

07:55.567 --> 07:57.167
THANK YOU.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.633
BUT THERE'S A GREATER
PROBLEM HERE.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.300
I'VE JUST TAKEN A LOOK
AT YOUR M.R.I.--
ANNA...

08:02.333 --> 08:04.300
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL US
BEFORE COMING DOWN HERE?

08:04.333 --> 08:05.600
I'M SORRY.

08:05.633 --> 08:08.133
THESE ARE MY PARENTS.
HI.

08:08.167 --> 08:11.067
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO EXPLAIN
THAT ANNA'S M.R.I.

08:11.067 --> 08:13.833
HAS SHOWN THAT SHE HAS
A MYXOPAPILLARY EPENDYMOMA--

08:13.867 --> 08:15.767
IT'S A TUMOR
IN HER SPINAL CANAL,

08:15.800 --> 08:17.533
BUT THE GOOD NEWS
IS THAT WE CAN OPERATE.

08:17.567 --> 08:19.733
YOU HAVE A 95% CHANCE
OF FULLY RECOVERING

08:19.767 --> 08:22.533
IF WE GET YOU INTO SURGERY
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.400
WE CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER MOMENT.
WITH A TUMOR THIS AGGRESSIVE,

08:24.433 --> 08:26.333
EVEN WAITING ANOTHER DAY
PUTS YOU AT RISK

08:26.367 --> 08:28.467
FOR PERMANENT PARALYSIS.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.233
FATHER?

08:30.267 --> 08:32.400
NO.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.067
NO SURGERY.

08:34.067 --> 08:36.800
MR. CHUE, WITHOUT SURGERY,
ANNA WILL BE PARALYZED

08:36.833 --> 08:39.133
PROBABLY WITHIN
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.500
THERE'LL BE NO SURGERY TODAY.
WE'RE TAKING HER HOME.

08:41.533 --> 08:44.133
ANNA NEEDS THE SURGERY.
THEN SHE CAN HAVE IT
AT ANOTHER TIME.

08:44.167 --> 08:47.667
LOOK, MR. CHUE--
WE ARE TAKING
OUR DAUGHTER HOME.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.100
ANNA, YOU'VE OVER 18.

08:52.133 --> 08:54.067
YOU DON'T NEED
YOUR FATHER'S CONSENT.

08:57.133 --> 08:59.700
I'M HMONG, AND MY FATHER
IS THE ELDER.

08:59.733 --> 09:01.633
IF HE SAYS I GO HOME,

09:01.667 --> 09:03.200
I GO HOME.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.100
HMONG? LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT THAT MEANS.
OKAY.

09:09.133 --> 09:11.067
CONTACT SOCIAL SERVICES.
SEE IF WE CAN GET

09:11.067 --> 09:12.767
SOMEBODY DOWN HERE
TO TALK TO HIM.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.700
DO I CONTINUE TO PROCESS
HER DISCHARGE?
YEAH, WE HAVE TO.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.633
IT'S INSANE, BUT WE HAVE TO.
IT REMINDS ME OF THIS CASE

09:16.667 --> 09:18.567
I HAD IN NEW YORK ONE TIME WHERE
THIS WOMAN CAME TO THE OFFICE--

09:18.600 --> 09:21.333
LOOK, DO YOU NEED ME FOR
ANYTHING ELSE WORK RELATED?

09:24.267 --> 09:26.600
LOOK, I WAS MARRIED
FOR 11 YEARS.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.800
ADDISON IS MY FAMILY.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.700
THAT IS 11 THANKSGIVINGS,
11 BIRTHDAYS AND 11 CHRISTMASES,

09:30.733 --> 09:32.767
AND IN ONE DAY, I'M SUPPOSED
TO SIGN A PIECE OF PAPER

09:32.800 --> 09:34.300
AND END MY FAMILY?

09:34.333 --> 09:35.633
A PERSON DOESN'T DO THAT--

09:35.667 --> 09:37.567
NOT WITHOUT
A LITTLE HESITATION.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.500
I'M ENTITLED TO A LITTLE
UNCERTAINTY HERE.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.433
JUST A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND
THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT IT MEANS

09:41.467 --> 09:43.367
TO CUT SOMEBODY OUT
OF MY LIFE.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.800
I'M ENTITLED
TO AT LEAST ONE MOMENT...
(door closes)

09:45.833 --> 09:47.733
OF PAINFUL DOUBT.

09:47.767 --> 09:51.133
AND A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING
FROM YOU WOULD BE NICE.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.333
DR. SHEPHERD,
STILL HERE, I SEE.

09:55.367 --> 09:56.700
I COULDN'T LEAVE YOU.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.633
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE OTHER DR. SHEPHERD?

09:58.667 --> 10:00.567
I'LL TELL HIM
YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR HIM.

10:00.600 --> 10:05.133
SO THANKS FOR, YOU KNOW,
BEING THERE.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.067
NO THANKS NEEDED.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.833
OKAY.
SO WHERE ARE WE?

10:08.867 --> 10:10.767
UH, THE NORTHEAST CORNER
OF THE HOSPITAL.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.667
OH, I-I'M GETTING BACK
ON MY FEET.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.167
FINE.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT--

10:15.200 --> 10:17.367
CRISTINA.
IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.267
I'M NOT WAITING FOREVER.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.233
***

10:21.267 --> 10:22.600
HEY, KAREV AND O'MALLEY

10:22.633 --> 10:24.533
ARE BRINGING UP A G.S.W.
YOU WANT TO SCRUB IN?

10:24.567 --> 10:25.733
NO CAN DO.
NO EXTRA WORK.

10:25.767 --> 10:28.800
I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE
AT A DECENT HOUR TONIGHT.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.733
WHAT, YOU GOT A DATE?
YES. YES, I DO.

10:30.767 --> 10:32.267
A HANDSOME MAN
IS WHISKING ME AWAY

10:32.300 --> 10:35.567
TO A LOVE NEST
FOR THE WEEKEND.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.833
YOU GOT SHOT
IN THE LINE OF DUTY?

10:38.867 --> 10:42.633
FIRST MONTH ON THE JOB.
CAN YOU BELIEVE MY LUCK?

10:42.667 --> 10:44.567
GUY PULLS A GUN,
AND I FREEZE UP

10:44.600 --> 10:46.500
THE ROOKIE LET HIMSELF
GET SHOT.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.400
I'M NEVER GONNA
LIVE THIS DOWN.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.333
SURE, YOU WILL.
YOU THINK?

10:50.367 --> 10:53.100
ABSOLUTELY.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.833
***

10:54.867 --> 10:57.100
HEY, I GOT VERNA BRADLEY'S
TESTS BACK.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.100
I DON'T THINK
SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.200
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THE CHANGES
IN HER E.K.G. SHE HAD SOMETHIN'.

11:01.233 --> 11:03.133
YEAH, BUT HER SERIAL ENZYMES

11:03.167 --> 11:05.067
AND DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHO
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.833
I ACTUALLY THINK SHE'S FINE.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.233
GET A CARDIAC CATH.
IZZIE, BE THOROUGH.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.600
I AM THOROUGH.

11:11.633 --> 11:13.533
(Alex) SO, DUDE,
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH IZZIE?

11:13.567 --> 11:15.433
SHE SHAVED HER LEGS
FOR YOU.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.667
AND?

11:16.700 --> 11:18.600
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
KISS HER GOOD NIGHT.

11:18.633 --> 11:20.533
SHE SHAVED HER LEGS FOR YOU,
AND YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH?

11:20.567 --> 11:22.467
HEY, I FOLLOW THROUGH.
I ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.200
YOU DIDN'T LAST NIGHT.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.400
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
MIND--

11:26.433 --> 11:29.333
SHE HAD EXPECTATIONS.
WOMEN HAVE EXPECTATIONS,

11:29.367 --> 11:33.100
AND YOU DIDN'T MEET THEM.
HEY, I LIVE WITH THESE WOMEN,

11:33.133 --> 11:34.633
AND EVERY TIME YOU GUYS
DON'T MEET THEIR EXPECTATIONS,

11:34.667 --> 11:36.167
I HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.100
I DIDN'T GET
ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.400
SO, YOU KNOW,
IT IS MY BUSINESS.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.600
(thud)

11:42.633 --> 11:44.133
(elevator screeches)

11:48.667 --> 11:51.267
DUDE, WE'RE NOT MOVING.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.633
REALLY? YA THINK?

12:02.367 --> 12:05.600
(Woman) DR. COLE, 2-6-2-1.
DR COLE, 2-6-2-1.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.100
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
A SURGICAL SCAR TAKES TO HEAL.

12:17.133 --> 12:19.567
YOU MUST BE IN PAIN.
YOU SHOULD TAKE SOMETHING.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.500
DRUGS ARE FOR BABIES.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.100
I HATE ALEX.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.067
AND THE NON SEQUITUR AWARD
GOES TO...

12:25.067 --> 12:27.733
I'M SORRY.
I HATE ALEX.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.567
I BROKE UP WITH DEREK.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.333
BURKE WANTS TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.

12:33.367 --> 12:35.600
BOYS ARE STUPID.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.267
YEP.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.100
"IF ELEVATOR SHOULD STOP,
DO NOT BECOME ALARMED.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.233
"PRESS THE BUTTON MARKED 'ALARM'
TO SUMMON ASSISTANCE."

12:46.267 --> 12:48.167
IF THEY DON'T WANT US
TO BE ALARMED,

12:48.200 --> 12:49.167
THEN WHY CALL THE BUTTON
"ALARM?"

12:49.200 --> 12:51.067
THAT DIDN'T WORK
THE LAST FIVE TIMES YOU DID IT.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.800
GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD.
WE'VE LOST POWER.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.700
WE'RE STUCK HERE.
OH.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.400
YOU OKAY?

12:56.433 --> 12:58.333
HIS PRESSURE'S FALLING.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.533
ALEX, THERE'S A LOT MORE
OF HIS BLOOD

13:00.567 --> 13:02.467
IN THE PLEUROVAC.
WE NEED TO GET HIM TO THE O.R.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.400
OKAY, YOU'RE WHISPERING.
DON'T WHISPER.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.067
I MEAN, LOOK, I DON'T
WANNA COMPLAIN HERE,

13:06.100 --> 13:07.333
BUT I GOT A BULLET
IN MY CHEST,

13:07.367 --> 13:09.467
AND WHISPERING
ISN'T A SIGN THAT

13:09.500 --> 13:11.400
I'M GOING TO BE A-OKAY,
YOU KNOW?
DAMN IT, IT'S OUT.

13:11.433 --> 13:14.800
IT'S BAD. IT'S BAD, RIGHT?

13:14.833 --> 13:17.167
SOMEONE'S GONNA GET US
OUT OF HERE. DON'T WORRY.

13:18.733 --> 13:20.333
HOW ARE WE DOING?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.267
OH, CAN YOU MOVE ME
TO ANOTHER ROOM?

13:22.300 --> 13:24.200
THE LIGHTS AND THE TV WENT OUT.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.633
POWER OUTAGE IN THE EAST WING.
THEY'LL HAVE IT BACK ON SOON.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.300
YOU'RE NOT A CRITICAL PATIENT.
YOU'LL BE FINE HERE.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.200
OH, GOD, WELL,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

13:31.233 --> 13:33.067
YOU MEAN...
WITHOUT MY PORN?

13:33.067 --> 13:35.300
READ A BOOK.
TALK TO YOUR WIFE.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.233
NO, SCHOOL CLOSED EARLY
BECAUSE OF THE STORM.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.167
SHE HAD TO PICK UP THE KIDS.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.600
SHE WON'T BE BACK
UNTIL AFTER DINNER.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.500
WELL, I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND

13:43.533 --> 13:46.567
SOME NORMAL WAY
OF AMUSING YOURSELF.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.567
I NEED MY PORN!

13:48.600 --> 13:50.200
YEAH.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.433
LIGHTNING HIT A SUBSTATION.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.800
WE'RE RUNNING
ON BACKUP GENERATORS.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.433
ONE OF THEM'S DOWN.
RICHARD, BREATHE.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.367
THE ONLY DIRECT MEANS
OF TRANSPORTING PATIENTS

13:56.400 --> 13:59.100
FROM THE E.R. TO THE O.R.
ISN'T WORKING.

13:59.133 --> 14:02.767
DON'T TELL ME TO BREATHE.
I'LL BREATHE IF I WANNA BREATHE.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.067
THE CAR'S BETWEEN FLOORS.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.800
(Richard)
HOW BAD IS IT?

14:05.833 --> 14:08.200
TWO INTERNS AND A G.S.W.
TO THE CHEST.

14:08.233 --> 14:12.200
GOOD AIR IN.
(exhales) BAD AIR OUT.

14:12.233 --> 14:15.067
COME ON, PEOPLE.
GET THOSE DOORS OPEN.

14:16.467 --> 14:19.200
(Man) IT'S JAMMED UP.
I WON'T OPEN ANYMORE.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.533
ALL RIGHT. MOVE, MOVE.
THIS IS AS WIDE
AS IT GOES.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.700
WHAT DID YOU TWO DO?

14:23.733 --> 14:24.800
NOTHING!
NOTHING!

14:26.667 --> 14:28.767
(Burke) HOW'S THE PATIENT?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.467
HE'S NOT LOOKING SO GOOD.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.167
WHY DO THE LIGHTS
KEEP FLICKERING?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.233
SOMETHING ABOUT
A BACKUP GENERATOR.

14:41.267 --> 14:43.700
THIS PUMP WILL PROVIDE YOU
WITH A MORPHINE DRIP,

14:43.733 --> 14:45.633
AND IT SHOULD STOP YOUR PAIN.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.567
I-I TOLD YOU
I DON'T NEED IT.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.833
I'M GOING HOME.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.767
YOU REALIZE YOU'LL HAVE TO SIGN
AN A.M.A. FORM STATING

14:52.800 --> 14:55.467
THAT YOU'RE LEAVING
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.
FINE.

14:55.500 --> 15:01.233
I KNOW THIS IS
NEW AND CONFUSING.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.167
I CALLED A SOCIAL WORKER,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.100
AND SHE'S WILLING TO COME DOWN
AND TALK TO YOU.

15:05.133 --> 15:07.333
SPARE ME YOUR WHITE GIRL
CULTURAL DIVIDE LOVE.

15:07.367 --> 15:09.533
I GREW UP DOWN THE STREET
FROM HERE. I PLAY IN A BAND.

15:09.567 --> 15:13.100
I WENT TO U-DUB. I GET IT.
BUT MY FATHER DOESN'T.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.533
HE SAYS NO, IT'S NO.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.200
ANNA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR ABILITY TO EVER WALK AGAIN.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.133
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.067
I'M TALKING ABOUT MY FAMILY.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.833
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN
HEARD OF THE HMONG PEOPLE?

15:24.867 --> 15:27.633
OUR RELIGION HAS GOT RULES
THAT ARE WAY OLD

15:27.667 --> 15:29.567
AND WAY SET IN STONE
AND WAY SPIRITUAL,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.567
AND YOU DON'T MESS WITH THEM.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.733
YOU DON'T
ANGER THE ANCESTORS...

15:34.767 --> 15:37.500
EVEN IF YOU PIERCE YOUR TONGUE
AND PLAY IN A BAND.

15:37.533 --> 15:40.667
WHAT ARE THE RULES EXACTLY?

15:43.733 --> 15:45.500
ALL I.C.U. PATIENTS ARE GOIN'
TO THE SOUTH WING.

15:45.533 --> 15:48.367
ALL TELEMETRY AND STEP-DOWN
PATIENTS, NORTH WING.
YOU PAGED ME.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.200
PORN AS PAIN MANAGEMENT?
YOU MET HENRY.
YEAH, THERE ARE

15:51.233 --> 15:53.167
A LOT OF DIFFERENT THEORIES
AS TO HOW TO TREAT PAIN.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.667
PORN AS PAIN MANAGEMENT?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.700
LOOK, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
PORNOGRAPHY, LIKE ART AND MUSIC,

15:57.733 --> 15:59.633
CAN STIMULATE THE BRAIN
TO PRODUCE ENDORPHINS

15:59.667 --> 16:01.300
THAT MINIMIZE PAIN.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.667
PORN AS PAIN MANAGEMENT.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.367
I DIDN'T PRESCRIBE IT.
IT WASN'T ME.
(pager beeps)

16:04.400 --> 16:06.267
TAKE IT UP WITH
THE TREATING PHYSICIAN.
YEAH.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.467
IF THAT MAN TURNS OUT
TO BE SOME SORT OF SEX WEIRDO,

16:08.500 --> 16:10.800
IT'S ON YOU.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYIN'.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.733
OH, AND YOUR WIFE'S
LOOKIN' FOR YOU.
I KNOW.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.267
DEREK.
YES.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.200
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO ANNA'S FATHER.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.567
I'D DO IT MYSELF,

16:17.600 --> 16:19.500
BUT I GUESS HAVING TESTICLES
IS A REQUIREMENT.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.067
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SOCIAL SERVICES?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.800
ACCORDING TO ANNA,
THEY CAN'T HELP US.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.333
APPARENTLY,
ANNA'S FATHER BELIEVES

16:24.367 --> 16:26.267
SHE'S MISSING SOMETHING
THAT SHE NEEDS FOR SURGERY.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.167
MISSING SOMETHING?
MISSING WHAT?

16:28.200 --> 16:30.100
ONE OF HER SOULS.

16:30.133 --> 16:32.433
WE DON'T NEED A SOCIAL WORKER.
WE NEED A SHAMAN.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.367
A SHAMAN?

16:34.400 --> 16:37.067
CARDIO TELLS ME YOUR CATH
WENT JUST FINE.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.233
IS THAT MUCH BRUISING NORMAL?

16:38.267 --> 16:40.600
YOUR WOUND LOOKS GOOD,
MRS. BRADLEY,

16:40.633 --> 16:42.100
AND SO DO THE RESULTS
ON YOUR CATH.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.800
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BLOCKAGE
IN YOUR ARTERIES.

16:43.833 --> 16:46.467
WHICH MEANS?
YOU DEFINITELY DID NOT HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.667
OH HO HO.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.133
SO I CAN GO HOME?

16:50.167 --> 16:52.333
NOT YET.
YOUR E.K.G. SHOWS

16:52.367 --> 16:54.100
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES,

16:54.133 --> 16:57.367
AND I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHY
BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.633
HEY, PETE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

17:01.667 --> 17:03.067
I HAVE TO GET HOME.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.600
PETE, YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:04.633 --> 17:05.833
I NEED TO GET HOME.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.800
I NEED TO GET HOME.
WHAT'S HIS BLOOD PRESSURE?

17:08.833 --> 17:10.667
IT'S NOT READING.
HE'S TOO AGITATED.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.300
HOW'S HIS PULSE?
IT'S THREADY,
BUT IT'S STILL THERE.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.300
DO YOU HAVE ANY INSTRUMENTS
IN THERE?
JUST THE CODE BOX
AND SOME GLOVES.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.067
YOU DIDN'T BRING
AN OPEN CHEST TRAY?
NO, WE THOUGHT--

17:19.100 --> 17:20.800
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR EXCUSES.
O'MALLEY, BLOOD PRESSURE.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.633
I'VE TAKEN IT THREE TIMES.
AND?

17:22.667 --> 17:24.133
I CAN'T HEAR
A SYSTOLIC OVER 50.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.200
HE'S GONNA DIE.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.567
INTUBATE HIM.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.467
WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO GET AN INSTRUMENT TRAY.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.433
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
OPEN UP HIS CHEST.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.333
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

17:45.367 --> 17:47.767
NO.

18:05.567 --> 18:09.267
WHEN'S BURKE COMING BACK?

18:11.233 --> 18:15.133
WHEN IS DR. BURKE
COMING BACK? ALEX?

18:15.167 --> 18:16.767
OH, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

18:19.667 --> 18:21.767
(thunder rumbles)

18:21.800 --> 18:24.667
MR. CHUE...

18:24.700 --> 18:26.767
YOU WANT TO TAKE ANNA HOME
FOR A HEALING RITUAL?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.700
WHEN SICKNESS COMES,
IT MEANS THAT

18:28.733 --> 18:30.367
ONE OF OUR SOULS
IS MISSING.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.300
ANNA NEEDS
TO HAVE HER SOULS INTACT

18:32.333 --> 18:35.100
BEFORE SHE HAS SURGERY.
SHE NEEDS A SHAMAN.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.067
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.200
WHY, SO YOU COULD
CALL ME A FOOL?

18:39.233 --> 18:41.100
I RESPECT THAT YOU HAVE
TRADITIONS

18:41.133 --> 18:42.733
THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND,

18:42.767 --> 18:45.400
BUT YOU'RE STANDIN' BESIDE ME
IN A $3,000 SUIT,

18:45.433 --> 18:47.467
SO I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU RESPECT
THE FACT THAT I'M TELLING YOU

18:47.500 --> 18:49.433
ANNA NEEDS THE SURGERY
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS

18:49.467 --> 18:51.333
IF SHE'S GOING TO CONTINUE
TO WALK.

18:51.367 --> 18:53.267
SHE CAN'T
LEAVE THIS HOSPITAL.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.333
SHE CAN'T UNDERGO SURGERY
WITHOUT HER SOUL. SHE'D DIE.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.733
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.667
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GET A SHAMAN--TODAY--

19:04.700 --> 19:06.067
IN THE HOSPITAL.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.133
SHAMANS AREN'T LISTED
IN THE YELLOW PAGES.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.067
OUR SHAMAN IS 500 MILES
FROM HERE.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.400
YOU ARE AN ARROGANT MAN.

19:12.433 --> 19:14.433
NO. I'M JUST A GUY
WITH ACCESS TO A HELICOPTER.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.500
THANK YOU.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.833
FINDING HER SOUL
WON'T BE EASY.

19:23.867 --> 19:25.767
IT NEVER IS.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.733
(Richard)
THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.667
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH POWER
TO MOVE THOSE ELEVATORS?

19:29.700 --> 19:31.200
THEY'RE DOIN' WHAT THEY CAN

19:31.233 --> 19:33.133
TO REPLACE
THE BACKUP GENERATOR NOW.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.067
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S
IS STANDING BY.
ALL CRITICAL PATIENTS?

19:35.100 --> 19:37.267
MOVED TO THE SOUTH WING.
INCOMING TRAUMA?

19:37.300 --> 19:40.100
REROUTED TO MERCY WEST.
THAT BACKUP GENERATOR SHOULD'VE
BEEN REPLACED LAST YEAR.

19:40.133 --> 19:42.100
YES, SIR.
WHY DIDN'T IT HAPPEN?

19:42.133 --> 19:44.067
CHIEF, YOU'D... HAVE TO
ASK MAINTENANCE.

19:44.067 --> 19:46.067
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

19:46.067 --> 19:48.667
DR. BAILEY,
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.833
TELL ME WHOSE BUTT
TO KICK.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.167
THAT WOULD BE
YOUR BUTT, CHIEF.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.100
YOU DIDN'T AUTHORIZE
THE REPLACEMENT GENERATOR,

19:55.133 --> 19:57.567
SAVING MONEY
FOR THE NEW M.R.I. MACHINE.

19:57.600 --> 20:03.200
UM... I NEED TO GET ON
BACK ON DOWN TO THE... O.R.

20:12.367 --> 20:14.100
HEY.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.167
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE
TOO STERILE,

20:16.200 --> 20:18.133
BUT WE CAN STILL TRY.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.667
PREP AND DRAPE
THE PATIENT.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.533
HEY, CAN YOU GET ME COPIES

20:50.567 --> 20:52.467
OF ALL VERNA BRADLEY'S
MEDICAL RECORDS?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.400
AND PAGE ME.
I'LL BE ON THE O.R. FLOOR.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.800
(Cristina) HEY, WHERE, UM,

20:56.833 --> 20:59.033
HEY, WHERE ARE
YOU TWO GOING SO FAST?

20:59.067 --> 21:00.800
BURKE IS TALKING
GEORGE AND ALEX

21:00.833 --> 21:02.733
THROUGH HEART SURGERY
IN THE ELEVATOR.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.667
SHEPHERD'S SETTING UP
A SHAMAN HEALING RITUAL.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.600
ROCK ON.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.200
I HAVE PORN GUY.

21:10.367 --> 21:11.633
HELP, PLEASE.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.400
MR. LAMOTT,
WHAT'S WRONG?

21:14.433 --> 21:15.333
(groans)

21:15.367 --> 21:18.333
YOUR PRESSURE'S ELEVATED.

21:18.367 --> 21:19.833
YOUR PULSE IS RACING.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.567
YOU'RE REALLY IN PAIN.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.067
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

21:23.100 --> 21:26.433
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THE PORN ACTUALLY SEDATED YOU?

21:26.467 --> 21:28.367
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I'M SOME KIND OF PERVERT,

21:28.400 --> 21:30.067
WATCHING THAT STUFF
IN FRONT OF YOU?

21:30.067 --> 21:32.167
WELL, YES.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.233
OH, OKAY. OKAY.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.167
YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO MOST NARCOTICS

21:38.200 --> 21:39.533
AND NSAIDS.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.800
I-I SUPPOSE, UH,
WE COULD TRY DROPERIDOL

21:42.833 --> 21:44.167
AND DIPHENHYDRAMINE.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.500
THAT PUT ME INTO A COMA
LAST YEAR.

21:46.533 --> 21:47.833
WELL, UM,

21:47.867 --> 21:49.767
I CAN GET
AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST DOWN HERE.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.700
OH, NO, BUT WITH
YOUR SURGERY TOMORROW,

21:51.733 --> 21:54.667
I DON'T THINK HE'LL GIVE YOU
AN EPIDURAL BLOCK.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

21:54.700 --> 21:57.333
UH, HOLD ON.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.067
WE'RE REALLY GONNA DO THIS?

22:11.600 --> 22:14.100
***

22:14.133 --> 22:15.500
TAKE THESE.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.133
KAREV, TAKE THE SCALPEL.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.133
ALEX, COME ON.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.700
ALEX.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.300
***

22:45.500 --> 22:47.467
VENTILATE.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.133
(George) I GOT IT.

22:59.067 --> 23:00.633
WHAT DO I DO?

23:00.667 --> 23:04.333
MAKE A LARGE ANTEROLATERAL
MIDAXILLARY INCISION

23:04.367 --> 23:07.067
IN THE FIFTH
INTERCOSTAL SPACE.

23:08.533 --> 23:11.067
HOW--HOW LARGE?

23:11.067 --> 23:12.400
(Burke) AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.667
YOU NEED TO GET
TWO HANDS IN THERE.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.667
IT NEEDS TO BE LONG
AND DEEP.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.367
USE THE SCISSORS
IF YOU HAVE TO.
OKAY.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.333
BUT BE SURE YOU DON'T CUT
INTO THE LUNG OR HEART.

23:23.367 --> 23:24.567
HOW CAN I BE SURE
OF THAT?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.367
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE SURE.

23:27.400 --> 23:32.067
***

23:36.767 --> 23:40.633
WE'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.

23:58.467 --> 24:00.733
YOUR SHAMAN'S LATE.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.533
MY SHAMAN IS NEVER LATE.

24:06.833 --> 24:07.867
(Izzie) CAN YOU GUYS
SEE ANYTHING?

24:07.900 --> 24:10.200
POOR GEORGE. HE DOESN'T HAVE
THE STEADIEST HANDS.

24:10.233 --> 24:11.167
IZZIE.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.133
YEAH.

24:12.167 --> 24:15.067
HE CAN HEAR YOU.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.600
(Burke) O'MALLEY...

24:16.633 --> 24:19.600
HOW YOU DOIN' DOWN THERE?

24:19.633 --> 24:22.200
UH,
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S HERE.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.333
THEY CAN GET THE DOORS OPEN.
NO. NOBODY MOVES.

24:24.367 --> 24:26.067
NOBODY WORKS ON THE ELEVATOR.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.267
I HAVE AN OPEN CHEST

24:27.300 --> 24:29.367
AND A VERY NERVOUS INTERN
IN THERE.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.167
KEEP THEM BACK
UNTIL I GIVE THE WORD.
OKAY, GUYS, WE'RE NOT...

24:32.200 --> 24:32.967
O'MALLEY...

24:33.067 --> 24:35.067
I DIDN'T CUT THE HEART
OR THE LUNGS.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.533
DR. BURKE, I DIDN'T CUT
THE HEART OR THE LUNGS.

24:37.567 --> 24:39.467
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD.
GOOD, O'MALLEY. REALLY GOOD.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.067
NOW CHECK FOR INJURIES
AND DO A PERICARDIOTOMY.

24:42.067 --> 24:44.400
I'LL NEED SOME LAP PADS,

24:44.433 --> 24:48.167
FORCEPS, METZENBAUMS
AND SATINSKY CLAMPS.

24:49.567 --> 24:52.133
YES, YOU WILL.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.133
YOU TELL ANYONE
I DID THIS FOR YOU,

24:54.167 --> 24:56.067
NOT ONLY WILL I KILL YOU,

24:56.100 --> 24:58.067
I WILL SELL YOUR BODY PARTS
FOR CASH.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.567
UH-HUH.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.067
OKAY. SO...

25:03.100 --> 25:05.800
THERE WERE THESE WOMEN--
NURSES--

25:05.833 --> 25:07.500
THREE NURSES--
MM-HMM.

25:07.533 --> 25:11.067
AND THEY WERE...
NAUGHTY.

25:11.067 --> 25:13.100
THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY NAUGHTY.

25:13.133 --> 25:14.533
THEY WERE THREE
NAUGHTY NURSES.

25:14.567 --> 25:16.467
SAUCY EVEN--
THEY WERE SAUCY

25:16.500 --> 25:19.200
AND BAD AND NAUGHTY.

25:19.233 --> 25:20.733
THREE SAUCY, BAD,
NAUGHTY NURSES--

25:20.767 --> 25:23.767
THEY WERE TAKING
A SHOWER TOGETHER.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.467
SOAPING EACH OTHER UP,

25:25.500 --> 25:27.767
AND THEN THIS DOCTOR
WALKS IN,

25:27.800 --> 25:31.233
AND HE SEES THESE THREE
NAUGHTY, BAD NURSES

25:31.267 --> 25:34.100
WITH THESE GREAT BIG...

25:34.133 --> 25:36.067
MRS. BRADLEY, DO YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU'VE BEEN

25:36.067 --> 25:37.800
ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL
ON THIS DATE

25:37.833 --> 25:40.067
FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS?

25:40.100 --> 25:41.067
OH, THAT CAN'T BE.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.100
I DON'T REMEMBER THE DATE
EXACTLY, BUT--

25:43.133 --> 25:44.600
I HAVE THE MEDICAL RECORDS.

25:44.633 --> 25:46.700
ON THIS DATE
FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS,

25:46.733 --> 25:48.633
YOU HAVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A HEART ATTACK.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.333
NO. NO.

25:50.367 --> 25:53.467
I KNOW I'VE HAD SOME SCARES,
BUT I DON'T--

25:53.500 --> 25:54.667
EVERY YEAR ON THIS DATE?

25:54.700 --> 25:58.600
IS THERE SOME SIGNIFICANCE
TO THIS DATE FOR YOU PERSONALLY?

25:58.633 --> 26:01.067
NO. NOTHIN'.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.800
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
THE FIRST YEAR,

26:02.833 --> 26:04.333
THE FIRST TIME YOU HAD
A CARDIAC EPISODE?

26:04.367 --> 26:06.300
OH, WHO CAN REMEMBER
BACK THAT FAR?

26:06.333 --> 26:08.633
WE WERE IN THE YARD. I REMEMBER
BECAUSE OUR NEIGHBOR--

26:08.667 --> 26:10.567
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
TED.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.733
THAT'S RIGHT. HE DIED.

26:12.767 --> 26:14.567
OF AN ANEURYSM, I THINK.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.567
AND WE WATCHED
AS THE FUNERAL HOME PEOPLE

26:16.600 --> 26:18.267
TOOK HIM AWAY,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.200
AND YOU HAD
YOUR FIRST ATTACK.

26:20.233 --> 26:22.267
AND YOU WERE CLOSE
TO TED?

26:22.300 --> 26:24.733
NO. OH, WE BARELY KNEW TED.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.267
WELL, THAT WAS ALL VERY SAD,

26:26.300 --> 26:28.833
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH VERNA'S HEART?

26:28.867 --> 26:32.200
***

26:33.500 --> 26:35.833
I REMOVED A SMALL CLOT
FROM THE PERICARDIUM.

26:35.867 --> 26:38.533
NO OBVIOUS CARDIAC INJURIES.

26:38.567 --> 26:40.367
ANY CHANGE IN THE VITALS?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.167
(Alex) B.P.'s STILL TOO LOW
TO REGISTER ON THE MONITOR.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.233
WE NEED TO CROSS-CLAMP
THE AORTA.

26:44.267 --> 26:47.133
***

26:47.167 --> 26:51.233
STICK YOUR HAND IN
AND BLUNTLY DISSECT DOWN

26:51.267 --> 26:53.500
UNTIL YOU FEEL
TWO TUBE-LIKE STRUCTURES.

26:53.533 --> 26:55.567
THE ESOPHAGUS WILL BE
MORE MEDIAL AND ANTERIOR.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.500
UM, I FEEL ONE TUBE
THAT'S EASILY COLLAPSIBLE,

26:58.533 --> 27:02.700
AND THE OTHER'S, UH,
MORE MUSCULAR

27:02.733 --> 27:04.367
AND SPONGY.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.800
I CAN FEEL THE SPINE
JUST UNDERNEATH IT.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.467
YES! YOU'RE TOUCHING
THE AORTA.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.167
I'M TOUCHING THE AORTA.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.200
WRAP THE INDEX FINGER
OF YOUR LEFT HAND AROUND IT

27:14.233 --> 27:17.100
AND APPLY A SATINSKY CLAMP
WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND.

27:17.133 --> 27:20.567
***

27:22.733 --> 27:24.533
GOT IT.

27:24.567 --> 27:27.400
WAIT, I-I THINK
I CAN LOCALIZE THE BLEEDING.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.600
I THINK IT'S COMING FROM
THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.167
CAN YOU FIND THE LESION?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.133
YEAH.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.300
YEAH, I THINK I CAN FEEL IT.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.233
IT'S TOO FAR IN
TO REPAIR.

27:37.267 --> 27:38.833
HOW BIG IS IT?
SMALL.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.467
MAYBE SMALLER THAN A DIME.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.533
OKAY, O'MALLEY, I WANT YOU
TO TAKE YOUR FINGER

27:44.567 --> 27:46.467
AND PLUG THE HOLE.

27:47.800 --> 27:52.100
I THINK I CAN FEEL HIS HEART
STARTING TO FILL MORE.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.167
IT'S BEATING
A LITTLE STRONGER.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.300
EXCELLENT.
KEEP YOUR FINGER THERE.
OKAY. NOW WHAT?

27:57.333 --> 27:59.267
THAT'S IT.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.800
THAT'S IT?

28:04.067 --> 28:05.567
(George) I JUST STAND HERE

28:05.600 --> 28:07.500
WITH MY FINGER
PLUGGING THE HOLE?

28:07.533 --> 28:09.433
UNTIL WE CAN GET YOU
OUT OF THAT ELEVATOR

28:09.467 --> 28:11.133
AND INTO THE O.R.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.400
DR. BAILEY,

28:12.433 --> 28:16.133
YOU CAN TELL THE FIREMEN
TO GET MY GUYS OUTTA THERE.
WILL DO.

28:16.167 --> 28:19.067
OKAY, WE'RE READY.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.267
O'MALLEY.

28:20.300 --> 28:21.600
YES, SIR.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.800
YOU JUST FLEW SOLO.

28:25.533 --> 28:28.533
THANK YOU, SIR.

28:28.567 --> 28:31.800
***

28:38.333 --> 28:41.067
OKAY, ANNA, WE'RE GONNA
SHUT OFF THE P.C.A. PUMP NOW,

28:41.100 --> 28:42.433
WHICH MEANS YOU'LL BE
IN A LOT OF PAIN

28:42.467 --> 28:43.833
FOR THE DURATION OF THE--

28:43.867 --> 28:45.200
THE HEALING RITUAL.

28:45.233 --> 28:46.733
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

28:46.767 --> 28:50.633
YEAH. I CAN'T FIND MY SOUL
IF I'M MEDICATED.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.667
NO PAIN, NO GAIN, RIGHT?

28:52.700 --> 28:55.467
IT'S NOT JUST FOR YOUR FATHER.
YOU BELIEVE IT, TOO, RIGHT?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.400
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
LIKE A LOAD OF CRAP,

28:57.433 --> 28:59.367
BUT WATCH THE RITUAL,
YOU'LL SEE.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.600
SEE WHAT?

29:00.633 --> 29:02.800
THE MOMENT IT HAPPENS.

29:05.433 --> 29:08.333
***

29:21.300 --> 29:24.500
I'M READY.

29:29.867 --> 29:33.800
"OH, YES, I'M SO VERY,
VERY NAUGHTY,"

29:33.833 --> 29:34.800
BIANCA SAID

29:34.833 --> 29:37.433
AS SHE, UH, DROPPED
HER STETHOSCOPE.

29:37.467 --> 29:39.833
"ME, TOO," SAID CRYSTAL

29:39.867 --> 29:42.167
AS SHE SNAPPED ON
HER SURGICAL GLOVE,

29:42.200 --> 29:45.400
AND THEN THERE WAS MARTA...

29:54.567 --> 29:55.733
WHERE WAS I?

29:55.767 --> 29:57.700
MARTA.

29:57.733 --> 30:00.367
OH, YES. MARTA WAS
THE NAUGHTIEST NURSE OF ALL

30:00.400 --> 30:02.267
BECAUSE SHE KNEW HOW TO--

30:02.300 --> 30:03.467
(Woman giggling)

30:03.500 --> 30:05.167
OH, THANK GOD.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.367
(giggling continues)

30:06.400 --> 30:07.700
(Man) WE'RE BACK UP.

30:07.733 --> 30:10.633
***

30:17.600 --> 30:19.500
HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK IT TAKES

30:19.533 --> 30:21.633
TO RETRIEVE A LOST SOUL?

30:26.300 --> 30:28.433
I DON'T KNOW.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.500
WAY TO GO, GEORGE.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.500
I HAVE MY FINGER
IN A HEART.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.333
VERY COOL.

30:34.367 --> 30:37.267
***

30:47.433 --> 30:49.600
YOU HAVE
STRESS CARDIOMYOPATHY.

30:49.633 --> 30:53.133
CARDIOMYOPATHY? WHAT--CAN YOU
TELL ME WHAT THAT IS?

30:53.167 --> 30:54.600
IT'S TED.

30:54.633 --> 30:57.133
TED?

30:57.167 --> 30:58.467
TED.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.667
NOT JUST A NEIGHBOR
YOU BARELY KNEW, WAS HE?

31:00.700 --> 31:03.333
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:03.367 --> 31:05.267
BECAUSE EVERY YEAR
ON THE DAY HE DIED,

31:05.300 --> 31:08.100
YOU GET A RUSH OF ADRENALINE
CAUSED BY STRESS.

31:08.133 --> 31:12.233
YOUR PRESSURE RISES,
YOU HAVE CHEST PAINS...

31:12.267 --> 31:15.200
AND YOU END UP HERE.

31:16.433 --> 31:19.567
27 YEARS...

31:19.600 --> 31:24.200
I LOVED THE MAN NEXT DOOR
AND HE LOVED ME.

31:24.233 --> 31:26.600
I KNOW
HOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND...

31:26.633 --> 31:29.233
TED WAS MY SOUL MATE.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.333
AND THEN HE JUST DIED.

31:34.367 --> 31:36.400
IT'S GRIEF.

31:36.433 --> 31:38.100
YOUR HEART STOPS

31:38.133 --> 31:40.367
BECAUSE YOU'RE GRIEVING
FOR TED.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.767
SO...

31:42.800 --> 31:44.300
WHAT DO I DO NEXT?

31:44.333 --> 31:47.767
I MEAN,
HOW DO YOU TREAT IT?

31:50.600 --> 31:53.400
I WISH I KNEW.

31:53.433 --> 31:56.333
***

32:31.133 --> 32:33.600
I TOLD THATCH
I'M LEAVING HIM.

32:33.633 --> 32:35.600
YOU LEFT THATCHER, ELLIS.

32:35.633 --> 32:38.467
BUT I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO LEAVE ADELE.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.400
DO YOU REMEMBER?

32:42.467 --> 32:44.467
PAINTED HORSES...

32:44.500 --> 32:47.133
YES.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.067
WE WERE ON THE CAROUSEL
IN THE PARK.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.800
IT WAS RAINING.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.800
I HAVE AN OFFER
FROM BOSTON GENERAL.

32:52.833 --> 32:55.067
YOU TOOK IT TO GET AWAY.

32:55.067 --> 32:56.800
WE SWORE
WE'D NEVER TALK AGAIN

32:56.833 --> 32:58.733
ABOUT WHAT WE HAD TOGETHER.

32:58.767 --> 33:01.200
IT WAS GONNA ALWAYS BE
OUR SECRET.

33:01.233 --> 33:02.167
RICHARD...

33:02.200 --> 33:05.300
YES, ELLIS.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.600
CAROUSELS GIVE ME
THE CREEPS.

33:10.433 --> 33:12.233
HOW DO YOU PUT UP
WITH IT?

33:12.267 --> 33:15.333
I MEAN,
"NASTY, NAUGHTY NURSES 4,"

33:15.367 --> 33:17.333
AND I'M ASSUMING
1, 2 AND 3?

33:17.367 --> 33:18.633
HE'S MY HENRY.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.567
I KNOW,
BUT DON'T YOU FIND IT

33:20.600 --> 33:22.467
MISOGYNISTIC AND DEGRADING
AND KIND OF...

33:22.500 --> 33:27.700
24 HOURS A DAY OF PORN?
SERIOUSLY, THAT'S YOUR LIFE?

33:27.733 --> 33:30.367
I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT.
IT TAKES AWAY HIS PAIN.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.267
AND SEE, THE THING IS,

33:32.300 --> 33:35.800
HENRY--HENRY TAKES AWAY
MY PAIN.

33:35.833 --> 33:38.733
***

34:41.133 --> 34:42.467
I LIED.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.367
I'M NOT OUT
OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.767
I'M IN. I'M SO IN
IT'S HUMILIATING

34:47.800 --> 34:49.300
BECAUSE HERE I AM
BEGGING--

34:49.333 --> 34:51.133
MEREDITH, JUST--
SHUT UP.

34:51.167 --> 34:53.067
YOU SAY "MEREDITH,"
AND I YELL, REMEMBER?

34:53.067 --> 34:53.833
YEAH.

34:53.867 --> 34:55.400
OKAY...

34:55.433 --> 34:57.500
HERE IT IS.

34:57.533 --> 34:59.667
YOUR CHOICE, IT'S SIMPLE--

34:59.700 --> 35:02.200
HER OR ME.

35:02.233 --> 35:04.633
AND I'M SURE
SHE'S REALLY GREAT.

35:04.667 --> 35:08.200
BUT, DEREK, I LOVE YOU...

35:08.233 --> 35:12.167
IN A REALLY, REALLY BIG...

35:12.200 --> 35:14.367
PRETEND TO LIKE YOUR TASTE
IN MUSIC,

35:14.400 --> 35:17.100
LET YOU EAT THE LAST PIECE
OF CHEESECAKE,

35:17.133 --> 35:19.833
HOLD A RADIO OVER MY HEAD
OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW,

35:19.867 --> 35:22.267
UNFORTUNATE WAY
THAT MAKES ME HATE YOU

35:22.300 --> 35:23.633
LOVE YOU.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.167
SO PICK ME.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.467
CHOOSE ME.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.067
LOVE ME.

35:33.433 --> 35:35.333
I'LL BE AT JOE'S TONIGHT,

35:35.367 --> 35:38.700
SO IF YOU DO DECIDE
TO SIGN THE PAPERS...

35:38.733 --> 35:41.433
MEET ME THERE.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.200
GOOD-BYE, ELLIS.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.133
I AM GONNA COME
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

36:18.167 --> 36:19.733
OKAY?

36:19.767 --> 36:22.133
HE DOESN'T LOVE HER.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.567
HE CAN'T.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.500
BUT HE'LL STAY
WITH HER ANYWAY.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.300
SHE'S HIS WIFE.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.500
MOM?

36:34.433 --> 36:35.767
MOMMY?

36:35.800 --> 36:38.733
MEREDITH...

36:38.767 --> 36:40.100
YOU GREW UP.

36:40.133 --> 36:41.600
I DID.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.100
HMM. IT'S A SHAME.

36:44.133 --> 36:46.600
IT'S AWFUL
BEING A GROWN-UP.

36:46.633 --> 36:49.067
BUT THE CAROUSEL
NEVER STOPS TURNING.

36:50.533 --> 36:52.567
YOU CAN'T GET OFF.

36:56.067 --> 36:58.367
OKAY.

37:02.767 --> 37:06.767
***

37:10.533 --> 37:12.367
YOU THINK HE'LL SHOW?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.533
HE'LL SHOW.

37:18.167 --> 37:20.233
(bell on door jingles)

37:20.267 --> 37:21.300
HEY.

37:21.333 --> 37:25.067
***

37:29.800 --> 37:31.433
HOW'S YOUR PATIENT?

37:31.467 --> 37:33.367
THE ONE THAT GOT
HER SOUL BACK?

37:33.400 --> 37:35.433
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

37:35.467 --> 37:36.767
HEY. GOTTA GO.

37:36.800 --> 37:39.233
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU LOOK LIKE A GIRL.

37:39.267 --> 37:40.300
IS THAT YOUR DATE?

37:40.333 --> 37:41.833
IT'S MY HUSBAND.

37:41.867 --> 37:43.200
YOU'RE MARRIED?

37:43.233 --> 37:44.733
TEN YEARS TODAY.

37:44.767 --> 37:47.400
HOW COME I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.167
YOU NEVER ASKED.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.533
YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED
THOSE DIVORCE PAPERS YET,

37:53.567 --> 37:55.567
HAVE YOU?

37:55.600 --> 37:57.333
BAILEY...

37:57.367 --> 37:58.433
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

37:58.467 --> 38:00.433
(laughs)

38:00.467 --> 38:03.067
GOD. WHY DOES THIS
HAVE TO BE SO HARD?

38:03.100 --> 38:04.267
IT'S NOT HARD.

38:04.300 --> 38:07.133
IT'S PAINFUL,
BUT IT'S NOT HARD.

38:07.167 --> 38:09.067
COME ON, YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO ALREADY.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.267
IF YOU DIDN'T,

38:10.300 --> 38:12.600
YOU WOULDN'T BE
IN SO MUCH PAIN.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.733
PAIN--

38:21.767 --> 38:23.667
YOU JUST HAVE TO
RIDE IT OUT,

38:23.700 --> 38:26.267
HOPE IT GOES AWAY
ON ITS OWN,

38:26.300 --> 38:28.333
HOPE THE WOUND
THAT CAUSED IT HEALS.

38:28.367 --> 38:31.133
SO...
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.

38:31.167 --> 38:33.067
I WORK TOO MUCH,
I'M COMPETITIVE,

38:33.100 --> 38:34.600
I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.

38:34.633 --> 38:35.800
AND I SNORE.

38:35.833 --> 38:37.233
WHAT?

38:38.533 --> 38:40.467
I'M TRYING HERE.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.400
OH. OH.

38:42.433 --> 38:44.233
OH! OH.

38:44.267 --> 38:46.733
YEAH.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.700
SO?

38:51.300 --> 38:53.500
WHATEVER. DON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.500
THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS,

39:07.533 --> 39:10.167
NO EASY ANSWERS.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.600
YOU JUST BREATHE DEEP
AND WAIT FOR IT TO SUBSIDE.

39:13.633 --> 39:16.167
OH, MAN!
I JUST--I CAN'T--

39:16.200 --> 39:18.133
(bell on door jingles)

39:18.167 --> 39:21.733
***

39:21.767 --> 39:23.167
HE'S NOT COMING.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.667
YOU DON'T THINK
HE'S COMING.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.200
HE MIGHT COME.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.500
YEAH. YOU NEVER KNOW.

39:31.533 --> 39:32.500
HE'S DEFINITELY COMING.
(kicks George under bar)

39:32.533 --> 39:35.067
OW! YOU WANT HER DOING
TEQUILA SHOTS ALL NIGHT?

39:35.100 --> 39:36.833
I'LL BE THE ONE
CLEANING UP THE VOMIT.

39:36.867 --> 39:39.767
BESIDES, I TOUCHED
A HEART TODAY...

39:39.800 --> 39:41.067
PORNY.

39:43.367 --> 39:45.200
(bell on door jingles)

39:51.333 --> 39:53.267
MOST OF THE TIME,
PAIN CAN BE MANAGED.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.167
POUR ME ANOTHER ONE.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.200
BUT SOMETIMES,
THE PAIN GETS YOU

40:00.233 --> 40:01.700
WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT...

40:01.733 --> 40:05.100
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
ANY SECOND.

40:05.133 --> 40:07.800
HITS WAY BELOW THE BELT

40:07.833 --> 40:09.467
AND DOESN'T LET UP.

40:09.500 --> 40:13.600
***

40:13.633 --> 40:17.567
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.833
WELL...

40:20.867 --> 40:22.200
YOU FOUND ME.

40:22.233 --> 40:23.333
SO...

40:23.367 --> 40:27.133
YOU GONNA SIGN
THOSE DIVORCE PAPERS OR NOT?

40:27.167 --> 40:28.600
***

40:28.633 --> 40:30.533
PAIN--

40:30.567 --> 40:32.467
YOU JUST HAVE TO
FIGHT THROUGH

40:32.500 --> 40:35.467
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS,
YOU CAN'T OUTRUN IT

40:35.500 --> 40:38.667
AND LIFE ALWAYS MAKES MORE.

40:38.700 --> 40:41.600
