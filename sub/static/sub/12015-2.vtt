00:01.055 --> 00:04.735
My brother went missing when he was
five years old. Never seen him since.

00:04.895 --> 00:07.175
<i>There's a case
that I'm working on, and er...</i>

00:07.335 --> 00:09.295
<i>They found blood,
but it's not the victim's.</i>

00:09.455 --> 00:11.895
<i>The DNA, it's Jesse. He's alive.</i>

00:12.055 --> 00:14.135
- We're gonna get our boy back.
- It's a mistake.

00:14.295 --> 00:16.775
- So you're saying he's a murderer?
- Nobody knows.

00:16.935 --> 00:19.335
Don't you think there's someone else
we should tell,

00:19.495 --> 00:20.735
<i>someone who was with us that day?</i>

00:20.895 --> 00:22.615
- <i>Pru.</i>
- How long's it been?

00:22.775 --> 00:24.455
- 16 years.
- Here we are.

00:24.615 --> 00:25.935
<i>The four of us grown up.</i>

00:26.095 --> 00:29.295
This is my husband Stuart.
He's a workaholic.

00:29.455 --> 00:32.095
- I really missed you, over the years.
- Me, too.

00:33.215 --> 00:34.935
I'm here to help you.

00:35.095 --> 00:37.295
- <i>I run a shelter for runaways.</i>
- What's the story?

00:37.455 --> 00:40.535
- She disappeared five years ago.
- Were you held against your will?

00:40.695 --> 00:42.535
I'm not the only one.
There are more.

00:42.695 --> 00:44.415
Make sure she's OK,
help her settle in.

00:44.575 --> 00:46.295
<i>Where is she?</i>

00:46.455 --> 00:47.855
Hey, Brit!

00:48.015 --> 00:51.455
Got a trace on the mobile from
the murdered woman. Name's Annie Green.

00:52.815 --> 00:54.255
Are you Jesse?

00:58.015 --> 01:01.935
We call this the Platinum Hall.

01:03.575 --> 01:06.775
You want to know the great myth
about creativity?

01:07.495 --> 01:10.015
The big lie they always tell you:
"It has to take time.

01:10.175 --> 01:12.815
It has to be slaved over."

01:12.975 --> 01:16.215
When I wrote "Lucky Girl" for Belinda,
I forgot she was coming.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.215
She turned up on Tuesday. I thought
she was coming on a Wednesday,

01:19.375 --> 01:20.975
so I told her to go and get a coffee.

01:21.135 --> 01:24.455
I went into the studio
and I wrote the lyrics.

01:24.615 --> 01:26.975
They took me five minutes.

01:28.855 --> 01:32.815
<i>♪ Lucky boy came into my world ♪</i>

01:32.975 --> 01:36.615
<i>♪ Lucky boy made everything swirl ♪</i>

01:36.775 --> 01:39.135
<i>♪ I-I-I-I ♪</i>

01:39.295 --> 01:41.495
<i>♪ I'm a lucky girl ♪</i>

01:44.015 --> 01:47.375
This... is where the magic happens.

01:49.815 --> 01:51.695
I've found my new magician.

01:51.855 --> 01:54.575
The neighbours don't complain,
with all this noise going on?

01:54.735 --> 01:57.495
- Dad!
- It's totally soundproofed.

01:57.655 --> 02:01.175
Make as much noise in here as you
like and nobody can hear a thing.

02:01.335 --> 02:02.815
Just watch this.

02:21.615 --> 02:22.775
<i>Voilà.</i>

02:25.295 --> 02:26.895
Real, real pleasure. Thank you, Dad.

02:27.055 --> 02:29.175
She's in good hands,
don't you worry about her.

02:29.335 --> 02:31.135
Take care.
I'll see you very soon in there.

02:31.295 --> 02:32.695
All right.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.255
Take care.

03:57.175 --> 03:59.615
So, Annie Green's mobile is
registered to an address

03:59.775 --> 04:02.735
that doesn't exist anymore, got
ripped down a couple of years back.

04:02.895 --> 04:05.175
- Knocked down.
- Totally erased.

04:07.055 --> 04:09.495
That's helpful. Where are
they sending the bills?

04:13.135 --> 04:15.775
A shrug -
that's what you've got for me?

04:15.935 --> 04:16.935
Hey, I'm on it.

04:19.255 --> 04:20.935
Don't touch the suit.

04:25.495 --> 04:26.895
Danny.

04:27.055 --> 04:28.895
Hey. Sorry for calling so early.

04:29.055 --> 04:31.455
We've made an arrest
in the murder enquiry.

04:31.615 --> 04:33.695
<i>We traced a mobile
that was stolen at the scene.</i>

04:33.855 --> 04:36.055
<i>When we went to locate it,
a man did a runner.</i>

04:36.215 --> 04:37.815
- Is it him?
- <i>Nah.</i>

04:37.975 --> 04:39.695
He won't talk till
he gets a solicitor.

04:39.855 --> 04:41.455
We asked his name,
he said it was Hugh.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.495
<i>Fuck Hugh.</i>

04:43.655 --> 04:45.895
What does he look like?
Does he look like Jesse?

04:46.055 --> 04:47.935
<i>Mark, the last time I saw him,
he was five.</i>

04:48.095 --> 04:50.935
OK, well, is he the right age?

04:52.095 --> 04:54.135
- <i>Danny?</i>
- Yeah.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.575
<i>What's his hair colour?
Does he...</i>

04:56.735 --> 04:58.895
Does he have any freckles?

04:59.055 --> 05:00.775
Come on, man.

05:00.935 --> 05:02.935
<i>We ran his prints
and they came back clean.</i>

05:03.095 --> 05:06.375
So he has no criminal record, but
we won't release him till we know.

05:06.535 --> 05:08.775
- I'm going to come down there.
- No, Mark...

05:08.935 --> 05:10.495
let us interview him.

05:10.655 --> 05:13.015
I need to keep personal
and professional apart.

05:13.175 --> 05:16.095
- He's my brother, Danny.
- <i>Mark, please, stay home.</i>

05:16.255 --> 05:18.215
<i>I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.</i>

05:18.375 --> 05:21.535
Don't tell your mum. She's calling
me ten times a day as it is.

05:27.135 --> 05:28.775
They've made an arrest.

05:28.935 --> 05:32.055
Could be Jesse, could not be.
We're just going to have to sit tight.

05:33.055 --> 05:35.495
Let me guess whether
you're going to do that.

05:35.655 --> 05:37.455
It could be Jesse, Dad.

05:37.615 --> 05:39.655
Does that not interest you?

05:42.295 --> 05:44.135
I'll make the coffee to go.

06:41.455 --> 06:42.495
Jesse!

06:50.695 --> 06:54.135
So, are you gonna tell us
your name now...

06:54.295 --> 06:55.615
Hugh?

06:59.695 --> 07:01.575
Joe Hanley.

07:03.695 --> 07:05.095
OK.

07:06.655 --> 07:08.455
So, Joe...

07:09.175 --> 07:11.015
have you ever changed your name?

07:11.935 --> 07:14.615
- Changed my name?
- Yeah, when you were born.

07:14.775 --> 07:17.615
Were you born as someone else,
someone who isn't Joe Hanley?

07:17.775 --> 07:18.855
No.

07:19.015 --> 07:20.535
Have you lived round here long?

07:20.695 --> 07:23.415
- Or...
- All my life, on and off.

07:23.575 --> 07:24.855
On and off?

07:25.015 --> 07:28.295
Yeah, I mean, I travelled, I went to
uni. Sorry, why is he asking this?

07:28.455 --> 07:30.575
My client wants to know
why you're asking that.

07:30.735 --> 07:32.415
It relates to a murder enquiry.

07:32.575 --> 07:35.015
I'd advise your client
to answer the question.

07:35.815 --> 07:37.415
You should answer that.

07:37.575 --> 07:39.735
I've answered it. On and off.

07:40.535 --> 07:43.335
What are the names of your mother
and father?

07:44.375 --> 07:45.295
What?

07:45.455 --> 07:49.495
Sorry, you think I nicked a phone,
which I didn't.

07:49.655 --> 07:51.975
What have my mum and dad
got to do with it?

07:52.135 --> 07:53.895
Do you want to ask him?

07:54.895 --> 07:57.335
- My client wants...
- I heard.

08:03.615 --> 08:05.695
Dorothy and James.

08:08.175 --> 08:09.415
All right.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.855
OK, let's talk about this phone.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.535
Can you tell us how this iPhone 5,
registered to a Miss Annie Green,

08:17.695 --> 08:18.935
came into your possession?

08:19.095 --> 08:21.215
- I found it.
- You found it. Where?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.655
- At a Lebanese restaurant.
- Did you tell anyone you found it?

08:24.815 --> 08:27.975
- No.
- Nah. So, basically, you stole it.

08:28.135 --> 08:32.095
Look, I've obviously wandered
into something here.

08:32.255 --> 08:34.455
You're telling me this phone's
linked to a murder.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.135
I don't know anything about that.

08:36.294 --> 08:39.775
I picked up a phone, turned it on
to see who it belonged to.

08:39.934 --> 08:43.215
I was about to return it, next thing
you lot are outside the restaurant.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.415
Yeah, well, we came
to ask you some questions.

08:45.575 --> 08:47.215
But before we could do that,

08:47.375 --> 08:49.695
you kind of ran off and
then hit my partner in the face.

08:49.855 --> 08:50.815
And it hurt.

08:52.295 --> 08:56.015
Hardly the behaviour of someone
who's got nothing to hide, is it...

08:56.175 --> 08:57.695
Joe?

08:58.855 --> 09:00.495
Wouldn't you say?

09:02.455 --> 09:04.095
All right, all right.

09:04.255 --> 09:07.935
Look... the thing is,
if you want the truth...

09:09.615 --> 09:11.455
I work for an accountancy firm.

09:11.615 --> 09:13.815
A big one - Hanson and Finch.

09:14.895 --> 09:18.735
If I get done for theft,
that's my job down the drain.

09:18.895 --> 09:20.535
OK?

09:20.695 --> 09:23.575
For a stupid mistake,
I'm facing the abyss.

09:23.735 --> 09:26.535
Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy,
but I was scared.

09:26.695 --> 09:29.775
I'm still scared because now you
think I'm wrapped up in a murder.

09:29.935 --> 09:31.775
This is a living hell.

09:34.935 --> 09:37.815
So you wouldn't mind
giving us a DNA sample?

09:42.455 --> 09:44.295
I want my proper brief.

10:00.055 --> 10:02.935
Yeah?

10:04.975 --> 10:06.215
Oh, hi.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.975
Hi.

10:08.135 --> 10:10.135
Sorry, I'll be one sec. OK?

10:12.815 --> 10:15.015
I haven't seen you for years,

10:15.175 --> 10:18.095
then, all of a sudden,
you can't keep away from me.

10:18.255 --> 10:20.215
Well, I was worried about her.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.455
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you make your excuses.

10:23.615 --> 10:24.975
How is she?

10:25.135 --> 10:27.575
Well, physically,
I mean, she'll be fine, but...

10:27.735 --> 10:30.415
Slade, we have to tell her parents.
They have a right to know.

10:30.575 --> 10:32.975
- Is that what she wants?
- What, to go home?

10:34.015 --> 10:36.935
I think she trusts me.
She's started to speak a little.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.535
Saying what?

10:38.695 --> 10:40.935
Not much, but she's scared,
she can't sleep,

10:41.095 --> 10:43.215
afraid someone's gonna come
and get her.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.855
She said something about
being chained to a wall.

10:46.015 --> 10:47.615
She has to be home.

10:47.775 --> 10:49.735
Somewhere she knows she's safe.

10:49.895 --> 10:52.855
All right, yeah.
OK, I can sort that out, but...

10:53.015 --> 10:56.415
ask her,
make sure that's what she wants.

10:56.575 --> 11:00.135
A lot of the kids I deal with here,
their problems start at home.

11:00.295 --> 11:02.655
They hate home, OK?
That's not safety.

11:02.815 --> 11:04.815
OK, I'll leave you to it.

11:04.975 --> 11:07.615
Oh, hang on. Erm...

11:07.775 --> 11:11.175
have you noticed she's got
these marks on her neck,

11:11.335 --> 11:13.935
like these freaky
little vampire bites?

11:14.095 --> 11:16.135
- Yeah, I've noticed.
- What is that?

11:16.295 --> 11:17.975
It's worrying.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.375
Have you seen Britnay?

11:20.535 --> 11:21.895
Not recently.

11:23.655 --> 11:24.935
Right.

11:26.095 --> 11:29.695
He's a man who made a mistake and
his first call is to Dean Frankell.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.695
He says he works for Hanson
and Finch. Could be big money.

11:32.855 --> 11:34.775
He'll need it. That guy charges
by the nanosecond.

11:34.935 --> 11:37.655
- I take it he's got a reputation.
- They call him The Weasel.

11:37.815 --> 11:39.615
He's small,
but extremely aggressive.

11:39.775 --> 11:41.215
And he goes for the jugular.

11:41.375 --> 11:44.255
I've had a few by this point,
eight, nine pints.

11:44.415 --> 11:48.175
I look at her and say, "Excuse me,
is your dad a baker? Cause you have..."

11:48.335 --> 11:51.535
- Are you busy, chaps?
- Oh, always. Hey, Ally.

12:02.335 --> 12:04.135
Are you trying to get me fired?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.815
What do you think?

12:31.775 --> 12:33.815
I-I-I need more time.

12:37.455 --> 12:39.135
So...

12:41.855 --> 12:43.855
have you had a look?

12:45.255 --> 12:48.175
Jesse's eyes were brown
like chocolate buttons.

12:49.775 --> 12:51.775
His are kind of muddy.

12:58.495 --> 13:00.095
We're erm...

13:01.135 --> 13:04.015
I've ordered an age progression
photo for Jesse.

13:04.175 --> 13:06.655
But what would really help
is if we had some photos

13:06.815 --> 13:10.055
of you at the age
that Jesse would be now.

13:10.215 --> 13:12.935
Do you reckon you could
dig some out for us?

13:23.135 --> 13:24.895
Is that the murder victim?

13:26.735 --> 13:29.815
Yeah.
It's a woman called Annie Green.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.415
We think she's possibly
a prostitute.

13:33.455 --> 13:36.575
- Is that all you know?
- Yeah.

13:36.735 --> 13:39.575
So, Jesse could have been with her,
then, in the hotel.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.335
He could have been
screwing a hooker.

13:41.495 --> 13:44.015
Yeah, I mean, there are
all kinds of possibilities.

13:44.175 --> 13:46.415
Most obvious being
that he's a murderer.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.295
Or that this whole thing's
a mistake.

13:48.455 --> 13:50.655
Jesse's what I think he is,
he's dead.

13:52.815 --> 13:54.775
Alan, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.575
Let me just check
the coast is clear.

14:08.375 --> 14:12.815
The night the murder took place,
Wednesday 15th April,

14:12.975 --> 14:17.055
my client was at a work function -
an accountancy dinner.

14:17.215 --> 14:20.455
The event which took place
at the Gramercy Hotel,

14:20.615 --> 14:22.375
Farringdon Lane,
was very well attended.

14:22.535 --> 14:24.135
I'm sure you won't have any trouble

14:24.295 --> 14:26.295
finding any number
of people more than happy

14:26.455 --> 14:28.775
to provide a rock solid alibi.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.175
- We'll check.
- Do.

14:30.335 --> 14:31.415
- We will.
- Good.

14:31.575 --> 14:33.815
However, there is another issue,

14:33.975 --> 14:36.175
and it concerns my client's arrest.

14:37.935 --> 14:38.895
I'm listening.

14:39.055 --> 14:42.055
My client claims that
he was assaulted during the arrest,

14:42.215 --> 14:44.655
dragged to the floor and spat on.

14:44.815 --> 14:48.175
- He elbowed me in the face.
- In self-defence.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.775
- He was in fear of his life.
- Bullshit!

14:50.935 --> 14:52.735
- He knew we were the police!
- Ally.

14:52.895 --> 14:55.535
My understanding is
that the purpose of the arrest

14:55.695 --> 14:59.375
was to ascertain how my client
acquired the mobile telephone,

14:59.535 --> 15:02.775
not the arrest of a murder suspect.

15:02.935 --> 15:06.495
So, if you didn't have an arrest
warrant, which you didn't,

15:06.655 --> 15:09.095
and you didn't have
reasonable suspicion

15:09.255 --> 15:13.255
that my client was the perpetrator
of the murder, which you didn't,

15:13.415 --> 15:19.495
why, may I ask, did you send
seven police officers

15:19.655 --> 15:23.615
to arrest him,
and then assault him in the street?

15:26.015 --> 15:29.975
Unless you can come up with something
inventive to charge him with,

15:30.135 --> 15:32.255
I'd like my client released...

15:32.415 --> 15:35.975
P.D.Q.

15:41.535 --> 15:43.855
Slade, isn't this a bit gruesome?

15:44.015 --> 15:47.215
Oh, they're not babies, Pru.
They've seen worse than this.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.735
I promise you that.

15:49.735 --> 15:51.335
Right, then.

15:51.495 --> 15:52.735
Are you OK?

15:52.895 --> 15:54.735
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

15:54.895 --> 15:56.415
Whose idea do you think this was?

15:56.575 --> 15:59.615
Take those, pass them round,
they're not the nicest photo, I know.

15:59.775 --> 16:02.655
Her name is Annie Green.
Take a good look, please.

16:02.815 --> 16:05.975
So, if any of you recognise her,
any information would be useful.

16:06.135 --> 16:09.655
- And she worked the streets?
- Yeah, we think so, yeah.

16:09.815 --> 16:11.175
Are you a cop?

16:11.335 --> 16:14.215
- Oi, cloth ears, I've told you.
- I'm not, I'm a lawyer.

16:14.375 --> 16:17.895
- Why are you doing cop work?
- It's about his brother, you see.

16:18.055 --> 16:20.615
We're just trying to find out
more about her.

16:20.775 --> 16:22.575
So, if any of you recognise her.

16:22.735 --> 16:25.975
Listen, we're not going to go
to the police or give your names out.

16:26.135 --> 16:28.935
This is strictly between these walls.

16:29.095 --> 16:30.175
OK?

16:32.055 --> 16:34.815
No? OK. Worth a shot.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.855
- Slade?
- Yeah?

16:39.015 --> 16:40.415
They're here.

16:40.575 --> 16:43.095
Right. You get Gemma.
I'll get the parents.

16:43.255 --> 16:44.455
Sure.

16:45.735 --> 16:48.775
Remember, she hasn't seen
her parents in five years.

16:49.935 --> 16:52.735
I'll be here...
be here with you the whole time.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.255
OK?

17:36.455 --> 17:39.775
- You'll get your moment.
- Course you will.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.695
Right, I'd better be off.

17:41.855 --> 17:43.735
I hope she's gonna be OK.

17:43.895 --> 17:46.255
- Right, see you later.
- Bye.

17:46.415 --> 17:48.015
Bye-bye.

17:48.175 --> 17:50.815
Look, we should go
for another drink some time.

17:50.975 --> 17:52.935
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- Yeah. Me too.

17:55.015 --> 17:57.295
- All three of us.
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.335
- Bye.
- See you later.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.335
Bye.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.495
She doesn't want me there.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.775
She's not a prossie.

18:10.895 --> 18:12.415
Do you know her?

18:12.575 --> 18:15.735
No, I don't know her.
But I've seen her.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.055
She gets coffee from Starbucks
on Raylan Street.

18:18.215 --> 18:20.855
I used to graft there sometimes.
She was a good giver.

18:21.015 --> 18:22.655
It doesn't mean she wasn't
a prostitute

18:22.815 --> 18:24.295
cause she was a good tipper, right?

18:24.455 --> 18:26.615
She was a smart dresser.
No way was she a whore.

18:26.775 --> 18:28.895
She wasn't dressed smart
when they found her.

18:29.055 --> 18:32.175
- And her name wasn't Annie Green.
- OK. You know her name?

18:32.335 --> 18:33.855
She's called Selena.

18:34.015 --> 18:36.175
- How do you know that?
- They write it on the cup.

18:36.335 --> 18:39.295
And my guess is she lived
in the apartments opposite

18:39.455 --> 18:41.975
because that's where she would
always head back towards.

18:42.135 --> 18:43.815
- Selena.
- OK.

18:43.975 --> 18:46.375
- OK.
- And...

18:46.535 --> 18:50.415
that information has got
to be worth a donation.

18:53.135 --> 18:54.615
Sure.

18:54.775 --> 18:56.935
- Here you are, mate.
- Thank you.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.535
That's the poshest homeless kid
I've ever seen.

18:59.695 --> 19:01.975
You should go and check that out.

19:34.495 --> 19:36.775
<i>Mark Wells Solicitors.
How may I help?</i>

19:36.935 --> 19:39.295
- <i>Hey, Larry.</i>
- Hello, stranger.

19:39.455 --> 19:42.735
<i>You have a million messages.
When will you be in?</i>

19:42.895 --> 19:45.975
I need some information on a woman
called Selena Callaway.

19:46.135 --> 19:49.055
- Selena or Serena?
- <i>Selena with an L.</i>

19:49.215 --> 19:51.455
Selena with an L.

19:56.015 --> 19:59.975
OK, there's a Selena Callaway
that works at Porter & Starr.

20:00.135 --> 20:04.015
<i>IT consultants.
There's also a link to her boss.</i>

20:04.175 --> 20:06.735
A guy called Nigel Freeman.
Want me to email the address?

20:06.895 --> 20:09.135
- Yeah, do it.
- <i>OK, Bye.</i>

20:17.415 --> 20:19.775
- Where is she?
- Just look after her.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.655
Brit!

20:25.215 --> 20:27.055
<i>Hi, you've reached Britnay's
voicemail.</i>

20:27.215 --> 20:29.975
<i>Leave your name and number and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

20:30.135 --> 20:32.535
<i>Thank you. Bye.</i>

20:32.695 --> 20:34.215
Brit, it's me.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.295
<i>Listen, you know my philosophy</i>

20:36.455 --> 20:39.135
<i>about running away
from your problems.</i>

20:39.295 --> 20:40.695
<i>Don't you?</i>

20:41.855 --> 20:47.175
<i>They're like elite athletes. They've
got sponsorship deals with Nike</i>

20:47.335 --> 20:50.495
<i>and they'll catch you in the end.</i>

20:50.655 --> 20:52.135
<i>So...</i>

20:52.975 --> 20:55.655
<i>whatever it is,
we're better facing it.</i>

20:57.695 --> 21:01.335
<i>Take some time, if you like,
but, please, call me.</i>

21:01.495 --> 21:02.975
<i>OK?</i>

21:33.295 --> 21:34.375
Julie.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.495
Update me.
Are you any closer to finding him?

21:37.655 --> 21:40.655
Julie, Julie, you can't keep
calling me like this.

21:40.815 --> 21:43.375
<i>You'll know,
the moment I get any information.</i>

21:43.535 --> 21:45.455
Am I an inconvenience, Danny?

21:45.615 --> 21:46.855
<i>He's my son.</i>

21:47.015 --> 21:50.575
My son. And you were there.
We are linked by this.

21:50.735 --> 21:53.135
<i>If I want to call you
a hundred times a day,</i>

21:53.295 --> 21:55.335
I'll call you a hundred times a day.

22:15.455 --> 22:18.855
You're such an amateur.
I can get you in there, no problem.

22:19.015 --> 22:21.015
- You'd get me past security?
- Simple.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.215
- How?
- Trust me.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.215
What am I doing?

22:25.375 --> 22:28.575
I'm chasing round town, showing
people photos of a dead woman.

22:28.735 --> 22:30.375
I'm... I'm losing my mind.

22:30.535 --> 22:33.135
You're just trying to get
some answers, that's all.

22:33.295 --> 22:35.295
It's obsessing me.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.975
Jesse, he's everywhere I look.

22:39.135 --> 22:41.935
Is that him? Is that him?

22:42.095 --> 22:44.335
I'd find it worrying
if it didn't obsess you.

22:44.495 --> 22:46.775
I guess. But...

22:47.455 --> 22:50.255
I keep on having this thought.
Erm...

22:51.295 --> 22:54.215
that if Jesse does turn out
to be a murderer...

22:54.775 --> 22:57.295
would I rather if he was dead?

23:08.375 --> 23:09.935
Group hug?

23:11.575 --> 23:15.135
- We're not in America now.
- Get that down you, then.

23:25.935 --> 23:27.375
I'm here, I'm here.

23:28.055 --> 23:29.575
Leave me alone.

23:30.895 --> 23:33.975
<i>Slade, what are we going to do?
Suppose Jesse tells?</i>

23:34.135 --> 23:37.735
<i>He won't. I'll make sure of it.
And neither will we.</i>

23:37.895 --> 23:40.855
<i>We tell no one. OK?</i>

23:42.855 --> 23:44.735
Oh!

23:52.775 --> 23:56.415
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, it's Gemma. I'm sorry to call.</i>

23:56.575 --> 23:59.255
No, no.
That's why I gave you my number.

23:59.415 --> 24:01.855
<i>Can we meet right away?</i>

24:03.815 --> 24:06.455
<i>You have one new message.</i>

24:06.615 --> 24:11.295
<i>Hi, Slade, it's me.
Thanks for your message.</i>

24:11.455 --> 24:13.455
<i>You were right, as ever.</i>

24:14.695 --> 24:17.655
<i>I've done a lot of thinking
and decided how to deal with it.</i>

24:18.975 --> 24:21.655
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

24:24.175 --> 24:27.335
<i>Hi, Slade, it's me.
Thanks for your message.</i>

24:27.495 --> 24:29.535
<i>You were right, as ever.</i>

24:30.775 --> 24:34.175
<i>I've done a lot of thinking and
decided how to deal with it.</i>

24:35.535 --> 24:38.375
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

24:45.015 --> 24:45.935
Britnay!

24:59.495 --> 25:01.935
I thought you'd done
something stupid, Brit.

25:02.095 --> 25:03.655
I'm sorry.

25:09.295 --> 25:11.535
Do you want to know
who kidnapped Gemma?

25:14.455 --> 25:15.895
I did.

25:19.215 --> 25:22.855
The reason I ran the other night,
when I saw Gemma...

25:24.335 --> 25:26.455
Because I recognised her.

25:32.335 --> 25:33.855
The guy who took her...

25:36.255 --> 25:38.495
the guy who held her captive...

25:42.535 --> 25:44.255
I helped him.

25:45.575 --> 25:47.375
I was held...

25:50.055 --> 25:52.175
in a room with the other girls.

25:53.895 --> 25:55.375
A big house.

25:59.335 --> 26:00.655
He...

26:02.935 --> 26:05.335
only let me out at night.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.535
He put a...

26:11.815 --> 26:14.015
dog collar round my neck.

26:15.215 --> 26:17.415
Some kind of electric one.
It would...

26:17.575 --> 26:19.295
Shock us...

26:19.455 --> 26:21.255
if we did things he didn't like.

26:21.775 --> 26:23.215
The marks.

26:26.495 --> 26:29.135
He always had a favourite.

26:30.415 --> 26:32.495
A girl he would take out with him.

26:32.655 --> 26:34.535
What do you mean, take out?

26:34.695 --> 26:36.975
That's how he'd capture his victims.

26:37.135 --> 26:39.735
He always had a girl with him
when he approached them.

26:39.895 --> 26:44.255
You're more likely to trust a man
when he's with a girl, aren't you?

26:44.775 --> 26:46.455
That's how he caught me.

26:47.295 --> 26:48.895
<i>Did you know who this man was?</i>

26:50.455 --> 26:52.095
What did he look like?

26:54.735 --> 26:56.255
Fat.

26:56.855 --> 26:58.095
<i>Chubby.</i>

26:59.135 --> 27:01.055
Flash clothes.

27:01.975 --> 27:03.655
He used to sing.

27:04.895 --> 27:07.095
I was so happy to get out.

27:07.855 --> 27:11.895
He let me talk to this girl
and make friends with her.

27:12.055 --> 27:15.775
I felt like me again
for the first time in...

27:20.895 --> 27:22.335
He grabbed her.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.655
Did you have any idea
where the house was?

27:25.815 --> 27:28.295
I could see a shadow in the yard.

27:29.495 --> 27:32.455
A building... shaped like a...

27:33.495 --> 27:35.815
an upside-down umbrella.

27:37.015 --> 27:39.495
I think the house had a swing set.

27:39.655 --> 27:42.575
Rusted, kind of old. It made a...

27:43.975 --> 27:46.655
It made a creaking noise
when it moved.

27:47.095 --> 27:50.255
Next time I said I didn't want
to do it.

27:51.655 --> 27:54.615
I said I didn't want anyone else
to get hurt, but...

27:55.495 --> 27:57.975
he hurt me until I agreed.

27:59.535 --> 28:01.775
Even then I tried to warn her.

28:04.855 --> 28:06.655
But it was too late.

28:07.855 --> 28:10.175
He started taking me out.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.735
He'd drive to a beauty spot.

28:16.575 --> 28:19.255
Somewhere remote.

28:20.975 --> 28:23.015
Set up a picnic.

28:24.775 --> 28:27.735
It was like a date or something
and then he'd...

28:34.135 --> 28:35.975
<i>Every day.</i>

28:36.135 --> 28:39.055
I hate myself for what I've done.

28:42.335 --> 28:44.735
Because no matter what I do...

28:46.255 --> 28:48.735
no matter who I help...

28:50.295 --> 28:52.735
it's never going
to erase what I did.

28:53.735 --> 28:56.215
I knew the hardest part would be
getting out of the car,

28:56.375 --> 28:58.335
but if I made it out...

29:00.615 --> 29:02.655
I didn't know where I was.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.055
I just knew I had
to get away from him.

29:10.495 --> 29:13.295
And thank God Slade saved me.

29:13.455 --> 29:15.495
<i>We've all done things...</i>

29:16.415 --> 29:18.375
to survive and to cope,

29:20.055 --> 29:21.455
all of us.

29:23.455 --> 29:27.055
And you went through hell
and you are a victim.

29:27.215 --> 29:28.495
OK?

29:31.895 --> 29:34.215
Then why doesn't it feel like it?

29:35.735 --> 29:39.415
Gemma, I know you're scared.

29:40.455 --> 29:44.095
I've got a friend, Danny,
and we can trust him.

29:44.935 --> 29:47.375
And if I come with you,
will you just talk to him

29:47.535 --> 29:49.695
and tell him what you've told me?

29:50.975 --> 29:53.175
Because this man needs to be caught.

29:53.335 --> 29:55.215
OK? For the sake of the others.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.415
And I'll be with you.

30:01.975 --> 30:04.375
I'll be with you, Gemma.

30:37.775 --> 30:40.575
This is massive. You should have
come to me straight away.

30:40.735 --> 30:42.975
She didn't want that.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.615
I'm going to go to my boss.
We'll get a team assembled.

30:46.775 --> 30:48.415
Look, I brought her to you

30:48.575 --> 30:50.855
because I promised her
that she could trust you.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.215
I'm going to get someone to help.
Pru...

30:53.375 --> 30:55.095
Pru, this is serious.

30:55.255 --> 30:56.895
What about the house?

30:57.055 --> 31:00.975
Do you think they'll find it?
Upside-down umbrella seems specific.

31:01.495 --> 31:05.815
Look, they'll do a search.
A case like this, it'll be a priority.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.535
I'll do my best to keep across it.

31:29.455 --> 31:32.255
Obviously, there's been
a mistake somewhere.

31:32.415 --> 31:35.695
- Mummy!
- Hey, baby.

31:38.135 --> 31:40.255
A conference call to Miami.
I'll be ten to 15.

31:41.055 --> 31:42.895
Let's go through them one by one.

31:43.055 --> 31:44.415
Hi.

32:18.615 --> 32:21.295
- Are you sure about this?
- Just go with it.

32:23.015 --> 32:26.975
- It's not going to work.
- You underestimate the word "rodents".

32:27.135 --> 32:29.495
Good morning, good morning.
How are you?

32:29.655 --> 32:33.175
I got a call from a Nigel Freeman
from Porter & Starr.

32:33.335 --> 32:36.375
Sounds like he's got our old friend,
the Norwegian Black.

32:42.135 --> 32:44.215
- Thirteenth floor.
- Thank you.

32:56.255 --> 32:57.735
Mr Freeman.

32:57.895 --> 33:00.855
- What's this all about?
- Can we have a quick word?

33:01.575 --> 33:04.615
- Murdered?
- Any grievances you knew about,

33:04.775 --> 33:06.735
any disagreements
she had with someone?

33:06.895 --> 33:10.935
She was a normal woman.
Well, as normal as anyone else.

33:11.095 --> 33:14.735
She liked to drink. She had
a problem with the off-switch.

33:15.815 --> 33:19.015
She was good-looking.
She attracted a lot of men.

33:19.175 --> 33:21.535
- Did she have a boyfriend?
- She played around.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.015
But half the office does.

33:24.855 --> 33:27.215
She was on that site. The online...

33:27.375 --> 33:29.135
Er... Timber.

33:29.295 --> 33:30.615
- Tinder.
- Yeah.

33:31.775 --> 33:33.655
I'm familiar with it.

33:33.815 --> 33:35.655
She was always looking
at some guy's photo,

33:35.815 --> 33:37.735
deciding whether she would
or she wouldn't.

33:37.895 --> 33:40.215
I thought the whole thing
was rather primitive.

33:40.975 --> 33:43.735
- Sorry, no offence.
- Non taken.

33:44.695 --> 33:48.055
Did she go on the site as herself,
Selena Callaway,

33:48.215 --> 33:50.375
or did she have an alias?

33:51.215 --> 33:53.695
You know, a nom de plume,
anything?

33:53.855 --> 33:57.535
So, the name Annie Green
doesn't mean anything to you?

34:00.615 --> 34:01.495
Annie Green?

34:02.855 --> 34:04.255
What is it?

34:04.815 --> 34:07.255
Annie Green is my ex-fiancée.

34:31.614 --> 34:35.014
- My God, look at that!
- Sshh!

34:56.695 --> 35:00.095
Bagels with cream cheese.
Yours has got that chive shit in it.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.895
Five years, Ally.

35:03.055 --> 35:05.095
Held against their will.

35:06.895 --> 35:08.495
Are you all right?

35:08.655 --> 35:10.575
I don't know.

35:11.695 --> 35:16.215
DNA from a kid missing for 20 years
suddenly turns up at a crime scene.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.935
And then a few days later, Gemma,
who's been missing for five years,

35:20.095 --> 35:21.735
suddenly reappears.

35:23.135 --> 35:25.855
What are you saying,
that the two are connected?

35:27.415 --> 35:30.495
I'm saying we shouldn't be sitting
here, eating cream cheese bagels.

35:42.175 --> 35:43.815
How many, do you think?

35:43.975 --> 35:47.055
- What?
- Girls?

35:47.215 --> 35:50.255
That Gemma,
she said there were more.

35:51.575 --> 35:53.615
You hear those horror stories
from America.

35:54.695 --> 35:58.335
And Switzerland.
Girls just kept for years.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.975
What kind of man does that?

36:18.535 --> 36:19.575
OK.

36:20.295 --> 36:21.775
Hilary Clinton...

36:23.295 --> 36:24.975
Kiera Knightley,

36:25.135 --> 36:26.735
JK Rowling.

36:27.335 --> 36:28.855
That's easy.

36:29.015 --> 36:31.615
Kill. Kill slowly.

36:32.375 --> 36:35.135
Marry then kill.
That way I'd get her money.

36:35.295 --> 36:36.695
Play properly.

36:38.135 --> 36:41.815
Look, I'm a married man with three
kids, so I'd shag any of 'em.

36:41.975 --> 36:43.775
Danny, are you sure
we should be doing this?

36:45.615 --> 36:46.695
What?

36:47.575 --> 36:50.175
Some of the lads are saying,
and don't bite my head off,

36:50.335 --> 36:53.135
they're saying because your dad
led the initial investigation

36:53.295 --> 36:54.975
into Jesse's disappearance...

36:56.335 --> 36:58.895
maybe you're out
to prove something.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.135
They think wrong, then, don't they?

37:05.695 --> 37:06.615
What?

37:06.775 --> 37:08.975
- Stop the car.
- What is it?

37:09.135 --> 37:11.655
Look, over there,
behind the tree line.

37:16.615 --> 37:18.455
Upside-down umbrella.

37:20.255 --> 37:22.615
OK, let's split up. You go down
there, I'll go down here.

37:22.775 --> 37:24.575
Remember, we're looking
for a swing set.

37:24.735 --> 37:25.735
OK.

38:30.135 --> 38:33.215
- Jesus!
- Having fun?

38:33.375 --> 38:36.375
Did you do that on purpose?
You just took a year off my life.

38:36.535 --> 38:37.895
Security cameras.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.935
Locked passage gate.

38:41.815 --> 38:45.295
Swing set.

38:45.455 --> 38:48.535
Right, let's go round the front,
see if anyone's in.

38:54.735 --> 38:57.975
Hello? Hi! Sorry to disturb you.

38:58.495 --> 39:00.775
We're police. DS Kenwood, DC Caine.

39:00.935 --> 39:04.055
- Mind if we ask about your neighbour?
- About him?

39:04.215 --> 39:06.415
- Yeah, do you know him?
- He's my neighbour. Why?

39:06.575 --> 39:08.975
- Do you know his name?
- What's he done?

39:09.135 --> 39:10.935
Oh, we're just following up a lead.

39:11.575 --> 39:14.655
His name's Jay Newman.
He's a music producer, or used to be.

39:14.815 --> 39:17.455
Had a hit way back with "Lucky Girl".
Belinda Salt?

39:18.695 --> 39:21.575
You're too young to remember,
but you should. It's:

39:21.735 --> 39:23.135
<i>♪ Lucky boy ♪</i>

39:23.295 --> 39:25.335
<i>♪ Came into my world ♪</i>

39:25.495 --> 39:29.135
<i>♪ Lucky boy,
made everything swirl ♪</i>

39:29.295 --> 39:31.335
<i>♪ I-I-I ♪</i>

39:31.495 --> 39:33.535
<i>♪ I'm a lucky girl ♪</i>

39:36.055 --> 39:38.735
- No, I don't know it.
- It was massive.

39:38.895 --> 39:41.055
- Probably paid for this place.
- I really don't.

39:41.215 --> 39:42.975
It had this mad synth section
halfway through.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.455
You haven't noticed
anything suspicious?

39:52.615 --> 39:55.175
To be honest, I rarely see him.
He doesn't go out much.

39:55.335 --> 39:57.255
He even walks his dogs
in the yard at night.

39:57.415 --> 40:00.415
He doesn't take 'em out properly,
which I think is cruel, but...

40:00.575 --> 40:03.575
- OK, well, thank you.
- He's not a pedo, is he?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.695
You'd tell me if he was a pedo?

40:05.855 --> 40:08.735
You have nothing to worry about,
really. Thank you.

40:13.135 --> 40:15.535
I'm going to have that song
in my head all day now.

40:15.695 --> 40:17.655
It sounds terrific.
I must buy a copy.

40:17.815 --> 40:20.695
What? For your gramophone?

40:20.855 --> 40:23.175
- What?
- You mean, download it.

40:23.335 --> 40:27.295
It was a glib remark, Ally. I didn't
realise it had to be contemporary.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.735
We should get a warrant.

40:31.895 --> 40:34.095
Especially after that balls-up
with Hanley.

40:34.255 --> 40:36.495
You're probably right.
Let's get it signed off.

40:39.055 --> 40:41.455
- Can I help you?
- Jay Newman?

40:41.615 --> 40:43.295
The one and only.

40:43.455 --> 40:45.335
We're police.
DS Kenwood, DC Caine.

40:45.495 --> 40:48.255
Do you mind if we come in,
ask you a few questions?

40:48.415 --> 40:50.855
- Regarding?
- Probably be better inside.

40:53.415 --> 40:55.215
Well, be my guests.

40:56.255 --> 40:57.655
Come on.

40:57.935 --> 41:00.735
<i>We're looking into the
disappearance of some local girls.</i>

41:00.895 --> 41:02.815
Well, I can assure you
the only girls

41:02.975 --> 41:05.815
that come through here
are future recording artists.

41:05.975 --> 41:10.295
Feel free to have a look around.
All you'll find is pop paraphernalia.

41:10.455 --> 41:13.895
Call it obsessive.
We all have our things, don't we?

41:16.175 --> 41:19.695
Let me show you
where the magic happens.

41:19.855 --> 41:21.655
Come with me.

41:28.375 --> 41:32.295
This... is the nerve centre.

41:33.175 --> 41:35.655
Let me show you something.

41:35.815 --> 41:38.735
Actually, you guys go in.
I'll be right there.

41:38.895 --> 41:40.935
So, this is the recording booth.

41:41.095 --> 41:43.655
Mark, it's not a great time.

41:43.815 --> 41:46.055
Oh, OK. Look,
I just want to tell you,

41:46.215 --> 41:48.015
you know the dead woman,
Annie Green?

41:48.175 --> 41:49.935
Slade and I have done
a bit of digging.

41:50.095 --> 41:51.335
Digging? Oh, great.

41:51.495 --> 41:52.935
<i>So, when did you two become cops?</i>

41:53.095 --> 41:55.255
Or have you just set up
as a pair of private dicks?

41:55.415 --> 41:58.015
Completely sound proof.

41:58.175 --> 42:00.575
- So, you know the song?
- Erm...

42:00.735 --> 42:02.375
<i>Actually, we got a lead
from the shelter.</i>

42:02.535 --> 42:04.375
One thing just led to another.

42:04.535 --> 42:08.615
<i>But I think we found something
that you might want to know.</i>

42:09.215 --> 42:12.495
OK. Meet me back at the station.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

42:12.655 --> 42:16.495
<i>♪ Lucky boy came into my world ♪</i>

42:16.655 --> 42:19.335
<i>♪ Lucky boy made everything swirl ♪</i>

42:19.495 --> 42:23.175
Ally. Erm... you've got
a swing set outside.

42:23.655 --> 42:27.175
- Have you got kids, or...?
- No, no, it's for the artists.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.135
The security cameras
make sense and the gates.

42:46.295 --> 42:48.615
I mean, all the recording gear
he's got in there.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.775
We'll come back with a warrant.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.775
You're still suspicious?

42:52.935 --> 42:55.535
The house doesn't have a basement.
Where would he keep them?

42:55.695 --> 42:58.095
Did you hear anything when we were
in there? Any noises?

42:58.255 --> 43:01.175
- No, like what?
- Like dogs barking, padding around?

43:01.335 --> 43:04.455
No. The whole house.
No dog bowls, no dog food.

43:04.615 --> 43:06.815
No dog smell.
That man does not keep dogs.

43:06.975 --> 43:08.775
So, why does his neighbour
think he does?

43:08.935 --> 43:10.695
So, what are you saying?

43:10.855 --> 43:13.975
Gemma, she had those marks
on her neck, remember?

43:15.015 --> 43:16.615
From a dog collar.
