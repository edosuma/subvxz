Hi, Chris.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.454
( breathing heavily )

00:37.538 --> 00:39.081
H-Hi, Barbara.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.916
I'm having a birthday party
next week.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.125
I was hoping
you could come.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.544
Oh, no!

00:43.627 --> 00:45.337
Someone peed
in my pants!

00:45.420 --> 00:46.505
( giggling )

00:46.588 --> 00:47.673
You're funny.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.508
Well, I hope
you can make it.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.554
Your friend's
birthday party

00:53.637 --> 00:54.805
sounds like
fun, Chris.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.223
Yeah, but I hope
for your sake

00:56.306 --> 00:58.183
the cake's better
than the last party I went to.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.853
( screaming )

01:00.936 --> 01:01.979
Oh, God!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.355
Coconut.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.732
I want to get Barbara
a really nice gift.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.485
What kind of gifts
have boys gotten for you, Meg?

01:08.569 --> 01:11.655
Oh... well, my boyfriend,
Prince William

01:11.738 --> 01:15.033
got me this beautiful watch
and this diamond tiara

01:15.117 --> 01:16.994
and this wonderful scepter.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.996
( tearful laughter )

01:20.080 --> 01:22.749
( sobbing )

01:22.833 --> 01:25.961
She needs to get laid, big time.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.254
Listen, Chris,
I read a book

01:27.337 --> 01:28.881
saying that women
are from Venus.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.549
All right, so here's
what you get her:

01:30.632 --> 01:33.594
thick layers of sulfuric acid,
viscous surface rock and coronae

01:33.677 --> 01:36.013
which seem to be collapsed domes
over large magma chambers.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.222
Here's five dollars.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.932
Well, that's okay, Dad.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.018
I was thinking
about getting a paper route

01:41.101 --> 01:43.061
so I could pay
for Barbara's gift myself.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.439
Oh, well, I think
that's very sweet, honey.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.441
Oh, boy, I remember
my first job.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.318
I was in a folk music trio.

01:49.401 --> 01:52.279
Hey, how about "Here's To You,
Mrs. Fleckenstein?"

01:52.362 --> 01:53.989
Yeah. You've been
pitching that for an hour

01:54.072 --> 01:55.657
but it's just not a
very attractive name.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.992
Oh, oh, fine, fine!

01:57.075 --> 01:58.577
And I-I suppose
we're also not going

01:58.660 --> 01:59.870
with "parsley,
sage, rosemary

01:59.953 --> 02:01.455
and Lowry's
Seasoning Salt"?

02:01.580 --> 02:02.706
( scoffs )

02:02.789 --> 02:04.082
That's it.
I'm going to 'Nam.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.631
Well, hey, there,
young fella.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.716
Bringing me good news today?

02:12.799 --> 02:13.842
What?

02:13.926 --> 02:15.594
Come on over here, son.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.430
Hand me the paper so I
don't need to use my grabber.

02:18.514 --> 02:21.850
Mm. That's a nice muscley
throwing arm you got there.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.477
Uh, thanks.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.104
Got a nice tip for you
right here in my pocket

02:26.188 --> 02:27.648
but my arthritis...

02:27.731 --> 02:30.651
Why don't you reach in there
and fish it out for yourself?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.277
Oh, that's okay, mister.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.404
I don't collect till
the end of the month.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.906
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.990
( quietly ): Weird.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.162
I hope you like it.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.455
Wow! Perfume!

02:43.539 --> 02:45.123
That is so sweet.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.543
It'll make you smell
like Elizabeth Taylor.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.669
I guess that means

02:48.752 --> 02:50.671
you'll smell like
bourbon and Vicodin.

02:50.754 --> 02:51.755
That's very thoughtful.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.423
Can I spray some on you?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.842
Ow! My eyes!

02:54.925 --> 02:56.260
They're beautiful.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.096
Oh, just get away
from me, Chris!

02:59.179 --> 03:01.890
( sobbing ):
I'm so awkward!

03:05.060 --> 03:06.186
Hey, Muscley Arm.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.021
Why the long face?

03:08.105 --> 03:09.189
Oh, it's this girl.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.108
I can't talk to her.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.735
It's like girls are a different species
or something.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.362
Aw, who needs them?

03:15.445 --> 03:16.947
You like Popsicles?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.073
Well, sure.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.366
Then, you need
to come on down

03:19.449 --> 03:20.450
to the cellar.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.828
I got a whole freezer
full of Popsicles.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.162
Mmm...

03:24.288 --> 03:26.206
No, thanks,
I got to get going.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.666
Oh, don't make me beg now.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.876
( laughs )

03:28.959 --> 03:30.878
You're funny. Bye.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.298
Get your fat ass back here.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.555
This is a holdup!
Open the register!

03:41.638 --> 03:43.724
I can't. It only opens
when you make a sale.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.518
All right, then give me
one of them horoscope scrolls.

03:46.602 --> 03:47.811
And some Skittles.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.982
Financial transaction
benefits you today. Ooh!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.150
Weird.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.034
All right, a bike!

04:02.117 --> 04:03.327
I'm out of here.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.750
Now, son, your parents
are on their way

04:09.833 --> 04:11.502
but since time
is a factor here

04:11.585 --> 04:13.128
we'd like to get
a positive I.D.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.213
as quickly as possible.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.924
Are you sure
he can't see me?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.509
Absolutely,
Chris.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.927
You're 100% safe.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.763
Okay. That's him.
Number Six.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.264
Hi, uh, excuse me, you guys.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.892
Yeah, I'm here to pick up
my son, Chris Griffin.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.310
Uh, he's here to finger the guy

04:28.393 --> 04:29.645
who held up
that convenience store.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.729
M-Maybe you've seen him.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.939
His name is Chris Griffin.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.148
No, wait a second.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.733
I think I got
a picture of him somewhere.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.193
Here-Here you go.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.861
Yeah, you can go ahead
and hang on to that.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.279
I got a ton of them
at home.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.323
In-In fact, I was going
to throw that one out anyway

04:41.406 --> 04:43.534
'cause Chris messed it up
by writing his school schedule

04:43.617 --> 04:45.369
and a list of his fears
all over the back of it.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.082
Oh, we're so proud
of you, Chris

04:50.165 --> 04:52.709
for helping to put that
horrible man in jail.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.420
Geez, you-you couldn't have said
it was Celine Dion, huh?

04:55.504 --> 04:57.756
O-Our one chance to put
that showboating, Canadian wench

04:57.840 --> 04:58.966
behind bars, and you blow it.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.594
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to:

05:03.637 --> 05:05.097
By-By the third season

05:05.180 --> 05:07.599
I was completely wasted
all the time.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.602
I-I'd lost all control
of my bodily functions.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.356
They had to cut the crap out
of my fur before each taping.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.525
But, uh,
would I do it all again?

05:16.608 --> 05:19.361
We interrupt this program
for a breaking news story.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.030
We now go live to the Rhode
Island State Penitentiary

05:22.114 --> 05:24.408
where Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa is standing by.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.034
Tricia?

05:26.118 --> 05:28.787
Tom, I'm outside
this maximum-security facility

05:28.871 --> 05:32.124
where a ruthless thug
has engineered a daring escape.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.709
Sir, do you
have any plans

05:33.792 --> 05:35.711
now that you're
out of jail?

05:35.794 --> 05:37.546
Yeah. I'm going to go
bang my girlfriend

05:37.629 --> 05:39.923
and then I'm going to kill
Chris Griffin!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.550
Good Lord!

05:41.633 --> 05:43.719
Can they really say
"bang my girlfriend"

05:43.802 --> 05:45.345
on TV?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.476
You want to remove
us from the area?

05:51.560 --> 05:52.853
Yes, ma'am. This criminal

05:52.936 --> 05:54.396
will stop at nothing
to find your son.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.814
So, we're placing your family

05:55.898 --> 05:57.149
in the witness
protection program.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.317
Oh, is Europe an option?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.735
I say, I've always wanted

05:59.818 --> 06:01.653
to spend a year in Prague
teaching English.

06:01.737 --> 06:02.821
You know, slacking off a bit

06:02.905 --> 06:04.573
but really getting
to know myself.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.991
Well, until we catch this guy

06:06.074 --> 06:07.951
you'll be relocated
to the Deep South.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.161
( all groaning )

06:09.244 --> 06:10.829
The Deep South?

06:10.913 --> 06:12.915
Isn't that the place where
the black guys are really lazy

06:12.998 --> 06:14.833
and all the white guys
are just as lazy

06:14.917 --> 06:17.085
but they're mad at the
black guys for being so lazy?

06:17.169 --> 06:19.087
Jenkins and I have
been assigned to live here

06:19.171 --> 06:20.964
and watch your house
while you're gone

06:21.048 --> 06:22.716
even though
he's a slovenly liberal

06:22.799 --> 06:24.134
and I'm a fastidious
conservative.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.011
( singsong :
I smell a sitcom.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.096
I suggest you start
packing immediately.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.353
I can't believe I have to
change schools because of you.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.938
This is all your fault, Lardo.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.481
Me? I had nothing
to do with it.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.649
No, I meant Chris.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.983
Oh.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.109
Yeah, Lardo.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.445
Look, everybody,
here we are.

06:43.529 --> 06:44.821
The town of Bumblescum.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.748
This is our house?

06:54.831 --> 06:55.832
Oh, come on, Meg.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.835
I bet if we fixed
it up a little bit

06:57.918 --> 06:58.919
it could be
a piece of crap.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.842
Ugh, what's that smell?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.845
It's either bad meat
or good cheese.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.347
There's a penny
underneath that couch.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.308
( screams )

07:13.392 --> 07:14.643
Somebody's in the closet!

07:14.726 --> 07:16.019
You know you're
a redneck

07:16.103 --> 07:18.397
when your gun rack
has a gun rack on it.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.940
You suck!

07:22.484 --> 07:23.819
Oh, my.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.904
Well, it's too hot
to cook anyway.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.323
Peter, what's the upstairs like?

07:28.407 --> 07:31.326
There's a crunchberry
underneath the fridge.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.370
Mom, Chris found a jar
in the basement

07:33.453 --> 07:34.997
and it has a hand in it.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.875
I'm going to plant it and see
if a human grows.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.836
Well, at least
the TV gets decent reception.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.881
Huh. Must be some kind
of nature show.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.507
( screaming ):
Help, help!

07:45.591 --> 07:47.134
Get it off! Get it off!

07:47.217 --> 07:48.218
MEG:
Great.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.678
We're here five minutes

07:49.761 --> 07:51.513
and Dad gets mauled
by a rodent.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.723
This place is horrible.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.224
Okay, now,
everybody calm down.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.019
We don't know anything
about this community.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.062
I bet if we
explore the town

07:59.146 --> 08:01.064
we'll each find something about
it we like.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.608
You know,
that's a great idea, Lois.

08:02.691 --> 08:03.859
I just got to hit the can.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.569
I think
there's just an outhouse, Peter.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.407
Hey, uh, Lois,
I don't get how this works.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.491
It's just a hole.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.327
I don't think it goes anywhere.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.704
No, it definitely doesn't
go anywhere.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.708
Ugh! Oh, God!

08:19.791 --> 08:22.252
Oh, it's everywhere!

08:22.336 --> 08:25.589
Aah, it's in my raccoon wounds!

08:25.672 --> 08:27.341
Oh, God!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
Excuse me, do you
have an ATM?

08:31.762 --> 08:32.846
Over there, ma'am.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.681
How much you want to take out?

08:34.765 --> 08:35.933
$40.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.768
There's a service charge
of a buck fifty.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.977
You'll accept?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.062
Yes.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.356
Mmm... you smell like the inside

08:42.439 --> 08:43.690
of my mama's purse.

08:43.774 --> 08:44.816
( laughs weakly )

08:44.900 --> 08:46.151
Thank you.

08:47.069 --> 08:50.155
What are those dulcet tones?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.699
Why, this is the music
of the angels.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.118
What is that magical device?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.203
Banjo.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.873
Pluck that string.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.166
( note plays )

09:01.250 --> 09:03.669
Oh, I feel so deliciously
white trash!

09:03.752 --> 09:05.254
Mommy, I want a mullet!

09:07.130 --> 09:08.841
All right,
that about does it.

09:08.924 --> 09:11.218
Isn't she
beautiful, Brian?

09:11.301 --> 09:12.636
The Duke boys would be proud,
Peter.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.137
Yeah, and you got to get in

09:14.221 --> 09:15.931
through the window like this.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.057
Okay, now you.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.768
Oh, sorry.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.645
I forgot to
roll yours down.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.855
You all right?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.275
Hello?

09:26.358 --> 09:28.402
Wake up,
sleepy head.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.407
Hi.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.658
Hi.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.660
Are you mad
at that pond?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.161
Shoot, no.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.455
'Course this pond did
kill my grandpappy.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.082
He saw his reflection
in the water

09:42.165 --> 09:44.793
thought it was him and drowned,
trying to save himself.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.087
That's why my mom doesn't let me
look in the toilet.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.213
I'm Sam.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.298
I'm Chris.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.717
Sam, come on in now.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.095
Well, I got to go help my daddy
bring in the mud harvest.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.681
Nice making your
acquaintance, Chris.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.267
Oh, my God, I'm drowning!

10:02.603 --> 10:04.479
RADIO DEEJAY:
And that was Merle Haggard

10:04.563 --> 10:06.356
with "I Kissed My Sweetie
With My Fist."

10:06.732 --> 10:07.774
Coming up next...

10:07.858 --> 10:08.859
All right,
there's one.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.943
Let's jump that.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.241
Yeeee-haaw!

10:18.452 --> 10:19.786
Oh, that was great.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.663
Hey, next time, let's get Meg
to be Boss Hogg

10:21.747 --> 10:22.915
and Chris can be Anus.

10:22.998 --> 10:23.999
Enos.
What did I say?

10:24.082 --> 10:25.083
Anus.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.168
( laughs )

10:29.338 --> 10:32.049
All right, class, we have
a new student joining us.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.594
Everyone, please welcome
Megan Griffin from the North.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.346
Ooh... Aah...
Ooh... Aah...

10:37.429 --> 10:38.722
What's it like up there?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.349
Y'all got them
talking pictures?

10:40.432 --> 10:41.558
And flying machines?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.310
And perfume for your armpits?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.770
We sure do.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.063
Ooh... Aah...
Ooh... Aah...

10:46.146 --> 10:47.272
All right, class.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.233
That's enough questions
for Megan.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.401
Time to hand back
last week's spelling tests.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.695
And it looks like Oinky
set the curve again.

10:53.779 --> 10:54.821
Oh, dang it.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.031
That is some smart pig.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.366
Good thing I copied
off of Oinky.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.953
Ta-dah!

11:01.036 --> 11:02.579
Possum surprise!

11:02.663 --> 11:04.873
Actually, I made it
with Shake-'n'-Bake.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.500
And I helped.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.918
Kids, where's
your father?

11:08.001 --> 11:11.213
PETER AND BRIAN:
Yeee-haaw!

11:11.296 --> 11:13.841
Oh, Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

11:13.924 --> 11:14.925
I'm blending in.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.426
Relax, Lois.
It's not our house.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.970
Well, I'm glad
you're having fun

11:18.095 --> 11:19.346
but we need some
money coming in.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.181
Have you thought about
looking for a job?

11:21.265 --> 11:22.683
Yes, Lois, I have.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.477
But I've also thought about
getting fired from that job.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.063
Is that something you want
to put our family through?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.315
Think about that
while I get myself a drink.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.525
Ah, ah! Oh, God!

11:31.608 --> 11:32.818
( screaming )

11:33.485 --> 11:36.154
It's right up here
past this clearing.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.240
He's been here
about three months now.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.449
Wow!

11:39.533 --> 11:41.493
Where do you think
you go when you die?

11:41.577 --> 11:44.788
I learnt at church that if
you're good, you go to heaven.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.957
But if you're bad,
you go to a place

11:47.040 --> 11:49.168
where the dead believe
they're still living

11:49.251 --> 11:52.171
and they pray for death,
but death won't come.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.297
UPN?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.381
( laughing )

11:54.464 --> 11:55.632
You're funny.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.092
I like you, Chris.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.635
I like you, too, Sam.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.262
Want to poke him?

12:00.345 --> 12:01.555
Do I?!

12:02.973 --> 12:04.850
You know, it's true.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.436
The best things in life
really are free.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.856
I don't know, Brian.
Maybe Lois is right.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.983
Maybe it is time
for me to get a job.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.068
Yeah, too bad you always blow it
in the interview.

12:15.152 --> 12:18.155
So, Peter, where do you see yourself
in five years?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.616
Don't say doing your wife.
Don't say doing your wife.

12:20.699 --> 12:21.742
Doing your...

12:22.993 --> 12:23.994
...son?

12:25.412 --> 12:26.496
Hey, Brian,
look at that.

12:27.748 --> 12:28.957
Y'all interested?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.334
We just take turns
being the Sheriff.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.418
It's real easy.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.586
You just hang out here

12:32.669 --> 12:33.837
eat some pie and get drunk.

12:33.921 --> 12:34.963
Wait, hold on a second.

12:35.047 --> 12:38.717
"Pie"? "Drunk"? "The"?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.135
You got yourself a sheriff.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.931
Boy, it's so quiet
around here.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.015
I know.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.018
The-the phone hasn't
rang all day.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.269
I-I know.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.648
There's nothing,
nothing to, um...

12:52.731 --> 12:56.151
to, uh...

12:56.360 --> 12:58.529
um...

12:58.612 --> 13:01.740
uh, oh, boy, what's the word
I'm looking for?

13:01.823 --> 13:02.824
...do.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.576
Uh, Brian, you-you're drunk.

13:04.660 --> 13:05.661
You're drunk.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.162
Give me your keys.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.332
What is this, Dad?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.000
A Southern
tradition, son.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.044
It's a reenactment
of the Civil War.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.047
Robert E. Lee.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.674
I knew I'd find you here

13:18.757 --> 13:21.009
where they seat
the sorry-ass losers.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.553
( laughs drunkenly )

13:22.636 --> 13:25.806
Ulysses S. Grant,
you invite me to lunch

13:25.889 --> 13:28.392
then show up an hour late,
drunk?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.728
I was busy looking for your wife
to give her the old...

13:31.812 --> 13:33.313
( babbles incoherently )

13:33.397 --> 13:35.774
Sir, this means war.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.609
I am vanquished.

13:37.693 --> 13:42.531
I hereby declare victory in the name
of the Confederacy.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.741
( cheering )

13:44.825 --> 13:46.243
Uh, excuse me.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.412
Uh, I don't think
that's how it happened.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.913
I'm pretty sure the North won.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.540
What are you saying, fella?

13:51.623 --> 13:54.293
I'm saying that drunken idiot
kicked your sorry asses

13:54.418 --> 13:55.919
south of the
Donna Dixon line.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.672
We don't take too kindly
to that sort of talk, Mister.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.048
And I sure
as shoot don't want

14:00.132 --> 14:01.675
your kid hanging around
with my kid.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.094
And if you think
I'm mad now

14:04.178 --> 14:06.305
you got to answer
to them Civil War survivors.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.557
( grumbling and growling)

14:08.640 --> 14:09.641
Uh, uh, uh, wait!

14:09.725 --> 14:10.726
Look over there!

14:10.851 --> 14:12.394
It's a newly married
interracial gay couple

14:12.477 --> 14:13.770
burning the American flag.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.400
Get him!

14:21.403 --> 14:23.405
I guess we can't
hang out anymore.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.907
Guess not.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.784
That sucks, 'cause I really
like spending time with you.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.077
Me, too.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.039
( groaning )

14:32.122 --> 14:33.665
What are you doing?

14:38.754 --> 14:41.757
WAYLON JENNINGS: Now, them Griffin boys
better grow some wings

14:41.840 --> 14:43.300
or start flapping their arm.

14:49.890 --> 14:50.933
Lost them!

14:51.016 --> 14:52.309
Dad-blasted
Lincoln lovers.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.435
Anyone seen my foot?

14:55.437 --> 14:56.980
Man, was last night weird.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.482
I kissed a boy.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.443
But the truth is,
I really like him as a friend.

15:01.527 --> 15:02.611
His name is Sam.

15:02.694 --> 15:03.946
You kissed Sam
last night?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.113
How did you know?

15:05.197 --> 15:06.406
Well, you're saying it out loud.

15:06.490 --> 15:07.616
I could hear you
in the other room.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.034
The weird thing is

15:09.117 --> 15:10.953
kissing Sam
kind of felt right.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.413
But I don't know if
I can face him again.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.957
Brian, what should I do?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.918
I haven't been this confused
since the end of No Way Out.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.798
How does Kevin Costner
keep getting work?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.554
Oh, how do I shoot?
How do I shoot?

15:28.637 --> 15:29.972
Push "B"! "B" button!

15:30.055 --> 15:31.181
( knocking )

15:31.265 --> 15:32.683
Telegram for Chris Griffin.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.101
Oh, he's not here.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.310
Well, where is he?

15:35.394 --> 15:36.979
I can't release
that information.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.189
Oh, uh, did I say Chris?

15:39.273 --> 15:40.649
I meant Chris's sister.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.193
Oh. Oh, well, if it's for Meg,
that's a whole other story.

15:43.277 --> 15:44.903
Here's her address.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.280
What are you doing?

15:46.363 --> 15:47.781
You were busy,
so I played your guy.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.575
Fine, I didn't want
to play, anyway.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.159
Well, then, it worked
out for everybody.

15:51.243 --> 15:52.786
I'm going to draw boobs
on the Etch-A-Sketch.

15:52.870 --> 15:53.912
Go ahead, they always
come out square.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.040
Oh, hi, Chris.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.208
Hey.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.543
Um, listen, Sam

15:59.626 --> 16:01.879
I like hanging out
with you and all.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.007
It's just that I don't want
a romantic relationship.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.217
But I'd like it if
we could still be friends.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.510
I'd like that, too.

16:08.594 --> 16:09.595
Want to go for a swim?

16:09.678 --> 16:10.846
Sure.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.017
( gasps )

16:15.100 --> 16:16.268
You're a girl!

16:16.351 --> 16:17.519
Of course I am.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.021
Oh, my God!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.278
Warm out today.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.405
Warm yesterday.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.657
Even warmer today.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.612
Yes, please.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.489
You know, the kids
are going to be

17:10.572 --> 17:12.241
at that town social
for a while.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.493
I think I know
where you're going.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.370
( laughter )

17:16.453 --> 17:17.955
( yelling )

17:18.038 --> 17:19.456
Oh, God!

17:19.540 --> 17:20.582
( phone rings )

17:20.707 --> 17:21.792
Hello?

17:21.875 --> 17:22.876
Hello, Mrs. Griffin?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.336
Yeah. Shh! Shut up!

17:24.419 --> 17:25.629
You guys, shut up!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.923
Yeah, hi, this is the FBI,
calling from your house.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.258
Oh, God, oh, God!

17:29.341 --> 17:30.634
Hi, how is everything?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.636
Good, good,
real good, real good.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.264
Listen, uh,
promise you won't be mad

17:35.347 --> 17:37.391
and it's probably nothing...

17:37.474 --> 17:39.059
Giggedy-giggedy-giggedy.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.811
...but, um, you know that
criminal who's after your son?

17:41.019 --> 17:42.813
Yeah, he might know
where you guys are.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.022
What?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.190
Peter, that criminal

17:45.274 --> 17:47.025
is on his way here
to kill Chris!

17:47.109 --> 17:48.402
We got to call the Sheriff.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.945
Holy crap, I'm on it, Lois.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.071
( phone rings )

17:51.196 --> 17:52.322
Sheriff's office.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.074
Yes, hello, this is
Peter Griffin.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.951
I'd like to report
a dangerous criminal

17:56.034 --> 17:57.202
who may be
coming into town.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.037
I'm sorry, could you
repeat your name?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.330
Yes, it's Peter Griffin.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.249
G-r-i-f-f-i-n.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.001
Wait a minute,
you're the Sheriff?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.711
Hang on one sec, honey,
I'm on the phone.

18:05.794 --> 18:06.795
Who's that?
My wife.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.338
Peter, Chris is in danger.

18:08.422 --> 18:09.464
Do something.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.300
Round up a posse.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.802
Yeah, well, see, I kind of
pissed off the whole town

18:13.886 --> 18:15.804
at that Civil War
reenactment.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.472
Oh, what are
we going to do?

18:17.556 --> 18:18.807
I don't know, Lois

18:18.891 --> 18:21.435
but I feel lower than
a bowlegged caterpillar.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.644
( chuckling )

18:22.728 --> 18:23.979
Now here's Roy.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.107
( music plays )

18:28.233 --> 18:30.944
Sure is a ding-dang
of a hoedown.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.571
Nuh-uh, this here is
a hootenanny.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.697
-Hoedown!
-Hootenanny!

18:33.822 --> 18:34.865
-Hoedown!
-Hootenanny!

18:34.948 --> 18:36.074
-Hoedown!
-Hootenanny!

18:36.158 --> 18:38.076
( grunting )

18:39.786 --> 18:42.247
Thank you,
thank you very much, thank you.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.917
Oh, and to the owner
of a John Deere tractor

18:45.000 --> 18:47.085
you're parked on top of a pig.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.588
John Deere tractor
on top of a pig.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.340
Sam, can I talk to you?

18:51.423 --> 18:53.967
Sure, but why aren't you
looking at me?

18:54.051 --> 18:55.928
Well, that's the thing, um.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.930
I'm no good at
talking to girls.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.556
That's why
I ran away from you.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.892
Well, you didn't
have trouble talking to me

19:01.975 --> 19:03.644
when you thought
I was a boy.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.020
Yeah, that's true.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.231
Just pretend I'm a boy.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.357
Okay.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.483
You want to go down

19:09.566 --> 19:11.109
to the Old Town Bridge
and make out?

19:11.193 --> 19:12.861
Yes, sir!

19:12.945 --> 19:14.029
And in the city

19:14.112 --> 19:16.490
glasses are considered
really sexy.

19:16.615 --> 19:17.950
( oohs and aahs )

19:18.033 --> 19:19.368
Dang, I hope her brother

19:19.618 --> 19:21.119
don't already
have dibs on her.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.539
Meg, where's Chris?

19:23.622 --> 19:24.623
That criminal's here,
and he's after him.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.124
He's down by
the Old Town Bridge.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.879
You know, my brother is
the one he's here to kill.

19:30.963 --> 19:32.089
( Southern accent :
My daughter

19:32.172 --> 19:33.966
would absolutely love you.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.136
You're so cute.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.639
You're like
a skinny Garth Brooks.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.225
Aha! I got you now, Griffin.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.309
( squeals )

19:44.393 --> 19:45.602
Not so fast, buddy.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.020
Who are you?

19:47.104 --> 19:49.857
Oh, you can call me
Officer T.J. Hooker.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.317
Sheriff Officer T.J. Hooker.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.903
And this is my deputy,
McMillan and Wife.

19:54.987 --> 19:56.488
Well, I hated T.J. Hooker

19:56.572 --> 19:58.824
and I never actually saw
McMillan and Wife

19:58.907 --> 20:00.576
although I was aware of it.

20:00.742 --> 20:01.869
Anyway, you're dead!

20:03.203 --> 20:06.081
Ha, you're mine now, fella!

20:08.083 --> 20:09.293
( yelling )

20:09.376 --> 20:10.836
Ahh! Dad!

20:10.919 --> 20:12.838
Help! Help! Dad!

20:12.921 --> 20:15.340
( gunshots )

20:15.424 --> 20:16.550
You folks all right?

20:16.633 --> 20:19.011
Wow, you guys
saved our lives.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.722
And after I said that all
Southern people have bad teeth

20:21.889 --> 20:25.225
and suffer from the gum disease
known as gingivitis.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.852
Well, we take care
of our own

20:26.935 --> 20:28.520
and as long as
y'all live here

20:28.645 --> 20:30.022
y'all are
Southerners, too.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.857
Wow, thanks.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.192
It's our pleasure.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.068
Sam, I'll see you at home.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.112
You know, I think
the lesson here is

20:37.196 --> 20:39.072
it really doesn't matter
where you're from

20:39.156 --> 20:41.116
as long as we're all
the same religion.

20:42.034 --> 20:45.245
It was great having you
in class, Meg.

20:45.329 --> 20:46.705
Thanks.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.248
I'm really going
to miss everybody.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.000
We didn't have no money
for a present

20:50.083 --> 20:51.877
so we all
just spit in a jar.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.004
I can't believe
you're leaving.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.380
Me either.

20:55.464 --> 20:56.548
I'll be sure to write.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.675
And I'll be sure
to learn to read.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.886
The next time I see
a dead guy

21:00.969 --> 21:02.221
I'm going to poke him

21:02.304 --> 21:04.223
twice as hard
for both of us.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.815
Oh, it's so nice
to be home.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.693
You have 113 new messages.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.904
Oh, my.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.782
HERBERT: Uh, yeah,
I was just wondering, uh...

21:21.990 --> 21:25.285
hmm... where
the newspaper boy was.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.745
( beep )

21:26.828 --> 21:28.789
Haven't seen a newspaper
in a couple days.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.749
Wondering if you're ever
going to come back.

21:30.832 --> 21:31.834
( beep )

21:31.917 --> 21:33.210
Guess who?

21:33.293 --> 21:36.672
Sorry to leave you
so many messages.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.549
Just lonely here.

21:38.632 --> 21:41.635
Thinking about
the muscley-arm paperboy.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.304
Wishing he'd come by
and bring me some good news.

21:44.388 --> 21:45.764
( beep )

21:45.848 --> 21:46.974
Where are you?

21:47.099 --> 21:48.684
( beep )

21:48.767 --> 21:52.145
You're starting to piss me off,
you little piggly sumbitch.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.230
Call me.
