<i>♫ Oh little town of Bethlehem ♫</i>

01:05.307 --> 01:08.937
<i>♫ How still we see thee lie ♫</i>

01:09.895 --> 01:14.107
<i>♫ Above thy deep and dreamless sleep ♫</i>

01:14.108 --> 01:18.236
<i>♫ The silent stars go by ♫</i>

01:18.237 --> 01:20.706
- Just the right half, please.

01:21.866 --> 01:25.994
<i>♫ Yet in thy dark street shineth ♫</i>

01:25.995 --> 01:29.789
<i>♫ The everlasting light ♫</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:31.167
- The other half.

01:32.501 --> 01:36.713
<i>♫ The hopes and fears of all the years ♫</i>

01:36.714 --> 01:40.139
<i>♫ Are met in thee tonight ♫</i>

01:50.728 --> 01:52.937
- You three, sing.

01:52.938 --> 01:56.943
<i>♫ Yet in thy dark street shineth ♫</i>

01:58.069 --> 02:01.369
<i>♫ The everlasting light ♫</i>

02:02.406 --> 02:07.202
<i>♫ The hopes and fears of all the years ♫</i>

02:07.203 --> 02:10.673
<i>♫ Are met in thee tonight ♫</i>

02:14.759 --> 02:15.594
- Thank you.

02:15.595 --> 02:16.836
That will be all.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.296
Honey, why don't you…

02:18.297 --> 02:19.173
- Shut up.

02:20.016 --> 02:23.728
- I don't recall asking
for a second opinion.

02:25.054 --> 02:26.522
Sing a bit softer.

02:29.725 --> 02:31.853
- She sounds worse
than when I kick my dog.

02:47.243 --> 02:49.792
<i>♫ Silent night ♫</i>

02:50.871 --> 02:53.249
<i>♫ Holy night ♫</i>

02:54.959 --> 02:57.428
<i>♫ All is calm ♫</i>

02:59.046 --> 03:01.640
<i>♫ All is bright ♫</i>

03:03.008 --> 03:06.886
- And the Moon shone with
a special brightness.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.055
And, as if by magic,

03:09.056 --> 03:12.225
animals who were natural enemies,

03:12.226 --> 03:15.687
when they saw it lay down together.

03:15.688 --> 03:17.564
The leopard with the chicken.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.191
The lion with the lamb.

03:20.192 --> 03:23.662
<i>♫ Sleep in heavenly peace ♫</i>

03:26.073 --> 03:29.325
- And though snow fell
they were no longer cold.

03:29.326 --> 03:30.451
<i>♫ Sleep in heavenly peace ♫</i>
- Which is why

03:30.452 --> 03:31.578
many believe today

03:31.579 --> 03:34.581
that when the moon is
full on Christmas Eve,

03:34.582 --> 03:37.381
it offers a magical time of peace,

03:38.252 --> 03:40.587
a blessing on the world.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.932
<i>♫ Holy night ♫</i>

03:44.175 --> 03:45.592
<i>♫ Shepherds quake ♫</i>

03:45.593 --> 03:49.314
- And guided by
a star, the wise men.

04:01.525 --> 04:03.735
<i>♫ Heavenly hosts ♫</i>

04:03.736 --> 04:07.906
- Guided by a star, the
wise men came bearing gifts,

04:07.907 --> 04:10.867
gold and spices from the orient,

04:10.868 --> 04:14.998
oils and silk.
♫ Christ the savior is born

04:17.708 --> 04:21.338
<i>♫ Christ the savior is born ♫</i>

05:22.314 --> 05:24.357
- Up a little bit.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.775
A little more.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.031
All the way up.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.158
Come on, guys.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.583
- Oh, look, Santa's reindeer.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.669
Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer…

05:44.670 --> 05:46.638
- There's a car.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.174
- Now Dasher, now Dancer, now…

05:50.175 --> 05:52.760
- Get out of the street.

05:52.761 --> 05:54.137
- Now Dasher!

05:54.138 --> 05:55.430
Now Dancer!

05:55.431 --> 05:57.015
Now…

05:57.016 --> 05:58.141
- Watch it!

06:02.521 --> 06:03.317
- Prancer!

06:10.571 --> 06:11.743
- I've been telling
the council for years

06:11.744 --> 06:13.284
these decorations are too old.

06:13.285 --> 06:16.911
- Almost went right
through that man's windshield.

06:16.912 --> 06:18.161
- Oh, look.

06:18.162 --> 06:19.129
- Looks like Santa's

06:19.130 --> 06:22.000
only going to have seven
reindeer this year.

06:25.294 --> 06:26.796
- Up and out, people.

06:26.797 --> 06:28.212
Let's clear the streets.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.089
Don't want any accidents.

06:29.090 --> 06:30.966
Let's clear the street.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.271
- Aren't you going to fix him?

06:37.639 --> 06:40.183
Aren't you going to fix him?

06:40.184 --> 06:41.401
- I don't know.

06:42.519 --> 06:43.644
- They've got to fix him.

06:43.645 --> 06:45.730
Santa needs all his reindeer.

06:45.731 --> 06:48.775
Maybe he can't fly without Prancer.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.486
- It's not the real Prancer.

06:51.487 --> 06:53.154
It's just wood.

06:53.155 --> 06:54.281
- I know that.

06:56.075 --> 06:57.292
It's just wood.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.380
- I don't know, you
got a lot of hours on it.

07:05.381 --> 07:08.380
- Hey, that tractor's
only three years old.

07:08.381 --> 07:10.505
- Yeah, but I can
only give you 1,900 for it.

07:10.506 --> 07:11.676
- It's worth twice that.

07:11.677 --> 07:13.596
- Look, I know you're
having a rough time here.

07:13.597 --> 07:15.843
- Dad, guess what?

07:15.844 --> 07:16.640
- 3,000.

07:17.554 --> 07:18.599
- A reindeer fell

07:18.600 --> 07:21.015
and almost went right
through a man's windshield.

07:21.016 --> 07:21.812
- Not now!

07:23.102 --> 07:24.604
- That's my best offer.

07:24.605 --> 07:26.230
Take it or leave it.

07:32.694 --> 07:33.570
- Leave it.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.406
What are you dressed up for?

07:36.407 --> 07:40.287
- It was the Christmas
pageant today, remember?

07:41.286 --> 07:42.328
- Yeah.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.579
How'd it go?

07:43.580 --> 07:45.164
- Good.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.582
- That's good.

07:46.583 --> 07:47.583
- You know what?

07:47.584 --> 07:50.884
Shawn Griswold was supposed
to carry the baby Jesus,

07:50.885 --> 07:52.463
but he lost it.

07:52.464 --> 07:54.799
They had to wrap up a bunch of rags

07:54.800 --> 07:56.518
and use that instead.

08:05.894 --> 08:07.271
Dad, are we poor?

08:09.523 --> 08:10.775
- No, we're not poor.

08:10.776 --> 08:13.072
We're just down on our luck.

08:14.111 --> 08:16.864
- Well, will we be up on our luck?

08:18.407 --> 08:21.576
- I'm doing everything I can.

08:21.577 --> 08:24.287
- I could help if you let me.

08:24.288 --> 08:26.586
- You're just a little girl.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.292
- Are we going to starve?

08:29.293 --> 08:30.920
- No, of course not.

08:32.754 --> 08:34.927
Stop worrying about
these things, will you?

08:34.928 --> 08:37.799
We're going to be all right.

08:37.801 --> 08:38.927
Apples.

08:40.511 --> 08:42.058
We're going to eat apple sauce

08:42.059 --> 08:45.349
and apple cider and apple pie.

08:45.350 --> 08:50.313
And then stewed apples and
baked apples and dried apples.

08:50.314 --> 08:51.361
Apple butter.

08:52.941 --> 08:53.783
Heck, no.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.151
We're not gonna starve.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.118
- Hi, Aunt Sarah.

09:06.538 --> 09:08.789
Steve, can you fix my sled?

09:08.790 --> 09:10.458
- No.

09:10.459 --> 09:11.299
' No?

09:11.300 --> 09:12.089
- No.

Wish.

Flop, flop, wish.

09:59.091 --> 10:01.389
There's going to be a
full moon this Christmas.

10:01.390 --> 10:04.184
- Don't talk with your mouth full.

10:06.723 --> 10:07.519
- Sorry.

10:10.894 --> 10:13.818
That means there's bound to
be magic things happening.

10:13.819 --> 10:15.189
- Give me a break.

10:15.190 --> 10:17.275
- You don't know anything about it.

10:17.276 --> 10:18.198
Our teacher…

10:18.199 --> 10:20.236
- There is something about a full moon.

10:20.237 --> 10:21.737
Nancy Hooper works over at the hospital

10:21.738 --> 10:23.411
and she says whenever there's a full moon,

10:23.412 --> 10:24.954
the patients on the eighth floor,

10:24.955 --> 10:27.159
you know, the mental patients,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.996
they all start acting up like crazy.

10:29.997 --> 10:30.837
- Really?

10:30.838 --> 10:31.671
- Mm hmm.

10:31.672 --> 10:32.507
' How?

10:32.508 --> 10:35.503
- Why don't you go there on
Christmas Eve and find out?

10:35.504 --> 10:37.169
They'll show you magic.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.047
- Why are you so nasty?

10:40.882 --> 10:41.849
- You want to eat like an animal,

10:41.850 --> 10:44.391
take your food out to the barn.

11:45.113 --> 11:47.615
- It's not an easy
thing that we're playing here.

11:47.616 --> 11:49.492
- It's not easy on me either.

11:49.493 --> 11:51.746
You think I like not being
able to provide for her?

11:51.747 --> 11:52.792
- You do provide.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.330
- No, I don't.

11:54.331 --> 11:57.380
I can't even get a bank loan anymore.

12:00.796 --> 12:04.173
- Have you told her yet, John?

12:04.174 --> 12:05.508
You've got to.

12:05.509 --> 12:06.351
- I know.

12:07.636 --> 12:08.432
I know.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.568
- I still don't see why
she's been coming over

12:15.569 --> 12:17.019
so much lately.

12:17.020 --> 12:18.190
- She's your aunt.

12:18.191 --> 12:19.814
She's trying to help out.

12:19.815 --> 12:22.942
- She asked dad if he told me yet.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.026
Told me what?

12:24.027 --> 12:25.700
- Maybe they're gonna get married.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.154
- Don't be revolting.

12:27.155 --> 12:29.281
She's married to my uncle Arnold.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.329
- Maybe they were talking

12:30.330 --> 12:33.579
about a surprise, a Christmas
present they got you.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.706
- You know Santa's the one
who brings all the presents.

12:36.707 --> 12:37.998
- Oh, right.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.625
Santa Claus.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.751
- You know it's true.

12:40.752 --> 12:43.963
My mother told me, and she'd never lie.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.550
- Let's not talk about it
anymore right now, though.

12:47.551 --> 12:50.930
There's some serious sledding to be done.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.514
- We're the first ones.

12:53.515 --> 12:56.815
- The only ones crazy enough to do this.

13:23.378 --> 13:25.087
- Hey, you!

13:25.088 --> 13:27.006
This is private property.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.634
Get off my property.

13:30.218 --> 13:31.927
- Steer away!

13:31.928 --> 13:33.012
Turn!

13:33.013 --> 13:34.477
- I'm trying, I'm trying-

13:34.478 --> 13:36.771
- Don't you come here, you hooligans!

13:38.977 --> 13:40.853
Go away, you violators.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.900
You hit me and you'll go to juvenile hall.

13:45.776 --> 13:46.698
Oh.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.111
Oh, my floribundas.

13:49.112 --> 13:50.362
Oh.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.363
You animals!

13:51.364 --> 13:53.583
Oh, oh, oh, my floribundas.

13:54.659 --> 13:55.993
You rascals!

13:55.994 --> 13:58.078
Oh, I'll get even with you.

13:58.079 --> 13:58.955
I'll catch you.

13:58.956 --> 14:00.539
I'll catch you, you.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.931
I'll get YOU, YOU, YOU…

14:13.345 --> 14:15.097
Terrorists!

14:16.681 --> 14:18.149
- Would she recognize us?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.643
- I don't think so.

14:26.316 --> 14:27.483
See you tomorrow.

14:27.484 --> 14:28.451
_ Okay, bye-

16:28.480 --> 16:31.029
- I've never seen one like you.

16:41.206 --> 16:43.124
You're not afraid of me.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.787
Dad, I just saw a deer in the woods.

17:26.788 --> 17:27.630
- Come in here.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.248
- It was interesting.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.749
It was so big.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.668
It looked like a giant.

17:32.669 --> 17:36.046
It was so weird, you would never imagine.

17:36.047 --> 17:37.390
- How many times have I told you

17:37.391 --> 17:38.882
not to go near McFarland's?

17:38.883 --> 17:39.848
- Dad, will you listen…

17:39.849 --> 17:40.810
- She just gave me a call

17:40.811 --> 17:42.723
and says you ruined some
of her flower bushes.

17:42.724 --> 17:44.598
You wanna guess who's gonna pay for those?

17:44.599 --> 17:45.639
- But, dad!

17:45.640 --> 17:48.189
- I want you to
stay away from there.

17:48.190 --> 17:52.312
- It looked just like the one in my room.

17:52.313 --> 17:53.109
Hey!

17:54.065 --> 17:55.691
- You hear me?

17:55.692 --> 17:57.945
- Yeah, I do, clad.

18:29.517 --> 18:31.894
- I believe you saw a deer in the woods.

18:31.895 --> 18:33.854
There's lots of 'em around.

18:33.855 --> 18:35.823
But I don't believe it was Santa's,

18:35.824 --> 18:37.816
and I don't believe it flies.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.990
- It looks just like this one, Prancer.

18:39.991 --> 18:42.865
See the white mark on his forehead?

18:43.907 --> 18:44.783
Hey, wait a minute.

18:44.784 --> 18:47.411
Remember it was Prancer that
fell down on Main Street?

18:47.412 --> 18:49.203
- That's right, it was.

18:49.204 --> 18:50.871
- So is this one.

18:50.872 --> 18:54.541
I have a magazine that had
all the reindeers lined up.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.418
I cut them out and this is the order.

18:56.419 --> 18:58.629
This is Prancer and this is,

18:58.630 --> 19:00.598
this is Prancer, Dancer,

19:01.549 --> 19:03.300
okay, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer,

19:03.301 --> 19:05.677
this is Vixen and this is Prancer.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.430
- Are you going to eat your pickle?

19:08.431 --> 19:11.058
- The moon's almost full!

19:11.059 --> 19:13.435
It'll be full on Christmas Eve.

19:13.436 --> 19:14.278
Don't you see?

19:14.279 --> 19:15.613
It all fits together.

19:15.614 --> 19:18.273
- The problem is, Jessie,

19:18.274 --> 19:21.026
I don't believe in Santa Claus anymore.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.569
- What?

19:22.570 --> 19:24.034
- I mean, think about it.

19:24.035 --> 19:26.078
How could one man climb
down all the chimneys

19:26.079 --> 19:28.242
in the world in one night?

19:28.243 --> 19:30.041
- He's magical, Carol.

19:31.287 --> 19:33.247
- It doesn't make sense.

19:33.248 --> 19:36.969
- Well, Carol, not everything
in the world can be explained.

19:36.970 --> 19:39.211
- I've never seen Santa Claus,

19:39.212 --> 19:41.755
and I've clone a lot of looking.

19:41.756 --> 19:43.382
- You've never seen God, either.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.134
Does that mean there's no God?

19:45.135 --> 19:48.720
- Well, how do we know
about that for sure?

19:48.721 --> 19:52.933
- Because if there's no
God, there's no heaven.

19:52.934 --> 19:55.602
- Well, maybe there isn't.

19:55.603 --> 19:57.947
- All right for you, Carol Wetherby.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.317
You're not my friend anymore.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.236
- What did I say?

20:04.237 --> 20:06.947
- That there was no heaven!

20:06.948 --> 20:07.744
' $0?

20:08.867 --> 20:11.165
- What about my mother then?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.169
- I said I'm sorry.

20:20.170 --> 20:22.337
Jessie, come on!

20:22.338 --> 20:23.383
I was just kidding.

20:23.384 --> 20:25.132
I believe in Santa Claus, okay?

20:25.133 --> 20:27.097
I believe in God, and I believe in heaven.

20:27.098 --> 20:29.136
- Do you believe it was Prancer?

20:29.137 --> 20:29.979
- Yes.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.769
- I don't believe you.

20:36.477 --> 20:37.524
- There's my mom.

20:37.525 --> 20:40.399
She's taking me Christmas shopping.

20:41.691 --> 20:43.159
Talk to you later.

22:23.751 --> 22:24.877
- Get in here!

22:27.171 --> 22:27.967
Come on!

22:36.014 --> 22:40.017
I talk and I talk and you
just don't listen, do you?

22:40.018 --> 22:43.061
What are you doing out there by yourself?

22:43.062 --> 22:44.479
- Looking for the reindeer.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.106
- I've told you never to go into the woods

22:46.107 --> 22:48.108
by yourself this time of year.

22:48.109 --> 22:50.077
A hunter will shoot you!

22:57.493 --> 22:59.536
- Where were you going, daddy?

22:59.537 --> 23:01.747
- Just groceries.

23:01.748 --> 23:05.218
You know, looking at some feed and things.

23:07.045 --> 23:11.048
- I heard you and Aunt Sarah
talking the other night.

23:11.049 --> 23:13.268
What does told me yet mean?

23:14.844 --> 23:15.640
- What?

23:15.641 --> 23:18.014
- What does told me yet mean?

23:20.350 --> 23:21.226
- Oh, baby.

23:23.019 --> 23:24.271
You know, it's just not right

23:24.272 --> 23:28.400
when a little girl's got to
grow up without a mom around.

23:33.363 --> 23:36.829
We've been talking about maybe
you going to live with her.

23:36.830 --> 23:39.543
- No, daddy, please,
I don't wanna do that.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.082
- I know you don't.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.580
This is a hard thing for me to do,

23:43.581 --> 23:46.002
but I got to think about
what's best for you.

23:46.003 --> 23:47.798
- You're what's best for me.

23:47.799 --> 23:49.294
- No, I'm not.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.639
I can't buy you the things you want.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.633
Can't give you an education.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.729
Sarah will be able to do those things.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.390
- Please, daddy.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.266
Please.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.235
I want to stay with you.

24:07.397 --> 24:09.695
Daddy, I know we argue, but,

24:12.860 --> 24:14.820
please, daddy, please.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.916
- Honey, us arguing hasn't
got anything to do with it.

24:17.917 --> 24:22.244
It's just not right that I'm
away from the house so much.

24:22.245 --> 24:25.044
- Send Steve if someone has to go.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.916
- He's older than you.

24:27.917 --> 24:29.501
I need his help.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.628
- I help, too.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.302
- I know you do.
- I can do everything he does.

24:33.303 --> 24:34.467
He'll get too old for work.

24:34.468 --> 24:35.637
I can take his place.

24:35.638 --> 24:38.135
Please, daddy, please.

24:38.136 --> 24:39.928
- You'll only be 30 miles away.

24:39.929 --> 24:40.771
- 30 miles!

24:40.772 --> 24:42.853
That's like a billion, two trillion,

24:42.854 --> 24:43.941
a thousand miles…

24:43.942 --> 24:45.642
- Calm down, will ya?

24:45.643 --> 24:47.519
Families do this for
each other all the time.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.648
They help each other out
when things get tough

24:49.649 --> 24:52.607
and things are tough for me right now.

24:52.608 --> 24:55.152
- I'm gonna run away if she comes for me.

24:55.153 --> 24:56.496
- I don't wanna
hear you talk like that.

24:56.497 --> 24:59.453
- I will if she comes
and you'll never find me.

24:59.454 --> 25:00.574
- Stop it, Jessica!

25:00.575 --> 25:01.783
- Dad, look out!

25:12.670 --> 25:13.920
It's him!

25:13.921 --> 25:15.969
- Wait, stay here!

25:19.844 --> 25:21.344
- He's hurt, daddy.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.063
- Stay away from him.

25:31.814 --> 25:33.441
- We gotta help him.

25:49.207 --> 25:50.582
Daddy, no!

25:50.583 --> 25:51.550
- It's hurt.

25:53.461 --> 25:55.462
It's been wounded, Jessie.

25:55.463 --> 25:56.305
- No!

25:56.306 --> 25:57.594
- Let go!

25:58.925 --> 25:59.765
- You can't!

25:59.766 --> 26:00.679
It's the one I saw!

26:00.680 --> 26:01.518
It's Santa's!

26:01.519 --> 26:05.013
- Jessie, he's just gonna suffer.

26:06.307 --> 26:07.307
- No, no!

26:07.308 --> 26:08.685
I hate you, I hate you!

26:08.686 --> 26:11.478
- All right, you hate me, you hate me!

26:34.794 --> 26:37.593
- I'm going to look over this way.

26:38.923 --> 26:40.882
- Don't even think about it.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.607
This is gonna stop.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.076
- You're here.

29:13.911 --> 29:16.380
How did you know where I live?

29:22.962 --> 29:24.838
Do you want me to help you?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.300
I won't hurt you.

29:33.556 --> 29:34.773
Are you hungry?

29:53.534 --> 29:55.577
I gotta get you out of here.

29:55.578 --> 29:58.377
Dad will shoot you if he sees you.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.531
Everything's going to be all right.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.576
It's okay.

30:40.331 --> 30:41.127
Come on.

30:43.334 --> 30:44.130
Come on!

30:49.381 --> 30:52.430
I know what will get you out of here.

30:56.430 --> 30:57.226
Come on.

30:59.350 --> 31:01.318
It's a Christmas cookie.

31:21.121 --> 31:21.917
Come on.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.625
Come on, you can do it.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.248
Come on.

32:03.831 --> 32:04.627
Come on.

32:06.876 --> 32:07.672
Come on.

32:12.381 --> 32:13.507
You can do it.

32:20.389 --> 32:22.107
That's it, that's it.

32:23.225 --> 32:24.601
Come on, over here.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.291
Come on.

32:46.874 --> 32:51.004
I'll get more cookies but
you gotta come in here first.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.592
That's it, come on, come on.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.127
You gotta let me.

33:38.342 --> 33:42.438
I'll get more help, but you
got to stay here till then.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.659
- Come on, we're going to miss our bus.

34:04.660 --> 34:05.456
- Coming.

34:14.335 --> 34:16.304
- You forgot the dishes
last night, Jessica.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.342
- Sorry, dad.

34:20.384 --> 34:23.344
- Something's been
eating our little trees.

34:23.344 --> 34:24.312
- Which?

34:24.313 --> 34:27.556
- The little chestnuts.

34:27.558 --> 34:29.141
- What do you think it was?

34:29.143 --> 34:29.983
- Oh, I don't know.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.024
From the looks of the droppings

34:31.025 --> 34:33.819
I'd say it might have been a deer.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.190
- Must have been hungry
if it was eating wood.

34:37.192 --> 34:38.034
- Wood.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.404
That's what they eat.

34:39.405 --> 34:42.612
If I see 'em do it,
they'll be eating lead.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.831
- See you, dad.

35:06.847 --> 35:08.723
- Forgot my homework.

35:08.724 --> 35:09.644
- Too late now.

35:09.645 --> 35:10.483
- 1 got to.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.268
- Then you'll have to walk.

35:12.269 --> 35:13.145
- Go ahead!

35:14.646 --> 35:15.897
See ya later!

35:15.898 --> 35:18.617
- Not if I see you first!

35:44.676 --> 35:46.974
- This isn't a very healthy breakfast,

35:46.975 --> 35:50.431
but it'll have to do until
I can get you some hay.

35:50.432 --> 35:53.151
And you did eat our little trees.

35:56.146 --> 35:59.857
Oh, Prancer, you're
getting worse and worse.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.826
I'm going for some help.

36:10.077 --> 36:11.285
- You okay?

36:11.286 --> 36:12.082
- Benton!

36:14.206 --> 36:15.332
Doctor Benton!

36:17.584 --> 36:18.506
Doctor Benton!

36:18.507 --> 36:20.425
- Whatever it is can wait til tomorrow.

36:20.426 --> 36:22.046
I've been up all night.

36:22.047 --> 36:22.969
- Can't wait!

36:22.970 --> 36:24.090
Emergency!!

36:25.634 --> 36:26.430
Please?

36:27.511 --> 36:28.979
Just come, please.

36:35.853 --> 36:39.027
I brought someone to help you, Prancer.

36:40.774 --> 36:43.493
- Oh, my God, if it's a reindeer.

36:51.201 --> 36:53.786
You tricked me into this.

36:53.787 --> 36:55.163
- Uh-uh.

36:55.164 --> 36:56.757
I said there's an animal
that needs your help

36:56.758 --> 36:58.666
and that's the truth.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.214
I think he's dying.

37:07.634 --> 37:09.760
Where are you going?

37:09.761 --> 37:10.601
- I'm sorry.

37:10.602 --> 37:11.392
I can't.

37:12.472 --> 37:13.314
- You're a doctor.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.183
You're supposed to help animals.

37:15.184 --> 37:16.184
- Domestic animals.

37:16.185 --> 37:17.768
I thought it was a cow.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.191
- But he'll die!

37:19.192 --> 37:20.855
- Talk to mother nature.

37:20.856 --> 37:23.735
- Doctor Benton, this
is very, very important.

37:26.653 --> 37:28.030
You have no idea!

37:34.786 --> 37:36.162
No!

37:36.163 --> 37:36.959
He'll die!

37:39.583 --> 37:41.167
- Let go of my truck.

37:41.168 --> 37:43.294
- He's one of Santa's.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.630
Prancer, actually.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.341
- I'm so glad to hear that.

37:48.342 --> 37:49.182
- It is!

37:49.183 --> 37:50.553
- Would you please stop?
- It's Prancer.

37:50.554 --> 37:51.928
If you don't help,

37:51.929 --> 37:54.305
he'll never make it
back home by Christmas.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.146
- Would you please stop doing that?

37:55.147 --> 37:56.435
- Maybe there won't…
- Your dad's going…

37:56.436 --> 37:57.400
- Even be a Christmas…
- To hear about this.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.143
- If he doesn't get back.

38:05.025 --> 38:09.362
- Young lady, I was up half
the night with a pregnant cow

38:09.363 --> 38:11.239
and a crazy horse.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.288
I'm tired, my hand hurts,

38:14.534 --> 38:16.624
I've got a sick wife to tend to.

38:16.625 --> 38:18.338
I can't help you.
- But I'm telling you.

38:18.339 --> 38:20.331
He's one of Santa's!

38:20.332 --> 38:21.800
- Then call Santa!

38:22.918 --> 38:24.636
And let go of my car.

38:29.258 --> 38:31.636
- Probably couldn't help him anyways.

38:31.637 --> 38:33.512
Doctors are just liars.

38:34.554 --> 38:37.306
They never make anyone better!

38:47.317 --> 38:48.693
Is he going to be okay?

38:48.694 --> 38:50.111
- Too soon to tell.

38:50.112 --> 38:52.280
Should take a while to heal.

38:52.281 --> 38:53.783
Hold his head away from me.

38:53.784 --> 38:55.658
- I really don't think this is necessary.

38:55.659 --> 38:58.828
He's probably used to being around people.

38:58.829 --> 39:00.454
- What am I, an elf?

39:00.455 --> 39:01.789
Hold his head down.

39:01.790 --> 39:04.417
And keep that on after I leave, you hear?

39:04.418 --> 39:05.214
They bite.

39:10.882 --> 39:15.886
- Isn't he the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?

39:15.887 --> 39:18.015
- Like a cow with antlers.

39:23.812 --> 39:27.398
Don't know what a reindeer
is doing this far south.

39:27.399 --> 39:29.948
Must have escaped from that Christmas show

39:29.949 --> 39:32.236
over at Riverdales.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.409
I'll give 'em a call.

39:33.410 --> 39:34.488
' No!

39:34.489 --> 39:36.741
Please, I don't want anybody to know.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.664
Especially daddy.

39:37.665 --> 39:39.502
I don't think he'd understand.

39:39.503 --> 39:42.163
- I gotta give 'em a call just in case.

39:42.164 --> 39:43.541
But I'll make you a deal.

39:43.542 --> 39:47.636
I'll give you a couple days
to tell your father yourself.

39:49.504 --> 39:50.300
- Deal.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.303
History's going to love you for this.

39:57.304 --> 39:58.851
- Oh, go to school.

40:00.766 --> 40:01.562
- School!

40:03.310 --> 40:04.150
- I swear I don't know

40:04.151 --> 40:05.487
what you're thinking about half the time.

40:05.488 --> 40:07.857
Your head's always off
in the clouds somewhere!

40:07.858 --> 40:10.316
You don't just show up for
school when you feel like it!

40:10.317 --> 40:11.737
- It's almost vacation, anyway,

40:11.738 --> 40:13.863
and all I missed was finger
painting and I didn't see…

40:13.864 --> 40:15.701
- That's the very thing I'm talking about!

40:15.702 --> 40:17.493
The very thing I'm worried about!

40:17.494 --> 40:19.289
I've gotta go off to Benton Harbor tonight

40:19.290 --> 40:22.370
and who knows what you're gonna get up to.

40:22.371 --> 40:24.874
You going to tell me why you were late?

40:24.875 --> 40:26.832
Are you listening to me?

40:26.833 --> 40:27.629
- No.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.134
- You're not?

40:30.135 --> 40:31.675
- No, I mean, I'm not going to tell you

40:31.676 --> 40:33.799
why I was late for school.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.258
- Fine.

40:36.259 --> 40:37.636
Have it your way.

40:43.892 --> 40:44.768
- Hello.

40:44.769 --> 40:45.894
Mister Benton?

40:47.437 --> 40:49.235
This is Jessica Riggs.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.113
- Yes.

40:51.114 --> 40:51.902
What?

40:51.903 --> 40:52.776
Huh?

40:52.777 --> 40:54.073
- Jessica Riggs.

40:57.447 --> 41:00.041
I was wondering if you
called the Christmas show.

41:00.042 --> 41:02.701
- Yes, it's not theirs.

41:02.702 --> 41:04.495
- Thanks, sir.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.292
I knew it.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.750
- Darnedest thing.

41:09.751 --> 41:12.220
Where did that deer come from?

41:13.130 --> 41:15.297
- I have to babysit my crazy sister.

41:15.298 --> 41:16.924
Of course I've got her locked in her room,

41:16.925 --> 41:20.896
so I probably could just
sneak out of the house.

41:22.431 --> 41:24.978
She's on a mission to find some reindeer.

41:24.979 --> 41:27.103
My dad almost made a
road pizza out of him,

41:27.104 --> 41:29.230
but she thinks he can fly.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.818
No, not my dad, the reindeer.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.260
- Suppertime.

42:01.678 --> 42:04.477
This is the part I told you about.

42:06.516 --> 42:09.268
You tear apart the baby's rattle,

42:09.269 --> 42:12.396
see what makes noise inside.

42:12.397 --> 42:15.441
But there's a veil
covering the unseen world

42:15.442 --> 42:19.163
which not the strongest
man could tear apart.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.288
No Santa Claus?

42:23.783 --> 42:27.913
Thank God he lives and lives
forever 1,000 years from now.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.963
10 times 10,000 years from now.

42:34.377 --> 42:38.507
He'll continue to make glad
the heart of childhood.

42:41.718 --> 42:44.929
I can't read as good as my mom did.

42:44.930 --> 42:48.230
But you understand what it means, right?

42:50.894 --> 42:55.024
I bet Santa doesn't think
you'll get back in time.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.072
I better let him know.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.574
I love you, Prancer.

43:05.742 --> 43:06.538
But!

43:07.911 --> 43:08.911
What about me?

43:08.912 --> 43:10.129
Do you love me?

43:24.219 --> 43:25.427
Say cheese!

43:46.533 --> 43:47.950
- Did you get that?

43:47.951 --> 43:49.994
- Ho ho ho, little buddy.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.370
Of course I did.

43:51.371 --> 43:53.920
Let's see, Skeletor, slime pit,

43:56.751 --> 43:58.879
skateboard, and handcuffs.

44:00.630 --> 44:01.672
- Right.

44:01.673 --> 44:03.048
- Ho ho ho.

44:03.049 --> 44:04.346
Merry Christmas.

44:06.886 --> 44:07.728
Whoa!

44:07.729 --> 44:10.190
You're getting kind of
heavy for Santa's lap,

44:10.191 --> 44:12.058
aren't you little girl?

44:12.976 --> 44:13.816
- I'm sorry.

44:13.817 --> 44:14.935
I don't have any time for chitchat.

44:14.936 --> 44:16.937
I know you're not the real Santa.

44:16.938 --> 44:18.147
- Whoa.

44:18.148 --> 44:19.231
Of course I am.

44:19.232 --> 44:21.572
- But can you get this letter to him?

44:21.573 --> 44:23.946
- Why don't you just put a stamp on it

44:23.947 --> 44:25.490
and drop it in the mailbox?

44:25.491 --> 44:26.697
- It's too late for that.

44:26.698 --> 44:27.698
Please believe me.

44:27.699 --> 44:30.828
This is a matter of utmost importance.

44:32.287 --> 44:35.581
Prancer's in the shed near my house!

44:35.582 --> 44:37.425
I plan to take him to Antler Ridge

44:37.426 --> 44:39.636
on December 23rd, midnight.

44:42.130 --> 44:44.673
- All that's in the letter?

44:44.674 --> 44:45.969
- Here's a picture of him.

44:45.970 --> 44:49.014
That way Santa will know
you're telling the truth.

44:49.015 --> 44:50.888
- Do you think he'd doubt me?

44:50.889 --> 44:51.731
- Admit it.

44:51.732 --> 44:53.599
You're not the real Santa.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.059
- Okay, okay-

44:55.060 --> 44:56.518
Keep it to yourself.

44:56.519 --> 44:57.987
- Can you help me?

45:01.274 --> 45:05.027
- I'll do everything I possibly can.

45:05.028 --> 45:05.870
- Thanks.

45:05.871 --> 45:07.830
- Oh, wait a minute now.

45:08.990 --> 45:11.784
Is that all you want for Christmas?

45:11.785 --> 45:14.495
- Well, for now, anyways.

45:14.496 --> 45:16.715
I really don't want to live with my aunt,

45:16.716 --> 45:20.836
but I don't know if Santa
can do anything about that.

45:22.962 --> 45:25.681
- Can we hurry it
along a little bit, Santa?

45:25.682 --> 45:27.221
- Yes, sir.

45:30.095 --> 45:30.935
- Go on, honey.

45:30.936 --> 45:31.771
It's your turn.

45:31.772 --> 45:33.231
Go on up there, quick.

45:33.232 --> 45:34.473
There you go.

45:34.474 --> 45:35.270
- On!

45:36.935 --> 45:38.352
Well.

45:38.353 --> 45:40.321
And what do you want for Christmas,

45:40.322 --> 45:42.648
you little devil, you?

45:42.649 --> 45:45.243
- Put the Minot robbery on three,

45:45.244 --> 45:48.284
the farmers on welfare story on five.

45:51.116 --> 45:54.034
- I got something to cheer you up, pal.

45:54.035 --> 45:57.665
This will be perfect
for tomorrow's edition.

46:05.922 --> 46:08.298
- You've got to swear, Carol.

46:08.299 --> 46:09.676
- I said I would.

46:10.552 --> 46:12.395
- Cross your heart, swear not to tell.

46:12.396 --> 46:13.554
If you do, I'll…

46:13.555 --> 46:14.351
- I swear!

46:18.143 --> 46:19.309
- Ready?

46:19.310 --> 46:20.186
- I'm ready.

46:20.186 --> 46:20.982
I'm ready!

46:26.241 --> 46:27.110
Oh, my God!

46:29.028 --> 46:30.487
- It's Prancer.

46:30.488 --> 46:31.364
Go ahead.

46:31.365 --> 46:32.489
Pet him.

46:32.490 --> 46:33.330
- No.

46:33.331 --> 46:34.246
It's okay.

46:34.247 --> 46:36.288
I don't like animals that much, anyway.

46:36.289 --> 46:38.334
- Come on, that's not an animal.

46:38.335 --> 46:41.039
- What are you doing here?

46:41.040 --> 46:42.082
- It's a bird.

46:42.083 --> 46:42.923
It's a plane.

46:42.924 --> 46:43.759
It's a hat rack.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.836
- It's a reindeer, you nerd.

46:48.673 --> 46:52.217
- Looks like enough
meat to last the winter.

46:53.720 --> 46:54.762
Whoa!

46:54.763 --> 46:55.804
Hurt me.

46:55.805 --> 46:57.306
My knees are shaking.

46:57.307 --> 46:59.480
- If you tell clad, I'll
never speak to you again.

46:59.481 --> 47:01.185
- Is that a promise?

47:01.186 --> 47:02.186
Dad!

47:02.187 --> 47:03.270
Oh, dad!

47:03.271 --> 47:04.111
Hey, dad!

47:04.112 --> 47:05.106
Guess…

47:05.107 --> 47:06.356
- Shut up, Steve.

47:06.357 --> 47:07.199
- Shut up?

47:07.200 --> 47:08.525
- Look, I'll make you a deal.

47:08.526 --> 47:10.654
You don't tell dad and I'll
clean out the barn for you

47:10.655 --> 47:12.324
until the end of the year.

47:12.325 --> 47:14.290
- You're lousy at cleaning the barn.

47:14.291 --> 47:16.205
- Name your price, then.

47:17.243 --> 47:18.039
- Hm.

47:19.954 --> 47:23.254
I don't wanna wash any dishes till June.

47:26.711 --> 47:27.507
- Deal.

47:28.546 --> 47:30.088
- By the way,

47:30.089 --> 47:33.342
I wouldn't take any more feed
from the barn if I were you.

47:33.343 --> 47:36.386
- Now look,
Steve, he has to eat.

47:36.387 --> 47:38.727
- Well then you guys can buy some oats.

47:38.728 --> 47:39.807
- With what?

47:39.808 --> 47:40.648
- I don't know.

47:40.649 --> 47:42.144
- You wanna give us some money?

47:42.145 --> 47:43.941
- We don't have any money.
- You know,

47:43.942 --> 47:47.105
dad's noticed the missing hay.

47:47.106 --> 47:50.651
He thinks it's the deer getting in.

47:50.652 --> 47:51.617
He says he's going to…

47:51.618 --> 47:53.362
- Don't say the word.
- Be waiting with his gun.

47:55.657 --> 47:57.032
See you, Prancer.

47:57.033 --> 47:57.909
Bye, Carol.

47:59.536 --> 48:01.332
- I only need two more days.

48:01.333 --> 48:02.918
Then I'll take him up to Antler Ridge

48:02.919 --> 48:04.873
and Santa will come and get him.

48:04.874 --> 48:05.714
- He will?

48:05.715 --> 48:06.834
- Yeah, I sent him a letter.

48:06.835 --> 48:07.802
It's all worked out.

48:07.803 --> 48:11.338
- Kid isn't playing with a full deck.

48:11.339 --> 48:12.548
- Listen, Steve.

48:12.549 --> 48:15.259
Nobody, and I mean nobody but us three,

48:15.260 --> 48:16.762
can know about Prancer.

48:16.763 --> 48:18.303
- Don't worry.

48:18.304 --> 48:22.275
I wouldn't want anybody
to find out you're nuts.

48:25.562 --> 48:26.984
- No, Prancer, I have no cookies.

48:26.985 --> 48:31.110
If you didn't eat so fast,
you'd still have some hay left.

48:32.068 --> 48:34.491
Where am I going to
get the money for oats?

48:34.492 --> 48:37.114
They cost something like $15 a bag.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.907
- Don't look at me.

48:38.908 --> 48:40.831
I spent all mine on Christmas presents.

48:40.832 --> 48:42.494
- Maybe we can earn it.

48:42.495 --> 48:43.620
We're on vacation.

48:43.621 --> 48:44.918
We can get jobs.

48:45.790 --> 48:47.541
Don't worry, Prancer.

48:47.542 --> 48:49.419
I won't let you starve.

48:50.628 --> 48:51.424
- Jessie.

48:55.091 --> 48:58.686
Your Aunt Sarah's gonna be
staying over the next two nights.

48:58.687 --> 49:02.431
She wants to take you to church on Sunday,

49:02.432 --> 49:05.017
and Christmas shopping tomorrow.

49:05.018 --> 49:06.106
- I can't tomorrow.

49:06.107 --> 49:08.103
I got something important to do.

49:08.104 --> 49:10.314
- You stay with your Aunt Sarah.

49:10.315 --> 49:12.482
I got to go to town on business.

49:12.483 --> 49:13.405
I don't want to come back

49:13.406 --> 49:17.031
and hear you've been
giving her a hard time.

50:31.729 --> 50:33.276
- What do you want?

50:35.692 --> 50:38.696
- I came to apologize for trespassing

50:39.654 --> 50:42.282
and for messing up your flowers.

50:44.033 --> 50:45.993
- Well, I should think so.

50:45.994 --> 50:47.082
This isn't the first time

50:47.083 --> 50:49.672
you hooligans have torn up my property!

50:49.673 --> 50:51.081
- I know.

50:51.082 --> 50:52.082
I'm really sorry.

50:52.083 --> 50:53.672
- You should see my creeping bent

50:53.673 --> 50:55.261
in the summer, what they do.

50:55.262 --> 50:56.753
- I know!

50:56.754 --> 50:58.380
I know.

50:58.381 --> 51:00.424
Anyway, ma'am, I'm sorry.

51:00.425 --> 51:01.550
- Don't do it again,

51:01.551 --> 51:04.680
or I'll be forced to notify
the juvenile authorities.

51:04.681 --> 51:08.682
I'm sure you wouldn't enjoy a
month or two in reform school.

51:08.683 --> 51:09.650
- No, ma'am.

51:14.230 --> 51:15.106
No.

51:15.107 --> 51:19.192
While I'm here, ma'am, I'm
raising money for a good cause.

51:19.193 --> 51:20.160
And, well…

51:22.280 --> 51:26.324
I'm willing to do chores
for you for half price.

51:26.325 --> 51:27.622
- Raising money?

51:28.828 --> 51:30.045
For what cause?

51:31.456 --> 51:33.083
- An animal shelter.

51:36.169 --> 51:38.128
- What kind of chores?

51:38.129 --> 51:39.546
And how much?

51:39.547 --> 51:43.677
- I'll clean any room in your
house top to bottom for $5.

51:47.597 --> 51:48.473
- Any room?

51:50.391 --> 51:51.267
- Any room.

52:23.132 --> 52:28.095
- Been meaning to fix this
up for quite a while now.

52:28.096 --> 52:30.972
- This looks like a $10 job.

52:30.973 --> 52:33.192
- You said any room for $5.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.940
Now, this goes upstairs.

52:39.941 --> 52:40.908
This goes upstairs.

52:40.909 --> 52:42.818
You can leave this here.

52:42.819 --> 52:44.287
These go out back.

52:45.571 --> 52:47.948
These go in the closet under the stairs.

52:47.949 --> 52:50.418
This goes up on the top floor.

52:52.078 --> 52:52.874
Oh!

52:53.746 --> 52:55.372
These are still good.

52:56.541 --> 52:57.633
Keep that over there.

52:57.634 --> 53:00.094
This room needs a big dusting.

53:02.046 --> 53:02.842
Oh.

53:08.803 --> 53:10.137
These books.

53:10.138 --> 53:12.806
Put them in the bookcase.

53:12.807 --> 53:16.277
And this might

53:39.375 --> 53:40.171
Come on.

54:35.598 --> 54:36.565
Little girl.

54:42.939 --> 54:43.906
Little girl?

54:46.484 --> 54:47.451
Little girl.

54:54.700 --> 54:55.667
Little girl.

55:02.208 --> 55:03.585
Are you playing a game on me?

55:04.961 --> 55:05.837
- Surprise!

55:10.049 --> 55:11.141
- What's all this?

55:11.142 --> 55:13.093
- Aren't they beautiful?

55:13.094 --> 55:15.428
- Pack these up right away.

55:15.429 --> 55:16.269
- Why?

55:16.270 --> 55:17.265
- No, I don't want them.

55:17.265 --> 55:18.232
Pack them up.

55:18.233 --> 55:20.352
- But don't you like them?

55:21.269 --> 55:22.894
- No, I don't like them.

55:22.895 --> 55:25.316
- You used to win all of the lights awards

55:25.317 --> 55:26.985
for decorating your house.

55:26.986 --> 55:28.566
People came from miles around.

55:28.567 --> 55:29.818
- Why would I want people
to come from miles around

55:29.819 --> 55:30.986
to trample everything?

55:30.987 --> 55:32.330
- Because you have a beautiful house.

55:32.331 --> 55:35.532
- Well,
I'm not doing it anymore.

55:35.533 --> 55:36.329
- Please?

55:41.622 --> 55:42.418
Please?

55:54.385 --> 55:56.261
- To the left.

55:56.262 --> 55:57.102
No!

55:57.103 --> 55:57.892
My left!

56:10.401 --> 56:11.197
$5.

56:12.403 --> 56:13.871
And $10 makes $15.

56:18.117 --> 56:19.826
- We agreed on five.

56:19.827 --> 56:22.956
I know, but you did $15 worth of work.

56:24.540 --> 56:26.249
- Thanks, Mrs. McFarland.

56:26.250 --> 56:29.586
- Let's go in for those cookies and milk.

56:29.587 --> 56:31.421
- I got to go.

56:31.422 --> 56:33.675
- But you said you were
going to stay a while.

56:33.676 --> 56:37.010
- I got something important to do.

56:37.011 --> 56:38.511
- Fine!

56:38.512 --> 56:39.479
Be that way.

56:51.908 --> 56:52.777
- I was so worried,

56:52.778 --> 56:54.279
I looked for her all day.

56:54.280 --> 56:57.248
She took off early this morning
and she didn't say a word.

56:57.249 --> 56:59.240
- I'll talk to her.

56:59.241 --> 57:00.117
It's spite.

57:42.201 --> 57:43.952
- Dear Santa Claus,

57:43.953 --> 57:45.546
don't worry about Prancer.

57:45.547 --> 57:46.955
He's in good hands.

57:46.956 --> 57:50.333
He was hurt, but I helped him to get well.

57:50.334 --> 57:52.961
I will bring him to you
at the top of Antler Ridge

57:52.962 --> 57:57.090
at midnight on Sunday, the
night before Christmas Eve.

57:57.091 --> 58:00.220
That way you will have plenty of time.

58:01.220 --> 58:06.015
If you don't want me to see
you, I'll close my eyes.

58:06.016 --> 58:08.768
But I do want to see you.

58:08.769 --> 58:10.396
Love, Jessica Riggs.

58:53.898 --> 58:55.315
- How is it, honey?

58:55.316 --> 58:56.983
Does it fit you?

58:56.984 --> 58:58.861
- Very well, thank you.

59:01.530 --> 59:02.697
- 10 minutes.

59:02.698 --> 59:03.663
- Come on, man.

59:03.664 --> 59:04.497
Hurry UP-

59:04.498 --> 59:05.334
' Be quiet.

59:05.335 --> 59:06.623
She can hear us.

59:08.913 --> 59:10.079
- Oh, my God.

59:11.874 --> 59:12.921
- Here he is.

59:14.752 --> 59:15.835
- He's big.

59:15.836 --> 59:16.676
- Oh, wow.

59:16.677 --> 59:17.466
He's rad!

59:18.923 --> 59:21.142
- Okay, Quinn, what are you doing here?

59:21.143 --> 59:22.300
- Hey! twigs.

59:22.301 --> 59:24.844
Just wanted to see the famous Prancer.

59:24.845 --> 59:26.262
- Prancer?

59:26.263 --> 59:27.472
Who told you?

59:27.473 --> 59:28.313
- Nobody.

59:28.314 --> 59:29.103
I just saw…

59:29.104 --> 59:30.939
- I'm going to strangle that Carol.

59:30.940 --> 59:32.274
- Look at his weird feet.

59:32.275 --> 59:33.770
- And those eyes.

59:33.771 --> 59:35.813
- He's so ugly.

59:35.814 --> 59:36.898
' Yeah.

59:36.899 --> 59:38.066
<i>'</i> Out!

59:38.067 --> 59:39.112
Come out!
- Hey, watch it!

59:39.113 --> 59:40.235
- Take it easy.
- That thing is sharp!

59:40.236 --> 59:41.738
- What's wrong with you?

59:41.739 --> 59:43.738
Out, out!
- She's crazy, man.

59:43.739 --> 59:46.908
- I'm gonna slice you into little pieces!

59:46.909 --> 59:47.874
Out!

59:47.875 --> 59:48.790
Get away!

59:48.791 --> 59:49.912
Get, get, get!

59:50.913 --> 59:53.462
Shoo and never come back again!

01:00:03.425 --> 01:00:05.635
You're not ugly, Prancer.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:08.435
Don't let those creeps bother you.

01:00:09.932 --> 01:00:12.809
I'm going to strangle that Carol.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.278
All right for her.

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:48.852
- All I'm saying

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.597
is you better get that
reindeer out of the shed soon.

01:00:50.598 --> 01:00:51.438
- I am.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.272
Tonight.

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.939
Pretty soon everyone's
gonna know about him.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.730
I can't believe Carol told.

01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:56.853
- Hello, Jessica.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:59.397
- Hi, Mrs. Fairburn.

01:00:59.398 --> 01:01:02.233
Aunt Sarah, this is my
teacher, Mrs. Fairburn.

01:01:02.234 --> 01:01:03.201
- Oh, hello.

01:01:04.153 --> 01:01:05.695
- You must be so proud of her.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:06.536
- Oh, well, yes.

01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:07.370
We always are.

01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:08.411
- I want to hear all about it.

01:01:08.412 --> 01:01:10.876
I'll talk to you after church.

01:01:11.994 --> 01:01:13.161
- Good morning.

01:01:13.162 --> 01:01:14.038
- Good morning, reverend.

01:01:14.039 --> 01:01:16.539
- Merry Christmas.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.916
Well, well, well, well, well.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:22.967
You have added inspiration
to my day, young lady.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.268
- What'd you do, hand out money?

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:32.356
- I don't have any idea
what they're talking about.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.300
- That brought again

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.640
from the dead our Lord Jesus,

01:02:52.641 --> 01:02:55.226
through the blood of the
everlasting covenant,

01:02:55.227 --> 01:02:58.563
make you perfect in every
good work to do his will,

01:02:58.564 --> 01:03:01.608
working in you that which
is pleasing in his sight

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:04.573
through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:16.036
<i>♫ Hark, the herald angels sing ♫</i>

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:20.791

<i>♫ Glory to the newborn king ♫</i>

01:04:14.176 --> 01:04:16.848
- And the Angel
of the Lord came upon them,

01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:19.894
and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them,

01:04:19.895 --> 01:04:21.641
and they were so afraid.

01:04:21.642 --> 01:04:24.477
And the angel said unto them, "Fear not."

01:05:30.043 --> 01:05:32.262
- What's the matter, Ralph?

01:06:04.202 --> 01:06:07.246

<i>♫ How great thou art ♫</i>

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:22.196
- And now a final community note.

01:07:22.197 --> 01:07:25.199
We have someone very special

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.619
in our congregation this morning.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.462
Those of you who have read

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:33.499
this morning's Sunday newspaper
know who I'm talking about.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.671
But for those of you who haven't,

01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:37.888
I'd like to read part of an editorial

01:07:37.889 --> 01:07:41.549
that appears in the family section.

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.384
It may help to inspire you

01:07:43.385 --> 01:07:45.934
in the same way that it did me.

01:07:47.014 --> 01:07:49.733
In an electronic age where
children are growing up

01:07:49.734 --> 01:07:52.435
light-years faster than their ancestors

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:54.188
ever dreamed possible,

01:07:55.897 --> 01:07:57.865
where the harsh realities of everyday life

01:07:57.866 --> 01:08:01.988
have invaded even the most
idyllic of communities,

01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:05.290
it is inspiring to see that some children

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:09.412
are able to hold on to their
dreams and innocent spirit.

01:08:10.912 --> 01:08:15.042
Yes, Santa, there are still
Virginias in this world.

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:18.966
We have one right here in Three Oaks.

01:08:20.087 --> 01:08:23.466
She's nursing the spirit
of Christmas back to health

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.060
the same way as she's nursed

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.100
your missing reindeer back to health.

01:08:29.014 --> 01:08:31.807
Please stop by soon to collect Prancer.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:34.310
Until then, he's in good hands.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:37.531
Three Oaks is in good hands

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:42.693
as long as we have children
like Jessica Riggs,

01:08:42.694 --> 01:08:46.163
with all their sense of wonder and belief.

01:08:47.741 --> 01:08:50.242
We need that belief.

01:08:50.243 --> 01:08:52.328
The world needs it.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.956
May it live forever.

01:09:09.136 --> 01:09:09.933
- Oh, man.

01:09:16.812 --> 01:09:17.654
- Oh, no.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.444
Dad's probably reading it right now.

01:09:30.908 --> 01:09:32.035
- Whoa, Janet!

01:09:33.245 --> 01:09:34.041
Dumb cow.

01:09:51.345 --> 01:09:52.598
- Prancer!

01:09:52.599 --> 01:09:56.602
- Where's Prancer?

01:09:58.103 --> 01:09:59.400
- We have to find him first.

01:09:59.401 --> 01:10:01.694
- Let's go this way.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:03.732
- Nobody's here.

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:04.573
- Hi, John.

01:10:04.574 --> 01:10:06.159
Hope you don't mind us
barging in like this.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:06.995
- Oh, no.

01:10:06.996 --> 01:10:08.785
- There he is.

01:10:11.116 --> 01:10:12.825
- Look, there he is.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:14.627
HEY, YOU guys, look.

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:17.705
He's over here, he's in the house.

01:10:59.206 --> 01:11:01.254
- He's got a gun!

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.210
- Don't shoot!

01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:05.178
Don't shoot!

01:11:07.672 --> 01:11:11.142
I want to make a proposition to you, John.

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:16.977
- Holy cow.

01:11:19.768 --> 01:11:20.608
- Oh, no.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:21.398
He's gone.

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:23.605
Daddy, where is he?

01:11:23.605 --> 01:11:24.525
Did you kill him?

01:11:24.526 --> 01:11:26.864
- You had that deer out in
that shed all week, didn't you?

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:27.700
- Tell us, daddy.

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:29.985
- That's why you skipped school.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:32.533
You gave him food from
the barn, telling lies.

01:11:32.534 --> 01:11:34.624
Then I find a 40 pound
sack of oats out there

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.992
with a Christmas bow on it!

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.538
Do you wanna tell me where that came from?

01:11:38.539 --> 01:11:39.458
Did you steal that, too?

01:11:39.459 --> 01:11:40.668
- No, she bought it with…

01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:42.166
- You were in on this, too, huh?

01:11:42.167 --> 01:11:43.585
I'll get to you later.

01:11:43.586 --> 01:11:44.667
- Daddy!

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:46.466
- Sit down to read the
newspaper for a change

01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:48.337
and all heck breaks loose.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.931
Darned deer lets the stock out

01:11:49.932 --> 01:11:52.007
then comes into the house!

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.926
I got too much on my mind for all this.

01:11:53.927 --> 01:11:55.179
You kids are making me nuts.
- Daddy, you didn't shoot him.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.771
Tell me you didn't shoot him.

01:11:56.772 --> 01:11:58.347
- I didn't shoot it.

01:11:58.348 --> 01:11:59.390
- You didn't?

01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:00.599
- No, I didn't.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.850
- Really?

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:02.977
- No, I didn't.

01:12:02.978 --> 01:12:04.728
- Oh, thank you, daddy.

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:05.605
Did he run away?

01:12:05.605 --> 01:12:06.447
Which way did he go?

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:07.656
Did he go to Antler Ridge?

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.441
- Down at Three Oaks.

01:12:09.442 --> 01:12:10.362
I sold him.

01:12:10.363 --> 01:12:11.327
- Sold him?

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:12.987
- To Herb Drier.

01:12:12.988 --> 01:12:16.031
He offered me $200 to
take him off my hands.

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:18.534
- Mister Drier, the butcher?

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.244
Daddy, he'll eat him!

01:12:20.245 --> 01:12:21.085
- No, he won't.

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:21.955
- He's a butcher, daddy.

01:12:21.956 --> 01:12:24.170
He'll cut him up and sell the pieces.

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:25.332
- Now stop it.

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:26.175
- No, I won't.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.419
You don't understand what you've done.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.717
He's one of Santa's.

01:12:29.718 --> 01:12:31.839
- Oh, come on, Jessie!

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.134
- Mom would've never done this.

01:12:35.135 --> 01:12:37.511
- Look, a reindeer don't fly, okay?

01:12:37.512 --> 01:12:40.482
I hate to be the one to tell
you that, but they don't.

01:12:40.483 --> 01:12:43.101
- I'll shoot her instead of you.

01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:47.856
Die, I'm gonna die.

01:12:49.107 --> 01:12:53.237
- Oh, John, you really
didn't do that, did you?

01:13:07.876 --> 01:13:09.835
- Where is he, Mister Drier?

01:13:09.836 --> 01:13:10.678
- Where's who?

01:13:10.679 --> 01:13:11.962
- Prancer!

01:13:11.963 --> 01:13:13.010
- Over there.

01:13:20.847 --> 01:13:21.643
- Prancer.

01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:25.815
You're alive.

01:13:33.401 --> 01:13:34.777
- I saved his life.

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:37.404
Now he's my best salesman.

01:13:37.405 --> 01:13:38.873
Aren't you, fella?

01:13:52.003 --> 01:13:53.962
Nobody answer that.

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.681
I'm tired of having to
explain to everybody

01:13:55.682 --> 01:13:57.721
why I sold that reindeer.

01:14:00.053 --> 01:14:03.097
- May I be excused, please?

01:14:03.098 --> 01:14:04.315
- Yes, you may.

01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:15.192
- Sorry about the mess
he made in the house.

01:14:15.193 --> 01:14:18.788
I'll do the dishes after
everyone's through.

01:15:14.335 --> 01:15:15.755
- Where do you think you're going?

01:15:15.756 --> 01:15:17.217
- None of your beeswax.

01:15:17.218 --> 01:15:19.341
- You're heading for town
at night in a snowstorm

01:15:19.342 --> 01:15:21.383
and it's none of my business?

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.102
You're gonna try and spring Prancer.

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:24.511
- So what if I am?

01:15:24.512 --> 01:15:25.354
- I just wondered

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:29.317
why do you need a sack
full of clothes to do it.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:34.188
Come on, Jessie, what are the clothes for?

01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:35.031
You're gonna tell me what you're doing

01:15:35.032 --> 01:15:36.991
or I'm gonna go get dad.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.068
- I'm not coming back.

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:41.528
- Boy, that's just great.

01:15:41.529 --> 01:15:42.496
Come on, Jessie.

01:15:42.497 --> 01:15:44.031
Come back to the house.

01:15:44.032 --> 01:15:45.949
Come on, don't be crazy.

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:49.745
HEY, are you going to make me drag you?

01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:50.793
- Go ahead, drag me.

01:15:50.794 --> 01:15:53.758
I'll just find another way to leave.

01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:56.793
- Am I the only sane
one left in this family?

01:15:56.794 --> 01:15:57.841
- Look, Steve, I'm not going

01:15:57.842 --> 01:16:00.839
to ever, ever live with Aunt Sarah.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.924
- Aunt Sarah?

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.095
- Dad wants to send me there

01:16:03.096 --> 01:16:05.093
and I really don't want to go.

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.428
- He does?

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:09.056
Why is everyone keeping me
in the dark about everything?

01:16:09.057 --> 01:16:10.477
- I didn't think you'd care.

01:16:10.478 --> 01:16:11.315
- Of course I do.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:12.809
- I thought
maybe you might be glad.

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:13.652
- Of course not.

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:14.737
Now come on back, Jess.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.730
We'll work this out.

01:16:16.731 --> 01:16:18.449
- Dad doesn't want me.

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:19.983
- Sure, he does.

01:16:19.984 --> 01:16:21.780
- He doesn't treat me right.

01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:23.699
- He's just mixed up right now.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.198
- He doesn't love me,
doesn't understand me.

01:16:26.199 --> 01:16:28.951
- Maybe he doesn't
understand you all the time.

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:29.874
I don't either.

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:32.748
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:36.630
Come on, come on home.

01:16:36.631 --> 01:16:38.048
I'm tired of talking about this.

01:16:38.049 --> 01:16:39.962
- I can't, Steve.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:44.093
With Prancer gone, there's
nothing left for me in this town.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.476
Bye, Steve.

01:17:33.308 --> 01:17:36.602
- Figured you might need
some help with the jailbreak.

01:17:36.603 --> 01:17:37.570
Don't think I'm gonna try

01:17:37.571 --> 01:17:39.690
and talk you out of running away anymore.

01:17:39.691 --> 01:17:43.609
Whatever you wanna do is fine with me.

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:44.907
- Thanks, Steve.

01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:05.464
- We gotta hurry.

01:18:05.465 --> 01:18:07.092
Bert makes his rounds every half an hour.

01:18:07.093 --> 01:18:08.884
You be the lookout.

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:56.431
Where were you?

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:57.399
- I didn't see it.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.856
- Get back to your post.

01:18:58.857 --> 01:18:59.896
- No, let me help.

01:18:59.897 --> 01:19:02.067
The snow's too thick for looking out.

01:19:02.068 --> 01:19:06.193
- If you don't get back to
your post we're going home.

01:19:29.674 --> 01:19:31.007
' Hey, Steve!

01:19:31.008 --> 01:19:31.804
UP here!

01:19:35.346 --> 01:19:36.847
- What are you doing?

01:19:36.848 --> 01:19:38.765
What the heck are you doing?

01:19:38.766 --> 01:19:42.227
- Prying the roof off
so Prancer can jump out.

01:19:42.228 --> 01:19:45.397
- Too high for you and
it's too high for him.

01:19:45.398 --> 01:19:47.107
- He's Prancer, Steve.

01:19:47.108 --> 01:19:49.657
Maybe we'll get to see him fly.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.036
- Get down!

01:19:59.537 --> 01:20:00.663
- No.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:15.720
Come on, Prancer.

01:20:16.971 --> 01:20:17.767
Come on.

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:20.393
You're all better now.

01:20:20.394 --> 01:20:22.189
There's nothing holding you back.

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:24.060
Prancer, come on.

01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:25.153
We don't have much time.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.439
It's quarter till 12.

01:20:28.816 --> 01:20:30.193
Prancer, come on!

01:20:32.236 --> 01:20:33.487
Look, Steve.

01:20:33.488 --> 01:20:36.037
He's gonna fly, he's gonna fly.

01:20:37.575 --> 01:20:38.542
Steve, look!

01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:54.382
- It's Bert.

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:55.305
Stay put.

01:20:55.306 --> 01:20:58.521
Maybe he won't see you in all the snow.

01:21:48.145 --> 01:21:50.021
- Hey, Prancer.

01:21:50.022 --> 01:21:51.982
How you doing tonight, huh?

01:21:51.983 --> 01:21:54.077
Nice weather we're having here, huh?

01:21:57.238 --> 01:21:58.822
- How about that?

01:21:58.823 --> 01:21:59.619
Yeah.

01:22:00.825 --> 01:22:02.450
Oh, boy'

01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:04.786
Well, we'll see you on our next run

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:07.916
and I'll bring you something
real good to eat, too, okay?

01:22:07.917 --> 01:22:09.082
Okay.

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:10.209
See you later.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:31.652
- Stay put!

01:22:31.653 --> 01:22:32.773
I'm coming up!

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:48.628
Jessie!

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.253
Jessie!

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:00.555
Bert!

01:23:01.385 --> 01:23:02.307
Bert, wait!

01:23:02.308 --> 01:23:03.805
Bert!

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:06.556
Wait, Bert, stop!

01:23:06.557 --> 01:23:08.350
Bert, my sister's hurt!

01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:09.809
Wait!

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:11.061
Bert!

01:23:11.062 --> 01:23:11.904
Come back!

01:23:13.147 --> 01:23:14.272
She's hurt!

01:23:14.273 --> 01:23:15.069
Wait!

01:23:15.983 --> 01:23:17.484
Come back, Bert!

01:24:40.985 --> 01:24:41.827
Are you sure?

01:24:41.828 --> 01:24:45.164
I think maybe she came home
from the hospital too soon.

01:24:45.165 --> 01:24:48.116
I know the X-Rays turned out alright.

01:24:48.117 --> 01:24:50.702
She's still not feeling well.

01:24:50.703 --> 01:24:52.205
Things are blurry when she looks at 'em.

01:24:52.206 --> 01:24:54.080
She doesn't want to get out of bed.

01:24:54.081 --> 01:24:56.675
She doesn't want to play
her Christmas records.

01:24:56.676 --> 01:24:58.752
Oh, no, you don't understand.

01:24:58.753 --> 01:25:03.006
My daughter plays
Christmas records all year.

01:25:03.007 --> 01:25:03.883
Yeah, okay.

01:25:05.718 --> 01:25:06.514
I will.

01:25:14.435 --> 01:25:17.020
- How are you feeling, honey?

01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:20.565
Things still look a little funny to you?

01:25:20.566 --> 01:25:21.362
- Sort of.

01:25:32.119 --> 01:25:33.620
- Tomorrow when your uncle and I come over

01:25:33.621 --> 01:25:34.964
for Christmas dinner,

01:25:34.965 --> 01:25:38.917
we'll all get bundled up and
we'll go and see Prancer.

01:25:38.918 --> 01:25:42.218
- I don't want to see that deer anymore.

01:25:44.131 --> 01:25:46.302
- What on earth are you talking about?

01:25:46.303 --> 01:25:47.392
- Everyone was right.

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:50.970
Don't know why it took
me so long to listen.

01:25:50.971 --> 01:25:53.515
- I don't understand, Jessie.

01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:56.893
- It's just a deer, Aunt Sarah.

01:25:56.894 --> 01:25:59.022
- What would make you say such a thing?

01:25:59.023 --> 01:26:01.523
After all that you've done for him,

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:04.317
after what he did for you last night?

01:26:04.318 --> 01:26:08.448
Why, I bet Santa's coming
to get him tonight.

01:26:10.825 --> 01:26:12.742
- You don't have to pretend.

01:26:12.743 --> 01:26:13.710
Dad's right.

01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:15.830
I'm almost nine years old.

01:26:18.124 --> 01:26:20.502
It's time I grew up a little.

01:26:45.317 --> 01:26:47.902
- Hey, John, how are you?

01:26:47.903 --> 01:26:49.120
What you doing down here?

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.739
- I was just checking on the reindeer.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.866
- You ought to go up to your house

01:26:52.867 --> 01:26:54.289
'cause there's gonna be a party there.

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:55.502
- Uh.

01:26:56.453 --> 01:26:57.745
- Dumb.

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:00.540
It was supposed to be a surprise party.

01:27:00.541 --> 01:27:01.383
- A what?

01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:05.505
- Just between you and I,
it's a party for Jessie.

01:27:06.505 --> 01:27:09.007
So, we'll see you out there, okay?

01:27:09.008 --> 01:27:09.848
- Well, yeah.

01:27:09.849 --> 01:27:10.684
Sure I'll be there.

01:27:10.685 --> 01:27:11.801
- Okay.

01:27:11.802 --> 01:27:12.598
- Yeah.

01:27:14.555 --> 01:27:16.683
- Don't hit me in front of people.

01:27:16.684 --> 01:27:18.650
I outrank you, you know.

01:27:29.403 --> 01:27:30.404
<i>♫ Oh Tannenbaum ♫</i>

01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:37.202
<i>♫ Thy leaves are so unchanging ♫</i>

01:27:37.203 --> 01:27:41.748

<i>♫ We wish you a merry Christmas ♫</i>

01:28:40.266 --> 01:28:42.731
- I found this at the Christmas tree lot.

01:28:42.732 --> 01:28:44.194
<i>♫ We wish you a merry Christmas ♫</i>

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:46.312
<i>♫ And a happy new year ♫</i>

01:28:46.313 --> 01:28:48.439
<i>♫ Good tidings we bring ♫</i>

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.941
<i>♫ To you and your kin ♫</i>
- Merry Christmas!

01:28:49.942 --> 01:28:50.782
Merry Christmas!

01:28:50.783 --> 01:28:51.616
Please come in!

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:52.735
<i>♫ Good tidings for Christmas ♫</i>

01:28:52.736 --> 01:28:55.780
<i>♫ And a happy new year ♫</i>

01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:59.117
- I haven't got much to
give you this Christmas.

01:28:59.118 --> 01:29:00.335
- That's okay, daddy.

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:01.544
- No, it isn't.

01:29:04.957 --> 01:29:05.753
It isn't.

01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:10.216
I've been thinking.

01:29:14.425 --> 01:29:18.555
Maybe we could do some of
the things we used to do,

01:29:22.182 --> 01:29:23.559
you know, before?

01:29:25.602 --> 01:29:27.320
On other Christmases.

01:29:34.486 --> 01:29:36.534
You know that old sleigh?

01:29:37.489 --> 01:29:41.619
Remember the rides we used to
take in it every Christmas?

01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:45.538
Well, maybe we could
hook it up to old Ralph

01:29:45.539 --> 01:29:47.257
and do that tomorrow.

01:29:49.335 --> 01:29:51.212
- I'd like that, daddy.

01:30:00.387 --> 01:30:02.936
- I found this out in the shed.

01:30:18.697 --> 01:30:19.537
What?

01:30:19.538 --> 01:30:20.371
- Read it.

01:30:20.372 --> 01:30:21.208
Just this part.

01:30:21.209 --> 01:30:22.747
That's my favorite.

01:30:34.338 --> 01:30:37.340
- You tear apart the baby's rattle,

01:30:37.341 --> 01:30:40.641
and you see what makes the noise inside.

01:30:41.762 --> 01:30:45.598
But there is a veil
covering the unseen world,

01:30:45.599 --> 01:30:49.320
which not the strongest
man could tear apart.

01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:51.105
Only faith,

01:30:52.689 --> 01:30:53.485
poetry,

01:30:54.525 --> 01:30:55.902
love, and romance

01:30:57.653 --> 01:31:00.696
can push aside that curtain

01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:04.076
and view the beauty and the glory beyond.

01:31:09.289 --> 01:31:10.506
Is it all real?

01:31:13.335 --> 01:31:15.670
Virginia, in all this world,

01:31:15.671 --> 01:31:18.891
there is nothing else real and abiding.

01:31:20.384 --> 01:31:21.601
No Santa Claus?

01:31:23.095 --> 01:31:24.642
Thank God he lives,

01:31:26.098 --> 01:31:27.475
and lives forever

01:31:29.059 --> 01:31:31.394
1,000 years from now,

01:31:31.395 --> 01:31:33.944
10 times 10,000 years from now.

01:31:35.107 --> 01:31:39.237
He will continue to make
glad the heart of childhood.

01:31:40.654 --> 01:31:43.656
- I didn't really wanna run away.

01:31:43.657 --> 01:31:45.330
I just, I just wanted

01:31:48.328 --> 01:31:50.288
you to find me

01:31:50.289 --> 01:31:52.915
and bring me back here

01:31:52.916 --> 01:31:56.752
and tell me things were going to be okay,

01:31:56.753 --> 01:31:59.255
like they used to be.

01:31:59.256 --> 01:32:00.303
- Oh, Jessie.

01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:06.429
I can't tell you everything's
going to be all right.

01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:08.264
I wish I could.

01:32:08.265 --> 01:32:12.393
But I know things are always
going to be hard around here.

01:32:12.394 --> 01:32:16.397
Could even be we'll
lose this farm someday.

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:18.025
But I can bear that.

01:32:19.943 --> 01:32:21.820
What I can't bear is…

01:32:28.869 --> 01:32:31.338
when you were gone last night,

01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:34.591
I saw what it would be like around here

01:32:34.592 --> 01:32:36.460
not to have you around.

01:32:40.172 --> 01:32:42.423
I love you, Jessie.

01:32:42.424 --> 01:32:43.674
- I'm sorry.

01:32:43.675 --> 01:32:45.052
I'm sorry, daddy.

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:47.057
I'm sorry.

01:32:50.807 --> 01:32:52.684
I love you, too, daddy.

01:32:54.228 --> 01:32:55.445
- I know, baby.

01:32:56.730 --> 01:32:57.570
It's okay.

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:58.360
Don't cry.

01:32:59.483 --> 01:33:00.735
You're home, honey.

01:33:00.736 --> 01:33:03.613
And that's where you're gonna stay.

01:33:06.865 --> 01:33:09.744
I got something I want to show you.

01:33:17.709 --> 01:33:19.674
- How'd you get him?

01:33:19.675 --> 01:33:22.842
- Tracked Herb down and
gave him his money back.

01:33:22.843 --> 01:33:26.514
I think we still got time to
get him out to Antler Ridge.

01:33:26.515 --> 01:33:29.220
Santa hasn't been to Three Oaks yet.

01:33:29.221 --> 01:33:30.721
- You don't have to.

01:33:30.722 --> 01:33:33.015
I know he's really not Prancer.

01:33:33.016 --> 01:33:34.313
- You're gonna have a lot of trouble

01:33:34.314 --> 01:33:38.439
convincing all those
people downstairs of that.

01:33:40.566 --> 01:33:42.280
Move out of the way, everybody.

01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:45.361
We got a reindeer to get to
Antler Ridge by midnight.

01:33:45.362 --> 01:33:47.078
- I don't think this is
such a good idea, John.

01:33:47.079 --> 01:33:48.790
The doctor said that she
could get out of bed,

01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:51.078
but I don't think this
is what he had in mind.

01:33:51.079 --> 01:33:52.618
She still needs her rest.

01:33:52.619 --> 01:33:53.791
- I know what she needs, Sarah,

01:33:53.792 --> 01:33:56.336
and from now on she's gonna
be getting more of it.

01:34:10.554 --> 01:34:11.350
- Bye!

01:34:13.890 --> 01:34:15.187
- Bye, reindeer!

01:34:17.019 --> 01:34:19.898
- Merry Christmas, Prancer!

01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:24.001
- I wish I could keep
you for just my own pet.

01:35:25.087 --> 01:35:28.339
I'll always remember you, Prancer.

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:29.216
I love you.

01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:42.563
Thanks, Prancer, for everything.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.526
- Look.

01:36:36.283 --> 01:36:39.201
- Where did he go?

01:36:39.202 --> 01:36:40.578
- I don't know.

01:36:40.579 --> 01:36:42.206
He just disappeared.

01:36:46.001 --> 01:36:48.880
- He couldn't have jumped and live.

01:36:50.255 --> 01:36:51.552
- Maybe he flew.

01:36:52.632 --> 01:36:56.762
This would be a good place
for Santa to come and get him.

01:37:00.724 --> 01:37:02.271
- The moon is full.

01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:05.438
- And it is Christmas Eve.

01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:09.945
Listen.

01:37:12.486 --> 01:37:14.784
Maybe you'll hear his bells.

01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:31.671
- I hear them.

01:37:33.256 --> 01:37:35.382
I hear them, daddy, I do.

01:37:58.573 --> 01:38:00.115
Goodbye, Prancer.

01:38:00.116 --> 01:38:00.912
Good bye.

01:38:01.868 --> 01:38:02.835
Remember me.
