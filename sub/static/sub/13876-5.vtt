Fore!

00:46.840 --> 00:48.000
ls it loose?

00:48.080 --> 00:50.210
No, not yet.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.250
Better do it again.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.250
All right.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.250
How about now?

00:54.320 --> 00:55.750
No. Still good.

00:57.420 --> 00:58.250
Ah, topped it.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.550
You just hit me in the cheek.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.610
Hold on a minute.
l gotta change clubs.

01:02.090 --> 01:03.020
This is fun.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.360
Check it.

01:06.430 --> 01:07.360
Still in there.

01:07.430 --> 01:09.360
Come on, l hit that one
really solid.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.060
You need to open up your
stance more.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.030
Hold still.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.360
Do not make me slice.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.430
Well, you're flying open on
your follow through.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.900
Lean back on your backswing.

01:16.970 --> 01:18.170
l mean, obviously
you're gonna slice it.

01:19.710 --> 01:20.640
There she is!

01:20.710 --> 01:22.770
Dang, boy, that's my dang
eyeball over there.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.180
So what have we learned
from this?

01:25.250 --> 01:27.680
Do not talk during my backswing.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.680
What are y'all doing?

01:28.750 --> 01:29.910
We're gettin' rich.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.280
What the hell does it look like?

01:31.350 --> 01:34.020
Yeah, we gonna knock out
my last tooth and leave it under

01:34.090 --> 01:36.150
my pillow so when the tooth
fairy comes,

01:36.230 --> 01:39.020
we gonna nab her
and demand all the money.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.930
And then we will invest said
money in a series of CDs

01:43.000 --> 01:45.930
and sensible international bonds
in my name,

01:46.000 --> 01:47.900
possibly some currency
exchanges.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.460
There's still a few things we're
working out on it,

01:49.540 --> 01:51.230
but the basic plan is that.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.940
Assuming an annual rate of
return of,

01:53.010 --> 01:55.100
let's say, 8, 8 1/2%,

01:55.180 --> 01:59.480
<i>we should be able to retire at
60 with a very comfortable...</i>

01:59.550 --> 02:00.480
d-dozen egg--

02:00.550 --> 02:01.480
little nest egg.

02:01.550 --> 02:02.540
l'm so hungry.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.280
Obviously it's a volatile
market.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.290
All right.
Just don't break the lamp.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.259
We got us a lamp?

02:08.330 --> 02:09.759
Shut up!
And say ''cheese!''

02:09.830 --> 02:10.759
Cheese!

02:10.830 --> 02:11.760
Fore!

02:13.630 --> 02:14.790
Jackpot!
Yeah!

02:14.860 --> 02:16.020
Hooray! Ow!

02:17.270 --> 02:18.560
See now l found the sweet spot.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.900
Ow! Wait, l ain't got no --

02:20.970 --> 02:22.460
l ain't no more teeth -- ow!

02:22.540 --> 02:23.470
You cleaned me out!

02:25.380 --> 02:27.940
Okay, is the tooth under
the pillow?

02:28.010 --> 02:29.340
Check.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.040
Affirmative. Copy that.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.050
Roger that.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.710
Now, very important,
are you asleep?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.840
<i>That's a big 10-4,
good buddy. Over.</i>

02:36.920 --> 02:38.180
No you're not. Repeat.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.190
Go to sleep.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.190
l'm sleep-talking.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.920
Well, you need to be sleep
shutting up.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.860
Come on, l need that nest egg.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.950
Okay, l'm going to sleep now,
copy that.

02:48.570 --> 02:51.090
Okay, having trouble going
to sleep.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.500
Counting sheep.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.560
Cannot count.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.830
Tell me a story. Over.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.870
Oh, my go--

02:58.940 --> 03:00.770
Okay, all right.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.410
There once
was a lonely little dart

03:04.480 --> 03:07.180
and all the other darts
made fun of him.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.480
But this dart
was no ordinary dart,

03:10.550 --> 03:14.010
<i>for he was filled with
a mixture of 10cc telazol</i>

03:14.090 --> 03:16.920
and diazepam,
a dangerous tranquilizer

03:16.990 --> 03:19.960
used by equine
veterinarians.

03:20.030 --> 03:21.460
What happened to him?

03:21.530 --> 03:27.130
Well, he huff, and he puffed,
and --

03:27.200 --> 03:28.400
The end.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.170
Tooth Fairy!

03:32.240 --> 03:34.710
Hand over all that change,
bitch--

03:37.250 --> 03:38.180
Dumb ass.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.480
Ain't no tooth fairy.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.980
What do you think
you're doing?

03:41.050 --> 03:42.110
Whoa! Well, l just --

03:42.190 --> 03:44.480
Drop that tooth and back over
to the wall.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.350
Okay, okay, just take the TV,
take the quarter,

03:46.420 --> 03:47.790
take whatever you need --

03:47.860 --> 03:50.290
Fools! l don't want your money!

03:50.360 --> 03:52.160
l have this tooth.

03:52.230 --> 03:53.630
And it's all l need!

03:53.700 --> 03:54.530
Then who are you?

03:54.600 --> 03:58.500
The Creature from
Plaque Lagoon!

04:00.140 --> 04:01.730
Please tell me you floss.

04:01.810 --> 04:02.970
Uh, sometimes.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.530
Liar!

04:06.000 --> 04:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:13.920 --> 04:14.910
Oh, my god!

04:14.980 --> 04:16.250
Oh, my god!

04:16.320 --> 04:17.649
Oh, my god!

04:17.720 --> 04:18.980
Look, l got a quarter.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.519
The Tooth Fairy came!

04:20.589 --> 04:22.420
The silver! lt's mine!

04:22.490 --> 04:25.590
Great, so you can fit us
both in?

04:25.660 --> 04:28.360
No, we do not have dental
insurance,

04:28.430 --> 04:30.700
which in my opinion
is a complete racket!

04:30.770 --> 04:33.260
No offense, but you dentists
make enough money

04:33.340 --> 04:35.200
without having to hustle me
with insurance.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.200
No, no, Shake.

04:36.270 --> 04:37.200
Let me talk to them.

04:37.270 --> 04:38.800
l can handle this, thank you.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.370
No, l do not have a major
credit card.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.440
What l plan to do is to pay by
offering

04:43.510 --> 04:48.580
my services as a gigolo
to your dissatisfied housewife.

04:49.650 --> 04:51.680
Well, that's the last of 'em!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.150
The friggin' dental industry --

04:53.220 --> 04:54.420
Unbelievable!

04:54.490 --> 04:55.750
They're supposed to help people!

04:56.830 --> 04:59.060
''Creature from Plaque Lagoon.''

05:00.300 --> 05:01.660
Dang, look at that.

05:01.730 --> 05:02.990
He got him a website.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.160
Skip flash intro.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.860
That's creeping me out.

05:08.910 --> 05:12.240
Gender is male,
occupation is tooth-stealer.

05:12.310 --> 05:15.800
lnterests include disease,
mouth bacteria,

05:15.880 --> 05:19.010
video games, just hanging out
with friends,

05:19.080 --> 05:24.110
and finally completing a toothship to
return to Tooth Planet.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.280
Finally, tonight
l will have enough dicks

05:27.360 --> 05:31.020
to complete the Dickship and
return to Dick Planet.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.070
- Contact him.
- Hit ''contact.''

05:38.130 --> 05:39.430
That's how you contact him.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.100
l know how the internet
works, okay.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.110
Well, then your training is
complete.

05:44.170 --> 05:47.200
You barely passed,
by the skin of your ass.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.140
Plaque Lagoon is in Vermont?

05:49.210 --> 05:50.770
Nah, man, that's too far.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.780
Skiing in Vermont.

05:51.850 --> 05:52.780
Big ski town.

05:52.850 --> 05:53.780
That's right.

05:53.850 --> 05:57.910
We can stay with Bob Newhart
at his inn, on TV on CBS.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.780
lt be like a vacation, y'all.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.260
l have a slightly better idea.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.320
Well, it better be a whole
lot better.

06:03.390 --> 06:04.880
Because l like Bob Newhart.

06:06.530 --> 06:08.260
As a friend.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.300
For the record,
this is a shit idea.

06:13.370 --> 06:15.270
Look, your gums are so
dissolved,

06:15.340 --> 06:16.310
they're gonna fall
out anyway.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.310
When is Bob Newhart gonna
get here?

06:18.370 --> 06:19.310
Yeah, where is Bobby?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.310
Shut up. l hear something.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.540
Bobby is what l call Bob Newhart

06:22.610 --> 06:24.170
when he calls me on
the phone.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.310
Be quiet.

06:25.380 --> 06:26.610
l speak with Bobby pretty
regularly.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.120
We got so much in common.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.850
First off,
we share the same agent.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.750
Shh.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.810
<i>Yeah, you know that show
Newhart?</i>

06:32.890 --> 06:35.220
<i>Originally, it was supposed to
be called Milkshake.</i>

06:35.290 --> 06:36.220
But they couldn't get me.

06:36.290 --> 06:37.520
Shake, shut up.

06:37.590 --> 06:40.620
<i>See, l was over at Paramount
gripping on Days of Thunder.</i>

06:40.700 --> 06:43.100
'Cept for me, it was just
''Day of Thunder,''

06:43.170 --> 06:45.330
'cause l got fired that
afternoon.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.230
Who is Bob Newhart?

06:46.300 --> 06:47.430
Shut the fuck up!

06:50.010 --> 06:52.070
l got you,
you son of a bitch!

06:52.140 --> 06:53.610
What the -- who are you?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.300
lt's the Tooth Fairy, y'all!

06:55.380 --> 06:58.540
No, l'm Gary,
Gary the Dairy Fairy.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.610
Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah.

07:00.680 --> 07:04.480
See, l leave glasses of warm milk
and cheese and yogurts,

07:04.550 --> 07:07.250
to help build
strong bones and teeth.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.290
l'm more of a preventative,
like dietary fairy.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.650
Ah, nobody cares.

07:13.730 --> 07:14.660
Oh, no, no no.

07:14.730 --> 07:15.660
We were listening.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.930
That was beau--
Do you have any money?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.660
Give us your money.

07:18.740 --> 07:19.600
Oh, well, here's some coins.

07:19.670 --> 07:20.530
Doubloons!

07:20.600 --> 07:22.970
Of beautiful patinaed silver!

07:23.040 --> 07:24.200
Made of cheese.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.640
They're designed to get kids
excited about calcium,

07:26.710 --> 07:28.800
but all kids care about are
video games

07:28.880 --> 07:31.870
where you steal cars and have
sex with Russian prostitutes.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.210
Hey, where is that stuff
happening?

07:33.280 --> 07:34.610
l have an idea for a video game

07:34.680 --> 07:37.620
where you floss twice daily
to fight off gum depletion.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.160
ln fact, it's not a game at all.

07:40.220 --> 07:42.190
lt's called flossing!

07:42.260 --> 07:44.750
Okay, well, it was really
great to meet you.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.420
And, uh, l will catch up with
you later.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.120
Oh, no.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.060
The Creature from Plaque Lagoon.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.190
He's been here, hasn't he?

07:52.270 --> 07:53.200
That's the one.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.200
That son of a bitch.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.200
Do you know him?

07:55.270 --> 07:57.140
l wish that l could say no.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.300
He is a close personal friend
of mine.

08:00.380 --> 08:05.910
But we have one issue
where we completely disagree.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.910
lmmigration.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.080
Dental hygiene.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.520
Follow me to Plaque Lagoon.

08:12.820 --> 08:13.750
ls this Vermont?

08:13.820 --> 08:15.220
This is a Better Buy!

08:15.290 --> 08:18.590
Well, this is where
Plaque Lagoon used to be.

08:18.660 --> 08:20.690
Well, it isn't now!

08:20.760 --> 08:24.490
Oh! That's right!
He moved! l forgot!

08:25.000 --> 08:27.800
Well, you guys wanna go in and
see what's new on Blu-ray?

08:27.870 --> 08:30.130
Yeah, look okay, maybe you
oughta go buy a damn GPS

08:30.210 --> 08:32.230
so you can find out where your
goddamned friends live, okay?

08:32.309 --> 08:34.330
Well, he's not so much
a friend.

08:34.409 --> 08:36.710
l mean, if l see him l say hey,

08:36.780 --> 08:38.870
but it's not like we hang out
or anything.

08:38.950 --> 08:40.880
l mean, it's not like l hate him.

08:40.950 --> 08:44.179
We just differ on one really
important issue.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.580
Okay, okay. We get it.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.210
He's a casual acquaintance.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.050
Well, he's more than casual.

08:49.130 --> 08:51.060
l mean, l've known him for
a while.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.060
But it's not like l'm in love
with him, or you know,

08:54.130 --> 08:56.430
Look! lt's the Creature
from the Plaque Lagoon!

09:00.240 --> 09:01.360
Oh, hey. What are --

09:01.440 --> 09:02.840
What are you doing here?
Are you following me?

09:02.910 --> 09:03.840
How's it going, man?

09:03.910 --> 09:05.270
You don't look like much
of a creature.

09:05.340 --> 09:07.210
He is, believe me.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.210
Do you know how much those
braces cost me?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.210
l don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.210
Well, does this refresh your
memory?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.450
And that's just a small taste
of my anger.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.450
Look, stop accusing --

09:17.520 --> 09:18.450
l don't know you.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.950
l will also do that to your
groin

09:20.020 --> 09:22.790
and then your face if you
do not comply.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.790
Uh, Shake, l don't think
this is the guy.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.800
No, no, l am the Creature from
Plaque Lagoon, okay?

09:28.870 --> 09:31.200
But someone stole my identity
and has made a lot of dental-

09:31.270 --> 09:34.630
related purchases
with my fucking credit card.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.230
Just 'cause that's my name,

09:36.310 --> 09:38.770
doesn't meant that l'm into
that.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.540
There, l've answered your
question, now you help me.

09:41.610 --> 09:42.540
Open the van.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.310
<i>6498.</i>

09:45.380 --> 09:47.280
<i>Expires 1 1/09.</i>

09:47.350 --> 09:49.410
Yes, l am he.

09:49.490 --> 09:52.010
The Creature
from Plaque Lagoon, yes.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.220
Overnight ship the molar engine
at once,

09:54.290 --> 09:55.950
so that l may complete
the toothship

09:56.030 --> 10:00.290
and return to my
enameled condo on Tooth Planet.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.300
Wongburger!

10:01.360 --> 10:02.490
Dr. Wongburger?

10:02.570 --> 10:03.760
But didn't you use to be --

10:03.830 --> 10:05.100
A dick?

10:05.170 --> 10:06.600
With balls of rage?

10:06.670 --> 10:07.600
Yeah, that.

10:07.670 --> 10:08.600
Yes!

10:08.670 --> 10:11.400
For years, that's how people
saw me.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.470
But l was actually a tooth
trapped inside the shaft

10:13.540 --> 10:16.170
of a dick, crying to get out.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.740
lt was a private shame.

10:18.820 --> 10:23.280
Through years of painful surgery
at great expense,

10:23.350 --> 10:25.010
l was able to change myself and

10:25.090 --> 10:27.750
become what God intended
for me to be.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.790
Chatterman!

10:33.600 --> 10:35.090
You're a madman, Wongburger!

10:35.160 --> 10:37.060
Hey, l know that.

10:37.130 --> 10:40.360
So, you think l could, uh,
get my tooth back?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.370
Yes, of course.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.370
Which one is yours?

10:42.440 --> 10:43.560
- This is.
- No, no Meatwad!

10:46.810 --> 10:48.780
Applesauce is good.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.440
And that's why
l'm gonna have me

10:50.510 --> 10:53.350
one more container of applesauce.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.380
Don't load up on applesauce.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.380
lt's a fruit!

10:55.450 --> 10:56.380
You need some mashed carrots.

10:56.450 --> 10:57.380
You too, Shake.

10:57.450 --> 10:58.390
l don't like carrots.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.940
We got some butternut squash
over here.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.460
F- that baby goop, 'cause

11:01.520 --> 11:06.590
the Master shall imbibe the wing
of the buffalo tonight.

11:06.660 --> 11:07.590
lmbibe?

11:07.660 --> 11:08.860
How the hell you gonna do that?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.370
What's that?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.370
You should take the bones out
before you do that, Shake.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.630
l'm sorry, l didn't hear you.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.830
l'm making a man's meal.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.270
Did you get mild or hot?

11:30.350 --> 11:31.980
My gums!

11:33.020 --> 11:34.490
- l guess it's hot.
- l think he went with the hot.
