AUDREY ON PHONE: Ike?

55:04.106 --> 55:05.172
Ike?

55:07.977 --> 55:09.410
Ike, is that you?

55:10.346 --> 55:12.146
It's your little sister, Audrey.

55:15.184 --> 55:16.283
Umm...

55:17.420 --> 55:19.264
I thought you stopped calling.

55:19.288 --> 55:21.899
AUDREY: Oh, no.

55:21.923 --> 55:24.535
Ike, you're right.
I missed a couple of calls.

55:24.559 --> 55:27.038
- Sorry.
- IKE: Is everything okay?

55:27.062 --> 55:28.594
I've been thinking about the kids.

55:30.698 --> 55:32.065
AUDREY: Everything's fine.

55:38.538 --> 55:40.605
I... I had a bad day.

55:42.509 --> 55:43.641
IKE: Why?

55:44.578 --> 55:45.643
Stuff.

55:46.546 --> 55:47.980
Tell me a joke.

55:50.650 --> 55:52.584
IKE: What do you call a magic dog?

55:53.587 --> 55:55.294
I don't... I don't know. What?

55:56.722 --> 55:58.300
IKE: A labra-cadabra.

55:58.324 --> 55:59.923
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

56:01.227 --> 56:02.693
IKE: You're lying.

56:03.796 --> 56:05.863
Everything is not fine.

56:08.173 --> 56:16.186
