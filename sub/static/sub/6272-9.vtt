Bill always knows what's best for him.

I now have you

when I brought him in.

20:33.591 --> 20:35.892
ESTABROOKS:
The crash breaks their necks.

20:35.927 --> 20:39.129
Sounds awful, but it's
the quickest way to go.

20:39.163 --> 20:40.797
Come on. Let's put him
in the outside trash.

20:40.832 --> 20:42.999

the bird is my fault,

20:43.034 --> 20:45.302
and I will take care of it.

ESTABROOKS: Your fault?
I don't understand.

you've ever done, Essie?

20:56.848 --> 20:58.081
ESTABROOKS: Oh, heavens.

20:58.115 --> 20:59.983
Where did that question come from?

21:00.017 --> 21:03.153
LIBBY: I want to know.
I won't tell Bill.

21:03.187 --> 21:06.022
I've done something wrong.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.491
ESTABROOKS: Oh, honey,
we all do something we regret.

21:08.526 --> 21:10.927
LIBBY: No, I mean recently,
and the thing I did...

21:15.433 --> 21:20.003
Well, I just might have died...
inside, I mean...

21:20.037 --> 21:22.072
[ Sighs ] If I hadn't done it.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.874
And even if it's a bad thing,

21:23.908 --> 21:27.010
that's the right reason
to do something, isn't it?

21:29.146 --> 21:33.116
ESTABROOKS:
You mean to...save yourself?

21:33.150 --> 21:36.519
Well, my mother did always say

21:36.554 --> 21:38.655
you have to be
your own best friend.

21:41.559 --> 21:44.694
LIBBY: Did you know that my
mother died when I was a girl?

21:44.729 --> 21:47.297
ESTABROOKS: I did.
It's a terrible loss.

21:47.331 --> 21:50.267
LIBBY: Then you don't know
the strange part is that,

21:50.301 --> 21:55.772
a few days after the funeral,
my father disappeared.

21:55.806 --> 21:59.643
ESTABROOKS: Bill told me
your father had passed on.

21:59.677 --> 22:02.746
LIBBY:
Because that's what I tell people.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.149
But the truth is...

22:06.183 --> 22:11.221
one day he just...
didn't come home.

22:11.255 --> 22:13.156
And my sisters and I were terrified,

22:13.190 --> 22:15.125
sure that something terrible
had happened to him.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.161
It took a few days,

22:18.195 --> 22:23.099
but...a neighbor
tracked him down.

22:23.134 --> 22:28.004
He had moved...to Virginia.

22:28.039 --> 22:29.372
ESTABROOKS: Oh.

22:29.407 --> 22:33.810
LIBBY: After that,
all I wanted was to grow up...

22:33.844 --> 22:36.546
So that I could have a family.

22:40.451 --> 22:43.153
So that I could have a happy ending.

I think your happy ending is now.

below the collarbone.

23:39.276 --> 23:41.077
LESTER: And cut.

23:41.112 --> 23:44.414
WILLIAM: I noted at least five
myotonic responses.

23:44.448 --> 23:47.317
LESTER: I was going for a kind
of Edward Steichen approach...

23:47.351 --> 23:49.486
the body as landscape.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.087

I timed the carpopedal spasming

23:51.122 --> 23:52.555
late in the excitement phase...
You?

23:52.590 --> 23:55.892
WILLIAM: I saw it most acutely
in early plateau.

23:55.926 --> 23:57.794
LESTER:
The undulation of stomach muscles

23:57.828 --> 23:58.995
like ripples on a lake,

23:59.030 --> 24:00.764
the spiking of fingers
like stalagmites...

24:03.100 --> 24:05.435

stand with the auteur theory, but...

24:05.469 --> 24:06.936

Lester, we'd like to see

24:06.971 --> 24:08.605
what we have here
as soon as possible.

When can you
have this developed?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

You develop all our film.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.813
LESTER: The other films were...
indoor locations.

24:16.847 --> 24:19.616
I told the boys down at the lab
it was a laryngoscopy.

24:19.650 --> 24:22.485
Turns out a voice box and a,
you know, look really similar.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.686
But tonight's film?

It's not pornography.

the first people

that footage developed?

Sometimes people grab
at their partners during sex.

25:52.042 --> 25:53.309
ESTABROOKS: Mm-hmm.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.713

novel will tell you

25:56.747 --> 26:00.316
that that is an expression
of passion or intimacy,

26:00.351 --> 26:02.752
but what Bill and I are finding

26:02.786 --> 26:05.955
is that it's actually something
that you can't control.

26:05.990 --> 26:09.592
It's not desire.
It's an involuntary spasm.

we've been exploring tonight.

you like black olives, Billy?

is a better word for it.

I've learned how to spot them
from a mile away.

in my performance review, Bill.

WILLIAM: I know my wife.

41:47.764 --> 41:50.032
My wife would never...

41:50.066 --> 41:54.002
LIBBY: Just like my husband
would never lie to me.

41:56.573 --> 42:00.509
We have to forgive each other...
and move forward.

42:00.543 --> 42:02.845
WILLIAM: You'll forgive me
if I... I don't see it that way.

42:02.879 --> 42:04.746
Excuse me.

42:04.781 --> 42:07.149
LIBBY:
You're not going anywhere, Bill.

42:07.183 --> 42:10.719
You are in that exam room
night after night,

42:10.753 --> 42:12.754
watching people have sex.

42:12.789 --> 42:15.591
Human sexual response,
you call it.

42:15.625 --> 42:17.960
But there is no humanity in it.

42:17.994 --> 42:21.230
It is...important work,

42:21.264 --> 42:23.532
but it's not life.

42:23.566 --> 42:28.103
It's physiology.
It's... It's numbers.

42:28.138 --> 42:31.173
Nothing that truly matters
in this world

42:31.207 --> 42:33.175
can be measured like that.

42:33.209 --> 42:36.378
The purpose of sex isn't an orgasm.

42:36.412 --> 42:38.046
It is making life.

42:38.081 --> 42:41.416
This is life.

42:41.451 --> 42:44.520
This is love.

42:44.554 --> 42:48.857
Without it...

42:48.892 --> 42:53.495
you're just a man, lost in space,

42:53.530 --> 42:57.566

hoping to hear something back.

43:01.571 --> 43:04.473
What I am...

43:04.507 --> 43:09.111
what this baby is...

43:09.145 --> 43:12.915
what a family is...

43:12.949 --> 43:16.118
we're your echo.

43:25.895 --> 43:28.630
ETHAN:
Uh, I'm going to pass on the bacon.

43:28.665 --> 43:30.999
VIVIAN: Why? You love bacon.

43:31.034 --> 43:35.504
ETHAN:
I like it, but...I don't know.

43:35.538 --> 43:37.639
I'm gonna try something different.

43:37.674 --> 43:38.941
VIVIAN: Ham?

43:41.778 --> 43:43.779
ETHAN: I was just thinking
about my dad this morning.

43:43.813 --> 43:45.914
He's never tasted bacon.

43:45.949 --> 43:49.985
He was raised that way
by my grandparents.

43:50.019 --> 43:53.088
He tried to raise us kids
that way, too.

43:53.122 --> 43:54.590
I thought it was stupid,

43:54.624 --> 43:57.092
and as soon as I could,

43:57.126 --> 44:01.363
I ignored it
and ate whatever I wanted.

44:01.397 --> 44:04.900
But it meant something to my dad.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.935
And my dad means something to me.

44:06.970 --> 44:10.305
VIVIAN: Everybody cares
about their parents.

44:10.340 --> 44:12.341
ETHAN: But I never asked him.

44:12.375 --> 44:16.445
"Why no bacon?"
"Why get circumcised?"

44:16.479 --> 44:20.983
Why is some little wafer
supposed to be the body of Christ?

44:21.017 --> 44:23.418
VIVIAN:
Your father believes in Christ?

44:23.453 --> 44:24.953
ETHAN: No.

44:24.988 --> 44:26.221
My point is that I...

44:26.256 --> 44:29.458
VIVIAN: You're nervous
about converting.

44:29.492 --> 44:30.626
ETHAN: [ Clears throat ]

44:30.660 --> 44:32.728
I wouldn't say nervous...

44:32.762 --> 44:35.197
Because I'm not going
to convert.

44:40.903 --> 44:43.305
I understand
what this means for you.

44:43.339 --> 44:46.775
I know you can't marry a jew.

44:46.809 --> 44:49.244
VIVIAN: Why... Why not?

44:49.279 --> 44:53.359
Because I...
Girls like me don't do that?

44:53.394 --> 44:54.383
Because my parents won't understand?

44:54.417 --> 44:57.819
I don't need to do whatever
everybody expects me to do.

44:57.854 --> 45:00.055
ETHAN: But a church wedding
matters to you.

45:00.089 --> 45:02.024
And you're a girl
that deserves that.

45:02.058 --> 45:04.826
VIVIAN: You matter to me.

45:04.861 --> 45:07.329
If we have to get married
in a courthouse,

45:07.363 --> 45:08.864
then that's what we'll do.

45:08.898 --> 45:10.365
ETHAN: And how would we
raise our children?

45:10.400 --> 45:14.136
VIVIAN: The way that we decide
to raise them... Together.

45:14.170 --> 45:20.442
Ethan, why are you suddenly acting
like you care about all of this stuff?

45:20.476 --> 45:22.978
ETHAN: Because I should care
about something.

45:23.012 --> 45:24.913
You know, sh-shouldn't I stand up

45:24.947 --> 45:26.982
and declare myself about something?

45:27.016 --> 45:29.951
VIVIAN: You're about to stand up
in front of everyone we know,

45:29.986 --> 45:34.956
in front of everyone that we love,
and declare yourself to me.

45:34.991 --> 45:36.692
You picked me.

ETHAN: No.

45:39.228 --> 45:41.263
Viv, you picked me.

VIVIAN: What are you saying?

if I could go back to when I was 20...

45:51.708 --> 45:54.676
and design what I thought
was the perfect girl for me,

45:54.711 --> 45:56.178

I have to explain what's the matter?

46:38.588 --> 46:40.222
VIRGINIA: Oh,
that's excellent footage, Jane.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.523
In the first minute alone,

46:41.557 --> 46:43.725
we've captured neck strain,
vasocongestion,

46:43.760 --> 46:46.261
the start of a very promising
stomach-muscle spasm.

46:46.295 --> 46:48.930
JANE: My stomach muscles,
my neck.

46:48.965 --> 46:51.533
- VIRGINIA: You can't tell it's you.
- JANE: But that's the problem.

46:51.567 --> 46:54.870
I know that it's me, but I don't
know who that girl is,

I-I don't want to know.

47:00.977 --> 47:03.678
JANE: Virginia...

47:03.713 --> 47:08.316
I've not exactly been a saint,
as you know.

47:08.351 --> 47:10.986
I've slept with a few men,

47:11.020 --> 47:14.055
and...well, I like it.

47:14.090 --> 47:17.993
I like the feeling of a man,
the weight of his body,

47:18.027 --> 47:21.229
feeling like I don't exist

47:21.264 --> 47:24.032
except as a million tiny
nerve endings.

47:24.066 --> 47:28.570
And it can also feel
pretty great when I'm alone.

47:28.604 --> 47:33.542
But it's an...
it's an inside feeling.

47:33.576 --> 47:36.077
That's how I know sex.

47:36.112 --> 47:38.680
That...

47:38.714 --> 47:39.915
I don't want to see that,

to see it, either.

in the work that I've done here.

I do.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.427
And I hope that you don't give me
a bad performance review because of this,

47:52.462 --> 47:54.162
but...

47:54.697 --> 47:56.631
I can't have this film out there.

47:56.665 --> 47:58.433
I'm sorry.

VIRGINIA: Jane.
She won't do any more filming.

48:15.918 --> 48:19.754
In fact, she asked us to destroy
the latest film.

48:19.788 --> 48:21.022
I've already done it.

48:21.056 --> 48:24.225

but we owe her this much.

This was... I don't know.

48:27.796 --> 48:30.231
For some reason, it was
just too much for her.

WILLIAM: We paid her.

48:32.334 --> 48:35.036
VIRGINIA: Well, I think
that's part of the problem.

48:35.070 --> 48:37.071
Getting paid to show
her naked body?

48:37.106 --> 48:40.375
To her mind, only hookers
and porn actors do that.

- She gave the money back.
- WILLIAM: I see.

that Mrs. Johnson possesses

to take her work so personally
