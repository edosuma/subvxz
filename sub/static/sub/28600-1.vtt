00:25.193 --> 00:28.696
This story was inspired
by true events that took place

00:28.780 --> 00:33.742
in the Guajira region (northern Colombia),
between the decades of 1960 and 1980.

01:15.575 --> 01:20.330
...the family,
the grandmother, the mother...

01:21.708 --> 01:25.253
...the uncle, the nephew, the grandson...

01:26.170 --> 01:28.506
are represented in the hand's fingers,

01:28.548 --> 01:32.427
so that the Wayuu won't forget his origin.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.846
If there's family,

01:36.431 --> 01:37.890
there's respect.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.809
If there's respect,

01:40.018 --> 01:41.561
there's honor.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.229
If there's honor,

01:43.438 --> 01:44.772
there's word.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.316
If there's word,

01:46.691 --> 01:48.693
there's peace.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.653
Look at me, Zaida.

01:54.699 --> 01:58.536
You have fulfilled your year
in confinement with dignity and grace.

01:59.578 --> 02:03.833
When you go out, you'll be a woman.
You must be aware of the signs.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.336
Use them to protect your family.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.464
Come here, Zaida.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.387
The core of the family...

02:18.765 --> 02:20.475
The grandmother...

02:21.392 --> 02:23.144
The mother...

02:23.769 --> 02:25.396
The nephew...

02:25.939 --> 02:27.482
The uncle...

02:37.075 --> 02:41.411
I am the shepherd,
the shepherd who sings jayeechis.

02:41.536 --> 02:45.207
I've sung to bid farewell to the dead
and to remember the wars of the past.

02:45.374 --> 02:49.211
To bring the winds
and recount stories of love.

02:49.379 --> 02:52.006
My memory has started to fade and with it,

02:52.089 --> 02:54.884
all the tales and stories that I've sung.

02:55.093 --> 02:59.429
Before my footprints are erased,
with my singing I want to remember

02:59.931 --> 03:02.475
the story of love,
desolation, wealth and pain

03:02.600 --> 03:05.853
of that great family
that destroyed itself.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.731
It is first the story of Rapayet,
who came from a lineage of warriors.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.235
He lost everyone when he was a boy
and grew among foreigners

03:13.403 --> 03:17.197
in this place where family
means everything.

03:43.808 --> 03:47.269
Don't cry. Don't be afraid.

03:48.730 --> 03:51.232
I'll be by your side.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.655
Let's go.

04:13.630 --> 04:16.173
I thought you weren't coming, uncle.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.426
What did you bring?

04:19.010 --> 04:20.928
A tuma necklace.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.608
Come out, daughter.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.814
I present you with my work.

05:28.329 --> 05:32.417
Let's have a great feast now that my niece
Zaida has become a woman!

06:38.899 --> 06:41.109
I want to dance the Yonna with you, too.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.808
Who is he?

07:11.890 --> 07:14.434
Rapayet, Peregrino's nephew.

07:14.894 --> 07:16.144
Uliana?

07:17.063 --> 07:18.481
Abuchaibe Uliana.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.308
You are my woman.

08:10.116 --> 08:13.620
Rapayet, you should've brought a goat.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.955
Necklaces aren't appropriate.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.919
If they accept you,
you'll have to work hard.

08:21.169 --> 08:23.630
I got new customers for you.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.424
The dowry is going to be expensive.

08:27.592 --> 08:29.176
I'll get it, uncle.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.058
Be honest when you speak to her mother.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.812
Don't hide the situation you're in.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.649
She's the one you have to persuade.

08:44.442 --> 08:49.614
You have to convince her
that you'll put your family above all.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.659
Even above your businesses
with alijunas, nephew.

08:54.744 --> 08:59.499
Your deeds
will have to back up your words.

09:31.197 --> 09:34.616
She was barefooted, she had a blanket.

09:36.535 --> 09:40.164
Did she see you? Did you see her face?

09:43.042 --> 09:45.920
I can't remember,
but she spoke to me in Spanish.

09:48.798 --> 09:52.051
Your grandmother is showing us the way.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.511
It's a dead end, straight into the sea.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.266
It's calm now, but it can be turbulent.

10:04.981 --> 10:09.068
Someone needs our help,
but they can also bring us pain.

10:15.158 --> 10:17.409
I don't want to dream anymore.

10:18.244 --> 10:22.290
Dreams prove the existence of the soul.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.002
Don't be scared.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.759
Death comes and goes.
We have to be alert.

10:34.135 --> 10:36.471
You've always known
how to talk to the dream.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.805
You did good in ending the confinement.

10:39.432 --> 10:41.893
We must listen
to what your grandmother is telling us.

10:41.976 --> 10:44.938
Let's hope death won't show up again.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.584
If you want to have a family,
you'll have to follow our traditions.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.504
I know.

11:10.630 --> 11:13.591
Necklaces are very personal items,
they're used as protection,

11:13.674 --> 11:15.550
and are given in a different occasion.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.095
You should've brought a goat.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.563
Friends.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.150
Have you eaten and slept well?

11:32.526 --> 11:36.488
As always. It's a celebration
worthy of the Pushaina family.

11:45.914 --> 11:50.377
Last time I came,
you had half the animals.

11:51.918 --> 11:53.380
We've had a lot of rain.

11:54.090 --> 11:56.968
My ranch has been blessed by Juyá.

11:57.385 --> 12:03.099
You've also known
how to handle business with alijunas.

12:03.433 --> 12:07.269
Úrsula is known for her trading skills
around the province.

12:09.856 --> 12:14.693
Today, I come as word messenger
to my nephew, Rapayet Abuchaibe Uliana.

12:17.697 --> 12:21.200
He's the son
of my deceased cousin, Chay Uliana.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.995
Rapayet wants to marry Zaida.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.499
He's a suitor you should consider.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.629
Peregrino, you're one of the most
respected word messengers there are.

12:32.712 --> 12:34.797
We'll listen to you, but my sister Úrsula

12:34.880 --> 12:38.384
is one of the most prestigious
Wayuus in the Wajira.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.137
Her daughter deserves
a better family than Rapayet's.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.683
His family had great prestige once.

12:45.850 --> 12:49.687
Most of them died in a dispute,
but that conflict was resolved with honor.

12:49.938 --> 12:53.691
Rapayet not only forged
a path for himself without help,

12:53.899 --> 12:56.903
but he established a relationship
with the alijunas,

12:56.986 --> 12:58.862
that opened the world to him.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.322
He's a great businessman,

13:00.365 --> 13:02.909
and his respect for traditions
is an example to be followed.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.077
He'll make your family's prestige grow.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.002
Do you speak Spanish, Rapayet?

13:14.712 --> 13:16.630
Yes, but I prefer to speak wayuunaiki.

13:24.138 --> 13:31.771
For the dowry, we are requesting
30 goats, 20 cows, five necklaces,

13:33.814 --> 13:36.275
two of them made
from mountain tuma stones

13:36.359 --> 13:37.860
and two decorative mules.

13:38.528 --> 13:41.197
That's the dowry
if you want to marry Zaida.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.919
Do you know why I'm respected?

13:57.922 --> 14:01.759
Because you know how to treat alijunas.
And you can talk to the dreams.

14:02.510 --> 14:03.468
No.

14:03.720 --> 14:08.182
Because I'm capable of anything
for my family and my clan.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.065
This is our family's talisman.

14:17.609 --> 14:20.570
I guard it.

14:21.529 --> 14:26.159
From plagues and people trying to fool us.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.661
Even if you get the dowry,
the spirits will warn me about you.

14:40.255 --> 14:46.553
BIRDS OF PASSAGE

14:58.649 --> 15:04.905
SONG I
WILD GRASS

16:17.269 --> 16:19.480
- Have you been waiting long?
- A while.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.315
Are you Peregrino's nephew?

16:22.399 --> 16:23.067
Yes.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.736
Did you bring all the merchandise?

16:31.074 --> 16:32.492
One, two, three...

16:44.255 --> 16:47.383
Are you going somewhere?

16:52.721 --> 16:54.390
My ride is here.

16:55.308 --> 16:57.434
Give my regards to your uncle.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.645
Gladly.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.808
Count it, Moncho.

17:44.357 --> 17:45.858
We'll lose all our costumers that way.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.652
To women, my friend.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.154
The most beautiful thing.

17:51.906 --> 17:53.908
We have an early start, Moncho.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.996
We need to go get the coffee, tomorrow.

18:14.012 --> 18:15.013
Hi, César.

18:15.138 --> 18:16.472
How's it going, Rafa?

18:17.348 --> 18:18.515
All good.

19:12.027 --> 19:15.322
Those Americans over there
are from something called the Peace Corps.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.034
They say they're rallying
against Communism,

19:18.325 --> 19:20.870
but what they're desperately trying
to find is marijuana.

19:22.788 --> 19:23.956
Do you have any to sell them?

19:25.123 --> 19:26.041
No.

19:43.351 --> 19:44.893
Moncho, I have no more money.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.520
Take it easy.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.856
It's on me. We made some money
today.

19:54.570 --> 19:55.571
Hi, César.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.366
Two packs of cigarettes, please.

20:04.205 --> 20:05.915
- Twenty pesos.
- Like this?

20:06.957 --> 20:08.834
Have you found what I'm looking
for?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.169
No.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.215
Hey!

20:23.474 --> 20:24.225
César.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.727
When are the gringos leaving?

20:26.852 --> 20:27.853
I don't know.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.443
We can get them the marijuana
they're looking for, Moncho.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.818
Is that so?

20:35.111 --> 20:36.696
Where are you hiding it?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.822
Underneath that little skirt
you wear?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.493
Introduce me, César.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.084
Hi, Peter. I think I found
what you’re looking for.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.591
Bill is going to be happy with
this.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.550
Thank you.

20:58.676 --> 21:00.553
- See you soon.
- Ok, Peter.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.391
Remember, say no to Communism.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.895
No Communism, Peter.

21:10.021 --> 21:12.774
Long live Capitalism!

21:17.611 --> 21:18.862
Are you crazy?

21:19.572 --> 21:21.823
Where will we find 50 kilos?

21:22.533 --> 21:24.118
Two hundred pesos a pound.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.411
We couldn't have done the deal
for less.

21:26.912 --> 21:28.288
How are we gonna pay?

21:31.876 --> 21:33.795
We're gonna reinvest
the money from the coffee.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.381
Long live Capitalism, my friend.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.102
- Straight ahead?
- Yes.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.420
It's all I have.

22:24.012 --> 22:25.554
He wants to be paid more.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.727
Tell him we'll pay him when we
get back.

22:33.563 --> 22:35.314
We'll pay you when we come back.

22:35.398 --> 22:36.815
In his language.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.651
Do you think we speak the same
language?

22:47.909 --> 22:50.537
This is worth more
than your donkey ride.

23:13.602 --> 23:14.562
Calm down!

23:33.581 --> 23:34.582
Who are you?

23:40.338 --> 23:41.214
Gabriel.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.173
Take it easy, cousin.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.260
Rapayet.

23:48.137 --> 23:49.013
Rapayet?

23:50.139 --> 23:51.349
Cousin Rapayet.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.226
Long time, no see!

23:54.060 --> 23:54.977
Come in.

24:40.898 --> 24:44.319
I thought the Sierra was not
a place worthy of a Wayuu.

24:47.447 --> 24:49.489
This is my friend Moisés.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.909
We brought you a goat.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.873
Why are you still speaking indian?
We're not in the desert.

25:04.296 --> 25:05.297
Mérida.

25:06.090 --> 25:07.717
Offer them something to drink.

25:20.438 --> 25:22.814
How much for a pound of coffee?

25:23.274 --> 25:24.274
Twelve?

25:24.942 --> 25:26.944
I'll give you 50 for the weed.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.072
It's a great business, cousin.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.074
It'll be good for both families.

25:36.370 --> 25:37.996
Give me 60.

25:45.088 --> 25:47.173
I don't do business with
alijunas.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.099
You're negotiating with me,
cousin.

25:56.724 --> 25:58.351
Help me get the dowry.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.297
But Aníbal, how much ointment
are you going to make?

26:33.844 --> 26:35.596
Your cousins are a riot.

26:54.573 --> 26:55.490
Victoria.

26:56.284 --> 26:57.200
Rapayet.

27:06.002 --> 27:08.046
My contribution, for the dowry.

27:17.388 --> 27:18.555
Thank you, cousin.

27:33.612 --> 27:34.822
See you, partner.

28:03.642 --> 28:05.852
I didn't think they would get
it.

28:07.063 --> 28:08.147
Yes, mister.

28:08.814 --> 28:09.815
Here we are.

28:10.524 --> 28:11.734
We bring you joy.

28:14.445 --> 28:15.655
Did you get the money?

28:16.406 --> 28:17.447
Of course.

28:17.782 --> 28:18.908
Do you want to take a look?

28:50.564 --> 28:51.690
I'll go get the money.

29:39.030 --> 29:40.114
Look at them, Rafa.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.368
This is a fantastic business.

29:44.953 --> 29:46.955
Weed is the world's happiness.

29:47.913 --> 29:49.581
Their happiness.

30:01.052 --> 30:02.219
Hey. What's up?

30:02.678 --> 30:03.595
My name is Bill.

30:04.179 --> 30:07.140
We work in the exports business.

30:07.557 --> 30:10.185
I am very interested
in this product of yours.

30:10.395 --> 30:12.313
Can we talk about it?
May I sit down?

30:12.522 --> 30:13.523
Of course.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.546
What are you doing, Rapayet?

31:21.674 --> 31:23.217
I brought the dowry.

31:24.593 --> 31:26.763
Did you bring the necklaces?

31:35.103 --> 31:38.815
Where did you get all this?

31:39.566 --> 31:42.402
I'm in business with the
gringos.

31:45.531 --> 31:48.868
Being among alijunas has made
you forget about our traditions.

31:50.578 --> 31:53.498
You have to send word
before delivering the dowry.

31:53.747 --> 31:56.458
Go get Peregrino.

31:57.293 --> 31:59.544
Or you will unleash the
spirits' fury.

32:35.163 --> 32:40.127
Wayúu, you are now sharing a hammock.
Your path is joyful and simple.

32:41.918 --> 32:46.342
Úrsula has taken you into her family,
you are with the Pushainas now.

32:47.302 --> 32:50.804
You'll have to prove yourself.

32:52.556 --> 32:58.187
You'll learn it's not hard having a
family or making it grow.

32:59.730 --> 33:05.986
You'll learn that what's hard,
is keeping it together.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.517
What's going on?

34:26.567 --> 34:28.444
Does my brother's wife like
vallenato music?

34:31.822 --> 34:33.658
What's the name of my godson?

34:34.616 --> 34:37.077
Miguel Dionisio Pushaina
Abuchaibe.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.248
Just so you won't say
I don't respect your traditions,

34:42.958 --> 34:44.585
I brought a gift.

34:46.379 --> 34:47.297
What is it?

34:55.596 --> 34:57.473
We're too big for goats now,
Rafa.

34:59.641 --> 35:01.060
It's yours, my friend!

35:02.603 --> 35:04.813
This car costs more than a
shipping!

35:05.897 --> 35:08.650
That's why we have
to make them bigger now.

35:09.986 --> 35:11.529
That's what money is for,

35:11.612 --> 35:12.821
to spend it!

35:52.444 --> 35:56.448
SONG II
THE GRAVES

36:43.288 --> 36:44.330
Leonidas.

36:51.504 --> 36:54.966
You can't drink liquor.
You must get ready.

36:55.632 --> 36:59.636
Now that your uncle Ministro is dead,
it's your right to be head of the family.

37:01.346 --> 37:02.265
Behave.

37:14.902 --> 37:18.406
If he's a boy, we could name him
Peregrino, like you.

37:18.906 --> 37:21.534
Us Peregrinos, we are restless.

37:21.783 --> 37:27.539
This family needs a stronger name,
worthy of an heir.

37:29.250 --> 37:31.502
Peregrino is a nice name.

37:33.837 --> 37:37.883
But it will be a girl, and she must
have a prosperous and luminous name.

37:42.596 --> 37:44.098
There's a plague coming.

37:44.848 --> 37:47.768
You've become
too superstitious, mother.

37:56.402 --> 37:58.905
These alijunas
have no respect for anything.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.714
I've been looking everywhere for
you. Where were you?

38:20.509 --> 38:22.178
Turn down the music, Moncho.

38:22.261 --> 38:23.763
This is not a party.

38:26.015 --> 38:27.016
Really?

38:29.393 --> 38:32.187
If this is not a party, I wouldn't
want to miss a real one.

38:32.813 --> 38:33.855
Turn it off.

38:44.701 --> 38:46.077
Relax, my friend.

38:46.326 --> 38:47.453
I talked to Bill.

38:47.745 --> 38:51.123
- He told me we need 2200 pounds...
- Why did you talk to him?

38:53.542 --> 38:55.794
We need 2200 pounds for next
week.

38:56.712 --> 38:58.130
With what they've sowed,

38:58.214 --> 38:59.757
we can collect 1300 pounds.

38:59.841 --> 39:01.092
We need more.

39:01.884 --> 39:03.344
Aníbal is coming here, Moncho.

39:03.761 --> 39:05.846
Let's buy from someone else.

39:06.179 --> 39:08.808
Aníbal is family. We've always done
business with him.

39:08.891 --> 39:11.101
We'll deliver 1300 pounds.
That's it.

39:16.149 --> 39:18.067
And I'm the middleman, is that
clear?

40:09.451 --> 40:11.453
Hello, cousin.

40:12.455 --> 40:14.040
Pure Santa Marta Gold.

40:14.290 --> 40:15.875
From the seeds of the Americans?

41:08.719 --> 41:09.678
What do you say, Moncho?

41:09.761 --> 41:10.846
What's up, Ramírez?

41:11.471 --> 41:12.848
Getting fatter.

41:13.141 --> 41:14.809
And you, uglier.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.686
And Rafa,

41:16.978 --> 41:18.855
charming as usual.

41:26.194 --> 41:27.863
Be serious, Moncho.

42:44.065 --> 42:45.149
What's wrong?

42:47.359 --> 42:49.486
Two planes can carry 1300 pounds.

42:54.533 --> 42:56.076
Fifty pounds in five.

43:04.167 --> 43:05.711
Why are there three planes?

43:10.132 --> 43:13.051
Bill said there was no problem.

43:17.515 --> 43:19.850
Are you doing business with other people?

43:30.652 --> 43:31.946
It's full of weed!

43:39.578 --> 43:41.371
Tell Bill business is done with us only.

43:41.455 --> 43:43.749
I'll hold on to the planes
until he makes up for this.

43:43.833 --> 43:44.917
Hell no!

43:49.129 --> 43:50.255
What did you do?

43:50.339 --> 43:51.673
They betrayed us!

43:53.051 --> 43:54.886
That's what the word is for.

43:56.638 --> 43:59.015
So send a word messenger
to the United States.

44:00.475 --> 44:02.101
If you kill him, I'll kill you.

44:04.145 --> 44:06.813
Don't you wanna keep
the money and the weed?

44:07.565 --> 44:09.400
You have no respect for anything.

44:20.745 --> 44:22.746
Tell Bill business is done with us.

44:29.002 --> 44:31.421
Us Wayúu can't touch murdered men.

44:33.091 --> 44:34.717
You'll have to bury them.

44:35.717 --> 44:37.219
What shall we do with the planes?

45:17.719 --> 45:20.471
You can't do business with alijunas.

45:21.681 --> 45:23.266
And gringos? What are they?

45:24.266 --> 45:27.312
Or do you know any Wayúu
that'll buy weed from us?

45:27.812 --> 45:29.313
Moisés is out of control.

45:32.317 --> 45:34.193
He made a mistake.

45:35.236 --> 45:36.821
He's staining our name.

45:39.906 --> 45:41.700
Disobeyed you in front of your men.

45:44.078 --> 45:45.580
It won't happen again.

45:46.748 --> 45:48.791
Ask yourself,
where does your loyalty lie?

45:49.333 --> 45:51.669
With the alijunas or your family?

45:53.129 --> 45:55.924
My word and honor lie with my people.

46:12.105 --> 46:14.859
He's right. Who do you choose?

46:15.652 --> 46:16.945
I already said it.

46:17.946 --> 46:19.322
Say it again.

46:20.656 --> 46:22.408
My family.

46:24.826 --> 46:26.995
So get rid of Moisés.

46:30.375 --> 46:33.169
How will you carry on
doing business after this?

46:33.877 --> 46:36.922
How will you ease the gringos?

46:38.507 --> 46:41.051
You must compensate them.

46:41.134 --> 46:43.888
Don't put your family at risk.

46:46.181 --> 46:49.643
You've been
with the alijunas for too long.

46:50.018 --> 46:53.939
A true Wayúu wouldn't hesitate, Rapayet.

47:00.862 --> 47:03.573
The alijuna spilled blood, Rapayet.

47:04.033 --> 47:06.618
He must pay with blood.

47:57.170 --> 47:58.212
Rafa!

47:59.129 --> 48:02.257
Come, listen to the song
they wrote for us, my friend.

48:34.540 --> 48:35.375
Rafa!

48:35.708 --> 48:37.877
I'm glad you came, my friend.

48:43.924 --> 48:45.551
Is this how you spend the money?

48:46.761 --> 48:47.804
What's wrong?

48:47.886 --> 48:50.138
We have the money, the weed...

48:50.223 --> 48:52.558
It's the best deal, Rafa.

48:52.933 --> 48:53.892
Come.

48:54.143 --> 48:54.936
Let's party.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.103
Get up!

49:02.694 --> 49:03.736
What's the matter?

49:05.779 --> 49:07.114
Are you not gonna celebrate?

49:08.116 --> 49:09.158
It's over.

49:11.118 --> 49:12.035
What?

49:13.538 --> 49:16.040
You spilled blood in Wayúu territory.

49:16.123 --> 49:20.044
The foreigners' blood must be compensated.

49:24.966 --> 49:26.384
Shut the fuck up!

49:30.013 --> 49:32.015
The Pushaina family

49:32.181 --> 49:34.016
advised Rapayet

49:34.308 --> 49:35.685
to kill you.

49:39.688 --> 49:41.065
But it won't happen,

49:41.232 --> 49:43.359
because Rapayet is fond of you.

49:43.609 --> 49:45.819
But you have to leave the business.

49:52.909 --> 49:54.203
Everyone leave!

49:54.621 --> 49:55.997
Get out!

49:57.290 --> 49:58.750
This shit is over!

50:06.132 --> 50:07.675
You can't do this, Rafa.

50:08.551 --> 50:13.640
For every deal, you'll get a commission
to give the police their cut.

50:13.890 --> 50:16.600
But if you do any business
behind Rapayet's back,

50:16.725 --> 50:19.603
he'll have to follow his clan's advice.

50:24.567 --> 50:26.152
You can't do this to me, Rafa.

50:28.112 --> 50:29.822
You would be nothing without me.

50:31.699 --> 50:32.992
Aren't we friends?

50:33.868 --> 50:35.370
Aren't we brothers, Rafa?

50:46.255 --> 50:47.257
Rafa!

51:10.029 --> 51:11.656
Get down, Leonidas.

51:16.159 --> 51:17.870
You drive too fast.

51:18.746 --> 51:20.248
We're leaving.

51:21.790 --> 51:23.167
Where are you going?

51:24.377 --> 51:25.712
To make a delivery.

51:26.879 --> 51:27.964
Can I go?

51:35.929 --> 51:37.431
Be careful, Rapayet.

51:39.516 --> 51:40.435
Look.

51:42.060 --> 51:46.231
The iishcoo bird has been coming for days.

51:47.357 --> 51:49.276
He's asking for payback.

52:17.388 --> 52:18.264
Nothing.

52:20.641 --> 52:23.352
It's been too long.
Something's not right.

52:27.982 --> 52:28.942
Leonidas.

52:29.984 --> 52:30.985
Leonidas!

52:34.154 --> 52:35.322
Are we leaving?

52:35.406 --> 52:36.824
No, go back.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.076
You never let me do anything!

52:39.993 --> 52:43.246
You're here because they forced me
to bring you along. Do as I say!

53:19.283 --> 53:20.492
Don't get out!

53:45.685 --> 53:47.103
Go tell Aníbal.

53:47.312 --> 53:50.230
Tell him to bring the women.
I'll stay here.

55:22.197 --> 55:23.408
I go alone.

56:20.882 --> 56:21.925
Get dressed.

56:23.384 --> 56:25.136
You don't have to turn me in, Rafa.

56:27.513 --> 56:29.681
I have your share. I kept it for you.

56:31.391 --> 56:32.935
We can keep going, you and I.

56:33.937 --> 56:35.063
Just like before.

56:38.565 --> 56:40.067
So, what are you going to do?

56:41.361 --> 56:42.527
Are you going to kill me?

56:45.156 --> 56:46.699
You can't kill me, my friend.

56:53.830 --> 56:55.290
I'll kill you like the Wayúu do,

56:56.833 --> 56:57.877
face to face.

57:00.545 --> 57:02.631
We've always been together, Rafa.

57:04.801 --> 57:06.052
You're my brother.

57:15.103 --> 57:16.437
I knew you didn't have it in you.

58:22.962 --> 58:24.964
Don't come inside!

58:25.797 --> 58:27.382
His blood is all over you.

58:27.634 --> 58:30.053
The yoluja is with you!

58:31.011 --> 58:32.554
It's your fault, Mom.

58:32.721 --> 58:36.100
Your daughter has just been born!
Stay away!

58:37.060 --> 58:39.770
You brought the ghost
of a dead man with you.

58:53.116 --> 58:54.618
You can't touch her.

58:58.748 --> 58:59.666
Indira.

59:02.710 --> 59:03.795
How's Zaida?

59:04.712 --> 59:05.880
She's fine.

59:12.136 --> 59:13.221
I want to go in.

59:15.806 --> 59:17.725
You have touched him.

59:17.808 --> 59:20.143
If you don't clean yourself,
it will stick to her.

59:27.777 --> 59:29.070
I'll go take a bath.

59:30.071 --> 59:30.822
No.

59:30.904 --> 59:33.156
Aníbal must see the blood.

01:00:07.817 --> 01:00:08.735
Aníbal.

01:00:09.192 --> 01:00:11.446
I've come to talk to you.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:15.074
I don't want anything to do with Rapayet.

01:00:15.283 --> 01:00:17.326
It's not about Rapayet.

01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:20.954
I come on behalf of Úrsula Pushaina.
Will you not receive her word?

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.627
Over the last two years,

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.755
the wealth of both families
has increased like never before.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.966
Prosperity can only bloom
if there's peace.

01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:38.388
Moisés killed my brother.
Rapayet didn't stop him on time.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.973
You're right, Aníbal.

01:00:40.391 --> 01:00:43.436
But he's done it now.
Peace is guaranteed.

01:00:45.062 --> 01:00:47.689
I don't want to do business
with Rapayet anymore.

01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:52.194
When you talk to Rapayet,
you talk to the Pushaina clan.

01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:57.699
What's your answer?

01:01:00.203 --> 01:01:02.413
I want 100 pesos per pound.

01:01:11.214 --> 01:01:14.174
Very well, Aníbal.

01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:43.996
SONG III
PROSPERITY

01:03:54.544 --> 01:03:55.545
Son!

01:03:56.295 --> 01:03:57.922
You were great.

01:03:58.714 --> 01:04:01.133
You rode like a true Wayúu.

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:04.219
I almost finished last.

01:04:04.846 --> 01:04:06.097
It doesn't matter.

01:04:06.888 --> 01:04:09.433
None of them rode at your age.

01:04:10.143 --> 01:04:13.938
I want to learn
how to fly a plane, not ride a horse.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.958
Leonidas, give me the gun.

01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:36.294
Don't bother me.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:50.433
Give me the gun, son.

01:04:53.018 --> 01:04:54.312
Give me the gun.

01:05:50.368 --> 01:05:54.080
The sacrifice has been made,
but there's sadness.

01:05:57.583 --> 01:06:00.086
Gabriel is announcing his second burial.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:06.133
The dead are coming to the house.
Miguel is in danger.

01:06:10.138 --> 01:06:12.556
Rapayet and Leonidas were there.

01:06:17.437 --> 01:06:18.438
Did you see them?

01:06:20.897 --> 01:06:21.774
No.

01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:31.158
Request the talisman's protection.

01:07:29.926 --> 01:07:32.136
You're not alone, Rapayet.

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:37.015
Have you seen a yoluja?

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:40.770
Hi, nephew.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.146
Hi, uncle.

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:48.652
Aníbal invited us
to his brother's second wake.

01:07:54.158 --> 01:07:56.828
Zaida saw Gabriel in a dream.

01:07:58.578 --> 01:08:02.499
Maybe he was announcing himself too,
like he did to his family.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:05.294
We must go, Rapayet.

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:10.966
Aníbal is not just family,
he's our partner.

01:08:11.301 --> 01:08:12.552
We shouldn't go.

01:08:14.386 --> 01:08:18.849
If we don't, he will take it
as an offense to his family.

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:20.559
Do you want that?

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.979
Zaida also saw Miguel. He was covered.

01:08:26.608 --> 01:08:28.693
There's too much death around.

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.337
Thank you for inviting us, cousin.

01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:51.256
What is it that you got there?

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:56.803
The Pushaina family wants to celebrate
its friendship with your family.

01:08:57.095 --> 01:09:02.475
It's a gift for the wake.
Ten cows and 30 goats.

01:09:03.019 --> 01:09:04.062
Thank you.

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:13.111
Each gun has its own license.

01:09:18.658 --> 01:09:21.703
A bit too much, don't you think?

01:09:23.831 --> 01:09:25.416
Thank you for coming, Úrsula.

01:09:28.044 --> 01:09:29.086
Join me.

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.926
Let's get out of here, Rapayet.

01:10:27.437 --> 01:10:31.189
Now is the time when the dead come back.

01:10:32.024 --> 01:10:35.068
The time to understand what happened.

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:40.574
Why they are gone and what is
the message they're bringing us.

01:10:41.533 --> 01:10:45.746
The time for us to listen

01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:50.585
to what they are teaching us

01:10:52.086 --> 01:10:57.050
through their senseless death,

01:10:58.675 --> 01:11:03.722
caused by blind ambition.

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:08.936
Now that we are exhuming you

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:16.277
and taking you
to your final resting place,

01:11:17.946 --> 01:11:22.449
let us be still.
Let us listen and understand

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:27.037
why you had to leave like this.

01:11:28.915 --> 01:11:33.169
Let us not be blind.

01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:38.341
Let us not be deaf.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:44.429
Let no gold shine brighter
than our spirit.

01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:49.768
Let no voice or gunshot
be louder than your voice.

01:13:17.648 --> 01:13:19.900
What on earth are you doing? Come with me!

01:13:27.367 --> 01:13:29.202
Burials are so boring.

01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:32.830
Why did you come, then?

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:38.419
Because I was forced.

01:14:06.698 --> 01:14:08.408
Look what I can do.

01:14:55.371 --> 01:14:56.331
For you,

01:14:56.831 --> 01:14:58.625
I'd eat a lemon and its skin.

01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:09.551
Come with me to Aruba.
I'll give you anything you want.

01:15:10.428 --> 01:15:12.513
Sigifredo, take this drunkard away.

01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:18.060
Let's dance.

01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:21.104
Come dance with me.

01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:23.857
- Leave!
- Don't touch her!

01:15:24.317 --> 01:15:25.902
No one can touch her.

01:15:26.068 --> 01:15:27.194
Mister Leonidas.

01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:29.656
Let's go, sir. You're drunk.

01:15:36.996 --> 01:15:39.290
Bring the money from the truck.

01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:45.296
- No, Leonidas.
- Bring the money from the fucking truck!

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.728
This man wants to become
some kind of a lawyer.

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:05.066
Look how generous I am.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.903
I'll pay for his degree and his trip,

01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:12.364
but only if he eats that dog's shit.

01:16:20.665 --> 01:16:21.666
No, sir.

01:16:32.385 --> 01:16:33.344
No, sir.

01:16:35.179 --> 01:16:37.890
Too proud for a shitty bodyguard.

01:16:40.393 --> 01:16:41.394
Put it there.

01:16:48.025 --> 01:16:49.359
It's all yours.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:53.156
You can pay for whores
and anything you want.

01:17:48.294 --> 01:17:50.337
You're the man, boss.

01:18:38.553 --> 01:18:39.470
Hello.

01:18:41.305 --> 01:18:42.848
I come on behalf of mister Aníbal.

01:18:43.349 --> 01:18:45.310
Word must be brought by a word messenger.

01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:51.232
I'm the word messenger now.

01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:54.359
I won't receive the word from an alijuna.

01:18:55.819 --> 01:18:57.029
What does Aníbal want?

01:18:58.448 --> 01:19:00.908
This is not the way we do things.

01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:05.412
Mister Aníbal wants to be compensated.

01:19:05.662 --> 01:19:06.955
With two trucks,

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.208
ten mules,

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:11.001
and two rifles.

01:19:11.085 --> 01:19:14.130
We won't compensate him
until he sends a word messenger!

01:19:16.424 --> 01:19:17.550
What else?

01:19:21.511 --> 01:19:23.014
And two weeks of mister Leonidas,

01:19:23.473 --> 01:19:24.890
working as a peasant in his fields.

01:19:24.974 --> 01:19:26.100
Say that again and I’ll kill you!

01:19:26.224 --> 01:19:27.434
Put the gun down!

01:19:27.644 --> 01:19:29.145
Let Leonidas kill him!

01:19:30.063 --> 01:19:33.232
- Aníbal knows no Wayúu would accept that.
- Shut up!

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.524
Shut up!

01:19:38.571 --> 01:19:40.156
Leonidas, go.

01:19:48.206 --> 01:19:50.833
By sending the alijuna,
Aníbal is humiliating you.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:54.962
You can't accept anything.

01:19:55.755 --> 01:19:57.799
We have offended his family many times.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.473
If you don't agree,
there will be a war, Rapayet.

01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:07.391
You can't let that happen.

01:20:09.059 --> 01:20:10.352
Do you need a minute?

01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:15.900
A little work won't harm him.

01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:25.158
Leonidas will fulfill
his part of the compensation.

01:21:17.127 --> 01:21:18.462
What's wrong?

01:21:22.175 --> 01:21:23.967
Did you see it again?

01:21:31.725 --> 01:21:33.018
It'll go away.

01:21:33.226 --> 01:21:34.729
Close your eyes.

01:22:05.009 --> 01:22:07.011
Welcome, mister Leonidas.

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:21.400
What do we have here?

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.680
Here's your compensation.

01:22:53.349 --> 01:22:54.851
You offended my daughter.

01:22:55.809 --> 01:22:57.477
Apologize and you can go home.

01:23:07.697 --> 01:23:09.032
Apologize!

01:23:13.161 --> 01:23:14.746
Go to work then.

01:23:39.519 --> 01:23:43.148
The satchel is like the Wayúu.

01:23:44.067 --> 01:23:47.904
Round like the mother's womb.
This rope, it's umbilical cord.

01:23:48.613 --> 01:23:49.614
Indira.

01:23:50.073 --> 01:23:51.074
It's late.

01:23:51.698 --> 01:23:53.201
We haven't finished.

01:23:54.661 --> 01:23:56.287
You can finish tomorrow.

01:24:05.212 --> 01:24:06.546
It's important.

01:24:08.049 --> 01:24:09.634
You can finish tomorrow.

01:24:20.812 --> 01:24:23.022
I'll stay here until you fall asleep.

01:24:53.928 --> 01:24:55.596
What were you dreaming?

01:24:57.431 --> 01:25:00.309
Nothing. It felt as if I was falling.

01:25:02.185 --> 01:25:03.270
What else?

01:25:05.857 --> 01:25:07.108
Nothing.

01:25:12.654 --> 01:25:14.948
You don't talk to the dream anymore.

01:25:26.544 --> 01:25:29.671
I killed you because
you had no respect for the word.

01:25:30.924 --> 01:25:33.842
And now,
no one respects anything, my friend.

01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:36.386
I can't lose my family again.

01:25:39.181 --> 01:25:41.099
I can't lose them in another war.

01:25:43.353 --> 01:25:45.730
What does the yoluja tell you?

01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:51.109
Nothing.

01:25:51.443 --> 01:25:52.778
He's just there.

01:25:55.073 --> 01:25:56.491
Bring Leonidas back.

01:25:59.702 --> 01:26:02.372
This won't end here.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.375
Did the dream tell you that?

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.297
No.

01:26:13.299 --> 01:26:14.967
The spirits are offended.

01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:19.013
The dream hasn't talked to me
since we went to Aníbal's.

01:26:21.474 --> 01:26:24.185
We've lost the soul.

01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:28.773
Nothing protects us anymore.

01:26:30.483 --> 01:26:31.317
Rapayet.

01:26:32.527 --> 01:26:33.611
Bring my son back.

01:26:33.987 --> 01:26:36.072
You should've never agreed
to send him away.

01:29:39.714 --> 01:29:44.928
SONG IV
THE WAR

01:30:09.034 --> 01:30:10.077
Now that one.

01:30:23.757 --> 01:30:26.510
I'll be safe if I'm surrounded by men.

01:30:32.015 --> 01:30:34.184
Those shitty necklaces are useless!

01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:49.199
Don't let him out.

01:30:49.742 --> 01:30:52.745
If someone comes, tell them
your daughter is in confinement.

01:31:26.237 --> 01:31:27.154
Aníbal.

01:31:28.197 --> 01:31:33.118
In a dispute, it isn't common for the
offending party to send a word messenger.

01:31:33.202 --> 01:31:36.205
But I've come to bring you the word.

01:31:36.413 --> 01:31:40.960
Rapayet wants to avoid war at all cost.
He wants to compensate you.

01:31:42.754 --> 01:31:47.257
What Leonidas did is unforgivable.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:52.096
He's a bad seed
who doesn't represent his family.

01:31:53.473 --> 01:31:55.265
There's nothing to talk about.

01:31:55.724 --> 01:31:57.726
He dishonored my daughter.

01:31:58.269 --> 01:31:59.437
He's a Pushaina.

01:31:59.895 --> 01:32:02.439
There's more at stake.

01:32:02.773 --> 01:32:09.112
Your relationship with Rapayet and
his family goes well beyond this dispute.

01:32:12.867 --> 01:32:14.869
You shouldn't have come, Peregrino.

01:32:17.287 --> 01:32:22.209
We're living
violent, uncertain times, Aníbal.

01:32:22.626 --> 01:32:28.966
You can't turn down Rapayet's offer
without even listening.

01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:34.596
What is he offering?

01:32:34.889 --> 01:32:36.140
Everything.

01:32:36.599 --> 01:32:41.062
His trucks, planes,
landing spots, everything.

01:32:41.144 --> 01:32:44.982
Even his American connections.

01:32:55.242 --> 01:32:56.285
No.

01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:04.544
Aníbal.

01:33:05.211 --> 01:33:07.213
You can't kill a word messenger.

01:33:07.755 --> 01:33:12.467
If you kill the word, you'll be offending
the most sacred law of the Wayúu.

01:33:12.969 --> 01:33:15.721
You will not only go to war
with the Pushaina clan,

01:33:15.805 --> 01:33:19.100
but also with the Uliana clan,
your own clan.

01:34:31.546 --> 01:34:33.257
Do you still want peace?

01:34:48.439 --> 01:34:49.649
Let's go, Rapayet.

01:34:59.157 --> 01:35:02.536
You know what happens to a family
in a war.

01:35:02.662 --> 01:35:03.579
Let's go.

01:35:05.122 --> 01:35:06.373
Where?

01:35:09.251 --> 01:35:12.129
Wherever they won't find us.
It doesn't matter.

01:35:14.172 --> 01:35:17.719
Moisés will follow me wherever I go.

01:35:18.428 --> 01:35:20.179
It doesn't matter, Rapayet.

01:35:25.184 --> 01:35:27.270
Miguel is in danger.
I saw it in the dream.

01:35:57.175 --> 01:35:59.344
Don't come back until you've found them.

01:36:17.111 --> 01:36:18.738
Are they Aníbal's people?

01:36:20.864 --> 01:36:21.782
No.

01:36:23.283 --> 01:36:26.411
They're the word messengers
and the clans' elders.

01:36:50.687 --> 01:36:55.024
Aníbal Abuchaibe, from the Uliana clan,
committed the unrepairable

01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:59.069
and murdered a word messenger.

01:36:59.862 --> 01:37:04.408
He has become a threat to our clan
and to the region's peace.

01:37:05.076 --> 01:37:07.453
It's our duty to keep him
from spreading chaos.

01:37:07.537 --> 01:37:10.915
Ever since he started trading weed,

01:37:11.081 --> 01:37:14.042
Peregrino fell like the bird Utta,

01:37:14.919 --> 01:37:19.090
whose necklaces were so heavy
from being so wealthy.

01:37:19.256 --> 01:37:21.842
He stopped being a word messenger
and died as an alijuna.

01:37:21.925 --> 01:37:27.014
He was a remarkable Wayúu
and we shouldn't mention his name.

01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:32.102
Let's not forget no one
had ever killed a word messenger.

01:37:32.394 --> 01:37:37.858
Peregrino allowed Úrsula's family
to desecrate our traditions.

01:37:38.775 --> 01:37:42.904
Our word messenger died trying
to prevent this war.

01:37:43.698 --> 01:37:48.161
We must stop Aníbal before
his war spreads throughout the Wajira.

01:37:49.037 --> 01:37:51.873
We can do it if we unite.

01:37:55.835 --> 01:37:57.252
Where is Rapayet?

01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:59.296
He ran away.

01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:06.595
Úrsula and Rapayet
use their sacred cemetery

01:38:06.763 --> 01:38:10.975
to hide money and weapons.

01:38:11.893 --> 01:38:16.814
Aníbal, Úrsula and Rapayet
have stained our clan's name.

01:38:17.023 --> 01:38:19.984
They no longer act as Wayúus.

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.237
They act as alijunas.

01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:26.073
Us Wayúus are not what they have become.

01:38:26.239 --> 01:38:29.577
I won't order my family to lend
their lives for a dispute of alijunas.

01:38:29.786 --> 01:38:33.581
My family will not be a part
of this vengeance either.

01:38:33.747 --> 01:38:37.085
This has always been our territory.

01:38:37.376 --> 01:38:41.004
We've always protected it
with honor and bravery

01:38:41.214 --> 01:38:43.757
when it has been necessary.

01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:47.136
Our ancestors defended it from pirates,

01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:51.474
from Englishmen, from Spaniards.

01:38:51.933 --> 01:38:55.937
And from the governments that tried
to take it away and tell us how to live.

01:38:56.019 --> 01:39:00.524
This ain't alijunas' territory,
it's our ancestors'.

01:39:01.024 --> 01:39:05.279
We won't allow these new weed sellers
to fill it with violence.

01:39:05.947 --> 01:39:08.616
Punishment for Aníbal and his family!

01:39:08.824 --> 01:39:10.158
This has to stop.

01:39:12.202 --> 01:39:16.248
Violence against the word
is unprecedented.

01:39:16.873 --> 01:39:19.251
It has to be punished.

01:39:19.544 --> 01:39:23.506
But before we punish Aníbal,
Úrsula's family has to compensate us.

01:39:23.797 --> 01:39:27.135
They must give up this cemetery
and exhume their dead.

01:39:27.301 --> 01:39:31.471
Úrsula must give back the talisman that
protects her family, and her necklaces.

01:39:32.889 --> 01:39:33.974
Give it back.

01:39:34.309 --> 01:39:37.145
The Arpushana family agrees
on the punishment,

01:39:37.312 --> 01:39:39.897
if Úrsula gives back
the talisman and necklaces.

01:39:40.064 --> 01:39:45.069
The Juusayú family will send men
to help with Aníbal's punishment.

01:39:46.653 --> 01:39:50.657
The Epieyúu family joins the punishment
for the Pushaina and Abuchaibe families.

01:40:20.479 --> 01:40:21.939
Goyo, Goyo, Goyo.

01:40:22.898 --> 01:40:23.982
Over.

01:40:28.528 --> 01:40:30.447
Clean everything up. We're coming over.

01:40:30.614 --> 01:40:32.282
Pick up, pick up. Over.

01:40:37.788 --> 01:40:39.581
Pick up, Goyo. We're coming.

01:40:39.623 --> 01:40:40.666
Over.

01:41:37.348 --> 01:41:38.433
Go inside!

01:42:12.966 --> 01:42:15.969
I've come for you and my grandchildren.

01:42:21.059 --> 01:42:21.851
No.

01:42:25.438 --> 01:42:27.440
You belong with me, daughter.

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:40.119
You can't live as a Wayúu
if you're away from your family.

01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:44.165
What's the use
of being a Wayúu if we die.

01:43:15.321 --> 01:43:18.573
Come with me and Rapayet won't be hurt.

01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:31.296
Don't take them away. Please.
Don't do this.

01:44:13.004 --> 01:44:16.549
If you come looking for them,
I'll kill you.

01:45:20.363 --> 01:45:21.447
How many did they kill?

01:45:25.702 --> 01:45:27.453
You don't want to know.

01:45:29.538 --> 01:45:30.998
What about the sown fields?

01:45:33.458 --> 01:45:34.460
Mister Aníbal,

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:37.130
it's a miracle
those Indians didn't kill us.

01:45:40.757 --> 01:45:42.676
I've had it. I'm going back to Medellín.

01:45:43.219 --> 01:45:44.721
There's nothing left to do here.

01:45:46.096 --> 01:45:47.889
Bring me men from Medellín.

01:45:49.975 --> 01:45:52.019
You can have what's left of the crops.

01:45:52.103 --> 01:45:53.855
They burned everything down.

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:55.398
There's nothing left.

01:45:56.064 --> 01:45:59.277
I have 2800 pounds left.
Only I know where they are.

01:46:01.446 --> 01:46:05.241
You can have the house, the cars,
the hidden money, everything.

01:46:27.639 --> 01:46:31.225
Are you willing to give up everything
just to have your revenge?

01:46:34.854 --> 01:46:36.356
How soon can you bring them?

01:50:09.861 --> 01:50:11.778
There's money in the satchel.

01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:16.158
Go find Leonidas.

01:50:25.292 --> 01:50:26.501
Go.

01:50:30.089 --> 01:50:32.382
Go and never come back!

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:43.686
Go!

01:50:46.397 --> 01:50:47.314
Go!

01:50:58.533 --> 01:51:03.038
SONG V
LIMBO

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:20.682
Uncle!

01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:26.813
Uncle Leonidas!

01:51:51.254 --> 01:51:52.212
And so?

01:51:54.924 --> 01:51:57.801
We have nothing left
in this world, Aníbal.

01:52:00.388 --> 01:52:02.265
But have some respect for the dead.

01:52:03.015 --> 01:52:04.474
Give me my grandson back.

01:52:07.604 --> 01:52:10.023
I'll give him back on two conditions.

01:52:12.108 --> 01:52:13.650
Hand over your businesses,

01:52:14.359 --> 01:52:16.528
the weed you have left, your planes,

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:20.533
- your landing strips...
- I came to talk to you, not to him.

01:52:22.034 --> 01:52:24.412
He's the one you need to talk to now.

01:52:26.913 --> 01:52:29.583
Arrange one more delivery
with your connection.

01:52:32.461 --> 01:52:33.962
What's the other thing?

01:52:35.672 --> 01:52:37.090
Bring me Rapayet.

01:52:37.341 --> 01:52:38.425
And Leonidas.

01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:42.679
Leonidas is dead.

01:52:43.764 --> 01:52:46.767
- Then tell me where Rapayet is.
- I want Leonidas as well.

01:52:46.893 --> 01:52:48.226
Shut the fuck up!

01:52:48.644 --> 01:52:49.853
You'll do what I say.

01:52:50.479 --> 01:52:52.189
Settle for Rapayet.

01:52:53.774 --> 01:52:55.400
I'll give you Rapayet.

01:52:57.111 --> 01:52:58.237
You can kill me.

01:52:59.613 --> 01:53:01.239
Let Indira live.

01:53:01.823 --> 01:53:03.992
You're not even worth the bullet, ma'am.

01:54:58.273 --> 01:54:59.650
Where is Leonidas?

01:55:06.157 --> 01:55:07.784
I won't stop until I kill him.

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:11.371
We're all dead already.

01:56:24.234 --> 01:56:25.569
Take them.

01:56:58.101 --> 01:57:02.564
And so, when I saw this Wayúu girl
who didn't know how to herd,

01:57:02.732 --> 01:57:06.861
who had forgotten her ancestor's knowledge
and was left alone to wander

01:57:06.944 --> 01:57:10.156
in the desert and in the dark,
is how I learned about this story.

01:57:10.238 --> 01:57:14.660
A story about a wild grass that came
as a savior, but destroyed like locusts.

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:17.997
This grass took other shapes
and it was always joined by greed.

01:57:18.122 --> 01:57:20.375
And so a great wanulü beast was awakened,

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:25.296
and its shadow darkened the whole world.

01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:29.092
If we had only listened to the dreams,
if we had only heard the dead's voices.

01:57:29.259 --> 01:57:34.138
Strong winds are coming now.
They'll erase our footprints on the sand,

01:57:34.471 --> 01:57:37.058
that's why I sing on this day.

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:42.063
So Wayúus and alijunas won't forget
what the summer winds erase.

01:57:42.188 --> 01:57:45.440
So that the birds can sing this story,
so it can remain forever,

01:57:45.608 --> 01:57:48.987
in the place of dreams and memory.
