Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.500 --> 00:07.540
We gotta get this place
in shape. We're selling it.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.210
You're selling the house?

Andi's gonna be devastated.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.380
That's why you should be
prepared when you tell her.

00:15.380 --> 00:17.120
There's something I have
to tell you.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.120
What?

00:20.040 --> 00:21.750
We also have vanilla wafers.

00:21.750 --> 00:22.790
Yay!

00:24.290 --> 00:27.500
Excuse me. Just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm the new principal,

00:27.500 --> 00:31.000
Dr. Metcalf. I want you to know,
I'm not a scary principal,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.790
I'm an approachable one. I don't see
any reason why we can't be friends.

00:33.790 --> 00:36.330
Andi, I like being around you
more than anyone else.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.960
-Oh. -So I was wondering...
maybe you could think about

00:39.960 --> 00:42.120
being around me?

00:42.120 --> 00:45.170
Jonah asked me the simplest
question, "What's your next class?"

00:45.170 --> 00:47.460
Which is English,

00:47.460 --> 00:49.290
Dimples.

Buffy, what's happening
to me?

00:51.420 --> 00:55.330

was the first time I ever talked to him.

-Lay it on us.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.210
Should Jonah and I
be holding hands by now?

Mm-hm... healthy nail
beds, no calluses,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.620
good-sized knuckles.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.500
I don't see any reason
not to be holding this hand.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.580
And yet, he isn't holding it.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.290
Hm. Perhaps you suffer
from hyperhidrosis.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.380
Sweaty palms.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.620
They don't look sweaty,
they don't feel sweaty--

You're not nervous when
you're holding your own hand.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.330
So if I'm holding Jonah's hand,
it can just happen?

-What is?
-You're fixin' up the yard.

told you were selling the house.

you were actually gonna do it.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.880
Right. Because if there's one quality
I'm typically associated with,

of this house, remember?

06:36.040 --> 06:38.330
Twice! What do you care
if we're sellin' it?

06:38.330 --> 06:40.040
'Cause when Andi finds out,
she's go--

06:40.040 --> 06:42.290
Wait. Why haven't you told her?

06:42.290 --> 06:44.830

10:07.080 --> 10:08.620
Of course she cares.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.830
A lot. That's why she
wants you to tell her.

10:11.830 --> 10:13.460
She can't bear
to do it herself.

10:13.460 --> 10:16.330
Well, if it's so hard,
why sell the house at all?

10:16.330 --> 10:18.620
Because they don't need
all that space.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.040
It's just the two of them.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.670
If they move out, then they
can live their own lives.

10:24.670 --> 10:28.170
And they can travel,
and have their own adventures.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.040
Like we did.

10:32.040 --> 10:36.120
I know I didn't live there for long,
but I still thought of it as home.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.920
And it's Andi's home.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.250
If I'd never moved her out,
they wouldn't have to sell it.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.120
Huh.
Ironic, isn't it?

10:46.120 --> 10:47.420
If I'm using that word right.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.500
I'm never sure.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.960
You are.

10:53.380 --> 10:54.920
I think.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.540
But if you aren't using it correctly
and I just said you were,

10:57.540 --> 10:59.000
that would be ironic.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.040

-I think.
-Mm-hm...

11:22.960 --> 11:24.540

12:47.210 --> 12:51.290
No. I left so quickly I had
to leave everything behind.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.210
(students groaning)

12:54.210 --> 12:56.460
Geez. Group "B"
is kinda judge-y.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.460
Cyrus is at the gate.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.460
Cyrus!

13:06.460 --> 13:10.170
Group "B" students:
Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

13:10.170 --> 13:14.290
Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

13:14.290 --> 13:18.880
I don't need a cheer. It was
enough that I blazed the trail.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.000
(laughs)

13:24.120 --> 13:25.540
I smell something.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.750
Cookies.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.120
Buffy:
Freshly baked cookies.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.540
We won't be able to get any. They're
going straight to Group "A."

13:35.540 --> 13:37.540
No!
We can't let that happen!

13:37.540 --> 13:41.040
Or maybe... we can.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.580
Cyrus, I need you.

13:45.580 --> 13:46.830
Come on, go.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.790
Hi, we're from Group "A."
The smell is driving us crazy.

13:50.790 --> 13:52.210
We're just gonna
take these out for you.

13:52.210 --> 13:53.580
Group "A" forever!

13:53.580 --> 13:54.790
Run!

13:54.790 --> 13:56.420
Oh, right, I'm an athlete now.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.250
(screams)

14:01.250 --> 14:07.040
(screaming and yelling)

14:11.210 --> 14:13.380
-(screaming and yelling)
-I'm hit!

14:13.380 --> 14:14.750
It's cocktail sauce!

14:15.790 --> 14:17.210
Five second rule!

14:17.210 --> 14:20.920
(screaming and yelling)

14:20.920 --> 14:22.170
(blowing whistle)

14:24.290 --> 14:27.620
Today's exercise is over.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.790
There's no more group "A",
there is no more group "B."

14:33.750 --> 14:36.790
And we're not eating cookies
off the floor, Denise.

14:41.460 --> 14:46.170
Can anyone tell me
the point of today's exercise?

14:46.170 --> 14:48.580
It's about privilege.

14:48.580 --> 14:52.250
It's about one group thinking that
they deserve more than another.

14:53.420 --> 14:57.290
Just because of the color
of their wristband.

14:57.290 --> 15:00.250
But the people in group "A"
were better.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.670
Better at what?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.290
Good question.

15:06.290 --> 15:10.330
How did I decide
who got to be in group "A"?

15:10.330 --> 15:11.500
It was completely random.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.540
Wrong.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.960
I don't know.
You just said, "Andi, group 'A',

15:17.960 --> 15:19.120
Buffy, group 'B'..."

15:19.120 --> 15:20.460
Keep going.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.620
Keep going?
Going where?

15:22.620 --> 15:29.290
Cyrus, group "A," Denise,
group "B," Aaron, group "A",

15:29.290 --> 15:32.790
Farrah, group "B"...

15:32.790 --> 15:36.750
You used the first letter of our
names, and just went back and forth.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.420
Right.

15:38.420 --> 15:41.040
So, it was
every other letter.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.330
"A," "C," "E,"
were in the "A" group,

15:43.330 --> 15:45.380
"B", "D," "F"
were in the "B" group.

15:45.380 --> 15:50.330
And so on. Nobody here is
better than anyone else.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.210
Nobody anywhere
is better than anywhere else.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.120
A lot of problems
wouldn't even be problems

15:58.120 --> 16:00.620
if we all just accepted
that simple fact.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.210
I hope you all
learned that today.

16:04.830 --> 16:08.460
Because the school board has hired a social
sensitivity consultant, and she's asked

16:08.460 --> 16:10.670
for all your feedback.
(laughs)

16:10.670 --> 16:12.330
(students all talking)

16:12.330 --> 16:15.120
Later. Later.
In writing.

16:16.670 --> 16:19.290
Dr. Metcalf: And we need people
to clean up. I choose all of you.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.210
(laughter)

16:26.040 --> 16:27.880
These aren't trash.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.710
They are a carbon-neutral
crafts project

16:30.710 --> 16:32.380
waiting to happen.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.460
So, what are you gonna make?

16:34.460 --> 16:37.210
Not sure. Sometimes I
go in without a plan,

16:37.210 --> 16:39.040
feel it out,
and improvise.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.290
Like jazz.
But way less boring.

16:42.290 --> 16:46.120
And... with more
washi tape.

16:49.080 --> 16:54.290
-What? -You're so creative and...
you're so smart.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.460
I can't believe you figured out
Metcalf's code.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.380
That was by accident.

16:57.380 --> 17:00.170
Ah... you're even
smart by accident.

17:10.330 --> 17:13.460
-Sorry, sometimes my palms get sweaty.
-(laughs)

17:19.210 --> 17:20.500
Hey!

17:20.500 --> 17:23.080
Bex/Bowie:
Hey!

17:23.080 --> 17:24.500
How was your day?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.170
Good.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.120
You wanna tell us
what was so good about it?

17:28.120 --> 17:29.580
No.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.380
Andi, sit down for a sec.

17:33.670 --> 17:36.290
We have somethin'
we need to tell you.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.000
What's going on?

17:48.170 --> 17:50.000
(quietly)
Just rip off the bandage.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.380
Pops and CeCe
are selling the house.

17:56.380 --> 17:59.380
What? Why?
Where are they going?

17:59.380 --> 18:02.460
Someplace smaller. And they
don't need all that space.

18:02.460 --> 18:05.670
But, what about AndiShack,
what happens to AndiShack?

18:05.670 --> 18:08.250
Don't worry, we'll find room
for your crafts supplies.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.790
AndiShack is not just the place
that I keep my glue gun.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.460
-We know that.
-No. You don't.

18:15.460 --> 18:19.420
You guys just showed up. AndiShack
has been there for my whole life!

18:19.420 --> 18:20.670
We'll figure
somethin' else out.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.210
No!
We won't.

18:23.210 --> 18:24.880
There's nothing else
like it.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.380
I wish we'd never left home.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.380

18:32.670 --> 18:34.380

Buffy:
Next, on Andi Mack...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.500
I'll take you to the arcade
this weekend.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.540
That sounds good.

19:59.540 --> 20:00.750
Cool. It's a date.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.750
I need a plus-one
for the virtual reality thingy.

20:04.750 --> 20:05.960
-Wanna come?
-Yeah, cool.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.750
I'm so glad you invited me.
Why did you?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.620
Because I don't wanna be
a third wheel.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.500
Bex:
He hurt himself, you laughed,

20:12.500 --> 20:13.790
and now you think
he's mad at you?

20:13.790 --> 20:15.620
I don't think it,
I know it.

20:15.620 --> 20:16.580
But he's denying it.

20:16.580 --> 20:17.670
We're great together.

20:17.670 --> 20:18.920
Because we're not a couple.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.040
I don't want it to be fake.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.080
I want it to be real.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.290
Is that a possibility?

20:22.290 --> 20:24.120
(drum beats,
bonk, thud)
