00:31.575 --> 00:33.677
So while conventional wisdom
says that online shopping

00:33.710 --> 00:34.711
is a contributing factor.

00:35.712 --> 00:36.713
All right guys.

00:36.747 --> 00:38.715
See you guys next week.

01:12.315 --> 01:14.450
Excuse me, hi. I'm sorry.

01:14.483 --> 01:16.653
So, I haven't been able
to find a copy of the

01:16.687 --> 01:18.889
Advanced Multi-variable
Calculus textbook

01:18.922 --> 01:20.323
and I have a friend,

01:20.356 --> 01:21.692
he said that you-

01:21.725 --> 01:25.328
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:25.361 --> 01:26.597
What was it?
What did they say?

01:26.630 --> 01:28.230
Oh, what's the special, right?

01:28.264 --> 01:29.398
Jesus

01:34.370 --> 01:35.739
Ms. Wong.

01:35.772 --> 01:37.406
Professor.

01:40.276 --> 01:41.645
Now? Now's the...

01:41.678 --> 01:43.245
Yeah cool.

01:43.279 --> 01:46.215
I think he said to say,
"What's the special", right?

01:46.248 --> 01:47.416
Its 50.

01:47.450 --> 01:48.284
Okay here.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.452
Cash.

01:55.659 --> 01:56.627
That's 40

01:56.660 --> 01:57.628
I know.

01:57.661 --> 02:00.129
I'm sorry, that's all I have.

02:01.698 --> 02:03.533
You sure?

02:05.869 --> 02:08.805
- You got your AirDrop?
- Yup. Yeah.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.376
Yeah that's me.

02:13.409 --> 02:15.244
It's the photos of the pages.

02:15.277 --> 02:16.512
Oh my God, thank you.

02:16.546 --> 02:18.514
Thank you so much. Thank you.

02:18.548 --> 02:20.249
You do well on that
anthropology test yesterday?

02:20.282 --> 02:20.917
Mm-hm.

02:20.951 --> 02:22.385
Yeah?

02:25.956 --> 02:27.289
You got pics of the test?

02:27.323 --> 02:28.357
- Yeah
- 50, right?

02:28.391 --> 02:29.860
- Yup.
- Okay, I got you.

02:29.893 --> 02:31.394
Hey, thank you again.

02:31.427 --> 02:32.663
Seriously, you have no
idea what this means to me.

02:32.696 --> 02:33.630
Mm-hm.

02:33.664 --> 02:34.564
All right I got it.

02:34.598 --> 02:35.866
You still got for Friday, right?

02:35.899 --> 02:36.967
Nope.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.335
No? What do you mean no?

02:39.368 --> 02:40.503
As of 15 minutes ago

02:40.537 --> 02:42.706
I aint a student in
this shit hole no more.

02:42.739 --> 02:44.641
You're not a student anymore?

02:44.675 --> 02:47.611
Tera, What do you mean
you're not a student anymore?

02:47.644 --> 02:49.512
Yo, if I don't
pass I don't play.

02:49.546 --> 02:50.847
Not my problem.

02:52.015 --> 02:52.949
Still want it?

02:52.983 --> 02:54.316
Yeah, of course.

02:54.350 --> 02:57.353
Can't find any of
these mid semester.

03:02.659 --> 03:04.493
Oh, um.

03:04.861 --> 03:08.832
You're like really good at our
business admin class, right?

03:08.865 --> 03:10.000
Something like that.

03:10.033 --> 03:11.702
Yeah, I was wondering

03:11.735 --> 03:15.337
if you happened to
have any of your notes

03:15.371 --> 03:17.440
from the class on you?

03:17.473 --> 03:18.875
I mean, you know, since
you're leaving and stuff,

03:18.909 --> 03:20.509
I figured I could,

03:21.444 --> 03:23.512
you know, pay you for it.

03:27.483 --> 03:28.618
Alright.

03:28.652 --> 03:30.020
Yeah?

03:30.053 --> 03:30.921
Alrighty.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.402
Tera?

03:46.435 --> 03:47.904
You have the notes?

03:53.543 --> 03:55.779
This is a game to
you aint it, Becky?

03:55.812 --> 03:57.013
Casey.

03:57.047 --> 03:57.914
Sorry.

03:58.849 --> 04:01.551
You got a bet with
your parents or what?

04:01.585 --> 04:04.487
You get a certain grade and
they get you a purse sized dog?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.989
Car?

04:06.022 --> 04:06.857
No

04:06.890 --> 04:08.357
- House?
- No.

04:08.390 --> 04:09.593
No?

04:09.626 --> 04:11.628
I mean, I may have
nice things, yes.

04:11.661 --> 04:14.731
But, I care about this
just as much as you do.

04:14.765 --> 04:16.833
Then why didn't
you take any notes?

04:19.836 --> 04:22.706
Ain't nobody trying
to hustle you.

04:26.408 --> 04:27.677
Good luck Becky.

04:29.112 --> 04:30.312
Its Casey.

04:31.413 --> 04:32.281
Bitch.

06:22.726 --> 06:25.161
- There you go.
- Thanks

06:25.195 --> 06:26.930
- Hi, just this?
- All right.

06:26.963 --> 06:29.165
Oh, can I make a
payment on Sai Kung?

06:29.199 --> 06:31.001
- Sai Kung?
- Yes please.

06:33.203 --> 06:35.839
All right, what
you guys owe 525.

06:35.872 --> 06:37.540
- Excuse me?
- 525.

06:40.977 --> 06:44.681
- I'm at the minimum.
- That is the minimum.

06:45.514 --> 06:46.917
Bro, I'm just
trying to find me a girl,

06:46.950 --> 06:47.918
you know what I'm saying?

06:47.951 --> 06:49.552
You think you're
trying to find a girl?

06:49.586 --> 06:50.620
I'm trying to find a girl.

06:50.654 --> 06:51.554
Man,

06:51.588 --> 06:52.622
five different girls every day.

06:52.656 --> 06:54.157
- Fuck outta here with that.
- Really?

06:54.190 --> 06:55.091
- What?
- Hey.

06:58.595 --> 06:59.930
Speaking of finding you a girl.

06:59.963 --> 07:01.865
Bro I got this.

07:01.898 --> 07:03.066
Time to shine.

Hey, I seen you before.

07:06.269 --> 07:09.773

07:09.806 --> 07:11.875
You know the spot

07:11.908 --> 07:14.476
By Western and Snooty Fox.

07:15.845 --> 07:17.914
- I'm Chinese.
- For real?

07:17.948 --> 07:20.617
Damn. Well you look mixed.

07:20.650 --> 07:21.818

07:27.891 --> 07:29.726
Hey, hold up.

07:29.759 --> 07:31.127
Look ma,

07:31.161 --> 07:32.829
I'm just trying
to chill with you.

07:32.862 --> 07:34.864
Hang with you, you know.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.070
Hey, hold up.

07:40.103 --> 07:41.571
Have a good day.

07:41.604 --> 07:42.706
Hey, I'm just-

07:42.739 --> 07:43.573
Oh, shit.

07:43.606 --> 07:44.240
Hey mother-

07:45.141 --> 07:46.276
Saren!

07:46.309 --> 07:47.911
Yeah, catch your
breath home boy.

07:47.944 --> 07:48.878
Shit.

07:48.912 --> 07:50.280
Yeah. You
better cool the fuck down.

07:50.313 --> 07:51.881
I'm cool.

07:51.915 --> 07:53.550
I'm cool.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.852
- Did he touch you?
- I'm cool. I'm cool.

07:55.885 --> 07:58.021
I said did he touch you?

08:00.757 --> 08:04.761
I'm so sorry bro-

08:19.642 --> 08:22.045
I'm so sorry.

08:22.078 --> 08:22.946
Lets go.

08:24.114 --> 08:26.282
Come on, we gotta go.

08:26.316 --> 08:28.585
Let's get the fuck outta here.

08:28.618 --> 08:30.020
Come on, let's go.

08:38.928 --> 08:40.196
Just a minute!

09:07.390 --> 09:10.060
How was school?

09:10.093 --> 09:11.628
It's all right.

09:13.196 --> 09:16.066
They teaching you how to get
this place to turn a profit?

09:16.099 --> 09:17.667
You got any matches?

09:17.700 --> 09:18.968
I'm just saying.

09:30.113 --> 09:31.081
Tera!

09:31.114 --> 09:32.282
Coming.

09:32.315 --> 09:33.716
Remind me
to grab more rice

09:33.750 --> 09:35.752
on the way home tonight.

09:36.853 --> 09:40.890
Its very, very important
that we not forget this time.

09:40.924 --> 09:42.325
Last time we forgot,

09:42.358 --> 09:44.294
then I had to send Saren,
and he complained so much,

09:44.327 --> 09:45.662
I might as well

09:45.695 --> 09:46.763
- tell him myself.
- She'll play it off

09:46.796 --> 09:49.899
but, auntie could barely stand
up straight this morning.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.237
Oh, I've changed
up my classes, so,

09:54.270 --> 09:55.972
I'll be around a lot more.

09:56.005 --> 09:57.173
It should help.

10:29.706 --> 10:31.941
Old ass
back brace again, huh?

10:31.975 --> 10:33.409
Like that shit's gonna help.

10:33.443 --> 10:36.746
Something's
better than nothing.

10:36.779 --> 10:39.315
Yeah,
something shitty though.

10:39.349 --> 10:40.383
I think sometimes
your brother forgets

10:40.416 --> 10:41.784
that I'm the mother,

10:41.818 --> 10:43.419
and he shouldn't be
telling me anything.

10:43.453 --> 10:44.888
What, you want
me to stop caring?

10:44.921 --> 10:45.889
Saren.

10:45.922 --> 10:47.924
Real shit though?

10:48.992 --> 10:50.193
Why don't you ask your daughter

10:50.226 --> 10:51.394
what would've happened
to her earlier today,

10:51.427 --> 10:53.463
if all of a sudden
Saren stopped caring.

10:53.496 --> 10:55.465
Saren stopped caring.

10:55.498 --> 10:58.768
Yo, that shit rhyme.
I should be a rapper.

10:58.801 --> 11:00.036
I don't know what
he's talking about, mom.

11:00.069 --> 11:02.071
Okay, play stupid then.

11:06.009 --> 11:08.077
Look, all bullshit aside,

11:09.779 --> 11:12.282
would it hurt to close this
place up one afternoon,

11:12.315 --> 11:14.083
go back to the doctor?

11:14.117 --> 11:15.251
Get this shit fixed.

11:16.819 --> 11:19.789
There's no cure for old son.

11:19.822 --> 11:22.425
Saren, Kingston's
here for you.

11:28.498 --> 11:31.367
Ain't no
cure for stupid either.

11:31.401 --> 11:33.503
- What's up bitch?
- Hey, what up, ho?

11:33.537 --> 11:34.971
- How you doing?
- I'm good, bro.

11:35.004 --> 11:35.939
Hey, check this out,

11:35.972 --> 11:37.140
I've been out all day, man.

11:37.173 --> 11:38.441
I knew it man. Your
big ass always hungry.

11:38.474 --> 11:40.076
Bro it's just a egg roll.

11:40.109 --> 11:41.211
Oh wait, wait, hold on.

11:41.244 --> 11:42.512
And some noodles.

11:42.546 --> 11:45.215
Oh wait, wait and some shrimp.

11:45.248 --> 11:46.115
You fucking greedy.

11:46.149 --> 11:48.084
Come on man.

11:48.117 --> 11:49.819
Ma.

11:49.852 --> 11:52.922
- Okay.

11:52.956 --> 11:54.224
Sup, cuz?

11:54.257 --> 11:56.326
- Hey, what up?
- Okay, that was too fast.

11:56.359 --> 11:57.293
That's not for you fatty.

11:57.327 --> 11:58.928
That's for you. Delivery.

11:58.962 --> 12:00.096
Delivery?

12:00.129 --> 12:02.465
Shit you crazy. I ain't even

12:02.498 --> 12:04.467
Y'all both goin' deliver.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.835
'Cause I got this second order

12:05.868 --> 12:07.237

taken care of ASAP.

12:07.270 --> 12:08.539
And I'm tired of
getting yelled at

12:08.572 --> 12:10.373
for people getting cold food.

12:10.406 --> 12:11.975
Hey you know ma
car broke, right?

12:12.008 --> 12:13.443
Hey, hold on, hold on.

The noodles in there, right?

12:14.944 --> 12:16.412
Shut up!

12:16.446 --> 12:19.349
How am I gonna set tables
clean and deliver on my bike?

12:19.382 --> 12:21.117
The dude next door fixed
auntie's car this morning

12:21.150 --> 12:24.220
and I'll just cover
you while you're gone.

12:24.254 --> 12:26.022
If y'all broke ass

12:26.055 --> 12:27.890
Help your cousin

12:27.924 --> 12:29.259
All right, bet.

12:29.292 --> 12:30.426

mom's car, right?

12:30.460 --> 12:32.128
Yeah, but I can't
be out too late.

12:32.161 --> 12:33.196
Get the damn car.

12:33.229 --> 12:36.032
Alright, I'll be back.

12:36.065 --> 12:38.234
Where you headed?

12:38.268 --> 12:40.303
Central and Adams, you?

12:41.437 --> 12:43.439
Around Normandy and Jefferson.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.110
Normandy and Jefferson?

12:50.947 --> 12:53.016
803 is the code to
box in the kitchen.

12:53.049 --> 12:54.083
It's where I keep my heat at.

12:54.117 --> 12:55.852
In case you need it.

12:57.387 --> 12:58.388
I'm serious.

13:00.089 --> 13:02.492
That's where Corey got popped.

13:06.362 --> 13:08.131
Be careful all right.

13:08.164 --> 13:09.866
I gotta roll, later.

13:13.336 --> 13:15.171
Fuck.

13:32.589 --> 13:35.058
Somebody order Chinese food?

13:41.331 --> 13:42.498
Yes.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.001
Did somebody order Chinese?

13:46.302 --> 13:47.203
Who ordered Chinese food?

13:47.236 --> 13:48.438
They got me all fucked up.

13:48.471 --> 13:50.440
If they think I'm gonna
pay for that shit again.

13:51.941 --> 13:53.242
I'm not paying for
the Chinese food.

13:55.078 --> 13:55.945
42.65

13:58.981 --> 14:01.117
Okay Hun, do me a favor.

14:02.653 --> 14:04.454
Take this shit to the back.

14:04.487 --> 14:06.055
I don't know who ordered
that Chinese food,

14:06.089 --> 14:08.424
but your money is back there.

14:10.293 --> 14:11.427
Back where?

14:11.461 --> 14:14.063
Behind the clothes
and the racks,

14:14.097 --> 14:14.997
back there.

14:16.265 --> 14:18.234
Nah, chica, it's 42.65.

14:20.269 --> 14:23.674
Look girl, your food
is gonna get cold.

14:23.707 --> 14:25.375
Who's gonna pay for it then, eh?

14:25.408 --> 14:27.009
Not them fools back there.

14:27.043 --> 14:29.112
So figure it out.

14:29.145 --> 14:31.648
I'm gonna get back to work now.

14:38.187 --> 14:40.056
- Question-
- I'm busy.

14:43.226 --> 14:44.961
- But-
- I'm working.

14:58.441 --> 15:00.510
Behind the shirt,
behind the rack.

15:00.544 --> 15:01.377
Fuck outta here with-

15:04.313 --> 15:05.381
And you know you're
not going to tip.

15:05.415 --> 15:07.483
So why would you do this?

15:42.385 --> 15:43.252
Excuse me?

15:46.389 --> 15:47.256
Hello.

15:49.125 --> 15:49.992
Excuse me?

15:50.727 --> 15:52.729
Yo, who ordered Chinese?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.636
Who the fuck you think you're
talking to, take out boy?

15:59.670 --> 16:02.171
Nah, fool, It's a girl.

16:02.205 --> 16:03.439
Watch out.

16:07.043 --> 16:08.144
Don't touch me.

16:08.177 --> 16:11.748
Damn man, take out
girl got heart, my boy.

16:11.782 --> 16:13.049
Sit down stupid.

16:13.082 --> 16:14.217
You don't touch a girl.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.152
What's wrong with you?

16:16.185 --> 16:18.689
I ordered it and they
call me check it out.

16:18.722 --> 16:20.289
Check out the white shoes.

16:20.323 --> 16:22.124
Check out the white shoes.

16:22.158 --> 16:24.427
They call me L.L., Call me Lalo.

16:27.263 --> 16:28.264
What do I owe you?

16:28.297 --> 16:29.533
- 42.65.
- Okay.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.703
Step into my office.

16:37.073 --> 16:37.708
Or not.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.457
You know some people
would be insulted by that.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.792
Is there a problem?

16:55.826 --> 16:57.694
No. No problem.

16:57.728 --> 16:59.462
I don't know boss,

16:59.495 --> 17:02.198
I think that tip may
have offended her.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.233
She's got bigger
balls than me, homie.

17:04.267 --> 17:06.135
She's disrespectful.

17:11.474 --> 17:13.342
I was disrespectful.

17:26.823 --> 17:28.324
Don't I know you from someplace?

17:28.357 --> 17:29.526
Doubt it.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.194
You know I did 20
years in San Quentin.

17:32.228 --> 17:34.497
I never, ever forgot a face.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.566
Hate to end the streak.

17:35.599 --> 17:36.833
Hate to end the streak?

17:39.536 --> 17:41.404
Are you sure?

17:41.437 --> 17:42.305
Certain.

17:51.748 --> 17:53.516
Hey, take out girl.

17:56.853 --> 17:59.121
I didn't catch your name.

18:03.827 --> 18:06.597
Call me what you call me.

18:06.630 --> 18:10.199
Okay, we'll keep it
professional then, huh?

18:10.232 --> 18:12.201
Thanks, take out girl.

18:12.234 --> 18:14.270
We love Chinese.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.572
You're welcome.

18:55.311 --> 18:58.514
You know, spend time together.

18:58.548 --> 19:00.516
Away from here.

19:00.550 --> 19:01.551
Holy shit.

19:02.653 --> 19:03.519
What?

19:07.791 --> 19:08.659
Okay.

19:16.566 --> 19:17.534
I'll empty trash.

19:17.567 --> 19:18.902
Mom, your back.

19:20.003 --> 19:21.538
I'm fine.

19:21.571 --> 19:25.307
This is what
Tera's talking about.

19:25.341 --> 19:27.343
You're not good.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.310
I'll do it.

19:35.351 --> 19:37.654
You gotta be shitting me.

19:37.688 --> 19:41.692
How the hell does she do
this by self every day?

19:44.895 --> 19:46.897
Yo, you need some help?

19:46.930 --> 19:48.330
No, I'm good.

19:55.739 --> 19:56.673
I got it.

20:02.779 --> 20:04.581
Thank you.

20:04.614 --> 20:05.716
But I had it.

20:08.552 --> 20:09.753
Yeah, I know.

20:11.922 --> 20:15.324
Aren't you the guy
that fixed my mom's car?

20:15.357 --> 20:16.225
Yeah.

20:17.393 --> 20:21.230
Oh, so you're like a
mechanic or something?

20:23.365 --> 20:24.233
Right?

20:25.635 --> 20:26.502
Right.

20:29.505 --> 20:31.007
Hm.

20:31.041 --> 20:31.908
Okay.

20:34.778 --> 20:38.447
Can I buy you something
to eat some time?

20:44.520 --> 20:45.387
Why?

20:47.423 --> 20:48.290
Why not?

20:49.458 --> 20:52.294
You don't think it's suspect
to a female when a janitor-

20:52.328 --> 20:53.697
- Maintenance man.

20:55.532 --> 20:57.366
When a maintenance
man come around pushing

20:57.399 --> 21:00.070
this helpful prince
charming shit?

21:00.103 --> 21:01.671
Yeah, I clean up around here.

21:01.705 --> 21:05.508
But, weren't you just
taking out the trash too?

21:11.815 --> 21:15.518
I just didn't wanna
eat alone, that's all.

21:15.552 --> 21:17.821
Okay, but, I
don't even know you.

21:17.854 --> 21:20.557
- You could be-
- I'm Nate.

21:20.590 --> 21:22.391
I clean up around here

21:22.424 --> 21:24.828
and it's my job to fix things.

21:29.431 --> 21:31.902
So you don't wanna eat alone?

21:33.537 --> 21:34.403
That's it?

21:36.505 --> 21:37.373
For now.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.677
People's intentions change.

21:40.710 --> 21:44.714
Maybe I wanna get to know
you, maybe I'm just bored.

21:44.748 --> 21:45.615
But,

21:47.684 --> 21:52.689
you won't know until you sit
down and actually talk to me.

21:53.389 --> 21:54.057
Miss?

21:55.158 --> 21:56.026
Tera.

21:57.828 --> 21:59.663
Tera.

22:00.764 --> 22:04.668
Cool, I'm gonna get back
to cleaning up around here,

22:04.701 --> 22:07.070
but let me know when you wanna

22:08.071 --> 22:10.707
take me up on a free meal.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.108
Yeah.

22:12.142 --> 22:13.743
Take care, Tera.

22:21.151 --> 22:22.052
I had it.

22:24.621 --> 22:26.355
Auntie, I'm leaving.

22:28.158 --> 22:29.960
All right girl, I am gone.

22:29.993 --> 22:32.128
I ain't trying to pay
babysitter OT money but,

22:32.162 --> 22:34.097
I restocked the fish sauce,

22:34.130 --> 22:35.665
so no need to go to store.

22:35.699 --> 22:36.900
Thank you, I totally forgot.

22:36.933 --> 22:38.602
I know, but you did
good delivering food

22:38.635 --> 22:40.770
and keeping things
tight around here.

22:40.804 --> 22:42.606
I'm gonna send yo ass
out instead of your

22:42.639 --> 22:44.473
lazy brother from now on.

22:44.506 --> 22:45.141
'Night.

22:45.175 --> 22:46.910
All right, 'night.

23:04.794 --> 23:06.630
Mom?

23:06.963 --> 23:10.767
I was thinking that I
can make more deliveries.

23:19.242 --> 23:22.946
No, I just thought that I
could be more useful that way.

23:25.849 --> 23:26.716
But.

23:28.618 --> 23:30.553
I wasted so much time

23:30.587 --> 23:32.589
learning that this place

23:33.924 --> 23:36.760
has nothing to
offer a young woman.

23:36.793 --> 23:38.795
Focus on school, please.

24:27.243 --> 24:28.845
- Ma?
- Hm?

24:28.878 --> 24:31.147
Just to it tomorrow.

24:31.181 --> 24:32.048
Go to bed.

24:33.149 --> 24:35.218
I won't take long.

24:35.251 --> 24:36.119
Go to bed.

25:43.319 --> 25:47.057
- Let me show it to a table.
- Oh, thank you.

25:48.825 --> 25:49.859
Where's Tera at?

25:49.893 --> 25:51.628
I don't know, she said she
forgot something at home.

25:51.661 --> 25:52.295
That was an hour ago.

25:52.328 --> 25:53.630
- And?
- And?

25:53.663 --> 25:55.732
I don't do this.

25:55.765 --> 25:57.067
I deliver.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.768
She's supposed to
handle all this

25:58.802 --> 26:00.336
customer service bullshit.

26:00.370 --> 26:01.638
Aw, Saren flustered
'cause he gotta

26:01.671 --> 26:03.573
do a little work today?

26:04.941 --> 26:06.342
Hey, don't make
sound like no bitch,

26:06.376 --> 26:08.078
My momma back there
working her ass off.

26:08.111 --> 26:09.212
But where's Tera at?

26:09.245 --> 26:10.180
What you want me to do?

26:10.213 --> 26:11.114
- Call her.
- I did.

26:11.147 --> 26:13.049
Call her again, Crystal.

26:13.083 --> 26:15.085
I swear to God if
momma hurts her back,

26:15.118 --> 26:16.119
trying to feed all these people.

26:16.152 --> 26:17.253
I call her.

26:19.923 --> 26:22.292
I got deliveries
that cant be late.

26:22.325 --> 26:23.927
You feel me?

26:23.960 --> 26:25.028
Get her here.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.996
- I ain't playing.
- Okay.

26:33.369 --> 26:34.604
You hungry?

26:51.788 --> 26:53.189
You got this.

27:11.474 --> 27:12.842
No, I decided not to,

27:12.876 --> 27:15.745
but he called me
like two days later.

27:15.778 --> 27:17.380
Hey, where you going?

27:18.314 --> 27:19.849
Just another one.

27:19.883 --> 27:20.750
Damn, China.

27:20.783 --> 27:22.452
That must be addicting.

27:23.887 --> 27:25.688
But I don't think so.

27:27.190 --> 27:28.057
Go.

27:29.058 --> 27:29.926
Go, go.

27:35.798 --> 27:37.167
No, don't worry.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.002
Like I was saying.

27:39.035 --> 27:40.136
Yeah.

27:54.984 --> 27:57.320
That's why I call
you stupid, stupid.

27:57.353 --> 27:58.688
Lalo please.

28:01.758 --> 28:02.992
You break my heart

28:03.026 --> 28:04.227
What, for this?

28:04.260 --> 28:06.829
- Sorry, please.
- Here, take it.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.035
Kiss the family goodbye, homes.

28:12.068 --> 28:13.336
Sorry, Lalo.

28:13.369 --> 28:14.971
No. No!

28:18.208 --> 28:19.976
Big Tiny, take him to the car.

28:20.009 --> 28:21.077
Put him in the fucking trunk.

28:24.781 --> 28:26.349
Take out girl,

28:26.382 --> 28:28.785
I didn't order any Chinese.

28:34.824 --> 28:36.426
Now hold that please.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.394
What is this?

28:39.530 --> 28:42.031
Whatever you need it to be.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.401
No disrespect but,

28:45.435 --> 28:46.836
your people

28:46.869 --> 28:48.071
They not really functional.

28:48.104 --> 28:49.239
What's wrong with them?

28:49.272 --> 28:52.242
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

28:52.275 --> 28:53.509
They noisy.

28:53.544 --> 28:54.911
Look at their clothes.

28:54.944 --> 28:56.279
Look at the ink.

28:56.312 --> 28:58.314
Look at their attitudes.

28:59.583 --> 29:01.784
It's obvious who they are.

29:01.818 --> 29:04.120
Cops see me, a
little Asian girl,

29:04.153 --> 29:05.488
they probably think
I'm going to school

29:05.521 --> 29:07.457
or a lost little tourist.

29:07.490 --> 29:08.791
Actually,

29:08.825 --> 29:09.959
it don't really
matter where I'm from

29:09.993 --> 29:12.262
'cause ain't nobody
checking for me.

29:12.295 --> 29:13.329
Where are you from?

29:13.363 --> 29:14.397
I'm from the Pueblos.

29:14.430 --> 29:15.965
Or the P's, huh?

29:15.999 --> 29:17.233
Ooh.

29:17.267 --> 29:18.801
My entire life

29:18.835 --> 29:20.537
I've never even been looked
at funny by the police,

29:20.571 --> 29:21.971
let alone searched.

29:22.005 --> 29:23.940
I'm invisible.

29:23.973 --> 29:25.141
Always have been.

29:25.174 --> 29:26.843
Shit, I walked in
here two days in a row

29:26.876 --> 29:29.312
and none of y'all know noticed.

29:29.345 --> 29:30.947
You can't buy that
type of freedom.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.815
That type of access.

29:32.849 --> 29:34.884
Not until I walked in.

29:34.917 --> 29:36.019
Look, what you put in those,

29:36.052 --> 29:36.986
that's your business.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.555
I don't ask, I don't look.

29:38.589 --> 29:39.856
Then what?

29:39.889 --> 29:42.158
Then I take it out,

29:42.191 --> 29:44.160
anywhere from LA to the IE.

29:44.193 --> 29:46.095
Inglewood?

29:46.129 --> 29:47.397
The woods too.

29:49.399 --> 29:51.568
And what's in it for
you, take out girl?

29:51.602 --> 29:53.169
I ain't greedy.

29:53.202 --> 29:54.304
8% to 10% will keep
the hot Cheetos

29:54.337 --> 29:55.572
and Aquafina on deck.

29:58.341 --> 29:59.942
- Lalo?
- Yeah?

29:59.976 --> 30:03.547
Let me kick this
puta the fuck out.

30:03.580 --> 30:04.480
Go ahead.

30:06.883 --> 30:07.884
Easy killer.

30:12.188 --> 30:13.923
Take your hat off.

30:13.956 --> 30:15.291
No.

30:15.325 --> 30:16.259
Your hat.

30:19.929 --> 30:20.597
Off.

30:21.598 --> 30:22.599
I don't see-

30:24.200 --> 30:27.303
Take your hat off and get
out ass out of my house.

30:27.337 --> 30:29.540
Take the fucking hat off.

30:38.514 --> 30:41.918
Thank you, with
your permission,

30:41.951 --> 30:43.152
come over here.

30:54.397 --> 30:56.165
Come a little closer.

31:09.112 --> 31:12.215
Move your hair so I
can see your face.

31:21.324 --> 31:23.192
What's your last name?

31:26.162 --> 31:28.998
Call me what you call me.

31:29.031 --> 31:32.135
Its your mother's
restaurant is it?

31:37.306 --> 31:38.374
I thought so.

31:40.577 --> 31:42.044
I'll think on your offer.

31:42.078 --> 31:44.947
In the meantime,
stay out of here.

31:46.048 --> 31:47.417
There's animals in here.

31:47.450 --> 31:50.587
They break from their
leash, you know.

32:08.605 --> 32:09.673
Eight?

32:23.019 --> 32:24.621
I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:26.757 --> 32:29.058
What happened?

32:29.091 --> 32:29.726
I'm okay.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.695
We hit capacity today.

32:31.728 --> 32:34.063
Auntie didn't want anyone
waiting for the food too long.

32:34.096 --> 32:36.533
I should have asked for help.

32:36.567 --> 32:38.334
She knocked the
can off the shelf,

32:38.367 --> 32:39.670
it landed into a pan,

32:39.703 --> 32:41.772
and splashed hot
grease everywhere.

32:41.805 --> 32:43.640
She's lucky it didn't
hit her in the face.

32:43.674 --> 32:45.007
We should go to the hospital.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.442
The bills from
them fixing my back

32:46.476 --> 32:47.376
still keep me up at night.

32:47.410 --> 32:48.712
You can get an infection.

32:48.745 --> 32:52.583
I have some money
saved, so let's go.

32:57.119 --> 32:58.054
I say no!

33:04.460 --> 33:06.028
I need a minute.

33:31.521 --> 33:33.790
You should have been here.

33:35.324 --> 33:37.528
But, this ain't all on you.

33:39.596 --> 33:41.765
She's always gonna
look out for us first.

33:41.798 --> 33:44.267
Never gonna change that shit.

33:46.435 --> 33:47.771
Is it worth it?

33:50.172 --> 33:51.608
Is what worth it?

33:53.409 --> 33:54.811
The side hustle.

33:58.214 --> 33:59.616
Money wise, nah,

34:00.817 --> 34:02.351
that shit's weak.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.122
But you know, it's
something to do.

34:07.423 --> 34:10.426
Keep a Lil cash in my
pocket, keep my kicks clean,

34:10.459 --> 34:11.562
maybe get yall a
little something,

34:11.595 --> 34:13.830
something on holidays, you know.

34:13.864 --> 34:14.831
That's it?

34:22.438 --> 34:25.441
You know back in the
days, when we were younger,

34:25.474 --> 34:27.711
I used to be scared
to live on this block.

34:27.744 --> 34:29.412
All the drive-by's,

34:31.314 --> 34:33.516
and seeing my homeboys die,

34:34.718 --> 34:35.752
and while all this
shit was going on,

34:35.786 --> 34:37.486
I started to think to myself,

34:37.520 --> 34:41.357
how the fuck are we
supposed to survive this?

34:42.425 --> 34:44.393
So I did what I do,

34:44.427 --> 34:45.729
earned my stripes.

34:45.762 --> 34:49.231
And the same dudes
are scared of me now.

34:51.802 --> 34:54.136
Look, I know I ain't shit.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.174
I'm probably never
gonna be rich.

34:58.207 --> 35:00.343
I'ma leave that shit up to you.

35:00.376 --> 35:02.378
You're the brains.

35:02.411 --> 35:05.481
But let a motherfucker
come fuck with my family,

35:05.514 --> 35:07.684
Bet they ass won't
come around again.

35:11.588 --> 35:12.856
Yo, I got to bounce.

35:12.889 --> 35:13.757
Later.

35:40.884 --> 35:41.752
I'm fine.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.421
Ah, excuse you.

35:46.823 --> 35:48.792
You can't be walking
in here like this.

35:48.825 --> 35:49.693
Nathan.

35:52.261 --> 35:53.630
How you doing Miss Wavy?

35:53.664 --> 35:55.231
You all right?

35:55.264 --> 35:56.667
Could be better.

35:58.869 --> 36:01.805
- What happened?
- An accident.

36:01.838 --> 36:03.740
How do you know him?

36:03.774 --> 36:08.377
You thought I took out the
trash by myself everyday?

36:08.411 --> 36:11.347
Trying to do too
much, grease burn.

36:12.949 --> 36:14.685
Been there.

36:14.718 --> 36:15.585
Just happen.

36:15.619 --> 36:17.486
Not that bad really.

36:19.321 --> 36:21.858
I can take the edge off.

36:21.892 --> 36:22.893
If you want.

36:27.864 --> 36:28.732
How?

36:31.001 --> 36:33.804
So many
hidden talents, Nathan.

36:33.837 --> 36:37.708
They say innovation
was born of desperation.

36:39.676 --> 36:41.812
They were poor too, huh?

36:42.713 --> 36:43.914
How did you learn this?

36:54.057 --> 36:56.626
I learned it from a friend.

36:58.494 --> 36:59.462
A cellmate.

37:00.831 --> 37:04.366
In Pelican Bay, we
worked in the kitchen.

37:08.872 --> 37:11.340
Give it about an hour or two.

37:11.373 --> 37:13.409
You'll feel better, okay?

37:14.310 --> 37:15.277
Thank you.

37:21.651 --> 37:24.621
Put a little more on her
before she goes to bed.

37:24.654 --> 37:26.690
How long have
you known my mom?

37:26.723 --> 37:28.058
Little while.

37:28.091 --> 37:31.260
Listening to people
can be freeing.

37:33.663 --> 37:35.331
Especially your ma.

37:35.364 --> 37:37.000
She's got stories for days.

37:37.033 --> 37:37.901
My mother?

37:37.934 --> 37:39.502
Yeah, your mother.

37:39.536 --> 37:42.371
She got stories about the
block before it went to shit.

37:42.404 --> 37:45.642
The restaurant business,
about being young,

37:45.675 --> 37:46.610
old flings,

37:48.678 --> 37:49.546
about you.

37:53.349 --> 37:54.483
I gotta get to work.

37:54.517 --> 37:56.019
Oh, how do I?

37:56.052 --> 37:59.421
It's not as bad as it looks.

37:59.455 --> 38:01.457
Potato, coconut oil, honey,

38:01.490 --> 38:02.959
and darkest tea you got.

38:02.993 --> 38:05.394
Tumeric, for the
swelling. Simple.

38:05.427 --> 38:06.530
Oh, that's it?

38:06.563 --> 38:07.496
That's it

38:10.567 --> 38:12.536
Coconut, potato oil,

38:12.569 --> 38:13.937
black tea, honey.

38:14.905 --> 38:16.540
Coconut, potato oil.

38:16.573 --> 38:17.439
Fuck.

38:32.923 --> 38:33.990
Are you okay?

38:35.091 --> 38:35.959
Yeah.

38:48.437 --> 38:50.640
I should have been there.

39:09.793 --> 39:12.629
I still should
have been there.

40:27.704 --> 40:28.872
Oh, look at you,

40:28.905 --> 40:30.240
What, y'all gonna
put down another 40?

40:30.273 --> 40:31.574
Y'all think this a horse race?

40:31.608 --> 40:34.144
No, add another zero.

40:34.177 --> 40:35.578
Ooh Okay.

40:35.612 --> 40:38.815
What, you hit the
lottery or something?

41:14.217 --> 41:15.618
Just a minute.

41:17.721 --> 41:18.989
Excuse.

41:25.895 --> 41:28.732
You're not gonna
scream, are you?

41:28.765 --> 41:30.166
Your mom.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.568
She told me you were on break.

41:31.601 --> 41:34.503
I figured you'd be
in the bathroom.

41:35.772 --> 41:37.173
Sweet, sweet lady.

41:41.845 --> 41:43.913
Finish drying your hands.

41:46.182 --> 41:48.752
Go ahead, finish drying them.

42:08.338 --> 42:09.939
I don't trust you.

42:11.174 --> 42:13.743
But Lalo, Lalo does trust you.

42:15.345 --> 42:18.048
Now, I don't know why.

42:18.081 --> 42:21.184
I've seen him make a
lot of mistakes before,

42:21.217 --> 42:22.685
watched him give

42:23.686 --> 42:28.058
opportunities to a lot
of undeserving people,

42:28.091 --> 42:29.726
reckless people,

42:29.759 --> 42:31.227
young, dumb people.

42:35.832 --> 42:37.100
So, here we are,

42:38.268 --> 42:42.172
with an opportunity
for you to fuck up.

42:42.205 --> 42:44.240
And I'm betting you will.

42:46.376 --> 42:48.244
Address is on the bag.

42:51.181 --> 42:52.982
What if I've changed my mind?

42:53.016 --> 42:54.818
I'll burn the place down.

42:54.851 --> 42:56.252
What if I keep it.

42:56.286 --> 42:57.687
Go into business for myself?

42:57.720 --> 42:59.022
I'll burn the place down.

42:59.055 --> 43:00.356
What if I go to the cops?

43:00.390 --> 43:03.927
Oh, well then I'll
burn the place down,

43:04.894 --> 43:06.596
with everyone in it.

43:16.005 --> 43:19.008
Hey, what if these
people play me?

43:19.042 --> 43:21.010
Say they never got it.

43:23.213 --> 43:24.948
I don't care.

43:24.981 --> 43:26.349
Figure it out.

43:26.382 --> 43:29.152
Matter of fact, take a picture.

43:29.185 --> 43:30.753
Take a picture?

43:30.787 --> 43:31.988
Yeah, aint that what you
kids are doing nowadays,

43:32.021 --> 43:33.223
tell them it's for social media.

43:33.256 --> 43:34.791
You want me to take a
picture of drug dealers.

43:34.824 --> 43:35.959
You want me killed?

43:35.992 --> 43:37.961
And what's wrong with taking
a picture of a happy client,

43:37.994 --> 43:40.029
buying some Chinese food?

43:41.364 --> 43:44.167
I mean that was
your idea, right?

43:47.036 --> 43:49.105
Oh, shit I almost forgot.

43:51.307 --> 43:53.143
Cheetos money, right?

43:55.845 --> 43:56.713
Right.

44:00.783 --> 44:01.651
Enjoy.

45:07.450 --> 45:09.219
Who are you?

45:09.252 --> 45:10.853
Order for Deuce.

45:24.968 --> 45:26.836
Give it here.

45:26.869 --> 45:27.837
Nah.

45:27.870 --> 45:28.738
Why?

45:29.439 --> 45:30.907
What is this, 21 questions?

45:30.940 --> 45:32.275
Where Deuce at?

45:36.479 --> 45:38.915
He said he'd be
back in 20 minutes.

45:38.948 --> 45:40.950
When he say that?

45:40.984 --> 45:42.252
Few hours ago.

45:44.153 --> 45:45.321
You know what's gonna
happen if Deuce come back

45:45.355 --> 45:47.558
and that bag aint here, right?

45:47.591 --> 45:50.059
Oh, Deuce gonna be heated.

45:52.428 --> 45:54.430
I think you best wait.

45:55.932 --> 45:59.068
Look, I'm just trying
to help you out.

46:23.393 --> 46:25.028
Look, if he ain't
here in five minutes,

46:25.061 --> 46:25.928
I'm gone.

46:27.230 --> 46:30.033
You can sit down if you want.

46:30.066 --> 46:31.134
I'll stand.

46:39.976 --> 46:43.212
She been speaking
in tongues all day.

46:43.246 --> 46:44.881
It's Tagalog.

46:44.914 --> 46:45.915
Tagalog?

46:45.948 --> 46:47.450
She's Flip.

46:47.483 --> 46:48.418
Filipino?

46:49.385 --> 46:50.920
You Filipino?

46:50.953 --> 46:52.855
You don't look like it.

46:54.257 --> 46:55.124
Nah,

46:57.661 --> 46:59.962
she too light to be Flip.

47:01.197 --> 47:02.398
Yeah, it could be those eyes,

47:02.432 --> 47:05.835
but I can't tell with
your hat too low.

47:07.270 --> 47:08.404
I'm Chinese.

47:12.942 --> 47:14.611
What's wrong with her?

47:17.146 --> 47:19.482
You new at this, ain't you.

47:20.516 --> 47:22.385
She got the super flu.

47:28.592 --> 47:31.461
You got her
medicine in that bag.

47:34.598 --> 47:36.065
Three minutes.

47:47.176 --> 47:49.546
Hey, you're better than this.

47:53.684 --> 47:54.951
So are you.

48:11.267 --> 48:13.936
I didn't tell her to do that.

48:15.539 --> 48:17.140
Fucking junkies.

48:21.177 --> 48:22.512
What the fuck?

48:22.546 --> 48:24.013
Take your shit.

48:24.046 --> 48:26.015
Hey, bitch, what is this shit?

48:29.720 --> 48:32.589
The fuck is wrong
with y'all hoes?

48:55.077 --> 48:55.746
Thank you.

48:55.779 --> 48:56.647
Take care.

49:03.754 --> 49:05.455
Hey, where's mom?

49:07.190 --> 49:08.592
She went home.

49:08.625 --> 49:09.492
Her arm.

49:10.426 --> 49:12.261
She got a ride with
Saren and his friends.

49:12.295 --> 49:13.429
Who cleaned?

49:13.463 --> 49:14.330
I did.

49:15.231 --> 49:17.066
I'm sorry. I just been so-

49:17.099 --> 49:18.367
- Its all right.

49:19.235 --> 49:20.503
- Lock up?
- Mm-hm.

49:25.508 --> 49:26.375
Hey,

49:28.645 --> 49:30.313
do you like working here?

49:30.346 --> 49:31.481
Yeah. I mean,

49:31.514 --> 49:34.585
I like being around
family and stuff.

49:35.719 --> 49:38.488
Do you really
like working here?

49:40.456 --> 49:42.225
I don't know.

49:42.258 --> 49:44.360
I love auntie,

49:44.393 --> 49:47.230
but as hard as she works,

49:47.263 --> 49:49.365
or as hard as we work,

49:49.398 --> 49:51.234
we'll never gonna make
enough to do anything

49:51.267 --> 49:55.271
but come back here and
do it again the next day.

49:59.075 --> 50:00.476
This neighborhood,

50:03.079 --> 50:07.016
can't do anything but
keep you where you're at.

50:07.818 --> 50:10.086
Anyways, I gotta go.

50:10.119 --> 50:11.555
Babysitter's waiting on me.

50:36.412 --> 50:37.548
She's right.

50:45.121 --> 50:46.188
You got this.

52:48.011 --> 52:49.412
Miss Wong?

52:49.445 --> 52:50.446
Professor.

52:57.688 --> 52:59.255
Here's your food,

52:59.288 --> 53:00.523
thank you, have a good day.

53:00.557 --> 53:01.958
Thank you.

53:13.970 --> 53:15.337
Got something for me.

53:16.606 --> 53:17.708
Not today.

53:17.741 --> 53:19.609
Lalo wants to see you.

53:21.044 --> 53:22.646
See me for what?

53:23.647 --> 53:24.513
To talk?

53:26.016 --> 53:28.317
Talk about what?

53:28.350 --> 53:29.619
He didn't say.

53:32.354 --> 53:33.422
I'm a pass.

53:34.858 --> 53:38.394
Hey, he could have
told you to come by.

53:40.030 --> 53:41.898
Instead, he asked you.

53:47.671 --> 53:49.740
I'll tell him you passed.

54:34.551 --> 54:35.417
Hey?

54:39.556 --> 54:40.389
I'm just-

54:40.422 --> 54:41.057
- I know.

54:41.091 --> 54:43.527
I know why you're here.

54:43.560 --> 54:45.061
You okay?

54:45.095 --> 54:46.462
Yeah. I mean,

54:47.531 --> 54:48.397
Yeah,

54:50.499 --> 54:51.367
I'm sorry.

54:55.071 --> 54:56.606
Sorry for what?

54:57.974 --> 55:02.579
I guess every time you
came here, I was rude to you.

55:02.612 --> 55:04.614
I guess I never realized

55:08.118 --> 55:10.821
how much we have in
common, you know?

55:10.854 --> 55:13.557
I just want to start over, man.

55:15.524 --> 55:16.392
Ximena.

55:20.964 --> 55:22.132
Hector,

55:22.165 --> 55:24.968
50 bands for Cutty
Cut in Inglewood?

55:25.001 --> 55:26.435
That's tomorrow's drop though.

55:26.468 --> 55:27.436
That's tonight.

55:27.469 --> 55:28.470
Come on, fam.

55:28.504 --> 55:29.706
We making money, man.

55:29.739 --> 55:30.974
You know it's date night, man.

55:36.847 --> 55:38.715
Give y'all a minute.

55:52.729 --> 55:54.998
You know you don't
have to be scared of me,

55:55.031 --> 55:56.933
you know that, right?

55:56.967 --> 55:58.969
I ain't scared of you.

56:00.637 --> 56:03.673
Why did you decline
my invitation?

56:03.707 --> 56:05.842
If I come running
like a dog this time,

56:05.876 --> 56:08.510
I'm gonna have to come
running every time after that.

56:08.545 --> 56:09.779
I don't work for you.

56:09.813 --> 56:11.047
I'll work with.

56:11.081 --> 56:12.649
And your people
should know that.

56:12.682 --> 56:15.051
They're not just my people.

56:15.085 --> 56:17.419
They're my blood.

56:17.453 --> 56:19.656
Nieces, nephews, cousin.

56:19.689 --> 56:20.757
Hector,

56:20.790 --> 56:23.193
he's my brother and my family.

56:23.226 --> 56:24.728
Ximena out there,

56:24.761 --> 56:26.529
that's my daughter,

56:26.563 --> 56:27.429
my heart.

56:28.464 --> 56:30.700
Something on your mind?

56:30.734 --> 56:31.601
Yeah.

56:32.836 --> 56:35.205
I don't need to know
any of this, Lalo.

56:35.238 --> 56:36.773
I don't need to know
about your family,

56:36.806 --> 56:38.742
your friends, your dog.

56:38.775 --> 56:40.844
Why are you so hostile?

56:40.877 --> 56:42.478
I'm hostile?

56:42.511 --> 56:47.183
You threatened to burn my spot
down with my family inside.

56:54.591 --> 56:55.592
I'm sorry.

56:56.726 --> 56:59.896
See, that's just
Hector being Hector.

57:01.998 --> 57:04.534
You got an address or what?

57:15.712 --> 57:16.780
You know, I got a good reason-

57:16.813 --> 57:19.082
- You got an address or nah?

57:21.517 --> 57:22.185
No.

57:42.038 --> 57:44.874
Lalo, if you put
this in my hand,

57:44.908 --> 57:46.009
I'ma take it.

57:57.754 --> 57:58.688
This is for any problems

57:58.722 --> 57:59.789
I might have caused
you or your mom.

58:20.310 --> 58:21.978
I got a question.

58:23.013 --> 58:24.814
- Yeah.
- You was beating the shit out of somebody

58:27.650 --> 58:29.686
the last time I was here.

58:31.254 --> 58:33.123
Talking about Manny?

58:34.624 --> 58:35.291
Manny.

58:37.927 --> 58:39.295
Is he family too?

58:41.197 --> 58:42.065
He was.

58:45.201 --> 58:46.069
He dead?

58:49.072 --> 58:50.673
He's dead to me.

1:00:01.077 --> 1:00:02.745
What do you want?

1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:07.150
A better question
is, what do you want?

1:00:14.390 --> 1:00:16.059
Ma?

1:00:16.092 --> 1:00:16.960
Uh huh?

1:00:18.394 --> 1:00:22.866
Can we open the
restaurant late tomorrow?

1:00:22.899 --> 1:00:24.234
- How late?
- Two?

1:00:27.003 --> 1:00:30.006
We can't afford
to open that late.

1:00:31.207 --> 1:00:32.342
It's too much.

1:00:36.179 --> 1:00:38.882
But what if we can afford it?

1:00:56.799 --> 1:00:57.800
Wait, wait.

1:01:00.870 --> 1:01:02.005
Ready?

1:01:02.038 --> 1:01:03.873
Yeah.

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:06.709
What you guys think?

1:01:06.743 --> 1:01:07.677
This is us.

1:01:08.511 --> 1:01:09.946
This is our restaurant.

1:01:09.979 --> 1:01:13.249
How can we afford this place?

1:01:13.283 --> 1:01:14.751
I promise you can,

1:01:14.784 --> 1:01:15.919
but first,

1:01:15.952 --> 1:01:17.187
this is where Crystal
signs in the guests.

1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:18.254
You mean customers?

1:01:18.288 --> 1:01:19.789
I mean, guests.

1:01:19.822 --> 1:01:21.090
Oh, we fancy now?

1:01:21.124 --> 1:01:22.392
There'll be a dress code.

1:01:22.425 --> 1:01:24.460
No wife beaters, no do rags,

1:01:24.494 --> 1:01:26.462
No staff wearing
baseball caps.

1:01:26.496 --> 1:01:28.064
Talk about that later.

1:01:28.097 --> 1:01:29.999
Oh, and there'll be a fleet
of delivery cars over there.

1:01:30.033 --> 1:01:30.867
A fleet?

1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:32.168
I mean eventually.

1:01:32.202 --> 1:01:33.336
Think about it.

1:01:33.369 --> 1:01:35.004
Who better to manage
our delivery drivers,

1:01:35.038 --> 1:01:36.706
then you, big boss?

1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:39.309
Damn right?

1:01:39.342 --> 1:01:41.244
Oh, and our kitchen is huge.

1:01:41.277 --> 1:01:42.946
Stop

1:01:46.883 --> 1:01:48.351
You deserve this.

1:01:53.389 --> 1:01:55.458
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

1:01:57.894 --> 1:02:02.298
So Melissa can explain
it way better than me.

1:02:02.332 --> 1:02:03.399
Yeah, sure.

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.135
It's called the 220 Grant.

1:02:06.169 --> 1:02:08.838
The city offers assistance
for minority business owners

1:02:08.871 --> 1:02:10.039
quite often actually.

1:02:10.073 --> 1:02:11.207
And your daughter filled
out an application,

1:02:11.241 --> 1:02:12.842
and you fit the criteria, so-

1:02:12.875 --> 1:02:14.043
- Shut the fuck up.

1:02:14.077 --> 1:02:15.378
Saren!

1:02:15.411 --> 1:02:17.013
They'll assist with
expenses for the first year

1:02:17.046 --> 1:02:19.382
and given your experience,

1:02:19.415 --> 1:02:21.184
that should be more than
enough time for the business

1:02:21.217 --> 1:02:23.219
to carry its own weight.

1:02:25.989 --> 1:02:27.890
What do you wanna do?

1:02:32.862 --> 1:02:35.131
It's whatever you want ma.

1:02:38.167 --> 1:02:39.302
Let's do it.

1:02:41.871 --> 1:02:43.273
Congratulations.

1:02:47.210 --> 1:02:49.912
Told you you were the brains.

1:02:52.482 --> 1:02:54.150
Oh, let's see the kitchen.

1:02:54.183 --> 1:02:55.451
Go see the kitchen.

1:02:55.485 --> 1:02:58.955
I'm gonna talk to Melissa
about the details.

1:03:06.630 --> 1:03:10.333
I figured a grant
seemed plausible.

1:03:10.366 --> 1:03:12.201
Yeah.

1:03:12.468 --> 1:03:13.503
You did good.

1:03:14.404 --> 1:03:17.940
I'm gonna need the
deposit by next week.

1:03:31.622 --> 1:03:32.488
Tera?

1:03:35.358 --> 1:03:37.260
They looked really happy,

1:03:38.461 --> 1:03:40.597
you're doing a good thing.

1:03:41.565 --> 1:03:42.498
Yeah.

1:03:53.343 --> 1:03:54.510
You're done?

1:03:54.545 --> 1:03:55.411
Mm-hm.

1:03:56.379 --> 1:03:58.448
You took out the trash?

1:04:20.169 --> 1:04:21.304
Rusty locks?

1:04:25.642 --> 1:04:28.378
Break in, third one this week.

1:04:31.548 --> 1:04:33.483
Be careful around here.

1:04:43.192 --> 1:04:44.327
I apologize.

1:04:47.096 --> 1:04:50.233
I was way wrong to
you the day we met.

1:04:57.574 --> 1:04:58.908
And thank you.

1:05:00.109 --> 1:05:02.345
My mom's arm is better.

1:05:02.378 --> 1:05:03.379
Much better.

1:05:12.288 --> 1:05:13.189
You hungry?

1:05:16.693 --> 1:05:17.561
Yeah.

1:05:18.695 --> 1:05:21.565
But everything around here is
probably closed already so.

1:05:21.598 --> 1:05:26.102
Well I know a really good
cook that's in your debt.

1:05:29.606 --> 1:05:31.340
I said you suck at chop sticks.

1:05:31.374 --> 1:05:32.709
I'm like looking
at the chop sticks.

1:05:32.743 --> 1:05:36.012
And was looking at the
chopsticks and I said you suck.

1:05:36.045 --> 1:05:38.214
Oh I thought you said I stink.

1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:47.356
So, if you don't
mind me asking, how-

1:05:53.029 --> 1:05:54.765
- Did I end up locked up?

1:05:54.798 --> 1:05:56.466
If it's too personal-

1:05:56.499 --> 1:05:57.366
- Nah.

1:05:59.035 --> 1:06:00.303
I got caught up,

1:06:02.472 --> 1:06:04.474
doing the same thing I guess
everybody else out here is

1:06:04.507 --> 1:06:05.374
doing.

1:06:08.311 --> 1:06:09.245
Hustling.

1:06:12.181 --> 1:06:14.317
A third of my life just.

1:06:23.594 --> 1:06:25.061
What?

1:06:25.094 --> 1:06:25.762
Nothing.

1:06:27.497 --> 1:06:29.098
You seem too good.

1:06:30.534 --> 1:06:33.402
Too smart to be
part of this shit.

1:06:35.806 --> 1:06:37.273
Freudian slip?

1:06:38.441 --> 1:06:40.142
You said, "This shit,"

1:06:40.176 --> 1:06:42.579
You could've said "That Shit."

1:06:45.281 --> 1:06:49.252
Sorry, I listen a little
too closely sometimes.

1:06:50.821 --> 1:06:52.488
It's just a slip.

1:06:54.423 --> 1:06:55.424
All right.

1:06:57.761 --> 1:07:00.329
You ever think that hustling,

1:07:00.363 --> 1:07:02.298
that sort of lifestyle,

1:07:04.568 --> 1:07:06.235
it's all around us,

1:07:07.771 --> 1:07:09.438
everybody got dirt.

1:07:11.307 --> 1:07:13.309
Everybody got an agenda.

1:07:15.278 --> 1:07:16.145
Nope.

1:07:17.446 --> 1:07:18.549
Well, I do.

1:07:18.582 --> 1:07:21.585
That's why I was
nasty to you before.

1:07:23.152 --> 1:07:25.689
I thought you had an agenda too.

1:07:27.223 --> 1:07:29.225
Could have been right.

1:07:32.295 --> 1:07:33.697
Glad I was wrong.

1:07:56.553 --> 1:07:58.722
I've met a lot of
people that seemed

1:07:58.755 --> 1:08:01.457
too smart for a lot of things.

1:08:01.490 --> 1:08:05.361
I'm certain you're too
smart for those things.

1:08:47.904 --> 1:08:50.506
You were up late last night,

1:08:51.942 --> 1:08:53.644
and you look happy.

1:08:56.278 --> 1:08:58.582
Anything I should know?

1:08:58.615 --> 1:08:59.816
I don't know.

1:09:00.951 --> 1:09:01.818
I'm good,

1:09:03.386 --> 1:09:04.721
I'm good I guess.

1:09:08.558 --> 1:09:09.392
How good?

1:09:10.292 --> 1:09:11.460
Tera?

1:09:11.494 --> 1:09:12.763
Not that good.

1:09:37.954 --> 1:09:40.557
Yo, what are you doing here?

1:09:41.858 --> 1:09:43.694
I like Chinese.

1:09:43.727 --> 1:09:44.728
We have a system.

1:09:44.761 --> 1:09:46.563
So don't you think it's
best if we stick with it?

1:09:46.596 --> 1:09:48.699
A system? Yeah, I admit.

1:09:48.732 --> 1:09:50.967
It's unprofessional to
show up unannounced.

1:09:51.001 --> 1:09:52.401
But we didn't come to
start any problems.

1:09:52.435 --> 1:09:53.904
Maybe a couple of egg rolls.

1:09:53.937 --> 1:09:55.438
Got some noodles in the bag.

1:09:55.471 --> 1:09:57.874
Just leave the bag or go,

1:09:57.908 --> 1:09:58.975
'cause I don't
need this no more.

1:10:02.344 --> 1:10:04.313
- Really?
- I was gonna text you.

1:10:04.346 --> 1:10:05.749
Hector, didn't tell you?

1:10:08.852 --> 1:10:10.319
Take out girl,

1:10:11.487 --> 1:10:14.725
do this one last one
for me and we good.

1:10:16.358 --> 1:10:17.259
We good?

1:10:18.394 --> 1:10:20.864
Man I need y'all
to leave right now.

1:10:20.897 --> 1:10:22.032
Like now.

1:10:22.065 --> 1:10:23.033
You want us to go?

1:10:23.066 --> 1:10:24.333
Yes.

1:10:24.366 --> 1:10:27.871
You know every social visit
is not all about business.

1:10:27.904 --> 1:10:29.039
What do you want?

1:10:29.072 --> 1:10:31.474
Hospitality would be nice.

1:10:31.507 --> 1:10:33.509
The same hospitality
that I gave you.

1:10:33.543 --> 1:10:34.978
When you showed
up at my doorstep,

1:10:35.011 --> 1:10:35.879
uninvited,

1:10:35.912 --> 1:10:36.913
unannounced.

1:10:37.814 --> 1:10:39.415
Here you go,

1:10:39.448 --> 1:10:40.817
what would you like sir?

1:10:40.851 --> 1:10:41.885
See, I don't need that.

1:10:41.918 --> 1:10:42.919
I know exactly what I want.

1:10:42.953 --> 1:10:44.621
I want you to tell the cook,

1:10:44.654 --> 1:10:46.556
just like this,

1:10:46.590 --> 1:10:49.325
peppered steak, uncooked onions,

1:10:50.093 --> 1:10:51.928
most importantly,

1:10:51.962 --> 1:10:54.698
I want my orange
juice with extra-

1:10:57.433 --> 1:10:58.869
No ice.

1:10:58.902 --> 1:11:03.006
You seen this place, we
don't got time for that.

1:11:04.741 --> 1:11:05.909
Listen to me.

1:11:07.510 --> 1:11:11.648
You tell the cook, that Lalo
wants it exactly like that.

1:11:11.681 --> 1:11:12.515
Peppered steak-

1:11:12.549 --> 1:11:13.683
- I got you.

1:11:13.717 --> 1:11:16.920
- Uncooked onions-
- Do I look slow to you?

1:11:16.953 --> 1:11:18.354
She's feisty.

1:11:24.761 --> 1:11:27.898
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm
gonna have to call you back.

1:11:27.931 --> 1:11:29.800
- Mom?
- Yeah.

1:11:29.833 --> 1:11:31.802
I need peppered steak

1:11:31.835 --> 1:11:34.070
with uncooked onions

1:11:34.104 --> 1:11:37.406
and orange juice
with extra sugar,

1:11:37.439 --> 1:11:38.307
no ice.

1:11:41.711 --> 1:11:43.312
Mom, What's wrong?

1:11:46.716 --> 1:11:47.584
Mom?

1:11:51.588 --> 1:11:52.454
Mom,

1:11:53.522 --> 1:11:54.658
what's going on?

1:11:54.691 --> 1:11:55.559
Mom?

1:12:08.004 --> 1:12:08.872
Wavy.

1:12:13.009 --> 1:12:15.879
Every time yu made at
me, you speak Spanish.

1:12:15.912 --> 1:12:17.446
But you knew I'd be
around here one day.

1:12:17.479 --> 1:12:18.815
And you knew why.

1:12:20.050 --> 1:12:23.452
You don't wanna
get Hector upset.

1:12:23.485 --> 1:12:25.021
Don't cause a scene.

1:12:25.989 --> 1:12:27.624
Let's just sit down

1:12:27.657 --> 1:12:28.792
and sort this out.

1:12:28.825 --> 1:12:29.693
No.

1:12:30.660 --> 1:12:32.596
I'd like you to leave.

1:12:32.629 --> 1:12:33.997
I'll leave when you
give me a few answers.

1:12:34.030 --> 1:12:35.397
Easy as that.

1:12:35.431 --> 1:12:36.132
You wanna talk, let's talk.

1:12:36.166 --> 1:12:37.399
But leave my mom out of this.

1:12:37.433 --> 1:12:38.835
Or what?

1:12:38.869 --> 1:12:40.003
I'm gonna call the cops

1:12:40.036 --> 1:12:41.838
And tell them
what? Everything?

1:12:41.872 --> 1:12:43.540
Good choice.

1:12:43.573 --> 1:12:44.674
You know you're
fearless, aren't you?

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:46.142
I see it in you.

1:12:46.176 --> 1:12:48.945
You can't teach
courage like that.

1:12:48.979 --> 1:12:51.715
You guys both know why?

1:12:51.748 --> 1:12:52.883
It's genetics.

1:12:55.652 --> 1:12:57.787
I'm not gonna leave you with-

1:12:57.821 --> 1:13:01.625
- You wanna be careful
because I know that look.

1:13:01.658 --> 1:13:03.159
Look I'm just presenting
a united front.

1:13:03.193 --> 1:13:05.528
I'm on your side, Wavy.

1:13:05.562 --> 1:13:07.097
You guys okay over there?

1:13:07.130 --> 1:13:08.965
Fine.

1:13:11.534 --> 1:13:13.069
This won't take long.

1:13:14.671 --> 1:13:15.772
Yo, Hector.

1:13:15.805 --> 1:13:16.806
Let her sit.

1:13:18.507 --> 1:13:21.044
Wavy, why don't you have a seat?

1:13:34.591 --> 1:13:35.959
How are you Wavy?

1:13:37.527 --> 1:13:38.194
Fine.

1:13:39.963 --> 1:13:41.698
How old is she?

1:13:41.731 --> 1:13:42.966
She's 21.

1:13:42.999 --> 1:13:46.736
21. You waited
21 years to tell me.

1:13:48.004 --> 1:13:49.105
I gotta know.

1:13:54.510 --> 1:13:55.178
Okay.

1:13:59.249 --> 1:14:00.917
Okay, Wavy.

1:14:00.951 --> 1:14:02.652
This bag belongs to Tera.

1:14:02.686 --> 1:14:04.587
You make sure she
gets it, all right.

1:14:04.621 --> 1:14:05.255
Okay.

1:14:05.288 --> 1:14:07.023
21 years.

1:14:59.909 --> 1:15:02.245
He left that for you.

1:15:02.278 --> 1:15:03.813
I didn't open it.

1:15:05.648 --> 1:15:08.651
I want you to tell
me what's inside.

1:15:13.323 --> 1:15:14.657
I'll tell you everything.

1:15:14.691 --> 1:15:17.727
But first you tell me what you
were talking about out there.

1:15:17.761 --> 1:15:19.095
No.

1:15:19.129 --> 1:15:20.330
You sent me back here, right?

1:15:20.363 --> 1:15:23.033
I know you were talking
about me out there.

1:15:23.066 --> 1:15:24.200
What's inside the bag?

1:15:24.234 --> 1:15:25.902
When did you
learn Spanish, Mom?

1:15:25.935 --> 1:15:27.203
Answer my question, Tera!

1:15:27.237 --> 1:15:28.671
I don't know!

1:15:30.206 --> 1:15:31.274
I don't know.

1:15:35.812 --> 1:15:37.981
I don't know. And I don't care.

1:15:38.014 --> 1:15:39.549
You don't know?

1:15:44.387 --> 1:15:45.789
I never looked.

1:15:45.822 --> 1:15:48.324
What do you think was inside?

1:15:51.194 --> 1:15:52.195
A way out.

1:15:57.233 --> 1:15:59.569
Doesn't matter how, huh?

1:16:04.007 --> 1:16:04.874
No.

1:16:12.182 --> 1:16:14.884
But why was he out there, Mom?

1:16:20.990 --> 1:16:24.360
I had a life
before you were here,

1:16:24.394 --> 1:16:27.130
and that's all you need to know.

1:16:31.701 --> 1:16:32.368
Crystal?

1:16:36.172 --> 1:16:37.740
Did you hear him?

1:16:43.913 --> 1:16:44.781
Crystal?

1:16:49.419 --> 1:16:51.020
That's your dad.

1:17:16.179 --> 1:17:18.781
What is she doing out there?

1:17:26.156 --> 1:17:27.891
Cleaning, working.

1:17:35.932 --> 1:17:38.001
Guess I'll do the same.

1:17:39.002 --> 1:17:39.869
Tera.

1:17:42.739 --> 1:17:44.274
Where are you going?

1:18:36.893 --> 1:18:37.827
A gunman shoots

1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:39.128
a 15 year old boy dead

1:18:39.162 --> 1:18:41.064
in front of her sister.

1:18:41.097 --> 1:18:42.232
He was leaving his
apartment building,

1:18:42.265 --> 1:18:43.499
to get something to eat.

1:18:43.534 --> 1:18:44.901
Shit!

1:18:44.934 --> 1:18:46.336
At 5 p.m. on Friday

1:18:46.369 --> 1:18:49.505
when he was confronted in
the lobby by the gunman.

1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:51.007
He had been shot in the face-

1:18:59.849 --> 1:19:02.452
You familiar with
this area, ma'am?

1:19:02.485 --> 1:19:04.020
No, not really.

1:19:05.822 --> 1:19:07.523
Have you had anything
to drink tonight?

1:19:07.558 --> 1:19:09.092
No sir.

1:19:09.125 --> 1:19:10.026
You sure?

1:19:10.059 --> 1:19:12.161
Your eyes are bloodshot red.

1:19:12.195 --> 1:19:14.030
Nope. Nothing.

1:19:14.063 --> 1:19:15.898
I just,

1:19:16.099 --> 1:19:19.536
I just had a really
stressful day.

1:19:19.570 --> 1:19:21.971
Where you headed?

1:19:22.005 --> 1:19:23.406
57th and Central.

1:19:23.439 --> 1:19:25.008
I think that's like
right off Slawson.

1:19:25.041 --> 1:19:25.908
I know.

1:19:27.578 --> 1:19:29.812
What's in that red bag?

1:19:33.149 --> 1:19:34.884
Chicken Chow Mien.

1:19:36.853 --> 1:19:39.822
Officer, did I not signal?

1:19:39.856 --> 1:19:43.026
Your registration is expired.

1:19:43.059 --> 1:19:44.360
My mom, she-

1:19:44.394 --> 1:19:47.030
- Plus gotta get your
side-view repaired too.

1:19:47.063 --> 1:19:48.164
Absolutely.

1:19:49.299 --> 1:19:50.433
I don't smell anything.

1:19:50.466 --> 1:19:51.301
I'm sorry.

1:19:51.334 --> 1:19:52.168
The food.

1:19:52.201 --> 1:19:54.137
I don't smell anything.

1:19:55.905 --> 1:19:59.042
Oh, it probably
got cold in traffic.

1:20:07.083 --> 1:20:09.185
I need you to step
out of the car, ma'am.

1:20:09.218 --> 1:20:10.420
Officer I just-

1:20:10.453 --> 1:20:14.123
- I asked you to step
out of the car, ma'am.

1:20:14.157 --> 1:20:15.391
Hands!

1:20:15.425 --> 1:20:18.562
I was just reaching
for my seatbelt.

1:20:20.063 --> 1:20:20.930
Come on.

1:20:23.333 --> 1:20:24.467
All units stand by.

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:25.569
I said step out
of the vehicle.

1:20:25.602 --> 1:20:26.537
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:20:26.570 --> 1:20:28.071
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:20:28.104 --> 1:20:29.405
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:20:29.439 --> 1:20:31.341
Hey, we gotta go.

1:20:31.374 --> 1:20:33.209
We gotta roll now.

1:20:33.242 --> 1:20:37.313
Wherever you were
headed, just go home.

1:20:56.232 --> 1:20:58.201
Answer the Goddamn door.

1:21:03.272 --> 1:21:05.074
Who the fuck are you?

1:21:05.108 --> 1:21:06.476
You Courtney?

1:21:06.509 --> 1:21:09.178
That's that, you
better get the goddam door.

1:21:09.212 --> 1:21:11.114
Are you Lalo's bitch?

1:21:14.283 --> 1:21:15.518
I'm nobody's bitch.

1:21:15.552 --> 1:21:16.953
Especially him.

1:21:21.190 --> 1:21:22.925
Shut, the fuck up.

1:21:27.564 --> 1:21:29.265
You're late.

1:21:29.298 --> 1:21:31.234
You gonna be fucked up.

1:21:31.267 --> 1:21:32.468
You Courtney?

1:21:33.436 --> 1:21:35.037
You got my shit?

1:21:44.447 --> 1:21:45.448
Thank you.

1:21:48.184 --> 1:21:49.152
Hey I gotta get a receipt-

1:21:52.355 --> 1:21:53.189
Hey?

1:21:55.124 --> 1:21:56.025
Excuse?

1:21:56.058 --> 1:21:56.693
What you gonna do?

1:21:56.727 --> 1:21:58.327
What you gonna do?

1:22:02.231 --> 1:22:04.333
Sick of this shit, man.

1:22:04.367 --> 1:22:06.202
Tera?

1:22:23.119 --> 1:22:25.188
You moving Lalo's shit?

1:22:34.030 --> 1:22:35.364
Look at me, Tera.

1:22:41.070 --> 1:22:42.472
You letting them use you?

1:22:56.452 --> 1:22:57.320
Saren?

1:23:00.356 --> 1:23:01.357
Saren?

1:23:01.390 --> 1:23:02.258
What?

1:23:04.628 --> 1:23:08.331
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

1:23:08.364 --> 1:23:09.700
I know what Lalo's about.

1:23:09.733 --> 1:23:11.100
Look I-

1:23:11.133 --> 1:23:12.736
- You know what, don't
say shit else to me.

1:23:12.769 --> 1:23:15.137
Now that I know it's you,

1:23:15.171 --> 1:23:17.608
you're a fucking fake for real.

1:23:18.307 --> 1:23:21.110
The new restaurant, the grant.

1:23:22.813 --> 1:23:25.014
Shit was all a lie, huh?

1:23:26.315 --> 1:23:27.283
Fucking knew it.

1:23:27.316 --> 1:23:28.685
I'm sorry.

1:23:28.719 --> 1:23:30.186
You're moving that shit
through ma's restaurant?

1:23:30.219 --> 1:23:31.087
Are you?

1:23:35.491 --> 1:23:36.359
Wow.

1:23:38.361 --> 1:23:40.531
You know, you one stupid bitch.

1:23:40.564 --> 1:23:41.698
You know that?

1:23:43.299 --> 1:23:44.166
Why?

1:23:45.401 --> 1:23:48.404
I'm a stupid bitch,
right, tell me why.

1:23:48.437 --> 1:23:50.106
Because we could lose
everything, that's why.

1:23:50.139 --> 1:23:51.507
And we couldn't
because of you,

1:23:51.542 --> 1:23:52.676
because of the shit you do?

1:23:52.709 --> 1:23:54.545
you could catch
a case too Saren,

1:23:54.578 --> 1:23:56.145
You don't think the
police gonna see

1:23:56.178 --> 1:23:57.781
that you spend 90% of the
time at the restaurant.

1:23:57.814 --> 1:24:00.149
You guilty by association.

1:24:01.150 --> 1:24:02.385
Shit if I sit in jail,

1:24:02.418 --> 1:24:06.757
It might as well be for
something that I did.

1:24:06.790 --> 1:24:10.493
But you didn't think
about that though, huh?

1:24:10.527 --> 1:24:12.428
Yet I'm the stupid bitch.

1:24:12.461 --> 1:24:14.698
And mom knows what you do too.

1:24:14.731 --> 1:24:16.533
She only acts stupid while
you walk back and forth

1:24:16.567 --> 1:24:19.402
to that Dumbo box
in the kitchen.

1:24:19.435 --> 1:24:20.704
I have been doing this for what?

1:24:20.737 --> 1:24:21.638
A few months?

1:24:21.672 --> 1:24:23.072
You, few years?

1:24:26.610 --> 1:24:27.778
But I'm making the type of bread

1:24:27.811 --> 1:24:30.446
that's gonna give
ma a better life.

1:24:30.479 --> 1:24:32.749
At least better than
you could ever give her.

1:24:32.783 --> 1:24:36.519
You're not mad at me for
lying or for what I did.

1:24:36.553 --> 1:24:38.154
You mad 'cause I
took your one thing

1:24:38.187 --> 1:24:39.255
and I did it better than you.

1:24:39.288 --> 1:24:40.156
What?

1:24:45.494 --> 1:24:46.730
Fuck you, Tera.

1:24:48.532 --> 1:24:51.200
You think you know it all, huh.

1:24:51.233 --> 1:24:53.235
You got no fucking idea.

1:24:55.739 --> 1:24:57.373
What I'm mad about.

1:25:00.209 --> 1:25:01.344
What I'm mad about
is you made me think

1:25:01.377 --> 1:25:04.881
that I would have to
do this shit no more,

1:25:04.915 --> 1:25:09.518
that I don't have to run
the streets no more, Tera.

1:25:09.553 --> 1:25:11.520
You gave us hope.

1:25:12.923 --> 1:25:15.659
You gave me and ma hope.

1:25:15.692 --> 1:25:19.428
And you ripped that shit
away by lying to us.

1:25:20.396 --> 1:25:22.398
Sorry. I just thought.

1:25:31.474 --> 1:25:32.743
I learn fast though.

1:25:32.776 --> 1:25:35.879
I learn real fast,
believe that shit.

1:25:35.912 --> 1:25:38.815
And Lalo's ass gonna learn
too, believe that shit.

1:25:38.849 --> 1:25:40.684
That's on my hood homie.

1:25:40.717 --> 1:25:41.652
They don't know me,

1:25:41.685 --> 1:25:44.453
I'm gonna fuck his ass up.

1:26:44.346 --> 1:26:46.449
Do a full shift today?

1:26:46.482 --> 1:26:47.349
Yeah.

1:26:51.387 --> 1:26:52.756
Look tired too.

1:26:56.526 --> 1:26:58.862
You don't look tired to me.

1:26:59.863 --> 1:27:00.731
Oh yeah.

1:27:02.599 --> 1:27:03.533
How I look?

1:27:07.571 --> 1:27:10.741
Like I did the
day I was sentenced.

1:27:27.758 --> 1:27:28.759
Thank you.

1:27:34.396 --> 1:27:35.264
Yeah.

1:27:45.809 --> 1:27:46.676
Hey,

1:27:51.815 --> 1:27:53.817
I gotta get outta here.

1:28:02.959 --> 1:28:03.827
I got you.

1:28:47.170 --> 1:28:49.573
Saren, the piece is missing.

1:28:49.606 --> 1:28:51.575
Call me when you get
this, I'm worried.
