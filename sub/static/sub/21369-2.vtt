00:06.380 --> 00:09.120
Raven: Raven's Home was filmed in
front of a live studio audience.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.250
Ooh-oo-hoo, ooh-oo-hoo,
ooh-oo-hoo!

00:12.250 --> 00:14.880
(both laugh)

00:14.880 --> 00:16.960
Man, it's so awesome
sharin' a room with you!

00:16.960 --> 00:19.290
We're like brothers who live
with each other's mothers.

00:19.290 --> 00:22.080
More like dudes who didn't
know each other that well,

00:22.080 --> 00:24.420
but their moms moved in together
to save money.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.670
I like the way I said it
'cause it rhymed.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.250
All right, check it out.
I'm about to dunk.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.790
Too bad we don't
have a trampoline.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.500
That's what I had
in my old bedroom.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.880
Trampoline?
What are you talkin' about?

00:34.880 --> 00:37.540
Oh, it's like a sheet connected
by a spring to a frame--

00:37.540 --> 00:41.000
Levi, I know
what a trampoline is.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.170
You had one in your room?

00:42.170 --> 00:45.960
It was awesome.
I miss that room.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.540
Well... we don't need
a trampoline

00:48.540 --> 00:50.120
to make this room awesome!

00:50.120 --> 00:52.120
Toss me the ball,
I'm goin' off the bed this time.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.670
Dunk it like a bounce!

00:55.670 --> 00:58.210
Aah! (thuds)

00:58.210 --> 00:59.790
Nothin' but floor!

01:01.380 --> 01:03.920
Uh, why aren't y'all
gettin' ready for school?

01:03.920 --> 01:05.750
I was showin' Levi
how to dunk.

01:05.750 --> 01:08.000
(laughs) Now you know
the only person in this house

01:08.000 --> 01:10.210
who's gonna show Levi
how to dunk is me.

01:10.210 --> 01:12.790
Watch out! Lemme take you
to flight school, chumps!

01:12.790 --> 01:17.330
Oh! Oh! Oh! Catch it!
Spin it! Kiss it!

01:17.330 --> 01:18.330
Huh! Hah!

01:18.330 --> 01:19.330
Ooh!

01:20.580 --> 01:22.250

01:22.250 --> 01:27.120

Mom, do you know
where my black boots are?

02:21.960 --> 02:23.080
Uh, did you check
the bookshelf?

02:23.080 --> 02:24.460
No, that's just
for my shirts and pants.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.460
-What about the China cabinet?
-No, that's for my socks,

02:26.460 --> 02:28.080
underwear, and large
serving spoons.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.330
Not a lotta places
to put my stuff.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.170
Yeah, reminds me
of that weekend

02:33.170 --> 02:34.790
we spent
in that submarine,

02:34.790 --> 02:35.830
-right, Rae?
-Yeah!

02:35.830 --> 02:37.580
(laughs)
Yeah!

02:37.580 --> 02:39.620
Why did you spend the weekend
on a submarine?

02:39.620 --> 02:42.330
'Cause there's some things
you can't do on a boat!

02:42.330 --> 02:45.250
(Chelsea and Raven laugh)

02:48.830 --> 02:50.000
-Mom?
-Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.210
Uh, I've been thinking about
our living situation.

02:52.210 --> 02:55.170
Me too. Me too, Nia,
and let me tell you,

02:55.170 --> 02:57.920
I have not had this
much fun in so long.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.420
I love having Chelsea and Levi

02:59.420 --> 03:00.880
live here,
right?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.040
Yeah! Yeah, me too.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.170
Yeah, could you
do me a favor

03:04.170 --> 03:05.380
and check on your
brother and Levi?

03:05.380 --> 03:06.250
I think your dad's gonna be here

03:06.250 --> 03:07.500
to pick you up for
school any minute.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.080
(doorbell rings)

03:10.290 --> 03:12.170
Oh, hey, Devon!

03:14.750 --> 03:16.580
Hey, Chels.
Kids ready for school?

03:16.580 --> 03:17.750
Yeah. Think so.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.000
Uh, you didn't have
to come up here.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.040
I would've sent them down.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.120
Now can't I just stop by

03:21.120 --> 03:23.210
to say hello
to my lovely ex-wife?

03:23.210 --> 03:24.880
Mm-hm.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.750
You need me to tie
your tie, don't you?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.380
-Yes! Yes.
-(laughs) Yes.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.620
Come here.
Okay, spill it.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.250
Why you
all fancy and spiffy?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.880
Well, I have a big interview

03:37.880 --> 03:39.330
today with the head
of the network.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.500
And it's a good chance

03:40.500 --> 03:41.620
they're finally
gonna offer me

03:41.620 --> 03:43.040
that weekday weatherman slot.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.620
(gasp)
Like how good of a chance,

03:45.620 --> 03:48.420
like-- like what percentage?

03:48.420 --> 03:51.330
Chels, Chels, come here. He's about
to do it. He's about to do it.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.750
Ooh, ooh.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.580
Well, Raven, today's forecast

03:54.580 --> 03:56.540
calls for
a high-pressure situation,

03:56.540 --> 03:59.000
-but if I keep a cool front...
-Mm-hm.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.460
...I'd say I have an 85 to 90%
chance of blowin' their minds.

04:05.380 --> 04:08.250
I don't care if we're
divorced, that is hot.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.080
Kids:
Eww!

04:13.120 --> 04:16.250
(laughs)
Hey, guys, you ready to go?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.710
Yeah, just a second.

04:17.710 --> 04:19.210
Hey, Daddy.

04:19.210 --> 04:20.880
-Hey, Aunt Chelsea?
-Yeah?

04:20.880 --> 04:23.250
That trampoline Levi
had in his room...

04:23.250 --> 04:24.580
how big was it?

04:24.580 --> 04:26.830
Well, not that big.
It couldn't have been.

04:26.830 --> 04:29.790
It had to fit between the pinball
machine and the half-pipe.

04:31.790 --> 04:33.750
No wonder he misses
his old room.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.080
Movin' is the only option.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.460
That's disappointing.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.460
Levi's gonna move!

04:48.460 --> 04:49.880
What are you talkin' about?

04:49.880 --> 04:52.880
Oh, heh, it's just a song
I came up with.

04:52.880 --> 04:57.290
L--L-- Levi's gonna move...
that booty.

04:57.290 --> 05:00.710
♪ Move that booty!
Move, move, that booty ♪

05:00.710 --> 05:02.540
Stop talkin' about Levi's booty
and get to school.

05:02.540 --> 05:03.790
Okay.

05:05.210 --> 05:06.920
Both:
That's your son!

05:09.210 --> 05:10.290
You comin', Nia?

05:10.290 --> 05:11.290
I'm just waiting for Tess.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.790
So? How'd it go
when you told your ma

05:15.790 --> 05:17.540
you didn't wanna sleep
on the couch anymore?

05:17.540 --> 05:19.790
-I didn't tell her.
-You gotta say something!

05:19.790 --> 05:23.380
I'm not like you, Tess. I can't just
say, "Yo, I got mad love for you, Ma,

05:23.380 --> 05:25.120
but I ain't
about that couch life."

05:26.330 --> 05:29.500
Yo, I don't sound like that.
I got mad love for you, Mia,

05:29.500 --> 05:31.250
but I ain't
about that impression.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.620
She's just so happy.
I don't know what to do.

05:35.620 --> 05:40.920
Every night I sleep on a cushion that spent
all day absorbing my brother's butt sweat.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.500
And you sleep
with your mouth open!

05:44.170 --> 05:45.460
Do you have any gum?

05:45.460 --> 05:47.250
Yeah, but it's
butt sweat flavored.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.540
What is wrong with you?

05:56.170 --> 05:58.500
Mom, you're home.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

05:58.500 --> 06:01.960
Sure. Sure, Booker, yeah, I don't
need five minutes to unwind

06:01.960 --> 06:03.580
after I had a long day
at work.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.080
That's good,
'cause this is important.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.420
I'm worried that Levi
doesn't like our room,

06:08.420 --> 06:11.830
so I thought I'd get him some stuff
to make him feel more at home.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.120
Ohh, aren't you sweet?

06:14.120 --> 06:18.120
Okay, what were you thinkin'? Like,
uh, ooh, a bean bag? No, no, no.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.920
A multi-colored light bulb?

06:21.170 --> 06:25.750
Actually, I was thinking...
a Thunder Bounce trampoline!

06:27.380 --> 06:29.580
What I tell you about thinking?
It don't work for you.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.580
But it's on sale,
same-day delivery!

06:33.580 --> 06:34.830
Free installation!

06:34.830 --> 06:36.830
How are these words
not convincing you?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.420
They're convincing me!

06:39.540 --> 06:40.670
I'm sorry, are you
still talking?

06:40.670 --> 06:42.170
'Cause I stopped listening.

06:49.580 --> 06:52.620
-(dramatic music playing)
-(heart beating)

07:15.210 --> 07:16.380
(clicks)

07:17.460 --> 07:18.710
(dings)

07:20.250 --> 07:22.960
Whoa-ho-ho-ho, I'm never
felt more alive!

07:22.960 --> 07:26.500
(laughing)

07:26.500 --> 07:28.830
-(bedroom door slams shut)
-(door opens)

07:28.830 --> 07:30.580
Hey, Rae, I'm home!

07:30.580 --> 07:33.000
Oh hey, Chels.
Look at you doin' laundry!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.250
Yeah, I thought
I'd help out.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.920
Okay, that's cute, that's cute.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.000
Um, this isn't our laundry.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.170
How do you know?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.620
Well, there's no one in this
house named "Swiz Money."

07:45.960 --> 07:49.710
Man, I gotta go back
to the laundry room!

07:49.710 --> 07:51.960
And fast. From the size
of these underpants,

07:51.960 --> 07:55.290
Swiz Money is not someone you
oughta mess with. Am I right?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.290
(knocking on door)

08:01.290 --> 08:03.000
Booker, you in there?

08:04.290 --> 08:06.290
No! You can't come in.

08:06.290 --> 08:07.460
Why?

08:07.460 --> 08:09.170
I... just farted.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.330
Well, can you come out here?

08:14.710 --> 08:16.790
All right, what do you want?
Make it quick.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.920
Well, I just wanted
to talk to you...

08:18.920 --> 08:20.670
about Aunt Chelsea
and Levi living here.

08:20.670 --> 08:24.120
-What about it? -Well, you don't think
it's gonna be like this forever,

08:24.120 --> 08:26.830
-do you? -Man, I hope so.
I love it.

08:26.830 --> 08:30.080
Levi loves it.
Un-- Unless he doesn't love it.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.080
-Did he say something to you?
-No! No.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.330
I just need some advice.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.460
My advice?
But I always come to you.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.750
Just do what you would
tell me to do.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.120
Hey! That was
pretty good advice!

08:42.120 --> 08:43.790
Glad I could help!

08:43.790 --> 08:46.540
-No, I just need some--
-(door closes)

08:46.540 --> 08:47.830
Good talk.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.290
Thanks for bringing this
up the fire escape, buddy.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.170
Levi's gonna love it!

08:58.540 --> 09:01.670
Huh? Huh-huh?
Now how great is this?

09:01.670 --> 09:03.920
I can't believe your mom
let you get it!

09:03.920 --> 09:09.380
Uh-- Yeah. My mom just
wants you to feel at home.

09:09.380 --> 09:13.120
If you thanked my mom,
she'd say, "Don't mention it,"

09:13.120 --> 09:14.080
so don't.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.830
Especially to my... mom.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.080
Why do you keep
saying "mom" like that?

09:22.080 --> 09:24.460
'Cause she hates it
when I call her Raven.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.170
Come on, let's bounce.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.170
Both:
One! Two! Three! Four!

09:32.170 --> 09:35.420
6,042! 6,043!

09:37.040 --> 09:38.080
Why'd you stop?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.540
I got tramp cramp!

09:41.210 --> 09:44.000
You're probably
just dehydrated.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.750
What was your favorite drink
at your old house?

09:45.750 --> 09:48.830
Well, I did enjoy
a sparkling pineapple juice.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.330
One sparklin' pineapple juice
comin' up.

09:53.330 --> 09:57.250
Sparklin' pineapple juice. It's the
fanciest thing I've ever heard!

10:01.540 --> 10:03.830
-Hey, baby, how's it goin'? -It'd
be goin' a whole lot better

10:03.830 --> 10:05.710
if we had some sparklin'
pineapple juice.

10:05.710 --> 10:08.580
Sparklin' pineapple juice?
This ain't no country club.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.710
No. No. Almond milk?

10:18.710 --> 10:20.380
How do you milk an almond?

10:22.420 --> 10:25.330
Uh, Booker,
what are you doing?

10:25.330 --> 10:29.420
Freaking out. I thought Levi and Aunt
Chelsea living here was going great,

10:29.420 --> 10:30.830
-but maybe it's not.
-Yes! Yes, exactly.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.250
This is what I was trying
to talk to you about.

10:34.250 --> 10:37.170
I mean, sometimes you wish things
could go back to the way they were.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.380
Is it so wrong
to want a little privacy?

10:40.380 --> 10:43.040
Privacy?
You think Levi wants privacy?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.120
-I was talking about me.
-Why do you need privacy?

10:45.120 --> 10:48.120
Nia! Nia!
Where do you keep your bras?

10:50.330 --> 10:53.040
That!
That's why I need privacy.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.380
That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.960
I know. I know.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.380
She's so adorable. Okay, so she
wanted me to buy her some,

11:02.380 --> 11:04.880
'cause she went to middle school and she
wanted to be like all the big girls,

11:04.880 --> 11:06.380
but it's like a head band,
it's like...

11:06.380 --> 11:10.120
(women laughing)

11:12.210 --> 11:15.330
-Well, that is adorable!
-I know.

11:15.330 --> 11:17.250
It's so small,
like I can just--

11:17.250 --> 11:19.080
Hey, Mom!

11:20.120 --> 11:23.170
I just-- I just want
to put it on!

11:23.170 --> 11:25.880
-It's so c--
-We're done talking about this!

11:25.880 --> 11:27.040
What?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.250
Hey, Booker.
Where'd you go?

11:31.250 --> 11:33.250
Wait. What is that?

11:33.250 --> 11:38.040
That's Nia's bra. Mom says it's totally
natural and nothing to laugh about.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.880
That's a bra? I thought Mom
shrunk all my tank tops.

11:50.290 --> 11:53.120
(forced chuckling)

11:53.120 --> 11:55.250
I'm gonna go hang out
on the roof deck...

11:55.250 --> 11:56.500
until college.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.830
Well, don't forget
your bra, sweetie.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.670
It was terrible, Tess.

12:09.670 --> 12:12.210
She was waving my bra
all over the living room.

12:13.710 --> 12:15.210
I can't do this anymore.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.170
Why don't you come live with me?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.960
You can sleep on the couch!

12:17.960 --> 12:19.380
You know what?
As I'm saying it,

12:19.380 --> 12:21.080
I hear everything
that's wrong with it.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.120
I don't know what to do.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.830
My mom is living
with her best friend,

12:25.830 --> 12:28.750
and Booker has the little
brother he's always wanted.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.540
I'm the only one
who isn't happy.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.500
Then talk to your mom.
When I lost Winky the hamster,

12:34.500 --> 12:36.830
I sat down with my mom
and we talked about it.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.790
And when we stood up,
my problem was solved.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.960
-How? -The hamster was hiding
under her butt the whole time.

12:43.710 --> 12:45.710
I can't talk to my mom
about this.

12:45.710 --> 12:47.540
Well, you have to talk
to someone.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.580
That's what parents are for.

12:49.580 --> 12:51.210
That is
what parents are for!

12:51.210 --> 12:53.290
Tess, you just gave me an idea!

12:53.290 --> 12:55.380
You're a really great friend

12:55.380 --> 12:56.710
but a terrible hamster owner.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.580
Oh, I didn't own that hamster.
I was pet sitting.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.250
Hey, buddy.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.670
C-- Can I come in,
or do you need some privacy?

13:08.670 --> 13:11.290
Wow, it's nice of you to ask.
Usually you just--

13:11.290 --> 13:12.750
I can't take this anymore!

13:15.670 --> 13:18.380
Give it to me straight,
do you hate livin' here?

13:18.380 --> 13:20.040
Why would I hate living here?

13:20.040 --> 13:22.920
Because, your old room
had all this great stuff,

13:22.920 --> 13:25.040
so I used my mom's credit card
to buy this trampoline,

13:25.040 --> 13:27.290
but you're already sick of it, and
we don't have any pineapple juice

13:27.290 --> 13:28.830
and now you're gonna move out!

13:28.830 --> 13:30.420
I'm not gonna move out.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.210
But I had a vision
of you moving.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.500
And I don't want you to leave.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.040
Booker, I love living here.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.960
So I had a bunch of great stuff
at my old house.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.210
You know what I didn't have?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.830
Your own laser tag arena?

13:41.830 --> 13:43.880
No. I had that.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.080
I didn't have a brother.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.210
I didn't have anyone
to hang out with,

13:49.210 --> 13:50.620
but now I have you.

13:52.580 --> 13:53.830
Yeah, you do.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.210
But wait... if my vision
wasn't about you moving,

13:58.210 --> 14:00.210
-who was it about?
-I don't know.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.040
Is someone not happy
livin' here?

14:02.040 --> 14:03.120
Let me think about this.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.960
There's Mom,
Aunt Chelsea, you, me...

14:09.210 --> 14:13.170
Mom, Aunt Chelsea,
you, me...

14:13.170 --> 14:14.290
Get there.

14:14.290 --> 14:17.210
-Oh, no, it's Nia!
-There you go.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.250
I gotta go find her.

14:24.290 --> 14:27.620
Uh, when did Nia put a poster of
Channing Tatum on the ceiling?

14:27.620 --> 14:32.080
Oh, that's not Nia's. No. No, I put
that up there when I moved in.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.670
I ain't mad at it.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.250
Mom, have you seen Nia?

14:37.250 --> 14:38.880
I just checked the roof deck
and she's not there.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.000
-She isn't? -She's nowhere
in the apartment, either.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.330
Well, that girl knows better than to
leave this house without permission.

14:43.330 --> 14:47.620
She tried to talk to me earlier. Somethin'
about privacy, but I wasn't listening.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.790
I think she's upset.

14:48.790 --> 14:50.120
Privacy?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.960
Well, she is sleeping
in the living room.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.290
Yeah, but she said
she was okay with that.

14:55.290 --> 14:58.330
-What are you doin'?
-Well, I'm trackin' her phone.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.790
You can do that?

14:59.790 --> 15:02.290
How do you think I find you
when you get lost at the mall?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.960
What is she doing
at Parlez Vous Cafe?

15:05.960 --> 15:10.250
Well, hopefully ordering off the happy
hour menu. That place is expensive.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.250
Excuse me, hi. It says
that my daughter is here.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.670
Have you seen her?
She's kinda--

15:22.670 --> 15:24.250
There she is,
there she is right there.

15:25.830 --> 15:26.880
Devon?

15:28.250 --> 15:30.620
Now why does she sneak out
to see Devon?

15:38.620 --> 15:40.420
-Hey, Mom!
-Oh snap!

15:43.080 --> 15:45.460
What are you doin'
out here unsupervised?

15:45.460 --> 15:47.330
I couldn't just stay at home.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.120
I had to find out
what's up with Nia.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.460
That's real sweet of you, but
you know you in trouble, right?

15:51.460 --> 15:53.670
-Dang.
-Stay outta sight.

15:57.380 --> 15:58.460
Raven:
All right.

16:00.380 --> 16:03.500
Ooh-wee.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.000
Hey, Booker, you see
all these flavors?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.080
-Wow! Yes, I can!
-Here, put these in your purse!

16:17.210 --> 16:21.880
I guess I was wondering if...
maybe I could come live with you?

16:22.920 --> 16:24.540
Both:
Oh, no.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.380
Nia, you wanna live with me?

16:30.380 --> 16:31.880
Just for a while.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.290
Our place is just so crazy
right now, I feel like...

16:35.960 --> 16:38.040
like there's no room for me.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.540
Well, have you talked
to your mom about this?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.920
(sighs)
Not yet.

16:42.290 --> 16:44.830
I can't believe Nia wants
to move in with her dad.

16:44.830 --> 16:47.250
-Let's just go talk to her.
-No, no, no, we can't do that.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.290
Then she'll think that I came
down here to spy on her.

16:49.290 --> 16:51.120
-Isn't that what we're doing?
-Shhh!

16:51.120 --> 16:53.040
I'm tryin' to listen!

16:53.040 --> 16:55.080
Hi. Can I help you?

16:55.080 --> 17:00.000
Oh. Oh, right, I need to make coffee
because I work here, got you.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.540
Booker, I need
a cup of coffee.

17:01.540 --> 17:03.880
Mom, it's after four,
you'll be up all night!

17:03.880 --> 17:05.750
It's not for me!

17:07.790 --> 17:10.830
Look, Nia, there's something
you need to know.

17:14.210 --> 17:16.330
That job interview I had today?

17:16.330 --> 17:17.460
I got it!

17:17.460 --> 17:19.290
Dad, that's amazing!

17:19.290 --> 17:22.040
But it's not in Chicago.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.330
Look, Nia, I'm gonna be the weekday
weatherman at a station in Dallas.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.000
You're moving?

17:31.080 --> 17:32.670
(coffee grinder running)

17:32.670 --> 17:35.500
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Keep it down!

17:35.500 --> 17:38.380
It's not my fault!
We grind to order.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.750
This is not how I wanted
to tell you.

17:42.750 --> 17:47.170
I-- I was hopin' to have you,
Book, your mom together.

17:47.170 --> 17:51.380
Look, Nia, I would love for you
to come live with me,

17:51.380 --> 17:54.170
but we're not talkin' about
movin' across town.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.330
I'd be living in Texas?

17:56.330 --> 18:00.290
Sweetheart, listen,
this is a huge change, okay?

18:00.290 --> 18:03.080
But if it's what you want...

18:03.080 --> 18:05.120
then we could talk
to your mom about it.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.210
-(flicking switch)
-(steam blasting)

18:11.210 --> 18:12.790
(banging on machine)

18:17.250 --> 18:18.790
What did you do?

18:18.790 --> 18:21.290
I don't know, I pushed a bunch of
buttons and I think I broke it!

18:21.290 --> 18:25.170
(machine shaking and whining)

18:25.170 --> 18:26.620
What is goin' on back there?

18:26.620 --> 18:30.120
(steam shooting out)

18:30.120 --> 18:31.290
(crash)

18:34.670 --> 18:35.790
Uh-oh! Gotta go!

18:38.040 --> 18:39.080
(both thud)

18:44.500 --> 18:47.670
Nia will be home any second. Go act like
you've been in your room all night.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.250
She's not really gonna
leave, is she?

18:49.250 --> 18:51.120
-I hope not. -But if she stays,
she still in more trouble

18:51.120 --> 18:53.880
-than I am, right? -Go to
your room, go to your room!

18:53.880 --> 18:56.210
Hey, Rae, I'm glad you're home, I
really need to show you something.

18:56.210 --> 18:58.170
Chels, Devon is moving to Texas,
and I think Nia's moving with him.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.420
What? Are you sure?

18:59.420 --> 19:01.330
Yes, no, I don't know, maybe!

19:01.330 --> 19:04.000
Chels, I can't have
my baby girl leave me.

19:06.670 --> 19:10.420
Hey, Rae. I hope you weren't
worried, but Nia was with me.

19:10.420 --> 19:12.330
Thanks, Devon.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.790
I'm just glad
she's safe.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.790
Talk to your mom? Okay.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.250
Baby, what's goin' on?

19:21.460 --> 19:22.830
I don't know
how to say this, but--

19:22.830 --> 19:24.830
Hey, guys, if I could get
your attention real quick.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.960
I just wanna
show you something.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.420
Hey, Chels? Could I
talk to my daughter?

19:32.670 --> 19:35.880
Nia... you can talk to me
about anything.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.210
You know that, right?

19:38.790 --> 19:41.920
Okay, I love having Aunt
Chelsea and Levi here, but...

19:43.120 --> 19:45.380
I feel like
there's no room for me.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.330
My whole life
is out in front of everybody.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I really wanna be okay
with it, but I'm not.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.170
Sweetheart, why didn't you
tell me this sooner?

19:53.170 --> 19:56.710
You were so happy, and-- and
Booker loves living with Levi.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.500
I didn't want to be
the one to ruin things.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.080
No, no, sweetie, you're--
you can't ruin anything.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.790
I'm sorry I didn't realize
you're unhappy.

20:04.790 --> 20:07.580
Guys, real quick. If I could
just show you something.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.250
Hey, Chels. Really!

20:09.250 --> 20:11.250
Not now!

20:11.250 --> 20:13.830
All right. Okay. Okay.

20:17.170 --> 20:20.960
Listen, baby girl.
You and your brother

20:20.960 --> 20:23.290
are the best things
that ever happened to me.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.210
So there's nothing more
important than your happiness.

20:26.210 --> 20:28.960
All right? We're gonna
find a way to fix this.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.710
Mmm, I love you,

20:33.710 --> 20:35.790
but I do have
a confession to make.

20:35.790 --> 20:39.420
(whispering)
Uh... I was at the cafe tonight.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.000
(whispering)
I know.

20:44.380 --> 20:45.790
(normal voice)
You blew up a coffee cart.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.880
But I did it
because I love you.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.330
(laughs)

20:51.330 --> 20:52.250
Please don't move.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.290
I don't wanna move.

20:53.290 --> 20:54.460
I don't want you to move.

20:54.460 --> 20:57.210
You won't have to!

20:57.210 --> 20:59.790
I'm sorry, I just really need
to show you guys something!

21:03.040 --> 21:05.830
Surprise! (laughs)

21:05.830 --> 21:11.460
Oh my gosh! It's my old
room, but-- but better.

21:11.460 --> 21:12.540
Chels, you did this?

21:12.540 --> 21:15.170
Oh, Levi helped.

21:15.170 --> 21:18.250
I mean, I may not be good at
laundry, you know, or cooking,

21:18.250 --> 21:22.210
but I can redecorate a bedroom,
like a boss! (laughs)

21:23.880 --> 21:25.250
I love it!

21:25.250 --> 21:27.540
Thank you, Aunt Chels.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.580
That was really cool of you
and Aunt Chels.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.710
It's best for everyone.
Movin' is the only option.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.710
That's disappointing.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.540
That was my vision! This is why
I thought you were moving!

21:42.540 --> 21:44.460
Did you see this box break?

21:44.460 --> 21:46.920
'Cause that would've been
nice to know.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.290
Thanks, again, Aunt Chels.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.080
Is that Channing Tatum?

21:53.080 --> 21:55.330
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's comin' with me.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.790
Wait.
You're not leaving, are you?

21:58.790 --> 22:00.960
Oh, no, no.
I got a roommate.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.170
-Who's your roommate?
-You.

22:02.170 --> 22:03.330
Say what?

22:06.620 --> 22:08.380
Hey, Chels, where'd you get
these bunk beds?

22:08.380 --> 22:10.880
You know that vacant lot where
everybody dumps their old stuff?

22:10.880 --> 22:13.210
-Chels! -Right next to
that is a furniture store.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.670
Hey, Chels?
I just wanna say thank you.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.120
You may not be great
at housework, but...

22:21.120 --> 22:22.460
this house wouldn't work
without you.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.580
Oh, Rae, I-- I'm really glad
I... returned that trampoline

22:28.580 --> 22:31.920
and got these bunk beds, so you
can't see me cryin' right now.

22:33.790 --> 22:35.210
What trampoline?

22:38.210 --> 22:39.380
(knocking on door)

22:39.380 --> 22:41.120
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.290
(chuckles)
I saw you at the cafe.

22:44.290 --> 22:47.460
Ohh, huh!
I see where this is goin'.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.960
I was just tryin' to help.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.170
Everyone thinks I'm
just this good-lookin',

22:51.170 --> 22:54.960
-naturally shredded, slam dunk master.
-Nobody thinks that.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.790
But, I messed up today.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.250
You tried to talk to me
and I shut you out.

23:01.250 --> 23:04.170
I promise I will never
ignore you again.

23:04.170 --> 23:06.960
Hmm... yeah, you will.

23:06.960 --> 23:10.080
-Yeah, I totally will.
-(both laugh)

23:10.080 --> 23:13.710
Man, I can't believe
Dad's moving.

23:13.710 --> 23:16.500
At least I'm not
losing you, too.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.880
I'm not going anywhere.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.710
Booker Baxter-Carter,
I know

23:20.710 --> 23:22.040
you did not buy
that trampoline

23:22.040 --> 23:23.120
I told you
not to buy

23:23.120 --> 23:24.210
on my
credit card!

23:25.540 --> 23:27.170
Sorry, Book. I'm out!
