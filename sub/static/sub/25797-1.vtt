02:50.342 --> 02:51.550
Ooh!

03:02.458 --> 03:04.677
I can't wait to try on my
new school uniform on.

03:04.701 --> 03:06.783
I'll put some cakes
out for you to take.

03:06.807 --> 03:09.061
You're gonna be the most
popular girl in the school

03:09.085 --> 03:11.121
when the children
taste my baking.

03:15.816 --> 03:17.794
Hey, nice shoes.

03:17.818 --> 03:20.900
The bells! The bells!

03:20.924 --> 03:22.271
The bells!

03:25.239 --> 03:26.941
Imagine if your mum
looked like that.

03:26.965 --> 03:28.173
I don't...

03:40.944 --> 03:43.119
You'll feel better after
a nice cup of tea.

03:55.649 --> 03:56.753
I've forgotten the milk.

04:02.828 --> 04:07.177
I could go to the shop we
saw 'round the corner.

04:10.664 --> 04:11.665
On your own?

04:43.800 --> 04:44.801
Hiya.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.229
Hello.

04:48.253 --> 04:50.127
I haven't seen you before.

04:50.151 --> 04:51.152
What's your name?

04:52.015 --> 04:53.154
Um, lona.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.067
What's your favorite animal?

04:59.091 --> 05:01.518
Uh, I like dogs.

05:01.542 --> 05:03.140
What's yours?

05:03.164 --> 05:05.177
Uh, I like cats.

05:05.201 --> 05:06.651
Yeah, all right.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.309
What are you thinking about?

05:18.421 --> 05:19.422
Those kittens.

05:29.259 --> 05:30.295
Love you, Dafty One.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.540
Love you, Dafty Two.

05:48.762 --> 05:49.797
What do you think?

06:00.912 --> 06:02.223
Where's that brandy?

06:10.128 --> 06:11.578
It's good for upset.

06:15.236 --> 06:17.066
But I'm not upset, Dafty.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.587
Today's the day I get
to meet my new friends.

07:10.706 --> 07:12.856
Where are you from?

07:12.880 --> 07:14.375
I don't know.

07:14.399 --> 07:16.791
I was abandoned as a baby.

07:16.815 --> 07:19.794
And this old hunchback lady
found me in the forest

07:19.818 --> 07:21.486
and looked after me.

07:21.510 --> 07:22.659
Abandoned?

07:22.683 --> 07:24.281
Hunchback?

07:24.305 --> 07:25.697
She loved me and raised me.

07:25.721 --> 07:26.836
And then, one day,

07:26.860 --> 07:28.631
she walked me to the
edge of the forest

07:28.655 --> 07:30.218
and set me free.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.417
Don't worry. We'll
take care of you.

07:42.807 --> 07:43.980
Oie, new girl.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.712
Have you sucked cock?

07:54.404 --> 07:55.658
Probably.

07:55.682 --> 07:56.866
Probably?

07:58.650 --> 08:00.076
Have you been fingered?

08:00.100 --> 08:02.043
'Cause we need to
know so we can decide

08:02.067 --> 08:03.424
if we want to be
friends with you.

08:03.448 --> 08:04.529
Or not.

08:09.005 --> 08:10.455
How many fingers can you take?

08:23.192 --> 08:24.752
She doesn't even know
what fingering is.

08:26.367 --> 08:27.368
She's a mummy's girl.

08:27.852 --> 08:29.750
Yeah. True.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.284
She's definitely a virgin.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.308
I'm sure.

08:40.243 --> 08:41.243
Yeah, that's right.

09:00.298 --> 09:01.862
I've been thinking
about you all day.

09:02.818 --> 09:03.933
Haven't we?

09:03.957 --> 09:06.038
I really liked
Chelsea and Stacie.

09:06.062 --> 09:08.271
But Keely's my best friend.

09:14.312 --> 09:15.831
And they really
liked your cakes.

09:20.076 --> 09:21.491
There's more where
they came from.

09:26.462 --> 09:27.784
What did you do today?

09:27.808 --> 09:29.741
Did you go to the
Community Center?

09:34.435 --> 09:35.435
I...

09:36.506 --> 09:38.174
I didn't... I had to
leave your brother.

09:39.993 --> 09:42.271
Look at him. He's
still unsettled.

09:49.692 --> 09:51.314
We'll struggle with this one.

09:59.529 --> 10:01.449
I've warmed your dressing
gown for you to put on.

10:06.847 --> 10:09.643
Keely asked me to go 'round
to catch up on schoolwork.

10:13.026 --> 10:14.165
I won't be long.

10:15.304 --> 10:16.305
Mm.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.411
Aw!

11:05.630 --> 11:06.700
So, uh...

11:09.530 --> 11:10.670
Have you got a boyfriend?

11:12.706 --> 11:13.706
No.

11:52.297 --> 11:53.747
The girls at school wear makeup.

11:55.784 --> 11:57.509
Aren't they a bit
young to wear makeup?

11:58.683 --> 12:00.167
They look really pretty.

12:10.971 --> 12:12.593
I think I might like some.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.909
Makeup gives boys the
wrong impression.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.813
One sign of lipstick,

12:25.848 --> 12:27.091
they behave like animals.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.547
I bet you'd look
really nice in makeup.

12:53.220 --> 12:54.774
Night, night, Dafty One.

13:11.514 --> 13:12.826
You forgot this.

13:13.413 --> 13:14.631
Thank you.

13:14.655 --> 13:16.841
I'm gonna be in the air
for a couple of days,

13:16.865 --> 13:19.222
so don't forget anything else.

13:19.246 --> 13:20.637
I promise.

13:20.661 --> 13:21.904
Have fun.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.878
Your mom is the best!

13:33.329 --> 13:36.136
Oh, my God!

13:36.160 --> 13:37.862
My mom's sewed a name
tag into my shorts.

13:39.577 --> 13:42.580
I'd bitch slap my mom if
she even breathed near me.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.390
What's up with your face, piggy?

13:49.414 --> 13:50.978
Is it upset,

13:51.002 --> 13:54.154
'cause your mom is
your best friend?

13:54.178 --> 13:55.213
And her lover.

13:56.076 --> 13:57.502
Two pigs together.

13:57.526 --> 13:59.528
Oink, oink.

14:02.531 --> 14:03.601
Did you see that?

14:36.220 --> 14:37.220
Don't you?

14:46.747 --> 14:48.094
Who's this now, Budgie?

14:50.441 --> 14:51.442
Who's this?

15:04.041 --> 15:06.112
Have you got some ladders
that I could borrow?

15:07.665 --> 15:09.091
Yes.

15:09.115 --> 15:11.196
Yes, yes, I have. Come...
Come in.

15:11.220 --> 15:12.500
- Do you want to come in?
- Um...

15:12.524 --> 15:13.889
I've got...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.821
Would you like a piece of fruitcake?
I've got some in the cupboard.

15:15.845 --> 15:18.652
It's a bit dry, but, it's very
nice with whipped butter on.

15:18.676 --> 15:20.412
I'm busy.

15:20.436 --> 15:22.093
Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

15:34.485 --> 15:35.485
Sorry.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.123
Sorry.

15:41.147 --> 15:42.251
Sorry.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.991
Sorry.

15:47.015 --> 15:48.464
Sorry...

15:50.294 --> 15:52.168
There you go. That's that.

15:52.192 --> 15:53.814
- That's it. There you go.
- Thank you.

15:55.126 --> 15:56.127
Thank you.

16:08.346 --> 16:10.627
I think I might have made a bit
of a friend there, Budgie.

16:49.077 --> 16:50.216
You've been busy.

16:53.391 --> 16:56.474
A friend from across the road
just borrowed the step ladder.

16:56.498 --> 16:58.178
I'll do the rest when
she brings them back.

16:58.603 --> 16:59.949
You made a friend?

17:02.676 --> 17:04.057
And I've been barn dancing.

17:29.117 --> 17:30.601
It's a bit like lipstick.

18:16.819 --> 18:18.235
I've got to nip out in a bit.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.584
Again?

18:24.448 --> 18:27.692
Well, Keely asked me round
to help her with algebra.

18:28.762 --> 18:31.155
When I told her how
you taught me,

18:31.179 --> 18:33.491
she said she wished her
mum was as clever as you.

18:37.806 --> 18:40.509
Well, I suppose it's only
right that you help her

18:40.533 --> 18:43.018
since she's been so kind to you.

19:01.979 --> 19:02.979
I'm 18 soon.

19:03.003 --> 19:04.798
I'm having a party at my house.

19:06.283 --> 19:08.285
Um, you're invited.

19:09.217 --> 19:11.080
Really?

19:12.461 --> 19:14.291
You can see my bedroom.

19:17.052 --> 19:18.053
Iona?

19:24.646 --> 19:25.647
Do you know that woman?

19:26.889 --> 19:28.902
She looks like the
village idiot.

19:30.307 --> 19:32.561
I just remembered I've
forgotten something.

19:32.585 --> 19:33.585
So...

21:05.333 --> 21:07.127
Are you in the bathtub, dear?

21:22.108 --> 21:23.108
Mom?

21:30.979 --> 21:33.292
Mom, what are you doing?

21:56.970 --> 21:58.223
There we go.

21:58.247 --> 21:59.387
All finished.

22:01.389 --> 22:02.528
Do you want to have a look?

22:08.154 --> 22:11.053
You'll have all the men in
all the land after you now.

22:14.091 --> 22:15.091
Hmm?

22:43.603 --> 22:45.191
Didn't know you had
a boyfriend, babe.

22:48.297 --> 22:51.542
Aw, is it another phantom
boyfriend, babe?

22:53.544 --> 22:54.694
Daz who?

22:54.718 --> 22:55.718
Fantine.

22:57.065 --> 23:00.251
Oh my God. He's like
an insignificant.

23:03.589 --> 23:05.694
Sometimes I wish I was
an insignificant.

23:07.558 --> 23:08.558
It's easier.

23:09.526 --> 23:10.596
Iona...

23:13.046 --> 23:14.427
Let me do your makeup, babe.

23:52.672 --> 23:54.743
Oh, sorry to bother you.
I was, um...

23:56.814 --> 23:58.367
I'm sorry, I was
just wondering...

23:58.920 --> 24:01.070
Um...

24:01.094 --> 24:03.442
I was just wondering if you'd
finished with the ladders.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.274
And I brought you this.

24:11.311 --> 24:12.311
I made it myself.

24:20.976 --> 24:21.976
Thanks.

24:23.289 --> 24:25.222
Bye, then. See you soon.

24:26.672 --> 24:27.845
Bye.

24:40.237 --> 24:41.376
You can look now.

24:46.174 --> 24:47.520
She looks amazing.

24:48.797 --> 24:50.178
She looks orange.

24:59.428 --> 25:00.716
So, the Holocaust

25:00.740 --> 25:03.363
took place from 1941

25:03.709 --> 25:05.687
to 1945.

25:05.711 --> 25:08.724
It was a mass genocide,

25:08.748 --> 25:11.037
which means lots of
people were killed.

25:11.061 --> 25:12.176
Oie, lona.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.731
Six million Jews were killed

25:15.755 --> 25:18.320
under very brutal circumstances.

25:18.344 --> 25:19.908
She is fit.

25:19.932 --> 25:22.497
It's got a name
in Hebrew, Shoah,

25:22.521 --> 25:24.706
which means "the catastrophe".

25:28.181 --> 25:29.597
Keely Johnson.

25:30.736 --> 25:31.920
Yes, babe.

25:34.878 --> 25:38.202
Being as you clearly don't
need to do any work, babe,

25:38.226 --> 25:40.706
you can explain to the rest of
the class what the Holocaust is.

25:43.472 --> 25:45.233
Is it a ride at
Alton Towers, sir?

25:50.721 --> 25:51.721
Carry on with your work.

25:56.451 --> 25:57.451
Iona...

25:59.074 --> 26:00.420
Come and sit with us, babe.

26:12.260 --> 26:13.260
Move over.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.609
Iona.

26:52.541 --> 26:53.542
Pets.

26:55.303 --> 26:56.304
Doctor.

26:57.546 --> 26:58.547
Council.

27:00.135 --> 27:01.734
Numbers are adding up, Budgie.

27:25.367 --> 27:27.552
"Stevie Babes."

27:27.576 --> 27:29.820
"Do you have questions
about the afterlife?"

27:32.961 --> 27:35.136
Do you have questions about
the afterlife, Budgie?

27:50.565 --> 27:51.739
You all right?

27:56.536 --> 27:57.676
You look nice.

27:58.987 --> 27:59.987
Thanks.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.267
Can't wait till four o'clock.

28:06.408 --> 28:09.422
Well, I promised Keely I'd
see her and the girls later.

28:09.446 --> 28:10.446
So...

28:11.103 --> 28:12.276
Keely Johnson?

28:13.622 --> 28:15.107
I didn't know you're
mates with her.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.281
Yes, babe.

28:19.007 --> 28:21.399
Hey, what about tomorrow?

28:28.776 --> 28:30.926
Together, together,
together, together.

28:30.950 --> 28:32.711
Together, together,
together, together.

28:34.402 --> 28:37.450
Together, together,
together, together.

28:37.474 --> 28:40.132
Together, together, together...

28:45.102 --> 28:46.342
What have you done to yourself?

29:09.817 --> 29:13.096
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm
sorry to bother you.

29:13.682 --> 29:14.683
But, um...

29:16.237 --> 29:18.077
I was wondering, um...

29:18.101 --> 29:19.516
Have you finished
with the ladders?

29:22.415 --> 29:23.415
No.

29:25.487 --> 29:28.836
Only, I was in the
middle of decorating

29:30.182 --> 29:31.528
when I lent them to you, and...

29:35.497 --> 29:38.097
Well, if you were still
using the ladders,

29:38.121 --> 29:39.363
why did you give them to me?

29:42.642 --> 29:43.712
Uh, I...

29:47.647 --> 29:48.647
Well, it...

30:01.869 --> 30:03.871
My friend still needs
the step ladders.

30:04.872 --> 30:06.183
So I'm getting creative.

30:11.361 --> 30:12.614
You say something?

30:16.987 --> 30:18.195
Doesn't matter.

30:21.336 --> 30:23.832
Is your mom as
pretty as you, lona?

30:23.856 --> 30:25.661
She's much prettier.

30:25.685 --> 30:27.042
She's an air hostess.

30:27.066 --> 30:29.665
Oh! I wish my mom
was an air hostess.

30:29.689 --> 30:30.735
Me, too!

30:37.249 --> 30:38.906
Have you ever had
an orgasm, babe?

30:40.666 --> 30:42.126
What, you mean like in biology?

30:44.221 --> 30:45.371
That's "organism".

30:49.675 --> 30:51.539
Arthur! Can I have a go?

30:54.576 --> 30:56.785
Leave it here and wait.

31:33.650 --> 31:34.650
Good, eh?

31:43.384 --> 31:44.557
Do you wanna skive?

31:48.492 --> 31:50.909
Feels funny without
Chelsea and Stacie.

31:52.393 --> 31:54.958
Sometimes it's nice
not being with them.

31:54.982 --> 31:56.604
All that giggling
does my head in.

32:00.332 --> 32:03.207
I bet you loved to move into
a new place, didn't you?

32:03.231 --> 32:05.509
Yeah. Especially since I
met you and the girls.

32:07.615 --> 32:13.562
The thing is with living
where you've always lived is

32:13.586 --> 32:16.244
you have to act how everyone
thinks you're gonna act.

32:18.453 --> 32:20.293
If I moved to a new place,

32:20.317 --> 32:21.501
where no one knew me,

32:21.525 --> 32:23.286
I'd be totally different.

32:24.459 --> 32:26.082
I wouldn't muck
around at school.

32:27.117 --> 32:28.670
And I'd be nice to my mom.

32:31.777 --> 32:34.857
Yeah, but wouldn't you miss having a
different cock in your mouth every night?

32:35.988 --> 32:37.276
Two cocks, you mean.

32:51.728 --> 32:52.798
What are you doing?

32:59.149 --> 33:00.149
Well...

33:01.462 --> 33:05.052
I thought maybe this
room could be my room.

33:11.334 --> 33:12.334
Yeah.

33:13.922 --> 33:14.923
Carry on.

33:16.339 --> 33:17.833
Um...

33:17.857 --> 33:19.721
I'm gonna need my own space now.

33:20.653 --> 33:22.000
Now that I'm dating.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.543
Budgie.

34:25.132 --> 34:26.443
Bu-Bu-Bu-Budgie.

34:28.721 --> 34:30.068
When's your big date again?

34:31.483 --> 34:33.657
Friday, seven o'clock.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.280
On the dot.

34:38.592 --> 34:39.835
And I'll be home late.

34:41.424 --> 34:44.127
Well, that's a shame.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.393
I invited all the girls
around on Friday evening.

35:04.481 --> 35:06.252
Right then, darling.

35:06.276 --> 35:07.760
Have fun at your party.

35:09.797 --> 35:11.109
Thanks, Mum.

35:11.764 --> 35:14.605
Oh, my God.

35:14.629 --> 35:16.509
Does your granny live here
as well or something?

35:26.054 --> 35:27.239
Hi, come in.

35:27.263 --> 35:28.481
You all right?

35:28.505 --> 35:30.058
What is this?

35:31.819 --> 35:34.822
Iona, meet Sicko, my cousin.

35:36.203 --> 35:37.342
You all right?

35:41.277 --> 35:43.807
This is exciting.

35:43.831 --> 35:45.429
Does that thing ever shut up?

35:45.453 --> 35:47.075
Give it some whiskey
and chill it out.

35:49.975 --> 35:51.332
- Don't.
- Do.

35:51.356 --> 35:54.566
It might fall off its perch
and give us all a laugh.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.202
What are you doing?

35:59.226 --> 36:01.466
It's not good to keep it locked
in a cage all day, is it?

36:05.577 --> 36:07.337
He's so funny.

36:13.378 --> 36:15.356
I saw this film on YouTube

36:15.380 --> 36:17.979
where some girls
ate some birdseed

36:18.003 --> 36:20.005
and it made them horny.

36:20.523 --> 36:21.534
I want some.

36:21.558 --> 36:23.353
Hmm. Well, have you got any?

36:24.734 --> 36:26.194
Yeah, I think so.

36:26.218 --> 36:29.163
Honestly, they were
so off their faces

36:29.187 --> 36:31.165
they kept flashing their bits.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.752
Hurry up with that birdseed.

36:35.745 --> 36:37.171
- Oh, shit.
- Iona.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.725
Your bird has broken a
beautiful ornament.

36:42.234 --> 36:43.960
It's just knocked another over.

36:47.860 --> 36:49.355
What you doing, you dickhead?

36:49.379 --> 36:50.622
Oh, fuck off.

36:55.282 --> 36:56.707
Budgie went a bit wild.

37:05.292 --> 37:06.441
Is it working?

37:06.465 --> 37:08.063
Is it? Fuck.

37:08.087 --> 37:10.469
Oh, my God. I actually
feel really horny.

37:11.574 --> 37:12.609
Give me some.

37:14.715 --> 37:15.864
Oh, my God.

37:15.888 --> 37:17.131
I actually feel lush.

37:21.963 --> 37:23.102
Me, too.

37:24.414 --> 37:26.081
Are you horny, Chelsea?

37:26.105 --> 37:27.290
Yes.

37:27.314 --> 37:28.705
Are you, Sicko?

37:28.729 --> 37:30.154
I'm always horny.

37:31.318 --> 37:33.951
Good. 'Cause lona wants
you to shag her.

37:33.975 --> 37:35.391
Don't you, lona?

37:49.301 --> 37:50.301
Shit.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.731
Sicko, you fat fuck.

37:54.755 --> 37:57.033
I'll buy you a new
one, lona, I'm sorry.

38:01.624 --> 38:03.004
Are you all right, lona?

38:06.007 --> 38:08.872
Put it back in its cage.
It might come around.

38:13.049 --> 38:14.854
Come on, mate.

38:14.878 --> 38:18.651
I know. Let's play
flip and strip.

38:18.675 --> 38:21.229
Iona, babes. Heads or tails?

38:23.024 --> 38:24.060
Tails.

38:25.544 --> 38:27.305
Ooh!

38:30.342 --> 38:32.171
- Heads.
- Yeah!

38:33.897 --> 38:35.703
You'll have to take
something off.

38:35.727 --> 38:36.980
Get your top off.

38:37.004 --> 38:40.052
Get your tits out.
Get your tits out.

38:40.076 --> 38:41.364
Get your tits out for the lads.

38:41.388 --> 38:42.734
Take a sock off.

38:44.011 --> 38:45.471
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God.

38:45.495 --> 38:46.541
Only a sock?

38:46.565 --> 38:48.681
A sock? Come on, man.

38:48.705 --> 38:50.062
That one sock though.

38:50.086 --> 38:51.087
It's a pair.

39:38.928 --> 39:40.423
It's tails.

39:40.447 --> 39:42.932
I'll be naked if I take
anything else off.

39:44.036 --> 39:45.866
Boys have taken more
off than you have.

39:49.628 --> 39:52.424
Uh, what are you doing?

39:53.529 --> 39:54.920
I'm gonna go home early.

39:54.944 --> 39:56.715
I've got a little
foster brother, so...

39:56.739 --> 39:58.292
I don't want you to go.

39:59.293 --> 40:00.398
Sorry, babe.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.572
See ya.

40:06.921 --> 40:07.921
Bye.

40:08.302 --> 40:09.407
Bye-bye.

40:11.167 --> 40:12.316
Chicken bitch.

40:12.340 --> 40:13.456
Fuck her.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.974
Come on, then, lona.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.737
I knew she'd do it.

40:30.117 --> 40:31.117
Oh!

40:38.850 --> 40:39.954
Heads or tails?

40:40.748 --> 40:42.657
It's not my turn.

40:42.681 --> 40:45.108
Sorry, you wasn't quick enough.

40:45.132 --> 40:46.961
Come on. Rules are rules.

40:53.209 --> 40:55.349
Oh, my God. She's
actually gonna do it.

40:58.283 --> 41:00.468
Oh, my God.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.091
Ha! Got ya.

41:52.786 --> 41:55.305
Hi, this is Keely.
Leave me a message.

41:56.030 --> 41:57.491
Hey, babes.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.803
I keep texting you. Can
you text me back, please?

41:59.827 --> 42:01.208
Thanks, bye.

42:38.832 --> 42:39.832
What you doing?

42:42.214 --> 42:43.457
I'm going to see the girls.

43:10.070 --> 43:11.105
Hello, and good evening.

43:12.935 --> 43:14.384
My name is Stevie Babes,

43:15.316 --> 43:18.492
and I am the people's psychic.

43:25.706 --> 43:28.122
My friends, I was at an
event like this last week.

43:30.504 --> 43:32.275
A young man came to me,

43:32.299 --> 43:33.472
in spirit.

43:36.303 --> 43:37.753
My friends, this young man

43:39.996 --> 43:41.042
had hung himself.

43:43.413 --> 43:44.932
Because he was being bullied.

43:48.073 --> 43:49.454
His parents were
in the audience,

43:50.489 --> 43:52.181
hoping for a message.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.463
Indeed, their son was there.

44:00.120 --> 44:02.270
Because he's always
there with them.

44:02.294 --> 44:04.089
He never leaves their side.

44:06.367 --> 44:08.414
And this young man told me

44:08.438 --> 44:09.785
since being in the spirit world,

44:10.682 --> 44:12.304
he'd never been happier.

44:13.616 --> 44:14.824
Whereas the bullies

44:16.861 --> 44:18.103
were miserable...

44:20.519 --> 44:21.935
and consumed with guilt.

44:23.764 --> 44:26.629
I asked his parents if anything
nice had happened to them recently.

44:27.561 --> 44:28.666
And then his mum said,

44:30.391 --> 44:32.359
"We recently got
double glazing."

44:34.568 --> 44:36.950
I said, "Your son sent you
that double glazing."

44:45.821 --> 44:46.891
My friends,

44:49.031 --> 44:51.033
there is no such thing as death.

44:53.898 --> 44:55.796
Only transformation.

45:10.086 --> 45:12.006
You've had your struggles
too, haven't you, Mama?

45:15.989 --> 45:20.510
There's a big, beautiful,
fluffy white cat

45:21.270 --> 45:22.271
that's on your lap.

45:24.756 --> 45:27.977
That cat has chosen you,

45:28.001 --> 45:30.451
because you have an infinite
amount of love to give.

45:31.418 --> 45:32.902
Let it flow, my love.

45:34.628 --> 45:36.112
Let it flow.

45:45.087 --> 45:46.467
And feed that cat.

45:59.446 --> 46:01.562
You made out like we were
boyfriend and girlfriend,

46:01.586 --> 46:02.656
and then you...

46:04.796 --> 46:06.280
You treat me like shit.

46:13.736 --> 46:15.082
I didn't mean to.

46:18.810 --> 46:19.915
Sorry.

47:33.057 --> 47:35.483
She was ringing me all weekend.

47:35.507 --> 47:38.003
- I didn't answer.
- Oh, she's coming.

47:38.027 --> 47:39.384
Hi, babes.

47:39.408 --> 47:41.368
I've been trying to get a
hold of you all weekend.

47:42.549 --> 47:43.861
Oh, sorry babes.

47:45.966 --> 47:47.633
So, as we see,

47:47.657 --> 47:50.395
words and language evolve.

47:50.419 --> 47:53.215
Can anyone give me
a recent example?

47:55.769 --> 47:57.022
Yeah, Keller?

47:57.046 --> 48:00.060
MILF. Mothers I'd Like To Fuck.

48:00.084 --> 48:02.845
Okay, thank you. Anyone else?

48:04.605 --> 48:05.686
Yes, Keely.

48:05.710 --> 48:06.929
Frenemy.

48:06.953 --> 48:08.723
When you're, like,
friends with someone,

48:08.747 --> 48:11.934
but really, you hate them.

48:11.958 --> 48:13.245
Yeah, good.

48:13.269 --> 48:16.524
So I want five different
words from everyone.

48:16.548 --> 48:18.468
And I don't want to see
you with the same answers

48:18.492 --> 48:19.772
as the person next to you, okay?

48:20.173 --> 48:21.173
Go.

48:48.063 --> 48:49.202
No way!

49:00.972 --> 49:02.042
Hey.

49:04.734 --> 49:05.735
What's going on?

49:09.567 --> 49:11.776
Keely and Stacie sent those
photos of you around.

49:13.019 --> 49:14.158
When you stripped.

49:14.779 --> 49:16.125
Sent them where?

49:18.990 --> 49:20.129
Everywhere.

49:23.270 --> 49:24.409
Why would they do that?

49:26.791 --> 49:28.344
'Cause they like
making people unhappy.

49:52.886 --> 49:53.887
Hi.

49:57.822 --> 50:00.273
Keely and the girls bought you these.
Said they're sorry.

50:05.174 --> 50:07.625
I thought later maybe we
could do a jigsaw together.

51:05.407 --> 51:06.753
Where's your boyfriend?

51:23.908 --> 51:25.185
I liked your photos.

52:20.861 --> 52:22.139
Iona!

52:27.765 --> 52:28.766
Iona?

52:53.998 --> 52:55.596
You were out late.

52:55.620 --> 52:56.966
Were you on another date?

52:58.692 --> 52:59.692
Here.

53:00.211 --> 53:01.211
Oh.

53:06.838 --> 53:08.530
No, it's mine.

53:10.359 --> 53:11.360
Leave it!

53:20.645 --> 53:22.406
What are you doing
with my phone?

54:03.378 --> 54:04.379
Hey.

54:07.761 --> 54:09.321
I waited for you at
the pond last night.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.696
He's seeing Keely now, babe?

54:12.249 --> 54:13.674
Didn't you know?

54:13.698 --> 54:14.898
You don't mind, do you, babes?

54:18.151 --> 54:19.221
Of course not.

54:48.077 --> 54:49.078
I'm Lyn.

54:50.494 --> 54:53.290
My daughter's a sexual maniac
and I need some friends.

54:58.674 --> 55:01.332
It's my fault,
because I used to...

55:03.161 --> 55:05.474
dress up and go out at night
and hope I get raped,

55:09.029 --> 55:10.030
so I could have a child.

55:12.688 --> 55:13.862
So I could have someone.

55:18.625 --> 55:20.144
This is a friendship group,

55:21.145 --> 55:22.249
not a freak show.

55:25.287 --> 55:27.990
Linda is right. This
is a friendship group.

55:28.014 --> 55:29.981
Sounds like you might
need a support group.

55:31.224 --> 55:32.467
Or a belt.

55:36.298 --> 55:38.311
It weren't meant
to be like this.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.784
We were meant to be a success.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.837
But I'm that useless

55:47.861 --> 55:50.221
that I can't even get my step
ladders back from my neighbor.

55:51.244 --> 55:52.832
I'll give you your
step ladders back...

55:54.420 --> 55:56.190
if you'll do us all a favor

55:56.214 --> 55:58.123
and throw yourself off them.

56:10.677 --> 56:11.747
Excuse me?

56:12.265 --> 56:13.656
Excuse me.

56:13.680 --> 56:16.970
Um, I'm studying
psychology online,

56:16.994 --> 56:19.824
and I could help provide you with
the tools to avoid things like...

56:20.653 --> 56:22.700
like your ladder situation.

56:22.724 --> 56:25.806
I'm leading an assertiveness
session here on Thursday.

56:25.830 --> 56:27.360
It'll be a safe environment

56:27.384 --> 56:29.247
with less than a
handful of people.

56:30.939 --> 56:32.250
Should I put your name down?

57:28.134 --> 57:29.534
What are you wearing
to Daz's party?

57:32.069 --> 57:33.253
My fuck me dress.

57:33.277 --> 57:34.565
What about you?

57:34.589 --> 57:36.453
My fuck me shoes.

57:37.730 --> 57:39.076
I wonder what lona's gonna wear.

57:39.973 --> 57:41.319
A cushion?

57:42.942 --> 57:44.944
Nothing, 'cause
she's not invited.

57:58.267 --> 57:59.476
Can I see you tonight?

58:00.615 --> 58:02.306
I thought you were
seeing Keely now?

58:03.825 --> 58:05.319
That was my twin, silly.

58:05.343 --> 58:06.823
It's "bring your twin
to school" week.

58:07.863 --> 58:08.968
Isn't your twin here?

58:20.876 --> 58:23.683
Iona, too! Come and sit with us.

58:23.707 --> 58:26.858
We were just saying how we like
you much more than your twin.

58:26.882 --> 58:28.032
Can we keep you?

58:28.056 --> 58:30.931
Actually, I've got a confession.

58:30.955 --> 58:33.451
I'm lona One, not lona Two.

58:34.476 --> 58:35.591
Oh, my God!

58:35.615 --> 58:37.628
We really thought you
were your sister.

58:37.652 --> 58:41.217
You've made us remember why we loved
you so much in the first place.

58:41.241 --> 58:43.047
Let's all be best friends again.

58:43.071 --> 58:44.071
Okay.

58:44.969 --> 58:45.970
Super.

59:22.213 --> 59:23.767
Can I stand with you, please?

59:25.216 --> 59:26.216
What's it worth?

59:33.604 --> 59:35.399
Pretty good.

59:40.128 --> 59:43.383
Our language, both
body and vocal,

59:43.407 --> 59:46.306
plays a large part in how
we communicate ourselves.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.285
So, Lyn,

59:49.309 --> 59:50.759
would you like to get up

59:51.484 --> 59:53.072
and stand where I am?

01:00:09.088 --> 01:00:12.056
I was just wondering if I could
have my ladders back, please?

01:00:12.816 --> 01:00:13.955
No.

01:00:17.683 --> 01:00:18.798
That's fine.

01:00:18.822 --> 01:00:20.385
So you just...

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.456
look her in the eye, if you can,

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.759
and saying... say what
you want to, again.

01:00:33.526 --> 01:00:34.526
I'm sorry.

01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:38.185
I just really need them.

01:00:41.499 --> 01:00:42.499
Tough.

01:00:46.746 --> 01:00:48.437
Why won't you give
me my ladders back?

01:00:51.475 --> 01:00:54.488
Because you are an ugly freak.

01:00:54.512 --> 01:00:57.308
And every time I look at you,

01:00:58.482 --> 01:01:00.518
It makes me physically sick.

01:01:24.888 --> 01:01:26.027
Keely?

01:01:30.825 --> 01:01:32.033
Is it Keely, isn't it?

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:35.692
I'm lona's mummy.

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:40.144
Thank you.

01:01:43.527 --> 01:01:45.563
Thank you for the
beautiful flowers.

01:02:05.169 --> 01:02:06.999
Hello. You left this at
the community center.

01:02:07.896 --> 01:02:09.391
Oh, sorry.

01:02:09.415 --> 01:02:10.416
Thank you.

01:02:13.246 --> 01:02:15.811
Um, we've all had a
chat within the group,

01:02:15.835 --> 01:02:20.609
and everybody agrees that
you don't really fit in.

01:02:20.633 --> 01:02:23.118
And we think that perhaps you
might not want to come again.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.340
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:27.364 --> 01:02:28.790
Thank you.

01:02:28.814 --> 01:02:29.814
Of course.

01:02:30.816 --> 01:02:31.816
Sorry.

01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:34.646
Thank you.

01:02:37.823 --> 01:02:38.823
Thank you.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.658
What are you doing?

01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:26.112
Will you come sit
with me, please?

01:03:35.708 --> 01:03:37.237
I'd better go in a minute.

01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:38.815
Mum's making a chili.

01:03:58.282 --> 01:04:00.215
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

01:04:03.736 --> 01:04:07.153
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty...

01:05:23.298 --> 01:05:24.782
Gate-crasher alert.

01:05:26.819 --> 01:05:29.177
What did the waitress
say to the camel?

01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:32.411
I don't know. What did the
waitress say to the camel?

01:05:33.032 --> 01:05:35.932
"One hump or two?"

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.281
What have I done to make
you so horrible to me?

01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:43.053
Excuse me.

01:05:43.077 --> 01:05:45.089
I'm the victim here.

01:05:45.113 --> 01:05:49.197
I'm the one who had to
look at your ugly mother.

01:06:04.443 --> 01:06:06.479
Just you fucking wait!

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:15.143
I'll fucking kill her!

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:40.375
Open the fucking door!

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.182
Now!

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:46.806
I'm gonna kill you!

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.695
You bitch!

01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:57.151
Let me in!

01:07:22.003 --> 01:07:23.636
Don't worry.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.213
I've killed them, darling.

01:07:37.536 --> 01:07:38.916
Come on, darling.

01:07:53.552 --> 01:07:55.495
It's gonna build an intensity.

01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:57.359
But you can only say
certain things.

01:07:57.383 --> 01:07:59.879
So you can only say,
"Yes, you will."

01:07:59.903 --> 01:08:02.088
And you can only
say, "No, I won't."

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:04.504
Okay? You ready?
Let's give it a go.

01:08:04.528 --> 01:08:06.886
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:08.474
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:08.498 --> 01:08:10.476
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.340
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:12.364 --> 01:08:13.996
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.826
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.551
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:17.576 --> 01:08:19.346
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:21.107
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:22.935
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.111
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:26.906
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.701
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:28.725 --> 01:08:30.011
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:30.036 --> 01:08:31.738
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:33.557
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

01:08:33.902 --> 01:08:34.902
Iona?

01:08:40.219 --> 01:08:41.393
Are you okay?

01:09:11.216 --> 01:09:12.424
What are you doing?

01:09:16.117 --> 01:09:17.567
I missed you!

01:09:32.133 --> 01:09:33.307
Look, just...

01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:39.692
Go home.

01:09:41.107 --> 01:09:42.316
Yeah?

01:10:11.621 --> 01:10:14.071
What's this about you having
your hands on my boyfriend?

01:10:15.314 --> 01:10:17.430
You don't even like him.

01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:19.525
If you don't get down
to the pond right now,

01:10:20.526 --> 01:10:21.700
we're coming to your house.

01:10:31.054 --> 01:10:32.089
Mum...

01:10:36.059 --> 01:10:37.371
I was thinking...

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:41.513
maybe we could move again?

01:10:45.482 --> 01:10:46.908
Why would I want
to move anywhere

01:10:46.932 --> 01:10:48.589
with someone who's
got a reputation?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.764
Here's the slag.

01:11:59.418 --> 01:12:00.775
Come quick.

01:12:00.799 --> 01:12:02.628
Them girls have got lona.

01:12:22.096 --> 01:12:23.304
It's all right.

01:12:24.478 --> 01:12:25.755
I've got you.

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:28.620
You're safe.

01:12:30.656 --> 01:12:33.003
It was an accident.

01:12:34.177 --> 01:12:35.834
We were having fun.

01:12:38.008 --> 01:12:39.113
And your party?

01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:57.200
Please stay with me.

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.238
I'll never, ever leave you.

01:13:04.897 --> 01:13:07.348
I'm always, always with you.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.206
I want my ladders back, please.

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:29.750
- But I've not fin...
- I want my ladders back, please!

01:13:30.716 --> 01:13:32.408
Give me back my ladders.

01:14:24.218 --> 01:14:25.978
Hello? Uh, Keely?

01:14:27.117 --> 01:14:29.119
It's... It's lona's mummy.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:35.239
Um, lona told me and
the police how...

01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:37.473
how brave you and Stacie were,

01:14:38.646 --> 01:14:40.579
when you saved her
from those thugs.

01:14:43.168 --> 01:14:44.480
I wanted to...

01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:47.897
Well, I'd like to
give you some money

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.427
as a reward.

01:14:50.451 --> 01:14:51.451
To thank you.

01:14:55.076 --> 01:14:56.146
Come in.

01:15:05.155 --> 01:15:06.294
I'm upstairs.

01:15:27.937 --> 01:15:30.664
