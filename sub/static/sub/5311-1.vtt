00:39.956 --> 00:47.046
It's today! lt's today!

00:49.007 --> 00:51.133
It's today! lt's today! It's today!

00:51.301 --> 00:52.968
It's always today, George.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.471
-I mean, this is the day.
-That's right.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.682
-Can't l come?
-You have to go to school, George.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.977
-Will he be here when I get home?
-I think so.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.897
I'll play ball with him.
I'll wrestle with him.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.024
I'll teach him how to spit.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.693
-It's gonna be so much fun.
-For all of us.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.488
How will you know
if you're picking the right one?

01:13.323 --> 01:14.656
I don't know. We'll....

01:14.824 --> 01:16.075
You'll just know.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.244
Yeah. Bye, sweetie.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.669
Remember, l want a little brother,
not a big brother.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.345
We've been through your paperwork.
Everything seems to be in order.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.305
Adoption isn't for everyone...

01:38.473 --> 01:41.433
...but you seem like people
with plenty of love to share.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.520
So how are you feeling?

01:44.687 --> 01:46.313
-Goodness, we're--
-Tingling--

01:46.481 --> 01:47.731
With anticipation.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.191
Oh, recess.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.360
Time for you to meet them.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.696
Feel free to walk around.
They're used to having strangers here.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.657
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.870
Lovely people.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.219
Nice move, Red.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.736
Oh, Frederick, look at them.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.739
-How could we possibly--?
-Choose? l know.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.075
-They all seem so--
-Wonderful.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.661
You know what's wonderful?

02:42.996 --> 02:47.374
What's wonderful is how you both know
what the other one is gonna say...

02:47.542 --> 02:49.668
...before you even say it.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.089
Not that it's any of my business.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.927
Yes, well, that happens when you've
been together as long as we have.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.429
From being a family.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.849
A family, wow.

03:04.017 --> 03:08.145
Well, for a family, you've certainly
come to the right place.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.732
I think we can find just
what you're looking for.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.276
If you want a girl,
Susan can read French.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.863
And Edith over there can tap-dance
while blowing bubbles.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.449
Or maybe you wanted a boy.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.118
Actually, I think we were leaning
towards a boy.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.786
Well, in that case...

03:25.830 --> 03:27.956
...Benny can do handstands.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.460
And Andy can run 1 00 yards faster
than you can say, "Ready, set, go."

03:31.920 --> 03:33.962
You certainly know a lot
about everyone.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.591
That's what happens when
you've been here as long as I have.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.471
Let's face it. Not everyone wants
to adopt someone like me.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.849
You shouldn't worry about choosing.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.643
It happens the same way every time.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.146
First, you won't know what to do.
You'll be a little bit scared.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.981
Then you'll meet one of them.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.900
You'll talk to him.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.235
And somehow...

03:56.778 --> 03:58.237
...you just know.

04:07.163 --> 04:11.833
Are you quite certain you're prepared
to handle his uniqueness?

04:12.001 --> 04:13.669
Oh, my, yes, yes.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.922
His uniqueness is a perfect fit
for the Little family.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.339
Perfect.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.636
Mr. and Mrs. Little,
we try to discourage couples...

04:22.804 --> 04:25.722
...from adopting children
outside their own...

04:28.017 --> 04:29.226
...species.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.728
It rarely works out.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.356
Well, it will in this case.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.426
Bye, Stuart!

05:02.593 --> 05:04.803
Bye! We'll miss you!

05:11.352 --> 05:13.103
So, what do I call you?

05:13.271 --> 05:14.730
-Mom.
-And Dad.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.733
We haven't told you the best news
of all. You have a brother.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.984
Named George.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.402
A brother!

05:20.570 --> 05:23.822
-What do I call him?
-George.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.580
Well, Stuart, here we are,
the family home.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.291
They say every Little in the world
can find this house.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.251
Even if they've never
been here before.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.630
It's just something inside them.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.557
Something inside.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.143
So would you like a tour?

06:35.603 --> 06:37.187
I don't have any money.

06:37.605 --> 06:41.817
That's Uncle Crenshaw,
Cousin Edgar, Grandpa Spencer.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.652
That's Aunt Beatrice.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.196
And that's George, your brother.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.324
Look, he's already happy to see me.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.079
Well, that's just about everybody,
except for--

06:56.374 --> 06:58.333
Snowbell! Drop him right now!

06:58.501 --> 07:02.003
You spit Stuart out this instant,
Snowbell. Spit him right out.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.340
Stuart, are you all right?

07:05.508 --> 07:07.008
Wait!

07:09.011 --> 07:10.011
I'm fine.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.180
You must never harm Stuart.
You understand?

07:12.348 --> 07:14.391
Never, or out you'll go, Mr. Snow.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.936
Stuart is family now.
We do not eat family members.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.105
Mom, Dad, l'm home!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.400
Is he here? Is my brother here?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.735
-He certainly is.
-Where is he?

07:25.903 --> 07:28.613
He's here. Stuart, this is George.

07:29.699 --> 07:33.076
George, this is Stuart,
your new brother.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.704
No. Really?

07:36.080 --> 07:39.040
Really, George.
This is your new brother.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.878
You look somewhat like a mouse.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.882
Yeah, well,
I am somewhat like a mouse.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.633
I see.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.635
I have to go.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.107
Is it just me or did he seem
a little disappointed?

08:04.317 --> 08:08.195
Well, he's always a little tired
after school.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.447
Perks up around dinnertime.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.248
Meat loaf is delicious, dear.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.042
Cajun.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.755
Shall we get to know each other
a little?

08:26.923 --> 08:30.008
George, don't you have anything
you wanna ask Stuart?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.928
Sure, George. Go ahead.
I'm an open book.

08:33.095 --> 08:36.597
Ask me anything, the first thing
that pops into your head.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.308
Could you pass the gravy?

08:43.481 --> 08:46.024
-Your new bedroom, Stuart.
-We hope you like it.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.027
Sure is roomy.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.204
Good night, Mom.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.165
Good night, Dad.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.627
-Good night, son.
-Good night, sweetie.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.614
Nice kitty.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.366
Nice kitty. Pretty kitty.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.494
Are you cozy?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.081
Yes, thanks.
I'm quite comfortable.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.167
All I've got to sleep on is a rag
in the corner, you little rat.

09:47.128 --> 09:51.381
-You seem tense.
-Tense? Oh, I'm way past tense.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.842
Well, maybe l can help.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.886
What do you like?
Can I scratch your ears?

09:57.513 --> 09:58.930
I could rub your tummy.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.850
How'd you like to rub it
from the inside, mouse boy?

10:02.143 --> 10:05.353
Sorry, I'm a little confused.
I thought that's what you do with a pet.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.606
A pet? I am not your pet!

10:07.773 --> 10:10.609
I'm a cat. You're a mouse.
You should be living in a hole.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.527
This is my family.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.362
Can't we share them?

10:14.530 --> 10:18.283
Read my furry pink lips: No.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.953
I can't believe this.
I'm arguing with lunch.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.580
And stay away from the windows.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.458
The other cats find out about this,
I'm ruined.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.254
I gotta relax.
Where's my tinkle ball?

10:35.509 --> 10:39.471
-George, time to get up.
-Okay, Mom.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.723
Stuart, you too.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.892
Okay, Mom.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.111
George, l'm trying to get
the laundry started.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.862
Okay.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.453
-In the laundry chute, please.
-Okay.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.835
Thank you.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.595
Oh, dear.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.057
Mom! Hello! Mom!

12:06.517 --> 12:09.644
It's Stuart!
I'm in the washing machine. Mom!

12:09.812 --> 12:11.646
Hello, Mom!

12:17.862 --> 12:19.362
Where are you going?

12:30.207 --> 12:32.959
-That's odd.
-What is?

12:33.127 --> 12:36.588
-I thought someone was at the door.
-You look beautiful, dear.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.508
Honey, should we talk to George
before you go?

12:40.676 --> 12:42.677
-About what?
-About Stuart.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.930
He hasn't exactly
embraced the situation.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.932
Snowbell!
Thank goodness you're here.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.393
Do you believe this?
I'm locked in the washer.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.521
Can you help me?
Can you turn this thing off?

12:54.940 --> 12:57.358
Why would I turn it off?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.944
It's my favorite show.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.032
That's funny.
That's funny, Snowbell.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.618
-You can't leave me!
-Talk to the butt.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.244
Snowbell, where are you going?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.872
I've gotta stare at traffic,
yawn, lick myself.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.794
And believe me, that could take hours
if you do it right. Ciao!

13:18.047 --> 13:20.131
Are you sure that Stuart
is happy here?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.217
Oh, he's having the time of his life.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.553
Help! Somebody, please help me!

13:27.389 --> 13:29.057
Bye.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.150
Hi, Stuart.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.736
Help!

13:41.904 --> 13:43.154
Stuart!

13:45.908 --> 13:47.700
Stuart, where are you?

13:48.994 --> 13:50.161
Stuart. Stuart.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.583
Stuart, are you all right?

13:56.252 --> 13:59.045
I'm okay, Mom. I'm--

14:16.856 --> 14:18.022
Is he gonna be all right?

14:18.190 --> 14:22.777
Well, a lad that size
swallowing all that detergent....

14:22.945 --> 14:26.155
Amazingly,
I think he's gonna be fine.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.577
Also he's very clean.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.793
-Glad you're feeling better, Stuart.
-Me too.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.337
So exciting.
We'll pick out a whole new wardrobe.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.756
Here you go.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.470
Come on, George. This'll be fun.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.390
-I don't wanna go shopping with Stuart.
-George!

14:52.558 --> 14:55.602
-Oh, maybe you should--
-Talk to him? You're right.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.649
So, George, I wanted to talk
to you about Stuart.

15:01.817 --> 15:05.028
I just want you to know that
if you and he were to spend...

15:05.195 --> 15:08.031
...some real time together,
you know, brother time--

15:08.198 --> 15:09.490
Look at that one.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.746
Come on, George.
You have a boat, a beautiful one.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.331
It's not finished.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.917
Well, you better get moving.
The race is soon.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.710
So?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.505
Don't you want to race your boat?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.675
-I'm not so good at the racing part.
-So what?

15:27.843 --> 15:31.679
It doesn't matter about winning.
You try like heck and you have fun.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.265
It's fun to finish last?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.353
Something formal, I should think.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.230
I'm not sure of the fabric,
but it should breathe.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.524
He has a tendency to burrow
and climb...

15:43.692 --> 15:45.777
...and generally scurry about.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.698
Well, I'm sure we can find something
to suit your particular need.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.578
Here we have Barbados Ben.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.039
Chef Ben.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.793
Lumberjack Ben.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.420
And, of course, Gladiator Ben.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.007
Yes.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.636
-Does Ben always dress like this?
-No, no, no, madam.

16:11.804 --> 16:17.433
There are many moods of Ben
and it all depends on the occasion.

16:17.601 --> 16:22.105
Well, what if the occasion were
a simple family party?

16:22.272 --> 16:24.816
I think I have just the thing.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.404
There they are.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.493
George?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.415
-Shopping?
-Stuart?

16:40.582 --> 16:43.292
-Everything all right in there?
-Don't come in.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.753
Shy.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.174
How do I look?

16:50.342 --> 16:53.344
-Fantastic. l hardly recognize you.
-Very smart.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.096
And you look just like a Little.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.557
I do?

16:57.933 --> 16:59.392
Good.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.270
I was worried
I was gonna look just like Ben.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.738
Hi, auntie.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.157
-Crenshaw!
-Frederick!

17:15.325 --> 17:16.617
Little high, Little low.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.619
Little hey, Little ho!

17:20.622 --> 17:22.790
We come bearing gifts
for young Stuart.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.959
Yes, where is my new nephew?

17:25.127 --> 17:27.377
The Little family's getting
bigger and bigger.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.423
Boy.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.011
That's a lot of Littles.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.388
Uncle Crenshaw!

17:41.852 --> 17:43.561
There's my favorite little nephew.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.980
You can't say that anymore,
Crenshaw.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.858
Right. Now we have two
favorite little nephews.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.403
-Where is the lad?
-He has a lot of gifts to open.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.489
Are any of those for me?

17:57.659 --> 18:01.204
You see, George, well, we thought--

18:01.371 --> 18:03.372
That's exact--
We thought that later--

18:03.540 --> 18:07.752
Attention, everybody.
We'd like to introduce you to someone.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.921
This is Stuart.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.848
Hello, everyone.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.314
-He's a-- A--
-Adorable!

18:28.482 --> 18:30.358
-Adorable.
-Yeah, that's right.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.235
I couldn't think of the word.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.573
Oh, Stuart, look.

18:37.741 --> 18:41.536
Look at that.
This is a real Schmelling.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.372
-Those are the best kind.
-You know what they say:

18:44.540 --> 18:47.708
-"If it ain't Schmelling...."
-"It ain't bowling."

18:48.377 --> 18:49.544
Look here, Stuart.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.714
Climb on up here, son.
Plant your caboose right up here.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.307
He may have to grow into it.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.269
I think he's grown a little
since we've been here.

19:06.436 --> 19:11.023
That's what happened to me.
One summer, l just shot right up.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.902
May I say something?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.906
In the orphanage,
we used to tell fairy tales...

19:19.074 --> 19:22.326
...of finding our families
and having a party like this.

19:22.494 --> 19:26.622
A party with cakes and presents
and all varieties of meat loaf.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.793
A party with a big family who came
from far away just to wish us well.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.588
I don't know much about families...

19:33.755 --> 19:36.591
...but this must be the nicest family
in the world, I think.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.760
So I just wanted to thank
each of you.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.221
Because now I know...

19:42.389 --> 19:44.182
...fairy tales are real.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.391
Oh, Stuart.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.977
Fairy tales are real?

19:49.062 --> 19:51.689
I think I'm gonna cough up a fur ball.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.151
Now it's time
for the best present of all.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.779
-It's something for you and George.
-George.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.325
Stand next to Stuart.

20:02.492 --> 20:07.330
This is something that gave your father
and me hours of enjoyment...

20:07.497 --> 20:10.791
...when we were young brothers
just like you and Stuart.

20:15.464 --> 20:20.301
This ball belonged
to your great-great-grandfather...

20:20.969 --> 20:23.095
...Jedediah Little.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.185
Remember, Frederick, those
long summer days playing catch?

20:29.353 --> 20:33.147
Why don't you take your brother outside
and toss around the old horsehide?

20:33.315 --> 20:35.191
Yeah, what do you say, George?
You ready?

20:35.359 --> 20:37.235
Are you all nuts?

20:37.402 --> 20:39.487
Bicycles and bowling balls?

20:40.239 --> 20:44.158
How will he toss a baseball?
How will he do any of those things?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.702
He's not my brother. He's a mouse.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.834
-Time to go.
-Excellent idea.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.603
What, what, what? Where?

21:14.982 --> 21:18.776
Stuart. Did I hurt you?
What's the matter?

21:20.070 --> 21:24.031
I just wanted to ask you something,
but you were already asleep.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.617
-What did you want to ask us?
-About my real family.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.869
You know, the ones I look like.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.165
He hates us.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.918
We've never been hated before.

21:36.086 --> 21:39.046
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's not that at all.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.382
It's just that...

21:42.342 --> 21:44.010
...something's missing.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.971
I feel an empty space inside me...

21:47.139 --> 21:49.390
...and l just want to know
what was there before.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.059
You have an empty space.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.478
That's so sad.

21:54.646 --> 21:59.233
Oh, dear. I hope I haven't left you
dismayed and disappointed.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.152
-No, no, no.
-No. No.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.154
We don't feel dismayed
and disappointed.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.072
Not at all.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.992
-Are you sure?
-We're certain, Stuart.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.747
And if you want us to,
we'll find out about your real parents.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.834
Well, good night, then.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.512
It's out of the question.
And it's against the rules.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.308
Besides, it's very hard
to track mouse families.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.852
They're not very good
with paperwork.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.521
But he has an empty space.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.816
Are there problems with Stuart?

22:41.443 --> 22:44.487
-Problem--? No, not at all.
-No, no.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.281
-Well, there's been a few....
-Difficulties.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.532
Difficulties?

22:48.950 --> 22:52.828
Well, like the cat trying to eat him
when we first brought him home.

22:52.996 --> 22:56.123
He spat the boy right out, of course,
in one heck of a jiffy.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.294
Mrs. Keeper...

23:01.546 --> 23:03.798
...he wants to know about his family.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.217
Any child would have questions
about that.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.804
Yes.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.613
Hey, Snow?

23:28.198 --> 23:30.908
I know that you and I
got off on the wrong paw.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.953
I just wanted to see
if we could start out fresh.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.830
You know? Clean slate.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.582
What do you say?
Wanna be friends?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.044
No.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.339
Okay then.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.677
He's playing with my head.
He's trying to psych me out.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.345
Sick little rodent.

23:51.513 --> 23:55.057
Hey, Snow, let me in! l'm starving!
What's in the dish today?

23:55.225 --> 23:57.226
Oh, no. Monty the Mouth.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.812
He sees Stuart,
it'll be all over the neighborhood.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.272
Let me in.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.940
Go away. There's no food here.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.233
Please.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.988
I'm not picky,
as long as it ain't meat loaf.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.574
That stuff gives me gas
something awful.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.367
Sorry, it's meat loaf.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.620
Oh, well. Beggars can't be choosers.
Load me up and light a match.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.206
Oh, no, no, Monty.
Stop. You don't wanna do that.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.959
Why? I eat from garbage cans,
drink from public toilets.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.713
-Like a little gas is gonna bother me.
-No, wait. Don't!

24:25.881 --> 24:28.382
Oh, great.
What am I gonna tell him now?

24:30.385 --> 24:32.470
Monty, l can explain.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.306
-I-- He's a--
-Explain what?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.309
Explain that you should
stuff your face.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.352
Oh, thanks.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.524
Gee, I don't wanna rush you,
but you really have to leave.

24:45.692 --> 24:49.570
The Littles are due back, and they
don't like strange cats in the house.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.572
Not that you're strange.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.743
Hey, Snow, what's wrong with you?

24:56.244 --> 24:57.244
Nothing.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.413
You know,
you're the one acting strange.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.457
What is it? Worms? Fleas?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.334
Yeah, you look pale.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.922
-Maybe you should see a vet.
-A vet? What a swell idea.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.257
Do you know anybody?
I'm not so happy with mine.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.760
He makes us wait
and his hands are always cold.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.262
-What was that?
-What was that what?

25:15.430 --> 25:17.431
What was that--? What?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.393
Well, I hate to eat and run.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.646
No, no, please. By all means, run.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.731
Run like the wind!

25:27.692 --> 25:28.943
That was gross.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.030
Hey, Snow,
I almost forgot to thank you.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.907
Hey.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.536
What the...?

25:39.829 --> 25:40.913
Oh, no.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.297
Oh, my pants.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.634
Say, they're really putting
some wild prizes in there, huh, Monty?

25:56.805 --> 25:59.515
Oh, hello.
You must be a friend of Snowbell's.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.808
I'm Stuart.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.561
-Aren't you gonna run?
-Why?

26:03.728 --> 26:05.396
Because you're a mouse.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.481
I'm not just a mouse.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.817
I'm also a member of this family.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.154
A mouse with a pet cat.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.535
A mouse with a pet cat!

26:20.662 --> 26:23.497
I guess that is pretty funny.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.251
Pretty funny?
I'm gonna wet my fur!

26:27.419 --> 26:30.045
A mouse with a pet cat!

26:30.839 --> 26:32.840
Your new little master.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.342
Wait till the boys hear about this.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.262
The humiliation.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.891
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Oh, dear.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.269
Come back here!

27:06.708 --> 27:09.418
All right. No more Mr. Nice-Kitty.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.378
You!

27:14.049 --> 27:15.883
Get out of there.
You can't go in there.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.552
That's George's room.
Come back. Come on out.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.264
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna
show you something. Come on.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.784
What are you doing here?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.747
I just thought I'd drop in.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.417
Did you build all these?

27:50.585 --> 27:52.503
Me and my dad.

27:52.671 --> 27:56.924
Wow, this is incredible.
It's like being in a real live Western.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.717
Howdy, partner.

27:58.885 --> 28:02.971
Draw, you lily-livered, yellow-bellied
son of a one-eyed prairie dog.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.435
I'm trying to concentrate.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.313
Sorry.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.985
Is that a train?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.530
What's it look like, picklehead?

28:19.989 --> 28:24.034
Could we play with it?
Please, please, please?

28:29.207 --> 28:32.126
Help! Somebody help me!

28:34.462 --> 28:37.673
Help! Please! Somebody help me!

28:44.973 --> 28:47.349
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-You're crazy.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.394
Hey, I have an idea.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.826
Hop in.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.834
Wow, a roadster.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.420
Go ahead, check it out.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.179
Stuart, what's wrong?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.598
Nothing.

29:28.183 --> 29:32.644
It's just it's the first time I've fit in
since I got here.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.565
What's that?

29:38.359 --> 29:39.943
Oh, that.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.738
That's the Wasp.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.537
She is beautiful.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.874
-Yeah, but she's not finished.
-When are you gonna finish it?

29:54.042 --> 29:57.961
Well, me and my dad were building her,
but I decided to stop.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.296
How come?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.465
I'm too little for a race like that.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.884
Little? You're not little.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.469
Well, not to me.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.180
Stuart, you've never seen
one of these races.

30:08.348 --> 30:11.225
There's hundreds of people there.
Everybody from school.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.602
I mean...

30:14.062 --> 30:15.604
...what if you lost?

30:17.398 --> 30:19.441
Well, at least
you'll have been somewhere.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.571
Come on, George.
What do you say?

30:26.115 --> 30:27.407
Let's get started.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.202
You know...

30:30.370 --> 30:32.412
...I'm not really sure l want a brother.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.250
Well, how about a friend?

30:37.418 --> 30:40.295
I guess I can always use a friend.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.632
-George?
-Yes, Dad?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.133
Have you seen Stuart?

30:45.301 --> 30:47.302
He's down here with me.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.638
What are you doing to him?

30:51.057 --> 30:53.350
He's helping me finish the Wasp.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.604
That's-- That's wonderful, son.

30:57.772 --> 30:58.897
That's terrific.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.316
Can't race her like this.
Right, George?

31:01.484 --> 31:03.610
-Right.
-Well, when's the next race?

31:03.778 --> 31:05.779
-Two days.
-Two days?

31:05.947 --> 31:07.447
We'll be ready.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.075
-Well, how about we all go together?
-Wonderful idea.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.619
-That would be great.
-All of us together.

31:12.787 --> 31:17.958
The whole family.

31:20.128 --> 31:23.255
I'm telling you, Snowy,
this guy can fix anything.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.464
But they're alley cats.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.551
They're mean, they're vicious,
they're all hopped up on catnip.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.762
Quit being such a scaredy-cat.
You wanna get rid of the mouse?

31:30.930 --> 31:32.848
-Of course I do.
-All right, then.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.975
Hey! Hey, Smokey!

31:35.143 --> 31:37.853
Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.062
What is it now?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.982
Well, my friend Snowbell here
needs a favor.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.692
Snowbell?

31:43.985 --> 31:45.527
Now there's a manly name.

31:45.695 --> 31:49.156
Yeah. You see, sir,
I've got this mouse at home l can't eat.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.741
Sensitive stomach?

31:51.242 --> 31:55.662
No. I can't eat him because
he's a member of the family.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.706
A mouse with a pet cat?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.499
Isn't that funny?

32:00.209 --> 32:01.501
That's not funny.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.087
That's sick.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.506
A cat can't have a rodent
for a master.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.718
What's this world coming to?
It's against the laws of nature.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.721
Word of this gets out,
it'll be bad for cats all over.

32:12.889 --> 32:16.099
-So you think you can help me?
-Consider it done.

32:16.684 --> 32:20.020
Did you hear that, Monty?
Thank you, Mr. Smokey, sir.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.189
I'll never forget this. Really.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.858
Don't worry, Tinker Bell.
I'm all over it.

32:26.152 --> 32:29.112
Tinker Bell!
He called me Tinker Bell.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.365
-You're a funny guy.
-Yeah, whatever.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.034
Jeez, house cats.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.203
Are you sure
he'll keep this hush-hush?

32:36.371 --> 32:39.039
You kidding? Cat's got his tongue.
Get it?

32:39.207 --> 32:41.208
Cat's got his tongue,
because he's a cat.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.377
-Shut up.
-Okay.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.298
Ahoy, fellow yachtsmen!

32:48.466 --> 32:53.553
And welcome, everyone, to the
92nd annual Central Park Boat Race...

32:53.721 --> 32:57.808
...undoubtedly model racing's
most prestigious event.

32:57.976 --> 33:01.103
Children from all over New York
gather here every year...

33:01.270 --> 33:03.230
...to see whose boat will prevail.

33:03.606 --> 33:07.734
Who will win the race
and take home the magnificent trophy?

33:09.237 --> 33:11.738
-Anchor up?
-Check.

33:11.906 --> 33:14.616
-Stays all battened?
-Check.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.952
-Rudder?
-Check.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.246
-Sail?
-Check.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.915
-Third line?
-Check.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.291
They're doing checks.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.752
So, George, Stuart,
would you like a hot dog?

33:25.920 --> 33:27.087
-Check.
-Check.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.798
And from Manhattan's
Upper West Side...

33:29.966 --> 33:32.551
...the Wasp,
piloted by George Little.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.554
Well, everything appears
to be in shipshape.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.099
But to be on the safe side,
I better check the hull for leaks.

33:39.267 --> 33:43.270
--the Lillian B. Womrat,
piloted by Anton....

33:43.438 --> 33:45.439
Oh, no. Anton.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.777
Gee, George, what did you do,
get that out of a cereal box?

33:52.196 --> 33:53.947
I'm glad you're here, George.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.283
Someone's gotta finish last.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.372
I don't like that child.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.208
All set to get under way.

34:13.509 --> 34:17.471
It's time to get those boats in the water
and grab your remote.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.473
Stuart, could you get the remote?

34:19.639 --> 34:20.806
Aye, aye, captain.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.366
Doesn't she look great?

34:44.998 --> 34:46.750
Are you okay?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.543
-Maybe we should go home.
-Why?

34:49.712 --> 34:51.838
I'm not wearing my lucky underwear.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.882
You don't have lucky underwear.

34:54.050 --> 34:57.844
Well, maybe we should get some
and then come back for another race.

35:06.270 --> 35:11.525
George, listen, l know how worried
you are about losing, believe me.

35:11.692 --> 35:14.402
But you know what we say?
The thing that really matters...

35:14.570 --> 35:17.405
...is to never stop trying. Okay?

35:17.573 --> 35:20.200
-Okay.
-That's the spirit.

35:23.412 --> 35:26.706
Everyone to your places.
The race is about to start.

35:30.753 --> 35:31.878
Where's Stuart?

35:34.298 --> 35:36.216
Look out, sir!

35:39.178 --> 35:41.429
One minute to race time,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.766
-Stuart, are you hurt?
-Stuart, what happened?

35:44.934 --> 35:47.561
It was completely my fault.
I couldn't grip it.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.563
Nice going, Captain Loser.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.276
All set to get under way.

35:54.443 --> 35:56.444
All boats on the starting line
immediately.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.238
George, wait.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.576
Oh, honey.
Everything will be all right.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.911
No, it won't.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.125
Maybe we could fix it, huh?
A little glue. Who'll know?

36:10.585 --> 36:12.252
Mom.

36:12.962 --> 36:17.757
This is awful. Our first family outing.
I ruined everything.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.636
Well, you know, Stuart...

36:22.138 --> 36:23.680
...these things happen.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.850
But what about George?

36:30.104 --> 36:31.188
I'll be right back.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.531
George, you know what?

36:41.699 --> 36:43.450
Just because
we can't be in the race...

36:43.618 --> 36:46.203
...doesn't mean our family outing
has to be ruined.

36:46.370 --> 36:51.458
-I really think--
-All boats to your marks. Ready and:

36:54.045 --> 36:55.170
And the race is on.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.797
I think we should just go home.

36:57.965 --> 37:02.135
The sails are full and--
There's a mouse on that boat?

37:03.346 --> 37:05.180
Stuart!

37:08.059 --> 37:10.143
-George!
-Stuart!

37:11.812 --> 37:14.856
-What are you doing?
-Sailing. I hope.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.358
Come back here this minute.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.984
-I can't.
-Why not?

37:18.152 --> 37:19.653
I don't know how!

37:19.820 --> 37:22.948
The competitors are jockeying
for position.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.242
Frederick, l don't like this one bit.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.160
Your mother doesn't like this one bit.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.204
I'm okay, Mom!

37:29.372 --> 37:30.705
Go, Stuart!

37:30.873 --> 37:34.000
-Tighten the mainsail!
-What's a mainsail?

37:34.627 --> 37:37.337
Once the boats
get past the footbridge....

37:40.174 --> 37:41.841
Move!

37:42.843 --> 37:44.302
Come on, Stuart!

37:44.470 --> 37:47.514
-Gee, George, you all done crying?
-Yeah.

37:47.682 --> 37:51.017
-You all done being a jerk?
-No.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.144
Don't worry, George!
I won't let you down!

37:53.312 --> 37:56.856
Away the boats are sailing....

38:09.287 --> 38:10.704
Frederick, what if he falls?

38:10.871 --> 38:13.957
Remember,
he's quite a fine swimmer.

38:33.894 --> 38:36.146
Hey, that's cheating.
You can't do that.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.815
Well, I just did.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.572
Oh, dear.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.693
-What is he doing?
-I think he's hiking out.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.959
Hope that mouse can swim.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.465
-The Wasp is gonna take the lead.
-Stuart, look out!

39:57.478 --> 39:59.396
That can't be good.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.731
Look what that stupid mouse did
to my sail!

40:01.899 --> 40:03.483
He's not a stupid mouse.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.902
You're right. He's a stupid rat.

40:15.079 --> 40:18.331
-Hey, hey, hey, come on.
-Get off me. Get off!

40:18.958 --> 40:20.166
George.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.007
Stuart!

40:40.855 --> 40:42.605
Something's wrong.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.358
What's happening?

41:05.296 --> 41:08.923
Yeah!

41:20.144 --> 41:22.937
Who is that mouse, anyway?

41:23.105 --> 41:26.232
That's no mouse.
That's my brother.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.957
Little high, Little low!

41:43.125 --> 41:45.001
Little hey, Little ho!

41:48.506 --> 41:51.090
Oh, Frederick, look at them.

41:56.138 --> 41:57.180
You know what?

41:57.890 --> 41:59.599
This calls for a picture.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.108
What's wrong?

42:09.318 --> 42:11.694
Well, it's just...

42:13.322 --> 42:14.948
...you four look great together.

42:17.326 --> 42:19.869
This is the happiest moment
of my life.

42:20.037 --> 42:23.498
I feel 1 0 inches tall.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.004
I'll get that.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.510
-Mr. Little.
-Yes?

42:35.678 --> 42:37.512
Down here.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.931
Very sorry to disturb you
at your lovely abode.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.141
I hope we're not intruding.

42:42.309 --> 42:45.603
My name's Reginald Stout.
This is my wife, Camille.

42:45.771 --> 42:47.480
An extreme pleasure.

42:47.648 --> 42:49.482
We're looking for Stuart.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.526
Are you friends of his?

42:51.694 --> 42:53.945
Well, not exactly.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.573
-Fellow yachtsmen?
-Guess again.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.491
Reggie, just tell them.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.493
We're his parents.

43:12.464 --> 43:15.341
Reggie, stop it!

43:19.847 --> 43:22.432
It's so good to see you again, Stuart.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.518
There's so much
we have to catch up on.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.105
Why didn't you want me?

43:29.273 --> 43:32.066
Stuart, it shames me to say this...

43:32.234 --> 43:34.569
...but you weren't born
into a prosperous home.

43:34.737 --> 43:38.031
That's right.
We couldn't feed you, dear.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.575
Couldn't feed him?
How much could he eat?

43:40.743 --> 43:42.035
George, please.

43:42.202 --> 43:46.205
Letting you go was the toughest
choice we ever made.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.374
-It was?
-Yes.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.002
But now we can be a family again.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.047
Absolutely. Are these salted?

43:56.342 --> 43:59.260
Dear. The children.

43:59.428 --> 44:03.556
Yeah. George, Stuart, l think
we need to talk to the Stouts alone.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.271
Don't worry.
Mom and Dad will take care of it.

44:15.569 --> 44:18.237
-I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
-Right.

44:18.405 --> 44:21.199
Stuart can't leave with you. He's--

44:21.367 --> 44:22.950
-One of the family.
-Exactly.

44:23.118 --> 44:26.746
You may feel like he's family,
but he'll never really be family.

44:26.914 --> 44:31.125
You may not realize it,
but I'm sure he does.

44:31.293 --> 44:33.753
There's something
you'll never be able to give him...

44:33.921 --> 44:35.546
...because you're human.
No offense.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.091
It's a place that
you'll never be able to fill.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.594
An empty space.

44:43.597 --> 44:44.931
Mom...

44:45.724 --> 44:48.101
...Dad, you want me to leave?

44:48.268 --> 44:52.105
-No.
-Dear, we just want what's best for you.

44:52.272 --> 44:54.107
But Stuart lives here.

44:54.274 --> 44:56.651
George, come on.
This is hard for all of us.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.194
This stinks!

45:04.660 --> 45:06.035
I don't understand.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.246
I thought I was in a fairy tale.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.665
Fairy tales are made-up stories,
Stuart.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.835
This is real.
This is about where you belong.

45:14.002 --> 45:17.422
Please, come home, Stuart.
Your real home.

45:17.589 --> 45:20.883
You're gonna love it, son.
We live on a golf course.

45:21.051 --> 45:24.011
-We look right over the main fairway.
-It's beautiful.

45:24.179 --> 45:26.013
Beautiful.

45:28.308 --> 45:31.060
Hey, taxi!

45:31.937 --> 45:34.647
What's a mouse have to do
to get a cab in this city?

45:43.699 --> 45:45.825
You'll speak to George for me,
won't you?

45:46.201 --> 45:49.203
I'd hate to say goodbye
to a basement door.

45:50.956 --> 45:52.248
Of course.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.833
Taxi!

45:54.501 --> 45:56.836
Yo, yo, taxi!

45:59.214 --> 46:00.423
Time to go, Stuart.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.306
Well, goodbye.

46:17.065 --> 46:18.816
We love you.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.863
I love you, too, Mom.

46:25.407 --> 46:27.033
Mrs. Little.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.903
Boy, that looks heavy.
You need some help with that?

47:04.071 --> 47:05.571
Camille?

47:07.741 --> 47:09.992
Frederick, let's do something.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.244
What?

47:11.411 --> 47:14.997
Let's just make them go away.
We're bigger than they are.

47:15.165 --> 47:18.167
We'll say, "Go, shoo."
We'll scare their little whiskers off.

47:18.335 --> 47:20.378
Eleanor, you're not being rational.

47:20.546 --> 47:21.671
Rational, shmational.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.924
Something about this is not right.
I just know it.

47:25.092 --> 47:28.094
Look at them. They just fit.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.806
So what? l have shoes that fit
and I hate them. As Stuart's mother--

47:31.974 --> 47:33.516
But you're not.

47:34.142 --> 47:36.018
She is.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.189
Stuart!

47:42.943 --> 47:44.277
Wait!

47:44.945 --> 47:46.529
George?

47:50.784 --> 47:52.618
I want you to have this.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.453
Oh, George.

47:54.913 --> 47:58.791
Not the roadster, George.
You love this car. I couldn't.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.293
I want you to.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.670
Thanks, George.

48:02.838 --> 48:04.797
I wish you didn't have to go.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.757
I'm gonna miss you.

48:06.925 --> 48:09.302
I'll miss you, too, George.

49:28.382 --> 49:32.385
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

49:32.552 --> 49:34.553
That's amore

49:35.389 --> 49:36.847
Sing with me, Stuie!

49:37.015 --> 49:41.936
When the world seems to shine
Like you had too much wine

49:45.899 --> 49:49.527
Tell me your favorite foods
so I can fix them for you, Stuart.

49:49.695 --> 49:51.320
What for? You can't cook.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.656
But I can learn. We're a family now.

49:53.824 --> 49:56.242
There's a lot of adjustments
we'll all have to make.

49:58.328 --> 50:00.246
-Right, Reggie?
-Right, Camille.

50:01.331 --> 50:03.416
Here we are, Stuie, the family home.

50:03.583 --> 50:05.251
The family home.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.378
Mind you,
this is just our summer place.

50:07.546 --> 50:10.172
Winter, we live in a crawlspace
above a delicatessen.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.424
You like corned beef?

50:11.591 --> 50:13.592
-How's it prepared?
-Prepared?

50:13.760 --> 50:16.846
It drops out of a fat guy's mouth,
we grab it and run.

50:17.014 --> 50:22.268
-Sounds like an acquired taste.
-Acquired taste? l love this kid!

50:22.436 --> 50:24.437
Your new bedroom, Stuart.

50:24.604 --> 50:26.522
We hope you like it.

50:28.608 --> 50:32.111
Well, good night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

50:34.990 --> 50:38.993
Hey, I'm serious about those bedbugs.
Keep an eye open.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.834
It's very kind of you
to check on us like this.

51:29.002 --> 51:32.880
Actually, I had something to tell you.

51:33.048 --> 51:36.342
But first, how are things going?

51:36.510 --> 51:39.220
-Oh, it's been difficult.
-Difficult?

51:39.387 --> 51:42.306
-No, very difficult.
-Very difficult?

51:42.474 --> 51:44.725
-Worse.
-Worse than very difficult?

51:46.144 --> 51:48.521
-Yes, it's been almost--
-Unbearable.

51:48.688 --> 51:50.606
Just the word I was looking for.

51:50.774 --> 51:53.692
Oh, maybe
this isn't a good time, then.

51:53.860 --> 51:56.612
You see, I came over
to give you some news.

51:56.780 --> 51:57.905
What type of news?

52:00.033 --> 52:02.201
-They had an accident.
-Who?

52:02.369 --> 52:03.536
Stuart's parents.

52:04.871 --> 52:07.123
Oh, my goodness.
Well, are they all right?

52:07.290 --> 52:10.126
No. They didn't make it.

52:10.293 --> 52:13.045
-Oh, no. Oh, my--
-What happened?

52:13.213 --> 52:17.591
Well, apparently they were grocery
shopping, canned-food aisle.

52:17.759 --> 52:21.053
There was an unsteady pyramid of cans
and it collapsed.

52:21.221 --> 52:23.264
Took three bag boys to dig them out.

52:23.431 --> 52:25.975
They had to identify them
by their dental records.

52:26.351 --> 52:28.227
Oh, how horrible!

52:28.895 --> 52:31.856
Cream of mushroom soup.
Two-for-one sale.

52:32.023 --> 52:34.150
That's a very heavy soup.

52:34.776 --> 52:36.235
How is Stuart taking it?

52:36.403 --> 52:37.736
Well, he doesn't know.

52:38.488 --> 52:39.738
You mean no one's told him?

52:40.115 --> 52:42.116
Does he have to know?

52:42.284 --> 52:45.744
Six months after they don't come back,
won't he wonder where they went?

52:45.912 --> 52:48.122
But they've been gone for years.

52:48.290 --> 52:51.167
Years? How is that possible?

52:51.334 --> 52:54.962
Because they died years ago.
Which part is confusing you?

52:55.130 --> 52:57.590
Stuart's parents took him away
three days ago.

52:57.757 --> 53:00.134
Three days ago?
Stuart's parents died...

53:00.302 --> 53:03.470
...in a tragic cream-mushroom-soup
incident years ago.

53:03.638 --> 53:04.930
I just told you.

53:05.557 --> 53:08.058
Dear, we have to take this up
with the police.

53:20.697 --> 53:21.906
-Mrs. Little?
-Yes.

53:22.073 --> 53:25.326
I'm Detective Sherman.
This is my partner, Detective Allen.

53:25.493 --> 53:28.537
-We understand your son is missing.
-Thank you for coming.

53:28.705 --> 53:31.373
They know about the Stouts!
They know about the Stouts!

53:31.541 --> 53:34.960
-The jig is up! What are we gonna do?
-Hey, get ahold of yourself.

53:35.128 --> 53:38.130
I'm in big--!
I'm in deep poopy-do!

53:38.298 --> 53:41.133
Calm down, calm down.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

53:41.301 --> 53:42.718
All we need is a new plan.

53:42.886 --> 53:46.305
We do what we should've done
in the first place.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.141
-We scratch him out.
-Scratch him out?

53:49.309 --> 53:51.018
But, Smokey,
the police are involved.

53:51.186 --> 53:53.062
I don't wanna get kicked out
of my house.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.189
I'm not a street cat.
I'm a house cat.

53:55.357 --> 53:58.984
I don't wanna lose my furry basket or
my tinkle ball that I push with my nose.

53:59.152 --> 54:01.153
No, buddy, pull yourself together.

54:01.321 --> 54:02.738
It's settled.

54:02.906 --> 54:06.700
Stuart Little gets scratched tonight.

54:20.715 --> 54:23.509
Okay. Very good.

54:23.677 --> 54:27.221
Mr. and Mrs. Little,
you'll have to come downtown.

54:33.603 --> 54:37.356
Detective Sherman, what are
our chances of seeing Stuart again?

54:38.358 --> 54:39.566
You want it straight?

54:41.444 --> 54:43.070
-No.
-Absolutely not.

54:43.238 --> 54:46.198
Well, in that case...

54:46.366 --> 54:49.368
...Stuart's probably home right now
waiting for you.

54:53.039 --> 54:55.708
Maybe we should hear it
a little straighter than that.

54:55.917 --> 54:59.295
Okay. In a case like this...

54:59.462 --> 55:02.548
...if the kidnappers have not called
by now...

55:02.716 --> 55:05.426
...then they're not interested
in money.

55:05.593 --> 55:07.720
-What are they interested in?
-Kicks.

55:07.887 --> 55:08.929
Exactly.

55:09.097 --> 55:11.181
It's my guess these two sickos...

55:11.349 --> 55:15.311
...are on some kind of cross-country
mouse-killing spree.

55:15.478 --> 55:17.771
-Oh, no.
-Well, thank you.

55:17.939 --> 55:21.025
-Yes, you can kiss this boy goodbye.
-Thank you, detective.

55:21.192 --> 55:23.986
It's over. The things l've seen.

55:24.154 --> 55:27.072
Phil, where is that book
on the grisly photos?

55:27.240 --> 55:30.117
-Believe me, you don't want to see this.
-No. Well--

55:30.285 --> 55:31.910
It'll only take a second.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.459
Right off the bat. Look at this one.

55:38.626 --> 55:40.502
This one kept me awake for weeks.

55:58.438 --> 55:59.938
What did they want?

56:02.609 --> 56:03.776
Where's the boy?

56:04.319 --> 56:06.153
Oh, no.

56:09.949 --> 56:11.950
Stuart, wake up.

56:12.285 --> 56:14.495
-Get dressed.
-Why?

56:14.662 --> 56:17.122
-We're taking you for a ride.
-Where are we going?

56:17.290 --> 56:19.291
Friends of ours have gathered
to meet you.

56:19.459 --> 56:22.127
A gathering? What should I wear?

56:22.295 --> 56:24.213
It doesn't matter. Wear anything.

56:24.381 --> 56:27.841
-Is it formal?
-Just put something on!

56:29.719 --> 56:31.804
Why is Mom crying?

56:32.847 --> 56:37.309
Mom? I'm not angry at you
for putting me up for adoption.

56:38.728 --> 56:43.107
And now that l'm a Stout again,
I'll always be here to take care of you.

56:45.193 --> 56:47.319
Because that's what families do.

56:47.487 --> 56:49.822
Mom, they take care of each other.

56:56.079 --> 56:57.704
Tell him the truth!

56:59.332 --> 57:01.083
You made a deal with a cat?

57:01.251 --> 57:03.836
He cornered us at the bottom
of a cup on the fifth hole.

57:04.003 --> 57:05.003
It was curtains.

57:05.171 --> 57:08.173
-So you agreed to pose as my parents?
-Yes.

57:08.341 --> 57:11.218
-You lied and cheated?
-Yes.

57:11.386 --> 57:15.013
You took me away from the Littles
just when we were all so happy?

57:15.181 --> 57:16.807
-Yes!
-Yes!

57:16.975 --> 57:18.559
That's wonderful.

57:19.185 --> 57:21.019
I think you missed something.

57:21.187 --> 57:24.982
That's why I've been feeling so sad.
That's why I keep thinking of them.

57:25.150 --> 57:28.026
I'm not a Stout. I'm a Little.

57:28.194 --> 57:33.991
I'm Stuart Little!

57:35.368 --> 57:38.120
Stuart, please.
You have to listen to us.

57:38.288 --> 57:41.206
The cats have decided you're too risky
to keep around anymore.

57:41.374 --> 57:43.375
They ordered us
to hand you over to them.

57:44.377 --> 57:47.045
As your fake father,
I order you to run.

57:47.213 --> 57:48.547
-I'll go home.
-Home?

57:48.715 --> 57:52.759
That's miles from here. lt's dark out.
Every cat in the city is looking for you.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.803
Besides, you could get lost.

57:54.971 --> 57:57.055
No. No, l can't.

57:57.223 --> 57:59.975
Every Little in the world
can find the Little house.

58:03.229 --> 58:06.565
Bye, fake father!
Goodbye, fake mother!

58:06.733 --> 58:09.568
-Goodbye, fake son.
-Goodbye, Stuart.

58:10.945 --> 58:12.571
I'm gonna miss that boy.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.073
I'm gonna miss that car.

58:21.456 --> 58:24.124
-George.
-Well, l think we have to--

58:24.292 --> 58:26.251
-Tell him.
-Yeah.

58:31.090 --> 58:34.426
-Who has the glue?
-I'm the glue man.

58:36.262 --> 58:38.096
-What's going on?
-We're making posters.

58:38.264 --> 58:40.349
-We'll put them up all over the city.
-Right.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.101
They describe Stuart
and offer a reward.

58:43.269 --> 58:44.436
Isn't it wonderful?

58:44.604 --> 58:47.356
It was all George's idea.

58:51.986 --> 58:53.403
George.

58:55.448 --> 58:57.366
Never stop trying. Right, Dad?

58:58.409 --> 59:01.453
Listen,
I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.

59:01.621 --> 59:02.955
Why not?

59:05.124 --> 59:06.542
Frederick.

59:08.836 --> 59:12.297
Because there's no picture.
We need a picture of Stuart.

59:12.465 --> 59:13.799
The family photo.

59:26.646 --> 59:28.730
Smokey. Hey, Smokey!

59:28.898 --> 59:31.900
-Keep it down.
-Hey, it's me, Lucky.

59:32.068 --> 59:35.821
I just heard from the Brooklyn cats.
Bad news. The Stouts squealed.

59:35.989 --> 59:37.656
I knew those mice were rats.

59:37.824 --> 59:39.950
The kid's on his way home.
What do we do?

59:40.118 --> 59:42.953
No problem. He's gotta go
through the park, right?

59:43.121 --> 59:45.372
Let's meet him
and have ourselves a little picnic.

59:45.540 --> 59:50.919
-Oh, great. I'll bring herring.
-Hey, moron! The mouse is the picnic.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.570
Every Little in the world
can find the Little house.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:01.740
I'm a Little. I'm a Little.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.742
I'm a little lost.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.096
How you doing?

01:01:24.263 --> 01:01:25.514
You must be Stuart.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:29.101
Actually, I must be going.

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:30.519
What's your hurry, Murray?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:34.272
Yeah, where are you going, Murray--?
Stuart? What's his name?

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.360
Hey! Come back here, you little rat!

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.279
-He's getting away!
-Lucky, Red, get him. Come on!

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:44.366
-Going backwards!
-He's a hell of a driver!

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.118
-Go, go, go!
-Oh, cool. We got him.

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.121
-I got him, Smokey.
-No, I got him.

01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:52.457
The only thing you guys got
are big mouths.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.959
So shut up and run.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.217
-Geronimo!
-Banzai!

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:04.553
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.638
-We got him now.
-Come on.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:15.397
-I got him! I got him!
-Get him, Red, get him!

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.869
-I hope he runs out of gas.
-I hope you do.

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:31.037
-Run in the back.
-I can't help it.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:32.539
I have a nervous stomach.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.375
And l have an empty stomach!
Now get that mouse.

01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:50.724
Did you see that? Damn.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.851
Nobody could've survived that.
Right, boss?

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.228
Yeah, the mouse is sleeping
with the fishes.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.814
Long, wet nap.

01:02:58.649 --> 01:03:01.401
Hey, the sewer rat's alive! After him!

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.029
No way. I'm a cat. l don't do water.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.280
All right, Red, you go.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:07.949
Oh, no.
You want to do water, hire a spaniel.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:12.454
I don't believe this. What are you guys,
a bunch of house cats?

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.925
Oh, no.

01:03:25.092 --> 01:03:27.260
Oh, no! Oh, dear.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.388
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:43.443
Crenshaw, Tina, Uncle Stretch,
you go uptown.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.570
Cover as many streets as you can.

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:49.741
Edgar, Beatrice, Spencer,
you take downtown.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:53.286
-Every side street and back alley.
-All right.

01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:54.913
Estelle.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.250
You better go with them.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.253
Where do l go?

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.880
You come with us.
We're gonna circle the park.

01:04:09.053 --> 01:04:10.387
Okay.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:17.936
You're making a lot of stops.

01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:26.611
I made it.

01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:30.699
I can't believe it. l'm home.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:31.950
Mom! Dad!

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.869
I'm coming!

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:49.634
Mom, Dad, George!

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:53.305
It's me, Stuart! l'm back!

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.641
Mom!

01:04:57.518 --> 01:04:59.978
Dad! George!

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.479
Where is everybody?

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:03.315
There's nobody else here.

01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:06.192
It's just you and me, kid.

01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:07.819
Where'd they go?

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:10.155
Movies, I think.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.157
-Movies?
-Oh, yeah.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.910
Ever since you left,
it's just movies, parties...

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.621
...roller-skating, amusement parks.

01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:19.998
They're having the time
of their lives.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.709
-They are?
-Oh, sure.

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:27.881
Stuart, I hate to have to tell you this,
but they're celebrating.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:29.758
Celebrating what?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.594
-Can't you guess?
-No.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.430
They were just so happy
to get rid of you.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:39.351
That's a lie. I don't believe that.

01:05:39.518 --> 01:05:41.394
Oh, boy.

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:45.607
I wish I could spare you this.
This is gonna break your little heart.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.192
Look up there.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.277
At what?

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.239
See for yourself.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.224
They did that right after you left.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:22.978
Mrs. Little said, "Who wants to look
at that face anymore?"

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.105
-She did?
-Yeah.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:29.234
-And George?
-She gave it to him, and he tore it up.

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:31.236
-He did?
-Yeah.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:34.823
I'd give you the pieces,
but Mr. Little set them on fire.

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:39.744
I tried to warn you, Stuart.
I told you it wasn't gonna work out.

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:41.997
I should've known.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.124
It was too good to be true.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.251
What are you gonna do now?

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.420
I don't know. l guess I'll just--

01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:50.547
Leave immediately? Good idea.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:52.465
I'll tell the family you dropped by...

01:06:52.633 --> 01:06:55.427
...although it'll probably just
make them sick.

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:14.446
Bye, Snowbell.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.990
Goodbye, buddy.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:20.577
This is killing me.

01:07:22.496 --> 01:07:23.747
George.

01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:25.373
But I'm almost done.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.792
Come on. lt's getting late.
Time to go home.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.254
-I don't think I missed a single tree.
-You did a great job.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:34.799
-It was a good idea, wasn't it?
-You bet it was.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:37.218
It's a really good picture of Stuart.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.680
I don't think you could take
a bad picture of Stuart.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.474
Now all we have to do...

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:47.312
...is wait until somebody calls
and tells us where Stuart is.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.938
Right.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:44.202
If we don't find Stuart,
it's gonna break his heart.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:52.167
Snow! One of the guys spotted Stuart
in the park. Smokey sent me to get you.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:55.546
Gee, Monty, I'm in for the night.
It's late.

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:58.758
Besides, Stuart is gone.
Can't we just give the kid a break?

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:00.426
Of course we could.

01:09:00.594 --> 01:09:03.220
First we'll break his little arms,
then his little legs.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:04.680
And then we'll take a break.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:07.433
First we gotta find him.
Come on, we gotta run.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.562
Why do we have to run?
What is it, festival seating?

01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:16.192
Come on! l think we're getting closer.
I can smell him.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.902
Sorry, Smokey, that was me.

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:21.197
Didn't your mothers warn you not
to go into Central Park at night?

01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:24.408
My mother was the reason you didn't
go into Central Park at night.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.077
Yeah, you tell him, Smokey.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.956
Yeah, she was one tough broad.
She was a saint.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.419
Quick question. Who knows CPR?

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.130
There are mouse prints
going everywhere.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.174
-How will we find him?
-We'll split up...

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:42.135
-...and go in different directions.
-What a brain.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.429
That is why he is
gatto di tutti i gatti.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.599
You guys go ahead.

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:50.100
I'll just collapse right here.

01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:06.951
Stuart, is that you?
What are you doing up there?

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.245
I'm settling in.

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:11.497
Look, Stuart,
you gotta get out of here.

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:15.126
This is Central Park. It's dark out.
There are hungry cats all over.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.462
-Stuart, where are you?
-It's your pal, Monty.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.130
-What's he doing here?
-Come out!

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.633
-He'll hear you.
-Why shouldn't he hear me?

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:26.304
Snowbell! Buddy!
What are you doing up there?

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.181
Oh, no. Perfect.

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:32.185
Hey, you found him. Attaboy!

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:36.147
Hey, everybody!
Over here! Hey, guys!

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.191
Snow found him!

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:39.984
Nice going, house cat.

01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:43.655
Just for that, when we carve up
the mouse, you get the big half.

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:47.033
Big half? Snowbell,
what's he talking about?

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.369
Do you know those cats?

01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:51.663
Not really.
We went to a few parties, but--

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.164
What's the matter?

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:57.043
-What are you waiting for?
-Bring him down! I'm starving!

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.298
-Snowbell.
-Sorry, kid.

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:04.509
Snowbell-- Wait, no. Stop. Wait!

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.010
-No! Put me down!
-Buddy!

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.639
Hit me! l'm open!
I'll break his fall with my mouth!

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:11.516
I guess you do know them.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:14.018
Hey, let him go!
I can almost taste him!

01:11:14.186 --> 01:11:16.187
What are you waiting for?

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.647
Hey, where are you going?

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.691
He's hogging the mouse.
He ain't sharing.

01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:21.859
-Get him!
-He's getting away!

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:23.695
-Let's get him!
-Go! Go!

01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:27.323
Snowbell. Watch it.
Where are you going?

01:11:27.491 --> 01:11:29.200
Hold that branch for me.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.412
-My face.
-Get him!

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:39.085
Snowbell. You saved me?

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:40.837
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:44.632
Look, let's get one thing straight.
I'm doing this for the Littles, all right?

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.801
They love you. George loves you.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.554
They're all miserable without you.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.889
But, Snowbell, you said--

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:54.225
I know what I said. I--

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:57.729
I lied, okay?
Welcome to Manhattan.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:12:00.023
I'm the one that hates you.

01:12:00.899 --> 01:12:04.402
Snowbell. You do care.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.535
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
That's enough.

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:14.412
Snow, what's he doing to your leg?

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.624
I can't help but think this is wrong.

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:20.251
What the hell's going on here?

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:25.089
Look, Smokey, call me fickle...

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:27.842
...but I want to call
this whole thing off, okay?

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:30.094
Too late.

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:32.972
Come on, Smokey.
Can't we talk it over?

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.975
You know, Stuart's not so bad
once you get to know him.

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:37.852
And he's got his own car.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.396
Careful, house cat.
You're asking for it.

01:12:40.564 --> 01:12:43.858
Snow, what are you doing? Come on!
He's just a mouse.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:46.778
He's not just a mouse. He's--

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.281
He's--

01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:52.492
He's family.

01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:56.454
Oh, yeah.
I can see the resemblance.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:01.376
Is that what you think?
You have to look alike to be family?

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.630
You don't have to look alike.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:08.424
You don't even have to like each other.
Look at Snowbell.

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:12.553
He hates me.
And still, he's trying to save me.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.931
Sure, you'll probably
scratch him up pretty bad.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:17.183
You'll tear him to shreds.
May even kill him.

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:19.143
But Snowbell will not run away.

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:26.150
And that is what family is all about.
Right? Snow?

01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:29.487
Maybe "family" is too strong a word.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.531
-Scratch them both.
-Both?

01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:36.577
Hey, it's me you want!
Come and get me!

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.163
-Here we go!
-Let me at him!

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.418
Get him!

01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:47.839
-Let's go!
-Watch it! Out of my way!

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.592
Get him! Get him! He's getting away!

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:06.232
-Did he fall in the water?
-I don't know. I saw something hit.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.527
Man, did you see that?
Gone. He just disappeared.

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.195
Hey, there he is!

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:13.865
Up there!

01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:15.825
He's too far. l can't reach him.

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:21.122
In that case, you can all go home.
Prowl safely.

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.584
Here you go, boys. Dinner's served.

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:26.377
All right, Smokey. Way to go!

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:27.879
Oh, dear.

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:30.631
Look, it's mouse on a stick.
I love mouse on a stick.

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:35.720
A little further.
Keep him coming. Keep him coming.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:38.806
All right, I can almost reach him.
Keep it coming.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.433
I got him. He's mine.

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:45.480
-Hey!
-What the--?

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.398
The branch is gonna....

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:49.775
Well, what have we got here?

01:14:49.943 --> 01:14:52.236
Snow, don't come out here!
The branch is breaking!

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:56.908
-Stuart, are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah, l'm okay.

01:14:57.075 --> 01:14:58.951
Hang on. I'll take it from here.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:00.745
Take what?

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:07.001
Hey, come on, Snow.
You wouldn't do this to me.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.921
Not your old buddy.

01:15:10.088 --> 01:15:14.842
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm sure you'll land...

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.136
-...on your--
-Snow, what are you doing?

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.305
Wait! I gotta ask you something!

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.098
--feet!

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:27.313
Cold! Cold! Cold water!

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:28.981
I can't swim.

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:32.068
-Dog paddle.
-Dog paddle? l'd rather drown.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.278
And l had my fur
just the way l like it.

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:37.406
I'll be licking myself for days.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:43.120
How could he do this to me,
after all we've meant to each other?

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.042
I mean, I love that guy!

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.795
Hey, you guys! Wait up for me!

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.924
Pack up the pineapple, Stuart.
This luau's over.

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.635
Thanks, Snowbell. You were great.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.388
Well, it must've been quite a show
from up there.

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:05.309
-Snowbell.
-Those cats think they're so tough.

01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:07.687
-Snowbell?
-I guess I showed them.

01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:10.231
Not bad for a house cat.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.400
Not bad for a dead house cat.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.865
Say good night, Tinker Bell.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.577
Hey, Smokey!

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.331
His name is Snowbell.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:41.345
Oh, this water's damn cold.
I can't believe this!

01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:47.393
Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat.
What could be worse?

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.604
Nice doggy! No! No!

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.649
Little high, Little low.

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:56.193
Little hey, Little ho.

01:16:58.196 --> 01:17:00.031
Let's go home.

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:05.578
You know, Snow,
I don't know how to thank you.

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:08.706
How about not kicking me in the sides?
I'm beginning to bruise.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:12.960
Sorry. I was getting excited.
I've never ridden a cat bareback before.

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.712
Well, don't get used to it.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.839
Hold on, cowboy.

01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:28.559
-Thanks for the ride.
-Don't mention it. Ever.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:52.416
Mom! Dad! George!

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:56.420
It's me, Stuart! l'm back!

01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:03.594
Stuart!

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:08.265
Mom! Dad! George!

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:11.811
I missed you all so much.
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:14.021
I don't understand.
How did you manage it?

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:18.901
Every Little in the world can find
the Little house. And Snowbell.

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:21.070
