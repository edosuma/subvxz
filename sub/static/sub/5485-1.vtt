Ventris comes again. Collectors.

13:49.943 --> 13:51.744

CALO: - More brutal than ever.

13:51.845 --> 13:53.746
Doubled the tax,
doubled the guards.

13:53.847 --> 13:55.748
TORAN: They'll be at
our door by daybreak.

13:55.849 --> 13:58.251
Our journey is longer
traveling off the main trails.

13:58.352 --> 14:00.787
We need to ride now if we want
to catch them in darkness.

14:04.692 --> 14:06.560
His troops will be ready for us.

14:06.661 --> 14:08.494
The risk grows too great.

14:08.595 --> 14:11.930
They'll take what little stock
and harvest we have left.

14:12.031 --> 14:14.466
A winter of starvation
is the greater risk.

14:19.906 --> 14:21.807

14:30.316 --> 14:31.982

- No, Ash.

14:33.852 --> 14:35.286

BERBER:
If we need to make haste

14:40.992 --> 14:42.660
off beaten paths,
no one knows the woods

14:42.761 --> 14:44.495
- better than our clever trapper.
ASH: - Yeah. True.

14:44.597 --> 14:48.164
I know every twig from
here to the sea caverns.

14:48.266 --> 14:50.667
- Please.
- You can ride with us,

14:50.768 --> 14:52.669
but you don't fight.
And the sheep stays here.

14:52.770 --> 14:54.871
I get a hood though, right?

14:54.972 --> 14:57.140
Yea. I'll make you one
out of sheepskin.

14:57.242 --> 14:58.975
- (men laugh)
PETRA: - You can leave Miriam

14:59.076 --> 15:00.944

she'll be safe there.

15:01.045 --> 15:01.376

You're a cruel one,
Toran Prichard.

15:08.685 --> 15:10.019

(clicks tongue)

15:10.121 --> 15:12.055
Come on there, boys.

15:26.370 --> 15:27.570
I know that look.

15:27.671 --> 15:29.272
You should.

15:29.373 --> 15:31.274
I wear it often.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.610
Ventris is sly and brutal.

15:34.711 --> 15:37.280
It's only time and chance
before you feel his blade.

15:37.381 --> 15:40.516
You're not a
rebel, Wilkin.

15:40.617 --> 15:42.518
Let the band of Byth Encil

15:42.619 --> 15:44.519
take their defiant
vengeance to our baron.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.289
This isn't about vengeance.

15:47.390 --> 15:48.723
You heard your father.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.393
We take this risk

15:51.494 --> 15:53.094
to survive.

15:53.195 --> 15:55.930
The baron's tax leech
comes twice a season now.

15:56.031 --> 15:57.632
We've barely stock
and food to live.

15:57.733 --> 16:01.803
You're the only stock
I can't live without!

16:04.806 --> 16:06.640
(sighs)

16:08.643 --> 16:10.644
ANNORA:
Good morning, farmer.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.118
Fair dame.

16:18.219 --> 16:20.654
And how is our gentle
lytling doing today?

16:20.755 --> 16:22.623
Very active.

16:22.724 --> 16:23.889
Hmm.

16:23.990 --> 16:26.125
A life eager

16:26.226 --> 16:28.894
to begin a greater journey.

16:31.332 --> 16:32.298
Yea.

16:32.399 --> 16:35.034
You must cover
this wound.

16:35.135 --> 16:38.805
The spill layer of the river
swims with sickness.

16:38.905 --> 16:40.873
I'm fine.

16:40.974 --> 16:43.007
And in
three days' time,

16:43.108 --> 16:44.909
you will be weak
and fevered.

16:46.912 --> 16:48.847
Boil these.

16:48.948 --> 16:51.383
Soak the wound
in the broth.

16:51.484 --> 16:52.884
Yea.

16:55.521 --> 16:57.556
Thank you.

17:13.938 --> 17:15.939
The other man.

17:22.012 --> 17:25.181
God has put him
on our path.

17:30.654 --> 17:32.154

17:34.157 --> 17:37.326
Quarter rips for
the other two quaints.

17:37.428 --> 17:38.795
(sighs) _

17:38.896 --> 17:40.263
It's double shillings
for that.

17:40.364 --> 17:43.099
Finish the task.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.967
Fair rate will follow.

17:46.003 --> 17:48.570
(screaming)

17:57.981 --> 17:59.548
(sighs)

17:59.649 --> 18:01.317
Did you soak the rag
in dumb paste?

18:01.418 --> 18:03.718
I... I...

18:03.819 --> 18:05.753
The pot wouldn't fit
in the bags, Father.

18:05.854 --> 18:07.588
But I can...

18:14.797 --> 18:17.565
(panting)

18:17.666 --> 18:19.600
Stupid and weak.

18:24.073 --> 18:26.074
Stupid and weak.

18:53.547 --> 18:56.416
God, I hate when she does that.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.690
Milady?

19:03.791 --> 19:05.258
Lady Love?

19:07.294 --> 19:08.495
Shit.

19:12.933 --> 19:15.635

19:17.605 --> 19:18.804

19:22.609 --> 19:25.177

19:25.278 --> 19:28.080
Can you please
not do that, Love?

19:28.181 --> 19:30.850
My heart drowns
with you every time.

19:30.951 --> 19:34.019
I'm fine,
dear Isabel.

19:34.120 --> 19:37.189
I've been swimming in this
water since I was born.

19:37.290 --> 19:39.091
The chill refreshes
my spirit.

19:39.192 --> 19:40.892
Reminds me of
who I am.

19:40.994 --> 19:43.728
The baroness
who caught her death?

19:43.830 --> 19:48.067
The hopeful Welsh girl who
knows God holds her close.

19:48.168 --> 19:49.901
He has a journey in mind.

19:50.003 --> 19:51.236
Yes.

19:51.338 --> 19:53.505
I know that girl.

19:59.712 --> 20:01.913
Time is a most
aggressive foe, Milus.

20:02.014 --> 20:04.950
Favor of my rule
changes with the wind.

20:05.050 --> 20:07.619
The unrest that grows
on this damp rock...

20:07.720 --> 20:10.489
I need to make my gains
now, while I still hold

20:10.590 --> 20:12.990
the king's trust.

20:13.091 --> 20:15.058
Wealth, my lord,

20:15.159 --> 20:17.795
is the foundation
of any temple of power.

20:17.896 --> 20:20.163
We need to fortify
our resources.

20:20.264 --> 20:22.967
Steeper taxes and tariffs.

20:23.067 --> 20:24.368
Yes, agreed.

20:24.469 --> 20:27.237
Pardon, Lord Ventris,
good Chamberlain.

20:27.338 --> 20:29.740
Baron Pryce's emissary
waits for you at the market.

20:29.841 --> 20:31.642
He is... quite eager.

20:31.743 --> 20:34.844
I assume Pryce
sends no gifts

20:34.945 --> 20:36.480
with his eager
messenger?

20:36.580 --> 20:38.715
Gifts, Baron?

20:38.816 --> 20:40.984
Stuffed pheasant.
Aged wine.

20:41.085 --> 20:42.219
A bevy of
virgin whores.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.586
Why would he send such?

20:43.687 --> 20:45.522
Ballok cod.

20:45.623 --> 20:46.956
Why does he want an audience?

20:47.058 --> 20:48.058
Oh, yes.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.692
Again, he makes a heated point

20:49.793 --> 20:50.927
of the steep tariff.

20:51.029 --> 20:52.362
Asserts that Baron Pryce

20:52.463 --> 20:54.697
will refuse payment
if it grows again.

20:54.798 --> 20:56.799
If Pryce wants access to
the sea, he will pay for it.

20:56.901 --> 21:00.102
And if he refuses, then we
have cause to assert power.

21:00.203 --> 21:01.905
Into Pryceshire?

21:02.006 --> 21:04.807
But his legions outnumber ours.

21:04.909 --> 21:07.744
Pryce is a man
of books.

21:07.845 --> 21:10.312
Thinkers die
in battle.

21:10.414 --> 21:12.881
Good Baron.

21:12.982 --> 21:14.683
Chamberlain.

21:17.153 --> 21:19.555
What is our passage
for today, Father?

21:19.656 --> 21:22.457
Genesis.

21:22.559 --> 21:26.127
We're learning how
God created us in his likeness.

21:26.228 --> 21:28.329
Gave us a perfect world.

21:30.733 --> 21:33.501
Care to join us, Baron?

21:35.070 --> 21:37.705
Yes.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.808
Another time, Father.

21:50.418 --> 21:51.886
And what of our king?

21:51.987 --> 21:54.388
Where will Edward sit
in this dispute with you

21:54.489 --> 21:55.755
and Baron Pryce?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.924
Where his soft French
bottom always sits--

21:58.025 --> 21:59.526
in the middle,

21:59.627 --> 22:02.662
waiting like a flowered
girl to coo the victor.

22:02.763 --> 22:05.399
With a mouth
full of noble seed.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.736
Ah, yes.
Because he's a bit fancy.

22:09.837 --> 22:11.405

VENTRIS:
Tell Pryce's man

22:33.759 --> 22:35.660
the tariff
just went up again.

22:35.761 --> 22:37.061
A third?

22:37.163 --> 22:39.464
More than fair.

22:39.565 --> 22:42.267
But, my lord, you...
you realize you taunt him

22:42.368 --> 22:43.502
by raising it
yet again?

22:43.603 --> 22:45.237
The taunt <i>is</i> the message.

22:45.338 --> 22:47.972
Deliver it.

22:48.073 --> 22:50.108
Yes. Sorry.

22:50.209 --> 22:52.210
Baron. Chamberlain.

22:54.713 --> 22:56.280
Hello, sir.

Yeah, because you don't have

not playing hero, old man.

Whittling is for the lame

the funeral mask.

23:53.869 --> 23:55.203
I'm not dead yet, wife.

The mask is for me.

23:56.706 --> 23:59.607

you reckless poke.

32:41.664 --> 32:43.399
Gwynedd and the minor turns.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.633
Here.

32:44.734 --> 32:47.069
Branches of the Dunoding
run west.

32:47.170 --> 32:48.904
Touch the far end
of the shire.

32:49.005 --> 32:50.906
We've settlers there?

32:51.007 --> 32:52.475
No, I think...

32:52.576 --> 32:53.509
JONAS:
Yes.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.311
Yes, we do.

32:55.412 --> 32:57.045
Barley farmers.

32:57.147 --> 32:58.981
West River Riding.

32:59.082 --> 33:00.983
Quarterly collections.

33:01.084 --> 33:02.817
Oh, West River.

33:02.918 --> 33:04.219
Yes, of course.

33:04.320 --> 33:05.653
Half legion and
horsemen, my charge.

33:05.754 --> 33:06.954
You ride with us.

33:07.055 --> 33:08.389
Pick out the watcher.

33:08.491 --> 33:09.457
Make sound guesses
of the others

33:09.558 --> 33:12.026
without their clever hoods.

33:12.128 --> 33:14.061
CORBETT:
You as well, Reeve.

33:14.163 --> 33:16.231
Get to know your shire.

33:16.332 --> 33:17.465
RANDULF:
Yes, dear brother.

33:17.566 --> 33:19.501
Baron. My lady.

33:25.008 --> 33:27.441
And what of manor law?

33:27.542 --> 33:30.477
Is there a mind for fairness
in your swift purpose?

33:31.813 --> 33:33.547
Of course, my love.

33:33.648 --> 33:35.582
Fair process for every man.

33:43.158 --> 33:45.392
I know your distress
is undoubtedly

33:45.493 --> 33:49.396
about the safety
of your husband, my lady,

33:49.497 --> 33:51.597
but an ignorant eye
may see it

33:51.699 --> 33:54.467
as concern
for the welfare of outlaws.

33:54.568 --> 33:56.903
Well, I thank my maker
that I'm in the presence

33:57.004 --> 33:59.939
of a man who never leans
towards ignorance.

34:02.009 --> 34:04.010
Indeed.

34:04.111 --> 34:05.812
Knowledge is my service.

34:05.913 --> 34:08.281
Indeed.

34:08.382 --> 34:12.251
Perhaps you should share some of
that knowledge with my husband.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.687
Let him know that his thirst
to grow this shire

34:14.788 --> 34:16.522
should not be quenched

34:16.623 --> 34:19.625
with the sweat and blood
of its own people.

34:19.726 --> 34:23.596
It is the people's duty
to tithe.

34:23.697 --> 34:25.264
Only rebels

34:25.364 --> 34:27.266
refuse to honor
the rule of law.

34:27.367 --> 34:29.001
No commoner wants rebellion.

34:29.101 --> 34:32.471
It only comes after hope and
reason are burned to the ground.

34:32.572 --> 34:35.074
Tell me, Baroness.

34:35.175 --> 34:38.076
How is it that someone
of your privilege

34:38.177 --> 34:41.446
may come to know
the plight of the common man?

34:43.516 --> 34:46.717
Well, unlike some
within these walls,

34:46.819 --> 34:49.853
I live with open eyes
and open heart.

34:52.592 --> 34:55.193
You will break them, Milus.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.094
And we both know
there's nothing more dangerous

34:57.196 --> 35:00.532
than a Welshman
who has nothing to lose.

35:09.041 --> 35:12.743
Keep my husband to a safe path.

35:12.844 --> 35:16.580
I'm depending on you,
good Chamberlain.

Midshire hares!

36:05.995 --> 36:08.397
Big enough to mount.
(laughs)

36:08.498 --> 36:09.864
We want to skewer them
with sticks,

36:09.965 --> 36:11.366
not with our pricks,
you beast-lover.

36:11.467 --> 36:13.335
(laughter)

36:13.436 --> 36:15.337
JACOB:
Don't listen to him, boy.

36:15.438 --> 36:18.407
We take our comfort
wherever we find it.

36:18.508 --> 36:20.442
And what if you find him
taking comfort in your pen...

36:21.644 --> 36:23.044
...poking your prize hog?

36:23.145 --> 36:24.546
(laughter)

36:24.647 --> 36:26.380
I don't fancy hogs.

He's a one-sheep man.

36:29.885 --> 36:31.886

36:40.763 --> 36:42.797
Why does Wilk
use oak and not a blade?

36:46.035 --> 36:48.202
There are many things

36:48.303 --> 36:51.038
we do not know about our leader.

36:51.140 --> 36:52.140
Even Petra knows
little of his life

36:52.241 --> 36:53.241
before he came to the river.

36:53.342 --> 36:55.409
ASH:
Had to be a soldier.

36:55.511 --> 36:57.978
The fight skill
he's given you--

36:58.079 --> 37:00.581
that was learned on a field
of battle, not barley.

37:00.682 --> 37:03.651
We've all tales

37:54.502 --> 37:57.236
by the work of our hands,
Wilkin.

37:57.337 --> 38:01.641
In service of gods or king,
it doesn't matter.

We're driven by
a deeper burn,

40:03.227 --> 40:05.794
have skill enough
to knell our noble ranks?

He should.

51:07.886 --> 51:10.922
My sorrow.

51:16.028 --> 51:18.238
Forgive me.

51:20.865 --> 51:22.866
(sizzling, quiet gasping)

51:27.271 --> 51:29.272
(panting, sobbing)

51:41.250 --> 51:43.685
The witch.

51:51.027 --> 51:52.994
What brings you so far east,

51:53.095 --> 51:54.829
woman?

51:54.931 --> 51:57.799
The same thing
that brings all of you.

51:57.900 --> 52:00.068
We flee the darkness.

52:00.169 --> 52:02.637
Did you witness the massacre?

52:02.738 --> 52:04.639
No.

52:04.740 --> 52:09.009
But I will witness yours
unless you alter your purpose.

52:09.110 --> 52:11.979
There's nothing to alter.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.713
We face what's ahead.

52:13.815 --> 52:18.652
But you do not need
to face it alone.

52:18.753 --> 52:23.257
Your cynic-- he has ties
to the way of victory.

52:33.367 --> 52:36.903
You are all knots and coil.

52:37.004 --> 52:38.404
(inhales)

52:38.506 --> 52:41.240
Pain of yesterday's
fierce effort.

52:41.342 --> 52:42.676
(sighs softly)

52:44.679 --> 52:47.080
So you found your bandits.

52:47.181 --> 52:49.048
No.

52:49.149 --> 52:51.985
But we met with the
proof of their guilt.

52:53.988 --> 52:55.955
And you've returned
with that proof?

52:56.056 --> 52:58.557
(chuckles)

52:58.658 --> 53:01.461
Difficult to carry
bone and slag.

53:01.561 --> 53:02.695
(door opens)

53:02.796 --> 53:04.797
CORBETT:
My lord.

53:04.898 --> 53:07.033
A scout came through from
midshire this morning.

53:07.134 --> 53:09.767
Spotted seven men
traveling east last night.

53:09.869 --> 53:12.604
One with a sword
bearing Longshanks' mark.

53:12.705 --> 53:14.606
Our bandits on a
mission, perhaps.

53:14.707 --> 53:17.042
Taking their vengeance
to my gate?

53:17.143 --> 53:19.478
Are they that mad with grief?

53:19.578 --> 53:22.981
Or soldiers willing to die
in service of their sorrow.

53:23.082 --> 53:25.150
I think it best
we meet them in journey,

53:25.251 --> 53:28.487
away from anyone who may see
this fool play as valiant.

53:28.587 --> 53:29.921
Stay.

53:30.023 --> 53:32.090
Protect the walls.

53:32.191 --> 53:33.824
Prepare a full legion
of foot soldiers.

53:33.925 --> 53:36.093
I'll gut this warrior bandit.

53:36.194 --> 53:38.795
Choke him cold with a snare
of his own entrails.

53:38.897 --> 53:40.831
A fine plan, my lord.

53:44.536 --> 53:46.937
Are you waiting
for a royal proclamation?

53:47.039 --> 53:48.605
Go with him, Reeve.

53:48.706 --> 53:50.874
Yes, indeed.
Chamberlain.

53:50.975 --> 53:52.309
My lady.

54:01.519 --> 54:03.520
(horses neighing)

54:16.701 --> 54:19.036
Who are you, traveler?

54:19.136 --> 54:21.037
Gawain Maddox, milord.

54:21.137 --> 54:22.772
I come up from the South.

54:22.873 --> 54:24.607
Punisher by trade.

54:24.708 --> 54:26.642
You have tools in possession?

54:26.743 --> 54:28.210
Yea'on.

54:28.311 --> 54:29.645
Ride with us.

54:29.746 --> 54:32.281
I may need
your services.

54:32.382 --> 54:34.550
My family.

54:34.651 --> 54:36.052
Ride the main trail north.

54:36.152 --> 54:37.987
It leads to Castle Ventris.

54:38.088 --> 54:40.022
They can wait there.

54:42.024 --> 54:43.992
Just follow on.

54:44.093 --> 54:46.027
I'll be with you.

54:52.501 --> 54:54.502
(horses sputtering)

55:07.549 --> 55:11.385
Do you remember me,
Earl Constable?

55:13.422 --> 55:15.423
I'm the knight
you sent to his death

55:15.524 --> 55:18.726
at the hands
of the hoarding Scots.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.661
Impossible.

55:21.762 --> 55:25.231
You know this man, my lord?

55:25.333 --> 55:28.601
If you are indeed
that knight,

55:28.703 --> 55:32.271
you're either a
deserter or a ghost.

55:32.373 --> 55:35.642
If not dead then,

55:35.743 --> 55:37.677
then dead now.

55:43.416 --> 55:47.353
I live with the terror
of your betrayal every day.

55:50.157 --> 55:54.093
But I'll spare you that pain.

55:54.194 --> 55:57.029
Death will quiet your mind.

56:06.138 --> 56:08.206
They're all rebels, milord.

56:10.577 --> 56:13.912
Time to go back to hell,
Marcher Baron!

56:14.814 --> 56:16.114
(whistles)

56:16.215 --> 56:17.382
(horses neighing)

56:20.553 --> 56:23.488
<i>Deus vult!</i>

56:23.589 --> 56:25.022
(men shouting)

56:48.479 --> 56:50.447
(yells)

57:19.842 --> 57:21.008
Go, go, go!

57:24.713 --> 57:26.213
(screams)

57:29.952 --> 57:31.820
(neighs)

57:50.738 --> 57:52.072
(grunts)

58:08.288 --> 58:09.555
(screams)

58:40.619 --> 58:44.555
Not ghost, nor deserter.

58:44.656 --> 58:47.424
Nor hood.

58:53.296 --> 58:54.964
(yells)

59:03.507 --> 59:05.074
(yells)

59:12.148 --> 59:13.181
(yells)

59:26.396 --> 59:28.095
VENTRIS:
London will hunt down

59:28.196 --> 59:31.633
the hooded bandits
and crush your toy rebellion.

59:31.734 --> 59:33.768
I've no rebellion.

59:33.869 --> 59:35.637
Just a need to see you die.

59:39.275 --> 59:40.308
(yells)

59:57.926 --> 59:59.927
♪

01:00:28.675 --> 01:00:31.277
How is he?
Will he heal?

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:35.114
Only blood runs,
no other humors.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.149
He will sleep.

01:00:45.157 --> 01:00:47.292
BERBER:
Ventris was right.

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:48.826
The king's army

01:00:48.928 --> 01:00:52.797
will come, hunt down
the hooded thieves.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:56.167
Yea. No rock unturned until our shit
holes are split on the cradle.

01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:57.202
Mm.

01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:01.471
Your, uh...

01:01:01.573 --> 01:01:04.508
your dark friend--
is he, um...

01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:06.210
in our pope's grace?

01:01:06.311 --> 01:01:09.179
A moor, converted
in his homeland.

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:13.483
A good Catholic like us all.

01:01:14.719 --> 01:01:17.721
Yea. Bloody work
is the Lord's.

01:01:17.822 --> 01:01:19.055
TORAN:
Indeed.

01:01:21.959 --> 01:01:24.093
I need a name
to offer my thanks.

01:01:24.194 --> 01:01:25.761
Gruffudd.

01:01:25.862 --> 01:01:28.631
You're the one
they call "the wolf."

01:01:28.732 --> 01:01:30.599
I'm called many
hard things.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.035
Most by my wife.

01:01:32.136 --> 01:01:34.670
Thank you for answering
our plea, Gruffudd.

01:01:34.771 --> 01:01:36.339
We serve each
other, friend.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.807
The baron's forged weapons
will be a welcome change

01:01:38.909 --> 01:01:40.876
from our sticks
and cobbled blades.

01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:42.745
Ventris has lost
nearly two legions.

01:01:42.846 --> 01:01:44.080
His army is weakened.

01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.814
We're not ready to storm walls.

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:47.417
Even with noble swords.

01:01:47.518 --> 01:01:51.353
But word of this victory
will spread and it will inspire.

01:01:51.454 --> 01:01:52.687
Our numbers
will grow.

01:01:52.788 --> 01:01:54.423
I have no doubt.

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:57.692
Godspeed for your knight's
return to sound body.

01:01:57.793 --> 01:01:59.994
An unlikely ally
in our fight.

01:02:00.096 --> 01:02:01.996
Let him know there
may come a time

01:02:02.098 --> 01:02:03.798
when I collect
on this favor.

01:02:13.008 --> 01:02:15.109
Toran, Moor!

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:22.650
You crazy witch!

01:02:29.357 --> 01:02:30.758
To what end

01:02:30.859 --> 01:02:32.794
does this devilry serve?

01:02:36.197 --> 01:02:38.198
(grunting)

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:49.009
The baron has returned?

01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:52.012
No. But I have
news of his need.

01:02:52.113 --> 01:02:54.214
At Heaven's Eye,
we saw the rebel symbols.

01:02:54.315 --> 01:02:57.584
Lord Ventris sent me back
to secure more troops.

01:02:59.419 --> 01:03:01.887
Sent you back? Alone?

01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:03.656
Not to spare arms he may need.

01:03:03.757 --> 01:03:05.691
I welcomed the risk
of riding apart.

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.006
Gather what men we can spare.

01:03:20.107 --> 01:03:21.774
With haste.

01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:27.279
Shall I find
the baroness?

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.282
No. You should find a bath.

01:03:30.383 --> 01:03:32.951
You reek of shit.

01:03:33.052 --> 01:03:34.453
And fear.

01:03:51.336 --> 01:03:53.337
(sighs)

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.397
(groans)

01:04:26.004 --> 01:04:28.805
You join the living.

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:30.506
Who did this?

01:04:30.607 --> 01:04:32.709
The healer.

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:34.744
She offered no reason.

01:04:42.219 --> 01:04:43.619
(groans)

01:05:04.974 --> 01:05:06.975
Cut her binds.

01:05:20.456 --> 01:05:22.923
Why did you cut and scar me?

01:05:23.024 --> 01:05:25.727
To save you.

01:05:25.827 --> 01:05:28.162
Your only chance

01:05:28.263 --> 01:05:30.965
to live is to be supposed dead.

01:05:33.301 --> 01:05:35.335
He gives you that gift.

01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:56.222
Who are you, woman?

01:05:56.324 --> 01:05:58.057
Truly.

01:05:58.159 --> 01:06:01.094
What's your
interest in me?

01:06:03.598 --> 01:06:07.100
You have a fate...

01:06:07.201 --> 01:06:09.135
that you must learn to hold.

01:06:09.236 --> 01:06:14.107
One that will forever
mark your place in time.

01:06:16.143 --> 01:06:18.812
I am here to help
tell that story.

01:06:20.848 --> 01:06:22.883
My story is over.

01:06:22.984 --> 01:06:24.784
No.

01:06:24.886 --> 01:06:28.221
It is just begun.

01:06:28.322 --> 01:06:31.356
The angel spoke the truth.

01:06:35.395 --> 01:06:37.596
The angel?

01:06:37.697 --> 01:06:40.833
The bright child
who came to you.

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:44.336
How...

01:06:46.339 --> 01:06:50.375
I've never whispered
a word of that to anyone.

01:06:52.412 --> 01:06:55.180
I hear the same voices.

01:06:58.684 --> 01:07:02.554
It's time to lay down
this sword, Wilkin Brattle.

01:07:04.157 --> 01:07:06.291
(angel child's voice):
Your savior needs you

01:07:06.392 --> 01:07:09.561
to live the life
of a different man.

01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:39.633
Unhitch one of the
horses, brother.

01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:42.102
Then go join the
others at the caves.

01:07:42.203 --> 01:07:45.839
I think I'll finish
the ride, friend.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.542
A plan hatched by a witch--
what's to worry?

01:07:50.545 --> 01:07:55.148
We deliver the dead, tell
the tale, and ride off.

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.817
Free men, no price
on our head.

01:07:57.918 --> 01:07:59.685
It's a sound devise.

01:07:59.787 --> 01:08:02.221
Simple enough an executioner
could carry it forth.

01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:04.223
(chuckles)

01:08:04.323 --> 01:08:06.391
And what say
of your purpose.

01:08:06.492 --> 01:08:10.062
What name for you?
Sneermonger?

01:08:12.132 --> 01:08:16.068
Well, my da, he wanted
to call me Marshal.

01:08:16.169 --> 01:08:18.770
But my ma thought it
too destined to war.

01:08:18.872 --> 01:08:21.673
Ma got the name,
da got the destiny.

01:08:21.774 --> 01:08:23.707
Yea, indeed.

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:25.710
And what of your father?

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.746
You never tell of anything.

01:08:30.448 --> 01:08:33.752
There's nothing to tell.
I don't have one.

01:08:36.555 --> 01:08:37.955
(grunts)

01:08:40.393 --> 01:08:43.127
(children's choir
singing Latin hymn)

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.941
(choir continues
singing Latin hymn)

01:09:17.227 --> 01:09:18.894
(choir continues)

01:09:18.995 --> 01:09:20.395
ISABEL:
Pardon, Baroness.

01:09:20.497 --> 01:09:21.863
(choir stops singing)

01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:23.499
Outsiders have come.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.934
They bring sad news.

01:09:40.115 --> 01:09:42.116
Bring him down.

01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:22.089
My deepest condolences,
Lady Love.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.458
Let's bring you and the baron
into the castle

01:10:24.559 --> 01:10:26.493
so you can mourn in peace.

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:40.407
Have the baron taken
to the sacrament room.

01:10:50.817 --> 01:10:53.151
Who are you?

01:10:56.155 --> 01:10:58.156
Gawain Maddox, milady.

01:10:58.257 --> 01:11:02.193
Punisher by trade,
from the southern land.

01:11:02.295 --> 01:11:04.195
This is Marshal,

01:11:04.297 --> 01:11:08.999
a journey soldier-- he aids me
in the capture of the accused.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.436
Tell me of his death.

01:11:11.537 --> 01:11:14.605
We met the baron
at Heaven's Eye.

01:11:14.706 --> 01:11:16.607
Called upon us
to ride with him.

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.208
At the grass fields,

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:20.445
they crossed a band
of hooded thieves.

01:11:20.546 --> 01:11:21.879
Took a fierce run.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.515
Noblemen cut down
the seven of them.

01:11:24.616 --> 01:11:26.683
WILKIN:
Before the baron could rally,

01:11:26.784 --> 01:11:28.585
rebels attacked.

01:11:28.686 --> 01:11:30.921
50 or more.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:34.558
Caught the ranks tired
and out of formation.

01:11:34.659 --> 01:11:38.595
Your husband fought gallantly,
but the numbers were too steep.

01:11:39.997 --> 01:11:41.631
I'm sorry.

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:47.603
Old men and boys.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.972
WILKIN: Your mail-clad soldiers
were too heavy to carry.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:54.743
We can send troops there
to collect the others.

01:11:54.845 --> 01:11:57.746
LADY LOVE: And what brings
an executioner to Ventrishire?

01:11:57.848 --> 01:11:59.648
Work, milady.

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.684
I travel, go where
my services are needed.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:03.719
RANDULF:
He lies!

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.589
This man is
not the executioner.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.526
He's one of the thieves.

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.060
As is that one.

01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:15.997
You're the liar, sir.

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:19.233
I've traveled with Gawain
for many years.

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.803
Dispatch a messenger
to Glamorgan for proof.

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:24.705
There is no other face
looks like this one.

01:12:24.806 --> 01:12:26.907
WILKIN:
We just came

01:12:27.008 --> 01:12:28.876
to deliver the dead.

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:30.911
Out of respect.

01:12:31.012 --> 01:12:32.880
We'll leave if it upsets
your court.

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:36.383
You'll stay and be quartered.

01:12:36.484 --> 01:12:39.720
The remedy for this dispute
is already here.

01:12:41.222 --> 01:12:43.356
The wife and children
of Maddox, sent here

01:12:43.457 --> 01:12:45.591
to wait for his return.

01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:51.498
Come forward.

01:12:54.402 --> 01:12:56.802
Tell us the truth.

01:12:56.904 --> 01:12:59.239
Is this man indeed your husband?

01:13:18.958 --> 01:13:20.959
(fussing)

01:13:26.831 --> 01:13:28.632
(trembling breaths)

01:13:28.733 --> 01:13:30.668
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

01:13:37.376 --> 01:13:39.377
My love.

01:13:41.913 --> 01:13:45.082
Good Maddy, thank God
you've come back safe.

01:13:49.854 --> 01:13:51.655
This is lunacy!

01:13:51.756 --> 01:13:54.224
She conspires with him!

01:13:58.463 --> 01:14:01.330
Such tragedy...

01:14:01.431 --> 01:14:03.800
lands on my name this day.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.173
My dearest friend,

01:14:11.274 --> 01:14:14.611
a life snuffed...

01:14:14.712 --> 01:14:17.146
not in a fitting battle...

01:14:18.415 --> 01:14:21.617
but by the ambush
of painted dogs.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.489
And my kin.

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:30.391
Caught between two tales.

01:14:30.493 --> 01:14:32.293
I speak only truth,
dear brother.

01:14:32.394 --> 01:14:34.963
I have nothing to gain
from such a lie.

01:14:35.064 --> 01:14:37.165
These men are
the bandits we pursued.

01:14:37.266 --> 01:14:39.167
Did battle in the
fields beyond the eye.

01:14:39.268 --> 01:14:42.170
I myself
and other honored knights

01:14:42.271 --> 01:14:44.272
heard you tell
how you were dispatched

01:14:44.373 --> 01:14:46.841
<i>before</i> any such fray.

01:14:50.646 --> 01:14:52.113
Yea.

01:14:52.214 --> 01:14:54.482
- I did, but...
WILKIN: - You may have

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:58.101
nothing to gain, but
you've much to hide.

01:14:58.186 --> 01:15:01.756
We saw this man at the fray.

01:15:01.857 --> 01:15:04.759
He tucked tail and slithered
away, letting his brothers

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.047
fall to the curs.

01:15:07.596 --> 01:15:09.731
That's why he lies.

01:15:09.832 --> 01:15:11.233
'Cause we know
the truth.

01:15:11.334 --> 01:15:12.667
That's...

01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:14.702
- I tell you, these are the...
CORBETT: - Enough!

01:15:26.248 --> 01:15:28.916
So, then, Reeve...

01:15:29.017 --> 01:15:32.219
you are either a false accuser

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.621
or you deserted your commander
in battle!

01:15:36.623 --> 01:15:39.492
Both come with
a punishment of death!

01:15:41.628 --> 01:15:44.097
(whispering):
Please...

01:15:44.198 --> 01:15:45.999
Milus...

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.566
brother...

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:49.102
do not do this.

01:15:49.703 --> 01:15:51.169
Take him!

01:15:51.271 --> 01:15:52.838
Brother, we are blood.

01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:54.572
Do not betray me.
Damn you!

01:15:54.673 --> 01:15:56.073
Damn your half-hatred!

01:15:56.174 --> 01:15:57.241
Damn y...

01:15:57.342 --> 01:15:58.075
(grunts)

01:15:58.176 --> 01:16:00.111
(gasping)

01:16:00.212 --> 01:16:01.880
(Randulf yells)

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.616
I'm gonna speak
to the King!

01:16:04.717 --> 01:16:05.983
Curse you!

01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:07.519
I'll curse you
from hell!

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.387
(Randulf sobbing)

01:16:17.495 --> 01:16:20.898
My shame is only
outdone by my sadness.

01:16:22.934 --> 01:16:26.202
My deepest sympathies, Baroness.

01:16:26.304 --> 01:16:29.673
I am in your service,
whatever the need.

01:16:31.275 --> 01:16:33.409
Thank you, Milus.

01:16:35.479 --> 01:16:38.380
I will do haste
with manor law and trial.

01:16:40.484 --> 01:16:42.184
It is fitting...

01:16:42.285 --> 01:16:44.286
that the man falsely accused

01:16:44.387 --> 01:16:47.924
be the one who is skilled
to take his head.

01:16:59.335 --> 01:17:02.771
Welcome to Castle Ventris,
executioner.

01:17:34.068 --> 01:17:36.302
Baroness.

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:39.138
The priest, he said I could
come for evening prayer.

01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:40.740
Please, sit.

01:17:40.841 --> 01:17:42.809
I welcome the chapel's use.

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:45.712
Few spend time here but me.

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:51.451
Do you mind?

01:17:53.353 --> 01:17:54.987
Please.

01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:06.031
I wouldn't think

01:18:06.133 --> 01:18:09.569
one of your trade would
complicate things with prayer.

01:18:12.106 --> 01:18:15.408
Perhaps it takes you
in deeper.

01:18:20.347 --> 01:18:23.248
May I ask how
this happened?

01:18:25.418 --> 01:18:27.719
It was given to me
by a healer.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.888
A holy woman.

01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:33.291
A reminder
of my need for faith.

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:37.895
Your soldier gave
the impression

01:18:37.997 --> 01:18:39.831
it distinguished
you for some time.

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:43.401
Yet, the burn looks fresh.

01:18:43.503 --> 01:18:46.171
I renew the vow
when my faith wavers.

01:18:50.175 --> 01:18:52.576
You're bleeding.

01:18:52.678 --> 01:18:54.979
Yea.

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.415
An angry branch
on last night's ride.

01:18:58.517 --> 01:19:00.885
May I?

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:03.287
WILKIN:
In here, milady?

01:19:03.388 --> 01:19:04.922
LADY LOVE:
No better one

01:19:05.024 --> 01:19:07.324
to heal you than Him.

01:19:18.202 --> 01:19:20.570
The physicker
should look at this.

01:19:23.507 --> 01:19:27.911
(baby crying)

01:19:40.224 --> 01:19:42.625
I'll find the physicker.

01:19:42.726 --> 01:19:46.028
No. Stay.

01:19:46.129 --> 01:19:47.830
Finish your devotion.

01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:50.933
I'll have him find you.

01:20:17.293 --> 01:20:20.962
Baroness?

01:20:21.063 --> 01:20:24.165
I sent an emissary
to London

01:20:24.267 --> 01:20:29.137
and one to Erik's brother
in Coventry.

01:20:29.239 --> 01:20:34.174
I'm sure our king will offer
comfort and guidance

01:20:34.276 --> 01:20:36.777
of how we proceed
to govern.

01:20:36.878 --> 01:20:39.947
We proceed by
burying my husband.

01:20:41.182 --> 01:20:43.484
Yes.

01:20:43.585 --> 01:20:45.686
Of course.

01:20:47.856 --> 01:20:50.258
Another thought,

01:20:50.359 --> 01:20:52.292
my lady.

01:20:52.393 --> 01:20:55.662
This executioner--

01:20:55.764 --> 01:20:57.631
his arrival,

01:20:57.732 --> 01:21:01.168
although it brought sadness--

01:21:01.269 --> 01:21:03.470
it could turn
to good fortune.

01:21:03.571 --> 01:21:04.905
How so?

01:21:05.006 --> 01:21:07.474
If we secure him
and his soldier,

01:21:07.575 --> 01:21:10.477
we gain skilled men
to hunt offenders

01:21:10.578 --> 01:21:12.813
and carry out the correction.

01:21:12.914 --> 01:21:17.350
Sends a sound message.

01:21:17.451 --> 01:21:20.754
Ventrishire will not
suffer lawlessness.

01:21:23.624 --> 01:21:27.093
That's well advised,
dear Chamberlain.

01:21:27.194 --> 01:21:30.062
Good. I'll draft the letters

01:21:30.164 --> 01:21:32.465
that bind them.

01:21:51.618 --> 01:21:55.587
I have news, Maddox.

01:21:57.190 --> 01:22:01.293
The trial was swift,
the guilt clear.

01:22:02.862 --> 01:22:05.297
We will stage the execution
in the village square

01:22:05.398 --> 01:22:07.700
midday tomorrow.

01:22:13.873 --> 01:22:16.541
He's your blood.

01:22:16.642 --> 01:22:18.977
There must be some...

01:22:19.078 --> 01:22:22.347
due leniency, a brother's mercy?

01:22:22.448 --> 01:22:24.716
You rid me of a mistake

01:22:24.817 --> 01:22:29.221
influenced by familial guilt.

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:34.659
No kin, no worries.

01:22:36.528 --> 01:22:39.263
But of course,
you wouldn't understand that.

01:22:39.364 --> 01:22:42.933
Being a family man.

01:22:43.034 --> 01:22:46.036
And you're the final word
of justice here?

01:22:48.239 --> 01:22:51.542
As well as chancellor
and advisor.

01:22:51.643 --> 01:22:55.279
You'll find that nothing passes

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.716
through this shire
without me touching it.

01:22:58.817 --> 01:23:01.151
I'm afraid that's a lesson
I'll have to miss.

01:23:01.252 --> 01:23:03.153
I move on after tomorrow.

01:23:03.254 --> 01:23:05.322
Ah, but that's my news.

01:23:05.423 --> 01:23:09.593
You and your soldier
will stay on.

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:12.162
Your position is now standing.

01:23:16.734 --> 01:23:19.136
We're journeyman.

01:23:19.237 --> 01:23:21.004
Travelers.

01:23:21.106 --> 01:23:22.805
Now, you have a home.

01:23:22.906 --> 01:23:26.842
I'm sure that will be
a comfort to your

01:23:26.943 --> 01:23:29.912
wife and wee things.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:36.152
(breathing loudly)

01:23:43.793 --> 01:23:46.228
Why are you doing this?

01:23:48.897 --> 01:23:51.733
Our buried truths bind us.

01:23:51.834 --> 01:23:54.736
And your skills
will serve me.

01:24:00.943 --> 01:24:03.345
I need a man

01:24:03.446 --> 01:24:05.747
with the heart
of a dragon.

01:24:30.205 --> 01:24:32.606
(scratching)

01:24:34.842 --> 01:24:37.277
(soft gasp)

01:24:39.547 --> 01:24:41.982
ANNORA:
Ludwig?

01:24:53.661 --> 01:24:56.063
(shallow breathing)

01:25:09.543 --> 01:25:13.246
We need to ready our faith.

01:25:13.347 --> 01:25:18.117
(shakily):
<i>Ja, meine Liebe.</i>

01:25:24.225 --> 01:25:26.593
(breathing shakily)

01:25:43.732 --> 01:25:46.167
<i>Ego auctoritate</i>

01:25:46.268 --> 01:25:49.337
<i>ipsius te absolvo</i>

01:25:49.438 --> 01:25:53.707
<i>ab omni vinculo excommunicationis
et interdicti...</i>

01:25:53.808 --> 01:25:56.777
- (boys singing chant in Latin)
<i>- ...in quantum possum</i>

01:25:56.877 --> 01:25:59.713
<i>- et tu indiges.</i>
<i>- (groaning)</i>

01:25:59.814 --> 01:26:02.949
<i>Ego te absolvo</i>

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:06.019
<i>a peccatis tuis</i>

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.822
<i>in nomine Patris,</i>
<i>et Filii,</i>

01:26:08.923 --> 01:26:10.589
<i>et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>

01:26:15.195 --> 01:26:18.230
(Randulf groaning)

01:26:24.705 --> 01:26:27.105
(singing chant continues)

01:26:32.911 --> 01:26:35.279
Blades have been grinded, sir.

01:26:44.622 --> 01:26:46.957
(groans softly)

01:27:05.075 --> 01:27:07.510
(groans softly)

01:27:14.017 --> 01:27:16.385
(singing chant continues)

01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:23.892
(whispering, laughing)

01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:26.328
(inhales deeply)

01:27:26.429 --> 01:27:28.330
(exhales deeply)

01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:30.765
(quietly):
Help me.

01:27:34.069 --> 01:27:36.571
(crowd murmuring)

01:28:17.845 --> 01:28:21.481
Always.

01:28:35.996 --> 01:28:37.429
You'll need this, headsman.

01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:40.299
Little Rand
was full of shit.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.201
(laughter)

01:28:42.302 --> 01:28:44.470
A stuffed clown.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:45.633
(laughter)
