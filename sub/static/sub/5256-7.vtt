<i>it's like, 2 million acres.</i>

02:14.168 --> 02:17.169
I mean, taken from the poor
Native Americans,

02:17.171 --> 02:22.841

give it to some crazy pioneers?

02:22.843 --> 02:25.711
<i>Let them kinda</i>

It's so awful.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.653
We took 2 million acres.

- Wow.
- It's very sad.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.858
But anyways,

<i>Hey, journalist, boss,</i>

<i>what if I went</i>
<i>to this land-run</i>

02:56.844 --> 03:00.445
<i>and I talked about</i>
<i>what girls are wearing</i>

03:00.447 --> 03:02.347
<i>in terms of petticoats?</i>

03:02.349 --> 03:04.349
<i>But in her head is like,</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:07.619
<i>I'm gonna get a piece</i>
<i>of this land for me.</i>

03:07.621 --> 03:09.454
So, she gets there.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.391
<i>There are 50,000 people</i>

03:12.393 --> 03:13.358
<i>lining the border.</i>

goes into the lands as well.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.374
<i>And it's filled</i>
<i>with journalists.</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:30.943
<i>Kentucky Daisey's on the train.</i>

03:30.945 --> 03:31.910
<i>She's trying to keep it cool.</i>

03:31.912 --> 03:34.813
<i>But then, it goes up this</i>
<i>incline so it slows down.</i>

03:34.815 --> 03:37.249
<i>Kentucky Daisey's like,</i>
<i>[bleep] this [bleep].</i>

03:37.251 --> 03:40.419
<i>She jumps off</i>

03:40.421 --> 03:41.653
<i>Over a ditch.</i>

03:41.655 --> 03:44.489
<i>Gets to the plot of land</i>
<i>that she wants,</i>

03:44.491 --> 03:45.390
<i>pulls a stake out--pop!</i>

03:45.392 --> 03:48.393
<i>Claims the land.</i>
<i>Shoots a gun off,</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.329
<i>because, whatever,</i>
<i>that's who she is.</i>

03:50.331 --> 03:52.364
<i>Thus I salute the Ken--</i>

03:52.366 --> 03:53.332
What?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.633
- What?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.668
- The Kentucky Daisey claim.
Thus I salute

03:56.670 --> 03:59.238
the Kentucky Daisey claim!

03:59.240 --> 03:59.871
<i>[mimics gunfire]</i>

03:59.873 --> 04:01.006
<i>She gets the land.</i>

04:01.008 --> 04:03.842
And so, on her little
piece of property,

04:03.844 --> 04:05.410
she builds a house
and whatever,

04:05.412 --> 04:07.446
but she starts to kinda
get that hunger again.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.481
<i>She's like, I'm gonna</i>
<i>go to this next land-run,</i>

04:09.483 --> 04:12.884
<i>and I'm gonna ride a horse in,</i>
<i>like a badass bitch.</i>

04:12.886 --> 04:14.419
<i>Boom!</i>
<i>Cannon goes off.</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:16.555
<i>And she does,</i>
<i>she rides a horse in.</i>

04:16.557 --> 04:17.356
<i>She's super cool.</i>

04:17.358 --> 04:21.393
And then the horse acts like
a [bleep] asshole.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.261
<i>Throws her.</i>

04:22.263 --> 04:25.464
<i>Tromps her face</i>
<i>with its little horse hooves--</i>

04:25.466 --> 04:27.766
<i>- She what?</i>
- Tromped her face.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.334
What do they do?
Trample?

04:29.336 --> 04:30.002
<i>Tramp?</i>

04:30.004 --> 04:31.870
<i>The horse tramped her face?</i>

04:31.872 --> 04:33.572
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>Right?</i>

04:33.574 --> 04:35.407
- Yeah.
- Who cares?

04:35.409 --> 04:36.308
She lost it.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.277
<i>So, she's out.</i>
<i>She's unconscious.</i>

04:38.279 --> 04:40.979
<i>She wakes up, she's like,</i>
<i>Where am I?</i>

04:40.981 --> 04:43.048
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>who cares where I am,</i>

04:43.050 --> 04:44.716
<i>it's land,</i>
<i>I'm gonna claim it.</i>

04:44.718 --> 04:45.851
<i>I don't give a [bleep]</i>
<i>where I am.</i>

04:45.853 --> 04:47.452
<i>Sha-doink.</i>
<i>This is my land.</i>

04:47.454 --> 04:49.488
<i>People next door are like,</i>

04:53.594 --> 04:54.359
<i>You're cray.</i>

04:54.361 --> 04:55.894
Now she's got
two plots of land.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.796
That's it, that's it.
That's the cap.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.599
<i>So, Kentucky Daisey</i>
<i>brought 11 women.</i>

05:00.601 --> 05:04.002

<i>go into these new lands.</i>

05:04.004 --> 05:06.004
<i>We're gonna give you some</i>

05:06.006 --> 05:09.341
<i>Like, have at it.</i>
<i>This is for us.</i>

05:09.343 --> 05:10.409
<i>This is lady land.</i>

05:10.411 --> 05:13.979
<i>Let's put up some houses,</i>
<i>establish some lady property.</i>

05:13.981 --> 05:15.881
<i>Put a hot tub up.</i>
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>

05:15.883 --> 05:20.085
<i>These bitches are [bleep]</i>
<i>rifled up.</i>

05:20.087 --> 05:23.588
<i>They're called Daisey's Amazons</i>
<i>by "The New York Times."</i>

05:23.590 --> 05:25.791
So, they go in there--
here's the crazy part,

05:25.793 --> 05:27.826
you're supposed to go
in at noon,

05:27.828 --> 05:30.629
that's the time,
but they go in days early--

05:30.631 --> 05:31.596
<i>which is illegal.</i>

05:31.598 --> 05:32.397
<i>That's like a thing.</i>

05:32.399 --> 05:34.933
Those people
were called sooners.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.901
<i>And they hide in a ditch.</i>

05:35.903 --> 05:37.602
<i>So, their whole thing is like,</i>

05:37.604 --> 05:40.505
<i>if like a [bleep] dude</i>
<i>runs up on you tonight,</i>

05:40.507 --> 05:43.642

<i>And the guys in charge</i>

<i>No, not cool.</i>
<i>We're gonna capture you.</i>

<i>on these 11 ladies that were</i>
<i>hiding in the ditch.</i>

06:13.540 --> 06:15.640
<i>And they ended up being</i>

06:15.642 --> 06:18.944
I'm gonna throw up--I'm not!

06:18.946 --> 06:20.912
People underestimate

06:20.914 --> 06:24.549
Wine is a very...it--high

06:24.551 --> 06:26.051
- I agree.

This is the best.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.837
That's what she said.
She was like,

06:45.839 --> 06:47.806
[bleep] blow into these
territories

06:47.808 --> 06:52.944
and make a bunch of women

<i>Gordon Cooper, he's this</i>
<i>military test pilot</i>

08:27.107 --> 08:28.006
<i>from Oklahoma.</i>

08:28.008 --> 08:29.407
<i>NASA had just begun.</i>

08:29.409 --> 08:31.776
<i>And so, he was</i>
<i>one of seven astronauts</i>

08:31.778 --> 08:33.912
<i>chosen for Project Mercury.</i>

08:33.914 --> 08:35.080
Also, really chill.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.517
<i>He was like,</i>
<i>Please, call me Gordo.</i>

08:38.519 --> 08:40.185
<i>Don't call me Gordon.</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:41.386
<i>I'm not that official.</i>

08:41.388 --> 08:44.923
Right? And so, all these
space missions go off

08:44.925 --> 08:45.991
without a hitch,
and NASA's like,

08:45.993 --> 08:48.960
We've done really well.
Congrats, NASA.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.296
<i>And they're patting themselves</i>
<i>on the back.</i>

08:51.298 --> 08:53.298
<i>And Gordo's like,</i>
<i>Guys, I totally get it.</i>

08:53.300 --> 08:56.201
<i>Like, that's really cool,</i>
<i>like, pats on the back.</i>

08:56.203 --> 09:01.072
<i>But if you want</i>
<i>to send a man to the moon,</i>

09:01.074 --> 09:04.075
<i>you should maybe</i>
<i>see if someone could</i>

09:04.077 --> 09:07.145
<i>be in space for,</i>
<i>I don't know, 24 hours.</i>

09:07.147 --> 09:10.882
<i>And NASA's like,</i>
<i>Ugh, yeah I guess, Gus.</i>

09:10.884 --> 09:12.450
<i>Yeah, sure, Gus.</i>

09:12.452 --> 09:14.286
<i>- Gordo.</i>
<i>- Oh, [bleep], sorry.</i>

09:14.288 --> 09:15.287
I'm an idiot.
<i>- That's okay.</i>

09:15.289 --> 09:16.988
<i>- All right, all right.</i>
<i>- You're fine.</i>

09:16.990 --> 09:18.957
<i>- So, Gordo goes on</i>
<i>the launch pad.</i>

09:18.959 --> 09:22.127
<i>NASA'd be like,</i>
<i>Hey, just like, really quick...</i>

09:22.129 --> 09:23.094
<i>Like, don't touch anything.</i>

09:23.096 --> 09:25.263
<i>NASA would completely control</i>
<i>everything.</i>

09:25.265 --> 09:28.099
It was so bad that
the astronauts felt like, um,

09:28.101 --> 09:29.901
spam in a can.
- [chuckles]

09:29.903 --> 09:32.103
- Is what they referred
to themselves as.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.106
<i>So, anyway, he launches</i>
<i>into space and it's like,</i>

09:35.108 --> 09:39.311
<i>Three, two, one, blast off.</i>

09:39.313 --> 09:42.847
<i>[mimics rocket firing]</i>

09:45.918 --> 09:49.487
Are you shooting that...
Okay, good.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.323
<i>He gets up into space</i>
<i>and everything's cool.</i>

09:51.325 --> 09:54.492
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>I'm orbiting the [bleep] Earth.</i>

09:54.494 --> 09:56.995
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, I wa--</i>
<i>- You can swear.</i>

09:56.997 --> 09:58.296
<i>- No, my mom--</i>
<i>I try not--</i>

09:58.298 --> 10:00.432
<i>I'm not--</i>
<i>I'm gonna try not to swear.</i>

10:00.434 --> 10:01.232
So, he's in space.

10:01.234 --> 10:05.937
<i>He sends back the first TV</i>
<i>images of a human,</i>

10:05.939 --> 10:06.605
<i>back to Earth.</i>

10:06.607 --> 10:10.976
<i>He has a little</i>
<i>powdered roast beef dinner.</i>

10:10.978 --> 10:14.012
<i>He's just having a ball.</i>

10:14.014 --> 10:15.513
So, he takes a nap.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.583
<i>The first guy to ever sleep</i>
<i>in space.</i>

10:18.585 --> 10:21.252
<i>He wakes up and he's like,</i>
<i>It's good to be Gordo.</i>

10:21.254 --> 10:25.023
<i>And then, he's like,</i>
<i>Oh, [bleep], no, it's not.</i>

10:25.025 --> 10:27.926
<i>Because...beep, beep.</i>

10:27.928 --> 10:30.895
<i>Oh...[bleep].</i>

10:30.897 --> 10:34.165
<i>I have</i>
<i>no stabilization unit.</i>

10:34.500 --> 10:37.369
<i>Everyone in Mission Control</i>
<i>is freaking out.</i>

10:37.371 --> 10:38.970
<i>They're like,</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:39.871
<i>This doesn't look good.</i>

10:39.873 --> 10:42.307
<i>And Gus Grissom is like,</i>
<i>Bro, I love you.</i>

10:42.309 --> 10:44.242
<i>I'm gonna tell your wife</i>
<i>you're a hero.</i>

10:44.244 --> 10:46.044
<i>Gordo's like,</i>
<i>No, stop it.</i>

10:46.046 --> 10:49.514
<i>I'm gonna take control</i>
<i>over the spaceship.</i>

10:49.516 --> 10:52.584
<i>Gus is like, You're</i>
<i>about to do something none of--</i>

10:52.586 --> 10:54.085
<i>no one has ever done before.</i>

10:54.087 --> 10:56.021
And Gordo's like,
Yeah, no, I know.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.056
<i>So, just shut</i>
<i>the [bleep] up, Gus.</i>

10:58.058 --> 11:00.025
<i>I've got control.</i>

11:00.027 --> 11:04.329
<i>He starts to take over</i>
<i>manual control.</i>

11:04.331 --> 11:08.199
<i>But, at that moment, he loses</i>
<i>radio signal with Gus Grissom.</i>

11:08.201 --> 11:10.435
<i>And so, he gets a radio signal</i>

11:10.437 --> 11:12.404
<i>over to his friend John Glenn,</i>

11:12.406 --> 11:15.640
<i>who's on the recovery boat</i>
<i>over in Japan.</i>

11:15.642 --> 11:17.642
<i>Then he's like,</i>
<i>John Glenn, hey.</i>

11:17.644 --> 11:18.476
<i>It's me, Gordo.</i>

11:18.478 --> 11:22.580
<i>Um, I have absolutely no power</i>
<i>in my spacecraft.</i>

11:22.582 --> 11:24.215
<i>And I just wanna get back home</i>

11:24.217 --> 11:26.551
<i>because I'm a really chill guy.</i>
<i>It's me, Gordo.</i>

11:26.553 --> 11:28.520
<i>And he's like, Okay,</i>
<i>here's what we're gonna do.</i>

11:28.522 --> 11:30.922
<i>And so, together they go</i>
<i>through this checklist.</i>

11:30.924 --> 11:34.292
<i>Uh, put this thing up.</i>

11:34.294 --> 11:35.593
<i>Like, press this button.</i>

11:35.595 --> 11:37.662
<i>There's all these things</i>
<i>he needs to do.</i>

11:37.664 --> 11:39.230
<i>But then Gordo's like,</i>
<i>Oh, [bleep].</i>

11:39.232 --> 11:43.401
Beep. And his carbon dioxide
meter's going off.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.004
And it's like,
Beep, beep, you're [bleep].

11:46.006 --> 11:48.306
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>Oh, my God, you're right.</i>

11:48.308 --> 11:49.274
<i>I'm totally [bleep] [bleep].</i>

11:49.276 --> 11:52.010
<i>But I--no, but he's chiller</i>
<i>than that.</i>

11:52.012 --> 11:55.380
No, hold on.
He's way calmer than that.

11:56.215 --> 12:00.251
<i>John Glenn, look,</i>
<i>my carbon dioxide meter's</i>

12:00.253 --> 12:02.087
<i>going off and, uh...</i>

12:02.089 --> 12:04.355
<i>It's like 100 degrees</i>
<i>in my cabin.</i>

12:04.357 --> 12:06.558
Which means
he's [bleep] dying.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.060
But he's not being
a Debbie Downer about it.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.696
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>I need to get to Earth.</i>

12:11.698 --> 12:15.734
<i>But, like, manual reentry</i>
<i>had never been done before.</i>

12:15.736 --> 12:18.269
So, if he enters the
Earth's atmosphere too steep,

12:18.271 --> 12:20.038
he's gonna blow up.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.206
<i>So, he says, Okay.</i>

12:21.208 --> 12:24.442
<i>There's the Big Dipper.</i>
<i>There's the Little Dipper.</i>

12:24.444 --> 12:25.410
<i>Gemini...</i>

12:25.412 --> 12:28.146
He draws an axis
on the window

12:28.148 --> 12:32.050
and uses the constellations
as his constant.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.487
<i>And he says,</i>
<i>This is going to be my angle</i>

12:35.489 --> 12:37.222
<i>at which I can enter</i>
<i>Earth's atmosphere.</i>

12:37.224 --> 12:40.191
<i>Which I think is...</i>
<i>pretty incredible.</i>

12:40.193 --> 12:42.026
<i>So, John Glenn is like,</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

12:42.028 --> 12:44.329
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six--</i>

12:44.331 --> 12:47.565
<i>Gordo's like, Let's just,</i>
<i>like, do it, I'm ready.</i>

12:47.567 --> 12:50.535
So, he fires, uh...

12:50.537 --> 12:51.169
[grunts]

12:51.171 --> 12:53.371
<i>Uh, what does this mean?</i>

12:53.373 --> 12:55.240
[laughs]

12:55.242 --> 12:57.542
- [chuckling]
- What's it called when there's

12:57.544 --> 12:59.744
fire coming out of stuff?

12:59.746 --> 13:03.314
What--when it's like a fire...

13:03.316 --> 13:04.315
[groans]

13:04.317 --> 13:05.049
[laughs]

13:05.051 --> 13:08.453
<i>He fires the rockets.</i>

13:08.455 --> 13:10.622
<i>[mimics rocket blast]</i>

13:10.624 --> 13:13.391
<i>He had a $5 wristwatch,</i>
<i>and that's what he used</i>

13:13.393 --> 13:17.562
<i>to figure out how long</i>
<i>to fire his rockets.</i>

13:17.564 --> 13:18.630
<i>[mimics rocket blast]</i>

13:18.632 --> 13:22.200
<i>Gordo is like, I'm entering</i>
<i>Earth's atmosphere!</i>

13:22.202 --> 13:25.470
<i>[bleep] bravo to me!</i>

13:27.139 --> 13:29.274
<i>- Wait.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

13:31.744 --> 13:34.479
[both laugh]

13:34.481 --> 13:35.413
<i>- And he splashes down.</i>

13:35.415 --> 13:40.351
<i>And he has the most accurate</i>
<i>splash-down, ever,</i>

13:40.353 --> 13:43.121
<i>in...NASA history.</i>

13:44.390 --> 13:45.824
<i>He's like, so chill.</i>

13:45.826 --> 13:47.425
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>Hey, guys, I made it.</i>

13:47.427 --> 13:53.231
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>
<i>It's me, Gordo.</i>

13:53.233 --> 13:55.233
<i>Big whoop.</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:02.640
<i>Gordo changed the game.</i>

14:02.642 --> 14:03.608
- Great.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.810
- He had a $5 wristwatch.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.683
<i>- All right, Mark.</i>
<i>- I'm listening.</i>

14:11.685 --> 14:14.652
<i>- Well, you're gonna</i>
<i>do some talking.</i>

14:14.654 --> 14:15.720
- Hello.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.288
- I'm Mark Gagliardi.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.690
- I'm Mark Gagliardi.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.425
- And today,
we're gonna talk about...

14:20.427 --> 14:21.593
- Oh, is this really
that part of the thing?

14:21.595 --> 14:24.829
<i>- Yep.</i>
- Yeah, now you're woken up.

14:24.831 --> 14:25.430
Here he comes.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.565
- This is how television works,
bitches.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.433
- Ready?
<i>- Which camera?</i>

14:28.435 --> 14:30.835
- Action.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.904
- Hi, I'm Mark Gagliardi.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.707
<i>[glass crashes]</i>
Today we're gonna talk about

14:35.709 --> 14:36.975
Bass Reeves.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.278
- [laughs]

14:41.447 --> 14:44.349
<i>- Bass Reeves is born</i>
<i>as a slave.</i>

14:44.351 --> 14:45.316
<i>One night,</i>

14:45.318 --> 14:48.386
<i>Bass Reeves and his master</i>

14:48.388 --> 14:51.456
<i>get in an argument</i>
<i>over a poker game.</i>

14:51.458 --> 14:53.591
<i>Bass Reeves...</i>

14:53.593 --> 14:56.494
<i>punches his owner</i>
<i>in the face.</i>

14:56.496 --> 14:59.364
<i>And Bass Reaves</i>
<i>thinks to himself,</i>

14:59.366 --> 15:04.369
<i>Oh, [bleep], you guys,</i>
<i>I just coldcocked my boss.</i>

15:04.371 --> 15:07.071
<i>Listen, let's be honest,</i>
<i>my owner.</i>

15:07.073 --> 15:10.074
<i>This is probably not</i>
<i>gonna be good for me.</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:12.610
<i>So, Bass Reeves hightails it</i>

15:12.612 --> 15:15.480
<i>to the Indian Territories</i>
<i>of Oklahoma.</i>

15:15.482 --> 15:18.917
So, Bass Reeves
winds up living among

15:18.919 --> 15:19.884
the Seminole Nation,

15:19.886 --> 15:23.488
learning the language of all
of these indigenous peoples.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.858
<i>And trained in the ways</i>
<i>of Native American</i>

15:26.860 --> 15:29.093
<i>tracking and hunting.</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:29.761
<i>- Hmm, awesome.</i>

15:29.763 --> 15:33.665
- Ah, I appreciate you,
Derek.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.099
<i>I love you.</i>
- I love you.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.968
<i>- You're my--listen, I'm--</i>

15:36.970 --> 15:38.836
<i>We're gonna make a baby.</i>

15:38.838 --> 15:40.405
- Um...
[both laugh]

15:40.407 --> 15:42.440
- I may be aimed down at the
ground for the whole of this,

15:42.442 --> 15:45.410
but don't worry about that.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.546
<i>In 1875 the U.S. is changing.</i>

15:48.548 --> 15:51.516
<i>Taming the Wild West</i>
<i>and all that kinda [bleep].</i>

15:51.518 --> 15:56.387
<i>U.S. Marshal James Fagan knew</i>
<i>that this was dangerous work.</i>

15:56.389 --> 15:59.390
<i>He needed the guy that</i>

15:59.392 --> 16:01.559
<i>full on dances with wolvesed</i>
<i>in that area.</i>

16:01.561 --> 16:04.495
<i>- [laughs]</i>
<i>- So, Fagan goes to Reeves.</i>

16:04.497 --> 16:09.968
<i>Hey, I have 75,000 square miles</i>
<i>to cover</i>

16:09.970 --> 16:12.737
<i>to bring bad guys to justice.</i>

16:12.739 --> 16:14.605
<i>And Bass Reeves said,</i>

16:14.607 --> 16:16.574
<i>Listen, I'm ambidextrous,</i>

16:16.576 --> 16:20.078
<i>I can shoot a gun</i>
<i>with both hands.</i>

16:20.080 --> 16:24.549
<i>I'm 6'2" and 390 pounds.</i>

16:24.551 --> 16:28.653
<i>I'm gonna be the guy</i>
<i>that keeps you safe.</i>

16:28.655 --> 16:32.790
<i>The only thing I can say</i>
<i>to you is...</i>

16:33.425 --> 16:35.927
I'm gonna tape a--take a nap.
[bleep] you.

16:35.929 --> 16:39.564
<i>- ♪ There he goes</i>
<i>on the floor ♪</i>

16:39.566 --> 16:41.599
- Derek?
- Mm-hmm?

16:41.601 --> 16:42.533
- Take my hand.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.870
- Good night, then.

16:45.872 --> 16:46.871
- Night.

16:46.873 --> 16:47.505
So...

16:49.408 --> 16:53.077
<i>So, Bass Reeves is working</i>
<i>as a U.S. Marshal,</i>

16:53.079 --> 16:54.178
<i>picking up bad guys.</i>

16:54.180 --> 16:58.049
So, one of the bad guy things
that he does is,

16:58.051 --> 17:00.985
he dresses himself up
as an old beggar

17:00.987 --> 17:05.857
at the homestead of
a couple of bad guys' mother.

17:05.859 --> 17:10.128
<i>He says,</i>
<i>I'm just a poor old beggar.</i>

17:10.130 --> 17:12.597
<i>I just need a place to stay</i>
<i>for the night.</i>

17:12.599 --> 17:17.001
<i>So she gives Bass Reeves</i>
<i>a place to spend the night.</i>

17:17.003 --> 17:19.604
<i>As soon as the two outlaws</i>
<i>fell asleep,</i>

17:19.606 --> 17:23.941
<i>Bass Reeves</i>
<i>pulled down his shawl,</i>

17:23.943 --> 17:25.610
<i>grabs his six shooter.</i>

17:25.612 --> 17:27.779
He says,
The Bass w--hold on.

17:27.781 --> 17:30.882
<i>I'm gonna corner</i>
<i>their dumb asses</i>

17:30.884 --> 17:31.716
<i>while they're sleeping.</i>

17:31.718 --> 17:33.584
I'll sleep you--

17:33.586 --> 17:37.889
<i>I will sleep clack you</i>
<i>into my handcuffs, bitches!</i>

17:37.891 --> 17:39.857
<i>And I'm gonna grag you...</i>

17:39.859 --> 17:43.027
I'm gonna grag you--hold on.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.596
<i>I'm gonna drag your asses</i>
<i>in jail</i>

17:45.598 --> 17:47.832
<i>where I gathered up</i>
<i>all the criminals.</i>

17:47.834 --> 17:50.635
<i>- That's pretty badass.</i>
- Listen, mother[bleep],

17:50.637 --> 17:52.637
I'll tell you this whole story,
hold on.

17:52.639 --> 17:56.107
This is how big a badass
Bass Reeves is.

17:56.109 --> 18:00.211
<i>The Brunter Brothers,</i>
<i>another group of outlaws,</i>

18:00.213 --> 18:01.646
<i>ambushed him at gunpoint.</i>

18:01.648 --> 18:04.582
<i>Bass Reeves kept his cool,</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:07.585
<i>turned to the first</i>
<i>Brunter Brother and said,</i>

18:07.587 --> 18:11.189
<i>I'm sorry, do you know what</i>
<i>the date is today?</i>

18:11.191 --> 18:13.925
<i>And as that brother was</i>
<i>trying to figure out</i>

18:13.927 --> 18:14.992
<i>the date for the day,</i>

18:14.994 --> 18:18.196
<i>Bass Reeves shoots</i>
<i>the first two brothers.</i>

18:18.198 --> 18:20.731
And then coldcocked
the other brother

18:20.733 --> 18:23.935
and carried them back
to the court at Fort Lewis.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.037
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

18:26.039 --> 18:27.705
<i>[bleep] you,</i>
<i>Bass Reeves!</i>

18:27.707 --> 18:30.675
<i>[bleep] you and your knowing</i>
<i>what's right and wrong!</i>

18:30.677 --> 18:32.944
[bleep] you, Honest...

18:32.946 --> 18:35.146
Honest Jack Reeves!

18:35.148 --> 18:35.947
[bleep] you,
Bass Reeves,

18:35.949 --> 18:40.518
and your wanting to give
the honesty to the people!

18:40.520 --> 18:42.753
- Mark.
- I love you.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.690
- [laughing]

18:45.692 --> 18:47.525
- I love you.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.026
I'ma kiss you on your lips.

18:49.028 --> 18:49.994
<i>Derek Waters.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

18:49.996 --> 18:54.298
<i>- I'ma kiss you on your lips.</i>

18:54.300 --> 18:55.199
- I just wanna
hold your face.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.902
- Will you finish
the story if I do this?

18:57.904 --> 18:59.203
- I promise
I will.

18:59.205 --> 18:59.971
- Promise?
- I'm--

18:59.973 --> 19:01.439
- No slapping.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.407
- I'm not gonna slap you,
Derek.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.242
- What're you
gonna do?

19:04.244 --> 19:09.180
- Derek?
[sighs]

19:09.182 --> 19:10.248
- That was
very nice.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.149
- I'm gonna
take a nap now.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.484
- Nope. You promised,
if you could touch my face...

19:13.486 --> 19:14.952
- I'll touch your face.
- You were gonna finish

19:14.954 --> 19:18.055
the [bleep] story.
- I'ma finish it, hold on.

19:18.057 --> 19:18.956
<i>So, uh, one night,</i>

19:18.958 --> 19:22.026
<i>Bass Reeves is chasing after</i>
<i>Jim Webb.</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:26.130
<i>He'd killed a ton of dudes,</i>

19:26.132 --> 19:27.465
<i>pew, pew, pew--</i>

19:27.467 --> 19:29.467
<i>shot down this dude.</i>

19:29.469 --> 19:31.936
<i>And this guy is laying there,</i>
<i>on the ground,</i>

19:31.938 --> 19:33.871
<i>looks up at Bass Reeves,</i>
<i>and he says,</i>

19:33.873 --> 19:40.344
<i>Bass, this bullet</i>
<i>that is designed for you...</i>

19:40.346 --> 19:41.812
<i>Nah, man.</i>

19:41.814 --> 19:45.349
<i>I want this bullet</i>
<i>to be designed</i>

19:45.351 --> 19:47.985
<i>for people that [bleep] you up.</i>

19:47.987 --> 19:50.955
<i>That guy, Jim Webb,</i>
<i>gave that gun to Bass Reeves</i>

19:50.957 --> 19:54.192
<i>because he respects him.</i>

19:54.194 --> 19:55.526
Derek.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.929
- Shh.
Tell the story.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.397
- I love you.
- I love you.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.465
<i>- Bass Reeves threw</i>
<i>more men in jail</i>

20:01.467 --> 20:04.368
<i>than any other Marshal</i>
<i>in U.S. history,</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.970
<i>3,000 men.</i>

20:05.972 --> 20:07.305

20:07.307 --> 20:09.307

20:29.862 --> 20:33.264

20:33.266 --> 20:34.131
<i>for the Lone Ranger.</i>

20:34.133 --> 20:37.935
- How come more people
don't know that Bass Reeves

is who inspired
the Lone Ranger?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.039
- Because he's black.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.041
- That's sad.
- Yeah.
