what does our future hold?

Excuse me, who drops in
someone's lamp unannounced?

00:19.561 --> 00:21.271
Sorry.
I didn't even know

00:21.271 --> 00:23.065
you could drop in
to someone's lamp.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.067
You can't be here
dressed like that.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.277
‐Your lamp has a dress code?
‐Jordan: Of course.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.695
I don't live
in a jar.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.155
Ben, I'll spare you.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.490
No dude has
been able to rock

00:31.490 --> 00:34.201
the harem pants
since, well, my dad.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.452
‐Thanks?
‐(snaps fingers)

00:37.079 --> 00:38.163
Cute!

00:38.163 --> 00:40.249
Except if it were me,
I'd probably add

00:40.249 --> 00:41.583
a little more bling here,

00:41.583 --> 00:43.418
‐a little more
sparkle over there...
‐Jordan: Ahem.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.795
Evie:
No?

00:44.795 --> 00:46.296
That's cool.
I'm good.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.215
Chiffon? Really?

00:48.215 --> 00:50.008
You are not
getting this back.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.843
(gasps)
Wait a minute...

00:51.843 --> 00:53.303
are we in Auradon?

00:53.303 --> 00:54.471
No matter where we are,

00:54.471 --> 00:56.807
I look perfect, per ushe.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.016
Ben:
So wait,
if we're in a lamp...

00:58.016 --> 01:00.727
then we must be
really tiny right now.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.771
Nothing gets
past King Obvious.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.231
King Obviously Cute.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.775
‐That is my legal name.
‐(sneeze)

01:06.775 --> 01:08.360
‐What was that?
‐Uh...

01:08.360 --> 01:09.695
I‐‐ I sneezed.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.280
I'm allergic to lamps.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.322
It's hereditary.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.991
Yeah, I have allergies too.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.951
‐Get it from my dad.
‐I get dolls from my dad.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.161
‐Aww, that's‐‐
‐Voodoo curse dolls.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.496
‐Terrifying.
‐Yeah.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.207
My dad's all about
the other side.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.751
‐Uh... it's good
to have a hobby.
‐He's so obsessed

01:24.751 --> 01:27.129
with ghosts that he knows
all of their deathdays,

01:27.129 --> 01:28.714
but he can never
remember my birthday.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.299
My dad loves birthdays.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.259
He even made up
this funny birthday dance.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.302
I wish you could see it.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.012
Oh, how I wish.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.430
I mean, now that
I'm here and all,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.808
it would be such a hoot,
but I'm sure there's no room

01:39.808 --> 01:43.228
for another abominable villain
in your beloved Auradon.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.855
I'll just have to
envision your father's

01:44.855 --> 01:46.898
birthday promenade
in my dreams.

01:46.898 --> 01:47.941
Sigh.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.192
How would you feel
about coming

01:49.192 --> 01:50.527
to Auradon Prep?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.487
‐Another one?
‐Ben, that's really

01:52.487 --> 01:54.489
‐nice of you, but‐‐
‐I'd love to!

01:55.949 --> 01:58.076
‐(gasps)
‐We'll have to set you up
with a roommate and‐‐

01:58.076 --> 01:59.328
Jordan:
As much as I enjoy watching

01:59.328 --> 02:02.372
a new student register,
can we do this later?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.957
Like, maybe
not around me

02:03.957 --> 02:05.667
and maybe not
in my house?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.836
‐I'm telling you to go.
‐Okay.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.879
How do we get out
of here?

02:08.879 --> 02:09.963
Jordan:
The same way you got in.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.340
Wish your way out.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.758
Wish number three?

02:12.758 --> 02:14.134
Bye!

02:14.134 --> 02:16.720
You really want to waste
your last wish on getting out?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.347
Jordan:
If you stay here
any longer,

02:18.347 --> 02:20.432
it's all you're going
to be wishing for.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.767
Thanks for dropping by!

02:21.767 --> 02:24.102
‐Don't let the lid hit
you on the way out!
‐Okay.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.437
I wish us all out of here.
