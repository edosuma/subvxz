WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY KIM Kwang-sik

01:14.974 --> 01:17.743
<i>Tang Dynasty's Emperor Taizong
was called the 'god of war'.</i>

01:18.411 --> 01:21.747
<i>He led 200,000 soldiers
to invade Goguryeo.</i>

01:22.615 --> 01:28.220
<i>Many fortresses along the border</i>

01:28.688 --> 01:31.190
<i>fell instantly to Taizong.</i>

01:33.159 --> 01:36.862
<i>Goguryeo General Yeon
dispatched 150,000 men</i>

01:36.863 --> 01:39.865
<i>to face Taizong at Mt. Jupil.</i>

01:41.968 --> 01:46.371
<i>Goguryeo's fate depended on it.</i>

02:02.055 --> 02:04.389
Cadets! Do not fall behind!

02:13.900 --> 02:22.241
<i>Field of Mt. Jupil</i>

02:28.615 --> 02:29.982
Archers!

02:32.785 --> 02:33.685
Fire!

03:03.516 --> 03:04.650
Shields!

03:38.184 --> 03:44.156
Goguryeo cavalry unit's morale is high.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.494
What did I tell you?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.364
Our gods will not abandon us!

04:21.827 --> 04:26.531
Emperor, at this rate, our
army will be annihilated.

04:26.866 --> 04:30.602
No, they will hold their ground.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.942
Hold your ground!

04:41.814 --> 04:42.881
Hold your ground!

04:46.185 --> 04:47.953
Kill them!

04:51.724 --> 04:52.991
Attack!

04:57.063 --> 04:57.929
Enemies!

04:58.531 --> 05:00.265
Enemies from the rear!

05:02.702 --> 05:03.468
It's a trap!

05:03.770 --> 05:05.537
Taizong hid his men!

05:08.975 --> 05:10.175
Now!

05:10.276 --> 05:12.077
Full assault!

05:51.951 --> 05:53.385
Drag him down!

06:06.866 --> 06:07.966
Do not disperse!

06:08.405 --> 06:10.969
Maintain formation!

06:38.731 --> 06:40.031
You okay?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.954
We'll be wiped out, we must retreat!

07:04.157 --> 07:08.093
This is exactly what Holy
King Jumong showed me

07:38.691 --> 07:40.425
Samul! Samul!

07:43.429 --> 07:46.965
The retreat flag is raised,
we have to leave at once!

07:48.634 --> 07:49.601
Samul!

07:59.846 --> 08:02.314
No, please!

08:04.650 --> 08:08.520
It's okay, you'll be fine...

08:49.449 --> 08:53.151
The majority of our 150,000
men died during battle,

08:53.697 --> 08:57.900
and less than 10,000 have survived.

09:07.013 --> 09:10.549
Almost there, just hold on.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.829
General Yeon...

09:30.436 --> 09:31.403
Drop him.

09:32.104 --> 09:35.974
It's okay, I'll carry him back.

09:37.944 --> 09:38.910
He's dead.

10:11.163 --> 10:13.578
Who is this woman?

10:13.981 --> 10:17.216
She is the Goguryeo medium we captured.

10:18.577 --> 10:22.580
She is said to see the visions of the gods.

10:23.451 --> 10:24.317
Don't touch!

10:25.310 --> 10:26.744
This is Goguryeo's holy relic!

10:26.883 --> 10:31.179
These were used by Jumong,
the founder of Goguryeo Kingdom.

10:31.542 --> 10:35.193
She brought these to the
battle as a symbol of victory.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.718
It's made of obsidian.

10:41.030 --> 10:44.364
Lighter than iron, these will fly far.

10:51.105 --> 10:54.896
Your Majesty, it is said that
no one can wield this bow.

10:59.918 --> 11:02.952
Anymore roadblocks to the capital?

11:03.291 --> 11:06.615
Just Ansi Fortress, Emperor.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.199
Ansi Fortress?

11:08.248 --> 11:13.555
We may be able to seize
it without bloodshed.

11:13.879 --> 11:14.879
How so?

11:15.307 --> 11:21.112
There's a rumor that Yeon despises
the Ansi Commander, Yang.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.149
When General Yeon overthrew the king
and called for all the commanders,

11:24.150 --> 11:27.886
he did not respond.

11:28.092 --> 11:30.487
He dares to defy General Yeon?

11:30.990 --> 11:34.659
According to a captured
Goguryeo officer,

11:35.027 --> 11:38.697
this woman has special ties to Yang.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.565
Explain.

11:40.933 --> 11:46.938
Before she became a medium,
they were engaged.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.037
Is that so?

11:51.091 --> 11:52.477
It's a good sign!

11:55.221 --> 11:57.989
Nothing will stop us now!

11:58.502 --> 12:02.438
Take over Ansi Fortress
and march to the capital!

12:02.988 --> 12:06.357
Yes, Emperor!

12:11.430 --> 12:16.067
Have you met Yang Manchun?

12:16.969 --> 12:19.070
We're both from Ansi,

12:19.972 --> 12:22.674
but when I was a child, he was
already fighting in wars,

12:23.576 --> 12:25.310
and when he came back,

12:26.278 --> 12:29.314
I was in the capital, so
we've never crossed paths.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.049
Even so,

12:34.353 --> 12:37.155
you know him by reputation, don't you?

12:38.023 --> 12:43.762
He was once known as a warrior
who won many battles.

12:45.564 --> 12:49.734
But he's now called a traitor.

12:50.202 --> 12:56.274
So many of my men died
on the battlefield.

12:57.309 --> 13:01.279
And where was Yang?

13:01.398 --> 13:04.099
As if defying me wasn't enough,

13:04.984 --> 13:07.819
he cowered away from this battle.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.226
What say you?

13:14.260 --> 13:15.894
It is unforgivable!

13:17.029 --> 13:18.730
I called you here for this reason.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.901
Despite your origin in Ansi,

13:23.536 --> 13:26.204
I made you the head of the cadet unit,

13:26.605 --> 13:31.843
because you're loyal,
unlike Yang Manchun.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.578
Absolutely, General!

13:34.113 --> 13:38.283
Samul, go to Ansi.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.518
You mean...

13:40.653 --> 13:45.557
Penetrate Ansi Fortress and kill Yang.

13:49.395 --> 13:52.197
But the Tang army is headed for Ansi.

13:52.264 --> 13:56.534
Ansi Fortress is no match
for the Tang army.

13:58.437 --> 14:01.472
Larger fortresses have
already fallen to Taizong.

14:02.842 --> 14:07.178
We will abandon Ansi.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.315
But the Ansi people...

14:10.649 --> 14:15.053
As long as they follow Yang,
they are also traitors.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.192
We'll reach the capital.

14:21.994 --> 14:28.199
I'll gather my remaining men
and face the Tang army there.

14:28.934 --> 14:34.439
Kill traitor Yang and
rejoin us in the capital.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.847
Can you do it?

14:50.122 --> 14:51.756
I swear on my life

14:53.559 --> 14:55.593
to accomplish your mission.

16:24.414 --> 16:25.147
Who are you?

16:26.049 --> 16:28.251
Sheath your sword,
we're Goguryeo soldiers.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.026
So you're going to Ansi?

16:36.662 --> 16:37.929
Let us come with you.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.303
The Tang army is headed that way.

16:45.771 --> 16:49.507
Even if we run and stay alive,
we'll be labeled cowards.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.910
We'll fight again, please take us.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.566
Easy, easy.

17:03.052 --> 17:03.675
Easy.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.259
That's the Ansi Fortress.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.596
We'll get there around the hill.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.241
- Pull harder.
- I am.

17:24.609 --> 17:25.643
Hey there!

17:27.146 --> 17:28.346
Over here!

17:31.683 --> 17:34.118
Give us a hand!

17:37.823 --> 17:39.654
Oh jeez...

17:43.929 --> 17:45.696
Come on, buddy.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.900
Put your back into it!

17:49.279 --> 17:50.300
Can't you see that I am?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.305
Just gonna stand there?

18:14.660 --> 18:15.993
That did it.

18:18.664 --> 18:19.764
Thank you.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.099
Are you from Ansi?

18:22.367 --> 18:23.935
I'd like to greet the commander.

18:24.703 --> 18:25.970
Will you guide us to him?

18:26.972 --> 18:28.272
No need for that.

18:30.173 --> 18:31.173
I am the commander.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.683
I'm Yang Manchun.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.521
Why are you so surprised?

18:43.889 --> 18:46.224
Is it because the commander
is standing before you,

18:47.567 --> 18:48.734
or because you're spies?

18:49.133 --> 18:49.836
Spies?

18:50.529 --> 18:51.662
Check their horses.

19:00.072 --> 19:00.872
Something's fishy.

19:01.240 --> 19:06.344
In the time of war, our soldiers
put baked beans under the saddle,

19:06.478 --> 19:07.512
as emergency ration.

19:08.580 --> 19:12.884
But these are completely empty.

19:13.318 --> 19:17.788
I heard Taizong dispatched spies
who can speak our tongue.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.158
They must be it.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.996
Die!

19:31.344 --> 19:33.437
Chu! Take one alive...

19:35.872 --> 19:36.672
Forget it.

19:37.296 --> 19:38.930
Got one alive.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.046
I'm not a spy!

19:42.981 --> 19:44.382
I'm the eldest son of the Eulbul clan.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.484
I joined the war as a cadet
and was pursued by the enemy.

19:46.552 --> 19:47.185
Eulbul clan?

19:47.886 --> 19:51.355
Didn't that clan perish
not too long ago?

19:51.423 --> 19:56.060
No, there are people who know my family.

19:56.303 --> 19:59.739
He may not be a Tang agent,
but something's off.

19:59.888 --> 20:00.569
Should I kill him?

20:02.375 --> 20:02.693
Sir?

20:07.272 --> 20:08.272
Let's bring him back.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.975
We can investigate him.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.477
If something happens,
it ain't my fault.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.682
He's still a kid.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.785
Way too big for a kid...

20:50.849 --> 20:53.718
It's Commander Yang!
Open the gate!

21:10.702 --> 21:14.605
Commander, my brother
finally mounted a horse.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.607
Already?

21:17.142 --> 21:21.512
You'll join our cavalry
unit in no time.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.882
Yeah? I really can?

21:25.150 --> 21:26.851
Just keep at it,

21:26.952 --> 21:30.554
I'll talk to the captain
and leave a spot for you.

21:33.258 --> 21:34.425
Mother!

21:36.695 --> 21:37.928
Mother!

21:38.897 --> 21:41.265
Why are you always
roaming around?

21:41.533 --> 21:43.401
I've looked everywhere...

21:45.704 --> 21:49.507
We found her during our patrol,
she was safe and sound.

21:49.741 --> 21:53.511
Thank you, Commander. Let's go.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.048
Lock him up.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.949
I'll interrogate him myself.

21:59.017 --> 22:00.851
Yes, sir! Let's go.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.527
Commander! Commander!

22:10.829 --> 22:12.930
You're needed at the market.

22:13.465 --> 22:14.031
What is it?

22:14.099 --> 22:15.933
The two lieutenants...

22:16.568 --> 22:17.368
They're at it again?

22:28.313 --> 22:29.480
Enough already!

22:34.353 --> 22:35.453
Break it off!

22:40.325 --> 22:44.161
You swordsmen are
worthless weaklings!

22:44.396 --> 22:45.996
Useless idiots!

22:52.938 --> 22:55.139
This bastard's head is made of rock!

22:55.607 --> 22:58.008
Doesn't hurt at all, asshole!

23:06.118 --> 23:08.853
Come back here!

23:15.761 --> 23:16.761
Just gonna watch?

23:17.162 --> 23:19.330
They're too worked up
to be talked down.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.741
- Let go of me.
- No way in hell.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.111
Close order formation!

23:34.646 --> 23:36.113
Close order formation!

23:49.174 --> 23:50.074
What was this about?

23:51.196 --> 23:52.730
We... Uh...

23:54.514 --> 23:56.348
Did you forget why you fought?

23:58.236 --> 24:01.138
- Why were we fighting again?
- The food, sir.

24:01.676 --> 24:04.211
Hwalbo and his men

24:04.342 --> 24:07.745
cut the meal line to
eat before others,

24:07.770 --> 24:10.338
and when I objected,
they took their shirts off

24:10.482 --> 24:12.450
and began throwing punches.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.352
What a load of shit.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.823
We're on a tight schedule,
fortifying the walls,

24:18.890 --> 24:21.492
did that bother you so much,
you heartless bastard?

24:21.560 --> 24:25.896
When your men start eating,
you leave nothing for others.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.600
You guys are more like hogs.

24:29.701 --> 24:30.901
Hogs?

24:32.037 --> 24:35.606
I should smack some sense into you!

24:35.674 --> 24:36.774
Stop it!

24:38.410 --> 24:38.843
Yes, sir.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.207
Poong!

24:41.012 --> 24:43.380
When you get angry, count to 10.

24:43.565 --> 24:43.899
Sir?

24:44.152 --> 24:45.272
Count to 10!

24:46.151 --> 24:46.884
Yes, sir.

24:47.018 --> 24:48.486
Hwalbo...

24:49.454 --> 24:52.857
always stay 5 paces away from Poong.

24:54.759 --> 24:55.559
Yes, sir.

24:56.695 --> 25:00.798
Ask the ladies to cook again,
and distribute meals fairly.

25:00.899 --> 25:03.133
Hwalbo's men, finish
fortifying the walls!

25:48.346 --> 25:49.680
Still a cadet?

25:50.715 --> 25:55.119
Vicious rumors are rampant
in the academy, how is it?

25:55.820 --> 25:57.121
I don't know what you mean.

25:57.789 --> 26:01.525
I'm asking if you were harassed
for being an Ansi man.

26:01.693 --> 26:04.061
Why would you think that?

26:11.102 --> 26:14.471
Yeon's men call me a traitor.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.642
You have a bright future and
yet instead of the capital,

26:20.011 --> 26:22.246
you're back here in a
traitor's fortress.

26:23.782 --> 26:26.350
I was pursued here by the enemy,

26:26.518 --> 26:28.786
but whether I like it or
not, Ansi is my home.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.189
With the Tang army on the
way, I can't sit back.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.830
I want to share the fate with Ansi.

26:42.133 --> 26:46.937
Share the fate? No matter what?

26:47.706 --> 26:49.006
That's right.

26:57.649 --> 26:58.515
Samul!

26:59.985 --> 27:01.151
You're home!

27:01.519 --> 27:02.353
Master!

27:03.488 --> 27:04.488
Samul...

27:08.159 --> 27:12.696
He's the last remaining
member of the Eulbul clan.

27:13.164 --> 27:16.700
They're like brothers with my clan,

27:17.902 --> 27:23.841
but everyone died in battle,
and only he and I remain.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.611
These men are my brothers-in-arms.

27:27.979 --> 27:31.348
This is my right hand
man, Chu, you met him.

27:36.988 --> 27:37.888
Chu, go on.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.658
Treat him with respect.

27:41.893 --> 27:43.060
You said he's still a kid.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.466
He's still an officer,
he'll lead you in time.

27:50.035 --> 27:53.704
I'm Chu, pardon me for earlier.

27:53.772 --> 27:56.640
I'm Poong, I lead the swordsmen.

27:57.275 --> 27:58.842
I'm axe unit's Hwalbo.

27:58.977 --> 28:02.413
I demolish my enemies in half.

28:03.081 --> 28:06.383
Everything gets
demolished in his mouth.

28:06.981 --> 28:09.783
I've had it with you.

28:11.732 --> 28:12.356
Yeah?

28:13.391 --> 28:16.493
Another smack in the head
will set you straight.

28:16.518 --> 28:17.051
Poong!

28:18.697 --> 28:19.329
Hwalbo.

28:20.141 --> 28:20.707
Yes?

28:20.732 --> 28:23.067
I ordered you to stay
5 paces away.

28:23.134 --> 28:23.801
Yes, sir.

28:26.571 --> 28:29.440
Samul, do you really wish
to share the fate with Ansi?

28:29.941 --> 28:30.641
Yes, Commander.

28:32.310 --> 28:34.745
Then grab my flag and stand by my side.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.313
The flag, sir?

28:36.781 --> 28:37.681
Commander...

28:43.221 --> 28:47.057
Fight alongside with us
as a citizen of Ansi.

28:48.093 --> 28:52.930
The flag notifies my position
during battle at all times.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.534
Samul, thank him at once!

29:01.873 --> 29:03.340
Thank you, Commander.

29:48.219 --> 29:52.523
Commander! Please, this way, sir.

29:55.593 --> 29:59.062
What is all this? You brought
us precious alcohol.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.532
Even meat.

30:05.436 --> 30:09.740
I don't know how to thank you
for coming to our shabby home.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.443
A baby was born in Ansi,
how could I not come?

30:16.414 --> 30:18.949
Have you given him a name yet?

30:22.987 --> 30:24.621
What? Nothing yet?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.323
We have a name.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.559
I tried to change his mind,

30:29.194 --> 30:31.695
but he said it had to be
the one he chose.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.564
Alright, what's the name?

30:34.432 --> 30:36.433
It's Neut-bom.

30:37.435 --> 30:40.204
Will you allow us to use that name?

30:41.773 --> 30:42.940
In Chinese characters,

30:44.242 --> 30:46.677
- that's my name, no?
- Yes, sir.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.822
One, two!

30:59.190 --> 31:01.358
One, two!

31:01.559 --> 31:15.305
One, two!

31:24.849 --> 31:26.483
What are you looking at?

31:28.386 --> 31:30.487
What kind of a man is the commander?

31:31.789 --> 31:33.423
Commander Yang?

31:35.260 --> 31:35.926
Yes.

31:37.862 --> 31:42.699
What does he mean to the Ansi people?

31:44.569 --> 31:46.203
Enough! Stop!

31:47.205 --> 31:53.343
We all think of him as
Ansi Fortress itself.

31:54.913 --> 31:59.349
Ansi without him isn't Ansi.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.453
Good, you're up.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.660
Why isn't Paso around?

32:10.261 --> 32:10.994
Well...

32:13.264 --> 32:17.901
He must still be sleeping after
returning from late patrol.

32:25.977 --> 32:26.910
Damn it.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.518
Morning, sir.

32:40.591 --> 32:41.858
Looking for something?

32:44.929 --> 32:45.829
Come out.

32:46.447 --> 32:47.127
Out!

32:49.200 --> 32:50.100
There's no one...

32:55.473 --> 32:57.507
- How did Beckha get here...?
- Brother...

33:02.580 --> 33:03.814
Commander, what are you...

33:03.948 --> 33:05.849
Wait, please! Stop!

33:05.950 --> 33:07.884
Please! Wait a minute!

33:08.853 --> 33:09.820
He really shot me!

33:09.887 --> 33:10.287
Manchun!

33:10.355 --> 33:12.556
Sir, please calm down!

33:12.657 --> 33:15.392
It's me the cavalry unit captain,
will you really kill me?

33:15.526 --> 33:17.260
You think I can't?

33:19.530 --> 33:21.932
Come on!

33:22.033 --> 33:22.866
Manchun!

33:24.268 --> 33:26.370
Chu, please calm him down.

33:27.238 --> 33:28.572
He doesn't listen to me lately.

33:28.973 --> 33:31.441
- Jeez...
- Chu, help!

33:32.767 --> 33:36.513
Don't even lay a finger on him.

33:36.581 --> 33:39.783
Move aside, I'll just
put some arrows in him.

33:39.884 --> 33:43.320
Shoot me first, I came to him.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.523
I told you to wait
until end of the war.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.660
What if one of you dies?
What will you do then?

33:54.565 --> 33:55.966
That's for us to worry about.

34:04.601 --> 34:05.315
Sir.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.318
Good job, Beckha.

34:17.321 --> 34:19.089
So you're Samul?

34:19.424 --> 34:20.690
I'm also from the academy.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.038
I don't see any other men.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.076
It's a recon unit.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.178
They came to scout the fortress.

34:41.478 --> 34:45.649
If they're here, Taizong isn't too far.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.686
He arrived quicker than I thought.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.657
He's in a rush to take the capital.

35:02.967 --> 35:03.867
Get ready!

35:05.136 --> 35:06.770
The Tang Emperor will arrive soon!

35:07.772 --> 35:08.572
Yes, sir!

35:11.676 --> 35:14.811
- Stand closer!
- Yes, sir!

35:14.912 --> 35:17.781
Don't let anyone crawl up these walls!

35:17.849 --> 35:19.616
- Got that?!
- Yes, sir!

35:19.717 --> 35:21.485
Shoulder-to-shoulder!

35:21.552 --> 35:24.653
- Kill them at once!
- Yes, sir!

35:39.737 --> 35:42.606
Samul, show me your dagger.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.224
It's a good one.

36:02.982 --> 36:05.216
Trim my beard with it.

36:05.504 --> 36:05.867
Sir?

36:07.765 --> 36:10.967
A man's beard must be
trimmed before the war.

36:13.104 --> 36:15.605
Go on, trim it.

36:56.647 --> 36:57.681
Now is not the time.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.424
You'll have plenty of chances.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.593
But not right now.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.467
We're ready, Commander.

37:21.872 --> 37:24.574
He's holding a dagger, are you okay?

37:24.809 --> 37:25.609
It's fine.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.478
Didn't I tell you he felt fishy?

37:29.680 --> 37:30.847
Yeon sent him, right?

37:35.519 --> 37:36.486
He must be eliminated.

37:37.455 --> 37:39.422
What if he backstabs us during battle?

37:40.558 --> 37:41.758
He's still an Ansi man.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.194
We'll find out soon.

37:47.932 --> 37:51.801
I'll kill him at the first sight
of something weird.

37:56.858 --> 37:57.697
Main army?

37:59.277 --> 38:00.277
I believe so.

38:09.186 --> 38:09.853
Samul!

38:11.622 --> 38:12.922
Take the flag!

38:14.725 --> 38:15.759
Yes, sir.

41:16.841 --> 41:19.976
They sure brought a big army
to a small fortress.

41:20.744 --> 41:22.679
How many men do you think that is?

41:22.780 --> 41:26.382
You were briefed, it's
200,000, get with it.

41:27.151 --> 41:31.721
We got 5,000 men,
it'll be a lopsided battle.

41:35.926 --> 41:37.594
I anticipated this, but
to see it first hand,

41:39.763 --> 41:40.830
it's overwhelming.

41:45.269 --> 41:46.469
Will you really fight?

42:14.431 --> 42:17.400
When people heard about the
Tang army heading here,

42:19.703 --> 42:21.104
they all asked me,

42:23.307 --> 42:24.941
"What will you do?"

42:28.178 --> 42:31.114
I told them I'd fight.

42:32.316 --> 42:33.216
What can I do?

42:35.152 --> 42:37.287
I never learned to retreat.

42:39.023 --> 42:41.190
I never learned to kneel!

42:41.759 --> 42:43.493
And I never learned to surrender!

42:44.395 --> 42:45.495
I learned

42:46.597 --> 42:48.464
that you must fight when you have to!

42:50.401 --> 42:53.469
When someone attempts to
destroy something you cherish,

42:54.538 --> 42:56.105
you must risk your life!

42:57.641 --> 42:59.142
Now is that moment!

43:00.578 --> 43:01.978
Look behind you!

43:06.884 --> 43:08.117
The people of Ansi!

43:17.561 --> 43:20.763
They are the ones we cherish!

43:22.800 --> 43:24.867
Let's fight to protect them!

43:28.606 --> 43:30.840
To battle!

43:31.308 --> 43:33.810
To battle!

43:36.180 --> 43:38.047
To battle!

43:38.315 --> 43:40.049
To battle!

44:04.742 --> 44:06.776
Is he the commander of Ansi Fortress?

44:07.478 --> 44:09.646
Yes, Your Majesty.

44:12.975 --> 44:14.242
He has heart.

44:16.887 --> 44:18.888
But it's futile.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.391
Indeed, Your Majesty.

44:21.692 --> 44:24.527
No fortress has stood still
once you laid your eyes on it.

44:37.735 --> 44:40.906
I grant pillaging of Ansi Fortress!

44:41.308 --> 44:42.808
Everything inside is yours to take!

44:43.219 --> 44:45.117
Take their properties!

44:45.606 --> 44:48.985
Make their children your slaves!

44:52.238 --> 44:54.738
And rape every woman in sight!

44:58.399 --> 45:00.843
Siege the fortress!

45:20.851 --> 45:22.518
This is insanity...

45:31.380 --> 45:32.069
Begin.

45:32.579 --> 45:34.065
Begin!

45:38.802 --> 45:39.802
Trebuchet!

45:40.104 --> 45:41.637
Trebuchet!

46:21.078 --> 46:23.813
Fire at will!

46:36.059 --> 46:37.827
Quite intense.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.097
Reload!

46:42.399 --> 46:43.533
Fire!

46:48.472 --> 46:50.006
Incoming!

47:04.021 --> 47:05.555
Take cover!

47:06.223 --> 47:07.423
The rock's huge!

47:07.658 --> 47:09.158
It's so big!

47:09.259 --> 47:10.526
That'll kill you!

47:10.761 --> 47:12.094
Get down!

47:24.441 --> 47:26.008
Look out!

47:32.516 --> 47:33.549
Very good!

47:47.764 --> 47:49.232
Why won't the walls fall?

47:50.901 --> 47:57.840
The walls seem to be filled with dirt.

47:58.275 --> 48:03.112
Structural integrity remains because of it.

48:13.423 --> 48:16.359
Then climb the walls.

48:16.712 --> 48:20.052
Advance!

48:20.086 --> 48:21.084
Forward!

48:29.973 --> 48:30.973
Battle station!

48:37.014 --> 48:39.048
- Fire!
- Fire!

48:47.724 --> 48:48.824
Shields up!

48:50.093 --> 48:53.429
Archers! Fire!

48:59.770 --> 49:01.938
Kill anyone who retreats!

49:02.306 --> 49:03.472
Advance!

49:05.475 --> 49:06.509
Go!

49:19.289 --> 49:21.490
Go! Climb the walls!

49:50.721 --> 49:52.455
Climb the walls!

49:53.156 --> 49:54.557
Keep going!

49:56.927 --> 49:57.727
Repel them!

50:03.600 --> 50:05.034
Don't stop!

50:33.363 --> 50:35.898
Deploy Wolf Teeth Striker!
And Malevolent Wood!

50:35.966 --> 50:38.100
Wolf Teeth Striker!

50:38.769 --> 50:40.536
Malevolent Wood!

51:12.702 --> 51:13.969
Push!

51:42.899 --> 51:45.534
Paso, shouldn’t we help them?

51:46.236 --> 51:48.270
We wait for the commander's order.

51:53.443 --> 51:54.844
Lady Beckha, what do we do?

51:55.745 --> 51:58.347
Don't worry, trust the commander.

52:16.199 --> 52:17.967
Maintain your position!

53:26.970 --> 53:28.404
It went in too deep.

53:33.640 --> 53:34.082
What?

53:34.945 --> 53:36.312
I came within 5 paces.

53:37.581 --> 53:38.414
Dammit!

53:39.716 --> 53:42.184
That idiot's too barbaric.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.097
Break down the gate!

54:10.780 --> 54:13.682
Asanasi, take the left flank!

54:13.883 --> 54:15.451
Kill them all!

54:15.785 --> 54:20.522
Forward! Kill them!

54:22.559 --> 54:24.326
Keep going!

54:24.828 --> 54:27.496
Royal guards take the right flank!

54:27.697 --> 54:29.398
Forward!

54:29.899 --> 54:31.867
Attack!

54:34.304 --> 54:35.137
Pull the rope!

55:01.551 --> 55:03.479
- Beckha!
- Beckha!

55:04.296 --> 55:05.077
Let's go!

55:08.738 --> 55:10.973
- Paso!
- Paso!

55:54.784 --> 55:55.384
Push!

56:09.632 --> 56:14.703
Your majesty, the gate will fall soon!

56:15.605 --> 56:16.905
Good!

56:24.247 --> 56:25.814
Kill them all!

56:31.521 --> 56:33.122
We have been breached.

56:33.923 --> 56:35.524
They won't get inside.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.031
Close order formation!

57:16.139 --> 57:17.406
Close order formation!

57:18.195 --> 57:19.312
Close order formation!

57:21.905 --> 57:23.038
Close order formation!

57:23.973 --> 57:25.174
Close order formation!

57:29.646 --> 57:31.413
Push!

58:12.956 --> 58:15.858
Ballista! Deploy!

59:10.847 --> 59:12.080
Order our retreat.

59:27.030 --> 59:28.664
Victory!

59:54.090 --> 59:55.023
How...

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.361
Get some rest.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.596
You must be tired too.

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:39.267
You knew I'd harm you,
why did you let me be?

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:43.138
What's the point of killing you?

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:45.974
He'll send another.

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:57.052
Some battle scars, but
many are from his spies.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.692
Do you really think you'll win?

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.363
Tang's assault won't end here.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.766
They'll attack with even more might,

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.768
will you continue to fight?

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.103
Samul

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:20.776
Do you only fight winnable battles?

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:35.724
Eat plenty and regain your strength.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:40.529
Eat slowly, you barbarian.

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:44.399
Stay back, asshole.

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:47.302
Look at that!

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.071
What the hell is that?

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.846
Eat up. You'll need the strength.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.528
Did you eat?

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:05.180
<i>You traitor! Are you going to defy me?!</i>

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:22.430
They continue to hide behind smoke.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.267
What are they planning?

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.283
Why did you defy General Yeon?

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.889
He killed our king.

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:27.662
The king was under Taizong's influence
and released Tang prisoners.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:32.767
Taizong was able to invade
thanks to those men.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.303
That's why Yeon killed the king!

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.940
It also gave Taizong
a reason to go to war.

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.310
This war should not have happened.

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.246
But it did.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:47.515
And you...

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.686
you refused Yeon's order
to send reinforcement,

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:56.157
and let our men die on the battlefield.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:01.930
You saw what happened
on that field.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:07.769
Fighting the Tang army
in an open field is suicide.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.773
Had I sent reinforcement,
they'd all have perished!

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:15.477
And this fortress would
have been in ashes.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:21.716
You sound like a coward
who hid from a battle!

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:29.491
Yang Manchun, you traitor,
Ansi and you will fall.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:32.327
Tell me you'll obey General Yeon!

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:39.401
Answer me, now!

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.808
Following someone's
order isn't important.

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.312
As the commander,

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:54.516
I must protect this fortress.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:07.896
What the hell?

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:20.575
Commander!

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.478
How dare you?!

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.481
I won't let this slide!

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:27.849
Taizong comes first.

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:49.637
Fire!

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:53.508
Hurry, put it out!

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.205
Hurry!

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.108
Keep advancing!

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:56.204
Did the God of Goguryeo show you that?

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.173
Look closely.

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:02.977
Yang and Ansi will fall tonight.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.892
Do not fall back!

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.238
Push them back! Fight!

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:37.912
The siege towers...

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.188
We're finished at this rate.

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.091
We must destroy those towers!

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:33.868
Commander!

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.746
- Gather oil pouches!
- Yes, sir!

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.948
Ready the oil pouches!

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.121
Oil pouches are ready, sir!

01:11:05.453 --> 01:11:06.492
Throw!

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:12.567
- Commander!
- How are you feeling, brother?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.269
The Commander is awake!

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.283
How long was I out?

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:30.651
4 days, sir.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.688
The Tang army?

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:36.023
Taizong retreated to the rear.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.193
He won't attack recklessly.

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:50.805
So you saved me.

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:53.007
Yes, sir.

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:57.979
You could've died
if it wasn't for Samul.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:48.095
I've conquered this vast land,

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:52.733
thousands of kilometres
in all directions,

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:59.807
but why I can't destroy a tiny fortress?

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:15.756
I'll make sure they don't
look down on my army.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:20.261
Your Majesty, what will you do?

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:24.532
Bring me the Goguryeo medium.

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.805
No! You cannot do this!

01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:36.777
You've foreseen Ansi's doom!

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:53.427
Who's there? Stop at once!

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.686
It's Holy King Jumong's bow.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.324
How did you get here?

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:28.929
Emperor Taizong sent me.

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:37.938
He's giving you an option
before his final move.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.007
Final move?

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:47.815
He'll build a dirt mound
higher than Ansi and attack.

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.286
A dirt mound?

01:19:55.657 --> 01:20:00.494
He said you won't be
able to defend his attack.

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.677
Push!

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.613
Harder!

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.854
Hurry up! Keep shoveling!

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.899
Hurry!

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:01.856
They really are building a mountain.

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:07.027
Crazy bastards, that's no joke.

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.330
What do we do now?

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:13.367
They will go all out.

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:29.884
This battle brought us together again.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.061
Manchun.

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.799
I came here to save you.

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:54.008
Taizong made me see
the vision of Ansi's future.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:22:01.115
Ansi will ultimately fall.

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:08.923
His men will attack from a higher
ground with arrows like rain,

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:15.329
and bodies of your men
will create a new mountain.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.534
I've heard enough.

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:22.269
You must surrender.

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.105
The emperor promised me,

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:30.744
if you surrender, he'll
offer you anything.

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:37.451
Once the dirt mound
is complete, it's all over.

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.690
What I want is...

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:48.662
to defend Ansi just
as we have thus far.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.352
Status report.

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:16.056
The progress is faster than anticipated.

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:18.826
We're projected to finish in 2 months.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.662
Complete it before the winter arrives.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.797
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:30.437
Move faster! Hurry!

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.445
We must request reinforcement
from the capital.

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:42.216
Reinforcement? Yeon
thinks we're traitors.

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:43.851
He won't send any.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:47.988
Just saying you're from Ansi
will get your throat cut.

01:23:48.289 --> 01:23:50.057
We're left without options.

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.828
If you allow me, I shall go, Commander.

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:56.964
Samul.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:24:03.470
I feel you, but Yeon has
never changed his mind.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.006
There is one last option.

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.777
Strike Taizong directly.

01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:16.050
We can strike while they're
focused on the construction.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.952
Their security is shabby at best.

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:25.859
His golden tent is
distinguishable even at night.

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:27.928
Who'd do that?

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:31.031
The fastest unit here, my cavalry.

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.400
I can't send you to a death trap.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:38.906
Sir, I've consulted my
men for a long time.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.475
I'll get this done.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:46.246
When the mound is done, so are we.

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:53.287
You also know that this
is the last option.

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:00.928
Give me the order.

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.973
Walking into Tang's HQ is suicide!

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:20.547
Whether he succeeds or
not, he won't return.

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:27.721
I know that. I don't want this either.

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:35.162
But I can't deny that
this is the only way.

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:03.090
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

01:26:08.567 --> 01:26:09.950
I will return.

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:39.660
Promise me that you will.

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:46.533
Yes, I'll be back
before sunrise, Beckha.

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:52.606
I won't go to sleep until you do so.

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:41.288
Who's there?

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:21.061
We're surrounded...

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:26.066
It's a trap, the ambush was detected.

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:33.940
We have a mole.

01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:36.843
Take cover!

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:51.491
Did we fail?

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.277
Commander, it's Paso!

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:17.184
Paso! Paso!

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:21.688
It was... a trap...

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.990
Mole, there's a mole...

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.161
Paso! Snap out of it! Stay awake!

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.300
Listen to me!

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:38.605
Please... tell Beckha...

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:45.312
Tell her... not to wait up...

01:29:45.808 --> 01:29:46.268
I...

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:03.563
Paso! No!

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.233
Paso!

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:07.734
Please...

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:08.902
Paso...

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:31.691
Paso...

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.175
Holy medium...

01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:51.411
Paso's soul must still be nearby.

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:57.551
Please, please make his
soul return to his body!

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:58.852
Please...

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:03.590
Please save Paso...

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:07.093
I can't save him...

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.899
Because I'm the one
who led to his death!

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:25.011
I alerted them.

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:30.817
I sent them a message on
an arrow about the ambush!

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:35.822
But why?

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:38.325
I'm sorry, Beckha...

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.595
I just wanted to save this fortress...

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:47.467
We won't even get a chance
to surrender later.

01:31:55.576 --> 01:31:59.513
Paso, sweetheart...

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:07.621
Sir, the medium killed Paso.

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:11.892
We cannot forgive her.

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:13.827
We have to kill her.

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.531
Did you really do this?

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:24.371
Our gods have abandoned
us, they cannot save us.

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.974
Come with me to the emperor.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:30.577
Then we can all live!

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:31.978
Stop it.

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:38.552
Defeat is inevitable,
that's the god's will!

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:39.553
Stop!

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:48.495
If you can deny me, kill me now.

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:58.905
Please, do not lead us to our deaths!

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:22.829
Ansi will not fall.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.395
Have you truly forsaken us?

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:00.033
We have a situation!

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:04.070
It's Lady Beckha, she's
headed for Taizong!

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.177
Stop her!

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:14.080
Take her down!

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:19.953
Die!

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:40.907
Stop her!

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:08.034
Just one girl?

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:11.571
Is it bravery or stupidity?

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:30.857
Protect the emperor!

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:25.345
Impressive.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:29.649
Return her body.

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.513
Do not bury them like the others,

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.186
float them down the river.

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:21.227
They'll meet again in the west sea.

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:02.035
Halt!

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:07.674
He's a Goguryeo soldier! Seize him!

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:10.410
Get him!

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:14.847
Stop!

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:02.895
The fortress will be
under my feet soon.

01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:17.844
What's the progress on
the dirt mound?

01:40:18.645 --> 01:40:24.817
It'll be completed in
about 10 days or so.

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:30.990
I saw my dead men in my dream.

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:36.095
Paso and Beckha were there as well.

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:39.432
And Samul, too...

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:44.070
Could he be dead?

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.275
Commander.

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:52.779
Do not think of the dead and
look at those who are alive!

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.114
They're all depending on you!

01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:57.683
They got here by trusting you!

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:03.990
You cannot show them your weak side.

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:10.830
<i>The Capital</i>

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:15.134
Send reinforcement to Ansi?

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.103
Yes, General.

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:21.774
Ansi commander and his men
are fighting with their lives.

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:24.610
They have fought valiantly!

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:31.384
But once the mound is complete,
Ansi will be in danger.

01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:33.219
Reinforce the traitor?

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:34.787
Maybe this is for the better.

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:38.024
He'll vanish with the mound.

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:40.326
He's not a traitor!

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:45.731
Then what is he?

01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:59.779
I asked you a question.

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:07.520
He's just another Goguryeo man.

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:10.656
You call the traitor a Goguryeo man?

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:15.661
Will you also defy me?

01:42:15.929 --> 01:42:18.197
Of course not, I simply...

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:24.403
I didn't send you to Ansi
to hear these words!

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:27.273
He may not follow your orders,

01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:30.510
but he's risking his life
to fight the Tang army.

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:33.112
Why do you think he fights?

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:36.215
Because he is a citizen
of this country!

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:41.120
Despite being labeled a traitor,
people of Ansi fight with him.

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:46.492
They fight because they
all belong to Goguryeo!

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:50.730
How could you shun them?!

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:54.400
Please help Ansi.

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.235
Please save them...

01:42:57.237 --> 01:43:00.239
They are all Goguryeo people!

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.763
You put the dirt under
the sand, like this.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:27.700
If you put your hand like
this, it makes a tunnel.

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:32.805
Oh no, it collapsed.

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:42.848
<i>Topple the mound?</i>

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:47.220
The soil in this area
has a lot of pebbles.

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:53.059
It doesn't mix well with other types,

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.094
and is susceptible to shock.

01:43:55.529 --> 01:44:01.634
So if we dig under the
mound, it can be toppled?

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:06.439
Right, since it's incredibly heavy,
it'll fall easily if we build a cave,

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:09.775
and knock over all columns at once.

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:15.481
But digging a cave won't be easy.

01:44:16.187 --> 01:44:17.497
Can you do it in time?

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:22.388
Ansi region has a lot of iron.

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:27.927
That's why there are
so many miners here.

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.263
There's another problem.

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:34.600
The mound's steep side
is pointing at us,

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.936
so it'll tip over towards us,

01:44:37.204 --> 01:44:39.639
which will make them easier
to breach our walls.

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:43.075
We must take over
the mound at the right time.

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:49.282
I trust you, Woo-dae.

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:53.552
It will be done.

01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:13.272
Keep it up! We're almost done!

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:16.575
Come on! Hurry!

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:06.258
What a magnificent view.

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:13.199
Prepare a feast for our men.

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:16.569
Ansi will fall by tomorrow!

01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:18.404
Yes, Your Majesty!

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:28.681
Commander!

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.817
- How it goes?
- Well...

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.619
We're almost done.

01:46:45.899 --> 01:46:47.767
Can we really topple it?

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:50.269
We have to leave the rest to god.

01:46:51.605 --> 01:46:53.606
You heard that crazy woman.

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.941
Our gods have abandoned us, you idiot.

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:58.444
Don't jinx it, asshole.

01:47:01.615 --> 01:47:06.852
No matter what happens
tomorrow, don't die before me.

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:12.992
If you plan on dying, count
to 10 before you do.

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:16.996
You fool...

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:20.900
Even if you reach the afterlife,

01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:27.773
arrive 5 paces after me, asshole.

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:06.812
It'll fill up with water
before we can knock it down.

01:48:43.517 --> 01:48:44.783
Burn the columns!

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:47.319
- Apply plenty of oil!
- Yes, sir!

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:58.063
Commander! Commander!

01:48:58.431 --> 01:49:00.733
The columns are too wet to be burned.

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:02.134
What do we do now?

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:08.574
We can chop them down with our axes.

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:12.411
But you won't be able to escape.

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:17.316
If the mound is not toppled,
we're all dead anyway.

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:21.554
We dug it up, we'll finish it.

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:23.589
Woo-dae, step aside.

01:49:24.024 --> 01:49:27.192
Chopping is my specialty,
my men and I will do it.

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:30.663
You all have to fight the Tang army.

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.932
This is our work.

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:35.267
So we'll take...

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.476
Mother! Why are you here?

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:57.089
Mother, don't ever take the cart
outside the fortress alone, okay?

01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:07.099
And don't skip your meals.

01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:16.084
Sir.

01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:21.347
Please take care of my mother.

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:27.286
And defend this fortress at all costs.

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:33.225
Woo-dae...

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:40.132
Godspeed.

01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:43.425
Let's go!

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:54.980
Begin!

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.529
Lower the bridge.

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:13.532
Lower the bridge!

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:19.972
We have to hurry.

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:21.940
They'll be here soon.

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:23.976
Let's move.

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:44.997
Harder!

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:09.321
Almost there! Chop harder!

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:14.393
Attack!

01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:15.994
Forward!

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:39.017
Good work everyone...

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.529
The mound is falling!

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:54.600
Look out!

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.114
It's falling!

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:41.180
Fall back!

01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:45.484
Fall back!

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:51.356
The dirt mound...

01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:55.994
What is happening?

01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:00.199
Now! Take over the mound!

01:54:00.966 --> 01:54:02.085
Let's go!

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:21.013
We lost the dirt mound.

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:28.020
Defense formation.

01:55:28.788 --> 01:55:29.821
Yes, sir!

01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.024
Defense formation!

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:36.762
Fufuai.

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:40.299
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:44.469
What were you doing while
they took the mound?

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:48.173
Your Majesty...

01:55:57.850 --> 01:56:03.555
Emperor, we must turn
the army around.

01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:06.892
It's been 3 months since
we arrived in Goguryeo.

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:13.865
If their reinforcement arrives from the
capital, we'll be left with little options.

01:56:14.233 --> 01:56:16.068
I will not turn back like this.

01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:20.272
Even if I can't have Goguryeo,

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:28.947
I want Yang's head on a plate!

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:30.882
Emperor...

01:56:31.784 --> 01:56:33.452
Take back the mound.

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:42.394
I will not stop until it's ours again!

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:46.365
Continue to assault nonstop.

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:49.368
This is our final moment.

01:56:51.237 --> 01:56:55.073
Everything will be decided here.

01:56:56.809 --> 01:57:02.514
Ansi's fate depends on
how we hold our ground.

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:08.687
Give all you've got for Ansi.

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:19.431
Assault! Go!

01:57:21.367 --> 01:57:22.868
Attack!

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.771
Take over the mound!

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:28.070
Fire!

01:57:34.085 --> 01:57:35.047
Fire!

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:45.590
Light it!

01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:50.391
Roll!

01:57:55.811 --> 01:57:56.743
Roll!

01:58:35.108 --> 01:58:35.941
Attack!

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.843
Keep attacking!

01:59:00.566 --> 01:59:03.068
Don't stop! Roll!

02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:02.827
Continue advancing!

02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:05.197
Forward!

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:26.718
Commander!

02:00:27.353 --> 02:00:28.954
We're almost out of arrows!

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:48.240
Keep going! Continue attacking!

02:00:49.942 --> 02:00:53.678
- Soldier, bring me the holy bow.
- The bow?

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:57.115
Go to my barrack, you'll see a large bow.

02:00:58.117 --> 02:00:58.883
Yes, Commander!

02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:07.892
No more arrows?

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:19.871
Your Majesty.

02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:22.474
They've stopped attacking
with wheels and arrows!

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:26.578
Good, they've run out of ammo!

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:30.882
Royal guards, get to the frontline!

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:38.423
Commander!

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.760
There's no way to defend it.

02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:44.929
We've done all we can.

02:01:46.799 --> 02:01:49.067
- Commander.
- Sir.

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:50.802
Commander!

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:54.406
I've brought the holy bow.

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:57.108
What will you do with it?

02:01:57.576 --> 02:01:58.576
I'll get the emperor.

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:00.512
But he's out of range.

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:04.182
This is a long-range bow.

02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:06.384
But no one can wield this bow.

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:10.221
Only Holy King Jumong
was able to use it.

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.092
If he hasn't forsaken us,

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:20.131
Jumong will pull the bow with me.

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:27.105
Protect our Commander,
fight till the end!

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:30.809
We will never surrender.

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:35.480
He's right, it's not
over until it's over.

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:52.764
Go! Attack!

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:56.701
Take back the mound!

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:56.688
<i>Gods of Goguryeo, help us.</i>

02:04:58.824 --> 02:04:59.924
<i>With your help,</i>

02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:08.132
<i>we will end this war...</i>

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:14.672
<i>Fly this arrow...</i>

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:37.850
Your Majesty!

02:07:00.613 --> 02:07:03.715
It's the Goguryeo army!
Their reinforcement!

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:20.632
Your Majesty!

02:07:28.774 --> 02:07:30.475
Fall back...

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:42.718
I've... I've lost...

02:07:52.431 --> 02:07:54.465
Our reinforcement is here!

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:28.232
Sir!

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:30.601
It's Samul!

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:02.900
Commander

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:49.147
<i>3 years after returning home,</i>

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:52.717
<i>Emperor Taizong succumbed
to his battle wounds and died.</i>

02:09:53.519 --> 02:09:58.589
<i>He told others to never
invade Goguryeo again.</i>

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:20.611
Going back to the capital?

02:10:21.611 --> 02:10:24.515
I haven't finished my training.

02:10:30.158 --> 02:10:30.785
Commander.

02:10:34.352 --> 02:10:35.233
Thank you.

02:10:38.263 --> 02:10:39.864
For protecting Ansi.

02:10:41.466 --> 02:10:46.037
And for protecting this country.

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:52.176
We did it together.

02:10:56.648 --> 02:10:58.015
Come back any time.
