WEBVTT

00:05.369 --> 00:07.883
Thank you, everybody, for being here.
Have a great evening,

00:08.048 --> 00:10.961
- and drive safe.
- Oh, I cannot believe this heat wave.

00:11.129 --> 00:14.280
It's 2 a.m. How can it be so hot
when there's no sun?

00:14.449 --> 00:16.280
Tell me about it.
The Cranberries are playing

00:16.449 --> 00:18.280
an animal-rights benefit here
on Saturday,

00:18.449 --> 00:20.519
and it's gonna be
a million degrees in here.

00:22.329 --> 00:25.844
Phoebe, you keep making
like you're on Red Shoe Diaries,

00:26.009 --> 00:28.239
and I'm gonna have to bust out
a can of man repellent.

00:28.409 --> 00:30.639
- I can't help it.
- All right, people,

00:30.809 --> 00:33.881
move along. Nothing to see here.
Go on.

00:34.449 --> 00:37.282
Goodness.
Am I gonna have to hose you down?

00:37.449 --> 00:41.647
It's not my fault.
I am in a highly excited state right now.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.879
Not that I'd mind
being hosed down with water.

00:44.049 --> 00:46.404
I feel like I'm on fire.
Feel my forehead.

00:46.609 --> 00:49.601
- Phoebe, you're burning up.
- I know, tell me about it.

00:49.769 --> 00:52.602
Something's happening to me, Piper,
something really freaky.

00:52.769 --> 00:55.488
Sweetie, I think
you need to call a doctor.

00:55.649 --> 00:59.688
But I don't feel sick. I just... I feel...

01:01.369 --> 01:04.327
I feel hot, aroused.

01:09.249 --> 01:10.967
I've been having this dream, Piper.

01:11.409 --> 01:13.923
This sex dream.

01:14.089 --> 01:17.525
It's not like I haven't dreamt about sex
before, because I have, you know.

01:17.689 --> 01:19.759
But this is... This is different.

01:19.929 --> 01:26.038
This feels real swank penthouse
love den, candles, satin sheets...

01:26.209 --> 01:27.608
Okey-dokey, I get the point.

01:27.769 --> 01:33.082
But every night it's with a different
man telling me that I'm irresistible.

01:33.249 --> 01:34.967
And then we...

01:35.369 --> 01:38.839
Well, let's just say
we could win the gold medal

01:39.009 --> 01:41.398
- in the Hugh Hefner Olympics.
- And this is a bad thing?

01:41.569 --> 01:45.448
No, it's a good thing.
It's a very good thing until I kill them.

01:45.609 --> 01:47.361
That's how your dream ends?
You kill the guy?

01:47.529 --> 01:52.557
Each and every night, Piper.
I told you, something is wrong with me.

01:52.729 --> 01:56.085
There is nothing wrong with you.
It's a dream, a metaphor

01:56.369 --> 01:58.280
for extreme sexual frustration.

01:58.849 --> 02:00.840
Trust me, I should know.

02:01.129 --> 02:04.599
- Oh, good, we're decoding men.
- Prue, what are you doing here?

02:04.769 --> 02:07.681
I'll tell you what I'm not doing.
I am not lighting candles,

02:07.849 --> 02:10.806
I'm not getting a back rub, and I'm
not running a hot bubble bath for two.

02:10.969 --> 02:12.721
Things didn't go well with Alan?

02:12.889 --> 02:14.800
Well, see, that's the thing,
I'm not really sure.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.482
I mean, third date, a hot night,

02:16.649 --> 02:20.358
romantic dinner, and he drops me off
with barely even a kiss good night.

02:20.529 --> 02:21.518
I'm a little confused.

02:21.689 --> 02:24.362
Well, that's not necessarily
an official rejection.

02:24.529 --> 02:27.566
I mean, when they say, "I'll call you,"
that's the kiss of death.

02:27.769 --> 02:29.361
- Maybe he just got nervous.
- Yeah,

02:29.529 --> 02:31.167
or maybe he's just not interested.

02:31.329 --> 02:34.639
I mean, I gave out all the signals
for him to move forward,

02:34.809 --> 02:37.243
and he ran away. Men don't just
run away when you give them

02:37.409 --> 02:39.047
all the signals, right?
So, what gives?

02:39.209 --> 02:42.007
Okay, that's enough talk
about men for me.

02:42.169 --> 02:44.603
I need to go home
and take a long cold shower

02:44.769 --> 02:46.600
and have a good night's sleep, I hope.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.518
Sweet dreams. Don't kill anyone.

02:51.089 --> 02:52.602
Don't ask.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.729 --> 03:06.959
I can't believe we're doing this.

03:07.289 --> 03:10.884
You've gotta be the most beautiful
woman I've ever laid eyes on.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.639
Either I'm dreaming,
or I'm falling in love.

03:20.969 --> 03:24.803
Oh, man, I am definitely
falling in love.

03:26.689 --> 03:29.681
Where have you been my entire life?

03:31.049 --> 03:32.562
You are irresistible.

05:23.449 --> 05:27.044
- Alan, hi.
- Hi. Man, it's hot, huh?

05:27.289 --> 05:30.838
- Bad day for the a.c. To be on the fritz.
- Yeah, bad day. Listen, Alan...

05:31.089 --> 05:33.284
Hey, Davis, can you hold the elevator,
please? Thanks.

05:33.449 --> 05:35.041
Sorry, I'm late for a meeting.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.645
Okay, Alan, just out of curiosity,
did something happen

05:38.809 --> 05:41.562
on our date last night
to upset you or something?

05:42.089 --> 05:45.001
Upset? No, no, not at all.

05:45.169 --> 05:48.206
Actually, I had a great time.
We should do it again.

05:48.409 --> 05:50.161
I'll call you.

05:53.929 --> 05:55.328
The kiss of death.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.128
Speaking of deadly kisses,
I need to speak to you, Prue.

05:58.329 --> 06:02.447
- Yeah, sure, Darryl.
- Everything okay?

06:02.809 --> 06:05.607
You know, you're a guy, maybe you
can explain this to me.

06:05.769 --> 06:08.329
Why is it that one moment guys
are sending out all of the signals,

06:08.489 --> 06:10.798
and then the next they
just turn them off like a switch?

06:10.969 --> 06:12.687
What do you men want anyway?

06:14.889 --> 06:18.768
Well, it's nice to see that while
romance may be dead, chivalry isn't.

06:19.449 --> 06:21.724
So, what's up, Morris?

06:23.169 --> 06:24.397
Four men have been killed

06:24.569 --> 06:27.447
over the last four nights
ever since this heat wave started.

06:27.889 --> 06:29.766
I think the murders
are gonna continue,

06:29.929 --> 06:32.762
- but I don't have any suspects.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

06:33.369 --> 06:37.282
Look, you and I have got this game
we play, right?

06:37.449 --> 06:40.088
You know that I know you got a secret.

06:40.289 --> 06:43.042
You also know
I don't wanna know what it is.

06:44.849 --> 06:47.522
But if in any way
it can help stop this...

06:48.729 --> 06:50.208
Oh, my God.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.441
What happened to them?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.685
Severe cerebral trauma.

06:57.849 --> 07:00.727
Although the medical examiner
can't figure out exactly how.

07:00.969 --> 07:02.641
He also can't figure out
how each of the men

07:02.809 --> 07:04.765
were drained
of all their testosterone.

07:05.449 --> 07:07.599
Not something you find every day.

07:07.849 --> 07:09.805
We need help on this one, Prue.

07:09.969 --> 07:12.244
The kind of help
I think only you can provide.

07:14.369 --> 07:16.325
Do the victims have
anything else in common?

07:16.489 --> 07:19.128
They were each members of
a dating service called Fine Romance.

07:19.289 --> 07:20.768
I've already got the place staked out,

07:20.929 --> 07:22.920
but they've got too many clients
for me to watch

07:23.089 --> 07:25.398
and too many potential suspects
for me to track.

07:25.569 --> 07:27.719
If the pattern continues,
somebody's gonna die tonight.

07:28.169 --> 07:32.162
- I know it, and I can't stop it.
- I'll see what I can do.

07:32.649 --> 07:36.608
I don't want you to get hurt.
Find out what you can, slip it to me.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.884
The brass is watching me on this one.

07:41.329 --> 07:44.207
This can't turn out to be
another unexplained case.

07:53.369 --> 07:56.805
I'm telling you, Piper,
last night's dream was no dream.

07:56.969 --> 08:01.008
Or a premonition, even.
It was real. I felt it.

08:01.169 --> 08:06.038
I was... I was so turned on,
and then...

08:06.529 --> 08:11.319
- And then I killed him.
- Phoebe, you didn't kill anyone.

08:11.489 --> 08:14.720
I could feel his body shake
uncontrollably beneath mine.

08:14.889 --> 08:16.117
Now you're making me sick.

08:16.289 --> 08:18.325
How do you think I feel? I'm living it.

08:18.489 --> 08:21.162
- I could still taste his blood.
- Okay.

08:21.889 --> 08:24.198
- Is anybody home?
- In here.

08:26.249 --> 08:27.921
It's not lunch yet.
What are you doing home?

08:28.089 --> 08:29.681
Morris came to visit.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.607
- Pheebs, are you okay?
- I'm so hot.

08:35.609 --> 08:37.839
100.5 degrees hot.

08:38.009 --> 08:39.885
But she won't go see a doctor.

08:40.448 --> 08:43.361
- What did Morris want?
- Help.

08:47.729 --> 08:49.082
Oh, my God.

08:52.969 --> 08:54.960
It's the guys. All of them.

08:55.129 --> 08:56.482
Phoebe, you were dreaming.

08:56.649 --> 09:00.767
Of each and every one of the victims?
I don't think so.

09:00.929 --> 09:03.124
I could see them
through my own eyes,

09:03.289 --> 09:07.919
- feel every touch, smell every smell.
- How long have you had this feeling?

09:08.489 --> 09:12.038
- The last four nights.
- Since the murders began.

09:12.449 --> 09:14.519
Coincidence? I think not.

09:14.689 --> 09:16.247
Well, maybe your powers are growing.

09:16.409 --> 09:18.639
Maybe you can get premonitions
in your sleep now.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.004
Or maybe you're just psychically linked
to the demon

09:21.169 --> 09:24.479
- on its wavelength or something.
- Or maybe I'm the killer.

09:25.889 --> 09:28.722
Come on, you guys,
it's not like there's no precedent.

09:28.889 --> 09:31.198
I mean, Piper turned
into a werewolf once, remember?

09:31.369 --> 09:32.882
- A wendigo.
- Whatever.

09:33.049 --> 09:34.880
Look, if you are
psychically connected,

09:35.049 --> 09:36.721
then maybe you can
go to the dating service,

09:36.889 --> 09:38.402
touch some of the tapes
of the suspects,

09:38.569 --> 09:40.127
see if you can get a psychic flash.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.008
It's worth a shot. Then I'll stay here
and see if I can find anything

09:43.169 --> 09:45.729
- in the Book of Shadows.
- I'm sorry, wait a minute.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.767
I tell you that maybe
I'm some kind of man-killing demon,

09:48.929 --> 09:50.920
and you want me
to go to bachelor central?

09:51.089 --> 09:52.442
Phoebe, we have to do something.

09:52.609 --> 09:54.964
Otherwise, someone else
is going to die tonight.

10:09.449 --> 10:12.009
Oh, look at the racks
on those babes, huh?

10:12.209 --> 10:14.325
Just do your job, Smith, okay?

10:14.569 --> 10:18.642
I am doing my job, Morris. I'm taking
pictures of potential suspects.

10:18.889 --> 10:21.961
If you ask me, those two suspects
got a lot of potential.

10:25.689 --> 10:29.079
Hi, welcome to Fine Romance.
I'm Darla. How can I help you?

10:29.249 --> 10:31.240
My sister Prue would like to sign up.

10:31.409 --> 10:32.478
- I would?
- Yes, you would,

10:32.649 --> 10:34.241
- while I look around.
- Right.

10:34.409 --> 10:38.197
Well, Prue, today is your lucky day,
because we are running a special.

10:38.369 --> 10:41.406
One year unlimited access
to our Internet and video library

10:41.569 --> 10:44.447
with a money-back guarantee
for only $3,500.

10:44.649 --> 10:48.278
Thirty-five-hundred bucks?
Okay, I could buy a man for that.

10:48.449 --> 10:50.644
Oh, I can always tell
the frustrated ones.

10:50.849 --> 10:53.727
You've been having man trouble lately,
haven't you?

11:01.609 --> 11:05.522
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

11:06.169 --> 11:10.640
It's not a problem.
It's not a problem at all.

11:13.249 --> 11:16.321
- Do you work here?
- Oh, no. Actually, I just...

11:16.569 --> 11:18.321
- I just signed up.
- Really?

11:18.529 --> 11:20.997
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's just that

11:21.169 --> 11:22.397
you don't seem like the type

11:22.569 --> 11:24.685
- that needs help finding a date.
- Ditto.

11:27.529 --> 11:31.238
- Oh, I'm Owen. Owen Grant.
- Phoebe.

11:39.849 --> 11:43.808
I have to go, okay?
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.800
- But, Phoebe...
- Sorry.

11:47.009 --> 11:51.127
Congratulations, Prue, your days
of having trouble with men are over.

11:51.289 --> 11:53.803
- See you at tonight's mixer?
- Okay.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.728
You know, for your information,
I do not have man troubles.

11:56.889 --> 11:58.766
Okay, financial ones now, yes,

11:58.929 --> 12:02.239
- but definitely not any man troubles.
- We're out of here.

12:02.409 --> 12:04.047
- It's all right.
- I don't, honest.

12:04.209 --> 12:06.598
- Tell her.
- She doesn't.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.687
Piper?

12:19.209 --> 12:20.483
You're back.

12:20.649 --> 12:23.447
- Did you find anything in the book?
- The book?

12:24.329 --> 12:26.559
Or were you too busy
looking at something else?

12:26.729 --> 12:29.960
I was looking.
You should see what I found.

12:30.409 --> 12:32.764
Oh, I see what you found all right.

12:33.809 --> 12:36.369
Great tan, nice body.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.802
"When a witch renounces
all human emotion

12:40.009 --> 12:42.569
and makes a pact with darkness
to protect herself from heartbreak,

12:42.729 --> 12:45.527
she becomes a succubus,
a sexual predator."

12:45.689 --> 12:47.759
Let me see that.

12:48.089 --> 12:51.718
"She seeks out powerful men who
become helpless against her magic,

12:51.889 --> 12:55.484
then feeds on their testosterone
with her razor-sharp tongue."

12:55.929 --> 12:58.966
So this monster is an evil,
sexually-charged witch?

12:59.129 --> 13:00.687
Yeah, but it's not you, Phoebe,

13:00.849 --> 13:02.919
because you didn't make a pact
with darkness, right?

13:03.089 --> 13:05.649
And as far as we know,
you don't have a razor-sharp tongue.

13:07.049 --> 13:10.359
Here's a spell to attract the succubus
and destroy it with fire.

13:10.529 --> 13:13.362
A flaming death for yours truly?
I don't think so.

13:13.529 --> 13:15.360
Well, we have to catch this thing,
right?

13:15.529 --> 13:18.566
So, what if I cast a spell to attract it,
and if it turns out to be you

13:18.729 --> 13:21.243
who's attracted to me,
then Piper will freeze the room,

13:21.409 --> 13:23.127
and we'll go from there.
Fair enough?

13:35.449 --> 13:38.646
"By the forces of heaven and hell
Draw to us this woman fell

13:39.329 --> 13:42.878
Rend from her foul desire
That she may perish as a moth to fire"

13:49.649 --> 13:54.325
- See? I knew it wasn't you.
- I didn't burn. I'm okay.

13:54.609 --> 13:55.962
I'm not.

14:00.529 --> 14:02.087
- Oh, my God.
- God.

14:04.289 --> 14:06.120
I don't believe it.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.967
We have a new problem.

14:20.969 --> 14:24.564
- Prue, please come out.
- Not until you reverse this spell.

14:24.729 --> 14:27.163
Come on,
it's been over an hour already.

14:28.329 --> 14:30.320
Do you think she's touching herself?

14:30.489 --> 14:32.764
The book doesn't say
anything about a reversal.

14:32.929 --> 14:36.205
Maybe you're supposed to stay a man
until you attract the succubus.

14:36.369 --> 14:38.087
- Well, I'm not going anywhere.
- See?

14:40.689 --> 14:42.919
You don't really have a choice.

14:43.089 --> 14:45.523
I'm thinking we need to get you
to the dating service,

14:45.689 --> 14:48.442
since that's where the succubus
picks her victims.

14:48.609 --> 14:51.282
That is actually a really good idea.
She could...

14:51.449 --> 14:53.519
He can sign up
like the rest of the guys.

14:53.729 --> 14:55.685
Hey, I'm not signing up for anything.

14:56.409 --> 15:00.084
Lives are at stake, Prue.
Innocent men are going to die.

15:01.569 --> 15:04.242
We're your sisters, Prue,
you don't have to be embarrassed.

15:04.409 --> 15:05.808
We're not gonna laugh.

15:08.129 --> 15:10.438
How can I save anyone?

15:12.449 --> 15:14.644
Okay, I look ridiculous.

15:15.409 --> 15:18.481
I am wearing clothes
from the ex-boyfriends' pile,

15:18.649 --> 15:21.209
I have hair in strange places,

15:21.369 --> 15:25.521
and I have a penis. This is not funny!

15:26.729 --> 15:30.039
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

15:32.609 --> 15:35.077
Prue, you don't actually
have to date anyone.

15:35.249 --> 15:38.241
All you have to do is make yourself
seen and available.

15:38.409 --> 15:40.604
You know, Prue,
the sooner you trap the succubus,

15:40.769 --> 15:42.646
the sooner you'll become
a woman again.

15:44.969 --> 15:46.925
That's easier said than done.

15:50.009 --> 15:52.398
Okay, confidence.
The walk, the talk, the handshake,

15:52.569 --> 15:54.241
it's all about confidence.

15:54.409 --> 15:57.242
- Sports. Men like sports.
- And sincerity, that's key.

15:57.409 --> 15:59.604
But what really makes a man
is the clothes he wears,

15:59.769 --> 16:01.361
the car he drives
and the money he earns,

16:01.529 --> 16:03.679
- according to Cosmo.
- You're supposed to be helping.

16:03.849 --> 16:05.521
Okay, let's work on your walk.

16:05.729 --> 16:09.244
All you have to do is visualize a man
that you admire and then emulate him.

16:09.409 --> 16:10.637
You know, the walk will follow.

16:10.809 --> 16:12.606
A man that I admire.
All right, I got that.

16:12.769 --> 16:14.760
Okay.

16:19.129 --> 16:21.927
The man you admire
is Richard Simmons?

16:26.409 --> 16:29.845
Okay, I will get Morris' files,
try to put together a list of attributes

16:30.009 --> 16:32.204
the succubus is attracted to.
You two get the door.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.400
- What?
- Well, think of it as a practice run

16:34.569 --> 16:35.797
for the dating service.

16:35.969 --> 16:39.120
Oh, oh, I know. Tom Hanks.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.200
Everybody loves Tom Hanks.
Think of him.

16:41.369 --> 16:43.280
- Tom Hanks.
- Everybody loves him.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.646
Okay.

16:48.809 --> 16:50.083
- Dan.
- Hi.

16:50.249 --> 16:52.809
I didn't mean to interrupt,
but my freezer broke down,

16:52.969 --> 16:56.564
and I wanted to see if I can get
some ice from you guys.

16:57.409 --> 17:00.924
Oh, Dan, this is... This is...
This is Manny.

17:01.089 --> 17:04.843
Manny Hanks. He's my friend.

17:05.009 --> 17:07.569
Well, it's nice to meet you, Manny.

17:07.729 --> 17:10.289
- Piper, come in here quick.
- Okay, coming.

17:10.449 --> 17:12.723
- I'll be right back with that ice.
- Oh, wait, no.

17:13.049 --> 17:14.482
He's a good man.

17:15.569 --> 17:19.881
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

17:21.969 --> 17:24.278
So have you known the sisters long?

17:24.969 --> 17:28.200
I'm the brother that they never had.

17:30.729 --> 17:32.959
- What happened?
- I just...

17:33.129 --> 17:36.724
I had another one of those hot flashes,
the succubus vision.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.279
Piper, I think I really am psychically
connected to that thing.

17:40.449 --> 17:43.327
I see what she sees,
feel what she feels.

17:44.449 --> 17:45.848
I felt excited.

17:46.449 --> 17:49.043
Excited happy or excited aroused?

17:49.209 --> 17:52.087
Piper, she's in heat, okay?
And so am I.

17:52.249 --> 17:54.319
Well, that explains
why you're burning up.

17:54.489 --> 17:56.798
Your libido must be connected
to the succubus.

17:56.969 --> 17:59.164
Yeah, well, it's like
I have no control over it.

18:04.089 --> 18:05.807
It just happened again.

18:06.449 --> 18:09.088
I saw egg sacs.

18:10.369 --> 18:11.768
Oh, my God.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.886
I think she's pregnant
or ready to hatch.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.961
You mean there's gonna be
a whole brood of them killing men?

18:17.129 --> 18:21.088
Unless we stop her,
I think that's exactly her plan.

18:21.729 --> 18:24.402
So Piper isn't seeing anyone.

18:25.849 --> 18:29.637
- No, not really.
- Then Piper is seeing someone.

18:30.129 --> 18:33.519
No. Not really.

18:35.249 --> 18:38.047
Look, I would just hate
to see her with a guy who,

18:38.249 --> 18:40.683
oh, let's say on the third date,
just runs away.

18:40.849 --> 18:45.320
- Don't you just hate men like that?
- I don't know any men like that.

18:47.609 --> 18:50.362
How about those Niners?

18:52.369 --> 18:55.202
- Okay, here's your ice.
- Oh, thanks.

18:55.369 --> 18:57.246
Oh, you're welcome. Okay, bye-bye.

18:58.009 --> 19:00.682
Take care.
Tell Jenny we said hi, okay?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.805
- Okay.
- All right. Good.

19:03.929 --> 19:08.047
- So?
- Oh, we're in big trouble. Huge.

19:11.289 --> 19:14.759
You know, I think that it's the smaller
things that I look for in a relationship.

19:14.929 --> 19:15.918
You know, like

19:16.289 --> 19:21.443
listening to your partner,
kindness, respect.

19:21.889 --> 19:24.119
And as far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing

19:24.289 --> 19:28.043
sexier, nothing hotter
than someone who respects him...

19:28.729 --> 19:30.321
Herself.

19:31.369 --> 19:35.567
Because you know if she respects
herself then she respects others.

19:37.489 --> 19:40.606
Can I just say that you are really
in touch with your feminine side.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.401
You have no idea.

19:46.569 --> 19:48.958
His name is Owen.
He signed up earlier today.

19:49.729 --> 19:52.880
- Dr Owen Grant?
- Doctor?

19:53.089 --> 19:54.408
Yeah, I guess that's him.

19:54.569 --> 19:57.527
Do you have any way I can get
in touch with him? It's really important.

19:57.689 --> 20:00.487
Well, you could join for $3,500
and view his tape.

20:10.769 --> 20:14.398
- I do not believe it.
- What?

20:14.569 --> 20:18.642
Looks like neighbour Dan
signed up too. Interested?

20:25.409 --> 20:26.683
Let's go.

20:31.249 --> 20:34.400
Boy, a guy could do some serious
damage in there, you know?

20:34.689 --> 20:37.328
Just drop all the pretence
and go a little caveman.

20:38.409 --> 20:40.161
You're really something,
you know that, Smith?

20:40.329 --> 20:42.923
I know it.
That's what the ladies tell me.

20:43.649 --> 20:44.638
Man.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.686
- It's boiling.
- Yeah, it is.

20:48.249 --> 20:51.525
- Think I'll do a little investigating inside.
- No, you're not going anywhere.

20:51.689 --> 20:54.761
Come on, it's a mixer, right?
I wanna go inside and mix it up.

20:57.409 --> 20:59.206
Do you think the succubus
already got to Owen?

20:59.369 --> 21:00.563
I mean, what if we're too late?

21:00.729 --> 21:02.162
You would have
had a psychic flash

21:02.329 --> 21:04.240
if we were,
and since you haven't, we're not.

21:04.409 --> 21:05.922
Oh, there he is.

21:07.489 --> 21:10.208
Hey, you know,
maybe I should take him back

21:10.369 --> 21:12.519
to the manor to keep him safe.

21:12.969 --> 21:15.164
You and him at the manor, alone?

21:15.329 --> 21:18.321
- I'm just gonna talk with him.
- Well, you can just talk with him here.

21:18.489 --> 21:21.401
I'm gonna go back to the video area
and check up on Prue.

21:22.049 --> 21:23.880
Don't forget Dan's tape.

21:28.569 --> 21:30.560
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

21:32.129 --> 21:33.881
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:35.009 --> 21:38.206
So, what you're saying is, my video will
now be available to all of your clients.

21:38.369 --> 21:39.688
So, what with Internet access,

21:39.849 --> 21:41.646
I should be able to meet women
as soon as when?

21:41.809 --> 21:45.245
Mr Hanks, something tells me that you
could be dating as soon as tomorrow.

21:45.409 --> 21:47.843
This is one great tape.

21:49.889 --> 21:53.086
I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this.

21:53.249 --> 21:56.127
Oh, come on.
Your sister paid for this, Mr Gordon.

21:56.289 --> 21:58.723
- You can do it.
- No, this just isn't me.

21:58.889 --> 22:01.449
Give it a try.
Just speak from your heart.

22:01.609 --> 22:04.601
- What do you look for in a woman?
- What do I look for?

22:06.409 --> 22:09.048
I don't know, I'm old-fashioned,
I guess. I...

22:10.609 --> 22:12.600
I look for the girl next door.

22:13.049 --> 22:16.883
Someone with a good heart,
good personality and looks to match.

22:17.049 --> 22:20.678
The kind of girl that, when I leave
for work in the morning,

22:21.569 --> 22:27.917
I wait just a little bit,
until she leaves for work too,

22:29.289 --> 22:35.319
just to catch a glimpse
of that long dark hair and great smile,

22:35.929 --> 22:40.719
hoping that maybe one day
she'll notice that I'm watching,

22:41.249 --> 22:43.604
and she'll smile back at me.

22:51.009 --> 22:52.567
Do you...?

22:53.089 --> 22:55.728
Do you wanna get out of here
and take a walk or something?

22:57.289 --> 23:02.966
- I would love to really, but I can't.
- You can't? Why not?

23:03.129 --> 23:04.767
Oh, it's hard...

23:05.609 --> 23:10.080
...I mean, to explain, you know?
Is it really hot in here?

23:10.249 --> 23:13.047
You know what? I'm gonna get you
something to drink. I'll be right back.

23:13.209 --> 23:15.564
Okay. All right.

23:23.249 --> 23:26.321
Oh, no. She's here.

23:27.209 --> 23:29.882
- Piper!
- Hey, what's going on? Are you okay?

23:30.049 --> 23:32.483
Yeah, we need to get out of here
fast, okay? Follow me.

23:33.209 --> 23:36.884
If you could just stand here for a
minute and just stay in my sight, okay?

23:37.049 --> 23:38.118
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:40.209 --> 23:42.086
- She's here. I felt her.
- What? Where is she?

23:42.249 --> 23:44.046
I don't know, but she's in the room
somewhere.

23:44.209 --> 23:46.803
- She could be after Owen.
- Well, then get him out of here.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.482
- Fast!
- Okay.

23:48.649 --> 23:50.082
Where you going there, honey?

23:50.249 --> 23:51.238
Excuse me.

23:51.409 --> 23:54.606
No, no, no, I'd like to have a little talk
with you, huh? In private.

23:59.649 --> 24:02.561
What the hell's the matter
with you, Smith? Let her go!

24:03.849 --> 24:06.761
Manny, it's Owen. Take him out fast.

24:10.849 --> 24:14.046
What are you doing? Your powers.

24:14.209 --> 24:16.564
Hey, hey, that's enough, all right?
You're under arrest!

24:18.929 --> 24:20.487
That's it. You're under arrest, pal.

24:20.649 --> 24:23.402
Cuff the other one, Smith.

24:26.409 --> 24:30.527
This is...
This is bad. This is really bad.

24:34.009 --> 24:35.806
It's getting worse.

24:35.969 --> 24:38.881
The succubus isn't attracted
to Owen anymore.

24:39.089 --> 24:42.764
- She's attracted to Prue.
- Perfect.

24:50.849 --> 24:54.637
You want me to release him?
Your friend punched a cop.

24:54.809 --> 24:57.721
Four men have died in the last
four nights, but none so far tonight.

24:57.889 --> 25:00.608
- Why do you think that is?
- Because of Manny, that's why.

25:00.769 --> 25:04.125
And if he stays in jail,
another innocent man might get killed.

25:04.649 --> 25:07.083
I suppose you want me
to release this...

25:07.409 --> 25:10.287
- This Dr Owen Grant too, huh?
- No.

25:10.449 --> 25:12.280
Actually, he's still a potential victim.

25:12.449 --> 25:15.168
As long as he's here, he's safe.
You can't let him out.

25:19.329 --> 25:23.163
This is going to bite me in the ass.
I know it is.

25:30.409 --> 25:33.321
You know, I'm surprised
we men ever get anything done.

25:33.489 --> 25:35.923
You know, all I seem
to think about is sex.

25:36.129 --> 25:38.802
It's like it's non-stop,
very debilitating.

25:39.529 --> 25:42.282
Tell me about it.
Hey, did you fix the air conditioning?

25:42.449 --> 25:44.485
Yeah, I just had to clean the filter.

25:44.649 --> 25:47.209
Airflow clog must've thrown
the breaker.

25:48.489 --> 25:52.448
Guess who that was.
Alan from Buckland's.

25:52.609 --> 25:53.962
Alan? Wait, he actually called?

25:54.129 --> 25:55.881
Yeah, and he wants
to go out with you again.

25:56.089 --> 25:59.240
- So much for our rejection theory.
- Well, what did you tell him?

25:59.409 --> 26:02.401
I went out on a limb and told him
you were feeling a bit hormonal.

26:03.169 --> 26:07.685
102.5 degrees.
Probably normal for a succubus.

26:07.889 --> 26:11.086
But not so good for you.
I really think you should call a doctor.

26:11.249 --> 26:12.762
Piper, there's nothing that he can do.

26:12.929 --> 26:16.399
It's the connection with the succubus.
It's getting stronger.

26:16.569 --> 26:18.958
Probably because she missed
her nightly feeding.

26:19.129 --> 26:22.678
She didn't get Owen or Prue.
She needs to kill, I can feel it.

26:22.929 --> 26:26.080
- Okay, what are we gonna do?
- All right, I got a plan.

26:26.249 --> 26:28.001
The dating service called.
Turns out my video

26:28.169 --> 26:31.241
broke some kind of house record.
Twenty hits this morning.

26:31.409 --> 26:34.287
One of them might be the succubus,
so I lined up dates with all of them.

26:34.449 --> 26:35.643
- What?
- Yep,

26:35.809 --> 26:37.208
at your club tonight starting at 6.

26:37.369 --> 26:40.088
No, no, not tonight. The Cranberries
are coming in for a sound check

26:40.249 --> 26:42.809
before the benefit tomorrow.
I can't risk scaring them away.

26:42.969 --> 26:46.086
Oh, that's no problem. I'll just nail
the succubus before they get there.

26:46.249 --> 26:47.807
Oh, you're gonna nail her, are you?

26:47.969 --> 26:50.688
Okay, so this whole man thing,
this sort of short-circuits

26:50.849 --> 26:54.046
the old maybe-l-should-consult-
my-sisters wiring now, doesn't it?

26:54.209 --> 26:56.279
Just step right in and take over.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.679
Didn't start happening
until she sucker-punched Owen.

26:58.849 --> 27:02.603
- Well, you had a problem, I fixed it.
- Oh, you bet your butt you did.

27:02.769 --> 27:05.806
- You nearly broke his jaw.
- I saved his life.

27:05.969 --> 27:08.847
Look, you're the one who told me
I had to practice being a man, right?

27:09.049 --> 27:12.121
So I acted on instinct. And to tell you
the truth, the moment that I hit him,

27:12.289 --> 27:14.757
I felt powerful and strong,
like somehow that made me a man.

27:15.449 --> 27:18.646
You wanna know how to be
a real man? Look at Dan.

27:18.809 --> 27:21.528
Honest, kind, good heart.

27:21.689 --> 27:25.079
The type of guy who would risk being
late to work just to make you smile.

27:25.249 --> 27:26.648
Not some bully who walks around

27:26.809 --> 27:29.448
thinking one punch
is gonna change anything.

27:32.449 --> 27:34.644
She learned all that
just from looking out a window?

27:40.049 --> 27:44.088
Oh, yeah, nice body, great tan.

27:45.649 --> 27:47.401
Awesome truck.

27:49.169 --> 27:52.241
You know, I think you really are
becoming a man.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.448
Oh, man. Look at that. Look at that.

27:59.609 --> 28:01.725
I can hardly even see out of that,
and you let him walk.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.800
Why don't you try looking
at the club for a while.

28:03.969 --> 28:06.563
The sooner we catch the perp,
the sooner I can have you reassigned.

28:09.369 --> 28:13.567
I just hope that the succubus
gets here fast, because I am dying.

28:13.929 --> 28:15.806
Okay, focus on the plan.

28:16.729 --> 28:20.278
Manny lures the succubus
into the alley, and then I freeze her...

28:20.449 --> 28:23.919
And then he uses
his testosterone-charged powers

28:24.089 --> 28:27.525
to fend her off
until she bursts into flames. I got it.

28:33.809 --> 28:36.277
Did Manny just check out
that girl's butt?

28:36.449 --> 28:39.407
Oh, God, this is starting to get weird.

28:39.609 --> 28:42.362
It's starting to get weird?
Where you been?

28:45.169 --> 28:47.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:52.049 --> 28:56.645
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- No. Sorry, should I?

28:58.889 --> 29:02.677
I work at Buckland's
with Prue Halliwell.

29:04.049 --> 29:08.008
- Manny. Manny Hanks.
- Alan Stanton. Nice to meet you.

29:08.569 --> 29:12.687
- So you know Prue, huh?
- Yeah, we go way back.

29:13.329 --> 29:16.560
Yeah, well, Prue and I
actually dated a few times.

29:17.969 --> 29:19.607
When it comes
to dating women these days,

29:19.769 --> 29:21.600
I just can't figure out what they want.

29:22.129 --> 29:25.041
It's a real confusing time to be a man.

29:25.609 --> 29:28.965
- You mean, like in what way?
- Like every way.

29:29.129 --> 29:31.723
I mean, even opening doors
or pulling out chairs.

29:31.889 --> 29:33.481
Some women expect it,
other women hate it.

29:33.649 --> 29:36.322
You never know which camp
they're in until it's too late.

29:36.489 --> 29:38.002
Well, which camp
do you think Prue's in?

29:38.169 --> 29:40.000
Prue?

29:40.169 --> 29:43.923
The good one, the one that likes it.
She's cool.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.885
I had no idea. I mean...

29:49.489 --> 29:51.605
You know, I bet she had no idea.
Have you told her?

29:52.609 --> 29:56.284
Are you kidding? Probably scare
her away if I haven't already.

29:57.289 --> 29:59.086
Where's Prue? I lost her. Him.

29:59.249 --> 30:00.841
She's over there talking to A...

30:02.369 --> 30:03.404
What?

30:04.089 --> 30:08.321
The succubus. She's here.
I'm seeing what she's seeing.

30:08.529 --> 30:10.360
- What? Where is she?
- She's here somewhere.

30:13.209 --> 30:14.437
She just spotted Prue.

30:16.969 --> 30:20.006
Wait. Isn't that the woman
from the dating service?

30:20.169 --> 30:21.921
The one that videotaped Prue?

30:22.409 --> 30:24.525
You know Prue,
she's on the rebound.

30:24.689 --> 30:27.157
And I respect her too much
to force the issue.

30:27.769 --> 30:29.919
I didn't wanna move too fast.

30:30.089 --> 30:33.399
Although I think about it now, maybe
I went too slow and got her mad at me.

30:34.169 --> 30:36.763
Same damn confusing rules,
you know what I mean?

30:36.969 --> 30:38.322
Yeah, I'm beginning to.

30:42.769 --> 30:43.963
- Yeah?
- Prue, she's here.

30:44.129 --> 30:45.198
Get to the alley quick.

30:45.369 --> 30:47.803
It's Jan from the dating service,
the one in the red dress.

30:47.969 --> 30:51.086
Right, on my way.
Sorry, Alan, gotta go.

30:53.009 --> 30:57.560
Hi. Hi. Jan, right?
From Fine Romance?

30:57.769 --> 30:59.202
Yes. Have we met?

31:07.169 --> 31:08.443
It's not you.

31:15.289 --> 31:16.688
Hello, Manny.

31:20.929 --> 31:23.682
- What's happening to me?
- You're falling in love.

31:23.889 --> 31:27.086
You want me. You need me.

31:27.329 --> 31:31.163
Tell me I'm irresistible. Tell me.

31:32.089 --> 31:33.363
You're irresistible.

31:41.569 --> 31:43.321
What happened?
Why didn't you use your power?

31:43.489 --> 31:45.241
I was trying to use it,
and it wouldn't work.

31:45.409 --> 31:47.479
- And then I felt like I was...
- Impotent?

31:47.649 --> 31:49.640
You know, a little advice
about men, Phoebe.

31:49.809 --> 31:52.528
When we fail at something, generally
we don't like to hear the word...

31:52.689 --> 31:53.838
- Impotent?
- Yeah...

31:55.969 --> 31:57.482
Oh, no!

31:58.489 --> 31:59.968
Freeze right there!

32:02.969 --> 32:05.005
Stop, or I'll shoot! Stop!

32:18.409 --> 32:22.163
She's dead, but I don't know
what the hell that was.

32:22.489 --> 32:24.923
- You guys okay?
- I think so.

32:25.089 --> 32:26.886
Looks like you got your collar.

32:28.569 --> 32:30.480
Okay, how come I'm still a man?

32:37.049 --> 32:38.880
Toxicology won't be back for a week,

32:39.049 --> 32:41.324
but the preliminary blood panel
did show something odd.

32:41.489 --> 32:44.287
This woman's endocrine system
showed high levels of testosterone.

32:44.449 --> 32:45.723
Testosterone?

32:46.329 --> 32:48.479
How...? How's that even possible?

32:48.649 --> 32:50.287
I won't know for certain
until the autopsy,

32:50.449 --> 32:51.802
but if it turns out to be accurate,

32:51.969 --> 32:54.199
you've definitely got the killer
you've been looking for.

32:54.369 --> 32:56.519
I tell you, there's something
really weird about this.

32:56.729 --> 32:58.685
It's a real shame. She's a babe.

33:27.849 --> 33:32.206
I don't understand. It says,
to attract and destroy the succubus,

33:32.409 --> 33:35.719
she will come to us
and burst into flames.

33:35.969 --> 33:38.005
Yeah, well, it came all right,

33:38.249 --> 33:41.400
but it certainly didn't burst.
And worse, I'm still a man.

33:41.809 --> 33:44.960
What I don't understand is,
why wasn't I able to use my power?

33:45.129 --> 33:46.403
I don't know.

33:51.369 --> 33:54.088
You know, men are just as afraid
of being rejected as women are.

33:54.729 --> 33:57.243
Trust me. I mean, that's probably
why Dan hasn't asked you out.

33:57.409 --> 33:59.047
He's afraid you'll say no.

33:59.209 --> 34:01.279
Like you'd know.

34:01.489 --> 34:03.480
- Do you?
- I'm a guy, aren't I?

34:05.089 --> 34:09.400
You guys, the succubus,
she's still alive. I felt her kill again.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.958
- Oh, no.
- Why wasn't I able to destroy her?

34:12.208 --> 34:15.042
- We can still finish this.
- How?

34:15.248 --> 34:17.364
I mean, she knocked me out, guys.
I mean,

34:17.529 --> 34:20.565
really, it was like I was in a trance.
I was weak in the knees.

34:20.728 --> 34:23.083
And for a moment,
I felt her need not to be rejected

34:23.248 --> 34:24.841
as though it would devastate her.

34:25.248 --> 34:27.524
Great, we're dealing
with a sensitive man-killing demon.

34:28.089 --> 34:30.398
Yeah, well, we gotta be missing
something. You keep looking.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.366
I gotta go take a leak.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.565
All right, don't forget
to put the seat back down.

34:34.728 --> 34:36.764
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:36.969 --> 34:40.438
- Anything there?
- No, nothing at all.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.277
Phoebe?

34:47.809 --> 34:49.208
She's here.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.679
The succubus, she's in the house.

34:53.289 --> 34:54.563
Prue!

34:55.529 --> 34:57.838
Prue! Where'd she go?

35:01.609 --> 35:06.364
I watched your tape
over and over again.

35:06.569 --> 35:09.447
The things you said, I...

35:10.329 --> 35:12.923
You can't resist me.

35:16.169 --> 35:18.603
We have to find Prue, Phoebe,
or she's dead.

35:20.009 --> 35:21.840
I'm connected again.

35:22.769 --> 35:25.158
- I'm seeing Prue. She's alive.
- Okay, where is she?

35:25.329 --> 35:29.083
The same place the other victims
were, but I don't know where that is.

35:29.249 --> 35:32.958
God, I'm gonna watch her kill Prue,
and there's nothing I can do about it.

35:33.289 --> 35:34.722
Wait, listen to me. I have an idea.

35:34.889 --> 35:37.528
If you are connected to the succubus,
then the succubus

35:37.689 --> 35:39.964
- is connected to you, right?
- What are you talking about?

35:40.129 --> 35:42.006
You have to reverse
the psychic connection.

35:42.169 --> 35:44.842
You have to use your power
to project back to the succubus

35:45.009 --> 35:47.842
to help Prue resist her.
What's the succubus saying?

35:48.449 --> 35:52.601
- Tell me you want me.
- I want you.

35:53.009 --> 35:55.125
- She wants Prue to want her.
- Okay.

35:55.289 --> 35:58.042
Talk through the succubus,
tell Prue that she doesn't want her,

35:58.209 --> 36:00.165
she'll never want her. Tell her.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.883
- Tell me you need me.
- I need you.

36:03.489 --> 36:06.162
Talk to Prue like she's
right in front of you, Phoebe.

36:06.569 --> 36:08.560
Tell her that she's not a man,
she's a woman.

36:08.889 --> 36:10.038
Tell me

36:10.209 --> 36:12.598
- You're not a man. You're a woman.
- That you're a woman.

36:12.809 --> 36:14.527
- I'm a woman.
- What?

36:14.729 --> 36:17.243
You can resist, Prue.
Only a man is...

36:17.409 --> 36:18.808
- powerless against me?

36:18.969 --> 36:22.757
I can resist you.
In fact, I'm rejecting you.

36:22.929 --> 36:26.399
What? You can't resist me!
I'm irresistible!

36:26.569 --> 36:28.287
Not to me, you're not, you bitch.

36:53.929 --> 36:56.966
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

36:58.489 --> 37:01.049
- And so is Prue.
- What about the succubus?

37:01.209 --> 37:02.278
She's dead.

37:12.729 --> 37:16.722
Oh, well, well, and I thought
the heat wave was over.

37:16.889 --> 37:20.040
- Yeah, Prue, you look hot.
- I'm just grateful to be back in heels.

37:20.209 --> 37:23.406
Well, let me see. Oh, yeah,
you definitely have that walk down.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.281
Well, we'll see
if Alan agrees with that.

37:25.489 --> 37:27.719
Oh, Alan. I thought
you thought he wasn't interested.

37:27.889 --> 37:30.244
Yeah, I was wrong.
Just a little gender confusion.

37:30.409 --> 37:33.719
Looks like you learned a few things
about being a woman by being a man.

37:33.889 --> 37:36.323
Actually, I did.
I mean, we're different,

37:36.489 --> 37:39.049
which I'm glad about that,
but we're also similar in many ways.

37:39.249 --> 37:41.717
You know,
we all feel the same emotions.

37:42.329 --> 37:44.160
It's just that if we don't
communicate honestly,

37:44.329 --> 37:47.207
then we read between the lines
and tend to get everything screwed up.

37:47.369 --> 37:51.760
And sometimes it's just up to us
to open the door first, take a chance.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.960
Oh, you finally called him, huh?

37:54.209 --> 37:56.439
I got some good advice
from the brother I never had.

37:56.609 --> 37:58.645
- Excuse me.
- You're welcome.

37:59.369 --> 38:01.929
- So, what about you, Pheebs?
- Me?

38:04.609 --> 38:08.568
I actually have an appointment
with a doctor I've been dying to see.

38:09.289 --> 38:12.599
- I'm still running a little bit hot.
- I see that. He winked at you.

38:12.769 --> 38:15.442
Folks, it's a real pleasure
for me to introduce,

38:15.609 --> 38:18.362
in a one-night-only benefit
for the Animal Rights Fund,

38:18.569 --> 38:19.843
The Cranberries!

38:55.089 --> 38:56.283
Glad you could make it.

38:56.449 --> 38:58.440
Are you kidding?
I'm just glad you called.

38:59.169 --> 39:02.241
Truth is, I've been wanting
to call you for some time now.

39:02.449 --> 39:04.644
Really? I never would've guessed.

39:05.329 --> 39:07.365
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

39:20.289 --> 39:23.998
- Alan, hey, good to see you.
- I'm glad you called back, Prue.

39:24.169 --> 39:26.729
I have to admit
that I didn't think you would.

39:26.889 --> 39:29.881
Well, I wasn't going to at first,
but then I...

39:30.409 --> 39:33.481
I met this really nice guy,
and he encouraged me to go ahead.

39:33.689 --> 39:36.442
Yeah, well, who is he?
I wanna thank him.

39:36.849 --> 39:40.285
Oh, I'll thank him. Cranberries.

39:40.449 --> 39:42.041
Let's go.
