00:18.309 --> 00:20.270
[theme song plays]

00:37.162 --> 00:38.038
[Zach] Clay.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.582
Clay, help me!

00:41.458 --> 00:42.542
[Clay] He was hurt.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.252
Dying.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.549
And I couldn't help him.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.259
[distant sirens wail]

00:52.093 --> 00:53.970
[indistinct voice over radio]

00:55.430 --> 00:57.140
[Clay] I just watched him bleed.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.100
[indistinct voice over radio]

00:59.517 --> 01:01.519
Jesus, Clay. Come on. Help me.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.812
-Uh...
-[tires screech]

01:02.896 --> 01:04.773
-[crashing]
-[sirens wail]

01:05.648 --> 01:06.608
[Justin] Clay!

01:06.691 --> 01:08.860
-[brakes squeal]
-[smashing]

01:08.943 --> 01:11.154
Clay! Clay, what the fuck?

01:11.571 --> 01:13.490
[Kerba] And... time!

01:17.494 --> 01:19.662
I'm afraid
your victim didn't make it, guys.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.207
[exhales shakily]

01:22.957 --> 01:25.919
-[Clay] Sorry.
-[Kerba] Let's see how other teams did.

01:27.170 --> 01:31.549
Wow. You guys really nailed it, huh?
Really nice work on the bandages too.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.303
I just figured close range
with a clean exit point.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.098
Probably best to apply constant pressure
with a compress.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.641
It would really be more realistic

01:39.724 --> 01:43.228
for us to deal with a high-velocity,
high-impact wound,

01:43.311 --> 01:45.063
like a .223 from an assault rifle.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.941
Those are illegal in California, no?

01:48.733 --> 01:50.110
No, yeah, they are.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.115
Hey, great work, everyone.

01:55.824 --> 02:01.871
Look, I know this can be a tough exercise,
but it only takes two to five minutes

02:01.955 --> 02:05.083
for someone to bleed out
from a gunshot wound. Right?

02:05.667 --> 02:06.876
Our goal today is to...

02:06.960 --> 02:09.838
[Clay] A tourniquet would do fuck-all
when a single bullet

02:09.921 --> 02:11.923
from anÂ AR-15 rips open your insides.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.383
So, how about this?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.051
Instead of teaching us to stop the bleed,

02:15.135 --> 02:17.512
they make it less likely
we'll actually get shot

02:17.595 --> 02:21.391
at our own fucking high school?
Wouldn't that make more sense?

02:21.474 --> 02:24.394
It must be upsetting
to go through that kind of training.

02:25.228 --> 02:29.190
This is when I lose respect for you,
when you ask the most obvious question.

02:30.024 --> 02:34.154
[Ellman] Would you rather I presume
to know how you feel without asking?

02:34.654 --> 02:36.156
OK, now you're just arguing.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.116
[Ellman] I don't mean to be.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.871
How'd the stop-the-bleed exercise
make you feel?

02:42.954 --> 02:43.955
[Clay sighs]

02:45.415 --> 02:46.374
Helpless.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.796
It's awful. Feeling helpless
is the worst feeling there is.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.299
-Tell me why.
-I mean, isn't that obvious?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.009
Let's say it's not.

02:56.676 --> 03:00.013
Why is feeling helpless,
for you, the worst feeling there is?

03:00.555 --> 03:02.640
Is helping people important to you?

03:05.476 --> 03:06.895
Isn't that important to you?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.731
Very, and sometimes I can't help them.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.235
And what do you do?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.572
Well, I try...

03:18.656 --> 03:20.617
everything I know to try.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.704
I consult with colleagues,

03:26.831 --> 03:28.041
but in the end,

03:30.335 --> 03:32.295
if I can't help a patient,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.380
then I try to find someone who can.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.680
[Clay] But after all that,

03:43.890 --> 03:46.017
are certain people beyond help?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.101
[Ellman] I hope not.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.729
Do you worry that you're beyond help?

03:51.689 --> 03:52.565
Yeah.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.110
[Ellman] A few sessions ago,
we talked about how you punish yourself.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.529
Do you think you deserve to be punished?

04:02.116 --> 04:03.201
[Clay] I think I do.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.329
I feel like I've let my friends down

04:06.412 --> 04:08.623
and I'm not there for them
like I should be.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.292
[Justin] I've been asking around
trying to find him.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.710
Pizza place doesn't know.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.755
So he meets up with Tyler
and then just disappears?

04:16.172 --> 04:20.260
He hasn't been in the neighborhood.
I went and asked around the docks.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.553
I told you not to go down there.

04:22.845 --> 04:23.680
Oh.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.056
You "told me."

04:25.139 --> 04:28.226
You never did say what you were doing
there in the first place.

04:28.309 --> 04:32.063
Tony, my recovery is strong enough
to see some familiar faces.

04:32.146 --> 04:35.858
Forgive me if I'm not a big believer
in people recovering at the moment.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.653
We don't know Tyler slipped.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.698
We don't know for sure what we even saw.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.284
Really? What did it look like to you?

04:44.659 --> 04:48.830
Yeah, but there's been nothing since,
right? Has he done anything?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.581
Said anything weird?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.833
He's Tyler.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.960
He says weird shit all the fucking time.

04:56.087 --> 05:00.717
-Should we tell Alex about what we saw?
-You think we should tell Alex.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.969
Now I know you're worried.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.682
I believe in Tyler.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.394
I want to.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.604
[tense music plays]

05:17.942 --> 05:20.862
[Clay] I made a bunch of messes
I don't know how to clean up.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.740
Hey.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.825
Welcome back.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.161
Welcome back?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.163
Fuck you!

05:31.039 --> 05:32.165
[under breath] Jesus.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.250
Zach, I...

05:35.793 --> 05:37.253
I don't know what happened.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.215
You mean after you crashed my car
and ditched me.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.135
I don't remember anything.
You gotta believe me.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.013
From before the party, Justin told me
all kinds of crazy shit happened,

05:47.096 --> 05:50.224
-and I don't remember.
-At some point, you had to have realized

05:50.308 --> 05:52.602
you crashed my car
and left me for dead. Right?

05:54.145 --> 05:56.439
I swear to God, I don't remember.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.193
[Zach sighs]

06:00.443 --> 06:01.361
Zach.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.865
You know, the crazy thing is...

06:08.326 --> 06:09.786
you didn't even seem scared.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.664
No, your eyes,
it was like you weren't even there.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.292
It was like you were... somebody else.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.710
[scoffs]

06:17.794 --> 06:22.799
Right before you drove my car off the edge
and sent me flying 30 fucking feet.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.218
-Zach, I am so sorry.
-[sighs]

06:25.301 --> 06:28.096
Don't worry about it.
My lawyer says he can get me off.

06:28.179 --> 06:31.432
He has a lot of practice.
He was Bryce's lawyer. [snickers]

06:31.933 --> 06:33.142
It's funny, right?

06:33.726 --> 06:34.977
Um, no.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.648
Correct.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.068
None of this is fucking funny anymore.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.862
You are a goddamn nightmare, so please...

06:46.614 --> 06:48.408
please just stay the fuck out of my life.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.159
Forever.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.292
[Clay] I've just... I've lost friends.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.169
I've made enemies.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.130
I need my life to change,

07:03.047 --> 07:05.007
something to, like, wake me up.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.594
He just sat there
and let the dummy bleed out.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.264
Luke, he saw the whole thing.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.807
Said it was fucking creepy.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.852
Oh. Well, maybe he didn't like
the sight of blood.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.230
It's kind of fucked up
they're making us learn that stuff.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.983
I'm just saying.
He's this close to full-blown psycho now.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.070
Well, that wouldn't have anything to do
with you and your boys, would it?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.656
I told you,
we're not messing with him anymore.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.200
We got other ways
to figure out what he's hiding.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.788
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Just that he's got a lot of friends...

07:36.581 --> 07:38.624
and one of them
is bound to know something.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.587
Well, you'd better not do anything stupid,

07:42.670 --> 07:45.131
or you're just gonna get yourself
suspended again.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.091
Good thing
I'm dating the school president.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.802
Which means
you really don't want to piss me off,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.806
especially when we're having
so much fun together.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.153
Sit, Mr. Jensen.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.908
Not to be rude, but, like, who are you?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.034
Dean Foundry.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.995
Dean is your name or your title?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.706
Title. I'm the new dean of discipline.
Sit.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.003
Wait.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.838
Dean of which now?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.174
[Foundry] The district feels
it needs a more active role

08:28.257 --> 08:29.967
in monitoring the student body

08:30.051 --> 08:33.095
and managing disruptions
to the learning environment, and...

08:34.222 --> 08:36.891
it seems they're right,
judging from the smashed security cameras

08:36.974 --> 08:39.185
we've been dealing with
for the past two weeks.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.648
Can you account for your whereabouts
between midnight and 7:00 a.m. today?

08:44.106 --> 08:46.150
-I'm guessing I was in bed.
-Guessing?

08:46.567 --> 08:47.652
I was in bed.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.112
-What time did you arrive at school?
-I don't know.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.240
-9:30 or something.
-Or something?

08:53.824 --> 08:56.202
-9:30.
-9:47, actually.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.411
Almost two hours late.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.372
I was in an appointment.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.748
Right, ask my mom.

09:00.831 --> 09:01.958
I already have done.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.754
She wasn't aware of any appointment.
She'll be speaking with you tonight.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.924
Anything you wanna tell me
about the cameras?

09:10.007 --> 09:12.134
Or who might have seen fit
to destroy them?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.011
No. Nothing I want to tell you.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.806
Well, if you think of anything later,
I'm always here.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.183
Now, back to class.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.065
Take good care.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.278
Wait. How...

09:31.070 --> 09:34.949
How did you know
that I got here at exactly 9:47?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.200
I know a lot, Clay.

09:36.909 --> 09:37.827
Get to class.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.579
[tense music plays]

09:42.540 --> 09:43.416
[Jess] Hey!

09:44.041 --> 09:45.793
Congrats on the interview.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.381
-Uh, what? What are you talking about?
-Brown.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.925
Uh, the alumni reps are coming next week.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.177
I saw the schedule on Bolan's desk.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.263
That's gotta be a mistake. I...

09:57.597 --> 09:59.974
Not unless
there's another Clay Jensen around here

10:00.057 --> 10:01.934
I don't know about, which is, like...

10:02.602 --> 10:03.894
One is enough.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.148
But you...

10:07.690 --> 10:09.609
you did apply there, didn't you?

10:11.068 --> 10:12.111
I, uh...

10:12.903 --> 10:14.071
I mean, I guess.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.741
[ominous music plays]

10:16.824 --> 10:18.326
[tapping keyboard]

10:29.503 --> 10:30.630
[door opens]

10:31.839 --> 10:32.798
[Estela] Hi.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.010
I didn't realize the door under the stairs
led anywhere.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.262
-Hi.
-It's quiet down here in the mornings.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.555
I get work done.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.933
I looked through
my brother's stuff like you asked.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.393
The police kept most of it,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.563
but I thought this might be something
to look at.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.524
-Schoolwork?
-A football playbook.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.319
I don't understand the plays or anything,

10:53.402 --> 10:57.573
but while the coaches taught the plays,
the guys wrote notes to each other.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.992
Monty, Bryce, Diego.

11:00.409 --> 11:05.748
There's, like, two years' worth,
from before and after Bryce died.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.840
OK. "Es dudoso que...

11:16.175 --> 11:18.010
lloverÃ¡ maÃ±ana."

11:19.512 --> 11:20.680
What?

11:21.263 --> 11:22.098
What?

11:22.848 --> 11:23.808
Nothing.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.770
See, you're using "que,"
so it has to be the subjunctive.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.730
The subjunctive mood can also be used

11:29.814 --> 11:32.608
when expressing a speaker's feelings
about a perceived reality.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.151
"I'm sorry you're cold."

11:34.235 --> 11:36.362
Siento que tengas frÃ­o.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.866
Tony, I'm sorry you have to hear this.
You could school us both.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.536
Yes, but it wouldn't be
nearly as entertaining.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.121
-[Alex laughs]
-[PA beeps]

11:45.204 --> 11:47.206
[Bolan] May I have your attention, please?

11:47.289 --> 11:50.418
We are currently moving
into a lockdown situation.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.669
Code Red.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.629
This is a hard lockdown.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.299
Staff, please initiate
lockdown procedures immediately.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.303
Students, please do not panic,
and listen closely to this announcement

12:01.387 --> 12:03.264
and the instructions of your teacher.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.475
Seek immediate shelter
in the nearest classroom.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.520
I repeat. This is a Code Red.
Hard lockdown.

12:09.603 --> 12:13.858
-Code Red. That's active shooter, right?
-Yeah, it's gotta be another stupid drill.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.401
[Foundry] OK, listen up, please!

12:15.484 --> 12:17.153
I need students
to help barricade the doors.

12:17.236 --> 12:21.240
-You, you. You three, let's go.
-[boy] Come on, let's go. Come on.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.827
He, uh, doesn't look like
he was expecting a drill.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.413
-[Foundry] Let's get those lights off.
-What is it?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
Tyler's gone.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.333
[tense music plays]

12:33.794 --> 12:37.798
The rest of you, stop what you're doing
and you need to shelter under the tables.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.634
[students chatter nervously]

12:46.682 --> 12:47.808
[girl] Right here.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.477
Tony, hey.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.853
Hey, what is it?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.230
Yeah, what do you know?
What's up with Tyler?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.733
[sighs] I think he's been buying guns.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.945
[panicked breathing]

13:01.363 --> 13:04.742
OK, everybody,
just stay down, stay quiet.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.836
[gasps]

13:27.973 --> 13:29.058
Come on. Quicker.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.936
Why can't we do this bullshit
when I have English?

13:36.649 --> 13:37.691
[Kerba] Hey, Justin.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.569
Once everyone's inside, lock the doors.
You know the protocol.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.572
All right, Coach.
This is just a drill, right?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.324
I'll see what I can find out.

13:45.699 --> 13:49.578
Hey, towards the back, in the showers.
Away from the doors.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.205
All right? Y'all stay low.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.006
[panicked panting]

14:05.302 --> 14:06.303
Hey, man.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.305
You OK?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.268
[shakily] Code Red means it's real, right?

14:13.894 --> 14:14.895
Hey, check it.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.439
No windows. Cement walls.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.277
And if someone does try and come in here,
we... we handle it.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.696
No one's getting hurt today.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.574
No talking.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.742
[footsteps approach]

14:29.952 --> 14:33.622
Why so concerned? Your boy Clay bring
something bigger than a knife this time?

14:34.665 --> 14:36.500
I've got a right to know.
I'm on his list.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.169
-That's not even funny.
-No shit, it's not.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.671
[keys jingle]

14:42.840 --> 14:43.924
[Clay pants]

14:44.466 --> 14:45.384

[door rattles]

14:48.012 --> 14:49.638
[ominous music plays]

14:53.475 --> 14:54.435
[sighs]

14:55.311 --> 14:56.395
[Clay] For instance,

14:56.478 --> 14:59.273
I thought I helped my friend Tyler
after his assault,

15:00.065 --> 15:02.192
but now I'm not sure I helped him enough.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.378
Or if I helped him at all.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.675
[metal clanging, door rattling]

15:26.884 --> 15:27.843
Oh, fuck.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.306
-[panicked breathing]
-[door opens]

15:33.766 --> 15:34.850
-[door closes]
-No!

15:55.245 --> 15:57.831
[inhales, exhales slowly]

15:57.957 --> 15:58.832
Fuck!

16:02.628 --> 16:05.422
-Saw that one coming, didn't you?
-[Clay gasps]

16:07.424 --> 16:08.968
[sighs] It's just a drill.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.720
-What if you're wrong?
-I'm not.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.472
-What if it's Tyler?
-It's not.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.057
Because what?

16:15.474 --> 16:16.642
He's better now?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.020
Because it's a drill,

16:20.521 --> 16:21.689
and, yes, he's better.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.024
What reason would he have
to do this again?

16:25.025 --> 16:26.402
Same reason as before.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.448
Me, everyone who treated him like shit
since he was seven.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.868
You of all people should know that.
That shit doesn't just go away.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.913
It haunts you for the rest
of your fucking life... [inhales sharply]

16:38.539 --> 16:39.957
...which may end today.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.458
Fuck off.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.260
[Monty] Are you scared?

16:51.677 --> 16:54.722
Are you feeling what terror actually is?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.808
The feeling of sitting here helpless,

16:57.891 --> 17:00.060
and death is on the other side
of that door.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.229
Yes.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.398
-[Monty] Yes what?
-I'm scared!

17:10.654 --> 17:11.488
Yeah.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.115
I know that feeling.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.827
[suspenseful music plays]

17:24.877 --> 17:25.878
[sniffs]

17:25.961 --> 17:27.171
[call tone rings]

17:29.298 --> 17:32.259
[voicemail] At the tone,
please record your voice message.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.343
[voicemail beeps]

17:33.719 --> 17:35.804
Hey, Mom, it's me, Estela.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.725
I know you're at work,
but... just thought I'd call.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.936
They're doing one of those drills again.
I'm sure it's nothing,

17:44.271 --> 17:45.731
but you always said to call.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.527
[sobs] I love you...

17:51.487 --> 17:53.113
so much.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.533
-[choked sobs]
-[phone beeps]

18:10.422 --> 18:12.091
[Zach groans] Come on.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.308
[footsteps approaching]

18:23.018 --> 18:25.479
Jesus. Fuck! [sighs]

18:27.731 --> 18:28.816
What are you doing?

18:29.942 --> 18:30.984
Code Red.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.612
Shooter.
Did you not hear the announcement?

18:34.154 --> 18:35.197
No.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.117
I was in the darkroom, I had these on.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.618
[Zach] So...

18:42.955 --> 18:44.373
should we wait to die?

18:47.835 --> 18:48.919
Vicodin, huh?

18:49.378 --> 18:51.338
That's for the car accident?

18:51.421 --> 18:52.422
Uh-huh.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.675
And the vodka?

18:55.425 --> 18:56.677
That's just for fun?

18:57.636 --> 18:59.513
Sorry, I can smell it from here.

18:59.596 --> 19:03.183
Dude, you try walking around
with a broken arm and a fucked-up knee.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.770
If you keep judging me,
I'm lockin' you back up in your cave.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.771
No, I'm...

19:09.314 --> 19:10.357
not judging.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.947
But maybe you want to try something

19:18.115 --> 19:20.117
that might actually take the pain away.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.580
[Clay] We're all, like, isolated,

19:25.497 --> 19:26.957
trying to make sense of it.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.626
Trying to hold on.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.838
[shakily] Can I get my phone?

19:34.214 --> 19:36.675
Sorry, Rob. We need to stay low, OK?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.552
[Rob breathes shakily]

19:38.635 --> 19:41.054
I just wanna text my parents
just to say goodbye.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.223
Hey. None of that.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.017
No goodbyes.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.145
Hey...

19:49.938 --> 19:52.065
don't they usually tell you in advance...

19:53.150 --> 19:54.234
if it's a drill?

19:54.735 --> 19:55.986
[Rob sobs quietly]

19:59.448 --> 20:00.782
[Kerba sighs heavily]

20:03.410 --> 20:04.494
All right, look.

20:04.578 --> 20:08.248
We're all gonna be fine. We just need
to sit tight till the all-clear.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.791
Or we nut up and bring the hurt

20:09.875 --> 20:12.211
instead of just waiting around
like sitting ducks!

20:12.294 --> 20:15.422
What the fuck are you gonna do?
Swing at the bullets? Don't be stupid.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.715
At least I'm not a coward.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.842
-So you admit to being stupid?
-That's enough!

20:18.926 --> 20:22.888
-Just set an example. Both of you.
-I take offense to being called stupid

20:22.971 --> 20:25.682
by a recovered addict
who still gets shit-faced at parties.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.017
You fuckin' kidding me?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.268
-Hey, Justin.
-Let's go.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.188
Listen, Justin.
Let's go check the doors in the office.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.404
[Clay] Maybe we all have that moment
of "what the hell have I done?"

20:39.988 --> 20:41.531
What do you think you're gonna find?

20:41.949 --> 20:42.991
Anything.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.452
Something to tell me not to lose my shit.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.371
He doesn't want to hurt anyone.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.873
Not anymore. You guys know he's better.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.208
I'm not sure what I know.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.628
Charlie, you and me,
we spend more time with him than anyone.

20:54.711 --> 20:58.006
[Charlie] But didn't something change
after the cops called him in?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.341
What the fuck?

21:06.598 --> 21:10.102
OK, there's gotta be an explanation.
It's not what we think.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.104
Or it's exactly what we think.

21:13.021 --> 21:16.191
We have to turn these in and tell someone.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.569
Wait, hold on.
We don't know that this isn't a drill.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.196
Do you really wanna risk that?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.074
If it's real, what good will it do
to turn the photos in?

21:24.157 --> 21:25.826
-You think it'll stop this?
-It might!

21:25.909 --> 21:29.037
There's a chance.Â If there's a chance,
we gotta do something.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.623
We don't know that it's Tyler.
My dad said he was fine.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.709
Maybe your dad thinks
everything's fine for you.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.626
What does that mean?

21:34.710 --> 21:37.087
That I'm the one
who threw Tyler's guns away,

21:37.170 --> 21:41.925
and if I gave him a second chance,
and he comes in, and he does this--

21:42.009 --> 21:45.929
All right, let's just take a second,
and we can think about what we need to do.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.473
If you're wrong about this,
his life is over.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.185
If he goes down, how long do you think
it's gonna be before we all go down too?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.397
[Clay] Maybe we're all terrified
to find out

21:55.480 --> 21:57.190
just what the hell have we done.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.525
OK.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.446
Do we protect everyone or just ourselves?

22:03.530 --> 22:04.948
[tense music plays]

22:06.908 --> 22:07.868
It's a drill.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.749
-Can't stop thinkin' about Tyler?
-[Bryce] Maybe it's not Tyler.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.667
Maybe it's another kid.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.378
There's, what, 1,000 kids at this school?

22:18.712 --> 22:21.006
You think Tyler's the first
to think about taking a gun

22:21.089 --> 22:24.134
and shooting as many kids as he could
before he died himself?

22:24.801 --> 22:26.678
Nah, I'm still Team Tyler.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.972
No, Tyler's better.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.932
You... you saw that.

22:31.016 --> 22:35.228
I did, but your plan's
kinda falling apart, isn't it?

22:36.563 --> 22:38.273
You don't know what Tyler's up to.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.193
I don't care. It's not my problem anymore.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.819
[Bryce] It's not your problem?

22:42.903 --> 22:47.657
So you don't think if someone out there
put a gun to the head of, say, Jessica,

22:47.741 --> 22:49.451
you don't think she'd rat you out?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.161
Oh, or Alex? Or Zach?

22:51.244 --> 22:54.247
Or Justin. Jesus.
I bet he'd piss his little pants.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.041
No, he wouldn't. None of them would.

22:56.124 --> 22:59.211
OK, what about you?
What would you do with a gun to your head?

22:59.294 --> 23:00.629
I've had a gun to my head.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.673
I've had an AR-15 here.

23:04.383 --> 23:08.387
Right here, and I survived,
and I did the right thing.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.264
[Bryce] 'Cause you're Clay Jensen.
You're Liberty High's hero.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.517
You've stared down the barrel
once already.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.978
Hell, you drove off the road 'cause
you're not scared of anything, right?

23:19.648 --> 23:20.649
Are you a hero

23:21.274 --> 23:22.234
or a martyr?

23:22.984 --> 23:23.985
[door rattles]

23:27.364 --> 23:28.949
[breathes heavily]

23:30.367 --> 23:32.994
It's just a teacher, checking the locks.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.496
Maybe.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.670
[Clay sighs]

23:42.045 --> 23:45.507
So you're not afraid to die,
just as, like, a general thing?

23:46.383 --> 23:48.468
Maybe I just don't care anymore.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.513
You say that,
but speaking from experience,

23:51.596 --> 23:56.143
you really do 'cause once you're gone,
all that's left is the shit you didn't do.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.938
Or the shit that you did do,
but you did wrong.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.192
I always tried to do the right thing.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.193
Did you?

24:06.611 --> 24:08.029
If you die today,

24:09.114 --> 24:10.699
is your conscience clear?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.617
I'm not dying today.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.579
No one can ever say that and know.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.539
-[door rattles]
-[exhales sharply]

24:28.091 --> 24:29.050
Fuck.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.993
-Have you been in here the whole time?
-I'm sorry.

25:37.661 --> 25:41.498
I was gonna say something earlier,
but then I heard you talking on the phone,

25:41.581 --> 25:43.792
and I heard you say your name.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.587
Oh... right.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.218
I'm sorry we haven't ever,
like, officially met.

25:53.718 --> 25:58.306
I was gonna say something, sometime,
but I just didn't know what to say.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.391
It's fine.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.351
I get it.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.311
[Tyler sniffles]

26:04.563 --> 26:05.814
It's just a drill.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.900
At least that's what I think it is.

26:09.651 --> 26:10.569
Yeah.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.071
It's just...

26:14.489 --> 26:17.951
[choked sob] ...this is the last place
in the world I want to be.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.540
Oh...

26:30.839 --> 26:33.842
[Clay] Everyone's past is the reason
for what they do today.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.349
[sighs]

26:45.353 --> 26:46.271
Hi, Ani.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.939
Hey, it's me, Jess.

26:49.691 --> 26:53.695
Look, I'm sorry I haven't texted you
or called you at all.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.531
I hope your mom's doing OK.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.954
Listen, uh, the night that you left,
you said something.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.080
You said, um...

27:05.248 --> 27:08.084
hating weakness doesn't make us stronger.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.214
I thought I knew what you meant, but...
[sighs]

27:15.717 --> 27:17.344
...now I don't know.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.597
I was just wondering...

27:22.641 --> 27:23.850
if you meant me?

27:29.022 --> 27:30.649
Sorry. Anyway... [chuckles]

27:30.732 --> 27:34.402
...you don't, um, need to call me back,
I'm being dumb.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.696
I'll talk to you.

27:40.742 --> 27:41.743
I miss you.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.081
Tell your mom I said get well.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.627
Bye.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.214
[phone beeps]

27:56.174 --> 27:57.175
Dude...

27:59.219 --> 28:00.303
shit's weak.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.389
I don't feel anything.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.977
I expected quality premium substances
from you, Hillcrest boy.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.606
[sighs] You have eaten

28:12.524 --> 28:14.401
all of the yearbook's snacks.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.028
-That's the last of my lunch, so...
-[snickers]

28:17.862 --> 28:18.905
...you're stoned.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.076
Mm-mm. You're talking to the guy
that's been fucked up for half a semester.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.577
I think I'd know if I was...

28:26.287 --> 28:27.831
[both snicker]

28:36.756 --> 28:39.551
So why are you always fucked up?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.639
It's fuckin' high school, man.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.101
[sighs] People suck.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.646
Your friends suck.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.734
I learned that in Burnham Woods.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.278
You talkin' about what happened with Alex?

28:59.487 --> 29:00.530
You know about it?

29:01.990 --> 29:02.907
Yeah.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.034
So, yeah.

29:05.493 --> 29:08.705
Come to me when your boyfriend
breaks up with you for no reason

29:08.788 --> 29:11.916
and won't even look at ya
and basically hates your guts.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.960
Don't pretend to be innocent, OK?

29:14.043 --> 29:15.086
You lied to him.

29:16.004 --> 29:19.507
How's anybody supposed to believe
you actually gave a shit about Alex?

29:19.883 --> 29:22.761
I do give a shit about Alex.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.096
-I give lots of shits.
-Mm-hmm.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.599
I wasn't playing him.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.559
I loved him.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.978
I still do.

29:32.061 --> 29:32.896
Yeah?

29:32.979 --> 29:35.690
What did you love about him exactly?

29:37.358 --> 29:38.359
He's, like,

29:38.818 --> 29:40.820
the kindest person I've ever met.

29:45.992 --> 29:46.951
Yeah.

29:49.662 --> 29:50.497
Wait.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.999
Are you in love with him too?

29:53.082 --> 29:54.125
No.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.255
But I.. [stammers]

30:00.799 --> 30:01.841
I do love him.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.386
He's a good person, really.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.015
I've done a lot of fucked-up shit, and...

30:10.767 --> 30:12.101
he never judges me.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.773
You've done some shit?

30:17.232 --> 30:18.650
Like what?

30:18.733 --> 30:19.776
[tense music plays]

30:19.859 --> 30:21.945
[footsteps approach]

30:22.362 --> 30:23.696
Oh, shit.

30:24.948 --> 30:25.824
Fuck.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.493
[Zach gasps]

30:28.993 --> 30:30.787
[Zach breathes heavily]

30:31.788 --> 30:33.206
Oh, shit. Did you see that?

30:36.918 --> 30:37.877
Fuck.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.131
-This isn't a drill.
-[breathes heavily]

30:43.174 --> 30:45.760
[Clay] And we try to clean up
the messes we've made.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.970
He's our friend, Tony.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.222
I know that. Of course I know that.

30:49.305 --> 30:52.183
We all want to protect Tyler
and believe that he's better.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.018
-What if we're wrong?
-Yeah.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.520
-[loud banging]
-[gasping]

30:55.603 --> 30:57.313
-What was that?
-[gunshots]

30:57.397 --> 30:58.481
[girl] Oh, shit.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.191
[panicked gasping]

31:03.611 --> 31:06.406
Fuck this. I'm taking this stuff
to Foundry right now.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.449
What...? No! [gasps]

31:12.537 --> 31:14.414
Alex, are you OK?

31:14.497 --> 31:15.498
[Alex] I did this.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.293
[gasps] Everyone's gonna die,
and it's all my fault.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.919
[Charlie] What? No.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.422
Tony was right.
Maybe we coulda stopped him.

31:22.505 --> 31:23.464
[panicked] I fu...

31:23.548 --> 31:26.175
I fucked this up
like I fuck up everything! [wheezes]

31:26.259 --> 31:28.428
Alex, hey, listen to me. Listen.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.181
[breathes wheezily] I can't breathe.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.892
I think I'm dying.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.727
Huh? Uh...

31:36.477 --> 31:39.981
Focus on your hands.
What do you feel like? Describe it to me.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.816
I don't fucking know!

31:41.900 --> 31:43.109
[labored breathing]

31:43.526 --> 31:45.153
Just squeeze my hands.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.821
OK, you can do that.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.489
Come on. I know you can.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.657
[Alex grunts]

31:49.741 --> 31:52.827
Come on, Alex. Focus on me. OK?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.454
-Just breathe.
-OK.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.956
-Breathe.
-[gasping breaths]

31:57.332 --> 31:58.499
[whispers] You got it.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.045
It's gonna be OK.

32:03.671 --> 32:04.714
Just breathe.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.215
[breathing becomes calmer]

32:10.595 --> 32:11.971
[Tyler] I think he's gone.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.641
[Estela] Do you think
he'll find us in here?

32:15.016 --> 32:16.142
[Tyler] I don't know.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.604
Sounds like he's moving away,
but if he comes back,

32:19.687 --> 32:21.856
bathroom doors can make great shields.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.692
They're two layers
of a really heavy metal.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.527
We're gonna be fine.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.698
Why would someone do something like this?

32:32.408 --> 32:34.243
Maybe they're in a lot of pain,

32:36.245 --> 32:38.456
and they think that this'll make it stop.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.627
Why would hurting someone else
make it stop?

32:43.461 --> 32:44.462
[Tyler] It doesn't,

32:45.546 --> 32:47.548
but you don't know that. You're just...

32:48.633 --> 32:50.176
You're so sad,

32:51.636 --> 32:53.721
and that sadness makes you angry...

32:54.472 --> 32:55.807
all the time.

32:55.890 --> 32:59.852
[sniffs] Like you thought making a fist
would feel good,

33:00.228 --> 33:01.229
and it does.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.814
You feel strong again,

33:02.897 --> 33:04.273
but then you can never...

33:04.774 --> 33:06.484
never unclench that fist,

33:06.567 --> 33:07.944
and you just feel like...

33:08.861 --> 33:11.114
like you just need to hurt someone else.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.784
Did you hurt someone else?

33:17.578 --> 33:18.746
I almost did,

33:20.707 --> 33:21.916
but my friends...

33:22.667 --> 33:24.043
helped me get better.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.964
I'm glad that you didn't do anything.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.302
Me too.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.725
I'm sorry for what my brother did to you,

33:41.269 --> 33:43.438
everything that you had to go through.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.024
Thank you.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.861
I wonder
if Monty could have gotten better...

33:50.862 --> 33:52.238
if he had the chance.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.074
I guess, yeah.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.993
He fucked up,

33:59.370 --> 34:00.913
but I loved him.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.626
[voice trembles]
He was lucky to have you for a sister.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.047
It means he had something good
in his life.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.133
[holds back sob]

34:16.721 --> 34:18.056
[Jess] Mom. Hi.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.269
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. [chuckles]

34:23.352 --> 34:24.270
I just, um...

34:24.353 --> 34:28.691
I was on my free period,
and I was just missing you guys.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.028
How's Seattle?

34:36.949 --> 34:38.409
Oh, that's so cool!

34:40.953 --> 34:42.705
I can't wait to visit you guys.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.212
How are Elijah and Cooper?

34:56.677 --> 34:59.097
Oh, my God. You're kidding me?
[chuckles]

35:02.767 --> 35:06.354
Can you tell them I love them...
for me, please?

35:07.230 --> 35:08.272
[chuckles]

35:10.316 --> 35:11.234
Yeah.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.529
[suspenseful music plays]

35:20.660 --> 35:22.370
[distant gunshots]

35:24.080 --> 35:25.289
Hey, Mom, um...

35:25.832 --> 35:27.917
I actually have to go now.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.713
Yeah.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.427
I love you.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.809
[chuckles] OK.

35:45.643 --> 35:46.519
Bye.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.566
[phone beeps]

35:55.528 --> 35:57.280
[distant gunshots]

35:59.740 --> 36:01.492
[choked sobbing]

36:06.497 --> 36:09.709
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doin'? Get back in there.

36:09.792 --> 36:12.420
Those were gunshots. We can't sit here
and let people get killed.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.173
[Kerba] Look,
that hero talk ain't worth your lives.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.175
I'm done hiding, and I don't run.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.845
No, see, you fight as a last resort only.

36:20.928 --> 36:23.723
Now go sit the fuck down.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.435
All right, come on, Diego.

36:28.477 --> 36:29.812
People are scared.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.397
Well, I ain't scared.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.482
I'm ready to fight.

36:33.983 --> 36:34.859
[Justin] OK.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.989
[Diego] Why aren't you, Foley?
You don't want to stand and fight?

36:40.072 --> 36:42.283
You don't even know where Jessica is,
do you?

36:42.617 --> 36:45.036
You're OK to just let her die.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.497
Fuck!

36:48.581 --> 36:50.291
Hey. OK, enough!

36:50.374 --> 36:53.002
-[players murmuring]
-Back in there!

36:53.085 --> 36:54.045
Let's go!

36:55.421 --> 36:58.132
Coach, come on, please!
I don't wanna die like this!

36:59.342 --> 37:02.386
If this is the last day of my life,
I want to be doing the right thing.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.764
It's not gonna be
the last day of anyone's lives.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.390
No one's goin' anywhere, OK?

37:06.474 --> 37:08.559
-[buzzer sounds]
-[gasps]

37:08.684 --> 37:11.103
OK, everyone. Sit down!

37:13.606 --> 37:14.607
Head count.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.401
[buzzer continues sounding]

37:18.861 --> 37:19.820
Coach...

37:21.572 --> 37:22.573
Foley.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.037
-[players muttering]
-[breathes heavily]

37:28.537 --> 37:30.164
[ominous music plays]

37:33.376 --> 37:35.628
[Clay] We try to unburden ourselves.

37:35.711 --> 37:38.547
I can't believe I survived
a roll-over crash for this.

37:40.466 --> 37:43.135
Death is playing games with me.
It's just a matter of time.

37:43.469 --> 37:46.013
-[distant buzzer sounds]
-And no offense, 'cause...

37:46.806 --> 37:49.308
you're actually cooler
than I thought you were gonna be, but...

37:52.019 --> 37:53.562
I don't wanna die with you.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.231
Don't worry.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.150
I don't wanna die with you either.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.236
[inhales, exhales slowly]

38:01.529 --> 38:03.239
-[distant gunshots]
-[Zach] Jesus.

38:03.781 --> 38:04.824
[sighs]

38:05.366 --> 38:06.409
Jesus!

38:06.617 --> 38:07.868
[strangled laughter]

38:11.163 --> 38:13.541
Listen, if...

38:15.626 --> 38:18.462
if I die and you live...

38:19.672 --> 38:20.715
[strangled sobbing]

38:24.969 --> 38:26.971
...will you tell him something for me?

38:27.054 --> 38:28.139
Alex?

38:29.765 --> 38:30.599
Yes.

38:31.684 --> 38:35.646
Will you tell him
he's the first boy I ever truly loved?

38:40.192 --> 38:42.194
-OK.
-[breathes heavily]

38:42.737 --> 38:43.779
Yeah, I'll do that.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.914
-[sighs]
-I beat up Bryce.

38:54.790 --> 38:55.708
What?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.460
The night he died,

38:58.461 --> 38:59.503
I beat him up.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.716
-You killed him?
-No.

39:04.925 --> 39:08.346
No, I went to the police. They told me
that he didn't die from getting beaten up.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.598
I still feel like shit, though.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.435
That maybe he wouldn't have died
if it wasn't for me.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.399
If I die,

39:22.735 --> 39:23.736
and you live,

39:25.112 --> 39:26.364
would you please...

39:29.784 --> 39:31.952
would you tell Miss Walker that I'm sorry?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.374
Of course.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.519
See? Now that would freak me out.
That sounds like more than just a drill.

39:56.602 --> 39:57.520
Mm, a lot more.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.230
Shut up! Just... just...

39:59.313 --> 40:00.940
just shut up!

40:01.023 --> 40:03.359
OK. Say it isn't Tyler.
Say it's another kid.

40:03.442 --> 40:06.028
Oh, like little Roddy Corman
who stood up at the assembly.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.156
I don't know why anyone would want
to fuck with that little shit. [chuckles]

40:09.240 --> 40:12.284
-Jesus, you're disgusting.
-OK. Whatever. Sorry.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.870
It's that sweet, young Roddy.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.330
He just couldn't go on.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.417
Or it's another kid, gets beat at home.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.794
Tryin' to figure out his sexuality.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.754
Angry all the time.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.965
Why aren't you saving him?

40:27.341 --> 40:28.843
Tyler was my friend.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.345
So only your friends deserve to be saved.

40:32.513 --> 40:37.476
-Everyone deserves to be saved.
-[Bryce] Then why aren't you saving him?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.061
Then why didn't you save me?

40:39.145 --> 40:40.020
And me?

40:42.106 --> 40:45.151
Now, what happens
when one of those doors opens, Clay?

40:45.693 --> 40:48.154
Some sub didn't know
you need to pull on the door,

40:48.237 --> 40:50.322
so the deadbolt
goes into the strike plate.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.158
Didn't get locked all the way.

40:52.241 --> 40:56.495
Kid gets the door open, and he sees
20 sophomores huddled under two tables.

40:57.329 --> 40:58.497
There's nowhere to run.

Fish in a barrel.

You know, he's got a 60-round magazine
and a bump stock,

41:04.545 --> 41:06.088
and they're gone in a minute.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.967

skulls shattered.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.972

41:16.891 --> 41:18.434

41:25.357 --> 41:28.110
So now 23 kids and a teacher are dead.

41:28.903 --> 41:32.239
She died trying to shield them.
The bullets went right through her.

41:35.367 --> 41:36.452
Clay, that kid,

41:37.578 --> 41:39.413
the kid that you couldn't save,

41:40.915 --> 41:42.708
-what happens to him now?
-[sobs]

41:42.791 --> 41:45.961
[Bryce] Does he still deserve to be saved,
or should he die?

41:46.670 --> 41:48.506
No one should die.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.133
Before he got to those sophomores
under the table in the room

41:51.217 --> 41:54.136
with the broken door,
before he got there,

41:54.637 --> 41:56.514
-he shot Tony.
-[Clay, strangled] No!

41:56.597 --> 41:58.098
He shot Alex...

41:58.682 --> 41:59.975
he shot Justin,

42:01.435 --> 42:02.770
and you couldn't stop it.

42:03.979 --> 42:05.439
You couldn't save anyone.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.027
[inhales deeply, sniffs] I...

42:12.571 --> 42:15.115
[choked] I can't save anyone.

42:19.328 --> 42:20.704
I never could.

42:23.624 --> 42:26.252
-And you found this in Tyler Down's bag?
-Yes, sir.

42:27.002 --> 42:30.589
I thought, what if this is him, right?

42:31.840 --> 42:33.050
No, it's good thinking.

42:33.842 --> 42:37.137
No, it's good you brought it to me.
I'll certainly look into this.

42:38.681 --> 42:41.850
Are you going to do something,
like, now, like something?

42:41.934 --> 42:43.102
-Call someone?
-Hush.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.688
I think it's best we handle it
after the lockdown.

42:45.771 --> 42:48.148
But what if there's something
you can do now, and--

42:48.232 --> 42:50.150
There's nothing to be done right now.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.444
-We'll handle it.
-How?

42:53.028 --> 42:54.446
-We'll handle it.
-Fuck.

42:54.530 --> 42:56.782
Thank you, Mr. Padilla. No, stay here.

of what we carry is too much.

That's my dad.

43:44.163 --> 43:44.997
What?

43:46.123 --> 43:48.000
My dad. He's out in the hallway.

No, that's my dad! He's right out there.
Can't you hear him?

He needs to shut up.

-No, it's my dad.
-You two, down, now.

Alex, it's the TBI. OK?
You're not hearing your dad.

It's your brain making you think you are.

-He's not there. It's the stress.

What do we do then?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.578
That... was surprising.

52:04.871 --> 52:07.999
Surprising good or surprising bad?
[chuckles]

52:13.922 --> 52:15.298
Well, you two recovered.

52:15.799 --> 52:16.675
Kind of.

52:18.927 --> 52:22.055
-[Charlie] What?
-[sighs] Well, I shoulda seen that comin'.

52:22.556 --> 52:24.224
Wait, what did Foundry say?

52:25.392 --> 52:28.061
He, uh, said he was gonna look into it,

52:29.062 --> 52:32.941
and then he said he heard from the office
that this was just a fucking drill.

52:33.024 --> 52:37.404
OK, so if the cops bring him in again,

52:38.989 --> 52:40.574
what is that gonna mean for us?

52:52.127 --> 52:54.713
What I said earlier,
about what happened with Bryce.

52:55.380 --> 52:57.883
I was super out of it.

52:58.800 --> 53:03.013
And even though you didn't kill Bryce
that night, you don't want to be known

53:03.096 --> 53:05.974
as the guy who beat the shit out of him
before he died, right?

53:06.766 --> 53:07.642
Yeah.

53:08.727 --> 53:09.644
Exactly.

53:10.562 --> 53:11.479
Don't worry.

53:13.231 --> 53:14.482
I can keep a secret.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.360
Thanks, man.

If you know for a fact
you didn't kill Bryce,

then you must know who did, right?

53:35.045 --> 53:36.463
-[Bolan] Fantastic job.
-Thanks.

53:36.546 --> 53:38.256
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, sir.

53:38.715 --> 53:42.052

for your expertise, for your training.

53:55.607 --> 53:59.361
Clay, would you take a seat
in my office, please?

53:59.444 --> 54:02.530
No! I will not take a seat in your office!

54:02.614 --> 54:05.533
You think that this is the way
to make us safe?

54:06.076 --> 54:08.203
You know what would make me feel safe?

54:08.286 --> 54:10.747
Not having to go to a school
with metal detectors

54:10.830 --> 54:13.750

54:18.129 --> 54:19.631
[Clay] No, you're killing us!

54:20.006 --> 54:22.550
You are killing us! Don't you get that?

54:22.634 --> 54:24.302
You made a drill with gunshots

54:24.386 --> 54:26.846
and hammered down the door
to prepare us for what?

54:26.930 --> 54:28.556
What it feels like to be hunted?

54:28.640 --> 54:32.269
To practice getting ready to die,
to make us feel afraid for our lives?

54:32.852 --> 54:35.772
We already know how that feels!
You're scaring us to death!

54:35.855 --> 54:38.942

We should be living our fucking lives

54:48.034 --> 54:50.912
instead of practicing how to cheat death,
because you know what?

Everybody fucking dies!

That's what every minute
of this drill has been about.

55:01.172 --> 55:05.135
No! It was about you
checking a fucking box, a regulation,

55:05.218 --> 55:07.887
a law, whatever the fuck,
because you know what?

55:08.305 --> 55:11.725
-You know what? We're not safe.
-[guard] That's enough.

55:11.808 --> 55:14.185
Hey, fuck you, "that's enough."
Who are you?

55:14.269 --> 55:16.104

-Am I safer now?

Huh? I've got your gun!
I've got your gun! Am I safer?

55:25.196 --> 55:26.531
-Please.
-Look at me, I'm armed.

55:26.614 --> 55:30.035
Should I give this to a teacher
so they can save their fucking class?

55:30.243 --> 55:31.828
Clay, please.

55:32.704 --> 55:36.499
Put the gun down. We'll go to my office,
and we will talk this over, OK?

What did you do?

-Hey!

Get off me! Get off of me now!
