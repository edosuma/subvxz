00:00.001 --> 00:01.839
There's something we want
to talk to you about.

00:02.105 --> 00:04.756
It's so easy to get
caught up in the chaos.

00:04.781 --> 00:08.053
I think he's struggling with
you guys almost getting divorced

00:08.077 --> 00:10.322
and then a new baby half-sister.

00:10.347 --> 00:12.080
Just when you put out one fire...

00:12.105 --> 00:13.585
You keep saying that you need to know

00:13.610 --> 00:14.814
who you are without cancer.

00:14.839 --> 00:17.440
Maybe I need to figure
out who I am without you.

00:17.465 --> 00:18.595
... something else...

00:18.620 --> 00:20.517
- Jake, what are you doing?
- Uh...

00:20.542 --> 00:21.665
... explodes.

00:21.690 --> 00:23.235
So, are you a musician, too?

00:23.260 --> 00:24.936
You ever hear of the Red Ferns?

00:24.961 --> 00:26.962
So, how do you find the strength...

00:26.987 --> 00:30.008
You told me when I was
ready to tell you about Elliot,

00:30.033 --> 00:31.033
you were ready to listen.

00:31.058 --> 00:32.110
... to break the cycle.

00:32.134 --> 00:33.501
When you're ready to tell me

00:33.526 --> 00:35.848
that you're still in love with Maggie,
I'm ready to hear it.

00:35.872 --> 00:37.906
She could really be our birth mother.

00:37.931 --> 00:40.419
I'm sorry. I said I didn't
know where the father is.

00:40.444 --> 00:41.643
But I do know where he is.

00:41.668 --> 00:44.061
I just don't want him
to know where I am.

00:46.061 --> 00:48.153
- Alright, here we go.
- It's exciting.

00:48.178 --> 00:49.225
- Ooh!
- What's wrong?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.830
- Are you okay?
- I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

00:50.854 --> 00:53.236
- It's just cold.
- It's just cold.

00:53.951 --> 00:55.667
- Just cold.
- Okay.

00:55.692 --> 00:56.858
Now breathe.

00:58.061 --> 00:59.080
Great.

00:59.105 --> 01:00.511
I'm talking to you guys.

01:00.536 --> 01:02.102
Hmm? Us?

01:02.539 --> 01:04.385
- Good call, Doc.
- Okay.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.291
You ready for the tour?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.213
Alright, let's go.

01:08.238 --> 01:11.372
First stop, perfectly shaped head...

01:11.397 --> 01:13.485
cute button nose...

01:13.510 --> 01:15.754
two arms... and there's...

01:15.779 --> 01:17.115
Oh, whoa. Yo, is that the...

01:17.140 --> 01:18.227
It's just a finger.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.891
Boy.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.362
You wanna hear something cool?

01:25.518 --> 01:27.102
That's your baby's heartbeat.

01:29.549 --> 01:31.494
Do you want to know the gender?

01:31.519 --> 01:32.663
- Uh, yeah. We're...
- Yes.

01:32.687 --> 01:34.080
No, no. I don't want to know.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.518
It's just...

01:39.543 --> 01:40.822
No, no, no.

01:41.236 --> 01:42.963
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- It's fine.

01:42.988 --> 01:44.549
What it is...

01:45.236 --> 01:48.153
is a perfectly healthy baby.

01:48.178 --> 01:49.807
You did great.

01:50.423 --> 01:51.705
Here.

02:06.635 --> 02:08.783
I'm so glad you're in our lives.

02:11.337 --> 02:12.670
Yeah.

02:20.651 --> 02:21.797
Gary?

02:21.822 --> 02:24.361
I've never seen you this
early in the morning.

02:24.386 --> 02:25.424
What are you doing here?

02:25.449 --> 02:27.816
A few household repairs, Dan Dixon.

02:27.841 --> 02:29.896
I think the real question is,
why are you wearing that?

02:29.920 --> 02:31.886
This is Red Sox nation, son.

02:31.911 --> 02:33.892
Oh, this old thing?

02:33.917 --> 02:35.213
It's Elliot's.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.189
- He gave it to me.
- I see.

02:37.214 --> 02:39.048
I feel like there's a
switching teams joke

02:39.073 --> 02:40.113
in there somewhere.

02:40.138 --> 02:41.606
Put it on your to-do list.

02:41.631 --> 02:43.632
Alright. Left speaker up and running.

02:43.657 --> 02:44.689
Only took five minutes.

02:44.714 --> 02:47.173
Not gloating. Just making a point of it.

02:47.198 --> 02:49.847
Oh... Oh, it's the right
speaker that wasn't working.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.985
Sorry. I-I was texting.

02:54.010 --> 02:55.454
Jake is so funny.

02:55.479 --> 02:56.611
I mean, his mom told him

02:56.636 --> 02:58.523
to go to the grocery
store to buy blueberries,

02:58.548 --> 03:00.330
but on accident, he bought grapes.

03:00.355 --> 03:01.616
Isn't that funny?

03:01.641 --> 03:03.341
That's not funny.

03:03.403 --> 03:04.939
And it's by accident.

03:04.964 --> 03:06.408
Eh... You know what?

03:06.433 --> 03:07.817
I'm gonna send him a
recipe for grape muffins.

03:07.841 --> 03:08.867
Not a thing.

03:08.892 --> 03:10.758
- Bye, Mom.
- Oh, wait. Where are you going?

03:10.783 --> 03:12.471
I thought your shift wasn't 'til 11:00.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.442
Oh, yeah, it's not, but I was just gonna

03:14.467 --> 03:17.101
stop by Rome and Regina's
and get the rest of my stuff.

03:18.085 --> 03:19.330
Cute top.

03:19.355 --> 03:20.902
Thank you.

03:20.927 --> 03:23.058
- Thanks.
- She's baaaack.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.770
Don't jinx it.

03:25.386 --> 03:26.815
- Gary?
- Yeah.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.322
You've been here since 7:00.

03:28.347 --> 03:29.705
You know you don't have to do all this.

03:29.729 --> 03:31.423
Oh, I know. I just couldn't sleep.

03:31.448 --> 03:34.916
The thought of your garbage not
being properly disposal-ed...

03:34.941 --> 03:36.683
Hey, Mom,
can I have a sleepover tonight?

03:36.708 --> 03:38.230
Did you finish all your homework?

03:38.255 --> 03:40.495
- I did.
- Then yes, you can.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.089
Great. I'll go tell Elliot.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.316
W...

03:48.521 --> 03:50.842
Colin, did you hear what just happened?

03:50.867 --> 03:52.367
D just gave Danny permission

03:52.392 --> 03:54.831
to have a sleepover with his boyfriend.

03:54.856 --> 03:56.402
Oh, yes, she did. Who did?

03:56.427 --> 03:58.042
D did it. Yes, she did.

04:08.925 --> 04:11.763
Hold still, please. Just two more.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.947
Gary, he's...

04:17.971 --> 04:20.480
Gah. Stop. That's not funny. They're 13.

04:20.505 --> 04:23.267
You want to know what I
was doing when I was 13?

04:23.292 --> 04:25.700
I was trying to convince my
dad to let me have a sleepover

04:25.725 --> 04:27.566
with someone I wanted to sleep with.

04:27.591 --> 04:30.882
You are really earning that
"Best Mom Ever" mug.

04:30.907 --> 04:33.197
They like each other, but
they're... they're friends.

04:33.222 --> 04:34.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Quick question...

04:34.269 --> 04:37.211
Uh, what if Sophie wanted that
Jake guy to spend the night?

04:37.236 --> 04:38.790
Absolutely not.

04:39.394 --> 04:41.015
But this is different.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.066
Yeah, there's two Jakes.

04:42.091 --> 04:43.495
No, Danny's a young 13.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.495
A-And I'll lay down some ground rules.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.433
I see. Like?

04:47.458 --> 04:49.134
They'll... They'll sleep in there.

04:49.228 --> 04:50.228
Right in there?

04:50.253 --> 04:52.126
Yeah. And I'll make snacks in here.

04:52.151 --> 04:54.239
- Oh, you'll be right over there?
- All night long.

04:54.264 --> 04:57.398
That is Mom-speak for...
keeping an eye on them.

04:57.423 --> 04:58.941
While trusting them.

04:59.044 --> 05:00.643
With my eyes.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.895
I think it's great you invited Theo

05:03.919 --> 05:05.816
to watch you rehearse with Dakota.

05:05.841 --> 05:07.441
He talked about your new job in therapy,

05:07.466 --> 05:09.321
and it's nice for him to feel included.

05:09.346 --> 05:12.347
Oh, he's not just watching.
I gave him a part.

05:12.372 --> 05:13.379
A-one-ee and a-two-ee...

05:13.403 --> 05:15.223
- Here comes my percussion section...
- ... and a-four-ee.

05:15.247 --> 05:17.941
And a-one, two, three, four.

05:17.966 --> 05:19.565
Great syncopation, pal.

05:20.425 --> 05:22.577
Mom, clap your hands and be the beat.

05:22.602 --> 05:25.542
Not totally sure what
that means, but I'm in.

05:25.567 --> 05:28.775
A-one-ee and a-two-ee and
a-three-ee and a-four-ee

05:28.800 --> 05:30.132
and a one, two...

05:30.156 --> 05:32.986
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did the band start without me?

05:33.011 --> 05:34.679
Everybody, this is Dakota.

05:34.704 --> 05:37.058
- Hi!
- Hi, Katherine. Nice to meet you.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.618
Eddie showed us some
of your YouTube videos.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.697
Those songs are great.

05:39.722 --> 05:41.652
Wow. Great taste and beautiful.

05:41.677 --> 05:43.081
- How'd you pull that off?
- Ohh.

05:43.106 --> 05:45.050
- I like her.
- Your sweater has holes in it.

05:45.075 --> 05:47.675
And this is Theo.

05:47.700 --> 05:48.917
Yeah, you know what's cray?

05:48.942 --> 05:51.198
Is I actually paid a lot
of money for these holes.

05:51.223 --> 05:52.994
- That is cray.
- Mmhmm.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.636
I'm gonna take Charlie to the park

05:54.661 --> 05:56.745
so the professionals can work.

05:56.770 --> 05:58.370
Thanks, Mom.

05:58.395 --> 06:00.198
- Should we do this?
- Yeah, let's do this.

06:00.223 --> 06:02.023
Oh, wait. I need
something for the rehearsal.

06:02.048 --> 06:03.191
Oh. Okay.

06:03.878 --> 06:05.698
Oh, is this Charlie?

06:05.723 --> 06:06.723
Hi!

06:06.748 --> 06:08.380
It's nice to finally meet you!

06:08.405 --> 06:10.138
My mom is absolutely a fanatic

06:10.163 --> 06:11.722
about having me avoid the sun, too.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.195
Oh, yeah. They just did a study.
Every Asian mom's like that.

06:15.495 --> 06:18.762
Ooh! Speaking of hats,
that is a cute one!

06:18.787 --> 06:21.249
Do you mind if I try it on? I'm actually
looking to get something new.

06:21.273 --> 06:22.298
Ooh.

06:22.323 --> 06:24.106
I would, but it's head lice season,

06:24.131 --> 06:25.731
and I just can't risk it.

06:25.756 --> 06:27.121
Oh, that's fair.

06:27.146 --> 06:28.813
- Shall we?
- Come on.

06:40.070 --> 06:41.391
You okay?

06:41.416 --> 06:43.082
Yeah.

06:44.758 --> 06:46.927
I mean, I don't know.

06:47.411 --> 06:48.912
Did you see anything?

06:48.937 --> 06:50.660
Oh, uh, I'm just the tech.

06:50.685 --> 06:52.527
I'm not really supposed to discuss...

06:52.552 --> 06:54.232
- Yeah, of course. I just...
- Hey, Jamie.

06:54.257 --> 06:56.761
We're doing cake for Vivian's birthday.

06:56.786 --> 06:58.520
Oh. Sorry.

06:58.545 --> 07:00.588
Didn't realize you were still here.

07:00.943 --> 07:03.332
Yeah. Still here.

07:03.357 --> 07:04.481
S-Sorry.

07:04.506 --> 07:05.990
Anyway, as I was saying,

07:06.015 --> 07:07.972
the doctor will go over
everything with you

07:07.997 --> 07:09.771
when you sit down with him later today.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.740
Okay. Thank you.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.302
You're welcome.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.126
- Happy birthday!
- Save me a corner piece!

07:19.409 --> 07:22.318
? Which nobody can deny ?

07:22.343 --> 07:23.776
What'd I tell you?

07:23.801 --> 07:25.506
Best ice cream in Boston.

07:25.531 --> 07:26.884
You weren't lying.

07:26.909 --> 07:28.240
- This stuff is great.
- Mmhmm.

07:28.265 --> 07:30.685
- And there's no sugar in it?
- What?

07:30.710 --> 07:32.942
Kidding. Totally worth it.

07:32.967 --> 07:34.556
So, I'm taking a left
on Jallison, right?

07:34.580 --> 07:35.580
Yeah.

07:35.605 --> 07:37.232
Then the diner will be on your right.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.790
Thanks again for driving me.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.724
My mom used to take me for ice cream...

07:42.749 --> 07:45.049
Every Thursday when she got off work.

07:45.268 --> 07:46.834
She'd always get chocolate.

07:47.271 --> 07:49.727
Every week, I'd always try a new flavor.

07:49.752 --> 07:51.750
And if I didn't like the one I chose,

07:51.775 --> 07:53.467
she'd switch with me.

07:54.396 --> 07:55.826
She was great.

07:56.603 --> 07:58.467
You would've loved her.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.295
I lost my mom a few months ago.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.367
Can't even eat carrot cake
without thinking about her.

08:05.484 --> 08:06.724
Was that her favorite?

08:06.749 --> 08:08.271
Oh, no. She hated it.

08:08.475 --> 08:10.138
She said it ruins the carrot...

08:10.163 --> 08:12.670
"And it ruins the cake, Romey."

08:15.087 --> 08:17.099
This baby's gonna be so lucky.

08:20.223 --> 08:22.080
You can let me out right here.

08:23.529 --> 08:25.021
Don't stop! Don't stop!

08:25.046 --> 08:26.078
- What?
- Keep driving!

08:26.103 --> 08:27.269
That's Derek's car.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.342
Hey.

08:38.368 --> 08:40.053
I've been thinking about tonight.

08:40.078 --> 08:41.410
Do you know what would be fun?

08:41.436 --> 08:43.710
What if we all camped
out in the family room?

08:43.735 --> 08:45.859
Watched some movies, near the snacks?

08:45.884 --> 08:49.018
I could make some s'mores,
and then when you get thirsty,

08:49.043 --> 08:53.030
I can get you the non-alcoholic
beverage of your choice.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.958
What do you say?

08:58.040 --> 09:00.207
Okay, sweetie, look,
this is a little more complicated

09:00.232 --> 09:01.593
than a regular sleepover.

09:01.618 --> 09:03.284
It is.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.042
Elliot's moving.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.085
What?

09:07.903 --> 09:09.827
He just texted.

09:10.807 --> 09:12.805
His dad was waiting to hear about a job,

09:12.830 --> 09:14.155
and he got it.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.124
They're leaving next week.

09:19.035 --> 09:20.707
Sweetie.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.048
Okay. It's okay.

09:25.701 --> 09:28.964
Are you sure it was his car?

09:28.989 --> 09:30.316
I saw the license plate.

09:30.341 --> 09:31.714
I can't believe he found me.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.152
I was so careful.

09:33.679 --> 09:35.375
He's gonna want to see me.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.589
- Well, you're safe here, honey, okay?
- No, I'm not.

09:37.614 --> 09:39.226
He traveled all the way
from Philly to find me.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.511
You don't understand
what he's capable of.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.258
If he can find me at the diner,
he can find me anywhere.

09:46.748 --> 09:48.547
It was boiling water.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.758
My scar.

09:55.523 --> 09:57.342
I was making tea.

09:57.367 --> 10:00.559
He picked it up off the stove
and threw the whole thing at me.

10:01.109 --> 10:03.598
That was the night I decided to leave.

10:04.649 --> 10:06.450
He didn't know I was pregnant.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.247
But I knew I had to protect the baby.

10:09.272 --> 10:11.622
You did. And you did the right thing.

10:11.647 --> 10:14.059
No. Can you... Can you do me a favor?

10:14.084 --> 10:15.517
Of course.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.487
Can you go to my place?

10:17.512 --> 10:19.653
In the closet, there's a blue bag.

10:19.678 --> 10:20.990
It's already packed. Can you get it?

10:21.014 --> 10:22.146
I need to leave town.

10:22.171 --> 10:23.426
- No.
- What? No.

10:23.451 --> 10:26.393
I can't go back there,
and I can't go to work again.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.985
I promise I'll contact you
when I get to a new place,

10:29.010 --> 10:30.254
but I have to leave Boston.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.575
- Eve, you...
- Honey, you can't

10:31.600 --> 10:32.811
keep running, alright?

10:32.836 --> 10:34.736
I can make a phone call
to the Women's Shelter.

10:34.761 --> 10:37.544
N-No! No, no, no. Listen to me.

10:38.075 --> 10:41.480
Derek doesn't know that I'm pregnant,
and he can't find out.

10:41.505 --> 10:44.607
He'll use the baby as the way
to be connected to me forever.

10:44.632 --> 10:46.179
- Slow down.
- No, I don't...

10:46.204 --> 10:47.704
Take a minute.

10:49.722 --> 10:52.658
He's at the diner right now,
waiting for me.

10:52.683 --> 10:55.650
And when I don't show up,
he's gonna come looking for me.

10:55.675 --> 10:57.308
Please. Please.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.466
It's alright.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.790
Okay.

11:00.108 --> 11:01.241
It's okay.

11:03.691 --> 11:05.979
And then after A minor, it just repeats.

11:06.813 --> 11:08.932
- Oh! There it is!
- What?

11:08.957 --> 11:10.525
- That's... That's the face!
- No!

11:10.550 --> 11:11.962
- That's the poster face!
- That is not a face.

11:11.986 --> 11:13.322
This is just my face.

11:13.347 --> 11:15.471
Ooh, you know, dollar jar disagrees.

11:15.496 --> 11:17.503
Okay, well, you know what?
Correct me if I'm wrong...

11:17.527 --> 11:19.604
- You're wrong.
- But... Okay.

11:19.629 --> 11:21.393
Uh, for your information,

11:21.418 --> 11:23.079
that band right there opened up...

11:23.104 --> 11:24.118
Wait, are you gonna tell us

11:24.142 --> 11:26.342
that you, uh,
played at the Garden again?

11:26.627 --> 11:28.011
No.

11:28.036 --> 11:29.381
Where was the last place you played?

11:29.405 --> 11:30.724
Oh, yes. The Internet.

11:30.749 --> 11:32.432
Oh, well, at least it was this decade.

11:32.457 --> 11:34.307
Okay, taking it again
from the top, okay?

11:35.357 --> 11:37.760
Are we rehearsing or
are we joking around?

11:40.406 --> 11:43.407
Okay. Uh... why don't
we just take five, huh?

11:43.432 --> 11:45.071
Yeah.

11:53.262 --> 11:55.649
Well, we can't just let her
leave Boston. That's not right.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.484
I don't think it's right,
either, but we...

11:57.509 --> 11:59.463
We can't take any more
power away from her.

11:59.488 --> 12:01.424
You heard her. She's got nowhere to go.

12:01.449 --> 12:02.582
Yeah, but we can't force her

12:02.607 --> 12:04.814
to do something that
makes her feel unsafe.

12:04.839 --> 12:06.596
Then we make her safe.

12:06.621 --> 12:09.288
You don't even know
if we can do that, babe.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.228
And we can't make that decision for her.

12:13.114 --> 12:16.775
Remember what Gloria said
about not getting too involved?

12:17.885 --> 12:20.106
We have to respect her boundaries.

12:20.131 --> 12:21.231
You're right.

12:34.369 --> 12:36.169
Oh, come on.

12:41.007 --> 12:42.239
For the love of...

12:45.222 --> 12:46.531
Here. Try this.

12:46.556 --> 12:47.855
Oh. Thank you.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.793
- Here.
- Thanks.

13:38.967 --> 13:40.266
Hey.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.706
Uh, I know this is probably the
last thing you wanted to do,

13:43.731 --> 13:45.358
but I am, uh,

13:45.383 --> 13:48.175
getting my six-month
cancer screening results

13:48.200 --> 13:49.987
in an hour.

13:50.388 --> 13:53.670
I thought I could
handle it alone, but...

13:54.591 --> 13:56.733
maybe you could go with me?

13:57.911 --> 13:59.381
Of course.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.685
Yeah.

14:00.710 --> 14:01.775
Um...

14:02.334 --> 14:04.467
why don't you just text me the address

14:04.492 --> 14:06.158
and I'll meet you there?

14:06.183 --> 14:07.420
Okay. Bye.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.264
Twizz... 1.

14:10.547 --> 14:11.569
What are we playing?

14:11.594 --> 14:13.520
A cool new game
that Elliot brought over.

14:15.341 --> 14:17.240
Hey. That's my mom's mug.

14:17.468 --> 14:18.725
What?

14:18.750 --> 14:20.616
"K" is for Katherine.

14:21.745 --> 14:22.778
Oh.

14:22.803 --> 14:24.636
Sorry. I-I didn't know.

14:26.416 --> 14:28.168
"E" is for Eddie.

14:28.466 --> 14:30.029
If you want to use a mug,

14:30.054 --> 14:32.677
use one of the blank ones
that nobody cares about.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.112
Okay. Um, actually...

14:36.137 --> 14:38.393
I think I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

14:43.108 --> 14:45.354
Hey. T.

14:46.057 --> 14:47.869
That was really rude.

14:48.295 --> 14:50.534
I thought you were excited
to work with Dakota.

14:50.559 --> 14:51.651
What changed?

14:52.291 --> 14:54.160
I realized I don't like her.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.418
And why not?

14:55.443 --> 14:57.243
I don't know. I just don't.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.466
But that doesn't mean you can't be nice.

14:59.491 --> 15:00.790
She's a friend.

15:00.815 --> 15:02.994
Friends like you and Aunt Delilah?

15:04.806 --> 15:07.268
Are you gonna have a baby with her, too?

15:16.243 --> 15:18.742
Alright. The garbage disposal is fixed.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.812
Ready for all of your disposal needs.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.251
It's the island one that was broken.

15:23.277 --> 15:24.509
What?

15:25.165 --> 15:26.885
Damn it.

15:26.910 --> 15:28.376
- Winning.
- Hey.

15:28.401 --> 15:30.822
Could you watch the kids for,
like, a couple of hours?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.157
I told them already.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.548
Where are you going?

15:33.573 --> 15:35.547
Oh, I, uh...

15:36.219 --> 15:38.462
- ... just have an errand.
- 'Kay.

15:38.753 --> 15:41.422
I-I have these clothes that
I've been meaning to return

15:41.447 --> 15:42.580
for, like, 30 days,

15:42.605 --> 15:46.571
and... and I realized
that this is day 30, and, uh...

15:46.596 --> 15:48.136
I don't see any clothes.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.894
When you get there...

15:53.479 --> 15:55.547
just tell Maggie that
I'm thinking about her.

15:58.172 --> 15:59.371
She made this appointment

15:59.396 --> 16:00.674
when she first went into remission.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.921
I... put it on my calendar

16:02.946 --> 16:05.078
'cause I thought for sure
I'd be going with her.

16:05.103 --> 16:07.704
That's why you've been
playing handyman all day?

16:07.729 --> 16:10.996
Hey, you and your soft-close
drawers can thank me later.

16:13.595 --> 16:15.650
I'm glad she's not alone.

16:16.782 --> 16:18.459
It's gonna be okay.

16:18.484 --> 16:20.406
Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.748
I mean, as much I think

16:30.773 --> 16:33.946
we didn't want to
explain why it happened,

16:34.410 --> 16:36.741
maybe we didn't give him enough context.

16:36.766 --> 16:38.479
Like when we told him
that Maggie was sick

16:38.504 --> 16:40.610
and he was so scared the
next time he caught a cold.

16:40.635 --> 16:43.586
Until we explained that
that wasn't the same thing.

16:45.814 --> 16:47.789
You shouldn't have to clean this up.

16:47.814 --> 16:49.061
I'll go talk to him.

16:49.086 --> 16:50.558
No.

16:50.583 --> 16:53.797
I think we need to do it together

16:53.822 --> 16:56.474
so he sees that we're united on this.

16:56.977 --> 16:59.227
But let's wait until tuck-in.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.619
That way, we can see
what questions he has

17:01.644 --> 17:04.311
and answer them the best we can.

17:04.641 --> 17:06.140
Together.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.096
Here you go.

17:16.525 --> 17:19.165
I know you think I was
crazy to ever stay with him.

17:20.199 --> 17:21.712
I... don't.

17:21.737 --> 17:23.601
We really did love each other.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.618
The first time it happened,
he was so upset.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.259
He was so sorry.

17:30.214 --> 17:32.353
If you understood the
house he grew up in...

17:32.378 --> 17:34.211
You don't have to defend yourself.

17:35.281 --> 17:37.581
Sometimes the people
you're supposed to trust

17:37.606 --> 17:39.126
let you down.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.217
You know how...

17:47.242 --> 17:49.881
I gave money to that women's shelter?

17:50.967 --> 17:53.248
It wasn't my money.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.740
It was my uncle's.

17:58.129 --> 18:00.920
On our birthday,
my dad would mark our heights.

18:01.688 --> 18:02.873
No cheating.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.279
Okay, I won't. I won't.

18:05.254 --> 18:06.344
Okay.

18:08.617 --> 18:09.920
Okay.

18:09.945 --> 18:12.756
Now write your name so when
you come back and visit,

18:12.781 --> 18:14.786
we can see how much you've grown.

18:14.811 --> 18:17.174
Mom says that Hartford's
gonna be a new start for us,

18:17.199 --> 18:20.200
but... I kind of like who I am here.

18:20.831 --> 18:22.631
I like who you are, too.

18:25.941 --> 18:28.137
Can I come out of the pantry now?

18:29.839 --> 18:31.817
Now you'll always know I was here.

18:37.195 --> 18:38.317
Look up.

18:40.247 --> 18:41.346
It's perfect.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.067
I was here, damn it. Until I wasn't.

18:52.083 --> 18:55.730
_

19:03.113 --> 19:04.792
Okay.

19:05.066 --> 19:06.794
Who wants to watch a
mindless action movie

19:06.819 --> 19:09.453
with a bunch of bald
dudes and fast cars?

19:09.478 --> 19:11.149
Way ahead of you.

19:18.017 --> 19:19.050
Sorry.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.324
I know it's annoying. It's a bad habit.

19:21.349 --> 19:22.589
It's fine.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.220
Thank you for being here with me, D.

19:25.846 --> 19:27.629
I didn't sleep at all last night.

19:27.653 --> 19:30.238
Hey, did you guys catch
the Bruins game last...

19:31.288 --> 19:32.597
Oh. Hello.

19:32.622 --> 19:34.642
Um, this is my friend Delilah.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.323
Well, Delilah, you're just in time

19:36.348 --> 19:38.253
to hear me tell Maggie good news.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.710
Maggie, your numbers are solid.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.131
Axillary lymph nodes are down to size.

19:44.156 --> 19:46.323
Everything looks great.

19:48.048 --> 19:49.314
That's it.

19:50.694 --> 19:52.595
That's fantastic.

19:53.330 --> 19:54.924
It really is.

19:59.882 --> 20:02.495
Oh, uh, by the way, before you go,

20:02.520 --> 20:05.199
let's get your next six-month
screening on the books.

20:07.180 --> 20:08.480
Right.

20:09.548 --> 20:10.980
Yeah, of course.

20:19.111 --> 20:20.875
So, you never got
a chance to confront him?

20:20.900 --> 20:21.900
Nope.

20:21.925 --> 20:24.105
He died just before I got there.

20:24.130 --> 20:26.269
I am so glad he's gone.

20:26.534 --> 20:28.097
I mean...

20:28.122 --> 20:30.720
'cause now I know he
can't hurt anyone else.

20:30.745 --> 20:34.281
But a part of me wishes I
could have stood up to him.

20:34.306 --> 20:37.353
Girl, I practiced what I was
gonna say a thousand times.

20:37.378 --> 20:40.252
I practiced what I was
gonna say to Derek, too.

20:40.277 --> 20:42.423
In the end,
I left in the middle of the night.

20:43.266 --> 20:45.059
I was afraid that...

20:45.084 --> 20:47.087
if I talked to him, I'd stay.

20:51.134 --> 20:53.280
That chili was delicious and spicy.

20:53.305 --> 20:54.846
- I thought you liked spicy.
- I do.

20:54.871 --> 20:56.368
But the baby's kicking.

20:56.719 --> 20:57.972
Mm.

20:58.719 --> 21:00.155
You want to feel?

21:00.180 --> 21:01.275
Can I?

21:01.300 --> 21:02.833
Mm-hmm.

21:05.201 --> 21:06.633
I don't feel.

21:07.972 --> 21:09.288
Oh!

21:09.313 --> 21:11.227
Hello there.

21:11.258 --> 21:13.055
He just kicked hello back.

21:13.515 --> 21:14.881
He?

21:14.906 --> 21:16.727
It's just a feeling.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.392
- Oh!
- Oh.

21:19.417 --> 21:21.132
The baby just kicked my bladder.

21:21.157 --> 21:22.830
Back in a few.

21:22.855 --> 21:24.208
Okay.

21:27.584 --> 21:28.683
Hmm.

21:34.688 --> 21:36.087
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:36.112 --> 21:37.353
Where is she?

21:37.378 --> 21:39.339
She's in the bathroom.
Are you okay?

21:39.364 --> 21:40.503
Was he there?

21:40.528 --> 21:42.326
Oh, no. No.

21:42.351 --> 21:44.618
But the whole time I
was driving over there,

21:44.654 --> 21:47.488
every red car I passed,
I thought it was his.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.723
When I was inside of her place,

21:49.748 --> 21:52.103
every sound I heard, every shadow I saw,

21:52.128 --> 21:53.460
I thought it was him.

21:53.485 --> 21:55.035
I just kept thinking he
was gonna show up.

21:55.059 --> 21:58.309
And if it's like that
for me for 20 minutes,

21:58.334 --> 22:00.433
what's it like for her all the time?

22:00.631 --> 22:03.122
- We can't let her go.
- I totally agree.

22:03.551 --> 22:06.150
I know we promised Eve we would
love and protect her baby,

22:06.175 --> 22:09.887
but right now, the person
we need to protect is Eve.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.746
Come here.

22:15.895 --> 22:17.423
I spoke to Wendy at the shelter,

22:17.448 --> 22:20.284
and even though Rome and
I wanted you to stay here,

22:20.309 --> 22:22.699
she said the safest place for you to be

22:22.724 --> 22:24.559
- is in the safe house.
- Yeah.

22:25.457 --> 22:26.471
Okay.

22:26.496 --> 22:27.693
One of my best friends is a lawyer,

22:27.717 --> 22:30.361
and her firm can help us get a
restraining order against Derek.

22:30.386 --> 22:33.184
We can call her right now,
if that's what you want to do.

22:35.691 --> 22:37.114
Thank you.

22:39.423 --> 22:42.262
Yo. Get over here. I
want you to try this.

22:42.575 --> 22:45.176
I added some buffalo
wing sauce to the butter

22:45.201 --> 22:47.410
to give this...

22:47.435 --> 22:49.145
just a little kick.

22:50.554 --> 22:51.554
Be honest.

22:52.889 --> 22:54.426
Hmm.

22:55.387 --> 22:56.731
Tastes really strange.

22:56.756 --> 22:58.332
And irresistible, am I right?

22:58.357 --> 23:00.864
Speaking of which,
how's it going over there?

23:02.326 --> 23:03.992
It's...

23:04.017 --> 23:05.145
It's good, I guess.

23:05.170 --> 23:06.803
What do you mean you guess?

23:06.828 --> 23:08.176
You're watching a killer movie

23:08.201 --> 23:10.824
with more bass than you
thought was humanly possible,

23:10.849 --> 23:12.181
kid next to you is digging you

23:12.206 --> 23:14.540
almost as much as he's
gonna dig this popcorn.

23:14.565 --> 23:15.965
What's the problem?

23:16.499 --> 23:20.106
I'm having so much fun,
it's making me sad.

23:21.282 --> 23:23.942
Do you know how hard it was
to find someone who gets me?

23:23.967 --> 23:25.867
Yeah. I do.

23:26.612 --> 23:28.082
We have a connection.

23:29.598 --> 23:31.160
Well, man, you know I get it.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.676
Have you talked to her today?

23:33.701 --> 23:35.167
No.

23:35.192 --> 23:37.074
Nah, I didn't think it was my place.

23:37.636 --> 23:39.574
It's just, uh...

23:41.423 --> 23:43.535
If it's good news,
I want to celebrate with her.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.496
If it's bad news,
I want to be there for her.

23:47.623 --> 23:49.497
That's why you've been
acting so weird, isn't it?

23:49.521 --> 23:51.621
Weird or amazing?

23:51.646 --> 23:53.192
- Weird.
- Amazing?

23:53.217 --> 23:54.301
Weird.

23:54.326 --> 23:55.459
Amazing.

23:56.073 --> 23:59.192
You think Elliot and I can stay
friends even after he moves?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.834
You know what, pal?

24:02.859 --> 24:05.157
Don't think about tomorrow, okay?

24:05.268 --> 24:07.055
Just enjoy tonight.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.149
Every second of it.

24:08.174 --> 24:10.485
Here... take that bowl of
deliciousness over to your dude

24:10.510 --> 24:12.610
before Colin and I eat all of it.

24:15.190 --> 24:16.690
Come watch the movie with us.

24:16.715 --> 24:19.864
Oh, no. No, no. I signed a
very strict no third-wheel clause.

24:19.889 --> 24:22.289
You were with us on our
first date at the arcade.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.817
So why not be with us on our last date?

24:25.399 --> 24:28.411
I thought you said Elliot didn't
think the arcade was a date.

24:28.436 --> 24:29.969
He didn't.

24:29.994 --> 24:31.527
But he thinks this is.

24:31.797 --> 24:32.879
Come on.

24:34.952 --> 24:36.371
You okay?

24:36.877 --> 24:38.798
Yeah.

24:40.358 --> 24:41.965
It's just...

24:43.865 --> 24:45.198
When I was lying in that tube,

24:45.223 --> 24:47.231
I kept thinking about my friend Elena.

24:47.256 --> 24:48.655
She...

24:48.680 --> 24:51.465
She fell apart at her remission party

24:51.490 --> 24:53.739
'cause she was so
afraid of it coming back.

24:54.834 --> 24:57.148
I've spent so much time

24:57.173 --> 24:58.914
trying to wrap my head around the fact

24:58.939 --> 25:00.873
that I have the rest
of my life ahead of me,

25:00.898 --> 25:02.031
but the fact is,

25:02.056 --> 25:05.476
I only get that life
six months at a time.

25:05.501 --> 25:07.664
I mean, it came back once.

25:07.689 --> 25:08.945
It could come back again.

25:08.970 --> 25:09.984
Oh, Maggie.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.209
No, that was...

25:11.234 --> 25:13.258
that was always Gary's outlook.

25:13.283 --> 25:14.986
Not mine. But...

25:15.783 --> 25:17.345
I finally get it.

25:18.728 --> 25:20.501
Why didn't you call him?

25:21.310 --> 25:22.978
Honestly, I wanted to,

25:23.003 --> 25:25.587
but that's not who we are right now.

25:27.231 --> 25:29.575
I mean, part of
the reason we broke up is

25:29.600 --> 25:33.013
because we couldn't separate
ourselves from cancer.

25:33.038 --> 25:37.099
I think that if we're gonna
find a way to just be friends,

25:37.124 --> 25:39.302
cancer can't be a part of it.

25:39.327 --> 25:40.426
Mm-hmm.

25:41.319 --> 25:42.833
Could you do me a favor?

25:42.858 --> 25:44.817
Could you tell him I'm okay?

25:44.842 --> 25:47.083
Yeah. Of course.

25:47.405 --> 25:48.841
Thanks.

25:50.859 --> 25:51.860
On the way over,

25:51.884 --> 25:54.372
I reached out to my colleague
who works in family law.

25:54.397 --> 25:57.474
He told me the steps for filing
an emergency restraining order.

25:57.499 --> 26:00.005
It lasts 10 days, and in that time,

26:00.030 --> 26:01.963
we can petition for a
more permanent one.

26:02.274 --> 26:07.243
Uh, were you able to document
any of the prior abuse?

26:08.426 --> 26:10.958
I know. You shouldn't have to prove it.

26:12.691 --> 26:14.052
It was last May.

26:14.077 --> 26:15.741
Our neighbor called the police.

26:15.766 --> 26:19.255
But by the time they got there,
he had calmed down,

26:19.280 --> 26:21.013
and I didn't want to make it worse.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.604
Well, they keep a record of every call.

26:22.629 --> 26:23.808
I'll start digging.

26:24.499 --> 26:27.106
I don't know if this helps,
but we can call Dr. Thune

26:27.131 --> 26:29.677
and see if she'd document
the scar on your shoulder.

26:29.702 --> 26:31.107
But there's no proof that he did it.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.520
It's a start.

26:32.545 --> 26:34.012
I can get you a form to sign

26:34.037 --> 26:36.106
that will release your
medical records to me,

26:36.131 --> 26:38.005
uh, so I can start the ball rolling.

26:38.740 --> 26:41.458
I only have about $300 saved.

26:41.483 --> 26:42.749
Don't worry about it.

26:42.774 --> 26:45.041
For all the complaining
I do about my firm,

26:45.066 --> 26:47.433
they're really good about
doing pro bono work.

26:52.773 --> 26:55.508
I'll call you first thing in
the morning when I get into the office.

26:56.084 --> 26:58.946
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate this, Katherine.

26:58.971 --> 27:01.727
It's really cool your firm
does so much pro bono work.

27:02.452 --> 27:04.890
Uh, they don't.

27:06.267 --> 27:08.834
But... I wish they did.

27:09.774 --> 27:11.073
Thank you.

27:11.751 --> 27:13.821
We all know an Eve.

27:24.111 --> 27:25.892
I don't think you like popcorn.

27:25.917 --> 27:27.892
I just think you like
the sound it makes.

27:33.134 --> 27:34.595
Hey, D.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.221
Whoa. Oh.

27:36.246 --> 27:37.440
Thought you were your mom.

27:37.464 --> 27:38.863
How was work?

27:38.888 --> 27:41.650
It was exhausting.
I don't know how you guys do it.

27:41.675 --> 27:42.806
I don't.

27:44.094 --> 27:45.493
Oh. Oh, it's Jake.

27:45.518 --> 27:47.290
Hey, Danny,
did I tell you today about...

27:47.315 --> 27:49.243
Him mistaking grapes for blueberries?

27:49.268 --> 27:50.892
Yeah. Hilarious.

27:52.948 --> 27:54.681
Hi!

27:55.216 --> 27:57.736
Traffic was light? That's awesome!

27:57.870 --> 27:59.643
How was your game?

28:17.938 --> 28:19.292
What?

28:20.100 --> 28:22.167
Just... car chases.

28:22.192 --> 28:23.887
Get me every time. You know that.

28:27.629 --> 28:30.698
_

28:46.984 --> 28:48.450
How'd it go?

28:49.584 --> 28:51.258
She's going through a lot.

28:51.283 --> 28:52.883
But I hope I can help.

28:52.908 --> 28:54.995
Did my jobs. Time for cuddles.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.453
Great.

28:56.665 --> 28:58.136
Hey, bud.

28:58.161 --> 28:59.831
We actually want to talk to you.

28:59.856 --> 29:02.651
I want to do cuddles
with just Mom tonight.

29:04.405 --> 29:06.175
Okay, T.

29:07.049 --> 29:09.401
But say good night to Dad first.

29:10.835 --> 29:12.464
Night, Dad.

29:18.648 --> 29:20.445
What's on your mind, T?

29:22.063 --> 29:24.624
Dad and Aunt Delilah had Charlie.

29:24.649 --> 29:27.399
What if the same thing
happens with Dakota?

29:33.641 --> 29:36.876
Do you remember Uncle Jon?

29:38.346 --> 29:40.221
Of course.

29:40.781 --> 29:43.900
He always picked me up
and turned me upside-down.

29:44.448 --> 29:47.228
Ahhh, Theo.

29:48.145 --> 29:50.211
He always listened to me.

29:50.524 --> 29:52.301
He understood me.

29:52.326 --> 29:54.549
He was my friend.

29:55.547 --> 29:58.908
Just my friend.

30:03.477 --> 30:05.094
Okay.

30:06.077 --> 30:07.680
It's just...

30:08.320 --> 30:11.944
I don't want you to have to
go to the Grand Canyon again.

30:23.016 --> 30:24.267
Hey, guys.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.195
Hey.

30:35.079 --> 30:36.545
What was that for?

30:36.570 --> 30:39.609
I know it was a big deal to
let me have this sleepover.

30:40.314 --> 30:41.517
Thanks.

30:41.542 --> 30:42.608
Of course.

30:42.633 --> 30:45.256
- How's Maggie?
- She's good.

30:45.281 --> 30:47.211
- How's Gary?
- He's good.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.765
Yeah? How was the movie?

30:48.790 --> 30:51.820
Well, two of us made it
past the first car chase.

30:52.397 --> 30:53.896
Should we wake him up?

30:53.921 --> 30:55.655
No. Let's let him sleep.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.158
I'll cover him with
Sophie's sleeping bag.

30:57.182 --> 30:59.242
I sure am very
tempted to tickle his feet.

31:03.114 --> 31:04.780
Thanks, sleeping bag.

31:04.805 --> 31:05.953
I mean...

31:07.163 --> 31:08.930
Good night, baby.

31:10.416 --> 31:11.609
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

31:11.634 --> 31:13.898
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

31:14.368 --> 31:15.734
Good night, Elliot.

31:15.759 --> 31:16.828
Good night.

31:25.406 --> 31:27.336
The Grand Canyon? He said that?

31:27.361 --> 31:29.758
Not surprisingly,
our son catches everything.

31:29.783 --> 31:30.883
I am so sorry.

31:30.908 --> 31:32.079
I'm gonna call the label and tell them

31:32.103 --> 31:33.953
I can't work with Dakota anymore.

31:33.978 --> 31:35.390
What are you talking about?

31:35.415 --> 31:38.492
You're not just working
with Dakota for you, Eddie.

31:38.517 --> 31:40.844
It's for us. It's for our whole family.

31:40.869 --> 31:42.648
You bringing in extra income

31:42.673 --> 31:45.140
means that I get to stay
home with Theo more.

31:45.726 --> 31:47.183
And the fact is,

31:47.208 --> 31:49.015
there's always gonna be another Dakota.

31:55.932 --> 31:58.104
Look, I'm sorry that
you had to be the one

31:58.129 --> 31:59.627
to help him through this.

32:00.713 --> 32:03.971
You know, I saw how the truth
affected Delilah and her kids.

32:04.616 --> 32:06.619
I guess I just wasn't prepared

32:06.644 --> 32:08.502
for how it was gonna affect Theo.

32:10.356 --> 32:13.257
But this is part of our story now.

32:15.145 --> 32:17.111
And it always will be.

32:34.385 --> 32:35.869
You know what, dude?

32:36.976 --> 32:38.596
If you'd gone to the bathroom last night

32:38.621 --> 32:41.243
instead of digging up
D's chrysanthemums...

32:49.837 --> 32:51.143
Aww.

32:53.073 --> 32:54.221
Alright.

33:00.554 --> 33:01.792
What?

33:02.736 --> 33:04.150
Stop it!

33:05.076 --> 33:06.667
Ooh.

33:12.882 --> 33:14.846
I want to show you something.

33:16.318 --> 33:17.948
Hey, bud.

33:17.973 --> 33:19.672
I need you to look at this.

33:24.631 --> 33:28.049
These are the vows I made
for your mom on our wedding day.

33:28.455 --> 33:30.104
You know what a vow is?

33:31.493 --> 33:32.823
It's like a promise.

33:32.848 --> 33:35.182
It's the most serious
promise you can make.

33:35.689 --> 33:37.550
And it's what you say on
the day you get married.

33:37.574 --> 33:43.471
You promise to love, cherish,
and honor the person

33:43.496 --> 33:45.296
for as long you live.

33:48.295 --> 33:49.940
Yeah, you're right.

33:51.719 --> 33:53.307
I didn't do that.

33:54.067 --> 33:57.034
Having a baby with Aunt Delilah...

33:58.727 --> 34:00.827
I broke my vows.

34:00.852 --> 34:03.687
And as much as I love Charlie,

34:03.712 --> 34:06.194
it is something I am not proud of.

34:07.539 --> 34:09.375
But I want you to know...

34:10.319 --> 34:12.312
it won't ever happen again.

34:12.791 --> 34:14.539
How do you know?

34:17.851 --> 34:20.297
Well... there are a lot of reasons.

34:21.417 --> 34:23.484
But one of the big ones is

34:23.509 --> 34:25.867
I saw how much it hurt you and Mom,

34:25.891 --> 34:27.531
and I saw...

34:28.063 --> 34:31.931
how you looked at me differently
because of what I did.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.953
Mom has agreed to
give me another chance.

34:35.991 --> 34:39.101
And I hope that I can convince you

34:39.126 --> 34:40.492
to give me one, too.

34:48.605 --> 34:50.105
You can.

34:51.376 --> 34:54.234
Hey, Mom. Dad was just
talking about your wedding.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.085
- Was there cake?
- Oh, don't ask.

34:56.110 --> 34:57.711
That's a long story.

34:58.820 --> 34:59.821
If you're done with breakfast,

34:59.845 --> 35:01.679
clear your bowl and do your jobs, okay?

35:07.970 --> 35:09.609
I'll be in my room!

35:11.371 --> 35:14.372
When I was tucking Theo in,
we talked about Jon.

35:14.636 --> 35:17.604
And I realized I hadn't thought
about him in a few days.

35:19.025 --> 35:22.122
When he died, I thought
about him all the time, and...

35:22.654 --> 35:25.637
I never thought there'd
be a day when I wouldn't.

35:27.932 --> 35:32.401
Ever since you've been back,
you've done everything right.

35:32.977 --> 35:35.450
It's not... that.

35:35.475 --> 35:37.122
It's just...

35:38.149 --> 35:41.317
There are certain things you
think you'll never get over.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.450
But then you realize...

35:46.624 --> 35:48.997
maybe it just takes time.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.932
Uh... here's a little life hack,
free of charge.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.299
Roll your clothes.

36:04.324 --> 36:06.830
More space, fewer wrinkles.

36:08.036 --> 36:10.104
Uncle Gary taught me that.

36:10.987 --> 36:14.674
Uh, yeah, no offense, dude,
but your uncle is super weird.

36:14.699 --> 36:16.119
Right?

36:18.794 --> 36:20.760
Elliot, your dad's here!

36:22.165 --> 36:23.464
Alright.

36:31.346 --> 36:32.986
Um...

36:33.509 --> 36:34.942
I g... I got it.

36:35.356 --> 36:36.555
Um...

36:47.647 --> 36:49.131
Danny Dixon...

36:49.579 --> 36:53.170
you changed my life...
And how I pack... forever.

37:14.246 --> 37:15.498
Is this from...?

37:15.523 --> 37:17.522
First time we hung out at the arcade?

37:18.209 --> 37:19.409
Yeah.

37:25.927 --> 37:28.770
Hey, Elliot? Time to go, sport.

37:36.576 --> 37:39.051
- Goodbye.
- Bye. Good luck.

37:46.701 --> 37:47.767
Hey.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.817
Hey. Uh...

37:49.842 --> 37:52.356
I'm calling because
I should have texted,

37:52.381 --> 37:54.379
and I didn't text...

37:54.671 --> 37:56.371
because, um...

37:56.396 --> 38:01.223
well, uh, I wanted
to respect your boundaries.

38:01.255 --> 38:04.043
I know Delilah told you that I'm okay,

38:04.068 --> 38:05.980
but I wanted to tell you, too.

38:06.005 --> 38:09.160
So... I'm calling to say...

38:09.185 --> 38:10.251
I'm okay.

38:10.276 --> 38:14.301
And sorry for... not texting.

38:15.140 --> 38:18.004
Well, Bloom, I'm glad you're okay.

38:18.588 --> 38:20.402
I'm also glad you called.

38:21.326 --> 38:22.717
Thanks.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.336
It gets easier, you know.

38:27.361 --> 38:28.393
What?

38:28.921 --> 38:32.039
Living six months to six months.

38:32.189 --> 38:34.356
So, Delilah told you?

38:34.381 --> 38:35.484
Told me what?

38:35.509 --> 38:38.043
Uh, she and I
were just talking about how...

38:39.533 --> 38:41.023
Nothing.

38:42.524 --> 38:44.320
Did you hear Elliot's moving away?

38:45.319 --> 38:46.952
Yeah.

38:47.554 --> 38:49.797
D told me. How's Danny?

38:50.894 --> 38:52.570
He's sad.

38:53.291 --> 38:56.156
He thinks he's never gonna
meet anyone else who gets him.

38:57.641 --> 38:59.021
Which is understandable...

38:59.045 --> 39:02.145
considering the fact he owns
a staggering number of action figures.

39:03.028 --> 39:04.723
He'll find someone.

39:05.817 --> 39:07.293
Yeah, I know.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.653
Well, I should go...

39:14.678 --> 39:17.312
eat a huge stack of pancakes.

39:18.475 --> 39:20.278
Stay healthy, Bloom.

39:22.078 --> 39:23.793
You too, Mendez.

39:30.647 --> 39:32.106
How's Eve doing?

39:32.131 --> 39:34.200
Gina's women's shelter
found her a place.

39:34.225 --> 39:35.481
That's great.

39:35.798 --> 39:37.075
What about her job?

39:37.108 --> 39:39.770
You know what? She's gonna be fine.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.088
She just found something.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.183
Success.

39:50.621 --> 39:53.018
Hey, do you want any
more cinnamon roll pancakes

39:53.043 --> 39:54.435
before you head out?

39:54.459 --> 39:56.129
Uh...

39:56.154 --> 39:57.808
we just took one lap around the block.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.847
I don't know if I
earned a third breakfast.

39:59.872 --> 40:01.204
So, no?

40:01.229 --> 40:02.254
How you doing?

40:02.279 --> 40:04.113
I think last night went well.

40:04.138 --> 40:06.379
Mm-hmm. Right? Crisis averted.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.738
Danny got to say goodbye to Elliot,

40:08.763 --> 40:10.660
Maggie got the all-clear,

40:10.685 --> 40:12.777
and Sophie's back in the house.

40:13.208 --> 40:14.566
So, if you need me,

40:14.591 --> 40:17.551
I'm gonna be, uh, drinking
my coffee over here

40:18.001 --> 40:20.269
out of my "Best Mom" mug.

40:20.703 --> 40:22.918
The one that I earned.

40:24.582 --> 40:25.949
Well...

40:25.974 --> 40:29.207
you're about to earn some overtime.

40:31.956 --> 40:34.219
Look what I found.

40:35.876 --> 40:38.626
Please tell me that's left over
from when you were in chemo.

40:38.651 --> 40:40.523
I wish they were. Believe me.

40:40.548 --> 40:43.094
No, I found those
in the pink sleeping bag.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.548
Ohh.

40:44.573 --> 40:46.297
You should have saved the pancakes

40:46.322 --> 40:48.454
in case Soph gets the munchies.

40:50.127 --> 40:52.321
She's baaack.

40:59.473 --> 41:00.984
Okay.
